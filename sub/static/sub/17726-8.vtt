"Oh, how's Patrick?"

00:06.807 --> 00:08.842
I love him.
I know he loves me.

to a NASCAR race before?

00:12.080 --> 00:13.181
- No.

- But I want to go.

- And there's one in Sonoma.
- We have to do it.

00:17.851 --> 00:20.554
- I'm done gossiping about her.
- It's not about Lala!

00:20.588 --> 00:21.955
It's not about her.

00:21.989 --> 00:24.425
- You cannot accept
that you f---ed up.

00:24.458 --> 00:25.926
- Oh, my God.

00:25.959 --> 00:27.628
I'm supposed to fly across
the country with you in a week?

00:27.661 --> 00:28.929
How the f---
am I supposed to do that?

00:28.962 --> 00:31.465
- You're supposed to be
our best friend.

Me and Grandma talk about this

01:07.568 --> 01:09.002
We immediately
fell in love with you.

01:09.036 --> 01:10.138

01:10.171 --> 01:11.305
- No, and I'm not
just saying that.

- Aww.
- This is good.

01:13.941 --> 01:15.343
This is really good.
- Yeah.

01:15.376 --> 01:16.644
- I mean,
how much for all these?

01:16.677 --> 01:18.346
- Did you stay on your budget?
- I wanted to--

01:18.379 --> 01:20.214
I wanted to keep it,
you know, under, like, 15.

01:20.248 --> 01:21.649
- Did you?
- That wasn't realistic.

01:21.682 --> 01:23.617
- Until we found out,
like, our final count and stuff,

01:23.651 --> 01:24.752
that's gonna obviously, like,

01:24.785 --> 01:26.654
change the old,
you know, number.

01:26.687 --> 01:29.590
I was born and raised
in Park City, Utah,

01:29.623 --> 01:32.960
and four years ago,
my parents separated,

01:32.993 --> 01:35.429
and so my mother
moved to Las Vegas

01:35.463 --> 01:36.830
to be with my grandma.

01:36.864 --> 01:39.267
Because I have to hand-stuff
all these invitations,

01:39.300 --> 01:40.834

to help with that.

Here we go.

- Here's my pile.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.740

that for my wedding invitation,

01:46.774 --> 01:49.643
I wanted it to be something
that was a keepsake,

01:49.677 --> 01:52.846
so I came across
this tea towel idea,

01:52.880 --> 01:55.683
to have the wedding invitation
printed on the towel,

01:55.716 --> 01:57.485
and I thought it was beautiful.

01:57.518 --> 01:59.820

02:03.524 --> 02:04.692
it was gonna be
a towel like this.

02:04.725 --> 02:06.260
- No, a tea towel.

02:06.294 --> 02:09.463
- It's $18.50.

02:09.497 --> 02:12.666
That is so much money for a rag.

02:12.700 --> 02:13.834
- Bubba,
I got to get out of here.

02:13.867 --> 02:15.369
You did an amazing job.
- Where are you going?

02:15.403 --> 02:17.205
- I got to go get
my suit consultation.

02:17.205 --> 02:19.072

- I'm gonna get it bespoke.

A totally separate source.

03:03.251 --> 03:04.452

03:04.485 --> 03:06.387

like, seven separate sources

03:06.420 --> 03:07.455

about the Range Rover.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.996
- Lala's telling the truth,
and everyone is lying.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.999
- My son had one.
It was $750 a month to lease it.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.635
- Katie. $750 a month.

03:21.669 --> 03:23.604
- Uncle Al had a Range Rover.
- What?

03:23.637 --> 03:25.973
So who's paying
the $750 a month?

03:26.006 --> 03:28.309

- Our Montauk trip.

03:41.822 --> 03:44.091

in three days.

a private beach,

like, free rein

and do whatever.

what Montauk is.

Like, nautical themed.

Are there many?

Don't react.

Don't respond.
Don't encourage.

there's gonna be some major
drunken explosions in Montauk.

in jail.

like, get away with some sh--

She's irrational.

06:18.178 --> 06:19.780
express all their feelings,
but you can't.

06:19.813 --> 06:21.682
- Because I'm a pushover,
and I'll forgive them.

how to feel.

06:32.460 --> 06:33.561
You shouldn't be mad at this.

06:33.594 --> 06:34.995
Oh, you should
be upset with this.

my mouth shut for a while

06:50.844 --> 06:52.079
why Stassi and Katie
are so mad at me.

has wanted me to do

you have to do is,

07:14.902 --> 07:16.236
just don't talk to them.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.304
Nothing.
Don't respond.

Don't do anything,

and how, like--

07:21.575 --> 07:25.012
maybe knock some sense into 'em
that they do need you.

what to do about this trip.

- Huh?

07:46.299 --> 07:48.268

and then feel bad.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.538

- What's up?

07:59.847 --> 08:01.849
How are you, my friend?
- Oh, yeah. How you feeling?

08:01.882 --> 08:03.383
- Thanks for coming, guys.
A lot better.

08:03.416 --> 08:05.052
Yeah, it's a pretty big
deal for me.

08:05.085 --> 08:07.788
It's like the first f---ing gig
away from Pump and Sur.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.089
I'm on Sunset Boulevard,

08:09.122 --> 08:11.625
in between the Whisky a Go Go
and the famous Roxy.

08:11.659 --> 08:13.594
I love DJ'ing,
that's my passion,

08:13.627 --> 08:15.328
and if I can't do it
at Sur and Pump,

08:15.362 --> 08:16.363
then I'm gonna go do it

08:16.396 --> 08:17.731
at the next place
that'll hire me

08:17.765 --> 08:19.567
and show Lisa
that I can be the best.

08:19.600 --> 08:20.568
So things are looking up.
- Cool.

08:20.601 --> 08:21.635
- I just got to stay focused,
you know?

08:21.669 --> 08:22.736
All right.
Let me mix, guys.

08:22.770 --> 08:23.871
- Cool.
- All right. Do your thing, man.

08:23.904 --> 08:24.938
I'll talk to you
in a little bit.

08:24.972 --> 08:25.939
- Do your thing.
We'll get a drink.

We'll see you in a minute.

08:31.779 --> 08:36.183

than Sur and Pump put together.

08:36.216 --> 08:37.284
- Oh!

08:37.317 --> 08:40.153
- Yeah, I'm a feisty
mother----er tonight.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.955
I always worry about my friends

08:41.989 --> 08:44.224
getting too comfortable
in certain positions,

08:44.257 --> 08:47.595
so I look at it
as him getting fired from Sur

08:47.595 --> 08:49.963
was almost like a blessing.

08:49.997 --> 08:52.933
He's now working
at a different bar.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.735
He's booking other DJ gigs.

08:54.768 --> 08:56.203
I'm extremely proud of him.

08:56.236 --> 08:57.771
This is the only thing
I've had tonight.

I've had.

- Oh. Good for you.
- Haven't even finished it.

09:03.310 --> 09:06.647
I've been sober
for, like, a while now.

09:06.680 --> 09:09.116
Been drinking.
- Sober for, what...

09:09.149 --> 09:11.151
I mean, who's counting,
but nine days.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.823
- Oh, so you're just sipping
sizzurp now?

09:15.856 --> 09:18.191
You're not sober.

09:18.225 --> 09:21.194
- I take, like, one sip
every, like, hour.

09:21.228 --> 09:22.295
It coats my throat.

09:22.329 --> 09:23.997
- Just because James isn't

09:24.031 --> 09:25.933
throwing back
shots of tequila,

09:25.966 --> 09:28.035
it doesn't mean he's sober.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.904
I mean, if you're chugging
the poor man's sizzurp,

09:30.938 --> 09:32.640
you're still getting f---ed up.

to her birthday party,

09:44.451 --> 09:46.286
which is different
from last year,

09:46.319 --> 09:48.021
when I didn't get an invite.

09:48.055 --> 09:49.890
- How was the birthday?
Did you all have fun?

09:49.923 --> 09:51.258
- Oh, my gosh.
It was amazing.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.293
- You have fun?

09:53.326 --> 09:55.863
- I wasn't invited.
- Ooh.

09:55.896 --> 09:57.097
- It sounds awesome.

09:57.130 --> 09:58.799
I mean,
we're going to wine country,

09:58.832 --> 10:00.400
and everybody loves wine...

10:00.433 --> 10:01.702
and NASCAR,

10:01.735 --> 10:04.337
where everybody's just proud
to be an American.

on the final list?

10:07.808 --> 10:09.710

- Schwartz.
Jax and Brittany.

10:11.311 --> 10:12.279
- Okay.

10:12.312 --> 10:13.513
I know that Jax was saying,

10:13.546 --> 10:15.683
"You know,
I just don't like Lala.

10:15.716 --> 10:17.117
She's a f---ing liar."

10:17.150 --> 10:18.652
Jax is a f---ing asshole.

10:18.686 --> 10:20.487
But f--- it.
Ariana's my girl.

10:20.520 --> 10:21.755
She invited me on this trip,

10:21.789 --> 10:23.691
so I'm gonna suck it up,
and I'm gonna go.

there's no conversation,

that Ja--like, we don't
speak one word to each other,

10:28.595 --> 10:30.230

I want to go and have
a good time on your birthday.

that's what it's about.

10:35.936 --> 10:37.370
- Yeah.

10:37.404 --> 10:38.505
- Coming up...

10:38.538 --> 10:40.941
Stassi, in my opinion,
always makes things worse.

- No more.

11:19.479 --> 11:20.647
- These cysts are--are caused

11:20.748 --> 11:22.750
from taking
a lot of supplements

11:22.750 --> 11:25.252
and screwing up
my testosterone/estrogen level.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.620
So it was my fault.
It was my doing.

on your chest?

- So I can't punch you.
- Hurts anytime I have a drink.

11:50.343 --> 11:52.780
Alcohol produces estrogen,
so it hurts my chest.

stop drinking?

on their summer bodies.

13:47.961 --> 13:49.729
- I mean, you can't
take those things back.

13:49.762 --> 13:52.399

like, in New York or something,

14:11.484 --> 14:13.686
I think Scheana
is very image-conscious.

14:13.720 --> 14:16.990
I think that she just
doesn't like to be judged,

14:17.024 --> 14:20.827

almost anything to get approval.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.589
or a new pair of sunglasses,

15:22.622 --> 15:25.258
but Lisa gets a summer car.

15:25.292 --> 15:27.694
This is the first
official invitation

15:27.727 --> 15:29.562
I'm giving someone.
- Okay, let me look at this.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.431
- Yeah.
- Okay, you go down there.

15:31.464 --> 15:33.633
I mean, that looks quite
kind of bohemian, really.

15:33.666 --> 15:35.868
- Yep.
[laughs]

15:35.902 --> 15:37.337
- Wow.

15:37.370 --> 15:38.905
[soft dramatic music]

15:39.006 --> 15:40.873
This is so unconventional.

15:40.907 --> 15:44.011
It's different.
It's unique.

15:44.011 --> 15:47.114
Maybe not quite
what I would have chosen.

15:47.147 --> 15:49.249
Oh, oh.
- Oh, hold on.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.218
- I love that.

15:51.251 --> 15:52.685
Do you love it, though?
- I love it.

15:52.719 --> 15:54.854
Look at them.
- That is so cute.

15:54.887 --> 15:56.389
That makes me feel
so much better.

15:56.423 --> 15:58.058
But it's--it's...

15:58.091 --> 16:00.160
unique, and I like that.

16:00.193 --> 16:01.694
- There is some drama
with the girls,

16:01.728 --> 16:03.330
with my bridesmaids, of course.
- Ugh.

16:03.363 --> 16:05.032
- No, it's just with Scheana.
It's just--it's just hard.

16:05.032 --> 16:06.866
- With Scheana?
- We've really tried with her

16:06.899 --> 16:10.403
to make her feel that, like,
this is not four years ago

16:10.437 --> 16:13.406
for--with me, when you want
to make it about my happiness

16:13.440 --> 16:14.574
and I'm so unhappy.

16:14.607 --> 16:16.443
- Katie, in the last six months,

16:16.476 --> 16:18.911
you've gotten angry
like Tequila Katie again.

16:18.945 --> 16:22.049
- See, I got the impression
that you had a couple of drinks

16:22.049 --> 16:24.717
and sent her a long
kind of aggressive text.

16:24.751 --> 16:26.853
- But this is--
- I know Scheana loves you.

16:26.886 --> 16:28.155
- And I love Scheana as well.

16:28.188 --> 16:29.489
- You were getting on
so well with her,

16:29.522 --> 16:31.291
and suddenly Stassi
comes back in the picture,

16:31.324 --> 16:32.959
and suddenly there's--
- It's not Stassi.

16:33.060 --> 16:34.394
It's not--it's not Stassi.
- [sighs]

16:34.427 --> 16:37.264
All the roads always lead

16:37.297 --> 16:38.598
to Miss Schroeder.

16:38.631 --> 16:39.732
Trust me.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.168
Stassi, in my opinion,

16:41.201 --> 16:42.935
always makes things worse,
not better.

16:42.969 --> 16:45.272
- She's trying--
No, she's actually trying.

16:45.305 --> 16:48.508
- I wouldn't--I'm betting she's
trying to wind you up as well.

16:48.541 --> 16:51.078
- These are my thoughts
and my feelings and my opinions.

16:51.111 --> 16:52.345
Mine, and I--if some--

16:52.379 --> 16:53.880
- Is it Katie?
- Yes, it is.

16:53.913 --> 16:55.415
- Because you have
been guilty of--

16:55.448 --> 16:57.084
- That's--okay,
that's insulting.

16:57.084 --> 17:00.120
I can think for myself.
- [exhales]

17:00.153 --> 17:03.190
[electronic music]

17:03.223 --> 17:08.428
*

17:08.461 --> 17:10.097
- Hi, good morning.
- Hi.

17:10.097 --> 17:11.864
- How are you?
- You were my nurse too.

17:11.898 --> 17:13.533
- I know
- I remember.

17:13.566 --> 17:15.001
- Okay, just bring that back up
when you're done.

17:15.102 --> 17:16.002
- Okay.

17:16.103 --> 17:17.104
I want to make this very clear

17:17.104 --> 17:19.106
that this is not
a breast reduction.

17:19.106 --> 17:20.207
A lot of men have this,

17:20.240 --> 17:22.175
especially
a lot of bodybuilders.

17:22.209 --> 17:23.610
When they're
taking supplements,

17:23.643 --> 17:25.645
some of the supplements
counteract with their body

17:25.678 --> 17:27.680
and it causes gynecomastia.

17:27.714 --> 17:28.981
I feel like we're here
every day.

17:29.015 --> 17:30.750
- I know.
- We had--we had my nose job.

17:30.783 --> 17:33.886
Is this real life?
- [laughs]

17:33.920 --> 17:35.488
- We had your boob job.

17:35.522 --> 17:38.158
- Oh, this is so nerve-racking.
- Just relax.

17:38.191 --> 17:39.326
Before you know it,
we'll be done.

17:39.359 --> 17:40.493
- All right.
- Okay.

17:40.527 --> 17:42.129
- Then I had to redo
my nose job

17:42.129 --> 17:43.363
'cause I walked into a wall.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.165
Run like this...
boom,

17:45.198 --> 17:47.367
and so I got a good ten stitches
in my forehead.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.536
- [laughs]
- Are you nervous?

17:49.569 --> 17:51.538
- Yeah, I am, actually.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.005
I think this is the one
I'm most nervous about

17:53.039 --> 17:54.441
out of all of 'em,
believe it or not.

17:54.474 --> 17:55.808
- I'll be there
to take care of you.

17:55.842 --> 17:57.410
Everything'll be fine.
Don't be worried.

17:57.444 --> 17:58.811
They know what they're doing.
- I feel like I can get

17:58.845 --> 18:00.347
one of those punch cards,
you know?

18:00.380 --> 18:01.581
- [laughs]
- Five surgeries,

18:01.614 --> 18:03.583
get the sixth one free.

18:03.616 --> 18:04.917
Hey.
- Good morning.

18:04.951 --> 18:06.453
- Hey.
[chuckles]

18:06.486 --> 18:07.887
- Hello.
- Good to see you.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.789
- Good to see you.
- Hey, good to see you again.

18:09.822 --> 18:11.158
- How are you doing?

18:11.191 --> 18:12.459
- It's getting to the point
where it's--

18:12.492 --> 18:13.826
it's starting to bother me,
so I got to get this out.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.162
- Perfect.
Listen.

18:15.195 --> 18:16.429
We'll take care of it today.
- I'm nervous.

18:16.463 --> 18:17.830
Want to get this out.
Get this done.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.866
- You'll be okay.
- Yeah, you're gonna be fine.

18:19.899 --> 18:21.201
Come on, let's head back.
- All right.

18:21.234 --> 18:22.835
I am very nervous
for the surgery, you know?

18:22.869 --> 18:24.304
They're cutting
right over my heart.

18:24.337 --> 18:25.905
Hopefully this time,
we'll get it all

18:25.938 --> 18:27.374
and I won't have
to go through this again.

18:27.407 --> 18:29.576
- Here's your bed.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.244
8:00 on the dot.

18:31.278 --> 18:32.779
[dramatic music]

18:32.812 --> 18:35.715
And scoot up just
a little bit further.

18:35.748 --> 18:37.184
*

18:37.184 --> 18:39.051
- It--it'll be done
before you even know it.

18:39.085 --> 18:41.354
For you, it'll seem like
five minutes.

18:41.388 --> 18:42.522
- Arms at 90.

18:42.555 --> 18:45.192
- Okay, let's do this.
- Okay.

18:45.225 --> 18:48.094
- I'll make an incision.
both: 8:17.

18:48.195 --> 18:51.030
- He's got this hard disk
of breast tissue,

18:51.063 --> 18:52.365
so we're gonna try
to take this out

18:52.399 --> 18:54.367
as one complete disk.

18:54.401 --> 18:57.103
All right, here it is.

18:57.204 --> 19:00.039
We'll send it to the pathologist
to ensure it's not anything.

19:00.072 --> 19:02.842
It's a pretty sizable amount
here.

19:02.875 --> 19:03.910
- Coming up...

19:03.943 --> 19:05.812
You're going to Sonoma?
- Yes.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.414
- You see?
It's things like that.

19:07.447 --> 19:09.048
People are going
to ask questions.

19:09.081 --> 19:11.751
- Well, I don't like questions,
but I like people being jealous.

19:16.956 --> 19:17.324
[upbeat music]

19:19.926 --> 19:23.530
*

19:23.563 --> 19:25.965
- Jax, you're all done
with surgery.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.335
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:28.368 --> 19:30.870
- Hi, baby.
- On the other side.

19:30.903 --> 19:33.005
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:33.039 --> 19:35.708
- Oh, you feel okay?

19:35.742 --> 19:37.410
[monitor beeping]

19:37.444 --> 19:40.647
Yeah.
- You did great, man.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.282
We got everything out,

19:42.315 --> 19:44.784
sent it off to the pathologist
just to make sure.

19:44.817 --> 19:46.118
I think you're gonna be happy.

19:46.152 --> 19:48.555
So as far as
post-op instructions,

19:48.588 --> 19:50.257
you know, while he's
on pain medicine,

19:50.290 --> 19:52.859
especially for the next
couple days to a week,

19:52.892 --> 19:55.328
uh, let's avoid alcohol.
- Yeah.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.163
- Oh, here we go again
with the no drinking.

19:57.264 --> 20:00.132
How do you go to wine country
and not have a glass of wine?

20:00.166 --> 20:01.968
I mean, how do you go
to a NASCAR race

20:02.001 --> 20:04.103
and not funnel a beer?

20:04.136 --> 20:05.338
- Otherwise,
he's gonna do great.

20:05.372 --> 20:06.973
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

20:07.006 --> 20:09.175
- Have a good day.
- You too.

20:09.208 --> 20:12.279
- I think now we're just gonna
get you home.

20:12.312 --> 20:14.914
I texted your mom, okay?

20:14.947 --> 20:17.284
[soft dramatic music]

20:17.317 --> 20:19.686
[laughing]
You're gonna touch my boob?

20:21.588 --> 20:24.324
- As long as it helps.
[laughs]

20:24.357 --> 20:27.327
[stylized music]

20:27.360 --> 20:33.800
*

20:33.833 --> 20:35.802
- Hey, Lala.
- Hi, Lisa, how are you?

20:35.835 --> 20:37.169
- Oh, my God,
look at those nails.

20:37.203 --> 20:38.938
- They're my fighting claws.
- Oh, right.

20:38.971 --> 20:40.673
Well, hopefully there won't
be any fighting around here.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.008
- Yes, I haven't needed
to use them.

20:42.041 --> 20:43.209
- Okay, good.
- Yes.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.777
You look very pretty.
- Thank you.

20:44.811 --> 20:46.212
Have you got stilts on
or something?

20:46.245 --> 20:47.447
- I do.
- Okay.

20:47.480 --> 20:48.648
And you're gonna be able
to work in those?

20:48.681 --> 20:50.049
Oh, they've got red bottoms
as well.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.217
- Yeah.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.785
- You see?
It's things like that.

20:52.819 --> 20:54.421
People are going
to ask questions.

20:54.454 --> 20:57.123
- Well, I don't like questions,
but I like people being jealous.

20:57.156 --> 20:58.525
- Okay, all right, well.

20:58.558 --> 21:00.960
The red sole is like
a red flag to me.

21:00.993 --> 21:03.930
It is Christian Louboutin,
500 bucks--

21:03.963 --> 21:05.832
not for a pair,
for one.

21:05.865 --> 21:08.134
Either this girl
is spending all her money

21:08.167 --> 21:10.403
on shoes and Hermès bracelets

21:10.437 --> 21:12.004
and not paying her rent,

21:12.038 --> 21:14.341
or there's something else
going on.

21:14.341 --> 21:16.376
You're working...

21:16.409 --> 21:17.744
this weekend?

21:17.777 --> 21:19.145
- I got my shift covered.

21:19.178 --> 21:20.547
'Cause, you know,
it's Ariana's birthday,

21:20.580 --> 21:22.582
so a few of us
are going to Sonoma.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.451
- You're going to Sonoma?
- Yes.

21:24.484 --> 21:25.685
- Okay.

21:25.718 --> 21:27.520
Well, that should be fun, right?
- Yeah.

21:27.554 --> 21:30.623
I mean, I'm just trying
to slowly work my way in

21:30.657 --> 21:34.361
and show that I'm not that bad,
but we're in very tight corners.

21:34.361 --> 21:37.697
Ariana has told me that we are
going to be staying in a cabin

21:37.730 --> 21:39.432
with one bathroom

21:39.466 --> 21:41.734
that I'll be sharing
with Jax...

21:41.768 --> 21:43.903
- Jax, what the f---
are you doing, dude?

21:43.936 --> 21:45.638
- I'm sorry.
- Tom...

21:45.672 --> 21:48.107
- Jax, don't run away
from your feelings.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.108
- Schwartz...

21:49.141 --> 21:52.379
- F---. Oh, my God.
- Okay.

21:52.379 --> 21:54.847
- I...

21:54.881 --> 21:57.384
- You created your bed,
so you're gonna lie in it.

21:57.384 --> 21:59.285
You like to create
a little problem,

21:59.386 --> 22:00.453
so you've got to deal with it.

22:00.487 --> 22:02.088
- I know.
That's the problem.

22:02.121 --> 22:04.123
- I have a certain amount
of sympathy for Lala,

22:04.156 --> 22:06.058
but she's definitely
provocative.

22:06.092 --> 22:07.794
She likes to create a situation

22:07.827 --> 22:09.396
and then she likes to be
the baby girl.

22:09.396 --> 22:10.597
Life doesn't work like that.

22:10.630 --> 22:11.898
Kill everybody with kindness.

22:11.931 --> 22:14.233
I wouldn't take your top off
at the NASCAR race

22:14.266 --> 22:16.035
if I were you.
- Got it.

22:16.068 --> 22:17.737
- But anyway, I have to go.
Enough of your nonsense.

22:17.770 --> 22:19.238
- Okay, thanks
for listening to me.

22:19.271 --> 22:20.840
- So you have a good time.
- Thank you.

22:20.873 --> 22:26.846
*

22:26.879 --> 22:29.649
- You look so good, babe.
- Thanks, babe.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.183
- Here.

22:31.217 --> 22:32.852
*

22:32.885 --> 22:34.721
- Thank you.
- Yeah, this is nice, eh?

22:34.754 --> 22:36.055
Hi.
- Hi, James, how are you doing?

22:36.088 --> 22:37.289
- How are you?
Pretty good.

22:37.323 --> 22:39.291
How about yourself?
- Welcome. Very well.

22:39.325 --> 22:41.160
Would you like
a refreshment?

22:41.193 --> 22:43.463
- Uh, I'm fine with water
right now, actually.

22:43.496 --> 22:45.231
- Me too.
- Shall I order a couple things

22:45.264 --> 22:46.433
and we'll split it?
- Yeah.

22:46.433 --> 22:48.034
- Raquel and I have
so much in common.

22:48.067 --> 22:50.236
We're gonna do
the rock shrimp, please.

22:50.269 --> 22:52.338
Um, we like to...

22:54.774 --> 22:56.008
Eat food.

22:56.042 --> 22:59.979
- I'm competing for Miss Malibu
in a few months.

23:00.012 --> 23:01.714
- Oh, my God,
that's already coming up?

23:01.748 --> 23:03.616
- Yeah, it's coming up fast,
so...

23:03.650 --> 23:05.652
- Wow.
- I have to start training

23:05.685 --> 23:07.286
and practicing walking.

23:07.319 --> 23:09.355
- Are you nervous?
- Not yet.

23:09.456 --> 23:10.557
I mean, it's so hard to walk

23:10.590 --> 23:13.325
in six-inch heels
and a bathing suit...

23:13.359 --> 23:14.694
- Okay.
- Onstage in front

23:14.727 --> 23:17.930
of so many people,
you know?

23:17.964 --> 23:19.466
- How do you walk?
How do you do that?

23:19.466 --> 23:21.300
Like, isn't it just walking?
- Well, for bathing suit,

23:21.333 --> 23:24.471
it's more of like a--
a peppier--

23:24.504 --> 23:26.973
Like, think Victoria's Secret
walk, you know?

23:27.006 --> 23:29.709
- You know, living in LA
when you're beautiful and young,

23:29.742 --> 23:31.778
you know,
there's really no excuse.

23:31.811 --> 23:33.312
If you're gonna have
a girlfriend,

23:33.345 --> 23:35.214
you know,
she's gonna have to be hot.

23:35.247 --> 23:37.283
Can I kiss you?
- Yeah.

23:37.316 --> 23:40.319
- [grunts]
- Of course, always.

23:40.352 --> 23:42.254
I love you.
- Love you.

23:42.288 --> 23:43.490
It's funny;
no matter, like,

23:43.490 --> 23:45.992
how many DJ gigs I get,
you know,

23:46.025 --> 23:48.260
they're all, like,
around these clubs

23:48.294 --> 23:50.730
and venues and lounges
around LA,

23:50.763 --> 23:52.599
and it's like,
I've been working for Lisa

23:52.632 --> 23:54.634
for three years,
and it's just been taken away.

23:54.667 --> 23:57.837
I took it away from myself,
and it f---ing breaks my heart.

23:57.870 --> 23:59.371
That's my fam.
It's, like, my family.

23:59.405 --> 24:00.507
- Yeah.
- It's been basically

24:00.540 --> 24:01.708
kind of hard for me
to realize

24:01.741 --> 24:03.776
what the next step is
in my music.

24:03.810 --> 24:07.079
- Did you get your job back
at Pump?

24:07.113 --> 24:09.181
- Not yet.
Not yet.

24:09.215 --> 24:10.950
You know, I think I'm gonna
see her tomorrow.

24:10.983 --> 24:13.152
I'm gonna come
with a more mature presence...

24:13.185 --> 24:14.554
- Yeah.
- And really explain to her,

24:14.587 --> 24:15.722
"Listen.

24:15.755 --> 24:19.526
"What can I do
to maybe get my job back?"

24:19.526 --> 24:21.528
At the end of the day,
I'm happier at Pump.

24:21.561 --> 24:22.962
I'm happier at Sur.

24:22.995 --> 24:24.531
- Oh, yeah, I can tell.

24:24.531 --> 24:27.534
You've been upset
the past few days.

24:27.534 --> 24:29.301
- Between, like,
my parents going through

24:29.335 --> 24:32.304
all the drama this year
and me getting fired from Sur,

24:32.338 --> 24:33.840
it's a lot to handle
at once for me.

24:33.873 --> 24:35.908
It's like my other mom is,
like, telling me

24:35.942 --> 24:37.577
that I'm not working for her
anymore.

24:37.610 --> 24:38.745
And I won't stop.

24:38.778 --> 24:41.313
I-I-I really don't know
if I could stop.

24:41.347 --> 24:44.250
- What else could you do?
- If she says no tomorrow,

24:44.283 --> 24:46.318
then I'll--you know
I'll be asking next month

24:46.352 --> 24:48.454
or the month after that.
- Oh, yeah.

24:48.555 --> 24:51.991
[electronic music]

24:52.024 --> 24:54.160
- Kingsley.
- Hi.

24:54.193 --> 24:55.695
- Hi.

24:55.728 --> 24:58.297
- [giggling]
- [exhales deeply]

24:59.298 --> 25:01.400
- Oh.
- [sighs]

25:01.568 --> 25:03.603
- My hurt boys.
- I need to sit down.

25:03.636 --> 25:05.237
- Just lay over here
on the couch

25:05.271 --> 25:07.740
and I'll get some pillows
behind you.

25:07.774 --> 25:09.075
How about that?

25:09.108 --> 25:11.811
Jax does not deal
with pain well whatsoever.

25:11.844 --> 25:13.012
If he cuts his hand,

25:13.045 --> 25:14.280
it's like the worst thing
in the world.

25:14.313 --> 25:16.115
Babe, are you hungry?
- I want to see it so bad.

25:16.148 --> 25:17.316
I want to see
what it looks like.

25:17.349 --> 25:18.818
- It's not gonna look right
for a while.

25:18.851 --> 25:23.590
He said that first it's gonna
be, like, concaved in...

25:23.623 --> 25:26.192
- What?
- Until the swelling goes down,

25:26.225 --> 25:27.594
and then it--
- Concave?

25:27.594 --> 25:29.128
- Yeah.
I got all your medicines here.

25:29.161 --> 25:30.597
- [groans]

25:30.597 --> 25:32.965
- You want a sandwich
and some soup?

25:32.999 --> 25:34.133
- Uh...
[exhales]

25:34.166 --> 25:35.401
I'll do a bowl of soup.

25:35.434 --> 25:38.605
- He's a little grumpy.
He's really needy.

25:38.605 --> 25:40.439
He's constantly asking me
for food.

25:40.472 --> 25:42.709
So pretty much,
he's exactly the same.

25:42.742 --> 25:44.811
[knock at door]
Who's here?

25:44.844 --> 25:46.112
- Hi, Kingsley.
- Watch out.

25:46.145 --> 25:48.247
Conehead's coming out.
- Hey, dude.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.316
all: Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

25:50.349 --> 25:51.751
- How you feeling?
You look pretty good

25:51.784 --> 25:52.752
compared to how
you usually look.

25:52.785 --> 25:54.120
- Yeah, dude.
- [laughs]

25:54.153 --> 25:55.855
- Dude, it's become routine
for us to comfort you

25:55.888 --> 25:58.090
after jail and after surgery.

25:58.124 --> 26:00.660
Whoa, doughnuts.

26:00.693 --> 26:02.261
[gasps]
Is that blood, dude?

26:02.294 --> 26:03.630
both: No, it's jelly.

26:03.630 --> 26:05.632
- It's a jelly doughnut.
- What?

26:05.665 --> 26:06.999
I'm like,
"Do I get a punch card?"

26:07.033 --> 26:08.167
Like, ser--
- Yeah.

26:08.200 --> 26:09.501
Hey, by the way,
they're gonna look great,

26:09.535 --> 26:11.403
and me and Tom thought
it would be nice to get you--

26:11.437 --> 26:12.705
- Dude.
- You can fill it out.

26:12.739 --> 26:14.173
You're finally gonna look good
in this, dude.

26:14.206 --> 26:15.441
- Yes.
- Yeah.

26:15.474 --> 26:17.143
- Not gonna have those droopy
man boobs anymore.

26:17.176 --> 26:19.511
- I know.
Did you say "droopy man boobs"?

26:19.545 --> 26:20.713
- He did.
- Oh, my gosh.

26:20.747 --> 26:23.650
- Why's it so small?
- This is hilarious.

26:23.650 --> 26:25.184
Oh, my gosh.

26:25.217 --> 26:26.853
- This is awesome.

26:26.886 --> 26:28.755
This is for Brittany.
- Oh, yeah, that's...

26:28.788 --> 26:30.990
- Oh, no.
- That's great.

26:31.023 --> 26:32.358
No, do not get Jax that.

26:32.391 --> 26:35.161
We got Jax the service bell
as kind of a joke...

26:35.194 --> 26:36.162
[bell dinging]

26:36.195 --> 26:37.163
But I feel like

26:37.196 --> 26:38.397
he's gonna utilize that thing,

26:38.430 --> 26:41.100
having Brittany wait on him
hand and feet.

26:41.133 --> 26:43.069
[all laugh]

26:43.102 --> 26:44.236
- There you go.
- What is this?

26:44.270 --> 26:46.038
- Ooh, look at that shirt.
It's nice.

26:46.072 --> 26:47.940
It's got the bra built in it.
- [laughing]

26:47.974 --> 26:49.842
- You can be in style
and be supported

26:49.876 --> 26:51.543
at the same time, you know?

26:51.577 --> 26:53.112
- You're one of the rare couples

26:53.145 --> 26:55.581
that have both had
breast augmentation.

26:55.682 --> 26:57.316
Male/female couples.
- Yeah.

26:57.349 --> 26:59.551
That's really cute.
- That's a rare combo, dude.

26:59.585 --> 27:00.987
- Hey, you guys ready
for Sonoma?

27:01.020 --> 27:03.055
- Are you gonna be able to--
- As of right now,

27:03.089 --> 27:04.590
I-I feel good.
I feel fine.

27:04.691 --> 27:06.292
I should be fine by Saturday.

27:06.325 --> 27:07.593
I mean, I'm obviously
not gonna be,

27:07.694 --> 27:09.796
like, going crazy,
but I'm gonna go.

27:09.829 --> 27:11.197
- You're definitely
gonna be going crazy.

27:11.230 --> 27:12.699
- Is Scheana still going
on the trip

27:12.732 --> 27:13.866
with the girls and everything?

27:13.900 --> 27:15.167
- I have no idea
what's going on.

27:15.201 --> 27:16.468
- Is Katie still livid
with her or no?

27:16.502 --> 27:18.170
- I've stayed clear of that one
for reasons--

27:18.204 --> 27:20.072
'Cause I'm trying
to keep Katie calm

27:20.106 --> 27:21.440
for the wedding,
you know?

27:21.473 --> 27:23.175
I don't want to get her
riled up.

27:23.209 --> 27:24.543
- Let's give her some tequila.

27:24.576 --> 27:26.178
- Well, she's good now
with that.

- Oh...
- Till she's not.

27:29.548 --> 27:31.417
[all chuckle]
Till she's not.

27:31.450 --> 27:32.719
- Coming up...

27:32.719 --> 27:35.154
- Stay out of what's
other people's business.

27:35.187 --> 27:36.588
It's not your business.
That's your problem.

27:36.622 --> 27:37.757
You get into
other people's business.

27:37.790 --> 27:38.925
- Don't tell me
that's my problem.

Hi.
- Hi.

27:54.741 --> 27:56.976
- Look at your haircut.
- Hi, Luda.

- Yeah.

- Wait.
I love this.

This is cute.

11-year-old brother.

28:03.950 --> 28:05.952
He's in fifth grade.

28:05.985 --> 28:08.755
He's actually the sibling
I'm most closest to.

be shy of girls.

Not like a wolf or snake.

You just have to listen
to that advice.

I'm gonna take it to heart.

I had to buy a fan.

he was just murdered

29:23.362 --> 29:25.331
because of the way
that he had to shut it off,

29:25.364 --> 29:26.966
which I'm okay with.
- She's pretty.

and go into my room.

29:48.855 --> 29:51.323
like, how many days
it's really gonna last

29:51.357 --> 29:53.392
because I know that
everybody makes fun of me now

29:53.425 --> 29:55.127
when I say that we broke up.

29:55.161 --> 29:57.063
- It's kind of normal
for you and Patrick.

29:57.096 --> 29:59.598
You know,
for the last two years...

29:59.631 --> 30:01.300
- I know.
- This has become a pattern.

30:01.333 --> 30:02.801
- If there's not,
like, a major move

30:02.835 --> 30:06.272
to, like, come and win me back
or something,

30:06.305 --> 30:09.976
like, I'm going to Montauk,
and if a dude comes up to me,

30:10.009 --> 30:11.210
I will entertain it.
- Yeah.

30:11.243 --> 30:12.611
- I'm not gonna be like, "Bye."

about Patrick and I

30:14.613 --> 30:16.282

but this time feels very serious
and very real.

in a fight with all of us.

[quietly]
Ouch.

30:36.035 --> 30:41.840
*

30:41.874 --> 30:44.110
Hi, how are you?
- Hi, how are you?

30:44.143 --> 30:46.412
- Um, can we get two,
uh, gel pedicures?

30:46.445 --> 30:48.547
And then, um, I just need
a polish change.

30:48.580 --> 30:49.648
- Sure.

30:49.681 --> 30:53.119
[upbeat music]

30:53.152 --> 30:55.687
- It's so hot.
- I know.

30:55.721 --> 30:58.457
- If it's 100 here,
it's, like, 110 at my house.

30:58.490 --> 31:00.059
- Yeah, but you have
air-conditioning.

31:00.092 --> 31:01.593
- I know, I do, yeah.
- I do not.

31:01.627 --> 31:04.063
Why there got to be
so many options?

31:04.096 --> 31:06.132
- I'm gonna do this one.

31:06.165 --> 31:07.299
You said that's a gel, right?

31:07.333 --> 31:08.467
- Yeah, gel.
- Okay.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.502
- I've never had gloves
like this.

31:10.536 --> 31:11.737
- I know. What's--
I don't understand.

31:11.770 --> 31:13.639
- I don't know.
- Like, very--okay.

31:13.672 --> 31:15.674
- Protect my hands?

31:15.707 --> 31:18.210
I'm tired.
- It's been a long couple days.

31:18.244 --> 31:19.578
*

31:19.611 --> 31:21.413
Have you talked
to Stassi or Katie

31:21.447 --> 31:22.781
in the last couple days?

31:22.814 --> 31:24.283
No?

31:24.316 --> 31:26.685
Not since the party?

31:26.718 --> 31:29.155
- I, like, woke up Saturday,
and I'm like...

31:29.188 --> 31:30.789
- Yeah.
- "Damn it.

31:30.822 --> 31:32.324
I wish that was just
a bad dream."

31:32.358 --> 31:33.625
- I know.
- And I could have woke up

31:33.659 --> 31:35.061
and been like,
"Oh, everything's fine."

31:35.094 --> 31:36.562
No.
- I was downstairs

31:36.595 --> 31:39.365
when Stassi came
running down crying

31:39.398 --> 31:40.967
and locked herself
in the bathroom.

31:40.967 --> 31:43.335
- What was she crying over?

31:43.369 --> 31:45.704
- She just came in
and she was screaming

31:45.737 --> 31:47.974
and she just, like--
"I fricking hate

31:47.974 --> 31:49.675
Scheana and Ariana right now."

31:49.708 --> 31:52.811
- I just don't know
how things get...

31:52.844 --> 31:54.746
so blown out of proportion.

31:54.780 --> 31:56.748
- You don't think

31:56.782 --> 31:59.085
in any way Katie's so mad

31:59.118 --> 32:01.687
that she would kick you out
from being a bridesmaid?

32:01.720 --> 32:04.090
- Um, I mean,
I would certainly hope not.

32:04.123 --> 32:07.659
- No, it's--
Don't stay mad.

32:07.693 --> 32:09.361
- Am I gonna be disinvited?

32:09.395 --> 32:11.830
Is Katie gonna demote me
from the bridal party?

32:11.863 --> 32:13.832
Like, I just don't even
know where I stand

32:13.865 --> 32:16.635
with my friends right now,
and it's giving me anxiety.

32:16.668 --> 32:19.038
- You guys are going to Montauk
this weekend, right?

32:19.071 --> 32:21.773
- I'm clearly not allowed
to go to Sonoma,

32:21.807 --> 32:23.342
so do I have a choice?

32:23.375 --> 32:25.911
- Okay, we've already
gotten NASCAR tickets.

32:26.012 --> 32:27.479
- We already had to get passes,

32:27.513 --> 32:29.481
and to get passes,
we had to give names.

32:29.515 --> 32:31.283
- Like, you can't come with us.

32:31.317 --> 32:33.485
- So I need to fix this.
- Right, and you do,

32:33.519 --> 32:36.022
and you will,
but just fix it soon.

32:36.055 --> 32:37.789
You'll be the peacemaker
this week.

32:37.823 --> 32:39.658
You're gonna go and you're
gonna have a good time.

32:39.691 --> 32:42.728
You'll still be a bridesmaid.

32:42.761 --> 32:45.031
We hope.
[chuckles]

32:45.031 --> 32:52.038
*

32:52.038 --> 32:54.406
- Nikolai?
- What?

32:54.440 --> 32:56.742
- Come here.
I need to ask you advice.

32:56.775 --> 32:59.145
*

32:59.178 --> 33:01.480
- Did you start the fight?
Did you--did you start it?

33:01.513 --> 33:03.149
- I don't remember
who started the--

33:03.182 --> 33:05.051
- It's beer.
It's just beer.

33:05.084 --> 33:06.952
Did you guys go a bar
to that night?

33:07.053 --> 33:09.421
- Well, we drank,
but we didn't go to a bar.

33:09.455 --> 33:11.923
Like, we were partying--
- How much did you drink?

33:11.957 --> 33:14.093
A lot?
- That's not fair.

33:14.126 --> 33:16.895
Scheana said stuff to Katie
that was really mean.

33:16.928 --> 33:19.065
Things that, like, you just
don't say to your friend.

33:19.065 --> 33:20.732
If you're best friends,
we don't do that.

33:20.766 --> 33:22.168
We want to support each other,

33:22.201 --> 33:24.203
and so I was very upset
about all of this,

33:24.236 --> 33:26.738
and then I heard that Scheana
was saying things that were--

33:26.772 --> 33:29.241
- Stay out of what's
other people's business.

33:29.275 --> 33:30.676
It's not your business.
That's your problem.

33:30.709 --> 33:31.843
You get into
other people's business.

33:31.877 --> 33:32.944
- Don't tell me
that's my problem.

33:32.978 --> 33:34.113
That I get into--
- That is your problem!

33:34.146 --> 33:35.547
- Sometimes people don't know

33:35.581 --> 33:37.083
when they should apologize,

33:37.116 --> 33:38.917
so I need to tell Scheana

33:38.950 --> 33:42.088
that she did something wrong
and she needs to apologize.

33:42.088 --> 33:45.557
- She needs to figure
that herself.

33:45.591 --> 33:47.126
You're not the boss.

33:47.159 --> 33:48.360
You're not
the boss.

33:48.394 --> 33:49.861
- Yes, I am.

33:49.895 --> 33:51.197
- No, you're not.
- What are you even saying?

33:51.230 --> 33:54.433
Okay, fine,
Nikolai gives great advice,

33:54.466 --> 33:56.335
but he's, like, 11,
so I'm--

33:56.368 --> 33:58.570
I'm not gonna listen to him.

33:58.604 --> 34:02.108
- If you be bossy
and it's always your way,

34:02.108 --> 34:04.143
people are not gonna like that.

34:04.176 --> 34:06.312
- F--- that.
- Okay?

34:06.345 --> 34:07.313
- Coming up...

34:07.346 --> 34:08.814
- Ready to go.
- Yeah?

34:08.847 --> 34:10.116
- All the ducks are in a row.

34:10.116 --> 34:12.118
- So we're all
on the same flight?

- Hey, look at you.

34:27.966 --> 34:29.301
- Hi.
Thanks.

34:29.335 --> 34:31.670
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

34:33.672 --> 34:35.341
- Today is Ariana's birthday.

34:35.374 --> 34:37.443
Last year,
Ariana wanted one thing,

34:37.476 --> 34:38.677
and that was for me

34:38.710 --> 34:41.147
not to go to Vegas
and drive bulldozers.

34:41.180 --> 34:43.949
Apparently he told me that we're
going to a construction yard

34:43.982 --> 34:45.551
and we're taking bulldozers

34:45.584 --> 34:48.154
and, like, crushing sh--
with bulldozers.

34:48.154 --> 34:49.888
[soft dramatic music]

34:49.921 --> 34:52.258
This year,
I've organized the best trip

34:52.291 --> 34:54.860
a girl from Florida
could ever wish for...

34:54.893 --> 34:57.263
Oh, socks from last time.
Sweet.

34:57.296 --> 34:59.898
And that is NASCAR

34:59.931 --> 35:01.267

35:10.309 --> 35:11.610
- Hey.
both: Hello.

35:11.643 --> 35:12.878
- What's up?
- What's up, guys?

35:12.911 --> 35:14.045
- How are you guys?

35:14.079 --> 35:16.047
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you.

35:16.081 --> 35:17.616
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

35:17.649 --> 35:20.552
- Okay, we had, like,
a really cute balloon,

35:20.586 --> 35:22.221
and it blew away.
- What's up, dude?

35:22.254 --> 35:23.389
- [laughs]
- I felt so bad.

35:23.422 --> 35:24.890
I was like, "This is so lame."

35:24.923 --> 35:26.358
Like, "Here's a box of tequila."

35:26.392 --> 35:28.660
- I like it.
Thank you.

35:28.694 --> 35:30.629
- Can you guys believe
that we leave tomorrow?

35:30.662 --> 35:32.598
- You know, I didn't want
to have the kind of birthday

35:32.631 --> 35:34.200
where I was having
to get dressed up

35:34.233 --> 35:36.335
and doing makeup all the time
and wondering, like,

35:36.368 --> 35:39.538
"Am I cute enough?
Am I wearing the right outfit?"

35:39.571 --> 35:41.873
And--I mean, in short,
I didn't want to be in Montauk.

35:41.907 --> 35:44.776
- I won't be there.
I'm missing out.

35:44.810 --> 35:47.045
You guys are gonna have
so much fun, though.

35:47.078 --> 35:48.480
- This is the second year
in a row

35:48.514 --> 35:50.216
that I haven't been invited
to Ariana's birthday,

35:50.216 --> 35:52.050
and last year,
I kind of get it.

35:52.083 --> 35:53.219
We weren't as close.

35:53.219 --> 35:54.720
But this year, I feel like

35:54.753 --> 35:56.855
everybody else
wants me there except Jax,

35:56.888 --> 35:59.124
and it--that little bitch
is getting his way again.

35:59.225 --> 36:01.693
- Everything is all

36:01.727 --> 36:02.928
ready to go.

36:02.961 --> 36:04.896
- Yeah?
- All the ducks are in a row.

36:04.930 --> 36:08.667
- Has Jax had, like, an issue
with me coming to your birthday?

36:08.700 --> 36:10.569
- No, not that I know of.

36:10.602 --> 36:12.471
Jax sometimes says things some--

36:12.504 --> 36:14.340
that no one should
pay attention to.

36:14.373 --> 36:15.741
- Well, Jax has said
a lot of things.

36:15.774 --> 36:18.043
- Are you crazy?
Are you delusional?

36:18.076 --> 36:19.044
Okay, nobody wants
to be your friend.

36:19.077 --> 36:20.246
Grow up.

36:20.246 --> 36:21.447
You're nobody.
You're nobody.

36:21.480 --> 36:22.614
- If I'm nobody--
- Go sling some more d---

36:22.648 --> 36:24.082

yeah.

36:24.115 --> 36:25.417
You're f---ing an old man

36:25.451 --> 36:27.152
who's married and has kids!

36:27.253 --> 36:30.456
- You guys just know how his,
like, bullying ways work.

36:30.489 --> 36:33.792
- I've seen the way these people
have treated each other.

36:33.825 --> 36:35.294
They're best friends one day,

36:35.327 --> 36:37.729
and they want to kill each other
the next.

36:37.763 --> 36:39.465
- I won't be there to, like,

36:39.498 --> 36:41.267
f---ing snap back
at him either,

36:41.267 --> 36:42.901
so he'll--he'll be able to talk
all the sh-- he wants.

36:42.934 --> 36:45.304
- Yeah, but nobody really
is gonna want to hear that.

36:45.337 --> 36:47.739

How are you?

- Uh, yeah, she's in the VIP.

37:09.961 --> 37:11.096
I think so.
- All right, cool.

I'm gonna go say hello to her.

I'm fine.

37:28.314 --> 37:29.648
I'm busy.
- I know.

37:29.681 --> 37:32.684
I just wanted to come in
and, you know, um...

37:32.718 --> 37:34.386
- What is there to talk about?

37:34.420 --> 37:37.323
- I just wanted to say,
I miss working for you.

37:37.323 --> 37:39.525
You know, I really love
you and Ken so much.

37:39.558 --> 37:41.893

what I had for granted,

I don't want you

37:46.698 --> 37:48.334

37:48.367 --> 37:51.069

Sorry.

37:51.102 --> 37:52.938
- That's disrespectful.
- You're right.

37:52.971 --> 37:55.574

did you a favor.

37:55.607 --> 37:57.343
- I don't think so.

37:57.343 --> 37:59.678
Lisa should hire me back
not only because

37:59.711 --> 38:01.880
I've been better
at being sober and stuff,

38:01.913 --> 38:04.182
but, quite frankly, I'm the best
DJ she's had at Sur.

I know the talent I have.

into becoming the expert

what you think.

I'm telling you.

to reality.

you were an arrogant
little punk.

38:19.998 --> 38:20.966
And look at me.

38:20.999 --> 38:22.200
do I look like somebody

38:22.233 --> 38:24.370
that employs
an arrogant little punk?

38:24.403 --> 38:27.005
- No, but you have done
in the past with Jax.

38:27.038 --> 38:30.141
*

38:30.175 --> 38:33.979
- I'm not saying Jax displays
exemplary behavior,

38:34.012 --> 38:37.115
but in his workplace,
he's never been disrespectful.

38:37.148 --> 38:39.985
- That's a lie.

38:40.018 --> 38:42.287
That's no--that's not true.
- So you're calling me a liar?

38:42.388 --> 38:43.689
- No, but that's not true
about Jax.

38:43.722 --> 38:44.923
- So you come in here
and you use the F-bomb

38:44.956 --> 38:46.525
and you call me a liar
and you expect me

38:46.558 --> 38:47.793
to give you the time of day?
- Lisa, I was not trying

38:47.826 --> 38:49.094
to do that, okay?
I just wanted--

38:49.127 --> 38:50.396
- I'm saying
he's not disrespectful to me.

38:50.396 --> 38:51.797
You have been disrespectful
to me.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.432
You can't stop yourself.

38:53.465 --> 38:56.267
My life is actually better
without you in it.

38:56.301 --> 38:58.837
I'm being honest.
It's less problematic.

38:58.870 --> 39:01.139
- I just want you to know
that I'm not drinking right now

39:01.172 --> 39:02.808
and that I've been
hanging out with Max,

39:02.841 --> 39:04.510
and he's seen
a small difference in me

39:04.543 --> 39:05.744
since we've been hanging
for this week...

39:05.777 --> 39:07.312
- But a week is nothing.

39:07.413 --> 39:09.715
A week in--in the big picture
is nothing.

39:09.748 --> 39:10.916
- I don't want to do it anymore.

39:10.949 --> 39:12.283
- [sighs]
- It's already really ruined

39:12.317 --> 39:13.952
a lot of opportunities
for me already.

39:13.985 --> 39:15.754
I'm still DJ'ing, thank God,
and still doing things.

39:15.787 --> 39:17.022
I miss it at Sur.
I miss you very much.

39:17.055 --> 39:19.625
- Maybe you should do
another job.

39:19.658 --> 39:21.493
You should choose
another career path

39:21.527 --> 39:22.661
apart from DJ'ing.

39:22.694 --> 39:24.295
- Has she lost her mind?

39:24.329 --> 39:25.764
I mean, it's not like
you could picture me

39:25.797 --> 39:27.298
in the middle of a cubicle
9:00 to 5:00

39:27.332 --> 39:29.067
selling f---ing insurance.

39:29.100 --> 39:31.770
"Hi, hi, this is,
uh, James Kennedy.

39:31.803 --> 39:33.705
I'm trying to se--"
Beep.

39:33.739 --> 39:37.042
Nah.
It's DJ James Kennedy.

39:37.075 --> 39:39.110
- Time is money, James.
- I apologize.

39:39.144 --> 39:40.712
I don't want to keep you
any longer.

39:40.746 --> 39:42.247
- And I have enough money,
but I don't have enough time.

39:42.280 --> 39:45.116
So are we done?
- Yeah.

39:45.150 --> 39:47.486
All right, thank you.
Have a lovely day, okay?

39:47.519 --> 39:49.220
- There's a great moral
to this story,

39:49.254 --> 39:50.722
and it's the oldest thing
in the world.

39:50.756 --> 39:53.759
You don't know what you had
until it's gone.

39:53.792 --> 39:55.461
Ain't that the truth?

39:55.461 --> 39:56.995
James is gone.

39:57.028 --> 39:57.996
- * Go, go, go, go

39:58.029 --> 39:59.297
[pop music]

39:59.330 --> 40:00.466
* Go
- All righty.

40:00.499 --> 40:01.967
- * Never ever let go

40:02.000 --> 40:04.035
- * Go, go, go, go

40:04.069 --> 40:06.705
* Go
- * Never ever let go

40:06.738 --> 40:08.807
- * Go, go, go, go
- * Go, go, go

40:08.840 --> 40:11.276
both: * Go
- * Never ever let go

40:11.309 --> 40:14.012
- * Go, go, go, go
- * Go, go, go, go

40:14.045 --> 40:18.283
both: * Never ever let me go
- * Go, go, go, go

40:18.316 --> 40:19.284
- Coming up...

40:19.317 --> 40:20.786
- Where's Lala?

40:20.819 --> 40:22.287
- Nobody knows.

40:22.320 --> 40:23.722
What is she gonna do?

40:30.161 --> 40:30.496
[pop music]

40:33.765 --> 40:36.735
- * Let's ri-i-i-i-i-ide

40:36.768 --> 40:41.172
* Livin' that li-i-i-i-i-ife

40:41.206 --> 40:44.209
* Let's ri-i-i-i-i-ide

40:44.242 --> 40:47.879
* Livin' that li-i-i-i-i-ife

40:47.913 --> 40:49.681
*

40:49.715 --> 40:52.017
- I'm really excited
about this trip.

40:52.050 --> 40:53.819
We're flying up
to San Francisco

40:53.852 --> 40:55.921
and then
to mother----ing NASCAR.

40:55.954 --> 40:57.055
It's gonna be badass.

40:57.088 --> 40:58.790
- Some cheese, some lettuce,
and bread.

40:58.824 --> 41:00.225
It's all you need in life.

41:00.258 --> 41:02.961
- It's Ariana's birthday trip.
Let's do this.

41:02.994 --> 41:05.797
Where's Lala?

41:05.831 --> 41:08.199
- Nobody knows.
- You know?

41:08.233 --> 41:10.736
- No, I don't.
I texted her.

41:10.769 --> 41:13.872
- I texted her too.
I told her to get her ass here.

41:13.905 --> 41:17.175
- I said, "Where you at,
question mark,

41:17.208 --> 41:18.844
exclamation point."

41:18.877 --> 41:20.445
- Yeah.

41:20.546 --> 41:21.980
- What is she gonna do?

41:22.013 --> 41:23.715
- I don't know.

41:23.749 --> 41:24.783
That's messed up,

41:24.816 --> 41:25.884
because we could have gotten

41:25.917 --> 41:27.719
somebody else
to fill her spot.

41:27.753 --> 41:31.690
- This is a super early flight,
but part of me feels like,

41:31.723 --> 41:33.992
"Is she standing us up?"

41:34.025 --> 41:36.461
- Where's Lala?
- She's not here.

41:36.562 --> 41:38.163
- She'll probably
show up last second.

41:38.196 --> 41:39.164
[dramatic music]

41:39.197 --> 41:42.568
- Fire device.
- [laughs]

41:42.568 --> 41:45.036
[line ringing]

41:45.070 --> 41:46.905
- The terminal gate areas
are limited

41:46.938 --> 41:48.874
to ticketed passengers only

41:48.907 --> 41:52.410
or those authorized adults
escorting unaccompanied minors.

41:52.443 --> 41:53.411
*

41:53.444 --> 41:55.413
[bell chimes]

41:55.446 --> 41:56.915
- All set.
[scanner beeps]

41:56.948 --> 41:59.918
*

41:59.951 --> 42:02.353
- I want to make it
the best birthday ever

42:02.387 --> 42:03.589
for Ariana,

42:03.622 --> 42:06.291
and if anybody
stands in the way of that,

42:06.324 --> 42:07.726
I'm gonna be pissed.

42:07.759 --> 42:09.094
And right now,
I'm asking myself,

42:09.127 --> 42:10.729
"Where the f--- is Lala?"

42:10.762 --> 42:12.330
*

42:12.363 --> 42:15.366
[jet engine whirring]

42:17.502 --> 42:19.437
- Next time
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

42:19.470 --> 42:21.339
- Welcome to Montauk!
[all giggling]

42:21.372 --> 42:23.274
- Welcome to the Sonoma Express!

42:23.308 --> 42:25.076
- Whoo!

42:25.110 --> 42:26.311
- Everything's
finally going right,

42:26.344 --> 42:28.113
but, oh, what do I do?
I got to f--- this up somehow

42:28.146 --> 42:30.248
because that's what Jax does.
- I need to have sex.

42:30.281 --> 42:31.449
I want to have sex.

42:31.482 --> 42:32.951
- Have you heard from Lala
at all?

42:32.984 --> 42:34.853
- The only thing
I can think of is that

42:34.886 --> 42:38.223
she's completely wrapped
around this guy's finger.

42:38.256 --> 42:39.758
- Let this not be,
like, one of those trips

42:39.791 --> 42:40.992
where's she's just like,

42:41.026 --> 42:42.961
"Well, I don't want to do,
like, certain things."

42:42.994 --> 42:44.462
Well, we're doing
green tea shots.

42:44.495 --> 42:47.165
- One of those,
I will be hungover.

42:47.198 --> 42:48.499
- You don't even have
a boyfriend,

42:48.533 --> 42:49.901
so shut the f--- up,
birthday girl.

42:49.935 --> 42:51.870
- Jesus Christ.
- [laughs]

42:51.903 --> 42:54.640
- Are you crying?

42:54.640 --> 42:56.107
- To see more
of "Vanderpump Rules,"

42:56.141 --> 42:57.643
go to bravotv.com.
