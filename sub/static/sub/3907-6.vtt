right off a pair of tits.

a fucking camera at you.

Why Angie would do this?

Give it a shot for a second. Why do you think?
Maybe the fucking money?

07:59.897 --> 08:00.977
There's that.

08:01.357 --> 08:03.689
But word on the street is, you know Angela.

Wait, wait, wait,
you saying you know Angela?

08:13.577 --> 08:15.909
No, Vernon, they're acquaintances, that's all.

08:15.996 --> 08:16.985
-That's fucked up.
-SPENCER: Vernon, listen.

08:17.081 --> 08:19.493
Just because I know her, it has nothing
to do with her coming after you.

08:19.583 --> 08:21.289
-Are you sure about that?
-I'm positive.

08:21.502 --> 08:24.710
I gathered us all here to make sure
everybody's on the same level.

08:24.797 --> 08:26.412
You better be straight up with us from now on

08:26.507 --> 08:27.747
or we might have to make a change.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.964
The fact that I know Angie doesn't mean shit.

08:30.052 --> 08:32.714
You're the one doing coke.
Don't try and pin this bullshit on me, Reg.

08:32.805 --> 08:36.093
Why not?
You said Jason handles the contracts.

08:36.350 --> 08:39.558
Joe handles the money,
and you handle everything else in between.

08:39.770 --> 08:42.807

I shelled out over the years

19:13.361 --> 19:16.194
Your wife blew through the front gate.
She's coming in the house.

19:16.281 --> 19:17.270
What?

19:22.620 --> 19:23.609
(TIRES SQUEAL)

19:26.916 --> 19:28.076
(TIRES SCREECH)

19:32.547 --> 19:33.536
(JULIE CALLING OUT)

19:33.631 --> 19:35.292
Gotta get the fuck up out Of here.

19:40.597 --> 19:41.757
JULIE: Charles!

19:44.184 --> 19:45.640
I know your ass is here.

19:52.901 --> 19:54.016
Charles!

19:56.488 --> 19:57.728
Charles!

20:00.867 --> 20:02.107
Charles!

20:04.788 --> 20:05.994
Charles!

20:06.456 --> 20:08.117
What the fuck are you doing?

20:10.543 --> 20:11.703
Hey.

20:12.962 --> 20:14.543
I'm sorry, baby.

20:15.590 --> 20:17.205
Ijust want to come home. This ain't me.

20:17.300 --> 20:19.632
I swear to God,
I don't even know who you are anymore.

20:20.720 --> 20:21.880
Neither do I.

20:21.971 --> 20:24.838
They got some people in there
smoking weed all day.

20:24.933 --> 20:27.390
-Weed?
-They got this nasty freak room.

20:27.477 --> 20:29.638
-Girls playing with themselves and...
-What?

20:29.729 --> 20:32.471
Yeah. Ijust want to come home, baby.

20:32.607 --> 20:33.972
Can I come home, please?

20:34.067 --> 20:35.432
This nasty.

20:36.653 --> 20:39.190
-Please?
-Yes. Baby, come on.

20:39.406 --> 20:41.442
-Yeah?
-JULIE: Yes. Come down.

20:41.533 --> 20:42.739
-Yeah?
-JUL|E: Come to Mama, baby.

20:42.992 --> 20:44.528
I'll take care Of you, baby. Come on.

20:44.619 --> 20:46.985
Oh, baby, I love you. Mmm.

20:48.081 --> 20:49.446
Mmm, I love you.

20:52.210 --> 20:54.292
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

20:54.504 --> 20:56.290
Damn right your ass is sorry.

21:02.345 --> 21:05.007
It's about time you get back
to who you really are.

21:08.810 --> 21:10.175
Oh, my God!

21:11.146 --> 21:12.556
I'm in the love pond.

21:13.022 --> 21:15.434
Oh, shit! Oh, it got in my mouth.

21:16.109 --> 21:19.021
JAY: All right, Ricky, we have a new season.
With that, you have a new team.

21:19.154 --> 21:21.486
Just finished up OTAs,
so it's really the first time

21:24.659 --> 21:27.492
-How'd you fit in?
-Like a glove, man.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.535
It's beautiful out there. A lot of love.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.328
-All good, man.
-A lot of love?

21:31.416 --> 21:32.997
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

21:33.084 --> 21:34.949
Okay, if it's all love, I'm gonna ask you this...

21:35.044 --> 21:37.080
Excuse me, Jay, but I need to
get something Off my chest.

21:38.548 --> 21:40.038
-The floor is yours.
-Thank you, sir.

21:40.133 --> 21:42.624
If we had snipers on the roof,
now would be a good time to take the shot.

21:42.719 --> 21:44.801
I want to sincerely apologize for the trouble

21:44.888 --> 21:49.678
this very brief encounter with, uh,
Miss Cooley caused the fans.

21:49.893 --> 21:53.806
I want to apologize to Mr. Ross,
the entire organization,

21:54.230 --> 21:57.688
you know, uh, my teammates,
and most importantly Alonzo.

21:57.901 --> 22:00.893
I had no idea she was...

22:01.779 --> 22:03.280
-You know, they were family.
-Ah, ah.

22:03.781 --> 22:05.157
-I'm gonna stop you right there.
-Okay.

22:05.241 --> 22:06.617
You've been in this league long
enough to know

22:06.701 --> 22:09.864
that there's only a couple Of things that are
truly taboo inside a locker room, right?

22:09.954 --> 22:11.490
-Yeah.
-Okay, that one right there,

22:11.581 --> 22:13.196
that one tops the list.

22:13.291 --> 22:15.498
Well, yeah, I... Listen, I love my mom,

22:15.585 --> 22:16.916
I love my moms.

22:17.003 --> 22:19.210
And if I ever found myself
in Alonzo's position,

22:19.297 --> 22:20.787
I'd have a big problem with it, too.

22:20.882 --> 22:22.042
(LAUGHS) Believe me.

22:22.425 --> 22:24.962
But Alonzo, to his credit, he stood up.

22:25.136 --> 22:26.512
SO Alonzo had to step up?

22:26.596 --> 22:28.837
Approached me like a man and
we were able to work it out.

22:28.932 --> 22:30.547
We worked it out like grown-ups.

22:30.934 --> 22:32.140
How are you guys now?

22:32.560 --> 22:33.936
Outstanding. Great.

22:34.103 --> 22:35.183
Brothers-in-arms, man.

22:35.271 --> 22:37.353
You tried to buy Alonzo's number,

22:37.440 --> 22:39.431
the number 18, from him, right? Why?

22:39.734 --> 22:43.693
Well, you know, Iwore it in high school
and that was my number in college as well.

22:43.780 --> 22:46.271
JAY: Nobody Offers somebody $40,000

22:46.366 --> 22:48.357
just for a number that
you wore in high school and college.

22:48.451 --> 22:50.942
-What's the story?
-I don't know. It's just a number.

22:51.037 --> 22:53.870
That's more than most people
make in a year in this country, right?

22:53.957 --> 22:55.447
What does that number mean to you?

23:00.213 --> 23:02.955
-You want to cut to the chase?
-It is the only reason I am here.

23:03.049 --> 23:04.414
Well, let's cut to the chase, Jay.

23:04.509 --> 23:06.249
All right, well, this ain't about the number 18.

23:06.344 --> 23:07.800
This about the number 81.

23:08.346 --> 23:10.177
Number 81? How are we on 81?

23:10.390 --> 23:11.971
My father played pro ball.

23:12.559 --> 23:15.096
-He did for about nine years.
-Wait, wait, wait.

23:15.311 --> 23:18.474
All this time you've played,
we've covered you,

23:18.565 --> 23:21.557
this is the first time we're ever hearing
you had a dad who played in the league?

23:21.651 --> 23:23.858
He took Off on me and my mom
before I was born.

23:24.028 --> 23:25.689
Doesn't make me a special case, though.

23:25.780 --> 23:28.613
Most guys I know, shoot,
they come from single-parent homes.

23:28.992 --> 23:31.278
But I used to watch him every Sunday on TV.

23:31.369 --> 23:34.281
And emulate his style,
I wanted to be like my father.

23:35.081 --> 23:38.039
Until I got Old enough to understand
what he had done, and then I got angry.

23:38.126 --> 23:40.162
Have you ever tried to reach out to him?

23:40.336 --> 23:41.416
Reach out?

23:41.921 --> 23:43.661
(SCOFFS) Did many a times.

23:43.756 --> 23:46.042
He never once accepted a call,

23:46.134 --> 23:48.170
a letter, an email.

23:48.261 --> 23:49.501
Nothing.

23:49.762 --> 23:51.627
(SCOFFS) He chose not to know me.

23:51.723 --> 23:53.759
He chose not to know me
when I won a state title.

23:53.850 --> 23:55.841
He chose not to know me
when I won a national title.

23:56.019 --> 23:58.385
He chose not to know me when I got drafted.

23:59.522 --> 24:01.604
He wanted nothing to do with me
after all Of that.

24:01.691 --> 24:03.647
He wanted nothing to do with me.

24:05.570 --> 24:06.685
SO this number...

24:08.239 --> 24:09.354
You see it?

24:11.701 --> 24:12.907
This number.

24:13.328 --> 24:16.115
This number represents the man I am
on and Off the field.

24:17.457 --> 24:19.664
My dad wore 81.

24:19.751 --> 24:21.912
SO I took the number 18 to flip the script.

24:22.378 --> 24:24.243
I swore a long time ago

24:24.422 --> 24:26.959
I'd never take the field wearing a jersey
that didn't say anything

24:27.050 --> 24:30.087
but, "Fuck you, Dad", on the front and back.

24:32.722 --> 24:34.053
We are nothing alike.

24:39.312 --> 24:41.348
Ricky motherfucking Jerret.

24:41.731 --> 24:43.312
JAY: You good?
RICKY: I'm great.

24:43.399 --> 24:45.731
-Was I fair?
-You were and I killed it, so you...

24:46.569 --> 24:48.105
You guys know about the dad?

24:48.321 --> 24:49.811
That I wasn't expecting.

24:49.906 --> 24:51.396
Outstanding. You looked like a movie star.

24:51.491 --> 24:53.573
-SO proud Of you.
-Just me being me, baby.

24:53.660 --> 24:55.696
Up next, Live with Kelly and Ricky. Come on.

24:55.787 --> 24:57.368
Watch your back, Michael Strahan.

24:57.455 --> 24:59.320
I wouldn't go that far. Let's slow it down.

24:59.415 --> 25:01.326
JASON: I'm gonna call Siefert
and tell him to set his DVR.

25:01.417 --> 25:04.079
-SO proud Of you.
-RICKY: Thank you. Good idea. DO that.

25:04.253 --> 25:05.413
Bella.

25:06.047 --> 25:07.583
Bella. Bella!

25:07.715 --> 25:08.875
Bella!

25:11.010 --> 25:13.467
Bella. Bella. Bella, it's gonna be different now.

25:13.596 --> 25:16.338
-It's gonna be different now.
-I'm happy for you, Ricky. I really am.

25:16.432 --> 25:18.889
You apologized to everyone but me,
and now I gotta go.

25:19.102 --> 25:20.387
But are you...

25:20.478 --> 25:22.719
I promise it's gonna be different now.

25:22.814 --> 25:24.679
-I gotta go. I gotta go.
-Babe, don't do that.

25:24.774 --> 25:26.139
-I gotta go.
-(TIRES SQUEAL)

25:27.652 --> 25:29.984
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-(T|RES SQUEAL)

25:31.072 --> 25:32.061
Shit!

25:35.660 --> 25:37.116
Yeah, I'm not gonna fit in this thing.

25:37.453 --> 25:39.114
Just relax, Mr. Strasmore.

25:40.957 --> 25:42.743
I was sparring with Jay Glazer the other day

25:42.834 --> 25:45.951
and he punched me in the head hard
at least five or ten times.

25:46.129 --> 25:48.085
That's probably gonna
impact the result of this thing.

25:48.214 --> 25:50.455
-We should reschedule.
-It won't. Just lie down.

25:51.718 --> 25:53.003
Think about nice things.

25:53.803 --> 25:54.883
It'll all be over soon.

25:54.971 --> 25:57.053
What the fuck kind of thing
is that to say to somebody?

25:57.140 --> 25:58.380
I mean the test.

25:59.475 --> 26:00.885
It's funny you mentioned Jay Glazer.

26:00.977 --> 26:02.763
You see the interview
with Ricky Jerret yesterday?

26:03.104 --> 26:05.015
Whew. God damn.

26:11.112 --> 26:12.101
Was it that bad?

26:12.196 --> 26:13.527
TECHNICIAN: It was that good.

26:13.698 --> 26:15.689
That brother's some boulders on him.

26:16.117 --> 26:17.607
I love that motherfucker. (CHUCKLES)

26:18.327 --> 26:21.569
(SIGHS) Well, what's not to love?
