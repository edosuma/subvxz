A GOLDENTIDE PICTURES production

00:41.333 --> 00:43.183
We were ambushed from the rear!

00:43.208 --> 00:45.249
<i>Who was the attacker? Was it the North?</i>

00:45.250 --> 00:46.957
Cannot confirm, cannot confirm!

00:46.958 --> 00:48.624
<i>Pull back to sector 31!</i>

00:48.625 --> 00:51.083
Send in reinforcement, we could all die!

00:51.292 --> 00:52.958
<i>Get out of there!</i>

01:40.208 --> 01:41.874
- Leave me.
- Sir?

01:41.875 --> 01:44.018
Just get out of here, asshole!

02:21.750 --> 02:24.875
Run for the GP gate! Now!

02:25.417 --> 02:26.417
Sgt. Lee...

03:08.067 --> 03:14.276
MUSUDAN

03:19.901 --> 03:21.192
Salute!

03:25.692 --> 03:28.399
Lt. Lee is reassigned to a desk job

03:28.400 --> 03:31.108
after suffering a wrist injury.

03:33.025 --> 03:34.441
There's also Lt. Shin Yoo-hwa,

03:34.442 --> 03:38.483
who scored highest marks
in biochemical warfare,

03:38.858 --> 03:41.177
and microbiology in Germany.

03:43.942 --> 03:46.900
<i>Written and directed by GU MO</i>

03:47.067 --> 03:48.067
Salute!

03:48.525 --> 03:51.124
Sorry for bringing you
in during your training.

03:51.192 --> 03:52.192
Sit.

03:58.275 --> 03:59.732
Begin right away, major.

03:59.733 --> 04:01.108
Yes, sir.

04:10.025 --> 04:13.442
6 am on the 14th, a search
party was ambushed.

04:14.067 --> 04:18.108
It took place in Sector 6031km
from Southern Limit Line.

04:18.774 --> 04:21.317
Autopsy photos, it is presumed that...

04:22.067 --> 04:23.608
Who do you think did it?

04:25.608 --> 04:28.150
I can't... tell for sure yet.

04:28.567 --> 04:30.941
With talk of a potential summit,

04:30.942 --> 04:33.817
a clash in the DMZ will be a headache.

04:34.775 --> 04:39.983
I want you to lead a special
detail to find out.

04:40.650 --> 04:43.025
We've already selected your team.

04:47.150 --> 04:49.650
Lt. Shin is the deputy?

05:14.817 --> 05:16.399
That feels good.

05:16.400 --> 05:17.400
Lt. Shin.

05:20.608 --> 05:22.066
You're the best.

05:22.067 --> 05:23.483
That was great work.

05:32.775 --> 05:35.108
Really? You drank all that?

05:38.525 --> 05:40.061
Go wash it.

05:41.733 --> 05:43.691
I don't disrespect Lt. Shin,

05:43.692 --> 05:46.899
but an experienced NCO
should take the role, sir.

05:46.900 --> 05:49.066
You two went through tactical training,

05:49.067 --> 05:52.149
and Mt. Gari infil mission.

05:52.150 --> 05:55.357
This is not even main
mission, what's with you?

05:55.358 --> 05:58.732
But if we're entering DMZ, we should...

05:58.733 --> 05:59.733
What.

06:00.451 --> 06:01.493
Is there a problem?

06:04.207 --> 06:05.248
No, sir.

06:08.983 --> 06:13.317
It's not fair that I got sidelined
because of this damn cast.

06:13.756 --> 06:16.298
- When do you remove it?
- Whenever I want.

06:21.407 --> 06:24.907
That's enough camo paint on your lips.

06:24.983 --> 06:26.025
No bachelors in sight.

06:28.826 --> 06:31.581
It looks like you got blood on it.

06:34.942 --> 06:37.525
<i>Near Civilian Control Line,</i>

06:37.600 --> 06:40.333
<i>dozens of dead chickens were discovered.</i>

06:40.358 --> 06:45.357
<i>According to the locals, as
high as 20 are discovered</i>

06:45.358 --> 06:47.774
<i>on any given day.</i>

06:47.775 --> 06:51.358
<i>Defense Ministry has yet
to release a statement...</i>

06:52.900 --> 06:56.025
Looks like chicken's on
our menu for a week.

06:57.966 --> 06:58.966
Shift change.

06:59.567 --> 07:00.692
Lt. Shin, I'm off.

07:01.775 --> 07:04.650
Oops, this is yours. Sorry.

07:06.230 --> 07:07.937
Later, Lee Hyun-suk.

07:25.413 --> 07:26.538
It's Sgt. Yoo.

07:26.942 --> 07:28.858
- Come in.
- Yes, sir.

07:32.772 --> 07:33.772
Salu...

07:36.733 --> 07:37.733
What?

07:37.983 --> 07:40.775
I thought I was in the wrong room.

07:43.269 --> 07:45.260
How's your skin trouble?

07:45.506 --> 07:48.423
I was feeling sweet tooth, thanks for this.

07:51.542 --> 07:52.542
What's this?

07:52.895 --> 07:54.728
Make-up, of course.

07:55.160 --> 07:56.910
Isn't that for chicks?

08:00.767 --> 08:01.767
Lt. Shin.

08:03.100 --> 08:04.650
Yes, sir.

08:07.376 --> 08:09.164
Something going on?

08:33.849 --> 08:34.849
Salute!

08:35.116 --> 08:37.408
It's the list of members for the detail.

08:37.866 --> 08:40.033
Briefing at HQ, 5 pm.

08:45.117 --> 08:46.158
Are you injured?

08:47.408 --> 08:48.408
Sir?

08:51.325 --> 08:52.325
Sir.

09:08.700 --> 09:12.199
Sgt. Han, did something happen in S603?

09:12.200 --> 09:14.092
Who knows, let's head inside.

09:14.117 --> 09:15.700
How was the field training?

09:15.742 --> 09:17.366
No more shop talk.

09:17.367 --> 09:18.367
Hey, Sgt. Han!

09:19.658 --> 09:21.032
- Salute!
- Sure.

09:21.033 --> 09:22.575
Sgt. Yoo, what brings you here?

09:22.908 --> 09:24.033
Special detail.

09:24.200 --> 09:25.200
Cpt. Jo's?

09:25.658 --> 09:27.450
You too?

09:27.908 --> 09:30.782
Am I bringing down class?

09:30.783 --> 09:33.950
I'm used to it, Sgt. Han.

09:34.367 --> 09:36.699
- Who's the deputy?
- Don't know.

09:36.700 --> 09:39.908
I heard Master Sgt. Park is also selected.

09:40.655 --> 09:42.238
The Grim Reaper?

09:43.425 --> 09:46.050
So he's the deputy...

09:46.075 --> 09:47.575
Let's find out.

09:49.450 --> 09:52.074
Then I'm the junior?

09:52.075 --> 09:53.158
Yup.

09:58.150 --> 10:00.692
- Hey, kiddo.
- Pvt. Lee Jong-hui!

10:01.242 --> 10:02.825
Have you seen a boar?

10:04.242 --> 10:08.199
One stared through me during a drill,

10:08.200 --> 10:10.408
- but my swift kick...
- I've been looking all over.

10:10.992 --> 10:15.367
You must report to HQ for S603 detail ASAP.

10:17.260 --> 10:19.927
Private, do your best, you'll be fine.

10:20.425 --> 10:22.342
What are you talking about?

10:22.483 --> 10:24.450
It's you, petty officer.

10:24.598 --> 10:26.140
- Me?
- Yes.

10:26.876 --> 10:29.038
I'm not falling for that again.

10:29.283 --> 10:30.992
I did my duty.

10:31.533 --> 10:32.825
Take care!

10:33.587 --> 10:35.879
That chump...

10:37.648 --> 10:41.023
Kiddo, I'll read this order form for you.

10:44.367 --> 10:46.325
<i>Mission Order Name: PO Roh Il-kwon</i>

10:54.408 --> 10:57.325
We've just crossed S883.

11:16.225 --> 11:17.932
Let's introduce ourselves.

11:17.933 --> 11:21.517
I'm Lt. Shin Yoo-hwa, deputy
chief of this detail.

11:22.225 --> 11:24.558
Sgt. Han Seung-ho from
sector 3 infil squad.

11:26.100 --> 11:27.182
Good to see you.

11:27.183 --> 11:29.350
I'm in Sgt. Yoo's year, please be at ease.

11:32.475 --> 11:35.642
I serve with Lt. Shin, Sgt.
Yoo of sniper squad.

11:38.725 --> 11:40.682
Staff Sgt. Gu Yoon-gil from sector 3.

11:40.683 --> 11:44.539
I heard you were 1st in
ATT drill, am I correct?

11:44.564 --> 11:45.564
Yes, ma'am.

11:48.808 --> 11:49.933
And you?

11:53.058 --> 11:54.600
- Salute!
- Salute!

11:54.975 --> 11:55.767
Salute!

11:55.892 --> 11:56.892
Salute!

11:59.642 --> 12:01.933
Shin Yoo-hwa...

12:03.454 --> 12:05.329
- Colonel.
- Come in.

12:07.975 --> 12:10.433
We have no idea what happened in 603,

12:10.850 --> 12:13.892
or why the entire search party was killed.

12:14.771 --> 12:19.063
We must uncover the truth
and eliminate the threat.

12:19.767 --> 12:24.683
We deploy at 0600, when
GP 426's shift ends,

12:24.892 --> 12:27.724
until next patrol unit reports at 0600.

12:27.725 --> 12:29.891
Exactly 24 hours.

12:29.892 --> 12:32.058
If we're entering DMZ,

12:32.933 --> 12:34.599
what's our rules of engagement?

12:34.600 --> 12:37.267
We must avoid skirmish, so
ROE is limited at best.

12:37.678 --> 12:41.345
And as such, minimize your gear.

12:43.267 --> 12:45.058
- Check the gear.
- Yes, sir!

12:48.642 --> 12:49.835
Salute!

12:57.779 --> 13:00.779
This is a covert op, so
light-weight loadout,

13:01.892 --> 13:04.642
and silencers are mandatory.

13:05.267 --> 13:06.808
- Sgt. Yoo.
- Yes, ma'am.

13:07.142 --> 13:09.725
Add M18 smoke grenade to the list.

13:11.267 --> 13:12.558
The smoke grenade?

13:12.767 --> 13:13.558
Prepare it.

13:13.748 --> 13:15.866
Any other required gear, ma'am?

13:15.959 --> 13:17.501
- That is all.
- Yes, ma'am.

13:18.206 --> 13:19.835
For this detail,

13:19.975 --> 13:23.850
remove all insignias and unit badges.

13:28.975 --> 13:32.578
Assemble at staging area,
0500 tomorrow, dismissed.

13:34.433 --> 13:35.788
Yes, sweetie.

13:36.058 --> 13:37.058
A gun?!

13:43.308 --> 13:44.308
Salute!

13:45.725 --> 13:48.813
Sweetie, girls should have ballet...

13:49.225 --> 13:53.058
Okay, I'll head home early,
so have dinner with granny.

13:58.017 --> 13:59.017
Salute!

13:59.683 --> 14:01.225
Sir, please head out early.

14:01.600 --> 14:04.000
I'll prep the loadout fit for the mission.

14:09.100 --> 14:10.642
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

14:10.975 --> 14:14.267
Where can I buy realistic replica guns?

14:15.225 --> 14:16.291
Sir?

14:16.975 --> 14:18.183
No, I don't...

14:22.892 --> 14:24.433
She wants a gun...

14:25.350 --> 14:26.392
My daughter...

14:32.058 --> 14:33.807
I'm off, prep properly.

14:33.808 --> 14:34.267
- Yes sir!
- Salute!

14:34.267 --> 14:35.267
Salute!

14:52.308 --> 14:55.127
I did not expect that from him.

14:58.017 --> 14:59.142
Kiddo.

15:02.558 --> 15:04.744
How long till your discharge?

15:06.225 --> 15:07.558
20 days, sir.

15:09.017 --> 15:12.350
Only 20 days left, but you volunteered?

15:13.892 --> 15:14.392
Sir?

15:14.558 --> 15:17.849
- We got a hero.
- That's not it.

15:17.850 --> 15:21.694
I was the chief's radioman during training,

15:22.308 --> 15:24.850
I guess I was assigned because of it.

15:25.392 --> 15:26.475
Assigned, eh?

15:27.183 --> 15:28.609
How old are you?

15:29.850 --> 15:30.975
25, sir.

15:31.558 --> 15:33.100
That means...

15:34.058 --> 15:36.216
he's older than you.

15:40.433 --> 15:41.267
Stay frosty.

15:41.433 --> 15:43.142
- Let's go.
- Okay, I'm off.

15:56.818 --> 15:59.795
Kiddo, no mistakes.

16:18.600 --> 16:19.616
Salute!

16:25.917 --> 16:27.931
They've been briefed.

16:30.617 --> 16:33.158
I will not disappoint you for selecting
me...

16:33.183 --> 16:34.736
I did not select you.

16:37.350 --> 16:39.408
You weren't my choice.

16:43.267 --> 16:48.142
You're not fit for this detail.

16:49.017 --> 16:50.683
No prior DMZ experience.

16:51.392 --> 16:54.892
Shin, it's not too late to bail.

17:00.808 --> 17:02.844
I'll see you at the staging area!

17:03.017 --> 17:04.242
Salute!

17:19.857 --> 17:23.898
Cpt. Jo was an elite since he was a cadet,

17:23.933 --> 17:27.349
so I understand fully why
he was picked to lead.

17:27.683 --> 17:33.183
But why overlook Sgt. Park and
assign you as his deputy?

17:33.600 --> 17:34.777
Hey!

17:34.808 --> 17:36.475
You called me out to tell me that?

17:37.392 --> 17:39.283
Lieutenant, this is live combat.

17:39.308 --> 17:42.200
Frankly, what can a woman do in there?

17:42.225 --> 17:44.722
You can't do much, and it's bug haven.

17:46.058 --> 17:47.308
I washed this today.

17:50.767 --> 17:54.368
Your birthday's in 2 days,
I got you a present...

17:59.433 --> 18:00.683
That sass of hers...

18:06.933 --> 18:08.180
Lt. Shin!

18:08.975 --> 18:10.224
Come with me!

19:01.350 --> 19:04.473
<i>0508 hours</i>

19:04.969 --> 19:06.533
Is everything here?

19:06.558 --> 19:07.798
Yes, Sgt. Yoo.

19:22.318 --> 19:27.193
You have exactly 24 hours
to complete this mission.

19:28.081 --> 19:29.166
Yes, sir!

19:33.183 --> 19:34.186
Roll out.

19:56.767 --> 19:59.349
Passing through S532.

19:59.350 --> 20:01.850
Passing through S532.

20:01.892 --> 20:03.516
Requesting mobile eye check.

20:03.517 --> 20:07.933
Poor signal, ending transmission, over.

20:09.017 --> 20:10.725
Here, chew.

20:11.475 --> 20:13.885
I don't chew gum before breakfast, sir.

20:20.475 --> 20:21.977
We all had breakfast.

20:22.183 --> 20:23.558
Who told you to skip?

20:24.183 --> 20:26.575
Become one with the unit.

20:33.600 --> 20:34.814
Deputy chief.

20:34.933 --> 20:38.462
This won't cause skin
trouble, it's top class.

20:44.017 --> 20:45.350
30 minutes out.

20:54.600 --> 20:59.682
So you're asking me to
check the radio signal...

20:59.683 --> 21:00.225
Salute!

21:00.226 --> 21:04.350
Between war room and admin
HQ, but why should I?!

21:05.225 --> 21:06.975
I'm sorry, sir. At once!

21:07.850 --> 21:09.892
Why am I doing petty chores?

21:10.635 --> 21:12.730
Major's gonna bitch at me.

21:18.428 --> 21:21.803
Cameras are attached to their boonie hats.

21:25.142 --> 21:26.367
What the hell?

21:26.392 --> 21:26.975
Salute!

21:26.976 --> 21:29.391
This is a restricted room,
get the hell out, asshole!

21:29.392 --> 21:30.392
Sorry, sir...

21:34.881 --> 21:36.714
I'm sorry for that, colonel.

21:45.683 --> 21:48.975
<i>Central Forward Area GP
325 Gate, 0600 hours</i>

21:55.063 --> 21:57.563
24 hours to complete this mission and evac.

21:58.495 --> 22:00.245
- Lock and load.
- Lock and load.

22:14.435 --> 22:15.476
2-1, 2-1.

22:15.501 --> 22:18.209
Eagles deploying for S603, over.

22:23.833 --> 22:26.875
GP, seal the gate and don't let anyone in.

22:34.214 --> 22:37.923
3 members of covert ops
disguised as search party

22:38.775 --> 22:42.858
are confirmed dead and
rest are still missing.

22:44.692 --> 22:47.983
This op may need to be
covered up on my end.

22:49.717 --> 22:51.467
That's right, commander.

23:03.920 --> 23:07.962
Lt. Choi, it's the
Milltary Demarcation Line.

23:09.579 --> 23:10.837
Cross.

23:22.704 --> 23:25.292
- It's quite eerie here.
- Right?

23:25.317 --> 23:27.542
Is there anything you want for your b-day?

23:27.567 --> 23:30.179
So that's the good news.

23:31.225 --> 23:33.434
How about a decent man, deputy?

23:33.733 --> 23:35.147
No more small talks.

23:35.358 --> 23:36.358
Yes, ma'am.

23:45.035 --> 23:46.951
3-2-2, on recon route.

23:55.817 --> 23:57.427
- You okay?
- Yeah.

24:19.775 --> 24:20.775
Deputy.

24:21.025 --> 24:22.751
I'll go ahead.

24:34.858 --> 24:37.691
<i>2-1, 2-1, signal check,
requesting signal check, over.</i>

24:37.692 --> 24:41.358
3-2-2, 3-2-2, signal
optimal, visual sitrep?

24:42.733 --> 24:45.650
<i>Eagles flying blind, over.</i>

24:50.983 --> 24:54.150
There was no restricted sign.

24:54.290 --> 24:57.457
Or at least send me a memo.

24:58.368 --> 25:02.201
The radio's on, but what am I to do?

25:10.650 --> 25:12.900
RESTRICTED AREA

25:43.071 --> 25:47.029
Analyzing its clot state,
it's been less than 12 hours.

25:54.029 --> 25:55.253
9 o'clock!

26:03.947 --> 26:05.753
Captain, what is it?

26:06.275 --> 26:08.794
<i>Potential target!</i>

26:27.439 --> 26:29.401
Keep your eyes peeled.

26:33.508 --> 26:34.508
Did you see it right?

26:57.292 --> 26:59.750
Adjusting recon route to 10 o'clock.

27:17.250 --> 27:18.542
Something's here.

27:28.292 --> 27:31.417
If hostiles are spotted,
cut off its retreat.

28:09.917 --> 28:12.125
Chief, Sgt. Han has broken off.

28:13.375 --> 28:14.375
Sgt. Han!

28:15.458 --> 28:17.843
Sgt. Han? Sgt. Han?

28:21.333 --> 28:22.500
Initiating search.

28:22.831 --> 28:25.870
Lt. Shin take left, Sgt.
Park take right, now!

28:31.000 --> 28:32.375
What the hell was it?

28:33.000 --> 28:36.208
<i>No visual, canvasing the premise, over.</i>

28:37.417 --> 28:39.604
Captain, do you copy?

28:41.542 --> 28:43.417
Report continuously!

29:17.140 --> 29:19.473
Yoo, follow me.

29:24.441 --> 29:27.525
I'll debrief when everyone
reports back, over.

29:30.417 --> 29:32.625
We were thorough, but we found nothing.

29:34.316 --> 29:36.191
No sign of hostiles.

29:36.442 --> 29:38.776
Chief, it was the North for sure.

29:39.208 --> 29:41.188
We must tread carefully.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.869
It's floating grass from the swamp.

29:50.223 --> 29:51.807
We must investigate.

29:57.288 --> 30:00.371
See? It was on.

30:16.419 --> 30:20.003
<i>As we expected, there was a detour.</i>

30:20.333 --> 30:22.725
<i>But they're in pursuit of the target.</i>

30:22.750 --> 30:24.292
<i>At current situation,</i>

30:25.083 --> 30:29.750
we can't disregard the fact
that all team may perish.

30:31.950 --> 30:34.117
<i>Yes, don't worry sir.</i>

31:00.210 --> 31:04.267
We're on a tight schedule, you
can't just jump into a swamp.

31:04.518 --> 31:05.794
Master Sergeant...

31:06.475 --> 31:07.475
Chief!

31:14.789 --> 31:16.850
Bleeding occurred within the hour.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.417
Sign of being dragged.

31:24.270 --> 31:25.270
Move!

31:40.541 --> 31:42.184
Follow me.

31:44.097 --> 31:47.389
<i>14 hours until the end of mission</i>

31:48.554 --> 31:51.140
Dragging stopped here.

32:05.801 --> 32:08.718
Do not touch anything until further notice.

32:09.437 --> 32:10.437
Yes, ma'am.

32:16.762 --> 32:17.832
Chief!

32:18.796 --> 32:20.124
It's Han's glove...

32:24.661 --> 32:28.386
You're free to fire at hostiles.

32:46.008 --> 32:48.800
3-2-2, 3-2-2.

32:48.870 --> 32:50.662
Secure the swamp.

33:35.643 --> 33:37.108
Body discovered.

33:37.328 --> 33:39.495
Yoo, report in.

33:41.367 --> 33:42.983
7 bodies confirmed.

33:43.008 --> 33:44.258
Radio!

33:45.883 --> 33:47.592
Nest, nest, this is eagle.

33:48.300 --> 33:52.342
7 bodies found in S301 on SLL, over.

33:52.592 --> 33:56.736
5 bodies are North Koreans
and 2 presumed allies.

34:02.508 --> 34:04.424
<i>Provoked by the North? Where
did the target attack from?</i>

34:04.425 --> 34:07.277
<i>Secure the open area, and continue pursuit.</i>

34:07.467 --> 34:08.525
Copy that.

34:08.550 --> 34:09.706
Over.

34:13.382 --> 34:15.550
- This is Sgt. Lee!
- Don't touch!

34:19.342 --> 34:21.967
One of the bodies is Lee
from the search party.

34:22.632 --> 34:24.900
Resume pursuit, flank the swamp.

34:24.925 --> 34:25.983
Chief!

34:26.007 --> 34:27.059
Move!

34:28.083 --> 34:29.661
Chief!

34:51.475 --> 34:52.100
Sir!

34:52.132 --> 34:54.400
2 of those bodies are
from the search party.

34:54.690 --> 34:57.552
Isn't finding them our primary objective?

35:00.955 --> 35:02.997
Mission objective remains the same.

35:03.175 --> 35:06.257
We evac after rescuing Han
and eliminating the target.

35:06.258 --> 35:08.592
Potential biochemical target was sighted.

35:08.716 --> 35:11.849
Rescuing Han is our priority, move!

35:17.342 --> 35:20.050
Even if they find the deserted bunker,

35:21.050 --> 35:25.258
we sealed it tight back in 2000.

35:26.175 --> 35:29.217
Yes, don't worry, commander.

35:35.373 --> 35:37.275
Why are you here, asshole!

35:37.300 --> 35:39.358
How did you get in here!

35:39.383 --> 35:40.943
I crawled in.

35:41.842 --> 35:44.637
Since when? What did you hear?

35:46.045 --> 35:47.483
What's all this?

35:47.567 --> 35:50.442
Do you send in your men
knowing that they'll die?

35:50.467 --> 35:52.329
- Tell me!
- Son of a bitch!

35:58.976 --> 36:01.358
- Pull him out!
- Let go of me!

36:01.383 --> 36:03.162
Let go!

36:13.117 --> 36:14.983
Lt. Shin, can you hear me?!

36:15.008 --> 36:16.924
<i>Evac now! You'll die there!</i>

36:16.925 --> 36:21.049
MS2 bateriophage, you'll die, pull out now!

36:21.050 --> 36:22.217
The colonel is...

36:23.092 --> 36:24.689
Do you copy?

36:28.717 --> 36:29.717
Chief!

36:30.826 --> 36:32.909
I heard an order for evac, and a gunshot.

36:33.050 --> 36:35.228
What? Radio in.

36:35.842 --> 36:36.967
Nest, nest...

36:39.466 --> 36:40.757
No signal.

36:42.008 --> 36:44.450
Chief, the sample from the swamp

36:44.475 --> 36:46.975
is showing positive reaction to nervine.

36:47.592 --> 36:49.467
It's a confirmation of mutation.

36:52.341 --> 36:56.882
Tell us what's really going on here.

37:03.692 --> 37:06.858
Regardless of the mutation,
and the war room gunshot,

37:06.883 --> 37:09.175
our primary objective is
to eliminate the target,

37:09.800 --> 37:11.684
and evac with Sgt. Han.

37:11.709 --> 37:12.834
Was I excluded

37:14.383 --> 37:17.191
from any necessary intel?

37:17.898 --> 37:18.440
What?

37:18.465 --> 37:21.173
The target we're pursuing may not be human.

37:21.251 --> 37:22.459
Something unimaginable...

37:22.484 --> 37:26.318
That does not change our main objective.

37:32.217 --> 37:35.592
No, which is why I'm bringing this up.

37:35.842 --> 37:37.842
What the hell is going on?!

37:39.008 --> 37:43.175
I didn't come here just to die,
tell us everything you know.

37:45.842 --> 37:50.175
If you're scared, evac to the GP gate!

38:09.842 --> 38:11.925
4 o'clock, source of the blast.

38:12.717 --> 38:13.717
Move.

38:39.217 --> 38:43.050
<i>11 hours until the end of mission</i>

39:00.133 --> 39:02.467
Chief, a bunker sighted at 3 o'clock.

39:04.008 --> 39:05.008
Radio!

39:07.092 --> 39:08.092
2-1, 2-1.

39:09.425 --> 39:11.925
Sir, comm signal is dropping.

39:13.592 --> 39:15.095
Check team comm too.

39:15.925 --> 39:16.965
2-1, 2-1.

39:19.508 --> 39:21.967
There's radio interference
surrounding this area.

39:22.633 --> 39:24.508
Get off comm.

39:26.258 --> 39:30.216
Our target and Han are
likely inside the bunker

39:30.217 --> 39:31.717
considering all circumstances.

39:33.675 --> 39:35.633
We'll move in and eliminate.

39:35.800 --> 39:36.800
Chief.

39:37.592 --> 39:39.342
We must stay on our recon route, sir.

39:42.383 --> 39:45.879
There's no actionable intel
that the target is inside.

39:48.550 --> 39:49.910
Attention.

39:51.425 --> 39:55.175
State your opinions.

39:57.300 --> 40:01.508
If you wish to evac, you
have my permission.

40:02.008 --> 40:02.967
I'll take the heat.

40:02.968 --> 40:05.165
How can we leave Han behind!

40:16.258 --> 40:17.725
Let's do it.

40:18.175 --> 40:22.300
Like he said, let's get Han
and kill everything in there.

40:24.758 --> 40:26.383
Park and I will take point,

40:27.133 --> 40:29.633
deputy and Roh take the flank.

40:29.967 --> 40:33.508
Rest of you cover the rear.

40:34.592 --> 40:35.706
Chief.

40:36.633 --> 40:39.883
Please put Roh on rear
and I'll take his place.

40:47.967 --> 40:50.550
Yoo, are you okay?

40:52.758 --> 40:55.092
Sure, no problem.

41:23.425 --> 41:27.000
They're entering the bunker that
Ministry of Defense sealed.

42:47.670 --> 42:50.250
There is a blood trail.

42:51.258 --> 42:53.496
We have to investigate.

44:12.425 --> 44:14.092
Drop your gun.

44:26.081 --> 44:27.956
Now!

44:45.529 --> 44:48.224
Order your team to come out.

44:55.133 --> 44:57.133
Come on out!

45:02.217 --> 45:07.133
Sons of traitors, one slip
and you'll go to hell.

45:10.492 --> 45:13.407
Wanna see them die?!

45:34.560 --> 45:36.679
Under attack!

45:40.610 --> 45:44.112
Retrieve your weapon and confirm location!

45:50.800 --> 45:53.181
Kill every last one of them!

45:54.425 --> 45:56.342
Roh, provide cover!

46:02.925 --> 46:04.050
Yoo!

46:16.383 --> 46:18.592
Roh, get out of here!

46:27.810 --> 46:29.055
Chief!

46:29.467 --> 46:31.859
Master Sergeant! Cover fire!

46:57.745 --> 46:59.037
Retreat.

47:17.038 --> 47:18.788
Yoo! Cover the rear!

47:39.509 --> 47:41.112
Sgt. Yoo...

47:46.062 --> 47:47.537
Sgt. Yoo...

47:54.787 --> 47:58.113
Gu, get out of here...

48:07.271 --> 48:09.254
Follow me.

48:11.971 --> 48:13.804
2-1, 2-1?

48:16.414 --> 48:17.550
Comm's down...

48:17.575 --> 48:19.575
<i>How the hell are you managing this?</i>

48:19.771 --> 48:20.771
My apologies, sir.

48:21.533 --> 48:22.824
<i>What's the post-op plan?</i>

48:25.326 --> 48:27.993
Biochemical specialist is part of the op,

48:29.849 --> 48:32.349
I'll make sure this doesn't reach you.

48:33.834 --> 48:35.057
Yes, sir.

48:38.284 --> 48:43.743
<i>5 hours until the end of mission</i>

48:46.058 --> 48:48.850
Colonel! All comms and
video feeds are down.

48:51.975 --> 48:53.952
I'll go in myself.

48:54.850 --> 48:56.225
Have a squad ready.

48:58.933 --> 48:59.933
Yes, sir.

49:17.956 --> 49:20.498
We have to find our men at once!

49:51.608 --> 49:53.177
Sgt. Yoo?

50:02.850 --> 50:04.013
What the...

50:05.970 --> 50:10.615
What caused this?

50:27.209 --> 50:28.758
Let's go back.

50:29.142 --> 50:34.523
Look for survivors and secure a radio.

50:58.209 --> 50:59.209
Chief...

51:42.617 --> 51:43.617
Roh?

51:44.157 --> 51:45.778
Sgt. Gu?

51:53.050 --> 51:54.695
Where's the chief?

51:55.785 --> 51:57.702
Weren't you with him?

51:59.058 --> 52:02.367
The radio was hit during the firefight.

52:02.711 --> 52:04.139
What?

52:04.517 --> 52:07.053
What'll happen to us now?

52:39.663 --> 52:41.157
Sgt. Yoo!

52:42.412 --> 52:43.844
Yoo!

52:48.424 --> 52:51.290
Stay awake, please!

52:52.982 --> 52:54.107
Lieutenant.

53:01.339 --> 53:02.817
It's...

53:05.214 --> 53:06.923
too cold here.

53:08.408 --> 53:10.074
Sergeant!

53:12.107 --> 53:13.664
What about Gu?

53:16.767 --> 53:17.767
Sergeant...

53:45.642 --> 53:48.225
<i>1 hour until the end of mission</i>

54:32.646 --> 54:34.198
Only an hour...

54:35.600 --> 54:36.600
until evac.

54:44.415 --> 54:46.748
When you encounter this unidentified being,

54:47.409 --> 54:49.416
will you be able to

54:49.441 --> 54:53.691
obtain DNA samples, and such,

54:53.834 --> 54:57.417
will you step up and complete your duty?

54:58.307 --> 54:59.958
Of course, sir.

55:02.159 --> 55:05.695
It's a conspiracy from the top for sure.

55:07.334 --> 55:10.149
I will not fall back like this.

55:10.174 --> 55:11.716
There must have been

55:12.753 --> 55:16.003
a bacterial experiment of some kind.

55:16.575 --> 55:21.033
Considering physical symptoms
and involvement of the North,

55:21.354 --> 55:25.741
carrier of this bio weapon
must be from the North.

55:26.876 --> 55:28.825
We must

55:29.396 --> 55:32.296
kill it before evac.

55:45.100 --> 55:48.017
Could they've left us and
fallen back to the gate?

55:50.415 --> 55:53.192
Only 19 days till my discharge.

55:54.721 --> 55:56.055
I want to live...

56:08.987 --> 56:11.404
Roh, listen to me.

56:12.081 --> 56:15.206
Reach the recon route and
run for the GP gate.

56:16.829 --> 56:18.137
By myself?

56:18.162 --> 56:20.662
I'll look for the chief, so you go ahead.

56:21.592 --> 56:23.915
Everyone here will die!

56:28.824 --> 56:30.270
Get out of here!

56:30.295 --> 56:31.462
11 o'clock, okay?

56:32.219 --> 56:34.185
Just run!

56:43.225 --> 56:46.058
Let's have a drink back at the base.

57:53.724 --> 57:56.393
Come out!

57:57.182 --> 58:00.464
Come at me, you fuck!

58:46.385 --> 58:47.493
Get down!

59:00.017 --> 59:01.017
Cover!

59:13.650 --> 59:16.254
Have you forgotten our mission?!

59:28.225 --> 59:30.392
Staff sergeant! Gu!

59:33.214 --> 59:34.399
Don't move!

59:35.808 --> 59:38.997
Lt. Shin, retreat to safety!

59:57.308 --> 59:59.142
Hey, Choi Cheol.

59:59.475 --> 01:00:00.767
Stop right there.

01:00:08.017 --> 01:00:12.558
Do as you're told before
I put a bullet in you.

01:00:15.308 --> 01:00:17.761
Why do you think I'm here?

01:00:25.892 --> 01:00:28.517
What is your real mission?

01:00:30.642 --> 01:00:32.905
Now you're curious?

01:00:33.497 --> 01:00:34.954
Bastard.

01:00:35.933 --> 01:00:38.147
Ask that in hell.

01:00:48.312 --> 01:00:49.829
It's all over.

01:00:51.017 --> 01:00:52.683
Go to hell!

01:01:03.350 --> 01:01:04.850
What is the nature of that mutant?

01:01:10.433 --> 01:01:12.652
Was it created in the North?

01:01:12.728 --> 01:01:14.269
'Musudan', you mean?

01:01:26.975 --> 01:01:31.100
<i>When the mission fails,
you'll take the fall.</i>

01:01:58.517 --> 01:01:59.517
Stop!

01:02:12.517 --> 01:02:13.725
Hey!

01:02:20.725 --> 01:02:22.282
Deputy...

01:02:26.767 --> 01:02:27.767
Lower your gun!

01:02:46.017 --> 01:02:47.017
Shoot.

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:50.850
If you can't,

01:02:53.225 --> 01:02:54.892
I'll kill him for you.

01:03:08.767 --> 01:03:11.392
Why did the North create Musudan?

01:03:16.443 --> 01:03:19.235
How could you let it to escape

01:03:19.475 --> 01:03:23.267
even before we could put it in combat?!

01:03:25.017 --> 01:03:30.433
Imagine what'd happen if
the agency found this out.

01:03:30.887 --> 01:03:33.887
If you failed,

01:03:33.912 --> 01:03:40.412
you and your team will become Musudan!
Got it?!

01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:50.808
As an expert infiltrator,
comrade Li'll accompany you.

01:03:53.933 --> 01:03:58.058
Complete your secondary mission
and kill him as you see fit.

01:04:21.373 --> 01:04:26.665
How quickly does the virus
spread from the host?

01:04:29.808 --> 01:04:32.720
It'll get increasingly
harder to contain it.

01:04:36.759 --> 01:04:40.967
I came to kill it and bury it here.

01:04:42.814 --> 01:04:46.022
It's what my friend wanted
before he turned into it.

01:04:54.159 --> 01:04:58.159
<i>We were fighting desperately to survive</i>

01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:01.350
<i>when we met as orphans.</i>

01:05:03.017 --> 01:05:05.267
<i>He was more important than family,</i>

01:05:07.495 --> 01:05:11.370
<i>so it's my fate to send
him off to the afterlife.</i>

01:05:14.975 --> 01:05:19.598
If we can spread via body fluid
and blood with modifications,

01:05:19.808 --> 01:05:22.464
we can wipe out South Korea.

01:05:26.287 --> 01:05:30.162
Once the vaccine is
ready, put him in combat.

01:05:30.991 --> 01:05:31.908
Right away!

01:05:31.933 --> 01:05:32.933
Jae-hak...

01:05:33.017 --> 01:05:38.151
It's the ultimate bio weapon that'll
annihilate USA and the South!

01:05:52.850 --> 01:05:57.183
<i>5 minutes over mission time</i>

01:06:04.683 --> 01:06:05.892
We've crossed S325.

01:06:06.894 --> 01:06:09.200
<i>Have the squad ready at the gate!</i>

01:06:09.287 --> 01:06:12.829
Sir, if Shin fails her mission,

01:06:13.183 --> 01:06:16.555
I'll cover it up as a
provocation by the North.

01:06:23.323 --> 01:06:24.899
Lieutenant.

01:06:26.087 --> 01:06:29.087
If your mission is to kill that thing,

01:06:30.545 --> 01:06:33.253
our goals are the same.

01:06:35.389 --> 01:06:37.764
How about we team up?

01:06:42.617 --> 01:06:45.742
Work side by side with the traitors?

01:06:46.095 --> 01:06:49.178
Whether it heads south or north from here,

01:06:49.706 --> 01:06:51.706
it'll wreak havoc either way.

01:07:18.326 --> 01:07:19.034
Lieutenant.

01:07:19.225 --> 01:07:20.684
Time's up.

01:07:23.185 --> 01:07:24.768
If it came to,

01:07:26.493 --> 01:07:31.951
can you promise that there'll
never be another Musudan?

01:07:33.683 --> 01:07:36.204
Can you do that?

01:07:46.556 --> 01:07:47.556
Hands up, fucker!

01:07:47.823 --> 01:07:49.032
What's wrong?

01:07:51.358 --> 01:07:53.441
This commie's holding a knife!

01:07:54.302 --> 01:07:59.427
No, I was going to make a crutch...

01:08:01.899 --> 01:08:03.281
Stand down.

01:08:14.887 --> 01:08:18.011
I told Roh to keep close eye on Lt. Shin

01:08:18.037 --> 01:08:21.116
before the mission began.

01:08:38.067 --> 01:08:43.149
Due to optic nerves damage,
it is vulnerable to light.

01:09:28.224 --> 01:09:29.709
Yes, colonel.

01:09:30.265 --> 01:09:32.140
We'll enter on your order.

01:09:34.407 --> 01:09:36.657
I'll end this. Yes, sir.

01:09:44.122 --> 01:09:45.122
Is that...

01:09:46.483 --> 01:09:48.457
your final bullet?

01:09:58.488 --> 01:10:01.446
Look for proper C4 placement.

01:10:04.709 --> 01:10:07.834
I'll go and be the lookout.

01:10:18.168 --> 01:10:19.168
Roh.

01:10:20.474 --> 01:10:21.474
Radio?

01:10:21.662 --> 01:10:23.019
I can fix it, sir.

01:10:24.942 --> 01:10:29.733
Head out and reestablish contact
no matter what it takes.

01:10:31.184 --> 01:10:32.184
Sir?

01:10:32.481 --> 01:10:33.522
If we fail,

01:10:34.045 --> 01:10:38.254
you must inform the others
and eliminate Musudan.

01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:44.560
Even if we succeed, you never saw it.

01:10:47.478 --> 01:10:49.453
What do you mean?

01:10:49.871 --> 01:10:51.531
That's how you live.

01:11:10.646 --> 01:11:12.301
I understand.

01:11:13.087 --> 01:11:17.879
I'll see you back at the base.

01:11:19.939 --> 01:11:21.465
In one piece.

01:11:22.715 --> 01:11:23.993
Okay.

01:11:42.246 --> 01:11:44.202
No radio contact yet, sir.

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:48.841
As a backup I'm bringing a
biochemical specialist.

01:11:49.292 --> 01:11:51.208
It's all or nothing.

01:11:51.952 --> 01:11:52.952
We'll enter, sir.

01:11:53.572 --> 01:11:54.572
Roll out!

01:12:16.575 --> 01:12:19.783
We must lure it to the C4 and bury it.

01:12:20.408 --> 01:12:24.242
If that fails, it's the end for us too.

01:12:37.367 --> 01:12:39.995
I'll be the bait and lure it,

01:12:40.617 --> 01:12:42.742
so bury me with my friend.

01:12:48.658 --> 01:12:53.325
Take care of my fallen comrades too.

01:12:56.158 --> 01:12:58.274
Head back alive.

01:13:14.950 --> 01:13:16.783
Yo, Choi Cheol!

01:13:24.658 --> 01:13:26.519
Toss the gun.

01:13:36.783 --> 01:13:39.736
So this is how it ends.

01:14:08.908 --> 01:14:10.325
2-1, 2-1!

01:14:11.575 --> 01:14:13.163
Jae-hak...

01:14:14.658 --> 01:14:16.722
come here.

01:14:29.575 --> 01:14:31.268
Can you hear me?

01:14:37.664 --> 01:14:39.590
Answer me!

01:14:46.890 --> 01:14:50.515
It's me, Cheol.

01:15:06.783 --> 01:15:09.117
Let's die together.

01:15:31.492 --> 01:15:32.998
Lieutenant!

01:15:35.001 --> 01:15:36.126
Chief!

01:16:37.992 --> 01:16:39.825
Lieutenant!

01:16:45.575 --> 01:16:47.367
Shoot!

01:16:49.658 --> 01:16:50.658
Chief!

01:18:13.617 --> 01:18:14.908
<i>2-1, 2-1!</i>

01:18:16.624 --> 01:18:17.891
Stop!

01:18:18.509 --> 01:18:20.093
Where the hell are you?

01:18:20.492 --> 01:18:22.117
<i>I'm at S322, sir!</i>

01:18:25.351 --> 01:18:27.684
Secure the area at once.

01:18:30.078 --> 01:18:31.379
Move!

01:19:08.853 --> 01:19:10.250
What happened?

01:19:11.406 --> 01:19:12.977
Where's Cpt. Jo?

01:19:13.352 --> 01:19:18.269
Captain, Park, Yoo and Han are KIA...

01:19:18.434 --> 01:19:19.790
Enough!

01:19:20.491 --> 01:19:23.134
Retrieve the bodies first.

01:19:35.384 --> 01:19:38.634
Only bodies of Cpt. Jo and
Gu haven't been recovered.

01:19:41.645 --> 01:19:45.854
I've given you painkillers, and
stopped the bleeding, ma'am.

01:19:46.383 --> 01:19:48.256
Good work, thanks.

01:19:48.281 --> 01:19:50.197
Lieutenant, it's the colonel.

01:20:04.984 --> 01:20:06.838
<i>Great work.</i>

01:20:06.863 --> 01:20:09.030
<i>Is the DNA sample secured?</i>

01:20:11.458 --> 01:20:13.093
I could not secure it, sir.

01:20:13.118 --> 01:20:15.535
<i>What? What do you mean?</i>

01:20:19.742 --> 01:20:22.408
5 of my men are dead or missing.

01:20:22.658 --> 01:20:24.208
Haven't you heard?

01:20:24.492 --> 01:20:26.456
<i>You really did not secure it?</i>

01:20:26.481 --> 01:20:27.731
I could not, sir.

01:20:29.742 --> 01:20:32.325
<i>Recover Jo and Gu's bodies for now.</i>

01:20:41.408 --> 01:20:43.408
I searched thoroughly, but
it's not here, major.

01:20:55.283 --> 01:20:58.007
I gave you an order before the mission!

01:20:58.367 --> 01:21:00.796
Did you see her securing a sample?

01:21:00.992 --> 01:21:03.905
What happened with the commies?

01:21:14.658 --> 01:21:17.033
Il-kwon, Roh Il-kwon!

01:21:17.367 --> 01:21:18.748
Look at me.

01:21:19.658 --> 01:21:23.908
One word and you get
discharged with a reward.

01:21:24.075 --> 01:21:26.367
And I get a promotion.

01:21:28.325 --> 01:21:29.724
Il-kwon.

01:21:33.242 --> 01:21:35.950
Or rot in military prison.

01:21:37.617 --> 01:21:40.678
You conspired with the commies.

01:21:43.075 --> 01:21:44.678
It's your call.

01:21:51.492 --> 01:21:52.775
Honestly...

01:21:56.867 --> 01:21:59.117
I didn't see whatever that was inside.

01:22:03.117 --> 01:22:12.658
I only remember the screams
of the men who died.

01:22:18.718 --> 01:22:20.862
Son of a bitch!

01:22:27.783 --> 01:22:29.169
Salute!

01:22:29.742 --> 01:22:32.283
<i>Upon recovering the bodies,
the bunker is being resealed.</i>

01:22:34.617 --> 01:22:38.992
<i>4 hours over mission time</i>

01:22:44.408 --> 01:22:45.673
Hold.

01:22:47.700 --> 01:22:50.742
<i>Lt. Shin, seal it properly and pull out!</i>

01:22:50.796 --> 01:22:54.004
<i>For whom? My fallen comrades?</i>

01:22:54.575 --> 01:22:58.158
<i>Do you want their deaths to be in vain?!</i>

01:22:58.429 --> 01:22:59.556
Move.

01:23:04.867 --> 01:23:06.742
Move out.

01:23:10.158 --> 01:23:11.408
<i>This just in.</i>

01:23:11.658 --> 01:23:15.699
<i>A military vehicle was involved
in an accident at 3PM.</i>

01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:19.617
<i>Killing all passengers,
Ministry of Defense reported.</i>

01:23:19.663 --> 01:23:23.788
<i>Cpt. Jo Jin-ho, Lt. Lee Hyun-suk,
Master Sgt. Park Sang-chul...</i>

01:23:46.056 --> 01:23:49.546
<i>It'll get increasingly
harder to contain it.</i>

01:23:59.742 --> 01:24:01.200
<i>I will...</i>

01:24:01.356 --> 01:24:03.052
<i>kill it for good.</i>
