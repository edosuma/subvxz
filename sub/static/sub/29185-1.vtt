the dream is over.

Uh, I pushed something and
sort of set the engine on fire,

00:22.656 --> 00:24.725
so we need to jump.

you can fly a plane.

that happened,

some time to himself.

on the cover next month?"

what I'm about."

so I finally said yes.

Did him a favor.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.437
Well, you did us all
a favor.

07:52.573 --> 07:55.108
"A thing of beauty
is a joy forever."

He was talking about a vase
or a willow tree or something.

have been talking about

12:46.967 --> 12:49.502
I feel there's been
a little confusion around here

12:49.536 --> 12:51.404
as to who's in charge.

12:51.438 --> 12:54.107
Um, how do you mean?

12:54.141 --> 13:00.247
Well, I -- some people might
think that because you're here,

13:00.280 --> 13:03.951
from London, you have
more authority than me.

13:03.984 --> 13:05.318
Oh, don't worry, Scott.

13:05.352 --> 13:07.720
You're definitely
in charge of Lodge 49.

13:07.754 --> 13:10.757
[Sighs]
Although, obviously,

13:10.790 --> 13:12.792
as the Lodge is
technically under probation,

13:12.826 --> 13:15.028
I will need to sign off
on any proposals

13:15.062 --> 13:16.763
you might have
going forward.

13:21.401 --> 13:25.005
Gerson, this is just
a standard performance review.

13:25.038 --> 13:27.207
You didn't have to
wear a suit.

13:27.240 --> 13:30.243
Exactly.

13:30.277 --> 13:33.180
Okay.

13:33.213 --> 13:36.716
Uh, "speaking on behalf of
the entire executive carousel

13:36.749 --> 13:39.552
at Omni Capital Partners
Food Service West,

13:39.586 --> 13:42.389
your work here
in greatly appreciated."

13:42.422 --> 13:44.724
Thanks.
[Clears throat]

13:44.757 --> 13:46.826
"But due to the...

13:46.860 --> 13:50.463
capricious nature
of global markets,

13:50.497 --> 13:54.601
it is impossible at this time
to authorize the..."

13:57.737 --> 14:00.807
Listen.
There aren't any raises.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.309
I tried.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.477
I really tried.
Rat!

14:04.511 --> 14:07.047
No, hey, come on.
No, no, there's a rat!

[Women screaming]

14:18.091 --> 14:20.994
The rat
is the king of history.

14:21.028 --> 14:23.196
He always wins.

14:32.139 --> 14:34.407
Well, this sucks.

14:34.441 --> 14:36.944
Liz:
I needed grocery money.

14:36.977 --> 14:39.947
Burt gave me $75.

14:43.550 --> 14:46.353
Hey? You've got
roof access, right?

14:46.386 --> 14:48.455
So, you know,
you don't have a TV,

14:48.488 --> 14:51.424
go up
and look at the stars.

14:51.458 --> 14:54.061
You can't see stars
in Long Beach.

14:54.094 --> 14:56.229
Uh-huh.

14:59.532 --> 15:01.434
You know, I could
hook you up at Temp Joy.

15:01.468 --> 15:05.905
Ross said if I bring
a new client, I get 50 bucks.

15:05.939 --> 15:07.107
Split that with you.

15:07.140 --> 15:08.308
Sweet. [Sighs]

15:08.341 --> 15:10.443
My connections
are paying off.

15:10.477 --> 15:11.878
God, come on, look.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.114
I know things look
a little shaky right now,

15:14.147 --> 15:15.815
but you're in
a great spot.

15:15.848 --> 15:16.950
We both are.

15:16.984 --> 15:18.585
Liz,
you paid off your debt.

15:18.618 --> 15:21.354
Everybody dreams about
doing that and you did it.

15:21.388 --> 15:22.855
[Laughs] Yeah.

15:22.889 --> 15:25.658
And my foot...

15:25.692 --> 15:28.695
it's healed.

15:28.728 --> 15:29.896
Don't you see?

15:29.929 --> 15:33.433
Liz, we made it through
the worst year ever.

15:33.466 --> 15:36.903
And now we're free,
we are in open water.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.006
Dud, you almost died.

15:39.039 --> 15:40.007
Again.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.175
[Laughs] I know.

15:42.209 --> 15:44.411
I know.

15:44.444 --> 15:47.814
But it was different
this time.

15:47.847 --> 15:49.949
I saw something.

15:49.983 --> 15:51.684
What?

15:52.919 --> 15:54.287
I saw...

15:54.321 --> 15:57.057
light.

15:57.090 --> 16:03.263
I -- I can't explain it really,
but I just, the...

16:03.296 --> 16:05.432
The shark was a gift.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.500
And it changed me.

16:09.569 --> 16:13.106
And...

16:13.140 --> 16:16.743
it's like
I got a message from Dad.

16:18.511 --> 16:22.582
The universe is good
and I'm on the right path.

16:22.615 --> 16:24.784
What are you talking
about?

16:30.090 --> 16:33.560
Dud, that day on the beach,
I thought I'd lost you.

16:35.728 --> 16:38.798
And if I lost you,
I'd have no one.

16:40.300 --> 16:41.968
[Clears throat]

16:44.104 --> 16:47.240
I am all alone.

16:47.274 --> 16:50.710
Wait,
you're not alone.

16:50.743 --> 16:52.412
I'm always here.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.419
Look...

17:03.390 --> 17:05.925
I think you should come
to the Lodge.

17:08.495 --> 17:13.866
I know, I --
but I found a mentor there.

17:13.900 --> 17:15.868
You know, someone
that's there for me

17:15.902 --> 17:18.905
and someone that...

17:18.938 --> 17:21.941
cares about me.

Liz, hey?
Hey, are you -- are you awake?

18:16.763 --> 18:18.298
Liz?

18:20.833 --> 18:23.470
What do you want?

18:23.503 --> 18:26.873
I wanted to tell you something.
I couldn't wait, sorry.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.715
Liz...

18:35.748 --> 18:38.718
I'm proud of you.

18:38.751 --> 18:40.453
For what?

18:40.487 --> 18:43.156
I don't --
I don't know.

18:43.190 --> 18:45.358
I just am.

18:45.392 --> 18:48.895
I've done nothing
with my life.

18:48.928 --> 18:50.730
So what?

18:50.763 --> 18:55.668
You have so many great things
inside of you.

18:57.270 --> 18:58.571
Dad used to say that
a lot.

18:58.605 --> 18:59.939
It actually
kind of scared him

18:59.972 --> 19:02.475
and he didn't know
what to do with all that...

19:02.509 --> 19:06.979
great stuff inside you.

19:10.650 --> 19:13.920
Dad didn't understand me
sometimes.

19:13.953 --> 19:16.423
But he loved you.

19:16.456 --> 19:18.358
Mmm.

19:38.578 --> 19:40.413
Night.

19:44.717 --> 19:46.319
[Door thuds]

19:49.356 --> 19:52.725
**

19:52.759 --> 19:56.195
Something is missing.
I just don't know what.

19:58.130 --> 20:00.032
No, as -- as kids,

20:00.066 --> 20:02.369
me and my brother
would play Chutes and Ladders

20:02.402 --> 20:04.671
and for some reason,
I always thought it was more fun

20:04.704 --> 20:06.873
going down the chute
than climbing the ladder,

20:06.906 --> 20:09.442
even if that meant losing,
so...

20:09.476 --> 20:12.445
That was screwed up,
obviously.

20:13.746 --> 20:16.249
But when I paid off my debt
and got to zero,

20:16.283 --> 20:19.752
I thought I'd be like,
"I'm a zero!"

20:19.786 --> 20:23.122
But instead, it's like,
"I'm a zero."

20:23.155 --> 20:24.156
You know what I mean?

20:24.190 --> 20:25.658
Zero?

20:25.692 --> 20:28.295
Nothing in my life
adds up.

20:28.328 --> 20:30.263
Where have I been?
Nowhere.

20:30.297 --> 20:32.565
What have I been doing?
Nothing.

20:32.599 --> 20:36.469
Like, restaurants, retail,
six months as a paralegal.

20:36.503 --> 20:40.407
I mean, I told people
I was a paralegal,

20:40.440 --> 20:45.244
but I was really like, just an
office assistant, you know?

20:45.278 --> 20:47.347
Files, getting coffee.

20:47.380 --> 20:50.182
The lawyer was the sister
of this idiot I dated

20:50.216 --> 20:52.752
for like three seconds
in San Diego.

20:52.785 --> 20:54.954
Bobby. Ugh.

20:54.987 --> 20:56.889
[Laughs]

20:56.923 --> 21:00.159
And that was my best job!

21:00.192 --> 21:03.963
It's all just a zigzag
to nowhere, I mean...

21:03.996 --> 21:06.433
Yesterday, I assaulted
a homeless guy in the park.

21:06.466 --> 21:10.370
What?
So, you -- you ask me
what I'm looking for?

21:10.403 --> 21:12.405
I don't have a clue,
Ross.

21:12.439 --> 21:16.743
I'm just like, sliding
down through the cracks.

21:16.776 --> 21:19.979
I'm sorry. I had like, three
coffees before I got here.

21:20.012 --> 21:22.649
[Laughs] I know hearing
about my crap isn't your job.

21:22.682 --> 21:26.085
No, it...
kind of is.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.554
I'm here to help.

21:27.587 --> 21:29.356
I mean,
I can't really speak

21:29.389 --> 21:31.458
to some of
these deeper things,

21:31.491 --> 21:34.126
but you should know
that from what I've seen,

21:34.160 --> 21:35.395
your feelings
are in line

21:35.428 --> 21:38.498
with a large portion
of the workforce.

21:38.531 --> 21:39.999
You're right.
Yeah.

21:40.032 --> 21:42.702
I don't know why I'm being such
a crybaby today. [Laughs]

21:42.735 --> 21:44.737
Listen.
Your test scores are good.

21:44.771 --> 21:46.839
You've got a great
recommendation
from your brother,

21:46.873 --> 21:48.741
who's one of our best.

21:48.775 --> 21:51.043
And to be honest,
you're not the first person

21:51.077 --> 21:53.680
to come through Temp Joy
with some past legal issues.

21:53.713 --> 21:56.683
So, yeah,
we'll get you in the mix.

21:56.716 --> 21:59.752
Great. Thanks.

Champ has a fever.

22:03.790 --> 22:05.458
He's hoping
it's bubonic plague

22:05.492 --> 22:07.360
and says he wants
to take that ride.

22:07.394 --> 22:08.595
[Both chuckle]

22:08.628 --> 22:10.262
Wait, so,
Shamroxx is like, gone?

22:10.296 --> 22:12.198
Yeah,
the building's condemned.

22:12.231 --> 22:13.766
We got our notices
immediately.

22:13.800 --> 22:17.470
Janet sent out a memo
saying it was all net positive.

22:17.504 --> 22:21.307
She said something new was
about to rise from the ashes.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.543
Blammo.

22:23.576 --> 22:25.244
I need to
find something fast.

22:25.277 --> 22:26.579
Sarah's not working
right now.

22:26.613 --> 22:28.615
Something will come up.

22:30.249 --> 22:32.018
It's great to see you,
Liz.

22:32.051 --> 22:34.353
I think we've done a good job
repairing our relationship

22:34.387 --> 22:36.022
since the affair.

22:36.055 --> 22:37.356
We didn't have an affair.

22:37.390 --> 22:38.725
Well, we made-out.

22:38.758 --> 22:39.859
No, we didn't.

22:39.892 --> 22:42.829
We kissed.
Not really.

22:42.862 --> 22:45.465
Our lips did touch.

22:45.498 --> 22:50.069
I mean, you have to
face that fact, Liz.

22:50.102 --> 22:53.673
Okay.
Technically, fine.

22:53.706 --> 22:57.009
Oh. [Laughs]

22:57.043 --> 22:59.579
Well, if I hear Omni's got
any stuff going on,

22:59.612 --> 23:01.180
you know, I'll --
I'll let you know.

23:01.213 --> 23:02.782
No. Thanks.

23:02.815 --> 23:05.885
Uh, I'll take my chances
elsewhere.

23:05.918 --> 23:07.587
Mmm.

23:09.622 --> 23:11.424
Yes.

23:14.193 --> 23:16.629
Oh.

23:16.663 --> 23:18.364
Good luck.

23:22.702 --> 23:25.738
Holy shit,
what is that?

23:25.772 --> 23:28.508
No one else knows
about this.

23:28.541 --> 23:30.810
I want to keep it
that way.

23:32.178 --> 23:33.980
So, you're gonna do it!

23:34.013 --> 23:35.982
You're gonna complete
the magnum opus, just
like Wallace Smith!

23:36.015 --> 23:38.685
Yeah. Well, actually,
I don't know that he did.

23:38.718 --> 23:42.288
Uh, his final act baffles me,
but I'm been preparing,

23:42.321 --> 23:44.356
collecting instruments
and ingredients

23:44.390 --> 23:45.725
for the material process,

23:45.758 --> 23:48.060
which mirrors
the spiritual process.

23:48.094 --> 23:50.162
Making gold.
In a way.

23:50.196 --> 23:52.999
No, I get it. It's an
allegorical metaphor, but still.

23:53.032 --> 23:56.569
First, I -- I need to crack
the code on the diary.

23:56.603 --> 23:57.970
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, right.

23:58.004 --> 23:59.405
But, uh, don't you think
that we should go,

23:59.438 --> 24:00.973
you know,
find El Confidente?

24:01.007 --> 24:03.209
You know, get some info
on the scrolls?

24:03.242 --> 24:05.244
We don't even know
if El Confidente exists.

24:05.277 --> 24:08.548
He might just be a figment
of Larry's imagination.
Yeah. Right.

24:08.581 --> 24:11.618
I mean, El Confidente's
probably just another metaphor.

24:11.651 --> 24:12.885
Shadows and riddles,
right?

24:12.919 --> 24:14.420
Exactly.
Yeah.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.656
The diary is the thing,

24:16.689 --> 24:19.225
so I've been collecting all
the books written by Merrill,

24:19.258 --> 24:22.028
trying to find a clue,
but...

24:22.061 --> 24:25.898
it's a lot, yeah.

24:25.932 --> 24:30.670
Which is why, Dud...

24:30.703 --> 24:35.374
I was hoping that
you would be my...

24:35.407 --> 24:37.777
apprentice.

24:37.810 --> 24:39.211
Are you serious?!

24:39.245 --> 24:41.313
Yeah.
Yes!

24:41.347 --> 24:44.551
Of course!

24:44.584 --> 24:46.586
Great.
Uh, yeah, but why me?

24:46.619 --> 24:48.487
Because I'm way behind
on all this stuff.

24:48.521 --> 24:50.557
Seen and unseen, man.

24:50.590 --> 24:53.025
You know
what I'm talking about.

24:53.059 --> 24:55.728
You got a glimpse of it
on the beach in the light.

24:55.762 --> 24:59.766
Seeing your dad,
the Tongva.

24:59.799 --> 25:02.501
The star field at Orbis.

25:02.535 --> 25:03.703
Did I tell you all that?

25:03.736 --> 25:07.774
In the hospital.
The painkillers.

25:07.807 --> 25:09.542
Yeah, I mean, I...

25:09.576 --> 25:12.044
I guess it could just be
all the toxic fumes in Orbis.

25:12.078 --> 25:14.080
Could've been all that blood
that I lost on the beach.

25:14.113 --> 25:16.549
No. Don't do that.

25:18.685 --> 25:19.952
Yeah.

25:19.986 --> 25:22.188
I don't think so, either.

25:24.891 --> 25:26.893
Thanks, Blaise.

25:26.926 --> 25:29.295
God, but what do I do
with all that?

25:29.328 --> 25:30.863
So, Merrill
was a polymath.

25:30.897 --> 25:31.964
He wrote books on

25:31.998 --> 25:35.101
alchemy, economics,
geology, architecture.

25:35.134 --> 25:37.536
Nobody reads 'em anymore,
because his ideas are obsolete.

25:37.570 --> 25:41.608
Mm-hmm.
The Hollow Earth theory
didn't really pan out.

25:41.641 --> 25:43.009
But you can't take him
literally.

25:43.042 --> 25:45.778
He loved maps, so he wrote
a book on cartography.

25:45.812 --> 25:46.913
He had this idea that

25:46.946 --> 25:49.816
everyone navigates the world
using two maps,

25:49.849 --> 25:52.585
a physical map,
cities and the streets,

25:52.619 --> 25:56.088
but underneath it,
there's a mystical map...

25:56.122 --> 25:58.190
Huh.
...that shows the spots

25:58.224 --> 26:02.228
where the world seems to
let us in on a secret.

26:02.261 --> 26:03.596
[Laughs]

26:03.630 --> 26:07.133
Most people navigate
using just the physical map,

26:07.166 --> 26:10.870
but alchemists
move between the two.

26:10.903 --> 26:14.006
The daylight world,
going to work, eating burritos,

26:14.040 --> 26:18.745
but then there's that other map
waiting down below.

26:21.180 --> 26:23.382
Oh.

26:23.415 --> 26:26.653
This is crazy.
This is crazy. [Chuckles]

26:26.686 --> 26:28.688
Man, I just feel like
everything in my life's

26:28.721 --> 26:31.023
finally
starting to add up.

26:31.057 --> 26:32.491
Lightning in a bottle.

26:32.524 --> 26:34.093
Lightning in a bottle.

26:34.126 --> 26:36.595
Just...

26:36.629 --> 26:37.830
[Sighs]

26:37.864 --> 26:39.632
Feel free.

26:39.666 --> 26:43.703
I feel free to do
whatever I want.

26:43.736 --> 26:47.306
What would you do
if you could do anything?

26:47.339 --> 26:49.308
That's easy.

26:49.341 --> 26:51.277
Clean pools.

26:51.310 --> 26:55.114
**

26:55.147 --> 26:56.548
You know, Alice,

26:56.582 --> 26:58.751
I really want to get you
something nice

26:58.785 --> 27:00.619
for saving my life.

27:00.653 --> 27:02.855
I told you,
I don't want anything.

27:02.889 --> 27:04.390
I know, I know.

27:04.423 --> 27:06.158
But, you know, it's just,
I can't help but feel

27:06.192 --> 27:09.195
it's not fair that I'm the one
getting celebrated in the paper

27:09.228 --> 27:11.898
and you're not.
No one's celebrating you.

27:11.931 --> 27:13.966
Ehh...

27:14.000 --> 27:15.467
Yeah.

27:15.501 --> 27:18.104
What about a new board?

27:18.137 --> 27:19.638
Or like...

27:21.273 --> 27:24.643
...state-of-the-art
electronics?

27:24.677 --> 27:26.879
[Laughs]
You don't have any money, dude.

27:26.913 --> 27:29.615
Mmm.

27:29.648 --> 27:32.551
[Door dings]

27:32.584 --> 27:34.053
Sean Dudley?

27:34.086 --> 27:36.522
Yeah?

27:36.555 --> 27:38.657
I'm here
to give you money.

27:38.691 --> 27:42.261
**

27:44.797 --> 27:48.167
Dud:
So...you're a lawyer.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.102
Call me whatever you want.

27:50.136 --> 27:52.071
I read about you in the paper,
you were in pain.

27:52.104 --> 27:54.440
I'm here to fix that.
Oh, my leg?

27:54.473 --> 27:55.908
No, I mean,
it hurts a little bit,

27:55.942 --> 27:57.910
but it's healing okay and
it's gonna have a crazy scar.

27:57.944 --> 28:00.279
You suffered a tragedy.
You deserve to be compensated.

28:00.312 --> 28:01.680
The responsible party
has to pay.

28:01.714 --> 28:04.483
Well, I don't -- I don't think
you can sue the ocean.

28:04.516 --> 28:06.018
State, county, city.

28:06.052 --> 28:07.653
What if I told you they all
knew about the shark problem

28:07.686 --> 28:09.889
and they covered it up,
those greedy bastards?

28:09.922 --> 28:11.690
Shit.

28:11.724 --> 28:14.827
Really?
Oh, yeah.
That could definitely be true.

28:14.861 --> 28:16.662
Okay, look, now that
we're working together,

28:16.695 --> 28:18.998
you only have one job
and that is to trust me.
Yeah.

28:19.031 --> 28:19.999
Got it?
Mm-hmm.

28:20.032 --> 28:21.433
They don't want
to go to trial.

28:21.467 --> 28:22.835
They're gonna want
to settle fast,

28:22.869 --> 28:24.837
so I will provide
my law services pro bono,

28:24.871 --> 28:26.839
which is Latin
for "free" --
I know what pro bono means.

28:26.873 --> 28:28.507
-- until we get
your medical expenses paid,

28:28.540 --> 28:30.209
plus, a nice, fat chunk
on top of that, okay?

28:30.242 --> 28:33.512
Now, I'll just need you
for the occasional deposition.

28:33.545 --> 28:36.015
I like to go deep,
get a lot of detail.

28:36.048 --> 28:39.018
Other than that, you just sit
back and wait for the money.

28:39.051 --> 28:40.686
It's guaranteed.

28:40.719 --> 28:41.687
So...

28:41.720 --> 28:43.790
this is pretty much
guaranteed?

28:43.823 --> 28:45.624
So, this is pretty much
guaranteed.

28:45.657 --> 28:46.959
And what I want to do,
Burt,

28:46.993 --> 28:48.494
is leverage some
of my future shark earnings.

28:48.527 --> 28:51.297
Okay, let's say, mmm,
a grand, for now,

28:51.330 --> 28:54.500
okay, on friendly terms,
okay?

28:54.533 --> 28:56.402
And then down the road,
I'll give you, like,

28:56.435 --> 28:58.637
10% of my settlement.

29:03.309 --> 29:05.878
Where did you go
to law school?

29:05.912 --> 29:07.379
Yale.

29:07.413 --> 29:09.181
Yale, Burt.

29:09.215 --> 29:10.649
Yale.

29:12.151 --> 29:13.652
Okay.

29:13.685 --> 29:16.923
30% on the grand,
month term,

29:16.956 --> 29:22.461
plus, I get a dime on whatever
your law provider brings in.

29:22.494 --> 29:23.930
I'll write it up.

29:23.963 --> 29:26.598
Great and, uh, I'm gonna
grab Liz's TV while I'm here,

29:26.632 --> 29:28.000
because we need that.

29:28.034 --> 29:31.403
Uh, and I'll take
one of these, too.

29:33.105 --> 29:34.673
Right.

29:34.706 --> 29:37.176
You're like an angel.
Mmm. Yeah, yeah.

29:37.209 --> 29:38.710
I am.

29:39.979 --> 29:43.983
Ooh!
That looks like
a Goddamn dragon bite.

29:44.016 --> 29:47.419
[Laughs] Dragon of the sea,
man, yeah.

29:47.453 --> 29:48.754
[Bell ringing in distance]
Uh, is Ernie here,

29:48.787 --> 29:49.922
'cause I can't wait to
tell him the whole story.

29:49.956 --> 29:52.158
Didn't he come
to the hospital?

29:53.359 --> 29:57.029
Nah.
Are you sure you can drink,
taking antibiotics?

29:57.063 --> 30:00.833
Yeah. Mmm. I think that's
just something doctors say.

30:00.867 --> 30:01.868
People?!

30:01.901 --> 30:04.803
I've been ringing the bell,
let's go!

30:04.837 --> 30:06.505
Come on,
you knights and knaves,

30:06.538 --> 30:08.074
let's start the meeting.

30:10.709 --> 30:14.480
Maybe we should...
wait for Ernie?

30:16.115 --> 30:17.783
So, mark your calendars.

30:17.816 --> 30:21.020
We have Mystic Chords of Memory
coming up.

30:21.053 --> 30:22.754
Plus, the rummage sale

30:22.788 --> 30:26.392
and the official start
of bowling season.

30:26.425 --> 30:29.962
[Clears throat]
Uh, finally...

30:31.330 --> 30:34.433
...as you know, London
has put us under probation.

30:34.466 --> 30:37.669
Which means it is incumbent
upon all of us

30:37.703 --> 30:41.407
to come together and meet
their stipulated benchmarks,

30:41.440 --> 30:43.142
in terms of boosting
membership numbers

30:43.175 --> 30:47.113
and maintaining
our financial responsibilities.

30:47.146 --> 30:48.480
Now, I'm going to be placing

30:48.514 --> 30:50.482
more ads
about renting out the hall.

30:50.516 --> 30:53.685
Weddings, funerals, seminars,
whatever.

30:53.719 --> 30:56.022
We cannot have this place
sitting here empty

30:56.055 --> 30:57.289
on the weekends.

30:57.323 --> 31:01.360
So, that means more volunteers
to oversee events.

31:09.235 --> 31:11.938
Also, I am calling in
everyone's bar tabs.

31:11.971 --> 31:14.173
[Indistinct yelling]
What?! No!

31:14.206 --> 31:16.108
Scott, this is nuts!

31:16.142 --> 31:19.645
Austerity doesn't work!
Exactly.
It's a Puritan wet dream.

31:19.678 --> 31:22.714
Yeah,
total wet dream.
Jocelyn, man,
did you approve this?

31:22.748 --> 31:24.516
Uh, well, Scott and I went
through the books together.

31:24.550 --> 31:26.485
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait,
wait a minute.

31:26.518 --> 31:28.320
I  approved it. Okay?

31:28.354 --> 31:30.756
Me.
Sovereign Protector, all right?

31:30.789 --> 31:34.293
That's all that matters.
[Indistinct muttering]

31:34.326 --> 31:37.796
Oh, come on? Larry let
this place fall to pieces!

31:37.829 --> 31:41.533
Now, we have to face reality,
okay?

31:41.567 --> 31:45.037
Oh, nice!
Nice attitude, Rooney.

Careful.
That is an Orbiscope.

32:05.691 --> 32:07.426
Merrill designed it
himself.

32:07.459 --> 32:09.028
Sorry.

32:09.061 --> 32:10.362
Oh, you're fine.

on you.

Don't remember the last time I
saw someone else in the archive.

You looking
for something?

32:23.175 --> 32:24.776

32:24.810 --> 32:27.446

Uh, I don't know.

32:27.479 --> 32:30.216
I saw an old engraving
in the tavern.

32:30.249 --> 32:31.917
It wasn't marked, but...

32:31.950 --> 32:36.855
I swear it looked like the view
from Signal Hill in Long Beach.

32:36.888 --> 32:39.025

32:40.392 --> 32:41.994
Yeah. [Laughs]

32:42.028 --> 32:44.230
I've heard about your exploits
in the tavern.

32:44.263 --> 32:46.265

Oh, yeah.

that aren't there?

to talk to my boss, Melinda.

do you want a latte?

I might catch you here

a Dr. Kimbrough in there?

Uh, no, he's over there.

Temp Joy sent me.

37:36.422 --> 37:37.756
Are you Dr. Kimbrough?

Yes, I'm Dr. Kimbrough.
God, Jesus!

No, I just thought this was
going to be a doctor's office.

Who is it?!

38:04.149 --> 38:06.518
Uh, a woman.

38:06.552 --> 38:10.021
She said she wants the toad
to call her back.

She's the toad,

I'm not.

Do you understand?

38:18.864 --> 38:20.566
Yes.

Hey, where'd you get
that?

how to shred?

Shh!

You're going to shred
everything in all these boxes.

Oh. Sure.

What is all this?
Shh!

that that is even true?

38:45.824 --> 38:48.360

Can you prove it?

You can call Ross

the place was a dump.

I'm glad you're here.

introduce myself

40:15.581 --> 40:18.850

offer my services.

the wrong way --
No. No.

talk to you about.

You can't run.

You left me high and dry and
stole my Goddamn tiger van.

47:18.203 --> 47:20.605
But I'm in a forgiving mood,
