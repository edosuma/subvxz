Turns everyone into
a goddamned Hallmark card.

52:01.387 --> 52:04.261
People want to say what
they've been meaning to say.

52:04.345 --> 52:06.136
How about:
Here's a fucking kidney?

52:06.220 --> 52:09.178
All I've got is: They're doing
wonders with xenotransplants.

52:09.261 --> 52:11.887
I'm a little rough
on my Greek.

52:11.970 --> 52:13.720
Pig kidneys.

52:13.804 --> 52:15.220
You're already
pig-headed.

52:15.303 --> 52:17.679
I don't see why you wouldn't
want a kidney to match.

52:17.762 --> 52:19.387
I'd rather die.

52:19.470 --> 52:21.929
You might.

52:22.011 --> 52:25.136
One thing I know
about the Greeks,

52:25.220 --> 52:27.970
the great tragedies

52:28.053 --> 52:31.261
rarely featured
death scenes.

52:31.345 --> 52:33.512
Plain left that shit
offstage.

52:33.595 --> 52:37.845
They just did not
find it interesting.

52:37.929 --> 52:40.261
Living--

52:40.345 --> 52:42.428
that's the real drama.

52:42.512 --> 52:44.637
The real classroom.

52:46.970 --> 52:50.136
Plenty of lessons
left to teach.

52:52.011 --> 52:53.136
You're worried
about Willow.

52:53.220 --> 52:54.845
Good God no.

52:54.929 --> 52:57.762
She won't even remember me,

52:57.845 --> 53:00.053
and she'll have
her mother

53:00.136 --> 53:03.637
to fill her
full of whatever.

53:03.720 --> 53:07.679
But Chuck...

53:07.762 --> 53:10.136
if I'm not here

53:10.220 --> 53:13.553
to push him,
to mold him,

53:13.637 --> 53:18.136
who knows all the ways
he'll fuck himself up.

I went halfway

You won.

53:41.845 --> 53:43.970
For the moment.

53:44.053 --> 53:46.428
Did you make good
on your threat?

53:49.553 --> 53:51.470
Good.

53:51.553 --> 53:53.804
Would you have really
followed through, though?

53:53.887 --> 53:56.387
It's possible
something inside me

53:56.470 --> 54:00.011
would have caught,
backed down.

54:00.095 --> 54:02.178
I truly don't know.

54:02.261 --> 54:03.345
Would you have?

54:03.428 --> 54:05.303
Yup.

54:05.387 --> 54:07.553
Which would have been
unfortunate.

54:07.637 --> 54:09.595
Because then

54:09.679 --> 54:12.136
we couldn't
have enjoyed

54:12.220 --> 54:13.387
this.

54:18.387 --> 54:23.470
Is, uh, this a reward,

54:23.553 --> 54:24.679
Both.

54:24.762 --> 54:26.220
Neither.

54:26.303 --> 54:28.887
Whatever we want
to make of it.

54:28.970 --> 54:30.762
Come on.

54:35.428 --> 54:37.470
I'm sorry Axe saw it.

54:40.095 --> 54:41.178
You know,
I didn't show it to him,

54:41.261 --> 54:42.762
I didn't try to
show it to him anyway--
