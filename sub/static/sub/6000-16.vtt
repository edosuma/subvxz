00:00.007 --> 00:01.490
Previously on "Finding Carter... "

00:01.515 --> 00:03.561
- What do you think he's up to?
- I can't figure out what it is.

00:03.586 --> 00:05.723
In the end, people show
you who they really are.

00:05.748 --> 00:06.484
You gotta pay attention.

00:06.509 --> 00:07.925
Did she send you here to babysit me?

00:07.950 --> 00:09.296
- I'm trying to help you.
- Stop.

00:09.321 --> 00:11.190
- I don't want to lose you.
- It's too late.

00:11.215 --> 00:13.709
My publisher said my tour dates are locked.

00:13.734 --> 00:16.254
Do you think that this is the
best time for you to leave?

00:16.280 --> 00:19.633
How could you sit there
and eat dinner with them

00:19.658 --> 00:20.929
and then steal from my dad?

00:20.954 --> 00:22.055
Screw you.

00:22.080 --> 00:23.368
He took your watch with him.

00:23.392 --> 00:24.562
You talking about this watch?

00:24.588 --> 00:26.390
He packed up his things and left.

00:26.415 --> 00:28.861
I have no idea where he is.

00:39.626 --> 00:41.348
- Thanks.
- Okay.

00:41.373 --> 00:43.734
Velvet plum or candy charade?

00:43.759 --> 00:45.841
Do you ever wonder about
the fate of womankind

00:45.866 --> 00:48.217
when these are the first
choices we make every morning?

00:48.242 --> 00:49.742
Not if we make the right choice.

00:49.767 --> 00:52.336
- Candy.
- Great choice.

00:54.482 --> 00:57.139
You've been checking your phone
every ten seconds since you woke up.

00:57.164 --> 00:58.672
I'm trying to get Ben to answer me.

00:58.697 --> 01:00.406
Well, you're officially entering territory

01:00.431 --> 01:02.555
reserved for telemarketers and stalkers.

01:02.580 --> 01:04.753
I know. I've tried everything.

01:04.778 --> 01:07.446
Remorse. Humility.

01:07.471 --> 01:08.836
Contrite emoji face.

01:08.861 --> 01:11.437
And you think overwhelming
him with texts is gonna help?

01:11.657 --> 01:13.835
I feel awful.

01:13.860 --> 01:16.055
I went out of my way to make
him feel like he could trust me

01:16.080 --> 01:18.335
and then I accused him of stealing.

01:18.634 --> 01:19.983
I just want to apologize.

01:20.008 --> 01:21.374
Well, it sounds like you've tried.

01:21.399 --> 01:22.982
Now you just have to leave it alone.

01:23.007 --> 01:25.090
I can't just leave it alone, Taylor.

01:26.665 --> 01:28.109
Okay.

01:28.134 --> 01:30.109
What can I do now?

01:31.974 --> 01:34.058
I'm not quite with this

01:34.083 --> 01:37.648
"Let's go say hi to my sister's
former kidnapper," plan.

01:37.673 --> 01:38.755
I get it.

01:38.780 --> 01:40.343
But she was the last person to see him.

01:40.369 --> 01:41.944
Carter?

01:41.969 --> 01:43.335
Taylor.

01:43.360 --> 01:45.242
- What a surprise.
- Yeah.

01:45.267 --> 01:47.351
Um, we're looking for Ben.

01:47.376 --> 01:49.910
Well, I wish I could tell
you that I've heard from him.

01:49.935 --> 01:51.674
Well, do you have any
idea where he might be?

01:51.699 --> 01:53.445
Maybe one of his old
foster homes or something?

01:53.470 --> 01:54.446
I have no idea.

01:54.471 --> 01:56.492
And I can't call social services and ask.

01:56.517 --> 01:58.414
I have a home study visit coming up soon.

01:58.439 --> 02:00.267
It would not look good if
I don't know where he is.

02:00.292 --> 02:01.839
What's a home study visit?

02:01.864 --> 02:04.148
His social worker comes
to check things out,

02:04.173 --> 02:05.289
make sure he's okay.

02:05.314 --> 02:07.281
And what happens if he's not there?

02:07.306 --> 02:10.181
Chances are I lose him for good.

02:41.470 --> 02:42.656
- Hey, Max.
- Hey.

02:42.681 --> 02:44.719
My dad was just showing me
his route for the book tour.

02:44.744 --> 02:46.117
Oh. Where all does it take you?

02:46.142 --> 02:48.108
26 cities in two months.

02:48.133 --> 02:49.765
That's a lot of cities.

02:49.797 --> 02:50.797
I don't mind the travel,

02:50.822 --> 02:52.102
it's the interviews that get to you.

02:52.127 --> 02:53.877
The same questions over and over.

02:54.482 --> 02:55.898
And a lot of bad coffee.

02:55.923 --> 02:56.996
Where's the first stop?

02:57.392 --> 02:58.617
Poughkeepsie.

02:58.642 --> 03:00.461
You know the post office
there was commissioned

03:00.486 --> 03:02.476
by Franklin Roosevelt in 1937?

03:02.501 --> 03:04.418
Hope that's not its claim to fame.

03:04.443 --> 03:05.391
I'm afraid it is.

03:05.416 --> 03:07.820
But my publishers say it's
all part of the strategy.

03:07.845 --> 03:10.806
Yeah, well, I hope this
strategy still includes

03:10.831 --> 03:13.257
taking me to high school
orientation tomorrow.

03:13.282 --> 03:14.391
Is that tomorrow?

03:14.416 --> 03:15.461
Whoa, you're already going to that?

03:15.486 --> 03:15.992
Yeah.

03:16.906 --> 03:18.565
Next year I join the big leagues.

03:18.590 --> 03:20.921
They like to prepare us
middle schoolers early.

03:20.963 --> 03:23.130
I'm supposed to sign some
papers with my publisher,

03:23.155 --> 03:24.937
but I'll move things
around. I can make it work.

03:25.574 --> 03:28.441
I can take him. I can show you what's what.

03:28.466 --> 03:30.433
Yeah. Yeah, that'd be awesome.

03:30.458 --> 03:31.750
You sure, bud?

03:31.775 --> 03:33.500
Well, you're taking off for two months,

03:33.525 --> 03:36.632
so I mean, might as well get used to it.

03:38.812 --> 03:41.225
Well, done and done, then.

03:48.861 --> 03:50.732
Hey.

03:51.514 --> 03:53.180
Carter.

03:53.205 --> 03:54.578
Taste this.

03:54.603 --> 03:56.803
Okay.

03:58.619 --> 04:00.536
Mmm. What is that?

04:00.561 --> 04:02.132
I'm calling it the Magic Hour Mojito.

04:02.157 --> 04:04.574
Got a Bachelorette party
coming in next week,

04:04.599 --> 04:05.548
and they requested them.

04:05.573 --> 04:07.570
Ah. Drunk bachelorettes.

04:07.595 --> 04:09.000
I'll be off that night, right?

04:09.025 --> 04:10.544
You know, actually, I
was gonna teach you how

04:10.569 --> 04:12.269
to make these so you
could take care of them.

04:12.294 --> 04:13.563
Wow.

04:13.588 --> 04:16.007
And here I was thinking you
were starting to like me again.

04:16.031 --> 04:18.125
Please. You know you're good for business.

04:18.149 --> 04:19.490
You're natural with the customers,

04:19.515 --> 04:20.858
and you're fast with the register.

04:20.884 --> 04:23.758
Are you saying you're glad I
made you give me a second chance?

04:23.783 --> 04:25.859
Why don't we focus on making mojitos.

04:25.884 --> 04:27.959
Sure.

04:28.950 --> 04:31.293
Mint. Lime.

04:31.318 --> 04:35.159
Now, the secret to a perfect
mojito is the muddle.

04:35.252 --> 04:37.558
Give it a go.

04:37.583 --> 04:39.570
Oh. What are you doing?

04:39.595 --> 04:41.148
- What?
- Really. Here.

04:41.173 --> 04:43.676
- You gotta mash it, all right?
- Mash.

04:43.701 --> 04:45.075
- Mash it.
- Don't shred.

04:45.100 --> 04:46.817
- Okay.
- Mash.

04:46.842 --> 04:48.317
Gentle and firm.

04:48.342 --> 04:50.082
Perfect.

04:52.018 --> 04:53.101
What?

04:53.126 --> 04:55.551
Like I said, you're good for business.

04:56.432 --> 04:58.851
Okay. Now get some club soda.

05:00.506 --> 05:02.450
Hey, Liz, you got a sec?

05:02.475 --> 05:03.794
Yeah, what's up?

05:03.819 --> 05:06.099
It's about an arrest I made.

05:06.124 --> 05:07.388
I thought you might want to know about it.

05:07.413 --> 05:08.473
One of my cases?

05:08.499 --> 05:11.574
Actually, it's Kyle Madeiros' boy.

05:11.599 --> 05:13.373
Gabe.

05:21.181 --> 05:22.547
Here.

05:22.572 --> 05:25.799
You can't tell me I
didn't mix that one right.

05:26.681 --> 05:28.982
Oh, sugar. Definitely more sugar.

05:29.007 --> 05:30.974
What? That was spot on.
You're just messing with me.

05:30.999 --> 05:32.099
Just give it one more go.

05:32.124 --> 05:34.499
Fine. That one was perfect.

05:34.524 --> 05:37.198
Whoa!

05:39.180 --> 05:42.339
I guess it's okay to smell like
a bar if you work in one, right?

05:42.364 --> 05:45.456
In my office, got a bag, a
couple extra shirts, grab one.

05:45.481 --> 05:46.634
- Sorry.
- Right.

05:46.659 --> 05:48.667
Thank you.

05:52.568 --> 05:53.659
Where are they?

05:54.328 --> 05:57.329
I gotcha. Hold on.

06:03.280 --> 06:04.780
There you go.

06:04.805 --> 06:07.159
Thank you.

06:15.887 --> 06:18.687
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.842
It's the alcohol.

06:20.867 --> 06:24.037
I mean, I've been wanting
to do that for a long time.

06:35.203 --> 06:38.454
He blew a .16 on the breathalyzer.

06:38.479 --> 06:39.798
What'd they do with his car?

06:39.823 --> 06:42.274
They towed what was left
of it to the impound.

06:42.299 --> 06:43.598
It was bad.

06:43.623 --> 06:45.901
Thanks for coming to me first.

06:47.313 --> 06:49.480
He's lucky to be alive.

06:49.769 --> 06:54.154
Oh, and there was somebody with
him, but he had no I.D. on him.

06:54.179 --> 06:57.300
I owe you one. Thanks.

07:14.993 --> 07:16.075
Ben?

07:16.100 --> 07:17.399
You two were together?

07:17.424 --> 07:18.706
Yeah, we were together.

07:18.731 --> 07:19.986
Are you all right?

07:20.011 --> 07:22.220
Yeah, we're a little banged
up, but nothing major.

07:22.245 --> 07:25.525
Gabe, you could have killed
yourself or someone else.

07:25.550 --> 07:27.557
Do you know what you blew
on that breathalyzer?

07:27.582 --> 07:28.799
Yeah, your friend told me.

07:28.824 --> 07:31.487
He's really your friend,
because he's not charging you.

07:31.511 --> 07:32.886
Do you know how lucky you are?

07:33.220 --> 07:34.852
Yeah.

07:34.877 --> 07:37.393
I'm the luckiest guy on Earth.

07:37.542 --> 07:39.992
All right, I'm taking you both home.

07:40.017 --> 07:43.292

08:14.165 --> 08:15.983
No, no, neither do I.

08:18.609 --> 08:22.726

The bar's in the hole.

08:40.049 --> 08:41.591
A pretty deep hole.

08:41.616 --> 08:43.006
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

08:43.032 --> 08:44.718
How? It's packed almost every night.

08:44.743 --> 08:46.546
Gentrification.

08:46.571 --> 08:48.270
The rents in this hood are just going...

08:48.295 --> 08:49.646
Insane.

08:49.671 --> 08:51.148
What are you gonna do?

08:51.173 --> 08:53.037
Well, have you ever thought of moving it?

08:53.062 --> 08:54.718
It's a family business.

08:54.743 --> 08:59.016
You know, it's been in this
spot for three generations.

08:59.599 --> 09:02.316
Just doesn't feel right, you know?

09:02.965 --> 09:05.099
That sucks.

09:05.231 --> 09:06.648
This place is awesome.

09:06.673 --> 09:08.147
It is, isn't it?

09:08.210 --> 09:10.780
It's an institution.

09:13.109 --> 09:14.691
Thanks.

09:14.716 --> 09:18.346
Don't worry about it, okay?
I'll figure something out.

09:19.373 --> 09:21.085
Okay. Okay.

09:21.110 --> 09:22.085
I should get back.

09:22.110 --> 09:25.085
Boss lazing around all day

09:33.414 --> 09:35.821
Hey. Thank you.

09:35.846 --> 09:38.130
The last thing I need is
another charge on my record.

09:38.155 --> 09:40.021
Oh, they weren't gonna charge you,

09:40.046 --> 09:43.620
but they won't release a minor if
he's been drinking without an adult.

09:43.645 --> 09:44.760
Well, thank you for driving me.

09:44.785 --> 09:46.021
You're welcome.

09:46.046 --> 09:49.321
That's one of the benefits
of having a cop as a...

09:50.075 --> 09:53.414
Well, knowing a cop. It's a benefit.

09:53.439 --> 09:55.307
Yeah, it doesn't seem
like Gabe got that memo.

09:55.332 --> 09:57.389
Yeah, we're not in a good place right now.

09:57.414 --> 09:58.952
Hop in.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.219
I can handle it.

10:03.244 --> 10:05.579
It's another benefit of being a cop.

10:05.604 --> 10:09.079
You learn to deal with
people at their worst.

10:11.750 --> 10:13.583
Ben.

10:13.891 --> 10:15.606
Are you bleeding?

10:15.631 --> 10:16.546
Oh.

10:16.571 --> 10:18.457
Yeah, I cut it pretty bad.

10:18.482 --> 10:20.217
We have to take care of that.

10:20.243 --> 10:22.559
You're coming home with me.

10:29.717 --> 10:31.833
I thought you were the delivery guy.

10:31.858 --> 10:33.850
Well, my mom called me. Are you okay?

10:33.875 --> 10:34.741
I'm fine.

10:34.766 --> 10:37.407
But you can thank her for spreading
my business all over town.

10:37.431 --> 10:39.584
It's not all over town, it's me.

10:39.610 --> 10:41.234
Whatever. It was a dumb mistake.

10:41.258 --> 10:42.824
Yeah, it was.

10:42.849 --> 10:44.363
Gabe, you have to stop.

10:44.388 --> 10:46.417
If it wasn't for my mom,
you'd be in jail right now.

10:46.442 --> 10:48.050
This isn't an Afterschool Special.

10:48.075 --> 10:49.357
I don't need a lecture.

10:49.382 --> 10:51.925
- Just drop it, okay?
- No, I'm not gonna drop it.

10:52.134 --> 10:54.468
I care about you, Gabe. We all do.

10:54.493 --> 10:56.828
- I'm fine.
- You're obviously not.

10:56.853 --> 10:58.875
Enough, okay? I'm done talking about it.

10:58.900 --> 11:00.665
Tell your mom to stay out of my business.

11:00.690 --> 11:03.093
She didn't have to come to
my rescue and neither do you.

11:03.118 --> 11:04.800
Fine. I'll leave.

11:04.825 --> 11:06.427
Yeah.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.101
And you know what?

11:09.126 --> 11:10.792
If you can't find anything
else to talk about

11:10.817 --> 11:13.101
other than what a screw-up
I am, don't come back.

11:13.126 --> 11:15.880
Don't worry, I won't.

11:18.275 --> 11:19.835
There you go.

11:19.860 --> 11:21.648
- Thanks.
- Good as new.

11:21.673 --> 11:24.466
Saves me a big explanation to Lori.

11:24.928 --> 11:27.395
How's it going over there?

11:27.503 --> 11:28.690
It's not bad.

11:28.715 --> 11:31.992
You know, I don't bother her,
she doesn't bother me, so...

11:33.845 --> 11:35.944
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:35.969 --> 11:37.695
Where have you been?

11:38.672 --> 11:41.007
I'm just gonna put this away.

11:41.032 --> 11:42.328
See ya.

11:45.630 --> 11:47.543
- Hey.
- Hi.

11:47.568 --> 11:49.304
Um...

11:49.329 --> 11:51.383
I've been really wanting to talk to you.

11:51.408 --> 11:55.252
Yeah, I, uh, I got your 87 messages.

11:56.825 --> 11:59.178
I'm sorry for what I said.

11:59.203 --> 12:01.319
I should have never accused you like that.

12:01.344 --> 12:02.859
It's fine.

12:03.480 --> 12:05.528
I'm, uh, I'm sorry, too.

12:05.553 --> 12:08.186
I should have texted you back.

12:08.273 --> 12:10.596
I tried on his watch.

12:10.621 --> 12:12.339
Okay, I just...

12:12.364 --> 12:14.520
I wanted to know what it would feel like.

12:14.545 --> 12:16.462
You know, how much bigger
his wrists are than mine,

12:16.487 --> 12:18.051
so I should have told you, but...

12:18.076 --> 12:20.026
No, it's fine.

12:20.519 --> 12:22.235
Does Lori know you're okay?

12:22.260 --> 12:23.508
No, not yet.

12:23.533 --> 12:24.409
You should call her, Ben.

12:24.434 --> 12:25.984
She's really worried about you.

12:26.185 --> 12:27.184
Well, this is new.

12:27.209 --> 12:29.257
Since when are you two so close?

12:29.612 --> 12:30.911
We're not close.

12:30.936 --> 12:32.552
We both just care about you.

12:32.577 --> 12:34.251
Is there something wrong with that?

12:34.276 --> 12:37.047
No. Just might take some getting used to.

12:39.654 --> 12:43.278
So, um, where were you?

12:43.303 --> 12:45.799
Gabe and I hit Atlantic City.

12:46.331 --> 12:48.577
- You and Gabe?
- Yeah.

12:48.602 --> 12:50.337
Wow, that's perfect, I should have guessed.

12:50.362 --> 12:52.128
There's like nowhere to party in this town.

12:52.153 --> 12:54.044
They actually have real
nightlife down there.

12:54.390 --> 12:57.171
They've got clubs open 24 hours.

12:57.196 --> 13:00.231
Great DJs. Gambling.

13:00.603 --> 13:01.983
Did you make any money?

13:02.008 --> 13:03.340
No, I broke even.

13:03.365 --> 13:04.709
You never really make money gambling.

13:04.734 --> 13:06.184
Oh, that's a shame.

13:06.209 --> 13:08.266
I could have used a good
angle right about now.

13:08.291 --> 13:09.457
What kind of angle?

13:09.482 --> 13:11.242
It's just a situation at work.

13:11.268 --> 13:14.436
Kind of got to figure out
how to make some quick cash.

13:14.689 --> 13:17.390
Look, there's no trick to making
money other than figuring out

13:17.415 --> 13:19.386
what people want and giving it to them.

13:19.790 --> 13:22.290
At a cost, of course.

13:23.009 --> 13:26.010
I knew there was a reason I
wanted to keep you around.

13:37.740 --> 13:39.807
Look, I don't want to
make a big deal, okay?

13:39.832 --> 13:41.749
I'm back, it's just been a long day.

13:41.774 --> 13:43.274
I'm glad you're home.

13:43.299 --> 13:44.686
Thanks.

13:44.711 --> 13:47.062
For the record, I apologize again.

13:47.088 --> 13:49.399
Seriously, I just...  I want to sleep.

13:49.424 --> 13:50.556
Okay, is that cool?

13:50.581 --> 13:51.664
There's one thing you should know.

13:51.689 --> 13:53.724
Your social worker has been calling.

13:53.749 --> 13:56.163
She set up a home study
visit for Sunday night.

13:56.198 --> 13:57.794
Yeah, I'm familiar.

13:57.819 --> 14:00.734
- Well, you need to be here.
- I know. Carter told me.

14:00.759 --> 14:03.794
- You talked to Carter?
- Yep.

14:04.657 --> 14:06.930
You do understand what's at stake

14:06.955 --> 14:08.770
if you mess up our situation here.

14:08.795 --> 14:10.393
Yeah.

14:10.721 --> 14:14.626
Tonight, actually, for the
first time since I've been here.

14:25.184 --> 14:27.256
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:27.290 --> 14:28.542
Busy?

14:28.567 --> 14:31.127
Oh, just basking in the
joy of writing paychecks.

14:31.152 --> 14:34.089
Speaking of, here's yours.

14:34.114 --> 14:35.834
- Keep it.
- What?

14:35.859 --> 14:38.443
Seriously, I have a proposition for you.

14:38.468 --> 14:41.219
Oh, a proposition. I
like the sound of that.

14:41.244 --> 14:42.466
Calm down.

14:42.491 --> 14:44.889
I figured out a way we
can make some extra cash.

14:44.914 --> 14:47.819
All right, Carter, when I told
you about my little rent issue,

14:47.844 --> 14:49.338
that was out of line.

14:49.363 --> 14:51.671
I didn't mean to make you feel
like that was your problem.

14:51.697 --> 14:54.186
No. Look, I love this place, too.

14:54.211 --> 14:56.378
I even occasionally like my boss.

14:56.403 --> 14:58.858
- Just occasionally?
- Mm.

14:58.883 --> 15:00.717
Here's the thing, though.

15:00.742 --> 15:02.275
Magic Hour's a great place to, like,

15:02.300 --> 15:03.798
hang out and have a drink, right?

15:03.823 --> 15:05.456
But you gotta close at a certain time.

15:05.481 --> 15:07.372
And don't you always
hear people talking about

15:07.397 --> 15:08.809
how they want to keep going,

15:08.834 --> 15:12.244
maybe find somewhere to keep
partying, maybe dance a little?

15:12.269 --> 15:13.935
You mean like an afterhours.

15:13.960 --> 15:16.086
Yeah.

15:17.240 --> 15:20.054
So what exactly do you have in mind?

15:22.602 --> 15:25.782
You know, the police put up
police tape for a reason.

15:25.807 --> 15:27.650
Don't be a wuss.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.538
It's just sitting here completely abandoned

15:30.563 --> 15:34.034
while the city figures out
what to do with it next.

15:34.059 --> 15:36.561
How do you know about it?

15:36.586 --> 15:40.122
I have a secret police informant.

15:42.342 --> 15:43.605
Okay.

15:43.630 --> 15:46.511
But imagine with lights and music

15:46.536 --> 15:49.241
and art from my friend Bird.

15:49.266 --> 15:52.484
We can put a DJ booth up there
and a bar in one of the corners.

15:52.509 --> 15:55.236
Carter, I'm barely making
rent at Magic Hour.

15:55.261 --> 15:57.188
How am I supposed to afford another venue?

15:57.213 --> 15:59.561
Oh, we're not buying it.
We're not renting it.

15:59.586 --> 16:01.836
I'm just talking about one night.

16:01.861 --> 16:04.279
- We're in and then we're out.
- A guerilla rave?

16:04.304 --> 16:06.658
Mm-hmm, and we can charge
whatever we want as cover.

16:06.683 --> 16:07.755
One night? Who's gonna come?

16:07.780 --> 16:09.509
How are people even
gonna find out about it?

16:09.533 --> 16:10.971
Well, that's my department.

16:10.997 --> 16:13.116
Make sure we have booze and the bartenders,

16:13.141 --> 16:15.204
and, like, a sound system and security.

16:15.229 --> 16:17.707
And I will make sure we have a crowd

16:17.732 --> 16:19.720
and a DJ that will blow this place up.

16:19.784 --> 16:22.028
I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be...

16:22.251 --> 16:24.596
impressed by you or terrified.

16:24.621 --> 16:26.253
A little of both.

16:26.278 --> 16:28.228
Is that a yes?

16:29.039 --> 16:31.061
Yes.

16:34.926 --> 16:36.712
Okay.

16:36.861 --> 16:41.647
This is either really
smart or really stupid.

16:43.219 --> 16:46.864
And to the left is our art room
with a new kiln for ceramics

16:46.889 --> 16:49.102
and a darkroom for developing photography.

16:49.126 --> 16:52.031
Darkrooms are also really
good places for making out

16:52.056 --> 16:54.134
'cause no one will walk in you unannounced.

16:54.159 --> 16:55.575
Just don't skip class.

16:56.070 --> 16:57.390
I won't.

16:57.415 --> 16:59.600
To the left is the administration suite,

16:59.626 --> 17:01.640
teachers' lounge, school counselor's room

17:01.665 --> 17:02.792
and principal's office.

17:02.816 --> 17:04.327
Usually has the best snacks.

17:04.352 --> 17:05.351
Check.

17:05.949 --> 17:08.119
- Oh, God.
- What?

17:08.145 --> 17:10.232
- It's Reagan.
- Who's Reagan?

17:10.257 --> 17:11.271
Hey, Grant.

17:11.297 --> 17:14.287
Hey. Reagan. Random.

17:14.311 --> 17:15.627
Not so random.

17:15.653 --> 17:17.323
I'll be in high school next year, too.

17:17.348 --> 17:19.372
Where else would I go?

17:19.953 --> 17:21.228
Right.

17:21.252 --> 17:23.828
I didn't mean random, I meant...

17:24.269 --> 17:25.519
funny.

17:25.544 --> 17:27.971
Uh, Mr. Wilson? Let's keep up, please.

17:27.996 --> 17:30.863
Uh, I'll see you around, I guess.

17:30.888 --> 17:32.342
Good seeing you, Grant.

17:32.367 --> 17:34.518
Bye, Reagan.

17:34.684 --> 17:36.760
Okay, tell me that wasn't
as awkward as it felt.

17:36.785 --> 17:40.110
We got a little work to do.

17:43.533 --> 17:45.605
Okay, I have been timing you,

17:45.630 --> 17:49.584
and you have been organizing
your briefcase for over an hour.

17:49.609 --> 17:51.672
I'm having second
thoughts about taking off.

17:51.697 --> 17:52.896
Book tour remorse?

17:52.921 --> 17:54.287
There's a lot going on around here.

17:54.312 --> 17:56.423
And that thing with Gabe and Ben?

17:56.448 --> 17:57.908
That didn't ease my mind.

17:57.933 --> 17:58.888
Honey, I know.

17:58.913 --> 18:01.793
It's difficult to leave, but you know what?

18:01.818 --> 18:04.648
I'm starting to feel okay about Ben.

18:04.673 --> 18:06.640
I think he's warming up to us.

18:06.814 --> 18:08.313
Gabe, on the other hand...

18:08.338 --> 18:10.529
No, that'll take time, Liz.

18:10.554 --> 18:13.004
He blames me for Kyle's death.

18:13.688 --> 18:15.321
It's written all over his face.

18:15.346 --> 18:17.200
He needs to grieve.

18:20.662 --> 18:24.768
Are you gonna be okay with me
on the road for two months?

18:25.028 --> 18:26.610
Yes.

18:26.635 --> 18:28.920
It's just... You know,
it's part of the package.

18:28.945 --> 18:31.232
Being married to a successful author.

18:31.257 --> 18:33.409
It'll fly by.

18:34.616 --> 18:36.048
You're a good wife.

18:36.073 --> 18:37.240
Mm-hmm.

18:37.265 --> 18:38.800
And mother.

18:38.825 --> 18:41.544
And friend.

18:43.298 --> 18:46.152
I noticed you didn't say cook.

18:46.698 --> 18:50.065
Three out of four isn't bad.

18:52.262 --> 18:53.561
Good seeing you.

18:53.586 --> 18:54.856
Good seeing you, that's what she said?

18:54.881 --> 18:56.289
- Yep.
- Tell me the truth.

18:56.314 --> 18:57.563
Is that more like...

18:57.588 --> 19:00.764
genuine good seeing you,
or, like, dismissive?

19:00.789 --> 19:03.063
I think that sounded genuine.

19:03.491 --> 19:04.723
'Cause I couldn't really tell.

19:04.748 --> 19:06.926
I mean, the way she said
my name made it sound like

19:06.951 --> 19:08.539
it was more dismissive,

19:08.564 --> 19:09.712
like, she was saying
good-bye, as opposed to...

19:09.737 --> 19:13.033
Grant, you're gonna stroke out
about this. You gotta chill.

19:13.058 --> 19:14.126
Yeah, you're right.

19:14.151 --> 19:15.389
How does she do it, you know?

19:15.414 --> 19:17.806
Just get me so crazy.

19:17.831 --> 19:19.558
I think you're doing it to yourself.

19:19.583 --> 19:21.867
It was pretty clear to me Reagan
was really happy to see you, dude.

19:21.892 --> 19:24.104
And if you're unsure about that,
then you always just call her.

19:24.129 --> 19:27.173
A call? Like, talking on the phone?

19:27.198 --> 19:30.396
It's 2015. Anything more
than a Snapchat is stalking.

19:30.926 --> 19:32.454
Just text her.

19:32.479 --> 19:34.009
Text? Yes.

19:34.034 --> 19:35.831
Great, that's good.

19:35.856 --> 19:38.323
"Hey, good seeing you.

19:38.348 --> 19:40.943
Let's FaceTime soon."

19:41.139 --> 19:43.632
It's casual, yet direct. Nice.

19:43.657 --> 19:48.306
How is offering to FaceTime
less intimidating than calling?

19:48.893 --> 19:51.712
Oh. You're right. You're totally right.

19:51.737 --> 19:53.322
What was I thinking? I'm a mess.

19:53.347 --> 19:54.942
Oh, relax, it's all right.

19:54.967 --> 19:56.664
Wait, wait, look, look, look, look.

19:56.689 --> 19:59.313
- She's texting back.
- See? No problems, man.

20:01.149 --> 20:03.534
And the lights are gonna
be synched to the music,

20:03.559 --> 20:05.943
so we're gonna have this,
like, cool strobing effect.

20:05.968 --> 20:07.873
Ooh. What if no one shows?

20:07.898 --> 20:10.593
Oh, come on. Instagram, Snapchat, Vine.

20:10.618 --> 20:11.773
Everyone's on notice.

20:11.798 --> 20:13.275
Well, my phone's already blowing up.

20:13.300 --> 20:16.084
I just have to make sure people
have a good time when they show up.

20:16.109 --> 20:17.555
Which they will.

20:17.580 --> 20:19.806
'Cause you're totally doing this right.

20:19.831 --> 20:21.556
Thanks. I hope so.

20:21.581 --> 20:23.230
Jared kinda needs this.

20:23.478 --> 20:27.262
You know, every time you say
his name, you blush, right?

20:29.223 --> 20:31.256
What's going on?

20:31.281 --> 20:33.051
Um, we, uh...

20:33.076 --> 20:35.239
We kind of kissed.

20:35.264 --> 20:36.513
And?

20:36.538 --> 20:38.194
And it was pretty amazing.

20:38.219 --> 20:40.730
I feel like everyone says that
when they kiss someone new.

20:40.755 --> 20:42.770
No. This was different.

20:42.795 --> 20:44.771
I don't know, maybe 'cause he's older,

20:44.795 --> 20:46.273
more experienced or something.

20:46.298 --> 20:48.548
It just felt right. I can't
stop thinking about it.

20:48.573 --> 20:49.802
Ugh, jealous.

20:49.827 --> 20:51.970
I can't even remember the
last time I kissed like that.

20:51.995 --> 20:54.879
Yeah, good kissers are
surprisingly hard to come by.

20:54.904 --> 20:56.782
Most guys our age are like...

20:56.807 --> 20:58.309
So sloppy.

20:58.334 --> 21:00.512
Yeah, or, like, really careful and awkward.

21:00.537 --> 21:01.799
And they make you feel
like you're making out

21:01.824 --> 21:03.305
with a water hose or a piece of cardboard.

21:03.330 --> 21:04.470
Ew.

21:04.881 --> 21:07.012
I'm just trying to figure
out if I have to tell him

21:07.037 --> 21:09.278
how old I really am before
we do anything else.

21:09.303 --> 21:12.342
I don't want to put him in a bad position.

21:12.367 --> 21:13.862
No pun intended.

21:13.887 --> 21:15.887
Okay, well, why tell?

21:15.912 --> 21:17.939
I mean, what he doesn't
know can't hurt him.

21:17.964 --> 21:21.478
But a relationship built
on less than the truth...

21:21.503 --> 21:23.775
Wait, who said anything
about a relationship?

21:23.800 --> 21:27.031
Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

21:38.166 --> 21:41.015
(car engine starting)

22:11.919 --> 22:13.475
You should not be here.

22:13.499 --> 22:15.890
I know that, David. Do you
think I want to be here?

22:16.318 --> 22:18.151
What's the matter? Ben all right?

22:18.176 --> 22:20.640
Yes. But I need your help.

22:20.672 --> 22:23.744
- What's going on?
- Um...

22:24.182 --> 22:27.554
His social worker is doing
a home study tomorrow.

22:27.579 --> 22:30.250
She wants to make sure
that I'm a fit parent,

22:30.275 --> 22:32.916
and given recent circumstances,
I need things to go well.

22:32.941 --> 22:34.205
Well, what do you want me to do?

22:34.230 --> 22:37.314
I think it would really help
my case if you were there.

22:37.339 --> 22:38.839
To show a united front,

22:38.864 --> 22:42.265
to prove that you see me
as a fit parent for Ben.

22:42.461 --> 22:44.626
Even though he lives with
me, you're still his father,

22:44.651 --> 22:45.867
and that counts for a lot,

22:45.892 --> 22:48.411
especially in our...  unusual situation.

22:48.436 --> 22:50.267
This is not a good idea.

22:50.292 --> 22:52.954
If this doesn't go well, I could lose him.

22:54.832 --> 22:57.542
- Maybe that's what you want.
- No, I don't want that.

22:57.567 --> 23:00.759
He could go back into the
system if that happens.

23:01.234 --> 23:04.422
But I'm in a very awkward situation here.

23:04.447 --> 23:07.286
Elizabeth wouldn't like it.

23:07.674 --> 23:09.224
Then don't tell her.

23:09.249 --> 23:10.415
I'm not gonna lie to her.

23:10.440 --> 23:12.837
David, please. It's for Ben.

23:14.651 --> 23:17.936
Dude, you are gonna fry your
corneas staring at that thing.

23:17.961 --> 23:20.203
Come on, it's been two
hours and those little dots

23:20.228 --> 23:21.677
are still there just taunting me.

23:21.873 --> 23:24.011
I mean, you think it's bad,
the text she's sending?

23:24.036 --> 23:25.519
Give me the phone.

23:25.544 --> 23:27.276
No.

23:28.046 --> 23:29.462
Dude, give me the phone.

23:29.498 --> 23:31.969
No. Not until I get a text back.

23:31.994 --> 23:34.719
Have you ever heard the phrase
that the watched pot never boils?

23:34.744 --> 23:36.410
No.

23:36.768 --> 23:38.923
Do you think that a girl
is gonna want to hang out

23:38.948 --> 23:41.153
with some dude who's only interest is her?

23:41.178 --> 23:42.489
Come on, I have two sisters.

23:42.514 --> 23:44.515
I know girls love being
the center of attention.

23:44.540 --> 23:45.675
Yeah. They want to be
the center of attention

23:45.699 --> 23:47.795
from a guy who has his own life.

23:48.249 --> 23:50.833
Fine. Tell me what to do.

23:51.412 --> 23:53.499
You play your video games.

23:53.524 --> 23:54.936
You focus on what makes you tick.

23:54.961 --> 23:56.741
That's what's gonna make
a girl really like you.

23:56.766 --> 23:58.065
How am I supposed to concentrate

23:58.090 --> 23:59.693
if I can't even get a girl to text me back?

23:59.718 --> 24:03.149
Meditate. Little woosah, some breathwork.

24:03.723 --> 24:06.160
And somehow you get through it.

24:06.593 --> 24:09.164
I gotta go see Taylor.

24:09.326 --> 24:10.867
Stay off the phone, okay?

24:10.892 --> 24:13.427
You focus on you and
you keep focusing on you

24:13.452 --> 24:15.365
until you hear from her.

24:15.934 --> 24:18.465
Hey, you keep focusing
on you even if you don't.

24:18.490 --> 24:20.412
You think I won't?

24:21.180 --> 24:23.726
No phone.

24:24.699 --> 24:26.741
Got it.

24:29.358 --> 24:31.950
(people shouting)

24:34.649 --> 24:37.068
(DJ playing music)

24:41.953 --> 24:44.069
(cheering)

24:56.861 --> 24:58.630
- Hey!
- Hey!

24:58.655 --> 25:00.670
This is beyond, babe, you did it.

25:00.694 --> 25:02.913
No, come on, we did it.
This was a team effort.

25:02.939 --> 25:06.223
So, where'd you find the DJ? He's insane.

25:06.248 --> 25:10.325
Oh, just a lucky break.
His name's Seth something.

25:10.349 --> 25:12.492
He just got back from a
tour of the west coast.

25:12.517 --> 25:14.796
Maybe I should let you
figure that out for yourself.

25:14.821 --> 25:16.828
Well, don't mind if I do.

25:17.196 --> 25:20.380
- What did you do?
- This is amazing!

25:20.405 --> 25:22.235
- This is incredible.
- Thanks, yeah.

25:22.260 --> 25:23.483
I can't believe the turnout.

25:23.508 --> 25:25.342
Looks like everyone's having fun, right?

25:25.367 --> 25:26.586
Yeah, I think so.

25:26.612 --> 25:28.236
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:28.261 --> 25:33.303
Um, Taylor, Max, this is Jared. My boss.

25:33.542 --> 25:35.456
Nice to meet you.

25:35.481 --> 25:37.431
- This is a great party.
- Not bad, eh?

25:37.456 --> 25:38.601
No, not bad at all.

25:38.626 --> 25:40.416
We've already made more money tonight

25:40.441 --> 25:43.314
than the bar usually makes in a week.

25:43.515 --> 25:45.241
So it's a success?

25:45.266 --> 25:47.665
You're a success.

25:51.772 --> 25:53.369
I gotta get back to it.

25:53.394 --> 25:54.696
Hey, very nice to meet you guys.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.488
Nice to meet you.

25:57.790 --> 25:59.824
Your boss? Huh?

25:59.849 --> 26:01.032
I think he might dig you.

26:01.058 --> 26:03.144
I don't know what to do.

26:03.169 --> 26:06.627
I don't know if it's the
lights or the music or what,

26:06.652 --> 26:09.262
but I kind of dig him, too.

26:09.287 --> 26:10.765
Then what's the problem?

26:10.790 --> 26:14.445
Well, he's 25 and she's
17, and he doesn't know.

26:14.470 --> 26:15.465
Oh.

26:15.491 --> 26:17.189
Yeah, that's weird.

26:17.213 --> 26:19.404
Look, if he likes you,
age shouldn't matter.

26:19.429 --> 26:22.380
Serious?

26:24.352 --> 26:27.805
How all y'all sexy people doing tonight?

26:27.830 --> 26:30.204
(cheering)

26:44.172 --> 26:45.875
I can't believe he's here.

26:45.900 --> 26:48.357
Yesterday, he was in a jail cell.

26:48.381 --> 26:51.563
Can you get us another round?

26:57.582 --> 26:59.256
She's still pissed, huh?

26:59.281 --> 27:01.536
Yeah, yeah, she is, imagine that.

27:01.942 --> 27:04.495
You know, part of me was
hoping that that car wreck

27:04.520 --> 27:05.907
would knock some sense into you.

27:05.932 --> 27:07.310
Give me a break, all right?

27:07.336 --> 27:09.079
I got into a fight. It's
not the end of the world.

27:09.103 --> 27:10.319
Dude, she loves you.

27:10.344 --> 27:12.759
And she cares about you.

27:12.784 --> 27:14.251
If you cared for her at all,

27:14.276 --> 27:16.079
you would get out of here
and get yourself straight.

27:16.105 --> 27:18.541
Being around and treating everybody
like this is not cool for anyone.

27:18.566 --> 27:20.032
Yeah.

27:20.319 --> 27:22.076
I get it.

27:22.102 --> 27:24.624
See ya.

27:44.795 --> 27:48.425
How long does a person's page
stay up after they're gone?

27:48.672 --> 27:50.889
I don't know.

27:57.304 --> 27:59.776
- Thinking about Gabe?
- Yeah.

27:59.801 --> 28:03.443
I just wish I could make
things better with him.

28:04.697 --> 28:06.649
Give it time.

28:07.055 --> 28:09.890
Just look how things are changing with Ben.

28:09.915 --> 28:11.547
Yeah.

28:12.242 --> 28:16.110
I just hope Lori doesn't interfere.

28:16.362 --> 28:19.113
Well, you can't worry about that.

28:19.268 --> 28:22.757
We just have to do our
best to keep him close.

28:23.501 --> 28:25.710
Yeah. You're right.

28:25.735 --> 28:29.883
Just focus on that.

28:31.079 --> 28:36.501
Do whatever it takes to
make sure that happens.

28:46.055 --> 28:47.938
I need some air.

28:47.963 --> 28:49.412
I can't breathe.

28:49.437 --> 28:51.352
Look, man, I don't care what you gotta do,

28:51.377 --> 28:53.871
you gotta find a crowbar, get
the garage door open, okay?

28:53.897 --> 28:55.176
We gotta get some air
in there or something.

28:55.201 --> 28:58.431
Go. Come on.

28:59.997 --> 29:01.675
The windows aren't budging.

29:01.701 --> 29:03.434
We gotta do something, all right?

29:03.459 --> 29:04.618
It's getting too hot in there.

29:04.643 --> 29:06.165
The last thing we need is for
someone to call an ambulance.

29:06.190 --> 29:08.047
Well, can't people just come
outside if they're too hot?

29:08.072 --> 29:10.285
It's packed in there. People
can barely move, okay?

29:10.310 --> 29:11.688
Look, we gotta figure something out or...

29:11.713 --> 29:13.573
I'm gonna shut this thing down.

29:13.598 --> 29:17.765
Okay, just give me a minute.

29:29.474 --> 29:31.528
Hey.

29:31.553 --> 29:33.687
(indistinct chatter)

29:33.722 --> 29:35.282
- Feeling all right?
- I need some air.

29:35.307 --> 29:38.637
We're about one stampede
away from serious trouble.

29:38.662 --> 29:40.445
Yeah.

29:41.984 --> 29:45.781
Tell Seth to keep an eye on me.

29:45.806 --> 29:49.061
(whispering, indistinct)

29:49.977 --> 29:53.527
(clapping)

30:04.022 --> 30:06.661
(cheering)

30:38.851 --> 30:41.470
(lock turning)

31:42.378 --> 31:45.994
All right. We're gonna head out.

31:46.019 --> 31:48.019
Great work with those sprinklers.

31:48.044 --> 31:49.051
Uh, thanks.

31:49.077 --> 31:50.621
Great work with those beats.

31:50.646 --> 31:51.597
This is a good venue.

31:51.622 --> 31:52.640
Let me know when you throw the next one.

31:52.665 --> 31:54.091
Yeah, sure.

31:54.116 --> 31:56.232
- All right, love you, babe.
- Yeah, bye.

31:56.257 --> 31:58.637
BT-dub, the DJ knows how to kiss.

32:00.015 --> 32:02.922
Bye.

32:07.447 --> 32:09.998
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:10.032 --> 32:12.284
I didn't even know you were here.

32:12.309 --> 32:13.364
Thanks for coming.

32:13.389 --> 32:15.067
Yeah, it's...  It's a great party.

32:15.092 --> 32:16.889
Good enough to keep you in town?

32:16.914 --> 32:18.531
I'm not sure about that.

32:18.556 --> 32:22.291
You're gonna show up tomorrow for
the home study visit, though, right?

32:22.316 --> 32:23.695
Yeah, I don't know, Carter.

32:23.720 --> 32:25.750
Maybe I should just teach her a lesson

32:25.775 --> 32:28.143
about going through my stuff.

32:28.416 --> 32:30.542
Why is it so important to you?

32:30.567 --> 32:32.919
It's not.

32:32.944 --> 32:35.520
You are.

32:42.444 --> 32:44.177
All right, great work, everyone.

32:44.202 --> 32:45.746
There you go.

32:51.405 --> 32:54.063
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:54.088 --> 32:56.825
So? How'd we do?

32:56.850 --> 32:59.114
Well, you remember that
paycheck you told me to keep?

32:59.138 --> 33:01.569
Uh, not keep, invest.

33:01.594 --> 33:03.811
Yeah, well, now it's four times as big.

33:03.836 --> 33:06.755
And what about the bar?

33:06.780 --> 33:09.280
We're gonna have no trouble
paying rent this month.

33:09.305 --> 33:10.960
People are already blowing up my phone,

33:10.985 --> 33:13.496
asking me when the next party is gonna be.

33:13.521 --> 33:15.345
Hey.

33:15.369 --> 33:17.775
What's wrong?

33:18.694 --> 33:20.080
Um...

33:20.105 --> 33:23.849
Okay, there's something I
should probably tell you.

33:24.089 --> 33:25.992
Okay, give it to me straight, Doc.

33:26.017 --> 33:28.048
Rip the Band-Aid off.

33:28.073 --> 33:30.623
What, you got a boyfriend or something?

33:31.206 --> 33:34.123
Um, no.

33:34.148 --> 33:35.536
I don't have a boyfriend.

33:35.561 --> 33:36.512
Well, that's good.

33:36.537 --> 33:39.120
What is it, then?

33:41.529 --> 33:43.096
You know what?

33:43.121 --> 33:44.520
It's nothing, never mind.

33:44.545 --> 33:47.296
I'm just...  Come on, let's go.

33:53.964 --> 33:57.215
(phone buzzing)

34:00.440 --> 34:01.773
Hello?

34:01.798 --> 34:03.669
Sorry I didn't text you back yesterday.

34:03.694 --> 34:05.494
Oh, no, no worries.

34:05.519 --> 34:07.754
It's cool, you know,
just been doing my thing.

34:07.779 --> 34:09.706
Playing video games and stuff.

34:09.731 --> 34:12.554
Well, I'm glad we'll be going
to the same high school.

34:12.580 --> 34:14.235
It'll be fun.

34:14.260 --> 34:16.902
Yeah. Yeah, it'll be great.

34:16.928 --> 34:17.866
<i>I know, right?</i>

34:17.891 --> 34:19.679
We should definitely hang before we start

34:19.705 --> 34:21.170
and compare our schedules.

34:21.196 --> 34:24.248
Maybe we can take some classes together.

34:24.274 --> 34:25.813
Yeah.

34:26.170 --> 34:27.590
I'd love that.

34:28.005 --> 34:29.755
<i>Well, anyway, sounds like you're busy.</i>

34:29.781 --> 34:31.197
I'll let you get back to it.

34:31.222 --> 34:32.445
Text me again sometime.

34:32.469 --> 34:33.753
Oh, I will.

34:33.777 --> 34:36.571
I mean... sure.

34:49.333 --> 34:51.246
Carter, what are you doing here?

34:51.272 --> 34:52.728
Sorry if I'm interrupting.

34:52.754 --> 34:54.253
I just wanted to make sure Ben showed up.

34:54.277 --> 34:56.143
Come in for a minute.

34:57.923 --> 35:01.091
Carter, this is Amanda
Roland, Ben's social worker.

35:01.116 --> 35:02.429
Lovely to meet you, Carter.

35:02.454 --> 35:03.954
And, of course, you know Ben.

35:03.979 --> 35:04.928
Hi.

35:04.953 --> 35:06.235
And last, but not least,

35:06.260 --> 35:09.194
your dad dropped by, too.

35:09.682 --> 35:12.383
What a nice show of support,
everyone being here.

35:12.408 --> 35:14.800
Given the circumstances, it's quite unusual

35:14.824 --> 35:16.606
to see a family come together like this.

35:16.631 --> 35:19.070
You all must really care a
great deal for each other.

35:19.095 --> 35:23.784
Yeah. Yeah, we really do.

35:42.457 --> 35:44.254
What are you doing here?

35:44.279 --> 35:45.745
I need to talk to you.

35:45.780 --> 35:48.948
Fine. Talk.

35:54.624 --> 35:56.816
I've made some mistakes lately,

35:56.841 --> 35:58.362
which I think we both know why.

35:58.387 --> 36:00.387
But the biggest mistake that I made

36:00.412 --> 36:03.319
is not telling you the truth
about something really important,

36:03.344 --> 36:06.074
which is how I feel about you.

36:06.099 --> 36:08.956
There are some things that
I had never said before,

36:08.981 --> 36:11.282
things that I should have
said a long time ago.

36:11.308 --> 36:13.525
Gabe, please stop.

36:13.634 --> 36:15.240
I'm with Max.

36:15.265 --> 36:19.746
There's nothing that you can
say that's gonna change that.

36:21.320 --> 36:25.138
So, I had a shot, once upon a time,

36:25.163 --> 36:28.114
I missed it and that's that.

36:28.770 --> 36:31.969
I don't know what to tell you.

36:33.201 --> 36:35.379
Well, just so you know,

36:35.404 --> 36:38.188
I'm really sorry for the
way that I've been acting.

36:38.213 --> 36:39.963
I'm going to be better.

36:39.988 --> 36:44.373
Thank you. I appreciate that.

36:50.395 --> 36:52.004
You're the man of the house now.

36:52.029 --> 36:53.389
You know what that means.

36:53.414 --> 36:55.739
Yeah, yeah, whatever. Just
make sure to not watch

36:55.764 --> 36:57.263
any of the new "Walking Deads" without me.

36:57.288 --> 36:59.032
I promise.

37:01.759 --> 37:04.176
Oh, I'm gonna miss your cooking.

37:04.201 --> 37:06.840
I see more cookies in your future.

37:08.234 --> 37:11.235
- Thanks.
- Bye.

37:13.353 --> 37:14.917
Bye.

37:14.942 --> 37:17.171
Thank you.

37:17.594 --> 37:19.570
For everything.

37:20.501 --> 37:22.688
You've really stepped up.

37:22.713 --> 37:25.540
You, too.

37:25.565 --> 37:27.770
Okay, everyone, clear out.

37:27.795 --> 37:30.914
Give your dad and me a moment alone.

37:38.097 --> 37:39.892
I'll call you every night.

37:39.917 --> 37:41.667
I'll answer every night.

37:41.692 --> 37:43.408
I love you.

37:43.433 --> 37:45.509
Even for the things we disagree about.

37:45.534 --> 37:47.033
That's why I keep you around.

37:47.058 --> 37:50.350
I guess that's a little
ironic right now, huh?

37:56.408 --> 37:58.241
I'll get the door.

37:58.266 --> 37:59.899
Yeah.

38:02.539 --> 38:05.108
I'll be back before you know it.

38:05.133 --> 38:07.390
I'll be here.

38:50.987 --> 38:55.894

38:55.919 --> 39:00.222

39:00.247 --> 39:03.081
What's wrong? Where'd you go?

39:03.106 --> 39:05.180
Hmm?

39:05.205 --> 39:07.547
You remember when I said

39:07.572 --> 39:10.042
there was something I
should probably tell you?

39:10.067 --> 39:13.314
Yeah, you mean when you
almost gave me a heart attack?

39:15.869 --> 39:18.639
Jared, I'm not 21.

39:19.446 --> 39:21.363
I'm 17.

39:22.362 --> 39:25.113
I used a fake I.D. to get my job here,

39:25.138 --> 39:27.069
and I'm so sorry I didn't
tell you about it before,

39:27.094 --> 39:28.711
but I wouldn't be telling
you this now if I didn't...

39:28.736 --> 39:31.827
No, no. No, stop, okay? Stop.

39:32.914 --> 39:35.114
You're 17?

39:35.139 --> 39:37.570
I know, and I'm sorry
I lied about it, but...

39:37.595 --> 39:41.307
You liked me when you thought
I was just a little bit older.

39:41.332 --> 39:43.762
Why do a few years have to
make such a big difference?

39:43.787 --> 39:44.666
Because it does.

39:44.692 --> 39:47.882
Because that makes a huge difference.

39:48.360 --> 39:51.131
You need...  You need to go.

39:51.194 --> 39:52.811
What? Jared.

39:52.836 --> 39:54.882
Just give me a minute, okay?

39:58.723 --> 40:00.607
I'm still the same person.

40:00.632 --> 40:01.467
No, you're not.

40:01.492 --> 40:04.040
Your underage, Carter. You're 17 years old.

40:04.065 --> 40:05.898
This is crazy.

40:06.063 --> 40:09.019
Do you have any idea what kind
of situation you got me in?

40:09.044 --> 40:11.377
No.

40:13.372 --> 40:17.368
I'm... sorry.

40:18.133 --> 40:20.834
You need to go.

40:22.524 --> 40:24.560
Now.

40:31.663 --> 40:34.280
(sniffles)

40:35.046 --> 40:40.349
I never meant to get
involved with you, or to lie.

40:40.374 --> 40:42.487
It just happened.

40:44.867 --> 40:48.429
And I'm only telling
you this now because...

40:50.567 --> 40:53.297
Because I really care about you.

Next time on "Finding Carter... "

41:02.004 --> 41:03.929
You are stealing from my boss.

41:03.954 --> 41:05.396
Don't mess with me.

41:05.421 --> 41:06.838
Carter?

41:06.863 --> 41:09.349
I don't want you working there anymore.

41:09.374 --> 41:10.573
It's not your call.

41:10.598 --> 41:11.667
The parties are over.

41:11.693 --> 41:12.547
Have you seen Taylor?

41:12.572 --> 41:14.689
Gabe told me that he has feelings for me.

41:16.428 --> 41:18.166
Taylor.

41:18.191 --> 41:20.547
You have no idea what you just did.
