02:00.485 --> 02:01.486
Jean?

02:03.321 --> 02:04.406
Jean?

02:05.782 --> 02:08.410
I was just asking if you want
an iced coffee? Cappuccino?

02:08.493 --> 02:11.053
We got the new Nespresso machine.
It can literally make anything.

02:11.079 --> 02:13.748
Oh, thanks, but I'm
actually trying to quit.

02:13.832 --> 02:15.112
I find it doesn't agree with me.

02:15.166 --> 02:17.377
Maria makes this great
ginger turmeric drink.

02:17.460 --> 02:18.753
It's really good for the skin.

02:19.087 --> 02:20.964
I figure it's a better
alternative to Botox.

02:24.718 --> 02:26.720
- Oh...
- They're fine.

02:26.803 --> 02:29.556
Relax, Jean. It's so funny
what you choose to worry about.

02:32.267 --> 02:35.729
Actually, I noticed you haven't
RSVP'd to Dolly's party yet.

02:35.812 --> 02:37.856
Oh, fuck, I'm so sorry. I meant to.

02:37.939 --> 02:39.107
No, it's fine.

02:39.190 --> 02:41.067
I just know how much
she wants Sadie there,

02:41.151 --> 02:43.611
and once she gets her mind
set on something...

02:43.695 --> 02:44.904
What's your theme?

02:46.030 --> 02:49.909
We don't have a theme,
but we're gonna have a magician.

02:50.493 --> 02:51.493
Oh.

02:53.204 --> 02:54.724
Sadie's always been such a girly-girl,

02:54.789 --> 02:56.499
so it's pretty
straight-forward, thank God.

02:56.583 --> 02:59.335
You know, princesses, Frozen.

02:59.919 --> 03:02.172
Oh, but I do have the best
caterer if you need someone.

03:02.255 --> 03:03.423
And it's not Holly Faitelson.

03:04.424 --> 03:06.760
We're just gonna do pizza and cake.

03:07.594 --> 03:08.887
Oh, that's good.

03:09.637 --> 03:12.477
It's refreshing to see someone not
get carried away with a lavish party.

03:14.434 --> 03:15.560
Where's the bathroom?

03:15.644 --> 03:18.355
Just use mine down the hall.
The workmen have been using this one,

03:18.438 --> 03:21.399
and they leave the toilet seat up
all the time, it's disgusting.

04:20.750 --> 04:23.002
Hey, come on, Dolly, let's go.

04:23.586 --> 04:24.837
I'm coming, Mom.

04:25.713 --> 04:28.675
- Thanks. We'll see you Saturday?
- Yeah.

04:29.884 --> 04:33.680
Oh, and if you end up needing someone,
Daphne's Catering, ask for Milana.

04:33.763 --> 04:36.349
- Seriously life changing.
- Okay, thanks.

04:37.058 --> 04:38.058
I got to ride...

04:39.728 --> 04:41.730
Dolly, you know the rules.

04:41.813 --> 04:43.440
Please, just one game.

04:43.523 --> 04:45.358
No. Upstairs, please.

04:46.192 --> 04:47.569
Start your homework.

04:48.194 --> 04:49.612
I'll be right up, honey.

05:03.335 --> 05:07.047
Hi, Jean.
I have been trying to get a hold of you.

05:07.130 --> 05:10.342
I wanted to see what you guys
were doing for Dolly's birthday.

05:10.425 --> 05:12.177
Um, please call me back,

05:12.260 --> 05:16.014
if you can spare the time, that is,
for your mother, thanks.

05:16.097 --> 05:17.098
Love you.

05:39.371 --> 05:40.372
Hey!

05:40.455 --> 05:42.666
I've been stuck in meetings.
How did it go?

05:42.749 --> 05:45.377
Good. Sadie's definitely
in for the party.

05:45.460 --> 05:46.795
Well, is Doll happy?

05:46.878 --> 05:48.964
- What do you think?
- Aw, I bet.

05:49.673 --> 05:52.550
Oh, listen, I got
Stacey to come tonight.

05:53.468 --> 05:54.761
You wanna go out?

05:54.844 --> 05:57.430
Actually, I was thinking
we could meet in the city,

05:57.514 --> 05:59.975
have some dinner, like old times.

06:00.392 --> 06:02.394
Oh, is this a date?

06:02.477 --> 06:03.728
Maybe.

06:05.021 --> 06:07.148
Well, I'll have Alexis book something.

06:07.649 --> 06:09.401
No, I already took care of it.

06:10.026 --> 06:11.444
I'll text you the address.

06:11.528 --> 06:13.989
Wow, you are on it tonight.

06:14.489 --> 06:18.743
- You have no idea.
- Wow, bye.

06:39.681 --> 06:41.891
I'm telling you,
you didn't pay the check.

06:41.975 --> 06:45.020
- No... yes, I did.
- How much do you want to bet?

06:45.103 --> 06:46.980
You already have a pretty big tab.

06:47.063 --> 06:49.649
Shut up. You're just saying
that 'cause you're wrong.

06:50.483 --> 06:54.404
If anything, I might have
pretended to be a rebel

06:54.487 --> 06:55.905
- just to impress you.
- No...

06:55.989 --> 06:57.907
But I would have never
walked out on the bill.

06:57.991 --> 06:59.117
- Listen to me.
- Ever.

06:59.200 --> 07:00.869
- You were wasted.
- You're wasted.

07:00.952 --> 07:03.079
It was Greg's 30th.
We all just literally walked out.

07:03.204 --> 07:05.581
- You are wasted.
- I swear,

07:05.665 --> 07:08.627
if you don't look suspicious,
people never suspect anything.

07:15.425 --> 07:18.553
- Bored there, Jeanie?
- I love when you call me that.

07:21.598 --> 07:23.224
- Excuse me?
- Yes, Ma'am?

07:23.308 --> 07:25.727
Can I get a tequila on the rocks

07:25.810 --> 07:28.438
with a splash of soda
and extra limes, please?

07:28.521 --> 07:30.565
Really? You've got
an early day tomorrow.

07:30.982 --> 07:32.025
So?

07:32.108 --> 07:34.110
Come on, let's be adventurous.

07:43.912 --> 07:45.592
Come on, you hardly ate anything.

07:45.663 --> 07:47.123
Here, have the last of the pie.

07:48.917 --> 07:50.669
Oh, so I'm picking up the cake tomorrow,

07:50.752 --> 07:53.421
and don't worry,
I avoided pink like the plague.

07:53.504 --> 07:55.381
As long as Dolly's happy.

07:56.048 --> 07:58.176
I can't believe she's nine.

07:58.259 --> 08:00.426
Ah, if I could, I'd
lock her in a freezer

08:00.438 --> 08:02.305
and have her stay that way forever.

08:02.389 --> 08:04.891
Maybe with a little less attitude.

08:05.475 --> 08:06.893
We should've had another one.

08:14.067 --> 08:15.485
Um, have you given any more thought

08:15.568 --> 08:17.248
to inviting your mom
to the birthday party?

08:17.278 --> 08:19.280
Definitely not, she's not coming.

08:19.364 --> 08:22.951
- Hey, don't get upset, okay?
- Okay, sorry.

08:49.936 --> 08:51.396
Let's not go home.

08:52.188 --> 08:54.065
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

08:55.108 --> 08:57.527
I got Stacey to stay till midnight.

08:59.529 --> 09:01.781
You're drunk!

09:02.198 --> 09:05.368
Exactly, and don't ruin it.

09:07.120 --> 09:10.206
Come on, I wanna try this new place.

09:11.499 --> 09:12.626
All right.

09:25.221 --> 09:27.807
- It's cute, right?
- Yeah, how did you find this place?

09:28.224 --> 09:29.517
I have my ways.

09:30.560 --> 09:32.395
So mysterious, huh?

09:33.647 --> 09:35.607
You don't know all my secrets.

09:35.690 --> 09:36.858
Mm, really?

09:36.941 --> 09:39.152
What are you keeping
from me, there, Jeanie?

09:40.320 --> 09:41.863
What are you keeping from me?

09:44.491 --> 09:46.451
Okay, what do you think?
First date or affair?

09:49.704 --> 09:51.289
- Definitely affair.
- Hmm.

09:51.373 --> 09:53.500
Too much passion for a first date.

10:00.256 --> 10:04.094
Do you think I'd know
if you were having an affair?

10:07.180 --> 10:08.431
Well, I would never.

10:11.851 --> 10:15.063
I can't keep anything from you,
so I think you're safe.

10:15.646 --> 10:17.857
One look at your face
and I'd know everything.

10:17.941 --> 10:18.941
Yeah.

10:22.487 --> 10:24.239
What about me?
Do you think I would know?

10:25.782 --> 10:26.782
Hmm.

10:27.409 --> 10:32.539
I think you'd probably pretend
for a while that everything was fine,

10:32.622 --> 10:35.834
and then you'd have
one conversation with me

10:36.668 --> 10:38.503
and then just leave.

10:39.713 --> 10:42.382
That's a very specific response.

10:42.841 --> 10:44.759
I do this for a living, remember?

10:44.843 --> 10:46.511
Well, I hope that never happens.

10:46.594 --> 10:48.722
It won't.

10:50.765 --> 10:52.684
I wouldn't jeopardize this.

10:54.335 --> 10:55.453
You know that, right?

10:59.691 --> 11:04.446
I can't even imagine my life
without you and Dolly.

11:06.114 --> 11:07.866
How far do you think you'd go?

11:09.993 --> 11:11.161
How do you mean?

11:13.204 --> 11:15.290
Emotionally, would you...

11:16.082 --> 11:17.542
would you fight for me?

11:20.920 --> 11:23.173
Of course I would fight for you.

11:24.090 --> 11:25.091
I mean...

11:26.176 --> 11:29.763
take out a knife and threaten
to slit your wrists.

11:30.722 --> 11:32.057
Would you do that?

11:34.142 --> 11:36.311
What the fuck are you talking about?

11:37.187 --> 11:39.147
Anyway, that sounds more like you.

11:42.317 --> 11:43.401
I've grown up.

11:44.235 --> 11:45.362
I think.

11:48.114 --> 11:49.407
Popular tonight.

11:50.408 --> 11:53.119
Oh, it's the caterers.

11:53.203 --> 11:56.247
- You called them already?
- Just for the quote.

12:35.287 --> 12:36.371
Come here.

13:08.611 --> 13:12.032
She's asleep. We're good.

13:13.283 --> 13:17.495
Mm, hey baby, mm...

13:19.205 --> 13:20.664
Keep going.

13:52.613 --> 13:53.739
Don't touch me.

14:04.083 --> 14:07.878
Don't touch. I know exactly what I want.

14:26.731 --> 14:30.694
I felt alone...

14:31.778 --> 14:33.405
outside myself.

14:34.614 --> 14:39.869
And when I woke up, I was turned on.

14:40.537 --> 14:45.667
And whether asleep or trying to, um...

14:47.002 --> 14:48.086
you know,

14:49.254 --> 14:51.506
my mind only goes to her.

14:52.590 --> 14:54.675
You know, I try to
think of other things.

14:55.343 --> 14:58.972
Like, there's this anchor on CNN.

14:59.555 --> 15:02.892
Or Emily, my ex before Sidney,

15:02.976 --> 15:06.771
one time, in Mexico,
in this public hot tub.

15:08.565 --> 15:10.984
But they're always replaced by Sidney.

15:11.901 --> 15:15.237
It doesn't matter how the fantasy
begins. It only ends with her.

15:16.156 --> 15:19.784
Sometimes when we try
to avoid thinking about something,

15:19.868 --> 15:21.870
the more it gets into our head.

15:22.329 --> 15:26.166
So if I tell you not to think
of a red apple, what do you think of?

15:27.792 --> 15:30.420
- A red apple.
- Exactly. See,

15:30.962 --> 15:34.633
by resisting it,
you're actually giving it more power.

15:34.716 --> 15:38.136
The sick thing is that after that dream,

15:38.219 --> 15:43.767
I got off, and when I finished,

15:44.643 --> 15:46.853
I thought of Sidney
with everyone but me.

15:47.853 --> 15:51.232
These douchey guys just fucking her all
at the same time.

15:51.316 --> 15:54.152
It's like some weird form of punishment.

15:56.488 --> 15:59.532
You can't allow Sidney
to have that kind of power over you.

16:00.283 --> 16:03.578
Positive or negative,
you're finding a way to fixate on her.

16:03.662 --> 16:07.707
Both of us, in our sessions,
we're giving it way too much weight.

16:07.791 --> 16:09.751
I know. I agree, but I just...

16:09.834 --> 16:11.878
I don't know how
to keep my mind from going there.

16:11.962 --> 16:14.673
Let's talk about Emily.
What was she like?

16:15.298 --> 16:18.802
Stable and healthy,
not at all adventurous.

16:19.219 --> 16:21.972
But I think that's why
I found Sidney so alluring,

16:22.055 --> 16:23.932
because she was the exact opposite.

16:24.015 --> 16:27.435
Right, but she's also selfish
and dangerous.

16:29.980 --> 16:31.648
From what you said.

16:33.316 --> 16:36.236
Finding someone who loves you
for who you really are,

16:36.653 --> 16:40.282
at your best, at your worst,
that's... that's true love.

16:40.364 --> 16:43.033
Not this constant search for adventure.

16:48.664 --> 16:50.249
I almost forgot.

16:59.759 --> 17:01.094
That's great, Sam.

17:04.431 --> 17:05.265
There you are.

17:05.347 --> 17:09.518
- Yeah, sorry, we ran late.
- You're way too nice.

17:09.601 --> 17:12.646
I see that clock hit 50, I'm like,
"See ya, suckers."

17:12.730 --> 17:14.147
Can you still grab lunch?

17:14.232 --> 17:17.694
I can't. I've got far too much going
on with the party. It's crazy.

17:17.777 --> 17:20.195
God, you're not becoming
a Connecticut mom, are you?

17:20.280 --> 17:22.198
No, that is impossible.

17:22.281 --> 17:26.286
But with the drama at school, I
figured I should make more of an effort.

17:27.037 --> 17:28.622
Try and crack those power moms.

17:28.705 --> 17:30.248
A mother's dream.

17:31.290 --> 17:33.459
Look, you can't fight
Dolly's battles for her

17:33.542 --> 17:36.128
or succumb to their politics.

17:36.211 --> 17:38.756
She'll be fine.
She's a super confident kid.

17:39.341 --> 17:41.217
She'll see through all their crap.

17:41.926 --> 17:44.262
Just like her mother once did.

17:45.597 --> 17:48.683
By the way, you haven't told me
if you're coming tomorrow.

17:48.766 --> 17:50.893
Sorry, a capella practice.

17:51.018 --> 17:52.436
I can't believe that's not a joke.

17:52.519 --> 17:56.648
Wait till you see us perform.
It's like Pitch Perfect on crack.

17:56.732 --> 18:00.027
It's nice to have a community, though.

18:00.611 --> 18:02.821
It's different to go through
life alone, you know?

18:04.658 --> 18:09.162
Yeah, well, I'm just happy
you found your voice.

18:09.995 --> 18:14.500
"Dear Jean, I thought a lot
about my outburst the other day,

18:15.085 --> 18:16.962
about ending therapy.

18:17.045 --> 18:20.048
And what I'm trying to say is
maybe you don't see me

18:20.631 --> 18:22.007
for who I really am.

18:22.091 --> 18:24.760
You see someone strong and steady,

18:24.844 --> 18:28.098
and may not realize
that I look in the mirror

18:28.181 --> 18:30.850
and see the Cowardly Lion.

18:31.643 --> 18:36.481
I know we're not friends, but I
really value our relationship, Jean,

18:36.564 --> 18:37.732
and I'm hurt."

18:40.235 --> 18:41.277
That's it.

18:41.944 --> 18:44.613
- It's a wonderful letter.
- Really?

18:44.696 --> 18:45.696
Hmm.

18:45.740 --> 18:48.368
I was so nervous on
the train coming here.

18:48.868 --> 18:51.663
I kept debating
about this Cowardly Lion part,

18:51.746 --> 18:53.331
I thought maybe it was too much.

18:53.414 --> 18:56.625
And I, uh, I thought maybe
I shouldn't use any metaphors.

18:56.708 --> 18:59.211
No, it's great, really.

18:59.296 --> 19:01.673
And not only because I want you
to be open with me,

19:01.756 --> 19:05.927
but because it's exactly
what I want you to share with Rebecca.

19:06.009 --> 19:07.970
Oh, I'd be such a mess.

19:08.804 --> 19:10.389
Look at my hands, I'm still shaking.

19:12.142 --> 19:15.145
- You know, I've been thinking, Claire.
- Yeah?

19:15.228 --> 19:17.564
With Howard passing,

19:17.646 --> 19:22.276
is it possible you tightened
the reins on Rebecca?

19:22.359 --> 19:24.361
I mean, she's all I've got left.

19:24.446 --> 19:27.324
Right, but it's a lot of pressure
to put on anyone.

19:27.407 --> 19:31.202
After all, you didn't just lose
a husband. Rebecca lost her dad.

19:31.286 --> 19:34.205
And I have a feeling that maybe...

19:34.288 --> 19:38.250
maybe there wasn't enough room
for her grief with yours.

19:39.626 --> 19:43.172
Now, I know how complex
the mother-daughter relationship can be,

19:43.255 --> 19:47.468
but as the mother, you sometimes
have to take responsibility.

19:47.552 --> 19:51.640
You don't want it to get so bad
that she doesn't return your calls

19:51.723 --> 19:54.976
or do anything real with you.

19:57.352 --> 19:58.562
What's your daughter like?

20:00.899 --> 20:07.530
I... I don't usually disclose,
but she's spirited.

20:07.614 --> 20:08.782
Has a mind of her own.

20:08.865 --> 20:11.076
She's actually having a
birthday this weekend.

20:11.159 --> 20:13.203
Oh, how nice. What are you planning?

20:13.286 --> 20:15.413
A princess-themed party.

20:15.497 --> 20:18.375
You know, just your typical
nine-year-old girl.

20:18.458 --> 20:20.293
That's nice, enjoy it.

20:21.378 --> 20:23.296
It's gone in the blink of an eye.

20:24.798 --> 20:26.841
Trust me.

21:06.256 --> 21:08.591
Oh, no, that shouldn't go there.

21:10.302 --> 21:11.803
No one will see it.

21:12.219 --> 21:14.513
It's not for anyone else, Mom.

21:17.100 --> 21:18.518
You know, I...

21:19.144 --> 21:22.314
I don't think you have to have
anybody here, any company, huh?

21:22.396 --> 21:23.605
It's just a transition.

21:25.942 --> 21:29.738
Maybe I don't want company.
Maybe that's the point.

21:31.573 --> 21:34.159
I thought by now
you'd be moving to the suburbs.

21:34.242 --> 21:35.577
Oh, really?

21:35.660 --> 21:39.664
Well, you just don't get me, do you?

21:40.415 --> 21:42.000
That's not who I am.

21:43.126 --> 21:45.420
You don't want to go through life alone.

21:47.004 --> 21:49.214
Look, I'm sure Michael would understand.

21:51.343 --> 21:52.802
You know what? I'm...

21:52.886 --> 21:55.680
I'm not taking relationship
advice from you.

21:55.764 --> 21:57.641
I mean, come on.

21:58.807 --> 22:01.893
I just don't want you to turn
around and have nothing left.

22:51.945 --> 22:53.738
I'm still waiting
on the employee interviews.

22:53.822 --> 22:56.116
I called again.
They should send a dropbox soon.

22:56.199 --> 22:59.786
Well, I just need them by Monday, okay?

22:59.869 --> 23:01.371
- Got it.
- Thanks.

23:01.453 --> 23:03.955
Oh, and a Katherine Wallace called.

23:04.039 --> 23:06.269
She didn't say what it was about,
but she sounded like...

23:06.293 --> 23:09.713
Okay, um, did she leave a number?

23:09.796 --> 23:11.548
Uh, yeah, I put it on your post sheet.

23:12.507 --> 23:15.093
Okay, thanks. Have a good weekend.

23:15.176 --> 23:16.678
Enjoy the party.

23:16.761 --> 23:18.430
Let me know if
there's anything you need.

23:18.512 --> 23:19.638
Okay, thanks, Alexis.

23:23.518 --> 23:24.936
Hi, Barry.

23:25.936 --> 23:27.312
I'm here to see Rebecca.

23:27.897 --> 23:31.609
She's not expecting me,
but I thought I'd drop these by for her.

23:34.528 --> 23:36.405
Rebecca moved out six weeks ago.

23:37.572 --> 23:38.907
Didn't she tell you?

23:38.990 --> 23:41.660
She hasn't mentioned anything.

23:43.580 --> 23:45.790
Where did she move to?
Did she leave an address?

23:45.874 --> 23:47.250
I don't know.

23:47.334 --> 23:49.544
A few things have still come
for her in the mail.

23:51.379 --> 23:52.380
Okay.

23:53.173 --> 23:55.550
No, no, no, it's all right.

23:55.634 --> 23:57.886
Thank you, Barry, thank you.

23:57.969 --> 24:01.014
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, too.

27:15.834 --> 27:17.419
It's gorgeous.

27:20.171 --> 27:26.344
I was going to tell her
after her party, but, well...

27:38.396 --> 27:41.316
People think being alone
is the scariest thing in the world.

27:42.902 --> 27:44.154
They're wrong.

27:44.988 --> 27:47.949
Lying to yourself is far worse.

27:53.872 --> 27:56.333
Happy birthday, Jeanie.

28:39.501 --> 28:41.503
When was the last time you saw her?

28:42.212 --> 28:43.380
Two months ago?

28:44.005 --> 28:45.382
It was around my birthday.

28:45.465 --> 28:48.760
She stopped by to drop off a present,
and we spoke for, like, a minute.

28:49.594 --> 28:52.681
And why are you so afraid
to talk to her, Allison?

28:53.556 --> 28:54.891
Do you know that look?

28:55.433 --> 28:59.813
The one where the person you love most
is completely disappointed in you?

29:00.313 --> 29:04.317
Or they no longer see you as their kid,
but as an individual,

29:04.776 --> 29:06.486
and they don't like what they see?

29:08.029 --> 29:11.366
Did you ever think it
was your mom who disappointed you?

29:44.856 --> 29:46.232
Avengers assemble!

29:46.318 --> 29:48.862
- Assemble, Avengers!
- Avengers assemble!

29:48.945 --> 29:50.989
Assemble!

29:52.324 --> 29:54.618
Well, hello there, Captain America.

29:54.699 --> 29:57.827
Ah! Now Loki's here.
Don't let him get ya!

29:57.911 --> 29:59.287
I'm not the bad guy.

30:01.458 --> 30:02.959
Mommy's the Hulk.

30:03.043 --> 30:05.337
Where've you been this morning, Hulk?

30:05.420 --> 30:08.214
Oh, just out doing errands.
Picked up the cake.

30:08.923 --> 30:11.301
And I got money to pay the magician.

30:11.382 --> 30:13.176
- Right.
- You look great.

30:14.054 --> 30:17.182
And I got some extra candy
for the piñata and the goodies.

30:17.265 --> 30:19.100
My God, you are on it. That's so hot.

30:19.934 --> 30:20.935
You like that, huh?

30:21.017 --> 30:23.228
You know how I feel
about that soccer mom stuff.

30:24.814 --> 30:26.775
- You're not even kidding.
- Unh-unh.

30:27.692 --> 30:29.486
- So it looks good, right?
- Mm-hmm.

30:29.567 --> 30:32.153
And I thought
I'd set up the caterers outside.

30:32.989 --> 30:36.493
And what about this?
Should I put this...

30:37.117 --> 30:40.662
- Can you think of anything else?
- Mnh-mnh.

30:42.122 --> 30:43.122
Okay.

31:07.065 --> 31:09.693
- What's all the commotion?
- Just through here.

31:10.694 --> 31:13.363
I didn't know we were getting a tent.

31:13.446 --> 31:15.615
Yeah, where's Harold?
Did you put him away?

31:15.699 --> 31:18.576
Hey, it's just a party, okay?
Relax a little.

31:28.376 --> 31:29.376
Oh, my God.

31:30.213 --> 31:31.715
I wanted a haircut.

31:31.798 --> 31:33.842
But we talked about it, right?

31:33.923 --> 31:37.385
Why would you disregard that
and go do it yourself?

31:37.679 --> 31:39.764
I wanted to look like me.

31:41.391 --> 31:43.643
I don't know what I'm doing here, honey.

31:44.017 --> 31:47.145
I'm not trained in this.
Turn around, please.

31:47.395 --> 31:51.274
Hey, it's Grandma.
She wants to wish you a happy birthday.

31:51.860 --> 31:53.903
Always has the best timing.

31:54.738 --> 31:55.780
Hi, Grandma, hi.

31:55.864 --> 31:58.908
How's the birthday girl?
Are you excited for your party?

31:58.992 --> 32:00.869
Mm. I cut my hair.

32:01.369 --> 32:02.871
Mommy's trying to fix it.

32:02.954 --> 32:05.582
Oh, I'm sure she is.

32:44.621 --> 32:45.789
Oh, hey!

32:45.872 --> 32:47.958
I'm so glad you guys made it.

32:48.039 --> 32:52.752
The house looks fantastic, Jean.
And, oh, you look stunning.

32:52.837 --> 32:54.547
Come on outside, everything's set up.

32:54.631 --> 32:57.717
- Did you do all of this yourself?
- Yeah, basically.

32:57.801 --> 32:58.969
That is very impressive.

32:59.052 --> 33:00.595
Hey, wait up!

33:04.140 --> 33:06.935
There's a very special
birthday girl who's going to assist me.

33:07.018 --> 33:07.852
Is there a Dolly?

33:07.934 --> 33:10.895
So glad you used Milana.
It's pretty affordable, too, right?

33:10.979 --> 33:13.481
Welcome, Dolly.
Could you tell me when to stop?

33:14.482 --> 33:17.568
What... yeah, yeah, she's great.
Thanks for the rec.

33:18.113 --> 33:18.947
Can you put...

33:19.028 --> 33:21.739
I love the way Dolly dresses.
It's so original.

33:22.367 --> 33:25.412
Yeah, we think it's important
that she expresses herself.

33:25.493 --> 33:27.870
That's the psychologist talking again,
isn't it?

33:28.832 --> 33:30.875
- Is this vintage?
- What?

33:30.959 --> 33:33.420
Oh, this, uh, it's
from a different life.

33:33.503 --> 33:35.255
Dolly, will you inspect the deck?

33:39.674 --> 33:40.842
Are you getting it, hon?

33:40.925 --> 33:42.802
Dolly, hit the deck of cards.

33:42.887 --> 33:43.972
Is this your card?

33:44.554 --> 33:46.472
- No.
- Yes, it is. No?

33:48.935 --> 33:52.314
Honey, what's going on?
What's going on?

33:52.397 --> 33:53.606
He's lying to us.

33:53.690 --> 33:56.568
No, he's not lying, honey.
He's a magician. That's what they do.

33:56.651 --> 33:58.987
- It's just a trick.
- I don't want to be tricked.

33:59.070 --> 34:00.989
He should be honest.
That's what you tell me.

34:01.072 --> 34:03.199
Well, yeah, of course,
it's always good to be honest,

34:03.283 --> 34:06.036
but, honey, this is just a game, okay?

34:06.119 --> 34:08.955
It's not real.
Now just go be with your friends.

34:09.039 --> 34:10.706
Go on, enjoy the party.

34:10.788 --> 34:12.415
You're not mad at me anymore?

34:14.460 --> 34:17.922
Oh, honey, no, I'm not mad at you,

34:18.590 --> 34:20.717
'cause you're my girl, right?

34:20.800 --> 34:22.552
And I'd do anything for you.

34:23.136 --> 34:25.804
Give up everything
just to make you happy.

34:26.804 --> 34:28.639
Fine, but I wanna do the next trick.

34:29.223 --> 34:30.266
Go on, then.

34:51.998 --> 34:53.458
- Hey.
- Hey!

34:53.541 --> 34:55.668
I can't believe
you came all the way out here.

34:55.752 --> 34:59.547
Well, you said it was important,
and I couldn't seem to send it all.

34:59.631 --> 35:00.632
That's great.

35:02.550 --> 35:03.385
Hey!

35:03.466 --> 35:06.177
- Hey, Jean!
- You must be the famous Alexis.

35:06.260 --> 35:08.096
- So nice to finally meet you.
- You, too.

35:09.182 --> 35:12.310
I'm sorry to interrupt.
You must be completely overwhelmed.

35:12.392 --> 35:15.103
No, not at all.
Can I get you something?

35:15.686 --> 35:17.814
No, no, I just came to drop this off.

35:17.899 --> 35:20.694
But, um, it's a lovely party.

35:20.777 --> 35:22.487
Ah, yeah, all Jean.

35:23.611 --> 35:25.780
Oh, I didn't want to come empty-handed.

35:25.865 --> 35:28.493
- It's just a book.
- That's really thoughtful, Alexis.

35:28.576 --> 35:30.620
Thank you, we don't buy her
enough books anymore.

35:30.704 --> 35:32.914
Hey, stay for one drink, okay?
It's a long trip back.

35:32.998 --> 35:34.249
The bar's right out front.

35:34.332 --> 35:36.334
- Okay, yes.
- All right.

35:38.753 --> 35:39.754
Huh?

35:42.340 --> 35:43.633
She's not your type?

35:44.676 --> 35:46.845
You're a fucking liar.
She's everyone's type.

35:46.928 --> 35:49.431
- I even might consider it.
- Oh, what? She's not.

35:49.514 --> 35:51.099
Okay, listen, she's attractive, fine.

35:51.182 --> 35:56.271
But even if I was on the hunt,
she's young, and she feels young, okay?

35:56.771 --> 36:00.233
Good, 'cause if I lose you
to your assistant,

36:00.317 --> 36:03.445
I'd be mad at you for making
me part of the cliché.

36:21.463 --> 36:23.548
- We were just...
- No, it's fine.

36:23.632 --> 36:25.383
Can I bum one, please?

36:27.093 --> 36:28.136
Thanks.

36:35.435 --> 36:36.435
Thanks.

36:56.412 --> 36:59.373
- I need to know if I can return it.
- We're not gonna open it.

37:01.459 --> 37:03.002
What are you doing here, Mom?

37:03.085 --> 37:04.712
Dolly invited me.

37:05.215 --> 37:08.176
I mean, it's her birthday,
so I thought I'd honor her wish.

37:08.758 --> 37:10.092
Never disappoint.

37:12.097 --> 37:13.139
Oh, Michael.

37:13.223 --> 37:15.350
Oh, God, you're so attractive.

37:15.433 --> 37:17.143
Aw, it's nice to see you, Nancy.

37:17.852 --> 37:19.312
Everything looks lovely.

37:21.646 --> 37:23.689
Well, I think I'll get the cake.

37:23.773 --> 37:27.151
- Right now?
- Mm-hmm, seems like the right time.

37:27.235 --> 37:29.779
- Yes!
- Oh, really?

37:44.004 --> 37:45.764
- We're ready for the cake.
- Mm-hmm.

37:49.384 --> 37:51.344
That is the famous Alexis.

37:51.425 --> 37:53.425
- Nice to meet you.
- Say hello.

37:57.640 --> 37:59.123
I'll make you take a good one.

37:59.148 --> 37:59.954
No, Daddy.

37:59.978 --> 38:02.188
- Thank you.
- Nice to meet you, Dolly.

38:03.440 --> 38:04.899
Yes, yes, go, go.

38:08.695 --> 38:10.822
- She's so sweet.
- A little shy.

38:15.908 --> 38:20.454
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

38:20.790 --> 38:26.004
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

38:26.087 --> 38:32.344
♪ Happy birthday, dear Dolly ♪

38:32.427 --> 38:37.557
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

38:38.558 --> 38:40.226
Go on, make a wish.

38:45.688 --> 38:48.774
Over here! Pass it to me.

38:51.821 --> 38:54.407
What will it be next,
her own bathroom at school?

38:54.491 --> 38:58.119
I'm sorry, we can be accommodating, but
I am tired of bending over backwards.

38:58.203 --> 39:00.080
We all have our own
things to worry about.

39:01.915 --> 39:03.959
I'm sorry, are you kidding me?

39:04.334 --> 39:08.421
Oh, Jean, no, I was just saying that...

39:08.505 --> 39:11.549
I've done nothing but try
to make a nice party for you guys

39:11.631 --> 39:13.924
so you can day drink
and bitch about your husbands.

39:14.008 --> 39:16.886
And what, you think you can
disrespect me and my daughter?

39:16.972 --> 39:17.598
Jean? Hey.

39:17.623 --> 39:19.498
No, I'm not gonna
play this game anymore,

39:19.557 --> 39:22.197
and I'm not gonna pretend that
this is acceptable, 'cause it's not.

39:22.268 --> 39:26.314
We're all just lying all the time
by pretending to be friends

39:26.395 --> 39:28.356
and not buying into the politics.

39:28.439 --> 39:31.859
And you, with your stash of pills,
and your obsession with appearances.

39:32.612 --> 39:35.373
You're the reason why my little girl has
to be scared of being judged.

39:35.407 --> 39:36.992
And today, on her birthday,

39:37.075 --> 39:39.286
when she's supposed to be joyful
and innocent,

39:39.369 --> 39:41.413
she has to answer to people like you?

39:41.496 --> 39:44.249
I'm sorry, I'm not gonna let you
take that away from her,

39:44.330 --> 39:45.956
'cause you're just not that powerful.

39:51.715 --> 39:53.633
And you know what the ironic thing is?

39:53.717 --> 39:58.763
I wanted today to be perfect
because I actually cared what you think.

39:59.345 --> 40:04.475
But now I realize I'm better off,
because I'm nothing like you.

40:50.607 --> 40:52.525
This is for babies.

40:52.609 --> 40:53.777
Oh.

40:54.817 --> 40:57.194
Yeah, someone doesn't know kids.

40:57.906 --> 41:02.160
- I'm not three to five. I'm nine.
- Of course you are, cookie.

41:02.661 --> 41:04.829
You're becoming such a big girl.

41:07.332 --> 41:08.500
- Mommy?
- Hmm?

41:08.583 --> 41:10.251
Did you not like my party?

41:10.794 --> 41:12.837
Yeah, I loved your party.

41:13.672 --> 41:17.550
Oh, honey, I'm sorry if I
was upset for a moment.

41:18.134 --> 41:21.179
Sometimes it happens, even with mommies.

41:22.136 --> 41:23.846
Do you want to know what I wished for?

41:23.929 --> 41:26.599
- A hoverboard.
- No.

41:29.020 --> 41:33.108
Okay, good, um, a trampoline?

41:33.191 --> 41:36.653
- Nope.
- Okay, I give up.

41:37.320 --> 41:39.781
I wished for the magician
to make you happy.

41:43.201 --> 41:45.912
Oh, honey, listen to me.

41:46.579 --> 41:48.290
I am happy,

41:48.999 --> 41:51.001
and I don't need a magician for that.

41:51.081 --> 41:53.793
I have you and Daddy.

41:54.546 --> 41:56.798
And that's more than enough.

41:59.551 --> 42:01.344
Now let's go to sleep.

42:19.571 --> 42:22.365
- I love you.
- I love you, too, Mommy.

42:38.089 --> 42:39.591
You know, you didn't have to do that.

42:40.759 --> 42:43.720
- Did you even hear what they said?
- It doesn't matter.

42:43.803 --> 42:46.139
Dolly didn't hear it,
and it's her party today.

42:46.222 --> 42:49.100
Right, but she's fine.
She doesn't know what happened.

42:49.184 --> 42:51.064
I'm not gonna let them
talk like that about her.

42:51.102 --> 42:53.196
I'm obviously gonna
want to protect her.

42:53.221 --> 42:54.221
And I don't?

42:54.689 --> 42:57.067
Well, no. You don't know what it's like.

42:57.150 --> 42:58.151
You're always working.

42:58.232 --> 43:01.026
You don't do the pick-ups.
You don't do the drop-offs.

43:01.112 --> 43:03.615
You don't deal with those monsters.

43:03.696 --> 43:05.197
So you can't presume to know.

43:05.281 --> 43:07.575
Just like I don't know
what you deal with at work.

43:07.661 --> 43:09.037
Well, that's right, you don't.

43:09.746 --> 43:13.333
But it's interesting
that little miss Alexis shows up today.

43:14.331 --> 43:16.041
She was just doing her job.

43:16.127 --> 43:19.005
But yeah, go ahead, make that about you.

43:19.086 --> 43:22.131
I guess it's not enough that you
hijacked Dolly's party already today.

43:22.214 --> 43:24.341
Really? What should I
have done, Michael, huh?

43:24.636 --> 43:26.846
Just, just pretend
like nothing happened?

43:26.930 --> 43:28.807
- Pretend Michelle said nothing?
- Yep.

43:28.890 --> 43:31.935
Well, I don't operate like you do.
We can't all just live in denial.

43:32.433 --> 43:35.102
No, but we do live in a society
with certain rules

43:35.188 --> 43:36.982
like control your fucking impulses.

43:37.065 --> 43:39.043
I know you think you can say
whatever you want all the time,

43:39.067 --> 43:40.443
but it doesn't work like that.

43:40.527 --> 43:42.112
Trust me, I don't.

43:42.529 --> 43:45.532
But what I really don't understand is,
why do you even give a shit?

43:45.991 --> 43:48.285
It's like you're a completely
different person lately.

43:48.866 --> 43:50.868
You seriously don't get it, do you?

43:50.951 --> 43:52.453
You just think I'm being frivolous.

43:53.037 --> 43:54.222
I don't think you're being frivolous.

43:54.246 --> 43:57.166
- I think you're being selfish.
- I want her to feel special today

43:57.252 --> 44:01.131
because I know what it feels like
to be so fucking invisible all the time.

44:01.211 --> 44:04.632
But you are so far up your own ass
that you can't even see it.

44:04.715 --> 44:05.799
That's really mature.

44:05.885 --> 44:07.887
Why don't you just own up
and take responsibility?

44:07.968 --> 44:09.553
Isn't that what you tell your patients?

44:09.637 --> 44:13.307
Oh, fuck off, you don't know
the first thing about therapy.

44:16.185 --> 44:17.519
I'm gonna go to sleep.
