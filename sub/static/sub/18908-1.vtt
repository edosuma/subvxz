WEBVTT

00:07.375 --> 00:08.342
- Previously on "Colony"...
- Charlie's okay.

00:10.411 --> 00:12.146
The government found him
in Santa Monica Bloc.

00:12.180 --> 00:14.848
- Every person in the colony was
filtered through this algorithm.

00:14.882 --> 00:16.550
It's how they knew
who to select

00:16.584 --> 00:18.018
and what to do with them.

00:18.052 --> 00:19.620
- I was at work when they came.

00:19.653 --> 00:22.356
Guys in the Bureau
being taken out, disappearing.

00:22.390 --> 00:24.892
Fought my way across town,
but it took me hours.

00:24.925 --> 00:26.727
- I was the provost at Stanford.

00:26.760 --> 00:30.364
They needed someone that could
bring about order and control

00:30.398 --> 00:31.699
quickly, peacefully.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.634
- My mother died
the night of the Arrival.

00:33.667 --> 00:34.868
Shock did her in.

00:34.902 --> 00:36.404
- How long you been
spying on me?

00:36.437 --> 00:37.638
Selling me out

00:37.671 --> 00:39.473
to those killers you work for?

00:39.507 --> 00:40.708
- I did it to protect you.

00:40.741 --> 00:42.210
- Bullshit!
You did it for you.

00:42.243 --> 00:44.044
- Someone has to say "enough"!

00:44.078 --> 00:45.679
- Homeland's Engineer Corps
found a tunnel

00:45.713 --> 00:47.348
under an old DWP substation

00:47.381 --> 00:49.683
that leads right into downtown.
- Oh, my God,

00:49.717 --> 00:51.385
we're outside the Colony.
aren't we?

00:51.419 --> 00:53.487
- We're gonna shut it down.
- We can exploit this.

00:53.521 --> 00:55.323
Set a trap for whoever's
using the tunnel.

00:55.356 --> 00:56.924
- Hands up!
On your knees!

00:56.957 --> 00:58.726
Get down!
- Here.

00:58.759 --> 01:01.295
This will get you through
the Santa Monica Gateway.

01:01.329 --> 01:02.630
Go find your son.

01:02.663 --> 01:05.633
[dramatic music]

01:05.666 --> 01:09.170

01:09.203 --> 01:12.173
[bluesy music]

01:12.206 --> 01:18.479
*

01:20.281 --> 01:23.016
- All right, Bram, order's up.
Kitchen's closing.

01:23.050 --> 01:25.186
No iPad at the table, please,
Charlie sir.

01:25.219 --> 01:28.088
- [grumbles]
- Thank you.

01:28.122 --> 01:30.191
- Good morning.
- Breakfast?

01:30.224 --> 01:32.360
- I'll get something there.

01:32.393 --> 01:35.095
- Daddy, look.

01:35.129 --> 01:37.265
- Pretty.
Old one or new one?

01:37.298 --> 01:38.999
- New one.

01:39.032 --> 01:40.268
- Dodgers signed new pitcher.

01:40.301 --> 01:41.702
Guy from Villanova.

01:41.735 --> 01:44.338
Hernando says his slider
has starter potential.

01:44.372 --> 01:47.175
- Excellent, excellent.

01:47.208 --> 01:49.677
- Hey, Dad.
- Morning.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.712
*

01:51.745 --> 01:54.515
- What do you think about me
coloring this gray?

01:54.548 --> 01:58.452
- Um...
[indistinct chatter]

01:58.486 --> 01:59.887
- Hey.

01:59.920 --> 02:03.023
How you doing?

02:03.056 --> 02:06.227
You've been on another planet
for days now.

02:06.260 --> 02:10.564
*

02:10.598 --> 02:13.701
- It's Devon.

02:13.734 --> 02:15.536
*

02:15.569 --> 02:18.372
- What'd she do?

02:18.406 --> 02:20.274
- I'm not sure even I want
to know all the details,

02:20.308 --> 02:22.243
but it's not good.

02:22.276 --> 02:26.079
- Could it blow back on you?

02:26.113 --> 02:28.782
Okay, for real.
What did she do?

02:28.816 --> 02:31.319
- Think she got
her hands dirty.

02:31.352 --> 02:34.121
- [inhales deeply]
What are your options?

02:34.154 --> 02:37.591
- Tell the Bureau what I know
or ask out.

02:37.625 --> 02:40.228
- Seems easy enough.

02:40.261 --> 02:41.962
I mean, you don't have
to make it about her, right?

02:41.995 --> 02:45.233
It's been a few years.
You want a change.

02:45.266 --> 02:47.167
[door bell rings,
dog barking]

02:47.201 --> 02:49.570
Could be the high road
for both of you.

02:49.603 --> 02:51.138
Maybe.
- Yeah.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.273
- Hey.

02:52.306 --> 02:53.574
We'll figure it out.

02:53.607 --> 02:54.775
Either way.

02:54.808 --> 02:56.244
- I know.

02:56.277 --> 02:57.611
I love you.

02:57.645 --> 02:59.747
- Love you.

02:59.780 --> 03:03.016
Break a leg.
- Hope it doesn't come to that.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.254
- Morning.
- Morning.

03:06.287 --> 03:08.389
- Hey.

03:08.422 --> 03:10.824
Oh.
[laughs]

03:10.858 --> 03:13.727
Minnie, I love you too,
sweetheart.

03:13.761 --> 03:17.164
[laughs]

03:17.197 --> 03:20.601
[sighs]
Ah, good morning, Katie.

03:20.634 --> 03:23.003
- Hey, girl.
- Morning, smaller Bowmans.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.606
- Hey, Devon, you gonna
go catch some bad guys today?

03:25.639 --> 03:28.709
- Only if your dad doesn't
slow me down.

03:28.742 --> 03:31.111
- Nice.
Are you ready to go?

03:31.144 --> 03:33.581
- Hey, don't forget to,
uh, pick up Charlie today, huh?

03:33.614 --> 03:35.849
- Copy that.
See you tonight.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.951
- Copy that.

03:39.720 --> 03:40.721
[door closes]

03:48.629 --> 03:51.599

[engine turns over]

04:00.374 --> 04:07.381
*

04:42.182 --> 04:42.450
.

04:42.483 --> 04:43.216
- There's construction
on Olympic.

04:45.085 --> 04:47.921
We should cut over to Colorado.
- All right.

04:50.358 --> 04:51.825
Thank you, Hal.

04:51.859 --> 04:54.595
- It's maps, Mom.
Who's Hal?

04:54.628 --> 04:56.930
- Hal retired.
What's next?

04:56.964 --> 05:00.100
[dramatic music]

05:00.133 --> 05:01.869
- Now we're in the ocean.

05:01.902 --> 05:04.505
- Super weird.
I feel dry.

05:04.538 --> 05:05.873
- Look.

05:05.906 --> 05:08.342
- Oh, my God.
You're gonna get us killed.

05:08.376 --> 05:12.145
*

05:12.179 --> 05:14.348
- Wh--Mom, traffic.

05:14.382 --> 05:16.984
- I know.

05:17.017 --> 05:19.186
*

05:19.219 --> 05:22.255
- Come on, maps.

05:22.289 --> 05:25.759
But--now we're in San Pedro.
- That's all right.

05:25.793 --> 05:27.928
I know how to get there
the old-fashioned way.

05:27.961 --> 05:30.398
Watch this.
I'm amazing.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.768
- I've had three brokers tell me

05:34.802 --> 05:37.170
that was the best price
they could get.

05:37.204 --> 05:39.006
Well, if you're gonna
keep the house,

05:39.039 --> 05:41.542
then you're gonna be
responsible for the payments.

05:41.575 --> 05:42.843
Don't get mad at me.

05:42.876 --> 05:44.244
This is what
your lawyer mandated.

05:44.277 --> 05:46.914
I can't do this now.
I'm at work.

05:48.782 --> 05:51.852
[indistinct chatter
and phone ringing]

05:51.885 --> 05:53.186
- Morning, Alan.

05:53.220 --> 05:55.222
Representatives
from the textbook publishers

05:55.255 --> 05:56.690
are in your office.

05:56.724 --> 05:58.325
- Who?

06:04.064 --> 06:06.099
- Good morning, Alan.
- Good morning.

06:06.133 --> 06:09.937
- We are very excited
to talk to you.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.772
- Who isn't excited
about textbooks?

06:11.805 --> 06:12.940
- [chuckles]

06:12.973 --> 06:14.475
- We aren't here
about textbooks.

06:14.508 --> 06:15.609
We're recruiting officers.

06:15.643 --> 06:16.977
- We're with an agency called

06:17.010 --> 06:19.146
the Institute
for Global Advancement.

06:19.179 --> 06:21.882
- You're a man of vastly
untapped potential, Alan.

06:21.915 --> 06:24.284
Your current employment
in no way suits your talents.

06:24.317 --> 06:26.687
- You were selected from a pool
of tens of thousands of people.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.489
- I don't recall applying
for anything.

06:28.522 --> 06:29.957
- You didn't.

06:29.990 --> 06:31.324
Our clients have an algorithm

06:31.358 --> 06:32.993
that pre-selects their clientele
for them.

06:33.026 --> 06:35.863
- And you happen to be
the perfect man for the job.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.165
- All right.
- You own two properties.

06:38.198 --> 06:40.167
A one-bedroom condominium
and a home

06:40.200 --> 06:42.503
where you used to live with
your wife and your daughter.

06:42.536 --> 06:44.505
You make your alimony payments
on time,

06:44.538 --> 06:46.039
you help in paying
for your daughter's

06:46.073 --> 06:47.641
private high school education,

06:47.675 --> 06:49.577
and you carry no unsecured debt.

06:49.610 --> 06:50.911
- How do you--
- You manage all this

06:50.944 --> 06:53.380
by making $72,800 a year

06:53.413 --> 06:54.982
as a purchasing manager

06:55.015 --> 06:58.418
for an unranked
secondary education institution.

06:58.452 --> 07:00.187
- How do you know all this?
Who the hell are you?

07:00.220 --> 07:02.790
- You've also managed,
over a period of nine years,

07:02.823 --> 07:05.593
to divert a large amount of cash
from this institution

07:05.626 --> 07:07.260
into an account held in the name

07:07.294 --> 07:09.096
of your long-deceased
paternal uncle,

07:09.129 --> 07:11.999
also named Alan Snyder.

07:12.032 --> 07:14.468
*

07:14.502 --> 07:16.804
You're a fascinating man, Alan.

07:16.837 --> 07:23.844
*

07:29.382 --> 07:31.952
Alan, even great men

07:31.985 --> 07:34.988
make two or three critical
mistakes in their lives.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.291
- You don't get
where I'm sitting

07:38.325 --> 07:39.960
by only making
two or three mistakes.

07:39.993 --> 07:41.995
- It's the choices
you make today

07:42.029 --> 07:44.532
that will determine your future.

07:44.565 --> 07:46.967
- All you have to do
is say "yes."

07:48.902 --> 07:51.471
- "Yes" to what, exactly?

07:53.641 --> 07:56.844
- To meeting our client.

07:58.712 --> 08:00.113
- [chuckles]

08:00.147 --> 08:01.682
You been in your house, what,

08:01.715 --> 08:03.617
like three years now?
- Four.

08:03.651 --> 08:05.352
Since before Gracie
went to school.

08:05.385 --> 08:07.855
- Oh, shit, that's right.

08:07.888 --> 08:09.422
Man, time is flying.

08:09.456 --> 08:11.391
- Yeah, it is.
- [laughs]

08:11.424 --> 08:14.427
You remember your home
inspection being so scary?

08:14.461 --> 08:16.129
- I don't.
- [exhales]

08:16.163 --> 08:18.398
Everything on that report
makes it sound like

08:18.431 --> 08:20.467
my bungalow's gonna
burst into flames

08:20.500 --> 08:22.402
as soon as I close escrow.

08:22.435 --> 08:24.738
[laughs]

08:24.772 --> 08:26.974
[sighs]

08:30.944 --> 08:34.414
"So great you're gonna be
a homeowner, Devon.

08:34.447 --> 08:38.385
I'm really happy for you,
Devon."

08:38.418 --> 08:39.920
- I am happy for you.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.321
- What's with you?
You've been an asshole

08:41.354 --> 08:45.225
ever since I told you
I was gonna buy my place.

08:45.258 --> 08:47.728
- How'd you find the money
to buy a place in Santa Monica?

08:47.761 --> 08:49.329
- What do you mean?
[laughs]

08:49.362 --> 08:50.631
- I know what I make.

08:50.664 --> 08:52.566
Pretty sure I know
what you make.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.936
- [chuckles]
I've got an uncle who likes me.

08:55.969 --> 08:59.239
Gave me the down payment.
Okay?

08:59.272 --> 09:02.175
- Okay.

09:02.209 --> 09:05.913
- What?
You jealous?

09:05.946 --> 09:07.948
[laughs]

09:10.117 --> 09:14.054
- I'm requesting a transfer.

09:14.087 --> 09:16.056
- You're leaving Los Angeles?

09:16.089 --> 09:17.490
- I'm staying in LA.

09:17.524 --> 09:20.360
I'm just gonna ask
off the taskforce.

09:23.130 --> 09:26.066
- Why?

09:26.099 --> 09:28.435
- Because your relationship
with the Armenians

09:28.468 --> 09:32.405
makes me uncomfortable.

09:32.439 --> 09:34.842
- [exhales sharply]

09:34.875 --> 09:38.345
Is there something
you want to ask me?

09:38.378 --> 09:40.013
We have relationships
with criminals

09:40.047 --> 09:41.682
so that we can catch criminals.

09:41.715 --> 09:43.684
- I don't wanna know any more
than I already do.

09:43.717 --> 09:45.018
- What, so you're gonna
accuse me of being dirty,

09:45.052 --> 09:47.354
but I-I can't defend myself?

09:47.387 --> 09:48.956
- I'm not asking you
to defend yourself.

09:48.989 --> 09:50.557
I'm just asking for a transfer.

09:50.590 --> 09:53.260
- Will, you're--
you're questioning my integrity.

09:53.293 --> 09:56.063
I wanna talk about it.
- I don't.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.631
- [scoffs]

09:57.665 --> 09:58.732
You're unbelievable.

09:58.766 --> 10:00.600
[cell phone ringing]

10:00.634 --> 10:02.870
Five years
we've been working together.

10:02.903 --> 10:04.604
[second cell phone ringing]
- [sighs]

10:04.638 --> 10:06.306
That's why I'm having
this conversation with you

10:06.339 --> 10:11.278
and not the AD.

10:11.311 --> 10:13.213
- Bowman.
- Yeah.

10:13.246 --> 10:14.648
[indistinct chatter]

10:14.682 --> 10:16.283
- All right, listen up.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.919
*

10:18.952 --> 10:24.124
Overnight, seven VIPs
went missing in the LA area.

10:24.157 --> 10:26.159
The Deputy Director
of Central Intelligence,

10:26.193 --> 10:28.628
chief engineers at
Lockheed and Boeing,

10:28.662 --> 10:30.463
an official with
the Defense Nuclear Agency,

10:30.497 --> 10:34.234
and three
senior military officers.

10:34.267 --> 10:36.103
Now, it appears that
at least three of them

10:36.136 --> 10:38.271
were extracted
by a militarized entity

10:38.305 --> 10:40.607
whose origin,
at the present, is unclear.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.409
The others...

10:42.442 --> 10:44.444
well, the others
are unaccounted for.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.780
Your department heads have
your individual assignments.

10:46.814 --> 10:49.950
The goal is to bring these
people back home safe.

10:49.983 --> 10:53.453
- Can you share any theories
as to what this is about, sir?

10:53.486 --> 10:56.589
- Unfortunately, we don't
know much of anything right now.

10:56.623 --> 10:59.326
We're trying to keep this
operation as small as possible

10:59.359 --> 11:01.328
until we know more.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.396
We don't want to embarrass
the Bureau

11:03.430 --> 11:05.699
or create a panic.

11:05.733 --> 11:07.234
Thank you.

11:07.267 --> 11:08.668

11:08.702 --> 11:10.337
- Still want to put in
for that transfer,

11:10.370 --> 11:13.741
or you think you can suffer
through another day with me?

Oh, my God.
Eric!

11:58.752 --> 12:01.588
You scared the life out of me.

Sorry about that.

I didn't know
you were coming home.

Oh, my goodness.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.867
- Unplanned trip.

12:25.478 --> 12:32.485

12:39.159 --> 12:41.161
- She sleeps a lot.

12:45.032 --> 12:48.001
I take her to dialysis Sundays,
Tuesdays, and Fridays.

12:48.035 --> 12:49.736
In between, we do small errands.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.172
Grocery store, nail salon,
those kinds of things.

12:52.205 --> 12:54.641
- Thanks for this.

12:54.674 --> 12:57.177

you pay me the big bucks.

[both chuckle]

13:04.351 --> 13:06.553

I'm home.

- [laughs softly]

mm.

13:15.362 --> 13:22.369

13:25.538 --> 13:27.941
- Go back to sleep.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.656
[sighs]

13:59.072 --> 14:01.041
- This is weird, right?
- Mm.

14:01.074 --> 14:02.709
- Bunch of
military intelligence guys

14:02.742 --> 14:05.478
and then engineers?

14:05.512 --> 14:07.915
- Who knows?

14:11.851 --> 14:15.255
- Some kind of coordinated
terrorist attack, maybe.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.191
- Turn here.

14:22.996 --> 14:25.999
- I'm doing you a favor,
you know.

14:26.033 --> 14:29.669
- I'm sure
I'll appreciate it someday.

Special Agent Howard.

FBI.

16:01.328 --> 16:03.263
- Whatever that camera sees,

16:03.296 --> 16:05.298
it's not telling you anything.

16:07.800 --> 16:11.271
- We're here to help you.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.806
- If you're FBI,
I want to see IDs.

16:13.840 --> 16:16.076
- [quietly]
Panic room.

16:18.345 --> 16:20.780
- What's going on?
Are you sure they left?

16:20.813 --> 16:22.282
I'm not coming out
until it's safe.

16:22.315 --> 16:24.084
- Try to stay calm, Mr. Lawes.

16:24.117 --> 16:26.086
The bad guys missed you.
We're here to help.

16:26.119 --> 16:27.654
Our bosses are very interested

16:27.687 --> 16:29.489
in a bunch of VIPs
that went missing last night.

16:29.522 --> 16:32.892
You were one of them.

16:32.925 --> 16:34.927
- If you don't want our help,
fine.

16:34.961 --> 16:36.729
Good luck to you.
Got plenty of other stuff

16:36.763 --> 16:38.665
that we can be doing.

Good morning.

I have 9:00 p.m.

- Are you jet-lagged?

17:11.131 --> 17:12.965
- Thirsty.

17:14.267 --> 17:16.269
- Welcome home.

Sorry, I was hoping
for some music.

17:30.150 --> 17:32.519
God, I haven't seen you
in an age.

17:32.552 --> 17:35.555
What brings you back
to the west?

17:42.762 --> 17:44.897
Better?

17:44.931 --> 17:47.767
- [chuckles]
Life changes.

17:47.800 --> 17:51.304
I plan to start
by wasting a lot more time here.

17:51.338 --> 17:54.073

We're happy to have you.

18:06.353 --> 18:09.021
- Can I ask you
a personal question?

18:09.055 --> 18:12.392
- Depends how personal.

18:12.425 --> 18:16.463
- You're a woman with
a husband, couple kids.

18:16.496 --> 18:18.665
Why the bar?

18:18.698 --> 18:22.302
- Um...

18:22.335 --> 18:24.837
purpose?

18:24.871 --> 18:27.374
I grew up watching my mom
dedicate her life

18:27.407 --> 18:31.144
to being a mother
and a wife to a naval officer,

18:31.178 --> 18:34.214
and I, uh--it was
important to me

18:34.247 --> 18:37.184
that my kids see me
as more than that.

18:37.217 --> 18:39.386
- Navy, huh?

18:39.419 --> 18:41.854
Didn't know that.

18:41.888 --> 18:44.724
- "Not self but country."

18:49.729 --> 18:53.099
This a career crisis
we're trying to drown here?

18:53.132 --> 18:57.437
*

18:57.470 --> 19:00.573
- I signed up when I was 19.

19:00.607 --> 19:03.476
Same as all the other hotheads.

19:03.510 --> 19:07.079
Thought I'd go whup ass,

19:07.113 --> 19:09.982
bring justice to a place
that needed it, you know?

19:10.016 --> 19:12.485
- I do.
I married one of those hotheads.

19:14.120 --> 19:17.089
How was it for you?

19:17.123 --> 19:19.492
- Did my tours,

19:19.526 --> 19:20.960
earned my experience.

19:20.993 --> 19:23.630
Then the private sector
came calling.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.164
*

19:25.198 --> 19:28.201
But there weren't any answers
there either.

19:34.040 --> 19:36.543
- They found Maria,

19:36.576 --> 19:40.146
my housekeeper, first.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.681
I snuck into my panic room

19:41.714 --> 19:43.316
and watched them
search the house for 20 minutes,

19:43.350 --> 19:45.818
and then they left.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.654
They must have jammed
my 3G radio.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.789
I couldn't get a call out.

19:49.822 --> 19:52.158

a panic room?

19:52.191 --> 19:54.193
- Good question.

19:59.566 --> 20:06.539
- [sighs]

20:06.573 --> 20:09.576
I'm not supposed
to talk about this...

20:12.011 --> 20:13.680
But I'm on a list.

20:13.713 --> 20:16.316
- What kind of list?

20:16.349 --> 20:20.186
- There are about 1,200 people
here in the U.S.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.389
In the event
of a major catastrophe,

20:22.422 --> 20:24.424
a nuclear war, terrorism,

20:24.457 --> 20:28.027
natural disaster, those things,

20:28.060 --> 20:30.363
we all get sequestered.

20:32.532 --> 20:34.100
If society ends,

responsible for rebooting it.

You know what?

23:32.211 --> 23:34.080
The house is mine now, Alan.

23:34.113 --> 23:36.816
- I--that's not what I mean.
I mean, you have to

23:36.849 --> 23:39.318
get out of Los Angeles
and you have to go now.

- No, no, no,

23:47.694 --> 23:49.662
she is not
going anywhere either.

Okay, sweetheart?

Rob and Hudson and come meet us?

you're gonna stay calm,
you're gonna grab Hudson,

26:52.845 --> 26:54.847

at the Yonk, okay?

26:54.881 --> 26:56.348
- Oh, my God.

26:56.382 --> 26:58.017
Is this, like, September 11th
or something?

26:58.050 --> 26:59.986
I mean, Rob's in the air.

27:00.019 --> 27:01.487
- Okay, don't panic.

Let's just be on the safe side.

Hang tight.

27:33.019 --> 27:35.321
- Now?

- Tell me your survival instinct
isn't screaming right now.

- They need us.
- Whatever's going on out there,

27:40.292 --> 27:44.196
a couple of feds aren't going
to make a difference.

27:44.230 --> 27:47.099

The Lockheed engineer.

It's just a power outage.

was dead and we--

32:14.133 --> 32:15.601

32:36.722 --> 32:38.424

32:38.457 --> 32:40.759
Anything with a circuit
got shut down.

I know that this is
a lot to process,

33:22.334 --> 33:23.702
but you just have
to tell yourself that

33:23.735 --> 33:26.672
what's happening was inevitable.

It's our job now to ensure that

the transition goes
as smoothly as possible.

Hey, brother.

making a move.

They detonated an EMP
in the upper atmosphere

34:35.174 --> 34:36.508

Contact from SOCOM told us
to bunker down here.

34:58.764 --> 35:00.432
knows exactly
what they're doing,

35:00.466 --> 35:03.001

real operator in the city

35:03.034 --> 35:04.836
under one roof.

here looking to start some shit,

35:08.174 --> 35:10.609
they got a world of pain
waiting for 'em.
