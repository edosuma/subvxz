00:33.283 --> 00:36.118
Good morning,
my little chicks and cocks.

00:36.244 --> 00:38.162
Malcolm, monitoring... All the usual.

00:38.288 --> 00:40.664
How did your team do at the weekend?

00:40.790 --> 00:43.500
- All right, yeah, we won.
- Wanker.

00:43.626 --> 00:46.628
Sam, morning. How are you?

00:46.755 --> 00:49.965
Well, pop-pickers,
what disc shall we start with today?

00:51.051 --> 00:53.552
Wonky Ron
or how about Simon Foster?

00:53.678 --> 00:56.722
On the Eddie Mair
PM programme on the BBC.

00:56.848 --> 00:59.516
MAIR:
Well, I'm joined by Simon Foster,

00:59.642 --> 01:01.935
the Minister
for International Development.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.021
You've been in the job for 18 months.

01:04.147 --> 01:06.065
Do you think you're making headway?

01:06.191 --> 01:08.067
Yes, I do.

01:08.193 --> 01:10.903
You'd expect me to say that, I suppose.

01:11.780 --> 01:13.572
Mark.

01:13.698 --> 01:16.366
You're co-ordinating
the Millennium Goals press release?

01:16.493 --> 01:18.285
Co-ordinate it better, please.

01:18.411 --> 01:20.329
Is that the minister?

01:20.455 --> 01:21.747
OK.

01:22.540 --> 01:25.876
Have we heard anything from Malcolm
about last night's interview?

01:26.002 --> 01:27.920
No, not yet.

01:28.046 --> 01:31.215
- Perhaps he didn't hear it.
- Or maybe he's dead.

01:31.341 --> 01:32.883
He might be dead!

01:33.009 --> 01:36.386
He might have finally had that
massive stroke he's been heading for.

01:36.513 --> 01:38.722
It's been in the fucking post.

01:38.848 --> 01:42.893
Preventable sickness in many of the
poorest countries around the world.

01:43.019 --> 01:45.229
And of course,
the big one is diarrhoea...

01:45.355 --> 01:49.191
Ah, diarrhoea. This is the Minister
for International Development.

01:49.317 --> 01:51.401
He should be talking about
food parcels,

01:51.528 --> 01:53.779
not fucking arse-spraying mayhem.

01:53.905 --> 01:57.199
So if we can tackle the easy things
like diarrhoea, then we can...

01:57.325 --> 01:59.660
Oh, say it again. Yes, very good.

01:59.786 --> 02:01.787
What is this, the shitting forecast?

02:01.913 --> 02:03.872
...hopefully that will strike another blow

02:03.998 --> 02:05.916
in the war against
preventable diseases.

02:06.042 --> 02:07.918
MAIR... You mentioned the word "war".
- Steady, Eddie.

02:08.044 --> 02:09.877
Against preventable diseases.

02:10.003 --> 02:12.339
All the evidence now points to

02:12.465 --> 02:15.801
a US military intervention
in the Middle East.

02:15.927 --> 02:17.886
Is that your view?

02:18.012 --> 02:21.640
Well, personally,
I think that war is unforeseeable.

02:21.766 --> 02:23.267
Sam. Sam!

02:23.393 --> 02:24.977
Unforeseeable?
Yes.

02:25.103 --> 02:27.938
No, you do not think that!

02:28.064 --> 02:30.149
Sam, I'm going to have to go

02:30.275 --> 02:33.902
to International Development
to pull Simon Foster's fucking hair.

02:34.028 --> 02:35.946
He did not say "unforeseeable".

02:36.072 --> 02:39.032
You may have heard him say that,
but he did not say that.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.617
And that is a fact.

02:40.743 --> 02:42.661
Now, he's gonna want you to row back

02:42.787 --> 02:45.622
on that "unforeseeable" thing
on Question Time tonight.

02:45.748 --> 02:49.793
On Question Time, you know the funny
question they always have at the end?

02:49.919 --> 02:51.170
Yes.

02:51.296 --> 02:53.213
I think we should prep that now.

02:53.339 --> 02:55.632
Cos I'd like to shine on
the funny question.

02:55.758 --> 02:58.010
I'm a funny guy, with a light touch.

02:58.136 --> 03:01.430
There's this guy, he's a property
tycoon. He bought a South Sea island.

03:01.556 --> 03:04.683
It might be something like that.
If you had to spend the rest of your life

03:04.809 --> 03:07.269
on a desert island with someone,
who would it be with?

03:07.395 --> 03:10.022
Well... I can't say my wife
cos I haven't got one.

03:10.148 --> 03:13.734
I can't say my girlfriend, because
I haven't got one of those either.

03:13.860 --> 03:17.654
- And don't say Mandela. That's...
- No, no, boring. And a bloke.

03:17.780 --> 03:19.239
Or Keira Knightley.

03:19.365 --> 03:21.450
That's a good idea.

03:21.576 --> 03:24.203
Pervert. Sex. Minister.
People don't want to know.

03:24.329 --> 03:25.829
I don't think so.

03:25.955 --> 03:28.081
Did you take
the washing out of the machine?

03:28.208 --> 03:29.958
- No.
- What do you mean "no"?

03:30.084 --> 03:32.294
No, I didn't take
the washing out of the machine.

03:32.420 --> 03:34.671
- It's gonna go really stale...
- It'll be fine.

03:34.797 --> 03:37.090
- It's not fine.
- It's fine. I'll wear stale pants.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.509
I don't want to go out
with someone in stale pants.

03:39.636 --> 03:41.678
Well, there we go.
I could go commando.

03:41.804 --> 03:44.264
But I don't think
that's accepted in government.

03:44.390 --> 03:46.850
Have you got everything
you need for your first day?

03:46.976 --> 03:48.894
Oh, yes, all in here.
My massive intellect

03:49.020 --> 03:51.313
and an apple for Simon Foster.

03:51.439 --> 03:53.357
Simon "Fluster", don't you mean?

03:53.483 --> 03:55.692
Don't call him that. I'm rebranding him.

03:55.818 --> 03:58.237
He was absolutely crap
on the radio last night.

03:58.363 --> 04:00.530
He sounded like a chicken
with a wasp up its arse.

04:00.657 --> 04:02.491
You give me a week,
I'll have him sounding

04:02.617 --> 04:04.534
like a chicken
without a wasp up its arse.

04:04.661 --> 04:07.371
Good luck at the Foreign Office.
Try not to annoy Russia.

04:07.497 --> 04:09.373
- See you later.
- See you later.

04:09.499 --> 04:11.875
I'll give you a call later.
Keep your phone on.

04:12.001 --> 04:14.711
- Be careful. Cars.
- Oh, really? Thanks for that.

04:14.837 --> 04:16.880
Helpful...

04:18.257 --> 04:20.591
OK, OK, go ahead
and print "unforeseeable".

04:20.718 --> 04:22.386
Listen, assume I tell your wife

04:22.512 --> 04:25.138
about you and Angela Heaney
at the Blackpool conference,

04:25.265 --> 04:27.766
what would be best,
an e-mail, a phone call or what?

04:27.892 --> 04:30.727
I could write it on a cake!
With those little silver balls.

04:30.853 --> 04:33.605
"Your hack husband
betrayed you on October 4th...

04:33.731 --> 04:35.774
and congratulations on the new baby. "

04:35.900 --> 04:38.235
Yeah,
maybe it's better to spike it, yeah.

04:38.361 --> 04:40.279
OK, fuckity bye.

04:40.405 --> 04:42.614
Did you put away the lasagne?

04:42.740 --> 04:44.741
Yes, of course, it's in the fridge.

04:44.867 --> 04:47.119
It's got Clingfilm on it and everything.

04:47.245 --> 04:49.121
Why did you put Clingfilm on it?

04:49.622 --> 04:52.291
Because that keeps it fresh.
That's the point of Clingfilm.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.126
No, I don't want to hold.

04:54.252 --> 04:55.294
It might dry out.

04:55.420 --> 04:56.586
That's an amateur mistake.

04:56.713 --> 05:00.257
I'm not holding any longer. What's
he waiting for, a fucking sex change?

05:00.383 --> 05:01.591
It's not carcinogenic.

05:01.718 --> 05:03.593
What, Simon Foster?

05:03.720 --> 05:05.595
Clingfilm doesn't give you cancer.

05:05.722 --> 05:07.597
Diarrhoea Of A Nobody. I like that.

05:07.724 --> 05:09.641
- Aluminium foil...
- Apropos of that...

05:09.767 --> 05:12.728
...gives you AIDS, or, you know,
lasagne gives you syphilis.

05:12.854 --> 05:15.439
- It's not a thing.
- No, you relax!

05:15.565 --> 05:17.107
God, who's that?

05:17.233 --> 05:19.151
Get me fucking Brian!

05:19.277 --> 05:22.321
If you don't get me fucking Brian,
I'm gonna come over there.

05:22.447 --> 05:24.573
I'm gonna lock you in
a fucking flotation tank

05:24.699 --> 05:26.992
and pump it full of sewage
until you fucking drown.

05:27.118 --> 05:30.120
- Paris Hilton.
- Are you serious?

05:30.246 --> 05:31.747
- Lily Allen.
- No, no women.

05:33.583 --> 05:35.459
- Yeah?
- The Olsen twins.

05:35.585 --> 05:38.128
- Thank you.
- Who's that?

05:38.254 --> 05:41.631
- Malcolm. He's coming to see you.
- Oh, shit, he's still alive.

05:41.758 --> 05:43.967
- When's he due?
Now!

05:44.093 --> 05:46.887
And don't say you weren't prepared,
because I rang ahead.

05:47.013 --> 05:49.348
Give us a minute,
could you, please, love?

05:49.474 --> 05:53.352
In the words
of the late, great Nat King fucking Cole,

05:53.478 --> 05:55.896
unforeseeable, that's what you are.

05:56.022 --> 05:58.065
Who's that geezer?

05:59.776 --> 06:01.651
Oh, I know who he is.

06:01.778 --> 06:04.112
You're Dan, right?

06:04.238 --> 06:06.573
- Daniel? The new adviser?
- Toby.

06:06.699 --> 06:08.700
Toby. Oh. Sorry about the "Dan" thing.

06:08.826 --> 06:11.787
You guys are often called "Dan"
so it's worth a punt.

06:11.913 --> 06:13.705
I'm Judy, by the way. Judy Molloy.

06:13.831 --> 06:16.625
Director of Communications
for International Development.

06:16.751 --> 06:17.876
Is this a normal morning?

06:18.002 --> 06:20.045
The minister was rubbish
on last night's interview...

06:20.171 --> 06:22.422
- He was rubbish?
- Yes. Rubbish.

06:22.548 --> 06:26.176
Come on, Malcolm, he asked me for...
for a personal opinion.

06:26.302 --> 06:29.596
Why didn't you say? He asked you.
Fuck, of course, that explains it.

06:29.722 --> 06:33.016
If he'd asked you to fucking black up,
or to give him your PIN number

06:33.142 --> 06:35.268
or to shit yourself,
would you have done that?

06:35.395 --> 06:38.021
Blacked up, yes.
It was radio, nobody would've known.

06:38.147 --> 06:39.356
Very good.

06:39.482 --> 06:41.942
War is basically unforeseeable, isn't it?

06:42.068 --> 06:45.237
That is not our line.
Walk the fucking line.

06:45.363 --> 06:48.490
We've got Karen Clark
over from Washington today.

06:48.616 --> 06:51.034
We've got enough
fucking Pentagon goons here

06:51.160 --> 06:52.661
to stage a fucking coup d'Ã©tat.

06:52.787 --> 06:55.038
- Minister.
Not the time, love.

06:55.164 --> 06:57.082
- I'm busy. Fuck off.
- This is Toby.

06:57.208 --> 07:00.544
Toby, hi. I'm glad you could make it.
It's a bit of an odd morning here.

07:00.670 --> 07:03.255
Welcome to the madhouse.
I apologise for Malcolm.

07:03.381 --> 07:06.091
Don't apologise for me.
Apologise for yourself.

07:06.217 --> 07:09.052
Did I not just tell you to fuck off
and yet you're still here?

07:09.178 --> 07:11.054
It's true, I am, yes, still here.

07:11.180 --> 07:12.722
Hi, foetus boy,

07:12.849 --> 07:15.475
lesson one, I tell you to fuck off,
what do you do?

07:15.601 --> 07:17.519
Eff off?

07:17.645 --> 07:19.563
You'll go far.

07:19.689 --> 07:21.648
- Now, fuck off.
- Right.

07:21.774 --> 07:26.736
Judy and I were thinking that I could
row back on Question Time tonight.

07:26.863 --> 07:29.281
You're not on Question Time.
You've been disinvited.

07:29.407 --> 07:33.118
- We've been prepping Question Time.
- Why wasn't I told about this?

07:33.244 --> 07:36.413
Why the fuck would I tell you about it?
I told you to fuck off twice.

07:36.539 --> 07:40.333
It's a scheduled media appearance by
this department's secretary of state

07:40.460 --> 07:42.419
so it falls well within my purview.

07:42.545 --> 07:44.087
- Within your purview?
- Yes.

07:44.213 --> 07:47.799
Where do you think you are, some
fucking Regency costume drama?

07:47.925 --> 07:51.553
This is a government department,
not a fucking Jane fucking Austen novel.

07:51.679 --> 07:54.598
Malcolm...
- Allow me to pop a jaunty little bonnet

07:54.724 --> 07:57.934
on your purview and ram it up
the shitter with a lubricated horse cock.

07:58.060 --> 07:59.978
Your swearing does not impress me.

08:00.104 --> 08:02.898
My husband works for Tower Hamlets
and believe me,

08:03.024 --> 08:05.734
those kids make you sound like...
Angela Lansbury.

08:05.860 --> 08:07.569
She's married? Poor bastard.

08:07.695 --> 08:12.157
Malcolm, Judy's lubricated horse cock
aside for a second,

08:12.283 --> 08:16.036
are you saying I'm now no longer
allowed to make media appearances?

08:16.162 --> 08:18.997
Correct. Not until we can trust you
to keep the line.

08:19.123 --> 08:21.750
I was going to keep to the line.
I was going to say,

08:21.876 --> 08:24.294
I don't think war is unforeseeable...

08:24.420 --> 08:27.339
- What is it, then?
- I dunno. Foreseeable? No.

08:27.465 --> 08:30.342
No! Not foreseeable.
That's fucking declaring war.

08:30.468 --> 08:32.385
Do you want to fucking declare war?

08:32.511 --> 08:35.554
I'm a Cabinet minister.
I didn't get here by screwing up

08:35.681 --> 08:37.933
every media appearance I ever had.

08:38.058 --> 08:41.061
Write this down. It's neither
foreseeable nor unforeseeable.

08:41.187 --> 08:44.063
Right, so not inevitable, but not...

08:44.190 --> 08:46.274
You'd better walk on this fucking line.

08:46.400 --> 08:47.859
...evitable.

08:47.985 --> 08:51.780
You, hey, put the snifter out there
that if the BBC ambushes a minister

08:51.906 --> 08:55.158
with another surprise question about
the war, I'll drop a bomb on them.

08:55.284 --> 08:57.202
I can't do that, can I? That's political.

08:57.328 --> 09:00.539
Does that not fit within your purview,
Marie Antoinette?

09:00.665 --> 09:03.333
Why don't you just scuttle off back
to fucking Cranford

09:03.459 --> 09:06.836
and play around with your tea and your
cakes and your fucking horse cocks.

09:06.963 --> 09:10.715
Let them eat cock! Hey, you!
Ron Weasley, you do it.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.970
No, no, you needn't worry about
the Canadians,

09:15.096 --> 09:17.013
they're just happy to be there.

09:17.139 --> 09:20.642
Yes, well, they always look surprised
when they're invited.

09:20.768 --> 09:23.562
Shall I just give Toby a call
about this Simon Foster thing?

09:23.688 --> 09:26.022
Yes, good idea.
No, I'm not talking to you.

09:26.148 --> 09:28.191
Get me the Angolan chargÃ© d'affaires.

09:28.317 --> 09:31.027
Yes, well stop him playing football.

09:31.862 --> 09:33.238
Hello.

09:33.364 --> 09:35.407
So, how's it going? Found the bogs?

09:35.533 --> 09:37.450
It's a bit... manic.

09:37.577 --> 09:41.830
Never like this at Agriculture. People
tend not to get so sweary about wheat.

09:41.956 --> 09:44.708
Sorry, Michael, do you mind
just turning it down a bit?

09:44.834 --> 09:48.378
Just a little bit... grating. Bloody music.

09:48.504 --> 09:51.214
Listen,
I've got a bit of leg-up for you, actually.

09:51.340 --> 09:55.885
Yeah. I think we can get Simon Foster
into the three o'clock with Karen Clark.

09:56.012 --> 09:57.721
Karen Clark?

09:57.847 --> 10:01.224
Was she the woman who went round
Britain in a coracle for leukaemia?

10:01.350 --> 10:04.436
No, Toby. Karen Clark,
US Assistant Secretary of State.

10:04.562 --> 10:07.439
Oh, right, Karen Clark. Wow, great.

10:07.565 --> 10:10.233
- Michael wants to say something.
- Meat.

10:10.359 --> 10:11.901
Meat?

10:12.028 --> 10:16.239
His man is only going to be meat in
the room. No talking. He's just padding.

10:16.365 --> 10:19.284
The Americans don't feel like
they're getting a proper meeting

10:19.410 --> 10:21.953
unless there's 30 people on each side,

10:22.079 --> 10:24.289
so he's basically like bulk in the room.

10:24.415 --> 10:27.083
He's not exactly going to be relevant,
but he'll be present.

10:27.209 --> 10:28.918
I won't tell him that, to be honest.

10:29.045 --> 10:32.380
- OK, I've got to go, darling. I love you.
- OK, yes, likewise.

10:32.506 --> 10:34.174
Affirmative on that one.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.593
All right, darling, take care, bye.

10:36.719 --> 10:39.095
Can I turn it back up now?

10:39.221 --> 10:42.140
You're on sexual health, aren't you?
That's ironic.

10:42.266 --> 10:44.184
Right, Toby, quick tour.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.936
- I should probably just go and...
- This is Mike.

10:47.063 --> 10:49.856
Just leave it to Mike,
cos he knows what he's doing.

10:49.982 --> 10:51.900
- Don't you, Mike?
- What?

10:52.026 --> 10:54.486
Exactly. He's an idiot.

10:54.612 --> 10:58.323
Listen, I understand your hostility
at new wood being brought in.

10:58.449 --> 11:00.659
Sorry, that's the end of the tour,
I'm afraid.

11:00.785 --> 11:04.913
There is really a lot of very important
people that you ought to know about,

11:05.039 --> 11:06.956
but I have to...

11:11.921 --> 11:13.797
- Toby, hi.
- All right, boss.

11:13.923 --> 11:16.341
I'm sorry about earlier. Malcolm.

11:16.467 --> 11:18.968
- He's a bit of an alpha male, isn't he?
- Yes.

11:19.095 --> 11:20.970
Listen,

11:21.097 --> 11:22.972
I was just um...

11:23.099 --> 11:24.974
- Don't sit on Anna's desk.
- Sorry.

11:25.101 --> 11:31.022
I have managed to get you into the big
Foreign Office meeting this afternoon.

11:31.148 --> 11:33.775
The Karen Clark meeting?
Really? Shit.

11:33.901 --> 11:35.443
How did you do that?

11:35.569 --> 11:38.154
I did it through sheer bloody hard work.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.989
- Judy?
- Yeah?

11:40.116 --> 11:44.494
Tobes here has got me into the big
Karen Clark meeting this afternoon.

11:44.620 --> 11:45.954
Oh!

11:46.080 --> 11:47.997
The big "meat".

11:48.124 --> 11:51.000
Impressive, eh?
How are you spelling that, by the way?

11:51.127 --> 11:53.002
Two "E"s.

11:53.129 --> 11:54.337
Oh, right.

11:54.463 --> 11:56.339
Just one thing.

11:56.465 --> 12:00.802
Talkingwise, you might find once
we get in there, that the bulk of it...

12:00.928 --> 12:03.012
- Can we just wait for Judy?
- Of course.

12:03.139 --> 12:05.181
Simon.

12:05.307 --> 12:06.391
Michael, hi.

12:06.517 --> 12:08.393
Hello. Welcome.

12:08.519 --> 12:10.228
- Michael?
- Yes.

12:10.354 --> 12:13.940
I'm Chad. We'd like a dual horseshoe
formation for the meeting set-up.

12:14.066 --> 12:17.527
An enclave for Ms Clark. An enclave
for the Pentagon delegation.

12:17.653 --> 12:19.779
And, politely, we request the presence

12:19.905 --> 12:22.407
of both carbonated
and non-carbonated waters.

12:22.533 --> 12:24.284
Right.

12:24.410 --> 12:26.745
- Is that all?
- Yeah, that's it. Thank you so much.

12:26.871 --> 12:29.914
Not at all. Wow, who was that?
Young Lankenstein?

12:30.958 --> 12:33.835
He's probably running
something relatively major.

12:33.961 --> 12:35.879
They're all kids in Washington.

12:36.005 --> 12:38.965
It's like Bugsy Malone,
but with real guns.

12:43.179 --> 12:45.013
Thank you all for coming today

12:45.139 --> 12:47.766
to the Interim Anglo-American
Resources Forum.

12:47.892 --> 12:49.726
I'd particularly like to welcome...

12:49.852 --> 12:51.853
What's your view like?

12:51.979 --> 12:54.522
- Well, it's pretty basic.
- OK, can we swap?

12:54.648 --> 12:57.650
I don't want a consensus
forming around the premise

12:57.777 --> 13:02.572
that military action is necessarily
the primary option at this point.

13:02.698 --> 13:06.910
This paper which was authored
by one of my aides, Liza Weld...

13:07.036 --> 13:10.079
Liza, I hope you don't mind
if I foreground this paper.

13:10.206 --> 13:12.624
It's not strictly my paper.

13:12.750 --> 13:16.002
In the sense that you were the one
who put in the requests...

13:16.128 --> 13:19.589
Miss Weld is very, very modest,
but this is her paper.

13:19.715 --> 13:22.634
And she's highlighted several reasons

13:22.760 --> 13:26.930
why we cannot envision a theatre
deployment for at least 12 months.

13:27.056 --> 13:30.600
Should I say something? She invited
me. I should say something.

13:30.726 --> 13:32.936
If you don't say something
in the first ten minutes,

13:33.062 --> 13:35.104
then you might as well
not say anything at all.

13:35.231 --> 13:37.273
I really think
you shouldn't say anything.

13:37.399 --> 13:40.819
- No, I should say something.
- No, Simon, don't, just don't...

13:40.945 --> 13:42.654
Don't pull my hand down.

13:42.780 --> 13:45.657
The committee feels
a quicker deployment is possible.

13:45.783 --> 13:47.033
Ah, which committee?

13:47.159 --> 13:49.494
It was discussed
in a number of committees.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.955
- If I mentioned one committee...
- You did.

13:52.081 --> 13:53.957
...then it was a slip of the tongue.

13:54.083 --> 13:57.794
What, because you've accidentally
alluded to a secret committee,

13:57.920 --> 13:59.462
a war committee?

13:59.588 --> 14:03.299
If I may intercept. I understand
we are rather pressed for time.

14:03.425 --> 14:06.386
Liza, do you know if Linton
has set up a secret war committee?

14:06.512 --> 14:08.721
- No. I have no idea.
- Get me on it.

14:08.848 --> 14:12.141
I think it's worth noting
that ministers in the UK government,

14:12.268 --> 14:15.520
such as our colleague here,
Simon Foster,

14:15.646 --> 14:20.483
have made it very clear that they feel
currently war is unforeseeable.

14:20.609 --> 14:23.361
Isn't that right, Simon?

14:24.446 --> 14:26.322
Er... well, yes.

14:26.448 --> 14:28.825
That's... That's what I said.

14:28.951 --> 14:31.452
And I stick to what I said.

14:33.914 --> 14:39.168
That doesn't mean that what I said
won't change... in the future.

14:39.295 --> 14:41.170
Um... it's not immutable

14:41.297 --> 14:43.214
or mutable.

14:43.340 --> 14:45.300
It's... It's... It's...

14:45.426 --> 14:47.343
It's a developing...

14:47.469 --> 14:49.888
I think there are
areas of mutual discussion

14:50.014 --> 14:54.100
that we could come onto now, and then
maybe if there's time left at the end...

14:54.226 --> 14:57.353
Judy, can you just pass that on?
Is that fine?

14:57.479 --> 15:00.398
Yes, that's all fine, thank you.

15:02.484 --> 15:07.113
Right, come here. We need to talk.
What do you mean, "Stop being a tit?"

15:07.239 --> 15:09.157
In what way was I being a tit?

15:09.283 --> 15:11.117
Why am I even over here?

15:11.243 --> 15:13.536
You were just meat in the room, Simon.

15:13.662 --> 15:15.580
- Yeah...
- Meat in the room?

15:15.706 --> 15:17.582
Yeah.

15:17.708 --> 15:21.127
For fuck's sake, Judy, I've taken
an hour out to come over here

15:21.253 --> 15:22.921
and be room meat.

15:23.047 --> 15:24.964
Yes, but... but a prime cut,

15:25.090 --> 15:26.591
you know, not offal.

15:26.717 --> 15:28.676
Oh, great. I'm not liver.

15:28.802 --> 15:30.720
What was I, tit meat?

15:30.846 --> 15:32.764
Well, no, I just...

15:32.890 --> 15:36.225
Come on. Let's get back.

15:36.352 --> 15:38.227
- Hey, Liza.
- Hey.

15:38.354 --> 15:41.773
I just want to say congratulations.
Your paper got a major citation.

15:41.899 --> 15:44.484
You must be psyched
that Karen brought it up.

15:44.610 --> 15:47.612
Yeah, well, that was,
you know, her call. Not mine.

15:47.738 --> 15:48.905
You couldn't write a paper

15:49.031 --> 15:52.241
that clashes more violently with
the current climate if you were trying.

15:52.368 --> 15:54.077
It seems like you almost were trying.

15:54.203 --> 15:57.413
- I wasn't trying! Believe me.
- You're like the woman in The Omen.

15:57.539 --> 16:00.083
You've given birth to a demon
and now it's gonna kill you.

16:00.209 --> 16:02.961
You probably identify
with the kid from The Omen.

16:03.087 --> 16:05.505
See, you're an only child, aren't you?

16:05.631 --> 16:07.507
I don't understand how my parents'

16:07.633 --> 16:10.593
limited reproductive ability
reflects badly on me.

16:10.719 --> 16:12.762
I'm the sperm that made it, so...

16:12.888 --> 16:14.931
- Liza.
- I'm being called by our boss.

16:15.057 --> 16:17.976
- OK, retreat. See you later.
- Yeah, have fun with yourself.

16:18.102 --> 16:20.228
Have fun with your career kryptonite.

16:21.230 --> 16:24.065
What's going on down there?
That looks important.

16:24.191 --> 16:26.401
My teeth are killing me.
Are they chipped?

16:26.527 --> 16:28.945
I think that one
has always been there, right?

16:29.071 --> 16:31.614
It was a chip on the veneer.

16:31.740 --> 16:35.076
- Don't look at my teeth for a long time.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

16:35.202 --> 16:37.245
- It just surprised me.
Liza!

16:37.371 --> 16:38.454
Toby.

16:38.580 --> 16:40.790
Toby! Hi.

16:40.916 --> 16:42.834
- Hi.
- Give me a call!

16:42.960 --> 16:45.461
- Yeah.
- OK.

16:45.587 --> 16:49.298
Liza Weld. She did the
Kennedy Scholarship at my college.

16:49.425 --> 16:52.343
- I had a little thing for her at the time.
- I can imagine, yeah.

16:52.469 --> 16:54.554
Don't think she remembered me,
to be honest.

16:54.680 --> 16:57.015
That is one
of the side-effects of Rohypnol.

16:58.017 --> 17:01.477
Linton has set up
a secret war committee. I just know it.

17:01.603 --> 17:04.771
I mean, Linton is an absolute lunatic,
Liza.

17:04.897 --> 17:06.315
- He is dangerous.
- It's not good.

17:06.442 --> 17:08.859
The voices in his head
now sing barbershop together.

17:10.570 --> 17:13.865
I really, really hope there isn't a war,
it's going to be a nightmare.

17:13.991 --> 17:16.659
It's bad enough having to cope
with the fucking Olympics.

17:16.785 --> 17:19.078
- Minister?
- Just a quick word, sir?

17:19.204 --> 17:22.040
This is your chance to nail the line.
Do you want to nail the line?

17:22.165 --> 17:24.584
No, I'll freestyle it.
Hello, there. Hi.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.711
So is war unforeseeable, Minister?

17:26.837 --> 17:31.299
Look, all sorts of things,
that are actually very likely

17:31.425 --> 17:33.509
are also unforeseeable.

17:33.635 --> 17:39.265
For the plane in the fog,
the mountain is un... unforeseeable,

17:39.391 --> 17:43.603
but then it is suddenly
very real and inevitable.

17:43.729 --> 17:47.065
Is this your opinion or is this
the government position?

17:47.191 --> 17:48.733
The mountain in the metaphor is

17:48.859 --> 17:52.153
a completely hypothetical mountain
that could represent anything.

17:52.279 --> 17:54.530
So, who is the plane,
and who is the mountain?

17:54.656 --> 17:57.241
- Is the government lost in the fog?
- What I'm saying is...

17:57.367 --> 17:59.368
that to walk the road of peace...

17:59.495 --> 18:05.291
sometimes we need to be ready
to climb... the mountain of conflict.

18:05.417 --> 18:07.126
Thank you so much.

18:07.252 --> 18:10.713
Thank you. That's it,
ladies and gentlemen, thank you.

18:10.839 --> 18:14.592
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
why didn't we nail the line?

18:14.718 --> 18:16.636
Simon, I did try to warn you.

18:16.762 --> 18:19.764
Yes, you tried to warn me, but
you didn't actually stop me, did you?

18:19.890 --> 18:21.682
I can't tackle you to the ground.

18:21.809 --> 18:25.269
That's like shouting "Train!"
At somebody as they get hit by a train.

18:25.395 --> 18:27.772
You should go "Train!
There's a fucking train!"

18:27.898 --> 18:29.649
Bollocks!

18:29.775 --> 18:32.401
- Fuck, it's Malcolm.
- It's Malcolm for me, too.

18:32.528 --> 18:34.445
How does he do that?

18:34.571 --> 18:38.658
Simon, I don't like finding out about
people employed by this government

18:38.784 --> 18:40.993
via the news, unless they've just died.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.328
Be here, now.

18:42.454 --> 18:44.330
The British Government
must be prepared

18:44.456 --> 18:45.915
to climb the mountain of conflict.

18:46.041 --> 18:48.459
It's unclear if his view
is shared by the Prime Minister.

18:48.585 --> 18:50.336
Maybe we should get it out there.

18:50.462 --> 18:53.673
Float the idea that the war
is a resigning issue for you.

18:53.799 --> 18:56.968
You can't say it's a resigning issue,
because then you have to resign.

18:57.094 --> 19:00.138
You're having a really great first day,
you know that?

19:00.264 --> 19:02.974
You are supposed to be
a Cabinet minister!

19:03.100 --> 19:05.935
You are supposed to be Officer Class!

19:06.061 --> 19:08.980
Don't do this,
don't make fucking waves.

19:09.106 --> 19:11.399
We can do without
the ritual humiliation.

19:11.525 --> 19:13.359
You know I'm against
talking up the war.

19:13.485 --> 19:14.986
You're against talking up the war?

19:15.112 --> 19:17.738
Is that why you said
"climb the mountain of conflict"?

19:17.865 --> 19:19.365
Do you know what you sounded like?

19:19.491 --> 19:21.784
A fucking Nazi Julie Andrews.

19:21.910 --> 19:27.331
I'm just saying I might be forced
to the verge of making a stand.

19:27.457 --> 19:29.500
A stand?

19:31.503 --> 19:34.213
Right, The White Stripes, outside.

19:34.339 --> 19:36.174
Uh-uh.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.802
There's only two people
in The White Stripes.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.602
I um...

19:49.396 --> 19:51.189
I admire you.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.192
I really do, I admire you.

19:54.318 --> 19:56.277
Making a stand.

19:56.403 --> 20:01.240
So, I take it, I can tell the PM that you...
you don't want to go to Washington?

20:01.366 --> 20:03.576
- To where?
- To Washington.

20:03.702 --> 20:06.287
See, the PM, he wants you...
Well, he wanted you

20:06.413 --> 20:08.372
to go on a fact-finder, you know.

20:08.498 --> 20:12.376
Problems we might have to face if it
all goes boombastic in the Middle East.

20:12.502 --> 20:14.212
Oh, right.

20:14.338 --> 20:17.465
But, you know, that's you,
you're on the verge, aren't you?

20:17.591 --> 20:20.051
You're on the verge of your stand, so...

20:20.177 --> 20:21.886
Well, Malcolm, come on,

20:22.012 --> 20:25.056
I don't know what words I used
in the heat of the moment.

20:25.182 --> 20:28.559
Maybe in a sense, yeah, I am on the
verge, but that's the important thing.

20:28.685 --> 20:32.271
I'm on the verge.
I'm not in any way decided.

20:32.397 --> 20:35.066
Christ on a bendy-bus.
Don't be such a fucking faff arse.

20:35.192 --> 20:38.069
No, I'm standing my ground,
on the verge.

20:38.195 --> 20:40.446
Right, OK,
well, when you go to America,

20:40.572 --> 20:42.907
talk to Karen Clark
at the State Department, yeah?

20:43.033 --> 20:46.077
- Right, OK. I'll give it a whirl.
- Keep away from Linton Barwick.

20:46.203 --> 20:48.120
He's pushing the war
for Caulderwood's lot.

20:48.247 --> 20:51.916
I'll deal with him. He uses a live hand
grenade as a fucking paper weight.

20:52.042 --> 20:53.751
That's a true story.

20:53.877 --> 20:56.087
Wow, I won't talk to him.

20:56.213 --> 20:59.632
Talk to as few people as possible,
that would be best for you.

21:00.467 --> 21:04.762
OK, Liza, the priorities are shower,
get me on Linton's war committee

21:04.888 --> 21:08.266
and get me to a dentist,
not necessarily in that order.

21:08.392 --> 21:10.142
Shower later.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.561
What has Linton been up to
while we've been gone?

21:12.688 --> 21:14.772
Have we declared war
on California yet?

21:14.898 --> 21:16.524
Ah, Karen.

21:16.650 --> 21:19.527
- How was London? Good meetings?
- Very good meetings.

21:19.653 --> 21:22.947
You know we had some
great discussions there, I think our...

21:23.073 --> 21:26.325
Thank you very much, and I will read
your words when they come through.

21:26.451 --> 21:28.369
Thank you so much, Karen, hm. Bob.

21:28.495 --> 21:30.538
You won't read the words, Linton.

21:31.915 --> 21:33.582
Is Chad coming? Chad?

21:33.709 --> 21:36.919
No, he's probably doing
his desperate chorus girl thing,

21:37.045 --> 21:41.465
hanging around Linton's office,
trying to catch an eye, you know.

21:41.591 --> 21:44.802
That's why he's wearing his
push-up bra today. Have you noticed?

21:44.928 --> 21:47.763
- Assistant Secretary of State, hi.
- Brad, how are you?

21:47.889 --> 21:49.598
- Chad.
- Yep, yep, yep, exactly.

21:49.725 --> 21:52.643
- Can I...?
- Yep, you betcha, OK.

21:53.562 --> 21:55.479
Hey, listen, the war committee.

21:55.605 --> 21:57.523
What you have to do
is you've got to look for

21:57.649 --> 22:00.985
the ten dullest-named committees
happening out of the executive branch.

22:01.111 --> 22:04.780
Because Linton is not going to call it
the "Big Horrible War Committee".

22:04.906 --> 22:08.117
He's gonna hide it
behind a name like "Diverse Strategy".

22:08.243 --> 22:11.162
Something so dull
you're just gonna want to self-harm.

22:11.288 --> 22:14.332
Get me General Miller
at the Pentagon, please.

22:14.458 --> 22:16.500
My teeth hurt.

22:16.626 --> 22:18.794
My teeth hurt like hell.

22:19.379 --> 22:22.048
I'm sick of hearing about
the teeth, frankly.

22:23.300 --> 22:26.135
Hi, yeah.
I'm checking the status on a paper

22:26.261 --> 22:28.012
that was circulated by a staffer here.

22:28.138 --> 22:29.680
It's called...

22:29.806 --> 22:34.185
"Post War Planning. Parameters,
Implications and Possibilities".

22:34.311 --> 22:38.689
This is the one by...
this is the one by Liza Weld, right?

22:38.815 --> 22:40.900
"PWIP PIP"?

22:41.026 --> 22:43.027
Oh, God, it already has an acronym.

22:43.153 --> 22:45.738
You know another acronym? DOA...

22:45.864 --> 22:48.199
Your career.

22:48.325 --> 22:54.372
My golly, I can't see why anyone would
choose to work in a glass office, huh?

22:54.498 --> 22:58.417
Glass offices,
in my opinion, are for perverts.

22:58.543 --> 23:00.419
I could request the glass be frosted.

23:00.545 --> 23:02.380
Frosting is on cakes, huh?

23:02.506 --> 23:05.466
Now, what else happened in London?

23:05.592 --> 23:08.052
Ah, generally positive, two glitches...

23:08.178 --> 23:09.720
Really, what?

23:09.846 --> 23:12.390
Karen flagged a report
by one of her staffers.

23:12.516 --> 23:17.436
She's obviously trying to use it as some
kind of roadblock. It's called PWIP PIP.

23:17.562 --> 23:19.897
- PWIP what?
- PWIP PIP.

23:20.023 --> 23:23.025
What is it, a report on bird calls?
What does it even stand for?

23:23.151 --> 23:26.654
I can't recall. It's factish.
Intel for and against intervention.

23:26.780 --> 23:30.741
We have all the facts on this we need.
We don't need any more facts.

23:30.867 --> 23:32.993
In the land of truth, my friend...

23:34.037 --> 23:36.205
...the man with one fact is the king.

23:36.331 --> 23:39.208
You said there was something else,
what is that?

23:39.334 --> 23:41.502
In the meeting with the Foreign Office,

23:41.628 --> 23:44.880
the committee was accidentally
and briefly alluded to.

23:45.006 --> 23:46.632
Which committee?

23:46.758 --> 23:48.926
The... The war committee, sir.

23:49.052 --> 23:52.096
All right,
Karen is not to know about this, huh?

23:52.222 --> 23:55.808
She is an excitable, yapping she-dog.

23:55.934 --> 23:58.519
Get a hold of those minutes.
I have to correct the record.

23:58.645 --> 24:00.771
- We can do that?
- Yes, we can.

24:00.897 --> 24:03.107
Those minutes are an aide-mÃ©moire
for us.

24:03.233 --> 24:07.987
They should not be a reductive record
of what happened to have been said,

24:08.113 --> 24:12.074
but they should be more a full record of
what was intended to have been said.

24:12.200 --> 24:15.119
I think that's the more accurate version,
don't you?

24:15.245 --> 24:16.829
- Sir.
- Right.

24:16.955 --> 24:19.498
I don't like this section, let's cut that.

24:19.624 --> 24:21.500
Aye aye, sir.

24:21.626 --> 24:23.002
Let's reverse this.

24:23.128 --> 24:25.045
That was something Karen said, sir.

24:25.172 --> 24:27.339
Well, it's not right, so let's change it.

24:27.466 --> 24:30.259
- Aye, aye, sir.
- And... And I like... I like this.

24:30.385 --> 24:32.052
Ah, thank you, sir.

24:32.179 --> 24:34.680
Yeah, let's say
everyone agreed with that, huh?

24:34.806 --> 24:39.143
So... So the car
will pick you up from the airport.

24:39.269 --> 24:41.520
It's supposed to be
quite a good one, I believe.

24:41.646 --> 24:44.523
The Americans are doing that.
I've just got the contact numbers.

24:44.649 --> 24:46.692
What's she so fucking happy about?

24:46.818 --> 24:48.777
She's probably just on a personal call.

24:50.906 --> 24:53.157
Why has she got control of the blinds?

24:53.283 --> 24:54.325
I think it's...

24:54.451 --> 24:59.163
I'm a government minister and
I don't have control of my own blinds.

24:59.289 --> 25:03.501
I could order you some blinds. I could
order you some nice, heavy curtains,

25:03.627 --> 25:05.836
with swags and a pelmet maybe.

25:05.962 --> 25:08.547
Yes, do that.

25:08.673 --> 25:10.508
OK.

25:11.510 --> 25:13.511
Will you come with me?

25:20.852 --> 25:25.064
So, listen... my team for the US,
Team Simon...

25:25.190 --> 25:28.859
I'm thinking of taking you
and leaving Judy.

25:29.903 --> 25:31.529
I could work with that, definitely.

25:31.655 --> 25:33.322
Plus, she can be a bit, you know...

25:33.448 --> 25:35.991
"Everything's a bit shit, isn't it?"
Like that.

25:36.117 --> 25:37.910
Yeah, it's true. No, she can be,

25:38.036 --> 25:42.206
"Oh, so you're the President and
I'm supposed to be impressed by that?"

25:42.332 --> 25:45.334
"My husband works in Tower Hamlets.
Meh, meh, meh. "

25:45.460 --> 25:47.795
"Which is much harder
than being President. "

25:47.921 --> 25:51.632
Yeah, OK. Well, that's settled. Fuck it,
she's staying here. Go and tell her.

25:51.758 --> 25:53.342
What?

25:53.468 --> 25:56.720
Well, that moves us on
to any other business.

25:56.846 --> 26:00.391
I think I've flagged everything
that I need to discuss, as I usually do.

26:00.517 --> 26:02.434
Everything you're preparedto discuss.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.019
What is that? What are you doing?

26:04.145 --> 26:07.856
I understand you've started a new
committee, Linton. What is that called?

26:07.983 --> 26:09.400
What makes you think that?

26:09.526 --> 26:11.735
It was mentioned
at our meeting in London.

26:11.861 --> 26:13.195
Well, you must have misheard me.

26:13.321 --> 26:15.656
No. I misheard the word "committee"?

26:15.782 --> 26:17.741
Maybe it was another word.

26:17.867 --> 26:19.743
Like, say, Khomeini.

26:19.869 --> 26:23.247
- You're sitting on a new Khomeini?
- Possibly. There are a lot of words.

26:23.373 --> 26:25.416
Kansas City. Kitty.

26:25.542 --> 26:27.209
- Itty.
- "Itty?"

26:27.335 --> 26:28.627
"Itty" is not a word, Bob.

26:28.753 --> 26:31.380
- Commissary.
- Thank you, James...

26:31.506 --> 26:33.799
Why don't you just recap for me,
at the moment,

26:33.925 --> 26:36.260
all the committees
that you're currently sitting on?

26:36.386 --> 26:40.431
I'm sorry, Karen, but you... you appear
to be bleeding from the teeth.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.267
Let me see that. Holy Mother of...

26:43.393 --> 26:45.894
Well, don't try to change the subject.

26:46.021 --> 26:48.814
I'm sorry, everyone. I'm sorry.
Just ignore the blood.

26:48.940 --> 26:52.192
- We haven't finished the meeting.
- I can't ignore... I'm sorry.

26:52.319 --> 26:54.695
I don't mean to be rude,
but this is a tad repulsive.

26:54.821 --> 26:58.282
I'm sorry. Excuse me.
Liza, come with me, I need you.

26:58.408 --> 26:59.450
Chad, stay here.

26:59.576 --> 27:02.286
Go, Buffy, you belong
to the vampire queen now.

27:02.412 --> 27:04.288
- Liza.
- I'm coming.

27:04.414 --> 27:07.291
Oh, my God. Shit! He's in there alone.

27:07.417 --> 27:09.835
I cannot stand to see
a woman bleed from the mouth.

27:09.961 --> 27:14.214
It reminds me of country and western
music, which I cannot abide. Huh?

27:14.341 --> 27:17.217
That stuff is just choking the airwaves.

27:17.344 --> 27:19.678
- Look, sorry, we just need...
- Oh, my God!

27:19.804 --> 27:23.015
- It's really bad. It's really bad.
- I can't touch anything...

27:23.141 --> 27:25.809
- Nobody was joking.
- It's... I need to catch it.

27:25.935 --> 27:27.895
How far are you with the committees?

27:28.021 --> 27:29.730
I've got it down to two, actually.

27:29.856 --> 27:32.650
One is the "Aims and
Policy Alignment Committee".

27:32.776 --> 27:34.943
The other is the
"Future Planning Committee".

27:35.070 --> 27:37.488
It's not the first one,
because I set that up.

27:37.614 --> 27:40.949
Does it really sound dull to you?
I thought it was a good name.

27:41.076 --> 27:44.119
Right, no... it is a good name.

27:44.245 --> 27:47.748
Well, find out if it really is the...
"Future Planning Committee".

27:47.874 --> 27:50.000
Find out if it really is that.

27:50.126 --> 27:53.837
Um... OK, well, I might go and do that.

27:53.963 --> 27:56.757
You're not going to shout at me
if I go and do that, are you?

27:56.883 --> 27:58.842
I'm not a monster, Liza. OK?

27:58.968 --> 28:02.179
Will you stop implying
that I'm some kind of monster?

28:04.516 --> 28:06.350
Bob!

28:06.476 --> 28:08.352
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

28:08.478 --> 28:12.356
I wanted to tell you
we're having this stupid

28:12.482 --> 28:15.901
"hunk of the month of the office"
kind of contest.

28:16.027 --> 28:19.947
And I just didn't want, you know,
you to feel objectified in any way,

28:20.073 --> 28:22.324
- or anything like that.
- No, not at all.

28:22.450 --> 28:25.244
And Karen knows about
the Future Planning Committee.

28:27.414 --> 28:29.540
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

28:29.666 --> 28:31.750
- No?
- No.

28:31.876 --> 28:33.711
Excuse me.

28:36.756 --> 28:39.717
Future Planning Committee,
that's what it is.

28:45.765 --> 28:47.725
Wow!

28:47.851 --> 28:49.768
This is fucking cool.

28:49.894 --> 28:52.813
Don't be callow, Toby,
we're on official business.

28:52.939 --> 28:55.482
- This way, gentlemen.
- Oh, thanks.

28:58.111 --> 29:00.571
That was a little bit fucking cool.

29:00.697 --> 29:02.072
Yep.

29:02.198 --> 29:04.783
- Did you book a car?
- Me? No.

29:04.909 --> 29:07.619
Well, Judy will have booked a car.

29:07.746 --> 29:08.996
Judy?

29:09.122 --> 29:11.415
- Hi.
- For fuck's sake!

29:11.541 --> 29:13.417
I was wondering
what the car situation is?

29:13.543 --> 29:16.545
It's Robbie's job to book it
and your job to check it.

29:16.671 --> 29:20.257
There's obviously...
some snarl-up at her end, I think.

29:20.383 --> 29:22.426
"Simon Forester. "

29:23.803 --> 29:25.345
Thank you very much.

29:25.472 --> 29:28.390
"England Government,
Simon Forester. "

29:28.516 --> 29:30.809
My name's Simon Foster,
it's British Government.

29:34.814 --> 29:37.608
Hey, Gav, I'm in a fucking motorcade.

29:37.734 --> 29:39.151
Yeah.

29:39.986 --> 29:42.780
I feel like we should have hookers,
do you know what I mean?

29:42.906 --> 29:44.948
I mean in here... now.

29:52.624 --> 29:56.835
- Do you want girls?
- No, no, no, no, no, no. Absolutely not.

29:56.961 --> 29:59.838
No, sorry.
No hookers, it was just a joke.

30:01.174 --> 30:05.177
I hate hookers. Not in
an aggressive way, but, no, thank you.

30:06.805 --> 30:08.639
Strange hotel.

30:08.765 --> 30:12.226
It's like a hangar
for businessmen, isn't it?

30:13.228 --> 30:15.103
- That's better, isn't it?
- It's big, yeah.

30:15.230 --> 30:17.272
Just bring them here, that's fine.

30:20.401 --> 30:23.070
Tobes, have you got any m...

30:24.155 --> 30:27.616
Well, I haven't been to an ATM,
so I've not... I've only got English.

30:27.742 --> 30:29.910
I mean,
I don't suppose English money is...

30:30.036 --> 30:31.995
This and this, sorry that's...

30:32.121 --> 30:34.164
It's usually a dollar a bag.

30:38.169 --> 30:40.045
Ooh, well, there's the Capitol,

30:40.171 --> 30:42.673
you can see there through
that window and that tree.

30:42.799 --> 30:46.385
Technically,
you've got a Capitol Hill view.

30:55.562 --> 30:56.520
Hi.

30:56.646 --> 30:58.689
Excuse me.

30:58.815 --> 31:00.315
Hello. How are you doing?

31:00.441 --> 31:02.860
Was it something I said?
I haven't seen you in a month.

31:02.986 --> 31:05.237
I haven't felt that in years. Thank you.

31:05.363 --> 31:06.530
You're beautiful.

31:06.656 --> 31:09.658
Oh, thank you.
I'm sure you say that to all the girls.

31:09.784 --> 31:13.078
Yes, I do...
and some of the soldiers, too.

31:13.204 --> 31:15.873
That's why you shouldn't
run for office, bimbo eruptions.

31:15.999 --> 31:18.750
Come on, don't believe that shit.
I'm not gonna run for office.

31:18.877 --> 31:21.253
I'm just trying to do something different.

31:21.379 --> 31:23.088
It's one of the reasons I like you.

31:23.214 --> 31:25.716
I know your passion
about education and housing and...

31:25.842 --> 31:28.385
- Lingerie. Bestiality.
- There you go.

31:28.511 --> 31:30.721
I'd forgotten about that.

31:30.847 --> 31:33.098
Are you still allergic to the dog?

31:33.224 --> 31:36.518
Yes, yes, I wake up and my eyes
are closed and my head is swollen

31:36.644 --> 31:38.478
and I look like a giant ball sac.

31:38.605 --> 31:40.272
Oh, my God. You know,

31:40.398 --> 31:43.400
they do have modern medication
for that sort of thing.

31:43.526 --> 31:45.736
- Beautiful ball sac, though.
- Thank you very much.

31:45.862 --> 31:48.113
- How's the Pentagon?
- It's kicked up a little.

31:48.239 --> 31:50.741
They're talking invasion
reasonably seriously.

31:50.867 --> 31:53.076
Is there somewhere
we can talk about this?

31:53.202 --> 31:55.120
- I don't know.
- There must be.

31:55.246 --> 31:57.539
- I don't live here.
- Follow me.

31:57.665 --> 32:00.584
- Go that way.
- Don't let people know we're leaving.

32:00.710 --> 32:03.754
This is good. Her daughter's not home,
I talked to her.

32:03.880 --> 32:05.756
- In here?
- Yeah.

32:05.882 --> 32:09.760
Although, I don't know what we'll say
if somebody comes in right now.

32:09.886 --> 32:12.262
No, I can't think
of a good possible excuse, no.

32:12.388 --> 32:14.014
No, me neither, me neither.

32:14.140 --> 32:15.807
- What?
- Come here.

32:15.934 --> 32:17.935
Just be careful, don't mess stuff up.

32:18.061 --> 32:21.521
- Oh, come on, it's toys.
- Let's sit down.

32:21.648 --> 32:23.690
- So...
- Yeah.

32:24.692 --> 32:26.443
Not enough troops.

32:26.569 --> 32:28.779
Total minimum
European Theatre requirement.

32:28.905 --> 32:30.822
The Far East, Asia.

32:30.949 --> 32:33.450
- OK. That's how many we have?
- Total there, yes.

32:33.576 --> 32:35.953
And then we have the contingency
already deployed.

32:36.079 --> 32:38.038
OK, I don't... You've lost me.

32:38.164 --> 32:40.332
Hold on a minute...

32:40.458 --> 32:42.376
Oh, fuck this.

32:42.502 --> 32:44.127
What?

32:51.344 --> 32:52.970
# La la la, la la la la, la la la.

32:53.096 --> 32:54.179
Good.

32:54.305 --> 32:56.974
Your military hardware
is impressive, General.

32:57.100 --> 32:59.142
Yeah, well, not any more, it isn't.

32:59.268 --> 33:02.020
So, you add these together.

33:04.524 --> 33:08.819
So this is the number of combat troops
available for an invasion,

33:08.945 --> 33:10.570
according to these figures.

33:11.739 --> 33:13.073
12!

33:13.199 --> 33:14.866
Thousand?

33:14.993 --> 33:16.868
No, 12. 12 troops.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.578
Oh, come on, you're shitting me?

33:18.705 --> 33:22.207
I am shitting you.
12,000 troops, 12,000 troops,

33:22.333 --> 33:26.253
but that's not enough...
that's the amount that are going to die.

33:26.379 --> 33:29.089
And at the end of a war
you need some soldiers left, really,

33:29.215 --> 33:31.008
or else it looks like you've lost.

33:32.176 --> 33:34.177
Bye, for now.

33:34.303 --> 33:37.097
You know what? I've got some Brits
I have to meet tomorrow.

33:37.223 --> 33:38.849
A guy named Simon Foster.

33:38.975 --> 33:40.684
Who's Simon Foster?

33:40.810 --> 33:44.271
He's this guy that said publicly
that war was unforeseeable.

33:44.397 --> 33:47.232
And I think he could be very useful
on the war committee.

33:47.358 --> 33:50.027
He can internationalise the dissent,
start to.

33:50.153 --> 33:53.196
You're going to use him
as a little meat puppet?

34:07.086 --> 34:09.045
Tobes... hi.

34:09.172 --> 34:11.047
Hi.

34:11.174 --> 34:14.009
What are we gonna... do tonight?

34:15.053 --> 34:16.887
Gonna do tonight?

34:17.013 --> 34:20.891
Yes, what are we up to, my...
my chief aide...?

34:21.016 --> 34:23.726
Well... yeah, I mean,
I sort of thought tonight

34:23.853 --> 34:26.730
we'd probably be just a bit tired, really.

34:26.856 --> 34:31.485
No, I am tired.
But I'm also a career politician, Toby,

34:31.610 --> 34:35.237
in the political powerhouse of the world
for 48 hours,

34:35.364 --> 34:39.659
and I thought it might be nice to go out
rather than just sitting in my room

34:39.786 --> 34:42.329
trying to spank one out
over a shark documentary,

34:42.455 --> 34:44.121
because I'm scared if I watch a porno

34:44.248 --> 34:47.626
it'll end up in
the register of members' interests. So...

34:49.087 --> 34:50.920
What have you got... for us to do?

34:51.047 --> 34:53.882
Right, what have I got?
Well, so far we've got...

34:55.259 --> 34:56.927
Well, there's a leaflet through the door

34:57.053 --> 35:00.472
for happy hour at the bar
which might be interesting.

35:01.474 --> 35:03.725
Also I do have the number of a guy

35:03.851 --> 35:07.604
I was at uni with
who works for CNN out here.

35:07.730 --> 35:09.773
- No.
- No?

35:12.276 --> 35:14.778
- Where are you?
- I'm waving at you.

35:14.904 --> 35:16.571
I don't see you, be more visible.

35:16.697 --> 35:20.450
I'm, like, practically on top of you, I'm
coming to you, is what I'm going to do.

35:20.576 --> 35:22.786
You can stop talking
on your cellphone now.

35:22.912 --> 35:24.621
Of course I can.

35:24.747 --> 35:27.374
Look, I have to leave.
Phone Simon Foster's guy.

35:27.500 --> 35:29.501
Tell them, come to the war committee.

35:29.627 --> 35:32.295
I'll give them some face time
tomorrow around ten o'clock.

35:32.421 --> 35:35.590
It'll be coffee and Danish.
Tea. They'll want tea.

35:35.716 --> 35:38.468
Tea and sympathy,
tea and a hand job, whatever.

35:39.846 --> 35:43.181
...great deal that is unknown
about hammerhead sharks,

35:43.307 --> 35:44.641
such as their mating habits.

35:44.767 --> 35:47.144
You can definitely spot
the female ones.

35:48.187 --> 35:49.396
Hello.

35:49.522 --> 35:52.691
Hi, Toby, what are you doing tonight?

35:52.817 --> 35:55.694
Well, no, it's unbelievably hectic.
Actually we're...

35:55.820 --> 35:57.821
Their courtship is a violent affair.

35:57.947 --> 36:01.366
The male will bite the female
until she acquiesces.

36:01.492 --> 36:04.369
The war committee, that's a big thing,
Liza.

36:04.495 --> 36:07.581
Yeah, well,
I have been on committees before,

36:07.707 --> 36:11.376
the Challenges For The Cheese
Market, that was one of the big ones.

36:11.502 --> 36:14.004
Yeah, God, yeah. Love a drink.

36:14.130 --> 36:16.423
40 minutes is perfect, yeah, yeah.

36:16.549 --> 36:19.009
Bye-bye. Bye. Bye. Bye, bye.

36:21.387 --> 36:23.388
- Matty, how's CNN?
- Great.

36:23.514 --> 36:25.223
I can't, mate, no.

36:25.349 --> 36:29.019
Liza Weld has got us onto the Future
Planning Committee in the morning.

36:29.145 --> 36:31.646
The "war committee"
to the likes of you and me.

36:31.772 --> 36:33.440
What are you talking about?

36:33.566 --> 36:36.902
The Future Planning Committee
is Linton's war committee.

36:37.028 --> 36:40.405
Do you not work for CNN
or is it the Cartoon News Network?

36:46.412 --> 36:48.914
Come in.
I just wasn't expecting to see you here.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.583
Physically here.
Obviously you're always in my heart.

36:51.709 --> 36:54.794
I'm here, I'm there, I'm fucking
everywhere, I'm the egg man.

36:54.921 --> 36:57.255
Have you come to insult me
in a different time zone?

36:57.381 --> 37:01.092
Yeah. No, sorry, I'm just off out
for a drink with her just now.

37:01.219 --> 37:04.262
No. You're barking up
the wrong cock there, my friend.

37:04.388 --> 37:07.140
Little Toby is staying very much
in his hammock this evening.

37:07.266 --> 37:09.267
- Simon, I've got us on the...
- Hiya.

37:09.393 --> 37:11.436
Jesus Christ, fucking hell, Malcolm.

37:11.562 --> 37:14.064
You're supposed to shit yourself
in there, not out here.

37:14.190 --> 37:18.610
I've got us on Linton's Future Planning
Committee for tomorrow morning.

37:18.736 --> 37:21.029
Brilliant. What is that?

37:21.155 --> 37:23.031
It's the war committee.

37:23.157 --> 37:25.951
What? The actual war...
the actual war committee?

37:26.077 --> 37:29.621
- Who's going to be there?
- Karen Clark, Liza Weld,

37:29.747 --> 37:31.623
me and Simon...

37:31.749 --> 37:33.625
Simon and me.

37:33.751 --> 37:36.461
How about the rest of the committee,
who are they going to be?

37:36.587 --> 37:38.964
Jimmy Osmond, Gwyneth Paltrow?
It's a diversion.

37:39.090 --> 37:41.758
The real committee,
that's happening at the White House.

37:41.884 --> 37:44.302
I'll text you the details,
because I'm going to go out

37:44.428 --> 37:46.972
for a drink with
some State Department bods just now.

37:47.098 --> 37:50.183
Don't mention this to the press, OK?
Don't mention it to anyone.

37:50.309 --> 37:53.144
If the press get a whiff
that there's a war committee

37:53.271 --> 37:55.480
even a cardboard one,
every fucker in this town

37:55.606 --> 37:57.482
is gonna turn up and try and get on it.

37:57.608 --> 38:00.485
So no matter what gay bar
you end up in, keep it shtoom.

38:02.655 --> 38:04.489
I was watching that.

38:04.615 --> 38:06.866
Yeah, well,
I have to have a word with you.

38:06.993 --> 38:09.327
You might want
to slip into your negligee.

38:15.668 --> 38:17.836
- You see this mosh pit?
- Yeah.

38:17.962 --> 38:21.506
Well, they're mostly house staffers,
senators' interns.

38:21.632 --> 38:24.968
Tonight they rage hard,
but tomorrow they go back to the Hill

38:25.094 --> 38:28.179
and argue noise-reduction legislation.

38:30.516 --> 38:33.393
- Is this yours or mine?
- I don't know, I've got three.

38:33.519 --> 38:35.520
So one of these has got to be yours.

38:35.646 --> 38:38.898
Those are like fluids that I've never...
would you call wax a fluid?

38:39.025 --> 38:41.026
No, it's not a fluid, it's more of a...

38:41.152 --> 38:43.987
- It's very intimate.
- It's an ooze... it's an ooze.

38:44.113 --> 38:46.156
Ooo... eugh!

38:51.996 --> 38:54.748
Karen will want you to say
"War is unforeseeable. "

38:54.874 --> 38:58.710
And Linton will want you to talk up the
"climbing the mountain of conflict" line.

38:58.836 --> 39:00.754
You say nothing, OK?

39:00.880 --> 39:04.591
You stay detached, otherwise
that's what I will do to your retinas.

39:04.717 --> 39:06.634
Right. Can I go to bed now, please?

39:06.761 --> 39:08.803
No, no, no, no.
We're going to stay here

39:08.929 --> 39:11.431
and you are going to rehearse
saying nothing.

39:12.433 --> 39:14.392
Am I being tortured?

39:15.728 --> 39:17.437
You look worried.

39:17.563 --> 39:20.815
It's the paper that I wrote for Karen.

39:20.941 --> 39:23.943
It's called PWIP PIP, it's about war.

39:24.070 --> 39:27.280
The pros and cons,
and I came up with too many cons.

39:27.406 --> 39:29.991
I'm, like, fucking worried because...

39:30.117 --> 39:33.411
this is, like, my career on the line.

39:34.413 --> 39:37.791
I thought you were worried,
because you were looking worried.

39:37.917 --> 39:42.003
But you know, don't...
I mean, don't... don't worry.

39:44.006 --> 39:45.882
- Thank you.
- OK.

39:46.008 --> 39:48.051
- Sure.
- Thank you.

39:49.595 --> 39:51.596
God damn it!

39:53.265 --> 39:56.309
Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm just taking off my shoes.

39:56.435 --> 39:58.395
Why is that? Is it a mosque?

39:58.521 --> 40:00.438
It's just, like...

40:00.564 --> 40:02.440
Is it... Is it a bouncy castle?

40:10.908 --> 40:13.076
Can I just say,
what happens in Washington,

40:13.202 --> 40:15.245
stays in Washington, yeah?

40:16.247 --> 40:20.667
Well, I live in Washington, so that
doesn't, like, really work for me.

40:21.419 --> 40:22.794
Yeah?

40:38.894 --> 40:41.813
A number for a cab company
in Washington DC, please.

40:43.315 --> 40:46.651
Just straight through, straight through.
Hi, I need a cab.

40:47.820 --> 40:53.450
Well, I don't know.
I'm outside number 1427, moving on...

40:53.576 --> 40:56.161
I don't know,
it's a nice street, it's quite leafy,

40:56.287 --> 40:58.329
federal houses.

41:04.128 --> 41:05.753
Marcel's is nice.

41:05.880 --> 41:07.547
I like their wraps.

41:07.673 --> 41:11.134
And you should go to La Taverna,
the Greek place, that's fantastic.

41:11.260 --> 41:13.386
They do that thing
where they set fire to the cheese.

41:13.512 --> 41:15.263
What's that called? It's a lot of fun.

41:15.389 --> 41:17.682
Yes, it sounds fun.

41:21.103 --> 41:25.773
And, well, there's the Aerospace
Museum and the National Gallery.

41:25.900 --> 41:27.942
Do they set fire to the pictures?

41:29.528 --> 41:31.529
Yeah.

41:33.741 --> 41:39.537
Hi, sorry I'm so late for the meeting.
One or two issues getting here, but...

41:39.663 --> 41:41.706
- I'm Karen.
- Hi. Toby.

41:41.832 --> 41:43.374
Pull an all-nighter?

41:45.252 --> 41:49.088
- Well, I... I was led astray.
- Oh. By who?

41:50.299 --> 41:54.594
I... I just ran into some people
from the MoD and...

41:54.720 --> 41:56.554
Not Penny Grayling?

41:56.680 --> 41:58.389
No.

41:58.516 --> 42:01.392
Another... gang.

42:01.519 --> 42:04.395
Wow, I didn't realise we had
so many delegations in town.

42:04.522 --> 42:07.357
No, well... "The British are coming!"

42:13.239 --> 42:14.906
So...

42:15.032 --> 42:18.618
Yeah, you know what? I have a lot
of things to check on just now.

42:18.744 --> 42:22.247
So this would probably be
a good place to break things up.

42:22.373 --> 42:23.581
No problem.

42:23.707 --> 42:24.832
Brilliant.

42:24.959 --> 42:26.584
Bye.

42:29.755 --> 42:31.923
I've brought your bag for you.

42:32.758 --> 42:34.133
Cheers, man.

42:34.260 --> 42:37.262
Tobes, I don't want to have to
read you the riot act here,

42:37.388 --> 42:40.932
but I am going to have to read you
some extracts from the riot act.

42:41.058 --> 42:46.020
Like section one, paragraph one: Don't
leave your boss twisting in the wind,

42:46.146 --> 42:50.942
and then burst in late
smelling like a pissed seaside donkey.

42:51.944 --> 42:54.487
"The British are coming. "

42:54.613 --> 42:57.282
All right, I was late for the meeting.
I am sorry,

42:57.408 --> 42:59.993
but it's not like I threw up in there, is it?

43:00.119 --> 43:02.161
No, you're right, I'm being unfair.

43:02.788 --> 43:05.790
I should be thanking you
for not throwing up.

43:05.916 --> 43:09.502
Well done, you're a star.
You didn't wet yourself, did you?

43:09.628 --> 43:13.381
You're in the right city.
You didn't say anything overtly racist.

43:13.507 --> 43:16.301
You didn't pull your dick out
and start plucking it

43:16.427 --> 43:18.845
and shouting, "Willy banjo. "

43:18.971 --> 43:21.180
No, I'm being really unfair.

43:21.307 --> 43:25.310
You'd got so much right
without actually being there

43:25.436 --> 43:29.147
for the beginning of one of the
most important moments of my career.

43:30.149 --> 43:33.026
Thanks, you're a legend.

43:39.491 --> 43:43.244
That was just the beginning, do you
think? Are we going back in there?

43:43.370 --> 43:44.996
I don't know, we barely said hello.

43:45.122 --> 43:46.914
I've had muggings
that lasted longer.

43:47.041 --> 43:49.334
All we talked about
was flammable cheese.

43:49.460 --> 43:53.671
What if our meeting has
finished? What if Karen comes back,

43:53.797 --> 43:55.715
and then we're still sitting here?

43:55.841 --> 43:59.844
It's going to be embarrassing, isn't it?
We're going to look like groupies.

43:59.970 --> 44:01.638
What if the meeting hasn't finished?

44:01.764 --> 44:03.681
And she comes back
and we've disappeared?

44:03.807 --> 44:05.642
Maybe I could call Judy? She could...

44:05.768 --> 44:09.354
Please can we try
and just do one thing without Judy?

44:09.480 --> 44:10.355
Fine.

44:10.481 --> 44:17.528
I think we've drawn long enough
from that... teat.

44:19.615 --> 44:23.576
Surprisingly enough, a lot of the marble
in the building is not imported.

44:23.702 --> 44:25.703
- Really?
- It's really interesting...

44:25.829 --> 44:28.581
- If you study the stonework...
- Not at the moment.

44:28.707 --> 44:30.667
So, you made it in OK, right?

44:30.793 --> 44:33.294
Yeah, hunky-dory, thanks.
Can I get a coffee?

44:33.420 --> 44:35.171
Sure, sure.

44:35.297 --> 44:39.342
If we just get started, my assistant
should be bringing in coffee shortly.

44:40.386 --> 44:42.261
Your assistant?

44:42.388 --> 44:44.889
Yeah. So, item.

44:45.015 --> 44:48.393
We need to have a conversation about
the mood of the British Parliament,

44:48.519 --> 44:50.978
the bumps in the road ahead
and what not.

44:51.105 --> 44:55.733
I'm sorry, I don't...
This situation here is... is this it?

44:55.859 --> 44:58.152
No offence, son,
but you look like you should still be

44:58.278 --> 45:00.530
at school with your head down
a fucking toilet.

45:00.656 --> 45:04.409
Your first point there, the offence?
I'm afraid I'm going to have to take it.

45:04.535 --> 45:08.287
Your second point, I'm 22, but item,
it's my birthday in nine days, so...

45:08.414 --> 45:11.207
if it will make you feel more
comfortable, we could wait.

45:11.333 --> 45:13.251
Don't get sarcastic with me, son.

45:13.377 --> 45:16.379
We burned this tight-arsed city
to the ground in 1814.

45:16.505 --> 45:20.633
And I'm all for doing it again,
starting with you, you frat fuck.

45:20.759 --> 45:22.593
You get sarcastic with me again

45:22.720 --> 45:25.513
and I will stuff so much cotton wool
down your fucking throat

45:25.639 --> 45:28.307
it'll come out your arse
like the tail on a Playboy bunny.

45:28.434 --> 45:32.228
I was led to believe
I was attending the war committee.

45:32.354 --> 45:35.732
Yes, Assistant Secretary of State
Linton Barwick asked me to brief you

45:35.858 --> 45:38.276
on the work of
the Future Planning Committee.

45:38.402 --> 45:40.319
I'm away.

45:40.446 --> 45:42.780
And here we are.
The fucking Vice President

45:42.906 --> 45:44.949
has also graced us with his presence.

45:45.075 --> 45:47.118
Give him a bottle of milk.

45:47.244 --> 45:49.120
You didn't wake me up.

45:49.246 --> 45:52.415
The thought crossed my mind,
but you just looked so sweet there.

45:52.541 --> 45:54.417
You know, with the jet lag and all.

45:54.543 --> 45:57.044
I don't know, I thought
you knew what you were doing.

45:57.171 --> 46:00.131
Well, no. Obviously I didn't know
what I was doing, I was asleep.

46:00.257 --> 46:03.176
That's how people walk through
windows, that's how that happens.

46:03.302 --> 46:05.344
Hey, Liza? I've got another call

46:05.471 --> 46:08.598
for you about the committee
from Senator Crudden's office.

46:08.724 --> 46:10.767
Crudden? What is going on?

46:10.893 --> 46:13.144
I mean, how did CNN
know about the committee?

46:13.270 --> 46:17.064
Did Linton post, like,
an invite on Facebook or something?

46:17.191 --> 46:20.818
Liza? Everyone is so hot for this paper,
I just wanted to let you know.

46:20.944 --> 46:22.820
I'm about to run off another ten copies.

46:22.946 --> 46:25.865
- Just stop.
- It's like a Harry Potter book,

46:25.991 --> 46:28.826
if Harry Potter
made people really, really angry.

46:28.952 --> 46:31.579
You're in hot water,
you're lobsterising.

46:31.705 --> 46:34.373
Do you smell lobster?
Because I smell lobster.

46:34.500 --> 46:37.710
Strong... bisque wafting this way.

46:37.836 --> 46:39.796
How far would you go with Linton?

46:39.922 --> 46:41.839
You freaky little stalker.

46:41.965 --> 46:45.176
Downtown?
Or all the way up Brokeback Mountain?

46:45.302 --> 46:47.845
Smells like bisque. Smells like bisque.

46:55.813 --> 46:58.439
Where's the war committee?
I thought I was going.

46:58.565 --> 47:01.526
Simon's going. I thought
you were doing your one-to-one?

47:01.652 --> 47:03.194
Where the fuck is it happening?

47:03.320 --> 47:06.072
It's in the State Department
on the seventh floor.

47:06.198 --> 47:08.032
- Malcolm?
- What?

47:08.158 --> 47:11.828
Do you like how I'm telling you
what's going on where you are?

47:11.954 --> 47:14.539
Let me tell you what's going on
where you are, sweetheart.

47:14.665 --> 47:17.416
A certain vinegar-faced,
manipulative cowbag is about

47:17.543 --> 47:19.377
to discover that she's out of a fucking...

47:19.503 --> 47:23.506
job. Fucking hung up, haven't you?
You fucking hoity-toity fucking...

47:23.632 --> 47:26.050
Hey, buddy?
Enough with the curse words, all right?

47:26.176 --> 47:29.011
Kiss my sweaty balls, you fat fuck.

47:31.682 --> 47:34.350
- There's the grenade.
- I know, I'm looking at it.

47:34.476 --> 47:37.937
He's got "Climb the mountain
of conflict" on his picture.

47:38.063 --> 47:40.106
He's picked up on that?

47:41.108 --> 47:43.234
I'm a bumper sticker.

47:43.360 --> 47:45.319
Shit, there's Karen Clark.

47:45.445 --> 47:47.238
Have a meeting, have a meeting.

47:51.076 --> 47:54.704
What about the dialectic, as it spreads
across the different territories?

47:54.830 --> 47:56.873
- Interesting dialectic...
- Oh, hi.

47:56.999 --> 47:59.375
Hi. I'll see you at the committee.

47:59.501 --> 48:01.669
We're just sorting out a bit of prep...

48:01.795 --> 48:04.088
Very good, that's great.

48:04.214 --> 48:07.383
- Liza. They're still here.
- I know. I told them where it was.

48:07.509 --> 48:09.093
OK, let's go, let's go. Come on.

48:09.219 --> 48:12.263
Quick, we've got to keep up
with them, now. Let's roll.

48:12.389 --> 48:15.391
No, you can't say "let's roll",
they don't like it here.

48:15.517 --> 48:19.395
That's just who asked to be in
on the committee, it's crazy.

48:19.521 --> 48:22.106
- Yeah.
- Hello.

48:22.232 --> 48:25.276
Are you joining us
or shall we see you there?

48:25.402 --> 48:27.194
Oh, I'm so sorry. No, see you there.

48:27.321 --> 48:30.114
I don't need to do any of the things

48:30.240 --> 48:33.117
that you need to go in there to do,
so I'll just see you there.

48:33.243 --> 48:35.286
- Toby, do you need to use the...?
- No, no, no.

48:35.412 --> 48:38.456
- I don't need the restroom.
- All right, OK.

48:39.499 --> 48:41.417
Yeah, they're insane.

48:41.543 --> 48:43.461
Where is it?

48:43.587 --> 48:45.504
I don't know. We can wait here.

48:45.631 --> 48:49.133
Wait round here. When they come out,
we'll follow them again.

48:57.142 --> 48:58.976
Plenty of room down the back.

48:59.102 --> 49:03.773
We seem to be
overrun with insurgents, Bob, huh?

49:03.899 --> 49:06.442
There must have been a leak.
- Really, no kidding?

49:06.568 --> 49:10.571
- Unbelievable!
- Is this the wrestling? Is that the ring?

49:10.697 --> 49:12.156
There's General Miller.

49:12.282 --> 49:16.661
I think it's best that we move,
reconvene to a bigger, a larger venue.

49:16.787 --> 49:19.163
- If you follow my lead...
- Take an agenda.

49:19.289 --> 49:21.832
Please take an agenda,
we want to stick to that.

49:21.959 --> 49:26.003
This is a cluster fuck.
How did CNN know about this?

49:26.129 --> 49:29.340
- Hold onto that one!
- Could you get Miller to sign it?

49:29.466 --> 49:32.551
If we could do this
with a certain amount of energy.

49:32.678 --> 49:34.595
Just this way, folks.

49:34.721 --> 49:36.764
Moo!

49:43.021 --> 49:45.189
Find a chair,
wherever you're comfortable.

49:45.315 --> 49:46.774
More this way.

49:46.900 --> 49:49.402
Excellent. I'm room meat again.

49:49.528 --> 49:53.406
This is a massive abattoir
of room meat.

49:54.658 --> 49:57.201
Just so you know,
Karen and I did not appreciate

49:57.327 --> 49:59.578
having to skulk around
like Mulder and Scully

49:59.705 --> 50:01.372
to find out about the committee.

50:01.498 --> 50:04.709
Well, you're both here now, huh,
John and Yoko?

50:04.835 --> 50:06.460
We need to talk.

50:06.586 --> 50:09.463
How about my office,
12:30 tomorrow, huh?

50:09.589 --> 50:11.048
OK, off you go.

50:11.174 --> 50:13.551
- What do you mean?
- I've got this covered.

50:13.677 --> 50:17.221
Go and find the next thing. Talk to that
Chad boy, the boy from The Shining.

50:17.347 --> 50:18.723
He knows things.

50:18.849 --> 50:21.892
- Don't make me pump Chad.
- No, I'm making you pump Chad.

50:22.019 --> 50:24.478
Go on, it'll be easy-peasey
lemon-squeezy.

50:24.604 --> 50:29.316
No, it won't. It'll be difficult, difficult,
lemon difficult, that is what it'll be.

50:29.443 --> 50:31.736
Have a lovely afternoon.
Stop a war for me.

50:31.862 --> 50:35.823
So, welcome
to the somewhat engorged

50:35.949 --> 50:39.076
session of
the Future Planning Committee.

50:39.202 --> 50:41.912
Yes, Assistant Secretary, on point six,

50:42.039 --> 50:45.750
it feels like there's already been
an assumption that we're invading

50:45.876 --> 50:50.713
and don't you think that we should
discuss the practical implications?

50:50.839 --> 50:53.632
I mean, this is,
after all, the war committee.

50:53.759 --> 50:56.260
This is the Future Planning Committee.

50:56.386 --> 50:59.430
Well, unofficially,
it is called the war committee.

50:59.556 --> 51:03.059
Well, Karen, unofficially,
we can call anything whatever we want.

51:03.185 --> 51:07.938
I mean, unofficially, this is a shoe, but
it's not, Karen, it is a glass of water.

51:08.065 --> 51:11.275
And this is
the Future Planning Committee.

51:11.401 --> 51:14.278
Well, unofficially,
this appears to be bullshit.

51:16.281 --> 51:18.532
Hey.

51:18.658 --> 51:20.951
- What's all this?
- "Climb the mountain of conflict!"

51:21.078 --> 51:23.788
We're just choosing a font
for what looks appropriate.

51:23.914 --> 51:25.748
What about that font the SS used?

51:25.874 --> 51:27.917
Have you thought about
using that one?

51:28.043 --> 51:30.294
Er... well,
that obviously has bad connotations.

51:30.420 --> 51:32.296
Heavy metal?

51:32.422 --> 51:34.298
- No, the SS.
- Oh, right.

51:37.969 --> 51:44.141
Has a decision already been made,
in principle, to advocate invasion?

51:44.267 --> 51:46.519
I would refer you
to the recent comments

51:46.645 --> 51:51.565
of our colleague from the UK,
Mr Simon Foster, in that regard.

51:51.691 --> 51:56.320
Yes, I think that Mr Foster
would have something to say to that.

51:56.947 --> 51:59.740
I'm... I'm certainly hearing both sides.

52:01.159 --> 52:05.830
In England we have a saying
for a situation such as this,

52:06.873 --> 52:10.501
which is that it's difficult, difficult...

52:12.003 --> 52:14.004
...lemon difficult.

52:16.967 --> 52:21.137
You betcha. Huh?
I do think a consensus is forming.

52:21.263 --> 52:24.807
No, No, it's not,
and you have no basis for saying that.

52:24.933 --> 52:26.642
Karen, calm down.

52:26.768 --> 52:29.728
Because we don't want you
to have another haemorrhage.

52:33.525 --> 52:35.526
Linton! Linton!

52:36.528 --> 52:39.405
Mr Tucker, isn't it?
Nice to see you again.

52:39.531 --> 52:41.574
Are you fucking me about?

52:43.869 --> 52:45.744
Is there a problem, Mr Tucker?

52:45.871 --> 52:49.081
I've just come from a briefing
with a nine-year-old child.

52:49.207 --> 52:51.959
You're talking about AJ.
AJ is one of our top guys.

52:52.085 --> 52:54.962
He's a Stanton College Prep, Harvard.

52:55.088 --> 52:56.797
One of the brightest and best.

52:56.923 --> 52:59.884
Well, his briefing notes
were written in alphabetti spaghetti.

53:00.010 --> 53:02.970
When I left, I nearly tripped up
over his fucking umbilical cord.

53:03.096 --> 53:05.181
I'm sorry it troubles you
that our people

53:05.307 --> 53:07.558
achieve excellence
at such an early age.

53:07.684 --> 53:10.853
But could we just move on
to what's important here?

53:10.979 --> 53:14.231
Now, I understand that
your Prime Minister has asked you

53:14.357 --> 53:20.237
to supply us with some, say,
fresh British intelligence, is that true?

53:20.363 --> 53:23.741
Yeah, apparently, your fucking
master race of highly-gifted toddlers

53:23.867 --> 53:26.202
- can't quite get the job done...
- All right.

53:26.328 --> 53:29.038
...between breast feeds
and playing with their Power Rangers.

53:29.164 --> 53:31.999
So, an actual grown-up
has been asked to fucking bail you out.

53:32.125 --> 53:35.836
Ah, Minister. Thank you so much
for your support, we appreciate it.

53:35.962 --> 53:39.256
And what did you say,
that "Climb the mountain of conflict"?

53:39.382 --> 53:43.135
- Right, that's terrific.
- It's quite complicated in terms of my...

53:43.261 --> 53:46.430
It's early days, my friend.
All roads lead to Munich.

53:46.556 --> 53:49.266
"All roads lead to Munich"?
What the fuck does that mean?

53:49.392 --> 53:52.603
I think it just means...
Actually, I don't know what it means.

53:54.397 --> 53:57.274
You see that?
Pull that out, America deflates.

53:57.400 --> 54:01.153
Yeah, very easy to mock. The closest
you'll come to getting one of those

54:01.279 --> 54:03.239
is buying a fucking Toblerone.

54:03.365 --> 54:05.950
I'll meet you in the car.
Come on, back to London.

54:06.076 --> 54:07.993
So, what are we going back to

54:08.119 --> 54:10.955
apart from a nice cup of tea
and some knife crime?

54:11.081 --> 54:13.958
Constituency surgery in Northampton.

54:14.084 --> 54:16.085
Oh, great.

54:16.211 --> 54:18.128
Meeting my constituents.

54:18.255 --> 54:22.216
It's like being Simon Cowell
but without the ability to say,

54:22.342 --> 54:24.718
"Fuck off you're mental. "

54:33.645 --> 54:35.521
It's stuck.

54:35.647 --> 54:37.940
Simon, do you mind?

54:38.066 --> 54:41.652
If you just kick it at the bottom
really hard, that should do it.

54:43.571 --> 54:46.573
I'm just going to go
and deal with that guttering.

54:46.700 --> 54:48.742
We've just come back from America,
Roz.

54:48.868 --> 54:51.996
Right. How was the President?

54:52.122 --> 54:53.539
Good, actually. Yeah.

54:54.582 --> 54:55.916
Good.

54:58.128 --> 55:02.006
Oh, dear, how the mighty have fallen.
From White House to shitehouse.

55:03.008 --> 55:06.593
Actually, mate, sorry, fuck this,
could you get under there?

55:08.221 --> 55:10.222
- Is that any better?
- No.

55:11.683 --> 55:15.602
This septic tank, if we didn't even know
it was there in the first place,

55:15.729 --> 55:18.063
how come we're responsible for it now?

55:18.189 --> 55:20.149
I think what's causing the problem

55:20.275 --> 55:23.235
is that it's not actually
a council septic tank.

55:23.361 --> 55:26.613
- You should leave this to us now.
- Really?

55:26.740 --> 55:29.450
Certainly, I'm completely on board.

55:29.576 --> 55:31.410
- Is he?
- Thanks for coming in.

55:31.536 --> 55:33.537
- All right?
- Right, yes, thank you.

55:33.663 --> 55:35.581
- Thank you.
- Thanks very much.

55:35.707 --> 55:37.166
Thanks.

55:37.292 --> 55:38.792
- Hello.
- Hello.

55:38.918 --> 55:40.836
- Mr Foster.
- Call me Simon.

55:40.962 --> 55:42.838
- Right, OK.
- You've met Roz.

55:42.964 --> 55:44.465
- I know I have.
- Lovely.

55:44.591 --> 55:47.468
I'll keep it brief, I know you're
a busy man. There's a fellow there

55:47.594 --> 55:51.221
who wants to stop people talking
in foreign languages in shops.

55:52.223 --> 55:54.391
Yeah. Well, this sometimes
can be a magnet

55:54.517 --> 55:57.436
for people who are
slightly mentally dispossessed.

56:00.023 --> 56:03.275
And also very sensible people,
like yourself, Paul.

56:03.401 --> 56:06.653
- Paul, why don't you just...
- Don't you fucking patronise me, mate.

56:06.780 --> 56:11.492
Paul, why don't you
just outline the whole issue?

56:11.618 --> 56:13.494
Right, OK, I'll tell you again.

56:13.620 --> 56:17.498
Your constituency side wall...

56:17.624 --> 56:20.084
- Uh-huh.
... is falling down.

56:20.210 --> 56:24.671
Your wall... is falling
into my mother's garden.

56:24.798 --> 56:27.674
She tried to call the office,
but she was fobbed off.

56:27.801 --> 56:31.053
Fobbed off by your people, because
she's not Lord Snooty in a posh car

56:31.179 --> 56:33.097
or Madonna on a horse.

56:33.223 --> 56:36.642
Well, that I... I find that sort of thing
incredibly irritating myself.

56:36.768 --> 56:40.938
It's a patch from London,
it's Karen Clark. Urgent.

56:41.064 --> 56:44.066
- Hello? Sorry, I'm not here.
- Sorry, Paul.

56:44.192 --> 56:46.527
- I have to take this.
- Am I being fobbed off?

56:46.653 --> 56:47.694
Absolutely not.

56:47.821 --> 56:50.864
What's the difference between
being fobbed off and what happened?

56:50.990 --> 56:53.033
You won't be able to forget me, Simon.

56:53.159 --> 56:54.660
What's going on there, Simon?

56:54.786 --> 56:57.913
It's... It's departmental business.
It's about a wall.

56:58.039 --> 57:00.082
- Oh, Gaza?
- Uh-huh.

57:00.208 --> 57:02.709
I'm wondering where you were
in committee, Simon.

57:02.836 --> 57:06.255
I called for back-up and you sat there
like a dumb sack of shit.

57:06.381 --> 57:09.550
Only maybe worse,
because, actually, on a molecular level,

57:09.676 --> 57:11.927
shit is probably fizzling with energy.

57:12.053 --> 57:14.721
I have to say, Karen, I do have
a clear strategy on this,

57:14.848 --> 57:17.099
which is I'm playing...
playing the long game.

57:17.225 --> 57:18.725
Still here, Simon.

57:18.852 --> 57:22.271
They've bounced us into a short game,
and you just sat there like a...

57:22.397 --> 57:25.149
What do you call it in England?
A wanker.

57:25.275 --> 57:27.192
No, we don't call it that.

57:27.318 --> 57:29.069
Paul. Paul.

57:29.195 --> 57:32.114
Perhaps if I had a bomb strapped
to my chest, I'd get more attention.

57:32.240 --> 57:34.324
He's mentioned the matter of a bomb.

57:34.451 --> 57:37.744
I'm not going to let a bomb off,
I work for the National Trust.

57:37.871 --> 57:40.205
How do I know
you're not going to let a bomb off?

57:40.331 --> 57:45.419
Listen, Paul, why don't I give
you, the details of my cell

57:45.545 --> 57:48.172
- so that you...
- Mobile phone details.

57:48.298 --> 57:51.008
- Mobile phone details.
- Have you got a mobile, Paul?

57:51.134 --> 57:53.218
- Of course I've got a fucking mobile!
- Roz.

57:53.344 --> 57:54.595
What is wrong with you?

57:54.721 --> 57:56.430
Five megapixels.

57:56.556 --> 57:58.474
Can we see the wall?
Would that satisfy you?

57:58.600 --> 58:01.602
- Well, it's a start.
- Friends again? Let's go and do it.

58:01.728 --> 58:04.771
I'm not... not your friend,
and I'm not your friend.

58:04.898 --> 58:06.773
Thank you.

58:06.900 --> 58:08.484
That's a pleasure.

58:08.610 --> 58:10.652
Thank you.

58:11.696 --> 58:13.363
Done. I'm done, I'm done.

58:13.490 --> 58:15.991
- Thank you.
- Let's go have a good look at that wall.

58:16.117 --> 58:19.453
Four more constituents. How many
do you think are going to be like that?

58:19.579 --> 58:21.330
OK, hang on.

58:21.456 --> 58:26.043
Also the committee got leaked and
that leak came from your department.

58:26.169 --> 58:30.339
I want a head on a plate, to go.

58:31.341 --> 58:34.801
You're not my boss. Er... fuck off!

58:35.637 --> 58:37.804
You can't make me sack people.

58:37.931 --> 58:39.806
Why does she want someone sacked?

58:39.933 --> 58:41.975
Ah, she said there's a leak...

58:42.810 --> 58:46.355
The detail of the committee meeting
in America was made public.

58:46.481 --> 58:49.066
There shouldn't have been
as many people there.

58:49.192 --> 58:51.818
Right, and who does she want sacked?

58:51.945 --> 58:54.821
- Somebody from our office.
- Right.

58:54.948 --> 58:57.115
Let's forget it. Come on, next person.

58:58.117 --> 59:00.994
- Could it have been Judy?
- Probably.

59:03.540 --> 59:06.166
Judy, can you come
into my office, I need a word?

59:06.292 --> 59:08.210
One second. Tobes, that's for you.

59:08.336 --> 59:10.003
What is it?

59:10.129 --> 59:12.506
- It's that madman about the wall.
- The war?

59:12.632 --> 59:15.050
Wall! Eugh.

59:15.176 --> 59:18.428
Will you please come into my office
so I can give you a bollocking?

59:18.555 --> 59:20.764
Yeah, OK, OK, what?
- Hello.

59:20.890 --> 59:22.683
- Argh! Fucker!
- I want a word with you.

59:22.809 --> 59:24.685
And you, Charlotte fucking BrontÃ«.

59:24.811 --> 59:26.687
What can I do for you, Paul?

59:26.813 --> 59:31.858
You know those buttresses
that you had put up for the wall?

59:31.985 --> 59:33.777
They are utterly insubstantial

59:33.903 --> 59:36.697
to even the untrained eye,
and I'm looking at them.

59:36.823 --> 59:38.824
And my eye's trained.

59:38.950 --> 59:41.785
No, I get that, I do... I understand that.

59:41.911 --> 59:44.580
If that wall collapsed
and my mother was in the greenhouse,

59:44.706 --> 59:46.290
that could crush her to death.

59:46.416 --> 59:49.459
Do you know how old she is?
Tell the reporter how old you are.

59:49.586 --> 59:50.836
I'm 60.

59:50.962 --> 59:52.879
She's 60... You're not fucking 60!

59:53.006 --> 59:56.466
If it's going in the newspaper, I'm 60.

59:56.593 --> 59:59.886
Olivia Newton-John's 60 and she's not
on the fucking statins, is she?

01:00:00.013 --> 01:00:03.056
- I didn't leak anything.
- Don't you fucking walk out on me.

01:00:03.182 --> 01:00:05.684
- I'm just getting my tea.
Let her get a cup of tea.

01:00:05.810 --> 01:00:09.563
Could you just get your mum to stay
away from the wall for the time being?

01:00:09.689 --> 01:00:11.898
She can't stay away,
she's got to water her plants.

01:00:12.025 --> 01:00:15.902
Could she maybe do it with a hose,
from a distance?

01:00:16.029 --> 01:00:18.155
She's got a watering can!

01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:19.656
Calm down, Paul, calm down.

01:00:19.782 --> 01:00:22.826
I'm not... I'm fucking Zen.

01:00:25.204 --> 01:00:27.372
I've brought my nunchucks
if you need them, sir.

01:00:27.498 --> 01:00:29.333
See how the meeting goes.

01:00:31.502 --> 01:00:33.503
12:30.

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:35.672
Hold on. General?

01:00:36.841 --> 01:00:41.345
Yeah... Secretary Linton Barwick
asked me to let you know

01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:44.640
that his last meeting
looks like it's overrunning,

01:00:44.766 --> 01:00:46.183
He sends his apologies.

01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:47.684
When will he be here?

01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:50.312
I don't have that information
at this moment.

01:00:50.438 --> 01:00:52.147
What the fuck?

01:00:52.273 --> 01:00:53.940
Huh?

01:00:54.067 --> 01:00:56.943
- Did he stand me up?
- No, no, sir.

01:00:57.070 --> 01:01:00.280
- You're more than welcome to wait.
- Do you know what I'm going to do?

01:01:00.406 --> 01:01:02.783
I'm going to take
a nice big shit on his desk,

01:01:02.909 --> 01:01:05.744
just to let him know that I was here.
Is that OK with you?

01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:08.246
I don't think he'd like that too much, sir.

01:01:10.249 --> 01:01:14.127
You can wait. We have
some very interesting periodicals.

01:01:14.253 --> 01:01:17.464
- There's um...
- Oh, yeah.

01:01:26.474 --> 01:01:30.352
You want me to read a periodical
at this time of national crisis? Huh?

01:01:30.478 --> 01:01:32.979
Sit here with my thumb up my ass
reading a paper?

01:01:33.106 --> 01:01:36.775
Finding out what? Which little starlet
fucked some guy this week?

01:01:36.901 --> 01:01:39.986
No, I wasn't suggesting that, sir.

01:01:42.699 --> 01:01:44.491
Give this to your boss.

01:01:46.411 --> 01:01:47.536
Yeah.

01:01:50.081 --> 01:01:52.082
Get out of my way.

01:02:09.892 --> 01:02:13.019
Oh, my God. What's up?

01:02:13.146 --> 01:02:15.147
Fucking Linton stood me up.

01:02:15.273 --> 01:02:18.191
He's playing me
like a turkey stick on a bass drum.

01:02:18.317 --> 01:02:20.736
Do you know where he is?
He's playing squash.

01:02:20.862 --> 01:02:23.613
With this little fucking twit?

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:26.575
No, not with... No, that's Chad.

01:02:26.701 --> 01:02:30.954
He just carries that every day,
because he's hoping to play squash.

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:34.666
I was going to eat lunch in here. Can
you digest? Do you want some food?

01:02:34.792 --> 01:02:36.501
Oh, yes, I can digest, yes.

01:02:36.627 --> 01:02:38.044
Chinese OK?

01:02:38.171 --> 01:02:40.630
Why don't you order me
some little mammals?

01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:43.592
A little bunny and a little puppy,
and a little cat,

01:02:43.718 --> 01:02:46.887
so I can twist their fucking neck off
and drink their blood.

01:02:47.013 --> 01:02:48.764
My, my. All right.

01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:52.434
While Foster jets around
at the taxpayers' expense,

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:55.896
his constituency wall is collapsing
and he doesn't give a shit.

01:02:56.022 --> 01:02:57.606
It doesn't say that?

01:02:57.732 --> 01:02:59.816
No. But it does say
"Wall-ace And Gromit".

01:02:59.942 --> 01:03:02.194
Wall-ace, though.

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:05.447
You're being portrayed as
the biggest twat in Northamptonshire.

01:03:05.573 --> 01:03:07.532
I've got bigger fish to fry, believe me.

01:03:07.658 --> 01:03:10.827
I'm giving this to somebody else.
Jamie!

01:03:10.953 --> 01:03:13.246
Ah, the crossest man in Scotland.

01:03:14.707 --> 01:03:16.625
Well, if it isn't Humpty Numpty.

01:03:16.751 --> 01:03:18.627
What is this? Surround bollocking?

01:03:18.753 --> 01:03:20.921
Hey, with due respect, I hadn't finished.

01:03:21.047 --> 01:03:24.090
If it isn't Humpty Numpty
sitting on top of a collapsing wall

01:03:24.217 --> 01:03:27.302
like some clueless egg cunt.

01:03:27.428 --> 01:03:28.804
Now, I'm finished.

01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:30.847
Hi, Jamie, this is Toby.

01:03:30.973 --> 01:03:34.518
Oh, um... Toby Rice, I'm Simon's aide.

01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:37.854
Hi, Toby, Toby. Very pleased
to meet you. Please sit down.

01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:41.107
Now, right, that's enough of all
the fucking Oxbridge pleasantries.

01:03:41.234 --> 01:03:44.820
- What's Oxbridge about saying hello?
- Shut it, Love Actually!

01:03:44.946 --> 01:03:46.863
Do you want me
to hole punch your face?

01:03:46.989 --> 01:03:50.075
Right, I'm off to deal
with the fate of the planet.

01:03:50.201 --> 01:03:52.118
Be gentle with them.

01:03:52.245 --> 01:03:55.914
Oh, you know me, Malc. Kid gloves...
but made from real kids.

01:03:56.999 --> 01:03:59.960
Right, Butch and Gaydance,
this wall story is playing badly.

01:04:00.086 --> 01:04:02.128
There's a cartoon
of you in here as a walrus.

01:04:02.255 --> 01:04:04.256
A walrus?

01:04:04.382 --> 01:04:06.842
I'm not fat,
I don't even have a moustache.

01:04:07.844 --> 01:04:09.678
Fuck, they've given me tusks.

01:04:09.804 --> 01:04:11.721
- Wal-rus.
- Yes, I know.

01:04:11.848 --> 01:04:13.390
You get it? Wal-rus, wal-rus.

01:04:13.516 --> 01:04:17.143
We called some builders. They didn't
turn up when they said they would.

01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:19.145
What did you expect?

01:04:19.272 --> 01:04:20.981
They're builders!

01:04:21.107 --> 01:04:24.693
Have you ever seen a film
where the hero is a builder?

01:04:24.819 --> 01:04:28.321
No, no, because they never
fucking turn up in the nick of time.

01:04:28.447 --> 01:04:30.407
Bat-builder? Spider-builder? Huh?

01:04:30.533 --> 01:04:33.952
That's why you never see
a superhero with a hod.

01:04:34.078 --> 01:04:36.329
You know, my theory
is Malcolm built him in a lab

01:04:36.455 --> 01:04:38.540
out of bits of old psychopath.

01:04:38.666 --> 01:04:40.375
Hello, ladies.

01:04:40.501 --> 01:04:42.711
OK, well,
I'm just going to go to the bar.

01:04:42.837 --> 01:04:44.713
Good idea, we're on the Sancerre.

01:04:44.839 --> 01:04:47.966
- If you can afford that.
- If you can get served at the bar.

01:04:48.092 --> 01:04:51.177
- Yes, thank you, Oscar Wilde.
- He might not get served, bless him.

01:04:51.304 --> 01:04:53.346
Toby's got a message. Hang on.

01:04:56.058 --> 01:04:58.018
What's that?

01:04:59.061 --> 01:05:02.188
- Oh, fucking wow, I don't believe it.
- What?

01:05:02.315 --> 01:05:05.108
I don't fucking... I don't believe it,
he's done it again.

01:05:06.152 --> 01:05:08.778
Little shit, he's such a shit.

01:05:10.364 --> 01:05:11.907
What?

01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:14.326
- Here he is.
- There you are.

01:05:14.452 --> 01:05:16.786
The finest Sancerre
in the Westminster reach.

01:05:16.913 --> 01:05:19.956
So, this Liza, you shagged her, yeah?

01:05:20.082 --> 01:05:21.374
What? No.

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:24.669
Were you aware he was ball-deep
in some Washington wonk?

01:05:24.795 --> 01:05:27.339
- Suzy!
- I didn't know anything about his balls.

01:05:27.465 --> 01:05:30.967
Can we not discuss my balls
and accusations in...

01:05:31.093 --> 01:05:34.596
Just tell me why. Huh?

01:05:37.099 --> 01:05:41.895
I don't know, Suzy. It was very weird
over there, very intense.

01:05:42.021 --> 01:05:43.063
Right.

01:05:43.189 --> 01:05:47.817
Maybe, I don't know,
on some level, subconsciously,

01:05:47.944 --> 01:05:52.572
it was like a... it was just...
it was a last-ditch attempt to...

01:05:53.616 --> 01:05:58.620
...stop this... awful war, you know?

01:06:00.247 --> 01:06:03.041
Just on a... I mean, you know,
I don't mean, obviously, to try...

01:06:03.167 --> 01:06:05.085
- Wow.
- That's classic.

01:06:05.211 --> 01:06:06.836
...to try and actually stop it.

01:06:06.963 --> 01:06:09.589
Toby, did you just say
that you had sex to stop the war?

01:06:09.715 --> 01:06:10.632
No, no, no.

01:06:10.758 --> 01:06:14.970
An anti-war shag? Is that what you
thought, Toby? Because, that's... Wow.

01:06:15.096 --> 01:06:16.680
Can we just go and discuss this

01:06:16.806 --> 01:06:19.808
somewhere where there aren't
enormous children eating snacks?

01:06:19.934 --> 01:06:23.812
He's got his little cannons
and he's got his little guns, and...

01:06:25.064 --> 01:06:28.233
...this is the problem
with civilians wanting to go to war.

01:06:28.359 --> 01:06:30.652
Once you've been there,
once you've seen it,

01:06:30.778 --> 01:06:33.989
you never want to go again,
unless you absolutely fucking have to.

01:06:35.032 --> 01:06:37.033
It's like France.

01:06:38.411 --> 01:06:39.995
Is there anything besides this to eat?

01:06:40.121 --> 01:06:43.123
Have something else.
This has got a little protein, have that.

01:06:43.249 --> 01:06:45.208
What's this, fish ass?

01:06:45.334 --> 01:06:48.420
- So, you read Liza's paper, I guess?
- Yeah,

01:06:48.546 --> 01:06:50.672
I'm a voracious reader.

01:06:50.798 --> 01:06:53.299
I am the Gore Vidal of the Pentagon.

01:06:53.426 --> 01:06:54.426
Gore's gay.

01:06:54.552 --> 01:06:55.468
No, he's not.

01:06:55.594 --> 01:06:57.470
I beg to differ, but...

01:06:57.596 --> 01:07:00.849
He's gay? Because I've been saying
that Gore Vidal line.

01:07:00.975 --> 01:07:02.308
He is gay.

01:07:03.394 --> 01:07:05.437
Guess, I'd better stop saying that, then.

01:07:05.563 --> 01:07:07.147
It's ridiculous.

01:07:07.273 --> 01:07:10.442
The case against war
is far stronger than the case for war

01:07:10.568 --> 01:07:12.902
and the case for war
is caveated all to hell.

01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:15.155
"Most analysts
believe the state is looking

01:07:15.281 --> 01:07:17.782
to expand aggressively
beyond its borders. "

01:07:17.908 --> 01:07:20.493
Then you look down the caveats.
"The only source is "Ice Man".

01:07:20.619 --> 01:07:23.997
A possible alcoholic" - he probably does
ten bags of methamphetamine a day.

01:07:24.123 --> 01:07:25.331
The Ice Man.

01:07:25.458 --> 01:07:27.167
If he even exists.

01:07:27.293 --> 01:07:31.504
"The INR says we can't trust him. "
We're disputing our own intelligence.

01:07:31.630 --> 01:07:33.465
We should leak this, you know.

01:07:33.591 --> 01:07:35.175
When do you wanna leak it?

01:07:36.218 --> 01:07:37.260
Me?

01:07:37.386 --> 01:07:39.679
- Isn't that what you were suggesting?
- No.

01:07:39.805 --> 01:07:41.723
You don't have to say
that it came from you.

01:07:41.849 --> 01:07:43.892
No, I'm not leaking it.

01:07:46.062 --> 01:07:48.063
Liza looks good today.

01:07:52.902 --> 01:07:56.529
- I mean, has Linton read this thing?
- I don't think Linton reads.

01:08:00.534 --> 01:08:03.078
Why don't you give it
a couple of weeks to settle down?

01:08:03.204 --> 01:08:06.164
Oh, great, just what we need.
Old Anti-war Fuck is back.

01:08:06.290 --> 01:08:09.084
- What the fuck's Cocoon doing here?
- What are you doing here?

01:08:09.210 --> 01:08:11.753
- Well, I live here.
- Well, you don't, actually, Toby.

01:08:11.879 --> 01:08:15.090
- Want another cup of tea, Michael?
- Yes, please. I'd love one.

01:08:15.216 --> 01:08:17.841
OK, right, I'm taking
all my stuff from the kitchen.

01:08:17.968 --> 01:08:19.803
- Do you want me to go?
- No, you stay there.

01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:22.555
He's just getting his brie
and his peri-peri.

01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:25.517
- Do you want me to help him pack?
- And certainly my quince paste.

01:08:25.643 --> 01:08:27.560
Quince paste, he's such a prick.

01:08:27.685 --> 01:08:29.938
Just going to gather up his shit clothes.

01:08:30.064 --> 01:08:31.272
Shut up.

01:08:33.399 --> 01:08:36.152
That's not how you fold them.

01:08:36.278 --> 01:08:39.531
I'm not going to fucking Fiji,
I'm getting chucked out of my house.

01:08:39.657 --> 01:08:41.573
They're all going in bin liners.

01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:43.952
It makes all the difference
at the other end.

01:08:44.078 --> 01:08:46.578
There is no other end, that's the point.

01:08:46.705 --> 01:08:48.957
- Has she got big tits?
- Oh, Christ alive.

01:08:49.082 --> 01:08:51.584
Yes, actually, she has.
She's got massive tits. Yes.

01:08:51.710 --> 01:08:54.671
Look them up on Google Earth.
They've got their own postcode.

01:08:54.796 --> 01:08:57.006
They're so enormous
that they actually

01:08:57.133 --> 01:08:59.259
suck in other tits
from the surrounding area.

01:08:59.385 --> 01:09:01.426
Like you?

01:09:04.055 --> 01:09:05.765
Thanks. See you, then.

01:09:05.890 --> 01:09:07.600
OK.

01:09:07.725 --> 01:09:09.435
Um...

01:09:09.562 --> 01:09:14.149
Suzy, this is probably going to sound a
bit odd under the circumstances, but...

01:09:14.274 --> 01:09:15.817
A quickie?

01:09:15.943 --> 01:09:19.237
No. Thank you, but no.

01:09:19.363 --> 01:09:21.698
It's about Liza.

01:09:21.823 --> 01:09:24.033
Liza wrote a paper, it's called PWIP PIP.

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:26.077
- PWIP what?
- PWIP PIP.

01:09:26.203 --> 01:09:28.872
Who wrote that? Charles Dickens?

01:09:28.997 --> 01:09:31.916
- Post War Planning Implications...
- Yeah, all right.

01:09:32.042 --> 01:09:36.421
Right. I think, it could, if it was leaked,
stop this kind of rush towards a war,

01:09:36.546 --> 01:09:38.798
you know, too quickly, that sort of thing.

01:09:38.924 --> 01:09:42.301
- Just if it was leaked.
- You are such a coward.

01:09:42.428 --> 01:09:46.598
Take your backlog of Mojo
and your shit clothes,

01:09:46.724 --> 01:09:49.642
and your eighth of dope
and your flute and piss off.

01:09:51.187 --> 01:09:54.063
OK, I'll just leave it there.

01:10:00.779 --> 01:10:03.323
- I need advice myself.
- Let's take care of the car.

01:10:03.449 --> 01:10:06.284
This should not be here.
This should not be here.

01:10:06.410 --> 01:10:08.453
Sir. Everyone.

01:10:09.121 --> 01:10:11.664
- The car is ready?
- All taken care of, sir.

01:10:11.790 --> 01:10:14.626
- I'm handling travel.
- Why are people running around?

01:10:14.752 --> 01:10:16.669
This had better be a fucking fire drill.

01:10:16.795 --> 01:10:21.174
The President just announced he's
vetoing tariffs on Chinese auto imports.

01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:23.635
That means, right,
he's buttering the Chinese up?

01:10:23.761 --> 01:10:27.513
That he needs the Chinese to at least
abstain on the Security Council.

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:29.515
OK, so we're going to the UN.

01:10:29.642 --> 01:10:32.644
- Yes, we're going to the UN.
- Shit.

01:10:32.770 --> 01:10:34.812
Why didn't you tell me, Liza?

01:10:35.856 --> 01:10:37.523
Since I created the budget deficit,

01:10:37.650 --> 01:10:40.693
the President doesn't tend
to run things by me any more.

01:10:40.819 --> 01:10:43.279
Don't get funny with me.
I am not in the mood to joke.

01:10:43.405 --> 01:10:45.698
I'm... I'm getting that.

01:10:45.824 --> 01:10:49.994
If you say we're leaving in ten minutes
that means we're leaving right now.

01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:53.248
Not that I don't trust you,
but I don't trust you.

01:10:53.374 --> 01:10:55.083
I am gonna go into Linton's office

01:10:55.209 --> 01:10:57.794
and I'm gonna pull the little pin
on that fucking grenade.

01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:59.712
- Don't do that.
- I'm fucking joking.

01:10:59.838 --> 01:11:00.880
I'm not gonna do that.

01:11:01.006 --> 01:11:02.924
We have an elevator waiting for us.

01:11:03.050 --> 01:11:05.343
Good. Step in,
thank you very much, just...

01:11:05.469 --> 01:11:07.512
I just...

01:11:08.514 --> 01:11:11.391
This job is incredibly stressful,
you know that?

01:11:11.517 --> 01:11:14.227
Simon, you're not a lion tamer,

01:11:14.353 --> 01:11:17.230
you're not a snooker player.

01:11:17.356 --> 01:11:20.275
I don't want to back a war, Judy.

01:11:21.318 --> 01:11:25.738
Look, put some hints out there,
put some nods and some winks out

01:11:25.864 --> 01:11:30.326
that I'm toying with resignation, OK?
See if the PM reacts.

01:11:30.452 --> 01:11:33.413
- You want me to put out some winks?
- And nods, yeah.

01:11:33.539 --> 01:11:35.248
What? Big nods?

01:11:35.374 --> 01:11:37.750
No, no, just sort of...
that sort of size nod.

01:11:37.876 --> 01:11:38.918
OK.

01:11:39.044 --> 01:11:40.753
No, no, that's much too big.

01:11:40.879 --> 01:11:44.340
I'm just nodding normally to say
I understand the need for a small nod.

01:11:44.466 --> 01:11:46.134
Oh, yeah. No, no, sorry, yeah.

01:11:46.885 --> 01:11:50.471
All right now, my lovely friends,
the bottom line is...

01:11:50.597 --> 01:11:52.807
Oh, God, I hate that phrase.
"Bottom line. "

01:11:52.933 --> 01:11:54.434
I mean, we're not in retailing.

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:57.061
Sorry. Michael's quite right.
I won't use that again.

01:11:57.187 --> 01:11:59.480
The bottom line is the President
is going to the UN.

01:11:59.606 --> 01:12:02.567
This will be the vote to commence
military intervention.

01:12:04.028 --> 01:12:06.988
And the Prime Minister has decided
that we should join him.

01:12:07.114 --> 01:12:08.698
Rob, Innis,

01:12:08.824 --> 01:12:11.868
Little Bo Cock Jockey
and the Leakey Fucking Mingebox,

01:12:11.994 --> 01:12:13.619
go back to your desks

01:12:13.746 --> 01:12:15.663
and prepare to start briefing now.

01:12:15.789 --> 01:12:17.915
Michael, do you mind
if we use your office?

01:12:18.042 --> 01:12:19.584
- What?
- For a couple of minutes?

01:12:19.710 --> 01:12:22.754
Yeah. Michael, sorry. Bottom line
is, can you come out again?

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:25.757
Um... might need to turn the music off.

01:12:25.883 --> 01:12:26.924
Yes.

01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:29.427
- Right.
- OK.

01:12:29.553 --> 01:12:31.596
So, this is all going to spin along
from here.

01:12:31.722 --> 01:12:33.473
We're going to have a vote
and go to war.

01:12:33.599 --> 01:12:36.434
We'll fight people, kill them.
Our children will get killed.

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:38.102
This is exactly the sort of thing

01:12:38.228 --> 01:12:40.897
that I didn't want to do
when I went into politics.

01:12:41.023 --> 01:12:43.608
This is the opposite
of what I wanted to be doing.

01:12:43.734 --> 01:12:46.527
That's why you have to stay
in Government, to influence things.

01:12:46.653 --> 01:12:49.155
In here, you can influence things,
you can delay things.

01:12:49.281 --> 01:12:50.656
Out there, you're just another

01:12:50.783 --> 01:12:54.077
mouthy, shouty mad fucker who people
don't want to make eye contact with.

01:12:54.203 --> 01:12:57.163
Remember Mary? Remember what
happened? She took a stand on health.

01:12:57.289 --> 01:12:59.123
Everybody decided
that she was mental.

01:12:59.249 --> 01:13:01.042
Because The Sun
showed a picture of her

01:13:01.168 --> 01:13:03.086
with wide eyes and her head on a cow.

01:13:03.212 --> 01:13:05.630
I happened to find that a particularly
powerful image.

01:13:05.756 --> 01:13:08.549
Look... the Prime Minister
of this country,

01:13:08.675 --> 01:13:10.635
he's not a fucking Viking, is he?

01:13:10.761 --> 01:13:12.303
He doesn't drink blood.

01:13:12.429 --> 01:13:14.180
He doesn't go around biting tramps.

01:13:14.306 --> 01:13:17.141
I know the Prime Minister
isn't a Viking, Malcolm.

01:13:17.267 --> 01:13:19.894
Unlike me,
he abhors physical violence.

01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:22.355
Where is the intelligence,
the hard evidence?

01:13:22.481 --> 01:13:24.524
We have got the fucking intelligence.

01:13:24.650 --> 01:13:27.360
- I haven't seen it.
- The intelligence we've got is so deep,

01:13:27.486 --> 01:13:30.279
so fucking hard,
it'll fucking puncture your kidneys.

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:32.698
Where's it coming from?

01:13:32.825 --> 01:13:34.742
There is an informant.

01:13:34.868 --> 01:13:36.327
Ice Man.

01:13:36.995 --> 01:13:38.496
Ice Man?

01:13:39.164 --> 01:13:41.916
I don't name them. Ice Man. Yeah.

01:13:42.042 --> 01:13:44.752
And the fact is,
the stuff that he's given us is...

01:13:44.878 --> 01:13:46.504
I've seen it.

01:13:46.630 --> 01:13:49.173
It would make your blood run cold

01:13:49.967 --> 01:13:53.177
and clot and turn your insides
into fucking black puddings,

01:13:53.303 --> 01:13:55.179
but certain box lickers

01:13:55.305 --> 01:13:57.765
are sitting on it,
but you're going to see it,

01:13:57.891 --> 01:13:59.809
because the PM regards you

01:13:59.935 --> 01:14:01.727
as a key player in this now.

01:14:01.854 --> 01:14:05.356
Simon, the Prime Minister wants
to speak to you in ten minutes.

01:14:05.482 --> 01:14:07.358
He wants you to go to the UN.

01:14:07.484 --> 01:14:08.401
OK.

01:14:08.527 --> 01:14:10.194
See? You're on the A list now.

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:13.114
You're there in the VIP lounge.
You're a fucking Kennedy.

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:14.365
Yeah, Malcolm...

01:14:14.491 --> 01:14:16.701
You've got the gold card,
the complimentary drinks,

01:14:16.827 --> 01:14:18.202
the fucking hard on.

01:14:18.328 --> 01:14:21.539
Show me the evidence -
my bottom fucking line.

01:14:21.665 --> 01:14:23.541
Don't you start, as well.

01:14:26.879 --> 01:14:28.337
Should I resign?

01:14:29.339 --> 01:14:33.551
I floated that I might, then I thought I
wouldn't, so it'll look convincing if I did.

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:37.972
I mean, do you think,
is it braver to just resign

01:14:38.098 --> 01:14:40.141
and say, "No. No war"?

01:14:41.143 --> 01:14:42.560
- Yes.
- Or...

01:14:42.686 --> 01:14:44.228
is it braver...

01:14:45.439 --> 01:14:47.148
...to say, "I don't agree",

01:14:47.274 --> 01:14:49.442
and just grit my teeth
and get on with it?

01:14:49.568 --> 01:14:50.568
No.

01:14:50.694 --> 01:14:54.238
Is the really brave thing
actually doing what you don't believe?

01:14:54.364 --> 01:14:55.239
No.

01:14:55.365 --> 01:14:56.741
Maybe.

01:14:56.867 --> 01:14:58.159
Because...

01:14:58.285 --> 01:15:01.787
What's actually brave
about doing the right thing?

01:15:01.914 --> 01:15:02.830
Nothing.

01:15:02.956 --> 01:15:04.957
You know, doing the wrong thing is...

01:15:05.083 --> 01:15:06.459
is... is braver,

01:15:06.585 --> 01:15:08.252
in a way, isn't it?

01:15:09.254 --> 01:15:11.964
And wars do sometimes work.

01:15:13.091 --> 01:15:14.425
That erm...

01:15:14.551 --> 01:15:16.427
the War for Independence.

01:15:16.553 --> 01:15:19.430
You know, that worked
for the Americans, didn't it?

01:15:19.556 --> 01:15:21.015
And... erm...

01:15:22.935 --> 01:15:24.769
The Second World War.

01:15:24.895 --> 01:15:28.022
I know, it's not...
It wasn't a good idea, millions died.

01:15:28.148 --> 01:15:29.774
No, no, I know what you mean.

01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:32.193
The Crimean War.
We got nurses out of that.

01:15:32.319 --> 01:15:34.237
- Nurses are good.
- Yes. Exactly.

01:15:34.363 --> 01:15:36.405
So, right, well, no, exactly.

01:15:39.952 --> 01:15:40.952
So...

01:15:42.412 --> 01:15:44.205
You're not resigning?

01:15:49.211 --> 01:15:51.837
In the motorcade, can we get
a car without Judy, please?

01:15:51.964 --> 01:15:53.965
You want hookers?
You like hooky fucky, sir?

01:15:54.091 --> 01:15:55.466
No, I don't want...

01:15:55.592 --> 01:15:58.010
- I want to talk about resigning.
- What again?

01:15:58.136 --> 01:16:00.179
Yes, but with you and not her.

01:16:05.310 --> 01:16:09.313
So, the wires are all currently reporting
that you're going to resign over the war.

01:16:09.439 --> 01:16:11.440
What? That's not supposed
to get outside.

01:16:11.567 --> 01:16:15.486
Well, it is outside. It's lurking outside,
like a big hairy rapist at a coach station.

01:16:16.905 --> 01:16:20.032
Do you know, if I could,
I'd fucking punch you into paralysis.

01:16:23.996 --> 01:16:26.664
So, you must be Simon.
I'm the British Ambassador to the UN,

01:16:26.790 --> 01:16:28.291
Sir Jonathon Tutt.

01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:31.669
Well, this is it, ladies and gentlemen.
This is the United Nations.

01:16:31.795 --> 01:16:33.921
We, sir, are in here.

01:16:34.047 --> 01:16:36.924
So, if there's anything you need,
just give me a whistle.

01:16:37.050 --> 01:16:39.302
You know how to do that, don't you?
What do you do?

01:16:39.428 --> 01:16:42.847
Hm? That's right. You put your lips
together and you blow.

01:16:44.016 --> 01:16:46.475
I'm going to head up to
this delegates' reception.

01:16:46.602 --> 01:16:49.478
I hope there's some nibbles,
because I'm ravenous.

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:53.357
Nibbles. Who still says "nibbles"?

01:16:53.483 --> 01:16:56.694
Fuck the nibbles.
What was with the homoerotic tension?

01:16:56.820 --> 01:17:00.531
OK. Your phone is off,
but there's been a catastrofuck here.

01:17:00.657 --> 01:17:03.784
Someone's leaked Liza Weld's
PWIP PIP paper to the BBC.

01:17:03.910 --> 01:17:05.703
Jesus Christ!

01:17:06.747 --> 01:17:08.331
Ah, there we go.

01:17:09.333 --> 01:17:13.044
I reckon it's going to be on the six
o'clock news, one o'clock your time.

01:17:13.170 --> 01:17:16.714
That is going to fucking fist
your UN vote to death.

01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:17.798
Hey, you! Freeze!

01:17:17.924 --> 01:17:20.384
Right. Missing you loads.
PWIP PIP toodle-oo.

01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:22.428
I want a fucking word with you.

01:17:22.554 --> 01:17:24.180
OK, Jamie, two jobs.

01:17:24.306 --> 01:17:28.100
Job one. Find the PWIP PIP leaker
and kill them. Job one has two parts.

01:17:28.226 --> 01:17:31.354
Job two. Go to the BBC
and find out who's got it there.

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:34.065
We need them to delay
till after the vote. Yeah?

01:17:34.191 --> 01:17:35.566
I love you.

01:17:39.571 --> 01:17:41.739
Excuse me, I need a word with you.

01:17:41.865 --> 01:17:43.949
Do not move from here
or I'll fucking stab you.

01:17:44.076 --> 01:17:44.825
OK.

01:17:44.951 --> 01:17:46.911
- Right. Was it you?
- No, it wasn't.

01:17:47.037 --> 01:17:47.912
No. What?

01:17:48.038 --> 01:17:50.122
- You know what I'm talking about.
- No.

01:17:50.248 --> 01:17:52.083
And... And... whatever it was,

01:17:52.209 --> 01:17:54.126
I almost certainly didn't do it.

01:17:54.252 --> 01:17:56.087
- You, the baby from Eraserhead?
- No, no.

01:17:56.213 --> 01:17:57.963
Then it must be you,
woman from The Crying Game.

01:17:58.090 --> 01:17:59.423
It wasn't me.

01:17:59.549 --> 01:18:01.634
You've really got it in for me,
haven't you?

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:04.428
Listen, somebody has dropped
a bollock in the noodles here.

01:18:04.554 --> 01:18:05.971
And I reckon it was you.

01:18:06.098 --> 01:18:08.432
- Nice logic.
- Yeah, no, that sounds possible.

01:18:08.558 --> 01:18:10.267
Will you just keep your nib out?

01:18:10.394 --> 01:18:11.936
Psychologically speaking.

01:18:12.062 --> 01:18:14.021
- Springer spaniel head.
- It's plausible.

01:18:14.147 --> 01:18:17.441
You might have built up a resentment
and paid it off in some underhand way.

01:18:17.567 --> 01:18:19.360
That's a thing I've observed people do.

01:18:19.486 --> 01:18:21.153
Observe that.

01:18:21.279 --> 01:18:23.614
- Right, Baldermort.
- Bloody hell, Malcolm.

01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:25.074
Excuse us.

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:26.992
We are in a new reality here.

01:18:27.119 --> 01:18:28.244
- OK?
- Right.

01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:30.830
And I need you to speed things up.

01:18:30.956 --> 01:18:32.665
OK. Speed what up, Malcolm?

01:18:32.791 --> 01:18:35.167
- The debate.
- Right.

01:18:35.293 --> 01:18:38.629
I need you to bring it
from 1:30pm to 11 am.

01:18:38.755 --> 01:18:43.008
Right. Let me tell you how the process
works here and why that's not possible.

01:18:43.135 --> 01:18:46.220
Just fucking do it, otherwise you'll find
yourself in the Caucuses,

01:18:46.346 --> 01:18:47.805
in a Medieval fucking war zone,

01:18:47.931 --> 01:18:50.474
arse in the air, trying to persuade
men in balaclavas

01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:54.437
that sustained sexual violence
is not the fucking way forward, OK?

01:18:54.563 --> 01:18:57.857
It cannot be done and it will not
be done. There's an end to it.

01:18:57.983 --> 01:18:59.483
Ok, I'll do it. Through here?

01:18:59.609 --> 01:19:02.194
You will not do it
because that is a breach of protocol.

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:04.071
- Well, you do it.
- No, I will not do it.

01:19:04.197 --> 01:19:06.449
- In there. Do it.
- I'm not dancing with you on this.

01:19:06.575 --> 01:19:08.784
- Get through there and do it, now.
- I'm not.

01:19:10.036 --> 01:19:11.245
Right... well...

01:19:11.371 --> 01:19:13.080
Erm... everyone, if I could just...

01:19:13.206 --> 01:19:14.457
Is this...

01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:16.083
Can you hear me?

01:19:16.209 --> 01:19:19.295
I just wondered if we might er...
ask for a...

01:19:21.006 --> 01:19:22.423
...a cheeky early vote,

01:19:22.549 --> 01:19:24.925
a sort of a little bit of an adventure.

01:19:25.051 --> 01:19:26.552
Yeah, we've got to plug that leak.

01:19:26.678 --> 01:19:29.346
I don't know what else they've got
and where's this intel?

01:19:29.473 --> 01:19:32.850
Are you sure you're working as hard
as me? I'm sweating spinal fluid here.

01:19:32.976 --> 01:19:34.477
I'm a fucking husk.

01:19:34.603 --> 01:19:35.853
Jesus.

01:19:36.855 --> 01:19:40.024
- Got everything you need?
- Yeah. Yeah, thanks.

01:19:40.150 --> 01:19:41.233
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:19:41.902 --> 01:19:43.194
General Flintstone.

01:19:44.446 --> 01:19:45.863
Was it you?

01:19:45.989 --> 01:19:48.073
Did you leak PWIP PIP?

01:19:48.867 --> 01:19:51.869
I mean, I know you can't fire a gun,
but can you use a fax?

01:19:51.995 --> 01:19:54.705
No, I didn't leak PWIP PIP.
I do everything up front. OK?

01:19:54.831 --> 01:19:57.875
Not like some creepy little gay
mercenary that sneaks around

01:19:58.001 --> 01:19:59.585
doing other people's dirty work.

01:19:59.711 --> 01:20:01.378
Hey, I am doing my own work.

01:20:01.505 --> 01:20:02.755
I'm doing my job.

01:20:02.881 --> 01:20:04.882
No, you're doing Linton's dirty work.

01:20:05.008 --> 01:20:06.926
You're his English bitch
and you don't even know it.

01:20:07.052 --> 01:20:10.095
I bet if I went into your hotel room
tonight, I'd see you on all fours,

01:20:10.222 --> 01:20:12.556
little fishnets on,
him hanging onto the back of you.

01:20:12.682 --> 01:20:14.225
Oh, that's nice, that's nice.

01:20:14.351 --> 01:20:17.228
That's tough talk coming from
a fucking armchair general.

01:20:17.354 --> 01:20:20.189
Why don't you put your feet up
on a pouf and go back to sleep?

01:20:20.315 --> 01:20:23.901
Tucker, you might be a scary little
poodle fucker, back there in London,

01:20:24.027 --> 01:20:25.361
but here you're nothing.

01:20:25.487 --> 01:20:27.279
You know what you look like?

01:20:28.281 --> 01:20:29.740
A squeezed dick.

01:20:29.866 --> 01:20:33.285
You've got a little blue vein
running up the side of your head.

01:20:33.411 --> 01:20:35.162
See, that's where I'd put the bullet.

01:20:35.288 --> 01:20:39.083
But I'd have to stand back,
cos you look like you'd be a squirter.

01:20:39.209 --> 01:20:40.918
Have you ever, even actually...

01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:43.629
...killed anybody, I mean, really?

01:20:43.755 --> 01:20:44.922
Yeah.

01:20:45.715 --> 01:20:47.800
Falling asleep on someone.
That doesn't count.

01:20:47.926 --> 01:20:49.635
That's good. That's good.

01:20:49.761 --> 01:20:52.012
How about you, pussy drip,
ever kill anybody?

01:20:52.138 --> 01:20:54.723
Maiming is what I prefer,
psychologically.

01:20:54.850 --> 01:20:56.433
Why don't you try to maim me?

01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:59.728
I'll hit you so hard in the face,
you'll be shitting teeth.

01:21:00.772 --> 01:21:02.147
Go right ahead.

01:21:02.274 --> 01:21:04.191
I can see the headlines right now.

01:21:04.317 --> 01:21:07.945
"Peace-loving general starts fight
at the UN. Swiss intervene. "

01:21:08.071 --> 01:21:11.782
I don't know, I'm not an expert on spin,
but that could hurt your career.

01:21:11.908 --> 01:21:12.783
Yeah?

01:21:12.909 --> 01:21:14.118
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:21:17.122 --> 01:21:18.539
Now, do excuse me.

01:21:18.665 --> 01:21:20.291
I've got work to do.

01:21:22.127 --> 01:21:24.503
Don't ever call me
fucking English again.

01:21:28.425 --> 01:21:30.301
Suzy, well done.

01:21:30.427 --> 01:21:32.136
This is absolutely superb.

01:21:32.262 --> 01:21:34.597
Hey, horse of the year, was it you?

01:21:34.723 --> 01:21:37.224
- Was what me?
- Answer the fucking question!

01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:38.475
Was it you?

01:21:38.602 --> 01:21:41.687
Was what me, Jamie? I have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:21:41.813 --> 01:21:45.566
She can't answer the question,
can she? Unless she knows what it is.

01:21:45.692 --> 01:21:46.859
You...

01:21:46.985 --> 01:21:50.154
leaked Liza Weld's paper
to the BBC, right?

01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:53.073
Now, tell me you leaked it.

01:21:54.576 --> 01:21:56.785
No, I didn't. I didn't leak it.

01:21:56.912 --> 01:21:58.412
I know...

01:21:58.538 --> 01:22:01.165
the leak came from in here.

01:22:01.291 --> 01:22:02.833
From...

01:22:02.959 --> 01:22:06.712
this fucking fax machine right here.

01:22:06.838 --> 01:22:09.340
No. There's no... There's no way.

01:22:10.383 --> 01:22:11.675
Do you see...

01:22:11.801 --> 01:22:13.510
what I'm doing to this machine?

01:22:13.637 --> 01:22:15.304
- Jamie, don't.
- See?

01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:16.847
Jesus Christ!

01:22:16.973 --> 01:22:18.390
Fuck, Jamie.

01:22:18.516 --> 01:22:21.352
You see how... angry I am with the...

01:22:21.478 --> 01:22:26.231
piece of office equipment
that leaked this document?

01:22:26.358 --> 01:22:27.274
Huh?

01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:28.609
Michael.

01:22:28.735 --> 01:22:33.864
Can you even imagine how angry I am
with the person who leaked it, can you?

01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:37.034
- That's really... expensive, Jamie.
- Can you, Suzy?

01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:39.495
Jamie, it was me.

01:22:39.621 --> 01:22:42.706
Oh, don't come over
all fucking Spartacus on us now.

01:22:42.832 --> 01:22:44.541
- I leaked it.
- What are you doing?

01:22:44.668 --> 01:22:46.543
No, hang on, hang on. For a start...

01:22:46.670 --> 01:22:48.629
turn that fucking racket off!

01:22:48.755 --> 01:22:50.881
Turn it off.
- It's just vowels.

01:22:51.883 --> 01:22:55.052
Subsidised foreign fucking vowels.

01:22:56.054 --> 01:22:59.723
The only reason you listen to this shit
is because it's bad form

01:22:59.849 --> 01:23:02.226
to actually wear a hat that says,

01:23:02.352 --> 01:23:04.228
"I went to private school. "

01:23:04.354 --> 01:23:05.896
So, tell me now, right.

01:23:06.022 --> 01:23:08.357
- Who did you leak it to?
- I just sent it.

01:23:08.483 --> 01:23:10.901
I read it, I thought it was important,
so I sent it.

01:23:11.027 --> 01:23:13.445
Good. Fine. See that fax?

01:23:13.571 --> 01:23:14.488
Yes.

01:23:14.614 --> 01:23:16.240
That is your career.

01:23:17.033 --> 01:23:20.244
And I think it might be fucked,
but let's just check.

01:23:21.246 --> 01:23:23.330
Yeah, yeah, it's pretty fucked.

01:23:23.456 --> 01:23:25.457
Now, I hope you can play the spoons.

01:23:25.583 --> 01:23:28.585
You're too old to go back
to being a gentleman's fluffer.

01:23:29.754 --> 01:23:31.755
Simon? Simon.

01:23:31.881 --> 01:23:34.675
Congratulations.
I didn't think you had it in you.

01:23:34.801 --> 01:23:35.718
Hi.

01:23:35.844 --> 01:23:37.886
- This is great, Simon.
- He's resigning.

01:23:38.013 --> 01:23:40.097
Have you seen it? It's a good picture.

01:23:40.223 --> 01:23:42.599
- They're running with that?
In a very big way.

01:23:42.726 --> 01:23:44.393
I didn't say that.

01:23:44.519 --> 01:23:45.436
What?

01:23:45.562 --> 01:23:47.730
- What?
- You're not resigning?

01:23:47.856 --> 01:23:49.773
Are you still playing the hawk?

01:23:49.899 --> 01:23:53.193
In a way, it's... I'm playing a much
cleverer game than that.

01:23:53.319 --> 01:23:54.528
I'm a...

01:23:54.654 --> 01:23:56.447
I'm a fake hawk.

01:23:57.449 --> 01:23:58.741
A what?

01:23:59.576 --> 01:24:01.160
A fake hawk.

01:24:02.704 --> 01:24:04.288
You're an idiot.

01:24:05.373 --> 01:24:07.583
Or are you being a fake idiot?

01:24:08.460 --> 01:24:12.629
So, we float it, anyway, tell the press
that he confirmed to us he's resigning.

01:24:12.756 --> 01:24:14.506
- That's what we'll do, then.
- What?

01:24:14.632 --> 01:24:17.301
- It's decided, then.
- Sorry. No, it bloody isn't.

01:24:17.427 --> 01:24:18.844
I'm me. OK?

01:24:18.970 --> 01:24:20.763
You're not me.

01:24:21.765 --> 01:24:24.975
I decide about all the main things
about me.

01:24:25.101 --> 01:24:26.810
- Not any more.
- Not you, me.

01:24:26.936 --> 01:24:32.149
Simon, the only thing that we can do
to influence events now is to resign.

01:24:32.275 --> 01:24:33.609
That's it, OK?

01:24:33.735 --> 01:24:36.361
- Sacrifice ourselves.
- Like a suicide bomber?

01:24:36.488 --> 01:24:40.407
No, not like suicide bomber.
A suicide bomber makes a decision.

01:24:48.541 --> 01:24:50.167
Are you OK?

01:24:51.586 --> 01:24:54.046
I'm thinking of becoming
a suicide bomber.

01:24:55.006 --> 01:24:56.006
Right.

01:24:57.008 --> 01:24:58.842
- Would you like a mint?
- No.

01:24:58.968 --> 01:25:03.889
They're really not that good
for the teeth, you know, rots them slowly.

01:25:04.015 --> 01:25:06.058
- It's early.
- Do you like me, Judy?

01:25:08.019 --> 01:25:10.521
Well... you're my boss, you know.

01:25:10.647 --> 01:25:12.439
But do you really like me?

01:25:14.192 --> 01:25:15.651
Yeah.

01:25:16.694 --> 01:25:19.696
I'll... I'll just leave you to your thoughts.

01:25:19.823 --> 01:25:20.697
OK?

01:25:20.824 --> 01:25:22.866
I haven't got any thoughts.

01:25:24.536 --> 01:25:26.787
I'm just staring vacantly into space.

01:25:27.872 --> 01:25:30.457
While a distant voice
in the back of my head goes,

01:25:30.583 --> 01:25:32.000
"Oh, shit",

01:25:32.127 --> 01:25:34.628
like a car alarm,
in the middle of the night.

01:25:36.422 --> 01:25:38.298
Why? Has Jamie been round?

01:25:38.424 --> 01:25:40.884
- Because he's...
- This is you, isn't it?

01:25:41.010 --> 01:25:44.638
Suzy, can I phone you back in a few
minutes for a further bollocking?

01:25:44.764 --> 01:25:46.473
I'll just deal with this one here.

01:25:46.599 --> 01:25:49.810
I have got something really, really big
in my career lined up for me

01:25:49.936 --> 01:25:52.396
and you're going to fuck it up
because of this leak.

01:25:52.522 --> 01:25:54.439
What did you...?
What would be fucked up?

01:25:54.566 --> 01:25:57.025
Chad, I don't need to tell you anything.

01:25:57.152 --> 01:25:58.610
I want to tell you a story.

01:25:58.736 --> 01:26:00.904
When the Titanic went down,
there were lifeboats.

01:26:01.030 --> 01:26:04.283
They had extra room on them
and there were people in the water.

01:26:04.409 --> 01:26:07.286
Some people on the boats just wanted
room to stretch their legs,

01:26:07.412 --> 01:26:10.289
but people in the water froze
and that was on their conscience.

01:26:10.415 --> 01:26:13.250
You talk entirely in parables.
You're like a crap Jesus.

01:26:13.376 --> 01:26:16.253
Tread lightly. OK?
You are fucking with the wrong person.

01:26:16.379 --> 01:26:18.922
- Oh, really?
- Yes. I've got this town on lockdown.

01:26:19.048 --> 01:26:20.757
We're both and so...

01:26:20.884 --> 01:26:22.593
- Fuck you all.
- A common enemy.

01:26:22.719 --> 01:26:23.427
Hello.

01:26:23.553 --> 01:26:24.469
Hello!

01:26:24.596 --> 01:26:26.054
Hello, Paul.

01:26:26.181 --> 01:26:29.892
- Guess what's happened to my wall?
- Could you hold on just a second?

01:26:30.018 --> 01:26:32.436
The Vice President's... Doesn't matter.

01:26:33.521 --> 01:26:35.522
Of America. Yes. That one.

01:26:37.609 --> 01:26:40.569
So, we're getting a little close
to the wire, Mr Tucker.

01:26:40.695 --> 01:26:42.446
Where is that intel, huh?

01:26:42.572 --> 01:26:44.698
What sort of intel have you rustled up?

01:26:44.824 --> 01:26:46.950
- Ah, the smoking intel?
- Yeah.

01:26:47.076 --> 01:26:48.952
Well, honestly, I haven't got it.

01:26:49.078 --> 01:26:50.996
You haven't got it?

01:26:51.122 --> 01:26:52.789
All right. OK.

01:26:52.916 --> 01:26:56.376
Well, then, can you delay the vote?
It'd give you the time to get it.

01:26:56.502 --> 01:26:58.128
I've just had it brought forward.

01:27:00.965 --> 01:27:03.133
Sorry, I'm just erm... getting my mints.

01:27:04.302 --> 01:27:06.678
I am telling you, delay the vote

01:27:06.804 --> 01:27:12.142
and make yourself some time to get
the intel, because I need it, my friend.

01:27:12.268 --> 01:27:14.311
Hey. OK.
Just a quick reality check here,

01:27:14.437 --> 01:27:16.730
J Edgar Fucking Hoover,
I don't work for you.

01:27:16.856 --> 01:27:19.024
You don't fucking tell me what to do.

01:27:19.150 --> 01:27:21.652
OK. Firstly, don't raise your voice.

01:27:21.778 --> 01:27:23.695
This is a sacred place.

01:27:23.821 --> 01:27:26.949
Now, you may not believe that
and I may not believe that,

01:27:27.075 --> 01:27:29.034
but, by God, it's a useful hypocrisy.

01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:31.119
And, secondarily,

01:27:31.246 --> 01:27:35.832
I believe your Prime Minister
has instructed you to work for me.

01:27:37.502 --> 01:27:39.211
Take your sweeties and fuck off.

01:27:40.213 --> 01:27:42.339
Oh, the great Malcolm Tucker.

01:27:42.465 --> 01:27:45.342
One of your guys leaks a paper.
You can't do anything.

01:27:45.468 --> 01:27:48.428
Huh? We tell you to get some intel.
You can't do anything.

01:27:48.554 --> 01:27:51.640
I need you to move the vote back.
You can't do anything.

01:27:51.766 --> 01:27:54.393
I am afraid you are nothing
but a useless piece of

01:27:54.519 --> 01:27:56.979
S star-star T.

01:27:58.189 --> 01:28:00.065
What the fuck do you want?

01:28:00.191 --> 01:28:01.608
Erm... sorry, I...

01:28:01.734 --> 01:28:05.529
I've just heard that the constituency
wall has started to collapse.

01:28:05.655 --> 01:28:08.991
A brick's fallen out. Well, that's
the news I'm getting, at the moment.

01:28:09.117 --> 01:28:10.742
There'll be more to follow.

01:28:10.868 --> 01:28:12.536
News and bricks.

01:28:12.662 --> 01:28:16.039
My God, that sounds important.
Take care of that, Mr Tucker. Yes?

01:28:16.165 --> 01:28:17.874
I think that's more your speed.

01:28:18.001 --> 01:28:22.379
I can see you, with your shirt off and
a wheelbarrow, whistling a happy tune.

01:28:22.505 --> 01:28:23.922
Get on that.

01:28:28.386 --> 01:28:29.886
You work for him?

01:28:30.888 --> 01:28:33.473
This is very fucking complicated stuff.

01:28:33.599 --> 01:28:35.392
After the vote...

01:28:36.394 --> 01:28:37.853
...I resign.

01:28:37.979 --> 01:28:39.396
Oh, fuck off!

01:28:39.522 --> 01:28:40.605
Resigning?

01:28:40.732 --> 01:28:42.399
How fucking impressive!

01:28:42.525 --> 01:28:46.653
Resign. The horse has bolted. It's out
there now. It's getting fucking shot!

01:28:46.779 --> 01:28:48.405
I'll see you later, Malcolm.

01:28:49.949 --> 01:28:51.074
You...

01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:52.743
You repeat...

01:28:52.869 --> 01:28:55.245
one word of what you have heard here

01:28:55.371 --> 01:28:58.874
and I'm going to fucking
take your leg off... I'll fucking...

01:29:00.668 --> 01:29:02.127
The shin bone.

01:29:02.253 --> 01:29:05.797
I'm going to take the shin bone,
I'm going to break it in two

01:29:05.923 --> 01:29:09.926
and I'm going to fucking stab you
to fucking death with it, right?

01:29:10.053 --> 01:29:11.595
So, just... just...

01:29:11.721 --> 01:29:13.013
go away.

01:29:13.139 --> 01:29:14.598
Go away.

01:29:28.821 --> 01:29:30.697
Hi. BBC News Desk, please.

01:29:30.823 --> 01:29:32.449
Malcolm Tucker.

01:29:33.451 --> 01:29:34.826
Hi, Ben.

01:29:34.952 --> 01:29:38.663
Listen, I hear that you might be
preparing a story that we might not like.

01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:40.165
- Yeah, please.
- Ow!

01:29:40.291 --> 01:29:44.127
I just wanted to say, please, this
garden-wall story, don't run with that.

01:29:44.253 --> 01:29:45.170
Ow!

01:29:45.296 --> 01:29:47.631
Simon Foster's constituency office wall.

01:29:47.757 --> 01:29:49.674
That's what you've got, haven't you?

01:29:49.801 --> 01:29:52.511
Oh, shit. I haven't let the cat
out of the bag, have I?

01:29:52.637 --> 01:29:55.847
Please, don't run with that.
My reputation will be in tatters.

01:29:55.973 --> 01:29:58.058
- Ow!
- And he is gone!

01:29:58.184 --> 01:30:00.310
My hand is really
quite badly scalded now.

01:30:00.436 --> 01:30:03.480
I know it was you who leaked
Linton's war committee.

01:30:03.606 --> 01:30:05.649
Oh. Right. Erm...

01:30:07.652 --> 01:30:09.486
- It wasn't.
- It wasn't?

01:30:09.612 --> 01:30:10.821
That's what you'll say

01:30:10.947 --> 01:30:15.450
when they fly you to Diego Garcia
and carry out a cavity search?

01:30:17.078 --> 01:30:18.745
I don't actually recall.

01:30:18.871 --> 01:30:20.789
It was a very busy time.

01:30:20.915 --> 01:30:22.499
That's better. OK.

01:30:22.625 --> 01:30:25.001
I am putting you
on a probationary period

01:30:25.128 --> 01:30:28.171
from today,
until the end of recorded time.

01:30:28.297 --> 01:30:30.173
- All right.
- Do you understand?

01:30:30.299 --> 01:30:32.008
- Yes.
- You're my guy now. Right?

01:30:32.135 --> 01:30:36.388
I own you. You are my Kunta Kinte.
Go and get your fucking laptop.

01:30:38.558 --> 01:30:42.144
Mr Ambassador, with your big, baldy
head, you are spoiling us! A word?

01:30:42.270 --> 01:30:43.854
Excuse us, just for a second.

01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:48.775
I'm pleased to be able to tell you that,
by some huge effort on my behalf,

01:30:48.901 --> 01:30:52.863
I've brought your vote forward
by an hour and a half. Say "thank you".

01:30:52.989 --> 01:30:55.949
- Great. Well, I need it delayed now.
- Very funny.

01:30:56.075 --> 01:30:57.659
By an hour, at least.

01:30:57.785 --> 01:31:01.663
Well, actually, two and a half hours,
now that you've brought it forward.

01:31:01.789 --> 01:31:05.709
No. I will not put myself through that
humiliation again. I'm just not doing it.

01:31:07.044 --> 01:31:10.380
Right.
What can I say? Erm...

01:31:10.506 --> 01:31:14.092
Ah, right, Frank and Nancy Sinatra.
I've got good news for you.

01:31:14.218 --> 01:31:17.304
You're notfired.
That's great news, isn't it?

01:31:17.430 --> 01:31:20.891
- Well, it sounds ominous.
- We want to get Liza Weld's PWIP PIP

01:31:21.017 --> 01:31:24.561
out there properly,
in the public domain.

01:31:24.687 --> 01:31:26.646
We just need to refine it a bit.

01:31:26.772 --> 01:31:28.857
- What do you want to refine?
- Just mess it up.

01:31:28.983 --> 01:31:31.735
Move the paragraphs. Change
the name of the main informant.

01:31:31.861 --> 01:31:35.447
- Well, that's a complete fabrication.
- Changing his name doesn't matter.

01:31:35.573 --> 01:31:38.450
Do you think
he's reallycalled Ice Man? Huh?

01:31:38.576 --> 01:31:41.411
"To Mr and Mrs Man, a son... Ice. "

01:31:41.537 --> 01:31:44.748
- So, change it to another name.
# Sonata for Violin and Piano

01:31:44.874 --> 01:31:46.958
What's the name
of the fuck with the fiddle?

01:31:47.084 --> 01:31:48.919
- This happens to be Debussy.
- Debussy.

01:31:49.045 --> 01:31:52.255
- Well, we'll change it to Debussy, then.
- No, we will not!

01:31:52.381 --> 01:31:55.091
Now, your prints
are gonna be all over this, Michael,

01:31:55.218 --> 01:31:57.969
but that's the only way
you can save your job, you leaky fuck.

01:31:58.095 --> 01:31:59.888
- Don't make me do this.
- It wasn't him.

01:32:00.014 --> 01:32:03.808
Somebody must have come in there
and used the fax machine.

01:32:03.935 --> 01:32:05.810
- It could have been anyone.
- Fax machine?

01:32:05.937 --> 01:32:09.022
Ah, no! Don't worry about that.

01:32:09.148 --> 01:32:11.233
No, I made that up.

01:32:11.359 --> 01:32:13.777
No, the document
was leaked by e-mail.

01:32:13.903 --> 01:32:16.780
It's just, the fax machine was there,
and it's easier to kick.

01:32:16.906 --> 01:32:19.199
Come on, Thick White Duke!

01:32:19.325 --> 01:32:21.826
- Don't shout at...
- Come with me.

01:32:21.953 --> 01:32:24.788
Right, OK. Is it up? Have you got it up?

01:32:24.914 --> 01:32:26.456
Yeah, it's all fine.

01:32:26.582 --> 01:32:29.000
OK. Cut the top paragraph
and paste it into page 5.

01:32:29.126 --> 01:32:30.502
Right, yeah, we've done it.

01:32:30.628 --> 01:32:33.004
Page 6- get rid of the footnotes.

01:32:33.130 --> 01:32:34.256
Done.

01:32:34.382 --> 01:32:36.716
- Go to page 9.
- Go to page 9.

01:32:36.842 --> 01:32:39.678
Highlight from that page
to the end of the document.

01:32:39.804 --> 01:32:42.472
- Go on, do it.
- The caveats?

01:32:42.598 --> 01:32:45.183
- OK. Delete.
- Right, OK, we're doing it. Delete it.

01:32:45.309 --> 01:32:48.937
You can't delete
the arguments against the war.

01:32:49.063 --> 01:32:52.649
Oh. There's a shake of the head here,
Malc. I think he's crashed.

01:32:52.775 --> 01:32:54.442
Give him a thump - that usually works.

01:32:54.569 --> 01:32:56.528
Let me try
a wee bit of manual override.

01:32:56.654 --> 01:33:00.657
Let's see if it is possible to delete
the arguments against the war.

01:33:00.783 --> 01:33:03.535
Hey! You coulddelete it, after all.
It's done.

01:33:03.661 --> 01:33:05.662
Great. Now, attach that to an e-mail.

01:33:05.788 --> 01:33:07.289
Yes, done it. Done it.

01:33:07.415 --> 01:33:09.332
Let's find a printer.

01:33:09.458 --> 01:33:12.043
- Right.
- The Japanese. They'll have a printer.

01:33:13.045 --> 01:33:15.505
- Well, we can't just present it like this.
- No, we can't.

01:33:15.631 --> 01:33:17.757
Go and get me a blue folder.

01:33:17.883 --> 01:33:19.968
- Well, OK. Where from?
- I don't know.

01:33:20.094 --> 01:33:24.180
I've never been in a fucking stationery
cupboard. I do my shagging in hotels.

01:33:24.307 --> 01:33:26.349
Just take out all the conditionals.

01:33:26.475 --> 01:33:31.062
Like, "might" becomes... Instead of
"might have found", "have found". OK?

01:33:35.109 --> 01:33:37.902
Be audacious.
Just re-write the whole damn thing.

01:33:39.196 --> 01:33:40.196
Ohh...

01:33:40.323 --> 01:33:42.866
Declarative sentences -
that's what I want.

01:33:42.992 --> 01:33:44.868
- Take 'em all out.
- Linton, come here.

01:33:44.994 --> 01:33:47.746
- What is it?
- The intel your guys couldn't find.

01:33:47.872 --> 01:33:49.914
Yeah?

01:33:53.544 --> 01:33:58.131
I think that I am owed
a massive, grovelling apology.

01:33:58.257 --> 01:34:01.092
Congratulations, huh?

01:34:01.218 --> 01:34:03.261
Maybe they'll give you a knighthood.

01:34:04.263 --> 01:34:05.930
A pleasure doing business with you.

01:34:06.057 --> 01:34:08.933
You know,
I've come across a lot of psychos...

01:34:09.060 --> 01:34:12.312
but none as fucking boring as you.

01:34:12.438 --> 01:34:15.482
I mean, you are a real, boring fuck.

01:34:15.608 --> 01:34:18.943
- Sorry. I know you dislike swearing.
- No, that's all right.

01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:25.450
So, I'll sort that out.
You are a boring F star-star cunt.

01:34:29.038 --> 01:34:31.539
- Are we pretty much...
- Everything as you requested.

01:34:31.666 --> 01:34:34.084
Fine. Good. Ah, welcome aboard, Liza.

01:34:35.294 --> 01:34:37.754
I will make this brief and to the point.

01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:41.299
We're gonna go in,
we're going to state our case,

01:34:41.425 --> 01:34:44.844
with new British intelligence
from source Debussy,

01:34:44.970 --> 01:34:47.764
we win the argument,
we get the hell out. All right?

01:34:47.890 --> 01:34:51.976
Resolution 2238 is passed.

01:34:52.978 --> 01:34:55.313
Yeah. That's that, then.

01:34:56.357 --> 01:34:57.273
Yeah?

01:34:57.400 --> 01:35:00.443
Jolly good. "That's that, then,"
is your line for the ages, is it?

01:35:00.569 --> 01:35:01.945
What?

01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:05.615
Well, I remember,
the day that war was declared,

01:35:05.741 --> 01:35:08.618
I turned to the Minister, and he said...

01:35:08.744 --> 01:35:12.122
"That's that, then.
Anyone want a mint?"

01:35:12.248 --> 01:35:14.290
Piss off, Toby.

01:35:16.043 --> 01:35:19.170
- How long before British troops...
Well done, Michael.

01:35:19.296 --> 01:35:22.632
You did a really, really, really good job.

01:35:23.676 --> 01:35:25.635
Oh, for fuck's sake, don't cry.

01:35:28.180 --> 01:35:31.391
I e-mailed my resignation
five minutes ago.

01:35:31.517 --> 01:35:35.228
And yours should come pretty soon,
for the biggest media impact.

01:35:35.354 --> 01:35:37.063
- I've been thinking.
- Yeah?

01:35:38.691 --> 01:35:41.568
This has been the hardest
political decision of my career.

01:35:42.570 --> 01:35:44.904
I'm not going to resign.

01:35:45.030 --> 01:35:47.991
Huh! What the fuck, George?

01:35:48.117 --> 01:35:50.118
Before the war, I was going to resign,

01:35:50.244 --> 01:35:54.330
but now that there's a war on...
I can't resign.

01:35:54.457 --> 01:35:58.126
You said that this was intolerable.
You said we would go together.

01:35:58.252 --> 01:36:01.337
It is intolerable,
but I'm going to have to tolerate it.

01:36:01.464 --> 01:36:04.340
And I still agree with myself on that.

01:36:04.467 --> 01:36:07.010
But my loyalty is to the kids.
I am a soldier.

01:36:07.136 --> 01:36:09.095
You're not a soldier.

01:36:10.389 --> 01:36:12.640
- I've been a soldier my whole life.
- Yeah?

01:36:12.767 --> 01:36:15.018
What do you mean, I'm not a soldier?
I'm a soldier.

01:36:15.144 --> 01:36:17.854
Look at the uniform - you think
I'm one of the Village People?

01:36:17.980 --> 01:36:20.857
When did you shoot a guy last?

01:36:20.983 --> 01:36:23.693
Oh, not shooting someone in 15 years
means I'm not a soldier?

01:36:23.819 --> 01:36:26.905
You know, the Army doesn't make you
drag some bloody corpse

01:36:27.031 --> 01:36:30.450
into the Pentagon every five years,
to renew your "soldier's licence".

01:36:30.576 --> 01:36:34.662
It's unnecessary! And if you were
a good general, you'd have some balls!

01:36:34.789 --> 01:36:37.457
Look, shut up about my balls.
My balls have been around.

01:36:37.583 --> 01:36:39.959
You've got no idea
where my balls have been.

01:36:40.085 --> 01:36:43.046
I can talk about your balls all you want,
cos I remember when...

01:36:43.172 --> 01:36:46.424
Oh, I fucked you once 20 years ago,
and I never hear the end of it!

01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:50.553
Every time we're together, I hear
this shit. I don't even remember it!

01:36:50.679 --> 01:36:53.473
Come on, Chad. We have to draft
resignation announcements.

01:36:53.599 --> 01:36:56.768
Actually, I think I might stay
with the General, if that's OK.

01:36:56.894 --> 01:37:00.730
If he's staying, I might stay with him,
see what assistance I can furnish.

01:37:00.856 --> 01:37:04.400
OK... General Shrek
and his faithful, talking donkey.

01:37:04.527 --> 01:37:06.778
- That was nice.
- OK, well done.

01:37:06.904 --> 01:37:09.739
- What are you sticking around for?
- Well, to let you know

01:37:09.865 --> 01:37:11.908
that I think you've got...

01:37:12.952 --> 01:37:14.744
...big balls...

01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:19.082
- It's like... two-thirds of the snowman.
- Dear God.

01:37:21.001 --> 01:37:23.002
- We did it, Bob, huh?
- Yes, we did, sir.

01:37:23.128 --> 01:37:25.505
There were a few moments
where it got a little hairy.

01:37:25.631 --> 01:37:27.090
No, there weren't.

01:37:29.802 --> 01:37:31.886
No, no, no, Simon. No, no, listen.

01:37:32.012 --> 01:37:34.472
Hey, hey, hey.
Look, look, look. No, no, no.

01:37:37.643 --> 01:37:40.520
- You still don't need to resign.
- I do.

01:37:40.646 --> 01:37:42.522
I'm resigning in an hour,

01:37:42.648 --> 01:37:45.483
and there's nothing
you can do about it now.

01:37:45.609 --> 01:37:47.694
- Boss...
Yes?

01:37:47.820 --> 01:37:50.780
Erm...
it's all over the BBC News websites.

01:37:50.906 --> 01:37:54.117
Partial collapse of the wall.
Mrs Michaelson's greenhouse.

01:37:54.243 --> 01:37:55.994
Obviously, a pane's been smashed.

01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:58.496
The BBC
must have had a crew down there.

01:37:58.622 --> 01:38:00.999
God, how ridiculous!

01:38:01.125 --> 01:38:03.167
And that's news?

01:38:04.211 --> 01:38:06.170
It's not ridiculous.

01:38:06.297 --> 01:38:09.716
It's not ridiculous at all... You're fired.

01:38:10.801 --> 01:38:12.719
What?

01:38:12.845 --> 01:38:16.180
Over the wall -
I mean, that's just not tolerable.

01:38:16.307 --> 01:38:19.309
It's a fucking wall, Malcolm.

01:38:19.435 --> 01:38:21.185
Look. Give me the paper.

01:38:21.312 --> 01:38:25.607
The Telegraph has a cartoon of you
teetering on the Great Wall of China,

01:38:25.733 --> 01:38:28.818
suggesting you are the only
political fuck-up visible from space.

01:38:28.944 --> 01:38:31.404
Look at this. Look at it.

01:38:31.530 --> 01:38:33.573
No-one could survive this.

01:38:34.533 --> 01:38:38.161
The PM's very clear about this.
You're sacked - over the wall.

01:38:38.287 --> 01:38:40.371
- No.
- Yes!

01:38:40.497 --> 01:38:44.417
No. You-You-You haven't
even spoken to the Prime Minister.

01:38:44.543 --> 01:38:45.835
I- I-I have.

01:38:45.961 --> 01:38:48.671
You fucking haven't!
I've been here in front of you.

01:38:48.797 --> 01:38:52.884
I have spoken to the PM. Whether it
happenedor not is irrelevant. It is true.

01:38:53.010 --> 01:38:56.554
And he was very clear -
you've got to go.

01:38:59.183 --> 01:39:00.934
Ha!

01:39:02.770 --> 01:39:05.063
If you think I'm going quietly,
Malcolm...

01:39:06.899 --> 01:39:08.858
...you've... you've made a mistake.

01:39:08.984 --> 01:39:12.111
Well, if you want to turn this
into some anti-war protest,

01:39:12.237 --> 01:39:16.199
expect to hear your "mountain
of conflict" sound-bite everywhere.

01:39:16.325 --> 01:39:20.620
From ring-tones to fucking...
a dance mix on YouTube.

01:39:20.746 --> 01:39:25.833
And I will marshal
all the media forces of darkness,

01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:28.294
to hound you to an assisted suicide.

01:39:29.546 --> 01:39:33.049
Right-ho. Let's just go and draft your...
"Dear Prime Minster,

01:39:33.175 --> 01:39:37.011
Just a quick note to say,
'Thanks for giving me the sack,"' letter.

01:39:39.014 --> 01:39:41.140
Off we trot.

01:39:41.266 --> 01:39:43.309
Come on, young Simon.

01:39:54.488 --> 01:39:57.949
Erm... General Miller... sorry.
I know this is an awkward time to be...

01:39:58.075 --> 01:40:00.159
Go fuck yourself, Frodo.

01:40:00.285 --> 01:40:02.161
OK.

01:40:02.287 --> 01:40:04.455
You can fuck off yourself, then.

01:40:10.963 --> 01:40:14.132
- Are you hanging, Chad?
- Just... hanging.

01:40:14.258 --> 01:40:17.677
- Wanna play some Facebook chess?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:40:17.803 --> 01:40:20.179
Just get away from the wall!
What are you doing?

01:40:20.305 --> 01:40:21.931
I just want a photo near the wall.

01:40:22.057 --> 01:40:25.977
Yeah, you can go back
another 12 inches. No, a bit further.

01:40:26.103 --> 01:40:28.479
- There?
- Stop there!

01:40:28.605 --> 01:40:30.314
Check.

01:40:30.441 --> 01:40:32.400
I haven't touched it.

01:40:32.526 --> 01:40:36.487
I made a move for you, which is
the best move possible, and it's still...

01:40:36.613 --> 01:40:39.824
You might be Secretary
of State someday, young man.

01:40:40.701 --> 01:40:42.952
You... Don't say that
if you don't mean that.

01:40:43.078 --> 01:40:48.124
When, you know, all of this shit
is over, maybe, you know...

01:40:48.250 --> 01:40:51.627
You're a woman... I'm not a woman.

01:40:54.298 --> 01:40:56.257
You wanna have sex again?

01:40:57.342 --> 01:40:59.761
Well, would it be such a terrible idea?

01:40:59.887 --> 01:41:01.929
You know - one more.

01:41:02.056 --> 01:41:04.307
"One more for the Gipper. "

01:41:04.433 --> 01:41:07.310
Well, I don't want to be accused
of micro-managing,

01:41:07.436 --> 01:41:11.564
but I cannot understand
why "I Heart Huckabees"

01:41:11.690 --> 01:41:16.486
is on a list of DVDs considered suitable
for armed-forces entertainment.

01:41:16.612 --> 01:41:21.991
That self-indulgent crap
is not suitable for combat troops.

01:41:22.117 --> 01:41:25.536
I've got a selection of the quotations
here for you.

01:41:25.662 --> 01:41:29.040
I mean, they're all local building firms.
Much of a muchness.

01:41:29.166 --> 01:41:31.459
You know,
to sort out the boundary wall.

01:41:31.585 --> 01:41:34.712
But the... this septic tank...

01:41:34.838 --> 01:41:37.590
That is rearing its pooey head again.

01:41:37.716 --> 01:41:38.549
Yes.

01:41:38.675 --> 01:41:42.470
I just got off the phone with Linton,
who proceeded to bitch me out,

01:41:42.596 --> 01:41:46.390
for allowing "I Heart Huckabees"
on the troops' DVD roster.

01:41:46.517 --> 01:41:49.852
Yeah. You know that phrase,
"I'm too old for this shit"?

01:41:49.978 --> 01:41:52.230
Well, I'm too young for this shit.
You know?

01:41:52.356 --> 01:41:55.525
Here's the new Minister.
- Malcolm!

01:41:55.651 --> 01:41:57.568
- There she is.
- Ladies and gentlemen.

01:41:57.694 --> 01:42:00.530
- Look at you!
- Thank you. Thank you. How touching.

01:42:00.656 --> 01:42:03.157
- Minister, how are you doing?
- Very well indeed.

01:42:03.283 --> 01:42:06.035
- You've lost some weight.
- Hello. Judy Molloy.

01:42:06.161 --> 01:42:10.164
- Nice to meet you. This is Dan.
- Danny. Dan. Special Advisor.

01:42:10.290 --> 01:42:12.625
- Danny Dan?
- War seems to be going great guns.

01:42:12.751 --> 01:42:16.170
- Oh, very cheeky! Very cheeky.
- Judy, have I got a desk out here?

01:42:16.296 --> 01:42:19.882
- Careful. There's blood on the deck.
- Er... yeah, sure. You can use that one.

01:42:20.008 --> 01:42:23.803
How about this? You can't
get better than this. Very glamorous.

01:42:23.929 --> 01:42:26.889
It's a side-step
from my previous job, but that's fine.

01:42:27.015 --> 01:42:29.517
I think there's a wee bit of brains there.

01:42:29.643 --> 01:42:31.602
It's the only brains that he had, actually.

01:42:31.728 --> 01:42:34.063
Nice to meet you, Dan.
Where did you go to school?

01:42:34.189 --> 01:42:37.316
- Erm... just a school in Jersey.
- In Jersey?

01:42:37.442 --> 01:42:39.193
- Is that actually Britain?
- Yeah.

01:42:39.319 --> 01:42:43.072
I'm sorry, but I've been
standing here for 20 minutes...

01:45:24.818 --> 01:45:26.777
Let's see you.

01:45:26.903 --> 01:45:31.782
Look at the hair on this. Who let this
woman out with fucking hair like this,

01:45:31.908 --> 01:45:34.076
on national television?

01:45:34.202 --> 01:45:37.955
You'd think she's got her finger
stuck in a fucking electric socket.

01:45:38.081 --> 01:45:39.790
Unbelievable.
