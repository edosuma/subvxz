01:23.198 --> 01:24.499
I hate surprises.

01:24.566 --> 01:26.000
Yeah?
Yes.

01:26.067 --> 01:28.002
You didn't mind when I surprised
you with my promotion.

01:28.069 --> 01:30.710
Well, that wasn't a surprise, that
was earned by my genius husband.

01:30.773 --> 01:32.056
Good answer by my genius wife.

01:32.123 --> 01:34.058
See, I thought you only
liked me for my body.

01:34.126 --> 01:36.361
I do like you for your body.

01:36.429 --> 01:38.129
What are we doing?

01:40.166 --> 01:41.449
Surprise.

01:44.537 --> 01:46.821
I don't understand.
What is it?

01:46.888 --> 01:48.923
It's a house.
Yes.

01:48.991 --> 01:51.859
Yes, I can see that.
Thank you.

01:51.927 --> 01:55.213
Also known as a home,
sanctuary, dwelling.

01:55.280 --> 01:57.448
Yeah?

01:57.516 --> 02:00.118
Or, if you like,
you could just call it ours.

02:01.453 --> 02:03.404
Ours?
Mmm-hmm.

02:04.856 --> 02:05.907
Where would we get the money?

02:05.975 --> 02:08.743
I mean, how do we get
into something like this?

02:08.811 --> 02:10.443
Oh, I don't know.

02:12.547 --> 02:14.515
Maybe with a key.

02:17.820 --> 02:20.855
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, are you kidding?

02:24.927 --> 02:26.728
It's a classic.

02:26.795 --> 02:28.713
1920s, wood-frame.

02:28.780 --> 02:30.865
Three bedroom,
one-and-a-half bath.

02:30.933 --> 02:33.818
And the old owners even left us
a brand-new swing set out back.

02:33.886 --> 02:36.371
Oh, well, I think I'm a
little big for swing sets.

02:36.438 --> 02:39.374
We have to fill up those spare
rooms sometime soon, right?

02:39.441 --> 02:40.841
Thank you.

02:48.734 --> 02:51.419
I love you.
I love you, too.

02:51.487 --> 02:52.987
Let's go home.

03:15.377 --> 03:16.544
Mommy?

03:18.597 --> 03:20.181
Mommy?
Hmm.

03:20.248 --> 03:22.383
When's Daddy coming home?

03:22.451 --> 03:23.617
What, baby?

03:23.685 --> 03:25.686
When's Daddy coming home?

03:25.754 --> 03:26.754
Um...

03:28.891 --> 03:31.792
Today, baby. It was just
an overnight trip.

03:32.694 --> 03:34.295
Why couldn't he take us?

03:34.363 --> 03:36.965
Because it was work
and we couldn't go.

03:37.032 --> 03:39.049
But how about a,
"Good morning, Mommy.

03:39.117 --> 03:40.768
"Nice to see you."
Good morning, Mommy.

03:40.903 --> 03:42.470
Mom, you gotta get dressed.

03:42.621 --> 03:45.690
Sweetie, we got plenty of time.

03:45.758 --> 03:48.443
We're gonna be late for school.
Oh, no.

03:48.510 --> 03:50.961
We're not gonna be
late for school.

03:51.029 --> 03:53.781
Better get going
or we'll be late for school.

04:04.192 --> 04:05.660
Bridgette, are you okay
with your spelling words?

04:05.728 --> 04:06.927
Yes, Mom.

04:06.995 --> 04:08.863
Hey, hey, hey,
don't forget your lunches.

04:08.931 --> 04:12.267
You got it? Here. Got it?
Give me a kiss. Bye. Bye.

04:12.334 --> 04:14.335
Come on, Megan.
I am!

05:49.932 --> 05:51.432
This isn't dirty.

06:23.364 --> 06:25.066
<i>Hey, girl, what's going on?</i>

06:25.133 --> 06:27.234
<i>I can't believe</i>
<i>it's Thursday already.</i>

06:27.302 --> 06:30.121
Tell me about it.
I have no idea where this week went.

06:30.189 --> 06:32.022
God, I wish you were here.

06:32.090 --> 06:35.293
I am having the hardest time trying
to pick out my dress for tonight.

06:35.360 --> 06:37.561
What about you guys?
You have any big plans for the weekend?

06:37.629 --> 06:39.980
What, besides jetting off
to Acapulco? No.

06:40.048 --> 06:43.150
Yeah, right.
Okay, I gotta go.

06:43.218 --> 06:45.720
I gotta figure out what I'm
doing with my life right now.

06:45.787 --> 06:47.755
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>
<i>What's his name?</i>

06:47.822 --> 06:50.675
His name? Well, the name
is really bad. It's Harry.

06:50.742 --> 06:52.977
<i>But, you never know,</i>
<i>he could be the one.</i>

06:53.045 --> 06:54.112
Bye.

06:58.350 --> 07:00.752
<i>You have one new message.</i>

07:00.819 --> 07:02.319
<i>First new message.</i>

07:02.387 --> 07:06.323
<i>Linda, listen, I need</i>
<i>to tell you something.</i>

07:08.193 --> 07:11.963
<i>I meant what I said in front of
the girls the other night, and...</i>

07:13.999 --> 07:15.099
<i>I just...</i>

07:17.118 --> 07:19.303
<i>I just want you to know that</i>

07:20.739 --> 07:23.307
<i>and to please remember it.</i>

07:23.375 --> 07:25.877
<i>Damn it.</i>
<i>Someone's calling. Hold on.</i>

07:26.979 --> 07:28.379
<i>Is that you?</i>

07:29.381 --> 07:30.915
<i>End of messages.</i>

07:34.953 --> 07:38.923
<i>If you leave a message, I'll get
back to you as soon as possible.</i>

07:38.990 --> 07:41.892
Hey, it's me.
I got your message.

07:41.960 --> 07:44.862
I don't know when you left it,

07:44.930 --> 07:47.464
but just call me
when you get mine.

07:47.532 --> 07:49.566
Okay? Bye.

08:17.145 --> 08:18.595
Mrs. Hanson?

08:18.663 --> 08:19.764
Yes?

08:19.831 --> 08:21.499
Linda Hanson?

08:22.000 --> 08:23.534
Uh-huh.

08:23.601 --> 08:26.304
I'm Sheriff Reilly.
Yes?

08:27.672 --> 08:30.190
I'm sorry to tell you this.

08:31.559 --> 08:34.227
Your husband, Jim...
Yeah?

08:34.296 --> 08:35.663
was in a car accident.

08:38.783 --> 08:40.517
He died on the scene.

08:51.529 --> 08:53.764
When?
Yesterday.

08:53.832 --> 08:57.668
No. No, it's impossible
because I just...

08:57.735 --> 09:01.172
I just heard his voice on the
answering machine, so...

09:02.975 --> 09:05.742
Well, I'm sorry, ma'am.

09:05.810 --> 09:08.879
We couldn't get to you
any sooner.

09:11.633 --> 09:15.269
The other driver
was in a truck. A semi.

09:15.337 --> 09:17.971
They're certain
it was instantaneous.

09:18.039 --> 09:19.740
It jackknifed. 220.

09:19.808 --> 09:23.110
He was on the highway,
around mile marker 220.

09:23.178 --> 09:25.813
The truck driver
was killed as well.

09:25.880 --> 09:28.583
I'm very sorry
about your husband.

09:28.650 --> 09:31.219
Ma'am is there anything
that I can do?

09:31.286 --> 09:36.107
Ma'am? Mrs. Hanson? Ma'am?

09:36.174 --> 09:38.859
Ma'am, is there anything
that I can do?

09:40.228 --> 09:42.612
Can I call someone for you?
Mmm-mmm.

09:49.070 --> 09:51.805
Let me leave you
my card. Okay?

09:51.873 --> 09:54.591
If you have any questions,
you just call me.

11:10.202 --> 11:11.969
What's wrong, Mommy?

11:18.393 --> 11:19.593
Mommy?

11:21.997 --> 11:23.631
What's wrong?

11:36.077 --> 11:38.128
It's about Daddy.

11:38.196 --> 11:40.430
Yeah?
Yeah.

11:43.634 --> 11:45.536
He's had a very bad accident.

11:46.854 --> 11:48.722
What kind of accident?

11:51.142 --> 11:53.110
When is he coming home?

11:55.513 --> 11:56.914
Is he okay?

11:59.617 --> 12:01.384
No, baby, he's not.

12:04.689 --> 12:06.023
Come here.

12:23.959 --> 12:26.927
Wow, I'm impressed.

12:26.995 --> 12:29.813
You guys got this far
all by yourself?

12:29.881 --> 12:31.632
Yeah.

12:31.700 --> 12:33.717
That's really amazing.

12:39.090 --> 12:39.710
<i>Hey, it's Annie.</i>

12:39.736 --> 12:40.857
<i>Leave a message at the beep,</i>

12:40.858 --> 12:43.093
<i>and I promise</i>
<i>I'll get right back to you.</i>

12:44.562 --> 12:46.330
Hey, Annie. It's me.

12:48.833 --> 12:51.902
Could you please call me as
soon as you get this message?

12:51.969 --> 12:53.303
Thank you.

12:56.341 --> 13:00.311
Wow, you girls
are doing so great.

13:01.679 --> 13:04.048
Daddy's better
at puzzles.

13:04.116 --> 13:06.083
He was going to help us.

13:30.976 --> 13:33.360
Hi, honey.
Hey.

13:34.395 --> 13:36.930
I think I finally
got them to sleep.

13:39.333 --> 13:40.701
Oh, I should say good night.

13:40.768 --> 13:43.303
No, don't do that.
They just fell asleep. Leave it.

13:43.371 --> 13:44.605
Okay.

13:46.440 --> 13:50.577
I was thinking about everything
we need to get done.

13:50.645 --> 13:56.316
Tomorrow we should probably start
looking into funeral arrangements.

13:56.384 --> 14:01.087
And then, you know, just see where
you are in terms of insurance.

14:01.155 --> 14:03.824
I'm not ready for that, Mom.

14:03.909 --> 14:07.043
Nobody's ready
for any of this, dear.

14:07.111 --> 14:10.464
But you'll be surprised
at how strong you're gonna be.

14:10.532 --> 14:12.682
You know when I lost your dad...
I can't stop thinking

14:12.751 --> 14:15.653
about our serving platter.

14:15.720 --> 14:19.239
What serving platter?
You know, the big one on the top shelf,

14:19.307 --> 14:21.641
the one that his folks gave us.

14:23.311 --> 14:25.545
I can't reach that.

14:25.613 --> 14:27.748
Jim... Jim does that
for me.

14:31.536 --> 14:35.773
Well, nobody expects you to get everything
done in the first few days, dear.

14:37.842 --> 14:39.909
I... I'm pretty tired.

14:39.977 --> 14:42.479
I'm gonna go lie down in the den.
Okay.

14:42.547 --> 14:46.500
I'll get some sheets
out of the closet.

14:46.568 --> 14:49.002
I'll be right up here
if you need me, dear.

17:06.641 --> 17:07.656
Mom?

17:10.611 --> 17:11.627
Mom?

18:28.956 --> 18:30.090
Jim?

18:36.364 --> 18:37.865
What's wrong?

18:44.789 --> 18:46.206
I don't... I don't know.

18:46.274 --> 18:48.475
I just had...
I just had the...

18:50.928 --> 18:53.096
I just had the strangest...

18:54.182 --> 18:55.999
What? What is it?

18:57.902 --> 19:01.037
Okay. I guess it's nothing.
It's nothing, it's nothing.

19:05.593 --> 19:08.879
Mom, we're late.
Three times and we get detention.

19:08.947 --> 19:10.513
And how is that a good
way to start the day?

19:10.582 --> 19:12.466
How about,
"Good morning, Mommy."

19:12.468 --> 19:14.050
Good morning.
"Good to see you, Mommy."

19:14.118 --> 19:15.535
Good morning.

19:15.603 --> 19:18.522
All right. I gotta get going.
Monday morning meeting.

19:20.358 --> 19:23.093
I got hugs for everybody.
All right, I gotta get going.

19:23.160 --> 19:26.230
I gotta train
this new assistant manager.

19:28.599 --> 19:31.751
I packed their lunches.
Ready to go.

19:31.819 --> 19:34.354
Are you okay
to take them to school?

19:35.956 --> 19:37.307
Mmm-hmm.

19:39.093 --> 19:41.561
Okay.

19:41.629 --> 19:44.130
You girls have fun at school now.
Bye-bye, Daddy.

19:44.198 --> 19:45.765
See you, honey.

20:04.001 --> 20:06.483
You okay with your
spelling words, Bridge?

20:06.509 --> 20:07.128
Yes.

20:07.171 --> 20:09.339
Hey, you guys,
don't forget your lunch.

20:12.927 --> 20:14.628
Come on, Megan,
get out of the car.

20:14.695 --> 20:15.879
I'm coming.

20:42.891 --> 20:45.392
<i>You have no messages.</i>

20:58.756 --> 20:59.873
Oh!

21:03.828 --> 21:05.395
Oh, shit.

21:14.104 --> 21:15.605
That was
quite a stop there.

21:15.673 --> 21:17.774
Yeah, I just...
I was totally...

21:19.660 --> 21:21.628
Yeah, I just, I got comp...

21:23.247 --> 21:24.414
Um...

21:24.481 --> 21:27.617
I just, I was totally
just distracted.

21:27.685 --> 21:30.086
Let's just take it
a little easy out there, huh?

21:30.154 --> 21:31.388
Sure.

21:31.455 --> 21:33.590
We don't want anyone
getting hurt now, do we?

21:35.910 --> 21:37.728
I'm trying to figure
out, should I call him?

21:37.795 --> 21:40.595
I mean, I really feel like I wanna
call him, but then it's kind of like

21:40.631 --> 21:41.998
I think that's
breaking the rules.

21:42.066 --> 21:44.535
I think it's better
if I just wait.

21:45.803 --> 21:47.154
What?

21:48.305 --> 21:50.540
Did we talk yesterday?

21:50.608 --> 21:51.958
Yeah. We talk every day.

21:52.026 --> 21:55.395
No, I mean, did I
leave you a message?

21:57.398 --> 22:00.266
I don't think so. Why?

22:00.334 --> 22:03.387
Wait a minute, hang on. I'm the one
with the crisis, okay? Are you...

22:03.389 --> 22:06.089
Are you sure you're all right?
Yeah.

22:06.156 --> 22:08.358
Everything's cool
with you and Jim?

22:10.044 --> 22:12.746
Yeah. Everything's
exactly the same.

23:23.835 --> 23:25.118
Oh, God.

24:12.884 --> 24:15.134
So, how was everybody's day?

24:17.872 --> 24:19.405
It was okay.

24:19.474 --> 24:21.575
Kind of boring.
Thank you.

24:21.642 --> 24:23.677
Yeah, kind of boring.

24:27.147 --> 24:29.332
Boring, huh?
Yeah.

25:43.707 --> 25:44.808
Jim?

26:09.083 --> 26:10.317
Jim.

26:10.968 --> 26:12.118
Jim.

26:19.209 --> 26:20.726
What the...

26:22.263 --> 26:23.446
Lithium?

26:26.133 --> 26:27.417
I...

26:44.318 --> 26:46.452
Thanks for coming.

26:46.520 --> 26:48.171
Here's your coffee.

26:49.356 --> 26:51.507
You never know.
Here she is.

26:51.575 --> 26:53.210
Hi, honey.

26:54.378 --> 26:55.845
Did you get
some rest?

26:55.913 --> 26:57.113
What's going on?

26:57.181 --> 26:58.731
Hey, how you feeling?

26:58.799 --> 27:00.733
Why don't you go upstairs
and let's get some clothes on.

27:00.801 --> 27:02.135
You wanna go upstairs
and get dressed?

27:02.202 --> 27:05.054
Where are the girls?
The girls are fine, dear.

27:05.122 --> 27:07.223
The girls are fine, honey.
Don't worry about the girls.

27:07.291 --> 27:08.575
This isn't right.

27:08.577 --> 27:10.060
What isn't, sweetie?
No, everything's fine.

27:10.127 --> 27:11.944
Do you need to go upstairs
and get more sleep? Or...

27:12.012 --> 27:14.664
No, no, no, I don't need
any more sleep,

27:14.732 --> 27:16.299
and I don't need
to wake up, either.

27:16.367 --> 27:17.967
Everything's
gonna be fine.

27:17.969 --> 27:20.436
No, Mother, everything is not fine!
Okay.

27:20.504 --> 27:23.856
Something is really, really wrong.
Okay.

27:23.924 --> 27:25.408
I'm...

27:26.610 --> 27:28.144
He's not dead.

27:40.124 --> 27:41.591
Hi, baby.

27:41.942 --> 27:43.293
Hey.

27:44.028 --> 27:45.611
Hi.

27:45.679 --> 27:48.214
Sorry I wasn't awake
when you guys got up.

27:48.281 --> 27:50.149
Grandma said we had to
let you sleep.

27:50.217 --> 27:52.885
No, baby. You can always
wake me up.

27:54.988 --> 27:56.839
What's your sister doing?

27:56.907 --> 27:59.141
Swinging.
Yeah?

27:59.209 --> 28:02.144
I think she's sad.
Yeah.

28:02.212 --> 28:04.430
We're all a little sad
right now.

28:13.273 --> 28:14.357
Hi, baby.

28:24.501 --> 28:25.951
Oh, my God.

28:26.620 --> 28:28.371
Oh, my God, baby.

28:28.439 --> 28:31.056
Baby, what happened
to your face?

28:31.942 --> 28:33.243
Baby, talk to me.

28:33.310 --> 28:35.245
How did you get these cuts?
Who did this to you, baby?

28:35.312 --> 28:37.697
Did what?
The cuts! The cuts on your face.

28:37.765 --> 28:39.065
There's no cuts, Mommy.

28:39.132 --> 28:41.117
What are you talking about?

28:41.185 --> 28:45.054
She's perfect,
like a beautiful princess.

28:51.411 --> 28:54.447
Oh, God, come here. Come here.
Just hold onto me.

28:54.514 --> 28:57.784
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay. Come here.

28:57.851 --> 28:59.986
It's gonna be all right.
Everything's gonna be all right.

29:00.054 --> 29:02.021
Everything's gonna be
all right.

29:02.089 --> 29:04.190
Mommy?
Yeah?

29:04.341 --> 29:06.876
What was it like
when Daddy died?

29:08.362 --> 29:11.431
I don't know, baby.
I wasn't there.

29:11.498 --> 29:14.116
So how did you know
he died then?

29:48.819 --> 29:50.369
Are you all right?

29:51.621 --> 29:54.206
What if this is a mistake?

29:54.358 --> 29:56.159
What do you mean, "a mistake"?

29:56.227 --> 29:58.661
People just don't die one day and
are okay the next day, that's all.

29:58.729 --> 30:00.563
It's not a mistake. Jim's...

30:00.630 --> 30:02.415
Okay, Mom, did you see
inside the casket?

30:02.483 --> 30:04.316
No, I didn't see, dear,
but it doesn't...

30:04.384 --> 30:06.302
Okay, well something is seriously
fucked up with this situation.

30:06.369 --> 30:08.489
Linda? We need to go in the church now.
Come on, dear.

30:08.538 --> 30:10.473
No, you need
to take the kids inside.

30:10.541 --> 30:12.442
Well, why don't you come inside with us?
Just take the kids inside.

30:12.510 --> 30:14.810
Go ahead, go ahead
with the kids. Linda.

30:14.812 --> 30:15.828
Linda?

30:21.018 --> 30:22.519
Here she is.

30:24.755 --> 30:26.389
Hello, Mrs. Hanson.

30:26.540 --> 30:28.808
I just want you to know
that everything's on schedule.

30:28.876 --> 30:30.316
I need for you
to open up the casket.

30:30.327 --> 30:33.095
No, no, I don't think that
would be a very good idea.

30:33.163 --> 30:34.897
Open up the casket,
God damn it.

30:34.965 --> 30:36.482
Open it up! Open it up!

30:36.550 --> 30:38.468
Open it! Open it! Open it!
Mrs. Hanson!

30:38.535 --> 30:40.553
What?
I beg you to let this go.

30:40.621 --> 30:42.872
Don't do this to me.
Mrs. Hanson, I have to warn you.

30:42.874 --> 30:44.874
There was a problem with the body.
What kind of problem?

30:45.025 --> 30:47.760
They didn't want to tell you the way
he died. They didn't want to tell you.

30:47.828 --> 30:48.878
What about
the way that he died?

30:48.945 --> 30:50.413
There was a deep cut,
a severing.

30:50.481 --> 30:52.915
What kind of severing?
Well, it...

30:52.983 --> 30:55.234
Oh, my God.
No! No!

30:57.871 --> 31:01.357
Get out of the way!
Stop it! Let go of me!

31:01.425 --> 31:04.076
Let go! Let go of me!

31:04.144 --> 31:05.561
No!

31:05.629 --> 31:06.896
No!

31:07.430 --> 31:08.831
No!

31:17.324 --> 31:20.110
Jim left this world
a beloved person.

31:22.012 --> 31:24.947
His friends spoke
about his kindness,

31:25.015 --> 31:26.382
his laugh,

31:27.251 --> 31:29.785
his graciousness,

31:29.853 --> 31:34.157
his helpfulness and consideration
to everyone around him.

31:36.627 --> 31:40.263
But his greatest devotion
was to his family.

31:41.865 --> 31:44.483
His "girls" as he liked
to refer to them.

31:45.152 --> 31:47.854
His lovely wife, Linda.

31:47.921 --> 31:50.406
His precious daughters,
Megan and Bridgette.

31:50.474 --> 31:51.808
Mom?

31:51.876 --> 31:53.843
What?

31:53.911 --> 31:54.440
Who is that?

31:54.466 --> 31:56.538
And what better tribute
is there to any man.

31:56.580 --> 31:58.080
Who?
Her, that woman.

31:58.148 --> 32:01.317
Than the reflection
of his own love in the hearts

32:01.385 --> 32:04.120
of the loved ones he left behind.
I don't know, dear.

32:05.355 --> 32:08.207
And so, dear friends...
Linda?

32:08.275 --> 32:10.876
It's okay. It's okay.
...let us pray.

32:15.499 --> 32:20.603
"Our Father, who art in
heaven, hallowed be Thy name.

32:20.671 --> 32:25.974
"Thy kingdom come, Thy will be
done on earth as it is in heaven."

32:30.481 --> 32:33.499
Wait. No, please,
wait. Wait.

32:34.851 --> 32:36.869
I'm sorry.
Stop.

32:36.936 --> 32:38.654
How do you know my husband?

32:38.722 --> 32:40.006
I just thought that
after we talked and...

32:40.074 --> 32:42.325
We talked?
Well, yeah, yesterday when...

32:42.393 --> 32:43.859
Yesterday, I...

32:43.927 --> 32:45.544
You don't remember?
No.

32:45.613 --> 32:47.713
I've never met you before
in my life!

32:47.781 --> 32:49.515
I'm just gonna go, okay?
Please, talk to me.

32:49.583 --> 32:51.133
You have all my sympathies,
and your girls, too.

32:51.201 --> 32:53.552
Who are you?
Please. Don't just...

33:20.947 --> 33:22.632
"Lithium carbonate.
Take two tablets.

33:22.699 --> 33:24.567
"No refills remaining.

33:24.634 --> 33:26.836
"Dr. Norman Roth.
Do not take with alcohol.

33:26.903 --> 33:28.437
"Drowsiness and..."

33:30.273 --> 33:31.908
"Dr. Norman Roth."

33:32.592 --> 33:34.143
Dr. Norman Roth.

33:36.212 --> 33:37.379
Mommy?

33:46.323 --> 33:49.408
Hey, why don't you guys go downstairs
and visit with Grandma and Aunt Annie?

33:49.476 --> 33:50.593
No.

33:51.562 --> 33:53.362
I'm sure it'd be fun.

33:53.430 --> 33:55.948
What are you
looking for, Mommy?

33:56.016 --> 33:58.467
Mommy needs someone
to talk to, baby.

33:58.535 --> 34:00.219
Why don't you talk to us?

34:00.286 --> 34:02.955
Baby, I love talking to you,
but this is grown-up talk,

34:03.023 --> 34:05.457
and Mommy needs
some help, okay?

34:05.526 --> 34:08.761
Come on, baby,
please go downstairs.

34:08.829 --> 34:11.130
Thank you, baby.
Thank you for being so good.

34:11.197 --> 34:13.047
All right. Physicians.

34:52.522 --> 34:54.072
Dr. Roth.

35:03.333 --> 35:05.034
<i>You've reached
the offices of Dr. Norman Roth.</i>

35:05.102 --> 35:07.286
<i>We are currently closed.</i>

35:07.354 --> 35:12.041
<i>Our office hours are Monday through
Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.</i>

35:12.108 --> 35:15.978
<i>If this is an emergency,</i>
<i>please hang up and dial 911.</i>

35:30.661 --> 35:33.912
Do you guys want some tea
or coffee or anything?

35:33.980 --> 35:35.648
Can I get you something?

35:39.519 --> 35:42.554
Maybe we ought to think about
getting the girls to sleep, huh?

35:42.622 --> 35:45.224
Oh, yeah.
Been a long couple of days.

35:46.093 --> 35:48.110
Yes, it has.

35:48.177 --> 35:50.662
All right, girls.
Come on with Auntie Annie.

35:50.730 --> 35:53.382
We're gonna go upstairs and we'll
get your jammies on, okay?

35:53.450 --> 35:55.250
Then I'll read you a story?

35:56.369 --> 35:57.636
Yeah?

35:59.489 --> 36:01.449
Make sure you brush your teeth.

36:12.619 --> 36:13.970
Come in.

36:15.005 --> 36:16.788
Good evening, Mrs. King.

36:17.758 --> 36:19.324
Hi there, Annie.

36:23.113 --> 36:24.496
Hello, Linda.

36:26.466 --> 36:27.716
Hello.

36:31.405 --> 36:33.406
I'm Dr. Roth, remember?

36:35.926 --> 36:37.543
No, I don't. I...

36:50.574 --> 36:52.241
Annie.

36:52.309 --> 36:53.992
Okay, girls, let's go upstairs.
Mom?

36:54.060 --> 36:55.277
What's going on?

36:55.345 --> 36:57.746
Let's say good night to Mom.
And get our jammies on.

36:57.748 --> 36:59.999
Honey, please don't be angry.
No!

37:00.067 --> 37:02.384
Please. Please don't be angry with us.
Mommy!

37:02.452 --> 37:05.555
Wait a second. Annie.
Annie, what are you doing? Annie!

37:05.622 --> 37:08.273
Linda, your family
is worried about you.

37:08.341 --> 37:11.193
Your family cares about you, about
your situation, about the girls.

37:11.261 --> 37:13.016
What are you doing?
Mom, what are you doing?

37:13.042 --> 37:13.587
Annie. Annie.

37:13.630 --> 37:15.665
Honey, what else could we do?
What?

37:15.732 --> 37:18.300
Just tell us what happened
to Bridgette's face.

37:18.367 --> 37:20.502
Mom, I don't know what
happened to Bridgette's face.

37:20.570 --> 37:22.021
Don't you see?
That's what I mean.

37:22.088 --> 37:25.174
Mom, I would never do anything
to harm my child!

37:25.242 --> 37:26.742
For the girls' sake.
Get away from me!

37:26.810 --> 37:28.544
Baby, it's okay. God damn it!

37:28.612 --> 37:30.246
I didn't do this.
I didn't do this!

37:30.314 --> 37:32.197
Linda, stop it!
Get off of me!

37:32.265 --> 37:34.483
No, you can't do this to me!
What are you doing?

37:34.550 --> 37:37.103
Baby, it's okay, baby!
Mommy's all right!

37:37.170 --> 37:39.171
No, no, baby! No, no!
It's okay, baby! It's okay!

37:39.239 --> 37:41.106
God, look at what you're doing!

37:41.174 --> 37:42.107
Stop it!

37:42.175 --> 37:44.726
No, it's okay, baby!
Mommy's sorry!

37:44.794 --> 37:46.428
Mommy's very sorry!

37:46.496 --> 37:48.430
Stop! Stop it!

37:48.498 --> 37:52.051
Mom! Mom! Stop it!

37:53.437 --> 37:55.237
I'm sorry.

38:09.836 --> 38:11.570
Sir! Sir! Sir!

38:19.212 --> 38:22.982
Obviously, she's never
been committed before.

38:23.049 --> 38:26.602
The husband was in a
fatal car crash on Wednesday.

38:26.670 --> 38:28.971
I told her about it
on Thursday.

38:29.039 --> 38:31.023
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.

38:31.975 --> 38:33.308
Wednesday?

38:34.311 --> 38:35.561
That's strange.

38:35.628 --> 38:40.115
She showed up
in my office on Tuesday

38:40.183 --> 38:44.269
claiming he was already dead
or was gonna be.

38:44.288 --> 38:46.305
She said he was gonna die
before the accident?

38:46.373 --> 38:47.756
Yeah.

38:49.358 --> 38:51.777
Are you sure
it was an accident?

39:12.632 --> 39:14.049
Hello, Linda.

39:15.818 --> 39:18.353
Please don't do this.
I just wanna go home to my girls.

39:18.422 --> 39:20.856
Please don't do this.

39:20.924 --> 39:22.491
Please, just let me
go home to my girls.

39:22.558 --> 39:23.346
Please don't do this.

39:23.372 --> 39:25.135
We'll have time to talk
about that tomorrow.

39:25.178 --> 39:27.963
Please, don't do this. Please,
please don't do this. Please.

39:28.031 --> 39:30.800
Please don't. Don't do this.

39:42.228 --> 39:45.664
Everything is gonna be
just fine.

41:30.654 --> 41:31.720
Jim?

41:35.575 --> 41:36.709
What?

41:45.602 --> 41:46.685
You're okay?
Come on, Linda,

41:46.752 --> 41:48.153
you're gonna get
yourself soaked.

41:48.221 --> 41:50.555
Just give me a minute.
Just one more minute.

41:53.226 --> 41:56.495
I can hear your heart beating
and it feels so good.

41:59.816 --> 42:02.434
Hold on. Hey, hey,
hey. Hold on.

42:02.502 --> 42:04.637
Everything's gonna be fine.

42:04.704 --> 42:06.205
Come on.

42:06.272 --> 42:09.858
You promise?
I promise. I promise.

42:12.662 --> 42:15.780
What is it, honey?
Tell me what's going on.

42:15.932 --> 42:18.467
I don't even know
how to explain it.

42:45.428 --> 42:48.046
I gotta get going. I gotta get to work.
Just give me a minute.

42:48.114 --> 42:49.614
Just one more minute.

42:49.682 --> 42:53.419
I gotta... No, I gotta go.
I'm running late for work. I gotta go.

43:16.176 --> 43:17.258
Girls?

43:20.280 --> 43:22.114
Morning, Mommy.
Good morning.

43:22.181 --> 43:24.149
Good morning, Mommy.
Hi.

43:29.506 --> 43:30.572
Hey.

43:32.759 --> 43:33.993
Hi.

43:35.061 --> 43:36.745
Oh.

43:36.813 --> 43:39.915
Oh, you're so beautiful.
Do you know that?

43:39.982 --> 43:43.302
You are. You're so beautiful.
You're both beautiful.

43:44.204 --> 43:45.304
Oh.

43:55.866 --> 43:57.299
All right, babies,
listen to me.

43:57.367 --> 43:59.968
I need for you to be very,
very careful today, okay?

44:00.036 --> 44:02.538
No playing at recess.
I don't want you running around, okay?

44:02.605 --> 44:04.573
Ma'am, you're holding up the line.
Sit quietly, promise me.

44:04.641 --> 44:06.775
Ma'am.
Okay? Just give me a second!

44:06.843 --> 44:08.827
Just promise me. Promise?
I promise.

44:08.895 --> 44:10.895
Okay, baby. You gotta promise
me, too, okay, honey?

44:10.897 --> 44:13.499
All right.
Good girl. Okay. Here you go.

44:13.566 --> 44:14.966
You guys be good.

44:17.570 --> 44:18.954
Ma'am, come on. Please.

46:02.125 --> 46:05.077
You've got Mrs. Lynne at 3:00 and
then you're free until 5:00.

46:05.144 --> 46:06.311
Yeah, that's right. I...

46:06.379 --> 46:07.479
Keep that open for me.
Okay.

46:07.547 --> 46:09.114
Who's this?
Mrs. Stevenson.

46:09.182 --> 46:10.615
Mrs. Steven...

46:12.751 --> 46:15.187
Can I help you?
I'm Linda Hanson.

46:16.556 --> 46:18.990
Hello, Linda.
I'm Dr. Roth.

46:22.077 --> 46:23.728
Do you know me?

46:25.064 --> 46:27.499
Should I?

46:27.567 --> 46:31.920
I wake up and he's dead.
I wake up and he's alive.

46:31.988 --> 46:35.624
Different things around me all
the time that I can't explain.

46:35.692 --> 46:38.594
Things that I've done.

46:38.661 --> 46:43.031
People talking to me. People who
know me but I have never met.

46:43.099 --> 46:45.234
People like me.
Yes.

46:45.301 --> 46:47.168
Seems a little complicated.

46:47.236 --> 46:48.487
Tell me about it.

46:51.207 --> 46:54.042
What about the lithium bottle?

46:54.110 --> 46:55.894
I don't know.
It's... It's...

46:55.962 --> 46:57.296
I don't know.
I misplaced it somewhere.

46:57.330 --> 46:59.197
I don't know.
Hmm?

46:59.265 --> 47:01.349
Look, I can't explain it, but I
thought if somebody was trying to...

47:01.418 --> 47:03.735
Trying to drug you?
Mmm-hmm.

47:03.803 --> 47:05.971
Why and who?
I don't know. You tell me.

47:06.038 --> 47:08.990
I didn't prescribe it.
But your name was on the bottle.

47:09.058 --> 47:10.559
Why do you think I came here?

47:10.626 --> 47:12.361
To get some help.

47:12.428 --> 47:16.431
Obviously, you're dealing
with some inconsistencies.

47:16.599 --> 47:19.618
Well, yeah. I wake up every morning
to find my husband has died again.

47:19.686 --> 47:22.854
I think that goes just a
little beyond inconsistent.

47:25.057 --> 47:26.592
How do you feel

47:28.394 --> 47:30.595
during the times he's dead?

47:32.782 --> 47:34.082
What?

47:34.150 --> 47:37.569
I mean, what kind of emotions
run through you?

47:37.636 --> 47:41.290
Is it sorrow?
Resentment? Relief?

47:41.357 --> 47:43.041
What are you saying?

47:43.108 --> 47:46.928
Well, it's a pretty common daydream
to imagine people being dead.

47:46.996 --> 47:49.798
I'm not daydreaming, okay?
I wake up and he is dead.

47:49.866 --> 47:52.467
Except for today.

47:52.534 --> 47:55.971
Do you have any history of
mental illness in your family?

47:56.038 --> 47:57.372
No.

47:57.440 --> 48:01.310
What about yourself?
Any episodes of psychosis?

48:01.377 --> 48:02.895
Memory loss?

48:02.962 --> 48:04.680
Judgment lapses?

48:04.747 --> 48:07.649
I don't want him dead.
It was a car accident.

48:07.716 --> 48:09.517
Well, there's no crime
imagining something.

48:09.819 --> 48:12.337
I'm not imagining it.
He's dead.

48:21.447 --> 48:23.415
Well, it is a little odd

48:25.251 --> 48:28.387
that the prescription was for lithium.
Why?

48:28.454 --> 48:32.291
Because that's probably the
best thing for you right now.

48:34.227 --> 48:35.994
It'll help you cope.

48:38.097 --> 48:41.749
Do you think you can make it
in to see me here tomorrow?

49:01.738 --> 49:03.088
Hey, look who's here!

49:03.156 --> 49:05.591
Hey, Bob. Is Jim here?
Yeah.

49:05.658 --> 49:08.226
How come you don't come by
and see us anymore?

49:10.997 --> 49:13.348
Honey?
I need to talk to you.

49:13.416 --> 49:14.566
What is it?

49:15.768 --> 49:17.052
What's going on?

49:17.119 --> 49:18.936
I know I've been acting strange,
but there's something wrong.

49:19.004 --> 49:20.722
There's something very wrong.

49:20.789 --> 49:21.961
What is it, the girls?

49:21.987 --> 49:24.384
No, no, no.
They're fine, at least for now.

49:24.427 --> 49:26.061
Can we just go somewhere?
Just us?

49:26.128 --> 49:27.462
Let's just take the girls.
Let's go, just go.

49:27.530 --> 49:29.681
Linda, I can't go anywhere.
I have to work.

49:29.749 --> 49:31.699
Please! I really need you.
Can you just...

49:31.767 --> 49:33.201
Linda, I need to go
to the sales meeting.

49:35.405 --> 49:37.990
Excuse me. Jim,
we're waiting for you.

49:42.094 --> 49:43.545
I'm sorry.

49:43.612 --> 49:45.113
Who are you?

49:45.181 --> 49:48.049
I'm Claire Francis.
You must be Jim's wife.

49:48.117 --> 49:50.501
Yeah. Linda.

49:50.569 --> 49:53.088
I've seen your pictures.
It's nice to meet you.

49:54.490 --> 49:55.624
Mmm.

49:55.692 --> 49:58.293
Claire's our new
assistant manager.

50:00.779 --> 50:03.482
Your husband's been really
helpful the last few weeks.

50:04.934 --> 50:06.852
<i>Guys! We're starting.</i>

50:08.121 --> 50:09.537
Excuse me.

50:16.346 --> 50:18.546
We can talk
about this later.

50:45.141 --> 50:49.294
Who killed Cock Robin?

50:49.361 --> 50:54.399
"I," said the sparrow,
"with my little bow and arrow."

51:26.916 --> 51:29.384
Who saw him die?

51:48.804 --> 51:50.705
Oh, Christ! Girls!

51:50.773 --> 51:52.807
Hurry! The laundry's
outside. Grab it!

51:52.875 --> 51:53.858
Hurry!

51:57.629 --> 52:00.782
Start taking stuff down.
I'll meet you guys outside, okay?

52:03.753 --> 52:07.238
Bridgette, no!
Bridgette! Bridgette, no!

52:16.482 --> 52:19.450
Baby! Okay, I'm right here.
I'm right here.

52:20.770 --> 52:22.987
Megan, go get me
some towels. Please.

52:23.989 --> 52:26.273
Mommy!
I got you. I got you.

52:26.341 --> 52:29.644
Here, baby. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

52:30.813 --> 52:32.346
It's okay, baby.

52:33.799 --> 52:36.051
She's still bleeding, Mommy.

52:37.769 --> 52:40.154
Somebody! Somebody, please!
We need a gurney right away, please!

52:40.222 --> 52:41.473
I'm Dr. Norman.
Can you tell me what happened?

52:41.540 --> 52:43.341
She went through
the glass door.

52:43.408 --> 52:44.942
Any allergies that we know about?
She's allergic to codeine.

52:45.010 --> 52:46.661
Codeine.
Codeine? Okay.

52:46.729 --> 52:48.613
Put her in 14, please. Ma'am, I'm
gonna need you to wait out here.

52:48.680 --> 52:50.398
Can I go with her?
No, ma'am. We'll take care of her.

52:50.466 --> 52:52.717
Everything's gonna be fine.
It's gonna be okay, baby!

52:54.353 --> 52:55.687
Is she okay?

52:55.754 --> 52:57.488
Yeah, they just took her in.

52:57.556 --> 53:01.276
They just took her in.
You all right?

53:01.343 --> 53:03.195
What happened?
She just... She was running.

53:03.262 --> 53:04.946
I had to get the laundry
and she was...

53:05.013 --> 53:06.915
She just went through
the glass window.

53:14.206 --> 53:16.207
Honey.
It's okay.

53:18.110 --> 53:19.377
It's okay.

53:21.613 --> 53:23.748
What are you doing, Mommy?

53:23.815 --> 53:26.817
We are gonna forget about
mirrors for a while.

53:27.636 --> 53:29.420
Till you feel a little better.

53:29.488 --> 53:32.057
Is Bridgette gonna have
ugly scars forever?

53:32.124 --> 53:33.808
I don't want
any talk about scars.

53:33.876 --> 53:35.260
All right.

53:35.327 --> 53:38.196
Because as far as I'm
concerned, there are no scars.

53:40.116 --> 53:42.567
And I don't care
what anyone tells you, okay?

53:42.635 --> 53:44.219
You understand?

53:45.287 --> 53:46.838
Because you're beautiful.

53:47.957 --> 53:49.573
Like a princess?

53:53.112 --> 53:55.479
Yeah. Like a princess.

53:56.815 --> 53:58.516
My two princesses.

54:29.298 --> 54:31.382
I thought you were
gonna put up stickers.

54:32.200 --> 54:33.367
I did.

54:36.772 --> 54:38.723
I don't know. Maybe...

54:38.790 --> 54:40.658
Maybe I thought I did.

54:42.944 --> 54:44.579
Christ, Linda.

54:44.646 --> 54:48.550
What? What are you
blaming me for this, now?

54:48.617 --> 54:51.252
I've asked your mother to
come and stay while I'm gone.

54:52.655 --> 54:54.205
What? Why?

54:54.273 --> 54:56.074
Just to help, you know.
I don't need any help.

54:56.108 --> 54:58.676
Help take care of the kids.
I don't need any help.

54:58.744 --> 55:00.361
Look, you can take a break.

55:00.429 --> 55:02.697
You know, get some time
to yourself.

55:02.764 --> 55:04.715
For what? Time to myself
for what? What?

55:04.784 --> 55:06.818
So I stop acting
like a crazy person?

55:06.886 --> 55:08.202
What are you talking about?
I never...

55:08.270 --> 55:11.555
You are not separating me from my kids.
I'm a good mom.

56:29.468 --> 56:32.954
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

56:33.021 --> 56:37.892
Sunday. Monday.
Tuesday. Wednesday.

56:38.044 --> 56:41.612
Thursday. Friday. Saturday.

56:41.680 --> 56:45.816
Okay, Thursday,
find out Jim died.

56:45.885 --> 56:49.004
Find out Jim died.

56:51.674 --> 56:55.710
Monday, Jim alive again.

56:56.511 --> 56:58.579
Again.

56:58.647 --> 57:01.665
Funeral's on...
The funeral happened when?

57:01.733 --> 57:03.051
Saturday.

57:03.118 --> 57:05.954
Funeral and what else?
What else?

57:06.021 --> 57:07.905
<i>What else? We have...</i>

57:09.341 --> 57:11.625
Lithium is on Saturday.

57:13.562 --> 57:15.463
Tuesday. Tuesday.

57:17.149 --> 57:19.334
We have on Tuesday...
We have...

57:19.401 --> 57:21.086
Except for today.

57:21.887 --> 57:24.672
Meet Dr. Roth on Tuesday,

57:24.674 --> 57:26.240
and I am... Oh!

57:26.308 --> 57:28.793
Committed Saturday

57:30.595 --> 57:32.313
by Dr. Roth.

57:32.381 --> 57:35.216
Bridgette's cuts happen on...

57:35.283 --> 57:36.951
Bridgette! Bridgette!

57:37.018 --> 57:38.269
Mommy.

57:38.337 --> 57:40.004
Tuesday.

57:40.071 --> 57:42.907
Friday and Sunday
are still open and Wednesday.

57:45.427 --> 57:47.729
<i>You have one new message.</i>

57:48.597 --> 57:51.499
When?
Yesterday.

57:52.601 --> 57:54.318
Oh, God.

57:56.989 --> 57:59.006
Jim dies

58:01.226 --> 58:02.710
Wednesday.

58:03.845 --> 58:05.313
What you doing?

58:13.255 --> 58:15.090
Jim, don't go
on this trip, please.

58:15.157 --> 58:16.791
I have to.

58:16.859 --> 58:18.909
We waited a year
for this interview.

58:18.977 --> 58:21.879
Besides, it could be
good for us, you know?

58:21.947 --> 58:24.098
Take a break from each other.

58:24.166 --> 58:28.720
Well, it might be a bigger
break than you bargained for.

58:28.787 --> 58:31.623
What if something
happens to you?

58:31.690 --> 58:34.258
Something could happen to me
on my way home from work.

58:34.326 --> 58:36.360
Should I stop working?
Jim, I'm begging. You want me to beg?

58:36.428 --> 58:38.262
I will beg.
Please, just don't go.

58:38.329 --> 58:39.890
You have children
and you have a family.

58:39.948 --> 58:41.816
Why are you saying that?
You think I've forgotten that?

58:41.883 --> 58:43.485
No, I haven't...
Because I haven't!

58:43.552 --> 58:44.952
I realize that.
I didn't say that you've forgotten.

58:45.020 --> 58:46.537
All right. Good.
Just listen to me.

58:46.604 --> 58:47.788
I need for you to listen to me.
No, just stop it.

58:47.956 --> 58:49.607
No, just listen to me.
Stop it. Stop it.

58:51.543 --> 58:54.144
Just do me one favor.

58:54.212 --> 58:57.382
If tomorrow's Wednesday, just
please wake me up before you leave.

58:57.449 --> 58:59.767
If tomorrow's Wednesday?
Just... I know it sounds crazy.

58:59.835 --> 59:02.503
Just please wake me up, okay?

59:02.571 --> 59:03.888
Jesus.

59:03.956 --> 59:05.323
Promise me.

59:07.993 --> 59:09.393
I promise.

59:09.995 --> 59:11.179
Okay.

59:51.002 --> 59:53.671
Oh, that guest bed
is just awful.

59:53.739 --> 59:54.806
Mom.

59:56.174 --> 59:57.558
That's right.
You stayed over.

59:57.626 --> 59:58.943
Did you forget I was here?

59:59.010 --> 01:00:00.428
No, no, no.
No, I remember.

01:00:00.495 --> 01:00:02.997
I remember, now. So that would
have to be Friday.

01:00:03.065 --> 01:00:05.383
Friday morning.
Friday morning.

01:00:11.856 --> 01:00:14.592
All right. All right.
Okay. There's two days left.

01:00:16.027 --> 01:00:17.995
This is Sunday
and there's Friday.

01:00:18.063 --> 01:00:19.597
How do we know that?
Shit! Shit!

01:00:19.664 --> 01:00:21.199
Are you all right?
Shit!

01:00:21.266 --> 01:00:23.768
Claire. Claire Francis.
Who's Claire Francis?

01:00:23.835 --> 01:00:26.854
Who's Claire? Who's Claire?
Who's Claire Francis?

01:00:26.922 --> 01:00:27.731
<i>We talked?</i>

01:00:27.757 --> 01:00:30.232
<i>Well, yeah, yesterday.
You don't remember?</i>

01:00:30.275 --> 01:00:32.810
Claire. Claire. Yeah.

01:00:42.337 --> 01:00:43.821
Mom, I have to go.

01:00:43.888 --> 01:00:45.639
What? You need
to be with the girls.

01:00:45.707 --> 01:00:47.775
You had the shock
of your life yesterday.

01:00:47.842 --> 01:00:49.310
Tell me about it.

01:01:20.526 --> 01:01:22.877
Is there something
we should be talking about?

01:01:27.466 --> 01:01:29.767
Something involving my husband?

01:01:35.224 --> 01:01:36.758
Who told you?

01:01:39.945 --> 01:01:41.746
I think you just did.

01:01:45.617 --> 01:01:47.685
<i>He was gonna</i>
<i>cheat on me.</i>

01:01:48.754 --> 01:01:50.054
He what?

01:01:51.824 --> 01:01:55.526
Well, wait a minute.
How do you know? How did you find out?

01:01:55.594 --> 01:01:57.628
Because I talked to her.
She told me everything.

01:01:57.696 --> 01:01:59.163
When?
Today.

01:02:00.566 --> 01:02:02.633
Oh, hon, I'm sorry.

01:02:02.701 --> 01:02:04.835
Are you still in shock?
No.

01:02:06.605 --> 01:02:09.406
No, I passed up shock
a couple days ago.

01:02:10.642 --> 01:02:13.343
The whole thing is bad.

01:02:13.412 --> 01:02:16.347
The accident,
the other woman, it's a mess.

01:02:16.415 --> 01:02:18.549
I don't know if it's so bad.

01:02:20.586 --> 01:02:23.087
You know, maybe it was
supposed to happen.

01:02:23.154 --> 01:02:24.788
What do you mean?

01:02:27.459 --> 01:02:30.127
Even though he didn't do
anything yet.

01:02:30.195 --> 01:02:33.364
The damage that it would have
caused us, the girls.

01:02:35.334 --> 01:02:38.236
Maybe it was enough
that he was going to.

01:02:40.005 --> 01:02:42.273
Are you listening
to what you're saying?

01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:44.525
We were roommates, Annie.

01:02:44.592 --> 01:02:47.512
We were roommates
with two girls,

01:02:47.579 --> 01:02:49.179
and my roommate was a liar.

01:03:12.354 --> 01:03:15.323
Well, as far as your mortgage
and your daughters' education,

01:03:15.390 --> 01:03:16.907
it should all be taken care of.

01:03:16.975 --> 01:03:18.393
And with the annuity
Jim left you,

01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:21.028
you should be pretty much set
income-wise, so...

01:03:25.634 --> 01:03:29.787
You know, Linda, I have to tell
you, the timing on all this...

01:03:29.855 --> 01:03:32.873
Timing?
What do you mean, timing?

01:03:32.941 --> 01:03:35.559
Jim stopped in to see me Wednesday
morning, right before his trip.

01:03:35.627 --> 01:03:37.978
Wednesday?
Yeah.

01:03:38.046 --> 01:03:41.582
And he seemed very anxious, like
he wasn't quite sure of things,

01:03:41.649 --> 01:03:45.486
and he kept talking about you and
the girls, and he said that,

01:03:45.554 --> 01:03:49.740
no matter what happened, he wanted
to make sure you're all okay.

01:03:49.808 --> 01:03:52.025
And then he tripled
his death benefits.

01:03:52.928 --> 01:03:54.795
I mean, it's not a problem.

01:03:54.863 --> 01:03:56.630
The police reports all confirm
it was an accident.

01:03:56.698 --> 01:03:59.550
So, I'll just get this cleared
through the main office

01:03:59.618 --> 01:04:02.453
and I should have
a check for you fairly soon.

01:04:27.112 --> 01:04:28.713
Nice view, huh?

01:04:31.916 --> 01:04:33.283
Yes, very.

01:04:34.269 --> 01:04:35.936
You have a family?

01:04:40.441 --> 01:04:42.877
I have two daughters but...

01:04:44.746 --> 01:04:46.797
It's no big deal.

01:04:46.865 --> 01:04:49.250
Happens to a lot of people.

01:04:49.318 --> 01:04:51.185
They drive by here
just like you did.

01:04:51.253 --> 01:04:52.954
See the houses
by this beautiful lake

01:04:53.021 --> 01:04:54.572
and suddenly say to themselves,

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:56.991
"What a great place
to start over."

01:04:59.044 --> 01:05:01.445
I moved here after my divorce.

01:05:02.814 --> 01:05:04.582
Really?

01:05:04.649 --> 01:05:06.283
Yeah, it's great.

01:05:07.919 --> 01:05:10.020
It's like a whole new life.

01:05:15.493 --> 01:05:17.428
This moss pink velvet
is very nice.

01:05:17.495 --> 01:05:19.931
I believe I would like that
for the showroom. And...

01:05:19.998 --> 01:05:22.716
Miss Dwight, I'll have to
call you back. Thank you.

01:05:24.403 --> 01:05:25.970
Hello.

01:05:26.038 --> 01:05:27.605
I'm Dorothy Quinn.

01:05:28.590 --> 01:05:29.823
I know.

01:05:31.426 --> 01:05:32.709
Got it?

01:05:41.637 --> 01:05:43.404
Hi, honey.
Hi, Mom.

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:46.507
Hey, you.

01:05:51.813 --> 01:05:53.548
One for you.
Cool.

01:05:54.616 --> 01:05:56.150
Thanks.
And one for you.

01:05:56.218 --> 01:05:58.586
Thank you, Mommy.
You're welcome.

01:05:59.688 --> 01:06:01.656
You know how much
I love you, right?

01:06:14.052 --> 01:06:16.237
Linda?
Yeah.

01:06:18.156 --> 01:06:19.790
I don't want to upset you.

01:06:19.858 --> 01:06:21.442
What is it, Mom?

01:06:21.509 --> 01:06:23.694
I know this is very difficult,

01:06:23.761 --> 01:06:27.131
but I really do think we need to
drive out to the funeral home, dear.

01:06:27.199 --> 01:06:29.366
I'll go with you.
Oh, it's done.

01:06:30.602 --> 01:06:31.785
What?

01:06:31.853 --> 01:06:33.503
I already made
all the arrangements.

01:06:35.106 --> 01:06:37.374
Oh.

01:06:37.442 --> 01:06:40.010
Well, when were you thinking
of having the...

01:06:40.078 --> 01:06:42.396
The funeral is tomorrow.

01:06:42.463 --> 01:06:43.881
It's all set.

01:06:43.949 --> 01:06:46.350
Saturday?
Saturday.

01:06:46.417 --> 01:06:47.768
That soon?

01:06:47.835 --> 01:06:49.270
Yes, that soon.

01:07:13.694 --> 01:07:15.296
You okay, hon?

01:07:19.317 --> 01:07:20.584
Hey, Mom?

01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:23.420
Mmm-hmm.

01:07:25.090 --> 01:07:26.924
If I let Jim die,

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:32.196
is that the same thing
as killing him?

01:07:36.668 --> 01:07:38.702
Honey, Jim's already dead.

01:07:47.779 --> 01:07:49.279
Good night, dear.

01:08:41.066 --> 01:08:43.767
With silver buttons, buttons, buttons

01:08:43.835 --> 01:08:47.037
all down her shoe, shoe, shoe.

01:08:47.104 --> 01:08:50.407
She asked her grandma,
grandma, grandma

01:08:50.475 --> 01:08:54.345
for a hundred dollars,
dollars, dollars

01:08:54.412 --> 01:08:57.647
to see the bunnies,
bunnies, bunnies

01:08:57.715 --> 01:09:01.085
jump over the house,
house, house.

01:09:01.152 --> 01:09:04.121
They jumped so high, high, high

01:09:04.189 --> 01:09:05.322
they reached
the sky, sky, sky...

01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:07.791
Girls, can you
keep it down, please?

01:09:14.916 --> 01:09:16.316
It's Sunday.

01:09:17.953 --> 01:09:19.620
All day long.

01:09:24.408 --> 01:09:27.127
Hey, why don't you take the girls
out for a while? You know?

01:09:27.194 --> 01:09:29.996
You guys should
spend some time together.

01:09:30.064 --> 01:09:32.432
You can go have some fun.

01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:35.285
Yeah. Okay.
That's a good idea.

01:09:39.224 --> 01:09:41.441
You girls want Daddy to make you
some pancakes for breakfast?

01:09:41.509 --> 01:09:43.260
Yeah!

01:10:28.556 --> 01:10:29.990
Hello, Father.

01:10:32.643 --> 01:10:33.811
Linda.

01:10:34.913 --> 01:10:36.914
It's been a long time.

01:10:42.787 --> 01:10:44.571
I'm scared, Father.

01:10:50.094 --> 01:10:52.463
I want another piece
of bread!

01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:57.384
Come on,
green head! Get it!

01:10:58.903 --> 01:11:04.842
1632, Dutch trading colony
off the coast of Carolina.

01:11:04.909 --> 01:11:08.178
An hysterical midwife claimed to
have walked through the aftermath

01:11:08.246 --> 01:11:11.081
of a terrible hurricane
that hadn't happened yet.

01:11:11.983 --> 01:11:13.416
So, what happened?

01:11:13.484 --> 01:11:15.018
They hung her
for being a witch.

01:11:16.004 --> 01:11:17.905
Two days later,

01:11:17.973 --> 01:11:21.509
the entire town was wiped out
by a gale force hurricane.

01:11:22.276 --> 01:11:23.944
That's awful.

01:11:24.012 --> 01:11:26.580
I'll skip ahead
to the 20th century.

01:11:27.648 --> 01:11:30.350
Boston. 1918.

01:11:30.418 --> 01:11:33.220
At the height
of the influenza epidemic,

01:11:33.287 --> 01:11:35.889
a father told friends
he'd been to the future

01:11:35.957 --> 01:11:38.942
and seen the graves
of his two small children.

01:11:39.010 --> 01:11:42.762
He went insane and shot them
both to spare them the disease.

01:11:42.830 --> 01:11:44.447
Oh, my God.

01:11:44.515 --> 01:11:48.502
The autopsy showed the
children were never infected.

01:11:48.570 --> 01:11:50.770
He shot himself a week later.

01:11:53.207 --> 01:11:55.893
Who are these people?
Why did it happen?

01:11:55.961 --> 01:12:00.648
You see, history's full
of unexplained phenomena.

01:12:01.616 --> 01:12:03.900
Nobody knows why.

01:12:03.968 --> 01:12:08.355
Some people thought they suffered
from what the ancients called

01:12:09.373 --> 01:12:12.259
<i>Blasphemare absens fides.</i>

01:12:13.178 --> 01:12:15.462
The dangers of the faithless.

01:12:16.731 --> 01:12:18.365
The faithless?

01:12:18.433 --> 01:12:23.637
It's the notion that nature abhors
a vacuum, even a spiritual one.

01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:27.741
People who've lost
their beliefs,

01:12:29.093 --> 01:12:31.845
they're like empty vessels,

01:12:31.847 --> 01:12:34.465
more susceptible to having
their lives taken over

01:12:34.532 --> 01:12:37.067
by forces bigger
than themselves.

01:12:37.134 --> 01:12:39.102
Almost like a curse.

01:12:39.170 --> 01:12:40.871
Or a miracle.

01:12:42.507 --> 01:12:45.242
Yeah, well, I don't
believe in miracles.

01:12:45.309 --> 01:12:49.346
Every day we're alive
can be a miracle, Linda.

01:12:49.414 --> 01:12:51.448
Well, it doesn't feel that way.

01:12:52.083 --> 01:12:53.617
Not for me.

01:12:55.302 --> 01:12:57.504
Father,

01:12:57.571 --> 01:12:59.606
something bad
is going to happen.

01:13:01.109 --> 01:13:03.409
I need your...
I need your help.

01:13:03.477 --> 01:13:05.879
I need your direction.
I need faith.

01:13:07.949 --> 01:13:13.119
Faith is just believing
in something beyond yourself,

01:13:13.187 --> 01:13:18.341
something you can't feel,
or smell, or touch,

01:13:18.409 --> 01:13:21.111
like hope or love.

01:13:24.181 --> 01:13:26.549
I believe I've let that all go.

01:13:28.770 --> 01:13:31.972
Maybe you should try
and get it back again, huh?

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:33.607
But if it's too late...

01:13:33.641 --> 01:13:38.746
It's never too late to realize
what's important in your life,

01:13:38.813 --> 01:13:40.497
to fight for it.

01:13:42.350 --> 01:13:44.651
I don't know what to fight for.

01:15:01.229 --> 01:15:04.664
<i>He was on the highway,
around mile marker 220.</i>

01:15:09.537 --> 01:15:11.020
<i>Mrs. Hanson?</i>

01:15:13.841 --> 01:15:15.225
<i>Ma'am?</i>

01:15:16.928 --> 01:15:18.769
<i>Who are these people?</i>
<i>Why did it happen?</i>

01:15:18.813 --> 01:15:20.547
<i>History's full of</i>
<i>unexplained phenomenon.</i>

01:15:20.615 --> 01:15:21.948
<i>Bridgette! No, Bridgette!</i>

01:15:22.016 --> 01:15:23.182
<i>Nobody knows why.</i>

01:15:23.250 --> 01:15:25.518
<i>Open it up!</i>
<i>Open it up! No!</i>

01:15:25.586 --> 01:15:28.721
<i>Obviously, you're dealing
with some inconsistencies.</i>

01:15:28.789 --> 01:15:30.073
<i>No!</i>

01:15:30.141 --> 01:15:31.758
<i>Dangers of the faithless.</i>

01:15:31.826 --> 01:15:33.360
<i>I'm Claire Francis.</i>

01:15:33.428 --> 01:15:35.628
<i>Your husband's been really
helpful the last few weeks.</i>

01:15:35.696 --> 01:15:37.214
<i>Jim.</i>

01:15:37.281 --> 01:15:40.416
<i>How do you feel</i>
<i>during the times he's dead?</i>

01:15:40.484 --> 01:15:42.703
<i>We don't want anyone</i>
<i>getting hurt now, do we?</i>

01:15:42.770 --> 01:15:43.921
<i>If I let Jim die...</i>

01:15:43.988 --> 01:15:45.455
<i>It's never too late.</i>

01:15:45.523 --> 01:15:47.507
<i>is that the same
thing as killing him?</i>

01:15:47.574 --> 01:15:48.792
<i>Inconsistencies.</i>

01:15:48.859 --> 01:15:50.794
<i>The same thing as killing him?</i>

01:16:23.962 --> 01:16:25.578
Did you guys have a good time?

01:16:25.646 --> 01:16:27.196
Yeah. Yeah.

01:16:27.264 --> 01:16:28.998
We had a great time.

01:16:30.868 --> 01:16:32.002
Good.

01:16:59.180 --> 01:17:01.164
Let me help you with that.

01:17:04.068 --> 01:17:05.552
Smells good.

01:17:23.304 --> 01:17:25.439
Oh, good girls.

01:17:28.309 --> 01:17:29.342
Night.

01:17:29.410 --> 01:17:30.827
Night.
Night.

01:17:31.662 --> 01:17:33.429
Good night, baby.

01:17:33.498 --> 01:17:35.298
Come here. Give me a kiss.

01:17:35.366 --> 01:17:36.783
Hey, why don't
you girls go give your dad

01:17:36.851 --> 01:17:38.568
another hug, nice and tight?

01:17:38.636 --> 01:17:40.269
Okay.
Okay.

01:17:42.356 --> 01:17:43.739
What's this all about?

01:17:43.807 --> 01:17:46.392
Mama said to give you extra hugs.
Yeah.

01:17:46.460 --> 01:17:49.479
Extra hugs? Oh, how about
extra hugs and extra kisses?

01:17:52.517 --> 01:17:54.434
Now, off to bed.
Go brush your teeth.

01:17:54.502 --> 01:17:57.371
Hey, girls, why don't you tell
Daddy how much you love him?

01:17:57.373 --> 01:17:59.273
Love you, Daddy.
Me, too!

01:17:59.340 --> 01:18:01.174
Well, thank you, ladies.

01:18:04.262 --> 01:18:05.878
Aren't you gonna tell them?

01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:09.416
Tell them what?
That you love them.

01:18:11.118 --> 01:18:13.253
You do love them, don't you?

01:18:14.789 --> 01:18:16.356
Of course I do.

01:18:17.391 --> 01:18:18.758
Then tell them.

01:18:22.380 --> 01:18:25.082
You girls know how much
I love you, right?

01:18:25.149 --> 01:18:27.283
Huh? Right?

01:18:27.351 --> 01:18:30.787
I love you more than anything
in the whole wide world.

01:18:33.190 --> 01:18:34.724
Mom, too?

01:18:36.343 --> 01:18:38.312
More than anything?

01:18:44.451 --> 01:18:46.185
I do love your mom.

01:18:47.688 --> 01:18:49.406
I love her very much.

01:19:12.830 --> 01:19:14.080
Linda!

01:19:24.408 --> 01:19:26.543
What are you doing out here?

01:19:31.966 --> 01:19:34.100
Honey, let's go back inside.

01:19:35.036 --> 01:19:37.086
How did we get here, Jim?

01:19:38.839 --> 01:19:40.039
I miss you!

01:19:40.675 --> 01:19:42.325
I miss us!

01:19:42.393 --> 01:19:44.310
There's still an us.
It's just different now, that's all.

01:19:44.378 --> 01:19:46.880
Why? Why is it different?
I don't know why.

01:19:46.947 --> 01:19:48.748
What did you expect us
to be like?

01:19:48.815 --> 01:19:50.784
Just the way we used to be!

01:19:52.336 --> 01:19:53.703
Linda, look at us.
We're married.

01:19:53.771 --> 01:19:56.656
We got a house,
a mortgage, two kids!

01:19:56.724 --> 01:19:58.341
Why do we have to
talk about this now?

01:19:58.408 --> 01:19:59.542
Why can't we just go inside?

01:19:59.610 --> 01:20:02.245
Because we're running
out of time!

01:20:11.639 --> 01:20:12.889
Watch out!

01:21:55.176 --> 01:21:56.509
I'm sorry.

01:21:59.913 --> 01:22:01.531
I'm so sorry.

01:22:59.407 --> 01:23:00.540
What?

01:23:01.676 --> 01:23:02.775
What?

01:23:05.079 --> 01:23:06.813
You have that look.

01:23:08.549 --> 01:23:09.882
What look?

01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:14.721
Like you want
to tell me something.

01:23:24.232 --> 01:23:26.566
I had a dream you're gonna die.

01:23:31.205 --> 01:23:33.106
That was only a dream.

01:23:34.342 --> 01:23:36.443
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:23:55.128 --> 01:23:56.329
Hello.

01:23:56.397 --> 01:23:58.281
Annie! Annie,
what day is it today?

01:23:58.348 --> 01:24:01.501
It's Wednesday, it's Wednesday.
What's the matter?

01:24:01.568 --> 01:24:03.219
Shit!

01:24:03.287 --> 01:24:05.487
Girls? Girls? Jim?

01:24:07.275 --> 01:24:08.341
Jim?

01:24:09.810 --> 01:24:10.877
Jim?

01:24:11.628 --> 01:24:13.012
Shoot.

01:24:15.165 --> 01:24:17.684
"Took the girls to school.
Be back tomorrow."

01:24:21.238 --> 01:24:23.189
Answer the phone.

01:24:23.257 --> 01:24:24.958
<i>Hi, this is Jim Hanson.</i>

01:24:25.025 --> 01:24:26.392
<i>I can't get</i>
<i>to your call right now,</i>

01:24:26.460 --> 01:24:28.394
<i>but if you'll leave a message,</i>

01:24:28.462 --> 01:24:30.630
<i>I'll get back to you</i>
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

01:24:30.698 --> 01:24:32.298
<i>Thanks for calling.</i>

01:24:45.863 --> 01:24:49.349
I should be able to take care
of this right away. No problem.

01:24:52.219 --> 01:24:53.686
Thanks, Doug.

01:25:33.093 --> 01:25:33.820
Hey.

01:25:33.846 --> 01:25:36.754
I just got to the room.
It's really nice.

01:25:38.866 --> 01:25:41.267
I can't wait for you
to get here.

01:25:43.036 --> 01:25:45.555
Jim? Is something wrong?

01:25:46.089 --> 01:25:47.189
Yeah.

01:25:48.492 --> 01:25:49.859
I'm sorry, I can't.

01:25:50.861 --> 01:25:52.495
I can't do this.

01:25:55.248 --> 01:25:57.099
Do what? The interview?

01:25:59.986 --> 01:26:01.020
Us.

01:26:05.809 --> 01:26:06.909
Jim.

01:26:09.530 --> 01:26:10.596
<i>Jim.</i>

01:26:15.418 --> 01:26:17.620
<i>Pick up.
Pick up, Jim. Pick up.</i>

01:26:26.964 --> 01:26:28.832
<i>Hi, you've
reached the Hanson residence.</i>

01:26:28.899 --> 01:26:31.084
<i>You know what to do.</i>

01:26:31.151 --> 01:26:34.753
Listen, Linda, I need
to tell you something.

01:26:37.591 --> 01:26:41.594
I meant what I said in front of
the girls the other night, and...

01:26:43.096 --> 01:26:46.265
Well, I just, I want you
to know that

01:26:48.285 --> 01:26:50.186
<i>and please remember it.</i>

01:26:53.290 --> 01:26:56.108
Damn it.
Someone's calling. Hold on.

01:26:57.327 --> 01:27:00.213
Is that you? Linda?

01:27:00.281 --> 01:27:02.715
Jim?
I love you, honey.

01:27:05.602 --> 01:27:08.053
I need to tell you something.

01:27:08.121 --> 01:27:10.055
It's all right,
I know about her.

01:27:10.123 --> 01:27:12.074
I know about Claire.

01:27:13.110 --> 01:27:14.260
You do?

01:27:14.711 --> 01:27:15.694
Yeah.

01:27:17.230 --> 01:27:19.299
I have to explain it,
but it's...

01:27:19.449 --> 01:27:22.618
Honey, honey, honey, listen. I thought
that's what I wanted, but I don't.

01:27:22.686 --> 01:27:24.069
<i>I just...</i>

01:27:24.137 --> 01:27:27.407
I want to make things better,
you know? Between us.

01:27:28.676 --> 01:27:30.526
Whatever it takes.

01:27:35.615 --> 01:27:39.185
I see you. I see you.
I'm coming up right behind you.

01:27:39.986 --> 01:27:41.370
<i>You are?</i>

01:27:42.456 --> 01:27:44.056
I'm pulling over.

01:27:46.877 --> 01:27:48.727
Thank you. Thank you.

01:27:53.650 --> 01:27:55.451
<i>I can see you, honey.</i>

01:27:57.538 --> 01:27:58.904
Oh, no.

01:28:05.078 --> 01:28:08.281
Jim, do you love me?
Do you trust me?

01:28:08.349 --> 01:28:09.582
<i>Of course I do.</i>

01:28:09.650 --> 01:28:12.201
Then turn around now.

01:28:12.269 --> 01:28:14.887
What? I don't understand.
<i>Turn it around.</i>

01:28:21.695 --> 01:28:22.728
Jim.

01:28:29.285 --> 01:28:30.870
Are you okay?

01:28:30.938 --> 01:28:32.104
Jim!

01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:35.358
Jim. Baby,
are you all right?

01:28:35.943 --> 01:28:38.427
<i>Jim.</i>

01:28:38.495 --> 01:28:41.647
<i>Can you hear me? Are you okay?</i>
<i>Baby, can you hear me?</i>

01:28:42.966 --> 01:28:45.718
Sorry, I dropped the phone.

01:28:45.786 --> 01:28:47.436
I love you.

01:28:47.504 --> 01:28:48.771
<i>Let's go home.</i>

01:28:48.839 --> 01:28:50.172
Okay. Hold on.

01:28:52.909 --> 01:28:54.911
Stalled it.

01:29:00.133 --> 01:29:02.051
Oh, no. Oh, no.

01:29:03.369 --> 01:29:05.921
Jim. Jim, get out of the car.

01:29:07.541 --> 01:29:10.209
Jim. Jim, get out of the car.

01:29:13.012 --> 01:29:14.113
Jesus.

01:29:15.915 --> 01:29:17.199
Jim! Jim! Get...

01:29:19.219 --> 01:29:20.569
Shit.

01:29:22.456 --> 01:29:24.223
Get out of the car.

01:29:27.411 --> 01:29:28.628
Oh, my God!

01:29:38.821 --> 01:29:41.090
Jim, get out of the car!

01:29:56.590 --> 01:29:57.723
Jim!

01:29:59.977 --> 01:30:01.143
Baby!

01:31:10.530 --> 01:31:13.098
Mommy, they're here.
Hmm?

01:31:14.667 --> 01:31:16.869
Oh, baby, I must have
fallen asleep.

01:31:16.937 --> 01:31:18.304
The moving truck is here.

01:31:18.372 --> 01:31:19.872
I know. I heard.

01:31:21.575 --> 01:31:23.292
Healing so nicely.

01:31:26.029 --> 01:31:28.513
Why don't you guys go downstairs?
I'll be there in a second, okay?

01:31:28.581 --> 01:31:29.982
Okay.
Okay.

<i>Faith is just believing
in something beyond yourself,</i>

01:31:53.890 --> 01:31:56.258
<i>like hope or love.</i>

01:31:58.845 --> 01:32:03.582
It's never too late to realize
what's important in your life,

01:32:03.650 --> 01:32:05.551
to fight for it.

01:32:06.769 --> 01:32:09.071
I don't know what to fight for.
