01:14.500 --> 01:16.875
<c.speaker>Tackin' up these posters
is giving me splinters!

01:16.875 --> 01:18.625
<c.speaker>[spits] Tell me why
you're not letting

01:18.625 --> 01:20.250
<c.speaker>the Royal Guards
put these up.

01:20.250 --> 01:23.750
<c.speakerTop>They're putting up plenty,
but Victor and Carla Delgado

01:23.750 --> 01:26.375
<c.speakerTop>are the most dangerous
criminals in Avalor,

01:26.375 --> 01:28.375
<c.speakerTop>so we all have
to chip in!

01:28.375 --> 01:31.333
<c.speakerTop>Princess!
We have a lead.

01:31.333 --> 01:34.000
<c.speaker>A farmer spotted their carriage
not far from here.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.291
<c.speaker>They were heading south
toward the mountains.

01:36.291 --> 01:38.375
<c.speaker>Sounds like they're trying
to get out of Avalor.

01:38.375 --> 01:41.083
<c.speaker>Migs, Luna, head south
and search the mountains.

01:41.083 --> 01:44.458
<c.speaker>I have to hold
an emergency meeting
with the Grand Council.

01:44.458 --> 01:47.583
<c.speaker>-Come on, Skylar.
-Don't worry, Princess,
we'll find them.

01:47.583 --> 01:48.875
<c.speaker>Uh-huh!

01:55.583 --> 01:58.166

<c.speaker>[horse neighs]

02:04.000 --> 02:05.458
<c.speaker>They didn't see us.

02:05.458 --> 02:08.125
<c.speaker>Nasty pests!

02:08.125 --> 02:10.458
<c.speaker>When I take the kingdom back,

02:10.458 --> 02:13.416
<c.speaker>there'll be no more

02:13.416 --> 02:16.458
<c.speaker>No more Princess Elena!
No more--

02:16.458 --> 02:18.458
<c.speaker>[Carla] Ugh!
Wanted posters.

02:18.458 --> 02:20.458
<c.speaker>I mean, you can
barely see me,

02:20.458 --> 02:22.958
<c.speaker>and I'm just
as wanted as he is.

02:22.958 --> 02:24.375
<c.speaker>Kids today.

02:24.375 --> 02:27.291
<c.speaker>Oh! Enough complaining.

02:27.291 --> 02:30.375
<c.speaker>Since you've failed
to obtain the Jewel of Maru,

02:30.375 --> 02:33.083
<c.speaker>we must cross the border
into Paraíso

02:33.083 --> 02:38.583
<c.speaker>and find a jewel magical enough
to make my new wand!

02:38.583 --> 02:41.291
<c.speaker>-[Victor urges horses]
-[Carla] Whoa!

02:41.291 --> 02:44.833
<c.speaker>We think they're
heading... here,

02:44.833 --> 02:46.875
<c.speaker>the Kingdom of Paraíso.

02:46.875 --> 02:49.875
<c.speaker>Yes, well,
if they enter Paraíso,
they're as good as gone.

02:49.875 --> 02:52.333
<c.speaker>The Paraísoans
will never help us.

02:52.333 --> 02:54.416
<c.speaker>-Why not?
-Because of our feud.

02:54.416 --> 02:57.166
<c.speaker>We have a feud?
What are we fighting about?

02:57.166 --> 02:59.333
<c.speaker>-Chocolate.
-Chocolate?

02:59.333 --> 03:00.875
<c.speaker>No, I can see that.
[munches]

03:00.875 --> 03:03.458
<c.speaker>Some things are worth
fighting over.

03:03.458 --> 03:06.208
<c.speaker>It all started
many generations ago

03:06.208 --> 03:08.125
<c.speaker>when the King of Avalor
gave a gift

03:08.125 --> 03:11.375
<c.speaker>of our finest chocolate
to the King of Paradiso.

03:11.375 --> 03:13.416
<c.speaker>But the King of Paraíso
was insulted.

03:13.416 --> 03:16.083
<c.speaker>He thought he were saying
that our chocolate is better.

03:16.083 --> 03:17.458
<c.speaker>Ours is better.

03:17.458 --> 03:18.583
<c.speaker>See what I mean?

03:18.583 --> 03:20.750
<c.speaker>Insults flew,
feelings were hurt,

03:20.750 --> 03:24.083
<c.speaker>and the next thing you know,
poof, instant feud.

03:24.083 --> 03:28.333
<c.speaker>Wow, that is the most ridiculous
thing I have ever heard!

03:28.333 --> 03:29.625
<c.speaker>We need to know

03:29.625 --> 03:31.583
<c.speaker>the Paraísoans will help us
catch them,

03:31.583 --> 03:33.458
<c.speaker>and they need to know
we'd do the same.

03:33.458 --> 03:36.375
<c.speaker>Hmm. You make
a very good point, mijita.

03:36.375 --> 03:38.375
<c.speaker>I agree.
But how do you suggest

03:38.375 --> 03:40.375
<c.speaker>we mend our friendship?

03:40.375 --> 03:44.458
<c.speaker>Hmm. Let's invite
the Princess of Paraíso here

03:44.458 --> 03:46.500
<c.speaker>and roll out
the red carpet!

03:46.500 --> 03:49.083
<c.speaker>By the time she leaves,
we'll have a signed treaty

03:49.083 --> 03:50.958
<c.speaker>to protect
and defend each other.

03:50.958 --> 03:52.375
<c.speaker>All in favor of offering

03:52.375 --> 03:55.750
<c.speaker>the hand of friendship
to Paradiso?

03:57.208 --> 03:58.291
<c.speaker>Uh...

04:00.083 --> 04:03.458
<c.speaker>Great. Looks like it's time
to roll out the red carpet.

04:05.375 --> 04:06.958
<c.speaker>Here they come!

04:11.375 --> 04:14.875
<c.speaker>[neighing]

04:17.333 --> 04:19.083
<c.speaker>-Whoa!
-Oi!

04:21.416 --> 04:22.458
<c.speaker>[glass tinkles]

04:25.583 --> 04:31.416
<c.speaker>Greetings! May I present
Princess Elena of Avalor!

04:31.416 --> 04:37.875
<c.speaker>And may I present
Princess Valentina Montañez
Torres of Paraíso...

04:37.875 --> 04:39.291
<c.speaker>It's a pleasure--

04:39.291 --> 04:41.250
<c.speaker>-...defender of the realm...
-Oh, okay.

04:41.250 --> 04:43.166
<c.speaker>...the shining light
of the south...

04:43.166 --> 04:46.708
<c.speaker>-Welcome to Av--
-...seventeenth heir
to the golden throne...

04:46.708 --> 04:49.583
<c.speaker>Manuel, please,
they get it.

04:49.583 --> 04:51.000
<c.speaker>I keep trying
to tell Manuel

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
<c.speaker>he doesn't need to
say all that stuff

04:53.000 --> 04:55.750
<c.speaker>about how I'm
the Beloved Champion
of the People.

04:55.750 --> 04:57.750
<c.speaker>Oh, he didn't say that.
[chuckles]

04:57.750 --> 04:59.291
<c.speaker>He didn't?!

04:59.291 --> 05:02.083
<c.speaker>Oh! Well,
good job, Manuel.

05:02.083 --> 05:04.000
<c.speaker>You can just
call me Val.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.625
<c.speaker>And you can
call me Elena.

05:05.625 --> 05:08.583
<c.speaker>I have really been looking
forward to this visit.

05:08.583 --> 05:10.458
<c.speaker>It's so silly
that our kingdoms

05:10.458 --> 05:13.708
<c.speaker>let some ridiculous feud
keep us apart all these years.

05:13.708 --> 05:15.625
<c.speaker>That's just
what I was saying!

05:15.625 --> 05:18.125
<c.speaker>And, you know,
it's more important
than ever that we get along,

05:18.125 --> 05:21.458
<c.speaker>because we have two fugitives
who may be heading your way.

05:21.458 --> 05:25.625
<c.speaker>I heard! Lucky for you,
our army catches
all our bad guys,

05:25.625 --> 05:28.500
<c.speaker>so I'm sure they'll have
no problem catching yours...

05:28.500 --> 05:31.500
<c.speaker>once we sign the treaty.
[chuckles]

05:31.500 --> 05:34.750
<c.speaker>That's very neighborly
of you.

05:34.750 --> 05:38.000
<c.speaker>Val, I'd like you
to meet my Grand Council.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.833
<c.speaker>-Bienvenida!
-Welcome!

05:40.833 --> 05:43.625
<c.speaker>[sighs] I'm glad
there are only five of you.

05:43.625 --> 05:46.333
<c.speaker>My father has so many people
on his royal cabinet,

05:46.333 --> 05:48.708
<c.speaker>I can't remember
any of their names.

05:48.708 --> 05:53.583
<c.speaker>Ahem. I suppose Elena
does not need as much help.

05:53.583 --> 05:55.708
<c.speaker>Play nice, Esteban.

05:55.708 --> 05:59.333
<c.speaker>She must not, if she lets
a kid sit on her council.

05:59.333 --> 06:02.000
<c.speaker>-Kid?!
-Play nice, Naomi.

06:06.875 --> 06:09.125
<c.speaker>What a cozy little palace
you have here!

06:09.125 --> 06:13.500
<c.speaker>My castle is so huge
you could get lost
in there for days.

06:13.500 --> 06:16.291
<c.speaker>I'm starting to wish
she would get lost.

06:16.291 --> 06:18.708
<c.speaker>Princess Valentina,
we have prepared

06:18.708 --> 06:20.875
<c.speaker>a little treat for you
in the parlor.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.500
<c.speaker>Please have some
té de manzanilla.

06:25.500 --> 06:27.000
<c.speaker>Fresh from my garden!

06:27.000 --> 06:29.458
<c.speaker>So kind of you!

06:29.458 --> 06:31.708
<c.speaker>But I brought
té de limón for you

06:31.708 --> 06:33.958
<c.speaker>from my abele's garden
in Paraíso.

06:33.958 --> 06:37.000
<c.speaker>Ah! It's like
your té de manzanilla,

06:37.000 --> 06:40.708
<c.speaker>only fuller, livelier,
with a nice little kick.

06:40.708 --> 06:42.583
<c.speaker>I'll give you
a nice little--

06:42.583 --> 06:43.708
<c.speaker>Song!
[chuckles]

06:43.708 --> 06:46.208
<c.speaker>Abuelo, would you
do us the honor?

06:46.208 --> 06:48.583
<c.speaker>Ya! It is
an Avaloran tradition

06:48.583 --> 06:51.208
<c.speaker>to welcome
our guests with music.

06:51.208 --> 06:52.708

06:52.708 --> 06:55.583

10:22.750 --> 10:24.458
<c.speaker>of your
beautiful kingdom.

10:24.458 --> 10:25.958
<c.speaker>It's only half
the size of mine,

10:25.958 --> 10:27.958
<c.speaker>so it shouldn't take
too long, right?

10:27.958 --> 10:29.708
<c.speaker>-That's it!
-Great idea.

10:29.708 --> 10:31.000
<c.speaker>Let's go!

10:31.000 --> 10:33.708
<c.speaker>[gasps]
Not in this old thing!

10:33.708 --> 10:35.750
<c.speaker>-[neighing]
-[porter screams]

10:37.958 --> 10:39.125
<c.speaker>Watch where you're going!

10:39.125 --> 10:40.875
<c.speaker>[laughs] Oh, I'm sorry.

10:40.875 --> 10:43.416
<c.speaker>I forgot to look down.

10:43.416 --> 10:45.750
<c.speaker>Why don't we take
my ride?

10:45.750 --> 10:48.083
<c.speaker>As you can see,
it's much roomier.

10:48.083 --> 10:50.166
<c.speaker>Are we really
taking their coach?

10:50.166 --> 10:52.125
<c.speaker>We are doing
whatever Val wants

10:52.125 --> 10:53.750
<c.speaker>because she's our guest,

10:53.750 --> 10:56.458
<c.speaker>and we need her
to sign that treaty.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.583
<c.speaker>Faster!

10:59.583 --> 11:01.583
<c.speaker>We have to get to Paraíso.

11:01.583 --> 11:03.000
<c.speaker>The road is too uneven.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.208
<c.speaker>It's not safe.

11:04.208 --> 11:05.875
<c.speaker>I said faster!

11:07.125 --> 11:13.083
<c.speaker>-[neighing]
-[all exclaiming]

11:13.083 --> 11:15.291
<c.speaker>Oh, get off me!

11:15.291 --> 11:17.000
<c.speaker>Is this your idea
of "faster"?

11:17.000 --> 11:18.416
<c.speaker>What happened?

11:18.416 --> 11:20.875
<c.speaker>We hit a mud pit
which I did not see,

11:20.875 --> 11:23.208
<c.speaker>because we were going
too fast!

11:23.208 --> 11:26.166
<c.speaker>Excuses, excuses.

11:26.166 --> 11:28.000
<c.speaker>We will have
to continue
on horseback.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.458
<c.speaker>Oh, I despise horses!

11:30.458 --> 11:32.458
<c.speaker>[snorts]

11:37.000 --> 11:39.875
<c.speaker>And this is
our Olaball stadium.

11:39.875 --> 11:41.500
<c.speaker>Ooh! I love Olaball.

11:41.500 --> 11:43.000
<c.speaker>Stop the coach!

11:43.000 --> 11:44.583
<c.speaker>[brakes squeal]

11:46.250 --> 11:49.000
<c.speaker>Very impressive.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
<c.speaker>Let me guess!
Yours is bigger.

11:51.000 --> 11:51.833
<c.speaker>You've been there?

11:51.833 --> 11:53.250
<c.speaker>I just think it's great

11:53.250 --> 11:55.000
<c.speaker>that we have
so much in common!

11:55.000 --> 11:56.458
<c.speaker>We all love Olaball!

11:56.458 --> 11:58.875
<c.speaker>We won the Olaball tournament
last year.

11:58.875 --> 12:01.958
<c.speaker>Pfft, we won our last
five tournaments.

12:01.958 --> 12:04.875
<c.speaker>Well, maybe we should play
a game and see who's better.

12:04.875 --> 12:07.083
<c.speaker>Gabe, I don't know
if that's such a good id--

12:07.083 --> 12:09.708
<c.speaker>Great idea! You and Gabe
versus me and Manuel.

12:09.708 --> 12:11.250
<c.speaker>The kid can keep score.

12:11.250 --> 12:12.625
<c.speaker>-[Naomi grunts]
-Sure!

12:12.625 --> 12:14.875
<c.speaker>A friendly game
of Olaball sounds like fun.

12:14.875 --> 12:16.458
<c.speaker>Doesn't it?

12:17.458 --> 12:19.208
<c.speaker>[grunting]

12:23.125 --> 12:25.833
<c.speaker>Gabe Goalmaker!

12:25.833 --> 12:26.875
<c.speaker>Manny Marauder!

12:28.000 --> 12:29.083
<c.speaker>[Valentina] Score!

12:32.000 --> 12:34.875
<c.speaker>-[Elena] Castle Ca--
-[Valentina] Princess Punch!

12:34.875 --> 12:37.125
<c.speaker>[Manuel] Score!

12:38.250 --> 12:40.583
<c.speaker>-Hey!
-Power pummel!

12:40.583 --> 12:42.375
<c.speaker>[Valentina] Score!

12:42.375 --> 12:44.625
<c.speaker>-[Valentina] Sharpshooter!
-[Manuel] Score!

12:44.625 --> 12:46.375
<c.speaker>Flick and fade!

12:46.375 --> 12:48.083
<c.speaker>[Valentina] Score!

12:48.083 --> 12:49.708
<c.speaker>Aah!

12:49.708 --> 12:52.833
<c.speaker>-[Manuel] Score!
-Valentina victory!

12:52.833 --> 12:53.875
<c.speakerTop>[heaving]

12:53.875 --> 12:57.083
<c.speakerTop>The final score is
Avalor, zero,

12:57.083 --> 12:59.875
<c.speakerTop>Paraíso, too many
to count.

12:59.875 --> 13:01.333
<c.speaker>Are you okay?

13:01.333 --> 13:03.458
<c.speaker>I will be, after we
win the next match.

13:03.458 --> 13:05.166
<c.speaker>Best two out of three,
let's go!

13:05.166 --> 13:07.125
<c.speaker>Princess Elena,
the jaquin scouts

13:07.125 --> 13:10.125
<c.speaker>found Victor's carriage
on the road to Paraíso.

13:10.125 --> 13:11.583
<c.speaker>You were right, Elena,

13:11.583 --> 13:13.291
<c.speaker>they are headed
to the border.

13:13.291 --> 13:15.833
<c.speaker>We need their guards
to be on the lookout.

13:15.833 --> 13:17.833
<c.speaker>We must get
this treaty signed!

13:17.833 --> 13:19.583
<c.speaker>What am I supposed to do?

13:19.583 --> 13:21.958
<c.speaker>She turns everything
into a competition.

13:21.958 --> 13:24.958
<c.speaker>[both] Paraíso! Paraíso!

13:24.958 --> 13:26.000
<c.speaker>Ooh! Ooh!

13:26.000 --> 13:27.416
<c.speaker>This is true.

13:27.416 --> 13:30.416
<c.speaker>So we will just have
to take her someplace

13:30.416 --> 13:32.166
<c.speaker>she cannot criticize.

13:32.166 --> 13:33.583
<c.speaker>Where?

13:33.583 --> 13:36.208
<c.speaker>We are going
to visit the Twin Xolos,

13:36.208 --> 13:40.125
<c.speaker>two monumental statues that
our kingdoms built together.

13:40.125 --> 13:42.083
<c.speaker>It's based on a myth
about twin dogs

13:42.083 --> 13:44.000
<c.speaker>that never left
each other's side.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.416
<c.speaker>I know this myth.

13:45.416 --> 13:47.708
<c.speaker>Of course you do.
You know everything.

13:47.708 --> 13:50.000
<c.speaker>Maybe Valentina and I
should ride ahead

13:50.000 --> 13:52.125
<c.speaker>so we can get
to know each other better.

13:52.125 --> 13:53.958
<c.speaker>I'd love that.

14:04.625 --> 14:07.875
<c.speaker>Hey, so maybe later
you can teach me
that Princess Punch.

14:07.875 --> 14:09.416
<c.speaker>That's a great move.

14:09.416 --> 14:12.583
<c.speaker>Oh, uh, thanks.

14:12.583 --> 14:15.000
<c.speaker>[inhales, exhales]

14:15.000 --> 14:18.458
<c.speaker>There's nothing like the smell
of fresh mountain air.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.875
<c.speaker>It reminds me
of my favorite trail
back home.

14:20.875 --> 14:22.583
<c.speaker>-Does it?
-Mm-hmm.

14:22.583 --> 14:24.083
<c.speaker>I try to go riding
once a week

14:24.083 --> 14:27.250
<c.speaker>to clear my head
and get rid of all
the royal hubbub.

14:27.250 --> 14:29.250
<c.speaker>I know what you mean.

14:29.250 --> 14:33.500
<c.speaker>Sometimes it's nice
to just be yourself.

14:33.500 --> 14:37.625
<c.speaker>And not have to be
the perfect princess
with all the answers.

14:37.625 --> 14:39.416
<c.speaker>[scoffs] Tell me about it.

14:39.416 --> 14:41.250
<c.speaker>You know, I've never
really talked

14:41.250 --> 14:42.625
<c.speaker>to anyone
about this stuff.

14:42.625 --> 14:45.250
<c.speaker>It's nice finding someone
to confide in, isn't it?

14:45.250 --> 14:48.000
<c.speaker>What are you saying?
I have no friends?

14:48.000 --> 14:49.291
<c.speaker>No, that's not what I--

14:49.291 --> 14:51.583
<c.speaker>Because I have
hundreds of friends!

14:51.583 --> 14:55.125
<c.speaker>-How many do you have?
-Um, well... Look!

14:55.125 --> 14:57.458
<c.speaker>The Twin Xolos.

14:57.458 --> 14:59.083
<c.speaker>I'll race you
to the top!

14:59.083 --> 15:00.875
<c.speaker>There's no need
to race.

15:00.875 --> 15:02.250
<c.speaker>I suppose you're right.

15:02.250 --> 15:05.083
<c.speaker>Maravilla is clearly faster.

15:05.083 --> 15:08.250
<c.speaker>Canela is the fastest horse
in the kingdom!

15:08.250 --> 15:09.458
<c.speaker>[neighing]

15:09.458 --> 15:11.458
<c.speaker>Your kingdom.
Come on!

15:11.458 --> 15:13.333
<c.speaker>Come on, winner
gets a year supply

15:13.333 --> 15:15.958
<c.speaker>of Paraíso chocolate,
the best in the world!

15:15.958 --> 15:17.250
<c.speaker>[neighing]

15:17.250 --> 15:18.625
<c.speaker>[gasps] Oh, no!

15:18.625 --> 15:21.083
<c.speaker>Avalor chocolate is better!

15:21.083 --> 15:22.208
<c.speaker>[neighing]

15:24.291 --> 15:26.708
<c.speaker>-We gotta catch up. Hyah!
-Hey!

15:28.166 --> 15:30.625
<c.speaker>Hold on!

15:30.625 --> 15:32.125
<c.speaker>To what?

15:36.583 --> 15:39.333
<c.speaker>Yes! Told you
Maravilla was faster.

15:39.333 --> 15:41.458
<c.speaker>Ha! We're not
at the top yet!

15:41.458 --> 15:43.708
<c.speaker>Mm! Oh!

15:48.708 --> 15:51.083
<c.speaker>[gasps] A tamborita?

15:51.083 --> 15:53.083
<c.speaker>You know magic, too?

15:53.083 --> 15:54.833
<c.speaker>I'm taking lessons.

15:54.833 --> 15:57.291
<c.speaker>Watch me magically
get to the top.

15:57.291 --> 15:59.125
<c.speaker>Oh-ho, I don't think so!

15:59.125 --> 16:00.750
<c.speaker>[exclaims]

16:04.500 --> 16:05.625
<c.speaker>Uh-oh.

16:09.708 --> 16:11.583
<c.speaker>What did you do?

16:11.583 --> 16:13.583
<c.speaker>I was casting
a speed-up spell,

16:13.583 --> 16:17.250
<c.speaker>but, thanks to you,
I wound up saying
a wake-up spell!

16:18.958 --> 16:22.000
<c.speaker>[barking]

16:24.375 --> 16:26.708
<c.speaker>-What are those?
-Whoa!

16:26.708 --> 16:29.708
<c.speaker>-They're alive!
-Alive?!

16:29.708 --> 16:32.208
<c.speaker>[barking]

16:32.208 --> 16:35.333
<c.speaker>-[Valentina] Oh, no.
-Down boys, sit!

16:35.333 --> 16:36.458
<c.speaker>Uh, uh, stay!

16:43.166 --> 16:46.166
<c.speaker>Aah! He's catching up!

16:46.166 --> 16:48.291
<c.speaker>Xolo!

16:51.333 --> 16:56.250
<c.speaker>[all screaming]

16:56.250 --> 16:58.833
<c.speaker>Naomi, I apologize
for all the bad things

16:58.833 --> 17:00.875
<c.speaker>I have said
behind your back.

17:00.875 --> 17:04.083
<c.speaker>And I apologize
for the ones I said
to your face!

17:08.000 --> 17:09.750
<c.speaker>We have to move the tree.

17:09.750 --> 17:13.875
<c.speaker>[groaning]

17:13.875 --> 17:15.708
<c.speaker>No, I'll get it.

17:17.708 --> 17:19.208
<c.speaker>-Aah!
-[thud]

17:19.208 --> 17:21.500
<c.speaker>What is it with you?

17:21.500 --> 17:23.416
<c.speaker>What is it with me?

17:23.416 --> 17:25.500
<c.speaker>You're the one
who knocked my tamborita.

17:25.500 --> 17:28.583
<c.speaker>And you're the one
who turned a trail ride
into a horse race.

17:28.583 --> 17:31.000
<c.speaker>Why do you have to make
everything a competition?

17:31.000 --> 17:34.250
<c.speaker>So I can finally prove
that I'm just as good as you!

17:34.250 --> 17:36.750
<c.speaker>Just as good as me?

17:40.000 --> 17:43.291
<c.speaker>I heard stories
about you and Avalor,

17:43.291 --> 17:46.291
<c.speaker>and then I come here
and find out it's all true.

17:46.291 --> 17:50.208
<c.speaker>Your kingdom's amazing.
You are amazing.

17:51.625 --> 17:54.416
<c.speaker>I guess I felt
a little insecure,

17:54.416 --> 17:56.208
<c.speaker>so I wanted to impress you.

17:56.208 --> 17:59.000
<c.speaker>I'm-- I'm sorry.

18:00.083 --> 18:01.583
<c.speaker>I'm sorry, too.

18:01.583 --> 18:04.458
<c.speaker>I invited you here
so that we could become friends,

18:04.458 --> 18:08.250
<c.speaker>and instead I got caught up
in trying to one-up you.

18:08.250 --> 18:10.291
<c.speaker>Well, I didn't give
you much choice.

18:10.291 --> 18:13.750
<c.speaker>And the thing is,
it doesn't matter who's better.

18:13.750 --> 18:15.708
<c.speaker>All that matters
is that our friends

18:15.708 --> 18:17.625
<c.speaker>are in danger
and they need us!

18:21.583 --> 18:24.375
<c.speaker>Okay, let's move
this tree.

18:27.083 --> 18:29.166
<c.speaker>Wait, I have
a better idea!

18:29.166 --> 18:31.708
<c.speaker>I mean not better,
but, you know, easier.

18:31.708 --> 18:33.333
<c.speaker>Ever play fetch?

18:35.583 --> 18:38.458
<c.speaker>Now I know what
a chew toy feels like!

18:38.458 --> 18:41.250
<c.speaker>This is true!

18:41.250 --> 18:45.375
<c.speaker>[all screaming]

18:51.875 --> 18:54.166
<c.speaker>Whoa!

18:58.291 --> 19:00.000
<c.speaker>[whistles]

19:04.250 --> 19:05.958
<c.speaker>[barks]

19:07.500 --> 19:09.583
<c.speaker>Go fetch!

19:12.416 --> 19:13.500
<c.speaker>I'll get the carriage.

19:13.500 --> 19:14.833
<c.speaker>You take care of the Xolos.

19:14.833 --> 19:16.708
<c.speaker>You'll need this.

19:16.708 --> 19:17.750
<c.speaker>Thanks!

19:17.750 --> 19:18.875
<c.speaker>Hyah!

19:25.708 --> 19:27.375
<c.speaker>[grunts]

19:29.333 --> 19:31.000
<c.speaker>-Gabe!
-Elena?

19:31.000 --> 19:34.291
<c.speaker>Don't move!
Go, Canela.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.333
<c.speaker>Unh!

19:42.333 --> 19:43.750
<c.speaker>Aah!

19:43.750 --> 19:46.375
<c.speaker>[both laugh]
We're alive!

19:46.375 --> 19:48.500
<c.speaker>[clearing throats]

19:48.500 --> 19:50.166
<c.speaker>We will never speak
of this again.

19:50.166 --> 19:52.708
<c.speaker>I don't even know
what you're talking about.

19:52.708 --> 19:55.333
<c.speaker>[barking]

19:55.333 --> 19:56.583
<c.speaker>[yells curse]

20:05.958 --> 20:07.333
<c.speaker>Akatok!

20:17.375 --> 20:21.416
<c.speaker>[Valentina] Huh. I guess now
they'll always be connected.

20:28.333 --> 20:31.583
<c.speaker>With this treaty,
the Kingdoms of Avalor

20:31.583 --> 20:34.500
<c.speaker>and Paraíso
will always be friends.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.958
<c.speaker>And always protect
each other.

20:41.083 --> 20:42.458
<c.speaker>[laughing]

20:42.458 --> 20:44.458
<c.speaker>On second thought,
I'll use this one.

20:47.166 --> 20:48.958
<c.speaker>[cheering]

20:48.958 --> 20:50.708
<c.speaker>Now it's official.

20:52.166 --> 20:54.583
<c.speaker>Manuel, send word home
with the good news,

20:54.583 --> 20:56.583
<c.speaker>and tell them
to double the patrols.

20:56.583 --> 20:59.583
<c.speaker>Our friends
need our help.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.250
<c.speaker>According to the map,

21:03.250 --> 21:06.500
<c.speaker>Paraíso should be
just beyond this...

21:06.500 --> 21:08.458
<c.speaker>river.

21:08.458 --> 21:10.875
<c.speaker>[Shuriki]
So much for Paraíso,

21:10.875 --> 21:13.583
<c.speaker>and the only other jewel
that's powerful enough

21:13.583 --> 21:15.583
<c.speaker>will be impossible
to steal,

21:15.583 --> 21:18.083
<c.speaker>so we better
start planning.

21:18.083 --> 21:20.208
<c.speaker>But I thought you said
it was impossi--

21:20.208 --> 21:21.958
<c.speaker>Now!

21:21.958 --> 21:24.083
<c.speaker>Now, that's
more like it!

21:24.083 --> 21:25.708
<c.speaker>My picture is
as big as yours!

21:25.708 --> 21:27.625
<c.speaker>I'm just as wanted.

21:27.625 --> 21:29.083
<c.speaker>Ohh...

21:29.083 --> 21:31.833
<c.speaker>Hey, wait for me!

21:33.583 --> 21:36.416
<c.speaker>I have
a farewell gift for you.

21:36.416 --> 21:38.750
<c.speaker>Avaloran chocolate?

21:38.750 --> 21:41.583
<c.speaker>I've heard it's
the second-best in the world!

21:41.583 --> 21:43.458
<c.speaker>[chuckles]

21:43.458 --> 21:45.625
<c.speaker>I've heard it
doesn't matter.

21:45.625 --> 21:47.250
<c.speaker>See you soon.

21:47.250 --> 21:49.250
<c.speaker>I hope so.

21:49.250 --> 21:51.500
<c.speaker>[neighing]

21:56.583 --> 21:59.000
<c.speaker>Nah, Avaloran chocolate
is still better.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.500
<c.speaker>This is true.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.708
<c.speaker>♪♪
