WEBVTT

00:02.610 --> 00:05.160
we've got a killing team on a
mission. They're killing sinners.

00:05.195 --> 00:07.605
In control enough to do
complicated computer work.

00:07.640 --> 00:09.760
I'm pretty sure it's a video
of your mr. Carr being murdered.

00:09.795 --> 00:11.885
There's a video of this
murder posted on the internet?

00:11.920 --> 00:15.180
- Those 3 dogs attacked someone a couple of months ago.
- Think the owners are there?

00:15.215 --> 00:16.204
Hi.Mr.Hankel?

00:16.239 --> 00:20.070
There's a report that lists you as
calling 911. You were walking your dog.

00:20.105 --> 00:21.370
That's wrong. I don't have a dog.

00:21.405 --> 00:22.575
Jj,it's him!

00:22.610 --> 00:25.140
It's the guy,jj! He's the
unsub! He's in the barn. Come on.

00:25.175 --> 00:26.585
You cover the front.
I'll go around back.

00:26.620 --> 00:29.810
Hotch knows we're missing. He'll come
looking for us.We'll just wait tobias out.

00:30.820 --> 00:32.450
Jj!

00:32.930 --> 00:34.990
- I tried to warn everyone.
- Ok.

00:35.880 --> 00:37.105
Shoot him!

00:37.140 --> 00:40.470
Shoot him,you weakling. He's a satan.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074

00:57.360 --> 01:00.420
Johan, follow me. Take the Hotch and Gideon.

01:02.930 --> 01:05.150
I'm a man of wealth and taste
there's a barn around back.

01:05.185 --> 01:07.060
Prentiss,come on.

01:22.280 --> 01:23.710
Danm

01:23.745 --> 01:25.140
F.B.I.!

01:25.180 --> 01:26.865
- Jj!
- Don't move!

01:26.900 --> 01:29.200
Jj,it's morgan and
prentiss. Don't shoot.

01:29.235 --> 01:30.825
It's ok.

01:30.860 --> 01:32.900
Are you hurt?

01:33.260 --> 01:35.240
Tobias hankel is the unsub.

01:35.275 --> 01:36.305
Yeah,we know.

01:36.340 --> 01:38.480
- I'm calling an ambulance.
- Yeah

01:38.515 --> 01:40.620
We just thought he was a witness.

01:41.340 --> 01:43.560
- I had to kill them.
- Jj,where's reid?

01:43.595 --> 01:45.545
They just completely tore her apart.

01:45.580 --> 01:47.870
- There's nothing even
left- - jj,look at me.

01:47.905 --> 01:50.670
Look at me. Where's reid?

01:51.240 --> 01:53.960
We split up. He said he
was going to go in the back.

02:29.140 --> 02:31.430
House is clear.

02:32.160 --> 02:35.000
So where the hell is he?

02:49.870 --> 02:52.770
- hey,is there any sign of him yet?
- We got every one of our units on the road.

02:52.805 --> 02:55.080
He won't make it far.

02:55.720 --> 02:57.680
You can't find reid?

02:57.715 --> 02:59.577
Not yet.

02:59.612 --> 03:01.440
Prentiss.

03:02.560 --> 03:04.600
I think reid followed
him into the cornfield.

03:04.635 --> 03:06.680
It looks like somebody got dragged.

03:06.715 --> 03:08.575
Yeah. You sure?

03:08.610 --> 03:11.425
- We're on our way now.
- Hey,what's going on?

03:11.460 --> 03:15.660
The sheriff 2 towns over. He just gave
directions to a man who fit hankel's description.

03:15.695 --> 03:18.077
It's to a motor lodge in fort bend.

03:18.112 --> 03:20.460
- Let's get hotch and gideon.
- Yeah.

03:36.390 --> 03:38.510
why are we driving so far?

03:38.570 --> 03:42.480
Because if you want to feel close to
god,sometimes you got to make the journey.

03:42.920 --> 03:47.120
When you start hunting on your own,you
find yourself a place where you're at peace.

03:47.630 --> 03:50.150
It's a powerful thing,taking
an animal's life.

03:50.185 --> 03:52.592
You got to be right with yourself.

03:52.627 --> 03:55.000
But I don't want to kill anything.

03:55.590 --> 03:58.200
Stop that lip quivering and sit up.

03:58.235 --> 04:00.480
We're almost there.

04:16.860 --> 04:18.910
they're gone.

04:19.680 --> 04:21.394
Who are they?

04:21.430 --> 04:23.570
It's just me now.

04:23.605 --> 04:25.710
Who... who are you?

04:27.990 --> 04:30.620
I'm raphael.

04:33.900 --> 04:37.250
- What's that smell?
- They're burning fish hearts and livers.

04:37.285 --> 04:39.525
Keeps away the devil.

04:39.560 --> 04:42.700
They believe you can
see inside men's minds.

04:43.330 --> 04:46.220
It's not true. I study human behavior.

04:47.690 --> 04:50.980
I'm not interested in
the arguments of men.

04:53.010 --> 04:55.990
You know that this is?

04:56.140 --> 04:58.420
It's god's will.

05:04.890 --> 05:09.180
- You don't have to do this.
- Now go,sinners,to your god.

05:50.459 --> 05:55.109
There is not a righteous man on earth
who does what is right and never sins.

05:55.144 --> 05:57.659
Ecclesiastes 7:20.

06:04.209 --> 06:06.254
You know,they do have hotels in georgia.

06:06.289 --> 06:09.309
If we're going to figure out where tobias hankel
has taken reid,the answer is in this house.

06:09.344 --> 06:11.479
There's no sense splitting time
between here and a field office.

06:11.514 --> 06:12.154
Right.

06:12.189 --> 06:15.589
Think of the house as a witness. If
it could talk,what would it tell us?

06:17.369 --> 06:20.219
My guess is it would tell
us to get the hell out.

06:25.509 --> 06:27.284
Welcome to our nightmare.

06:27.319 --> 06:30.979
His computer is an extension of
his brain. I need you to dissect it.

06:31.014 --> 06:32.776
I'll get you set up. Come on.

06:32.811 --> 06:34.504
So,nothing new since I left?

06:34.539 --> 06:38.819
Well,the good thing is,the guy documented
practically every second of his life.

06:38.854 --> 06:40.984
The bad news is,we're still unpiling.

06:41.019 --> 06:43.744
From the looks of it,he hasn't
left this place in years.

06:43.779 --> 06:46.809
He knew he could pretend to be looking
for a motel and throw us off his trail.

06:46.844 --> 06:48.701
No,no,no. It's more than that.

06:48.736 --> 06:50.524
Sheriff's office,911 calls.

06:50.559 --> 06:53.339
Every time he engages the
police and gets away with it...

06:53.819 --> 06:56.054
he reassures himself

06:56.089 --> 06:58.289
god's on his side,

06:58.699 --> 07:00.579
not ours.

07:00.639 --> 07:03.264
Right out of the gate,the
guy's self-taught.

07:03.299 --> 07:06.474
His mainframe is totally
idiosyncratic,but it's pretty brilliant.

07:06.509 --> 07:09.669
Talk to me about what this son of a bitch
watches on-line. What the hell is all of this?

07:09.704 --> 07:13.634
It's tame stuff- video
games,software,sports.

07:13.669 --> 07:19.019
Seriously,if I had to guess whose system this
belongs to,I would say a crazy smart high-school kid.

07:19.054 --> 07:21.661
- Garcia,that doesn't make any sense.
- Well,that's what I've got.

07:21.696 --> 07:24.269
A mission-based killer like hankel
would need constant reassurance-

07:24.304 --> 07:26.619
religious manifesto,violent
images,something.

07:26.654 --> 07:28.929
Nothing,baby. Nothing.

07:29.119 --> 07:31.249
What about the mpegs of the
murders he posted on-line?

07:31.284 --> 07:33.129
Does he sit and watch
those over and over?

07:33.164 --> 07:35.024
- Ok,that's weird.
- What?Talk to me.

07:35.059 --> 07:39.469
They're not even here.All I have is a site he set up once he
commandeered people's webcams,and he keeps a running clock,

07:39.504 --> 07:43.779
and at a certain point,each one is
bookmarked with a different heading.

07:43.814 --> 07:45.259
"Adulterer,

07:45.294 --> 07:46.711
liar,

07:46.746 --> 07:48.094
thief.

07:48.129 --> 07:51.559
" This guy sits here for days and just watches
these people,and he waits for them to commit a sin.

07:51.594 --> 07:53.104
Yeah,but reid's completely innocent.

07:53.139 --> 07:56.119
If you dig deep enough on any of
us,we all have our sins,including reid.

07:56.439 --> 07:58.469
including reid.

08:04.989 --> 08:07.329
What are you staring at,boy?

08:12.059 --> 08:14.264
You're not raphael.

08:14.299 --> 08:16.469
Do I look like raphael?

08:23.089 --> 08:25.579
Thank you for burning those...

08:25.889 --> 08:27.424
keeping us safe.

08:27.459 --> 08:30.699
- Don't try to trick me.
- I would never try and trick you.

08:30.734 --> 08:33.058
- You're a liar.
- I'm not a liar.

08:33.438 --> 08:35.948
- Lying's a sin.
- I'm not a liar.

08:41.509 --> 08:44.299
This will be over quickly if
you just confess your sins.

08:44.334 --> 08:46.559
I'm not a sinner.

08:47.839 --> 08:50.079
We're all sinners.

08:52.869 --> 08:57.469
The lord spake unto moses saying,"speak unto all
the congregation of the children of the lord "

08:57.529 --> 09:02.669
and say unto them,ye shall be
holy,for I,the lord your god,am holy.

09:03.559 --> 09:06.089
- You know leviticus.
- I know every word of the bible.

09:06.124 --> 09:08.114
I can recite it for you.

09:08.149 --> 09:10.074
The devil knows how to read,too.

09:10.109 --> 09:11.964
I'm not a devil. I'm not a devil.

09:11.999 --> 09:13.799
I'm a man. My name is spencer reid,and I have a mother,and
I have a father just like you,and they taught me the bible.

09:13.834 --> 09:16.969
and I have a father,just like
you,and they taught me the bible.

09:17.004 --> 09:19.341
Let me just recite the bible.

09:19.376 --> 09:21.679
Time to confess,spencer reid.

09:24.889 --> 09:26.089
Confess.

09:26.124 --> 09:27.254
I...

09:27.289 --> 09:29.919
I don't have anything to confess.

09:34.439 --> 09:39.529
Hey,I have got a list of
narcotics anonymous meetings.

09:39.849 --> 09:42.189
Someone's name and
number is written on it,

09:42.224 --> 09:44.529
but this looks to be about 12 years old.

09:44.564 --> 09:47.239
Try it. There are no bad leads.

09:53.669 --> 09:55.284
Is that latin?

09:55.319 --> 09:57.939
Honora patrum tuum.

10:00.809 --> 10:03.829
"Honor thy father.

10:24.229 --> 10:27.089
" Hey,hey,hey. Jj,it's me.

10:27.819 --> 10:29.199
Are you all right?

10:29.234 --> 10:30.059
Uh... yeah.

10:31.319 --> 10:33.759
I'm sorry. You scared me.

10:34.159 --> 10:36.779
I'm sorry.

10:36.999 --> 10:41.849
I'm talking tomorrow morning to some guy
who knew hankel from narcotics anonymous.

10:41.884 --> 10:44.579
Why don't you come with
me,get out of the house?

10:45.099 --> 10:46.174
Yeah.

10:46.209 --> 10:48.209
Ok. Great.

10:48.329 --> 10:49.769
Emily.

10:50.089 --> 10:51.309
Yeah?

10:54.069 --> 10:56.929
How come none of this gets to you?

10:56.964 --> 10:58.314
What do you mean?

10:58.349 --> 11:00.604
You came off a desk job.

11:00.639 --> 11:05.749
Now suddenly you're in the field
surrounded by mutilated bodies,and...

11:06.589 --> 11:08.869
you don't even flinch.

11:09.439 --> 11:12.139
She's right. You've never blinked.

11:13.789 --> 11:15.834
I... guess...

11:15.869 --> 11:19.799
maybe i compartmentalize
better than most people.

11:21.029 --> 11:23.729
Hey,guys! I think I got something!

11:32.659 --> 11:34.469
Tobias hankel!

11:34.504 --> 11:36.279
F. B. I.!

11:51.159 --> 11:53.329
Tobias hankel.

11:53.719 --> 11:55.799
Tobias.

11:58.039 --> 12:00.609
I think we just found hankel's father.

12:11.689 --> 12:14.079
You need to eat.

12:14.929 --> 12:16.869
What's your name?

12:18.069 --> 12:19.759
Tobias.

12:20.289 --> 12:21.884
Tobias?

12:21.919 --> 12:23.924
Who was here before?

12:23.959 --> 12:26.399
It was probably my father.

12:30.489 --> 12:32.869
I'm sorry if he hurt you.

12:36.639 --> 12:38.779
What are you doing?

12:42.619 --> 12:43.904
Don'T.

12:43.939 --> 12:45.959
Please don'T.

12:46.549 --> 12:48.769
It helps.

12:50.969 --> 12:54.099
Don't tell my father. He
doesn't know they're here.

12:56.269 --> 12:58.749
Please. I don't want it.
I don't want it. Please.

12:58.784 --> 13:00.901
Trust me.

13:00.936 --> 13:03.019
I know.

13:11.429 --> 13:13.089
Spencer,please go to the other room.

13:13.124 --> 13:14.884
Don't treat him like a child.

13:14.919 --> 13:17.474
I'm not going to have this
conversation in front of him.

13:17.509 --> 13:20.709
Statistically,children who grow up in 2-parent households attain 3 more
years of higher education than children from single-parent households.

13:20.744 --> 13:24.429
attain 3 more years of higher education
than children from single-parent households.

13:24.464 --> 13:27.379
We're not statistics,spencer.

13:27.414 --> 13:29.034
I'm not crazy.

13:29.069 --> 13:31.849
If you refuse to take care
of yourself,I can't help you.

13:31.884 --> 13:33.699
I do take care of myself.

13:33.734 --> 13:35.829
What day is it?

13:39.409 --> 13:41.064
That's not fair.

13:41.099 --> 13:43.214
I'm out of ideas,diana.

13:43.249 --> 13:46.559
Well,you could take spencer
with you,just for a little while.

13:46.594 --> 13:49.699
- Don't do this.
- You're weak.

13:51.199 --> 13:53.529
You're right.

13:57.189 --> 13:59.269
Good-bye.

14:05.279 --> 14:07.549
I'm not weak.

14:07.584 --> 14:09.819
I know,honey.

14:11.069 --> 14:14.719
I'm not weak.

14:15.329 --> 14:16.799
I'm not weak.

14:17.069 --> 14:20.079
I don't give a damn whether
you're weak or strong.

14:21.839 --> 14:24.214
Yell all you want,boy.

14:24.249 --> 14:26.909
Ain't no one gonna
hear you where you are.

14:46.930 --> 14:51.080
The coroner put charles hankel's
death at approximately 6 months ago.

14:51.115 --> 14:53.060
Ok,that's got to be the stressor.

14:53.095 --> 14:53.895
Stressor?

14:53.930 --> 14:56.355
His father's death- it's
probably what set him off.

14:56.390 --> 15:01.140
What we need to do is focus on that time period,see what was going
on in his life,and maybe we can get a key to where he's hiding now.

15:03.450 --> 15:05.145
Tobias hankel.

15:05.180 --> 15:08.290
I haven't thought about that
boy in probably 10 years.

15:08.325 --> 15:10.445
So you two were in a program together?

15:10.480 --> 15:13.410
He should tell you,but
yeah,I was his sponsor.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.935
Small town. We all get lumped together.

15:15.970 --> 15:17.780
Me,I was just a drunk,but tobias,he
was a whole different sort of animal.

15:17.815 --> 15:21.420
but tobias,he was a whole
different sort of animal.

15:21.455 --> 15:24.040
So,what was tobias' drug of choice?

15:24.075 --> 15:25.245
Dilaudid.

15:25.280 --> 15:26.395
Drugstore heroin.

15:26.430 --> 15:28.770
He used to cut it with a psychedelic.

15:29.260 --> 15:33.545
That boy was looking to escape as
far from reality as he could get.

15:33.580 --> 15:36.130
Addicts don't get excuses,but if someone
ever needed to self-medicate,it was that boy.

15:36.165 --> 15:40.460
but if someone ever needed to
self-medicate,it was that boy.

15:40.495 --> 15:44.230
- Why is that?
- You know anything about his daddy?

15:45.010 --> 15:48.300
We think tobias hankel may
have murdered his father.

15:48.335 --> 15:50.260
Good for him.

15:50.720 --> 15:55.005
You know,tobias' mama ran off
with another man when he was 7.

15:55.040 --> 15:56.990
His dad went section-eight,started
preaching about sin,end-of-the-world stuff.

15:57.025 --> 16:00.620
started preaching about
sin,end-of-the-world stuff.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.285
He beat tobias silly.

16:03.320 --> 16:07.230
He burned a cross in his
forehead when tobias was 10.

16:07.265 --> 16:09.695
If tobias wore a hat,he beat him more.

16:09.730 --> 16:12.880
Is there anyone tobias would
turn to if he was on the run?

16:12.915 --> 16:15.275
As far as I know,he never left home.

16:15.310 --> 16:19.140
You know,honestly,between
his habit and the old man,

16:19.360 --> 16:21.650
I'm amazed he's still alive.

16:24.150 --> 16:25.685
There's something weird going on here.

16:25.720 --> 16:28.115
- You think?
- No,seriously. Check this out.

16:28.150 --> 16:30.510
This journal is filled
with religious ramblings.

16:30.545 --> 16:32.312
He notates hour by hour.

16:32.347 --> 16:34.045
"November
15th,3:17-

16:34.080 --> 16:37.115
if ye offer a sacrifice of peace

16:37.150 --> 16:39.340
offering unto the lord,ye
shall offer it at your own will.

16:39.375 --> 16:44.130
" And it goes on and
on. 5:04,7:41,10:22,1:42.

16:44.570 --> 16:46.825
But then it goes blank for days.

16:46.860 --> 16:49.045
Maybe he got sick of writing.

16:49.080 --> 16:51.085
- I think I got it.
- What is it?

16:51.120 --> 16:53.155
Journal entry- "december
6th. Father sick.

16:53.190 --> 16:55.830
"Wants me to put him down.
"I say,"thou shalt not kill.

16:55.865 --> 16:58.720
He says,honor thy father.
Must pray for guidance.

16:58.755 --> 17:00.715
" So he kills his father
as an act of mercy?

17:00.750 --> 17:04.369
This is 2 months ago. Tobias hankel's
father had been dead for 4 months already.

17:04.405 --> 17:06.252
That's exactly it.

17:06.287 --> 17:08.065
Look at the floor.

17:08.099 --> 17:10.640
These scuff marks are fresh.

17:10.920 --> 17:14.839
I mean,it's like 2 people were moving the
chairs constantly,trying to fight for control.

17:14.875 --> 17:15.694
So?

17:15.730 --> 17:19.375
This journal matches charles hankel's
handwriting. But it was written after he died.

17:19.410 --> 17:24.490
Upstairs,tobias' bedroom- it's got junk piled from floor to
ceiling,but the other bedroom could pass a military inspection.

17:24.525 --> 17:29.055
So are you telling me one of
tobias' personalities was his father?

17:29.090 --> 17:34.490
Well,tobias was raised with a strict religious
code- black and white,right and wrong.

17:34.525 --> 17:38.760
When his father asked tobias to
kill him,something had to give.

17:38.795 --> 17:40.885
His brain couldn't handle
the moral contradiction,

17:40.920 --> 17:44.380
so it split into 2 personalities
in order to keep his father alive.

17:44.850 --> 17:47.205
So... who is raphael?

17:47.240 --> 17:49.740
My guess-he's a
mediator between the two.

17:49.775 --> 17:51.925
Angels have no human emotions.

17:51.960 --> 17:55.965
Live or die,they don't care,as
long as it's god's will.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.750
We need to start profiling tobias' father. He
may be the one who chose where to take reid.

17:59.785 --> 18:01.970
I'll get garcia on it.

18:02.890 --> 18:05.675
Garcia,I need you to log into
the system as tobias' father.

18:05.710 --> 18:08.425
The system was set up 3 months
ago. Dad was already dead.

18:08.460 --> 18:10.900
I know that,smarty-pants,but do
it for your boy anyway,all right?

18:10.935 --> 18:11.665
Ok.

18:11.700 --> 18:13.760
Charles hankel.

18:25.520 --> 18:26.740
Oh.

18:28.560 --> 18:31.495
- Are you ready,boy?
- Ready for what?

18:31.530 --> 18:35.210
My weakling son thinks god
gave you to him for a reason.

18:36.600 --> 18:39.210
Let's see if we're both right.

18:53.830 --> 18:55.565
Any luck with the rehab contact?

18:55.600 --> 18:57.595
Well,he has no idea
where hankel might be,

18:57.630 --> 19:01.510
but we did learn that he has a
serious drug problem- dilaudid.

19:01.545 --> 19:03.855
Well,that could explain
the psychotic fracture.

19:03.890 --> 19:08.030
- What are you talking about? - Tobias
is living as at least 3 different people-

19:08.065 --> 19:10.527
himself,raphael,

19:10.562 --> 19:12.990
and his father.

19:13.970 --> 19:18.160
This could be some bad news. A computer
store was robbed in the middle of the night.

19:18.195 --> 19:20.225
A suburb outside of atlanta.

19:20.260 --> 19:22.270
The thief got away with 4 laptops,

19:22.305 --> 19:24.100
external hard drives,

19:24.135 --> 19:25.195
and a satellite.

19:25.230 --> 19:28.350
If it's tobias,it puts
him right back in business.

19:32.100 --> 19:35.150
- What happened?
- I don't know.

19:37.810 --> 19:39.785
Oh,my god.

19:39.820 --> 19:42.260
Guys! Guys! Get in here!

19:48.030 --> 19:50.205
He's been beaten. Can't you track him?

19:50.240 --> 19:53.000
Hankel's only streaming
this to his home computer.

19:53.540 --> 19:57.225
This is for us. He knows we're herE.

19:57.260 --> 20:00.005
- I'm gonna put this guy's head on a stick.
- Why can't you locate him?

20:00.040 --> 20:04.400
He's rerouting to a different I. P.
Address every 30 seconds. I can't track him.

20:05.730 --> 20:08.980
Can you really see inside men's minds?

20:09.090 --> 20:11.710
See these vermin?

20:12.350 --> 20:16.080
Choose one to die. I'll
let you choose one to live.

20:16.115 --> 20:17.075
No.

20:17.110 --> 20:19.735
I thought you wanted to
be some kind of savior.

20:19.770 --> 20:24.030
You're a sadist and a psychotic break. You
won't stop killing. Your word's not true.

20:25.180 --> 20:27.215
The other heathens are watching.

20:27.250 --> 20:31.290
Choose a sinner to die,and I'll say the
name and address of the person to be saved.

20:35.190 --> 20:39.760
I won't get choose who gets slaughtered and have
you leave their remains behind like a poacher.

20:41.680 --> 20:44.560
Can you really see into my mind,boy?

20:44.595 --> 20:47.585
Can you see I'm not a liar?!

20:47.620 --> 20:51.290
Choose one to die,and save a
life. Otherwise,they're all dead.

20:54.030 --> 20:58.130
- All right,i'll choose who lives.
- They're all the same.

21:06.150 --> 21:08.775
Far right screen.

21:08.810 --> 21:13.010
Marilyn david,4913 walnut creek road.

21:13.340 --> 21:15.670
- You got that?
- Yeah.

21:21.330 --> 21:22.245
Hello.

21:22.280 --> 21:25.510
Marilyn david,my name is jason
gideon. I'm with the F. B. I.

21:25.545 --> 21:28.070
What?

21:33.760 --> 21:36.420
Raphael.

21:46.800 --> 21:48.930
You've done your part.

21:48.965 --> 21:51.990
Now it's my turn.

21:55.050 --> 21:59.110
So now what? Wait for a 911
call,and hope we get there in time?

22:03.660 --> 22:06.290
- Red or white?
- White.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.250
All right.

22:21.170 --> 22:23.120
Honey,did you leave the drawer open?

22:42.190 --> 22:43.870
- 911. What's your emergency?
- 3514 leavenworth.

22:46.230 --> 22:50.090
Raphael has killed them before
their lies can free more sinners.

23:06.045 --> 23:08.175
Thanks,D. C.

23:13.255 --> 23:15.640
Slaughtered,same as the others.

23:15.675 --> 23:20.245
We've got roadblocks for a 15-mile radius.
Every unit's on the road. But so far nothing.

23:20.280 --> 23:22.415
I don't know how much
longer reid can hold out.

23:22.450 --> 23:25.555
Who were the victims?
Pam and mike hayes.

23:25.590 --> 23:28.140
He was a local defense attorney.

23:28.175 --> 23:32.715
- And what bible passage was left?
- Isaiah 59.

23:32.995 --> 23:37.195
"No one calls for justice,"no one
pleads their case with integrity.

23:37.230 --> 23:40.362
They rely on empty
arguments,they utter lies

23:40.397 --> 23:43.495
they conceive trouble
and give birth to evil.

23:43.530 --> 23:46.160
Reid,if you're watching,

23:46.195 --> 23:49.475
you're not respensible
for this.you understand me?

23:49.535 --> 23:52.475
He's perverting god to justify murder.

23:52.510 --> 23:54.525
You are stronger than him.

23:54.560 --> 23:57.455
He cannot break you.

24:03.235 --> 24:05.885
I thought you were going
to try and get some rest.

24:06.305 --> 24:09.995
Everybody else is
working. I should be,too.

24:10.485 --> 24:12.705
We can handle it.

24:13.955 --> 24:16.075
It's funny. I keep thinking...

24:16.395 --> 24:19.975
the one thing we need to
crack this case is,uh...

24:20.235 --> 24:22.915
well,reid.

24:22.950 --> 24:24.875
Yeah.

24:25.535 --> 24:28.745
You think reid and i should have
stayed together at the barn,don't you?

24:30.315 --> 24:32.330
Jj,go get some rest.

24:32.365 --> 24:34.720
I can tell that's what
you're thinking,so...

24:34.755 --> 24:37.040
- I just want to get reid home safe.
- But...

24:37.075 --> 24:42.215
if I had his back,like I was
supposed to,he'd be here now.

24:42.565 --> 24:45.355
- Jj,what do you want from me?
- I just... I want...

24:45.390 --> 24:48.640
someone to tell me the truth.

24:48.675 --> 24:51.605
The truth is one of you is
here,and one of you isn'T.

24:51.640 --> 24:55.525
You got to figure the
rest out for yoursF.

24:57.885 --> 24:59.890
We're not getting any closer.

24:59.925 --> 25:02.965
Reid's brilliant. He'll
figure out how to survive.

25:03.755 --> 25:05.880
You know,I always take
advantage of reid for his brain,

25:05.915 --> 25:09.965
but I never actually teach him how
to deal with things emotionally.

25:10.145 --> 25:13.515
- Lead by example.
- What kind of example is that?

25:15.255 --> 25:17.855
He'll make it.

25:27.505 --> 25:29.505
Tobias.

25:30.035 --> 25:32.350
Sorry. I had to leave for a while.

25:32.385 --> 25:35.995
You can leave again,and
you can take me with you.

25:36.205 --> 25:39.395
- My father would be angry.
- Not if he can't find us.

25:39.430 --> 25:42.585
- He always finds me.
- If you tell me where we are,

25:42.620 --> 25:46.375
my friends will
come,and they'll save us.

25:49.525 --> 25:52.290
We can't be saved.

25:52.325 --> 25:56.275
We can. We can. I promise. If you
tell me where we are,I'll save us both.

25:56.310 --> 25:59.645
Listen to me. It's not worth fighting.

26:01.155 --> 26:05.015
Tell me it doesn't make it better.

26:15.355 --> 26:16.410
Mom.

26:16.445 --> 26:20.215
- What is it,baby?
- It's the afternoon.

26:20.250 --> 26:21.730
I'm resting.

26:21.765 --> 26:24.875
The doctor says you
need to get out of bed.

26:24.910 --> 26:26.500
I've been reading.

26:26.535 --> 26:29.755
He says you need exercise.

26:30.585 --> 26:35.195
Well,that's because his idea of good
literature is "our bodies,our selves.

26:35.375 --> 26:39.405
- Well,he's your doctor.
- He's a neanderthal.

26:41.985 --> 26:44.995
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to see if jeff wants to play.

26:45.030 --> 26:47.785
Come here. Let me read to you.

26:47.820 --> 26:49.955
Up,up.

26:54.605 --> 26:56.725
Pick one.

26:57.975 --> 26:59.820
that one.

26:59.855 --> 27:01.630
Proust.

27:01.665 --> 27:04.165
Beautiful choice.

27:05.585 --> 27:08.840
"The smell of the madeleine

27:08.875 --> 27:12.095
unleashing the flood of memory.

27:15.245 --> 27:19.345
"for a long time,I
used to go to bed early.

27:19.380 --> 27:23.445
"Sometimes,when I had put out my candle,

27:23.480 --> 27:26.200
my eyes would close so quickly

27:26.235 --> 27:29.935
that I had not even
time to say to myself,

27:30.285 --> 27:33.305
I'm falling asleep.

27:46.745 --> 27:49.250
" Any more sign of reid?

27:49.285 --> 27:52.210
And he just posted the
last murder on-line.

27:52.245 --> 27:54.995
It's had over 17,000 hits
in the first 20 minutes.

27:55.030 --> 27:56.900
- I want to see it.
- No,you don'T.

27:56.935 --> 27:59.925
Don't tell me what I
want and don't want.

28:04.595 --> 28:07.025
If I can't watch this...

28:07.605 --> 28:09.725
I have no business being in the field.

28:09.760 --> 28:11.872
Jj,it's not a competition.

28:11.907 --> 28:13.950
I... I need to see it.

28:13.985 --> 28:17.195
If you stop being
affected by things,you...

28:17.230 --> 28:20.375
lose parts of yourself,you know.

28:21.165 --> 28:23.345
Show me.

28:25.835 --> 28:27.805
I won't watch it with you.

28:27.840 --> 28:30.140
3514 leavenworth.

28:30.175 --> 28:33.755
Raphael has killed them before
their lies can free more sinners.

28:35.205 --> 28:37.770
We can trace their whole family history.

28:37.805 --> 28:40.230
Here we got happy,smiling
pictures of tobias.

28:40.265 --> 28:43.425
Report cards all a's and b's,but
at 8 years old,we got nothing.

28:43.460 --> 28:44.910
That's his mother leaving.

28:44.945 --> 28:46.920
6 months later,on the
other side of the board,

28:46.955 --> 28:49.700
we have a form from child
services saying they paid a visit.

28:49.735 --> 28:54.065
Then charles starts keeping journals about punishing
sinners and needing to remove the devil from his son.

28:54.100 --> 28:57.487
Which corresponds to tobias'
drug use. He's trying to escape.

28:57.522 --> 29:00.875
So wherever reid is,it was
tobias' choice,not his father'S.

29:00.910 --> 29:03.160
- How do you figure?
- Look at these 2 lives.

29:03.195 --> 29:06.475
They're like inverse graphs. One's getting
weaker while the other one's getting angrier.

29:06.510 --> 29:09.065
Tobias would run away. His father
would have stood and fought.

29:09.100 --> 29:12.500
Ok,so tobias uses drugs as an escape.

29:12.535 --> 29:16.875
I'll go back through the journals and see if I can
find anything connecting his drug use to a hiding place.

29:17.165 --> 29:18.890
Uh... where's gideon?

29:18.925 --> 29:21.465
He's upstairs.Why? What's going on?

29:21.500 --> 29:23.970
Hankel just posted the latest murder.

29:24.005 --> 29:26.825
I don't understand.Why can't we shut it
down?Because I can't pioint his I.P.F.

29:26.860 --> 29:29.395
- Just remove it once he sends it.
- It's the internet,sir.

29:29.430 --> 29:31.355
Once something's out there,you
can never take it back.

29:31.390 --> 29:33.640
It must remain. You can't undo anything.

29:33.675 --> 29:36.850
Can you please do something,anything? I
do not want him thinking he has a pulpit.

29:36.885 --> 29:40.885
I have a list of everyone from the file-sharing chain. I could
send out a mass warning that the video is actually a virus.

29:40.920 --> 29:43.315
I'm gonna do that. Ok.

29:45.425 --> 29:46.345
No.

29:46.535 --> 29:48.275
No!

29:48.985 --> 29:51.340
They're trying to silence my message.

29:51.375 --> 29:54.105
I can't control what they do.
I'm not with them.I'm with you.

29:54.140 --> 29:57.155
Really?

29:58.195 --> 30:00.710
Reid,if you're watching,

30:00.745 --> 30:03.945
you're not responsible for
this. You understand me?

30:04.115 --> 30:07.025
He's perverting god to justify murder.

30:07.060 --> 30:09.035
You are stronger than him.

30:09.070 --> 30:11.495
He cannot break you.

30:16.875 --> 30:19.230
Do you think you can defy me?

30:19.265 --> 30:22.615
- I don't know what he's talking about.
- You're a liar!

30:28.305 --> 30:31.330
You're pitiful!

30:31.365 --> 30:34.355
Just like my son.

30:35.895 --> 30:38.445
This ends now.

30:38.995 --> 30:41.425
Confess your sins.

30:45.145 --> 30:48.675
- Confess!
- I haven't done anything.

30:55.485 --> 30:58.895
- Tobias,help mE.
- He can't hp you.He's weak.

30:58.930 --> 31:01.055
Tobias.

31:10.405 --> 31:12.525
Confess your sins.

31:12.560 --> 31:13.825
Help.

31:22.255 --> 31:24.385
oh my god.He's killing him.

31:32.825 --> 31:36.145
It's the devil vacating your body.

31:43.602 --> 31:46.372
You was a sinner.

31:49.282 --> 31:52.142
You haven't proven that.

31:53.252 --> 31:55.577
They all are in the end.

31:55.612 --> 31:57.902
You did the right thing.

31:59.712 --> 32:03.452
You had to stop the video.You did
the right thing.There's no question.

32:03.487 --> 32:06.612
God gave him to me for a reason.

32:08.122 --> 32:11.782
Your work is done.

32:15.002 --> 32:16.922
I can save him.

32:16.957 --> 32:19.327
How?

32:19.362 --> 32:22.452
By breathing a killer's
breath into his body?

32:32.482 --> 32:34.962
JasoN.

32:57.552 --> 32:58.767
Wait. Wait a second.

32:58.802 --> 33:01.872
- When was the video of the last murder posted?
- 9:23.

33:01.907 --> 33:03.487
And what was the time of death?

33:03.522 --> 33:07.252
The 911 call came in at 9:04,and the
murder must have been moments later.

33:07.287 --> 33:08.947
That's only a 19-minute difference.

33:08.982 --> 33:10.797
How long would it take to post the mpeg?

33:10.832 --> 33:12.577
- 2 or 3 minutes.
- Let's call it 2.

33:12.612 --> 33:14.997
You figure a maximum of 60 miles
an hour in a residential area.

33:15.032 --> 33:18.202
That means hankel has to be within
a 17-mile radius of the crime scene.

33:18.237 --> 33:21.002
Garcia,can we see it on a map?

33:22.052 --> 33:25.562
Call farraday. I want that area
locked down like it's martial law.

33:25.597 --> 33:28.502
Guys.

33:31.542 --> 33:33.892
You came back to life.

33:33.927 --> 33:35.757
Raphael.

33:35.792 --> 33:38.222
There can be only one of two reasons.

33:38.257 --> 33:40.097
I was given C.P.R.

33:40.132 --> 33:43.562
There are no accidents.How
many members are on your team?

33:43.572 --> 33:44.717
7.

33:44.752 --> 33:49.022
The 7 angels who had the 7 trumpets
prepared themselves to sound.

33:49.622 --> 33:52.562
The first sounding followed hail

33:52.597 --> 33:55.467
and they were thrown to earth.

33:55.502 --> 33:59.792
He thinks it's revelations- the 7
archangels versus the 7 angels of death.

34:05.282 --> 34:08.462
- Tell me who you serve.
- I serve you.

34:08.712 --> 34:12.007
- Then choose one to die.
- What?

34:12.042 --> 34:15.532
Your team members-
choose one to die.

34:16.022 --> 34:17.277
Kill me.

34:17.312 --> 34:20.181
- You said you weren't one of them.
- I lied.

34:20.217 --> 34:22.992
Your team has 6 other members.

34:23.212 --> 34:25.871
Tell me who dies.

34:26.331 --> 34:28.762
No.

34:36.822 --> 34:40.081
Choose,and prove you'll do god's will.

34:42.262 --> 34:44.262
No.

34:48.331 --> 34:50.532
Choose.

34:51.192 --> 34:53.842
I won't do it.

34:54.532 --> 34:56.581
Life is a choice.

34:56.617 --> 34:59.162
No.

35:01.272 --> 35:03.712
Choose.

35:07.172 --> 35:08.707
I...

35:08.742 --> 35:11.762
I choose... aaron hotch.

35:14.542 --> 35:17.007
He's a classic narcissist.

35:17.042 --> 35:19.642
He thinks he's better than
everyone else on the team.

35:19.677 --> 35:22.317
Genesis 23:4.

35:22.352 --> 35:24.902
"Let him not deceive himself "and trust in
emptiness,vanity,falseness,and futility,for these shall be his recompense.

35:24.937 --> 35:28.792
in emptiness,vanity,falseness,and
futility,

35:28.827 --> 35:32.392
for these shall be his recompense.

35:42.262 --> 35:45.692
For god's will.

35:51.202 --> 35:53.862
- I'm not a narcissist.
- Come on. Look. You can't think anything from that.

35:53.897 --> 35:56.287
- He's not in his right mind,hotch.
- No.Stop.Stop.

35:56.322 --> 35:59.252
All right,everybody right
now- what's my worst quality?

36:01.722 --> 36:03.812
Ok.I'll start. I have no sense of humor.

36:03.847 --> 36:06.137
- You're a bully.
- I'm a bully.

36:06.172 --> 36:08.162
- You can be a drill sergeant sometimes.
- Right.

36:08.197 --> 36:10.117
- You don't trust women as much as men.
- Ok,good.

36:10.152 --> 36:13.902
I'm all these things,but none of you said that I
ever put myself above the team,because I don't,ever.

36:13.937 --> 36:16.367
Reid and I argued about the
definition of classic narcissism,

36:16.402 --> 36:22.502
and he knew that I would remember that,and he
also quoted genesis,chapter 23,verse 4.Read it.

36:22.537 --> 36:24.277
"I am a stranger and
a sojourner with you."

36:24.312 --> 36:28.492
Give me property,forbear a place among you
that I may bury my dead out of my sight.

36:28.527 --> 36:30.972
" He wouldn't get it wrong
unless it was on purpose.

36:31.007 --> 36:32.687
He's in a cemetery.

36:32.722 --> 36:36.582
- I don't see a cemetery.
- Call up the first time we saw reid.

36:37.662 --> 36:42.592
I won't choose who gets slaughtered and have
you leave their remains behind like a poacher.

36:43.262 --> 36:46.172
Check to see if there are any reports
of poaching in the last couple of days.

36:46.207 --> 36:48.127
Ok. Uh...

36:48.162 --> 36:50.812
a farmer reported 2 sheep being
slaughtered on his property.

36:50.847 --> 36:53.172
Where are we talking?

36:54.432 --> 36:56.662
- What's that patch of green there?
- Marshall parish.

36:56.697 --> 36:58.157
- I think it's an old plantation.
- Wait.

36:58.192 --> 37:03.182
Tobias wrote in his journals about staying
clean and keeping away from marshall.

37:04.002 --> 37:07.302
Guys,there's a cemetery on the grounds.

37:12.522 --> 37:15.372
Tobias,is that you?

37:20.682 --> 37:23.262
Thank you.

37:24.692 --> 37:27.572
You saved my life.

37:31.442 --> 37:33.262
I'm sorry.

37:33.297 --> 37:35.402
Why?

37:35.802 --> 37:39.172
He'll win in the end.

37:41.882 --> 37:44.592
Tobias,I need to know
something. It's important.

37:44.627 --> 37:46.942
Are we in a cemetery?

37:47.362 --> 37:49.032
Yeah.

37:51.432 --> 37:54.122
I used to come here to get high.

37:54.492 --> 37:57.257
I was righT.

37:57.292 --> 38:00.117
No one bothers you here.

38:00.152 --> 38:02.982
I never told anyone about it.

38:14.812 --> 38:17.077
What are these men doing here?

38:17.112 --> 38:20.102
They're from a hospital.
They're here to help.

38:20.712 --> 38:23.527
I don't need help,and you can't
be here without permission.

38:23.562 --> 38:26.342
and you can't be here without
permission. Tell them,spencer.

38:28.292 --> 38:30.692
I called them.

38:31.812 --> 38:34.282
Spencer.

38:34.852 --> 38:38.302
- I'm doing this for you.
- This isn't legal.

38:38.337 --> 38:41.752
Your son's 18,ma'am. He
can act in your welfare.

38:43.192 --> 38:45.952
You need help.

38:50.512 --> 38:52.982
I want to stay here.

38:53.017 --> 38:55.722
I'm sorry.

38:57.032 --> 38:59.112
Please,these are my things.

38:59.147 --> 39:01.482
This is my life.

39:08.542 --> 39:09.727
I'm sorry.

39:09.762 --> 39:13.602
Spencer,please don't do this to me.

39:16.192 --> 39:19.142
I'm so sorry.

39:21.022 --> 39:23.297
I'm so sorry.

39:23.332 --> 39:26.522
What are you sorry for,boy?

39:26.557 --> 39:28.912
I sent her away.

39:28.947 --> 39:30.859
Who?

39:30.894 --> 39:32.737
My mom.

39:32.772 --> 39:34.417
I couldn'T...

39:34.452 --> 39:36.812
I couldn't help her.

39:37.612 --> 39:40.432
Is that a confession?

39:45.652 --> 39:47.857
I confess.

39:47.892 --> 39:51.287
You know your bible. Exodus 21:17.

39:51.322 --> 39:54.682
"And he that curseth his father

39:54.717 --> 39:56.982
or his mother...

39:58.222 --> 40:01.112
shall surely be put to death.

40:28.942 --> 40:31.712
" Grab a shovel.

40:41.227 --> 40:43.807
I ought to bury you alive in there,

40:44.507 --> 40:47.042
give you time to think
about what you done.

40:47.077 --> 40:50.537
- I know what I've done.
- Don't talk back to me.

40:51.577 --> 40:53.737
Dig.

41:01.987 --> 41:03.862
Go!

41:03.897 --> 41:05.737
F.B.I.!

41:06.787 --> 41:08.337
Clear.

41:08.637 --> 41:10.267
Clear.

41:11.177 --> 41:13.477
Oh! What's that smell?

41:13.687 --> 41:16.077
Let's spread out.They have
to be on foot.Let's go!

41:24.537 --> 41:27.347
What are you stopping for?

41:43.177 --> 41:45.222
Dig faster!

41:45.257 --> 41:49.087
- I'm not strong enough.
- You're all weak!

41:51.157 --> 41:54.257
Get out of there.

41:58.237 --> 42:01.027
Only one bullet in that gun,boy.

42:04.867 --> 42:06.977
Reid!

42:08.167 --> 42:10.777
Over there.

42:14.997 --> 42:17.477
You killed him.

42:17.512 --> 42:19.337
Tobias?

42:22.547 --> 42:25.557
Do you think I'll get
to see my mom again?

42:26.287 --> 42:29.297
I'm sorry.

42:37.607 --> 42:39.717
Reid.

42:45.477 --> 42:47.582
You all right?

42:47.617 --> 42:51.377
I knew you'd understanD.

42:59.627 --> 43:03.087
I'm so sorry.

43:04.257 --> 43:07.567
It's all right. It wasn't your fault.

43:11.157 --> 43:14.477
Let's get you out of here.

43:25.477 --> 43:27.027
Come on.

43:27.062 --> 43:28.577
Please...

43:29.147 --> 43:31.957
can I have a second alone?
