11:42.702 --> 11:45.536
- You talk about this house
like it's alive.

11:45.605 --> 11:47.538
(floorboards creak)

11:51.478 --> 11:52.944
What?

11:52.946 --> 11:54.946
- The wallpaper.

11:55.015 --> 11:57.048
- Uh, what about it?

11:57.183 --> 11:59.584
- It's underneath it.

11:59.586 --> 12:01.986
Derek thought he could
just cover it up.

12:02.122 --> 12:04.088
Like I could forget
it was there.

12:07.293 --> 12:10.228
<i>I don't know what killed derek,</i>
<i> but...</i>

12:10.297 --> 12:12.596
It wasn't an accident.

12:15.102 --> 12:17.368

12:21.608 --> 12:23.874

12:26.980 --> 12:30.114
(ripping intensifies)

12:32.452 --> 12:39.390
♪♪♪

12:40.527 --> 12:42.260
- (exhales)

12:45.665 --> 12:47.164
Oh, my god.

12:54.207 --> 12:55.974
<i> - Maybe you could, uh,</i>

12:56.109 --> 12:58.676
See about getting some
sleeping pills.

12:58.745 --> 13:01.145
- No, dad, that would interfere
with your other medication.

13:01.148 --> 13:03.381
- I didn't mean for me.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.550
I heard you last night on
that couch. You were tossing

13:05.685 --> 13:07.952
And turning something terrible.
- (pills clatter) sh...

13:08.021 --> 13:09.788
- Are you having
the bad dreams again?

13:09.923 --> 13:12.557
- No, I'm-I'm good.
- Are you sure?

13:12.692 --> 13:14.358
'cause you seem a little bit,

13:14.427 --> 13:16.760
I don't know what's the word,
jittery?

13:16.797 --> 13:19.564
- Oh, come on, jenny.
Okay, there we go.

13:19.633 --> 13:23.300
Um, see? That's why I, uh,
I quit coffee.

13:23.436 --> 13:25.303
<i> Okay. Um...</i>

13:25.305 --> 13:27.672
You ready for this?

13:27.807 --> 13:28.840
- Well, I'm not thrilled
to talk

13:28.909 --> 13:30.909
To a crown attorney
at any time,

13:30.911 --> 13:32.911
<i> But you know, if you think</i>
<i> it's a good idea we do it,</i>

13:32.913 --> 13:34.645
Then we do it.

13:34.681 --> 13:37.315
- Yeah, yeah.
I mean, clark, he uh...

13:37.384 --> 13:39.584
He's got a reputation
for being fair.

13:39.653 --> 13:42.720
I've worked with him and uh...

13:42.789 --> 13:44.789
You know, I think it's better
that we, we face this,

13:44.791 --> 13:48.393
Rather than hide.
(loud knock)

13:48.528 --> 13:50.662
(exhales) okay.

13:50.664 --> 13:52.696
- You say you found katie
at the bottom of the stairs.

13:54.835 --> 13:57.135
- Yeah.

13:57.270 --> 13:58.336
- Because the pictures from
the scene--

13:58.338 --> 13:59.938
- Oh, hey, you can't show him
those.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.672
- Of course not, but...

14:01.708 --> 14:04.141
They show katie several feet
from the stairs,

14:04.177 --> 14:06.611
Almost like she fell over
the railing.

14:08.815 --> 14:10.614
- Well, the paramedics
could've moved her

14:10.616 --> 14:12.050
<i> When they were trying</i>
<i> to resuscitate her.</i>

14:12.052 --> 14:15.954
- I'm... I'm asking him.
- Ask me. Um, well, she fell.

14:15.956 --> 14:17.822
That's, I mean,
that's what happened.

14:17.824 --> 14:20.625
- Okay, but from the top step,
or over the railing?

14:20.627 --> 14:22.493
- I don't understand what
you're really asking me?

14:22.562 --> 14:25.296
Are you saying, was I there
when she fell or...?

14:25.431 --> 14:28.299
- Gordon, I'm asking you
if she fell from the top step

14:28.434 --> 14:30.869
Or over the railing?
That's what I'm asking you.

14:32.839 --> 14:34.839
It is a simple question, gordon.

14:34.841 --> 14:36.507
<i> Top step, or over the railing?</i>
<i> Which one?</i>

14:36.576 --> 14:38.576
- Okay, hey, let's just,
let's take a minute.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.311
<i> Let's just take a break</i>
<i> for a second, okay?</i>

14:40.313 --> 14:41.880
- Let's just finish
my questions.

14:42.015 --> 14:43.982
- Well, he was asked all of
these questions 30 years ago

14:44.117 --> 14:45.650
<i> By the police.</i>
<i> - And he will be, again,</i>

14:45.785 --> 14:47.218
Unless you let me finish
talking to him.

14:47.353 --> 14:48.852
- Are you accusing him
of something?

14:48.889 --> 14:50.254
<i> - (loud bang) okay,</i>
<i> that's enough!</i>

14:50.290 --> 14:52.256
How dare you March into
this house

14:52.325 --> 14:55.192
And dredge up the past
like this?

14:55.194 --> 14:58.595
I lost my little girl!
She lost her sister!

14:58.732 --> 15:00.198
<i> Do you understand that?</i>

15:00.200 --> 15:02.266
<i> And you come in here and you</i>
<i> start picking over the bones</i>

15:02.302 --> 15:04.868
<i> Like some... Damn vulture.</i>

15:11.144 --> 15:12.810
<i> - Okay.</i>

15:14.748 --> 15:16.981
I've got everything I need.

15:18.818 --> 15:20.418
(files rustle)

15:20.487 --> 15:22.019
I'll see myself out.

15:23.490 --> 15:25.289
Thank you.

15:26.893 --> 15:28.693
<i> (footsteps recede,</i>
<i> door squeaks open)</i>

15:28.762 --> 15:30.828
(door thumps shut)
- you okay, dad?

15:30.964 --> 15:32.630
- I'm sorry I yelled.

15:32.699 --> 15:34.264
- No, no, it's okay.

15:35.335 --> 15:37.168
You did everything right.

15:37.237 --> 15:40.904
(phone buzzes and chimes)
it's just uh...

15:40.941 --> 15:43.640
Ugh! Sorry.
Just give me a second.

15:43.677 --> 15:45.843
- I did everything right.

15:45.978 --> 15:47.912
- What?

15:47.914 --> 15:49.514
<i> (car rumbles and honks nearby)</i>

15:49.649 --> 15:51.416
- Okay... This a bad time?

15:51.551 --> 15:53.384
<i> - No, it's fine. What is it?</i>

15:53.386 --> 15:55.520
- Well, figured whoever wrote
"die nora die"

15:55.655 --> 15:57.321
Must be connected
to our haunted house,

15:57.324 --> 15:59.123
So I did some digging.
- Okay, let me guess,

15:59.125 --> 16:01.925
What, it's... Built on a
cemetery by a cult of satanists?

16:01.962 --> 16:04.195
- (laughs) that would be
awesomely cool.

16:04.197 --> 16:06.263
- Nothing that juicy,
I'm afraid.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.399
Place was built by a guy
named paul sullivan.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.868
Bequeathed to his daughter,
astrid, after he died.

16:10.870 --> 16:13.171
<i> - Boomers, am I right?</i>

16:13.173 --> 16:14.271
I'll never own a home;
I'll just...

16:14.341 --> 16:16.607
Die in my one-bedroom apartment.

16:16.609 --> 16:18.675
- Astrid lived there her whole
life, raised a family,

16:18.712 --> 16:20.411
But couldn't make the payments.

16:20.413 --> 16:22.013
<i> Bank foreclosed after</i>
<i> she passed.</i>

16:22.148 --> 16:23.914
<i>There's been four owners since.</i>

16:23.984 --> 16:26.084
Guess who sold the house
to derek.

16:26.086 --> 16:28.852
- Die nora die.
- She's still alive?

16:30.957 --> 16:33.657
- That's right, liam.
Breathe with her.

16:33.727 --> 16:35.026
(horse exhales sharply)

16:35.095 --> 16:37.127
<i> No. Slow and steady.</i>

16:38.164 --> 16:39.897
<i> Just let it happen.</i>

16:39.966 --> 16:41.032
- (whispers) let it happen.

16:42.102 --> 16:44.235
- Good.
- Let it happen.

16:44.370 --> 16:46.004
- Good.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.507
(horse snorts abruptly)

16:52.846 --> 16:54.445
Look, I can't.

16:54.580 --> 16:56.180
Enough. I don't know why
I'm doing this.

16:56.182 --> 16:58.849
I mean, I mean I don't know why
this is so hard, but...

16:58.885 --> 17:00.350
(hands clap on legs)

17:02.388 --> 17:05.656
- Does anyone have anything
to offer to liam?

17:06.860 --> 17:08.893
- Maybe don't worry so much.

17:08.895 --> 17:11.863
- Okay, cool.
That's not really a tip.

17:11.865 --> 17:14.965
- Liam, what did you expect
to happen today?

17:15.035 --> 17:17.468
- (sighs)

17:17.470 --> 17:19.403
Well, you said a horse is
a mirror.

17:19.406 --> 17:22.139
She sees me. So, if I'm okay,
she's okay, right?

17:22.275 --> 17:24.242
- Yes.
- Well, I'm fine.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.044
- Fine isn't a feeling.
- Yeah, I know.

17:26.179 --> 17:28.745
Angry is a feeling.
Frustrated is a feeling.

17:30.817 --> 17:32.483
But I've been through a lot,
right, and, and...

17:32.552 --> 17:35.086
Here, I'm calm.

17:35.155 --> 17:38.423
No triggers, no danger,

17:38.558 --> 17:40.558
Except a horse kicking you
in the head.

17:40.560 --> 17:44.062
- Liam, you don't need to be
funny. Just be yourself.

17:44.197 --> 17:47.030
- Well, I feel more like myself
than I have in a long time,

17:47.067 --> 17:49.500
But still,
I can't connect with her.

17:49.635 --> 17:51.268
- And how do you feel now?

17:54.507 --> 17:56.841
- I'm supposed to leave here
in two weeks.

17:59.779 --> 18:02.913
I'm... I'm just worried that
I'm not ready yet.

18:06.186 --> 18:08.186
(sucks teeth) yeah.

18:09.989 --> 18:11.989
(dirt crunches)

18:13.659 --> 18:16.861
Neil: Jenny, let's start
with you today. Ready?

18:16.930 --> 18:18.663
- Yeah, sure.
(clears throat)

18:20.333 --> 18:22.933
- Be here.

18:22.969 --> 18:25.536
Hit the pillows with
what's on your mind.

18:25.671 --> 18:27.872
- Okay.

18:27.874 --> 18:29.273
(tense sigh)

18:29.342 --> 18:32.075
Be here now.

18:32.112 --> 18:34.478
Be here now.
All right, I...

18:34.547 --> 18:36.013
(sniffs)

18:36.149 --> 18:38.583
I'm thinking that--
- uh, uh. Feel.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.484
What're you feeling, jenny?

18:43.289 --> 18:44.956
- What am I feeling?
What am I feeling?

18:44.958 --> 18:46.990
What am I feeling? (sighs)

18:48.461 --> 18:50.561
(blows out her breath)

18:50.630 --> 18:52.296
I'm feeling angry.
(hard thud)

18:52.298 --> 18:55.166
- Good! Angry's hard for you.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.501
- I'm feeling angry that
my past is back. (hard thud)

18:57.570 --> 18:59.170
- Go there.

18:59.239 --> 19:02.039
- That, no matter what I do,
(hard thuds)

19:02.041 --> 19:03.507
It just keeps coming back.

19:03.576 --> 19:05.075
(dog barks)

19:05.145 --> 19:07.444
I forgave myself.
I moved on!

19:07.480 --> 19:11.114
It just keeps coming back!
(repeated thuds)

19:11.151 --> 19:14.018
It's not fair! It's not fair!
It's not fair!

19:14.153 --> 19:16.520
I just wanted my legos back!

19:16.589 --> 19:18.256
(jenny gasps,
bat clatters on the floor)

19:18.258 --> 19:20.491
(breathing heavily, she sobs)

19:22.896 --> 19:25.730
- Jenny.
- (sobs)

19:25.865 --> 19:27.632
- What's your truth right now?

19:27.767 --> 19:30.268
- Oh god, my whole body's
just buzzing.

19:30.270 --> 19:33.037
(sobs)
- let it out. Own your truth.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.739
What's the worst
that could happen?

19:34.874 --> 19:37.041
- (sobs) someone could die.

19:37.043 --> 19:39.076
<i>- I know your anger scares you,</i>
<i> jenny,</i>

19:39.078 --> 19:41.011
But you can use it to heal.

19:41.047 --> 19:43.614
- Yeah, and how?
How do I do that?

19:43.749 --> 19:45.750
- The place where you stop

19:45.752 --> 19:47.952
Is where you need
to push through.

19:47.954 --> 19:50.153
- (shaky breaths)

19:53.059 --> 19:55.193
(door beeps and clicks open)

19:59.866 --> 20:01.498
- Thank you.

20:01.500 --> 20:03.834

Uh, cliff malvern, I'm alison
from "slaughter into wine."

20:43.676 --> 20:46.477
- Yeah, the podcast.

20:46.479 --> 20:48.512
You said in your email.

20:48.548 --> 20:51.548
<i> Look, is talking to you gonna</i>
<i> help my case, or what?</i>

20:51.584 --> 20:54.217
- You were convicted on
all four counts of murder.

20:54.254 --> 20:56.653
<i> You confessed to all four.</i>

20:59.492 --> 21:02.859
I want to hear your story,
mr. Malvern. I...

21:03.930 --> 21:06.897
The listeners are interested
in...

21:06.899 --> 21:08.598
Your side of things.

21:10.903 --> 21:13.236
- So, which one you wanna hear
about?

21:13.273 --> 21:14.705
Marcy? Rachel?

21:14.707 --> 21:17.041
Deborah? Vicky?

21:22.148 --> 21:24.048

21:36.663 --> 21:39.196
Ter,
door clunks shut)

21:39.232 --> 21:41.065
- Look, that woman is not okay.

21:41.134 --> 21:42.666
She's about to jump right out
of her skin.

21:42.702 --> 21:44.668
- Yeah, well, she was okay
before she moved

21:44.704 --> 21:46.203
Into the haunted house.

21:46.272 --> 21:48.205
- I've lived in some sketchy
places in my time.

21:48.241 --> 21:49.874
You can't blame all that
on a house.

21:50.009 --> 21:51.408
(phone rings in the distance)

21:52.612 --> 21:54.278
<i> I mean, what could be so</i>
<i> terrifying on a video,</i>

21:54.280 --> 21:56.113
<i> That she can't ever</i>
<i> watch it again?</i>

(floorboards groan)

22:19.772 --> 22:21.505
(heavy exhale)

22:23.309 --> 22:24.909
- Okay, look,
I mean the fact that,

22:25.044 --> 22:26.310
That she just woke up
one morning

22:26.445 --> 22:28.712
And this video was on her
phone, if that happened to me,

22:28.715 --> 22:30.114
I would never go back
into that house again.

22:30.249 --> 22:31.649
- But someone wrote
that threat.

22:31.784 --> 22:34.485
- Someone, or some thing.

22:34.620 --> 22:36.386
Look, I still don't have
an explanation

22:36.422 --> 22:38.655
For the carbon monoxide, so--
- well, that's your department.

22:38.725 --> 22:41.258
All I know is I can't charge
a house for murder.

22:41.327 --> 22:43.160
They don't even make handcuffs
that size.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.667
- Okay. (sighs)

22:51.003 --> 22:52.603
What about contact tracing?

22:52.605 --> 22:54.404
- Tracking the movement
of infected people?

22:54.440 --> 22:55.940
<i> - Mm-hmm.</i>

22:56.075 --> 22:57.875
What if we could do that
for a house?

23:01.214 --> 23:02.879
(handcuffs rattle)

23:04.250 --> 23:05.749
- Marcy, she was a...

23:07.486 --> 23:10.287
A good-looking woman.
- I asked about michelle.

23:10.323 --> 23:12.055
- Told ya,
I never heard of her.

23:12.125 --> 23:15.926
- March 15, 1995,
you were in hamilton.

23:15.928 --> 23:18.262
- If you say so.

23:18.331 --> 23:20.497
- At your trial, the crown
connected the murders

23:20.533 --> 23:23.100
To your delivery routes -
calgary, toronto,

23:23.102 --> 23:25.769
Regina, thunder bay, kamloops.

23:25.772 --> 23:27.705
- You know...

23:27.840 --> 23:30.640
You don't seem like the type
for this sorta work.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.711
- All of your victims
lived near,

23:34.747 --> 23:36.947
Or worked at, truck stops.

23:36.949 --> 23:39.115
Michelle lived within walking
distance to a truck stop,

23:39.152 --> 23:42.319
<i> And there's a...</i>
<i> A gap in your timeline.</i>

23:42.355 --> 23:44.721
March '95, this didn't come out
in the trial.

23:44.791 --> 23:47.525
A friend of mine told me
that you were in hamilton

23:47.660 --> 23:49.559
<i> The night of the 15th.</i>

23:52.698 --> 23:54.231
(inhales slowly)

23:57.370 --> 23:59.537
Do you remember that night?

23:59.672 --> 24:01.338
(rain patters)

24:01.407 --> 24:03.207
It was raining.

24:03.342 --> 24:05.409
<i> (siren wails in the distance)</i>

24:08.547 --> 24:11.148
<i> (rain patters,</i>
<i> thunder rumbles)</i>

24:12.251 --> 24:13.917
(pencil rasp)

24:16.555 --> 24:18.455
(speaking anishinaabemowin)

24:19.758 --> 24:21.625
- I think my teacher will be
mad at me again.

24:21.760 --> 24:23.861
I'm making fun of
john a. Macdonald this time.

24:23.863 --> 24:26.297
- (chuckles softly)
alison, show respect.

24:27.967 --> 24:29.499
You know how they love
their old men.

24:29.535 --> 24:32.703
- Even the dead ones?
- Especially the dead ones.

24:35.708 --> 24:37.441
(pencil scratches)

24:37.576 --> 24:40.610
(rain pelts heavily,
thunder rumbles)

24:44.183 --> 24:46.516
- Ow!
- You've got knots again!

24:47.853 --> 24:50.454
You need to wash it tonight.
- But I have to finish this.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.590
(cereal dregs rattle
in the box)

24:53.626 --> 24:56.192
Mom, we're out of poppin' puffs.

24:56.229 --> 24:58.528
- I'll get some tomorrow
morning. It's raining.

24:58.530 --> 25:02.132
- Please? I need the
marshmallows for extra energy.

25:02.201 --> 25:06.103
- I'm reading that essay
before you hand it in.

25:06.105 --> 25:09.072
But I'll be back
in five minutes.

25:12.478 --> 25:15.412
(thunder rumbles,
rain pelts the window)

25:21.954 --> 25:25.422
- This is your chance to tell
your story, cliff.

25:25.491 --> 25:27.524
<i> - Come off it.</i>

25:27.593 --> 25:29.893
You're no podcaster.

25:33.832 --> 25:35.499
- This was a mistake.
(binder thumps shut)

25:35.634 --> 25:38.235
(items rustle)

25:38.370 --> 25:39.703
(raps on door,
door beeps open)

25:41.907 --> 25:43.841
I shouldn't have come.

25:45.611 --> 25:48.878
- You're very brave to face
that man.

25:48.915 --> 25:50.680
- What was I thinking?

25:51.850 --> 25:53.850
That he would just confess
to killing my mother

25:53.920 --> 25:55.986
Because he happened to be
in the same city

25:56.121 --> 25:58.254
The night she died? Just...

25:58.291 --> 25:59.523
- You had to try.

26:00.726 --> 26:03.060
(rain patters outside)

26:03.195 --> 26:05.261
- I just, I've...

26:05.298 --> 26:09.366
I've lived so long not knowing
what happened.

26:11.971 --> 26:14.338
And now I'm so close...

26:18.911 --> 26:22.278
I don't know if I wanna
find out.

26:24.750 --> 26:28.018
But I also don't wanna leave
before I...

26:28.054 --> 26:29.819
Know her story.

26:29.855 --> 26:31.755
(rain patters)

26:34.560 --> 26:35.959
(sighs)

26:41.300 --> 26:42.766
- I know a good story.

26:44.570 --> 26:46.903
It's about a beautiful

26:48.107 --> 26:49.939
And loving woman,

26:50.977 --> 26:53.076
An amazing mother,

26:54.914 --> 26:57.647
And a heartbreakingly
wonderful partner,

27:00.119 --> 27:02.586
Whose mother would've been
so proud of her.

27:05.591 --> 27:06.890
Her name's alison,

27:09.261 --> 27:11.328
And I love her.

27:14.367 --> 27:16.467
<i> (rain patters)</i>

27:20.773 --> 27:23.206
- I have to go back.

27:28.381 --> 27:30.814
I can't... Lie.

27:32.618 --> 27:33.817
(sniffles)

27:34.887 --> 27:37.287
I want him to know who I am.

27:41.260 --> 27:42.692
- We captured the randomized
cell phone data

27:42.728 --> 27:44.628
From derek's neighbourhood,
the night he died.

27:44.763 --> 27:46.964
This is every cell phone
in the neighbourhood.

27:47.099 --> 27:49.166
(phone rings in the distance)
- are those uh...?

27:49.168 --> 27:50.867
- The two phones that were
in derek's house

27:50.936 --> 27:52.569
The night he died.
- Yeah.

27:52.605 --> 27:54.038
- Yeah. One is derek's.

27:54.173 --> 27:55.739
- And the other?

27:55.741 --> 27:57.974
<i> - We don't know.</i>

27:58.010 --> 28:00.710
<i> It goes inside the house</i>
<i> and...</i>

28:00.746 --> 28:02.946
<i> Disappears. Every night.</i>

28:02.982 --> 28:04.981
Including last night.
- Yep, so whoever it is,

28:05.017 --> 28:07.985
They're still spending their
nights at casa del spooky.

- Right. (clears throat)

28:25.438 --> 28:26.937
(door slams shut,

28:27.072 --> 28:28.138
Do you think they'll show up?

28:28.273 --> 28:30.073
- Only one way to find out.

28:30.209 --> 28:31.841
(door clicks and squeaks open)

28:34.313 --> 28:36.279
I've hung out in worse places.

28:36.348 --> 28:38.549
- Worse than a house
that wants everyone dead?

28:39.919 --> 28:42.886

29:06.312 --> 29:07.911
- Why did you agree
to see me again?

29:07.913 --> 29:10.346
- Michelle...

29:10.382 --> 29:12.348
Was your mother.

29:14.586 --> 29:16.487
Don't you wanna sit?
- I'm fine.

29:16.622 --> 29:17.887
<i> - Okay.</i>

29:19.158 --> 29:21.124
Maybe...

29:21.160 --> 29:23.626
I was in hamilton in '95.

29:24.730 --> 29:27.264
- I just want the truth.
- So, tell me.

29:27.399 --> 29:29.399
- What?
- Tell me...

29:29.468 --> 29:30.867
<i> What happened to your mother,</i>

29:30.936 --> 29:33.536
And if I like what I hear,
I'll...

29:34.606 --> 29:36.873
(mouthing silently)
...Confess.

29:40.513 --> 29:42.746
- It was raining.

29:43.949 --> 29:46.516
She went to the truck stop.

29:48.487 --> 29:50.687
To their grocery store,
to buy some cereal, and...

29:53.091 --> 29:54.725
- And?

29:56.228 --> 29:57.761
- (inhales shakily)

29:58.964 --> 30:00.764
(exhales confidently)

30:03.068 --> 30:06.069
And you wanna know
what happened?

30:07.640 --> 30:09.239
(smirks)

30:10.309 --> 30:12.242
My mother watched me grow up.

30:14.780 --> 30:16.647
She saw me graduate.

30:18.884 --> 30:21.918
When I brought home
my first girlfriend,

30:21.987 --> 30:24.187
She was happy for me.

30:26.124 --> 30:29.059
She was beside me for
the birth of my child.

30:29.128 --> 30:32.663
She is with me here,
right now.

30:37.603 --> 30:39.102
And you...

30:41.140 --> 30:43.674
You're exactly where
you're supposed to be.

30:46.011 --> 30:47.844
- Wait.

30:49.248 --> 30:50.980
Thought you wanted my story.

30:52.585 --> 30:55.185
- You can keep your story
for yourself.

30:56.689 --> 30:58.321
I've got my own.

31:01.827 --> 31:04.695
(raps on door,
door beeps and clicks open)

31:09.501 --> 31:11.000
(door clunks shut)

31:11.036 --> 31:14.037
- I had a dream last night
that my house was haunting me.

31:14.039 --> 31:15.972
- (chuckles) I'd like to think
if I was dead,

31:16.041 --> 31:18.041
I'd have better things to do.

31:18.043 --> 31:20.844
- Yeah. I mean,
I don't believe in ghosts.

31:20.979 --> 31:22.745
That's a rabbit hole
I can't go down.

31:22.781 --> 31:25.214
- Yeah, I'm a detective.
I want an explanation.

31:26.585 --> 31:28.251
Is there something
on the other side to...

31:28.254 --> 31:30.186
Make sense of all this
craziness.

31:30.188 --> 31:32.222
- So, ghosts?

31:32.224 --> 31:34.258
- No, I--

31:34.393 --> 31:36.793
But in jamaica, we have
what they call "duppies."

31:36.829 --> 31:38.594
- Duppies.

31:38.631 --> 31:40.597
- Hmm. Duppies are malevolent
spirits

31:40.732 --> 31:42.198
Said to come out at night.

31:45.404 --> 31:47.603
- Okay, that sounds apropos.

31:47.640 --> 31:49.339
- I mean, story has it that

31:49.375 --> 31:52.575
Duppies are the manifestation
of the soul of the dead -

31:52.645 --> 31:55.312
Haunting and plaguing
the living.

31:55.447 --> 31:58.882
They suck all the joy
and happiness out-

31:59.017 --> 32:01.818
Outta the ones they haunt,
like a disease.

32:01.887 --> 32:04.620
(the house creaks and groans)

32:04.657 --> 32:06.290
- I mean, maybe that's
what's haunting this house?

32:06.425 --> 32:08.759
- Yeah, or worse.
It could be obeah,

32:08.894 --> 32:10.761
Or a voodoo curse.

32:10.896 --> 32:12.529
- Are you serious?

32:13.766 --> 32:15.299
- Yeah.

32:15.434 --> 32:17.500
Duppy season's not
'til November.

32:17.536 --> 32:20.403
- Oh, my god! You're such an...

32:20.439 --> 32:22.805

one's been hanging around.

35:24.923 --> 35:26.423
(clears throat)

35:27.726 --> 35:30.259
(motor rumbles loudly)

35:35.868 --> 35:37.300
(motor cuts out)

35:37.435 --> 35:39.368
- Wha...
- Ugh...

35:41.306 --> 35:43.239
Keep going.

35:43.308 --> 35:45.575
(coughing)

35:45.644 --> 35:47.978
<i> Keep going.</i>

35:48.113 --> 35:49.312
- (grunts)

35:52.918 --> 35:54.784
(cover scrapes and clangs)

35:59.925 --> 36:01.724
- The leaf blower guy?

36:05.497 --> 36:07.464
You built a bunker

36:07.599 --> 36:09.299
Just to keep people out
of a house.

36:09.434 --> 36:11.168
- My house.

36:12.404 --> 36:14.604
My grandfather built
this house.

36:14.739 --> 36:16.606
<i> And my mom was supposed</i>
<i> to leave it to me,</i>

36:16.741 --> 36:18.208
Until the bank took it away.

36:18.277 --> 36:20.142
<i> - Astrid sullivan was</i>
<i> your mother.</i>

36:20.179 --> 36:21.278
- So, you became the handyman.

36:21.413 --> 36:23.479
- I took care of the place,

36:23.515 --> 36:25.915
And I saved everything I had
to try and buy it back,

36:25.951 --> 36:29.252
But the price just kept going
up, and up, and up,

36:29.388 --> 36:31.887
And they make it impossible
for people like me!

36:31.924 --> 36:33.923
- Yeah, but that doesn't give
you the right to kill.

36:33.959 --> 36:35.258
- Derek...

36:36.562 --> 36:40.063
He was literally ripping
the guts outta my home!

36:40.065 --> 36:42.698
<i> This house was all I had.</i>

36:42.734 --> 36:44.634
<i> It was my house.</i>

36:45.871 --> 36:48.604
(phone rings nearby,
footsteps approach)

36:49.875 --> 36:51.374
(pen scratches)
- hey.

36:51.443 --> 36:54.844
- Hey. Uh, you got a minute?

36:56.481 --> 36:59.015
- Yeah.

36:59.150 --> 37:00.883
(footsteps recede)

37:03.055 --> 37:04.287
<i> You're resigning.</i>

37:08.227 --> 37:09.993
- Deep down,
I think I always knew

37:10.128 --> 37:11.827
What happened to my mother,

37:13.799 --> 37:16.065
And this job...

37:16.134 --> 37:19.602
Was about seeking justice
for people like her.

37:19.671 --> 37:21.671
<i> But it's all different now.</i>

37:21.806 --> 37:24.407
I feel like the living...

37:26.144 --> 37:27.643
Need my help more.

37:29.381 --> 37:31.815
- What're you gonna do now?

37:31.950 --> 37:34.150
- I'm going to work
for indigenous liberty.

37:36.121 --> 37:37.754
They need someone
with experience

37:37.756 --> 37:39.922
In restorative justice.

37:41.559 --> 37:43.326
- Yeah, no, that um...

37:44.496 --> 37:46.830
That makes, that makes total
sense. I think...

37:50.235 --> 37:51.801
I think you're doing
the right thing.

37:53.639 --> 37:55.204
- Thanks.

37:57.509 --> 38:00.242
- (sighs)

38:00.279 --> 38:02.178
What am I gonna do without you?

38:02.247 --> 38:03.346
- You'll manage.

38:04.449 --> 38:06.716
You have a team that
trusts you.

38:06.718 --> 38:09.052
(sniffles)

38:09.054 --> 38:11.587
You just need to start trusting
yourself more.

38:14.826 --> 38:17.260
You can do it, jenny cooper.

38:17.262 --> 38:18.928
- I can do it, jenny cooper.
- (chuckles)

38:18.964 --> 38:20.463
- (chuckles)

38:24.002 --> 38:25.634
Come here.

38:28.206 --> 38:30.540
Ugh...

38:30.675 --> 38:32.542
I love you, alison.

38:32.544 --> 38:34.344
I mean,
I hate that you're leaving.

38:34.413 --> 38:37.013
Both: (laughing)

38:37.015 --> 38:38.681
I love you.

38:38.684 --> 38:40.383
- I love you, too.

38:41.687 --> 38:43.686
But before I go...

38:44.756 --> 38:47.357
- (blows out her breath)

38:48.694 --> 38:50.760
(basket thumps lightly)
did you...?

38:50.895 --> 38:53.563
- Ta-da!

38:53.565 --> 38:56.366
- (chuckles)
- mixed berry.

38:56.501 --> 39:00.035
Your favourite.
- My favourite.

39:01.106 --> 39:02.372
(plates clatter)

39:03.575 --> 39:05.375
Oh, you're amazing, alison.

39:06.445 --> 39:09.311
- I know.
- (laughs)

39:10.382 --> 39:11.480
<i> Thank you.</i>

39:12.517 --> 39:15.084
(pie lifter rattles)

39:18.857 --> 39:20.990
If you ever need anything...

39:22.327 --> 39:24.326
If you ever wanna come back...

39:26.098 --> 39:27.864
- I know.

39:30.335 --> 39:33.269
(forks clink)

39:33.338 --> 39:34.871
(forks clank,
jenny sniffles)

39:34.940 --> 39:39.074
- I'm gonna get tears
in my pie. (laughs)

39:39.111 --> 39:41.210
- Mmm.
- Ugh...

39:43.482 --> 39:45.482
Oh, my god, it's so good.

39:45.617 --> 39:47.617
- I know!

39:47.619 --> 39:49.619
Both: (sniffling)

39:51.589 --> 39:53.989

39:55.494 --> 39:57.827

39:57.829 --> 40:00.696

- Hey.

40:00.766 --> 40:02.632
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah.

40:02.701 --> 40:04.867
You called, I'm here.

40:06.938 --> 40:08.638
Your move.

40:08.640 --> 40:11.106
- Right. Yeah.

40:11.143 --> 40:13.176
I um...

40:15.414 --> 40:17.313
I wanted to set
the record straight

40:17.382 --> 40:19.182
On what happened to my sister.

40:21.186 --> 40:23.118
- Great.

40:32.597 --> 40:35.598

40:46.478 --> 40:49.345
(traffic rumbles, kid shouts)

40:55.153 --> 40:56.819
The truth is that...

Um...

41:01.026 --> 41:03.292

no, jenny. No. No, jenny.

41:29.054 --> 41:30.586
- Bite.

41:30.588 --> 41:31.754
- (gasping breaths)

41:31.890 --> 41:34.557
- Jenny, here. Bite. Bite.
Bite the apple.

41:35.861 --> 41:38.460

41:38.497 --> 41:40.697
Scientific fact:
You can't have a panic attack

And eat an apple
at the same time.

41:45.870 --> 41:48.237
(breathing slows)

41:48.273 --> 41:50.239
- Okay. Okay.

41:52.611 --> 41:54.644
Jenny, when I lay murder
charges,

41:54.713 --> 41:56.879
There's only two things
that matter.

41:56.882 --> 41:59.282
Okay, will I get a conviction,

41:59.284 --> 42:01.851
And does it serve
the public interest?

42:04.088 --> 42:05.555
Did he kill your sister?

42:10.195 --> 42:11.894
- No.

42:19.905 --> 42:22.071
- Okay.

42:25.410 --> 42:27.376
