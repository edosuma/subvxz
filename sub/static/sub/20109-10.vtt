WEBVTT

00:02.575 --> 00:05.078
Come on, football!
Go, go!

00:07.246 --> 00:08.514
Oh, come on.

00:08.547 --> 00:10.683
Play football!

00:18.057 --> 00:19.592
Aaah!

00:20.793 --> 00:22.661
So, you're mining stuff
to craft with

00:22.695 --> 00:24.197
and crafting stuff to mine with?

00:24.230 --> 00:25.030
Uh-huh.

00:25.064 --> 00:26.099
Did your dad write this game?

00:26.132 --> 00:27.132
Mean.

00:30.269 --> 00:33.539
Gentlemen, you're needed
by a friend in Washington!

00:33.572 --> 00:36.109
How clandestine.

00:37.276 --> 00:38.944
If they can teleport,
why did we take...

00:38.977 --> 00:40.679
I just work here, Steve,
same as you!

00:41.914 --> 00:44.717
All right.
All right, all right.

00:44.750 --> 00:46.885
Mr. President.
It's about time, gentlemen.

00:46.919 --> 00:48.754
Rick, do you need
to drink in here?
Yes.

00:48.787 --> 00:50.022
Here's the adventure.

00:50.055 --> 00:51.624
Some kind of alien... googa

00:51.657 --> 00:53.359
has infested
the Kennedy Sex Tunnels.

00:53.392 --> 00:55.561
I want it hunted down
and taken out.

00:55.594 --> 00:56.895
Kennedy Sex Tunnels?

00:56.929 --> 00:58.431
Naturally, you'll forget
you saw them,

00:58.464 --> 01:00.433
along with, in order of
national embarrassment,

01:00.466 --> 01:02.768
the Truman Cocaine Lounge,
the McKinley Hooker Dump,

01:02.801 --> 01:04.803
and the Lincoln Slave Coliseum.

01:04.837 --> 01:06.105
He didn't free them all.

01:06.139 --> 01:07.473
And let me know
when you're done.

01:07.506 --> 01:08.874
Maybe then we could
get a selfie?

01:08.907 --> 01:11.043
Too busy, Morty.
Now tell me about this summit.

01:11.076 --> 01:13.746
Is it a peace one
or a regular one?

01:22.621 --> 01:25.424
Ugh. This sucks.

01:25.458 --> 01:26.592
God, tell me about it.

01:26.625 --> 01:28.060
Oh, man.
If you're not into it...

01:28.093 --> 01:29.795
What do you mean?
Why would I be into it?

01:29.828 --> 01:31.964
It's lame.
You're into lame stuff, Morty.

01:31.997 --> 01:34.099
I thought young dumb people
considered it an honor

01:34.133 --> 01:36.101
to work for presidents
or whatever the shit.

01:36.135 --> 01:38.604
Maybe the first few times,
but this just sucks.

01:38.637 --> 01:40.406
He treats us like Ghostbusters.

01:40.439 --> 01:42.275
We should talk to him.
Yeah, that sounds fun.

01:42.308 --> 01:44.777
Let's set some boundaries
with a spoiled control freak

01:44.810 --> 01:46.245
that thinks he runs the world

01:46.279 --> 01:48.113
and orders drone strikes
to cope with his insecurity.

01:48.147 --> 01:50.649
It's either that
or more of this.

01:50.683 --> 01:51.850
Third choice...

01:51.884 --> 01:53.586
"Minecraft."
You like it now?

01:53.619 --> 01:54.520
Got to be honest, Morty.

01:54.553 --> 01:55.553
It's growing on me.

01:55.554 --> 01:57.456
Notify the president.

01:57.490 --> 01:58.490
What do I tell him?

01:58.491 --> 01:59.858
Tell him the truth.

01:59.892 --> 02:03.762
Tell him Rick and Morty
just blew off America.

02:03.796 --> 02:06.999
**

02:35.428 --> 02:36.995
You can use that wood
to make a chest.

02:37.029 --> 02:38.589
Oh, good. Then I can
store all this wood

02:38.597 --> 02:40.065
I'll need later
for chest-making.

02:40.098 --> 02:41.667
Okay. You're not
going to have fun

02:41.700 --> 02:42.740
if you analyze everything.

02:42.768 --> 02:43.869
This is what they'd rather do?

02:43.902 --> 02:45.838
It's all in the transcript.

02:45.871 --> 02:47.573
"Treats us like Ghostbusters."

02:47.606 --> 02:49.242
So, Ghostbusters
aren't cool now?

02:49.275 --> 02:51.176
I don't recall
signing that bill.

02:51.210 --> 02:52.211
"Control freak."

02:52.245 --> 02:56.249
"Orders drone strikes
to cope with..."

02:56.282 --> 02:57.049
"Insecurity."

02:57.082 --> 02:58.384
Should we drone-strike
them?

02:58.417 --> 03:00.586
That would prove them right!
And blow him up.

03:00.619 --> 03:01.920
Give me the phone.

03:01.954 --> 03:03.389
Rick: Is this game popular
with autistic people?

03:03.422 --> 03:04.923
Why would you say
something like that?

03:04.957 --> 03:06.559
'Cause I'm starting to love it.

03:07.926 --> 03:09.528
"Failure to answer
is a felony offense"?

03:09.562 --> 03:11.922
Play it cool.
As far as he knows,
we're still in the tunnels.

03:13.466 --> 03:15.100
When should we reveal
we can see them?

03:15.133 --> 03:16.835
We're holding all
the cards right now.

03:16.869 --> 03:18.937
We don't show any before
the time is right.

03:18.971 --> 03:20.105
Awesome.
Rick: Yello?

03:20.138 --> 03:21.574
Hi, guys.
U.S. President calling.

03:21.607 --> 03:23.376
How's it going?
Oh, hey.

03:23.409 --> 03:25.089
Just hard at work
on this sex tunnel gagoo.

03:25.110 --> 03:27.280
I think it's kind of our
new archnemesis, you know?

03:27.313 --> 03:28.381
It might take a while.

03:28.414 --> 03:29.715
What do you think,
Morty... a month?

03:29.748 --> 03:31.250
Fingers crossed, a month, yeah.

03:32.618 --> 03:33.852
You lying dicks!

03:33.886 --> 03:35.454
I see your asses playing
"Minecraft"!

03:35.488 --> 03:36.855
I got you on satellite!

03:36.889 --> 03:38.190
That's right.

03:38.223 --> 03:39.625
What do you have to say
for yourselves?

03:39.658 --> 03:41.527
Okay, obviously, this looks
bad, Mr. President.

03:41.560 --> 03:42.761
I mean, what doesn't look bad

03:42.795 --> 03:44.075
through an illegal
spy satellite?

03:44.096 --> 03:45.431
Don't high-road me.

03:45.464 --> 03:46.932
The two of you break
1,000 federal laws a day.

03:46.965 --> 03:48.567
Wow, really?
That's pretty cool.

03:48.601 --> 03:50.969
And, yes, yes, yes, yes,
you save the world now and then.

03:51.003 --> 03:52.471
America returns that favor

03:52.505 --> 03:54.807
by not holding the two of you
accountable to its laws.

03:54.840 --> 03:56.309
Oh!
Oh! Oh, God.

03:56.342 --> 03:58.444
We... We didn't know
you saw it that way.

03:58.477 --> 04:00.078
Well, it's nobody's fault.

04:00.112 --> 04:01.947
We never had "the talk,"
so to speak.

04:01.980 --> 04:03.782
Yeah. I mean,
the way we see it,

04:03.816 --> 04:05.951
when we show up,
that's the favor to you.

04:05.984 --> 04:07.753
Especially, you know,
when it turns out

04:07.786 --> 04:09.788
you wanted someone to come over
just because you found

04:09.822 --> 04:11.424
an "X-Files" monster
in your basement.

04:11.457 --> 04:14.893
As for the reason you've never,
like, arrested us,

04:14.927 --> 04:17.062
we assumed you just knew
that it was impossible,

04:17.095 --> 04:18.630
like, if you tried.

04:18.664 --> 04:21.466
You know, it wouldn't go well.

04:21.500 --> 04:24.770
Wouldn't go well?
Can you elaborate?

04:24.803 --> 04:27.840
I think one of your 1,000 laws
says, no, I can't elaborate.

04:27.873 --> 04:29.742
Just trust me.
None of us want to go there.

04:29.775 --> 04:31.143
Which we'll never have to.

04:31.176 --> 04:33.078
By the way, we'll keep on
saving the Earth.

04:33.111 --> 04:34.480
You know, we're...
We're happy to do that.

04:34.513 --> 04:36.281
Yeah, but not because
it contains America...

04:36.315 --> 04:38.651
Because moving to a new version
of Earth is a bitch and a half.

04:38.684 --> 04:41.454
But feel free to call us, you
know, as... as, like, friends.

04:41.487 --> 04:44.490
Yeah, like, if you ever
want to take a selfie...

04:44.523 --> 04:47.159
So, are we cool?

04:47.192 --> 04:48.961
Yes.
Thank you, gentlemen.

04:48.994 --> 04:50.262
I told you, man!

04:50.295 --> 04:52.865
I'm impressed, Morty.
That went really well.

04:55.133 --> 04:57.135
Everybody, get ahold
of yourselves!

04:57.169 --> 04:59.338
Sir, what is our new
Rick and Morty policy?

04:59.372 --> 05:02.808
Our policy is, we never needed
them and never will again.

05:02.841 --> 05:04.977
Today, we celebrate
our independence

05:05.010 --> 05:07.513
from Rick and Morty.

05:07.546 --> 05:10.182
Everyone out.

05:18.056 --> 05:20.058
All this spring
at Clothes Mart,
there's a clothes sale.

05:20.092 --> 05:22.027
Come on down
to the clothes section.

05:22.060 --> 05:24.229
I just put it on for fun.
I know I can't buy it.

05:24.262 --> 05:27.232
Oh, come on. You look great!
You're only young once.

05:27.265 --> 05:29.167
Just promise, if the results
are too strong,

05:29.201 --> 05:30.369
you'll use protection.

05:30.403 --> 05:32.004
Really?! Thanks!

05:32.037 --> 05:34.507
When did you get rad?
I don't know.

05:34.540 --> 05:38.377
Maybe I adjusted to the divorce
and everything's new.

05:38.411 --> 05:40.012
I'll say. I couldn't stand you

05:40.045 --> 05:42.047
for more than an hour
at a time before.

05:42.080 --> 05:43.649
No... No offense.

05:43.682 --> 05:46.519
I like it. It's great.
You're like a different person.

05:46.552 --> 05:48.186
Yeah.

05:48.220 --> 05:50.723
Different person.

05:56.529 --> 05:58.263
Oh, not you.

05:58.296 --> 06:01.434
Vamos! Vamos!
Aaah!

06:01.467 --> 06:02.901
How do you like that, Morty?

06:02.935 --> 06:05.037
Whoa!
Just like "Minecraft"!

06:05.070 --> 06:07.205
Ooh, a tiny
nuclear-capable species

06:07.239 --> 06:08.741
just got discovered
in the Amazon.

06:08.774 --> 06:10.443
Let's go make first contact
before someone else

06:10.476 --> 06:11.109
gets all their shit.

06:11.143 --> 06:12.411
What about this?

06:12.445 --> 06:13.779
South Park did it
4 years ago, Morty.

06:13.812 --> 06:14.713
They're fast.

06:14.747 --> 06:16.114
Or we're slow.

06:19.752 --> 06:21.119
Don't do it, guys.

06:21.153 --> 06:23.756
The casualties would be
in the "Brazilians"

06:23.789 --> 06:25.257
because you're Brazilian.

06:25.290 --> 06:26.725
It's a threat and a pun.

06:26.759 --> 06:27.759
Nobody gets me.

06:27.760 --> 06:29.361
Americanos! Pressa!

06:48.180 --> 06:50.415
Oh. Hello, Rick.
You're here, too.

06:50.449 --> 06:52.551
I guess this is a global crisis.

06:52.585 --> 06:53.752
Oh, God.

06:53.786 --> 06:55.654
Mr. President, Morty and I
have the situation covered.

06:55.688 --> 06:57.055
I'm sure you did.

06:57.089 --> 06:58.591
Dismissed.
Dismissed?

06:58.624 --> 06:59.925
Yeah, dismissed.

06:59.958 --> 07:02.394
Not needed here. You can leave
and nobody will care.

07:02.427 --> 07:04.763
Have you never heard
that before?
Do you even know how to take out
this kind of threat?

07:04.797 --> 07:06.431
We're not taking it out.

07:06.465 --> 07:09.301
We're going to shrink down and
approach them diplomatically.

07:12.538 --> 07:15.508
You shrink with pills?
Are you still here?

07:15.541 --> 07:17.109
Shouldn't you be going down
to your next version of Earth

07:17.142 --> 07:19.111
with your selfie-craving
star-fucker sidekick?

07:19.144 --> 07:20.646
Whoa!
We're allowed to be here.

07:20.679 --> 07:22.280
You aren't president
of the Amazon.

07:22.314 --> 07:24.116
Yeah, I learned about
your job in school.

07:24.149 --> 07:25.651
You're a civil servant.

07:25.684 --> 07:26.819
We're technically your boss.

07:26.852 --> 07:28.153
Oh, please, Morty.

07:28.186 --> 07:29.622
You pay as many taxes
as you have pubes.

07:29.655 --> 07:32.290
Oh, I got pubes,
Commander-in-Queef.

07:32.324 --> 07:34.627
You want to count them?
Commander-in-Queef.

07:34.660 --> 07:36.695
That's it! Do it!

07:36.729 --> 07:38.831
Recognize the rare element
Sanchez-eum?

07:38.864 --> 07:41.500
We've been preparing
for a Rick-level eventuality
for some time.

07:41.534 --> 07:43.669
You mean you've been ordering
other people to prepare for it

07:43.702 --> 07:45.771
while you sat on your ass
at peace summits.

07:45.804 --> 07:46.839
Peace summits are important!

07:46.872 --> 07:47.973
Oh, yeah!
They work great!

07:48.006 --> 07:49.642
We're really drowning in peace!

07:49.675 --> 07:51.309
You suck!
You suck!

07:51.343 --> 07:52.778
Task Force Alpha,
prepare to shrink.

07:52.811 --> 07:55.814
Is there a Task Force Alpha
health plan, by the way?

07:55.848 --> 07:58.316
Because if those pills are based
on subatomic compression,

07:58.350 --> 07:59.710
you could get a more
curable cancer

07:59.718 --> 08:02.020
just walking through
the mushroom clouds.

08:02.054 --> 08:04.790
God damn it!
I'll do it.

08:04.823 --> 08:05.824
Whoa.

08:05.858 --> 08:07.125
Task Force Alpha is disbanded.

08:07.159 --> 08:09.127
And you two aren't
American anymore!

08:09.161 --> 08:10.796
I can say that.
You're expatriated!

08:10.829 --> 08:12.998
If you step foot
on homeland soil again,

08:13.031 --> 08:14.900
I'll treat it as an invasion.

08:14.933 --> 08:15.901
Is this supposed to be painful?

08:15.934 --> 08:17.069
Painful to watch.

08:17.102 --> 08:18.571
Oh, such lame shrinking.

08:18.604 --> 08:21.073
Oh, his clothes
stay the same size?

08:21.106 --> 08:23.542
'70s shrinking, party of one.

08:23.576 --> 08:26.679
Eat my shrinking ass!

08:26.712 --> 08:29.514
There he goes. All right.
Let's get out of here, Morty.

08:30.783 --> 08:31.984
What the hell?!

08:32.017 --> 08:34.219
I made Sanchez-eum up,
dumbasses.

08:34.251 --> 08:36.188
Don't believe everything
you read on Wikipedia.

08:36.221 --> 08:37.221
Stand down.

08:37.222 --> 08:39.091
He's not afraid of pirates.

08:39.124 --> 08:43.095
Oh! Run, Morty!
That part was true!

08:57.576 --> 09:00.112
I-I can't talk now, sweetie.
Oh, when can you?

09:00.145 --> 09:01.680
- Good point.
- What's up?

09:01.714 --> 09:03.682
Remember a little while ago
when you said that, if I wanted,

09:03.716 --> 09:06.451
I could, like, leave Earth
and wander the infinite cosmos

09:06.484 --> 09:08.854
to figure out who I am and that
nobody would ever know I'd left

09:08.887 --> 09:11.389
because you could
replace me with a clone?

09:11.423 --> 09:12.791
Mm-hmm.
Am I the clone?

09:12.825 --> 09:14.627
Sorry. What?
Am I the clone?

09:14.660 --> 09:16.261
Did the real me choose to leave,
and I only think I chose to stay

09:16.294 --> 09:17.429
because that's
what I need to think

09:17.462 --> 09:20.065
because I'm
the replacement Beth?

09:20.098 --> 09:21.800
No.
Okay.

09:21.834 --> 09:26.739
And one more thing.
If I were a clone,
would you tell me?

09:26.772 --> 09:28.641
Beth, you know, when...
When smart people get happy,

09:28.674 --> 09:30.575
they stop recognizing
themselves.

09:30.609 --> 09:34.246
And you are very smart because
you're very much my daughter.

09:34.279 --> 09:37.249
Oh, God. You're right.
I'm sorry.

09:37.282 --> 09:38.150
Thank you, Dad.

09:38.183 --> 09:39.251
All good?
Totally.

09:39.284 --> 09:41.253
I'm fine now.

09:41.286 --> 09:43.722
And just to be sure,
you're not pretending
to be convinced you're real

09:43.756 --> 09:45.557
because you're actually
convinced you're a clone

09:45.590 --> 09:47.425
and you're now terrified
that becoming self-aware

09:47.459 --> 09:49.327
would mean I'd have
to terminate you?

09:50.195 --> 09:52.564
No.
Okay. Glad I could help.

09:52.597 --> 09:53.766
See you soon.

09:55.634 --> 09:58.170
Aaaaaah!

10:05.878 --> 10:08.113
Where do I go?

10:08.146 --> 10:10.749
What does th... What... What...
What... What does this mean?

10:10.783 --> 10:11.516
This means nothing.

10:11.549 --> 10:13.418
Pull forward and park.

10:13.451 --> 10:15.654
Then say that, God damn it!

10:15.688 --> 10:16.822
Sorry.

10:16.855 --> 10:18.290
Bad day.

10:19.992 --> 10:22.627
I am Presidentress of
the Mega Gargantuans.

10:22.661 --> 10:25.297
We named ourselves
before learning we were small.

10:25.330 --> 10:28.000
Madam Presidentress,
I'm President of America,

10:28.033 --> 10:29.153
which is basically the world,

10:29.167 --> 10:30.468
but you didn't hear that
from me.

10:30.502 --> 10:32.204
I've come to...
I know who you are.

10:32.237 --> 10:33.872
We've already agreed
to a ceasefire

10:33.906 --> 10:35.640
with your ambassadors,
Rick and Morty.

10:35.674 --> 10:37.676
Rick and Morty were here?
Of course they were here.

10:37.710 --> 10:39.511
They can shrink
instantly and teleport.

10:39.544 --> 10:41.646
They told me to give you this.

10:41.680 --> 10:43.840
They said it will stretch
as your cancer pill wears off

10:43.849 --> 10:46.952
and your body awkwardly enlarges
at the rate of a '50s movie.

10:46.985 --> 10:48.153
Are there pants?

10:48.186 --> 10:49.988
They said you'd prefer
just a shirt.

10:50.022 --> 10:53.191
Apparently, you have a need
to swing your dick around?

10:54.059 --> 10:56.161
Rick and Morty escaped.

10:56.194 --> 10:57.863
No shit.
Take me to the Pentagon.

10:57.896 --> 10:59.497
We're at war
with Rick and Morty.

10:59.531 --> 11:01.166
You'll want to make a stop
at the White House?

11:01.199 --> 11:03.668
I have pants at the Pentagon,
Rhonda. It's in my contract.

11:03.702 --> 11:05.503
I mean you need to call
a press conference.

11:05.537 --> 11:08.206
Israel and Palestine have
announced a permanent ceasefire.

11:08.240 --> 11:09.842
What?
They signed something called

11:09.875 --> 11:12.344
"The Pretty Obvious If You
Think About It" accord.

11:12.377 --> 11:14.679
Apparently, an anonymous
American diplomat

11:14.713 --> 11:16.681
took them
to a "Star Wars" cantina,

11:16.715 --> 11:18.717
where they smoked
perspective-enhancing

11:18.751 --> 11:20.853
alien pheromones
through a laser hookah.

11:20.886 --> 11:22.354
I still say it has to be Putin.

11:22.387 --> 11:23.922
It was Rick and Morty,
you fucking dunce!

11:23.956 --> 11:25.357
But you're getting
the credit, sir.

11:25.390 --> 11:27.259
Your approval rating
just hit 100%.

11:27.292 --> 11:28.861
Why would Rick
and Morty want that?

11:28.894 --> 11:30.462
Because they're assholes!

11:31.529 --> 11:34.532
I'm flattered,
but it takes a whole team
to achieve what we did today.

11:34.566 --> 11:35.934
Thank you.

11:35.968 --> 11:37.669
Well?
They haven't been
back home, sir.

11:37.702 --> 11:40.438
We've got every possible
location under surveillance.

11:40.472 --> 11:42.107
God damn it!
They're right here!

11:42.140 --> 11:43.675
They're here, God damn it!
Code Red! We need backup!

11:43.708 --> 11:45.377
Everybody relax.

11:45.410 --> 11:46.745
Just waiting for you
in the only room

11:46.779 --> 11:48.280
you can't blow up or spy on.

11:48.313 --> 11:50.082
So, we're not changing
timelines for you,

11:50.115 --> 11:51.716
but now you have
everything you want,

11:51.750 --> 11:52.951
so you can forget we exist,

11:52.985 --> 11:54.119
and we'll return the favor.

11:54.152 --> 11:55.687
You couldn't say that in a text?

11:55.720 --> 11:58.090
Well, since we won't be seeing
each other again, my...

11:58.123 --> 12:00.192
Guys, we get it.
It's a Code Red. Enough.

12:00.225 --> 12:02.094
My grandson has
worked hard for you,

12:02.127 --> 12:03.929
and I feel like
he's earned a selfie.

12:03.962 --> 12:06.598
Honestly, I could take it
or leave it at this point.
You're taking it.

12:06.631 --> 12:08.867
No. What kind of fratty-ass
status move is that?

12:08.901 --> 12:10.068
Get out of my office!

12:10.102 --> 12:11.403
Seriously?
You're that stubborn?

12:11.436 --> 12:13.605
He's the stubborn one.
I'm protecting my country.

12:13.638 --> 12:14.873
Uh, from selfies?

12:14.907 --> 12:16.274
From subordination
to hostile powers.

12:16.308 --> 12:17.976
Uh, does China know about
that deal-breaker?

12:18.010 --> 12:19.490
China doesn't piss
on the White House.

12:19.511 --> 12:20.779
Well, why would they?
I'm sure it was expensive.

12:20.813 --> 12:22.948
Get out.
Not without a selfie.

12:22.981 --> 12:25.250
Arrest them.
Son, you have a right
to refuse his order,

12:25.283 --> 12:26.819
and I guarantee you're going
to die if you touch me,

12:26.852 --> 12:29.321
and there's no afterlife.
Everything just goes black.

12:29.354 --> 12:30.488
Don't do it.

12:30.522 --> 12:31.756
Whoa, Rick!
Okay.

12:31.790 --> 12:32.657
What was that?

12:32.690 --> 12:33.826
Death.
What kind?

12:33.859 --> 12:34.893
Instant.
There was no sound.

12:34.927 --> 12:36.161
He just died.
Yeah, terrifying.

12:36.194 --> 12:37.762
It's a terrifying thing
to watch happen.

12:37.796 --> 12:38.997
It's called a deterrent.

12:39.031 --> 12:40.165
You couldn't just knock him out?

12:40.198 --> 12:42.234
How is knocking out a deterrent?

12:42.267 --> 12:43.635
Everyone wants to be
knocked out.

12:43.668 --> 12:44.937
Nobody wants to be dead.

12:44.970 --> 12:46.304
You committed murder
in the Oval Office.

12:46.338 --> 12:47.639
Now you can't leave.
That's fine.

12:47.672 --> 12:49.007
I said I'm not leaving
without a selfie.

12:49.041 --> 12:50.342
Uh, I don't need a selfie.

12:50.375 --> 12:51.743
And I'm saying
you aren't getting one

12:51.776 --> 12:52.845
and you aren't leaving.

12:52.878 --> 12:55.080
So we agree?
Yes. No. We disagree

12:55.113 --> 12:57.015
because you think you're getting
a selfie and leaving.

12:57.049 --> 12:58.183
Am I getting a selfie?

12:58.216 --> 12:59.617
Never.
Then I'm never leaving.

12:59.651 --> 13:00.819
Exactly.
See?

13:00.853 --> 13:02.020
Does anyone have a shot?

13:02.054 --> 13:04.356
Yes, nine people.
I can show you.

13:04.389 --> 13:05.523
But I wouldn't recommend...

13:05.557 --> 13:07.025
Open fire!

13:07.059 --> 13:08.160
God, you are dumb!

13:08.193 --> 13:09.194
Get the President out of here!

13:09.227 --> 13:11.029
Bad idea.
Wait. Why?

13:11.063 --> 13:12.297
Because if there isn't
someone in here

13:12.330 --> 13:13.698
that they're not
supposed to kill,

13:13.731 --> 13:15.300
they're going to wreck
the place trying to kill me.

13:15.333 --> 13:17.335
As long as you live,
no matter where you are,

13:17.369 --> 13:19.371
if it isn't in
a selfie with him,

13:19.404 --> 13:21.106
I'll be here.

13:21.139 --> 13:22.774
Jesus!
He's not a fucking god!

13:22.807 --> 13:23.976
You don't know what I am!

13:24.009 --> 13:25.043
And you don't know
what I can do!

13:25.077 --> 13:26.344
Jesus!
It's... It's cool, Rick!

13:26.378 --> 13:27.712
I'm Doctor Who
in this mother fucker!

13:27.745 --> 13:29.481
I could be a clone.
I could be a hologram.

13:29.514 --> 13:31.283
We could be clones
controlled by robots

13:31.316 --> 13:32.617
controlled with special headsets

13:32.650 --> 13:34.052
that the real Rick and Morty
are wearing

13:34.086 --> 13:35.020
while they're fucking
your mother!

13:35.053 --> 13:36.054
I'm going to kill you!

13:36.088 --> 13:37.956
Then come to 312 Olive Street!

13:37.990 --> 13:39.224
Is that her address?

13:39.257 --> 13:40.893
You don't know because
you're a bad son!

13:40.926 --> 13:41.793
Ow!
Take him down!

13:41.826 --> 13:43.395
Semper fi!

13:43.428 --> 13:44.229
Aaaaah!

13:44.262 --> 13:46.131
Number three, The Twister.

13:46.164 --> 13:47.732
Ow! Damn it.
Number four...

13:47.765 --> 13:49.001
The Hanky Panky.

13:50.768 --> 13:52.237
Beth?

13:52.270 --> 13:54.239
My dad might have cloned me,
and I might be the clone.

13:54.272 --> 13:56.074
And he says I'm not, but that's
what he'd say to a clone.

13:56.108 --> 13:57.175
Typical.

13:57.209 --> 13:58.743
Number six, The Texas Ripple.

13:58.776 --> 14:00.012
You look like you to me.

14:00.045 --> 14:01.179
What are you, an idiot?

14:01.213 --> 14:02.981
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

14:03.015 --> 14:04.582
That was so rude.

14:04.616 --> 14:06.384
I came to you for help, and now
I'm insulting your intelligence.

14:06.418 --> 14:07.886
And look where
intelligence gets you.

14:07.920 --> 14:10.088
Well, don't knock intelligence,
because right now

14:10.122 --> 14:12.991
I'd love to understand
how I can help you.

14:13.025 --> 14:14.425
I can't be in charge
of that, Jerry.

14:14.426 --> 14:16.995
My mind, my ideas are all
part of the variable.

14:17.029 --> 14:19.097
The only constant is you.

14:19.131 --> 14:21.934
You know me inside and out.

14:21.967 --> 14:25.270
Do what you have to do.

14:25.303 --> 14:26.939
Okay. Sit down.

14:26.972 --> 14:28.373
Now cross your legs.

14:28.406 --> 14:29.841
That leg on top. Good.

14:29.874 --> 14:31.944
Oh, what is this?

14:33.145 --> 14:34.612
Senior year,
I took you on a date

14:34.646 --> 14:36.448
to the Milwaukee
Symphony Orchestra

14:36.481 --> 14:39.251
performing the music
of Alan Silvestri in the Park.

14:39.284 --> 14:41.619
At this point in the song
from "Volcano,"

14:41.653 --> 14:43.621
when Tommy Lee Jones
and the utility workers

14:43.655 --> 14:46.291
are using cars to guide
the lava into a cul-de-sac,

14:46.324 --> 14:48.060
I realized my palms
were so sweaty,

14:48.093 --> 14:49.493
I would never get
to hold your hand.

14:49.494 --> 14:50.795
But I was desperate
to touch you,

14:50.828 --> 14:53.031
so I wiped my palm
on the grass next to me.

14:53.065 --> 14:54.967
But a Snickers wrapper
kind of got stuck on it,

14:55.000 --> 14:56.701
so I started
kind of jiggling it,

14:56.734 --> 14:58.570
whipping it without
moving too much.

14:58.603 --> 15:00.205
But you started looking over,
and I thought,

15:00.238 --> 15:02.240
"Well, this is it. She's going
to see that I'm a loser,

15:02.274 --> 15:03.441
and I'll never get to touch her.

15:03.475 --> 15:05.043
But I still have time
to touch her."

15:05.077 --> 15:06.478
But my hand had Snickers on it,

15:06.511 --> 15:07.980
and the brass section
was swelling

15:08.013 --> 15:09.614
because it was the scene with
the guy melting in the lava.

15:09.647 --> 15:12.017
And I just thought, "Fuck it.
Lips don't sweat."

15:14.852 --> 15:16.454
Wow. Yeah.

15:16.488 --> 15:19.057
I'll never forget that feeling.

15:19.091 --> 15:20.925
You're the real thing.

15:20.959 --> 15:22.227
Then that settles it,

15:22.260 --> 15:24.829
because my memory
is of hating that night.

15:24.862 --> 15:28.000
But now, reliving it,
all I can feel is how lucky I am

15:28.033 --> 15:33.171
to be loved by such a simple,
honest, simple man.

15:33.205 --> 15:34.472
Simple twice.

15:34.506 --> 15:37.142
This isn't the woman
you married, Jerry,

15:37.175 --> 15:38.443
because this woman loves you.

15:38.476 --> 15:41.279
Uh... well,
vive la différence.

15:41.313 --> 15:44.316
Okay. That was lame.

15:44.349 --> 15:47.585
Listen, I... Words.

15:47.619 --> 15:48.853
Don Cheadle.

15:53.891 --> 15:56.261
You have the right to get
the fuck out of my office!

15:56.294 --> 15:57.962
You have the right
to kiss my dick!

15:57.996 --> 15:59.697
Give me the thing.

15:59.731 --> 16:01.699
Ugh!

16:01.733 --> 16:04.369
Oh!

16:09.541 --> 16:12.177
Ugh!

16:38.670 --> 16:41.606
Oh!

16:44.042 --> 16:46.278
Ugh! Ugh!

17:06.431 --> 17:08.031
Ohh!

17:08.066 --> 17:10.102
Submit!
Submit for the selfie!

17:10.135 --> 17:11.935
I yield! I yield!
Take the selfie!

17:11.969 --> 17:15.272
Okay. Morty, get in there
and say, "Cheese."

17:15.307 --> 17:16.907
Morty?

17:16.941 --> 17:18.076
Morty, come on!

17:18.109 --> 17:19.944
God damn it!

17:21.479 --> 17:25.117
Rick, don't get mad,
but I-I stole your portal gun.

17:25.150 --> 17:26.451
What the fuck, Morty?!

17:26.483 --> 17:29.287
I told you I didn't want
the damn selfie 800 times!

17:29.321 --> 17:30.755
Look, whatever the hell
is going on between you

17:30.788 --> 17:32.748
and the president,
it's got nothing to do with me.

17:32.757 --> 17:34.592
So where did you go?
I can't tell you.

17:34.626 --> 17:36.928
Rick, did you tell my mom
she might be a clone?

17:36.961 --> 17:38.563
No! I told her she wasn't!

17:38.596 --> 17:40.232
Well, isn't that
what you'd tell a clone?

17:40.265 --> 17:41.533
Oh, for Christ's sake.

17:41.566 --> 17:43.301
Rick, my mom and dad
are getting back together.

17:43.335 --> 17:44.969
What? No!
She's not a clone!

17:45.002 --> 17:47.105
Well, she says it doesn't
matter if she is or isn't

17:47.139 --> 17:48.406
because now she loves my dad,

17:48.440 --> 17:49.974
and she wanted me
and Summer to come home,

17:50.007 --> 17:52.310
and we're hiding from you
so you don't kill her

17:52.344 --> 17:53.778
if she's a clone in a place

17:53.811 --> 17:55.547
I picked that
you will never find.

17:55.580 --> 17:58.316
So don't look for us.

17:59.517 --> 18:00.418
Come on, bitch!

18:00.452 --> 18:01.786
Oh, you come on, bitch.

18:01.819 --> 18:03.321
I'm out. I'm done.

18:03.355 --> 18:05.490
I've got to...
I've got to go.

18:05.523 --> 18:07.759
So I win. Then I'm in charge,
and you can't leave.

18:07.792 --> 18:09.494
You're a terrorist.
You're an enemy of the state,

18:09.527 --> 18:11.229
and you kicked me in the balls
10 minutes ago!

18:11.263 --> 18:12.897
The office of the President
can't coexist

18:12.930 --> 18:15.099
with a living god
that won't submit to it...

18:15.133 --> 18:16.501
I mean, besides Poseidon.

18:16.534 --> 18:18.170
But he's locked up
in Area 51 already,

18:18.203 --> 18:19.471
so that doesn't really count.

18:19.504 --> 18:20.838
Mr. President,
I'll make you a deal.

18:20.872 --> 18:23.141
If you let me use
your ghetto-ass off-brand

18:23.175 --> 18:24.776
deficit-tripling teleporter,

18:24.809 --> 18:27.479
I can go take care of something,
and you'll never see me again.

18:27.512 --> 18:30.482
Yes. Deal.
Invisi-troopers, stand down.

18:30.515 --> 18:31.516
Yeah, yeah.

18:31.549 --> 18:33.017
I don't want to hear it.

18:33.050 --> 18:34.152
You know I could see them
this whole time, right?

18:34.186 --> 18:35.520
Don't push it, Sanchez.

18:46.164 --> 18:47.465
He found us!

18:47.499 --> 18:48.600
I told you
we shouldn't have gone

18:48.633 --> 18:50.001
to the same cabin as last time!

18:50.034 --> 18:53.538
Oh, we're not going anywhere.
This ends now.

18:53.571 --> 18:55.440
Dad, if you're my dad.

18:55.473 --> 18:56.841
Of course, you're not my dad.

18:56.874 --> 18:58.676
You're here with a gun
because I am a clone.

18:58.710 --> 19:00.212
I guess I have all
your daughter's memories.

19:00.245 --> 19:04.048
So I guess I was her,
which makes me related to her.

19:04.081 --> 19:05.717
But I don't relate to her.

19:05.750 --> 19:09.287
She left her family and me,
which means I relate to them.

19:09.321 --> 19:10.555
So if you kill me, fine.

19:10.588 --> 19:11.723
You're not killing her.

19:11.756 --> 19:13.225
But you're killing
a real family.

19:13.258 --> 19:15.827
And instead of doing that,
will you just go away?

19:15.860 --> 19:17.629
Aren't there, like,
infinite time lines?

19:17.662 --> 19:19.864
Can't you just move to one
where I don't know I'm a clone

19:19.897 --> 19:22.133
and where a different
but identical version

19:22.166 --> 19:24.736
of your authentic
sociopathic crazy bitch

19:24.769 --> 19:27.171
of a daughter can keep
making you proud

19:27.205 --> 19:29.407
by being somewhere else?

19:29.441 --> 19:31.909
Beth, you crazy bitch.
You're my daughter.

19:31.943 --> 19:33.678
I brought this here
to kill Jerry.

19:33.711 --> 19:35.747
Oh, my God!
Jesus Christ!

19:35.780 --> 19:38.750
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
You win, Jerry. You win!

19:38.783 --> 19:42.053
No amount of genius can stop
your dumb mediocre vacuous roots

19:42.086 --> 19:44.088
from digging into everything
and everyone around you

19:44.121 --> 19:46.858
and draining them of
any ability to fend you off.

19:46.891 --> 19:50.061
Well, it couldn't have been
easy for you to say that.

19:50.094 --> 19:51.195
I appreciate it.

19:51.229 --> 19:52.349
Morty, where's my portal gun?

19:52.364 --> 19:53.364
Let's get out of here.

19:53.365 --> 19:54.499
I'm staying here, Rick.

19:54.532 --> 19:56.334
Are you... Ugh!

19:56.368 --> 19:57.535
Nobody gets it.

19:57.569 --> 19:59.237
Nothing you think matters
matters.

19:59.271 --> 20:00.505
This isn't special.

20:00.538 --> 20:01.939
This... This is happening
infinite times

20:01.973 --> 20:03.275
across infinite realities.

20:03.308 --> 20:04.942
Including this?

20:04.976 --> 20:06.611
Yes!

20:06.644 --> 20:10.114
Which is not to say that,
subjectively, it wasn't funny.

20:10.147 --> 20:11.349
Are you going to stay?

20:11.383 --> 20:12.884
There's infinite
time lines, Morty.

20:12.917 --> 20:15.119
Why would I stay in the one
where I trashed the White House,

20:15.152 --> 20:16.621
became an enemy of America

20:16.654 --> 20:19.624
and the lowest-status character
in my idiot family?

20:21.493 --> 20:23.295
Because of the fart?

20:23.328 --> 20:24.929
There's still some rubble
over there.

20:24.962 --> 20:27.365
I don't think you've
ever understood

20:27.399 --> 20:29.734
what "Secretary of the Interior"
means!

20:29.767 --> 20:31.769
Hi, Mr. President.
I'm Rick Sanchez,

20:31.803 --> 20:33.371
but not the one that did this.

20:33.405 --> 20:36.541
We Ricks travel the infinite and
switch places with each other

20:36.574 --> 20:38.242
like hermit crabs, I think.

20:38.276 --> 20:39.977
I'm fly-fishing Rick.

20:40.011 --> 20:41.646
You can distinguish me
from the Rick that you had
a falling-out with

20:41.679 --> 20:45.049
by my fly-fishing enthusiasm
and accompanying hat.

20:45.082 --> 20:46.217
I hope I can be of service

20:46.250 --> 20:48.252
if, uh, you ever find
the planet to be in danger.

20:48.286 --> 20:51.423
Friends?

20:51.456 --> 20:53.257
Sounds good to me.

20:53.291 --> 20:54.659
Kids, dinner!

20:54.692 --> 20:56.093
I got Panda Express!

20:56.127 --> 20:57.329
Did you get sugar chicken?

20:57.362 --> 20:58.796
That's kind of the only
thing they have.

20:58.830 --> 21:00.765
I love Panda E!
Thanks, Mom!

21:00.798 --> 21:03.100
I'm hoping to get a piece
of your sugar chicken later.

21:03.134 --> 21:05.136
Stop it.

21:05.169 --> 21:07.071
Here's your stupid hat, dipshit.

21:07.104 --> 21:09.441
Dad, you can't talk to
Jerry that way anymore.

21:09.474 --> 21:11.108
We're a real family now.

21:11.142 --> 21:13.411
In many ways, things
will be like season 1

21:13.445 --> 21:14.746
but more streamlined.

21:14.779 --> 21:16.914
Now Jerry and I are happily
married parents,

21:16.948 --> 21:18.516
and the idea
that I was motivated

21:18.550 --> 21:20.518
by a fear of you leaving
can be eschewed.

21:20.552 --> 21:22.687
Eschewed?
You've never used that word.

21:22.720 --> 21:24.021
Maybe you are a clone.

21:24.055 --> 21:26.424
It's not like
Rick would tell us.

21:32.196 --> 21:35.400
**

22:02.994 --> 22:05.630
Ooh-wee!
What a season!

22:05.663 --> 22:08.366
Sorry I never showed up,
but I got married.

22:08.400 --> 22:09.734
I had a baby.

22:09.767 --> 22:12.704
I went back to school
and got my G-E-E-E-D.

22:12.737 --> 22:15.006
What did you do
while you were waiting?

22:15.039 --> 22:19.010
Hopefully you didn't
just fuck around
and waste your life.

22:19.043 --> 22:20.244
Ooh-wee!

22:20.277 --> 22:25.349
See you for Season 4 in,
like, a really long time!

22:25.383 --> 22:29.387
I might even have
a big white Santa Claus beard

22:29.421 --> 22:31.523
and... and... and a...

22:31.556 --> 22:33.925
And a couple of grandkids

22:33.958 --> 22:36.661
and all that kind of stuff.

22:36.694 --> 22:38.763
See you... See you then!
