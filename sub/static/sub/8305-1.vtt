00:32.667 --> 00:35.235
...after two days in
the California desert

00:35.236 --> 00:38.471
in temperatures above 110 degrees.

00:38.472 --> 00:42.042
President Kennedy is flying
back to Washington tonight

00:42.043 --> 00:45.679
for a major speech on
international economic policy

00:45.680 --> 00:50.283
before officers and directors of
the World Bank tomorrow morning.

00:50.284 --> 00:55.112
Bill Lawrence, ABC.
Palm Springs, California.

01:51.379 --> 01:53.380
- How are you?
- May I help you?

01:53.381 --> 01:56.411
I'm Father Duarte,
the assistant pastor.

01:57.251 --> 02:00.987
- I'm looking for Monsignor Spellacy.
- And who might you be?

02:00.988 --> 02:02.355
I might be his brother.

02:02.356 --> 02:04.991
Mr. Spellacy, Eduardo Duarte.

02:04.992 --> 02:08.527
I'm helping the Monsignor
out until he's 100 percent.

02:08.529 --> 02:09.963
He's not 100 percent?

02:09.964 --> 02:13.033
Just a matter of time, Mr. Spellacy.
Just a matter of time.

02:13.034 --> 02:15.268
As soon as I fix the
carburetor on the car,

02:15.269 --> 02:17.470
I'm gonna repaint the thermometer.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.873
We're getting the building
fund drive on the way again.

02:19.874 --> 02:22.909
The new St. Mary's is going to
be the flower of the desert.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.677
Hello, Tommy.

02:25.112 --> 02:27.313
I'm sorry, Monsignor,
for monopolizing your brother.

02:27.314 --> 02:30.517
It's just that when I talk about the
new St. Mary's, I get carried away.

02:30.518 --> 02:32.685
That's all right, Father Duarte.

02:32.686 --> 02:35.181
How are you, Tommy? Good to see you.

02:35.322 --> 02:38.191
Father Duarte said you
weren't feeling 100 percent.

02:38.192 --> 02:40.794
Oh, well, who is, Tommy? Who is?

02:40.795 --> 02:42.323
Who is?

02:42.863 --> 02:46.599
This morning after mass,
Mr. McHugh comes to see me.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.731
Nice man, Mr. McHugh.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.236
But one thing about being a pastor

02:50.237 --> 02:53.540
is that no one ever stops
by and rings your doorbell

02:53.541 --> 02:55.575
to tell you everything is just swell.

02:55.576 --> 02:57.010
So when Mr. McHugh stops by,

02:57.011 --> 02:59.479
no, it's not because he wants
to help Father Eduardo

02:59.480 --> 03:00.980
paint the thermometer outside.

03:00.981 --> 03:02.509
No, no.

03:05.686 --> 03:08.088
Mr. McHugh tells me that his
daughter, a Carmelite nun,

03:08.089 --> 03:10.890
is leaving the convent to
become a professional bowler.

03:10.891 --> 03:13.887
- What?
- I'm not kidding. A professional bowler.

03:13.894 --> 03:17.595
I didn't even know they had alleys
in the convents these days.

03:18.599 --> 03:22.135
So I said to him I'd
say a mass for her.

03:22.136 --> 03:24.996
Maybe that'll help her
bowl a perfect string.

03:26.307 --> 03:27.907
How are you, Des?

03:27.908 --> 03:29.109
Oh, it's a well-known fact

03:29.110 --> 03:32.712
the Irish have more hemorrhoids
than other people. Otherwise...

03:32.713 --> 03:35.248
Look, look, Des, I asked
you a simple question.

03:35.249 --> 03:37.650
Now, give me a straight answer.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.384
How are you?

03:42.756 --> 03:44.887
I'm gonna die, Tommy.

03:49.363 --> 03:51.426
You're not kidding.

03:55.369 --> 03:58.137
The arteries to the pump are shot.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.624
Handkerchief, Jack.

06:44.204 --> 06:45.903
Cough drop.

08:37.217 --> 08:38.551
You need a new radiator.

08:38.552 --> 08:40.479
I need a new car.

08:41.155 --> 08:43.356
Got my eye on one, believe me.

08:43.357 --> 08:45.024
Olds 98.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.693
If I hold up a gas station,
maybe I can get a down payment.

08:47.694 --> 08:49.484
Hello, fatty.

08:51.799 --> 08:55.468
It's been a while since
I've been in a $5 cathouse.

08:55.469 --> 08:58.070
I busted this joint once
when I was in vice.

08:58.071 --> 09:01.465
They had a girl. I swear
she had two left tits.

09:03.911 --> 09:06.702
Let's go. LAPD.

09:09.283 --> 09:11.847
Down at the right. On the end.

09:16.256 --> 09:17.623
Jesus!

09:17.624 --> 09:20.226
What do you want for five bucks?

09:20.227 --> 09:21.619
Hey.

09:22.596 --> 09:24.557
Been a long time.

09:25.265 --> 09:26.691
Yeah.

09:27.267 --> 09:30.703
This joint's quite a comedown from
your place in Hollywood, Brenda.

09:30.704 --> 09:33.639
I used to watch my girls do you,
fatso, through the peek.

09:33.640 --> 09:35.908
You never took off your pants.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.611
- If I did, they'd be standing in line.
- Why'd you call?

09:38.612 --> 09:40.277
Down here.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.483
Hi, Tom. You wanna play carnival?

09:43.484 --> 09:44.584
I don't know that one.

09:44.585 --> 09:47.752
I sit on your face, and you
try to guess my weight.

09:57.831 --> 10:01.362
Heart attack. When he was
committing a mortal sin.

10:02.336 --> 10:04.331
- Still warm.
- Yeah.

10:04.805 --> 10:06.402
A priest.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.270
A pastor, no less.

10:10.677 --> 10:13.445
St. Bernadette's in Redondo Beach.

10:16.884 --> 10:18.284
I know him.

10:18.285 --> 10:22.214
Father Mickey. Mickey Gagnon.
St. Bernadette's.

10:22.689 --> 10:24.657
He used to run a swell game of bingo.

10:24.658 --> 10:26.959
What's he doing in a joint like this?

10:26.960 --> 10:29.990
Getting his ashes
hauled is a good bet.

10:30.764 --> 10:34.465
A wiz at bingo. A real pain
in the ass at confession.

10:36.069 --> 10:37.737
- All right, give.
- I didn't take nothing.

10:37.738 --> 10:40.029
Just give it to me. Now!

10:46.947 --> 10:50.383
If you told him you picked your nose,
he'd give you a rosary for penance.

10:50.384 --> 10:52.584
A swell pair of shoes.

10:52.953 --> 10:55.619
All right, here you go. Come on.

10:56.456 --> 11:00.419
- How long was he here?
- It was the second one that did it.

11:08.769 --> 11:09.969
What do you think?

11:09.970 --> 11:13.535
It's gonna make a big hit with
your brother, the Monsignor.

11:47.541 --> 11:50.610
She looks like a jelly
doughnut, doesn't she?

11:50.611 --> 11:52.445
That's hardly a judicious
thing for a lawyer to say

11:52.446 --> 11:54.413
about a young bride
on her wedding day.

11:54.414 --> 11:57.516
Imagine her wearing white with
something already in the toaster.

11:57.517 --> 11:59.452
Jack, I want to tell you something.

11:59.453 --> 12:02.655
That's a little girl who'd bring
a tear to her father's eye.

12:02.656 --> 12:04.790
He was just talking about the
color of her wedding dress.

12:04.791 --> 12:07.059
Off-white, I think you
called it, right, Dan?

12:07.060 --> 12:08.894
Now, remember, Jack,
you're not losing a daughter.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.896
You're gaining a bathroom.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.798
How'd the Cardinal like
the wedding, Monsignor?

12:12.799 --> 12:14.333
He's sorry he had to leave so soon,

12:14.334 --> 12:15.401
but then he's getting on in age.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.770
He looks 100, if you ask me.

12:17.771 --> 12:21.407
And when he goes, we know who
we'd like to replace him, right, Jack?

12:21.408 --> 12:24.472
- How about some dessert?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

12:24.544 --> 12:26.846
How'd you like all the flowers
in the church, Monsignor?

12:26.847 --> 12:27.947
Very nice.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.415
- Set me back four grand.
- Imagine that.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.283
- That's a lot of goddamn roses.
- Yes, it is.

12:31.284 --> 12:34.120
Every one of them will be in
a Catholic hospital tonight.

12:34.121 --> 12:36.489
If you've got any left over,
you might think of the orphanages.

12:36.490 --> 12:39.625
Yeah. How's the champagne, Monsignor?

12:39.626 --> 12:40.960
Vintage.

12:40.961 --> 12:43.829
French vintage.
None of that California shit.

12:43.830 --> 12:44.997
Excuse my English.

12:44.998 --> 12:47.099
Hey, I'll send you a case.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.768
His Eminence too.

12:51.905 --> 12:54.306
Hey, the Cardinal
ever go to the track?

12:54.307 --> 12:56.909
Maybe he'll be my guest one day.
I'll give him a couple of tips.

12:56.910 --> 13:00.680
If Jack gives you a tip, you could
bet the Sistine Chapel on it, Des.

13:00.681 --> 13:02.682
That's how I met the
Monsignor, Counselor.

13:02.683 --> 13:03.816
- At Santa Anita.
- Oh, yeah?

13:03.817 --> 13:05.618
I gave him a tip.

13:05.619 --> 13:08.487
Orchestra leader.
Fourteen to one, huh?

13:08.488 --> 13:09.989
That's right.

13:09.990 --> 13:12.024
Well, you've got a way
with long shots, Jack.

13:12.025 --> 13:13.159
Hey, it won by six lengths.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.427
- Did he?
- Yeah.

13:14.428 --> 13:16.562
Hey, you want some more champagne?

13:16.563 --> 13:18.160
Hey, you!

13:19.633 --> 13:22.334
You two talk while I make sure
everyone's having a good time.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.159
- Okay.
- Thanks.

13:25.072 --> 13:27.135
I'm fine, thank you.

13:28.975 --> 13:32.378
Fourteen to one, huh?
Must have been a boat race.

13:32.379 --> 13:36.376
Of course it was. That's why you
could bet the Sistine Chapel on it.

13:40.887 --> 13:42.950
You look like shit.

13:44.591 --> 13:46.518
How's your wife?

13:49.029 --> 13:54.790
She left with her tuna fish
casserole recipe. Her one dish.

13:56.136 --> 13:59.837
- And your brother, the Monsignor?
- Okay.

14:01.975 --> 14:05.544
I used to listen to him on the
radio when I was in the joint.

14:05.545 --> 14:07.179
"The religious hour."

14:07.180 --> 14:10.549
I'll bet he said a novena for you
every time that you and I screwed.

14:10.550 --> 14:13.011
What's on your mind, Brenda?

14:19.025 --> 14:22.658
You ever notice how you
get old, your feet swell up?

14:23.029 --> 14:26.265
I started noticing things like
that when I was in the joint.

14:26.266 --> 14:28.934
Your feet swell up, your toenails
get little ridges on them.

14:28.935 --> 14:32.505
Well, maybe you ought to
write a book about it, all right?

14:32.506 --> 14:36.942
You ever tell your brother in confession
that Jack was paying you off?

14:36.943 --> 14:39.845
Or maybe he doesn't know
what a bagman is, your brother.

14:39.846 --> 14:43.638
They don't teach them things
like that at the seminary.

14:43.683 --> 14:46.110
What are you trying to say?

14:46.853 --> 14:51.490
You ever wonder why Jack fixed it so
that you didn't get indicted and I did?

14:51.491 --> 14:53.559
Jack wouldn't know me
if he walked into me.

14:53.560 --> 14:54.894
Forget you.

14:54.895 --> 14:57.429
It was all that business he
was doing with your brother.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.799
All those Catholic
schools he was building.

14:59.800 --> 15:01.934
It wouldn't have looked
good, you going on trial.

15:01.935 --> 15:03.235
So he put in the fix downtown.

15:03.236 --> 15:06.004
Somebody had to take the fall. Me.

15:08.642 --> 15:10.204
Anything else?

15:10.877 --> 15:13.145
Yeah. Just get that
stiff out of here.

15:13.146 --> 15:15.778
Once a bagman, always a bagman!

15:24.791 --> 15:26.922
I'm sorry about that.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.653
Okay?

15:29.029 --> 15:30.729
You know my temper.

15:30.730 --> 15:33.590
I need you like I need another fuck.

15:54.054 --> 15:58.490
You know, Jack's got this
grand new development, Des.

15:58.491 --> 16:00.392
Rancho Rosa, I think it's called.

16:00.393 --> 16:04.063
Anyway, he wants to give a little
piece to His Eminence for a school.

16:04.064 --> 16:05.898
Isn't that a grand thing to do?

16:05.899 --> 16:07.564
Rancho Rosa?

16:08.101 --> 16:10.803
I hear he's having trouble
getting rid of his lots.

16:10.804 --> 16:13.339
He needs a school and the city
won't put one in, is that true?

16:13.340 --> 16:16.208
My God, you're suspicious. Peg?

16:16.209 --> 16:17.840
Monsignor.

16:18.111 --> 16:20.479
- Mrs. Campion, how are you?
- Oh, it was a beautiful mass.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.580
Thank you.

16:29.623 --> 16:32.224
I just wanted to thank you
for everything you've done.

16:32.225 --> 16:35.261
It's a beautiful wedding,
and I wanted to tell you

16:35.262 --> 16:38.831
how much I appreciated all
your patience and time.

16:38.832 --> 16:41.500
It was an honor and I...

16:41.501 --> 16:44.736
I know that you'll be
very happy, Georgette.

16:45.205 --> 16:46.639
I'm sure of that.

16:46.640 --> 16:50.239
- Monsignor, you know why I got married.
- Yes, I do.

16:51.378 --> 16:55.079
But I wouldn't worry about it.
I think it'll be fine.

16:55.148 --> 16:59.316
I think you've done the right thing,
and you have my blessing.

17:00.754 --> 17:02.885
Thank you, Monsignor.

17:04.790 --> 17:08.260
Yeah, so, he's gotten awful grand
since he became a supervisor.

17:08.261 --> 17:10.729
I remember when you
could rent him by the day.

17:10.730 --> 17:13.065
And now, after being turned
down everywhere else,

17:13.066 --> 17:16.199
Jack makes this most
generous offer to us.

17:16.836 --> 17:19.505
What would you call that, Des?

17:19.506 --> 17:22.308
- I'd call that a pair of grape scissors.
- Oh.

17:22.309 --> 17:23.474
Have some champagne.

17:23.476 --> 17:25.678
Try that chocolate
stuff too. It's good.

17:25.679 --> 17:28.079
Stay away from the peanuts.
Bad for the bowels.

17:28.080 --> 17:30.542
I think I'll just have this.

17:34.621 --> 17:38.914
I hear Jack's overextended.
The banks want to call in his paper.

17:39.092 --> 17:42.850
Oh, you're a cool one,
Des, you really are.

17:44.597 --> 17:46.498
All right.

17:46.499 --> 17:47.733
Maybe I can persuade Jack

17:47.734 --> 17:49.902
to let his construction company
build a school at cost.

17:49.903 --> 17:51.170
How's that?

17:51.171 --> 17:53.132
- Very nice.
- Okay.

17:54.641 --> 17:57.068
You know what would even be nicer?

17:57.310 --> 17:59.771
If you threw in your fee from Jack.

18:01.681 --> 18:04.383
Looks like a leprechaun,
thinks like an Arab.

18:20.133 --> 18:21.957
Hey, look out.

19:22.028 --> 19:23.095
Hey, Des, how you doing?

19:23.096 --> 19:24.763
- Hi, Tommy. How are you?
- Good.

19:24.764 --> 19:25.964
- Nice to see you.
- Yeah.

19:25.965 --> 19:27.562
Sit down.

19:29.235 --> 19:31.837
- Nice picture of Ma.
- Yes, isn't it?

19:31.838 --> 19:33.639
Why don't you come and
visit her the next time I go?

19:33.640 --> 19:35.641
I think she'd like to see you.

19:35.642 --> 19:39.011
Last time I saw her,
she talked to me about purgatory

19:39.012 --> 19:41.246
and how much time I
was gonna spend there.

19:41.247 --> 19:43.310
Life plus 99 years.

19:45.685 --> 19:48.749
She still eating cereal
with her fingers?

19:49.222 --> 19:50.589
Well, you know, she still thinks

19:50.590 --> 19:53.659
that the early martyrs didn't
have spoons in the catacombs.

19:53.660 --> 19:57.623
Well, tell her that they didn't have
instant Cream of Wheat either.

20:01.234 --> 20:03.058
You look good.

20:04.804 --> 20:08.130
I can't complain. I got
my health, my wealth.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.938
What about yourself?

20:11.945 --> 20:13.078
I can't complain.

20:13.079 --> 20:17.145
His Eminence gives me a lot of
work, but otherwise I'm okay.

20:17.851 --> 20:19.709
I can see that.

20:22.622 --> 20:24.719
That's a sweetheart.

20:25.892 --> 20:29.252
I hear you fixed him up with
an audience with the Pope.

20:29.996 --> 20:32.628
I made some arrangements, yeah.

20:33.233 --> 20:35.057
I bet you did.

20:35.835 --> 20:37.603
Did he ever tell you
about Dominic Lopresti,

20:37.604 --> 20:39.538
that little ginzo with ambitions?

20:39.539 --> 20:42.508
He tried to move in on Jack's
construction business.

20:42.509 --> 20:46.245
So he takes him and sticks him in a
laundry dryer over at Lincoln Heights.

20:46.246 --> 20:49.413
Shrinks the poor bastard
down to 21 pounds.

20:49.849 --> 20:51.717
Is that a fact?

20:51.718 --> 20:53.886
Des, I don't know the
Holy Ghost for a fact,

20:53.887 --> 20:55.888
but you're in the
Holy Ghost business,

20:55.889 --> 20:59.818
so you tell me about the
Holy Ghost, I believe you.

21:01.461 --> 21:04.059
Which means that I
should believe you.

21:05.832 --> 21:09.601
No, meaning you wanna fall
into shit and think it's clover,

21:09.602 --> 21:11.460
then don't believe me.

21:14.607 --> 21:15.774
- Tom, I have to...
- Okay.

21:15.775 --> 21:18.076
- You know a Father Gagnon?
- Yes, I do.

21:18.077 --> 21:20.979
He's the pastor at St. Bernadette's.

21:20.980 --> 21:23.510
A wiz at bingo, they tell me.

21:28.888 --> 21:31.713
Well, could have been a house call.

21:31.824 --> 21:33.492
Well, when was the last
time you hung your pants

21:33.493 --> 21:36.762
over the back of a chair
making a house call?

21:36.763 --> 21:40.299
I gotta admit, that's not the way
they teach it at the seminary.

21:40.300 --> 21:41.700
He's out of there.
That's all that counts.

21:41.701 --> 21:43.735
Nobody's embarrassed.

21:43.736 --> 21:46.205
Well, I'll have to tell the Cardinal.

21:46.206 --> 21:50.442
Give him a great sendoff.
Candles, incense, the works.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.071
Okay.

21:55.281 --> 21:57.349
All right, I owe you one. Lunch?

21:57.350 --> 22:00.312
As long as your boss
picks up the tab.

22:02.422 --> 22:03.722
Thanks, Tom.

22:03.723 --> 22:05.854
- See you later.
- Okay.

22:43.529 --> 22:45.664
She had a nice pair of charlies.

22:45.665 --> 22:48.400
You don't often see a set
of charlies that nice.

22:48.401 --> 22:50.102
A lot of good they're
gonna do her now.

22:50.103 --> 22:51.436
Yeah.

22:51.437 --> 22:53.671
How long she been dead?

22:55.241 --> 22:58.601
10, 12 hours, maybe. I don't know.

22:58.978 --> 23:01.079
I think the butler did it.

23:01.080 --> 23:03.940
Don't you ever get
tired of saying that?

23:04.517 --> 23:06.842
- Let's see the other half.
- Yeah.

23:07.153 --> 23:09.187
- Did you hear the fights last night?
- No.

23:09.188 --> 23:11.823
Mercury Johnson,
Vinnie Avila. I was there.

23:11.824 --> 23:14.426
Like punching fog trying
to hit him, Mercury.

23:14.427 --> 23:16.228
Vinnie should have had a tire iron.

23:16.229 --> 23:18.363
He was supposed to
go in the water, Vinnie.

23:18.364 --> 23:21.633
He did. I got wet, ninth row
ringside, the splash was so big.

23:21.634 --> 23:24.670
Make sure you get a lot of tight
shots on that tattoo, okay?

23:24.671 --> 23:27.405
It's a nice touch, huh? Rose tattoo.

23:27.573 --> 23:29.541
Here's another nice touch.

23:29.542 --> 23:32.177
They found a candle
stuck up her joy trail.

23:32.178 --> 23:34.346
You ought to check it out with
your brother, the Monsignor,

23:34.347 --> 23:35.714
what it means in canon law.

23:35.715 --> 23:37.482
A church candle stuck
in a joint like that.

23:37.483 --> 23:39.851
He'll tell me too. He's got an
answer for everything, Des.

23:39.852 --> 23:41.620
- I got it Tommy, all right?
- Right.

23:41.621 --> 23:43.789
Yeah, okay, get the tattoo, huh?

23:43.790 --> 23:45.557
Did you get the tattoo?

23:45.558 --> 23:48.156
- I'm gonna take another one.
- Terrific.

23:49.662 --> 23:51.730
You got something I can use
for the first edition, Tom?

23:51.731 --> 23:53.832
Looks like a werewolf got to her.

23:53.833 --> 23:55.067
Or a vampire, huh?

23:55.068 --> 23:57.002
Well, that's an angle, Howard.

23:57.003 --> 23:59.137
I heard you mention your brother,
the Monsignor, Tom.

23:59.138 --> 24:01.206
I hear he's very tight
with the Cardinal.

24:01.207 --> 24:03.575
You might mention to him that
it would be a wonderful story

24:03.576 --> 24:05.677
if His Eminence was to say
the funeral mass, Tom.

24:05.678 --> 24:06.878
I can get him an exclusive.

24:06.879 --> 24:09.848
Front page on what it all means,
the death of this cunt.

24:09.849 --> 24:12.584
Howard, we don't even
have an ID on her yet,

24:12.585 --> 24:14.653
so we don't know if she's
a Catholic cunt or not.

24:14.654 --> 24:16.188
We can work that out later, Tommy.

24:16.189 --> 24:20.755
Well, if you want the Cardinal,
it's a factor, Howard, a definite factor.

24:24.497 --> 24:26.531
Where's the blood? I don't see any.

24:26.532 --> 24:28.834
Somebody cut somebody in half,
there ought to be a little blood.

24:28.835 --> 24:30.202
Forget the stretcher!

24:30.203 --> 24:32.070
For openers, she was
probably cut somewhere else.

24:32.071 --> 24:33.739
Probably she was sliced in a bathtub.

24:33.740 --> 24:35.507
Yeah, in a house, not an apartment.

24:35.508 --> 24:36.641
One stretcher.

24:36.642 --> 24:38.377
Why do you have to
give me a hard time?

24:38.378 --> 24:40.545
- I don't care what you wanna do.
- Hey, hey.

24:40.546 --> 24:42.547
What's going on?

24:42.548 --> 24:45.350
This asshole from the coroner's
wants her on two stretchers.

24:45.351 --> 24:47.619
Because she's in two
fucking pieces is why.

24:47.620 --> 24:50.122
And I'm telling you
it's one fucking body!

24:50.123 --> 24:53.125
I suppose she was in 14 pieces,
you'd want me to get 14 stretchers.

24:53.126 --> 24:55.560
That's exactly what I'm
telling you, asshole.

24:55.561 --> 24:56.695
- Hey, hey.
- Who you calling...

24:56.696 --> 24:58.096
Hold on.

24:58.097 --> 25:01.133
Do as he says. Two stretchers, okay?

25:01.134 --> 25:04.733
I hope this broad leaks all
over the goddamn grass!

25:08.007 --> 25:11.343
And get me a list of sex
crimes with the same MO.

25:11.344 --> 25:13.879
That'll take a while, Sergeant.

25:13.880 --> 25:16.715
What do you mean, it'll take
a while? She was cut in two.

25:16.716 --> 25:19.951
Do you think it's an
epidemic like the flu?

26:08.401 --> 26:10.692
I feel such a damn fool.

26:11.704 --> 26:14.139
Steve, I think we better go.

26:14.140 --> 26:15.634
Hello.

26:17.410 --> 26:19.411
Your Eminence.

26:19.412 --> 26:21.111
Monsignor.

26:36.596 --> 26:38.796
I never could stand that man.

26:41.133 --> 26:42.901
Tell me, Desmond,

26:42.902 --> 26:47.172
this proposal from Mr. Amsterdam
to give us land for a school,

26:47.173 --> 26:49.074
what does he want to get out of it?

26:49.075 --> 26:51.138
I suspect solvency.

26:51.611 --> 26:55.413
How many contracts have we let to
the Amsterdam Construction Company?

26:55.414 --> 27:00.481
Over the last few years,
it's been about $17 million.

27:01.487 --> 27:04.017
It would have cost around 22.

27:05.525 --> 27:09.227
For someone not so anxious
to buy a good name,

27:09.228 --> 27:11.263
it's wonderful, isn't it?

27:11.264 --> 27:15.557
It makes it easy to believe in the
infinite power of repentance.

27:18.871 --> 27:21.105
I keep hearing stories.

27:22.241 --> 27:24.168
About shortages?

27:25.845 --> 27:27.806
And other things.

27:29.749 --> 27:31.311
Yes.

27:32.585 --> 27:35.387
I think, once the Rancho Rosa
situation has been resolved,

27:35.388 --> 27:38.123
that we should really
seriously re-evaluate

27:38.124 --> 27:40.792
Mr. Amsterdam's contribution
to the archdiocese.

27:40.793 --> 27:44.119
Perhaps we should think
about phasing him out.

27:45.231 --> 27:47.999
I see. I see.

27:50.736 --> 27:52.230
I see.

27:56.409 --> 28:00.167
Nothing like a stiff for
making me crave Chinese food.

28:01.948 --> 28:04.349
You think there's something
funny about that?

28:04.350 --> 28:07.881
There's nothing funny
about that, Frank. Hell, no.

28:08.854 --> 28:11.486
- Hey, who is your friend?
- What?

28:17.263 --> 28:20.691
I busted this joint 14 times
when I was in vice.

28:26.739 --> 28:30.308
- Now I eat in here all the time.
- I can see why.

28:30.309 --> 28:33.278
He's helping me build
my motel in Culver City.

28:33.279 --> 28:35.447
I retire in two years.

28:35.448 --> 28:38.316
You know what you get from the
police department after 20 years.

28:38.317 --> 28:40.151
If you're smart,
you get Chink partners.

28:40.152 --> 28:41.853
Exactly. Exactly.

28:41.854 --> 28:43.788
You should be thinking ahead too.

28:43.789 --> 28:46.182
I'm not smart anymore.

28:49.128 --> 28:51.259
What about this girl?

28:51.998 --> 28:53.663
What girl?

28:55.034 --> 28:57.564
The one in two pieces, Frank.

29:02.208 --> 29:04.776
Tire marks. That's our best bet.

29:04.777 --> 29:07.204
Which doesn't give us much.

29:13.252 --> 29:15.076
More partners?

29:19.792 --> 29:21.159
You know...

29:21.160 --> 29:23.461
You know what we're
gonna pull in on this one?

29:23.462 --> 29:26.231
Panty sniffers, weenie flashers,

29:26.232 --> 29:28.333
guys who fall in love
with their shoes,

29:28.334 --> 29:30.902
guys who belt their hog
on the number 43 bus.

29:30.903 --> 29:34.205
What, you think I'm gonna lose any
sleep over who took this broad out?

29:34.206 --> 29:36.775
Pissing strawberries and
whipped cream, you think that.

29:36.776 --> 29:39.778
She's a nine-to-five stiff,
Tommy. No overtime.

29:39.779 --> 29:41.980
You know how we're
gonna break this one?

29:41.981 --> 29:44.382
A couple of years, they'll bring
in a guy who ran a red light.

29:44.383 --> 29:46.384
"I killed the girl," he'll say.
"What girl?" we'll say.

29:46.385 --> 29:48.953
"The girl with the rose tattoo
on her ass," he'll say.

29:48.954 --> 29:51.690
"Which one is that?" we'll say.

29:51.691 --> 29:54.016
That's how we're gonna break it.

29:56.696 --> 29:57.896
What do you think?

29:57.897 --> 30:00.290
Well, about 300 grams.

30:01.333 --> 30:03.234
- Oh, I missed it.
- You're fired!

30:03.235 --> 30:06.271
That's the fourth one in
three days you've missed.

30:06.272 --> 30:08.373
She sure looks better in one piece.

30:08.374 --> 30:11.042
...maceration considerably

30:11.043 --> 30:14.145
and separation and loss of scalp,

30:14.146 --> 30:15.814
along with a skull fracture.

30:15.815 --> 30:20.752
There appear to be wood splinters
in the scalp lacerations...

30:20.753 --> 30:23.321
- Fazenda, Lois.
- ...indicating the victim...

30:23.322 --> 30:25.023
Fazenda. Polack?

30:25.024 --> 30:27.758
...wooden instrument. Lithuanian.

30:28.327 --> 30:31.396
Her brain tissue is macerated
and dark red in color.

30:31.397 --> 30:33.765
Date of birth, February 10, 1926.

30:33.766 --> 30:35.200
Cause of death, hemorrhage...

30:35.201 --> 30:37.869
- Makes her 22.
- ...shock due to brain injuries.

30:37.870 --> 30:40.038
Twenty-two next Tuesday.

30:40.039 --> 30:43.433
I don't think she's gonna
blow out the candles.

30:48.380 --> 30:52.275
Death occurred no later than
12 hours prior to discovery.

30:54.854 --> 30:59.424
She also had undigested food
in her stomach. Egg rolls.

30:59.425 --> 31:01.326
They all do it to somebody sideways.

31:01.327 --> 31:04.494
Egg rolls. I analyzed the food.

31:07.500 --> 31:10.668
I have nothing against him
personally, Your Eminence.

31:10.669 --> 31:13.705
No, I know you don't, Seamus.

31:13.706 --> 31:16.007
But Desmond is a
very good chancellor.

31:16.008 --> 31:19.869
I think he's a better accountant
than a chancellor, sir.

31:22.014 --> 31:25.016
Seamus has just been listing
some of your shortcomings.

31:25.017 --> 31:27.085
It's a long list, Your Eminence.

31:27.086 --> 31:30.522
The Monsignor learned it by heart
when I was his curate at St. Damien's.

31:30.523 --> 31:32.824
See, I think I am owed an explanation

31:32.825 --> 31:37.262
as to why I am being replaced
as chairman of the building fund.

31:37.263 --> 31:38.630
Now, I'm owed that, eh?

31:38.631 --> 31:41.491
Yes, yes, of course you are, Seamus.

31:44.870 --> 31:46.371
We had just felt that, perhaps,

31:46.372 --> 31:49.741
you couldn't take
that much of a load.

31:49.742 --> 31:52.911
And we're very grateful to you,
Seamus. Very grateful, indeed.

31:52.912 --> 31:56.773
Oh, I marvel at your energy,
but... Excuse me.

31:58.918 --> 32:01.914
I mean, a man of your years...

32:02.521 --> 32:06.024
I'm a year younger than
you are, Your Eminence.

32:06.025 --> 32:08.190
Oh, you are, are you?

32:08.394 --> 32:11.254
Well, the race is to the swift, huh?

32:14.066 --> 32:17.995
We thought Monsignor Fitzgerald
will take over the building fund.

32:18.304 --> 32:20.605
You know, I'm not so
fond of raising money,

32:20.606 --> 32:24.375
but I think it's idiotic to
turn that job over to him.

32:24.376 --> 32:26.945
- Now, now, now, Seamus.
- His eyes twinkle.

32:26.946 --> 32:29.781
Now, you show me a priest
whose eyes twinkle all the time

32:29.782 --> 32:31.683
and I'll show you a moron.

32:31.684 --> 32:33.351
That's quite enough, Seamus.
Quite enough.

32:33.352 --> 32:35.954
But you know that I
cannot buy a new furnace.

32:35.955 --> 32:38.022
I cannot buy new desks
for the school.

32:38.023 --> 32:42.623
I can't even buy insurance for
the car without his permission.

32:43.495 --> 32:45.797
What's this we call that, Desmond?

32:45.798 --> 32:49.133
- Central purchasing, Your Eminence.
- Ah, central purchasing.

32:49.134 --> 32:52.637
I see. Well, I thought the
priority was saving souls.

32:52.638 --> 32:55.139
I don't need you to tell me
what our priorities are, Seamus.

32:55.140 --> 32:59.010
When I took over this archdiocese,
it was virtually broke.

32:59.011 --> 33:00.678
The banks now lend us money,

33:00.679 --> 33:03.281
due in no small measure to
Monsignor Spellacy here.

33:03.282 --> 33:07.382
Well, if he has his way, there'll be
pay toilets for the rectory next.

33:07.786 --> 33:13.285
Seamus, I've known you for,
what is it, 50 years now.

33:13.692 --> 33:16.688
And you were always
a pain in the neck.

33:17.062 --> 33:20.160
Now, you've had your say.
Good afternoon.

33:46.792 --> 33:49.928
Nothing today without
a reservation, I'm afraid.

33:49.929 --> 33:52.196
Monsignor Spellacy's table.

33:52.197 --> 33:54.499
I was under the impression
that Monsignor Spellacy

33:54.500 --> 33:56.935
would be lunching with Mr. Amsterdam.

33:56.936 --> 33:59.761
Well, you made a mistake, fuckhead.

34:03.676 --> 34:05.773
Right this way, sir.

34:56.762 --> 34:58.393
Monsignor.

35:02.601 --> 35:04.732
I'd like to talk to you.

35:06.705 --> 35:08.097
Bye.

35:11.844 --> 35:14.212
I'm sure I'll have a better
table in a moment, Monsignor.

35:14.213 --> 35:16.504
It's perfectly all right, John.

35:19.051 --> 35:22.487
I'll have a rob roy, straight up,
twist, thank you.

35:22.488 --> 35:24.322
And, Tommy, what would you like?

35:24.323 --> 35:28.821
A Schlitz, straight up, no twist,
as long as His Eminence is paying.

35:32.865 --> 35:35.566
- I'm so sorry, Monsignor.
- That's all right.

35:35.567 --> 35:38.036
- The usual, Monsignor?
- Yes, please. Thank you.

35:38.037 --> 35:40.134
Tommy, what would you like?

35:41.040 --> 35:44.104
- The usual will be fine for me too.
- Yes.

35:44.209 --> 35:46.943
- Whatever it is.
- You'll find out.

35:48.047 --> 35:51.015
His Eminence told me to tell
you that he was very grateful

35:51.016 --> 35:52.283
for what you did for Father Gagnon.

35:52.284 --> 35:55.451
It's nothing. Anytime, anytime.

36:01.360 --> 36:03.821
Oh, yes, I saw this before.

36:06.899 --> 36:09.030
It's a very nice photo.

36:09.935 --> 36:13.538
Well, you get your face in the paper
often enough, Des, for a priest and all.

36:13.539 --> 36:14.906
For a mick priest from Boyle Heights.

36:14.907 --> 36:18.676
No, you know, you always
were a harp with class.

36:18.677 --> 36:21.446
In fact, what are you going to call
yourself when you become pope?

36:21.447 --> 36:23.147
I don't know. I thought about it.

36:23.148 --> 36:25.650
- Maybe I'll call myself Gelasius II.
- Yeah?

36:25.651 --> 36:28.715
It has a nice little ring
to it, don't you think?

36:29.388 --> 36:31.255
Then again, it could
be something simpler.

36:31.256 --> 36:32.924
Thomas, after you.

36:32.925 --> 36:35.793
There's never been a
Pope Thomas. Thomas I.

36:35.794 --> 36:39.427
Thomas I. I like that.
It's nice and common.

36:40.666 --> 36:44.197
A constant reminder to me
that the flesh is weak.

36:45.637 --> 36:48.306
Don't give me that pious crap, Des.

36:48.307 --> 36:52.099
Not after that raffle at the
Holy Innocents last year,

36:52.845 --> 36:57.048
fixing it so that Sonny O'Meara's
daughter got that new Studebaker.

36:57.049 --> 36:59.684
No wonder you gave such a
big hello to Sonny over there.

36:59.685 --> 37:02.476
Well, what did you get out of that?

37:05.557 --> 37:08.621
Sonny's vote on the
planning commission.

37:09.228 --> 37:13.157
Got the property condemned for
the new school at Holy Innocents.

37:14.233 --> 37:17.768
Well, you should have mentioned
the name Cornelia Cronin to him.

37:17.769 --> 37:19.804
You would have saved
yourself a Studebaker.

37:19.805 --> 37:22.006
"Corky," they call her.

37:22.007 --> 37:24.041
She's a bookkeeper in
one of his funeral parlors,

37:24.042 --> 37:26.177
and she broke her back one
weekend on Sonny's boat

37:26.178 --> 37:28.878
when Mrs. Sonny was
off making a retreat.

37:29.448 --> 37:32.617
He prays a lot better on
a boat, Sonny, is what I hear.

37:32.618 --> 37:34.852
And she gets $500 a
month for life, Corky.

37:34.853 --> 37:36.053
Excuse me, sir.

37:36.054 --> 37:37.488
For the limp.

37:37.489 --> 37:40.451
- Put this on my tab, waiter.
- Yes, sir.

37:41.093 --> 37:42.760
It's all right, Jack. Thank you.

37:42.761 --> 37:46.258
No, no, no, Monsignor.
Your money's no good here.

37:49.134 --> 37:52.103
Oh, I'm sorry. Jack,
this is my brother, Tom.

37:52.104 --> 37:53.437
Jack Amsterdam.

37:53.438 --> 37:56.536
- How are you?
- I haven't had the pleasure.

37:56.975 --> 37:59.911
Got the family resemblance.
That's nice.

37:59.912 --> 38:04.342
It's nice to have an older brother.
I wish I would have had an older brother.

38:05.217 --> 38:07.718
You know, I don't hear from
you about Rancho Rosa.

38:07.719 --> 38:09.587
Well, we're doing some
new surveys, Jack.

38:09.588 --> 38:11.789
And as soon as we're finished,
we'll talk about it, okay?

38:11.790 --> 38:13.284
I see.

38:13.725 --> 38:16.594
His Eminence get the invitation to
my fundraiser at St. Veronica's?

38:16.595 --> 38:17.728
Yes, he did.

38:17.729 --> 38:19.964
- Tell His Eminence I'm counting on him.
- I will.

38:19.965 --> 38:22.800
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

38:22.801 --> 38:25.228
He's a winner, your brother.

38:25.904 --> 38:28.695
And only the winner goes to dinner.

38:31.677 --> 38:34.145
Hey, I like that.
You hear that, Monsignor?

38:34.146 --> 38:35.980
"Only the winner goes to dinner."

38:35.981 --> 38:38.408
Runs in the family, brains.

38:41.086 --> 38:43.320
I used to work for you.

38:43.855 --> 38:46.146
Oh, yeah? When was that?

38:47.359 --> 38:50.661
While you were running whores,
I was your bagman in Wilshire Vice.

38:50.662 --> 38:53.192
I did the payoffs for Brenda.

38:55.834 --> 38:58.364
I'm sure you remember Brenda.

39:01.573 --> 39:04.775
Of course, that was before
you started doing fundraisers

39:04.776 --> 39:06.839
for St. Veronica's.

39:10.082 --> 39:11.816
I gotta be going.

39:11.817 --> 39:16.645
This brother of yours is a little disturbed.
You better watch out for him.

39:48.320 --> 39:50.451
Any messages for me?

39:51.890 --> 39:53.589
Hey, Tommy.

39:54.092 --> 39:58.192
- Hey, how are you?
- Good.

39:59.231 --> 40:01.431
- Anything for me?
- No.

40:02.968 --> 40:06.037
I want you to check out all the
butcher shops, knife shops

40:06.038 --> 40:08.539
and medical suppliers, all right?

40:08.540 --> 40:10.239
Jesus, Tom.

40:19.518 --> 40:21.217
Sergeant Spellacy.

40:21.353 --> 40:23.917
Could you hold for a minute, please?

40:23.989 --> 40:26.557
- Check out the garages yet?
- Yeah.

40:26.558 --> 40:28.092
Know how many garages
there are in this town?

40:28.093 --> 40:30.961
- Fifteen hundred.
- Right.

40:30.962 --> 40:33.531
Sergeant Spellacy, may I help you?

40:33.532 --> 40:35.800
Yes, ma'am, we do want
to find that girl's killer.

40:35.801 --> 40:40.197
And you are who? Mrs. Finley.

40:40.772 --> 40:42.373
And you're from Culver City now,

40:42.374 --> 40:47.611
but you used to live
in Guin, Alabama?

40:49.014 --> 40:52.850
Now, I do what? I hard-boil an egg,
and I put it in the victim's right hand.

40:52.851 --> 40:54.352
Right.

40:54.353 --> 40:57.488
Would you please mess up
your own desk, Frank? Please?

40:57.489 --> 41:00.958
Jeez, I guess I don't have to ask you
how lunch with the Monsignor went, huh?

41:00.959 --> 41:03.928
Then I close the casket.
Right, I got that.

41:03.929 --> 41:07.460
And then in seven days,
the murderer will confess.

41:07.766 --> 41:09.600
I've got that.

41:09.601 --> 41:13.632
Yes, ma'am, it's something you
used to do in Guin, Alabama.

41:15.907 --> 41:18.107
Yes, ma'am. Thank you, ma'am.

41:18.944 --> 41:21.545
- You ever read the brassiere ads?
- No.

41:21.546 --> 41:24.882
I read them all the time.
I can pick them out.

41:24.883 --> 41:27.985
I walk down the street, I see a girl,

41:27.986 --> 41:30.121
I see the straps through her blouse

41:30.122 --> 41:32.957
and I know it's a Latrique
Latex Breathe-Easy

41:32.958 --> 41:34.625
with matching garter belt,

41:34.626 --> 41:36.086
$5.95.

41:36.628 --> 41:39.453
That's a good thing to know, Frank.

41:41.099 --> 41:43.868
- You wanna have a drink?
- No, going home.

41:43.869 --> 41:47.138
- All right. Call me. Goodbye.
- Okay. You bet.

41:49.674 --> 41:52.610
...the werewolf killer of the
"virgin tramp " continued today

41:52.611 --> 41:56.514
as police of a dozen cities in California
join the desperate manhunt.

41:56.515 --> 41:59.617
The victim, Lois Fazenda,
was revealed by police today

41:59.618 --> 42:01.652
to have been a romance seeker.

42:06.425 --> 42:07.919
Langendorf bread...

42:07.959 --> 42:09.593
Mother of God, pray for us...

42:11.863 --> 42:13.464
the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

42:13.465 --> 42:15.199
Holy Mary, mother of God,

42:15.200 --> 42:17.768
pray for us sinners, now and at
the hour of our death. Amen.

42:17.769 --> 42:19.503
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with Thee.

42:19.504 --> 42:20.638
Blessed art Thou among women.

42:20.639 --> 42:22.940
And blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

42:22.941 --> 42:25.676
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners,

42:25.677 --> 42:27.845
now and at the hour
of our death. Amen.

42:56.575 --> 42:59.844
Glory be to the Father, and to
the Son, and to the Holy Ghost.

42:59.845 --> 43:01.312
As it was in the beginning,

43:01.313 --> 43:04.844
is now and ever shall be,
world without end. Amen.

43:06.218 --> 43:09.520
This program is maintained
only by your contributions.

43:09.521 --> 43:10.888
This is your program.

43:10.889 --> 43:13.350
At any sacrifice, it must continue.

43:13.391 --> 43:16.227
This is Monsignor Spellacy
thanking you for your support

43:16.228 --> 43:19.930
and inviting you to be with us daily
as we pray the rosary for peace.

43:19.931 --> 43:23.334
May the blessing of Almighty God,
the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost

43:23.335 --> 43:26.103
descend upon you and
remain forever. Amen.

44:18.990 --> 44:20.416
Amen.

44:22.427 --> 44:25.829
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
It's been a year since my last confession.

44:25.830 --> 44:29.099
Since then I accuse
myself of impure actions.

44:30.001 --> 44:32.769
I curse a lot. I got a bad temper.

44:33.405 --> 44:34.899
And...

44:44.616 --> 44:46.349
Is that all?

44:50.455 --> 44:53.986
The other day, I embarrassed
my brother in public.

44:54.192 --> 44:58.019
For these and all the sins of
my past life, I am heartily sorry.

44:58.964 --> 45:01.599
For your penance, say ten Hail
Marys and ten Our Fathers

45:01.600 --> 45:03.934
and make an act of contrition.

45:19.684 --> 45:22.350
- Go in peace.
- Thank you, Father.

45:36.935 --> 45:40.204
- Is this the only one vice has got?
- Yep.

45:40.972 --> 45:42.873
What'd that guy say?

45:42.874 --> 45:45.976
She'd been an Arab extra
at Warner Bros., huh?

45:45.977 --> 45:48.404
- In Casablanca?
- Right.

45:56.354 --> 45:58.489
- Oh, Jesus.
- My God.

45:58.490 --> 46:00.587
Yeah. Look at that.

46:00.925 --> 46:03.352
You're spilling your coffee.

46:08.500 --> 46:10.968
Her parents claimed the body.

46:10.969 --> 46:14.363
- They're shipping it back to St. Louis.
- Right.

46:15.573 --> 46:17.363
What a waste.

46:19.310 --> 46:21.009
Who is that?

46:23.982 --> 46:26.443
Is... Isn't that...

46:27.385 --> 46:31.155
Isn't that the girl that gave
Father Mickey the great sendoff?

46:31.156 --> 46:33.754
Lorna. Lorna Keane.

47:04.756 --> 47:07.858
I paid to get half-and-half.
I should get half-and-half.

47:07.859 --> 47:08.959
But you only did half.

47:08.960 --> 47:10.694
What do you think I'm doing?
Running a white sale?

47:10.695 --> 47:14.231
- But she was in such a hurry...
- Can I help you, Officer?

47:14.232 --> 47:17.067
Here's your hat. Coat. Come on.

47:17.068 --> 47:18.268
- Okay.
- Let's go. Out.

47:18.269 --> 47:19.900
Hey, out!

47:21.106 --> 47:23.931
- You'd make a good bouncer.
- Thanks.

47:31.616 --> 47:34.510
So. How are you?

47:36.588 --> 47:38.088
Swell. In the pink.

47:38.089 --> 47:41.256
I've got a box at Santa
Anita this season.

47:42.193 --> 47:46.657
Listen, Brenda, I'm sorry about
before. I got a little carried away.

47:48.900 --> 47:50.394
Truce?

47:51.636 --> 47:53.062
Sure.

47:54.239 --> 47:56.006
Listen, I wanna talk to
that colored girl, Lorna.

47:56.007 --> 47:57.107
Is she around?

47:57.108 --> 47:58.575
- I got rid of her.
- Why?

47:58.576 --> 48:00.944
I don't like having priests
dying in my house.

48:00.945 --> 48:03.313
It's not good for business.

48:03.314 --> 48:04.982
She made a stag film.
I'd like to talk to her.

48:04.983 --> 48:06.984
Know where she went?

48:06.985 --> 48:09.419
Maybe she went to New York on
a personal appearance tour.

48:09.420 --> 48:11.555
- Why don't you ask Walter Winchell?
- Come on.

48:11.556 --> 48:16.623
- I want to find out who made this film.
- And I thought this was a social call.

48:21.800 --> 48:24.864
A guy named Standard.
Leland K. Standard.

48:25.503 --> 48:27.862
He uses a lot of my girls.

48:28.239 --> 48:30.268
Leland K. Standard.

48:30.642 --> 48:33.968
- Lois Fazenda. Did you ever know her?
- No.

48:35.613 --> 48:40.384
- Any of your girls ever talk about a cutter?
- Hard to find a girl that hasn't been cut.

48:40.385 --> 48:42.820
That's part of the risk they take.

48:42.821 --> 48:44.655
Oh, that's swell.
That's just what I want to hear.

48:44.656 --> 48:48.725
A lot of deep shit about how
tough it is being a hooker.

48:48.726 --> 48:50.288
Come on.

48:58.636 --> 49:01.305
All that time when
I was in the joint,

49:01.306 --> 49:02.873
never heard from you.

49:02.874 --> 49:05.309
Not once.

49:05.310 --> 49:08.135
Brenda, what do you expect from me?

49:11.850 --> 49:14.084
Could have sent a card.

49:14.085 --> 49:17.445
I sent you a card. I sent
you a Christmas card.

49:18.890 --> 49:21.124
With Santa Claus on it.

49:22.760 --> 49:24.254
Right.

49:29.100 --> 49:30.731
All right.

49:31.035 --> 49:32.769
- Standard.
- That's the guy. That's it.

49:32.770 --> 49:33.937
207.

49:33.938 --> 49:35.830
Right. Let's go.

49:40.445 --> 49:42.713
- What's up?
- It's ahead. Come on!

49:52.190 --> 49:53.557
Open up!

49:53.558 --> 49:55.492
Police officers. LAPD.

49:55.493 --> 49:57.694
- Open up!
- Police department.

49:57.695 --> 50:00.030
Open up. Police department.

50:00.031 --> 50:02.390
Let's go. Right? We'll try it.

50:10.041 --> 50:12.206
Tommy, be careful!

50:14.545 --> 50:16.938
Freeze, you son of a bitch!

50:48.513 --> 50:50.075
Fuck it!

50:52.116 --> 50:53.250
Right.

50:53.251 --> 50:55.686
Here. Here, drink
some water. All right.

50:55.687 --> 50:59.423
Stop crying. Here,
blow your nose, all right?

51:01.960 --> 51:05.062
- You all right?
- I'm fine. He got away with my cuffs.

51:05.063 --> 51:06.530
Jeez.

51:06.531 --> 51:08.966
Put out an APB on
that son of a bitch.

51:08.967 --> 51:11.168
Get some patrol cars to
shake down the area.

51:11.169 --> 51:14.237
- That wasn't Standard.
- Then who the hell was it?

51:14.238 --> 51:15.472
Loan shark. Standard owed him.

51:15.473 --> 51:18.901
- How much, cutie?
- Four thousand, not including the vig.

51:20.144 --> 51:21.445
Here.

51:21.446 --> 51:23.338
That's Standard!

51:23.982 --> 51:26.011
Well, that's swell.

51:26.551 --> 51:29.653
- Then where the hell is he?
- She says he's dead. I'm checking it.

51:29.654 --> 51:31.046
Dead?

51:31.322 --> 51:33.021
What? Yeah.

51:33.825 --> 51:35.649
Auto accident?

51:36.027 --> 51:38.158
A week ago Wednesday.

51:40.031 --> 51:43.459
Son of a bitch totaled his car.
Brand-new Ford.

51:43.968 --> 51:47.328
DOA, general hospital, 5:14 a.m.

51:49.440 --> 51:51.901
Who are you? What do you do?

51:52.010 --> 51:54.835
Me? I do awful good French.

52:23.541 --> 52:26.571
Do you remember why
you became a priest?

52:31.416 --> 52:33.411
I had a vocation.

52:33.484 --> 52:36.184
That's what we all say, isn't it?

52:36.454 --> 52:39.856
A vocation to love God,
help the poor,

52:39.857 --> 52:42.359
solace the sick and dying.

52:42.360 --> 52:44.025
Is that it?

52:44.962 --> 52:46.354
Yes.

52:50.835 --> 52:55.806
Well, why are you still coming back to
me for confession after all these years?

52:55.807 --> 52:59.406
- What do you get out of it?
- It's good for my soul.

53:00.578 --> 53:04.609
But you see, I have the
sin of pride. I always have.

53:05.049 --> 53:07.684
And I recognize it in you.

53:07.685 --> 53:10.249
Because you like power.

53:11.389 --> 53:14.522
You like to use power.
I've told you that.

53:14.592 --> 53:15.725
Yes, sir, I agree with you.

53:15.726 --> 53:18.829
But how could you get things
done without using it?

53:18.830 --> 53:22.265
If our business is saving souls,
then we need a place to save them.

53:22.266 --> 53:24.534
And somebody's got
to take care of that.

53:24.535 --> 53:26.826
So you're always saying.

53:27.038 --> 53:30.432
I know, but what other
choice is there?

53:30.475 --> 53:32.003
What...

53:33.044 --> 53:35.437
Well, I don't know.

53:36.047 --> 53:39.214
But just don't sell yourself short.

54:01.572 --> 54:05.275
Next time I ask you for a nine-iron,
give me a nine-iron, would you?

54:05.276 --> 54:07.077
He gave you the seven
because the last time

54:07.078 --> 54:09.412
you birdied the hole
with a seven, Dan.

54:09.413 --> 54:11.748
Was I playing with you?

54:11.749 --> 54:14.517
Mind your own business, would you?

54:23.628 --> 54:27.197
I keep reading about your
brother, the policeman, Des,

54:27.198 --> 54:30.865
in the newspapers about
this "virgin tramp" business.

54:31.402 --> 54:33.670
Well, it's the Virgin Mary
they should be writing about.

54:33.671 --> 54:35.962
Don't you think so, Des?

54:39.544 --> 54:41.334
That's right.

54:42.747 --> 54:44.915
Well, people are bored.
The war is over.

54:44.916 --> 54:48.617
They have to have something
to sink their teeth into.

54:49.453 --> 54:53.484
But he's a grand policeman.
That's what they tell me.

55:00.898 --> 55:03.723
Is he making any progress, I wonder?

55:06.504 --> 55:08.829
We've got to unload Jack.

55:26.057 --> 55:28.358
It's not as if Jack's done
anything illegal, Des.

55:28.359 --> 55:30.422
No, only profitable.

55:31.229 --> 55:34.164
It's been going on too long. It's a
full-time job, looking the other way.

55:34.165 --> 55:36.660
He's got to go and that's it.

55:37.001 --> 55:40.403
I don't think you want to get
on the wrong side of him.

55:40.404 --> 55:43.138
Why don't you leave that up to me?

55:48.112 --> 55:53.042
Wasn't there a run-in recently between
Jack and your brother, the policeman?

55:54.418 --> 55:56.653
What about it?

55:56.654 --> 55:59.489
You let Jack go now,
what's it going to look like?

55:59.490 --> 56:00.924
And what about Rancho Rosa?

56:00.925 --> 56:03.727
Forget Rancho Rosa.
That's not going to happen.

56:03.728 --> 56:07.122
Oh, that's going to be
very difficult, Des.

56:07.732 --> 56:10.267
No more difficult than it
was for you to pension off

56:10.268 --> 56:13.303
Cornelia Cronin, her name was?

56:13.304 --> 56:15.595
Otherwise know as Corky.

56:16.707 --> 56:19.771
That was a Christian
thing to do, Sonny.

56:30.021 --> 56:32.422
I think I can get Neddy
Flynn to bid against Jack

56:32.423 --> 56:36.493
on that contract for the new
orthopedic wing at St. John's Hospital.

56:36.494 --> 56:37.594
That's perfect.

56:37.595 --> 56:39.963
Neddy loves getting his
bones broken, I hear.

56:39.964 --> 56:41.598
Oh, no, no, no, no.

56:41.599 --> 56:43.500
There's lots of grand
ways to handle it, Dan,

56:43.501 --> 56:47.270
so as Jack's feelings don't
get hurt, is what I mean.

56:47.271 --> 56:49.664
We could give him a dinner.

56:52.343 --> 56:54.644
Catholic Layman Of The Year?

56:54.645 --> 56:57.573
That's grand, Des. That's just grand.

59:32.504 --> 59:33.838
May I help you, young man?

59:33.839 --> 59:36.574
Mrs. Phil Spellacy. I know the way.

59:36.575 --> 59:38.576
You'll have to wait.
She's receiving communion.

59:38.577 --> 59:41.505
May all your sons be Jesuits, Sister.

59:48.754 --> 59:51.352
Who is that come in, Monsignor?

59:52.291 --> 59:55.219
- Is that you, Tom?
- Yeah. Here you go.

59:55.961 --> 59:58.058
Brought me something!

59:58.797 --> 01:00:02.533
- Good to see you. How are you?
- Bad breath, Thomas.

01:00:02.534 --> 01:00:05.169
- Are you still constipated?
- Oh, every day.

01:00:05.170 --> 01:00:07.738
The Monsignor here
recommends the castor oil.

01:00:07.739 --> 01:00:11.065
And listen to the Monsignor, Thomas.

01:00:12.611 --> 01:00:14.946
You remembered my favorite color.

01:00:14.947 --> 01:00:18.011
What's this with the
orange bow on here?

01:00:19.651 --> 01:00:21.686
He has grand grammar.

01:00:21.687 --> 01:00:25.156
Always had to wash your
mouth out with soap.

01:00:25.157 --> 01:00:29.260
- The dirty words.
- Okay, Ma, let's forget about that, okay?

01:00:29.261 --> 01:00:31.162
Wouldn't it be grand

01:00:31.163 --> 01:00:36.127
if you had turned out to be
a nun like the younger one.

01:00:36.468 --> 01:00:40.037
I'm a priest, Ma.
I think I'm a priest.

01:00:40.038 --> 01:00:42.329
And a swell one too.

01:00:43.442 --> 01:00:48.479
Tom, has Moira received
first holy communion?

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:51.182
Yeah, about 12 years ago, Ma.

01:00:51.183 --> 01:00:53.178
That's grand, Tom.

01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:57.755
Spell out the holy
days of obligation.

01:00:57.756 --> 01:00:59.023
And start at the beginning.

01:00:59.024 --> 01:01:02.026
There's a rap on the knuckles if
you don't start at the beginning.

01:01:02.027 --> 01:01:04.228
What's the beginning?

01:01:04.229 --> 01:01:05.663
Well, Immaculate Conception.

01:01:05.664 --> 01:01:08.592
- Immaculate...
- Try Immaculate Conception.

01:01:10.435 --> 01:01:13.604
- I-M-M-A...
- I-M... Immaculate.

01:01:13.605 --> 01:01:16.073
- That's the hard part.
- ...C...

01:01:16.074 --> 01:01:18.909
Conception is a snap once you
know your C's from your S's.

01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:23.214
Will you let me finish?
U-L-A-T-E. Okay?

01:01:23.215 --> 01:01:26.814
- You're a much better speller now, Tom.
- I hope so.

01:01:27.252 --> 01:01:29.253
You used to have trouble
with your vowels.

01:01:29.254 --> 01:01:32.717
A, E, I, O, U. Sometimes Y.

01:01:37.029 --> 01:01:39.058
Conception, Thomas.

01:01:39.965 --> 01:01:41.789
Mind your C's.

01:01:45.570 --> 01:01:46.771
Hello, Sister.

01:01:46.772 --> 01:01:49.807
I didn't think she'd
talk about your breath.

01:01:49.808 --> 01:01:52.176
Yeah, a grand speller like yourself.

01:01:52.177 --> 01:01:56.447
- I'll give you a ride back to the chancery.
- That's C-H-A-N-C-E-R-Y.

01:01:56.448 --> 01:01:58.511
Yeah, you're right.

01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:09.060
Remember Uncle Eddie's wake
when Aunt Jenny asked Pa

01:02:09.061 --> 01:02:13.698
what Uncle Eddie was really like after
all, because he knew him so well.

01:02:13.699 --> 01:02:18.002
Pa looks down at Eddie's casket and
looks up at Aunt Jenny and says,

01:02:18.003 --> 01:02:20.771
"Well, he was a good shoveler, Jenny.

01:02:20.772 --> 01:02:24.475
"Not a fancy shoveler, mind you,
but a good shoveler."

01:02:24.476 --> 01:02:27.006
High praise from the old man.

01:02:29.081 --> 01:02:32.049
One thing about the old man,
he never missed a wake.

01:02:32.050 --> 01:02:34.511
Free booze and plenty of it.

01:02:38.190 --> 01:02:41.559
- Ever feel like doing something?
- Sure, let's do that.

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:44.161
- Let's...
- Maybe Saturday?

01:02:44.162 --> 01:02:47.698
Saturday? Well, I have my
golf game on Saturday, but...

01:02:47.699 --> 01:02:49.296
Oh, okay.

01:02:51.570 --> 01:02:53.771
Well, I'll cancel it if it's
the only day you have.

01:02:53.772 --> 01:02:57.735
No. No, that's okay.
It'll interfere with your golf game.

01:02:58.043 --> 01:03:01.345
- I'll change it.
- No, just forget about it.

01:03:01.346 --> 01:03:03.247
- Tommy, I can change it.
- No.

01:03:03.248 --> 01:03:05.607
Just forget it, okay?

01:03:06.418 --> 01:03:08.481
Another time.

01:03:09.554 --> 01:03:14.291
But I just... I'll...
I'll... Never mind.

01:03:51.630 --> 01:03:53.497
It would behoove you, Seamus,

01:03:53.498 --> 01:03:58.064
to remember that I'm running this
archdiocese, not Monsignor Spellacy.

01:03:58.537 --> 01:04:00.905
Well, I respect that, Your Eminence.

01:04:00.906 --> 01:04:04.275
It's just that this
archdiocese has become so...

01:04:04.276 --> 01:04:05.709
I don't know.

01:04:05.710 --> 01:04:07.978
Every day, I'm feeling
less like a priest

01:04:07.979 --> 01:04:12.383
and more like an employee
of a construction company.

01:04:12.384 --> 01:04:14.652
Yes, well, I want you at
that luncheon, Seamus.

01:04:14.653 --> 01:04:18.823
I suppose I could pick up a few
pointers about the cement business.

01:04:18.824 --> 01:04:20.455
Yes, Seamus.

01:04:20.692 --> 01:04:23.119
As you wish, Your Eminence.

01:04:23.662 --> 01:04:25.224
Desmond?

01:04:39.044 --> 01:04:42.177
Sit yourself there,
Desmond. Sit yourself.

01:04:50.021 --> 01:04:52.482
I'm afraid he'll have to go.

01:05:00.999 --> 01:05:02.066
Do you mean that...

01:05:02.067 --> 01:05:04.001
I mean he'll have to
be replaced, Desmond.

01:05:04.002 --> 01:05:07.794
And don't look as if you'd
never heard the word before.

01:05:10.442 --> 01:05:13.310
Well, I think you're making
a mistake, Your Eminence.

01:05:13.311 --> 01:05:15.169
Oh, is that so?

01:05:18.817 --> 01:05:22.780
I don't mean to be disrespectful,
but I think that he's

01:05:24.155 --> 01:05:25.289
a good priest.

01:05:25.290 --> 01:05:28.526
He runs the best parish in the
archdiocese, and he's a good man.

01:05:28.527 --> 01:05:30.494
Yes, of course, he's a good man.

01:05:30.495 --> 01:05:33.697
But the fact is we
need younger pastors.

01:05:33.698 --> 01:05:36.523
That's the long and the short of it.

01:05:37.302 --> 01:05:40.070
Men who will do what they're told.

01:05:41.172 --> 01:05:43.599
For the good of the Church.

01:05:45.377 --> 01:05:46.769
Yes.

01:05:47.512 --> 01:05:51.748
For the good of Holy Mother Church,
that's exactly what I mean.

01:05:52.417 --> 01:05:56.983
So will you just find out
what his needs are?

01:06:04.462 --> 01:06:08.493
I'm sure you'll be able to find
a place for him, Monsignor.

01:06:09.367 --> 01:06:13.501
And perhaps it will be a lesson
to some of the other pastors.

01:06:19.110 --> 01:06:21.207
As you wish, Your Eminence.

01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:24.913
You know, you said
that exactly like him.

01:06:25.350 --> 01:06:28.352
Well, you may as well
know it now as never.

01:06:28.353 --> 01:06:30.220
You'll find you'll have a
few unpleasant things to do

01:06:30.221 --> 01:06:32.250
when you become a bishop.

01:06:33.525 --> 01:06:37.761
You know, of course, there's an
opening for an auxiliary bishop.

01:06:37.762 --> 01:06:39.893
I've recommended you.

01:06:40.332 --> 01:06:44.625
And I strongly suspect that Rome
will accept the recommendation.

01:06:45.103 --> 01:06:49.464
And then, perhaps, you'll find
an ambitious young monsignor

01:06:51.176 --> 01:06:53.706
to do the dirty work for you.

01:06:54.713 --> 01:06:58.244
- That's all, thank you.
- Thank you, Your Eminence.

01:07:06.024 --> 01:07:09.893
There's an opening for a
chaplain at St. Francis Hospital.

01:07:09.894 --> 01:07:11.320
Nope.

01:07:12.530 --> 01:07:14.765
I can't think of anything better.

01:07:14.766 --> 01:07:18.502
Well, there's a parish in
the desert. St. Mary's.

01:07:19.604 --> 01:07:22.039
Yes, but that's in the middle
of nowhere, Monsignor.

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:24.274
Yes, I like the desert.

01:07:25.543 --> 01:07:30.303
- Well, then, consider it done.
- Thank you, Monsignor. Thank you.

01:07:31.850 --> 01:07:34.218
Goodbye, Monsignor.

01:07:34.219 --> 01:07:36.146
Bye, Monsignor.

01:07:39.391 --> 01:07:41.056
I'm sorry.

01:07:43.261 --> 01:07:45.222
Goodbye, Desmond.

01:09:04.743 --> 01:09:06.510
Is it true you're dating
Sabu, the elephant boy?

01:09:06.511 --> 01:09:08.444
Are you going to see Sabu in New
York when the picture opens?

01:09:08.446 --> 01:09:10.314
- No comment.
- When's the last time you saw him?

01:09:10.314 --> 01:09:12.716
- No comment.
- Is it true you were seen...

01:09:12.716 --> 01:09:15.314
- Here you are.
- Oh, thank you.

01:09:15.587 --> 01:09:18.947
Was that June Haver or June Havoc?

01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:20.858
I don't know.

01:09:20.859 --> 01:09:23.286
I always get them mixed up.

01:09:23.627 --> 01:09:27.227
You know, my baby always
wanted to be a movie star.

01:09:27.832 --> 01:09:29.800
She had the smile for it.

01:09:29.801 --> 01:09:32.669
- She loved Bing Crosby.
- She wore braces until she was 17.

01:09:32.670 --> 01:09:36.874
- Going My Way was her favorite movie.
- And a retainer after that.

01:09:36.875 --> 01:09:40.176
Only at night, the retainer.
Never on dates.

01:09:40.178 --> 01:09:43.580
See, 10:00, she had to
be home, date nights.

01:09:43.581 --> 01:09:46.984
She just popped her retainer back in.

01:09:46.984 --> 01:09:51.455
She wrote poems. See,
that's the kind of girl Lois was.

01:09:51.456 --> 01:09:53.189
Here.

01:09:54.459 --> 01:09:56.283
She wrote this.

01:09:56.728 --> 01:10:01.031
"Remember me and keep in mind

01:10:01.032 --> 01:10:04.067
"a faithful friend is hard to find

01:10:04.068 --> 01:10:05.630
"But..."

01:10:06.938 --> 01:10:08.364
Here.

01:10:10.008 --> 01:10:13.377
"But when you are good and true

01:10:13.378 --> 01:10:16.238
"trade not the good ones for the new"

01:10:19.918 --> 01:10:21.952
- When did...
- Lois.

01:10:21.953 --> 01:10:23.481
Lois...

01:10:24.355 --> 01:10:29.558
- How did you get a hold of this?
- She left it last time she was home.

01:10:29.928 --> 01:10:31.094
When was that?

01:10:31.095 --> 01:10:33.764
Thanksgiving. She said
she was up for a part.

01:10:33.765 --> 01:10:35.930
Yeah, that's when it was.

01:10:36.167 --> 01:10:39.069
I'd like to keep the poem,
if you don't mind.

01:10:39.070 --> 01:10:41.705
Handwriting can be very
useful in a case like this.

01:10:41.706 --> 01:10:46.067
- She might have written to...
- The son of a bitch that killed her.

01:11:56.147 --> 01:11:58.506
Shit's gonna hit the fan.

01:11:59.550 --> 01:12:03.320
I went over every bill of his
and every bill on every phone

01:12:03.321 --> 01:12:06.089
in every apartment she's
lived in the last year.

01:12:06.090 --> 01:12:08.824
Fifty-three times she called him.

01:12:09.994 --> 01:12:12.228
So he was screwing her.

01:12:12.964 --> 01:12:14.097
She did that a lot.

01:12:14.098 --> 01:12:17.299
That's what she did for a living,
somebody said. So?

01:12:18.469 --> 01:12:21.135
Does he make you nervous, Frank?

01:12:23.074 --> 01:12:25.842
You thought about your
brother, the Monsignor?

01:12:25.843 --> 01:12:28.373
I've thought about him a lot.

01:12:29.747 --> 01:12:31.742
Sergeant Spellacy.

01:12:32.216 --> 01:12:34.518
Come on, I'd love to see you
drop him, but not on this one.

01:12:34.519 --> 01:12:35.619
He was screwing her, wasn't he?

01:12:35.620 --> 01:12:38.021
Of course, he was screwing her,
but he didn't kill her.

01:12:38.022 --> 01:12:39.756
We're going to find
that out, aren't we?

01:12:39.757 --> 01:12:42.292
Look, he's old, Jack.
He's gonna die soon.

01:12:42.293 --> 01:12:44.027
- He's got cancer.
- Yeah?

01:12:44.028 --> 01:12:46.396
- You didn't know that, did you?
- No, I didn't.

01:12:46.397 --> 01:12:48.332
Well, if you don't
believe me, check it out.

01:12:48.333 --> 01:12:51.501
He shook hands with the Pope.
How many pimps can say that?

01:12:51.502 --> 01:12:53.270
Oh, well, that's some big deal.

01:12:53.271 --> 01:12:55.405
Believe me,
he's crazier than you are.

01:12:55.406 --> 01:12:57.007
He's crazy enough to be dangerous.

01:12:57.008 --> 01:12:59.742
Yeah? Well, thank you very much.

01:13:00.445 --> 01:13:03.513
Well, just think of it as
my going-away present.

01:13:03.514 --> 01:13:05.475
I'm leaving town.

01:13:06.417 --> 01:13:08.150
You're what?

01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:12.222
- Yeah, I'm leaving town.
- Why?

01:13:12.223 --> 01:13:16.323
I did a scrape a couple of days ago.
I made a mistake. I...

01:13:17.962 --> 01:13:20.998
I nipped her. She hemorrhaged.

01:13:20.999 --> 01:13:22.366
Well, did she die?

01:13:22.367 --> 01:13:26.003
No. She's one of my old girls.
She'll keep her mouth shut.

01:13:26.004 --> 01:13:27.704
It's just one of those things.

01:13:27.705 --> 01:13:30.607
You never used to
do scrapes, did you?

01:13:30.608 --> 01:13:32.170
Happens.

01:13:32.577 --> 01:13:35.072
- You get old.
- Yeah.

01:13:36.714 --> 01:13:39.380
So where do you think you'll go?

01:13:39.684 --> 01:13:42.214
Well, you know, I don't know.

01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:45.884
Can I give you a
reference or something?

01:13:47.725 --> 01:13:50.755
I've never had any
trouble buying cops.

01:13:51.362 --> 01:13:53.152
That's funny.

01:13:55.833 --> 01:13:58.201
I just wanted to say goodbye.

01:13:58.202 --> 01:14:01.471
It's nice to have somebody
to say goodbye to.

01:14:01.472 --> 01:14:03.607
Who have I got?

01:14:03.608 --> 01:14:05.609
Lieutenant-Governor?
What am I gonna do?

01:14:05.610 --> 01:14:09.971
Call him up and say, "Hey, remember me?
You used to be a regular"?

01:14:18.823 --> 01:14:22.392
Pat says to Mike, "What are
you digging a hole for?"

01:14:22.393 --> 01:14:25.162
And Mike says to Pat,
"I'm not digging a hole.

01:14:25.163 --> 01:14:28.098
"I'm digging the dirt
and leaving a hole."

01:14:31.235 --> 01:14:32.803
But speaking seriously,

01:14:32.804 --> 01:14:36.006
I remember that day,
and it was not so long ago,

01:14:36.007 --> 01:14:40.043
when the creditors were banging
at the doors of this archdiocese,

01:14:40.044 --> 01:14:43.677
when, as the saying goes,
we didn't have a pot to

01:14:43.815 --> 01:14:45.377
spit in.

01:14:46.617 --> 01:14:48.051
When we had buildings to build,

01:14:48.052 --> 01:14:51.054
churches and schools,
and convents and hospitals,

01:14:51.055 --> 01:14:53.824
and not a copper penny
to build them with.

01:14:53.825 --> 01:14:56.026
It was then, at that dire moment,
when His Eminence

01:14:56.027 --> 01:14:59.563
asked our designee as
Catholic Layman Of The Year

01:14:59.564 --> 01:15:01.298
if he could help us out.

01:15:01.299 --> 01:15:05.626
I think all of you know what he said.
"Yes," said Jack Amsterdam.

01:15:24.689 --> 01:15:26.923
If I might add a
personal note here...

01:15:26.924 --> 01:15:28.658
Brenda was right.

01:15:28.659 --> 01:15:31.061
Amsterdam was in St. John's
Hospital getting treatment

01:15:31.062 --> 01:15:33.592
the night Fazenda was killed.

01:15:33.831 --> 01:15:36.292
And that's beat me in golf.

01:15:38.102 --> 01:15:42.133
Gentlemen, the Catholic Layman
Of The Year, Jack Amsterdam.

01:16:10.134 --> 01:16:12.197
How's your drink?

01:16:12.904 --> 01:16:14.432
Scotch?

01:16:16.274 --> 01:16:18.708
You'll never get a sash, Frank.

01:16:18.709 --> 01:16:22.779
You're not a pimp. You've got to be
a rich pimp, to get a sash like that.

01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:23.847
Yeah.

01:16:23.848 --> 01:16:27.083
You're a cop, not a
pillar of the community.

01:16:34.559 --> 01:16:37.160
Don't worry about him. He... Jack.

01:16:37.161 --> 01:16:39.462
Monsignor. Are you being taken
care of? Can I help you?

01:16:39.463 --> 01:16:40.864
Sonny's getting our coats, thank you.

01:16:40.865 --> 01:16:44.834
By the way, have you made a
decision on Rancho Rosa yet?

01:16:44.835 --> 01:16:48.471
We haven't, Jack, but I think we're
gonna do some serious reevaluation.

01:16:48.472 --> 01:16:52.367
I think we should talk about
it another time. Good night.

01:16:55.246 --> 01:16:58.348
- Des, how are you doing?
- Hi, Tommy.

01:16:58.349 --> 01:16:59.449
Good to see you.

01:16:59.450 --> 01:17:01.218
- This is Dan Campion.
- Hi.

01:17:01.219 --> 01:17:06.218
What I wonder is if you were wearing
this when you were banging Lois Fazenda.

01:17:10.995 --> 01:17:12.329
You're a real asshole, you know?

01:17:12.330 --> 01:17:14.064
Come on, Jack! Come on, Jack!

01:17:14.065 --> 01:17:16.266
What are you doing?

01:17:16.267 --> 01:17:18.668
Tommy, get back!

01:17:18.669 --> 01:17:19.803
What the hell are you doing?

01:17:19.804 --> 01:17:21.605
Goddamn you! Come back here!

01:17:21.606 --> 01:17:23.032
Jack!

01:17:23.641 --> 01:17:25.976
- Knock it off!
- Hey, you!

01:17:25.977 --> 01:17:27.811
What are you doing? Just get back!

01:17:27.812 --> 01:17:29.512
Get him out of here!

01:17:29.513 --> 01:17:30.981
- Come on.
- Come back here!

01:17:30.982 --> 01:17:32.582
- Come over here.
- Jack, Jack...

01:17:32.583 --> 01:17:34.578
Come on. Let's go.

01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:37.988
Come on. Let go of me, will you?

01:17:37.989 --> 01:17:39.889
Get your hands off me,
you rotten bastard.

01:17:39.890 --> 01:17:41.791
That's enough! Come on.

01:17:41.792 --> 01:17:44.461
- That's enough.
- Get out of my way.

01:17:44.462 --> 01:17:47.356
You hear me? You're a son of a bitch!

01:17:48.666 --> 01:17:50.433
Come on back!

01:17:51.702 --> 01:17:54.527
All right, all right. Come on, Dan.

01:19:20.758 --> 01:19:24.194
Too much wine in the chalice
again this morning, Mr. Toomey.

01:19:24.195 --> 01:19:27.191
Yes, Monsignor. Sorry, Monsignor.

01:19:30.301 --> 01:19:33.436
What I don't need in the
mornings is a stiff pick-me-up.

01:19:33.437 --> 01:19:34.904
Sorry, Monsignor.

01:19:34.905 --> 01:19:37.673
That's all right. Run along, boys.

01:19:43.180 --> 01:19:46.883
Future missionaries, Des.
Future of the church, if you ask me.

01:19:46.884 --> 01:19:49.018
God help the church.

01:19:49.019 --> 01:19:50.787
You know how to handle them,
that's for sure.

01:19:50.788 --> 01:19:54.057
I don't think there's anything
you can't handle. I mean it.

01:19:54.058 --> 01:19:57.394
- What's on your mind, Dan?
- A little breakfast.

01:19:57.395 --> 01:20:00.864
Creamed chipped beef on toast down
at The Biltmore. What do you think?

01:20:00.865 --> 01:20:04.134
Sorry, no, I can't.
I'm busy, Dan. Very busy.

01:20:06.337 --> 01:20:09.299
- Well, I can have a word with you.
- Sure.

01:20:09.507 --> 01:20:11.365
- Here?
- Why not?

01:20:15.746 --> 01:20:19.716
I was thinking about your
brother, the policeman.

01:20:19.717 --> 01:20:21.951
Got a hell of a temper.

01:20:23.454 --> 01:20:25.915
He was an altar boy, was he?

01:20:26.557 --> 01:20:28.882
That wasn't his line, no.

01:20:32.263 --> 01:20:35.131
I suppose he's still working
on that... That girl's murder?

01:20:35.132 --> 01:20:37.834
- The virgin something-or-other, was it?
- Tramp.

01:20:37.835 --> 01:20:39.500
That's it.

01:20:41.839 --> 01:20:44.274
Well, you remember her,
don't you, Des?

01:20:44.275 --> 01:20:46.839
- Remember who, Dan?
- That girl.

01:20:48.112 --> 01:20:51.245
We met her. Don't you
remember? You and I?

01:20:51.649 --> 01:20:53.650
We were coming back from
Del Mar last summer.

01:20:53.651 --> 01:20:55.748
Went to the track...

01:20:56.454 --> 01:21:00.156
She was hitchhiking. We picked
her up. Gave her a ride, I mean.

01:21:00.157 --> 01:21:02.459
She was Christian Science.
Don't you remember?

01:21:02.460 --> 01:21:06.321
You asked her about it.
She was sitting in the back seat.

01:21:07.531 --> 01:21:09.526
Christian Science?

01:21:13.037 --> 01:21:16.372
You mean the one who didn't
know who Mary Baker Eddy was?

01:21:16.373 --> 01:21:18.834
- That was her?
- That's right.

01:21:23.247 --> 01:21:24.946
Well, we...

01:21:26.283 --> 01:21:28.949
We got to be friends, she and I.

01:21:40.664 --> 01:21:44.234
Des, if it comes out we were friendly,
it's going to be embarrassing.

01:21:44.235 --> 01:21:46.901
You know what I'm talking about?

01:21:53.177 --> 01:21:56.246
I was in San Diego the night that
girl was killed. I was with Peg.

01:21:56.247 --> 01:21:59.182
We were at the regional meeting
of the Knights of Columbus.

01:21:59.183 --> 01:22:00.848
I'm clean.

01:22:07.758 --> 01:22:10.925
You have to have a
talk with your brother.

01:22:12.396 --> 01:22:13.890
Des...

01:22:14.298 --> 01:22:17.897
It's Jack I'm worried about.
He knew her too.

01:22:20.771 --> 01:22:25.132
- We had a talk, Jack and I.
- Oh, you did? Really?

01:22:25.709 --> 01:22:28.945
I suppose you told him I was a warm,
personal friend of Miss Fazenda's?

01:22:28.946 --> 01:22:30.346
No, I didn't put it
exactly like that.

01:22:30.347 --> 01:22:33.383
Oh, you didn't put it exactly
like that. Of course not.

01:22:33.384 --> 01:22:37.387
- Jack thinks your brother's crazy.
- Well, he very well might be right.

01:22:37.388 --> 01:22:39.588
Des, I'm 57 years old.

01:22:40.324 --> 01:22:42.225
Yes, you're 57 years old.

01:22:42.226 --> 01:22:43.993
You're worried about your
picture in the paper

01:22:43.994 --> 01:22:45.628
when they take you for questioning.

01:22:45.629 --> 01:22:48.998
Just remember something, Monsignor.
You were there the day we met her.

01:22:48.999 --> 01:22:51.631
Yes, we met her. You fucked her.

01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:08.751
You know, she really got
around the archdiocese,

01:23:08.752 --> 01:23:10.987
your pal with the tattoo.

01:23:10.988 --> 01:23:14.382
The lawyer, right?
Catholic Layman Of The Year?

01:23:16.193 --> 01:23:20.088
She comes home from the track
with the Monsignor himself.

01:23:22.833 --> 01:23:27.661
There's going to be an awful lot of red
faces if this policeman does his duty.

01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:38.815
That wasn't the only reason
I came to talk to you.

01:23:38.816 --> 01:23:40.481
Sure, Des.

01:23:42.052 --> 01:23:44.020
I'm sorry you don't understand that.

01:23:44.021 --> 01:23:47.415
Well, whatever you say.

01:23:48.959 --> 01:23:50.886
I just wanted...

01:23:51.629 --> 01:23:53.829
I wanted to also talk.

01:23:57.201 --> 01:24:00.231
- Why is that?
- Because you're my brother.

01:24:00.838 --> 01:24:04.266
If I can't talk to you,
I can't talk to anyone.

01:24:04.508 --> 01:24:05.934
Okay.

01:24:07.311 --> 01:24:10.808
Something's gotta change
in my life. I'm... I'm not...

01:24:11.115 --> 01:24:14.350
I'm tired of fixing things.
I'm tired of

01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:18.747
getting involved with...

01:24:44.915 --> 01:24:46.649
You wanna eat something?
A piece of pie?

01:24:46.650 --> 01:24:49.418
No, I don't want anything, thanks.

01:25:07.471 --> 01:25:09.432
Watch your heads!

01:25:14.078 --> 01:25:16.403
Come on, girls. Let's go!

01:25:27.491 --> 01:25:30.426
It was just a way of
making a buck, that movie.

01:25:30.427 --> 01:25:32.462
That's all it was.

01:25:32.463 --> 01:25:34.560
I never even saw it.

01:25:37.801 --> 01:25:39.659
What about her?

01:25:42.873 --> 01:25:45.775
I never even saw her
before that movie.

01:25:45.776 --> 01:25:48.135
And I never saw her since.

01:25:48.779 --> 01:25:51.343
All I remember is that tattoo.

01:25:52.483 --> 01:25:56.085
She said she got it from
some guy down in Long Beach.

01:25:56.086 --> 01:25:59.355
Didn't cost her nothing,
just a piece of ass.

01:26:00.657 --> 01:26:03.482
Boy, did Standard like that tattoo!

01:26:04.862 --> 01:26:08.689
He was a freak, Standard.
He belonged in a zoo.

01:26:09.733 --> 01:26:11.728
Where was his zoo?

01:26:12.636 --> 01:26:15.037
Out in El Segundo.

01:26:15.038 --> 01:26:16.973
An old army barracks.

01:26:16.974 --> 01:26:20.107
Looks like a goddamn
freak show out there.

01:26:21.945 --> 01:26:24.236
All right, look at this.

01:26:25.315 --> 01:26:27.242
That's Standard.

01:26:28.952 --> 01:26:31.413
- All right.
- When did he die?

01:26:35.893 --> 01:26:38.252
Compared to when she died.

01:26:39.429 --> 01:26:41.063
It's the night before.

01:26:41.064 --> 01:26:43.833
- He had 11 hours to kill her.
- Son of a bitch.

01:26:43.834 --> 01:26:48.171
He killed her, dumped her at
the lot, then he totals the Ford.

01:26:48.172 --> 01:26:50.030
Son of a bitch.

01:32:19.069 --> 01:32:21.530
Sergeant Spellacy, Homicide.

01:32:23.106 --> 01:32:24.930
Where are you?

01:32:27.043 --> 01:32:29.140
Right. I'll be right there.

01:32:35.152 --> 01:32:38.444
- What happened?
- Gas. She just turned it on.

01:32:39.289 --> 01:32:43.252
She had enough gas in her room
to blow up half of East LA.

01:32:53.270 --> 01:32:55.128
It's over here.

01:32:57.207 --> 01:32:58.940
Eighty-four.

01:33:03.346 --> 01:33:05.011
That's it.

01:33:34.578 --> 01:33:38.514
One of the girls said the last person
she called was Jack Amsterdam.

01:33:38.515 --> 01:33:42.581
I don't know what she wanted,
but I'd say she didn't get it.

01:34:05.508 --> 01:34:07.309
Let's get him, Frank.

01:34:07.310 --> 01:34:09.144
She's a suicide.

01:34:09.145 --> 01:34:10.946
Then we'll get him
for the Fazenda girl.

01:34:10.947 --> 01:34:12.281
You know Standard killed her.

01:34:12.282 --> 01:34:15.584
You just came back from the barracks!
You know Jack didn't do it.

01:34:15.585 --> 01:34:17.519
Well, then, his lawyer will
get him off, won't he?

01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:18.621
You can't do it.

01:34:18.622 --> 01:34:19.788
- I can.
- No, you can't do it.

01:34:19.789 --> 01:34:21.523
You're just trying to
settle up an old score.

01:34:21.524 --> 01:34:23.525
What about your brother?
It's his ass too.

01:34:23.526 --> 01:34:25.394
What are you trying to prove,
that he's just like you?

01:34:25.395 --> 01:34:26.889
He is. He's your brother.

01:35:03.967 --> 01:35:05.666
Are you all right?

01:35:05.735 --> 01:35:08.560
Cut the crap. I don't have all day.

01:35:09.606 --> 01:35:11.674
It's been 20 years since
my last confession.

01:35:11.675 --> 01:35:14.102
I had a lot of things to do.

01:35:18.248 --> 01:35:19.982
You're not gonna say anything?

01:35:19.983 --> 01:35:23.185
The way it goes,
you're supposed to tell me.

01:35:23.186 --> 01:35:24.578
Yeah.

01:35:26.723 --> 01:35:28.251
Well...

01:35:29.192 --> 01:35:33.656
I'm a married man, but I gotta admit,
I knew a few girls in my time.

01:35:38.001 --> 01:35:39.791
Nothing else?

01:35:40.637 --> 01:35:43.972
- I got into arguments with some guys.
- How do you define "arguments"?

01:35:43.973 --> 01:35:45.607
Who the hell are you to
ask all these questions?

01:35:45.608 --> 01:35:46.875
I'm your confessor.

01:35:46.876 --> 01:35:50.045
You're my confessor in here, but you
wheel and deal out there, is that it?

01:35:50.046 --> 01:35:52.780
- You're in here now.
- Yeah, I know.

01:35:57.921 --> 01:36:00.589
- Is that all?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's all.

01:36:00.590 --> 01:36:03.759
- Are you sorry for your sins?
- Sure, I'm sorry for my sins.

01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:04.860
For your penance...

01:36:04.861 --> 01:36:06.729
- I know, I know.
- ...pray a rosary and make...

01:36:06.730 --> 01:36:10.466
I don't know why you did that to me.
I thought we were friends.

01:36:10.467 --> 01:36:13.068
Now, you did that Rancho Rosa deal,

01:36:13.069 --> 01:36:15.704
and then you paid me off
with that green sash.

01:36:15.705 --> 01:36:18.701
And another thing,
about your brother...

01:36:18.842 --> 01:36:20.234
Amen.

01:36:20.243 --> 01:36:21.908
Go in peace.

01:36:22.278 --> 01:36:25.280
Open that screen! Open it up!

01:36:25.281 --> 01:36:27.750
You keep him off my fucking back.

01:36:27.751 --> 01:36:28.984
He's trying to drop that whore on me.

01:36:28.985 --> 01:36:30.753
I can't help it if he was
on the take, your brother.

01:36:30.754 --> 01:36:32.888
Nobody twisted his arm.

01:36:32.889 --> 01:36:35.991
You tell him if he grabs me, it's your
ass gonna be in the sling, not mine.

01:36:35.992 --> 01:36:37.726
I'm clean. Not his. Yours.

01:36:37.727 --> 01:36:40.291
You're a priest. A priest!

01:36:40.897 --> 01:36:43.966
And you knew that whore,
and you never told anyone.

01:36:43.967 --> 01:36:47.930
Now, you ask your brother how
that's gonna look in the newspapers.

01:36:49.339 --> 01:36:52.233
Who absolves you, huh?

01:36:52.809 --> 01:36:54.736
Who absolves you?

01:36:56.980 --> 01:36:58.847
I got a family.

01:36:58.848 --> 01:37:01.383
There's a scholarship named after me.

01:37:01.384 --> 01:37:03.152
I met the Pope, for Christ sakes.

01:37:03.153 --> 01:37:06.013
You understand, you hypocrite?

01:37:54.370 --> 01:37:58.162
What are you doing giving
absolution to that mick pimp?

01:37:58.608 --> 01:38:00.705
I want to know that.

01:38:01.978 --> 01:38:03.336
Why?

01:38:07.984 --> 01:38:12.448
- Do you want me to hear your confession?
- I've got nothing to tell.

01:38:18.428 --> 01:38:20.195
Oh, yeah, all right. Okay. All right.

01:38:20.196 --> 01:38:22.831
I wanted to say that your pal,
Jack, is kind of in the shit,

01:38:22.832 --> 01:38:25.862
is the reason I'm here.
We're gonna pick him up.

01:38:25.902 --> 01:38:29.037
I don't wanna embarrass
you or the Cardinal.

01:38:29.038 --> 01:38:32.796
He's in a state of grace,
and I'll let him enjoy it. All right?

01:38:33.309 --> 01:38:36.178
I thought you'd want to be prepared.
You saw his picture in the paper.

01:38:36.179 --> 01:38:39.243
I don't wanna do anything
behind your back.

01:38:40.884 --> 01:38:42.742
Yes, thank you.

01:38:46.623 --> 01:38:48.720
Thank you very much.

01:38:50.793 --> 01:38:53.323
This is for the Fazenda girl?

01:38:53.796 --> 01:38:55.998
- Yes.
- So he...

01:38:55.999 --> 01:38:58.000
Passed her around like a
piece of Christmas candy

01:38:58.001 --> 01:38:59.301
while you were out playing golf.

01:38:59.302 --> 01:39:01.303
- Listen...
- Did he do it?

01:39:01.304 --> 01:39:03.572
- Catholic Layman Of The Year.
- Did he do it, Tommy?

01:39:03.573 --> 01:39:07.434
- Highest honors bestowed on that...
- Tommy, did he do it?

01:39:08.244 --> 01:39:11.680
I don't care whether he killed her!
I don't give a shit!

01:39:11.681 --> 01:39:13.642
I just don't care!

01:39:18.021 --> 01:39:19.686
That's it.

01:39:20.423 --> 01:39:24.090
And I don't care whether you
go down with him or not.

01:39:35.838 --> 01:39:37.628
Neither do I.

01:39:49.552 --> 01:39:51.342
Neither do I.

01:39:59.095 --> 01:40:02.531
Will you continue as
Chancellor of the archdiocese?

01:40:02.532 --> 01:40:05.323
Give us a break, fellows.
Give us a break.

01:40:05.802 --> 01:40:07.336
Have you spoken to the Cardinal...

01:40:07.337 --> 01:40:09.161
Hey, step away!

01:40:11.574 --> 01:40:14.843
You can tell me why the Cardinal
refused to make any comment?

01:40:14.844 --> 01:40:17.669
What are your plans for the future?

01:40:56.986 --> 01:40:59.117
I'm gonna die, Tommy.

01:41:01.290 --> 01:41:04.058
The arteries to the pump are shot.

01:41:05.928 --> 01:41:07.525
Sit down.

01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:25.306
Yeah.

01:41:37.894 --> 01:41:40.253
It's all right. I'm ready.

01:41:42.131 --> 01:41:45.127
As they say, my bags are packed.

01:41:59.582 --> 01:42:01.076
How...

01:42:07.957 --> 01:42:09.554
I'll sing...

01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:12.088
I'll...

01:42:18.835 --> 01:42:21.933
I'll sing an Irish
song at your funeral.

01:42:26.309 --> 01:42:28.270
With my voice...

01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:33.314
I'll wake you up again.

01:42:38.354 --> 01:42:40.019
It's okay.

01:42:54.937 --> 01:42:58.106
It must have been hard,
Des. I mean...

01:42:58.107 --> 01:42:59.931
No, it wasn't.

01:43:00.710 --> 01:43:03.211
I never had a great
gift for loving God,

01:43:03.212 --> 01:43:07.582
and Seamus told me that
that was not a drawback

01:43:07.583 --> 01:43:10.545
as long as I could
make myself useful.

01:43:13.523 --> 01:43:16.690
He taught me the meaning
of being a priest.

01:43:19.595 --> 01:43:22.420
And there's a kind of peace in that.

01:43:32.642 --> 01:43:35.877
It's my fault, Des, all of it.
Every bit of it.

01:43:35.878 --> 01:43:37.543
I'm sorry.

01:43:41.951 --> 01:43:45.954
No, Tommy. You were
my salvation, actually.

01:43:45.955 --> 01:43:50.158
You made me remember
things that I had forgotten.

01:43:50.159 --> 01:43:53.053
I thought I was someone who I wasn't.

01:44:02.371 --> 01:44:04.696
I saved a plot over there.

01:44:06.843 --> 01:44:09.611
I hope when the time comes that...

01:44:11.047 --> 01:44:15.584
Out here? In the middle
of all this goddamn sand?

01:44:15.585 --> 01:44:18.513
I don't know. I don't know.

01:44:18.754 --> 01:44:20.453
I tell you.

01:44:21.057 --> 01:44:23.621
But I guess it's...

01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:27.886
I guess one place is about
as good as another.

01:44:39.942 --> 01:44:41.402
This is it.

01:44:41.878 --> 01:44:43.543
This is it?
