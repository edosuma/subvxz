00:38.931 --> 00:41.045
You don't find it odd
that we're the only racers

00:41.070 --> 00:42.154
on this road right now?

00:42.179 --> 00:43.695
Heart might be an evil corporation,

00:43.720 --> 00:46.195
but their tech is top notch.

00:46.220 --> 00:48.020
I feel like Slink is up to something.

00:48.055 --> 00:51.853
Like drugging up someone else's sister
and making them go crazy?

00:52.761 --> 00:54.594
I'm gonna kill you, master of mayhem.

00:54.619 --> 00:57.086
- Grace.
- Sixth stage of grief.

00:57.121 --> 00:58.754
- Revenge.
- Okay, there's no way

00:58.789 --> 01:00.422
for me to know what you're going
through right now,

01:00.457 --> 01:04.180
but I need you to stay with me
on this one, okay?

01:07.598 --> 01:09.765
That's the first cop car
I've seen in ages.

01:11.535 --> 01:13.167
Make sure your seatbelts are on.

01:13.203 --> 01:15.094
- I got this.
- Perfect timing.

01:15.253 --> 01:17.386
We need fuel.

01:32.221 --> 01:34.371
Relax, Barbie.

01:34.396 --> 01:35.692
It's just a cop.

01:35.717 --> 01:37.634
You speak the language.

01:47.135 --> 01:49.534
Afternoon. You folks in a hurry?

01:49.570 --> 01:51.203
Yeah, sorry, officer.

01:51.239 --> 01:53.372
We're just, uh, trying to
make up some time

01:53.407 --> 01:54.923
in the back roads.

01:54.994 --> 01:56.593
Everything all right?

01:56.629 --> 01:57.962
Uh, yes, sir.

01:57.997 --> 01:59.530
Right as rain.

01:59.565 --> 02:03.203
Just, uh, been a long haul.

02:03.468 --> 02:05.953
And you, ma'am? You okay?

02:08.139 --> 02:10.674
Oh, yeah, I'm absolutely fine, sir.

02:10.709 --> 02:12.142
- Thanks.
- Uh, you know,

02:12.177 --> 02:15.967
I have a lot of respect for the badge.

02:16.214 --> 02:17.513
Los Angeles.

02:17.549 --> 02:20.182
Damn shame what they did to that force.

02:20.217 --> 02:23.385
Turning them into a bunch of
clock-punching civilians.

02:23.420 --> 02:26.103
You're a long way from Los Angeles.

02:26.390 --> 02:28.322
Where you headed?

02:29.081 --> 02:32.215
Uh, Red River.

02:32.329 --> 02:33.628
What's your business there?

02:33.664 --> 02:35.664
- We under arrest?
- Not yet.

02:35.700 --> 02:38.132
But I clocked you at 92 per.

02:38.168 --> 02:40.168
Right, um, and like I said,

02:40.203 --> 02:44.305
- I'm so sorry, um...
- I could use some help.

02:44.340 --> 02:46.040
- Police help.
- Oh, we'd love to.

02:46.076 --> 02:47.709
But like you said,
we're really in a rush.

02:47.744 --> 02:50.477
Young lady, there's only one road

02:50.513 --> 02:52.080
and it runs right through Red River

02:52.115 --> 02:53.480
and I'm the Sheriff of Red River.

02:53.516 --> 02:56.216
Things starting to add up yet?

02:56.251 --> 03:01.021
Yes, either we help you out
or we don't pass.

03:01.056 --> 03:02.322
Straight up the road.

03:02.357 --> 03:04.157
Three more miles.

03:04.193 --> 03:07.160
There's a garage off to your right.

03:07.196 --> 03:08.661
Park there.

03:13.067 --> 03:15.367
Let's blow through.
I'll do a little backup work.

03:15.402 --> 03:17.369
How long can it really take?

03:19.707 --> 03:22.574
Too much of a pussy
to kill me yourself, Slink?

03:22.610 --> 03:24.343
Master of mayhem, my ass.

03:24.378 --> 03:27.030
More like masturbator of yourself.

03:27.215 --> 03:29.214
Who else is he supposed to masturbate?

03:30.717 --> 03:33.417
I am getting so sick of this race.

03:52.084 --> 03:56.421

<font color="#0080ff">www.</font>addic7ed<font color="#0080ff">.com</font>

05:17.351 --> 05:19.484
I wonder why they don't let cars in.

05:19.519 --> 05:22.454
Maybe it's cause they've heard
that some cars eat people.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.489
Ow.

05:24.524 --> 05:26.391
Did you feel that?

05:26.426 --> 05:29.460
- EMP.
- That's electromagnetic pulse.

05:29.495 --> 05:31.462
It disables anything
with an electric charge.

05:31.497 --> 05:33.164
That's right.

05:33.199 --> 05:35.699
Sheriff Leon has me run
an EMP device at all times.

05:35.735 --> 05:37.634
Creates a barrier around the town.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.203
There's no power allowed in Red River.

05:39.239 --> 05:42.340
Cars end up just stalling out.

05:42.375 --> 05:44.507
Not sure why it did that
to your necks, though.

05:47.445 --> 05:50.513
What is it, MacGyver?

05:50.548 --> 05:51.514
Brain bombs.

05:57.256 --> 05:58.821
Never seen tech like this.

05:58.857 --> 06:00.323
Hey, be careful with those.

06:00.359 --> 06:01.924
If they power back up, they can explode.

06:01.959 --> 06:04.659
These things are
right against your spine.

06:04.695 --> 06:05.928
Who did this to you?

06:05.963 --> 06:08.497
Someone you don't wanna know.

06:08.532 --> 06:11.233
No way.

06:11.269 --> 06:13.668
You've gotta be kidding me.

06:15.539 --> 06:17.706
My God, do you know what this is?

06:17.741 --> 06:20.608
This is a New Fusion.

06:20.643 --> 06:23.378
This is a beta of
a nuclear-powered sedan.

06:23.413 --> 06:25.346
They only made 12.

06:25.382 --> 06:27.448
Oh, wowzers.

06:27.483 --> 06:30.451
- Wowzers?
- What's so special about it?

06:30.486 --> 06:32.720
Gets a million miles to the charge.

06:32.755 --> 06:35.255
A million? To one charge?

06:35.291 --> 06:36.523
It only takes one charge.

06:36.558 --> 06:38.225
It's nuclear-powered.

06:38.260 --> 06:39.526
Do you know, Terry, I've been looking

06:39.561 --> 06:40.560
for one of these for a long time.

06:40.595 --> 06:41.861
So why didn't you sell it?

06:41.897 --> 06:44.398
It's gotta be worth a fortune.

06:44.433 --> 06:45.865
This vehicle is a once-in-a-lifetime

06:45.901 --> 06:48.635
sort of thing, you don't sell it.

06:48.670 --> 06:49.769
You admire it.

06:56.577 --> 06:57.944
- Hey, there.
- You girls done

06:57.979 --> 07:01.213
kissing each other?

07:01.249 --> 07:03.749
- Town's this way.
- Hey, if it's okay

07:03.784 --> 07:05.651
with you guys, I think
I'm gonna stay here

07:05.686 --> 07:07.553
and see if I can make myself useful.

07:07.588 --> 07:09.720
I like you, lady.

07:09.756 --> 07:12.924
Being useful is the best thing
you can be.

07:12.960 --> 07:14.592
Let's go.

07:14.627 --> 07:17.262
It started with The Scar.

07:17.297 --> 07:21.266
That God damn rip created
all kinds of horrible shit.

07:21.301 --> 07:24.235
People got sick, went crazy.

07:24.271 --> 07:27.904
Took me a while.
I finally figured it out.

07:27.940 --> 07:29.440
We were getting our electricity

07:29.475 --> 07:31.008
from the Worktel power grid,

07:31.043 --> 07:33.844
part of which hung over The Scar.

07:33.879 --> 07:36.913
Whatever evil was seeping
out of that wound,

07:36.949 --> 07:38.915
was getting to us
through the power lines.

07:38.951 --> 07:40.284
What do you mean, evil?

07:40.319 --> 07:41.518
I cut the lines.

07:41.553 --> 07:43.252
Thought that would solve it.

07:43.288 --> 07:45.421
But the sickness was already here.

07:45.457 --> 07:47.423
- So what do you need from us?
- Well, the sickness

07:47.459 --> 07:48.858
got into some of the townsfolk,

07:48.893 --> 07:51.027
twisted them up inside.

07:51.062 --> 07:53.429
Started using electricity as a weapon.

07:53.465 --> 07:55.931
Cattle prods, Tasers.

07:55.967 --> 08:00.435
Only way to stop them
was to fire up a juice killer.

08:00.471 --> 08:03.038
Ain't got no juice,
they ain't a threat no more.

08:03.073 --> 08:05.773
So you have a pretty solid way
of keeping them out.

08:05.809 --> 08:10.045
- What's the problem?
- They're more of them now.

08:10.080 --> 08:11.813
And I'm hearing they're fixing
to come back

08:11.848 --> 08:13.615
and finish what they started.

08:13.650 --> 08:15.783
But they don't know your face.

08:15.819 --> 08:17.818
Now, you could sneak into their camp,

08:17.853 --> 08:19.053
shut down their power source,

08:19.088 --> 08:21.022
then I could stop them for good.

08:21.057 --> 08:23.357
Undercover work.

08:23.393 --> 08:24.858
You up for it?

08:24.894 --> 08:26.860
Do I really have a choice?

08:29.732 --> 08:32.633
You're welcome to get
cleaned up at the hotel.

08:32.668 --> 08:35.034
I'll meet you at the police
station in an hour.

08:52.453 --> 08:53.885
Enjoy.

08:53.921 --> 08:55.454
Thank you.

09:01.529 --> 09:02.994
I can get used to this.

09:03.030 --> 09:04.430
Maybe stay here a while.

09:04.465 --> 09:06.898
Sure beats the inside of a Camaro.

09:18.545 --> 09:21.011
<i>Get off!</i>

09:21.047 --> 09:22.012
Aah!

09:22.048 --> 09:25.015
Karma's dead.

09:25.051 --> 09:27.717
All I know is she fought like a warrior.

09:28.753 --> 09:30.853
Grace!

09:33.892 --> 09:37.860
- Barbie?
- Yes?

09:37.896 --> 09:41.531
Why don't you come in here a minute?

09:41.567 --> 09:44.633
I can hear you fine from out here.

09:44.668 --> 09:47.403
Come on, we've already
crossed that threshold.

10:00.450 --> 10:03.951
Wanna cross it again?

10:03.987 --> 10:07.622
You can't fuck the pain away.

10:09.493 --> 10:11.726
No harm in trying.

10:11.761 --> 10:14.562
Plus, I feel free.

10:14.598 --> 10:16.130
And I like it.

10:19.001 --> 10:20.567
And I'm horny.

10:23.972 --> 10:25.172
Grace.

10:25.207 --> 10:26.906
Yeah?

10:33.948 --> 10:36.449
- I like you.
- You do?

10:36.484 --> 10:38.518
- I do.
- Mm-hmm.

10:38.553 --> 10:41.521
- But...
- But what?

10:44.159 --> 10:48.661
If sex is your drug of choice,

10:48.696 --> 10:51.763
I don't wanna be your fix.

10:53.667 --> 10:55.800
Why do you always
have to overthink everything,

10:55.835 --> 10:57.669
Arthur Bailey?

10:57.704 --> 11:00.872
Sometimes it's fun to just...

11:00.907 --> 11:02.807
act.

11:19.158 --> 11:21.192
Suit yourself.

11:42.246 --> 11:44.213
What he hell?

11:51.255 --> 11:52.754
Wait!

11:52.789 --> 11:53.988
What happened here?

12:01.130 --> 12:05.233
Been living in Red River
for... ten years.

12:05.268 --> 12:07.835
My partner and I moved here
to get away from it all,

12:07.870 --> 12:11.539
but then The Scar happened, and...

12:11.574 --> 12:14.074
- Things got weird?
- Yeah.

12:14.110 --> 12:16.576
Can you give me a 9/16?

12:19.147 --> 12:21.848
Yeah, sure.

12:21.883 --> 12:23.850
Here.

12:23.885 --> 12:25.518
So what happened to your friend, anyway?

12:25.554 --> 12:27.887
Split or died.

12:27.922 --> 12:29.889
Not sure which. Doesn't matter, I guess.

12:29.924 --> 12:32.191
I'm alone.

12:32.227 --> 12:34.727
Being alone's not too bad, I guess.

12:34.762 --> 12:37.596
Gives me time to tinker with my babies.

12:37.632 --> 12:40.532
Not too proud to say it.

12:40.568 --> 12:42.635
Not a lot of people like me.

12:42.670 --> 12:46.037
Think I'm weird for some reason.

12:47.308 --> 12:49.574
So who cares?

12:49.609 --> 12:53.110
I'm gonna be alone,
I might as well be alone here.

12:53.146 --> 12:55.280
Yeah...

12:55.315 --> 12:57.982
I'm alone, too.

13:04.857 --> 13:07.324
Whiskey. Any brand.

13:07.359 --> 13:09.159
We don't serve any alcohol here.

13:09.194 --> 13:11.628
The sheriff won't allow it.

13:11.664 --> 13:13.029
So what the hell do you serve?

13:13.064 --> 13:14.264
Espresso.

13:14.300 --> 13:15.999
You read the sign, right?

13:16.034 --> 13:18.168
- Just espresso?
- Just espresso.

13:18.203 --> 13:20.136
Unwashed Ethiopian peaberry.

13:20.172 --> 13:24.674
Fire cracked and sun soaked
for exactly 37 hours.

13:24.709 --> 13:26.041
Wait, what? Oh, sorry.

13:26.076 --> 13:28.344
You lost me when you said
no fuckin' whiskey.

13:28.379 --> 13:30.045
Care to repeat it?

13:30.080 --> 13:33.115
- Unwashed Ethiopian peaberry...
- Rhetorical.

13:37.154 --> 13:39.689
I hear you wanna kill me.

13:42.726 --> 13:43.958
You're gonna sit down

13:43.993 --> 13:45.627
and watch me drink this whiskey

13:45.662 --> 13:48.630
until the bottle's empty.

13:48.665 --> 13:51.633
Then you die.

13:51.668 --> 13:53.368
That's my girl.

14:02.165 --> 14:03.595
You're late.

14:06.167 --> 14:09.401
Here's the rebel power station.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.149
Defenses?

14:11.174 --> 14:12.876
Electrified fencing all around it.

14:12.901 --> 14:14.946
We won't get close enough to strike

14:14.971 --> 14:16.237
while they still have juice.

14:16.272 --> 14:19.907
Put those on... they'll kill you
if they see they uniform.

14:19.942 --> 14:23.877
We send you to the front gate
with a power pack.

14:23.913 --> 14:25.346
You need a charge.

14:25.381 --> 14:29.216
Use your city boy charm.
Get 'em to let you in.

14:29.251 --> 14:30.883
What do I do once I get inside?

14:30.919 --> 14:33.720
Hook up your pack.
That'll shut down their power.

14:33.755 --> 14:37.090
Defenses go dark, we go in.

14:41.863 --> 14:44.230
You're gonna arrest them, right?

14:44.265 --> 14:46.232
That's up to them.

14:50.070 --> 14:52.771
Right on cue.

14:52.806 --> 14:55.174
- I need your help.
- Of course you do.

14:55.209 --> 14:58.110
I'm a little busy here, Arthur.

14:58.456 --> 15:01.255
I'm not sure the Sheriff
is playing us card up.

15:01.290 --> 15:03.979
Yeah? He's probably not.

15:04.327 --> 15:06.503
No one is.

15:07.273 --> 15:10.968
It's feeling like a two man job.

15:11.132 --> 15:13.400
I can't help you, Barbie.

15:13.536 --> 15:17.204
You see, Slink and I have
some unfinished business.

15:19.407 --> 15:22.308
Saddle up, boys! Let's ride out!

15:23.745 --> 15:26.112
He really is a handsome devil, isn't he?

15:26.147 --> 15:27.547
Mm.

15:35.289 --> 15:37.089
<i>Police bought the shit
when they sold our contracts</i>

15:37.124 --> 15:39.558
<i>to a private company.</i>

15:39.594 --> 15:42.695
- We used to be cops, remember?
- We still are.

15:42.730 --> 15:45.063
- We're still the good guys.
- People are afraid.

15:45.099 --> 15:47.099
Good, fear keeps them in line.

15:56.476 --> 15:58.576
<i>I need help. Please help me.</i>

15:58.612 --> 16:00.244
Calm down, ma'am. Tell me where you are.

16:00.279 --> 16:02.246
<i>Aah, they're coming!</i>

16:02.281 --> 16:04.081
<i>They're gonna eat me.</i>

16:41.152 --> 16:43.418
Don't know you, stranger.

16:43.453 --> 16:45.486
I'm not from here and I'm not staying.

16:45.522 --> 16:48.089
I'm from the west,
trying to get past The Scar.

16:48.124 --> 16:49.991
How'd you get through Red River?

16:50.027 --> 16:53.494
I didn't. Left my car at a garage.

16:53.530 --> 16:55.263
I need to charge my power pack.

16:55.289 --> 16:58.800
Person there said this is the only
place with juice for 100 miles.

16:58.835 --> 17:01.268
We don't trade
with people we don't know.

17:01.303 --> 17:04.503
I've got water.

17:04.540 --> 17:06.807
Distilled from the Pacific Northwest.

17:09.511 --> 17:11.444
How much power do you need?

17:16.851 --> 17:19.051
Then you move on?

17:19.087 --> 17:22.221
Then I move on.

17:22.256 --> 17:25.191
So why don't you trade with Red River?

17:25.226 --> 17:27.026
They don't have any electricity at all.

17:27.061 --> 17:29.829
Are you trading or asking questions?

17:29.864 --> 17:31.130
Just curious.

17:33.068 --> 17:35.333
We don't care for Red River folks.

17:35.368 --> 17:39.204
Least of all, Sheriff Leon.

17:39.239 --> 17:41.740
Where'd you say you're from again?

17:41.775 --> 17:44.142
I didn't.

17:44.177 --> 17:46.745
I'm from the California Territory.

17:46.780 --> 17:49.715
What do you do for work?

17:49.750 --> 17:53.084
I was a mailman.

17:53.119 --> 17:56.487
Yeah. That seems right.

17:56.522 --> 17:59.356
This way. Come on.

18:27.096 --> 18:29.775
So what happened between you
and Sheriff Leon?

18:31.923 --> 18:34.126
Soon as you're full, you're gone.

18:48.237 --> 18:50.872
You killed us!

19:03.752 --> 19:06.437
Pick him up. Get him back to town.

19:06.605 --> 19:08.272
All right, you've got the upper hand.

19:08.323 --> 19:10.045
Now why don't we just pull some
wire back to Red River

19:10.070 --> 19:13.195
- and turn the power back on?
- After the trial.

19:13.829 --> 19:16.461
Tell your men to take it easy.
These are families.

19:16.497 --> 19:20.132
He's right. Don't rough 'em up too much.

19:20.168 --> 19:24.101
We want them to be awake
when their necks snap.

19:24.505 --> 19:27.472
Time to build the gallows, boys.

19:32.698 --> 19:36.016
Seems like you already know how
the trial's gonna end, Sheriff.

19:36.158 --> 19:38.688
Punishment has to fit the crime.

19:39.276 --> 19:41.475
They haven't been convicted
of a crime yet.

19:41.500 --> 19:43.303
You made it sound like
these people were monsters,

19:43.328 --> 19:45.727
but they barely even fought back.

19:46.573 --> 19:48.407
Talk to me.

19:48.508 --> 19:50.341
You're not a cop.

19:50.377 --> 19:53.450
You're barely half a man
and I'm done with you.

19:53.475 --> 19:56.510
Now you shut your hole
and shove off, pretty boy.

19:56.545 --> 20:00.513
Unless you want a turn
at the end of a rope.

20:23.403 --> 20:25.537
Look what I found.

20:25.572 --> 20:26.872
A cunt cop.

20:26.907 --> 20:28.340
Fellas, I don't want any trouble.

20:29.609 --> 20:32.910
- Trouble is what you found.
- As an employee of ContraCrime,

20:32.946 --> 20:34.879
I'll be forced to place you
under arrest.

20:37.350 --> 20:39.550
ContraCrime is dead, dumbass.

20:39.585 --> 20:41.418
There ain't no laws no more.

20:41.454 --> 20:42.887
What the hell are you talking about?

20:42.922 --> 20:43.955
Where is everybody?

20:43.990 --> 20:45.589
They split,

20:45.624 --> 20:47.858
like your head's gonna be.

20:47.893 --> 20:49.559
That's not true.

20:49.594 --> 20:51.294
I'm not gonna lie,

20:51.330 --> 20:53.763
tearing this city apart was fun as hell.

20:53.798 --> 20:56.867
But now, it runs in those
fracking tubes.

20:56.902 --> 21:00.270
And there's no one left to play with.

21:00.305 --> 21:01.804
Until now.

21:01.840 --> 21:03.974
This is gonna hurt a lot!

21:11.349 --> 21:13.315
You okay, bro?

21:13.351 --> 21:14.449
Yo, you okay?

21:14.485 --> 21:15.650
Aah!

21:36.773 --> 21:40.507
I see you've engaged
your retinal security protocol.

21:40.542 --> 21:41.841
What's happening to me?

21:41.877 --> 21:44.544
- You're becoming.
- Becoming what?

21:48.517 --> 21:51.451
I don't wanna hurt you.

21:51.486 --> 21:55.088
Christopher, I wasn't
programmed with any emotions.

21:55.124 --> 21:57.523
Only to mimic them when it was needed.

21:57.558 --> 22:00.592
But when you told me you...

22:00.628 --> 22:03.129
loved me...

22:03.164 --> 22:04.830
something happened.

22:04.865 --> 22:06.966
When you left this morning,
I missed your presence,

22:07.001 --> 22:09.501
your warmth.

22:09.537 --> 22:11.804
I missed you.

22:11.839 --> 22:15.974
I didn't even understand what
that phrase meant until now.

22:16.009 --> 22:19.510
I don't know how to explain what I feel.

22:19.546 --> 22:22.613
But I think the human word for it is...

22:26.186 --> 22:27.618
Love.

22:27.654 --> 22:31.121
Ah. Is this one of your tricks?

22:43.769 --> 22:46.803
No.

22:46.839 --> 22:50.406
I'm here for you.

22:50.442 --> 22:51.707
I'll take care of you.

23:45.260 --> 23:47.027
Hey, Grace, you need any help?

23:47.062 --> 23:50.030
- Nope.
- Well, I do... bad.

23:50.065 --> 23:53.799
Officer Bailey, will you very
kindly fuck off!

23:53.835 --> 23:55.767
Look, this town isn't so great.

23:55.802 --> 23:58.137
The Sheriff is a sociopath
and I just helped him

23:58.172 --> 24:00.472
grab up a bunch of innocent
people whose only crime

24:00.508 --> 24:01.706
was trying to be free.

24:01.742 --> 24:03.208
No can do, Barbie.

24:03.244 --> 24:04.943
You're on your own.

24:04.978 --> 24:07.112
He's gonna kill a kid, Grace.

24:07.148 --> 24:09.614
Please. What if this was Karma?

24:09.650 --> 24:12.116
Karma's dead. Okay?

24:12.152 --> 24:15.486
So you go fight your own demons.

24:15.522 --> 24:19.123
I'll fight mine.

24:19.159 --> 24:20.758
I...

24:23.029 --> 24:24.828
Can't let you do this, Sheriff.

24:24.864 --> 24:26.630
I ain't asking you.

24:26.666 --> 24:28.066
You know this isn't right.

24:28.101 --> 24:30.733
I ain't taking life advice
from a tin star.

24:30.769 --> 24:35.972
Out here, justice is in the hand
of the man holding the gun.

24:36.007 --> 24:37.807
And it's swift.

24:40.112 --> 24:42.079
You would shoot an unarmed cop?

24:42.114 --> 24:43.613
You ain't a cop.

24:43.648 --> 24:47.483
You're just some asshole in a costume.

24:47.518 --> 24:50.486
Tell the hangman, grab another rope.

24:50.521 --> 24:52.488
We got one more coming.

24:52.523 --> 24:54.190
Come on, come on.

24:59.011 --> 25:00.927
Unwashed Ethiopian peaberry.

25:01.029 --> 25:03.481
Fire cracked and sun soaked

25:03.622 --> 25:05.431
for exactly 37 hours.

25:05.467 --> 25:06.866
Wait, what? Oh, sorry.

25:06.902 --> 25:10.811
You lost me when you said
no fuckin' whiskey.

25:12.974 --> 25:15.257
I hear you wanna kill me.

25:15.643 --> 25:18.543
You're gonna sit down
and watch me drink this whiskey

25:18.579 --> 25:20.779
until the bottle's empty.

25:20.815 --> 25:22.693
Then you die.

25:22.917 --> 25:25.083
That's my girl.

25:36.696 --> 25:38.630
My dear, if I was going to poison you,

25:38.665 --> 25:41.499
I wouldn't waste it with good whiskey.

25:43.569 --> 25:45.169
Ah!

25:45.204 --> 25:47.738
I have to say, when I recruited you,

25:47.773 --> 25:51.642
I had no idea you'd be this good.

25:51.677 --> 25:54.645
So disappointed to see that

25:54.680 --> 25:57.213
my hand-picked battle bitch

25:57.249 --> 25:59.082
has gone all domestic.

25:59.118 --> 26:00.984
You didn't recruit me.

26:01.020 --> 26:02.918
You manipulated and lied to me.

26:02.954 --> 26:05.888
Potatoes, potahtos.

26:05.923 --> 26:08.557
You really think this is gonna
end well for you, huh?

26:08.584 --> 26:10.277
It always has.

26:11.896 --> 26:15.264
Did I ever tell you how
I started the Blood Drive?

26:15.299 --> 26:16.565
It's a funny story.

26:16.600 --> 26:20.568
Well, not funny-funny, but funny.

26:20.603 --> 26:23.571
You don't know who I really am, do you?

26:23.606 --> 26:25.907
You mean, besides a sexless monster,

26:25.942 --> 26:29.044
created from dirty jizz
and a broken egg?

26:29.079 --> 26:31.746
I'm built for this life.

26:31.782 --> 26:34.248
Literally, you can't best me, Grace.

26:34.284 --> 26:35.917
I'm always a step ahead.

26:35.952 --> 26:37.284
Yeah, I've heard this speech before.

26:37.319 --> 26:39.553
You should've listened.

26:41.891 --> 26:44.024
You can try and kill me if you like.

26:44.060 --> 26:47.961
Fine by me.

26:47.997 --> 26:52.866
But look around you, little Missy.

26:52.902 --> 26:56.235
This here's a showdown.

26:56.270 --> 26:59.205
Who's gonna draw first?

27:11.785 --> 27:13.752
Cheers.

27:18.625 --> 27:20.926
Aah!

27:35.975 --> 27:37.641
You know, for this to be a fair fight,

27:37.676 --> 27:40.010
I really should...

27:40.046 --> 27:43.147
put one hand behind my back.

27:52.390 --> 27:56.826
Or stapled to the table, as it were.

27:56.862 --> 28:00.296
Right on cue.

28:00.331 --> 28:01.364
I need your help.

28:01.399 --> 28:02.865
Of course you do.

28:02.900 --> 28:05.801
I'm a little busy here, Arthur.

28:05.836 --> 28:08.703
I'm not sure the Sheriff
is playing us card up.

28:08.739 --> 28:11.106
Yeah, he's probably not.

28:11.142 --> 28:14.810
- No one is.
- Hear, hear.

28:14.845 --> 28:19.113
It's feeling like a two man job.

28:19.149 --> 28:21.615
I can't help you, Barbie.

28:21.651 --> 28:26.154
You see, Slink and I have
some unfinished business.

28:26.189 --> 28:30.324
Saddle up, boys! Let's ride out!

28:30.359 --> 28:32.794
He really is a handsome devil, isn't he?

28:32.829 --> 28:34.162
Mm.

28:34.197 --> 28:36.196
Are you really gonna let Chiseled Chin

28:36.231 --> 28:39.966
lead you off to a new mission?

28:40.002 --> 28:42.202
I would rather kill you 100 times

28:42.237 --> 28:45.205
than do anything else.

28:51.180 --> 28:54.413
A parlor trick.

28:54.448 --> 28:57.149
This here...

28:57.185 --> 28:58.984
this here's the real magic.

29:03.024 --> 29:04.990
Let's play a little game.

29:05.026 --> 29:08.327
20 questions for 20 punches.

29:08.362 --> 29:11.996
Question one:

29:12.032 --> 29:14.165
Where'd you and Karma grow up?

29:14.201 --> 29:15.867
Kansas.

29:18.371 --> 29:21.739
It's on the license plate, you dipshit.

29:21.774 --> 29:25.844
Speaking of which,
where did you get the Camaro?

29:25.879 --> 29:28.345
My dad.

29:28.380 --> 29:31.849
What else you got?

29:31.884 --> 29:35.018
How did your parents die?

29:43.395 --> 29:45.427
You didn't answer that one.

29:45.463 --> 29:47.730
Didn't have to.

29:47.765 --> 29:49.165
Okay, then.

29:51.069 --> 29:53.870
Looks like we might be here
for a little while.

30:01.245 --> 30:06.882
Wow, your life reads like one
long, depressing country song.

30:06.917 --> 30:08.884
Now you're gonna answer
one of my questions.

30:08.919 --> 30:13.388
- Oh.
- Why are you so obsessed

30:13.423 --> 30:14.990
with me and my sister?

30:15.025 --> 30:17.158
Heart Enterprises,

30:17.194 --> 30:19.393
they... they round off the edges.

30:19.428 --> 30:21.428
And then they complain
it's not edgy enough.

30:21.463 --> 30:25.099
And all their terrible notes,
you keep popping up.

30:25.134 --> 30:26.400
"Make her get naked more."

30:26.435 --> 30:28.102
"We need more boobies,
boobies, boobies!"

30:28.137 --> 30:30.237
"Why does she always have to
wear those stupid tool belts?"

30:30.273 --> 30:32.106
"Does she have to race with that cop?"

30:32.141 --> 30:35.841
In other words, you don't know.

30:35.877 --> 30:37.944
They're ruining my show.

30:37.979 --> 30:41.414
Maybe I should've just asked
one of the executives.

30:41.449 --> 30:45.018
That's where all the real power is.

30:45.053 --> 30:47.853
Because I don't think
you have control at all.

30:47.889 --> 30:50.189
You're just a freak
who wears too much makeup

30:50.225 --> 30:52.424
and thinks he's an artist.

30:57.531 --> 30:58.931
Hm.

31:07.975 --> 31:09.206
Aah!

31:14.513 --> 31:18.115
What the hell are you?

31:18.151 --> 31:21.953
I'm fuckin' fabulous.

31:21.988 --> 31:23.887
Hey, Grace, you need any help?

31:23.923 --> 31:26.957
- No.
- Well I do... bad.

31:26.992 --> 31:30.560
Officer Bailey, will you very
kindly fuck off!

31:30.595 --> 31:32.329
Look, this town isn't so great.

31:32.364 --> 31:34.998
The Sheriff is a sociopath
and I just helped him

31:35.033 --> 31:37.167
grab up a bunch of innocent
people whose only crime

31:37.202 --> 31:38.468
was trying to be free.

31:38.503 --> 31:40.070
No can do, Barbie.

31:40.105 --> 31:41.304
You're on your own.

31:41.340 --> 31:43.305
He's gonna kill a kid, Grace.

31:43.341 --> 31:45.574
Please. What if this was Karma?

31:45.609 --> 31:48.377
Karma's dead. Okay?

31:48.412 --> 31:51.480
So you go fight your own demons.

31:51.515 --> 31:53.315
I'll fight mine.

31:55.286 --> 31:57.186
I...

31:57.221 --> 31:59.521
Is that what I am to you, now?

31:59.556 --> 32:01.089
A demon?

32:01.124 --> 32:04.625
Looks like someone at Heart
has a hard on for me.

32:04.660 --> 32:06.961
I know nothing about it.

32:06.997 --> 32:09.864
But you probably shouldn't mess
with their favorite racer.

32:09.899 --> 32:11.532
You, on the other hand,

32:11.567 --> 32:14.268
they probably want dead.

32:14.304 --> 32:17.437
So how about we give the fans
what they want?

32:19.975 --> 32:24.944
Have you wondered why
I sent you here to Red River?

32:24.980 --> 32:27.280
A place where there's no electricity?

32:27.316 --> 32:28.548
'Cause you're an idiot.

32:28.583 --> 32:31.151
No electricity means no brain bombs.

32:32.621 --> 32:35.388
Ah, but neither are there any cameras.

32:35.423 --> 32:38.391
No one to watch.

32:38.426 --> 32:41.060
You brought us here
'cause you wanna kill me.

32:44.098 --> 32:45.964
So Heart wants me alive

32:46.000 --> 32:49.235
and you want me dead?

32:51.005 --> 32:53.505
Call it an executive decision.

32:53.540 --> 32:55.173
Ratings.

32:55.208 --> 32:57.575
Live plus seven, live plus three.

32:57.610 --> 33:00.578
What does that even mean?

33:02.715 --> 33:06.684
You are a stain

33:06.719 --> 33:08.352
on my masterpiece.

33:08.387 --> 33:10.320
My God, you're a piece of shit.

33:10.356 --> 33:13.090
Grace! Now would be the time!

33:13.125 --> 33:15.125
Don't be cliché.

33:20.966 --> 33:24.101
My hat! This is vintage!

33:29.474 --> 33:31.174
I told you.

33:31.209 --> 33:33.443
You can't hurt me.
You certainly can't kill me.

33:33.478 --> 33:35.635
I wasn't trying to kill you.

33:36.581 --> 33:38.548
Needed this.

33:47.663 --> 33:50.226
It won't work.

33:50.978 --> 33:53.142
I have to try.

33:53.414 --> 33:56.884
You think you're the first
innocent man in this jail?

33:57.417 --> 34:00.952
You deserve it, though, after
what you did to me and mine.

34:00.987 --> 34:03.221
He tricked me.

34:03.256 --> 34:04.889
He said you were evil.

34:04.924 --> 34:07.892
And you believed him.

34:07.927 --> 34:10.295
Oh, you got the evil part right.

34:10.330 --> 34:13.360
You just blamed the wrong person.

34:14.260 --> 34:17.161
He sell you the story
about The Scar changing people?

34:17.197 --> 34:20.164
- Yeah.
- Well, it's true.

34:20.199 --> 34:21.998
Only he was the one that changed.

34:22.034 --> 34:23.568
Stopped trusting anyone.

34:23.603 --> 34:26.170
Killed anyone who disagreed with him.

34:26.206 --> 34:28.038
- Even his own deputies.
- That's why people

34:28.074 --> 34:30.005
are so focused on their jobs here.

34:30.041 --> 34:31.507
Because if you don't
do it to perfection,

34:31.543 --> 34:33.076
you're gonna pay with your life.

34:33.110 --> 34:35.078
No one pushed back?

34:35.112 --> 34:37.045
We did.

34:41.253 --> 34:44.353
What happened?

34:44.389 --> 34:47.356
Our family got a lot smaller.

34:47.391 --> 34:48.690
Oh, Christ.

34:51.728 --> 34:53.696
I'm so sorry.

34:55.966 --> 34:57.600
We make a great team.

34:57.635 --> 34:59.568
We're like two pieces
of the same puzzle.

34:59.604 --> 35:01.604
That sounded corny.

35:01.639 --> 35:04.205
- Stupid Terry! Stupid.
- Stop it.

35:04.241 --> 35:05.640
Don't say that.

35:05.675 --> 35:09.544
You're not stupid, all right?

35:09.579 --> 35:12.447
I-I actually think you're beautiful.

35:15.985 --> 35:18.119
I am?

35:21.323 --> 35:25.959
There's nothing else left to repair.

35:25.994 --> 35:29.730
Except... us.

35:44.178 --> 35:47.480
Wow. That was one hell of a day.

35:49.784 --> 35:53.518
Something's different.

35:53.553 --> 35:55.587
Your eyes.

35:55.622 --> 35:58.657
They're...

35:58.692 --> 36:01.025
human.

36:03.530 --> 36:05.764
You've never done that before.

36:05.799 --> 36:08.767
- What?
- Covered yourself.

36:08.802 --> 36:12.536
What are you feeling?

36:12.571 --> 36:16.173
Shame.

36:16.208 --> 36:18.175
That's good.

36:18.210 --> 36:20.177
Why is that good?

36:20.212 --> 36:23.681
You're becoming human.

36:23.716 --> 36:27.350
You're right.

36:27.385 --> 36:29.686
I feel.

36:29.721 --> 36:33.122
I actually feel.

36:33.157 --> 36:35.658
Our connection caused
a kernel boot error.

36:35.694 --> 36:38.027
A severe stack overflow.

36:38.062 --> 36:40.029
What does that even mean?

36:43.568 --> 36:47.068
It means I love you, Christopher.

36:49.406 --> 36:52.741
I love you too, Aki.

36:52.776 --> 36:54.743
What do we do now?

36:58.782 --> 37:01.716
We get the hell out of this city.

37:05.888 --> 37:08.856
- You don't have to do this.
- Yes, I do.

37:08.891 --> 37:11.859
Order must be maintained.

37:11.894 --> 37:14.528
People don't have to die
to maintain order.

37:14.564 --> 37:16.096
That's why we have laws.

37:16.131 --> 37:18.398
That's what got us into this mess.

37:18.433 --> 37:21.434
There were laws about fracking,
weren't there?

37:21.470 --> 37:24.771
Laws don't mean shit when you
don't enforce them with blood.

37:24.806 --> 37:27.374
- Grab the boy first.
- No!

37:32.781 --> 37:35.514
Who do you think you are?
You're gonna die first.

37:35.549 --> 37:37.516
I can't stand the sight of you.

37:54.834 --> 37:56.949
No.

37:57.270 --> 38:00.567
I want the last thing he sees
to be my face.

38:03.142 --> 38:05.410
She can't save you now.

38:07.914 --> 38:10.716
Nothing can save you now.

38:10.916 --> 38:12.630
Grace!

38:12.918 --> 38:14.418
Now would be the time!

38:17.282 --> 38:20.438
I want the last thing he sees
to be my face.

38:22.487 --> 38:24.454
She can't save you now.

38:27.728 --> 38:30.298
Nothing can save you now.

38:30.562 --> 38:32.428
Grace!

38:32.743 --> 38:34.197
Now would be the time!

38:34.437 --> 38:38.200
Okay, hangman. Do your job.

38:42.005 --> 38:44.537
I'm sorry.

38:44.908 --> 38:47.396
I was just trying to do the right thing.

39:36.407 --> 39:38.047
You son of a bitch.

39:38.102 --> 39:39.538
You killed children.

39:39.563 --> 39:42.157
There ain't no law without blood.

39:42.639 --> 39:44.772
You don't see that yet, but you will.

39:44.797 --> 39:46.289
Shut your mouth.

39:46.343 --> 39:48.376
You don't know me.

39:48.475 --> 39:54.504
I know why you carry that God
damn diary around, Arthur Bailey.

39:57.652 --> 39:59.885
I saw what you did to get it.

39:59.920 --> 40:01.101
How do you know that?

40:01.126 --> 40:04.585
And it ain't nothing compared
to what you're gonna do.

40:04.610 --> 40:07.744
That's what The Scar did to me, kid.

40:07.927 --> 40:09.688
It helped me see.

40:09.996 --> 40:12.571
And I see...

40:13.079 --> 40:14.545
you.

40:21.587 --> 40:23.750
Arthur.

40:28.219 --> 40:30.587
Oh, shit. You're hurt

40:35.154 --> 40:36.987
Arthur. Arthur.

40:42.026 --> 40:45.629
Okay, Terry says there's
a doctor in the next town.

40:45.742 --> 40:47.875
You're gonna be okay.

40:51.736 --> 40:53.135
I gotta go.

40:53.171 --> 40:55.136
You sure you're gonna be happy here?

40:55.172 --> 40:56.938
You saved my life.

40:56.973 --> 40:58.994
When were you in danger?

40:59.291 --> 41:00.908
I'm not talking about that.

41:00.962 --> 41:03.000
Besides...

41:04.436 --> 41:06.686
this town needs a new sheriff.

41:07.174 --> 41:09.341
Good luck, you two.

41:14.556 --> 41:15.780
Huh.

41:15.866 --> 41:18.826
You can take one hell of a licking,
but you still bleed.

41:18.861 --> 41:20.943
Have the guts to put on that same show

41:20.968 --> 41:23.046
when the cameras are running?

41:23.398 --> 41:25.465
Yeah. I thought so.

41:27.783 --> 41:29.649
You don't really think

41:29.684 --> 41:32.374
you're gonna live
happily ever after, do you?

41:32.573 --> 41:36.743
He shot that sheriff in cold blood.

41:36.778 --> 41:38.624
Even you saw it.

41:38.747 --> 41:41.249
Or did that just make you wet?

41:41.582 --> 41:44.764
Your petty bullshit
isn't gonna work on me anymore.

41:44.853 --> 41:47.819
Follow us, and we'll find
a way to kill you.

42:00.234 --> 42:02.907
Left you live, right you die.

42:03.035 --> 42:05.665
Left you live, right you die.

42:05.756 --> 42:08.063
Left you live, right...
