WEBVTT

00:02.600 --> 00:03.483
Fauzi, it's Barry.

00:04.123 --> 00:05.286
I'm coming for my nephew's wedding.

00:05.350 --> 00:06.440
Dad doesn't want to go either.

00:06.541 --> 00:08.150
Why do you think he hasn't been
back in 20 years?

00:10.495 --> 00:12.608
They're not my family.
You're my family.

00:12.742 --> 00:13.859
Bassam.

00:13.992 --> 00:14.859
Father.

00:15.027 --> 00:16.694
He's changed, Bassam.

00:16.861 --> 00:18.161
Little brother.

00:18.925 --> 00:20.062
Jamal.

00:20.675 --> 00:22.655
People are always
spreading rumors about Ihab.

00:22.763 --> 00:27.152
So he has no plans to
blow up my son's wedding?

00:27.201 --> 00:28.214
Bassam.

00:28.264 --> 00:29.288
It's your father.

00:29.338 --> 00:31.171
It should have been you.

00:32.356 --> 00:33.414
He's gone.

00:34.412 --> 00:36.070
Now you are in charge.

00:36.540 --> 00:38.902
Aah. Jamal.

00:38.952 --> 00:39.811
We're going home.

00:39.860 --> 00:41.770
We're not even
staying for Grandpa's funeral?

00:44.517 --> 00:45.462
That's good.

00:45.511 --> 00:46.512
What is this?

00:46.831 --> 00:47.909
Aah!

00:49.296 --> 00:50.394
Mr. Al Fayeed?

00:53.467 --> 00:55.080
I told you we
shouldn't have come.

01:07.185 --> 01:09.152
Yes I've got them.

01:09.201 --> 01:10.813
We'll be there soon.

01:10.930 --> 01:14.066
Yes, I will.

01:14.183 --> 01:18.686
Yes, we are taking Bassam
to the hospital.

01:18.821 --> 01:21.906
Right.

01:22.023 --> 01:24.574
Sammy?

01:27.778 --> 01:29.912
I'm sorry.

01:34.251 --> 01:35.868
Yes.

01:36.003 --> 01:37.536
I'm sure he is.

01:37.670 --> 01:38.703
Yes, I will.

01:38.871 --> 01:41.006
Okay.

01:44.626 --> 01:46.960
Bassam, I just got confirmation.

01:47.095 --> 01:49.847
Jamal's accident wasn't
an accident.

01:49.964 --> 01:51.598
It was an attempt on his life.

01:51.716 --> 01:54.718
Wait. Someone tried
to kill Uncle Jamal?

01:54.852 --> 01:56.636
I'm afraid so.

02:04.192 --> 02:06.060
What did he do to make
her so angry?

02:06.228 --> 02:06.894
Look at this.

02:07.029 --> 02:10.698
She bit right through the pudendal vein
and the circumflex artery.

02:10.816 --> 02:13.984
Ouch.

02:14.118 --> 02:15.902
Leila.

02:19.205 --> 02:21.907
The woman who did this
to my husband... who was she?

02:22.075 --> 02:24.076
A follower of Ihab Rashid.

02:24.209 --> 02:26.160
I doubt
she was working alone, General.

02:26.378 --> 02:29.464
I've already arrested
dozens of Ihab's followers.

02:29.581 --> 02:31.999
Put up checkpoints, imposed a curfew.

02:32.133 --> 02:34.167
I'm ready to impose a complete blockade.

02:34.385 --> 02:36.136
No one gets in or out of Ma'an.

02:36.254 --> 02:37.137
No food, no supplies.

02:37.255 --> 02:39.423
There will be pushback.

02:39.589 --> 02:40.639
From amnesty, the U.N.

02:40.757 --> 02:41.674
Would you rather I wait

02:41.808 --> 02:45.177
for your husband to get
out of surgery?

02:45.311 --> 02:48.730
Just find Ihab Rashid.

02:50.266 --> 02:52.484
Step over here.

02:52.601 --> 02:54.069
Your paperwork?

02:54.185 --> 02:55.185
I have to look inside.

02:55.320 --> 02:56.103
No.

02:56.237 --> 02:56.937
Come on, come on.

02:57.105 --> 02:57.771
Hands on the car.

02:57.906 --> 02:59.573
It's like this every day.

02:59.691 --> 03:00.524
What did he do?

03:00.657 --> 03:02.492
Identification.

03:17.339 --> 03:20.207
Curfew's at sundown.

03:50.066 --> 03:50.950
Mohammed.

03:51.067 --> 03:51.951
Ihab.

03:52.152 --> 03:53.619
Ah, thank god you're all right.

03:53.736 --> 03:54.986
Yes, thank him.

03:55.155 --> 03:56.155
And I thank him for sending us

03:56.288 --> 03:59.073
Samira.

03:59.207 --> 04:00.874
Where is Kamal?

04:01.076 --> 04:04.546
They arrested him.

04:04.662 --> 04:05.913
But we cleared out his warehouse

04:06.047 --> 04:07.581
before the soldiers got there.

04:07.714 --> 04:09.632
My uncle has
arranged a safe house for us.

04:09.750 --> 04:10.633
Come on! Come.

04:16.140 --> 04:19.509
It's my father.

04:21.060 --> 04:22.561
Father?

04:22.677 --> 04:24.512
Where are you?

04:24.646 --> 04:26.180
I've been calling you.

04:26.348 --> 04:27.231
I'm just buying food

04:27.349 --> 04:29.183
in case things get worse.

04:29.401 --> 04:31.902
Samira, you shouldn't
be on the streets.

04:32.019 --> 04:36.689
Soldiers just killed
three people in Filan.

04:36.824 --> 04:38.024
I'll be home soon.

04:38.191 --> 04:39.024
Ma'a salama.

04:39.191 --> 04:39.991
Hurry.

04:40.109 --> 04:40.943
I will, I will.

04:41.076 --> 04:41.993
Samira?

04:49.283 --> 04:50.700
I have a bad feeling.

04:50.835 --> 04:51.701
It's-it's the wrong time.

04:51.836 --> 04:52.702
You're not ready.

04:52.870 --> 04:54.788
Ihab?

04:54.921 --> 04:59.258
General Tariq will kill you.

04:59.376 --> 05:00.709
Samira, go home.

05:00.844 --> 05:02.711
Okay? Go home.

05:02.846 --> 05:03.879
Your father needs you.

05:04.046 --> 05:07.465
You've been helpful enough
already. Go.

05:10.218 --> 05:12.052
Go home.

05:25.231 --> 05:27.315
Uh, just put them
anywhere. Thanks.

05:27.450 --> 05:29.317
Uh, are we really
staying here this time?

05:29.452 --> 05:31.319
'Cause I was kind of getting
used to that hotel.

05:31.453 --> 05:33.320
That might be difficult.

05:33.455 --> 05:34.321
There are security concerns.

05:34.539 --> 05:35.739
Uh, no. He's kidding.

05:35.907 --> 05:37.041
Adolescent irony can get lost

05:37.158 --> 05:38.242
in translation.

05:38.409 --> 05:39.576
Ah!

05:39.744 --> 05:41.745
So, how long are we
staying here this time?

05:41.878 --> 05:43.611
At least until
your grandfather's funeral.

05:43.763 --> 05:44.450
In the meantime,

05:44.625 --> 05:47.883
if you're looking for something to
do, we have many activities.

05:48.001 --> 05:49.801
There is a gym and a spa,

05:49.918 --> 05:51.085
putting green, bowling alley,

05:51.221 --> 05:52.087
a skeet shooting range...

05:52.221 --> 05:53.921
Skeet shooting?

05:54.139 --> 05:56.641
Your grandfather was
an excellent shot.

05:57.758 --> 05:58.642
It's your dad.

05:58.760 --> 05:59.644
Excuse me.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.595
He once scored a perfect...

06:01.729 --> 06:02.762
Hey. How's Jamal?

06:02.896 --> 06:05.147
Uh, he went into
surgery just before I got here.

06:05.265 --> 06:08.601
But, uh, I think they're expecting him
to make a full recovery.

06:08.768 --> 06:10.236
Good.

06:10.352 --> 06:12.270
How are you doing?

06:12.438 --> 06:16.107
Uh, I'm, uh, I'm okay.

06:16.275 --> 06:17.775
I guess.

06:17.942 --> 06:21.862
Listen, can you, uh, can you go
online and rebook our flights?

06:21.996 --> 06:22.946
The funeral's tomorrow...

06:23.114 --> 06:24.281
Come on, stop, stop.

06:24.449 --> 06:25.332
Anytime you want a seat on a plane,

06:25.450 --> 06:27.164
someone will get you a seat on a plane.

06:27.268 --> 06:30.621
They'll get you the whole damn
plane if you want one.

06:32.339 --> 06:33.423
Yeah, sure.

06:33.540 --> 06:34.706
I'm just in the habit of...

06:34.842 --> 06:36.176
Barry...

06:36.292 --> 06:38.377
I know you don't want to be here.

06:38.511 --> 06:39.595
I get that.

06:39.711 --> 06:43.047
Honey, I just want to understand why.

06:47.602 --> 06:51.138
My father asked me to stay.

06:51.305 --> 06:54.808
In the hospital just before he died.

06:54.941 --> 06:57.610
He was... he was asking me to

06:57.727 --> 06:59.812
come back here and help Jamal.

07:01.947 --> 07:03.565
Help him do what?

07:05.483 --> 07:06.650
I don't know.

07:06.819 --> 07:10.155
Help him... help him start
running the country or, uh...

07:10.288 --> 07:11.655
I don't know.

07:11.790 --> 07:13.157
It's crazy, it's...

07:13.290 --> 07:15.158
Honey.

07:17.661 --> 07:19.495
Your father's not here anymore.

07:19.663 --> 07:20.880
You don't need to keep running

07:20.997 --> 07:24.666
like the doors are slamming
closed on you.

07:24.801 --> 07:28.503
You don't know this place,
Mol, it's...

07:28.670 --> 07:30.805
it's not like back home.

07:33.058 --> 07:36.393
Listen, um, can we talk about
this later?

07:36.510 --> 07:39.512
Barry...

07:44.317 --> 07:47.820
Don't you want to be
here for my father?

07:47.936 --> 07:50.354
Hmm?

07:51.023 --> 07:52.273
I'm just tired, okay?

07:52.407 --> 07:53.324
That's all.

07:53.441 --> 07:54.692
I want to go home.

07:59.163 --> 08:03.700
Nusrat's going back
to the palace.

08:03.834 --> 08:05.368
You should take her.

08:05.501 --> 08:09.121
Your father will be in surgery
for the rest of the day.

08:14.876 --> 08:18.713
I want to be here
when he wakes up.

08:18.879 --> 08:20.714
You're a good son.

08:20.931 --> 08:23.016
And you'll make a good husband.

08:27.887 --> 08:29.054
Take Nusrat to her car.

08:29.188 --> 08:30.221
I'll be here.

08:30.390 --> 08:32.191
Go.

08:36.894 --> 08:38.812
Uncle.

08:38.946 --> 08:39.980
Ahmed.

08:40.114 --> 08:42.282
I'm around if you need me.

08:42.399 --> 08:44.734
Thanks.

08:48.455 --> 08:51.907
Duty nurse said
he'd just gone into surgery.

08:52.418 --> 08:54.935
Yussef was kind of vague about his injuries,

08:54.985 --> 08:59.497
but he said there
was a woman in the car with him.

09:01.160 --> 09:03.384
Jamal can tell you himself.

09:03.500 --> 09:07.086
Before he went under,
he kept asking to see you.

09:08.113 --> 09:11.808
I didn't tell him you tried
to run again.

09:11.925 --> 09:13.926
You know that it's
hard for me to be here.

09:14.093 --> 09:16.762
Clearly.

09:16.895 --> 09:21.098
Maybe someday we can be honest
with each other about why.

09:21.233 --> 09:23.984
Bassam, no.

09:24.102 --> 09:25.069
Leila!

09:25.187 --> 09:27.104
Where are you going?

09:29.323 --> 09:31.491
How did you find this place?

09:31.609 --> 09:33.777
My father.

09:33.910 --> 09:37.446
He said it's where the crusaders
hid from Saladin.

09:42.084 --> 09:47.171
Okay, so they don't
have this in America.

09:47.371 --> 09:48.455
You don't get this...

09:48.589 --> 09:49.539
in America.

09:49.674 --> 09:50.957
What are you...?

09:51.091 --> 09:53.125
I don't want you to go.

09:53.293 --> 09:55.961
Please, don't go.

09:56.129 --> 09:56.962
Don't go.

09:57.130 --> 09:58.180
Leila...

09:58.298 --> 09:59.432
I know, Bassam.

09:59.549 --> 10:01.884
Shut up. I know.

10:11.526 --> 10:15.229
At least you have a reason
to come back.

10:15.363 --> 10:17.281
20 years, Bassam.

10:17.396 --> 10:22.033
20 years, and you're still
running away.

10:22.151 --> 10:23.618
That's my home.

10:23.736 --> 10:25.871
That's my life now.

10:25.988 --> 10:28.457
Right.

10:28.574 --> 10:32.794
Treating overprivileged
children with ear infections.

10:36.214 --> 10:37.331
Excuse me.

10:37.498 --> 10:40.967
Molly wants me to call her
about Jamal.

10:46.255 --> 10:48.139
Sorry if I was a jerk before.

10:48.257 --> 10:50.174
No, you weren't a jerk.

10:50.309 --> 10:51.175
I was.

10:51.310 --> 10:53.895
We weren't expecting
to spend our honeymoon this way.

10:54.095 --> 10:55.262
Your mother's right.

10:55.396 --> 10:56.346
You know what?

10:56.514 --> 10:58.348
You're a good husband.

11:05.105 --> 11:07.239
Nusrat?

11:15.247 --> 11:16.865
Leave it!

11:16.998 --> 11:18.365
Get out.

11:18.533 --> 11:19.249
Hurry!

11:19.367 --> 11:20.117
Can't!

11:20.250 --> 11:21.200
It's stuck!

11:26.089 --> 11:28.291
Fahmy, look.

11:28.509 --> 11:29.458
Where are you going?!

11:29.593 --> 11:30.510
Get back here!

11:30.626 --> 11:31.376
Forget it.

11:31.511 --> 11:32.210
Let's just go.

11:32.378 --> 11:33.295
Let's get out of here.

11:33.428 --> 11:34.879
We'll never get her out in time.

11:37.265 --> 11:38.349
They're coming.

11:38.466 --> 11:40.267
Shit.

13:03.654 --> 13:05.067
Pull!

13:07.403 --> 13:10.655
I suck at this.

13:10.789 --> 13:12.040
Who's that?

13:12.157 --> 13:13.074
Abdul.

13:13.208 --> 13:14.125
Salaam alaikum.

13:14.242 --> 13:15.492
Uh, walla something.

13:15.660 --> 13:17.210
Wa alaikum as-salaam.

13:17.328 --> 13:19.663
Right. That thing.

13:19.830 --> 13:21.213
Hi.

13:21.332 --> 13:22.633
Hello.

13:22.833 --> 13:24.500
Abdul, this is my sister, Emma.

13:24.668 --> 13:25.918
Hey.

13:26.571 --> 13:28.642
Please, um, accept my condolences.

13:28.754 --> 13:29.921
Your grandfather was a great man.

13:30.056 --> 13:32.007
And a great marksman.

13:32.750 --> 13:34.192
So we've heard.

13:34.500 --> 13:35.506
That's why we're here.

13:35.555 --> 13:37.503
To... remember him.

13:37.561 --> 13:38.645
We're on his team.

13:38.762 --> 13:40.289
Yeah, we didn't know
him very well.

13:40.348 --> 13:43.183
Actually, we didn't know him
at all, so it's all pretty weird.

13:46.652 --> 13:47.685
Sorry.

13:47.854 --> 13:49.905
My friend in the States keeps
harassing me.

13:50.023 --> 13:52.608
McKenna, you'll never believe

13:52.741 --> 13:54.526
what I'm doing right now.

13:54.659 --> 13:58.078
She seems, uh...
nice, your sister.

13:58.196 --> 14:01.615
She's okay.

14:02.542 --> 14:04.724
So, we're leaving after the funeral,

14:04.774 --> 14:09.705
and I thought maybe we
could hang out before I go.

14:09.839 --> 14:13.508
I'd be disappointed
if we didn't.

14:15.794 --> 14:19.046
This is in our territory,
do you understand that?

14:19.214 --> 14:20.764
Leila, trust me.

14:20.881 --> 14:21.965
I don't need this now.

14:22.184 --> 14:24.885
Something happen with Jamal?

14:25.602 --> 14:27.603
Nusrat's car has been ambushed.

14:27.721 --> 14:28.604
They're holding her hostage.

14:28.721 --> 14:29.604
Who is?

14:29.723 --> 14:31.607
Ihab Rashid's terrorists.

14:31.724 --> 14:33.608
Well, what do they want?

14:33.726 --> 14:35.310
They must have demands.

14:35.444 --> 14:36.778
We don't negotiate
with terrorists.

14:36.857 --> 14:37.957
Do you even know what they want?

14:38.007 --> 14:38.889
Ahmed.

14:40.899 --> 14:43.151
Let the General do his job.

14:43.285 --> 14:44.986
Sir.

14:45.120 --> 14:46.621
We have to leave.

14:46.737 --> 14:48.905
I'm coming with you.

14:49.073 --> 14:53.126
I don't need my mother's permission.

15:04.906 --> 15:07.889
Call me when Jamal's out of surgery.

15:08.807 --> 15:10.592
I'll be at the palace.

15:36.164 --> 15:37.831
Let me go,

15:37.949 --> 15:42.314
and I will do everything I can
to make sure you're treated fairly.

15:42.362 --> 15:44.870
Keep her quiet.

15:45.505 --> 15:46.789
Please.

15:46.956 --> 15:48.423
You're making a mistake.

15:48.541 --> 15:50.709
I said shut her up!

15:50.843 --> 15:53.128
Shh.

15:53.295 --> 15:56.431
We should have run when
everyone else did.

15:56.548 --> 15:59.099
When we had the chance.

15:59.217 --> 16:01.101
And let my brother rot in prison?

16:01.302 --> 16:03.771
He'll rot there anyway,
and we'll be dead.

16:03.887 --> 16:05.138
Look.

16:05.304 --> 16:09.057
We're all going to die
because of you.

16:09.275 --> 16:12.611
Then we'll die.

16:12.729 --> 16:14.529
And so will she.

16:24.655 --> 16:26.623
You're back.

16:26.740 --> 16:30.242
Yeah, Jamal will be
in, uh, surgery most of the day.

16:30.376 --> 16:33.328
But, um... Nusrat is...

16:33.496 --> 16:34.546
John told me.

16:34.663 --> 16:35.546
It's awful.

16:35.664 --> 16:37.548
What do you know about
what's going on?

16:37.666 --> 16:39.751
It's what I know
about the players.

16:39.884 --> 16:41.991
With your father gone,
Jamal out of commission,

16:42.041 --> 16:44.638
Tariq's gonna do what Tariq does:
go in hard.

16:44.756 --> 16:47.557
He doesn't have any incentive to
resolve this peacefully.

16:47.674 --> 16:51.177
But he wouldn't risk Nusrat's life.

16:51.344 --> 16:54.263
For Tariq, it's not even
"consequences be damned."

16:54.397 --> 16:58.150
The consequences give him political cover
that he's been looking for.

16:58.267 --> 16:59.150
Cover to do what?

16:59.268 --> 17:00.485
Impose martial law.

17:00.602 --> 17:02.186
That's Tariq's playbook.

17:02.353 --> 17:05.473
So, these "terrorists"

17:05.550 --> 17:09.777
holding Nusrat, they're just a bunch of
kids in over their heads.

17:09.910 --> 17:12.361
Can you, uh...
can you talk to him?

17:12.529 --> 17:14.363
Oh, he wouldn't listen to me.

17:14.531 --> 17:17.250
And I represent the U.S. government.

17:17.367 --> 17:19.702
Now, he might listen to you.

17:22.872 --> 17:24.756
Me?

17:24.957 --> 17:26.708
You're an Al Fayeed.

17:29.877 --> 17:32.595
I have no standing here.

17:32.797 --> 17:34.597
You're Khaled's son.

17:34.714 --> 17:35.798
You're Jamal's brother.

17:35.933 --> 17:37.801
Blood is everything in this place.

17:37.935 --> 17:41.137
You don't need me to tell you that.

17:44.389 --> 17:46.224
You could try.

17:46.391 --> 17:49.443
John just wants you to talk to him.

17:49.561 --> 17:55.283
Listen, if it's not something
that you're comfortable doing...

17:55.398 --> 17:57.733
Uh, I'm not.

17:57.901 --> 17:59.235
I get it.

17:59.369 --> 18:01.487
Just a thought.

18:24.807 --> 18:26.474
Well...

18:26.592 --> 18:29.928
S-so how long will you be staying, Ihab?

18:30.061 --> 18:31.762
Don't worry, uncle.

18:31.930 --> 18:33.397
We won't abuse your hospitality.

18:34.304 --> 18:35.150
No, no, no.

18:35.200 --> 18:38.185
It's just... when you asked for
a place to stay, you never

18:38.320 --> 18:41.199
mentioned anything about storing
weapons, and...

18:41.324 --> 18:44.657
if trucks are seen coming and going,
it could arouse suspicion, you know?

18:44.775 --> 18:46.276
Ah. Uncle.

18:46.443 --> 18:47.944
Ah, Ihab! Ihab!

18:48.077 --> 18:49.328
Ah! Ah!

18:49.445 --> 18:52.781
You have filled your pockets
collaborating with the Al Fayeeds.

18:52.915 --> 18:56.701
The only reason I have tolerated you
is because you're my father's brother.

18:56.835 --> 18:57.919
Ihab!

18:58.036 --> 19:03.124
Uncle, the time for playing both sides
is coming to an end.

19:03.291 --> 19:05.759
It pains me to hear
you make such accusations

19:05.876 --> 19:08.377
when my only concern
is for your safety, Ihab.

19:08.511 --> 19:09.378
Ihab.

19:09.511 --> 19:10.595
Huh.

19:10.714 --> 19:13.933
Kamal's brother
Fahmy ambushed a government car.

19:14.049 --> 19:15.466
Fahmy?

19:15.634 --> 19:17.769
He's a child.

19:17.887 --> 19:20.355
He's taken a hostage.

19:20.472 --> 19:22.307
Nusrat Al Fayeed.

19:22.473 --> 19:25.275
And General Tariq is there.

19:31.315 --> 19:33.399
I came to look for you, but...

19:33.533 --> 19:36.903
John Tucker told me
you refused to approach Tariq.

19:37.036 --> 19:39.487
Was it Tucker asking me or was it you?

19:39.705 --> 19:41.489
Well, what difference does it make?

19:41.539 --> 19:43.992
The situation is the situation.

19:44.913 --> 19:48.412
It didn't feel like
my place to get involved.

19:48.545 --> 19:50.380
Your father is dead,

19:50.581 --> 19:52.715
your brother was nearly killed,

19:52.833 --> 19:55.635
your nephew's wife is being held hostage.

19:55.752 --> 19:57.002
What more needs to happen before

19:57.170 --> 20:00.589
you feel compelled to get involved?

20:00.723 --> 20:04.977
I'm just here to pay
respects to my father.

20:05.093 --> 20:08.512
How dare you.

20:08.679 --> 20:10.013
You can't pay your respects to

20:10.182 --> 20:13.651
a man who you disrespected your whole life.

20:13.768 --> 20:15.936
Who spent his whole life waiting

20:16.069 --> 20:19.939
for his son to come home to him.

20:20.155 --> 20:24.826
He loved you, and you broke his heart.

20:26.996 --> 20:28.363
I'm only glad that he died

20:28.497 --> 20:30.531
before he had to see you run away again.

20:30.698 --> 20:32.699
I am not running away.

20:32.834 --> 20:35.535
I'm going home.

20:35.669 --> 20:37.787
Must be nice.

20:37.921 --> 20:41.374
To absolve yourself of all responsibility.

20:41.508 --> 20:43.542
To have a place where you can go.

20:43.709 --> 20:46.044
Pasadena.

20:46.178 --> 20:49.848
Where the pain of your family
doesn't follow you.

20:53.184 --> 20:54.685
You think I couldn't have used

20:54.886 --> 20:58.305
a pasadena every once in a while?

21:34.641 --> 21:36.207
Put three on position two

21:36.256 --> 21:39.289
and one on position one, two contact.

21:41.876 --> 21:44.127
Bassam, what are you doing here?

21:44.260 --> 21:45.344
This is no place for you.

21:45.462 --> 21:48.380
What's the, uh, situation?

21:48.548 --> 21:51.183
You think I have time to brief you?

21:51.300 --> 21:54.268
Uncle, I understand that they're children.

21:54.886 --> 21:55.769
Who told you this?

21:55.887 --> 21:58.856
John Tucker?

21:59.056 --> 22:01.357
Of course. Who else?

22:01.475 --> 22:03.193
These americans...

22:03.310 --> 22:05.862
childhood in America is a different thing.

22:05.980 --> 22:08.281
Terrorists start young here,
like gymnasts.

22:08.481 --> 22:10.282
Have you offered them anything?

22:10.399 --> 22:11.282
Yes, 20 minutes before

22:11.401 --> 22:13.151
I go in and kill them all.

22:13.286 --> 22:14.369
Bassam...

22:14.486 --> 22:16.787
or should I call you Barry?

22:16.905 --> 22:20.291
This is not a game.

22:20.408 --> 22:22.492
Are your men in position?

22:22.627 --> 22:25.212
They're not talking to us, Fahmy.

22:25.328 --> 22:26.462
They won't negotiate.

22:26.581 --> 22:27.464
Then we'll kill her.

22:27.581 --> 22:28.380
Don't say that.

22:28.498 --> 22:29.248
Why not?

22:29.382 --> 22:33.802
Why does she deserve to live
any more than any of us?

22:33.919 --> 22:34.752
You're crazy.

22:34.920 --> 22:36.804
Because they are
making us crazy!

22:36.922 --> 22:39.390
My brother did nothing,
but they put him in prison.

22:39.508 --> 22:42.560
And he'll die there unless
I get him out.

22:53.437 --> 22:56.822
You have never seen
a woman's breasts before...

22:56.939 --> 22:58.523
have you?

22:58.658 --> 23:00.525
Not in real life.

23:00.660 --> 23:02.661
I always wanted to see them.

23:02.777 --> 23:03.911
In real life.

23:04.029 --> 23:05.446
There's a woman

23:05.579 --> 23:07.864
out there for you somewhere.

23:07.998 --> 23:09.782
But you'll never find her;

23:09.950 --> 23:11.751
not if you stay here.

23:14.371 --> 23:16.205
They're not watching the back door.

23:16.340 --> 23:18.958
You can untie me,
and we can walk out of here together.

23:19.092 --> 23:21.209
You don't deserve to die here.

23:26.514 --> 23:28.965
Sniper team has a line of sight
on one of the terrorists.

23:29.133 --> 23:30.634
Take one out and move on target.

23:30.768 --> 23:31.518
Uncle...

23:31.636 --> 23:33.470
We're done talking.

23:33.604 --> 23:35.388
No, we're not.

23:38.808 --> 23:40.442
Look, it's my niece in there.

23:40.560 --> 23:42.148
If you won't wait for my brother,

23:42.197 --> 23:45.647
then at least let me
go in and talk to them.

23:45.814 --> 23:46.864
So I can tell Jamal

23:46.981 --> 23:50.784
when he's out of surgery I let
his brother get himself killed?

23:50.902 --> 23:53.570
Go back to the palace, Bassam.

23:53.705 --> 23:55.656
Better yet, go home.

23:57.874 --> 23:58.658
You know what?

23:58.825 --> 23:59.875
I get it.

23:59.993 --> 24:02.878
You don't even want Nusrat to
get out of this, do you?

24:02.995 --> 24:04.557
Because if she lives,

24:05.142 --> 24:06.715
then you lose your excuse to crack down

24:06.832 --> 24:10.418
on Ihab and his followers.

24:10.552 --> 24:14.004
I won't even dignify
that with an answer.

24:14.139 --> 24:16.507
I'm going in there.

24:16.641 --> 24:18.425
Bassam!

24:21.895 --> 24:23.680
Let him go.

24:32.904 --> 24:35.740
Please, please, please...

24:35.857 --> 24:38.859
Idiot.

24:39.076 --> 24:40.610
I told you don't talk with her!

24:40.745 --> 24:43.446
You need to listen to me!

24:43.581 --> 24:45.415
What the hell are you doing?

24:45.533 --> 24:46.416
I'm not waiting for them

24:46.533 --> 24:47.533
to come in here and kill us.

24:47.667 --> 24:48.951
What about my brother, huh?

24:49.085 --> 24:49.668
Get up.

24:49.785 --> 24:50.368
Ali!

24:50.536 --> 24:52.503
I'm walking out with her,
and begging for our lives.

24:52.621 --> 24:54.422
Now you're the one who's crazy!

24:54.540 --> 24:55.923
You think they'll just let you go?

24:56.041 --> 24:57.041
We'll find out.

24:57.176 --> 24:58.626
Come on, let her go.

24:58.761 --> 24:59.677
Or what?

24:59.794 --> 25:00.677
You'll shoot me?

25:00.795 --> 25:01.628
If I have to.

25:01.763 --> 25:02.346
Guys.

25:02.463 --> 25:02.963
Shut up!

25:03.096 --> 25:04.296
Don't test me, Ali.

25:04.432 --> 25:04.965
Let go of her.

25:05.098 --> 25:07.550
Look.

25:10.103 --> 25:11.470
I'm unarmed.

25:12.105 --> 25:13.105
Don't come any closer.

25:13.222 --> 25:15.439
I just want to talk.

25:15.557 --> 25:16.390
I said don't move.

25:16.524 --> 25:18.358
Fahmy!

25:18.476 --> 25:20.393
Let's hear what he has to say.

25:22.980 --> 25:24.948
Fine.

25:25.066 --> 25:26.900
Slowly.

25:28.952 --> 25:32.238
You okay?

25:32.404 --> 25:34.873
Who are you?

25:34.990 --> 25:37.357
He asked you who you are.

25:38.961 --> 25:40.746
I'm Barry...

25:43.215 --> 25:44.498
Bassam Al Fayeed.

25:44.633 --> 25:46.834
Jamal's brother?

25:46.967 --> 25:48.334
And Khaled's son.

25:48.470 --> 25:50.671
See? He's an even
better hostage than she is.

25:50.804 --> 25:52.888
They will definitely trade him
for my brother.

25:53.006 --> 25:54.390
No.

25:54.507 --> 25:55.758
That's never gonna happen.

25:55.975 --> 25:57.893
But any minute now,

25:58.011 --> 26:01.847
Tariq's men are gonna come in here
and kill all three of you.

26:02.390 --> 26:04.014
None of us has to die.

26:04.148 --> 26:05.348
Not if you listen to me.

26:05.483 --> 26:07.795
Why should we listen to you
when no one listens to us?

26:07.844 --> 26:09.394
Let him talk.

26:09.687 --> 26:13.990
Tariq won't be satisfied with you,
do you understand?

26:14.190 --> 26:15.917
He'll go after your fathers

26:16.064 --> 26:20.412
and your uncles and your cousins.

26:20.530 --> 26:22.331
But if you put your weapons down

26:22.448 --> 26:23.498
and walk out of here with me,

26:23.615 --> 26:24.972
I promise you, I'll do everything I can

26:25.022 --> 26:26.457
to make sure you're fairly treated.

26:26.618 --> 26:27.117
Bullshit!

26:27.285 --> 26:27.835
Fahmy...

26:27.953 --> 26:29.003
He is Al Fayeed!

26:29.120 --> 26:31.955
Only an Al Fayeed
can save you now.

26:38.712 --> 26:40.880
You should have told me
he was coming.

26:41.014 --> 26:43.382
I won't forget you didn't.

26:45.601 --> 26:46.468
General.

26:46.636 --> 26:49.688
Coming out!

26:49.805 --> 26:51.105
Nusrat!

26:51.224 --> 26:54.059
Move in!

27:08.570 --> 27:10.371
Uncle.

27:12.708 --> 27:14.492
Please, let them go.

27:16.994 --> 27:19.913
Show them some mercy;
they're just kids.

27:22.132 --> 27:24.834
I gave them my word.

27:24.968 --> 27:27.837
Your word?

27:27.971 --> 27:29.805
As an Al Fayeed.

27:40.682 --> 27:41.710
A month from now,

27:41.760 --> 27:42.967
one of them would have turned up at

27:43.016 --> 27:46.560
a bus stop or a train station
wearing a bomb.

27:47.938 --> 27:49.739
Better their blood than ours.

28:02.951 --> 28:06.086
Bassam, come.

28:06.203 --> 28:09.038
You saved Nusrat.

28:09.206 --> 28:12.792
If not for you,
she would have been killed, too.

28:15.211 --> 28:17.012
Let's go.

28:34.286 --> 28:38.534
You suffered severe lacerations
and a lot of tissue damage,

28:38.583 --> 28:41.259
but we managed to repair
the pudendal vein and most of

28:41.337 --> 28:42.775
- the necrosis around the bulbar...
- English.

28:42.824 --> 28:44.614
Speak english.

28:45.053 --> 28:46.753
Did you fix me?

28:47.973 --> 28:49.269
The surgery was successful.

28:49.319 --> 28:50.924
You're not answering my question.

28:51.058 --> 28:53.331
I'm trying, Mr. President.

28:53.381 --> 28:55.845
Just tell me.

28:56.012 --> 28:57.430
Will it work again?

28:57.564 --> 28:59.014
It should.

28:59.148 --> 29:00.849
Eventually.

29:01.016 --> 29:04.402
But we'll know more once
you've had time to heal.

29:18.999 --> 29:23.753
You are enjoying this, aren't you?

29:29.304 --> 29:32.710
Dr. Cohen, could you
please wait for me outside?

29:32.877 --> 29:34.127
Of course.

29:34.262 --> 29:37.014
Mr. President.

29:42.719 --> 29:45.053
Jamal, your father,

29:45.188 --> 29:48.807
whom I loved very much, died

29:48.941 --> 29:52.110
the day of our son's wedding.

29:52.227 --> 29:55.107
Then, you nearly unmanned yourself

29:55.643 --> 29:58.116
and left me a widow.

30:01.735 --> 30:05.905
How could I possibly take
any pleasure in this?

30:09.125 --> 30:13.578
Did you hear what she called me?

30:13.712 --> 30:16.748
"Mr. President."

30:19.786 --> 30:22.892
Something happened
while you were in surgery...

30:24.088 --> 30:26.757
Mr. President.

30:33.179 --> 30:35.313
Thank you.

30:37.058 --> 30:39.531
My husband needs
to deliver the eulogy tomorrow

30:39.580 --> 30:41.602
at his father's funeral.

30:41.769 --> 30:43.319
He needs to be on his feet.

30:44.021 --> 30:46.272
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

30:46.440 --> 30:50.006
The president can't deliver the eulogy
from a wheelchair, can he?

30:50.900 --> 30:52.651
As long as he's careful.

30:52.731 --> 30:54.162
Good.

30:55.698 --> 30:59.255
I'd also like to remind you
to keep this confidential,

30:59.850 --> 31:01.173
because

31:01.688 --> 31:02.837
if the story leaks,

31:02.887 --> 31:04.011
or it's on twitter,

31:04.061 --> 31:05.705
there will be consequences.

31:06.605 --> 31:09.959
Don't threaten me,
Mrs. Al fayeed.

31:16.881 --> 31:18.990
Dr. Cohen...

31:19.768 --> 31:23.805
How old is your son now, Arya?

31:23.973 --> 31:25.690
Seven?

31:26.786 --> 31:30.195
I've been told
he has a beautiful smile.

31:32.813 --> 31:35.288
Thank you, doctor.

31:37.985 --> 31:40.152
How is he?

31:40.319 --> 31:42.070
Still Jamal.

31:42.205 --> 31:45.657
Can I go in?

31:48.210 --> 31:50.244
Bassam.

31:53.415 --> 31:56.133
Ahmed told me what you did.

32:04.757 --> 32:05.591
Hey, hey, hey, hey,

32:05.724 --> 32:06.807
hey, hey, hey.

32:06.925 --> 32:07.808
Okay. It's okay.

32:07.926 --> 32:10.344
It's okay. It's okay.

32:10.512 --> 32:12.230
It's all right.

32:12.347 --> 32:13.231
Shh. It's okay. Shh.

32:26.408 --> 32:29.694
Oh.

32:29.862 --> 32:33.114
You need to go to your brother.

32:51.130 --> 32:53.014
Jamal.

32:53.132 --> 32:54.883
Easy on the morphine.

32:55.016 --> 32:56.433
There he is.

32:56.551 --> 32:58.602
The great American hero.

33:00.152 --> 33:01.938
I doubt uncle Tariq would agree.

33:02.056 --> 33:03.106
Tariq.

33:03.307 --> 33:05.191
Father called him "the hammer."

33:05.309 --> 33:08.895
For him, every problem is a nail.

33:09.029 --> 33:13.616
But, you know,
sometimes you need a hammer.

33:17.152 --> 33:21.341
This motherless pig, Ihab Rashid...

33:21.441 --> 33:23.707
he tried to kill me.

33:24.606 --> 33:27.995
And he will try again
unless I kill him first.

33:28.212 --> 33:31.081
I need to be stronger, brother.

33:31.247 --> 33:33.082
Like father.

33:33.216 --> 33:38.971
You're ready for this, Jamal.

33:39.088 --> 33:41.172
Of course I am.

33:41.307 --> 33:44.175
Why wouldn't I be?

33:45.116 --> 33:47.281
Jamal, get out right now,

33:47.331 --> 33:48.263
- get out.
- No please.

33:48.313 --> 33:49.179
- Do you hear me?
- Please.

33:49.314 --> 33:51.431
Get out of the car.

33:51.565 --> 33:54.100
No.

33:58.321 --> 34:01.106
There.

34:01.273 --> 34:04.192
It's done.

34:04.327 --> 34:05.944
Leave him alone.

34:07.715 --> 34:11.248
My whole life I have been getting ready.

34:13.500 --> 34:16.869
I knew this day will come.

34:18.538 --> 34:20.121
Only, some part of me believed

34:20.289 --> 34:24.376
he will live forever.

34:24.509 --> 34:31.181
I keep expecting him to walk
through that door.

34:32.299 --> 34:35.301
Angry, of course.

34:45.561 --> 34:48.362
How do you work this?

34:54.235 --> 34:56.119
Hey.

34:56.237 --> 34:58.405
You been up this whole time?

34:59.953 --> 35:01.724
I keep thinking about those boys.

35:01.774 --> 35:04.794
Oh... baby.

35:04.911 --> 35:05.961
That's not your fault.

35:06.078 --> 35:10.298
You did everything you could.

35:10.416 --> 35:13.218
Yeah.

35:13.334 --> 35:16.136
You saved Nusrat.

35:28.615 --> 35:31.377
I understand their anger...

35:31.696 --> 35:33.768
powerlessness.

35:36.478 --> 35:40.024
When I was their age, I was so ashamed.

35:41.158 --> 35:42.108
"What does your family do?"

35:42.242 --> 35:44.860
"Oh, us? We're in the oppression business."

35:45.132 --> 35:47.885
Oh, I think it was a little more
complicated than that.

35:48.044 --> 35:51.536
Yeah, but... I was a teenager.

35:51.677 --> 35:54.641
I thought I only had bad choices.

35:55.030 --> 35:58.088
Live with this obscene privilege

35:58.932 --> 36:01.666
and pretend like
there's no price to any of it,

36:01.784 --> 36:04.043
or protest on the streets
against my own father.

36:05.045 --> 36:07.577
Fauzi could speak his mind.
I couldn't.

36:10.195 --> 36:12.212
And so I ran away.

36:14.186 --> 36:16.721
Denied all of it.

36:16.888 --> 36:18.996
Watched thousands
of hours of american TV

36:19.046 --> 36:21.311
so I didn't even sound like them.

36:24.572 --> 36:26.947
When I first met you,

36:27.064 --> 36:29.330
buried in your books,

36:29.703 --> 36:31.831
I knew you were hiding.

36:32.352 --> 36:34.737
I wanted to call you Bassam, remember?

36:34.903 --> 36:37.655
I thought it was a beautiful name.

36:37.790 --> 36:38.740
But you wouldn't let me.

36:38.907 --> 36:41.214
You said you were Barry now.

36:43.623 --> 36:47.590
And those arguments I made
don't seem to hold up so well anymore.

36:49.093 --> 36:51.006
Not with my father gone.

36:56.605 --> 36:59.507
I'm an Al Fayeed.

37:01.847 --> 37:04.364
That means I'm a powerful man here.

37:06.264 --> 37:09.036
Even if I run away again,

37:10.536 --> 37:12.651
isn't that still on my head?

37:13.594 --> 37:16.541
Whenever Tariq acts in my brother's name,

37:16.803 --> 37:18.021
whenever Jamal is too weak to say,

37:18.072 --> 37:20.096
"no, enough,"

37:21.835 --> 37:26.114
won't there be blood on my hands
no matter how far away I run?

37:27.441 --> 37:30.406
Are you asking
my permission to stay?

37:33.514 --> 37:35.626
I look at those boys.

37:36.230 --> 37:38.529
They died for their brother.

37:40.665 --> 37:42.667
Now what do I say to mine?

38:18.413 --> 38:19.941
How friggin' crazy is this?

38:20.056 --> 38:21.371
How crazy is it
what dad did yesterday?

38:21.421 --> 38:22.871
I mean, what the hell?

38:23.271 --> 38:25.585
That was actually pretty cool.

38:25.720 --> 38:27.101
It was totally reckless.

38:27.177 --> 38:29.351
What, dad's some kind of action hero
all of a sudden?

38:29.401 --> 38:30.721
It's dad.

38:31.899 --> 38:35.357
This... the whole weekend has
been completely surreal.

38:57.113 --> 38:58.047
Thank you.

38:58.114 --> 38:59.331
Thank you.

39:01.417 --> 39:03.168
You doing all right?

39:03.285 --> 39:04.252
Yeah.

39:04.370 --> 39:06.254
Bassam.

39:06.372 --> 39:09.958
I'll be right back.

39:10.125 --> 39:11.458
Yeah?

39:11.626 --> 39:14.094
Tell my wife I can't read this shit.

39:14.212 --> 39:15.095
You approved it.

39:15.212 --> 39:17.180
I was medicated.

39:17.297 --> 39:20.967
This is no eulogy for a son to
say over his father.

39:21.101 --> 39:24.137
These are empty words written by a flunky.

39:24.270 --> 39:25.137
These people...

39:25.271 --> 39:29.115
the entire nation... are expecting
their new president to pay tribute.

39:29.165 --> 39:30.259
Let me talk to my brother.

39:30.308 --> 39:33.060
No, there is no other speech, Bassam.

39:40.067 --> 39:40.984
See?

39:41.151 --> 39:44.453
It's bullshit.

39:44.571 --> 39:46.572
You in pain?

39:46.705 --> 39:47.655
How much, out of ten?

39:47.824 --> 39:48.657
Eleven.

39:48.824 --> 39:50.291
Did you take anything?

39:50.410 --> 39:51.326
I'm eulogizing our

39:51.493 --> 39:52.994
father, Bassam.

39:53.162 --> 39:56.547
I need my wits.

40:00.273 --> 40:03.302
What do you think
I should say, Bassam?

40:03.421 --> 40:07.224
Forget the speech.

40:07.340 --> 40:10.226
And say what?

40:10.342 --> 40:14.396
Hey, just tell them the truth.

40:26.156 --> 40:28.221
Why do you have the speech?

40:28.312 --> 40:31.194
It's okay.

41:07.809 --> 41:10.560
My family,

41:10.727 --> 41:14.396
fellow countrymen,

41:14.564 --> 41:17.733
and visiting friends.

41:17.901 --> 41:21.654
I am here...

41:37.751 --> 41:39.802
It...

41:39.919 --> 41:45.640
It wasn't always easy being
my father's son.

41:50.250 --> 41:55.265
In fact, it was never easy.

41:57.017 --> 42:04.440
My father was a hard man to please.

42:04.574 --> 42:06.658
Stubborn.

42:06.776 --> 42:09.528
Demanding.

42:09.661 --> 42:12.580
But only a hard, stubborn,

42:12.698 --> 42:18.289
demanding man could have healed
the deep wounds

42:18.379 --> 42:24.424
inflicted by generations of civil strife

42:24.540 --> 42:29.377
and forged a lasting peace.

42:29.512 --> 42:33.181
Only a hard, stubborn,

42:33.299 --> 42:35.483
demanding man

42:35.738 --> 42:41.139
could have summoned the strength

42:41.306 --> 42:44.808
to unite this great nation

42:44.975 --> 42:51.814
and lead it into the community of nations.

42:51.981 --> 42:56.651
Today I stand before you

42:56.785 --> 43:01.405
to remember not just the ruler,

43:01.540 --> 43:04.158
but the man.

43:04.675 --> 43:09.916
Not just the father who raised
this great nation,

43:10.125 --> 43:12.293
but my father,

43:12.412 --> 43:15.946
who raised me

43:16.266 --> 43:19.109
and my brother.

43:19.257 --> 43:24.083
Who taught us that without family,

43:24.977 --> 43:28.512
we have nothing.

43:28.679 --> 43:30.814
Without family,

43:30.932 --> 43:33.183
we are nothing.

43:38.271 --> 43:40.105
You okay?

44:15.269 --> 44:17.553
Hello.

44:17.721 --> 44:22.558
Jamal, it's, uh, it's me, Bassam.

44:22.725 --> 44:26.144
So, um...

44:26.278 --> 44:31.449
What would you think
if I hung around for a while?

44:32.065 --> 44:33.366
Oh, Bassam.

44:34.981 --> 44:37.402
Is that the vicodin talking
or is that a yes?

44:38.537 --> 44:40.070
That is a yes, yes.

44:42.200 --> 44:44.525
Thank you, little brother.
