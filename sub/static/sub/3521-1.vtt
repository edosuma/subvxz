01:57.083 --> 02:00.086
Mr. Soprano?

02:00.086 --> 02:02.589
Yeah.

02:13.099 --> 02:15.101
Have a seat.

02:43.630 --> 02:46.633
My understanding
from dr. Cusamano,

02:46.633 --> 02:49.636
your family physician,
is that you collapsed.

02:50.136 --> 02:52.138
Possibly
a panic attack.

02:52.138 --> 02:54.140
You were
unable to breathe.

02:54.140 --> 02:56.142
Theysaid it was
a panic attack...

02:56.142 --> 03:00.897
'cause the blood work
and neurological work
came back negative.

03:02.398 --> 03:04.400
And they sent me here.

03:04.534 --> 03:06.536
You don't agree
that you had a panic attack.

03:09.539 --> 03:12.041
How are you feeling now?

03:12.041 --> 03:14.043
Good.

03:14.043 --> 03:17.547
Fine.
Back at work.

03:17.547 --> 03:19.549
What line of work
are you in?

03:19.549 --> 03:22.669
Waste management consultant.

03:28.675 --> 03:32.679
Look, it's impossible
for me to talk
to a psychiatrist.

03:32.679 --> 03:36.683
Any thoughts at all
on why you blacked out?

03:38.685 --> 03:42.188
I dunno. Stress, maybe.

03:43.189 --> 03:45.692
About what?

03:52.081 --> 03:54.617
I don't know.

03:54.617 --> 03:57.620
The morning
of the day i got sick,
i'd been thinking.

04:00.623 --> 04:03.126
It's good to be in something
from the ground floor.

04:03.126 --> 04:06.129
I came too late for that.
I know.

04:06.129 --> 04:10.133
But lately,
i'm gettin' the feelin'
that i came in at the end.

04:10.133 --> 04:12.135
The best is over.

04:12.635 --> 04:16.639
Many americans, i think,
feel that way.

04:16.639 --> 04:21.144
I think about my father. He
never reached heights like me.

04:21.144 --> 04:24.647
But in a lot of ways,
he had it better.
He had his people.

04:24.647 --> 04:27.650
They had their standards.
They had pride.

04:28.151 --> 04:30.653
Today, what do we got?

04:34.157 --> 04:38.911
Did you have these feelings of
loss more acutely in the hours
before you collapsed?

04:39.162 --> 04:42.165
I don't know.

04:56.062 --> 04:59.932
- A couple of
months before,

05:00.066 --> 05:03.069
these two wild ducks
landed in my pool.

05:03.319 --> 05:08.574
It was amazing. They're
from canada or someplace,
and it was matin' season.

05:09.075 --> 05:11.077
They had some ducklings.

05:17.583 --> 05:19.836
Here you go.
Here you go.

05:24.457 --> 05:27.460
My daughter's friend was there
to drive my daughter, meadow,
to school.

05:27.460 --> 05:29.962
Meadow, your father
with those ducks.

05:29.962 --> 05:32.965
I know. The whole yard
smells like duck poop.
It's embarrassing.

05:32.965 --> 05:38.104
Girls, you gotta have more
than just cranberry juice.
You need brain food.

05:38.104 --> 05:41.607
Happy birthday! Thirteen.
He doesn't act it.

05:41.607 --> 05:44.610
The male and female duck
made a home in your pool
and did it.

05:44.610 --> 05:48.114
- Eeew. Get outta here.
- Disgusting.

05:48.114 --> 05:52.118
Girls, you want some
of last night'ssfogliatell?

05:52.118 --> 05:56.873
- Get outta here with that fat.
- One bite.
- How do you stay so skinny?

06:00.626 --> 06:02.628
Him with those ducks.

06:02.995 --> 06:06.999
If you don't like that ramp,
i'll build you another one.
Maybe it's the wood.

06:10.002 --> 06:13.005
Hey, kids, come here!
They're trying to fly!

06:13.005 --> 06:16.509
- Come here. The babies--
they're trying to fly. -

06:16.509 --> 06:19.011
look!
They're trying to fly.

06:20.263 --> 06:22.765
National geographic, dad.
Super.

06:23.266 --> 06:26.402
You showed us yesterday.
It's great!

06:26.402 --> 06:30.773
Now, my wife feels this friend
is a bad influence.

06:30.773 --> 06:34.277
That's so cool you're gonna
be able to come to aspen
with my family at christmas.

06:34.277 --> 06:36.279
Last year,
i saw skeet ulrich.

06:36.279 --> 06:38.781
As close as from
where you're sitting.
Oh, my god.

06:38.781 --> 06:40.783
Miss meadow,
we made a deal--

06:40.783 --> 06:43.286
you keep your school grades up
and you keep your curfew...

06:43.286 --> 06:45.788
between now and christmas,
then you get to go.

06:45.788 --> 06:47.790
I know that.

06:47.790 --> 06:49.792
Good morning, ladies.
Hey, mr. Soprano.

06:49.792 --> 06:52.295
We're late, dad.
Hey! Happy birthday.

06:52.295 --> 06:54.797
Thanks, dad.

07:00.303 --> 07:05.308
You're gonna be home
for anthony junior's
birthday party, right?

07:07.310 --> 07:09.312
Bird man, hello.

07:09.312 --> 07:12.315
Yeah. Yeah. I'll
get home early from work.

07:12.315 --> 07:15.318
I'm not
talking about work.

07:18.070 --> 07:20.573
This isn't gonna work.
I can't talk
about my personal life.

07:20.573 --> 07:23.576
Finish telling me
about the day you collapsed.

07:27.463 --> 07:31.968
I drove to work
with my nephew, christopher.
He's learning the business.

07:31.968 --> 07:33.970
He's an example of what
i was talking about before.

07:34.470 --> 07:38.975
Did you call what's- his- name
at triboro towers
about the hauling contract?

07:39.475 --> 07:43.980
I got home too late
last night. I didn't
want to wake the man up.

07:43.980 --> 07:47.984
Did you get up early
this morning and call?
He's in his office by 6:00.

07:47.984 --> 07:51.988
I was nauseous this morning.
My mother told me i
shouldn't even come in.

07:51.988 --> 07:56.108
Bear in mind,
this is a kid who just
bought himself a $60, 000 lexus.

08:02.615 --> 08:04.617
There's that guy mahaffey.
Get out.

08:05.117 --> 08:08.120
Yeah, right there
next to the boo- boo in pink.

08:08.120 --> 08:10.122
Back up.

08:21.133 --> 08:25.638
My friend mahaffey.
Pulling his taffy.
Hello.

08:25.638 --> 08:29.892
We saw this guy,
and there was this issue
of an oustandin' loan.

08:29.892 --> 08:33.279
Can i stop you for a second?

08:33.279 --> 08:35.780
I don't know where
this story is going.

08:36.782 --> 08:39.284
But there are a few
ethical ground rules...

08:39.284 --> 08:42.788
we should quickly
get out of the way.

08:42.788 --> 08:48.294
What you
tell me here falls under
doctor/patient confidentiality.

08:48.294 --> 08:52.798
Except, if i was, uh--
if i was to hear,

08:53.299 --> 08:55.801
let's say, a murder
was to take place.

08:55.801 --> 08:57.803
Not that i'm saying it would,
but if--

08:57.803 --> 09:02.308
if a patient comes to me
and tells me a story where
someone's going to get hurt,

09:02.308 --> 09:04.810
i'm supposed to go
to the authorities.

09:05.811 --> 09:07.813
Technically.

09:11.434 --> 09:13.936
You said you were
in waste management.

09:13.936 --> 09:18.824
- Environment.
- Dr. Cusamano, besides
being your family physician,

09:18.824 --> 09:22.078
is also your
next- door neighbor.

09:22.078 --> 09:24.580
See what i'm saying?

09:24.580 --> 09:27.083
I don't know what happened
with this fellow,

09:27.083 --> 09:29.585
i- i'm just saying.

09:31.087 --> 09:34.707
Nothing. We had coffee.

09:36.842 --> 09:40.596
- Help!
-

09:45.601 --> 09:49.221
security! Help!
- Aw, shit!

10:08.124 --> 10:11.744
- Asshole!
-

10:13.245 --> 10:16.749
tony! Wait up!

10:23.005 --> 10:26.642
Security!
Hey, security!

10:49.165 --> 10:51.167
You all right?

10:51.167 --> 10:53.669
My leg is broken!
The bone's coming
through.

10:53.669 --> 10:55.671
Oh, let me see.

10:55.671 --> 10:59.425
I'll give you
a fuckin' bone, you prick!
Where's my fuckin' money?

10:59.425 --> 11:02.678
- So you had coffee.
- Right.

11:02.928 --> 11:06.682
- ...your fuckin' face,
motherfucker!
-

11:09.552 --> 11:14.190
- what are you doing? Get
over here! Get over here!
- That's $3, 000. $3, 000.

11:14.690 --> 11:16.692
Go ahead.

11:19.061 --> 11:22.198
- Where's our fuckin' money?
- I'll get the money.

11:22.314 --> 11:24.316
I know you'll get
the fuckin' money.

11:24.316 --> 11:26.318
Know what you should get?
A cork in your fuckin' mouth,
'cause you tell people...

11:26.318 --> 11:28.821
i'm nothing
compared to the people
that used to run things.

11:29.205 --> 11:31.824
I'm sorry!
- You prick! -

11:32.324 --> 11:35.828
i'm nothing?

11:37.830 --> 11:40.833
Shut up!

11:40.833 --> 11:44.086
What are you crying about?
H. M. O.!

11:44.086 --> 11:46.589
Huh?
You're covered, you prick!

11:47.590 --> 11:50.092
Degenerate fuckin' gambler.

11:50.226 --> 11:51.727
Go on.

11:52.228 --> 11:54.230
Next day,
i had a breakfast meeting.

11:54.230 --> 11:57.233
I was called in to consult
by a garbage company
i represent.

11:57.483 --> 11:59.485
Big, what's the story
with triboro towers?

11:59.735 --> 12:02.738
The site manager wants to
renew his contract with dick,

12:02.855 --> 12:04.356
but this kolar
sanitation--

12:04.857 --> 12:06.358
another nationwide company.

12:06.859 --> 12:10.863
The kolar brothers, some kind
of czechoslovakian immigrants.

12:10.863 --> 12:13.365
These polacks, they'll haul
paper, plastic and aluminum...

12:13.365 --> 12:15.868
for 7, 000 a month
less than dick.

12:16.001 --> 12:18.504
So they pay us
40 times the monthly
for stealin' your stop.

12:18.504 --> 12:20.506
That's the thing--
they won't.

12:20.506 --> 12:24.009
He says if he can
tell commie bosses
in czechoslovakia...

12:24.009 --> 12:27.012
to go fuck themselves,
he can fuckin' tell us.
Oh!

12:27.379 --> 12:29.882
I give up.
Fuckin' garbage
business.

12:30.382 --> 12:32.384
Yeah, i know.
It's all changing.

12:32.384 --> 12:34.386
Let me see what i can do.

12:34.520 --> 12:37.523
Are you sure?
You over your stomachache?

12:37.523 --> 12:39.525
Oh, yeah.
Good.

12:40.526 --> 12:42.528
What are you
doin' here?
Hey.

12:42.528 --> 12:46.532
Gabriella sends me down here
for thecapicollo.
Best in the area.

12:46.649 --> 12:48.150
Hey, t,
let me ask you something--

12:48.651 --> 12:51.654
you used to go to school
with a guy named artie bucco?

12:52.037 --> 12:55.040
This situation came up.
It involves my uncle.

12:55.040 --> 12:57.042
I can't go into details
on this one.

12:57.543 --> 12:59.545
That's fine.
But i will say this:

12:59.545 --> 13:02.915
My uncle adds
to my general stress level.

13:03.165 --> 13:07.169
It's none of my business,
but down at the club...

13:07.670 --> 13:11.674
word is your uncle junior
is gonna whack pussy malanga.

13:14.310 --> 13:17.813
He's gonna do it at your friend
artie bucco's restaurant.

13:27.940 --> 13:29.942
Hey, boys.
How are you?

13:32.945 --> 13:35.447
Don't move.
Uncle jun',
how you doin'?

13:36.949 --> 13:38.951
Hey, good to see you.

13:38.951 --> 13:40.953
Hiya, chris.
Hey, uncle junior.

13:40.953 --> 13:42.955
I was just
talking about you.

13:42.955 --> 13:44.957
It's anthony junior's
birthday dinner tonight?

13:45.457 --> 13:47.459
Yeah. Don't
buy anything big.

13:47.459 --> 13:50.963
We overindulge him,
okay?

13:51.463 --> 13:53.966
Hey!
Oh! Artie,
how's your rash?

13:53.966 --> 13:55.968
It's itchy.
Come here.

13:58.854 --> 14:00.856
Good to see you.
Can you come over?
Yeah. Have a seat.

14:03.859 --> 14:07.863
You know what it means for
arthur, one of these old mutts
gets wet in here?

14:07.863 --> 14:10.866
Yeah. It'll
ruin his business.

14:11.367 --> 14:13.369
You better sit down
with your uncle.

14:15.988 --> 14:18.490
Uncle junior's
my father's brother.

14:18.991 --> 14:21.493
Good guy.
Just gettin' old. Cranky.

14:23.495 --> 14:26.332
Used to take me to yankee games
when i was a kid.

14:26.332 --> 14:28.717
I love my uncle.

14:29.718 --> 14:32.721
At the same time,
when i was young,

14:32.721 --> 14:36.225
he told my girl cousins i would
never be a varsity athlete,
and frankly,

14:36.225 --> 14:40.229
that was a tremendous blow
to my self- esteem.

15:03.118 --> 15:06.622
Who's there?
It's me, ma.

15:06.622 --> 15:09.124
Who are you?

15:09.124 --> 15:12.127
Ma, open the door.

15:14.630 --> 15:17.633
Anthony?
Yeah, it's me.
Open the door.

15:22.638 --> 15:25.140
Hi, how are you?

15:25.140 --> 15:28.777
Geez, ma,
get some air in here.

15:29.278 --> 15:31.280
You lock the door
after you?

15:31.780 --> 15:36.285
Yeah. I did.
Somebody called here
last night after dark.

15:36.785 --> 15:40.289
Who?
You think i'd answer?
It was dark out.

15:40.289 --> 15:42.291
Ma, i'll never
understand that.

15:42.291 --> 15:45.294
The phone is an auditory thing.
Dark is an eye thing.

15:45.294 --> 15:47.796
I can understand
not going out after dark,

15:47.796 --> 15:49.798
but not answering
the phone after dark?

15:49.798 --> 15:52.301
Oh, listen to him.
He knows everything.

15:52.301 --> 15:54.803
You want some lunch?
I got eggplant.

15:54.803 --> 15:56.805
No. No.
I just ate.

15:56.805 --> 15:59.308
Know who i just ran into?
Uncle jun'.

15:59.808 --> 16:04.813
You think he ever
comes to see
his sister- in- law?

16:04.813 --> 16:06.815
Yeah. Remember
artie bucco?

16:07.316 --> 16:09.818
Kid i went
to elementary school with?
Artie!

16:09.818 --> 16:12.321
Oh! Yeah, i still
see his mother.

16:14.323 --> 16:19.828
She tells me
he calls her
every day.

16:19.828 --> 16:22.331
Yeah. Well.

16:22.331 --> 16:24.333
Uncle jun's gonna
make a problem for artie.

16:24.333 --> 16:26.335
Could affect
his livelihood.
What's that?

16:26.335 --> 16:28.837
Cd player.

16:28.837 --> 16:31.790
For who?
For me?
Yeah.

16:31.790 --> 16:34.293
I don't want it.
You don't want it?

16:34.293 --> 16:36.795
You love music. All the old
stuff is being reissued on cd.

16:36.795 --> 16:40.799
All your old favorites.
Pajama game, connie francis.

16:40.799 --> 16:42.801
Here.

16:48.807 --> 16:52.811
Come on.
Come on.
What? What?

16:56.815 --> 16:58.317
Ma, you need something
to occupy your mind.

16:58.817 --> 17:02.321
When dad died, you were going
to do all kinds of things.
Oh, he was a saint.

17:02.321 --> 17:04.823
Yeah, i know he was,
but he's gone.

17:04.823 --> 17:07.826
You were gonna travel,
get a volunteer job.

17:07.826 --> 17:10.829
Stop tellin' me
how to live my life.
Just shut up.

17:11.329 --> 17:16.335
- I just worry about you.
- Don't start with that
nursing home again.

17:16.335 --> 17:20.339
It's not a nursing home!
It's a retirement community.

17:20.339 --> 17:24.343
You're with active seniors
your own age. You go places.
You do things.

17:24.343 --> 17:29.848
I've seen these women in these
nursing homes in wheelchairs
babbling like idiots.

17:30.349 --> 17:34.353
- Here, eat your eggplant.
- I told you, i already
ate lunch.

17:37.856 --> 17:39.858
All right, listen.

17:40.359 --> 17:42.861
You just speak to uncle junior
about artie, okay?

17:43.362 --> 17:45.364
He respects you.
He'll listen to you.

17:45.364 --> 17:47.866
If your uncle has business
with arthur,

17:47.866 --> 17:50.369
he knows what he's doing.

17:52.871 --> 17:55.007
And i don't?

17:56.508 --> 17:58.510
Well, all i know is...

17:59.011 --> 18:03.132
daughters are better at
taking care of their mothers
than sons.

18:03.132 --> 18:06.135
Yeah, and i bought cds
for a broken record.

18:10.889 --> 18:14.893
I expect to see you tonight at
anthony junior's birthday party
with your baked ziti.

18:14.893 --> 18:17.896
Only if i'm picked up
and brought back home.

18:17.896 --> 18:21.400
I don't drive
when they're
predicting rain.

18:21.400 --> 18:23.902
You're a healthy girl.
It's good for you to drive.

18:23.902 --> 18:26.405
Use it or lose it.
I gotta go to work.

18:26.905 --> 18:29.408
Sure. Run off.

18:32.010 --> 18:34.746
And that night
was my son's birthday party.

18:34.746 --> 18:37.249
My wife invites the priest.
He's always at the house.

18:37.249 --> 18:39.251
Hey, tony.
How you doin'?

18:39.251 --> 18:41.753
You likecreme anglais?
You bless it,
i'll eat it.

18:41.753 --> 18:44.756
She's not coming.
Grandma just called.
Who?

18:44.756 --> 18:46.758
She started crying
and hung up.

18:46.758 --> 18:48.760
She needs
a purpose in life.

18:48.760 --> 18:50.762
Your mother is tougher
than you think.

18:50.762 --> 18:53.765
So what?
No fuckin' ziti now?
Hey!

19:23.512 --> 19:29.017
At first, it felt like
ginger ale in my skull.

19:39.528 --> 19:41.029
Mom, daddy just fell! Mom!

19:41.530 --> 19:45.534
Tony!
Dad!

19:45.534 --> 19:48.537
Get back!
Madonna mia!

19:48.537 --> 19:51.039
Daddy! Dad!

19:51.039 --> 19:54.543
Anthony jr. , call 911.

20:06.722 --> 20:09.057
Dr. Cusamano
put me in the hospital.

20:09.057 --> 20:11.009
Gave me every kind of test.

20:11.443 --> 20:15.597
When you're in the m. R. I. ,
there's a microphone if
you get claustrophobia.

20:15.597 --> 20:20.919
I suggest you don't do that
because we have to start
over from the beginning.

20:20.919 --> 20:22.905
Okay.

20:26.825 --> 20:28.827
Hey, carm.

20:32.331 --> 20:34.333
I thought you might
want some company.

20:34.833 --> 20:37.452
Yeah.

20:37.452 --> 20:39.955
6:30 in the morning.

20:41.456 --> 20:43.458
How are the kids?

20:43.458 --> 20:45.961
They're worried
about you.

20:45.961 --> 20:50.215
I told anthony jr.
We'd rain- check his birthday.
Okay.

20:56.855 --> 20:59.224
Think i got a brain tumor?

20:59.224 --> 21:01.226
Well, we're gonna
find out.

21:01.610 --> 21:04.730
What a bedside manner.
Very encouraging.

21:04.730 --> 21:07.115
What are you gonna?
Not know?

21:10.619 --> 21:12.988
We had some good times.

21:12.988 --> 21:15.991
Had some good years.
Here he goes
with the nostalgia.

21:16.375 --> 21:18.377
Hey, all i'm sayin'
is no marriage is perfect.

21:18.377 --> 21:20.379
Well, havin' that
gumaon the side helps.

21:20.495 --> 21:22.631
I told you i'm not
seeing her anymore.

21:22.631 --> 21:25.751
- How do you think i feel
having that priest around?
- Don't even go there!

21:25.751 --> 21:28.253
Father is
a spiritual mentor.

21:28.253 --> 21:30.255
He's helping me
to be a better catholic.

21:30.255 --> 21:33.258
Yeah. Well, we all
got different needs.

21:33.392 --> 21:37.396
What's different between
you and me is you're going
to hell when you die!

21:54.413 --> 21:56.915
My nephew christopher...

21:57.416 --> 21:59.418
was handling
the garbage contract problem.

21:59.418 --> 22:03.922
But on this,
i will also not go into detail.

22:18.937 --> 22:23.442
Emile kolar.
Chris moltisante.

22:23.942 --> 22:27.446
In czech republic, too,
we love pork.

22:27.446 --> 22:29.948
You ever have
our sausages?

22:29.948 --> 22:34.953
No. I thought the only
sausages was italian
and jimmy dean's.

22:34.953 --> 22:38.457
See what you learn
when you cross cultures
and shit.

22:39.458 --> 22:41.460
My uncle evzen
doesn't know i came.

22:41.960 --> 22:43.962
If we make progress,
i'll have to tell him.

22:44.463 --> 22:48.467
We have
to make progress,"e- mail."
We gotta stop the madness.

22:48.467 --> 22:50.969
The garbage business
is changing.

22:50.969 --> 22:54.973
You and i of
the younger generation,
we have issues in common.

22:54.973 --> 22:59.478
"Emile."
Where'd you go
to high school?

22:59.478 --> 23:03.482
Was it poland?
I'm not polish.

23:03.982 --> 23:06.985
Czechoslovakian, what's that?
A type of polack, right?

23:06.985 --> 23:10.489
We came to this country
when i was nine.
I went to west essex.

23:10.489 --> 23:12.491
Yo, money. You used to play
my cousin in football.

23:12.491 --> 23:14.993
- He went to boon--
- where's the stuff?

23:14.993 --> 23:17.496
Yes. Yes, yes.

23:18.997 --> 23:20.999
The reason for the visit.

23:20.999 --> 23:24.503
I got it all deployed
for you.

23:24.503 --> 23:26.872
Taste the wares,"e- mail."

23:26.872 --> 23:28.874
"Emile."

23:53.148 --> 23:56.151
The doctors kept me hangin'
about the tests.

23:56.651 --> 23:58.653
As doctors will do.

23:58.653 --> 24:02.157
So my uncle and i played a round
of golf and had lunch.

24:02.157 --> 24:06.044
You keep mentioning your uncle.
What seems to be the problem?

24:06.044 --> 24:10.048
Who do you think you are?
The person who says
how things go.

24:10.048 --> 24:13.051
Now, listen,
artie's business...

24:13.051 --> 24:15.053
is nice, upscale people
from the suburbs.

24:15.053 --> 24:17.055
Don't ruin his life.

24:17.556 --> 24:19.558
Vesuvio is where pussy
feels safe.

24:20.058 --> 24:21.560
He's been eating here
all his life.

24:22.060 --> 24:24.563
Hey, you kill him
someplace else.

24:24.563 --> 24:28.066
You may run north jersey,
but you don't run
your uncle junior.

24:28.066 --> 24:32.070
How many fuckin'
hours did i play
catch with you?

24:36.074 --> 24:39.694
Can we focus more
on your immediate family?

24:39.694 --> 24:42.197
My wife and my daughter
were not getting along.

24:42.581 --> 24:46.084
Your husband
plowed under his corn
to build a baseball field.

24:46.084 --> 24:48.587
These laser discs
are incredible.

24:49.087 --> 24:52.591
Tony watchesgodfather ii
all the time.

24:52.591 --> 24:55.093
He says the camera work
looks as good as in the theater.

24:55.093 --> 24:57.596
Gordon willis. Tony
prefersii, noti?

24:57.596 --> 25:00.599
Yeah. He likes the part
where vito goes back to sicily.

25:00.599 --> 25:03.101
Iiiwas, like,
what happened?

25:03.101 --> 25:05.103
Where does tony
rankgoodfellas?

25:07.105 --> 25:09.107
Do you have racoons?

25:09.608 --> 25:11.610
Somebody's
jimmying the window.
What?

25:12.110 --> 25:15.113
You have all these
security lights.
Who would try--

25:16.114 --> 25:19.117
oh, no.
Geez louise.

25:19.367 --> 25:20.869
Hold it!

25:21.369 --> 25:23.488
Meadow.

25:23.989 --> 25:28.627
I notice the glass rattles
every time i walk
to the laundry room.

25:28.627 --> 25:30.629
Do we have any,
what- ya- call- it, putty?

25:30.629 --> 25:33.131
Don't give me that.
You snuck out!

25:33.131 --> 25:37.135
- What's going on?
- You locked my bedroom window
on purpose so i'd get caught.

25:37.636 --> 25:41.139
Normal people thought
you were doing your homework!

25:41.139 --> 25:44.142
You have become a master
of lying and conniving.

25:44.392 --> 25:45.894
Yeah, i know i'm grounded,

25:46.394 --> 25:48.897
but patrick's swim meet
is tomorrow and he needed me!

25:49.147 --> 25:53.151
Grounded for this?
Oh, no, you're not grounded.

25:53.151 --> 25:56.905
You're not going
to aspen, that's where
you're not going.

25:56.905 --> 25:58.657
Yes!

25:58.773 --> 26:02.410
But this shit i'm tellin' ya,
it'll all blow over.

26:04.913 --> 26:06.915
Didn't you admit
to dr. Cusamano...

26:07.415 --> 26:09.417
that you were
feeling depressed?

26:21.046 --> 26:23.431
Melfi.

26:24.432 --> 26:26.434
What part of the boot
you from, hon?

26:26.935 --> 26:29.437
Dr. Melfi.

26:29.437 --> 26:32.440
My father's people
were from caserta.

26:32.440 --> 26:34.442
Avellino.

26:34.442 --> 26:37.445
My mother would've loved it
if you and i got together.

26:44.319 --> 26:49.324
Anxiety attacks are legitimate
psychiatric emergencies.

26:49.324 --> 26:51.326
Suppose you were driving
and you passed out?

26:51.326 --> 26:55.330
Let me tell you something.
Nowadays, everybody's
gotta go to shrinks...

26:55.330 --> 26:59.834
and counselors and go on
sally jesse raphael
and talk about their problems.

26:59.834 --> 27:03.338
Whatever happened
to gary cooper?

27:03.338 --> 27:06.841
The strong, silent type.
That was an american.

27:06.841 --> 27:08.843
He wasn't in touch
with his feelings.

27:08.843 --> 27:10.845
He just did
what he had to do.

27:10.845 --> 27:13.348
See, what they didn't know
is once they got gary cooper...

27:13.848 --> 27:16.351
in touch with his feelings,
they wouldn't be able
to shut him up.

27:16.351 --> 27:18.853
Then it's dysfunction
this and that,
dysfunctionvaffancul!

27:18.853 --> 27:23.358
You have strong feelings
about this.

27:23.358 --> 27:25.360
I had a semester
and a half of college.

27:25.360 --> 27:29.364
I understand freud.
I understand therapy
as a concept.

27:29.364 --> 27:31.866
But in my world,
it does not go down.

27:33.868 --> 27:37.372
Could i be happier?
Yeah. Who couldn't?

27:37.372 --> 27:40.375
Do you feel depressed?

27:41.876 --> 27:44.379
Do you feel depressed?

27:49.884 --> 27:54.389
Since the ducks left.
I guess.

27:54.389 --> 27:58.393
The ducks that preceded
your losing consciousness.

27:58.393 --> 28:01.396
Let's talk about them.

28:14.542 --> 28:18.046
You can't blame t
for being pissed.
You whacked this kid.

28:18.046 --> 28:20.548
You should've waited.
That's the last time
i show initiative.

28:20.548 --> 28:23.051
Imagine how i felt?

28:23.051 --> 28:25.053
T's running down
the garbage business;

28:25.053 --> 28:27.055
i wet a guy to hold on
to one of our stops.

28:27.055 --> 28:31.426
He's not running
it down. It's getting
harder in new york.

28:32.427 --> 28:37.432
One, two, three!

28:37.432 --> 28:39.434
Come on!

28:39.684 --> 28:43.188
- This is fucked up.
- What, pussy?

28:43.188 --> 28:45.690
The kolar uncle is gonna
find the kid dead
in one of his bins...

28:45.690 --> 28:48.693
and get out of our
fuckin' business?

28:48.693 --> 28:51.196
No way.
"Louis brasi
sleeps with the fishes."

28:52.697 --> 28:56.201
- Luca brasi. Luca.
- Whatever.

28:56.201 --> 28:59.204
There's differences,
christopher, okay,

28:59.204 --> 29:02.207
from the luca brasi
situation and this.

29:04.209 --> 29:06.711
Look, the kolars
know the kid is dead,

29:06.711 --> 29:08.713
it hardens
their position.

29:08.713 --> 29:11.216
Plus, now, the cops
are looking
for a murderer.

29:11.716 --> 29:13.218
So, what do you wanna do?

29:13.718 --> 29:16.721
He disappears.
He never comes home.

29:16.721 --> 29:19.224
They know,
but they don't know.

29:19.224 --> 29:22.727
They hope maybe
he'll turn up...if.

29:22.727 --> 29:26.231
Yeah. Yeah.
Come on.
Let's get'im.

29:26.731 --> 29:29.734
Take'im
to staten island.
I'll cut'im up.

29:29.734 --> 29:31.736
All right.
Let's go.

29:32.237 --> 29:34.739
Pussy, you know,
t collapsing
at the birthday--

29:34.739 --> 29:38.743
what would you do
if he was disabled?

29:38.743 --> 29:40.995
Why would you
even ask that?

29:43.465 --> 29:45.467
Our lecture series
in action.

29:45.467 --> 29:50.472
It's someone from the university
discussing the novels
of zora neale hurston.

29:50.472 --> 29:52.974
Hmm!

29:52.974 --> 29:55.477
Didn't you just
read her in school, med?

29:56.478 --> 29:58.480
It's very nice.

30:03.985 --> 30:06.488
You know, grandma,
this place
is pretty neat.

30:06.488 --> 30:08.990
You should really
think about it.

30:09.491 --> 30:11.493
This room
was renovated last year.

30:11.993 --> 30:13.995
What goes on
behind there?

30:13.995 --> 30:16.998
Those doors lead
to our nursing unit.

30:18.116 --> 30:20.118
Thisis
a nursing home!

30:20.118 --> 30:22.120
This is a residence,
but just in case--

30:22.120 --> 30:26.124
no, you are not
getting me into--
you're not listening.

30:26.624 --> 30:30.128
You're not listening, ma.
I know these women
in their wheelchairs.

30:30.128 --> 30:32.630
Ma, you're not
listening.

30:32.630 --> 30:35.133
Ma.
You think
you're so high and mighty.

30:35.133 --> 30:37.635
With your fancy office.
Ma!

30:38.136 --> 30:41.139
Ma!
People come here
to die.

30:45.143 --> 30:47.645
Oh, my god!
Tony!

30:47.645 --> 30:50.899
Somebody get a doctor.
Dad!

30:57.789 --> 31:00.792
So, you've come back
for help.

31:01.292 --> 31:03.294
Don't look at that
as a defeat.

31:03.294 --> 31:05.797
She's part of
that generation that grew up
during the depression.

31:05.797 --> 31:08.299
But the depression to her
was a trip to six flags.

31:08.299 --> 31:11.302
There's that
"d" word again.

31:17.809 --> 31:19.310
Stay with your mother.

31:23.815 --> 31:28.319
Now that my father's dead,
he's a saint.

31:28.319 --> 31:31.322
When he was alive,
nothing.

31:35.777 --> 31:39.781
My dad was tough.
He ran his own crew.

31:39.781 --> 31:44.285
A guy like that,
and my mother wore him down
to a little nub.

31:44.285 --> 31:48.790
He was a squeaking
little gerbil when he died.

31:48.790 --> 31:52.794
Quite a formidable
maternal presence.

31:56.264 --> 31:58.266
I gotta be honest
with you, um,

31:58.266 --> 32:01.269
i'm not getting any satisfaction
from my work either.

32:01.269 --> 32:03.271
Why?

32:03.771 --> 32:08.276
- Well, because of rico.
- Is he your brother?

32:08.276 --> 32:11.779
- No, the rico statutes?
- Oh, of course.

32:11.779 --> 32:15.783
You read the papers?
The government's using
electronic surveillance...

32:15.783 --> 32:19.287
and various legal strategies
to squeeze my business.

32:22.240 --> 32:26.744
Do you have any qualms
about how you actually
make a living?

32:28.246 --> 32:29.747
Yeah.

32:32.250 --> 32:34.252
I find i have
to be the sad clown.

32:34.752 --> 32:37.255
Laughing on the outside,

32:37.755 --> 32:40.258
crying on the inside.

32:40.258 --> 32:43.761
See, things
are trending downward.

32:43.761 --> 32:46.764
Used to be a guy got pinched,
he took his prison jolt
no matter what.

32:46.764 --> 32:48.716
Everybody upheld
the code of silence.

32:48.716 --> 32:53.237
Nowadays, no values.

32:53.237 --> 32:56.741
Guys today have no room
for the penal experience.

32:56.741 --> 32:58.743
So everybody
turns government witness.

33:02.580 --> 33:05.583
I feel exhausted
just talking about it.

33:06.084 --> 33:07.585
Well,

33:08.086 --> 33:11.589
with today's pharmacology,
no one needs to suffer...

33:11.589 --> 33:15.593
with feelings of
exhaustion and depression.

33:15.593 --> 33:20.214
Here we go.
Here comes the prozac.

33:28.723 --> 33:31.976
Mahaffey does not
have the money.
What do you mean?

33:31.976 --> 33:34.479
- Mahaffey does not
have the money.
- How could he not?

33:34.479 --> 33:37.865
- The man does not
have the money.
- We ran the man over.

33:38.366 --> 33:41.486
- T himself.
- The man has no wiggle room.

33:41.486 --> 33:43.988
He's bled dry.

33:46.991 --> 33:49.994
So, uh,

33:49.994 --> 33:52.997
i hear that junior
wants to whack
pussy bompensiero.

33:52.997 --> 33:55.750
- Pussy malanga.
- Oh, little pussy.

33:56.134 --> 33:59.754
You think he's going to fuck
with big pussy? My pussy?

34:00.755 --> 34:03.257
Andrea.

34:04.258 --> 34:06.761
Stay with drinks on the house--
all night.

34:07.261 --> 34:09.263
Sorry, mr. Dante.
Sorry.

34:09.764 --> 34:11.766
So, uh...

34:13.266 --> 34:15.268
your uncle resents
that you're the boss.

34:15.268 --> 34:16.771
Sadness accrues.

34:17.271 --> 34:19.524
Your uncle's
had a hard- on
his whole life.

34:19.524 --> 34:22.527
First against
your father,
his younger brother,

34:22.527 --> 34:26.030
'cause he was a
made man before him,
and now you.

34:26.030 --> 34:30.534
So, sure,
he can't stomach your
telling him what to do.

34:30.534 --> 34:33.036
Hesh, i love the man.

34:33.170 --> 34:36.174
The man is driven,
in toto, by his insecurities.

34:36.541 --> 34:39.543
I feel bad i was the messenger.

34:41.545 --> 34:44.047
Your friend, artie,
with the restaurant,

34:44.297 --> 34:46.934
get him out of town
for three weeks.

34:46.934 --> 34:48.936
That way,
the restaurant closes,

34:48.936 --> 34:52.440
the hit has to go down
someplace else.

34:52.440 --> 34:56.944
You old fuckin' jew.
No wonder my old man
kept you around so long.

34:56.944 --> 35:00.448
What about this jew's 250
on mahaffey's 100?

35:04.452 --> 35:08.456
All right, mahaffey has
a new business partner: You.

35:09.957 --> 35:13.961
H. M. O. S pay out millions
to doctors, hospitals,
whatever the fuck.

35:13.961 --> 35:17.465
That m. R. I. I had,
$2, 000 a pop.

35:17.465 --> 35:21.469
Now, we
give this mahaffey a choice.
He either has his company...

35:21.469 --> 35:25.473
start payin' out phoney claims
to fake clinics we set up...

35:25.973 --> 35:29.477
or he pays hesh
the 250 grand he owes him--

35:29.477 --> 35:32.980
which we know
he cannot do--

35:34.982 --> 35:37.735
or it's a rainy night
in lyndhurst.

35:38.736 --> 35:41.739
Very smart.
Could be major.

35:41.739 --> 35:45.743
- Could be as good as garbage.
- Garbage is our bread
and butter.

35:46.244 --> 35:48.746
Was.

35:57.505 --> 36:01.008
Miss meadow!

36:04.011 --> 36:08.516
So, med.
I'm not going.

36:08.516 --> 36:12.520
Every year on this date
since you were itty- bitty,

36:12.520 --> 36:14.889
mom and meadow
get all dolled up,

36:14.889 --> 36:19.894
drive in to new york,
plaza hotel, for tea
under eloise's portrait.

36:19.894 --> 36:23.898
Look. Where's yours?
I have too much homework.

36:23.898 --> 36:27.902
It's our little tradition.
We always have so much fun.

36:27.902 --> 36:31.405
To tell you the truth,
i felt it was dumb
since i was eight.

36:31.405 --> 36:33.908
I just go
because you like it.

36:36.911 --> 36:39.413
And here i thought
this was something
we would do...

36:39.413 --> 36:43.918
long after you got married
with girls of your own.

36:44.051 --> 36:46.921
Hopefully i won't
be living here by then.

36:47.171 --> 36:49.173
You've got mail.

36:49.423 --> 36:54.929
Meadow, you can't just lie
and cheat and break the rules
you don't like!

36:57.932 --> 36:59.934
What? You have something
you want to say to me?

37:01.185 --> 37:03.187
Do you have any idea
how much it means...

37:03.688 --> 37:05.189
to go skiing in aspen?

37:05.690 --> 37:08.192
Do you think
that's gonna happen
every year,

37:08.326 --> 37:11.829
like lame tea and scones
at the plaza hotel?

37:11.829 --> 37:15.199
Good- bye.

37:15.199 --> 37:18.452
Close my door, please.

37:18.452 --> 37:21.455
Artie!
Okay, gimme a drop.

37:21.455 --> 37:24.458
Oh! A drop, not a spurt.
Suave, a drop.

37:24.959 --> 37:28.462
Artie. How are you?
Hey!
Stir the meatballs.

37:28.963 --> 37:31.465
I wonder if you can
help me out.
What do you need?

37:31.716 --> 37:35.720
Cruise, caribbean,
s. S. Sagafjord,
11th through the 29th.

37:35.720 --> 37:39.473
Pair of tickets.
I can't use'em.

37:39.473 --> 37:42.476
Can you take'em
off my hands?
Where'd they come from?

37:42.476 --> 37:45.112
- Comps.
- Comps?

37:45.112 --> 37:49.367
- What does that mean,
"comps"?
- As business manager...

37:49.367 --> 37:51.869
for the kitchen
the restaurant workers union,
i administer the dental plan.

37:51.869 --> 37:54.488
You listening to me?
Yeah.

37:54.488 --> 37:58.993
A couple of dentists got
together, and in appreciation,
they awarded me these tickets.

37:59.493 --> 38:01.495
Problem is,
i can't get away.

38:01.495 --> 38:04.999
Here.

38:04.999 --> 38:07.001
When's the last time
you got away?

38:07.001 --> 38:09.887
Anthony, thank you.
All right.

38:16.894 --> 38:18.896
Mr. Soprano.

38:26.654 --> 38:29.657
You cannot accept
a gift like that
from tony soprano.

38:29.657 --> 38:32.159
No way.
Listen, charmaine,

38:32.159 --> 38:35.663
if i gotta stick my hand
up the ass of one more lobster
without a break--

38:35.663 --> 38:39.667
i'm gonna go postal.
I don't even
want to talk about it.

38:39.667 --> 38:43.671
Art, melissa,
it's time to go home.

38:43.671 --> 38:46.674
Honey, you have
to get away.

38:46.674 --> 38:49.176
Wehave to get away
for the marriage.

38:49.176 --> 38:52.179
No! It's bad enough
that these mobsters...

38:52.179 --> 38:54.932
still come in
and patronize the place.

38:54.932 --> 38:59.553
- So what? We're not connected.
- Because we
turned down those tickets.

38:59.804 --> 39:03.307
But the tickets were comps.
Tony is a labor leader.

39:03.808 --> 39:05.309
Arthur,
please grow up!

39:05.810 --> 39:08.312
Does the mind
not rebel at
any scenario...

39:08.312 --> 39:12.316
under which dentists
are sending the don
of new jersey...

39:12.316 --> 39:14.318
first class
on a norwegian
steamship?

39:14.819 --> 39:18.322
Somebody donated
their kneecaps
for those tickets.

39:18.706 --> 39:21.208
Herman, there's no way
i can subvert...

39:21.208 --> 39:23.210
my fuckin' company.

39:23.210 --> 39:26.213
Have them
pay claims for m. R. I. S
that never happened?

39:26.213 --> 39:28.716
The paperwork
will look just
like the real.

39:28.716 --> 39:30.718
How do i not
get caught?

39:30.718 --> 39:32.720
I hate to hear you
knocking yourself.

39:33.220 --> 39:35.222
You're a smart guy.
I'm depressed.

39:35.222 --> 39:37.224
I'm so depressed
i can't eat, sleep.

39:37.224 --> 39:40.728
You on prozac?
Zoloft.
It's similar.

39:41.228 --> 39:43.230
It's supposed to help
with gambling too.
No shit?

39:43.230 --> 39:46.233
This new generation
of antidepressants...

39:46.233 --> 39:49.987
are supposed to be useful
against compulsive behaviors.

39:49.987 --> 39:51.989
That's a shame.
A medication comes along...

39:51.989 --> 39:54.992
after gambling gets
your fuckin' hip busted to shit.

39:55.493 --> 39:57.995
I'm trying
not to be cynical.

39:57.995 --> 40:00.998
Your debt and the feeling
surrounding it is the source
of your problems.

40:01.115 --> 40:04.869
You know it and i know it.
I'm sorry i haven't
paid you, herman.

40:04.869 --> 40:09.006
- I know you are.
- I never meant
to denigrate tony soprano.

40:09.006 --> 40:11.008
Hey, you wanna go
for a walk in the rocks?

40:11.008 --> 40:14.011
The crutches.
I can't--
come on.

40:14.011 --> 40:17.515
It's beautiful.
We'll help you.
I go out to think.

40:31.028 --> 40:33.531
Thanks, but no.

40:34.031 --> 40:36.534
Uh...let's try it--

40:36.534 --> 40:41.405
what you were sayin' before
with the m. R. I. S?

41:06.063 --> 41:08.432
Dick's lookin' for ya.

41:09.433 --> 41:12.937
Hey, tony. I just heard
from triboro towers.

41:12.937 --> 41:15.940
The kolar brothers
withdrew their bid.

41:15.940 --> 41:17.942
That's good.
That's good.

41:17.942 --> 41:20.945
Listen, by the way,
artie bucco's here to see you.

41:20.945 --> 41:22.947
I gotta go, guys.
Take care.

41:29.453 --> 41:32.957
Artie! Artie,
you all right?

41:35.960 --> 41:38.462
I can't.
What are you
talkin' about?

41:38.712 --> 41:42.716
- We discussed this.
You gotta leave town.
- I'm sorry.

41:49.857 --> 41:52.359
This is unacceptable!

41:52.359 --> 41:54.862
I had an 8:00 reservation
i made two weeks ago.

41:54.862 --> 41:57.865
Sir, as i explained,
people are not leaving
their tables,

41:57.865 --> 41:59.867
and there are five parties
ahead of you.

41:59.867 --> 42:03.370
What would you like--
can i help you?

42:03.370 --> 42:06.373
I tore her a new one.

42:06.373 --> 42:10.377
Why don't we go to
another restaurant
and eat?

42:10.377 --> 42:13.380
We're here.
Mr. Soprano, how you doin'?

42:13.631 --> 42:16.133
Giuseppe, how you doin'?

42:16.133 --> 42:19.637
Hey.
This way.

42:23.641 --> 42:26.644
Sweetie pie, i'm hungry.

42:26.644 --> 42:29.763
- Hey.
- Tony, where are you going?

42:29.763 --> 42:33.517
- Hey. How are you?
- Good.

42:33.517 --> 42:36.520
You come here?
When possible.

42:38.022 --> 42:42.776
Hey, uh, listen,
those decorating tips
you gave me really work.

42:42.776 --> 42:45.529
Good.

42:45.529 --> 42:47.531
How you doin'?

42:52.286 --> 42:54.288
Nils. Nils.

42:54.288 --> 42:57.291
Do you know
who that was?

42:57.291 --> 43:00.294
Obviously, you do.
Is he a patient?

43:00.294 --> 43:02.680
You know i can't say.

43:07.301 --> 43:09.303
Decorating tips--
yeah, right.

43:09.303 --> 43:11.305
Nils, shut the fuck up.

43:11.805 --> 43:15.059
Mr. Borglund, they're
setting up your table right now.

43:16.560 --> 43:18.946
Whoa.

43:18.946 --> 43:21.949
Who was that woman
tonight at the restaurant?

43:21.949 --> 43:23.867
My decorator.

43:23.867 --> 43:26.870
What? You're
redoing the garbage dump?
That's funny.

43:26.870 --> 43:29.373
Hey, you better not be
messin' with that hat!

43:32.376 --> 43:34.878
Goddamn! Come on!
That's j. F. K. 's hat!

43:35.379 --> 43:37.381
I bought it
at that auction.
Gimme that!

43:37.881 --> 43:40.384
Irina, jesus.

43:40.384 --> 43:44.888
I know there is something
more intimate
between you and her.

43:44.888 --> 43:46.890
Nothing intimate.
We just talk.

43:47.391 --> 43:49.393
Yeah.

43:57.017 --> 43:59.019
Mr. Soprano, buonasera.

43:59.019 --> 44:01.522
Months we don't see you.
Where you been?

44:01.522 --> 44:04.525
Signora carmela.

44:07.778 --> 44:12.416
You know, sometimes,
life is good.

44:12.416 --> 44:14.918
Life is often good.

44:15.419 --> 44:17.921
True regaliali,
for example.

44:19.923 --> 44:21.925
You been in good spirits
the last couple days.

44:30.934 --> 44:32.936
Carmela,

44:32.936 --> 44:34.938
something i gotta confess.

44:38.442 --> 44:42.946
What are you doing?
Getting my wine in position
to throw in your damn face.

44:42.946 --> 44:46.950
You're always with the drama.
You go ahead and confess
already. Get it over with.

44:51.455 --> 44:53.457
I'm on prozac.

44:53.457 --> 44:56.460
Oh. Oh, my god.

44:56.460 --> 44:59.963
I been seein' a therapist.
Oh, my god!

44:59.963 --> 45:02.966
I think that's great!
I think that's wonderful!

45:02.966 --> 45:04.968
I think that's
so gutsy!

45:05.469 --> 45:08.472
All right,
take it easy.
That's wonderful!

45:08.472 --> 45:10.974
You'd think i was
hannibal lecter before.

45:10.974 --> 45:13.477
I just think it's great.
Psychology doesn't
address the soul.

45:13.477 --> 45:17.481
That's something else.
But this is a start.
I'm gonna shut up now.

45:17.981 --> 45:21.485
I'll shut up now.
You're the only person
who knows.

45:21.985 --> 45:24.988
The only reason
i'm telling you this
is'cause you're my wife.

45:24.988 --> 45:27.991
You're the only person
on this planet
i'm totally honest with.

45:27.991 --> 45:32.496
Oh, please.
Goddamn it, i'm serious.

45:32.496 --> 45:36.500
Wrong person finds out, i get
a steel- jacketed antidepressant
in back of the head.

45:46.877 --> 45:49.880
I didn't realize
you were so unhappy.

45:53.383 --> 45:56.887
I don't know.
My mother--

45:57.271 --> 45:59.273
you told him
about your father, right?

45:59.273 --> 46:02.276
Who?
Your therapist.

46:02.276 --> 46:05.279
Yeah. Yeah, i told him.

46:05.279 --> 46:09.783
Oh, good. But your mother
is the one.

46:09.783 --> 46:14.788
I don't know.
I feel like lately
my life's out of balance.

46:18.292 --> 46:21.795
Our existence on this earth
is a puzzle.

46:22.296 --> 46:25.299
My own daughter hates me.

46:25.299 --> 46:27.801
She doesn't hate you, carm.

46:27.801 --> 46:30.304
We were best friends.
Mothers and their daughters.

46:30.804 --> 46:33.807
She'll come back to you.

46:36.310 --> 46:38.929
Hello?
Jesus, i got through.

46:38.929 --> 46:40.931
What's the matter,
no social life?

46:41.064 --> 46:42.566
Blow me.

46:43.066 --> 46:45.068
Dad!

46:45.068 --> 46:47.070
I brought you
my primavera.

46:47.070 --> 46:49.573
It's your favorite.

46:49.573 --> 46:53.076
Who is it?
Christopher.

46:53.327 --> 46:55.329
Friend of ours just got back.
Little pussy malanga,

46:55.329 --> 46:59.333
sometimes confused
with fellow mobster
big pussy bompensiero,

46:59.333 --> 47:01.335
had just returned
from florida--

47:01.335 --> 47:03.837
so it's gonna
go down soon?

47:03.837 --> 47:06.089
Don't worry about it.
I got a way
to put it to bed.

47:07.708 --> 47:10.210
Come on, meadow!

47:10.594 --> 47:12.596
Go falcons!

47:14.097 --> 47:16.099
So, uh, when do you
need this by?

47:16.099 --> 47:18.101
Right away.

47:18.101 --> 47:21.972
Way to go, meadow!
Beautiful. Beautiful.

47:21.972 --> 47:23.974
I think i can get a party
like that together.

47:24.474 --> 47:28.228
Side out? That ball
hit the line.
What are you doin', ref?

47:32.733 --> 47:36.236
Mom didn't come?
Didn't think
you wanted her to.

47:36.236 --> 47:38.238
Car's over there.

47:38.238 --> 47:40.240
Hey, mr. Dante.

47:40.240 --> 47:42.242
Hi.
See ya, heather.

47:42.242 --> 47:44.244
You guys
played a good game.

47:44.745 --> 47:46.246
That heather dante,
where'd she get
that spike?

47:46.747 --> 47:49.249
Dad, don't you think
it's unfair what mom is doing?

47:49.750 --> 47:51.752
Now making this
movie scene out of it.

47:51.752 --> 47:57.257
The sad mom who can't
come to her daughter's
sports events.

48:01.511 --> 48:03.513
Dad.

48:03.881 --> 48:08.101
Don't you think
it's totally out there?
My aspen trip.

48:08.101 --> 48:10.103
What is she thinking?

48:10.103 --> 48:12.322
Dad?

48:18.779 --> 48:21.281
It's been years
since i been here.

48:21.281 --> 48:24.034
Dad, please talk to her.
Please.

48:24.034 --> 48:27.037
This is so stupid.

48:27.037 --> 48:29.039
Why are we sitting here?

48:31.041 --> 48:33.543
Your mother thinks
you have the capacity
to be a top student,

48:33.543 --> 48:35.545
and i agree.

48:35.545 --> 48:38.548
What do you guys want,
perfection?

48:40.050 --> 48:42.552
What are you looking at?

48:42.552 --> 48:46.556
Your great- grandfather
and his brother frank,

48:46.556 --> 48:49.059
they built this place.

48:49.059 --> 48:51.061
Big whoop.

48:51.061 --> 48:54.564
Stone and marble workers.
They came over from italy...

48:54.564 --> 48:57.567
and they built this place.

48:58.068 --> 49:01.071
Yeah, right. Two guys.

49:01.455 --> 49:06.960
No, there were two guys
and a crew of laborers.

49:08.962 --> 49:11.465
They didn't design it...

49:12.466 --> 49:15.085
but they knew
how to build it.

49:17.471 --> 49:20.474
Go out now and find me two guys
who can put decent grout
around your bathtub.

49:57.377 --> 49:59.513
So i feel good.

49:59.513 --> 50:03.016
So i don't know if i'm
gonna be needing to come back.

50:03.016 --> 50:05.018
It's not the prozac.

50:05.502 --> 50:07.437
Why not?

50:07.437 --> 50:09.423
You said you're
thinking clearer...

50:09.423 --> 50:13.393
and your wife says
you seem to be better?

50:13.393 --> 50:15.896
It's not the medication.

50:16.897 --> 50:18.899
Prozac takes
several weeks...

50:18.899 --> 50:21.401
to build up effective levels
in the blood.

50:21.785 --> 50:24.287
What is it, then?

50:25.789 --> 50:27.791
Coming here. Talking.

50:29.292 --> 50:31.795
Hope comes in many forms.

50:31.795 --> 50:33.797
Well, who's got time
for that?

50:33.797 --> 50:36.800
What is it you want
to say to me?

50:46.226 --> 50:49.679
I had a dream last night.

50:51.314 --> 50:53.683
Uh...

50:53.683 --> 50:57.687
my bellybutton was...

50:57.687 --> 51:00.690
a phillips head screw.

51:00.690 --> 51:03.693
And i'm workin'
unscrewin' it,

51:03.693 --> 51:05.695
and when i get it
unscrewed...

51:07.831 --> 51:10.834
my penis falls off.

51:15.338 --> 51:19.342
You know, i pick it up.
And i'm holdin' it
and i'm runnin' around...

51:19.342 --> 51:21.344
lookin' for the guy who used to
work on my lincoln--

51:21.344 --> 51:25.348
when i drove lincolns--
so he can put it back on.

51:25.348 --> 51:27.851
And...

51:27.851 --> 51:30.854
i'm holdin' it up,
and this bird swoops down...

51:30.854 --> 51:33.857
and grabs it in its beak...

51:33.857 --> 51:36.359
and flies off with it.

51:38.061 --> 51:41.531
- What kind of bird? -

51:43.533 --> 51:46.036
i don't know.
Seagull or something.

51:46.036 --> 51:48.789
A water bird?

51:48.789 --> 51:51.291
I sawthe birds
last week on cable.

51:51.291 --> 51:54.294
You think
that planted the idea?
What else is a water bird?

51:55.295 --> 51:57.798
Pelican. Flamingo.

51:58.298 --> 52:00.550
What about ducks?

52:07.007 --> 52:09.509
Those goddamned ducks.

52:09.509 --> 52:12.145
What is it about those ducks
that meant so much to you?

52:18.568 --> 52:23.073
It was just a trip
havin' those...

52:23.073 --> 52:26.076
wild creatures come...

52:26.576 --> 52:29.579
into my pool and have
their little babies.

52:36.586 --> 52:40.090
I was sad to see'em go.

52:40.090 --> 52:44.594
Aw, jesus! Fuck!
Now he's gonna cry.

52:50.600 --> 52:53.553
Shit. Fuck me.

52:53.553 --> 52:55.555
When the ducks
gave birth...

52:56.056 --> 52:59.809
to those babies,
it became a family.

53:03.813 --> 53:05.815
You're right.

53:06.316 --> 53:08.952
That's the link.
The connection.

53:08.952 --> 53:12.455
I'm afraid i'm gonna
lose my family...

53:12.455 --> 53:15.458
like i lost the ducks.

53:16.826 --> 53:19.045
That's what i'm full
of dread about.

53:22.048 --> 53:26.169
- That's always with me.
- What are you so afraid's
going to happen?

53:27.170 --> 53:30.140
I don't know.

53:34.010 --> 53:38.014
You work so hard.
You work so damn hard.

53:38.014 --> 53:41.518
And to see
your life's dream...

53:41.518 --> 53:44.521
burn down.

53:44.521 --> 53:47.524
Look at it this way.
You collect the insurance.

53:47.908 --> 53:49.409
Arthur, you gotta
say to yourself, it
could've been worse.

53:49.910 --> 53:51.411
Yeah.
How could it
have been worse?

53:51.912 --> 53:54.915
Fuckin' faulty stove!

53:55.415 --> 53:57.918
Suppose people stop coming
to the restaurant?

53:59.286 --> 54:02.172
I don't know.
I don't know what the fuck.

54:03.673 --> 54:06.676
He's right about that.
There's no insurance for that.

54:06.676 --> 54:09.179
But why would people
stop coming?

54:09.179 --> 54:11.681
It's just starting
to catch on.

54:12.682 --> 54:15.685
Know what i'm
figuring out lately?

54:15.685 --> 54:17.687
Talking helps.

54:17.687 --> 54:20.690
- That's right.
- He's right.

54:23.693 --> 54:28.949
- Hope comes in many forms.
- Absolutely.

54:29.199 --> 54:31.568
Come on.

54:31.568 --> 54:34.070
Oh, geez.
Here, hold this.

54:34.070 --> 54:37.073
Artie. Artie, come on.

54:37.073 --> 54:39.075
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.

54:39.075 --> 54:41.077
Hey, look at me.
Look at me.

54:42.579 --> 54:44.581
I'll always help you.

54:44.581 --> 54:48.084
Come on. Come on.

54:51.471 --> 54:55.342
Go cook. Let'im cook.
He'll feel better.

55:06.853 --> 55:09.856
Someday i'll tell him
we torched the restaurant...

55:09.856 --> 55:12.242
as the best solution.

55:15.612 --> 55:17.614
Enough of this shit.

55:17.864 --> 55:19.833
What's wrong with you?

55:20.834 --> 55:23.336
You know, a simple
"way to go, chris"...

55:23.336 --> 55:28.091
on the triboro towers
contract would've been nice.

55:37.217 --> 55:40.470
You're right.
You're right.

55:40.470 --> 55:45.975
I have no defense.
That's howiwas parented,
never supported.

55:45.975 --> 55:48.728
Never complimented.

55:48.728 --> 55:51.731
You know, my cousin gregory's
girlfriend is what they call...

55:52.232 --> 55:54.234
a development girl
out in hollywood.

55:54.617 --> 55:57.120
She said i could sell
my life story-- make millions.

55:57.620 --> 55:59.489
I didn't do that.
I stuck it out with you--

55:59.489 --> 56:01.624
come here. I could
fuckin' kill you.

56:02.125 --> 56:04.127
What are you gonna do,
go henry hill on me?

56:04.127 --> 56:07.630
You know how many mobsters
are selling screenplays,
screwing everything up?

56:07.630 --> 56:09.632
She said i could maybe
even play myself.

56:09.632 --> 56:12.135
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

56:15.138 --> 56:17.640
Forget hollywood
screenplays.

56:17.640 --> 56:19.642
Forget
those distractions.

56:19.642 --> 56:23.146
What do you think,
i haven't had offers?

56:25.648 --> 56:28.151
You got work to do.
New avenues.

56:28.151 --> 56:30.653
Everything's
gonna be all right
from here on in.

56:31.154 --> 56:33.156
Come on.

56:33.156 --> 56:35.158
Look, it's
a beautiful day.

56:35.158 --> 56:37.777
What could be bad?

56:39.779 --> 56:43.783
It's nice of you to pick me up
for the party, junior.

56:43.783 --> 56:47.036
At least somebody
cares about me.

56:47.036 --> 56:50.540
These kids today.
I suppose he thinks...

56:50.790 --> 56:53.293
once he has me locked
in a nursing home,
i'll die faster.

56:53.793 --> 56:56.296
And then he won't
have to drive me anywhere.

56:56.679 --> 57:00.683
If his father
were still alive,

57:00.934 --> 57:03.937
he'd show more decency
and respect for his mother.

57:03.937 --> 57:07.440
My brother john
was a man among men.

57:07.941 --> 57:09.943
He was a saint.

57:10.310 --> 57:13.813
Anyway, lots of things
are different now
from johnny's and my day.

57:14.314 --> 57:15.815
What do you mean?

57:16.316 --> 57:19.819
I'm not free to run
my business like i want.
Isn't that awful.

57:19.953 --> 57:21.955
Just this week,
your son stuck his hand in.

57:21.955 --> 57:24.457
Made it a hundred times
more difficult for me.

57:24.457 --> 57:28.461
- Plus, he thumbs his nose
at new york.
- Oh!

57:28.461 --> 57:31.965
What are you going to do?
He's part of a whole generation.

57:31.965 --> 57:33.967
Remember the crazy hair?

57:33.967 --> 57:36.469
And the dope.
Now it's fags in the military.

57:36.719 --> 57:39.722
Stop it, junior!
You're makin' me very upset!

57:39.722 --> 57:42.225
I don't like to, livia,
but i'm allagita
all the time.

57:42.225 --> 57:44.227
I'll tell you
something else,

57:44.594 --> 57:47.096
things are down
across the board.

57:47.096 --> 57:51.100
A lot of friends
of ours
are complaining.

57:51.100 --> 57:53.603
We used to be recession- proof.
No more.

57:53.603 --> 57:57.607
You can't blame it all
on the justice department.

57:58.107 --> 58:00.610
Our friends say to me,

58:00.610 --> 58:04.614
"junior, why don't you take
a larger hand in things?"

58:08.618 --> 58:12.005
Something may have to be done,
livia, about tony.

58:13.006 --> 58:15.008
I don't know.

58:21.764 --> 58:23.766
There they are.
Hey, ma! Uncle jun'!

58:23.766 --> 58:25.768
You're using mesquite.

58:25.768 --> 58:28.771
That makes
the sausage
taste peculiar.

58:28.771 --> 58:31.774
Hi, grandma.
Happy birthday,
my big boy.

58:31.774 --> 58:33.776
Carmela, my mother's here.

58:33.776 --> 58:36.779
Everybody, let's eat!

58:50.793 --> 58:54.297
Hey, meadow,
i'm not going to eat, are you?
