About the specific situation, I…

05:24.700 --> 05:27.710

So he got you out of the hospital first

07:50.480 --> 07:51.880
The nurse said Professor Cha went to a far place.

07:51.880 --> 07:53.890
Then the boy blamed himself so much.

It's not an easy operation.

14:09.590 --> 14:10.660
I know.

14:10.660 --> 14:13.360
Which one of my surgeries is easy?

14:13.360 --> 14:14.870
That's why Professor Cha's gonna do it.

14:14.870 --> 14:16.000
After all, it's a difficult surgery.

14:16.000 --> 14:16.700
You brat.

14:16.700 --> 14:19.270
But I'm sure you can handle it.

14:19.270 --> 14:21.370
You've done a good job with your surgeries.

14:23.710 --> 14:25.610
The patient had Kawasaki disease.

14:23.940 --> 14:25.980
[Kawasaki disease: an acute vasculitis appearing in infant period]

14:25.610 --> 14:26.210
What?

14:26.210 --> 14:27.550
Right.

14:27.550 --> 14:29.110
He had Kawasaki disease

14:29.110 --> 14:30.350
when he was four.

14:30.350 --> 14:31.380
You didn't know that?

14:31.380 --> 14:32.280
You didn't know that?

14:32.280 --> 14:33.780
It seems you don't know that.

14:34.390 --> 14:35.390
It...

14:35.390 --> 14:38.860
It... It is a disease that causes high fever and inflammation.

14:38.860 --> 14:40.660
It's mostly for three- and four-year-old children.

14:40.660 --> 14:42.860
It can also lead to fatal complications.

14:43.560 --> 14:47.030
Right, coronary artery aneurysm.

14:46.960 --> 14:49.100
[Coronary artery aneurysm]

14:47.030 --> 14:49.000
Coronary artery aneurysm.

14:49.530 --> 14:51.040
Once the coronary artery expands,

14:51.040 --> 14:52.970
the blood will stay in place and form a clot,

14:52.970 --> 14:55.640
which can cause an acute myocardial infarction.

14:55.640 --> 14:57.070
So, we have to deal with that.

14:57.070 --> 14:58.580
We need a CABG.

14:57.170 --> 14:59.310
[CABG coronary artery bypass graft]

14:58.580 --> 15:01.110
So, we need a CABG.

15:03.180 --> 15:06.520
Why just pick one or two words?

15:06.520 --> 15:07.720
Well, you do know that.

15:07.720 --> 15:09.450
Replacement of the right ventricular catheter is a common surgery.

15:09.450 --> 15:11.020
The hard part is having to do a CABG at the same time.

15:11.020 --> 15:13.860
Not to mention the patient is a child.

15:13.860 --> 15:16.230
Yeah, there's got to be an internal mammary artery underneath the bone.

15:16.230 --> 15:17.560
If adhesions occur,

15:17.560 --> 15:19.760
it's very difficult to just peel them off.

15:19.760 --> 15:23.570
It's gonna be very hard just to peel off the internal mammary artery underneath the bone.

15:24.270 --> 15:26.870
The catheter is also stuck to the chest, making it difficult to peel off.

15:26.870 --> 15:29.040
The adhesions are severe, and the internal mammary artery is difficult to peel off.

15:29.040 --> 15:32.540
The left anterior descending coronary artery is difficult to locate due to adhesions.

15:32.540 --> 15:35.280
It's a far cry from the normal CABG.

15:35.280 --> 15:38.050
Not to mention, my surgery is already more difficult due to adhesions.

15:38.050 --> 15:39.280
He is a little boy,

15:39.280 --> 15:41.650
and opening his chest is a huge problem.

15:41.650 --> 15:43.220
It's extremely sensitive from the incision stage

15:41.790 --> 15:43.350
[Incision]

15:43.220 --> 15:45.090
and needs to be done carefully.

15:45.090 --> 15:47.020
We can't open his chest like we usually do.

15:47.020 --> 15:48.290
If we're not careful,

15:48.930 --> 15:51.860
the patient's life could be at risk before the thoracotomy.

15:53.130 --> 15:56.070
Well, the chest tube is stuck to the wall of tube.

15:56.730 --> 15:59.140
Hey, what are you saying?

15:59.140 --> 16:01.070
It's the wall of tube sticking to the chest tube.

16:01.070 --> 16:03.070
If something goes wrong with the peeling, before the chest is opened...

16:03.070 --> 16:04.710
How can you peel off and open the chest at the same time?

16:04.710 --> 16:06.610
Open the chest first and peel off.

16:06.610 --> 16:07.950
So, to open the chest, we have to go straight...

16:07.950 --> 16:09.550
Hey, what are you talking about? Are you crazy?

16:09.550 --> 16:12.280
I said we need to do it slowly and carefully.

16:12.280 --> 16:15.020
After peeling off, the left anterior artery…

16:15.020 --> 16:16.620
Oh my god.

16:16.620 --> 16:17.560
Seung Tak.

16:17.560 --> 16:20.690
It's left anterior descending coronary artery, Seung Tak.

16:20.690 --> 16:22.630
Left anterior descending coronary artery.

16:24.860 --> 16:26.860
-So I mean… -I mean…

16:30.130 --> 16:31.470
Where did he go?

16:34.540 --> 16:35.540
Ah.

16:39.510 --> 16:40.850
Who?

16:44.880 --> 16:47.020
Why did you say so much at once?

16:47.020 --> 16:49.150
You need to keep it short.

16:49.790 --> 16:51.860
You brat.

16:51.860 --> 16:55.490
Why are you mad at me when you can't keep up?

16:55.490 --> 16:56.730
You…

16:56.730 --> 16:59.930
Why didn't you tell me about Kawasaki disease in advance?

16:59.930 --> 17:02.530
That's something you need to figure out in advance.

17:02.530 --> 17:03.930
If you look at the patient history, you'd know that.

17:03.930 --> 17:05.770
I told you that you're not allowed to possess me randomly.

17:05.770 --> 17:08.140
Well, technically, it's both our fault.

17:11.210 --> 17:12.280
What?

17:12.910 --> 17:14.480
What are you doing here?

17:15.810 --> 17:17.109
Well.

17:17.109 --> 17:19.380
How could you just walk in here?

17:19.380 --> 17:21.349
Don't you have to knock on the door?

17:21.349 --> 17:23.650
You are so rude.

17:25.060 --> 17:27.359
I can't believe it's such a bad cooperation.

17:27.359 --> 17:28.590
What's wrong?

17:28.590 --> 17:31.330
I don't know what you are thinking.

17:31.330 --> 17:33.000
But I can't do the surgery.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.100
Don't give them meaningless hope.

17:35.100 --> 17:36.730
Help them get discharged.

17:37.540 --> 17:39.170
I heard that Professor Cha Yeong Min

17:39.740 --> 17:42.440
performed this surgery two years ago.

17:44.180 --> 17:46.340
You were his first assistant.

17:49.380 --> 17:52.750
It's the kind of surgery that a surgeon might not be able to perform once in a lifetime.

17:52.750 --> 17:54.190
It's a rare case.

17:54.190 --> 17:57.050
It's the kind of surgery that a surgeon might not be able to perform once in a lifetime.

17:57.050 --> 17:58.260
It's a rare case.

17:58.260 --> 18:01.230
I succeeded in doing such a difficult operation, the first in Korea.

18:01.230 --> 18:03.260
You were part of that historic moment.

18:03.260 --> 18:04.800
You saw and learned.

18:04.800 --> 18:05.900
You work harder than anyone else.

18:05.900 --> 18:07.160
And you are closer than anyone else.

18:07.160 --> 18:09.770
I know you've been in my shadow for a long time.

18:09.770 --> 18:11.170
After all, you've been working for me,

18:11.170 --> 18:14.240
and you've had fewer opportunities than other doctors in your class.

18:14.240 --> 18:16.540
You're going to be a professor soon.

18:16.540 --> 18:18.410
It's the perfect way to

18:18.410 --> 18:20.440
make up for a cardiac tamponade that went wrong.

18:23.380 --> 18:24.450
Will it work?

18:24.450 --> 18:26.750
I am well aware of his situation.

18:26.750 --> 18:28.250
Don't talk.

18:28.250 --> 18:29.350
It will work.

18:29.990 --> 18:33.660
You said I wasn't qualified to treat patients.

18:50.340 --> 18:52.340
You did everything you could.

18:53.480 --> 18:55.550
It's a bit of a stretch from the start.

18:56.180 --> 18:58.650
Don't be too disappointed if you don't succeed in the end.

18:59.180 --> 19:00.680
Is Seung Jo

19:00.680 --> 19:02.320
my patient?

19:03.190 --> 19:04.220
What?

19:05.490 --> 19:08.990
There's nothing good about attending physician

19:08.990 --> 19:11.160
who wears a white coat all the time.

19:12.100 --> 19:15.130
Hey, I heard you don't have a dad.

19:15.130 --> 19:17.230
I heard you and your mom live together.

19:17.230 --> 19:19.770
My mom said

19:19.770 --> 19:22.940
you were the reason your dad ran away from your mom.

19:22.940 --> 19:24.110
Right.

19:24.110 --> 19:26.210
You have no money for treatment.

19:26.210 --> 19:28.650
Your mom can't stop crying.

19:29.550 --> 19:31.050

19:33.420 --> 19:36.020
You are still not good even in hospital.

19:42.190 --> 19:44.200
I'm Cha Yeong Min.

19:44.200 --> 19:46.330
I'm the best doctor in this hospital.

19:46.330 --> 19:50.770
Do you have an attending physician like me?

19:51.570 --> 19:52.670
You don't, right?

19:52.670 --> 19:54.070
But he does.

19:54.070 --> 19:55.740
Seung Jo is my patient.

19:55.740 --> 19:57.140
If you want to ridicule him, you have to think about it.

19:57.140 --> 19:58.440
Do you understand?

19:59.940 --> 20:01.210
Do you understand?

20:51.060 --> 20:52.930

20:52.930 --> 20:55.200
I'm afraid the patient hit his chest because the place where he fell was sharp.

20:55.200 --> 20:55.830
This way.

20:55.830 --> 20:57.370
What is the patient's state of consciousness?

21:04.410 --> 21:06.640
That's the most important part.

21:06.640 --> 21:07.980
If possession is necessary,

21:07.980 --> 21:10.950
it must be done by mutual consent.

21:12.250 --> 21:14.050
and possess me.

Well,

let's just use hand signals.

23:27.580 --> 23:30.020
Well, you made things like this.

I can't believe you're telling me that.

when you had it.

What's the matter?

24:20.670 --> 24:22.970
You should be thankful that you're in the operating room now.

24:22.970 --> 24:23.770
If you behave like this again,

24:23.770 --> 24:27.280
-I wonder if it would be inappropriate.
-Can't you hear me?

24:30.310 --> 24:31.780
Hey, brother.

24:31.780 --> 24:32.950
Pay attention to his blood pressure.

24:32.950 --> 24:35.090
Could you?

24:36.520 --> 24:37.290
What?

24:37.290 --> 24:40.520
Even so, you can't tell him the location.

24:40.520 --> 24:41.890
What's going on?

24:41.890 --> 24:43.460
The patient who was sent here just now.

24:43.460 --> 24:44.730
I don't know if she's his mistress.

24:44.730 --> 24:46.460
She said her husband is on his way here.

24:46.460 --> 24:47.460
Why does her husband come here?

24:47.460 --> 24:48.900
She said he was coming to kill the patient.

24:48.900 --> 24:49.600
What?

24:49.600 --> 24:50.930
She also said he was going to kill you together.

24:50.930 --> 24:51.640
What?!

24:51.640 --> 24:52.900
That man is a member of the underworld.

24:52.900 --> 24:55.540
He just made a scene in the Emergency Room.

24:55.540 --> 24:57.310
Contact Security Room now.

24:57.310 --> 24:58.980
I have.

24:58.980 --> 24:59.480
Doctor Go…

24:59.480 --> 25:01.980
You can't walk away like this.

25:14.190 --> 25:16.060
Seung Tak.

25:16.060 --> 25:19.630
So, you're the doctor who saved that guy's life.

25:19.630 --> 25:21.730
Do you know me?

25:21.730 --> 25:24.000
You jerk!

25:26.540 --> 25:28.240
Let go of me!

25:28.240 --> 25:30.340
That jerk…

25:30.340 --> 25:33.180
Let go! Let go of me!

25:33.180 --> 25:35.580
I'm gonna kill that guy.

25:35.580 --> 25:36.550
Do you know how much my watch is worth?

25:36.550 --> 25:38.550
Let go of me!

25:38.550 --> 25:41.150
Our cooperation ends here.

25:42.120 --> 25:42.990
That's what I want to say.

25:42.990 --> 25:46.990
It's expensive. Please stop.

25:55.330 --> 25:58.740
Sort all of Dr. Go's surveillance videos every day

25:59.200 --> 26:01.810
and hand it to me.

26:01.810 --> 26:03.510
What?

26:03.510 --> 26:05.710
Every day?

26:14.150 --> 26:18.620
Who broke his promise first?

26:18.620 --> 26:21.220
You said we should negotiate.

26:21.220 --> 26:22.560
He pulled my hair, too.

26:22.560 --> 26:23.890
Just here.

26:23.890 --> 26:24.600
Well,

26:24.600 --> 26:25.600
it's your hair.

26:25.600 --> 26:26.260
Anyway,

26:26.260 --> 26:27.160
I did you a favor once.

26:27.160 --> 26:29.500
You're gonna do me a favor.

26:29.500 --> 26:30.770
You have made countless requests.

26:30.770 --> 26:32.170
I only made one.

26:32.170 --> 26:34.740
Help me uncover the truth.

26:36.040 --> 26:37.640
How can you be so stingy? You just got beaten up.

26:37.640 --> 26:39.510
Are you serious?

26:42.150 --> 26:43.010
Hello, brother.

26:43.010 --> 26:44.650
What's the matter?

26:45.250 --> 26:46.750
Really?

26:50.650 --> 26:53.620
They told me I will undergo an operation tomorrow.

26:54.630 --> 26:56.260
Will you?

26:56.260 --> 26:59.430
The operation is tentatively scheduled at 8:30 tomorrow morning.

26:59.430 --> 27:02.030
Do some preoperative examinations today.

27:02.030 --> 27:04.870
He should fast after midnight.

27:04.870 --> 27:06.640
Okay, I see.

27:06.640 --> 27:09.540
Check to see if the indicators of the liver continue to drop.

27:09.540 --> 27:12.210
Keep an eye on the heart condition.

27:12.210 --> 27:14.780
Okay, Doctor An.

27:25.590 --> 27:27.790
You persuaded An Tae Hyeon to have the operation,

27:27.790 --> 27:30.690
and you'll also be in the operating room.

27:30.690 --> 27:31.630
And then?

27:31.630 --> 27:33.730
And then you will volunteer

27:33.730 --> 27:35.730
to walk into the operating room.

27:35.730 --> 27:38.570
Go Seung Tak was acting wildly.

27:38.570 --> 27:41.910
Does he think of himself as a hero?

27:43.310 --> 27:46.280
It's all because someone always screws things up,

27:46.280 --> 27:49.050
so that he can have the chance to show off.

27:49.050 --> 27:50.080
I'm sorry.

27:50.080 --> 27:53.820
Dr. An, are you having a sudden ambition?

27:53.820 --> 27:54.950
I didn't ask you to operate,

27:54.950 --> 27:57.520
but you volunteered to do it.

27:58.020 --> 28:01.630
Or are you suddenly craving for being appointed as a professor?

28:01.630 --> 28:05.530
I'm gonna have to find a way for myself.

28:06.030 --> 28:09.300
I'm already in the position of betraying my teacher.

28:09.830 --> 28:12.200
What else do I have to lose?

28:14.540 --> 28:18.180
Since you want to contribute to the hospital,

28:18.180 --> 28:19.610
I appreciate that.

28:19.610 --> 28:22.180
This way I can speak for you.

28:23.450 --> 28:25.480
By the way,

28:25.480 --> 28:29.150
is there anything wrong with President Jang?

28:29.820 --> 28:32.660
Is something bothering you?

28:36.060 --> 28:37.460
Nothing.

28:38.130 --> 28:40.400
Just do as you always do.

28:40.930 --> 28:41.870
Pay extra attention to security.

28:41.870 --> 28:44.300
Don't leak any information out.

28:44.300 --> 28:46.500
Especially to the media.

28:46.500 --> 28:50.540
Good luck with your operation tomorrow.

28:50.540 --> 28:52.410
Fine, thank you.

29:01.920 --> 29:04.250
It would be better if the operation fails.

29:06.120 --> 29:07.060
Professor Cha, what are we doing here?

29:07.060 --> 29:08.330
To your room?

29:08.330 --> 29:08.860
No.

29:08.860 --> 29:09.490
I have to go somewhere.

29:09.490 --> 29:12.000
I beg you.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.730
Please help my brother.

29:14.730 --> 29:17.000
I'll find a way to pay for the medical bills.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.840
You should discuss this with the General Affairs Department.

29:19.840 --> 29:21.170
You're putting us in a very difficult position here.

29:21.170 --> 29:23.510
No one in the General Affairs Department wants to talk to me.

29:23.510 --> 29:28.280
Please! I'm begging you.

29:30.450 --> 29:32.180
Please.

29:34.520 --> 29:36.420
That's my sister.

29:44.290 --> 29:46.860
Please stop crying.

29:49.800 --> 29:51.870
Both our parents passed away.

29:51.870 --> 29:54.670
My sister and I relied on each other.

29:56.310 --> 29:59.240
My sister is a senior in high school with good grades.

29:59.980 --> 30:02.410
I was determined to pay for her college education.

30:00.000 --> 30:30.000
[Translated by iQIYI]

30:03.980 --> 30:06.480
But I still haven't saved enough money for her tuition.

30:12.220 --> 30:15.460
So, I started delivering late-night takeout a few months ago.

30:16.630 --> 30:18.130
Maybe because of overwork,

30:18.130 --> 30:20.630
my health suddenly began to deteriorate.

30:22.600 --> 30:25.900
I got some pills at the drugstore,

30:25.900 --> 30:28.810
instead of going to the hospital.

30:29.470 --> 30:32.040
That day I took strong medicine with an empty stomach.

30:32.710 --> 30:36.080
It made me muddleheaded.

30:37.450 --> 30:38.820
As a result…

31:06.080 --> 31:07.680
At the beginning,

31:07.680 --> 31:10.550
I was glad I was sent to this hospital.

31:11.650 --> 31:13.480
But no one came.

31:14.020 --> 31:16.420
No one took the responsibility for me.

31:16.420 --> 31:18.990
The hospital expenses must be very high…

31:22.730 --> 31:25.130
Doctor Cha, I beg you to help me.

31:26.860 --> 31:29.030
If you save me,

31:29.030 --> 31:31.530
I will tell the whole truth.

31:31.530 --> 31:34.640
I will take all the blame I should take.

31:35.440 --> 31:37.270
I can't leave my sister alone...

31:37.270 --> 31:39.710
I can't just leave like this.

31:39.710 --> 31:42.810
I'm begging you, Doctor Cha.

31:42.810 --> 31:44.750
Dr. Go Seung Tak.

31:48.650 --> 31:50.450
Please.

31:54.490 --> 31:56.060
What are you doing here?

31:58.460 --> 31:59.560
What brings you here?

31:59.560 --> 32:01.330
What can I do for you?

32:06.900 --> 32:10.570
I'm here to check on the patients.

32:10.570 --> 32:11.940
And seize the chance to sneak off…

32:11.940 --> 32:13.540
Play mobile games.

32:13.540 --> 32:15.310
Then I'm going.

32:19.780 --> 32:20.950
This guy is the culprit

32:20.950 --> 32:23.720
who made all of this happen.

32:24.250 --> 32:26.390
He also has a doctor working for him.

32:31.290 --> 32:33.130
At that time,

32:33.130 --> 32:35.430
someone knocked on my door...

32:45.710 --> 32:48.550
President Jang is now in extreme trouble physically.

32:48.550 --> 32:51.980
Maybe he didn't want you to see his current conditions.

32:51.980 --> 32:55.720
He rejected all visitors, except his son.

32:56.350 --> 32:58.290
And President Jang is in a very low mood.

32:58.290 --> 33:01.930
I specifically asked a neurologist to take extra care of him.

33:01.930 --> 33:04.160
Don't worry too much about it.

33:04.160 --> 33:06.230
I think President Jang will see you soon.

33:06.230 --> 33:08.160
I see.

33:08.670 --> 33:12.040
You are so sweet.

33:13.440 --> 33:17.770
Seems like you have been staying in the hospital lately.

33:17.770 --> 33:19.280
If you don't mind,

33:19.280 --> 33:22.450
let's go out and have a bite to eat.

33:22.450 --> 33:23.380
I have to work late tonight, too.

33:23.380 --> 33:25.920
You jerk! What tricks are you playing?

33:25.920 --> 33:28.080
Thank you for your kindness. Maybe next time.

33:28.080 --> 33:30.450
I'm a little tired today.

33:33.020 --> 33:35.330
Fine. Then,

33:35.330 --> 33:37.690
give me a chance next time.

33:58.980 --> 34:01.820
If you want to support the medical workers here,

34:01.820 --> 34:06.090
you need to know what's going on in every corner of the hospital.

34:06.090 --> 34:10.230
Start at the bottom.

34:19.639 --> 34:21.639
Really?

34:21.639 --> 34:23.270
I'm kidding.

34:23.270 --> 34:25.940
Isn't it?

34:26.610 --> 34:29.080
Yeah, yeah.

34:32.780 --> 34:35.389
Come on. Patients are not animals.

34:35.389 --> 34:37.420
How could they be forced to leave because of failure to pay hospital expenses on time?

34:37.420 --> 34:38.690
Does this make sense?

34:38.690 --> 34:40.190
It's not a big deal.

34:40.190 --> 34:41.590
Take it out of my salary.

34:41.590 --> 34:42.889
How much do you make as an intern?

34:42.889 --> 34:44.190
And you ask us to do it every time.

34:44.190 --> 34:45.900
What do you eat?

34:45.900 --> 34:47.929
I don't have time to eat, anyway.

34:47.929 --> 34:50.000
It's better than being criticized by patients.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.239
Just do it.

34:52.239 --> 34:54.400
I have some money left over.

34:59.610 --> 35:00.840
Oh.

35:02.580 --> 35:04.680
Thanks to you, I have money left over from next month's salary.

35:04.680 --> 35:05.650
I bought it with that money.

35:05.650 --> 35:07.880
The patient can pay the expenses in 12 installments.

35:07.880 --> 35:09.920
Thank you.

35:09.920 --> 35:10.650
Well…

35:10.650 --> 35:12.220
Yeah?

35:13.020 --> 35:15.960
You have grains of rice in your hair.

35:18.530 --> 35:21.200
Uh, I just got them at lunch.

35:24.500 --> 35:26.170
I'm so hungry.

35:29.440 --> 35:32.080
What a sweet person.

35:32.580 --> 35:34.380
You will be in luck.

35:34.380 --> 35:36.180
Thank you.

36:38.810 --> 36:40.040
Yeah, what's up?

36:40.040 --> 36:41.340
If it isn't an emergency, you and Dr. Lee Seon Ho...

36:41.340 --> 36:43.780
Hey! Hey!

36:43.780 --> 36:45.450
Doctors, please be quick.

36:45.450 --> 36:47.080
What's the matter?

36:47.080 --> 36:48.950
Hey! Go Seung Tak?

36:51.690 --> 36:53.490
Ah.

36:52.690 --> 36:56.490
[To be played in 60 seconds]

37:12.210 --> 37:14.740
Dr. An Tae Hyeon had an emergency in the Emergency Room.

37:14.740 --> 37:16.410
So, I came in his place.

37:16.980 --> 37:19.680
I seldom accept such a request.

37:21.020 --> 37:24.050
Give an injection and monitor the symptoms three times a day, right?

37:27.290 --> 37:30.890
That guy is so honest.

37:30.890 --> 37:35.000
He comes here four times every day without a single slip.

37:42.240 --> 37:43.640
Let me see.

37:43.640 --> 37:46.780
This is adrenaline. It's a cardiac stimulant.

37:46.780 --> 37:49.350
Furosemide. It's a diuretic.

37:49.350 --> 37:51.410
Just say you have to monitor the patient.

37:51.410 --> 37:53.820
He exhorted me repeatedly to monitor the patient.

37:53.820 --> 37:55.150
You know what?

37:55.150 --> 37:58.620
The dosage should be adjusted according to blood pressure and urine volume.

37:58.620 --> 38:02.330
7 microliters of adrenaline was injected per hour before.

38:02.960 --> 38:06.630
7 microliters of adrenaline was injected per hour before.

38:06.630 --> 38:09.130
So, what is it now?

38:09.130 --> 38:11.400
If I can't inject it on time,

38:11.400 --> 38:14.540
President Jang may have a cardiac arrest or heartbleed.

38:14.540 --> 38:16.110
Or,

38:16.110 --> 38:19.110
he may open his eyes suddenly.

38:19.110 --> 38:20.810
What?

38:20.810 --> 38:23.150
I told you it would work.

38:23.150 --> 38:26.250
So, do you want me to just leave?

38:26.250 --> 38:29.120
No. Please come in.

38:29.820 --> 38:33.120

38:57.650 --> 38:59.580
Are you really gonna do this?

39:00.120 --> 39:02.320
What else should I do?

39:03.290 --> 39:04.520
I came in for an injection.

39:04.520 --> 39:06.720
It's weird if I don't inject.

39:06.720 --> 39:08.360
Others can't see you.

39:08.360 --> 39:08.890
So, you don't care.

39:08.890 --> 39:11.030
But it bothers me.

39:11.530 --> 39:13.800
Don't you see they are watching me from behind?

39:13.800 --> 39:16.830
Hey! You're in my way. Get out.

39:28.750 --> 39:30.780
Uh, wait a minute.

It's not good to act rashly.

Very bad.

Use this!

39:40.590 --> 39:43.730
There's no place in this hospital I can't go.

39:51.500 --> 39:53.900
How about we ask the patient if he wants an injection?

39:53.900 --> 39:55.240
What are you talking about?

39:55.240 --> 39:57.940
How can you talk to the President this way?

40:01.510 --> 40:04.150
Hey, come on. I want you to get out!

40:06.450 --> 40:08.250
Give it to me.

40:08.250 --> 40:08.920
Give it to me!

40:08.920 --> 40:09.750
Eh!

40:09.750 --> 40:10.620
Eh!

40:10.620 --> 40:14.190
Eh!

40:16.890 --> 40:18.290
Stop!

40:18.290 --> 40:20.760
What are you doing?

40:27.470 --> 40:29.870
Then, I'm leaving.

40:35.680 --> 40:37.880
This kid is good at acting.

40:39.220 --> 40:40.850
What's going on?

42:08.540 --> 42:09.370
Gosh!

42:09.370 --> 42:10.770
You scared me.

42:11.470 --> 42:13.140
How come you came out from there?

42:13.140 --> 42:14.080
With Jang Min Ho's bad temper,

42:14.080 --> 42:15.780
if he finds out that I was here,

42:15.780 --> 42:18.280
you two will be in trouble.

42:18.280 --> 42:20.920
So, you'd better stay out of my way in the future.

42:20.920 --> 42:22.850
But don't be pushovers either.

42:22.850 --> 42:25.620
I won't make you lose your job.

42:28.420 --> 42:29.590
Darn it.

42:29.590 --> 42:32.130
Have you changed your mind?

42:34.630 --> 42:37.570
It's more of a change of situation.

42:51.780 --> 42:54.250
Luckily, we have a fingerprint ID system.

42:59.090 --> 43:01.490
The Professor Cha I know

43:01.490 --> 43:05.730
has a high sense of responsibility toward patients.

43:07.030 --> 43:09.500
Why was such a responsible doctor

43:09.500 --> 43:12.000
absent from duty before the patient woke up?

43:13.340 --> 43:15.340
Because of me.

43:15.340 --> 43:17.640
I called Professor Cha out.

43:19.280 --> 43:21.110
[I want to see you now, could you come out?
I will go back to America by air tomorrow morning.
There's something I really need to talk to you before I leave.
I will be waiting for you at the place we used to go a lot.]

43:21.810 --> 43:23.380
Some of the jerks you just talked about

43:23.380 --> 43:25.980
used me.

43:25.980 --> 43:28.320
I wonder why you don't expose

43:28.320 --> 43:30.590
the things you know.

43:30.590 --> 43:34.190
I don't do well with complicated matters.

43:36.690 --> 43:38.630
Besides, I don't have evidence.

43:42.870 --> 43:44.370
However,

43:44.370 --> 43:46.940
we have a witness.

43:47.970 --> 43:51.510
This is the motorcyclist who also got involved in the accident with Professor Cha.

43:51.510 --> 43:54.810
We may be able to find a solution if he wakes up.

43:54.810 --> 43:57.610
I'll take care of this patient from now on.

43:57.610 --> 44:00.220
Let me take a look at his chart.

44:01.820 --> 44:05.490
Is it okay to get her involved?

44:05.490 --> 44:07.260
That's why I want to cooperate

44:07.260 --> 44:09.860
in the least risky way.

44:11.330 --> 44:14.130
The Se Jin I know

44:14.130 --> 44:15.700
would always fight for justice.

44:15.700 --> 44:17.400
She's a brave woman.

44:17.800 --> 44:20.570
She won't give up even if you try to stop her.

44:22.410 --> 44:24.770
I'm really curious

44:24.770 --> 44:26.540
about your relationship.

44:26.580 --> 44:29.580
Stop prying into my personal life.

44:30.150 --> 44:31.780
I'm also curious about

44:31.780 --> 44:34.650
why you can see ghosts?

44:34.650 --> 44:37.650
Are you asking me? You think I'd answer that?

44:37.650 --> 44:39.590
Are we that close?

44:39.590 --> 44:42.590
Oh, boy! How narrow-minded you are!

44:42.590 --> 44:44.360
That's bad.

44:48.700 --> 44:50.730
Isn't it obvious?

44:51.430 --> 44:53.540
Actually, I don't even know

44:54.170 --> 44:56.540
what our relationship was.

45:49.690 --> 45:54.830
My Seung Jo is brave. You can do it, right?

45:54.830 --> 45:58.370
Yeah. I can do it.

47:51.010 --> 47:53.680
Come out, Go Seung Tak!

Please.

No.

48:39.760 --> 48:41.100
Shall we start?

48:41.100 --> 48:43.830
Yes. Let's do it.

48:43.830 --> 48:46.570
O Seung Jo, seven years old. His right ventricular catheter ruptured.

48:46.570 --> 48:48.570

Scalpel.

48:54.810 --> 48:59.320
Hey, where's Jeo?

-Emergency Room!
-Emergency...

Emergency...

49:06.660 --> 49:08.990
Yeah!

49:11.460 --> 49:13.900
Give me the tweezers.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.170
Eh? Ah-oh.

49:22.240 --> 49:30.880
Are you… out of your mind?

49:30.880 --> 49:33.120
We can't drop our hands like that during operation,

49:33.120 --> 49:35.120
right? I placed my hands too low.

49:35.120 --> 49:38.490
Why did you ask for the tweezers?

49:38.490 --> 49:43.090
Huh? I can't hold them? I'm sorry.

49:43.090 --> 49:44.730
Go and wash your hands.

49:44.730 --> 49:47.500
Okay.

49:53.470 --> 49:56.210
Gosh, look how silly he is.

O Su Jeong, are you crazy?

50:21.500 --> 50:22.830
How could you feed water to a patient

50:22.830 --> 50:24.730
who might receive an emergency surgery?

50:24.730 --> 50:26.470
You might as well feed him a meal, too!

50:26.470 --> 50:29.740
I didn't feed him water, but

50:29.740 --> 50:33.510
it was my fault that I didn't inform his family in advance.

50:33.510 --> 50:35.510
I apologize.

50:36.610 --> 50:38.780
Are… Are you trying to mess with me?

50:38.780 --> 50:41.750
No. I'm just reflecting on my mistake.

Well…

Like I said,

50:47.760 --> 50:51.560
the pretty ones are all trouble-makers.

50:51.560 --> 50:53.760
Exactly. There are people

50:53.760 --> 50:55.330
who always walk on the floor I just cleaned.

What are you doing? You won't do the suction?

51:25.290 --> 51:28.430
Oh, the suction.

51:28.430 --> 51:32.600
You can't put it there.

Oh, not here.
