[Jessica] <i>Pain is always a surprise.</i>

01:25.336 --> 01:27.881
Help! Somebody, please. Please help!

01:27.964 --> 01:29.590
<i>I try to avoid landmines.</i>

01:29.674 --> 01:31.635
- What happened?
- [stutters] He hit his head.

01:31.718 --> 01:33.469
<i>Avoid caring.</i>

01:33.552 --> 01:35.596
<i>I can even see it coming.</i>

01:35.680 --> 01:39.017
<i>But until it hits, you
have no idea what pain is.</i>

01:39.100 --> 01:41.477
- [doctor] What do we got?
- [nurse] A head injury with LOC.

01:41.560 --> 01:42.937
Possible blunt force trauma.

01:43.021 --> 01:45.564
- Unresponsive.
- [doctor] No bruising, lacerations.

01:45.649 --> 01:46.983
I'm telling you, he got knocked out.

01:47.066 --> 01:49.360
Gunpowder? Did you see him get shot?

01:49.443 --> 01:50.569
I saw him unconscious.

01:50.654 --> 01:52.238
- Are you gonna do something?
- Let's get a CT scan.

01:52.321 --> 01:53.740
- You can wait in the reception area.
- No.

01:53.823 --> 01:54.908
Hey, you did a good thing.

01:54.991 --> 01:56.575
If he survives, it's because of you.

02:01.580 --> 02:03.332
[sighs]

02:03.416 --> 02:05.543
[doctor] Cerebral edema
with mass effect.

02:05.627 --> 02:07.545
Prep for an intracerebral
pressure catheter,

02:07.629 --> 02:09.964
100 grams of mannitol to
bring the swelling down.

02:14.803 --> 02:16.304
Oh, shit.

02:25.604 --> 02:27.023
Something's weird with the needle.

02:27.106 --> 02:28.607
Sorry.

02:39.077 --> 02:40.286
Come on!

02:40.369 --> 02:42.413
- What the hell are you doing?
- It's not me.

02:42.496 --> 02:43.539
- You're done.
- No.

02:43.622 --> 02:45.041
It's him! Or these needles!

02:46.250 --> 02:48.170
I need a damn nurse who
knows what they're doing.

02:48.211 --> 02:50.011
- [Jessica] You're wasting time!
- I got this.

02:59.388 --> 03:00.890
[monitor beeps rapidly]

03:00.974 --> 03:02.851
Blood pressure's climbing.

03:02.934 --> 03:04.018
[doctor] He can't wait.

03:04.102 --> 03:06.437
- [whirring]
- No, do something non-invasive.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.605
Remove her, please.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.190
180 over 110.

03:09.273 --> 03:11.567
- Ma'am, I'm gonna have you...
- Get off me.

03:24.873 --> 03:26.624
[gasps]

03:26.707 --> 03:28.334
[doctor sighs]

03:28.417 --> 03:29.627
Okay.

03:31.212 --> 03:34.048
He's, uh... one of those.

03:35.424 --> 03:39.012
I need the Head of Surgery,
and find the Chief of Staff.

03:40.304 --> 03:42.223
I need a consult.

03:43.432 --> 03:45.512
[nurse] Uh, I'm sorry, sir.
I can't let you in there.

03:46.519 --> 03:47.645
Please help him.

03:47.729 --> 03:50.523
I'm not a doctor. I don't think
any doctor can fix this.

03:50.606 --> 03:52.150
Then I need to get him out of here.

03:53.985 --> 03:55.569
[inaudible]

03:56.112 --> 03:58.948
You know, if those cops are here
for him, I need to report this.

03:59.032 --> 04:00.950
The cops have it wrong.
He is a good man.

04:01.034 --> 04:03.411
He just got used by an evil prick.

04:03.494 --> 04:05.830
This evil prick the one who
put a shotgun to his head?

04:05.914 --> 04:07.634
No, that was me, and I
didn't have a choice.

04:08.332 --> 04:10.752
- Okay, I'm done.
- I did have a choice...

04:10.835 --> 04:12.336
and I chose to survive.

04:12.420 --> 04:13.421
Ow.

04:16.966 --> 04:18.634
You know, moving him might kill him.

04:18.716 --> 04:20.928
[sighs] Leaving him
here will expose him.

04:27.977 --> 04:29.938
[Jessica breathing heavily]

04:30.021 --> 04:33.607
Look, I know that we scare you, and
you've never seen anything like us,

04:33.691 --> 04:34.818
but this is a good man.

04:35.777 --> 04:37.736
- And you?
- I'm an asshole.

04:37.821 --> 04:39.989
But help me or get out of my way.

04:40.782 --> 04:43.659
You don't scare me, and
you're not my first.

04:50.749 --> 04:53.294
The fifth floor bridge goes to a
parking structure across the street.

04:53.377 --> 04:54.697
- [elevator dings]
- I have a car.

05:06.557 --> 05:08.101
Where are you taking him?

05:08.184 --> 05:11.395
[sighs] Out of here.
That's as far as I got.

05:11.479 --> 05:14.899
Well, you're not taking him to my place.
Been there, done that, lost my lease.

05:14.983 --> 05:16.234
My apartment's close.

05:16.317 --> 05:18.486
It's a disaster, but
he already knows that.

05:18.569 --> 05:19.570
[Claire sighs]

05:20.488 --> 05:22.198
Is he gonna die?

05:24.408 --> 05:25.869
I don't know.

05:25.952 --> 05:30.248
You can ice him, use oral
meds to reduce his swelling.

05:30.331 --> 05:32.458
But it's... it's a crapshoot.

05:35.711 --> 05:38.506
Might as well stop that right now.
It won't do him any good.

05:38.589 --> 05:41.384
- Stop what?
- Guilt makes people do stupid shit.

05:42.010 --> 05:43.219
I'm not guilty.

05:44.178 --> 05:45.554
It's not my fault.

05:46.555 --> 05:48.391
See, I hate that.

05:49.100 --> 05:52.770
I want everything to be my fault.
Good or bad.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.688
Means I have some control.

05:54.772 --> 05:57.984
- You don't.
- Obviously.

05:58.067 --> 06:01.779
But it keeps me dreaming I can
change things for people.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.364
Case in point.

06:04.490 --> 06:05.574
You're in total control.

06:05.658 --> 06:08.411
You're responsible for all
of this and I blame you.

06:08.494 --> 06:09.537
- [elevator dings]
- Don't push it.

06:09.620 --> 06:10.997
[sighs]

06:13.041 --> 06:14.125
Hey.

06:15.084 --> 06:16.920
[woman speaking indistinctly on PA]

06:20.631 --> 06:22.967
[phone ringing]

06:29.890 --> 06:30.934
Just in case.

06:31.767 --> 06:33.061
Jessica Jones?

06:34.979 --> 06:36.897
- Why?
- Are you Jessica Jones?

06:37.606 --> 06:41.694
Ellie, we've met. I'm
Claire, down in Emergency.

06:41.777 --> 06:44.155
This call is for you.
You have to take it.

06:48.909 --> 06:51.162
Will you take him to this address?

07:10.889 --> 07:12.058
What?

07:12.141 --> 07:15.228
[Kilgrave] <i>Oh, come on, be a
little surprised it's me.</i>

07:15.311 --> 07:18.982
You found me at the only hospital
in the neighborhood. Big surprise.

07:20.816 --> 07:22.651
You've expanded your reach.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.654
But not to me.

07:25.738 --> 07:29.242
<i>Should have known you'd save your
own skin, boyfriend be damned.</i>

07:29.325 --> 07:31.077
<i>Selfish as ever.</i>

07:31.827 --> 07:35.039
<i>Clearly, it's not better
to have loved and lost.</i>

07:35.831 --> 07:39.168
<i>- I'm sure you regret having ever met Luke.</i>
- Where's your security center?

07:39.252 --> 07:40.962
Uh, east wing, second floor.

07:42.921 --> 07:45.341
I certainly regret meeting you.

07:45.424 --> 07:48.302
Oh, good, then we finally
have something in common.

07:48.386 --> 07:49.553
Regret.

07:49.637 --> 07:52.848
And hatred. Let's not
forget about that one.

07:54.017 --> 07:56.935
<i>Fortunately, for you, we're
already at a hospital,</i>

07:57.020 --> 08:00.689
so when I rip your tongue from
your skull, it'll be a short trip.

08:02.941 --> 08:06.529
You really are a little
anal crumpet, aren't you?

08:06.612 --> 08:09.532
<i>Name calling, that's
not really your style.</i>

08:10.533 --> 08:13.327
<i>Oh, no, are you upset
with me for not dying?</i>

08:13.411 --> 08:15.329
<i>Did I foil your evil plan?</i>

08:15.413 --> 08:18.124
"Evil"? Come on, how reductive.

08:19.625 --> 08:23.046
I suppose "me, evil" means
"you, good." Bullshit.

08:23.129 --> 08:27.091
<i>I mean, it's true that I've
never given a second thought</i>

08:27.175 --> 08:30.803
<i>to anyone that I've let die, but
I take no pleasure in it...</i>

08:32.679 --> 08:35.140
<i>like a truly evil man would.</i>

08:35.224 --> 08:38.561
<i>I'm merely... removing nuisances.</i>

08:38.644 --> 08:40.520
<i>Public service, really.</i>

08:40.604 --> 08:42.606
<i>But you...</i>

08:42.690 --> 08:47.320
<i>I believe for the first time, I
will rather enjoy watching you die.</i>

08:47.403 --> 08:48.946
The feeling's mutual.

08:57.496 --> 08:59.165
Jessica Jones!

08:59.748 --> 09:01.167
[gun shots]

09:19.435 --> 09:23.021
[woman on TV] <i>...simply removes the
fish from the skin and at that point...</i>

09:23.106 --> 09:26.192
[Kilgrave on PA] <i>Paging all
personnel, visitors, the whining,</i>

09:26.275 --> 09:27.943
<i>the wounded and dying.</i>

09:28.026 --> 09:29.153
Oh, hell, no.

09:29.237 --> 09:32.406
<i>A dangerous virus has been
spread throughout this building.</i>

09:32.490 --> 09:36.410
<i>For emergency instructions, turn
to your closest video screen.</i>

09:39.413 --> 09:42.708
<i>This is Jessica Jones.</i>

09:42.791 --> 09:44.502
He can't control everyone
in the hospital.

09:44.585 --> 09:46.587
<i>She is patient zero.</i>

09:46.670 --> 09:51.634
<i>Her poison will destroy you all,
unless you find and kill her first.</i>

09:51.717 --> 09:52.718
<i>Now.</i>

09:53.386 --> 09:55.804
[gasps] Unless he can.

09:55.888 --> 09:58.182
- Stay, you'll break a hip.
- [grunting]

10:00.684 --> 10:01.935
[doctor] Hey!

10:02.019 --> 10:03.354
[doctor grunting]

10:05.106 --> 10:07.150
[man 1] Search the other ones!
She's not in here.

10:07.233 --> 10:09.527
- [woman 1] All clear.
- [man 2] Check the other one.

10:09.610 --> 10:11.445
[woman 2] We haven't found her yet!

10:11.529 --> 10:13.156
[woman 3] She's gotta
be here somewhere.

10:15.158 --> 10:16.742
[man 3] Go down the east hallway.

10:19.077 --> 10:21.247
[Jessica] Can't wait to kill
this Jessica Jones, huh?

10:21.330 --> 10:23.081
Have to find her first.

10:23.166 --> 10:25.726
- [man 4] No, this is clear.
- [woman 3] Let's take this hallway.

10:26.127 --> 10:27.545
[grunts]

10:27.628 --> 10:28.754
Jessica Jones!

10:28.837 --> 10:30.157
- [grunts]
- [man 4] It's Jessica!

10:34.302 --> 10:36.137
[Jessica grunts] God damn it!

10:47.315 --> 10:49.317
Your girlfriend's a slob.

10:55.406 --> 10:56.657
[sighs]

11:02.830 --> 11:04.373
Man, you got powers.

11:04.457 --> 11:06.792
Now is the time to use 'em. [sighs]

11:19.305 --> 11:20.389
[sighs]

11:21.307 --> 11:22.558
Oh, shit!

11:22.641 --> 11:24.977
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

11:28.272 --> 11:29.273
[door opening]

11:29.815 --> 11:31.817
- Okay.
- [door closes]

11:32.651 --> 11:34.987
- What the hell are you doing?
- Hold his head still!

11:41.034 --> 11:44.079
- I gotta drain the cerebral-spinal fluid.
- He has unbreakable skin.

11:44.162 --> 11:46.665
- I'm not going through his skin.
- Are you serious?

11:48.125 --> 11:49.252
Jesus!

11:49.335 --> 11:51.712
I have to slide the needle
along the optic nerve,

11:51.795 --> 11:53.797
so I need you to hold him very still.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.591
- Can you do that?
- Can you do that?

11:56.550 --> 11:58.927
[sighs] I have no idea.

11:59.887 --> 12:00.888
Okay.

12:05.518 --> 12:06.685
Ugh!

12:08.437 --> 12:10.105
Okay.

12:10.188 --> 12:11.440
I'm going in.

12:11.524 --> 12:13.276
- Ugh!
- I have to get into the cranium.

12:14.985 --> 12:16.654
Ah, Jesus.

12:17.655 --> 12:19.573
- You puke, he's done!
- I'm good.

12:21.116 --> 12:22.285
I'm in.

12:28.832 --> 12:30.418
[Jessica groans]

12:40.678 --> 12:42.388
[breathing heavily]

12:51.939 --> 12:53.941
Is he gonna be all right?

12:55.734 --> 12:58.153
[exhales] Won't know till he wakes up.

12:58.236 --> 12:59.988
[breathing heavily]

13:03.409 --> 13:06.620
I need a drink. You want a drink?

13:06.704 --> 13:08.539
I'm having a drink.

13:08.622 --> 13:10.207
It's 5:00 in the morning.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.500
Exactly.

13:12.335 --> 13:14.002
[sighs]

13:18.549 --> 13:20.634
Do you know where Luke's phone is?

13:20.718 --> 13:21.719
[Claire] Yeah.

13:22.720 --> 13:25.889
It was the only thing on him.
He hasn't gotten any calls.

13:27.350 --> 13:29.352
Just keep him iced.

13:29.435 --> 13:31.144
At this point, it's
just a waiting game.

13:31.228 --> 13:33.021
I have to get back to the hospital.

13:34.022 --> 13:35.315
Did you get cut?

13:37.150 --> 13:39.027
I suppose I gotta look at that.

13:39.570 --> 13:42.948
I have to go. Just need
to find out where.

13:43.031 --> 13:44.658
You have to go?

13:44.742 --> 13:46.869
With a large unconscious
man in your bed?

13:46.952 --> 13:48.496
He won't be the last...

13:50.163 --> 13:52.500
person hurt by Kilgrave.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.835
The so-called "evil prick"?

13:54.918 --> 13:56.420
[sighs] Stupid phone is dead.

13:57.880 --> 13:59.089
All right, well...

13:59.172 --> 14:00.883
if your leg gets infected,
you're not going anywhere.

14:00.966 --> 14:02.385
Take off your pants.

14:03.301 --> 14:06.263
- [bag unzipping]
- I usually like a little more romancing.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.556
Don't we all?

14:08.766 --> 14:09.892
[drops phone]

14:14.980 --> 14:16.607
So, did Kilgrave do that to you?

14:16.690 --> 14:19.109
No, he doesn't do his own dirty work.

14:20.027 --> 14:23.030
- He controls minds.
- You're joking.

14:23.113 --> 14:26.659
It's fine by me if unbreakable skin
is where you wanna draw the line.

14:26.742 --> 14:31.246
Guess it's just harder to believe someone
would call himself... "Kilgrave."

14:31.329 --> 14:33.081
I mean, why not just "Snuffcarcass"?

14:33.832 --> 14:35.167
[chuckles]

14:35.250 --> 14:38.796
- [winces]
- Clean and deep.

14:38.879 --> 14:42.925
But I think we can get
away without stitches.

14:44.510 --> 14:46.261
So, how do you stop a mind-controller?

14:47.388 --> 14:48.972
I have to find him first.

14:50.516 --> 14:52.726
Kilgrave had control of Luke.

14:52.810 --> 14:55.270
He had him calling in
with updates on me.

14:55.353 --> 14:58.524
So, if I can trace the number
that Luke was calling,

14:58.607 --> 15:01.485
it might get me closer to
where Kilgrave is holed up.

15:01.569 --> 15:03.236
And what makes you the
one who has to face him?

15:03.320 --> 15:05.489
Crap-ass luck.

15:07.700 --> 15:09.660
[Claire] I had...

15:09.743 --> 15:13.497
have a friend like you and Luke.

15:13.581 --> 15:15.123
Bleeding and unconscious?

15:15.791 --> 15:17.668
Yeah, actually, more often than not.

15:17.751 --> 15:20.087
He makes life hard for bad guys.

15:21.338 --> 15:23.507
How's he so sure he's the good guy?

15:24.717 --> 15:25.884
He isn't.

15:25.968 --> 15:28.679
He questions every move he makes...

15:28.762 --> 15:31.264
every thought he has.

15:31.348 --> 15:33.350
Just like I'm guessing you do.

15:35.227 --> 15:37.855
I could reach out to him.
He might help.

15:39.565 --> 15:42.067
I can't risk another
person getting controlled.

15:42.985 --> 15:45.529
It's the only thing I don't question.

15:45.613 --> 15:47.490
I have to kill him on my own.

15:53.579 --> 15:57.332
[breathing heavily] I couldn't stop her.
And it's your bloody fault, Dad!

15:57.415 --> 15:59.585
You're more powerful than ever.

16:00.127 --> 16:02.921
What would happen if you gave me the lot?
All of it?

16:03.005 --> 16:04.548
A whole dram?

16:04.632 --> 16:06.383
I don't know.

16:06.467 --> 16:08.218
Well, make an educated guess.

16:08.301 --> 16:11.013
40% chance it makes you stronger.

16:11.096 --> 16:13.265
60% it kills you.

16:15.308 --> 16:16.727
I know which one I want.

16:17.978 --> 16:20.105
What about you, Dad? Which do you want?

16:20.188 --> 16:21.899
I want it to kill you.

16:22.399 --> 16:23.567
Hmm.

16:24.693 --> 16:26.153
His own son, imagine.

16:28.155 --> 16:29.197
Well...

16:33.035 --> 16:35.453
for what it's worth,
I feel the same way.

16:46.464 --> 16:47.716
[inhales deeply]

16:47.800 --> 16:49.342
Give me everything you've got.

16:50.719 --> 16:53.138
Maybe I'll get strong enough
to control her again.

16:53.221 --> 16:54.431
[softly] God.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.475
Dear God, I would do anything
to see the look on her face

16:57.560 --> 16:59.812
when she realizes she's helpless.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.147
I'd make her want me.

17:05.025 --> 17:06.318
Then reject her.

17:06.401 --> 17:09.613
Devastate her over and over and
over until she wants to die.

17:10.405 --> 17:11.615
[breath trembling]

17:12.950 --> 17:14.827
No, I won't give her that, either.

17:17.996 --> 17:21.584
She'd wither away like someone
dying of thirst or starvation.

17:22.835 --> 17:26.378
Be a certain ring of hell,
designed specially for her.

17:26.463 --> 17:28.173
[inhales deeply]

17:31.885 --> 17:33.887
Or maybe I'll just kill her.

17:39.309 --> 17:40.936
Shall we, Albert?

17:43.230 --> 17:45.232
Let the experiment begin.

18:14.094 --> 18:15.387
[sighs]

18:28.108 --> 18:29.777
I thought about you.

18:33.321 --> 18:35.532
I mean, I knew it would never happen.

18:36.449 --> 18:37.701
[sighs]

18:39.452 --> 18:42.873
But I couldn't help... picturing us.

18:47.377 --> 18:49.337
Like, on an actual date.

18:53.300 --> 18:54.551
Bowling.

18:56.762 --> 18:58.180
Normal shit. [Chuckles]

19:03.560 --> 19:06.980
You're the first person I
ever pictured a future with.

19:11.484 --> 19:14.446
You're also the first person
I ever shot in the head.

19:25.207 --> 19:26.499
If you...

19:28.001 --> 19:29.627
When you wake up...

19:32.756 --> 19:35.801
I'm not gonna be around to
screw up your life anymore.

19:38.178 --> 19:40.305
Probably because I'll be dead.

19:42.850 --> 19:45.268
But maybe Kilgrave will be dead, too.

19:46.687 --> 19:48.188
[Claire] You got power!

19:54.027 --> 19:55.403
Your phone.

19:56.697 --> 19:58.699
Might get me to Kilgrave.

19:58.782 --> 20:00.492
[scoffs]

20:00.575 --> 20:03.578
You're freaking unconscious
and you're helping me.

20:18.260 --> 20:20.220
I would have liked that future.

20:44.494 --> 20:45.829
[Kilgrave exhales]

20:46.955 --> 20:48.248
This could sting.

20:48.331 --> 20:51.209
It doesn't sting, Dad, it burns
like a poxy branding iron.

21:04.681 --> 21:06.058
[Kilgrave groaning]

21:13.690 --> 21:15.525
[grunting vigorously]

21:19.362 --> 21:20.738
[screaming]

21:28.831 --> 21:30.082
[Claire] Find something?

21:31.124 --> 21:32.375
Justin Boden.

21:32.459 --> 21:34.419
[Claire] Who's he?

21:34.502 --> 21:37.672
Hedge fund broker. Fancy address.

21:37.755 --> 21:40.008
Kilgrave used his phone to call Luke.

21:40.092 --> 21:42.177
He can just take someone's
phone like that?

21:42.260 --> 21:43.971
They're lucky if that's all he takes.

21:44.637 --> 21:45.889
[Claire sighs]

21:48.976 --> 21:50.102
Claire, I need a favor.

21:50.185 --> 21:53.730
- Another favor.
- [sighs] I have to get to work.

21:53.814 --> 21:55.023
I know.

21:56.608 --> 21:58.443
You help people.

21:58.526 --> 22:00.362
That's who you are.

22:00.445 --> 22:03.240
And you make the rest of us
look like selfish pricks.

22:04.241 --> 22:05.617
Is that a compliment or...

22:05.700 --> 22:08.161
There are other nurses at
the hospital who can help.

22:08.996 --> 22:10.497
There's only one that can help Luke.

22:10.580 --> 22:11.832
[Claire sighs]

22:13.083 --> 22:16.086
I just don't want him to wake up
alone, not knowing what's happening.

22:16.169 --> 22:18.463
I don't even know what's happening.

22:19.172 --> 22:23.135
It's asking a lot, and you
don't know me, but...

22:23.218 --> 22:24.344
[sighs]

22:26.138 --> 22:27.639
[Claire sighs]

22:29.766 --> 22:31.226
Sure I do.

22:33.103 --> 22:34.646
I've seen you with your pants down.

22:46.533 --> 22:47.700
[cell phone beeps]

22:49.119 --> 22:52.414
Hey, can you pick me up?

22:52.497 --> 22:54.917
Thanks, Trish. I'll be waiting outside.

22:57.294 --> 22:59.671
I go up there, I might not come back.

23:01.798 --> 23:05.218
So I want you to tell me what you
came over the other day to tell me.

23:05.302 --> 23:07.554
[sighs] What is this, last words?

23:07.637 --> 23:09.139
I want to know.

23:13.351 --> 23:17.272
The IGH private research group
that funded Simpson's drug trials?

23:18.648 --> 23:22.610
I might've found something that connects
it to you and how you got your powers.

23:26.489 --> 23:29.076
I gave up looking for
answers a long time ago.

23:29.159 --> 23:30.368
I didn't.

23:32.037 --> 23:35.082
Look, it might be something,
it might lead to nothing.

23:37.917 --> 23:41.254
- There have been a lot of dead ends.
- I know.

23:41.338 --> 23:43.506
But you just kept pushing past them.

23:45.050 --> 23:47.510
It's like you have this iron will.

23:50.263 --> 23:52.349
Hold on to it for me, will you?

23:56.311 --> 23:59.064
- Trish, don't!
- I'm finishing this with you.

23:59.689 --> 24:03.110
[sighs] I was gonna say, wait
until I call for backup.

24:03.193 --> 24:06.571
Teamwork, right? I read
about that somewhere.

24:06.654 --> 24:10.450
Okay, I'll wait here. Just... text me.

24:10.533 --> 24:13.120
You won't know if I'm a minion of evil.

24:13.911 --> 24:16.123
Well, we need a signal.

24:16.206 --> 24:19.167
Something you would never say, like...

24:19.251 --> 24:21.836
"sardines" or "pickle juice."

24:21.919 --> 24:24.631
You say it, you're still you.

24:26.216 --> 24:28.051
Something I never say.

24:30.137 --> 24:31.679
Like, "I love you."

24:38.353 --> 24:40.313
That'll do. [Sighs]

24:46.986 --> 24:48.530
[whirring]

25:01.959 --> 25:04.046
[whirring continues]

25:50.049 --> 25:51.801
[grinding]

25:55.805 --> 25:56.848
Hey!

25:57.682 --> 25:59.809
Hey, where's Kilgrave?

25:59.892 --> 26:01.269
Jesus Christ!

26:03.563 --> 26:04.564
Stop!

26:04.647 --> 26:07.234
I... I have to remove Dad
from the face of the Earth.

26:07.317 --> 26:09.111
No, you don't. Stop, it's okay.

26:09.194 --> 26:11.321
But then we have to kill ourselves!
[grunts]

26:57.325 --> 26:58.951
[sighs]

27:16.553 --> 27:19.055
[gasps] Oh, God.

27:19.639 --> 27:20.848
He's stronger.

27:20.932 --> 27:23.685
Don't listen. Don't look at him.

27:23.768 --> 27:26.020
He'll make you kill.

27:26.103 --> 27:27.522
Where did he go?

27:29.566 --> 27:30.775
Albert.

27:46.791 --> 27:48.042
[cell phone chimes]

27:59.554 --> 28:00.888
[engine starts]

28:05.518 --> 28:07.645
[sighs] I can't come in, Shirley.

28:09.063 --> 28:11.107
I have a personal emergency.

28:12.859 --> 28:14.569
I know we're short, but...

28:16.404 --> 28:17.614
[sighs]

28:20.074 --> 28:21.200
Okay.

28:22.869 --> 28:24.329
I'll come when I can.

28:26.373 --> 28:28.458
- [sighs]
- [Malcolm] Who are you?

28:30.752 --> 28:33.463
- [Claire] Who are you?
- Neighbor.

28:33.546 --> 28:34.631
Nurse.

28:35.632 --> 28:38.885
Oh, shit. Is Jessica hurt?

28:38.968 --> 28:41.346
She's all right, far as I know.

28:41.429 --> 28:42.847
Where is she?

28:43.931 --> 28:45.057
[Claire sighs]

28:47.394 --> 28:49.145
Jess?

28:49.229 --> 28:50.522
Oh, God damn.

28:51.856 --> 28:54.901
- You know him?
- Yeah, Luke. What happened to him?

28:54.984 --> 28:56.819
I don't know.

28:56.903 --> 28:58.280
Not sure I want to.

29:00.448 --> 29:04.577
So, are... you some
kind of special nurse?

29:04.661 --> 29:06.788
"Special"? As in...

29:11.459 --> 29:13.670
Nope, I'm not special.

29:13.753 --> 29:15.672
I just keep running into special.

29:15.755 --> 29:18.090
Ah, you and me both.

29:18.174 --> 29:20.134
- Is it a good thing?
- [sighs]

29:21.093 --> 29:23.220
- Can't change what we know.
- [chuckles]

29:23.305 --> 29:25.097
Yeah, I miss ignorance, too.

29:27.016 --> 29:28.351
[chuckles]

29:35.275 --> 29:37.485
Wasn't that long ago I was...

29:37.569 --> 29:40.071
trying to get my degree in social work.

29:40.154 --> 29:41.238
Wanted to help people?

29:41.323 --> 29:43.199
I still do.

29:43.283 --> 29:44.576
Well...

29:45.493 --> 29:47.329
don't need powers to be of use.

29:47.412 --> 29:49.246
I don't want powers.

29:49.331 --> 29:53.167
I mean, I do not want to be on the
receiving end of them either, but...

29:54.419 --> 29:56.671
I don't know, I just...
I like people too much.

29:58.715 --> 29:59.966
Luke, Jessica,

30:00.049 --> 30:03.428
just by necessity, by
definition, they're separate.

30:03.511 --> 30:04.929
Even from each other.

30:05.012 --> 30:07.014
Maybe that's what they
need most from us.

30:08.891 --> 30:10.267
Connection.

30:10.352 --> 30:13.062
What does that make us? Sidekicks?

30:13.145 --> 30:14.731
Oh, I'm no one's sidekick.

30:14.814 --> 30:16.148
I can see that.

30:18.275 --> 30:20.737
Jessica's got it in her, you know?

30:20.820 --> 30:23.948
And she may well never find
it, but it is in there.

30:24.031 --> 30:25.617
An alcoholic?

30:25.700 --> 30:27.159
A hero.

30:28.870 --> 30:30.162
Tough business.

30:30.747 --> 30:32.624
So is yours.

30:32.707 --> 30:35.502
Why don't you take a break for a while?
I'll watch him.

30:37.462 --> 30:38.838
[sighs]

30:44.802 --> 30:46.012
Thanks.

30:49.766 --> 30:52.810
You're not a... mind-controller, right?

30:53.520 --> 30:55.605
Kilgrave. Evil prick.

30:56.439 --> 30:57.940
[softly] Okay.

30:58.024 --> 30:59.567
I'll be on the couch.

31:08.618 --> 31:12.622
Man, if you got taken down,
we are all in the shit.

31:16.876 --> 31:19.170
- [phone ringing]
- Christ.

31:20.171 --> 31:21.172
Jeri Hogarth.

31:21.255 --> 31:24.842
"Biological material, fetal
tissue, Hope Shlottman.

31:24.926 --> 31:27.261
Submitted to testing by J. Hogarth."

31:27.344 --> 31:30.765
Kilgrave made me tell him where it was.
It's useless anyway.

31:30.848 --> 31:33.225
No, it made him stronger.

31:33.309 --> 31:35.978
<i>I don't know what else I can
do to pay for my mistakes.</i>

31:36.062 --> 31:39.607
I have bled for them, I have lost
everything that I care about.

31:39.691 --> 31:42.610
Pam is facing murder charges,
and she won't see me,

31:42.694 --> 31:45.112
<i>and my partners are forcing me out.</i>

31:45.196 --> 31:46.406
Don't let them.

31:46.489 --> 31:47.865
Excuse me?

31:47.949 --> 31:49.283
<i>- Fight them.</i>
- Why?

31:49.366 --> 31:50.910
Because you are who you are.

31:50.993 --> 31:53.955
A sack of dark oozing shit
in an expensive suit.

31:54.038 --> 31:55.081
Jessica...

31:55.164 --> 31:56.874
<i>Which makes you the best shark in town,</i>

31:56.958 --> 31:59.502
<i>and you're gonna represent
Justin Boden pro bono.</i>

31:59.586 --> 32:01.921
- Who?
- Another one of Kilgrave's victims.

32:02.004 --> 32:03.965
He's gonna be charged with murder.

32:04.048 --> 32:07.384
- Keep him safe.
<i>- Why? Where are you going?</i>

32:07.469 --> 32:10.513
I'll text you the info. And
this does not make us square.

32:12.264 --> 32:15.309
[sighs] But doing something...

32:15.392 --> 32:17.144
good...

32:17.228 --> 32:20.022
it helps with the self-loathing.
Trust me.

32:21.858 --> 32:23.109
[dial tone]

32:25.236 --> 32:26.278
[sighs]

32:26.946 --> 32:29.031
You know, he left this
here for you to find.

32:29.115 --> 32:30.742
[sighs]

32:30.825 --> 32:32.159
Subtle, right?

32:33.369 --> 32:37.289
It's docked at the Hudson Ferry Terminal.
I found the bills.

32:37.373 --> 32:39.041
And he wants you to go there.

32:39.125 --> 32:41.753
He must be feeling confident.

32:41.836 --> 32:44.046
At least now it'll end.

32:44.130 --> 32:45.590
One way or another.

33:07.403 --> 33:09.405
[noise pop music playing]

33:23.920 --> 33:25.337
[music inaudible]

33:29.383 --> 33:32.720
And here we are for the
last and final round.

33:32.804 --> 33:34.889
[music continues]

33:36.641 --> 33:39.602
- [music inaudible]
- Too afraid to look me in the eye?

33:41.270 --> 33:42.438
Present arms.

33:47.860 --> 33:49.654
[music continues]

33:52.448 --> 33:55.492
Just in case Dad's potion doesn't work.

33:55.577 --> 33:57.369
[music continues]

34:13.135 --> 34:14.303
[music inaudible]

34:14.386 --> 34:15.387
Jessica.

34:15.471 --> 34:17.264
[music continues]

34:17.348 --> 34:20.560
- I demand that you show me your face...
- [alarm blaring]

34:22.812 --> 34:24.438
[music inaudible]

34:26.065 --> 34:28.735
Oh, for God's sake, it's Patsy!

34:35.742 --> 34:37.201
Shoot her!

34:53.676 --> 34:55.302
Goodbye, Jessica.

34:58.640 --> 35:00.432
[gunshots continue]

35:08.399 --> 35:09.639
[officer] I'm right behind you.

35:13.279 --> 35:15.031
[guns clicking]

35:15.114 --> 35:16.365
[officer] Go, go!

35:30.129 --> 35:31.380
[grunts]

35:34.175 --> 35:35.760
[gunshots continue]

35:56.698 --> 35:57.907
[gasps]

36:27.311 --> 36:28.938
Unbelievable.

36:29.021 --> 36:30.898
Ready the yacht.

36:35.945 --> 36:37.529
[motor revving]

36:39.991 --> 36:41.492
[Kilgrave] Start killing each other.

36:41.575 --> 36:42.952
Now!

36:44.536 --> 36:46.038
[all grunting]

37:37.089 --> 37:39.300
[inhales] Stop!

37:42.303 --> 37:44.596
- [man panting]
- [woman sobbing]

37:57.944 --> 38:00.529
Don't insult my intelligence.
You're faking, aren't you?

38:00.612 --> 38:01.948
Faking what?

38:02.031 --> 38:04.116
Obviously, you have a plan.

38:04.200 --> 38:07.119
Otherwise, you'd have jumped over
them all and I'd be dead, so...

38:07.870 --> 38:09.246
do share.

38:10.331 --> 38:12.624
I wanted you to make them stop.

38:12.708 --> 38:14.626
Bollocks, killing me would
accomplish that, wouldn't it?

38:14.710 --> 38:17.129
You've never died before.

38:18.505 --> 38:20.049
Always a sodding hero, aren't you?

38:21.258 --> 38:22.634
No.

38:25.554 --> 38:26.680
[chuckles]

38:29.016 --> 38:31.310
Clever girl. Clever, clever girl.

38:32.519 --> 38:34.438
Pretending to give me what I want.

38:35.314 --> 38:36.648
[chuckles]

38:37.733 --> 38:39.026
I'd hoped for it.

38:41.320 --> 38:42.738
[sighs heavily]

38:42.822 --> 38:45.449
God, it is so tempting...

38:45.532 --> 38:47.451
to buy into this act.

39:00.714 --> 39:03.550
I've been asking the impossible of you.

39:03.634 --> 39:05.052
I see that now.

39:07.346 --> 39:09.348
I wanted you to love me.

39:11.350 --> 39:14.728
But you've never loved anyone.
You're not even capable of it.

39:14.811 --> 39:16.313
With one exception.

39:17.814 --> 39:19.233
Come here, Patsy.

39:32.079 --> 39:34.248
You'd do anything to
protect her, wouldn't you?

39:35.582 --> 39:37.376
Yes.

39:39.045 --> 39:41.088
Yeah, perhaps I chose the wrong sister.

39:42.298 --> 39:43.424
Hmm?

39:46.635 --> 39:49.638
From your perspective, I'll
be raping her every day.

39:52.016 --> 39:54.226
My skin will be touching hers.

39:56.770 --> 39:58.689
She'll be my plaything.

40:01.108 --> 40:02.526
She'll be my slave.

40:04.736 --> 40:06.155
[sighs]

40:06.238 --> 40:09.116
And in her mind, she'll be
dying, isn't that right?

40:09.200 --> 40:10.659
Yes.

40:14.914 --> 40:16.207
[Kilgrave] We're leaving.

40:18.084 --> 40:20.877
If Patsy or I ever hear
from you, or see you,

40:20.962 --> 40:22.838
see anyone who looks like you,

40:22.922 --> 40:25.049
she will slit her own throat.

40:25.967 --> 40:28.094
It's the ultimate contingency.

40:33.307 --> 40:34.516
Kiss me.

40:34.600 --> 40:36.185
Mean it.

40:53.244 --> 40:55.621
Oh, God, it's true, isn't it?

41:02.086 --> 41:05.131
You would let me take
your beloved sister.

41:08.425 --> 41:09.635
My God.

41:11.137 --> 41:14.098
It's finally over. You're mine now.

41:14.181 --> 41:17.268
No more fighting. [stammers] No
more of these ugly displays.

41:17.351 --> 41:18.852
You'll be with me now.

41:23.232 --> 41:25.985
Look, after a while...

41:26.068 --> 41:29.030
however long it takes... I know...

41:29.113 --> 41:31.490
I know you will feel what I feel.

41:34.035 --> 41:35.744
Let's start with a smile.

41:37.204 --> 41:38.289
[Kilgrave chuckles]

41:44.795 --> 41:46.380
Tell me you love me.

41:49.675 --> 41:50.842
I love you.

41:54.971 --> 41:56.223
[gasps]

41:58.142 --> 41:59.268
[gasps]

42:03.147 --> 42:04.690
Smile.

42:04.773 --> 42:06.067
[grunts]

42:11.572 --> 42:12.948
[gasping]

42:53.155 --> 42:54.323
[groans]

42:55.241 --> 42:56.533
[Luke grunts]

42:57.951 --> 42:59.453
Go slow.

43:04.625 --> 43:06.460
I'm a friend of Jessica's.

43:08.670 --> 43:10.464
[Luke] How did I get here?

43:10.547 --> 43:11.632
[Claire] Jessica.

43:11.715 --> 43:13.217
Well, I helped.

43:13.300 --> 43:14.760
[Luke sighs]

43:14.843 --> 43:16.095
Where is she?

43:17.221 --> 43:18.639
[Claire] She's been arrested.

43:20.307 --> 43:22.559
She killed someone.
It's all over the news.

43:23.852 --> 43:24.936
[sighs]

43:25.854 --> 43:26.938
She...

43:28.357 --> 43:30.066
- He got to her.
- No, no, no.

43:30.151 --> 43:32.236
She got to him.

43:32.319 --> 43:33.612
Kilgrave is dead.

43:38.033 --> 43:39.201
[scoffs]

43:41.120 --> 43:42.704
[exhales deeply]

43:44.331 --> 43:45.541
She did it.

43:46.542 --> 43:48.043
Yeah, she did it.

43:51.588 --> 43:52.881
They can lock her up for that.

43:52.964 --> 43:54.883
- I won't let that happen.
- Okay. Okay, enough.

43:54.966 --> 43:57.761
She saves you, you save her,
then she has to save you again.

43:57.844 --> 44:00.222
And neither one of you
want to be saved, right?

44:01.973 --> 44:03.225
[groans]

44:08.814 --> 44:10.982
The police... they're looking for me.

44:11.066 --> 44:13.109
But you're the least of their worries.

44:13.194 --> 44:15.862
After we got you out of the
hospital, the place went nuts.

44:15.946 --> 44:18.532
Then down on the docks, some
people went batshit crazy,

44:18.615 --> 44:20.033
including the cops.

44:20.116 --> 44:22.703
Trust me, no one's looking for you.

44:22.786 --> 44:24.705
Nobody knows about you.

44:24.788 --> 44:25.997
Except me.

44:26.081 --> 44:27.708
What do you know?

44:30.377 --> 44:31.920
I know how to keep a secret.

44:34.756 --> 44:35.924
[sighs]

44:36.883 --> 44:38.719
[Claire] You know, Jessica...

44:38.802 --> 44:40.637
she's a good friend to have.

44:42.806 --> 44:45.309
She's all tough and shit, but
where you're concerned...

44:45.392 --> 44:46.852
She's still tough and shit.

44:48.645 --> 44:50.481
Yeah.

44:50.564 --> 44:52.023
You're two of a kind.

44:57.863 --> 44:59.323
I could use some water.

45:03.660 --> 45:07.331
You know, that should make you happy.
Somebody caring about you like that.

45:08.332 --> 45:10.166
Particularly if you feel the same way.

45:10.251 --> 45:13.003
Not that it's any of
my business, but...

45:13.086 --> 45:15.046
I don't know...

45:15.130 --> 45:18.509
this might be something
you want to work through.

45:20.969 --> 45:22.554
See what's possible.

45:33.857 --> 45:35.108
[sighs]

45:35.942 --> 45:38.612
Jessica Jones didn't ask for this.

45:38.695 --> 45:40.864
She didn't go looking for it.

45:40.947 --> 45:42.533
This monster found her.

45:42.616 --> 45:44.743
[woman] She killed a man
with her bare hands, Jeri.

45:44.826 --> 45:47.078
And it's not the first death
she's been linked to.

45:47.162 --> 45:48.289
Now we have witnesses.

45:48.372 --> 45:51.458
All of whom will testify that he
forced them to try to kill each other.

45:51.542 --> 45:55.086
They were a bunch of drunken
brawlers off a booze cruise.

45:55.170 --> 45:57.130
[Hogarth] Come on, Samantha.

45:57.213 --> 46:00.509
You must have tested their
blood alcohol levels.

46:00.592 --> 46:01.760
Try this one.

46:03.053 --> 46:05.889
They were exposed to a toxic gas leak.

46:05.972 --> 46:09.351
Or there's something in the
water, or subliminal advertising.

46:09.435 --> 46:13.689
I had dozens of justifications, I
just didn't want to believe it.

46:14.398 --> 46:18.360
Even as more people were hurt...
or killed.

46:18.444 --> 46:20.446
Are you testifying, Jeri?

46:20.529 --> 46:22.573
No, no need.

46:22.656 --> 46:26.368
I will have more than enough
testimony to convince a jury

46:26.452 --> 46:31.081
that this man forced Jessica
to snap his own neck.

46:31.164 --> 46:35.251
[Samantha] That's your defense?
He committed suicide?

46:35.836 --> 46:37.212
Guilt.

46:37.295 --> 46:39.631
The guilt was un... unbearable.

46:39.715 --> 46:43.635
He couldn't live with all the pain...
that he had caused.

46:43.719 --> 46:47.348
Either way, Jessica did
not have a choice.

46:47.431 --> 46:49.975
She was compelled against her will.

46:50.058 --> 46:54.688
And this same man compelled
an innocent young woman...

46:54.771 --> 46:56.482
to kill her own parents.

46:56.565 --> 47:01.277
If I had these same witnesses, Hope
Shlottman would be alive today.

47:02.613 --> 47:06.575
Witness testimony won't prove
the existence of mind control.

47:06.658 --> 47:10.496
Tell that to the police officers
who opened fire on my client.

47:10.579 --> 47:12.539
I can't wait to get them on the stand.

47:15.376 --> 47:17.919
Anything to add, Ms. Jones?

47:20.881 --> 47:23.091
[Jessica] <i>They say
everyone's born a hero.</i>

47:27.929 --> 47:29.222
<i>But if you let it,</i>

47:29.305 --> 47:32.976
<i>life will push you over the
line until you're the villain.</i>

47:52.370 --> 47:53.622
Thank you.

47:56.792 --> 47:59.670
[door opens and closes]

48:00.295 --> 48:03.549
[Jessica] <i>Problem is, you don't always
know that you've crossed that line.</i>

[stammering] <i>My boyfriend has gotten...
abusive,</i>

49:47.360 --> 49:48.987
<i>and I don't know who to turn to.</i>

49:57.871 --> 50:00.749
[woman 3 sobbing] <i>Jessica,
you have to save me!</i>

50:04.753 --> 50:07.756
[Jessica] <i>Maybe it's enough that
the world thinks I'm a hero.</i>

50:07.839 --> 50:09.215
[phone ringing]

50:10.383 --> 50:13.011
<i>Maybe if I work long and hard...</i>
