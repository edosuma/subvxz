00:25.692 --> 00:27.626
[Man]
Mr. Maleeni.

00:27.694 --> 00:29.855
Hey, guy.
You ready to rumble?

00:29.929 --> 00:33.763
If by "rumble" you mean perform,
yes, I am.

00:33.833 --> 00:37.462
Cool. You know how he said
you get 125 for the day?

00:37.537 --> 00:40.472
It's gonna be 75 instead.
The gate's for crap.

00:40.540 --> 00:43.737
But, hey, the show's
gotta go on, right?

00:43.810 --> 00:47.769
- This will be my greatest show ever.
- Right on.

00:48.681 --> 00:52.048
[Applause]

00:52.118 --> 00:54.643
Ladies and gentlemen,
damas y caballeros,

00:54.721 --> 00:58.817
I aim today not just
to entertain but to educate,

00:58.892 --> 01:03.625
to instruct and inform
in the venerable...

01:03.696 --> 01:07.462
- and ancient history of my art.
- [Slurping]

01:07.534 --> 01:09.695
UntilJohann Nepomuk Hofsinzer...

01:09.769 --> 01:12.795
called playing cards
the poetry of magic,

01:12.872 --> 01:17.400
a conjuror's skill was determined
entirely by his ability...

01:17.477 --> 01:19.945
to perform one effect.

01:20.013 --> 01:23.312
That effect was known
as the cups and balls.

01:23.383 --> 01:27.251
The games were known for hundreds,
if not thousands of years.

01:27.320 --> 01:31.120
Perhaps the greatest performer
was the Italian Bartolomeo Bosco.

01:31.191 --> 01:34.160
Get on with it.

01:37.263 --> 01:41.723
Bosco's passes
with the cups and balls.

01:44.270 --> 01:46.204
Wah-day...

01:49.109 --> 01:51.043
chubio...

01:53.880 --> 01:55.814
colerader.

01:55.882 --> 01:57.816
Three gone...

01:57.884 --> 02:01.684
and yet three... return.

02:01.754 --> 02:03.847
Bosco had only one
contemporary rival,

02:03.923 --> 02:08.053
a slightly older Frenchman named Conus,
who announced in 1795...

02:08.127 --> 02:12.724
that he would make his wife,
who was five-foot seven,
appear under one of the cups.

02:12.799 --> 02:16.860
Practice though I have,
I have been unable even to get married.

02:16.936 --> 02:20.064
[Sarcastic Laughing]

02:20.140 --> 02:23.701
Conus placed one ball in his pocket.

02:23.776 --> 02:26.244
He put the second ball away.

02:26.312 --> 02:29.475
Putting the third ball in his hand,
he made it vanish,

02:29.549 --> 02:31.483
and that's the mystery...

02:31.551 --> 02:35.578
of the cups and the balls.

02:38.758 --> 02:42.751
Yo! Can't you do anything
that ain't a hundred years old?

02:42.829 --> 02:46.321
That ain't old school,
that's decrepit.

02:46.399 --> 02:49.459
Young man, shall I come
heckle you on your job?

02:49.536 --> 02:52.994
Make sure you count out
the requisite number of McNuggets?

02:53.072 --> 02:56.166
Show me somethin'.

02:56.242 --> 02:59.541
Come on.
Show me somethin'.

03:02.248 --> 03:07.015
A callow challenge to be met
by experience and skill.

03:07.086 --> 03:10.385
To wit,
the Egyptian Dedi,

03:10.456 --> 03:13.016
whose most
celebrated feat...

03:13.092 --> 03:16.357
was to reattach
a recently severed head,

03:16.429 --> 03:20.058
reuniting it with
the still-warm body...

03:20.133 --> 03:22.693
and no harm done.

03:22.769 --> 03:24.862
Western history knows...

03:24.938 --> 03:27.907
three previous attempts
at recreating...

03:27.974 --> 03:30.738
this Noachian feat,

03:30.810 --> 03:34.906
each of the three
ending in tragedy.

03:34.981 --> 03:37.973
This will be the fourth.

03:38.051 --> 03:41.817
May I have complete silence,
please?

03:55.702 --> 03:58.398
- [Crowd Hooting, Whistling]
- Yeah!

03:58.471 --> 04:02.464
Senor Maleeni!
Ho ho!

04:02.542 --> 04:06.740
[Man On P.A.] Folks, let's give it up
for the Amazing Maleeni.

04:12.585 --> 04:17.180
Guy, you rock. That kicked ass.
I mean, it looked completely real.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.248
How did you do that?

04:19.325 --> 04:21.815
Oh, yeah, right.
Magic.

04:24.297 --> 04:26.390
Oh, hey, your money.
Hold up.

04:29.235 --> 04:34.298
Two, four, fifty, fifty-five, sixty,
sixty-five, seventy, seventy-five.

04:34.374 --> 04:37.866
You earned it.
Mr. Maleeni?

04:39.712 --> 04:42.613
[Clears Throat]
Mr. Maleeni.

04:45.718 --> 04:48.312
Oh, God! Oh...
[Panting]

05:42.474 --> 05:44.408
Whew.

05:49.581 --> 05:54.348
- Neat trick, huh?
- I can think of a neater one...

05:54.419 --> 05:58.048
how you convinced me to drop everything
and get on the first plane
to Los Angeles.

05:58.123 --> 06:00.853
Come on, Scully.
This isn't intriguing enough for you?

06:00.925 --> 06:04.759
A magician turns his head
completely around, 360 degrees,

06:04.829 --> 06:06.888
to the delight of young and old alike,

06:06.965 --> 06:10.332
after which it plops
unceremoniously onto the pier.

06:10.402 --> 06:13.769
- See the picture?
- Yeah, I saw the picture.

06:13.838 --> 06:17.069
And as for this Amazing Maleeni
turning his head all the way around...

06:17.142 --> 06:19.235
Like you said, Mulder, neat trick.

06:19.310 --> 06:24.270
- But?
- But... I'd guess this event...

06:24.349 --> 06:27.341
was completely removed
from his subsequent murder.

06:27.419 --> 06:30.820
- You think this was a murder?
- Don't you?

06:30.889 --> 06:33.119
Mulder, his head was cut off.

06:33.191 --> 06:36.422
Ah. Observe the nearly
complete absence of blood.

06:36.494 --> 06:40.624
Observe the paucity of fingerprints,
as evidenced by the L.A.P.D.'s
liberal use...

06:40.698 --> 06:44.156
- of lycopodium powder.
- Why are you talking like Tony Randall?

06:44.235 --> 06:47.898
Know that the Amazing Maleeni was alive
one moment and expired the next.

06:47.972 --> 06:52.238
Know also that no one
saw his fleeing attacker,
nor heard the dying man's cries.

06:52.310 --> 06:54.778
Mulder, I admit that I
don't know how it happened,

06:54.846 --> 06:58.304
but I still say that it was a murder.

06:58.383 --> 07:02.945
- So what's your theory?
- A magic trick gone horribly wrong.

07:03.021 --> 07:05.182
One that claims the lives
of all who attempt it.

07:05.256 --> 07:07.850
Can I see that camcorder again?

07:09.360 --> 07:11.351
Thank you.

07:11.429 --> 07:14.262
A tourist videotaped...

07:14.332 --> 07:16.266
Maleeni's performance.

07:18.303 --> 07:20.237
This...

07:21.406 --> 07:24.603
That ain't old school, that's decrepit.

07:24.676 --> 07:26.507
- [Heckler] Show me somethin'.
- Who's the heckler?

07:26.578 --> 07:29.445
Come on. Show me somethin'.

07:29.514 --> 07:32.108
I don't know.

07:35.987 --> 07:37.921
[Scully Scoffs]

07:39.858 --> 07:42.656
Neat trick, huh?

07:42.727 --> 07:44.991
Hang on a second. Let me see this.

07:48.867 --> 07:51.995
That heckler's pretty hard to impress,
wouldn't you say?

07:53.805 --> 07:56.069
Look at him.
He just takes off in a huff.

07:56.141 --> 08:00.475
- You think he's a murderer?
- It's worth checking out,
don't you think?

08:00.545 --> 08:04.174
I don't know. That'd be a neat trick
in itself. You never see his face.

08:04.249 --> 08:06.410
Ah! But observe.

08:09.154 --> 08:11.452
His discarded soda cup.

08:11.523 --> 08:14.356
The hand may be quicker than the eye,
but it still leaves fngerprints.

08:14.425 --> 08:18.156
- Provided they haven't dumped the trash.
- Skeptic.

08:27.939 --> 08:29.873
[Clinking]

08:31.743 --> 08:33.677
[Scully]
Mr. LaBonge?

08:34.879 --> 08:37.506
We're agents Mulder and Scully
from the F.B.I.

08:39.918 --> 08:43.876
Were you at the Santa Monica Pier
yesterday morning?

08:43.955 --> 08:45.889
Yeah.

08:45.957 --> 08:49.393
[Mulder] You attended a magic show,
the Amazing Maleeni?

08:50.461 --> 08:52.395
Yeah, he sucks.
Why?

08:52.463 --> 08:56.263
He's dead, under extremely
suspicious circumstances.

08:57.635 --> 08:59.569
He still sucks.

08:59.637 --> 09:04.006
- How'd you find me?
- Your fingerprints.

09:04.075 --> 09:08.375
- You have a criminal record.
- A conviction for pickpocketing.

09:08.446 --> 09:13.247
[Sighs] Man, that was performance art.
Besides, it's ancient history.

09:13.318 --> 09:15.616
What are you saying?
You think I killed him?

09:15.687 --> 09:18.952
Well, you're on videotape
heckling the deceased.

09:19.023 --> 09:21.253
What did you have against
Mr. Maleeni?

09:26.030 --> 09:29.295
First of all,
his name's not Maleeni.

09:30.368 --> 09:32.563
That's the name
of a real magician,

09:32.637 --> 09:35.128
a guy at the turn of the century,
Max Malini.

09:35.206 --> 09:37.299
- Ever hear of him?
- No.

09:37.375 --> 09:39.468
It's too bad.
You should've.

09:39.544 --> 09:42.570
Anyway, he steals his name,
spells it a little differently...

09:42.647 --> 09:45.673
and he does some tired crap
that wouldn't cut it
at a kid's birthday party.

09:45.750 --> 09:49.413
What about the trick where he
turns his head completely around?

09:49.487 --> 09:51.421
Check it out.

10:00.932 --> 10:02.866
[Cracking]

10:18.716 --> 10:21.207
[Chuckles]

10:23.788 --> 10:27.986
No problem.
Did you like that?

10:28.059 --> 10:30.186
- Yeah.
- Watch.

10:34.098 --> 10:36.794
A coin in the hand...
blows away.

10:38.403 --> 10:40.462
Maybe it's a little bit
hard for you to see.

10:41.973 --> 10:46.000
Let me make that...
bigger for you.

10:46.077 --> 10:50.070
Great, but I don't see how
they're any different or better
than the ones Maleeni did.

10:50.148 --> 10:52.514
Mozart and Salieri.

10:53.685 --> 10:57.553
They sound pretty much
the same to a layman.

10:57.622 --> 11:01.422
But they ain't.
You know what I'm sayin'?

11:03.928 --> 11:06.488
It's about originality.

11:08.099 --> 11:10.260
Style.

11:12.603 --> 11:15.163
And more than
anything else...

11:15.239 --> 11:18.072
soul.

11:18.142 --> 11:21.407
Because that's what separates
the great ones...

11:22.080 --> 11:24.014
from the hacks.

11:25.983 --> 11:30.010
We can't do this halfway. We're dealing
with powerful forces at work here.

11:30.088 --> 11:33.956
Energies far beyond
our mere...

11:34.025 --> 11:38.257
mortal... understanding.

11:39.530 --> 11:42.021
Enough to make a magician
lose his head?

11:42.100 --> 11:44.625
Could be.

11:46.471 --> 11:49.634
That, and I hear Maleeni racked up
some pretty big gambling debts.

11:51.676 --> 11:54.201
Who knows who he
might've pissed off.

11:54.278 --> 11:57.907
Thank you, Mr. LaBonge.
We'll, uh, be in touch.

11:57.982 --> 12:00.917
Please do.
Oh, and agents?

12:17.034 --> 12:19.434
Mozart and Salieri.
Which one's which?

12:19.504 --> 12:21.665
Mulder, I think that
professional jealousy...

12:21.739 --> 12:23.832
is as good a motive
for murder as any.

12:23.908 --> 12:26.172
If it was a murder.
I'm not convinced.

12:27.812 --> 12:29.905
If I can get Mr. Maleeni
into an autopsy bay,

12:29.981 --> 12:32.415
hopefully we can put this issue
to rest as soon as possible.

12:37.188 --> 12:40.521
All right, I'm stumped.
I think I'm supposed to be.

12:41.993 --> 12:44.359
- What do you think?
- Well, first of all,

12:44.429 --> 12:47.330
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but Mr. Maleeni's head...

12:47.398 --> 12:49.593
didn't just
magically fall off.

12:49.667 --> 12:52.295
It was very
carefully sawed.

12:52.370 --> 12:55.032
Very slow
and exacting work,

12:55.106 --> 12:57.768
probably with
a fine-tooth meat saw.

12:57.842 --> 13:00.333
And check out
this little detail.

13:03.214 --> 13:06.445
Spirit gum, Mulder.

13:06.517 --> 13:09.350
It held the head
to the body.

13:09.420 --> 13:12.878
- Just barely, of course.
- So he was murdered?

13:12.957 --> 13:17.155
Well, no. As far as I can tell, this man
died of advanced coronary disease.

13:17.228 --> 13:20.629
- Natural causes.
- Yeah.

13:20.698 --> 13:23.565
So basically, he died of a heart attack,
somebody crept up behind him,
sawed his head off...

13:23.634 --> 13:26.501
and then glued it back on all in
the space of 30 seconds. [Chuckles]

13:26.571 --> 13:28.904
- Does that make sense to you?
- No.

13:29.037 --> 13:31.870
Which makes it
even stranger still,

13:31.940 --> 13:33.999
because as far
as I can tell...

13:34.075 --> 13:36.976
this body has been dead
for over a month.

13:37.045 --> 13:39.206
I see signs
of refrigeration.

13:39.281 --> 13:41.374
And yet he performed yesterday.

13:42.884 --> 13:46.479
- What a trouper.
- Well, somebody performed yesterday.

13:52.394 --> 13:54.828
##[Hard Rock]

14:11.346 --> 14:13.780
Cissy Alvarez.

14:13.848 --> 14:17.648
Who are you?

14:17.719 --> 14:22.281
You don't remember me.
Ain't that a bitch?

14:22.357 --> 14:27.351
My name's LaBonge. I did time
with you about eight years ago.

14:27.429 --> 14:31.889
- You were in for bank robbery.
- The name doesn't mean anything.
What do you want?

14:31.967 --> 14:34.128
I hear you're
a poker player.

14:34.202 --> 14:37.296
You won big off a guy who
calls himself the Amazing Maleeni.

14:37.372 --> 14:40.398
Also goes by the name
of Herman Pinchbeck.

14:43.478 --> 14:46.572
- Pinchbeck?
- He's dead.

14:46.648 --> 14:48.843
Yeah, I saw in the paper.

14:48.917 --> 14:52.478
Something about his head fell off.
Yeah. What's it to you?

14:54.456 --> 14:57.755
I'm the guy that
made his head fall off.

15:00.395 --> 15:03.660
You took his marker, right?
What'd he owe you, 15 grand?

15:03.732 --> 15:07.429
- Twenty.
- I don't think he was
ever gonna pay you back.

15:07.502 --> 15:09.595
You want to cut
to the chase?

15:09.671 --> 15:12.162
You know, get a little more of your
story out before we stomp you to death?

15:12.240 --> 15:16.802
How would you like to get back
what you're owed times ten?

15:16.878 --> 15:19.847
200,000. Mm. How?

15:19.914 --> 15:22.940
- Helping me.
- Do what?

15:23.018 --> 15:24.451
Magic.

15:43.338 --> 15:45.272
Wanna hear more?

16:11.866 --> 16:14.858
Excuse me. I'm looking
for Mr. Albert Pinchbeck.

16:14.936 --> 16:17.905
- He's the gentleman right over there.
The poor man.
- Ah.

16:26.114 --> 16:29.481
- He look familiar to you, Scully?
- He certainly does.

16:32.420 --> 16:35.617
- The plot thickens.
- He might try and run.

16:38.560 --> 16:41.427
Come in.

16:41.496 --> 16:47.093
- Good morning, Mr. And Mrs...
- Agents Mulder and Scully, F.B.I.

16:47.168 --> 16:50.365
You're not here for a home loan,
I take it.

16:50.438 --> 16:53.339
No. We are investigating
the death of a magician...

16:53.408 --> 16:55.501
who called himself
the Amazing Maleeni.

16:55.577 --> 16:58.341
Herman Pinchbeck,
my twin brother.

16:58.413 --> 17:01.541
Yes, we know.
We checked his next of kin.

17:01.616 --> 17:04.517
- What happened to your neck,
Mr. Pinchbeck?
- I was in a car accident.

17:04.586 --> 17:07.384
Car accident.

17:07.454 --> 17:10.083
So your injured neck has nothing
to do with a magic trick...

17:10.157 --> 17:12.148
you performed at the Santa Monica Pier
two days ago,

17:12.227 --> 17:15.252
one which involved you turning your head
around 360 degrees?

17:15.329 --> 17:17.958
Well, no.
That wasn't me.

17:18.031 --> 17:20.296
I was in a bad car accident
in Mexico.

17:20.367 --> 17:23.428
A bad Mexican car accident
in Mexico.

17:23.505 --> 17:27.464
- Do you know magic, Mr. Pinchbeck?
- Yes, I do.

17:27.541 --> 17:30.807
Back in the '70s,
my brother and I performed together.

17:30.879 --> 17:33.746
- Why'd you stop?
- You never really stop.

17:35.150 --> 17:37.084
[Drawer Slides]

17:41.956 --> 17:44.322
[Mulder]
Pick a card, any card?

17:56.304 --> 17:58.238
[Clears Throat]

18:08.082 --> 18:10.175
[Mulder]
Hmm.

18:10.251 --> 18:13.516
- Very impressive.
- My brother and I both wanted to do...

18:13.588 --> 18:17.024
the absolute best magic
the world had ever seen.

18:17.091 --> 18:19.286
The difference was,
I knew we'd never get there,

18:19.360 --> 18:21.453
but he always
believed we would.

18:21.529 --> 18:24.987
We didn't talk much
after I quit the act.

18:25.066 --> 18:29.526
I have a theory, Mr. Pinchbeck,
and I'm gonna tell you how it goes.

18:31.539 --> 18:33.871
I think that your brother Herman
died of heart disease...

18:33.942 --> 18:36.274
having never made it as
the world's greatest magician.

18:36.344 --> 18:39.871
I think that hurt you, just as
your estrangement from him hurt you.

18:39.948 --> 18:43.611
I think what you did was perform
his last act for him.

18:43.685 --> 18:46.552
One last act for which
he'd always be remembered.

18:46.621 --> 18:49.954
One last act that would end with
such a shock, such a denouement,

18:50.024 --> 18:52.857
as would be forever remembered
in the annals of magic.

18:55.530 --> 18:57.964
That's what I think.

18:59.434 --> 19:01.527
I so wish that were true.

19:11.980 --> 19:14.574
It was a very bad car accident
in Mexico.

19:20.455 --> 19:22.889
- Oy!
- No kidding.

19:23.958 --> 19:25.892
What now?

19:25.960 --> 19:28.520
A guy's head falls off,
it's the greatest trick in the world.

19:28.596 --> 19:30.689
When there's no
discernible point to it,

19:30.765 --> 19:33.029
what's the reason for doing
that in the first place?

19:33.101 --> 19:37.834
Well, why do people do magic? To
impress, to delight, to gain attention.

19:37.905 --> 19:40.430
Well, this one's gaining
mostly police attention.

19:42.143 --> 19:44.077
Maybe that's the point.

19:45.380 --> 19:47.746
Well, maybe we should
consult an expert...

19:47.815 --> 19:52.218
someone who knows magic, who's seen
the greatest trick in the world.

19:52.287 --> 19:54.448
Maybe he can help us
figure that out.

19:54.522 --> 19:56.581
- Mozart.
- Yeah.

19:56.658 --> 19:58.592
What's in it for me?

19:58.660 --> 20:02.255
I mean, let's say I help you out.
What do I get in return?

20:04.198 --> 20:08.601
The feeling of pride that comes
from performing your civic duty?

20:08.670 --> 20:11.366
[Mulder]
How 'bout the chance...

20:11.439 --> 20:15.569
to root through the professional secrets
of your least favorite magician?

20:17.278 --> 20:19.371
Good for a laugh, I guess.

20:40.601 --> 20:42.694
Man, it's worse
than I thought.

20:47.675 --> 20:50.803
You gotta feed those things,
you know.

20:50.878 --> 20:52.812
So...

20:55.850 --> 20:59.115
- Maleeni wasn't murdered.
- It would seem not.

20:59.187 --> 21:02.486
So someone impersonated him
and his crappy act.

21:02.557 --> 21:04.582
It's impressive.

21:10.498 --> 21:12.762
I'd say the twin brother did it,
but I don't think...

21:12.834 --> 21:15.029
he's any better a magician
than Maleeni was.

21:15.103 --> 21:18.800
There's that,
and he's got no legs.

21:21.075 --> 21:22.408
Yeah. Whatever.

21:22.408 --> 21:24.171
Yeah. Whatever.

21:24.243 --> 21:29.340
Anyway, we're looking for a magician
with the same height and build.

21:29.415 --> 21:32.680
A good makeup job and the right wig,
and no one would know the difference.

21:32.751 --> 21:34.981
Not even you, I guess.

21:35.053 --> 21:37.351
I had a couple of
Jell-O shots in me.

21:37.423 --> 21:40.984
Hey, how did this impersonator
switch out the dead body?

21:41.059 --> 21:46.326
With ease. You're gonna kick yourselves
when I show you how he did this,
it's so simple.

21:46.398 --> 21:51.665
Because magic is all about...
misdirection.

21:53.639 --> 21:57.769
Your impersonator simply made sure
everyone was looking the other way...

21:57.843 --> 22:02.143
when he pulled Maleeni's body
from its secret hiding place...

22:02.214 --> 22:04.148
underneath...

22:05.217 --> 22:07.151
the floor.

22:22.234 --> 22:24.168
[Sighs]

22:28.607 --> 22:32.168
Man, this guy's good.

22:33.745 --> 22:36.942
Well, thanks for
your expert opinion.

22:37.015 --> 22:40.109
I guess we're right back
where we started.

22:40.185 --> 22:42.915
Maybe not.

22:42.988 --> 22:46.355
You said that, uh, the Amazing Maleeni
had some gambling debts?

22:46.425 --> 22:48.450
Yeah, that's what I heard.

22:48.527 --> 22:50.859
Check this out.
Looks like a marker.

22:50.929 --> 22:53.295
$20,000. Pinchbeck.

22:56.668 --> 22:59.432
What would this be doing
in Maleeni's van?

23:12.851 --> 23:15.319
[Guard]
Thank you, Mr. Pinchbeck.

23:15.387 --> 23:17.878
If you could
sign here for me.

23:17.956 --> 23:19.890
With pleasure.

23:22.127 --> 23:27.224
- Anthony, what kind of gun is that?
- Glock 17,.9 millimeter.

23:27.299 --> 23:29.927
I've been thinking of maybe
buying one since my accident.

23:30.002 --> 23:32.470
Well, here. Take a look.

23:37.075 --> 23:39.009
Hmm.

23:39.077 --> 23:42.308
- Gosh, it's heavier
than I would've thought.
- [Chuckles]

23:45.918 --> 23:48.648
Thank you,
Anthony, Marvin.

23:48.720 --> 23:50.847
- If you ever want,
I'll take you to the shooting range.
- [Clip Clicks]

23:50.923 --> 23:53.357
- Hmm.
- Have a good one, Mr. Pinchbeck.

23:53.425 --> 23:55.359
You too.

24:08.840 --> 24:11.104
Hello, may I help you?

24:17.783 --> 24:20.877
- Damn, you look just like him.
- I'm sorry?

24:20.953 --> 24:24.081
Your no-good,
malapaga brother...

24:24.156 --> 24:26.488
died owing me money...

24:26.558 --> 24:28.958
a lot of money.

24:29.027 --> 24:31.120
- You're gonna make good.
- I'm sorry,

24:31.196 --> 24:33.721
but my, uh, brother's debts
are his own.

24:35.801 --> 24:40.295
I said,
you're gonna make good,

24:40.372 --> 24:42.738
'cause me and my friends,
we know where you live.

24:56.588 --> 24:59.022
[Clattering]

25:01.360 --> 25:04.329
- That sound like the rear diff?
- Pull over.

25:09.501 --> 25:12.402
Stay here and call it in.
I'll check it out.

25:12.471 --> 25:15.838
We got a problem with the rear diff.
We're on Fourth and Main.

25:15.907 --> 25:18.000
Checking it out is Anthony.

25:34.292 --> 25:38.126
You! In the truck!
Get up where I can see you.

25:38.196 --> 25:41.188
Hands where
I can see them!

25:41.266 --> 25:43.598
Up! Hands up.

25:43.669 --> 25:45.694
All right. Get out.

25:45.771 --> 25:47.966
Mister, get out...

25:49.875 --> 25:53.106
Hey, I got a guy down
back here!

25:57.783 --> 26:00.809
It was a guy with tattoos!
I shot him four times!

26:03.655 --> 26:07.147
I don't understand.
He was right here.

26:24.309 --> 26:26.573
[Scully]
It's your handwriting, is it not?

26:30.248 --> 26:32.739
Mr. Alvarez,
please answer the question.

26:32.818 --> 26:35.753
That ain't mine.
I don't know where you got that.

26:35.821 --> 26:38.085
It's interesting.
Yours are the only fingerprints on it.

26:38.156 --> 26:41.592
[Scully] We ran it through the
California Criminal History Database,

26:41.660 --> 26:44.356
to which you seem to be
quite well known.

26:44.429 --> 26:46.761
So it's my marker.

26:46.832 --> 26:51.201
So Pinchbeck owed me money.
It was a friendly game of poker.

26:51.269 --> 26:55.296
Very friendly.
$20,000 friendly.

26:55.373 --> 26:59.469
- Where did you find that?
- In Herman Pinchbeck's van.

27:01.246 --> 27:03.180
Where were you
last Thursday?

27:03.248 --> 27:06.809
Here. All day. Ask 'em.

27:10.522 --> 27:13.855
What is it you think I did
to Pinchbeck, huh?

27:13.925 --> 27:18.453
What's in it for me?
If I kill him, he ain't gonna pay me.

27:18.530 --> 27:22.022
Why did you play with him
in the first place?
You knew he was a professional magician.

27:22.100 --> 27:24.466
I didn't know what he was.

27:24.536 --> 27:27.369
And he sure as hell
couldn't play worth a damn.

27:27.439 --> 27:29.498
Don't leave town,
Mr. Alvarez.

27:41.820 --> 27:45.449
Don't you find it odd that the
Amazing Maleeni's a lousy poker player?

27:45.524 --> 27:49.585
- This is a guy who's adept
at manipulating cards.
- Maybe he wasn't so adept.

27:49.661 --> 27:54.689
- LaBonge certainly doesn't have
a high opinion of his skills.
- There's another possibility.

27:54.766 --> 27:57.860
Behold... an ordinary
household quarter.

27:57.936 --> 28:01.337
I'm going to take the quarter
from my right hand
and place it into my left hand.

28:01.406 --> 28:03.499
- Where is it?
- It's in your right hand.

28:03.575 --> 28:06.009
No, no, no.
Ahh-ahh!

28:06.077 --> 28:08.568
- That's not bad. Mulder...
- Blow your nose, Scully.

28:08.647 --> 28:11.047
- Blow your nose. Come on. Blow.
- Achoo.

28:11.116 --> 28:13.607
- Ta-da! Look at that.
The Great Muldeeni.
- Amazing!

28:13.685 --> 28:17.519
- What's the point?
- Misdirection. It's the heart of magic,
like LaBonge said.

28:17.589 --> 28:19.716
I made you look in one direction,
the quarter went in the other.

28:19.791 --> 28:22.521
That's what you think's
happening in this case?

28:22.594 --> 28:25.392
I think we're being
led around by our noses.

28:25.463 --> 28:29.263
- By whom? Maleeni's already dead.
- It certainly would appear so.

28:29.334 --> 28:32.394
But then again, you thought the quarter
was in the right hand.

28:37.275 --> 28:39.209
[Engine Starts]

28:51.957 --> 28:53.891

- Yeah, hello?

28:56.428 --> 29:00.421
Yeah, I want to report a man with a gun.
He's threatening to kill somebody.

29:00.498 --> 29:04.093
- Can you please speak up?
- No, I can't speak up. No, I can't!

Hey, guys.

29:25.755 --> 29:28.747
- You son of a bitch.
- I'm sorry?

29:28.825 --> 29:31.760
You tried to frame me.
[Swearing In Spanish]

29:31.828 --> 29:34.023
- I didn't!
- Oh, you didn't, huh?
- Wait! We've got a deal!

29:34.097 --> 29:37.430
- We got no deal.
I'm gonna bleed you, you little bitch.
- Back off!

29:43.239 --> 29:46.003
- You're dead.
- [Siren Wails]

29:47.711 --> 29:49.645

29:49.713 --> 29:51.681
Freeze!

29:51.748 --> 29:53.807
Drop your weapon.

Put your hand down.
Spread your legs.

[Keyboard Clacking]

30:11.434 --> 30:14.995
Agents.
An unexpected surprise.

30:15.071 --> 30:18.165
- Good afternoon.
- We'd like to have a word with you,
Mr. Pinchbeck.

30:18.241 --> 30:21.733
- I'm fairly busy, actually.
- I'll bet.

30:21.811 --> 30:24.245
- Hey! What?
- Let's take a little spin, shall we?

30:32.222 --> 30:37.057
- What's this all about?
- It's about misdirection, Mr. Pinchbeck.

30:37.127 --> 30:40.221
Or should I say
the Amazing Maleeni?

30:40.296 --> 30:42.389
Mulder!

30:44.000 --> 30:47.094
It's a trick, Scully.
Voila.

30:47.170 --> 30:49.934
Had you fooled.

30:50.006 --> 30:52.941
- You're Maleeni?
- Call me Herman.

31:02.352 --> 31:04.445
I was afraid for my life.

31:04.521 --> 31:07.388
That's why I did what I did.
I'm not proud of that.

31:07.457 --> 31:12.520
But I owe a lot of money
that I can't possibly pay back.

31:12.595 --> 31:16.395
We know... gambling debts
to a man named Alvarez.

31:16.466 --> 31:18.696
Yeah, that tattooed psychopath.

31:18.768 --> 31:21.032
I've since heard
terrible stories about him,

31:21.104 --> 31:23.538
things he did in prison
to fellow inmates.

31:23.606 --> 31:27.975
- So why'd you play poker with him?
- He runs a good game.

31:28.044 --> 31:32.413
I gamble to supplement my income.
God knows, magic barely pays.

31:32.482 --> 31:36.077
Why did you lose? You could've
manipulated the cards, right?

31:36.152 --> 31:39.781
Cheat? You're asking why
I don't cheat at cards?

31:39.856 --> 31:43.383
- Well, you could, right?
- [Scoffs] Of course, I could.

31:45.595 --> 31:50.464
But how would I live with myself?
Who raised you?

31:51.301 --> 31:53.531
Well, sir,

31:53.603 --> 31:57.039
what does any of this have to do
with your twin brother...

31:57.107 --> 32:00.099
being found decapitated
at the Santa Monica Pier?

32:00.176 --> 32:03.236
I went to my brother
for a loan.

32:03.313 --> 32:05.508
Just my luck and his.

32:05.582 --> 32:08.415
You found him dead
of a heart attack.

32:08.485 --> 32:11.511
His body was still warm.

32:11.588 --> 32:13.818
Looking at him lifeless,

32:13.890 --> 32:18.020
I saw myself,
my own eventual mortality.

32:18.094 --> 32:21.291
I saw all the things I meant
to accomplish but didn't.

32:21.364 --> 32:25.323
It was an opportunity to vanish,
to become someone else.

32:25.401 --> 32:29.201
Like I said,
I'm not proud of what I did.

32:29.272 --> 32:31.968
And so you
refrigerated the body.

32:32.041 --> 32:35.033
I needed time to figure out
how to pull it all off.

32:35.111 --> 32:37.511
Impersonating my brother,
I called the bank,

32:37.580 --> 32:39.844
told them I needed
a vacation week,

32:39.916 --> 32:42.384
a trip to Mexico.

32:42.452 --> 32:45.944
Then the bank received word that
I'd been in a terrible accident.

32:46.022 --> 32:49.048
It gave me plenty of time
away from work.

32:49.125 --> 32:52.219
And you posed
as an amputee...

32:52.295 --> 32:54.957
to allay suspicion that
you weren't your brother.

32:55.031 --> 32:58.194
That, and I rather enjoy
the sympathy,

32:58.268 --> 33:00.668
especially from the women
in our office.

33:05.475 --> 33:08.410
You, uh, still
haven't explained...

33:08.478 --> 33:11.038
why you left your brother's body
at the pier,

33:11.114 --> 33:13.674
or why you arranged to have
his head fall off.

33:13.750 --> 33:18.084
He explained it. He put it
so eloquently when we last spoke.

33:18.154 --> 33:20.520
It was my
final performance.

33:20.590 --> 33:23.889
I wanted to go out with such a shock,
such a denouement,

33:23.960 --> 33:27.896
as would forever be remembered
in the annals of magic.

33:29.566 --> 33:31.534
That was your
last performance.

33:33.269 --> 33:35.203
What's this for?

33:35.271 --> 33:38.832
Well... I still think you've got
a few tricks up your sleeve.

33:50.620 --> 33:52.554
My God.

33:52.622 --> 33:58.026
We gave you handicapped parking.
We built you a ramp.

33:58.094 --> 34:00.426
Did he have access
to the vaults?

34:00.496 --> 34:03.294
Well, yes. He has a key to the day gate.
Several of us do.

34:03.366 --> 34:06.824
- What are you looking for, Mulder?
- Any hint at all...

34:06.903 --> 34:11.397
as to why Maleeni here
is really impersonating his brother.

34:11.474 --> 34:13.873
What about this? Could he have
removed the funds electronically?

34:13.943 --> 34:18.641
He didn't have security clearance
for E.F.T. S... electronic fund transfers.

34:18.715 --> 34:22.047
Maybe he got around the security.
Can we check the withdrawal records?

34:22.118 --> 34:24.780
It would require your badge number
and thumbprint...

34:24.853 --> 34:26.822
and probably
a federal subpoena to boot.

34:26.889 --> 34:29.449
We're extra cautious with the E.F. T.s.
You can understand why.

34:29.525 --> 34:32.494
There may be an easier way.

34:32.562 --> 34:35.121
- If I call up a transaction list
for this terminal...
- [Keyboard Clacking]

34:37.634 --> 34:40.659
No. No, everything's in order.

34:44.873 --> 34:48.331
Mulder, it says here something
about a robbery attempt yesterday.

34:48.411 --> 34:52.609
Yeah, that wasn't against us, but the
armored transport service we deal with.

34:52.681 --> 34:55.650
No money was taken
and no suspects were caught.

34:55.717 --> 35:00.052
Yeah, well, Mr. Pinchbeck was
the employee who signed out the truck.

35:00.123 --> 35:03.024
- He knew the schedule.
- I had nothing to do with that.

35:03.092 --> 35:05.788
Maybe, maybe not.

35:05.862 --> 35:07.955
We'll hold you
till we find out.

35:08.031 --> 35:10.522
Make sure you don't
pull a vanishing act.

35:15.872 --> 35:18.136
- [Door Opens, Closes]
- Hey.

35:19.409 --> 35:21.343
[Buzzing]

35:27.450 --> 35:29.611
Paul, I'm putting
Mr. Pinchbeck in six.

35:29.686 --> 35:31.620
[Paul]
Right.

35:33.122 --> 35:35.056
[Offcer]
Sleep tight.

35:35.124 --> 35:37.456
Wait. Don't I get
a phone call, sir?

35:37.527 --> 35:39.461
- Sir?
- [Door Shuts]

35:41.464 --> 35:43.728
[Tapping "Shave And A Haircut"]

35:51.774 --> 35:54.675
- How'd it go?
- Swimmingly.

35:56.079 --> 35:58.013
Abracadabra, man.

36:11.561 --> 36:13.188
[Grunts]

36:20.803 --> 36:22.737
Oh, damn!

36:27.677 --> 36:29.907
Yes. Okay.

36:29.979 --> 36:33.244
- All right. All right, thank you.
- Maleeni?

36:33.316 --> 36:37.377
He's still in the city lockup,
where he's been since
we arrested him last night.

36:37.453 --> 36:40.547
Certainly doesn't
look like he did this.

36:40.623 --> 36:42.557
Lots of fingerprints.

36:42.625 --> 36:45.287
Yeah, I guarantee you,
none of them match our thieves.

36:45.361 --> 36:47.829
They're too clever
to leave clues,

36:47.897 --> 36:49.956
except for the ones
they want us to find.

36:50.033 --> 36:53.400
- Excuse me. May I show you something?
- Hmm.

36:53.469 --> 36:56.529
[Manager]
We thought the security-camera footage
might show the robbers.

36:56.606 --> 36:59.268
- [Scully] Does it?
- No. They all mysteriously...

36:59.342 --> 37:01.936
went blank from about
3:00 a.m. To 3:20,

37:02.011 --> 37:05.947
- but that's not what
we wanted you to see.
- This is from two days ago.

37:09.583 --> 37:13.110
Cissy Alvarez,
convicted bank robber.

37:13.187 --> 37:16.645
- You recognize this man?
- Yeah. Who is he to you?

37:16.724 --> 37:20.717
- [Tapping Keyboard]
- [Anthony] I know those tattoos.

37:20.795 --> 37:22.786
That's the man who
tried to rob my truck.

37:22.863 --> 37:25.991
Aah! What the hell, man?
What did I do?

37:26.067 --> 37:29.264
Yo, F.B.I., what's up?
What's up with this, man?

37:29.337 --> 37:31.805
You can't just come bustin'in here!
I got civil rights!

37:31.872 --> 37:34.602
I'm gonna call my lawyer,
and then we're gonna see what's what.

37:34.675 --> 37:38.441
- There's nothing back there.
- This is harassment, man.
This is harassment!

37:38.512 --> 37:40.639
Yo, what are they
lookin' for?

37:40.715 --> 37:42.842
- Come on! Somebody talk to me!
- [Offcer] Shut up!

37:42.917 --> 37:45.647
[Alvarez] No, you shut up!
Yo, man, this ain't right.

37:45.720 --> 37:47.847
Why you got the cuffs
on so tight?

37:47.922 --> 37:51.414
Yo, will you please tell me
what he's lookin'for?

37:55.863 --> 37:58.661
Oh!

37:58.733 --> 38:03.830
- What?
- Well. Saving up for a rainy day?

38:06.407 --> 38:09.604
- Oh, no, no, no! We got framed!
This is a frame-up!
- [Offcer] Let's go.

38:09.677 --> 38:12.942
- It was the magician!
- The magician? Maleeni?

38:13.014 --> 38:17.713
No, not the dead one, man! That little
cabron LaBonge! LaBonge set me up!

38:17.785 --> 38:20.549
- Listen to me! Listen to me!
- Billy LaBonge.

38:20.621 --> 38:25.115
And the Amazing Maleeni. That's a
double bill I wouldn't want to miss.

38:27.595 --> 38:29.995
Pinchbeck.
You made your bail.

38:35.636 --> 38:37.570
You, too, LaBonge.

38:41.409 --> 38:43.877
- [Officer] Okay.
- [Buzzing]

38:43.944 --> 38:47.971
- I think releasing these two
may be a bit premature.
- [Mulder] Give us a minute.

38:52.153 --> 38:54.383
Good morning, gentlemen.
Did you sleep well?

38:54.455 --> 38:57.151
Agent Mulder.
Agent Scully.

38:57.224 --> 39:02.025
- Bravo. Really.
- What do you mean?

39:02.096 --> 39:06.499
Last night the Cradock Marine Bank
was robbed of $1.8 million.

39:06.567 --> 39:08.694
This morning that
entire amount was found...

39:08.769 --> 39:11.033
in the possession
of Mr. Cissy Alvarez.

39:11.105 --> 39:14.939
Wow. I told you he was bad news.
Bravo to you.

39:15.009 --> 39:17.534
- It was expeditious police work.
- [Chuckles] Well, thank you.

39:17.611 --> 39:21.672
It was, wasn't it? It's only that
Alvarez was so obviously guilty...

39:21.749 --> 39:23.842
a convicted bank robber
caught red-handed,

39:23.918 --> 39:26.580
witnessed trying to rob an armored car
just two days earlier?

39:26.654 --> 39:28.918
- He'll need a good lawyer.
- Yeah.

39:28.989 --> 39:31.719
- Yeah, he's up a creek,
just like you two want him.
- Yeah.

39:31.792 --> 39:34.556
I don't quite see where
you're headed with this.

39:34.628 --> 39:38.223
I have no evidence,
but I have a theory, Mr. Maleeni,

39:38.299 --> 39:41.393
and, uh, I'll tell you
how it goes.

39:41.469 --> 39:44.336
I think that your twin brother Albert
died of a heart attack,

39:44.405 --> 39:47.431
at which point, you and your
young protegee saw a golden opportunity.

39:47.508 --> 39:50.272
My protegee?
I hate this guy's guts.

39:50.344 --> 39:53.336
That's what you
wanted us to think.

39:53.414 --> 39:57.248
[Mulder]
You wanted revenge against the man who
made your life in prison a living hell.

39:57.318 --> 40:00.481
I did time with you
about eight years ago.

40:00.554 --> 40:05.321
Alvarez. You and he were on
the same cell block eight years ago.

40:05.392 --> 40:09.226
It was a setup from the start.
You played poker with him,
and you made sure that you lost big.

40:09.296 --> 40:13.232
Which gave LaBonge an in with Alvarez
once everybody thought you were dead.

40:13.300 --> 40:17.100
[Scully]
LaBonge planted Alvarez's marker in
Maleeni's van and made sure we found it.

40:17.171 --> 40:19.662
And then you used Alvarez's greed
in order to ensnare him,

40:19.740 --> 40:24.404
and then orchestrated the attempted
bank robbery in order to implicate him.

40:24.478 --> 40:27.174
Yeah, that was you in the armored car
disguised as Alvarez.

40:27.248 --> 40:30.979
Somehow Mr. Pinchbeck got ahold of
the guard's gun and switched the clip.

40:31.051 --> 40:33.576
- Hold it!
- Guard didn't know it,
but he was fring blanks.

40:33.654 --> 40:36.646
And then last night,
the two of you robbed the bank...

40:36.724 --> 40:39.284
and planted the money
at Alvarez's place.

40:42.062 --> 40:44.326
Don't you think we have
pretty good alibis?

40:44.398 --> 40:47.265
You have great alibis.
You have the best alibis in the world,

40:47.334 --> 40:50.303
which is why I think you two
got arrested in the first place.

40:50.371 --> 40:54.000
[Scully]
With your expertise in sleight of hand,
pickpocketing and escapology,

40:54.074 --> 40:58.340
I think you were both able to get out
of here by pilfering a guard's key.

40:58.412 --> 41:00.710
You could have escaped,
stolen the money, framed Alvarez...

41:00.781 --> 41:02.806
and been back here
in time for breakfast.

41:02.883 --> 41:05.181
Scrambled eggs and sausage.

41:05.252 --> 41:08.312
That would be the world's
greatest trick, wouldn't it?

41:08.389 --> 41:12.018
One that would be forever remembered
in the annals of magic.

41:15.095 --> 41:18.895
- What happens to us?
- [Mulder] To you?

41:18.966 --> 41:23.164
You go free,
provided the magic is over.

41:25.172 --> 41:28.141
The great ones always know
when to leave the stage.

41:29.944 --> 41:32.412
[Buzzing]

41:32.479 --> 41:35.107
Billy, let's get
the hell outta here.

41:43.157 --> 41:47.651
- They are the world's greatest.
- We saw through their magic.

41:47.728 --> 41:49.662
Ah, there's more.

41:53.767 --> 41:56.235
Behold.

41:56.303 --> 41:59.329
- The Amazing Maleeni's wallet.
- You picked his pocket?

41:59.406 --> 42:02.273
No, I pilfered it from the evidence room
to prevent them from completing...

42:02.343 --> 42:04.607
their final act
of prestidigitation.

42:04.678 --> 42:06.737
- What are you talking about?
- I began to wonder,

42:06.814 --> 42:08.907
why did they need
so elaborate a setup?

42:08.983 --> 42:12.612
Why so high profile?
Why draw the attention
of the F.B.I. In the first place?

42:12.686 --> 42:15.211
We were the last piece
of the puzzle.

42:15.289 --> 42:17.553
Yes. Framing Alvarez was
just another misdirection.

42:17.625 --> 42:21.493
This trick was about E.F.T. S,
electronic fund transfers at the bank.

42:21.562 --> 42:24.861
Maleeni, Pinchbeck, he didn't have
security clearance for them,

42:24.932 --> 42:28.095
so he needed a little federal law
enforcement intervention...

42:28.168 --> 42:30.363
specifcally,
my badge number...

42:31.939 --> 42:34.908
and my thumbprint.

42:34.975 --> 42:38.934
With those two items
they could pull off an E.F.T.
And steal enough electronically...

42:39.013 --> 42:42.039
as to make that 1.8 million
look like cigar-lighting money.

42:44.151 --> 42:46.585
But they can't do it
without this.

42:48.289 --> 42:51.986
Pick a card, Scully.
Any card.

42:56.096 --> 42:59.224
You know, Mulder, there's still
one thing that you haven't explained.

42:59.300 --> 43:01.234
What's that?

43:01.302 --> 43:04.635
How the Amazing Maleeni was able
to turn his head completely around.

43:04.705 --> 43:07.071
- I don't know that.
- I do.

43:07.141 --> 43:09.666
I'll show you.
Observe.

43:26.694 --> 43:29.788
Gee! Very nice.
How'd you do that?

43:31.832 --> 43:34.926
Well... magic.

43:35.002 --> 43:37.368
No, seriously, Scully.
How'd you do it?

43:38.906 --> 43:41.272
You know,
it's not the same thing.

43:41.342 --> 43:46.405
Uh, it's different with the head.
Come on, now. Look at this.

43:46.480 --> 43:48.414
[Chuckling]

44:27.552 --> 44:30.455
[Child]
I made this!
