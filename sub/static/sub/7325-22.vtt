WEBVTT

00:03.634 --> 00:05.005
WHAT HAVE WE GOT?

00:05.005 --> 00:06.277
KAYLA WAYNE, 32,
HYPOTENSIVE AND TACHYCARDIC.

00:06.277 --> 00:08.008
HYPOXIC
EVEN AFTER INTUBATION.

00:08.008 --> 00:09.480
SEVERE OPEN WOUND
TO THE MID AND LOWER ABDOMEN.

00:09.480 --> 00:11.082
WE'RE WITH HER.
SHE'S PART OF OUR ACT.

00:11.082 --> 00:12.213
I SAID "TITANIC"!
I SAID IT!

00:12.213 --> 00:13.714
WELL,
I DIDN'T HEAR YOU!

00:13.714 --> 00:16.247
(Meredith) THERE'S
NO SUCH THING AS MAGIC...

00:16.247 --> 00:17.388
AS FAR AS WE KNOW.

00:17.388 --> 00:19.090
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD.

00:19.090 --> 00:21.252
OKAY, SLOW DOWN
AND TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

00:21.252 --> 00:22.753
SHE'S MY WIFE
AND--AND--AND ASSISTANT.

00:22.753 --> 00:24.295
PLEASE DON'T LET HER DIE.
(sobs)

00:24.295 --> 00:26.457
WE WERE--WE WERE, UH, PERFORMING
AT A--AT A TRADE SHOW.

00:26.457 --> 00:28.199
YEAH, WE WEREN'T READY.

00:28.199 --> 00:31.162
AND WHILE, AS SURGEONS,
WE STUDY THE SECRETS BEHIND

00:31.162 --> 00:33.564
THE HUMAN BODY'S INTRICATE
NETWORK OF CELLS,

00:33.564 --> 00:35.466
TISSUES, AND ORGANS,

00:35.466 --> 00:37.608
WHEN THINGS GO WRONG...

00:37.608 --> 00:38.769
PERFORMING WHAT?

00:38.769 --> 00:40.241
IT WAS SAW THE LADY
IN HALF.

00:40.241 --> 00:41.272
NO WAY.

00:41.272 --> 00:44.115
HORRIBLY, HORRIBLY WRONG...

00:44.115 --> 00:45.176
(Shane gasps)

00:45.176 --> 00:48.149
AND HE REALLY DID
WITH A CHAIN SAW!

00:48.149 --> 00:52.283
THERE ARE ONLY SO MANY TRICKS
WE HAVE UP OUR SLEEVES

00:52.283 --> 00:53.654
TO PUT A BODY BACK TOGETHER.

00:53.654 --> 00:54.785
PAGE BAILEY!

00:54.785 --> 00:56.727
(thuds)

00:56.727 --> 00:59.190
BUT THERE IS A KIND OF POWER...

00:59.190 --> 01:01.132
MORE OF A SPELL, REALLY.

01:01.132 --> 01:02.633
I'M LAUREN.
(elevator bell dings)

01:02.633 --> 01:04.235
AND WHEN WE GET IT RIGHT...

01:04.235 --> 01:06.097
UM, OKAY. HI, LAUREN.

01:06.097 --> 01:07.298
IT CAN BE
PRETTY DAMN MAGICAL.

01:07.298 --> 01:09.470
NO, I'M THE LAUREN
AS IN "LAUREN" ON THE COFFEE

01:09.470 --> 01:11.472
YOU'RE WAY OVER-SUGARING.

01:11.472 --> 01:14.175
OH, G--AY! YIKES.
I AM--I AM SO SORRY.

01:14.175 --> 01:15.506
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DIDN'T EVEN LOOK UP THERE.

01:15.506 --> 01:17.148
IT'S OKAY.
I JUST GRABBED IT,
SO... (laughs)

01:17.148 --> 01:18.449
REALLY,
IT'S NOT A BIG PROBLEM.

01:18.449 --> 01:20.551

01:20.551 --> 01:22.183
YEAH, THAT'S ME.

01:22.183 --> 01:23.384

01:23.384 --> 01:25.085
WELL, NOW IT'S ME.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.517

01:26.517 --> 01:28.259
SEE YOU AROUND, I HOPE.

01:28.259 --> 01:32.223
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

01:32.223 --> 01:33.624
GREY, UH, WHOA.

01:33.624 --> 01:34.795
WOW.

01:34.795 --> 01:36.167
YEAH.

01:36.167 --> 01:37.298
IT LOOKS LIKE
THE PELVIS IS INVOLVED.

01:37.298 --> 01:38.569
WE'LL GET MORE X-RAYS
IN THE O.R.

01:38.569 --> 01:40.231
YEAH, NO, NO. CLEARLY,
YOU HAVE BIGGER FISH TO FRY.

01:40.231 --> 01:42.133
I COULDN'T HEAR "TITANIC."
THE SONG?

01:42.133 --> 01:43.304
NO, IT'S OUR SAFE WORD.

01:43.304 --> 01:44.535
AND I YELLED IT, LIKE,
A HUNDRED TIMES

01:44.535 --> 01:45.806
WHEN THE SPRING FLAP
WOULDN'T OPEN.

01:45.806 --> 01:47.408
SHUT UP, CHERISE.
YOU DON'T REVEAL THE SECRETS--

01:47.408 --> 01:48.539
(Callie) SOMEONE
GET THEM OUTTA HERE.

01:48.539 --> 01:49.710
YOU KNOW, BROOKS IS ON
MY MOYAMOYA CASE,

01:49.710 --> 01:50.881
BUT IF YOU NEED HER HERE--

01:50.881 --> 01:52.213
WELL, I HAVE ROSS,
AND--AND I PAGED BAILEY,

01:52.213 --> 01:53.384
SO YOU CAN TAKE HER.

01:53.384 --> 01:55.216
WHAT?
BUT SHE'S CUT IN HALF.

01:55.216 --> 01:56.387
THIS IS GONNA BE AMAZING.

01:56.387 --> 01:58.449
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS AMAZING?
A MOYAMOYA.

01:58.449 --> 01:59.620
I GOT PAGED.
(elevator bell dings)

01:59.620 --> 02:00.851
CHAIN SAW
TO THE ABDOMEN.

02:00.851 --> 02:02.223
YEAH?

02:02.223 --> 02:03.224
I PAGED BAILEY.

02:03.224 --> 02:04.355
YEAH,
I HAVE BAILEY'S PATIENTS.

02:04.355 --> 02:06.227
WHAT? STILL?

02:06.227 --> 02:08.559
BUT SHE'S INFECTION-FREE.
UH, CLEAR TO OPERATE.
(bell dings)

02:08.559 --> 02:10.301
OKAY, WELL, PAGE ME WHEN SHE'S
STABLE ENOUGH FOR X-RAYS.

02:10.301 --> 02:12.233
HOW IS SHE STILL ALIVE?

02:12.233 --> 02:13.204
I HAVE NO IDEA.

02:13.204 --> 02:15.166
(bell dings)

02:15.166 --> 02:17.168
(people speaking indistinctly)

02:17.168 --> 02:18.639
(Owen sighs)

02:18.639 --> 02:20.311
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

02:20.311 --> 02:22.473
HE SPENT THE ENTIRE NIGHT?
YEAH.

02:22.473 --> 02:24.144
HE HEARD YOU SAY EIGHT DAYS.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.177
HE WANTS TO BE HERE
WHEN HIS DAD WAKES UP.

02:26.177 --> 02:29.149
YOU UNDERSTAND
THAT MIGHT NOT HAPPEN.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.921
WELL, OF COURSE I DO.

02:30.921 --> 02:32.253
BUT ETHAN'S
JUST A LITTLE BOY.

02:32.253 --> 02:34.285
NANCY, NANCY,
YOU NEED TO TALK TO HIM.

02:34.285 --> 02:35.586
PREPARE HIM
FOR THE POSSIBILITY--

02:35.586 --> 02:38.259
I CAN'T--
I-I CAN'T BE THE ONE

02:38.259 --> 02:40.461
TO--TO ADD TO HIS BURDEN.
I...

02:40.461 --> 02:42.293
(voice breaks)
YOU--YOU TALK TO HIM, PLEASE.

02:42.293 --> 02:45.566
DID I MISS IT?
IS HE AWAKE?

02:50.701 --> 02:52.273
(elevator bell dings)

02:53.574 --> 02:54.905
(exhales)
JUST BECAUSE A FAMILY...

02:54.905 --> 02:56.377
(clicks button)
OVERHEARS YOU SAY EIGHT DAYS,

02:56.377 --> 02:58.209
IT'S NOT LIKE,
MAGICALLY ON DAY EIGHT,

02:58.209 --> 02:59.710
THE GUY'S GONNA WAKE UP.

02:59.710 --> 03:02.453
I MEAN, IT COULD BE DAY FOUR
OR DAY TEN.

03:04.184 --> 03:08.289
(heavy metal song
playing loudly)

03:08.289 --> 03:09.790
OH, WHAT IS THAT?

03:09.790 --> 03:11.662
(mocking voice) THE SOUNDTRACK
OF YOUR BROKEN HEART?

03:11.662 --> 03:13.464
YOU GOTTA GET OVER
THAT HAIRBALL.

03:13.464 --> 03:15.496
I'M TRYING,
BUT I KEEP RUNNING INTO HER.

03:15.496 --> 03:17.598
(ding, doors open)

03:18.969 --> 03:20.331
OUT OF ORDER, HAIRBALL.
(clicks button)

03:20.331 --> 03:22.303
TAKE THE STAIRS.

03:24.335 --> 03:25.676
HI, KIM. I'M DR. KEPNER.

03:25.676 --> 03:26.977
I HEAR YOU'RE HAVING
SOME STOMACH PAIN.

03:26.977 --> 03:28.509
(groans
and speaks indistinctly)

03:28.509 --> 03:29.840
SHE WAS OVER-SERVED.

03:29.840 --> 03:31.211
(slurring) OR ROOFIED.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.413
THE BARTENDER
WAS A TOTAL SKEEVE.

03:32.413 --> 03:34.385
HE TRIED TO GRAB MY ASS.

03:34.385 --> 03:36.247
(laughs)
NO, HE CAUGHT YOUR ASS.

03:36.247 --> 03:37.548
YOU THREW IT AT HIM.
(laughs)

03:37.548 --> 03:39.350
(laughs) BAM!

03:39.350 --> 03:40.521
AAH!

03:40.521 --> 03:41.852
OW!

03:41.852 --> 03:43.223
OW.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.355
IS SHE GONNA BOOT?

03:44.355 --> 03:45.696
SHE SHOULD. GOOD CALL.
MM.

03:45.696 --> 03:48.699
YOU ONLY TURN 21 ONCE, KIMMY.
BOOT AND RALLY.

03:48.699 --> 03:49.860
(Kim groans)

03:49.860 --> 03:51.662
UH, CAN YOU GUYS
FOCUS FOR A SECOND?

03:51.662 --> 03:54.965
CAN YOU--CAN, UH, CAN YOU
REMEMBER WHEN THE PAIN STARTED?

03:54.965 --> 03:56.367
AT KAPPA SIG.

03:56.367 --> 03:58.669
NO, SHE WAS MAKING OUT
WITH ERIC AT KAPPA SIG.

03:58.669 --> 04:00.711
I THINK IT WAS AT BRUNCH.
(moans)

04:00.711 --> 04:02.242
OH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.544
IT'S PROBABLY JUST
FOOD POISONING OR SOMETHING.

04:03.544 --> 04:05.316
CAN'T YOU
JUST PUMP HER STOMACH?

04:05.316 --> 04:06.917
NO. CAN YOU...

04:06.917 --> 04:08.419
(Kim moans)
SMILE, BEEYOTCH.

04:08.419 --> 04:10.321
UH, I NEED TO RUN
SOME TESTS.
(shutter clicks)

04:10.321 --> 04:11.382
YOU'LL WAIT FOR HER?

04:11.382 --> 04:12.853
(sighs) HOW LONG?

04:12.853 --> 04:16.427
'CAUSE MY ECON STUDY GROUP
STARTS IN, LIKE, AN HOUR.

04:16.427 --> 04:17.988
(vomits)

04:17.988 --> 04:21.962
(sputters and laughs)

04:23.564 --> 04:25.265

04:25.265 --> 04:26.567
(Callie)
WHO'S LAUREN?

04:26.567 --> 04:28.268
(elevator bell dings)
HUH?

04:28.268 --> 04:29.940
OH, GOD. IT'S ACTUALLY
A FUNNY STORY. I WAS--

04:29.940 --> 04:31.271
DID YOU KNOW THAT WEBBER
IS STILL TAKING

04:31.271 --> 04:32.643
ALL OF BAILEY'S PATIENTS?

04:32.643 --> 04:33.974
OH, YEAH. SHE'S PROBABLY
HOLED UP IN THE GENOME LAB

04:33.974 --> 04:35.306
BECAUSE OF THAT C.D.C. THING.

04:35.306 --> 04:36.677
WELL, WE'RE NOT THE ONES
WHO CALLED THEM.

04:36.677 --> 04:39.009
IF SHE'S GONNA BE PISSED
AT ANYONE, IT SHOULD BE HIM.

04:39.009 --> 04:40.411
WHO'S PISSED AT ME NOW?

04:40.411 --> 04:41.582
WELL, YOU CALLED THE C.D.C.,

04:41.582 --> 04:42.753
AND NOW BAILEY HATES
ALL OF US.

04:42.753 --> 04:43.914
WE ALL CALLED
THE C.D.C.

04:43.914 --> 04:45.285
I DIDN'T.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.056
WE SHOULD,
UH, GO TALK TO HER.

04:46.056 --> 04:47.588
OH, NO.
I HAVE A CONSULT.

04:47.588 --> 04:49.990
HOW CAN YOU GO WORK WHEN
YOU KNOW BAILEY IS MAD AT YOU?

04:49.990 --> 04:51.592
(indistinct conversations
continue)

04:51.592 --> 04:52.863
HEY.

04:52.863 --> 04:54.865
OH, GOD. I TOTALLY FORGOT
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

04:54.865 --> 04:56.427
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE
DINNER AND SEX.

04:56.427 --> 04:57.598
(elevator bell dings)
DINNER. OR JUST THE DINNER.

04:57.598 --> 04:58.769
UH, MAYBE THE SEX
WAS ALL IN MY HEAD.

04:58.769 --> 05:00.030
OR IT COULD'VE BEEN
IN YOUR MIND, TOO,

05:00.030 --> 05:01.572
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER
BECAUSE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

05:01.572 --> 05:03.073
I FORGOT.
BUT I REMEMBER RIGHT NOW.

05:03.073 --> 05:04.775
AND I FEEL TERRIBLE.
OKAY.

05:04.775 --> 05:06.306
I'M GONNA MAKE IT UP TO YOU
TONIGHT.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.008

(Richard) GOOD GOD.

07:36.857 --> 07:38.759
THERE ARE EVEN CHAIN SAW CUTS
ON HER VERTEBRAE.

07:38.759 --> 07:40.631
ROSS, GET YOUR HANDS
IN THERE IF YOU HAVE TO

07:40.631 --> 07:42.462
AND SCOOP OUT THE CLOTS.

07:42.462 --> 07:45.465
pH IS 6.9
AND TEMP IS 96.7.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.598
IT'S TOO MUCH.
WE HAVE TO PACK HER.

07:49.169 --> 07:51.471
I, UH, I JUST TOOK A LOOK
AT THE FILMS YOU DID.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.143
I'LL NEED TO PLATE THE FRACTURE
AS SOON AS SHE'S STABLE.

07:53.143 --> 07:56.146
OH. IF SHE'S EVER STABLE.

07:56.146 --> 07:57.548
OKAY,
WE'RE DOING DAMAGE CONTROL.

07:57.548 --> 07:59.610
GOT IT. UM, OH, I WENT
TO SEE BAILEY,

07:59.610 --> 08:00.951
AND SHE DIDN'T SAY A WORD.

08:00.951 --> 08:02.212
DR. WEBBER,
HAS SHE SPOKEN TO YOU?

08:02.212 --> 08:03.954
RIGHT NOW MY ATTENTION
IS ON THIS PATIENT,

08:03.954 --> 08:06.186
WHO'S HEADED FOR
A METABOLIC COLLAPSE.

08:06.186 --> 08:08.158
OKAY. JUST LET ME KNOW
WHEN YOU NEED ME.

08:08.158 --> 08:09.520
ROSS, FASTER.

08:09.520 --> 08:11.261
THE SOONER WE GET HER
TO I.C.U.,

08:11.261 --> 08:12.993
THE BETTER A CHANCE
SHE'LL HAVE.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.526
(Derek) MM. THAT'S OKAY, IRIS.

08:15.526 --> 08:17.528
YEAH, HER ARM IS STILL WEAK
FROM THE T.I.A.s.

08:17.528 --> 08:19.099
BUT WE--WE'LL TAKE CARE
OF THAT.

08:19.099 --> 08:20.500
BROOKS, PLEASE.

08:20.500 --> 08:24.174
IRIS KANE, 7 YEARS OLD,
HERE FOR AN OMENTAL FLAP

08:24.174 --> 08:25.936
THAT WILL TREAT
HER MOYAMOYA DISEASE.

08:25.936 --> 08:27.277
(boy) MOYAMOYA.

08:27.277 --> 08:29.109
BORING!
HEY, DAVID.

08:29.109 --> 08:30.280
HOSPITAL BEHAVIOR,
OKAY?

08:30.280 --> 08:31.682
LET ME GO!

08:31.682 --> 08:32.983
NO, NO, NO, HONEY.
MOMMY AND DADDY NEED TO HEAR

08:32.983 --> 08:34.244
HOW THE DOCTORS
ARE GOING TO FIX IRIS.

08:34.244 --> 08:36.617
BUDDY, HERE.
LOOK WHAT I BROUGHT FROM HOME.

08:36.617 --> 08:37.848
(imitating fight sounds)

08:37.848 --> 08:39.119
I'M SORRY.
HE JUST FEELS LEFT OUT.

08:39.119 --> 08:40.851
MM-HMM.
I-I'M SORRY. GO ON.

08:40.851 --> 08:42.222
(continues imitating
fight sounds)
KAREV.

08:42.222 --> 08:43.854
UH, SOME OF THE BLOOD VESSELS
IN IRIS' BRAIN...

08:43.854 --> 08:45.696
(computer beeps)
HAVE NARROWED
AND BEEN CHOKED OFF.

08:45.696 --> 08:47.197
SO I'LL TAKE TISSUE
WITH HEALTHY VESSELS

08:47.197 --> 08:48.829
FROM IRIS' ABDOMEN.
(David continues imitating
fight sounds)

08:48.829 --> 08:51.101
AND I WILL TAKE THAT TISSUE,
PLACE IT IN HER BRAIN...

08:51.101 --> 08:52.262
(beeps)
WHERE IT'LL ABSORB THE VESSELS

08:52.262 --> 08:53.664
AND GET THE BLOOD SUPPLY...
(trills lips)

08:53.664 --> 08:55.105
IT NEEDS.

08:55.105 --> 08:56.737
AND THIS WILL HELP
WITH HER ARM STRENGTH.

08:56.737 --> 08:58.168
(continues imitating
fight sounds)
DAVID, BUDDY, COME HERE.

08:58.168 --> 09:00.240
JUST SIT STILL, OKAY?
UM, HEY.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.172
UM, DAVID, I'LL PLAY
ARMY MEN WITH YOU...
OHH!

09:02.172 --> 09:03.714
(gasps)
DAVID!

09:03.714 --> 09:05.215
(David) I WANT TO GO!
I WANT TO GO! I WANT TO GO!

09:05.215 --> 09:07.177
(man) WHAT DID WE TALK ABOUT?
(woman) I'M SO SORRY.

09:07.177 --> 09:08.779
HANDS ARE FOR HUGGING!
UH, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

09:08.779 --> 09:10.150
DAVID!
I WANT TO GO! I WANT TO GO!

09:10.150 --> 09:11.151
GO AHEAD.

09:11.151 --> 09:12.853
YOU COULD JUST TELL ME.

09:12.853 --> 09:14.254
THEY'RE GONNA BE A WHILE.

09:14.254 --> 09:17.087
(car horn honks)

09:17.087 --> 09:20.060
(coos)

09:20.060 --> 09:22.232
DR. ROBBINS,
WE WERE JUST GETTING STARTED.

09:22.232 --> 09:23.333
OHH.

09:23.333 --> 09:24.695
(elevator bell dings)
ARIZONA.

09:24.695 --> 09:25.936
OH, YOU GUYS
KNOW EACH OTHER?

09:25.936 --> 09:27.137
(chuckles) YEAH.
NO.

09:27.137 --> 09:29.670
I--WE MET--
WE MET BRIEFLY.

09:29.670 --> 09:31.171
WE HAD COFFEE.

09:31.171 --> 09:33.203
DR. BOSWELL IS
THE CRANIOFACIAL SPECIALIST

09:33.203 --> 09:35.205
WE FLEW IN TO HELP
WITH TYLER'S CASE.

09:35.205 --> 09:37.077
Y-YOU'RE DR. BOSWELL?

09:37.077 --> 09:39.579
MM-HMM. YEAH,
HOW ABOUT THIS LITTLE GUY?

09:39.579 --> 09:42.152
BRAIN ON THE OUTSIDE.
THAT CAN'T BE COMFORTABLE, HUH?

09:42.152 --> 09:44.584
WELL, UH, WELCOME.
WE'RE GLAD TO HAVE YOU.

09:44.584 --> 09:45.756
OH, ARE YOU KIDDING?

09:45.756 --> 09:47.217
I MEAN, THE COMBINATION
OF ENCEPHALOCELE

09:47.217 --> 09:48.859
AND FACIAL CLEFT--

09:48.859 --> 09:51.121
SURGEONS GO THEIR WHOLE CAREER
WITHOUT SEEING ONE OF THESE.

09:51.121 --> 09:52.623
SO I'M THRILLED TO BE HERE.

09:52.623 --> 09:54.194
UM, WHAT'S YOUR APPROACH?

09:54.194 --> 09:56.266
UM, I'D LIKE TO GET
A COUPLE MORE SCANS

09:56.266 --> 09:58.098
BEFORE I COMMIT TO ANYTHING.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.269
OKAY, GO AHEAD.

09:59.269 --> 10:00.300
YEAH.

10:00.300 --> 10:01.972
WE, UH, WE CAN TALK
STRATEGY LATER.

10:01.972 --> 10:03.233
I'LL LOOK FORWARD
TO THAT.

10:03.233 --> 10:04.935
(telephone rings)

10:04.935 --> 10:07.137
(baby cries)

10:07.137 --> 10:08.839
CAN'T BELIEVE
WE GOT HER, HUH?

10:08.839 --> 10:10.140
SHE'S A ROCK STAR.

10:10.140 --> 10:11.111
(car horn honks)

10:11.111 --> 10:14.614
YEAH, SHE SEEMS, UM...
COMPETENT.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.186
(cards flip)

10:16.186 --> 10:18.118
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

10:18.118 --> 10:19.289
(Richard) SHE'S TOO UNSTABLE.

10:19.289 --> 10:20.290
WE WANT TO LET HER BODY REST

10:20.290 --> 10:21.792
BEFORE WE TAKE HER
BACK TO SURGERY.

10:21.792 --> 10:22.953
BUT WE'RE NOT
GONNA LOSE HER?

10:22.953 --> 10:24.124
I-I CAN'T LOSE HER.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.295
YOU SHOULDA THOUGHT OF THAT
BEFORE YOU ADDED

10:25.295 --> 10:27.798
A CHAIN SAW TO THE TRICK.
ILLUSION!

10:27.798 --> 10:30.330
AND I ONLY ADDED THE CHAIN SAW
TO TRY TO GET US BETTER GIGS.

10:30.330 --> 10:32.703
YOUR CHAIN SAW DROWNED US OUT
WHEN THE TRAP DOOR GOT STUCK.

10:32.703 --> 10:34.364
BA-BA-BA-BA-BA.
MAGICIAN'S CODE.

10:34.364 --> 10:36.066
(Cherise)
OH, MY GOD. REALLY?

10:36.066 --> 10:38.939
OKAY, WELL, WE'LL LET YOU KNOW
WHEN SHE'S READY

10:38.939 --> 10:41.311
TO GO BACK INTO SURGERY.

10:45.275 --> 10:49.279
SO LET'S SAY I PURSUED
A DIFFERENT COURSE OF THERAPY.

10:49.279 --> 10:51.051
OKAY. YOU--
DON'T SPEAK.

10:53.123 --> 10:55.956
PATIENT SUFFERED
AORTIC TRANSECTION,

10:55.956 --> 10:58.328
MIRACULOUSLY REPAIRED
BY ME,

10:58.328 --> 11:00.330
AND THEN HAD A POST-OP
INFERIOR M.I.

11:00.330 --> 11:02.032
THAT LED TO CARDIAC ARREST.

11:02.032 --> 11:03.834
SO I INDUCED HYPOTHERMIA.

11:03.834 --> 11:05.836
(drops pen)
LET'S SAY, HYPOTHETICALLY,
THAT I DID NOT.

11:05.836 --> 11:07.938
WHAT ELSE COULD I HAVE DONE?

11:07.938 --> 11:10.200
DON'T ANSWER THAT.
(car horn honks in distance)

11:10.200 --> 11:12.342
I COULD'VE TAKEN HIM
STRAIGHT TO THE CATH LAB.

11:12.342 --> 11:14.344
BUT, NO, I COULD NOT HAVE
BECAUSE HAD HE HAD HEPARIN

11:14.344 --> 11:16.246
AFTER HIS SURGERY,

11:16.246 --> 11:18.108
THAT WOULD'VE CAUSED
HIS AORTA TO BLOW.

11:18.108 --> 11:19.950
AND THEN I'D HAVE TO TELL
THE KID THAT DADDY'S A GONER

11:19.950 --> 11:21.111
'CAUSE I BLEW IT?

11:21.111 --> 11:23.213
NO. SO I WAS RIGHT.
RIGHT?

11:23.213 --> 11:25.085
RIGHT.
OH, I'M NOT ASKING YOU.

11:26.787 --> 11:30.120
GIRLS, I REALLY, REALLY
NEED YOUR HELP HERE, OKAY?

11:30.120 --> 11:32.292
I NEED TO KNOW EVERYTHING
THAT SHE INGESTED LAST NIGHT--

11:32.292 --> 11:34.064
EVERY SINGLE THING
THAT WENT INTO HER MOUTH.

11:34.064 --> 11:35.325
(snickers) EVERYTHING?

11:35.325 --> 11:36.967
(both laugh)

11:36.967 --> 11:39.369
KIM'S STUDIES SHOW THAT SHE HAS
A RUPTURE IN HER ABDOMEN,

11:39.369 --> 11:40.831
WHICH IS BAD.

11:40.831 --> 11:42.132
IT IS VERY, VERY BAD.

11:42.132 --> 11:43.403
HELLO? OH, OKAY.

11:43.403 --> 11:45.405
WHO IS THAT?

11:45.405 --> 11:47.437
HOLY PANTY DROPPER.

11:47.437 --> 11:50.781
CAN HE BE OUR DOCTOR INSTEAD?
(giggles)

11:50.781 --> 11:52.312
UH, DOCTOR.
EXCUSE ME.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.284
HI.
CAN YOU HELP ME?

11:54.284 --> 11:55.245
PLEASE.

11:55.245 --> 11:56.416
(Jackson) WHAT'S UP?

11:56.416 --> 11:58.318
(sighs deeply) YEAH,
THEY'RE DRUNK...

11:58.318 --> 11:59.890
NO, WE'RE NOT.
AND DON'T CARE

11:59.890 --> 12:01.351
THAT THEIR FRIEND HAS
A SERIOUS ABDOMINAL INJURY.

12:01.351 --> 12:02.893
JUST IGNORE THEM.

12:02.893 --> 12:04.394
NO, MY BREASTS ARE SICK.

12:04.394 --> 12:05.996
(coughs)

12:05.996 --> 12:08.298
AND I WAS WONDERING IF YOU
HAD TIME TO GIVE ME AN EXAM.

12:08.298 --> 12:09.329
I NEED ONE, TOO.

12:09.329 --> 12:10.931
ALL RIGHT. ENOUGH.

12:10.931 --> 12:12.763
YOUR FRIEND COULD DIE
IF YOU DON'T START COOPERATING.

12:12.763 --> 12:14.264
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

12:14.264 --> 12:16.066
FINE. JEEZ.

12:16.066 --> 12:17.167
CHILLAX.

12:17.167 --> 12:20.010
WE PRE-PARTIED
WITH LEMON DROPS AT...

12:20.010 --> 12:21.311
O'BRIENS.
MM-HMM.

12:21.311 --> 12:23.743
THEN COSMOS
AT BAR NOUVEAU,

12:23.743 --> 12:25.375
TEQUILA SHOTS AT KAPPA SIG...
(giggling)

12:25.375 --> 12:26.376
SMOKING NIPPLES
AT BRUNCH--

12:26.376 --> 12:28.348
WHAT? WHAT--WHAT WAS THAT?

12:28.348 --> 12:30.020
SMOKING NIPPLE.

12:30.020 --> 12:33.253
SWEET, LOTS OF RUM,
COMES OUT ALL SMOKY.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.926
HOLD ON. LIKE, ACTUAL SMOKE
OR DRY ICE?

12:35.926 --> 12:38.088
(grunts and vomits)

12:38.088 --> 12:39.890
KIMMY!
(whimpers) OH, GOD.

12:39.890 --> 12:42.062
(crying)
(Jackson) LET'S GET HER DOWN.

12:47.467 --> 12:48.799
(cheers and applause)

12:48.799 --> 12:50.200
(Shane) SO HIS WIFE
GOES IN THE BOX.

12:50.200 --> 12:51.401
BUT SOMEWHERE,
THERE'S ANOTHER GIRL.
WHERE?

12:51.401 --> 12:52.372
THAT'S WHAT I CAN'T
FIGURE OUT.

12:52.372 --> 12:53.543
SHE'S ALREADY IN THE BOX.

12:53.543 --> 12:55.005
I KNOW, BUT WHERE?
THERE'S NO ROOM.

12:55.005 --> 12:56.176
LIKE MY NEW APARTMENT.

12:56.176 --> 12:57.507
(chuckles) UH-OH.

12:57.507 --> 12:59.349
LIVING WITH PECKWELL NOT
EVERYTHING YOU HOPED IT'D BE?

12:59.349 --> 13:00.951
(chain saw whirring)
OH, MY GOD.
HERE COMES THE CHAIN SAW.

13:00.951 --> 13:02.352
(muffled shouting)
OH!

13:02.352 --> 13:03.483
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!
OH! I CAN'T WATCH THAT.

13:03.483 --> 13:05.015
OH, MY GOD.
THAT'S AMAZING.

13:05.015 --> 13:07.357
OH, I CAN'T UNSEE THAT.
I CAN'T WATCH IT.

13:07.357 --> 13:08.358
(interns laughing
and speaking indistinctly)

13:08.358 --> 13:09.789
(Heather) OH, THAT WAS AMAZING.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.261
(Jo) I CAN'T WATCH IT.

13:11.261 --> 13:13.323
AW. SOMEONE'S GOT
HIS BUMMER FACE ON.

13:13.323 --> 13:15.325
EVERYWHERE I TURN,
SHE'S THERE.

13:15.325 --> 13:16.867
OH, SO WE'LL WALK THIS WAY.

13:16.867 --> 13:18.198
OH, BUT I HAVE TO GO
THAT WAY.

13:18.198 --> 13:19.329
YEAH, BUT ALEX'S
LITTLE BROKEN HEART

13:19.329 --> 13:21.101
NEEDS TO GO THE LONG WAY.

13:21.101 --> 13:23.273
OH, OKAY. WELL, IF IT'S FOR
ALEX'S LITTLE BROKEN HEART.

13:23.273 --> 13:25.575
ALEX'S LITTLE BROKEN HEART
WISHES YOU BOTH WOULD SHUT UP.

13:25.575 --> 13:27.107
(elevator bell dings)
(chuckles)

13:27.107 --> 13:28.438
SO I'M WORRIED
ABOUT BAILEY.

13:28.438 --> 13:29.579
YOU KNOW SHE'S MAD
AT ALL OF US.

13:29.579 --> 13:31.111
WHY IS SHE MAD AT US?

13:31.111 --> 13:32.282
THE C.D.C. THING.

13:32.282 --> 13:33.513
SHE'S LOCKED HERSELF
IN THAT LAB

13:33.513 --> 13:35.285
AND WILL NOT COME OUT
AND WILL NOT TALK TO ANYONE,

13:35.285 --> 13:37.217
AND THAT'S WEIRD FOR HER.
I'LL TALK TO BAILEY.

13:37.217 --> 13:42.052
YEAH, SEE IF YOU CAN
GET THROUGH TO HER.

13:42.052 --> 13:43.493
WHERE WAS I GOING?

13:43.493 --> 13:46.256
(smartphone chimes)

13:46.256 --> 13:48.358
OH, NO.

13:48.358 --> 13:50.030
(monitor beeping erratically)
WHAT HAPPENED?

13:50.030 --> 13:52.402
ABDOMINAL COMPARTMENT SYNDROME.
ROSS?

13:52.402 --> 13:53.864
SHE'S DISTENDED
AND HEMORRHAGING,

13:53.864 --> 13:55.165
CAUSING HER INTRA-ABDOMINAL
PRESSURE TO SKYROCKET.

13:55.165 --> 13:57.007
WE HAVE TO GET HER BACK
TO THE O.R., STAT.

13:57.007 --> 13:58.438
KAYLA, HONEY,
I'M SORRY.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.310
I'M SO, SO SORRY.

14:00.310 --> 14:02.012
MA'AM, I'M GONNA NEED THE TWO
OF YOU TO PLEASE STEP OUT NOW.

14:02.012 --> 14:03.273
CHERISE, COME ON.
PLEASE DON'T LET HER DIE.
PLEASE SAVE HER.

14:03.273 --> 14:04.875
MA'AM.
PLEASE STEP OUTSIDE. PLEASE.

14:04.875 --> 14:06.516
CHERISE, NOW.
COME ON, CHERISE.
I REALLY NEED YOU TO--

14:06.516 --> 14:07.978
GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF ME,
DANNY!

14:07.978 --> 14:09.319
CHERISE, I'M HER HUSBAND,
OKAY?

14:09.319 --> 14:10.850
I KNOW. I GET IT!
I GET IT!

14:10.850 --> 14:12.282
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING,
DANNY. WE'RE IN LOVE.

14:12.282 --> 14:13.623
WHICH YOU WOULD'VE
FIGURED OUT BY NOW

14:13.623 --> 14:15.155
IF YOU PAID HER
ANY ATTENTION.

14:15.155 --> 14:17.327
SHE WANTED TO LEAVE YOU,
BUT I TOLD HER TO STAY

14:17.327 --> 14:19.930
TILL YOU GOT YOUR FREAKIN' DREAM
OF HAVING A SHOW IN VEGAS.

14:19.930 --> 14:21.591
I DIDN'T LISTEN TO KAYLA
WHEN SHE SAID

14:21.591 --> 14:23.333
SHE WAS DYING IN THE MARRIAGE,

14:41.451 --> 14:43.453
SO WHY HASN'T HE WOKEN UP?

14:43.453 --> 14:46.386
YEAH. I-I-I'VE ASKED
EVERY DOCTOR IN THE HOSPITAL

14:46.386 --> 14:47.517
FOR THEIR OPINION,

14:47.517 --> 14:49.889
AND NO ONE HAS ANY IDEAS.

14:52.222 --> 14:54.464
OH, MY GOD.
YOU'RE RIGHT. GO GLOBAL.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.019
LISTEN, I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU'RE MAD.

15:19.019 --> 15:20.650

FOR YOU TO BE MAD ALONE.

16:08.638 --> 16:10.000
WHAT'S YOUR PLAN HERE?
A ROUX-en-Y.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.002
I'M GONNA REMOVE
THE STOMACH COMPLETELY

16:12.002 --> 16:14.344
AND THEN REATTACH
THE INTESTINE TO THE ESOPHAGUS.

16:14.344 --> 16:16.276

SO I PAGED BAILEY.

16:16.276 --> 16:18.408
BAILEY'S NOT OPERATING.
WEBBER'S TAKING HER CASES.

16:18.408 --> 16:20.750

16:20.750 --> 16:23.383

BUT THE THING I'VE LEARNED FROM
HIDING OUT IS, IT DOESN'T WORK.

22:28.618 --> 22:29.679
AND, BAILEY,
WE NEED YOU.

22:29.679 --> 22:31.080
(door opens)

22:31.080 --> 22:32.782
THIS HOSPITAL DOES NOT WORK
WITHOUT YOU.

22:32.782 --> 22:34.384
(lock clicks)
(Arizona) OH.

22:34.384 --> 22:35.585
(sighs)

22:35.585 --> 22:36.756
(smartphone chimes)

22:36.756 --> 22:38.488
9-1-1 IN THE E.R.
GOTTA GO.

22:41.791 --> 22:43.793
GUESS WHAT, LADY.
THIS ISN'T EVEN YOUR LAB.

22:43.793 --> 22:46.866
OKAY? WE BOUGHT IT FOR YOU.

22:46.866 --> 22:48.768
(lowered voice)
WAS IT TOO MUCH?

22:48.768 --> 22:49.939
YEAH.

22:49.939 --> 22:51.471
(inhales sharply)

22:51.471 --> 22:53.142
(mouths word)

22:53.142 --> 22:54.644
WHAT'S GOING ON?
(siren wailing)

22:54.644 --> 22:56.446
HE GOT INTO
HIS GRANDMA'S SLEEPING PILLS.

22:56.446 --> 22:58.147
UNRESPONSIVE.
B.P. 74 SYSTOLIC.

22:58.147 --> 22:59.949
OKAY, LET'S GET HIM
TO TRAUMA ROOM ONE.

22:59.949 --> 23:01.481
LET'S PREP
FOR A GASTRIC LAVAGE.

23:01.481 --> 23:03.112
NO! YOU'RE TOO CLOSE TO THIS.
I GOT IT.

23:03.112 --> 23:05.655
ALL RIGHT, LET'S, UH,
START A FLUMAZENIL DRIP, NOW.

23:05.655 --> 23:07.517
(crying)
WHEN I WOKE UP FROM MY NAP...

23:07.517 --> 23:10.560
(sniffles) HE WAS ON THE FLOOR.
I COULDN'T WAKE HIM.

23:10.560 --> 23:11.861
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

23:11.861 --> 23:14.664
SHE IS LEGALLY OBLIGATED
TO CONTACT SOCIAL SERVICES.

23:14.664 --> 23:16.165
IT--IT WAS AN ACCIDENT--

23:16.165 --> 23:18.468
HE TOOK AN OVERDOSE, NANCY.
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

23:18.468 --> 23:19.629
WERE YOU THINKING?

23:19.629 --> 23:22.071
PLEASE, HE CAN'T DIE.
OH, GOD.

23:22.071 --> 23:24.934
(continues crying)
HE CAN'T DIE, TOO.

23:24.934 --> 23:27.006
HE CAN'T.

23:27.006 --> 23:28.508
(continues crying)

23:28.508 --> 23:30.079
(sighs)

23:36.015 --> 23:37.447
(woman) DR. MEADOW
TO LABOR AND DELIVERY.

23:37.447 --> 23:38.648
DR. MEADOW, LABOR AND DELIVERY.

23:38.648 --> 23:39.619
IS HE STABLE?

23:39.619 --> 23:41.120
I THINK SO.

23:41.120 --> 23:42.722
(indistinct conversations)

23:42.722 --> 23:43.993
(exhales)

23:43.993 --> 23:45.795
WE'RE STILL MONITORING HIM.

23:45.795 --> 23:48.157
BUT WE GOT HIM IN TIME TO
ADMINISTER THE FLUMAZENIL

23:48.157 --> 23:50.700
TO REVERSE THE EFFECTS
OF THE ZOLPIDEM.

23:50.700 --> 23:52.161
SO HOPEFULLY,
HE'LL WAKE UP SOON.

23:52.161 --> 23:54.504
OKAY. LISTEN,
ABOUT THE SOCIAL SERVICES--

23:54.504 --> 23:55.705
I ALREADY CALLED THEM.

23:55.705 --> 23:58.137
THE SOCIAL WORKER'S
ON HER WAY.

24:00.139 --> 24:02.141
(sighs)

24:02.141 --> 24:04.614
(wailing continues)

24:04.614 --> 24:05.975
IT'S A GABA AGONIST.

24:05.975 --> 24:07.517
YEAH.

24:07.517 --> 24:10.079
OWEN, ZOLPIDEM
IS A GABA AGONIST.

24:10.079 --> 24:12.221
WE CAN REVERSE THE EFFECTS.

24:12.221 --> 24:14.724
(wailing continues)

24:14.724 --> 24:16.225
WAIT. WE WANT HIM TO WAKE UP.

24:16.225 --> 24:17.727
SO WHY ARE WE GIVING HIM
SLEEPING PILLS?

24:17.727 --> 24:20.129
UH, ZOLPIDEM TRIGGERS
THE GABA PATHWAY,

24:20.129 --> 24:21.631
CAUSING DROWSINESS
IN NORMAL BRAINS.

24:21.631 --> 24:23.963
WHERE THE CHEMICAL BALANCE
HAS BEEN DISTURBED,

24:23.963 --> 24:26.195
STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE DRUG
CAN REVERSE THE EFFECT.

24:26.195 --> 24:27.737
THIS COULD ACTUALLY
WAKE HIM UP?

24:27.737 --> 24:29.739
(Steph) SO HOW LONG
BEFORE WE--

24:29.739 --> 24:31.601
ALL THE CASES SAID
IT TOOK ONLY MINUTES.

24:31.601 --> 24:34.904

24:46.115 --> 24:48.558
IS SHE GONNA BE OKAY?

24:48.558 --> 24:51.961
UM... THE NEXT 24 HOURS
IS GONNA BE CRITICAL.

24:51.961 --> 24:54.724
I'M HOPING TO SEE HER LIVER
AND KIDNEY FUNCTION IMPROVE.

24:54.724 --> 24:55.895
SO SHE'S OUT OF THE WOODS?

24:55.895 --> 24:57.066
HE DIDN'T SAY THAT,
DANNY.

24:57.066 --> 24:59.098
(Meredith) OKAY, YOU TWO,
STOP IT.

24:59.098 --> 25:01.030
STOP FIGHTING.

25:01.030 --> 25:03.072
WHATEVER HAPPENED,
WHATEVER THE HISTORY,

25:03.072 --> 25:04.574
YOU NEED TO GET OVER IT.

25:04.574 --> 25:06.976
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

25:06.976 --> 25:08.808

HE PUT A VAMPIRE

28:12.391 --> 28:13.863

MAYBE SHE'LL BE BETTER.

28:13.863 --> 28:15.865
I MEAN, IF SHE CAN EAT
WITHOUT A STOMACH,

28:15.865 --> 28:17.366
SHE CAN PROBABLY STILL DRINK.

28:17.366 --> 28:19.729

PLUS SHE'LL BE SUPER THIN.

28:19.729 --> 28:21.700
NO.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.472
NO, SHE CAN'T DRINK.

28:26.435 --> 28:27.977

PUT THE DEPOSIT DOWN

28:27.977 --> 28:29.478

YEAH.

28:29.478 --> 28:32.211
THEN... GO TO THE CONDO

28:32.211 --> 28:34.013
STUDY.

28:39.448 --> 28:41.951
HELP EACH OTHER GET GOOD GRADES

28:41.951 --> 28:43.422
DON'T YOU WANT TO BE AWESOME?

28:43.422 --> 28:45.755
UM... TOTALLY.

28:50.399 --> 28:52.061

28:56.205 --> 28:58.037
IS IT--IS IT WEIRD THAT ALL
I WANT TO DO RIGHT NOW

28:58.037 --> 28:59.408
IS GO FOR A DRINK?

28:59.408 --> 29:01.440
OH.
HEY, YOU WANT TO GO TO JOE'S?

29:04.243 --> 29:05.744
NO...

29:05.744 --> 29:07.376
ACTUALLY, THANKS.

29:07.376 --> 29:09.748
I-I HAVE SOMETHING.
I HAVE PLANS.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.520
SO...

29:11.520 --> 29:13.923
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I JUST... I JUST REMEMBERED,

29:13.923 --> 29:16.425
I'M SUPPOSED TO MEET UP
WITH MATTHEW ANYWAY, SO...

29:16.425 --> 29:19.028
MAYBE ANOTHER TIME?

29:19.028 --> 29:21.330
YEAH. GOOD NIGHT.

(woman speaking indistinctly)

29:39.778 --> 29:41.080
DAMN IT.

29:41.080 --> 29:42.511
GIVE IT ANOTHER MINUTE.

29:42.511 --> 29:45.284
SOME PATIENTS WOKE UP
AFTER FIVE MINUTES. OTHERS--

29:45.284 --> 29:46.785
CRISTINA,
IT'S BEEN AN HOUR.

29:46.785 --> 29:49.058
AND THERE'S
A SOCIAL WORKER DOWNSTAIRS

29:49.058 --> 29:51.120
WAITING TO TAKE ETHAN AWAY.

30:00.269 --> 30:03.402
DR. BAILEY.

30:03.402 --> 30:05.474
I PUT A WOMAN BACK TOGETHER
TODAY, BAILEY.

30:05.474 --> 30:09.108
SHE WAS SPLIT IN TWO,
AND I FIXED HER.

30:09.108 --> 30:12.411
DR. WEBBER AND I--
WE FIXED HER.

30:12.411 --> 30:13.983
(sighs)

30:13.983 --> 30:15.985
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU TWO,

30:15.985 --> 30:18.387
BUT YOU NEED TO STOP IT.

30:18.387 --> 30:20.219
IT'S CHILDISH

30:20.219 --> 30:23.552
AND SELFISH.

30:23.552 --> 30:26.355
YOU NEED TO STOP.

30:28.557 --> 30:30.900
DR. BAILEY.

30:35.034 --> 30:36.435
(Meredith sighs)

30:44.443 --> 30:48.077
(Miranda) IT'S AN UNUSUALLY
AGGRESSIVE INFECTION.

30:49.518 --> 30:51.420
DO YOU HAVE MY RESULTS?

30:51.420 --> 30:53.152
(inhales deeply)

30:53.152 --> 30:54.453
(Richard) THE INFECTION CAME
FROM ONE DOCTOR,

30:54.453 --> 30:56.155
AND ONE DOCTOR ALONE.

30:56.155 --> 30:57.386
SHE'S BEEN ISOLATED

30:57.386 --> 30:58.888
AND THE INFECTION
HAS BEEN CONTAINED.

30:58.888 --> 31:00.229
(Owen) THIS IS GOING TO BE
A NIGHTMARE.

31:00.229 --> 31:01.560
(Miranda) FIRST PATIENT--
JOYCE BASCHE--

31:01.560 --> 31:03.192
SHE DIDN'T MAKE IT.

31:03.192 --> 31:06.065
(man) DR. MIRANDA BAILEY IS
A CARRIER OF MRSA USA600.

31:06.065 --> 31:07.866
(Meredith) THE ONLY DOCTOR WHO
TOUCHED ALL THREE PATIENTS...

31:07.866 --> 31:09.538
(man) DID YOU SCRUB?
WAS YOU.

31:09.538 --> 31:11.100
FOR HOW LONG DID YOU SCRUB?

31:11.100 --> 31:12.501
(Miranda) IT'S AN UNUSUALLY
AGGRESSIVE INFECTION.

31:12.501 --> 31:13.973
(Richard)
...AND ONE DOCTOR ONLY.

31:13.973 --> 31:15.304
(Miranda) BUT WE'RE GONNA
TAKE CARE OF HER.

31:15.304 --> 31:16.545
(man) DID YOU SCRUB?
(Meredith) IT'S A THIRD ONE.

31:16.545 --> 31:17.907
(Miranda) YOU HAVE MY RESULTS.

31:17.907 --> 31:19.408
CAN YOU GET ME MY RESULTS,
PLEASE?

31:19.408 --> 31:20.980
(man)
FOR HOW LONG DID YOU SCRUB?
(crying) I DID.

31:20.980 --> 31:22.111
(Richard) ...ONE DOCTOR ALONE.
SHE'S BEEN ISOLATED.

31:22.111 --> 31:23.282
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY...

31:23.282 --> 31:24.613
I HAVE THE STRAIN
OF STAPH?

31:24.613 --> 31:26.285
...P.M.

31:26.285 --> 31:29.018
(Miranda crying) DID I DO THIS?

31:31.160 --> 31:33.362
DID I DO THIS?

31:33.362 --> 31:36.165
DID I DO THIS?

31:36.165 --> 31:38.567
(sets Petri dish down)

31:56.946 --> 31:59.918
(indistinct conversations)

32:03.622 --> 32:05.354
HEY.

32:07.596 --> 32:09.999
YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED?

32:09.999 --> 32:13.532
I JUST...
WANTED TO GO TO SLEEP.

32:13.532 --> 32:15.034
ETHAN, YOU KNOW
HOW DANGEROUS IT IS

32:15.034 --> 32:16.535
TO TAKE MEDICINE
THAT ISN'T YOURS?

32:16.535 --> 32:18.037
YOU COULD'VE DIED.

32:18.037 --> 32:22.441
NEVER TAKE ANY PILLS
WITHOUT A PARENT'S PERMISSION.

32:22.441 --> 32:25.574
I DON'T THINK I HAVE
ANY PARENTS ANYMORE.

32:27.376 --> 32:29.348
HEY. HEY, THAT'S...

32:35.554 --> 32:37.226

TRYING ANYTHING?

32:37.226 --> 32:38.587
WE ARE.

32:38.587 --> 32:40.629
WE'RE TRYING
EVERYTHING WE CAN THINK OF

32:40.629 --> 32:42.631
TO WAKE HIM UP, ETHAN.

32:42.631 --> 32:44.963
WE HAVEN'T GIVEN UP ON HIM.

32:44.963 --> 32:47.566

EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES,

33:35.214 --> 33:38.717

YOU CAN DO THIS.

33:42.091 --> 33:45.654

A PLACE TO RUN,

33:49.598 --> 33:51.130
AND A SCHOOL.

33:51.130 --> 33:53.332
I-I CAN'T EVEN DRIVE ANYMORE.
I HAVE CATARACTS.

33:53.332 --> 33:56.065

MY HUSBAND AT THE FACILITY--

33:56.065 --> 33:58.107

ANYONE IN THE FAMILY--

33:58.107 --> 34:00.409

34:00.409 --> 34:02.171

34:34.403 --> 34:37.075
