00:01.134 --> 00:03.035
(siren wailing,
cell phone vibrates)

00:03.037 --> 00:04.169
Dr. Reid.

00:04.171 --> 00:05.437
(man) <i>the</i> dr. Reid?

00:05.439 --> 00:06.739
The pretty one,

00:06.741 --> 00:08.540
Prone to perfection
and deep insecurities?

00:08.542 --> 00:11.577
No, this is the one who told you
not to call me when I'm working.

00:11.579 --> 00:14.546
Listen, girlie,
I needs my licorice, okay?

00:14.548 --> 00:16.382
It's been too long.

00:16.384 --> 00:18.617
So just bring me... Two packs
should fill the void, all right?

00:18.619 --> 00:19.785
Just bring it along
with you.

00:19.787 --> 00:22.254
Nothing is gonna fill
your void.

00:22.256 --> 00:23.722
Now some people
have to work. Bye.
Don't hang up! Don't hang up!
I need you!

00:23.724 --> 00:25.391
(touch screen clicks)
suspected pulmonary embolism.

00:25.393 --> 00:27.593
A young woman was taken
from a plane by island airport.

00:27.595 --> 00:30.496
Emergency landing. E.M.T.S got
there, stabilized her,

00:30.498 --> 00:32.231
And then they radioed ahead,

00:32.233 --> 00:35.634
Suggesting that we segregate her
in an e.R. Room.
Mm.

00:35.636 --> 00:37.469
Is she contagious or something?

00:37.471 --> 00:40.072
Female, age 21, ab-negative.
That's all we got.

00:40.074 --> 00:42.141
Okay.

00:42.143 --> 00:44.276
(woman) mm!
She didn't get transferred
to five prisons in nine months

00:44.278 --> 00:46.311
'cause she's miss congeniality.

00:46.313 --> 00:47.346
How long was the flight?

00:47.348 --> 00:49.048
Three hours from edmonton.

00:49.050 --> 00:50.549
Was she wearing handcuffs
the whole time?
(grunts)

00:50.551 --> 00:51.717
Why's that matter?

00:51.719 --> 00:53.285
Restraints make d.V.T.
A greater risk,

00:53.287 --> 00:55.154
And then it's boom--
straight to the lungs.

00:55.156 --> 00:57.089
(woman grunting)
she was cuffed for two hours
before the flight...

00:57.091 --> 00:58.357
(woman) let me go!
And then on the plane, we, uh...

00:58.359 --> 01:00.793
Uhh!
Taped her to her seat.

01:00.795 --> 01:02.061
With duct tape?

01:02.063 --> 01:03.762
It's got a million uses.

01:03.764 --> 01:05.397
Better that
than she start bleeding...
No one touch me!

01:05.399 --> 01:07.132
From trying to wriggle out
of her cuffs, right?

01:07.134 --> 01:08.634
Yeah, well,
we'll take over from here.

01:08.636 --> 01:10.235
One, two, three. (grunts)

01:10.237 --> 01:13.772
Get her sedated before trying to
to do any kind of examination.

01:13.774 --> 01:15.374
She's no use to me
when she's sedated.
Get away from me!

01:15.376 --> 01:16.775
I need her answering me
while I'm examining her.

01:16.777 --> 01:18.510
Give her the once-over
and let's get her mellow.

01:18.512 --> 01:20.279
I don't want you risking
your life here.

01:20.281 --> 01:21.747
I need these cuffs off.
It's not a good idea.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.582
(machinery beeps)
she may be your prisoner,

01:23.584 --> 01:25.284
But right now,
she's my patient...
(woman groans)

01:25.286 --> 01:27.653
And I can't examine her
in restraints.
Let me out!

01:27.655 --> 01:29.421
Hey, lilly. Lilly.
Mm.

01:29.423 --> 01:30.556
How'd you break your ankle?

01:30.558 --> 01:31.790
Mm.
Like I said,

01:31.792 --> 01:34.126
She's violent
and out-of-control.

01:34.128 --> 01:35.594
You know what?

01:35.596 --> 01:37.129
We're gonna have to ask you
to step outside, please.

01:37.131 --> 01:39.098
Step back to the waiting room!
Thank you!

01:39.100 --> 01:40.599
(machinery beeping)

01:40.601 --> 01:42.101
(radio chatter)

01:42.103 --> 01:44.236
Zach?
What?

01:44.238 --> 01:45.771
Me, too?

01:45.773 --> 01:48.640
I just think she would be more
comfortable if it was just me.

01:48.642 --> 01:50.576
Right. Well, just, you know,
remember what happened

01:50.578 --> 01:52.544
To galton at the general?
Prisoner beat him with a bedpan.

01:52.546 --> 01:55.114
(gasps)
zach, I can handle this.

01:55.116 --> 01:58.550
Just, you know, guy's still
eatin' through a straw.

01:58.552 --> 02:00.252
(lilly groans)

02:00.254 --> 02:01.720
Okay, lilly,
it's just you and me, okay?

02:01.722 --> 02:03.288
Try to relax.

02:03.290 --> 02:04.790
(strained voice)
what did they inject me with?

02:04.792 --> 02:06.658
Why does it hurt so much?

02:06.660 --> 02:08.794
That's what I'm trying
to figure out.
Mm!

02:08.796 --> 02:13.866
Uhh! Is my cast making it worse?
'cause my leg is killing me.

02:13.868 --> 02:15.534
Just gonna have a look, okay?

02:15.536 --> 02:16.802
Is this tender?

02:16.804 --> 02:18.203
Uhh!

02:18.205 --> 02:20.739
Okay. Okay.
(cries)

02:20.741 --> 02:22.908
(panting)

02:22.910 --> 02:26.378
I look over, and pretty boy here
is bawling his eyes out.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.147
It was a 4-hanky film.

02:28.149 --> 02:29.615
He had to borrow tissues
from the old lady next to us.

02:29.617 --> 02:32.518
I'm not afraid to show emotions,
so I cried.

02:32.520 --> 02:33.919
I think it's kind of sweet.

02:33.921 --> 02:36.722
Besides, tears are cathartic.
They are a purgative.

02:36.724 --> 02:38.624
They allow you to drain off
excess emotion.

02:38.626 --> 02:41.160
Actually, that's wrong.

02:41.162 --> 02:42.361
Yeah, cornelius' work proved

02:42.363 --> 02:43.762
That tears serve
a psychological function

02:43.764 --> 02:45.697
And act as a primal method
of communicating.

02:45.699 --> 02:47.866
Like a child crying
for its mother?
Exactly.

02:47.868 --> 02:50.435
Well, the only person
who had a dry eye in that house

02:50.437 --> 02:52.437
Was maggie.

02:52.439 --> 02:53.672
You know what?
Come to think of it,

02:53.674 --> 02:54.840
I don't think I've ever
seen you cry.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.175
I...

02:56.177 --> 02:57.609
Hey, charlie.

02:57.611 --> 02:58.877
Hey.
Where's the game?

02:58.879 --> 03:00.379
Morgue.

03:00.381 --> 03:02.381
Can I play?
Yep.

03:05.451 --> 03:08.654
(drill whirring)

03:08.656 --> 03:11.423
(whirring stops)

03:11.425 --> 03:13.225
(blows air) thanks
to this generous donor,

03:13.227 --> 03:15.227
We've got first dibs
on two prime femurs,

03:15.229 --> 03:16.962
Two sweet tibias,

03:16.964 --> 03:19.798
And enough cartilage
for a dozen transplants.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.200
So we harvest the bones

03:21.202 --> 03:22.568
And replace them
with hockey sticks?

03:22.570 --> 03:23.869
Yes.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.904
Because of him,
a boy will play football,

03:25.906 --> 03:27.372
A dancer will pirouette,

03:27.374 --> 03:28.774
And a lover will
go down on bended knee.

03:28.776 --> 03:30.576
Hmm. You've thought this
through.

03:30.578 --> 03:32.311
Yeah, well, I'm usually alone
in the morgue

03:32.313 --> 03:34.880
When I'm doing retrieval,
so it helps to see the upside.

03:36.516 --> 03:39.618
<i>Of all the morgues in all</i>
<i>the hospitals in the world,</i>

03:39.620 --> 03:41.453
<i>I had to end up here.</i>

03:42.922 --> 03:44.356
Excuse me?

03:44.358 --> 03:45.857
I didn't say anything.

03:45.859 --> 03:47.392
<i>Get her out of here.</i>

03:47.394 --> 03:48.727
<i>I can't let her see me</i>
<i>like this.</i>

03:48.729 --> 03:51.697
<i>She's my daughter.</i>

03:55.568 --> 03:56.735
Uh...

03:56.737 --> 03:58.270
Whoa. Dr. Lin?

03:58.272 --> 03:59.938
Yes?
<i>Yes.</i>

03:59.940 --> 04:03.942
Oh. (blows air) ho ho!
Oh, ho ho. Oh, ho ho.

04:03.944 --> 04:05.277
Uh...

04:05.279 --> 04:06.511
I-I just remembered.

04:06.513 --> 04:09.248
Uh, I've got a consult

04:09.250 --> 04:10.515
Five minutes ago.

04:10.517 --> 04:13.619
Um... Rain check this.

04:13.621 --> 04:14.820
If it's just a matter
of harvesting,

04:14.822 --> 04:16.021
I'm sure I could manage.

04:16.023 --> 04:18.423
Oh, no. No.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

04:18.425 --> 04:19.691
Uh, it's--it's--
it's, like, um...

04:19.693 --> 04:20.993
It's like cutting down
a christmas tree.

04:20.995 --> 04:23.362
It has much more value
if I do this myself.

04:23.364 --> 04:24.696
But, um...
(sticks clatter)

04:24.698 --> 04:26.365
Why don't you come with me?

04:26.367 --> 04:28.367
We'll, um, we'll do the--
the consult, uh, together.

04:28.369 --> 04:31.370
You can help me consult in...

04:31.372 --> 04:34.773
So far, I don't see any evidence
of a blockage.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.008
Uhh!

04:36.010 --> 04:38.277
Wait.

04:38.279 --> 04:40.345
What?
An occlusive thrombus,

04:40.347 --> 04:42.881
Which means
your vein is clogged up.

04:46.953 --> 04:49.788
Uhh! (choking)

04:49.790 --> 04:51.523

in two weeks.

05:21.789 --> 05:23.722
Okay.
Let me take a look.

05:23.724 --> 05:25.724
Oh! You look beautiful.

05:25.726 --> 05:27.392
All right, we'll see you.

05:27.394 --> 05:29.494
See you later.
Dana.

05:29.496 --> 05:30.896
How are ya?

05:30.898 --> 05:32.998
Joel.
It's so nice.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.333
Nice?
Mm-hmm.

05:34.335 --> 05:35.734
Really?
That's your best line?

05:35.736 --> 05:37.369
Well...

05:37.371 --> 05:38.870
Mm, you are never gonna make it
in the private sector.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.072
I mean, look around.

05:40.074 --> 05:41.473
We built this place
on botox, silicone,

05:41.475 --> 05:43.408
And fawning compliments.

05:43.410 --> 05:44.910
Come here.

05:44.912 --> 05:46.745
Do I sense a little regret?

05:46.747 --> 05:48.413
Regret? Not a bit.

05:48.415 --> 05:49.915
Yeah?
Take a look.

05:49.917 --> 05:51.383
So can I get you something?

05:51.385 --> 05:53.518

What are you doing here?

05:58.559 --> 06:00.125
What?
What are you doing here?

06:00.127 --> 06:02.361
You're not cut out for
this high priced nonsense.

you don't miss hope zion.

06:04.565 --> 06:05.964
What,
miss that old boy's club

06:05.966 --> 06:08.800
Where I was passed over
as chief of surgery?

06:08.802 --> 06:11.403
No, I don't miss it a bit.

06:11.405 --> 06:14.740
And I'm not going back
if that's what you're asking.

06:14.742 --> 06:16.108
One surgery.

06:16.110 --> 06:17.943
Something only you could do.

06:17.945 --> 06:20.145
And look, I know you're busy.
I don't like to ask--

06:20.147 --> 06:23.448
Then don't, because I'm booked
into the next millennium.

06:23.450 --> 06:24.983
Okay. Okay.

06:24.985 --> 06:26.585
All right.

06:26.587 --> 06:27.753
So we better get going
if we're gonna have lunch.

06:27.755 --> 06:29.721
I'm meeting my architect
at 2:00.

06:29.723 --> 06:30.856
Okay.

06:30.858 --> 06:32.691
Thank you.

06:32.693 --> 06:35.160

06:35.162 --> 06:37.028
If this is an accurate account
of events,

06:37.030 --> 06:39.598
You can just sign
right there.

06:39.600 --> 06:40.732
What is it?

06:40.734 --> 06:42.067
It's an incident report.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.469
It's required when there's been
an incident.

06:44.471 --> 06:46.638
Yeah, the hospital
has me do one, too.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.940
Yeah, the taser delivers
50,000 volts,

06:48.942 --> 06:51.676
But the paperwork's worse.

06:51.678 --> 06:52.811
Thank you.

06:52.813 --> 06:54.012
Welcome.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.017
As requested.

06:59.019 --> 07:02.554
From my experience, most of
these criminals are malingerers.

07:02.556 --> 07:04.423
Hospital is just a vacation
to them.

07:04.425 --> 07:06.124
She's hardly faking it.

07:06.126 --> 07:08.026
Granted, her d-dimer's high,

07:08.028 --> 07:09.628
But we always get
crazy fibrin levels

07:09.630 --> 07:11.029
If there's broken bones.

07:11.031 --> 07:12.831
Her wells score is a 7.

07:12.833 --> 07:16.101
Look, joel's on a warpath
about unnecessary testing.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.503
It's a 7.
We don't have a choice.

07:18.505 --> 07:20.205
(sighs) okay.

07:20.207 --> 07:22.941
I'll run her up to
c.T. Angio for you.

Don't they restrict
your phone use?

07:30.184 --> 07:32.083

I'm a very charming fellow,

07:32.085 --> 07:33.618
Because others <i>do.</i>

07:33.620 --> 07:35.654
They hear my story.
They long to help.

07:35.656 --> 07:37.456
Don't call me
during working hours.

07:37.458 --> 07:39.491
Don't bark at me. I'm sensitive.

07:39.493 --> 07:41.860
Now are you gonna pick me up
from this hell or send a limo?

07:41.862 --> 07:44.896
What part of "no"
didn't you understand?

07:44.898 --> 07:46.465
(touch screen clicks)

07:46.467 --> 07:47.866
Problem?

07:47.868 --> 07:49.501
I can handle it.

07:49.503 --> 07:52.070
I mean, aside from being bitten
by a prisoner.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.205
It was no biggie.

07:53.207 --> 07:54.639
No, come here.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.575
Coat off, please.

07:56.577 --> 07:57.642
Charlie...
Alex.

07:57.644 --> 08:00.512
Look. The bite hardly pierced
the skin.

08:00.514 --> 08:03.715
You were bitten by an inmate
from a prison awash in hep-c.

08:03.717 --> 08:05.050
If her blood panel
comes back positive,

08:05.052 --> 08:08.620
You're gonna be on interferon
for a year.

08:08.622 --> 08:09.754
Now...

08:09.756 --> 08:10.922
(siren wailing)

08:10.924 --> 08:12.891
(laughs)
deep breath.

08:12.893 --> 08:15.227
(inhales deeply) okay.

08:17.196 --> 08:19.197
You're not getting sick
on my watch.

08:19.199 --> 08:21.700
Thank you, doctor.

08:21.702 --> 08:23.768
(laughs)

08:23.770 --> 08:26.238
(various machines beep)
zach.

08:27.940 --> 08:29.508
(beep)

08:29.510 --> 08:30.976
That, uh, that bone donor
down in the morgue--

08:30.978 --> 08:32.110
What can you tell me
about him?

08:32.112 --> 08:33.778
Uh, massive heart attack.

08:33.780 --> 08:35.146
Guy was dead when
the paramedics brought him in.

08:35.148 --> 08:37.115
You know how those guys hate
to pronounce.

08:37.117 --> 08:39.150
So you signed
the death certificate?

08:39.152 --> 08:40.819
Uh, well, yeah, I gave him
a full resus,

08:40.821 --> 08:42.954
And he was warm and dead
when I finally declared.

08:42.956 --> 08:46.057
Gave him a celestial release.

08:48.294 --> 08:50.195
Did the paramedics happen
to mention

08:50.197 --> 08:51.296
Where they picked him up?

08:51.298 --> 08:52.764
<i>Is this really necessary?</i>

08:52.766 --> 08:54.799
He was at a rub and tug

08:54.801 --> 08:58.603
When the cruel hand of fate
yanked his chain.

08:58.605 --> 08:59.738
<i>Happy now?</i>

08:59.740 --> 09:01.940
He died at a massage parlor?

09:01.942 --> 09:04.276
Which I imagine has gotta be
like dying all alone, you know?

09:04.278 --> 09:05.944
It certainly lacks poetry,
yeah.

09:05.946 --> 09:07.946
Mind you...

09:07.948 --> 09:09.548
I've seen worse.

09:09.550 --> 09:12.684
You never twigged that it was
maggie's dad?

09:12.686 --> 09:13.952
He's <i>that...</i>
<i>Yep.</i>

09:13.954 --> 09:16.221
World-famous dr. Lin? No.

09:16.223 --> 09:17.556
Yep.
Really?

09:17.558 --> 09:19.724
Yep.
Does she know?

09:19.726 --> 09:21.126
No.

09:21.128 --> 09:23.728
Mnh.

09:31.804 --> 09:33.204
Look, I, uh,
I hope you don't mind.

09:33.206 --> 09:34.906
I took the liberty of
ordering ahead. Thank you.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.341
Oh. Oh!

09:36.343 --> 09:37.609
Um, I wasn't sure
on whether or not you preferred

09:37.611 --> 09:39.044
Spicy or mild,
so I got both.
Mmm.

09:39.046 --> 09:40.712
Um, this is alicha wat.

09:40.714 --> 09:41.846
Mm-hmm.

09:41.848 --> 09:43.582
Uh, this is mild.

09:43.584 --> 09:44.916
After all we've been through,
that's how you see me?

09:44.918 --> 09:47.752
No. I know you only pretend
to be conventional.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.120
So let's, uh, try this one.

09:49.122 --> 09:51.356
This is, uh, key wat.

09:51.358 --> 09:53.725
It's got a little bit
more kick to it.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.794
Here.
(laughs).

09:55.796 --> 09:56.895
Joel?
What?

09:56.897 --> 09:58.630
You don't have to feed me.

09:58.632 --> 10:01.833
No. This is the custom.
This is called, uh, <i>gursha.</i>

10:01.835 --> 10:03.902
It's like,
the bigger the <i>gursha,</i>

10:03.904 --> 10:05.637
The bigger the--the bond
between us.

10:05.639 --> 10:07.606
Oh, that's right. You were
in ethiopia, weren't you?

10:07.608 --> 10:08.907
Weren't you at one
of the refugee camps?

10:08.909 --> 10:11.009
Yeah, in sherkole
and bambassi, actually.

10:11.011 --> 10:13.612
But try it.
Okay.

10:13.614 --> 10:15.614
That's it. Mm.

10:15.616 --> 10:16.815
Joel.

10:18.751 --> 10:20.919
I just--
I-I think we should

10:20.921 --> 10:24.289
Kind of keep our <i>gurshas</i>
<i>to ourselves, if that's okay.</i>

10:26.025 --> 10:27.759
All right. (sighs)

10:27.761 --> 10:29.894
Salud.
Mm-hmm.

10:29.896 --> 10:33.898
<i>â™ª</i>

10:33.900 --> 10:36.868
Mmm!

10:36.870 --> 10:38.203
Mmm!
(chuckles)

10:38.205 --> 10:39.638
(mouth full) oh!
That's not bad.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.106
What is that spice?

10:41.108 --> 10:42.173
Berbere.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.309
A sort of barbecue rub.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.311
It's a... Oh.
Hey, man.

10:46.313 --> 10:47.746
(lowered voice)
told you she'd come.

10:47.748 --> 10:48.913
(normal voice)
so, um, this is dembele.

10:48.915 --> 10:50.181
Uh, dana.

10:50.183 --> 10:52.183
Uh, dembele's actually
a line cook here,

10:52.185 --> 10:54.686
But he prepared
all of this today for us.

10:54.688 --> 10:57.422
Dembele? That's, um,
that's a lovely name.

10:57.424 --> 10:59.057
And an old one in my country.
Mm-hmm.

10:59.059 --> 11:00.191
I'm from mali.

11:00.193 --> 11:01.926
Yeah, but don't let that
fool you.

11:01.928 --> 11:03.895
He's <i>the</i> single greatest
ethiopian chef in town.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.096
How'd that happen?

11:05.098 --> 11:06.231
I walked to ethiopia.

11:06.233 --> 11:07.699
From mali?
Yes.

11:07.701 --> 11:09.934
I got very hungry
and I learned to cook.

11:09.936 --> 11:11.936
(laughs) you...

11:11.938 --> 11:14.973
<i>â™ª</i>

11:14.975 --> 11:16.908
Well, this is delicious.
Thank you.

11:16.910 --> 11:18.977
Thank you so much, man.

11:22.048 --> 11:23.848
Joel.
Yeah?

11:23.850 --> 11:25.817
He has facial paralysis.

11:25.819 --> 11:28.253
Only on one side.

11:28.255 --> 11:29.821
It's not total, okay?

11:29.823 --> 11:31.790
And you brought me here
just to see him.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.224
That's not true.

11:33.226 --> 11:35.026
To enjoy the delicious food
and wonderful company.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.295
This is the guy you wanted me
to operate on, right?

11:37.297 --> 11:38.963
I don't believe this.

11:38.965 --> 11:40.899
Dana, this is <i>one</i> surgery,
all right?
Oh!

11:40.901 --> 11:43.034
Oh!
It's a few hours away from
that moneymaking machine

11:43.036 --> 11:45.970
That you call a practice,
and he...

11:45.972 --> 11:47.405
Dana, you can help him.

11:47.407 --> 11:49.841
Joel, I'm sorry,

11:49.843 --> 11:52.310
But I am done
with that hospital.

11:59.118 --> 12:00.885
(alex) talk to me.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.954
She's desatting.

12:02.956 --> 12:05.390
Lilly, I'm just gonna do
a brief examination, okay?

12:05.392 --> 12:07.859
(jackson)
look at the color of the blood.

12:07.861 --> 12:09.394
Yeah.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.496
And her cervix is patulous.

12:11.498 --> 12:13.264
Call code omega.

12:13.266 --> 12:15.166
Hang blood and initiate
massive transfusion protocols.

12:15.168 --> 12:18.470
4 units f.F.P.,
2 milligrams of I.V. Vitamin k,

12:18.472 --> 12:20.805
And then let's run coags,
c.B.C.S, thrombin time,

12:20.807 --> 12:23.775
And check fibrinogen again.

12:23.777 --> 12:25.443
(sighs deeply) hey.

12:26.846 --> 12:28.847
Lilly, there is no easy way
to say this.

12:28.849 --> 12:31.382
You're having
a miscarriage.

12:38.491 --> 12:40.158
You're in a prison.

12:40.160 --> 12:42.293
You're single, so there are
no conjugal visits.

12:42.295 --> 12:44.796
You gotta help me out here,
lilly. How did you get pregnant?

12:44.798 --> 12:46.164
He's none of your business.

12:46.166 --> 12:47.465
I'm not asking for a name.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.000
'cause you won't get one.

12:49.002 --> 12:50.535
The only thing that I have left
is my word,

12:50.537 --> 12:52.070
And I ain't breaking it.

12:52.072 --> 12:53.805
Did you know
you were pregnant?

12:53.807 --> 12:55.306
Of course I didn't!

12:55.308 --> 12:58.309
Lilly, I can't help you if
I don't have a full picture.

12:58.311 --> 13:01.279
<i>Help</i> me?
You almost killed me!

13:01.281 --> 13:03.815
I get why you're upset.

13:03.817 --> 13:05.483
I do.

13:05.485 --> 13:08.353
But I am gonna need you to give
me access to your medical files.

13:08.355 --> 13:10.555
So you can help me,
like all the others helped me?

13:10.557 --> 13:12.123
No way.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.958
(door opens)

13:13.960 --> 13:16.161
Whoa, whoa. What--what--
what is all this?

13:16.163 --> 13:17.529
Her afternoon pills.

13:17.531 --> 13:19.464
That's half the pharmacy.

13:21.534 --> 13:23.535
Lilly...

13:23.537 --> 13:25.303
Can you tell me
what these are for?

13:25.305 --> 13:26.437
Did they explain it to you?

13:26.439 --> 13:28.039
Go to hell.

13:30.509 --> 13:32.243
(charlie) so, uh,
you finally retired?

13:32.245 --> 13:33.578
<i>Well, slowed down.</i>

13:33.580 --> 13:35.413
<i>I was gonna take</i>
<i>the mcdaniels chair</i>

13:35.415 --> 13:37.515
<i>In medical ethics</i>
<i>at the university.</i>

13:37.517 --> 13:39.083
That little massage parlor
incident

13:39.085 --> 13:40.518
Might've put a damper
on your moral authority.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.320
<i>Like you never?</i>

13:45.157 --> 13:47.025
(beep)
no, but I'm not judging.

13:47.027 --> 13:50.261
<i>Yeah, just taking perverse</i>
<i>pleasure in my misfortune.</i>

13:50.263 --> 13:52.130
No. (clears throat)

13:52.132 --> 13:54.966
Oh. That's, um...

13:54.968 --> 13:56.434
That's maggie's boyfriend.

13:56.436 --> 13:57.569
Yeah?
Okay.

13:57.571 --> 13:58.903
<i>Really?</i>
<i>Thanks.</i>

13:58.905 --> 14:00.138
He's a good guy.

14:00.140 --> 14:01.239
<i>Yeah, so he's</i>
<i>unlike me then.</i>

14:01.241 --> 14:02.440
He's a shrink.

14:02.442 --> 14:03.608
<i>Are you trying to hurt me?</i>

14:03.610 --> 14:06.077
Hey, gavin.
Uh, you got a sec?

14:06.079 --> 14:07.445
Yeah. What's up?

14:07.447 --> 14:09.881
Uh, this morning, um,
maggie was helping me do

14:09.883 --> 14:11.850
A-a harvest
on that bone donor.

14:11.852 --> 14:13.451
You know?
Yeah. Uh, why?

14:13.453 --> 14:14.619
Did something happen?

14:14.621 --> 14:16.354
What? No, she's fine.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.989
<i>Bit of a worrywart.</i>

14:17.991 --> 14:20.358
Uh, well, it turns out
that the donor

14:20.360 --> 14:22.560
Was--is... <i>Is,</i> uh...

14:22.562 --> 14:24.462
Maggie's dad.

14:24.464 --> 14:26.231
Mr. Lin?

14:26.233 --> 14:27.932
<i>Dr.</i> Lin?

14:27.934 --> 14:32.437
Yeah. The point is,
maggie doesn't actually know.

14:32.439 --> 14:34.205
Yeah.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.975
(clears throat) yeah, okay.
Yeah, I guess...

14:36.977 --> 14:39.310
If someone's gonna tell her, I
guess it should probably be me.

14:39.312 --> 14:41.412
I was kinda hoping
you'd say that.

14:41.414 --> 14:43.248
All right.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.249
Thank you.

14:44.251 --> 14:46.451
Yeah. Good luck with that.

14:49.388 --> 14:50.989
(sighs)

14:50.991 --> 14:53.491
Well, thanks for not mentioning
the blue lagoon.

14:53.493 --> 14:55.927
Oh, no, doc, that secret
dies with you--

14:55.929 --> 14:57.662
You and your masseuse.

14:57.664 --> 15:00.098
I hoped
you tipped her well.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.200
Tipped her... Uh...

15:02.202 --> 15:03.968
(p.A. Beeps)

15:03.970 --> 15:07.038
<i>(man speaking indistinctly</i>
<i>over p.A.)</i>

15:09.942 --> 15:12.944
(papers shuffling)

15:17.316 --> 15:18.449
Hey.

15:18.451 --> 15:20.151
Hey.

15:20.153 --> 15:22.654
Is it just me, or is
charlie harris getting nuttier?

15:22.656 --> 15:24.222
First he invites me to assist,

15:24.224 --> 15:25.523
And then we get to the morgue

15:25.525 --> 15:28.393
And he blows me off
with some lame excuse.

15:28.395 --> 15:30.662
Um...

15:30.664 --> 15:32.397
Mags, it's about your father.

15:32.399 --> 15:34.499
He didn't call you, did he?

15:34.501 --> 15:36.034
I've never met him.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.335
He keeps texting me
about dinner next week.

15:37.337 --> 15:38.636
I need to get back to him.

15:38.638 --> 15:41.039
Yeah, that's just
the thing. Um...

15:44.977 --> 15:46.945
He died last night.

15:49.481 --> 15:51.149
Was it a heart attack?

15:52.284 --> 15:54.252
Yeah.

15:54.254 --> 15:56.654
He's the body
in the morgue, isn't he?

15:58.490 --> 16:01.359
That's why charlie wouldn't...

16:08.701 --> 16:10.568
I need to call my mother.

16:19.278 --> 16:20.545
Hey.
Hey.

16:20.547 --> 16:23.214
Uh, how was, uh,
breaking bread with dana?

16:23.216 --> 16:25.149
She turned me down.

16:25.151 --> 16:26.451
Did you try plan "b,"

16:26.453 --> 16:27.452
The introduce-her-
to-the-patient approach?

16:27.454 --> 16:29.420
I did.
She still said no.

16:29.422 --> 16:30.521
Kind of cold.

16:30.523 --> 16:31.589
Yeah, she's changed, man.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.024
No, no, she hasn't changed.

16:33.026 --> 16:34.659
She wants to change,
but she can't.

16:34.661 --> 16:35.760
Do you want a plan "c"?

16:35.762 --> 16:36.995
Sure.

16:36.997 --> 16:38.363
Call her up, and let slip

16:38.365 --> 16:40.365
That you're gonna let dr. Storms
do the procedure.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.467
Mm, storms
has been suspended.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.769
No, just...
She doesn't know that.

16:44.771 --> 16:46.604
Try it.

16:46.606 --> 16:48.206
Just try it.

16:48.208 --> 16:50.742
'kay.

16:50.744 --> 16:53.111
One, two, three benzos.

16:53.113 --> 16:54.579
How much anxiety
could a girl have?

16:54.581 --> 16:56.647
See, these pills are more
to manage her behavior

16:56.649 --> 16:58.449
Than to treat any illness.

16:58.451 --> 17:00.084
Right, but the question is,
what's she got?

17:00.086 --> 17:02.253
And without her medical records,
we're in the dark.

17:02.255 --> 17:04.322
Nothing in the d.S.M.
Requires all these.

17:04.324 --> 17:06.457
Could the drugs themselves
be making her crazy?

17:06.459 --> 17:08.626
Given to someone who doesn't
need them, yeah. Absolutely.

17:08.628 --> 17:10.795
Okay, well, she's had
10 units of blood

17:10.797 --> 17:12.563
To help deal
with the hemorrhaging.

17:12.565 --> 17:14.799
Most of these drugs should have
washed out of her system.

17:14.801 --> 17:17.402
Most, yeah. But the pams are
metabolized through fat cells,

17:17.404 --> 17:19.470
So they take
a little longer to clear.

17:19.472 --> 17:20.772
What if you add a lipid drip?

17:20.774 --> 17:22.607
Uh, that speeds things up.
Okay.

17:22.609 --> 17:25.410
I want to withhold all drugs,

17:25.412 --> 17:28.079
See if we can get a glimpse
of the real lilly.

17:28.081 --> 17:31.516
Okay. Except for these ones.
They require a slow taper.

17:31.518 --> 17:34.419
All right. Thank you.

17:34.421 --> 17:37.622
(door closes)

17:37.624 --> 17:40.258
(dana) miss frank is gonna
call in a month.

17:40.260 --> 17:41.392
Enjoy.

17:41.394 --> 17:42.527
(woman) thank you.

17:42.529 --> 17:45.063
â™ª

17:45.065 --> 17:48.166
Dembele.

17:48.168 --> 17:51.769
Um...

17:51.771 --> 17:53.204
(clears throat) I understand
that you want to see me,

17:53.206 --> 17:56.474
But I... I'm afraid
I'm very busy.

17:56.476 --> 17:58.843
And so without an appointment,

17:58.845 --> 18:00.711
You're just gonna
have to wait.

18:00.713 --> 18:04.415
I've been waiting
11 months and 17 days, doctor.

18:04.417 --> 18:07.585
I can wait
a little longer.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.353
(machine beeps)

18:09.355 --> 18:12.423
(respirator hissing)

18:15.527 --> 18:18.362
(clicks)

18:18.364 --> 18:20.164
(door closes)

18:30.309 --> 18:33.644
I'm sorry
for what I said to you,

18:33.646 --> 18:35.413
And that I bit you.

18:36.482 --> 18:38.182
I know.

18:38.184 --> 18:42.353
And I'm--I'm not just saying
that to get out of these.

18:42.355 --> 18:44.288
You need to put me
back on my meds.

18:44.290 --> 18:45.756
I get rages.

18:45.758 --> 18:49.827
This wildness comes over me,
and I do things.

18:49.829 --> 18:52.897
Things you regret?

18:52.899 --> 18:55.399
Not everything.

18:55.401 --> 18:57.368
I don't regret percy.

18:57.370 --> 19:01.172
He was the only person who ever
had a kind word for me.

19:04.510 --> 19:07.445
We all need that.

19:07.447 --> 19:09.580
When did you meet percy?

19:09.582 --> 19:14.285
I met him at milton.
He's a librarian there.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.220
He would save
the women's mags for me

19:16.222 --> 19:17.822
So I could do
the quizzes first.

19:17.824 --> 19:20.391
So is he your boyfriend?

19:20.393 --> 19:24.395
(laughs) he tried to say no,
but I had my mind set on him.

19:24.397 --> 19:26.330
I am a leo after all.

19:33.605 --> 19:35.540
It would have been
a nice baby.

19:35.542 --> 19:39.443
Smart. You know?

19:41.747 --> 19:44.382
Lilly, I want to help you.

19:45.817 --> 19:49.620
But without your medical files,
my hands are tied.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.822
(exhales)

19:54.193 --> 19:57.628
Okay.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.397
But I'm trusting you.

20:01.366 --> 20:03.634
I know.

20:03.636 --> 20:07.438
(indistinct conversations,
equipment beeping)

20:07.440 --> 20:10.741
Dr. Reid. Good news.

20:10.743 --> 20:11.876
Really?

20:11.878 --> 20:13.277
Thanks to you.

20:13.279 --> 20:14.612
Me?

20:14.614 --> 20:16.547
Corrections is all over
my incident report.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.549
They're filing new charges
against lilly for the assault.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.885
Wait.

20:20.887 --> 20:23.621
There's no need
to pursue that. I'm fine.

20:23.623 --> 20:26.324
That's not for you or me
to decide.

20:26.326 --> 20:27.658
She's woken the beast now.

20:27.660 --> 20:29.460
The beast?
The system.

20:29.462 --> 20:30.861
Instead of another stay
in minimum,

20:30.863 --> 20:32.396
She's going to millburn.

20:32.398 --> 20:35.433
The s.H.U.--
Special handling unit.

20:35.435 --> 20:36.734
Maximum security.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.803
No. You can't do that.

20:38.805 --> 20:40.004
They will just
drug her out again.

20:40.006 --> 20:41.772
I'm trying to detox her
off those drugs

20:41.774 --> 20:43.274
So that we can find out
what's really wrong with her.

20:43.276 --> 20:44.508
There's nothing
wrong with her

20:44.510 --> 20:47.478
That maximum security
won't fix.

20:52.985 --> 20:54.652
Box of chocolates.

20:54.654 --> 20:55.920
That's how she gets
into the system.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.922
15 years old,
steals a box of chocolates

20:57.924 --> 21:00.391
To give to her mom
for valentine's day.

21:00.393 --> 21:01.892
Is she still in prison?

21:01.894 --> 21:03.961
Well, she got probation
for that and then...

21:03.963 --> 21:05.696
What?

21:05.698 --> 21:07.898
Assaulted her probation officer
with a school lunch box.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.900
Got juvie for that,
and then...

21:09.902 --> 21:11.902
Yeah, more assaults.
More assaults.

21:11.904 --> 21:17.308
Uh, "staff were attempting
to stop self-harming behaviors."

21:17.310 --> 21:18.509
Like cutting herself?

21:18.511 --> 21:20.811
Yeah.
Attempts at hanging--four.

21:20.813 --> 21:23.781
Slashed her wrist twice.
Head banging.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.049
God, she was in restraints

21:25.051 --> 21:26.484
Half the time
she's been in custody.

21:26.486 --> 21:27.985
So she tries to kill herself
six times,

21:27.987 --> 21:30.821
And she wasn't sectioned
for mental health? What gives?

21:30.823 --> 21:31.956
(mouths words)

21:31.958 --> 21:36.394
(siren wailing in distance)

21:36.396 --> 21:38.296
(pen scratching)

21:43.969 --> 21:47.071
(scoffs) you really are
a manipulative prick.

21:47.073 --> 21:49.373
And to what do I owe
the pleasure of this abuse?

21:49.375 --> 21:52.843
Sending dembele around to
my office when I told you "no."

21:52.845 --> 21:54.645
Well, he was a patient with
a condition that you could fix.

21:54.647 --> 21:55.813
That's all
that really matters.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.448
Really, joel?
Is that true?

21:57.450 --> 21:59.317
Because you seem to be going
to great lengths here,

21:59.319 --> 22:01.485
And I'm not sure why this guy
is so important to you.

22:01.487 --> 22:03.988
Well, maybe because
he was a slave, dana.

22:03.990 --> 22:06.724
A what?

22:06.726 --> 22:09.460
He was an actual slave
on a cocoa plantation.

22:09.462 --> 22:11.796
I mean, did you ever see
the marks on his wrists?

22:11.798 --> 22:14.565
Those are from shackles.

22:14.567 --> 22:16.033
The scar on his face,

22:16.035 --> 22:18.536
The reason that
his facial nerve was severed,

22:18.538 --> 22:21.038
That was from fighting off
a guard while escaping.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.574
I mean, do you know
what kept this guy going?

22:23.576 --> 22:25.009
What?

22:25.011 --> 22:27.411
Love kept this guy going.

22:27.413 --> 22:30.614
Dembele goes home,
he returns to mali, all right,

22:30.616 --> 22:33.884
Only to find
that the woman, his woman,

22:33.886 --> 22:36.053
Has been married off
by her family.

22:37.489 --> 22:41.359
This guy walked <i>across africa</i>
<i>just to reclaim her.</i>

22:41.361 --> 22:43.894
Hmm.

22:43.896 --> 22:45.730
Well, that's
a very romantic story.

22:45.732 --> 22:48.032
It's an incredibly romantic
story. I mean, the guy's a hero.

22:48.034 --> 22:49.734
He deserves much better.

22:49.736 --> 22:51.035
(pen cap clicks)

22:51.037 --> 22:52.903
I know.

22:52.905 --> 22:54.805
He told me the whole thing.

22:54.807 --> 22:57.508
I just wanted to hear you tell
me that story, and it was good.

22:57.510 --> 22:59.777
So do you remember anything from
your fellowship in microsurgery?

22:59.779 --> 23:01.512
Of course I do.

23:01.514 --> 23:03.047
Good, because I worked out
a plan,

23:03.049 --> 23:05.416
And it's gonna require two teams
working simultaneously.

23:05.418 --> 23:08.719
Hate what you've done
with the place, by the way.

23:08.721 --> 23:11.155
Okay.
So from the examination,

23:11.157 --> 23:12.690
It's clear
they should be able

23:12.692 --> 23:14.658
To harvest the sural nerve
from his leg.

23:14.660 --> 23:17.862
Mm-hmm?
They then coapt it
to this buccal branch,

23:17.864 --> 23:19.530
And the proximal end
is then passed

23:19.532 --> 23:20.765
Through to
the contralateral lip.

23:20.767 --> 23:22.533
They should be fine.
You're saying "they."

23:22.535 --> 23:24.034
By that you mean
you and me, right?

23:24.036 --> 23:26.036
There's a complete
decision tree here.

23:26.038 --> 23:27.838
I'm sure they're gonna
be able to find it. There's--
no. No. No.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.640
Dana, there is
no "they" in this.

23:29.642 --> 23:31.041
If you don't do this now,

23:31.043 --> 23:33.544
His facial musculature
will be irreversibly atrophic.

23:33.546 --> 23:36.113
You still have time
to assemble a team. Good luck.

23:36.115 --> 23:38.883
Dana.
It's been almost a year.

23:38.885 --> 23:40.151
What are you talk--look,

23:40.153 --> 23:42.420
You wrote a damn paper
on this thing.

23:42.422 --> 23:43.954
Look, if we don't do this,

23:43.956 --> 23:46.490
The muscle dies
and the paralysis is permanent.

23:46.492 --> 23:48.459
Need to do this now.
Joel.

23:48.461 --> 23:51.495
I just... I can't
come back here.

23:53.165 --> 23:54.865
I'm sorry.
Okay.

23:54.867 --> 23:57.868
It's fine. We'll just let
dr. Storms take care of it.

23:59.704 --> 24:00.971
Storms?

24:00.973 --> 24:03.007
He seems like
a competent plastics guy.

24:03.009 --> 24:05.910
After all poor dembele
has been through,

24:05.912 --> 24:09.146
You're gonna let that idiot
storms ruin the poor man's face?

24:09.148 --> 24:13.451
Well, it's not really
my decision, is it, dana?

24:16.721 --> 24:18.155
(exhales)

24:18.157 --> 24:23.627
(machine beeping)

24:23.629 --> 24:24.895
Look at you.

24:24.897 --> 24:27.164
Your color's back.
Vitals are stable.

24:27.166 --> 24:28.866
These are all good signs.

24:28.868 --> 24:31.869
They're taking me
to the s.H.U.

24:31.871 --> 24:35.673
You have to be crazy
to survive in there.

24:35.675 --> 24:38.809
I need those meds. You have to
give those meds back to me.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.478
I need...
(machines beeping rapidly)

24:40.480 --> 24:41.745
(gasps, wheezing)

24:41.747 --> 24:43.981
Jackson, 2 milligrams
of lorazepam I.V.,

24:43.983 --> 24:46.484
And call shahir. Okay,
can I get some help here?
Need help in here!

24:46.486 --> 24:49.587
I'm gonna be
turning you over, all right?

24:49.589 --> 24:51.121
Don't try to help me.
Just relax.

24:51.123 --> 24:54.024
And... Go.
There we go.

24:54.026 --> 24:55.693
We're here. Everything
is gonna be okay.

24:55.695 --> 24:57.094
We're gonna ride this out
together.

24:57.096 --> 24:59.630
It's gonna be over soon.
Okay?

24:59.632 --> 25:02.900
Breathe in. Breathe out.

25:02.902 --> 25:05.636
And we're here with you.

25:05.638 --> 25:08.072
How long has she been seizing?

25:08.074 --> 25:09.607
Just started.
(lilly grunting)

25:10.642 --> 25:12.943
(gulps, breathing deeply)

25:12.945 --> 25:15.880
It's over. It's gonna be okay.

25:15.882 --> 25:17.081
Let's turn her over.

25:28.260 --> 25:29.994
Alex. You see this?

25:29.996 --> 25:31.295
What?

25:36.134 --> 25:37.835
(alex) those rings?

25:37.837 --> 25:40.070
I didn't see those till now.

25:40.072 --> 25:42.773
They're called
kayser-fleischer rings.

25:42.775 --> 25:45.142
I think your patient
has wilson's disease.

25:45.144 --> 25:47.111
So you're telling me
all of her bizarre behaviors

25:47.113 --> 25:48.279
Have an organic basis?

25:48.281 --> 25:50.114
If it's wilson's, yes.

25:50.116 --> 25:53.183
(indistinct conversations)

26:08.967 --> 26:12.303
Hey.

26:12.305 --> 26:16.240
(exhales)

26:16.242 --> 26:21.045
My father was
a man on a mission.

26:21.047 --> 26:23.781
Must have been intimidating
living in his shadow.

26:23.783 --> 26:26.784
I would have loved that.

26:26.786 --> 26:28.919
But he was never around.

26:28.921 --> 26:30.087
Right.

26:30.089 --> 26:33.023
World health organization's
in geneva.

26:33.025 --> 26:36.060
Took the job
without even asking mom.

26:36.062 --> 26:38.662
Was that why they divorced?

26:38.664 --> 26:42.600
Abandoned his family
to help other people.

26:42.602 --> 26:44.234
Who does that?

26:47.806 --> 26:49.273
I've only ever seen
the one case of wilson's,

26:49.275 --> 26:51.342
Back when I was doing
my residency in new york.

26:51.344 --> 26:52.843
It's textbook rare,
isn't it?

26:52.845 --> 26:55.079
Yeah, this girl was...
What are you, 19?

26:55.081 --> 26:56.246
21.

26:56.248 --> 26:57.881
No, she was much younger.

26:57.883 --> 26:59.149
Usually kayser-fleischer rings

26:59.151 --> 27:00.884
Don't show up
until the late teens.

27:00.886 --> 27:02.953
Guys.
'sup?

27:02.955 --> 27:04.355
We'll be right back,
okay?

27:09.995 --> 27:11.662
Okay. So what causes them?

27:11.664 --> 27:13.097
Copper deposits.

27:13.099 --> 27:15.232
Right. People with wilson's
can't process copper.

27:15.234 --> 27:16.767
That's right. It builds up
in the body.

27:16.769 --> 27:18.235
They started as crescents,

27:18.237 --> 27:19.903
And then over time,
they--they become full circles.

27:19.905 --> 27:21.705
Look at these symptoms.
Hmm?

27:21.707 --> 27:24.842
Prone to miscarriages, rages,
sexually aggressive manor.

27:24.844 --> 27:26.143
Mm-hmm. That's the copper.

27:26.145 --> 27:28.012
It acts on the basal ganglia.

27:28.014 --> 27:29.413
And effects decision making,
right?

27:29.415 --> 27:31.749
Yes. Definitely yes.

27:31.751 --> 27:33.050
So if she had been
properly diagnosed

27:33.052 --> 27:34.385
And prescribed
the right medications,

27:34.387 --> 27:35.919
She never would have
gotten into trouble?

27:35.921 --> 27:37.287
Uh, probably not.

27:37.289 --> 27:38.856
It's a progressive disease,
isn't it?

27:38.858 --> 27:40.691
She's only gonna
get worse over time?

27:40.693 --> 27:42.059
All the more reason

27:42.061 --> 27:43.327
That she shouldn't spend
her life behind bars.

27:43.329 --> 27:44.862
Are you certain
that it's wilson's?

27:44.864 --> 27:46.764
Her symptoms are indicative,
not conclusive.

27:46.766 --> 27:49.033
The best way to find out
is d.N.A. Testing.

27:49.035 --> 27:50.668
That'll take weeks.

27:50.670 --> 27:52.002
Well, then a liver biopsy.

27:52.004 --> 27:54.805
Can't risk it.
She's lost too much blood.

27:54.807 --> 27:56.740
Surely there's some way
that's less invasive?

27:56.742 --> 28:01.111
Um... Well, there may be
another method.

28:11.923 --> 28:14.158
(dana) all right, I'll take
the tumescence now.

28:14.160 --> 28:17.995
(dr. Baumann)
15 ccs of epinephrine,

28:17.997 --> 28:19.697
Come on down.

28:26.071 --> 28:28.105
(machine beeps)

28:28.107 --> 28:29.973
Number 15.

28:41.786 --> 28:43.954
I'll take protractors
and my face-lift scissors.

28:47.459 --> 28:49.026
Are you really gonna do it
that way?

28:49.028 --> 28:51.261
Well, it branches less
from bottom to top

28:51.263 --> 28:53.197
Than it does
from top to bottom.

28:53.199 --> 28:55.399
Remind me never to take you
to a knife fight.

28:55.401 --> 28:57.434
Nerve stripper.

29:04.943 --> 29:07.811
(dana) looks like I'm gonna need
about 12 centimeters up here.

29:07.813 --> 29:10.481
Forceps and loop.

29:10.483 --> 29:15.352
If I were any further up inside
this guy, he'd be a sock puppet.

29:15.354 --> 29:17.087
All right. Hand me
the nerve-stim.

29:19.023 --> 29:20.357
(woman) here you go.

29:20.359 --> 29:21.492
(dana) you might want to
pay attention here,

29:21.494 --> 29:23.227
Because if this nerve is dead,

29:23.229 --> 29:26.363
We're gonna have to
close him up and go home.

29:26.365 --> 29:27.498
Ready?

29:27.500 --> 29:29.266
Mm-hmm.

29:38.910 --> 29:40.511
(scoffs)

29:40.513 --> 29:43.080
Don't worry about it.
I think third time's the charm.

29:43.082 --> 29:44.815
(dana) I knew it.
(joel) what?

29:44.817 --> 29:48.819
Underneath that cynical veneer,
you're a romantic.

29:48.821 --> 29:49.987
(laughs)

29:49.989 --> 29:51.421
Okay. Last chance.
Here we go.

29:52.891 --> 29:55.926
(machine beeping)

29:55.928 --> 29:57.261
Oh! Amazing.
Yeah!

29:57.263 --> 30:00.364
Man, that's what
I wanted to see. Okay.

30:00.366 --> 30:01.865
That one has pure function.

30:01.867 --> 30:02.900
Looks like we're
in business here.

30:02.902 --> 30:05.135
This might actually work.

30:05.137 --> 30:06.537
How you doing down there?

30:06.539 --> 30:09.139
(joel) severing the nerve
right now.

30:09.141 --> 30:11.108
(dana) I'm gonna prep
the other side.

30:15.280 --> 30:17.347
(machine beeps)

30:24.389 --> 30:27.991
(joel) and behold.

30:27.993 --> 30:30.093
The white worm.
(dana) very nice.

30:30.095 --> 30:32.062
4.0 to close, please.

30:39.537 --> 30:42.940
Charlie.
Oh.

30:42.942 --> 30:46.009
I want to help.

30:46.011 --> 30:48.512
That's not gonna happen,
maggie.

30:48.514 --> 30:51.582
My father was a doctor.
I'm a doctor.

30:51.584 --> 30:53.917
We're trained to be
dispassionate, objective.

30:53.919 --> 30:55.319
Uh, not when it comes
to family.

30:55.321 --> 30:57.020
That's why we don't treat 'em,
prescribe to 'em,

30:57.022 --> 30:58.322
Or operate on 'em.

30:58.324 --> 31:02.259
I get that.
But... This is different.

31:02.261 --> 31:03.861
This is one thing
that I could do for him

31:03.863 --> 31:06.330
That would really
mean something.

31:08.266 --> 31:11.401
I'm not comfortable
with this maggie. I'm sorry.

31:13.204 --> 31:15.138
I can't cry for him.

31:19.978 --> 31:22.045
He's why I became a doctor.

31:23.214 --> 31:26.450
He'd want me to do this
for him.

31:34.559 --> 31:35.893
I don't know.

31:35.895 --> 31:37.661
Come on, charlie.

31:37.663 --> 31:40.664
He could've died in a dozen
hospitals in this town,

31:40.666 --> 31:43.233
But he didn't.
That has to mean something.

31:43.235 --> 31:46.203
Let me do this.

31:55.246 --> 31:56.914
(exhales deeply)

32:07.492 --> 32:10.427
<i>That's my girl.</i>

32:16.534 --> 32:18.035
You okay?

32:18.037 --> 32:20.537
Yeah.

32:20.539 --> 32:22.673
I'm my father's daughter.

32:30.315 --> 32:33.150
You wanna use the 8-0.

32:33.152 --> 32:34.584
Yes, ma'am.

32:34.586 --> 32:37.387
And don't be a guy, all right?
More is not better.

32:37.389 --> 32:39.222
Two stitches is all I want.

32:39.224 --> 32:40.424
Just tack it together.

32:40.426 --> 32:43.160
That is all
you are gonna get.

32:43.162 --> 32:44.494
'cause it's kind of like
gardening, right?

32:44.496 --> 32:46.430
You wanna keep it
nice and loose and casual,

32:46.432 --> 32:49.967
And then the nerves sprout
all sorts of pretty axons.

32:49.969 --> 32:51.969
God, I love it when
you talk dirty to me.

32:51.971 --> 32:54.705
(chuckles) steady.

32:54.707 --> 32:56.373
(taps keyboard)

32:56.375 --> 32:59.142
And here...
(taps keyboard)

32:59.144 --> 33:01.645
Is the image I just took
of lilly's brain.

33:01.647 --> 33:03.313
It's the same.

33:03.315 --> 33:05.282
Mm-hmm.
What's that structure there?

33:05.284 --> 33:06.650
Hmm.

33:06.652 --> 33:08.685
You'll note
the symmetric bilateral areas

33:08.687 --> 33:11.521
Of t2 hyperintensity involving
subcortical white matter,

33:11.523 --> 33:13.757
Basal ganglia,
external capsules,

33:13.759 --> 33:15.325
Thalami, midbrain,
and pons.

33:15.327 --> 33:18.362
Note it, yes.
Understand it? Not so much.

33:18.364 --> 33:20.731
Well, the disease progressively
involves more and more

33:20.733 --> 33:22.065
Of the midbrain.

33:22.067 --> 33:23.467
So this happens
over many years?

33:23.469 --> 33:25.035
Yes.

33:25.037 --> 33:27.037
And these are
the copper deposits right there?

33:27.039 --> 33:30.040
Definitely. You know, it took me
a while to recall the paper

33:30.042 --> 33:32.676
That imaged a distinctive
feature of wilson's.

33:32.678 --> 33:34.611
They call it
the face of the giant panda.

33:34.613 --> 33:35.746
See the eyes?

33:35.748 --> 33:38.715
(gavin) eyes, <i>and...</i>

33:38.717 --> 33:40.217
Maybe a snout.

33:40.219 --> 33:41.585
These dots. Mm-hmm.

33:41.587 --> 33:43.687
They're formed in
the central tagmental tract.

33:43.689 --> 33:45.155
Okay.

33:45.157 --> 33:47.391
So... Lilly has
wilson's, then?

33:47.393 --> 33:49.126
Mm-hmm.

33:54.532 --> 33:56.566
So you do know there was
never any chance

33:56.568 --> 34:00.237
Of storms operating on that
surgery today, don't you?

34:00.239 --> 34:01.671
No, I didn't,
but I just heard

34:01.673 --> 34:03.106
He'd been suspended
by the board.

34:03.108 --> 34:05.409
That was <i>low.</i>
<i>You impressed?</i>

34:05.411 --> 34:08.278
It's something charlie harris
would pull, so yes.

34:08.280 --> 34:11.281
We were good in there today,
dana.

34:11.283 --> 34:13.283
A good team.
Mm-hmm.

34:13.285 --> 34:15.385
So, you know,
with storms gone,

34:15.387 --> 34:17.254
Your old job's open again.

34:17.256 --> 34:19.322
It's yours if you want it,
and I know you want it.

34:19.324 --> 34:21.158
Oh, do you?
Mm-hmm.

34:21.160 --> 34:23.060
What I saw you do today
with dembele,

34:23.062 --> 34:24.227
I mean, that was...

34:24.229 --> 34:25.695
(inhales deeply)

34:25.697 --> 34:28.765
You changed a man's life.

34:28.767 --> 34:30.233
I mean, it's gotta be
a little bit more gratifying

34:30.235 --> 34:32.102
Than vacuuming fat
out of an ass, right?

34:37.542 --> 34:41.578
I don't--you know the thing
about my old job here?

34:41.580 --> 34:43.246
I've done it.

34:46.684 --> 34:48.351
I've moved on.

34:48.353 --> 34:49.553
Okay.

34:49.555 --> 34:52.522
What if
you could do

34:52.524 --> 34:54.091
The kind of meaningful surgery
that we did today, every day?

34:54.093 --> 34:55.592
Think about that.
(clicks tongue)

34:56.661 --> 34:57.861
Okay.

35:01.165 --> 35:03.200
You know, when you called me
the other day for lunch,

35:03.202 --> 35:05.135
I thought...

35:05.137 --> 35:06.470
You thought what?

35:06.472 --> 35:09.172
(siren wailing in distance)

35:09.174 --> 35:10.507
Nothing.

35:14.745 --> 35:17.481
So I'll start you on a drug
called tetrathiomolybdate.

35:17.483 --> 35:20.684
It'll stop your body
from absorbing any more copper.

35:20.686 --> 35:23.820
And then we'll work on a diet
program from here on out.

35:23.822 --> 35:25.522
Officer hazard.

35:25.524 --> 35:27.357
I was just going over
lilly's treatment.

35:27.359 --> 35:28.825
Her "treatment" is prison.

35:28.827 --> 35:30.494
Now that we know what
she's suffering from,

35:30.496 --> 35:31.828
Her condition can be managed.

35:31.830 --> 35:33.563
You're not gonna see
the same behavioral problems

35:33.565 --> 35:35.832
Because we're gonna--
because she'll be locked
in a box.

35:35.834 --> 35:37.367
That is not fair.

35:37.369 --> 35:39.636
You can't go ahead
with this transfer.

35:39.638 --> 35:42.305
Is she stable enough to travel?

35:42.307 --> 35:43.673
Yes.

35:43.675 --> 35:45.509
But I don't think that it--
get her ready.

35:45.511 --> 35:48.812
I'm ordering an ambulance. We'll
leave as soon as it gets here.

35:53.818 --> 35:56.553
You say that prison isn't
the place for me,

35:56.555 --> 35:58.155
That I'm sick.

35:58.157 --> 36:00.323
But I still have to go?
How is that right?

36:00.325 --> 36:02.159
Lilly, I am not gonna let that
happen to you.

36:02.161 --> 36:06.196
Please, don't get my hopes up.
You can't win with these people.

36:11.235 --> 36:12.702
You just had to keep picking
at me like some scab,

36:12.704 --> 36:14.471
Like some mystery to be solved.

36:14.473 --> 36:16.740
That's what we do here.
We find out what's wrong.

36:16.742 --> 36:18.608
But what's the point
if you can't fix it?

36:18.610 --> 36:20.410
We can treat it
and we can manage it,

36:20.412 --> 36:23.280
But none of that is gonna happen
if you go to prison tonight.

36:23.282 --> 36:26.383
Hey! What the hell
is going on here?!

36:26.385 --> 36:28.218
We're transferring her
to the psych ward.

36:28.220 --> 36:30.687
You're not taking her anywhere.
She's my prisoner.

36:30.689 --> 36:32.255
I'm afraid not.

36:32.257 --> 36:33.723
I've invoked my authority
as her primary caregiver

36:33.725 --> 36:36.459
To section her under form one
of the mental health act.

36:36.461 --> 36:38.328
This is b.S.
You can't do that.

36:38.330 --> 36:39.829
Yeah, actually, she can.

36:39.831 --> 36:41.264
Lilly's gonna be held
for assessment

36:41.266 --> 36:43.433
On our closed psych ward
for 72 hours.

36:43.435 --> 36:44.968
Longer if necessary.

36:44.970 --> 36:46.836
Why the hell
are you doing this?

36:46.838 --> 36:49.839
She is a crazed felon.
She belongs in prison.

36:49.841 --> 36:51.474
Are you kidding me.

36:54.245 --> 36:57.514
So if you'll just sign
this transfer of custody...

37:06.791 --> 37:07.924
This isn't over.

37:07.926 --> 37:10.660
You wanna hang around?
Book a hotel room.

37:19.403 --> 37:20.837
(alex) I have called a lawyer
I know,

37:20.839 --> 37:22.772
And he's gonna come in tomorrow,
consult with you.

37:22.774 --> 37:25.742
He thinks that he can get
the authorities to back down

37:25.744 --> 37:27.477
And let you serve out
the rest of your sentence

37:27.479 --> 37:28.812
In minimum security.

37:28.814 --> 37:30.614
Why are you doing all this?

37:30.616 --> 37:33.617
First rule of medicine--
"do no harm."

37:33.619 --> 37:35.252
â™ª

37:35.254 --> 37:37.787
And...

37:37.789 --> 37:39.356
I brought you this.

37:39.358 --> 37:40.824
Apparently, there's
a really good quiz in the back.

37:40.826 --> 37:44.261
(christopher smith's
"bitch and moan broken english")

37:44.263 --> 37:46.630
You wanna hear
your horoscope?

37:46.632 --> 37:47.764
Okay.

37:47.766 --> 37:49.366
â™ª when I'm asleep

37:49.368 --> 37:51.701
Okay.

37:53.404 --> 37:56.773
â™ª I guess that it's true

37:56.775 --> 38:00.343
â™ª the heart beats then, too

38:00.345 --> 38:03.913
â™ª much more brightly there

38:06.717 --> 38:10.453
â™ª because it lights in my room

38:10.455 --> 38:11.655
(clipboard clatters)

38:14.759 --> 38:18.695
â™ª and keeps me from sleeping

38:21.532 --> 38:24.868
â™ª the whole night through

38:24.870 --> 38:27.937
(crying)

38:30.741 --> 38:34.411
â™ª I can't

38:34.413 --> 38:36.079
â™ª get it

38:36.081 --> 38:41.384
â™ª out of my head

38:45.523 --> 38:48.658
â™ª I can't

38:48.660 --> 38:50.760
â™ª get it

38:50.762 --> 38:55.565
â™ª out of my head

38:59.704 --> 39:02.605
â™ª when I held

39:02.607 --> 39:04.541
â™ª

39:07.011 --> 39:10.580
â™ª how the hell am I

39:10.582 --> 39:13.550
â™ª ever going to get

39:13.552 --> 39:15.418
â™ª over this?

39:15.420 --> 39:16.886
â™ª

39:19.990 --> 39:23.059
(child crying in distance)

39:26.097 --> 39:30.834
So now I hear you're advocating
for this girl who bit you.

39:30.836 --> 39:32.402
I-I guess I'm just trying
to make up

39:32.404 --> 39:34.537
For everyone
who let her down, that's all.

39:34.539 --> 39:36.873
Mm-hmm. Do you want
the good news or the bad news?

39:36.875 --> 39:39.042
I could use some good.

39:39.044 --> 39:41.144
Okay.
Well, the good news is, um,

39:41.146 --> 39:44.381
Your prisoner patient has
neither hep-c not h.I.V.

39:44.383 --> 39:46.082
That's good. And the bad?

39:46.084 --> 39:48.685
Uh, the bad news is she could
still be a teenage werewolf.

39:48.687 --> 39:49.853
(sighs deeply)
it's quite popular these days.

39:49.855 --> 39:51.588
And a tad overdone,
do you think?

39:51.590 --> 39:54.791
(chuckles)
so is the vampire thing.
I'm sick of that.

39:54.793 --> 39:56.760
Yeah. Uh, charlie...

39:56.762 --> 39:59.496
There's this thing
I gotta go do.

39:59.498 --> 40:02.966
Hmm. Something to do with
that phone call you got?

40:02.968 --> 40:04.734
You don't miss much,
do you, doctor?

40:04.736 --> 40:07.404
Not much. Just you.

40:08.672 --> 40:10.907
Come home soon.

40:10.909 --> 40:12.575
I will.

40:25.523 --> 40:27.557
This is the last time.
(whispers) ohh.

40:27.559 --> 40:29.526
(normal voice) I like
your positivity.

40:29.528 --> 40:31.194
This is not funny, luke.

40:31.196 --> 40:33.496
I was starting to think you were
gonna bail on me, girlie.

40:33.498 --> 40:35.899
Hey, you know what? I haven't
been "girlie" since dad died.

40:35.901 --> 40:37.100
Okay.

40:37.102 --> 40:38.201
Hey, look at this thing.
Can I drive?

40:38.203 --> 40:39.936
Are you kidding me?

40:39.938 --> 40:41.571
After what you did to the front
window of that pie shop?

40:41.573 --> 40:42.705
I don't think so.

40:42.707 --> 40:43.706
Come on.

40:43.708 --> 40:45.475
Licorice.
Hey!

40:49.580 --> 40:52.115
â™ª

40:52.117 --> 40:53.917
Don't you even wanna know
what happened?

40:53.919 --> 40:55.685
I'm sure it wasn't your fault.
It wasn't.

40:55.687 --> 40:57.220
â™ª

40:57.222 --> 40:58.822
Yeah, of course,
because it's never your fault.

40:58.824 --> 41:01.458
You're perfect.
It's everybody else's fault.

41:01.460 --> 41:02.892
Okay, we're doing that.

41:02.894 --> 41:06.963
What home?
The wonderful st. Catherine's.

41:06.965 --> 41:08.698
I'll stay with mom a while.

41:08.700 --> 41:10.200
Unh-unh. Here.

41:10.202 --> 41:11.534
â™ª

41:11.536 --> 41:13.570
Dig around for my wallet.

41:13.572 --> 41:15.505
You can take it.
There's about 100 bucks.

41:15.507 --> 41:17.240
It's all yours.
Alex, I can't.

41:17.242 --> 41:18.808
Yeah, you can.

41:18.810 --> 41:22.912
Well, I'd rather you take it
from me than ask mom.

41:22.914 --> 41:24.814
I'm gonna pay you back.

41:24.816 --> 41:25.949
Yeah. Luke, I'd really like
to believe you.

41:25.951 --> 41:27.217
But I'm not gonna hold
my breath.

41:27.219 --> 41:28.751
You're gonna get it back,
with interest.

41:28.753 --> 41:29.953
(sighs)

41:29.955 --> 41:31.621
All right?

41:31.623 --> 41:33.656
You know I'm not talking about
the money, right?

41:33.658 --> 41:34.991
Girlie, I make mistakes.

41:34.993 --> 41:36.526
It's who I am.

41:36.528 --> 41:37.694
Yeah, and you're good
at it.

41:37.696 --> 41:40.663
What is that?
What--you see w--

41:40.665 --> 41:41.965
That's what I'm talking about.

41:41.967 --> 41:43.132
You don't actually think
that I can change.

41:43.134 --> 41:44.868
No. So now this is
<i>my</i> fault?

41:44.870 --> 41:46.503
No, it's not your fault.

41:46.505 --> 41:49.706
But you can cut me
some slack.

41:49.708 --> 41:52.575
I'm trying.

41:52.577 --> 41:55.144
Okay.

41:55.146 --> 41:56.980
I'm sure you're hungry.

41:56.982 --> 41:58.715
I could eat.

41:58.717 --> 42:00.683
All right. Well, keep your eyes
peeled. It's on you.

42:00.685 --> 42:02.285
â™ª

42:02.287 --> 42:04.654
Actually, it's on <i>you.</i>

42:04.656 --> 42:06.890
(laughs)

42:06.892 --> 42:12.228
