but you were invited.

38:03.582 --> 38:05.065
- I wanted to be there,
but I wanted to show up

38:05.100 --> 38:06.383
to something that
wasn't low budget,

38:06.418 --> 38:07.884
is what I wanted.
- Oh, lord!

38:07.919 --> 38:09.119
- Your mama is low budget.
Watch your mouth.

38:09.154 --> 38:10.420
- Oh!
- Ooh.

38:10.455 --> 38:11.288
- Watch your mouth.
- Okay.

38:11.323 --> 38:12.322
♪♪

38:12.357 --> 38:14.574
- whoa, okay, candiace,
that's team too much,

38:14.609 --> 38:16.392
and I'm not quite sure
if you know about

38:16.411 --> 38:18.895
mia's mother
and her back story.

38:18.914 --> 38:21.865
- I, um, was in
the foster care system.

38:21.900 --> 38:22.899
- Oh.

38:22.918 --> 38:25.368
- My mom and I have not
started having a good

38:25.403 --> 38:28.121
relationship until
as of recently.

38:28.173 --> 38:30.874
- Talk about mia's
feet and her hands

38:30.909 --> 38:32.876
'cause they're very large,
not her mama.

38:32.911 --> 38:35.645
That's below the belt.

38:35.681 --> 38:36.780
- How dare you invite me to
come here with no management?

38:36.815 --> 38:39.549
- I'm done, I'm done, I'm done.
I'm done listening.

38:39.584 --> 38:41.384
- And not even have
the audacity to say thank you

38:41.420 --> 38:42.635
for spending the time to
come and support me?

38:42.688 --> 38:45.438
- Listen, listen,
I'm done.

38:45.474 --> 38:48.425
Supporting me is not asking
my mama about my money.

38:48.460 --> 38:49.809
- You talked about it to
the group, so I don't think

38:49.861 --> 38:51.795
you should be that upset.
- Were you there, beloved?

38:51.830 --> 38:54.147
Were you there?
- No, but like I said--

38:54.199 --> 38:55.131
- end of story.
Good night.

38:55.167 --> 38:56.816
- If I had wasted my time,
I would have been

38:56.868 --> 38:57.801
a pissed sister.
Believe you me.

38:57.836 --> 38:59.569
- Wasted your time?
Yeah, you are-- you're--

38:59.604 --> 39:00.704
you're a pissy sister,
is what you are.

39:00.739 --> 39:02.405
- No, honey, I'm very happy.
- She's not really pissy.

39:02.440 --> 39:03.573
- No, honey,
I'm very happy.

39:03.608 --> 39:04.574
I don't fake--
I don't fake it.

39:04.609 --> 39:07.377
- Shut your wide face ass up.
- Oh, no, no!

39:07.412 --> 39:08.661
- Robyn and
gizelle, take notes.

39:08.714 --> 39:11.481
This is a shady moment.
- We're well aware.

39:11.516 --> 39:14.834
- Yep, I had it right here.
- We're well aware.

39:14.886 --> 39:18.171
- Next question, who
else had things to say?

39:18.223 --> 39:19.172
- Karen was talking
to your mama.

39:19.224 --> 39:21.458
- But-- but why are you
saying karen's name

39:21.493 --> 39:22.675
before you say
your name?

39:22.728 --> 39:24.477
- So, you were all asking if
my husband was on the payroll.

39:24.513 --> 39:26.646
- No, not this chick--
not this chick.

39:26.681 --> 39:28.431
- But we did say, well,
what was the answer?

39:28.466 --> 39:29.666
Yes, we was being shady.

39:29.701 --> 39:30.600
- When I came over to gizelle
and robyn, and they said,

39:30.635 --> 39:32.769
"well, what's wrong
with that question?"

39:32.804 --> 39:33.903
that was it.

39:33.939 --> 39:36.072
- For me, I don't think
there's anything wrong with

39:36.108 --> 39:38.375
that question because I have
been on juan's payroll.

39:38.410 --> 39:40.693
If you pay chris a salary,
there's nothing

39:40.746 --> 39:41.778
wrong with that.
- Yeah.

39:41.813 --> 39:43.363
No, there isn't,
but I'm not. Yes.

39:43.415 --> 39:44.480
- Okay, like,
and that's fine.

39:44.499 --> 39:47.617
So, I think some people get
a little more finicky

39:47.652 --> 39:49.202
when it comes to talking about
money and stuff like that.

39:49.254 --> 39:50.203
- I-- I'm that person.

39:50.255 --> 39:51.554
I don't like talking
about money at all.

39:51.590 --> 39:52.822
- Right. So, maybe
you are. Okay.

39:52.841 --> 39:54.007
- And I especially don't like
when people I don't really

39:54.042 --> 39:55.158
know are asking people that
they don't really know about

39:55.177 --> 39:59.429
money in my house, and I don't
appreciate you all being

39:59.464 --> 40:01.014
shady talkin' to my mama.
- Iwasn't being shady.

40:01.049 --> 40:02.232
I was asking.

40:02.267 --> 40:03.883
- You're calling
my sh-- low budget.

40:06.104 --> 40:08.037
- I have been a friend
to your ass, okay?

40:08.073 --> 40:09.055
- Mm-hmm.

40:09.107 --> 40:10.723
- When these ho's was
talkin' sh-- about you,

40:10.776 --> 40:11.975
I was defending
your ass.

40:12.010 --> 40:12.809
- These ho's?
I am certainly not a ho.

40:12.844 --> 40:15.395
- So, how dare you
call my sh-- low?

40:15.447 --> 40:16.312
You should not have come.

40:16.348 --> 40:18.898
And for future reference,
just don't come.

40:22.053 --> 40:22.869
That's the end of that.

40:22.904 --> 40:23.987
- That's fine.
- We're gonna move on.

40:24.022 --> 40:26.739
We have a couple more, um,
questions for the game.

40:26.792 --> 40:28.741
So, candiace, I'm gonna read
something, and you hold up

40:28.794 --> 40:30.743
whether or not it's reasonable
or whether or not it's shady.

40:30.796 --> 40:32.595
M'kay, this is
a good one.

40:32.631 --> 40:36.166
Is it reasonable, or is it
shady to call your friend when

40:36.201 --> 40:40.270
you're drunk to tell them how
much you don't like them?

40:40.305 --> 40:41.554
[laughing]

40:41.590 --> 40:42.639
- I think
it's reasonable.

40:42.674 --> 40:43.706
- I think that's
reasonable, too.

40:43.725 --> 40:44.441
- I think it's reasonable.

40:44.476 --> 40:45.642
- I think it's
very reasonable.

40:45.677 --> 40:46.443
- Everybody point to karen.
- You have to let them know.

40:46.478 --> 40:48.812
- I own it.
It's karen's juice.

40:48.847 --> 40:50.814
- Just don't call.
- Reasonably shady.

40:50.849 --> 40:52.565
- Robyn, on a serious note,
you have just as much fun.

40:52.601 --> 40:53.750
Let me
tell you something.

40:53.785 --> 40:56.019
I was throwing a par-tay
and gettin' down, and I was

40:56.054 --> 40:56.886
like, "I'm gonna be
real wit' you, robyn.

40:56.922 --> 40:59.956
I really don't like you,"
and I said--

40:59.991 --> 41:01.991
- yeah, this-- this is
a true story, askale.

41:02.027 --> 41:05.462
- I said, "I like juan
better than I like you."

41:05.497 --> 41:07.797
I'm reasonable.
[laughing]

41:07.833 --> 41:10.416
- I absolutely love
when karen drunk dials

41:10.452 --> 41:11.935
in the middle of
the afternoon.

41:11.970 --> 41:13.586
It is the best.

41:13.622 --> 41:15.622
- For me, it's like
I can't hang up.

41:15.674 --> 41:17.173
Her drunk calls are actually
the only time that

41:17.209 --> 41:18.291
she's actually
being honest.

41:18.343 --> 41:20.743
- I'm actually loving
vaccinated karen

41:20.762 --> 41:23.146
'cause I'm thinking it's
like drunk karen 2.0.

41:23.181 --> 41:24.747
This is
the girl we love.

41:24.766 --> 41:26.716
Um, okay, this might
be our last one.

41:26.751 --> 41:27.917
- Oh, yeah.
- Last question.

41:27.936 --> 41:29.585
- 'cause my-- my foot is
startin' to-- to palpitate.

41:29.604 --> 41:30.436
- Last question.

41:30.472 --> 41:31.804
- I'm gonna let robyn
do the last one.

41:31.857 --> 41:32.889
- Lord.

41:32.924 --> 41:34.157
- Because, you know, this
is a group effort here.

41:34.192 --> 41:36.926
[laughing]

41:36.962 --> 41:42.148
- is it reasonable, or is it
shady to be concerned

41:42.200 --> 41:45.985
about dramatic changes to
your friend's appearance

41:55.847 --> 41:58.381

42:15.700 --> 42:18.868
- I bow out.
We're doing this, again?

42:18.903 --> 42:22.539
I'm so tired of talking about
eddie and wendy's breastacles.

42:22.574 --> 42:25.625
Like, you have
your own set of titties.

42:25.677 --> 42:29.679
Leave wendy alone.
- I think that's reasonable.

42:29.714 --> 42:32.682
- Um, I mean, it would only be
reasonable if the same blog

42:32.717 --> 42:35.418
that reported that didn't
report that you had a std.

42:35.437 --> 42:39.122
- Ahh!
- And-- and I don't.

42:39.157 --> 42:40.356
- I got a headache.
- I mean, perfect.

42:40.392 --> 42:41.824
- It's-- it's in between.
Is it in between?

42:41.860 --> 42:43.793
- It wasn't done this way.
It was done this way.

42:43.828 --> 42:46.312
- I don't think so because then
she continues to talk about me,

42:46.364 --> 42:48.448
and you guys talk about me
at robyn's dinner,

42:48.483 --> 42:50.733
as I was told, and so
it's not reasonable.

42:50.768 --> 42:52.235
- Get over yourself.
- At robyn's dinner?

42:52.270 --> 42:53.236
- It was definitely shady.

42:53.271 --> 42:54.137
- Nobody talked about
you at robyn's dinner.

42:54.172 --> 42:54.988
- Yes, you did.
- It wasn't about you.

42:55.040 --> 42:56.439
- It wasn't-- it wasn't--
it was--

42:56.458 --> 42:58.007
- I'm talking to gizelle.

42:58.043 --> 42:59.008
- It was-- it was about
the interactions

42:59.044 --> 42:59.876
that had happened.

42:59.911 --> 43:01.544
- But I thought you were
good with wendy.

43:01.580 --> 43:02.712
I thought y'all made up.

43:02.747 --> 43:06.132
- No, I mean, I feel like
we talked through everything,

43:06.167 --> 43:08.918
but, in my opinion,
it was still kind of--

43:08.953 --> 43:09.852
- unresolved.
- Yeah.

43:09.888 --> 43:11.638
- It was not malicious
toward you, wendy.

43:11.673 --> 43:12.955
- But it wasn't malicious.
It was about--

43:12.974 --> 43:13.673
- excuse me. Excuse me.

43:13.725 --> 43:14.691
- It was about
what transpired.

43:14.726 --> 43:15.758
- Wendy, chill.
- Stop telling me to chill,

43:15.793 --> 43:16.659
and you're the one that's
hyped. My voice is low.

43:16.695 --> 43:19.012
Why do you keep on
telling me to chill?

43:19.064 --> 43:19.929
- Wendy, like, reallyyou're--
you're doing too much.

43:19.964 --> 43:20.630
- Like, stop.
I-- I'm doing too much,

43:20.649 --> 43:21.814
but I'm
talking like this?

43:21.850 --> 43:23.266
- You're really doing too--
you are doing way too much.

43:23.301 --> 43:24.500
- Everybody.

43:24.536 --> 43:29.022

So, here goes the name--

43:36.715 --> 43:37.780
- you're being an asshole.
- I'm being an asshole

43:37.816 --> 43:38.748
for asking a question?
- You are being an asshole.

43:38.783 --> 43:39.549
No, you're being an asshole
because you were

43:39.584 --> 43:42.201
talking over people.
- For what?

43:42.253 --> 43:43.319
I'm talkig over people.
What?

43:43.338 --> 43:44.988
- You are turning into--
into stuff that they're not.

43:45.023 --> 43:47.423
- When did I talk--
- what I'm trying to say is,

43:47.459 --> 43:49.892
we were not talking
about you at my birthday.

43:49.928 --> 43:50.793
- Karma.
- Well--

43:50.828 --> 43:52.061
- it was about-- it was--
it was about--

43:52.097 --> 43:54.897
- there were about
45 minutes.

43:54.933 --> 43:56.599
It was, like, 40 minutes.
- It was not 45 minutes.

43:56.635 --> 43:59.686
- It was a long time
we were talking about her.

43:59.721 --> 44:00.937
It was.

44:00.972 --> 44:01.804
- No, no, no.
Whoever--

44:01.840 --> 44:02.805
whoever relayed
that message to her,

44:02.841 --> 44:03.556
made it seem like
we were talking against her

44:03.608 --> 44:04.807
or about you.
- I don't tattle.

44:04.842 --> 44:06.576
- We were just talking about
the dynamic of her in the group.

44:06.611 --> 44:08.578
- Don't recl.
- Right.

44:08.613 --> 44:09.379
Ding, ding, ding.
- It was a discussion.

44:09.414 --> 44:10.279
It was a legitimate
discussion.

44:10.315 --> 44:11.114
- I'm not your child.
Don't yell at me.

44:11.149 --> 44:11.781
- (bleep) it, wendy.
- Oh, my god.

44:11.816 --> 44:12.565
Oh, my god.
- I'm done.

44:12.617 --> 44:14.417
I'm so done.
- Don't yell at me.

44:14.452 --> 44:15.318
- Im so done.
- I-I agree with that.

44:15.353 --> 44:16.319
- You are impossible
to get through to.

44:16.354 --> 44:17.854
- Don't yell at me.
- Yeah, just take it all.

44:17.889 --> 44:18.688
- Impossible.

44:18.723 --> 44:19.255
- You're not
getting through to me

44:19.290 --> 44:20.023
if you're yelling at me.

44:20.058 --> 44:20.540
- I'm not yelling
at you, wendy.

44:20.575 --> 44:21.724
- Nobody is yelling.

44:21.760 --> 44:26.412
- All I'm trying to say is,
to the original question--

44:26.464 --> 44:27.714
- what is te question?

44:27.749 --> 44:29.549
- All of y'all have
my phone number.

44:29.584 --> 44:32.468
If anyone was truly concerned,
you can call me,

44:32.504 --> 44:33.970
and no one has.

44:34.005 --> 44:36.673
So, when you sit here
on your soapbox and try to say,

44:36.708 --> 44:38.307
"I'm not
gettin' through to you,"

44:38.343 --> 44:39.976
no, you're not gonna
get through to me.

44:40.011 --> 44:40.810
- Mm-hmm.

44:40.845 --> 44:41.728
- Because if you really
wanted to,

44:41.763 --> 44:43.212
you could have a one-on-one
and call me.

44:43.231 --> 44:44.647
So, let's not play
the theatrics

44:44.683 --> 44:45.715
'cause I'm not here
for that sh-- today.

44:45.734 --> 44:47.100
Thank you.
- I don't-- I don't--

44:47.152 --> 44:48.518
but what is--
I'm confused.

44:48.553 --> 44:50.886
- I didn't say
sh-- to your ass.

44:50.905 --> 44:52.772
It wasn't for your ass
to receive.

44:52.824 --> 44:54.590
I done said what I said
to your ass in williamsburg.

44:54.626 --> 44:55.458
I'm not addressing you
no more.

44:55.493 --> 44:56.392
- Okay, okay, wendy,
why don't you go?

44:56.411 --> 44:57.443
- That's super rude.

44:57.495 --> 44:58.361
- We can back
all these cars out,

44:58.396 --> 44:58.728
and you can go, wendy.
- That's so rude.

44:58.747 --> 44:59.696
- Ooh.

44:59.731 --> 45:01.864
- I'm not gonna be
disrespected in my house.

45:01.899 --> 45:05.918
- Girl, this really paints
a picture of how... You are.

45:05.954 --> 45:07.770
We are in the middle
of your driveway.

45:07.806 --> 45:10.873
We ain't in your house.
This is public property.

45:10.909 --> 45:11.941
- No, she's not.

45:11.976 --> 45:13.643
- Disrespecting your house
but you yell in my house

45:13.678 --> 45:14.594
and disrespect me?
- You can go. You can go.

45:14.629 --> 45:15.712
- No, no, no.
- But I never yelled at you.

45:15.747 --> 45:17.747
- The question you guys asked
was very offensive.

45:17.782 --> 45:18.765
- She's not.

45:18.800 --> 45:20.466
- And then when she
comes back with, you know,

45:20.518 --> 45:22.135
what she's coming back
with something,

45:22.187 --> 45:23.803
you can't be mad at her.

45:23.855 --> 45:25.772
- What is she,
like, the mediator?

45:25.807 --> 45:27.657
- I'm gonna say
what I want to say, mia.

45:27.692 --> 45:29.158
Keep it cute over there, okay?

45:29.194 --> 45:29.976
Don't say stuff
under your breath.

45:30.028 --> 45:30.943
- No, I mean,
you always come in.

45:30.979 --> 45:32.094
- 'cause I'm gonna say
what I have to say.

45:32.113 --> 45:32.929
If you wanna call it--
- I mean, you always come in.

45:32.964 --> 45:35.114
No, I wasn't saying
under my breath.

45:35.150 --> 45:36.065
I said it out lou.
- Well, then be quiet

45:36.101 --> 45:36.833
'cause I'm not talking to you
right now.

45:36.868 --> 45:37.800
I'm talking to gizelle.
- No.

45:37.836 --> 45:38.701
- Can we take turns?
- You can say, "yes,"

45:38.737 --> 45:40.803
'cause that's what
you're trying to do.

45:40.839 --> 45:41.771
-I suggest you sit down andbe qu

45:41.806 --> 45:43.939
- insecure bitches
call other bitches hos,

45:43.958 --> 45:45.508
if you ask me.
- So, now I'm insecure.

45:45.543 --> 45:47.160
So, I'm low budget,
and I'm insecure.

45:47.212 --> 45:48.778
- Okay, gizelle, where--
where you goin' with this party?

45:48.813 --> 45:51.380
I have not sit up here
and got myself "vassinated,"

45:51.416 --> 45:52.749
so I can be around you heifers!

45:52.784 --> 45:55.635
- Is it-is it vaccinated?
- I don't know.

45:55.670 --> 45:56.452
I don't know
what the (bleep) it is,

45:56.488 --> 45:57.687
right now,
but my arm is hurting.

45:57.722 --> 45:58.588
- What word is?

45:59.524 --> 46:01.557
- It's called projection.
- I uplift women.

46:01.593 --> 46:02.892
That's what secure women do.
- It's projection.

46:02.927 --> 46:04.160
I'm the projector.

46:04.195 --> 46:06.195
I'm projecting onto you
what you're projecting onto me.

46:06.231 --> 46:08.147
- Secure women
empower women, okay?

46:08.183 --> 46:10.183
- You are the insecure one.
- I'm fading quickly.

46:10.235 --> 46:13.936
Everything is slow motion,
right now.

46:13.972 --> 46:17.573
- Projection.

46:17.609 --> 46:22.678
[distorted speech]

46:24.749 --> 46:27.049
- hold on.
I got my second shot today,

46:27.085 --> 46:30.152
and all I wanna know, wendy, is,
are you gonna invite everybody

46:30.171 --> 46:34.657
to the-the girls' trip
'cause I think we need it?

46:34.676 --> 46:35.708
- Who is going
on a girls trip?

46:35.760 --> 46:36.509
- Wendy.
- I'm sorry, wendy.

46:36.544 --> 46:37.426
I didn't mean to
out you like that.

46:37.462 --> 46:38.711
My bad.

46:38.763 --> 46:40.996
- I blame this outburst
on the side effects

46:41.015 --> 46:44.217
of the vaccine
because this is not the time

46:44.269 --> 46:46.018
to talk about a couples trip,

46:46.054 --> 46:48.771
especially since some of us
in the group

46:48.807 --> 46:51.057
can't even be part of
a couples trip.

46:51.109 --> 46:52.775
- My bad. My bad. My bad.
- No, it's perfect.

46:52.811 --> 46:56.562
I think that we should do
a quick jaunt.

46:56.614 --> 46:57.396
- Yes, a jaunt.

46:57.448 --> 47:00.015
- And, also,
to bring our husbands.

47:00.034 --> 47:00.917
- Yes!

47:00.952 --> 47:02.568
- Especially since
so many people wanna

47:02.620 --> 47:04.086
keep our husbands names'
in their mouths.

47:04.122 --> 47:05.154
- In their mouth.

47:05.189 --> 47:07.857
- Did she say keep
our husbands in their mouths?

47:07.892 --> 47:08.741
- Name-- name-- their name.
- Their name.

47:08.793 --> 47:10.860
- Oh. Ooh, zip my lips.
- Their names.

47:10.895 --> 47:11.694
[laughing]

47:11.713 --> 47:12.461
you always wanna
talk about somebody,

47:12.497 --> 47:14.547
but you ain't got nobody
but okay,

47:14.582 --> 47:16.249
and it would just be
for a weekend.

47:16.301 --> 47:17.500
- Where we going?
Where we going?

47:17.535 --> 47:21.003
- I'm thinking maybe we can
all go to the chesapeake bay.

47:21.038 --> 47:22.605
- Virginia beach.
Virginia beach.

47:22.640 --> 47:24.140
- Chesapeake is
not virginia beach.

47:24.175 --> 47:25.040
- Chesapeake.
- Oh.

47:25.059 --> 47:26.041
- Chesapeake.
- We're gonna have fun.

47:26.060 --> 47:28.878
Chris is gonna be there.
Dre is gonna be there.

47:28.897 --> 47:29.779
- Yay!

47:29.814 --> 47:30.763
- I don't know if
michael will be there.

47:30.815 --> 47:32.582
I would love for him
to be there, if he could.

47:32.617 --> 47:36.519
And ray is gonna be there.

47:37.906 --> 47:40.823
- To not invite me,
not mention juan,

47:40.859 --> 47:43.092
to throw another dig
at my relationship,

47:43.127 --> 47:46.946
she's just showing more of
how she really feels about me.

47:46.998 --> 47:48.664
- You don't even have
a relationship

47:48.700 --> 47:50.466
to even care about.

47:50.501 --> 47:52.001
- I don't? Okay.

47:52.036 --> 47:53.002
- Yes, she does.

47:53.037 --> 47:54.754
- Which, hey,
if she hates me, that's fine.

47:54.789 --> 47:56.289
Just thank you
for letting me know.

47:56.341 --> 47:58.291
- Ray is gonna be there,
hopefully.

47:58.343 --> 48:01.644
Eddie is gonna be there,
and your--

48:01.679 --> 48:03.079
your luggage
is gonna be there.

48:03.114 --> 48:08.251
♪♪

48:08.385 --> 48:10.519
♪♪

48:10.555 --> 48:11.787

ray is gonna be there,
hopefully.

48:13.858 --> 48:16.993
Eddie is gonna be there,
and your--

48:17.028 --> 48:18.895
your luggage

48:18.930 --> 48:21.364
- Ahh!

48:21.399 --> 48:23.366
- So, thank you
for the invite.

48:23.401 --> 48:25.101
Feel free.

48:25.136 --> 48:27.420
First of all, wendy,
I invited you to my house,

48:27.455 --> 48:28.871
and you came here stank.

48:28.907 --> 48:32.208
Now, you're inviting me
out of town with you,

48:32.243 --> 48:33.960
and you're being stank.

48:34.012 --> 48:35.094
Yeah, no thank you.

48:35.129 --> 48:37.013
- My vaccine kicked in.
I-I'm gonna go ahead and go.

48:37.048 --> 48:38.848
- Same here.
- Bye, everybody.

48:38.883 --> 48:39.982
Whoo.
- Thanks for coming.

48:40.018 --> 48:42.418

48:43.988 --> 48:45.521
- Okay.

48:45.556 --> 48:47.323
- Wait.

48:47.358 --> 48:50.092
The haters didn't even
ask to use the bathroom.

48:50.111 --> 48:50.943
- They didn't.
[laughing]

48:50.979 --> 48:52.428
- I have a question.

48:52.447 --> 48:54.397
This was not an invite
to your house.

48:54.432 --> 48:56.899
I feel disrespected.
[laughing]

48:56.934 --> 48:58.034
- you're gonna go?
- Yes, I am.

48:58.069 --> 48:59.502
- Aww.
We didn't really get to spend

48:59.537 --> 49:01.070
a lotta-- a whole lotta
quality time together.

49:01.105 --> 49:02.939
- I know. It's okay.
I'll come back.

49:02.974 --> 49:03.739
- But I appreciate you.

49:03.775 --> 49:04.941
- See you guys soon, okay?
- Bye.

49:04.976 --> 49:06.208
See you.
- All right.

49:06.244 --> 49:08.411
- I'm gonna take them up
to see my closet.

49:08.446 --> 49:09.161
- Okay.

49:09.213 --> 49:09.879
- Okay, and then
I'll be back out.

49:09.914 --> 49:11.280
Do you need help?
- Hold on.

49:11.299 --> 49:12.665
- Are you sure?
- Just come.

49:12.717 --> 49:14.283
- Honey, I may need help, too.

49:14.319 --> 49:15.618
- How can we get in back here?

49:15.653 --> 49:17.520
- There's a-- there's--
there's a door.

49:17.555 --> 49:20.489
- Okay, this is too-- uh-uh.
I'm gonna come back.

49:20.525 --> 49:21.390
I'll see y'all later.

49:21.426 --> 49:22.158
- You're not supposed
to be doing this.

49:22.193 --> 49:22.959
- Where are you--
where you going?

49:22.994 --> 49:26.295
- Um, send me, um, video.
- Okay.

49:26.314 --> 49:28.097
- This tour wasn't
gonna work out.

49:28.132 --> 49:30.700
When there is, like, actual,
like, stable steps,

49:30.735 --> 49:32.985
when there's a door,
I'll come back.

49:33.021 --> 49:33.970
- How do we get out?

49:34.005 --> 49:36.472
Can we have candiace
come move her vehicle?

49:36.507 --> 49:38.140
- So, this is what I added.
- Oh, yes.

49:38.159 --> 49:40.910
Oh, you-- oh!

Oh, this is nice.

49:51.255 --> 49:55.007
- I'm gonna go ask
candiace to move.

49:55.043 --> 49:56.926
I'm not feeling well.

49:56.961 --> 49:59.712
- I love this floor.
I love the view.

49:59.764 --> 50:01.630
- Mm-hmm.
- But can you be naked?

50:01.665 --> 50:03.265
- Yes.
- No one is here.

50:03.301 --> 50:04.467
- They can't see me.
- They can see you.

50:04.502 --> 50:06.268
- They cannot see me.
- Yes, they can.

50:06.304 --> 50:08.270
- I'll be all the way naked
over here, okay?

50:08.306 --> 50:10.439
- That window,
they're looking at your titties.

50:10.475 --> 50:12.975
- Okay, no, candiace.
[laughing]

50:13.011 --> 50:14.844
- we can't get out.
Candiace blocked us in.

50:14.879 --> 50:16.178
- Just go right through
those doors.

50:16.197 --> 50:17.013
They're in there.

50:17.048 --> 50:18.014
- You go right
through those doors.

50:18.049 --> 50:18.714
How you gonna go through them?
- Right there.

50:18.750 --> 50:20.249
- Those aren't even doors yet.

50:20.284 --> 50:21.884
- I'll call her.
- Okay.

50:21.919 --> 50:24.020
- All right, chaperones.
Watch her foot.

50:24.055 --> 50:26.022
[phone ringing]

50:26.057 --> 50:28.040
oh, it's robyn.
Hello.

50:28.076 --> 50:30.076
- Candiace, you're blocking
everyone in.

50:30.128 --> 50:31.961
- Oh, god.

50:31.996 --> 50:33.245
- Angel can go.
Angel can.

50:33.297 --> 50:34.330
- I can't drive.
- I can drive.

50:34.365 --> 50:36.048
- No, they can--
no, you-- okay, no.

50:36.084 --> 50:37.500
- Grace is ready to drive.
- That's a no,

50:37.535 --> 50:38.884

50:42.340 --> 50:43.756
Can you just move my car?
- Yes.

50:43.808 --> 50:45.257
- Okay.
All right.

50:45.309 --> 50:46.375
- Don't crash my car, grace.

Which one is yours?
[laughing]

50:48.045 --> 50:49.311
- it's the-it's the one
blocking everybody in.

50:49.347 --> 50:51.230
It's the--
the champagne lexus.

50:51.265 --> 50:53.099
- Okay.
- Grace, don't crash my car!

50:53.151 --> 50:54.100
- No, no, no. I won't.
I swear.

50:54.152 --> 50:55.267
- Okay.

50:55.319 --> 50:55.735
She ain't gonna
crash my car, is she?

50:55.770 --> 50:57.253
- No.
- Ahh!

50:57.288 --> 50:58.771

the cameraman, okay.

50:58.823 --> 51:00.573
Brake, brake, brake!
- Brake! Ahh!

51:00.608 --> 51:02.408
- Brake! Brake!

51:02.443 --> 51:04.960

51:07.532 --> 51:09.765
- Uh, you're moving it?
- She told me to move it.

51:09.801 --> 51:10.599
I'm good.

51:10.635 --> 51:11.400
- Are you confident
in doing that?

51:11.419 --> 51:13.602
- I'm confident.
- Holy sh--. She--

51:13.638 --> 51:15.588
- robyn, like, can you
just be in the car with me?

51:15.623 --> 51:17.006
- Oh, my god.
- Just for support.

51:17.041 --> 51:18.307
- Okay.
- Aww, go ahead.

51:18.342 --> 51:19.275
- I'll be back.
- Go ahead.

51:19.310 --> 51:21.010
- I have faith in you, grace.
- Go ahead.

51:21.045 --> 51:22.578
- Are you--

51:24.482 --> 51:25.748

51:25.783 --> 51:27.283
- Oh.
- She is a young driver.

51:27.318 --> 51:28.818
- Candiace told me to move it.

51:28.853 --> 51:30.486
I'm scared.
- Okay, okay.

51:30.521 --> 51:31.253
That's progress.

51:31.289 --> 51:32.321
- Nobody wants to be here
no more.

51:32.356 --> 51:34.590
If I stay here too long,
I'm gonna end up miserable
