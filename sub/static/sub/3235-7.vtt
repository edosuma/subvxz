Breaking Bad...</i>

00:06.035 --> 00:07.882
<i>It was all about
sending a message.</i>

00:08.018 --> 00:10.382
Which they did.
"Ready to talk?"

00:10.502 --> 00:12.955
Jesse? What about you?
No judgments.

00:13.100 --> 00:16.536
Tim stopped by. He brought
over some file boxes on that case.

00:16.997 --> 00:18.944
Since when the vegans
eat fried chicken?

00:19.040 --> 00:20.433
Hey, excuse me.
Why me?

00:20.534 --> 00:22.281
I like to think
I see things in people.

00:24.359 --> 00:29.711
That car contradicts our story.
It goes back tomorrow.

How's Junior?

02:39.507 --> 02:41.976
Oh, exactly what I expected.

02:42.010 --> 02:43.211
He hasn't said a word to me

02:43.245 --> 02:45.480
since we told him
it was going back.

02:45.515 --> 02:49.084
I spoke to the dealership.
They didn't want to take it.

02:49.119 --> 02:50.186
What?

02:51.855 --> 02:53.188
It's in perfect condition.

02:53.223 --> 02:55.791
It's got 17 miles
on the odometer.

02:55.825 --> 02:58.093
I know. I spent
the better part of an hour

02:58.128 --> 03:00.896
sweet-talking the manager
down to a restocking fee--

03:00.930 --> 03:03.232
$800.

03:03.266 --> 03:05.834
$800... for two days?

03:05.869 --> 03:09.404
Well, the law says they don't
have to take it back at all.

03:09.439 --> 03:12.174
All right,
here's the registration,

03:12.209 --> 03:13.643
and the window sticker,
the receipt.

03:13.677 --> 03:16.146
Oh, and make sure you talk
to the general manager.

03:16.180 --> 03:18.181
His name is Glen.

03:18.215 --> 03:19.649
Glen.

03:19.684 --> 03:21.017
Call me if there's a problem.

03:21.052 --> 03:23.788
And please, just don't--

03:23.822 --> 03:25.523
don't tangle with anyone.

03:30.996 --> 03:32.396
Fine.

03:33.699 --> 03:36.300
Oh! <i>Bueno, Martine.</i>
<i>Muy bueno.</i>

03:36.335 --> 03:37.435
Walt.

04:18.579 --> 04:21.148
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

04:25.486 --> 04:27.320
Hoo! Whoo!

04:51.447 --> 04:52.581
Shit.

05:07.129 --> 05:08.630
God.

06:50.167 --> 06:52.168
Yes. Hello.

06:52.203 --> 06:53.470
I need a cab.

06:55.239 --> 06:57.108
Yes, thank you.
The name is White.

06:59.411 --> 07:03.815
Uh, I'm at the
Pavilion parking lot

07:03.849 --> 07:06.084
on University.

07:06.118 --> 07:08.720
Oh, yes, that's right.
Just south of the airport.

07:10.256 --> 07:11.623
Oh, that'd be great.
Thank you.

07:11.657 --> 07:14.760
Oh, how long do you
think that would take.

07:20.432 --> 07:22.200
No, I'm sure he'll see me.

07:22.234 --> 07:23.368
Thank you.

07:27.673 --> 07:28.673
Contrition?

07:28.707 --> 07:30.308
Hey, there's--

07:30.342 --> 07:31.376
There's total contrition here!

07:31.410 --> 07:34.479
There's mountains
of contrition!

07:34.513 --> 07:36.014
Fan-tan-tastic!

07:36.048 --> 07:38.117
I will messenger
'em over right away.

07:38.151 --> 07:39.351
Oh, and--

07:39.386 --> 07:41.287
about that
other thing unrelated--

07:41.321 --> 07:43.223
Yes, I can get you in.

07:43.257 --> 07:47.127
But I gotta warn you,
the eighth hole is murder.

07:47.161 --> 07:49.796
Oh, yeah? You want
to make it interesting?

07:49.831 --> 07:51.965
Great! Tee time 7 a.m. sharp.

07:51.999 --> 07:53.933
Prepare to have
your ass handed to you.

07:53.967 --> 07:55.368
Okay. Bye.

07:57.337 --> 07:59.172
He was headed for
destruction of property,

07:59.206 --> 08:01.107
but since it's
your own property,

08:01.141 --> 08:05.110
I sweated him down to
misdemeanor trash burning.

08:06.279 --> 08:08.480
The only thing is,
it's not gonna be free.

08:08.514 --> 08:10.482
There's a 5 grand fine,

08:10.516 --> 08:12.451
600 for towing and disposal,

08:12.485 --> 08:15.020
another 3 grand
to steam clean the blacktop.

08:15.055 --> 08:18.024
So bottom line, your little
joyride's gonna set you back

08:18.058 --> 08:20.760
about 52,000 bucks, so...

08:20.794 --> 08:23.063
was it worth it?

08:23.097 --> 08:24.898
I don't need to hear
the blow-by-blow.

08:24.933 --> 08:26.968
Just tell me it's done.

08:27.002 --> 08:29.170
I'm sorry, did I wake you?

08:29.205 --> 08:32.374
I caught this thing
before it got into the system.

08:32.408 --> 08:33.875
That means
your record stays clean.

08:33.909 --> 08:35.076
The wife never finds out.

08:35.110 --> 08:36.376
I've been working magic here.

08:36.410 --> 08:38.979
I can at least get
an "attaboy."

08:40.582 --> 08:42.049
Fine. Rebel without a cause,

08:42.082 --> 08:43.384
give.

08:56.597 --> 08:58.765
What is it, Fring?

09:00.434 --> 09:02.769
He will see me dead...

09:02.804 --> 09:05.306
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

09:05.340 --> 09:09.210
All that's left is to wait.

09:12.515 --> 09:14.316
And we're sure about this.

09:14.350 --> 09:17.252
'Cause Pinkman ss
he needs you too much.

09:17.286 --> 09:18.620
"Pinkman says."

09:24.662 --> 09:26.163
"Pinkman says."

09:31.970 --> 09:34.071
Unless...

09:34.105 --> 09:37.773
you could help me
find a third party.

09:37.808 --> 09:40.443
What third party?

09:40.477 --> 09:43.846
Someone who can
ameliorate the situation.

09:43.880 --> 09:47.382
Let's ditch the thesaurus,
all right?

09:47.416 --> 09:49.650
You talking about a hit man?

09:49.685 --> 09:52.086
Assuming that's still
what they're called.

09:52.121 --> 09:54.088
Zzzzt! Wrong answer!

09:54.123 --> 09:56.924
That's what the kids
call "epic fail."

09:56.959 --> 09:59.227
All I would
need is a phone number.

09:59.262 --> 10:00.962
I would do the rest.

10:00.997 --> 10:03.632
Saul, there'd be
a finder's fee.

10:03.666 --> 10:04.934
A big one.

10:04.968 --> 10:06.936
Look, if you held
my feet to the fire,

10:06.970 --> 10:09.038
I could come up
with a couple names--

10:09.072 --> 10:10.807
One or two guys
west of the Rockies

10:10.841 --> 10:12.008
who do this kind of work--

10:12.043 --> 10:13.310
But guess what.

10:13.344 --> 10:15.145
These guys?
They know Mike.

10:15.179 --> 10:17.281
- And Mike knows them.
- What are you telling me?

10:17.315 --> 10:19.850
Mike knows everyone
who does this?

10:19.885 --> 10:21.585
Who do you think
gave me their names?

10:21.620 --> 10:23.587
Okay, Plan B.

10:23.622 --> 10:25.423
Look, we go outside
my network--

10:25.458 --> 10:28.427
Craigslist, <i>Soldier of Fortune.</i>

10:28.461 --> 10:29.995
Let's say we get lucky,

10:30.030 --> 10:31.497
I mean, incredibly lucky,

10:31.532 --> 10:33.767
and find a guy who's
not an undercover cop

10:33.801 --> 10:36.769
or some kind of survivalist
nut-job wannabe.

10:36.803 --> 10:40.273
You gotta ask yourself--
How good is good enough?

10:40.308 --> 10:41.775
Because whatever goomba we buy

10:41.809 --> 10:43.410
at some point is gonna
come head-to-head

10:43.445 --> 10:44.511
with our friend Mike.

10:44.546 --> 10:45.913
And Gus Fring?

10:45.947 --> 10:47.649
Just winging that guy

10:47.683 --> 10:50.585
is not gonna ameliorate
your situation,

10:50.619 --> 10:52.486
not by a damn sight.

10:52.521 --> 10:55.990
I tried to, but I can't
get anywhere near him.

10:56.024 --> 10:57.457
You can't get near him?

10:57.492 --> 10:59.827
Why don't you ask your partner?

11:03.331 --> 11:05.567
Yeah, I saw him.

11:07.536 --> 11:10.172
And you tell Saul
before you tell me?

11:10.206 --> 11:12.875
Look, he's my lawyer,
same as yours.

11:12.909 --> 11:14.576
Every time I go over there,

11:14.611 --> 11:16.345
Saul hassles me about Mike.

11:16.379 --> 11:19.282
He's still scared the dude's
gonna come break his legs.

11:19.316 --> 11:22.151
So I give him the latest.

11:22.185 --> 11:24.287
But what happened exactly?

11:24.321 --> 11:27.691
I was at a diner with Mike,

11:27.726 --> 11:31.695
and he just shows up.

11:31.730 --> 11:34.131
They send me outside
and the two of them talk.

11:34.165 --> 11:35.299
That's it.

11:37.435 --> 11:40.170
So this is, like,
a regular thing?

11:42.140 --> 11:44.341
How close were you to him?

11:44.376 --> 11:45.876
Close.

11:45.910 --> 11:48.879
Closer than you
and me right now.

11:51.483 --> 11:52.717
Did he speak to you?

11:58.089 --> 12:00.090
It was over in 10 seconds.

12:00.124 --> 12:01.925
Would you just answer?

12:03.528 --> 12:05.362
He said he sees things
in people.

12:07.098 --> 12:10.400
What things? What people?

12:10.435 --> 12:11.902
Me.

12:11.936 --> 12:14.437
He said he sees
something in me.

12:19.877 --> 12:21.645
A month ago,

12:21.679 --> 12:24.881
Gus was trying
to kill both of us,

12:24.916 --> 12:26.983
and now he pulls you
out of the lab

12:27.018 --> 12:29.786
and employs you as...

12:29.821 --> 12:32.088
what, an assistant gunman?

12:32.123 --> 12:34.191
A tough guy?

12:34.225 --> 12:36.326
Does that make
any sense to you?

12:38.496 --> 12:41.064
He says he sees
something in you.

12:43.501 --> 12:45.802
What kind of game
is he playing?

12:45.837 --> 12:47.704
Does he think
you're that naive?

12:50.408 --> 12:54.077
He can't truly think
that you'd forget--

12:54.111 --> 12:56.914
Well, let alone Gale,

12:56.948 --> 12:59.683
let alone Victor,

12:59.717 --> 13:02.719
and all the horror that goes
along with all of that.

13:02.753 --> 13:05.522
What about this
girlfriend of yours

13:05.556 --> 13:07.958
and her little brother?

13:07.992 --> 13:11.027
The man looked you
straight in the eye

13:11.061 --> 13:13.063
and told you
"no more children,"

13:13.097 --> 13:16.399
but that very night,
that little boy...

13:18.703 --> 13:20.537
he winds up...

13:23.074 --> 13:26.276
Gus can't possibly think
that you'd forget that.

13:27.745 --> 13:29.946
- Okay.
- I mean, all I'm saying is that

13:29.980 --> 13:35.286
is it possible he would think
that you're that weak-willed?

13:35.320 --> 13:37.822
Drop the sales pitch.

13:37.856 --> 13:39.524
I'll do it.

13:39.558 --> 13:41.760
You'll do what?

13:44.597 --> 13:46.832
I'll kill him...

13:46.867 --> 13:48.701
first chance I get.

14:09.255 --> 14:12.658
Piña colada?
More like stale bubblegum.

14:12.692 --> 14:14.460
Does anyone actually
want their car to smell like

14:14.494 --> 14:16.629
the bottom of
a sixth-grader's desk?

14:16.663 --> 14:18.698
Okay. Hemp? Really?

14:18.732 --> 14:20.566
Yeah, I know.
But you know what they say--

14:20.601 --> 14:22.067
The customer's always right.

14:22.102 --> 14:24.403
Ooh! Speaking of customer,

14:24.437 --> 14:26.172
it's not too late
to have a grand opening.

14:26.206 --> 14:29.575
I was thinking
huge party, balloons,

14:29.609 --> 14:31.010
bouncy house for the kids,

14:31.044 --> 14:32.645
you know, make a splash,
get on TV.

14:32.679 --> 14:34.613
Let people know they're
not gonna have to face

14:34.647 --> 14:36.681
the eyebrows of doom
when they come in.

14:38.451 --> 14:41.253
Marie, how's Hank doing?

14:41.287 --> 14:43.756
You know what?
He's doing better.

14:43.790 --> 14:45.091
Really?

14:45.125 --> 14:47.794
Yeah. Uh...

14:47.828 --> 14:50.263
lately his mood's improved,

14:50.298 --> 14:53.700
and he's like a maniac
with his P.T.

14:53.735 --> 14:55.536
- That's fantastic.
- Yeah, don't get me wrong.

14:55.570 --> 14:57.505
He's got a long way to go,
but he--

14:58.707 --> 14:59.807
Yeah. I mean--

14:59.841 --> 15:01.675
- Oh, hey.
- Hey!

15:01.709 --> 15:03.343
- Hi, Walt.
- Marie.

15:03.378 --> 15:05.212
- It's good to see you.
- You, too.

15:05.246 --> 15:08.882
Hey, your cashier here
is quite the salesperson.

15:08.916 --> 15:10.950
She just talked me into
something called

15:10.985 --> 15:13.019
the Orbital Paste Wax Buff.

15:13.053 --> 15:14.820
Oh, yeah.
No, it's very important

15:14.854 --> 15:16.021
to maintain your clear coat.

15:16.056 --> 15:17.990
Boy, once that goes--

15:18.024 --> 15:19.124
Oh, yeah.

15:19.158 --> 15:21.860
Um, hi.

15:21.895 --> 15:23.095
Hi.

15:27.801 --> 15:31.738
Bogdan was averaging
19 cars during rush hour,

15:31.772 --> 15:33.907
and we are already up to 22--

15:33.941 --> 15:35.742
22 actual cars.

15:35.777 --> 15:39.813
Lat night, I deposited $3,800.

15:41.816 --> 15:45.418
Jesus. How much is that?

15:45.452 --> 15:48.687
$274,000.

15:48.722 --> 15:50.222
Give or take.

15:50.256 --> 15:52.424
- Give or take?
- Yeah.

15:53.627 --> 15:55.828
I haven't counted it.

15:55.862 --> 15:57.429
Wait...

15:57.464 --> 16:02.234
274,000--
And this is how often?

16:02.269 --> 16:03.870
Every two weeks.

16:06.005 --> 16:08.474
Thursday's good
for a drop-off?

16:08.509 --> 16:10.476
Wait, Walt.

16:10.511 --> 16:12.045
Are you telling me

16:12.079 --> 16:18.018
you make $7,125,000 a year?

16:18.052 --> 16:20.621
7 1/2 even,

16:20.655 --> 16:22.256
before expenses.

16:22.290 --> 16:25.224
But I can't--

16:25.259 --> 16:27.460
This is too much.

16:27.494 --> 16:30.229
So it's more than you thought,

16:30.264 --> 16:32.765
and this is somehow bad news?

16:32.800 --> 16:35.501
No, that's not the point.

16:35.536 --> 16:39.005
I mean, there is
no car wash in the world

16:39.039 --> 16:41.440
that could do
this kind of business.

16:41.474 --> 16:45.878
I mean, this is 9 month's
work here minimum.

16:45.912 --> 16:49.381
7 million?
That could take years.

16:49.415 --> 16:51.850
So set some aside.
Save it for a rainy day.

16:51.884 --> 16:53.852
Save it. What--

16:53.886 --> 16:56.253
Save it where?
I can't go to the bank with it.

16:56.288 --> 16:59.022
I sure can't leave it here.

17:00.324 --> 17:01.792
Ohh...
Oi.

17:01.826 --> 17:05.561
Wait a minute.
Is this all 50s?

17:05.597 --> 17:07.698
Who pays for a car wash
with a 50?

17:07.732 --> 17:10.367
Skyler, I didn't
ask you to do this.

17:10.401 --> 17:11.602
I was under the impression

17:11.636 --> 17:13.337
that you had this
under control.

17:13.372 --> 17:17.007
I just didn't expect
this amount of money.

17:17.041 --> 17:19.010
The 50s are gonna be a problem.

17:19.044 --> 17:22.079
Well, that's what this is--
Problem solving.

17:22.113 --> 17:24.615
Skyler, this is a simple
division of labor.

17:24.648 --> 17:26.316
I bring in the money,
you launder the money.

17:26.351 --> 17:27.684
This is what you wanted.

17:27.719 --> 17:30.254
I never wanted any of this.

17:30.288 --> 17:32.423
I've got to go.

17:32.457 --> 17:35.159
If you want out,
just say that you want out.

17:46.372 --> 17:47.839
Okay, then.

19:03.418 --> 19:06.420
You're telling me
you made this in the lab?

19:06.454 --> 19:08.456
Why not?

19:08.490 --> 19:10.992
Making it in his own lab...

19:11.027 --> 19:12.627
seemed appropriate.

19:12.662 --> 19:14.730
There's not much of it.

19:14.764 --> 19:16.599
We had more for Tuco.

19:16.633 --> 19:18.735
It's enough.

19:18.769 --> 19:20.870
This is still the best way.

19:20.905 --> 19:22.305
You go after him with a gun,

19:22.340 --> 19:23.974
you'll never get
out of it alive.

19:24.008 --> 19:25.976
But with this,

19:26.010 --> 19:28.011
you slip it into
his food or drink,

19:28.045 --> 19:30.614
there shouldn't be
any taste or smell,

19:30.648 --> 19:34.585
36 hours later, poof.

19:35.587 --> 19:37.021
A man his age,

19:37.055 --> 19:39.224
working as hard as he does,

19:39.258 --> 19:40.925
no one will be surprised.

19:44.630 --> 19:47.065
What about Mike?

19:47.100 --> 19:48.633
Mike can have his suspicions,

19:48.668 --> 19:50.869
but that's all they'll be.

19:50.904 --> 19:52.237
Please,

19:52.272 --> 19:54.406
one homicidal maniac at a time.

20:03.816 --> 20:07.953
I don't know when
I'm gonna see Gus again...

20:07.987 --> 20:09.354
I mean, if ever.

20:12.025 --> 20:14.159
Keep it with you.

20:14.193 --> 20:17.095
When you have the opportunity,

20:17.129 --> 20:18.863
be ready.

20:21.433 --> 20:22.968
What if they search me?

20:25.938 --> 20:27.907
Will they do that?

21:18.925 --> 21:21.427
It's the wrong way around.

21:24.164 --> 21:26.599
It's my lucky cigarette.

21:29.236 --> 21:32.872
Well, whatever you do,
don't smoke it.

21:34.808 --> 21:37.243
You know they
have a drive-thru, right?

21:37.278 --> 21:39.345
Nah, this is good.

21:39.380 --> 21:41.647
Could use the exercise.
Get he blood pumping.

21:42.849 --> 21:44.016
Don't worry,

21:44.050 --> 21:45.818
you're not gonna
have to pick me up.

21:45.852 --> 21:48.854
It might take me a while,
but I'll get there.

21:51.190 --> 21:54.092
Jesus, ain't we a pair?

21:54.127 --> 21:56.161
You must really like chicken.

21:57.798 --> 22:00.899
V-8, 470 horses,

22:00.933 --> 22:02.501
20-inch rims,

22:02.535 --> 22:04.603
satellite radio, Bluetooth,

22:04.637 --> 22:08.139
0 to 60 in 4.7 seconds.

22:08.174 --> 22:10.642
Whoa. What do you mean,
on a lark?

22:10.676 --> 22:13.144
Spur of the moment,
your dad just ups and buys you

22:13.178 --> 22:15.279
a brand-new Challenger?

22:15.313 --> 22:18.615
Yeah, I barely got
around the block

22:18.650 --> 22:21.852
and Mom said
we couldn't afford it,

22:21.886 --> 22:23.487
so they took it back.

22:23.522 --> 22:25.356
Do you know how long I had it?

22:25.391 --> 22:27.125
Fifteen hours.

22:27.160 --> 22:29.962
Well, hey, buddy,
let me tell you something.

22:29.996 --> 22:32.898
When I was your age,

22:32.933 --> 22:34.233
I'd have given my left nut

22:34.268 --> 22:37.403
to drive a car like that
for 15 minutes.

22:37.438 --> 22:39.706
But seriously,
how does that happen?

22:39.740 --> 22:43.010
Well, we were looking
at used cars,

22:43.044 --> 22:44.044
and I kind of--
Ahh.

22:44.078 --> 22:45.278
You guilted him into it.

22:45.313 --> 22:46.680
Yeah, yeah.
I know. I hear you.

22:46.714 --> 22:49.615
You pulled the old "Poor little
me and my little troubles."

22:49.650 --> 22:51.817
- Am I right?
- Maybe.

22:51.851 --> 22:53.752
Yeah, well, you flew too
close to the sun, my friend.

22:53.786 --> 22:55.820
You'd have let him
buy you a clunker

22:55.855 --> 22:57.289
you'd be driving now,

22:57.323 --> 22:59.891
instead of borrowing
Mom's hooptie.

22:59.926 --> 23:01.292
Agent Schrader.

23:01.327 --> 23:02.994
- Oh, hey. How you doing?
- Well, thank you.

23:03.028 --> 23:04.195
Good to see you.

23:04.229 --> 23:06.531
Walter Junior,
do you remember Mr. Fring?

23:06.566 --> 23:08.733
- How are you?
- Well. Nice to see you again.

23:08.767 --> 23:10.634
It's a pleasure
to see you here.

23:10.669 --> 23:11.735
You're looking very well.

23:11.770 --> 23:13.103
Yeah, well, you know,

23:13.138 --> 23:16.039
chalk it up to clean living
and vitamin pills.

23:17.141 --> 23:18.908
I must apologize.

23:18.943 --> 23:20.343
If I had seen you come in,

23:20.377 --> 23:21.543
there would have been
no question

23:21.578 --> 23:22.778
of accepting your money.

23:22.813 --> 23:25.014
In the future,
please feel free to ask for me.

23:25.048 --> 23:27.450
A DEA hero should never have

23:27.484 --> 23:28.918
to pay for a meal
at Pollos Hermanos.

23:28.952 --> 23:30.019
No kidding?

23:30.053 --> 23:32.922
I'll take you up
on that for sure.

23:32.956 --> 23:34.723
And how are
your mother and father?

23:34.758 --> 23:36.558
They're good.

23:36.592 --> 23:37.893
The chicken is great.

23:37.927 --> 23:39.361
Thank you.

23:39.396 --> 23:41.997
If ever you're interested
in rewarding part-time work,

23:42.031 --> 23:43.999
perhaps something after school?

23:44.034 --> 23:45.034
My door is always open.

23:45.068 --> 23:46.736
Sounds good.

23:46.770 --> 23:48.538
Uh, I don't know
about this one.

23:48.572 --> 23:51.208
He might eat up
all your profits.

23:51.242 --> 23:53.143
Well, I'll let you
finish your meal.

23:53.178 --> 23:54.878
Can I get you anything else?

23:54.913 --> 23:56.680
A refill, perhaps?

23:56.715 --> 23:58.282
No, thank you.
I'm good.

23:58.317 --> 24:00.618
Sure. Take a Diet Coke.
Thank you very much.

24:00.652 --> 24:01.953
Of course.

24:34.900 --> 24:36.601
So where are we going?

24:36.636 --> 24:41.340
Oh, big doings today.

24:41.375 --> 24:47.114
The order of the day
is eyes open, mouth shut.

25:30.291 --> 25:31.325
S'up?

25:38.499 --> 25:42.737
Test, test.

25:42.771 --> 25:44.505
You got me?

25:44.540 --> 25:46.540
Count off.

25:56.953 --> 25:58.220
Let's go.

26:00.657 --> 26:03.326
Right here.
Leave the wrap on, please.

26:06.397 --> 26:07.731
You know how to make coffee?

26:09.267 --> 26:10.234
Sure.

26:10.268 --> 26:11.569
There you go.

26:14.206 --> 26:16.874
- You want a rundown?
- Please.

26:16.909 --> 26:19.043
Three guys
up at the gate--

26:19.077 --> 26:20.544
Two visible, one in the blind.

26:20.579 --> 26:24.614
We got five guys down here
with a backup out of sight.

26:24.648 --> 26:27.050
I got Tyrus
down in the treeline

26:27.084 --> 26:28.284
with a Barret .50.

26:28.318 --> 26:29.552
Planted him there last night

26:29.586 --> 26:31.386
in case we had
any early arrivals.

26:57.347 --> 26:59.448
I don't have an extra holster.

26:59.483 --> 27:01.183
You stick this in your pocket.

27:01.218 --> 27:03.519
Keep it out of sight.

27:03.553 --> 27:06.389
If you're gonna be here today,
you're gonna have a gun.

27:11.395 --> 27:12.462
It's loaded?

27:14.798 --> 27:16.331
I don't want to see
that in your hand

27:16.366 --> 27:17.799
unless you see me with mine.

27:17.834 --> 27:19.201
Understood?

27:19.235 --> 27:21.303
Emergency only.

27:22.872 --> 27:24.639
First car is coming.

27:29.211 --> 27:31.779
All right, what's
the order of the day?

27:31.814 --> 27:33.448
Eyes open, mouth shut.

28:38.350 --> 28:40.218
A lot of guns.

28:40.252 --> 28:43.320
Nobody's asking you
to give up yours.

28:46.392 --> 28:48.860
You want to sweep the place
before you bring in your guys?

28:50.496 --> 28:52.330
I am the guy.

28:55.635 --> 28:57.035
All right, then.

31:52.013 --> 31:53.780
You got something of mine?

32:01.057 --> 32:02.224
Glove box.

32:06.863 --> 32:09.632
Figure I better
teach you how to shoot.

32:09.666 --> 32:11.534
Could be things
are gonna get hairy.

32:14.570 --> 32:17.105
What is this?

32:17.140 --> 32:18.840
You're giving me a gun?

32:18.875 --> 32:23.510
And now I'm, like, part
of the team or whatever?

32:26.714 --> 32:28.715
He said he sees
something in me.

32:30.718 --> 32:31.751
Like what?

32:35.923 --> 32:39.626
If I had to put it in a word...

32:39.660 --> 32:41.628
I'd guess...

32:41.662 --> 32:43.230
loyalty.

32:43.264 --> 32:44.598
Loyalty.

32:49.469 --> 32:51.804
Only maybe you got it
for the wrong guy.

33:09.743 --> 33:10.810
Jesse?

33:12.113 --> 33:13.413
Hey.

33:13.447 --> 33:14.414
Hey.

33:14.448 --> 33:15.815
Long time, no see.

33:18.753 --> 33:20.120
How you doing?

33:20.154 --> 33:22.689
Yeah, you know, uh...

33:22.724 --> 33:23.957
good.

33:23.991 --> 33:25.859
Good.

33:25.893 --> 33:27.227
Good.

33:29.397 --> 33:31.299
Okay, we're going
to get started.

33:31.333 --> 33:32.466
You coming in?

33:36.572 --> 33:38.973
So the truth is
we can't change the past.

33:39.008 --> 33:40.108
What's done is done.

33:40.142 --> 33:41.876
We've got to own our actions,

33:41.910 --> 33:44.011
but putting ourselves on trial,

33:44.046 --> 33:46.681
acting as our own judge,
jury, and executioner,

33:46.715 --> 33:47.848
it's not the answer

33:47.883 --> 33:50.451
because a lot of the time
all that judging does

33:50.485 --> 33:54.823
is just ensure that we're
going to repeat the cycle.

33:54.857 --> 33:55.991
Right.

33:56.992 --> 33:59.461
"I'm such an asshhole."

33:59.496 --> 34:01.630
"It's totally hopeless."

34:01.664 --> 34:03.299
"What's the point?"

34:03.333 --> 34:05.335
"I think I'll have a hit."

34:06.637 --> 34:07.804
Jesse.

34:07.839 --> 34:10.741
What's going on
with you these days?

34:15.112 --> 34:18.348
I went back to the crystal.

34:18.382 --> 34:20.150
You sober now?

34:20.185 --> 34:21.552
Yeah.

34:21.585 --> 34:24.655
Four days.
Big whoop, right?

34:24.688 --> 34:26.590
Four days is four days.

34:26.625 --> 34:28.192
You're here.

34:28.226 --> 34:33.697
You still...
working at the laundry?

34:33.732 --> 34:35.166
How are things there.

34:35.199 --> 34:37.702
Sucks ass.

34:40.505 --> 34:42.440
Anything
you want to talk about?

34:46.447 --> 34:47.714
Uh...

34:52.585 --> 34:54.286
a couple of weeks back...

34:55.856 --> 34:57.357
I, uh...

34:57.391 --> 34:59.726
killed a dog.

35:02.729 --> 35:04.963
You hit it with your car?

35:07.834 --> 35:09.434
No, um...

35:10.669 --> 35:12.270
I put him down.

35:13.673 --> 35:15.708
I watched him go.

35:15.742 --> 35:17.977
I was looking him
straight in the eye

35:18.011 --> 35:19.011
and...

35:21.382 --> 35:22.983
you know, he didn't know
what was happening.

35:23.017 --> 35:24.518
He didn't know why.
He--

35:26.255 --> 35:29.291
He was just scared, and then...

35:31.695 --> 35:33.396
he was gone.

35:33.430 --> 35:36.065
He was suffering.

35:36.100 --> 35:38.001
It was a kindness.

35:38.035 --> 35:41.271
No, he wasn't sick.

35:44.275 --> 35:46.242
No, he was just, like a...

35:47.978 --> 35:50.613
I don't know, like a...

35:50.648 --> 35:53.082
problem dog.

35:53.117 --> 35:55.051
What did he do?

35:55.085 --> 35:56.285
Bite someone?

35:59.390 --> 36:03.093
Uh, this dog never--
never bit anybody.

36:03.128 --> 36:04.628
He was, uh...

36:04.662 --> 36:09.133
You pick up the rock,
you go right to the dark side.

36:09.167 --> 36:11.235
Anything can happen.

36:11.269 --> 36:13.003
It ain't no rock
that made me do it.

36:13.037 --> 36:14.305
Well, what was the problem?

36:14.339 --> 36:15.506
Why did you have to kill him?

36:15.540 --> 36:17.375
Watch the cross-talk,
please.

36:19.511 --> 36:21.679
Maybe it's not the details
that matter.

36:21.713 --> 36:23.347
Right?

36:23.382 --> 36:26.050
How'd you feel about
what you did, Jesse?

36:28.920 --> 36:31.155
I don't know.

36:32.491 --> 36:35.693
Who cares how you feel?

36:35.728 --> 36:38.397
What kind of a person
kills a dog for no reason?

36:38.431 --> 36:39.631
Colleen.

36:39.665 --> 36:41.099
You put an ad in the paper.

36:41.133 --> 36:42.367
You drop him off at a shelter.

36:42.401 --> 36:43.635
- Colleen--
- You just don't sit there

36:43.669 --> 36:44.836
and talk about killing
a helpless--

36:44.871 --> 36:46.205
- Colleen.
- ...innocent animal.

36:47.674 --> 36:49.975
We're not here
to sit in judgment.

36:50.009 --> 36:52.077
Why not?

36:53.680 --> 36:56.749
Why not? Maybe--
Maybe she's right.

36:56.783 --> 36:58.284
You know, maybe I should
have put it in the paper.

36:58.318 --> 37:00.753
Maybe I should have
done something different.

37:03.056 --> 37:04.557
The thing is,

37:04.591 --> 37:08.294
if you just do stuff
and nothing happens...

37:10.230 --> 37:12.531
what's it all mean?

37:12.565 --> 37:14.366
What's the point?

37:16.336 --> 37:20.706
All right, this whole thing
is about self-acceptance.

37:20.740 --> 37:22.441
Kicking the hell
out of yourself

37:22.475 --> 37:24.176
doesn't give meaning
to anything.

37:24.211 --> 37:27.847
So I should stop judging...

37:29.149 --> 37:31.884
- and accept--
- It's a start.

37:31.919 --> 37:34.387
So, no matter what I do,

37:34.421 --> 37:36.956
hooray for me
because I'm a great guy?

37:36.991 --> 37:38.959
It's all good?

37:38.993 --> 37:41.262
No matter how many dogs I kill,

37:41.296 --> 37:44.199
I just what, do an inventory

37:44.233 --> 37:45.967
and accept?

37:48.672 --> 37:51.107
I mean, you back your truck
over your own kid

37:51.141 --> 37:53.176
and you, like, accept?

37:54.678 --> 37:56.146
What a load of crap!

37:56.180 --> 37:59.082
Hey, Jesse,
I know you're in pain.

37:59.116 --> 38:00.350
No, y-you know what?

38:01.786 --> 38:04.520
Why I'm here
in the first place?

38:06.858 --> 38:09.192
Is to sell you meth.

38:12.162 --> 38:15.498
You're nothing to me
but customers!

38:19.436 --> 38:21.470
I made you my bitch.

38:21.504 --> 38:23.872
You okay with that?

38:23.906 --> 38:25.306
Huh?

38:25.341 --> 38:27.208
You accept?

38:29.678 --> 38:30.845
No.

38:40.555 --> 38:42.389
About time.

39:12.721 --> 39:15.222
Jesse. Jesse.

39:15.256 --> 39:17.458
Bring that light
over here, will you?

39:30.305 --> 39:32.205
You see any residue there?

39:33.374 --> 39:34.340
Where?

39:34.375 --> 39:38.011
Here. On the bottom,
right-- right there.

39:40.881 --> 39:42.248
It's been a week.

39:42.282 --> 39:44.283
What's going on?

39:44.318 --> 39:46.386
I haven't seen him.

39:49.022 --> 39:50.256
I didn't think so,

39:50.290 --> 39:52.124
but I'll just give it
another shot anyway.

40:16.214 --> 40:17.715
- Hey-hey-hey, buddy!
- Hey.

40:17.749 --> 40:20.451
Look at that.
Graduated to doorman.

40:20.486 --> 40:21.820
Finally found your calling.

40:21.854 --> 40:24.689
Ha ha! Ooh!
Little whiskers, Marie.

40:24.724 --> 40:28.260
What did you do, show your
barber a picture of a dog's ass

40:28.294 --> 40:29.628
and said "I'll take that"?

40:29.662 --> 40:33.097
Charming as usual.
Welcome back.

40:33.131 --> 40:34.498
Looking good, Marie.

40:34.533 --> 40:36.233
Oh, thanks, Steve.
Good to see you.

40:36.267 --> 40:37.634
- How you doing?
- He's doing fine.

40:37.668 --> 40:39.269
We, uh, we can
take it from here.

40:39.303 --> 40:40.637
- Right, Gomie?
- Yeah.

40:40.671 --> 40:42.739
If you want to hold his elbow.

40:42.773 --> 40:44.406
No, no, no, no.
You keep your mitts off me.

40:44.441 --> 40:45.708
I'm good, I'm good.

40:49.579 --> 40:50.579
Hey.

40:52.215 --> 40:53.582
Good luck.

40:58.489 --> 41:00.990
Let's go.
Running late. Come on.

41:05.831 --> 41:08.199
Hank,
seeing you walk in--

41:08.233 --> 41:10.501
I can't tell you what that
means to all of us.

41:10.536 --> 41:13.804
Your progress, it's incredible.

41:13.839 --> 41:15.673
Yeah, well, chalk it up

41:15.707 --> 41:17.308
to can living
and vitamin pills.

41:18.577 --> 41:19.944
Steve tell you his news?

41:19.978 --> 41:23.413
What?
Finally got your period?

41:23.448 --> 41:25.248
I made GS 14.

41:25.282 --> 41:27.283
Wow.
That's all right, man.

41:27.318 --> 41:28.985
Next stop,
Washington, D.C.,

41:29.019 --> 41:30.619
sitting behind a desk,

41:30.654 --> 41:32.488
papers piled so high,
you can't see over them.

41:32.522 --> 41:34.857
Hey, better you than me, buddy.

41:34.891 --> 41:36.992
Seriously,
congratulations, buddy.

41:37.027 --> 41:38.160
Thanks.

41:38.195 --> 41:41.263
Steve said you might
have something for us.

41:41.298 --> 41:42.431
Yeah, maybe.

41:42.466 --> 41:44.967
You guys are going
to have to tell me.

41:45.002 --> 41:47.670
Remember my pal Tim Roberts?

41:47.704 --> 41:49.372
APD detective?

41:49.406 --> 41:51.607
Yeah, well, he's working
on a murder case,

41:51.642 --> 41:54.143
and the victim's
a 34-year-old male Caucasian

41:54.177 --> 41:56.344
by the name of Gale Boetticher.

41:56.379 --> 41:58.880
One night last month,
Boetticher opens the door--

41:58.915 --> 42:01.582
Bam, take a bullet to the face

42:01.617 --> 42:04.518
from a person
or persons unknown.

42:04.552 --> 42:08.655
Now, this Gale Boetticher is
a bona fide chemistry genius.

42:08.690 --> 42:11.625
I mean, he's got degrees
up the wazoo, right?

42:11.659 --> 42:16.296
And, uh, as you might expect,
he's a nerd's nerd.

42:16.331 --> 42:19.266
Vegan, sandals and socks
kind of guy.

42:19.301 --> 42:24.638
As it turns out, he's also
an A-number 1 meth cook.

42:24.673 --> 42:26.474
And what caught my eye

42:26.508 --> 42:30.045
is, uh, his specialty
product's blue.

42:30.079 --> 42:32.214
So what are you thinking?

42:32.248 --> 42:33.849
This is your Heisenberg?

42:33.883 --> 42:37.753
No. What I think we got here
is, uh, ahem,

42:37.787 --> 42:39.755
Heisenberg's former cook

42:39.789 --> 42:43.526
and maybe a line
on Heisenberg himself.

42:45.129 --> 42:46.496
Anyway, uh, lo and behold,

42:46.530 --> 42:50.666
amidst all the hippie-dippie
nonsense, ahem,

42:50.701 --> 42:52.268
I find this.

42:52.303 --> 42:56.706
Now, this here
I do a little Google-fu,

42:56.740 --> 42:59.208
and I-- I realize
it's a parts number

42:59.243 --> 43:01.978
specifically for this baby.

43:02.012 --> 43:04.547
Now, that there
is a high-volume

43:04.581 --> 43:08.785
HEPA industrial
air filtration system.

43:08.819 --> 43:11.088
That's a $300,000 gadget.

43:11.122 --> 43:13.624
Perfect
for a pharmaceutical plant

43:13.658 --> 43:15.325
or microchip factory

43:15.360 --> 43:20.097
or maybe the biggest meth lab
north of the border.

43:22.400 --> 43:24.201
Okay.

43:24.236 --> 43:27.038
So this little dingus here
is manufactured

43:27.072 --> 43:29.874
by a big
international concern--

43:29.908 --> 43:32.143
Madrigal Electromotive.

43:32.177 --> 43:34.612
I call their Houston office,
and eventually I get through

43:34.647 --> 43:36.948
to the nicest little
20-year-old temp.

43:36.982 --> 43:39.216
I use some of the Schrader
sweet talk on her.

43:39.251 --> 43:41.218
Before you know it,
she's pulling files for me.

43:41.252 --> 43:42.586
Turns out six months ago,

43:42.620 --> 43:44.654
one of these systems
was shipped to a depot

43:44.689 --> 43:46.690
right here in ABQ.

43:46.724 --> 43:48.992
Who signed for it?

43:49.026 --> 43:50.560
Gale Boetticher.

43:50.594 --> 43:53.697
So I asked my new girlfriend
who paid for it,

43:53.732 --> 43:55.967
and she says "Nobody."

43:57.570 --> 43:58.870
They have no record

43:58.905 --> 44:01.774
that anybody actually
paid for this thing.

44:01.808 --> 44:05.545
So I go back and push more,
and before you know it,

44:05.579 --> 44:07.781
uh, the temp's gone,
there's no forwarding address,

44:07.815 --> 44:09.950
and I'm talking to some
snot-nose corporate lawyer

44:09.984 --> 44:11.818
who's asking me
for my badge number.

44:11.853 --> 44:14.455
Brick wall.

44:14.489 --> 44:18.692
So I take a peek
into Madrigal Electromotive.

44:18.727 --> 44:21.695
Now, Madrigal is based
in Hanover, Germany,

44:21.730 --> 44:24.498
but they're what they call
highly diversified--

44:24.533 --> 44:27.268
Industrial equipment,
global shipping,

44:27.303 --> 44:28.536
major construction,

44:28.571 --> 44:32.975
and a tiny little foothold
in American fast food,

44:33.009 --> 44:35.612
specifically a local chain--

44:35.646 --> 44:37.714
Pollos Hermanos.

44:40.919 --> 44:42.686
Okay. So what, right?

44:42.720 --> 44:43.954
Boetticher's dead.

44:43.989 --> 44:46.157
I got no line on who's
been bankrolling him

44:46.191 --> 44:48.860
or where his lab was.

44:48.894 --> 44:51.128
The whole thing's
a snipe hunt, right?

44:51.163 --> 44:55.433
But now I get this crazy idea,

44:55.467 --> 44:58.002
and I can't shake it.

44:58.036 --> 45:01.838
I mean, I-- I stay up nights
staring at the ceiling

45:01.873 --> 45:03.039
and trying to make sense of it.

45:03.074 --> 45:04.274
It's that napkin.

45:04.308 --> 45:05.942
Remember I told you
Boetticher's vegan, right?

45:05.976 --> 45:06.976
I mean, we're talking
this guy makes

45:07.010 --> 45:09.445
his own fermented lentil bread

45:09.479 --> 45:12.048
or whatever the hell that is.

45:12.082 --> 45:16.485
What's a vegan doing
in a fried chicken joint?

45:20.491 --> 45:22.526
Maybe he's meeting somebody.

45:22.560 --> 45:24.495
Like who?

45:24.530 --> 45:27.031
Well, like maybe...

45:28.367 --> 45:30.702
this guy.

45:34.774 --> 45:37.508
I mean, what do we know
about Gustavo Fring?

45:37.542 --> 45:40.711
Huh? This whole "friend
of law enforcement" thing, eh,

45:40.745 --> 45:44.113
could be a case of keep your friends
close but your enemies closer.

45:44.148 --> 45:46.349
He's got the money
to finance this operation.

45:46.383 --> 45:47.750
Maybe he's got
the connections, too.

45:47.784 --> 45:50.385
Maybe, just maybe...

45:50.420 --> 45:51.953
he's our guy.

45:56.093 --> 45:57.693
Hank, no offense,

45:57.728 --> 45:59.929
but I think
you're really reaching.

45:59.963 --> 46:03.700
If your guy
had his meeting at KFC,

46:03.734 --> 46:05.536
you wouldn't immediately assume

46:05.570 --> 46:07.605
that he's sitting down
with Colonel Sanders.

46:07.639 --> 46:09.573
You know, I-- ahem--

46:09.608 --> 46:12.677
I couldn't agree more, guys.

46:12.711 --> 46:17.448
Gustavo Fring, blue meth,
you know...

46:17.482 --> 46:22.387
The whole thing
is off-the-map nuts.

46:22.421 --> 46:24.990
I ought to be wearing
a tinfoil hat, you know?

46:27.159 --> 46:28.426
Except...

46:30.162 --> 46:33.765
I can't seem to wrap my mind
around this one little thing,

46:33.799 --> 46:35.634
and that is...

46:35.668 --> 46:38.571
what are Gustavo Fring's
fingerprints...

46:40.140 --> 46:42.274
doing in Gale Boetticher's
apartment?
