09:15.068 --> 09:16.551
THEY WERE '63 ONLY --

09:16.551 --> 09:19.344

FIBERGLASS INSTEAD OF STEEL.

09:19.344 --> 09:20.827

HOW MUCH IS IT?

09:50.586 --> 09:52.724

Chris:
IT'S BETTER THAN $72,000.

09:56.310 --> 09:57.655

YOU WERE GONNA THINK.

-HOW DO YOU FIGURE $50,000?
-IT'S PRETTY EASY.

10:07.068 --> 10:09.275

THAN WHAT HE SAID.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.310

HE'S AT $70,000.

10:11.310 --> 10:12.827

TO $60,000.

10:12.827 --> 10:14.448

GOTTEN OVER THE RAW DEAL

10:26.413 --> 10:27.827

WITHOUT THE WHITE,

IN THIS CASE,
WE'RE GONNA HAVE THREE COLORS.

25:01.034 --> 25:03.172
WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE ORANGE
FROM THE BASE COAT,

25:03.172 --> 25:05.344
TAN, AND WHITE.

25:05.344 --> 25:07.551
SEE, IN THE '70s,
FOLKS LIKED THEIR STRIPES

25:07.551 --> 25:11.137
THE SAME WAY TEXANS LIKE THEIR
CHILI -- BEEFY AND CHUNKY.

25:11.137 --> 25:13.896
SO WE'RE GONNA GO A GAS MONKEY
TAKE ON THE WIDE-STRIPE PACKAGE

25:13.896 --> 25:16.103
THAT CAME STOCK ON THE SCOUT.

25:16.103 --> 25:19.482
THE WAY YOU CREATE STRIPES
IS BY MASKING OFF THE AREA

25:19.482 --> 25:22.551
YOU WANT TO STRIPE
WITH FINE-LINE TAPE.

25:22.551 --> 25:25.793
THE MAIN VISIBLE LAYER WILL BE
THE WHITE, SO THAT MEANS

25:25.793 --> 25:28.068
I'LL START BY PAINTING
THE OLIVE TAN

25:28.068 --> 25:30.379
OVER THE MASKED
ORANGE BASE COAT.

25:30.379 --> 25:32.310
THE NEXT LAYER WILL BE THE WHITE

25:32.310 --> 25:34.482
SINCE IT'LL BE
THE MOST PROMINENT.

25:34.482 --> 25:36.931
AFTER THAT,
WE PEEL BACK ALL THE TAPE

25:36.931 --> 25:38.827
TO FIND
A FRESH BATCH OF STRIPES.

25:38.827 --> 25:41.172
-HOPEFULLY NOTHING'S WRONG.
-BUT BEFORE WE CLEAR COAT,

25:41.172 --> 25:43.103
WE NEED RICHARD
TO GIVE US THE THUMBS-UP.

25:43.103 --> 25:45.103
Richard: OH, YOU BETTER
LOOK SCARED. DADDY'S COMING.

25:45.103 --> 25:46.827
I LOVE IT WHEN YOU
CALL YOURSELF "DADDY."

25:46.827 --> 25:48.344
LOOK AT THE OTHER SIDE.
IT'S UNTAPED.

25:48.344 --> 25:53.379
AM I SUPPOSED TO LIKE IT?
THAT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

25:53.379 --> 25:55.137
THAT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD,
THAT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD,

25:55.137 --> 25:57.758
THAT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.
THAT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

25:57.758 --> 25:59.793
I MEAN,
THE OVERALL DESIGN'S FINE.

25:59.793 --> 26:01.862
WE WANTED THE
STOCK PATTERN, RIGHT?

26:01.862 --> 26:03.482
YEAH.
MORE OR LESS.

26:03.482 --> 26:06.758
BUT THE LINES THEMSELVES
LOOK LIKE CRAP.

26:06.758 --> 26:10.689
YOU DO IT. I DON'T EVEN...
WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

26:10.689 --> 26:12.586
ARE YOU THAT UPSET?

26:12.586 --> 26:14.379
NO, IT'S JUST, UH...

26:14.379 --> 26:16.620
WHEN RICHARD
SEES IT ON TV...

26:16.620 --> 26:18.172
OH, WELL,
I DON'T GIVE A [BLEEP].

26:18.172 --> 26:20.068
SO THAT BASTARD
CAME IN THERE, RIGHT?

26:20.068 --> 26:23.034
WE KNEW WE HAD SOME FLAWS IN THE
PAINT THAT WERE GOING TO ADDRESS

26:23.034 --> 26:24.965
BEFORE IT EVER
GOT TO CLEAR COAT.

26:24.965 --> 26:26.724
AND OF COURSE,
HE COMES IN THERE,

26:26.724 --> 26:29.068
AND THE FIRST THING
HE FINDS IS ALL THE FLAWS.

26:29.068 --> 26:30.965
I MEAN, LOOK AT ALL
THESE LITTLE CHIPS.

26:30.965 --> 26:33.310
Mike: THE THING THAT'S GOT
RICHARD'S PANTIES IN A BUNCH

26:33.310 --> 26:36.586
ARE THESE TINY, LITTLE DOTS
ON THE EDGE OF THE STRIPES,

26:36.586 --> 26:39.103
BUT WE'RE GONNA
SMOOTH THOSE OUT ANYWAYS.

26:39.103 --> 26:41.793
NOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO MAKE
DOUBLE SURE THAT ALL THESE LINES

26:41.793 --> 26:43.517
IN THE STRIPE PACKAGE
ARE FLAWLESS,

26:43.517 --> 26:45.310
OR ELSE RICHARD'S
GONNA COME IN HERE

26:45.310 --> 26:46.793

ALL OVER AGAIN.
