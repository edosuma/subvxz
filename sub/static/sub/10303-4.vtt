01:27.400 --> 01:31.109
I'm so glad you're
my physics lab partner, Breezy.

01:32.320 --> 01:36.438
Sure, I could've gotten an easy A
teaming up with a Korean kid...

01:38.000 --> 01:40.468
...but I prefer a challenge.

01:40.720 --> 01:42.870
Oh, Bud.

01:43.120 --> 01:46.954
I've watched you every day
in Quantum Mechanics.

01:47.200 --> 01:50.431
I just love the way
you glide your fingers sensuously...

01:50.640 --> 01:53.552
...over your Texas Instruments.

01:56.480 --> 01:57.913
Take me.

02:25.920 --> 02:28.150
Another dream, Dad?

02:29.960 --> 02:32.315
Another dream, son.

02:32.640 --> 02:35.916
- Why didn't you stop me?
- There's a game on.

02:37.080 --> 02:39.036
Sorry about that, Dad.

02:39.280 --> 02:41.999
I haven't slept much because
I'm studying for a scholarship.

02:42.240 --> 02:46.518
The test is tomorrow and if I ace it,
I'll get to study at Oxford.

02:47.160 --> 02:49.151
You have heard of Oxford?

02:49.560 --> 02:52.711
Heard of it?
Hell, I've been selling them for years.

02:54.480 --> 02:56.516
Actually, Dad,
Oxford is a university in Eng...

02:56.760 --> 02:59.035
Cheerleader routine, son.

02:59.600 --> 03:02.114
Fine, but I gotta study,
so can you try to keep it down?

03:02.360 --> 03:04.157
Gotcha.

03:04.720 --> 03:07.075
Cut to the left. Cut to the left.

03:07.320 --> 03:09.834
Now. Go for the end zone.

03:10.080 --> 03:11.877
I thought you were watching
cheerleaders.

03:12.120 --> 03:15.271
I am. Damn cameraman's
shooting their faces.

03:16.600 --> 03:18.591
Dad, remember, the scholarship?

03:18.840 --> 03:22.116
Son, remember, your room?
Why don't you study upstairs?

03:22.840 --> 03:25.115
Because Kelly's
blasting music in her room.

03:25.360 --> 03:28.432
Some band she wants to see,
Otitis Media.

03:28.840 --> 03:30.990
- What a stupid name.
- Otitis Media?

03:31.200 --> 03:33.191
No, Kelly.

03:35.200 --> 03:39.716
Never liked that name.
Always wanted to call her Spike.

03:40.400 --> 03:43.551
Of course, I wanted a son.
Never got one. Damn wife.

03:45.280 --> 03:46.952
Dad, can you stop
"seniling" around...

03:47.160 --> 03:49.549
...and turn this game off
long enough for me to study?

03:49.800 --> 03:52.360
This game is important.
The Bears are playing the Rams.

03:52.560 --> 03:55.154
If you lose to the Rams,
you get thrown out of the league.

04:02.920 --> 04:04.433
Why am I fighting?

04:04.680 --> 04:07.274
I know where the quietest place
in the world is.

04:23.840 --> 04:26.274
Bud, I've come to make love to you.

04:30.280 --> 04:35.638
I want you to rub my tootsies and
then show me something in a size six.

04:38.720 --> 04:41.109
I only carry a nine.

05:00.680 --> 05:03.911
This is so exciting for me,
mon cheri.

05:04.800 --> 05:09.271
Now, if you'll allow me
to nibble on your love grapes.

05:10.880 --> 05:14.839
I found this in back, if you want to
make the one you got jealous.

05:19.960 --> 05:23.032
- Who are you?
- Name's Griff. I work here.

05:23.320 --> 05:26.517
That's funny. Dad never told me
he hired another guy.

05:26.760 --> 05:29.877
- And who are you?
- Bud. Al Bundy's my father.

05:30.160 --> 05:33.118
That's funny.
He never told me he had a son.

05:34.120 --> 05:35.348
- Daughter?
- Nope.

05:35.560 --> 05:37.630
- Wife?
- Not living.

05:39.480 --> 05:43.268
- Four touchdowns in one game?
- Oh, hell, yeah.

05:43.520 --> 05:46.432
That's why I told him to go home.
I couldn't stand it anymore.

05:46.680 --> 05:49.478
Look, this is not what you think.

05:49.840 --> 05:53.230
I've been studying so hard for this
scholarship that I tend to fall asleep.

05:53.480 --> 05:56.517
If you're looking for some
peace and quiet, I won't bother you.

05:58.040 --> 06:01.077
I'm just here because
I don't have any other place to go.

06:10.920 --> 06:13.354
I used to have a place to go.

06:15.160 --> 06:19.676
Then I got divorced.
Now I got two places I don't go.

06:22.080 --> 06:25.436
Yup, divorced.

06:25.680 --> 06:27.796
She got the house,
the car, the money.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.639
I got the right to remain silent.

06:31.800 --> 06:34.109
But that's fair, I guess.

06:36.360 --> 06:38.078
Of course, what really ticks me off...

06:38.280 --> 06:41.078
...is that even Michael Jackson's
married and I'm not.

06:48.480 --> 06:50.311
But I'm not bitter.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.596
You go on back to your studying.

07:09.360 --> 07:10.998
Dad, I've got to study, all right?

07:11.240 --> 07:13.549
Go ahead. Who's stopping you?

07:14.160 --> 07:16.071
Get that, will you?

07:17.840 --> 07:20.718
Why do I suddenly feel
I'm in the presence of great evil?

07:20.960 --> 07:22.439
Hi, Mom.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.715
Hi, Bud.
Look, I can't talk long, honey.

07:25.920 --> 07:28.070
I just called to give you
a Grandma update.

07:28.320 --> 07:29.548
The doctors have told us...

07:29.760 --> 07:32.433
...that she can take those
long walks in the woods again...

07:32.640 --> 07:35.871
...as long as she wears
the orange drop cloth.

07:36.480 --> 07:39.870
Oh, yes, and Aunt Sadie is
making you the cutest sweater.

07:40.120 --> 07:41.997
You know,
her eye has stopped leaking now.

07:42.200 --> 07:44.156
Of course, her ear has started to.

07:46.320 --> 07:47.912
And we're hoping, with any luck...

07:48.120 --> 07:51.271
...they'll be able to
separate the twins next Friday.

07:51.520 --> 07:53.078
So, honey, what's going on there?

07:54.080 --> 07:55.354
There's this scholarship...

07:55.640 --> 07:58.393
Time's up. Gotta go.

08:07.440 --> 08:09.556
Daddy, guess what I just heard.

08:09.880 --> 08:13.793
Otitis Media is in concert right here
and I have to go.

08:14.040 --> 08:16.554
Please?
It's only a couple hundred dollars.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.711
Kelly, at least have the decency...

08:18.960 --> 08:21.394
...to take the headphones off
when I say no to you.

08:22.960 --> 08:26.953
Please, Dad, I have to go.
It's the greatest band in the world.

08:27.240 --> 08:31.518
Kelly, will you be quiet?
Your brother's trying to study.

08:32.159 --> 08:35.470
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

08:36.080 --> 08:40.278
Guess what. We're going to have
a new addition to our family.

08:40.679 --> 08:44.559
Well, shouldn't you be sitting on it,
waiting for it to hatch?

08:50.480 --> 08:53.199
Mrs. D'Arcy,
you're gonna have a baby?

08:53.440 --> 08:57.319
Better. We're gonna have a teenager.

08:58.440 --> 09:02.228
Well, then, can I strongly recommend
that you have a caesarean?

09:06.320 --> 09:07.548
No, Kelly.

09:07.800 --> 09:12.271
My niece, Amber, is coming from
Los Angeles to stay with us for a while.

09:12.520 --> 09:17.514
Bud, you met Amber six years ago
when she was 13. You remember?

09:19.440 --> 09:21.431
Well, I think she's beautiful.

09:21.680 --> 09:24.877
Yeah, but you think Jefferson works.

09:27.320 --> 09:28.594
I don't know about you...

09:28.840 --> 09:32.719
...but when I sweat and don't enjoy it,
I call it work.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.992
Anyway, Amber's parents think
she's been hanging out...

09:36.200 --> 09:39.192
...with the wrong crowd in L.A.,
getting a little too wild...

09:39.400 --> 09:42.949
...so I'm going to teach her
traditional Midwestern values.

09:43.200 --> 09:47.751
What? Wearing print dresses, serving
lots of tuna casserole and getting fat?

09:49.440 --> 09:50.998
Exactly.

09:51.240 --> 09:55.392
And while she's here, you, Al Bundy,
are not to offend her in any way.

09:55.640 --> 09:59.155
And that includes going outside
with your shirt off.

10:00.160 --> 10:02.720
Or bending over
and showing us that vertical smile...

10:02.920 --> 10:04.990
...we've come to know and love.

10:09.280 --> 10:12.750
If you don't like it, why don't you put
her on the other side of your house?

10:13.000 --> 10:15.355
Because our second bedroom
is the only place for her.

10:16.280 --> 10:20.319
Excuse me, Marcie,
but that's my billiard room.

10:21.160 --> 10:22.991
Not anymore.

10:23.840 --> 10:26.195
Even my little solarium
where I sit by the window...

10:26.440 --> 10:28.670
...and watch people go to work?

10:32.480 --> 10:36.837
I wave to you each morning
until you've rounded the corner.

10:37.080 --> 10:40.197
You'd take that joy away from me?

10:40.600 --> 10:41.828
What am I gonna do?

10:42.840 --> 10:44.717
Get a job?

10:46.400 --> 10:48.868
No, really. What am I gonna do?

10:49.960 --> 10:51.598
It's Amber's room.

10:51.880 --> 10:55.953
Oh, this is just great.
Now everybody's got a room but me.

10:56.200 --> 11:00.352
Kelly's got a room,
Bud's got a room, Al's got...

11:00.600 --> 11:02.238
So now I'm no better off than Al?

11:07.320 --> 11:10.392
Hold it up, people! Enough!

11:10.840 --> 11:12.558
I'm gonna put a stop
to this right now.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.637
He's got a gun!

11:17.800 --> 11:19.392
Now, here's what we're gonna do.

11:19.640 --> 11:21.551
This is all the money I have.

11:21.840 --> 11:24.308
So, Dad, here, take some money
and go to the nudie bar.

11:25.320 --> 11:28.153
- The game's not over.
- And the Rams tak e the field.

11:28.400 --> 11:30.470
Okay, it's over.

11:32.320 --> 11:34.072
Thanks, son.

11:34.640 --> 11:36.995
Kelly, go get yourself
some concert tickets.

11:37.240 --> 11:39.629
Thank you, Bud.
If you weren't my brother, I would...

11:39.840 --> 11:43.469
You'd be surrendering your body for
an ice cream and a pony ride. Get out.

11:45.640 --> 11:51.078
Mrs. D'Arcy, take Amber to
the groomers. I mean, the movies.

11:57.720 --> 12:01.110
- Bud?
- Yeah?

12:02.360 --> 12:04.715
Could I go to the nudie bar with Al?

12:17.320 --> 12:20.995
Oh, finally, some quiet.

12:21.560 --> 12:23.471
It's just you and me now, Buck boy.

12:24.560 --> 12:27.757
I've seen porno films
that start lik e this.

12:39.520 --> 12:40.748
What is it?

12:42.440 --> 12:45.477
Hi, I'm Marcie's niece, Amber.

12:50.640 --> 12:54.792
- You're Amber?
- Yeah. I'm hiding from my aunt.

12:55.040 --> 12:58.589
Do you mind if I get out of these
sticky clothes and take a shower?

13:05.920 --> 13:11.677
So now that you've showered
and lotioned up...

13:13.320 --> 13:15.754
...and eaten a banana in front of me...

13:22.120 --> 13:24.873
...what brings you to Chicago?

13:25.200 --> 13:27.953
Aunt Marcie sent me
first-class plane tickets.

13:28.280 --> 13:30.475
- It must have been a great trip.
- It was.

13:30.920 --> 13:33.229
I cashed them in and hitchhiked.

13:34.960 --> 13:39.954
But believe me, hitching across
the country is not as safe as it sounds.

13:40.800 --> 13:42.677
I mean,
there were some people so freaky...

13:42.920 --> 13:45.559
...I almost didn't
get in the car with them.

13:46.360 --> 13:49.511
For instance, there was this one guy
who picked me up outside El Paso.

13:49.720 --> 13:51.915
Not that I mind sharing...

14:17.800 --> 14:20.155
I guess I should have dressed up.

14:20.480 --> 14:24.917
Hey, it's my fantasy.
You'll wear what I want you to wear.

14:41.800 --> 14:44.758
Again, it's my fantasy.

14:48.920 --> 14:50.035
So I said:

14:50.240 --> 14:54.233
"There must be something besides
my blouse you can use as an oil rag."

14:59.160 --> 15:01.230
Look at the time. I gotta go.

15:01.440 --> 15:04.318
If Aunt Marcie caught me here,
there's no telling what she'd do.

15:04.600 --> 15:06.238
But I'm sure it would be boring.

15:08.800 --> 15:11.553
- See you.
- See you.

15:19.200 --> 15:22.749
Cute girl.
What happened, wrong house?

15:24.600 --> 15:28.149
No, Dad, that was Mrs. D'Arcy's niece.
That was Amber.

15:28.400 --> 15:30.072
Marcie's niece?

15:30.320 --> 15:33.437
Must be from the unfeathered
side of the family.

15:34.560 --> 15:37.279
Dad, think she and I could ever...?

15:37.520 --> 15:39.954
Not a chance, son.

15:40.920 --> 15:43.832
- Thanks, Dad.
- Hey, what's a father for?

15:44.040 --> 15:46.793
Looking on the bright side,
Amber's living right next door.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.833
So sooner or later,
you'll probably get to see her naked.

15:50.560 --> 15:53.233
But whatever you do,
don't look at Marcie.

15:53.840 --> 15:57.435
I did one time and was clinically dead
for an hour and a half.

16:13.560 --> 16:16.074
Damn leaky rubber woman.

16:23.320 --> 16:25.754
Bud, it's me, Amber.

16:27.160 --> 16:29.720
Amber?
What are you doing over here?

16:29.960 --> 16:31.552
Well, I had to go somewhere.

16:31.800 --> 16:37.830
And since Aunt Marcie said never ever,
ever to come over here, here I am.

16:42.320 --> 16:47.394
I hurt my neck climbing over the fence.
Could you rub it?

16:51.200 --> 16:53.270
With my hands?

16:55.200 --> 16:57.031
Surprise me.

16:58.800 --> 17:01.997
Wait a minute.
I know what's happening.

17:02.240 --> 17:05.311
I'm dreaming again. Yeah, that's it.

17:05.560 --> 17:09.348
As soon as I touch her,
I'll be in school without my pants on.

17:10.440 --> 17:13.829
Come on, Bud, rub me. Hurry.

17:19.640 --> 17:21.835
Hey, this is great.

17:22.280 --> 17:25.954
Gee, I hope I don't wak e up
with the whole family staring at me...

17:27.880 --> 17:29.552
...again.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.197
Your hands feel so strong...

17:35.160 --> 17:37.799
...especially the right one.

17:41.320 --> 17:43.151
Do you work out?

17:44.200 --> 17:45.758
Kind of.

17:48.240 --> 17:53.189
Odd. I don't normally
mak e fun of myself in my dreams.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.879
Still, this can't be real.

17:57.120 --> 18:00.271
Oh, well, there's only one way
to know for sure.

18:02.280 --> 18:06.956
Amber, want to have sex?

18:07.520 --> 18:08.794
Sure.

18:17.840 --> 18:21.992
Yup, it's a dream, all right,
but who cares.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.436
It was my first dream
where the girl actually said yes.

18:52.280 --> 18:53.759
Hi, Bud.

18:55.440 --> 18:56.953
Amber?

18:57.520 --> 18:59.431
It's 3 a.m.

19:00.200 --> 19:02.555
Look, I've gotta go...

19:02.800 --> 19:07.078
...but I just want you to know that you're
by far the best lover I've ever had.

19:11.920 --> 19:14.195
It's like you really know your body.

19:19.080 --> 19:22.277
Yeah, well, you can
chalk that up to experience.

19:23.960 --> 19:25.951
I mean, with women.

19:26.640 --> 19:30.030
Not that I lay here at night
and feel myself up.

19:30.440 --> 19:33.671
Because that would be
really pathetic and dumb.

19:45.520 --> 19:49.308
- Well, I better get back.
- Amber?

19:50.240 --> 19:51.275
Can I see you tomorrow?

20:04.080 --> 20:05.593
We'll see.

20:09.240 --> 20:10.912
Kelly?

20:14.360 --> 20:15.952
Next window.

20:20.480 --> 20:22.152
I can't believe it.

20:22.360 --> 20:25.113
After I went out of my way to be quiet
so you could study...

20:25.320 --> 20:27.390
...you didn't even
get the scholarship.

20:28.120 --> 20:31.078
Now you'll be here forever,
like your mother.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.797
Like me.

20:34.360 --> 20:37.670
- Don't forget me, Daddy.
- And like Spike here.

20:39.800 --> 20:42.360
You were supposed to be
the Bundy that made it.

20:42.640 --> 20:45.632
Yeah. The Great White Pope.

20:47.920 --> 20:50.514
Don't help Daddy, pumpkin.

20:56.080 --> 20:58.389
Why do you think
we even had a second child?

20:58.640 --> 21:02.235
We knew that nothing
was gonna happen here.

21:03.480 --> 21:05.038
I guess I should be punished, then.

21:05.280 --> 21:08.272
Yes, you should. But how?

21:08.520 --> 21:12.593
I say we put him in a sack
and throw him off the Sears Tower.

21:13.360 --> 21:15.920
Where the hell am
I gonna get a sack?

21:18.240 --> 21:21.676
Dad, whatever you do,
just don't send me to my room...

21:21.880 --> 21:24.235
...especially for a whole week.

21:25.760 --> 21:26.988
That would kill me.

21:29.720 --> 21:31.551
You go to your room.

21:37.720 --> 21:39.950
For one week.

21:41.280 --> 21:44.113
You're a cruel but fair man.
