Cover for me in case dorkface comes back.

00:12.390 --> 00:13.000
- Where are you going?
- For a cigarette.

00:13.960 --> 00:17.000
- You had one 15 minutes ago.
- 45 minutes.

00:17.790 --> 00:19.000
Why don't you get
one of those patches or that gum?

00:19.920 --> 00:24.000
- What do you think I'm chewing?
- Then maybe you should just quit.

00:24.320 --> 00:26.000
Look, just cover for me, OK?

00:26.480 --> 00:29.000
Tell her I got a stomach bug or somethin'.

Thank you.

Jane, come on. You're gonna get in trouble.

02:24.759 --> 02:26.000
Jane?

Hey, Jane.

Brody, Jane L.

10:36.279 --> 10:39.000
We've got the pathologist's work
but the crime scene hasn't been checked yet.

10:39.799 --> 10:42.000
- Let me see what you got.
- Your name?

10:42.679 --> 10:45.000
Special Agent Fox Mulder.

10:45.480 --> 10:46.000
Workin' the late shift?

10:46.919 --> 10:49.000
- Yeah. Somebody's got to.
- You need to sign that.

11:20.879 --> 11:22.000
I'm all set here.

11:22.919 --> 11:25.000
- Finished?
- Yeah. Thanks.

11:26.440 --> 11:27.000
No problem.

11:56.800 --> 11:57.000
Agent Mulder!

12:00.800 --> 12:02.000
I'm glad I caught ya.

12:02.600 --> 12:06.000
- Who are you?
- Detective Thomas. Ray Thomas.

12:06.440 --> 12:09.000
I'm the one who e-mailed
the pictures to your office.

12:10.800 --> 12:14.000
Officer Robbins said you'd come down
to take a look at the forensic evidence.

12:14.240 --> 12:15.000
That's right.

12:15.679 --> 12:19.000
So, does that mean you've found something?
Something worth lookin' into?

12:19.919 --> 12:21.000
- I'm afraid not.
- No?

12:22.200 --> 12:24.000
Nothing to recommend
my further involvement.

12:24.759 --> 12:26.000
How do you explain the woman?

12:26.519 --> 12:32.000
She walks into a bathroom. A minute later,
she turns up... Look, you saw the pictures.

12:32.800 --> 12:33.000
I saw 'em.

12:33.360 --> 12:39.000
I was told you were part of somethin' called
the X-Files. You'd look into stuff like this.

12:39.120 --> 12:43.000
If there's really nothin' to this, why come
all the way here in the middle of the night?

12:43.720 --> 12:47.000
I'm just doin' my job, Detective, same as you.

13:45.519 --> 13:48.000
- Oh, you are home.
- Yeah. What are you doin' here?

13:48.639 --> 13:51.000
I was tryin' to reach you.
Your phone's off the hook.

13:51.240 --> 13:53.000
I needed some sleep.

13:53.480 --> 13:56.000
Is that why you're takin'
the garbage out at 4am?

13:56.720 --> 14:00.000
- What do you want, Agent Mulder?
- I want some answers.

14:01.320 --> 14:03.000
- Concerning?
- The death of a postal worker...

14:04.390 --> 14:07.000
...that somebody has gone
to great lengths to keep unexplained.

14:07.600 --> 14:11.000
These photos were sent by a detective
who thought I might have a fresh take on it.

14:11.440 --> 14:15.000
But when I went to retrieve them from my
e-mail, somebody had hollowed out the files.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
- Then where'd you get 'em?
- From his partner.

14:18.720 --> 14:19.000
When?

14:19.440 --> 14:23.000
After he finished questioning me
about the detective's death.

14:23.240 --> 14:27.000
- What are you talking about?
- He was killed, execution-style.

14:27.800 --> 14:30.000
His body was found near the precinct
two hours ago.

14:30.159 --> 14:35.000
Possibly by the same person who forged
my name to gain access to the forensics lab.

14:35.480 --> 14:38.000
- What do you want from me?
- I'd like your help on this, sir.

14:38.240 --> 14:40.000
What about Agent Scully?

14:40.399 --> 14:42.000
Agent Scully's in the hospital.

14:42.639 --> 14:44.000
Has something happened?

14:44.200 --> 14:46.000
She's undergoing some imaging tests.

14:47.390 --> 14:52.000
Her oncologist was concerned that,
uh, her tumour may be metastasising.

14:55.879 --> 14:59.000
Anyway, I'd like you
to take a look at those photos, please.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.000
Yeah, first thing in the morning.

15:01.519 --> 15:04.000
You want me to, uh,
dump this on my way out?

15:04.600 --> 15:06.000
No, I got it.

15:13.159 --> 15:14.000
{y:i}(sighs)

15:34.200 --> 15:36.000
{y:i}(tyres screeching)

15:44.720 --> 15:46.000
Was it you?

15:46.399 --> 15:49.000
Did you pull the trigger
or did you have him do it for you?

15:49.399 --> 15:52.000
- I'm not here to answer your questions.
- You murdered him!

15:53.390 --> 15:56.000
- You killed an officer of the law.
- Keep your voice down...

15:56.519 --> 16:00.000
...unless you want your neighbours to know
the hours and the company you keep.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.000
I won't be a party to murder.

16:05.919 --> 16:09.000
I wouldn't get too comfortable
on your moral high ground, Mr Skinner.

16:09.759 --> 16:13.000
This only happened
because you left yourjob unfinished.

16:13.360 --> 16:16.000
I handled him just like I've handled
everything else you've asked me to do.

16:16.879 --> 16:18.000
I've followed your instructions.

16:18.559 --> 16:22.000
You failed to neutralise
a potentially compromising situation.

16:22.559 --> 16:24.000
You didn't have to kill him.

16:25.480 --> 16:27.000
He didn't have to die.

16:30.759 --> 16:33.000
You're in no position to question
the terms of our arrangement.

16:33.960 --> 16:36.000
Then we have no arrangement.

16:38.679 --> 16:41.000
You'll find it's not that easy
to walk away from.

16:41.360 --> 16:42.000
No?

16:43.390 --> 16:46.000
A man digs a hole, he risks falling into it.

17:21.519 --> 17:23.000
{y:i}(phone ringing)

17:33.319 --> 17:35.000
- Skinner.
- Her body's gone, sir.

17:35.720 --> 17:38.000
- What are you talking about?
- The postal worker.

17:38.559 --> 17:43.000
It was stolen from the morgue along with any
evidence that might explain how she died.

17:43.400 --> 17:45.000
{y:i}- Slow down.
- I'm sorry, I can't.

17:45.400 --> 17:47.000
I'm playing catch-up here.

17:47.680 --> 17:51.000
The man who impersonated me
at the forensics lab replaced a blood sample.

17:51.759 --> 17:52.000
How do you know?

17:52.599 --> 17:57.000
The blood sample in the police forensics lab
is B-positive, as is the postal worker's.

17:57.559 --> 18:01.000
{y:i}She suffered from a mild form of anaemia
{y:i}characterised by folic acid deficiency.

18:01.880 --> 18:06.000
{y:i}The blood sample at the police forensics lab
{y:i}has a normal folic serum level.

18:06.160 --> 18:07.000
Any suspects?

18:07.119 --> 18:11.000
No, but I have a place to start.
The gun that killed Detective Thomas...

18:11.790 --> 18:13.000
...Ballistics has identified it
as a Sig Sauer P-228.

18:16.839 --> 18:22.000
{y:i}Ballistics are running comps on all weapons
{y:i}registered to federal agents and local officers.

18:30.790 --> 18:30.680
Sir?

18:31.880 --> 18:34.000
- Let me know what they find.
- I will.

18:38.839 --> 18:40.000
{y:i}(ringing)

18:41.920 --> 18:44.000
- Yes.
- You can't do this!

18:44.359 --> 18:46.000
You sound agitated, Mr Skinner.

18:46.119 --> 18:47.000
- Was it my gun?
- Your gun?

18:47.960 --> 18:49.000
Used to kill the detective.

18:50.160 --> 18:53.000
If it was, you'd want to report it
to the police immediately.

18:53.359 --> 18:56.000
- Don't think I won't.
- Then why are you calling me?

18:59.440 --> 19:02.000
You realised you'd be admitting
to obstruction ofjustice...

19:02.519 --> 19:05.000
...criminal conspiracy
and destruction of evidence?

19:05.400 --> 19:07.000
{y:i}The consequences could be very serious...

19:07.720 --> 19:12.000
...even if you were able to persuade the
authorities that you didn't kill the detective.

19:12.559 --> 19:14.000
What did I cover up?

19:15.920 --> 19:19.000
I think the less you know, the better,
under the circumstances.

19:19.599 --> 19:22.000
I need to know what that man died for.

19:22.279 --> 19:24.000
{y:i}He died for you, Mr Skinner.

19:25.480 --> 19:27.000
{y:i}He died so you could have what you wanted.

19:28.160 --> 19:32.000
A cure for Agent Scully.
Isn't that what you want?

19:32.160 --> 19:34.000
Agent Scully is in the hospital.

19:34.359 --> 19:37.000
If you can do anything for her,
I want it done now.

19:37.279 --> 19:39.000
I'm aware of Agent Scully's progress.

19:39.720 --> 19:44.000
If anything happens to her, I will expose you.
I'll turn state's evidence.

19:45.400 --> 19:47.000
{y:i}I don't care what happens to me.

19:48.480 --> 19:52.000
Agent Scully stands to live
a long and healthy life.

19:52.480 --> 19:55.000
I would hope the same for you, Mr Skinner.

19:56.640 --> 19:58.000
{y:i}(dial tone)

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
Right in here.

20:27.160 --> 20:32.000
The police said we could use the bathroom.
But the truth is, no one wants to use it...

20:32.119 --> 20:34.000
...not after what happened yesterday.

20:38.359 --> 20:41.000
Do you mind my asking
what you're looking for?

20:52.759 --> 20:53.000
I need a hammer.

21:17.599 --> 21:20.000
Any reason you're not running this
through the FBI lab?

21:20.839 --> 21:24.000
This evidence is classified.
We've had some controversy over security.

21:24.839 --> 21:27.000
- I'd appreciate your discretion.
- Certainly.

21:27.359 --> 21:32.000
- Can you tell what kind of bees made that?
- I might be able to give you an answer.

21:32.519 --> 21:35.000
If I told you the bees that made that
could be lethal, would that help?

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
Any kind of bee can be lethal,
provided you get stung by enough of them.

21:39.519 --> 21:42.000
Even Africanised honeybees, killer bees...

21:42.240 --> 21:44.000
...have the same venom
as European honeybees.

21:44.519 --> 21:47.000
It's just that they attack in swarms.

21:47.480 --> 21:49.000
Ah, you may be in luck.

21:49.799 --> 21:51.000
- What is it?
- Royal jelly.

21:51.720 --> 21:55.000
A highly nutritious secretion
of the honeybee's pharyngeal gland.

21:55.519 --> 21:58.000
It's fed to the very young larvae in a colony.

21:58.240 --> 22:00.000
Here, see for yourself.

22:02.400 --> 22:03.000
Is that gonna hatch?

22:03.599 --> 22:07.000
Once they pupate, I should be able
to give you some definitive answers.

22:07.359 --> 22:10.000
The minute you learn something,
I'd appreciate a call.

22:10.359 --> 22:12.000
Is this related to that other case?

22:13.799 --> 22:16.000
- If you don't mind my asking.
- What other case?

22:16.160 --> 22:19.000
I got a call from an agent about six months
ago, asking me about killer bees.

22:19.839 --> 22:22.000
- Who was it?
- Uh, name was Fox Mulder.

22:22.119 --> 22:24.000
I wondered if there's any connection.

22:24.640 --> 22:25.000
No.

22:26.519 --> 22:28.000
Anyway, I'll call you.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.000
Sir?

23:15.880 --> 23:18.000
You looking for me?

23:18.359 --> 23:20.000
I was just writing you a note.

23:22.799 --> 23:26.000
- Where have you been?
- First Nations Bank of Virginia.

23:29.680 --> 23:32.000
- What am I looking at?
- The bank is adjacent...

23:32.319 --> 23:34.000
...to where the detective was killed.

23:34.400 --> 23:37.000
A surveillance camera caught this.
That man is Detective Thomas.

23:37.799 --> 23:42.000
This man in the baseball hat was identified
by the officer on duty at the forensics lab...

23:42.480 --> 23:44.000
...as Agent Mulder.

23:45.359 --> 23:49.000
- Can you get a usable image off this?
- I'm gonna deliver it to Special Photo now.

23:49.240 --> 23:51.000
What did you want to talk to me about?

23:51.880 --> 23:54.000
You were writing me a note.

23:54.160 --> 23:57.000
I was, uh, I was
just checking on your progress.

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
Ms Covarrubias? I'm Walter Skinner,
an assistant director at the FBI.

24:10.559 --> 24:12.000
- Yes?
{y:i}- I was hoping you could help me.

24:12.519 --> 24:16.000
I understand Agent Fox Mulder has been
in contact with you about a project.

24:16.400 --> 24:17.000
{y:i}A project?

24:18.390 --> 24:21.000
An agricultural project
involving bees or bee husbandry.

24:21.640 --> 24:25.000
Yes, but I wasn't able
to give him any information.

24:25.160 --> 24:26.000
Why was that?

24:26.640 --> 24:29.000
{y:i}The project he cited
{y:i}turned up no viable evidence.

24:29.759 --> 24:32.000
- Evidence of what?
- Beehives or bee husbandry.

24:35.480 --> 24:37.000
What if I said I had access to that evidence?

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
You have access to these bees?

24:39.799 --> 24:42.000
I may, soon. Very soon.

25:07.359 --> 25:09.000
{y:i}(faint buzzing)

25:23.640 --> 25:26.000
{y:i}(screaming, groaning)

25:54.720 --> 25:57.000
- Agent Mulder.
- Thanks for gettin' here so quickly.

25:57.519 --> 26:00.000
- What is it?
- A break. Maybe even a lead.

26:01.839 --> 26:05.000
I wanted you to look at this body
before somebody stole it.

26:05.400 --> 26:07.000
See these pocks and blisters?

26:07.790 --> 26:10.000
They're the same as we saw
on the deceased postal worker.

26:10.640 --> 26:12.000
- Symptoms of what?
- Smallpox.

26:12.960 --> 26:16.000
The first reported case in over seven years.

26:17.319 --> 26:18.000
Smallpox?

26:18.319 --> 26:22.000
It's an especially virulent strain
caused by a mutated variola virus.

26:22.480 --> 26:28.000
Caused how? How could he have contracted
a disease that doesn't even exist anymore?

26:28.200 --> 26:29.000
From these.

26:33.440 --> 26:34.000
What are they?

26:34.359 --> 26:39.000
Bee stingers and venom sacs recovered
from the victim's face, arm and neck.

26:39.200 --> 26:41.000
He was stung by bees carrying smallpox?

26:41.400 --> 26:46.000
He was a forensic entomologist. I consulted
him months ago about a similar fatality.

26:46.359 --> 26:49.000
- You've seen this before.
- But I've never had any evidence until now.

26:49.759 --> 26:52.000
I think that's what somebody's
trying to prevent.

26:52.440 --> 26:54.000
- Why?
- I can only guess.

26:54.759 --> 26:58.000
I think somebody is trying
to engineer a method of delivery...

26:58.359 --> 27:03.000
...for a disease that has killed more people
throughout history than any other contagion.

27:03.880 --> 27:07.000
- I can suggest an appropriate response...
- Can they be stopped?

27:07.200 --> 27:12.000
We don't know who they are. And we won't
until we know the identity of that shooter.

27:12.960 --> 27:14.000
- How close are you?
- Very.

27:14.400 --> 27:17.000
I've got a photo tech
working on the surveillance video.

27:17.359 --> 27:20.000
He can show me something soon.
I told him you'd authorise the overtime.

27:20.839 --> 27:21.000
Of course.

27:21.799 --> 27:23.000
I'm gonna go over there right now.

27:24.680 --> 27:26.000
Tell me what you find.

27:43.200 --> 27:45.000
(man) Just grabbin' a cup of coffee.

27:46.880 --> 27:48.000
Misty Nagatta?

27:48.880 --> 27:50.000
My name is Walter Skinner.

27:50.519 --> 27:55.000
I was just going. We only get a ten-minute
break, and my supervisor's pretty strict.

27:55.160 --> 27:57.000
I need to talk to you, Misty.

27:59.319 --> 28:02.000
- About your coworker.
- If this is about Jane...

28:02.599 --> 28:05.000
...I already told the police everything I know.

28:05.240 --> 28:06.000
Everything?

28:11.799 --> 28:15.000
- I don't wanna lose my job.
- You're not gonna lose anything.

28:15.319 --> 28:18.000
I'm asking you to cooperate
in a criminal investigation.

28:18.160 --> 28:20.000
Jane? What do you mean?

28:23.240 --> 28:26.000
- Jane's death may not have been an accident.
- What?

28:36.920 --> 28:38.000
She was my best friend.

28:40.519 --> 28:41.000
I'm sorry.

28:42.480 --> 28:45.000
We worked it out
so that our vacations overlapped.

28:46.440 --> 28:48.000
We were going to Palm Beach.

28:50.359 --> 28:54.000
Both of us were tryin' to lose weight
so we could buy new bathing suits.

29:01.440 --> 29:03.000
The men who came here...

29:03.519 --> 29:07.000
...they said if I talked to anyone,
I'd lose my job.

29:07.279 --> 29:08.000
Did these men say who they were?

29:09.390 --> 29:12.000
No, and I didn't ask.
They just wanted the package.

29:13.559 --> 29:14.000
What package?

29:14.960 --> 29:19.000
Damaged packages are routed here
for inspection before they get reshipped.

29:19.960 --> 29:24.000
The place where these packages are kept,
how close is it to the rest room?

29:25.359 --> 29:29.000
It's just the next door down the hall.
They've got a storage room.

29:30.319 --> 29:34.000
The damaged package that they wanted,
do you remember where it was being sent?

29:34.680 --> 29:36.000
No. Not offhand.

29:36.400 --> 29:40.000
- Is there any way of finding out?
- I can look up the tracking number.

29:42.599 --> 29:45.000
That would be a big help to me, Misty.

29:46.799 --> 29:48.000
And maybe to Jane.

29:51.160 --> 29:55.000
We went through every inch of that tape
to find the best angle for identification.

29:55.359 --> 29:58.000
It was videotape, shot at a distance,
under extreme low light.

29:58.759 --> 30:00.000
So this is the best you could do?

30:01.790 --> 30:03.000
It's better than I thought it would be.
I tried every trick.

30:03.880 --> 30:08.000
I'm not trying to be difficult. It's just that this
is very important to me. I need to be sure.

30:09.519 --> 30:11.000
{y:i}(tapping on keyboard)

30:30.319 --> 30:33.000
I need you to print out
a hard copy of that for me.

30:36.960 --> 30:39.000
This is the last remaining specimen.

30:41.000 --> 30:45.000
The bees from the scientist's house
have been contained and destroyed.

30:45.319 --> 30:47.000
And the body?

30:50.640 --> 30:52.000
It also has been sanitised.

30:53.680 --> 30:55.000
How did this happen?

30:57.759 --> 30:59.000
The details are unimportant.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
Details are everything.

31:02.759 --> 31:06.000
Much more important
than your vague assurances.

31:07.160 --> 31:10.000
You'll have to trust my assurance
that all breaches have been handled.

31:10.640 --> 31:12.000
Handled by whom?

31:13.400 --> 31:15.000
I have a man in place.

31:15.960 --> 31:18.000
A man with no other choice but to succeed.

31:19.279 --> 31:23.000
And what assurance can you give us
that he can be trusted?

31:23.599 --> 31:26.000
We can't risk even the slightest exposure.

31:26.240 --> 31:28.000
He has nothing to expose...

31:29.390 --> 31:30.000
...except his own duplicity.

31:31.599 --> 31:35.000
Should we assume that the trial run
is proceeding as planned?

31:43.440 --> 31:45.000
It's already begun.

32:04.440 --> 32:06.000
{y:i}(bee buzzing)

32:10.440 --> 32:12.000
- Hey, it's my turn.
- No, it isn't.

32:18.480 --> 32:20.000
Ow! Ow!

32:21.839 --> 32:23.000
{y:i}(buzzing)

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
Mrs Kemper! Billy got stung by a bee!

32:29.880 --> 32:31.000
Mrs Kemper!

32:32.279 --> 32:35.000
{y:i}(bees buzzing/children screaming)

32:35.559 --> 32:38.000
Everyone, inside! Everybody, inside!

32:38.480 --> 32:40.000
Inside! Move it, move it!

32:42.400 --> 32:44.000
{y:i}(screaming continues)

32:50.440 --> 32:52.000
Slow down!

32:52.559 --> 32:54.000
Oh, my God! David!

32:54.799 --> 32:56.000
David, get up!

32:56.680 --> 32:57.000
Quick!

32:59.790 --> 33:00.000
Come on! Run!

33:05.880 --> 33:07.000
{y:i}(screaming)

33:23.480 --> 33:25.000
{y:i}(machines beeping)

33:37.559 --> 33:38.000
Dr Linzer?

33:41.790 --> 33:44.000
My name's Walter Skinner. You're overseeing
the treatment of these children?

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
Yes.

33:46.240 --> 33:49.000
- You'll wanna hear me out.
- I'm in the middle of it.

33:49.240 --> 33:51.000
If you're treating them
for bee stings, you're wrong.

33:51.759 --> 33:54.000
- What should I be treating them for?
- Smallpox.

33:54.279 --> 33:55.000
Is this ajoke?

33:55.200 --> 33:59.000
Every child in this town who hasn't already
been infected needs to be vaccinated.

33:59.200 --> 34:02.000
We don't vaccinate against smallpox
because there is no smallpox.

34:02.759 --> 34:04.000
Run tests if you don't believe me.

34:04.759 --> 34:08.000
I don't need to. Smallpox
has an eight-day incubation period...

34:08.790 --> 34:10.000
...and these kids were stung a few hours ago.

34:10.518 --> 34:12.000
How do you reconcile that?

34:12.239 --> 34:13.000
I can't.

34:18.400 --> 34:19.000
Excuse me.

34:19.639 --> 34:23.000
Let me know when you've got an answer.
In the meantime, I've got things to do.

34:23.840 --> 34:26.000
- Doctor!
- Mr Skinner?

34:28.599 --> 34:29.000
How do you know who I am?

34:30.389 --> 34:33.000
Because you contacted me.
I'm Marita Covarrubias.

34:36.119 --> 34:37.000
What are you doing here?

34:37.599 --> 34:40.000
Your call about those bees
prompted me to make inquiries.

34:40.840 --> 34:41.000
Into what?

34:41.960 --> 34:47.000
Seven packages that were sent from Canada
to a PO box in Payson, South Carolina.

34:48.760 --> 34:52.000
I came here to find out
what was in those packages.

34:57.159 --> 35:00.000
- You're a little late to do anything about it.
- So are you, apparently.

35:02.280 --> 35:04.000
What brought you here?

35:06.719 --> 35:12.000
You came to me for information, but you still
haven't told me what you know about this.

35:12.760 --> 35:16.000
My office has to answer to
the Secretary-General of the United Nations.

35:16.519 --> 35:20.000
This is a very serious matter.
I need to know what's going on.

35:25.519 --> 35:27.000
I think it's some kind of experiment.

35:27.440 --> 35:30.000
- An experiment?
- Using bees as carriers.

35:31.440 --> 35:34.000
That's what was in those packages?

35:41.840 --> 35:44.000
- Have you told Agent Mulder this?
- Not yet.

35:44.280 --> 35:46.000
- Why not?
- I can't.

35:46.440 --> 35:47.000
Why?

35:51.519 --> 35:55.000
- Are you involved in this, Mr Skinner?
- I didn't...

35:56.119 --> 35:59.000
- No, I'm not involved.
- Then what are you doing here?

35:59.559 --> 36:01.000
- What aren't you telling me?
- Nothing.

36:01.960 --> 36:07.000
If you know who's behind this, you have to
come forward, Mr Skinner. No one else can.

36:37.790 --> 36:39.000
Put the gun down
and move away from the desk.

36:39.320 --> 36:42.000
- I was just calling...
- I said put the gun down!

36:48.639 --> 36:50.000
{y:i}(sighs)

36:50.800 --> 36:52.000
You don't understand.

36:52.199 --> 36:54.000
No. I do now.

36:54.719 --> 36:56.000
No, you don't.

36:56.440 --> 36:59.000
- Is that the gun you shot the detective with?
- No!

36:59.239 --> 37:00.000
You shot an innocent man.

37:00.960 --> 37:03.000
- I didn't kill him!
- You're a liar!

37:04.119 --> 37:06.000
You've been working with the Smoking Man.

37:06.320 --> 37:09.000
You knew when he killed my father
and when they took Scully.

37:09.119 --> 37:10.000
- Listen to me.
- I've heard enough.

37:10.880 --> 37:14.000
He set me up!
He stole my gun and then he put it back!

37:15.119 --> 37:17.000
So the police are probably on their way.

37:17.119 --> 37:21.000
- I don't believe you.
- Look at my desk drawer, Agent Mulder.

37:21.559 --> 37:23.000
Look at it!

37:24.199 --> 37:26.000
Why would I force my own lock?

37:31.159 --> 37:32.000
If I lied to you...

37:36.920 --> 37:39.000
I have lied to you,
and I won't make excuses for those lies.

37:39.760 --> 37:41.000
But there's a reason that I did what I did.

37:42.790 --> 37:45.000
One that I think you're in
a unique position to understand.

37:48.159 --> 37:52.000
I advised you against a certain
course of action some time ago...

37:52.920 --> 37:55.000
...concerning Agent Scully.

37:58.280 --> 38:00.000
I didn't follow my own advice.

38:04.440 --> 38:05.000
Give me the gun.

38:21.519 --> 38:25.000
How soon will you know if that's
the weapon that killed Detective Thomas?

38:25.760 --> 38:29.000
As long as it takes to put one of these slugs
into a scope and run a comp.

38:30.400 --> 38:33.000
This is the slug we recovered
from the detective's body.

38:35.880 --> 38:38.000
You see this stria here and here?

38:39.790 --> 38:43.000
They're rifling patterns,
imprinted from the barrel of the same gun.

38:43.440 --> 38:45.000
So this is definitely the murder weapon?

38:45.960 --> 38:49.000
If I were called to testify,
I'd say without a doubt.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
So where'd you find it?

38:56.159 --> 38:59.000
In a sewer grate, around the corner
from the crime scene.

39:00.400 --> 39:03.000
- Hm.
- Sometimes you get lucky.

39:03.320 --> 39:06.000
- And sometimes you don't, right?
- What do you mean?

39:08.800 --> 39:11.000
The serial number - it's been filed clean off.

39:13.639 --> 39:18.000
Now, unless Forensics pulled a print,
this gun's virtually untraceable.

39:39.920 --> 39:41.000
(Skinner) Leave it off.

39:44.639 --> 39:46.000
I'm starting to get used to the dark.

39:46.599 --> 39:49.000
- Is this part of our deal?
- We never had a deal.

39:49.559 --> 39:50.000
No?

39:50.400 --> 39:54.000
Agent Scully is dying
and you haven't done a damn thing about it.

39:56.639 --> 40:00.000
- You think that's funny?
- Just enjoying the irony, Mr Skinner.

40:00.599 --> 40:05.000
Only yesterday you said you wouldn't
be party to murder. And now here you are.

40:07.440 --> 40:11.000
Yours isn't the first gun
I've had pointed in my face, Mr Skinner.

40:13.559 --> 40:15.000
I'm not afraid to die.

40:16.760 --> 40:19.000
But if you kill me,
you'll also kill Agent Scully.

40:19.320 --> 40:22.000
You have no intention of saving her.
You never did.

40:23.360 --> 40:24.000
Are you certain?

40:26.360 --> 40:30.000
I saved her life once before
when I had her returned to Agent Mulder.

40:30.519 --> 40:32.000
I may save her life again.

40:34.790 --> 40:37.000
But you'll never know
if you pull the trigger, will you?

40:38.840 --> 40:40.000
{y:i}(phone ringing)

40:44.960 --> 40:48.000
Now, unless you intend to kill me,
I'd like to answer my phone.

40:48.679 --> 40:50.000
{y:i}(ringing continues)

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
{y:i}(ringing continues)

41:17.199 --> 41:18.000
{y:i}(ringing)

41:27.390 --> 41:28.000
Yes?

41:31.320 --> 41:33.000
He was just here.

41:33.800 --> 41:36.000
He threatened to kill me.

41:38.400 --> 41:41.000
I'm sure Mulder will be contacting you.

41:41.639 --> 41:44.000
He'll want to know if Skinner's
seen all there is to see.

41:47.440 --> 41:49.000
I'll tell him what you want me to tell him.

41:56.880 --> 41:58.000
Tell him what he wants to hear.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
