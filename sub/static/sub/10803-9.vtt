13:35.231 --> 13:37.774
When the Ferengi Council
learns of your actions,

13:37.942 --> 13:41.361
they will consider this an act of war.

13:42.530 --> 13:45.448
DaiMon, clearly there has been
some misunderstanding.

13:45.616 --> 13:47.242
I think it would be in all our interests

13:47.409 --> 13:50.328
if you were to come aboard
and we discuss this situation.

13:50.496 --> 13:53.873
I see no reason to trust you,
human.

13:55.167 --> 13:58.711
In that case, we'll be on our way.

13:59.505 --> 14:03.842
I'll relay your position
to your government, if you wish,

14:04.009 --> 14:05.885
in case you are unable
to complete your repairs

14:06.053 --> 14:08.471
and you remain stranded.

14:10.182 --> 14:11.224
Perhaps,

14:11.934 --> 14:15.603
it would be better
to discuss the situation. Hmm.

14:23.821 --> 14:28.157
We detected what appeared to be
a Federation signal buoy.

14:28.325 --> 14:32.662
When we approached it,
it emitted a massive verteron pulse.

14:32.830 --> 14:34.831
Our warp drive, our sensors,

14:34.999 --> 14:37.584
our communications systems
were all disabled.

14:38.294 --> 14:43.965
We assumed we were the victims
of a new Federation weapon.

14:44.133 --> 14:46.467
The Federation
established this Corridor

14:46.635 --> 14:50.054
to ensure a safe access
through this sector.

14:50.222 --> 14:52.181
We have nothing to gain
by mining it.

14:52.349 --> 14:55.810
Whatever happened to your ship may
not have been an isolated incident.

14:55.978 --> 14:59.147
A Federation medical transport
was recently lost in that Corridor.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.858
We passed a Federation ship
several days ago.

15:02.026 --> 15:04.485
It did not appear to be
in any distress.

15:04.653 --> 15:07.155
Can you give us an idea
of its heading?

15:07.990 --> 15:10.241
It is possible
that information was recorded

15:10.409 --> 15:12.702
in our sensor logs, commander.

15:12.870 --> 15:16.873
Unfortunately, my entire crew
was occupied with our repairs.

15:17.041 --> 15:19.334
I don't think there will be time
to search our records.

15:21.629 --> 15:22.754
DaiMon,

15:22.922 --> 15:28.384
if we assigned an engineering team
to assist you with your repair efforts,

15:28.552 --> 15:31.012
would that give you time
to retrieve your logs?

15:32.056 --> 15:34.807
I believe it would, captain.

15:38.854 --> 15:41.564

15:41.732 --> 15:48.571

17:01.353 --> 17:04.063
I suppose
I must accept that possibility.

17:04.231 --> 17:06.649
It may be that Spot lacks

17:38.140 --> 17:41.350
This procedure will only increase
the conversion level by .8 percent.

17:41.518 --> 17:46.689
- I know, but it could be just enough.
- Enough?

17:47.483 --> 17:51.319
I just received this
from Commander Kaplan subspace.

17:51.820 --> 17:58.534
"La Forge, I got the Intrepid's power
conversion levels up to 97.1 percent.

Maybe you should try cleaning
your plasma grid once in a while."

the nerve of that guy?

We perform maintenance
on the plasma grid at regular intervals.

We have traced
the Fleming's most likely course.

It now appears that the vessel may
have come to an unfortunate end.

18:36.490 --> 18:39.784
- What's the origin of this debris field?
- Unknown, sir.

18:39.952 --> 18:42.787
It does not appear in any of
the Federation charts of the Corridor.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.872
Could it be
what's left of the Fleming?

18:45.040 --> 18:46.833
It is a possibility.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.043
The debris consists primarily
of duranium

18:49.211 --> 18:52.630
and poly-composite fragments
which suggest a ship.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.757
Furthermore,
the field contains sufficient mass

18:54.925 --> 18:57.093
to account for the Fleming.

18:57.678 --> 19:00.596
All right, let's take a closer look.
Maybe we can find something

19:00.764 --> 19:03.641
that will give us
a more positive identification.

19:11.108 --> 19:14.193
approximately
3.5 meters in diameter.

Could be a ship's log recorder
or a probe casing.

19:17.239 --> 19:21.450
I do not believe so.
It is emitting an unusual signal.

You have made
a very serious accusation.

20:28.894 --> 20:30.811
I want you to explain it.

20:30.979 --> 20:32.521
Captain, according to our research,

20:32.689 --> 20:36.234
warp fields cause a dangerous
reaction in this region of space.

20:36.401 --> 20:38.402
SEROVA:
Our planet is already being affected.

20:38.570 --> 20:41.656
We have measured large gravitational
shifts throughout our system.

20:41.823 --> 20:45.952
If something isn't done,
our planet will become uninhabitable.

20:46.119 --> 20:48.037
Captain,
I've heard this theory before.

20:48.205 --> 20:50.623
Their research was evaluated
by the Federation Science Council

20:50.791 --> 20:51.999
a few years ago.

20:52.167 --> 20:53.501
But frankly, it didn't hold up.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.461
SEROVA:
That research was only preliminary.

20:55.629 --> 20:57.838
Our original analysis
was incomplete.

20:58.006 --> 21:00.132
If you wanted us
to review your research,

21:00.300 --> 21:02.635
you should have made a request
through the Science Council.

21:02.803 --> 21:06.347
Their resources are limited.
It would have taken over a year

21:06.515 --> 21:09.600
before they dispatched a science ship
to come and evaluate our work.

21:09.768 --> 21:12.186
We were not willing
to wait any longer.

21:12.354 --> 21:15.731
We knew that if we disabled
enough ships, Starfleet would come.

21:15.899 --> 21:18.109
Then at least
we would be able to present our case.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.319
That's how you rationalized
these attacks?

21:21.154 --> 21:24.240
Neither you nor the Ferengi
suffered any casualties, commander.

21:24.408 --> 21:26.659
The actual damage to your vessels
was negligible.

21:26.827 --> 21:28.619
We dispersed verteron probes
in the Corridor

21:28.787 --> 21:31.205
merely to disable warp-driven ships.

21:31.373 --> 21:33.374
- Nothing more.
- You can call it whatever you like.

21:33.542 --> 21:36.752
The fact remains,
you deliberately disguised your probes.

21:36.920 --> 21:38.421
You made them look like
signal markers.

21:38.588 --> 21:42.383
You hid them in the debris field.
You mined the Corridor.

21:43.719 --> 21:45.177
Mr. La Forge,
how long do you estimate

21:45.345 --> 21:47.179
it will take to restore the engines?

21:47.347 --> 21:50.141
Their verteron pulse
overloaded our field coils, captain.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.143
It will take at least 36 hours
to get underway.

21:52.311 --> 21:55.646
I know precisely
how our pulse affected your field coils.

21:55.814 --> 21:59.942
With my help, your ship
could be operational in 1 0 hours,

22:00.110 --> 22:02.278
provided you agree
to review our research.

22:03.196 --> 22:04.905
Because of the seriousness
of your claim,

22:05.073 --> 22:06.949
I am willing to listen to your case.

22:07.117 --> 22:08.284
But let there be no mistake.

22:08.452 --> 22:11.037
Our priority here
is the recovery of the Fleming.

22:11.204 --> 22:13.247
Now, l expect you to help us
restore our engines

22:13.415 --> 22:16.625
and deactivate all of
the remaining probes in the Corridor.

22:16.793 --> 22:19.587
If you do not,
you will both be taken to the brig

22:19.755 --> 22:21.714
and from there,
to the nearest starbase,

22:21.882 --> 22:24.342
where you will answer charges
for what you have done.

22:24.760 --> 22:27.428
My sister and I do not wish
to impede your rescue process.

22:27.596 --> 22:30.097
Rabal, don't. The probes
are the only leverage we have.

22:30.265 --> 22:32.099
- If we--
- Serova.

22:33.935 --> 22:35.895
We will do as you ask, captain.

22:36.063 --> 22:39.273
- But please, reexamine our data.
- We will.

22:39.441 --> 22:41.692
It is part of our job
to retain an open mind,

22:41.860 --> 22:43.444
even under these circumstances.

22:43.612 --> 22:45.112
Mr. La Forge,
take them to Engineering,

22:45.280 --> 22:47.698
- get the core back online.
- Yes, sir.

22:47.866 --> 22:49.825
Mr. Data,
I want you to review their research.

22:49.993 --> 22:52.787
I'd like your report
as soon as possible.

23:06.176 --> 23:08.719
There. Shields have been restored.

23:08.887 --> 23:10.679
You will be able
to re-engage your engines

23:10.847 --> 23:12.515
in approximately eight hours.

23:12.682 --> 23:15.476
You know,
even when we get the engines online,

23:15.644 --> 23:19.063
it's gonna take at least a week
to recalibrate them properly.

23:19.231 --> 23:21.482
I'm sorry
you've been inconvenienced.

23:21.650 --> 23:24.110
But that's all it is, an inconvenience.

23:24.277 --> 23:25.653
Our concerns
are much more important

23:25.821 --> 23:28.030
than the condition of your engines.

23:28.198 --> 23:30.825
What if the Fleming had been
transporting perishable supplies?

23:30.992 --> 23:32.201
Or was on an emergency mission?

23:32.369 --> 23:34.036
Your plan
might have cost a lot of lives.

23:34.204 --> 23:36.038
That didn't happen, commander.

23:36.206 --> 23:38.874
And saving lives
is precisely what we're trying to do.

23:39.042 --> 23:41.043
You have a very interesting way
of going about it.

23:41.211 --> 23:43.421
There's no point
in trying to talk to you.

23:43.588 --> 23:46.298
You've already decided not to listen.

23:49.219 --> 23:54.557
Commander, I know my sister
can be somewhat, uh, aggravating.

23:54.724 --> 23:57.435
- I'd have to agree with that.
- But please, try to understand.

23:57.602 --> 24:00.062
She believes profoundly
in this cause.

24:00.230 --> 24:04.066
She has sworn to dedicate her life
to exposing the dangers of warp drive.

24:04.234 --> 24:06.861
Warp drive has been around
for three centuries.

24:07.028 --> 24:08.821
It's a proven technology.

24:08.989 --> 24:12.366
And you sound just like I did,
about four years ago.

24:12.534 --> 24:15.035
- You didn't believe her either?
- No.

24:15.203 --> 24:18.414
What l didn't realize
was just how brilliant my sister is.

24:18.582 --> 24:20.332
It took two years of study for me

24:20.500 --> 24:23.544
to even grasp the principles
behind her theoretical models.

24:24.045 --> 24:25.754
They're that sophisticated.

24:25.922 --> 24:28.299
Well, our Commander Data
is no slouch.

24:28.467 --> 24:31.677
If there's anything there, he'll find it.

24:31.845 --> 24:33.053
RABAL:
Well, I hope so.

24:33.221 --> 24:34.680
Because
once we persuade Starfleet

24:34.848 --> 24:36.599
to stop warp travel
through the Corridor,

24:36.766 --> 24:38.434
we're gonna have
to convince our own people

24:38.602 --> 24:40.603
to give up warp drive completely.

24:40.770 --> 24:44.106
Hekaras II is the only inhabited world
in this region.

24:44.274 --> 24:46.192
Without warp drive,
you'd be completely isolated

24:46.359 --> 24:48.360
from the rest of the Federation.

24:48.528 --> 24:51.405
Are you really willing
to take that step?

24:51.573 --> 24:52.698
Yes.

24:52.866 --> 24:54.742
And if you were in my position,

24:54.910 --> 24:57.786
I hope you'd be willing
to do the same thing.

25:06.630 --> 25:08.464
Serova and Rabal believe
that there are regions

25:08.632 --> 25:11.467
of potential subspace instability
within the Corridor.

25:11.635 --> 25:13.219
They believe that if these regions

25:13.386 --> 25:16.972
continue to be exposed
to warp field energy, they will rupture.

25:17.140 --> 25:20.309
Subspace will extrude
into normal space, forming a rift.

25:20.477 --> 25:22.478
Like pacing up and down
on the same piece of carpet.

25:22.646 --> 25:23.979
Eventually, you wear it out.

25:24.147 --> 25:26.065
That analogy
is essentially correct, sir.

25:26.233 --> 25:28.901
- Can this theory be proven?
DATA: Not at this time, sir.

25:29.069 --> 25:31.362
There is insufficient evidence
to do so.

25:31.530 --> 25:34.323
In order to determine
whether or not a rift will form,

25:34.491 --> 25:37.076
a region must be exposed

25:41.039 --> 25:44.124
Commander, we believe
the warp field effect is cumulative.

25:44.292 --> 25:46.669
Each starship that passes through
the Corridor at warp

25:46.836 --> 25:49.588
brings us one step closer
to forming a rift.

25:49.756 --> 25:51.507
I agree that is a possibility.

25:52.509 --> 25:55.928
Captain, l suggest
we ask the Federation Science Council

25:56.096 --> 25:58.264
to send a research vessel
to this area.

25:58.431 --> 26:01.433
A more detailed investigation
will resolve many of our questions.

26:01.601 --> 26:06.188
That's your response?
More research, more delays.

anything different.

their subspace systems are out.

you're giving us.

Serova, what are you trying to do?

27:25.602 --> 27:29.271
They wanted proof.
I'm going to give it to them.

I'm sorry.

Captain, the Hekaran ship's engines
are beginning to overload.

I believe Serova is attempting
to create a warp core breach.

It's incredible.

28:18.571 --> 28:20.614
Mr. Data, what's your analysis?

28:20.782 --> 28:24.159
The event is approximately
0.1 light years in diameter

28:24.327 --> 28:28.580
and it is emitting extremely
high levels of tetryon radiation.

28:28.748 --> 28:33.127

to survive in there?

29:13.001 --> 29:14.418
If we maintain our current position,

29:14.586 --> 29:16.712
our shields should provide
sufficient protection.

29:16.880 --> 29:19.214
What about the Fleming?
How long can they survive in there?

29:19.382 --> 29:22.217
The waves are even more intense
within the rift.

29:22.385 --> 29:26.513
I estimate her shields will fail
in approximately 12 hours.

Can we risk going in there
to get them out?

29:28.892 --> 29:29.933
Not at warp, commander.

29:30.101 --> 29:32.728
According to these readings,
the rift is in a state of instability,

29:32.896 --> 29:35.397
which would make it extremely
sensitive to warp field energies.

29:35.565 --> 29:38.066
If we go in at warp,
we might expand it even further.

29:39.611 --> 29:40.819
I don't think we have a choice.

Where we can safely use
our warp engines?

It's a subspace instability
outside the rift.

That should not be possible.

a field-enhanced scan of this sector.

31:01.276 --> 31:03.944
I'd like to get a closer look at this.

31:04.112 --> 31:07.155
We'd better tell the captain we don't
know how to get to the Fleming.

31:07.323 --> 31:09.825
I am not certain that is true.

31:10.326 --> 31:12.703
I believe l have an idea.

31:17.125 --> 31:20.711
- I suggest we coast into the rift.
- Coast?

31:20.879 --> 31:25.340
We can initiate a brief, high-intensity
warp pulse from our current position.

31:25.508 --> 31:29.052
We should be able to attain
sufficient velocity to enter the rift,

31:29.220 --> 31:31.513
beam the crew off the Fleming
and exit,

31:31.681 --> 31:33.682
without using our warp engines.

31:33.850 --> 31:36.852
All right, let's say we initiate
a full-power warp pulse.

31:37.020 --> 31:39.104
How much time do we need
to drop out of warp?

31:39.814 --> 31:41.857
If we field-saturate the nacelles,

31:42.025 --> 31:45.360
we should be able to sustain warp
speed for approximately two minutes.

31:46.070 --> 31:49.615
That doesn't give us much time.
And it could get pretty rough in there.

31:50.199 --> 31:51.742
Our timing will be critical.

31:52.201 --> 31:53.911
Begin your calculations, Mr. Data.

31:54.078 --> 31:56.580
- We'll go as soon as you're ready.
- Aye, sir.

32:02.545 --> 32:06.924
I believe the maximum saturation level
should be 1 8.3 percent.

32:07.091 --> 32:09.384
All right. With these parameters,

32:09.552 --> 32:13.513
we should be able to maintain warp
speed for two minutes, eight seconds.

32:13.681 --> 32:15.390
I don't think
we can get any more than that.

32:15.558 --> 32:16.600
I agree.

32:16.768 --> 32:18.560
But based on the size of the rift,

32:18.728 --> 32:21.480
it should give us sufficient time
to complete the rescue.

32:21.648 --> 32:26.735

32:27.070 --> 32:30.739

- Beg your pardon?

32:31.574 --> 32:32.824
How did we miss the connection

32:32.992 --> 32:36.745
between warp drive
and the formation of the rift?

32:36.913 --> 32:39.748
Between the two of us, we've logged
thousands of hours on these engines.

32:39.916 --> 32:43.043
We're supposed to be
warp field experts.

32:43.378 --> 32:44.711
We certainly were wrong this time.

32:44.879 --> 32:48.256
Technically, Geordi,
we were not wrong.

32:48.424 --> 32:52.135
Serova's theories rested on
assumptions which were unprovable.

32:52.303 --> 32:54.930
Seems to me, she managed
to prove them pretty conclusively.

32:55.807 --> 32:59.559
By using methods any reputable
scientist would never employ.

32:59.727 --> 33:04.940
Yeah. She was willing to die
in order to make her point.

33:06.150 --> 33:08.276
Should have listened to her
more closely, Data.

33:10.363 --> 33:14.324
We reviewed Serova's research
to the best of our abilities.

33:14.617 --> 33:17.119
And we were prepared
to continue studying the problem.

33:17.286 --> 33:18.787
But that was unsatisfactory.

33:18.955 --> 33:21.081
I can remember times
when I was a little stubborn,

33:21.249 --> 33:23.875
trying to get people to believe me
when I didn't have enough proof.

33:24.043 --> 33:26.628
I do not believe you would have
resorted to such extremes.

33:26.796 --> 33:31.425
But she had to,
just to get us to listen.

33:33.761 --> 33:35.804
Why was I so resistant?

33:36.764 --> 33:38.432
Perhaps because
her aggressive methods

33:38.599 --> 33:40.976
created an adversarial situation.

33:42.020 --> 33:43.854
Yeah.

33:44.480 --> 33:49.026
Maybe I was taking
the whole thing personally.

38:35.604 --> 38:37.522
to the EM variants
of the distortion wave,

38:37.690 --> 38:39.941
when the next one hits,
we'll be pulled along with it.

38:41.068 --> 38:43.862
We could ride it through the rift
and then break away once we're clear.

38:44.030 --> 38:46.531
That is, if we survive the ride.

38:46.699 --> 38:47.949
Is everyone off the Fleming?

38:48.617 --> 38:50.452
The last of the crew
has beamed aboard, sir.

38:51.662 --> 38:54.414
All right, Mr. La Forge.
Get us out of here.

38:54.832 --> 38:58.460
Yes, sir. Phase-matching
the deflector shields now.

38:58.627 --> 39:01.713
The next distortion wave
will impact in 14 seconds.

39:01.881 --> 39:04.132
Matching phases.

39:04.300 --> 39:08.428
Prepare to engage the deflector shield
on my mark.

39:08.596 --> 39:10.638
DATA:
Ten seconds.

39:11.223 --> 39:13.850
And mark.

39:14.018 --> 39:16.644
Engage deflector shield, full power.

39:21.776 --> 39:22.817
We lost it.

39:22.985 --> 39:26.029
We were unable to maintain phase
match with the distortion wave, sir.

39:26.197 --> 39:27.489
What went wrong, Mr. La Forge?

39:27.656 --> 39:29.824
LA FORGE: The speed differential
was too high, captain.

39:29.992 --> 39:34.329
Another distortion wave approaching.
Impact in 26 seconds.

39:34.497 --> 39:36.122
Our hull stress is already critical.

39:36.290 --> 39:38.333
We can't handle
many more jolts like that.

39:38.501 --> 39:41.836
Captain, l suggest
we take the ship to full impulse.

39:42.004 --> 39:43.338
If we can attain sufficient speed,

39:43.506 --> 39:45.298
it will lessen the impact
when the wave hits.

39:45.466 --> 39:47.592
Helm, full impulse.
Head us out of the rift.

39:47.760 --> 39:50.637
Mr. Worf, channel all available power
to the structural integrity fields.

39:50.805 --> 39:53.098
- Aye, sir.
- Standby deflector shield.

39:53.265 --> 39:54.766
We're ready, captain.

39:54.934 --> 39:56.684
Distortion wave impact
in five seconds.

39:57.144 --> 39:59.687
Engage deflector shield now.

40:04.151 --> 40:06.069
We are now within
the distortion wave.

40:06.237 --> 40:09.364
Hull stresses
have exceeded maximum tolerance.

40:09.532 --> 40:13.535
Structural integrity fields
are failing on decks 1 0 through 1 6.

40:13.702 --> 40:14.744
Switching to backups.

40:14.912 --> 40:17.247
We're separating
from the distortion wave.

40:17.415 --> 40:19.040
I'm attempting to compensate.

40:19.208 --> 40:20.959
How much longer
until we clear the rift?

40:21.127 --> 40:22.961
DATA:
Approximately 1 2 seconds, sir.

40:23.129 --> 40:25.755
Hull stress is 120 percent
above tolerance.

40:25.923 --> 40:27.841
A structural breach is imminent.

40:36.892 --> 40:38.726
We have cleared the rift, sir.

40:39.979 --> 40:42.230
Hull stress has returned to normal.

40:42.398 --> 40:44.274
Cancel red alert.

40:45.276 --> 40:48.736
Captain's log, stardate 4731 4.5.

40:48.904 --> 40:50.572
We have been continuing
our research

40:50.739 --> 40:54.075
while the Federation Council
studies our preliminary reports

40:54.243 --> 40:55.910
on the subspace rift.

40:56.078 --> 40:58.705
It now appears certain
that what we've seen here

40:58.873 --> 41:02.417
will have repercussions
for many years to come.

41:02.918 --> 41:06.254
Our scans show a lot of subspace
instabilities throughout the sector.

41:06.422 --> 41:08.423
If they're exposed
to enough warp energies,

41:08.591 --> 41:10.800
they could eventually create
other rifts.

41:11.260 --> 41:12.302
Dr. Rabal?

41:12.470 --> 41:15.013
Based on current warp drive patterns
in this sector,

41:15.181 --> 41:18.183
we've projected where subspace rifts
will be most likely to be formed

41:18.350 --> 41:21.144
over the next 40 years.

41:21.312 --> 41:23.855
This is how things are now.

41:24.482 --> 41:27.609
This is how they'll look in 1 0 years.

41:28.777 --> 41:30.111
Twenty years.

41:32.156 --> 41:34.157
Thirty years.

41:36.118 --> 41:38.077
Forty years.

41:39.788 --> 41:41.498
Thank you, doctor.

41:41.665 --> 41:43.374
Mr. La Forge?

41:45.920 --> 41:47.295
Uh...

41:48.130 --> 41:52.133
We have received new directives from
the Federation Council on this matter.

41:52.301 --> 41:54.969
Until we can find a way
to counteract the warp field effect,

41:55.137 --> 41:58.806
the Council feels our best course is to
slow the damage as much as possible.

41:58.974 --> 42:01.809
Therefore, areas of space
found susceptible to warp fields

42:01.977 --> 42:03.686
will be restricted
to essential travel only.

42:03.854 --> 42:04.979
And effective immediately,

42:05.147 --> 42:11.236
all Federation vessels will be limited
to a speed of warp five,

42:12.071 --> 42:14.280
except in cases
of extreme emergency.

42:14.448 --> 42:16.699
Well, the Klingons
will observe these restrictions,

42:16.867 --> 42:18.284
but the Romulans will not.

42:18.452 --> 42:22.080
And what about the Ferengi?
And the Cardassians, for that matter.

42:22.248 --> 42:25.875
The Federation is sharing all our data
with warp-capable species.

42:26.043 --> 42:28.545
We can only hope that they realize
it's in their own interests

42:28.712 --> 42:30.421
and take similar action.

42:30.589 --> 42:31.923
Putting limits on warp speed

42:32.091 --> 42:34.467
is only going
to prevent other rifts from forming.

42:34.635 --> 42:36.219
What are we going to do
about this one?

42:36.387 --> 42:38.388
Unfortunately, right now
there's not much we can do.

42:38.556 --> 42:42.141
The gravitational shifts have already
begun to affect my planet's orbit.

42:42.309 --> 42:43.685
Our climate is changing.

42:43.852 --> 42:46.854
The Federation is setting up
a weather control matrix on Hekaras Il.

42:47.022 --> 42:49.816
It's only a temporary solution,
but it should suffice for now.

42:49.984 --> 42:53.486
We're lucky the rift took place
as far away from the planet as it did.

42:53.654 --> 42:55.530
Gives us some time
to consider our options.

42:55.698 --> 42:57.865
If there are no more questions,
you are all dismissed.

43:13.132 --> 43:14.924
We should have
those thermal stabilizers ready

43:15.092 --> 43:17.844
- for the Hekarans in another day, sir.
PICARD: Very well.

43:18.012 --> 43:19.178
You know, Geordi,

43:19.346 --> 43:22.557
I spent the better part of my life
exploring space.

43:22.725 --> 43:29.147
I have charted new worlds,
I've met dozens of new species.

43:29.481 --> 43:33.067
And I believed that these
were all valuable ends in themselves.

43:33.235 --> 43:37.947
Now it seems that all this while,

43:38.115 --> 43:43.286
I was helping to damage
the thing that I hold most dear.

43:43.454 --> 43:46.205
It won't turn out that way, captain.

43:46.373 --> 43:48.833
We still have time to make it better.
