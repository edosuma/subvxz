00:00.001 --> 00:03.268
<i> PREVIOUSLY ON</i> PRETTY
LITTLE LIARS...

00:03.270 --> 00:04.470
I WAS HOPING MAYBE
YOU'D GO WITH ME.

00:04.472 --> 00:06.105
TO HOMECOMING?

00:06.107 --> 00:08.140
WHEN SHE FINDS OUT
THE TRUTH ABOUT YOU,
SHE'LL HATE YOU.

00:08.142 --> 00:11.143
WHO'S GONNA TELL HER?
I'M WEARING A SILVER
STRAPLESS DRESS.

00:11.145 --> 00:12.611
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
YOU IN IT.

00:12.613 --> 00:13.779
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

00:13.781 --> 00:15.114
I'M TALKING
ABOUT SPENCER.

00:15.116 --> 00:17.616
YOU KNOW, DATING YOU
TO PISS OFF OUR DAD.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.585
I KNOW IT'S OVER.
I KNOW THAT.

00:19.587 --> 00:22.121
<i> I JUST CAN'T STAND</i>
<i> THE IDEA OF YOU</i>

00:22.123 --> 00:23.422
WALKING AROUND
AND HATING ME.

00:23.424 --> 00:25.224
I COULD NEVER
HATE YOU.

00:25.226 --> 00:26.658
<i> THIS IS TYPICAL HANNA.</i>

00:26.660 --> 00:28.961
SHE MAKES A BIG DEAL
ABOUT COMING TO THIS THING,

00:28.963 --> 00:30.796
<i> AND THEN SHE DITCHES ME.</i>
<i> Spencer: IS THAT JENNA'S FILE?</i>

00:30.798 --> 00:32.698
<i> Hanna: NO,</i>
<i> I GOT TOBY'S.</i>

00:32.700 --> 00:34.166
THAT'S WHAT ALI
HAD ON HIM?

00:34.168 --> 00:36.168
IT'S ENOUGH
TO WANT HER DEAD.
AND US.

00:36.170 --> 00:38.170
I FIGURED OUT
WHAT TOBY'S TATTOO MEANS.

00:38.172 --> 00:40.672
<i> 901, FREE AT LAST?</i>

00:40.674 --> 00:41.874
IT'S SEPTEMBER 1st.

00:41.876 --> 00:43.709
THAT'S THE DAY ALI
DISAPPEARED.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.544
I'M NOT HIDING ANYTHING.

00:45.546 --> 00:48.313
THEN LOOK ME IN THE EYE
AND TELL ME YOU HAVE
NO FEELINGS FOR ME.

00:48.315 --> 00:51.050
Toby: DID YOU COME WITH
THE WRONG PERSON TO HOMECOMING?

00:51.052 --> 00:53.952
WE'VE ALL GOT SECRETS, EMILY.

00:53.954 --> 00:55.754
NO! AAH! AAH!

00:57.224 --> 00:59.525

01:01.195 --> 01:02.761
Hanna: EMILY!
Spencer: EMILY!

01:02.763 --> 01:04.296
Aria: EM, ARE
YOU UP HERE?

01:04.298 --> 01:05.864
Hanna: EMILY?

01:07.601 --> 01:09.101
( lights fritz )

01:10.905 --> 01:12.638
UM, WHY DON'T
WE SPLIT UP?

01:12.640 --> 01:14.440
<i> UM,</i> WHY DON'T WE NOT?

01:14.442 --> 01:15.808
HANNA, YOU CAN
COME WITH ME.

01:15.810 --> 01:16.909
WHY DO I HAVE
TO BE ALONE?

01:16.911 --> 01:19.211
FINE! WE'LL SPLIT UP
TOGETHER.

01:19.213 --> 01:20.779
WHO ARE YOU CALLING?

01:20.781 --> 01:22.781
I'M TRYING HER
UNTIL SHE PICKS UP.

01:22.783 --> 01:24.516
( cell phone tone playing )

01:26.620 --> 01:30.355
( distant song ends;
students cheer )

01:47.708 --> 01:48.707
EMILY?

01:59.320 --> 02:00.953
IS THAT BLOOD?

02:00.955 --> 02:02.154
Spencer: DON'T GO THERE.

02:02.156 --> 02:03.922
WHY NOT? SHE WAS
UP HERE WITH TOBY.

02:18.939 --> 02:20.973
( siren wailing )

02:24.245 --> 02:27.579
( dispatch radio chatter )

02:38.659 --> 02:39.858
<i> The Pierces:</i>
<i> ¶ GOT A SECRET ¶</i>

02:39.860 --> 02:41.426
<i> ¶ CAN YOU KEEP IT? ¶</i>

02:41.428 --> 02:43.462
<i> ¶ SWEAR THIS ONE YOU'LL SAVE ¶</i>

02:43.464 --> 02:45.998
<i> ¶ BETTER LOCK IT</i>
<i> IN YOUR POCKET ¶</i>

<i> ¶ WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID ¶</i>

02:56.043 --> 02:58.010
<i> ¶ IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD ¶</i>

( cop speaking indistinctly )

03:03.184 --> 03:05.250
( dispatch radio chatter )

03:11.825 --> 03:14.393
Aria: IT WAS ALL IN
HIS SHRINK'S FILE.

03:14.395 --> 03:16.361
TOBY AND JENNA
HAD A RELATIONSHIP.

03:16.363 --> 03:18.263
WAY BEYOND STEP-SIBLINGS.

03:18.265 --> 03:20.799
YEAH, THEY...
WERE INVOLVED.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.134
ROMANTICALLY?

03:22.136 --> 03:23.869
I DOUBT I'D CALL IT ROMANTIC.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.404
I DOUBT SHE HAD MUCH
OF A CHOICE.

03:25.406 --> 03:26.605
AND THAT'S
WHAT ALISON SAW

03:26.607 --> 03:28.073
WHEN SHE THREW
THE STINK BOMB.

03:28.075 --> 03:30.309
YEAH, AND SHE THREATENED
TO EXPOSE TOBY,

03:30.311 --> 03:32.411
WHICH IS PROBABLY
WHY HE WANTED HER DEAD.

03:32.413 --> 03:35.247
AND NOT JUST HER--
US. YOU.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.384
YOU DON'T BELIEVE US?

03:39.386 --> 03:42.221
I DO, I...

03:42.223 --> 03:45.057
I JUST DON'T GET IT.

03:45.059 --> 03:48.560
IF TOBY KILLED ALISON
AND WANTED TO DO THE SAME TO ME,

03:48.562 --> 03:51.396
THEN WHY AM I SITTING IN MY BED
AND NOT IN A BODY BAG?

03:54.101 --> 03:56.468
<i> Cop: SOMETHING ABOUT THIS</i>
<i> DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.</i>

03:56.470 --> 03:57.703
THE GUY JUST TOOK HER

03:57.705 --> 03:59.238
TO THE HOSPITAL
AND LEFT HER THERE.

03:59.240 --> 04:00.906
THE HOSPITAL SECURITY CAMERAS
CONFIRMED IT.

04:00.908 --> 04:03.609
HER DATE HANDED HER OVER
TO A NURSE AND RAN OFF.

04:03.611 --> 04:06.111
NO, THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE BEN.
HE WOULD'VE CALLED ME.

04:06.113 --> 04:07.613
BEN? WHO'S BEN?

04:07.615 --> 04:09.348
HER BOYFRIEND.
HER DATE.

04:09.350 --> 04:11.450
ACCORDING TO
THE SCHOOL'S GUEST LIST,

04:11.452 --> 04:13.118
SHE WENT WITH
TOBY CAVANAUGH.

04:15.256 --> 04:17.189
YOU DIDN'T KNOW THIS.

04:17.191 --> 04:19.224
NO. YES! OF COURSE
I KNEW THAT.

04:19.226 --> 04:22.227
I JUST-- I FORGOT.

04:22.229 --> 04:24.529
SO WHERE IS TOBY
NOW? DO YOU KNOW?

04:24.531 --> 04:26.698
WE DON'T KNOW.
LOOKS LIKE HE CAME HOME,

04:26.700 --> 04:30.002
TRADED IN THE FAMILY CAR FOR
HIS MOTORCYCLE, AND TOOK OFF.

04:30.004 --> 04:33.138
HAS EMILY SAID ANYTHING MORE
ABOUT HOW SHE WAS HURT?

04:36.277 --> 04:37.542
I TOLD THE POLICE

04:37.544 --> 04:39.311
THAT WHEN I WENT OUT
FOR AIR, I TRIPPED.

04:39.313 --> 04:42.514
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL
THEM HE ATTACKED YOU?

04:42.516 --> 04:44.116
I DIDN'T WANT
TO SAY ANYTHING

04:44.118 --> 04:46.151
UNTIL I TALKED
TO YOU GUYS FIRST.

04:46.153 --> 04:48.020
WELL, THE TRUTH
IS IN THE FILE.

04:51.191 --> 04:53.392
HEY, IS SHE
ALLOWED VISITORS?

04:53.394 --> 04:55.427
YEAH, GO ON UP,
BUT JUST FOR A LITTLE BIT,

04:55.429 --> 04:56.595
'CAUSE SHE REALLY NEEDS
HER REST, OKAY?

04:58.499 --> 05:00.999
MRS. FIELDS, WE ONLY HAVE
A FEW QUESTIONS FOR HER.

05:01.001 --> 05:03.168
LOOK, WHATEVER EMILY
TOLD YOU IS WHAT HAPPENED.

05:03.170 --> 05:05.337
WELL, MAYBE SHE REMEMBERS
MORE THIS MORNING.

05:05.339 --> 05:08.206
SHE MIGHT BE
PROTECTING THIS KID.

05:08.208 --> 05:10.008
SHE MIGHT BE
AFRAID OF HIM.

05:10.010 --> 05:11.777
OFFICER, MY DAUGHTER
DOESN'T LIE.

05:11.779 --> 05:14.613
MA'AM, EVERYBODY LIES.

05:14.615 --> 05:16.548
<i> Spencer: YOU CAN TELL THEM</i>
<i> EVERYTHING NOW.</i>

05:16.550 --> 05:18.383
SHE CAN'T TELL
THEM EVERYTHING.

05:18.385 --> 05:20.085
YOU HAVE TO
LEAVE OUT THE FILE.

05:20.087 --> 05:22.521
FINE. LEAVE OUT THE FILE.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.792
WHO KNEW ROSEWOOD
HAD THIS MANY COPS?

05:26.794 --> 05:29.261
I WENT TO PUT THIS BACK,
AND THEY WERE OUTSIDE

05:29.263 --> 05:31.430
THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE
TALKING TO TOBY'S SHRINK.

05:31.432 --> 05:32.998
THEY KNOW
THIS WAS STOLEN.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.067
CAN I SEE THAT?

05:35.069 --> 05:37.069
IF ANYONE SAW ME
GO INTO THAT BUILDING

05:37.071 --> 05:38.770
LAST NIGHT,
I AM SO HOSED.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.005
( ringing )

05:41.575 --> 05:44.476
IS THAT FROM--?
NO, MY MOM.

05:44.478 --> 05:46.078
"ASK YOUR FATHER
IF HE PLANS

05:46.080 --> 05:48.113
TO TAKE THE CAR IN
THIS WEEK."

05:48.115 --> 05:49.781
MY PARENTS HAVE GONE

05:49.783 --> 05:52.050
FROM NOT TALKING
TO NOT TEXTING.

05:52.052 --> 05:54.086
UGH, THIS SUCKS.

05:54.088 --> 05:56.455
I BETTER GO HOME.

05:56.457 --> 05:57.689
YEAH, WE SHOULD
PROBABLY GO, TOO.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.591
UH, NO.
I JUST GOT HERE.

05:59.593 --> 06:01.760
HEY, WHAT DO
I DO WITH THAT?

06:01.762 --> 06:04.663
JUST SHOVE IT
IN YOUR LOCKER TOMORROW.

06:04.665 --> 06:06.798
WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT LATER.
BYE.

06:06.800 --> 06:07.833
FEEL BETTER, EM.

06:13.807 --> 06:15.540
IS THAT THE CAR
YOU WON OUTSIDE?

06:17.444 --> 06:19.144
OKAY, HOW DO YOU
GO TO HOMECOMING,

06:19.146 --> 06:20.345
CRACK YOUR HEAD OPEN,

06:20.347 --> 06:22.314
AND THEN WIN A COROLLA
IN A RAFFLE?

06:22.316 --> 06:24.583
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT YOUR KARMA.

06:28.021 --> 06:31.289
WHY DID YOU THINK I WOULD
TAKE MAYA TO THE DANCE?

06:31.291 --> 06:33.125
WHAT?

06:33.127 --> 06:35.594
YOU THOUGHT I WANTED HER
AS MY DATE. WHY?

06:37.664 --> 06:40.365
"A" SENT ME A PICTURE...

06:40.367 --> 06:44.002
OF YOU AND MAYA KISSING.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.904
SO, CAN I JUST ASK?

06:45.906 --> 06:48.073
I MEAN, YOU TOOK TOBY
TO THE DANCE,

06:48.075 --> 06:50.475
BUT THEN YOU TOOK
THAT PICTURE WITH MAYA.

06:56.183 --> 06:58.583
I THINK I KNOW WHAT I WANT,

06:58.585 --> 07:01.887
BUT IF I SAY YES TO MAYA,
EVERYTHING WOULD CHANGE.

07:01.889 --> 07:04.423
YOU KNOW IT WOULD.
YEAH, IT WOULD.

07:04.425 --> 07:06.258
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO PRETEND
YOU'RE SOMEONE YOU'RE NOT.

07:06.260 --> 07:10.362
BUT WHAT IF I'M WRONG?
WHAT IF I'M NOT... THAT PERSON?

07:10.364 --> 07:13.331
EMILY, YOU'RE NOT
SIGNING A CONTRACT.

07:13.333 --> 07:14.866
YOU WERE EMILY
DATING BEN,

07:14.868 --> 07:16.601
AND NOW YOU'RE
EMILY DATING MAYA.

07:16.603 --> 07:19.304
WE LOVE EMILY. NO ONE
CARES WHO YOU'RE WITH.

07:19.306 --> 07:22.741
REALLY? HAVE YOU MET
MY PARENTS...

07:22.743 --> 07:26.144
MR. AND MRS. MILITARY
AND THEIR PERFECT DAUGHTER.

07:35.055 --> 07:38.390
UM, HI.
I'M LOOKING FOR ALEX?

07:38.392 --> 07:41.259
SPENCER? WHAT ARE
YOU DOING BACK HERE?

07:41.261 --> 07:42.828
LOOKING FOR YOU.

07:42.830 --> 07:45.564
THE GUY IN THE PRO SHOP
SAID YOU WERE ON KITCHEN DUTY.

07:45.566 --> 07:47.899
GENERAL MANAGER FIRED
12 PEOPLE THIS MORNING.

07:47.901 --> 07:50.335
WHY?
TURNS OUT
OUR LAUNDRY SERVICE

07:50.337 --> 07:51.903
WAS LAUNDERING
MORE THAN NAPKINS,

07:51.905 --> 07:54.072
SO I GET TO BE
THE SOUS CHEF TODAY.

07:54.074 --> 07:57.442
UM, CAN YOU TAKE A BREAK
SO WE CAN TALK?

07:57.444 --> 07:59.244
I NEED TO FINISH THIS.

07:59.246 --> 08:01.713
I REALLY HAVE TO EXPLAIN
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

08:01.715 --> 08:03.515
DON'T WORRY, YOUR SISTER
ALREADY DID THAT.

08:03.517 --> 08:05.250
NO, MY SISTER LIED!

08:05.252 --> 08:06.718
YOU CAN'T BE BACK HERE.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.887
THIS IS STAFF ONLY.
NO MEMBERS ALLOWED.

08:08.889 --> 08:10.689
LOOK, I'M SORRY.
I'LL BE GONE IN JUST A MINUTE.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.757
CAN WE AT LEAST
TRY IT AGAIN?

08:12.759 --> 08:14.626
I OWE YOU
A COMPLETE DO-OVER.

08:14.628 --> 08:15.994
YOU'RE VIOLATING, LIKE,

08:15.996 --> 08:17.662
A MILLION HEALTH CODES
RIGHT NOW.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.397
I'VE ALREADY HAD MY SHOTS,

08:19.399 --> 08:22.901
AND I WON'T TOUCH
THE TARTAR SAUCE, OKAY?

08:22.903 --> 08:25.504
YOU WANNA GET
CANNED, TOO?

08:25.506 --> 08:27.038
IT'S OKAY.

08:32.880 --> 08:36.047
OOH. GOT STEPHANIE
MAD AT YOU.

08:36.049 --> 08:37.382
OKAY, I'LL WORRY ABOUT THAT

08:37.384 --> 08:39.184
IF I EVER ORDER
THE CLAM CHOWDER.

08:39.186 --> 08:42.554
ANOTHER CHANCE?

08:42.556 --> 08:44.956
TOMORROW NIGHT, PLEASE.

08:47.594 --> 08:49.828
ALL RIGHT.

08:49.830 --> 08:52.063
ONLY IF I GET TO PLAN
THE WHOLE NIGHT OUT,

08:52.065 --> 08:54.566
START TO FINISH,
AND YOU GO ALONG
WITH WHATEVER I SAY.

08:54.568 --> 08:56.835
SOUNDS KIND OF DANGEROUS.

08:56.837 --> 08:58.937
ONLY TO SOMEONE WHO'S USED
TO RUNNING THE SHOW.

09:01.441 --> 09:02.574
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE ON.

09:04.811 --> 09:07.379
( phone ringing )

09:07.381 --> 09:09.514
<i> THIS IS EZRA.</i>
<i> SORRY I'M NOT HERE.</i>

09:09.516 --> 09:12.317
<i> YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.</i>
( beep )

09:12.319 --> 09:14.252
<i> Aria: HI, IT'S-- IT'S ME.</i>

09:14.254 --> 09:17.455
<i> I CALLED AND LEFT</i>
<i> A MESSAGE ON YOUR CELL, AND...</i>

09:17.457 --> 09:21.293
UM... CAN YOU JUST CALL ME
WHEN YOU GET THIS?

09:21.295 --> 09:23.795
THANKS. I'LL TALK
TO YOU LATER. BYE.

09:23.797 --> 09:25.864
HEY.
HEY.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.566
DID DAD GET YOU FLOWERS?

09:27.568 --> 09:29.768
NO, UH, THESE CAME
FOR YOU.

09:32.406 --> 09:33.672
WHO ARE THEY FROM?

09:35.375 --> 09:36.908
HEY.

09:38.278 --> 09:39.978
UH, DAD'S GONNA DRIVE
OVER TO PRACTICE

09:39.980 --> 09:41.146
AND STAY
FOR THE GAME.

09:42.549 --> 09:44.082
SHOULD I SAVE YOU
A SEAT?

09:44.084 --> 09:47.852
UH, HONEY, I THINK I'M GONNA
HAVE TO MISS THIS ONE.

09:51.658 --> 09:53.391
WHATEVER.

09:55.228 --> 09:57.295
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SIT WITH DAD.

09:57.297 --> 09:58.930
YEAH, BUT THAT
WOULD LOOK WORSE

09:58.932 --> 10:00.832
THAN NOT GOING AT ALL,
WOULDN'T IT?

10:29.196 --> 10:30.629
( barks )

10:42.876 --> 10:44.809
SO, YOU'RE AWAKE.

10:48.582 --> 10:49.748
AM I?

10:52.019 --> 10:54.252
YEAH, I, UH, I TOLD JENNA

10:54.254 --> 10:56.521
THAT YOU ALREADY HAD
A LOT OF VISITORS TODAY,

10:56.523 --> 10:58.189
BUT SHE INSISTED.

10:58.191 --> 11:01.059
SHE AND HER MOTHER
BAKED YOU SOME COOKIES.

11:01.061 --> 11:03.228
Jenna: THEY TASTE
EVEN BETTER WITH MILK.

11:05.699 --> 11:06.898
YOU HAVE MILK, DON'T YOU?

11:09.236 --> 11:11.603
YEAH. YES.

11:11.605 --> 11:14.005
OF COURSE
WE HAVE MILK.

11:24.584 --> 11:27.218
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

11:27.220 --> 11:29.587
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

11:29.589 --> 11:31.790
I'M WORRIED ABOUT TOBY,
AND I THINK YOU'RE

11:31.792 --> 11:34.159
THE ONLY PERSON
WHO KNOWS WHERE HE IS.

11:34.161 --> 11:35.226
SIT, SHADOW.

11:38.899 --> 11:40.565
UM, H-HOW WOULD I KNOW?

11:40.567 --> 11:42.267
BECAUSE YOU'RE ONE
OF THE FEW PEOPLE

11:42.269 --> 11:43.468
THAT HE TRUSTED.

11:43.470 --> 11:45.870
LOOK, EMILY,
TOBY IS TROUBLED.

11:48.341 --> 11:52.510
( sighs ) I'M REALLY...
AFRAID OF WHAT HE MIGHT DO.

11:52.512 --> 11:54.112
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

11:54.114 --> 11:56.081
NOW THE POLICE
ARE LOOKING FOR THAT FILE,

11:56.083 --> 11:57.449
AND PEOPLE THINK
THAT HE'S--

11:57.451 --> 12:01.219
( sighs )

12:01.221 --> 12:03.888
IF IT FALLS
INTO THE WRONG HANDS, I--

12:03.890 --> 12:05.890
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

12:05.892 --> 12:07.258
I WOULD'VE THOUGHT
YOU WOULD'VE

12:07.260 --> 12:08.693
BEEN RELIEVED
THAT HE WAS GONE.

12:10.931 --> 12:12.197
SO YOU'VE READ IT.

12:14.935 --> 12:16.735
YOUR FRIENDS HAVE
SHARED IT WITH YOU.

12:16.737 --> 12:18.970
NO ONE'S GONNA TELL.

12:18.972 --> 12:20.538
WELL, YOU SAY THAT,

12:20.540 --> 12:23.141
BUT SECRETS HAVE A WAY
OF GETTING OUT...

12:23.143 --> 12:24.542
LIKE WHAT ALISON SHARED

12:24.544 --> 12:26.077
WHEN SHE VISITED ME
AT THE HOSPITAL.

12:28.949 --> 12:31.316
I'VE KEPT QUIET
ABOUT A LOT, EMILY.

12:31.318 --> 12:33.885
THE LEAST YOU CAN DO
IS GET ME THAT FILE.

12:36.790 --> 12:38.389
YOU OWE ME THAT MUCH.

12:54.040 --> 12:56.674
KNOCK, KNOCK.

12:56.676 --> 12:58.743
YOU SAID 1:30,
RIGHT?

12:58.745 --> 13:00.245
AM I EARLY?

13:00.247 --> 13:02.847
YOU'RE PERFECT.
I MEAN, LIKE, ON TIME.

13:02.849 --> 13:05.316
WELL, THE CUSTODIAN DIDN'T
EVEN WANT TO LET ME IN.

13:05.318 --> 13:07.185
YOU TOLD HIM WE WERE DOING
A MAKE-UP PICTURE, RIGHT?

13:07.187 --> 13:10.522
WHO, CARL? YEAH, TWICE.

13:10.524 --> 13:13.424
HE'S OUT OF IT.

13:13.426 --> 13:15.493
THIRTY YEARS
OF BREATHING FLOOR WAX

13:15.495 --> 13:18.296
DOES WICKED THINGS
TO YOUR BRAIN.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.598
THEN THERE'S
THE VODKA.

13:20.600 --> 13:21.666
( chuckles )

13:23.603 --> 13:26.371
UGH. I GOT THREE HOURS
OF SLEEP LAST NIGHT.

13:26.373 --> 13:28.840
I LOOK LIKE SOMETHING
CARL COUGHED UP.

13:30.710 --> 13:33.044
WELL, I THINK
YOU LOOK EVEN BETTER

13:33.046 --> 13:36.981
THAN YOU DID LAST NIGHT,
IF THAT'S, LIKE, POSSIBLE.

13:43.623 --> 13:46.191
UM, WE'RE SURE SEAN'S
COMING TO THIS?

13:46.193 --> 13:48.927
YEAH, WHY
WOULDN'T HE BE?

13:48.929 --> 13:51.396
HE'S NOT REALLY HAPPY
WITH ME...

13:51.398 --> 13:53.932
NOT BEING THERE WHEN
THEY CALLED OUR NAMES,

13:53.934 --> 13:56.935
AND... IS THAT
THE CROWN?

13:58.905 --> 14:01.072
JEEZ, IT'S SO TINY.

14:01.074 --> 14:03.241
I CAN MAKE IT LOOK BIGGER
IN THE PICTURE.

14:03.243 --> 14:05.610
YOU KNOW, IF YOU TILT
YOUR HEAD TO THE RIGHT--

14:05.612 --> 14:07.111
NO, IT'S NOT THAT,
IT'S JUST...

14:07.113 --> 14:09.614
IT ALWAYS
SEEMED SO HUGE.

14:09.616 --> 14:11.749
YOU KNOW, LAST
YEAR'S PICTURE OF

14:11.751 --> 14:14.052
THE HOMECOMING QUEEN
OUTSIDE THE GYM.

14:14.054 --> 14:15.720
YEAH, I KNOW,
I TOOK IT.

14:15.722 --> 14:21.059
BUT JESSICA WYLIE
IS KIND OF A PINHEAD.

14:21.061 --> 14:25.430
ALTHOUGH HER HEAD DID GET
A LOT BIGGER AFTER SHE WON.

14:25.432 --> 14:26.698
IT HAPPENS.

14:28.501 --> 14:29.968
( Sean sniffs )

14:29.970 --> 14:31.469
HEY.
HEY.

14:31.471 --> 14:33.371
SO, UH, WE GONNA
DO THIS OR NOT?

14:33.373 --> 14:34.806
I GOT A BASKETBALL
GAME HAPPENING.

14:34.808 --> 14:37.909
GOT IT. IF YOU GUYS
WOULDN'T MIND STANDING

14:37.911 --> 14:39.644
( cell phone ringing )
...NEAR THE BACKDROP.

14:42.449 --> 14:43.948
OH, GO AHEAD,
ANSWER IT.

14:43.950 --> 14:47.051
I'M SURE IT'S SOMEONE
THAT PULLS RANK OVER ME.

14:47.053 --> 14:48.052
<i> ( shutter clicks )</i>

14:54.928 --> 14:56.661
HANNA, WHERE ARE YOU?

14:56.663 --> 14:59.130
CALL ME. JENNA CAME--

14:59.132 --> 15:01.266
SO, WHENEVER YOU
GET HERE, JUST...

15:01.268 --> 15:04.035
WHENEVER YOU GET THIS,
JUST GIVE ME A CALL. THANKS.

15:04.037 --> 15:05.770
WHAT WAS THAT
ALL ABOUT?

15:07.674 --> 15:09.874
WHO WERE YOU
TALKING TO?

15:09.876 --> 15:14.445
UM, HANNA BORROWED
MY LIP GLOSS LAST NIGHT.

15:14.447 --> 15:16.614
IF I DON'T HOUND HER,
I'LL NEVER GET IT BACK.

15:19.019 --> 15:21.219
MOM, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BABY-SIT ME.

15:23.023 --> 15:24.689
YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:24.691 --> 15:27.191
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE
NEEDING THAT TODAY.

15:27.193 --> 15:28.593
JUST YOU AND ME.

15:38.905 --> 15:42.006
EXCELLENT.
EXCELLENT.

15:42.008 --> 15:44.742
UH, SEAN, COULD YOU SCOOCH
A LITTLE BIT CLOSER TO HANNA

15:44.744 --> 15:46.444
AND PUT YOUR HANDS
ON HER HIPS?

15:46.446 --> 15:49.414
YEP, THAT'S IT.
THAT'S IT.

15:49.416 --> 15:52.583
OKAY, HEADS UP,
SHOULDERS BACK.

15:52.585 --> 15:54.686
THINK CAMELOT.

15:54.688 --> 15:55.987
JUST TAKE THE PICTURE.

15:57.457 --> 16:00.658
YOU KNOW, I'M JUST NOT
LOVING THIS LIGHT.

16:03.830 --> 16:05.663
LOOK, I SAID
I WAS SORRY.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.832
IT WASN'T ABOUT YOU.
I WAS DEALING WITH EMILY.

16:07.834 --> 16:09.100
YOU'RE CROOKED.

16:09.102 --> 16:10.301
WHAT?

16:10.303 --> 16:12.036
YOUR CROWN.

16:12.038 --> 16:14.672
OKAY, MUCH, MUCH BETTER.

16:14.674 --> 16:17.942
UH... READY,
YOUR MAJESTIES?

16:17.944 --> 16:20.511
SMILE FOR THE PEASANTS.

16:20.513 --> 16:22.246
SMILE, SEAN.

16:30.390 --> 16:32.757
DID YOU THINK I WOULDN'T
LET YOU GO TO HOMECOMING

16:32.759 --> 16:34.959
IF I KNEW YOU WERE GOING
WITH TOBY CAVANAUGH?

16:34.961 --> 16:36.127
WHAT?

16:36.129 --> 16:37.729
YOU HEARD ME.

16:37.731 --> 16:40.631
YES.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

16:40.633 --> 16:43.001
I WOULDN'T HAVE.
THAT GUY IS TROUBLE.

16:43.003 --> 16:45.236
PEOPLE CROSS THE STREET
TO THE OTHER SIDE

16:45.238 --> 16:47.171
WHEN THEY
SEE HIM COMING.

16:47.173 --> 16:49.507
I DON'T. I DIDN'T--

16:51.478 --> 16:53.077
I JUST THOUGHT
HE WAS MISUNDERSTOOD.

16:53.079 --> 16:55.847
DIFFERENT.
DIFFERENT.
I THINK HIS STEPSISTER

16:55.849 --> 16:57.448
PROBABLY THOUGHT
HE WAS DIFFERENT, TOO,

16:57.450 --> 16:59.083
AND NOW SHE NEEDS
A SEEING-EYE DOG.

16:59.085 --> 17:00.918
HE DIDN'T DO THAT.
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

17:00.920 --> 17:02.286
HOW DO YOU KNOW
THAT, EMILY?

17:02.288 --> 17:03.588
AND WHAT ABOUT
LAST NIGHT?

17:03.590 --> 17:05.356
WAS THAT AN ACCIDENT
AS WELL?

17:05.358 --> 17:07.492
COME ON, HOW MANY GUYS
DROP THEIR DATES OFF

17:07.494 --> 17:09.127
AT THE HOSPITAL
AND THEN RUN AWAY?

17:09.129 --> 17:10.328
WHAT'S HE
TRYING TO HIDE?

17:10.330 --> 17:11.763
MOM...

17:11.765 --> 17:13.531
HONEY, DID HE TRY
TO PRESSURE YOU

17:13.533 --> 17:15.666
INTO SOMETHING YOU
WEREN'T READY FOR?

17:15.668 --> 17:17.001
THAT'S NOT
WHAT HAPPENED.

17:17.003 --> 17:18.503
WELL, THEN,
WHAT HAPPENED?

17:18.505 --> 17:19.737
WHAT HAPPENED,
EMILY?

17:19.739 --> 17:21.806
WHY DON'T YOU START
BY TELLING ME THAT.

17:21.808 --> 17:23.975
TOBY CAVANAUGH DIDN'T
GET SENT AWAY FOR A YEAR

17:23.977 --> 17:25.710
BECAUSE HE ROLLED
THROUGH A STOP SIGN.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.345
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS

17:27.347 --> 17:29.013
WHAT OUR NEIGHBORS
THINK OF HIM,

17:29.015 --> 17:30.415
WHAT THEY'RE GONNA
THINK OF YOU?

17:32.619 --> 17:34.085
I NEED SOME SLEEP.

17:37.057 --> 17:38.723
HONEY, WHAT YOU NEED

17:38.725 --> 17:41.626
IS TO START
BEING HONEST WITH ME...

17:41.628 --> 17:42.994
AND WITH YOURSELF.

17:48.735 --> 17:52.503
OKAY. THIS--
THIS MAY BE A BAD IDEA,

17:52.505 --> 17:56.040
BUT... WE SHOULD GET ONE
OF THE QUEEN

17:56.042 --> 17:57.875
SITTING ON YOUR LAP.

17:59.913 --> 18:03.548
NO. NO, WE'RE DONE HERE.

18:03.550 --> 18:06.050
SEAN, HE'S DOING HIS JOB.
HE'S NOT TRYING TO TORTURE US.

18:06.052 --> 18:07.218
COULD'VE FOOLED ME.

18:07.220 --> 18:08.586
I COULD PHOTOSHOP
PANTS ON YOU.

18:08.588 --> 18:09.687
I SAID WE'RE DONE.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.422
ARE YOU TALKING
TO HIM OR ME?

18:11.424 --> 18:13.057
HANNA, DON'T
PUSH IT, OKAY?

18:13.059 --> 18:14.592
YOU WEREN'T THE ONE
STANDING ALONE LAST NIGHT

18:14.594 --> 18:16.327
LOOKING LIKE A JACKASS
BECAUSE YOUR DATE BAILED ON YOU.

18:16.329 --> 18:18.996
I'M SORRY I DESERTED YOU.
MY FRIEND CRACKED HER HEAD OPEN.

18:18.998 --> 18:20.465
THIS WAS WAY
BEFORE EMILY!

18:20.467 --> 18:21.999
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:22.001 --> 18:23.367
WE NEED
CANDID SHOTS, TOO.

18:23.369 --> 18:25.203
YOU PUT THAT
IN YOUR YEARBOOK, BRO,

18:25.205 --> 18:27.772
YOU'LL BE PULLING
THAT CAMERA OUT OF YOUR--
SEAN, STOP!

18:27.774 --> 18:29.740
DON'T JUMP ON HIM
'CAUSE YOU'RE MAD AT ME.

18:29.742 --> 18:32.310
I'M NOT MAD.
I'M OUT OF HERE.

18:37.717 --> 18:39.584
DID YOU GET
WHAT YOU NEEDED?

18:51.664 --> 18:53.197
( knocking )

18:53.199 --> 18:54.832
Byron: CAN I INTERRUPT?

18:54.834 --> 18:56.033
HOW WAS THE GAME?

18:56.035 --> 18:57.668
WELL, THEY LOST,

18:57.670 --> 18:59.370
BUT YOUR BROTHER
TORE UP THE FIELD.

18:59.372 --> 19:02.773
HMM. DID MOM MAKE IT?

19:02.775 --> 19:04.609
UH, NO. NO,
SHE DIDN'T,

19:04.611 --> 19:06.444
BUT... WE MISSED
HER, THOUGH.

19:06.446 --> 19:08.679
MM, DO I HAVE
TO TELL HER THAT,

19:08.681 --> 19:10.882
OR CAN YOU GIVE HER
THAT MESSAGE YOURSELF?

19:12.552 --> 19:15.052
LISTEN, ARIA,
NOBODY WANTED IT

19:15.054 --> 19:17.388
TO COME TO THIS, OKAY?

19:17.390 --> 19:19.891
YOUR MOM AND I HAVE BEEN
TOGETHER SINCE WE WERE KIDS.

19:19.893 --> 19:21.993
YOU WEREN'T KIDS.
YOU WERE IN COLLEGE.

19:21.995 --> 19:23.928
NO, WE WERE KIDS.

19:23.930 --> 19:27.298
NEITHER ONE OF US
HAD EVER BEEN 50 MILES
AWAY FROM HOME.

19:27.300 --> 19:28.833
WE'D NEVER--
ARE YOU MOVING OUT?

19:28.835 --> 19:31.602
( sighs )

19:31.604 --> 19:33.271
JUST TELL ME NOW,

19:33.273 --> 19:35.506
'CAUSE I DON'T WANNA
FIND OUT YOU'RE GONE

19:35.508 --> 19:37.808
WHILE I'M SETTING
THE TABLE FOR DINNER.

19:37.810 --> 19:40.344
I WOULD NEVER DO
THAT TO YOU...

19:41.948 --> 19:44.048
OR YOUR BROTHER,

19:44.050 --> 19:47.418
BUT YOUR MOM THINKS
THAT IT'S BEST

19:47.420 --> 19:49.587
THAT WE SPEND
SOME TIME APART,

19:49.589 --> 19:52.690
SO I HAVE AGREED TO--
WHAT?

19:52.692 --> 19:55.826
YOU HAVE AGREED TO
MOVE IN WITH MEREDITH?

19:55.828 --> 19:58.062
NO. NO, GOD-- NO.

19:58.064 --> 20:00.998
ARIA, MEREDITH
IS NOT THE ISSUE HERE.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.501
MEREDITH IS JUST A WOMAN
THAT I WORK WITH.

20:03.503 --> 20:05.436
THAT'S IT. PERIOD.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.607
DO YOU STILL LOVE MOM?

20:09.609 --> 20:11.943
I DO.

20:11.945 --> 20:13.844
AND I'M LEAVING
BECAUSE--

20:13.846 --> 20:17.315
BECAUSE IT'S...
EASIER TO WALK AWAY

20:17.317 --> 20:19.417
THAN TO FIGHT FOR WHAT
YOU REALLY WANT.

20:20.954 --> 20:23.187
YOU'RE YOUNG, SWEETHEART.

20:23.189 --> 20:25.756
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS
GOING ON HERE

20:25.758 --> 20:29.026
THAT ARE JUST OUTSIDE
OF YOUR REACH.

20:29.028 --> 20:30.628
YEAH. WELL...

20:32.565 --> 20:34.699
THIS ISN'T ONE
OF THEM.

20:38.304 --> 20:40.037
( sighs )

21:01.127 --> 21:03.694
Aria: HANNA.
Spencer: HANNA,
SLOW DOWN.

21:03.696 --> 21:05.229
WILL YOU STOP?
YOU'RE GONNA--

21:05.231 --> 21:06.530
Aria: HANNA,
SPENCER'S RIGHT.

21:06.532 --> 21:09.000
BURNING THE FOLDER
OUT HERE IS A BAD IDEA.

21:12.972 --> 21:14.639
LOOK, THIS IS
A TERRIBLE IDEA.

21:16.843 --> 21:19.110
JUST STAY HERE.
FINE!

21:19.112 --> 21:21.712
HANNA, HANNA!

21:21.714 --> 21:23.147
HANNA, WAIT!

21:24.450 --> 21:26.617
WHY AM I STAYING HERE?

21:26.619 --> 21:29.153
( cell phone ringing )

21:37.697 --> 21:39.664
Aria: CAN WE AT LEAST
TALK ABOUT THIS?

21:39.666 --> 21:41.699
Hanna: NO! I DON'T WANT THIS
IN MY HOUSE.

21:41.701 --> 21:43.267
I DON'T WANT IT
IN MY LOCKER.

21:43.269 --> 21:44.902
I WILL MAIL IT
TO THE POLICE.

21:44.904 --> 21:46.103
NO, IT'S NOT
GONNA HAPPEN.

21:46.105 --> 21:47.738
I'M NOT HAVING THIS
TRACED BACK TO ME.

21:47.740 --> 21:49.540
HOW ARE THEY GONNA
TRACE IT BACK TO YOU?

21:49.542 --> 21:51.008
I'M THE ONE
LICKING THE ENVELOPE!

21:51.010 --> 21:52.877
GUYS!
I'M THE ONE WHO WORKS
IN THAT BUILDING.

21:52.879 --> 21:54.879
I'M ALSO THE ONE
WHO ALWAYS GETS CAUGHT.

21:54.881 --> 21:56.380
HANNA, SPENCER'S RIGHT.

21:56.382 --> 21:59.250
BURNING THE FOLDER OUT HERE
IS A BAD IDEA

21:59.252 --> 22:02.153
IF THE POLICE COULD USE IT
TO BUILD A CASE AGAINST TOBY.

22:02.155 --> 22:03.854
HE HAD A MOTIVE
TO KILL ALISON!

22:03.856 --> 22:05.256
AND THEY CAN ALSO PROVE

22:05.258 --> 22:06.991
THAT I BROKE
INTO HIS SHRINK'S OFFICE.

22:06.993 --> 22:08.959
LOOK, I REALLY CAN'T
AFFORD TO TAKE

22:08.961 --> 22:10.695
ANY MORE FIELD TRIPS
TO THE PRECINCT.

22:10.697 --> 22:12.396
I'M PRETTY SURE
AFTER THREE STRIKES,

22:12.398 --> 22:14.198
YOU'RE ASSIGNED
TO THE PRISON LAUNDRY ROOM.

22:14.200 --> 22:15.433
HANNA, WHAT STRIKES?

22:15.435 --> 22:17.468
YOU WERE JUST TRYING
TO SAVE YOUR FRIEND.

22:17.470 --> 22:19.837
LOOK, I HAVE ALREADY
GOTTEN BUSTED

22:19.839 --> 22:21.939
FOR STEALING SUNGLASSES
AND MY BOYFRIEND'S CAR.

22:21.941 --> 22:23.841
WAIT, YOU STOLE
SUNGLASSES? FROM WHO?

22:23.843 --> 22:27.445
NOT FROM A PERSON, FROM A STORE.
GOD, I HAVE SOME CLASS.

22:27.447 --> 22:29.413
WAIT, ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT THOSE...

22:29.415 --> 22:31.382
THE GUCCI ONES
WITH THE GOLD--
FOCUS!

22:31.384 --> 22:33.884
OKAY, HANNA, THIS IS NOT
ABOUT PETTY THEFT.

22:33.886 --> 22:35.252
TOBY COULD BE
THE KILLER.

22:35.254 --> 22:36.954
WE CAN'T KEEP MAKING
THESE SAME MISTAKES

22:36.956 --> 22:38.322
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

22:38.324 --> 22:40.825
WE?
YES, WE!

22:40.827 --> 22:43.094
OKAY? WE ARE ALL
IN THIS TOGETHER.

22:43.096 --> 22:44.528
WE ARE ALL BEING
STALKED BY "A,"

22:44.530 --> 22:45.830
AND IF HE'S
RUN OFF--

22:45.832 --> 22:47.531
WE DON'T KNOW
THAT HE'S "A."

22:47.533 --> 22:50.901
PLEASE! HAVE YOU GOTTEN
ONE SINGLE TEXT
SINCE LAST NIGHT?

22:50.903 --> 22:53.838
OKAY, THE DEVIL HAS A NAME,
AND IT'S TOBY.

22:53.840 --> 22:55.973
WHY ARE YOU BEING
SO PIG-HEADED?!

22:55.975 --> 22:58.309
WHY? BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE
A BIG, FAT SAFETY NET

22:58.311 --> 23:00.444
TO CATCH ME.
NOT ALL OF US HAVE A DADDY

23:00.446 --> 23:02.680
WHO CAN WRITE A CHECK
TO MAKE THE BOOGEYMAN GO AWAY.

23:02.682 --> 23:04.348
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

23:04.350 --> 23:06.117
SPENCER, YOU GET CAUGHT
STEALING AN ESSAY,

23:06.119 --> 23:07.952
AND YOUR PARENTS LET YOU TAKE
A PICTURE FOR THE NEWSPAPER.

23:07.954 --> 23:10.087
I GET CAUGHT
STEALING AN ACCESSORY,

23:10.089 --> 23:12.356
AND I HAVE TO LUG AROUND
MEDICAL WASTE.

23:14.193 --> 23:16.093
THERE. IT'S DONE, OKAY?

23:23.336 --> 23:25.503
WE NEVER SAW IT,
AND WE DON'T EVEN
KNOW IT EXISTS.

23:27.707 --> 23:30.508
( sighs ) CAN WE
LEAVE NOW, PLEASE?

23:42.855 --> 23:44.688
( cell phone rings )

23:58.604 --> 24:00.971
HEY, ARE YOU TAKING
SOMETHING FOR THE PAIN?

24:00.973 --> 24:04.842
YEAH, BUT NOTHING
THAT DULLS MY MOTHER.

24:04.844 --> 24:06.877
SHE'S GOT
A ZILLION QUESTIONS,

24:06.879 --> 24:09.079
AND THEY'RE GETTING
HARDER TO DODGE.

24:09.081 --> 24:11.282
I CAN'T BELIEVE JENNA
WAS IN YOUR HOUSE.

24:11.284 --> 24:12.950
YOU DIDN'T EAT
THAT COOKIE, DID YOU?

24:12.952 --> 24:15.152
NO.

24:15.154 --> 24:17.488
( cell phone tones play )

24:19.392 --> 24:21.058
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S NOT FROM "A."

24:21.060 --> 24:22.927
I THINK WE CAN
FINALLY STOP FLINCHING

24:22.929 --> 24:24.428
EVERY TIME
OUR PHONES RING.

24:24.430 --> 24:25.596
HEY, IT'S FROM ALEX.

24:28.100 --> 24:30.401
( whispering )

24:33.806 --> 24:35.573
( slams )

24:35.575 --> 24:37.208
WHAT'S WRONG?

24:37.210 --> 24:39.777
ALEX JUST BLEW OFF
OUR DO-OVER DATE.

24:39.779 --> 24:41.111
SAYS HE HAS TO WORK.

24:41.113 --> 24:43.280
WELL, THAT SOUNDS LEGIT.

24:43.282 --> 24:45.216
IT'S NOT. CLUB
IS CLOSED ON MONDAYS.

24:54.494 --> 24:55.893
HI.

24:55.895 --> 24:57.394
HI.

24:57.396 --> 24:58.896
I WAS LOOKING
FOR MR. FITZ.

24:58.898 --> 25:01.732
HE'S NOT IN.
I'M HIS SUB, MISS SHEPARD.

25:01.734 --> 25:03.501
OH, IS HE SICK?

25:03.503 --> 25:06.170
I DON'T KNOW.
IS THERE SOMETHING
I CAN HELP YOU WITH?

25:06.172 --> 25:07.638
THANKS, I CAN--

25:07.640 --> 25:10.808
DO YOU KNOW IF MR. FITZ
WILL BE BACK TOMORROW?

25:10.810 --> 25:12.109
I DON'T.

25:18.618 --> 25:20.684
( period bell rings )

25:27.894 --> 25:29.393
EMILY.

25:31.230 --> 25:32.630
I KNOW YOU'RE THERE.

25:34.100 --> 25:36.033
I'M KIND OF IN A RUSH.

25:36.035 --> 25:38.536
DO YOU HAVE IT?

25:38.538 --> 25:41.572
I-I DON'T, AND NO ONE ELSE
DOES, EITHER.

25:44.243 --> 25:47.611
LISTEN, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT IT ANYMORE, OKAY?

25:47.613 --> 25:51.415
IT'S GONE... FOR GOOD.
NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW.

25:51.417 --> 25:55.052
WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

25:55.054 --> 25:57.555
JUST WHAT I SAID.

25:57.557 --> 25:58.956
IT'S GONE.

26:01.193 --> 26:03.427
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT
LYING TO ME.

26:08.701 --> 26:10.467
( sighs )

26:10.469 --> 26:13.370
( indistinct chatter )

26:18.945 --> 26:22.613
HEY. I GOT A MESSAGE
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME.

26:22.615 --> 26:24.782
FROM THE UNIVERSE?

26:24.784 --> 26:27.117
FROM A POST-IT.

26:27.119 --> 26:29.453
YEAH, I-I JUST WANTED
TO GET YOUR APPROVAL

26:29.455 --> 26:32.523
ON THE HOMECOMING PAGE
FOR THE YEARBOOK.

26:32.525 --> 26:34.558
I THINK I LIKE...
THAT ONE THE BEST.

26:34.560 --> 26:38.128
REALLY? LOOKS LIKE SEAN
ATE A BAD BURRITO.

26:38.130 --> 26:41.165
YEAH... BUT...

26:41.167 --> 26:43.500
I COULD PHOTOSHOP
SOME MAGIC, YOU KNOW,

26:43.502 --> 26:46.003
FIND A SMILE SOMEWHERE.

26:46.005 --> 26:48.639
USE THAT ONE.
IT IS WHAT IT IS.

26:48.641 --> 26:50.507
AT LEAST IT'S REAL.

26:53.713 --> 26:55.245
( sighs )

26:55.247 --> 26:57.181
DAMN, I THOUGHT
I'D LOOK HAPPIER.

27:07.727 --> 27:09.126
SPENCER?

27:09.128 --> 27:10.761
YOU<i> ARE</i> HERE.

27:10.763 --> 27:13.497
YOU THOUGHT
I WAS LYING?

27:13.499 --> 27:14.698
NO!

27:14.700 --> 27:15.866
MAYBE?

27:15.868 --> 27:17.368
YES.

27:17.370 --> 27:20.070
THERE'S SOME
BIG BREAKFAST THING
HERE TOMORROW.

27:20.072 --> 27:23.374
THEY TOLD ME I'D GET
TIME AND A HALF.

27:23.376 --> 27:25.943
WHY ARE YOU LOOKING
AT ME LIKE THAT?

27:25.945 --> 27:27.144
LIKE WHAT?

27:27.146 --> 27:28.946
LIKE I'D RATHER BE
MAKING FRUIT KEBABS

27:28.948 --> 27:30.314
THAN SPENDING TIME
WITH YOU.

27:32.485 --> 27:34.084
I GUESS I'M JUST TRYING
TO FIGURE THIS OUT.

27:35.788 --> 27:40.057
SO, ARE WE... STILL ON
FOR OUR DO-OVER DATE?

27:40.059 --> 27:41.291
YOU OUT OF
HERE, BOSS?

27:41.293 --> 27:42.359
HELL, YES.

27:42.361 --> 27:43.894
WHO'S THIS?

27:43.896 --> 27:46.063
UH, JUST A FRIEND
HELPING OUT.

27:46.065 --> 27:47.498
IS THAT A PROBLEM?

27:47.500 --> 27:49.967
ONLY IF SHE'S MAKING MELON BALLS
WITHOUT A HAIRNET.

27:49.969 --> 27:51.969
SUIT HER UP.

27:51.971 --> 27:55.973
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING,
DON'T CALL ME.

27:55.975 --> 27:58.542
I'LL BE LAYING IN A PUDDLE
OF MY OWN WASTE.

27:58.544 --> 28:00.577
YOU CAN STOP NOW.
HE'S GONE.

28:00.579 --> 28:02.713
WELL, IS ANYONE ELSE
COMING THROUGH?

28:02.715 --> 28:05.182
IF THEY DO, WE'LL HIDE
YOU IN THE MEAT LOCKER.

28:05.184 --> 28:08.919
WHY? THINK I CAN'T HANDLE
STABBING KIWI AND CANTALOUPE?

28:08.921 --> 28:10.587
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

28:10.589 --> 28:12.923
CUTTING YOUR WORKLOAD
IN HALF.

28:12.925 --> 28:16.060
WOW. IF YOUR PARENTS
COULD SEE

28:16.062 --> 28:18.262
THEIR LITTLE GIRL
RIGHT NOW.

28:18.264 --> 28:20.531
MY PARENTS STAY
ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THOSE DOORS, REMEMBER?

28:23.803 --> 28:26.136
COME ON, MOVE YOUR MELON BALLS.
YOU'RE SLOWING ME DOWN.

28:29.208 --> 28:31.075
( period bell rings )

28:31.077 --> 28:32.910
ARIA, WAIT UP.

28:32.912 --> 28:34.278
( sighs )

28:34.280 --> 28:36.780
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR
YOU ALL DAY. DID YOU--?

28:36.782 --> 28:39.516
GET THE FLOWERS? YEAH.
DON'T EVER DO THAT AGAIN.

28:39.518 --> 28:40.951
OH, ARE YOU ALLERGIC?

28:40.953 --> 28:43.187
I'M ONE OF HANNA'S
BEST FRIENDS, SEAN...

28:43.189 --> 28:45.622
THE PERSON YOU SHOULD
BE SENDING FLOWERS TO.

28:45.624 --> 28:46.924
I WAS JUST SAYING
THANKS FOR--

28:46.926 --> 28:49.326
NO, YOU WERE SAYING
"SCREW YOU, HANNA."

28:50.930 --> 28:55.432
OKAY, MAYBE I WAS,
BUT CAN YOU BLAME ME?

28:55.434 --> 28:57.434
SHE MAKES A BIG DEAL
ABOUT GOING TOGETHER,

28:57.436 --> 28:59.002
THEN BAILS.
STOP!

28:59.004 --> 29:03.507
HANNA LOVES YOU,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

29:03.509 --> 29:05.576
SHE HASN'T TALKED ABOUT
ANY OTHER GUY

29:05.578 --> 29:08.011
SINCE THE SEVENTH GRADE,
AND BELIEVE ME,

29:08.013 --> 29:10.814
IT'S BORING HOW MUCH
SHE LOVES YOU.

29:10.816 --> 29:12.483
WHY WOULD YOU
WANT TO HURT HER?

29:12.485 --> 29:13.917
Boy: WHAT DID YOU SAY TO ME?
Mike: YOU HEARD ME.

29:16.322 --> 29:18.856
HEY! MIKE!

29:18.858 --> 29:21.658
MIKE! STOP!

29:21.660 --> 29:23.160
STOP!

29:23.162 --> 29:25.863
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOU?

29:25.865 --> 29:27.397
LEAVE ME ALONE.

29:27.399 --> 29:29.566
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING, MAN?
THAT'S YOUR SISTER.

29:29.568 --> 29:31.068
LET HIM GO, SEAN. MIKE!

29:31.070 --> 29:32.669
JUST GO TO HELL.

29:40.913 --> 29:42.446
( chuckling )

29:42.448 --> 29:44.515
HE'S BEATING HIM?
THAT'S INSANE. IT'S A CAT.

29:44.517 --> 29:46.884
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT
TILL YOU SEE HIS BACKHAND.

29:46.886 --> 29:49.052
OH, OH!

29:49.054 --> 29:50.554
WHO POSTS THIS CRAP?

29:50.556 --> 29:52.556
PEOPLE WHO HAVE
MORE FREE TIME THAN I DO...

29:52.558 --> 29:54.792
WHICH IS HARD TO IMAGINE.

29:54.794 --> 29:57.060
DO YOU WANT TO SEE
A TURKEY ON A SNOWBOARD?

30:06.372 --> 30:08.405
SORRY.

30:08.407 --> 30:10.440
FOR WHAT?

30:10.442 --> 30:13.710
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO, LIKE, YOU KNOW,

30:13.712 --> 30:17.047
INVADE YOUR
PERSONAL... SKIN.

30:17.049 --> 30:19.283
( chuckles ) IT'S OKAY.
THE LEPROSY CLEARED UP.

30:24.089 --> 30:26.190
ARE YOU OKAY?

30:26.192 --> 30:28.859
YEAH. IT'S JUST...

30:31.831 --> 30:35.065
TO BE HONEST, I USED
TO BE SO AFRAID OF YOU.

30:35.067 --> 30:36.733
OF ME?

30:36.735 --> 30:38.435
WELL, NOT YOU SPECIFICALLY,

30:38.437 --> 30:41.738
JUST YOUR WHOLE... POSSE.

30:43.576 --> 30:47.845
YOU KNOW,
ALISON'S... COVEN.

30:47.847 --> 30:49.980
WE WEREN'T WITCHES.

30:49.982 --> 30:54.017
WELL, MAYBE YOU USED
YOUR POWERS FOR GOOD,

30:54.019 --> 30:58.655
BUT... ALISON WAS JUST
STRAIGHT UP EVIL.

31:03.095 --> 31:05.162
SHE CALLED ME
HERMIE THE HERMAPHRODITE

31:05.164 --> 31:06.797
FOR THREE YEARS

31:06.799 --> 31:09.533
JUST BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T
LIKE MY GLASSES.

31:09.535 --> 31:11.201
WELL, YOUR SHOES WEREN'T
THAT GREAT, EITHER.

31:12.905 --> 31:14.404
COME ON, LIGHTEN UP.

31:14.406 --> 31:16.607
ALISON HAD NAMES
FOR EVERYBODY.

31:16.609 --> 31:18.976
SAY HELLO
TO HEFTY HANNA.

31:18.978 --> 31:20.544
SHE CALLED YOU THAT?

31:22.815 --> 31:26.183
WHY WERE YOU FRIENDS
WITH THIS PERSON?

31:26.185 --> 31:28.785
I MEAN, SHE HAD SNAKES
COMING OUT OF HER HEAD.

31:28.787 --> 31:30.921
YEAH, WELL, SHE HAD
ANOTHER SIDE TO HER, TOO.

31:30.923 --> 31:33.290
WHEN SHE WANTED TO,

31:33.292 --> 31:36.693
SHE COULD MAKE SOMEONE
FEEL REALLY SPECIAL.

31:39.865 --> 31:42.866
WOW. THAT'S EXACTLY NOT
HOW SHE MADE ME FEEL.

31:45.704 --> 31:48.305
IS "SNOWBOARDING TURKEY"
HYPHENATED?

31:48.307 --> 31:50.641
( typing )

31:54.914 --> 31:56.413
WHAT SHELF ARE THEY ON?

31:56.415 --> 31:58.348
Alex: CHECK THE BOTTOM ONE
UNDER THE SPONGES.

32:11.497 --> 32:13.196
DID YOU FIND THEM?

32:16.101 --> 32:17.968
GOD, NO, DON'T LOOK AT THAT.

32:17.970 --> 32:20.070
DON'T. W-WHAT IS THIS?

32:20.072 --> 32:22.105
IT'S-- IT'S--
IT'S NOTHING.

32:22.107 --> 32:23.440
IT'S STUPID.

32:23.442 --> 32:25.776
IT'S A PICTURE OF ME
WITH HORNS.

32:25.778 --> 32:27.010
WHO DID THIS?

32:27.012 --> 32:29.346
NOT ME.
IT'S THE BITCH BOARD,

32:29.348 --> 32:31.682
SOMETHING THE STAFF DOES
TO BLOW OFF STEAM.

32:31.684 --> 32:34.685
WHEN A CLUB MEMBER'S
RUDE TO ONE OF US,
WE KEEP A RUNNING TAB.

32:34.687 --> 32:36.420
AND I MADE THE CUT?

32:36.422 --> 32:38.789
SPENCER, I'VE NEVER
SEEN YOUR PICTURE

32:38.791 --> 32:40.090
THERE BEFORE, I SWEAR.

32:41.961 --> 32:43.860
SO THIS IS HOW EVERYONE
WHO WORKS HERE SEES ME.

32:47.132 --> 32:48.465
WOW.

32:48.467 --> 32:50.367
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
SPENCER.

32:50.369 --> 32:53.136
YOUR SISTER
TOOK ONE LOOK AT ME
AT HOMECOMING

32:53.138 --> 32:55.072
AND THOUGHT I WAS THERE
TO PARK HER CAR.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.141
PEOPLE ACT LIKE THIS.

32:58.143 --> 33:00.677
IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF YOU'RE QUEEN BEES
OR WORKER BEES.

33:14.293 --> 33:17.461
HEY. I KNOW YOU DON'T
WANT TO TALK TO ME,

33:17.463 --> 33:20.063
BUT COULD YOU AT LEAST
LISTEN TO ME FOR A SEC?

33:22.701 --> 33:24.901
I WANTED TO GIVE YOU
A HEADS-UP.

33:24.903 --> 33:28.405
THAT PICTURE
OF YOU AND ME KISSING?

33:28.407 --> 33:30.841
IT'S PROBABLY GONNA BE SEEN
BY A LOT OF PEOPLE.

33:30.843 --> 33:35.479
I WON'T LOSE SLEEP.
THAT'S YOU, NOT ME.

33:35.481 --> 33:37.948
I'M NOT GONNA LOSE
ANY MORE SLEEP, EITHER.

33:39.585 --> 33:42.719
I MISS YOU... AND...

33:42.721 --> 33:44.388
AND?

33:44.390 --> 33:46.556
AND I WANT TO TRY
TO MAKE THIS WORK.

33:48.394 --> 33:52.396
WOW. WHEN DID
THIS HAPPEN?

33:52.398 --> 33:54.231
THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU

33:54.233 --> 33:57.100
YOU WERE SLOW-DANCING
WITH TOBY AT HOMECOMING.

33:59.805 --> 34:01.304
MAYA...

34:01.306 --> 34:03.340
CAN WE JUST TALK
ABOUT YOU AND ME?

34:03.342 --> 34:06.009
HOW DO I KNOW YOU WON'T
FLAKE ON ME AGAIN?

34:07.913 --> 34:09.679
BECAUSE I'M TRYING
THIS NEW THING

34:09.681 --> 34:11.882
CALLED BEING HONEST
WITH MYSELF.

34:14.053 --> 34:16.053
HOW AM I DOING SO FAR?

34:17.856 --> 34:18.989
DECENT.

34:22.361 --> 34:26.563
ELLA. ELLA.
ELLA, SLOW DOWN.

34:26.565 --> 34:27.798
ELLA, LISTEN.

34:27.800 --> 34:29.299
DO YOU WANT
TO GO SOMEWHERE

34:29.301 --> 34:31.568
AND FIGURE OUT
HOW WE'RE GONNA DEAL
WITH THIS?

34:31.570 --> 34:33.003
DEAL WITH WHAT?

34:33.005 --> 34:34.771
MIKE HAS NEVER PICKED
A FIGHT BEFORE IN HIS LIFE.

34:34.773 --> 34:37.541
WELL, I GUESS THERE'S
A FIRST TIME FOR EVERYTHING.

34:37.543 --> 34:40.510
DID YOU KNOW THAT ARIA
HAD BEEN SKIPPING
HER CLASSES?

34:40.512 --> 34:42.412
DID I KNOW?

34:42.414 --> 34:46.083
AS IN, AM I NOT KEEPING
CLOSE ENOUGH TABS
ON OUR CHILDREN?

34:46.085 --> 34:48.785
NO, I'M NOT--
OR MAYBE I'M JUST
TOO TRUSTING.

34:48.787 --> 34:50.821
NO, I AM NOT
BEING CRITICAL, OKAY?

34:50.823 --> 34:52.823
I'M JUST SAYING THAT I
THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE

34:52.825 --> 34:54.724
PUTTING THE FOCUS ON
THEM RIGHT NOW, NOT US.

34:54.726 --> 34:55.926
WE MADE A DECISION.

34:55.928 --> 34:57.494
YEAH, AND THAT WAS
BEFORE OUR KIDS

34:57.496 --> 34:59.196
STARTED SPINNING
OUT OF CONTROL.

34:59.198 --> 35:00.931
OKAY, LOOK, I'M NOT
MOVING OUT NOW.

35:00.933 --> 35:02.099
THEY NEED US.

35:02.101 --> 35:03.633
YOU DON'T GET
TO PLAY MR. MORAL

35:03.635 --> 35:06.303
WHEN YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
THREW THIS FAMILY INTO CHAOS.

35:06.305 --> 35:08.839
THEY'LL GET THROUGH THIS.
THEY'RE ANGRY AND CONFUSED

35:08.841 --> 35:10.674
BECAUSE WE'RE ANGRY
AND CONFUSED.

35:10.676 --> 35:12.242
THE SOONER WE SORT THIS OUT,

35:12.244 --> 35:14.578
THE SOONER THEY WILL FEEL LIKE
THEY CAN RELY ON US AGAIN.

35:14.580 --> 35:16.413
WELL, THEY CAN
RELY ON US.

35:16.415 --> 35:18.515
MAYBE. SOMEDAY.

35:18.517 --> 35:20.117
BUT IT'S NOT GONNA
HELP THEM TO PRETEND

35:20.119 --> 35:22.085
LIKE EVERYTHING IS FINE
BETWEEN US, BECAUSE IT'S NOT.

35:22.087 --> 35:24.588
YOU'RE NOT MY CHILD,
YOU'RE NOT MY ROOMMATE,

35:24.590 --> 35:27.023
AND YOU CAN'T SLEEP
ON A COUCH IN THE DEN

35:27.025 --> 35:28.358
LIKE SOME DRUNK UNCLE.

35:28.360 --> 35:29.926
WELL, I DON'T WANT
TO LEAVE.

35:29.928 --> 35:31.928
WELL, I DON'T WANT
YOU TO STAY.

35:39.104 --> 35:40.103
<i> Aria: EZRA?</i>

35:42.107 --> 35:43.106
EZRA?

36:01.660 --> 36:04.227

36:10.102 --> 36:11.368
EZRA?

36:11.370 --> 36:14.171

36:17.342 --> 36:19.676

36:40.933 --> 36:42.799
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

36:42.801 --> 36:45.335
I COPIED DOWN
YOUR READING ASSIGNMENT.

36:45.337 --> 36:47.137
IT'S IN MY BAG.

36:47.139 --> 36:49.573
YOU BROUGHT ME
MY HOMEWORK?

36:49.575 --> 36:51.007
YEAH.

36:51.009 --> 36:52.976
HEARD YOU WEREN'T
IN ENGLISH TODAY.

36:52.978 --> 36:56.146
SUB. JUST WASN'T
FEELING IT.

36:56.148 --> 36:58.348
SO, YOU'RE
NOT MAD AT ME?

36:58.350 --> 37:00.584
WHAT, FOR DITCHING ENGLISH?

37:00.586 --> 37:02.719
FOR DITCHING YOU
AT HOMECOMING.

37:02.721 --> 37:05.622
NAH. I'M OVER IT.

37:07.326 --> 37:09.159
WE'RE NOT THE FIRST
KING AND QUEEN

37:09.161 --> 37:10.060
TO HAVE A FIGHT,
HANNA BANANA.

37:13.699 --> 37:15.999
WHAT ARE YOU
WORKING ON? BIOLOGY?

37:16.001 --> 37:18.335
NO. NO, NO, NO,
YOU HAVE TO WATCH THIS.

37:18.337 --> 37:19.970
YOU'LL LOVE IT.

37:26.545 --> 37:28.044
NO, KEEP WATCHING
THE TURKEY.

37:28.046 --> 37:29.279
THERE'S A HALF-PIPE
COMING UP.

37:33.619 --> 37:35.619
THAT IS SO NOT REAL.

37:35.621 --> 37:38.255
IT'S JUST DUMB.

37:38.257 --> 37:40.290
WHY DON'T YOU PUT
SOME MUSIC ON?

37:41.893 --> 37:42.892
SURE.

MIKE!

40:02.534 --> 40:04.534
WHAT?

40:04.536 --> 40:07.036
NO, NOT "WHAT."
TALK TO ME.

40:07.038 --> 40:09.172
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON?

40:09.174 --> 40:10.507
YOU SAY GOOD-BYE?

40:14.379 --> 40:16.913
MAYBE THEY KNOW

40:16.915 --> 40:18.248
MAYBE...

40:19.918 --> 40:23.052
MAYBE THIS IS THE BEST THING
FOR EVERYONE RIGHT NOW.

40:23.054 --> 40:25.588
( scoffs )
HEY!

40:25.590 --> 40:27.757
THE NEXT TIME YOU
WANNA TAKE A SWING

40:27.759 --> 40:29.793
AT ONE OF US,
USE A PILLOW.

40:29.795 --> 40:31.528
DON'T GO AFTER KIDS
TWICE YOUR SIZE.

40:31.530 --> 40:34.164
I AM NOT THINKING
ABOUT MOM AND DAD.

40:36.535 --> 40:38.468
WHY SHOULD I CARE
ABOUT THEM?

40:38.470 --> 40:40.837
THEY DON'T EVEN CARE
ABOUT US.

40:40.839 --> 40:42.605
MIKE...

<i> Ella: SO, ON THURSDAY...</i>

AND THE, UH, SCHOOL'S
ART FAIR IS--

40:52.517 --> 40:53.883
IS THIS SATURDAY.

40:56.254 --> 40:58.521
I SIGNED US UP
FOR BEVERAGES.

40:58.523 --> 41:00.190
GOT IT.

41:00.192 --> 41:01.591
OKAY, THEN.

41:05.397 --> 41:07.363
WE'LL TALK.

41:23.148 --> 41:24.814
SO, IS TOBY DEAD?

41:24.816 --> 41:28.051
I COULDN'T BRING
MYSELF TO ASK.

41:28.053 --> 41:30.253
JENNA WAS SO UPSET.

41:31.756 --> 41:33.356
BUT HIS BIKE...

41:35.760 --> 41:37.527
IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS...

41:38.864 --> 41:40.129
LIKE IT WAS WRECKED.

41:42.534 --> 41:45.168
WELL, I'M NOT GONNA
CRY OVER THIS,

41:45.170 --> 41:47.070
AND NEITHER
SHOULD YOU.

41:47.072 --> 41:50.273
SPENCER, IF SHE LIKED HIM
SHE CAN CRY ABOUT IT.

41:50.275 --> 41:51.841
WELL, I'M SORRY
FOR SPEAKING.

41:57.983 --> 41:59.983
LOOK, SHE'S RIGHT. I--

41:59.985 --> 42:01.851
I CAN'T TELL YOU
WHAT TO FEEL.

42:04.289 --> 42:07.257
I'M SORRY FOR WHAT I SAID
ABOUT YOUR FAMILY YESTERDAY.

42:07.259 --> 42:08.525
I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

42:09.895 --> 42:11.327
IT'S TRUE.

42:12.764 --> 42:14.797
YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST PERSON
TO THINK IT.

42:14.799 --> 42:18.134
( cell phone beeping )

42:18.136 --> 42:20.103
IT'S PROBABLY ARIA.

42:20.105 --> 42:21.905
SOMETHING WEIRD'S
GOING DOWN AT HER HOUSE.

42:25.844 --> 42:27.076
WHAT IS IT?

42:29.948 --> 42:33.349
"THANKS FOR GETTING TOBY
OUT OF MY WAY. 'A.'"
