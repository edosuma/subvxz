Sync JustJohnDoe

00:51.620 --> 00:53.770
We're almost a
month into the strike,

00:53.780 --> 00:55.405
and we've got millions of kids
stuck home from school.

00:55.415 --> 00:57.490
Do you blame
the White House or Congress?

00:57.500 --> 00:59.445
I personally have very
little sympathy for the teachers.

00:59.455 --> 01:01.930
We're over three weeks
into this strike.

01:01.940 --> 01:03.405
It's costing the country
billions of dollars,

01:03.415 --> 01:04.765
and instead
of offering solutions-

01:04.775 --> 01:06.330
There's a big difference

01:06.340 --> 01:08.205
between taking a stand
and sitting on your hands.

01:08.215 --> 01:09.885
I don't know whether
to call it cowardice...

01:09.895 --> 01:11.730
It's his agenda,
and the problem

01:11.740 --> 01:14.130
is that he stole sound,
conservative ideas.

01:14.140 --> 01:18.005
The only smart thing he's done is lift his
platform from the republican platform.

01:18.015 --> 01:19.930
I admit it, Linda.
This got away from me.

01:19.940 --> 01:22.765
But we can't turn back time.
We have to hold our ground.

01:22.775 --> 01:25.050
While our approval ratings
continue to nosedive?

01:25.060 --> 01:28.365
Spinella and I worked together for years
on dozens of labor-related bills.

01:28.375 --> 01:30.302
- I thought he'd be reasonable.
- You were wrong about that.

01:30.312 --> 01:32.205
Well, I didn't think he'd be
insane enough to go on strike,

01:32.215 --> 01:33.845
and I didn't think the strike
would last this long.

01:33.855 --> 01:35.450
So you've been wrong
twice about this.

01:35.460 --> 01:37.005
Why should I believe
you're right about holding out?

01:37.015 --> 01:38.730
We threatened
collective bargaining

01:38.740 --> 01:41.005
in order to get performance
standards and charter funding.

01:41.015 --> 01:43.125
That's the deal that we made.
We took that stand.

01:43.135 --> 01:45.370
We lay down now,
we lose it all.

01:45.380 --> 01:47.290
There'll be no reform,
just an empty bill.

01:47.300 --> 01:51.205
I understand the logic, Frank,
but we're in damage control now.

01:51.215 --> 01:53.045
We can't close one wound
by opening another.

01:53.055 --> 01:54.730
But we're the democrats.

01:54.740 --> 01:56.485
We're the ones who are supposed
to be defending the teachers.

01:56.495 --> 01:57.885
But you can't have it
both ways, Linda.

01:57.895 --> 01:59.650
You can't have the reform
you want

01:59.660 --> 02:01.925
and keep the teachers happy
at the same time.

02:01.935 --> 02:03.162
You knew that when we started.

02:03.172 --> 02:04.330
Okay,
then if we have to choose,

02:04.340 --> 02:06.210
we choose to keep
the teachers happy.

02:06.220 --> 02:08.345
That is a mistake, Linda.
We've already crossed the rubicon.

02:08.354 --> 02:10.445
I'm telling you this- the president
wants to change the bill.

02:10.455 --> 02:12.605
We should've done it
three weeks ago. We didn't.

02:12.615 --> 02:13.850
So you have to do it now.

02:13.860 --> 02:15.810
Give me more time,
Linda, please.

02:15.820 --> 02:19.205
If I can break this strike and get
everything we want in this bill,

02:19.215 --> 02:21.445
can we agree that's preferable
to folding?

02:21.455 --> 02:22.890
Of course.
If we can count on that-

02:22.900 --> 02:24.690
Then count on me
for just one more week.

02:24.700 --> 02:27.125
If the strike isn't over
by then, I'll change the bill.

02:27.135 --> 02:31.335
- Frank-
- No. One more week. That's all.

02:33.220 --> 02:35.570
This is the worst
possible position to be in.

02:35.580 --> 02:38.505
If I water down the bill, the
president will still see me as a failure.

02:38.515 --> 02:41.405
If the strike doesn't end in a week,
I forced myself into a corner.

02:41.415 --> 02:44.765
Only total victory will put
me back in his good graces.

02:44.775 --> 02:46.330
The alternative is exile,

02:46.340 --> 02:48.365
which would mean the last
five months were for nothing.

02:48.375 --> 02:52.675
I cannot abide
falling back to square one.

04:26.860 --> 04:28.490
You need me, ma'am?

04:28.500 --> 04:31.525
No. I just was wondering
if you wanted a cup of coffee.

04:31.535 --> 04:32.970
I just brewed a fresh pot.

04:32.980 --> 04:35.565
- I'm good, ma'am. But thanks.
- Are you sure?

04:35.575 --> 04:38.125
My shift's done in a couple hours.
I'll be fine.

04:38.135 --> 04:39.922
No. Come on.
Stretch your legs.

04:39.932 --> 04:42.932
I won't take no for an answer.

04:45.660 --> 04:48.725
What did you do before you
joined the leadership detail?

04:48.735 --> 04:50.450
I was a cop here in DC.

04:50.460 --> 04:53.085
Before that,
I was in the Marines, ma'am.

04:53.095 --> 04:56.022
- Thank you.
- Did you serve overseas?

04:56.032 --> 04:58.890
I did, ma'am.
Bahrain, then Afghanistan.

04:58.900 --> 05:04.300
Served most of my second tour
in the Korangal Valley.

05:04.420 --> 05:06.965
You wanna know
if I killed anyone?

05:06.975 --> 05:09.210
I think I know the answer.

05:09.220 --> 05:12.645
- I got a dinner meeting with birch.
- I invited him in for coffee.

05:12.655 --> 05:15.902
Well, drink it fast. We leave in five...

05:15.912 --> 05:19.712
Get down! Stay away
from the windows!

05:29.460 --> 05:29.960
Stop!

05:41.300 --> 05:43.485
You'll have six of my best men
covering you around the clock.

05:43.495 --> 05:45.805
I guess I'm wondering why
we didn't at least have

05:45.815 --> 05:47.805
one of your best men
covering us now.

05:47.815 --> 05:49.410
He'll be disciplined, sir.

05:49.420 --> 05:51.650
He shot a gun
in a residential neighborhood.

05:51.660 --> 05:53.845
- I want him fired.
- There will be a full investigation,

05:53.855 --> 05:55.962
and we'll take
the necessary action.

05:55.972 --> 05:58.010
Steve never would've
let this happen.

05:58.020 --> 06:01.525
Is he better yet? Because I would
feel a lot safer if he was with us.

06:01.535 --> 06:04.362
Unfortunately,
he won't be coming back, sir.

06:04.372 --> 06:07.165
I thought he just had
a gallbladder infection.

06:07.175 --> 06:09.362
He did, but they found more.

06:09.372 --> 06:11.490
His pancreas, stage four.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.165
- Jesus.
- Oh, my God. That's awful.

06:13.175 --> 06:14.605
How much longer does he have?

06:14.615 --> 06:16.370
Not long.
A few weeks.

06:16.380 --> 06:18.290
At least that's what
his wife told me.

06:18.300 --> 06:20.925
We have to go see him.
Can you get the information where he is?

06:20.935 --> 06:22.605
Of course. I'll make sure
you get it right away.

06:22.615 --> 06:24.165
- Thank you, Captain.
- Thank you.

06:24.175 --> 06:26.902
You're welcome.
Good night.

06:26.912 --> 06:29.512
- Front door.
- Yes, sir.

06:29.615 --> 06:30.815
Your weapon.

06:35.660 --> 06:36.730
Your badge too.

06:36.740 --> 06:38.740
Am I suspended, sir?

06:38.900 --> 06:42.130
You had a suspect on foot,
and you fire your gun?

06:42.140 --> 06:44.045
- Sir, I realize that-
- Do you know how this reflects on me?

06:44.055 --> 06:46.250
That one of our men
could be so careless?

06:46.260 --> 06:49.085
Not only do you abandon
your post for coffee...

06:49.095 --> 06:51.770
You could've
killed a bystander.

06:51.780 --> 06:53.845
That slug was found
in somebody's front stoop.

06:53.855 --> 06:56.955
What if it went in their house?

06:57.140 --> 06:59.140
Your badge, Meechum.

07:03.580 --> 07:06.125
Two reasons, which are
really the same reason.

07:06.135 --> 07:07.970
I was sick of working
for other people,

07:07.980 --> 07:10.185
and I knew I could do
a better job than my bosses.

07:10.195 --> 07:12.365
They kept trying to suppress me,
shutting me out.

07:12.375 --> 07:14.582
So I said, "fuck it.
I'll do it my way."

07:14.592 --> 07:16.730
- Then you just quit?
- Not like you did.

07:16.740 --> 07:19.845
I slaved away until I lined up
the money to start Slugline.

07:19.855 --> 07:23.285
Once Slugline gets big enough,
what's the plan?

07:23.295 --> 07:24.965
Are you gonna sell it
like Arianna?

07:24.975 --> 07:26.490
Probably.
And then who knows?

07:26.500 --> 07:29.025
Whatever the next adventure is.
Maybe Shanghai.

07:29.035 --> 07:33.090
So I shouldn't expect
to have a job in two years?

07:33.100 --> 07:37.010
Do you ever wanna have
any job for more than two years?

07:37.020 --> 07:39.245
What about you?
What's your big plan?

07:39.255 --> 07:41.355
Uh, I don't know yet.

07:41.780 --> 07:46.730
Come on. Slugline is just
a stepping stone for you.

07:46.740 --> 07:50.405
- You know what? I should take this.
- Go. Do your thing.

07:50.415 --> 07:52.410
Hey. You have proof Spinella
was behind it?

07:52.420 --> 07:54.685
Put it in context. Three weeks
into a national teachers' strike-

07:54.695 --> 07:56.890
At the home of Francis Underwood,
who has led the charge on-

07:56.900 --> 08:00.885
There you go. Now post that before one of
my neighbors calls a local 11:00 hack.

08:00.895 --> 08:04.285
- When do I see you next? - I'm background
on this. I'm not your source.

08:04.295 --> 08:05.365
You can't talk now?

08:05.375 --> 08:06.450
- No.
- When?

08:06.460 --> 08:08.010
Soon, with bells on.

08:08.020 --> 08:11.130
What about "more school books,
less bricks"?

08:11.140 --> 08:14.010
Nah, it's too broad.
We need a better sound bite.

08:14.020 --> 08:18.085
Something specific, something that
points the finger directly at Spinella.

08:18.095 --> 08:20.090
- He'll deny any involvement.
- Of course he will.

08:20.100 --> 08:22.805
- So how do we get around that?
- We say he can't control his troops.

08:22.815 --> 08:25.805
- There's no evidence it was a teacher.
- Who else could it be?

08:25.815 --> 08:28.365
He's gonna shift blame for
the strike back on congress.

08:28.375 --> 08:30.925
No. We need something clear,
something clean,

08:30.935 --> 08:33.409
something that sticks
in your head.

08:33.419 --> 08:35.570
"Teachers need a lesson
in self-restraint."

08:35.580 --> 08:38.690
No. You're not hearing me.
People like teachers.

08:38.700 --> 08:41.210
No. We need something
that makes Spinella the villain.

08:41.220 --> 08:47.090
- His lack of control, his inability-
- Disorganized labor.

08:47.100 --> 08:50.005
It's disorganized labor,
plain and simple.

08:50.015 --> 08:51.410
When you've got angry teachers

08:51.420 --> 08:53.565
throwing bricks
through congressmen's windows,

08:53.575 --> 08:55.330
you've gotta blame
the union leadership.

08:55.340 --> 08:58.485
We'll be beefing up the security
for the entire leadership.

08:58.495 --> 09:01.205
And I strongly encourage
Marty Spinella

09:01.215 --> 09:02.690
to keep his people in line.

09:02.700 --> 09:05.305
This is starting to look
like disorganized labor.

09:05.315 --> 09:07.952
Do you really think
Marty Spinella is to blame?

09:07.962 --> 09:10.565
Whether Mr. Spinella
is behind this or not,

09:10.575 --> 09:12.250
he might wanna
tone down the rhetoric

09:12.260 --> 09:15.770
before disorganized labor
turns into organized crime.

09:15.780 --> 09:18.945
No one can prove anything.
So that's the most cogent response.

09:18.955 --> 09:22.085
Well, go on TV and say that.
You deplore violence in any form.

09:22.095 --> 09:24.122
It's congress that should
take responsibility.

09:24.132 --> 09:26.090
I don't want to degenerate
to Frank's level.

09:26.100 --> 09:29.005
We need to kill this brick thing.
It's distracting people from the issues.

09:29.015 --> 09:32.005
She's right. It'll eat up one
cycle, and it'll disappear.

09:32.015 --> 09:33.962
No. This story
is getting traction.

09:33.972 --> 09:35.850
Support for the strike
is dipping.

09:35.860 --> 09:37.970
So is the president's
approval ratings.

09:37.980 --> 09:40.165
But he gets to say in the oval office
another three years, no matter what.

09:40.175 --> 09:41.642
We can't afford
another three weeks.

09:41.652 --> 09:43.050
When I told
the unions to strike,

09:43.060 --> 09:44.770
I told them to prepare
for the long haul.

09:44.780 --> 09:47.090
All right? Their accounts
dry up, we keep going.

09:47.100 --> 09:50.405
We figure it out. I am not going
to blink over something like this.

09:50.415 --> 09:53.005
Fine. But if we lose
the public relations battle,

09:53.015 --> 09:54.942
none of that does us any good.

09:54.952 --> 09:56.810
Frank wants us on the defensive.

09:56.820 --> 09:58.805
I think this story
is going to blow over.

09:58.815 --> 10:00.810
If I'm wrong, we'll reevaluate.

10:00.820 --> 10:06.020
But I wanna give it
another day or two first. Okay?

10:34.620 --> 10:35.520
Hi, Adam.

10:36.340 --> 10:39.405
You all right?
I saw the news.

10:39.415 --> 10:40.815
Yes, I'm fine.

10:40.860 --> 10:42.605
That's gotta rattle
the nerves-

10:42.615 --> 10:44.325
A brick
coming through the window.

10:44.335 --> 10:45.635
It did, some.

10:47.700 --> 10:50.645
So are you staying
in the house?

10:50.655 --> 10:53.602
We've got extra security
now, so...

10:53.612 --> 10:56.441
Well, um, it made me
think of you,

10:56.451 --> 10:59.551
so I figured I'd just check in.

11:00.100 --> 11:01.900
I appreciate that.

11:02.020 --> 11:05.420
We still haven't talked,
have we?

11:05.940 --> 11:08.045
- There's no need to.
- I think we should.

11:08.055 --> 11:09.770
Here's how I see it.

11:09.780 --> 11:12.770
You asked me to come down.
I did.

11:12.780 --> 11:17.045
We both had ideas
about what that could mean.

11:17.055 --> 11:19.582
Probably very similar ideas.

11:19.592 --> 11:22.085
But then you changed your mind.

11:22.095 --> 11:22.995
So be it.

11:24.220 --> 11:25.610
There's no reason

11:25.620 --> 11:29.485
we can't be in touch
or remain friends.

11:29.495 --> 11:31.965
Let's not fool ourselves, Adam.

11:31.975 --> 11:33.370
So I won't call again.

11:33.380 --> 11:35.485
- Done.
- I'm not saying that.

11:35.495 --> 11:37.495
What are you saying?

11:38.940 --> 11:42.940
I just called
because I care about you.

11:43.495 --> 11:44.495
No agenda.

11:44.860 --> 11:47.345
If you wanna talk again,
call me.

11:47.355 --> 11:49.392
If not, I understand.
It's up to you.

11:49.402 --> 11:51.370
You think
I'm being unreasonable?

11:51.380 --> 11:54.445
I think you're doing
whatever it is you need to do,

11:54.455 --> 11:56.562
and I'm not gonna question it.

11:56.572 --> 11:58.610
It was sweet of you to call.

11:58.620 --> 12:01.045
Listen, you probably
need to get back to work.

12:01.055 --> 12:03.655
I know I do.
I should go.

12:04.575 --> 12:05.675
Yeah. Okay.

12:05.820 --> 12:07.920
- Take care.
- Okay.

12:19.740 --> 12:24.740
- Frank, you got a minute?
- I'll see you inside.

12:26.420 --> 12:29.325
I wanna be governor,
and I want your help.

12:29.335 --> 12:32.170
- Am I still on the short list?
- You are.

12:32.180 --> 12:36.130
I haven't had a drink
in over a month. I'm clean.

12:36.140 --> 12:38.425
Is that because I asked,
or because it's what you want?

12:38.435 --> 12:41.212
It was about time I took
responsibility for myself.

12:41.222 --> 12:43.930
Taking responsibility is one
thing, and it's admirable.

12:43.940 --> 12:46.525
But running for governor of a major
state is a whole other ball game.

12:46.535 --> 12:47.885
Let me tell you something,
Frank.

12:47.895 --> 12:49.370
I got elected to congress

12:49.380 --> 12:51.530
'cause I seized the moment
that opportunity struck.

12:51.540 --> 12:54.965
You kept me on that list.
I wanna seize that opportunity.

12:54.975 --> 12:58.005
If you help me out,
I'll give you everything I got.

12:58.015 --> 12:59.965
Well, that's all
I've been waiting to hear.

12:59.975 --> 13:02.250
All right.
I'll tell you what.

13:02.260 --> 13:03.805
I need to make some calls,
check in with some people.

13:03.815 --> 13:05.365
Give me a few days.
I'll get back to you.

13:05.375 --> 13:08.130
- Of course.
- And, Peter...

13:08.140 --> 13:10.205
I feel like I've met
the real you

13:10.215 --> 13:13.015
for the first time just now.

13:35.660 --> 13:36.260
Janet.

13:39.060 --> 13:41.565
- Is this a bad time?
- No.

13:41.575 --> 13:42.890
No, not at all.

13:42.900 --> 13:45.005
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were coming.

13:45.015 --> 13:46.690
Here. Take my chair.

13:46.700 --> 13:49.405
- Oh, no. I'm fine.
- I'll take these.

13:49.415 --> 13:50.415
Thank you.

13:52.340 --> 13:54.640
- Hello, Steve.
- Hey.

13:55.500 --> 14:00.300
These could use some water.
I'll be right back.

14:00.980 --> 14:04.405
Francis and I were so upset
when we heard.

14:04.415 --> 14:06.890
I'm sorry I haven't come sooner.

14:06.900 --> 14:09.165
I didn't want
too many people knowing.

14:09.175 --> 14:09.575
Yes.

14:11.100 --> 14:12.850
Francis wishes he could be here.

14:12.860 --> 14:15.530
He wants you to know
he's praying for you.

14:15.540 --> 14:19.565
- Couldn't make it, huh? - No, there's a
big teachers' strike going on right now,

14:19.575 --> 14:22.885
and he's been stuck
in his office for weeks.

14:22.895 --> 14:24.845
I get it.
I saw on the news.

14:24.855 --> 14:27.055
- The brick.
- Right.

14:28.460 --> 14:33.325
I told Francis that probably wouldn't have
happened if you were there.

14:33.335 --> 14:35.035
No. Probably not.

14:41.100 --> 14:43.300
I never seen him pray.

14:44.155 --> 14:46.055
Not in eight years.

14:48.820 --> 14:51.920
You said he was praying for me.

14:55.740 --> 14:57.925
You've seen us in church.

14:57.935 --> 14:59.135
Yeah, but...

14:59.580 --> 15:01.580
I never went inside.

15:05.220 --> 15:06.570
They're just gorgeous.

15:06.580 --> 15:08.605
Mrs. Underwood,
thank you so much.

15:08.615 --> 15:10.690
Please, call me Claire.

15:10.700 --> 15:12.930
- I know you got things to do.
- Of course.

15:12.940 --> 15:16.745
If you need anything at all,
call me. You have my cell.

15:16.755 --> 15:20.525
Anything at all. And I'm sorry
to have surprised you.

15:20.535 --> 15:23.170
No. It was so nice of you
to come.

15:23.180 --> 15:27.180
Thank you.
I know Steve appreciated it.

15:27.700 --> 15:29.200
Check this out.

15:34.780 --> 15:35.780
It's foam.

15:36.380 --> 15:39.605
- How many of these we have?
- 200. But I can get more.

15:39.615 --> 15:40.515
Get more.

15:47.900 --> 15:49.100
Bring it on!

15:50.180 --> 15:55.780
You need to give the teachers
the respect they deserve.

16:08.660 --> 16:11.290
We can't back
away from this, Marty.

16:11.300 --> 16:13.810
- We've gotta face it head-on.
- They provoked us.

16:13.820 --> 16:16.085
They were throwing foam.
Our guys were throwing punches.

16:16.095 --> 16:17.605
We're gonna come off
the bad guys here.

16:17.615 --> 16:20.262
Okay. Okay.
I get it. I get it.

16:20.272 --> 16:22.850
But I wanna be smart about this.

16:22.860 --> 16:25.765
I wanna do something definitive
that'll put this to bed

16:25.775 --> 16:27.765
- and get us back on message.
- CNN,

16:27.775 --> 16:30.005
one on one, you and Underwood.

16:30.015 --> 16:31.250
8:00 tonight.

16:31.260 --> 16:32.970
Frank is excellent in debates.

16:32.980 --> 16:35.685
Go strong against him.
Address the brick right to his face.

16:35.695 --> 16:39.002
- End of story.
- Underwood says he's in if you are.

16:39.012 --> 16:42.285
Okay. But I want as much prep
as possible, okay?

16:42.295 --> 16:43.530
I want to run questions.

16:43.540 --> 16:46.085
You moderate,
you play Underwood.

16:46.095 --> 16:47.495
Wear this one.

16:51.500 --> 16:53.545
Then come in here.
I wanna put powder on you.

16:53.555 --> 16:55.530
Well, somebody at the studio
can do that.

16:55.540 --> 16:58.845
Yes, and they always cake on too much.
I'm doing it.

16:58.855 --> 16:59.855
War paint.

17:01.500 --> 17:03.610
How bloody do you think
it'll be?

17:03.620 --> 17:07.885
Oh, I think I oughta be able to
dispatch with him easily enough.

17:07.895 --> 17:10.210
Oh, you remember Peter Russo?

17:10.220 --> 17:12.885
He's doing well.
He hasn't had a drink in a month.

17:12.895 --> 17:14.810
Oh, good for him.
I like him.

17:14.819 --> 17:16.845
Oh, good,
because he could use your help.

17:16.855 --> 17:18.845
- How?
- We're running him for Governor.

17:18.855 --> 17:20.855
- Ambitious.
- Mmm.

17:21.099 --> 17:23.365
We wanna create jobs
in his district.

17:23.375 --> 17:25.130
It's on the Delaware River.

17:25.140 --> 17:27.645
I thought we might be able
to put a bill together.

17:27.655 --> 17:29.650
Something with
an economic upside.

17:29.660 --> 17:31.490
This has to do
with the shipyard closing?

17:31.500 --> 17:34.885
We need the shipbuilders'
support for his campaign.

17:34.895 --> 17:36.010
You think you might be able

17:36.020 --> 17:37.970
to draft a bill
that he can sponsor?

17:37.980 --> 17:41.165
I'm really trying to focus on
international projects, Francis.

17:41.175 --> 17:42.650
Not domestic legislation.

17:42.660 --> 17:45.245
I understand, but I could really
use your help, Claire.

17:45.255 --> 17:47.690
Does Catherine durant
still owe us?

17:47.700 --> 17:49.245
When you make someone
Secretary of State,

17:49.255 --> 17:50.690
they owe you for life.

17:50.700 --> 17:52.165
We're having trouble
getting our water filters

17:52.175 --> 17:53.610
through sudanese customs.

17:53.620 --> 17:56.045
- I'll call from the car.
- Tomorrow's fine.

17:56.055 --> 17:58.445
- I would have done that anyway.
- I know.

17:58.455 --> 17:59.922
I'm ready for battle.

17:59.932 --> 18:01.330
You wanna come watch?

18:01.340 --> 18:04.170
- No. You go on ahead.
- Oh, come on.

18:04.180 --> 18:06.125
Watch me put the final nail
in Spinella's coffin.

18:06.135 --> 18:07.435
It'll be fun.

18:11.940 --> 18:12.540
Marty.

18:14.235 --> 18:14.835
Frank.

18:20.940 --> 18:24.340
Come on, people.
Take your marks.

18:25.900 --> 18:27.970
Congressman, would
you like to respond to that?

18:27.980 --> 18:32.525
Yes, I would. Two billion dollars
of taxpayer's money being wasted.

18:32.535 --> 18:35.282
And congress should be ashamed
of itself for that, Frank.

18:35.292 --> 18:38.005
Oh, what? Did congress force
the teachers to go on strike?

18:38.015 --> 18:39.782
- No, we didn't.
- Really, Frank?

18:39.792 --> 18:41.525
When you threaten
teachers' ability

18:41.535 --> 18:42.850
to negotiate as a union,

18:42.860 --> 18:44.845
when you threaten
their job security,

18:44.855 --> 18:46.290
you threaten their livelihood,

18:46.300 --> 18:48.290
of course you force them
to strike.

18:48.300 --> 18:51.325
And did we also force them to start
throwing bricks at people's houses?

18:51.335 --> 18:52.810
I'm really glad
you brought that up,

18:52.820 --> 18:55.610
because you know
there's absolutely no proof

18:55.620 --> 18:58.045
that that incident had
anything to do with this strike.

18:58.055 --> 19:00.485
And I wanna take the opportunity
to say publicly

19:00.495 --> 19:01.970
that we categorically condemn

19:01.980 --> 19:04.325
any use of violence whatsoever
or intimidation.

19:04.335 --> 19:05.730
What you're saying essentially

19:05.740 --> 19:08.090
is that you can't control
your own people.

19:08.100 --> 19:10.485
- That is not what I'm saying. - That is
what you're saying. You're disorganized.

19:10.495 --> 19:15.125
- Disorganized labor. - You can keep
trotting out that phrase all you like,

19:15.135 --> 19:17.805
but you know what I'd like to do, Frank?
I would like to get back

19:17.815 --> 19:20.210
to the issue here
of educating our children

19:20.220 --> 19:22.845
and the fact that congress is not
living up to their commitment.

19:22.855 --> 19:24.245
Well, you know
what I would like?

19:24.255 --> 19:24.755
What?

19:25.980 --> 19:27.080
An apology.

19:27.860 --> 19:30.860
If not to me, then to my wife.

19:30.980 --> 19:33.685
When that brick came through
our window, it was terrifying.

19:33.695 --> 19:36.010
She's standing right over there.

19:36.020 --> 19:37.685
- Claire?
- We need camera two on the wife.

19:37.695 --> 19:40.010
Now, why don't you
look her in the eye

19:40.020 --> 19:44.125
and tell her that your people had
nothing to do with that brick.

19:44.135 --> 19:46.735
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

19:49.060 --> 19:49.560
Okay.

19:53.620 --> 19:55.920
Mrs. Underwood, Claire,

19:56.575 --> 19:58.575
I am sincerely sorry

19:59.460 --> 20:03.285
that you had to go through
that ordeal, truly.

20:03.295 --> 20:05.895
And it actually sickens me

20:06.060 --> 20:09.130
that someone made you
feel unsafe in your own home.

20:09.140 --> 20:12.485
And I give you my word that
to the best of my knowledge,

20:12.495 --> 20:15.725
none of our people
had anything to do with it.

20:15.735 --> 20:18.370
But you know
what sickens me more?

20:18.380 --> 20:20.650
That right now,
your husband is using you

20:20.660 --> 20:23.810
as a prop on national television
to try and win a debate.

20:23.820 --> 20:27.445
So I think you're the one
that owes your wife an apology, Frank.

20:27.455 --> 20:28.730
And when
you're done apologizing,

20:28.740 --> 20:30.645
can we please get back
to the issue here

20:30.655 --> 20:31.850
of educating our children?

20:31.860 --> 20:33.290
No. You've got this wrong,
Marty.

20:33.300 --> 20:36.025
There is no "you" and "I"
in education.

20:36.035 --> 20:38.472
Well, I mean, yes,
there's the letters

20:38.482 --> 20:40.885
"U" and "I" are in
the word "education."

20:40.895 --> 20:44.495
But "Education"
with a capital E...

20:44.740 --> 20:47.845
You know what
I'm talking about.

20:47.855 --> 20:49.755
I don't think I do.

20:50.352 --> 20:52.252
Yes, you do, Marty.

20:53.501 --> 20:55.401
U and I- Education.

20:56.580 --> 20:59.565
So, what, we're gonna waste the rest of
this debate naming all the vowels in-

20:59.575 --> 21:01.050
I'm happy to play
the vowel game.

21:01.060 --> 21:02.445
You wanna play the vowel game
with me?

21:02.455 --> 21:04.755
All right.
U think I O

21:06.735 --> 21:07.935
U A apology.

21:09.692 --> 21:11.192
But no, no, no.

21:12.615 --> 21:13.415
U O I...

21:16.420 --> 21:20.125
Interesting.
You left out E for "Education."

21:20.135 --> 21:21.570
- So let-
- Defecation-

21:21.580 --> 21:24.445
Edification.
I'm sorry. LOL.

21:24.455 --> 21:25.355
Uh, uh...

21:26.372 --> 21:26.872
Uh...

21:28.220 --> 21:30.290
You like sesame street so much?

21:30.300 --> 21:32.205
Why don't you give the kids
the money they deserve?

21:32.215 --> 21:36.410
What I'm trying to say
about education...

21:36.420 --> 21:36.920
Well,

21:37.980 --> 21:39.885
I guess school's
still in session.

21:39.895 --> 21:41.765
I guess you
schooled me there, Marty.

21:41.775 --> 21:43.970
Let's move on.
Please.

21:43.980 --> 21:49.580
Humor aside, there are more
important issues out there.

21:50.940 --> 21:54.610
I had no intention
of bringing you into this.

21:54.620 --> 21:57.285
It wasn't part of a plan.
I would've told you if it was.

21:57.295 --> 21:57.995
I know.

21:58.740 --> 22:03.240
The idea just struck me,
and I went with it.

22:05.340 --> 22:08.145
I don't mind
that you improvised.

22:08.155 --> 22:11.555
I just wish
you'd done it better.

22:28.540 --> 22:31.885
Congressman Frank Underwood
says he got, quote, "schooled"

22:31.895 --> 22:35.205
by AFT spokesman and chief
strategist, Martin Spinella,

22:35.215 --> 22:37.125
during a debate last night
on this network.

22:37.135 --> 22:38.722
In the past 24 hours,

22:38.732 --> 22:40.250
reruns of the gaffe

22:40.260 --> 22:42.725
have played non-stop on TV news
programs and the internet.

22:42.735 --> 22:45.002
A YouTube clip
set to techno music

22:45.012 --> 22:47.181
has logged
more than 300,000 hits

22:47.191 --> 22:49.325
and spawned
dozens of other spoofs.

22:49.335 --> 22:50.335

22:50.392 --> 22:51.392

22:55.592 --> 22:57.330
That was as clumsy

22:57.340 --> 22:59.765
as the Lee Harvey Oswald
prison transfer.

22:59.775 --> 23:01.875
What was he thinking?

23:10.180 --> 23:12.580
Just give me one second.

23:16.620 --> 23:19.920
There's a deli.
Down the street.

23:27.620 --> 23:29.250
Patti, thanks for coming.

23:29.260 --> 23:30.565
Sit down.
You want some coffee?

23:30.575 --> 23:32.370
No, thanks. I'm good.

23:32.380 --> 23:33.925
Hey, did you see
bill Maher last night?

23:33.935 --> 23:35.210
No, I didn't.

23:35.220 --> 23:36.610
Oh, it was about the CNN thing.

23:36.620 --> 23:38.245
I have to admit, Frank,
it was kinda funny.

23:38.255 --> 23:40.370
Well, I'll have
to catch a rerun.

23:40.380 --> 23:42.805
How you doing? You holding up
all right with the strike?

23:42.815 --> 23:44.285
Let's talk about Pennsylvania.

23:44.295 --> 23:46.450
I have your candidate.

23:46.460 --> 23:48.805
Peter Russo.
First Congressional District.

23:48.815 --> 23:50.202
We crossed him off.

23:50.212 --> 23:51.530
I know. It's a mistake.

23:51.540 --> 23:53.450
He's young, he's handsome.
He's bright.

23:53.460 --> 23:55.685
Nobody knows who he
is outside of Philadelphia.

23:55.695 --> 23:57.702
There's no donor base,
no infrastructure.

23:57.712 --> 23:59.651
You start me off
with funding from the DNC

23:59.661 --> 24:02.905
and I'll raise an army
around this guy.

24:02.915 --> 24:06.125
I will personally
oversee his campaign.

24:06.135 --> 24:07.690
Is that the best we can do?

24:07.700 --> 24:12.685
What's better than a blank slate
in the right hands?

24:12.695 --> 24:13.890
Ed, you need to go.

24:13.900 --> 24:15.925
Congressman,
do you have a moment?

24:15.935 --> 24:17.050
Thank you, Patti.

24:17.060 --> 24:19.285
- Have him call me.
- I will.

24:19.295 --> 24:20.395
Ed? Please.

24:20.620 --> 24:22.405
- What is going on?
- I'm taking care of it.

24:22.415 --> 24:23.930
One second, sir.
Please.

24:23.940 --> 24:25.925
All right.
Make it fast, Meechum.

24:25.935 --> 24:27.850
It's not easy for me
to ask this,

24:27.860 --> 24:29.845
but I was wondering
if you could put in a good word

24:29.855 --> 24:31.155
with my boss.

24:31.252 --> 24:32.452
A good word?

24:32.580 --> 24:35.045
They're going to discharge me,
sir.

24:35.055 --> 24:36.570
I messed up.
I'm fully aware.

24:36.580 --> 24:39.385
But my job,
it means everything to me,

24:39.395 --> 24:42.130
and I know a good word
from you would...

24:42.140 --> 24:44.065
Look, I have nothing
against you personally, Meechum,

24:44.075 --> 24:45.965
but I can't get involved
in these sort of affairs.

24:45.975 --> 24:47.210
There's protocols and rules.

24:47.220 --> 24:49.445
Sir, please,
if you spoke to Cardiff-

24:49.455 --> 24:51.130
There is nothing that I can do.

24:51.140 --> 24:52.605
If anyone can convince
the captain,

24:52.615 --> 24:54.690
it would be you, Congressman.

24:54.700 --> 24:57.645
I'm sorry. I wish you
all the best, Meechum.

24:57.655 --> 24:58.155
Doug.

25:02.140 --> 25:03.450
What did Barney hull say?

25:03.460 --> 25:04.865
That we'd be the first to know.

25:04.875 --> 25:06.245
I can't believe
there hasn't been

25:06.255 --> 25:07.422
a single 911 call.

25:07.432 --> 25:08.530
There's been plenty.

25:08.540 --> 25:10.645
It's just not the sort
we're after.

25:10.655 --> 25:12.250
We got that kid in Atlanta.

25:12.260 --> 25:14.485
No, it's got to be here.
I can't be getting on a plane.

25:14.495 --> 25:15.650
It looks too opportunistic.

25:15.660 --> 25:17.125
Maybe if we open it up
a little bit.

25:17.135 --> 25:18.565
No, we cannot
lower our standards.

25:18.575 --> 25:20.890
We just have to be patient.

25:20.900 --> 25:22.650
New rule-
now that the debate's over,

25:22.660 --> 25:25.365
Frank Underwood has to tell us
what the hell that was.

25:25.375 --> 25:27.490
Seriously, Congressman,
was that a joke?

25:27.500 --> 25:29.685
I haven't seen something
just lay there like that

25:29.695 --> 25:30.895
since, uh...

25:31.180 --> 25:35.780
I gotta go all the way back
to my prom night.

25:37.820 --> 25:40.050
Can we just settle
this strike please?

25:40.060 --> 25:42.010
Teachers have been out
of the classroom for so long,

25:42.020 --> 25:46.130
middle schoolers are starting
to have sex with each other.

25:46.140 --> 25:46.840
Enough.

25:47.900 --> 25:53.000
I don't know why you had it on
in the first place.

25:53.260 --> 25:55.260
I love you, Francis.

25:56.975 --> 25:57.675
I know.

25:59.140 --> 26:03.640
We should say that
more often to each other.

26:06.220 --> 26:08.620
I need to clear my head.

26:41.180 --> 26:43.570
...north and east
of the airport.

26:43.580 --> 26:46.165
I'm gonna need that
in time for that meeting.

26:46.175 --> 26:47.975
Peter, let's talk.

26:53.620 --> 26:56.485
So. I've spoken
to Patricia Whittaker.

26:56.495 --> 26:57.970
She's on board.

26:57.980 --> 26:59.685
You'll be getting four million
in start-up funding

26:59.695 --> 27:00.970
from the DNC.

27:00.980 --> 27:03.125
I'll pick the team.
You announce in August.

27:03.135 --> 27:05.445
But the campaign starts today.

27:05.455 --> 27:06.690
Are you ready?

27:06.700 --> 27:08.690
I've already
put together a platform.

27:08.700 --> 27:10.485
It's mostly broad strokes,
but we can hone it.

27:10.495 --> 27:12.525
Good. The first thing
we need to address

27:12.535 --> 27:13.850
is your sobriety.

27:13.860 --> 27:15.405
Oh, you don't need to worry
about that.

27:15.415 --> 27:16.765
Have you been
going to meetings?

27:16.775 --> 27:17.975
You mean AA?

27:18.980 --> 27:21.285
- Yes.
- That's not really my thing.

27:21.295 --> 27:23.295
If you want my help,

27:23.980 --> 27:28.045
then going to meetings
is my one requirement.

27:28.055 --> 27:29.685
I know I had a problem, Frank.

27:29.695 --> 27:30.890
I accept that.

27:30.900 --> 27:32.570
And I've taken
responsibility for that,

27:32.580 --> 27:35.045
but I don't think going
to meetings is necessary.

27:35.055 --> 27:37.485
You cannot white-knuckle
your recovery, Peter.

27:37.495 --> 27:39.125
This campaign will be
the hardest thing

27:39.135 --> 27:40.370
you've ever done in your life.

27:40.380 --> 27:41.970
I realize that.
I'm prepared for that.

27:41.980 --> 27:44.805
You think you are.
But we can't take any chances.

27:44.815 --> 27:47.090
The party's investing in you.

27:47.100 --> 27:52.100
I need to make sure
you're investing in yourself.

27:53.980 --> 27:56.965
All right.
I'll do whatever I have to do.

27:56.975 --> 27:58.762
Good.
You'll start tomorrow morning.

27:58.772 --> 28:00.525
- Doug will take you.
- Stamper?

28:00.535 --> 28:01.902
He's been sober 14 years.

28:01.912 --> 28:03.210
Doug has a drinking problem?

28:03.220 --> 28:06.010
Had. Not anymore.
He'll be your sponsor.

28:06.020 --> 28:07.965
In the meantime, I want you
to meet with my wife, Claire.

28:07.975 --> 28:09.445
She runs the clean water
initiative.

28:09.455 --> 28:10.810
She's expecting you,

28:10.820 --> 28:12.685
so clear your schedule
and head over there now.

28:12.695 --> 28:13.295
Frank.

28:15.860 --> 28:16.860
Thank you.

28:17.700 --> 28:19.700
For believing in me.

28:19.900 --> 28:24.300
You're gonna make
a great candidate, Peter.

28:27.940 --> 28:31.645
The shipyard closing frees up
1,100 acres of federal land.

28:31.655 --> 28:34.942
Our goal is to pass a watershed
act for the Delaware River.

28:34.952 --> 28:38.205
We develop the land in an
environmentally-responsible way,

28:38.215 --> 28:39.762
creating jobs in the process.

28:39.772 --> 28:41.250
How many jobs?
Thousands.

28:41.260 --> 28:44.085
We're aiming
for the $200-million mark.

28:44.095 --> 28:45.370
We got a lot of work to do.

28:45.380 --> 28:47.405
We do, but you can start
with the congressman

28:47.415 --> 28:49.370
whose districts
fall within the watershed.

28:49.380 --> 28:51.265
Do you have a draft of the bill
you can show me?

28:51.275 --> 28:56.450
We haven't sponsored
any environmental legislation.

28:56.460 --> 28:58.485
We'll draft it in consultation
with your staff.

28:58.495 --> 29:00.302
Gillian will be
the point person on our end.

29:00.312 --> 29:01.751
I don't have any
legislation experience.

29:01.761 --> 29:03.165
- I'll help you.
- When do we start?

29:03.175 --> 29:04.375
We just did.

29:04.500 --> 29:06.245
Will you introduce him
to the research team?

29:06.255 --> 29:10.155
- I'll be there in one second.
- Sure.

29:16.020 --> 29:17.365
Mr. President?

29:17.375 --> 29:18.650
I want it over.

29:18.660 --> 29:19.905
As soon as possible.

29:19.915 --> 29:21.090
Gut the bill, Frank.

29:21.100 --> 29:22.485
Do whatever's necessary
to end this.

29:22.495 --> 29:23.810
Mr. President,
if we give in now,

29:23.820 --> 29:25.705
the public won't credit you
with a victory.

29:25.715 --> 29:27.565
Not even a hollow one.
They'll chalk it up

29:27.575 --> 29:28.690
as a colossal defeat.

29:28.700 --> 29:30.170
Well, that's on you, Frank.

29:30.180 --> 29:32.525
You let this situation
devolve to where it is.

29:32.535 --> 29:33.890
I've already been blamed

29:33.900 --> 29:35.765
for the largest teacher's strike
in US history.

29:35.775 --> 29:37.605
I won't be held accountable
for it dragging on

29:37.615 --> 29:39.210
months and months.

29:39.220 --> 29:41.565
Mr. President, we have to end
this strike on your terms.

29:41.575 --> 29:42.770
Not anyone else's.

29:42.780 --> 29:46.780
How? By debating
Marty Spinella on CNN?

29:46.940 --> 29:50.485
Sir, you have placed your faith
in me thus far.

29:50.495 --> 29:52.210
I would ask
that you continue to do so.

29:52.220 --> 29:54.365
Whatever you're doing, Frank,
isn't working,

29:54.375 --> 29:55.570
so I'm stepping in.

29:55.580 --> 29:57.085
Gut the bill.
Like Linda said.

29:57.095 --> 29:57.395
No.

30:00.740 --> 30:04.765
I'm sorry, Mr. President,
but I will not do that.

30:04.775 --> 30:08.765
Are you letting pride
cloud your judgment, Frank?

30:08.775 --> 30:09.930
Respectfully, sir,

30:09.940 --> 30:12.405
you're allowing fear
to cloud yours.

30:12.415 --> 30:14.450
Not an easy thing to say no

30:14.460 --> 30:16.330
to the most powerful man
in the free world.

30:16.340 --> 30:19.325
But sometimes the only way
to gain your superior's respect

30:19.335 --> 30:20.835
is to defy him.

30:25.300 --> 30:27.045
What do we have
on the schedule, Linda?

30:27.055 --> 30:28.522
Your meeting with the...

30:28.532 --> 30:29.930
Thank you, Mr. President.

30:29.940 --> 30:31.445
- Do you have my briefing?
- Right here.

30:31.455 --> 30:34.055
Good.
Let's look it over.

30:35.220 --> 30:37.565
Hi.
How'd it go with Peter?

30:37.575 --> 30:38.875
It went well.

30:39.072 --> 30:40.172
Is he game?

30:40.441 --> 30:41.541
Completely.

30:41.805 --> 30:43.090
Ugh. Thank you.

30:43.100 --> 30:44.805
That's a big weight
off my shoulders.

30:44.815 --> 30:46.302
You sound tired.

30:46.312 --> 30:47.771
Tired. Impatient.

30:47.781 --> 30:49.170
What can I do?

30:49.180 --> 30:51.410
Nothing.
This one's up to fate.

30:51.420 --> 30:54.525
I don't like when
we leave things to fate.

30:54.535 --> 30:55.835
Neither do I.

30:56.260 --> 30:59.645
Does that mean I'm gonna have
the bed to myself tonight?

30:59.655 --> 31:00.555
Probably.

31:01.420 --> 31:03.010
Can't Doug man the fort?

31:03.020 --> 31:05.650
Well, he could,
but I'd just toss and turn.

31:05.660 --> 31:08.125
If I'm not gonna sleep,
I might as well not sleep here.

31:08.135 --> 31:10.202
Well, I'll leave the ringer on.

31:10.212 --> 31:12.245
Call me if you want company.

31:12.255 --> 31:14.155
I will.
Goodnight.

31:15.095 --> 31:16.095
Goodnight.

31:19.420 --> 31:21.445
You should go home.
I can take it from here.

31:21.455 --> 31:24.955
Vigilance.
It's good for the soul.

31:25.212 --> 31:28.812
10-59. Corner of 16th and Q.
10-59.

31:28.935 --> 31:30.135
What's that?

31:30.620 --> 31:32.520
Disorderly conduct.

31:36.700 --> 31:38.925
Do you believe in karma?

31:38.935 --> 31:40.435
Absolutely not.

31:40.992 --> 31:42.092
Well, I do.

31:42.980 --> 31:44.650
At least tonight.

31:44.660 --> 31:46.385
Get Captain Cardiff
on the phone.

31:46.395 --> 31:48.085
Let's do something
about Meechum.

31:48.095 --> 31:48.595
What?

31:49.140 --> 31:50.605
Get him his job back.

31:50.615 --> 31:52.045
He fired his weapon.

31:52.055 --> 31:53.555
He overreacted.

31:53.660 --> 31:56.460
Cardiff.
On the phone. Now.

32:01.460 --> 32:03.450
Nancy, give me Captain Cardiff,
please.

32:03.460 --> 32:07.325
We might as well do one
productive thing while we wait.

32:07.335 --> 32:08.922
It requires very little of me

32:08.932 --> 32:10.450
and will mean the world to him.

32:10.460 --> 32:12.205
It's a very
inexpensive investment.

32:12.215 --> 32:14.062
Hello, sir.
This is Doug Stamper.

32:14.072 --> 32:15.885
I have Francis Underwood
for you.

32:15.895 --> 32:17.195
I got him on.

32:19.620 --> 32:22.220
Captain, I know it's late,

32:22.580 --> 32:27.580
but I'd like to talk to you
about Edward Meechum.

32:32.740 --> 32:35.140
Good morning, gentlemen.

32:40.900 --> 32:41.900
Thank you.

32:45.180 --> 32:47.980
- Are you hungry?
- Mm-hmm.

33:02.780 --> 33:04.370
You have any trouble
getting in?

33:04.380 --> 33:06.525
Nah, they made me put it through
the X-ray machine twice.

33:06.535 --> 33:09.250
So I hope it didn't
overcook it.

33:09.260 --> 33:12.085
Frank, you always pay too much.
This is way too much.

33:12.095 --> 33:13.810
For the inconvenience.

33:13.820 --> 33:17.765
You know, 20 years
you been coming to my joint.

33:17.775 --> 33:19.685
This the first time
I been to yours.

33:19.695 --> 33:21.495
What do you think?

33:21.940 --> 33:22.970
I could get used to it.

33:22.980 --> 33:24.565
Well, you're welcome any time.

33:24.575 --> 33:26.242
Thank you, Freddy.

33:26.252 --> 33:27.652
Always, Frank.

33:27.860 --> 33:30.265
Got a...
446 3rd Street...

33:30.275 --> 33:32.645
That's a drive-by shooting.

33:32.655 --> 33:33.855
Get details.

33:49.180 --> 33:51.565
Sir, I want to thank you
for talking to the captain.

33:51.575 --> 33:52.810
He told me you called,

33:52.820 --> 33:55.725
and I can't tell you
how grateful I am.

33:55.735 --> 33:58.845
I want you to listen
very closely

33:58.855 --> 34:00.530
to what I'm about to say.

34:00.540 --> 34:04.240
From this moment on,
you are a rock.

34:04.675 --> 34:08.375
You absorb nothing,
you say nothing,

34:08.775 --> 34:11.074
and nothing breaks you.

34:11.739 --> 34:14.165
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

34:14.175 --> 34:15.475
Welcome back.

34:52.500 --> 34:53.100
Steve?

34:53.699 --> 34:55.500
I'll leave you be.

34:56.540 --> 34:59.140
Where, uh-
where's Janet?

34:59.820 --> 35:02.925
She's been here every day
for the last few weeks.

35:02.935 --> 35:05.805
I told her go home,
get some rest.

35:05.815 --> 35:07.090
Well, is everything okay?

35:07.100 --> 35:09.685
Your text
said it was important.

35:09.695 --> 35:12.245
I don't know how to put this.

35:12.255 --> 35:14.055
The thing is, I...

35:14.972 --> 35:16.872
I've been thinking.

35:17.655 --> 35:18.255
A lot.

35:21.580 --> 35:22.980
About my life.

35:23.620 --> 35:26.765
About the things I haven't done.

35:26.775 --> 35:28.975
Things I haven't said.

35:30.772 --> 35:32.772
I hate your husband.

35:38.940 --> 35:40.840
A lot of people do.

35:42.100 --> 35:46.300
The past eight years,
I watched over him.

35:49.575 --> 35:52.975
But it wasn't him
I was watching.

35:54.175 --> 35:56.650
And every time I saw you,

35:56.660 --> 35:59.105
every time I heard your voice,

35:59.115 --> 36:02.315
all I could think to myself was,

36:02.562 --> 36:05.562
"Jesus, what I wouldn't give."

36:05.940 --> 36:11.340
I can't tell you how many times
I thought about that.

36:20.060 --> 36:23.365
You know what Francis said to me
when he proposed?

36:23.375 --> 36:25.570
I remember his exact words.

36:25.580 --> 36:30.165
He said, "Claire,
if all you want is happiness,

36:30.175 --> 36:30.875
say no.

36:32.140 --> 36:35.025
I'm not gonna give you
a couple of kids

36:35.035 --> 36:37.692
and count the days
until retirement.

36:37.702 --> 36:41.002
I promise you
freedom from that.

36:42.136 --> 36:45.263
I promise
you'll never be bored."

36:45.273 --> 36:48.330
You know,
he was the only man-

36:48.340 --> 36:52.045
and there were a lot
of others who proposed.

36:52.055 --> 36:55.725
But he was the only one
who understood me.

36:55.735 --> 36:58.370
He didn't put me
on some pedestal.

36:58.380 --> 37:02.645
He knew that I didn't want
to be adored or coddled.

37:02.655 --> 37:07.055
So he took my hand
and he put a ring on it.

37:07.535 --> 37:10.210
Because he knew I'd say yes.

37:10.220 --> 37:15.020
He's a man who knows
how to take what he wants.

37:25.460 --> 37:27.860
Is this what you wanted?

37:27.940 --> 37:30.045
Is that the way you wanted it?

37:30.055 --> 37:31.155
Stop. Stop.

37:32.700 --> 37:34.800
Please. Please. Stop.

37:36.215 --> 37:36.815
Don't.

37:44.180 --> 37:46.480
You told me your truth.

37:46.655 --> 37:48.455
Now you know mine.

38:23.660 --> 38:25.010
Hey, it's Peter.

38:25.020 --> 38:27.050
I don't expect you
to call me back,

38:27.060 --> 38:31.960
but I wanted to let you know
I stopped drinking,

38:32.415 --> 38:35.445
and I went to my first
AA meeting.

38:35.455 --> 38:37.850
Um, I'm supposed to reach out

38:37.860 --> 38:41.460
and make amends
to those I've hurt.

38:42.460 --> 38:46.385
But I guess the real reason
I called you

38:46.395 --> 38:50.285
is just to say I love you
and I miss you.

38:50.295 --> 38:52.195
I hope you're well.

39:01.340 --> 39:03.090
This is work, not play.

39:03.100 --> 39:05.250
Then why'd you bother
coming over?

39:05.260 --> 39:08.165
I was hoping you'd answer
the door naked.

39:08.175 --> 39:09.690
That would be play.

39:09.700 --> 39:11.445
That would be work with a view.

39:11.455 --> 39:12.970
Sorry to disappoint.

39:12.980 --> 39:14.925
How many characters in a tweet?

39:14.935 --> 39:15.335
140.

39:16.100 --> 39:18.965
Type this, let me know
where you land.

39:18.975 --> 39:21.170
"Eight-year-old
Washington DC boy

39:21.180 --> 39:23.965
killed by a stray bullet
in gangland shoot-out."

39:23.975 --> 39:25.875
61 characters left.

39:27.020 --> 39:29.920
"Should have been in school"?

39:33.340 --> 39:34.140
30 left.

39:34.540 --> 39:36.540
"Spinella to blame?"

39:37.655 --> 39:38.055
128.

39:38.860 --> 39:40.160
Press "send."

39:42.060 --> 39:43.610
Now give me a name, details.

39:43.620 --> 39:46.605
Tyler Davis. Third grader
at Vernon Baker Elementary.

39:46.615 --> 39:48.645
Shot outside his home
in southeast

39:48.655 --> 39:50.955
just before noon today.

39:51.812 --> 39:54.512
Sent.
Where are you going?

39:54.900 --> 39:56.570
- To see the mother.
- You don't wanna...?

39:56.580 --> 39:59.645
There's work to do.
I'll see you later tonight.

39:59.655 --> 40:02.205
Tyler never did anything wrong.

40:02.215 --> 40:04.015
He was a good boy.

40:05.972 --> 40:07.972
Everybody loved him.

40:09.695 --> 40:10.695
It's okay.

40:11.380 --> 40:13.410
If Tyler's school
had been in session,

40:13.420 --> 40:15.885
this senseless killing
would have never taken place.

40:15.895 --> 40:17.930
We need to end this strike now

40:17.940 --> 40:19.970
and get all our children
back in school

40:19.980 --> 40:23.725
where they belong before we risk
another death like this.

40:23.735 --> 40:27.410
So, Mr. Spinella, I am headed
to the capitol right now,

40:27.420 --> 40:30.325
and I will remain there until
you are ready to meet and talk

40:30.335 --> 40:33.645
so that we can end
this pointless strike.

40:33.655 --> 40:36.155
Thank you all for coming.

40:36.292 --> 40:38.392
Let's go back inside.

40:38.860 --> 40:41.690
Mr. Spinella, one question...

40:41.700 --> 40:44.005
Mr. Spinella is not to make
a comment at this time.

40:44.015 --> 40:46.315
No comment. No comment.

40:54.740 --> 40:55.740
Thank you.

41:02.060 --> 41:02.660
Frank.

41:13.020 --> 41:13.320
So?

41:16.180 --> 41:18.980
You said you wanted to talk.

41:20.660 --> 41:25.125
You said you wanted
to work out a compromise.

41:25.135 --> 41:25.835
I lied.

41:26.732 --> 41:27.732
Excuse me?

41:28.260 --> 41:33.160
I have no intention
of working out a compromise.

41:33.935 --> 41:38.035
So then why the fuck
are we here, Frank?

41:45.940 --> 41:47.325
What the hell's
the matter with you?

41:47.335 --> 41:48.685
You think this
is some kind of a game?

41:48.695 --> 41:48.995
No.

41:50.020 --> 41:54.520
These are real people
with families to feed.

41:57.260 --> 41:59.725
Would you please stop that?

41:59.735 --> 42:00.735
Stop what?

42:02.260 --> 42:04.885
In five seconds,
I'm out of here.

42:04.895 --> 42:06.495
One. Two. Three.

42:09.540 --> 42:12.140
- Four.
- Goodbye, Frank.

42:12.740 --> 42:15.925
You know the difference
between you and me, Marty?

42:15.935 --> 42:16.435
What?

42:20.340 --> 42:21.585
I'm a white-trash cracker

42:21.595 --> 42:22.770
from a white-trash town

42:22.780 --> 42:24.485
that no one would even bother
to piss on.

42:24.495 --> 42:25.882
But here's the difference-

42:25.892 --> 42:27.210
I've made something of myself.

42:27.220 --> 42:29.325
I have the keys to the capitol.
People respect me.

42:29.335 --> 42:30.890
But you, you're still nothing.

42:30.900 --> 42:33.605
You're just an uppity dago
in an expensive suit

42:33.615 --> 42:35.130
turning tricks for the unions.

42:35.140 --> 42:37.805
Nobody respects
the unions anymore, Marty.

42:37.815 --> 42:40.102
They're dying.
And no one respects you.

42:40.112 --> 42:42.365
The most you'll ever
make of yourself

42:42.375 --> 42:44.582
is blowing men like me.

42:44.592 --> 42:46.592
Men with real power.

42:46.740 --> 42:51.685
Yes. I can smell the cock
on your breath from here.

42:51.695 --> 42:53.445
You think you
can get under my skin?

42:53.455 --> 42:54.755
I know I can.

42:55.780 --> 42:57.680
Kiss my ass, Frank.

42:59.180 --> 43:00.725
You can't afford to walk out.

43:00.735 --> 43:01.635
Watch me.

43:02.180 --> 43:04.645
I've got a dead, underprivileged
kid in my pocket.

43:04.655 --> 43:06.090
What do you have?

43:06.100 --> 43:09.090
I have 2 million
honorable teachers.

43:09.100 --> 43:13.700
Fair enough.
But I got something even better.

43:15.900 --> 43:17.700
Go ahead. Open it.

43:22.180 --> 43:22.680
Okay.

43:23.700 --> 43:25.700
I'll play your game.

43:35.780 --> 43:37.380
You're an idiot.

43:38.935 --> 43:40.635
Stamper threw it.

43:49.500 --> 43:50.770
You're full of shit.

43:50.780 --> 43:52.410
Oh, no, Stamper
threw the brick.

43:52.420 --> 43:55.645
And I made sure Claire
distracted my security.

43:55.655 --> 43:57.555
Are you kidding me?

43:58.100 --> 44:00.445
And to think you wanted me
to apologize to my wife.

44:00.455 --> 44:02.525
You would do something
that low, Frank?

44:02.535 --> 44:03.930
I arranged the brick, Marty,

44:03.940 --> 44:06.245
just like I arranged
this meeting this afternoon.

44:06.255 --> 44:07.490
Back off, Frank.

44:07.500 --> 44:09.505
Why don't you just
get down on your knees

44:09.515 --> 44:11.612
- where you really belong?
- Back off, Frank.

44:11.622 --> 44:13.685
Because the only thing
you're gonna get from me

44:13.695 --> 44:16.795
- is come on your-
- Fuck you!

44:21.660 --> 44:24.160
Everything okay in there?

44:24.935 --> 44:25.335
Ugh.

44:33.500 --> 44:35.970
Look, I'll- I'll tell them
you provoked me.

44:35.980 --> 44:38.405
I'll tell them that you threw
the brick yourself.

44:38.415 --> 44:39.970
And who's going to believe you?

44:39.980 --> 44:42.765
You just assaulted
a United States congressman,

44:42.775 --> 44:44.575
which is a felony.

44:45.780 --> 44:48.285
But I'm not gonna press charges,
Marty.

44:48.295 --> 44:51.095
Because the strike ends now.

45:13.580 --> 45:15.685
You think it'll leave a scar?

45:15.695 --> 45:17.695
I have a thick skin.

45:20.780 --> 45:24.485
The next time you ask me
to invite someone in for coffee,

45:24.495 --> 45:28.245
will you please make sure
no guns go off?

45:28.255 --> 45:29.855
I'll do my best.

45:30.620 --> 45:32.725
I saw Steve again today.

45:32.735 --> 45:33.735
How is he?

45:34.020 --> 45:35.720
In a lot of pain.

45:36.455 --> 45:38.455
Should I go see him?

45:38.820 --> 45:41.420
I don't think you need to.

45:43.580 --> 45:44.680
Zoe Barnes.

45:46.460 --> 45:50.560
When he dies,
we'll pay for his funeral.

45:53.180 --> 45:55.780
You don't need to take it?

45:56.495 --> 45:59.495
No.
I'm done with work today.
