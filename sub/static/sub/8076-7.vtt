00:04.372 --> 00:08.342
[harmonica playing]

00:08.376 --> 00:09.343
PHOTOGRAPHER: Over here.

00:09.377 --> 00:10.244
Over here.

00:10.278 --> 00:13.814
Hey look, I'm the nanny.

00:13.847 --> 00:15.249
PHOTOGRAPHER: Get out of here.

00:18.852 --> 00:21.089
NANCY BARTLETT: OK, the key to
fitting in to New York society

00:21.122 --> 00:23.691
is acting like you
don't want to be here.

00:23.724 --> 00:24.925
Actually, the coolest
thing would be

00:24.958 --> 00:26.527
is if we just left right now.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.096
No, I don't want to leave.

00:28.129 --> 00:30.498
New York parties are
more exciting than I

00:30.531 --> 00:33.901
ever thought they could be.

00:33.934 --> 00:35.403
And this one's for charity.

00:35.436 --> 00:38.038
I don't know which one, but
if Liz Taylor is involved,

00:38.072 --> 00:41.475
you know it has to be
something really sad.

00:41.509 --> 00:44.878
Of course, this is nothing
like New York in its prime.

00:44.912 --> 00:48.249
Let's face it, this city died
years ago when Lou Reed walked

00:48.282 --> 00:50.151
into that methadone clinic.

00:50.184 --> 00:54.021
What do you talk to
these people about?

00:54.054 --> 00:55.989
Hey, we can talk to them
about the Golden Chamber Spa.

00:56.023 --> 00:58.392
Oh, how was it there?

00:58.426 --> 01:00.594
Oh, it was--

01:00.628 --> 01:02.029
ah!

01:02.062 --> 01:05.766
ow!-- fantastic.

01:05.799 --> 01:08.136
Oh God, I just
remembered-- spas are out.

01:08.169 --> 01:10.604
No!

01:10.638 --> 01:12.440
So, I'm dating a prince.

01:12.473 --> 01:13.541
We could talk to
them about that.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.075
But that much
seems like bragging.

01:15.109 --> 01:16.477
Bragging's in.

01:16.510 --> 01:19.079
All right, we're home free.

01:19.113 --> 01:21.048
OK girls, look--

01:21.081 --> 01:22.416
I know you're new at
this, so I'm going

01:22.450 --> 01:24.084
to volunteer to be your guide.

01:24.118 --> 01:26.120
Now look, if we get separated--

01:26.154 --> 01:28.356
Oh, Vendela, honey, I
need to talk to you.

01:28.389 --> 01:29.257
What?

01:29.290 --> 01:30.924
If we get separate, what?

01:30.958 --> 01:31.759
Drinks.

01:35.163 --> 01:43.036
THEME SONG: If what doesn't
kill us is making us stronger,

01:43.070 --> 01:48.008
we're gonna last longer than
that greatest wall in China

01:48.041 --> 01:51.479
or that rabbit with a drum.

01:51.512 --> 01:57.885
If there's one thing that I've
heard while waiting for my turn

01:57.918 --> 02:00.854
it's that in each
life some rain falls,

02:00.888 --> 02:03.824
but you also get some sun.

02:03.857 --> 02:07.795
And we'll make out
better than OK.

02:07.828 --> 02:11.265
Hear what I say?

02:11.299 --> 02:13.667
Hey, any day.

02:26.914 --> 02:27.948
Well, I don't know.

02:27.981 --> 02:30.017
I guess we ought to
mingle a little bit.

02:30.050 --> 02:32.853
Yeah, I think you're right.

02:32.886 --> 02:39.193
So, how things
going at the diner?

02:39.227 --> 02:42.496
Don't mingle with me!

02:42.530 --> 02:44.164
Come on, we'll take a lap.

02:49.503 --> 02:50.371
Who's that?

02:53.341 --> 02:56.176
That is Tina Beige.

02:56.210 --> 02:57.545
Remarkable woman.

02:57.578 --> 03:01.114
Yes, she is the editor
of "Manhattan" magazine.

03:01.148 --> 03:02.683
Oh, I love that magazine.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.418
It's extra heavy for
killing the big bugs.

03:07.388 --> 03:10.658
So I said to him,
darling, you're Gore Vidal.

03:10.691 --> 03:13.126
Of course your story
can be a day late.

03:13.160 --> 03:17.265
Genius does not
punch a time clock.

03:17.298 --> 03:19.066
[cackle]

03:23.904 --> 03:27.475
You've got to work
on your fake laugh.

03:27.508 --> 03:28.742
You want to mingle
more, or you just

03:28.776 --> 03:29.677
want to head for the buffet?

03:29.710 --> 03:32.913
Buffet.

03:32.946 --> 03:35.716
I remember you from
the Vanderbilts'.

03:35.749 --> 03:38.085
You're married to that
delightful arms dealer,

03:38.118 --> 03:39.587
are you not?

03:39.620 --> 03:40.788
Oh, yeah.

03:40.821 --> 03:42.823
As a matter of fact, he's
wrapping up a deal right

03:42.856 --> 03:45.893
now at Roosevelt Junior High.

03:45.926 --> 03:47.661
I'm Estee Langer.

03:47.695 --> 03:49.229
You're Estee Langer?

03:49.263 --> 03:52.466
Oh my god, like in the perfume
and the makeup and all that?

03:52.500 --> 03:53.334
In the flesh.

03:53.367 --> 03:54.502
Oh my god!

03:54.535 --> 03:56.870
Hey, do you know Maybelline?

04:00.708 --> 04:01.842
I'm Jackie Harris.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.344
This is Roseanne Conner.

04:03.377 --> 04:04.978
I'm so glad to meet you.

04:08.816 --> 04:11.585
Man, she must have
a fever or something.

04:11.619 --> 04:15.022
Her hand was hot as hell.

04:15.055 --> 04:15.956
Martini boy!

04:22.229 --> 04:24.164
They're really very good.

04:24.197 --> 04:26.233
I've just had [hiccups]
three of them myself.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.904
Hello, hello, hello.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.906
Look at you.

04:32.940 --> 04:33.807
Look at them.

04:33.841 --> 04:35.943
You look gorgeous.

04:35.976 --> 04:37.478
In fact, you look
like $108 million.

04:40.548 --> 04:41.415
Astrid, remember?

04:41.449 --> 04:42.716
You can call me Bobo.

04:42.750 --> 04:43.851
This is my husband Gardner.

04:43.884 --> 04:44.785
You can call him Dinky.

04:44.818 --> 04:47.855
I call him Peanut.

04:47.888 --> 04:49.923
Were you in town for
the Jackie O. auction?

04:49.957 --> 04:52.326
We couldn't wait to get our
hands on some of her things.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.328
Oh, she had wonderful things.

04:54.362 --> 04:55.329
Colleen Dewhurst died.

04:55.363 --> 04:56.764
I hear she had a lovely things.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.098
Yes.

04:58.131 --> 05:01.502
We've already got red dots
on Barbra Streisand's things,

05:01.535 --> 05:03.871
may she live forever.

05:03.904 --> 05:07.341
Oh, I should have
brought a camera.

05:07.375 --> 05:08.476
Shall I tell you who's here?

05:08.509 --> 05:09.643
Let's see.

05:09.677 --> 05:12.546
Oh, there's Dibs Huntsford
and Didi Rottweiler.

05:12.580 --> 05:14.915
And over here, Baby Dachshund.

05:14.948 --> 05:18.386
And Ulrica Schnauzer.

05:18.419 --> 05:20.888
And the woman I admire
most in the world, Dixie

05:20.921 --> 05:24.124
Hamburgfarkenburgerbender.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.994
She is the perfect
weight for New York--

05:27.027 --> 05:30.564
two pounds above organ failure.

05:30.598 --> 05:31.899
There's two other
people you must meet.

05:31.932 --> 05:33.601
They were at the
auction as well.

05:33.634 --> 05:34.768
You stay here.

05:34.802 --> 05:35.603
Stay money.

05:50.518 --> 05:56.724
[inaudible]
- Fabulous party.

05:56.757 --> 05:57.691
Thank you, darling.

05:57.725 --> 05:58.892
There they are, over there.

05:58.926 --> 06:01.328
$108 million lottery winners.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.096
It'll be coming from their
fingers like ticker tape

06:03.130 --> 06:05.633
by the time I finish with them.

06:05.666 --> 06:07.167
ASTRID: That's them.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.335
PATSY: Liz?

06:08.368 --> 06:10.604
Oh my god, what did Larry
Fortensky do to her?

06:10.638 --> 06:13.373
It's not Liz.

06:13.407 --> 06:15.175
And who's that
drag queen with her?

06:15.208 --> 06:16.544
That's not Liz.

06:16.577 --> 06:17.478
Come meet.

06:17.511 --> 06:18.412
Come meet.

06:18.446 --> 06:20.213
Come meet.

06:20.247 --> 06:23.216
Eddie, Pat, this is
Roseanne and Jackie.

06:23.250 --> 06:24.552
- Hello.
- Hello.

06:24.585 --> 06:25.586
How do you do?

06:25.619 --> 06:27.788
Hey, so you're from
a foreign country?

06:27.821 --> 06:28.856
We're from England.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.658
Oh!

06:30.691 --> 06:31.592
Cool.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.594
Well, sis here is
dating a prince.

06:33.627 --> 06:35.162
Dating a prince.

06:35.195 --> 06:36.830
If it's one of ours,
it must be Edward.

06:40.868 --> 06:42.470
Go get some drinks, darling.
We need oiling up.

06:42.503 --> 06:43.370
Go on.

06:43.403 --> 06:44.872
Yeah.

06:44.905 --> 06:47.908
So, uh, who's the drag queen?

06:50.911 --> 06:55.749
Hey Pat, need any help
with those drinks?

06:55.783 --> 06:58.519
Yes, thanks old man.

06:58.552 --> 07:01.489
Eddie, you have to tell her
what you bought at the auction.

07:01.522 --> 07:02.456
I'll leave.

07:02.490 --> 07:04.124
Oh, not the pink dress.

07:04.157 --> 07:06.627
Not the pink dress.

07:06.660 --> 07:08.061
The pink Bic.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.863
The pink Bic?

07:09.897 --> 07:10.998
The Lady Schick.

07:11.031 --> 07:12.566
What do you want with a razor?

07:12.600 --> 07:15.435
DNA.

07:15.469 --> 07:17.404
Do you understand?

07:17.437 --> 07:19.640
OK, you've got Jackie
Kennedy's DNA on the razor.

07:19.673 --> 07:20.574
No, I don't get it.

07:20.608 --> 07:22.242
Shh!

07:22.275 --> 07:23.544
See this little
spot of blood here.

07:23.577 --> 07:24.545
Don't touch it.

07:24.578 --> 07:26.346
I don't want yours
mingling in there.

07:26.379 --> 07:27.581
You see that?

07:27.615 --> 07:29.783
This spot of blood
contains Jackie O.'s

07:29.817 --> 07:33.487
dynoberululoc nuclear acid.

07:33.521 --> 07:35.823
TOGETHER: Ah, "Jurassic Park!"

07:41.294 --> 07:42.730
It's nice.

07:42.763 --> 07:44.698
What do you think?

07:44.732 --> 07:45.633
Huh.

07:49.703 --> 07:52.072
Delicious.
70 proof.

07:55.408 --> 07:58.912
We're going to clone Jackie
O. Not just one of them.

07:58.946 --> 08:00.347
We can have-- we can
have hundreds of them.

08:00.380 --> 08:02.349
We can have thousands of them.

08:02.382 --> 08:05.252
You know, we could have
little Jackies of all ages.

08:05.285 --> 08:08.789
We can have herds
of Jackie raptors!

08:08.822 --> 08:10.357
Strolling through
the misty valley.

08:10.390 --> 08:12.159
This is going to
be a theme park.

08:12.192 --> 08:13.694
You can go from Bouvier
to Onassis in one

08:13.727 --> 08:14.595
simple tram ride.

08:14.628 --> 08:16.096
This is fantastic.

08:16.129 --> 08:17.397
Oh, I get it.

08:17.430 --> 08:20.333
It's kind of like Dollywood.

08:20.367 --> 08:21.635
Except for, like, Jackiewood!

08:21.669 --> 08:23.236
Yeah.

08:23.270 --> 08:24.738
Six Flags over Jackie!

08:24.772 --> 08:25.839
That's it.

08:25.873 --> 08:27.107
Euro Jackie!

08:27.140 --> 08:28.075
Yeah.

08:28.108 --> 08:29.209
This is only the beginning.

08:29.242 --> 08:31.679
I mean, with your money
we can have a DNA bank.

08:31.712 --> 08:33.581
People can leave their
DNA now so they can

08:33.614 --> 08:36.449
be theme parked when they die.

08:36.483 --> 08:37.551
Are you in?

08:37.585 --> 08:38.952
Well, I don't know.

08:38.986 --> 08:41.154
Do I get to be chairman of the
board or skipper or anything?

08:41.188 --> 08:42.890
- How much have you got?
- $108 million.

08:42.923 --> 08:43.724
Hello, boss.

08:49.730 --> 08:50.898
I got to hand it to you.

08:50.931 --> 08:53.100
The way you walk so
well in those heels,

08:53.133 --> 08:54.501
you about had me convinced.

08:58.405 --> 09:00.507
That's a very covering
foundation you use.

09:03.276 --> 09:04.377
You have a problem
with stubble?

09:04.411 --> 09:06.246
Yeah.
Yeah.

09:06.279 --> 09:07.080
Not on my face.

09:15.188 --> 09:19.326
Roseanna Connelly, I'm going
to do your publicity, darling.

09:19.359 --> 09:21.194
I'm going to do your PR for you.

09:21.228 --> 09:22.696
Sweetheart.

09:22.730 --> 09:25.065
Sweetie!

09:25.098 --> 09:25.999
ROSEANNE: What?

09:26.033 --> 09:27.801
I am going to
do your publicity.

09:27.835 --> 09:31.271
ROSEANNE: What the hell
do I need publicity for?

09:31.304 --> 09:33.440
Everybody needs publicity!

09:33.473 --> 09:34.341
Talk to me.

09:34.374 --> 09:35.242
Come on, talk to me.

09:35.275 --> 09:36.610
Talk to me.

09:36.644 --> 09:39.947
Come on, tell me-- how many
children have you got, darling?

09:39.980 --> 09:41.348
Huh?

09:41.381 --> 09:42.315
How many?

09:42.349 --> 09:43.350
ROSEANNE: Four.

09:43.383 --> 09:44.517
EDINA: Well, you'll
have to lose two.

09:44.551 --> 09:46.620
We'll get Mia Farrow
to adopt them.

09:46.654 --> 09:51.291
PATSY: [laughing] You're not
a man at all, are you Jackie?

09:51.324 --> 09:53.226
I'm not a man!

09:53.260 --> 09:55.195
I'm not a man!

09:55.228 --> 09:57.831
I can't believe you actually
thought I was an actual man.

09:57.865 --> 10:01.534
Because I'm, like, so far
away from being an actual man.

10:01.568 --> 10:02.970
No, I gave birth to a child.

10:03.003 --> 10:05.405
I breastfed a little baby.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.574
These are real.

10:07.607 --> 10:10.878
Milk comes out of these.

10:10.911 --> 10:14.114
But I gotta tell you though,
the ironic thing is that I

10:14.147 --> 10:17.317
thought that you were a man.

10:17.350 --> 10:20.688
Well, I was once,
for about a year.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.555
And then what happened?

10:22.589 --> 10:23.657
Well, it dropped off.

10:27.761 --> 10:30.130
EDINA: I'm going to
change your image for you.

10:30.163 --> 10:32.766
I'm going to change
your image for you.

10:32.800 --> 10:35.035
ROSEANNE: I don't want
my image to be changed.

10:35.068 --> 10:36.169
EDINA: [inaudible]
image changed.

10:36.203 --> 10:38.071
Get this woman another drink.

10:38.105 --> 10:43.777
I'm going to make you the
next heavy belly ellie belly.

10:43.811 --> 10:44.678
Fat is back.

10:44.712 --> 10:45.645
I can see it now.

10:45.679 --> 10:46.847
You can never be
too fat or too rich.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.882
Go [inaudible] Eddie!

10:48.916 --> 10:50.283
EDINA: It won't
cost you very much.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.185
It's just going to
be a small percentage

10:52.219 --> 10:55.555
of your total capital grossage.

10:55.588 --> 10:57.190
Come on, you just throw
money at me, darling.

10:57.224 --> 10:58.792
I'll get you anything.
I'll get you a "People" spread.

10:58.826 --> 11:00.593
I'll get you the Kathie
Regis and Lee show.

11:00.627 --> 11:01.962
JACKIE: No, no, don't!

11:01.995 --> 11:03.596
No, Roseanne, don't
do Kathie Lee.

11:03.630 --> 11:04.765
Not Kathie Lee.

11:04.798 --> 11:06.800
Kathie Lee made
little children work

11:06.834 --> 11:08.268
in sweatshirts in the heat.

11:13.306 --> 11:15.675
Hey, hey, hey!

11:24.151 --> 11:28.555
I'm not going to listen
to one more bad thing

11:28.588 --> 11:31.658
about Kathie Lee Gifford, OK?

11:31.691 --> 11:32.860
What with all the
things she's got

11:32.893 --> 11:36.363
to do between her show,
her Christmas special, all

11:36.396 --> 11:37.898
the things she does
for little Cody,

11:37.931 --> 11:39.699
plus the daughter,
whatever the hell her name

11:39.733 --> 11:43.203
is, do you really think she
has time to be on a cruise ship

11:43.236 --> 11:45.773
as well as overseeing
things in some Honduras

11:45.806 --> 11:47.908
sweat shop in maritime time?

11:47.941 --> 11:50.443
My god, the woman is only human!

11:56.249 --> 11:57.484
You know, when you
think about it,

11:57.517 --> 11:58.986
maybe those children were lucky.

11:59.019 --> 12:02.189
There are millions of
children in our own country

12:02.222 --> 12:03.891
who cannot even find jobs.

12:34.721 --> 12:36.623
UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN:
This must be so hot.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.365
Ear of a rabbit.

12:45.398 --> 12:47.267
A splash of rye.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.536
And the brittle
wings of a dragon fly.

12:52.405 --> 12:53.740
Roseanne.

12:53.773 --> 12:54.975
Roseanne.

12:55.008 --> 12:56.643
Bow unto our midnight den.

12:56.676 --> 12:58.545
The souls of hell
have chosen you.

12:58.578 --> 13:00.747
For a purpose
you will discover.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.450
In another world,
a parallel reality.

13:03.483 --> 13:05.318
Oh, the scent.

13:05.352 --> 13:06.253
The scent.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.988
It is ready.

13:08.021 --> 13:10.123
It is ready.

13:10.157 --> 13:12.993
You shall deliver
what we want.

13:13.026 --> 13:15.395
It belongs to your
daughter, Darlene.

13:15.428 --> 13:17.197
Drink, drink!

13:17.230 --> 13:18.531
ROSEANNE: All right, all right.

13:18.565 --> 13:21.168
But if I'm going to drink it,
I want it from that witch!

13:21.201 --> 13:25.105
["that girl" theme song]

13:25.138 --> 13:28.575
Stop it!

13:28.608 --> 13:29.977
Here, my little pretty.

13:35.983 --> 13:37.951
Mom, is this normal?

13:37.985 --> 13:40.353
I mean, I'm so big and I'm
only eight weeks pregnant.

13:43.991 --> 13:45.525
I don't know how to
tell you this, Darlene,

13:45.558 --> 13:49.062
but this isn't normal
for eight years pregnant.

13:49.096 --> 13:51.231
Good evening, neighbors.

13:51.264 --> 13:52.966
Hello there.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.367
Hello.

13:54.401 --> 13:57.938
We would invite you in, but then
I guess we would be too late.

13:57.971 --> 14:00.908
Oh no, it's OK, Mom, this
is Al and Edna von Meest.

14:00.941 --> 14:02.609
They live next door.

14:02.642 --> 14:06.513
My dear, you are
getting bigger every day.

14:06.546 --> 14:09.549
We know the top
obstetrician in town.

14:09.582 --> 14:11.284
I'll have him sent right over.

14:11.318 --> 14:13.653
Well, we already have
a doctor that we like.

14:13.686 --> 14:17.090
I strongly recommend
you switch to ours.

14:17.124 --> 14:21.061
What are you, one of
those thugs from Blue Cross?

14:21.094 --> 14:23.530
Oh, and look--

14:23.563 --> 14:26.199
we brought you a thermos
of tannis root tea.

14:26.233 --> 14:29.369
Yes, we did. mm, mm, mm.

14:29.402 --> 14:30.370
There we go.

14:30.403 --> 14:31.905
Aren't you forgetting
something, Al?

14:31.939 --> 14:33.273
What, dear?

14:33.306 --> 14:38.478
Oh, he'd lose his head if it
wasn't spiked onto his neck.

14:38.511 --> 14:39.779
The amulet.

14:39.812 --> 14:42.715
Oh, yes, the amulet.

14:42.749 --> 14:44.084
Here it is.

14:44.117 --> 14:47.187
Now, you just wear
this all the time.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.322
It'll keep away the good--

14:49.356 --> 14:52.325
[laughs] I mean evil spirits.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.596
Got to go.

14:56.629 --> 14:59.866
Listen, you just keep
drinking that tea, all right?

14:59.899 --> 15:00.767
All right.

15:00.800 --> 15:01.668
Bye bye!

15:01.701 --> 15:04.304
Drink the tea, dear.

15:04.337 --> 15:05.638
You know, Darlene,
I don't want

15:05.672 --> 15:08.976
to pick your friends for
you, but I hate those people.

15:09.009 --> 15:12.112
Man, I'm hungry.

15:12.145 --> 15:15.048
Ew, ew!

15:15.082 --> 15:17.150
What is that you're
eating, Darlene?

15:17.184 --> 15:18.285
Raw chicken gizzards.

15:18.318 --> 15:21.021
Al and Edna said they'd
be good for the baby.

15:21.054 --> 15:22.789
You're not an animal.

15:22.822 --> 15:26.026
Use a fork!

15:26.059 --> 15:26.926
Wait a minute.

15:26.960 --> 15:27.995
Oh my god.

15:28.028 --> 15:29.829
What did you say their
names were again?

15:29.862 --> 15:31.331
Al and Edna von Meest.

15:31.364 --> 15:34.001
Al and Edna von Meest.

15:34.034 --> 15:37.270
My god, Darlene, their names
spell out "evil demon Satan!"

15:37.304 --> 15:38.538
No way!

15:38.571 --> 15:42.675
Yes, and they also spell
out "Save Damien, not Al!"

15:42.709 --> 15:45.945
And Damian was that horrible
devil kid in "The Omen!"

15:45.979 --> 15:47.880
- Who's Al?
- I don't know.

15:47.914 --> 15:50.117
Listen, we've got to
get you out of here now!

15:50.150 --> 15:51.618
Ah!

15:51.651 --> 15:52.652
Ah!

15:52.685 --> 15:56.589
I'm going to have
the baby right now!

15:56.623 --> 15:59.092
Don't you worry about a thing.

15:59.126 --> 16:00.093
You can trust us.

16:00.127 --> 16:01.094
Ah!

16:01.128 --> 16:06.566
[interposing voices] Mom!

16:06.599 --> 16:09.569
Darlene!

16:09.602 --> 16:12.505
[spooky music playing]

16:57.517 --> 17:00.053
[scream]

17:00.087 --> 17:03.823
You really shouldn't
be here, Roseanne.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.592
This is my first
grandkid, and I'll

17:05.625 --> 17:08.095
be damned if I don't see it.

17:08.128 --> 17:09.096
How ironic.

17:09.129 --> 17:10.463
You'll also be damned if you do.

17:16.035 --> 17:19.806
[gasps] What have
you done to it?

17:19.839 --> 17:22.542
What have you done to its eyes?

17:22.575 --> 17:24.377
They're his father's
eyes, Roseanne.

17:24.411 --> 17:27.147
What are you talking about?

17:27.180 --> 17:29.182
Those are not David's eyes.

17:29.216 --> 17:30.850
David is not his
father, Roseanne.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.985
His father is the
Prince of Darkness.

17:33.019 --> 17:34.787
TOGETHER: Hail.

17:34.821 --> 17:36.489
Hail.

17:36.523 --> 17:38.725
He chose your daughter.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.793
You should be very honored.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.929
There's nothing
wrong with my baby.

17:42.962 --> 17:44.597
He's just my widdle
biddle precious.

17:44.631 --> 17:50.303
[growling] Man, is he going
to be difficult as a teenager.

17:52.939 --> 17:55.975
It's really not fair for the
devil to take my grandchild.

17:56.008 --> 17:57.610
I have never done
anything to the devil.

17:57.644 --> 18:00.813
It's not like I go
to church or nothing.

18:00.847 --> 18:02.815
Roseanne, now that
you know the truth,

18:02.849 --> 18:05.585
I think it would be
better if you left.

18:05.618 --> 18:06.486
That's right.

18:06.519 --> 18:07.554
But don't worry.

18:07.587 --> 18:10.523
You can visit the child
any time you like.

18:10.557 --> 18:14.761
It'll be hot, but
it's a nice, dry heat.

18:14.794 --> 18:15.995
No, not so fast.

18:16.028 --> 18:18.831
I demand to talk to
the baby's father.

18:18.865 --> 18:21.834
Well, unfortunately, Roseanne,
the devil couldn't make it.

18:21.868 --> 18:26.339
But he did send a
lovely fruit basket.

18:26.373 --> 18:29.108
You tell him to get his
ass in here right now,

18:29.142 --> 18:30.243
if he has an ass.

18:30.277 --> 18:33.180
Oh, all right.

18:33.213 --> 18:35.848
He is not going to
be happy about it.

18:42.088 --> 18:43.490
I don't get it.

18:43.523 --> 18:45.024
Are you the devil?

18:45.057 --> 18:46.025
No, Roseanne.

18:46.058 --> 18:48.695
I'm just his advocate.

18:48.728 --> 18:50.497
But you look exactly like me.

18:50.530 --> 18:53.633
I take on whatever
form your subconscious

18:53.666 --> 18:55.535
chooses to give me.

18:55.568 --> 18:57.003
I almost came as a hamburger.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.775
Well, whoever you are,
I'm taking my grandson back.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.645
I think that would
be a mistake, Roseanne.

19:05.678 --> 19:07.480
What do you know
about my grandson?

19:07.514 --> 19:11.083
We know how to get him into
the right network of people.

19:11.117 --> 19:13.786
They only want what's
best for him, Roseanne.

19:13.820 --> 19:18.124
You will be rewarded
beyond your wildest dreams.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.059
You think that some amount
of money is enough for me

19:20.092 --> 19:22.094
to sell you my flesh and blood?

19:22.128 --> 19:23.430
Well, it's not like
you're going to be

19:23.463 --> 19:25.164
able to go back home anymore.

19:25.198 --> 19:28.000
You have become a "have"
in a world of "have nots,"

19:28.034 --> 19:30.537
and that puts your grandson
in a weird position.

19:30.570 --> 19:33.573
Hey, I practically raised
my sister and my husband

19:33.606 --> 19:35.908
and myself and my
three grown kids

19:35.942 --> 19:37.143
plus my daughters' husbands.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.214
I was strong as a
mother, but I am

19:41.248 --> 19:43.149
unstoppable as a grandmother.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.552
You think you're so cool, but
you've given me a lot of power.

19:45.585 --> 19:48.087
I can make you eat too much,
and I can make you steal.

19:48.120 --> 19:50.657
Remember those towels
from Disney World?

19:50.690 --> 19:51.658
What towels?

19:54.694 --> 19:56.496
And I can make you lie.

19:56.529 --> 19:59.098
Well, I'm a damn good
mother, and you know that.

19:59.131 --> 20:01.401
Obviously, the devil
has a problem with women

20:01.434 --> 20:04.103
and a huge problem with mothers.

20:04.136 --> 20:07.440
Well, mothers are
the hardest to turn.

20:07.474 --> 20:10.076
But when we do get one,
we party for centuries.

20:10.109 --> 20:14.881
Well, I love my kid, even
if they do have red beady

20:14.914 --> 20:19.286
eyes and horns and hooves.

20:19.319 --> 20:22.489
I'll love this kid no matter
his race, creed, nationality,

20:22.522 --> 20:24.857
or sexual preference.
- Darn.

20:24.891 --> 20:27.527
I mean damn!

20:27.560 --> 20:29.195
Darlene, get your baby.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.029
We're going home.

20:36.603 --> 20:39.205
You are so beyond
grounded, Darlene!

20:45.345 --> 20:46.546
Wake up.
Roseanne?

20:46.579 --> 20:48.281
Come on, come on.
What's the matter?

20:48.315 --> 20:49.982
She only had those 10
martinis and that little thing

20:50.016 --> 20:50.883
you gave her, Pat.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.452
Oh, pump her stomach.

20:55.488 --> 20:57.590
Hey, that's my sister.

20:57.624 --> 21:00.159
I'll do it.

21:00.192 --> 21:02.061
[punch]

21:02.094 --> 21:03.996
What happened?

21:04.030 --> 21:05.898
You just passed out there.

21:05.932 --> 21:09.536
To be blunt, darling, you're
about three rounds behind us.

21:09.569 --> 21:11.371
Roxanne, there you are.

21:11.404 --> 21:13.773
How can I ever thank
you for your $100,000

21:13.806 --> 21:14.841
donation to our charity?

21:14.874 --> 21:17.610
I didn't give you $100,000!

21:17.644 --> 21:19.712
I'll need some of
that to rehabilitate

21:19.746 --> 21:20.680
her image a percentage.

21:20.713 --> 21:22.415
Of course.

21:22.449 --> 21:24.784
You are very happening
right now, you know that?

21:24.817 --> 21:26.486
You are coming to stay at
my house on the Vineyard

21:26.519 --> 21:27.387
this weekend.

21:27.420 --> 21:28.788
I won't take no.

21:28.821 --> 21:29.989
We can go back to
the party, now.

21:30.022 --> 21:32.792
Everyone's willing to meet her.

21:32.825 --> 21:35.495
Ah, I feel a little woozy.

21:35.528 --> 21:37.397
Ah, drink it off, sweetheart.

21:37.430 --> 21:38.531
Drink it off, sweetie.

21:45.538 --> 21:49.108
[music playing]
