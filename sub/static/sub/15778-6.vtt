00:18.695 --> 00:19.821
You're kidding me!

00:21.631 --> 00:22.620
Take that!

00:22.666 --> 00:26.158
Hank, are you even close to finished?
Dad!

00:26.203 --> 00:29.730
Dean, you smell like a whore.
What's that? Not again!

00:29.773 --> 00:31.172
- Brock!
- What?

00:31.208 --> 00:33.676
- You said to put on your best outfit.
- Outfit, Hank.

00:33.710 --> 00:35.302
- Not costume.
- What the f...?

00:35.345 --> 00:36.505
I guess you can't come.

00:36.546 --> 00:38.673
- Right? Hank can't come?
- Nice try, Dean.

00:38.715 --> 00:41.411
I'm giving you three minutes
to get changed...

00:41.451 --> 00:44.011
or you walk and
I let Dean drive the Charger.

00:44.054 --> 00:47.854
- What did you do, shave with a hatchet?
- I used the razor with the pink handle.

00:47.891 --> 00:51.156
That's my daisy!
I use that one for my head.

00:51.194 --> 00:53.754
- I thought God shaved your head.
- He does!

00:53.797 --> 00:56.095
But he leaves the sides,
Mr. Wisenheimer.

00:56.132 --> 01:00.592
I have been attempting to stave off
this awkward, yet necessary conversation.

01:00.637 --> 01:03.538
- Please, dad.
- This is my duty!

01:04.574 --> 01:07.907
What is funny about my duty?
You know I take my duty quite seriously.

01:07.944 --> 01:09.343
You said...

01:10.380 --> 01:13.008
- Never mind.
- I share your nervousness.

01:13.049 --> 01:16.780
But there are certain facts
that a father must impart to his daughter...

01:16.820 --> 01:19.380
on occasions such as this...
Yes, "doody". Clever.

01:19.422 --> 01:20.912
- Dad...
- Hear me out!

01:22.225 --> 01:24.853
When young women reach oestrus...

01:24.894 --> 01:28.295
the lingam craves...

01:28.331 --> 01:32.358
the stamen-like skills of the yoni.

01:32.402 --> 01:36.361
- This is quite natural.
- Dad, come on. I'm doing you a favor.

01:36.406 --> 01:40.433
Yes, Mr. Venture has been kind enough
to give me some leeway with the rent...

01:40.477 --> 01:43.776
if I get the boys, as he says,
"out of his hair" for the evening.

01:43.813 --> 01:47.772
But as you know, tonight
I teach conjuring at the new school.

01:47.817 --> 01:50.308
It's not a problem.
Kim and I could use a free dinner.

01:50.353 --> 01:53.914
It's just that boys at their age
have unchecked desires coursing...

01:53.957 --> 01:58.223
nay, raging, as a tempest would,
through their tingling nethers!

01:58.261 --> 02:00.422
Come on, dad!

02:00.463 --> 02:04.593
I'm going on a date with...
the Venture Brothers!

02:30.260 --> 02:32.660
Rembrandt van Rijn.

02:32.696 --> 02:35.995
150 years ago,
Delacroix said of Rembrandt...

02:36.032 --> 02:39.433
that his works would be held
higher than those of Raphael.

02:39.469 --> 02:43.269
His blasphemous prophecy
came true within 50 years.

02:43.306 --> 02:47.174
And this one could be yours
for the pittance of 10 million. American.

02:47.210 --> 02:49.770
- No, I want the Mona Lisa.
- Look.

02:49.813 --> 02:52.714
The Mona Lisa's not a better painting,
merely more famous.

02:52.749 --> 02:55.217
And it was made more famous
because it was stolen.

02:55.251 --> 02:59.779
- And this was stolen, so...
- What about her famous smile?

02:59.823 --> 03:01.882
Whatever. She looks like a horse!

03:01.925 --> 03:04.951
It's tiny, you know,
the thing is like, this big.

03:04.994 --> 03:07.554
- Really?
- Yes, really. So this is cheaper.

03:07.597 --> 03:09.861
By the... By the foot.

03:10.767 --> 03:12.826
My queen has arrived.

03:12.869 --> 03:15.667
And bearing wine shandies.

03:15.705 --> 03:18.833
My own variation
on tinto de verano.

03:19.876 --> 03:22.572
Just a little what-not
I picked up in Costa de la Lu...

03:22.612 --> 03:25.012
- What is this crap?
- It's a Rembrandt, how dare you?

03:25.048 --> 03:27.676
I know it's a Rembrandt.
This is arch-villainy to you!

03:27.717 --> 03:30.982
It's a stolen Rembrandt.
That's nefarious.

03:31.020 --> 03:33.181
That's... That's kind of evil. No?

03:33.223 --> 03:36.021
When I met you, you wouldn't
even bother with guys like that.

03:36.059 --> 03:39.290
Not everybody has a trust fund
like your insect ex-boyfriend.

03:39.329 --> 03:43.095
If you think I'll go back to a diet
of Rammen Noodles and Spaghetti-Os...

03:43.133 --> 03:46.534
driving around in a Honda Accord
with a ghost on the hood, sorry.

03:46.569 --> 03:48.161
I have plans.

03:49.205 --> 03:53.574
- What are you doing?
- I'm wringing my hands... menacingly.

03:53.610 --> 03:56.477
Well, nobody can see that!
You're a bookkeeper.

03:56.513 --> 04:00.108
Nothing more than an accountant
in spandex, and you don't even know it!

04:00.150 --> 04:03.745
You want evil!
You want the old stuff?

04:03.787 --> 04:05.345
Fine!

04:08.124 --> 04:09.751
Happy?

04:09.793 --> 04:12.990
- F... great, I think I killed him.
- No, I'm not happy.

04:13.029 --> 04:16.589
- All of this is ludicrous!
- Great! He's bleeding from his wounds.

04:16.632 --> 04:18.999
- Way to over-react!
- I'll need some seltzer.

04:19.035 --> 04:22.402
- What are you thinking?
- This carpet is Persian! Irreplaceable!

04:22.439 --> 04:24.805
What with there not
being a Persia anymore.

04:24.841 --> 04:26.604
Forget it!
I'm gonna go change.

04:26.643 --> 04:29.908
We've those stupid dinner plans
with The Monarch at eight.

04:29.946 --> 04:33.109
That seltzer isn't going to get itself!

04:40.990 --> 04:44.221
24! Ready The Monarch Mobile!

04:44.260 --> 04:45.625
Your leader has a date.

04:45.662 --> 04:48.790
We kind of don't have
a Monarch Mobile anymore.

04:48.832 --> 04:50.299
- Why not?
- We ditched it!

04:50.333 --> 04:53.632
The heat was on us, after that
Venture brother thing, so we thought...

04:53.670 --> 04:57.106
- All right, fine. What are our options?
- We can take my Nissan Stanza.

04:57.140 --> 04:59.938
- Shotgun call, totally!
- What color is it?

04:59.976 --> 05:03.412
Is it diabolical?
Or at least butterfly colored?

05:03.446 --> 05:05.812
- It's powder blue. Mostly.
- Great.

05:05.849 --> 05:08.977
- 21, what do you drive?
- His powder blue Stanza.

05:10.887 --> 05:12.980
I'm finished with work for today.

05:13.022 --> 05:16.549
No, I wanted the boys away
because I made a discovery of the...

05:16.593 --> 05:18.356
Bond scientific kind.

05:18.394 --> 05:21.522
- What did you find? Are you OK?
- I'm more than OK.

05:21.564 --> 05:26.695
While perusing TV guide,
I found a little, shall I say, flick...

05:26.736 --> 05:30.194
starring a one Miss Dolly Parton.

05:30.240 --> 05:32.538
Yeah, it seems she made a racy film...

05:32.575 --> 05:35.305
called <i>The Best</i>
<i>Little Whorehouse in Texas!</i>

05:35.345 --> 05:38.041
Yeah, Doc, you're gonna
be disappointed there...

05:38.081 --> 05:39.639
Don't ruin it for me!

05:39.682 --> 05:42.845
I have popcorn popping
and the VCR set for stun.

05:42.886 --> 05:46.754
- You wanna watch it with me?
- No, I'm cool, I...

05:46.789 --> 05:48.723
I gotta drive the boys to dinner.

05:48.758 --> 05:51.454
I get it!

05:51.494 --> 05:56.158
Yeah, this kind of films are meant
to be watched solo, mono.

05:56.199 --> 05:57.894
Yeah, that's it.

06:01.304 --> 06:02.896
So, are they cute?

06:02.939 --> 06:06.397
Well, Dean, he's kinda cute.
He dresses like Buddy Holly.

06:06.442 --> 06:09.070
- That's cool.
- But I think he does it accidentally.

06:09.112 --> 06:11.672
- What about my date?
- Hank? Yeah. Well...

06:11.714 --> 06:15.741
He's blond, and...
more, like, athletic.

06:15.785 --> 06:18.754
- Sounds good. How does he dress?
- Like Fred from Scooby Doo.

06:19.923 --> 06:22.391
Well, put in my mix tape,
it's right on the dash.

06:22.425 --> 06:26.521
It says, "Chillin' with my peeps,
and my main man The Monarch."

06:26.563 --> 06:28.497
We have to stop
and pick up my... date.

06:28.531 --> 06:30.829
I thought Dr. Girlfriend
was gonna be there!

06:30.867 --> 06:32.767
Yes, with that dick, Phantom Limb!

06:32.802 --> 06:35.999
I plan to use
the never-failed strategy of jealousy!

06:36.039 --> 06:38.530
- Who's your date?
- I met her on the <i>Live Journal.</i>

06:38.575 --> 06:41.772
Which I kept in prison.
I have been blogging.

06:41.811 --> 06:46.805
After posting an especially attractive
picture of my prison-sculpted abs...

06:46.849 --> 06:50.285
she commented
that I was not only "lean"...

06:50.320 --> 06:54.518
I was "to have sex",
whatever that means.

06:56.593 --> 06:59.528
Any advice? You know,
this being our first big date and all?

06:59.562 --> 07:00.620
Yeah.

07:00.663 --> 07:02.426
- No?
- No.

07:02.465 --> 07:07.266
Don't pull out her chair, kiss her hand,
or anything like that, it's kind of dorky.

07:07.303 --> 07:10.636
Just be yourself.
Wait! Here, take this.

07:10.673 --> 07:13.870
It's got plenty of money,
and it doesn't have a cartoon bee on it.

07:13.910 --> 07:18.006
Don't let them pay for anything,
and if you end up going to, like, a movie...

07:18.047 --> 07:19.912
you call me on the two-way, OK?

07:19.949 --> 07:20.973
What about me?

07:21.017 --> 07:24.077
Any advice to help me score
with my mystery date?

07:24.120 --> 07:28.853
Yeah, don't say "score" or anything close
to "mystery date" in front of her.

07:28.891 --> 07:33.294
And don't do that
"Do you like seafood?" joke either.

07:33.329 --> 07:36.298
Can do! Gosh, she would
totally know that joke already.

07:40.269 --> 07:41.736
You're awfully quiet.

07:44.073 --> 07:45.267
What?

07:47.577 --> 07:48.566
Stop that!

07:51.314 --> 07:54.647
And then you go, "My brother
can jump over, like, ten garbage cans!"

07:54.684 --> 07:56.777
And then I'll say something cool, like...

07:56.819 --> 08:00.152
"If I can keep the front wheel
from bursting into flames." OK?

08:00.189 --> 08:02.680
And don't forget to call me
"the Hankanator."

08:02.725 --> 08:04.590
I'll do no such... They're here!

08:04.627 --> 08:07.494
Dude, sit down!
We have to play it cool.

08:07.530 --> 08:10.328
Observe how I scope out
my mystery date...

08:10.366 --> 08:13.665
whilst I pretend
to look at my watch.

08:13.703 --> 08:15.500
Holy moly, look at my date!

08:15.538 --> 08:18.098
She's a Supervillain!
Possibly a Medusa.

08:18.141 --> 08:22.510
Dean, I am not kidding.
She has rope for hair and a shiny costume!

08:22.545 --> 08:25.013
Not fair, she's wearing goggles!

08:25.048 --> 08:28.609
Told you she would dig
my Batman suit, but no!

08:29.519 --> 08:32.352
Go sit somewhere! Watch my back
and pretend you don't know me.

08:32.388 --> 08:36.017
We're dressed like butterflies,
it's gonna be kinda difficult.

08:36.058 --> 08:38.789
Jollyrancher82,
never get henchmen.

08:38.828 --> 08:41.023
You know, that's not my real name.

08:41.063 --> 08:43.794
Well, how was I supposed to know?
I used <i>my</i> real name.

08:43.832 --> 08:47.997
I just thought, you know, "The Monarch,"
I thought you were into cos play.

08:48.037 --> 08:52.770
Real name. And I am into
costume <i>business,</i> not costume play.

08:52.809 --> 08:56.336
Sh...! They're here! Fawn over me!
Treat me as if I am candy!

08:57.346 --> 08:58.745
She's gorgeous!

08:58.781 --> 09:00.749
She is heat incarnate.

09:00.783 --> 09:04.514
When I met her she looked like
that girl Saffron from the band <i>Republica.</i>

09:04.554 --> 09:06.749
She had those red
streaky things in her hair.

09:06.789 --> 09:09.349
- I heard she was kind of manly.
- That's ridiculous!

09:09.392 --> 09:12.190
Who would say such things?
The woman is a delicate flower.

09:12.228 --> 09:15.197
That dude she's with?
That's Phantom Limb.

09:15.231 --> 09:17.893
When he was at college,
he was a scrawny little wuss.

09:17.934 --> 09:20.801
In a desperate attempt
to be cooler than guys like me...

09:20.837 --> 09:25.035
he had his 12-year old roommate create
a machine that speeds up muscle-building.

09:25.074 --> 09:28.805
The machine worked so well
that every molecule in his extremities...

09:28.845 --> 09:31.245
was accelerated
beyond the speed of light!

09:31.280 --> 09:33.111
There were two side effects.

09:33.149 --> 09:37.108
One, he can mess up a guy
just by touching him.

09:37.153 --> 09:40.213
And two, he became a humorless dick!

09:40.256 --> 09:44.317
- How do you think he floats like that?
- He's not floating, his legs are invisible.

09:44.360 --> 09:45.850
- What?
- Yeah.

09:45.895 --> 09:49.626
Used to be a good guy actually.
When he and Billy, that weird midget...

09:49.665 --> 09:52.930
won a bunch of money at <i>Card Sharks,</i>
invented a time machine.

09:52.969 --> 09:55.267
He became a villain, and the story is that...

09:55.304 --> 09:57.864
the time machine was,
like, broken or something.

09:57.907 --> 10:01.104
So Phantom Limbs' arms and legs
and Billy's hand...

10:01.144 --> 10:03.305
were sent 40 years into the future.

10:03.346 --> 10:05.906
- I loved <i>Card Sharks!</i>
- Great show.

10:07.583 --> 10:11.178
- That guy's, like, just a torso.
- Yeah! That's Phantom Limb.

10:11.220 --> 10:15.020
I don't think he professionally hates
my dad, but he totally hates my dad.

10:15.057 --> 10:17.287
I think he used to be
a famous magician.

10:17.326 --> 10:20.693
And one time, while performing
for the Queen of England...

10:20.730 --> 10:23.665
he accidentally made
his arms and legs disappear.

10:23.699 --> 10:26.964
They're now on the moon,
with a whole bunch of rabbits and doves...

10:27.003 --> 10:29.767
and playing cards
and pretty assistants and some milk.

10:29.806 --> 10:31.068
- Never happened.
- Did!

10:31.107 --> 10:33.541
I also heard
that he sliced off a kid's hand.

10:33.576 --> 10:35.942
And ate it! Yeah.
It was that bigheaded guy...

10:35.978 --> 10:37.741
that operated on your balls, Dean.

10:37.780 --> 10:40.408
Hank, don't you have
to go to the bathroom?

10:40.449 --> 10:43.043
What are you, psychic?
I totally do!

10:43.085 --> 10:45.383
Weird! Well ladies...

10:45.421 --> 10:48.652
seems that young Dean here
needs an escort to the bathroom.

10:48.691 --> 10:52.092
If there's any trouble,
you just give Hank here a holler.

10:52.128 --> 10:56.121
Now this one allows the holder
to watch three separate scientists.

10:56.165 --> 11:00.465
Headquarters insurance, with the exception
of bog or volcano hideouts...

11:00.503 --> 11:03.597
full henchmen coverage,
and a nice little mutiny clause.

11:03.639 --> 11:07.268
Whatever! Just give me the one
that lets me take down Venture!

11:07.310 --> 11:09.904
We like to keep
our dreams small, don't we?

11:09.946 --> 11:11.937
Fine, another 38 with henchmen.

11:11.981 --> 11:14.415
Look who's talking!
The Great Phantom Limb!

11:14.450 --> 11:16.611
The most deadly villain of all time, my ass!

11:16.652 --> 11:19.177
You're in granny glasses,
selling me insurance!

11:19.222 --> 11:21.281
- Keep it down, please.
- I'll have you know...

11:21.324 --> 11:24.191
I could take the entire Venture family out
with one phone call!

11:24.227 --> 11:26.821
Sure you could!
That family's indestructible!

11:26.863 --> 11:28.831
- I dare you!
- Fine!

11:29.966 --> 11:33.663
I need an immediate blackout.
Four, and a robot.

11:33.703 --> 11:37.969
Syndicate number,
Victor. Echo. November. Seven-Niner.

11:38.007 --> 11:40.908
Roger, dispatching
Blackout Team now.

11:40.943 --> 11:43.741
- What are you doing?
- I hate that song.

11:43.779 --> 11:46.077
Niner, nice touch.

11:46.115 --> 11:47.912
Within the hour...

11:47.950 --> 11:50.009
the entire Venture family...

11:50.052 --> 11:51.451
will be dead.

12:02.798 --> 12:04.163
Come on! Not again!

12:04.200 --> 12:07.761
I need you in the panic room,
The compound is on full lock-down.

12:07.803 --> 12:11.967
I am this close to seeing Dolly's goods!
I mean, they can't sing forever!

12:12.008 --> 12:15.273
Honestly, this nonsense happens
once a week, I'm not gonna...

12:15.311 --> 12:18.246
- Why are you naked?
- To prey on their fear.

12:18.281 --> 12:20.749
Move like an animal to feel the kill.

12:20.783 --> 12:23.877
Right, now you're scaring me.
What's going on?

12:23.920 --> 12:26.980
I don't know. But judging
from these goggles, it's the Guild.

12:27.023 --> 12:29.787
Seems like you made it
to the big league, what did you do?

12:29.825 --> 12:33.454
Nothing, I was just sitting here
watching the worst porno ever.

12:33.496 --> 12:34.963
Is that a head?

12:34.997 --> 12:36.965
Don't be a nervous nellie.

12:36.999 --> 12:40.298
The generators'll kick in in...
There you go.

12:42.605 --> 12:44.800
This is different, Brock. Isn't it?

12:44.840 --> 12:47.434
We might not win this one.
You get to the panic room!

12:47.476 --> 12:49.967
OK. Just let me finish
peeing on myself.

12:50.012 --> 12:52.913
H.E.L.P. ER, institute tactical
and defensive weaponry.

12:52.949 --> 12:55.315
Escort the doctor to the panic room!

12:58.321 --> 13:00.482
Well, isn't this wonderful?

13:00.523 --> 13:04.391
My favorite part is when <i>you</i> decided
to kill the Venture family.

13:04.427 --> 13:08.193
No, wait! It was
when <i>your</i> fake date ran off crying!

13:08.230 --> 13:11.165
- Come on, Monarch, how old was she?
- Will you look at me?

13:11.200 --> 13:15.000
I'm in a f... butterfly costume. What
age group do you think is attracted to me?

13:15.037 --> 13:18.438
Super. Well, if you gentlemen
will excuse me...

13:18.474 --> 13:22.934
I'm going to powder my nose,
or whatever the <i>cliché</i> is.

13:22.979 --> 13:24.947
Nice one!
Look what you did!

13:24.981 --> 13:26.608
Yeah. I did that.

13:33.289 --> 13:37.419
Strange, you almost can't feel it.

13:37.460 --> 13:39.291
No, don't move.

13:39.328 --> 13:43.822
The knife is still in you, the blade right
between the kidney and the spleen.

13:43.866 --> 13:46.266
- Just a twitch...
- It feels almost cold.

13:46.302 --> 13:49.396
You tell me your target,
and I slide the knife out.

13:49.438 --> 13:50.837
You might live, or...

13:50.873 --> 13:52.966
Blackout. Four and a robot.

13:53.009 --> 13:54.033
Good boy.

13:54.076 --> 13:58.035
I think you may have got the kidney.
I don't wanna die alone.

13:58.080 --> 14:01.379
- Don't go.
- I don't think I hit your kidney.

14:01.417 --> 14:03.783
No, no, you totally did.

14:04.820 --> 14:06.981
Please, hold me.

14:07.023 --> 14:08.957
I'm pretty sure I missed the kidney.

14:08.991 --> 14:11.824
You could bleed to death
in, like, four hours, but...

14:11.861 --> 14:15.160
I see a tunnel. I'm scared.

14:15.197 --> 14:18.462
- Could you stroke my hair?
- Look, you are not gonna...

14:18.501 --> 14:21.993
Can you sing to me?
Could you sing a <i>Technotronic</i> song?

14:22.038 --> 14:25.701
- Maybe <i>Pump up the Jam?</i>
- I don't know...

14:25.741 --> 14:28.471
What about <i>Move This?</i>
Do you know that one?

14:30.146 --> 14:31.135
Baby let me...

14:31.180 --> 14:33.375
All signed.
Guess I'm back in the Guild.

14:33.416 --> 14:37.477
Not that it matters, with you believing
you destroyed the Venture Family.

14:37.520 --> 14:38.885
Do you love her?

14:38.921 --> 14:43.051
Don't do this crap. This is way
too high school for me. It's embarrassing.

14:43.092 --> 14:48.052
I'm not letting her go.
So for your sake, I hope you do.

14:48.097 --> 14:49.826
I hope you don't.

14:49.865 --> 14:52.800
H.E.L.P. ER, I need you to get the boys!

14:52.835 --> 14:56.931
H.E.L.P. ER, the boys are in danger!
What the?

14:56.972 --> 14:59.133
H.E.L.P. ER! Damn it!

15:00.409 --> 15:04.072
Doc! Doc!
Stay in the panic room!

15:04.113 --> 15:07.014
I have to protect the boys, Doc!

15:07.049 --> 15:09.108
Don't move! I'll be back.

15:09.151 --> 15:13.485
Totally ruined!
Special thanks to you, Hankanator!

15:13.522 --> 15:16.889
- She'll never talk to me again!
- You can't hide in here all night.

15:16.926 --> 15:20.054
You have to get back on that horse.
You gotta grab her and go...

15:20.096 --> 15:22.257
..."Triana, I'm gonna kiss you.
- Hank...

15:22.298 --> 15:25.665
"I'm gonna kiss you on the mouth,
and you're gonna love..."

15:25.701 --> 15:26.929
- Hank!
- What?!

15:26.969 --> 15:30.132
- You have a stain.
- What? Come on!

15:30.172 --> 15:31.434
Why does that happened?

15:31.474 --> 15:33.908
I shook it so hard
I almost hit that pink puck.

15:33.943 --> 15:35.410
- Well, did you dab?
- What?

15:35.444 --> 15:37.639
- Dab! Did you dab?
- No.

15:37.680 --> 15:38.874
- I dab.
- I don't.

15:38.914 --> 15:40.814
- You should dab.
- Stop saying dab!

15:42.685 --> 15:46.143
- Brock, please, Brock!
- Doc, I'm going for the boys.

15:46.188 --> 15:48.213
- They're a target.
- Brock? Brock?

15:48.257 --> 15:51.124
- Doc, you OK?
- Emphatically no, Brock.

15:51.160 --> 15:53.958
- Can't see you, what's going on?
- I'm on the V-com.

15:53.996 --> 15:55.486
I made it to the panic room.

15:55.531 --> 15:59.399
H.E.L.P. ER kept them off at first,
but man, those guys were persistent!

15:59.435 --> 16:01.596
Most of my blood is on the floor...

16:01.637 --> 16:05.129
and the only thing keeping me alive
is our lack of storage.

16:05.174 --> 16:08.974
If you don't come save me,
I'm going to fire you, Brock.

16:09.011 --> 16:12.742
You gotta try to hold on, Doc.
I'll be back soon!

16:12.781 --> 16:14.806
Brock, you're fired.

16:16.852 --> 16:18.513
Steak fries.

16:18.554 --> 16:20.181
Always soggy.

16:22.725 --> 16:24.022
F... - this!

16:24.059 --> 16:27.051
Well, maybe you could
put more water on it.

16:27.096 --> 16:30.691
Then it'll look like you accidentally
splashed it washing your hands.

16:30.733 --> 16:33.759
Or like I completely hauled off
and whizzed all over myself.

16:33.802 --> 16:37.397
- I'll get it. Hi, Brock.
- Dean, are you safe? Where are you?

16:37.439 --> 16:41.307
- Yeah, we're fine. We're in the bathroom.
- Date's over, I'm coming to get you.

16:41.343 --> 16:44.938
You heard? I swear,
I didn't kiss her hand or anything.

16:44.980 --> 16:47.244
- But Hank...
- Enter ingenuity, Deano!

16:47.283 --> 16:50.218
You've gotta try this.
It feels too good!

16:50.252 --> 16:53.744
It feels like somebody with a fever
is yelling at my pants!

16:53.789 --> 16:55.120
- This rules!
- OK.

16:55.157 --> 16:58.126
Brock, this place is crawling
with guys who hate dad.

16:58.160 --> 16:59.149
That figures.

16:59.195 --> 17:01.629
- Stay in the bathroom! Don't move!
- Alright!

17:03.098 --> 17:04.531
Where did everybody go?

17:04.567 --> 17:06.660
- When did that happen?
- It beats me.

17:06.702 --> 17:10.934
The Monarch is probably waiting in the car,
he's gonna kill us for dawdling.

17:10.973 --> 17:14.339
- Pay the bill, I gotta use the can.
- I'm not gonna stay here alone.

17:14.376 --> 17:15.569
I look like an idiot!

17:15.611 --> 17:18.546
You just ate dinner with a guy
dressed exactly like you.

17:18.580 --> 17:20.515
At least I look
like a popular idiot.

17:20.549 --> 17:22.380
We need one of these at home!

17:22.417 --> 17:24.909
It's better than sitting
sideways on a swing!

17:24.954 --> 17:28.515
You have got to try this! OK?
You know, like, in the pool?

17:28.557 --> 17:31.048
- What are they doing here?
- How do I know?

17:31.093 --> 17:33.755
- Gotta tell the boss.
- I'm not going out there.

17:33.796 --> 17:36.697
Dude, get outta here,
I gotta take a Count Dooku.

17:36.732 --> 17:40.099
I swear...
My pants are on fire! Dean! Dean!

17:40.135 --> 17:42.763
My pants are on fire! Don't!

17:42.805 --> 17:46.172
Dude, stop wailing on my jug!
Throw water on it!

17:46.208 --> 17:48.267
No way!
That's what started this!

17:48.310 --> 17:50.904
Well, then take it easy.
Just dab, dab it!

17:50.946 --> 17:53.847
Can't believe
it's hard to kill these two.

17:53.882 --> 17:57.318
Don't talk to me, if I push any harder
I'm gonna pop a gasket!

17:57.353 --> 17:58.752
Pretend you're alone.

17:58.787 --> 18:02.416
- Wait. You hear Phantom Limb?
- Blackout target...

18:02.458 --> 18:05.655
Victor, Echo, November, Seven-Niner
is in daddy's lap.

18:05.694 --> 18:07.594
Repeat, in daddy's lap.

18:07.630 --> 18:09.291
Call off Blackout Team.

18:09.331 --> 18:14.132
Daddy is going
to put the boys to bed... himself.

18:15.170 --> 18:18.105
Yes, I'm going to kill them.
It's a very simple metaphor.

18:18.140 --> 18:19.368
Copy, big daddy.

18:19.408 --> 18:22.002
Quick, just play something.

18:22.044 --> 18:24.478
How many <i>Yazz</i> albums
do you have on here?

18:24.513 --> 18:27.971
Control to Blackout Team, stand down.

18:28.017 --> 18:31.475
Daddy is going to put
the boys to bed himself.

18:36.058 --> 18:37.423
Can I ask you a question?

18:37.459 --> 18:40.087
Yes, I belong in here,
I just have a deep voice.

18:40.129 --> 18:42.154
- OK, can I ask you another one?
- Sure.

18:42.197 --> 18:45.564
- What color lipstick is that?
- Pink poodle. It's a matt color.

18:45.601 --> 18:48.434
They give a Guild discount.
You're in the Guild, right?

18:48.470 --> 18:51.098
- I don't know what the Guild means.
- Tell me about it!

18:51.140 --> 18:52.869
I don't know anymore myself.

18:52.908 --> 18:55.638
So, do you work single,
number two a man?

18:55.678 --> 18:58.943
- I don't really have a guy.
- Well, let me give you my card.

18:58.981 --> 19:01.973
I like your look. Now,
I've had it up to here with men...

19:02.017 --> 19:04.076
and I think we
might make a nice team.

19:04.119 --> 19:05.347
Call me.

19:06.722 --> 19:10.158
Did you see that?
That woman just totally hit on me.

19:10.192 --> 19:13.025
She wasn't hitting on you, read the card.

19:13.062 --> 19:18.364
Oh, my God! I knew it!
She's a Supervillain, that is so cool.

19:18.400 --> 19:21.301
She thought I was a bad guy.
I am so gonna do this.

19:26.642 --> 19:28.303
Naked.

19:31.714 --> 19:33.944
- Holy crap!
- Whatever it is, we didn't do it.

19:33.982 --> 19:36.280
I believe you.
Stay here, don't do anything.

19:36.318 --> 19:39.845
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir. Yes, I understand, sir.

19:39.888 --> 19:42.220
Well, on the up side,
I finally dropped one.

19:42.257 --> 19:43.281
Yeah, me too.

19:45.194 --> 19:46.252
Hello, Brock.

19:46.295 --> 19:49.731
I was wondering when you'd show up.
I had nothing to do with this.

19:49.765 --> 19:53.758
Phantom Nimrod was showing off
in front of my girlfriend. I told him...

19:53.802 --> 19:57.499
- Alright, stay out of this one.
- No, duh? He's in the next stall.

19:57.539 --> 20:01.236
- He has that dickweed boss of yours.
- Don't push it.

20:01.276 --> 20:02.573
Nice ass, Samson.

20:03.612 --> 20:06.911
Brock Samson, the Venture mule.

20:06.949 --> 20:09.417
Do you always hang out naked
in the men's bathroom?

20:09.451 --> 20:10.440
Why did you do it?

20:10.486 --> 20:13.011
Why do men like us do anything?
Because we can.

20:13.055 --> 20:17.185
Wrong answer! How would you like
your neck to match your arms?

20:17.226 --> 20:20.024
You take me out
and the Guild of Calamitous Intent...

20:20.062 --> 20:21.586
will rain down on you <i>en masse.</i>

20:21.630 --> 20:24.565
Every woman you've loved,
every mouth you've kissed...

20:24.600 --> 20:27.398
every hand you've shaken
will fall dead to the ground.

20:27.436 --> 20:30.735
I'm aware of that.
So let me give you a warning.

20:30.773 --> 20:34.504
If you ever stick your goons
on the Venture family...

20:34.543 --> 20:36.738
<i>my</i> family, I will...

20:36.779 --> 20:39.304
Yes, of course.
Scary, scary.

20:39.348 --> 20:41.578
It won't happen again.

20:41.617 --> 20:46.645
Funny, what we men are capable of
when we fear our women leaving us.

20:46.688 --> 20:50.749
Being a man,
it's so much easier to kill than to love.

20:51.560 --> 20:52.857
I'm sorry.

20:52.895 --> 20:56.592
Thank you.
We're not so different, you and I.

20:56.632 --> 21:00.762
Yeah, I don't need another "we're not
so different" speech, I get those a lot.

21:00.803 --> 21:02.202
Yes, I'm sure you do.

21:02.237 --> 21:06.037
Then shall we just shake hands
and leave as enemies?

21:21.523 --> 21:22.785
For a minute there...

21:22.825 --> 21:26.283
I thought you were going to do
your... killer hand thing.

21:26.328 --> 21:27.556
So did I.

21:28.931 --> 21:30.421
What happened in there?

21:30.466 --> 21:34.163
- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
- You wanna get dessert?

21:34.203 --> 21:37.764
- I do!
- I'm gonna be a Supervillain!

21:37.806 --> 21:39.831
Yeah, I'm gonna be Batman.

21:39.875 --> 21:41.775
Go Team Venture!

21:42.845 --> 21:43.903
Dude, I warned you.

21:43.946 --> 21:46.312
I think I just found
my first arch-enemies.

22:14.610 --> 22:17.545
Oh yeah, it's a musical.
You never get to see anything!

22:17.579 --> 22:19.012
Here it is new, Dr. Venture.

22:19.047 --> 22:22.141
Don't lift anything for a while
or your arm might fall off.

22:22.184 --> 22:23.947
- Really?
- No, I'm joking, but...

22:23.986 --> 22:26.386
don't lift anything,
cause it could fall off.

22:26.421 --> 22:28.821
- Thanks, Billy. What are you doing?
- Nothing.

22:28.857 --> 22:32.418
The hand gets kinda buggy when I use it
for delicate work, it's fine now.

22:32.461 --> 22:35.487
- How did you get that thing?
- Excellent question, I've no idea.

22:35.531 --> 22:38.466
