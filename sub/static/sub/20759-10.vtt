When a fan buys a jersey,

25:56.513 --> 25:58.515
they keep it for life,

Hang on. Are you trying to get me
to change the name or not?

It's just, Native Americans
are such a tiny minority.

a much bigger group?

would buy the jerseys to burn them

would buy 'em because--

but now we're gonna be banned
from this gas station for life!

30:13.228 --> 30:14.604
Banned.

30:15.564 --> 30:16.398
Banned!

30:16.481 --> 30:19.860
Now get out of here
while I clean up your mess.

30:21.737 --> 30:23.488
Oh, damn it, Titus!

30:23.572 --> 30:25.240
It's like someone flipped over

30:25.324 --> 30:28.410
a Roy Rogers fixings bar in here!

30:28.493 --> 30:29.953
[Paulie gagging]

30:30.037 --> 30:31.371
Well, I'm also seeing someone.

30:31.455 --> 30:32.873
His name is Reuben,

30:32.956 --> 30:35.334
and he's as hot as the sandwich
he's named after.

30:37.878 --> 30:39.087
Yeah.

30:39.171 --> 30:40.964
After the last date, you were like,

30:41.048 --> 30:43.091
"Sproi-oi-oing!"

30:44.134 --> 30:45.218
Titus is doing great.

30:45.302 --> 30:46.720
His scurvy's gone.

30:46.803 --> 30:48.221
He didn't eat Dionne Warwick.

30:48.305 --> 30:50.724
Our neighbor got HBO
and we can hear it through the wall.

30:50.807 --> 30:52.642
-Stop helping.
-[Mikey] Okay.

30:52.726 --> 30:54.227
Cool.

30:54.311 --> 30:56.104
Glad you're doing good.

30:56.188 --> 30:57.647
So I'll see you around.

31:04.154 --> 31:06.073
He might not come back, Kimmy.

31:10.202 --> 31:12.412
I've just been waiting for him,

31:13.372 --> 31:14.623
but he might not come back.

31:15.916 --> 31:18.460
Maybe I should give Sandwich
a real chance.

31:18.543 --> 31:19.711
I mean, Reuben.

31:19.795 --> 31:20.670
[clattering]

31:20.754 --> 31:22.881
What the hell
are you still doing here?

31:22.964 --> 31:24.966
Get a life, why don't ya?

31:25.050 --> 31:26.968
You're right. I will.

31:30.430 --> 31:32.766
[chuckles mockingly] Banned!

31:32.849 --> 31:34.935
<i>Now on the clock,</i>
<i>the Washington Gun-Takers</i>

31:35.018 --> 31:36.812
<i>with the 20th pick of the NFL draft.</i>

31:36.895 --> 31:39.481
<i>Up next, the Seattle Raisins</i>
<i>That You Think Are Chocolate Chips.</i>

31:39.564 --> 31:42.025
Ugh, I hate them. They're liars.

31:43.151 --> 31:44.528
Jackie Lynn,

31:44.611 --> 31:46.071
I haven't been this proud of you

31:46.154 --> 31:48.156
since that misprint in the paper
said that you were

31:48.240 --> 31:50.200
a National Merit Finalist.

31:52.285 --> 31:54.246
<i>Boyogas!</i>

31:54.329 --> 31:55.414
Well, that's new.

31:56.248 --> 31:58.792
I guess they killed another Eli Manning.

31:58.875 --> 32:01.795
-[all laughing]
-[Eli clone] <i>Boyogas?</i>

32:01.878 --> 32:03.296
[laughter continues]

33:18.914 --> 33:20.832
<i>-Good night, everybody!</i>
<i>-Good night!</i>
