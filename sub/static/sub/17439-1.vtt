02:43.068 --> 02:47.572
<i>Sometimes, late at night,</i>

02:47.574 --> 02:51.475
<i>you can still feel
the loneliness...</i>

02:52.644 --> 02:57.181
<i>Like an animal in the dark,</i>

02:57.183 --> 03:00.384
<i>ready to pounce.</i>

03:00.386 --> 03:04.088
<i>It can make a warm memory</i>

03:04.090 --> 03:09.060
<i>seem empty and unfamiliar.</i>

03:09.628 --> 03:15.232
<i>Past things seem insignificant.</i>

03:15.234 --> 03:21.339
<i>And even faith can seem trivial</i>

03:21.341 --> 03:24.609
<i>and worthless.</i>

03:29.381 --> 03:32.350
<i>My dear Leon.</i>

03:32.352 --> 03:35.286
<i>I remember the day you were born.</i>

03:35.288 --> 03:40.057
<i>You were my little angel.</i>

03:41.193 --> 03:44.261
<i>Always so full of joy.</i>

03:45.530 --> 03:50.034
<i>So full of life.</i>

03:56.141 --> 04:01.278
<i>And then, one day...</i>

04:03.182 --> 04:05.316
<i>Everything changed.</i>

04:05.318 --> 04:09.120
Our father who art in heaven,

04:09.122 --> 04:12.223
- ...hallowed be thy name.
<i>- More than anyone, you deserved...</i>

04:12.225 --> 04:16.360
<i>an explanation.</i>

04:17.262 --> 04:23.201
<i>You needed to know why your
father did what he did.</i>

04:24.302 --> 04:28.406
<i>But that is God's secret.</i>

04:29.574 --> 04:35.046
<i>You were too young then,
too angry to accept it.</i>

04:35.048 --> 04:40.185
<i>Too stubborn to see
that the soul lives on</i>

04:40.187 --> 04:43.020
<i>long after death.</i>

04:43.222 --> 04:48.325
<i>You closed yourself away,</i>

04:48.327 --> 04:50.161
<i>and as you grew,</i>

04:50.163 --> 04:53.464
<i>I prayed that your
faith would return.</i>

04:53.466 --> 04:58.436
<i>But you only became more distant.</i>

05:01.273 --> 05:05.209
<i>And sometimes, late at night,</i>

05:05.211 --> 05:08.745
<i>you still feel the loneliness,</i>

05:08.747 --> 05:15.119
<i>and you've learned that pain
doesn't give up that easily.</i>

05:15.654 --> 05:20.657
<i>That despair is an
affliction of the godless.</i>

05:22.595 --> 05:26.430
<i>My dear Leon, you are
in a terrible danger</i>

05:26.432 --> 05:31.635
<i>unless you can recognize
that your soul lives on</i>

05:31.637 --> 05:33.437
<i>long after death.</i>

05:33.439 --> 05:38.208
<i>It is the only thing
that can save you...</i>

05:39.778 --> 05:44.115
<i>And bring us together again.</i>

07:27.752 --> 07:30.254
<i>Hi. This is Bill Phillips
with tribal trade.</i>

07:30.256 --> 07:33.891
<i>I'm not available at the moment.
Please leave a message,</i>

07:33.893 --> 07:39.864
<i>and I'll return your call within 24
hours. Thank you for using voicemail.</i>

07:39.866 --> 07:43.400
Bill, it's Leon. Give me a call.

08:46.431 --> 08:50.701
<i>I wish we could talk
like we used to.</i>

08:54.372 --> 08:59.043
<i>But once you left,
you never came back.</i>

08:59.711 --> 09:05.082
<i>It's been so long since
you even called.</i>

09:09.054 --> 09:12.589
<i>It's so hard being alone.</i>

09:13.458 --> 09:16.026
<i>There are always
strangers at the door,</i>

09:16.028 --> 09:20.364
<i>and they always want something.</i>

10:29.567 --> 10:33.037
<i>This house is a holy place.</i>

10:36.975 --> 10:41.612
<i>And even though you never
visited me here...</i>

10:43.048 --> 10:48.118
<i>I have left behind a
few reminders for you.</i>

10:53.191 --> 10:55.526
<i>I leave everything I have</i>

10:55.528 --> 10:59.797
<i>to the only person in my life.</i>

11:03.135 --> 11:05.836
<i>You.</i>

15:24.796 --> 15:26.963
I spent the entire week
preparing for this,

15:26.965 --> 15:29.232
and I walk in, and
it's all right here.

15:29.234 --> 15:31.301
<i>I don't know what
to tell you, Leon.</i>

15:31.303 --> 15:33.370
<i>I had strict orders to
buy everything you sold.</i>

15:33.372 --> 15:37.040
And you didn't think that
I'd find that interesting?

15:37.042 --> 15:38.475
<i>Uh, had no idea.</i>

15:38.477 --> 15:40.344
You don't think it's a little weird

15:40.346 --> 15:42.713
that somebody is only
interested in items

15:42.715 --> 15:43.947
from my personal collection?

15:43.949 --> 15:45.849
<i>I'm a broker, you know the drill.</i>

15:45.851 --> 15:48.919
<i>Confidentiality is always assured.</i>

15:48.921 --> 15:53.423
<i>Listen to me. I swear, I had
no idea it was your mother</i>

15:53.425 --> 15:56.293
<i>who was buying up all your items.</i>

15:56.295 --> 15:59.329
<i>You gotta believe me, Leon.</i>

15:59.331 --> 16:01.865
<i>Hello?</i>

16:01.867 --> 16:04.401
<i>You there?</i>

16:04.403 --> 16:05.402
Yeah.

16:05.404 --> 16:08.138
<i>I got enough on my mind just
getting the best price,</i>

16:08.140 --> 16:10.841
<i>never mind keeping
tabs on who's buying.</i>

16:10.843 --> 16:12.943
- <i>You know what I'm saying?</i>
- Yeah.

16:12.945 --> 16:16.079
<i>When was the last time
you saw her anyway?</i>

16:16.081 --> 16:19.349
It's been a while.

16:19.351 --> 16:23.120
<i>I'm sorry. I know
it's a tough time.</i>

16:23.122 --> 16:25.188
<i>Listen, if you wanna
put any of that stuff</i>

16:25.190 --> 16:27.023
<i>back on the market,
just let me know, okay?</i>

16:27.025 --> 16:30.293
<i>I can move it for you all
over again, double your take.</i>

16:30.295 --> 16:31.995
Okay. Yeah.

16:31.997 --> 16:33.997
Um... thanks, Bill.

16:33.999 --> 16:35.365
<i>Yeah. Don't mention it.</i>

16:35.367 --> 16:38.135
<i>Call me if you need anything, okay?</i>

16:38.137 --> 16:40.003
Yeah.

16:41.906 --> 16:44.040
Bye.

19:35.646 --> 19:38.615
Come back here.

21:04.268 --> 21:07.303
<i>Believe.</i>

22:33.691 --> 22:34.791
<i>Angry God!</i>

22:34.793 --> 22:37.360
<i>Ours is a fearful God!</i>

22:37.362 --> 22:39.863
<i>We have the signs.</i>

22:40.898 --> 22:43.800
<i>We have the word...</i>

22:43.802 --> 22:45.769
<i>Of his ministers on the earth,</i>

22:45.771 --> 22:51.274
<i>and by our faith, we see
what the unbelievers cannot.</i>

22:55.279 --> 22:57.180
<i>...hosts of angels.</i>

22:57.182 --> 23:01.251
<i>The world is full of atheists,</i>

23:01.253 --> 23:03.920
<i>and sinners of the mind,</i>

23:03.922 --> 23:07.357
<i>but we are people of the faith...</i>

24:42.386 --> 24:43.853
Hi.

24:43.855 --> 24:45.889
Hello. I'm from next door.

24:45.891 --> 24:48.859
I was a good friend of your mother.

24:48.861 --> 24:52.629
- Oh, hi, I'm Leon.
- I know who you are.

24:52.631 --> 24:55.332
She spoke about you often.

24:55.334 --> 24:57.834
We're very saddened
by what happened.

24:57.836 --> 25:01.738
We mourned her long,
and miss her deeply.

25:01.740 --> 25:05.608
- Thanks. I appreciate that.
- May I come in?

25:05.610 --> 25:08.411
Now's not really a
great time, but...

25:08.413 --> 25:12.849
- Perhaps later then?
- Yeah.

25:13.517 --> 25:16.920
We are a close community here.

25:16.922 --> 25:19.522
We've had many special moments

25:19.524 --> 25:22.558
in this old house.

25:22.560 --> 25:25.061
It is truly blessed.

25:25.063 --> 25:28.698
Do you believe in angels, Leon?

25:28.700 --> 25:33.369
Your mother believed in
them deeply, as do we.

25:33.371 --> 25:37.573
Perhaps you will join us
once you're settled in.

25:37.575 --> 25:41.711
Yeah, sure. Thanks for stopping by.

25:41.713 --> 25:43.746
One more thing.

25:43.748 --> 25:47.750
There's an animal that's
come out of the woods.

25:47.752 --> 25:52.789
It's probably sick, so
it might be dangerous.

25:52.791 --> 25:55.558
You should be careful.

25:55.560 --> 25:57.360
Okay, I will.

25:57.362 --> 26:01.431
The woods belong to God,
but every so often,

26:01.433 --> 26:05.535
something bad comes out of them.

26:05.537 --> 26:07.537
Okay, I'll keep that in mind.

26:07.539 --> 26:11.741
Bye, Leon. God bless you.

26:11.743 --> 26:13.843
Yeah.

28:41.725 --> 28:42.758
Anna.

28:42.760 --> 28:43.893
<i>Leon, what's up?</i>

28:43.895 --> 28:46.762
Hey. Uh, not much. How are you?

28:46.764 --> 28:49.765
<i>Well, I'm busy, as usual.</i>

28:49.767 --> 28:52.835
Yeah. Uh...

28:52.837 --> 28:54.871
<i>You called.</i>

28:54.873 --> 28:58.107
Yeah. I, uh...

28:59.510 --> 29:02.979
I... I can't remember why I called.

29:02.981 --> 29:03.846
Um...

29:03.848 --> 29:06.282
<i>Look, I really don't
have time for this.</i>

29:06.284 --> 29:09.785
Okay, no, no, no. It's just, um...

29:10.888 --> 29:13.723
I'm at my mom's place now.

29:13.725 --> 29:15.892
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

29:15.894 --> 29:17.994
Yeah, it's...

29:17.996 --> 29:19.695
I had no idea.

29:19.697 --> 29:21.697
Um...

29:21.699 --> 29:25.968
Something happened that
I can't really explain.

29:25.970 --> 29:28.804
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

29:28.806 --> 29:30.006
Um...

29:30.008 --> 29:34.544
You know, I was just
around and settling in,

29:34.546 --> 29:37.013
and, uh, I left the
room for a second,

29:37.015 --> 29:39.115
I came back, and
there's this statue

29:39.117 --> 29:40.950
on the TV when I
didn't put it there.

29:40.952 --> 29:44.320
In fact, I distinctly remember
seeing it in the basement.

29:44.322 --> 29:47.957
<i>- And you're sure?</i>
- I'm positive.

29:50.327 --> 29:52.695
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

29:52.697 --> 29:54.664
How am I feeling?

29:54.666 --> 29:56.666
Uh...

29:56.668 --> 30:00.002
I wanna know why that
statue's on the TV.

30:00.004 --> 30:03.206
<i>Tunnel reality.</i>

30:03.208 --> 30:04.974
Tu... what?

30:04.976 --> 30:09.078
<i>I'm surmising, but the statue
has connotations for you.</i>

30:09.080 --> 30:11.347
<i>Probably not positive ones.</i>

30:11.349 --> 30:13.216
<i>Is that true?</i>

30:13.218 --> 30:14.784
- Yeah.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

30:14.786 --> 30:18.988
<i>So look, you didn't see the statue,
because you didn't wanna see it.</i>

30:18.990 --> 30:22.725
<i>It's probably because you didn't feel
emotionally ready to see it, and yet,</i>

30:22.727 --> 30:25.094
<i>you clearly have a need
to come to terms with it</i>

30:25.096 --> 30:27.363
<i>since you were the one that
brought it up the stairs,</i>

30:27.365 --> 30:30.967
<i>and put it in plain view so
that you would notice it.</i>

30:30.969 --> 30:35.938
<i>It's the statue your
mother gave you, isn't it?</i>

30:35.940 --> 30:38.674
Yeah, yeah.

30:38.676 --> 30:41.310
<i>Same one she used to punish you?</i>

30:41.312 --> 30:43.646
It wasn't...

30:43.648 --> 30:45.281
It was more of a test.

30:45.283 --> 30:48.075
<i>No, you don't test a nine-year-old
boy by lighting candles</i>

30:48.101 --> 30:51.187
<i>and asking him if
he believes in God.</i>

30:51.789 --> 30:55.091
- Could've said yes.
<i>- Yes, but you said no.</i>

30:55.093 --> 30:58.361
<i>And then, she'd start to
blow out all the candles,</i>

30:58.363 --> 31:01.297
<i>and what would she
say was gonna happen</i>

31:01.299 --> 31:05.635
<i>when all the candles
were blown out?</i>

31:08.038 --> 31:10.072
<i>Leon.</i>

31:10.074 --> 31:11.674
What?

31:11.676 --> 31:14.377
<i>I want to hear you say it.</i>

31:14.379 --> 31:18.281
Said the angel would
turn its back and...

31:18.283 --> 31:20.650
Stop protecting me.

31:20.652 --> 31:24.253
<i>And that's why I never
liked your mother.</i>

31:29.092 --> 31:31.994
Well, you cleared it up for me.

31:31.996 --> 31:35.197
<i>Well, it's far from clear to me.</i>

31:35.199 --> 31:38.434
<i>Okay. I think you need to
give it some more thought,</i>

31:38.436 --> 31:42.204
<i>and allow the feelings
associated with the statue to...</i>

31:42.206 --> 31:44.340
<i>express themselves.</i>

31:44.342 --> 31:47.810
- Yeah, yeah.
- <i>You need to.</i>

31:47.812 --> 31:49.745
<i>So is that all?</i>

31:49.747 --> 31:52.982
You still talk like a doctor.

31:52.984 --> 31:55.451
<i>I am a doctor.</i>

31:56.153 --> 31:58.854
<i>Good night, Leon.</i>

31:58.856 --> 32:01.090
Night, doctor.

33:55.472 --> 34:00.075
<i>There was a time when I
was everything to you.</i>

34:00.077 --> 34:05.347
<i>A time when you loved me
as much as I loved you.</i>

34:06.316 --> 34:11.487
<i>A time when you sought my
comfort whenever you were sad,</i>

34:11.489 --> 34:14.056
<i>or afraid.</i>

34:15.559 --> 34:19.929
<i>But you never liked
the game of candles.</i>

34:22.232 --> 34:25.266
<i>You never could forget it.</i>

34:26.902 --> 34:31.974
<i>And a desperate thought
entered your head.</i>

34:33.176 --> 34:38.848
<i>That's when you started to
hate me, your own mother.</i>

34:38.850 --> 34:43.418
<i>You left me all alone.</i>

34:43.420 --> 34:46.589
<i>The funeral was empty without you.</i>

36:21.719 --> 36:24.153
<i>When communicating with the dead,</i>

36:24.155 --> 36:28.424
<i>it is not necessary to resort
to elaborate techniques</i>

36:28.426 --> 36:32.127
<i>or obscure occult rituals.</i>

36:33.063 --> 36:37.433
<i>Spirits communicate through
the most refined apparatus</i>

36:37.435 --> 36:40.336
<i>known to us...</i>

36:40.338 --> 36:42.304
<i>our senses.</i>

36:42.306 --> 36:45.174
<i>It is merely a matter
of tuning ourselves</i>

36:45.176 --> 36:48.477
<i>to the right frequency</i>

36:48.479 --> 36:51.981
<i>to achieve discourse with the dead.</i>

36:51.983 --> 36:53.349
<i>All that is required</i>

36:53.351 --> 36:56.752
<i>is a quiet place close
to the deceased,</i>

36:56.754 --> 37:00.055
<i>focused concentration,</i>

37:00.057 --> 37:03.659
<i>and a bit of patience.</i>

37:03.661 --> 37:09.398
<i>Find a comfortable place
and a relaxing position.</i>

37:10.066 --> 37:12.501
<i>Close your eyes.</i>

37:12.503 --> 37:17.172
<i>Empty yourself of
all your thoughts.</i>

37:17.174 --> 37:20.409
<i>All of your feelings.</i>

37:20.411 --> 37:24.380
<i>All of your worries.</i>

37:24.382 --> 37:27.316
<i>Empty yourself now.</i>

37:27.318 --> 37:32.388
<i>All that is left is yourself.</i>

37:32.390 --> 37:34.757
<i>The self you know.</i>

37:34.759 --> 37:38.527
<i>The self that is pure and safe.</i>

37:38.529 --> 37:43.265
<i>You are exactly where
you want to be.</i>

37:58.782 --> 38:01.250
<i>You are aware of your self</i>

38:01.252 --> 38:05.487
<i>in a way you have
never been before.</i>

38:14.631 --> 38:18.167
<i>Spread out into it.</i>

38:29.079 --> 38:34.249
<i>Feel the warmth of
your living self.</i>

38:44.627 --> 38:46.662
<i>Feel it.</i>

38:51.835 --> 38:56.205
<i>Someone else is here.</i>

39:00.443 --> 39:01.577
Leon.

39:01.579 --> 39:06.482
<i>You know who it is.</i>

39:12.756 --> 39:15.491
<i>Feel them.</i>

39:22.332 --> 39:25.734
<i>Feel their presence.</i>

39:38.882 --> 39:41.884
<i>Do not rush it.</i>

40:13.383 --> 40:17.686
<i>Think of what you
would like to say.</i>

40:26.830 --> 40:31.900
<i>Think of what you would
like to say to that person,</i>

40:31.902 --> 40:34.837
<i>and say it.</i>

46:24.887 --> 46:29.257
<i>We can see what the
unbelievers don't.</i>

46:32.328 --> 46:33.762
<i>Raise your arms.</i>

46:33.764 --> 46:38.233
<i>Raise your arms, and
ask the holy host</i>

46:38.235 --> 46:43.171
<i>to look upon us as
he has in the past,</i>

46:43.173 --> 46:46.341
<i>and by his gaze,</i>

46:46.343 --> 46:50.111
<i>strengthen our faith.</i>

46:50.113 --> 46:52.214
<i>Ask, children.</i>

46:52.216 --> 46:55.350
<i>Ask, sister. Look upon her.</i>

46:55.352 --> 46:59.254
<i>Ask, brother. Look upon him.</i>

46:59.256 --> 47:04.726
<i>Look upon him. Look
upon her. Look upon us.</i>

47:04.728 --> 47:07.095
<i>Raise your arms, sisters.</i>

47:07.097 --> 47:08.930
<i>Ask the holy host.</i>

47:08.932 --> 47:11.199
<i>Look upon this brother.</i>

47:11.201 --> 47:13.635
<i>This brother of faith.</i>

47:13.637 --> 47:15.837
<i>Look upon us.</i>

47:15.839 --> 47:18.173
<i>Look upon us!</i>

47:22.378 --> 47:26.147
<i>Look upon us. Look upon us.</i>

47:26.149 --> 47:29.784
<i>Look upon us.</i>

47:29.786 --> 47:32.420
<i>Look upon us.</i>

48:02.051 --> 48:04.719
<i>Believe or suffer.</i>

48:04.721 --> 48:07.956
<i>This is the message
we've been handed.</i>

48:07.958 --> 48:09.924
<i>Our God is a loving God,</i>

48:09.926 --> 48:16.031
<i>but he is also a God
of wrath and anger.</i>

48:16.033 --> 48:19.901
<i>A God of punishment.</i>

49:29.405 --> 49:32.374
<i>I remember the day you told me</i>

49:32.376 --> 49:36.444
<i>that you didn't believe anymore.</i>

49:37.981 --> 49:41.850
<i>That people don't have souls.</i>

49:41.852 --> 49:45.787
<i>We come from nothing
and go to nothing.</i>

49:45.789 --> 49:49.224
<i>That's what you said.</i>

49:49.226 --> 49:52.260
<i>How, in one second, you were alive,</i>

49:52.262 --> 49:57.265
<i>and in the next, you were gone.</i>

49:58.334 --> 50:00.402
<i>Just like your father.</i>

50:06.242 --> 50:10.378
<i>And all the time you spoke,
I listened patiently...</i>

50:12.349 --> 50:17.519
<i>And then, it was time to
play the game of candles,</i>

50:17.521 --> 50:21.289
<i>but you got angry and
blew them all out.</i>

50:21.291 --> 50:26.528
<i>That's when you felt the
darkness touch you,</i>

50:26.530 --> 50:31.833
<i>and it felt cold and empty.</i>

50:34.036 --> 50:37.439
<i>I re-lit it just in time.</i>

50:37.441 --> 50:39.307
<i>But you were scared,</i>

50:39.309 --> 50:43.011
<i>and you blamed me
for scratching you.</i>

50:43.013 --> 50:46.948
<i>But I was only trying
to protect you.</i>

50:46.950 --> 50:50.318
<i>Only trying to stop you from making</i>

50:50.320 --> 50:54.255
<i>a terrible mistake.</i>

51:58.487 --> 52:01.055
Leon.

52:01.057 --> 52:03.057
Hello.

52:03.059 --> 52:06.394
Hello! Anybody there?

56:10.506 --> 56:12.173
<i>Hello, Mr. Leigh.</i>

56:12.175 --> 56:13.441
<i>How can I help you tonight?</i>

56:13.443 --> 56:17.278
I just had a disturbance
a few minutes ago.

56:17.280 --> 56:21.716
I think, um, someone may have
been trying to break in my house.

56:21.718 --> 56:23.885
<i>Would you like me to call
the police, Mr. Leigh?</i>

56:23.887 --> 56:26.387
Uh, no, no. It's okay now.

56:26.389 --> 56:27.555
<i>Okay. Very well, then.</i>

56:27.557 --> 56:30.158
<i>You said this happened
a few minutes ago.</i>

56:30.160 --> 56:31.459
Yeah, that's right.

56:31.461 --> 56:33.161
<i>If you like, we can
review your data online</i>

56:33.163 --> 56:35.930
- <i>with one of our surveillance experts.</i>
- Yeah, that'd be fine.

56:35.932 --> 56:39.500
- Please hold.
- Thank you.

56:48.377 --> 56:51.245
<i>And that was "and the
angel said unto them,"</i>

56:51.247 --> 56:53.514
<i>from Philip Fournier's</i>
grey childhood.

56:53.516 --> 56:56.184
<i>You are listening to ascension,</i>

56:56.186 --> 56:57.718
<i>music for your salvation.</i>

56:57.720 --> 56:59.453
<i>Good evening, Mr. Leigh.</i>

56:59.455 --> 57:01.422
<i>I understand you've had an incident</i>

57:01.424 --> 57:04.759
- <i>occur outside your home.</i>
- Yes.

57:04.761 --> 57:07.662
<i>I also understand you
would like to review</i>

57:07.664 --> 57:09.497
- <i>the data online.</i>
- Yes.

57:09.499 --> 57:14.268
<i>Are you currently in front
of a working computer?</i>

57:14.270 --> 57:16.504
Yes.

57:16.506 --> 57:21.943
<i>Please access our site at
Winchester surveillance now.</i>

57:26.548 --> 57:27.982
Okay.

57:27.984 --> 57:30.885
<i>Please click on the account tab.</i>

57:32.554 --> 57:33.387
Okay.

57:33.389 --> 57:36.390
<i>Can you tell me your
password, please?</i>

57:40.963 --> 57:44.365
L-e-o-n.

57:46.668 --> 57:48.636
<i>Thank you.</i>

57:48.638 --> 57:50.838
<i>You have been connected.</i>

57:50.840 --> 57:53.975
<i>You have a single camera
outside your home.</i>

57:53.977 --> 57:56.644
- <i>Is that correct?</i>
- Yes.

57:56.646 --> 57:59.714
<i>I will pull the data
beginning from midnight.</i>

57:59.716 --> 58:01.890
<i>Does that sound reasonable to you?</i>

58:01.916 --> 58:03.484
Yes.

58:03.686 --> 58:08.055
<i>You should be able to see
our data on your screen.</i>

58:11.560 --> 58:14.729
<i>I'm afraid the lighting
is not very good.</i>

58:14.731 --> 58:20.268
<i>I will try to enhance the image.
Just a moment, please.</i>

58:20.937 --> 58:23.471
What is that moving?

58:23.773 --> 58:26.574
<i>It appears to be an animal.</i>

58:26.576 --> 58:28.843
What kind of animal?

58:28.845 --> 58:32.481
<i>I regret to inform you that our
information is incomplete.</i>

58:32.483 --> 58:34.349
<i>Just a mo...</i>

58:35.351 --> 58:36.717
Hello?

58:36.719 --> 58:39.754
Hello.

01:00:10.846 --> 01:00:13.948
Fuck.

01:00:20.789 --> 01:00:22.857
All right.

01:00:25.994 --> 01:00:27.495
<i>How are you, Leon?</i>

01:00:27.497 --> 01:00:30.965
<i>Leon.</i>

01:00:30.967 --> 01:00:32.600
<i>Hello?</i>

01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:36.404
Um... there's something happening.

01:00:36.406 --> 01:00:37.905
<i>Calm down. What's the matter?</i>

01:00:37.907 --> 01:00:39.707
There's... there's
somebody in the house.

01:00:39.709 --> 01:00:42.410
- <i>Who? Who is it?</i>
- I don't know. I just...

01:00:42.412 --> 01:00:45.013
<i>- Have you called the police?</i>
- No, no, no. It's, um...

01:00:45.015 --> 01:00:47.315
It's not that kind of somebody.

01:00:47.317 --> 01:00:49.083
- <i>Okay, Leon?</i>
- Yeah.

01:00:49.085 --> 01:00:51.685
<i>- I want you to do something for me, okay?</i>
- What?

01:00:51.687 --> 01:00:52.987
<i>I can tell you're upset,</i>

01:00:52.989 --> 01:00:55.056
<i>so I want you to trust me, okay?</i>

01:00:55.058 --> 01:00:57.024
Yeah. Yeah.

01:00:57.026 --> 01:00:59.427
<i>I want you to close your eyes.</i>

01:00:59.429 --> 01:01:01.696
- Oh, no...
- <i>Trust me, Leon.</i>

01:01:01.698 --> 01:01:04.098
<i>Can you do that for me?</i>

01:01:05.701 --> 01:01:07.501
- Yeah.
- <i>Okay, good.</i>

01:01:07.503 --> 01:01:11.872
<i>Now listen to me. Leon,
I want you to picture</i>

01:01:11.874 --> 01:01:14.709
<i>a pool of water inside of you.
Can you do that for me?</i>

01:01:14.711 --> 01:01:16.577
Yeah.

01:01:16.579 --> 01:01:18.746
<i>The water is warm and calm,</i>

01:01:18.748 --> 01:01:22.550
<i>and every second,
it is rising in you.</i>

01:01:22.552 --> 01:01:24.051
<i>Feel it rising in your body,</i>

01:01:24.053 --> 01:01:26.587
<i>through your chest.
Can you feel it?</i>

01:01:26.589 --> 01:01:28.489
Yeah.

01:01:28.491 --> 01:01:32.026
<i>Okay. Can you feel it
spreading out from you,</i>

01:01:32.028 --> 01:01:36.597
<i>warming and calming
everything around you?</i>

01:01:36.599 --> 01:01:38.466
<i>Can you feel it, Leon?</i>

01:01:38.468 --> 01:01:39.633
Yeah.

01:01:39.635 --> 01:01:42.203
<i>Flowing through you, calming you,</i>

01:01:42.205 --> 01:01:44.705
<i>washing away everything around you,</i>

01:01:44.707 --> 01:01:48.976
<i>until the only thing that
is left is the calm.</i>

01:01:48.978 --> 01:01:50.578
<i>Now open your eyes.</i>

01:01:56.519 --> 01:02:00.020
<i>Leon, are you there?</i>

01:02:00.022 --> 01:02:02.990
<i>- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.</i>

01:02:02.992 --> 01:02:05.059
<i>Good. Now listen, it's late,</i>

01:02:05.061 --> 01:02:08.629
<i>and I really need to get some rest.</i>

01:02:08.631 --> 01:02:09.797
Okay.

01:02:09.799 --> 01:02:12.032
<i>So no more calls, okay?</i>

01:02:12.034 --> 01:02:13.701
No.

01:02:13.703 --> 01:02:15.769
<i>Good night, Leon.</i>

01:02:15.771 --> 01:02:19.039
Yeah, good night. Thank you.

01:06:37.265 --> 01:06:39.767
<i>Leon.</i>

01:07:19.107 --> 01:07:21.575
<i>Believe.</i>

01:07:21.577 --> 01:07:24.178
No.

01:07:30.485 --> 01:07:33.987
- <i>Believe.</i>
- No!

01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:44.064
<i>Believe.</i>

01:07:45.233 --> 01:07:47.234
No.

01:07:48.403 --> 01:07:51.205
I don't believe it.

01:09:18.426 --> 01:09:21.261
<i>Tribal trade. Bill Phillips here.</i>

01:09:21.263 --> 01:09:23.330
Bill, it's Leon.

01:09:23.332 --> 01:09:26.567
<i>Leon? What time is it?</i>

01:09:26.569 --> 01:09:28.969
I wanna sell everything.

01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:30.404
I want it all gone.

01:09:30.406 --> 01:09:34.140
I'll send you a full inventory
in a couple of days.

01:09:34.143 --> 01:09:37.444
<i>Um... yeah. Sure.</i>

01:09:37.446 --> 01:09:41.648
Okay? Thanks. Sorry
for waking you up.

01:10:34.469 --> 01:10:37.304
<i>Don't go.</i>

01:10:41.309 --> 01:10:45.545
<i>There's so much I
want to say to you.</i>

01:10:45.547 --> 01:10:50.651
<i>So much I need to explain.</i>

01:10:51.619 --> 01:10:55.722
<i>I waited so long for
you to come back.</i>

01:10:55.724 --> 01:11:00.794
<i>I waited so long.</i>

01:11:02.697 --> 01:11:08.235
<i>Until I realized you never would.</i>

01:11:08.569 --> 01:11:15.142
<i>That night, I saw something
through the window,</i>

01:11:15.144 --> 01:11:19.046
<i>and I told myself</i>

01:11:19.048 --> 01:11:21.748
<i>it was just a cat.</i>

01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:26.586
<i>I tried to occupy myself,</i>

01:11:26.588 --> 01:11:29.356
<i>but I was afraid.</i>

01:11:29.358 --> 01:11:34.528
<i>I could feel it watching me.</i>

01:11:34.530 --> 01:11:38.498
<i>I wanted to talk to you to tell you</i>

01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:40.767
<i>that I'd made a mistake,</i>

01:11:40.769 --> 01:11:43.303
<i>that you were more important to me</i>

01:11:43.305 --> 01:11:47.274
<i>than anything else in the world.</i>

01:11:47.276 --> 01:11:51.712
<i>But my thoughts were confused,</i>

01:11:51.714 --> 01:11:54.614
<i>and I kept thinking</i>

01:11:54.616 --> 01:12:00.387
<i>it was too big to be a cat.</i>

01:12:05.793 --> 01:12:10.230
<i>That's when I realized what
I'd been trying to ignore</i>

01:12:10.232 --> 01:12:13.366
<i>for so long.</i>

01:12:13.368 --> 01:12:18.438
<i>That you had turned
your back on me.</i>

01:12:20.141 --> 01:12:23.510
<i>That you abandoned me.</i>

01:12:24.512 --> 01:12:28.148
<i>That you no longer cared.</i>

01:12:29.484 --> 01:12:37.290
<i>That my little angel would
no longer protect me.</i>

01:12:38.627 --> 01:12:42.162
<i>And when faith is gone...</i>

01:12:43.631 --> 01:12:49.603
<i>Loneliness can be a monster.</i>

01:13:20.535 --> 01:13:24.437
<i>I thought you would
come to me then.</i>

01:13:25.807 --> 01:13:28.742
<i>But you never did.</i>

01:13:34.415 --> 01:13:42.689
<i>The funeral was empty without you.</i>

01:13:49.664 --> 01:13:54.734
<i>The loneliness is worse
now than it ever was.</i>

01:13:57.939 --> 01:14:03.643
<i>And all I can do is remember</i>

01:14:03.645 --> 01:14:06.546
<i>the way you were,</i>

01:14:06.548 --> 01:14:10.650
<i>and make believe.</i>

01:14:10.652 --> 01:14:16.456
<i>Make believe that you
came looking for me.</i>

01:14:16.458 --> 01:14:21.494
<i>Make believe that you felt.</i>

01:14:22.363 --> 01:14:26.533
<i>Make believe that you hoped.</i>

01:14:26.535 --> 01:14:32.639
<i>Make believe that you remembered.</i>

01:14:32.641 --> 01:14:37.410
<i>Remembered that the soul lives on</i>

01:14:37.412 --> 01:14:39.246
<i>long after death,</i>

01:14:39.248 --> 01:14:45.518
<i>eternally, and without end.</i>

01:14:48.556 --> 01:14:52.392
<i>Make believe that you cared.</i>

01:14:55.830 --> 01:14:59.799
<i>Make believe that you miss me...</i>

01:15:01.602 --> 01:15:06.306
<i>As much as I miss you.</i>
