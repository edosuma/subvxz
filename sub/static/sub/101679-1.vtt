It's okay.
It's okay.

02:30.627 --> 02:33.196
It's okay.
It's alright.

It's okay.

02:37.534 --> 02:38.535
It's okay.

02:38.568 --> 02:40.603
That's good. Okay.

02:40.637 --> 02:42.071
Come on, now.

06:58.828 --> 07:00.763
Mama?

07:13.443 --> 07:15.878
Your brother got here
a couple of hours ago.

07:18.481 --> 07:22.418
I told y'all not to come.

07:22.452 --> 07:25.388
And I told you we were gonna.

07:32.228 --> 07:34.664
You don't need to be here.

07:36.699 --> 07:39.268
I know, Mama.

07:54.484 --> 07:55.652
God damn it.

07:55.685 --> 07:57.553
You boys need some help?

07:57.587 --> 07:59.622
Oh, look who's here, Charlie.

07:59.656 --> 08:01.758
It's Superwoman, saving the day.

08:07.563 --> 08:09.298
Hey, pretty.

08:09.332 --> 08:10.667
You taking care of my mama?

08:10.700 --> 08:12.535
Yeah, I'm trying.

08:13.736 --> 08:15.605
I'm glad y'all came out, though.

08:15.638 --> 08:16.973
It's good.

08:17.006 --> 08:19.275
Tried to get here sooner.

08:19.308 --> 08:21.744
Mom looks tired.

08:21.778 --> 08:25.281
Mom looks like shit.

08:29.752 --> 08:31.854
Okay.
Give it here, Charlie.

09:28.711 --> 09:30.980
Food was good tonight.

09:38.721 --> 09:41.891
Mama, I thought y'all weren't
gonna have anymore babies.

09:41.924 --> 09:43.960
Charlie said there's
more than two kid now.

09:43.993 --> 09:47.864
I thought y'all were
just gonna keep the last few.

09:47.897 --> 09:49.866
Doesn't matter.

09:52.635 --> 09:54.036
Your daddy said to keep working.

09:54.070 --> 09:57.039
That's what we do day after day.

09:58.641 --> 10:00.710
It's gonna be okay, Mama.

10:03.045 --> 10:05.348
What's gonna be okay?

10:08.451 --> 10:09.952
I'mma do the dishes.

10:09.986 --> 10:12.455
That was stupid.

10:12.488 --> 10:14.524
Stupid.

10:14.557 --> 10:15.858
Did the doctor say something?

10:15.892 --> 10:18.060
You both know it!

10:21.097 --> 10:23.399
Never listen to me.

10:23.432 --> 10:24.767
Mama...

10:24.801 --> 10:26.335
Go home! Just...

10:46.489 --> 10:48.758
What was that in there?

10:51.427 --> 10:52.762
We deal with things our own way.

10:52.795 --> 10:55.031
- Is that what she was doing?
- I don't know.

10:55.064 --> 10:56.833
What do you want me
to say, Louise?

10:56.866 --> 11:00.369
She'll talk,
if she wants to talk.

11:02.738 --> 11:04.941
Girls are good.

11:08.077 --> 11:10.046
Sorry I didn't call for their...

11:10.079 --> 11:11.848
You're fine.

11:14.684 --> 11:17.787
Becky didn't want them
to miss school.

11:17.820 --> 11:20.723
I think she's worried about
what it might do to 'em,

11:20.756 --> 11:23.426
seeing him this way.

11:23.459 --> 11:26.662
No one likes
seeing him this way.

11:26.696 --> 11:29.432
So, when was the last time
you talked to him?

11:29.465 --> 11:31.133
They called
for my birthday.

11:31.167 --> 11:33.135
So...

11:33.169 --> 11:35.838
May, I guess.

11:35.872 --> 11:39.108
Last time I saw him,
he was barely there.

11:39.141 --> 11:40.810
How long
you gonna be here?

11:40.843 --> 11:44.046
About a week, I guess.

11:44.080 --> 11:46.482
Friday, maybe.

11:46.515 --> 11:49.619
You still at the post office?

11:51.888 --> 11:55.391
Not... anymore.

11:58.661 --> 12:00.930
We can't leave her
alone out here.

12:03.532 --> 12:07.470
We should've done something.

12:07.503 --> 12:08.905
Hugged her? Something.

12:08.938 --> 12:11.841
Yeah. Yeah.

12:11.874 --> 12:15.478
'Cause that would've made
everything better, probably.

12:23.220 --> 12:24.921
I'm gonna take a shower.

14:12.195 --> 14:14.930
What is it?

14:14.964 --> 14:17.933
It's just the wind.

15:22.299 --> 15:24.367
No, ma'am.

Alright, then.

Mama! Mama!

18:57.180 --> 18:59.382
Hey!

19:17.200 --> 19:18.901
Don't let her fall.

19:18.934 --> 19:20.102
Don't let her fall.

19:20.135 --> 19:21.136
Don't let her fall.

19:21.170 --> 19:22.339
I got you.

19:22.372 --> 19:24.073
I got you.

20:37.112 --> 20:38.314
No, no.

20:38.348 --> 20:40.350
You sit. You're...
You're alright.

20:51.361 --> 20:53.128
I'm so sorry.

20:55.665 --> 20:58.234
I made y'all some food.

20:58.268 --> 21:01.604
It's a roast.

21:01.638 --> 21:04.374
Thank you.

21:14.584 --> 21:18.188
I didn't want
to say anything before.

21:18.221 --> 21:20.323
It... It wasn't my place.

21:23.158 --> 21:25.195
Your mama...

21:25.228 --> 21:28.298
She was saying things.

21:28.331 --> 21:30.966
Talkin' when she thought
I wasn't listenin'.

21:33.403 --> 21:36.639
I didn't like it.

21:36.673 --> 21:39.576
What did she say?

21:39.609 --> 21:43.011
She would sit...

21:43.045 --> 21:45.482
right beside him
just whispering.

21:48.083 --> 21:50.420
But she wasn't talking to him.

21:52.489 --> 21:53.656
Not like she used to.

21:53.690 --> 21:55.558
It was like...

21:55.592 --> 21:59.529
there was someone else.

21:59.562 --> 22:02.565
Someone here.

22:02.599 --> 22:05.768
I thought it'd be better
with her family close by.

22:05.802 --> 22:09.137
I prayed for them.

22:14.477 --> 22:18.581
She was taking care
of him herself at night.

22:18.615 --> 22:22.485
I can set something up now,
if you want.

22:22.519 --> 22:26.289
It might be better for y'all,
if... if someone was here.

22:26.322 --> 22:28.191
Is there anything we can do.

22:28.224 --> 22:31.194
If we took him to the hospital,
would that change anything?

22:31.227 --> 22:33.596
I'll stay in here overnight.

22:33.630 --> 22:35.231
I can do it.

22:35.265 --> 22:37.267
- If you show me.
- I just think you c...

22:37.300 --> 22:39.702
This is what they wanted.

24:07.523 --> 24:09.459
Go on that other side.

24:11.828 --> 24:13.696
Put 'em in this corner, Charlie.

24:39.822 --> 24:42.392
Wait.

25:00.243 --> 25:03.546
Started bringing
different ones up here.

25:03.579 --> 25:07.350
Had a few certain favorites.

25:07.383 --> 25:09.652
I forgot about Vida.

25:21.397 --> 25:24.634
Who was she talking to?

25:24.667 --> 25:26.502
Don't do that.

25:26.536 --> 25:27.770
It doesn't matter.

25:27.804 --> 25:30.873
She didn't know
what she was doing.

25:30.907 --> 25:32.742
Why would you say that?

25:32.775 --> 25:35.712
She chopped up her own
fuckin' fingers in the kitchen.

25:35.745 --> 25:36.913
She made herself die.

25:36.946 --> 25:38.514
Jesus Christ!

25:38.548 --> 25:40.416
Well, it ain't gonna make sense.

25:40.450 --> 25:42.218
Ever.

25:43.820 --> 25:45.354
We should've talked to her!

25:45.388 --> 25:47.290
Yeah, we didn't!

26:06.809 --> 26:08.344
Hey...

26:08.377 --> 26:10.413
That's okay.

26:55.124 --> 26:57.360
I need three fuckin' minutes.

27:03.566 --> 27:07.036
Michael!

27:14.110 --> 27:16.979
- Dad's in here!
- Louise?!

27:36.899 --> 27:39.635
He <i>wa</i> in there.

27:39.669 --> 27:42.605
Fuck.

27:42.638 --> 27:43.806
Fuck!

27:45.908 --> 27:47.443
Do you want
to talk about it?

27:47.476 --> 27:50.012
No.

27:50.046 --> 27:52.448
I'm gonna go have a cigarette.

27:52.481 --> 27:55.718
I'll come out there with you.

27:57.119 --> 27:59.522
It's stupid.

27:59.555 --> 28:01.924
I feel stupid.

28:31.787 --> 28:33.890
I don't want to talk about it.

28:53.843 --> 28:56.479
I found Mom's diary.

29:03.719 --> 29:05.788
Did you look in it?

29:05.821 --> 29:09.125
I read the last page.

29:12.161 --> 29:14.096
What does it say?

29:20.203 --> 29:21.737
"I know he's there,

29:21.771 --> 29:23.472
in the darkness.

29:23.506 --> 29:24.573
Help me.

29:24.607 --> 29:26.909
Help me, please.

29:26.943 --> 29:29.145
He's killing David.

29:29.179 --> 29:32.249
He can't breathe anymore.

29:32.282 --> 29:35.185
There's nothing
I can do to stop it.

29:37.987 --> 29:40.623
Devil, devil, devil.

29:44.927 --> 29:48.864
He wants...

29:48.898 --> 29:53.002
David's soul."

30:03.612 --> 30:07.184
How'd she get up there?

30:07.217 --> 30:09.952
That cop said the tub,

30:09.986 --> 30:11.587
but you moved it.

30:13.756 --> 30:15.958
What?

30:15.992 --> 30:18.027
She was a couple feet in the air
where we found her.

30:18.060 --> 30:20.629
How'd she get
up there like that?

30:26.336 --> 30:28.637
I don't know.

30:32.342 --> 30:35.144
"The voices in my head...

30:38.614 --> 30:42.185
<i>His</i> voice...

30:42.219 --> 30:45.921
He makes me want to die.

30:45.955 --> 30:48.325
I locked the door,

30:48.358 --> 30:50.626
but he came inside the room.

30:50.659 --> 30:53.729
I want David to wake up.

30:53.763 --> 30:55.931
I grab his hand.
I squeeze it.

30:55.965 --> 30:57.833
- Wake up!"
- Please stop.

30:57.867 --> 31:00.603
"That sound...

31:00.636 --> 31:03.340
so many mouths.

31:03.373 --> 31:05.708
He climbs on the bed.

31:05.741 --> 31:07.176
He hurts David.

31:07.210 --> 31:09.078
- I can hear him."
- Louise!

31:09.111 --> 31:11.680
"I see him.

31:13.316 --> 31:15.185
He...

31:15.218 --> 31:18.621
He laughs at me.

31:18.654 --> 31:20.756
He kills me.

31:23.626 --> 31:25.195
I'm already dead.

31:28.331 --> 31:29.865
<i>I'm dead."</i>

31:50.119 --> 31:51.654
Thank you, Tim.

31:51.687 --> 31:54.623
I know you don't do this,
but we just...

31:54.657 --> 31:55.991

31:56.025 --> 31:57.626
You're fine, Mike.

32:06.168 --> 32:08.737
Thought you might like these.

32:08.771 --> 32:11.874
We found it in her pocket.

32:11.907 --> 32:13.310
What is it?

32:13.343 --> 32:17.347
Those are crosses
they give out in Sunday School.

32:17.380 --> 32:19.682
At least they did
when I was little.

32:23.986 --> 32:25.888
Maybe she collected them.

32:31.894 --> 32:35.030
She... She doesn't.

32:35.064 --> 32:41.070
She... She didn't... go.

32:41.103 --> 32:44.006
You want to get started
on the paperwork?

32:44.039 --> 32:45.208
Yes, please.

32:45.242 --> 32:46.675
Thank you.

33:33.822 --> 33:35.492
It's okay.

33:35.525 --> 33:36.892
It's okay.

33:36.926 --> 33:38.928
It's okay.

I...

34:20.836 --> 34:24.241
I thought there was a spider.

34:24.274 --> 34:27.876
There was a spider.

34:27.910 --> 34:29.912
Did you get it?

34:29.945 --> 34:31.880
Um...

34:34.850 --> 34:36.785
It was nothing.

34:51.534 --> 34:54.970
I'm gonna get some sleep.

34:55.004 --> 34:57.973
I'm gonna grab some groceries

But what if it's a lie.

42:40.903 --> 42:44.340
He won't stop.

42:44.373 --> 42:47.443
They will die.

42:47.477 --> 42:50.713
We're dead already.

42:50.747 --> 42:55.017
Spiders on my face like tears."

42:55.051 --> 42:57.553
Mm, my, my, my.

42:57.587 --> 42:59.288
Mm.

42:59.322 --> 43:01.357
I started coming to see her.

43:01.390 --> 43:02.892
She was...

43:02.925 --> 43:06.596
She was scared and alone.

43:09.031 --> 43:12.969
I was here for her.

43:13.002 --> 43:16.773
I-I wanted to meet you.

43:16.806 --> 43:21.711
She loves you both so much.

43:21.744 --> 43:23.045
I just thought...

43:23.079 --> 43:25.515
if you like, I can help.

43:25.548 --> 43:28.951
I think you've done enough.

43:28.985 --> 43:31.821
I didn't know about any of this.

43:34.123 --> 43:36.526
This didn't happen overnight.

43:36.559 --> 43:38.928
She had thoughts in her head.

43:38.961 --> 43:42.732
They came from somewhere.

43:42.765 --> 43:45.434
You came to the house.
You were here.

43:45.468 --> 43:48.104
You want to understand, yeah.

43:48.137 --> 43:50.873
She didn't believe in God.

43:50.907 --> 43:52.441
Never did.

43:52.475 --> 43:53.876
None of us do.

43:53.910 --> 43:56.813
My mom thought
the devil was here.

43:56.846 --> 43:58.714
She didn't believe.

43:58.748 --> 44:01.651
What does it matter
whether you believe.

44:01.684 --> 44:05.955
You think the wolf cares
if you believe he's a wolf?

44:05.988 --> 44:07.757
Hmm?

44:07.790 --> 44:11.894
Not if he finds you
alone in the woods.

44:11.928 --> 44:13.796
What did you say to her?

44:13.830 --> 44:18.067
I told her the... the truth.

44:18.100 --> 44:21.070
No, you told her <i>your</i> truth.

44:23.172 --> 44:24.874
Well, maybe so.

44:24.907 --> 44:26.642
Yeah, well, then I guess

44:26.676 --> 44:30.680
the same could be said
about you and yours.

44:33.149 --> 44:34.684
I think you need to go.

44:34.717 --> 44:36.853
- Michael.
- This isn't helping us.

44:36.886 --> 44:39.689
I didn't want to upset you.

44:39.722 --> 44:41.791
Well, you do,
and I'm not gonna sit here

44:41.824 --> 44:43.960
and pretend like
you didn't feed her this shit.

44:46.062 --> 44:49.031
She needed someone.

44:49.065 --> 44:53.536
I think you both
know that now, hmm?

44:53.569 --> 44:55.905
She was alone.

44:55.938 --> 44:59.041
They both were.

44:59.075 --> 45:01.110
I didn't do that.

45:01.143 --> 45:03.813
I helped.

45:03.846 --> 45:05.147
Did you?

45:05.182 --> 45:08.084
Yes. I did.

45:13.190 --> 45:15.625
- How's your father?
- He's fine.

45:15.658 --> 45:17.860
Well, that's good.

45:17.894 --> 45:19.795
I think about him a lot.

45:24.066 --> 45:27.003
You really think
the devil's out there?

45:27.036 --> 45:28.971
That's your truth?

45:34.176 --> 45:37.880
Your mama died, hmm.

45:37.914 --> 45:40.816
You heard her words,

45:40.850 --> 45:43.220
her warning.

45:43.253 --> 45:46.722
You think she's crazy
because she saw a wolf,

45:46.756 --> 45:50.159
saw him coming?

45:50.193 --> 45:53.963
He's not out there.

45:53.996 --> 45:56.632
He's already here.

46:35.171 --> 46:37.039
I don't know
what she wants to do.

46:37.073 --> 46:38.774
I can't tell.

46:38.808 --> 46:42.611
The whole thing's so fucked.

46:42.645 --> 46:44.847
I just want to come home.

46:44.880 --> 46:48.551
Mom was all I had left.

46:52.555 --> 46:54.924
I just miss her.

47:11.841 --> 47:14.043
Oh, no, you stay there.

47:14.076 --> 47:15.845
I told you.

47:20.850 --> 47:22.885
Baby, I walk around here, and...

47:22.918 --> 47:26.622
I don't feel anything.

47:46.343 --> 47:50.280
How are my babies?

47:50.313 --> 47:52.615
Give them a hug for me.

47:56.186 --> 47:58.788
I love you.

47:58.821 --> 48:01.724
"He...

48:01.757 --> 48:04.827
He is...

48:04.860 --> 48:06.629
watching.

48:08.265 --> 48:11.133
He waits.

48:11.167 --> 48:15.638
He is...

48:15.671 --> 48:18.741
everywhere."

48:28.918 --> 48:32.154
Michael?

48:36.659 --> 48:37.827
Hello?

48:40.963 --> 48:43.866
Is someone out there?

48:59.715 --> 49:01.817
She wasn't crazy.

49:04.354 --> 49:06.289
<i>I'm</i> not crazy.

49:08.858 --> 49:11.694
What if she saw something...

49:11.727 --> 49:13.129
out there?

49:17.334 --> 49:19.902
I saw something.

49:22.339 --> 49:24.974
And it wasn't a fuckin' dream.

49:26.842 --> 49:28.177
I wasn't imagining things,

49:28.211 --> 49:31.448
'cause that doesn't happen.

49:31.481 --> 49:33.416
Look at me.

49:40.290 --> 49:42.892
Mom was standing...

49:42.925 --> 49:44.693
right there.

49:49.266 --> 49:51.834
I saw it through the window

49:51.867 --> 49:53.436
last night.

49:57.840 --> 49:59.775
But it wasn't her.

50:03.413 --> 50:05.781
It was fucking scary, Louise.

50:08.518 --> 50:10.986
It can't be real.

50:59.868 --> 51:01.804
There's something out there.

51:45.981 --> 51:49.552
You should come outside.

51:49.586 --> 51:52.855
It's that priest.

51:52.888 --> 51:54.990
The hell?

52:12.542 --> 52:15.978
Come outside.

52:16.011 --> 52:18.047
What are you doing here?

52:18.080 --> 52:20.450
It's like 3:00 in the morning.

52:20.483 --> 52:23.919
Come outside.

52:23.952 --> 52:26.088
You can't just show up here!

52:29.292 --> 52:30.427
Wait.

52:30.460 --> 52:32.161
Don't wait.

52:37.667 --> 52:39.536
You want some rope?

52:40.603 --> 52:43.340
Oh, Jesus.

52:51.080 --> 52:52.248
Michael...

52:52.282 --> 52:54.049
Where'd he fucking go?

53:02.592 --> 53:03.959
He's not out here.

53:19.342 --> 53:21.009
Don't answer it.

53:25.715 --> 53:27.484
Don't!

53:44.334 --> 53:46.436
Come on.

53:48.571 --> 53:51.641
Come on, Michael.
Pick up the phone.

54:06.689 --> 54:08.391
Who's there?!

54:17.300 --> 54:18.967
Alright.

54:55.305 --> 54:57.674
You get out of here.
You don't belong here.

54:57.707 --> 54:59.275
You get, now, come on!

54:59.309 --> 55:02.044
Alright, demon, get.

55:15.391 --> 55:17.260
What do you want?

55:17.293 --> 55:18.461
What do you want?!

55:18.495 --> 55:19.729
Just... Just say it!

55:31.708 --> 55:36.679
<i>You did this to me.</i>

55:52.662 --> 55:54.230
There's no tracks,

55:54.264 --> 55:56.131
no footprints.

55:56.164 --> 55:58.100
Did Charlie ever meet the guy?

55:58.133 --> 55:59.469
Charlie hasn't answered
his phone in two days.

55:59.502 --> 56:00.670
I keep calling.

56:03.239 --> 56:05.542
He was just...
just standing out there,

56:05.575 --> 56:08.143
just waiting for me.

56:08.176 --> 56:10.280
We take dad to a hospital.

56:13.850 --> 56:16.386
We can't keep him here,
not anymore.

56:22.725 --> 56:25.194
We'll get the doctor out here.

56:27.497 --> 56:30.132
You saw his face, didn't you?

56:33.303 --> 56:34.270
You saw it when the...

56:34.304 --> 56:36.071
It can't be real.

56:57.493 --> 56:59.195
Father Thorne?

56:59.228 --> 57:00.563
<i>Who is this?</i>

57:00.597 --> 57:02.465
This is Louise Straker.

57:02.498 --> 57:04.867
We met yesterday.

57:04.901 --> 57:06.903
You came to see us.

57:06.936 --> 57:09.505
<i>Well,
how did you get this number?</i>

57:09.539 --> 57:12.275
You gave it to me.

57:12.308 --> 57:16.245
<i>This is a hotel.
Y-You called my room.</i>

57:16.279 --> 57:18.648
<i>Where are you calling from?</i>

57:18.681 --> 57:20.550
I'm in Thurber.

57:20.583 --> 57:22.285
You were here yesterday.

57:22.318 --> 57:24.520
We met yesterday.
You know my mother.

57:24.554 --> 57:26.222
<i>Thurber? Where is...</i>

57:26.255 --> 57:27.657
You were here.

57:29.325 --> 57:31.527
Thurber.

57:31.561 --> 57:33.596
Thurber, Texas.

57:33.630 --> 57:36.199
<i>I've never been to Texas.</i>

57:36.232 --> 57:38.166
<i>I'm in Chicago.</i>

57:41.971 --> 57:43.673
You don't know Virginia Straker?

57:43.706 --> 57:44.907
<i>Are you trying to be funny?</i>

57:44.941 --> 57:46.776
- But...
- <i>Her name was Louise.</i>

57:46.809 --> 57:48.578
Wait.

57:48.611 --> 57:52.548
<i>I guess
you know that, don't you?</i>

57:52.582 --> 57:56.219
<i>You know I had a daughter.</i>

57:56.252 --> 57:58.454
I don't know how.

57:58.488 --> 58:01.791
Sir, I didn't...
I didn't mean to...

58:01.824 --> 58:03.760
<i>She killed herself...</i>

58:03.793 --> 58:05.895
<i>a long time ago.</i>

58:08.331 --> 58:11.367
<i>Why would you do this?</i>

58:11.401 --> 58:15.371
Sir, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean...

58:15.405 --> 58:17.340
<i>You sound just like her.</i>

58:41.330 --> 58:44.367
Have you, um...

58:44.400 --> 58:48.337
noticed any changes
since you've arrived?

58:48.371 --> 58:50.573
We just want to take him
to a hospital,

58:50.606 --> 58:53.509
so do we need
to fill out some forms

58:53.543 --> 58:56.279
or whatever you need.

58:56.312 --> 58:58.614
I doubt he'd make it
to the highway.

59:01.818 --> 59:04.554
He's getting weaker every day,

59:04.587 --> 59:06.289
and I don't think I can just...

59:06.322 --> 59:08.691
A whole lot has changed.

59:08.725 --> 59:12.829
But I can't sign off
on moving him.

59:12.862 --> 59:16.432
It's just too late for that.

59:16.466 --> 59:18.434
He shouldn't be here.

59:20.603 --> 59:22.004
Is there a problem
with his treatment?

59:22.038 --> 59:23.406
You're not listening.

59:23.439 --> 59:25.341
- I'm trying.
- It's our choice.

59:25.374 --> 59:27.343
And I can't let you kill him.

59:32.682 --> 59:35.818
We just want him safe.

59:58.875 --> 1:00:01.611
You must see people
at their weakest.

1:00:01.644 --> 1:00:03.746
It's got to take a toll on you.

1:00:05.715 --> 1:00:09.318
It's not all I see.

1:00:09.352 --> 1:00:11.621
There's a lot of love.

1:00:13.890 --> 1:00:16.859
It's a silly thing to say,
but it's true.

1:00:18.661 --> 1:00:22.598
Sometimes I'm the only one...

1:00:22.632 --> 1:00:24.901
when it happens, you know.

1:00:27.370 --> 1:00:30.006
I'm just...

1:00:30.039 --> 1:00:31.841
the worst thing in the world

1:00:31.874 --> 1:00:35.044
to me is...
for a person to die alone.

1:00:43.786 --> 1:00:45.888
My mom...

1:00:45.922 --> 1:00:50.726
She thought something
was coming for him.

1:00:50.760 --> 1:00:53.496
My dad was good.

1:00:53.529 --> 1:00:57.133
Michael...

1:00:57.166 --> 1:00:59.635
I can see the fear in y'all.

1:01:03.039 --> 1:01:05.007
I can feel it in this house.

1:01:07.977 --> 1:01:10.112
I know y'all don't
believe in God,

1:01:10.146 --> 1:01:13.916
and that's fine...

1:01:13.950 --> 1:01:16.853
but I do,

1:01:16.886 --> 1:01:19.622
and I think there are
things in this world...

1:01:19.655 --> 1:01:23.559
horrible things...

1:01:23.593 --> 1:01:24.994
wicked...

1:01:27.730 --> 1:01:30.900
...and they come
for whoever they want.

1:01:30.933 --> 1:01:34.770
But there's love here.

1:01:36.806 --> 1:01:39.442
And a soul needs love
to keep it safe.

1:01:42.178 --> 1:01:44.847
I hope you're right.

1:01:44.881 --> 1:01:46.983
So do I.

1:03:03.226 --> 1:03:04.593
Wolves wouldn't do this...

1:03:04.627 --> 1:03:06.829
not this way, not like this.

1:03:06.862 --> 1:03:07.964
No.

1:03:12.202 --> 1:03:15.104
I'll call another hospital.

1:03:15.137 --> 1:03:17.240
Get another doctor
here tomorrow.

1:03:21.677 --> 1:03:24.647
She told us not to come.

1:03:24.680 --> 1:03:28.684
God damn it!

1:03:53.142 --> 1:03:56.579
How many are still out there?

1:03:56.612 --> 1:03:58.948
I don't know.

1:03:58.981 --> 1:04:01.083
Five, maybe.

1:04:04.887 --> 1:04:07.623
We check again in the morning,

1:04:07.656 --> 1:04:11.027
but I think we got
what was left.

1:04:11.060 --> 1:04:12.928
There was a mama due.

1:04:12.962 --> 1:04:15.232
I saw her.

1:04:15.265 --> 1:04:19.568
I'm gonna go out there
and sit with them,

1:04:19.602 --> 1:04:21.704
- make sure...
- Don't.

1:04:24.173 --> 1:04:26.642
Well, I'm not just
gonna let them die.

1:04:28.744 --> 1:04:31.281
Not today.

1:04:31.314 --> 1:04:34.284
If I'm here, I'm gonna work.

1:04:36.186 --> 1:04:38.288
Then let me go with you.

1:04:40.923 --> 1:04:43.125
You stay with him.

1:04:44.894 --> 1:04:47.297
Please.

1:04:47.330 --> 1:04:51.033
I was in there with Dad
earlier today,

1:04:51.067 --> 1:04:54.204
and that nurse said something
that's been sticking with me.

1:04:56.005 --> 1:05:00.176
There's nothing worse than
a soul left alone in the end.

1:05:04.914 --> 1:05:08.684
She wanted me to feel something,

1:05:08.717 --> 1:05:12.721
and I wanted to feel something.

1:05:20.796 --> 1:05:23.766
Now I just want to forget
about this place.

I'm okay.
I just...

It's nothing.

I'm Charlie's granddaughter.

I guess she wanted someone here
to know.

1:14:15.632 --> 1:14:17.667
My grandpa died.

He, um...

1:14:22.772 --> 1:14:26.542
He shot himself two nights ago.

1:14:26.576 --> 1:14:29.312

1:14:29.345 --> 1:14:31.381
I don't...

1:14:31.414 --> 1:14:34.450
Charlie died?

1:14:34.484 --> 1:14:37.620

He was here. No.

1:14:49.265 --> 1:14:51.634
I just saw him.
That's not possible.

1:14:51.668 --> 1:14:53.403
They found him.

1:15:00.843 --> 1:15:03.279
I'm sorry about your mama.

I smell him, too.

1:15:55.631 --> 1:15:58.601
He's close now.
