<i>In New York City's
war on crime,</i>

00:09.256 --> 00:11.224
<i>the worst criminal offenders
are pursued</i>

00:11.291 --> 00:14.260
<i>by the detectives
of the Major Case Squad.</i>

00:14.328 --> 00:15.989
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:18.565 --> 00:19.930
To our friend Taylor.

00:20.000 --> 00:20.989
To Taylor.
Taylor.

00:21.068 --> 00:23.730
Who's leaving us for the New
York City Fire Department.

00:23.804 --> 00:25.669
FDNY!

00:25.739 --> 00:27.536
FDNY!

00:27.941 --> 00:30.341
Hey, Taylor, when were you
going to tell us you passed?

00:30.410 --> 00:33.436
You know me.

00:34.047 --> 00:36.379
I like to keep
things to myself.

00:37.884 --> 00:40.546
Glad to hear it.
To Taylor.

00:41.088 --> 00:42.419
To Taylor!

00:48.195 --> 00:49.856
Come back to bed.

00:52.566 --> 00:54.090
In a minute.

00:55.569 --> 00:57.503
You're gonna be
all right, honey.

00:57.571 --> 01:00.301
Just two more weeks
and it'll be over.

01:04.944 --> 01:07.505
I can't even get
three hours a night.

01:07.581 --> 01:10.550
You can bite these in half.
It should do the job.

01:10.617 --> 01:13.484
Don't want you falling
off the fire truck.

01:15.389 --> 01:17.448
Not a lot of secrets in here.

01:17.524 --> 01:18.650
Gina.

01:20.394 --> 01:22.259
This one's
throwing up.

01:24.197 --> 01:25.994
I'll be right there.

01:28.835 --> 01:30.496
You're so lucky.

01:34.975 --> 01:36.306
Come on.

01:40.680 --> 01:44.241
All right, sweetie. Stay in
touch. I'll talk to you soon.

01:51.458 --> 01:52.857
So what'd she say
about Taylor?

01:52.926 --> 01:55.417
She's worried.
He's not sleeping.

01:55.796 --> 01:58.196
He's working out,
running stairs.

01:58.565 --> 02:01.898
She hopes he'll settle down
once the new job starts.

02:03.537 --> 02:05.732
Push it. Push it.

02:07.000 --> 02:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:29.663 --> 02:31.756
You dropped something!

03:26.486 --> 03:28.249
Looks like a puncture
wound to the throat.

03:28.321 --> 03:30.289
Name's Taylor Kenna,

03:30.357 --> 03:32.848
lives on the second floor
with his wife and two kids.

03:32.926 --> 03:35.417
And here he is on
the fifth floor.

03:35.595 --> 03:38.496
The fact you're here, we owe that to
Kenna being a guard at Brooklyn Fed?

03:38.565 --> 03:40.123
The Bureau
of Prisons asked us in.

03:40.200 --> 03:42.634
This was called in as
a "police officer down. "

03:42.702 --> 03:44.294
Yeah. By the patrolman who found Kenna.

03:44.371 --> 03:46.669
We'd like to
talk to him.

03:49.209 --> 03:52.474
Ankle weights. I'd guess
he was running the stairs.

03:52.779 --> 03:54.576
This
is Officer Liss.

03:54.648 --> 03:56.980
Officer,
on your radio call,

03:57.050 --> 03:59.018
you made Kenna
as a police officer?

03:59.085 --> 04:01.076
The super
said he was PD.

04:01.855 --> 04:03.755
Anyone touch the body?

04:03.990 --> 04:06.185
He was like that
when I got here.

04:06.259 --> 04:11.322
The reason why I ask is, you
see these blood stains here?

04:11.731 --> 04:15.292
It looks like the blood soaked
into his pants from the inside.

04:15.368 --> 04:20.168
You have any idea how blood got
on the inside of Kenna's pants?

04:22.709 --> 04:25.974
Maybe when you found the
body, the pants were down.

04:26.646 --> 04:28.705
Yeah, okay,
his jingus was out.

04:28.782 --> 04:30.841
I didn't think a brother
officer needed his wife knowing

04:30.917 --> 04:33.681
he got shivved getting hooker service.

04:33.753 --> 04:34.879
Look, I thought
he was a cop.

04:34.955 --> 04:39.415
Next time, remember that you're a cop
and do not disturb the crime scene.

04:39.492 --> 04:42.825
Taylor?
Oh, no! Taylor, no!

04:43.663 --> 04:45.995
That would be
the victim's wife.

04:47.067 --> 04:49.763
He'd just passed his
Fire Department exam.

04:51.771 --> 04:53.864
He started in two weeks.

04:55.976 --> 04:58.410
He carry ID when he went jogging?

04:59.212 --> 05:00.770
His wallet.

05:02.916 --> 05:04.713
They took his wallet?

05:05.919 --> 05:09.446
He carried a picture
of us, at the prom...

05:11.658 --> 05:14.593
We'll try and get that
picture back for you.

05:14.995 --> 05:17.793
Now, you slept here?

05:17.864 --> 05:19.627
It's a small place.

05:20.100 --> 05:22.694
When the kids came, we wanted
them to have their own room.

05:22.769 --> 05:28.002
Okay. These scratches,
they go from here, to here.

05:28.742 --> 05:31.734
Is that because you
moved the bed around?

05:31.811 --> 05:33.608
Was one of you
having trouble sleeping?

05:33.680 --> 05:38.140
Taylor was. He even went and got
pills from the infirmary at work.

05:38.485 --> 05:40.578
He was worried
about his new job?

05:40.654 --> 05:43.248
He should've been
walking on air.

05:43.323 --> 05:46.019
He'd been wanting to leave
his prison job for years.

05:46.092 --> 05:48.822
Is that because he wasn't
proud of working there?

05:48.895 --> 05:52.797
Is that why he let the super
think that he was a cop?

05:52.866 --> 05:55.130
He never told anyone he
was a correction officer.

05:56.903 --> 05:58.234
Excuse me.

05:59.606 --> 06:02.905
Smart. Lots of ex-cons
with beefs around.

06:04.744 --> 06:08.771
Kenna kept his wife's
prom picture in his wallet,

06:10.183 --> 06:12.208
trying to better himself.

06:13.453 --> 06:15.182
They keep
their home tidy.

06:15.255 --> 06:17.689
No chaos. Good people live here.

06:18.658 --> 06:23.152
So how did Kenna end up in a stairwell
with his pants around his ankles?

06:23.997 --> 06:25.396
No sign of saliva,

06:25.465 --> 06:28.457
lubricant or other fluids
on Mr. Kenna's genitals.

06:28.535 --> 06:31.026
The pay date could've just
been giving him a hand.

06:31.104 --> 06:33.629
These lesions,
one on each thigh...

06:35.842 --> 06:39.835
<i>We have a lesion 4 centimeters
long by a half-centimeter wide.</i>

06:40.313 --> 06:41.337
Same on the right.

06:41.414 --> 06:44.281
They go from pink at the top of
the lesion to red at the bottom.

06:44.350 --> 06:48.514
So, his pants were yanked
down hard by the killer.

06:49.289 --> 06:51.086
These marks were left
by the killer's fingers.

06:51.157 --> 06:53.284
Well, someone was anxious
to get down to business.

06:53.359 --> 06:56.192
Or maybe it was done
after Kenna was stabbed.

06:56.262 --> 06:59.026
The killer staged the
scene to throw us off.

06:59.099 --> 07:02.125
And humiliate him.
A personal vendetta?

07:02.202 --> 07:05.968
Jailhouse payback. Maybe that's
what was keeping him up nights.

07:10.410 --> 07:12.537
These are all the inmates
released in the last year

07:12.612 --> 07:14.944
who had contact with Kenna.

07:15.014 --> 07:18.677
It doesn't seem like a lot. You
got how many prisoners here? 2,000?

07:18.752 --> 07:21.084
1,929.

07:21.788 --> 07:24.655
Kenna worked C-Block,
the Protective Custody Wing.

07:24.724 --> 07:26.749
It's a small population, less than 100.

07:27.927 --> 07:31.624
Unit Counselor Plumm, he's in
charge of the COs on Kenna's shift.

07:31.698 --> 07:32.687
Hi.

07:32.766 --> 07:34.597
How would you rate Kenna
as a correction officer?

07:34.667 --> 07:38.125
The guy's good. No yellow
cards for excessive force.

07:38.605 --> 07:40.573
Do you think you could
cherry-pick the inmates

07:40.640 --> 07:41.834
that he had conflicts with?

07:41.908 --> 07:42.897
Sure.

07:42.976 --> 07:44.807
Somebody known
for their knife work.

07:45.845 --> 07:47.972
There's Lawrence Chulack.

07:48.047 --> 07:50.140
He claimed that Kenna
turned his back on him,

07:50.216 --> 07:52.275
and that's a major
diss in our world.

07:52.352 --> 07:55.219
Paroled to Arizona.
Long hike back to Brooklyn

07:55.288 --> 07:56.778
for a little payback.

07:56.856 --> 07:59.916
James Girunda. He was
released six weeks ago.

08:01.127 --> 08:04.961
Kenna busted him for "double clothes.
" That's a shirt over a shirt.

08:05.031 --> 08:08.831
An inmate can attack someone, then
discard the top shirt to disguise himself.

08:08.902 --> 08:12.269
Girunda was in for assaulting
a mailman with a knife.

08:12.505 --> 08:16.407
And is nicknamed "Chocolate Jimmy.
" How'd he get that nickname?

08:20.046 --> 08:22.412
Anything to do with the reason
he was in the Protected Wing?

08:22.482 --> 08:26.748
Yeah, his sexual activities
caused disturbances in A-Block.

08:27.687 --> 08:30.781
If Kenna harassed Chocolate
Jimmy for being gay,

08:31.958 --> 08:37.089
ending up dead with his pants down
sounds like the appropriate payback.

08:37.163 --> 08:38.255
Hmm.

08:39.332 --> 08:43.530
Kenna, yeah,
I remember him. Sure.

08:43.602 --> 08:46.629
You had a dust-up with him
for wearing double clothes.

08:46.706 --> 08:51.234
He had me strip down to my kimono, so
all the people in the galleries could see.

08:51.311 --> 08:52.744
You probably
liked that!

08:52.812 --> 08:55.337
Shut up, Ma,
they're talking to me!

08:58.618 --> 09:03.055
Is your mom right, Jimmy,
or did you feel humiliated?

09:03.323 --> 09:07.726
I'm no Anna Nicole. I don't
like being made a spectacle.

09:08.094 --> 09:10.824
Then you'll be happy to know
Guard Kenna was stabbed to death

09:10.897 --> 09:12.626
in his building
two days ago.

09:12.699 --> 09:14.667
Do you know anything
about that, Jimmy?

09:14.734 --> 09:18.830
He doesn't know anything. He
just sits around, eating biscuits.

09:19.405 --> 09:20.872
"Get a hobby,"
I tell him.

09:20.940 --> 09:22.703
I know things, Ma!

09:22.775 --> 09:26.336
Ungrateful biscuit-eating
son of a bitch.

09:26.679 --> 09:29.978
You know, Jimmy, I think
that your mother is right.

09:30.984 --> 09:33.145
We mistook you for somebody
who'd know something.

09:33.219 --> 09:37.155
I do. I know they found
Kenna with his pants down.

09:37.824 --> 09:39.314
Sounds like you
were there, Jimmy.

09:39.392 --> 09:42.054
I was. I shivved him
through the throat.

09:42.128 --> 09:44.426
Music to our ears, Jimmy.
You're under arrest.

09:44.497 --> 09:47.591
This will teach you, Ma.
Try living without me!

09:47.667 --> 09:49.430
She's probably
used to it.

09:49.502 --> 09:52.096
You mind? I got my little
bag there by the cot,

09:52.171 --> 09:54.298
with my things
I'm gonna need.

09:55.608 --> 09:58.975
Yeah, sure. Hang on, guys.

10:09.555 --> 10:11.216
Yeah, the kimono,

10:13.293 --> 10:15.784
HIV meds,
toiletries, makeup...

10:15.862 --> 10:19.559
Everything for a long trip.
Almost like he expected us.

10:21.034 --> 10:24.800
Jimmy, when you were convicted,
what'd they have on you?

10:26.072 --> 10:28.097
Witnesses,
fingerprints?

10:28.841 --> 10:30.103
Nothing.

10:30.710 --> 10:33.076
I couldn't live
with the guilt.

10:33.479 --> 10:36.471
I confessed.
See you never, Ma!

10:36.549 --> 10:37.811
Ingrate!

10:41.854 --> 10:45.051
Maybe Jimmy does have
a hobby. Confessing.

10:45.124 --> 10:49.117
Yeah, I don't think we're the
only ones that know that about him.

10:52.598 --> 10:55.499
He was running up,
I was running down,

10:55.568 --> 10:57.126
I shivved him
and that was that.

10:58.037 --> 11:00.733
Which hand did you stab him with again?

11:03.176 --> 11:06.270
The one I had to,
to get the job done.

11:06.346 --> 11:11.113
Jimmy, we think that someone put you up
to taking the weight for this killing.

11:11.184 --> 11:14.620
Maybe one of your prison pals
called you, fed you some details.

11:14.687 --> 11:16.587
You know
they knew that you...

11:16.656 --> 11:21.423
Well, you like taking credit for
some things that you haven't done.

11:22.362 --> 11:25.559
Jimmy, let's talk
about this.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.534
A compulsive
confessor.

11:30.003 --> 11:31.197
We had a lady
at my old precinct

11:31.270 --> 11:33.101
used to come in with a new
confession every week,

11:33.172 --> 11:34.503
just for the attention.

11:34.574 --> 11:37.600
Can we find out who primed
Mr. Girunda's pump?

11:38.411 --> 11:40.208
We're tracking
his comings and goings,

11:40.279 --> 11:42.679
pulling his phone records,
see who called him.

11:42.749 --> 11:45.240
Maybe we'll find
who put him up to this.

11:48.788 --> 11:50.221
Are you sure that call
came from my cell phone?

11:50.289 --> 11:53.122
Because I got an unlocked
phone and I paid cash for it.

11:53.192 --> 11:55.922
Except every few weeks, Sami, when
you load it up with more minutes,

11:55.995 --> 11:59.692
you charge them on your credit
card, which makes it traceable.

11:59.766 --> 12:02.462
Wait, I'm all confused,
because, like,

12:02.535 --> 12:04.298
I lost the phone, and
then I got a new one,

12:04.370 --> 12:07.203
and this call's coming
from the phone I lost.

12:07.273 --> 12:09.298
Forget it, let's just
talk to the other girl.

12:09.375 --> 12:10.399
What other girl?

12:10.476 --> 12:14.845
Well, there were a lot of calls
on your... Was it lost phone?

12:16.049 --> 12:17.311
To a girl in Queens.

12:17.383 --> 12:19.908
Mostly
late-night, long calls.

12:20.386 --> 12:21.910
That sleaze.

12:21.988 --> 12:22.977
Yeah.

12:26.292 --> 12:29.693
Billy Duval. He's at the
federal prison in Brooklyn.

12:29.762 --> 12:31.627
He got me cash
to give him a phone,

12:31.697 --> 12:33.426
and I gave it to a guy
who came by the office.

12:33.499 --> 12:34.488
Who was the guy?

12:34.567 --> 12:36.034
Some guy I don't know.

12:36.102 --> 12:39.560
Well, you'd better tell your
boss you're leaving early.

12:42.542 --> 12:46.103
Cell phones in prison. I
must've missed that commercial.

12:46.946 --> 12:50.677
Yeah, the trick is, how
do you get the cell phone

12:51.584 --> 12:53.279
by the prison security?

12:53.352 --> 12:54.944
It's impossible.

12:56.122 --> 12:57.885
Except for a guard.

12:58.558 --> 13:00.992
Yeah, I heard what
happened about Guard Kenna.

13:01.060 --> 13:02.960
Life's harsh
in the free world.

13:03.029 --> 13:05.497
Did you also hear Chocolate
Jimmy's taking the rap?

13:05.565 --> 13:06.554
I don't know him.

13:06.632 --> 13:09.226
He was in the Protected
Wing same time you were.

13:09.302 --> 13:12.100
See that phone
there, Billy?

13:12.171 --> 13:13.195
Yeah.

13:13.272 --> 13:15.763
They found it when they tossed your
cell. Your prints are all over it.

13:15.842 --> 13:19.278
Cell phones in here get
passed around. Lots of fingers.

13:19.345 --> 13:22.178
This one's your very own
special cell phone, Billy.

13:22.248 --> 13:25.046
Your girlfriend Sami admitted
putting minutes on it.

13:25.118 --> 13:28.485
Not for me. She likes
cons. She's known here.

13:28.788 --> 13:30.380
She like guards?

13:31.924 --> 13:34.085
You know, guards who
smuggle in cell phones?

13:34.160 --> 13:36.219
Guards like Taylor Kenna?

13:36.295 --> 13:39.924
Billy, five of those minutes were
spent calling Chocolate Jimmy.

13:39.999 --> 13:40.988
What'd you tell him?

13:41.067 --> 13:43.558
I don't know him,
he don't know me.

13:45.805 --> 13:48.137
You can go.

13:50.510 --> 13:52.603
You okay there, pal?
Yeah.

14:01.754 --> 14:05.986
Pain when he got up. Acne, not
just on his face, but on his back.

14:06.058 --> 14:10.495
Steroids. Wonder if he got them in
the same place he got that cell phone.

14:11.664 --> 14:15.031
Almost a third of the population
of the Protected Wing are wise guys

14:15.101 --> 14:16.693
from half a dozen families.

14:16.769 --> 14:19.431
Kenna might've been in business
with them, smuggling in contraband.

14:19.505 --> 14:20.733
If he tried
to rip them off...

14:20.806 --> 14:23.331
Killing a guard,
setting up a patsy,

14:24.410 --> 14:26.878
projecting that kind
of power in a prison,

14:26.946 --> 14:28.413
nobody does it
better than the Mob.

14:28.481 --> 14:32.247
Agreed. But if you're saying he was
killed to protect a criminal enterprise,

14:32.318 --> 14:33.808
where's the criminal
enterprise?

14:33.886 --> 14:36.446
Well, you need
proof of drug use?

14:36.522 --> 14:39.514
Prisons do random drug-testing.
Steroids would show up.

14:39.592 --> 14:43.756
And the results of such tests
would be a matter of public record.

14:43.829 --> 14:48.266
Five percent of the population testing
positive for drugs is standard for prisons.

14:48.334 --> 14:51.167
The Protected Wing, they're
getting less than 1%% positives.

14:51.237 --> 14:53.831
It's a smaller unit,
with stricter monitoring.

14:53.906 --> 14:55.601
Who's doing
the testing?

14:55.675 --> 14:57.540
Nurse Lowe
collects the samples.

14:57.610 --> 14:59.908
She's been told
you might have questions.

14:59.979 --> 15:02.413
Check in with me
when you're done.

15:03.783 --> 15:05.148
Nurse Lowe?

15:06.185 --> 15:09.177
I'm Detective Goren,
this is Detective Eames.

15:11.257 --> 15:15.990
Look, we were surprised by the good
results on the drug tests in C-Block.

15:16.462 --> 15:20.228
No surprise.
Off the record?

15:22.168 --> 15:26.298
Once a week, the computer generates
a list of inmates to be tested.

15:26.372 --> 15:28.670
It goes through
a lot of hands.

15:29.141 --> 15:33.407
The inmates get the heads-up, so
they get to study for their tests.

15:33.479 --> 15:35.640
They use masking agents
to beat the tests.

15:35.715 --> 15:37.205
If you say so.

15:38.117 --> 15:42.349
Maybe the warden told you why
we're here. Guard Kenna's murder?

15:42.421 --> 15:46.482
He might've been involved in
smuggling contraband into the prison.

15:46.759 --> 15:50.661
If you think about anything
and you want to talk to us...

15:53.599 --> 15:56.796
Of his crew,
Kenna was the good guy.

15:57.603 --> 15:59.935
His "crew. "
You mean his shift?

16:02.775 --> 16:04.436
Paramedic science.

16:04.977 --> 16:07.070
You studying
to be a paramedic?

16:07.146 --> 16:08.773
Six months to go.

16:08.848 --> 16:11.180
You're counting
the days. Just like Kenna.

16:11.250 --> 16:13.241
His wife said he couldn't
wait to get out of here.

16:13.319 --> 16:14.343
I was happy for him.

16:14.420 --> 16:16.251
You would think
he would be happy, too.

16:16.322 --> 16:18.722
But, instead,
he wasn't sleeping.

16:22.328 --> 16:26.560
He came in here for help. Do
you know what was keeping him up?

16:26.632 --> 16:27.690
No.

16:28.968 --> 16:30.731
Was Kenna in a jam?

16:36.275 --> 16:39.335
He was a good guy,
he had a good heart.

16:39.412 --> 16:40.811
Hey, Gina...

16:43.082 --> 16:45.550
I don't have anything more to say.

16:51.490 --> 16:53.390
She was rock-steady
on the drug questions,

16:53.459 --> 16:56.622
but as soon as we started
in on Kenna, she got hinky.

16:56.696 --> 16:58.960
She said he had
a good heart,

16:59.031 --> 17:01.932
said she was happy
to see him getting out.

17:05.771 --> 17:08.296
She wasn't talking
about smuggling.

17:08.773 --> 17:09.934
She was thinking
about something else,

17:10.009 --> 17:13.240
something she was
terrified to talk about.

17:13.311 --> 17:14.676
Kenna's nightmares,

17:14.747 --> 17:17.840
I don't think they had
anything to do with contraband.

17:21.420 --> 17:23.980
Hey, our boy did
okay with the cops.

17:24.656 --> 17:26.750
He's sorry
about the phone.

17:30.229 --> 17:31.662
Carbonara?

17:34.433 --> 17:36.230
Sleeping like babies, sir.

17:37.136 --> 17:39.866
Maybe we should wake them for a feeding.

17:52.451 --> 17:54.749
The guards
on Taylor's shift...

17:54.820 --> 17:57.015
<i>I didn't know you could
play Twister by yourself.</i>

17:57.089 --> 18:01.219
Last month, Brooklyn Fed
says they tested 700 inmates,

18:01.293 --> 18:04.456
or 36%% of the
total population.

18:04.530 --> 18:08.330
Now, if 700 is 36%%,

18:10.069 --> 18:12.367
what is the total
population?

18:14.039 --> 18:16.667
1,946.

18:18.477 --> 18:23.073
Their official manifest
reports a population of 1,929.

18:24.550 --> 18:26.848
They're off
by 17 inmates.

18:26.919 --> 18:29.615
Turnover could explain
the discrepancy.

18:29.889 --> 18:31.982
You know,
there's 18 months here.

18:32.057 --> 18:34.855
The total number of
prisoners, it fluctuates,

18:37.730 --> 18:40.096
but the discrepancy,
it doesn't.

18:41.734 --> 18:44.202
It's always 17 to 20 off.

18:46.205 --> 18:48.230
Unofficial prisoners.

18:51.377 --> 18:55.541
You know, the drug stats,
they're broken down by cell block.

18:56.549 --> 18:58.779
The discrepancy
is in C-Block.

19:00.519 --> 19:03.010
The Captain's a mathlete,
he's gonna love this.

19:03.088 --> 19:07.149
Captain, with all due respect, I'd
like a word with this Detective Goren.

19:07.226 --> 19:09.717
Now, look, I just want to know
what all the questions were about.

19:09.795 --> 19:13.788
Detective Mike Logan, meet
Detective Eames and Detective Goren.

19:14.300 --> 19:18.396
That nurse at Brooklyn Fed happens
to be Detective Logan's girlfriend.

19:18.471 --> 19:19.699
This yours?

19:19.772 --> 19:20.796
Yeah.

19:20.873 --> 19:22.397
You forgot it.

19:22.741 --> 19:25.505
Detective Logan has a beef
about the way she was treated.

19:25.578 --> 19:27.102
She complained to you?

19:27.179 --> 19:28.737
Well, not in
so many words.

19:28.814 --> 19:30.304
Well, that's not
her style, right?

19:30.382 --> 19:33.215
It takes a lot
to get her to open up.

19:34.320 --> 19:36.447
You telling me
about my girlfriend?

19:36.522 --> 19:39.923
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean it that way.

19:41.560 --> 19:44.723
You're investigating the
murder of a CO from her prison.

19:44.797 --> 19:46.788
So, I'm gonna ask you again.
Is she suspected of something?

19:46.866 --> 19:48.026
You know we can't
tell you that.

19:48.100 --> 19:49.465
I've been a detective
for 18 years.

19:49.535 --> 19:51.526
I think I'd like
to join this party.

19:51.604 --> 19:52.935
As you said,
we're Major Case.

19:53.005 --> 19:55.769
Let me discuss it
with my detectives.

19:56.108 --> 19:59.635
No problem. Maybe I'll have
some of your major coffee.

20:02.815 --> 20:07.343
Please sit at my desk.
It's one from the gun lockers.

20:10.756 --> 20:14.419
So, this is the Logan that threw a
punch at a city councilman 10 years ago.

20:14.493 --> 20:16.688
Made him a hero
to guys like my dad.

20:16.762 --> 20:18.821
Not to the guys upstairs.

20:18.898 --> 20:21.628
He's been buried in
Staten Island ever since.

20:21.700 --> 20:23.099
Say the word,
I'll get rid of him.

20:23.168 --> 20:27.332
No, I think that it would be good
to have someone like him around,

20:27.406 --> 20:31.172
you know, someone
who Gina trusts.

20:31.577 --> 20:33.602
Only if we can trust him.

20:36.448 --> 20:38.973
Get me Lieutenant
Van Buren at the 27.

20:39.051 --> 20:40.678
You two have
something for me?

20:40.753 --> 20:43.187
Somebody's short-counting prisoners.

20:52.565 --> 20:54.999
She says he's a hothead, he's honest,

20:55.067 --> 20:57.934
and she's tried three times
to get him back on her squad.

20:58.003 --> 21:01.131
This short count. Correction
officers never stop counting.

21:01.206 --> 21:03.003
Counting is what
COs always get right.

21:03.075 --> 21:05.543
So secret prisoners?

21:05.611 --> 21:07.579
If anybody'd know
about secret prisoners,

21:07.646 --> 21:11.514
it'd be the nurse who's treating
them, but she won't talk to us.

21:11.584 --> 21:14.052
Well, let's see
how good Logan is.

21:17.323 --> 21:18.312
Okay.

21:19.758 --> 21:20.918
Logan.

21:22.194 --> 21:23.286
Should I bring
my toothbrush?

21:25.698 --> 21:29.259
Your girlfriend Gina, you've been
seeing her less than a year, six months?

21:29.335 --> 21:33.601
Five months. I met her on the ferry
to Staten Island, where she lives.

21:34.607 --> 21:38.771
She ever mention to you
the Protected Wing, C-Block?

21:39.011 --> 21:40.603
It's where the
dead guard worked.

21:40.679 --> 21:42.374
Something's going on there.

21:42.448 --> 21:45.645
Maybe your girlfriend knows,
she's afraid to talk.

21:46.852 --> 21:47.910
She didn't
tell you that?

21:47.987 --> 21:50.512
That's odd,
you being her boyfriend.

21:50.756 --> 21:54.021
Hey, I'm not
resenting this at all.

21:54.093 --> 21:56.891
Listen to yourself.
You are too involved.

21:58.097 --> 22:01.089
We don't gain anything
adding you to the team.

22:05.938 --> 22:07.735
Right. Okay.

22:12.978 --> 22:15.469
No chance he'll stay out of it now.

22:15.781 --> 22:19.774
I really wish you hadn't talked
to them. Now can we just drop it?

22:38.070 --> 22:41.904
I'm gonna take a shower and then
we'll have dinner, all right?

22:42.808 --> 22:43.968
Great.

22:51.984 --> 22:53.576
Why's that open?

22:57.289 --> 22:59.086
Were you snooping on me
while I was out?

22:59.158 --> 23:00.921
You gotta let me help you.

23:00.993 --> 23:05.225
You want to help me? Just don't be
here when I get out of the shower!

23:06.865 --> 23:08.856
Okay. I'll get my stuff.

23:31.123 --> 23:32.556
I'm leaving.

23:36.762 --> 23:38.992
Come on, Gina.
What are you...

23:44.136 --> 23:45.933
It was an index card.

23:46.405 --> 23:49.772
I left it in the book, so
she wouldn't know I found it.

23:50.309 --> 23:52.937
On one side was written,
"Dear Mom, I'm fine,

23:53.011 --> 23:56.742
"but I'm suffering from Uncle
Harry's illness. " Signed, AZ.

23:57.149 --> 23:59.743
On the other side
was an address.

24:00.119 --> 24:02.178
Jasmine Gabriel,
Connecticut.

24:02.254 --> 24:07.385
With an instruction,
"Nurse, please mail. "

24:07.826 --> 24:09.817
You figure a prisoner
passed it to her?

24:09.895 --> 24:12.864
Yeah, why the prisoner didn't
use prison mail, I don't know.

24:12.931 --> 24:15.866
Probably because he
didn't have access to it.

24:16.969 --> 24:18.561
One of the unofficial prisoners.

24:18.637 --> 24:22.232
We think Brooklyn Fed is
keeping prisoners off the books.

24:24.109 --> 24:25.633
Why?
We don't know.

24:25.711 --> 24:29.875
Whatever's going on, your girlfriend,
she feels conflicted about it.

24:30.482 --> 24:32.973
She didn't mail the card, but
she didn't throw it away, either.

24:33.051 --> 24:35.042
If she's wrong,
I'm gonna wanna know.

24:35.120 --> 24:37.987
And if she's in trouble,
I gotta help her.

24:38.457 --> 24:39.788
We get it.

24:42.628 --> 24:46.086
So, I figured I've earned my
ride to see AZ's mom, right?

24:53.305 --> 24:55.273
My son? He's fine.

24:55.340 --> 24:58.241
He's at school,
Tufts. Why?

24:58.310 --> 25:00.778
Ma'am, we found a letter
that your son wrote to you.

25:00.846 --> 25:03.542
An employee of a federal prison had it.

25:03.916 --> 25:06.043
So are you sure your son's
been in school all this time?

25:06.118 --> 25:09.884
Well, last summer, he was
hitchhiking to a party in Boston.

25:10.455 --> 25:13.322
He disappeared. Three
months later, he called.

25:13.392 --> 25:18.989
He said he met a girl and he
decided to take time off from school.

25:19.064 --> 25:21.965
Your son's name, AZ,
now that's for Aziz?

25:22.034 --> 25:24.468
Your family
is Lebanese Christian.

25:24.536 --> 25:28.370
<i>Presbyterian since 1984. My
son and daughter were born here.</i>

25:29.775 --> 25:32.437
Mrs. Gabriel,
in the letter,

25:35.414 --> 25:37.848
your son mentioned
an Uncle Harry.

25:41.687 --> 25:46.317
Now, he wrote that he had
Uncle Harry's illness.

25:49.661 --> 25:52.152
What was his illness,
Mrs. Gabriel?

25:55.200 --> 25:57.395
My late husband's uncle,

25:59.338 --> 26:01.363
the Syrians
imprisoned him

26:02.241 --> 26:04.971
for drawing an anti-government cartoon.

26:06.278 --> 26:09.736
He wasn't allowed to see
anyone, not even family.

26:14.786 --> 26:16.879
Eight years they kept him.

26:20.826 --> 26:24.455
I got busted for hitchhiking on the
interstate. I was totally in the wrong.

26:24.529 --> 26:28.226
Hitchhiking doesn't get you
three months in federal prison.

26:29.234 --> 26:32.761
So, did you get accused
of anything else? Anything?

26:33.605 --> 26:35.072
They accuse you
of being a terrorist?

26:35.140 --> 26:39.201
No. I'm fine.
Everything's fine.

26:39.278 --> 26:41.439
Everything's fine, but
you dropped out of Tufts.

26:41.513 --> 26:44.676
I didn't drop out, sir.
I took a leave of absence.

26:44.750 --> 26:47.583
Aziz, come on, man.
What happened to you?

26:48.220 --> 26:49.847
Nothing. When you were in prison,

26:49.922 --> 26:53.653
you passed a note to a nurse.
It didn't read like nothing.

26:53.725 --> 26:56.193
I just wanted to let my mother
know I was okay, feeling great.

26:56.261 --> 26:58.491
Great, like your Uncle Harry?

27:03.635 --> 27:05.967
Here, let me
give you a hand.

27:07.973 --> 27:09.907
You all right? Is something
wrong with your right arm?

27:09.975 --> 27:11.670
No. No.

27:12.644 --> 27:16.011
Look, in prison, do you
remember a guard named Kenna?

27:17.916 --> 27:20.612
Or Plumm,
Unit Counselor Plumm?

27:22.754 --> 27:24.915
I don't remember
any names.

27:26.191 --> 27:28.989
I have to get the fish
back in the tank.

27:30.595 --> 27:31.789
Okay.

27:37.602 --> 27:39.570
His right arm,
it's mostly immobile.

27:39.638 --> 27:43.665
Maybe a radial nerve injury
from being turned the wrong way.

27:44.276 --> 27:45.436
What are you saying?

27:45.510 --> 27:48.445
Maybe Uncle Harry's
illness included torture.

27:49.047 --> 27:50.844
There's also his
body language.

27:50.916 --> 27:53.043
You know, the way he reacted

27:53.118 --> 27:55.814
when I mentioned the guards,
even his choice of work.

27:55.887 --> 27:57.980
He's re-enacting his trauma.

27:58.056 --> 28:00.320
Oh, this sounds like a
lot of guessing to me.

28:00.392 --> 28:02.792
Prisoners are tortured for months
on end, no one says anything,

28:02.861 --> 28:04.351
no one sees anything?

28:04.429 --> 28:06.624
We don't expect you
to be objective.

28:06.698 --> 28:09.895
I know this girl, and
that's all you need to know.

28:10.702 --> 28:13.728
Thanks for the ride.
I'll take the train back.

28:19.144 --> 28:23.581
The floors can get slippery. Next
time, be careful where you step.

28:24.916 --> 28:25.940
I'll get you
a painkiller.

28:26.018 --> 28:27.747
He doesn't need it.

28:40.999 --> 28:44.230
Thank you, Cyrus. Call me
next time you're in town.

28:45.270 --> 28:49.104
Aziz Gabriel was held under a
federal material witness warrant,

28:49.174 --> 28:52.837
until it was determined he had
no relevant testimony to offer.

28:52.911 --> 28:53.900
A witness to what?

28:53.979 --> 28:56.743
My contact at Justice
couldn't tell me,

28:56.815 --> 28:59.750
except to say
it was terrorism-related.

29:00.886 --> 29:02.353
Oh, the great catch-all.

29:02.421 --> 29:06.790
They held this kid, this American
citizen, for three months,

29:06.858 --> 29:08.985
with no charges,
no lawyer.

29:09.061 --> 29:12.462
Didn't we fight a revolution
against this kind of thing?

29:12.531 --> 29:15.898
The other prisoners at Brooklyn
Fed, the unofficial ones.

29:15.967 --> 29:16.956
Same story?

29:17.803 --> 29:19.202
Your guess
is as good as mine.

29:19.271 --> 29:21.865
The Feds aren't required to
release the names of the detainees,

29:21.940 --> 29:25.467
their whereabouts, even the
reason for their detention.

29:25.544 --> 29:28.377
Prisoners without names,
without lawyers.

29:29.481 --> 29:33.178
No wonder the guards see them
as fair game for abuse.

29:34.219 --> 29:38.178
If Kenna was having nightmares
about it, enough to change jobs,

29:38.256 --> 29:41.953
maybe the rest of his crew was worried
he might blow the whistle on them.

29:42.027 --> 29:45.656
If I'm going to present the federal
government with allegations of torture

29:45.730 --> 29:48.858
against prisoners that
don't officially exist,

29:49.334 --> 29:51.325
I want to be bulletproof.

29:51.470 --> 29:52.994
Bring me armor.

29:53.505 --> 29:54.802
Taylor's the one
that got killed.

29:54.873 --> 29:57.307
He didn't do
anything wrong.

29:58.110 --> 30:01.944
Carley, if you're worried about losing
your survivor benefits over this,

30:02.013 --> 30:03.275
we can help.

30:03.348 --> 30:06.340
But anything Taylor
told you, we need to know.

30:08.687 --> 30:10.917
He wasn't comfortable with it.

30:11.256 --> 30:15.989
The smuggling and the phones
and the outside food.

30:16.061 --> 30:17.050
For tip money!

30:18.864 --> 30:20.354
Isn't that what
you wanted to know?

30:20.432 --> 30:23.731
There were other things
about special prisoners.

30:26.771 --> 30:31.299
Two years ago, he said they got these
Arab prisoners in a special wing.

30:32.210 --> 30:35.145
He said that Kurt Plumm,
the unit counselor,

30:35.447 --> 30:38.507
he said he did something
stupid to one of them.

30:41.052 --> 30:42.576
Anything since?

30:43.288 --> 30:44.380
No.

30:44.956 --> 30:49.120
Taylor stopped talking about it,
and then he started not sleeping.

30:49.194 --> 30:51.856
We need proof of what
was going on, Carley.

30:51.930 --> 30:55.229
Maybe you know one of the
crew who might talk to us?

30:56.168 --> 30:59.467
I've gotten no calls from
any of them since Taylor died.

30:59.538 --> 31:02.939
Except that somebody's been
leaving an envelope, once a week,

31:03.008 --> 31:04.771
stuffed under the door.

31:04.843 --> 31:07.812
Fifty bucks.
Taylor's tip money.

31:16.188 --> 31:17.849
How was the train?

31:19.257 --> 31:22.192
I prefer the ferry.
Where you at with this?

31:22.661 --> 31:26.119
Well, the kid was held on a
federal material witness warrant

31:26.198 --> 31:28.393
in a legal no-man's land.

31:28.466 --> 31:31.094
And he had company,
courtesy of the Patriot Act.

31:31.169 --> 31:34.696
Oh, the Patriot Act. Yeah, well, I
read that under its original title.

31:34.773 --> 31:36.001
<i>Nineteen Eighty-Four.</i>

31:37.242 --> 31:41.235
One of Kenna's crew has been
slipping the widow some guilt money.

31:42.747 --> 31:45.875
Somebody's grown a
conscience. I wonder who.

31:50.021 --> 31:52.489
Funny how bad apples
always find each other.

31:52.557 --> 31:55.651
Well, maybe it's the barrels
that make the apples bad.

31:55.727 --> 31:57.092
The Stanford Prison study,

31:57.162 --> 32:00.723
when they divided the students
into prisoners, guards...

32:00.799 --> 32:05.065
Within six days, the guards had the
prisoners stripped down naked, wearing hoods.

32:05.136 --> 32:06.160
Sounds familiar.

32:06.238 --> 32:08.968
Ordinary students
turned into sadists

32:09.841 --> 32:12.867
by giving them power
over other human beings.

32:12.944 --> 32:16.573
This one, Rollie Clay, wife,
two kids, sings in the choir.

32:17.015 --> 32:20.974
Started on the job same day as
Taylor, lives in the same neighborhood.

32:21.052 --> 32:22.485
You figure
they were close?

32:22.554 --> 32:25.523
Well, if he can't bring himself
to stay in touch with the widow,

32:25.590 --> 32:28.150
he's probably not slipping
money under her door.

32:28.226 --> 32:32.162
How about this guy? An
ex-Navy man, Doug Hausman,

32:32.230 --> 32:35.324
brags on his application that
he worked to control his blinking

32:35.400 --> 32:37.561
to stay alert during combat.

32:38.770 --> 32:39.862
Oops!

32:40.205 --> 32:42.673
Combat was four years
in Navy Band.

32:42.741 --> 32:44.538
Doesn't get my vote
as a Good Samaritan.

32:44.609 --> 32:49.205
Well, that leaves Hector De
La Cruz. Criminology major,

32:49.614 --> 32:53.607
started part-time at Brooklyn
Fed, joined Plumm's crew in 2002,

32:53.685 --> 32:55.312
quit school
three months later.

32:55.387 --> 32:59.414
Two months ago, he changed the
beneficiary on his life insurance.

33:00.292 --> 33:02.055
He named his church.

33:03.962 --> 33:06.396
I see long hours
in the confessional.

33:09.801 --> 33:12.133
I don't have fifty bucks
to give to anybody.

33:12.203 --> 33:13.864
I got a student
loan to pay off.

33:13.938 --> 33:15.997
Come on, kid, I think you
know what happened to Kenna

33:16.074 --> 33:17.371
and I think
you know why.

33:17.442 --> 33:20.502
He was mugged for his
wallet. That's what I know.

33:20.578 --> 33:24.173
The prison said that today is
your day off. Where you going?

33:24.249 --> 33:25.238
I go dancing.

33:25.317 --> 33:26.545
In your boots?

33:26.618 --> 33:28.711
What do you mean? You got
all these fancy shoes here.

33:28.787 --> 33:32.120
You put your watch in here,
even your Jesus-on-a-chain.

33:32.190 --> 33:33.782
All your personal jewelry.

33:33.858 --> 33:37.919
Come on, Hector. You're going to
work on your day off, aren't you?

33:37.996 --> 33:41.432
Yeah, Rollie... Rollie got an
emergency with one of his kids,

33:41.499 --> 33:45.128
he's running a couple of hours
late. I'm just filling in.

33:46.371 --> 33:48.202
Now I gotta go, okay?

33:49.674 --> 33:52.268
We checked. Rollie Clay
showed up for work on time.

33:52.344 --> 33:55.370
Sounds like the crew's
going to battle stations.

33:55.447 --> 33:58.746
I couldn't get through to Gina,
but I talked to her mother.

33:58.817 --> 34:01.513
Gina told her she's having
to stay late at work.

34:01.586 --> 34:04.419
Well, if the guards
are closing ranks,

34:04.489 --> 34:06.389
they know that
she can sink them.

34:06.658 --> 34:08.216
Look, we gotta get
her out of there.

34:08.293 --> 34:09.521
First you gotta
get in the prison.

34:09.594 --> 34:12.290
Well, what might get us in the
door is a material witness warrant.

34:12.364 --> 34:15.822
For Nurse Lowe? I like your
sense of irony, Detective.

34:16.333 --> 34:17.494
Consider it done.

34:17.569 --> 34:20.833
And maybe we can do something
about the unofficial prisoners.

34:20.905 --> 34:24.272
Let me have your weapons,
phones. You know the drill.

34:25.543 --> 34:29.172
I guess if we need one, we can
always borrow from an inmate.

34:30.581 --> 34:32.572
You expect me to issue
writs of habeas corpus

34:32.650 --> 34:34.139
for unnamed prisoners?

34:34.219 --> 34:35.379
I've never heard
of such a thing.

34:35.453 --> 34:38.047
The writ is meant to protect
the innocent, Your Honor.

34:38.123 --> 34:42.389
If we can issue John Doe indictments
to arrest unknown suspects,

34:42.460 --> 34:45.088
why not issue writs to
protect the unknown innocent?

34:45.163 --> 34:46.891
But these are
federal prisoners.

34:46.965 --> 34:50.161
Being abused by citizens
of the State of New York.

34:50.935 --> 34:54.302
Our responsibility is the
most immediate, Your Honor.

34:59.077 --> 35:01.568
I don't want your
protection, Mike.

35:02.046 --> 35:03.206
You two don't
belong here.

35:03.281 --> 35:05.545
Gina, you can give me an argument
when we're out. We're leaving.

35:05.617 --> 35:08.745
I can't leave. They're
bringing in a sick prisoner.

35:08.820 --> 35:10.378
Who? Kurt and the gang?

35:12.524 --> 35:14.116
That sounds like lockdown.

35:14.192 --> 35:17.059
Double deuce. Something's
really gone wrong.

35:17.128 --> 35:19.255
We're out of here.
Let's go.

35:19.664 --> 35:23.532
We have a writ signed by a
judge. You must let us in.

35:23.601 --> 35:28.061
I said the facility is in lockdown,
sir. Nobody in, nobody out.

35:29.874 --> 35:31.136
Just straight
this way?

35:31.209 --> 35:34.201
Yeah. Through these
gates to the staging area.

35:35.947 --> 35:36.936
Locked out.

35:37.015 --> 35:38.539
Gina, where you going?

35:38.616 --> 35:40.584
We're in lockdown. And
what are they doing here?

35:40.652 --> 35:42.745
She's in custody.
She's under our protection.

35:42.821 --> 35:44.789
She's leaving with us. No.
You're not leaving, Gina.

35:44.856 --> 35:47.086
We got an inmate that
needs medical attention.

35:47.158 --> 35:49.023
He's spitting
up blood, Gina.

35:49.093 --> 35:50.583
Well, we'II...

35:53.565 --> 35:55.226
We'll go with her.

35:56.201 --> 35:59.398
I'm sorry, Detectives, you're not
authorized to be in the galleries.

35:59.471 --> 36:01.701
Gina, this guy
might be dying.

36:03.675 --> 36:05.506
There's no sick prisoner.

36:05.577 --> 36:06.908
There's no sick prisoner,
is there, Kurt?

36:06.978 --> 36:09.970
What kind of party have
you got planned for her?

36:10.048 --> 36:13.313
Your buddies, the wise guys, are
they going to take care of her?

36:13.384 --> 36:14.578
Like they took
care of Kenna?

36:14.652 --> 36:17.519
You know, for being so far away
from the free world, Detectives,

36:17.589 --> 36:19.352
you're awful mouthy.

36:20.158 --> 36:23.355
You know that people get
caught out during lockdown,

36:23.428 --> 36:27.364
they get lost, they go through
a door that didn't lock,

36:28.299 --> 36:31.029
and then like that,
they're in with the animals.

36:31.102 --> 36:32.899
They get eaten alive.

36:36.207 --> 36:39.176
Okay, okay. We understand
what you're saying,

36:40.278 --> 36:43.873
but I guarantee that we're
gonna take one of you with us.

36:44.916 --> 36:46.975
And the ones we don't,

36:47.051 --> 36:50.418
well, that's what the death
penalty's for, gentlemen.

36:54.459 --> 36:58.088
Gina, tell us
what you saw.

37:00.498 --> 37:03.092
Tell us what you saw this
animal do to those prisoners.

37:03.167 --> 37:05.067
Go on, Gina, tell him.

37:05.837 --> 37:11.104
I saw prisoners with symptoms of
malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies

37:11.175 --> 37:13.075
from being denied food.

37:13.745 --> 37:16.839
Those people were always
going on hunger strikes.

37:16.915 --> 37:18.041
What else, Gina?

37:18.116 --> 37:21.210
They were suffering
from exposure to cold.

37:22.153 --> 37:26.317
They said their clothing and blankets
had been taken away from them.

37:27.258 --> 37:29.726
They had untreated
cuts and burns,

37:30.495 --> 37:33.487
injuries to their feet,
dislocated shoulders.

37:34.432 --> 37:37.230
One of them was bleeding
from his rectum.

37:37.302 --> 37:40.533
He said he'd been penetrated with
a pencil during a cavity search.

37:40.605 --> 37:41.902
A pencil?

37:43.575 --> 37:45.668
Now, how does someone
get to the point

37:45.743 --> 37:48.507
where they do that
to another person?

37:50.949 --> 37:52.382
Huh? Hector?

37:53.651 --> 37:56.347
You got a major
in Criminology, right?

37:57.155 --> 37:58.179
You know all about this stuff.

37:58.256 --> 38:00.781
You don't talk
to me, man.

38:00.858 --> 38:04.157
The pathology of power, you know, you
give power to a person over others,

38:04.228 --> 38:06.355
they become addicted to it.

38:08.766 --> 38:11.792
They like people doing
what they tell them,

38:11.869 --> 38:14.838
and they don't like people
who have no power,

38:16.307 --> 38:17.865
like prisoners.

38:18.576 --> 38:21.010
No, I don't
remember that stuff.

38:21.079 --> 38:23.809
You don't remember
yourself in college?

38:24.716 --> 38:26.877
Studying the nature of evil?

38:28.820 --> 38:30.845
You forget about that guy?

38:38.863 --> 38:41.957
You remember him now?
Come on, man.

38:47.639 --> 38:50.938
Oh, man, what the hell?

38:54.912 --> 38:56.709
Yeah, what the hell.

38:57.115 --> 38:58.844
Get a grip, Hector!

39:01.386 --> 39:03.320
How about you, Rollie?

39:04.622 --> 39:05.611
You were close to Kenna.

39:05.690 --> 39:07.123
All right,
let's shut these guys up.

39:07.191 --> 39:09.591
Close to him
and his wife, right?

39:11.396 --> 39:14.661
His wife said that you
haven't called since Kurt...

39:14.932 --> 39:16.957
Since Kurt had him killed.

39:20.538 --> 39:23.302
Why is that? Is that
because you feel remorse?

39:23.374 --> 39:26.605
Because you're still a
good man? Still a good man.

39:26.944 --> 39:28.571
Rollie, let's go.

39:29.714 --> 39:32.911
Look what he's turned you guys
into, a bunch of errand boys

39:32.984 --> 39:35.919
for wise guys, who are
getting fat and happy,

39:35.987 --> 39:38.251
while you guys are starving
and beating prisoners

39:38.322 --> 39:41.223
that haven't even been
charged with a crime.

39:41.959 --> 39:43.620
For what, Rollie?

39:47.865 --> 39:50.095
I've read your
personnel file.

39:51.969 --> 39:54.267
You belong
to your church choir.

39:54.338 --> 39:56.238
What do you sing about?

39:58.309 --> 40:00.573
It's about forgiveness,
repentance.

40:03.948 --> 40:07.406
What are you waiting for?
This is our prison.

40:09.053 --> 40:12.250
Kurt, they're cops. Cops.

40:14.659 --> 40:16.217
I'm not down for this.

40:16.327 --> 40:18.056
Pick that up.
Pick it up.

40:18.129 --> 40:19.494
They're gonna
put you in prison

40:19.564 --> 40:21.930
and you know what the
animals are gonna do to us.

40:21.999 --> 40:24.126
I'll do my time
in solitary.

40:27.638 --> 40:29.629
But I'm not killing cops.

40:36.547 --> 40:39.778
Come on, man. What, man?
You were in the Navy.

40:41.819 --> 40:42.877
Why?

40:43.855 --> 40:48.087
You wanted to be brave, you wanted
to serve for your country, right?

40:48.459 --> 40:50.859
How did this guy sell it to
you? Some kind of payback?

40:50.928 --> 40:54.056
Or patriotic duty?
Is that what it was?

40:54.132 --> 40:56.066
We were meting out justice.
Doug knows that.

40:56.134 --> 40:58.068
He knows what
real bravery is!

40:58.136 --> 41:00.832
He was in the service.
He saw it there.

41:02.540 --> 41:04.132
We saw it there.

41:12.717 --> 41:14.844
You do the brave thing now.

41:16.654 --> 41:17.848
Unlock that gate.

41:17.922 --> 41:20.152
Doug, you do that,
we're done.

41:42.246 --> 41:43.235
I'll walk you out.

41:43.314 --> 41:44.941
Good man, good man.

42:07.004 --> 42:08.198
Logan.

42:09.941 --> 42:12.034
Come on,
we're all leaving.

42:37.902 --> 42:39.631
I'll ride with her.

42:47.778 --> 42:49.040
That guy?

42:50.381 --> 42:53.942
He would've been worth another
10 years of Staten Island.

43:01.425 --> 43:03.859
I'll see you when we file reports.

43:09.200 --> 43:12.829
Our own citizens,
on our very own soil.

43:14.205 --> 43:17.538
At least sooner or later,
everybody gets their day in court.
