Dude, I really need to Zen out.

00:02.907 --> 00:05.041
A bird flew into my mouth this morning.

00:05.142 --> 00:07.110
- Eww, again?
- I don't know what's going on.

00:07.211 --> 00:12.148
Well, what could be more Zen than
yoga that's suggested donation... Free.

00:12.250 --> 00:14.050
You catch that, suggested donation.

00:14.151 --> 00:16.318
Free.

00:16.749 --> 00:19.623
Ooh, so it really smells in here.

00:19.724 --> 00:22.292
Okay, this isn't "Real
Housewives" yoga, NeNe.

00:22.393 --> 00:25.896
Sure, it has a few flaws,
but that's the price you pay.

00:25.997 --> 00:27.497
You catch that, that's
the price you pay.

00:27.598 --> 00:29.299
No, I... I get it.

Two of us to get in here.

00:36.810 --> 00:38.938
Doesn't seem like enough space for us...

00:38.976 --> 00:40.196
- It's plenty.
- Is it?

00:40.334 --> 00:41.901
Yep, now it is.

I just have... y'know, sometimes
I feel like he broke up with me too.

03:20.104 --> 03:21.204
God, are you flexing?

03:21.305 --> 03:22.706
- No.
- Can you?

03:22.807 --> 03:25.208
- Okay.

Okay.

Uh, Abbi?

03:33.685 --> 03:35.953
- Do we live in a zoo?
- Uh, what now?

03:36.054 --> 03:39.556
Because I'm pretty sure
there's an elephant in the room.

03:39.657 --> 03:41.558
You're using my suitcase.

Uh, this is not even close

03:43.294 --> 03:44.962
to being your suitcase, this is mine.

03:45.063 --> 03:48.778
Drew Barrymore wrote an entire
article about this suitcase.

03:48.813 --> 03:50.167
I splurged on this.

03:50.268 --> 03:52.111
I thought Melodie
bought me that suitcase.

03:52.146 --> 03:53.841
- I use it so much.
- You do?

03:53.876 --> 03:55.105
Just once.

03:55.206 --> 03:57.174
- Okay.
- Anyhoos.

03:57.209 --> 03:58.844
What's the hot goss with you and Trey?

03:58.879 --> 04:01.645
You guys are so Vivian

04:01.746 --> 04:03.563
Okay, there's no hot goss.

04:03.598 --> 04:05.124
Like, it kind of ended badly.

04:05.159 --> 04:08.769
He's actually been switching his
shifts at the gym to avoid me.

04:08.804 --> 04:10.354
You want me to try to talk to him?

04:10.655 --> 04:11.888
I have a way with words.

04:11.989 --> 04:15.525
No, thank you, Bevers, but I'm
just gonna keep packing, please.

Well, if you're not
gonna say it, I will.

04:20.298 --> 04:23.400

04:35.146 --> 04:36.813

04:38.416 --> 04:39.583
- Thank you so much for everything.
- Yeah.

Have fun, and please leave the radio on

04:41.686 --> 04:43.053
when you're gone for Rat
Bastard and her family.

04:43.154 --> 04:44.588
- We can afford it.
- Yeah, of course.

05:04.108 --> 05:05.509

- Ilana!
- Yes.

06:07.438 --> 06:09.339
Dude, I can't believe
we're actually doing this.

06:09.440 --> 06:10.907
Yes, we're going to...

06:17.348 --> 06:20.016
You know, sometimes the flight
is actually my favorite part.

06:20.118 --> 06:22.719
Hit up Hudson News, get
some adult magazines.

06:22.820 --> 06:25.422
Looking at boobs is the best
way to relax during turbulence.

06:25.523 --> 06:26.990
It's nature's Xanax.

06:27.091 --> 06:28.625
You know, sometimes
if I forget the mags,

06:28.726 --> 06:31.762
- I look down at my own.
- What?

06:31.863 --> 06:33.497
Isn't that the whole
thing with adult magazines?

06:33.598 --> 06:34.998
Oh, I...

06:35.099 --> 06:36.633
Okay, I was talking
about adult magazines

06:36.734 --> 06:39.970
like "Real Simple" or "O" or "Dwell."

06:40.071 --> 06:42.939
I was talking about
that, too. (baby crying)

06:43.040 --> 06:44.608

06:44.709 --> 06:47.778

06:53.351 --> 06:54.618

06:54.719 --> 06:55.952

06:56.053 --> 06:57.087
<i>threw herself on the tracks.</i>

06:57.188 --> 06:58.355

06:58.456 --> 06:59.823
Jesus, use a bridge.

06:59.924 --> 07:01.725
Selfish.

07:01.826 --> 07:03.093
It's okay. You know what?

07:03.194 --> 07:04.494
I padded the travel time.

07:04.595 --> 07:06.430
We are all good, we're all good.

07:06.531 --> 07:08.265
It's not like we left
our passports or anything.

07:11.536 --> 07:15.071
Oh, my God... oh, my God!

07:18.075 --> 07:20.410
I left my passport.

07:20.511 --> 07:22.112
(baby crying)

07:22.653 --> 07:24.687
Okay, it's been 20 minutes.

07:24.788 --> 07:27.840
How long does it take to move
a (bleep) body off the tracks?

07:28.641 --> 07:29.525
I'm sorry.

07:29.626 --> 07:30.926
Dude, I (bleep) hate myself.

07:31.027 --> 07:32.795
I am so sorry I left my passport.

07:32.896 --> 07:35.831
I'm a (bleep) baby grown-up.

07:35.932 --> 07:36.832
Do you have any tape?

07:36.933 --> 07:38.467
Do I have any tape?

07:40.203 --> 07:42.037
Yeah, I have tape.

07:44.074 --> 07:45.841
A bunch of different kinds.

07:45.942 --> 07:47.309
Really cute.

07:47.410 --> 07:48.811
Jesus, it stinks.

07:48.912 --> 07:50.146
Bologna?

07:50.247 --> 07:52.848
Ugh, it's unbelievable, right?

07:52.949 --> 07:54.884
It is unbelievable.

07:54.985 --> 07:56.285
So salty.

07:58.155 --> 08:00.456
Okay, so we're gonna
get off at the next stop,

08:00.557 --> 08:02.925
Uber to your apartment, and
then book it to the airport.

08:03.026 --> 08:04.426
Great, yes, all is good.

08:04.528 --> 08:05.694
All is not good!

08:05.795 --> 08:07.781
It's like 9/11 all over again.

08:07.816 --> 08:09.398
It's 9/112!

08:09.499 --> 08:11.300
Return of the 9/11s!

08:11.401 --> 08:13.369
Oh! Oh, my God!

08:13.470 --> 08:15.604
Okay, so if we don't move
in the next 30 minutes,

08:15.705 --> 08:17.439
we have to have some
sort of escape plan.

08:17.541 --> 08:19.308
You know, I once saw
this documentary on Vimeo

08:19.409 --> 08:22.011
about these mole people
who live down in the subway.

08:22.112 --> 08:23.512
I bet that they would help us.

08:23.613 --> 08:25.681
We would probably just
have to give them our shoes

08:25.782 --> 08:27.516
and cut off a little
bit of our hair, but...

08:27.617 --> 08:29.151
we'll get new shoes.

08:29.252 --> 08:32.221
Truly impressed with you at every turn.

08:32.322 --> 08:33.621
It's been 25 minutes!

08:33.722 --> 08:34.789
And counting.

08:34.890 --> 08:35.924
(shrieking)

08:36.025 --> 08:38.159
- Okay, I have a fun game.
- Okay.

08:38.260 --> 08:41.230
Let's say we were stuck
in a subway forever,

08:41.331 --> 08:43.265
which is obviously not gonna happen.

08:43.366 --> 08:44.700
- Okay.
- Who would we (bleep)?

08:44.801 --> 08:47.570
Who would we marry? Who would we eat?

08:47.671 --> 08:49.271
All right, I can do that,

08:49.372 --> 08:51.373
'cause I feel like I know
a bunch of the answers.

08:51.474 --> 08:54.777
Dude. Def (bleep) him, "Mad Men" style.

08:54.878 --> 08:57.646
Some real standard
narrative bull (bleep).

08:57.747 --> 09:01.116
Crusty old dude, hot young girl,

09:01.218 --> 09:04.653
and then I'd Abbi-Jeremy
him to even it out.

09:04.754 --> 09:06.589
Peg.

09:06.690 --> 09:07.890
Okay.

09:07.991 --> 09:09.725
Marriage material right there, you know?

09:09.826 --> 09:11.260
- Yeah.
- New Yorker.

09:11.361 --> 09:13.495
Bet she could teach me
a thing or two, like,

09:13.597 --> 09:15.564
how to finish an article
in the New Yorker.

09:15.665 --> 09:17.499
I think I would marry her.

09:17.601 --> 09:18.801
Wiccan wedding.

09:18.902 --> 09:20.469
First dance to Wicked Wisdom.

09:20.570 --> 09:22.671
Fist! (chuckling)

09:22.772 --> 09:25.741
Uhh, you know...

09:25.842 --> 09:27.610
Okay, I would eat that baby.

09:27.711 --> 09:29.245
- Is that terrible of me?
- No.

09:29.346 --> 09:30.913
- I just would.
- No, it makes perfect sense.

09:31.014 --> 09:32.448
She looks delicious.

09:32.549 --> 09:34.116
You would probably be sparing her a life

09:34.217 --> 09:36.585
of tragedy and terror,
living down in the subway.

09:36.686 --> 09:38.954
Plus, I feel like babies are, like,

09:39.055 --> 09:40.893
the most delicious in
terms of actual meat.

09:40.928 --> 09:43.325
- Desperate times.
- Calling for desperate measures.

09:43.426 --> 09:46.595
And who are we to judge
our post-apocalyptic selves?

09:46.696 --> 09:47.930
What part would you eat first?

09:48.031 --> 09:49.298
Which part is the most tender?

09:49.399 --> 09:51.166
Probably like, the side or the butt.

09:51.268 --> 09:53.836
Dude, let me try something.

09:53.937 --> 09:55.271
Stand up.

09:55.372 --> 09:56.872
Okay.

10:01.378 --> 10:03.445
Dear God.

10:03.546 --> 10:04.780
Please make this subway move.

10:04.881 --> 10:06.315
Ilana, that's not how it works.

10:06.416 --> 10:08.450
You can't just rub my
butt, and the train...

10:08.551 --> 10:11.086
(rumbling)

10:11.187 --> 10:13.389
Ow!

10:13.490 --> 10:17.760
Did it again, the power
of the butt, bitch.

10:17.861 --> 10:20.729
I'm really happy we didn't
have to eat the baby.

10:20.830 --> 10:23.232
Yeah. Happy.

10:30.807 --> 10:32.195
Where are we, dude?

10:32.196 --> 10:34.298
It says we're on Sutphin
Boulevard in Queens.

10:34.333 --> 10:35.744
Jesus Christ!

10:35.845 --> 10:37.746
Uber surge fare is 12.5.

10:37.847 --> 10:39.715
They really reel you in,

10:39.816 --> 10:41.684
and then they wring you (bleep) dry

10:41.785 --> 10:43.886
with their grubby little
paws right around your neck.

10:43.987 --> 10:45.821
Then they make you type
in the surge fare again,

10:45.922 --> 10:47.923
it's like, I know... I know what it is.

10:48.024 --> 10:50.292
- It is so rude.
- God.

10:50.393 --> 10:53.095
The ride estimator says it
would be approximately...

10:53.196 --> 10:54.797
(chuckling)

10:54.898 --> 10:58.567
$1,200 from here to Gowanus back to JFK.

10:58.668 --> 11:00.436
I hate them. I love
them, but I hate them.

11:00.537 --> 11:03.222
- Oh, my God. This is a sign.
- Okay.

11:03.223 --> 11:04.700
- Yeah.
- We hotwire that cab,

11:04.708 --> 11:07.042
drive ourselves within
walking distance to JFK,

11:07.144 --> 11:10.246
soak it in gasoline, and torch it
so they can't trace it... Let's go.

11:10.347 --> 11:12.047
I was gonna say maybe we could just

11:12.149 --> 11:14.066
knock on the door and see
if they could drive us.

11:14.101 --> 11:14.950
Oh, let's try that first.

11:15.051 --> 11:16.318
Okay.

11:22.626 --> 11:24.160
Okay.

11:27.664 --> 11:29.198
- Hello.
- Hello, sir.

11:29.299 --> 11:31.867
I know that this is ridiculous,

11:31.968 --> 11:36.038
but we would like to hire
you to drive us in your taxi.

11:36.139 --> 11:37.973
To a few destinations.

11:39.476 --> 11:41.076
I couldn't be more off-duty.

11:41.178 --> 11:43.412
Work is the worst, right?
I get that, but listen,

11:43.513 --> 11:45.648
we would not be asking if
it was not an emergency.

11:45.749 --> 11:48.150
Please, we're over on our way
to a really important trip,

11:48.251 --> 11:50.152
and I'm such a moron,

11:50.253 --> 11:52.354
I forgot my passport, so, I'm in trouble

11:52.455 --> 11:54.490
with the wife, you can understand.

11:54.591 --> 11:56.792
And we can't find any cabs out
here in the middle of nowhere.

11:56.893 --> 11:58.635
This beautiful neighborhood,
it's gorgeous out here.

11:58.670 --> 12:01.190
- Quaint.
- Lovely, I might look at some...

12:01.198 --> 12:02.767
- So sweet.
- To buy or some...

12:02.768 --> 12:05.116
- I don't know, rent, whatever.
- Plus, there are good schools around here.

12:05.151 --> 12:06.402
We are begging you.

12:06.503 --> 12:08.037
We just need to get her passport

12:08.138 --> 12:09.405
and then get to JFK, or
we're gonna miss our flight

12:09.506 --> 12:11.708
and the trip of a lifetime. Please.

12:11.743 --> 12:13.609
How about...

12:13.710 --> 12:17.613
A crisp $100 bill from my bra?

12:22.185 --> 12:23.786
Okay.

12:23.995 --> 12:25.652
All right, I guess we'll just...

12:27.257 --> 12:28.857
Let's roll.

12:32.996 --> 12:34.763
(tires screeching)

12:34.864 --> 12:36.398
"Fast and Furious" over here.

12:36.499 --> 12:37.666
How old are you?

12:37.767 --> 12:39.535
15.

12:51.982 --> 12:54.283
Okay, we're coming
around the corner in five,

12:54.384 --> 12:56.118
four, three...

12:56.219 --> 12:58.320
(honking) Hold on.
An old lady is pushing

12:58.421 --> 13:00.638
a baby stroller full of
empty cans across the street.

13:00.673 --> 13:01.824
Waiting.

13:01.925 --> 13:04.193
She's almost across.

13:04.294 --> 13:06.095
Okay, now we're coming
around the corner.

13:06.196 --> 13:08.097
Can you see my arm? I'm in the cab.

13:08.198 --> 13:09.265
Do you see me? I see you.

13:09.366 --> 13:10.733
Okay, Anhur, slow down,

13:10.834 --> 13:12.568
- but don't stop.
- I gotcha, girl.

13:12.823 --> 13:14.056
- Hey!
- Hi, honey.

13:14.189 --> 13:15.379
- Here's your passport, bye!
- Thank you.

13:15.565 --> 13:17.606
- Yes! To the airport!
- Love you, Himmelz!

13:17.707 --> 13:19.541
Bye-bye, baby!

13:19.643 --> 13:20.843
Ooh, whoops!

13:20.944 --> 13:22.645
Oh, my brakes! Ay, my brakes!

13:22.746 --> 13:24.546
Ay! Hold me closer, closer, closer.

13:24.648 --> 13:26.248
Yes, ay!

13:28.158 --> 13:29.658
(brakes screeching)

13:33.096 --> 13:34.630
- Thank you.
- Wait, wait, so...

13:34.731 --> 13:36.198
You only get so many
important moments in your life,

13:36.299 --> 13:37.900
and you have to grasp them.

13:38.001 --> 13:38.968
Will you go to prom with me?

13:39.069 --> 13:40.369
Both of you? Or one of you?

13:40.470 --> 13:41.771
I don't care... I think I love you both.

13:41.872 --> 13:43.305
Can you be in love with two people?

13:43.407 --> 13:44.940
Yes, you definitely can.

13:45.041 --> 13:46.542
That is one of the most
dangerous misconceptions

13:46.643 --> 13:48.444
about monogamy, but we can't go with you

13:48.545 --> 13:49.945
because you're a literal child.

13:50.046 --> 13:51.647
We're extremely flattered, though.

13:51.748 --> 13:53.162
You clearly have amazing taste.

13:53.197 --> 13:55.184
Yeah, and don't worry,
you're gonna have sex one day.

13:55.285 --> 13:57.319
I've had sex.

13:57.421 --> 13:59.355
Look at all my (bleep) bracelets.

13:59.456 --> 14:01.424
What the (bleep) are (bleep) bracelets?

14:01.525 --> 14:03.058
Kids are terrifying.

14:04.428 --> 14:05.561
- Sorry.
- So sorry.

14:05.662 --> 14:07.229
- This is ridiculous.
- I'm so sorry.

14:07.330 --> 14:09.765
We just have to cut 'cause
we forgot our passport!

14:09.866 --> 14:11.600
You know, you can understand.

14:11.701 --> 14:14.403
I'm so sorry, we just
gotta slip right past.

14:14.504 --> 14:15.671
Right, right past.

14:15.772 --> 14:18.007
- I'm so sorry, I didn't mean that.
- Sorry, thank you so much.

14:18.108 --> 14:19.473
So sorry.

14:20.210 --> 14:22.144
Hey, do you mind if we cut?
We're late for a flight.

14:22.245 --> 14:23.921
- Oh, yeah, go ahead.
- Thank you so much.

14:28.552 --> 14:30.152
Okay.

14:30.253 --> 14:32.254
Oh, dude, Ilana, (bleep), dude.

14:32.355 --> 14:33.422
Your period stain.

14:33.523 --> 14:36.192
No, dude, it's an old stain.

14:36.293 --> 14:38.828
It's a red herring, 'cause it's
red and looks like a fish, kinda.

14:38.929 --> 14:40.996
I'm packing. I'm packing heat.

14:41.097 --> 14:42.965
I have weed in my vaginé.

14:43.066 --> 14:44.500
Period pants are the ultimate decoy!

14:44.601 --> 14:46.877
If we get caught at the
airport, we're gonna...

14:50.207 --> 14:51.240
Whoa!

14:51.341 --> 14:53.576
This dog is sexually harassing me!

14:53.677 --> 14:54.643
I am so sorry.

14:54.744 --> 14:56.027
Popcorn, get away from her!

14:56.062 --> 14:57.680
Oh!

14:57.781 --> 14:59.782
Oh, my God.

14:59.883 --> 15:01.083
(beep)

15:02.853 --> 15:04.019
(beep)

15:04.120 --> 15:05.855
God! My period pants worked!

15:05.956 --> 15:10.059
Dude, we should Shark Tank
period pants, for real!

15:11.127 --> 15:12.928
Okay. Let's roll.

15:15.499 --> 15:16.626
What the (bleep)!

15:16.661 --> 15:17.700
Leave it! I'll leave mine!

15:17.801 --> 15:19.301
No, dude, it's our whole luggage!

15:19.402 --> 15:20.903
- There, look!
- Hey!

15:21.004 --> 15:22.371
Not today, put it down!

15:22.472 --> 15:23.372
Oh, I was just trying to
take it to the lost and...

15:23.473 --> 15:24.440
Yeah, sure you were!

15:24.541 --> 15:26.775
- Sure!
- (bleep)!

15:33.683 --> 15:35.651
Sorry!

15:37.854 --> 15:38.889
I'm gonna throw up.

15:38.890 --> 15:40.564
Coming through! Coming through!

15:45.462 --> 15:46.962
What a sexy stare you have.

15:47.063 --> 15:48.497
It's scary, too.

15:49.833 --> 15:50.799
Yes!

15:52.736 --> 15:54.403
Wait! We're... We're going to...

15:54.504 --> 15:56.572
Gate's changed. That
flight's back in B-12 now.

15:56.673 --> 15:58.674
Come (bleep) (bleep) on!

16:01.344 --> 16:03.546
Hey, how's it going. Nice shirt.

16:03.647 --> 16:05.147
Come on, come on!

16:05.248 --> 16:06.982
(hissing)

16:10.787 --> 16:12.922
You should have taken the walkway.

16:14.658 --> 16:15.858
So stubborn.

16:20.363 --> 16:23.132
Hey, you grabbed our boards, bro!

16:26.670 --> 16:28.904
Ilana!

16:29.005 --> 16:30.472
I got an extra ticket, let's do this!

16:30.574 --> 16:31.674
Do what, Dale?

16:31.775 --> 16:33.208
What the (bleep) is wrong with you?

16:42.519 --> 16:44.053
Oh! Sorry!

16:44.154 --> 16:47.089
- You (bleep) bitch!
- I didn't mean to hit you.

16:47.190 --> 16:48.357
We are... We're on this flight.

16:48.458 --> 16:49.858
It hasn't left yet. Please.

16:49.960 --> 16:51.393
I was just trying to
get one foot in the door.

16:51.494 --> 16:52.761
It's a shoe, not a foot,

16:52.862 --> 16:54.496
and it hit me, not a door.

16:54.598 --> 16:56.198
The plane is still there,
we can still make it,

16:56.299 --> 16:57.633
- please, please, just let us on.
- We're so close.

16:57.734 --> 16:59.171
You know what? Just,
just go ahead, yeah.

16:59.369 --> 17:00.869
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much.

17:01.044 --> 17:03.038
Thank you so, so much.

17:03.139 --> 17:04.306
We really appreciate it.

17:04.406 --> 17:05.941
We all hate her.

17:06.041 --> 17:07.009
Thank you.

17:07.109 --> 17:09.845
You are two lucky Jews.

17:09.945 --> 17:11.946
We think so, too.

17:12.048 --> 17:14.083
- Yes, we did it!
- Yes, we did it!

17:14.184 --> 17:15.984
Get on the (bleep) plane!

17:15.986 --> 17:17.315
- Sorry.
- Go.

17:19.089 --> 17:21.490
Oh, my God, we (bleep) made it!

17:24.236 --> 17:25.670
Oh, God, I cannot believe we made it.

17:25.771 --> 17:27.605
This is the longest
ramp I've ever been on.

17:27.705 --> 17:30.141
I am so sorry, ladies.

17:30.242 --> 17:32.477
There is no more space in
the overhead compartments,

17:32.578 --> 17:33.911
we'll have to check your luggage.

17:34.012 --> 17:36.180
Actually, yours will probably be okay.

17:36.281 --> 17:38.216
So sleek and streamlined.

17:38.317 --> 17:40.751
Lincoln... had really
adult taste in luggage.

17:40.853 --> 17:42.553
This is actually a
really special bag, too.

17:42.654 --> 17:44.589
- It's Drew's.
- Sorry, this is not your bag?

17:44.690 --> 17:46.224
No, no, no, it's mine... I packed it.

17:46.325 --> 17:48.726
It's just that Ms. Drew Barrymore

17:48.827 --> 17:50.995
highly recommends this bag.

17:51.096 --> 17:53.231
If you Google, in quotes, "Refinery 29,"

17:53.332 --> 17:54.999
in quotes, "Drew Barrymore."

17:55.100 --> 17:56.167
That's amazing.

17:56.268 --> 17:57.902
Unfortunately, Drew Barrymore is

17:58.003 --> 18:00.315
the only person who could
carry on something that bulky.

18:00.350 --> 18:01.973
This is gonna have
to go under the plane.

18:02.074 --> 18:03.841
Okay, hold on. This bag is the bomb.

18:03.942 --> 18:05.710
Please just let me...
I'm sure there's a spot.

18:05.811 --> 18:08.112
Okay, I'm gonna shut these doors

18:08.213 --> 18:09.580
and take off.

18:09.681 --> 18:11.449
Would you like to come with us?

18:11.550 --> 18:14.018
Mark, can you come get this bag, please?

18:14.119 --> 18:16.521
- I'll take your ticket.
- Thanks.

18:16.622 --> 18:18.055
Do you think it's gonna be okay?

18:18.156 --> 18:19.891
I'm sure your bag is in really...

18:21.793 --> 18:24.228
good hands.

18:24.329 --> 18:26.130
Thanks so much.

18:26.231 --> 18:29.433
Whoa! Nice!

18:29.535 --> 18:31.802
International travel is amazing.

18:31.904 --> 18:33.070
No, this is first class.

18:33.171 --> 18:34.305
We gotta keep going.

18:34.406 --> 18:37.208
Ms. Fessiwig, champagne or orange juice?

18:37.309 --> 18:38.543
Orange juice it is.

18:38.644 --> 18:39.911
Oh, my God.

18:40.012 --> 18:42.713
I know, who chooses
juice over champagne?

18:42.814 --> 18:44.315
Ew, coach.

18:44.416 --> 18:45.716
Hello. Um...

18:45.948 --> 18:46.918
Ilana.

18:47.019 --> 18:48.219
- Hi.
- And...

18:48.435 --> 18:49.787
- Abbi.
- Yes.

18:49.888 --> 18:52.223
I'm Jared. Welcome to Birthmarc.

18:52.324 --> 18:53.758
Surf's up.

18:55.093 --> 18:56.460
Oh, cool.

18:56.562 --> 18:58.563
For the next ten days,
we will be traveling

18:58.664 --> 19:01.532
around the holiest place
in the world, Israel.

19:01.633 --> 19:02.700
For free!

19:02.801 --> 19:05.469
- Gotcha, Jews.
- Makes no sense.

19:05.571 --> 19:07.805
Well, our beautiful country
will teach you all about

19:07.906 --> 19:09.640
Judaism, its rich history,

19:09.741 --> 19:11.409
and I'm looking at the two of you,

19:11.510 --> 19:13.144
its reproductive future.

19:14.780 --> 19:15.913
We're almost home.

19:16.014 --> 19:18.549
- I see.
- Cool.

19:18.650 --> 19:21.552
Jews! Jews! Jews! Jews!

19:21.653 --> 19:24.055
Jews! Jews! Jews! Jews!

19:24.156 --> 19:26.857
Jews! Jews! Jews! Jews!

19:26.959 --> 19:29.126
Jews! Jews! Jews! Jews!

19:29.227 --> 19:30.828
Jews! Jews! Jews! Jews!

19:30.929 --> 19:33.531
Dude, we better not make
any new friends on this trip.

19:33.632 --> 19:35.232
- It's not about friends.
- Right.

19:35.334 --> 19:37.835
- It's that it's free.
- It's about Israel.

19:37.936 --> 19:39.770
It's like Africa for Jews.

19:39.871 --> 19:41.639
It's about our souls.

19:41.740 --> 19:43.774
People find their
selves in the motherland.

19:43.875 --> 19:46.210
- Jews! Jews!
- All right, ladies.

19:46.311 --> 19:47.678
Where are you seated?

19:47.779 --> 19:49.447
- Uh... 5-B.
- I'm 18D.

19:49.548 --> 19:51.215
(gasping) No!

19:51.316 --> 19:52.583
- No, no, no, no!
- Oh, my God!

19:52.684 --> 19:54.018
- No, no, no, no, no...
- Wait, hold on.

19:54.119 --> 19:55.987
- Okay.
- Uh, ladies, is there something wrong?

19:56.088 --> 19:57.421
Yes. Jared. What's up?

19:57.522 --> 19:58.556
We love the trip so far.

19:58.657 --> 20:00.725
We would love it even more

20:00.826 --> 20:02.360
if we could sit next to each other.

20:02.461 --> 20:04.562
This is an all-expense
paid trip to Israel,

20:04.663 --> 20:06.764
provided by your living ancestors,

20:06.865 --> 20:09.066
so we're seated according
to match potential.

20:09.167 --> 20:10.534
- Okay.
- All right.

20:10.636 --> 20:12.336
Okay.

20:15.173 --> 20:17.174
You'll meet somebody
very nice, I'm sure.

20:20.946 --> 20:22.346
Hey. I'm Josh.

20:22.447 --> 20:23.614
I'm a junior accountant,

20:23.715 --> 20:25.082
I write short stories in my spare time,

20:25.183 --> 20:27.785
and I'm a tough mudder champion.

20:27.886 --> 20:30.187
What? I'm grieving.

20:30.288 --> 20:32.390
I've just experienced a loss.

20:34.393 --> 20:36.894
Would it kill you to try?

20:40.265 --> 20:42.466
Ugh.

20:42.567 --> 20:44.201
Enchanté.

20:51.109 --> 20:52.677
I miss you.

20:52.778 --> 20:54.345
I miss you!

20:54.446 --> 20:56.069
(both) To be continued.

21:02.020 --> 21:04.055
Jews! Jews! Jews! Jews!

21:04.156 --> 21:06.157
Jews! Jews! Jews! Jews!

21:06.258 --> 21:08.359
Jews! Jews! Jews! Jews! Jews!

21:08.460 --> 21:10.361
Jews! Jews!

21:10.462 --> 21:12.396
Jews! Jews!

21:12.497 --> 21:14.031
Jews! Jews! Jews! Jews!

21:14.132 --> 21:16.905
Jews! Jews! Jews! Jews!
