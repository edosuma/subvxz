WEBVTT

00:01.175 --> 00:02.654
Previously onCharmed...

00:02.698 --> 00:04.700
What we do know
is that the Harbinger

00:04.743 --> 00:06.528
couldn't have traveled far
in its primordial form.

00:06.571 --> 00:08.965
So it must've taken
a human vessel
somewhere near Macy's lab.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.010
Because as soon
as they do find

00:10.053 --> 00:11.620
this demon
of unspeakable horror...

00:14.797 --> 00:16.625
...it will fall upon you three
to vanquish it,

00:16.668 --> 00:18.148
as the Charmed Ones.

00:18.192 --> 00:19.758
I come here for brunch all
the time, I've never seen you.

00:19.802 --> 00:21.630
Maybe you just
didn't notice me.

00:21.673 --> 00:23.066
Not possible.

00:23.110 --> 00:24.589
Do you remember Angela Wu?

00:24.633 --> 00:26.200
The one harassed
by Professor Thaine.

00:26.243 --> 00:28.854
It turns out, she woke up
from her coma the same night

00:28.898 --> 00:30.117
we found the
Harbinger's residue.

00:32.510 --> 00:35.600
Maggie, this party is so extra.

00:35.644 --> 00:39.256
Meet my boyfriend,
Parker.

00:39.300 --> 00:41.171
You've barely said a word
to me all night.

00:41.215 --> 00:42.912
Family emergency.

00:45.306 --> 00:46.394
Angela

00:46.437 --> 00:47.569
Oh!

00:47.612 --> 00:48.831
Macy!

00:48.874 --> 00:51.703
Until the Elders arrive,

00:51.747 --> 00:54.097
you must keep it
under constant supervision.

00:54.141 --> 00:56.273
Just think of it as a puppy
that you've always wanted.

01:02.279 --> 01:04.238
MARISOL:
He'll call it a witch hunt.

01:04.281 --> 01:06.370
That's what scared men do.

01:08.807 --> 01:11.114
Professor Thaine is
a world-famous geneticist

01:11.158 --> 01:13.290
whose discoveries
have saved lives.

01:13.334 --> 01:16.685
It'd be like accusing Santa
of sexual harassment.

01:16.728 --> 01:19.296
People will hate me.

01:19.340 --> 01:21.907
Some people will, sure,

01:21.951 --> 01:23.866
but the others
will be inspired by you

01:23.909 --> 01:25.520
to speak up for themselves.

01:25.563 --> 01:28.523
MEL: I heard rumors about the
jerk since I was an undergrad.

01:28.566 --> 01:31.091
Like I was telling Mom,
you can't be the only student

01:31.134 --> 01:33.093
he's treated like this.

01:33.136 --> 01:35.225
So you're saying
I should report him?

01:35.269 --> 01:37.923
Hell yes. Think of it this way:

01:37.967 --> 01:40.752
if you don't, he'll just keep
doing this to other women.

01:40.796 --> 01:41.710
Angela.

01:41.753 --> 01:43.625
You need to make
that decision

01:43.668 --> 01:45.279
for yourself.

01:45.322 --> 01:48.543
And no matter what you decide,
I will be here to support you,

01:48.586 --> 01:50.066
because you're not alone.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.764
Do you hear me

02:09.651 --> 02:11.827
Angela?

02:15.570 --> 02:17.398
Oh, my God, Mel,

02:17.441 --> 02:20.183
you have to stop
getting so close.

02:20.227 --> 02:24.274
I'm here for my shift of doom.
Go live your life.

02:24.318 --> 02:27.973
Dante? Good choice.
Which ring of hell is this?

02:28.017 --> 02:30.237
No idea. Let's just say
I'm way behind

02:30.280 --> 02:32.064
on my class reading
for obvious reasons.

02:32.108 --> 02:35.329
I will spread pestilence,
death and disaster,

02:35.372 --> 02:37.940
and The Source
will rise!

02:37.983 --> 02:39.289
Is it weird I don't even
find it disturbing

02:39.333 --> 02:41.204
when Harbie speaks anymore?

02:41.248 --> 02:43.250
This whole scenario
has been normalized.

02:43.293 --> 02:44.555
I blame the President.

02:44.599 --> 02:46.514
And you gave it a nickname?

02:46.557 --> 02:48.124
Yeah, so it'd be less scary.

02:49.256 --> 02:50.474
Oh, my God!

02:50.518 --> 02:52.172
Seriously, Maggie?

02:52.215 --> 02:53.782
We have the Harbinger
of doom in our attic

02:53.825 --> 02:55.262
and you're worried
about a rat?

02:55.305 --> 02:57.002
Stop, that thing will eat you.

03:03.444 --> 03:05.228
Or do that.

03:09.276 --> 03:13.193
MEL:
I can't go on like this.

03:13.236 --> 03:14.716
Especially now that the
Harbinger's developed

03:14.759 --> 03:17.153
the ability to kill
with a single touch.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.155
I can't wait for
the Elders to get here.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.157
I didn't sleep,
I'm so jumpy.

03:21.201 --> 03:24.639
Oh, come on, as if my unpaid job

03:24.682 --> 03:26.902
as the nanny of pure evil
isn't bad enough,

03:26.945 --> 03:29.470
I'm flunking
out of school.You're in school?

03:29.513 --> 03:31.863
Of course I'm in school.
I'm a freshman.

03:31.907 --> 03:34.170
I'm just not sure I've
ever seen you go to class.

03:34.214 --> 03:37.565
Well, I have. Just not
World Lit that much.

03:37.608 --> 03:39.958
My professor
e-mailed;

03:40.002 --> 03:42.265
if I fail, I'm on
academic probation.

03:42.309 --> 03:44.833
You can ace the midterms.
It's not the end of the world.

03:44.876 --> 03:47.270
That is up
in the attic.

03:47.314 --> 03:49.229
Maybe I just
drop the class?

03:49.272 --> 03:50.317
I mean,
it's not too late

03:50.360 --> 03:51.840
and I'm under
a lot of pressure.

03:51.883 --> 03:54.669
Uh, then maybe you should
drop Kappa, not your class.

03:54.712 --> 03:56.540
Not this again. Harry!

03:57.933 --> 03:59.456
This situation
has us all on edge.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.328
I am well aware
of that fact.

04:01.371 --> 04:02.807
Where are the Elders?

04:02.851 --> 04:05.027
They're analyzing
a 5,000-year-old prophecy,

04:05.070 --> 04:06.942
making sure they find
the right method to vanquish

04:06.985 --> 04:08.813
the demon and gather
the correct supplies.

04:08.857 --> 04:10.815
There is no room for mistakes.

04:13.992 --> 04:15.907
HARRY: Ah, well,
perhaps that's them now.

04:15.951 --> 04:18.301
How do I look?
Great.

04:18.345 --> 04:21.522
No, it's Niko,
with Trip.

04:21.565 --> 04:24.176
Not a great time for a visit
from the local law enforcement.

04:25.482 --> 04:27.484
Get rid of them.

04:30.748 --> 04:33.142
Angela's mother filed
a missing person's report.

04:33.185 --> 04:37.146
Last place she was seen
was your Halloween party.

04:37.189 --> 04:40.323
Poor Angela.
She's been through so much.

04:41.890 --> 04:44.762
You didn't see her
leave with anybody?

04:44.806 --> 04:48.549
It was so crowded,
a-and everybody was in costume.

04:48.592 --> 04:50.768
I honestly couldn't tell her
from the other ten zombies

04:50.812 --> 04:52.509
that were here. Right, Maggie?

04:52.553 --> 04:57.166
Right. Because that was,
that was her costume.

04:57.209 --> 04:58.472
She was a zombie.

04:58.515 --> 04:59.777
It was just
a costume.

05:03.303 --> 05:06.741
Oh, my God, why are you babbling
on about Angela's costume?

05:06.784 --> 05:08.656
So they won't think I'm saying
she's really a zombie,

05:08.699 --> 05:10.092
which she
basically is.

05:10.135 --> 05:12.399
They're not going to suspect
she's really a zombie.

05:12.442 --> 05:14.009
Okay, I know, okay,
I'm just really nervous.

05:14.052 --> 05:15.837
You're the one who can't
look Niko in the eyes.

05:15.880 --> 05:16.881
She's right.

05:16.925 --> 05:18.100
It's weird.

05:18.143 --> 05:20.363
Okay.

05:20.407 --> 05:22.539
Let's just all
act normal.

05:27.892 --> 05:30.591
So none of you have had contact
with her since the party?

05:30.634 --> 05:33.376
I didn't really know her.

05:33.420 --> 05:34.899
I haven't
heard from her.

05:34.943 --> 05:36.205
Yeah, me neither.

05:38.642 --> 05:39.904
What was that noise?

05:39.948 --> 05:41.689
Um...

05:41.732 --> 05:43.125
What noise?

05:43.168 --> 05:44.518
What's going on
upstairs?

05:46.911 --> 05:50.741
Ugh, sorry, sorry
for all of the racket.

05:50.785 --> 05:52.264
Anatoli dropped
an ottoman.

05:52.308 --> 05:53.396
We will absolutely pay

05:53.440 --> 05:54.876
for any damages, though,
do not worry.

05:54.919 --> 05:56.921
Hi, I'm Charity Callahan,
interior designer.

05:56.965 --> 05:58.270
Sorry, two of my guys
are up there

05:58.314 --> 06:00.098
taking measurements. So, listen,

06:00.142 --> 06:03.319
I'm thinking the whole
boho Victorian thing...

06:03.363 --> 06:04.886
Too on the nose.

06:04.929 --> 06:06.844
Let's play against it, huh?

06:06.888 --> 06:09.238
With a little minimalist
Scandinavian farmhouse, hmm?

06:09.281 --> 06:10.544
Some warm woods,

06:10.587 --> 06:12.023
some well-chosen plant life.

06:12.067 --> 06:15.418
Voila! Your attic becomes
a chicly-Hygge winter den.

06:15.462 --> 06:19.814
Well, we should get back
to our chicly-Hygge winter den.

06:19.857 --> 06:21.119
Yes.
We should.

06:21.163 --> 06:22.730
You're redecorating the attic?

06:22.773 --> 06:23.861
CHARITY:
Eh, it's more like

06:23.905 --> 06:24.949
a rebirth of what the attic

06:24.993 --> 06:26.647
was always meant to be, hmm?

06:26.690 --> 06:29.389
I-I wish we could
be more helpful.

06:29.432 --> 06:32.087
Truly, you know,
we're all worried about Angela.

06:34.132 --> 06:35.786
Okay.

06:40.965 --> 06:44.621
If you think of anything else...We will definitely
be in touch.

06:44.665 --> 06:47.102
And I'll talk
to you later.
Okay.

07:03.684 --> 07:06.338
Who are you?

07:06.382 --> 07:08.993
Charity. The Elder.

07:09.037 --> 07:10.038
And I am so sorry

07:10.081 --> 07:11.518
to have kept you waiting.

07:11.561 --> 07:14.172
You're an Elder?

07:15.304 --> 07:17.306
I j-just thought you'd all be...

07:17.349 --> 07:19.264
What, old?
I know, I know, I know.

07:19.308 --> 07:21.310
I've been saying
we need to rebrand.

07:21.353 --> 07:22.964
Are you also an
interior designer?

07:23.007 --> 07:24.574
'Cause that was, like,
super impressive.

07:24.618 --> 07:27.185
: Oh, God no.
No, no, no, no.

07:27.229 --> 07:30.493
I just watch a lot of HGTV
while I'm on the treadmill.

07:30.537 --> 07:32.800
In reality,
I run an investment fund

07:32.843 --> 07:35.498
that uses microloans to help
women in developing nations

07:35.542 --> 07:37.065
start their
own businesses.

07:37.108 --> 07:40.721
We are tackling poverty
and inequality through ethical,

07:40.764 --> 07:44.028
female-focused
capitalism.

07:44.072 --> 07:45.334
Well, we're glad you're here

07:45.377 --> 07:46.988
because we're done
harboring the Harbinger.

07:47.031 --> 07:48.555
So how do we save Angela?

07:48.598 --> 07:51.514
Save Angela? Oh, no, no, no,
she can't be saved.

07:51.558 --> 07:54.343
She has to be killed.
Tonight, during the full moon.

07:55.779 --> 07:57.041
With this.

07:57.085 --> 07:58.173
Don't worry,

07:58.216 --> 08:00.044
you each get one.

08:00.088 --> 08:02.177
Thank you.

08:04.092 --> 08:05.267
All right, let's go see
this thing, huh?

08:07.878 --> 08:10.098
We have to
kill Angela?

08:19.586 --> 08:21.936
So these Elders are just sadists
who kill anybody

08:21.979 --> 08:24.025
who gets in their way?
I mean, that's how they operate?

08:24.068 --> 08:27.028
Certainly not. They are
the governing body of witches,

08:27.071 --> 08:29.421
and if they say killing
the creature is the only way,

08:29.465 --> 08:31.989
it's the only way.

08:32.033 --> 08:34.035
The Elders
don't make mistakes.

08:34.078 --> 08:37.429
It's not a creature,
it's Angela.

08:37.473 --> 08:39.475
And why can't we just
get it out of her?

08:39.519 --> 08:41.129
I mean, we got that
demon out of Brian.

08:41.172 --> 08:42.347
That was just a demon.

08:42.391 --> 08:44.088
This is the Harbinger.

08:47.483 --> 08:49.703
Uh, good day, Elder Callahan.

08:49.746 --> 08:51.052
Glad you arrived safely.

08:51.966 --> 08:53.707
When you didn't respond
to this straightaway,

08:53.750 --> 08:55.535
I did grow a little concerned.

08:55.578 --> 08:57.232
Well, you know how it is, Harry.

08:57.275 --> 08:59.843
Preparations for a ritual
killing are time-consuming.

08:59.887 --> 09:01.018
Indeed.

09:01.062 --> 09:02.411
Ladies.

09:03.673 --> 09:07.111
I've placed a containment spell
over the Harbinger.

09:07.155 --> 09:09.853
While it holds,
its touch won't be lethal.

09:09.897 --> 09:12.029
However, it will fade
by tonight's full moon.

09:12.073 --> 09:13.857
That's when you three
must perform the killing

09:13.901 --> 09:15.250
before it becomes
too powerful to stop.

09:17.382 --> 09:18.862
Something wrong?

09:18.906 --> 09:20.168
Something wrong?

09:20.211 --> 09:22.170
Our friend has been
possessed by a demon

09:22.213 --> 09:24.607
in our attic for two days,
and you just waltz in here

09:24.651 --> 09:26.957
and announce that we're supposed
to kill her instead of save her.

09:27.001 --> 09:29.481
Mel, one defers to an Elder.
Think of her as royalty.

09:29.525 --> 09:32.093
Do not reveal your monarchist
side to me right now, Harry.

09:32.136 --> 09:33.485
I was just starting to like you.

09:33.529 --> 09:34.617
I-It's all right.

09:34.661 --> 09:36.488
I understand.

09:36.532 --> 09:38.229
It's a shock,

09:38.273 --> 09:39.666
but this is
a critical time.

09:39.709 --> 09:42.843
There was another
Elder assassination.

09:42.886 --> 09:44.845
That's why I came alone.
Security protocol.

09:44.888 --> 09:46.934
An Elder was killed?Yes.

09:46.977 --> 09:48.022
The third one
since your mother.

09:48.065 --> 09:50.328
Our mother was an Elder?

09:50.372 --> 09:52.417
Harry, you didn't tell us
our mother was an Elder.

09:52.461 --> 09:55.333
I most certainly did,
during my opening speech,

09:55.377 --> 09:57.118
when I told you three
you were witches.

09:57.161 --> 10:00.121
No, I distinctly remember you
used the term "senior" witches.

10:00.164 --> 10:02.602
Which means exactly
the same thing.

10:05.430 --> 10:08.259
You just muted him.

10:09.870 --> 10:12.829
That's one of
her powers.

10:12.873 --> 10:15.963
Among many,
many others.

10:16.006 --> 10:17.312
Okay, then why can't
you handle this?

10:17.355 --> 10:18.574
Well, I would
if I could.

10:18.618 --> 10:21.751
But the ritual requires
the Power of Three,

10:21.795 --> 10:23.753
and only the Charmed Ones
have that.

10:23.797 --> 10:26.930
Trust me, this is
new territory for us, too.

10:26.974 --> 10:28.932
So you knew our mother?

10:28.976 --> 10:31.108
Oh, very well.

10:31.152 --> 10:32.980
She was a dear friend.

10:33.023 --> 10:35.722
Then you should know
she would never let Angela die.

10:35.765 --> 10:38.289
Angela was someone
she was trying to save.

10:39.464 --> 10:41.162
Isn't there some other way?

10:41.205 --> 10:43.381
Like an exorcism?

10:43.425 --> 10:46.080
An exorcism is only effective
if there's a soul to be saved.

10:46.123 --> 10:48.125
With a demon this powerful
possessing her,

10:48.169 --> 10:50.475
I'm afraid Angela is gone.

10:50.519 --> 10:52.129
We can't just give up.

10:52.173 --> 10:55.611
I'm sorry.
I know it's hard, I do.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.569
But, by the end
of tonight's full moon,

10:57.613 --> 11:00.398
the Harbinger will reach
full strength.

11:00.442 --> 11:02.618
Which means no chains
can hold it.
HARRY:
And as you know

11:02.662 --> 11:05.186
from our training sessions,
at that point the Harbinger

11:05.229 --> 11:07.971
summons the Source
with a deluge of blood.

11:08.015 --> 11:09.756
It's homecoming weekend.

11:09.799 --> 11:11.888
Every hotel in town
is booked with people.

11:11.932 --> 11:13.368
People filled with blood.

11:13.411 --> 11:16.501
Jeez, Macy,
that's dark.And true.

11:16.545 --> 11:18.068
If Angela's already gone...

11:20.505 --> 11:21.985
I'll prepare things here.

11:22.029 --> 11:23.073
You three get
your affairs in order.

11:23.117 --> 11:24.988
We commence at sundown.

11:25.032 --> 11:27.034
Oh, and keep an eye
on your girlfriend.

11:27.077 --> 11:29.645
The detective? She and her
partner were certainly curious.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.081
We cannot have them
sniffing around.

11:33.170 --> 11:34.737
We can't do it;
we can't kill Angela.

11:34.781 --> 11:37.609
You heard witch-Olivia-Pope;
there's no Angela left.

11:37.653 --> 11:39.611
That enough to just do
this ritual killing?

11:39.655 --> 11:41.222
I shouldn't have to make
decisions like this,

11:41.265 --> 11:42.614
I can't even pass World Lit.

11:42.658 --> 11:44.225
I know it's harder for you
because you knew her,

11:44.268 --> 11:46.836
but you're letting your
emotions cloud your judgment.

11:46.880 --> 11:50.710
If we can save all of these
people from dying like that rat,

11:50.753 --> 11:51.754
there's really
no other option.

11:51.798 --> 11:54.148
Wow, that's cold.

11:54.191 --> 11:55.236
No, it's rational.

11:55.279 --> 11:56.454
And that thing did try

11:56.498 --> 11:58.108
to kill me on Halloween,
so forgive me

11:58.152 --> 12:00.197
if I'm having trouble
bonding with it.

12:00.241 --> 12:02.199
If you'll excuse me,
I have to get to work.

12:06.160 --> 12:09.337
Maybe there's a way to prove
that Angela's still in there.

12:09.380 --> 12:10.773
You think Charity's wrong?

12:10.817 --> 12:13.167
I think she's too confident
that she's right.

12:13.210 --> 12:14.298
And Mom would
want us to be sure.

12:14.342 --> 12:15.386
Well, don't be expecting me

12:15.430 --> 12:17.388
to touch it
and read its thoughts.

12:17.432 --> 12:19.042
You saw what
it did to that rat.

12:19.086 --> 12:20.827
I mean like a spell
or something.

12:20.870 --> 12:23.264
I'm gonna head home and
check The Book of Shadows.

12:23.307 --> 12:25.222
You're supposed to be
keeping an eye on Niko.

12:25.266 --> 12:26.310
Make sure she's
not suspicious.

12:26.354 --> 12:28.356
It can wait.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.969
TRIP: I'm sorry,
but she's hiding something.

12:33.013 --> 12:35.842
They all are.
I can feel it.

12:35.885 --> 12:39.193
Trip, Mel did not kidnap
Angela Wu, okay? That's absurd.

12:39.236 --> 12:40.585
Come on, you saw
how jumpy she was.

12:40.629 --> 12:42.631
Yeah, she gets
nervous around cops,

12:42.674 --> 12:44.546
as plenty of
people of color do.

12:44.589 --> 12:46.287
Plus, she hates guns.

12:46.330 --> 12:47.984
She won't even let me bring
my sidearm into the house,

12:48.028 --> 12:49.464
so just chill, okay?

12:49.507 --> 12:50.857
Okay.

12:50.900 --> 12:53.468
I'm just saying,
it was weird.

12:53.511 --> 12:55.383
You know, maybe
we should focus on

12:55.426 --> 12:57.428
whoever killed all
those people on Halloween,

12:57.472 --> 12:59.213
because Angela Wu
could be their next victim.

12:59.256 --> 13:02.477
Or you think my girlfriend
did that, too?

13:02.520 --> 13:03.783
Point taken.

13:03.826 --> 13:05.001
Mm-hmm.

13:07.917 --> 13:10.180
Thank you.
Let's go.

13:11.965 --> 13:13.836
"Abandon all hope

13:13.880 --> 13:16.317
ye who enter here."

13:16.360 --> 13:18.580
Dante's inscription
above the gates of hell.

13:18.623 --> 13:20.277
As Dante passes
through those gates,

13:20.321 --> 13:22.279
he hears the
screams of the...

13:22.323 --> 13:24.847
...Uncommitted.

13:24.891 --> 13:26.806
The selfish cowards who
wouldn't take a stand

13:26.849 --> 13:28.851
for either good
or evil on earth.

13:28.895 --> 13:31.462
That's it for today.
We'll see you on Friday

13:31.506 --> 13:33.203
for the midterm;
closed book.

13:33.247 --> 13:36.119
Eight essay questions carefully
engineered so I'll know

13:36.163 --> 13:37.425
if you just read SparkNotes.

13:37.468 --> 13:40.254
And don't forget:
it's 50% of your grade.

13:41.298 --> 13:42.996
LUCY:
Maggie!

13:43.039 --> 13:46.042
Maggie! How have
I never seen you

13:46.086 --> 13:47.609
in this class before?

13:47.652 --> 13:49.741
Oh, um, I usually
sit in the back,

13:49.785 --> 13:51.613
kind of slept through a few.

13:51.656 --> 13:54.268
I'm lucky; I only need four
hours of sleep a night.

13:54.311 --> 13:55.617
I am one of those people.

13:55.660 --> 13:58.098
Do you want to
walk over together?
What?

13:58.141 --> 14:00.100
We're putting the final touches
on the homecoming float.

14:00.143 --> 14:02.058
Oh, my God.

14:02.102 --> 14:03.843
I'm so sorry, I can't make it.

14:03.886 --> 14:06.280
Look, I'm on the verge
of flunking this class,

14:06.323 --> 14:07.498
so I have to ace the midterm,

14:07.542 --> 14:08.935
but I've only read
half the book.

14:08.978 --> 14:10.110
Well, honey, why
didn't you say so?

14:10.153 --> 14:11.154
Don't worry; Parker
can help-- Parker!

14:11.198 --> 14:13.635
Parker.MAGGIE: Oh, he can?

14:13.678 --> 14:16.943
Yes; my bae is not
only a literary genius,

14:16.986 --> 14:19.728
he also read Dante
in middle school.Mm-hmm.

14:21.382 --> 14:22.992
My dad liked to assign us
a classic piece

14:23.036 --> 14:24.776
of literature
to discuss at dinner.

14:24.820 --> 14:26.909
And yes, it's as fun
as it sounds.

14:28.258 --> 14:30.434
Can you help Maggie
ace the midterm for me?

14:30.478 --> 14:33.220
I can't have my favorite pledge
bring down our house GPA.

14:34.830 --> 14:36.049
PARKER:
Sure, no problem.

14:36.092 --> 14:37.920
Then it's decided.

14:37.964 --> 14:39.139
Thanks.

14:48.104 --> 14:49.932
Oh, my gosh.

14:49.976 --> 14:51.151
Something wrong?

14:54.328 --> 14:56.460
Just thinking.

14:56.504 --> 14:57.766
A

14:57.809 --> 15:01.596
You know, utilitarianism.

15:05.295 --> 15:08.211
You do know daydreaming is
supposed to be fun, right?

15:08.255 --> 15:11.519
Like, if I got trapped
in Drake's body,

15:11.562 --> 15:14.043
what's the first
ridiculous thing I'd buy?

15:15.436 --> 15:16.698
You were seriously
sitting over there

15:16.741 --> 15:18.178
thinking about
utilitarianism?

15:18.221 --> 15:22.617
M-My sisters and I like
to do breakfast trivia.

15:22.660 --> 15:24.053
So tell me.

15:24.097 --> 15:26.142
If you had to choose
to kill one person,

15:26.186 --> 15:28.623
or, say, all of Hilltowne

15:28.666 --> 15:30.320
would almost certainly
die, would you do it?

15:30.364 --> 15:32.105
Nope.

15:32.148 --> 15:34.063
You said
"almost certainly,"

15:34.107 --> 15:36.848
so, if there's a chance,
then I'm gonna find another way.

15:36.892 --> 15:38.763
But we're scientists.

15:38.807 --> 15:40.852
If, statistically,
the risk of saving this one

15:40.896 --> 15:44.117
could kill thousands...Look, I know it would
make sense rationally,

15:44.160 --> 15:46.989
but it would feel so wrong.

15:47.033 --> 15:48.338
I-I don't think
I could kill someone.

15:48.382 --> 15:49.687
No, of course
it would feel wrong.

15:49.731 --> 15:51.559
But, we have to make judgments

15:51.602 --> 15:55.389
based on fact, not
emotions, don't we?

15:55.432 --> 15:57.565
I don't know.

15:57.608 --> 15:59.697
Who's to say emotions

15:59.741 --> 16:01.612
aren't just as valuable?

16:03.266 --> 16:04.833
Look, I-I know we're scientists,
but it doesn't mean

16:04.876 --> 16:06.748
we have to be cold,
you know?

16:06.791 --> 16:08.837
Listen, I didn't
come over here

16:08.880 --> 16:11.318
to talk about
moral hypotheticals.

16:11.361 --> 16:15.104
You've just been so busy
since Halloween,

16:15.148 --> 16:20.109
um, we haven't really
had a chance to talk.

16:20.153 --> 16:24.809
So, would you like to go

16:24.853 --> 16:27.160
to the homecoming tailgate
with me tonight?

16:28.204 --> 16:31.816
Tonight.

16:31.860 --> 16:35.037
I would love to,
I really would,

16:35.081 --> 16:37.561
i-it's just...

16:37.605 --> 16:39.259
I have a thing.

16:39.302 --> 16:41.261
With my sisters.

16:43.393 --> 16:45.395
Understood.

16:45.439 --> 16:46.831
Maybe some other time.

16:57.842 --> 17:00.932
How do I tell
if Angela's still in there?

17:10.638 --> 17:12.596
Anima revelare.

17:14.772 --> 17:17.036
Veni foras.

17:21.127 --> 17:23.912
Where am I?
What's happening?

17:23.955 --> 17:25.783
Angela?

17:25.827 --> 17:28.351
Mel

17:31.050 --> 17:32.094
Angela.

17:32.138 --> 17:34.140
Hold on.

17:34.183 --> 17:36.098
Help me, it's too strong...

17:41.321 --> 17:43.584
She's really in there.

17:43.627 --> 17:47.022
And she's never coming out.

17:47.066 --> 17:51.026
We'll see about that.

17:58.860 --> 18:01.732
I understand, but our main goal
isn't to maximize profits;

18:01.776 --> 18:04.909
it's to build communities
of women supporting women.

18:04.953 --> 18:06.824
I need to run,
can we pick this up later?

18:06.868 --> 18:08.522
Mm-hmm.

18:08.565 --> 18:10.437
Charity, there was
a lost souls spell

18:10.480 --> 18:12.134
in the Bookand
Angela came out.

18:12.178 --> 18:13.875
Not literally, she's still
trapped inside with that thing.

18:13.918 --> 18:16.095
But what I mean is,
her soul is still alive.

18:16.138 --> 18:17.400
She's just trapped inside.

18:17.444 --> 18:18.967
This is what you've been up to?

18:19.010 --> 18:20.447
I told you to keep an
eye on your girlfriend.

18:20.490 --> 18:23.363
You said Angela
was gone and she isn't.
Fine.

18:23.406 --> 18:24.886
I was wrong, then,
I can admit that,

18:24.929 --> 18:26.235
but it does not
change the calculus,

18:26.279 --> 18:28.194
we still must follow through
with the ritual killing.

18:28.237 --> 18:30.065
"Calculus"?

18:30.109 --> 18:31.240
What about
"women supporting women"?

18:31.284 --> 18:33.024
There's a woman
that needs our help

18:33.068 --> 18:34.156
and you want me to kill her?

18:34.200 --> 18:35.766
It is for the greater good.

18:35.810 --> 18:38.378
A demon this powerful has
never been exorcised before.

18:38.421 --> 18:39.988
Which doesn't mean
it can't be done.

18:40.031 --> 18:41.468
Mel, you're an impressive witch,

18:41.511 --> 18:43.644
but you don't know
what you don't know.

18:43.687 --> 18:46.473
Let me be a source
of wisdom for you.

18:46.516 --> 18:48.518
That's what we Elders
are here to help do.

18:48.562 --> 18:50.477
My mom was an Elder, too.

18:50.520 --> 18:52.348
And she would have
never done this.

18:52.392 --> 18:55.090
She would want me
to find a way to save Angela.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.483
And I knew your mother
in a different way.

18:56.526 --> 18:59.573
As a witch with
incredible discernment

18:59.616 --> 19:02.489
and the ability to do
what had to be done,

19:02.532 --> 19:03.707
no matter what.

19:03.751 --> 19:05.100
And as her fellow Elder,

19:05.144 --> 19:08.059
I am telling you that
an exorcism is a non-starter.

19:08.103 --> 19:10.845
And frankly, I don't
have the time...
What if I do
it anyway?

19:10.888 --> 19:12.063
Knock yourself out.

19:15.632 --> 19:17.460
You need a voice
to speak a spell.

19:17.504 --> 19:19.332
It's not happening;
are we clear?

19:34.260 --> 19:35.652
We don't have
much time.
What happened?

19:35.696 --> 19:37.132
Is everything okay?I don't know.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.873
I'm just going
on instinct.

19:38.916 --> 19:40.396
Please tell me that's
not Harbie in the trunk.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.181
That's not Harbie
in the trunk.

19:46.272 --> 19:47.664
Mel!

19:47.708 --> 19:50.450
It's not the Harbinger;
it's Angela Wu.

19:50.493 --> 19:52.016
I did a soul spell and
she's still in there.

19:52.060 --> 19:54.236
And when I told Charity,
she couldn't care less.

19:54.280 --> 19:56.978
And since Macy's as clinical
as Charity, I had no choice.

19:57.021 --> 19:59.110
Please tell me you have
a plan other than driving

19:59.154 --> 20:01.852
a super lethal demon around
Hilltowne in our hatchback.

20:01.896 --> 20:04.203
We literally left
five minutes ago,

20:04.246 --> 20:06.205
of course I don't
have a plan.

20:06.248 --> 20:07.815
I used to hate studying.

20:07.858 --> 20:09.469
Now I'd give anything just to
be cramming for my midterm.

20:09.512 --> 20:11.253
I have The Book of Shadows.

20:11.297 --> 20:13.516
We'll find an exorcism spell,
get this thing out of Angela

20:13.560 --> 20:15.475
before it's too
powerful to stop us.

20:15.518 --> 20:17.999
We just need to find
somewhere private.

20:18.042 --> 20:20.306
I know a place.

20:20.349 --> 20:21.829
Oh, no, no, no.

20:21.872 --> 20:23.265
Oh, no, no,

20:23.309 --> 20:25.354
no, no, no, no, no, no....What?

20:25.398 --> 20:28.749
Don't look now, but I think
Trip is following us.

20:30.577 --> 20:32.361
Maggie, get down!Hey!

20:32.405 --> 20:34.363
Well, what are we gonna do?

20:34.407 --> 20:36.322
I can freeze time, remember?

20:36.365 --> 20:37.801
We'll just drive away.

20:37.845 --> 20:39.063
But then it's gonna look
like our car just disappeared.

20:39.107 --> 20:40.891
Well, what other choice
do we have?

20:40.935 --> 20:41.849
Get in the car.

20:41.892 --> 20:44.330
Get in the car! Go.Okay.

20:49.073 --> 20:50.858
MAGGIE:
Freakin' weirdo.

20:52.033 --> 20:54.383
NIKO:
Hey, Trip, I'm at the station.

20:54.427 --> 20:56.385
Where are you?

20:56.429 --> 20:58.779
Hello?

20:58.822 --> 21:00.563
Hey, are you there?
What are you doing?

21:00.607 --> 21:02.609
I got to call you back.NIKO: Wait, hey...

21:02.652 --> 21:04.959
MACY:
I put it under the microscope.

21:05.002 --> 21:07.309
What killed the rat is similar
in DNA structure to smallpox,

21:07.353 --> 21:09.964
only much more lethal
because it kills instantly.

21:10.007 --> 21:12.140
It's not airborne yet,
but it could be soon.

21:12.183 --> 21:13.533
And if the Harbinger gets loose,

21:13.576 --> 21:15.274
it's a walking pandemic.

21:16.971 --> 21:19.234
Don't worry, we won't
let it come to that.

21:27.373 --> 21:30.463
She disobeyed my orders.

21:30.506 --> 21:33.466
That's Mel's specialty.

21:33.509 --> 21:37.165
Bring them back immediately.

21:40.037 --> 21:43.302
There are a dozen exorcism
spells in here.

21:43.345 --> 21:45.086
Find one that won't
hurt the Kappa float.

21:45.129 --> 21:46.609
Lucy's sure it's gonna win.

21:46.653 --> 21:49.133
Show me an exorcism spell

21:49.177 --> 21:53.007
strong enough to take down
the Harbinger.

21:56.532 --> 21:58.142
It's blank.

21:58.186 --> 21:59.970
What's that mean?

22:04.888 --> 22:06.368
Girls, what the hell
are you doing?

22:06.412 --> 22:08.109
Angela is still in there.

22:08.152 --> 22:10.677
I cast a spell and I saw her.You did?

22:10.720 --> 22:11.852
But that...

22:11.895 --> 22:14.115
MEL:
That's right.

22:14.158 --> 22:15.377
Charity was wrong.

22:15.421 --> 22:17.466
We can't kill Angela now.

22:17.510 --> 22:19.729
But the full moon is rising.

22:19.773 --> 22:22.906
And soon Elder Callahan's
containment spell will wear off.

22:22.950 --> 22:25.909
I see no other choice
but to take it back to the house

22:25.953 --> 22:28.216
and do the ritual killing
as planned.

22:28.259 --> 22:30.349
It's not an "it," it's a "her."

22:30.392 --> 22:33.787
And it's partially my fault
that she's in this situation.

22:33.830 --> 22:35.571
HARRY: Whatever
do you mean?

22:35.615 --> 22:38.313
Professor Thaine
was sexually harassing her.

22:38.357 --> 22:41.447
She came to Mom for advice,
and I told her to report it.

22:41.490 --> 22:44.798
She did, and the stress of it
made her OD

22:44.841 --> 22:48.541
and put her in a coma, where she
was possessed by the Harbinger.

22:48.584 --> 22:51.370
I can't kill her.
We have to save Angela.

23:03.556 --> 23:08.735
Your sisters are, uh,
clearly emotional.

23:08.778 --> 23:13.696
But you,
you got a real knack for this.

23:13.740 --> 23:17.134
For what?

23:17.178 --> 23:19.398
Leadership.

23:19.441 --> 23:21.617
Just like your mother.

23:26.405 --> 23:28.363
Did she ever mention me?

23:28.407 --> 23:30.539
No.

23:30.583 --> 23:31.758
No, she never did.

23:31.801 --> 23:34.717
In fact, none of the Elders
knew about you.

23:34.761 --> 23:36.719
We were just as surprised
as you were

23:36.763 --> 23:39.243
when you three became
the Charmed Ones.

23:39.287 --> 23:44.335
But now that I know,
it does make sense.

23:44.379 --> 23:46.337
Years ago,

23:46.381 --> 23:51.560
when we were young witches
just starting out,

23:51.604 --> 23:55.172
she asked me
to place a spell on her.

23:55.216 --> 23:57.479
She wouldn't tell me
what it was about,

23:57.523 --> 24:00.656
just that she couldn't
perform it on herself.

24:00.700 --> 24:05.531
The spell was, uh, brutal.

24:05.574 --> 24:09.578
It extracted
all of her pain and anguish

24:09.622 --> 24:14.714
over some tragic loss,
so she could go on living.

24:16.150 --> 24:20.371
I never knew
what that loss was...

24:20.415 --> 24:22.678
till now.

24:31.339 --> 24:33.297
Sorry.

24:34.777 --> 24:37.954
Would you excuse me
while I get myself together?

24:37.998 --> 24:39.695
Of course.

24:51.620 --> 24:53.709
It had to have flipped there
for a reason.

24:53.753 --> 24:55.798
Maybe it's invisible magic ink?

24:55.842 --> 24:57.974
Can I help?

25:00.411 --> 25:03.458
I want to save Angela.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.158
An anguish spell.

25:08.202 --> 25:09.682
That makes so much sense.

25:09.725 --> 25:13.642
And I'm sorry
for criticizing you

25:13.686 --> 25:15.601
for making your decision
based on your emotions.

25:15.644 --> 25:17.080
I-It's just

25:17.124 --> 25:19.822
I've spent my entire life trying
to keep mine in check.

25:19.866 --> 25:22.738
And-and I guess
it comes off as cold,

25:22.782 --> 25:26.394
but it's how I protect myself.

25:26.437 --> 25:31.660
If Angela really is in
there, I want to save her.

25:33.183 --> 25:34.750
So let's do the exorcism.

25:38.014 --> 25:39.581
MAGGIE: We would if
we could, but...

25:39.625 --> 25:42.584
it opened to this blank page.

25:42.628 --> 25:45.021
That is now magically
revealing itself?

25:47.720 --> 25:52.246
That's... Mom's handwriting.

25:52.289 --> 25:54.204
All of our names are on it.

25:54.248 --> 25:57.338
It's in Spanish.

25:57.381 --> 25:59.775
Looks like
a Santería-based spell.

25:59.819 --> 26:01.908
Unsanctioned by the Elders.

26:01.951 --> 26:04.693
She wrote it for us, but why?

26:06.869 --> 26:09.089
So you three would find it.

26:09.132 --> 26:12.527
She knew this moment would come.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.485
Her power was prophecy.

26:14.529 --> 26:16.879
Ladies, it's fated

26:16.923 --> 26:19.708
you three should unite
in this mission.

26:19.752 --> 26:23.103
Harry, you're
disobeying the Elders?

26:23.146 --> 26:25.453
Not all of them.

26:26.672 --> 26:27.934
Mom.

26:30.153 --> 26:32.112
So what are you waiting for?

26:32.155 --> 26:34.549
It's time to save Angela Wu.

26:43.645 --> 26:47.257
Here we are,
the sacred container

26:47.301 --> 26:49.564
to imprison the demon.

26:49.608 --> 26:51.566
It's either that
or a crushed beer can,

26:51.610 --> 26:54.438
ladies, take your pick.

26:54.482 --> 26:57.354
All right, so do we have
everything we need?

26:57.398 --> 26:58.747
Can we please
just do this already?

26:58.791 --> 27:01.228
MEL: "Enchanted vessel
to trap the Harbinger."

27:01.271 --> 27:05.493
Got it. We have the incantation
spell right here.

27:05.536 --> 27:08.801
This says that
we have to lay hands.

27:10.106 --> 27:12.674
Touch her? No.

27:12.718 --> 27:14.154
Did you see
what it did to that rat?

27:14.197 --> 27:15.851
Maggie's right. The full
moon is approaching,

27:15.895 --> 27:18.027
and the containment spell
is wearing off. One touch...

27:18.071 --> 27:19.768
And we all get
its pestilence and die.

27:19.812 --> 27:21.552
HARRY:
Exactly.

27:21.596 --> 27:23.293
Then we can't do
the exorcism spell.

27:23.337 --> 27:27.558
We can if we use chemical
resistant nitrile gloves.

27:27.602 --> 27:28.647
We wear them
in the lab

27:28.690 --> 27:30.474
when handling
hazardous materials.

27:30.518 --> 27:33.303
If we wear them, I'm almost
certain we'll survive.

27:33.347 --> 27:36.263
You're almost certain?Maggie, we have
no other choice.

27:36.306 --> 27:38.265
I know, but do we really
have to touch her?

27:38.308 --> 27:41.050
It's gonna be a gazillion times
worse for me.

27:41.094 --> 27:43.923
I'm gonna be reading
her monster mind. It's too much.

27:43.966 --> 27:45.794
I'm supposed to be cramming
for my midterm,

27:45.838 --> 27:47.622
not maybe dying
from a demon virus.

27:48.928 --> 27:51.104
What was that?

27:51.147 --> 27:53.497
I'll find out and get rid of it.

27:53.541 --> 27:56.413
In the meantime, you and Macy
go and get those gloves.

27:56.457 --> 27:57.632
I'll keep an eye on Angela.

27:57.676 --> 27:59.852
Okay.Okay.

28:05.596 --> 28:07.381
Hey, you.

28:07.424 --> 28:09.731
Parker.

28:09.775 --> 28:12.560
What are you doing here?

28:12.603 --> 28:14.518
Well, I'm definitely not here

28:14.562 --> 28:16.999
to stash a box of illegal
fireworks to fire off

28:17.043 --> 28:18.740
of the Phi Delta
at Homecoming tomorrow.

28:19.785 --> 28:21.264
I could ask you the same thing.

28:21.308 --> 28:23.049
Shouldn't you be at home,
prepping for our study session?

28:23.092 --> 28:25.704
Oh, I-I'm just... cleaning up.

28:25.747 --> 28:28.924
What's the point
of reading the book?

28:28.968 --> 28:31.231
Never gonna pass
the test anyways.

28:31.274 --> 28:33.233
Hey, I'm offended.

28:33.276 --> 28:34.843
I'm a really good tutor.

28:34.887 --> 28:36.758
Well, you have your work
cut out for you.

28:36.802 --> 28:38.107
I only got into this school

28:38.151 --> 28:40.327
because my mom was
on the faculty.

28:40.370 --> 28:41.720
I haven't
known you long,

28:41.763 --> 28:44.070
but it's clear
you're very smart.

28:44.113 --> 28:49.075
No. My sisters are.

28:49.118 --> 28:52.643
School's just never
really been my thing.

28:52.687 --> 28:56.430
Well, maybe that's just the
story you keep telling yourself.

28:56.473 --> 28:59.215
When I was growing up,
I wanted so badly

28:59.259 --> 29:01.870
to be able to play guitar
like my big brother,

29:01.914 --> 29:05.439
but no matter how much I
practiced, he was always better.

29:05.482 --> 29:08.485
So I told myself
I was just someone

29:08.529 --> 29:09.748
that couldn't play the guitar,

29:09.791 --> 29:11.880
and that's what I became.

29:11.924 --> 29:14.753
So what did you do?

29:14.796 --> 29:16.145
Oh, I still can't
play the guitar.

29:17.016 --> 29:18.495
My brother can shred.

29:18.539 --> 29:21.803
At best, I'm, like,
the douchey guy

29:21.847 --> 29:24.023
playing the folk song
in the corner at the party.

29:24.066 --> 29:25.589
Hmm.

29:25.633 --> 29:27.766
But I'm trying to help you
avoid the error of my ways.

29:30.029 --> 29:34.163
Tell yourself a different story.

29:34.207 --> 29:35.730
You can shred, Maggie.

29:40.953 --> 29:42.606
What are you looking at?

29:45.174 --> 29:50.614
♪ Although it's just a simple

29:50.658 --> 29:53.617

that summons Elder Callahan.

30:26.781 --> 30:28.043
Stay back.

30:28.087 --> 30:30.524
The containment spell's
worn off.

30:39.141 --> 30:41.448
Time's up, witches.

30:50.065 --> 30:52.241
Hurry up,
I can't hold it for long.

30:52.285 --> 30:53.764
Once the full
moon rises,

30:53.808 --> 30:55.984
the Harbinger
will be unstoppable.

31:00.946 --> 31:02.948
Marisol saw this coming.

31:02.991 --> 31:04.340
She left this spell for them.

31:10.303 --> 31:11.608
She had the power
of prophecy,

31:11.652 --> 31:13.262
but her predictions
didn't always come true.

31:13.306 --> 31:16.178
Still, you know what it's like,
don't you, Charity?

31:16.222 --> 31:17.876
To break the rules
and follow your instincts.

31:19.660 --> 31:22.315
CHARITY:
We can't risk it.

31:25.448 --> 31:26.972
It will work.

31:27.015 --> 31:28.974
You don't have to
trust us.

31:29.017 --> 31:32.586
You knew our mother well;

31:32.629 --> 31:34.240
trust her.

32:13.496 --> 32:15.759
parar que inhabilite

Remueva la fuerza que tiene sobre éste inocente.

32:19.894 --> 32:21.548
Y Exorcize
al Heraldo,

32:21.591 --> 32:23.811
permitiendo que paz

32:37.738 --> 32:39.174
Is it working?I don't know.

32:39.218 --> 32:41.611
CHARITY: We've got to get
Angela to fight back.

32:43.396 --> 32:46.616
I-I'm an empath, maybe
I can try reaching her?

32:46.660 --> 32:47.835
Do it.

32:55.756 --> 32:57.888
El Poder de Tres lo compela!

32:57.932 --> 32:59.238
MAGGIE:
We're here to help you.

32:59.281 --> 33:02.676
ANGELA:
I'm scared.

33:02.719 --> 33:04.895
Whoa! You guys,
you guys, it worked!

33:04.939 --> 33:07.724
I sent her my thoughts and
she's in there. She heard me.

33:07.768 --> 33:10.162
Angela!

33:10.205 --> 33:13.556
MAGGIE: Angela, you've got
to fight back!

33:13.600 --> 33:16.516
ANGELA:
I can't do it. I can't.

33:16.559 --> 33:18.735
MAGGIE: Tell yourself
a different story, Angela.

33:18.779 --> 33:19.998
You're strong enough.

33:20.041 --> 33:22.522
You can do it.

33:30.008 --> 33:32.793
Observa, el Poder de Tres!

33:32.836 --> 33:36.057
Observa, el Poder de Tres!

33:36.101 --> 33:37.363
Observa, el Poder

33:37.406 --> 33:39.756
de Tres!

33:52.160 --> 33:53.988
TRIP:
Angela!

33:54.032 --> 33:55.729
Detective, stay back!

33:55.772 --> 33:57.252
Hands in the air! All of you!

34:14.487 --> 34:16.750
Angela!

34:16.793 --> 34:19.883
She's breathing.
She's breathing.

34:19.927 --> 34:22.277
MACY: Look, he's hurt.MAGGIE:
Oh, my God, Trip.

34:22.321 --> 34:24.888
What happened?

34:24.932 --> 34:27.891
Trip! He's not breathing.

34:27.935 --> 34:30.503
NIKO :
Trip, are you there? Copy.

34:30.546 --> 34:32.896
The police will be here
any minute. You should go.

34:32.940 --> 34:36.465
No, but Trip is dead.Mel, Mel,
I'll handle it.

34:36.509 --> 34:38.511
NIKO:
Trip, what's your 20?

34:43.733 --> 34:45.561
Do you copy

34:55.093 --> 34:57.269
What happened

34:57.312 --> 35:01.447
I dealt with
Officer Bailey's death

35:01.490 --> 35:03.927
in a way that wouldn't
raise suspicions.

35:03.971 --> 35:05.929
This is my fault.

35:05.973 --> 35:09.150
You told me to talk to Niko.
I could've kept him away.

35:09.194 --> 35:11.587
You couldn't have known
this would happen.

35:11.631 --> 35:15.330
It's the one part of the job
that doesn't get any easier.

35:15.374 --> 35:17.811
I've dealt with it,
your mother dealt with it,

35:17.854 --> 35:19.465
and, well, now you.

35:19.508 --> 35:20.596
Where's Angela?

35:20.640 --> 35:23.295
With my sisters. She's asleep.

35:23.338 --> 35:24.818
Again.

35:24.861 --> 35:27.429
Why don't you join them, hmm?

35:27.473 --> 35:28.952
I think you should
be there when the woman

35:28.996 --> 35:31.303
whose life you
saved wakes up.

35:33.479 --> 35:37.483
So, I came out
of my coma last week

35:37.526 --> 35:39.702
and just showed up
at your Halloween party?

35:41.704 --> 35:44.142
Why don't I remember anything?

35:44.185 --> 35:46.144
How did I
end up here?

35:48.015 --> 35:50.844
Blackouts can be
a pretty common occurrence

35:50.887 --> 35:52.411
among coma
survivors.

35:52.454 --> 35:55.544
Anything from fluorescent
lighting to alcohol consumption

35:55.588 --> 35:58.547
can prevent the hippocampus
from forming memories.

35:58.591 --> 36:00.984
I just remember
complete darkness.

36:01.028 --> 36:04.466
It was like I was
trying to get out,

36:04.510 --> 36:06.642
but nothing worked.

36:06.686 --> 36:09.341
And... then I heard a voice.

36:11.299 --> 36:14.868
It made me feel strong,
like I wasn't alone.

36:14.911 --> 36:18.959
You are not alone, Angela.
We are here for you.

36:19.002 --> 36:21.135
Yeah.

36:21.179 --> 36:23.093
I know.

36:23.137 --> 36:25.139
I can't believe I'm alive.

36:41.721 --> 36:44.724
you'd think with such frequent
visits from an Englishman,

36:44.767 --> 36:46.160
you could at least
stock your pantry

36:46.204 --> 36:48.118
with tea that isn't
absolute rubbish.

36:50.686 --> 36:54.864
But also, congratulations,
ladies. You did it.

36:54.908 --> 36:58.085
Angela's
still asleep.

36:58.128 --> 36:59.652
Where's Charity?

36:59.695 --> 37:02.350
She left with
the sacred vessel.

37:02.394 --> 37:04.222
The paint can.

37:04.265 --> 37:05.832
She'll store it somewhere safe.

37:05.875 --> 37:08.965
What's up with you
and Charity anyways?

37:09.009 --> 37:11.446
Sounds like you two have a past.

37:11.490 --> 37:14.275
I was born in 1920, so yes,
I have a past,

37:14.319 --> 37:16.016
and it's none of your business.

37:16.625 --> 37:19.280
Anyhow, despite
Charity's assistance,

37:19.324 --> 37:22.544
the Elders will be displeased
we disobeyed their orders.

37:22.588 --> 37:24.285
Even though we know now
they were wrong,

37:24.329 --> 37:25.504
they're still
the governing body,

37:25.547 --> 37:26.809
and there'll be consequences.

37:29.595 --> 37:32.772
But that's tomorrow's problem.

37:32.815 --> 37:35.601
Harry?

37:35.644 --> 37:38.168
Yes, Melanie.

37:38.212 --> 37:41.128
Congratulations
to you, too.

37:41.171 --> 37:43.173
You were
rad tonight.

That's great.

38:10.244 --> 38:12.638
And I've-I've asked for an
extension from Professor Brown.

38:12.681 --> 38:15.031
I need more time to prepare,

38:15.075 --> 38:17.817

I can do this on my own.

Oh.

Yeah, um...

38:27.043 --> 38:29.698
That kiss was a mistake.

One we can't make again.

You saved Angela.

39:11.174 --> 39:14.613
Mom would be proud.

39:14.656 --> 39:17.355
I haven't heard from Niko.

She must be crushed.

:
I can't believe it.

Mel, he's dead.

39:27.234 --> 39:29.758

at the warehouse.

39:37.940 --> 39:41.161

to the Halloween murders.

all those people.
