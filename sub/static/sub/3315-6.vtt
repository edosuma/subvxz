WEBVTT

00:31.517 --> 00:34.749
And since we are representing
a greedy‐ass corporation,

00:34.783 --> 00:37.022
we might want to think about
filing a peremptory challenge.

00:37.055 --> 00:38.759
Don't think about it.
Just...

00:38.793 --> 00:40.596
do it.

00:41.632 --> 00:43.401
How they were even a firm
before they hired me

00:43.435 --> 00:46.007
is a mystery that will haunt me
to the end of my days.

00:46.040 --> 00:47.877
Well, we agreed

00:47.911 --> 00:50.750
‐work was off‐limits, remember?
‐

00:50.783 --> 00:52.352
Hey, you don't see me
grading papers.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.825
I just want to make sure
that I don't...

00:54.858 --> 00:57.396
return to the shambles
of my case on Monday.

00:57.429 --> 01:02.540
And we're not technically
at the campsite yet, so...

01:02.574 --> 01:04.945
Well, just keep your eyes
on the road, please.

01:04.978 --> 01:06.648
You're gonna drive us
off a cliff before we even get

01:06.682 --> 01:08.519
our first mosquito bite.

01:08.552 --> 01:09.888
You know, you said you were
gonna be positive about this.

01:09.921 --> 01:11.725
I said that 'cause I love you.

01:11.758 --> 01:14.764
And we're not technically
at the campsite yet, remember?

01:14.798 --> 01:16.467
Mm.

01:16.502 --> 01:17.937
Uh, also,

01:17.971 --> 01:19.741
4,000 years of progress happened

01:19.774 --> 01:22.547
so we wouldn't have to sleep
in the woods.

01:22.580 --> 01:24.684
We're not just
"sleeping in the woods."

01:24.718 --> 01:27.891
This is about
experiencing nature,

01:27.924 --> 01:30.362
about getting outside
our comfort zones.

01:30.395 --> 01:31.765
Exactly.

01:31.798 --> 01:33.736
You know the word
for "outside your comfort zone"?

01:33.769 --> 01:36.007
"Uncomfortable."
Here you go, honey.

01:40.448 --> 01:42.620
Hey, honey,
can you not lick your fingers?

01:42.654 --> 01:44.791
Use the straw.

01:44.824 --> 01:47.530
‐
‐What do you say, buddy?

01:47.564 --> 01:48.632
You excited to go camping?

01:48.666 --> 01:49.801
I want TV.

01:50.870 --> 01:53.441
Wow.
Tough jury.

02:16.454 --> 02:17.790
How far back are we?

02:17.824 --> 02:20.563
Oh, right up next to the forest.

02:20.596 --> 02:24.036
Great. So we won't wake anyone
up during the bear attack.

02:43.809 --> 02:46.414
Now... just sit back

02:46.447 --> 02:48.752
and watch a master outdoorsman
at work.

02:54.029 --> 02:56.702
One, two, three.

02:58.539 --> 03:00.141
Can I see?

03:00.175 --> 03:01.578
One more time?

03:01.612 --> 03:02.714
Can I see
one more time?

03:02.747 --> 03:04.751
Oh, yeah, buddy. You see this?

03:04.784 --> 03:06.888
Oh, my gosh.
Daddy's making us a potty.

03:06.922 --> 03:08.124
He's making us a potty.

03:15.873 --> 03:17.577
More, more, more.

03:17.610 --> 03:19.648
Mm‐hmm, mm‐hmm, mm‐hmm.

03:19.681 --> 03:20.616
Yes.

03:20.650 --> 03:22.620
Mmm.

03:29.466 --> 03:30.569
You're feeling it, aren't you?

03:30.603 --> 03:32.205
The wine? Yes.

03:33.842 --> 03:35.947
For me, it starts
in the back of my neck.

03:35.980 --> 03:38.786
‐Mm.
‐When I actually let go
of all the bullshit

03:38.819 --> 03:42.459
and realize
I'm finally relaxing.

03:47.704 --> 03:49.774
I, uh...

03:49.808 --> 03:52.780
I think it might be
night‐night time.

03:52.814 --> 03:54.651
‐I think it's tent time.
‐Uh‐oh.

03:54.684 --> 03:56.588
Night‐night time!

03:56.621 --> 03:57.790
You ready, little guy?

03:57.824 --> 04:00.128
You ready... sweetheart?

04:00.161 --> 04:01.632
Oh.

04:01.665 --> 04:03.201
Let's give Daddy a kiss, okay?

04:03.234 --> 04:04.938
‐

04:04.971 --> 04:06.775
Mwah!

04:06.808 --> 04:11.785
Who wants to go
in the special sparkle cave?

04:11.818 --> 04:13.589
‐Go night‐night.
‐

04:13.622 --> 04:15.793
Ooh!

04:29.621 --> 04:30.856
He's so cute.

04:30.890 --> 04:32.192
Yeah.

04:33.662 --> 04:35.633
I'm officially glad we came.

04:35.666 --> 04:37.102
‐Mm.
‐Yeah?

04:37.135 --> 04:38.972
Yeah.

04:39.006 --> 04:42.079
I, um... I definitely think
we should come back.

04:42.112 --> 04:44.551
You know, in, like, ten years.

04:52.165 --> 04:53.769
What was that?

04:54.771 --> 04:56.975
It's just
something else to ignore

04:57.008 --> 04:58.946
while I rip your clothes off.

04:58.979 --> 05:01.618
Mm.

05:01.651 --> 05:03.589
‐
‐Mm.

05:07.630 --> 05:08.932
One, two, three.

05:08.966 --> 05:09.868
‐I think that's the...
‐

05:09.901 --> 05:10.970
Good morn...

05:11.003 --> 05:12.072
No one talk to me.

05:12.105 --> 05:15.211
Oh, God, I need caffeine.

05:15.245 --> 05:18.151
‐
‐You want this?
‐And it can swim upside down

05:18.184 --> 05:20.255
‐and stuff.
‐Ooh.

05:20.288 --> 05:22.059
Take this. Ah.

05:22.092 --> 05:23.595
Hey, bud.

05:23.629 --> 05:25.331
Can you hold
one more thing for me?

05:25.365 --> 05:28.204
This is my Boy Scout compass.

05:31.210 --> 05:32.613
You be careful?

05:32.647 --> 05:34.951
‐Sure.
‐All right.

05:34.984 --> 05:36.855
All right. Let's do it.

05:36.888 --> 05:38.257
Let's go.

05:39.761 --> 05:41.130
Do you like to hold it
like this?

05:41.163 --> 05:42.600
Or you want to hold it
like this?

05:42.633 --> 05:44.069
Oh.

05:45.940 --> 05:47.710
There you go.

05:51.752 --> 05:53.589
Hmm.

05:53.622 --> 05:54.858
Buddy?

05:54.891 --> 05:56.327
I don't know where he is.

05:56.360 --> 05:58.331
Buddy?

05:58.364 --> 06:01.103
‐Boo!
‐ Oh!

06:23.816 --> 06:25.251
Hmm.

06:25.285 --> 06:28.057
If my name were Jacob,
where would I be?

06:28.090 --> 06:29.994
I don't know.

06:30.028 --> 06:30.963
‐Boo!
‐Oh!

06:32.065 --> 06:33.836
That was a good one, bud.

06:33.869 --> 06:35.205
Hey.

06:35.238 --> 06:37.209
Don't run off too far.

06:57.282 --> 07:00.689
Jacob?

07:04.296 --> 07:05.298
Boo!

07:07.068 --> 07:08.972
Jacob?

07:09.006 --> 07:11.010
Jacob. Come on, buddy.

07:11.043 --> 07:12.345
What are you doing?

07:14.751 --> 07:16.020
Jacob?

07:16.053 --> 07:18.457
Jacob, come out right now!

07:18.491 --> 07:20.361
Jacob?!

07:20.395 --> 07:21.832
Jacob!

07:21.865 --> 07:23.702
Jacob?!

07:23.735 --> 07:25.305
Jacob!

07:26.173 --> 07:27.810
Jacob!

07:27.844 --> 07:30.783
‐Jay! Jay. Where's Jacob?
‐I can't find him.

07:30.816 --> 07:32.352
‐What?
‐I can't find him anywhere.

07:32.385 --> 07:34.189
He was here, we were playing,
and then he was gone.

07:34.223 --> 07:35.358
‐What are you talking about?
‐I can't find him anywhere.

07:35.391 --> 07:37.763
‐What? Jacob! Jacob!

07:37.797 --> 07:40.001
‐Jacob!
‐Jacob! Come on out!

07:40.034 --> 07:42.272
‐Jacob!
‐Come on out. It's okay.

07:42.305 --> 07:44.777
‐Jacob!
‐♪ ♪

07:44.811 --> 07:46.815
Jacob! Jacob!

07:46.848 --> 07:48.952
Jacob?

07:48.986 --> 07:50.455
Jacob!

09:29.286 --> 09:30.421
Gantz?

09:30.455 --> 09:32.158
That's me.

09:32.192 --> 09:33.895
Bob Birch. We need to talk.

09:33.929 --> 09:36.066
And you need to fuck off.

09:36.100 --> 09:38.070
Tell Zeigler he can kiss my ass.

09:38.104 --> 09:39.974
I'm staying
until my lease is up.

09:40.008 --> 09:40.976
Ho‐Hold on, hold on.

09:42.245 --> 09:44.383
I don't know
what you're talking about.

09:44.416 --> 09:47.957
I'm here because I have
information about your son.

09:56.541 --> 09:59.580
Guess some tenants found out
who I am and don't want a guy

09:59.614 --> 10:02.520
who maybe killed his kid
living in the building.

10:02.553 --> 10:04.423
‐
‐They slash my tires,

10:04.456 --> 10:07.062
leave messages on my phone,

10:07.095 --> 10:08.565
slip love letters
under the door.

10:08.598 --> 10:10.201
Only reason
you're standing here is

10:10.234 --> 10:12.472
you don't look like a reporter.

10:12.506 --> 10:14.242
I'm a hunter.

10:16.146 --> 10:17.850
I lead tours up in the woods.

10:17.883 --> 10:21.023
Mostly bankers
trying to find their balls.

10:21.056 --> 10:22.626
They shoot a bear,

10:22.660 --> 10:25.064
go home feeling like Iron Man

10:25.098 --> 10:27.001
and continue fucking people
over.

10:28.371 --> 10:29.574
You must be proud of yourself.

10:35.619 --> 10:37.088
Don't you want to know
why I'm here?

10:38.290 --> 10:40.929
Guess I'm just putting off
the disappointment.

10:40.963 --> 10:43.869
You're about the 200th person
who's come about my son.

10:43.902 --> 10:45.238
I talk to all of 'em.

10:45.271 --> 10:48.210
Psychics. Amateur detectives.

10:48.244 --> 10:50.616
Plain crazy.

10:50.649 --> 10:52.285
Which category you fall into?

10:52.318 --> 10:54.156
‐Eyewitness.
‐

10:56.928 --> 10:59.567
Every spring, I hang
camera traps around the park.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.538
Keep track of game.

11:02.940 --> 11:04.009
What's this?

11:04.042 --> 11:05.913
This photo was taken last week,

11:05.946 --> 11:07.115
in the deep back.

11:07.148 --> 11:09.386
Ain't no campgrounds or trails

11:09.419 --> 11:11.290
around there for miles.

11:14.463 --> 11:16.066
What the fuck
are you trying to tell me?

11:16.100 --> 11:18.003
When he disappeared,
your son was carrying

11:18.037 --> 11:20.509
an old Boy Scout compass,
ain't that right?

11:20.542 --> 11:22.112
Well, I found this

11:22.145 --> 11:25.418
where the camera trap photo
was taken.

11:41.551 --> 11:43.354
‐Who are you?
‐I told you.

11:43.387 --> 11:44.524
I'm a hunter.

11:44.557 --> 11:46.995
Look at the photo.

11:47.028 --> 11:50.602
That boy is about the same age
your son would be right now.

11:52.372 --> 11:54.510
You think that's a coincidence?

11:56.548 --> 11:58.250
You said my son was taken.

11:58.284 --> 11:59.720
Mm.

11:59.754 --> 12:01.457
The past 15 years,

12:01.490 --> 12:04.129
that whole area of the park's
been overrun

12:04.162 --> 12:06.099
by illegal pot farms.

12:08.170 --> 12:09.540
Pot farms?

12:09.574 --> 12:11.243
These are bad folks,

12:11.276 --> 12:13.280
some tied to the cartels.

12:15.251 --> 12:17.155
And you're saying
these people took my son?

12:17.188 --> 12:18.758
It ain't exactly news

12:18.792 --> 12:22.298
that the cartels use kidnapping
to get what they want.

12:22.332 --> 12:24.202
And some of these...

12:24.236 --> 12:26.273
people...

12:27.510 --> 12:29.947
...they're tied to trafficking.

12:31.016 --> 12:32.720
Now, hold on.

12:32.753 --> 12:36.426
All I know is that that photo
was snapped where they operate.

12:36.460 --> 12:39.767
Now, I'm offering
to take you there,

12:39.800 --> 12:41.436
find out if I'm right.

12:41.470 --> 12:43.440
Why?

12:43.474 --> 12:45.077
What do you want?

12:45.111 --> 12:46.548
Expenses.

12:46.581 --> 12:48.350
Nothing more.

12:51.056 --> 12:53.160
The growers,
on the other hand...

12:54.530 --> 12:56.668
...that's a different
conversation.

13:02.378 --> 13:04.216
I know how it sounds,

13:04.249 --> 13:06.253
but the man
isn't even asking for money.

13:08.123 --> 13:11.698
No. He just wants $10,000
for one of these drug people.

13:11.731 --> 13:13.234
He has a contact
with the growers.

13:13.267 --> 13:15.606
He thinks if we pay him,
he may open up

13:15.639 --> 13:16.808
and tell us what he knows.

13:16.841 --> 13:18.277
It's a scam, Jay.

13:18.310 --> 13:19.614
It...

13:19.647 --> 13:21.283
It's so obviously a scam.

13:21.316 --> 13:23.454
I can't believe
you came all the way down here

13:23.487 --> 13:25.091
to put me through this again.

13:25.124 --> 13:26.828
'Kay, will you
at least look at the photo?

13:26.861 --> 13:28.632
No, I will not look at the...

13:30.101 --> 13:33.575
I cannot keep having my heart
ripped out over

13:33.608 --> 13:36.614
and over and over.

13:36.648 --> 13:38.652
Every time we think
there's a chance,

13:38.685 --> 13:41.658
every time,
it turns out to be nothing.

13:41.691 --> 13:43.360
Please just let me live my life.

13:43.394 --> 13:45.431
You call this a life?

13:45.464 --> 13:46.701
Selling these boxes?

13:46.734 --> 13:48.805
Well, I can't teach,

13:48.838 --> 13:51.611
so I have to do something.
I do this.

13:51.644 --> 13:53.314
You need to find something.

13:53.347 --> 13:55.184
‐
‐I need to find our son.

13:55.217 --> 13:56.521
He's gone, Jay!

13:56.554 --> 13:58.658
He's gone.
He‐he got lost...

13:58.692 --> 14:00.829
and drowned or froze to death

14:00.862 --> 14:02.600
or an animal ate him.

14:08.143 --> 14:11.517
Maybe it's a scam
and maybe I'm an idiot, but I...

14:11.551 --> 14:13.655
can't ignore this.

14:13.688 --> 14:16.828
And I don't have the money,
Addy. I...

14:16.861 --> 14:18.598
‐I need your help.
‐

14:19.700 --> 14:22.438
Goddamn you, Jay.

14:22.472 --> 14:24.376
Goddamn you.

14:41.744 --> 14:44.149
Let me show you something, boss.

14:52.700 --> 14:55.204
It's known as the Malvados.

14:55.237 --> 14:57.543
It's where the trail cam photo
was snapped.

14:57.576 --> 15:00.682
It's a good ten klicks
from here, mostly off trail.

15:00.716 --> 15:03.387
Need to be at the growers' camp
before sunset

15:03.420 --> 15:04.924
or we're in the shit.

15:04.957 --> 15:06.561
Let's go.

15:21.691 --> 15:24.396
What's Rob think
of all this?

15:25.599 --> 15:27.636
Uh, we split up. So, actually,
if you really want to know,

15:27.670 --> 15:29.172
it's none of your business, Jay.

15:29.205 --> 15:30.842
Okay. I just, uh...

15:30.876 --> 15:34.182
Haven't seen you in a year
and wanted to catch up.

15:37.723 --> 15:40.562
He wanted to start a family.
That's what happened.

15:40.595 --> 15:43.267
Oh.

15:43.300 --> 15:44.937
I'm... old‐fashioned.

15:44.970 --> 15:47.275
I believe in one family
per lifetime,

15:47.308 --> 15:49.212
and I already had mine.

15:49.245 --> 15:50.615
Maybe that was our mistake.

15:50.649 --> 15:51.951
We should have tried
for another.

15:51.984 --> 15:53.588
You talk like I didn't want to,

15:53.621 --> 15:55.391
like I'm the one
who asked for the divorce.

15:55.424 --> 15:56.894
You didn't have to ask.

15:56.928 --> 15:58.531
It was in every look,

15:58.565 --> 16:00.401
every word you said,

16:00.434 --> 16:01.871
every word you didn't say,

16:01.904 --> 16:04.342
wanting it to be my fault.

16:07.014 --> 16:09.920
I never blamed you, Jay, ever.

16:09.954 --> 16:11.958
Not once. You just...

16:11.991 --> 16:13.795
You needed to believe I did.

16:13.828 --> 16:15.665
You needed to sink
into your little pit of hell

16:15.699 --> 16:17.468
and‐and punish yourself.

16:17.503 --> 16:19.239
And where you went, there
wasn't room for anyone else.

16:19.272 --> 16:20.976
Do you think
I wanted the last ten years?

16:21.009 --> 16:22.746
‐Well, you surely didn't want
anything else!
‐Hey. Hey.

16:23.748 --> 16:25.418
This ain't
no fucking marriage retreat,

16:25.451 --> 16:27.422
and I sure as hell
ain't Dr. Phil.

16:27.455 --> 16:30.529
You can work out
your shit later.

16:30.562 --> 16:33.233
We need to keep moving.
Come on, buddy. Come on.

16:35.304 --> 16:36.607
Great plan, Jay.

16:57.297 --> 16:59.201
We're coming up
on the ranger station.

16:59.235 --> 17:01.874
Guy who runs this here's
a couple rounds shy of a clip.

17:01.907 --> 17:04.412
Not so much a park ranger
as some kind of weird,

17:04.446 --> 17:06.315
fucked‐up Boy Scout.

17:06.349 --> 17:08.521
If possible, avoid conversation.

17:09.623 --> 17:11.927
We can fill up here.

17:11.960 --> 17:14.933
Come on. We got to check in
or he'll get squirrelly.

17:17.472 --> 17:19.241
‐Thanks.
‐Awesome.

17:19.275 --> 17:21.547
Thanks. Guess I'm the, uh...

17:21.580 --> 17:23.149
water girl.

17:37.746 --> 17:39.616
Goddamn. We're in luck.

17:42.989 --> 17:44.659
What?

17:46.563 --> 17:47.932
Nothing.

17:56.750 --> 17:58.888
G'day.

17:58.921 --> 18:00.591
Where you folks headed?

18:02.327 --> 18:04.499
We're just, you know...
just hiking the trails.

18:04.533 --> 18:07.404
Me and my...

18:07.439 --> 18:09.241
You know,
just getting out of the city.

18:11.513 --> 18:14.519
Just hiking the trail,
huh, Birch?

18:14.553 --> 18:17.592
Yeah. Just running
another tour, Stan.

18:21.800 --> 18:22.936
Take 'em down the valley.

18:22.969 --> 18:24.840
If there's time,
go see the falls.

18:24.873 --> 18:26.977
The valley.

18:27.010 --> 18:29.315
Falls.

18:29.348 --> 18:30.651
Bullshit.

18:30.685 --> 18:32.622
Am I right?

18:32.655 --> 18:34.291
Yeah.

18:34.325 --> 18:35.995
‐You're right.
‐Mm‐hmm.

18:38.768 --> 18:40.505
We're here to find our son.

18:43.477 --> 18:45.448
‐Your son.
‐Yep.

18:45.481 --> 18:46.650
You know who we are, don't you?

18:46.683 --> 18:48.554
Recognize you from the news.

18:48.587 --> 18:50.458
Well, we have reason to believe
that our son's still alive.

18:50.491 --> 18:51.794
We're headed up
into those hills.

18:51.827 --> 18:52.862
Malvados.

18:52.896 --> 18:54.734
Jesus Christ, Birch.

18:54.768 --> 18:56.805
What are you telling
these people?

18:56.838 --> 18:59.276
Look, the Malvados
is nowhere you want to go.

18:59.310 --> 19:00.646
We know about the growers.

19:00.680 --> 19:03.419
I'm not talking
about the growers.

19:03.452 --> 19:04.788
There are things
in those canyons

19:04.821 --> 19:06.458
a million times worse
than the growers.

19:06.491 --> 19:08.227
What?

19:08.261 --> 19:09.764
What's in the canyons?

19:09.798 --> 19:11.435
This is what I was afraid of.

19:11.468 --> 19:13.237
We don't have to listen to this.
Let's go.

19:13.271 --> 19:14.708
No, I'm sorry.

19:14.741 --> 19:16.311
I want to hear.
I want to hear this.

19:16.345 --> 19:18.582
There's nothing to hear, honey.

19:18.615 --> 19:20.386
It's a bunch of bullshit.

19:21.922 --> 19:23.859
Hey, boss.

19:23.892 --> 19:25.463
Let's not do this.

19:25.496 --> 19:26.865
I was here, in this station,

19:26.898 --> 19:28.635
the day your son went missing.

19:28.669 --> 19:29.904
You were?

19:31.675 --> 19:34.213
I'd only been in the country
a couple of months.

19:34.246 --> 19:36.818
Didn't know
if I wanted to stay, but...

19:36.852 --> 19:38.889
after that night,

19:38.922 --> 19:40.593
I knew I could never leave.

19:40.626 --> 19:42.630
The helicopters,
the search parties‐‐

19:42.663 --> 19:45.302
they were everywhere. Thought
it might have been a bear

19:45.336 --> 19:46.838
spooked by the commotion.

19:46.872 --> 19:48.241
But then I saw differently.

19:48.274 --> 19:49.744
I asked myself,

19:49.778 --> 19:50.980
who or what was walking
around my ranger station

19:51.013 --> 19:52.884
with feet like that?

19:57.994 --> 19:59.297
Well...

20:00.800 --> 20:02.437
...I got part of an answer.

20:02.470 --> 20:04.273
‐
‐Wait.

20:04.307 --> 20:05.810
So you're saying...

20:05.843 --> 20:07.980
whatever this thing was,
it was...

20:08.014 --> 20:10.352
was carrying our son?

20:10.386 --> 20:13.859
Well, I can't legally say
what it is that I saw

20:13.892 --> 20:15.763
or what it was carrying, but...

20:15.796 --> 20:16.965
I know I saw something.

20:16.998 --> 20:18.335
Something you don't want
to mess with.

20:18.368 --> 20:19.738
Yeah. Well,
thank you for telling us

20:19.771 --> 20:21.408
what you legally can't say,

20:21.441 --> 20:23.712
but I think we've heard enough.

20:23.746 --> 20:25.783
We should get going.

20:25.816 --> 20:28.555
Addy, we can't buy into this.

20:28.589 --> 20:30.760
‐Your husband's right.
‐He's not my husband anymore.

20:30.793 --> 20:32.964
I don't care.

20:32.997 --> 20:34.601
We are racing the night.

20:34.634 --> 20:36.438
We either move right now

20:36.471 --> 20:37.907
or we go back the way we came.

20:37.940 --> 20:38.976
You understand?

20:41.615 --> 20:42.750
STAN
Be smart.

20:42.784 --> 20:44.988
Go back the way you came.

20:48.695 --> 20:50.031
Told you that Aussie's crazy.

20:50.064 --> 20:51.768
He has no reason to lie to us.

20:51.802 --> 20:53.338
I'm not saying he's lying.
I'm saying his Wheaties

20:53.372 --> 20:55.041
have been in the milk too long.

20:55.074 --> 20:58.482
So, what, the story he told us,
you... think he imagined it?

20:58.515 --> 21:00.286
What do you think?

21:00.319 --> 21:02.623
Uh, I think
a lot of weird stuff happened

21:02.657 --> 21:03.826
the night my son went missing.

21:03.859 --> 21:05.896
Stuff no one ever wanted
to talk about.

21:05.930 --> 21:09.671
Like the deer I found hanging
from the tree.

21:09.704 --> 21:11.374
Deer?

21:11.408 --> 21:13.312
It was cut open,
stuck from a tree.

21:13.345 --> 21:14.881
Ooh.

21:14.914 --> 21:16.485
It looked like
some kind of sign.

21:16.518 --> 21:17.820
And then those sounds
we heard...

21:17.854 --> 21:18.822
Goddamn it. Look.

21:18.856 --> 21:20.024
I have been hunting

21:20.058 --> 21:22.597
these woods for 20 years,

21:22.630 --> 21:25.769
and I've never seen nothin'
that I couldn't explain.

21:25.803 --> 21:27.640
I never heard anyone else talk

21:27.673 --> 21:29.911
about something
they couldn't explain except

21:29.944 --> 21:32.750
for Ranger fuckin'
Crocodile Hunter back there.

21:33.986 --> 21:35.689
You believe him, honey,

21:35.723 --> 21:37.894
you're just as fucking crazy
as he is.

21:37.927 --> 21:39.464
Hey, don't talk to her
like that.

21:39.497 --> 21:41.066
‐It's okay, Jay.
‐No, no, no.

21:42.803 --> 21:45.309
Don't fucking talk to her
like that.

22:51.808 --> 22:53.579
Hold on.

22:55.783 --> 22:56.818
Oh, my God.

22:57.853 --> 22:59.857
Jesus fucking Christ.

23:00.926 --> 23:02.763
‐
‐Birch, what the fuck

23:02.797 --> 23:04.701
‐happened here?
‐

23:04.734 --> 23:06.605
Just give me a second.
Just shut the fuck up!

23:08.140 --> 23:11.046
What in the holy fuck
happened here?

23:12.583 --> 23:14.754
It's got to be the cartel
or a rival cartel.

23:14.787 --> 23:17.192
These people are always killing
each other.

23:17.225 --> 23:19.931
That's got to be...
what it is.

23:19.964 --> 23:21.534
Okay, so...

23:21.568 --> 23:23.004
‐Jay. Jay.
‐...what do we do?

23:24.172 --> 23:25.676
I'm thinkin'.

23:25.709 --> 23:27.947
Well, is there any, um...

23:27.980 --> 23:29.784
is there anyone else...

23:29.817 --> 23:31.688
anyone else who could help us?

23:37.900 --> 23:39.871
Help us?

23:39.904 --> 23:42.610
Yeah, find out about our son.

23:42.643 --> 23:43.845
Your son?

23:43.879 --> 23:45.649
Yes. Our son!

23:45.683 --> 23:47.118
The whole reason we're here!

23:50.158 --> 23:51.661
Where's our fucking son, Birch?

23:52.697 --> 23:53.765
People,

23:53.799 --> 23:55.836
I don't have the first clue

23:55.869 --> 23:57.038
where your son is. Never did.

23:57.072 --> 23:58.842
And that photo I showed you‐‐

23:58.875 --> 23:59.877
that was my nephew.

23:59.911 --> 24:01.915
I shot that in the backyard.

24:01.948 --> 24:04.186
‐
‐And the‐the compass,

24:04.219 --> 24:06.156
I bought that
at the Salvation Army store

24:06.190 --> 24:08.094
and dirtied it up.

24:08.127 --> 24:10.198
Yeah, you wanted our money.

24:10.231 --> 24:13.037
I needed that fucking money.

24:14.774 --> 24:16.778
And so I made a deal
with these...

24:16.811 --> 24:18.649
poor fucks.

24:18.682 --> 24:21.921
I get the ten grand, and
then they make you disappear.

24:21.955 --> 24:24.927
And then, in return,
they get your credit cards

24:24.961 --> 24:28.100
and your ATM cards
and then I go back and I say

24:28.134 --> 24:31.040
we got separated
and‐and then I lost you.

24:31.073 --> 24:32.910
And everybody,
everybody makes out!

24:32.943 --> 24:34.714
‐You son of a...
‐Jay!

24:36.985 --> 24:39.457
I have to do this.

24:40.224 --> 24:42.128
I don't want to do this.

24:42.162 --> 24:45.034
But I can't just let you walk
out of here.

24:46.003 --> 24:47.238
Down on your knees.

24:47.272 --> 24:49.677
‐Fuck you.
‐Get on your knees!

24:49.711 --> 24:51.113
No. No.

24:52.983 --> 24:54.654
Fine.

24:55.756 --> 24:57.560
Have it your way.

24:59.062 --> 25:02.903
I told you I was gonna reunite
you with your boy.

25:04.039 --> 25:05.776
And now you're gonna see him.

25:07.680 --> 25:09.517
‐
‐Oh, shit.

25:09.550 --> 25:11.554
‐

25:13.325 --> 25:14.560
Come on, come on. Get up.

25:14.594 --> 25:15.662
You can get up. Come on.

25:33.331 --> 25:35.234
‐

25:36.738 --> 25:38.040
Come on, you.

25:38.074 --> 25:39.209
Keep going. Come on.

25:39.242 --> 25:40.779
‐Jesus Christ.
‐Come on, Jay.

25:41.681 --> 25:43.552
‐
‐The hell happened to you?

25:43.585 --> 25:44.454
He's been shot.

25:48.227 --> 25:50.098
‐Okay, hold on.
‐Sure, sure. Okay.

25:50.131 --> 25:52.001
‐Okay.

25:52.035 --> 25:53.672
Hey. Yeah, right here.

25:53.705 --> 25:54.907
Where the hell's Birch?

25:54.941 --> 25:56.678
‐Birch is dead.
‐

25:57.680 --> 25:59.751
‐Well, saw that coming.
‐Um, careful.

25:59.784 --> 26:02.289
‐
‐Yikes.

26:02.323 --> 26:04.159
‐At least it's through
and through.
‐What?

26:04.192 --> 26:06.297
‐Would you please just help
my husband?
‐

26:06.331 --> 26:07.767
It's basically a scratch.

26:11.307 --> 26:13.210
Crack on, then.

26:13.244 --> 26:14.781
Tell me everything
that happened.

26:14.814 --> 26:16.016
‐
‐Oh, Jesus.

26:16.049 --> 26:17.887
I'm gonna throw up.
I feel sick.

26:17.920 --> 26:19.189
Do that later, please.

26:19.222 --> 26:21.294
Right now,
I need to know everything.

26:21.327 --> 26:23.130
We, um...
we went to the place where...

26:23.164 --> 26:24.901
uh, where Birch said
the drug people were.

26:24.934 --> 26:26.170
And‐and, when we got there,

26:26.203 --> 26:27.640
they were all dead.

26:27.673 --> 26:29.377
Every one of 'em...

26:29.410 --> 26:30.913
was ripped apart.

26:30.946 --> 26:32.650
As if by an animal.

26:32.683 --> 26:35.254
And he said he was, um,
he was lying to us about our son

26:35.289 --> 26:36.891
and that he‐he was...

26:36.925 --> 26:38.260
...he was trying
to scam us out of our money.

26:38.295 --> 26:39.363
‐Keep going.
‐He was gonna kill us.

26:39.397 --> 26:41.166
‐Shoot us.
‐Prick.

26:41.200 --> 26:44.005
One of the bodies, it...

26:44.039 --> 26:45.809
it wasn't dead.
It‐it, uh...

26:45.843 --> 26:47.713
it attacked Birch. It...

26:49.282 --> 26:51.621
‐It bit his neck.
‐

26:52.823 --> 26:54.192
All right, folks.

26:56.364 --> 26:57.766
Do you know
if they followed you?

26:57.800 --> 26:59.303
I don't think so.
I don't think so.

26:59.337 --> 27:00.772
I think the gun scared 'em off.

27:00.806 --> 27:02.041
If they didn't come after you,

27:02.075 --> 27:04.012
it wasn't 'cause you had a gun.

27:04.045 --> 27:05.649
Keep pressure on that.

27:07.686 --> 27:09.757
What is out there?

27:09.790 --> 27:10.759
What are those things?

27:12.730 --> 27:14.800
‐

27:14.834 --> 27:17.071
Looks quiet.

27:17.105 --> 27:18.308
I don't think they're coming.

27:18.341 --> 27:19.744
Who's coming?

27:19.777 --> 27:21.013
And don't say fucking Bigfoot,

27:21.046 --> 27:22.282
because that wasn't any Bigfoot

27:22.316 --> 27:24.720
that ripped out Birch's throat.

27:24.754 --> 27:27.192
‐
‐You're better off not knowing.

27:28.461 --> 27:30.966
Can't tell you
even if I wanted to.

27:30.999 --> 27:32.403
Not allowed.

27:32.436 --> 27:33.872
Not allowed?

27:33.905 --> 27:35.141
Those are the rules.

27:35.174 --> 27:37.913
‐Rules?
‐What are you, a fucking parrot?

27:37.947 --> 27:40.117
Hey, man.
Fuck you and your rules.

27:40.151 --> 27:42.289
‐Jesus Christ.
‐Okay, Jay...
‐Get his shotgun.

27:42.323 --> 27:43.825
‐What? I...
‐Just go take his gun.

27:43.859 --> 27:46.297
‐Take it from him.
‐

27:46.331 --> 27:48.100
I don't know how many bullets
are left in this gun,

27:48.133 --> 27:51.741
but, I swear, I will pump you
full of 'em to find out.

27:54.714 --> 27:56.684
Give her the gun.

27:58.788 --> 28:01.828
‐You ever held a gun before?
‐

28:03.865 --> 28:06.738
We've been lied to a lot today,
Mr. Ranger,

28:06.771 --> 28:09.009
but, I swear,
somebody will tell us the truth

28:09.042 --> 28:10.345
before the sun comes up.

28:10.379 --> 28:12.115
I want to know everything

28:12.148 --> 28:14.085
you say you can't tell us.

28:17.225 --> 28:18.995
Fine.

28:22.903 --> 28:24.874
They're not Bigfoot.

28:24.907 --> 28:28.113
Bigfoot is a fairy tale
compared to these things.

28:28.147 --> 28:30.017
In my country,
they call it the yowie,

28:30.051 --> 28:32.021
but that's bullshit, too.

28:32.990 --> 28:34.493
Uh...

28:34.527 --> 28:36.364
You really want
to know everything,

28:36.397 --> 28:38.133
I need to open that.

28:39.870 --> 28:41.774
Go ahead.

28:49.089 --> 28:50.859
‐

28:50.892 --> 28:52.796
Believe me when I tell you,

28:52.830 --> 28:54.199
I was only brought onto this
two years

28:54.232 --> 28:55.936
after your son went missing.

28:55.969 --> 28:58.842
It's a little slice of
American history that's guarded,

28:58.875 --> 29:00.779
like the Manhattan Project.

29:01.948 --> 29:03.250
And that's this.

29:04.353 --> 29:07.293
Your national park system

29:07.326 --> 29:10.164
wasn't created to preserve
the country's natural beauty.

29:13.203 --> 29:14.840
What was it created for?

29:16.444 --> 29:19.517
To keep Americans from things
that would kill and eat 'em.

29:22.523 --> 29:24.360
‐
‐Go on.

29:24.393 --> 29:25.395
Take a look.

29:30.872 --> 29:32.576
I call them Feral Nation.

29:32.609 --> 29:34.780
They're a subpopulation
of humans that live

29:34.814 --> 29:37.185
in the deep woods, like animals.

29:37.218 --> 29:38.521
History and old newspaper articles,

29:38.555 --> 29:40.459
they were known as wild men.

29:40.492 --> 29:43.097
That was grafted
onto the Bigfoot myth.

29:43.130 --> 29:45.234
Lot of Bigfoot sightings
are these things.

29:45.267 --> 29:47.171
You said "eat them."

29:47.205 --> 29:49.142
These things... eat people?

29:49.175 --> 29:51.246
Yeah, whenever they can,
they go cannibal.

29:52.449 --> 29:54.453
Okay, why are...

29:54.487 --> 29:55.822
why do they look like this?

29:56.624 --> 29:57.993
Inbreeding.

29:58.027 --> 29:59.397
Genetic mutations over decades,

29:59.430 --> 30:01.868
‐maybe hundreds of years.
‐I don't understand.

30:01.901 --> 30:03.203
Why did you lie to us?
Why did you say

30:03.237 --> 30:04.306
it was Bigfoot?

30:04.340 --> 30:06.076
I never said Bigfoot. You did.

30:06.109 --> 30:08.213
‐But you did say
hundreds of years.
‐

30:10.217 --> 30:11.554
Well, some think
the ferals have been here

30:11.587 --> 30:13.525
since the Vikings landed
in Newfoundland.

30:16.196 --> 30:18.435
I think
that's pretty farfetched.

30:19.403 --> 30:21.841
If you ask me,
I think they're descendants

30:21.874 --> 30:23.545
of the old mountain men
who never came down out

30:23.578 --> 30:25.882
of the mountains.

30:25.916 --> 30:27.486
Or maybe they're
Civil War soldiers

30:27.519 --> 30:30.091
who never surrendered
after the war.

30:30.124 --> 30:33.431
Hell, maybe they're just
normal people who checked out,

30:33.465 --> 30:35.435
had enough of the world.

30:36.404 --> 30:39.310
There are pockets of these
things in every national park.

30:39.343 --> 30:43.150
Over 2,000 people have vanished
from the parks over the years.

30:43.183 --> 30:46.858
The‐the government
just knows all about this

30:46.891 --> 30:48.428
and‐and keeps it a secret?

30:48.461 --> 30:51.199
Oh. Governments need
their citizens to believe

30:51.233 --> 30:52.970
they're in control.

30:53.003 --> 30:54.507
Plus, the national parks
generate billions of dollars

30:54.540 --> 30:56.276
in revenue every year.

30:56.310 --> 30:58.147
It's capitalism, baby.

30:58.180 --> 31:00.017
I mean, if people knew
there were feral cannibals

31:00.051 --> 31:02.322
running around,
attendance might drop off.

31:03.425 --> 31:05.595
Instead, the government
chooses containment.

31:06.697 --> 31:08.401
Containment.

31:11.039 --> 31:12.409
The day your son went missing,

31:12.443 --> 31:14.847
you notice anything weird
about the search teams?

31:16.317 --> 31:18.020
Yeah.

31:19.590 --> 31:21.093
When the police
were searching the woods,

31:21.126 --> 31:22.563
there was a group of soldiers.

31:22.596 --> 31:25.569
They told us
that it was an Army Ranger unit

31:25.602 --> 31:27.973
attached to
the California National Guard.

31:28.006 --> 31:29.610
Yeah, they were supposed
to be helping with the search,

31:29.643 --> 31:32.014
but they went into the woods
and never came out.

31:32.048 --> 31:33.618
It was like they were running
their own operation.

31:33.651 --> 31:34.920
They were.

31:34.954 --> 31:37.926
And it wasn't to find your son.

31:37.960 --> 31:39.697
Whenever there's an incident,
these units are called in

31:39.730 --> 31:41.501
for population control.

31:41.534 --> 31:45.040
Find and kill as many
of the ferals as possible.

31:45.074 --> 31:46.377
Those soldiers
weren't on a rescue mission‐‐

31:46.410 --> 31:47.379
they were on a hunt.

31:47.412 --> 31:50.552
This is crazy. I...

31:50.585 --> 31:52.556
‐
‐I can't believe this.

31:52.589 --> 31:55.027
I was on one of those sweeps.

31:55.060 --> 31:57.031
Was there 'cause I was familiar
with the area.

31:57.064 --> 32:00.171
So I can personally tell you
they happened.

32:00.204 --> 32:02.976
Though they didn't always go
according to plan.

32:04.012 --> 32:05.382
Soldiers can be cocky bastards.

32:05.415 --> 32:07.084
Sometimes they'd forget
they weren't

32:07.118 --> 32:08.588
‐dealing with animals.
‐

32:08.621 --> 32:09.523
They were dealing
with something else.

32:09.557 --> 32:10.659
Go, go!

32:11.761 --> 32:19.042
‐

32:21.981 --> 32:24.018
‐

32:25.722 --> 32:28.160
Not everyone in those sweeps
came back alive.

32:28.193 --> 32:30.030
But, for the most part,

32:30.064 --> 32:32.436
we gave 'em more than we got.

32:32.469 --> 32:35.141
Okay, so you're saying
that our son,

32:35.174 --> 32:38.481
he was taken by these things,
and they...

32:38.515 --> 32:40.352
If it's any consolation,
the things responsible

32:40.385 --> 32:41.621
didn't make it through the day.

32:44.125 --> 32:46.364
Oh, boy.

32:48.735 --> 32:50.972
Can I have my gun back now,
please?

32:52.709 --> 32:54.212
Oh.

32:54.245 --> 32:55.515
Yeah.

32:55.549 --> 32:57.151
Sorry.

33:03.598 --> 33:05.435
All right,
I'm gonna get on the GMR,

33:05.468 --> 33:07.171
get someone out here
to take you to a hospital.

33:07.205 --> 33:09.376
‐GMR?
‐The radio.

33:09.410 --> 33:11.046
These things are moving

33:11.079 --> 33:13.785
into areas
they're not supposed to be.

33:13.818 --> 33:16.290
And now you're telling me
about this massacre.

33:16.324 --> 33:19.262
Sure, I mean, maybe it's the
growers that have 'em riled up.

33:19.296 --> 33:20.599
Or the drought.

33:20.632 --> 33:22.369
Maybe it's two grieving parents

33:22.402 --> 33:25.342
walking into their territory
with a moron. But...

33:25.375 --> 33:27.078
whatever it is,

33:27.111 --> 33:29.350
it's my fucking duty
to call in for another sweep.

33:29.383 --> 33:30.685
Oh. By the way...

33:32.188 --> 33:34.527
...try and go public
with this and I'll deny it.

33:34.560 --> 33:36.464
People will believe me.

33:37.466 --> 33:40.137
Everyone trusts a park ranger.

33:54.767 --> 33:57.442
KC Region 12
to INF Forest North. Come in.

34:00.982 --> 34:02.552
You were right.

34:02.586 --> 34:05.959
And I was wrong. Again.

34:05.992 --> 34:08.131
‐I almost got us killed.
‐

34:08.164 --> 34:10.535
Brought this all back around.

34:12.339 --> 34:14.476
Well...

34:14.510 --> 34:17.215
...at least we know
what happened.

34:17.249 --> 34:19.953
Would have been better
not to know.

34:21.524 --> 34:24.296
I'm sorry for everything.

34:24.329 --> 34:26.032
For Jacob,

34:26.066 --> 34:28.036
this,

34:28.070 --> 34:30.642
pushing you away.

34:30.675 --> 34:32.078
I wanted you to blame me.

34:32.112 --> 34:34.283
I wanted to... punish myself,

34:34.316 --> 34:36.187
so I destroyed

34:36.220 --> 34:38.191
the best thing I ever had.

34:38.224 --> 34:40.027
Us.

34:42.132 --> 34:45.305
KC Region 12
to INF Forest North. Come in.

34:45.338 --> 34:48.177
This is Forest North.
Go ahead, KC.

34:48.211 --> 34:50.548
‐Forest North,
we got a situation here.
‐

34:50.582 --> 34:52.419
We're gonna need a...

35:01.203 --> 35:03.174
‐Jay.
‐

35:05.278 --> 35:06.514
‐

35:06.547 --> 35:08.083
‐Oh, my God! Jay.
‐Fuck!

35:09.153 --> 35:10.588
Stay back!

35:13.026 --> 35:14.563
‐

35:18.171 --> 35:19.106
‐
‐What the fuck?

35:24.149 --> 35:25.985
Jay.

35:27.122 --> 35:29.193
Jesus fucking Christ.

35:29.226 --> 35:30.495
‐
‐Stay back!

35:32.699 --> 35:34.570
‐Jay.
‐Shit.

35:39.045 --> 35:40.748
‐

35:43.221 --> 35:44.590
No. No.

35:44.623 --> 35:46.727
Please wait. What‐‐

35:49.031 --> 35:50.268
‐No!
‐

36:14.783 --> 36:17.489
‐Jay. Jay, no,
come on, let's go.
‐

36:17.522 --> 36:18.691
Come on, Jay!

36:20.495 --> 36:24.035
Jay, faster. Come on.

36:26.207 --> 36:29.213
‐
‐No!

36:32.219 --> 36:33.688
Come on.

36:33.721 --> 36:35.391
Jay.

36:35.425 --> 36:36.393
Come on.

37:09.092 --> 37:10.428
Oh, my God.

37:10.461 --> 37:12.031
‐Boo!
‐Oh!

37:23.688 --> 37:26.126
Hi, Jacob.

37:26.160 --> 37:27.729
Jacob.

37:34.343 --> 37:35.845
Boo?

37:35.878 --> 37:38.517
‐

37:40.388 --> 37:42.057
‐

38:05.705 --> 38:08.076
‐
