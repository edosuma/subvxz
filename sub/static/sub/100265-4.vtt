00:10.260 --> 00:12.887
<i>Astronomers</i>
<i>at the Near Earth Object Office</i>

00:12.971 --> 00:16.349
<i>discovered a sizable, unknown,</i>
<i>celestial object that's headed...</i>

00:16.474 --> 00:19.602
<i>One week ago today,</i> <i>the Earth</i>
<i>was struck by a superbolide meteor</i>

00:19.686 --> 00:22.647
<i>at 9:37 Pacific Standard Time</i>
<i>on Christmas night.</i>

00:22.731 --> 00:25.275
<i>I'm currently standing at the edge</i>
<i>of the quarantine zone in the...</i>

00:25.358 --> 00:27.444
<i>While the whole world</i>
<i>was led to believe</i>

00:27.569 --> 00:30.071
<i>that we had suffered</i>
<i>from a natural disaster,</i>

00:30.155 --> 00:32.782
<i>there were a few of us</i>
<i>that knew the truth:</i>

00:34.367 --> 00:37.787
<i>that this disaster was anything</i>
<i>but "natural."</i>

00:38.329 --> 00:40.331
<i>The crashed alien ship.</i>

00:41.082 --> 00:42.333
<i>Not just a ship...</i>

00:44.169 --> 00:45.295
<i>a pilot.</i>

00:47.297 --> 00:48.673
Go! Go!

00:52.635 --> 00:54.971
- You telling me that thing...

00:55.055 --> 00:56.598
...has been flying the <i>Resolute?</i>

00:57.974 --> 00:59.184
In a manner of speaking.

01:09.152 --> 01:09.986
Secure.

01:12.405 --> 01:13.406
Before we go in,

01:13.990 --> 01:16.493
perhaps we should invite your son
to join us.

01:17.202 --> 01:18.036
Will?

01:18.119 --> 01:21.081
We've been struggling to re-establish
a connection with Scarecrow.

01:21.164 --> 01:22.916
From what I've heard, Will has a unique--

01:22.999 --> 01:24.375
Will is fine where he is.

01:24.459 --> 01:27.212
I'm afraid Ben's getting a little ahead
of himself.

01:28.922 --> 01:29.881
Hastings.

01:31.341 --> 01:34.594
You were CC'd on the classified emails
during the build.

01:35.386 --> 01:38.181
I always wondered
what you were in charge of.

01:39.516 --> 01:40.975
Ready to find out?

01:47.315 --> 01:48.942
I'm trusting you with this information.

01:49.025 --> 01:50.193
Please don't share it.

01:54.739 --> 01:56.699
The real Christmas star.

01:58.034 --> 02:00.245
Able to travel across galaxies

02:00.995 --> 02:03.498
at speeds we couldn't even dream of.

02:03.581 --> 02:08.002
First, we thought we could
reverse engineer their technology,

02:08.086 --> 02:10.046
but we were like Cro-Magnons

02:10.338 --> 02:14.634
trying to rebuild an airplane
when we hadn't even discovered fire.

02:15.343 --> 02:19.013
So you built the <i>Resolute</i>
around the crashed ship?

02:19.597 --> 02:21.599
I found Scarecrow right there.

02:23.101 --> 02:24.519
Right where you're standing.

02:24.602 --> 02:26.396
Still in the process of navigating.

02:27.522 --> 02:29.065
It was badly damaged, as you can see,

02:29.149 --> 02:32.235
but I was able to communicate with him,
in a rudimentary way,

02:32.318 --> 02:34.529
and get him to take us
where we wanted to go.

02:34.612 --> 02:36.865
The robot is like a key.

02:37.699 --> 02:40.368
Without the key, the engine won't start.

02:42.495 --> 02:44.205
But you don't have an engine anymore.

02:44.289 --> 02:45.498
The second robot,

02:45.582 --> 02:48.501
the one that commandeered our ship
and brought us here,

02:48.585 --> 02:49.586
it took it.

02:54.632 --> 02:57.969
If you had another engine,
could you get us all to Alpha Centauri?

03:00.930 --> 03:01.764
Another one?

03:19.324 --> 03:22.368
Mr. Adler, there's no way
we can move this engine to the <i>Resolute.</i>

03:22.452 --> 03:23.661
We're gonna need your machine--

03:23.745 --> 03:25.496
Hey, you can't be down here.

03:25.580 --> 03:27.457
Your family's being relocated
to another Jupiter.

03:27.540 --> 03:28.583
Sorry.

03:29.792 --> 03:33.129
Is it weird to either of you that
everyone's walking around in hazmat suits

03:33.213 --> 03:34.547
and covering everything in plastic

03:34.631 --> 03:36.299
when we've been living here
for seven months

03:36.382 --> 03:38.885
-in t-shirts and flip flops?
-Hey, wait! Is that my shirt?

03:38.968 --> 03:41.638
Is it technically yours
if I'm the only one who's ever worn it?

03:41.721 --> 03:43.306
Um, technically, yes.

03:43.389 --> 03:45.725
And I'm gonna need it.
They say it's like a desert out there.

03:46.476 --> 03:48.102
Okay. Why do you have to go?

03:48.645 --> 03:49.646
They need doctors.

03:49.729 --> 03:53.358
There are 573 people waiting
to reboard the <i>Resolute,</i>

03:53.441 --> 03:55.902
and all of them
need medical clearance first.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.279
The Robinsons are supposed to
stick together.

03:58.363 --> 03:59.948
Yeah. Well, it's only a week.

04:00.031 --> 04:01.115
A lot can happen in a week.

04:01.199 --> 04:02.575
A lot did happen in a week.

04:04.994 --> 04:06.871
They're sending me down
to the planet

04:07.622 --> 04:09.582
to troubleshoot a drilling rig.

04:10.500 --> 04:11.542
Good.

04:12.335 --> 04:15.421
If I'm gonna get the <i>Resolute's</i>
oxygen-generating system flight-ready,

04:15.505 --> 04:17.382
I'm gonna need water, and a lot of it.

04:17.924 --> 04:19.133
You're gonna need?

04:19.217 --> 04:21.344
Well, I have to run a top-to-bottom rehab.

04:21.427 --> 04:22.971
It's been dormant for seven months.

04:23.054 --> 04:25.598
Wait a sec,
you should be glued to those guys.

04:26.057 --> 04:27.183
Adler and Hastings?

04:27.725 --> 04:29.727
They've done fine so far on their own.

04:30.603 --> 04:33.231
But you've been studying that engine
for months.

04:33.314 --> 04:34.565
They have my notes.

04:39.445 --> 04:42.240
Since when are you comfortable
with anyone else managing anything?

04:42.323 --> 04:43.908
I don't want to be involved anymore.

04:43.992 --> 04:45.952
I don't want our family involved.

04:47.245 --> 04:50.415
We need to get to Alpha Centauri
and leave all this behind.

04:53.543 --> 04:56.296
I don't think Will's gonna want
to leave it all behind.

04:56.379 --> 04:57.505
Well, then...

04:58.673 --> 05:00.425
we need to try to help him.

05:02.218 --> 05:03.052
Hey.

05:04.554 --> 05:06.347
Get down there and get me that water.

05:20.528 --> 05:21.946
What's the matter with you?

05:22.613 --> 05:24.574
Work. Who the hell wants
to go back to work?

05:24.657 --> 05:27.452
-I do. Maybe after being cooped up...
- <i>In T minus...</i>

05:27.535 --> 05:29.454
...with the same people for seven months,

05:29.579 --> 05:32.081
I'm looking forward to a little space.
Aren't you?

05:32.165 --> 05:33.875
<i>-...three, two, one.</i>
-Space is overrated.

05:53.144 --> 05:55.063
Do you think Smith will come back
for her stuff?

05:55.146 --> 05:56.481
She can try.

05:56.689 --> 05:57.940
Radic knows she's here.

05:58.024 --> 05:59.692
It's a matter of time
till they find her.

05:59.776 --> 06:01.319
What if she finds us first?

06:01.819 --> 06:02.820
Don't engage.

06:02.904 --> 06:04.781
No. If either of you see her

06:05.281 --> 06:06.991
or if she tries to approach you,

06:07.075 --> 06:08.326
-you call security.
- Hey!

06:08.826 --> 06:10.411
How'd Smith get a copy of this?

06:11.871 --> 06:14.374
I don't know.
She probably picked it up somewhere.

06:21.798 --> 06:24.133
You know,
the Azevedos have a daughter your age.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.885
Maybe you'll have something in common.

06:25.968 --> 06:28.429
Yeah, maybe she's been swept
over a waterfall, too.

06:28.513 --> 06:30.473
You never know until you ask.

06:38.439 --> 06:39.732
Okay, give them space.

06:39.816 --> 06:41.317
What do you think I'm doing?

06:48.199 --> 06:49.617
Come on. Let's go.

06:50.159 --> 06:50.993
Will?

06:51.411 --> 06:53.287
His lights. They moved.

06:54.038 --> 06:55.706
Like he was trying to say something to me.

06:55.790 --> 06:59.168
Maybe he wanted to apologize
for trying to kill you.

07:00.461 --> 07:03.798
Maybe I can help with whatever
they're trying to do on our Jupiter.

07:03.881 --> 07:06.342
There are other people taking care
of this. It's not your responsibility.

07:06.426 --> 07:09.470
It is if I can do something
no one else can do.

07:11.931 --> 07:12.849
Sweetheart...

07:13.724 --> 07:15.476
that is not your robot.

07:16.978 --> 07:18.104
Okay?

07:19.605 --> 07:21.607
Come on, let's go make some new friends.

07:23.651 --> 07:26.571
<i>Through Door Two. Air lock processed.</i>

07:44.297 --> 07:48.050
<i>Elevation: 1,524 meters.</i>

07:48.217 --> 07:51.053
<i>Oxygenation: 99 percent...</i>

07:51.137 --> 07:52.472
Finally some fresh air.

08:09.739 --> 08:13.451
I'm gonna head straight to the drill site,
so I probably won't see you till dinner.

08:13.534 --> 08:16.746
Oh, I was actually planning on eating
with the other first-years tonight.

08:17.163 --> 08:18.289
Oh, great.

08:18.789 --> 08:19.832
Guess I'll just see you.

08:22.418 --> 08:23.920
I don't have any dinner plans.

08:27.006 --> 08:28.132
If--

08:41.145 --> 08:42.855
Uh, hi, are you Dr. Luna?

08:42.939 --> 08:44.774
-I am. Can I help you?
-Yeah, I'm Judy Robinson.

08:44.857 --> 08:46.442
Dr. Carroll was my attending physician.

08:46.526 --> 08:47.401
All right.

08:48.945 --> 08:50.446
- <i>Judy Robinson.</i>
-Good to have you back.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.533
We have a few off-site facilities
that need to be restocked.

08:53.616 --> 08:55.076
Oh, uh, restocked?

08:55.743 --> 08:57.828
Restocked. Yeah, with medical supplies.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.497
Oh, uh, maybe you're not aware.

08:59.580 --> 09:01.958
When we were stranded
I was the only doctor on site.

09:02.041 --> 09:04.210
I treated patients, some, uh, critical.

09:04.418 --> 09:07.171
And I'm sure you did your very best,
but you're back now,

09:07.255 --> 09:08.839
under my supervision,

09:08.923 --> 09:11.217
where all first-year interns
follow protocol.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.516
Why is it whenever the Robinsons arrive,

09:18.599 --> 09:21.227
everyone's supposed to drop
what they're doing and jump into action?

09:26.566 --> 09:28.568
-Good to see you, John.
-And you, Victor.

09:30.027 --> 09:32.530
We received the operational
directive from the <i>Resolute.</i>

09:32.947 --> 09:35.658
Can't tell you how glad I am
that we're getting off this bloody planet.

09:36.033 --> 09:37.076
How's it been here?

09:37.493 --> 09:39.078
Oh, you just have to get used to the fact

09:39.161 --> 09:41.914
you're going to eat a certain amount
of dust every day.

09:42.707 --> 09:44.542
And that's the local wildlife.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.877
I suppose it's good that
we're getting out of here then.

09:46.961 --> 09:47.920
Trouble is,

09:48.004 --> 09:49.964
finding water's been
a consistent challenge.

09:50.047 --> 09:51.173
Barely had enough to live on.

09:51.716 --> 09:53.968
Well Number Three had a brief flurry
of success last night,

09:54.051 --> 09:55.595
but then they encountered more problems.

09:55.678 --> 09:56.846
How do I get down there then?

09:56.929 --> 09:58.306
I'll get transport to take you.

10:00.433 --> 10:01.559
Why now, John?

10:02.852 --> 10:05.313
Now, for months we've been told
the <i>Resolute </i>was beyond repair.

10:05.396 --> 10:06.814
What's changed in the last 24 hours?

10:07.440 --> 10:08.566
What aren't they telling us?

10:14.655 --> 10:16.157
I'll, uh, I'll get that transport.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.199
Glad to have you back.

10:17.283 --> 10:18.284
Thanks.

10:23.539 --> 10:25.082
Okay, let's jump on that now.

10:31.213 --> 10:32.173
Look who's back.

10:32.757 --> 10:33.674
Surprise!

10:34.258 --> 10:36.218
You guys,

10:36.427 --> 10:37.803
I'm back!

10:37.887 --> 10:39.347
Look at your faces.

10:39.430 --> 10:41.891
I know you all missed me,
but the suffering can stop.

10:41.974 --> 10:43.976
-Ooh. Oh.
-Oh! Yeah!

10:45.645 --> 10:46.771
Hey, Andre.

10:48.189 --> 10:51.942
You oughta know we had a whole pool going
to see who was going to punch you first.

10:52.026 --> 10:53.569
I guess I was too slow.

10:53.986 --> 10:54.820
What--

10:54.904 --> 10:56.530
I thought we were a brotherhood.

10:57.323 --> 10:58.282
And a sisterhood.

10:58.366 --> 10:59.367
You're a deserter.

10:59.450 --> 11:01.077
Deserter? That's kind of a harsh term.

11:01.160 --> 11:03.496
I'm sorry. Would you prefer coward,
backstabber, assh--

11:03.579 --> 11:06.666
Whoa! For the record, when everything
went crazy in the <i>Resolute,</i>

11:06.749 --> 11:09.043
I was there helping the colonists
launch their Jupiters.

11:09.126 --> 11:10.044
You abandoned ship.

11:10.127 --> 11:12.046
I was practically kidnapped!

11:12.129 --> 11:14.590
I was held hostage against my will.
It's not--

11:15.466 --> 11:17.551
Come on. Come on, Ava.

11:17.802 --> 11:19.136
I'm your top mechanic.

11:19.637 --> 11:20.805
I make your life easy.

11:22.765 --> 11:23.599
Sorry.

11:23.683 --> 11:24.517
Okay.

11:25.017 --> 11:26.102
Make my life easy.

11:27.353 --> 11:31.023
You see that? That just got back
from Well Three and now it's grinding.

11:31.107 --> 11:32.233
What's wrong with it?

11:32.358 --> 11:34.318
Well, figure it out, "top mechanic."

11:34.402 --> 11:35.861
Okay, well...

11:37.446 --> 11:38.280
I'm on it.

11:38.656 --> 11:40.116
First, I'm gonna hit the medical bay.

11:40.199 --> 11:43.577
There's someone there who's kind of an
expert on my nose, then I'll come back...

11:43.661 --> 11:45.162
I'll just do it now, actually.

11:45.246 --> 11:47.164
It's not big of a--
Good to see you, though.

11:52.044 --> 11:52.920
I'm back.

12:04.890 --> 12:07.351
- Whenever you're ready.
-In a minute.

12:07.435 --> 12:08.269
Okay.

12:08.769 --> 12:10.813
-Someone from medical is joining.
-Oh.

12:14.442 --> 12:15.276
Hey, Jude.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.069
You coming along?

12:17.361 --> 12:18.237
Yup.

12:19.321 --> 12:20.865
Is someone injured at the well site?

12:20.948 --> 12:22.074
Nope.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.005
We really appreciate you taking us
into your home like this.

12:36.130 --> 12:38.924
It should just be for a few days.
The Jupiter is...

12:39.592 --> 12:41.177
having maintenance issues.

12:41.260 --> 12:42.720
Honestly, it's not a problem.

12:42.928 --> 12:44.305
You're helping us.

12:44.388 --> 12:46.807
When we received the message
recalling the skeleton crew,

12:46.891 --> 12:48.392
Elise was nervous.

12:48.476 --> 12:50.394
She didn't wanna come back
to the <i>Resolute.</i>

12:50.478 --> 12:53.606
But when she heard Will Robinson
was going to be her roommate,

12:53.689 --> 12:55.191
she was relieved.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.026
Really, why?

12:57.109 --> 12:59.153
He can control the robots.

13:00.154 --> 13:02.907
We heard about it from the survivors
you were on that planet with.

13:02.990 --> 13:05.951
They said what he did was extraordinary.

13:06.035 --> 13:07.787
He must be a very special boy.

13:08.454 --> 13:09.288
Yes.

13:09.622 --> 13:10.456
He is.

13:12.666 --> 13:15.544
It's sandy.
You have to wear SPF bajillion sunscreen.

13:16.295 --> 13:17.379
Cool, hoodoos!

13:18.088 --> 13:19.715
What's a "hoodoo"?

13:19.799 --> 13:21.300
That weird mushroom totem rock.

13:21.383 --> 13:24.970
They form like that because soft sediment
gets covered by a harder outer layer.

13:26.347 --> 13:27.640
How do you know that?

13:28.390 --> 13:31.143
Well, geology's kind of my thing.

13:31.227 --> 13:33.270
Robots are kind of your thing, too.

13:33.354 --> 13:34.855
Okay, he's twelve.

13:35.189 --> 13:37.316
Okay, bye, guys.

13:37.733 --> 13:38.943
We're going to the systems hub.

13:39.985 --> 13:40.903
Have fun.

13:42.071 --> 13:42.905
Hey.

13:43.531 --> 13:44.740
Can I ask you something?

13:45.282 --> 13:47.576
-About the evacuation?
-Yeah.

13:48.786 --> 13:49.703
My robot,

13:50.287 --> 13:51.413
did you see him leave?

13:52.164 --> 13:53.457
What do you mean?

13:54.416 --> 13:55.459
Well, he was here...

13:56.168 --> 13:58.170
and now he's not.

13:58.254 --> 13:59.672
So where'd he go?

14:00.256 --> 14:02.508
Did he use a ship or was he alone?

14:02.591 --> 14:05.261
Honestly, I was too busy running
to notice.

14:05.845 --> 14:06.971
I'm sorry.

14:13.060 --> 14:15.688
-I have to go, uh, check on Debbie.
-You do?

14:15.771 --> 14:17.273
I wanna make sure she's okay.

14:19.483 --> 14:20.317
Okay.

14:22.570 --> 14:23.529
Who's Debbie?

14:24.238 --> 14:26.657
She's just a chick, uh, with...

14:26.740 --> 14:27.575
red hair.

14:27.783 --> 14:30.119
She's so pretty.

14:43.007 --> 14:44.717
Mike, it's all taken care of.

14:45.718 --> 14:48.637
Make sure they know
the containment unit and secure it.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.222
I'll run a final check.

15:13.245 --> 15:14.663
-Need any help?

15:15.539 --> 15:17.458
I mean, I know you don't need any,
but, uh...

15:17.541 --> 15:18.751
I can handle it.

15:32.181 --> 15:33.682
You the stock girl?

15:34.141 --> 15:35.267
Banged up my knee.

15:35.351 --> 15:39.146
No, I'm a doctor.
Um, I'm happy to take a look at it.

15:39.229 --> 15:41.357
I don't need a doctor.
I just need a bandage.

15:46.111 --> 15:47.780
Okay, sure.

15:55.496 --> 15:56.372
Hey, Angela.

15:59.249 --> 16:00.292
John Robinson.

16:02.002 --> 16:02.920
Hello.

16:03.754 --> 16:06.048
I just wanted to say that I'm--

16:06.131 --> 16:07.132
It's good you're here.

16:07.216 --> 16:09.468
I could use somebody I know
who's got my back.

16:13.013 --> 16:15.516
So off the record, what's your assessment?

16:15.599 --> 16:16.892
I have concerns.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.560
You're the one they sent to help?

16:19.061 --> 16:19.937
If I can.

16:20.020 --> 16:22.690
It wasn't easy, but we finally drilled
through the bedrock;

16:22.773 --> 16:24.024
hit an aquifer last night.

16:24.108 --> 16:27.736
It was an unusually high-pressure event.
Water shot up into the air.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.656
Drenched the rig, the workers, everything.

16:30.739 --> 16:32.116
It was a gas pocket.

16:32.741 --> 16:33.951
They happen.

16:35.452 --> 16:36.745
So where do we stand now?

16:36.829 --> 16:39.373
Well, here's the strange thing,
when we turned it all back on again

16:39.456 --> 16:40.582
the flow stopped.

16:40.666 --> 16:42.751
We had to send a tanker back half-full.

16:43.085 --> 16:45.963
Well, a block wouldn't necessarily show up
on the sensors.

16:46.130 --> 16:48.048
Someone will have to go down
and take a look.

16:48.132 --> 16:51.635
Yeah, well, how 'bout we make
that someone you, Mr. Robinson?

17:17.828 --> 17:19.955
There's no block in the first two strings.

17:20.330 --> 17:22.041
Must be further down.

17:22.124 --> 17:24.501
-So what do you think it is?
- <i>Uh...</i>

17:24.835 --> 17:26.795
<i>I don't know. Sediment, coupling.</i>

17:27.546 --> 17:29.006
I just can't figure it out.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.934
- Hey, do you hear that?
- What?

18:44.123 --> 18:48.669
<i>...on the plastic.</i>
<i>Finish up and get back to the garage.</i>

19:28.000 --> 19:30.669
<i>...since the beginning.</i>

19:31.003 --> 19:33.380
<i>We're also gonna do something new.</i>

19:33.755 --> 19:35.007
<i>Let's try again.</i>

19:45.851 --> 19:47.519
Someone's here to see you.

19:48.562 --> 19:49.396
Who?

19:53.150 --> 19:55.611
Why is our Jupiter sealed in plastic?

19:55.694 --> 19:56.904
It's not your Jupiter.

19:57.446 --> 19:58.822
What are you doing here?

19:59.198 --> 20:01.909
The head of security wants to arrest me.

20:04.077 --> 20:05.662
For once, she speaks the truth.

20:07.456 --> 20:10.417
You remind me so much of me sometimes.

20:11.126 --> 20:12.544
You know how to read people,

20:13.503 --> 20:15.005
you deflect with humor...

20:18.383 --> 20:20.093
and you're good at spotting a lie.

20:23.013 --> 20:24.848
That's why you write so well.

20:25.432 --> 20:26.433
You can't hide here.

20:26.934 --> 20:29.269
I'm on a spaceship. I can't hide anywhere.

20:30.103 --> 20:31.939
But if I'm gonna be incarcerated,

20:32.522 --> 20:34.816
I'd really like some reading material.

20:34.900 --> 20:35.943
Go to the library.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.278
I was actually hoping you'd...

20:39.821 --> 20:42.241
you'd have an extra copy of your book.

20:44.534 --> 20:46.828
Yeah. I, uh, actually have your copy.

20:48.538 --> 20:49.623
You can have it back.

20:54.836 --> 20:57.464
Uh, you don't have to spy on us.
It's unnerving.

20:58.340 --> 21:01.009
How do you know the Robinsons?

21:01.093 --> 21:02.803
I'm their family therapist.

21:04.096 --> 21:04.972
Really?

21:05.055 --> 21:06.723
They have a lot of issues.

21:08.016 --> 21:09.434
If we're so similar,

21:10.018 --> 21:12.187
can you tell me how you turned into you?

21:12.271 --> 21:13.438
Afraid you might become me?

21:13.522 --> 21:14.648
Terrified.

21:14.731 --> 21:16.191
I'll tell you my secret:

21:16.275 --> 21:18.277
at some point in life you'll learn...

21:19.903 --> 21:21.738
it's better to be feared than loved.

21:21.863 --> 21:23.782
I mean, have you ever even been loved?

21:30.455 --> 21:32.749
I'm glad we had
this little heart-to-heart.

21:39.715 --> 21:41.466
Appreciate the call, Miss Robinson.

21:47.222 --> 21:48.098
Jessica Harris...

21:49.182 --> 21:50.350
you're under arrest.

21:53.729 --> 21:55.355
-I figured it out.
-What?

21:55.439 --> 21:57.774
-How does this place function without me?
-Don.

21:57.899 --> 21:59.151
It was the axle.

21:59.401 --> 22:01.862
The locking bolts
on the CV joints were missing.

22:02.195 --> 22:03.905
She's gonna purr like a kitty now.

22:06.783 --> 22:09.077
-That shouldn't be happening!
-Mm-hm.

22:09.161 --> 22:10.454
Uh, Angela?

22:10.537 --> 22:11.580
Hey, are you okay?

22:12.247 --> 22:13.707
It's just, uh...

22:13.790 --> 22:15.250
I can't find my wedding ring.

22:15.834 --> 22:17.919
Uh, where did you last take it off?

22:18.003 --> 22:21.465
I didn't take it off! I never take it off!

22:22.924 --> 22:24.343
It's all I have left of him.

22:24.968 --> 22:27.220
Okay, hey, we're gonna find it.

22:27.554 --> 22:30.390
Hey, we're gonna find it. It's fine.
I'll help you look for it, all right?

22:31.933 --> 22:33.018
Okay.

22:33.643 --> 22:35.354
Um, we need to prep the Jupiter.

22:35.437 --> 22:36.855
-Let's load this thing.
-Yup, got it.

22:36.938 --> 22:37.939
Let me take another look.

22:38.023 --> 22:40.525
I know you're trying to make amends,
but I got a schedule to keep.

22:40.609 --> 22:41.443
That's not it.

22:41.526 --> 22:43.362
I checked every inch of this tanker.

22:43.487 --> 22:45.197
If something's wrong,
we shouldn't load it.

22:45.280 --> 22:47.866
This water's top priority.
It goes to the <i>Resolute.</i>

22:55.999 --> 22:58.043
Hey, Angela, is this it?

22:58.794 --> 22:59.628
Yes!

23:00.379 --> 23:01.213
Thank you.

23:05.133 --> 23:06.635
Wait. Whoa. What's happening?

23:07.386 --> 23:08.553
This doesn't make sense.

23:08.637 --> 23:11.598
Titanium doesn't just fall apart.

23:15.894 --> 23:17.020
Let's try this one.

23:22.526 --> 23:23.610
What the hell?

23:27.948 --> 23:30.075
The well out there,
what is it made out of?

23:32.911 --> 23:34.204
Dear God.

23:34.704 --> 23:35.622
Dad.

23:38.500 --> 23:40.460
Everyone, get away from the well!

23:40.794 --> 23:42.671
-Get away from the well!
-What are you doing?

23:42.754 --> 23:44.047
Oh, my God.

23:44.131 --> 23:46.133
-We gotta get outta here.

23:46.216 --> 23:47.134
Hurry up!

23:47.217 --> 23:48.093
Go!

23:56.101 --> 23:56.977
Great.

23:58.603 --> 24:00.772
Move, move, move! Get off the well!

24:04.985 --> 24:06.653
- Move it!
-Hey, hurry up!

24:08.613 --> 24:10.574
- Go, go, go!
- Go! Come on!

24:30.385 --> 24:31.511
Man down!

24:32.888 --> 24:34.055
Hey. Hey!

24:34.139 --> 24:35.348
Hey, don't move him!

24:35.724 --> 24:37.434
All right, take the beam off slowly.

24:37.517 --> 24:40.061
- We gotcha, buddy.
- All right, go slow. Go slow.

24:40.687 --> 24:41.897
Okay, come on.

24:48.236 --> 24:49.070
How can I help?

24:49.154 --> 24:50.322
He's decompensating.

24:50.405 --> 24:52.532
We don't have enough equipment.
Need to get him to base.

24:54.743 --> 24:56.369
Hey, where's my dad?

24:56.453 --> 24:57.412
Lift him up!

24:58.038 --> 24:59.206
It was solid metal.

24:59.498 --> 25:00.665
Hey, where is he?

25:02.918 --> 25:04.169
I sent him down.

25:09.466 --> 25:12.302
<i>All it has to do</i>
<i>is pick up the engine and move it.</i>

25:12.385 --> 25:13.845
<i>How hard could that be?</i>

25:13.929 --> 25:16.515
<i>I think we all could use</i>
<i>a few minutes to clear our heads.</i>

25:16.598 --> 25:18.600
- <i>Take ten.</i>
- <i>Fine.</i>

25:58.765 --> 25:59.599
Huh.

26:32.924 --> 26:34.217
He's not in any pain,

26:34.301 --> 26:35.885
if that's what you're thinking.

26:36.094 --> 26:37.846
That's exactly what I was thinking.

26:38.305 --> 26:39.514
You know,

26:40.098 --> 26:42.517
when I was your age, I wanted a robot.

26:43.852 --> 26:45.103
I think a lot of kids do.

26:45.687 --> 26:49.107
I didn't know that finding one
on an alien planet was an option,

26:49.190 --> 26:53.361
so I became a researcher,
specializing in artificial intelligence.

26:55.655 --> 26:58.742
I want to talk to them, not hurt them.

26:59.326 --> 27:02.662
The jolts we're giving it are
a primitive form of communication.

27:03.330 --> 27:06.750
Pure stimulus to achieve
a simple response.

27:08.668 --> 27:12.505
Seems like trying to have a conversation
with someone

27:12.589 --> 27:15.258
by hitting them with a stick.

27:19.137 --> 27:22.807
From what I've been told,
you had a very special experience

27:22.891 --> 27:24.476
with a fully-functioning robot.

27:25.852 --> 27:28.313
I wish I'd have had the chance
with Scarecrow.

27:29.522 --> 27:30.774
That's what you call him?

27:32.734 --> 27:35.945
He was just a raggedy thing
when we found him on the crash site;

27:36.029 --> 27:38.156
leaking what looked like straw--

27:38.823 --> 27:40.950
Glowing straw, granted.

27:41.951 --> 27:44.204
I was brought in to communicate with him,

27:44.954 --> 27:48.166
which was nearly impossible,
given his extreme damage.

27:48.750 --> 27:52.212
And all I could think was,
"If I only had a brain."

27:53.838 --> 27:54.839
His face...

27:56.341 --> 27:58.134
doesn't look right.

27:58.218 --> 28:00.512
He has less lights.

28:01.221 --> 28:02.180
He looks...

28:04.015 --> 28:05.016
confused.

28:08.937 --> 28:12.440
And now we're asking him to do something
we've never asked him before.

28:14.359 --> 28:17.278
But if he can't move that
back to the <i>Resolute,</i>

28:18.655 --> 28:21.533
I'm afraid we're gonna be stuck
in this place permanently.

28:21.616 --> 28:23.618
Maybe he doesn't wanna help.

28:26.246 --> 28:28.081
They do feel things.

28:29.916 --> 28:32.252
It's common to personify anything that has

28:32.502 --> 28:34.963
what may be considered a face
to have human feelings.

28:35.046 --> 28:35.880
I...

28:35.964 --> 28:37.590
felt things.

28:37.674 --> 28:38.633
What do you mean?

28:43.346 --> 28:44.347
My Robot and I...

28:45.974 --> 28:47.809
were connected.

28:50.145 --> 28:52.272
He knew what I was thinking.

28:54.524 --> 28:55.608
Sometimes...

28:56.735 --> 28:58.486
I could even see what he saw.

29:02.198 --> 29:03.783
Let me try to connect with him.

29:04.325 --> 29:06.286
-I don't think that's wise.
-I can do it!

29:08.621 --> 29:09.914
Need to ask your mother.

29:09.998 --> 29:12.709
She'll say, "No." She doesn't understand.

29:16.463 --> 29:18.381
I know the missing piece, Mr. Adler.

29:20.216 --> 29:21.176
Let me help you.

29:25.180 --> 29:26.347
Dad, can you hear me?

29:27.140 --> 29:29.934
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>Judy, I'm all right.</i>

29:30.018 --> 29:32.103
Okay, I have to get a patient back
to medical,

29:32.187 --> 29:34.147
but don't worry.
We're gonna get you outta there.

29:34.230 --> 29:36.691
Don't worry about me.
We've got bigger problems.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.234
Like what?

29:38.318 --> 29:41.905
Tanker that left for base camp
was carrying water from this well.

29:42.489 --> 29:44.073
<i>It's headed for the </i>Resolute.

29:48.161 --> 29:49.871
<i>Don? Don?</i>

29:51.289 --> 29:52.123
Don West here.

29:52.207 --> 29:54.417
There's something in the well.
Something that rots metal.

29:54.501 --> 29:56.294
You have to quarantine it.
It's in that tanker.

29:58.338 --> 30:00.381
It's already on the Jupiter.
It's about to take off.

30:00.465 --> 30:02.175
Well, you can't let it leave!

30:03.134 --> 30:04.219
Okay, I'm on it!

30:06.304 --> 30:08.306
Ava! Ava, come in!

30:08.389 --> 30:09.724
Excuse me! Sorry!

30:10.475 --> 30:12.852
Ava! Move! Move!

30:19.901 --> 30:22.779
Stop! Stop! Stop! Shut it down!
Shut it down!

30:23.321 --> 30:24.906
-Shut it down!
-What?

30:24.989 --> 30:25.824
Why?

30:25.907 --> 30:27.492
That tanker cannot go up there.

30:27.575 --> 30:29.035
Are you serious? This thing has to--

30:29.118 --> 30:30.829
Hey! You know you can be demoted
to tool boy!

30:30.912 --> 30:32.747
No, you're gonna give me a promotion!

30:32.831 --> 30:33.748
What, why?

30:33.832 --> 30:35.667
Because you just saved the <i>Resolute!</i>

30:39.462 --> 30:40.296
Ready.

31:02.777 --> 31:03.653
Hey.

31:04.237 --> 31:05.738
My name is Will Robinson.

31:10.952 --> 31:14.247
I told you, Will, this robot
doesn't respond the same way yours did.

31:26.426 --> 31:28.303
It's nice to see you out of your box.

31:30.138 --> 31:31.472
The last time we met,

31:32.307 --> 31:33.850
you seemed kind of angry.

31:34.809 --> 31:37.103
I would be too if I were left alone...

31:37.979 --> 31:39.147
and hurt.

31:59.626 --> 32:02.045
I saw you were missing some pieces.

32:04.631 --> 32:06.132
Thought maybe this could help.

32:08.301 --> 32:09.344
Easy, Will.

32:31.616 --> 32:32.742
Careful.

32:32.867 --> 32:33.785
It's okay.

32:35.411 --> 32:36.245
Wait.

32:48.132 --> 32:49.467
You were attacked?

32:50.343 --> 32:51.678
Some robots hurt people...

32:52.929 --> 32:54.138
but they don't have to.

32:58.393 --> 33:00.228
They can choose to help too.

33:03.856 --> 33:05.525
A quarter of the APS is shot.

33:06.025 --> 33:09.195
They can share power as long
as we operate in conservation mode.

33:10.029 --> 33:12.156
Does she seem distracted to you?

33:12.240 --> 33:14.534
She's the most
focused person I know.

33:14.617 --> 33:16.911
I'm sure she's just... calculating.

33:18.079 --> 33:21.624
Maureen, it looks like
we'll have to reconfigure the APS by hand.

33:24.252 --> 33:25.461
Maureen?

33:26.129 --> 33:27.046
What?

33:28.131 --> 33:29.382
Oh, yes.

33:29.465 --> 33:31.759
Yeah, that's... That's perfect.

33:45.940 --> 33:46.983
He's my friend.

33:50.903 --> 33:52.155
He helps us.

33:58.578 --> 34:00.621
He-- He saved my life.

34:05.043 --> 34:06.586
And I thought that maybe...

34:08.629 --> 34:10.298
we could be friends, too.

34:27.690 --> 34:28.691
Will!

34:42.288 --> 34:43.623
-Are you okay?
-Fine!

34:43.790 --> 34:45.166
I'm fine. Nothing happened.

34:49.504 --> 34:51.089
Go wait for me outside, please.

34:56.344 --> 34:57.553
What were you thinking?

34:58.429 --> 34:59.764
He snuck in.

34:59.847 --> 35:01.641
Right, and then you,
as the adult in the room,

35:01.724 --> 35:02.975
told him to leave.

35:03.601 --> 35:06.020
I was always in control.
He was never in any real danger.

35:06.104 --> 35:06.938
Really?

35:09.524 --> 35:11.859
But you're right.
I was out of line. I'm sorry.

35:12.527 --> 35:14.612
We're just running out of options here.

35:15.113 --> 35:16.781
Improve your security.

35:26.415 --> 35:28.417
<i>Dr. Zoe Smith.</i>

35:31.546 --> 35:33.005
You've been very busy.

35:33.089 --> 35:35.466
New name, new career...

35:35.550 --> 35:36.551
I'm sorry.

35:36.634 --> 35:39.846
You clearly have me confused
with someone else.

35:39.971 --> 35:41.514
I don't think so.

35:41.722 --> 35:43.891
I don't think Maureen Robinson
was confused either.

35:43.975 --> 35:45.643
If you spoke with Maureen,

35:46.227 --> 35:47.311
you'd know

35:47.520 --> 35:49.188
I saved her husband's life

35:49.939 --> 35:53.526
and sailed their Jupiter
through a methane-infested sea storm

35:53.860 --> 35:55.611
and donated blood

35:55.820 --> 35:56.988
to a crew member.

35:57.071 --> 35:58.322
She never mentioned that.

35:58.406 --> 36:00.116
Penny wrote all about me in her book.

36:00.199 --> 36:01.367
She calls me by name.

36:01.450 --> 36:02.785
It's right here.

36:08.040 --> 36:09.876
So your defense is
in a little girl's diary.

36:17.049 --> 36:19.594
There's no mention of any Zoe Smith.

36:19.969 --> 36:21.220
I come in later.

36:21.304 --> 36:22.930
-Keep looking.
- Mm-hmm.

36:35.026 --> 36:35.860
What's this?

36:36.694 --> 36:39.155
That's strange.

36:39.238 --> 36:42.033
-Uh, I've been being polite,

36:42.491 --> 36:45.703
but unless you have any actual evidence
to support this

36:45.786 --> 36:47.997
crazy theory that I'm somehow--

36:48.080 --> 36:51.042
The death of one of my men
is not theoretical.

36:53.252 --> 36:54.462
Pull up security feed.

36:54.545 --> 36:57.423
Saul, day twenty-seven,
common deck, airlock five.

37:00.927 --> 37:03.971
<i>Sir,</i>
<i>there's no footage for that camera.</i>

37:04.138 --> 37:06.766
Well, try the interrogation room,
same day.

37:08.476 --> 37:10.144
<i>Negative, sir. Nothing there.</i>

37:11.145 --> 37:13.356
We've all been under
a lot of stress.

37:13.564 --> 37:15.942
A mistake like this was bound to happen.

37:17.276 --> 37:18.611
I just want you to know,

37:19.195 --> 37:20.988
I won't be pressing any charges.

37:21.072 --> 37:22.073
I know what you did.

37:23.115 --> 37:24.659
I'm your judge and jury,

37:25.451 --> 37:26.661
and as long as I'm...

37:32.166 --> 37:33.084
Are you okay?

37:33.709 --> 37:35.711
I can't move my hand.

37:36.212 --> 37:37.213
My arm is...

37:40.132 --> 37:41.133
What did you do?

37:41.801 --> 37:43.261
I think you need a doctor.

37:44.428 --> 37:46.055
What's happening?

37:49.100 --> 37:50.559
Don't worry,

37:50.810 --> 37:53.896
they'll put you in a coma
before the toxin reaches your brain.

37:54.897 --> 37:56.440
You've been working very hard.

37:56.524 --> 37:57.984
You deserve a nice long nap.

38:01.070 --> 38:01.904
<i>Help!</i>

38:03.030 --> 38:04.240
<i>Someone help!</i>

38:04.490 --> 38:06.284
<i>He needs help!</i>

38:22.800 --> 38:25.011
How'd you know
I was in the Jupiter?

38:25.094 --> 38:25.928
I didn't.

38:26.595 --> 38:30.182
Guess I was just as curious about
what's going on in there as you were.

38:43.529 --> 38:45.614
I'm sorry I didn't listen.

38:46.198 --> 38:47.783
I really thought I could do it;

38:49.660 --> 38:52.580
that I could connect with this robot too.

38:54.415 --> 38:55.833
That maybe...

38:57.126 --> 38:58.961
I could make a difference.

39:02.631 --> 39:04.216
But I guess you were right.

39:09.764 --> 39:15.311
You know, Grandma used to get
so mad at me for looking up at the stars.

39:16.520 --> 39:19.273
She just-- She didn't see the sense
in thinking about

39:19.357 --> 39:20.775
a place that you could never get to.

39:21.859 --> 39:23.944
I-- You can't blame her because back then

39:24.028 --> 39:27.823
it would have taken 81,000 years
to get to the nearest one, but...

39:30.034 --> 39:30.868
here I am.

39:33.954 --> 39:37.500
Because the thing is,
it didn't matter what she said

39:38.918 --> 39:40.795
or if she was right.

39:42.088 --> 39:44.673
I was going to do whatever it took

39:45.383 --> 39:47.843
to get exactly to this very spot.

39:49.512 --> 39:52.056
Because I believed in my heart

39:53.516 --> 39:55.935
that it's what I was meant to do.

39:58.562 --> 40:01.732
So what do you think Grandma would say
if you could see her now?

40:04.652 --> 40:07.238
Oh, she'd probably look at me
with those eyes of hers and say,

40:07.321 --> 40:09.573
"If you're up there,
who's watching the farm?"

40:12.410 --> 40:13.411
Yeah.

40:15.871 --> 40:16.997
So what do we do now?

40:18.624 --> 40:21.627
With no way to get that engine working,
we're still stranded.

40:23.462 --> 40:24.797
You know, all this time...

40:25.589 --> 40:28.384
I've been trying to get us
to Alpha Centauri, I think...

40:28.843 --> 40:30.803
I've been going about it the wrong way.

40:31.429 --> 40:32.346
What do you mean?

40:34.515 --> 40:37.017
I mean,
I've been trying to do it all by myself.

40:40.980 --> 40:41.897
Come on,

40:41.981 --> 40:44.108
there's something I think you need to see.

41:33.199 --> 41:34.033
Go ahead.

41:34.116 --> 41:37.119
<i>Maureen Robinson's here.</i>
<i>She wants to access the engine room.</i>

41:37.203 --> 41:38.204
<i>Her son is with her.</i>

41:40.539 --> 41:43.000
<i>We returned the Scarecrow.</i>
<i>It's back in its place.</i>

41:43.083 --> 41:44.126
Is it secure?

41:44.210 --> 41:45.085
<i>Yes.</i>

41:48.464 --> 41:49.590
Then let them in.

42:02.019 --> 42:03.437
Pretty incredible, isn't it?

42:04.647 --> 42:06.690
No wonder only robots can fly it.

42:26.752 --> 42:28.712
There's something I need to say to you.

42:30.130 --> 42:31.590
We may never be friends.

42:33.050 --> 42:35.594
You may never even understand
what I'm saying...

42:40.599 --> 42:42.601
but you don't belong in a box.

42:50.317 --> 42:51.527
Hm? What is it?

43:09.587 --> 43:10.796
SAR and Robot...

43:10.879 --> 43:12.298
it looks like--

43:12.381 --> 43:13.382
They fought here.

43:28.105 --> 43:30.858
-Hey!

43:30.941 --> 43:32.985
-Are you okay?

43:35.070 --> 43:36.238
I found him.

43:36.697 --> 43:38.198
I found the robot.

43:39.450 --> 43:42.578
He's here.
Down on that planet.
