WEBVTT

00:02.852 --> 00:05.913
The reason
Tyler McKinney is here,
is me.

00:05.990 --> 00:07.753
We're sitting here
in the middle of the jungle,

00:07.825 --> 00:11.317
with you all shot up and me
with less than half a chance
of getting us out of here

00:11.395 --> 00:12.828
and you aren't even
considering the fact

00:12.897 --> 00:14.922
that Magnum and Higgins
might not be coming back.

00:14.999 --> 00:16.056
One way or the other,

00:16.133 --> 00:17.600
baby and I
are gonna have
the biggest wedding

00:17.668 --> 00:18.657
Honolulu's ever seen.

00:18.736 --> 00:19.896
They're going
to get wiped out.

00:19.971 --> 00:22.940
That's just the price
we're gonna have to pay
for getting Long Tang out.

00:23.007 --> 00:25.874
You know, one day
I want to be like you.
Be free.

00:25.943 --> 00:27.308
You're not free?

01:36.080 --> 01:37.911
Any ideas?

01:38.916 --> 01:40.781
Nope.
Me either.

01:40.851 --> 01:43.547
<i>Last week on</i>
<i>Part One,</i> All For One.

01:46.123 --> 01:47.522
What are you here for,
Tyler?

01:47.591 --> 01:50.116
You remember that execution
I was talking about?

01:50.194 --> 01:54.062
Well, it wasn't just mine,
it was J.J. Quincannon's,
too.

01:54.165 --> 01:56.759
I managed to skate it,
but they still got J.J.

01:57.068 --> 02:00.060
Who's they?
The Viets,
and that's why I'm here.

02:00.171 --> 02:03.197
I want you guys
to come back with me
and get him out.

02:03.274 --> 02:06.766
For you, gentlemen,
are asking me and my crew

02:06.844 --> 02:09.574
to risk our lives
on a dangerous journey

02:10.080 --> 02:12.879
into a remote part
of the country
where there is no law

02:12.950 --> 02:16.147
just private armies
of the opium warlords.

02:16.554 --> 02:19.489
I'm fine.
Just fine.

02:19.857 --> 02:21.154
What's wrong with him?

02:21.225 --> 02:23.352
He was wondering
if it was preordained

02:23.427 --> 02:26.225
that we were supposed
to die in Southeast Asia.

02:27.731 --> 02:29.995
We've been set up.
They want the guns.

02:35.840 --> 02:38.673
Have you started the flow?
Got it.

02:38.909 --> 02:41.434
Now prepare
Rick's arm for the other end.

02:41.512 --> 02:42.809
T. C: This chopper
must've been here...

02:42.880 --> 02:44.177
Ten years, I'd say.

02:44.248 --> 02:49.015
Higgins stays here with Rick.
T.C. Too. He fixes this thing,
if he can.

02:49.086 --> 02:51.816
And you and me?
We go after J.J.

02:52.223 --> 02:54.123
Out of sight.

02:54.191 --> 02:55.681
Get down.
There's a...

02:55.759 --> 02:59.058
Vietnamese outpost
about another click straight
ahead down the road.

02:59.130 --> 03:01.860
Probably garrisoned
by no more than,
like, a squad.

03:02.266 --> 03:05.997
That's probably
where they got J.J.
- Magnum.

03:06.137 --> 03:09.265
Why are you here?
I wasn't going to get cheated.

03:10.174 --> 03:12.699
Yeah, looks like
we're all gonna
get cheated,

03:13.277 --> 03:15.006
right here and now.

04:05.863 --> 04:07.330
Opium.

04:07.765 --> 04:11.428
The Major buys the plants
from the surrounding
villagers for a pittance,

04:12.670 --> 04:14.900
then refines it here himself,

04:15.539 --> 04:19.406
converting it to opium,
then converting that to...

04:19.642 --> 04:21.338
Pretty good living.

04:23.214 --> 04:26.843
That's the one other
thing we're here for.

04:27.785 --> 04:30.549
In a manner of speaking,
yeah.

04:31.288 --> 04:35.349
Forget it, Magnum.
You can't kill me
till we get out of here.

04:35.693 --> 04:38.287
You led us here
under false pretenses.

04:39.330 --> 04:42.197
Just like Cam Ly.
- What happened there?

04:42.266 --> 04:45.235
Another friend of mine
is gonna die because
I believed you.

04:45.302 --> 04:48.362
Oh, forget it.
You didn't believe in me.
How could you?

04:48.939 --> 04:50.668
I wouldn't.

04:50.874 --> 04:53.866
You believed in something,
friendship maybe.

04:54.945 --> 04:56.845
Maybe some kind of ideals.

04:56.981 --> 05:00.883
Or maybe just the action,
one more time.

05:01.352 --> 05:03.081
That's what mattered
to you guys.

05:03.220 --> 05:04.744
And you, Mr. McKinney?

05:05.122 --> 05:06.521
Are you trying
to convince us

05:06.590 --> 05:08.455
that you don't
share those values?

05:08.525 --> 05:12.586
I don't have to.
All that matters
is I screwed up.

05:13.397 --> 05:16.389
And for that, sir,
I apologize to you.

05:16.467 --> 05:17.934
What about J. J?

05:18.002 --> 05:20.630
J.J. Quincannon is dead.

05:27.878 --> 05:30.574
And your friend
here should know that.

05:30.648 --> 05:32.479
He saw me kill him.

05:33.450 --> 05:35.714
As I will personally
do to him.

05:37.121 --> 05:38.952
And you.

05:39.223 --> 05:43.523
But unlike you Americans,
I ask questions first.

05:44.795 --> 05:46.626
And shoot later.

05:58.442 --> 05:59.966
Have a nice day.

06:08.152 --> 06:09.676
They all died.

06:11.322 --> 06:13.347
Every single one of them.

06:17.161 --> 06:19.186
It was the worst year
of my life.

06:26.270 --> 06:28.261
It was the best year
of my life.

06:29.907 --> 06:31.169
'69.

06:33.610 --> 06:35.271
Cubs.

06:37.848 --> 06:39.679
Ernie Banks, first base.

06:41.051 --> 06:42.575
Glenn...

06:43.520 --> 06:45.784
Glenn Beckert, second base.

06:48.525 --> 06:52.052
Don Kessinger, shortstop.

06:52.963 --> 06:56.330
Ron Santo, third base.

06:56.867 --> 06:59.563
Randy Hundley, catcher.

07:05.843 --> 07:07.105
My Pop.

07:08.412 --> 07:10.141
The bleachers.

07:11.148 --> 07:12.672
But I...

07:16.553 --> 07:18.919
Can't remember
who played center field.

07:20.124 --> 07:21.751
I can't remember.

07:23.193 --> 07:24.455
Don Young.

07:25.629 --> 07:26.823
Yeah.

07:26.897 --> 07:29.092
Yeah, Don Young.

07:29.333 --> 07:32.131
It was Don Young.

07:34.371 --> 07:37.272
Pop! Pop!

07:37.908 --> 07:41.173
You said they choked.
They, they didn't...

07:41.912 --> 07:46.781
They didn't.
It ain't choking when
something is meant to be.

07:49.753 --> 07:52.813
You can't change
your destiny.

07:54.191 --> 07:56.091
Rick? Rick?

07:59.096 --> 08:02.463
You remember
when it was over?

08:03.801 --> 08:07.931
Baltimore played New York
in the series.

08:10.207 --> 08:12.539
I enlisted in the Marines.

08:14.545 --> 08:17.378
Never saw a ballgame again.

08:28.759 --> 08:30.454
You'll stay with him?

08:30.694 --> 08:32.558
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

08:33.697 --> 08:36.063
You stay with him.

08:45.542 --> 08:50.502
Now you have oil,
now you have brake fluid,
now you fly.

08:51.081 --> 08:52.776
Maybe.

08:54.318 --> 08:57.651
Where'd you get this?
I borrow.

08:58.956 --> 09:01.356
What's your name, kid?
Norodom Hanamut.

09:01.425 --> 09:04.360
Norodom Hanamut.
Call me Joe.

09:04.428 --> 09:06.453
Oh, no, no, no, no.
You drive.

09:07.197 --> 09:08.630
Me?

09:09.600 --> 09:10.658
You.

10:02.619 --> 10:04.314
I'm sorry, Higgins.

10:05.756 --> 10:07.724
My God, man. What for?

10:08.659 --> 10:11.719
For letting myself take
another sucker punch
from Tyler,

10:12.329 --> 10:14.422
and letting you guys
take one, too.

10:15.532 --> 10:19.195
That is patently
the most absurd statement
I've ever heard you make.

10:19.603 --> 10:22.731
And I've heard
a multitude of them
throughout the years.

10:23.774 --> 10:26.470
But this one in particular
does not become you.

10:27.411 --> 10:29.470
Why's that?
Tell me.

10:30.113 --> 10:34.106
Because each and every one
of us, Rick, T.C., you, me,

10:34.818 --> 10:37.616
all arrived at the same
conclusion independently.

10:42.125 --> 10:43.820
We believed McKinney.

10:44.995 --> 10:46.860
We believed
in his mission.

10:48.332 --> 10:51.495
And perhaps
we still should.
Why?

10:57.507 --> 10:59.236
What happened at Cam Ly?

11:12.623 --> 11:15.217
It was around
Christmas of '69.

11:16.360 --> 11:19.352
Rick was new, but T.C.
And Eddie Miller and I,

11:19.429 --> 11:21.659
we were pretty good buddies.

11:22.666 --> 11:25.897
Tyler McKinney
was just a guy we saw
every once in a while.

11:26.103 --> 11:28.401
He'd come and go,
never wore ID,

11:29.640 --> 11:31.870
and I guess we all
had him figured for

11:32.442 --> 11:34.000
some kind of a spook.

11:43.186 --> 11:44.744
I remember one night,

11:46.590 --> 11:48.717
I was reading
a letter from my mom.

11:49.359 --> 11:50.724
It was raining.

11:51.928 --> 11:54.624
It was raining so hard,
the whole war had stopped.

11:54.698 --> 11:57.599
Nobody was doing anything
except trying to stay dry.

12:00.537 --> 12:05.236
T.C. Was playing cards
with Eddie and Rick
and I was reading

12:06.309 --> 12:10.370
and re-reading
my mom's letter,

12:10.781 --> 12:12.305
when all of a sudden,

12:13.917 --> 12:16.545
the door came open,
the rain blew in

12:17.888 --> 12:22.291
and there was Tyler McKinney
asking us to sneak a slick
out of the compound.

12:23.760 --> 12:26.752
And fly with him across
the border into Cambodia.

12:28.198 --> 12:30.359
It was illegal then,
off-limits.

12:30.767 --> 12:32.530
It's off-limits now, too.

12:37.574 --> 12:40.839
Tyler said there was
a listening post

12:40.911 --> 12:43.402
about 20 minutes flying time
over the border

12:43.480 --> 12:45.778
near Cam Ly.

12:47.084 --> 12:49.575
A whole modern
electronics complex

12:49.653 --> 12:52.019
they were using
to monitor
our troop movements.

12:52.089 --> 12:53.818
Tyler said
because of this outpost,

12:53.890 --> 12:55.983
three good friends
of his had bought it,

12:56.059 --> 12:58.186
a lot of others
he didn't know.

12:58.762 --> 13:01.458
Legally,
we couldn't touch it.
I see.

13:02.032 --> 13:03.932
Cam Ly was out of bounds.

13:04.668 --> 13:07.159
There was no electronics
surveillance post?

13:08.171 --> 13:09.798
Oh, yes.
Yes, there was.

13:09.873 --> 13:13.673
We flew in,
we infiltrated the perimeter.
We blew the buildings.

13:14.277 --> 13:16.177
Destroyed the tunnels.

13:22.452 --> 13:24.750
Then Tyler's intelligence
was correct?

13:25.555 --> 13:28.080
The only thing
he was guilty of and you,

13:28.592 --> 13:31.425
was taking illegal
and unauthorized action.

13:33.897 --> 13:35.922
And getting
Eddie Miller killed.

13:37.200 --> 13:38.599
Magnum,

13:38.802 --> 13:43.034
in war, death is something
that all soldiers...
Except it wasn't war, Higgins.

13:43.373 --> 13:44.772
It was personal.

13:49.346 --> 13:51.644
Tyler's intelligence
was good.

13:52.449 --> 13:55.646
He knew
the Vietnamese captain
in command of that post

13:55.719 --> 13:58.119
had stolen a couple
hundred thousand dollars
in jade

13:58.188 --> 13:59.917
from a local
Buddhist temple.

14:02.659 --> 14:05.492
He told Eddie to cover him
while he went in the CP
to look for it,

14:05.562 --> 14:07.029
except he told Eddie

14:07.364 --> 14:11.027
that it was intelligence
papers he was looking for.

14:13.136 --> 14:16.799
Well, we were all
sitting there in the Huey

14:16.873 --> 14:20.240
when Tyler comes running out
with a big burlap bag
in his hand

14:20.310 --> 14:23.074
and a candy-eating grin
on his face.

14:23.747 --> 14:27.239
And Eddie,
he just stayed there,

14:27.450 --> 14:30.248
and covered Tyler
all the way back
to the chopper.

14:35.091 --> 14:37.218
And that's when
it all hit the fan.

14:37.294 --> 14:39.990
Tyler got shot in the head
and they grabbed Eddie.

14:40.063 --> 14:44.659
This Vietnamese captain
and two others, they had
been hiding behind the CP.

14:47.804 --> 14:49.396
We couldn't shoot.

14:50.473 --> 14:51.770
It was dark.

14:52.776 --> 14:54.505
It was raining again.

14:55.879 --> 14:58.074
And this captain, he just...

14:59.482 --> 15:00.847
Iooked at us

15:01.318 --> 15:03.183
sitting there in the chopper.

15:03.987 --> 15:05.579
And he knew
we ripped him off.

15:05.655 --> 15:08.886
And he knew
there wasn't a damn thing
he could do about it.

15:12.696 --> 15:14.357
But he had Eddie.

15:18.568 --> 15:20.536
So he took out his pistol,

15:22.239 --> 15:23.729
smiled,

15:24.875 --> 15:26.900
and blew Eddie's head off.

15:31.648 --> 15:34.082
I'll always remember
the look on his face.

15:38.021 --> 15:40.717
Eddie Miller's?
No.

15:44.127 --> 15:45.719
The captain's.

15:48.732 --> 15:50.461
He's a Major now.

15:54.337 --> 15:58.330
I didn't put it all together
till he smiled.

16:00.543 --> 16:02.511
But he's the same man

16:03.380 --> 16:05.848
who's torturing
Tyler McKinney, right now.

16:09.352 --> 16:11.912
Then Tyler is here to atone.

16:17.494 --> 16:19.359
How do you know that?

16:20.664 --> 16:23.098
Because I was not
at Cam Ly.

16:52.086 --> 16:53.986
Turn over, Tyler.

16:55.849 --> 16:59.307
You must, or you'll
swallow your own blood
and suffocate on it.

17:00.053 --> 17:03.489
I remember a very similar
occurrence once.
Higgins,

17:03.990 --> 17:07.550
let me die in peace,
will you?
Come on, Tyler.
You're not dead yet.

17:07.727 --> 17:09.319
Turn over!

17:11.131 --> 17:13.691
Come on, Tyler.
Come on.

17:20.473 --> 17:22.202
Thanks.

17:23.877 --> 17:27.869
I did lie to you guys,
but not like you think.

17:29.115 --> 17:32.380
I brought you
to this hole
for something else.

17:32.452 --> 17:34.079
Save your breath, Tyler.

17:34.154 --> 17:35.451
Something else.

17:35.522 --> 17:37.422
You don't have much left.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.086
I'll go next.

17:45.198 --> 17:47.564
I don't think
it's up to you, Higgins.

17:51.938 --> 17:52.962
Who...

17:53.039 --> 17:55.098
Silence.

17:56.176 --> 17:58.371
These guys here, Magnum,

17:58.811 --> 18:01.609
they're the something else
I was talking about.

18:01.714 --> 18:03.477
McKinney.

18:04.350 --> 18:06.341
What took you so long?

18:07.353 --> 18:09.514
Welcome to Cambodia,
gentlemen.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.386
Welcome to the resistance.

18:17.830 --> 18:19.525
What matter?

18:19.799 --> 18:22.962
Well, first the good news.
There is hydraulic fluid here.

18:23.069 --> 18:26.266
The bad news is
most of it's in my face.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.330
Get me a wipe.

18:29.609 --> 18:30.837
A wipe?

18:31.377 --> 18:33.538
A rag. A towel. Something.

18:37.550 --> 18:39.450
Come on, hurry up.
Get me anything.

19:00.807 --> 19:04.004
I'm sorry.
Sorry I jumped
down your throat.

19:06.012 --> 19:07.604
That impossible.

19:08.248 --> 19:11.308
No, I mean, I yelled.
Yelled.

19:12.452 --> 19:14.079
Talk loudly.

19:14.153 --> 19:17.145
Ah, no problem.

19:19.425 --> 19:21.518
I guess I got
a lot on my mind.

19:22.295 --> 19:24.923
I mean, you're being
a lot of help to me, Joe.

19:25.031 --> 19:28.933
Thank you.
You know, one day
I want to be like you.

19:29.035 --> 19:30.662
Fly.

19:30.903 --> 19:34.430
Then I can fly away
from here. Be free.

19:35.575 --> 19:37.133
What do you mean?

19:37.410 --> 19:39.105
You're not free?

19:39.178 --> 19:43.615
I mean, you guys
got your crops,
your rice and stuff, right?

19:44.017 --> 19:45.917
Very little rice.

19:48.154 --> 19:49.951
Poppy.

19:50.857 --> 19:54.258
What do you mean?
Poppy.

20:01.734 --> 20:03.861
Poppy.
Right.

20:03.936 --> 20:06.598
That what I tell you.
Very bad.

20:07.473 --> 20:11.500
Sometime Vietnamese come,
if we don't have poppy...

20:12.845 --> 20:14.676
How is your progress?

20:15.348 --> 20:16.838
Oh, we're getting there.

20:16.916 --> 20:18.076
Maybe.

20:19.085 --> 20:23.613
It will indeed be a miracle
if you can make a car fly.

20:24.090 --> 20:26.251
Good luck.
Thanks.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.436
T. C: What'd he say?

20:43.309 --> 20:44.742
Um...

20:45.645 --> 20:49.604
Suragit say, American crazy.

20:50.216 --> 20:52.150
He say I waste my time.

20:56.289 --> 20:58.382
Do you think you are, Joe?

20:58.458 --> 21:01.359
I think I waste my time
if I don't help you.

21:41.934 --> 21:44.061
Don Young.

22:11.998 --> 22:15.957
That man should be dead.
Except he's much too
mean to give anybody...

22:16.469 --> 22:18.334
the satisfaction.

22:19.305 --> 22:22.968
At least, Magnum,
your suspicions about him
proved groundless.

22:23.342 --> 22:26.140
Tyler is not here
for Major Tu's opium.

22:26.479 --> 22:28.845
Perhaps we are
here for the MIA.
Oh...

22:28.915 --> 22:31.076
Come on, Higgins,
there's no MIA.

22:31.150 --> 22:34.483
And with J.J. Dead,
that means he came here
to kill Major Tu.

22:34.554 --> 22:35.816
So we can all
clap our hands

22:35.888 --> 22:38.118
and forgive him
for Cam Ly?
Well, I ain't buying it.

22:38.191 --> 22:39.453
That is good.

22:39.792 --> 22:42.090
Because the reason
Tyler McKinney is here,

22:42.161 --> 22:45.858
and presumably you too,
gentlemen, is me.

22:47.633 --> 22:48.793
You?

22:48.901 --> 22:50.835
Tyler has not
told you about me?

22:50.903 --> 22:54.361
Tyler McKinney
has not told us
a lot of things.

22:54.440 --> 22:56.465
Because of him,
we had to leave
a good buddy

22:56.542 --> 22:58.407
across the border
with a bullet in his chest

22:58.478 --> 23:00.275
and now we don't know
whether he's alive or dead.

23:00.346 --> 23:01.904
But with all due respect,
Doctor,

23:01.981 --> 23:03.380
and thank you very much
for saving us,

23:03.449 --> 23:05.576
we're gonna go back
and get him.

23:05.651 --> 23:07.983
Well, perhaps,
I can be of some help.

23:08.087 --> 23:10.817
You see,
my name is Long Tang.
Doctor Long Tang.

23:11.057 --> 23:13.150
I am the provisional president
of a confederation

23:13.226 --> 23:14.659
of democratic
resistance groups

23:14.727 --> 23:17.719
to the Vietnamese
and Khmer Rouge rape
of our country.

23:19.699 --> 23:21.564
In other words,

23:22.635 --> 23:26.594
he's the George freaking
Washington of Cambodia.

23:27.707 --> 23:29.902
And we're here
to get him the hell out.

23:29.976 --> 23:33.207
In order to establish
a government in exile
in a neutral country.

23:33.279 --> 23:37.181
Why on earth didn't you
tell us all this
back in Honolulu?

23:37.817 --> 23:39.682
'Cause you'd have
still been there.

23:40.586 --> 23:44.044
So you used J.J.
Instead of the truth.
- Yeah.

23:44.490 --> 23:46.958
But it doesn't
make any difference.

23:47.260 --> 23:50.696
You see, I loved J.J.
Just as much as you did,
Magnum.

23:51.197 --> 23:53.688
And you, Higgins,
you didn't even know him.

23:54.734 --> 23:56.998
I think it's about time
we stop putting conditions

23:57.069 --> 24:01.870
on the words
"freedom" and "commitment."
You live them or you don't.

24:03.709 --> 24:06.439
And that's why
we're here.
And the action.

24:06.846 --> 24:10.577
Yeah. Only right now
the action hurts
too damn much.

24:12.385 --> 24:13.852
The fact of the matter is,

24:13.920 --> 24:16.616
I was asked
a couple of months ago
to get the Doc out.

24:16.689 --> 24:19.783
Strictly freelance,
strictly off the record.

24:20.660 --> 24:23.493
J.J. And me went in,
got set up.

24:23.563 --> 24:25.724
The Doc's boys
came blazing out
of the jungle

24:25.798 --> 24:27.857
just as we were
about to buy it.

24:27.934 --> 24:31.199
The Major shot J.J.
Just as we were gonna
blow the scene.

24:32.038 --> 24:33.835
I barely made it out.

24:34.507 --> 24:37.203
And yeah,
you don't have to say it,

24:37.944 --> 24:40.242
just like Cam Ly.

24:42.315 --> 24:43.805
What now?

24:46.452 --> 24:49.285
We finish the job.
We get the doctor out.

24:49.388 --> 24:50.821
What about Tu?

24:50.890 --> 24:53.950
You tell me, Tyler.
Which is more important?

24:56.295 --> 24:58.422
Quickly, back in the tunnel.

25:17.249 --> 25:18.944
My God, man, hurry.

26:03.362 --> 26:04.829
She was my wife.

26:08.634 --> 26:10.295
She was my wife.

26:15.975 --> 26:17.237
Had enough?

26:26.085 --> 26:29.452
T. C: You know, Joe,
I think we might
just have ourselves

26:29.522 --> 26:31.513
a working fuel pump here.

26:36.796 --> 26:38.423
The only question is,

26:39.131 --> 26:41.258
do we have enough fuel?

26:41.667 --> 26:42.861
Fool?

26:43.803 --> 26:44.861
Fuel.

26:45.171 --> 26:46.502
Yes, fool.

26:47.440 --> 26:48.839
Who know?

26:49.608 --> 26:52.406
Well, the way
we're gonna find out,

26:54.780 --> 26:56.805
is by draining
this fuel tank.

27:06.759 --> 27:07.817
There.

27:09.729 --> 27:12.698
Which right now consists
of a bunch of foo...

27:13.866 --> 27:14.924
fuel,

27:15.000 --> 27:16.695
a bunch of water
and other gunk

27:16.769 --> 27:19.704
that has seeped in there
over the past 10 years.

27:20.406 --> 27:22.101
Hopefully find a chamois

27:22.341 --> 27:25.333
to soak up some of this water
and other sediment,

27:25.411 --> 27:28.209
and leave us
with a relatively pure
couple of gallons

27:28.280 --> 27:31.078
that will get us
the heck out of this dump.

27:32.351 --> 27:34.979
I mean, your village.
Hey, man, I'm sorry.

27:35.654 --> 27:37.019
No problem.

27:38.157 --> 27:40.182
I want to get out
of here, too.

27:40.926 --> 27:44.089
I want to go to America
and learn to fly

27:44.597 --> 27:46.155
and learn to be free.

27:46.232 --> 27:47.426
Yeah, well,

27:47.500 --> 27:51.527
no one's going anywhere
unless I figure out
how to soak up this water.

27:51.637 --> 27:54.902
You wouldn't happen
to have a Sears around here,
would you?

27:55.174 --> 27:57.665
No. Instead,
I have yak hide.

27:59.278 --> 28:01.303
You mean rawhide? Cow?

28:02.314 --> 28:05.408
Yak. Yak. Buffalo.

28:07.419 --> 28:08.852
I get yak hide.

28:08.921 --> 28:11.446
We get water,
then water free.

28:11.524 --> 28:13.617
Then fool free. Me free.

28:13.692 --> 28:16.252
You free, we all free!
All right.

28:18.931 --> 28:20.523
Be right back!

28:21.667 --> 28:23.066
Oh.

28:23.135 --> 28:24.295
Sorry.

28:24.603 --> 28:27.128
- How you feel?
- Oh, just great.

28:28.007 --> 28:29.998
I'm not gonna die.
Good.

28:32.444 --> 28:34.776
How's your shoulder?
Hurts.

28:35.414 --> 28:37.177
Anything from Thomas?

28:37.249 --> 28:39.217
No, not yet.

28:42.321 --> 28:45.051
I'm sorry, man.
I'm just trying to get
this thing working.

28:45.124 --> 28:46.455
No problem.

28:46.692 --> 28:47.852
Hey,

28:47.927 --> 28:51.090
did you see Suragit,
Nata Ying's old man?

28:51.163 --> 28:52.221
No.

28:53.132 --> 28:55.794
Wait a minute.
You're not thinking
what I think you're thinking.

28:55.868 --> 28:57.199
Why not?

28:57.269 --> 28:59.499
Because...
Ain't it something?

28:59.572 --> 29:02.166
Yeah, it's something.
Just think, T.C.,

29:02.741 --> 29:05.938
I could teach her English.
She could work in the club.

29:06.312 --> 29:09.110
Hey, maybe even get a job
as a nurse or something.

29:09.181 --> 29:12.309
Consider the possibilities.
No, you consider
the possibilities.

29:12.384 --> 29:14.818
I already did.
No, you didn't.

29:14.887 --> 29:18.653
Hey, don't you try
and talk me out of something
that I really wanna do now.

29:18.724 --> 29:20.123
Something that's
really right.

29:20.192 --> 29:23.320
Something that's crazy?
Maybe to you, T.C.

29:23.395 --> 29:25.363
You just don't know her.

29:26.365 --> 29:28.196
Now, look what you're doing.

29:28.267 --> 29:30.701
You know,
I don't really care
what you think,

29:30.769 --> 29:31.827
but one way or the other,

29:31.904 --> 29:33.269
baby and I
are gonna have
the biggest wedding

29:33.339 --> 29:34.806
Honolulu's ever seen.

29:37.376 --> 29:38.968
Just think
about the fireworks.

30:38.137 --> 30:39.502
Long Tang!

30:51.517 --> 30:52.984
I love it!

31:10.636 --> 31:13.537
Come on, Higgins, let's go.
Quite.

31:15.975 --> 31:17.272
Move!

31:56.582 --> 31:58.812
I do not know you
very well, Magnum.

31:59.551 --> 32:01.212
But, from what I see,

32:01.286 --> 32:04.414
I do not think
you were taken in
by Tyler McKinney.

32:06.392 --> 32:08.917
He out and out lied, Doctor.
He didn't have to.

32:08.994 --> 32:10.586
Perhaps,

32:10.662 --> 32:13.893
but the lie in itself
was one based on a truth.

32:14.500 --> 32:16.525
And I think that
that truth is one

32:16.602 --> 32:19.969
that you and he
and your friends
ultimately share.

32:20.739 --> 32:21.933
What truth is that?

32:22.574 --> 32:24.872
The most basic one
of them all,

32:26.145 --> 32:28.045
the belief in freedom.

32:29.848 --> 32:33.215
Sometimes I think
people just have
to be reminded of it.

32:35.487 --> 32:39.014
And sometimes it doesn't
particularly matter how.

32:43.262 --> 32:44.559
Thank you.

33:11.190 --> 33:12.782
Rick. Rick.

33:12.858 --> 33:14.758
No, no, no.

33:17.396 --> 33:18.658
Everything okay?

33:18.730 --> 33:19.958
I don't know.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.899
T. C: Joe's still
out there working.

33:23.035 --> 33:24.332
Yeah.

33:29.308 --> 33:30.775
I wanna ask you something.

33:31.110 --> 33:32.202
What?

33:32.277 --> 33:35.041
I was thinking about
our talk and everything,

33:36.215 --> 33:37.580
about you and the girl.

33:39.485 --> 33:40.747
What about her?

33:40.819 --> 33:42.309
Nothing, nothing.

33:42.888 --> 33:45.880
I was just wondering
who you were thinking about

33:45.958 --> 33:47.721
to be your best man.

33:49.495 --> 33:51.087
All you guys, I guess.
I mean...

33:51.163 --> 33:53.063
You mean Magnum
and Higgins, too?

33:54.233 --> 33:55.461
Sure.

33:57.436 --> 33:59.063
How do you figure that,
Rick?

34:00.606 --> 34:02.506
What are you talking about?

34:02.574 --> 34:04.405
Do you see Magnum
and Higgins here?

34:05.611 --> 34:07.738
You just see me
and you and...

34:08.045 --> 34:10.606
We're sitting here
in the middle
of the damn jungle

34:10.681 --> 34:14.139
with you all shot up and me
with less than half a chance
of getting us out of here

34:14.219 --> 34:15.686
and you aren't even
considering the fact

34:15.754 --> 34:18.723
that Magnum and Higgins
might not be coming back.

34:18.790 --> 34:20.087
Or are you?

34:21.659 --> 34:24.356
I don't know.
I don't like to think
about stuff like that.

34:24.429 --> 34:27.023
Well, you've got to.
You can't come
into a situation like this

34:27.099 --> 34:29.795
without thinking
about stuff like that.

34:30.101 --> 34:32.002
I mean, if you don't,
it's just,

34:32.070 --> 34:35.301
it's just dumb
and you don't deserve...
Oh, no, no, no.

34:35.541 --> 34:38.009
You don't have the right
to do stuff

34:38.076 --> 34:40.043
like falling in love
and proposing to chicks

34:40.112 --> 34:42.545
who can't understand
a word of what we're saying.

34:42.614 --> 34:44.741
I mean,
it's dumb and it's wrong.

34:44.815 --> 34:47.717
She understands.
Maybe not in English,
but she understands.

34:47.786 --> 34:50.186
No, no, no.
What she understands

34:50.255 --> 34:53.815
is that a nice guy
with a nice smile
got shot up pretty bad,

34:54.193 --> 34:57.458
and she was able to help out
and he was nice to her.

34:57.529 --> 35:00.623
Maybe offered
her a chance
at something better,

35:00.699 --> 35:02.189
something new,

35:02.267 --> 35:06.260
something different
than the ordinariness
of her day-to-day life.

35:09.041 --> 35:12.568
But it's not reality
and you've got
to realize that, Rick.

35:13.145 --> 35:15.545
You can't take her
back to Hawaii.

35:15.681 --> 35:17.649
I mean,
it's not fair to her.

35:18.016 --> 35:20.177
And then what?
Are you going to
teach her English,

35:20.252 --> 35:22.049
or is she going
to teach you Thai?

35:23.055 --> 35:25.580
And when you can
talk to each other,

35:25.657 --> 35:29.252
where is the guarantee
that you're going to even like
what each other are saying?

35:35.367 --> 35:37.528
Look, you do
what you gotta do.

35:49.514 --> 35:51.744
Maybe your friend
come back today.

35:51.817 --> 35:53.011
Maybe.

35:53.352 --> 35:55.820
At any rate,
we got to be ready for them.

35:56.221 --> 35:58.746
We got to be ready
to leave right away.

35:58.957 --> 36:00.049
We?

36:01.093 --> 36:02.321
Yeah, we.

36:02.995 --> 36:04.929
You want freedom,
Joe, baby?

36:05.297 --> 36:07.663
I'm gonna see
that you get a shot at it.

36:08.333 --> 36:09.561
Come on.

37:13.632 --> 37:15.099
Yeah!

37:42.928 --> 37:44.862
You guys made it.

37:52.504 --> 37:53.869
I'm sorry.

37:56.074 --> 37:57.564
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

38:04.249 --> 38:05.511
No J. J?

38:11.089 --> 38:13.523
That's the man
that J.J. Died for.

38:21.099 --> 38:22.259
What's he saying?

38:22.334 --> 38:25.394
He's thanking
the Thai villagers
for their support

38:25.470 --> 38:27.461
in his, and all the people's
in the region,

38:27.539 --> 38:29.370
struggle for freedom.

38:29.574 --> 38:31.405
His name is Long Tang.

38:32.077 --> 38:33.874
You mean he's
kind of like...

38:33.945 --> 38:36.004
George freaking Washington.
George freaking Washington.

38:36.081 --> 38:38.015
If we get him
out of here in time.

38:38.083 --> 38:39.607
What are you
talking about?
Nothing,

38:39.684 --> 38:41.743
other than I've been
thinking about the fact

38:41.820 --> 38:45.051
that twice you sneaked
into that refugee camp

38:45.123 --> 38:47.887
and both times Major Tu
was waiting for you.

38:47.959 --> 38:50.223
Now,
if he knew we were coming
in the first place,

38:50.295 --> 38:52.456
he's got to know
where we're running to.

38:52.531 --> 38:54.829
Personally, I'd feel
a lot better in Bangkok.

38:54.900 --> 38:56.424
Or Chicago.
Or...

38:58.236 --> 38:59.760
Long Tang!

40:06.471 --> 40:08.496
T.C.,
I can't fly in chopper.

40:08.573 --> 40:10.768
Well, I'll make room.
That not point.

40:11.276 --> 40:12.607
What is the point?

40:12.677 --> 40:15.407
Point is
Long Tang is great man.

40:15.814 --> 40:18.544
He say that one man
cannot be truly free

40:18.617 --> 40:20.312
if all men are not.

40:21.219 --> 40:23.312
If I go to Hawaii with you,

40:23.822 --> 40:25.653
I will not really be free.

40:26.791 --> 40:28.656
I must stay here
and fight for it.

40:44.576 --> 40:47.602
Maybe...
Maybe I see you later.

41:04.095 --> 41:07.121
Well, Magnum, I think
we're gonna get out
in one piece.

41:07.766 --> 41:09.563
Mission accomplished.

41:09.868 --> 41:11.358
The right one.

41:14.172 --> 41:15.833
You know,
I left that other
crate of stuff

41:15.907 --> 41:18.068
that we brought
upriver for these guys,

41:18.677 --> 41:21.009
you know,
for when the Viets get here,

41:22.414 --> 41:24.644
which ought to be
anytime now.

41:26.017 --> 41:28.110
They're gonna get wiped out.

41:29.054 --> 41:30.885
Well, I guess
that's just the price

41:30.956 --> 41:33.550
we're gonna have to pay
for getting Long Tang out.

41:41.433 --> 41:42.923
The hell it is.

41:44.202 --> 41:45.999
Out of sight.

42:07.425 --> 42:09.325
Come on, come on.

42:29.648 --> 42:31.582
Come on, boys, come on.

42:39.290 --> 42:40.723
Hey, Tyler,

42:41.593 --> 42:44.892
think you'll ever be able
to cope with world peace?

42:47.298 --> 42:49.528
I doubt
if I'll ever have to.

43:05.250 --> 43:08.242
Keep coming, baby.
You're mine.

43:19.964 --> 43:21.056
Joe, no.

43:25.370 --> 43:26.496
Nuts.

44:33.304 --> 44:35.204
Time to go
pay my respects.
Cover me.

44:35.273 --> 44:36.968
No, you cover me!

45:20.819 --> 45:23.583
Cam Ly. Cam Ly.

45:29.627 --> 45:30.821
Tyler!

46:04.762 --> 46:06.286
It's all right.

46:08.199 --> 46:09.689
It's all right.

46:18.977 --> 46:21.468
It's not all right,
not in the least.

46:21.546 --> 46:23.673
As a matter of fact,
in the time we've been away,

46:23.748 --> 46:26.376
the estate has completely
gone to pot.

46:26.517 --> 46:29.509
Unpaid bills,
unread correspondence,

46:30.088 --> 46:31.350
underfed lads.

46:31.422 --> 46:34.721
Yeah, well,
the assistant manager really
messed things up at the club.

46:34.792 --> 46:37.590
We're stuck with 300
extra pounds of mahi-mahi.

46:39.063 --> 46:42.260
Well, I missed three
seven-island charter flights

46:43.201 --> 46:45.362
and one little league
playoff game.

46:45.703 --> 46:48.331
How did your kids do?
They won.

46:50.308 --> 46:52.242
What if we hadn't have gone?

47:05.356 --> 47:06.550
We did.

47:19.037 --> 47:21.267
<i>Maybe Long Tang was right.</i>

47:21.773 --> 47:25.834
<i>We wound up going</i>
<i>to Chong Ker and Ban Li</i>
<i>for that most basic truth,</i>

47:26.577 --> 47:27.703
<i>freedom.</i>

47:27.946 --> 47:30.141
<i>But did Tyler? I don't know.</i>

47:30.214 --> 47:32.307
<i>Ultimately, it didn't matter.</i>

47:32.417 --> 47:35.580
<i>What mattered was</i>
<i>we were faithful</i>
<i>to that truth,</i>

47:36.754 --> 47:39.450
<i>and so was</i>
<i>Tyler Peabody McKinney.</i>
