WEBVTT

00:07.049 --> 00:09.425
My name is Wolverine.

00:09.593 --> 00:15.431
I'm the best there is at what l do.
But what l do isn't very nice.

00:26.443 --> 00:28.277
What the. ..?

00:47.548 --> 00:50.466
What the hell happened?

01:09.570 --> 01:11.571
Oh, yeah.

02:35.239 --> 02:38.199
Sir, l know l'm not supposed
to ask questions...

02:38.367 --> 02:39.700
...but who are you?

02:43.914 --> 02:46.415
No one you wanna know, kid.

03:08.063 --> 03:10.231
Looks like someone had a bad day.

03:15.028 --> 03:18.239
Copy.
We're still searching for any survivors.

03:22.244 --> 03:25.079
lt happened about four hours ago,
just before dawn.

03:25.247 --> 03:28.833
The creature was sighted
crossing the U.S.-Canadian border.

03:29.001 --> 03:32.128
This is what happened
when it reached civilization.

03:32.296 --> 03:33.671
Creature?

03:33.839 --> 03:38.217
The Americans call it "the Hulk."
lntel's sketchy.

03:38.385 --> 03:41.596
Department H thinks the U.S. military
is covering something up.

03:59.156 --> 04:01.908
lt smells toxic.

04:02.451 --> 04:03.951
Gunpowder too.

04:04.119 --> 04:07.622
WelI, someone tried to fight back.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.836
Guess they didn't fight hard enough.

04:14.004 --> 04:16.339
Department H wants you to find
and stop the Hulk. ..

04:16.505 --> 04:18.673
...before he reaches another town
or city.

04:19.051 --> 04:21.010
And if you can't stop it, kiIl it.

04:23.055 --> 04:25.514
Sounds Iike fun.

04:39.029 --> 04:41.197
Sir, l think we got something.

04:46.620 --> 04:50.581
-Do you want us to try for a landing?
-Don't bother.

06:45.489 --> 06:47.448
What--? What was that?

06:48.492 --> 06:49.658
Hey, bub.

06:52.162 --> 06:56.457
You haven't seen a big monster
running around anywhere, have you?

06:57.250 --> 06:58.834
No. Stay back.

06:59.002 --> 07:02.213
Stay away from me. Stay back.

07:03.965 --> 07:08.177
Relax, crybaby. I ain't gonna--

07:12.182 --> 07:14.183
You smell toxic.

07:20.524 --> 07:22.358
Who are you?

07:22.526 --> 07:25.986
Please, l'm begging you,
leave me alone.

07:26.154 --> 07:30.491
For your own sake, please, go.
You're in terrible danger.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.955
Here's the deal, misty.

07:36.123 --> 07:38.040
There's a third claw
that's gonna come out...

07:38.208 --> 07:39.500
...if you don't start talking.

07:57.561 --> 07:59.562
Oh, heIl.

08:00.063 --> 08:02.898
l don't suppose you got any interest
in talking this out.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.373
What the hell happened?

08:26.506 --> 08:28.716
Oh, yeah.

08:30.594 --> 08:32.553
Let's do this.

08:33.263 --> 08:34.429
Come on.

09:44.584 --> 09:47.002
Hulk smash little man.

09:47.170 --> 09:51.715
Little man, leave Hulk alone.

09:54.302 --> 10:00.099
Hulk is strongest there is!

10:32.465 --> 10:37.469
Okay, bub. Let's try that again.

11:26.353 --> 11:27.895
Thanks, runt.

11:28.063 --> 11:31.023
We've been trying to take him down
for weeks.

11:31.191 --> 11:34.109
Logan, buddy, it's me, Deadpool.

11:34.277 --> 11:36.862
l shot you.

11:51.628 --> 11:53.462
What are you looking at?

11:59.719 --> 12:03.806
Prepare the lab. We're on our way.

12:07.977 --> 12:11.438
His vital signs are increasing.
He's waking up.

12:18.154 --> 12:22.324
Now, Miss Hines, begin
the adamantium bonding process.

12:22.492 --> 12:24.952
-Yes, professor.
-Commencing infusion.

12:34.045 --> 12:37.089
-His vitals are erratic but holding.
-Excellent.

12:37.257 --> 12:40.092
lncrease to maximum.

13:16.129 --> 13:20.382
Weapon X's mental conditioning
and reprogramming are at stage five.

13:20.550 --> 13:22.551
Begin combat assessment.

13:32.395 --> 13:34.605
l don't care how long you've had him,
professor.

13:34.772 --> 13:38.192
This is a mistake.
l know him. He can't be controlled.

13:38.359 --> 13:41.069
You have his DNA,
so just let me kill him.

13:41.237 --> 13:44.781
l'll take that under advisement,
Sabretooth.

13:44.949 --> 13:49.328
-Prepare your team for the mission.
-Your funeral.

14:01.257 --> 14:05.594
What do you say after the mission,
we kill all those floating babies?

14:05.762 --> 14:08.180
Do you ever shut up, Wilson?

14:08.765 --> 14:11.767
What? Babies creep me out.

14:19.651 --> 14:21.902
He's fighting the programming.

14:22.779 --> 14:26.281
We are losing control.
lncrease the dosage.

14:26.449 --> 14:31.036
lnitiate lockdown procedures.
And someone activate Sabretooth.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.671
Guards! Guards!

15:12.036 --> 15:15.038
Wakey-wakey time.

15:15.999 --> 15:18.625
Logan, we missed you.

15:18.793 --> 15:21.336
And Weapon X just hasn't been
the same without you.

15:21.504 --> 15:23.922
Nobody calIs me "bub" anymore.

15:24.090 --> 15:26.341
And Omega Red's a bed wetter.

15:28.511 --> 15:33.473
One day l will tear out
your flippant tongue, Wilson.

15:34.642 --> 15:37.060
He's very ashamed.

15:37.854 --> 15:40.063
Despite Deadpool's idiocy...

15:40.231 --> 15:43.817
...Weapon X is indeed pleased
to have you back, Logan.

15:43.985 --> 15:46.778
We put considerable time
and money into you.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.322
And pointy things.

15:48.489 --> 15:51.533
You were our best operative,
Wolverine.

15:51.701 --> 15:53.827
So disappointing.

15:53.995 --> 15:56.038
But you did lead us to Dr. Banner.

15:56.205 --> 16:00.042
Of course,
you know him better as the Hulk.

16:00.209 --> 16:02.377
l shot him in the ass.
With one of these.

16:03.504 --> 16:05.047
What? I did.

16:05.214 --> 16:08.550
Weapon X has been pursuing the Hulk
for weeks.

16:26.319 --> 16:30.364
Unfortunately,
there was some collateral damage.

16:30.531 --> 16:33.825
lf only Department H
had sent you in sooner.. .

16:33.993 --> 16:37.579
...who knows how much destruction
could have been avoided?

16:37.747 --> 16:39.706
What do you want with the Hulk?

16:40.083 --> 16:42.751
We just wanna help him
find his happy place.

16:42.919 --> 16:44.628
Did you see how angry he was?

16:44.796 --> 16:47.923
l mean, l'm sorry, but come on.

16:48.091 --> 16:51.259
l think his pants are too tight--

16:52.595 --> 16:55.639
We want the same thing
we wanted with you, Logan:

16:55.807 --> 16:57.140
a weapon.

16:57.308 --> 17:00.477
l'll erase Banner's memories
and reprogram him. ..

17:00.645 --> 17:02.437
...just like l did you.

17:02.605 --> 17:03.855
And then Weapon X. ..

17:04.022 --> 17:07.651
...will have the most powerful creature
on the planet. ..

17:07.819 --> 17:09.778
...at our disposaI.

17:11.531 --> 17:14.407
You should've kiIled me
when you had the chance. ..

17:14.575 --> 17:16.785
...because l'm gonna get out of here...

17:16.953 --> 17:19.121
... l'm gonna kilI all of them. ..

17:19.288 --> 17:22.915
...and then l'm gonna cut out
your heart.

17:25.627 --> 17:29.131
Wolverine, after l'm done with you.. .

17:29.298 --> 17:32.134
...you won't even remember
this conversation.

17:32.301 --> 17:36.805
l've erased your life before,
and l'm going to do it again.

17:36.973 --> 17:41.226
AlI you'll know
is that you belong to Weapon X.. .

17:41.394 --> 17:45.021
...now and forever.

17:47.817 --> 17:49.276
Oh, that is so not cool.

17:51.863 --> 17:53.280
l hate that guy.

17:55.533 --> 17:58.785
Wolverine, you look so sad.

17:58.953 --> 18:02.998
Hey, if it makes you feel any better,
Lady Deathstrike tried to kill you...

18:03.166 --> 18:04.458
...while you were asleep.

18:04.625 --> 18:08.837
-Better than having to listen to you.
-Man, does she hate you.

18:09.005 --> 18:10.505
l mean, we all hate you.. .

18:10.673 --> 18:15.594
...but Deathstrike really, really,
really hates you.

18:15.762 --> 18:19.347
Hey,
stilI have that unbreakable skull?

18:22.018 --> 18:23.602
Damn it.

18:32.028 --> 18:34.988
You will die today, Logan-san.

18:38.826 --> 18:42.954
lt does not matter
what the Professor says.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.832
These are your last breaths.

18:56.177 --> 18:57.886
What are you doing here, Deathstrike?

18:58.054 --> 19:00.722
l'm about to start
Wolverine's reprogramming.

19:00.890 --> 19:02.557
He has to die.

19:02.725 --> 19:06.603
How many times do l have to have
this conversation with you?

19:06.771 --> 19:08.522
He's more valuabIe alive than--

19:21.828 --> 19:25.747
Sorry, Prof.
Gotta go with the lady on this one.

19:52.567 --> 19:55.110
You've gotta love our healing factors.

19:55.278 --> 19:59.489
l'm gonna enjoy killing you for days.

19:59.657 --> 20:04.286
And then l think we'll drop the HuIk
on an orphanage or something...

20:04.453 --> 20:07.038
...just for fun.

20:07.957 --> 20:10.125
Gaijin dog.

20:10.293 --> 20:15.297
For the dishonor you caused
my family, you will suffer.

20:15.464 --> 20:18.466
And then you will die.

20:19.969 --> 20:24.806
Sweetheart, you and your family
can take your honor...

20:24.974 --> 20:28.101
...and shove it up your bony little--

20:30.271 --> 20:32.105
Deathstrike, don't!

21:22.990 --> 21:27.035
Target Iocated in Zone 23.
Take him down.

21:41.550 --> 21:44.052
Backup. We need backup!

21:56.232 --> 21:57.273
WelI, he's alive. ..

21:57.441 --> 22:00.902
...but I think he's gonna need
some serious TLC.

22:01.070 --> 22:04.406
The last thing the Professor said
before the runt gutted him...

22:04.573 --> 22:07.242
...was for us to kill Wolverine.

22:07.410 --> 22:09.244
Really?

22:09.870 --> 22:11.246
Do you buy that?

22:11.414 --> 22:15.000
Yeah, you know, l would think the
last thing he said was, "Sabretooth!"

22:15.167 --> 22:19.421
We kilI WoIverine now.
That is aIl that matters.

22:19.588 --> 22:22.757
Whatever you say, ponytail.
Who am I to say no to a little murder?

22:23.384 --> 22:25.260
Strike a pose.

22:51.871 --> 22:54.789
Get it together.
We're gonna have company soon.

22:55.458 --> 22:58.793
Please. Please, l'm begging you.

22:58.961 --> 23:02.213
You have to help me.
You have to get me out of here.

23:02.381 --> 23:05.050
lf these peopIe turn the Hulk
into a weapon...

23:05.217 --> 23:07.635
...millions of people will die.

23:07.803 --> 23:11.973
So l should just kill you now.
That's what you're saying, right?

23:13.267 --> 23:15.894
Come on, weepy.

23:20.483 --> 23:22.567
You don't know what it's like.

23:22.735 --> 23:24.986
l've been hunted
for as long as I can remember.

23:25.154 --> 23:27.655
And l can't control it. The monster, it--

23:27.823 --> 23:31.326
Bub, do l look like l give a--?

23:50.179 --> 23:52.931
Please, struggle.

23:53.099 --> 23:56.935
lt will make your death
taste so much sweeter.

23:58.437 --> 24:00.313
-No!
-Yes.

24:00.856 --> 24:03.316
As in, "Yes, you're going to die."

24:05.528 --> 24:07.278
l'm just kidding.

24:15.496 --> 24:20.542
No. That was my favorite gun.

24:24.672 --> 24:27.632
What the hell's the matter with you?
Do your thing.

24:27.800 --> 24:30.635
We need your big green friend
out here right freaking now.

24:30.803 --> 24:33.054
What? No.

24:35.057 --> 24:37.267
What do you mean, "no"?

24:37.434 --> 24:40.562
Even if that was a good idea, l can't.

24:40.729 --> 24:45.400
The transformation happens
when I feel angry or stressed.

24:45.568 --> 24:47.777
No, they must have drugged me.

24:47.945 --> 24:50.655
Something's suppressing
my adrenaline.

24:50.823 --> 24:53.074
lt comes from the cortex.

24:55.953 --> 24:59.164
Maybe that will help speed things up.

25:00.416 --> 25:04.419
lf you wanna cry now, I'd say go for it.

25:06.755 --> 25:09.215
End of the line, runt.

25:09.383 --> 25:11.593
Got any last words?

25:11.760 --> 25:14.512
Yeah, two.

25:21.353 --> 25:22.437
Let's dance.

25:29.904 --> 25:33.323
l've been waiting for this a long time.

25:33.782 --> 25:36.284
Yeah, weIl, you can keep waiting.

25:55.638 --> 25:58.932
Dude, that is just not cool.

26:01.310 --> 26:02.644
Look at that.

26:03.646 --> 26:05.146
Could you give me a hand?

26:05.314 --> 26:07.649
l'm kidding. All right, l'll go get it.

26:18.494 --> 26:22.747
There we go. No, that's not right.
What the hell?

26:26.794 --> 26:28.670
Oh, God, now it's upside down.

26:37.846 --> 26:41.015
There she is. Sweet.

27:09.878 --> 27:11.337
Gonna kiIl you.

27:30.232 --> 27:35.153
Hulk smash claw people.

28:11.607 --> 28:16.402
The next one will be
through your brain stem, Logan-san.

28:24.661 --> 28:26.704
Little man.

28:33.379 --> 28:37.215
Hey. Hey, hey, I'm on your side,
you flaming idiot.

28:49.686 --> 28:52.146
Hey, wait for me.

28:53.482 --> 28:56.734
Who wants snacks? You do.

28:58.529 --> 29:00.279
Logan, I think we lost him.

29:09.331 --> 29:13.000
And they lived happily ever after,
except the Hulk.

29:13.168 --> 29:16.337
Bub, you just made him angrier.

29:25.180 --> 29:28.349
Talking man hurt Hulk.

29:28.517 --> 29:33.521
Hulk rip off talking man's head!

29:35.023 --> 29:37.400
My head? Oh, crap.

29:37.568 --> 29:39.277
He's aIl yours, Einstein.

29:39.445 --> 29:43.406
No, Logan, we're friends. No. No!

30:01.175 --> 30:03.009
Ugly girl scratch HuIk.

31:51.994 --> 31:53.619
Go for it, big guy.

31:53.787 --> 31:56.998
Tear this whole godforsaken place
down to the ground.

32:00.669 --> 32:02.670
Do it.

32:25.736 --> 32:26.777
Great.

32:37.331 --> 32:41.292
AlI right, bub. Where were we?

36:34.776 --> 36:38.904
Guys? Red? Deathstrike?

36:39.614 --> 36:42.575
l can't believe it. I'm alive.
