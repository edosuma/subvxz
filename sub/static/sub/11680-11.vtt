00:04.134 --> 00:06.733
Man: we got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.367
<i>When you're burned,
you've got nothing -</i>

00:09.434 --> 00:12.034
<i>No cash, no credit, no job history.</i>

00:12.100 --> 00:14.434
<i>You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.</i>

00:14.501 --> 00:16.501
Where am i? Miami.

00:16.567 --> 00:19.701
<i>You do whatever work comes your way.</i>

00:19.768 --> 00:22.334
<i>You rely on anyone who's
still talking to you.</i>

00:22.401 --> 00:23.999
<i>A trigger-Happy ex-Girlfriend...</i>

00:24.000 --> 00:25.667
should we shoot them?

00:25.668 --> 00:28.134
<i>...an old friend who used to inform on you
to the fbi...</i>

00:28.200 --> 00:30.534
you know spies
A bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:30.601 --> 00:33.067
<i>...family, too... hey,
is that your mom again?</i>

00:33.134 --> 00:35.234
<i>...if you're desperate. Someone needs your
help, michael.</i>

00:35.301 --> 00:37.734
<i>Bottom line - As long
as you're burned,</i>

00:37.800 --> 00:41.534
<i>You're not going anywhere.</i>

00:47.100 --> 00:48.965
<i>In the intelligence community,</i>

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
<i>An invitation to meet at a hotel pool</i>

00:51.067 --> 00:52.266
<i>Is an olive branch.</i>

00:52.267 --> 00:53.832
<i>The person you're meeting</i>

00:53.833 --> 00:56.167
<i>Is offering you multiple
escape routes,</i>

00:56.234 --> 00:57.899
<i>A crowd to mix in with,</i>

00:57.900 --> 00:59.700
<i>And the virtual certainty</i>

00:59.701 --> 01:03.367
<i>That nobody is concealing a weapon in their
bathing suit.</i>

01:03.434 --> 01:05.367
<i>But if you're meeting the kind of guy</i>

01:05.434 --> 01:07.434
<i>Who arranges coup d'etats
for a living,</i>

01:07.501 --> 01:09.401
<i>It's still a good idea
to bring backup.</i>

01:09.436 --> 01:11.066
Champagne?

01:15.367 --> 01:17.033
Why don't we ever come to these places

01:17.034 --> 01:18.866
For anything other than surveillance?

01:18.867 --> 01:23.200
Michael: i'm not seeing anyone
who's obviously here for a meeting.

01:23.267 --> 01:25.334
I don't know why you're
willing to meet this gilroy.

01:25.401 --> 01:27.199
He sounds as bad as the
people who burned you.

01:27.200 --> 01:28.566
He's worse.

01:28.567 --> 01:30.967
As far as i know, they weren't
selling nuclear secrets

01:31.034 --> 01:32.633
To anyone who can write a check.

01:32.634 --> 01:33.966
If the price is right, fi,

01:33.967 --> 01:35.850
Gilroy will put anything on the table.

01:35.885 --> 01:37.733
Which makes this little rendezvous

01:37.734 --> 01:39.500
Not a very good idea, in my opinion.

01:39.501 --> 01:41.668
If he's here in miami,
he's planning something big.

01:41.734 --> 01:42.999
I need to find out what.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.234
Gilroy already killed your cia contact.

01:45.301 --> 01:47.201
That's exactly the point, fi.

01:48.534 --> 01:50.867
This man is a freelance psychopath.

01:50.933 --> 01:53.034
And i'm the only one in a position

01:53.100 --> 01:55.401
Who can do anything about it.

01:55.467 --> 01:57.367
Keep an eye out.

Westen.

02:21.367 --> 02:24.234
They say eyes are the windows to the soul,

02:24.301 --> 02:27.434
But i think hands tell you so much more.

02:27.501 --> 02:31.134
And you - You have a workingman's hands.

02:31.200 --> 02:33.434
Well, i've never been
afraid to get them dirty.

02:33.501 --> 02:35.366
So i've heard.

02:35.367 --> 02:38.100
The company man gone bad.

02:38.167 --> 02:40.634
I have to say, i find you quite fascinating.

02:40.701 --> 02:42.199
I bet you say that to all the girls.

02:42.200 --> 02:43.566
Only the ones i like.

02:43.567 --> 02:45.366
Well, i'm flattered. You should be.

02:45.367 --> 02:47.967
Most people bore me, especially americans -

02:48.034 --> 02:51.234
Always some structure to report to,
some memo to file.

02:51.301 --> 02:52.899
Everything in its proper box.

02:52.900 --> 02:55.434
For all your talk of rugged individualism,

02:55.501 --> 02:58.000
In my experience, this is a nation of sheep,

02:58.067 --> 03:00.401
Present company excepted, of course.

03:00.467 --> 03:01.700
Of course.

03:01.701 --> 03:03.417
And you? How do you like to operate?

03:03.452 --> 03:05.133
I see opportunities, and i take them.

03:05.134 --> 03:06.633
It's much simpler, much more fun.

03:06.634 --> 03:08.199
Sounds like we're a lot alike.

03:08.200 --> 03:10.100
An associate once told me that.

03:10.167 --> 03:11.166
Tom strickler.

03:11.167 --> 03:13.334
You know him, don't you?

03:13.401 --> 03:15.266
Oh, that's right - You shot him.

03:15.267 --> 03:17.200
I'm curious.

03:17.267 --> 03:20.867
What led to the actual...

03:20.933 --> 03:23.067
i did the work. He banked the cash.

03:23.134 --> 03:25.067
I just figured i'd eliminate the middleman.

03:25.134 --> 03:27.234
Eliminate him you did.

03:27.301 --> 03:30.034
Unfortunately, it made a certain cia agent

03:30.100 --> 03:32.301
Take an interest in strickler's business.

03:32.367 --> 03:34.501
<i>And since i was strickler's
business...</i>

03:34.567 --> 03:37.100
you arranged to have him fall
out of a fourth-Story window.

03:37.167 --> 03:38.733
Yes.

03:38.734 --> 03:41.067
It wasn't lost on me that
you showed up at the scene.

03:41.134 --> 03:42.366
Why was that?

03:42.367 --> 03:43.566
<i>He wasn't just your problem.</i>

03:43.567 --> 03:44.999
I was strickler's business, too.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.667
It sounds like we have a lot in common.

03:46.668 --> 03:47.799
Why don't we work together?

03:47.800 --> 03:48.899
Tempting.

03:48.900 --> 03:50.767
But you were quite the boy scout once.

03:50.768 --> 03:52.133
And the project i'm working on

03:52.134 --> 03:53.733
Is definitely not for boy scouts.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.634
Oh, believe me,
i've been there and done that,

03:55.668 --> 03:56.899
And i see where it gets you.

03:56.900 --> 03:58.733
That's why i live by a new code -

03:58.734 --> 04:00.400
50% up front.

04:00.401 --> 04:02.301
Hmm.

04:03.167 --> 04:05.067
I'm not sure i'm ready for that yet.

04:05.100 --> 04:06.767
I'm still getting to know you,

04:06.768 --> 04:09.000
Getting to know all about you...

04:09.067 --> 04:11.034
and your little girlfriend up there.

04:22.567 --> 04:24.467
Champagne's on me.

04:42.133 --> 04:43.967
What's going on here, sam?

04:43.968 --> 04:45.199
I'm moving, mike.

04:45.200 --> 04:46.733
You found a place.

04:46.734 --> 04:48.934
Yeah, sorta. I'm staying with
miss reynolds and her mom.

04:49.001 --> 04:50.968
Isn't she a little angry about -

04:51.034 --> 04:52.900
Well, the whole "car getting wrecked" thing?

04:52.901 --> 04:54.333
Yeah, sure, but, you know,

04:54.334 --> 04:56.567
Sometimes a loss can bring people together.

04:56.634 --> 04:58.534
Huh. Anyway, i wish your mom would let me

04:58.567 --> 04:59.900
Keep some of this crap here.

04:59.901 --> 05:01.533
It's just gonna have to go into storage.

05:01.534 --> 05:03.901
I was thinking you might
want some of this stuff.

05:03.968 --> 05:05.232
Look at that.

05:05.233 --> 05:07.434
That would go great at your place.

05:07.500 --> 05:09.266
Or not.

05:09.267 --> 05:10.633
How'd your meeting go with satan's spawn?

05:10.634 --> 05:11.967
Gilroy won't deal with me

05:11.968 --> 05:13.366
Until he's convinced i'm his kind of guy.

05:13.367 --> 05:15.968
You got a whole damn burn
notice file that says you are.

05:16.034 --> 05:17.934
He's careful. He's checking me out.

05:17.968 --> 05:20.367
He'll look into the burn file,
keep an eye on me.

05:20.434 --> 05:22.634
I just have to make sure
he likes what he sees.

05:22.701 --> 05:24.466
Yeah, but, mike, playing the rogue operative

05:24.467 --> 05:26.166
After everything you've
done to clear your name -

05:26.167 --> 05:27.199
Are you sure?

05:27.200 --> 05:28.633
I'm already out.

05:28.634 --> 05:30.834
And if this is what i have
to do to get in with gilroy,

05:30.901 --> 05:32.132
I don't have much choice.

05:32.133 --> 05:33.900
Hey, sam? You got a visitor.

05:33.901 --> 05:35.801
Says he's an old friend of yours.

05:46.534 --> 05:47.533
Mack.

05:47.534 --> 05:50.001
Hey, man.

05:50.068 --> 05:51.968
Been a long time.

05:55.734 --> 05:56.633
Sam!

05:56.634 --> 05:58.099
That's okay.

05:58.100 --> 06:00.000
I deserved that.

06:04.467 --> 06:07.133
Sam! Sam! Hey, easy, easy. Sam.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.033
That one, too, i suppose.

06:09.034 --> 06:10.733
All right, look, sam...

06:12.200 --> 06:13.833
...i know you and i have had our problems,

06:13.834 --> 06:15.000
But i need your help.

06:15.001 --> 06:17.667
Can i buy you a beer?

06:17.734 --> 06:19.801
Please.

06:19.867 --> 06:21.901
I'm not in a drinking mood.

06:27.167 --> 06:29.634
Sam, who is this guy?

06:29.701 --> 06:32.567
Oh, we served together
during my s.E.A.L. Days.

06:32.634 --> 06:34.466
You don't look too excited to see him.

06:34.467 --> 06:36.132
Yeah, we had a bit of a falling-Out.

06:36.133 --> 06:39.300
Anything you want to talk about?

06:41.767 --> 06:43.067
I'm sorry, mike. I...

06:45.634 --> 06:48.801
maybe i'll just let him buy me that beer.

06:48.867 --> 06:50.767
I'll be all right.

06:56.767 --> 07:01.233
So, you ever talk to any of
the boys from the old unit?

07:01.300 --> 07:03.334
Man, the s.E.A.L.S have come a long way -

07:03.400 --> 07:05.567
Skip the small talk, mack. Why are you here?

07:09.200 --> 07:11.167
All right.

07:12.567 --> 07:14.567
Here's the deal.

07:14.634 --> 07:17.400
After the navy, i took a
job at the houston p.D.

07:17.467 --> 07:19.333
I work child-Abduction cases.

07:19.334 --> 07:21.434
Most of the time, it's the same old thing -

07:21.500 --> 07:24.133
Some mixed-Up relative snatches a kid

07:24.200 --> 07:27.133
'Cause of some stupid argument.

07:27.200 --> 07:30.601
Every once in a while,
you get a true predator.

07:30.667 --> 07:33.334
And this one's the worst i ever seen.

07:33.400 --> 07:35.132
His name's rincon.

07:35.133 --> 07:36.933
I built a whole case against him,

07:36.934 --> 07:39.100
Enough to put him away for three lifetimes.

07:39.167 --> 07:41.867
We went to the house to get him,
busted down the door,

07:41.934 --> 07:43.834
And the whole goddamn place exploded.

07:43.867 --> 07:46.667
I lost a couple of my best men that day.

07:47.834 --> 07:49.299
Sorry to hear that.

07:49.300 --> 07:50.900
There was a report on the incident.

07:50.901 --> 07:53.701
It said that i hadn't supervised
the assault team properly.

07:53.767 --> 07:54.900
But that wasn't true.

07:54.901 --> 07:56.466
They still suspended me.

07:56.467 --> 07:57.666
What happened to him?

07:57.667 --> 07:59.132
They found some remains in the house -

07:59.133 --> 08:00.533
Nothing conclusive.

08:00.534 --> 08:02.033
And the brass couldn't admit

08:02.034 --> 08:03.766
That the bad guy walked away, though,

08:03.767 --> 08:05.067
So they closed the case.

08:05.068 --> 08:06.399
And you think he's still alive?

08:06.400 --> 08:07.733
I know he is.

08:07.734 --> 08:10.233
Rincon knew he was going down,
so he faked his death,

08:10.300 --> 08:12.367
And i traced the son of a bitch to miami.

08:12.434 --> 08:14.867
So, you catch this guy, you clear your name.

08:14.934 --> 08:16.099
Is that the idea?

08:16.100 --> 08:19.167
Sam, if i go down,

08:19.233 --> 08:21.167
All my other cases go up in smoke,

08:21.233 --> 08:23.133
And a lot of bad guys could walk.

08:26.267 --> 08:28.132
All right.

08:28.133 --> 08:30.300
Sorry.

08:30.367 --> 08:32.267
Shouldn't have asked.

08:33.833 --> 08:35.734
So, mack, you figure this is a two-Man job?

08:36.866 --> 08:39.267
Could use a third man if you know anyone.

08:39.333 --> 08:41.801
I do, but i wouldn't call her
"the third man" to her face.

08:41.866 --> 08:43.767
Thank you.

08:46.834 --> 08:48.033
Look, sam, about our dustup -

08:48.034 --> 08:49.299
Let's not get into it.

08:49.300 --> 08:51.166
We do this, you go home - That's it.

08:51.167 --> 08:53.067
You got it.

08:57.968 --> 09:00.300
Hey.

09:00.367 --> 09:01.466
What can i do for you, maddy?

09:01.467 --> 09:03.567
You all right?

09:03.634 --> 09:05.934
That was some cheap shot
you gave your friend.

09:06.001 --> 09:08.534
Yeah, well, he deserved a lot
more than that, believe me.

09:08.601 --> 09:09.933
So, what happened with you two?

09:09.934 --> 09:11.633
Nothing that concerns you.

09:11.634 --> 09:14.200
Well, it does concern me

09:14.267 --> 09:16.500
Because i've never seen
you like this before.

09:16.567 --> 09:18.399
And now you're doing some job with this guy.

09:18.400 --> 09:20.166
How do you know you can trust him?

09:20.167 --> 09:22.434
My issues with him are not professional,
they are personal,

09:22.500 --> 09:24.634
Which is why i would prefer
if you'd just stay out of it.

09:48.200 --> 09:49.466
So, how do you know

09:49.467 --> 09:51.400
Rincon's gonna show up here?

09:51.467 --> 09:53.867
Mack: rincon was importing
drugs from mexico,

09:53.934 --> 09:56.701
And i've been keeping
track of his old contacts.

09:56.767 --> 09:58.299
I intercepted a call,

09:58.300 --> 10:01.400
And the word is he's doing
a meeting here today.

10:01.467 --> 10:03.166
So, you can't take that to the d.A.?

10:03.167 --> 10:05.734
They're smart enough not
to use the guy's name.

10:05.801 --> 10:08.567
Plus the phone tap wasn't exactly legal.

10:09.867 --> 10:12.467
Our guest has arrived. Wow.

10:12.534 --> 10:15.734
Somehow he looks even more like
a child predator and cop killer

10:15.801 --> 10:18.100
Than he did in the picture.

10:24.834 --> 10:27.367
All right.

10:27.434 --> 10:29.968
You sit tight. We can't spook this guy.

10:35.200 --> 10:39.267
<i>Neighborhood watch is just a
nice idea in most suburbs.</i>

10:39.334 --> 10:42.834
<i>But where you really see it in
action is the inner city.</i>

10:42.901 --> 10:46.100
<i>Only there, it doesn't
protect against crime.</i>

10:46.167 --> 10:48.267
<i>It protects against cops.</i>

10:48.334 --> 10:50.534
<i>Just like cops have dru
g-Detecting dogs,</i>

10:50.601 --> 10:54.701
<i>Some neighborhoods have cop-Detecting
kids.</i>

10:54.767 --> 10:56.533
<i>Once the alarm goes out,</i>

10:56.534 --> 11:01.100
<i>Criminal activity shuts down like a picnic
when it rains.</i>

11:01.167 --> 11:03.534
<i>And any fugitives run
like jackrabbits.</i>

11:09.001 --> 11:10.901
Â¿Chicle?

11:11.068 --> 11:12.968
Â¿PolicÃ­a?

11:14.667 --> 11:17.701
They think we're police. Fi, this is bad.

11:17.767 --> 11:19.701
If rincon thinks the cops
know he's here, he's gone.

11:21.167 --> 11:24.367
Then we'll just have to show
everyone that we're not cops.

11:30.200 --> 11:32.100
What are you looking at?!

11:33.034 --> 11:34.766
Want to hurry up with this, sister?

11:34.767 --> 11:36.399
You want to stop distracting me?

11:38.634 --> 11:40.399
Yeah! Hey! Hey!

11:46.001 --> 11:47.433
Mack: so, you stole this car?

11:47.434 --> 11:48.733
What did you want us to do?

11:48.734 --> 11:50.166
We had to prove to them
that we weren't cops.

11:50.167 --> 11:51.266
You saw the place.

11:51.267 --> 11:53.132
It's a no-Fly zone for gringos.

11:53.167 --> 11:55.767
Mike, listen, i know
you're a little preoccupied

11:55.834 --> 11:57.433
With this whole gilroy business.

11:57.434 --> 11:59.200
Yeah, he's going to be a handful.

11:59.201 --> 12:01.000
I think if michael has time for gilroy,

12:01.351 --> 12:03.251
Then he has time for
finding a child predator.

12:05.718 --> 12:07.450
Okay, what's the problem?

12:07.451 --> 12:09.451
Well, we didn't exactly
blend in to the neighborhood

12:09.517 --> 12:10.783
Where rincon's hiding.

12:10.784 --> 12:12.316
The second we made our move,

12:12.317 --> 12:14.517
The locals sounded the cop alarm,
and he ran.

12:14.584 --> 12:16.416
Look, once you get off the
side streets, forget it.

12:16.417 --> 12:17.849
You set one foot on the main boulevard,

12:17.850 --> 12:19.383
You might as well have a spotlight on you.

12:19.384 --> 12:21.484
Any chance that rincon will pop up again?

12:21.551 --> 12:23.049
No, this is our only chance.

12:23.050 --> 12:24.550
This is over unless - Hang on.

12:24.551 --> 12:25.750
He's probably still in the area.

12:25.751 --> 12:27.183
Yeah, but if we can't go looking for him -

12:27.184 --> 12:29.784
Someone in the neighborhood
will have to look for us,

12:29.850 --> 12:31.483
Someone with an ear to the ground,

12:31.484 --> 12:33.850
Someone rincon won't see coming.
Mike's right.

12:33.917 --> 12:35.883
The local gang will know the
neighborhood better than anyone.

12:35.950 --> 12:37.316
Someone at the top

12:37.317 --> 12:39.551
Was smart enough to set up
a network of eyes and ears.

12:39.617 --> 12:41.016
He'll be able to find rincon.

12:41.017 --> 12:42.550
Wait, you saying that we're gonna get

12:42.551 --> 12:43.817
The local gang leader to help us?

12:43.818 --> 12:45.416
You got a better idea?

12:54.217 --> 12:58.451
So, a buddy of mine pulled
some police files on this area.

12:58.517 --> 13:01.284
Local gang leader's name is omar hernandez.

13:01.351 --> 13:03.517
His crew controls this neighborhood.

13:03.584 --> 13:05.850
He started out doing all the
normal gangbanger stuff -

13:05.917 --> 13:07.616
You know, boosting cars, running guns.

13:07.617 --> 13:09.517
What's his business now?

13:09.551 --> 13:10.817
Must be dealing drugs.

13:10.818 --> 13:12.718
He got guys looking out for the police.

13:12.751 --> 13:14.049
Yeah, well, he's dealing drugs,

13:14.050 --> 13:15.717
But not the kind you're thinking about.

13:15.718 --> 13:16.982
We got aspirin, cold medicine,

13:16.983 --> 13:18.849
Throw in some baby formula, too.

13:18.850 --> 13:20.450
Omar's the lead suspect

13:20.451 --> 13:23.017
In a bunch of chain-Stor
e-Warehouse break-Ins.

13:23.084 --> 13:24.916
See, the bodegas are fencing the stuff.

13:24.917 --> 13:27.084
Got ourselves a regular robin hood.

13:27.150 --> 13:29.184
Yeah, and he knows how to
take care of business, too.

13:29.250 --> 13:30.516
Omar's last arrest

13:30.517 --> 13:32.316
Was for beating the bejesus out of some guy

13:32.317 --> 13:34.083
Who was smacking his girlfriend around.

13:34.084 --> 13:35.583
What, you defending this guy?

13:35.584 --> 13:36.949
You think this neighborhood

13:36.950 --> 13:38.550
Gets a lot of protection from the cops?

13:38.551 --> 13:40.016
I'm just saying, the guy's a thug.

13:40.017 --> 13:41.882
Getting him to find rincon
for us is gonna be tough.

13:41.883 --> 13:45.017
I'll have to be extra convincing.

13:49.718 --> 13:51.283
<i>In an army,</i>

13:51.284 --> 13:54.517
<i>A chain of command gets activated
by unusual events -</i>

13:54.584 --> 13:56.484
<i>Tanks amassing on a border,</i>

13:56.517 --> 13:59.451
<i>A hacking attack on a
central computer,</i>

13:59.517 --> 14:01.983
<i>Assassinations of key personnel.</i>

14:02.050 --> 14:05.050
<i>A street gang's chain of
command is no different.</i>

14:05.117 --> 14:06.750
<i>Showing up in a stolen car</i>

14:06.751 --> 14:08.516
<i>And making a splashy entrance</i>

14:08.517 --> 14:10.400
<i>Will get a message sent
up the ladder.</i>

14:10.435 --> 14:12.283
I'm looking for omar.

14:12.284 --> 14:13.383
Oh, yeah?

14:13.384 --> 14:15.284
Well, we've been looking for that car.

14:16.551 --> 14:18.016
Well, you found it.

14:19.983 --> 14:21.049
Sorry.

14:21.050 --> 14:22.950
We don't know no omar.

14:24.417 --> 14:26.317
Aah!

14:27.351 --> 14:29.850
I'll be waiting for omar in there.

14:50.651 --> 14:52.551
Here comes the king of the barrio.

15:08.117 --> 15:10.417
Nice suit.

15:10.484 --> 15:12.818
What are you, the devil or something?

15:12.883 --> 15:14.550
Call me whatever you like,

15:14.551 --> 15:16.451
But my name is louis.

15:16.517 --> 15:19.117
Let's beat his ass, omar.

15:23.317 --> 15:24.849
What is it you want, louis?

15:24.850 --> 15:28.317
A man named rincon is
hiding in your neighborhood.

15:28.384 --> 15:30.083
You're going to find him for me.

15:30.084 --> 15:31.316
Why would i do that?

15:31.317 --> 15:35.384
Because his business is hurting children...

15:35.451 --> 15:37.384
and your business is protecting them.

15:37.451 --> 15:39.116
You seem to know a lot about me.

15:39.117 --> 15:40.650
I don't know nothing about you.

15:40.651 --> 15:42.551
You know all you need to know.

15:45.017 --> 15:46.616
You got a funny way of talking.

15:46.617 --> 15:48.751
You use words, but you don't say nothing.

15:48.818 --> 15:50.718
I say what i mean.

15:51.617 --> 15:52.616
Well, let me say what i mean.

15:52.617 --> 15:54.183
Yeah, i protect my people.

15:54.184 --> 15:55.316
I provide for them.

15:55.317 --> 15:56.783
If it wasn't for me and my crew,

15:56.784 --> 15:58.116
Gangbangers one block over

15:58.117 --> 16:00.084
Would be doing driv
e-Bys in the middle of the street,

16:00.150 --> 16:02.484
And little babies would be going hungry.

16:02.551 --> 16:04.316
So, see, i don't got time
to play with no devil

16:04.317 --> 16:06.016
Or whatever you think you are.

16:06.017 --> 16:08.584
The devil wants rincon's soul.

16:08.651 --> 16:11.384
I just want the man.

16:11.451 --> 16:14.651
The faster you give him to me,
the faster i go away.

16:14.718 --> 16:15.750
Or what?

16:15.751 --> 16:17.983
Or this.

16:30.050 --> 16:31.950
Man: he's gone!

16:39.017 --> 16:40.550
Madeline: is that the bad guy?

16:40.551 --> 16:42.049
Oh, it's more like the guy

16:42.050 --> 16:44.384
Who's supposed to go
looking for the bad guy.

16:44.451 --> 16:46.351
Put a tracker and a bug in his car.

16:48.384 --> 16:50.016
How come you're not out with sam?

16:50.017 --> 16:53.484
Your boy and sam got a
peculiar way of doing things.

16:53.551 --> 16:55.016
Sam thought it would be best

16:55.017 --> 16:57.250
If i kept a watch on things from here.

16:57.317 --> 16:58.817
What happened with you two?

16:58.818 --> 17:00.650
You know, with all due respect, ma'am,

17:00.651 --> 17:02.751
That's - That's really
none of your business.

17:02.818 --> 17:04.282
Oh.

17:04.284 --> 17:07.416
Well, i'm making it my business.

17:07.483 --> 17:09.483
He's my son's best friend.

17:10.818 --> 17:13.084
And come to think about it, he's mine, too.

17:14.684 --> 17:16.718
The point is, i'm worried about him.

17:16.784 --> 17:18.349
He's not himself.

17:18.351 --> 17:19.817
With the drinking -

17:20.883 --> 17:23.617
No, no, sam's always liked his beer.

17:23.684 --> 17:25.718
<i>He's not drinking,
is what i'm saying.</i>

17:27.983 --> 17:30.584
A- All right, here it is.

17:30.651 --> 17:32.551
You know he was married.

17:33.983 --> 17:35.483
Ohh.

17:35.484 --> 17:37.350
You screwed around with his wife.

17:37.351 --> 17:39.351
It wt that simple.

17:39.417 --> 17:42.317
Yeah, well, it never is.

17:53.117 --> 17:54.817
What do we have, sam?

17:54.818 --> 17:56.183
Well, omar's been talking a lot

17:56.184 --> 17:58.217
About some crazy guy who
wants him to find rincon,

17:58.284 --> 18:00.184
But he hasn't made a move yet.

18:05.150 --> 18:07.284
Who's mr. Personality there?

18:07.351 --> 18:09.251
Oh, that's felipe vega.

18:10.651 --> 18:11.949
They work together?

18:11.950 --> 18:14.617
No, vega runs a bigger gang, northside 13.

18:14.684 --> 18:16.483
They've been inching in
on omar's neighborhood.

18:16.484 --> 18:19.017
He's careful. Yeah, and ruthless.

18:19.084 --> 18:20.350
His crew's been busy collecting scalps,

18:20.351 --> 18:22.684
Mostly rival gangbangers, it looks like.

18:27.284 --> 18:29.517
I like your neighborhood.

18:29.584 --> 18:31.283
It's nice and clean.

18:31.284 --> 18:34.084
Everybody seems so happy.

18:34.150 --> 18:35.316
Is that a new car?

18:35.317 --> 18:36.383
It's new enough.

18:37.850 --> 18:39.751
Don't try to play me, omar.

18:39.818 --> 18:42.250
I know you're doing all right.

18:42.317 --> 18:44.584
Pretty busy inside there.

18:44.651 --> 18:46.316
Now, you got my shipment?

18:46.317 --> 18:47.683
Nah.

18:47.684 --> 18:50.484
Everything i have,
i got people counting on it.

18:50.551 --> 18:52.451
I told you i was gonna be by every week.

18:52.486 --> 18:53.916
And i told you i don't got it.

18:53.917 --> 18:55.483
So, you can keep what you took last week.

18:55.484 --> 18:56.650
What i took?!

18:56.651 --> 18:59.017
It sounds like i stole something.

18:59.084 --> 19:00.450
Look, let's get something straight.

19:00.451 --> 19:03.017
That was payment for protection.

19:03.084 --> 19:05.883
You never know who come in
here and start trouble for you.

19:09.751 --> 19:11.651
See what i mean?

19:12.651 --> 19:16.117
IsuÃ©ltame, por favor!

19:16.184 --> 19:19.517
Let go! Hey! Hey! Ya, ya, ya, para!

19:19.584 --> 19:21.484
Now, me and you got a beef?

19:21.551 --> 19:23.451
No. You'll get your shipment.

19:23.517 --> 19:24.982
Just get out of here.

19:24.983 --> 19:26.316
Get out of here?!

19:26.317 --> 19:27.949
You're pushing it, omar.

19:27.950 --> 19:30.451
Now, you pack my stuff up in the van -

19:30.517 --> 19:32.950
The good stuff, the prescription stuff.

19:33.017 --> 19:36.983
My boys will pick it up at
your warehouse over on 26th.

19:37.050 --> 19:39.983
And, omar...

19:40.050 --> 19:41.950
don't try and burn me again.

19:43.551 --> 19:46.284
VÃ¡manos. Sam: looks like he's got
bigger problems than you, mike.

19:46.351 --> 19:49.417
Guess i'll have to become a bigger problem,
then. What are you thinking?

19:49.484 --> 19:51.684
If that van vega wants goes missing,

19:51.751 --> 19:54.184
Omar will have to deal with whoever took it.

19:54.250 --> 19:56.150
And that's you.

19:56.784 --> 19:58.950
Okay, i guess we'll have to
get over to omar's warehouse.

20:00.983 --> 20:04.551
<i>Because warehouses store bulk items and not
people,</i>

20:04.617 --> 20:06.617
<i>They're usually built cheaply.</i>

20:06.684 --> 20:10.317
<i>Most of the time, the roofs are just
plywood and asphalt tiles.</i>

20:10.384 --> 20:13.517
<i>Attach a hole-Saw bit to a silenced
drill,</i>

20:13.584 --> 20:15.784
<i>And you can bore through the roof</i>

20:15.850 --> 20:17.983
<i>Without attracting attention.</i>

20:30.417 --> 20:32.950
<i>If you want to create a
bigger opening,</i>

20:33.017 --> 20:34.450
<i>A few ounces of c-4</i>

20:34.451 --> 20:36.384
<i>On the brackets holding
the door in place</i>

20:36.451 --> 20:37.583
<i>Will do the trick.</i>

20:44.617 --> 20:46.316
All set, mike.

20:46.317 --> 20:47.949
You'll be able to stroll right in.

20:47.950 --> 20:49.049
Yeah, fi.

20:49.050 --> 20:51.917
Uh-Oh. We got a visitor.

20:51.983 --> 20:55.184
It's gilroy in a maserati up the block.

20:55.250 --> 20:57.584
What is he doing here?

20:57.651 --> 20:59.083
Getting to know me.

20:59.084 --> 21:01.584
I guess i'll have to put on a good show.

21:17.883 --> 21:20.150
<i>Dominance in the battlefield</i>

21:20.217 --> 21:22.551
<i>Isn't always about the use
of a lethal force.</i>

21:22.617 --> 21:24.316
<i>Sometimes it's more effective...</i>

21:24.317 --> 21:26.384
<i>...to leave a few targets around to spread
the word.</i>

21:31.718 --> 21:33.016
Ungh!

21:33.017 --> 21:34.450
<i>Rubber-Composite bullets</i>

21:34.451 --> 21:36.016
<i>Fired from a suppressed rifle</i>

21:36.017 --> 21:37.717
<i>Won't kill your enemy.</i>

21:39.217 --> 21:41.117
Ohh!

21:44.384 --> 21:45.717
<i>But it will make them think twice</i>

21:45.718 --> 21:47.618
<i>About staying in the fight.</i>

21:50.850 --> 21:51.316
What do you want?

21:51.317 --> 21:53.217
I'm here for the van. What van?

22:30.517 --> 22:32.651
<i>Selling yourself to an adversary</i>

22:32.718 --> 22:35.150
<i>Is a bit like getting drafted
on a sports team.</i>

22:35.217 --> 22:37.016
<i>You may look good on paper,</i>

22:37.017 --> 22:39.384
<i>But, eventually, they'll want to see you on
the field.</i>

22:44.684 --> 22:46.817
Why the hell are you following me?

22:46.883 --> 22:49.817
Just curious about where
that van of yours is headed.

22:49.883 --> 22:51.483
I told you - I have to get to know you.

22:51.484 --> 22:54.184
You can do that without
compromising my operations.

22:54.251 --> 22:55.617
I had to see you in action.

22:55.618 --> 22:58.317
And i have to say,
you've lived up to your reputation.

22:58.384 --> 22:59.949
Such panache.

22:59.950 --> 23:01.917
I love the suit. Who are you wearing?

23:01.984 --> 23:03.483
You know, you're awfully confident

23:03.484 --> 23:04.650
I won't shoot you right here.

23:04.651 --> 23:05.916
Don't be.

23:05.917 --> 23:07.817
Maybe i'm just not that
afraid of rubber bullets.

23:07.883 --> 23:10.184
You were awfully gentle with
those chaps at the warehouse.

23:12.551 --> 23:14.116
I was as gentle as i had to be.

23:14.117 --> 23:16.351
I can't have a homicide
detective poking around.

23:16.417 --> 23:18.149
Hmm. Fair enough.

23:18.150 --> 23:19.882
Is that why you were following me -

23:19.883 --> 23:22.584
To compliment me on my suit
and ask me stupid questions?

23:22.651 --> 23:25.184
I came to see if you're the sort
of person i'd like to work with,

23:25.251 --> 23:26.650
And it appears that you are.

23:26.651 --> 23:28.584
I'm glad you like what you saw.

23:28.651 --> 23:31.984
I have a little project
that may interest you.

23:32.050 --> 23:33.950
I'll be in touch.

23:36.651 --> 23:39.084
Oh, by the way, who is the van for?

23:39.150 --> 23:41.351
I don't kiss and tell.

23:42.750 --> 23:44.650
Good to know.

23:47.017 --> 23:48.450
Oh, jesus. I've been calling you.

23:48.451 --> 23:49.849
I threw my phone away.

23:49.850 --> 23:52.883
I think gilroy used my phone
to triangulate my position.

23:52.950 --> 23:54.483
He's good.

23:54.484 --> 23:55.949
I just got that phone two days ago.

23:55.950 --> 23:57.583
Well, what did he want?

23:57.584 --> 23:59.817
He wanted to see if i was the
same kind of monster he is.

23:59.883 --> 24:01.550
Apparently, i am.

24:01.551 --> 24:03.817
No, you're not.

24:03.883 --> 24:05.783
But if you fake it long enough...

24:05.817 --> 24:08.517
you don't have to worry about me, fi.

24:08.584 --> 24:10.950
Look, i know you want to
stop whatever he's planning,

24:11.017 --> 24:13.384
But can't we just shoot him
and get on with our lives?

24:13.451 --> 24:15.384
Gilroy does work for hire.

24:15.451 --> 24:17.016
He's the tip of a very nasty iceberg.

24:17.017 --> 24:18.917
It doesn't end with him.

24:19.783 --> 24:21.149
Sam?

24:21.150 --> 24:22.049
Hey, fi. Is mikey there?

24:22.050 --> 24:23.049
Yeah, he's here.

24:25.384 --> 24:27.284
He was looking for you, too.

24:29.150 --> 24:30.650
Yeah, sam.

24:30.651 --> 24:33.351
I've been monitoring the fallout
from your warehouse stunt.

24:33.417 --> 24:35.317
Omar's pretty freaked about his missing van.

24:35.351 --> 24:36.583
I guess it's time to see

24:36.584 --> 24:38.484
If he's ready to help us find rincon.

24:38.551 --> 24:42.017
He's at the botanica on 17th.

24:44.284 --> 24:46.184
Omar.

24:47.584 --> 24:50.883
I want the van! Now! Where is it?!

24:50.950 --> 24:52.782
I can tell you where it will be -

24:52.783 --> 24:55.351
In your driveway when you give me rincon.

24:55.417 --> 24:56.816
I'm not afraid of you, man.

24:56.817 --> 24:58.583
You may have some fancy little tricks,

24:58.584 --> 25:00.116
But you're still flesh and blood.

25:00.117 --> 25:02.150
And believe me,
i know how to make you bleed.

25:02.217 --> 25:04.417
You touch me, and your
whole world comes apart.

25:04.484 --> 25:06.283
I'm not talking about just your car.

25:06.284 --> 25:08.750
I'm talking about your
house on east 18th street,

25:08.817 --> 25:10.216
Your stores on river drive,

25:10.217 --> 25:11.650
You.

25:11.651 --> 25:14.850
There won't be a place on
this earth that you can hide.

25:14.917 --> 25:19.217
You give me rincon, and i'll disappear.

25:19.284 --> 25:21.684
I need a few hours.

25:33.684 --> 25:35.718
You're not packing my ice babies, are you?

25:35.783 --> 25:37.718
Uh, no, maddy. Those are staying behind.

25:37.783 --> 25:39.149
Good, 'cause you destroyed

25:39.150 --> 25:40.983
Half my winter wonderland collection

25:40.984 --> 25:42.283
When you blew up my house.

25:42.284 --> 25:44.149
Come on, now. I thought
we were past all that.

25:44.150 --> 25:46.551
We are. I was just pulling your chain.

25:46.618 --> 25:49.651
The truth is, i was thinking
about replacing them anyway,

25:49.718 --> 25:52.417
So it really didn't matter
what you did with them.

25:52.484 --> 25:56.150
I mean, seriously,
why would i hold this against you?

25:56.217 --> 25:58.117
You talked to mack, didn't you?

26:00.284 --> 26:03.950
Sam, your marriage had been over for years

26:04.017 --> 26:05.917
Before he ever said a word to your wife.

26:05.950 --> 26:07.550
There's a code, madeline.

26:07.551 --> 26:10.050
You don't sit in another
man's canoe, period.

26:10.117 --> 26:11.949
We're not talking about a boat, sam.

26:11.950 --> 26:13.250
Yeah, and i'm not talking

26:13.251 --> 26:15.116
About some creepy ic
e-Skating figurine, either.

26:15.117 --> 26:16.550
You let her go.

26:16.551 --> 26:18.684
Was she supposed to be
miserable the rest of her life?

26:18.750 --> 26:20.650
He took very good care of her.

26:23.783 --> 26:26.584
And i told you to stay out of it.

26:26.651 --> 26:29.150
You want to be like that? Fine.

26:29.217 --> 26:32.284
You still owe me an ice-Skating snowman.

26:34.551 --> 26:37.950
<i>The best defense isn't always
a show of force.</i>

26:38.017 --> 26:41.184
<i>Keep an adversary in the dark about
what you're capable of,</i>

26:41.251 --> 26:43.217
<i>And he has to assume the worst.</i>

26:43.284 --> 26:44.816
Jesus! Man!

26:47.417 --> 26:49.351
We looked for your guy.

26:49.417 --> 26:50.949
You found rincon.

26:50.950 --> 26:52.083
Yeah, i found him.

26:52.084 --> 26:53.516
You know how protected he is?

26:53.517 --> 26:56.084
You had three hours to give me rincon,

26:56.150 --> 26:57.717
Not give me excuses.

26:57.718 --> 26:59.817
You thought you were so smart, right?

26:59.883 --> 27:01.817
Stealing that van that vega wanted?

27:01.883 --> 27:04.984
Well, guess what
That's who's protecting rincon.

27:05.050 --> 27:06.583
I hear they're business partners, man.

27:06.584 --> 27:08.984
Rincon's been supplying
vega with drugs for years.

27:09.050 --> 27:11.850
You think he's gonna give up that
connection? Let me worry about that.

27:11.917 --> 27:13.683
No, man, i got to worry about it.

27:13.684 --> 27:15.718
Me and vega are this close
to going to war already.

27:15.783 --> 27:17.416
If he founds out, man -

27:17.417 --> 27:19.517
Look, i ain't afraid to die, okay?

27:19.584 --> 27:23.618
But my people
Vega will go after everybody.

27:23.684 --> 27:26.451
If you don't give me what i want,

27:26.517 --> 27:29.883
Vega will be the least of your worries.

27:35.451 --> 27:37.917
Rincon's hiding in an
abandoned housing project

27:37.984 --> 27:39.450
On west 15th, unit 402.

27:39.451 --> 27:41.850
He's got some of vega's guys with him.

27:43.117 --> 27:45.017
You better hurry.

27:45.718 --> 27:47.984
And you better pray vega doesn't find out!

28:02.984 --> 28:05.684
<i>When you're extracting a

28:05.750 --> 28:07.783

28:07.850 --> 28:11.017
<i>Guards watch windows and doors.</i>

28:12.217 --> 28:13.749
<i>So if you come in</i>

28:13.750 --> 28:15.817
<i>Through the common wall of a
neighboring apartment,</i>

28:15.883 --> 28:17.683
<i>You've got surprise on your side,</i>

28:17.684 --> 28:20.984
<i>Not to mention a shower of
shattered concrete.</i>

28:21.050 --> 28:22.950
Shh.

28:24.684 --> 28:27.284
What is it, mike?
It's a little too quiet in there.

28:31.050 --> 28:34.150
And a little too quiet out there, too.

28:34.217 --> 28:37.117
<i>Of course, surprise doesn't
count for much</i>

28:37.184 --> 28:39.084
<i>If you're walking into a trap.</i>

28:39.150 --> 28:41.050
Looks like vega decided to crash the party.

28:45.684 --> 28:48.284
We got guys coming up the stairs.

28:48.351 --> 28:50.651
I hope you brought enough rope, sam.

28:50.718 --> 28:53.817
<i>Traditional rappelling requires
holding a rope with both hands,</i>

28:53.883 --> 28:57.050
<i>Which is inconvenient if you're being shot
at.</i>

28:57.117 --> 28:59.384
<i>That's why special forces</i>

28:59.451 --> 29:02.284
<i>Are trained to rappel in
unconventional ways.</i>

29:07.883 --> 29:09.783
Aah!

29:23.084 --> 29:24.984
Get down!

29:48.960 --> 29:50.560
It was a goddamn setup.

29:50.561 --> 29:52.728
Your boy omar almost got us killed.

29:52.794 --> 29:54.226
That doesn't make any sense.

29:54.227 --> 29:55.693
He hates vega. Just calm down.

29:55.694 --> 29:57.594
Oh, the hell i will. Omar sold us out.

29:57.627 --> 29:59.661
That's funny - You talking about betrayal.

29:59.728 --> 30:03.594
Boys, fight and get it over
with or put a sock in it.

30:03.661 --> 30:05.360
You're gonna want to hear this.

30:05.361 --> 30:07.627
What is it? I've been listening
to the bug in omar's car.

30:07.694 --> 30:08.959
Vega tried to kill him, too.

30:11.260 --> 30:12.827
Omar: oh, god damn it! Get down!

30:12.828 --> 30:14.360
Jesus, omar, you're bleeding!

30:14.361 --> 30:15.460
Drive, man! Go!

30:15.461 --> 30:16.959
He got clipped in the arm.

30:16.960 --> 30:18.760
I hope i screamed less
when it happened to me.

30:18.761 --> 30:21.627
Vega found out omar was looking for rincon.

30:21.694 --> 30:23.426
Well, he nearly got killed because of us.

30:23.427 --> 30:26.194
And vega's probably not gonna
stop until he finishes the job.

30:26.260 --> 30:29.027
I can't believe i'm saying
this about a gangbanger,

30:29.094 --> 30:31.127
But we ought to do something to help omar.

30:31.194 --> 30:33.494
Yeah.

30:39.160 --> 30:41.060
Omar!

30:46.060 --> 30:48.694
Man, you got some balls coming here.

30:48.761 --> 30:51.294
You shouldn't point guns at friends.

30:51.361 --> 30:53.427
Oh, now you my friend? I can be.

30:53.494 --> 30:55.394
Man, we almost got killed because of you!

30:55.461 --> 30:57.627
Vega's got guys looking all over for us!

30:57.694 --> 30:59.728
He's gonna tear up the whole neighborhood.

30:59.794 --> 31:01.493
Man, i should have shot you
while i had the chance.

31:01.494 --> 31:04.127
You shoot me, you'll still
have a problem with vega.

31:04.194 --> 31:07.361
You don't, vega will have a problem with me.

31:07.427 --> 31:09.093
You don't know what you're talking about.

31:09.094 --> 31:10.526
Vega and rincon -

31:10.527 --> 31:12.860
They're gonna take miami
apart until they find you.

31:12.927 --> 31:14.793
Why don't i save them the trouble?

31:14.794 --> 31:16.493
I want you to take me to them.

31:16.494 --> 31:18.694
I will finish this for both of us.

31:18.761 --> 31:20.193
Man, you crazy.

31:20.194 --> 31:22.828
Hear me out...inside.

31:24.594 --> 31:25.793
Now.

31:25.794 --> 31:27.728
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

31:30.661 --> 31:32.661
All right.

31:32.728 --> 31:34.628
Just don't do nothing.

31:42.327 --> 31:44.227
I give him you. That's not enough?

31:44.294 --> 31:46.694
I got to give him my
whole damn neighborhood?

31:46.761 --> 31:48.893
Vega has to believe he's won.

31:48.960 --> 31:50.860
I don't know about this, man.

31:50.927 --> 31:54.027
He's gonna want to meet on my
territory, make a big show.

31:54.094 --> 31:55.560
You want him to.

31:55.561 --> 31:57.893
He just has a few guys
with guns on his side.

31:57.960 --> 32:00.094
You have a whole neighborhood on yours.

32:00.160 --> 32:01.526
But what about when we get inside?

32:01.527 --> 32:03.360
Vega's gonna have that
place locked down tight.

32:03.361 --> 32:04.859
He won't let any of my boys in with us.

32:04.860 --> 32:07.094
It's just you and me.

32:07.160 --> 32:10.661
If everything goes right,
you and me is all we need.

32:10.728 --> 32:12.393
I leave with rincon.

32:12.394 --> 32:14.059
You leave with vega.

32:14.060 --> 32:15.960
Are you ready to end this or not?

32:18.327 --> 32:20.494
I'm ready.

32:20.561 --> 32:24.327
<i>Camouflage is commonly associated

32:24.394 --> 32:27.627
<i>But the truth is that it's just as
important in urban settings.</i>

32:27.694 --> 32:29.460
<i>You're bound to draw attention</i>

32:29.461 --> 32:31.527
<i>Setting up a bulletproof
barricade on the sidewalk</i>

32:31.594 --> 32:34.860
<i>Or toting a concussion charge
down the street.</i>

32:34.927 --> 32:36.526
<i>But fruit stands reinforced</i>

32:36.527 --> 32:39.427
<i>With strips of steel-Belted tires</i>

32:39.494 --> 32:43.260
<i>And ice-Cream carts packed with explosives
blend right in.</i>

32:43.327 --> 32:47.461
<i>Of course, the ultimate trojan horse
is a shackled prisoner.</i>

32:47.527 --> 32:49.427
Where have you been hiding these?

33:01.860 --> 33:03.828
<i>A paranoid enemy might go so far</i>

33:03.893 --> 33:07.494
<i>As frisking a hostage who's
wearing handcuffs,</i>

33:07.561 --> 33:10.761
<i>But people tend not to check if one of the
handcuff links</i>

33:10.828 --> 33:13.461
<i>Is made of polystyrene...</i>

33:13.527 --> 33:16.427
<i>or if there's a listening
device in the pinlock.</i>

33:37.094 --> 33:38.994
Welcome to my neighborhood, omar.

33:39.027 --> 33:40.927
Now, everyone said

33:40.993 --> 33:44.361
<i>The people in your neighborhood
were so loyal.</i>

33:44.427 --> 33:45.959
I don't see none of them here.

33:45.960 --> 33:49.094
You know, when you started
sticking your nose

33:49.160 --> 33:50.593
In my business,

33:50.594 --> 33:52.159
I figured you were up to something.

33:52.160 --> 33:54.094
So i grabbed one of your guys.

33:54.160 --> 33:57.027
One hour with my knife,

33:57.094 --> 33:59.127
He started spilling everything.

33:59.194 --> 34:01.794
That's all you get for loyalty -

34:01.860 --> 34:03.126
One hour.

34:03.127 --> 34:04.526
Yeah, i guess you're right.

34:04.527 --> 34:06.026
You disappoint me.

34:06.027 --> 34:10.393
Everyone said, "ooh! Omar will
go down in a blaze of glory!"

34:11.860 --> 34:13.761
One little scratch on your arm,

34:13.828 --> 34:17.393
And you come crying to me
like a bitch to kiss my ring.

34:17.460 --> 34:20.694
I think we just had a
misunderstanding, that's all.

34:20.761 --> 34:23.260
Misunderstanding?

34:23.327 --> 34:25.092
I like that.

34:25.094 --> 34:27.993
Let's get this misunderstanding
cleared up right now.

34:28.060 --> 34:29.960
Show me your mystery man!

34:32.561 --> 34:34.460
VÃ¡manos.

34:39.694 --> 34:41.360
So, we cool?

34:41.360 --> 34:44.460
Cool?

34:44.460 --> 34:46.527
You think one freak in a suit

34:46.594 --> 34:48.494
Is gonna make things even?

34:48.527 --> 34:50.059
Let me tell you something -

34:50.060 --> 34:52.561
In my kingdom, peace don't come cheap.

34:52.627 --> 34:55.494
Today, i'll take your neighborhood.

34:55.561 --> 34:57.993
Tomorrow, i'll take your woman.

34:58.060 --> 34:59.926
It's a new world, omar.

34:59.927 --> 35:00.926
Get used to it.

35:00.927 --> 35:02.626
Get these putos inside.

35:02.627 --> 35:04.026
Come on.

35:04.027 --> 35:05.226
The rest of you stay out here.

35:05.227 --> 35:07.694
If they want some, shoot them.

35:23.394 --> 35:26.627
So, who are you?

35:31.127 --> 35:32.593
I asked you a question.

35:32.594 --> 35:34.060
Who are you?

35:34.061 --> 35:36.228
You'll find out soon enough.

35:37.927 --> 35:39.827
Ugh!

35:42.827 --> 35:44.626
Are you a cop?

35:44.627 --> 35:47.161
A cop?

35:47.228 --> 35:48.526
You're not that lucky.

35:48.527 --> 35:50.427
Ugh!

35:52.927 --> 35:55.194
Answers.

35:55.261 --> 35:58.094
Tell me, what kind of
man comes looking for me

35:58.161 --> 35:59.759
Dressed in a suit like that?

35:59.760 --> 36:01.426
What kind of man?

36:01.427 --> 36:04.027
What kind of man preys on children?

36:06.094 --> 36:10.261
Did that bitch who brought those
charges against me send you?

36:10.328 --> 36:12.328
Hmm.

36:12.393 --> 36:14.994
She was always whining about her kid.

36:19.727 --> 36:24.560
Tell me who you are,
or i will make this so painful

36:24.627 --> 36:29.360
That you will beg for mercy,
and it will not come.

36:29.427 --> 36:31.460
You don't know what pain is.

36:34.161 --> 36:37.694
But you will, i promise.

36:39.127 --> 36:41.228
Don't look at them.

36:41.294 --> 36:43.427
They'll see what you really are.

36:46.127 --> 36:48.027
Coward.

36:50.493 --> 36:51.860
Go to hell.

36:51.861 --> 36:53.426
Come with me.

37:28.861 --> 37:30.961
<i>Welcome to my neighborhood.</i>

37:37.460 --> 37:39.360
I made you a promise.

37:39.994 --> 37:42.360
It's time.

37:44.261 --> 37:47.427
Miami p.D. Is transporting
rincon back to houston.

37:47.493 --> 37:50.294
He's lucky he's not going
back in a body bag.

37:50.360 --> 37:52.260
You know, you and your friends

37:52.261 --> 37:54.228
Got a strange way of doing things,

37:54.294 --> 37:56.194
But i guess i can't complain.

37:57.794 --> 37:59.694
Thank you, sam.

38:05.027 --> 38:07.894
Yeah, hey, um, about amanda -

38:07.961 --> 38:11.194
Just wanted to say...

38:13.560 --> 38:15.460
...thanks for taking care of her.

38:16.094 --> 38:18.094
I was never real good about doing that.

38:18.161 --> 38:21.460
I guess the mission always came first.

38:21.527 --> 38:24.328
Yeah, well, for what it's worth,

38:24.393 --> 38:26.293
She left me, too.

38:27.927 --> 38:29.726
Don't think she ever got over you.

38:29.727 --> 38:31.526
Who could?

38:34.560 --> 38:35.893
You ever need anything -

38:35.894 --> 38:37.794
I'll let you know.

38:43.127 --> 38:45.927
Hey, maddy, you feel like having a beer?

38:45.994 --> 38:47.492
Come on.

38:49.328 --> 38:52.961
So, a lot of people are asking
about the guy in the suit.

38:53.027 --> 38:55.560
I don't know what to tell them.

38:55.627 --> 38:58.827
I'm just the guy that
helped you get back on top,

38:58.894 --> 39:00.327
That's all.

39:00.328 --> 39:03.427
Still can't figure you out, man.

39:03.493 --> 39:06.027
Honestly, omar...

39:06.094 --> 39:08.560
don't try.

39:25.461 --> 39:27.060
Hey, fi. Thanks for coming.

39:27.061 --> 39:28.293
Shut up.

39:28.294 --> 39:29.659
There's something that i have to say.

39:29.660 --> 39:31.627
You want me backing you up

39:31.693 --> 39:33.293
On more of these little gilroy meetings,

39:33.294 --> 39:35.361
Then you're gonna hear me out,
right here, right now,

39:35.428 --> 39:38.361
In another one of these
little wasted hotel rooms.

39:38.428 --> 39:40.093
You are gonna get yourself killed.

39:40.094 --> 39:41.994
You're gonna wind up dead.

39:43.994 --> 39:46.760
Um...i'm not dead yet.

39:46.827 --> 39:50.294
You know, i have more ammunition
in this case than i need.

39:50.361 --> 39:53.760
You want to be quiet,
or you want me to start using it?

39:58.027 --> 40:00.760
Sam doesn't agree with me.

40:00.827 --> 40:02.727
And i didn't want to worry your mother.

40:02.760 --> 40:05.794
Otherwise, this would be a ful
l-Scale intervention.

40:06.994 --> 40:10.794
You work too hard.

40:10.860 --> 40:12.760
Fi - Shh!

40:13.660 --> 40:15.860
I appreciate what you did finding rincon.

40:15.927 --> 40:17.659
And there's maybe a little part of me

40:17.660 --> 40:19.760
That understands what
you're doing with gilroy.

40:19.827 --> 40:22.827
But that cannot be what
you do all day, every day.

40:22.894 --> 40:26.294
You cannot keep burning the
candle at both ends, michael!

40:26.361 --> 40:28.160
How do you expect to stay focused

40:28.161 --> 40:30.627
When you exhaust yourself like this?

40:30.693 --> 40:31.993
You need a life...

40:31.994 --> 40:34.860
or you're gonna wind up dead.

40:34.927 --> 40:36.793
It's just basic operational sense.

40:36.794 --> 40:38.694
Are you finished?

40:40.294 --> 40:42.593
Sure. Fine.

40:57.760 --> 40:59.660
Where do you want me?

41:04.361 --> 41:06.560
How about right here?

41:08.227 --> 41:14.860
Gilroy said he would call here...

41:14.927 --> 41:17.794
for the place and the time of our meeting.

41:17.860 --> 41:20.894
He said he would call here

41:20.960 --> 41:22.860
<i>Tomorrow morning.</i>

41:25.827 --> 41:27.727
Michael, did you ask me here to -

41:27.760 --> 41:30.727
Like i said, i'm not dead yet.

41:54.794 --> 41:56.460
Hello?

41:56.461 --> 41:58.361
Good morning, westen.

41:59.927 --> 42:01.559
Gilroy, you're up early.

42:01.560 --> 42:03.093
As are you.

42:03.094 --> 42:05.294
Surprising, given what a
busy boy you've been lately.

42:05.361 --> 42:06.360
Oh?

42:06.361 --> 42:07.626
Oh, no need to be coy.

42:07.627 --> 42:09.994
I hear there was a certain transfer of power

42:10.061 --> 42:12.127
In a certain section of little dominica

42:12.194 --> 42:14.494
That a certain someone had
a role in facilitating.

42:14.560 --> 42:16.093
I wouldn't know about that.

42:16.094 --> 42:18.161
You really don't kiss and tell, do you?

42:18.227 --> 42:20.093
Well, since you're up,
any chance we can have a chat?

42:20.094 --> 42:22.627
I'd love to, but, uh -

42:22.693 --> 42:25.094
But you have a more pressing engagement?

42:25.161 --> 42:26.527
You could say that.

42:26.528 --> 42:28.160
Don't keep me waiting.

42:28.195 --> 42:29.793
So we're in business?

42:29.794 --> 42:30.926
Yes, we are.

42:30.927 --> 42:33.560
And there's lots of work to be done.
