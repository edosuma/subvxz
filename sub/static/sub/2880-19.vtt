WEBVTT

00:04.194 --> 00:07.996
Boy, do I have to urinate.

00:07.998 --> 00:11.566
If only there were a solution
to that.

00:11.568 --> 00:15.437
Seriously. I feel like I've got
a fish tank in my pelvis.

00:16.271 --> 00:18.039
So go to the bathroom.

00:18.041 --> 00:19.307
I can't.

00:19.309 --> 00:21.810
Why not?

00:21.812 --> 00:23.445
Because I'm trying to decide
between getting

00:23.447 --> 00:26.081
an Xbox One or a PS4.

00:27.150 --> 00:30.685
Oh, "pee." Why'd I say that?

00:31.587 --> 00:33.955
Forgive me for asking
a stupid question,

00:33.957 --> 00:36.024
but why are you being stupid?

00:36.893 --> 00:38.593
I'm not being stupid.

00:38.595 --> 00:41.630
I'm employing the work
of Dutch researcher, Mirjam Tuk,

00:41.632 --> 00:45.567
who found that people with full
bladders make better decisions.

00:45.569 --> 00:49.304
Why did I pee before I decided
to move in here?

00:51.108 --> 00:52.307
Hi!
Hey.

00:52.309 --> 00:53.475
Oh, how'd the audition go?

00:53.477 --> 00:55.443
I killed it. I was even able
to cry real tears

00:55.445 --> 00:56.411
right on the spot.

00:56.413 --> 00:57.712
Oh, that's great.
I know.

00:57.714 --> 00:59.748
Next time I get pulled over
for a speeding ticket,

00:59.750 --> 01:00.949
here come the waterworks.

01:00.951 --> 01:03.752
Here come the waterworks!

01:07.757 --> 01:09.257
Aren't you gonna ask?

01:09.259 --> 01:11.526

my first day?

01:40.699 --> 01:42.700
Can I get your
opinion on something

01:42.702 --> 01:44.068
that happened at work today?

01:44.070 --> 01:45.269
Yeah, sure.
Of course.

01:45.271 --> 01:46.704
Okay, well, I did something

01:46.706 --> 01:48.906
that will either make me look
like a lovable goof

01:48.908 --> 01:53.177
or a horrible monster damned
to spend eternity in hell.

01:53.179 --> 01:54.846
I'm sure it's lovable.

01:54.848 --> 01:58.182
I'm gonna go with monster.
What do you got?

01:58.184 --> 02:00.351
Well, there's this lady
in our office who's retiring,

02:00.353 --> 02:01.519
and they were passing around

02:01.521 --> 02:03.521
one of those big cards
for us to sign...

02:03.523 --> 02:04.589
Okay.

02:04.591 --> 02:06.190
But no one told me she was in

02:06.192 --> 02:07.558
a horrible car accident
over the weekend

02:07.560 --> 02:09.126
and what I
was signing

02:09.127 --> 02:10.428
was not a retirement card

02:10.430 --> 02:12.263
but was actually
a "get well" card.

02:12.265 --> 02:16.467
I'm liking my odds here.

02:16.469 --> 02:18.669
So on the card, in the hospital,

02:18.671 --> 02:22.173
next to the woman who's clinging
to life are the words,

02:22.175 --> 02:24.342
"Hey, Vivian. You deserve this""

02:27.679 --> 02:29.814
"And at least with you gone,

02:29.816 --> 02:32.149
no one will steal my yogurt
out of the fridge."

02:32.151 --> 02:33.951
No!

02:35.354 --> 02:37.455
"LOL. Smiley face."

02:37.457 --> 02:39.223
Oh, my gosh.

02:39.225 --> 02:41.859
"P.S. Good luck
wherever you wind up."

02:43.796 --> 02:47.398
Why didn't I put money on this?

02:47.400 --> 02:49.433
Hey, that's my agent.

02:49.435 --> 02:51.669
If I got the part,
it's still the second best thing

02:51.671 --> 02:53.738
I've heard all day. Hello?

02:53.740 --> 02:55.306
Am I a terrible person?

02:55.308 --> 02:57.375
No. No, it was a mistake.

02:57.377 --> 02:59.577
Am I a terrible person
that it crossed my mind

02:59.579 --> 03:01.579
that she might die
and never see the card?

03:01.581 --> 03:04.148
Now I think
you're flirting with the line.

03:04.150 --> 03:05.783
Good news?

03:05.785 --> 03:07.451
No, I didn't get it.

03:07.453 --> 03:09.020
I'm so sorry.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.788
You'll get offered
something soon.

03:10.790 --> 03:13.024
I kind of did. The part
in that awful horror movie

03:13.026 --> 03:14.659
I passed on came back around.

03:14.661 --> 03:16.661
Apparently,
it's mine if I want it.

03:16.663 --> 03:18.195
Are you gonna take it?

03:18.197 --> 03:19.530
I don't know what to do.

03:19.532 --> 03:22.800
Maybe you'll get hit
by a car and die.

03:24.469 --> 03:26.137
LOL, right?

03:32.911 --> 03:34.245
Hey.

03:34.247 --> 03:36.047
Emily, right?

03:36.049 --> 03:37.081
Yeah...

03:37.083 --> 03:38.649
I-I don't know
if you remember me...

03:38.651 --> 03:40.751
From the dating Web site.

03:40.753 --> 03:43.487
Your friend e-mailed me
because you were afraid to,

03:43.489 --> 03:45.656
then you tracked me down
and acted like a lunatic?

03:45.658 --> 03:47.692
Yes, Rajesh Koothrappali.

03:49.061 --> 03:50.594
Look, uh, I just...

03:50.596 --> 03:53.064
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.699
Okay? You were, like,
the coolest person

03:54.701 --> 03:57.702
I ever found online,
and I got really nervous

03:57.704 --> 03:59.904
and I-I just blew it.

03:59.906 --> 04:02.073
Uh, don't worry about it.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.574
And if it
makes you feel

04:03.576 --> 04:05.576
any better,
you're not the weirdest guy

04:05.578 --> 04:07.111
I've met off the Internet.

04:07.113 --> 04:10.614
Well, give me a chance--
you don't even know me.

04:12.251 --> 04:13.551
All right,

04:13.553 --> 04:15.753
here's your chance.

04:15.755 --> 04:18.154
Wha... Really?

04:19.057 --> 04:20.124
Thank you.

04:20.125 --> 04:21.993
Fate has given me
a rare second chance,

04:21.995 --> 04:24.528
and I swear to Vishnu
I'm not gonna blow it.

04:24.530 --> 04:28.099
Or normal words
followed by a charming smile.

04:32.337 --> 04:35.873
So, first there was
PlayStation-- aka PS1--

04:35.875 --> 04:37.641
then PS2, PS3

04:37.643 --> 04:39.810
and now PS4.
And that makes sense.

04:39.812 --> 04:42.680
You'd think after Xbox,
there'd be Xbox 2.

04:42.682 --> 04:46.117
But no, next came Xbox 360.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.585
Hmm? And now,

04:47.587 --> 04:50.654
after 360, comes Xbox One.

04:50.656 --> 04:52.356
Why "One"?

04:52.358 --> 04:54.458
Maybe that's how many seconds
of thought

04:54.460 --> 04:56.627
they put into naming it.

04:56.629 --> 04:58.462
Can you get the butter, please?

04:58.464 --> 05:00.998
You know, however,
with the Xbox One,

05:01.000 --> 05:03.801
I can control
my entire entertainment system

05:03.803 --> 05:05.036
using voice commands.

05:05.038 --> 05:08.472
Up until now,
I've had to use Leonard.

05:08.474 --> 05:11.142
Then get the other one.
Pass the butter.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.977
Get... Hang on.

05:12.979 --> 05:15.913
I don't feel like you're taking
this dilemma seriously.

05:15.915 --> 05:18.649
Fine, Sheldon.

05:18.651 --> 05:20.651
You have my undivided attention.

05:20.653 --> 05:23.754
Okay, now, the PS4 is

05:23.756 --> 05:25.689
more angular and sleek-looking.

05:25.691 --> 05:27.591
No way.
Yeah, well,

05:27.593 --> 05:30.561
it's true. But the larger size
of the Xbox One

05:30.563 --> 05:32.096
may keep it from overheating.

05:32.098 --> 05:34.231
Well, you wouldn't want
your gaming system to overheat.

05:34.233 --> 05:36.500
No, see? Well, you
absolutely would not.

05:36.502 --> 05:38.369
And furthermore,
the Xbox One

05:38.371 --> 05:40.571
now comes with
a Kinect included.

05:40.573 --> 05:42.740
Included?!
Yes!

05:42.742 --> 05:45.109
Not sold separately.

05:45.111 --> 05:46.477
Although...

05:46.479 --> 05:49.180
the PS4 uses cool new GDDR5 RAM,

05:49.182 --> 05:50.915
while the Xbox One
is still using

05:50.917 --> 05:52.883
the conventional DDR3 memory.

05:52.885 --> 05:54.919
Why would they still
be using DDR3?

05:54.921 --> 05:57.288
Are they nuts?!

05:57.290 --> 05:59.490
See? That's what I thought.

05:59.492 --> 06:02.167
But then they go and throw in
an ESRAM buffer.

06:02.192 --> 06:02.727
Whoa, whoa.

06:02.728 --> 06:05.596
Wait a second. Who's "they"?
Xbox.

06:05.598 --> 06:08.365
You're kidding!
No, I am not!

06:08.367 --> 06:10.301
And this ESRAM buffer
should totally bridge

06:10.303 --> 06:12.169
the 100-gigabit-per-second
bandwidth gap

06:12.171 --> 06:13.637
between the two RAM types.

06:13.639 --> 06:16.140
This is a nightmare. How will
you ever make a decision?

06:16.142 --> 06:17.775
You see?
I don't know!

06:17.777 --> 06:19.009
What should I do?

06:19.011 --> 06:20.478
Please pass the butter!

06:22.000 --> 06:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:29.989 --> 06:33.457
Okay, it's not me, right?
This script is terrible.

06:33.459 --> 06:34.859
Yeah.

06:35.694 --> 06:37.495
I had higher hopes
for a movie called

06:37.497 --> 06:42.199
<i>Serial Ape-ist 2:</i>
<i>Monkey See, Monkey Kill.</i>

06:42.968 --> 06:44.635
You know, it's
still possible

06:44.637 --> 06:46.770
for you to be good
in a bad movie.

06:46.772 --> 06:48.973
Okay.

06:48.975 --> 06:52.042
"Sometimes I feel
like I can control

06:52.044 --> 06:54.078
"the killer gorilla instinct
inside of me,

06:54.080 --> 06:56.714
"but then I see these bananas
and I...

06:56.716 --> 07:00.151
just want to eat them
and then kill people."

07:02.854 --> 07:05.656
What am I gonna do?
Well,

07:05.658 --> 07:07.467
for starters, I wouldn't
eat the bananas.

07:07.492 --> 07:08.326
No...

07:08.327 --> 07:11.996
Come on! This is serious.
Uh, uh,

07:11.998 --> 07:13.497
does it at least pay well?

07:13.499 --> 07:15.533
Less than I was making
at The Cheesecake Factory.

07:15.535 --> 07:17.034
What does your agent think?

07:17.036 --> 07:19.770
She's thinking of taking a job
at The Cheesecake Factory.

07:21.973 --> 07:24.341
You know what, why
don't you just do it?

07:24.343 --> 07:26.577
You'll go have fun for a
few weeks, make some money--

07:26.579 --> 07:28.579
and who knows what
it might lead to?

07:28.581 --> 07:29.847
Okay, look, here, page 58.

07:29.849 --> 07:33.784
I oil-wrestle an orangutan
in a bikini.

07:33.786 --> 07:36.954
Just to clarify, which one
of you is wearing the bikini?

07:36.956 --> 07:39.089
Both of us.

07:40.725 --> 07:42.927
So it's a family film.

07:46.198 --> 07:47.698
Thank you again for dinner.

07:47.700 --> 07:48.899
You're welcome.

07:48.901 --> 07:51.001
Good night.
Uh,

07:51.003 --> 07:52.403
it's date night.

07:52.405 --> 07:56.073
Aren't you, uh,
forgetting something?

07:56.075 --> 07:58.475
Oh, of course.

08:04.983 --> 08:09.253
Did I mention
the PS4 controllers light up?

08:11.256 --> 08:13.257
No.

08:13.259 --> 08:16.093
Well, they do.

08:19.431 --> 08:21.632
And then after coffee,
we went for a walk

08:21.634 --> 08:23.767
and she told me she always
thought people from India

08:23.769 --> 08:25.402
were exotic
and mysterious.

08:25.404 --> 08:28.505
So, with my mouth, I said,
"We're just like anybody else,"

08:28.507 --> 08:29.840
but with my eyes, I said,

08:29.842 --> 08:32.342
"Straight up, Red,
hop on my flying carpet."

08:34.746 --> 08:37.248
So, you gonna
see her again?

08:37.250 --> 08:38.616
Yeah, we have plans
this weekend.

08:38.618 --> 08:39.883
And if it's a clear night,

08:39.885 --> 08:42.785
I'm gonna lay
some romantic astronomy on her.

08:43.621 --> 08:45.322
Okay, like what?
Show me.

08:45.324 --> 08:47.191
I can't do that to Leonard.

08:47.193 --> 08:50.828
This is some powerful
panty-dropping stuff.

08:52.230 --> 08:54.832
You have my blessing. Go for it.

08:54.834 --> 08:57.868
Okay.

08:57.870 --> 09:00.137
Penny,

09:00.139 --> 09:03.507
two of the brightest stars
in the night sky

09:03.509 --> 09:05.476
are Altair and Vega.

09:05.478 --> 09:08.679
And it is said
they were deeply in love

09:08.681 --> 09:10.481
but forever
separated

09:10.483 --> 09:12.950
by the celestial river
of the Milky Way.

09:12.952 --> 09:14.818
Oh, that's sad.
It is.

09:14.820 --> 09:17.121
But once a year,

09:17.123 --> 09:20.291
on the seventh day
of the seventh month,

09:20.293 --> 09:24.895
Vega cries so hard that all
the magpies in the world fly up

09:24.897 --> 09:26.864
and create a bridge
with their wings

09:26.866 --> 09:28.899
so the two lovers
can be together

09:28.901 --> 09:30.834
for a single night

09:30.836 --> 09:32.803
of passion.

09:32.805 --> 09:36.206
Wow.

09:37.842 --> 09:39.910
Okay, that's enough.

09:43.248 --> 09:46.083
Quick poll: PS4 or Xbox One?

09:46.085 --> 09:47.351
Raj.

09:47.353 --> 09:48.752
Uh, Xbox One.
Penny.

09:48.754 --> 09:49.787
Huh?

09:49.789 --> 09:52.122
Leonard.
PS4.

09:52.124 --> 09:54.024
Wolowitz.
Both great.

09:54.026 --> 09:56.694
Bernadette.
I like the Wii.

09:58.063 --> 10:00.197
Thanks, Grandma.

10:02.834 --> 10:05.169
Oh, my goodness.
What's up?

10:05.171 --> 10:07.771
I just got an e-mail
from my ex-girlfriend Lucy.

10:07.773 --> 10:10.307
She... misses me
and wants to get together.

10:10.309 --> 10:12.710
Two women at
the same time?

10:12.712 --> 10:15.512
Nice job, playa!

10:16.348 --> 10:18.082
Really?

10:19.184 --> 10:22.453
Was it the "two women"
thing or the "playa"?

10:23.021 --> 10:24.755
It was the "playa".

10:33.339 --> 10:35.006
What am I
supposed to do?

10:35.008 --> 10:37.642
How am I supposed to choose
between Emily and Lucy?

10:37.644 --> 10:40.078
Why do you have to choose?
Date both of them.

10:40.080 --> 10:42.180
I can't date two women at once.

10:42.182 --> 10:44.416
Zero women--
that's my sweet spot.

10:44.418 --> 10:46.685
Unless you're sleeping

10:46.687 --> 10:49.220
with one of them, seeing
other people isn't a big deal.

10:49.222 --> 10:50.889
But what if one of them asks me

10:50.891 --> 10:52.557
what I was up to
the night before

10:52.559 --> 10:55.193
and I was with the other one?
Then, what, do I lie?

10:55.195 --> 10:56.761
Yes.
Yes.

10:59.031 --> 11:00.899
What do you mean, yes?

11:00.901 --> 11:02.567
What do <i>you</i> mean, yes?

11:02.569 --> 11:04.736
Were you seeing other women
when we started dating?

11:04.738 --> 11:06.404
No. Were you
seeing other men?

11:06.406 --> 11:07.339
No.

11:07.341 --> 11:09.007
Were you seeing
other men?

11:09.009 --> 11:10.675
No.

11:14.647 --> 11:16.815
Aren't you gonna ask me?

11:19.518 --> 11:21.820
Come on, really?

11:24.090 --> 11:26.191
Thank you so much
for letting us pick your brain.

11:26.193 --> 11:27.292
Yeah, happy to help.

11:27.294 --> 11:29.594
So, what's going on?
Well, I'm having

11:29.596 --> 11:31.529
an impossible time getting
my career off the ground,

11:31.531 --> 11:33.798
and I got offered a role
in this crappy horror movie,

11:33.800 --> 11:35.934
and I just don't know
if I should take it.

11:35.936 --> 11:37.902
Well, I have
certainly taken some jobs

11:37.904 --> 11:39.337
that I've been embarrassed by.

11:39.339 --> 11:43.141
I wouldn't exactly
call <i>Star Trek</i> embarrassing.

11:44.176 --> 11:46.511
I wasn't.

11:48.280 --> 11:50.615
Me, either.

11:50.617 --> 11:52.951
So, what do you think,

11:52.953 --> 11:55.286
is there a professional
downside to doing it?

11:55.288 --> 11:56.655
Well, it's tricky.

11:56.657 --> 11:59.524
You want to take projects
that you're excited about,

11:59.526 --> 12:01.926
but sometimes you also
have to pay the bills.

12:01.928 --> 12:04.462
When you're on the set
working on something

12:04.464 --> 12:07.932
that you just know in your heart
is bad-- not <i>Star Trek...</i>

12:09.503 --> 12:13.138
Yeah, beam me up. I love it!

12:14.306 --> 12:17.776
Anyway, those jobs
can be soul-crushing.

12:17.778 --> 12:19.310
That's what I'm afraid of.

12:19.312 --> 12:21.980
Well, I was in <i>Stand By Me</i>
when I was a kid,

12:21.982 --> 12:23.448
and it was a
huge success.

12:23.450 --> 12:25.850
The terrible movies I did
came after that.

12:25.852 --> 12:27.619
I mean, imagine how that feels.

12:27.621 --> 12:29.354
Sounds rough.

12:29.356 --> 12:31.589
I'm telling you,
this business is brutal.

12:31.591 --> 12:34.626
To this day,
I hate going on auditions.

12:34.628 --> 12:36.494
Okay, I walk in,
and I can just

12:36.496 --> 12:39.030
feel them thinking...

12:39.032 --> 12:42.867
"He was such a cute kid.
What happened to him?"

12:45.037 --> 12:46.571
And then I don't get the job,

12:46.573 --> 12:49.307
and I can never
find out why.

12:50.476 --> 12:53.545
Honestly, I get so depressed,
there are entire weeks

12:53.547 --> 12:56.681
that I can't even
get out of bed.

12:58.384 --> 13:00.652
Okay, this was helpful.

13:04.156 --> 13:06.858
Any news on your coworker
who's in the hospital?

13:06.860 --> 13:09.661
Poor thing, she was
in surgery for 18 hours.

13:09.663 --> 13:12.130
She's alive, but she's
still in critical condition.

13:12.132 --> 13:13.264
Oh, no.

13:13.266 --> 13:15.333
The one bit of good news
is they put her

13:15.335 --> 13:17.469
in a medically induced coma
before she read the card.

13:17.471 --> 13:19.871
So, you know,
silver linings.

13:22.875 --> 13:26.010
Were you like this
when I married you?

13:28.180 --> 13:30.515
Don't worry
about it, buddy.

13:30.517 --> 13:32.650
Okay, bye.

13:32.652 --> 13:34.285
That was Wil--
he's feeling a lot better.

13:34.287 --> 13:37.956
Apparently, he's 12-down in
the <i>TV Guide</i> crossword puzzle.

13:39.692 --> 13:41.726
Did he help you make a decision
about the movie?

13:41.728 --> 13:42.927
No. Did you figure out

13:42.929 --> 13:44.896
what you're gonna do
about the two girls?

13:44.898 --> 13:46.231
As a matter of fact, I did.

13:46.233 --> 13:47.699
I've spent
so many years

13:47.701 --> 13:50.735
living in fear,
saying no to new experiences,

13:50.737 --> 13:52.036
but from now on,

13:52.038 --> 13:53.805
I'm gonna say yes--
yes to love,

13:53.807 --> 13:56.307
yes to adventure, yes to life;
whatever it may be,

13:56.309 --> 13:58.009
the answer's going to be yes.

13:58.844 --> 14:00.478
He's gonna die alone, right?

14:00.480 --> 14:02.013
Yeah.
Yes.

14:04.483 --> 14:06.151
I'm proud of
you, Sheldon.

14:06.153 --> 14:07.919
You know, I'm proud of me, too.

14:07.921 --> 14:11.623
I've done all my research,
I conducted an informal poll,

14:11.625 --> 14:13.458
and I've arrived
at the rock-solid certainty

14:13.460 --> 14:14.793
I've made
the right choice.

14:14.795 --> 14:16.298
Well, that's got to be
a good feeling.

14:16.323 --> 14:17.930
Oh, it is.

14:17.931 --> 14:19.964
Although...
Oh, crap.

14:21.133 --> 14:24.836
I had the same feeling when
I made my dad buy a Betamax

14:24.838 --> 14:26.571
instead of a VHS.

14:26.573 --> 14:28.640
You were just a little kid.

14:28.642 --> 14:30.542
Yeah, a little kid
who picked the wrong format

14:30.544 --> 14:33.077
to record
<i>The MacNeil/Lehrer Report.</i>

14:34.146 --> 14:35.580
I also was certain

14:35.582 --> 14:38.449
that HD DVD would win out
over Blu-ray.

14:38.451 --> 14:40.718
How old were you then?
Old enough to know better.

14:42.688 --> 14:44.589
You know, and now that
I think about it,

14:44.591 --> 14:46.524
I stood in front of
a case of iPods

14:46.526 --> 14:49.460
and I bought a Zune.

14:50.963 --> 14:52.397
What's a Zune?

14:52.399 --> 14:54.332
Yeah, exactly.

14:55.401 --> 14:56.968
It's an MP3 player

14:56.970 --> 14:58.937
brought to us
by the makers of Xbox.

14:58.939 --> 15:01.239
What... no, what are you doing?

15:01.241 --> 15:02.440
No, no, pick
that back up.

15:02.442 --> 15:04.509
You know it's good.
You did the research.

15:04.511 --> 15:05.977
But what if I'm wrong?

15:05.979 --> 15:07.745
You know what?

15:07.747 --> 15:10.048
How about I buy
it for you?

15:10.050 --> 15:11.349
How about

15:11.351 --> 15:13.251
I buy you both?

15:13.253 --> 15:15.153
You know I only have
one slot available

15:15.155 --> 15:16.454
in my entertainment center.

15:16.456 --> 15:18.623
Then I'll buy you a new
entertainment center.

15:18.625 --> 15:19.824
Well, yeah... okay, sure.

15:19.826 --> 15:22.660
But which one?

15:22.662 --> 15:24.262
How about this?

15:24.264 --> 15:25.897
I've heard

15:25.899 --> 15:27.165
that if you flip a coin,

15:27.167 --> 15:28.867
it will tell you how
you actually feel.

15:28.869 --> 15:30.335
Because you'll either
be disappointed

15:30.337 --> 15:31.803
or excited by the outcome.

15:31.805 --> 15:33.471
Interesting.

15:33.473 --> 15:36.975
So, heads it's PS4,
tails it's Xbox One.

15:38.310 --> 15:39.978
All right, I'll try.

15:44.149 --> 15:45.149
What is it?

15:45.151 --> 15:46.351
A quarter.

15:51.023 --> 15:52.523
Could have given
it back to me.

15:52.525 --> 15:54.292
That was a choice.

16:00.634 --> 16:02.333
You look...

16:02.335 --> 16:03.902
you look really pretty tonight.

16:03.904 --> 16:05.236
Thanks.

16:05.238 --> 16:06.204
I love that jacket.

16:06.206 --> 16:07.939
Thank you.
Thanks, thanks.

16:10.409 --> 16:12.410
I'm sorry. I can't do this.

16:12.412 --> 16:14.345
My... my ex-girlfriend
e-mailed me,

16:14.347 --> 16:15.947
and I'm seeing her Saturday...

16:15.949 --> 16:19.717
And I'm glad you like it--
it's from J. Crew.

16:20.653 --> 16:22.320
I don't understand.

16:22.322 --> 16:23.721
My friends told me it was okay

16:23.723 --> 16:25.556
to see more than
one person at a time,

16:25.558 --> 16:27.225
but it-it feels like
I'm being deceitful.

16:27.227 --> 16:29.060
Are you getting
back together with her?

16:29.062 --> 16:30.361
No.

16:30.363 --> 16:32.130
I-I... I have no idea.

16:32.132 --> 16:33.498
What would you do?

16:33.500 --> 16:37.969
Uh, usually on first dates,
I talk about music and stuff,

16:37.971 --> 16:40.705
but I was promised weird,
so let's do this.

16:41.840 --> 16:43.574
How serious were you two?

16:43.576 --> 16:46.177
Well, to be honest,

16:46.179 --> 16:49.580
we only went on four dates,
hugged twice, kissed once,

16:49.582 --> 16:53.251
and there was a handshake
loaded with sexual innuendo.

16:56.155 --> 16:57.655
Wait, so...

16:57.657 --> 16:59.824
a girl you never slept with
sent you an e-mail

16:59.826 --> 17:02.527
and you felt so guilty about it
that you had to tell me?

17:02.529 --> 17:03.661
Yeah.

17:03.663 --> 17:06.396
That's kind of adorable.

17:06.398 --> 17:08.465
Are you... are you sure?

17:08.468 --> 17:10.101
Because this is
the part of the night

17:10.103 --> 17:12.270
where I've said something stupid
and the girl usually leaves.

17:12.271 --> 17:13.604
I'm still here.

17:13.606 --> 17:17.375
Yeah, but now you make me wonder
what's wrong with you.

17:18.711 --> 17:20.377
We just met.

17:20.380 --> 17:22.880
You don't need to tell me about
other people you're seeing.

17:22.882 --> 17:24.816
Really?
Mm-hmm.

17:24.818 --> 17:26.951
Because "I'm dating two women"

17:26.953 --> 17:30.254
is basically the only cool
thing I can say about myself.

17:41.166 --> 17:44.969
On the one hand, the Xbox One
has a better camera...

17:44.971 --> 17:48.806
but the PS4 has
a removable hard drive.

17:48.808 --> 17:51.109
Thoughts?

17:51.111 --> 17:53.311
I can't feel
my legs.

17:56.048 --> 17:57.882
Oh... I'm sorry, guys,

17:57.884 --> 17:59.484
but the store closed
five minutes ago.

17:59.486 --> 18:02.020
But I haven't
decided yet.

18:02.022 --> 18:03.354
You'll have to come
back tomorrow.

18:03.356 --> 18:04.856
The registers are closed.

18:08.862 --> 18:10.962
Let's get you
some food.

18:10.964 --> 18:12.363
Y-You'll feel better
after you eat.

18:12.365 --> 18:14.599
Okay.

18:14.601 --> 18:16.734
What-what do you want,
like, Thai food?

18:16.736 --> 18:18.403
A... a burger?

18:18.405 --> 18:20.671
I don't know!

18:31.550 --> 18:33.785
Hey, look, a quarter!

18:47.067 --> 18:48.378
How's that feel?

18:48.379 --> 18:49.544
Great.

18:49.546 --> 18:51.947
Not like regret at all.

18:53.449 --> 18:55.884
Penny?

18:55.886 --> 18:57.386
We're working together!

18:58.703 --> 19:00.136
Awesome!
