WEBVTT

00:09.092 --> 00:10.886
Leaving so soon, cadet?

00:10.928 --> 00:13.263
Sir, by statue 614

00:10.928 --> 00:13.263
of the Alabama Legal Code,

00:13.305 --> 00:16.224
I am officially emancipated

00:13.305 --> 00:16.224
and considered an adult,

00:16.266 --> 00:17.768
an adult who no

00:16.266 --> 00:17.768
longer chooses

00:17.810 --> 00:19.060
to attend Marlin Academy.

00:19.102 --> 00:21.104
I have copies of

00:19.102 --> 00:21.104
the documents here,

00:21.146 --> 00:22.690
if you want to

00:21.146 --> 00:22.690
see them again.

00:22.731 --> 00:24.566
Oh, no need.

00:24.608 --> 00:27.027
I'm sure that everything

00:24.608 --> 00:27.027
was done on the up-and-up.

00:28.111 --> 00:31.365
Let me tell you something,

00:28.111 --> 00:31.365
cadet.

00:31.406 --> 00:34.576
In all my years at this Academy,

00:34.618 --> 00:39.080
I have never had a student

00:34.618 --> 00:39.080
who was more bullheaded,

00:39.122 --> 00:42.501
more committed to avoid

00:39.122 --> 00:42.501
learning at all costs,

00:42.543 --> 00:48.340
a cadet whose constant byword

00:42.543 --> 00:48.340
was "insubordination."

00:48.382 --> 00:51.677
Thank you, cadet.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.094
What?

00:53.136 --> 00:55.931
Before you came to this academy,

00:55.973 --> 01:00.561
I was bored, uninspired

00:55.973 --> 01:00.561
and this close to retiring,

01:00.602 --> 01:03.146
but your insolence and stupidity

01:03.188 --> 01:05.106
have been the irritating

01:03.188 --> 01:05.106
grain of sand

01:05.148 --> 01:09.778
around which has formed

01:05.148 --> 01:09.778
the pearl of my renaissance.

01:09.820 --> 01:12.113
I like me again.

01:12.155 --> 01:13.949
Cadet!

01:16.451 --> 01:20.873
As a thanks,

01:16.451 --> 01:20.873
I want you to have this.

01:24.209 --> 01:26.127
Normally, these are reserved

01:26.169 --> 01:27.755
for cadets who have

01:26.169 --> 01:27.755
distinguished themselves,

01:27.796 --> 01:30.549
or whose parents have

01:27.796 --> 01:30.549
donated a building,

01:30.591 --> 01:33.176
but you've left your mark here

01:30.591 --> 01:33.176
in your own way,

01:33.218 --> 01:35.512
so what the heck?

01:35.554 --> 01:39.182
Wow. Sir, this is great.

01:39.224 --> 01:40.809
Farewell, cadet.

01:40.851 --> 01:43.311
Thank you so much.

01:40.851 --> 01:43.311
Now,

01:43.353 --> 01:44.479
careful, that's razor...

01:47.900 --> 01:50.110

02:32.235 --> 02:34.279
My mom's been on such a rampage

02:32.235 --> 02:34.279
about Francis,

02:34.321 --> 02:36.824
it's actually a relief

02:34.321 --> 02:36.824
to get out of the house.

02:36.865 --> 02:38.199
Thank God!

02:38.241 --> 02:41.078
Summer's over.

02:41.120 --> 02:42.496
REESE:

02:41.120 --> 02:42.496
Hello, babies.

02:42.537 --> 02:44.414
How's baby school,

02:42.537 --> 02:44.414
babies?

02:44.456 --> 02:46.834
Didn't high school start,

02:44.456 --> 02:46.834
like, a half hour ago?

02:46.875 --> 02:48.209
Hey, if I'm on time today

02:48.251 --> 02:49.920
they're going to expect it

02:48.251 --> 02:49.920
every day.

02:49.962 --> 02:52.255
Ow! Ow! Ow!

02:52.297 --> 02:54.257
Hi, Reese.

02:52.297 --> 02:54.257
This is Gus.

02:54.299 --> 02:55.884
He's in the lead

02:55.926 --> 02:58.679
to replace you

02:55.926 --> 02:58.679
as school bully.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.931
He gives a wedgie

02:58.720 --> 03:00.931
that'll knock

02:58.720 --> 03:00.931
your socks off.

03:00.973 --> 03:02.099
I'm not just

03:00.973 --> 03:02.099
saying that

03:02.141 --> 03:03.642
'cause he's got

03:02.141 --> 03:03.642
me in a headlock.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.811
If you grab your wrist

03:03.684 --> 03:05.811
instead of your fingers,

03:05.853 --> 03:07.104
you'll get better leverage.

03:07.146 --> 03:09.481
You listen to him.

03:07.146 --> 03:09.481
He's the man.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.108
(grunts)

03:13.986 --> 03:15.863
I've completed the research

03:13.986 --> 03:15.863
on our new teacher,

03:15.904 --> 03:17.489
if anyone's interested.

03:19.366 --> 03:23.328
Lionel Herkabe,

03:19.366 --> 03:23.328
born July 8, 1963.

03:23.370 --> 03:25.080
Parents-- John and Ida.

03:25.122 --> 03:26.832
Notice anything?

03:26.874 --> 03:28.876
He was a Krelboyne.

03:28.917 --> 03:30.502
We won't have

03:28.917 --> 03:30.502
to talk down to him.

03:30.544 --> 03:33.755
Finally, someone

03:30.544 --> 03:33.755
who knows our pain.

03:33.797 --> 03:36.675
"Bentley Gifted High,

03:33.797 --> 03:36.675
Princeton, Harvard Business."

03:36.717 --> 03:38.301
What's this guy

03:36.717 --> 03:38.301
doing teaching?

03:38.343 --> 03:40.512
Well, there was

03:38.343 --> 03:40.512
some unpleasantness.

03:40.554 --> 03:44.516
He quit a government think tank

03:40.554 --> 03:44.516
to start a dot-com.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.727
(all groan)

03:44.558 --> 03:46.727
(whistles)

03:46.768 --> 03:49.146
One-time net worth $200 million,

03:49.188 --> 03:50.898
Now $137.

03:50.939 --> 03:52.983
(gasping)

03:53.025 --> 03:55.569
Here he comes! Here he comes!

03:55.610 --> 03:57.696
Hurry up.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.322
Get out of my way.

04:23.847 --> 04:25.306
Who's Dabney?

04:25.348 --> 04:26.307
That's me, sir.

04:26.349 --> 04:29.019
I took the liberty of ordering

04:26.349 --> 04:29.019
you a decaf soy latte.

04:29.061 --> 04:31.188
Let me guess.

04:31.230 --> 04:34.691
Emotionally needy,

04:31.230 --> 04:34.691
closet bed-wetter...

04:34.733 --> 04:37.527
you get no affection at home

04:34.733 --> 04:37.527
so you'll be seeking it from me.

04:37.569 --> 04:39.654
Look elsewhere, son.

04:41.073 --> 04:43.283
Who's the anal-retentive

04:41.073 --> 04:43.283
outsider?

04:44.451 --> 04:48.329
With repressed matricidal

04:44.451 --> 04:48.329
tendencies?

04:48.371 --> 04:51.083
It was from me, sir!

04:48.371 --> 04:51.083
Please, stop.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.128
As you may or may not know,

04:54.169 --> 04:56.337
I was once one of you...

04:54.169 --> 04:56.337
a Krelboyne,

04:56.379 --> 04:58.173
and I'm sure I would have made

04:56.379 --> 04:58.173
the same

04:58.215 --> 05:00.217
lame attempt

04:58.215 --> 05:00.217
to ingratiate myself

05:00.259 --> 05:03.262
to the new, soft-headed thickwit

05:00.259 --> 05:03.262
teaching my class.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.930
Oh, yes,

05:03.303 --> 05:04.930
I've been there.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.348
I have been coddled and preened.

05:07.390 --> 05:09.935
"Oh, you're a genius.

05:07.390 --> 05:09.935
You can do anything

05:09.977 --> 05:11.061
"you set your mind to.

05:11.103 --> 05:14.022
It must be so easy being you."

05:14.064 --> 05:14.982
Well, bull ...!

05:15.023 --> 05:16.775
(all gasp)

05:16.817 --> 05:20.612
All that gets you is an ex-wife

05:16.817 --> 05:20.612
and $14 million in debt.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.739
Now I refuse to let you fall

05:20.654 --> 05:22.739
into the trap

05:22.781 --> 05:23.949
society has set for you.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.826
Playtime is over children.

05:25.867 --> 05:28.078
You've had a free ride so far.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.831
It's about time somebody

05:28.120 --> 05:30.831
motivated you, challenged you,

05:30.872 --> 05:32.958
tested your mental limits.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.042
Granted, I don't have

05:34.084 --> 05:35.376
a teaching certificate

05:35.418 --> 05:36.670
from a two-year

05:35.418 --> 05:36.670
community college

05:36.711 --> 05:39.089
like most of the people

05:36.711 --> 05:39.089
I was forced to say hello to

05:39.131 --> 05:40.841
this morning

05:39.131 --> 05:40.841
in the teachers lounge,

05:40.882 --> 05:43.468
but, you know, I'm just going

05:40.882 --> 05:43.468
to try to muddle through

05:43.510 --> 05:46.054
with my double doctorate

05:43.510 --> 05:46.054
from Harvard.

05:46.096 --> 05:48.223
This is a test.

05:48.265 --> 05:49.390
Correct. You have 20 minutes.

05:49.432 --> 05:51.392
There are six

05:49.432 --> 05:51.392
essay questions.

05:51.434 --> 05:54.395
I'm sorry. I thought this was

05:51.434 --> 05:54.395
the gifted class.

05:54.437 --> 05:55.897
Begin!

06:09.161 --> 06:10.704
Thanks for the ride.

06:10.745 --> 06:12.831
Are you sure

06:10.745 --> 06:12.831
about this Alaska thing?

06:12.873 --> 06:14.041
Oh, absolutely.

06:14.082 --> 06:15.083
I don't know.

06:15.125 --> 06:16.584
I heard Alaska's supposed

06:15.125 --> 06:16.584
to be a hole.

06:16.626 --> 06:17.627
Are you kidding?

06:17.669 --> 06:19.254
Cruise ships go up there.

06:19.296 --> 06:21.089
Only for about six weeks

06:19.296 --> 06:21.089
in the summer.

06:21.131 --> 06:22.799
Isn't it dark there

06:21.131 --> 06:22.799
the rest of the year?

06:22.841 --> 06:25.426
I don't have to justify

06:22.841 --> 06:25.426
myself to you.

06:25.468 --> 06:27.804
I don't have to justify

06:25.468 --> 06:27.804
myself to anyone.

06:27.846 --> 06:29.514
That's why

06:27.846 --> 06:29.514
I got emancipated, okay?

06:29.556 --> 06:31.141
Okay.

06:31.183 --> 06:33.352
Good luck with your parents.

06:33.392 --> 06:35.103
Yeah, well, they had

06:33.392 --> 06:35.103
a week to think about it.

06:35.145 --> 06:36.355
We'll see how they take it.

06:37.647 --> 06:39.900
(growling)

06:41.318 --> 06:42.610
(shrieks)

06:42.652 --> 06:44.445
You...!

06:44.487 --> 06:48.449
(screaming)

06:44.487 --> 06:48.449
(growling)

06:48.491 --> 06:50.369
You ungrateful

06:48.491 --> 06:50.369
son of a...!

06:54.164 --> 06:55.916
This wasn't meant

06:54.164 --> 06:55.916
to hurt you!

06:55.957 --> 06:58.377
After all we've done!

07:05.424 --> 07:07.094
(screams)

07:13.892 --> 07:16.353
All I'm saying

07:13.892 --> 07:16.353
is that you can get

07:13.892 --> 07:16.353
your diploma first

07:16.395 --> 07:17.771
and then do

07:16.395 --> 07:17.771
what you want.

07:17.812 --> 07:20.481
It's all about maximizing

07:17.812 --> 07:20.481
your options,

07:20.523 --> 07:22.734
taking the long view.

07:22.776 --> 07:25.070
Sorry about using

07:22.776 --> 07:25.070
"The Closer."

07:25.112 --> 07:26.113
Nonsense.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.488
I wouldn't have

07:26.154 --> 07:27.488
taught it to you

07:27.530 --> 07:28.865
if I didn't want

07:27.530 --> 07:28.865
you to use it.

07:28.907 --> 07:30.200
Listen, what do

07:28.907 --> 07:30.200
I always say?

07:30.242 --> 07:31.201
"The nards

07:30.242 --> 07:31.201
are fair game."

07:31.243 --> 07:34.413
The nards are fair game.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.914
Look, sometimes

07:34.454 --> 07:35.914
you're presented

07:35.956 --> 07:37.582
with an opportunity

07:35.956 --> 07:37.582
that you just can't pass up.

07:37.624 --> 07:39.500
I hope you understand.

07:39.542 --> 07:40.710
I'm not the one you

07:39.542 --> 07:40.710
have to worry about.

07:40.752 --> 07:42.087
I know. And I want

07:42.129 --> 07:43.380
to get this straight

07:42.129 --> 07:43.380
with Mom.

07:43.422 --> 07:45.173
That's why I came here.

07:45.215 --> 07:46.507
Okay then.

07:46.549 --> 07:47.467
Honey?

07:49.386 --> 07:52.347
Um, your son has something

07:49.386 --> 07:52.347
to say to you.

07:54.557 --> 07:55.516
Huh? I didn't know

07:55.558 --> 07:57.477
the Hendersons painted

07:55.558 --> 07:57.477
their house.

08:04.359 --> 08:06.611
(bell ringing)

08:09.239 --> 08:11.532
Well, I have your test results.

08:11.574 --> 08:12.826
You all got As.

08:14.577 --> 08:16.997
But, since this is

08:14.577 --> 08:16.997
the  gifted  class,

08:17.038 --> 08:20.125
I also factored in

08:17.038 --> 08:20.125
cogency of argument,

08:20.167 --> 08:21.542
economy of language

08:21.584 --> 08:25.422
and penmanship,

08:21.584 --> 08:25.422
which enabled me to do this.

08:26.589 --> 08:27.590
What is that?

08:27.632 --> 08:28.842
A ranking board.

08:28.883 --> 08:30.551
But I thought you said

08:28.883 --> 08:30.551
we all got As.

08:30.593 --> 08:31.594
Oh, you did.

08:31.636 --> 08:34.639
But some of you got better As

08:31.636 --> 08:34.639
than others.

08:34.681 --> 08:36.557
But we all still have As?

08:36.599 --> 08:38.559
Of course.

08:38.601 --> 08:40.187
So, what does

08:38.601 --> 08:40.187
being number one get you?

08:40.228 --> 08:41.729
Nothing.

08:41.771 --> 08:44.024
Just the knowledge that you...

08:44.065 --> 08:45.566
are number one.

08:45.608 --> 08:47.486
Or that you are not...

08:47.527 --> 08:48.778
number one.

08:50.613 --> 08:51.823
Yes, Number Five.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.367
It's Dabney, sir.

08:53.408 --> 08:54.826
I know.

08:53.408 --> 08:54.826
What is it, Number Five?

08:54.868 --> 08:56.870
I forgot.

08:59.539 --> 09:02.417
What... a jerk.

09:02.459 --> 09:04.252
Is that what we're

09:02.459 --> 09:04.252
going to turn out like?

09:04.294 --> 09:06.171
If I ever start

09:04.294 --> 09:06.171
acting like that,

09:06.213 --> 09:08.006
you have to promise

09:06.213 --> 09:08.006
to kill me.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.175
No, no more death pacts.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.592
Don't worry about it.

09:11.634 --> 09:13.011
The only way

09:11.634 --> 09:13.011
that stupid board

09:13.053 --> 09:15.055
can have an effect

09:13.053 --> 09:15.055
on us is if we let it.

09:15.096 --> 09:16.515
Those numbers mean nothing.

09:18.641 --> 09:19.809
What are...

09:19.851 --> 09:21.019
you doing?

09:21.061 --> 09:22.603
Nothing.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.314
You were studying?

09:24.356 --> 09:25.482
No, I wasn't.

09:25.524 --> 09:28.151
My book just fell open

09:25.524 --> 09:28.151
to this page.

09:29.361 --> 09:32.864
You know,

09:29.361 --> 09:32.864
I'm really not hungry.

09:32.906 --> 09:36.326
I think I left

09:32.906 --> 09:36.326
my recess stuff in my locker.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.997
Oh, my God,

09:39.079 --> 09:40.997
high school is awesome.

09:41.039 --> 09:43.624
They have an entire room

09:41.039 --> 09:43.624
just for detention.

09:43.666 --> 09:45.668
They put you in

09:43.666 --> 09:45.668
with juniors and seniors.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.337
Some of them have records.

09:47.379 --> 09:49.506
It's really inspiring.

09:49.548 --> 09:51.508
What are you looking at?

09:51.550 --> 09:52.633
Francis.

09:52.675 --> 09:54.886
He's still out there?

09:54.928 --> 09:56.637
Yeah, he's eating

09:54.928 --> 09:56.637
out of the bird feeder.

09:56.679 --> 09:58.306
LOIS:

09:56.679 --> 09:58.306
Whose shoes are these?

09:58.348 --> 10:00.892
Who left their shoes

09:58.348 --> 10:00.892
in the living room?

10:00.934 --> 10:02.269
Those are mine-- I'm sorry.

10:02.310 --> 10:03.562
You're right

10:02.310 --> 10:03.562
you're sorry.

10:03.603 --> 10:04.687
Leaving your shoes around

10:03.603 --> 10:04.687
like you,

10:04.729 --> 10:06.647
like you don't even

10:04.729 --> 10:06.647
care about them.

10:06.689 --> 10:09.109
I hope you like walking

10:06.689 --> 10:09.109
to school in your socks!

10:09.150 --> 10:10.651
I said I'm sorry.

10:10.693 --> 10:12.529
Well, I've heard sorry before.

10:12.571 --> 10:13.863
I don't think so.

10:13.905 --> 10:16.908
Okay, tell you

10:13.905 --> 10:16.908
what we're going to do.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.659
From now on,

10:18.701 --> 10:20.328
when you want

10:18.701 --> 10:20.328
to wear shoes,

10:20.370 --> 10:21.662
you check them out.

10:21.704 --> 10:23.373
Sign them in,

10:21.704 --> 10:23.373
sign them out.

10:23.415 --> 10:25.666
Just like a library.

10:28.086 --> 10:29.629
Clean up those toys!

10:31.590 --> 10:33.633
(knocking)

10:44.352 --> 10:45.479
Oh, thanks.

10:45.520 --> 10:46.687
It is freezing out there.

10:46.729 --> 10:47.772
Hey, it's good

10:46.729 --> 10:47.772
to see you guys.

10:47.814 --> 10:48.940
I really missed you.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.066
(grunts)

10:50.108 --> 10:51.943
What was that for?

10:51.985 --> 10:53.153
Emancipation?

10:53.194 --> 10:55.196
What, you're divorcing

10:53.194 --> 10:55.196
the family now?

10:55.238 --> 10:56.990
How could you do this to Mom?

10:57.031 --> 10:59.534
She left me no choice.

10:59.576 --> 11:00.868
Ow!

11:00.910 --> 11:02.745
We've done a lot

11:00.910 --> 11:02.745
of bad things to Mom,

11:02.787 --> 11:04.581
but we would never abandon her.

11:04.623 --> 11:05.957
I'm not abandoning her.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.708
I'm just going to Alaska.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.544
That's 5,000 miles away.

11:09.586 --> 11:10.711
It is not...

11:10.753 --> 11:12.130
5,000 miles,

11:10.753 --> 11:12.130
are you serious?

11:12.172 --> 11:13.714
Oh, my God, it's going

11:13.756 --> 11:15.592
to take me forever

11:13.756 --> 11:15.592
to get up there.

11:15.634 --> 11:16.717
Then don't go.

11:16.759 --> 11:18.136
Guys, you have to understand.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.929
I'm not doing this

11:18.178 --> 11:19.929
to hurt anybody.

11:19.971 --> 11:21.640
I just... I really think

11:21.680 --> 11:24.184
this is my best chance

11:21.680 --> 11:24.184
to make something of myself.

11:24.225 --> 11:25.393
Tell it to Mom.

11:25.435 --> 11:27.228
I can't, she

11:25.435 --> 11:27.228
won't talk to me.

11:27.270 --> 11:28.813
She is being

11:27.270 --> 11:28.813
so immature.

11:28.855 --> 11:32.400
In the meantime, I'm stuck

11:28.855 --> 11:32.400
outside in the freezing cold.

11:33.776 --> 11:35.820
Would it be all right

11:33.776 --> 11:35.820
if I slept in here tonight?

11:40.699 --> 11:41.784
Certainly, the whale

11:41.826 --> 11:44.162
represents

11:41.826 --> 11:44.162
the search for God...

11:44.204 --> 11:45.830
but that could be limiting.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.332
We could say it was

11:47.374 --> 11:49.000
the search

11:47.374 --> 11:49.000
for the self.

11:49.042 --> 11:49.959
Melville could be

11:50.001 --> 11:51.961
considered a pre-existentialist.

11:54.797 --> 11:56.007
But you can't deny

11:56.049 --> 11:58.259
that the whale could also

11:56.049 --> 11:58.259
be the search for truth

11:58.301 --> 11:59.760
which has been

11:58.301 --> 11:59.760
a theme throughout

11:59.802 --> 12:00.845
his whole oeuvre.

12:05.642 --> 12:09.770
But we can't overlook the fact

12:05.642 --> 12:09.770
that it is an actual whale,

12:09.812 --> 12:12.440
which was the

12:09.812 --> 12:12.440
biggest industry

12:09.812 --> 12:12.440
in the 19th century.

12:12.482 --> 12:13.774
The oil was

12:12.482 --> 12:13.774
used in lamps,

12:13.816 --> 12:15.734
soaps and even cosmetics.

12:18.863 --> 12:22.783
Today, whaling is outlawed,

12:18.863 --> 12:22.783
but many Aleutian islanders

12:22.825 --> 12:26.787
are legally allowed

12:22.825 --> 12:26.787
to harvest whales

12:26.829 --> 12:29.290
for ritual purposes.

12:29.999 --> 12:32.460
But I digress!

12:32.502 --> 12:34.421
(whimpering)

12:34.462 --> 12:37.798
Wow, nine places.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.634
That's got to be a record.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.096
Okay, on to new business.

12:43.137 --> 12:45.473
This Friday,

12:43.137 --> 12:45.473
Principal Littledove

12:45.515 --> 12:47.975
will be dropping by

12:45.515 --> 12:47.975
for a little evaluation.

12:48.017 --> 12:50.395
I think he'll be very impressed

12:48.017 --> 12:50.395
with what he sees.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.980
I don't think

12:50.437 --> 12:52.980
he'll understand it,

12:53.022 --> 12:54.815
but I think his tiny brain

12:54.857 --> 12:57.860
will have the dim perception

12:54.857 --> 12:57.860
of the progress you can make

12:57.902 --> 13:01.864
when students

12:57.902 --> 13:01.864
are properly motivated.

13:01.906 --> 13:03.824
Now, who would like

13:01.906 --> 13:03.824
to sink their teeth

13:03.866 --> 13:05.285
into some

13:03.866 --> 13:05.285
Bernoulli equations?

13:10.039 --> 13:11.291
Come on, guys.

13:11.332 --> 13:12.459
Look at yourselves.

13:12.500 --> 13:13.710
If we don't let those

13:13.752 --> 13:15.712
stupid rankings get to us,

13:13.752 --> 13:15.712
they mean nothing.

13:15.754 --> 13:18.214
Easy for you

13:15.754 --> 13:18.214
to say, Number One.

13:18.256 --> 13:19.507
I have a name.

13:19.549 --> 13:21.134
We all have names!

13:21.175 --> 13:24.011
Oh, my God,

13:21.175 --> 13:24.011
I can't remember mine!

13:24.053 --> 13:25.555
MALCOLM:

13:24.053 --> 13:25.555
This is ridiculous!

13:25.597 --> 13:28.433
School used to be the one place

13:25.597 --> 13:28.433
where you were truly happy,

13:28.475 --> 13:30.393
and Herkabe has taken that

13:28.475 --> 13:30.393
away from you.

13:31.102 --> 13:32.228
That stupid board

13:32.270 --> 13:33.229
is ruining our lives.

13:33.271 --> 13:34.439
We can't let him do that.

13:34.481 --> 13:37.358
What choice... do we have?

13:37.400 --> 13:39.944
We have the choice that

13:37.400 --> 13:39.944
people have had for centuries.

13:39.986 --> 13:42.238
We can choose to fail.

13:42.280 --> 13:43.906
Like the French?

13:43.948 --> 13:47.952
You mean... we tank...

13:43.948 --> 13:47.952
today's test?

13:47.994 --> 13:50.079
No, we don't tank it.

13:50.121 --> 13:51.790
We nuke it.

13:52.707 --> 13:54.292
Every answer wrong.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.876
No complete sentences.

13:55.918 --> 13:57.878
No punctuation.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.881
And we use number three pencils.

14:00.923 --> 14:01.716
(gasping)

14:01.758 --> 14:03.050
You can't rank zeros!

14:03.092 --> 14:04.177
That's brilliant!

14:04.218 --> 14:05.261
He'll have no choice

14:05.303 --> 14:07.138
but to throw out

14:05.303 --> 14:07.138
his stupid system!

14:07.180 --> 14:08.889
We'll be free!

14:08.931 --> 14:11.434
(cheering)

14:15.730 --> 14:17.898
I'm very disappointed in you.

14:17.940 --> 14:20.777
Everyone else, nice job.

14:35.875 --> 14:36.917
(softly):

14:35.875 --> 14:36.917
I'm sorry.

14:36.959 --> 14:38.919
(softly):

14:36.959 --> 14:38.919
I'm sorry.

14:38.961 --> 14:40.338
I tried.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.382
My hand wouldn't let me.

14:42.423 --> 14:45.552
I regret...

14:45.593 --> 14:46.927
nothing.

14:46.969 --> 14:48.929
Interesting gambit, but I guess

14:48.971 --> 14:51.932
the Lemmings didn't follow you

14:48.971 --> 14:51.932
off the cliff.

14:51.974 --> 14:54.185
When you've spent some time

14:51.974 --> 14:54.185
in the real world,

14:54.227 --> 14:58.022
you'll realize you can't fight

14:54.227 --> 14:58.022
the system, and now...

14:58.064 --> 14:59.691
I'm  the system.

15:12.078 --> 15:13.204
(exasperated sigh)

15:15.874 --> 15:17.792
Don't worry,

15:15.874 --> 15:17.792
I just let the air out.

15:17.834 --> 15:19.960
We can talk

15:17.834 --> 15:19.960
while I put on your spare.

15:20.002 --> 15:22.046
Look, I'm sorry I had

15:20.002 --> 15:22.046
to resort to this,

15:22.088 --> 15:25.383
but you have to give me

15:22.088 --> 15:25.383
five minutes so we can talk.

15:25.425 --> 15:26.384
(engine starts)

15:26.426 --> 15:27.343
(music blaring)

15:27.385 --> 15:29.596
(yelling):

15:27.385 --> 15:29.596
I can talk over the music!

15:31.013 --> 15:32.807
You can't drive on a flat!

15:34.016 --> 15:36.310
You're going to ruin your rims!

15:39.021 --> 15:40.440
(tires squealing)

15:40.481 --> 15:42.650
That was a red light!

15:43.943 --> 15:45.653
You might want to notice

15:45.695 --> 15:48.989
my entire opening paragraph

15:45.695 --> 15:48.989
is a palindrome.

15:49.031 --> 15:50.991
You might want to notice...

15:51.033 --> 15:52.952
my formatting.

15:57.749 --> 15:58.999
What's this?

15:59.041 --> 16:01.669
A study of irrigation techniques

15:59.041 --> 16:01.669
of pre-Roman society and how

16:01.711 --> 16:04.004
they led to the advancement

16:01.711 --> 16:04.004
of Western civilization.

16:04.046 --> 16:07.007
I thought we were just studying

16:04.046 --> 16:07.007
Mesopotamian farming techniques.

16:07.049 --> 16:08.008
We were.

16:08.050 --> 16:10.052
I just used that as

16:08.050 --> 16:10.052
a jumping-off point.

16:10.094 --> 16:12.722
I saw how their influences

16:10.094 --> 16:12.722
spread through the Egyptians,

16:12.764 --> 16:15.934
the Carthaginians, basically

16:12.764 --> 16:15.934
through the whole ancient world.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.018
I think you'll be very happy

16:15.975 --> 16:18.018
with this paper.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.605
Very nice, Number Twelve.

16:20.647 --> 16:24.233
It's nice to see

16:20.647 --> 16:24.233
a little effort put forth

16:24.275 --> 16:28.988
while some are content

16:24.275 --> 16:28.988
to do the absolute minimum.

16:30.740 --> 16:35.035
So... he wants... to play.

16:35.077 --> 16:37.622
Oh, we'll play all right.

16:37.664 --> 16:40.082
What is it we're playing?

16:40.124 --> 16:44.044
♪ ♪

17:11.113 --> 17:14.408
♪ ♪

17:43.062 --> 17:44.397
Okay, I think

17:43.062 --> 17:44.397
we're ready

17:44.438 --> 17:46.190
to show Principal

17:44.438 --> 17:46.190
Littledove

17:46.232 --> 17:49.402
what the right kind

17:46.232 --> 17:49.402
of motivation

17:46.232 --> 17:49.402
can accomplish.

17:49.443 --> 17:51.779
Well done, class.

17:56.242 --> 18:00.038
You know, maybe we should

17:56.242 --> 18:00.038
just put our heads down

18:00.079 --> 18:03.082
and take a rest

18:00.079 --> 18:03.082
for a moment, shall we?

18:07.211 --> 18:09.005
Yes, One-to-the-Eleventh?

18:09.047 --> 18:11.424
Did you know I can count

18:09.047 --> 18:11.424
to a million by prime numbers?

18:11.465 --> 18:12.926
I can, too!

18:12.967 --> 18:15.135
So can I! It's easy.

18:15.177 --> 18:16.429
That's not necessary.

18:16.470 --> 18:19.807
2, 3, 5, 7, 11...

18:19.849 --> 18:21.726
13, 17, 19...

18:21.768 --> 18:23.937
(frantically):

18:21.768 --> 18:23.937
23, 29, 31.

18:23.978 --> 18:25.730
Now by hundreds!

18:25.772 --> 18:31.235
101, 211, 307, 401, 503, 601...

18:31.277 --> 18:32.236
DABNEY:

18:31.277 --> 18:32.236
7!

18:32.278 --> 18:35.155
7! No!

18:35.197 --> 18:37.157
Okay, that is enough,

18:35.197 --> 18:37.157
One-to-the-Eleventh.

18:37.199 --> 18:39.159
By thousands! 1,009...

18:39.201 --> 18:40.160
2,003...

18:40.202 --> 18:41.161
Now back by hundreds!

18:41.203 --> 18:43.163
2,111, 2,203...

18:43.205 --> 18:44.248
2... 11...

18:44.290 --> 18:46.166
No!

18:46.208 --> 18:47.668
Where are you going,

18:46.208 --> 18:47.668
Number Three?

18:47.710 --> 18:48.878
It's hot.

18:48.920 --> 18:51.839
It's hot and I'm stupid!

18:51.881 --> 18:54.174
I'm stupid, too!

18:54.216 --> 18:55.175
(screaming)

18:55.217 --> 18:57.136
Everybody, please remain seated!

18:58.096 --> 18:59.680
I'm Zero!

19:00.848 --> 19:03.392
Zero-to-the-Zeroth!

19:03.434 --> 19:05.144
(screaming)

19:06.270 --> 19:08.940
(screaming)

19:15.237 --> 19:17.406
I'm nothing!

19:17.448 --> 19:20.367
I'm invisible!

19:20.409 --> 19:21.619
(whistles)

19:21.661 --> 19:24.288
Boy, that's quite a show

19:21.661 --> 19:24.288
for your first week here.

19:24.330 --> 19:27.667
You were right,

19:24.330 --> 19:27.667
you can't beat the system,

19:27.708 --> 19:29.961
but you sure can break it.

19:33.965 --> 19:35.591
I love you guys.

19:35.633 --> 19:38.218
I'll write you

19:35.633 --> 19:38.218
when I get there, okay?

19:38.260 --> 19:40.054
Someday, when

19:38.260 --> 19:40.054
you come back

19:40.096 --> 19:44.224
and you're unemployed

19:40.096 --> 19:44.224
and have no place to live,

19:44.266 --> 19:47.186
you can come stay at my castle.

19:48.980 --> 19:50.982
Thanks, bud.

19:51.983 --> 19:53.317
He's leaving.

19:53.359 --> 19:55.319
He just wants to talk to you.

19:55.361 --> 19:57.237
Just hear him out.

19:57.279 --> 20:00.282
Lois, this... this

19:57.279 --> 20:00.282
has got to stop.

20:00.324 --> 20:02.035
He's going very far away

20:02.076 --> 20:05.245
and you're not

20:02.076 --> 20:05.245
going to see him

20:02.076 --> 20:05.245
for a very long time.

20:06.789 --> 20:09.291
Honey, there are

20:06.789 --> 20:09.291
moments in life

20:09.333 --> 20:13.129
that you just

20:09.333 --> 20:13.129
don't get back,

20:09.333 --> 20:13.129
and I know you.

20:13.171 --> 20:15.255
If you do not deal

20:13.171 --> 20:15.255
with this now,

20:15.297 --> 20:17.800
it will haunt

20:15.297 --> 20:17.800
you  forever.

20:21.303 --> 20:22.346
Fine.

20:22.388 --> 20:27.226
I've lost a son

20:22.388 --> 20:27.226
but gained a baby.

20:30.021 --> 20:32.065
I tried.

20:32.106 --> 20:34.358
I know.

20:40.322 --> 20:42.533
Are you sure

20:40.322 --> 20:42.533
this is what you want?

20:42.575 --> 20:45.745
Well, it'd better be.

20:47.413 --> 20:49.040
LOIS:

20:47.413 --> 20:49.040
Francis.

20:59.967 --> 21:01.719
I'm listening.

21:04.222 --> 21:05.305
This is what you get!

21:05.347 --> 21:07.975
This is what you get for

21:05.347 --> 21:07.975
the way you treated me!

21:08.017 --> 21:11.353
I'm going to Alaska

21:08.017 --> 21:11.353
and you're going to

21:08.017 --> 21:11.353
be left without a son!

21:11.395 --> 21:13.313
And the horrible

21:11.395 --> 21:13.313
way you treated me

21:13.355 --> 21:14.815
is now a matter

21:13.355 --> 21:14.815
of public record!

21:14.857 --> 21:16.776
LOIS:

21:14.857 --> 21:16.776
I treated  you?!

21:16.817 --> 21:18.945
We've made sacrifice

21:16.817 --> 21:18.945
after sacrifice for you

21:18.986 --> 21:20.613
and you've caused us

21:18.986 --> 21:20.613
nothing but pain!

21:20.654 --> 21:22.322
You want pain?! I've

21:20.654 --> 21:22.322
got your scars, baby!

21:22.364 --> 21:24.200
3h years in that

21:22.364 --> 21:24.200
horrible school...

21:24.242 --> 21:26.035
We went without

21:24.242 --> 21:26.035
for that school!

21:26.077 --> 21:26.994
Oh!

21:27.036 --> 21:28.746
Oh! Maybe I should

21:27.036 --> 21:28.746
thank you!

21:28.788 --> 21:31.958
Thank you, Mother,

21:28.788 --> 21:31.958
for making my life

21:28.788 --> 21:31.958
a living hell!

21:31.999 --> 21:33.251
Living hell?!

21:31.999 --> 21:33.251
You've been nothing

21:33.292 --> 21:35.169
but a problem since

21:33.292 --> 21:35.169
the day you were born.

21:35.211 --> 21:37.213
Your problems are over, lady,

21:35.211 --> 21:37.213
'cause I'm out of here!
