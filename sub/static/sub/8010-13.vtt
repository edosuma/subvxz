00:03.306 --> 00:04.612
You are not an angel.

00:04.614 --> 00:06.547
And you will never do
anything to make me believe

00:06.549 --> 00:09.550
- that you are an angel.
- Look out! Bus!

00:09.552 --> 00:11.219
(horn blaring)

00:11.221 --> 00:12.653
(gasps)

00:13.456 --> 00:18.292
♪ Ah... ♪

00:18.294 --> 00:19.527
I'm sorry.

00:19.529 --> 00:21.028
Was there something you were saying

00:21.030 --> 00:22.697
before I so rudely pushed
you out of the way

00:22.699 --> 00:25.099
of a speeding bus, was hit by said bus

00:25.101 --> 00:26.534
and survived without a scratch?

00:26.536 --> 00:28.002
What was that?

00:28.004 --> 00:29.570
It was something about there's
nothing I could do

00:29.572 --> 00:33.441
that would ever make you believe that...

00:33.443 --> 00:35.810
You're an angel?

00:35.812 --> 00:37.078
That's it!

00:37.080 --> 00:38.613
She said it, finally.

00:38.615 --> 00:39.914
Halle-la-jah.

00:39.916 --> 00:41.249
You mean “hallelujah”?

00:41.251 --> 00:43.384
No, we pronounce it
differently up there.

00:43.386 --> 00:45.119
Well, she's of sound mind and body.

00:45.121 --> 00:46.287
Ha. Never thought I'd say that.

00:46.289 --> 00:47.588
Still, you should go to the hospital,

00:47.590 --> 00:48.923
have yourself checked out.

00:48.925 --> 00:50.224
No-no, she can't be fine.

00:50.226 --> 00:51.492
It-it's impossible.

00:51.494 --> 00:53.060
The bus was going way too fast.

00:53.062 --> 00:54.829
There's no way anyone could
walk away from that.

00:54.831 --> 00:57.298
She's always drunk. Chances
are she just went limp

00:57.300 --> 00:59.033
and ragdolled it under the bus.

00:59.035 --> 01:00.635
- Mm-mm.
- People survive

01:00.637 --> 01:02.370
crazy things all the time.

01:02.372 --> 01:05.173
It's about two-thirds of YouTube.

01:05.175 --> 01:06.707
Yeah, I can still do the snake.

01:06.709 --> 01:07.875
Yeah, send her back.

01:07.877 --> 01:09.210
I will not. Okay.

01:09.212 --> 01:11.145
But I'm very grateful what
you did to protect Allison.

01:11.147 --> 01:12.980
No, well, the only
thing I would ask in return

01:12.982 --> 01:14.782
is that I get to use you at
some point in the future

01:14.784 --> 01:16.517
as a character reference.

01:16.519 --> 01:18.352
Sure, just let me
know when the trial is.

01:18.354 --> 01:19.854
(laughs): Okay, oh, my
gosh, you're killing me.

01:19.856 --> 01:21.255
Um, I happily accept your offer,

01:21.257 --> 01:23.291
to be redeemed in the
future, in perpetuity,

01:23.293 --> 01:24.792
no blackout dates.

01:24.794 --> 01:27.128
Isn't every date a
blackout date for you?

01:27.130 --> 01:29.664
Marv, I cannot remember a
single time I blacked out.

01:29.666 --> 01:31.132
(chuckles)

01:31.134 --> 01:33.434
I still don't know how you survived that

01:33.436 --> 01:35.036
- without a scratch.
- I think you do.

01:35.038 --> 01:36.637
And maybe it would help you

01:36.639 --> 01:39.640
if you were to say it
one more time out loud.

01:39.642 --> 01:43.844
Okay, uh, I think...

01:43.846 --> 01:47.148
there's a possibility that...

01:47.150 --> 01:49.183
that you're an angel.

01:49.185 --> 01:51.953
Hello. We have a believer.

01:51.955 --> 01:53.421
Halle-la-jah.

01:59.997 --> 02:01.894
Amy you decided on
bringing Gavin to the wedding?

02:01.896 --> 02:03.829
I think it's too soon.
Might scare him off.

02:03.831 --> 02:06.031
Ooh, then you'll be free to
sit next to Hank's best man, Egyed.

02:06.033 --> 02:07.966
The Hungarian with the
sloppy five kiss hello?

02:07.968 --> 02:10.836
That guy's like a frog
trying to catch flies on my face.

02:10.838 --> 02:12.437
You'll get me back one day.

02:12.439 --> 02:14.606
I was thinking of bring
Amy as my plus one.

02:14.608 --> 02:17.009
Oh, my gosh! Yes! Yes!

02:17.011 --> 02:18.777
And you got me back.

02:19.680 --> 02:20.946
She's not going to wear
the vest, is she?

02:20.948 --> 02:22.547
I will now, cowbell.

02:22.549 --> 02:23.849
(whispers): She hears everything.

02:23.851 --> 02:26.084
(whispering): I do.

02:26.086 --> 02:28.820
So, two days out, how's the
mother of the bride doing?

02:28.822 --> 02:30.088
Good.

02:30.090 --> 02:32.724
I, um, did want to give you a heads up.

02:32.726 --> 02:34.226
I'm bringing a date.

02:34.228 --> 02:36.561
Oh, that's great. Who's the lucky guy?

02:36.563 --> 02:39.765
I think I might've mentioned
him, my ex-boyfriend Raphael.

02:39.767 --> 02:42.301
That's great. Yeah, and
I'm not just saying to you

02:42.303 --> 02:44.102
that I think it's great and
then running off and saying

02:44.104 --> 02:45.837
something different to
somebody else. I think it's great.

02:45.839 --> 02:47.773
- It's a disaster.
- Catastrophe.

02:47.775 --> 02:49.007
You can't show up alone now.

02:49.009 --> 02:50.242
No, that's why I'm
thinking about bringing Brandi.

02:50.244 --> 02:52.210
- You remember her?
- Flight attendant.

02:52.212 --> 02:54.046
Favorite movie is Love Actually,
I got her phone number then

02:54.048 --> 02:55.714
you slept with her the
night before Thanksgiving Brandi?

02:55.716 --> 02:57.215
Yeah, rings a bell.

02:57.217 --> 02:58.917
Okay, just, I don't want
it to be awkward for you.

02:58.919 --> 03:00.152
Why would it be awkward?

03:00.154 --> 03:01.720
It's great, Dad. And I'm not just saying

03:01.722 --> 03:03.322
it's great and then
gonna go run a four-mile sprint

03:03.324 --> 03:05.123
around the neighborhood to
work it out of my system.

03:05.125 --> 03:07.159
I mean it, it's great.

03:10.164 --> 03:12.497
Hi, Hank.

03:12.499 --> 03:14.499
Oh, Brad, listen, I have something
important to ask you.

03:14.501 --> 03:15.734
Anything, bro.

03:15.736 --> 03:16.935
It's your wedding weekend.

03:16.937 --> 03:19.137
My buddy, Lyle, he broke his
leg so he can't fly out

03:19.139 --> 03:20.839
and I know it's short notice,

03:20.841 --> 03:23.809
but do you think you
could fill in as a groomsman?

03:23.811 --> 03:25.043
I was thinking more along the lines

03:25.045 --> 03:27.045
of helping with these
boxes, but I could play the part

03:27.047 --> 03:28.613
of one of your closest male
friends in the world.

03:28.615 --> 03:30.549
Thank you. You just got to
walk people down the aisle,

03:30.551 --> 03:32.284
take a few pictures. No big deal.

03:32.286 --> 03:33.752
Great. Maybe that was Lyle's plan,

03:33.754 --> 03:35.153
but I'm a full service groomsman,

03:35.155 --> 03:36.855
with eight weddings under my cummerbund.

03:36.857 --> 03:38.890
I do it all from
sheepdogging the drunk uncles

03:38.892 --> 03:40.525
away from the bridesmaids

03:40.527 --> 03:42.828
to calming the nerves of
the groom on the big weekend.

03:42.830 --> 03:44.830
Don't need that. I'm only asking because

03:44.832 --> 03:47.366
Kelly wants even
numbers for the photographs.

03:47.368 --> 03:49.501
- You're nervous already.
- No, I'm not.

03:49.503 --> 03:50.736
Which is what nervous people say.

03:50.738 --> 03:52.437
It's also what people
say who are not nervous.

03:52.439 --> 03:54.006
Don't stress out, man.
You're in good hands.

03:54.008 --> 03:55.607
All right, now, how badly burned

03:55.609 --> 03:57.109
do you want to get in the wedding toast?

03:57.111 --> 03:59.845
We thinking like, “Oh,
Hank is so competitive at golf”

03:59.847 --> 04:01.646
or more like, “Oh,
Hank had a pregnancy scare

04:01.648 --> 04:03.181
with a Burmese prostitute”?

04:03.183 --> 04:05.751
Symmetrical photographs equal
numbers on both sides.

04:05.753 --> 04:07.619
That's it.

04:08.689 --> 04:10.789
You're gonna be fine, buddy.

04:10.791 --> 04:12.424
What should we do with
the rest of our day?

04:12.426 --> 04:13.692
Eh, here's an idea.

04:13.694 --> 04:16.194
- Now that you're a true believer...
- 51%.

04:16.196 --> 04:20.332
Let's play a little game
I like to call Angel Says.

04:20.334 --> 04:21.733
Angel says go talk to that guy.

04:21.735 --> 04:23.902
He seems lonely.

04:25.205 --> 04:26.271
All right.

04:26.273 --> 04:28.707
Hello.

04:28.709 --> 04:30.175
He owns tanning salons.

04:30.177 --> 04:32.210
He's going to give me a
bunch of referrals.

04:32.212 --> 04:35.047
I'm sorry, basal cell carcinomas
make me giddy.

04:35.049 --> 04:36.314
(chuckles)

04:36.316 --> 04:38.016
That guy's a jackpot.

04:38.018 --> 04:40.752
- Angel says stand up.
- Hmm?

04:40.754 --> 04:42.320
Thank you.

04:42.322 --> 04:43.688
- Oh, I get it.
- Mm.

04:43.690 --> 04:45.223
She needs a place to eat lunch.

04:45.225 --> 04:48.160
- Oh, it feels good to help people.
- Mm-hmm.

04:48.162 --> 04:49.227
(screams)

04:49.229 --> 04:50.929
- It feels bad to fall down.
- Oh.

04:50.931 --> 04:53.165
(laughs) Gosh, why is
it always so hilarious?

04:53.167 --> 04:54.433
Here, let me help.

04:54.435 --> 04:55.901
I got to say,

04:55.903 --> 04:57.803
believing is a lot
more fun than doubting.

04:57.805 --> 05:00.205
Oh, well, that is music

05:00.207 --> 05:02.240
- to all four of my ears.
- Huh?

05:02.242 --> 05:03.909
Our nips are wired for sound.

05:03.911 --> 05:06.812
And now that you know I've
yet to steer you wrong,

05:06.814 --> 05:10.115
do you agree to keep on following
all my angel commands?

05:10.117 --> 05:11.316
Sure.

05:11.318 --> 05:12.684
Fantastic.

05:12.686 --> 05:15.520
Angel says help me break
up Kelly and Hank's wedding.

05:15.522 --> 05:16.822
(gasps)

05:21.245 --> 05:23.912
You want me to break up
my best friend's wedding?

05:23.914 --> 05:25.247
Yes, I want you to break up

05:25.249 --> 05:26.915
your second best friend's wedding.

05:26.917 --> 05:28.117
Absolutely not.

05:28.119 --> 05:29.518
I can't do that to Kelly.

05:29.520 --> 05:31.387
Okay. Hey, you remember
that horrible feeling

05:31.389 --> 05:32.855
you've always had about Hank,

05:32.857 --> 05:35.290
that maybe he's
shady or hiding something?

05:35.292 --> 05:38.160
My angel sources have
just confirmed you're right.

05:38.162 --> 05:40.229
I knew it. What is he hiding?

05:40.231 --> 05:41.463
Oh, I wish I could
tell you but that intel

05:41.465 --> 05:43.465
is for high-level angels only.

05:43.467 --> 05:44.433
You don't know, do you?

05:44.435 --> 05:45.634
I'm a field angel.

05:45.636 --> 05:46.802
Of course I don't know.

05:46.804 --> 05:48.504
But I do know that
Kelly needs to be warned

05:48.506 --> 05:50.673
- before it's too late.
- Hang on.

05:50.675 --> 05:52.307
Why is Kelly
suddenly so important to you?

05:52.309 --> 05:53.609
You don't even like her.

05:53.611 --> 05:56.278
Shut your lying, wrong,
incorrect teeth mouth.

05:56.280 --> 05:58.180
I love that goat.

05:58.182 --> 06:00.082
No, you never do
anything unless it helps me.

06:00.084 --> 06:02.951
So this is about me somehow, isn't it?

06:02.953 --> 06:04.887
Allison, not everything is about you.

06:04.889 --> 06:07.056
Angels care about all people,

06:07.058 --> 06:08.924
even a known elder abuser like Kelly.

06:08.926 --> 06:10.626
I'm sorry, that's just
what people are saying.

06:10.628 --> 06:12.127
I love the girl.

06:12.129 --> 06:13.729
I tried to warn Kelly about Hank

06:13.731 --> 06:15.431
and it almost ruined our friendship.

06:15.433 --> 06:18.500
But if Hank is hiding something,
Kelly deserves to know.

06:18.502 --> 06:20.102
Look, I can't say
anything without proof.

06:20.104 --> 06:22.805
So we just dangle him
off the roof, Batman style,

06:22.807 --> 06:25.240
- until he squeals.
- Or...

06:25.242 --> 06:27.376
we feel things out with
his friends and family

06:27.378 --> 06:29.411
at the rehearsal dinner.

06:29.413 --> 06:31.046
Angel says your plan blows.

06:31.048 --> 06:33.048
- Huh?
- What?

06:33.050 --> 06:35.484
I tried to get some dirt
on Hank from his relatives,

06:35.486 --> 06:37.286
- and guess what.
- What?

06:37.288 --> 06:39.154
There aren't any here.

06:39.156 --> 06:41.323
- And you know what that means.
- Wh...?

06:41.325 --> 06:43.192
(quietly): He ate them all.

06:43.194 --> 06:44.927
That last was speculation.

06:44.929 --> 06:46.662
(quietly): Or is it?

06:46.664 --> 06:47.963
- KELLY: Allison.
- Hmm?

06:47.965 --> 06:50.132
- You look so beautiful.
- So do you.

06:50.134 --> 06:52.101
Amy.

06:52.103 --> 06:55.671
What an incredible...
dedication to vests.

06:55.673 --> 06:57.639
Thanks, kid. Hey,
this party kicks more ass

06:57.641 --> 06:59.208
than you at a nursing home.

07:00.778 --> 07:02.144
What? It's an expression.

07:02.146 --> 07:04.446
So, where is Hank's family?

07:04.448 --> 07:05.581
I want to say hi.

07:05.583 --> 07:07.049
Hank doesn't have a
lot of really close friends

07:07.051 --> 07:09.651
and both of his parents passed away.

07:09.653 --> 07:11.053
Hey, can I ask how they died

07:11.055 --> 07:13.622
and provide an alternate theory?

07:13.624 --> 07:16.925
Hey, is that Hank talking
Hungarian with Egyed?

07:16.927 --> 07:18.660
Yeah. He's fluent.

07:18.662 --> 07:20.896
I just found this out recently.

07:20.898 --> 07:22.331
Hank is full of surprises.

07:22.333 --> 07:24.666
Or relatives.

07:24.668 --> 07:27.136
- (speaking Hungarian)
- Ah, and so it begins,

07:27.138 --> 07:29.037
my friend, the big
day before the big day.

07:29.039 --> 07:31.440
Brad, this is Egyed. Egyed, Brad.

07:31.442 --> 07:33.842
- Oh, hey.
- Oh. Oh, and great.

07:33.844 --> 07:35.344
Three, four, five.

07:35.346 --> 07:38.147
I was going to go in for
six, but all right.

07:38.149 --> 07:39.414
Nice to meet you.

07:39.416 --> 07:40.916
So, uh, how do you guys know each other?

07:40.918 --> 07:43.786
We met at, uh, how do you say... prison.

07:43.788 --> 07:44.820
- No.
- No. Starbucks.

07:44.822 --> 07:46.522
- Yes.
- (laughing)

07:46.524 --> 07:48.557
All right, cool crew. Loving the vibe.

07:48.559 --> 07:50.959
Kind of bummed I
missed the bachelor party now.

07:50.961 --> 07:52.094
Oh, you didn't miss a thing.

07:52.096 --> 07:53.328
We didn't bother having one.

07:53.330 --> 07:54.663
You didn't get a buck's night?

07:54.665 --> 07:57.166
Oh, no. That's... You
know what? Hold on.

07:57.168 --> 07:59.001
Oh, yeah, yeah.

07:59.003 --> 08:00.836
Yep, I got it. Party's tonight.

08:00.838 --> 08:03.505
Five hundy each, wear
your funniest hat...

08:03.507 --> 08:04.773
Thanks, but, uh, I'd
rather just hit the sauna.

08:04.775 --> 08:06.375
You know, go to bed early

08:06.377 --> 08:07.410
so I'm nice and relaxed for

08:07.435 --> 08:08.443
- tomorrow morning.
- Got it.

08:08.445 --> 08:09.878
You got cold feet. Want to warm 'em up.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.380
I'm in. Egyed, you in?

08:11.382 --> 08:13.282
Eh...

08:13.284 --> 08:14.716
(continues): Eh...

08:14.718 --> 08:16.885
Is it... Does he not
know the word for yes?

08:16.887 --> 08:18.787
No, no, just thought idea was, um,

08:18.789 --> 08:21.857
eh...

08:21.859 --> 08:23.292
- Marv.
- Hey.

08:23.294 --> 08:25.961
Hi. I wanted to
introduce you to Raphael.

08:25.963 --> 08:27.496
The fireman.

08:27.498 --> 08:28.530
What a pleasure.

08:28.532 --> 08:30.199
- You're from Brazil, right?
- That's right.

08:30.201 --> 08:32.467
Great country. Giant Jesuses,

08:32.469 --> 08:33.735
tiny bananas.

08:33.736 --> 08:35.871
Stunning contrast.

08:35.873 --> 08:37.339
RAPHAEL: Marv, watch your shoes.

08:38.075 --> 08:40.208
Careful there.

08:40.211 --> 08:44.279
Well, tough coming back from that.

08:45.049 --> 08:46.215
Oh, excuse me.

08:46.217 --> 08:47.449
Don't move.

08:47.451 --> 08:48.684
Brandi.

08:48.686 --> 08:49.751
BRANDI: Hi.

08:49.753 --> 08:51.320
Hey, I couldn't find the restrooms.

08:51.322 --> 08:52.888
Do you know where they are?

08:52.890 --> 08:54.089
Hey, you're going to have to hold that.

08:54.091 --> 08:55.257
- Come with me.
- Uh...

08:55.259 --> 08:57.860
Oh, come on.

08:57.862 --> 08:59.194
- Oh, there they are.
- Marv,

08:59.196 --> 09:00.696
am I here just as arm candy

09:00.698 --> 09:02.497
to make an ex of yours jealous?

09:02.499 --> 09:03.732
What?

09:03.734 --> 09:07.002
I'm sorry, I know it's petty.

09:07.004 --> 09:08.537
That magnificent Latin American

09:08.539 --> 09:11.240
just lifted me up out of a puddle.

09:11.242 --> 09:12.808
Mm, tough to come back from that.

09:12.810 --> 09:14.910
- Right?
- But we can try.

09:14.912 --> 09:16.945
- Yes.
- Think this will work?

09:16.947 --> 09:18.280
I'm sorry, I just blacked out a little.

09:18.282 --> 09:20.449
Come again?

09:21.652 --> 09:23.185
All right, me and my
boys are hitting the sauna.

09:23.187 --> 09:24.519
Hey, do me a favor.

09:24.521 --> 09:25.888
See what you can find out about Hank.

09:25.890 --> 09:27.956
I feel like he's
hiding something from Kelly.

09:27.958 --> 09:29.258
Mm-hmm. No can do. I'm a groomsman.

09:29.260 --> 09:31.026
You want a rat in this wedding party,

09:31.028 --> 09:33.161
hit up the ring bearer.

09:33.163 --> 09:35.063
That little dude will do
anything for a gumball.

09:36.300 --> 09:37.532
All right, let's go, boys.

09:37.534 --> 09:39.368
Uh-uh, not you.

09:39.370 --> 09:41.503
I mean, it is fishy, right?

09:41.505 --> 09:43.005
I mean, Hank has no family here,

09:43.007 --> 09:44.573
he tells zero personal stories.

09:44.575 --> 09:46.909
We need proof and we're
running out of time.

09:46.911 --> 09:48.644
Okay, hold on. I will be right back.

09:48.646 --> 09:51.413
(pants) Hey, I'm back.

09:51.415 --> 09:53.548
- What?
- Yeah, I paused time

09:53.550 --> 09:55.550
and I stole a key to Hank's hotel
room from the front desk.

09:55.552 --> 09:57.386
Really? You didn't
get that from the maid

09:57.388 --> 09:58.754
you were chatting up earlier?

09:58.756 --> 10:01.089
Uh, no, that is where I got this weed.

10:01.091 --> 10:03.225
Keep moving, snitch.

10:04.261 --> 10:05.627
Okay, listen, this is what we got to do.

10:05.629 --> 10:07.229
We got to break into Hank's hotel room

10:07.231 --> 10:09.364
while he's out with
Brad, maybe smoke this weed,

10:09.366 --> 10:11.566
and figure out what he's hiding.

10:11.568 --> 10:12.968
Okay, this is
getting a little too crazy.

10:12.970 --> 10:15.270
Stopping time, breaking and entering,

10:15.272 --> 10:17.472
stealing drugs from service workers.

10:17.474 --> 10:19.141
- You need to come with me. Come on.
- What?

10:19.143 --> 10:20.509
We can speak freely in here.

10:20.511 --> 10:23.679
Corporate can't hear over water.

10:23.681 --> 10:25.280
What is going on?

10:25.282 --> 10:26.515
I need to break up this wedding because

10:26.517 --> 10:27.783
your future depends on it.

10:27.785 --> 10:29.518
I knew it was about me!

10:29.520 --> 10:30.953
Of course it's about you.

10:30.955 --> 10:33.021
- (water stops)
- It's always about you. Shoot.

10:33.023 --> 10:35.924
Listen, I'm not supposed
to tell you any of this,

10:35.926 --> 10:38.593
but this entire year, every single thing

10:38.595 --> 10:41.830
that I have been teaching
you has been training.

10:41.832 --> 10:43.665
For the Olympics.

10:43.667 --> 10:44.866
The Olympics?

10:44.868 --> 10:47.736
- Summer? Winter? Beer?
- No.

10:47.738 --> 10:50.205
The Angel Olympics. And
just for the record,

10:50.207 --> 10:53.542
we thought of that name way before
the Greeks did in 2004.

10:53.544 --> 10:55.110
The first Olympics was
thousands of years ago.

10:55.112 --> 10:57.045
Okay. Then we totally
stole it from them.

10:57.047 --> 10:58.413
Each human has one year in their life

10:58.415 --> 10:59.982
that becomes their critical year.

10:59.984 --> 11:02.918
And how they face the
challenges at that crossroads

11:02.920 --> 11:05.354
determines their whole future.

11:05.356 --> 11:07.289
And, honey, next year

11:07.291 --> 11:10.692
is your Angel Olympics.

11:10.694 --> 11:12.294
Shoot!

11:12.296 --> 11:14.830
So, so, this last year, uh,

11:14.832 --> 11:17.466
when I got in a fight
with a baby, was punk'd

11:17.468 --> 11:19.801
by an improv group, and I
killed my brother's guardian angel,

11:19.803 --> 11:21.803
this wasn't my most critical year?

11:21.805 --> 11:24.373
It's nothing compared
to what's coming up.

11:24.375 --> 11:27.042
Honey, if you crush your Angel Olympics,

11:27.044 --> 11:31.213
the rest of your life will be
nothing less than spectacular.

11:31.215 --> 11:35.584
Oh, I'm talking professional
awards, a kick-ass family life,

11:35.586 --> 11:38.520
and, best of all, picture
yourself onstage

11:38.522 --> 11:40.555
with one of those
headset microphones, a smug look

11:40.557 --> 11:43.792
on your face, gazing
out over a packed house,

11:43.794 --> 11:47.696
- as you prepare to give your TED Talk.
- TED talk?

11:47.698 --> 11:49.564
(gasps) O...

11:49.566 --> 11:51.700
What happens if my Olympics go poorly?

11:51.702 --> 11:54.503
Well, let's just say 14
cats and you're not the alpha.

11:54.505 --> 11:56.705
- Oh, I hate cats.
- Oh, it's mutual.

11:56.707 --> 11:59.408
So how does breaking up
Kelly and Hank's wedding

11:59.410 --> 12:01.676
play into all of this?

12:01.678 --> 12:05.213
Kelly is destined to be
integral in your life this year.

12:05.215 --> 12:08.283
She's already my best friend.
How could she be more integral?

12:08.285 --> 12:11.386
Listen, I'm a field angel. They
don't trust me with those details.

12:11.388 --> 12:14.056
All I know is if Kelly marries Hank,

12:14.058 --> 12:16.758
she won't be there for
you when you need her most,

12:16.760 --> 12:20.095
and that could be devastating
for you. So,

12:20.097 --> 12:24.132
do you believe or not?

12:24.134 --> 12:25.967
I do.

12:25.969 --> 12:27.669
I believe.

12:27.671 --> 12:29.604
So let's break into
Hank's room and find out

12:29.606 --> 12:31.573
- what he's hiding from Kelly.
- Yes!

12:32.810 --> 12:34.576
Three amigos ridin' the cedar.

12:34.578 --> 12:37.012
End of an era, huh? We're
droppin' like flies

12:37.014 --> 12:38.547
out there, guys. (chuckles)

12:38.549 --> 12:40.315
You are married, right, Egyed?

12:40.317 --> 12:42.551
Back home, yes. Here, free.

12:42.553 --> 12:45.587
- Like farkas.
- (chuckles) What's, uh...

12:45.589 --> 12:47.055
- Wolf. Yeah.
- Ah.

12:47.057 --> 12:48.723
Speaking of, uh, lone farkas-es,

12:48.725 --> 12:50.592
what's up with that dude?

12:50.594 --> 12:52.294
HANK: I don't know. He's been
like that since we got here.

12:52.296 --> 12:53.995
Kind of worried about
him. He hasn't moved.

12:53.997 --> 12:57.566
- Are you worried about him?
- No, not really.

12:57.568 --> 12:59.167
I just feel like maybe
we should check on him.

12:59.169 --> 13:00.669
- All right, I'll take a peek.
- Just check.

13:00.671 --> 13:03.572
(clears throat) Excuse me, sir?

13:03.574 --> 13:05.407
- Peek under the face towel.
- Yeah?

13:05.409 --> 13:07.876
- (laughing): Oh!
- (Tag Team's “Whoomp!” playing)

13:07.878 --> 13:11.580
Surprise sauna bachelor party!

13:11.582 --> 13:13.782
Oh, my Isten!

13:13.784 --> 13:15.417
- Incoming.
- Ah.

13:15.419 --> 13:17.385
Oh. These are hot to the touch.

13:17.387 --> 13:20.989
Yeah, I thought you'd get
to Beer Man sooner.

13:20.991 --> 13:23.758
Kelly says that you went
to UCLA. Me, too.

13:23.760 --> 13:25.594
Warm brewskis kind of reminds
you of a Bruins tailgate, huh?

13:25.596 --> 13:27.829
- Oh, yeah.
- What year were you?

13:27.831 --> 13:29.431
Uh, '99.

13:29.433 --> 13:32.200
2000. Oh, man, you
remember Tom McNichols? Mmm.

13:32.202 --> 13:35.270
Tom. Mm, no, I don't remember that guy.

13:35.272 --> 13:38.840
No, that was the burger
joint everybody went to.

13:38.842 --> 13:41.276
Right. Yeah, Tom McNich... Of course.

13:41.278 --> 13:43.311
Yeah, yeah. I wasn't a big burger guy.

13:43.313 --> 13:45.313
No? Well, then, uh,
you might not want to check

13:45.315 --> 13:46.515
under that guy's towels.

13:46.517 --> 13:48.717
♪ Whoomp, there it is ♪

13:48.719 --> 13:52.154
Oh, my Isten!

13:54.124 --> 13:56.491
Why didn't you and Linda work out?

13:56.493 --> 13:58.126
Turns out we had nothing in common.

13:58.128 --> 14:00.762
Not true. You were both picked
up by hot Brazilian men.

14:00.764 --> 14:04.332
(chuckles) You're throwing
a lot of shade for arm candy.

14:04.334 --> 14:06.902
Oh. Oh, um, two MacManuses, please.

14:06.904 --> 14:08.970
Oh. A woman who knows
her scotch. If you love

14:08.972 --> 14:11.339
the New York Mets, I'd ask
you to marry me right now.

14:11.341 --> 14:14.276
Oh, my God. I love the Mets.
Yes, let's get married!

14:14.278 --> 14:16.329
I can't believe this
is finally happening!

14:16.354 --> 14:17.379
No, no, I was just...

14:17.381 --> 14:19.314
I'm just kidding. I don't
know anything about sports,

14:19.316 --> 14:20.682
and I don't want to get married.

14:20.684 --> 14:22.817
I'm gonna need a minute.

14:22.819 --> 14:25.153
Wow, wow.

14:26.523 --> 14:28.523
We have been here for two seconds,

14:28.525 --> 14:30.158
and you already have your
giant Toblerone fingerprints

14:30.160 --> 14:31.159
all over this dresser.

14:31.161 --> 14:32.561
Oh. I'll wipe it off.

14:32.563 --> 14:34.262
- With these pants.
- Just stay focused

14:34.264 --> 14:35.697
and help me find something useful.

14:35.699 --> 14:37.465
Like his wallet?

14:37.467 --> 14:39.134
Let's see if there's
any smoking guns in here.

14:39.136 --> 14:41.870
Hmm. (gasps)

14:41.872 --> 14:42.971
What is it?

14:42.973 --> 14:44.639
- Oh, that's how I sneeze.
- Oh.

14:44.641 --> 14:46.241
- (gasps)
- Bless you.

14:46.243 --> 14:48.476
No, that was a gasp. I found something.

14:48.478 --> 14:50.979
Thanks to my years of making
fake IDs for kids

14:50.981 --> 14:52.914
who want to buy beer and
adults who want to play

14:52.916 --> 14:56.785
in the Little League
World Series, I know a fake ID

14:56.787 --> 14:58.320
when I see one.

14:58.322 --> 15:01.223
- How can you tell?
- Allison, every single thing

15:01.225 --> 15:02.857
is upside down.

15:02.859 --> 15:04.392
(sighs)

15:05.865 --> 15:08.096
Oh. Must have smoked a
little too much of the maid's weed.

15:08.098 --> 15:09.264
(chuckles)

15:09.266 --> 15:10.281
- (door opens)
- Oh.

15:11.168 --> 15:13.735
(panting quietly)

15:18.942 --> 15:20.675
(quietly): Do not eat those chips.

15:20.677 --> 15:22.010
I'm not gonna eat them.

15:22.012 --> 15:24.813
I'm just opening them.

15:24.815 --> 15:27.282
Shh. Do not eat those chips.

15:27.284 --> 15:30.552
I'm just going to eat
one to test its crunchiness.

15:30.554 --> 15:32.387
And if it's not that bad,

15:32.389 --> 15:34.623
I'm going to have the rest.

15:34.625 --> 15:37.092
- (crunching)
- (groans)

15:37.094 --> 15:40.562
It's really loud in my head.

15:40.564 --> 15:43.365
- How does it sound to you?
- Stop it.

15:43.367 --> 15:45.667
- HANK: Oh, what happened to my pants?
- Oh, crap.

15:45.669 --> 15:47.035
Crap. What are we gonna do?

15:47.037 --> 15:48.970
We make ourselves really big.

15:48.972 --> 15:50.972
- That'll scare him off.
- That's for bears.

15:50.974 --> 15:53.275
Uh, we'll make him drink a
glass of water really fast.

15:53.277 --> 15:54.153
That's for hiccups.

15:54.178 --> 15:56.344
Okay. I got it. Plan C.
I'm gonna angel kiss him

15:56.346 --> 15:58.179
and then make him tell us the truth.

15:58.181 --> 16:00.448
I just have to make
sure I dock my tongue solidly

16:00.450 --> 16:01.583
on his brain stem.

16:01.585 --> 16:04.786
Don't eat those chips.

16:07.357 --> 16:08.957
- What are you doing here?
- Is this

16:08.959 --> 16:11.760
not my hotel room? Well,

16:11.762 --> 16:13.628
butter my jam.

16:13.630 --> 16:15.030
- (gasping)
- Amy!

16:15.032 --> 16:15.897
(grunts)

16:15.899 --> 16:16.731
Kiss me.

16:16.733 --> 16:18.199
- Get her off me!
- Okay!

16:19.836 --> 16:22.037
Amy. Allison! What is going on here?!

16:22.039 --> 16:24.072
I don't even know.

16:24.074 --> 16:26.308
Allison, what are you doing in
here the night before our wedding?

16:26.310 --> 16:28.243
I think the question is,
what are you doing in Hank's room

16:28.245 --> 16:31.146
the night before the wedding?
I mean, scandalous.

16:36.770 --> 16:38.725
Okay, what are you doing in Hank's room?

16:38.727 --> 16:39.827
- Kelly, I can explain.
- Well, you better,

16:39.829 --> 16:41.228
because I'm about to lose it.

16:41.230 --> 16:44.298
- Uh, is everything okay?
- Okay, Kelly, look,

16:44.300 --> 16:47.668
Amy found Hank's license,
and we're just worried...

16:47.670 --> 16:50.437
Yeah, no, this isn't about Hank.
This is about Amy. I mean,

16:50.439 --> 16:53.106
I don't know what weird
power she has over you, but...

16:53.108 --> 16:54.842
Mark, can you please explain to
your daughter that this woman

16:54.844 --> 16:56.410
- is bad news?
- Yeah, Mark,

16:56.412 --> 16:58.512
what kind of a character reference
would you give me?

16:58.514 --> 17:01.415
Well, I know on the
outside it's hard to believe

17:01.417 --> 17:03.917
that these two would be
friends, but the fact of the matter is

17:03.919 --> 17:05.886
Allison's had a very difficult year,

17:05.887 --> 17:07.721
and Amy was there for her.

17:07.723 --> 17:09.356
For our whole family.

17:09.358 --> 17:11.657
I, uh, have an announcement.

17:11.660 --> 17:13.292
What is your entire
family doing in this room?

17:13.295 --> 17:16.630
Sorry, bro. I have to
turn in my boutonniere.

17:17.733 --> 17:19.098
This man is not who he claims to be.

17:19.101 --> 17:21.234
(gasps) Wow.

17:21.237 --> 17:23.470
- No one says “God bless you” anymore?
- I thought something was amiss

17:23.472 --> 17:25.705
when Hank didn't recognize the
most popular burger joint

17:25.708 --> 17:28.040
at UCLA. So I did some diggin',

17:28.042 --> 17:30.010
and I called a girl
that I used to date, Stacy.

17:30.012 --> 17:32.446
Class of '99. She was a
senior, I was just a junior.

17:32.448 --> 17:34.548
Older girls always liked me. Whatevs.

17:34.550 --> 17:36.049
And I asked Stacy, “Had you ever heard

17:36.051 --> 17:38.252
- of a Hank Peale?”
- Aren't there, like,

17:38.254 --> 17:40.888
30,000 undergrad students at UCLA?

17:40.890 --> 17:43.724
Thanks, story ruiner. So
Stacy says, “Aren't there, like,

17:43.726 --> 17:45.792
30,000 undergrads at UCLA”"

17:45.794 --> 17:47.628
And I went online and I checked.

17:47.630 --> 17:49.630
And, sure enough, looking
up “Hank Peal”"

17:49.632 --> 17:53.634
and “Henry Peale,”
neither went to UCLA in the 1990s.

17:53.636 --> 17:55.795
This man is not who he claims to
be, and I dated a senior.

17:55.798 --> 17:58.906
- And... he has a fake ID.
- That's your weed.

17:58.908 --> 18:00.841
HANK: Fine!

18:01.844 --> 18:03.610
(sighs)

18:03.612 --> 18:05.345
I'm 51.

18:05.347 --> 18:07.080
(gasping) What?

18:07.082 --> 18:09.583
I'm not 38. I'm 51.

18:09.585 --> 18:11.418
And I'm sorry, all right?

18:11.420 --> 18:14.321
I lied on our first date, and
it just snowballed from there.

18:14.323 --> 18:16.490
I mean, you know how
these things happen.

18:16.492 --> 18:18.458
No, I don't.

18:18.460 --> 18:20.527
He looks fantastic.

18:20.529 --> 18:23.063
- So the ID was fake.
- Yeah. Wait, okay,

18:23.065 --> 18:25.065
so if you lied about this,
what else did you lie about?

18:25.067 --> 18:26.099
Nothin'.

18:26.101 --> 18:27.868
Except I did take

18:27.870 --> 18:29.536
that finance job in Budapest.

18:29.538 --> 18:31.538
- And I'm originally from Canada.
- What?

18:31.540 --> 18:33.540
We were gonna move to
Hungary? And you're Canadian?

18:33.542 --> 18:34.908
I knew that's why he hated burgers.

18:34.910 --> 18:37.077
- We have a lot to talk “aboot.”
- (groans)

18:37.079 --> 18:40.714
See, Allison? She would not
have been there for you next year.

18:40.716 --> 18:42.783
You know what, let's get out of here,

18:42.785 --> 18:44.818
let Kelly and Hank talk this out.

18:44.820 --> 18:45.752
Here's your fake ID,

18:45.754 --> 18:48.455
- hoser.
- Thank you.

18:48.457 --> 18:52.359
Good morning, everybody. So... Oh.

18:52.361 --> 18:54.261
The Joker grin is
back. I take it you had

18:54.263 --> 18:55.562
another good night with Brandi?

18:55.564 --> 18:58.231
Oh, yeah. I'm a little concerned though.

18:58.233 --> 19:00.634
I have to give some bad news
to a patient, and I'm worried

19:00.636 --> 19:03.136
this won't be gone by
then. “I'm sorry, Bernie.

19:03.138 --> 19:05.072
- It's inoperable.”
- I'd call him.

19:05.074 --> 19:07.107
- ALLISON, AMY AND BRAD: Yeah.
- I should do it over the phone.

19:07.109 --> 19:07.892
So, how's Kelly?

19:07.917 --> 19:10.010
About the same as anyone
who just called off

19:10.012 --> 19:12.346
their wedding, massively hungover.

19:12.348 --> 19:14.114
She is sleeping it off in my room.

19:14.116 --> 19:15.849
And for the record, that
penis was drawn on her shoulder

19:15.851 --> 19:17.351
before I got here.

19:17.353 --> 19:19.653
Well, I think this
is for the best anyway,

19:19.655 --> 19:21.355
because she's way too good for Hank.

19:21.357 --> 19:23.690
She's a special girl. She
deserves a special guy.

19:23.692 --> 19:27.060
Thanks, Brad. That's really sweet.

19:27.062 --> 19:29.830
You know what you
need? My hangover cure.

19:29.832 --> 19:32.666
I'm gonna whip you up some
eggs and make you an Irish coffee.

19:32.668 --> 19:34.468
- My hero.
- (chuckles)

19:34.470 --> 19:37.504
Mmm. Yes. (chuckles)

19:37.506 --> 19:41.742
Look at those two, getting
integral together.

19:41.744 --> 19:43.677
Oh, my God, do they end up together?

19:43.679 --> 19:46.279
Hey, I wish I could tell you, but
you just don't have the clearance.

19:46.281 --> 19:48.115
- You don't know, do you?
- They tell me so little.

19:48.117 --> 19:49.649
I want to show you something. Come here.

19:49.651 --> 19:52.886
It's a, uh... a
little congratulations gift.

19:52.888 --> 19:55.222
Because, uh, believing is a huge step,

19:55.224 --> 19:56.623
and it should be celebrated.

19:56.625 --> 19:59.259
- Aw, you shouldn't have.
- Eh.

19:59.261 --> 20:02.696
(gasps) Oh, my God.

20:02.698 --> 20:04.731
- Try it on.
- This is gonna be so great

20:04.733 --> 20:07.300
- for my TED Talk. Mmm.
- TED Talk.

20:07.302 --> 20:10.704
Thank you. For this and...

20:10.706 --> 20:13.740
for everything you've done for
me over the last few months.

20:13.742 --> 20:15.575
You've been a real...

20:15.577 --> 20:18.245
angel. You're incredible,

20:18.247 --> 20:20.213
Dr. Allison Fuller,

20:20.215 --> 20:23.683
and you are gonna have
an amazing Olympic year.

20:23.685 --> 20:26.319
(doorbell rings)

20:27.856 --> 20:29.823
Hi.

20:29.825 --> 20:33.660
My name is Steven Williams.
I'm looking for Amy Cass.

20:33.662 --> 20:36.263
I-I saw her name in a police
bulletin about a bus accident,

20:36.265 --> 20:38.131
and they gave me this address.

20:38.133 --> 20:39.633
Do you know Amy?

20:39.635 --> 20:40.934
Yeah.

20:40.936 --> 20:42.801
I'm her husband.

20:42.838 --> 20:45.346
Hey, Steve.

20:46.942 --> 20:48.842
Things are about to get weird.

20:55.842 --> 21:01.004
