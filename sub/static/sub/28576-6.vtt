00:05.880 --> 00:08.880
-[Harrow] Previously...
-[Nichols] He drowned.

00:08.920 --> 00:11.720
He boarded a ferry last night.He never got off.

00:11.760 --> 00:14.320
[Harrow]
Simon turns up at the bar,

00:14.360 --> 00:18.080
asks for Moran, and within
90 minutes, they're both dead.

00:18.120 --> 00:19.320
[Grace] I stand by my autopsy,

00:19.360 --> 00:21.200
and I'm not
reopening Simon's body

00:21.240 --> 00:22.760
on some crazy hunch.

00:22.800 --> 00:25.000
[Harrow]
I know what Simon found.

00:25.040 --> 00:27.400
A link between Brendan Skeane
and Francis Chester.

00:27.440 --> 00:29.720
They shared a cell together.

00:29.760 --> 00:31.760
The handwriting is identical.

00:31.800 --> 00:34.120
I'm convinced
he killed Simon and Moran.

00:34.160 --> 00:36.680
[Pavich] Simon diedbecause he was burningthe candle at both ends.

00:36.720 --> 00:39.880
-Why?
-Because he was
trying to be like you!

00:39.920 --> 00:42.640
[Harrow] Simon's dead,
and I think it's my fault.

00:42.680 --> 00:44.480
There is no conspiracy.

00:44.520 --> 00:47.200
No more chasing ghosts.

Do you know what time it is?

02:51.160 --> 02:54.640
Yes. Pack a bag.
I'm sending you west.

02:54.680 --> 02:55.920
[Harrow] Where?

02:55.960 --> 02:57.720
-Euralla Creek.
-Where?

02:57.760 --> 02:59.920
It's 100 miles
south of Cunnamulla.

02:59.960 --> 03:01.480
Google it.

03:01.520 --> 03:03.480
There's only one flight
in and out every day,

03:03.520 --> 03:05.640
-hence the early wake-up call.
-[elevator dings]

03:05.680 --> 03:08.200
Can't someone else go? I've gota stack of PMs to do here.

03:08.240 --> 03:09.920
Well, Grace and Iwill take care of that.

03:09.960 --> 03:12.120
You know how I feel about
the outback.

03:12.160 --> 03:15.480
It'll do you good to get awayfor a couple of days.

03:15.520 --> 03:17.800
Now, don't worry,you're not going alone.

[Fairley sighs]

03:26.400 --> 03:28.440
It's a beautiful country,
isn't it?

03:28.480 --> 03:34.080
Yes, if you're partial to dust,flies, and dueling banjos.

03:34.120 --> 03:39.200
I suggest you choose
your clever remarks
more carefully around here.

03:39.240 --> 03:42.080
Or what?I'll be lynched by the locals?

03:42.120 --> 03:43.560
Fingers crossed.

03:45.160 --> 03:46.560
I still don't getwhy Maxine

03:46.600 --> 03:49.800
had to send twopathologists to an MVA.

03:49.840 --> 03:51.360
I'm sure she had
her reasons.

03:51.400 --> 03:53.080
[sighs]

03:53.120 --> 03:56.440
Wasn't the local sergeant
going to pick us up?

03:56.480 --> 03:59.280
Maxine said he'd be here.

04:00.440 --> 04:01.800
I'll give him a call.

04:05.880 --> 04:07.080
[cell phone beeps]

04:07.120 --> 04:09.640
[sighs] Great. No signal.

04:09.680 --> 04:12.640
So, how do we get to town?

04:12.680 --> 04:14.520
Coming or not?

04:32.800 --> 04:34.040
Cute.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.040
Lyle Fairley?

04:41.080 --> 04:43.400
Judy. Don.

04:43.440 --> 04:45.720
I thought it was you!
Welcome home.

04:45.760 --> 04:46.920
It's been too long.

04:46.960 --> 04:48.320
Yes.

04:48.360 --> 04:49.760
[chuckles]

04:49.800 --> 04:51.560
Fancy seeing him!

04:52.640 --> 04:53.880
You're from here?

04:53.920 --> 04:55.680
I grew up here.

04:56.760 --> 04:58.480
Well, why didn't you say so?

04:58.520 --> 05:00.240
You didn't ask.

05:04.560 --> 05:06.800
They love you.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.680
What's wrong with them?

05:12.680 --> 05:14.920
[indistinct chatter]

05:24.840 --> 05:28.160
-Hello, doctor.
-Hello sergeant.

05:30.520 --> 05:32.560
That's all you gotfor your little brother?

05:32.600 --> 05:35.400
Come here!
Come on, bring it in!

05:35.440 --> 05:37.040
Bring it in!

05:37.080 --> 05:39.040
You're his brother?

05:39.080 --> 05:41.640
Senior Sergeant Colin Fairley.
You must be Dr. Harrow.

05:41.680 --> 05:43.480
Lyle's told me all about you.

05:43.520 --> 05:46.920
-Don't believe a word of it.
-He said you'd say that.

05:46.960 --> 05:48.640
So, how's our niece settling in?

05:48.680 --> 05:50.960
Well, it's early days,
but she's doing well.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.240
-She's doing amazingly.
-I'm not surprised, being
in such good hands.

05:54.280 --> 05:55.480
Mostly.

05:57.160 --> 05:59.360
And Maxine said therewas a death on the team?

06:00.440 --> 06:01.960
Yes.

06:03.040 --> 06:04.720
Shall we take a look?

06:06.160 --> 06:09.240
Before we do, there'ssomething you should know.

06:09.280 --> 06:11.920
Bob and Diane?

06:11.960 --> 06:14.240
It's tragic.

06:14.280 --> 06:15.480
You knew them?

06:15.520 --> 06:17.560
Everyone knew them.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.920
They ran the local bakery.

06:19.960 --> 06:22.480
We think they were heading in
to work when their vehicle
was struck.

06:22.520 --> 06:25.880
Diane was killed on impact
but we found Bob on the road,
unconscious.

06:25.920 --> 06:27.920
He was thrown
from the vehicle.

06:27.960 --> 06:30.800
-No airbags?
-They weren't even
wearing seat belts.

06:30.840 --> 06:33.760
-Is that unusual out here?
-It is for Bob and Diane.

06:33.800 --> 06:35.000
Will Bob pull through?

06:35.040 --> 06:37.440
They're operating on him now.

06:37.480 --> 06:40.800
-He's in a really bad way.
-Tell me about the sedan.

06:40.840 --> 06:44.960
The driver was
a 26-year-old male.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Ethan Chambers,
he died on impact.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.680
[Harrow] A long way from home.

06:48.720 --> 06:50.360
[Colin] Adelaide.
We ran a background check.

06:50.400 --> 06:52.480
He's got a charge list
as long as your arm.

06:52.520 --> 06:54.320
Assault, theft,

06:54.360 --> 06:56.600
sale and possession
of stolen goods.

06:57.720 --> 06:59.080
-Including cigarettes?
-Yeah.

06:59.120 --> 07:00.640
There's a booming trade
for cheap ciggies

07:00.680 --> 07:02.040
in the mining towns.

07:02.080 --> 07:03.800
He did very well, too.

07:03.840 --> 07:07.440
We've found three grand
in cash so far.

07:09.520 --> 07:11.120
How did this happen?

07:11.160 --> 07:13.920
It's not a busy stretch of road,

07:13.960 --> 07:16.760
and yet, they ranstraight into each other?

07:16.800 --> 07:19.480
Sarge? One of the boys
have found something.

07:22.600 --> 07:24.360
[Colin] What is it?

07:25.520 --> 07:27.320
Dr. Harrow?

07:28.480 --> 07:31.160
[Harrow] A fingertip.

07:31.200 --> 07:34.840
[woman] Look at him!
He hasn't changed a bit.

07:34.880 --> 07:36.960
Still as handsome as ever.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.320
-[both grunt affectionately]
-Beverly, please.
You're being silly.

07:40.360 --> 07:43.720
Oh, don't be so modest, Lyle.You've always cut a fine figure.

07:43.760 --> 07:45.480
-[Harrow clears throat]
-[Beverly] Who's this?

07:45.520 --> 07:48.000
Daniel Harrow.
He's also up from Brisbane.

07:48.040 --> 07:51.000
-You're assisting Dr. Fairley?
-Assisting? No.
I'm also a pathologist.

07:51.040 --> 07:52.560
Really?

07:52.600 --> 07:54.960
It's so lovely to have
you back where you belong.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.840
We've had a soft spot for Lyle
ever since he locumed here.

07:57.880 --> 08:01.760
It broke our hearts when
he had to leave so suddenly.

08:01.800 --> 08:03.560
[Fairley] Now you,
I don't know.

08:03.600 --> 08:05.880
I don't know you either.
Edwina Gharam.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.920
This is Lyle Fairley!
And...?

08:07.960 --> 08:09.880
Daniel Harrow.

08:09.920 --> 08:12.800
Eddie's volunteered to
assist with the autopsies.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.640
She's got some
surgical experience.

08:17.040 --> 08:20.120
So, you live here
and you've never heard
of the famous Lyle Fairley?

08:20.160 --> 08:22.960
-Should I have?
-I like you already.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.640
The fingers on Mrs. Shepard'sleft hand are intact.

08:25.680 --> 08:28.480
[Harrow] Same with her right.
Fairley?

08:28.520 --> 08:32.039
Some superficial skin
abrasions, but no missing
nails or fingers.

08:32.080 --> 08:33.880
Then it must be Bob's.

08:33.919 --> 08:36.480
Can you confirm
he's missing a finger?

08:36.520 --> 08:38.880
He's still in surgery,but I'll go and check.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.480
[Fairley] Ooh,
this is interesting.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.919
-[door closes]
-Parallel abrasions
on the forearm.

08:42.960 --> 08:46.360
Given the pattern, I'd say
they were fingernail scratches.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.360
-From the crash?
-[Fairley] No.

08:48.400 --> 08:49.600
These look several days old.

08:51.680 --> 08:55.320
Daniel's taken his laptopwith him, but you can usehis desktop.

08:55.360 --> 08:58.800
You should be able to print outyour CV from there.

08:59.880 --> 09:02.240
-Here you go.
-Mm-hm.

09:02.280 --> 09:06.600
And, uh, if you need a refereewho's slightly more reliablethan your dad, I'm all yours.

09:06.640 --> 09:09.960
-Thanks, Maxine.
-It's really good
to see you, Fern.

10:19.040 --> 10:21.480
What would you prefer,
some snappy show tune?

10:21.520 --> 10:24.080
I would prefer something
resembling music.

10:24.120 --> 10:27.320
This sounds like a baby seal
being clubbed.

Why are you so snippy today?

10:28.760 --> 10:32.040

to be back home?

10:32.080 --> 10:33.320
Just keep it down.

10:35.080 --> 10:37.760
What's that scar on her abdomen?Did she have a C-section?

10:37.800 --> 10:40.600
No, she's had a hysterectomy.

I never knew that.

Oh, so there are some
secrets in the country?

10:50.240 --> 10:52.800
Bob Shepard's just
come out of surgery.

10:52.840 --> 10:54.840
He's not missing a fingertip.

10:56.360 --> 10:58.400
Then whose finger is it?

11:01.400 --> 11:04.720
Could there have beena fourth person in the crash?

11:04.760 --> 11:06.320
We didn't findany evidence of it.

11:06.360 --> 11:07.760
Apart from the fingertip.

11:07.800 --> 11:10.360
Assuming it came from
a living person.

11:10.400 --> 11:12.920
Look at the skin
where it's been severed.

11:12.960 --> 11:17.080
swollen, inflamed,
cell damage.

11:17.120 --> 11:20.680
That's exactly what happens
to tissue when exposed
to extreme cold.

11:20.720 --> 11:22.360
-You think it's been frozen?-Looks that way.

11:22.400 --> 11:23.880
What are you suggesting,
Harrow?

11:23.920 --> 11:26.440
One of the vehicles wastransporting frozen body parts?

11:26.480 --> 11:28.680
You did find those scratches
on Ethan Chambers' arm.

11:28.720 --> 11:32.400
Maybe he had
had an altercation
with someone--

11:32.440 --> 11:35.680
-Who he killed, froze,
and later disposed of.
-[Harrow] I don't know.

11:35.720 --> 11:39.960
But it might be worth taking
a closer look at those cars.

11:41.600 --> 11:43.840
They left for Eurallathis morning.

11:43.880 --> 11:45.480
After Simon,

11:45.520 --> 11:50.040
I thought it would be good tosend them both away for a while.

11:50.080 --> 11:51.840
I thought they could
help each other out.

11:51.880 --> 11:54.840
I had everything rightin Simon's autopsy.

11:54.880 --> 11:58.800
And he challenged my findingsand questioned me at every turn.

11:58.840 --> 12:02.040
I thought maybe he'd callto apologize, but...

12:06.360 --> 12:10.760
Why didn't you speak
with Simon's sister?

12:10.800 --> 12:13.240
Well, our job is to helpdetermine cause of death.

12:13.280 --> 12:14.960
That's half the job.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.560
We don't perform autopsies
for the sake of the dead.

12:17.600 --> 12:18.880
We do them for the living...

12:18.920 --> 12:21.800
find answers,
to provide some comfort.

12:24.280 --> 12:28.280
Harrow lost someone
he really loved.

12:28.320 --> 12:32.680
He was absolutely wrong to
challenge you like that, but...

12:32.720 --> 12:37.040
it was just his way
of dealing with his grief.

12:37.080 --> 12:41.360
And if you weren't so busy
avoiding your own,
you might've seen that.

12:48.240 --> 12:51.800
So, the chemist and
Ross Moran were mates
from the racetrack?

12:51.840 --> 12:54.800
[Fern] Yeah. And I thinkthe chemist owed someone money.

12:54.840 --> 12:56.720
Big money.

12:56.760 --> 12:58.120
And then Moran turns up dead.

12:59.640 --> 13:00.920
But here's the thing.

13:00.960 --> 13:03.600
Moran assaulted Simon
before he died.

13:05.640 --> 13:08.840
Dad thought it was allconnected, his shooting,the car burning,

13:08.880 --> 13:11.440
the Fentanyl,Simon's death.

13:11.480 --> 13:13.360
And then he just backed off,and I don't know why.

13:13.400 --> 13:16.120
Because the guy
who shot your dad is dead.

13:17.200 --> 13:18.560
Because his car
was a shitbox.

13:18.600 --> 13:20.600
Because Simon's death
was an accident.

13:20.640 --> 13:21.840
It says it right there.

13:23.880 --> 13:26.800
-Where are you going?
-Well, the chemist
must know something.

13:26.840 --> 13:29.080
-I'm gonna go talk to him.
-Are you crazy?

13:29.120 --> 13:32.000
For all we know, that could be
the guy who killed Moran!

13:32.040 --> 13:34.240
Promise me you
won't go near him.

13:34.280 --> 13:35.520
I won't go near him.

13:38.880 --> 13:41.560
Bye.

13:41.600 --> 13:44.160
[woman] It was touch-and-go
for a while there.

13:44.200 --> 13:47.600
We'll keep him sedated
overnight, but I'm hoping
he'll make a good recovery.

13:47.640 --> 13:50.280
I'd like to tell himabout Diane once he wakes.

13:50.320 --> 13:52.560
It might be easier
coming from an old friend.

13:52.600 --> 13:56.200
Thank you, doctor. Everything
they say about you is true.

14:00.880 --> 14:04.240
[Harrow] And what exactly
do they say about you?

14:04.280 --> 14:08.800
You know how much I like
a mystery, but this one
I can't work out.

14:08.840 --> 14:12.120
The whole town loves you.
Why?

14:13.720 --> 14:16.200
It's clearly not because
of your personality.

14:16.240 --> 14:18.520
And it's certainly
not because of your looks.

14:20.800 --> 14:23.240
Something happened here.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.880
-What did you do?
-[cell phone rings]

14:25.920 --> 14:28.680
[Fairley] Must be Pavich.
You should get that.

14:28.720 --> 14:30.800
This isn't over.

14:32.400 --> 14:34.680
-Harrow.
-Hey, it's me.

14:34.720 --> 14:36.240
Oh, hi.

14:36.280 --> 14:38.080
Look, you might want
to call me back later.

14:38.120 --> 14:40.520
I know things have been a bit
tense between us lately,

14:40.560 --> 14:43.640
which is weird, given we had
sex the first night we met--

14:43.680 --> 14:45.640
[disconnects call]

14:50.000 --> 14:53.280
If I were to tell you
it's not what you think,

14:53.320 --> 14:54.560
would you believe me?

14:57.840 --> 15:00.320
-What are you doing?
-I need to talk about this.

15:00.360 --> 15:03.280
I'm not sure if
it's any of your business.

15:03.320 --> 15:06.240
No, you're right.Who Grace invites between hersheets is her business.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.920
-Well, what then?
-I don't want to see her
getting hurt.

15:08.960 --> 15:10.680
Grace doesn't need that.

15:10.720 --> 15:12.240
I would never do that to her.

15:12.280 --> 15:17.040
You'd never mean to,but it's what you do, Harrow.

15:17.080 --> 15:20.160
You put people second to the joband they end up getting hurt.

15:20.200 --> 15:23.120
-I mean, just look at--
-Simon?

15:23.160 --> 15:24.960
He adored you.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.480
All he wantedwas to be just like you.

15:26.520 --> 15:27.720
I loved him!

15:27.760 --> 15:31.120
And he loved you,and look what happened.

15:33.040 --> 15:35.280
You're not a bad man, Harrow.

15:35.320 --> 15:37.840
But you ruin people.

15:43.440 --> 15:45.280
Harrow. Harrow--

16:01.800 --> 16:04.240
[sportscaster on TV,
indistinct]

16:10.640 --> 16:12.640
[dials]

16:12.680 --> 16:14.160
[cell phone beeping]

16:15.520 --> 16:17.640
No signal.

16:17.680 --> 16:19.240
[heavy sigh]

16:19.280 --> 16:21.920
I hate the outback.

16:39.200 --> 16:40.720
You don't like it?

16:43.080 --> 16:44.960
Not hungry. Sorry.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.640
Would you prefer a T-bone?

16:46.680 --> 16:48.400
Barramundi?

16:48.440 --> 16:49.840
Anything you like.It's on the house.

16:49.880 --> 16:51.760
Why is that?

16:51.800 --> 16:53.920
Because you'reLyle Fairley's assistant.

16:55.040 --> 16:56.960
Beverly mentioned you.

16:57.960 --> 16:59.800
Good old Beverly.

17:02.880 --> 17:04.079
Tell me something.

17:04.119 --> 17:06.400
What did he do?

17:06.440 --> 17:07.640
Sorry?

17:07.680 --> 17:09.319
Fairley.

17:09.359 --> 17:12.800
You obviously love the guy.
I mean, look at this place.

17:12.839 --> 17:14.200
It's like a shrine to him.

17:16.440 --> 17:20.680
There was a house fire
on one of the cattle stations
outside of town.

17:20.720 --> 17:23.800
Lyle was the firston the scene.

17:23.839 --> 17:25.720
The place was an inferno.

17:25.760 --> 17:28.160
But he ran into those flames

17:28.200 --> 17:32.080
and pulled those boys out,
one by one.

17:33.400 --> 17:36.400
He saved three lives that night.

17:39.440 --> 17:41.280
He never said anything.

17:41.320 --> 17:44.200
That's because he couldn't
save the fourth.

17:55.840 --> 17:57.840
[ice cracking]

18:11.080 --> 18:12.280
Thanks for doing this.

18:12.320 --> 18:13.680
I hope I haven't
ruined your evening.

18:13.720 --> 18:14.960
[laughs] In Euralla?

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
It's not likeI had a hot date lined up.

18:18.040 --> 18:20.120
Have you seenthe guys in this town?

18:20.160 --> 18:23.360
It's all hi-vis and bullshit.Literally.

18:23.400 --> 18:24.840
[both chuckle]

18:24.880 --> 18:26.440
Here's the histology slideyou asked for.

18:26.480 --> 18:29.600
-The fingertip.
-Thank you.

18:30.920 --> 18:32.440
What are you looking for?

18:32.480 --> 18:33.680
Free blood cells.

18:33.720 --> 18:36.320
-Why?
-Ahh...

18:39.800 --> 18:43.120
Look at the margin of the tip
where the flesh
has been severed.

18:43.160 --> 18:45.640
-See the blood cells?
-[Edwina] They're everywhere.

18:45.680 --> 18:49.160
Which means the blood
was still circulating
when the tip was frozen.

18:49.200 --> 18:52.120
So this person was alive
when freezing occurred.

18:52.160 --> 18:55.240
Alive, but suffering
from frostbite.

18:55.280 --> 18:58.800
Frostbite? It's 40 degrees
out there. How?

18:58.840 --> 19:00.840
I have no idea.Is Fairley joining us?

19:00.880 --> 19:03.520
He's getting ready for
the prayer service today
for Bob and Diane.

19:03.560 --> 19:05.240
But it's a good thing
you're here.

19:05.280 --> 19:07.520
-I just got the report
from Scientific.
-And?

19:07.560 --> 19:10.200
They've confirmed
that a fourth person
was in one of the vehicles.

19:10.240 --> 19:11.720
Ethan Chambers' car?

19:11.760 --> 19:14.400
No. Bob and Diane's.

19:14.440 --> 19:18.400
They found blood from an unknownperson on Diane's clothes.

19:18.440 --> 19:22.400
There were traces of iton the steering column as well.

19:24.720 --> 19:29.760
Perhaps they were trying
to climb out over Diane,
after the van had rolled.

19:29.800 --> 19:32.240
Explains how the blood
ended up on her clothes.

19:32.280 --> 19:33.880
What about the fingertip?

19:39.400 --> 19:42.280
Maybe it was severed
on broken glass or metal

19:42.320 --> 19:46.760
when its owner was trying
to climb out after the crash.

19:46.800 --> 19:50.360
But if there was another
person in the vehicle...

19:50.400 --> 19:52.840
they're still
out there somewhere.

19:52.880 --> 19:54.560
And likely in a very bad way.

19:54.600 --> 19:56.040
Then they couldn't
have gone far.

19:56.080 --> 19:58.120
Get onto Emergency Services.

19:58.160 --> 20:00.080
We need a search party
at the crash site ASAP.

20:00.120 --> 20:02.840
And get onto Cunnamulla,
see if they can spare
some extra bodies.

20:02.880 --> 20:05.640
We're going to need
all the help we can get.

20:30.920 --> 20:33.760
-What are you up to now?
-I'm improvising.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.000
Here, stir this.

20:35.040 --> 20:36.600
What is that?

20:36.640 --> 20:39.280
It's a piece of car seatfrom the transit van.

20:39.320 --> 20:42.440
It had a unusual stain on it.

20:42.480 --> 20:45.520
So, I'm trying to determineif it's biological.

20:45.560 --> 20:47.960
-Why?
-Because there was
another person in the van

20:48.000 --> 20:49.640
when it crashed.

20:49.680 --> 20:52.920
The middle seat belt had been
adjusted to be extra-long.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.720
I think that person
was pregnant.

20:54.760 --> 20:56.800
Hence the pregnancy stick.

20:56.840 --> 20:59.920
If I'm lucky, there will beenough fluid from the car seat

20:59.960 --> 21:01.880
for this pregnancy stick

21:01.920 --> 21:05.960
to detectHuman Chorionic Gonadotropin.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.880
HCG. Placental hormone.

21:07.920 --> 21:10.280
Also found in amniotic fluid.

21:10.320 --> 21:11.520
[door opens]

21:11.560 --> 21:13.520
What on earth is all this?

21:13.560 --> 21:15.640
Just a little experimentI've rigged up.

21:15.680 --> 21:18.880
-For the purposes of
the autopsy, I hope?
-Oh, absolutely.

21:18.920 --> 21:22.000
Dr. Harrow wouldn't
waste hospital resources
on anything else.

21:22.040 --> 21:24.240
Ron from the post office
dropped these off.

21:24.280 --> 21:28.680
They're addressed to Diane, but
she's in your care now, so...

21:28.720 --> 21:31.560
Mail-order pharmaceuticals.

21:31.600 --> 21:34.480
[Beverly] I thought it mightbe relevant, but I wasn't sure.

21:37.040 --> 21:40.280
-Contraceptive pills.
-But Diane had a hysterectomy.

21:40.320 --> 21:42.680
Why would she need
contraceptives?

21:44.200 --> 21:47.240
[sighs] Becausethey weren't her pills.

21:48.560 --> 21:50.320
Do you have a car I can borrow?

21:53.120 --> 21:54.720
Yes?

21:54.760 --> 21:57.640
[Harrow] There was
a pregnant woman in Bob's van!

21:57.680 --> 21:59.400
Her waters broke
during the crash.

21:59.440 --> 22:01.080
What?

22:01.120 --> 22:04.320
She must have wandered
away from the accident site.

22:04.360 --> 22:05.880
But she's still out there.

22:05.920 --> 22:07.560
I tried to call Colin

22:07.600 --> 22:09.200
-but I couldn't get through.-Where are you?

22:09.240 --> 22:11.920
I'm on my way
to Bob and Diane's.

22:11.960 --> 22:13.240
What? Why?

22:13.280 --> 22:15.880
There were pills, contraceptive pills,

22:15.920 --> 22:17.720
sent to Diane in the mail.

22:17.760 --> 22:20.160
No. There must be some mistake.

22:20.200 --> 22:21.840
Diane couldn't have children.

22:21.880 --> 22:23.880
I'm starting to think
Bob and Diane

22:23.920 --> 22:25.920
aren't the people
you thought they were.

22:25.960 --> 22:27.760
[Harrow breaking up]

22:53.560 --> 22:56.360
[jiggles locked door handle]

23:12.800 --> 23:16.280
This is exactly the sort
of maverick behavior
he indulges in all the time!

23:16.320 --> 23:20.760
Jumping to ridiculous
conclusions about people
he doesn't even know.

23:22.160 --> 23:23.400
Where's Bob?

23:29.000 --> 23:31.480
[door clatters]

23:49.920 --> 23:51.960
-[woman sobbing]
-[Bob shouting]

23:54.040 --> 23:56.000
[woman crying] No...

23:57.240 --> 23:59.600
No, let me out!

24:01.400 --> 24:03.000
[woman continues sobbing]
Let me out!

24:37.760 --> 24:39.920
[generator starts]

25:19.080 --> 25:21.080
[whimpering]

25:43.560 --> 25:45.240
[woman grunts, shivering]

25:49.760 --> 25:51.280
Ahh!

25:54.720 --> 25:57.280
[panting]

26:16.240 --> 26:18.560
[Harrow] No! No!

26:18.600 --> 26:21.520
-No! Help! No!
-[pounding on door]

26:22.640 --> 26:24.480
Bob!

26:26.840 --> 26:29.400
I know what happened, Bob!

26:30.880 --> 26:34.440
I know what you and Diane
did to that girl!

26:34.480 --> 26:37.320
You kept her locked up
in that room.

26:37.360 --> 26:41.240
And you used her as what,
a sex slave?

26:45.640 --> 26:48.120
I know you gave
her contraceptives, Bob.

26:49.600 --> 26:51.080
But she stopped taking them!

26:54.640 --> 26:57.320
Maybe she thought
if she was pregnant,

26:57.360 --> 26:58.680
you might let her go.

26:58.720 --> 27:00.960
Can't keep a babylocked up in there.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.680
Shut up!

27:05.040 --> 27:08.240
So you tried to get rid of her
before the baby was born.

27:08.280 --> 27:12.600
You put her in here,to try and freeze her to death.

27:12.640 --> 27:15.400
But she was clever.

27:15.440 --> 27:19.040
She must have got quite some
distance before you found her.

27:22.640 --> 27:25.320
[indistinct shouting]

27:27.520 --> 27:31.360
But a car crash was the last
thing you were expecting.

27:33.200 --> 27:35.000
-[woman yells]
-[tires screech]

27:39.760 --> 27:43.200
-You won't get away
with this, Bob.
-Yeah, we'll see.

27:43.240 --> 27:46.040
[Harrow]
The cops know I'm here.

27:46.080 --> 27:51.440
They will find out what you
and your wife have done.

27:52.760 --> 27:53.960
Bob?

27:54.000 --> 27:55.240
Bob!

27:57.680 --> 27:59.440
[whimpers]

28:08.720 --> 28:10.800
[grunts]

28:10.840 --> 28:12.080
[blows on hands]

28:30.160 --> 28:32.400
[alarm beeping]

28:43.480 --> 28:45.680
[thudding]

28:49.880 --> 28:52.480
[lock unlatching]

28:55.880 --> 28:58.760
-What the hell are you doing?
-Where is he?

28:58.800 --> 29:00.640
Where's Bob?

29:05.040 --> 29:06.440
Lyle?

29:08.040 --> 29:09.480
Oh, Bob...

29:11.160 --> 29:12.600
No, no. Stay back.

29:14.360 --> 29:15.600
Now, come on, Bob.

29:17.160 --> 29:19.960
Don't do anything rash.

29:21.360 --> 29:23.160
[grunting]

29:28.840 --> 29:32.680
Osoto-gari. One of
the original 40 throws.

29:34.120 --> 29:36.200
I shall never mock
your jujitsu again.

29:37.240 --> 29:40.080
Call Colin.

29:40.120 --> 29:42.280
Four bars? How do youget four bars out here?

29:47.840 --> 29:49.800
-[Colin] Lyle?
-No, it's Dan Harrow.

29:49.840 --> 29:51.280
I'm here with your brother.

29:51.320 --> 29:53.080
We apprehended Bob
at his property.

29:53.120 --> 29:55.800
I'll send a car, but I need
both of you here now!

30:03.200 --> 30:04.520
[woman groaning]

30:05.800 --> 30:07.080
Where is she?

30:07.120 --> 30:08.760
-Down there.
-[Colin] Quick as you can!

30:08.800 --> 30:12.680
If we don't get the baby outnow, we could lose both of them.

30:12.720 --> 30:15.280
-[Harrow] Contractions?
-[Colin] Every two minutes.

30:15.320 --> 30:17.600
-And her name?
-Kyra.

30:17.640 --> 30:22.280
Kyra, hi. I'm Dr. Harrow
and this is Dr. Fairley.

30:22.320 --> 30:25.320
-Two doctors?
-It's your lucky day.

30:25.360 --> 30:28.320
Now, look, Kyra, we are going
to get though this together.

30:28.360 --> 30:31.000
And Dr. Fairley here,he's gonna deliver.

30:31.040 --> 30:32.360
What?

30:32.400 --> 30:33.920
You did a semester of OBs.

30:33.960 --> 30:36.280
That was 25 years ago.

30:36.320 --> 30:38.160
And I know
you haven't forgotten.

30:39.480 --> 30:40.800
You can do this, Lyle.

30:41.800 --> 30:43.000
All right.

30:43.040 --> 30:44.440
-[groans]
-[Fairley] Okay, Kyra.

30:44.480 --> 30:46.440
Let's do this together.

30:48.880 --> 30:50.320
Here come the shoulders now.

30:51.440 --> 30:53.640
-[painful groan]
-Good girl.

30:53.680 --> 30:55.120
[Fairley chuckles]

30:55.160 --> 30:59.320
[groans and cries]

30:59.360 --> 31:02.000
[baby cries]

31:04.480 --> 31:06.280
It's a little girl.

31:07.600 --> 31:09.680
Here. It's so beautiful.

31:19.120 --> 31:20.800
[Kyra] I was...

31:20.840 --> 31:24.160
hitchhiking down to Adelaide
when they picked me up.

31:27.920 --> 31:29.400
They seemed nice.

31:31.400 --> 31:33.520
And when we got to Euralla,they...

31:33.560 --> 31:37.680
offered me a place to stayfor a couple of nights.

31:37.720 --> 31:39.760
How long were you there?

31:43.000 --> 31:44.600
Three years.

31:48.040 --> 31:49.760
I fought back...

31:50.880 --> 31:52.680
every day.

31:52.720 --> 31:56.640
I did... everythingI could to get out.

31:56.680 --> 32:01.120
But they were justas determined as I was.

32:01.160 --> 32:05.000
I didn't think that they
could hurt an unborn baby.

32:06.840 --> 32:08.240
I was wrong.

32:13.640 --> 32:15.000
You saved her.

32:18.120 --> 32:19.840
[Kyra] No.

32:23.200 --> 32:24.840
She saved me.

32:29.840 --> 32:32.760
You boys better get going
if you want to make the plane.

32:32.800 --> 32:35.320
Come on.
I'll see you out.

32:40.800 --> 32:43.040
Uh, hello?

32:43.080 --> 32:45.680
Forgotten something?

32:45.720 --> 32:47.360
My car keys?

32:47.400 --> 32:49.880
Shit! Yes, sorry.

32:49.920 --> 32:51.800
I completely forgot.

32:53.080 --> 32:54.320
Thank you.

32:56.120 --> 32:58.920
It's about the puzzle,
isn't it?

32:58.960 --> 33:01.160
That's why you do this.

33:02.600 --> 33:04.800
Seems you like
solving puzzles, too.

33:06.520 --> 33:08.560
Take care, Edwina.

33:16.880 --> 33:19.640
Wasn't the plane supposed
to be here at four?

33:25.040 --> 33:27.520
You okay?

33:35.000 --> 33:37.600
We did a good thing today.

33:39.320 --> 33:41.200
I know.

33:44.240 --> 33:49.440
I wanted to apologize for what
I said to you yesterday.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.320
You have nothing
to apologize for.

33:58.040 --> 33:59.840
You're right.

34:01.880 --> 34:05.480
Simon was obsessing
over my case.

34:07.640 --> 34:11.840
If he hadn't mixed his epilepsy
drugs with Modafinil, then...

34:15.800 --> 34:19.000
I'll never forgive myself
for what happened.

34:23.800 --> 34:28.679
You kept asking me whyI have been so snippy with you.

34:28.719 --> 34:31.960
It wasn't justbecause of Simon.

34:32.000 --> 34:36.639
It was also because...I love this place.

34:38.560 --> 34:40.679
And I hate it, too.

34:43.360 --> 34:45.719
Because of the fire?

34:50.000 --> 34:54.199
I was meant to beat the hospital that night,working.

34:55.199 --> 34:56.880
But I was at another property,

34:56.920 --> 35:00.760
looking into an unusual death,
when the call came through.

35:03.160 --> 35:05.520
I was in the local
fire brigade back then,

35:05.560 --> 35:08.360
and knew that the hospital
was close to the house.

35:08.400 --> 35:11.840
So, I got the first call.

35:11.880 --> 35:16.960
But it took me an extra five
minutes to get to that fire.

35:19.440 --> 35:22.520
[voice shaking] That boy died...

35:22.560 --> 35:24.320
because I was off,

35:24.360 --> 35:29.760
indulging my curiosityon a case that wasn't even mine.

35:34.680 --> 35:38.120
I promised myself I wouldnever let that happen again.

35:44.120 --> 35:48.280
Well, you stuck your neck out
today, and look what happened.

35:49.320 --> 35:51.720
You saved three of us.

35:57.080 --> 35:59.200
[cell phone chimes]

36:00.280 --> 36:02.320
Oh, it's Colin.

36:03.480 --> 36:05.520
"Your flight's been canceled.

36:05.560 --> 36:07.920
But Maxine says
you can keep the rental."

36:07.960 --> 36:11.480
We have to drive back?

36:11.520 --> 36:14.080
[groans] It's only six hours.

36:14.120 --> 36:18.000
Six hours... in a car...with you?

36:18.040 --> 36:20.040
Come on, Harrow.

36:20.080 --> 36:22.280
It'll be fun!

36:22.320 --> 36:26.640
Besides, I've got plenty
to keep us occupied.

36:30.240 --> 36:32.040
I downloaded a new opera.

36:32.080 --> 36:33.440
I like opera.

36:37.360 --> 36:39.560
Chinese opera...

36:40.640 --> 36:43.120
-in Cantonese.
-[engine starts]

36:43.160 --> 36:44.800
[woman sings in Cantonese]

36:44.840 --> 36:47.360
[Harrow] Does it have
to be this loud?

36:47.400 --> 36:50.280
[Fairley] Oh...
now who's being snippy?

37:03.440 --> 37:06.920
[Fern] You don't know who I am,but I know what you did.

37:06.960 --> 37:10.600
You planted the Fentanyl
in my apartment.

37:10.640 --> 37:12.280
[scoffs]

37:12.320 --> 37:14.760
You robbed yourself soyou could get out of your debt.

37:17.640 --> 37:19.800
I don't know what
you're talking about.

37:19.840 --> 37:21.840
-I could end up in jail
for what you did!
-I didn't set you up.

37:21.880 --> 37:23.240
I don't even know
where you live.

37:23.280 --> 37:25.160
Bullshit! You and Moranare both involved in this.

37:25.200 --> 37:27.160
Did you kill him?

37:28.160 --> 37:30.080
Ross Moran's dead?

37:30.120 --> 37:31.880
You have to get out of here.

37:31.920 --> 37:33.720
No, I'm not going anywhere
until I have answers!

37:33.760 --> 37:35.400
Look, I'm so sorry
you got caught up in this.

37:35.440 --> 37:37.480
I had no idea what he was goingto do with those drugs.

37:37.520 --> 37:39.920
-Who? Who are talking about?
-You have to leave now!

37:39.960 --> 37:41.280
Please, tell me
who did this to me!

37:41.320 --> 37:43.680
The less you know the better.Now, go!

37:53.960 --> 37:55.240
What are you doing up here?

37:56.920 --> 37:58.840
Why did youhang up on me?

37:58.880 --> 38:02.600
Because your uncle
heard everything.

38:03.840 --> 38:05.160
He knows?

38:06.720 --> 38:08.720
[groans]

38:11.560 --> 38:13.320
What were you
calling me about?

38:16.200 --> 38:18.600
Maxine suggested thatI may have been...

38:21.080 --> 38:22.880
insensitive about Simon,

38:22.920 --> 38:26.640
the way I was proprietaryabout his autopsy.

38:28.080 --> 38:30.760
And that I'm not goodat dealing with grief.

38:33.120 --> 38:34.960
And I'm not good
at being wrong.

38:36.640 --> 38:40.200
But I was wrong about
the Modafinil.

38:42.240 --> 38:45.800
I think I've been wrong
about a lot of things lately.

38:54.560 --> 38:57.800
Your uncle thinks
I ruin people.

38:59.360 --> 39:01.160
Well, what do you think?

39:02.400 --> 39:05.040
I think that, too.

39:06.960 --> 39:10.480
And I really don't want
to do that to you.

39:11.880 --> 39:14.920
I can take care of myself.

39:16.120 --> 39:18.160
I know you can.

39:18.200 --> 39:20.560
[cell phone rings]

39:27.560 --> 39:29.360
You'd better answer that.

39:35.600 --> 39:38.520
[Pavich] Your office. Now.

39:39.760 --> 39:41.120
Shut the door.

39:43.200 --> 39:46.520
You know we monitor the browsinghistory of our employees, right?

39:46.560 --> 39:48.960
Oh... This about
those cat videos?

39:49.000 --> 39:50.880
How many people have you told
about Chester?

39:53.960 --> 39:56.720
Fern was in here...yesterday.

39:57.920 --> 39:59.200
She cracked your password

39:59.240 --> 40:01.560
and got access to allyour autopsy files.

40:01.600 --> 40:04.120
Ross Moran and Simon.

40:04.160 --> 40:06.840
Now, I don't knowwhat you've told her,but this has to stop.

40:06.880 --> 40:09.840
-Unless you know
something I don't.
-No.

40:09.880 --> 40:12.680
Good. Then let it go, Daniel.

40:12.720 --> 40:14.600
Before somebody else gets hurt.

40:22.720 --> 40:25.000
I'm sorry, did that hurt?

40:25.040 --> 40:26.240
[grunts]

40:27.720 --> 40:29.840
What have you done?

40:29.880 --> 40:32.120
What was that?

40:32.160 --> 40:33.600
Succinylcholine.

40:34.600 --> 40:35.800
No!

40:35.840 --> 40:37.160
No! [grunting]

40:44.280 --> 40:47.040
That drug does work quite fast.

40:47.080 --> 40:48.520
Please!

40:49.800 --> 40:51.680
You promised me,
if I got you the Fentanyl

40:51.720 --> 40:52.920
you'd leave me alone.

41:04.960 --> 41:07.040
[inhales deeply]

41:07.080 --> 41:09.160
Ohh... I'd love one of these.

41:10.880 --> 41:12.120
It's just so bad
for your health.

41:13.840 --> 41:15.200
Don't do this!

41:16.480 --> 41:17.880
Please, Francis!

41:17.920 --> 41:19.880
No!

41:21.840 --> 41:24.600
No! [screams] Please!

41:27.880 --> 41:29.840
[groaning]
