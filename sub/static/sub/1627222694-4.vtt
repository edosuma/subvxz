00:11.886 --> 00:13.596
[John B]<i> There's a moment</i>
<i>in every kid's life</i>

00:13.680 --> 00:15.515
<i>when you feel like anything's possible.</i>

00:16.641 --> 00:18.601
<i>When you feel like</i>
<i>you've got the total mojo.</i>

00:19.144 --> 00:21.938
<i>You could, I don't know,</i>
<i>free-climb El Capitan,</i>

00:22.564 --> 00:25.692
<i>land on Mars, or, uh...</i>
<i>get elected president.</i>

00:27.277 --> 00:30.530
<i>The whole world's there for the taking</i>
<i>if you've got the sack to go for it.</i>

00:31.573 --> 00:33.324
<i>And then, when you least expect it,</i>

00:34.284 --> 00:38.455
<i>some Kook shows up and tells you</i>
<i>there's no eternal mystery.</i>

00:39.873 --> 00:44.794
<i>And then all that talk aboutÂ free-climbing</i>
<i>and Mars and the president... bullshit.</i>

00:45.462 --> 00:47.380
<i>Magic gets cancer and dies.</i>

00:47.922 --> 00:51.342
[John B sighs] It's not there.
Look, just-- just pull the drone up.

00:51.426 --> 00:52.802

00:53.219 --> 00:54.262

[Pope] Look, we can do another pass.
recharge the battery.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.683
We can-- we can go back down.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.270
[JJ] We've done it three times.
There's nothing there.

01:02.353 --> 01:04.522
-[Kie] Shut up!
-What? It's true!

01:04.606 --> 01:06.441
The gold could be buried. We don't know.

01:06.524 --> 01:08.443
[John B] If it was there,
it would've been found

01:08.526 --> 01:09.736
on the metal detector, okay?

01:10.862 --> 01:12.197
Somebody beat us to it.

01:13.031 --> 01:14.532
Or it was never there.

01:17.660 --> 01:19.287
[thunder rumbling]

01:53.780 --> 01:55.073
[social worker] Hey, buddy.

02:01.663 --> 02:05.834
You know, Cheryl,
it's kind of a bad time for a check-in.

02:06.417 --> 02:08.378
Not a check-in. We're here to take you.

02:08.837 --> 02:10.213
Today? Really?

02:10.672 --> 02:12.465
It's just for a few weeks
until your hearing.

02:12.549 --> 02:16.177
No, no, no. Cheryl, look,
I'm not going into foster care, okay?

02:16.261 --> 02:18.429
I'm not gonna go be a part
of your little system.

02:18.847 --> 02:19.722
[radio beeps]

02:19.806 --> 02:22.058
[Cheryl] John B, this is Deputy Thomas.

02:22.600 --> 02:25.228
He works with juveniles
for the sheriff's department.

02:27.564 --> 02:30.525
Look, I know Uncle T is
down in Mississippi working at a casino.

02:30.608 --> 02:31.901
He hasn't been here in months.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.403
What? [scoffs]

02:34.946 --> 02:37.991
No, see, that's my nightmare right there.
Look, I-- I--

02:38.950 --> 02:39.868
I want emancipation.

02:39.951 --> 02:42.537
Emancipation from who?
There's nobody here but you.

02:42.620 --> 02:43.580
Uh... asylum, then.

02:43.663 --> 02:46.749
-On what grounds?
-On-- on solid grounds. On holy grounds.

02:46.833 --> 02:50.420
Look, I feel real-- real prosecuted
right now by you and...

02:51.087 --> 02:52.505
especially Mr. Big Head over here.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.925
What are you lookin' at, bro?
What're you gonna do? You gonna tase me?

02:58.511 --> 03:00.180
-John!
-Oh, yeah, you wanna dance, huh?

03:01.890 --> 03:03.558
-Come here, you little--
-No, no, no, no.

03:03.641 --> 03:05.476
I didn't do anything!
Cheryl, get your dog off!

03:05.560 --> 03:07.645
-[Cheryl] That's enough!
-[John B] Okay, okay, okay!

03:07.729 --> 03:09.731
-Relax, John.
-[John B] Okay, okay. I give up.

03:17.697 --> 03:19.407
[radio chatter]

03:23.494 --> 03:24.579
See this, Cheryl?

03:25.538 --> 03:26.748
Do you know who this is?

03:27.457 --> 03:28.666
Yeah, it's my dad.

03:29.083 --> 03:30.376
And do you know what he wanted?

03:30.919 --> 03:34.589
He wanted me to stay here, at home,
and you're taking me away from home.

03:34.672 --> 03:36.007
Do you understand that?

03:38.176 --> 03:39.469
It's the law, John B.

03:43.348 --> 03:45.225
The law. [scoffs]

03:52.941 --> 03:54.943
[radio chatter]

04:02.742 --> 04:04.452
[John B] No, stop, stop, stop.
Please stop!

04:04.535 --> 04:06.663
My picture! It's the last picture
of my dad. Please.

04:06.746 --> 04:09.290
-Not gonna happen, kid.
-[John B] Come on. Just stop the car.

04:09.374 --> 04:11.376
-[Cheryl] Tom.
-Please. That's all I've got left.

04:11.960 --> 04:12.794
[Cheryl] Pull over.

04:12.877 --> 04:14.921
-You want me to pull over?
-[Cheryl] Just pull over.

04:15.004 --> 04:15.838
Thank you.

04:18.758 --> 04:20.134
[radio chatter]

04:26.391 --> 04:28.935
-Cheryl, can I help him look? Please?
-[Cheryl] He's got it.

04:30.436 --> 04:32.605
[John B] This idiot.
He's not looking in the right place.

04:33.147 --> 04:34.983
It's gonna get trashed. Cheryl, please.

04:35.066 --> 04:38.403
It's my final keepsake of my dad.
Are you really gonna let that happen?

04:38.903 --> 04:39.779
Please.

04:39.862 --> 04:41.656
-[sighs]
-[John B] I'm begging you.

04:43.074 --> 04:44.158
Make it quick.

04:44.701 --> 04:45.743
[unlocks doors]

04:45.827 --> 04:46.744
Yes, ma'am.

04:51.082 --> 04:51.958
Thanks, Cheryl.

04:52.875 --> 04:54.669
Later, Thomas! Ha-ha!

04:54.752 --> 04:55.628
Shit.

04:56.212 --> 04:57.338
Thomas!

04:57.422 --> 04:58.631
[horns blaring]

05:02.468 --> 05:03.845
Gah!

05:09.851 --> 05:11.561
-Hey, what's up, Jorge?
-What's up, bro?

05:11.644 --> 05:13.354
[John B]
Hey, look, there's a snow leopard.

05:13.438 --> 05:14.731
-Sorry.
-[Jorge] What the hell?

05:14.814 --> 05:16.899
-I'll give it back. I promise.
-[Jorge] You better!

05:16.983 --> 05:19.319
-I swear. I'll leave it at the park.
-Come on, dude.

05:25.825 --> 05:27.535
[John B] Look out, you guys!
Comin' in hot!

05:28.870 --> 05:30.705
[John B] <i>There's a saying</i>

05:47.555 --> 05:50.266
Did you just yeet over that chain?

05:50.350 --> 05:52.810
-Oh...
-Oh, my God. Holy shit, your shirt.

05:53.478 --> 05:54.645
-Oh, wow.
-[Sarah gasps] Okay.

05:54.729 --> 05:56.856
-Yeah, that's not ideal.
-That's not good at all.

05:56.939 --> 05:59.400
-[John B] Take me to the hospital.
-[Sarah] Right now?

05:59.484 --> 06:01.944
-Yeah, right now. That'd be fantastic.
-[Sarah] Yeah, okay.

06:02.028 --> 06:04.739
-Okay, well, you have to get up.
-[sighs] Three, two, one. God.

06:06.741 --> 06:09.744
Hey, do you-- do you see a car?
Like a-- like a cop SUV?

06:09.827 --> 06:12.830
-Blue and white, maybe?
-Yes, there is a blue and white cop SUV.

06:12.914 --> 06:15.917
-Shit. Do you see a guy with no neck?
-[car doors slamming]

06:16.000 --> 06:18.211
[Sarah] There is a guy.
He, in fact, does not have a neck.

06:18.294 --> 06:19.420
There's a woman with him.

06:19.504 --> 06:21.589
-What are-- what are they doing?
-[Sarah] They're...

06:23.800 --> 06:24.884
just...

06:24.967 --> 06:27.553
-Can you-- can you just go, please?
-That's-- that's what I'm doing.

06:27.637 --> 06:30.139
-Thank you. Thank you.
-They are stopped at the dead bike.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.768
Why are the cops after you?
What, did you rob a bank?

06:33.851 --> 06:35.686
It's probably better if you don't know.

06:36.354 --> 06:38.523
What are you, like, a fugitive, John B?

06:38.606 --> 06:40.942
I don't know,
more like a refugee or something.

06:41.984 --> 06:44.153
Hey, you know what?
Don't take me to the hospital.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.780
Just take a left, please.

06:45.863 --> 06:47.949
-I gotta do somethin'.
-[Sarah] All right.

06:49.367 --> 06:50.368
Come on.

07:00.461 --> 07:01.379
Whew.

07:01.462 --> 07:02.672

07:02.755 --> 07:04.841

Boat like this don't just sink,
Dr. Thornton.

07:10.972 --> 07:12.598
How much is this gonna cost me?

07:12.682 --> 07:17.061
Ah, submerged 24 hours,
so you're lookin' at 25, 30K.

07:17.145 --> 07:18.604
And insurance won't cover it?

07:18.688 --> 07:22.316
[chuckles] No. Not for operator error.
Plug wasn't in there.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.903
-Well, why-- why you lookin' at me?
-Why do you think?

07:25.987 --> 07:29.490
I did not forget to put the plug in, Mom.
It's been sitting in the water a week.

07:29.574 --> 07:31.033
I thought that when you turned 16,

07:31.117 --> 07:33.035
you'd take more responsibility
for your actions.

07:33.119 --> 07:35.121
[Topper] Mom, I did not do this!
Are you kidding me?

07:35.204 --> 07:36.539
You think I'm that stupid?

07:37.081 --> 07:38.207
Why is this my fault?

07:39.459 --> 07:40.877
Because it usually is.

07:42.587 --> 07:44.046
[Dr. Thornton sighs]

07:45.631 --> 07:48.050
My mom thinks that I did it...

07:48.134 --> 07:50.970
-[rap music playing on radio]
-...even though there's no way I could've.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.472
I mean, how?

07:53.306 --> 07:55.475
It's always my fault, no matter what.

07:55.558 --> 07:57.852
She just-- she just wants me
to be this little robot

07:57.935 --> 07:59.729
that-- that just checks her boxes.

07:59.812 --> 08:02.106
You know what I mean? SAT prep? Oh, check.

08:02.190 --> 08:04.025
Serving food at the shelter? Check.

08:04.108 --> 08:07.403
I mean, I do-- I literally do everything
she wants, and I'm sick of it.

08:07.904 --> 08:09.864
Well, we know who did it, right?

08:09.947 --> 08:11.199
It was that little geek Pope.

08:11.741 --> 08:14.327
Pope, yeah.
Rafe, if you wouldn't have jumped him

08:14.410 --> 08:16.746
on the golf course,
I'd still have a boat, right?

08:17.288 --> 08:20.583
Sorry if I, uh... had your back

08:20.666 --> 08:23.044
after some Pogue put a--
put a gun to your head.

08:24.045 --> 08:25.922
Listen, man, I am not the enemy here.

08:26.672 --> 08:28.508
-Am I the enemy here? I'm not the enemy.
-No.

08:28.591 --> 08:30.718
-I didn't sink the boat.Â Pope did.
-Okay. All right.

08:30.801 --> 08:34.347
And you need to force him
to take some personal responsibility, bro.

08:34.430 --> 08:37.183
Bro, he sank the boat, all right?
That shit can't stand.

08:37.266 --> 08:38.726
So what are you gonna do about it?

08:42.730 --> 08:44.732
-[Sarah] <i>We've gotta clean that wound.</i>
-[John B] <i>No.</i>

08:44.815 --> 08:46.234
Sarah, I-- I cannot be here.

08:46.317 --> 08:49.403
-[Sarah] Okay, well, you have to trust me.
-Yeah, I did that one time already.

08:49.487 --> 08:51.906
We've already been through this.
I didn't rat you out, okay?

08:51.989 --> 08:53.241
So suck it up, buttercup.

08:57.370 --> 09:00.081
Hey, I don't think your old man
would be happy if an ex-employee

09:00.164 --> 09:02.166
-was bleeding all over his house.
-Shh!

09:02.792 --> 09:03.751
So don't bleed.

09:10.174 --> 09:11.217
[Ward] Hey!

09:11.300 --> 09:15.179
Jerry, don't tell me
we can't renegotiate the rate.

09:15.263 --> 09:17.098
We can absolutely renegotiate
the rate, Jerry.

09:17.181 --> 09:18.516
That's what we're doing right now.

09:18.599 --> 09:20.309
-[Sarah] Hi!
-What are you doing?

09:20.393 --> 09:21.769
[Sarah] Well, what do you mean?

09:22.478 --> 09:25.106
-Shut the door. Come on, sweetie.
-Sorry.

09:25.982 --> 09:26.816
[Ward] No!

09:27.149 --> 09:28.109
I will!

09:32.071 --> 09:34.323
Go in here. Sit down. I'll be right back.

09:40.371 --> 09:41.247
Whoa.

09:44.041 --> 09:45.543
[clinking]

09:46.460 --> 09:47.336
Okay.

09:49.672 --> 09:51.048
-Lift up your shirt.
-Phew.

09:51.132 --> 09:53.259
-Okay.
-That's gotta be disinfected.

09:54.051 --> 09:54.885
Oh...

09:57.346 --> 09:59.056
-Wait, is that rubbing alcohol?
-[Sarah] Yes.

09:59.682 --> 10:01.142
It's the only way to be safe.

10:01.559 --> 10:03.227
-Okay, close your eyes.
-[sighs]

10:03.311 --> 10:04.437
On the count of three.

10:05.479 --> 10:07.315
-Ready? One, two...
-[John B] Two...

10:07.398 --> 10:10.151
-[screams]
-Shh! Are you kidding me?

10:10.610 --> 10:12.820
-My God.
-Sorry.

10:12.903 --> 10:15.156
Never heard anyone whine like that before.

10:15.239 --> 10:16.449
[groans]

10:17.325 --> 10:18.242
Stop.

10:18.326 --> 10:19.994
-Excuse you.
-Sorry. Sorry.

10:21.287 --> 10:23.080
Who, uh... who's the dude on the wall?

10:24.248 --> 10:26.834
Oh, it's Denmark Tanny,
founder of Tannyhill.

10:26.917 --> 10:28.753
-[John B exhales] Founder?
-Mm-hm.

10:29.962 --> 10:33.716
So, how did a slave
found a cotton plantation?

10:33.799 --> 10:34.967
He was a free man.

10:35.468 --> 10:36.636
He's kind of a mystery.

10:36.719 --> 10:37.970
He showed up out of nowhere

10:38.054 --> 10:40.556
and paid for all of the land around here
in gold.

10:41.807 --> 10:43.225
-In gold?
-Mm-hm.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.520
Hey, wh-- I'm not finished, Sancho.

10:49.649 --> 10:50.775
[John B] Denmark Tanny.

10:50.858 --> 10:52.276
I-- I recognize that name.

10:54.528 --> 10:56.322
He-- he was on the Royal Merchant.

11:01.369 --> 11:02.787
But there was no survivors.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.250
What else do you know about this guy?

11:08.918 --> 11:14.215
When we first moved in, we found a diary,
an almanac, a bunch of papers.

11:14.298 --> 11:17.385
Ward donated all of it
to the state archives at Chapel Hill.

11:18.386 --> 11:19.387
Can I go see that?

11:19.470 --> 11:20.346
See what?

11:20.971 --> 11:22.807
The-- the archives.
I need-- I need to see them.

11:22.890 --> 11:26.268
I mean, I can get you in if you want.
He's got a trustee pass.

11:26.352 --> 11:27.395
Yeah, yeah. I need that.

11:28.020 --> 11:29.021
To Chapel Hill?

11:29.105 --> 11:30.189
Yes. Right now.

11:31.941 --> 11:32.983
Why now?

11:33.067 --> 11:34.819
I... I can't tell you that.

11:35.361 --> 11:36.737
More fugitive stuff?

11:36.821 --> 11:39.740
Uh... fugitive adjacent, sort of.

11:39.824 --> 11:41.701
It's, um...
it's a matter of national security.

11:42.493 --> 11:44.870
I've just waited my entire life
for someone to say that to me.

11:44.954 --> 11:48.249
Look-- God. I know this sounds crazy,
but I really need to borrow that pass.

11:48.332 --> 11:51.627
The less you know, the better.
Okay? You've just-- you've gotta trust me.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.713
No. I don't trust anyone.

11:53.796 --> 11:55.965
Especially not with a trustee pass.

11:56.465 --> 11:58.134
I need to go now.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.344
-Okay, then I'm coming with you.
-[John B] No.

12:00.428 --> 12:01.303
Yes.

12:01.929 --> 12:03.389
One last mission,

12:03.472 --> 12:07.226
and then I'm out of this dirty,
dirty game.

12:07.810 --> 12:08.644
-[slap]
-[groans]

12:08.728 --> 12:09.729
Come on. Let's go.

12:10.229 --> 12:11.272
[door opens]

12:28.622 --> 12:29.999
[chuckles]

12:32.710 --> 12:34.086
[gunshot]

12:35.421 --> 12:36.839
-[Pope] JJ!
-What was that?

12:36.922 --> 12:37.923
-[fires gun]
-JJ!

12:38.007 --> 12:40.301
-That's what I thought, man.
-JJ!

12:41.510 --> 12:42.428
They know.

12:43.554 --> 12:44.847
-[JJ] What?
-They know.

12:45.639 --> 12:48.350
All right, chill, bro. All right?
They don't know shit.

12:48.726 --> 12:51.353
-Topper knows I sunk his boat.
-[JJ] How do you know they know?

12:51.437 --> 12:55.107
Because Rafe and Topper posted
outside of Heyward's and mad dogged me.

12:55.191 --> 12:58.277
Will you calm down and get a grip, man?
They don't know shit.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.446
They have cameras. They could've seen me.

13:00.905 --> 13:02.907
There was no power.
How could they have seen you?

13:02.990 --> 13:04.617
It's Figure Eight. They got generators.

13:04.992 --> 13:07.912
They don't give scholarships to kids
who vengefully sink boats.

13:07.995 --> 13:11.457
-It's not a good look on my transcript.
-Enough with the regret, bro!

13:11.540 --> 13:12.666
They caved your face in.

13:13.459 --> 13:15.628
They hit us, we hit them.
It's the law of the jungle.

13:16.754 --> 13:20.466
Now, if any Kooks come up to you
and ask if you had anything to do with it,

13:21.008 --> 13:23.886
you walk up to 'em,
look 'em right in the eye,

13:24.887 --> 13:25.763
and...

13:27.932 --> 13:31.185
-Deny the living shit out of it.
-That's right. Deny, deny, deny.

13:32.269 --> 13:36.065
But just for safety, we don't go anywhere
without protection.

13:37.483 --> 13:38.400
Right?

13:48.786 --> 13:50.246
Got a couple things to show you.

13:51.121 --> 13:52.331
I should close the door.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.210
I've been doing
a little investigative work.

13:56.293 --> 13:58.295
A little recon on my own time.

13:58.379 --> 14:00.506
-Is that so?
-Uh-huh.

14:02.591 --> 14:04.760
Found this in Scooter Grubbs' motel room.

14:07.429 --> 14:09.139
That is the Royal Merchant.

14:10.057 --> 14:11.392
At least, it looks like it.

14:11.475 --> 14:13.394
Now, I didn't know what to make of it,

14:13.477 --> 14:16.188
then, those two mainlanders
turned up in the gill net.

14:17.189 --> 14:19.525
That was in their truck beneath the seat.

14:21.694 --> 14:24.280
Three people lookin'
for the Merchant drowned.<i> </i>Okay.

14:24.363 --> 14:26.949
One was a drunk fool,
the others were from off.

14:27.032 --> 14:28.576
Didn't know the currents.

14:28.659 --> 14:30.202
Yeah, that's what I thought.

14:31.328 --> 14:33.622
Until this washed up.

14:34.623 --> 14:36.625
Murder was the case that they gave me.

14:38.002 --> 14:39.128
Coroner's report.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.464
When was the last time you had a homicide?

14:42.798 --> 14:45.676
-A long time.
-Mm-hm.

14:46.927 --> 14:48.012
Look at that.

14:48.095 --> 14:50.931
I mean, who in God's name
could do that to a person?

14:51.015 --> 14:53.392
[Peterkin] This is the guy
that chased John B through town.

14:53.475 --> 14:56.312
[deputy] Cheryl said he bolted
when she went to pick him up for DCS.

14:56.395 --> 14:57.813
Jumped out of the squad car.

14:58.439 --> 15:01.525
Maybe the kid's stepped up
to the big leagues.

15:04.403 --> 15:05.237
Okay.

15:05.988 --> 15:06.822
Good job.

15:07.656 --> 15:08.490
Thanks.

15:10.576 --> 15:11.785
[door opens]

15:14.079 --> 15:15.164
[door closes]

15:16.123 --> 15:18.626
-[man 1] Two more on the dolly!
-[ship horn blares]

15:18.709 --> 15:20.377
-[Sarah] Uh...
-No, no, no, no.

15:20.461 --> 15:21.587
-Oh, no.
-Hey, excuse me, sir?

15:21.670 --> 15:22.880
Wait, wait. Are you sold out?

15:22.963 --> 15:24.506
[man 2] You aren't the only ones.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.759
[John B] God damn it. Oh, shit.

15:27.760 --> 15:28.802
[Sarah] Um...

15:29.678 --> 15:30.721
Hey, follow me.

15:30.804 --> 15:33.057
-Okay, yeah. Sure, okay.
-[John B] Um...

15:33.140 --> 15:35.768
-Hey, so, have you ever been on a tugboat?
-[Sarah] A what?

15:35.851 --> 15:37.227
You're not serious.

15:37.311 --> 15:39.146
[John B] We gotta talk our way
onto this barge.

15:39.229 --> 15:40.522
-Okay.
-I got this.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.608
-Oh-- okay.
-These are my people. Just wait.

15:44.276 --> 15:46.445
[clears throat] Hey, Cap!

15:47.321 --> 15:48.405
So, question for you...

15:48.489 --> 15:51.784
Um... look, me and my sister really need
to get on this boat, man. Can we hop on?

15:53.035 --> 15:53.869
No.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.163
-Just-- just help a brother out.
-[captain] No.

15:57.915 --> 15:59.625
-Can't do it.
-Thanks for nothing.

16:01.293 --> 16:02.628
[clears throat]

16:04.797 --> 16:06.465
-So...
-[John B] Um...

16:06.966 --> 16:07.967
So...

16:09.385 --> 16:10.219
they're booked.

16:11.095 --> 16:11.929
Who?

16:12.346 --> 16:15.766
-Your, uh... your-- your people?
-[John B] What, you got a better idea?

16:16.600 --> 16:17.434
Yeah.

16:22.731 --> 16:24.441
-Here.
-[clears throat]<i> </i>Okay.

16:25.526 --> 16:26.902
[Sarah] Okay, grab a tank.

16:28.445 --> 16:29.321
Hurry.

16:39.498 --> 16:41.917
-[man] We're about to shove off.
-[Sarah] Oh, my God.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.752
[man] Gotta go down to the engine room.

16:44.962 --> 16:46.005
[Sarah] Sorry.

16:46.588 --> 16:48.090
[boat horn blares]

16:49.883 --> 16:51.593
-Shh.
-[man] ...found.

16:51.677 --> 16:53.929
Then give three tugs on the rope.
All right.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.097
Get back up, son.

16:56.598 --> 16:57.641
-[ship thuds]
-[Sarah gasps]

16:58.434 --> 16:59.351
Okay.

17:00.519 --> 17:02.980
[sighs] We're moving.

17:04.064 --> 17:04.982
Ye-- yeah.

17:11.697 --> 17:13.615
I'm so glad that they're still doing this.

17:14.158 --> 17:16.368
-Keep calm. Carry on.
-[announcer] <i>Welcome</i>

17:16.452 --> 17:18.787
-<i>to the summer movie series.</i>
<i>-</i>[Kie] Back to OBX life.

17:18.871 --> 17:21.331
You know? Aren't you glad I made you come?

17:21.915 --> 17:23.584
Ecstatic. [clears throat]

17:23.667 --> 17:25.377
My couch was pretty comfy, I'll be honest.

17:26.420 --> 17:27.880
We're out of the green zone, man.

17:27.963 --> 17:31.008
-Dude, <i>tranquilo,</i> okay?
-We're in the middle of Kooklandia.

17:31.091 --> 17:33.260
-This is the last place I wanted to be.
<i>-</i>Shut up, Pope.

17:34.928 --> 17:38.057
Hey, uh... can I get two Pepsis, please?

17:38.140 --> 17:39.516
-[vendor] Sure.
-[Rafe] Hey, Kie.

17:40.184 --> 17:41.185
Hey, what's up?

17:42.895 --> 17:44.021
How are you?

17:45.064 --> 17:47.649
-I'm fine.
-Good, good. Um...

17:48.734 --> 17:51.820
Tell your boy that we know what he did.

17:54.031 --> 17:56.575
Sorry, what boy are you talking about?

17:56.658 --> 17:57.493
Uh, he'll know.

18:00.496 --> 18:01.330
Bye.

18:01.997 --> 18:02.873
[Kie] Douche.

18:07.044 --> 18:10.255
Just saw Rafe, and he said, and I quote,

18:10.339 --> 18:12.591
"Tell your boy that we know what he did."

18:12.674 --> 18:13.801
-What is that?
-[JJ] Um...

18:14.635 --> 18:16.428
-Where is he?
-Right there.

18:18.639 --> 18:21.100
-Great, the whole death squad. Ah!
-[JJ] Don't stare, bro.

18:21.725 --> 18:22.935
Just warning you, bro.

18:23.477 --> 18:25.437
If they corner me,
I'm coming out swinging, okay?

18:25.521 --> 18:27.815
-Slice and dicin'. I'm on edge right now.
-Yeah, yeah.

18:27.898 --> 18:30.025
If that doesn't work,
I got this right here.

18:30.109 --> 18:32.277
Yeah, yeah.
So, we just gotta stay in the group.

18:32.361 --> 18:34.488
-They can't get us in the group.
-Like a school of fish.

18:34.571 --> 18:36.281
Stay in the school.
Can't leave the school.

18:36.365 --> 18:37.908
-[Kie] I'm sorry, JJ...
-Stay in school.

18:37.991 --> 18:41.703
Please tell me
that you did not bring a gun here.

18:41.787 --> 18:42.871
-JJ, there are kids.
-No!

18:42.955 --> 18:45.124
Kie, I didn't bring the gun.
Everything's fine, okay?

18:45.207 --> 18:47.709
Wow, thank you. That's really convincing.
I love that, JJ.

18:47.793 --> 18:49.670
[announcer]
<i>Welcome to the summer movie series...</i>

18:50.212 --> 18:53.132
Founding principle, you guys.
No secrets amongst Pogues.

18:53.215 --> 18:54.842
What is Rafe talking about?

18:54.925 --> 18:58.887
-[announcer] <i>All proceeds...</i>
<i>-</i>Kie, it might go down tonight.

19:00.722 --> 19:01.723
What does that mean?

19:02.349 --> 19:04.685
"Might go down tonight."
What did y'all do?

19:05.561 --> 19:07.354
[JJ] Deny, deny, deny.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.358
[grunts]

19:15.737 --> 19:16.822
[Sarah] Oh, my God.

19:17.489 --> 19:18.657
[John B sighs]

19:18.740 --> 19:21.285
-What is the hottest you've ever been?
-Right now.

19:22.202 --> 19:23.036
Same.

19:24.705 --> 19:27.875
Do you... I don't know,
do you wanna play a game?

19:27.958 --> 19:29.710
-No, I don't.
-Cool.

19:29.793 --> 19:33.338
So, there's this game
my sister and I play.

19:34.131 --> 19:37.134
It's called truth or dare,
except there's no dare.

19:37.217 --> 19:39.303
So, it's just truth, Sarah. That's truth.

19:40.721 --> 19:41.555
Yeah.

19:43.557 --> 19:44.892
Do you wanna play truth?

19:46.852 --> 19:47.728
Sure.

19:48.478 --> 19:49.313
Okay.

19:50.439 --> 19:51.440
Mm.

19:51.523 --> 19:52.816
You get first question.

19:52.900 --> 19:54.651
[in Russian accent]
Why did you kill Dimitri?

19:55.402 --> 19:59.114
[in Russian accent] Oh, that is too easy.
Dimitri, he-- he knew too much.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.325
He was compromised. [chuckles]

20:01.783 --> 20:04.328
Yes, you know,
we all know too much, eventually.

20:04.411 --> 20:05.579
-Ah.
-[John B chuckles]

20:06.288 --> 20:07.164
My turn.

20:07.247 --> 20:08.540
[John B] Mm-hm?

20:08.624 --> 20:10.417
What did you see in the painting?

20:10.918 --> 20:12.002
[sighs]

20:12.085 --> 20:15.005
Look, I can't tell you. Okay?

20:15.422 --> 20:17.299
-Why?
-Because it's for your own safety.

20:17.382 --> 20:19.843
But something made you want to go
to the archives, obviously.

20:19.927 --> 20:22.429
Look, somebody who was supposed
to be dead wasn't, all right?

20:23.764 --> 20:24.806
Like your dad?

20:26.058 --> 20:27.684
Yeah. Okay. You know what?

20:28.101 --> 20:29.978
-I'm sorry.
-No, it's fine.

20:30.062 --> 20:31.897
-Just--
-No, it's not. I am such an idiot.

20:31.980 --> 20:33.690
That was a really lame thing to say.

20:33.774 --> 20:35.025
[sighs]

20:36.652 --> 20:38.320
I can't imagine losing my dad.

20:39.947 --> 20:43.075
[sighs] My entire family would fall apart
without him.

20:44.034 --> 20:48.038
Everybody thinks
he's this really rich guy,

20:49.039 --> 20:51.750
but he's from the cut, like you,

20:52.167 --> 20:55.254
and he's busted his ass
for everything that we have.

20:55.963 --> 20:57.089
You appreciate him.

20:58.340 --> 20:59.216
Yeah.

20:59.800 --> 21:00.676
I do.

21:03.053 --> 21:05.639
[sighs] That's how I feel about my dad.

21:06.807 --> 21:08.225
Is that what this is about?

21:10.852 --> 21:15.107
Okay, so, you know how whales
make those deep noises?

21:16.358 --> 21:19.653
It's like a... [moans]

21:21.697 --> 21:22.572
Yeah?

21:23.031 --> 21:24.116
-That's how...
-[chuckles]

21:24.199 --> 21:26.368
...other whales
hear each other across the ocean,

21:26.451 --> 21:30.956
and I know
this sounds really weird, but, uh...

21:35.836 --> 21:38.005
I can hear him calling to me...

21:43.635 --> 21:45.012
like he needs my help.

21:50.892 --> 21:54.771
But, uh, I-- I cannot let feelings
interfere with the mission.

21:54.855 --> 21:56.648
[in Russian accent] No. No, comrade.

21:56.732 --> 21:58.650
-Mm.
-Definitely not.

21:58.734 --> 21:59.568
Mmm.

22:06.825 --> 22:10.412
Look, I hear hooves,
I usually think horses, not zebras.

22:10.495 --> 22:12.998
Two tourists fall off their boat
in the high seas,

22:13.081 --> 22:14.750
drown, and the sharks took 'em.

22:14.833 --> 22:16.460
Yeah. Yeah. I get it. But...

22:17.294 --> 22:18.462
this is kinda weird.

22:18.545 --> 22:21.590
First, there's too much water
in the lungs,

22:21.673 --> 22:25.385
and that tells me that they were dead
before they hit the water, not after.

22:25.844 --> 22:26.803
Then, there's this.

22:27.471 --> 22:31.224
Same type of wounds on both corpses.

22:31.308 --> 22:33.310
Now, at first, I thought it was a bite,
but it's not.

22:33.393 --> 22:36.063
There's a round curve on the inside.

22:36.146 --> 22:38.815
I think it's defensive wounds
from a gaff hook.

22:38.899 --> 22:41.109
-Gaff hook?
-Yeah. That thing you spear a fish with--

22:41.193 --> 22:42.819
Charlie, I know what a gaff hook is.

22:42.903 --> 22:44.237
All right, all right.

22:44.321 --> 22:48.325
My take is that whoever did this
was trying to destroy evidence.

22:48.408 --> 22:50.077
They gaffed 'em,
they rolled 'em overboard

22:50.160 --> 22:52.204
and let the sharks do the rest.

22:58.877 --> 23:00.545
[Sarah] Okay, go, go, go, go!

23:00.921 --> 23:02.631
-[man shouting in Chinese]
-[John B] Come on.

23:02.714 --> 23:04.800
[continues shouting in Chinese]

23:08.011 --> 23:08.970
[Sarah] Excuse me!

23:09.679 --> 23:11.181
-Comin' in hot!
-Sorry!

23:11.681 --> 23:13.725
-Sorry. [sighs]
-[laughing]

23:15.644 --> 23:17.396
-[John B] Here's your shoe.
-Thanks.

23:17.813 --> 23:19.523
Whew! Whew.

23:20.232 --> 23:21.233
Oh, my God.

23:21.858 --> 23:23.735
-We're disgusting.
-[John B] What?

23:23.819 --> 23:25.904
We will not get into the archives
looking like this.

23:25.987 --> 23:26.947
Why not?

23:27.030 --> 23:30.826
I promise you, they will not let us in
looking like we crawled out of a swamp.

23:31.284 --> 23:32.202
Okay, fine.

23:33.370 --> 23:35.455

23:38.959 --> 23:40.127
<i>âª To you âª</i>

23:40.210 --> 23:42.838
[Sarah] What about this store?
Let's go shopping here.

23:42.921 --> 23:44.381
[John B] Absolutely not.

23:45.382 --> 23:48.051
[Sarah] Whoa, Sancho.
I think we've arrived.

23:50.178 --> 23:52.389
Sarah, I don't think you understand.
This is like an organ

23:52.472 --> 23:54.182
with the wrong blood type.
It doesn't work.

23:54.266 --> 23:56.435
You are the single most dramatic person
I've ever met.

23:56.518 --> 23:58.979
-[John B] No, I'm not.
-What about cashmere?

23:59.062 --> 24:00.772
Oh, my God. Have you seen this shirt?

24:00.856 --> 24:02.774
-Yeah.
-It's $190!

24:02.858 --> 24:04.651
Yeah, don't worry. I'll sugar mama you.

24:05.402 --> 24:07.904
-Sugar mama?
-What about some glasses?

24:08.572 --> 24:09.906
Little Clark Kent action.

24:10.323 --> 24:12.451
You don't understand.
I don't want anything from here.

24:12.534 --> 24:13.702
-John B?
-[clerk] Can I help?

24:13.785 --> 24:15.954
[Sarah] Yes. Yes, you may, Mr...

24:16.037 --> 24:17.789
-Mr. Ike.
-Ike? Sarah.

24:17.873 --> 24:18.790
-Jonathan.
-John.

24:18.874 --> 24:22.502
My friend Jonathan here
needs all the help he can get.

24:23.295 --> 24:24.504
-I can see that.
-[Sarah] Yeah.

24:27.132 --> 24:30.719
Aww! You look like you're ready
for the middle school dance.

24:30.802 --> 24:33.138
I look like I got kicked out
of the barbershop quartet.

24:33.221 --> 24:35.557
Mr. Ike, what about seersucker?

24:35.640 --> 24:37.434
-I'm not wearing seersucker.
-Excellent choice.

24:37.517 --> 24:40.270
And maybe a pink button-down, some bucks?

24:40.353 --> 24:41.521
Bucks? What's a buck?

24:41.980 --> 24:42.814
I'll get a pair.

24:43.565 --> 24:44.774
Shh.

24:44.858 --> 24:46.318
Just accept your fate.

24:46.902 --> 24:47.777
[knocking]

24:48.236 --> 24:49.988
-[John B] Nope, not comin' out.
-Why not?

24:50.071 --> 24:52.157
[John B]
Because you're probably gonna buy it

24:52.240 --> 24:54.493
-or something?
-Yeah, well, you're not wrong.

24:54.743 --> 24:57.329
-Are you checking yourself out?
-[John B] No, I'm not!

24:57.954 --> 24:59.915
-Stop.
-[Sarah] Relax, John B.

24:59.998 --> 25:02.042
Not like I've never seen a boy
in underwear before.

25:03.460 --> 25:06.546
I have a brother.
Get your head out of the gutter, John B.

25:06.630 --> 25:07.464
Yeah.

25:09.841 --> 25:11.176
Snazzy.

25:11.968 --> 25:12.886
Oh, man.

25:12.969 --> 25:14.679
-Pull your fly up.
-Got it.

25:15.514 --> 25:18.767
-Honestly, if somebody saw me in this--
-[Sarah] They'd roast the shit out of you.

25:18.850 --> 25:19.726
Yeah.

25:19.809 --> 25:21.811
[Sarah] It's a good thing
we're on a secret mission,

25:21.895 --> 25:24.481
so we have to assume another identity.

25:24.898 --> 25:27.317
In fact, we probably shouldn't
even be using our real names.

25:27.400 --> 25:29.277
Yeah, so we need aliases.
What are you thinkin'?

25:30.237 --> 25:31.404
Mmm...

25:31.488 --> 25:33.615
Vlad... from...

25:34.199 --> 25:35.033
Vienna.

25:35.450 --> 25:36.576
What's mine?

25:36.660 --> 25:40.080
Okay. Uh, Valerie from Quebec.

[John B] No.<i> </i>No, that's it.

25:47.003 --> 25:49.714
So, since you got to dress me,
I'm feeling all spiffy.

25:51.132 --> 25:53.009
-I get to dress you.
<i>-</i>Bring it.

25:54.219 --> 25:55.845
Wow. It looks great.

25:56.638 --> 25:58.390
It's like a soccer mom's first outing.

26:00.016 --> 26:01.309
How do I put this on?

26:01.393 --> 26:02.978
Is that a lavender or plum?

26:05.939 --> 26:07.023
No.

26:07.107 --> 26:09.651
This dress comes with built-in nunchucks.

26:11.987 --> 26:12.821
[John B] Aah.

26:13.488 --> 26:14.322
No.

Cl-- I mean, you-- you clean up nice, Val.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.753
You have a way with words, Vlad.

26:29.421 --> 26:30.505
Um...

26:30.589 --> 26:32.966
[clears throat] So, do we have a winner?

26:33.049 --> 26:34.467
I think we have a winner.

26:35.385 --> 26:36.428
Yeah, I think so.

26:36.511 --> 26:38.054
-Yeah.
-[chuckles]

26:38.471 --> 26:40.015
[John B]Â  Can I ask you something?

26:41.600 --> 26:42.726
Why did you come?

26:43.435 --> 26:45.645
-To finish the mission.
-No, for real.

26:49.816 --> 26:50.900
Because...

26:52.235 --> 26:54.821
[sighs] ...I am 16,

26:54.904 --> 26:57.657
and I already know what
the rest of my life is gonna look like.

26:58.366 --> 27:02.537
It's gonna be... stupid yacht clubs
filled with hollow people

27:02.621 --> 27:04.372
making useless small talk,

27:04.456 --> 27:08.752
and I feel like if I don't get out
of the Bubble Wrap now, I never will.

27:09.669 --> 27:12.797
And then, by the time I'm 30,
I'm going to be an alcoholic,

27:12.881 --> 27:14.507
and I won't even notice it.

27:15.175 --> 27:17.886
Well, I'd kind of like
some of that Bubble Wrap.

27:19.387 --> 27:20.847
Be careful what you wish for.

27:25.935 --> 27:27.395
-[John B clears throat]
-Um...

27:28.355 --> 27:31.358
Best to keep it professional.
We've got a job to do. Come on.

Archives. Now.

27:34.653 --> 27:37.989

Gotta take a piss.

27:46.539 --> 27:47.415
Hold it.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.834
I can't hold it. I drank too much soda.

of the student center.

-Have you ever been here before?
-I've never been to a college, no.

31:20.920 --> 31:22.380
That's a gap in your training.

How do you like it?

31:24.799 --> 31:25.758
So far, so good.

So, my dad went here.

31:28.344 --> 31:30.054
-Uh-huh.
-And then his dad went here,

31:30.138 --> 31:31.973
and then his dad's dad went here.

31:32.056 --> 31:33.558
That's pretty rough.

31:33.641 --> 31:36.686
Yeah, I know. He would have
an absolute aneurysm if I didn't go here,

31:36.769 --> 31:39.689

but what can you do?

31:49.782 --> 31:51.326
I was spending the night at Scarlet's.

31:51.409 --> 31:54.454
And what would he think
if he knew you were with me?

31:54.537 --> 31:56.372
I'd be hanged for treason.

31:56.456 --> 31:58.207
-[gasps] As a Pogue sympathizer?
-[Sarah] Mm.

31:58.291 --> 31:59.876
[gasps] Oh, my goodness.

32:00.376 --> 32:02.795
You've gotta be careful
fraternizing with the enemy, Valerie.

32:02.879 --> 32:05.214
Wait a minute. Did he kidnap you?
Or drug you?

32:05.298 --> 32:09.969
[in French accent] No, I came
of my own recognizance, following a lead.

32:10.053 --> 32:11.763
Ohh. Do we know this enemy?

32:11.846 --> 32:12.805
You do.

32:13.348 --> 32:15.016
He used to work for you.

32:15.099 --> 32:17.602
No, no, no.
It's not the scuba thief, is it?

32:18.019 --> 32:19.562
He is not what you think.

32:19.646 --> 32:22.815
Goodness gracious, he's working
some good psyops on you, Val.

32:23.983 --> 32:25.276
He's a smooth operator.

32:26.319 --> 32:27.445
No, he's not.

32:27.862 --> 32:29.030
-Uh--
-[giggling]

32:29.113 --> 32:30.073
Huh.

32:31.950 --> 32:33.326
He's really clumsy.

32:33.785 --> 32:35.870
He does finger guns way too often.

32:35.954 --> 32:37.080
[blows]

32:38.331 --> 32:43.461
And he has absolutely no idea
when to make a move.

32:45.630 --> 32:49.342
But I think I might be able
to turn this one, sir.

32:49.425 --> 32:51.886
You'd better be careful, Valerie.

32:51.970 --> 32:53.763
Once a Pogue, always a Pogue.

32:56.432 --> 32:59.602
All right, Vlad,
it's time to play the truth game.

32:59.686 --> 33:01.854
-Again?
-Why the hell are we here?

33:02.647 --> 33:05.108
Look, Sarah, I already told you.
I can't tell you.

33:05.191 --> 33:07.986
Okay, well, intel on the mission
is the price of the ticket,

33:08.069 --> 33:10.029
and I'm the only way you're getting in.

33:10.113 --> 33:11.155
It's your choice.

33:11.781 --> 33:14.075
-I have to know.
-Okay.

33:16.119 --> 33:17.829
[sighs] On pain of death?

33:18.246 --> 33:19.330
Mm-hm.

33:22.208 --> 33:23.376
I'm on a treasure hunt.

33:25.712 --> 33:27.088
[laughs]

33:27.714 --> 33:28.673
What?

33:31.843 --> 33:33.302
Oh, shit, you're serious.

33:33.845 --> 33:35.888
Look, I have reason to believe
that Denmark Tanny

33:35.972 --> 33:37.890
was the sole survivor
of the Royal Merchant wreck.

33:38.975 --> 33:40.810
Look, I-- I know this sounds crazy, okay,

33:40.893 --> 33:43.354
but I'm pretty sure he got away
with 400 million in gold,

33:43.438 --> 33:45.940
which is how he would have been able
to buy Tannyhill.

33:46.733 --> 33:49.652
And I think the location of that treasure
is in his papers.

33:51.195 --> 33:52.405
That's why we're here.

33:53.740 --> 33:55.450
You said 400 million?

33:55.533 --> 33:56.784
That's a lot of Bubble Wrap.

33:57.994 --> 33:59.579
I'll talk to the librarian.

34:00.496 --> 34:01.998
That's a fantastic idea.

34:04.292 --> 34:06.127
I can't tell you how grateful we are

34:06.210 --> 34:08.629
to receive the Tanny materials
from your father.

34:08.713 --> 34:10.339
-Of course.
-It's right up there.

34:10.423 --> 34:11.424
Thank you.

34:12.884 --> 34:14.260
-Thank you.
-Mm-hm.

34:14.343 --> 34:15.303
Yeah.

34:17.305 --> 34:20.099
-[Sarah] All right.
-[sighs] Down the rabbit hole.

34:20.183 --> 34:21.184
Here we go.

34:29.150 --> 34:34.197
It says that Denmark used the money
he made from Tannyhill to buy slaves

34:34.280 --> 34:36.324
and give them their freedom.

34:36.741 --> 34:40.703
It says
that he was accused of inciting revolt.

34:40.787 --> 34:42.497
This is before the Civil War.

34:42.914 --> 34:44.207
That's why they hanged him.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.168
Let me see this.

34:47.251 --> 34:48.377
[Sarah] That's the Bible.

34:50.254 --> 34:51.297
Check this out.

34:51.714 --> 34:54.050
-[Sarah] These are the birthdays.
-Yeah, Denmark Tanny.

34:54.592 --> 34:58.387
[Sarah] Cecilia, Robert, Lewis,
and Abraham. His three sons.

34:58.888 --> 35:01.724
Yeah. Wait a minute.

35:03.392 --> 35:05.186
-[Sarah] Is that a picture of--
-[John B] Gold.

35:05.269 --> 35:08.106
This is how he bought the land.
It's-- it's British gold.

35:09.273 --> 35:10.942
This is what was on the Merchant.

35:11.901 --> 35:12.902
[chuckles]

35:12.985 --> 35:14.028
[Sarah] Bingo.

35:15.655 --> 35:18.324
This is what we found
when we first moved in.

35:20.493 --> 35:21.452
Wait, what's that?

35:22.578 --> 35:26.624
[Sarah] This is the last correspondence.

35:26.707 --> 35:31.087
Wait, that's-- that's in Gullah,
the lost Creole language.

35:31.504 --> 35:32.672
Can you read it?

35:33.381 --> 35:34.590
No. Mm-mm.

35:35.007 --> 35:36.676
I wish, but no.

35:36.759 --> 35:40.388
So, Denmark finds out
that the posse's coming for him.

35:41.305 --> 35:42.723
Wait, what's the date on the letter?

35:43.224 --> 35:47.061
It is... May 3rd, 1844.

35:47.979 --> 35:49.272
Wait, that's--

35:49.355 --> 35:50.690
That's the day he died.

35:52.650 --> 35:54.443
And this is addressed to Robert.

35:55.236 --> 35:58.865
So on the day he dies,
he writes a letter to his son?

35:58.948 --> 36:00.950
In a language only they can understand.

36:03.619 --> 36:04.453
Wait a minute.

36:05.288 --> 36:06.330
What?

36:07.582 --> 36:08.749
[whispers] Let's see...

36:18.467 --> 36:20.469
[seabirds calling]

36:21.512 --> 36:22.680
[deputy] We got lucky.

36:22.763 --> 36:25.266
There's a camera on a solar panel.

36:26.142 --> 36:30.188
We can't make out a face,
but we were able to ID the other boat.

36:30.271 --> 36:31.981
-[scoffs]
-[Dr. Thornton] Whose boat is it?

36:32.064 --> 36:33.566
Registered to Heyward.

36:34.400 --> 36:35.902
We think this is his kid.

36:35.985 --> 36:39.363
[Topper] All right, so she thought
that I did this, Deputy, right?

36:39.447 --> 36:41.407
I told you, Mom,
not everything's my fault.

36:41.490 --> 36:43.618
Can we talk about this privately, please?

36:45.286 --> 36:46.621
So, what happens now?

36:46.704 --> 36:48.748
Well, if you press charges,

36:49.290 --> 36:50.875
it'll be up to juvenile court.

36:51.334 --> 36:54.128
Now, Pope is 16.
Could be tried as an adult.

36:54.795 --> 36:55.713
He'd do time.

36:58.090 --> 36:59.592
[Dr. Thornton] Press charges.

37:01.344 --> 37:04.597
-You know, Heyward, uh...
-Deputy, I said press charges.

37:05.848 --> 37:07.225
Yeah, all right. We're on it.

37:12.605 --> 37:14.523
[boat horn blares]

37:14.607 --> 37:17.443
[Sarah] My dad is going to kill me
for being out all night,

37:17.526 --> 37:19.695
but at least we completed the mission.

37:19.779 --> 37:20.780
[John B] Yeah. Yeah.

37:22.156 --> 37:25.826
You know, speaking of the mission,
you're not as bad as I thought you'd be.

37:25.910 --> 37:29.997
-[Sarah laughs] Well, what'd you expect?
-[John B] Do you want me to answer that?

37:30.331 --> 37:33.334
I have an idea.
Maybe a Kook princess?

37:34.502 --> 37:35.878
Bubble Wrap queen?

37:35.962 --> 37:37.713
-Somethin' like that.
-[laughs]

37:37.797 --> 37:39.715
Rude to waiters at a minimum,
type of thing.

37:39.799 --> 37:42.426
Ow! That hurts.

37:42.510 --> 37:44.136
-Yikes.
-Just sayin'.

37:45.096 --> 37:46.430
You're not what I expected either.

37:48.099 --> 37:49.267
Much weirder.

37:49.976 --> 37:52.311
For starters, you are totally ADD.

37:52.770 --> 37:55.106
Uh... ooh... Yeah.

37:55.189 --> 37:56.023
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

37:56.649 --> 38:01.904
And I thought you were
this really laid-back, surfer, dude-bro.

38:01.988 --> 38:02.863
[John B] Mm?

38:02.947 --> 38:06.284
And it turns out
you are on a paternal jihad.

38:07.076 --> 38:09.620
Yeah, I'm just trying
to get this letter translated.

38:12.540 --> 38:13.416
Hey...

38:15.167 --> 38:16.335
To breaking expectations.

38:16.419 --> 38:18.170
<i>-Salud.</i>
<i>-Salud.</i>

38:24.051 --> 38:25.052
So...

38:26.512 --> 38:28.681
what's it gonna be like when we get back?

38:31.684 --> 38:32.643
With what?

38:34.812 --> 38:35.646
Well...

38:36.647 --> 38:38.399
you know, like, um...

38:40.234 --> 38:41.944
-This?
-Yeah.

38:46.073 --> 38:49.201
Nothing changes, I guess?

38:51.537 --> 38:52.413
Right?

38:55.124 --> 38:56.959
I'll go back to the bubble.

38:57.501 --> 39:01.005
Like, Topper back to the bubble?

39:03.966 --> 39:04.884
Yeah.

39:06.385 --> 39:10.598
And, um...
I guess you'll go back to being a...

39:11.891 --> 39:13.017
a fugitive.

39:15.811 --> 39:16.896
Yeah.

39:20.524 --> 39:22.109
Had a really great day, though.

39:23.778 --> 39:24.737
Me too.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.827
[JJ] Don't let it get in your head.
Three of them and two of us.

39:31.911 --> 39:34.246
-That's typical Kook shit right there.
-[Kie] Hell, yeah.

39:34.330 --> 39:36.332
[JJ] What was your thought process,
using your head?

39:36.749 --> 39:39.585
I don't know, man.
I just kind of acted off instinct.

39:39.668 --> 39:41.087
-Yes.
-I was a cornered animal.

39:41.170 --> 39:44.090
[Heyward] Hey, Pope,
someone here to see you.

39:44.173 --> 39:46.384
[radio chatter]

39:46.926 --> 39:47.802
Evening, Officer.

39:47.885 --> 39:50.554
I have an arrest warrant
for felony destruction of property.

39:50.638 --> 39:53.057
-[Heyward] What?
-[deputy] Hands where I can see 'em.

39:53.140 --> 39:55.810
-Young lady, out of my way.
-[Heyward] Whoa. Shoupe, what'd he do?

39:55.893 --> 39:57.853
-Look at the warrant.
-You're arresting him?

39:57.937 --> 39:59.438
You're just arresting my boy?

39:59.522 --> 40:01.774
-[Kie] Be careful!
-[Heyward] Shoupe, are you listening?

40:01.857 --> 40:03.859
[Shoupe] ...you say can
and will be held against you

40:03.943 --> 40:04.985
in the court of law.

40:05.069 --> 40:08.197
-You have the right to an attorney.
-How much did they pay you, man?

40:08.280 --> 40:10.574
[voices fade]

40:27.258 --> 40:28.384
[JJ] It wasn't him!

40:30.136 --> 40:31.095
It was me.

40:33.681 --> 40:34.974
He tried to talk me out of it,

40:35.766 --> 40:38.060
but I was mad
because he'd just been beaten up.

40:38.144 --> 40:41.230
I was so sick of those assholes
from Figure Eight that I lost my shit.

40:44.442 --> 40:46.402
I can't let you take the blame
for somethin' I did.

40:47.069 --> 40:48.446
You've got too much to lose.

40:48.529 --> 40:50.906
-JJ, what are you doing?
-I'm tellin' the truth.

40:52.074 --> 40:54.994
For once in my goddamn life,
I'm gonna tell the truth.

40:57.580 --> 40:59.582
-I took his old man's boat, too.
-What the hell?

40:59.665 --> 41:01.834
-JJ, come on.
-Just shut up, Pope!

41:02.626 --> 41:03.586
Just shut up.

41:05.713 --> 41:06.714
He's a good kid.

41:08.090 --> 41:09.300
You know where I'm from.

41:09.800 --> 41:10.676
Yeah.

41:12.803 --> 41:13.721
This was all me.

41:14.305 --> 41:15.389
[sighs]

41:18.058 --> 41:19.059
That's the whole truth?

41:20.853 --> 41:22.104
Whole truth, swear to God.

41:22.188 --> 41:24.023
I know what you think, damn it,
I'm asking Pope.

41:32.114 --> 41:33.491
Yeah, that about covers it.

41:36.076 --> 41:37.828
[handcuffs rattle]

41:40.414 --> 41:41.999
[car door slams]

41:48.506 --> 41:50.132
-[Heyward] Pope...
-[Pope] Shit!

41:50.216 --> 41:51.050
[Heyward] Pope?

41:52.468 --> 41:53.385
Pope!

42:00.059 --> 42:01.435
[handcuffs rattle]

42:03.354 --> 42:04.688
[Shoupe] In there, tough guy.

42:11.237 --> 42:13.197
-[door slams]
-[lock clicks]

42:38.847 --> 42:40.849
-[Sarah] Okay, so...
-[John B] Yes?

42:41.559 --> 42:44.728
[Sarah] Now that we have returned
to the motherland...

42:44.812 --> 42:45.646
[John B] Mm.

42:45.729 --> 42:47.815
...we must revert to our real
identities,

42:48.482 --> 42:49.775
so if you see me on the street--

42:49.858 --> 42:53.654
[in Russian accent] Yes, of course,
I am a true, uh, professional.

42:56.615 --> 42:57.741
[thunder rumbles]

42:57.825 --> 42:59.827
It's been a pleasure
working with you, comrade.

43:01.954 --> 43:02.955
Pleasure's mine.

43:10.129 --> 43:12.339
Wait, wait, wait! Uh... Wh--

43:13.716 --> 43:14.633
Really?

43:15.467 --> 43:16.635
[chuckles] That's it?

43:17.261 --> 43:20.222
You're just gonna walk away
like this never happened?

43:21.181 --> 43:23.017
Well, that's what professionals do, right?

43:23.100 --> 43:25.227
Sarah, I just had the best day of my life!

43:26.270 --> 43:30.024
-John B, you're gonna blow our cover.
-Look, I don't care about my cover, Sarah.

43:30.107 --> 43:34.111
I don't care if my friends find out
or your boyfriend with his frosted tips.

43:34.194 --> 43:36.614
Look, yesterday,
I-- I didn't even know who you were.

43:38.616 --> 43:39.992
And today, I'm, like...

43:42.369 --> 43:43.287
Sarah Cameron.

43:45.122 --> 43:47.583
And honestly,
in my limited experience, that's rare.

43:47.666 --> 43:50.002
That's like, like... eclipse rare.

43:50.085 --> 43:52.796
Like a blind person seeing color
for the first time rare

43:52.880 --> 43:55.716
or, like, Bigfoot evidence
or the northern lights.

43:55.799 --> 43:58.510
Look, I can't pretend
like this isn't real,

43:59.428 --> 44:01.013
like this didn't happen.

44:01.096 --> 44:02.306
-I'm sorry, I--
-Shut up.

44:02.389 --> 44:04.391
["The WAND" playing]

44:09.813 --> 44:11.440
I can't pretend either.

44:16.654 --> 44:18.405
[man] Hey, man, get a room.

44:20.157 --> 44:22.201
[both chuckle]

44:27.956 --> 44:30.626
-Um...
-[thunder rumbling]

44:30.709 --> 44:33.837
It's a... it's a small island.

44:33.921 --> 44:34.922
[John B] Mm-hm?

44:35.005 --> 44:35.923
[clears throat]
