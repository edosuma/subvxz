WEBVTT

00:08.442 --> 00:09.675
Man:<i> Gin.</i>

00:09.677 --> 00:13.579
Oh, come on. Again?
Hey, I'm that good.

00:13.581 --> 00:15.781
You know, I think
Sam's cheating at cards again.
Woman: Four hands

00:15.783 --> 00:18.751
in a row? No one is that good.
Sam: You don't
have to throw the cards.

00:18.753 --> 00:20.786
Woman: Just deal.
Man: All right.

00:20.788 --> 00:22.554
Yeah.

00:22.556 --> 00:25.657
Well, do you think
we should tell Meredith?
Nah.

00:25.659 --> 00:27.459
(Indistinct conversation
over speakers)

00:27.461 --> 00:30.496
Red team, 20 minutes
till dive one, 20 minutes.

00:30.498 --> 00:31.463
(Divers sighing, groaning)

00:31.465 --> 00:32.664
Meredith:
Let's finish this.

00:32.666 --> 00:34.733
Sam: Hey, you want to
move five in a row...

00:34.735 --> 00:36.635
(Conversation distorts,
heartbeat thumps)

00:36.637 --> 00:37.803
Yo, what the hell
you doing, man?

00:40.307 --> 00:43.142
He-man, you all right?

00:43.144 --> 00:44.610
Yo! Bro...
Dude.

00:44.612 --> 00:45.411
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:45.413 --> 00:46.512
Holy...

00:46.513 --> 00:47.612
I need to get out of here

00:47.615 --> 00:48.680
right now!
Whoa!
Come on...

00:48.682 --> 00:50.616
De la Rosa, stand down.

00:50.618 --> 00:51.817
Mugford: D! Stand down!

00:51.819 --> 00:53.352
Come on, man!
Now, wait, now, wait...!

00:53.354 --> 00:54.420
Mugford: Stand down!

00:54.422 --> 00:55.721
What did you do to me?

00:55.723 --> 00:57.122
Mugford: Stand down!

00:57.124 --> 00:58.791
What the hell did you do?

00:58.793 --> 01:00.659
No...
(Grunting)

01:00.661 --> 01:02.327
(Screaming)

01:02.329 --> 01:03.829
Man (Over speaker):
Oxygen level compromised.

01:03.831 --> 01:05.297
Captain, control room.

01:05.299 --> 01:07.699
We are code five in chamber.
Code five.

01:07.701 --> 01:09.768
Atmosphere alert, sir.

01:09.770 --> 01:11.203
We are out of bounds.

01:11.205 --> 01:13.705
Repeat, out of bounds
on the po-2.

01:13.707 --> 01:15.841
Mark...

01:15.843 --> 01:17.142
Hey! Come on.

01:17.144 --> 01:19.144
Mark: Divers, alternate
air source.

01:19.146 --> 01:20.345
Go to the bibs.

01:20.347 --> 01:22.414
Flushing the chamber in ten,

01:22.416 --> 01:25.084
nine, eight, seven,
Meredith: Get on your bibs!

01:25.086 --> 01:27.519
Six, five,

01:27.521 --> 01:29.588
four, three,

01:29.590 --> 01:31.156
two, one.

01:36.263 --> 01:38.664
What in god's green earth
is going on here?

01:38.666 --> 01:40.432
It's de la Rosa, captain.
Something's wrong.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.267
Real wrong.

01:42.269 --> 01:44.636
It isn't meant to be.

01:44.638 --> 01:47.873
(Indistinct communication
over radio)

01:47.875 --> 01:50.409
Things are
calming down now, sir.

01:52.313 --> 01:53.745
(Alarms stop, computer blips)

01:53.747 --> 01:55.214
Chamber is secure.

01:55.216 --> 01:56.381
Mark:
Po-2 levels in bounds.

01:56.383 --> 01:58.884
Disengage bibs.

01:58.886 --> 01:59.885
Hey, what the hell, d?

01:59.887 --> 02:01.620
You trying to kill us, huh?

02:01.622 --> 02:03.255
(Gasps)
D!

02:03.257 --> 02:04.656
What's wrong with you, man?
You all right? D?

02:05.759 --> 02:07.793
D...!
D...!

02:07.795 --> 02:09.128
Oh...!
Yo!
D!

02:10.264 --> 02:12.431
Hey, hey, come on, man...

02:12.433 --> 02:13.899
¶ ¶

02:55.309 --> 02:56.308
(wry chuckle)

02:56.310 --> 02:57.743
She does this every year.

02:57.745 --> 02:58.944
It's her thing.

02:58.946 --> 03:00.913
The world's most
commercial holiday.

03:00.915 --> 03:03.315
Oh, now, now, mccherub.

03:03.317 --> 03:04.850
You should appreciate
what you have.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.818
We're not all
so lucky.

03:06.820 --> 03:09.555
Sometimes I think
you prefer being alone.

03:11.659 --> 03:14.526
We all have to live
with our decisions, Tim.

03:26.974 --> 03:28.774
Hey, Abby.

03:28.776 --> 03:30.776
Hey, uh...

03:30.778 --> 03:31.910
What you doin'?

03:31.912 --> 03:33.245
Nothin'.

03:34.248 --> 03:35.814
Oh, look!

03:35.816 --> 03:39.418
Looks like you got a gift
from your secret Valentine.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.253
Aw. Thanks, Abbs.

03:41.255 --> 03:42.521
Oh, it's not from me.

03:42.523 --> 03:44.590
But you should
really read that card.

03:44.592 --> 03:46.959
Well, I didn't get you anything.

03:46.961 --> 03:48.860
You still have a few days.

03:49.964 --> 03:51.930
"Roses are red.

03:51.932 --> 03:53.999
"They go in a bucket.
Jake is a jerk.

03:54.001 --> 03:55.367
He can go suck it."

03:56.270 --> 03:58.937
That's sweet. (Chuckles)

03:58.939 --> 04:00.706
Tony: Figured out a
gift for Delilah?
Oh.

04:00.708 --> 04:01.907
I'm working on it.

04:01.909 --> 04:02.874
Tony:
Chocolate, flowers.

04:02.876 --> 04:04.409
McGee:
No, that's a cop-out.

04:04.411 --> 04:05.711
It's got to be
something meaningful.

04:05.713 --> 04:07.379
We live together now,
you know?

04:07.381 --> 04:08.880
It's just...

04:08.882 --> 04:10.349
You can't think
of anything 'cause

04:10.351 --> 04:12.851
it's a worthless
commercial holiday?

04:12.853 --> 04:14.953
I was gonna say I was
feeling pressure, but yeah.

04:14.955 --> 04:16.989
You know what I'd like, just
once? Somebody to come up to me

04:16.991 --> 04:19.791
and say, "happy Valentine's day.
Go to a wizards game."

04:19.793 --> 04:21.526
I agree.

04:21.528 --> 04:24.429
And why is it that guys have
to do all the romantic stuff?

04:27.635 --> 04:28.967
Mm. Don't look at me.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.269
It's not my holiday.

04:30.271 --> 04:32.037
Your people perpetuate it.
Actually,

04:32.039 --> 04:34.539
all I want this year
is to watch a movie at home.

04:34.541 --> 04:36.041
Sorry, Ellie.
Oh.

04:36.043 --> 04:37.909
You had a rou... rough year.

04:37.911 --> 04:38.944
Yeah.
Sorry.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.612
You know, Tim,
it's not so bad.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.714
The only thing
I'm sad about missing

04:42.716 --> 04:44.916
is my annual
Valentine's day meal.

04:44.918 --> 04:48.787
Every year we'd go to gennari's
on Connecticut Avenue. They have

04:48.789 --> 04:50.956
the best salmon piccata
in the world.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.591
You know what?
I think you should still go.

04:52.593 --> 04:54.493
Mm, table for one.
Negative.

04:54.495 --> 04:57.296
Hey, what do you think
i should get Delilah?

04:57.298 --> 05:00.666
Mm... well, you're an author.

05:00.668 --> 05:03.001
Why don't you write her
a romantic poem?

05:03.003 --> 05:05.404
That is a really good idea.
I like it.

05:05.406 --> 05:06.638
I'm gonna do that.
I would like to

05:06.640 --> 05:08.307
read that idea that you write.

05:08.309 --> 05:10.575
Make her dinner.
That's what I used to do.

05:11.745 --> 05:13.312
Well, maybe that
didn't work out so well.

05:13.314 --> 05:14.713
Gear up, McGee.

05:14.715 --> 05:16.982
Got a dead Navy diver
on a ship in the Atlantic.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.984
Helo's waiting.
Bishop:
Uh, what about us, Gibbs?

05:18.986 --> 05:20.585
It's probably
just an accident.

05:20.587 --> 05:22.587
You two stay here.

05:22.589 --> 05:23.588
Happy to!

05:23.590 --> 05:25.590
We'll hold down the sad,

05:25.592 --> 05:28.493
single Valentine's fort,
just the two of us.

05:31.398 --> 05:32.964
<i> (Indistinct radio</i>
<i> communication)</i>

05:32.966 --> 05:34.433
Captain:
<i> Heard you guys were coming.</i>

05:34.435 --> 05:37.002
Don't know why you're here.
We're here because

05:37.004 --> 05:40.372
conn watch supervisor mugford
said the death was suspicious.

05:40.374 --> 05:41.940
Control room guy.
Witnessed it.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.675
Witnessed what,
exactly?

05:43.677 --> 05:46.978
Our dive team leader just
went and lost his damn mind.

05:46.980 --> 05:48.947
He was retired Navy.

05:48.949 --> 05:51.016
Why you were called
to a civilian ship.

05:51.018 --> 05:53.719
Ever been on board a
dive vessel, son?

05:53.721 --> 05:55.020
Uh, you'll be my first,
captain.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.089
Well, I'll be gentle.

05:57.091 --> 05:59.558
State-of-the-art ship
designed to facilitate

05:59.560 --> 06:01.059
deep-sea saturation divers.

06:01.061 --> 06:03.428
We carry things, we
cook for 'em, basically

06:03.430 --> 06:05.497
we babysit 'em while they
work on the ocean floor.

06:05.499 --> 06:06.765
Work?

06:06.767 --> 06:07.999
Welding an
oil pipeline,

06:08.001 --> 06:10.702
622 feet
straight down.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.371
You're the doc.

06:12.373 --> 06:14.072
Medical examiner.
Ah.

06:14.074 --> 06:16.675
Well, you wasted a trip.

06:16.677 --> 06:18.677
Watch your head.

06:18.679 --> 06:21.947
Now, look, agent Gibbs,
we are on a deadline here.

06:21.949 --> 06:23.949
I know you don't care
for the oil company,

06:23.951 --> 06:25.717
but we got a job to do.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.719
You're right.
I don't care.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.057
Show 'em, Sam.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.859
Ducky: Oh, dear.
Sam: You got it, cap'n.

06:33.861 --> 06:34.960
McGee: What's the matter?

06:34.962 --> 06:37.062
Ducky:
It's a decompression chamber.

06:37.064 --> 06:40.732
Captain: That's right.
Pressurized to an atmosphere

06:40.734 --> 06:43.402
more than 19 times
greater than sea level.

06:43.404 --> 06:44.569
McGee:
So opening the hatch would...

06:44.571 --> 06:46.638
Ducky:
Kill them all instantly.

06:46.640 --> 06:47.873
You started decompressing them?

06:47.875 --> 06:49.174
Began about two hours ago.

06:49.176 --> 06:51.476
Well, how much longer
are we talking about?

06:51.478 --> 06:52.711
Four days, minimum.

06:54.648 --> 06:56.648
Then why am I even here?

06:56.650 --> 06:58.150
Captain:
I told you--

06:58.152 --> 07:00.152
you wasted a trip.

07:00.154 --> 07:01.653
Come back in four days.

07:01.655 --> 07:04.156
The process
of decompression

07:04.158 --> 07:06.475
(over speaker):
Will incontrovertibly alter

07:06.476 --> 07:08.793
senior chief de la Rosa's
body chemistry.

07:08.796 --> 07:10.128
In four days,

07:10.130 --> 07:11.129
any evidence that could

07:11.131 --> 07:12.597
tell us how he died--

07:12.599 --> 07:14.800
will be erased forever.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.545
Yo! Yo!
(Meredith screams)

07:26.547 --> 07:28.247
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Meredith: What?

07:28.248 --> 07:29.948
De la Rosa: I need to get
out of here, right now!

07:29.950 --> 07:31.850
Mugford: You can rule out
panic attack.

07:31.852 --> 07:33.952
De la Rosa had 1,000 hours

07:33.954 --> 07:36.988
in pitch-black caves,
zero visibility.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.557
Guy never flinched.

07:38.559 --> 07:41.159
Who's he yelling at?
No one. Everyone.

07:41.161 --> 07:43.628
I watched it a dozen times,
i still can't tell.

07:43.630 --> 07:44.996
That's why I called you.

07:44.998 --> 07:48.467
De la Rosa is former Navy;
Guy's tough as nails.

07:48.469 --> 07:50.168
Something ain't right.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.838
Okay, you see those
sparks right there?

07:52.840 --> 07:54.873
He could have killed
everyone inside.

07:54.875 --> 07:57.776
The atmosphere inside
any decompression chamber

07:57.778 --> 07:59.244
is extremely dry.

07:59.246 --> 08:01.012
Start a fire,
it's all over.

08:01.014 --> 08:02.614
Give me the details
on the chamber.

08:02.616 --> 08:06.084
Pressurized to match
the divers' working conditions,

08:06.086 --> 08:09.955
which, in this case,
is 622 feet below sea level.

08:09.957 --> 08:12.557
Divers live, eat,
sleep in the chamber.

08:12.559 --> 08:14.192
When it's time
to go to work,

08:14.194 --> 08:16.061
they attach to this diving bell,

08:16.063 --> 08:18.530
which takes 'em straight
down to the ocean floor.

08:18.532 --> 08:22.234
They work eight hours,
come back up, eat, sleep,

08:22.236 --> 08:24.569
repeat until the job's done.

08:24.571 --> 08:26.571
Only decompress once,
at the end.

08:26.573 --> 08:27.706
It's more efficient.

08:27.708 --> 08:28.807
Safer, too.

08:29.810 --> 08:31.042
In theory, anyway.

08:38.986 --> 08:41.253
Oh, Jethro, please.
You can't expect me to determine

08:41.255 --> 08:44.289
a cause of death
from a "instant replay."

08:44.291 --> 08:47.526
Come on, duck,
you got to give me something.
All right.

08:47.528 --> 08:51.062
I can confidently
rule out quicksand.

08:52.666 --> 08:53.999
Jalen (Over speaker):
Amen.

08:54.001 --> 08:55.667
Rest in peace, brother.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.070
Hello, everyone.

08:59.072 --> 09:01.072
I know this is a...
A little awkward,

09:01.074 --> 09:03.542
but I have to ask you all
a few questions.

09:03.544 --> 09:05.577
Anyone have any idea
what happened here?

09:05.579 --> 09:06.745
Heart attack?

09:06.747 --> 09:08.847
Stroke, maybe?
Brain aneurysm?

09:08.849 --> 09:10.315
Meredith:
I thought you
Navy investigators

09:10.317 --> 09:12.701
only showed up at crimes.

09:12.702 --> 09:15.086
Well, we're not exactly sure
what happened yet.

09:15.088 --> 09:17.222
McGee:
Senior chief de la Rosa--
was he acting strangely

09:17.224 --> 09:18.990
at all,
before this morning?

09:18.992 --> 09:21.560
No way. The guy was
solid as a rock.

09:21.562 --> 09:23.094
And all four of you
dive together, yes?

09:23.096 --> 09:25.664
Yeah, two by two.
Safety first.

09:25.666 --> 09:28.066
Who was on de la Rosa's team?

09:28.068 --> 09:30.769
Yeah, he was my partner.
So what?

09:32.272 --> 09:33.838
McGee: What's that on the wall
over there?

09:33.840 --> 09:35.707
Air lock, for
food and trash.

09:35.709 --> 09:38.076
Who has access to it?
Sam:
Anyone on board.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.778
Usually just
the kitchen staff uses it.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.246
Meredith:
Hey, agent tough guy.

09:41.248 --> 09:42.747
These two are afraid to ask,

09:42.749 --> 09:44.683
so I will:
When can we move him?

09:44.685 --> 09:46.585
My name is special agent McGee.

09:46.587 --> 09:49.354
And you cannot move him until
the m.E. Examines the body.

09:49.356 --> 09:51.289
Four days from now?

09:51.291 --> 09:52.857
I'm not living in here
with that.

09:52.859 --> 09:54.926
Well, I'm sorry.
Jalen: Now, you realize

09:54.928 --> 09:58.196
there's two ways out
of this chamber, right?

09:58.198 --> 10:01.800
You are not putting the body
in the ocean.
Burial at sea.

10:01.802 --> 10:04.869
We'll say a few words, yeah?
Yeah. We're not just gonna
sit here for 96 hours

10:04.871 --> 10:07.606
while our friend
decomposes.
I understand, okay?

10:07.608 --> 10:09.608
I sympathize,
but you cannot move the body.

10:09.610 --> 10:11.042
You'll be arrested
for interfering

10:11.044 --> 10:12.911
with a federal investigation.

10:12.913 --> 10:14.779
We're already locked up.
At least jail won't smell

10:14.781 --> 10:15.814
like a dead guy.

10:15.816 --> 10:16.881
(Sighs)

10:25.325 --> 10:26.625
Mrs. de la Rosa?

10:26.627 --> 10:28.727
NCIS.

10:29.730 --> 10:32.631
Ma'am...

10:32.633 --> 10:35.266
Are you okay?

10:35.268 --> 10:39.004
I walked out of the house
a few minutes ago.

10:39.006 --> 10:42.107
Don't remember
where I was going.

10:43.710 --> 10:46.978
I'm... so very sorry
for your loss.

10:46.980 --> 10:50.649
I'm special agent
bishop, NCIS.

10:50.651 --> 10:52.417
I have to ask you
a few questions.

10:53.720 --> 10:56.721
Did your husband
take any medication?

10:56.723 --> 10:58.156
No.

10:58.158 --> 11:01.226
He was obsessive
about his health. Why?

11:01.228 --> 11:03.828
We think he may have had
a reaction to something.

11:04.831 --> 11:06.765
I don't understand.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.733
Why is NCIS investigating?

11:08.735 --> 11:10.835
I thought
it was a diving accident.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.203
We're not sure yet.

11:12.205 --> 11:14.205
I need to see him.
Where is he?

11:14.207 --> 11:17.208
Did you recover his body?

11:17.210 --> 11:19.811
He wasn't diving
when he died.

11:19.813 --> 11:22.113
It happened inside
the chamber.

11:24.251 --> 11:26.017
I have to go.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.719
I have to ask you
a few questions...

11:27.721 --> 11:29.721
No, no. I can't deal with
this right now. I'm sorry.

11:29.723 --> 11:32.257
(Door opens, closes)

11:32.259 --> 11:36.094
De la Rosa's rebreather. I mean,
i checked it and rechecked it.

11:36.096 --> 11:37.929
There's no blockages,
no mechanical issues...

11:37.931 --> 11:40.799
That's de la Rosa's actual unit?

11:40.801 --> 11:42.801
They call it
a built-in breathing system.

11:42.803 --> 11:43.968
Bibs, for short.

11:43.970 --> 11:45.804
It delivers the same
trimix gas blend

11:45.806 --> 11:48.473
they breathe
inside the chamber.
What's trimix?

11:48.475 --> 11:50.742
There's too much oxygen
in super-pressurized air,

11:50.744 --> 11:53.812
so they're breathing a blend
of oxygen, nitrogen, and helium.

11:53.814 --> 11:57.348
Could de la Rosa's mix
have been altered?

11:57.350 --> 11:59.818
All the divers breathe
from the same line.

11:59.820 --> 12:02.087
You change one,
you change 'em all.

12:03.857 --> 12:05.857
Okay. Thank you.

12:05.859 --> 12:07.092
Yeah.

12:08.729 --> 12:11.963
Well, based on the...

12:11.965 --> 12:13.732
Evidence and witnesses,

12:13.734 --> 12:15.366
de la Rosa
shouldn't be dead.

12:15.368 --> 12:17.802
Yeah. But he is.

12:17.804 --> 12:19.204
Well, we've got bigger problems.

12:19.206 --> 12:21.039
The divers want
to move the body.

12:21.041 --> 12:23.408
How is ducky gonna perform
the autopsy?

12:25.145 --> 12:26.878
Where is ducky, anyway?

12:26.880 --> 12:28.079
Performing the autopsy.

12:29.416 --> 12:32.217
Oh, hell no.
You want us to do what, now?

12:32.219 --> 12:36.254
As a child, I used to visit
an arcade with my mother.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.256
Yes, I remember
a fabulous game of chance

12:38.258 --> 12:42.260
where I had to pick up
a stuffed toy behind the glass

12:42.262 --> 12:44.062
with a mechanical arm.

12:44.064 --> 12:46.898
I have a feeling
that what we're about to do

12:46.900 --> 12:50.001
is going to be
equally frustrating.

12:50.003 --> 12:51.770
(Scoffs)

12:51.772 --> 12:54.372
Oh, give it to me. Just tell
me where I need to poke.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.474
Go down.
The femoral artery

12:56.476 --> 12:59.177
runs down
the inside of his leg,

12:59.179 --> 13:01.346
from the kneecap
to the groin.

13:01.348 --> 13:03.948
Time out. We can't do this.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.250
You most certainly can.

13:05.252 --> 13:06.818
We're divers, not doctors.

13:06.820 --> 13:07.952
We don't even know
what we're doing.

13:07.954 --> 13:08.987
But I do.

13:08.989 --> 13:10.155
And I can walk you through it,

13:10.157 --> 13:11.523
step by step.

13:11.525 --> 13:13.525
What you're gonna do
is perfectly simple.

13:13.527 --> 13:16.361
Scraping and cutting
his fingernails,

13:16.363 --> 13:18.797
collecting
samples of hair.

13:18.799 --> 13:20.999
Everything you need
is in that bag.

13:21.001 --> 13:24.369
It's a veritable
do-it-yourself kit.

13:24.371 --> 13:25.804
Mr. Washington,

13:25.806 --> 13:28.206
would you take
the other syringe?

13:28.208 --> 13:31.876
You are about to take a sample
of the chief's urine.

13:33.880 --> 13:36.815
Boss, this can't
possibly be legal.
I don't know.

13:36.817 --> 13:39.884
Not sure it's ever
been done before.

13:39.886 --> 13:42.287
Ever done this before?
All the time.

13:42.289 --> 13:45.323
It's called a remote autopsy.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.891
So you ask total novices

13:46.893 --> 13:49.894
to just chop up dead people
all the time, huh?

13:49.896 --> 13:51.963
You're not going
to be chopping up anything.

13:51.965 --> 13:53.932
You're going
to be collecting

13:53.934 --> 13:57.235
trace evidence
and extracting bodily fluids

13:57.237 --> 13:58.970
under my supervision.

13:58.972 --> 14:00.905
(Clears throat)
Ducky: All right, then.

14:00.907 --> 14:03.107
Put a mark midway.

14:04.978 --> 14:06.444
I'm ready.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.546
Boss, what if one of them
is the murderer?

14:08.548 --> 14:11.282
I mean, you've got the killer
collecting evidence on himself.

14:11.284 --> 14:14.285
Or herself.
Meredith: Okay,
let's do this. One,

14:14.287 --> 14:15.620
two...

14:15.622 --> 14:17.155
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

14:17.157 --> 14:18.423
Don't plunge it in

14:18.425 --> 14:19.924
all the way up to the hilt.

14:19.926 --> 14:22.994
Put it in gently,
about two inches.

14:24.631 --> 14:26.431
...three.
Oh, man...

14:26.433 --> 14:27.398
Ducky: Good. Now,

14:27.400 --> 14:29.000
pull back the plunger.

14:31.438 --> 14:32.971
What happened?

14:32.973 --> 14:34.172
You missed.

14:34.174 --> 14:36.307
I put the "x"
exactly where he told me.

14:36.309 --> 14:40.278
Ducky: Human anatomy
is an inexact science.

14:40.280 --> 14:43.248
If you miss again,
don't pull the needle out.

14:43.250 --> 14:46.651
Just poke around, feel around.
You'll find the artery.

14:46.653 --> 14:48.486
Or the artery will find you.

14:49.489 --> 14:50.588
Well, come on.

14:50.590 --> 14:52.123
Get on with it.

14:55.528 --> 14:57.495
Sam: Oh, man... okay...

14:57.497 --> 14:59.030
It's working.

14:59.032 --> 15:00.431
Ducky: Good.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.100
Squirt the blood into the vial

15:02.102 --> 15:04.903
and then discard the needle.
You can send the sample to me

15:04.905 --> 15:06.671
through the airlock.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.074
Congratulations.

15:10.076 --> 15:11.075
Is it over?

15:11.077 --> 15:12.343
Not by a long shot.

15:21.288 --> 15:22.987
(Suppressed retching)

15:22.989 --> 15:24.555
(Computer blips, trills)

15:24.557 --> 15:26.090
Talk to me.

15:26.092 --> 15:30.461
Gibbs, I don't think
Abby's heart cakes are edible.

15:30.463 --> 15:32.163
They're tofu, DiNozzo.

15:32.165 --> 15:33.932
You keep chewing.
Mm.

15:33.934 --> 15:34.999
I don't wanna.

15:36.002 --> 15:37.268
So...

15:37.269 --> 15:38.535
Our friends
in the decompression chamber

15:38.538 --> 15:41.139
each have a secret.

15:41.141 --> 15:42.006
Like what?

15:42.008 --> 15:44.008
Let me show you.

15:44.010 --> 15:44.976
Now, I'm gonna manhandle you

15:44.978 --> 15:46.110
a little bit here.

15:46.112 --> 15:47.979
Oop, I lost you, boss.

15:47.981 --> 15:50.148
Head slap. There you are.

15:51.351 --> 15:52.951
Can you see the screen okay?

15:52.953 --> 15:53.985
Talk.
Copy that.

15:55.355 --> 15:57.255
Sam Harper, 27.

15:57.257 --> 15:58.389
Really bad credit history.

15:58.391 --> 16:00.992
Already lost his house.
Car was repo'd.

16:00.994 --> 16:02.994
Late on alimony. Now, listen,

16:02.996 --> 16:05.029
saturation divers get paid well,

16:05.031 --> 16:07.465
but I don't know
where all this guy's money goes.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.634
McGee's on his way back.
Put him on it.
Will do.

16:09.636 --> 16:12.603
Next up... Meredith ragan.

16:12.605 --> 16:14.973
Former army parachutist.
Tough as nails.

16:14.975 --> 16:17.709
Dishonorably discharged.
Army file is sealed.

16:17.711 --> 16:18.977
So-so unseal it.

16:18.979 --> 16:20.511
(Chuckles)
"Uh..."

16:20.513 --> 16:22.513
Remember Max headroom, Gibbs?

16:22.515 --> 16:23.581
Who-who?

16:23.583 --> 16:25.049
From the '80s. You know...

16:25.051 --> 16:26.751
"Uh-uh-uh...

16:26.753 --> 16:29.354
I, uh... robot head."

16:30.323 --> 16:33.491
Anyway, here is
Jalen Washington, 37.

16:33.493 --> 16:36.060
His cell records show
over 20 calls to

16:36.062 --> 16:38.196
or from a single phone number

16:38.198 --> 16:40.999
during the week leading up
to the<i> brandywine</i> job.
Who owns the phone?

16:41.001 --> 16:43.534
Prepaid burner.
Someone didn't want to be found.

16:43.536 --> 16:45.370
But you're gonna find 'em,
right?

16:45.372 --> 16:47.505
That is my lot in life. Now,

16:47.507 --> 16:50.141
this is the special part
of the show where, uh...

16:50.143 --> 16:53.144
Let's call it the pièce
de résistance, shall we?

16:53.146 --> 16:56.180
Okay. So, here's where you are.

16:56.182 --> 16:59.017
You're on a boat.
You're out in the sea.

16:59.019 --> 17:01.019
You're 17 miles
off the coast of Virginia.

17:01.021 --> 17:05.256
The<i> brandywine</i> has not moved
since you boarded.

17:05.258 --> 17:07.392
Now, right here,

17:07.394 --> 17:10.161
this is where
the oil pipeline is,

17:10.163 --> 17:13.364
six miles west
of your vessel.

17:13.366 --> 17:16.501
Those divers
aren't welding pipeline.

17:18.171 --> 17:19.337
So what are they really doing
down there?

17:30.083 --> 17:31.482
You lied to federal agents.

17:31.484 --> 17:34.252
First person who tells me
the truth won't do time.

17:34.254 --> 17:36.754
(Speaking indistinctly)
I didn't sign up for this.

17:36.756 --> 17:39.390
What'd you sign up for?
Man: Special agent
Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

17:40.493 --> 17:43.327
Your reputation precedes you.

17:43.329 --> 17:45.096
Flattery?
Not really.

17:45.098 --> 17:46.097
All the better.

17:46.099 --> 17:47.298
Jerry Grossman,

17:47.300 --> 17:49.333
attorney
for Olympus underwater research.

17:49.335 --> 17:50.468
Olympus contracted
the<i> brandywine</i>

17:50.470 --> 17:52.203
for this dive mission
and, as such,

17:52.205 --> 17:55.073
is the employer of record
for everyone on board.

17:55.075 --> 17:57.075
This...

17:57.077 --> 17:59.210
Is a nondisclosure agreement.

17:59.212 --> 18:01.279
I know it's airtight
because I wrote it.

18:01.281 --> 18:02.647
Everybody on this ship

18:02.649 --> 18:04.148
signed one.

18:04.150 --> 18:06.717
We intend to uphold said
agreement vigorously.

18:09.255 --> 18:11.389
Talk and we'll sue you
for every penny you have.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.225
You see that body in there?

18:14.227 --> 18:16.360
That's a dead Navy diver.

18:16.362 --> 18:18.112
I don't need a contract.

18:18.113 --> 18:19.863
Well, conveniently,
i was born without empathy.

18:19.866 --> 18:22.133
With regard
to senior chief de la Rosa's

18:22.135 --> 18:24.369
unfortunate passing,

18:24.370 --> 18:26.604
I reviewed the video, and there
is no proof he died of anything

18:26.606 --> 18:29.507
other than complications
due to his own line of work.

18:29.509 --> 18:33.277
Secondly, even
if there were foul play,

18:33.279 --> 18:36.214
there is no link between
his death and our mission.

18:36.216 --> 18:38.216
What's your mission?
Our mission

18:38.218 --> 18:39.283
is classified.

18:49.295 --> 18:52.396
Man: I want to reconfirm
the gaseous impurity ratio.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.700
Replace that with a jb-mk
and run it again.

18:55.702 --> 18:56.734
Woman: Yes, sir.

18:56.736 --> 18:58.402
Change the intensity.
Mm-hmm.

18:59.606 --> 19:03.274
NCIS. Special agents
bishop and DiNozzo.

19:03.276 --> 19:06.144
Mattias groller,
Olympus underwater research.

19:06.146 --> 19:07.879
I don't usually have
problems with the Navy.

19:07.881 --> 19:10.214
I solve<i> their</i> problems.
What's going on?

19:10.216 --> 19:12.383
Tony:
Well, solve this one for us--
we know your company

19:12.385 --> 19:14.552
contracted the<i> brandywine</i>
for a secret project.

19:14.554 --> 19:17.421
What are the chances
you're beta-testing
your latest design?

19:17.423 --> 19:19.891
The oil pipeline nonsense
was necessary subterfuge.

19:19.893 --> 19:22.127
We're the kind of people
you can trust.

19:22.128 --> 19:24.362
Not without being formally
read in, you can't.
Mr. groller,

19:24.364 --> 19:26.631
whatever it is you're doing,
we need you to stop

19:26.633 --> 19:28.399
until we complete
our investigation.

19:28.401 --> 19:30.301
You're talking
about that Navy diver?

19:30.303 --> 19:31.702
Senior chief de la Rosa.
Mm.

19:31.704 --> 19:33.437
It's unfortunate.

19:33.439 --> 19:35.406
But I'm not
stopping anything.

19:35.408 --> 19:38.743
We're days away
from presenting this to
the secretary of the Navy.

19:38.745 --> 19:41.379
We're not shutting down
a $700 million operation

19:41.381 --> 19:43.314
because of one casualty.

19:43.316 --> 19:44.749
You might not
have a choice.

19:44.751 --> 19:46.417
Oh, there's always
a choice.

19:46.419 --> 19:48.452
U.S. Navy won't be interested
in a project

19:48.454 --> 19:50.688
that killed
one of its own.
Now, you see that?

19:50.690 --> 19:54.692
It can locate two lobsters
mating from 65 miles away.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.361
42 countries bought it,

19:57.363 --> 19:58.729
and nobody asked
if there were casualties

19:58.731 --> 20:00.598
when it was being manufactured.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.300
Senior chief de la Rosa
will have died

20:02.302 --> 20:04.202
in the name
of a greater good.

20:04.204 --> 20:05.336
That'll be a great comfort

20:05.338 --> 20:08.906
to his family at his funeral.

20:11.778 --> 20:14.278
<i> (Indistinct radio</i>
<i> communication)</i>

20:14.280 --> 20:16.480
(Tapping computer keys)

20:19.719 --> 20:21.619
Thank you.
You're welcome.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.554
(Sniffles, clears his throat)

20:29.229 --> 20:30.561
(Inhales)

20:40.273 --> 20:41.539
(Knocking on glass)

20:47.947 --> 20:49.680
Yeah?

20:49.682 --> 20:50.848
Nutter butters?

20:50.850 --> 20:53.317
What?
Look, I know
what you're thinking.

20:53.319 --> 20:55.353
Someone poisoned de la Rosa.

20:55.355 --> 20:57.321
That's why you're not eating.

20:57.323 --> 20:59.390
So I thought maybe you want
something prepackaged.

20:59.392 --> 21:01.626
Thank you,
but I'll take a rain check.

21:01.628 --> 21:03.527
Uh, agent McGee,

21:03.529 --> 21:06.797
are we witnesses here,
or are we suspects?

21:06.799 --> 21:08.666
Well, that depends.
Did you kill de la Rosa?

21:08.668 --> 21:10.868
No way.
Then I guess
you're a witness.

21:10.870 --> 21:13.738
But I think I know who did.

21:13.740 --> 21:16.374
It's Jalen.
Well, what makes
you think it's Jalen?

21:16.376 --> 21:19.577
He's getting rid
of the competition.

21:19.579 --> 21:21.545
Did you know that
he's been night diving

21:21.547 --> 21:23.347
into Mrs. de la Rosa?

21:25.418 --> 21:27.451
<i> (Phone ringing)</i>

21:28.588 --> 21:30.354
Very special agent
Anthony DiNozzo.

21:30.356 --> 21:32.006
How may I help you?

21:32.007 --> 21:33.657
Tony, hey, it's me.
Tony:
Good morning.

21:33.660 --> 21:35.526
I slept like a baby last night.

21:35.528 --> 21:37.461
How was your chair?

21:37.463 --> 21:40.398
Well, bishop's on her way to
relieve me, and I'm headed back.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.300
Listen, the divers are turning
on each other.

21:42.302 --> 21:43.534
Only a matter of time, right?

21:43.536 --> 21:45.069
Yeah, well,

21:45.071 --> 21:47.538
Sam Harper told me
that Jalen Washington

21:47.540 --> 21:49.840
was having an affair
with de la Rosa's wife.

21:49.842 --> 21:51.842
20,000 leagues
under the sheets, huh?

21:51.844 --> 21:54.512
Hey, you know you said
that Jalen had made, uh,

21:54.514 --> 21:56.480
something like 20 calls
to a burn phone?

21:56.482 --> 21:57.915
Already ahead of you, mcnemo.

21:57.917 --> 22:00.518
I'll have a warrant
by the time you helo back.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.653
Great, and, uh, if you could vet
the brandywine kitchen staff,

22:02.655 --> 22:04.021
that'd be great, too.

22:04.023 --> 22:05.756
You thinking poison,

22:05.758 --> 22:07.992
or did little Timmy not like
his waffles this morning?

22:07.994 --> 22:10.761
You know, I never thought that
i would be happy to see you,

22:10.763 --> 22:12.797
but I can't wait
to get back to the office.

22:12.799 --> 22:14.398
Do me a favor.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.734
Shower first. Thank you.

22:28.448 --> 22:29.680
(Knocking on door)

22:37.457 --> 22:38.522
NCIS?

22:39.692 --> 22:42.493
Special agent Gibbs.

22:42.495 --> 22:44.395
There's something
you forgot to mention

22:44.397 --> 22:47.498
to special agent
bishop yesterday?

22:47.500 --> 22:50.668
Come in. We can talk inside.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.778
Found that
in your garbage.

23:00.780 --> 23:04.615
I, uh... thought
it was untraceable.

23:04.617 --> 23:06.484
As long as the person
you're calling

23:06.486 --> 23:07.885
is using a burn phone, too.

23:07.887 --> 23:09.954
Jalen Washington
didn't have one.

23:13.059 --> 23:14.492
(Sighs)

23:20.533 --> 23:22.666
It was just a fling.

23:22.668 --> 23:25.102
That many calls, people are
usually planning something.

23:25.104 --> 23:27.638
What do you want me...
What do you want me to say?

23:27.640 --> 23:29.673
Anything that isn't a lie.

23:32.845 --> 23:35.479
We had an affair.

23:35.481 --> 23:36.514
I was unhappy.

23:36.516 --> 23:37.982
Your husband know?

23:37.984 --> 23:42.620
He would've killed me.

23:42.622 --> 23:44.588
I would never leave my husband.

23:44.590 --> 23:47.158
I... I was raised catholic,
agent Gibbs.

23:47.160 --> 23:48.926
My marriage was sacred.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.461
You got a funny way
of showing it.

23:51.664 --> 23:53.097
Jalen feel the same way?

23:54.534 --> 23:55.900
You think Jalen killed him?

23:55.902 --> 23:57.001
You ask him to?
No.

23:57.003 --> 23:58.602
Of course not.

23:58.604 --> 23:59.737
But Jalen-- he can be strong.

23:59.739 --> 24:01.472
He was dangerous.

24:01.474 --> 24:03.941
Do you think he could
do something like this?

24:03.943 --> 24:08.779
Love can make people
do crazy things.

24:14.086 --> 24:16.554
Aw... Gibbs.

24:16.556 --> 24:17.555
You got me a card.

24:17.557 --> 24:19.690
Yes, I did.
What do you got, Abbs?

24:19.692 --> 24:23.694
Something weird and totally
not Valentine's related.

24:23.696 --> 24:27.665
Based on the toxicology report,
senior chief de la Rosa

24:27.667 --> 24:30.601
was high on pharmaceutical-grade
cocaine when he died.

24:30.603 --> 24:32.503
That's why he was so amped.

24:32.505 --> 24:33.971
But the coke was
also mixed with

24:33.973 --> 24:36.140
significant levels
of hydrochloride.

24:36.142 --> 24:37.708
You know what that does.

24:37.710 --> 24:39.643
Sure. Turns powder
into liquid.
Exactly.

24:39.645 --> 24:42.746
But here's the, like,
super-deluxe weird part.

24:42.748 --> 24:44.882
Okay. Super-deluxe
weird me.

24:44.884 --> 24:47.485
Another ingredient
that was in the drug is

24:47.487 --> 24:49.019
organic red dye.

24:49.021 --> 24:51.155
Food coloring?
Yeah.

24:51.157 --> 24:53.958
Who would make red,
liquid cocaine?

24:53.960 --> 24:57.962
Unless, it<i> was </i>
Valentine's related.

24:57.964 --> 24:59.897
(Chuckling):
I doubt that.

25:01.033 --> 25:03.000
Gibbs?

25:03.002 --> 25:06.070
Don't you want to know
how de la Rosa died?
Overdose.

25:06.072 --> 25:08.239
No. Asphyxiation.

25:08.241 --> 25:09.807
But he didn't choke.

25:09.809 --> 25:11.809
He was breathing inert gas.

25:11.811 --> 25:14.712
Watch this.

25:24.724 --> 25:25.923
(High-pitched): Okay, Gibbs,
why is my voice is so high?

25:25.925 --> 25:28.092
Helium.
Yes.

25:28.094 --> 25:30.227
If I were to inhale
all the helium

25:30.229 --> 25:31.862
out of that balloon, then,

25:31.864 --> 25:33.864
I would be deprived
of all my oxygen.

25:33.866 --> 25:35.266
(Balloon spluttering)

25:35.268 --> 25:38.636
Which brings us to...
De la Rosa's rebreather.

25:38.638 --> 25:40.571
In order for this to work,

25:40.573 --> 25:43.707
then this hose has to be
plugged into this port.

25:43.709 --> 25:46.644
Even if it's pulled out,
like half an inch,

25:46.646 --> 25:49.246
then his percentage
of oxygen is gonna drop

25:49.248 --> 25:51.782
with every breath he takes,
but because

25:51.784 --> 25:54.685
this white hose is expelling
the carbon dioxide,

25:54.687 --> 25:56.687
he doesn't even know
he's dying, Gibbs.

25:56.689 --> 25:59.924
And in four
to six minutes, he's dead.

25:59.926 --> 26:02.693
Someone inside the chamber
tampered with his air hose.

26:02.695 --> 26:07.097
One of those three divers
definitely killed him.

26:15.808 --> 26:17.775
Mark:
Divers! Alternate air source!

26:17.777 --> 26:18.976
Go to the bibs!

26:18.978 --> 26:20.344
Flushing the chamber
in ten...

26:20.346 --> 26:24.682
Nine, eight, seven, six...

26:24.684 --> 26:25.716
(Computer blips,
video stops)

26:26.652 --> 26:28.252
That smells good.

26:28.254 --> 26:29.720
Is that a bishop?

26:29.722 --> 26:31.288
No.

26:31.290 --> 26:33.290
It is a McGee,
and it is very good.

26:33.292 --> 26:35.626
Ah. And you didn't think
to get me one?

26:35.628 --> 26:37.628
Well, no, because
i was the one

26:37.630 --> 26:39.263
starving on the
dive boat all night.

26:39.265 --> 26:41.699
Okay. Easy, mcsensitive.

26:41.701 --> 26:43.367
Put away the "hangry."

26:43.369 --> 26:46.036
Abby thinks she narrowed it down
to someone in the chamber.

26:46.038 --> 26:47.237
Bishop mentioned that

26:47.239 --> 26:48.872
as I was clocking out.

26:48.874 --> 26:50.307
Who's it looking like?

26:50.309 --> 26:52.343
Well, I've zaprudered
this surveillance video

26:52.345 --> 26:54.612
over and over,
and I just can't figure it out.

26:54.614 --> 26:56.981
De la Rosa's air hose
port is on the wall.

26:56.983 --> 26:59.149
Any of the divers could
have unplugged it.

26:59.151 --> 27:01.251
Truth isn't always easy
to see, DiNozzo.

27:01.253 --> 27:02.753
Copy that, boss.

27:02.755 --> 27:04.054
Chamber secure.

27:04.056 --> 27:05.055
The O2 level's in bounds.

27:05.057 --> 27:07.224
Disengage bibs.

27:07.226 --> 27:09.793
How did de la Rosa get
liquid cocaine in his system?

27:11.130 --> 27:13.797
Who unplugged
his breathing unit?

27:13.799 --> 27:15.666
We're working on that.
We're working on that, boss.

27:15.668 --> 27:17.735
There's only
three suspects,

27:17.737 --> 27:21.271
and they're locked
into a little metal tube.

27:22.141 --> 27:24.675
How hard can this be?

27:25.845 --> 27:27.811
Somebody's hangry.

27:27.813 --> 27:29.980
Huh.

27:35.254 --> 27:37.921
Man (Over P.A.): All hands, work
ongoing on the fo'c'sle deck,

27:37.923 --> 27:39.356
forward of bosun's locker.

27:39.358 --> 27:41.258
All hands stay clear.

27:49.869 --> 27:51.902
I know who did it.
Bishop:
Who?

27:51.904 --> 27:54.872
It was Meredith. She's
a psycho lunatic bitch.

27:54.874 --> 27:56.373
Hey, what the hell
are you doing, Jalen?

27:56.375 --> 27:58.308
She and de la Rosa came
back from their last dive.

27:58.310 --> 28:00.044
She was acting real strange.

28:00.046 --> 28:02.312
Half hour later,
he's dead.
Strange how?

28:02.314 --> 28:04.381
Jalen, man,
shut up.
Just strange, okay?

28:04.383 --> 28:06.183
You know she killed a guy
once with her bare hands?

28:06.185 --> 28:07.351
Jalen's throwing you
under the bus.

28:07.353 --> 28:09.353
What the hell?
Shut up, Washington!

28:09.355 --> 28:10.954
What happened
on that last dive, huh?!

28:10.956 --> 28:12.423
What did you do?
You son of a bitch.

28:12.425 --> 28:14.692
Are you accusing me?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, guys, guys, guys.

28:14.694 --> 28:16.760
All right, guys, really?
Guys, guys, guys, guys...

28:16.762 --> 28:18.328
Psycho nut-job!
All right, guys, stop!

28:20.099 --> 28:22.199
Oh, special agent Gibbs,
welcome back. Hope you got

28:22.201 --> 28:23.801
some sleep
on the mainland.

28:23.802 --> 28:25.402
Cap'n, this is
your ship, right?

28:25.404 --> 28:27.404
Yes, sir.
One of your
crew is dead.

28:27.406 --> 28:29.973
Yet, you do nothing about it?

28:29.975 --> 28:31.875
Grossman:
Senior chief de la Rosa
was not part of his crew.

28:31.877 --> 28:33.243
He worked for us.

28:33.245 --> 28:34.712
And he knew better
than anyone

28:34.714 --> 28:36.146
the inherent risks
of saturation diving.

28:36.148 --> 28:37.815
But he didn't die underwater.

28:37.817 --> 28:39.216
Accidents happen.

28:39.218 --> 28:40.417
This was no accident.
Prove it!

28:42.788 --> 28:44.288
Grossman: You know,

28:44.290 --> 28:47.124
I heard about that little stunt
your medical examiner pulled.

28:47.126 --> 28:50.194
What did he call it?
Remote autopsy?

28:50.196 --> 28:54.765
Unprecedented, irresponsible
and inadmissible.

28:59.071 --> 29:02.439
17 miles away from land, I still
can't get away from lawyers.

29:02.441 --> 29:04.108
Hammond:
Wait.

29:13.219 --> 29:15.352
Agent Gibbs, you're certain
de la Rosa was murdered?

29:15.354 --> 29:17.154
I watched the video.

29:17.156 --> 29:18.989
Looked like the guys
were trying to help him.

29:18.991 --> 29:20.491
Even hooked him
up to the bibs.

29:23.429 --> 29:26.296
One of them uncoupled
his air hose.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.767
Careful, Hammond.

29:34.140 --> 29:35.239
It was Sam.

29:35.241 --> 29:37.341
Captain, you are
officially in breach.

29:37.343 --> 29:39.009
My contract says

29:39.011 --> 29:41.211
that I can't reveal our mission,
and I haven't.

29:41.213 --> 29:44.448
It doesn't say that I can't help
solve the murder of a friend.

29:46.886 --> 29:48.385
How do you know?

29:48.387 --> 29:50.921
About two years back...

29:50.923 --> 29:53.791
A diver on a ship in the
north sea nearly died

29:53.793 --> 29:55.926
because of a
misconnected hose.

29:55.928 --> 29:59.129
His partner on
that mission...

29:59.131 --> 30:02.466
Was Sam Harper.

30:02.468 --> 30:04.067
Captain was right, boss.

30:04.069 --> 30:05.936
On a dive boat
in the north sea,

30:05.938 --> 30:07.538
a saturation diver
lost consciousness

30:07.540 --> 30:09.540
after using
his rebreathing mask.

30:09.542 --> 30:12.576
It was ruled an accident at the
time, but Sam was his partner.

30:12.578 --> 30:14.545
That still doesn't make him
a killer.

30:14.547 --> 30:17.314
Okay, you want a killer?
There's Meredith ragan.

30:17.316 --> 30:19.416
I got her army transcript
unsealed.

30:19.418 --> 30:22.085
Spoke with her C.O. in Kabul.

30:22.087 --> 30:24.555
Like Jalen said,
she actually killed someone

30:24.557 --> 30:26.223
with her bare hands.

30:26.225 --> 30:28.392
Who?
She thought it was
an insurgent.

30:28.394 --> 30:29.893
Turned out to be a translator.

30:29.895 --> 30:31.428
She agreed to leave the army;

30:31.430 --> 30:33.897
the army agreed
not to press charges.

30:33.899 --> 30:38.502
So... what is her motive
for killing de la Rosa?

30:38.504 --> 30:41.138
Mentor, team leader,

30:41.140 --> 30:42.539
unrequited love?

30:42.541 --> 30:44.842
It's a Valentine's day massacre.

30:44.844 --> 30:45.843
Come on.

30:45.845 --> 30:46.877
We're missing something.

30:46.879 --> 30:48.445
(Door closes)
McGee: Boss, I'm in.

30:48.447 --> 30:50.480
Got through
Olympus's firewall.

30:50.482 --> 30:52.049
I know what
the divers are doing--

30:52.051 --> 30:54.551
beta-testing a secret
project code-named

30:54.553 --> 30:57.454
ppa-- it stands
for pre-positioned assets.

30:57.456 --> 30:58.522
Keep talking.

30:58.524 --> 30:59.523
Syncing a graphic

30:59.525 --> 31:01.208
on your laptop.

31:01.209 --> 31:02.892
Now, basically,
ppa's are watertight closets

31:02.895 --> 31:05.495
that can be
filled with weapons,
supplies, then buried

31:05.497 --> 31:07.931
at the bottom of the ocean
anywhere in the world.

31:07.933 --> 31:10.934
You just press a button and it
pops right up to the surface.

31:10.936 --> 31:12.369
Pretty cool, actually.

31:12.371 --> 31:14.504
The Navy hasn't
bought this yet?

31:14.506 --> 31:16.506
Well, Olympus is supposed
to deliver the results

31:16.508 --> 31:18.442
of their final beta test
next week,

31:18.444 --> 31:20.577
and this murder could scuttle
the whole deal.

31:27.453 --> 31:29.453
Gibbs, are the sailors
getting younger,

31:29.455 --> 31:31.555
or are we getting older?

31:31.557 --> 31:33.423
How is Allison, admiral?

31:33.425 --> 31:35.225
She still loves me,

31:35.227 --> 31:36.460
so I must be doing
something right.

31:36.462 --> 31:37.461
How's the knee?

31:37.463 --> 31:39.463
Oh, it's mostly good.

31:39.465 --> 31:41.531
I know when it's gonna rain.

31:41.533 --> 31:43.634
So, ppa's.

31:43.636 --> 31:45.969
Revolutionary idea.

31:45.971 --> 31:48.138
It would eliminate tens of
millions in transport costs

31:48.140 --> 31:49.640
and change the way
we fight wars.

31:49.642 --> 31:51.675
Like having an
arsenal standing by.

31:51.677 --> 31:55.212
The Navy would have
been very interested
in Olympus's technology.

31:55.214 --> 31:57.047
What happened?

31:57.049 --> 31:59.516
The containers don't work.
They leak.

31:59.518 --> 32:02.352
They can't withstand
the immense pressures at
the bottom of the ocean.

32:02.354 --> 32:04.254
Weapons and seawater don't mix.

32:07.559 --> 32:09.126
(Phone keypad beeping)

32:09.128 --> 32:10.627
Abby: Gibbs.

32:10.629 --> 32:12.980
Hey, Abbs.

32:12.981 --> 32:15.332
I need you and McGee
to look into something for me.

32:18.637 --> 32:20.637
Abby:
McGee.

32:20.639 --> 32:22.072
That's sweet.

32:22.074 --> 32:24.241
Burt and I donated
to each other's

32:24.243 --> 32:26.310
favorite animal charity
for Valentine's.

32:26.312 --> 32:27.644
What'd you get Delilah?

32:27.646 --> 32:29.413
Uh, I'm actually
writing her a poem.

32:29.415 --> 32:32.416
Oh. That's so romantic!

32:32.418 --> 32:33.650
What rhymes with Delilah?

32:33.652 --> 32:35.719
It's free verse.

32:36.689 --> 32:37.688
So, you ready?

32:37.690 --> 32:39.156
Gibbs:
Yep. Ready.

32:39.158 --> 32:40.557
All right, show me.

32:40.559 --> 32:42.125
Boss, I present to you

32:42.127 --> 32:44.127
the pre-positioned asset.

32:44.129 --> 32:46.430
Revolutionary technology,
but it leaks like a sieve,

32:46.432 --> 32:48.231
and the Navy passed on it.

32:48.233 --> 32:49.733
But it's not
totally useless.

32:49.735 --> 32:52.970
I mean, it's still a secret
underground closet.

32:52.972 --> 32:55.605
So what could you put inside
that wouldn't be affected

32:55.607 --> 32:57.407
by ocean water?

32:57.409 --> 32:59.009
Sealed vial of liquid cocaine.

32:59.011 --> 33:00.978
Okay, you're really
good at this game.

33:00.980 --> 33:02.579
Now for the beta test.

33:02.581 --> 33:05.248
Normally, liquid cocaine
is clear and water is clear.

33:05.250 --> 33:06.450
So to prove
that the vial

33:06.452 --> 33:08.719
is still sealed,
you would need...?

33:08.721 --> 33:10.721
Red food coloring.
Exactly.

33:10.723 --> 33:12.556
Now, if the red doesn't leak,

33:12.558 --> 33:15.025
you've got
the perfect hiding spot

33:15.027 --> 33:17.995
for drug cartels up and down
the eastern seaboard.

33:17.997 --> 33:21.598
So the divers' mission
was to position the ppa.

33:21.600 --> 33:24.534
But what if one of the divers
knew there were drugs inside?

33:24.536 --> 33:27.604
He would have to check the vial
to ensure that it didn't leak.

33:27.606 --> 33:29.339
Gibbs: De la Rosa saw that

33:29.341 --> 33:30.707
and became a witness.

33:30.709 --> 33:32.175
They slipped him some coke,

33:32.177 --> 33:34.344
hoping he would have a stroke
or heart attack,

33:34.346 --> 33:35.645
but it wasn't enough.

33:35.647 --> 33:37.647
So they cut off his airflow.

33:37.648 --> 33:39.648
Abby: We just don't know
which diver did it.

33:41.020 --> 33:43.186
Jalen: Look, you're both talking
way too much.

33:43.188 --> 33:44.755
We've got
three more days in here,

33:44.757 --> 33:46.590
so you both need to chill.

33:46.592 --> 33:48.759
Something I want
to ask you about...

33:48.761 --> 33:50.727
Divers, we're moving to 8 a-t-m.

33:50.729 --> 33:52.696
You got it, mark--
8 a-t-m.

33:52.698 --> 33:53.764
Meredith: You don't get
to ask me anything.

33:53.766 --> 33:56.700
I can't talk
to you, ma'am.

33:56.702 --> 33:59.036
I'll talk; You listen.

34:00.406 --> 34:02.672
We know about
the pre-positioned assets.

34:02.674 --> 34:04.674
We know they're not watertight.

34:04.676 --> 34:06.676
Mission failed.

34:06.678 --> 34:09.312
I looked you up, Bob.

34:09.314 --> 34:11.782
You were in the Navy
like de la Rosa.

34:11.784 --> 34:15.152
You called because you wanted
justice for your friend.

34:17.723 --> 34:19.556
Help us find his killer.

34:22.795 --> 34:26.063
On the morning
de la Rosa died...

34:26.065 --> 34:29.132
We got a breach alert
on the ppa.

34:29.134 --> 34:30.801
Breach alert?

34:30.803 --> 34:33.070
One of the divers
opened it up underwater

34:33.072 --> 34:34.337
and took something out.

34:34.339 --> 34:35.872
Meredith:
You've got to calm down!

34:35.873 --> 34:37.406
Mind your own business, okay?
No, you mind your own business

34:37.409 --> 34:38.775
you're gonna be accusing me?

34:38.777 --> 34:40.577
Washington, what's your problem?

34:40.579 --> 34:43.346
Hey, there's no problem, boss.

34:43.348 --> 34:46.283
Just a misunderstanding.

34:52.724 --> 34:54.624
(Jalen grunting)
Sam: You did it...!

34:54.626 --> 34:56.326
One bullet
through this window,

34:56.328 --> 34:57.694
the room equalizes,
and you all die.

34:57.696 --> 34:59.596
(Raspy gasping)

34:59.598 --> 35:00.864
That's bulletproof glass.

35:00.866 --> 35:02.666
You want to test it?

35:02.668 --> 35:03.834
(Jalen coughing)

35:03.836 --> 35:05.735
Agent bishop,
we just solved your murder.

35:07.106 --> 35:09.206
Jalen did it.

35:09.208 --> 35:10.774
Jalen (Raspy):
No, no...

35:21.587 --> 35:22.719
What happened?

35:22.721 --> 35:23.553
I will duct tape
your mouth closed...

35:23.555 --> 35:24.788
(All yelling at once)

35:24.790 --> 35:26.423
What happened!

35:26.425 --> 35:28.592
They're crazy!
This jerk
right here...

35:28.594 --> 35:29.759
(Meredith shouting)

35:29.761 --> 35:30.861
One at a time!

35:30.863 --> 35:32.762
Make them un-tape me!

35:32.764 --> 35:34.564
Not gonna happen.
Agent Gibbs,

35:34.566 --> 35:37.167
please pass your handcuffs
through the airlock.

35:37.169 --> 35:38.502
Stop!

35:38.503 --> 35:39.836
You don't...
Stop talking!

35:41.440 --> 35:43.874
You. You. Talk.

35:43.876 --> 35:45.142
I'm just standing there
and they start

35:45.144 --> 35:46.209
beating the crap out of me!

35:46.211 --> 35:47.177
Why?

35:47.179 --> 35:48.512
Look, we found<i> this</i>

35:48.514 --> 35:49.846
under his pillow.

35:49.848 --> 35:51.148
Yeah, for my protection!

35:51.149 --> 35:52.449
We need protection
from him!

35:52.451 --> 35:55.418
What else is
he hiding?
Come on! No way!

35:55.420 --> 35:56.786
What are you afraid of?
What are we gonna find, huh?

35:56.788 --> 35:59.489
A gun?
Jalen: Whatever's
in there, they planted,

35:59.491 --> 36:01.625
you got
to believe that.
Another knife?

36:01.627 --> 36:04.794
It's for work!
So is it yours,
or was it "planted"?

36:04.796 --> 36:06.246
Meredith:
It doesn't matter,

36:06.247 --> 36:07.697
it's mine now.
Hey, uh, agent Gibbs,

36:07.699 --> 36:09.499
what should we do
with him, huh?

36:10.836 --> 36:13.303
I'll see you
when the hatch opens.

36:13.305 --> 36:14.838
Jalen:
What?

36:14.840 --> 36:17.541
(Voices muted)

36:19.645 --> 36:23.613
<i> (Indistinct radio</i>
<i> communication)</i>

36:23.615 --> 36:25.715
Grossman:
Where's your boss?
Tony: He couldn't make it.

36:25.717 --> 36:28.652
Grossman: Tell him I said hi.
Bishop:
You can tell him yourself.

36:29.655 --> 36:31.288
No, please, I didn't do it.

36:31.290 --> 36:32.856
We know.
Meredith ragan.

36:32.858 --> 36:33.890
What?

36:33.892 --> 36:35.225
Oh, come on.

36:35.227 --> 36:36.560
You're under arrest
for the murder

36:36.562 --> 36:37.761
of Diego de la Rosa.

36:37.763 --> 36:39.029
You've got
to be kidding me!

36:39.030 --> 36:40.296
Grossman...
I'll take care of this.

36:40.299 --> 36:41.698
You're making
a huge mistake.

36:41.700 --> 36:42.899
Meredith: You really think
i would do something like this?

36:42.901 --> 36:43.900
Grossman:
Meredith, don't say a word.

36:48.740 --> 36:50.874
Agent Gibbs, whatever
you think you have

36:50.876 --> 36:52.909
is circumstantial nonsense.

36:52.911 --> 36:55.579
I've already filed
a grievance to have
the entire case thrown out.

36:55.581 --> 36:57.347
Mmm-mm!

36:59.718 --> 37:01.751
My mom used to make this
for dessert.

37:01.753 --> 37:03.587
What the hell are you doing?

37:03.589 --> 37:05.989
It's cherry.

37:07.659 --> 37:09.459
You want to try some, Meredith?

37:14.266 --> 37:18.802
You know... there's
a small percentage of people

37:18.804 --> 37:22.572
who can't eat
anything processed red.

37:22.574 --> 37:24.341
Mm,

37:24.343 --> 37:27.777
allergies and...

37:27.779 --> 37:29.479
Even rashes,

37:29.481 --> 37:31.948
Meredith.

37:31.950 --> 37:35.619
Like... like that rash
you have right there, Meredith.

37:37.689 --> 37:40.257
You must have touched
something red recently, huh?

37:43.428 --> 37:44.894
Like, uh...

37:47.699 --> 37:49.966
...like a vial
of red liquid cocaine.

37:52.938 --> 37:54.938
Found them inside the ppa

37:54.940 --> 37:56.806
your divers positioned
on the ocean floor.

37:56.808 --> 38:00.510
There's, uh,
200 of them.

38:00.512 --> 38:02.045
That's a whole lot
of drug money.

38:02.047 --> 38:03.847
It's inadmissible garbage.

38:03.849 --> 38:06.416
Doesn't make any sense.
Where would Meredith

38:06.418 --> 38:07.884
get narcotics
like that?

38:07.886 --> 38:10.453
Oh, she didn't--
she had a partner...

38:10.455 --> 38:12.989
Who is, uh, being arrested
as we speak.

38:16.361 --> 38:18.061
In 2010,

38:18.063 --> 38:21.064
you represented
the Suarez cartel.

38:21.066 --> 38:22.999
Their signature
product was...

38:23.001 --> 38:25.635
Liquid cocaine.

38:25.637 --> 38:29.673
Last month, you had
a meeting in cartagena.

38:36.014 --> 38:39.015
We've been tracking
your pre-positioned asset.

38:39.017 --> 38:40.684
Last night it was
called to the surface

38:40.686 --> 38:42.519
and loaded onto a
Colombian freighter

38:42.521 --> 38:44.754
DEA raided the vessel.

38:51.863 --> 38:53.096
You dumb-ass!

38:53.098 --> 38:54.798
Shut up, Meredith.

38:54.800 --> 38:57.867
No, Jerry... you shut up.

39:02.341 --> 39:03.640
Huh.

39:03.642 --> 39:04.974
Hey.

39:04.976 --> 39:08.345
Look what I found
on the copier.

39:08.347 --> 39:10.747
Edgar Allan McGee's
love poem to Delilah.

39:10.749 --> 39:12.916
Don't read that, Tony.

39:12.918 --> 39:15.485
Well, how else
can I make fun of my coworker?

39:15.487 --> 39:18.054
"My darling Delilah,
you've ignited my soul..."

39:21.893 --> 39:23.793
What?

39:23.795 --> 39:26.096
That's actually very romantic.

39:27.432 --> 39:29.466
Where'd your roses go?

39:29.468 --> 39:31.935
I gave them to McGee.
He needed them more than me.

39:31.937 --> 39:33.103
Hey, before you go...

39:36.074 --> 39:37.006
I got you something.

39:37.008 --> 39:39.008
Really?

39:39.010 --> 39:41.678
You said you wanted
to watch a movie.

39:42.881 --> 39:44.381
<i> Aliens.</i>

39:44.383 --> 39:46.883
I was gonna go with
<i> the abyss,</i> but...

39:46.885 --> 39:49.452
That James Cameron knows
how to make a movie.

39:49.454 --> 39:50.920
Anyway, you should
head home, missy.

39:50.922 --> 39:53.156
In half an hour,
gennari's is gonna be delivering
