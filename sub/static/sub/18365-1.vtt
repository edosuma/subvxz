<i>Old Yeller, Old Yeller</i>

00:20.646 --> 00:23.274
<i>Old Yeller</i>

00:23.607 --> 00:25.676
<i>Here, Yeller</i>

00:25.776 --> 00:27.803
<i>Come back, Yeller</i>

00:27.903 --> 00:31.407
<i>Best doggone dog in the West</i>

00:31.865 --> 00:33.934
<i>Old Yeller was a mongrel</i>

00:34.034 --> 00:36.437
<i>An ugly lop-eared mongrel</i>

00:36.537 --> 00:39.106
<i>Fancy-free without a family tree</i>

00:40.666 --> 00:42.609
<i>But he could up and do it</i>

00:42.709 --> 00:44.903
<i>And prove there's nothin' to it</i>

00:45.003 --> 00:48.598
<i>And that's how a good dog should be</i>

00:49.633 --> 00:51.743
<i>Here, Yeller</i>

00:51.843 --> 00:53.871
<i>Come back, Yeller</i>

00:53.971 --> 01:02.212
<i>Best doggone dog in the West</i>

01:02.312 --> 01:04.423
<i>Old Yeller was a hunter</i>

01:04.522 --> 01:06.675
<i>A rarin', tearin' hunter</i>

01:06.775 --> 01:09.553
<i>In any chase he knew just how to run</i>

01:10.779 --> 01:13.056
<i>And when he hunted trouble</i>

01:13.156 --> 01:15.184
<i>He always found it double</i>

01:15.284 --> 01:19.710
<i>And that's when Old Yeller had fun</i>

01:19.997 --> 01:22.107
<i>Here, Yeller</i>

01:22.207 --> 01:24.151
<i>Come back, Yeller</i>

01:24.251 --> 01:27.380

01:28.672 --> 01:34.020
<i>Best doggone dog in the West</i>

01:34.970 --> 01:39.124
<i>Old Yeller was a fighter
A rootin', tootin' fighter</i>

01:39.224 --> 01:41.835
<i>In any scrap he knew just what to do</i>

01:41.935 --> 01:43.420
<i>Knew what to do</i>

01:43.520 --> 01:45.672
<i>A rough and ready feller</i>

01:45.772 --> 01:47.841
<i>Although his coat was yeller</i>

01:47.941 --> 01:50.844
<i>His bold Texas heart was true blue</i>

01:50.944 --> 01:52.287
<i>True blue</i>

02:13.091 --> 02:15.810
<i>In the west</i>

02:18.221 --> 02:22.292
- What's Pop gonna sell our steers for?
- For money, of course.

02:22.392 --> 02:25.963
- What's money?
- It's what you buy things with.

02:26.063 --> 02:28.465
What do you mean by "buy things"?

02:28.565 --> 02:31.677
Well, if you got money,
you give it to people for stuff.

02:31.777 --> 02:34.263
They say you can get anything for money.

02:34.363 --> 02:36.765
Anything? What's it look like?

02:36.865 --> 02:39.226
Well, I never seen but one piece,

02:39.326 --> 02:41.728
a dollar bill Papa had. It's paper.

02:41.828 --> 02:45.232
- What'd Papa get with this dollar?
- Nothin'. It wasn't no good.

02:45.332 --> 02:48.360
But you just said you could
get anything with money.

02:48.460 --> 02:50.571
Well, ya can.
But Papa's was Confederate.

02:50.671 --> 02:54.366
- What's Confederate money?
- Confederate money?

02:54.466 --> 02:56.810
Well, it's...

02:57.386 --> 03:00.765
- Well?
- Don't you ever run outta questions?

03:03.809 --> 03:05.419
I wish you didn't have to go.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.546
Right now I feel
sorta the same way, but...

03:07.646 --> 03:09.715
I put 100 head of our steers
in that pool herd

03:09.815 --> 03:13.260
and in Kansas, we can get, maybe,
$4, $5 a head for 'em.

03:13.360 --> 03:16.847
- Cash money, too.
- I know, but...

03:16.947 --> 03:19.099
Ain't nothin' to be sad about,
Katie girl.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.226
When you think on it, we're lucky.

03:21.326 --> 03:23.729
There's us and the young 'uns,
good land,

03:23.829 --> 03:26.332
plenty of water, game for the killin'.

03:26.832 --> 03:30.861
Cash money is all we need
to get a tight tail-hold on the world.

03:30.961 --> 03:33.089
Will you really be gone three months?

03:34.631 --> 03:37.305
All of three months, maybe four.

03:46.727 --> 03:50.607
Now, honey,
it ain't nothin' to cry about.

03:51.481 --> 03:54.760
It's just that we've
never been separated before.

03:54.860 --> 03:56.720
You know what I'm gonna do
when I sell them steers?

03:56.820 --> 03:57.763
What?

03:57.863 --> 03:59.723
I'm gonna get you a store-bought dress.

03:59.823 --> 04:02.952
The first one you've had
since we come to Texas.

04:04.619 --> 04:06.496
Let's see.

04:06.955 --> 04:09.583
Is this about the right size?

04:21.553 --> 04:24.181
Papa! I aim to go with ya!

04:24.723 --> 04:26.792
You better stay here
and take care of your mama.

04:26.892 --> 04:29.566
Aw, gee, Papa.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.923
But I wanna go. I tell ya, I wanna go!

04:33.023 --> 04:35.425
- I wanna go! Wanna go!
- Arliss.

04:35.525 --> 04:38.053
- You ride a piece with me, Travis.
- All right, Papa.

04:38.153 --> 04:41.682
I wanna go! But I wanna go!

04:41.782 --> 04:44.706
I can ride them old cows same as you.

04:45.327 --> 04:48.772
You can't go on no cow drive, boy.
Them Injuns would scalp you for sure.

04:48.872 --> 04:52.046
- You think so, Papa?
- I'm certain.

05:01.927 --> 05:03.144
Good-bye, Katie.

05:03.845 --> 05:05.688
Good-bye, Jim dear.

05:21.905 --> 05:25.767
Well, son, while I'm gone,
you'll be the man of the house.

05:25.867 --> 05:27.039
Yes, sir.

05:27.494 --> 05:31.189
There'll be the pigs to mark,
fresh meat to shoot.

05:31.289 --> 05:33.066
And mainly, there's the corn patch.

05:33.166 --> 05:37.154
If you don't work it right,
we'll be without bread this winter.

05:37.254 --> 05:40.907
It's sure enough a man-sized job.

05:41.007 --> 05:43.994
Think you can handle Old Jumper
when he's hooked to a plow?

05:44.094 --> 05:47.205
I'll handle him,
or I'll bust his jawbone with a club.

05:48.705 --> 05:52.332
Well, all right, boy.
I'll see you this fall.

05:52.435 --> 05:55.797
- Papa, you ain't forgettin' the horse?
- What horse?

05:55.897 --> 05:59.276
Now, Papa, you know I've been
achin' all over for a horse to ride.

05:59.401 --> 06:00.927
I told you time and again.

06:01.027 --> 06:03.325
Well, what you're needin'
worse than a horse is a good dog.

06:03.530 --> 06:06.391
Yes, sir, but what I'm wantin' worst
is a good horse.

06:06.491 --> 06:10.837
All right, boy. You act a man's part,
and I'll bring you a man's horse.

06:11.663 --> 06:12.960
Wanna shake on it?

06:50.285 --> 06:51.269
Whoa.

07:08.553 --> 07:09.770
Whoa!

07:20.398 --> 07:22.196
Whoa, Jumper! Whoa!

07:25.779 --> 07:27.497
Whoa! Whoa, Jumper!

07:28.490 --> 07:30.367
Get away from that mule!

07:34.454 --> 07:36.877
Let that mule alone!

07:43.712 --> 07:46.967
Papa ain't gone a full day
and look what a mess.

07:49.636 --> 07:52.890
- It's not your fault, son.
- Maybe not, but...

07:55.725 --> 07:58.399
Get, you crazy fool dog! Get!

08:09.906 --> 08:11.766
I know one thing.

08:11.866 --> 08:15.666
That old dog better not come around
here while I got me a gun in my hands.

08:19.582 --> 08:22.485
- Who busted down the fence?
- Where have you been?

08:22.585 --> 08:25.196
Bear huntin'. Who busted the fence down?

08:25.296 --> 08:28.450
- Danged old stray dog.
- Dog? Where is he?

08:28.550 --> 08:31.975
You won't ever see him.
I done rocked him clean off this place.

08:32.136 --> 08:34.765
But I need me a good huntin' dog.

08:34.931 --> 08:37.082
Arliss, go wash up
before supper's all cold.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.356
- Aw, Mama.
- Go on!

08:40.645 --> 08:43.239
- What do you got in that pocket?
- Nothin'.

08:43.398 --> 08:45.717
- Let's see what you got this time.
- Aw, Mama.

08:45.817 --> 08:48.678
Come on. Come on.

08:48.778 --> 08:52.140
Oh, Arliss! How can you even
touch those ugly things?

08:52.240 --> 08:53.183
They aren't ugly.

08:53.283 --> 08:56.811
Look it here at his belly,
how soft and smooth and pretty it is.

08:56.911 --> 08:59.356
I know. Everything you catch is pretty.
But take him outta here.

08:59.456 --> 09:00.523
You can't keep him in the house.

09:00.623 --> 09:02.150
You mean I gotta throw him away?

09:02.250 --> 09:04.152
And everything else
you got in those pockets.

09:04.252 --> 09:06.480
My frog, too?

09:07.380 --> 09:10.475
Arliss, what all have you got
in those pockets?

09:14.929 --> 09:17.432
Aw, Mama, it's just
a little old garter snake.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.150
I don't care. Get it out of here!

09:21.269 --> 09:24.631
Arliss, if you don't stop catchin' things
and bringin' 'em into the house,

09:24.731 --> 09:26.699
I'm gonna switch you good.

09:27.609 --> 09:30.887
And don't you ever,
ever pick up a snake again.

09:30.987 --> 09:32.806
- Ya understand?
- Yes'm.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.766
Now, go out there
and wash up for supper.

09:34.866 --> 09:36.834
Little old garter snake ain't harmful.

09:36.951 --> 09:39.437
If he'll pick up one kind of snake,
he'll pick up another.

09:39.537 --> 09:41.898
Next time it could be a rattler.

09:41.998 --> 09:45.819
I wish he did have a good dog,
like Old Bell.

09:45.919 --> 09:49.406
When you were little, Old Bell
wouldn't let you near anything harmful.

09:49.506 --> 09:52.635
Ain't another dog in this world
like Old Bell was.

09:53.510 --> 09:57.185
Sure would've made short work
of that old, yeller stray.

10:27.752 --> 10:29.796
Mama.

10:33.216 --> 10:35.184
I was just thinkin'.

10:37.971 --> 10:41.374
About your papa.
I guess he's eaten his breakfast by now.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.568
Probably wanted to get an early start.

10:45.061 --> 10:47.063
I wonder how far they got yesterday.

10:47.480 --> 10:50.050
Oh, I don't know.
Papa says 15 mile a day

10:50.150 --> 10:52.469
is a long haul for a trail herd.

10:52.569 --> 10:54.913
I guess he made about 10 mile.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.724
Mush is about ready.
If you want middling meat with it,

10:57.824 --> 10:59.642
better go out and cut some down.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.164
All right.

11:07.333 --> 11:10.052
Mama, what happened
to the middling meat?

11:13.089 --> 11:15.763
Why, you no-account, thievin' rascal!

11:16.259 --> 11:18.353
Get outta here!

11:21.931 --> 11:23.183
A dog!

11:25.768 --> 11:27.486
All right!

11:29.314 --> 11:32.033
You hit my dog
and I'll wear you to a frazzle.

11:32.775 --> 11:34.469
Travis, Arliss, whatcha doin' out there?

11:34.569 --> 11:38.139
- Let go of my stick!
- Arliss! Arliss.

11:38.239 --> 11:40.350
Don't you dare hit your brother.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.185
He was tryin' to kill my dog.

11:42.285 --> 11:44.854
He's not your dog,
and I never even touched him.

11:44.954 --> 11:46.356
Where on earth did he come from?

11:46.456 --> 11:48.525
He's that same stray dog
that wrecked the fence.

11:48.625 --> 11:50.377
Stole that big side
of middling meat there too!

11:50.752 --> 11:53.380
He's my dog.
Ain't nobody gonna try to hurt him.

11:55.506 --> 11:57.304
Well.

12:00.386 --> 12:02.229
Looks like we've got us a dog.

12:02.555 --> 12:05.708
Mama, you don't mean we're gonna
keep that old, ugly yeller dog

12:05.808 --> 12:07.085
after what he done?

12:07.185 --> 12:11.756
He isn't a ugly yeller dog.
He's a pretty yeller dog.

12:11.856 --> 12:13.153
Come on now.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.321
Come on.

12:23.952 --> 12:26.062
Why not let Arliss claim him?

12:26.162 --> 12:28.148
And have him stampedin' Jumper again?

12:28.248 --> 12:29.607
You could break him of that.

12:29.707 --> 12:32.318
He's a thief, Mama!
He'll steal us blind.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.779
Most creatures will steal
when they're hungry enough.

12:34.879 --> 12:37.473
All right, but I still don't want him!

12:37.882 --> 12:40.910
Now, Travis, you're not bein' fair.

12:41.010 --> 12:44.330
You had a dog when you were little,
and Arliss has never had one.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.875
He's too little for you to play with.
He gets lonely.

12:50.186 --> 12:53.089
After breakfast, you can
take to the woods and get us a deer.

12:53.189 --> 12:55.800
And, Travis, do some thinkin'
on what I said

12:55.900 --> 12:58.870
about Arliss and that old, yeller dog.

13:00.154 --> 13:02.532
Come on, boy.

13:41.946 --> 13:44.244
Jumper, you jug head!

13:46.951 --> 13:49.771
A bunch of bobwhites,
and you act like you ain't got the brains

13:49.871 --> 13:52.249
of a blind goose in a hail storm.

15:50.783 --> 15:53.603
Arliss, get that dirty,
old dog outta our drinkin' water!

15:53.703 --> 15:56.081
Aw, mind your own business!

15:56.289 --> 15:58.462
Get outta there!

16:02.712 --> 16:06.057
You quit rockin' my dog!

16:07.592 --> 16:10.162
Quit chuckin' them rocks at me!

16:19.228 --> 16:21.481
Stop it, Arliss! Stop it!

16:21.981 --> 16:23.466
You rock my dog again

16:23.566 --> 16:25.635
- and I'll bust your head open!
- Arliss!

16:25.735 --> 16:26.782
Arliss!

16:28.738 --> 16:31.140
Travis, what are you doin'
to your little brother?

16:31.240 --> 16:33.476
Him and that dirty, old, yeller dog
were wallowing in our drinkin' water.

16:33.576 --> 16:34.811
He was rockin' my dog!

16:34.911 --> 16:37.563
Look here, young rooster.
If you wanna keep outta trouble,

16:37.663 --> 16:39.232
you start minding your big brother.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.109
You mean I gotta mind him?

16:41.209 --> 16:42.443
He ain't my papa.

16:42.543 --> 16:43.694
You start mindin' him just the same.

16:43.794 --> 16:47.198
Now go inside
and take off those wet clothes.

16:47.298 --> 16:50.643
What I oughta do is get me a sprout
and give him one good thrashing.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.371
Take it easy, son.
He's only a little boy.

16:53.471 --> 16:56.441
Papa wouldn't want that old dog
in our drinkin' water.

16:56.557 --> 16:59.544
Papa wouldn't have started
a rock fight with Arliss either.

16:59.644 --> 17:02.920
I never started no rock fight. He...

17:04.982 --> 17:09.282
Arliss rocks me. Mama blesses me out.

17:12.448 --> 17:15.748
And you. You get off scot-free.

17:16.160 --> 17:19.539
What I oughta do is
run you clean off this place.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.367
You touch a bite of this meat,

17:31.467 --> 17:34.266
and come mornin' I'm gonna
shoot you right between the eyes.

18:47.585 --> 18:49.303
I'll be dogged.

19:04.101 --> 19:08.072
Mama? Did you
feed that old dog anything?

19:08.564 --> 19:11.467
Well, no, I forgot to.
Been so long since we had a dog.

19:11.567 --> 19:15.492
Well, he's sure gone
and rustled up some grub somewhere.

19:15.613 --> 19:18.412
He ain't touched a bite of that venison.

19:18.616 --> 19:20.768
You might know
he'd be too smart for that.

19:20.868 --> 19:23.771
You could've put it on the ground
and he wouldn't have touched it.

19:23.871 --> 19:27.608
You better get dressed if you want
an early start cuttin' fence posts.

19:27.708 --> 19:28.925
Yes'm.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.502
Come on, Yeller boy, get him!

20:13.671 --> 20:16.345
Get him, Yeller! There he is!

20:16.841 --> 20:18.809
There he goes, over there!

20:21.429 --> 20:22.521
Missed him!

20:25.933 --> 20:28.777
That's got him! Good for you, boy!

20:31.814 --> 20:36.035
Mama! Mama, look at the fish
that I caught! Ain't he a whopper?

20:36.819 --> 20:40.824
Oh, Arliss!
You're all wet and muddy again.

20:41.157 --> 20:43.660
- But, Mama, I had to.
- Had to?

20:43.826 --> 20:47.171
Had to dive way down
deep under to catch this fish.

20:47.705 --> 20:51.255
He was way down deep under
where there was this cave

20:51.375 --> 20:53.173
and it was real dark and muddy.

20:53.586 --> 20:57.323
And there's about a million other
fish and they all tried to eat me.

20:57.423 --> 20:59.408
And I had to throw rocks at 'em.

20:59.508 --> 21:02.011
And then there's
these two big snakes and...

21:02.136 --> 21:04.455
Sounds like that cottontail
you roped this mornin'.

21:04.555 --> 21:06.874
But I did rope him, didn't I, Mama?

21:06.974 --> 21:09.853
He came runnin' by,
and I roped him right by the ears.

21:10.060 --> 21:13.756
Well, you certainly brought home
a rabbit, and now this big catfish.

21:13.856 --> 21:15.779
You're gettin' to be
as good a hunter as Travis.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.135
Here, Mama.

21:18.235 --> 21:20.930
Come on, Yeller! Come on, boy!

21:21.030 --> 21:22.890
Yeah!

21:22.990 --> 21:25.768
Mama, you know them
is just big windies Arliss is tellin'.

21:25.868 --> 21:28.771
Now, Travis, let him
tell his stories the way he wants to.

21:28.871 --> 21:31.941
But, Mama, I just seen that old,
yeller dog catch this fish.

21:32.041 --> 21:34.860
Arliss is just a little boy
with a big imagination.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.779
Won't hurt him to let him use it.

21:36.879 --> 21:39.615
We keep that old, yeller dog much longer

21:39.715 --> 21:42.969
and it's gonna make
Arliss the biggest liar in Texas!

21:55.815 --> 21:58.659
Here, boy, come and get some bread.

22:01.237 --> 22:02.955
Here.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.408
Come on.

22:06.075 --> 22:08.102
A little closer.

22:08.202 --> 22:11.251
Come on. I'll give you some more bread.

22:11.497 --> 22:13.215
Come on.

22:14.041 --> 22:16.444
Come on. Come on.

22:16.944 --> 22:18.797
Come on.

22:24.484 --> 22:27.057
What's that?

22:27.304 --> 22:29.404
Come on, boy.

22:36.438 --> 22:38.048
Arliss, turn it loose!

22:38.148 --> 22:40.050
Arliss, watch out!

22:43.112 --> 22:44.580
Turn it loose!

23:08.470 --> 23:11.064
Go on, ya old fool, before she kills ya.

23:27.823 --> 23:31.202
Oh, you crazy, wonderful dog!

23:33.662 --> 23:36.791
He acts like it's a great big romp,
doesn't he, Travis?

23:37.207 --> 23:39.318
Crazy as a bull bat.

23:39.418 --> 23:42.672
But he's a heap more dog
than I ever had him figured for.

24:31.762 --> 24:35.165
Just listen to those
songbirds this mornin'...

24:35.265 --> 24:36.983
Singin' their heads off.

24:38.268 --> 24:41.171
It's like the year
your Papa and I settled here.

24:41.271 --> 24:43.966
We meant to build over
at the Salt Licks settlement

24:44.066 --> 24:46.819
where it would've been safer
from the Indians, but...

24:47.486 --> 24:52.433
That last day, we camped by the spring.

24:52.533 --> 24:55.644
And the bee myrtle was in blossom

24:55.744 --> 24:59.840
and full of singin' birds, like now.

24:59.957 --> 25:02.551
And it was all so pretty,
I just couldn't go on.

25:02.918 --> 25:07.389
And I said to your Papa,
"Jim, this is it.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.634
"This is home."

25:13.095 --> 25:14.642
Hello, the house!

25:16.098 --> 25:18.459
It's Bud Searcy and Lisbeth, too.

25:18.559 --> 25:21.278
You might know he'd land
right at mealtime.

25:22.896 --> 25:26.425
Howdy, Miss Coates. Howdy do?
Howdy, boy. How's everybody?

25:26.525 --> 25:28.510
- Hello, Mr. Searcy.
- Slide down, child.

25:28.610 --> 25:29.553
Hello, Lisbeth.

25:29.653 --> 25:32.264
Just dropped over to see
if there's anything I could do.

25:32.364 --> 25:35.726
Travis, take this pony to the corn crib
and strip the saddle gear off him.

25:35.826 --> 25:38.771
- Yes, Mr. Searcy.
- Might feed him a bit of corn

25:38.871 --> 25:40.481
while you're at it, boy.

25:40.581 --> 25:41.857
Won't you come and set a while?

25:41.957 --> 25:44.652
Well, I believe I will shade
up for a spell, Miss Coates.

25:44.752 --> 25:47.029
Come on, Lisbeth. Hot, ain't it?

25:47.129 --> 25:50.199
We don't get some rain pretty soon,
this country's gonna burn up bad.

25:50.299 --> 25:53.077
Corn crop ain't gonna be worth nothin'
more than a whirlwind nubbins.

25:53.177 --> 25:57.648
Some folks'll be scrapin' the bottom of
their meal barrels come wintertime.

26:00.267 --> 26:02.002
This here's hanged too long.

26:02.102 --> 26:03.420
Lisbeth, honey, run down to the spring

26:03.520 --> 26:06.069
and fetch your poor old pappy
a bucket of fresh water.

26:07.649 --> 26:10.260
I'll tell you, Miss Coates...

26:10.360 --> 26:13.055
It's a heavy responsibility
ridin' herd on the settlement

26:13.155 --> 26:15.224
while the menfolks is gone.

26:15.324 --> 26:17.184
Wears a man right down to a frazzle.

26:17.284 --> 26:18.560
But I ain't complainin', though.

26:18.660 --> 26:21.834
I was chose for this job
and I'll get her done.

26:24.625 --> 26:28.153
I, kinda figured to head up
that cow drive to Kansas myself.

26:28.253 --> 26:30.572
But when man after man
called me all spoke private like...

26:30.672 --> 26:31.907
Beggin' me to stay behind,

26:32.007 --> 26:34.760
look after you womenfolks
and the young ones, I seen my duty.

26:35.094 --> 26:37.538
Knowed I was bein' called on
for a bigger job.

26:37.638 --> 26:39.748
Jim said you were gonna protect us all.

26:39.848 --> 26:42.960
Mighty lucky thing I done it, too.
Know what happened the other day?

26:43.060 --> 26:44.294
That fool kid of Jed Simpson's

26:44.394 --> 26:46.171
shot at a bunch of javelina hogs
and wounded one of 'em.

26:46.271 --> 26:50.092
Set it too squealin'. Ha! Be dogged
that the rest of them didn't tree that boy.

26:50.192 --> 26:53.412
Kept him up there too till I happened
along and seed what a pickle he was in.

26:54.113 --> 26:57.391
Of course I couldn't chase
them pesky javelinas off.

26:57.491 --> 27:00.978
But I did go tell that boy's Mama where
he was, so she could rest easy

27:01.078 --> 27:04.173
till the varmints left out
and give him a chance to climb down.

27:07.876 --> 27:10.612
Yep. Lookin' out after you womenfolks

27:10.712 --> 27:13.431
and the young ones
sure keeps a man a-hoppin' around.

27:14.675 --> 27:16.368
Biggest bother I've had, though, lately

27:16.468 --> 27:18.620
is the thievin' what's been
goin' on at Salt Licks.

27:20.013 --> 27:23.625
Meat stole out of smoke houses.
Hen's nests gettin' robbed.

27:23.725 --> 27:26.795
- Mama, I'm hung...
- Hush, baby. Mr. Searcy's talkin'.

27:26.895 --> 27:30.257
Womenfolks losin' bread what they
set out in their windows to cool.

27:30.357 --> 27:33.802
- Sounds like some varmint.
- There ain't no varmint that clever, boy.

27:33.902 --> 27:34.845
Mama, I'm hungry.

27:34.945 --> 27:36.346
- When we gonna ea...
- Arliss.

27:36.446 --> 27:39.349
I told you, don't butt in.
Mr. Searcy's talkin'.

27:40.149 --> 27:42.393
That's all right, Miss Coates.

27:42.786 --> 27:45.665
Ain't nothin' like a little old boy
to know when it's time to eat.

27:49.042 --> 27:52.279
Well, I guess it is gettin'
on toward dinnertime.

27:52.379 --> 27:55.657
Travis, will you go down to the corn
patch and pick us some roastin' ears?

27:55.757 --> 27:59.432
Now, just a minute, Miss Coates.
That boy need help to tote all that corn.

27:59.720 --> 28:01.438
Yes, sir.

28:02.847 --> 28:05.646
Lisbeth, go along with Travis.

28:06.810 --> 28:10.440
Be sure you pick out ears
what is sweet and juicy.

28:22.951 --> 28:27.064
Why, coons been in this corn!
Them thievin' rascals!

28:27.164 --> 28:29.650
You'll have to take to
doggin' 'em overnight.

28:29.750 --> 28:31.485
I got me just the dog for it.

28:31.585 --> 28:34.259
Old Yeller will wipe up the ground
with them pesky varmints.

28:36.340 --> 28:38.200
You think he can't do it?

28:38.300 --> 28:41.578
Oh, no. It... It ain't that.

28:41.678 --> 28:45.182
Well, I didn't wanna
tell you at the house, but...

28:46.141 --> 28:48.064
It was him what done it.

28:48.477 --> 28:49.729
What done what?

28:50.312 --> 28:54.033
What stole all them eggs
and bread and meat and stuff.

28:54.650 --> 28:56.573
You mean Old Yeller?

28:57.152 --> 28:59.621
I seen him suck a batch of eggs.

29:00.656 --> 29:04.206
Seen him swipe a pan of
Grandma's corn bread too.

29:05.744 --> 29:08.998
- But I ain't gonna tell.
- I bet you do.

29:09.206 --> 29:10.649
No, I won't.

29:10.749 --> 29:14.219
Wasn't goin' to even before
I knowed he was your dog.

29:14.670 --> 29:15.717
How come?

29:16.088 --> 29:18.307
Because Miss Priss is gonna have pups.

29:18.590 --> 29:21.309
Your dog'll be their papa.

29:21.510 --> 29:24.514
And I wouldn't want him
to get shot for stealin'.

29:32.437 --> 29:35.632
Just an old arrowhead I picked up.

29:35.732 --> 29:37.985
Comanche, Papa said.

29:39.653 --> 29:41.701
Well, you can have it.

29:43.073 --> 29:46.043
I won't never, never tell.

29:46.868 --> 29:49.938
When you git right down to hogs,
just about the best eatin' there is alive.

29:50.038 --> 29:53.025
And I reckon just about the meanest
critter alive go after his meat.

29:53.125 --> 29:55.485
Cut you 14 different ways
before you can get fixed to rot.

29:55.585 --> 29:56.862
They scare me to death.

29:56.962 --> 29:59.385
Always dread the time when Jim
comes to do the markin'.

29:59.715 --> 30:03.619
Yep, hogs is bad, mighty bad. I had me
an uncle once down in east Texas,

30:03.719 --> 30:06.455
tangled a bad hog, he did.
Got cut all to pieces.

30:06.555 --> 30:07.852
Kill him?

30:08.557 --> 30:11.126
Kill him? Why, it killed him
deader than a doornail.

30:11.226 --> 30:14.504
Mr. Searcy, I roped me a rabbit once.

30:14.604 --> 30:16.732
Arliss, be quiet. Mr. Searcy's talkin'.

30:16.898 --> 30:20.118
Well, I did. A mean old bitin' one.

30:22.904 --> 30:26.000
Well now, boy,
that's really doin' some ropin'.

30:29.036 --> 30:31.396
You know, speakin' of ropin', I always
done my hog work from up a tree.

30:31.496 --> 30:32.748
Heap safer that way.

30:33.123 --> 30:35.046
How can you work hogs from a tree?

30:35.292 --> 30:38.153
Why, it's strict as a whistle, boy.

30:38.253 --> 30:40.906
Pick you out a tree with a low
hanging limb, but still out of hog reach.

30:41.006 --> 30:43.325
Get your dog to rally
them hogs around the tree.

30:43.425 --> 30:46.099
Reach down your loop,
pull up your pig and go to work on him.

30:46.303 --> 30:48.431
By golly!
That sounds like it might work.

30:48.597 --> 30:50.457
Work? Why, of course it works!

30:50.557 --> 30:53.835
Them old hogs can fuss and charge
around all they please, but up a tree

30:53.935 --> 30:56.108
you're as safe as at home in bed.

31:05.030 --> 31:10.477
Travis, boy, you go fetch my pony,
and we'll be pullin' out for home.

31:10.577 --> 31:13.501
I've got a powerful lot to do
before supper time.

31:20.962 --> 31:23.431
It was right neighborly like
of you to feed us, Miss Coates.

31:24.132 --> 31:26.535
Now, don't you fret yourself at all
while your man's gone.

31:26.635 --> 31:30.372
We'll be lookin' in on you again before
you know it. Bye, boy. Bye, Miss Coates.

31:30.472 --> 31:32.019
Bye, Lisbeth.

31:32.516 --> 31:33.813
Bye.

31:36.144 --> 31:39.990
No wonder they don't want him
on no cow drive.

31:40.816 --> 31:44.636
By the time he finished eatin' and visitin'
with everyone this side of Abilene,

31:44.736 --> 31:47.514
them cows would be dead of old age.

31:47.614 --> 31:50.058
Mama, Lisbeth says it's Old Yeller

31:50.158 --> 31:53.228
what's been doin'
all that stealin' out in Salt Licks.

31:53.328 --> 31:55.272
Claimed she catched him at it.

31:55.372 --> 31:58.692
Why, the old rogue.
We'll have to break him of that,

31:58.792 --> 32:01.403
or else everyone
in Salt Licks'll be mad at us.

32:01.503 --> 32:04.614
Somebody'll shoot him! Yeller!

32:05.714 --> 32:07.763
Come here!

32:09.886 --> 32:12.639
You old rascal. You been stealin'!

32:12.973 --> 32:15.584
Maybe we better
take to pennin' him overnight.

32:15.684 --> 32:18.503
I reckon we won't
have to bother for a while.

32:18.603 --> 32:23.008
Listen! I'm gonna keep you
so dang busted busy

32:23.108 --> 32:25.531
you won't have time to go off prowlin'!

32:29.281 --> 32:31.329
No, you don't!

32:40.333 --> 32:44.554
We're stayin' right here and
keepin' them coons run out, you hear?

32:48.550 --> 32:50.848
Look at all them stars, Yeller.

32:52.053 --> 32:53.771
Bushels of 'em.

32:56.516 --> 32:59.044
I wonder if maybe Papa's lying out there

32:59.144 --> 33:03.320
on the trail somewhere,
lookin' at 'em, too.

33:04.483 --> 33:06.861
I wish I was with him,

33:07.652 --> 33:09.763
way off yonder,

33:09.863 --> 33:12.241
up in Kansas...

33:14.075 --> 33:16.169
Seein' all that...

33:16.578 --> 33:18.000
Big...

33:19.915 --> 33:22.043
Country.

34:29.400 --> 34:31.496
Get 'em, Yeller!

34:33.280 --> 34:35.973
Get 'em, Yeller!
Wipe up the ground with 'em!

34:53.049 --> 34:55.552
Yeller sure has been givin'
them coons the mortal fits.

34:56.719 --> 34:58.747
- You tired, son?
- No, ma'am.

35:01.391 --> 35:03.564
Where's Old Rose?

35:04.436 --> 35:05.629
She didn't come up last night.

35:05.729 --> 35:08.757
I figured she hid out somewhere
and had her calf.

35:08.857 --> 35:10.700
I guess I better go hunt her up.

35:12.694 --> 35:14.571
Come on, Yeller.

35:15.905 --> 35:19.876
Remember now, if she's had her calf,
she'll be on the fight.

35:57.304 --> 35:59.228
Come on, Yeller!

36:25.892 --> 36:27.986
Quiet, Yeller! Don't rile her!

37:05.265 --> 37:07.314
That's gettin' her, boy!

37:08.810 --> 37:10.278
Get her, Yeller! Bust her again!

37:21.448 --> 37:25.169
Try it again, sister,
and Old Yeller'll bust you wide open.

37:34.085 --> 37:37.055
All right, Yeller, get her home.

37:59.360 --> 38:01.513
All right, old sister, you take it easy.

38:01.613 --> 38:05.538
I aim to milk you if I have to
break every bone in your body.

38:05.700 --> 38:10.001
So now, Rose, you know
as well as I we're not gonna hurt ya.

38:15.376 --> 38:18.050
Now, Rose, you take it easy.

38:20.256 --> 38:22.492
You ain't got a chance, sister.

38:22.592 --> 38:25.141
You're done milked
and you don't know it.

38:30.517 --> 38:32.110
I know what!

38:34.187 --> 38:35.905
Here, Yeller.

38:36.689 --> 38:40.114
Son, you bring that dog in here
and Rose will go crazy.

38:40.235 --> 38:41.987
All right, Yeller, hold her there.

39:22.193 --> 39:26.289
Well, if that don't beat all.
I never saw such a dog.

39:27.282 --> 39:29.410
And you won't never see
another one like him.

39:36.958 --> 39:39.131
Hello, the house!

39:41.629 --> 39:43.882
I thought maybe it was Papa.

39:45.967 --> 39:50.371
Mornin', ma'am. I'm Burn Sanderson
from down near San 'Tone.

39:50.471 --> 39:52.791
Runnin' me a few head
of cattle over on Devil's Creek.

39:52.891 --> 39:54.334
Yes, Mr. Sanderson?

39:54.434 --> 39:57.670
Bud Searcy told me about an old,
stray dog you had.

39:57.770 --> 40:00.649
Sounded like it might be the one I lost.

40:01.816 --> 40:04.365
You mean a... Big, yeller dog?

40:04.652 --> 40:05.887
That's him all right.

40:05.987 --> 40:08.615
The worst egg-sucker
and camp-robber you ever laid eyes on.

40:08.823 --> 40:10.642
Steal you blind while you're watchin'.

40:10.742 --> 40:15.122
But there never was a better
cow dog born, or a hog dog either.

40:16.831 --> 40:19.505
Travis, go call Old Yeller to the house.

40:19.792 --> 40:21.635
- But, Mama...
- Travis!

40:22.670 --> 40:23.887
Yes, Mama.

40:29.218 --> 40:30.870
Won't you get down, Mr. Sanderson?

40:30.970 --> 40:32.847
Thank you, ma'am.

40:39.020 --> 40:40.567
Arliss.

40:43.149 --> 40:45.927
- What do you want?
- Bring Old Yeller to the house.

40:46.027 --> 40:49.076
- What's the matter?
- You'll find out.

40:54.869 --> 40:59.232
Ma'am, you and the boys
don't have much protection out here.

40:59.332 --> 41:01.693
Bad as I need that old dog,
I could give you a loan of him

41:01.793 --> 41:03.403
till your man comes home.

41:05.603 --> 41:09.784
No, Mr. Sanderson. If he's
your dog, better take him now.

41:09.884 --> 41:11.682
Well, maybe you're right, ma'am.

41:12.929 --> 41:14.727
Come on, boy.

41:16.490 --> 41:18.643
Why, you prowlin' old rascal.

41:21.031 --> 41:22.831
Come on, boy.

41:27.276 --> 41:30.075
Well, good-bye, ma'am.
I'm sure much obliged.

41:33.574 --> 41:35.167
Come on, Yeller.

41:36.577 --> 41:40.172
That's my dog! You can't take my dog!

41:42.250 --> 41:45.129
You can't take my dog!
You can't take my dog!

41:45.420 --> 41:47.798
- Whoa, boy!
- You can't take my dog!

41:51.718 --> 41:54.495
Arliss, aren't you ashamed,
throwin' rocks at that man?

41:54.595 --> 41:57.832
I'll bust him with another
if he takes my dog off!

41:57.932 --> 41:59.083
Arliss!

42:01.477 --> 42:03.004
Maybe he's right, ma'am.

42:03.104 --> 42:06.199
Man comes to take my dog off,
I'd throw a fit too.

42:06.649 --> 42:08.777
Let me talk to this boy a minute.

42:12.613 --> 42:13.705
Well, boy?

42:16.034 --> 42:17.286
Go on, Arliss.

42:19.328 --> 42:20.454
Go on.

42:43.936 --> 42:45.688
Whatcha got in that pocket?

42:46.439 --> 42:48.157
Come on. Let's take a look.

42:54.030 --> 42:56.516
Why, ain't he a jim-dandy.

42:56.616 --> 43:00.337
- Finest lookin' horned toad I ever seen.
- What about my dog?

43:00.661 --> 43:03.585
You mean you really want
that thievin', old, yeller dog?

43:03.998 --> 43:05.466
I sure do.

43:05.792 --> 43:07.735
Well, then maybe we can
do some swappin'.

43:07.835 --> 43:11.465
I've been wantin' mighty bad to get me
a big horned toad like you got there.

43:11.839 --> 43:15.184
You mean you'd swap me Old Yeller
for this here horny toad?

43:15.718 --> 43:19.455
Well, now, that's a fine horny toad,
and I want him bad.

43:19.555 --> 43:21.933
But on the other hand,
he ain't hardly as big as a dog.

43:22.892 --> 43:26.237
- Seems like I oughta get a little to boot.
- Like what?

43:26.604 --> 43:28.948
Well, I'll tell you how it is.

43:31.025 --> 43:34.178
I've been in that cow camp
starvin' on my own cookin' so long,

43:34.278 --> 43:36.431
I don't hardly throw a shadow no more.

43:36.531 --> 43:39.767
Now, if you could talk your mama

43:39.867 --> 43:43.246
into feedin' me one,
big woman-cooked meal,

43:43.830 --> 43:46.274
why, I figure it and that
horned toad would be worth

43:46.374 --> 43:50.345
at least a lop-eared Yeller dog,
don't you?

43:54.048 --> 43:56.221
Well, I guess so.

43:56.843 --> 43:58.390
Will you feed him, Mama?

43:59.679 --> 44:01.352
Of course I will.

44:02.640 --> 44:05.393
All right, I'll swap ya.

44:05.768 --> 44:06.860
Here, boy!

44:08.896 --> 44:10.739
He's all yours, boy.

44:12.400 --> 44:14.302
Come on, Yeller. Come on, boy.

44:14.402 --> 44:17.406
Hey. What about my toad?

44:25.663 --> 44:27.482
Come on, boy.

44:27.582 --> 44:29.108
Come on.

44:39.260 --> 44:40.661
I haven't ate like this...

44:40.761 --> 44:44.540
Since the time I splurged on a big feed
at the Menger Hotel in San 'Tone.

44:44.640 --> 44:47.418
Well, I'm happy you enjoyed it,
Mr. Sanderson.

44:47.518 --> 44:50.296
Well, ma'am, I guess
I better be gettin' back to camp.

44:50.396 --> 44:51.672
Come with me, boy,
while I get my horse settled.

44:51.772 --> 44:52.799
Yes, sir.

44:52.899 --> 44:55.676
When Mr. Coates gets back,
I want you to come and see us.

44:55.776 --> 44:56.969
I want him to meet ya.

44:57.069 --> 45:00.118
That's mighty nice of ya, ma'am.
Thank you.

45:01.866 --> 45:04.619
Good-bye, boy.
Take good care of that old, yeller dog.

45:04.869 --> 45:08.043
Yes, sir. And you take care
of my horny toad.

45:08.539 --> 45:10.233
I will. Bye, ma'am.

45:10.333 --> 45:12.210
Good-bye.

45:19.467 --> 45:22.870
Didn't tell your Mama this.
Didn't want to fret her.

45:22.970 --> 45:25.206
But there's a plague of hydrophobia
in these parts.

45:25.306 --> 45:27.375
Hydrophobia? You sure?

45:27.475 --> 45:31.400
I've done shot two wolves,
a fox and a skunk that had it.

45:32.355 --> 45:35.074
I wanted to warn you
not to take any chances.

45:38.736 --> 45:42.515
Well, I don't know if I could tell
if a critter's got the sickness.

45:42.615 --> 45:44.725
You can't hardly tell at first.

45:44.825 --> 45:48.329
Not until they get to the point
of slobberin' and staggerin' around.

45:48.829 --> 45:51.753
You see a critter in that fix,
you know for sure.

45:53.084 --> 45:55.653
But you wanna watch
for others that ain't that far along.

45:55.753 --> 45:58.114
Now you take a bobcat and a fox...

45:58.214 --> 46:00.908
You know they'll run
if they get the chance.

46:01.008 --> 46:04.036
But when one don't run,
or maybe makes fight at you,

46:04.136 --> 46:06.289
why, you shoot him and quick.

46:06.389 --> 46:08.983
After he's bitten you, it's too late.

46:12.061 --> 46:14.213
You done with your
hog markin' for this year?

46:14.313 --> 46:16.340
No. I'm aimin' to start tomorrow.

46:16.440 --> 46:18.659
You watch them hogs same as everything.

46:19.402 --> 46:22.263
I know your papa left you
in charge of things while he's gone.

46:22.363 --> 46:24.866
And I figure you're
man enough to handle the job.

46:26.701 --> 46:28.044
Don't scare you, does it, boy?

46:28.286 --> 46:29.987
No, sir.

46:30.087 --> 46:31.606
Well, yes, sir,

46:31.706 --> 46:35.193
it scares me a little bit,
but I'll sure do like you told me.

46:35.293 --> 46:37.546
That's a way a man talks, son.

47:13.873 --> 47:16.592
Hog tracks, Yeller! Get 'em, boy!

48:12.184 --> 48:14.638
Hold 'em, boy!

48:44.672 --> 48:47.471
All right, Yeller.
Fetch 'em right under here.

49:42.438 --> 49:47.009
Over bit the right ear.
Under slope the left.

49:47.109 --> 49:50.579
All right, pig,
now you're wearin' the Coates' mark.

49:51.113 --> 49:52.456
Easy.

50:10.883 --> 50:12.556
Whoa-ooo!

50:29.610 --> 50:31.863
Yeller! Yeller!

51:03.227 --> 51:04.979
Yeller.

51:09.483 --> 51:11.156
Yeller!

51:20.911 --> 51:23.209
Oh, Yeller.

51:25.749 --> 51:29.970
Oh, Yeller. You're all cut to pieces.

51:30.862 --> 51:33.449
You're gonna be all right, ya hear?

51:33.549 --> 51:37.304
I'll get Mama.
Mama'll fix you up for sure.

52:05.122 --> 52:08.296
Come on, boy. Gonna put you in here.

52:11.754 --> 52:15.475
Come on, Yeller. Want them hogs
to come back and get ya?

52:41.825 --> 52:44.078
You gotta stay here till I get back.

52:57.841 --> 53:00.619
I mean it, boy. I'm comin' back.

53:00.719 --> 53:02.642
I promise.

53:14.400 --> 53:16.343
Come on now.

53:16.443 --> 53:18.178
I'll help you to bed.

53:18.278 --> 53:20.055
Mama, we gotta go back after Old Yeller.

53:20.155 --> 53:24.935
You're not goin' any place until that leg
gets well. I've doctored hog cuts before.

53:25.035 --> 53:28.209
This one of yours could be as
dangerous as a rattlesnake bite.

53:28.789 --> 53:33.420
Mama, you don't understand.
I promised Old Yeller, and I'm goin'!

53:34.128 --> 53:35.596
Travis!

53:36.130 --> 53:38.032
- Travis!
- I aim to go after Old Yeller.

53:38.132 --> 53:39.679
He'll die without help!

53:44.096 --> 53:46.269
All right, then. We'll all go.

54:07.453 --> 54:09.922
Mama, them buzzards ain't got him!

54:25.512 --> 54:29.166
What's a matter with Yeller, Mama?
Who stopped him up in this hole?

54:29.266 --> 54:31.460
We've come to get him out, baby.

54:31.560 --> 54:34.171
But first, I wonder if you'd
do somethin' for me.

54:34.271 --> 54:37.216
- What?
- Go catch me a green-striped lizard.

54:37.316 --> 54:40.052
We passed one back there a piece.
Prettiest I ever saw.

54:40.152 --> 54:42.325
Sure, Mama. I'll catch him.

54:43.614 --> 54:46.308
We're gonna have to hurry
if we wanna get him patched up

54:46.408 --> 54:48.376
before Arliss gets back.

54:58.003 --> 54:59.630
Oh, Travis.

55:00.798 --> 55:03.242
I didn't know it was gonna be this bad.

55:03.342 --> 55:05.452
Them hogs would've never touched him.

55:05.552 --> 55:08.226
He was keepin' 'em off of me.

55:08.931 --> 55:10.624
We'll have to sew him up.

55:10.724 --> 55:13.853
Go jerk me a hair
out of Old Jumper's tail.

55:54.017 --> 55:56.486
Yes, Yeller.

56:03.527 --> 56:08.203
Take your ax and go cut
two long poles for a litter.

56:08.574 --> 56:11.293
The sooner we get him home, the better.

56:17.749 --> 56:20.753
Mama, I got your lizard.

56:22.629 --> 56:25.991
- Ain't he pretty?
- Ooh, yes. He really is.

56:26.091 --> 56:29.995
Now if you'll just keep him for me until
we get home. We're gonna play a game.

56:30.095 --> 56:33.749
- What kind of a game?
- We're playin' Old Yeller is sick.

56:33.849 --> 56:37.002
- You're gonna take care of him.
- Is that why he's all wrapped up?

56:37.102 --> 56:40.881
That's right. Now, you're gonna
ride here and hold him.

56:40.981 --> 56:42.824
Like we was two sick injuns?

56:43.400 --> 56:45.152
And you make sure he don't fall off.

56:45.277 --> 56:47.930
On account of
he's a sicker Injun than me?

56:48.030 --> 56:49.890
That's right. Now remember,

56:49.990 --> 56:52.100
don't lean on him
and don't play with him.

56:52.200 --> 56:53.952
He's a very, very sick Indian.

57:06.632 --> 57:08.851
Come on, Jumper.

57:26.401 --> 57:28.199
Mama?

57:28.737 --> 57:31.348
Them prickly pear roots
gonna make Travis well?

57:31.448 --> 57:33.058
I hope so, son.

57:33.158 --> 57:35.394
Mama?

57:35.494 --> 57:38.272
When you're done, will you play with me?

57:38.372 --> 57:40.716
I'm sorry, Arliss. I'm too busy now.

57:41.041 --> 57:43.385
You go out in the backyard and play.

57:43.710 --> 57:48.341
But I tell you, there ain't nothin'
to do out in that old backyard.

57:50.384 --> 57:52.995
Now, Arliss, you stop it,
and go outside this minute.

57:53.095 --> 57:55.289
Hello, the house!

57:55.389 --> 57:57.391
It's Mr. Searcy!

58:01.728 --> 58:03.947
Ain't he pretty? Is he for me?

58:04.189 --> 58:06.842
Partly. Mostly he's for Travis.

58:06.942 --> 58:10.679
But Travis can't play with no puppy.
He's sick.

58:10.779 --> 58:14.079
- Sick?
- Him and Old Yeller. Hog cut.

58:15.534 --> 58:18.228
Good mornin', Mr. Searcy.
Hello, Lisbeth.

58:18.328 --> 58:20.314
What's this about that boy of yours
gettin' hog cut?

58:20.414 --> 58:22.900
- Whatcha doctorin' with?
- Prickly pear root.

58:23.000 --> 58:26.425
Miss Coates, I brung somethin'
for Travis. Can I take it to him?

58:26.670 --> 58:28.113
Go right in there, honey.

58:28.213 --> 58:31.199
Now if you'll excuse me, Mr. Searcy,
I'm makin' up some new poultice.

58:31.299 --> 58:33.327
You know, it's right providential
I come along when I did.

58:33.427 --> 58:35.245
'Tain't nothin' better
than a prickly pear poultice,

58:35.345 --> 58:37.268
providin' a body knows how to fix it.

58:38.098 --> 58:40.000
You hurt pretty bad?

58:40.100 --> 58:43.604
I'm all right. It'd take more
than them old hogs to kill me.

58:44.396 --> 58:48.175
Well, I... I brung you a surprise.

58:48.275 --> 58:49.948
One of Miss Priss' pups.

58:51.194 --> 58:55.119
Thems was born in a badger hole.
Seven of 'em.

58:55.699 --> 58:58.168
This 'un's the best of the bunch.

58:59.411 --> 59:03.712
See? He don't holler
when you hold him up by the neck hide.

59:04.624 --> 59:06.818
Papa says that means he's a good dog.

59:06.918 --> 59:08.612
That don't mean nothin'.

59:08.712 --> 59:11.841
If his mouth's black inside,
that's what counts.

59:19.097 --> 59:21.475
Well, anyhow, I...

59:22.267 --> 59:24.144
I brung him to ya.

59:24.478 --> 59:27.527
Well, I got me a dog. Old Yeller.

59:36.990 --> 59:39.459
Well, why don't you give him to Arliss?
He'll like him.

59:51.171 --> 59:53.198
Here, you can have him.

59:53.298 --> 59:55.141
Golly!

59:56.218 --> 01:00:00.330
- Golly!
- That's the secret, Miss Coates,

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:02.374
a-beatin' them roots
till they're all soft and squishy...

01:00:02.474 --> 01:00:06.445
Mama, look at the little,
bitty puppy Lisbeth give me.

01:00:13.068 --> 01:00:14.240
Oh.

01:00:14.736 --> 01:00:16.722
Sure cut up, ain't ya, boy?

01:00:16.822 --> 01:00:19.266
Clean to the bone, looks like.

01:00:19.366 --> 01:00:22.227
That there poultice is sure the stuff
to suck out the poison,

01:00:22.327 --> 01:00:23.937
provided, of course,
he ain't got hydrophoby.

01:00:24.037 --> 01:00:26.398
- "Hydrophoby"?
- Could be. It's all over the countryside.

01:00:26.498 --> 01:00:29.401
Stuff dyin' like flies.
Foxes, wolves, polecats, hogs...

01:00:29.501 --> 01:00:31.111
- Hogs?
- Hogs can get it.

01:00:31.211 --> 01:00:33.555
Same as that there boy
or that old, yeller dog there.

01:00:34.381 --> 01:00:36.867
Seen either one of them foamin'
at the mouth, shown any signs of fits?

01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:38.952
- Fits of temper?
- Of course not!

01:00:39.052 --> 01:00:41.955
Well, you better keep a close watch
on them. Liable to show up at any time.

01:00:42.055 --> 01:00:44.499
Recollect had me an uncle once
down in east Texas.

01:00:44.599 --> 01:00:46.293
Got mad dog bit, he did.

01:00:46.393 --> 01:00:49.296
Knowed he was bound to die.
Chained himself to a sweet gum tree.

01:00:49.396 --> 01:00:50.797
Stayed right there
till sickness took ahold.

01:00:50.897 --> 01:00:52.049
Mr. Searcy, please.

01:00:52.149 --> 01:00:53.717
But it's the gospel truth, Miss Coates!

01:00:53.817 --> 01:00:55.427
He went to snarlin' and snappin'
at everything in sight.

01:00:55.527 --> 01:00:56.970
He run at his woman
and young 'uns, tryin' to bite 'em.

01:00:57.070 --> 01:01:00.244
He'd have done it too
if that chain hadn't held him back.

01:01:01.074 --> 01:01:03.577
Stayed right there
till he died of the slobberin' fits.

01:01:03.869 --> 01:01:04.978
They buried him
under that sweet gum tree...

01:01:05.078 --> 01:01:07.522
Mr. Searcy, that's enough!
Not another word!

01:01:07.622 --> 01:01:08.919
Biggest, nicest funeral you ever did...

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:15.697
What do you mean,
tellin' an ugly story like that

01:01:15.797 --> 01:01:17.324
to a boy who's just been hog cut?

01:01:17.424 --> 01:01:20.410
Now, Miss Coates, I was just
tryin' to give a word of warnin'.

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:22.579
Reckon if I can't be
of no more help around here,

01:01:22.679 --> 01:01:23.997
I'll be makin' tracks for home.

01:01:24.097 --> 01:01:26.833
Help. There are plenty of ways
a man could help around here.

01:01:26.933 --> 01:01:29.086
By doin' what, Miss Coates?

01:01:29.186 --> 01:01:31.630
Like hitchin' up the mule
and gatherin' in the corn crop

01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:34.674
before the deer eat it up,
or the blowin' rain rot it in the field!

01:01:34.774 --> 01:01:37.511
Now, don't you fret yourself
at all about that corn crop, Miss Coates.

01:01:37.611 --> 01:01:39.534
I'll be glad to take care
of that. Lisbeth?

01:01:40.447 --> 01:01:41.890
Yes, Papa?

01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:44.226
Lisbeth, honey, Miss Coates here,
she's in kind of a bind.

01:01:44.326 --> 01:01:45.769
Ain't got her corn in the crib yet.

01:01:45.869 --> 01:01:48.522
Figured I'll leave you behind
to help her with the job.

01:01:48.622 --> 01:01:52.484
Mr. Searcy, Lisbeth's nothin'
but a little girl.

01:01:52.584 --> 01:01:54.569
Yeah, well, she ain't much for size,

01:01:54.669 --> 01:01:56.696
but she's just like her old pappy...
Stout and willin'!

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:04.538
Now, don't you forget, Miss Coates.
If there's any other thing I can do for you,

01:02:04.638 --> 01:02:07.082
don't you be bashful about tellin' me.

01:02:07.182 --> 01:02:09.150
I'm on call day or night.

01:02:10.185 --> 01:02:12.153
Bye! Bye.

01:02:14.814 --> 01:02:16.566
Oh!

01:02:35.961 --> 01:02:37.904
I do believe you are cooler.

01:02:38.004 --> 01:02:41.867
Mama, don't let
what Mr. Searcy said bother you.

01:02:41.967 --> 01:02:43.219
I'm gonna be all right!

01:02:44.678 --> 01:02:46.396
I'm sure you will be.

01:02:46.846 --> 01:02:50.250
I know, Mama. Mama, I know.

01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:52.586
I got a good look at them hogs.

01:02:52.686 --> 01:02:55.881
Now, them hogs was mean,
but they weren't mad.

01:03:11.997 --> 01:03:15.342
Travis, we got lots of corn.
Me, Mama and Lisbeth.

01:03:16.918 --> 01:03:19.613
Ain't that Old Rose I hear bawlin'?

01:03:19.713 --> 01:03:23.308
She's been actin' flighty lately,
like she was scared of her own shadow.

01:03:23.758 --> 01:03:26.328
And this mornin' she wouldn't
let her calf suckle neither.

01:03:26.428 --> 01:03:28.455
I think, maybe,
she's got a bit of pea vine.

01:03:28.555 --> 01:03:30.916
No, Mama, it can't be pea vine.
Not this late in the year.

01:03:38.356 --> 01:03:40.300
Oh.

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.744
The poor thing.

01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:46.073
She's blind sick.

01:03:51.077 --> 01:03:54.648
Mama, that cow's got hydrophoby.

01:03:54.748 --> 01:03:57.525
Hydrophoby? Oh, no, Travis.

01:03:57.625 --> 01:04:01.630
Mr. Sanderson said when they stagger
and slobber around, you know for sure.

01:04:07.844 --> 01:04:10.097
I'll go get my gun.

01:04:48.093 --> 01:04:50.578
Let's get finished
and go burn the carcass.

01:04:50.678 --> 01:04:54.399
If the varmints get at it,
could be that might spread the disease.

01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:20.424
I'm hungry.

01:05:20.875 --> 01:05:23.862
Well, I'll go rustle you up
some bread and milk.

01:05:23.962 --> 01:05:27.407
- How come you shot Old Rose?
- She was sick.

01:05:27.507 --> 01:05:30.535
Well, you were sick too.
How come they didn't shoot you?

01:05:30.635 --> 01:05:32.808
Well, that's somethin' different.

01:05:33.179 --> 01:05:35.415
Where'll Rose go now she's dead?

01:05:35.515 --> 01:05:37.792
Nowhere, I reckon. She's just dead.

01:05:37.892 --> 01:05:41.504
- Will she go to heaven?
- I don't much reckon.

01:05:41.604 --> 01:05:45.654
Ain't there no cows in heaven
for the angels to milk?

01:05:46.359 --> 01:05:48.011
Well, how do I know?

01:05:48.111 --> 01:05:49.704
Here's your supper.

01:05:59.706 --> 01:06:01.879
How fer off is heaven?

01:06:03.084 --> 01:06:05.803
Oh, I don't know. A fer piece, I guess.

01:06:08.381 --> 01:06:10.725
Is heaven as far off as Papa went?

01:06:13.142 --> 01:06:15.441
A heap further than that.

01:06:17.223 --> 01:06:20.397
- Where'd Papa go to?
- Kansas.

01:06:22.061 --> 01:06:24.655
Arliss, quit eatin'
with that nasty old pup!

01:06:24.772 --> 01:06:26.740
Well, he's hungry too!

01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:31.033
Travis! Bring your gun!

01:06:31.404 --> 01:06:33.348
That's Mama! What's the matter with her?

01:06:33.448 --> 01:06:35.725
You stay in this house,
Arliss, you hear?

01:06:35.825 --> 01:06:38.123
Travis! Travis!

01:06:38.912 --> 01:06:41.961
Travis! Bring your gun!

01:06:43.374 --> 01:06:47.095
Travis! Travis! A wolf!

01:07:46.312 --> 01:07:48.006
Mama!

01:07:48.106 --> 01:07:51.861
- Don't let Arliss come down here.
- I'm comin', Arliss!

01:07:53.528 --> 01:07:56.806
- What happened?
- It was so sudden, I don't hardly know.

01:07:56.906 --> 01:08:00.661
- The wolf came leapin' out at us.
- Lucky you had Old Yeller.

01:08:22.348 --> 01:08:26.148
It was lucky for us, son,
but it weren't lucky for Old Yeller.

01:08:26.769 --> 01:08:29.192
He's chewed up some,
but he ain't bad hurt.

01:08:30.939 --> 01:08:33.885
No wolf in his right mind
would've jumped us at the fire,

01:08:33.984 --> 01:08:35.237
not even a loafer wolf.

01:08:36.613 --> 01:08:38.615
That wolf was mad.

01:08:43.368 --> 01:08:46.272
I'll... Shoot him...

01:08:46.372 --> 01:08:48.215
If you can't.

01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:53.220
But either way, we've got it to do.

01:08:55.381 --> 01:08:57.033
Mama, listen.

01:08:57.133 --> 01:09:00.078
Old Yeller just saved your life,
and Lisbeth's too!

01:09:00.178 --> 01:09:02.830
And he saved mine and Arliss'! We can't!

01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:05.058
We don't know for certain.

01:09:06.934 --> 01:09:09.733
I'll pen him up where he can't get out.
And then we'll wait.

01:09:11.731 --> 01:09:13.383
We can't just shoot him
like he was nothin'.

01:09:13.483 --> 01:09:15.281
Don't you understand?

01:09:18.321 --> 01:09:20.848
All right, son.

01:09:20.948 --> 01:09:23.667
If you think there's a chance.

01:09:28.145 --> 01:09:29.439
Hear that?

01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:32.902
Well, now, that sounds
like a healthy dog to me.

01:09:33.002 --> 01:09:36.051
Take a look at him, Mama.
See for yourself.

01:09:42.553 --> 01:09:44.997
He sure looks fine, all right.

01:09:45.098 --> 01:09:47.834
Two whole weeks,
and nary a sign of a thing.

01:09:47.934 --> 01:09:49.435
Think we could let him out?

01:09:55.108 --> 01:09:57.782
No, son, not yet.

01:09:58.152 --> 01:10:02.373
They say sometimes
it takes a month to tell.

01:10:16.546 --> 01:10:18.531
Now, I told you,
if everything's all right,

01:10:18.631 --> 01:10:20.867
we'll let Old Yeller out come Saturday.

01:10:20.967 --> 01:10:22.952
But, Mama, why not now?

01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:24.746
No, we've waited this long.

01:10:24.846 --> 01:10:27.373
I guess we can stand it
another couple of days.

01:10:27.473 --> 01:10:29.475
Aw, Mama.

01:10:31.769 --> 01:10:33.988
Here we are, boy. More grub.

01:10:39.043 --> 01:10:40.561
Yeller?

01:10:54.834 --> 01:10:56.527
What's the matter, boy?

01:10:56.627 --> 01:10:59.005
Come on. It's time to eat.

01:11:29.494 --> 01:11:31.917
- How is he tonight?
- All right, I reckon.

01:11:32.705 --> 01:11:36.275
- Are you sure?
- I said he was all right, didn't I?

01:11:36.375 --> 01:11:40.363
I guess you wouldn't like it, either,
if you had to stay shut up in a corn crib!

01:11:40.463 --> 01:11:43.908
You ain't gonna keep my dog
locked up in that crib no more!

01:11:44.008 --> 01:11:47.638
You stay away from that dog.
You understand?

01:11:51.474 --> 01:11:53.192
It's time for you to go to bed, Arliss.

01:11:53.559 --> 01:11:56.045
- Aw, Mama.
- Do as I say.

01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:57.772
Yes'm.

01:12:23.756 --> 01:12:26.743
Don't you worry, boy.
I'll get you outta here.

01:12:49.699 --> 01:12:52.122
- Where's Arliss?
- I don't know.

01:12:57.498 --> 01:12:59.421
Arliss!

01:13:00.793 --> 01:13:02.215
Arliss!

01:13:05.631 --> 01:13:07.850
Arliss! Don't open that door!

01:13:08.843 --> 01:13:11.471
Arliss! Keep away from that door!

01:13:11.846 --> 01:13:13.848
Arliss!

01:14:06.609 --> 01:14:07.861
No, Mama.

01:14:08.527 --> 01:14:11.597
There's no hope for him now, Travis.

01:14:11.697 --> 01:14:15.668
He's sufferin'.
You know we've got to do it.

01:14:16.285 --> 01:14:18.788
I know, Mama.

01:14:19.288 --> 01:14:21.837
But he was my dog.

01:14:22.541 --> 01:14:24.384
I'll do it.

01:15:41.328 --> 01:15:42.580
Hello, the house!

01:15:42.913 --> 01:15:45.666
Papa! Ya done came home!

01:15:55.384 --> 01:15:59.184
Hiya, boy.
Ain't them injuns scalped you yet?

01:16:01.974 --> 01:16:05.753
- Papa, what'd you bring me?
- I brought you somethin', all right.

01:16:05.853 --> 01:16:08.527
Just hold your potatoes
while I go kiss your Mama.

01:16:09.356 --> 01:16:12.360
Jim! Oh, Jim!

01:16:17.948 --> 01:16:20.201
What'd you bring me home, Papa?
Where is it?

01:16:26.965 --> 01:16:30.277
Hear this, Katie? Money. Cash money.

01:16:30.377 --> 01:16:33.005
First we've had since the war.

01:16:34.173 --> 01:16:35.470
That ain't all.

01:16:35.925 --> 01:16:38.411
- What?
- I got that dress.

01:16:38.511 --> 01:16:40.413
- Prettiest thing you ever seen.
- Oh!

01:16:40.513 --> 01:16:42.331
And a fancy pair of shoes to go with it.

01:16:42.431 --> 01:16:45.584
- Gee-whiz!
- Put it on, son.

01:16:47.895 --> 01:16:50.256
There you are.

01:16:50.356 --> 01:16:52.049
All right, Chief. Let's hit the warpath.

01:16:54.149 --> 01:16:56.428
Come on, boy!

01:17:09.667 --> 01:17:11.510
Oh, Jim!

01:17:13.379 --> 01:17:15.381
It's lovely.

01:17:15.506 --> 01:17:17.053
I been achin' to see it on you.

01:17:24.431 --> 01:17:25.791
Where's Travis?

01:17:25.891 --> 01:17:29.545
I wanna get a look at his face
when he sees the horse I brung him.

01:17:29.645 --> 01:17:32.114
Him and Lisbeth Searcy
are over at North Hill...

01:17:33.232 --> 01:17:35.405
Burying Old Yeller.

01:17:36.235 --> 01:17:37.737
Old Yeller?

01:17:38.737 --> 01:17:40.739
Come in the house
and I'll tell you about it.

01:18:00.759 --> 01:18:02.181
Travis?

01:18:04.096 --> 01:18:08.084
If you could just come
to like the pup...

01:18:08.184 --> 01:18:11.420
He... He's part Old Yeller.

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:13.693
He may be part Old Yeller,

01:18:14.565 --> 01:18:16.238
but he ain't Old Yeller.

01:18:49.308 --> 01:18:52.152
Your mama told me about the dog.

01:18:55.314 --> 01:18:57.066
Come sit down, son.

01:19:07.076 --> 01:19:09.728
That was rough, son.

01:19:09.828 --> 01:19:13.440
As rough a thing as
I ever heard tell of.

01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:17.570
But I'm mighty proud
of how my boy stood up to it.

01:19:17.670 --> 01:19:20.014
Couldn't ask no more of a grown man.

01:19:22.132 --> 01:19:25.807
Thing to do now is... Try and forget it.

01:19:26.011 --> 01:19:28.038
Go on bein' a man.

01:19:28.138 --> 01:19:31.859
How, Pa? How you gonna
forget somethin' like that?

01:19:33.102 --> 01:19:35.355
I guess I don't quite mean that.

01:19:36.146 --> 01:19:39.300
Reckon it's not a thing you can forget.

01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:42.324
Maybe not even a thing you wanna forget.

01:19:47.157 --> 01:19:48.955
What I'm tryin' to say is...

01:19:50.452 --> 01:19:53.706
- Life's like that sometimes.
- Like what?

01:19:55.541 --> 01:19:57.134
Well.

01:19:58.085 --> 01:20:02.781
Now and then, for no good
reason a man can figure out,

01:20:02.881 --> 01:20:06.660
life will just haul off
and knock him flat.

01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:11.061
Slam him again' the ground so hard
it seems like all his insides is busted.

01:20:13.392 --> 01:20:15.502
But it's not all like that.

01:20:15.602 --> 01:20:17.570
A lot of it's mighty fine.

01:20:18.022 --> 01:20:22.509
And you can't afford to waste
the good part frettin' about the bad.

01:20:22.609 --> 01:20:24.987
That makes it all bad.

01:20:26.155 --> 01:20:28.390
You understand
what I'm trying to get at?

01:20:28.490 --> 01:20:30.163
Yes, sir.

01:20:30.868 --> 01:20:32.836
It's just that...

01:20:32.995 --> 01:20:36.124
Yeah, sure, I know.

01:20:37.416 --> 01:20:41.046
Sayin' it's one thing
and feelin' it's another.

01:20:41.754 --> 01:20:45.532
But I'll tell you a trick
that's sometimes a big help.

01:20:45.632 --> 01:20:47.618
You start lookin' around
for somethin' good

01:20:47.718 --> 01:20:49.436
to take the place of the bad.

01:20:50.262 --> 01:20:52.435
As a general rule, you can find it.

01:21:00.689 --> 01:21:03.442
- Brought you that horse I promised.
- Yes, sir.

01:21:03.817 --> 01:21:07.846
I reckon you ain't in no shape
to take pleasure in him yet.

01:21:07.946 --> 01:21:09.598
No, sir.

01:21:09.698 --> 01:21:11.767
We'll just keep him a while.

01:21:11.867 --> 01:21:14.311
Maybe you'll come to
feel different later on.

01:21:14.411 --> 01:21:16.397
Your mama was fixin' supper
when I left the house.

01:21:16.497 --> 01:21:20.252
Might hurt her feelings
if we're not there on time to eat it.

01:21:34.348 --> 01:21:36.476
Leave that alone! You get outta here!

01:21:36.683 --> 01:21:38.560
Put it down! Put it down!

01:21:39.561 --> 01:21:41.814
Why, you thievin', little wretch!

01:21:48.153 --> 01:21:50.889
Who's that beatin' my dog?

01:21:50.989 --> 01:21:53.892
You can't beat my dog!

01:21:54.292 --> 01:21:56.103
You can't beat my dog!

01:21:56.203 --> 01:21:58.922
Hold it, Chief. I think you're
fixin' to raise the wrong hair.

01:21:59.081 --> 01:22:01.066
Mama was tryin' to kill my dog.

01:22:01.166 --> 01:22:03.402
- I never even touched him.
- Of course, she didn't.

01:22:03.502 --> 01:22:06.905
Ooh, whee! Supper ready?

01:22:07.005 --> 01:22:09.133
- Ready and waitin'.
- Good.

01:22:24.356 --> 01:22:26.008
Looks like it's about time

01:22:26.108 --> 01:22:28.236
I started learnin'
this old pup to earn his keep.

01:22:29.528 --> 01:22:32.281
Don't look like to me he's hardly
big enough to learn nothin' yet.

01:22:32.531 --> 01:22:34.183
He's big enough to learn

01:22:34.283 --> 01:22:36.627
if he's big enough
to act like Old Yeller.

01:22:50.632 --> 01:22:52.509
<i>Young Yeller is a puppy</i>

01:22:53.677 --> 01:22:55.287
<i>A little ol' lop-eared puppy</i>

01:22:55.387 --> 01:22:59.142
<i>It's plain to see he's got a family tree</i>

01:22:59.475 --> 01:23:01.543
<i>The image of his pappy</i>

01:23:01.643 --> 01:23:03.737
<i>He's frisky and he's happy</i>

01:23:03.854 --> 01:23:08.342
<i>- And that's how a good pup should be
- Frisky and happy</i>

01:23:08.442 --> 01:23:10.490
<i>Here, Yeller</i>

01:23:10.694 --> 01:23:12.721
<i>Come back, Yeller</i>

01:23:12.821 --> 01:23:15.307
<i>Best doggone dog in the West</i>

01:23:15.407 --> 01:23:17.059
<i>In the West</i>

01:23:17.159 --> 01:23:19.269
<i>Here, Yeller</i>

01:23:19.369 --> 01:23:21.371
<i>Come back, Yeller</i>

01:23:21.497 --> 01:23:25.818
<i>Best doggone dog in the West</i>

01:23:25.918 --> 01:23:29.092
<i>Best doggone dog</i>

01:23:29.171 --> 01:23:33.392
<i>In the West</i>
