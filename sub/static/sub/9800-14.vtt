00:15.379 --> 00:16.692
Sunday morning.

00:16.898 --> 00:18.000
Sunday morning?

00:18.813 --> 00:20.786
It is still saturday night, baby.

00:20.911 --> 00:22.305
The sky spirits told me.

00:23.095 --> 00:24.389
Sky spirits?

00:25.842 --> 00:28.507
They send me signs
because I am the King.

00:28.984 --> 00:29.984
See that cloud?

00:30.109 --> 00:32.747
It says to me:
"party with the pansies".

00:33.169 --> 00:34.594
"Chimpanzees."

00:34.904 --> 00:37.720
And we were enjoying
a quiet morning, if you don't mind.

00:38.299 --> 00:39.303
I do mind.

00:39.528 --> 00:41.223
That cloud said: "party time",

00:41.533 --> 00:42.825
so it's time to party.

00:43.886 --> 00:46.095
Crank up
that crazy conga rhythm, Mort!

00:50.834 --> 00:52.872
Please, not conga.

00:52.997 --> 00:54.837
<i>I am the conga King,</i>

00:55.108 --> 00:56.439
<i>doing the conga thing.</i>

00:56.607 --> 00:59.742
<i>Tail up and tail down,
hold my bottom and sing.</i>

01:00.385 --> 01:02.044
<i>Let's all go, conganga.</i>

01:02.212 --> 01:03.746
<i>More fun in, conganga.</i>

01:04.000 --> 01:05.748
<i>You can't stop, conganga.</i>

01:05.916 --> 01:07.441
<i>Jump in line and sing.</i>

01:07.566 --> 01:09.045
<i>Let's all go, conganga.</i>

01:09.170 --> 01:10.958
<i>More fun in, conganga.</i>

01:11.083 --> 01:12.537
<i>You can't stop, conganga.</i>

01:12.662 --> 01:14.492
<i>- Jump in line and sing.
- Conganga!</i>

01:14.617 --> 01:16.062
<i>Please don't be tardy</i>

01:16.187 --> 01:18.861
<i>'cause we're having a dance party.</i>
<i>That noise, little boys is called...</i>

01:21.528 --> 01:22.983
<i>conganga!</i>

01:30.076 --> 01:31.173
Conganga!

01:32.619 --> 01:34.677
Yay for King Julien!

01:35.995 --> 01:37.845
Come on, you funky monkeys.

01:38.031 --> 01:39.315
Jump in line.

01:39.996 --> 01:42.817
He must be stopped
before he congas again.

01:43.910 --> 01:45.154
An eclipse?

01:45.760 --> 01:48.282
What's that have to do
with King dancy-pants?

01:48.936 --> 01:50.885
The sky spirits, you say?

01:51.209 --> 01:54.305
Phil, that is positively diabolical.

01:54.723 --> 01:55.610
Lovely.

02:00.331 --> 02:03.139
I am swimming in kingly sweatiness.

02:03.633 --> 02:05.225
Turn up the fan, Maurice.

02:07.915 --> 02:09.420
That is funky...

02:09.743 --> 02:11.464
and not in a musical way.

02:11.895 --> 02:14.644
King Julien,
you are truly inspiring.

02:15.294 --> 02:17.389
I know. It is from the dancing.

02:18.198 --> 02:19.609
About the dancing.

02:19.943 --> 02:22.391
We were just conversing
with the sky spirits...

02:22.646 --> 02:23.446
Word up.

02:23.571 --> 02:25.480
The sky spirits love me.

02:25.997 --> 02:27.562
Peace out, sky spirits.

02:28.923 --> 02:29.923
Wait, wait.

02:30.495 --> 02:31.567
"Conversing"?

02:32.511 --> 02:34.870
Indeed. Phil translates, actually.

02:35.590 --> 02:37.131
Begin countdown.

02:37.882 --> 02:41.010
Anyway, the sky spirits
want to tell you something

02:41.178 --> 02:42.678
right about...

02:43.443 --> 02:44.216
now.

02:54.128 --> 02:55.958
Why is the blue sky not sky bluish?

02:56.854 --> 03:01.342
Somebody made the sky spirits
very, very angry.

03:02.637 --> 03:03.925
I wonder who that.

03:06.059 --> 03:09.105
- Something's wrong with the sun.
- He finally did it.

03:09.521 --> 03:12.222
- Who did what?
- My mad dolphin Nemesis,

03:12.347 --> 03:13.584
Dr. Blowhole.

03:14.228 --> 03:15.375
He blew out the sun.

03:15.500 --> 03:17.322
Actually, according
to my calculations,

03:17.447 --> 03:20.416
it is the rare cosmic event
known as a solar eclipse.

03:21.218 --> 03:23.920
You sure it's not the crazed handiwork
of my marine mammal foe?

03:24.229 --> 03:26.756
It's totally natural.
The moon is between the earth

03:26.924 --> 03:28.024
and the sun.

03:29.213 --> 03:30.721
It's a total eclipse.

03:32.406 --> 03:34.974
Are you as totally stoked
about this as I am?

03:39.508 --> 03:41.337
It should only last a few minutes.

03:41.840 --> 03:44.265
Forever? No more sun forever?

03:46.998 --> 03:50.279
Afraid so. The sky spirits
are terrifically peeved at you.

03:50.512 --> 03:52.718
Apparently,
and this is them talking, not me,

03:52.843 --> 03:54.216
they feel that you're rude,

03:54.533 --> 03:55.686
bossy, selfish.

03:55.811 --> 03:59.255
And they absolutely loathe
the all-night dance parties.

03:59.706 --> 04:01.357
Maurice, say something to them.

04:01.795 --> 04:04.327
Sorry. I don't speak sky spirit.

04:06.230 --> 04:08.965
What can I do
to make them love me again,

04:10.088 --> 04:12.049
to bring back the sun?

04:15.061 --> 04:16.168
Ridiculous.

04:16.293 --> 04:18.301
The King would never stoop so low.

04:18.939 --> 04:21.476
How low are we talking? Like this?

04:21.853 --> 04:23.496
Well, change your kingly ways.

04:23.621 --> 04:26.315
Be less bossy, less rude.
And less conganga.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.476
Hear me, sky spirits.

04:30.898 --> 04:33.822
I get the message!
I can change!

04:34.514 --> 04:35.558
You know, a little.

04:37.948 --> 04:39.862
Make it a lot,
and you've got a deal.

04:40.276 --> 04:41.624
Okay, you win.

04:41.807 --> 04:43.477
I'll change bigly.

04:47.713 --> 04:49.785
Thanking you, sky spirits.

04:50.410 --> 04:52.445
I will not let you down.

04:54.230 --> 04:56.150
Good luck with the nice new you.

04:56.730 --> 04:57.480
Nice.

04:57.648 --> 04:59.774
I'm going to need
a little help with that.

05:06.227 --> 05:08.044
You are the nicest guy here.

05:08.169 --> 05:09.537
Make me be nice.

05:09.662 --> 05:10.893
I command you!

05:11.231 --> 05:12.361
That wasn't very nice.

05:12.744 --> 05:14.730
Then you are failing already.

05:16.342 --> 05:18.868
I mean you are
the nicest guy here, right?

05:19.574 --> 05:21.504
That's very kind of you to say.

05:23.124 --> 05:25.758
See? That's what I'm talking about,
right there.

05:25.883 --> 05:27.777
The nice, I need some of that.

05:28.919 --> 05:30.246
Kowalski, analysis.

05:31.815 --> 05:33.316
I'm picking up good vibrations.

05:33.625 --> 05:36.753
Please! If you don't help me,
every day will be an all-night party

05:36.878 --> 05:38.120
without the party part.

05:38.458 --> 05:41.290
- The sky spirits said so.
- Sky spirits?

05:42.424 --> 05:44.141
Did you see the darkness?

05:44.266 --> 05:45.328
The eclipse.

05:46.622 --> 05:47.804
The darkness.

05:48.136 --> 05:49.236
It was my fault,

05:49.361 --> 05:52.222
and now I'm doomded to be nice,

05:52.567 --> 05:54.770
and I don't know how to do that.

05:56.443 --> 05:59.298
Well, if you want others
to think of you as nice,

05:59.423 --> 06:01.444
you could start
by being nice to others.

06:01.981 --> 06:02.912
Genius.

07:00.279 --> 07:03.482
Just waiting for you to roll over
so I can fluff up your pillow.

07:03.607 --> 07:04.854
Not necessary.

07:04.979 --> 07:07.109
It's okay.
I am prepared to stay all night.

07:07.277 --> 07:09.078
I like a hard pillow.

07:10.040 --> 07:11.747
I could be your pillow.

07:11.915 --> 07:14.230
My bottom is very plush and fluffy,
you know.

07:17.431 --> 07:18.431
That's it.

07:19.490 --> 07:20.983
No more Mr. Nice guy.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.092
- For you or Julien?
- Whatever works.

07:25.181 --> 07:26.720
You can stop now, please.

07:26.845 --> 07:28.431
Just quit being nice already.

07:29.438 --> 07:30.332
I see.

07:30.520 --> 07:33.125
This is a test
to see if I can stay nice

07:33.250 --> 07:35.964
even when you get
all mean and screamy.

07:36.377 --> 07:37.627
Clever penguin.

07:39.745 --> 07:42.545
Now the test is to be nice
to someone else,

07:42.834 --> 07:45.556
someone you've never been nice
to ever before.

07:49.286 --> 07:50.521
This is the life.

07:50.646 --> 07:53.522
Ever since the chimps told him
about the sky spirits hatin' on him

07:53.690 --> 07:55.258
and shutting out the lights...

07:55.426 --> 07:56.392
Villain Mason?

07:56.747 --> 07:59.362
Looks like the chimps
played ringtail for a chump.

07:59.530 --> 08:02.231
I am so happy.

08:03.834 --> 08:06.168
It's Shiatsu... I think.

08:06.479 --> 08:09.872
Listen up. The truth is,
the darkness had nothing to do

08:10.040 --> 08:12.555
with any so-called sky spirits
or you.

08:12.680 --> 08:15.411
You were conned, tricked,
played for a patsy.

08:15.823 --> 08:18.030
That kind of talk
can get you in big trouble

08:18.155 --> 08:19.982
with the sky spirits, mister.

08:20.278 --> 08:22.946
Do you want to be the one
massaging Mort?

08:23.071 --> 08:24.120
I don't think so.

08:30.435 --> 08:31.968
I have what you're looking for.

08:32.092 --> 08:34.764
Outstanding.
So when's the next big eclipse?

08:35.049 --> 08:36.049
From today?

08:36.174 --> 08:38.034
27 years, in Brazil.

08:38.924 --> 08:41.003
I've always wanted
to go to carnaval.

08:41.995 --> 08:42.768
Think.

08:43.249 --> 08:45.899
We need another sign
from the sky spirits.

08:49.278 --> 08:50.538
Dealer takes two.

08:51.749 --> 08:53.683
A losing hand. That's the signal.

08:56.263 --> 08:57.720
Stone generator is a go.

08:58.202 --> 08:59.956
Four aces. I win!

09:00.124 --> 09:01.290
In your face.

09:03.749 --> 09:06.963
I mean, of course, this is your hand.
I was only holding it.

09:08.264 --> 09:10.542
Sounds like the sky spirits

09:10.667 --> 09:13.231
are trying to send you a message.

09:14.508 --> 09:17.006
But I am being extra crazy nice.

09:17.408 --> 09:19.779
New York's sky spirits
are fickle pickles.

09:20.172 --> 09:22.211
If they send us a sky spark...

09:23.390 --> 09:24.480
A sky spark?

09:24.835 --> 09:27.149
- That's their way of saying...
- That I have to be

09:27.317 --> 09:28.881
even nicer?

09:30.332 --> 09:33.856
If you see a flash in the sky,
that means you can stop being nice.

09:34.283 --> 09:38.127
- No more pillow fluffing?
- Bingo. Like this never happened.

09:38.662 --> 09:39.862
Go, go, go!

09:47.760 --> 09:49.272
This is all so complicated.

09:53.105 --> 09:54.173
Did you see it?

09:54.596 --> 09:55.596
See what?

09:55.721 --> 09:57.417
Dear. I think he missed it.

09:57.542 --> 10:00.588
But we did create a... cloudburst.

10:02.276 --> 10:04.105
The sky spirits are crying.

10:05.330 --> 10:07.237
It was a sign from above.

10:07.675 --> 10:10.760
The sky spirits want you to go back

10:10.928 --> 10:13.270
to your old royal pain self.

10:14.076 --> 10:15.619
I can conganga again?

10:15.890 --> 10:18.835
I don't know what that means,
but, sure.

10:18.960 --> 10:19.835
Go for it.

10:23.979 --> 10:26.509
Colorful. Is that the sign
you were speaking?

10:27.957 --> 10:28.945
That's the one.

10:29.938 --> 10:32.367
Powerful New York sky spirits,

10:32.492 --> 10:34.951
I read you loud and clear.

10:36.844 --> 10:40.395
Because you helped me get back
the sky spirit love,

10:40.630 --> 10:43.485
I will now spread
some of that love here.

10:43.704 --> 10:46.139
Now and for a long time to come.

10:46.663 --> 10:47.663
Please, no.

10:49.541 --> 10:50.800
Please, yes!

10:51.613 --> 10:53.369
Party time, pansies!

10:57.304 --> 10:59.253
Mission accomplished, men.
