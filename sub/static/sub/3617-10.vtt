Darryl, have you heard
from Paige?

13:11.209 --> 13:13.899
Because she was supposed
to come straight home
from the hospital--

13:13.999 --> 13:16.899
Paige is in jail.
We tried to call you, but--

13:16.999 --> 13:18.526
What?
What for, what for?

13:18.626 --> 13:21.109
Reckless endangerment
and felony hit and run.

13:21.209 --> 13:22.667
What?

13:25.999 --> 13:28.899
- Oops.
- You have got to be kidding me.

13:28.999 --> 13:31.150
Paige, Darryl
said you were in jail.

13:31.250 --> 13:32.484
Oh, I am.

13:32.584 --> 13:33.899
I mean, I was.
I will be,

13:33.999 --> 13:36.442
just as soon as I figure out
what demon is doing this to me.

13:36.542 --> 13:38.651
You just disappeared from jail?

13:38.751 --> 13:42.025
No, I put pillows
in the bed first.

13:42.125 --> 13:43.899
It always worked
at my parents' house.

13:43.999 --> 13:45.192
- Paige!
- PAIGE: What?

13:45.292 --> 13:47.150
You weren't gonna help me,
so I had to help myself.

13:47.250 --> 13:50.083
Whether you believe it or not,
there is a demon behind this.

13:53.459 --> 13:56.983
At 2:00, they're gonna come get
you for your bail hearing.

13:57.083 --> 14:02.692
If you're not there,
that's my ass.
Everybody knows we're friends.

14:02.792 --> 14:05.484
They're gonna just think
I just let you go.

14:05.584 --> 14:08.751
I will be there at 2:00.

14:18.167 --> 14:19.526
PIPER:
See you.

14:19.626 --> 14:20.899
Okay, he hates me.

14:20.999 --> 14:23.918
Yeah, he does, but for what
it's worth, I'm with you.

14:24.667 --> 14:26.234
Leo's doing the Elder thing.

14:26.334 --> 14:28.609
Oh, let me guess,
you didn't pass inspection.

14:28.709 --> 14:31.067
- Nope.
- Let's just cut to the chase,
shall we?

14:31.167 --> 14:32.442
Our problems are legal, right?

14:32.542 --> 14:34.526
Who's the only demonic lawyer
that we know?

14:34.626 --> 14:37.609
Cole. And he has gone off
the deep end lately,

14:37.709 --> 14:40.859
but how is ruining our lives
gonna help him get Phoebe back?

14:40.959 --> 14:45.442
I don't know. But until we
figure it out, we should
keep her out of it.

14:45.542 --> 14:47.609
You slimy son of a bitch.

14:47.709 --> 14:51.025
- Phoebe, is that you?
- What are you, evil and blind?

14:51.125 --> 14:54.899
Yeah, it's me. Look,
why don't you just admit
that you're behind this.

14:54.999 --> 14:57.609
Admit it so I can use
magic to fight you.

14:57.709 --> 15:01.567
I don't know-- I don't know
what you're talking about.

15:01.667 --> 15:04.900
Look, Cole, my career
is the most important thing
to me.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.275
Okay, so is that your plan?
To take it away from me

15:07.375 --> 15:09.667
so that I come running
to you for comfort?

15:11.083 --> 15:13.899
Phoebe, I love you.
And I don't know
what's going on,

15:13.999 --> 15:15.899
but maybe I could help.

15:15.999 --> 15:19.484
Would you like me to
kill someone for you, or...?

15:19.584 --> 15:21.375
Your-- Your boss, perhaps?

15:24.167 --> 15:27.859
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

15:27.959 --> 15:29.401
I might not be able
to use magic--

15:29.501 --> 15:31.317
You're sexy when you're mad,
you know.

15:31.417 --> 15:33.401
I can't wait until
I get to kiss you again.

15:33.501 --> 15:38.899
Cole, I will never be with you
again. I hate you. I hate you.
Do you get that?

15:38.999 --> 15:41.983
Hate is good.
It's passionate, intense.

15:42.083 --> 15:44.999
It's-- It's a breath away
from love.

15:53.209 --> 15:55.125
Ah, she's great.

16:06.083 --> 16:08.292
What do you want?

16:10.083 --> 16:12.542
Just to give you what you want.

16:27.459 --> 16:28.899
So, what are we gonna do?

16:28.999 --> 16:31.501
We're gonna tell him we're onto
him and it's not gonna work.

16:44.999 --> 16:47.150
PAIGE: I can't believe
I saw what I just saw.

16:47.250 --> 16:48.859
Probably because I saw it too.

16:48.959 --> 16:51.526
But how? Why is she kissing him?

16:51.626 --> 16:53.359
I don't know,
but I say we go back in there

16:53.459 --> 16:55.150
- and we pull her out
by her hair.
- No.

16:55.250 --> 16:59.234
No. We can't make a scene.
Okay, we need a plan.

16:59.334 --> 17:04.692
Okay, here it is.
We go home, we vomit...

17:04.791 --> 17:06.776
- And?
- That's all I got so far.

17:06.876 --> 17:08.541
Okay.

17:12.125 --> 17:15.067
Oh, come on, baby,
it was just getting good.

17:15.166 --> 17:16.898
Not good enough.

17:16.999 --> 17:19.898
You'll never be as good
as the real Phoebe and
you should stop trying.

17:19.999 --> 17:22.983
You're right.
I'll never be as good.

17:23.083 --> 17:25.898
I'll be better.
I know tricks

17:25.999 --> 17:27.983
the real Phoebe's
never even heard of before.

17:28.083 --> 17:31.042
I've been patient with you
up until now.

17:32.209 --> 17:34.709
This is the last time
I'm gonna say this.

17:35.999 --> 17:37.542
Leave and don't come back.

17:39.918 --> 17:42.334
You don't know
what you're missing.

17:52.459 --> 17:54.818
Hey! What did I tell you?

17:54.918 --> 17:58.899
Cole has some serious work
to do and I will not have you
distracting him.

17:58.999 --> 18:00.899
Cole? What the hell--?
Who are you?

18:00.999 --> 18:03.025
Get it through your thick head.
The leader of the underworld

18:03.125 --> 18:04.983
will never have a whore
as his queen.

18:05.083 --> 18:07.250
Did you just call me a whore?

18:08.918 --> 18:09.999
DEX:
Kaia?

18:12.999 --> 18:15.359
There's not-- There's no--
Are you sure?

18:15.459 --> 18:18.651
Leo, we saw Phoebe and Cole,
tongues locked,

18:18.751 --> 18:21.899
hands groping all over
each other. Ugh.

18:21.999 --> 18:23.192
Okay. Didn't need the visual.

18:23.292 --> 18:25.734
Well, maybe he has her under
some kind of mind control.

18:25.834 --> 18:27.899
I mean, he can do that.
That's possible, right?

18:27.999 --> 18:30.150
Right. I think right now
he could do pretty much
anything.

18:30.250 --> 18:31.818
Why? What do you mean?

18:31.918 --> 18:34.526
The Elders have sensed
a major surge in demonic
activity.

18:34.626 --> 18:37.067
And they think that evil
is organizing under
a new leader.

18:37.167 --> 18:40.899
That's just great, because
the last time Cole was
the leader of the underworld,

18:40.999 --> 18:42.359
he took Phoebe as his queen

18:42.459 --> 18:44.899
and we were completely
blindsided by it that time too.

18:44.999 --> 18:48.818
Oh, my God, that's why
she didn't want me to
try to vanquish him.

18:48.918 --> 18:50.899
She was talking this morning
about being tempted.

18:50.999 --> 18:53.150
She was trying to warn us
and we didn't even see it.

18:53.250 --> 18:55.192
Okay, this just cannot
be happening, people.

18:55.292 --> 18:57.484
I mean, Phoebe would not
do this to us.

18:57.584 --> 19:00.150
I mean, it cannot, cannot,
cannot be happening.

19:00.250 --> 19:03.359
Okay, let's just calm down,
okay? The last time
Phoebe was evil,

19:03.459 --> 19:06.192
she was under the influence
of her demonic pregnancy.

19:06.292 --> 19:08.609
So, what, you're saying
you think she's pregnant again?

19:08.709 --> 19:10.899
No, I just think that maybe
we're underestimating her.

19:10.999 --> 19:12.942
Maybe there's something
that we're missing.

19:13.042 --> 19:14.983
We saw what we saw.

19:15.083 --> 19:18.359
Maybe she's under a spell.
Or maybe there was
some information

19:18.459 --> 19:21.442
that she wanted
and she was using sex as a tool?

19:21.542 --> 19:24.692
Okay, I like the sound of that.
Slutty and manipulative,

19:24.792 --> 19:26.025
that's better than evil any day.

19:26.125 --> 19:27.859
So let's not panic.
Let's talk to Phoebe

19:27.959 --> 19:30.484
and give her a chance
to explain what's going on.

19:30.584 --> 19:31.899
By the way, Darryl called.

19:31.999 --> 19:33.999
[CLOCK BELL SOUNDS]

19:36.542 --> 19:37.899
Oh.

19:37.999 --> 19:40.275
DARRYL: If she's not ready,
the judge won't wait.

19:40.375 --> 19:41.999
Paige?

19:44.042 --> 19:46.959
Oh, hey, guys,
what took you so long?

19:54.334 --> 19:55.999
Coming, Darryl?

19:59.667 --> 20:01.359
PHOEBE:
Ow! Hey!

20:01.459 --> 20:03.942
I wouldn't have to hurt you,
if you stopped trying
to get away.

20:04.042 --> 20:05.250
[GRUNTING]

20:06.584 --> 20:08.150
What happened?

20:08.250 --> 20:10.567
I-- I mistook her
for the other one.

20:10.667 --> 20:12.899
And I said too much.

20:12.999 --> 20:15.292
I thought I'd bring her here
until the end of the operation.

20:16.584 --> 20:18.417
Well, good thinking.

20:22.999 --> 20:25.359
Well, as much fun
as this has been...

20:25.459 --> 20:29.292
I'm sorry, Phoebe, but Dex is
right. I can't let you leave.

20:32.667 --> 20:34.918
- Leo!
- Save your voice.

20:35.959 --> 20:38.899
This place is
magically protected.

20:38.999 --> 20:43.692
I can't have you people
sensing what I'm doing in here.

20:43.792 --> 20:47.334
Now all the windows
and doors are blocked.

20:49.459 --> 20:51.734
And please, sweetie,

20:51.834 --> 20:53.234
just trust me on this one.

20:53.334 --> 20:55.899
I don't want you getting hurt
trying to escape.

20:55.999 --> 20:57.526
All right,
don't call me sweetie.

20:57.626 --> 21:01.501
You can't hold a person prisoner
and then call them sweetie.

21:02.999 --> 21:04.818
- You know...
- Ugh.

21:04.918 --> 21:06.609
...I didn't intend this.

21:06.709 --> 21:08.899
I just can't have you
running off to your sisters

21:08.999 --> 21:12.067
and protecting the Nexus, okay?

21:12.167 --> 21:14.899
It is way too important to us.

21:14.999 --> 21:16.999
Wait, the Nexus?

21:18.792 --> 21:21.776
- Dex didn't tell you
about that?
- No. No, he didn't.

21:21.876 --> 21:24.359
He just told me you were trying
to reorganize the underworld.

21:24.459 --> 21:27.899
Oops. Don't be mad.
I only want the Nexus

21:27.999 --> 21:31.275
so that you can come back to
evil and we can be together.

21:31.375 --> 21:32.899
- Cole--
- I'm so sorry

21:32.999 --> 21:34.484
I had to involve your work.

21:34.584 --> 21:37.859
I just needed you distracted
while I ruined Piper's club

21:37.959 --> 21:40.275
and put Paige in jail.

21:40.375 --> 21:42.899
Paige is in jail?

21:42.999 --> 21:44.526
Listen, I'd love
to stay and chat,

21:44.626 --> 21:46.859
but all things considered,
I need to speed up my plan.

21:46.959 --> 21:49.692
Look, Cole, my sisters
are gonna realize
that I'm missing,

21:49.792 --> 21:50.983
and Leo is gonna try
to sense me.

21:51.083 --> 21:53.334
And when he can't,
they're gonna
come straight to you.

21:55.417 --> 21:59.876
Um... Look, thanks for
the concern, but I think
I've got my bases covered.

22:01.876 --> 22:03.918
I knew you'd want me again.

22:04.501 --> 22:05.899
Ignore her.

22:05.999 --> 22:08.067
Oh, my God.

22:08.167 --> 22:10.776
Oh, no. Not God. Kaia.

22:10.876 --> 22:12.899
Just listen to her voice.

22:12.999 --> 22:15.818
You're sick, you know that?
You need help.

22:15.918 --> 22:19.442
I mean, are you sleeping
with me? I mean her?

22:19.542 --> 22:22.042
You're sick, you know that?
You need help.

22:22.918 --> 22:24.109
Good.

22:24.209 --> 22:25.609
Oh, my God.

22:25.709 --> 22:27.401
Oh, my God.

22:27.501 --> 22:28.609
COLE:
Excellent.

22:28.709 --> 22:30.501
Come on, Kaia.

22:31.999 --> 22:33.876
Ooh, I'm gonna need this.

22:36.083 --> 22:39.125
There's some leftover
Chinese food in the fridge.

22:46.501 --> 22:48.609
So if you don't want me,
then what do you want?

22:48.709 --> 22:51.859
I want you to go to Phoebe's
house and pretend to be her
for a while.

22:51.959 --> 22:54.899
Do your job well
and you'll be amply rewarded.

22:54.999 --> 22:59.609
For a while? Why not just get
rid of her and I can take her
place forever?

22:59.709 --> 23:03.609
Aside from the fact that I love
her, Phoebe's a Charmed One.

23:03.709 --> 23:06.692
She's protected by her powers.
You can't just kill her,

23:06.792 --> 23:09.942
so don't get any silly ideas
and stop playing with your hair.

23:10.042 --> 23:12.167
Phoebe's more sophisticated
than that.

23:13.584 --> 23:16.609
Now, go to the house
and lay low for a while.

23:16.709 --> 23:19.626
I just need a little time
to speed things up.

23:29.999 --> 23:32.542
Did you sustain your injuries
in an accident
with Paige Matthews?

23:33.542 --> 23:34.776
Um...

23:34.876 --> 23:37.899
Yeah. I guess that was her name.

23:37.999 --> 23:39.442
What are you, a lawyer?

23:39.542 --> 23:40.899
Yeah.

23:40.999 --> 23:41.999
That and other things.

23:42.999 --> 23:44.584
What?

23:53.709 --> 23:55.317
Sorry.

23:55.417 --> 23:56.999
Nothing personal.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.983
Oh. Uh...
Hi, Piper.

24:05.083 --> 24:07.526
- Don't you "Hi, Piper" me,
I saw you.
- I thought you said

24:07.626 --> 24:09.317
- you were gonna be calm.
- I am calm.

24:09.417 --> 24:11.359
- You saw me what?
- Don't act like you don't know

24:11.459 --> 24:12.899
what I'm talking about.

24:12.999 --> 24:14.899
No, trust me,
it's not an act.

24:14.999 --> 24:17.667
We saw you making out
with Cole.

24:19.834 --> 24:22.067
Oh. Ugh.

24:22.167 --> 24:24.192
Okay, well, that's
just not possible,

24:24.292 --> 24:28.526
you see, because
I'm pretty sure
that I hate Cole, right?

24:28.626 --> 24:31.776
Phoebe, I am pregnant,
I am emotional,
and I am freaking out.

24:31.876 --> 24:34.317
And if you are back together
with Cole,
then that is just fine,

24:34.417 --> 24:36.375
but do not deny
what I just saw.

24:36.999 --> 24:38.526
Okay.

24:38.626 --> 24:42.150
All right. Then, uh,
I'm back together with Cole.

24:42.250 --> 24:45.526
- What?
- What!? How can you say that?

24:45.626 --> 24:47.484
Well, I thought you said
it was fine.

24:47.584 --> 24:50.818
Well, I didn't mean it.
And for God sakes,
the man mummified you.

24:50.918 --> 24:52.818
Whoa, seriously?

24:52.918 --> 24:55.526
Okay, something's not right.
Her memory seems gone.

24:55.626 --> 24:57.899
Okay, that's a good sign.

24:57.999 --> 25:00.109
Now, Phoebe, try and focus.

25:00.209 --> 25:03.983
Does Cole have you under
some kind of spell?

25:04.083 --> 25:06.526

that's his plan.

Look, you guys underestimated me
once already today.

38:15.459 --> 38:16.918
Please don't do it again.

38:21.292 --> 38:23.609
She twirled her hair.

You're no lady, Kaia.
And the boss sent you away.

39:16.792 --> 39:20.776
Yeah, but he didn't mean it.
Come on, let me past.

My sweet Phoebe.

field, past the guards.

40:50.501 --> 40:52.317
But I love that you did.

40:52.417 --> 40:54.899
It's that fight that made me
fall in love with you in the
