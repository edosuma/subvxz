WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE,

00:07.640 --> 00:09.699

TO A MAN

00:11.010 --> 00:13.535
WHO DEDICATED HIS LIFE'S WORK

00:13.580 --> 00:15.275

IF THERE IS A PIATA.

00:22.520 --> 00:24.613
I DON'T THINK SO.
- OH.

00:24.650 --> 00:26.481
WELL, I WAS TOLD
THIS WAS A PARTY.

00:26.520 --> 00:29.353

LASSITER AND I HAVE TO TESTIFY

00:38.730 --> 00:40.630
- YOU WANT ME TO COME WITH YOU?
PLEASE SAY YES.

00:40.670 --> 00:42.069
- UH, HOLD UP THERE.

00:42.110 --> 00:45.500
LOOKS LIKE
I MIGHT BE NEEDING A WINGMAN.

00:48.680 --> 00:50.079
- OH, MY GOD.

00:50.110 --> 00:52.169
YOU DON'T CARE
ABOUT JIM DUBOIS.

00:52.220 --> 00:54.609
YOU DISGUST ME.
YOU MAKE ME SICK TO MY FACE.

00:54.650 --> 00:57.778
I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.
SHE'S STANDING RIGHT HERE.

00:57.820 --> 00:59.754
- IT'S TRUE. I AM.
- OH, THEY'RE BOTH FOR ME.

00:59.790 --> 01:03.089

ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.

01:07.800 --> 01:09.791

01:09.830 --> 01:12.765
EXCUSE ME,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!

01:12.800 --> 01:14.791
CAN I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION
FOR A MOMENT, PLEASE?

01:14.840 --> 01:16.637
[laughs]
DAMN IT, JIM.

01:16.670 --> 01:18.638
YOU HAD A LONG CAREER,
MY MAN,

01:18.670 --> 01:21.673
PERHAPS THE LONGEST
OF ALL TIME.

01:21.710 --> 01:23.507
YOU TOUCHED US ALL RIGHT HERE,

01:23.550 --> 01:25.575
A LITTLE BIT UP HERE...

01:25.610 --> 01:27.146
JUST A TEENY-WEENY BIT--

01:27.180 --> 01:28.340

01:30.620 --> 01:32.451

HE NEVER FIRED HIS WEAPON.

01:32.490 --> 01:35.379

IN YOUR OFF HOURS.

01:35.420 --> 01:38.423
AND NOW, JIM, YOU CAN RIDE OFF
INTO THE SUNSET,

01:38.460 --> 01:40.428
SPEND SOME QUALITY TIME
WITH YOUR MOM HERE.

01:40.460 --> 01:43.122

01:43.170 --> 01:45.297

01:47.440 --> 01:50.432
- HEY, BARTENDER,
HOW ABOUT A ROUND OF SHOTS...

01:50.470 --> 01:54.338

02:39.260 --> 02:40.613
WHAT?

02:40.660 --> 02:42.389
- MAN, I THINK WE SLEPT HERE.

02:42.430 --> 02:44.751
- WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT?

02:44.790 --> 02:47.497
- STRANGELY, I HAVE NO IDEA.

02:47.530 --> 02:49.521
WAIT.

02:50.770 --> 02:53.762
[indistinct chatter]

02:53.800 --> 02:57.759
NOTHING--
WEIRD, DISJOINTED.

02:57.810 --> 02:59.630
MY FINGER-TO-EYEBROW DEVICE
IS BROKEN.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.636
THAT'S NEVER HAPPENED
TO ME BEFORE.

03:01.680 --> 03:03.898
MY MEMORY IS COMPLETELY BLANK.
- SHAWN...

03:03.950 --> 03:06.942
WHY IS THERE A SHOWER CAP
ON YOUR HEAD?

03:10.550 --> 03:12.916
- I'M SURE THERE'S A VERY EASY
EXPLANATION FOR THIS.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.518
- IS THERE
AN EASY EXPLANATION

03:18.830 --> 03:20.388
- WHERE ARE MY NIKES?

03:20.430 --> 03:22.796
- AND WHY ARE YOU WEARING
A GOLD CHAIN, SHAWN?

03:22.830 --> 03:26.539
- HUH.
[man groaning]

03:30.940 --> 03:33.636
- OH, DEAR LORD,
PLEASE TELL ME THIS IS A DREAM.

03:33.680 --> 03:35.875
- CALM DOWN, PEACHES.

03:35.910 --> 03:38.708
COME BACK TO BED.

03:40.580 --> 03:42.286
- WHATEVER YOU THINK HAPPENED
LAST NIGHT DIDN'T HAPPEN,

03:42.320 --> 03:43.639
BECAUSE NOTHING HAPPENED.
YOU GOT IT?

03:43.690 --> 03:45.908
- THAT'S NICE, LASSIE.
WAY TO BELI'I'I'LE THE MAN.

03:45.950 --> 03:48.510
- YEAH, DETECTIVE,
I-I DO HAVE FEELINGS.

03:48.560 --> 03:51.950
- WHAT IS ALL OVER YOUR FACE?

03:51.990 --> 03:53.491
- EH, I CAN'T BE SURE.

03:53.530 --> 03:54.622
OH, GOD.

03:54.660 --> 03:56.560
Y-Y-YOU DIDN'T SEE
A SMALL COLOMBIAN

03:56.600 --> 03:57.919
WITH A HOOK FOR AN ARM,
DID YOU?

03:57.970 --> 03:59.369
- NO.
- NO?

03:59.400 --> 04:02.460
- WHY DO YOU HAVE A BLACK EYE?

04:05.470 --> 04:07.404
- OKAY, THERE'S NOTHING
TO FREAK OUT ABOUT.

04:07.440 --> 04:08.702
EVERYBODY RELAX.

04:08.740 --> 04:10.446
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.
IT'S JUST A SMALL SHINER.

04:10.480 --> 04:11.674
- LASSIE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.849
HIS LOVERS' SPAT WITH WOODY
IS REALLY NONE OF OUR BUSINESS.

04:13.880 --> 04:15.518
- I SHOULD (NU-L MY WIFE.

04:15.550 --> 04:17.541
- OH, WE DON'T KEEP SECRETS.
- NOBODY'S CALLING ANYBODY!

04:17.590 --> 04:19.683
- UH-OH.

04:19.720 --> 04:21.551
- MY BABY!

04:23.890 --> 04:24.982
SON--

04:25.030 --> 04:28.454
IT'S MISSING THREE BULLETS.

04:28.500 --> 04:32.368
I CAN TELL BY THE WEIGHT.
IT'S THREE LIGHT.

04:33.740 --> 04:34.832
- IT'S BEEN FIRED.

04:34.870 --> 04:37.737
- UH, SHOULDN'T SOMEONE
START FREAKING OUT RIGHT NOW?

04:37.770 --> 04:41.729
- WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT'S THIS?

04:41.780 --> 04:44.340
LOOKS LIKE I MADE
SOME SORT OF VIDEO LAST NIGHT.

04:44.380 --> 04:45.608
[men cheering on phone]

04:45.650 --> 04:47.470

RIGHT HERE?

04:47.520 --> 04:50.341
- YOU KNOW WHO HE IS.
- THIS GUY RIGHT HERE.

04:50.390 --> 04:51.880
I HAVE NO IDEA.
SHAWN?

04:51.920 --> 04:53.615
- I TOLD YOU, I'M BROKEN.

04:53.660 --> 04:55.548
I GOT NOTHING.
STUGOTS.

04:55.590 --> 04:56.682
[men shouting]

04:56.730 --> 04:58.755
- HOW IS IT ALL OF US
CANNOT REMEMBER A SINGLE THING

04:58.790 --> 05:00.496
FROM LAST NIGHT?
[cell phones rIng]

05:00.530 --> 05:02.498
- STROBE.
RIGHT.

05:02.530 --> 05:04.020
JUST GOT TOLD TO COME BACK
TO THE OFFICE.

05:04.070 --> 05:05.367
IT'S URGENT.

05:05.400 --> 05:08.369
- I JUST GOT THE SAME CALL.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.834
WHERE'S MY KEYS?

05:10.870 --> 05:13.634
I DON'T SEE MY CAR OUT THERE.

05:13.680 --> 05:14.999
MY FORD FUSION IS MISSING.

05:15.040 --> 05:16.644
- NOW CAN WE ALL START
FREAKING OUT?

05:16.680 --> 05:18.545
- AAH!
- EVERYONE RELAX!

05:18.580 --> 05:19.740
WE'LL TAKE THE BLUEBERRY.

05:19.780 --> 05:22.385
AND WE WILL RIDE CALMLY,
ELOQUENTLY,

05:22.420 --> 05:24.547
AND PROFESSIONALLY,
LIKE GENTLEMEN.

05:24.590 --> 05:26.387
- HMM.

05:26.420 --> 05:28.081
NICE PARKING JOB, GUSTER.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.122
- HOW DO YOU EVEN KNOW
HE WAS DRIVING?

05:30.160 --> 05:33.789
- OKAY, IF NO ONE ELSE
IS GONNA FREAK OUT,

05:33.830 --> 05:35.627
THEN I WILL.

05:35.660 --> 05:37.366
OH, MY GOSH!

05:37.400 --> 05:39.095
OH, MY GOSH!
DO YOU SEE MY CAR?

05:39.130 --> 05:40.563
DO YOU SEE MY CAR?

05:40.600 --> 05:42.659
MY CAR!

05:42.710 --> 05:44.507
- IT'S JUST
A MINOR DING, BUDDY.

05:44.540 --> 05:45.461
YOU CAN ONLY SEE IT

05:45.510 --> 05:47.535
BECAUSE THE SUN'S HITTING IT
AT THAT ANGLE.

05:47.580 --> 05:49.070
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, WOODY?

05:49.110 --> 05:50.805
- I DON'T FEEL RIGHT INSIDE.

05:50.850 --> 05:53.375
- OH, MY GOSH!
OH, GOD!

05:53.420 --> 05:55.672
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS!
OH, MY GOSH! OH, MY GOSH!

05:55.720 --> 05:58.416
DO YOU SEE MY CAR?
DO YOU SEE MY CAR?

05:59.960 --> 06:03.088
- OKAY, WE HAVE
A MALE JOHN DOE, CAUCASIAN,

06:03.130 --> 06:04.188
405--

06:04.230 --> 06:05.982
DETECTIVE LASSITER,
WHY ARE YOU WEARING SUNGLASSES

06:06.030 --> 06:07.099
AT AN AUTOPSY?

06:07.130 --> 06:09.963
- I, UM...
- CHIEF, IF I MAY...

06:10.000 --> 06:11.820
LASSIE SPOKE TO US ALL
ABOUT A WEEK AGO

06:11.870 --> 06:13.929
ABOUT WEARING SUNGLASSES
TO ALL AUTOPSIES

06:13.970 --> 06:16.564
MOVING FORWARD TO SHOW RESPECT
FOR THE DEAD.

06:16.610 --> 06:18.100
I SIMPLY FORGOT,
AND GUS REFUSED,

06:18.140 --> 06:20.404
BECAUSE HE HAS NO VALUE
FOR HUMAN LIFE.

06:20.440 --> 06:21.976
- BODY WAS DREDGED

06:22.010 --> 06:24.979
FROM THE WATER NEAR ARROYO BEACH
LATE THIS MORNING--

06:25.010 --> 06:27.945
SHOT THREE TIMES.

06:27.980 --> 06:31.086
- IT'S MISSING THREE BULLETS.
I CAN TELL BY THE WEIGHT.

06:31.120 --> 06:33.418
- UH, HOW MANY TIMES?

06:33.460 --> 06:34.813
- THREE. WHY?

06:34.860 --> 06:38.057
- HMM.

06:48.870 --> 06:52.499
[The Friendly Indians'
I Know You Know]

06:52.540 --> 06:56.579
- * I KNOW YOU KNOW
THAT I'M NOT TELLING THE TRUTH *

06:56.610 --> 06:59.477
* I KNOW YOU KNOW
THEY JUST DON'T HAVE ANY PROOF *

06:59.520 --> 07:01.647
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION

07:01.680 --> 07:03.079
* LEARN HOW TO BEND

ROLLS IN,

07:13.660 --> 07:14.558
IT BECOMES A TOP PRIORITY.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.023
SOMEONE OUT THERE
MURDERED THIS PERSON,

07:17.070 --> 07:18.867
AND WITHOUT AN IDENTITY,

07:18.900 --> 07:21.164
WE HAVE NO CLUES TO GO ON.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.566
BUT IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY
TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS

07:23.610 --> 07:26.909
AND BRING THE PERP IN
AND BRING THEM TO JUSTICE.

07:26.940 --> 07:30.671
NOW, I WANT TO START WITH
ANY OPEN MISSING-PERSONS CASES

07:30.710 --> 07:33.042

AN EMPTY WALLET,

07:43.090 --> 07:45.058
AND A PAIR OF SHOES,

07:45.090 --> 07:47.058
WHICH ARE NOT EVEN
THE VICTIM'S CORRECT SIZE.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.523
NOW, I'D LIKE
ALL HANDS ON DECK FOR THIS,

07:49.570 --> 07:51.891
BUT BECAUSE YOU AND O'HARA
ARE DUE TO TESTIFY

07:51.930 --> 07:53.761

07:53.800 --> 07:55.199
- OH, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S OKAY, CHIEF.

07:55.240 --> 07:57.128
O'HARA CAN G0.
I DON'T NEED TO BE THERE.

07:57.170 --> 07:59.263
SHE WAS ACTUALLY THE ONE
WHO WAS GOING TO TESTIFY.

07:59.310 --> 08:01.870
I WAS JUST GOING TO LEND
MY PRESENCE FOR THE JURY.

08:01.910 --> 08:03.798
- SERIOUSLY?
- DEAD SERIOUS.

08:03.850 --> 08:04.703
YES. NO.

08:04.750 --> 08:07.014
I MEAN, YES,
THERE IS A DEAD MAN HERE,

08:07.050 --> 08:09.917
AND IT IS TRAGIC, AWFUL,
BUT I CAN HANDLE IT.

08:09.950 --> 08:12.214
PLUS, I'VE GOT SHAWN AND GUS
TO HELP.

08:12.250 --> 08:15.913

TO WORK WITH SHAWN AND GUS?

08:15.960 --> 08:18.155
WHAT IS GOING ON? AND PLEASE
TAKE THOSE SUNGLASSES OFF.

08:18.190 --> 08:20.158
- YOU PUT SOME SUNGLASSES ON!

08:20.200 --> 08:22.794

08:35.610 --> 08:37.601

08:39.280 --> 08:41.111
WHAT THE HELL WAS GOING ON
IN THERE?

08:41.150 --> 08:43.209
- I WAS ABOUT TO ASK YOU
THE SAME THING--YOU SEEM GRUMPS.

08:43.250 --> 08:44.649
- I'M NOT GRUMPS.
- WHO'S GRUMPS?

08:44.690 --> 08:46.248
- SHAWN, I DIDN'T GET
ANY SLEEP LAST NIGHT.

08:46.290 --> 08:47.587
AREN'T YOU GONNA SAY ANYTHING

08:47.620 --> 08:49.087
ABOUT THE PHONE CALL
YOU MADE TO ME?

08:49.120 --> 08:52.123
IT'S--IT'S KIND OF A HUGE DEAL.

YES, OF COURSE, OBVIOUSLY,
IT IS HUGE, ISN'T IT?

- DOES GUS KNOW ABOUT THIS?

08:57.370 --> 08:59.736
- WHY--WHY WOULDN'T HE?

08:59.770 --> 09:03.206
SOMETHING OF THIS MAGNITUDE--
IT'S HUGE.

09:03.240 --> 09:04.434
AND WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT,

09:04.470 --> 09:07.007

09:20.660 --> 09:22.252
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED
LAST NIGHT?

09:22.290 --> 09:24.724

I THINK
I'M GONNA TURN MYSELF IN.

09:29.930 --> 09:31.795
- WHAT, FOR SPOONING
WITH WOODY?

09:31.830 --> 09:33.969
- WE DID NOTHING WRONG.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.638
- LOOK, GUYS, WE HAVE SOME

09:35.670 --> 09:38.309
OF THE FINEST
CRIME-SOLVING MINDS IN THE WORLD

09:38.340 --> 09:39.739
RIGHT HERE IN THIS ROOM.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.179
AND I THINK YOU BOUGHT US
A FEW HOURS

09:41.210 --> 09:42.677
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED HERE

09:42.710 --> 09:44.302
BEFORE WE GO SOUNDING OFF
ANY ALARMS.

09:44.350 --> 09:46.978
LASSIE, I NEED YOU
TO LOOK INWARDS.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.817
TAKE A SWIM IN LAKE YOU.

09:48.850 --> 09:51.045
SEE WHAT YOU SEE.
WE CAN DO THIS.

09:51.090 --> 09:54.059
- SPENCER, I CAN'T SURVIVE
WITHOUT THE FACTS.

09:54.090 --> 09:56.081
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT.

09:56.120 --> 09:58.088
I NEVER LOST CONTROL
OF MY FACULTIES IN MY LIFE.

09:58.130 --> 09:59.381
- ME NEITHER.

09:59.430 --> 10:01.648
UNLESS I'M BEING TICKLED--
THEN ALL BETS ARE OFF.

10:01.700 --> 10:03.395
- WHAT ABOUT ME, FELLAS?

10:03.430 --> 10:05.193
I'M NOT HAVING
ANY PSYCHIC VISIONS,

10:05.230 --> 10:07.334
FLASHBACKS,
OR RE-CREATION FLASHBACKS,

10:07.370 --> 10:10.168
OR RE-CREATION FLASHBACKS
WITH NEW PSYCHIC VISIONS.

10:10.210 --> 10:11.666
I MEAN, IMAGINE
YOU WEREN'T JUST

10:11.710 --> 10:14.304
A BLAND, GANGLY,
AVERAGE HUMAN, HUH?

10:14.340 --> 10:17.673
THAT YOU COULD WINK AT SOMEONE
AND--AND LIGHT UP THEIR WORLD,

10:17.710 --> 10:19.075
THAT YOU COULD MAKE
A CHILD THINK

10:19.110 --> 10:20.816
THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN THEM
AN ICE CREAM CONE

10:20.850 --> 10:22.681
WITHOUT GIVING THEM THE CONE

10:22.720 --> 10:25.086
AND THEN WATCH THEM SKIP OFF
INTO A BEAUTIFUL MEADOW,

10:25.120 --> 10:26.348
LICKING NOTHING BUT AIR!

10:26.390 --> 10:27.948
IMAGINE THAT!

10:27.990 --> 10:29.958
IMAGINE THAT YOU HAVE
A SPECIAL GII-T,

10:29.990 --> 10:32.356
A SIXTH SENSE, AND THEN SOMEONE
OR SOMETHING COMES ALONG

10:32.390 --> 10:34.096
AND RIPS IT AWAY FROM YOU!

10:34.130 --> 10:36.690
IMAGINE THAT, JACK!

10:36.730 --> 10:39.392
DO YOU SEE ME GIVING UP?

10:41.400 --> 10:44.107
- OKAY, SHAWN.

10:44.140 --> 10:46.267
OKAY.

10:46.310 --> 10:48.369
DAMN IT, I CANNOT BELIEVE
I AM SAYING THIS,

10:48.410 --> 10:50.344
BUT, MEN, WE ARE
IN THIS TOGETHER.

10:50.380 --> 10:52.974
OBVIOUSLY WE KNEW THE VICTIM.
- WELL, WE ALL KNEW THE VICTIM,

10:53.020 --> 10:54.373
BUT YOU ARE THE ONE
WHO SHOT HIM.

10:54.420 --> 10:55.717
- YOU HAD THE DEAD GUY'S PHONE.

10:55.750 --> 10:57.240
- SHAWN WAS WEARING
THE MAN'S SANDALS.

10:57.290 --> 10:59.144
- HUH. I WAS HOPING
YOU GUYS DIDN'T NOTICE THAT.

10:59.190 --> 11:01.852
- LOOK, I DON'T CARE
IF WE DID KILL THIS GUY.

11:01.890 --> 11:03.255
I'M JUST HAPPY
TO BE A PART OF IT.

11:03.290 --> 11:05.258
- DO NOT TOUCH ME AGAIN.
GUSTER, GIVE ME YOUR PHONE.

11:05.290 --> 11:06.848
IT'S EVIDENCE.
- I NEED MY PHONE.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.219
I'M THE ONLY ONE HERE
WITH A DAY JOB.

11:08.260 --> 11:09.090
I NEED IT FOR WORK.

11:09.130 --> 11:10.995
- I AM IN CHARGE
AND CALLING THE SHOTS.

11:11.030 --> 11:12.395
- IT IS EVIDENCE.
PUT IT IN.

11:12.430 --> 11:14.432
- FINE.

11:16.440 --> 11:18.260
- ALL RIGHT, FINE.
YOU CAN HANG ON TO THE PHONE.

11:18.310 --> 11:20.130
BUT IT NEVER COMES OUT
OF THE BAG--DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

11:20.180 --> 11:21.238
- GOT IT.

11:21.280 --> 11:23.874
- THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
WE SHOULD DO AT THIS POINT.

11:23.910 --> 11:25.377
WE ALL HAVE TO PEE
INTO A CUP.

11:25.410 --> 11:26.911
- [sighs] AMEN.

11:26.950 --> 11:28.872
- THAT IS AN EXCELLENT IDEA.
I COULDN'T AGREE MORE.

11:28.920 --> 11:30.410
THERE'S OBVIOUSLY
ONLY ONE REASON

11:30.450 --> 11:32.441
THAT NONE OF US REMEMBER
WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT.

11:32.490 --> 11:34.879
WE WERE DRUGGED.
- THAT IS ALSO A POSSIBILITY.

11:34.920 --> 11:37.753
HEY, I'LL RUN SOME TESTS,
SEE WHAT TURNS UP.

11:38.960 --> 11:41.758
- YES, I WILL HOLD.
JUST TELL HIM TO HURRY UP.

11:41.800 --> 11:43.290
- DO YOU REMEMBER ME
CALLING JULES LAST NIGHT?

11:43.330 --> 11:45.161
- YOU CALLED JULIET LAST NIGHT?
- APPARENTLY.

11:45.200 --> 11:47.031
YOU DON'T THINK I TOLD HER ABOUT
LASSIE SHOOTING HIS GUN, DO YOU?

11:47.070 --> 11:48.890
- I CERTAINLY HOPE NOT.
- [sighs]

11:51.240 --> 11:52.901
- WELL, TAKE A LOOK AT IT.
- I NEED YOU TO GET DOWN THERE

11:52.940 --> 11:54.168
AND PRETEND
LIKE YOU'RE TYING YOUR SHOE.

11:54.210 --> 11:56.178
- I'M NOT DOING THAT.
YOU DO IT.

11:56.210 --> 11:57.905
- I DON'T HAVE ANY LACES.
- SO?

11:57.950 --> 11:59.303
- SO WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO TIE--YOUR FACE?

11:59.350 --> 12:02.046
- FINE.

12:02.080 --> 12:05.015
- MCNAB, FINALLY.
PUT YOUR LISTENING EARS ON.

12:05.050 --> 12:07.086
I NEED YOU TO PUT OUT
AN OFFICIAL A.P.B.

12:07.120 --> 12:08.781
ON A BLACK FORD FUSION.

12:08.820 --> 12:11.152
YES, I'M AWARE THAT I DRIVE
A BLACK FORD FUSION.

12:11.190 --> 12:14.159
MCNAB, WOULD YOU JUST DO
WHAT I ASK YOU, PLEASE?

12:14.200 --> 12:15.428
NO, I AM NOT.

12:15.460 --> 12:18.167
I-I DON'T REMEMBER THE LICENSE
PLATE OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD.

12:18.200 --> 12:20.031
THANK YOU.

12:20.070 --> 12:22.334
WHY IS IT ALWAYS
SO DIFFICULT WITH YOU?

12:22.370 --> 12:24.065
NO.

12:24.110 --> 12:25.907
I DON'T REALLY WANT TO GO
TO LUNCH TODAY.

12:25.940 --> 12:28.909
RAIN CHECK.

12:28.940 --> 12:32.478
- [sniffs] I'M SENSING THAT OUR
VICTIM WAS SOME KIND OF STALKER.

12:32.510 --> 12:34.478
- STALKER?
- YEAH, I GET A VISION, UH...

12:34.520 --> 12:38.115
OF A BLOND WOMAN--ATTRACT IVE
IN A SOCCER MOM SORT OF WAY,

12:38.150 --> 12:39.185
KIND OF TERI GARR-ESQUE.

12:39.220 --> 12:42.109
- OKAY...

12:42.160 --> 12:43.525
FIRST OFF, I DIDN'T REALIZE

12:43.560 --> 12:45.824
PEYOTE STAYED IN YOUR SYSTEM
THAT MANY YEARS.

12:45.860 --> 12:47.088
I HAVE ONLY MYSELF

12:47.130 --> 12:49.098
AND MY THEN-GIRLFRIEND,
LOLLIPOP, TO BLAME.

12:49.130 --> 12:53.134
SECONDLY, GUSTER,
YOUR CHOLESTEROL IS REALLY HIGH.

12:53.170 --> 12:54.865
- MAN, I TOLD YOU EATING
SOMETHING CALLED

12:54.900 --> 12:56.390
"STICK O' BUTTER IN A BUN"
WAS A BAD IDEA.

12:56.440 --> 12:59.329
- I CAN'T HELP IT, SHAWN.
MY BODY CRAVES BUTTERY GOODNESS.

12:59.370 --> 13:01.133
- YOU ARE BUTTERY.
- YOU KNOW THAT'S RIGHT.

13:01.180 --> 13:03.205
- ACT NATURAL.

13:03.250 --> 13:07.414
[footsteps]

13:07.450 --> 13:09.839
- ALL RIGHT, NOW,
HERE'S THE SKINNY.

13:09.890 --> 13:11.380
WE ALL HAD COPIOUS AMOUNTS

13:11.420 --> 13:13.854
OF SALVIA DIVINORUM
IN OUR SYSTEM.

13:13.890 --> 13:15.448
THAT'S A PSYCHOACT IVE HERB

13:15.490 --> 13:17.526
THAT CAN CAUSE HALLUCINATIONS
AND "DISASSOCIATIVE" EFFECTS.

13:17.560 --> 13:19.118
WE WERE ALL DRUGGED
AT THAT BAR.

13:19.160 --> 13:21.128
- I KNEW IT.
- HOWEVER...

13:21.160 --> 13:23.367
OUR VICTIM HAD NO TRACE OF
THE DRUG AT ALL--HE WAS CLEAN.

13:23.400 --> 13:25.823
- WHY WOULD SOMEONE SPIKE
OUR DRINK BUT NOT HIS?

13:25.870 --> 13:26.791
- WELL, CLEARLY SOMEONE

13:26.840 --> 13:28.990
WAS TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF US SEXUALLY,

13:29.040 --> 13:31.508
OR AT LEAST ME.

13:38.910 --> 13:40.013
- NOT LAST NIGHT, LASSIE.

13:40.050 --> 13:41.119
- OR IN THIS LAST DECADE.

13:41.150 --> 13:43.414
- I AM SENSING THAT WE WERE
THE RECIPIENTS OF DRUGS

13:43.450 --> 13:47.250
THAT WERE INTENDED
FOR A PAIR OF WOMEN.

13:47.290 --> 13:49.349
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S HIT THAT BAR.

13:49.390 --> 13:52.450
- YEAH,
LET'S SHAKE THEM DOWN.

13:53.460 --> 13:55.997
- WHAT?
NO SHAKEDOWN?

- CARLTON LASSITER, S.B.P.D.

14:14.550 --> 14:16.518
I GOT SOME HARD QUESTIONS.
I NEED SOME STRAIGHT ANSWERS.

14:16.550 --> 14:20.179
HAS ANYONE TURNED IN
SOME FORD FUSION KEYS

14:20.220 --> 14:22.415
OR ACTUALLY
THE FORD FUSION ITSELF?

14:22.460 --> 14:25.429
- NO.
- DAMN IT.

14:25.460 --> 14:28.190
- HEY, MAN,
YOU RECOGNIZE THAT GUY?

14:30.100 --> 14:32.466
- UH, YEAH.
YEAH, HE WAS HERE LAST NIGHT.

14:32.500 --> 14:34.058
UM, BUT WHY ARE YOU GUYS
ASKING ME?

14:34.100 --> 14:35.465
I MEAN, YOU WERE BEST FRIENDS
WITH THE DUDE--

14:35.500 --> 14:36.535
BUYING HIM DRINKS ALL NIGHT.

14:36.570 --> 14:37.662
- UH, I WASN'T BUYING

14:37.710 --> 14:41.202
SOME SANDAL-WEARING WHITE GUY
A BUNCH OF DRINKS, OKAY?

14:41.240 --> 14:42.901
THAT'S NOT ME.

14:42.950 --> 14:45.043
- THIS GUY WAS SUCKING BACK
SODA WATER AND LIMES.

14:45.080 --> 14:48.618
- AHA. THAT'S WHY HE
DIDN'T HAVE DRUGS IN HIS SYSTEM.

14:48.650 --> 14:51.210
YOU KNOW, I'M REALLY STARTING
TO LIKE THIS COP STUFF.

14:51.250 --> 14:53.218
[whispering] WHEN ARE WE GONNA
PLANT SOME EVIDENCE ON THIS GUY?

14:53.260 --> 14:55.080
- STOP BREATHING ON MY NECK.
- THAT'S JUST HOW I BREATHE.

14:55.120 --> 14:57.088
- WOULD YOU--WOULD YOU GIVE ME
SOME PERSONAL SPACE?

14:57.130 --> 14:59.155
- I WILL GIVE YOU
WHATEVER YOU NEED.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.960
- I'M GETTING SOMETHING.
I'M SEEING A GUY--

15:04.000 --> 15:07.163
LIKE, A--HE'S LIKE
A SWEDISH VERSION OF JON CRYER--

ON THOSE GIRLS LAST NIGHT.

15:27.020 --> 15:28.385

THEIR DRINKS,

15:28.420 --> 15:30.320

17:53.370 --> 17:56.692
- ALL RIGHT.
IT'S 805...

18:00.240 --> 18:01.798
- I GOT IT!
EVERYBODY, I GOT IT.

18:01.840 --> 18:04.547
IT'S--IT'S GOOD.
THIS IS--

18:04.580 --> 18:06.138
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- LOOKING FOR MY KEYS.

18:06.180 --> 18:07.579
THOSE THINGS
ARE EXPENSIVE TO REPLACE.

18:07.620 --> 18:08.678
- DOUBLE GOOD NEWS--

18:08.720 --> 18:10.813
I KNOW WHERE WE WENT
WHEN WE LEI-T THE BAR LAST NIGHT.

18:10.850 --> 18:13.318
AND, UH, WOODY, YOU DON'T HAVE
A COCAINE PROBLEM.

18:14.660 --> 18:16.412
- SHAWN, RIGHT NOW I'M MISSING
AN OPPORTUNITY

18:16.460 --> 18:18.826
TO CAPITALIZE
ON "LAST NIGHT GUS'" GAME,

18:18.860 --> 18:20.293
WHICH ITOLD YOU I HAD.

18:20.330 --> 18:22.651
- WELL, "TODAY GUS"
IS A WHINY BABY.

18:22.700 --> 18:23.792
WE'RE HERE FOR A CASE,

18:23.830 --> 18:26.492
AND IT'S NOT SOLVING THE MYSTERY
OF YOUR DARKENED LOINS.

18:26.530 --> 18:27.565
- THIS IS IT--

18:27.600 --> 18:29.488
A FREAKIN' DOUGHNUT SHOP?
- STAY WITH ME, LASSIE.

18:29.540 --> 18:32.304
THESE DOUGHNUTS HAVE
SOMETHING TO DO WITH OUR CASE,

18:32.340 --> 18:33.432
I PROMISE YOU THAT.

18:33.480 --> 18:34.435
- OW!
- MOVE.

18:34.480 --> 18:35.731
- JESUS.

18:35.780 --> 18:38.749
[bell chimes]

18:45.750 --> 18:46.842
- OH, I'M SENSING THIS GUY'S

18:46.890 --> 18:48.551
GONNA HELP US FILL IN
SOME BLANKS.

18:48.590 --> 18:50.455
- OH, NO, NO, NO, NO,
NOT YOU GUYS AGAIN.

18:50.490 --> 18:52.583
UH-UH, NO WAY.
- TOLD YOU.

18:52.630 --> 18:54.757
- LOOK, I ALREADY TOLD YOU,
MADE IT PERFECT LY CLEAR,

18:54.800 --> 18:55.824
I DON'T KNOW THAT WOMAN.

18:55.860 --> 18:57.919
- WELL, I'M SENSING
THAT YOU DO KNOW THAT WOMAN,

18:57.970 --> 18:59.267
THAT SHE WAS HERE.

18:59.300 --> 19:00.665
YOU TWO WERE FACE-TO-FACE.

19:00.700 --> 19:02.236
- WHAT, ARE YOU PSYCHIC?

19:02.270 --> 19:03.931
- YES, HE IS.
- NO, HE'S NOT.

19:03.970 --> 19:07.269
- OKAY, FINE. SHE WAS HERE,
LIKE, TWO DAYS AGO,

19:07.310 --> 19:08.777
BUT SHE JUST BOUGHT
SOME BEAR CLAWS.

19:08.810 --> 19:09.902
I DIDN'T SLEEP WITH HER.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.601
- WE ASKED YOU IF YOU SLEPT
WITH HER?

19:11.650 --> 19:12.742
- COME ON, LOOK AT ME.

19:12.780 --> 19:13.940
DOES IT LOOK
LIKE I'M GOING AROUND

19:13.980 --> 19:17.211
TRYING TO BED A BUNCH OF BLOND
DESPERATE-HOUSEWIFE TYPES?

19:17.250 --> 19:19.639
LIKE THAT'S MY THING, 'CAUSE
THEY CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THIS?

19:19.690 --> 19:21.351
- I'M DRAWN TO YOU
IN A WEIRD SORT OF WAY.

19:21.390 --> 19:22.857
- MAYBE THEY RECOGNIZE YOU
FROM CHILDREN OF THE CORN.

19:22.890 --> 19:25.188
- MAYBE THEY KNOW YOU
FROM THE COSBY SHOW, BUD.

19:25.230 --> 19:27.391
- I'M NOT BUD.
- DID WE ASK YOU ANYTHING ELSE?

19:27.430 --> 19:28.624
- UH, NO, YOU WERE TOO BUSY

19:28.660 --> 19:30.366
TRYING ON
EVERYBODY ELSE'S SHOES.

19:30.400 --> 19:31.890
AND THEN THE ANGRY ONE
STOLE MY DOUGHNUT HAT.

19:31.930 --> 19:33.830
- WHY'S HE LOOKING AT ME?
I'M NOT THE ANGRY GUY.

19:33.870 --> 19:35.394
- YOU ARE PRETTY ANGRY.

19:38.240 --> 19:39.730
- OUR VICTIM
WASN'T A STALKER.

19:39.770 --> 19:42.637
HE WASN'T FOLLOWING THE WOMAN
BECAUSE HE WAS INTO HER.

19:42.680 --> 19:44.841
HE WAS ON A CASE.
HE WAS HIRED TO DO SO.

19:44.880 --> 19:46.643
- HE WAS ON THE JOB?
- HE WAS A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR.

19:46.680 --> 19:48.238
THAT'S PROBABLY
WHY WE BEFRIENDED HIM.

19:48.280 --> 19:49.372
WE WERE HELPING HIM.

19:49.420 --> 19:51.843
- I'M PRETTY SURE I WAS
HOOKING UP AT THE TIME--WHAT?

19:51.890 --> 19:52.845
- NO, THAT MAKES TOTAL SENSE.

19:52.890 --> 19:55.518
IT'S A SIMPLE
SNAP-AND-SHOOT ADULTERY CASE.

19:55.560 --> 19:56.549
I CAN SOLVE THAT IN MY SLEEP.

19:56.590 --> 19:58.649
YEAH, WE WERE HELPING HIM
LOOK FOR THE WOMAN.

19:58.690 --> 20:00.794
WE WERE FEELING GENEROUS.
- THAT'S WHAT IT WAS.

20:00.830 --> 20:03.663
- I HAD THE MUNCHIES.
I SHOULD POOP.

20:03.700 --> 20:05.793
ARE WE ALLOWED TO TAKE
A BATHROOM BREAK?

20:05.830 --> 20:07.991
I SHOULD'VE GONE AT THE BAR.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.508
- YOU OWE ME $31,
'CAUSE YOU LICKED THE SUGAR

20:10.540 --> 20:13.338
OFF ALL THE POWDERED DOUGHNUTS
LIKE A WEIRD SICKO.

20:13.380 --> 20:15.234
- [gaSPSJ
OH.

20:15.280 --> 20:16.736
- OH, THIS IS GOOD.
THIS FEELS GOOD.

20:16.780 --> 20:17.849
THIS IS GRE--
[clattering]

20:17.880 --> 20:19.541
WE FINALLY HAVE A HANDLE
ON WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT.

20:19.580 --> 20:21.411
- HEY!
YOU KILLED BOBO!

20:23.850 --> 20:26.546
- OR THERE COULD STILL BE

20:26.590 --> 20:29.479
A FEW DETAILS
FLOATING AROUND OUT THERE.

20:32.430 --> 20:35.797
- OKAY, JUST TAKE IT EASY.
NOBODY KILLED ANYBODY.

20:35.830 --> 20:37.627
- ACTUALLY, LASSIE, YOU--
YOU MIGHT HAVE KILLED SOMEONE.

20:37.670 --> 20:39.820
- SHH!
- BOBO'S DEAD.

20:39.870 --> 20:41.929
- SHH.
- AND YOU'RE GONNA PAY.

20:41.970 --> 20:44.734
- WHO THE HELL IS BOBO?

20:46.970 --> 20:48.130
- OH, COME ON.

20:48.180 --> 20:51.707
I'M HEAD DETECTIVE OF THE
SANTA BARBARA POLICE DEPARTMENT.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.445
YOU BETTER HAVE
SOME VERY SERIOUS EVIDENCE

20:53.480 --> 20:55.573
IF YOU'RE GONNA ACCUSE ME
OF VANDALISM LIKE THAT.

20:55.620 --> 20:58.316
- COME ON, LASSIE!
COME ON! OH!

20:58.350 --> 21:01.456
[indistinct shouting]

21:01.490 --> 21:02.787
[tires screeching]

21:02.820 --> 21:03.957
- [chuckles]

21:03.990 --> 21:05.685
- YOU'RE IDIOTS.
- IT'S ALMOST COOL.

21:05.730 --> 21:08.722
[loud creaking]

21:08.760 --> 21:10.990
[gunshots]

21:12.370 --> 21:14.736
- THERE, SEE?
I DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY.

21:14.770 --> 21:16.635
[Woody laughing]

21:16.670 --> 21:18.433
- YOU SON OF A BITCH!
- BACK UP.

21:18.470 --> 21:19.732
- THAT JERK TOOK US OUT!

21:19.770 --> 21:21.533
- UH, UH, NOT SO FAST.

21:21.580 --> 21:23.002
- SON OF A BITCH.

21:26.080 --> 21:28.014
- SO THAT'S HOW LASSIE
GOT THE BLACK EYE.

21:28.050 --> 21:30.041
- BOBO.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.558
- I AM SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

21:37.590 --> 21:39.888
[cell phones ring]

21:39.930 --> 21:41.898
HELLO?
- GUTEN TAG.

21:41.930 --> 21:43.329
- THERE'S BEEN ANOTHER BODY.

21:43.370 --> 21:45.497
- I JUST GOT VERIFIED
ON TWITTER.

21:45.530 --> 21:47.430
- OH, THAT'S NICE, MAN.
- YEAH. THANKS.

21:47.470 --> 21:49.028
- OKAY, HERE WE ARE AGAIN.

21:49.070 --> 21:51.868
THIS IS SCOTT WILLIAMS, AGE 44,

21:51.910 --> 21:55.869
CAUCASIAN, FOUND DEAD IN HIS CAR
OFF OF SANTA VIEGO DRIVE.

21:55.910 --> 21:58.378
- THAT'S RIGHT DOWN THE BLOCK
FROM BOBO'S DONUTS.

21:58.410 --> 21:59.809
- WHAT BEARING DOES THAT HAVE,
MR. GUSTER?

21:59.850 --> 22:01.112
- FUN FACT.

22:01.150 --> 22:02.742
GUS IS MAKING A BOOK OF THEM.

22:02.780 --> 22:05.749
- IS THAT THE SAME GUY
THAT PUNCHED LASSIE?

22:09.960 --> 22:11.052
- [whispering]
YES, IT IS.

22:11.090 --> 22:12.648
- LACERATIONS
ON THE VICTIM'S KNUCKLES

22:12.690 --> 22:14.055
INDICATE
HE MAY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED

22:14.100 --> 22:16.056
IN A PHYSICAL ALTERCATION
PRIOR TO HIS DEATH.

22:16.100 --> 22:17.249
I CAN DO A SKIN TEST.

22:17.300 --> 22:20.064
NOW, IF THOSE KNUCKLES MADE
CONTACT WITH SOMEONE'S FACE,

22:20.100 --> 22:22.489
WE WILL FIND DNA IN THE CUTS.

22:22.540 --> 22:24.360
- WOODY!
- OR NOT.

22:24.410 --> 22:26.628
OR NOT.
DNA IS, UH...

22:26.670 --> 22:28.069
HARDLY CONCLUSIVE...

22:28.110 --> 22:30.499
REALLY SKETCHY AT BEST.

22:30.550 --> 22:32.802
[chuckles]
- WOODY, WHAT CAN YOU TELL US?

22:35.150 --> 22:39.940
- BASED ON SKIN COLOR
AND BLOOD COAGULATION,

22:39.990 --> 22:42.959
I'D SAY THIS GUY'S BEEN DEAD
FOR NO MORE THAN NINE HOURS.

22:42.990 --> 22:47.689
I'D PUT HIS T.O.D.
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 1:45 AND 2:30.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.558
- [whispering]
THROW OUT ANOTHER FUN FACT.

22:52.600 --> 22:54.067
- [whispering]
WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

22:54.100 --> 22:55.658
- JUST DO IT.
- FINE.

22:55.700 --> 22:57.463
CHIEF VICK...
- MM-HMM.

22:57.510 --> 23:00.001
- DID YOU KNOW THAT MORE PEOPLE
ARE KILLED BY DONKEYS ANNUALLY

23:00.040 --> 23:02.975
THAN DIE IN AIR CRASHES?
[cell phone Vibrating]

23:03.010 --> 23:06.446
- I AM SENSING THAT OUR JOHN DOE
FROM THIS MORNING

23:06.480 --> 23:09.142
AND MR. WILLIAMS HERE
ARE CONNECTED.

23:09.180 --> 23:10.818
I THINK THEY KNEW EACH OTHER.

23:10.850 --> 23:14.115
- OKAY.
WELL, THAT IS AT LEAST A LEAD.

23:14.160 --> 23:16.720
UH, DETECTIVE LASSITER,
O'HARA IS BACK ON THE CASE.

23:16.760 --> 23:18.079
YOU TWO SHOULD--
- TERRIFIC.

23:18.130 --> 23:21.554
- YOU TWO SHOULD FOLLOW
MR. SPENCER'S SCENT

23:21.600 --> 23:25.127
OVER TO MR. WILLIAMS'
RESIDENCE, OKAY?

23:25.170 --> 23:26.467
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO IT.

23:26.500 --> 23:28.866
- NOT YOU, SHAWN.
- OKAY.

23:28.900 --> 23:31.607
- DON'T WE HAVE TO TALK
ABOUT LAST NIGHT?

23:31.640 --> 23:33.471
- YES.

23:33.510 --> 23:37.708
- I MEAN, YOU--YOU DROP
THIS HUGE, SHOCKING INFORMATION

23:37.750 --> 23:39.172
OVER THE PHONE,

23:39.210 --> 23:40.848
AND THEN YOU JUST EXPECT ME
TO KEEP IT A SECRET?

23:40.880 --> 23:42.472
- I'M SORRY.
I DON'T--I DID--I JUST--

23:44.650 --> 23:46.186
I'M TRYING TO TAKE CARE
OF THIS THING MYSELF.

23:46.220 --> 23:48.586
- WELL, IT'S NOT
JUST ABOUT YOU, SHAWN.

23:48.620 --> 23:49.848
IT'S ABOUT US.

23:49.890 --> 23:52.529
I MEAN, WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER,
AND WE HAVE TO TRUST EACH OTHER.

23:52.560 --> 23:53.891
- OKAY, GREAT.
YOU'RE SO RIGHT.

23:53.930 --> 23:56.057
I JUST--WE'VE BEEN DANCING
AROUND THIS THING ALL DAY.

23:56.100 --> 23:58.022
NO ONE WILL JUST, YOU KNOW,
COME OUT WITH IT.

23:58.070 --> 23:59.628
I THINK WE SHOULD LAY IT
ALL ON THE LINE,

23:59.670 --> 24:01.934
LET THE CARDS FALL
WHERE THEY MAY,

24:01.970 --> 24:04.768
EVEN IF IT DESTROYS LIVES
IN THE PROCESS.

24:04.810 --> 24:06.004
- YOU ASKED ME TO MOVE IN
WITH YOU.

24:06.040 --> 24:07.109
- LASSIE KILLED WILLIAMS.

24:07.140 --> 24:08.732
- LASSITER KILLED WILLIAMS?

24:08.780 --> 24:09.838
- MOVE IN?

24:09.880 --> 24:12.041
WE--WE'VE ONLY BEEN TOGETHER
FOR, LIKE, FOUR MONTHS.

24:12.080 --> 24:14.514
- AGAIN,
LASSITER KILLED THIS MAN?

24:14.550 --> 24:15.915
- I DON'T THINK HE DID,
NOT ANYMORE.

24:15.950 --> 24:19.113
I'LL EXPLAIN ON THE WAY.
WE HAVE TO GET TO HIS HOUSE.

24:21.860 --> 24:24.522
- WAIT. SO ALL OF THAT
HAPPENED LAST NIGHT?

24:24.560 --> 24:25.925
HOW COULD YOU KEEP THAT
FROM ME?

24:25.960 --> 24:27.655
- WHICH ONE OF THESE HOUSES
IS TERI HATCHER'S?

24:27.700 --> 24:28.928
I'M NOT KEEPING STUFF
FROM YOU.

24:28.960 --> 24:30.518
I JUST DON'T REMEMBER
WHAT HAPPENED.

24:30.570 --> 24:31.923
I EXPECT SOMEONE
TO COME AROUND EVERY CORNER,

24:31.970 --> 24:33.119
SAYING, "NOT YOU AGAIN."

24:33.170 --> 24:34.933
DON'T DO IT, MA'AM.
PLEASE DON'T.

24:34.970 --> 24:39.066
- SO, IF YOU TECHNICALLY
DON'T REMEMBER ASKING ME,

24:39.110 --> 24:40.668
DO YOU STILL WANT TO MOVE IN?

24:40.710 --> 24:42.530
- WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
OF COURSE I DO.

24:42.580 --> 24:44.673
OF COURSE. WHY ELSE
WOULD I BE SHRINK-WRAPPING

24:44.710 --> 24:47.076
ALL MY OLD SWEATERS TO MAKE ROOM
IN THE CLOSET FOR YOURS?

24:47.110 --> 24:48.941
- I JUST THINK YOU LIKE
TO SHRINK-WRAP THINGS.

24:48.980 --> 24:50.538
- [sighs]

24:50.590 --> 24:53.684
THAT'S TRUE.
IT'S FUN TO WATCH THINGS SHRINK.

24:53.720 --> 24:54.948
- SHE JUST TEXTED ME AGAIN.

24:54.990 --> 24:56.810
SHE CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF ME.

24:56.860 --> 24:59.078
I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT LINE
"LAST NIGHT GUS" LAID ON HER.

24:59.130 --> 25:00.688
I NEED
"LAST NIGHT" GUS, SHAWN.

25:00.730 --> 25:02.550
- MAN, I'VE GOT
MY OWN PROBLEMS.

25:02.600 --> 25:04.966
"LAST NIGHT SHAWN"
WAS ALL EVOLVED AND MATURE

25:05.000 --> 25:06.228
AND NOT A COMMITMENT-PHOBE.

25:06.270 --> 25:09.967
"TODAY SHAWN" IS VERY MUCH
A COMMITMENT-PHOBE.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.537
- ALL RIGHT, WE'RE DEALING WITH
A SINGLE GUY, POSSIBLY A LONER.

25:12.570 --> 25:14.572
DOBSON, YOU START SHAKING DOWN
ALL HIS COWORKERS.

25:14.610 --> 25:17.841
I WANT THIS PLACE DUSTED
AND PROCESSED IN THE NEXT HOUR.

25:17.880 --> 25:18.949
LET'S GO!

25:18.980 --> 25:21.210
- ALL RIGHT, THERE IS NO WAY
A STRAIGHT, SINGLE GUY

25:21.250 --> 25:22.672
PICKED OUT THOSE DRAPES.

25:22.720 --> 25:25.109
- I LIKE THOSE DRAPES, SHAWN.
THEY'RE STATELY.

25:25.150 --> 25:28.119
- OKAY, HOW MANY GUYS YOU KNOW
THAT PEE SITTING DOWN?

25:28.160 --> 25:29.855
- I PEE SITTING DOWN, SHAWN.

25:29.890 --> 25:31.118
ALL THE MEN'S HEALTH JOURNALS

25:31.160 --> 25:33.720
SAY IT'S BETTER
FOR YOUR CIRCULATION.

25:33.760 --> 25:35.591
- REMEMBER WHEN WE TALKED
ABOUT INSIDE VOICE?

25:35.630 --> 25:36.858
- I'M USING MY INSIDE VOICE.

25:36.900 --> 25:41.132
- OKAY, NOW IT'S TIME TO LEARN
ABOUT NO VOICE.

25:41.170 --> 25:42.762
ALL RIGHT...

25:42.800 --> 25:45.735
YOU CANNOT POSSIBLY TELL ME THAT
YOU KEEP POTPOURRI

25:45.770 --> 25:46.998
IN YOUR UNDERWEAR DRAWER.

25:47.040 --> 25:48.871
THERE WAS A WOMAN HERE.

25:48.910 --> 25:51.879
WILLIAMS
DOES NOT LIVE ALONE.

25:51.910 --> 25:53.616
- LOOK WHAT I FOUND
IN THE TRASH.

25:53.650 --> 25:55.948
SOMEBODY PUT THEIR FIST
THROUGH THIS PICTURE.

25:55.980 --> 25:58.244
- I'LL BE DAMNED.

25:58.290 --> 26:00.758
THAT BLOND IS THE WOMAN
IN THE PHOTOS ON THE PHONE.

26:00.790 --> 26:01.882
SHE'S WILLIAMS' WIFE.

26:01.920 --> 26:04.286
HE HIRED THE P.I. TO FIND
EVIDENCE OF HER CHEATING.

26:04.330 --> 26:05.922
SHE FOUND OUT
HE WAS DOING THIS...

26:05.960 --> 26:07.154
- AND SHE KILLED THEM BOTH.

26:07.190 --> 26:08.623
- IF THIS IS TRUE,
THEN WE ARE DEALING

26:08.660 --> 26:09.797
WITH ONE COLD-BLOODED KILLER.

26:09.830 --> 26:11.923
WE BETTER FIND HER BEFORE
MORE BODIES START PILING UP.

26:11.970 --> 26:14.165
- THIS WAS WAY EASIER WHEN WE
THOUGHT LASSIE WAS THE MURDERER.

26:14.200 --> 26:16.088
[cell phone vibrating]
I'M JUST SAYING.

26:16.140 --> 26:18.199
TOM WOPAT'S OFFICE.

26:20.940 --> 26:22.339
DAD, JUST CALM DOWN.

26:22.380 --> 26:24.302
- SHAWN, I DON'T KNOW
WHY I'M HERE, BUT I WOKE UP

26:24.350 --> 26:26.773
IN SOME STRANGE MOTEL ROOM...

26:26.810 --> 26:28.038
T-THAT I APPARENTLY TRASHED.

26:28.080 --> 26:29.945
OH, MAN, I SCREWED UP
REALLY BAD.

26:33.420 --> 26:35.058
- IS IT THE SUNCREST MOTEL?

26:35.090 --> 26:37.684
- [grunting]

26:38.960 --> 26:40.655
YES.
YES, IT IS.

26:40.700 --> 26:42.850
HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT?

26:42.900 --> 26:45.221
- AND THEN THE ANGRY GUY
STOLE MY DOUGHNUT HAT.

26:45.270 --> 26:47.932
- OH, MAN, I-I KNOW--
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

26:47.970 --> 26:50.188
YOU WERE WITH US LAST NIGHT.
TELL ME, DO YOU, UH--

26:50.240 --> 26:52.629
DO YOU SEE A DOUGHNUT HAT
LAYING AROUND ANYWHERE THERE?

26:52.670 --> 26:54.706
- WHA--

26:56.980 --> 26:58.675
YES, I DO.
- OH, MY GOD.

26:58.710 --> 27:00.302
DAD, YOU'RE THE ANGRY ONE.

27:00.350 --> 27:03.342
- "BLOND, 5'7", 125 POUNDS."

27:03.380 --> 27:06.315
SHAWN, OH, I THINK I ORDERED UP
A LADY OF THE NIGHT.

27:06.350 --> 27:08.682
- DAD, THAT'S THE WOMAN
THE PRIVATE EYE WAS TAILING.

27:08.720 --> 27:10.688
WE MUST'VE LANDED THERE BECAUSE
WE THOUGHT SHE WAS SHOWING UP.

27:10.730 --> 27:12.049
- WHAT--WHAT--
WHAT PRIVATE EYE?

27:12.090 --> 27:13.421
- I'LL EXPLAIN
WHEN I GET THERE.

27:13.460 --> 27:15.690
- SHAWN...

27:15.730 --> 27:17.288
I'M NOT WEARING ANY PANTS.

27:17.330 --> 27:19.764
- DAD, SIT TIGHT.

27:19.800 --> 27:21.131
- SHAWN, COME ALONE.

27:21.170 --> 27:22.694
- I HAVE A VERY STRONG VISION

27:22.740 --> 27:25.106
ABOUT ANOTHER PLACE
WE MAY HAVE BEEN LAST NIGHT!

27:25.140 --> 27:26.368
THIS ONE
DOES NOT INVOLVE FOOD,

27:26.410 --> 27:28.674
SO PLEASE BRING SNACKS
IF YOU ARE PECKISH.

27:28.710 --> 27:30.109
- I JUST WANT TO GET HOME

27:30.140 --> 27:32.108
AND FORGET THIS WHOLE THING
EVER HAPPENED.

27:32.150 --> 27:34.710
- YEAH, Al-TER WE GO TO THE FRONT
DESK AND PAY FOR THAT TOWEL.

27:34.750 --> 27:37.071
I'M NOT GONNA BE AN ACCOMPLICE
TO YOUR PETTY THEl-T.

27:37.120 --> 27:38.348
_ 1--
- HEY. WHOA, HEY.

27:38.390 --> 27:39.584
- I TOLD YOU TO COME ALONE.

27:39.620 --> 27:42.259
- LOOK, DAD, WE'RE VERY CLOSE
TO SOLVING THIS THING, OKAY?

27:42.290 --> 27:44.281
WE NEED THEM.

27:46.290 --> 27:48.827
- CARLTON, GUS, JULIET.

27:48.860 --> 27:50.157
- WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED
TO YOU?

27:50.200 --> 27:52.259
- HUH? OH, OH, UH,
SHAWN CALLED ME UP

27:52.300 --> 27:53.995
AND TOLD ME YOU GUYS
WERE WORKING ON A CASE,

27:54.040 --> 27:55.996
TYING UP SOME LOOSE ENDS,
SO I, UH--

27:56.040 --> 27:59.134
I DECIDED TO RUSH DOWN HERE.

27:59.170 --> 28:02.003
OH, HELL WITH IT.
SCREW IT.

28:02.040 --> 28:03.701
I GUESS I SLEPT HERE
LAST NIGHT.

28:03.750 --> 28:05.741
- WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU WERE HERE, TOO?

28:05.780 --> 28:08.874
- WAIT. YOU WEREN'T
IN GUS' CAR WITH US.

28:08.920 --> 28:10.911
WHO DROVE YOU HERE?
- I KNOW WHO.

28:10.950 --> 28:12.281
- SHAWN,
ARE YOU GETTING A VISION?

28:12.320 --> 28:14.151
- IT'S NOT EXACTLY A VISION.

28:14.190 --> 28:15.452
UH...

28:19.790 --> 28:21.849
- I DON'T WANT
TO BE HERE ANYMORE.

28:21.900 --> 28:24.027
- I GUESS I WAS IN
NO CONDITION TO DRIVE.

28:24.070 --> 28:25.799
- DO YOU EVEN KNOW JIM?
- JIM WHO?

28:25.830 --> 28:27.320
- YOU GUYS AGAIN.

28:27.370 --> 28:29.338
- OH, CHRIST.

28:30.910 --> 28:33.879
- WHOA.
- YOU OWE ME 480 BUCKS.

28:33.910 --> 28:35.775
- WHAT?
- THAT--

28:35.810 --> 28:37.277
THAT IS NOT
A FLOTATION DEVICE.

28:37.310 --> 28:39.141
- ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS GETTING RIDICULOUS.

28:39.180 --> 28:41.774
I AM HEAD DETECTIVE OF THE
SANTA BARBARA POLICE DEPARTMENT.

28:41.820 --> 28:42.912
WE WERE HERE LAST NIGHT

28:42.950 --> 28:44.486
ON AN OFFICIAL
POLICE INVESTIGATION,

28:44.520 --> 28:47.080
AND I HARDLY THINK
WE WERE PULLING JUVENILE STUNTS.

28:47.120 --> 28:48.257
- I HAVE SECURITY VIDEO,

28:48.290 --> 28:50.053
IF YOU'D LIKE TO WATCH IT
FOR YOURSELF.

28:50.090 --> 28:51.387
- YOU SAID 480, RIGHT?
- YEAH.

28:51.430 --> 28:53.057
THAT BROAD YOU WERE WAITING FOR
LAST NIGHT--

28:53.090 --> 28:54.489
SHE FINALLY SHOWED UP
THIS MORNING.

28:54.530 --> 28:56.293
IN FACT,
SHE MIGHT STILL BE HERE.

28:56.330 --> 28:58.321
SHE NEVER CHECKED OUT.
- CAN YOU LEAD US TO HER ROOM?

28:58.370 --> 29:01.191
- CAN YOU GIVE ME THE CHECK?

29:11.510 --> 29:13.205
- WHAT IS THIS?
- SHAWN.

29:13.250 --> 29:15.138
- SORRY.

29:25.190 --> 29:27.226
[grunts]

29:27.260 --> 29:29.353
WHOEVER SHE WAS HAVING
THE AFFAIR WITH

29:29.400 --> 29:31.197
WAS HERE WITH HER.

29:33.470 --> 29:35.267
[air hissing]

29:35.300 --> 29:36.836
OH, MY GOD.

29:36.870 --> 29:38.508
EVERYBODY GET OUT OF HERE!

29:38.540 --> 29:40.758
TAKE COVER!

29:53.390 --> 29:54.982
AAH!

29:55.020 --> 29:58.387
[glass breaking]

30:12.210 --> 30:13.871
- DOES SOMEONE WANT
TO EXPLAIN TO ME

30:13.910 --> 30:15.434
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED
LAST NIGHT?

30:15.480 --> 30:17.004
- OKAY, I JUST WANT TO GO
ON RECORD

30:17.040 --> 30:18.507
AND SAY THAT I WAS
ON THAT COUCH FIRST.

30:18.550 --> 30:21.144
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT'S SUPPOSED TO MEAN.

30:21.180 --> 30:22.909
- [knocking on glass]

30:24.890 --> 30:27.313
- WHOA. E-EXCUSE ME.
MAY I HELP YOU?

30:27.350 --> 30:29.011
- MY BEEF AIN'T
WITH YOU, LADY.

30:29.060 --> 30:30.880
I NEED TO TALK
TO THESE TWO CATS RIGHT HERE.

30:30.930 --> 30:32.852
- MOTHER OF GOD.
- IT'S ED LOVER.

30:32.890 --> 30:35.154
- MR. SPENCER, WHAT IS ED LOVER
DOING IN MY OFFICE?

30:35.200 --> 30:36.895
- I GUESS YOUR MOTHER
NEVER TAUGHT YOU

30:36.930 --> 30:39.296
ABOUT TAKING
ANOTHER GROWN-ASS MAN'S BLING.

30:39.330 --> 30:41.639
- WAIT. THAT'S YOUR BLING?
- THIS IS MY BRAND, PLAYER.

30:41.670 --> 30:43.297
- DUDE, YOU TOOK
ED LOVER'S BLING?

30:43.340 --> 30:44.568
- I DON'T REMEMBER DOING IT.
I SWEAR.

30:44.610 --> 30:47.909
- COME ON, SON, YOU KNOW DAMN
WELL YOU SWIPED MY ULTRA BRITE

30:47.940 --> 30:49.976
WHILE I WAS ON THE DANCE FLOOR
GETTING MY FREAK ON.

30:50.010 --> 30:51.875
- WHO THE HELL IS ED LOVER?

30:51.910 --> 30:54.049
- COME ON, SON.
- COME ON, SON.

30:54.080 --> 30:55.911
I APOLOGIZE
FOR MY DAD'S LIFE.

30:55.950 --> 30:58.316
- SHAWN AND I ARE HUGE FANS,
MR. ED LOVER,

30:58.350 --> 31:00.181
IN CASE WE DIDN'T MENTION IT
LAST NIGHT.

31:00.220 --> 31:01.881
- HUH? I SHOULD WHIP BOTH
OF YOUR NARROW ASSES.

31:01.920 --> 31:03.581
WASTED HALF OF MY DAY
TRACKING YOU DOWN.

31:03.620 --> 31:05.588
COME ON, SON!

31:05.630 --> 31:08.451
GET THE "F" OUT OF HERE
WITH THAT BULL.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.456
- DID THAT--
WAS HE--

31:10.500 --> 31:13.469
[laughing]
WHAT A NIGHT.

31:13.500 --> 31:15.161
WHAT A NIGHT!

31:15.200 --> 31:16.462
- OKAY, PLEASE TELL ME

31:16.500 --> 31:18.309
THAT THAT IS GONNA BE
THE LAST INTERRUPTION.

31:18.340 --> 31:23.004
NOW, PEOPLE--
[cell phone ringing]

31:23.040 --> 31:24.473
- [chuckles]
WHAT'S UP, BABY?

31:24.510 --> 31:27.343
- LISTEN, MR. GUSTER, WE'RE ALL
HAPPY THAT YOU CAN MANAGE

31:27.380 --> 31:30.076
TO CAPTIVATE THE HON EYS
OR WHATEVER IT IS,

31:30.120 --> 31:31.485
BUT RIGHT NOW
YOU ARE ON MY TIME.

31:31.520 --> 31:34.182
- CAN YOU HOLD ON ONE SEC?

31:34.220 --> 31:37.656
ACTUALLY, CHIEF,
I'M ON MY TIME.

31:37.690 --> 31:39.954
I ALMOST LOST MY LIFE
AN HOUR AGO,

31:39.990 --> 31:41.218
AND I'M SICK OF IT.

31:41.260 --> 31:42.557
"LAST NIGHT GUS"
HAD IT RIGHT.

31:42.600 --> 31:44.989
AND I DON'T WANT TO SIT HERE
WASTING ANOTHER MOMENT

31:45.030 --> 31:47.624
WHEN I COULD BE LIVING THE LIFE
I WAS MEANT TO LIVE--

31:47.670 --> 31:49.638
BALLIN' AND SHOT-CALLIN'.

31:49.670 --> 31:52.138
SO, IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I'M GONNA KEEP IT ONE HUNDY

31:52.170 --> 31:54.638
AND TAKE THIS CALL.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.238
- BUDDY--
- SORRY, SHAWN.

31:56.280 --> 31:58.544
IT'S HARD OUT THERE
FOR A PIMP.

32:01.320 --> 32:03.948
- IT'S TRUE, CHIEF. HE'S GOT
TO MAKE MONEY FOR THE RENT.

32:03.990 --> 32:05.981
- I AM NOT EVEN GONNA BRING UP

32:06.020 --> 32:08.557
THE DESTRUCTION
OF BOBO THE DOUGHNUT MAN.

32:08.590 --> 32:09.989
- UH, CHIEF, IF I MAY...

32:10.020 --> 32:11.351
IN LIEU OF FLOWERS,

32:11.390 --> 32:13.654
DONATIONS CAN BE MADE
TO GLAZEDFORLIFE.COM.

32:13.690 --> 32:15.999
OW! OOH!
- I'LL GET YOU.

32:16.030 --> 32:18.225
- STOP IT!
- I WILL DESTROY YOU.

32:18.270 --> 32:19.965
- THIS IS NOT A JOKE...

32:20.000 --> 32:21.399
MR. SPENCER!

32:21.440 --> 32:23.135
THAT EXPLOSION
WAS MEANT TO KILL,

32:23.170 --> 32:25.229
AND THE KILLER
IS STILL OUT THERE.

32:25.270 --> 32:29.274
AND, HENRY SPENCER,
WHERE ARE YOUR PANTS?

32:29.310 --> 32:31.278
- I'M NOT
ENTIRELY SURE, KAREN.

32:31.310 --> 32:33.039
- HER NAME
IS GLORIA WILLIAMS, CHIEF,

32:33.080 --> 32:35.116
AND SHE
COULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN FAR.

32:35.150 --> 32:36.674
WE HAVE CONTACTED
EVERY TRANSPORTATION AGENCY

32:36.720 --> 32:38.119
IN AN EFFORT TO SLOW HER DOWN.

32:38.150 --> 32:40.380
- AND WHAT ARE WE DOING
STILL SITTING HERE?

32:40.420 --> 32:41.614
- AND THEN IT HIT ME--

32:41.660 --> 32:43.753
THE CALCULATED WAY IN WHICH
THESE MURDERS WERE COMMITTED,

32:43.790 --> 32:45.621
THE FIRE-BOMB AMBUSH
AT THE MOTEL,

32:45.660 --> 32:48.151
THE FACT THAT GLORIA WILLIAMS
HAS MANAGED TO DISAPPEAR

32:48.200 --> 32:49.349
WITHOUT A TRACE.

32:49.400 --> 32:51.163
THIS DOES NOT FIT
THE PROFILE

32:51.200 --> 32:52.724
OF YOUR TYPICAL
SUBURBAN HOUSEWIFE.

32:52.770 --> 32:56.035
- [whispering]
I AM SO BORED.

32:56.070 --> 32:57.628
- NOW, WE'VE BEEN
CONCENTRATING ON HER.

32:57.670 --> 32:59.433
BUT I DON'T THINK
SHE'S CAPABLE OF THIS.

32:59.470 --> 33:01.301
WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING
ON THE MEN

33:01.340 --> 33:03.171
THAT SHE WAS
IN THE PHOTOGRAPHS WITH.

33:03.210 --> 33:05.041
ONE OF THEM
COULD BE OUR KILLER.

33:05.080 --> 33:07.446
WE CAN ELIMINATE
THE DOUGHNUT GUY.

33:07.480 --> 33:09.710
HE SOLD HER SOME DOUGHNUTS.
- THAT'S THE HOTEL MANAGER.

33:09.750 --> 33:12.310
SO WE KNOW HE WAS PHOTOGRAPHED
WHEN SHE WAS CHECKING IN.

33:12.350 --> 33:16.059
- VALET, GROCERY BAGGER,

33:16.090 --> 33:18.024
HAIR STYLIST...

33:18.060 --> 33:20.221
- WHO'S THAT GUY?
- WHOA. HOLD UP.

33:21.630 --> 33:26.329
- I CAN'T HELP IT, SHAWN.
MY BODY CRAVES BUTTERY GOODNESS.

33:28.500 --> 33:30.639
- WE NEED TO SEE DWAYNE.
- WHO'S DWAYNE?

33:30.670 --> 33:33.730
- DWAYNE, MY MAN,
WE JUST DON'T SEE ENOUGH OF YOU.

33:33.770 --> 33:36.603
- THAT'S BECAUSE NOBODY
EVER UTILIZES MY SKILL SET.

33:36.640 --> 33:39.074
THEY FORGET ABOUT ME...
LITERALLY.

33:39.110 --> 33:41.214
THEY LOCKED ME IN HERE
OVER THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND.

33:41.250 --> 33:43.218
I SURVIVED ON THE MOISTURE
OF MY DESK CACTUS

33:43.250 --> 33:45.445
AND GIRL SCOUT COOKIES.
- MY GOD, THAT'S HORRIBLE.

33:45.490 --> 33:47.344
- I KNOW.
- SPENCER...

33:47.390 --> 33:49.210
WHY ARE WE HERE?
- OH, RIGHT.

33:49.260 --> 33:51.080
OKAY, HERE WE GO.
[clears throat]

33:51.130 --> 33:53.325
WE'RE GONNA LOSE THE CLEl-T CHIN
ON THE GUY IN THE CAFE.

33:53.360 --> 33:55.089
THANK YOU, SIR.

33:55.130 --> 33:57.155
UH, NOW LET'S GET RID
OF HIS WRINKLES

33:57.200 --> 33:58.724
ON THE FACE
AND THE NECK THERE.

33:58.770 --> 34:00.226
PERFECT.

34:00.270 --> 34:01.498
NOW WE WANT TO TAKE
THE LONG HAIR

34:01.540 --> 34:04.065
AND THE BEARD AND MUSTACHE
OFF THE MUG SHOT.

34:06.270 --> 34:08.773
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
AND DWAYNE,

34:08.810 --> 34:15.170
I GIVE YOU
MR. LEROY JENKINS!

34:15.220 --> 34:17.780
- HOLY CRAP.

34:17.820 --> 34:18.946
THIS GUY'S RESPONSIBLE

34:18.990 --> 34:21.379
FOR OVER 37 ARMED ROBBERIES
THROUGHOUT THE SOUTHWEST.

34:21.420 --> 34:22.853
HE KILLED
SEVERAL SECURITY GUARDS.

34:22.890 --> 34:25.120
NOBODY'S GOTTEN A PICTURE OF
THIS GUY IN THE LAST 25 YEARS.

34:25.160 --> 34:26.525
HE'S REMAINED
ABSOLUTELY INVISIBLE.

34:26.560 --> 34:28.391
- JENKINS WASN'T WORRIED
ABOUT THE REPERCUSSIONS

34:28.430 --> 34:29.658
OF SLEEPING
WITH A MARRIED WOMAN,

34:29.700 --> 34:30.655
BUT SOME LOW-GRADE PRIVATE EYE

34:30.700 --> 34:32.395
THAT MIGHT HAVE PICTURES OF HIM
ON HIS PHONE--

34:32.430 --> 34:34.136
NOW, THAT COULD EXPOSE
HIS WHEREABOUTS.

34:34.170 --> 34:35.660
- WAIT A MINUTE.
EVERYONE JUST WAIT A MINUTE.

34:35.700 --> 34:37.531
YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT ONE OF THE MOST WANTED GUYS

34:37.570 --> 34:39.800
IN THE STATE IS GONNA WALK
RIGHT INTO A BAR FULL OF COPS

34:39.840 --> 34:41.671
AND TRY TO GET A CELL PHONE.

34:41.710 --> 34:43.234
I'M SENSING
HE HAD A PARTNER.

34:43.280 --> 34:45.805
PULL UP
HIS "MOST WANTED" PAGE.

34:45.850 --> 34:47.806
ALL RIGHT, STATS, ALIASES--
NOTHING.

34:47.850 --> 34:49.408
WAIT.
NEXT OF KIN--

34:49.450 --> 34:50.519
BLOW THAT UP.

34:50.550 --> 34:52.313
- HIS ONLY KNOWN RELATIVE--

34:52.350 --> 34:54.113
AN ADOPTED DAUGHTER,
LILLY JENKINS.

34:54.160 --> 34:55.809
- [muffled shout]
THAT'S THE GIRL.

34:55.860 --> 34:57.555
THAT'S THE GIRL
FROM THE BAR LAST NIGHT

34:57.590 --> 34:59.683
THAT GUS
SUPPOSEDLY HOOKED UP WITH,

34:59.730 --> 35:01.823
ONLY YOUNGER AND CUTER
AND LESS MURDERER-Y.

35:01.860 --> 35:03.293
OH, MAN, THAT MEANS
"LAST NIGHT GUS"

35:03.330 --> 35:04.763
DID NOT HAVE THE GAME
HE THOUGHT HE DID.

35:04.800 --> 35:07.223
- WHERE'S GUSTER NOW?

35:07.270 --> 35:08.567
- WELL...

35:08.600 --> 35:10.158
HERE'S THE CRIB.

35:10.200 --> 35:13.306
NOTHING TOO FANCY,
YOU KNOW, JUST THE BASICS--

35:13.340 --> 35:16.503
COUCH,
BRAND-NEW 46-INCH PLASMA,

35:16.540 --> 35:18.246
ME.

35:21.880 --> 35:22.972
- SO HE SENT HIS DAUGHTER
INTO THE BAR

35:23.020 --> 35:24.112
TO GET THE PHONE AND THE
PICTURES FROM THE PRIVATE EYE.

35:24.150 --> 35:26.141
- SHE WASN'T PLANNING
ON BEFRIENDING A BUNCH OF COPS,

35:26.190 --> 35:27.316
SO SHE DRUGGED US
TO GET TO THE P.I. ALONE.

35:27.350 --> 35:28.556
GOT HIM ALONE.
HE HAD GUS' PHONE.

35:28.590 --> 35:30.182
- AND THEN SHE THOUGHT THAT GUS
HAD THE PRIVATE EYE'S PHONE

35:30.220 --> 35:31.687
THAT HAD
ALL THE PICTURES ON IT.

35:31.730 --> 35:33.322
- THAT'S WHY SHE'S BEEN TRYING
TO HOOK UP WITH HIM ALL DAY.

35:33.360 --> 35:34.657
- WAIT A MINUTE.
WHO'S CAR ARE WE TAKING?

35:37.760 --> 35:39.625
- HMM.
[Gus chuckles]

35:39.670 --> 35:41.558
- MM.
- MM.

35:41.600 --> 35:45.468
- MM.

35:45.510 --> 35:48.673
MM, MM, MM.

35:48.710 --> 35:51.178
- MM-HMM-HMM.
- [chuckles]

35:51.210 --> 35:54.873
TO THE BEGINNING
OF SOMETHING...

35:54.920 --> 35:56.569
WE SHOULD'VE DONE LAST NIGHT.

35:56.620 --> 35:58.349
- THERE IT IS.
- HMM.

35:58.390 --> 36:00.346
[glasses clink]

36:03.760 --> 36:05.648
[siren wailing]
- I CAN'T BELIEVE GUS

36:05.690 --> 36:07.487
WAS SO CARELESS TO FALL
FOR SOME GIRL'S HUSTLE.

36:07.530 --> 36:08.758
- LOOK, JULES,
I DON'T THINK ANYONE

36:08.800 --> 36:10.893
SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR
ANYTHING THEY SAID LAST NIGHT,

36:10.930 --> 36:13.569
WHETHER IT WAS MURDERING PEOPLE
OR JUST SPEAKING OUT OF TURN.

36:13.600 --> 36:15.238
- SO YOU'RE TELLING ME
YOU'RE CONVINCED

36:16.840 --> 36:18.637
- NO, I CAN SEE
THE CONFRONTATION WITH THE P.I.

36:18.670 --> 36:19.762
IT DIDN'T GO WELL.

36:19.810 --> 36:23.507
LILLY HAD TO CALL IN HER FATHER
TO DO HER DIRTY WORK.

36:23.540 --> 36:25.906
THE HUSBAND, SCOTT WILLIAMS,
HE KNEW ABOUT THE PHOTOS,

36:25.950 --> 36:27.474
SO HE HAD TO GO, TOO.

36:27.510 --> 36:28.943
[engine rewing,
tires squealing]

36:30.650 --> 36:33.380
- [chuckles]
YOU--

36:33.420 --> 36:35.388
YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKE
ABOUT YOU?

36:35.420 --> 36:37.684
- HMM?
- YOU HAVE EYES.

36:37.720 --> 36:39.381
- YES, I DO.

36:39.430 --> 36:41.751
- TWO OF THEM.
- TWO OF THEM, YES.

36:41.800 --> 36:45.668
[both chuckling]

36:45.700 --> 36:47.918
- MM.

36:47.970 --> 36:50.188
- MM.

36:51.640 --> 36:53.835
WILL YOU EXCUSE ME
TO FRESHEN UP?

36:53.870 --> 36:56.236
- SURE.

36:56.280 --> 36:57.804
- HMM.

36:57.840 --> 36:59.842
- MM.

37:13.290 --> 37:15.520
- HELLO, FRIEND.

37:15.560 --> 37:17.755
- HELLO.

37:17.800 --> 37:20.894
- YOU'RE A TOUGH LITTLE FELLA
TO TRACK DOWN.

37:20.930 --> 37:22.761
- WIPING.

37:22.800 --> 37:24.700
WIPING.
- WITHOUT YOUR FRIENDS,

37:24.740 --> 37:26.731
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GONNA BE
GIVING ME ANY TROUBLE NOW,

37:26.770 --> 37:28.670
ARE YOU?
- [chuckling]

37:28.710 --> 37:31.008
- I HAVE JUST ONE QUESTION
FOR YOU.

37:31.040 --> 37:34.009
- WHAT'S THAT?
- WHERE'S THE PHONE?

37:34.050 --> 37:36.541
- WHERE'S THE PHONE?
- WHERE IS THE PHONE?

37:36.580 --> 37:38.787
- WHERE IS THE PHONE?
- WHERE'S THE PHONE?

37:38.820 --> 37:41.857
- [snickering]

37:41.890 --> 37:44.620
[laughing]

37:44.660 --> 37:47.527
[siren wails, tires screech]

37:47.560 --> 37:49.949
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
DO YOU NOT SEE THE LIGHTS?

37:50.000 --> 37:54.699
- HEY, BOSS, ISN'T THAT
YOUR FORD FUSION?

37:58.710 --> 38:00.769
- YOU'RE THE BARTENDER.
YOU SON OF A BITCH.

38:00.810 --> 38:02.368
- MCNAB, GO, GO, GO.

38:02.410 --> 38:04.605
CARLTON!
- I WILL KILL YOU!

38:04.650 --> 38:06.049
I KNOW YOUR FACE!

38:06.080 --> 38:08.571
- STOP REPEATING
EVERYTHING I'M SAYING.

38:08.620 --> 38:10.576
EVERYTHING I'M SAYING.
- STOP REPEATING

38:10.620 --> 38:11.917
- YOU'RE NOT GETTING IT,
ARE YOU?

38:11.950 --> 38:13.542
I HAVE A GUN
POINTED AT YOUR HEAD,

38:13.590 --> 38:15.979
AND I WILL SHOOT YOU
UNLESS YOU GIVE ME THAT PHONE.

38:16.020 --> 38:18.454
- CAN I SQUISH YOUR FACE?

38:18.490 --> 38:20.458
- HE WILL SHOOT YOU.
- HE'S GONNA SHOOT YOU?

38:20.490 --> 38:21.593
- NO, YOU.

38:21.630 --> 38:25.361
- WOW. YOU WERE IN THE BATHROOM
FOR A REALLY LONG TIME.

38:25.400 --> 38:26.628
[door thuds open]

38:26.670 --> 38:29.332
- DROP THE GUN, JENKINS!

38:29.370 --> 38:30.394
- EASY.

38:30.440 --> 38:32.965
EASY.

38:42.680 --> 38:45.012
- [laughing]

38:45.050 --> 38:47.689
- DON'T SHOOT GUS!
- THEN TELL HIM TO TAKE COVER!

38:47.720 --> 38:49.779
- GUS, TAKE COVER, BUDDY!

38:49.820 --> 38:52.425
[bullets ricocheting

38:52.460 --> 38:55.429
- [continues laughing]

38:55.460 --> 38:57.018
OH, MY GOD.

38:57.060 --> 38:59.369
SOMEBODY SHOT THAT GUY'S TV.

38:59.400 --> 39:01.061
- THAT'S YOUR TV!

39:01.100 --> 39:04.399
- WHAT?
THIS DUDE HAS TAFFY!

39:04.440 --> 39:05.532
I LOVE TAFFY!

39:05.570 --> 39:07.936
- GUS, THIS GUY
IS TRYING TO KILL US.

39:07.970 --> 39:09.574
HE IS BAD!

39:09.610 --> 39:11.874
WE ARE GOOD!

39:23.120 --> 39:25.020
GOOD JOB, BUDDY.

39:25.060 --> 39:28.154
- UH...
THIS DUDE HAS A GUN.

39:28.190 --> 39:31.489
- YES, HE DOES--A BIG ONE.

39:36.640 --> 39:40.565
- LOOK, DON'T DROWN THEM.
JUST POWDER THEM, OKAY?

39:40.610 --> 39:42.703
GOOD.
- DONALD...

39:42.740 --> 39:45.106
DO YOU LIKE TO SAMBA?

39:45.150 --> 39:47.573
- WHAT THE HELL'S WRONG
WITH THIS GUY?

39:47.610 --> 39:51.046
- DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT LICKING THAT.

39:51.080 --> 39:54.049
- IT'S NOT REALLY
GENDER-SPECIFIC, IS IT?

39:54.090 --> 39:55.853
- NO.

39:55.890 --> 39:56.788
YOU KNOW...

39:56.820 --> 40:01.723
AS MUCH AS THIS
PAINS ME DEEPLY TO SAY...

40:01.760 --> 40:03.921
THANK YOU.
- FOR WHAT?

40:03.960 --> 40:06.599
- WELL, FOR HELPING US GET
THROUGH THIS WHOLE ORDEAL

40:06.630 --> 40:09.190
AND ALSO FOR BELIEVING
THAT I DIDN'T KILL SOMEONE.

40:09.240 --> 40:11.196
- GUS WAS PRETTY SURE
YOU DID KILL SOMEONE.

40:11.240 --> 40:12.969
- I STILL AM.

40:13.010 --> 40:15.478
- DON'T WORRY, LASSIE.

40:15.510 --> 40:17.933
YOU'LL KILL SOMEONE SOMEDAY.

40:17.980 --> 40:19.743
NOW, COME ON,
LET'S SPOON IT OUT.

40:19.780 --> 40:22.715
COME ON, WE'LL MAKE IT RIGHT,
HALF MOON STYLE.

40:25.190 --> 40:27.818
[sighing] OH, THIS IS NOT GONNA
BE EASY WITH JULES.

40:27.850 --> 40:31.479
ANY CHANCE YOU CAN, UH, CHANNEL
"LAST NIGHT GUS,"

40:31.530 --> 40:33.157
TELL ME HOW TO HANDLE THIS?
- PLEASE.

40:33.190 --> 40:35.727
IT TURNS OUT "LAST NIGHT GUS"
IS VERY SIMILAR TO "TODAY GUS."

40:35.760 --> 40:38.490
- I'M NOT READY.
- I UNDERSTAND.

40:38.530 --> 40:39.622
YOU JUST HAVE TO BE MAN ENOUGH

40:39.670 --> 40:41.023
TO TELL HER YOU WANT
TO LIVE ALONE.

40:41.070 --> 40:42.094
IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

40:42.140 --> 40:44.904
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
- I KNOW.

40:44.940 --> 40:46.760
- YOU TELL HER.
- COME ON, SON.

40:46.810 --> 40:49.904
GET OUT OF HERE WITH THAT BULL.
- ALL RIGHT.

40:49.940 --> 40:51.874
ALL RIGHT.

40:53.210 --> 40:54.575
- 100 BUCKS.
- SHAWN.

40:54.620 --> 40:55.609
- RIGHT.

40:57.080 --> 40:58.513
[sighs]
HEY.

40:58.550 --> 40:59.642
- HI.

40:59.690 --> 41:02.511
- OKAY, SO, LISTEN, I-I'VE BEEN
DOING A LOT OF THINKING

41:02.560 --> 41:04.858
ABOUT OUR CONVERSATION.
- ME TOO.

41:04.890 --> 41:07.779
- YOU HAVE?
- OF COURSE.

41:07.830 --> 41:10.799
LOOK, I DON'T WANT
THE FUTURE US

41:10.830 --> 41:13.993
TO BE DICTATED BY SOMETHING
THAT "LAST NIGHT SHAWN" SAID.

41:14.030 --> 41:15.258
SO, IF YOU CAN LOOK ME
IN THE EYE

41:15.300 --> 41:19.202
AND TELL ME THAT "TODAY SHAWN"
DEFINITELY WANTS TO MOVE IN...

41:21.010 --> 41:22.830
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
- NO, NO, NO.

41:22.880 --> 41:24.939
I WAS--I WAS ABOUT TO SAY YES.
- NO, YOU WEREN'T.

41:24.980 --> 41:27.073
- I WAS. I WAS JUST--
I WAS GONNA USE AN ACCENT,

41:27.110 --> 41:28.543
AND I WAS WAFFLING BETWEEN...

41:28.580 --> 41:29.672
[Scottish accent]
SCOTTISH...

41:29.720 --> 41:30.778
[Gaelic accent]
AND GAELIC.

41:30.820 --> 41:31.639
- [chuckles]

41:31.690 --> 41:33.681
- AND THE DIFFERENCES
ARE VERY SUBTLE.

41:33.720 --> 41:34.880
- IT'S FINE.

41:34.920 --> 41:39.550
THE FACT THAT ANY VERSION
OF SHAWN WANTED TO MOVE IN IS...

41:39.590 --> 41:41.820
- MINTY?

41:41.860 --> 41:43.225
- I WAS GONNA SAY "ROMANTIC."

41:43.260 --> 41:45.694
- REALLY?

41:45.730 --> 41:47.721
SO YOU'RE NOT
TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED IN ME.

41:47.770 --> 41:50.238
- LOOK, I'M JUST SAYING
THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO HAPPEN

41:50.270 --> 41:52.568
RIGHT NOW, TODAY.

41:52.610 --> 41:54.009
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?

41:54.040 --> 41:56.838
- I UNDERSTAND.
- OKAY.

41:56.880 --> 41:59.849
- YOU'RE AN INgFRIEDIBLE SLOB.

41:59.880 --> 42:02.110
- A HOARDER, RIGHT?

42:02.150 --> 42:03.572
I BET YOU--THAT YOU JUST LIVE

42:03.620 --> 42:06.111
AMIDST STACKS AND STACKS
OF PERIODICALS

42:06.150 --> 42:08.710
AND--AND TAXIDERMY.

42:08.760 --> 42:10.250
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL ME?

42:10.290 --> 42:11.985
- YOU WERE READY
TO MOVE IN WITH ME.

42:12.030 --> 42:14.590
- OH, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

42:14.630 --> 42:16.257
MAYBE "LAST NIGHT SHAWN"
HAS MORE IN COMMON

42:16.300 --> 42:18.860
WITH "TODAY SHAWN"
THAN "TODAY SHAWN" THINKS.

42:18.900 --> 42:20.993
- WHAT?
- DON'T--DON'T JUDGE ME.

42:21.030 --> 42:22.588
- [laughing]
I'M NOT JUDGING.

42:22.640 --> 42:24.096
- YOU HAVE A STUFFED MEERKAT
IN YOUR HOME.

42:24.140 --> 42:25.164
- WHAT?

42:25.210 --> 42:26.404
- AND YOU DON'T USE
TOILET PAPER.

42:26.440 --> 42:28.101
- [laughing] OH, OKAY, WELL,
YOU CAN GIVE ME SOME OF YOURS.

42:28.140 --> 42:29.129
THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE.
