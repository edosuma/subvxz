WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:03.435
(THEME SONG PLAYING)

00:10.343 --> 00:11.676
Oh!

00:11.711 --> 00:13.879
Look at this darling crudite
plate you've put together.

00:13.914 --> 00:15.881
Don't mind if I do. (SQUEALS)

00:15.916 --> 00:17.416
Well, I mind if you do.

00:17.451 --> 00:18.917
We're bringing this to
the neighbor's house tonight.

00:18.952 --> 00:20.585
-What neighbors?
-The ones down on the corner.

00:20.620 --> 00:22.287
They invited us
to dinner tonight.

00:22.322 --> 00:23.755
Who invited us
to dinner tonight?

00:23.790 --> 00:25.057
Apparently, our neighbors.

00:25.092 --> 00:26.925
And what corner
are you talking about?

00:26.960 --> 00:28.994
The one towards the freeway,
the ones with the
big driveway.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.595
The Goodmans. John Goodman.

00:30.630 --> 00:33.165
-John Goodman, the actor?
-Huh?

00:33.200 --> 00:35.400
Our neighbor is
John Goodman,
the actor?

00:35.435 --> 00:37.135
I don't know what he does
for a living.

00:37.170 --> 00:38.470
He's the guy from <i> Roseanne.</i>

00:38.505 --> 00:40.839
He's in all those
Coen Brother movies.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.174
<i>Argo.</i>

00:42.209 --> 00:43.308
<i>Argo</i> wasn't
a Coen Brothers movie.

00:43.343 --> 00:45.277
You better bet your butt
it was.

00:45.312 --> 00:47.446
Takes place in Fargo,
North Dakota.

00:47.481 --> 00:49.748
The Coen Brother wife
won an Academy Award.

00:49.783 --> 00:52.384
You better look it up, man.
It's called <i> Fargo.</i>

00:52.419 --> 00:53.752
Right, but you said <i> "Argo.'</i>

00:53.787 --> 00:56.755
Right. And John Goodman
is in it. Look it up.

00:56.790 --> 00:59.758
Well, this is exciting.
And it's tonight?

00:59.793 --> 01:00.892
PIGEON: What's tonight?

01:00.927 --> 01:02.361
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

01:04.731 --> 01:07.032
-What was that?
-Oh, the applause?

01:07.067 --> 01:08.233
I had that installed.

01:08.268 --> 01:09.568
The alarm guy was here

01:09.603 --> 01:11.470
and I gave him a couple
of bills to put this in.

01:11.505 --> 01:13.472
There's a speaker
under the sink.

01:15.375 --> 01:17.576
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

01:17.611 --> 01:20.011
But, seriously,
what's tonight?

01:20.046 --> 01:21.980
We have all been invited
to have dinner

01:22.015 --> 01:25.250
in the home of none other
than the great character
actor, John Goodman.

01:25.285 --> 01:26.952
Dinner at John Goodman's, huh?

01:26.987 --> 01:29.788
I guess we shouldn't count on
any leftovers.

01:29.823 --> 01:31.123
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

01:32.259 --> 01:33.758
Where are these sensors?

01:33.793 --> 01:37.162
Oh, hey. Whose idea was it
to bring these vegetables?

01:37.197 --> 01:39.397
Not John Goodman,
that's for sure.

01:39.432 --> 01:41.199
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

01:41.234 --> 01:43.068
Okay, can you turn that off?

01:43.103 --> 01:44.302
I have a better idea.

01:44.337 --> 01:47.472
Why don't I turn you on?

01:47.507 --> 01:49.241
(AUDIENCE CHEERING
AND APPLAUDING)

01:56.016 --> 01:57.516
Ugh!

01:57.551 --> 01:59.985
One day, I swear to God,
I'm gonna
break his little neck

02:00.020 --> 02:01.353
and bury him in the backyard.

02:01.388 --> 02:02.721
(AUDIENCE BOOING)

02:04.324 --> 02:06.958
PIGEON: The audience
does not like you, Yung.

02:06.993 --> 02:08.860
(DOORBELL RINGING)

02:08.895 --> 02:11.963
Michael, you didn't wanna
wear something different?

02:11.998 --> 02:13.265
Oh, damn.

02:16.002 --> 02:18.069
Well, now what are you
gonna do with that?

02:18.104 --> 02:19.671
Well, I'll just leave it here.

02:19.706 --> 02:22.741
I bet I never have to wear
that ugly-ass tracksuit again.

02:22.776 --> 02:24.576
Ooh, nice bush.

02:24.611 --> 02:25.611
Ugh!

02:26.713 --> 02:28.146
Oh, hi. Welcome.

02:28.181 --> 02:30.115
What...
You're not John Goodman.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.684
-Gil Zakaryan.
-Yeah. Gil Zakaryan.

02:32.719 --> 02:34.085
Not John Goodman.

02:34.120 --> 02:38.290
Hey, Gil. I hope you and Helen
like the crudite platter.

02:38.325 --> 02:41.359
I'm so glad
we're finally doing this.

02:41.394 --> 02:43.028
Oh! What is that?

02:43.063 --> 02:45.130
Oh, yeah. I didn't know what
to put in that middle part

02:45.165 --> 02:46.498
so I just did butter.

02:46.533 --> 02:48.533
Who doesn't like butter,
right?

02:48.568 --> 02:51.069
So, Gil, what is it
that you do for a living?

02:51.104 --> 02:53.905
I was telling these guys
you're in <i> The Big Lebowski.</i>

02:53.940 --> 02:55.407
Oh, I'm a radiologist,

02:55.442 --> 02:57.475
although Helen keeps
asking me to retire.

02:57.510 --> 02:59.211
She wants to travel more.

02:59.246 --> 03:00.445
(CHUCKLES)

03:01.715 --> 03:04.849
Well, I could see both sides.

03:04.884 --> 03:07.919
Oh, Gil, did we already say
what you did for a living?

03:07.954 --> 03:10.388
Yes. Radiology.

03:10.423 --> 03:13.692
That's right.
Then we talked about Helen
wanting to travel more.

03:14.761 --> 03:15.860
Oh, my lord.

03:15.895 --> 03:17.896
-Can I have another drink?
-(TIMER DINGS)

03:17.931 --> 03:19.297
What the f--- is that?

03:19.332 --> 03:20.532
Oh, that's just telling me

03:20.567 --> 03:22.601
to take the salmon
out of the oven.

03:22.636 --> 03:24.703
Oh, good. We're having salmon.

03:30.944 --> 03:33.712
Does anybody else's salmon
tastes weird, like,

03:33.747 --> 03:35.480
it's fishy, like it's rotten?

03:35.515 --> 03:37.449
(STAMMERS) It's delicious.

03:37.484 --> 03:39.618
Yours tastes just like mine,
Marquess.

03:39.653 --> 03:42.354
I'm so sorry. I could get you
something else.

03:42.389 --> 03:45.323
No, I don't want you
to have to go
through a lot of trouble.

03:45.358 --> 03:46.658
What kind of cereal
do you got?

03:46.693 --> 03:49.494
Um, we have
a bran type with raisins.

03:49.529 --> 03:52.597
I think we have granola
and maybe some muesli.

03:52.632 --> 03:54.866
I'll take the muesli.

03:54.901 --> 03:57.068
So, Mike, what are you doing
these days?

03:57.103 --> 03:58.470
Oh, not much.

03:58.505 --> 04:00.972
Watch reality television,
hang out.

04:01.007 --> 04:04.709
I eat, I sleep,
I drive around sometimes,

04:04.744 --> 04:07.145
I go for walks, go for runs,

04:07.180 --> 04:08.480
fishing, hiking,

04:08.515 --> 04:11.583
long walks on the beach
just holding hands,

04:11.618 --> 04:14.085
maybe a quiet dinner sometime.

04:14.120 --> 04:15.720
No strings attached.

04:15.755 --> 04:18.657
In the end, it's not the years
you put in life that count,

04:18.692 --> 04:22.527
it's the life you put
in the years that count.

04:22.562 --> 04:26.765
Um, Michael has a mystery team
that we are all part of.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.234
Mysteries? Oh,
that's got to be interesting.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.702
Nope.

04:30.737 --> 04:33.538
You know, we've got
a little mystery ourselves.

04:33.573 --> 04:36.441
This was our son's bedroom,
but when he went away
to college,

04:36.476 --> 04:38.910
we decided to convert it
into a home office.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.478
I mean, I've always
wanted to write a book

04:40.513 --> 04:43.114
about my experiences
as a radiologist.

04:43.149 --> 04:45.250
Oh, can I pre-order that?

04:45.285 --> 04:46.451
(LAUGHS)

04:46.486 --> 04:47.886
We just got
the carpeting done.

04:47.921 --> 04:50.789
Cost a fortune.
That and those blinds.

04:50.824 --> 04:52.657
But, Helen was in charge
of all that

04:52.692 --> 04:54.426
and I'm not supposed
to ask any questions,

04:54.461 --> 04:56.828
just write the checks.
(LAUGHS)

04:56.863 --> 04:58.596
(GROANS) Is the mystery
why Helen thinks

04:58.631 --> 05:00.899
louvered blinds
are still a thing?

05:02.302 --> 05:04.436
Oh, no. Oh, damn,
I missed my mouth.

05:04.471 --> 05:06.271
Who has a paper towel? Anyone?

05:06.306 --> 05:07.505
I'll get it.

05:07.540 --> 05:09.407
So, long story short...

05:09.442 --> 05:11.476
What is the point
of saying that?

05:11.511 --> 05:13.611
No one ever says anything
short enough.

05:13.646 --> 05:15.880
And saying that takes up
even more time.

05:15.915 --> 05:18.883
Christ, why am I talking? Now
I'm wasting all of our time,

05:18.918 --> 05:20.251
and I'm sorry for that,

05:20.286 --> 05:22.220
but at least I don't preface
taking up all of our time

05:22.255 --> 05:24.556
by saying, "I'm not gonna
take up all of our time."

05:24.591 --> 05:26.291
And yes, I'd f--- Helen.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.959
But first, pants her,

05:27.994 --> 05:31.296
and spank that shitty cook
for that meal. (CHUCKLES)

05:31.331 --> 05:33.131
That salmon, awful!

05:33.166 --> 05:35.066
I mean, just awful.

05:35.101 --> 05:36.601
I'm sorry for you, Gil.

05:36.636 --> 05:39.637
Spent all day radiologing,
whatever the f--- that is,

05:39.672 --> 05:42.474
and then you come home
to a meal like that? Awful!

05:47.514 --> 05:48.580
That's better.

05:48.615 --> 05:50.115
So, as I was saying,

05:50.150 --> 05:52.450
this was going to be
this home office,

05:52.485 --> 05:54.352
and we can't get
the Internet in here.

05:54.387 --> 05:55.754
And I've called
the cable company,

05:55.789 --> 05:57.322
and they gave me a booster,

05:57.357 --> 05:59.290
and then
they reset the router,

05:59.325 --> 06:00.692
and they say
the signal is strong,

06:00.727 --> 06:02.961
so, it's a mystery.

06:02.996 --> 06:04.195
No Internet.

06:04.230 --> 06:06.531
That's our mystery!

06:06.566 --> 06:08.466
The real mystery is
where your wife went

06:08.501 --> 06:09.768
for that paper towel.

06:09.803 --> 06:11.302
Did she go
to the corner store?

06:11.337 --> 06:13.638
I mean, if I knew she was
going to the corner store,

06:13.673 --> 06:15.673
I would've had her pick me up
some rubbers

06:15.708 --> 06:17.108
and a pack of smokes.

06:17.143 --> 06:18.576
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

06:18.611 --> 06:21.012
What? How is that
happening here?

06:21.047 --> 06:24.249
Don't get hung up
on the logic, just enjoy it.

06:24.284 --> 06:25.750
It's fun. We're having fun.

06:25.785 --> 06:27.886
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

06:27.921 --> 06:30.021
Here's the thing,
John Goodman.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.190
I wanna help you
with your mystery, right?

06:32.225 --> 06:33.525
I really do.

06:33.560 --> 06:36.561
But I don't like mixing
business and friendship.

06:36.596 --> 06:37.896
You and your wife, Gil,

06:37.931 --> 06:40.365
you guys mean the world to me,
you know?

06:40.400 --> 06:41.866
I'm not saying no.

06:41.901 --> 06:44.736
I'm just saying
let me think about it, okay?

06:49.309 --> 06:51.176
Damn, motherf----- damn!

06:51.211 --> 06:53.645
My crudite platter.

06:53.680 --> 06:56.748
-Let's go, let's go!
-Dad, slow down!

06:56.783 --> 06:59.517
Why do you need
your crudite platter so bad?

06:59.552 --> 07:02.387
Yung, that was a gift
from your mother.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.788
-My mother?
-What?

07:03.823 --> 07:05.857
She left two things
at my doorstep.

07:05.892 --> 07:08.159
You and that crudite platter,

07:08.194 --> 07:11.196
and she said,
"Take equal care of both."

07:11.231 --> 07:13.198
You've never said any of this.

07:13.233 --> 07:14.599
What else did she say?

07:14.634 --> 07:16.601
I don't know.
After that, it was all a blur.

07:16.636 --> 07:17.802
But I made her a promise,

07:17.837 --> 07:19.404
and I'm gonna
honor that promise

07:19.439 --> 07:20.738
for the rest of my life.

07:20.773 --> 07:23.641
Michael, can't we just
get it tomorrow?

07:23.676 --> 07:25.143
No. If we go over there
in the light of day,

07:25.178 --> 07:27.345
they'll want us to solve
their Internet mystery,

07:27.380 --> 07:29.080
and I don't know
s--- about electronics.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.748
And then that guy
will be disappointed,

07:30.783 --> 07:32.417
and I'll lose my only friend
in the whole world.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.419
Uh, "only friend"?
What about us?

07:34.454 --> 07:36.120
That's a one-way friendship.

07:36.155 --> 07:37.188
You guys like me,

07:37.223 --> 07:39.390
but with the other guy,
we like each other.

07:39.425 --> 07:41.025
He's a radiologist.

07:41.060 --> 07:42.694
I esteem him.

07:45.265 --> 07:46.564
All right, get down in there.

07:46.599 --> 07:48.066
What? What for?

07:48.101 --> 07:50.268
We'll get under their house,
tunnel up,

07:50.303 --> 07:53.004
and get the platter,
and nobody'll be the wiser.

07:53.039 --> 07:54.839
We can't just climb
into a window, Marquess.

07:54.874 --> 07:57.008
Somebody will see us.
And I'm a celebrity,

07:57.043 --> 08:00.078
and that shit will be all over
<i>TMZ,</i> man.

08:00.113 --> 08:01.446
And guess what then?

08:01.481 --> 08:03.181
No more <i> Mike Tyson Mysteries.</i>

08:03.216 --> 08:04.616
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

08:05.385 --> 08:06.885
What, that's not funny?

08:06.920 --> 08:09.787
I thought... I thought
that was supposed to be funny.

08:09.822 --> 08:11.322
Here you go, little buddy.

08:11.357 --> 08:12.857
Oh, thank you for placing me

08:12.892 --> 08:14.959
directly into this
fecal matter.

08:14.994 --> 08:16.694
Hmm, now, what pipe would lead

08:16.729 --> 08:18.696
directly into
their living room?

08:18.731 --> 08:20.965
Yeah, you'd think
they'd be marked.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.200
Ooh, here we go.

08:23.703 --> 08:26.738
What? What on Earth is this?

08:31.611 --> 08:34.112
(SOFTLY) Wait here.
I'll go get the platter.

08:36.282 --> 08:39.117
Why do they have a staircase
to the sewer?

08:41.087 --> 08:43.021
(SOFTLY) She didn't
even wash it.

08:48.261 --> 08:49.794
Do you guys hear that?

08:53.366 --> 08:56.868
This doesn't look
like 75 kilos.
Explain yourself!

08:56.903 --> 08:58.136
Is it safe to talk here?

08:58.171 --> 08:59.804
The Feds,
they can listen anywhere.

08:59.839 --> 09:01.973
It's safe. I had
signal scrambles installed.

09:02.008 --> 09:04.609
I know it's working because
we have no Internet
in the room above us.

09:04.644 --> 09:06.411
My f------ husband
keeps bitching about it.

09:06.446 --> 09:07.779
Okay. Okay.

09:07.814 --> 09:10.348
We're having supply problems
in Acuna.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.584
Everything is going
through Laredo,
and it's a nightmare.

09:12.619 --> 09:15.520
Hey, excuses
are like assholes,
everyone's got one.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.288
MIKE:
Oh, damn, she's a drug dealer.

09:17.323 --> 09:18.489
Hey, <i> policia!</i>

09:18.524 --> 09:19.758
You son of a...

09:20.660 --> 09:21.860
(YELLING)

09:25.665 --> 09:27.999
The gun battle went on
for 20 minutes.

09:28.034 --> 09:31.769
Helen, who I knew as a wife,
a mother, a great cook,

09:31.804 --> 09:33.671
a talented home decorator,

09:33.706 --> 09:37.008
but who the Zetas cartel
knew as La Diabla,

09:37.043 --> 09:38.309
was killed.

09:38.344 --> 09:40.478
Shot 14 times.

09:40.513 --> 09:43.881
As a radiologist, I use
imaging techniques to see

09:43.916 --> 09:45.883
even the smallest
evidence of disease,

09:45.918 --> 09:47.652
yet as a husband I was blind

09:47.687 --> 09:49.821
to something
even more insidious.

09:49.856 --> 09:51.756
To make a long story short...

09:51.791 --> 09:53.024
Oh, my God.

09:53.059 --> 09:55.026
My wife was using our home

09:55.061 --> 09:57.128
as the cocaine
distribution hub

09:57.163 --> 10:00.298
for the entire
Western United States.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.200
The end.

10:03.836 --> 10:06.838
He said, "The end."

10:06.873 --> 10:08.607
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

10:11.744 --> 10:13.945
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

10:21.054 --> 10:22.520
MARQUESS: <i> What... Michael,</i>

10:22.555 --> 10:24.856
<i>you don't wanna wear</i>
<i>something different again?</i>

10:24.891 --> 10:27.258
<i>Oh. Oh, my God.</i>

10:27.293 --> 10:28.793
<i>Why don't you</i>
<i>just wear the tux</i>

10:28.828 --> 10:30.428
<i>so you don't need</i>
<i>the tracksuit?</i>

10:30.463 --> 10:32.930
<i>Is this because you're</i>
<i>trying to be James Bond?</i>

10:32.965 --> 10:34.899
<i>You are, aren't you? Okay.</i>

10:34.934 --> 10:36.134
<i>Take the shoes off.</i>

10:36.169 --> 10:37.735
<i>Michael? Okay, there you go.</i>

10:37.770 --> 10:39.070
<i>You should do that first</i>

10:39.105 --> 10:40.471
<i>and then this would be</i>
<i>a lot easier.</i>

10:40.506 --> 10:42.073
<i>Do you need some help?</i>

10:42.108 --> 10:43.541
<i>Hmm? Okay.</i>

10:43.576 --> 10:45.209
<i>Fix your sleeve.</i>

10:45.244 --> 10:47.745
<i>On your jacket.</i>
<i>Can you fix it?</i>

10:47.780 --> 10:49.681
<i>There you go... No.</i>
<i>You didn't do it.</i>

10:50.116 --> 10:51.282
<i>Michael?</i>

10:51.317 --> 10:55.119
<i>So no shoes? Just a tux</i>
<i>with white socks.</i>

10:55.154 --> 10:57.088
<i>All right. It is what it is.</i>
