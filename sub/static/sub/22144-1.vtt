02:42.295 --> 02:44.629
- Oh, don't wake up.

02:44.997 --> 02:46.698
I'm running 20 k.

02:46.700 --> 02:49.134
I'll be back to take
Gemma to school.

05:16.782 --> 05:18.116
<i>- It'll take a while
for her to come out</i>

05:18.118 --> 05:19.851
<i>of the induced coma.</i>

05:19.853 --> 05:22.320
<i>She has been in it
for almost two weeks.</i>

05:23.222 --> 05:26.291
<i>As for the head injury
and brain swelling...</i>

05:26.293 --> 05:28.260
<i>She may have memory loss.</i>

05:28.262 --> 05:31.429
<i>- I'm hoping to wean her
off the ventilator soon.</i>

05:31.431 --> 05:34.299
<i>The danger is,
if she stays on too long,</i>

05:34.301 --> 05:36.868
<i>her lungs will forget
how to breathe.</i>

05:36.870 --> 05:39.004
<i>Has she had any other
major health issues?</i>

05:39.006 --> 05:39.004
<i>- I've been through
all this already.</i>

05:39.006 --> 05:41.873
<i>She had meningitis
when she was four or five.</i>

05:41.875 --> 05:44.142
<i>Other than that, nothing.</i>

05:44.144 --> 05:46.444
<i>She's the healthiest
person I know.</i>

05:46.446 --> 05:48.914
<i>- Thank god.
Probably saved her life.</i>

05:49.782 --> 05:51.950
I think she's waking up.

05:53.185 --> 05:54.986
- Dana?

05:56.188 --> 05:58.089
Dana, can you hear me?

05:58.457 --> 06:00.425
It's me, honey.

06:05.173 --> 06:06.432
- <i>Attention, please.</i>

06:06.433 --> 06:10.468
<i>Visiting hours are over
in fifteen minutes.</i>

06:12.004 --> 06:13.772
- <i>G.</i>

06:14.240 --> 06:15.874
<i>E.</i>

06:17.276 --> 06:19.778
<i>G. G.</i>

06:22.082 --> 06:24.015
- Just try it again.

06:24.283 --> 06:27.118
You don't have to
type out full words.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.486
The program's
designed to predict

06:28.488 --> 06:30.789
what you're trying to say.

06:37.029 --> 06:38.463
- <i>G.</i>

06:38.798 --> 06:42.100
<i>E. Gemma.</i>

06:42.102 --> 06:45.136
- Gemma's good.

06:47.873 --> 06:51.209
You know she's been
in here every day.

06:51.211 --> 06:53.011
Reading to you.

06:53.846 --> 06:55.480
Singing to you.

06:57.249 --> 06:59.918
We wanna get you back home soon.

08:23.469 --> 08:24.536
Hello?

08:41.419 --> 08:43.288
- <i>Hello?</i>

08:48.194 --> 08:50.395
<i>Is anybody there?</i>

08:51.130 --> 08:53.565
<i>Is anybody there?</i>

09:29.030 --> 09:30.469
- <i>Visitors are reminded</i>

09:30.470 --> 09:33.304
<i>to please use the hand sanitizer</i>

09:33.306 --> 09:35.473
<i>when entering
or leaving the building.</i>

09:35.475 --> 09:37.008
<i>Thank you.</i>

09:37.010 --> 09:40.145
- <i>My tweets stay Intel...</i>

09:47.052 --> 09:50.255
- <i>My eighteenth day in hell.</i>

09:52.024 --> 09:56.060
<i>I feel trapped inside myself.</i>

09:56.062 --> 09:59.264
<i>My own body is a prison.</i>

10:04.537 --> 10:07.472
<i>I have to pee in a bag.</i>

10:07.474 --> 10:09.174
<i>Eat through a tube.</i>

10:10.276 --> 10:12.143
<i>Take me home.</i>

10:12.145 --> 10:13.611
<i>Please.</i>

10:14.180 --> 10:16.214
<i>I want to go home.</i>

10:21.253 --> 10:24.322
<i>Trevor, you can come in.</i>

10:25.057 --> 10:26.624
- Hey, hey, hey.

10:26.626 --> 10:29.527
You're getting pretty good on
your little speak 'n spell.

10:29.529 --> 10:31.396
You'll be doing
all that scratching

10:31.398 --> 10:34.098
and electro DJ stuff next.

10:40.706 --> 10:43.474
- Someone...

10:45.244 --> 10:47.745
Someone was...

10:52.685 --> 10:56.788
<i>- Someone in my room
last night watching me.</i>

10:56.790 --> 10:58.556
- Last night?

10:59.291 --> 11:03.294
<i>- I hear a strange noise
in my sleep.</i>

11:03.296 --> 11:05.430
- Well there's no-one
here now.

11:05.432 --> 11:07.298
D'you want me to check?

11:09.268 --> 11:11.302
No.
Nothing down here.

11:11.304 --> 11:13.471
Just piss and poo.

11:19.778 --> 11:22.547
What, you think there's
someone hiding in there?

11:30.189 --> 11:31.656
Hello?

11:31.658 --> 11:33.858
Anybody home?

11:46.772 --> 11:50.208
No. Just supplies.

11:51.577 --> 11:54.445
Look, I know this place
can give you the willies.

11:54.447 --> 11:55.847
I mean, I've heard things,

11:55.849 --> 11:58.383
especially at night
when someone kacks.

11:58.385 --> 11:59.684
- Kacks?

11:59.686 --> 12:03.154
- You know, expires.
Stops respirating.

12:03.589 --> 12:05.323
Dies.

12:21.473 --> 12:23.775
Time for Mr. Bodywash.

12:24.643 --> 12:27.312
- I don't need...

12:42.795 --> 12:44.729
- Hey.

12:44.731 --> 12:46.597
How you doing?

12:47.299 --> 12:48.566
- I'll be fine.

12:48.568 --> 12:51.336
- What does that mean,
"I'll be fine"?

12:53.372 --> 12:55.373
- I'll be fine.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.909
- You're gonna have to put
a brave face on for mom now.

12:57.911 --> 12:59.744
Okay?

13:08.354 --> 13:10.588
Okay, here we are.

13:11.357 --> 13:13.157
Look, I know it looks
a little rundown

13:13.159 --> 13:14.659
from the outside, but...

13:14.661 --> 13:17.195
The staff are really incredible.

13:18.931 --> 13:18.930
- <i>Please note that the loading</i>

13:18.932 --> 13:23.401
<i>and unloading areas are
for emergency vehicles only.</i>

13:23.403 --> 13:26.537
<i>Illegally parked vehicles
will be towed.</i>

13:26.872 --> 13:29.173
- Hey, do we need to sign in?

13:29.175 --> 13:30.742
- That's okay, Mr. Milgrom.

13:30.744 --> 13:32.377
- Thanks.

13:33.879 --> 13:36.581
You're so talkative.
I can never shut you up.

13:36.583 --> 13:38.549
- You're such a weirdo.

13:40.452 --> 13:44.288
- So...
You're an athletics coach?

13:44.290 --> 13:46.557
I always admired people
who can stay in shape.

13:46.559 --> 13:48.426
I'm just lazy.

13:48.428 --> 13:51.295
I sit and watch monster trucks
and rallying.

13:51.297 --> 13:52.697
Don't suppose you'd be into that

13:52.699 --> 13:55.233
what with you
being hit by a car.

13:55.235 --> 13:58.870
Oh, I was, er,
just finishing up her bath.

14:02.341 --> 14:04.375
- So, how's she doing today?

14:04.377 --> 14:06.911
- We may need to adjust
her medication.

14:06.913 --> 14:09.414
The painkillers are causing
some hallucinations.

14:09.416 --> 14:11.849
She thought there was somebody
in her room last night.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.317
- Maybe somebody walked in.

14:13.319 --> 14:14.752
- None of the patients
on this wing

14:14.754 --> 14:16.954
are walking around
at night, trust me.

14:16.956 --> 14:18.856
I'll talk to
miss Leaming about it.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.858
In the meantime, you might
wanna get the psychiatrist

14:20.860 --> 14:20.858
to talk to her.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.928
It's probably just
an anxiety attack.

14:23.930 --> 14:25.797
It happens.

14:35.274 --> 14:38.910
- Hey, Gemma, can I speak
to your mom for a second?

14:41.346 --> 14:42.713
- I love you.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.515
- Love you too.

14:47.619 --> 14:49.454
- Hey, honey.

14:54.460 --> 14:56.961
So, what's this about
someone in your room?

14:57.930 --> 15:01.566
<i>- Someone was
watching me last night.</i>

15:01.568 --> 15:03.501
- Are you sure?

15:03.503 --> 15:05.670
Did they say anything?

15:05.672 --> 15:07.271
-<i> No.</i>

15:07.273 --> 15:11.375
<i>Couldn't turn my head
to see them.</i>

15:11.377 --> 15:13.444
<i>Just heard them.</i>

15:13.446 --> 15:15.046
- Well, the ventilator's
on all night.

15:15.048 --> 15:16.914
Maybe...

15:16.916 --> 15:19.083
It sounds like
someone breathing.

15:26.493 --> 15:28.960
-<i> I don't like this place.</i>

15:35.334 --> 15:37.802
<i>- Look, we never thought
anything like this</i>

15:37.804 --> 15:39.070
<i>could ever happen.</i>

15:39.072 --> 15:41.772
<i>This is all the
insurance will cover.</i>

15:41.774 --> 15:41.772
<i>For now.</i>

15:41.774 --> 15:45.910
<i>- Can't you stay here with me?
Please.</i>

15:45.912 --> 15:48.579
- <i>What about Gemma?</i>
- I'm not a child.

15:49.715 --> 15:51.816
<i>I don't need anybody
watching me.</i>

15:51.818 --> 15:53.784
<i>You can stay here with mom.</i>

18:03.782 --> 18:06.083
I hope I didn't frighten you.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.818
I didn't know there
was anyone in here.

18:07.820 --> 18:09.020
- Sorry, I...

18:09.022 --> 18:10.921
Guess I shouldn't
be wandering around.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.991
- I'm Elizabeth Leaming,
the director here.

18:13.993 --> 18:16.494
You're Dana Milgrom's
daughter, isn't that right?

18:16.496 --> 18:17.695
- Yes.
I'm Gemma.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.797
- Yes, I've seen you
before visiting her.

18:19.799 --> 18:22.800
She's very lucky to have
your love and support.

18:22.802 --> 18:24.702
- I don't think she feels
very lucky right now.

18:24.704 --> 18:26.504
- Maybe not right now.

18:26.506 --> 18:28.239
But things will improve.

18:28.241 --> 18:30.074
You'll see.

18:42.688 --> 18:44.588
- Can you feel this one?

18:44.923 --> 18:46.857
- Mmm.

18:48.126 --> 18:50.227
- That's your ring finger.

18:52.064 --> 18:55.066
- <i>Sorry I'm so much trouble.</i>

18:55.934 --> 18:59.070
<i>Maybe you should have
stuck with Hannah.</i>

18:59.072 --> 19:01.706
What, after sixteen years
and one child,

19:01.708 --> 19:04.775
you're apologizing for
stealing me from my first wife?

19:04.777 --> 19:07.178
It's a bit late for that,
don't you think?

19:07.180 --> 19:09.513
Plus, you're much younger,

19:09.515 --> 19:11.082
much hotter.

19:11.717 --> 19:13.884
Which reminds me...

19:13.886 --> 19:15.886
I was speaking to Jim

19:15.888 --> 19:17.755
and he's gonna let me
take over the men's

19:17.757 --> 19:19.657
as well as the women's squad...

19:19.659 --> 19:21.792
Until you're better.

19:21.993 --> 19:23.761
Look,

19:23.763 --> 19:26.063
this is the new girl
I was telling you about,

19:26.065 --> 19:27.298
Ashley.

19:27.300 --> 19:30.000
She transferred in
a couple of weeks ago.

19:30.168 --> 19:31.969
You're gonna love her.

19:31.971 --> 19:34.271
She's a total winner.

19:34.273 --> 19:36.006
Never quits.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.875
Never says no.

19:42.715 --> 19:44.849
Are you ready to go?

19:44.851 --> 19:46.984
I think mom's a little tired.

19:47.919 --> 19:49.787
Okay, honey.

19:53.625 --> 19:55.826
See you tomorrow.

20:57.155 --> 20:58.889
- Forgive me.

20:59.391 --> 21:01.959
Let me turn on a light.

21:07.999 --> 21:10.201
How are you today, Dana?

21:18.977 --> 21:20.778
- <i>Scare me.</i>

21:20.780 --> 21:22.780
<i>Didn't know you were there.</i>

21:23.882 --> 21:26.684
I hear you're
having some issues.

21:26.686 --> 21:29.420
Feelings that
you're being watched.

21:29.422 --> 21:31.188
You want to talk about it?

21:32.958 --> 21:36.193
- I can't talk.

21:41.366 --> 21:45.002
<i>I can't talk.
Hole in my throat.</i>

21:45.004 --> 21:47.137
- That's a great sign.

21:47.139 --> 21:49.373
Humor is life affirming.

21:49.375 --> 21:51.408
- Hmm.

21:54.112 --> 21:57.181
<i>Life is life affirming.</i>

21:58.183 --> 22:00.084
<i>Death is nothing.</i>

22:00.086 --> 22:01.385
<i>I know.</i>

22:01.387 --> 22:03.320
<i>Was dead.</i>

22:03.688 --> 22:05.322
- Technically, yes.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.057
You were dead for
two or three minutes

22:07.059 --> 22:09.894
before the paramedics
revived you.

22:11.062 --> 22:14.164
<i>Do you have any memory
of that experience?</i>

22:22.408 --> 22:23.941
-<i> No memory.</i>

22:23.943 --> 22:27.278
<i>Just voices.
All around me.</i>

22:27.280 --> 22:30.347
- Who was it, paramedics?

22:30.349 --> 22:31.482
-<i> No.</i>

22:31.484 --> 22:33.117
<i>Dead people.</i>

22:33.119 --> 22:35.052
<i>Grabbing at me.</i>

22:35.054 --> 22:37.354
<i>I could feel their hands.</i>

22:37.356 --> 22:41.225
<i>I could feel their fingernails
digging into my skin.</i>

22:41.227 --> 22:43.227
<i>Pulling me down.</i>

22:43.895 --> 22:47.197
- Now you say you feel
you're being watched?

22:51.803 --> 22:54.471
<i>- Something not right
about this place.</i>

22:55.407 --> 22:57.975
<i>I can sense it.</i>

22:57.977 --> 23:00.311
<i>Nobody wants to listen.</i>

23:00.313 --> 23:02.913
<i>They treat me like a child.</i>

23:02.915 --> 23:06.517
- Nothing bad is going
to happen to you, Dana.

23:06.519 --> 23:08.986
You're safe here.

23:08.988 --> 23:11.188
We all want to help you.

23:25.270 --> 23:28.539
- <i>I wish Steve was here.</i>

23:28.541 --> 23:30.374
<i>Or Gemma.</i>

23:31.409 --> 23:34.078
<i>I miss watching her sleep.</i>

23:36.181 --> 23:38.148
<i>When she was a baby</i>

23:38.350 --> 23:41.218
<i>I would check on her
all the time,</i>

23:42.988 --> 23:45.422
<i>make sure she was breathing.</i>

23:49.060 --> 23:52.563
<i>Just feel so alone without them.</i>

25:42.240 --> 25:44.241
- Hey.

25:45.977 --> 25:48.045
- Someone...

25:49.013 --> 25:54.952
Someone turned off machine.

25:54.954 --> 25:56.987
- What?

26:03.495 --> 26:06.196
- <i>A man turned off the machine.</i>

26:06.198 --> 26:08.365
<i>I saw him.</i>

26:09.934 --> 26:11.435
- Him who?

26:13.506 --> 26:15.339
-<i> Don't know.</i>

26:15.341 --> 26:18.408
<i>Awful face.
Long hands.</i>

26:18.410 --> 26:21.211
<i>Not just watching me anymore.</i>

26:44.002 --> 26:45.302
- So just use the mouse pad

26:45.304 --> 26:47.738
to click on whichever
camera you want to...

26:47.740 --> 26:51.375
The two in here and the one
in the corridor outside.

26:52.977 --> 26:55.078
Zoom in and out using the stick

26:55.080 --> 26:58.015
and there's limited panning
left to right.

26:58.017 --> 27:00.751
Trust me, no-one's
gonna sneak up on you now.

27:15.700 --> 27:17.534
- Oh my god.

27:18.403 --> 27:20.771
I didn't know
that's what I looked like.

27:31.749 --> 27:33.350
- Hi.

27:34.686 --> 27:37.120
Yeah, I'm with Dana right now.

27:37.122 --> 27:39.423
Listen, I really appreciate
you getting her.

27:39.425 --> 27:41.325
You're a life saver.

27:41.327 --> 27:43.193
Okay.

27:43.428 --> 27:45.796
I'll see you later
back at the house.

27:45.798 --> 27:47.798
Okay. Bye.

27:50.602 --> 27:52.369
That was Ashley.

27:52.371 --> 27:55.806
Remember, the new girl
on the team?

27:55.808 --> 27:58.809
She agreed to give Gemma
a lift home from school.

27:58.811 --> 28:00.210
- Ah.

28:00.212 --> 28:02.412
- I couldn't think
who else to call

28:02.414 --> 28:05.282
- with all this craziness going on.
- Mmm.

28:14.125 --> 28:16.126
- Excuse me.

28:22.300 --> 28:24.701
- I see they've installed
the cameras, that's good.

28:24.703 --> 28:27.070
That should put
Dana's mind at ease.

28:27.072 --> 28:28.805
I don't think her mind
will be "at ease"

28:28.807 --> 28:31.642
until we find out who
shut off that ventilator.

28:31.644 --> 28:33.844
<i>- You're still insisting
that somebody intentionally</i>

28:33.846 --> 28:35.545
<i>switched off
her breathing machine?</i>

28:35.547 --> 28:37.180
-<i> Which is what she saw.</i>

28:37.182 --> 28:38.849
<i>- Which would be
attempted murder.</i>

28:38.851 --> 28:38.849
<i>The machine failed.</i>

28:38.851 --> 28:43.086
<i>And I'm incredibly
apologetic about that.</i>

28:43.088 --> 28:45.756
<i>We had it inspected.
It was a freak occurrence.</i>

28:45.758 --> 28:47.691
-<i> Just take care of her!</i>

28:47.693 --> 28:50.160
<i>Or so help me god,
I'll sue the arse off you</i>

28:50.162 --> 28:52.195
<i>and this hospital.</i>

29:10.748 --> 29:13.617
<i>- This is absolutely
unacceptable.</i>

29:13.619 --> 29:15.285
<i>Thank god it wasn't worse.</i>

29:15.287 --> 29:16.820
It could've been
a total disaster!

29:16.822 --> 29:18.722
- I've been telling you this
for a long time,

29:18.724 --> 29:20.290
we've got electrical issues.

29:20.292 --> 29:21.892
D'you know what's
in these walls?

29:21.894 --> 29:23.593
Cloth wiring.

29:23.595 --> 29:26.196
See what I mean?

29:31.769 --> 29:34.805
There's rats in there the
size of bloody pit bulls.

29:36.240 --> 29:39.242
- That's why I keep this handy.
- Trevor, that is enough!

29:39.244 --> 29:40.644
We are supposed
to have back-up

29:40.646 --> 29:42.579
for our critical
care assistants.

29:42.581 --> 29:46.650
Mrs. Milgrom's ventilator
is never supposed to fail.

29:46.652 --> 29:46.650
Ever!

29:46.652 --> 29:49.519
- Well, maybes if I wasn't
doing the job of three people,

29:49.521 --> 29:51.188
I'd be able to deal with it.

29:51.190 --> 29:53.190
I'm a fully qualified
nurse's aide.

29:53.192 --> 29:56.393
All this handyman shit isn't
part of my job description.

29:56.395 --> 29:58.762
- We all have our
crosses to bear.

30:03.801 --> 30:06.570
- See, cloth wiring.

30:15.179 --> 30:16.947
- Goodnight.
- See you tomorrow.

31:23.849 --> 31:26.283
- <i>What are you looking at?</i>

31:28.986 --> 31:31.054
<i>You don't talk much.</i>

31:31.389 --> 31:33.390
<i>Do you like it here?</i>

31:34.392 --> 31:37.494
<i>Shake one for yes, two for no.</i>

31:45.803 --> 31:47.704
<i>Me neither.</i>

31:48.639 --> 31:50.373
<i>Glad we agree.</i>

31:56.814 --> 31:58.715
Hello?

31:58.717 --> 32:00.650
Who is it?

32:06.492 --> 32:08.725
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

32:19.570 --> 32:22.706
<i>Are you patient here?
Like me?</i>

32:35.319 --> 32:37.754
<i>I have a breathing tube.</i>

32:37.756 --> 32:41.391
<i>Hard to talk.
Can you talk?</i>

32:48.733 --> 32:51.835
<i>I saw someone in my room.</i>

32:52.870 --> 32:55.105
<i>I think he tried to kill me.</i>

33:00.478 --> 33:02.812
<i>Have you seen him too?</i>

33:10.488 --> 33:13.456
<i>Hello?
Are you still there?</i>

34:46.884 --> 34:50.085
Eric Nilsson.

35:26.126 --> 35:27.625
- <i>Paging doctor Stengel.</i>

35:27.626 --> 35:31.494
<i>Please contact the nurse's
station on the second floor.</i>

35:31.496 --> 35:34.264
<i>Doctor Stengel, please,
second floor.</i>

35:37.668 --> 35:40.136
- How's my little
sweetheart doing?

35:43.107 --> 35:45.508
- <i>Can I ask you something?</i>

35:45.510 --> 35:47.043
<i>You tell me honestly?</i>

35:47.045 --> 35:49.179
- Yeah, sure.
What about?

35:49.181 --> 35:51.948
-<i> About Eric Nilsson.</i>

35:51.950 --> 35:54.017
- I've never heard
that name before.

35:56.187 --> 35:58.021
-<i> Nurse who worked here.</i>

35:58.023 --> 36:01.591
<i>He killed himself in 1984.</i>

36:01.593 --> 36:03.093
- It's a bit before
my time that.

36:03.095 --> 36:04.928
I was only born in 1980.

36:09.834 --> 36:13.069
<i>- What do you know
about Eric Nilsson?</i>

36:13.071 --> 36:15.672
- Look, I get paid minimum wage

36:15.674 --> 36:17.540
to clean pans and bed sores.

36:17.542 --> 36:20.076
I don't know anything
about anything.

36:20.078 --> 36:20.076
If you wanna know more,

36:20.078 --> 36:23.279
ask your head shrinker,
doctor Dracula.

36:23.281 --> 36:24.981
He's an expert on Nilsson.

36:24.983 --> 36:27.150
He's been working here
since back then.

36:42.633 --> 36:44.000
- Who's next door?

36:44.002 --> 36:45.668
- Next door?
- Mmm.

36:45.670 --> 36:46.803
- You mean Ellie?

36:46.805 --> 36:49.139
- Yeah, Ellie.
Who is she?

36:49.141 --> 36:51.775
- Older lady.
She had a stroke.

36:51.777 --> 36:53.977
She's been here a while.

36:53.979 --> 36:55.979
I don't think
she's got any family.

36:55.981 --> 36:57.781
No-one comes to visit her.

36:57.783 --> 36:59.816
It's a bit sad really.

37:03.320 --> 37:05.054
- What's wrong?

37:05.723 --> 37:06.990
- Nothing.

37:06.992 --> 37:09.592
It's just more bed sores.

37:09.594 --> 37:11.394
- Trevor, let me see.

37:11.996 --> 37:13.730
- Calm down.

37:15.833 --> 37:17.233
- Oh my...

37:19.103 --> 37:20.904
- Settle down.
You'll hurt yourself.

37:20.906 --> 37:22.639
- Trevor...

37:24.742 --> 37:27.110
Trevor, stop it!

37:32.349 --> 37:35.118
Trevor, please, don't!

37:35.120 --> 37:37.353
Trevor, no, please...

37:41.959 --> 37:44.994
Trevor...
Please, don't...

37:50.167 --> 37:52.035
- Settle down.
You'll upset yourself.

37:52.037 --> 37:54.204
- Please, I don't
want to go to sleep.

37:54.206 --> 37:56.172
He'll get me while I sleep.

37:56.174 --> 37:59.876
He'll get me while I sleep,
Trevor.

38:52.329 --> 38:56.199
<i>- You know that Eric Nilsson
has been dead...</i>

38:56.201 --> 38:58.801
<i>For nearly thirty years?</i>

39:06.044 --> 39:09.279
<i>- Trevor says you know
all about Nilsson.</i>

39:09.281 --> 39:12.515
<i>You worked here with him.
Is that true?</i>

39:13.417 --> 39:17.353
- I am not sure I like where
that question is leading.

39:19.156 --> 39:21.824
-<i> You don't like the question...</i>

39:21.826 --> 39:24.027
<i>Don't answer.</i>

39:24.428 --> 39:26.729
- Alright.

39:26.731 --> 39:31.234
If I tell you, will you promise
me to take it at face value?

39:31.236 --> 39:34.070
No boogeymen?
No evil spirits?

39:34.072 --> 39:35.805
- Yes.

39:35.807 --> 39:38.875
- The first time
I met Eric Nilsson,

39:38.877 --> 39:41.277
he wasn't working here.

39:41.279 --> 39:45.181
He was brought in
as a patient, in 1972.

39:47.184 --> 39:49.819
<i>I honestly don't know
much about his past.</i>

39:49.821 --> 39:52.855
<i>The records were
sealed in his case.</i>

39:54.124 --> 39:55.858
<i>He'd been in foster care</i>

39:55.860 --> 39:58.962
<i>and had obviously been
the victim of abuse.</i>

40:00.030 --> 40:02.031
<i>The most heartbreaking thing is</i>

40:02.033 --> 40:05.168
<i>many of his injuries
were self-inflicted.</i>

40:05.170 --> 40:09.305
<i>We had to keep his fingernails
clipped short every day.</i>

40:09.307 --> 40:12.208
<i>To stop him from tearing
at his own flesh.</i>

40:13.777 --> 40:15.912
He improved over time.

40:15.914 --> 40:17.447
I continued to work with him,

40:17.449 --> 40:21.084
to help him heal his physical
and emotional scars.

40:21.086 --> 40:25.254
Over the years he came to feel
that Hopewell was his home.

40:25.256 --> 40:28.491
When he became an adult
he even asked for a job here.

40:30.060 --> 40:32.829
It seemed the most
natural thing to everyone.

40:32.831 --> 40:35.331
Eric was part of
the place by then.

40:37.434 --> 40:39.335
- Go on.

40:40.404 --> 40:43.906
- He seemed completely cured

40:43.908 --> 40:47.343
except for one
lingering obsession.

40:47.345 --> 40:50.513
He made a point of grooming
the children's hands.

40:50.515 --> 40:52.548
Clipping their nails.

40:52.550 --> 40:55.451
But instead of
throwing the clippings out,

40:55.453 --> 40:57.487
he used to collect them.

40:57.489 --> 41:00.323
Save them in little envelopes.

41:00.325 --> 41:02.258
We all thought it was
just a harmless echo

41:02.260 --> 41:04.527
of what he'd gone through.

41:04.529 --> 41:09.098
But some of the staff gave him
a nickname because of it.

41:09.100 --> 41:12.235
They used to call him "nails".

41:21.146 --> 41:23.479
- <i>What happened to nails?</i>

41:23.481 --> 41:28.918
- In 1984, shortly after
he started work here,

41:28.920 --> 41:32.555
we had an unusual
number of child deaths.

41:32.557 --> 41:35.491
Five, in fact.
All girls.

41:36.126 --> 41:38.294
The police investigated.

41:38.296 --> 41:43.533
Nothing was ever proved,
but suspicion fell on Eric.

41:43.535 --> 41:47.403
And when they found those little
packets of fingernail clippings

41:47.405 --> 41:49.138
from the dead girls...

41:56.547 --> 41:58.314
<i>Why did he kill the girls?</i>

41:58.316 --> 42:01.551
- I've asked myself that
for the past thirty years.

42:01.553 --> 42:05.154
Eric seemed genuinely
devoted to those girls.

42:06.090 --> 42:10.560
I think in his own twisted mind
he was freeing them.

42:10.562 --> 42:14.230
Saving them from the
abuse that he'd endured.

42:14.232 --> 42:16.699
They'd stay innocent forever.

42:18.569 --> 42:20.570
And then he hanged himself.

42:33.217 --> 42:35.318
<i>- Where did nails kill himself?</i>

42:35.320 --> 42:37.186
- That's not important.

42:39.690 --> 42:42.225
-<i> Was it here at the hospital?</i>

42:42.659 --> 42:44.694
<i>Was it here in my room?</i>

42:45.996 --> 42:47.530
<i>In that cupboard?</i>

42:47.532 --> 42:50.032
- I've already said
more than I should.

42:50.034 --> 42:54.103
Eric Nilsson is dead
and gone, Dana.

42:54.105 --> 42:57.073
His tortured soul is at rest.

42:57.075 --> 42:59.475
He is not coming back.

43:18.095 --> 43:19.395
-<i> Hey, mom.</i>

43:19.397 --> 43:21.597
<i>Hope I'm not calling too late.</i>

43:22.566 --> 43:24.400
<i>Are you okay?</i>

43:25.235 --> 43:26.469
- <i>Yes.</i>

43:26.471 --> 43:28.638
<i>This is my happy face.</i>

43:28.640 --> 43:31.240
<i>Same as my angry face.</i>

43:32.476 --> 43:32.475
- I wanted to come
to the hospital,

43:32.477 --> 43:37.680
but dad said I've missed so
much school with your recovery.

43:37.682 --> 43:39.248
- He's right.

43:39.250 --> 43:41.317
-<i> He feels...</i>

43:41.319 --> 43:43.419
I don't know how to say it.

43:44.121 --> 43:46.389
I think he feels responsible.

43:46.391 --> 43:48.591
<i>Like he's failed you somehow.</i>

43:51.461 --> 43:53.629
- He hasn't.

43:54.264 --> 43:56.499
-<i> It's just so hard.</i>

43:56.501 --> 43:57.700
He's on the phone all day

43:57.702 --> 44:00.403
with these dickhead
insurance people.

44:00.405 --> 44:03.139
Sorry, shouldn't swear.

44:03.141 --> 44:05.341
- It's okay.

44:05.343 --> 44:07.543
You swear all the time.

44:07.545 --> 44:09.278
Don't think I know.

44:09.280 --> 44:11.247
<i>- Here, I brought you
some snacks.</i>

44:11.249 --> 44:13.282
<i>- Thanks.
I'm just talking to mom.</i>

44:13.284 --> 44:15.051
- Oh, hi, Mrs. Milgrom.

44:15.053 --> 44:16.786
I'm Ashley from the track team.

44:19.258 --> 44:20.157
- <i>Yes.</i>

44:20.158 --> 44:24.060
<i>Steve said you were
helping with Gemma.</i>

44:24.062 --> 44:25.695
- Oh, wow, is that...

44:25.697 --> 44:28.164
Does that thing talk for you?

44:29.633 --> 44:32.168
<i>Er, I'm sorry to interrupt
your mother-daughter time.</i>

44:32.170 --> 44:34.303
It's just I've heard so much
about you from Steve.

44:34.305 --> 44:35.638
He says you're
an incredible coach.

44:35.640 --> 44:37.573
<i>I can't wait for you
to coach me.</i>

44:42.346 --> 44:44.547
<i>- Bye, mom.
Love you.</i>

44:45.315 --> 44:47.183
- Bye.

45:42.439 --> 45:44.273
- <i>Ellie?</i>

45:48.378 --> 45:51.347
<i>Ellie, can you hear me?</i>

45:58.121 --> 46:00.356
<i>I want to talk to you.</i>

46:51.708 --> 46:53.209
- It's okay.
It's me.

46:53.211 --> 46:53.209
It's Trevor.
It's okay.

46:53.211 --> 46:56.445
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

47:13.330 --> 47:14.463
- Here, let me do it.

47:14.465 --> 47:18.234
- No.
I have to do it myself.

47:24.307 --> 47:26.976
There.
You see him?

47:28.311 --> 47:29.912
You see?

47:35.218 --> 47:37.286
- I'm sorry, honey, but...

47:38.522 --> 47:40.356
what am I supposed to be seeing?

47:40.358 --> 47:44.326
- It's, it's there.
Nails.

47:44.328 --> 47:48.230
Eric Nilsson.
That horrible thing.

47:48.232 --> 47:49.932
Why can't you see him?

47:49.934 --> 47:52.601
- I wish I could see something.

47:52.603 --> 47:53.636
Anything.

47:53.638 --> 47:56.372
All I can see is
Trevor running in.

48:00.778 --> 48:02.778
- Listen, it's gonna be okay.

48:02.780 --> 48:04.413
Look...

48:04.415 --> 48:06.749
I'll go and talk to Trevor.

48:06.751 --> 48:08.384
Maybe he did see something.

48:08.386 --> 48:12.621
- Trevor is my friend.

48:12.623 --> 48:16.292
He's the only one I can trust.

48:19.262 --> 48:20.930
- I'm glad you feel
you can trust him.

48:20.932 --> 48:23.499
- He saved my life.

48:25.402 --> 48:27.036
- Great.

48:27.938 --> 48:29.772
What a guy.

48:34.678 --> 48:35.945
You know, I'm not sure
these cameras

48:35.947 --> 48:37.680
were such a good idea.

48:37.682 --> 48:39.815
-<i> What do you mean?</i>

48:39.817 --> 48:42.351
<i>- They're just
reinforcing your fears.</i>

48:42.353 --> 48:46.055
<i>- No, they're my
only protection.</i>

48:52.662 --> 48:53.929
- They're just
making you paranoid.

48:53.931 --> 48:55.297
- No.
No, please.

48:55.299 --> 48:57.967
Please don't take
them away, Steve.

48:57.969 --> 48:59.835
Please.

48:59.837 --> 49:01.570
Steve.

49:05.575 --> 49:07.376
Steve!

49:09.346 --> 49:12.081
- Maybe you should go and
keep your mother company.

49:20.624 --> 49:23.092
I don't know what to think.

49:24.461 --> 49:25.995
She's absolutely certain
there's something

49:25.997 --> 49:28.097
in the surveillance video.

49:29.866 --> 49:32.801
- You hear the knocking sound?

49:32.803 --> 49:35.070
- A knocking sound?

49:35.072 --> 49:39.942
Yeah, maybe there's
some kind of noise.

49:39.944 --> 49:42.111
- Ellie.
Next door.

49:42.113 --> 49:46.615
She tried to wake me up.
She tried to warn me.

49:46.617 --> 49:50.853
She knows...
All about nails.

49:50.855 --> 49:54.056
You go and ask her.
She'll tell you.

49:54.058 --> 49:57.159
- Okay.
I'll talk to her.

49:57.727 --> 50:00.396
<i>- We have many other
patients at this facility...</i>

50:00.398 --> 50:02.498
<i>And none of them
are reporting people</i>

50:02.500 --> 50:04.867
<i>creeping into their rooms.</i>

50:04.869 --> 50:07.469
<i>Only your wife.</i>

50:13.743 --> 50:16.445
- It's not uncommon for
patients who've suffered

50:16.447 --> 50:20.516
severe brain injury
to have paranoid visions.

50:20.518 --> 50:21.951
- Oh yeah?

50:21.953 --> 50:23.819
Well, it's only after
she came here to recover

50:23.821 --> 50:25.754
that she started seeing things.

50:25.756 --> 50:27.823
- Hello?

50:28.758 --> 50:30.426
Ellie?

50:30.794 --> 50:33.696
My name is Gemma Milgrom.

50:34.598 --> 50:37.700
My mother Dana
is in the room next door.

50:47.811 --> 50:49.678
My mom...

50:49.680 --> 50:51.947
She said you were knocking

50:51.949 --> 50:54.149
on the wall.

50:54.151 --> 50:57.853
Trying to warn her
about something.

50:57.855 --> 51:02.057
She thinks there's
something trying to hurt her.

51:02.059 --> 51:06.228
A nurse who used to work here
named Eric Nilsson.

51:11.868 --> 51:13.569
I'm sorry.

51:18.076 --> 51:18.975
- Dad.

51:18.976 --> 51:21.677
<i>- Gemma, what were
you doing in there?</i>

51:21.679 --> 51:24.513
- That woman.
She had some kind of attack.

52:41.760 --> 52:42.659
- Right.

52:42.660 --> 52:45.661
No-one's getting
in or out of there.

52:45.663 --> 52:47.696
No way, no how.

52:47.698 --> 52:49.598
- It's no good.

52:49.600 --> 52:50.699
Won't help.

52:50.701 --> 52:50.699
- Sure it will.

52:50.701 --> 52:53.702
You'd need a fire axe
to get through there.

52:53.704 --> 52:56.171
- It's not a person.

52:56.173 --> 52:58.574
It's an evil thing.

52:58.576 --> 53:00.042
- Come on now.

53:00.044 --> 53:01.877
- Trevor, you saw it.

53:01.879 --> 53:03.579
I know you saw it.

53:03.581 --> 53:05.047
- I didn't see anything.

53:09.819 --> 53:11.587
- <i>I talked to Stengel.</i>

53:11.589 --> 53:13.956
<i>He told me nails
killed children.</i>

53:14.591 --> 53:17.659
<i>Then nails killed himself.
In this room.</i>

53:17.661 --> 53:19.361
- In here?

53:24.567 --> 53:26.735
I didn't know that.

53:29.239 --> 53:31.907
<i>- Have there been
others who saw nails?</i>

53:31.909 --> 53:33.842
- No and I sure as hell haven't.

53:33.844 --> 53:33.842
- Yes, you have.

53:33.844 --> 53:36.979
- Look, you need to stop
talking about this.

53:36.981 --> 53:38.981
Spending all your time
looking at that computer

53:38.983 --> 53:38.981
and those cameras.

53:38.983 --> 53:42.651
It's putting a hex on your
brain all that radiation.

53:42.653 --> 53:43.986
Didn't your mother
ever tell you not to sit

53:43.988 --> 53:46.188
too close to the television?

53:49.592 --> 53:53.295
- Trevor, you have to
help me get out of here.

53:53.297 --> 53:55.397
I have to go home.

53:56.366 --> 53:58.801
- You will, but not yet.
You're not ready.

53:58.803 --> 54:01.370
- No, please, you have
to help me get out.

54:01.372 --> 54:04.006
- Look, I've got other
patients I've gotta see.

54:04.008 --> 54:04.940
I've gotta go.

54:04.942 --> 54:05.974
- Please.

54:05.976 --> 54:07.342
Trevor...

54:07.344 --> 54:09.378
Nobody believes me.

54:09.380 --> 54:12.347
- Look, I locked the
damn door, didn't I?!

54:13.750 --> 54:14.883
I'm not your husband.

54:14.885 --> 54:16.285
Get him to get you out of here.

54:16.287 --> 54:20.022
- He... he doesn't listen.

55:43.740 --> 55:44.773
- <i>People ask me:</i>

55:44.775 --> 55:46.375
<i>Why can I see ghosts?</i>

55:46.377 --> 55:46.375
<i>The answer is:</i>

55:46.377 --> 55:51.146
<i>I am gifted with a third eye
that allows me to perceive</i>

55:51.148 --> 55:54.082
<i>multi-dimensional beings
on many different plains.</i>

56:08.031 --> 56:10.132
-<i> Do you wanna talk about it:</i>

56:10.134 --> 56:13.101
<i>The second sight, your gift?</i>

56:14.170 --> 56:16.138
- <i>Gift?</i>

56:17.206 --> 56:19.441
<i>Yeah, well, I just wish
I could give this gift to you</i>

56:19.443 --> 56:22.911
<i>for a little while
and you see what it's like.</i>

56:22.913 --> 56:25.013
<i>I started seeing her, the...</i>

56:25.015 --> 56:26.448
<i>Spirit, the...</i>

56:26.450 --> 56:29.384
<i>The vapors,
whatever you wanna call it.</i>

56:29.386 --> 56:31.053
-<i> The gray woman?</i>

56:32.322 --> 56:33.889
-<i> Yeah.</i>

56:34.991 --> 56:38.026
<i>I started seeing her a couple
weeks after my accident.</i>

56:38.028 --> 56:39.928
<i>I work for the power company.</i>

56:39.930 --> 56:42.230
<i>I touched a live cable with...</i>

56:42.232 --> 56:45.033
<i>This hand, the crippled one.</i>

56:46.069 --> 56:49.338
<i>They say I was dead
for two or three minutes.</i>

56:49.340 --> 56:52.407
<i>I think maybe
that's why I see her.</i>

56:52.409 --> 56:54.343
<i>The gray woman.</i>

56:54.345 --> 56:57.913
<i>Cos I was dead, like her.</i>

56:57.915 --> 57:00.215
<i>- Is she...
Here now with us?</i>

57:00.217 --> 57:01.550
<i>The gray woman?</i>

58:27.204 --> 58:30.338
- Ms. Leaming, I need
to talk to you about Dana.

58:30.340 --> 58:32.441
I mean, Mrs. Milgrom.

58:32.443 --> 58:34.142
- What is it now?

58:34.444 --> 58:36.478
- The other night,

58:36.480 --> 58:40.148
when I came into her room,
when she pressed the buzzer...

58:42.051 --> 58:44.286
I thought I saw something.

58:45.054 --> 58:46.488
- Are you telling me

58:46.490 --> 58:50.225
that you saw the same
evil spirit as Mrs. Milgrom?

58:50.227 --> 58:52.627
- Not, not head on.

58:54.431 --> 58:56.631
- More felt it.

58:56.633 --> 58:58.667
It's, it's hard
to put it into words.

58:58.669 --> 59:00.635
- Have you talked to
anybody about this?

59:00.637 --> 59:03.438
- No, just Mrs. Milgrom.

59:03.440 --> 59:06.308
It's not me.
It's that doctor Stengel.

59:06.310 --> 59:08.410
He told her about
the children that died

59:08.412 --> 59:11.213
and about that nurse,
Eric Nilsson.

59:11.215 --> 59:13.515
Did you know about him?

59:14.484 --> 59:18.487
- Eric Nilsson was devoted
to those children.

59:18.489 --> 59:23.158
I don't believe he would ever
consciously harm any of them.

59:23.160 --> 59:26.495
- He stabbed five little girls
with a hypodermic.

59:26.497 --> 59:29.331
That's pretty fucked up,
even for a psychopath.

59:36.506 --> 59:38.974
- It has taken this
institution many years

59:38.976 --> 59:41.009
to put that behind us.

59:41.011 --> 59:43.979
Now I don't want people
dredging up old history.

59:43.981 --> 59:46.248
You have other patients
to look after.

59:46.250 --> 59:49.284
- Look, Ms. Leaming, I really
think Dana is in trouble.

59:49.286 --> 59:52.020
- This conversation is over!

01:00:36.098 --> 01:00:39.234
<i>- Now I understand
why I can see it.</i>

01:00:40.636 --> 01:00:42.938
<i>Because I was dead myself.</i>

01:00:46.709 --> 01:00:49.311
<i>I know there is something here.</i>

01:00:54.383 --> 01:00:57.285
<i>I still don't know
why it wants me.</i>

01:00:59.222 --> 01:01:01.456
<i>But I know its name is nails.</i>

01:01:07.296 --> 01:01:10.065
<i>I can say it without fear.</i>

01:01:12.702 --> 01:01:15.237
<i>There is power in that.</i>

01:01:18.174 --> 01:01:21.376
<i>I have survived
two attempts to kill me.</i>

01:01:22.078 --> 01:01:25.347
<i>Three if I count
the car accident.</i>

01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:27.749
<i>I am a survivor.</i>

01:01:27.751 --> 01:01:30.719
- <i>Nothing can, nothing...</i>

01:01:36.592 --> 01:01:39.594
<i>- You will die,
you will die in here...</i>

01:01:46.602 --> 01:01:48.503
<i>You will die in here.</i>

01:01:50.474 --> 01:01:52.240
- <i>Nobody here...</i>

01:01:52.242 --> 01:01:53.441
<i>will free you.</i>

01:01:53.443 --> 01:01:56.778
<i>Rip your skull.
Tear your flesh.</i>

01:01:56.780 --> 01:02:00.115
<i>Steve fucking Ashley
in your bed.</i>

01:02:22.171 --> 01:02:24.139
- Fuck.

01:02:53.602 --> 01:02:55.837
What...

01:02:55.839 --> 01:02:58.573
Do...

01:02:58.575 --> 01:03:02.177
You want...

01:03:02.179 --> 01:03:04.679
from me?

01:04:28.864 --> 01:04:31.433
- Yeah, have that, fucker!

01:05:16.645 --> 01:05:18.079
Dana?

01:06:48.103 --> 01:06:49.470
- I suppose you're gonna tell me

01:06:49.472 --> 01:06:51.539
it's her imagination now, huh?

01:06:51.541 --> 01:06:52.640
You see her legs.

01:06:52.642 --> 01:06:54.075
You see how he tortured her.

01:06:54.077 --> 01:06:55.510
- I assure you,

01:06:55.512 --> 01:06:57.078
we're doing everything
possible to find out

01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:57.078
who did this to your wife.

01:06:57.080 --> 01:07:00.748
- I think it's pretty damn
obvious who did it!

01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:02.517
It's that tattooed weirdo
you've had in here

01:07:02.519 --> 01:07:03.518
pawing her up.

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:04.786
- No, it wasn't Trevor.

01:07:04.788 --> 01:07:06.921
It wasn't Trevor.

01:07:06.923 --> 01:07:09.557
- I brought her as soon
as I got your call, Steve.

01:07:11.026 --> 01:07:12.794
- You called the police, right?

01:07:12.796 --> 01:07:15.029
- Well, I wanted
to reach you first.

01:07:15.031 --> 01:07:17.699
You don't really think we
need to involve the authorities?

01:07:17.701 --> 01:07:19.701
- Christ, is that
all you care about?

01:07:19.703 --> 01:07:22.937
You've got a maniac roaming
the halls torturing people!

01:07:25.174 --> 01:07:26.841
- Steve, please,
it wasn't Trevor.

01:07:26.843 --> 01:07:28.776
He didn't hurt me.

01:07:28.778 --> 01:07:30.645
- I'm sorry.

01:07:30.647 --> 01:07:33.648
Ms. Leaming found this
downstairs in Trevor's room.

01:07:35.417 --> 01:07:37.885
It's your file
from thirty years ago,

01:07:37.887 --> 01:07:40.588
under your maiden name Breiman.

01:07:40.590 --> 01:07:44.459
You were here as a child
when you had meningitis.

01:07:44.461 --> 01:07:46.461
And you were here
when Eric Nilsson

01:07:46.463 --> 01:07:48.563
killed those five girls.

01:07:50.132 --> 01:07:51.599
- No.

01:07:51.601 --> 01:07:54.569
- Trevor is some kind
of deranged copy-cat.

01:07:59.475 --> 01:08:01.609
- It's a lie!

01:08:09.887 --> 01:08:10.786
-<i> Hello?</i>

01:08:10.787 --> 01:08:15.490
- Yes, this is Elizabeth
Leaming at Hopewell hospital.

01:08:15.492 --> 01:08:17.558
<i>- Please state the nature
of your emergency.</i>

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:19.794
- One of our female patients
has been attacked.

01:08:19.796 --> 01:08:22.764
- No, it was nails.

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:24.966
Nails hurt me!

01:08:24.968 --> 01:08:27.001
- Jesus Christ, Dana.

01:08:27.002 --> 01:08:30.505
Stop it!
There is no nails!

01:08:30.506 --> 01:08:32.240
- You're a fucking idiot.

01:08:33.742 --> 01:08:35.943
And I'm sorry I married you.

01:08:37.179 --> 01:08:39.781
Nails is gonna kill us all.

01:08:39.783 --> 01:08:42.015
<i>- Please state the nature
of your emergency.</i>

01:08:42.018 --> 01:08:43.551
- I already told you!

01:08:43.553 --> 01:08:46.554
One of our patients has
been attacked in her bed.

01:08:46.555 --> 01:08:48.523
-<i> Has she been bad?</i>

01:08:48.524 --> 01:08:49.724
- What?

01:08:49.725 --> 01:08:51.826
-<i> Is that why he hurt her?</i>

01:08:51.828 --> 01:08:53.528
- Who is this?

01:08:53.529 --> 01:08:56.229
<i>- Turn around and I'll show you.</i>

01:09:01.569 --> 01:09:03.671
- You really do belong in a madhouse.
- Dad!

01:09:03.673 --> 01:09:05.807
- Steve, I don't mean to intrude

01:09:05.809 --> 01:09:07.575
on a family dispute, but...

01:09:07.577 --> 01:09:09.911
Dana is paralyzed and
she's under a lot of stress.

01:09:09.912 --> 01:09:12.180
- Shut up, you whore!
I don't need your fucking help!

01:09:12.182 --> 01:09:13.648
- Dana!

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:15.582
- It's alright.

01:09:16.151 --> 01:09:17.852
I'll go wait in the car, Steve.

01:09:17.854 --> 01:09:21.055
- Yeah, yeah, you stay away
from my family, you whore!

01:09:21.057 --> 01:09:22.957
- Calm down!
- I know what you did!

01:09:22.959 --> 01:09:24.524
I saw you with her!

01:09:24.527 --> 01:09:25.727
- What are you talking about?

01:09:25.729 --> 01:09:27.261
- I saw you with her
in our bedroom.

01:09:27.263 --> 01:09:29.964
It was nails.
He showed me on the computer.

01:09:29.966 --> 01:09:32.567
You fucked her.

01:09:32.569 --> 01:09:34.102
- I'm not listening
to this shit.

01:09:34.104 --> 01:09:35.737
- Yeah, run.
Run away.

01:09:35.738 --> 01:09:37.171
You always fucking run.

01:09:37.173 --> 01:09:39.107
You left your first wife for me.

01:09:39.109 --> 01:09:41.042
And now you leave me for Ashley

01:09:41.044 --> 01:09:43.944
because she is much
younger than me.

01:09:43.947 --> 01:09:46.948
She is much hotter than me.

01:09:46.950 --> 01:09:48.850
- You know what...

01:09:48.852 --> 01:09:50.551
I give up.

01:09:50.553 --> 01:09:52.687
- You are insane!
- Dad, stop it!

01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:54.322
Just stop it!

01:10:04.767 --> 01:10:06.701
- Where the fuck
is that woman with police?!

01:10:07.803 --> 01:10:09.337
You stay here with her.

01:10:09.339 --> 01:10:11.172
Try to calm her down.

01:10:11.174 --> 01:10:13.174
I'm gonna try and get help.

01:10:13.909 --> 01:10:15.610
- Dad...

01:10:20.115 --> 01:10:21.616
- Listen,

01:10:23.018 --> 01:10:24.819
do you believe me?

01:10:24.821 --> 01:10:25.953
- Yes.

01:10:25.955 --> 01:10:25.953
- No.

01:10:25.955 --> 01:10:30.224
Do you believe me about nails?

01:10:32.895 --> 01:10:35.029
Then you have to go.

01:10:35.031 --> 01:10:37.899
I can't run but you can.

01:10:37.901 --> 01:10:38.900
- No.

01:10:38.902 --> 01:10:40.835
- You have to leave me here.

01:10:40.837 --> 01:10:44.138
- I'm not going without you.
We'll both stay here.

01:10:55.350 --> 01:10:57.652
- Get me the wheelchair.

01:10:59.888 --> 01:11:01.756
- No, don't!

01:11:02.925 --> 01:11:04.992
- Gemma, I can breathe.

01:11:17.706 --> 01:11:20.174
Get the, the needle.

01:11:22.110 --> 01:11:24.045
Ah...

01:11:28.083 --> 01:11:29.116
Gemma, my neck.

01:11:29.118 --> 01:11:30.985
- I can't, mom.
I can't do it.

01:11:30.987 --> 01:11:33.354
- Gemma, you have to do it!

01:11:59.448 --> 01:12:01.482
- Oh my god.

01:12:02.417 --> 01:12:05.119
Come on.
Get up.

01:12:06.855 --> 01:12:09.257
- I'm too heavy.

01:12:09.259 --> 01:12:12.126
I'm too heavy.
Just leave me.

01:12:12.128 --> 01:12:14.462
- I'm not leaving you.
Get up.

01:12:15.364 --> 01:12:17.832
You are not going to die here.

01:12:17.834 --> 01:12:19.734
Now help me.

01:12:59.041 --> 01:13:00.908
- Ash?

01:13:02.811 --> 01:13:04.979
Ash, where are you?

01:13:30.105 --> 01:13:33.207
Jesus Christ,
what a fucking night.

01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:36.911
Ash?

01:13:56.798 --> 01:13:58.366
- Mom, I can't see
where we're going.

01:14:09.511 --> 01:14:11.145
- Gemma...

01:14:11.546 --> 01:14:13.848
- It's okay, mom, I'm okay.

01:14:31.133 --> 01:14:33.000
Is anybody there?

01:14:33.002 --> 01:14:34.502
Hello?

01:14:53.455 --> 01:14:55.156
- Mom?

01:15:07.335 --> 01:15:10.037
- Mom?
- Just do it.

01:15:11.573 --> 01:15:13.641
- Mom, I can't hold you.

01:15:20.982 --> 01:15:23.617
Mom, can you hear me?
Mom?

01:15:26.088 --> 01:15:27.621
- Help!

01:15:27.623 --> 01:15:30.191
Please, somebody help us.
My mom is injured.

01:15:30.193 --> 01:15:34.028
- No, please, just leave me,
will you leave me alone.

01:15:41.605 --> 01:15:42.504
- Who's there?

01:15:42.505 --> 01:15:45.339
I've been buzzing
and no-one's answering.

01:15:45.341 --> 01:15:47.108
- I'm sorry.
I can't help you.

01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:50.111
- Please, please.
Please don't leave me.

01:15:57.352 --> 01:15:58.986
- Mom?

01:15:58.988 --> 01:16:00.988
Mom, can you hear me?

01:16:00.990 --> 01:16:02.690
Mom?

01:16:29.151 --> 01:16:31.018
Hello?!

01:16:40.028 --> 01:16:42.263
- What on earth
is going on here?

01:16:42.265 --> 01:16:44.031
My god, Mrs. Milgrom,
what happened to you?

01:16:44.033 --> 01:16:44.031
What are you doing out of bed?

01:16:44.033 --> 01:16:46.500
- Please, we have to go.
He's coming.

01:16:46.502 --> 01:16:46.500
- He who?

01:16:46.502 --> 01:16:48.736
You're bleeding.
Your face is cut.

01:16:48.738 --> 01:16:50.571
- Please, just take Gemma.

01:16:50.573 --> 01:16:52.206
- No, I'm not leaving you.

01:16:52.208 --> 01:16:53.607
- I don't know what's going on,

01:16:53.609 --> 01:16:55.643
but your mother needs medical
attention immediately.

01:16:55.645 --> 01:16:58.646
And you may need a sedative,
young lady.

01:16:59.548 --> 01:17:01.649
Jesus Christ!

01:17:01.651 --> 01:17:04.552
You're as batshit crazy
as your mother!

01:17:59.574 --> 01:18:00.641
No.

01:18:00.643 --> 01:18:03.344
What are you doing?!
Open the door!

01:18:06.081 --> 01:18:08.249
- I love you.

01:18:08.251 --> 01:18:12.086
I will always love you.

01:18:12.088 --> 01:18:15.256
You're...
You're so beautiful.

01:18:15.258 --> 01:18:17.258
And you are so brave.

01:18:18.761 --> 01:18:23.397
- And I will never
let anybody hurt you.

01:18:23.399 --> 01:18:25.266
- Mom, don't do this.

01:18:25.268 --> 01:18:28.402
Open the door.
Mom!

01:18:29.404 --> 01:18:31.272
Stop it.

01:18:31.274 --> 01:18:33.407
Please!

01:20:24.519 --> 01:20:26.520
- Can you hear me?

01:20:27.622 --> 01:20:29.857
Can you tell me what happened?

01:20:31.292 --> 01:20:33.594
Do you know who did this to you?

01:20:36.364 --> 01:20:38.265
- It was nails.

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:40.534
He killed her.

01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:43.804
He killed my mom.

01:20:44.339 --> 01:20:46.306
- Who is nails?

01:21:46.568 --> 01:21:49.303
- <i>I don't feel safe here.</i>

01:21:53.508 --> 01:21:57.711
<i>Someone in my room
last night watching me.</i>

01:21:59.514 --> 01:22:01.315
<i>Take me home.</i>

01:22:01.317 --> 01:22:03.383
<i>Please.</i>

01:22:12.293 --> 01:22:13.627
<i>I want to go home.</i>
