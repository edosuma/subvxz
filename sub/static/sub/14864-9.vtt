WEBVTT

02:03.249 --> 02:05.331
We should go.

02:05.459 --> 02:07.495
Night is coming.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.789
They sleep standing up, you know.

02:11.757 --> 02:13.839
Elephants.

02:14.802 --> 02:19.887
On account, once laid down,
they cannot rise again.

02:20.016 --> 02:23.474
Is that so? I was not aware.

02:35.323 --> 02:38.656
— We should go.
- Where?

02:40.202 --> 02:43.035
Utica is not far.

02:43.164 --> 02:44.904
Utica.

02:46.083 --> 02:47.619
What's there for us?

02:47.752 --> 02:50.619
Shelter. Food.

02:51.922 --> 02:53.833
I need neither.

02:55.426 --> 02:58.793
— Sleep, then.
— Sleep would be pleasant.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.018
So...

03:06.020 --> 03:08.136
Utica, then.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.071
Dear me.

03:58.739 --> 04:01.230
Really, Aquinas, is this the best we can do?

04:01.367 --> 04:04.234
No matter.

04:05.413 --> 04:09.031
— Bring water for washing.
— And bread and wine.

04:14.588 --> 04:17.625
I think I shall make myself drunk tonight.

04:17.758 --> 04:21.467
— Perhaps, just this once, you will join me.
— I think not.

04:23.305 --> 04:25.136
Cheer up. We live.

04:25.266 --> 04:28.474
- We do. We live.
— And where there's life, there's hope.

04:28.602 --> 04:34.472
I'm afraid if we have done anything, old friend,
we've disproved that proverb.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.644
Aquinas, this bread is stubborn.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.109
Give me your knife.

04:42.241 --> 04:44.197
Scipio...

04:45.077 --> 04:48.114
you have a tolerant spirit.

04:48.247 --> 04:50.829
If you can, you should...

04:50.958 --> 04:53.700
— make peace with Caesar.
- I don't know about that.

04:53.836 --> 04:57.328
— I shall do whatever you do.
— I wouldn't do that.

04:58.466 --> 05:00.832
- Go your own way.
— Let's not discuss it now.

05:00.968 --> 05:04.381
There'll be plenty of time for such sad talk.

05:04.513 --> 05:07.630
If you'll excuse me. I need to urinate.

05:09.101 --> 05:11.717
There's a piss pot through there, I believe.

06:05.533 --> 06:08.070
Help!

06:40.401 --> 06:42.483
Send them away.

06:58.294 --> 07:00.410
Do it now.

07:03.757 --> 07:06.169
Cut deep, boy.

07:07.428 --> 07:09.419
Goodbye, sir.

08:18.207 --> 08:20.198
We thank you so much.

08:20.334 --> 08:23.121
We hope you have enjoyed
our humble efforts

08:23.253 --> 08:25.835
on this happy day!

08:28.008 --> 08:32.672
Happy day on which
our glorious father has returned!

08:32.805 --> 08:37.014
Happy day
on which the Julian sun has risen

08:37.142 --> 08:41.351
and banished Pompeyan night forever!

08:42.356 --> 08:46.019
Happy day on which our brave soldiers

08:47.027 --> 08:49.518
have come home to their families!

08:49.655 --> 08:51.816
Happy day!

08:57.413 --> 08:59.324
Happy day!

09:04.128 --> 09:06.414
- Salve.
— Welcome back.

09:31.155 --> 09:34.647
— Are you home for good now?
- I am.

09:34.783 --> 09:37.399
No more soldiering for me.

10:25.209 --> 10:27.450
It's nice, isn't it?

10:28.253 --> 10:30.118
It is.

10:32.216 --> 10:35.879
— Who are these?
— I bought them last year.

10:36.845 --> 10:40.633
— Four slaves we have now?
- They were a good price.

10:40.766 --> 10:43.052
On a soldier's wage?

10:44.436 --> 10:47.143
The butcher shop paid
for them with plenty to spare.

10:47.272 --> 10:48.648
The butcher shop?

10:48.774 --> 10:51.311
Me and Lyde have made
a nice business out of it.

10:51.443 --> 10:53.729
500 head a week sometimes.

10:53.862 --> 10:58.526
Pigs mostly, but some sheep
and cows for the religious trade.

11:13.048 --> 11:15.164
Eirene!

11:18.971 --> 11:21.508
— It's good to see you.
— And to see you, master.

11:21.640 --> 11:24.097
— You speak our words!
— If it pleases you.

11:24.226 --> 11:27.138
It does. Of course it does.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.935
- Can I get you anything?
— A bit of water would be nice.

11:48.584 --> 11:50.575
I brought you something.

11:58.594 --> 12:01.381
Here, let me.

12:08.562 --> 12:10.348
Lovely.

12:13.400 --> 12:16.392
"Parentalia begins on the ldes.

12:16.528 --> 12:20.487
"Temples will be shut
and no weddings celebrated.

12:20.616 --> 12:24.450
"Public festivals
shall be at the fifth hour in the Circus.

12:24.578 --> 12:27.285
"Wine to be provided
by the Capitoline fraternity,

12:27.414 --> 12:30.998
"and cakes by the Guild of Millers.

12:31.126 --> 12:34.118
"The Guild of Millers uses
only the finest grains.

12:34.254 --> 12:38.122
"True Roman bread, for true Romans."

12:44.765 --> 12:47.051
The fat old bitch herself...

12:47.935 --> 12:50.642
Must be good to be home.

12:50.771 --> 12:53.729
What is it, two years you've been gone?

12:55.108 --> 12:57.440
Are you still fucking my mother?

12:59.196 --> 13:04.065
— When she'll have me.
— That would explain your excessive familiarity.

13:04.201 --> 13:06.487
— Excuse me.
— That's all right.

13:06.620 --> 13:09.612
l was merely curious, and you're correct.

13:09.748 --> 13:12.160
It does feel good to be home.

13:28.392 --> 13:31.099
My darling boy.

13:35.190 --> 13:37.556
So handsome.

13:37.693 --> 13:40.651
— Sister, I hope you're well.
- Let me hug you.

13:43.949 --> 13:47.988
Come inside and wash.
Let's get rid of the stink of horse off you.

13:48.745 --> 13:51.862
Timon, I'll see you later.

13:58.046 --> 14:01.334
Please, Mother, we will be late.

14:01.466 --> 14:04.048
We must not be late. That would never do.

14:04.177 --> 14:07.044
I do not want to go to dinner
any more than you do,

14:07.180 --> 14:10.889
but Caesar has treated me
extremely well, and we must go if asked.

14:11.018 --> 14:13.179
— Honour demands...
— Honour?

14:15.230 --> 14:17.721
Not honour then, common sense.

14:17.858 --> 14:20.520
I cannot ask mercy of Caesar,

14:20.652 --> 14:24.065
accept rank and favour from him,
and then refuse his friendship.

14:24.197 --> 14:27.781
What sort of man asks
for mercy in the first place?

14:27.909 --> 14:30.491
I assure you, Mother,

14:30.620 --> 14:32.952
I am not proud of myself.

14:33.081 --> 14:35.493
I am not proud at all.

14:35.625 --> 14:37.581
In lieu of a noble suicide,

14:37.711 --> 14:40.043
you shall have to be content with that.

14:44.342 --> 14:46.549
Bring me my shawl.

14:46.678 --> 14:50.296
Please, do not come.
I shall make your excuses to Atia.

14:50.432 --> 14:52.969
Certainly not. I will go.

14:53.101 --> 14:56.059
Not to be there
would be seen as weakness.

15:06.573 --> 15:09.485
Perhaps it will do you good to see him.

15:09.618 --> 15:12.280
See that he is just a man.

15:12.996 --> 15:16.113
The loss of his affection is not worth

15:16.249 --> 15:18.080
this endless raging sorrow.

15:18.210 --> 15:20.576
| feel neither rage nor sorrow.

15:20.712 --> 15:24.079
My objection to Caesar is purely political,

15:25.217 --> 15:27.253
not personal.

15:28.762 --> 15:32.220
The Pontic troops ran so fast,
I don't know if they ever stopped.

15:32.349 --> 15:34.840
It is no wonder Pompey
took Pontus so readily.

15:34.976 --> 15:39.720
— A child with a stick might have done so.
- What next, sir? Germany, perhaps?

15:39.856 --> 15:42.893
I'm afraid I must put on
a triumph this next month,

15:43.026 --> 15:45.392
and they're damnable beasts to organise.

15:45.529 --> 15:48.987
Still, the people love a good parade.
We must not disappoint them.

15:49.116 --> 15:52.153
How lovely to see you both.

15:52.285 --> 15:55.197
— It's been far too long.
— We are joyful to be here.

15:55.330 --> 15:58.117
— Joyful, indeed.
— Is this a mourning shawl?

15:58.250 --> 16:00.992
It's very pretty. Has someone died?

16:01.128 --> 16:03.665
A great many have died.

16:03.797 --> 16:07.665
How true. But it's all over now,
and we're still alive.

16:07.801 --> 16:10.884
It's not possible. Octavian?

16:11.847 --> 16:16.011
Gods, you make me feel old.

16:17.769 --> 16:19.930
Come.

16:29.948 --> 16:33.566
It is the height of four men,
with a long neck like a goose,

16:33.702 --> 16:36.614
spots like a leopard,
and the speed of a horse.

16:36.746 --> 16:39.328
I don't believe it. A new Chimera.

16:39.457 --> 16:43.041
I assure you, it is real.
With any luck, you may see one at my triumph.

16:43.170 --> 16:46.879
l have been trying to bring one over
but the wretches keep dying.

16:47.007 --> 16:49.874
— They do not like the sea.
- It all sounds very tiring.

16:50.010 --> 16:54.629
After this infernal triumph is done
you must go to the country and relax.

16:54.764 --> 16:57.471
I should like that,
but then my work begins in earnest.

16:57.601 --> 16:59.933
I must begin putting the Republic to rights.

17:00.061 --> 17:03.724
Splendid notion.
How shall you proceed, do you suppose?

17:03.857 --> 17:07.315
l have a few ideas,
but I am open to suggestion.

17:07.444 --> 17:10.811
Yesterday,
I saw Malchio the baker in a litter.

17:10.947 --> 17:13.279
A baker! I'd put a stop to that sort of thing.

17:13.408 --> 17:16.070
I shall have it looked into. Octavian?

17:16.995 --> 17:19.327
How would you proceed, were you me?

17:20.248 --> 17:23.456
- Proceed with?
— Putting the Republic to rights.

17:25.629 --> 17:28.086
How to proceed.

17:28.215 --> 17:31.002
I would start a large programme
of public works.

17:31.134 --> 17:33.295
Employ citizens and free men,

17:33.428 --> 17:35.840
repair the aqueducts, levee the river.

17:35.972 --> 17:38.349
I would create at least 100 new senators,

17:38.475 --> 17:41.012
that were my creatures,
not my secret enemies.

17:41.144 --> 17:42.850
What is your point, Octavian?

17:42.979 --> 17:47.097
Not you, Brutus, you're a man of honour.
I believe your capitulation is sincere.

17:47.234 --> 17:50.442
— How nice of you to say so.
— ljust had a thought.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.687
Did not your man Aelius Siculus die recently?

17:53.823 --> 17:56.565
I'm afraid he did. In Thapsus, in fact.

17:56.701 --> 17:59.943
Just so. You shall take his seat
at the pontiff's table.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.116
Pontiff? So young?

18:02.249 --> 18:05.207
l was not so much older
when I entered the college.

18:05.335 --> 18:07.792
— True, but...
— I believe I have the authority

18:07.921 --> 18:09.786
— to appoint whom I like.
- Yes.

18:09.923 --> 18:12.414
This is a great honour.
Kiss your uncle's hand.

18:12.550 --> 18:15.087
| kiss your hand, Uncle, but I'd be an ill pontiff.

18:15.220 --> 18:17.381
Don't be ridiculous. You'll be a lovely pontiff.

18:17.514 --> 18:19.175
You'll see to it, right?

18:19.307 --> 18:21.969
I had rather thought
to concentrate on my poetry.

18:22.102 --> 18:24.844
— He'll make a lovely pontiff.
- Poetry can wait.

18:24.980 --> 18:27.062
It should not wait too long.

18:27.190 --> 18:31.900
Poetry is a young man's calling.
Don't you think?

18:43.623 --> 18:46.456
There's us with the walls
of Thapsus at our backs

18:46.584 --> 18:48.791
and your father was just here.

18:48.920 --> 18:53.789
Now, coming towards us on the plain
with all their legions, cavalry

18:53.925 --> 18:57.383
and 900 war elephants,

18:57.512 --> 18:59.468
Scipio and Juno.

18:59.597 --> 19:03.215
"Hold fast," says General Caesar.
"Let the bastards come!"

19:03.351 --> 19:05.216
- I'll do it.
— Don't, master.

19:05.353 --> 19:08.891
— This is my work. Lady will be angry.
— Who's master?

19:09.024 --> 19:13.438
..ballistas on the walls, so the front line
thinks they've been ordered to advance,

19:13.570 --> 19:17.859
so before the officers can stop it, the whole
fucking army charges on Scipio's men.

19:17.991 --> 19:22.325
Now, the elephants see us
come running and screaming

19:22.454 --> 19:25.287
and they turn tail and charge
on their own lines.

19:26.166 --> 19:27.781
Chaos!

19:28.918 --> 19:31.409
Don't cry, it was just a game.

19:34.174 --> 19:37.007
You must be bored,
sitting around here all day.

19:37.761 --> 19:40.252
- I don't mind.
— You've been discharged a month.

19:40.388 --> 19:42.253
I know.

19:43.350 --> 19:45.466
There's no hurry. We're all right for money...

19:45.602 --> 19:47.888
But I can't be loafing around here forever.

19:49.564 --> 19:53.022
— You don't like the butchering trade?
- Shopkeeping?

19:53.151 --> 19:56.359
It will give you something to do.

20:14.422 --> 20:17.004
This is fine work for a prefect...

20:17.133 --> 20:19.249
— Smells like old times.
- It does that.

20:19.386 --> 20:23.254
— Remember the siege at Avaricum?
— You'll not learn a trade on your pugas.

20:23.390 --> 20:26.757
There's plenty more carcasses to be hung.

20:26.893 --> 20:28.633
That's my boy.

20:39.406 --> 20:41.112
Tomorrow you'll have your money!

20:41.241 --> 20:43.277
Let's take his nose off.

20:43.410 --> 20:45.742
— Don't fuss.
- Stop that!

20:48.039 --> 20:50.872
— Take it elsewhere.
— What's it to you, you bastard?

20:51.000 --> 20:53.457
- It's bad for trade.
— And who the fuck are you?

20:53.586 --> 20:55.417
— I am Lucius Vorenus.
- I know you.

20:55.547 --> 20:59.290
Soldier boy, isn't it?
Up by the dye works, tasty wife.

20:59.426 --> 21:02.634
Do not speak of my wife.
Get gone. That's an order.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.548
No, no. Orders? No.

21:04.681 --> 21:08.594
You're not a soldier now.
You're a fucking shopkeeper's clerk.

21:12.355 --> 21:14.971
— You're dead, you are.
— Walk away now

21:15.108 --> 21:18.225
and do not let me see you on this street again.

21:19.571 --> 21:22.688
Both of you. Dead.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.622
Get back to your business.

21:37.672 --> 21:41.506
You shouldn't have done that.
Those were Erastes Fulmen's people.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.590
He won't take disrespect like that.

21:43.720 --> 21:47.133
- You hit him.
— It was nothing.

21:47.265 --> 21:50.007
Erastes Fulmen will kill you.

21:50.143 --> 21:52.976
— He's just a crook.
- He used to be.

21:53.104 --> 21:57.313
Since Pompey's gangs left, he's had
the run of the hill. He's a big man now.

21:57.442 --> 22:00.855
— He kills whoever he wants!
- I'm no prole to be abused!

22:00.987 --> 22:03.820
l was prefect in the evocati!

22:03.948 --> 22:06.155
Caesar himself gave me a horse.

22:18.213 --> 22:19.293
Thank you, sir.

22:31.559 --> 22:35.017
I hope that dinner was
not too painful for you.

22:35.772 --> 22:39.356
I'm used to pain. I don't mind it.

22:45.865 --> 22:48.151
| wish you didn't care for him so much.

22:50.370 --> 22:53.112
| wish I didn't care for you so much.

22:53.831 --> 22:56.288
Stop.

23:12.475 --> 23:16.218
That brother of yours
has become quite the pretty man.

23:16.354 --> 23:20.222
— Caesar seems very fond of him.
- Very much.

23:21.859 --> 23:25.568
— Mother claims Caesar took him for a lover.
— Really?

23:25.697 --> 23:29.030
The cook said she heard them
going at it in a closet.

23:29.158 --> 23:31.444
Octavian insisted it was not so.

23:31.578 --> 23:35.321
He said the noises she heard
were some terrible affliction of Caesar's.

23:35.456 --> 23:38.038
Mother wouldn't have it.
Once she gets an idea...

23:38.167 --> 23:39.998
Affliction? What affliction?

23:41.713 --> 23:44.079
— I don't know.
— Did he not say?

23:44.215 --> 23:46.592
He was sworn to secrecy.

23:46.718 --> 23:49.425
But he said terrible? He said terrible affliction?

23:51.097 --> 23:54.305
You must find out exactly
what this affliction is.

23:54.434 --> 23:58.473
— Find out which god has cursed him.
— How can I do that? It's a secret.

23:58.605 --> 24:01.312
You must find it out.
This is the weapon I seek.

24:01.441 --> 24:03.898
With the gods' help, I can destroy him.

24:04.027 --> 24:07.019
— Don't talk this way.
— Would you rather I lied to you?

24:07.155 --> 24:11.444
I would rather you think of something
other than the destruction of my uncle.

24:14.287 --> 24:19.247
l have never lied to you.
He still has some terrible hold over me.

24:19.375 --> 24:23.789
| wish it were not so, but he will not let go.

24:24.464 --> 24:26.580
Will you ask your brother?

24:30.970 --> 24:34.428
— Would that make you happy?
— Yes, it would.

24:39.646 --> 24:41.932
What are you reading?

24:43.107 --> 24:45.769
A guide to the interpretation of prodigies.

24:45.902 --> 24:50.191
— Is it good?
— lt's dull beyond conception.

24:50.323 --> 24:53.861
To be a pontiff,
I must be familiar with their ludicrous jargon.

24:53.993 --> 24:56.780
Mustn't let down Uncle.

24:58.456 --> 25:00.868
I'm bored.

25:02.835 --> 25:05.542
— I could read to you.
- If you like.

25:07.006 --> 25:09.383
"Little sparrow, my lover's love,

25:09.509 --> 25:13.252
"with whom she plays,
permits to lie within her lap,

25:13.388 --> 25:16.721
"to nip her finger,
biting quickly with that bill,

25:16.849 --> 25:22.094
"I should like to play with you as she
and soothe my troubled heart."

25:22.230 --> 25:24.972
— Very nice.
— You do not like it?

25:25.108 --> 25:27.474
No, you recite well, but...

25:27.610 --> 25:29.976
I'm tired of poetry.

25:33.908 --> 25:36.524
— Tell me a secret.
- A secret?

25:36.661 --> 25:39.152
A shocking and dangerous one
that nobody knows.

25:39.288 --> 25:41.449
I don't know any secrets like that.

25:46.963 --> 25:49.045
I know.

25:52.009 --> 25:55.297
What about Caesar
and his mysterious affliction?

25:58.766 --> 26:02.054
- What affliction?
— Don't lie. The one you told Mother about.

26:02.812 --> 26:05.929
It was nothing. lwas just making it up.

26:06.065 --> 26:08.772
— So you were lovers?
— Of course not.

26:08.901 --> 26:12.519
Either you were lovers, or some god
has cursed Caesar, which is it?

26:12.655 --> 26:15.112
— Sister, there are no gods.
- Don't be horrid.

26:15.241 --> 26:18.779
There is doubtless
a prime mover of some sort,

26:18.911 --> 26:22.119
but beings that look like us
and meddle in our affairs?

26:22.248 --> 26:24.614
- Highly improbable.
— You don't trust me.

26:24.751 --> 26:27.788
— I do trust you. You are my dearest friend.
- Then tell me!

26:27.920 --> 26:31.253
Why this? What do you care
if Caesar has an affliction?

26:31.924 --> 26:34.040
I don't care the slightest bit.

26:34.177 --> 26:37.214
Only that it would be a terrible secret
and worth hearing.

26:37.346 --> 26:43.842
And I doubt very much that you have
any terrible secrets of your own worth telling.

26:43.978 --> 26:46.219
- You'd be wrong.
— Please, like what?

26:51.110 --> 26:53.601
— l've tortured and killed a man.
- Liar.

26:53.738 --> 26:58.277
Do you remember Lucius Vorenus?
One of the soldiers who rescued me in Gaul?

26:58.409 --> 27:00.070
— You killed him?
- Of course not.

27:00.203 --> 27:02.034
He has a wife who deceived him.

27:02.163 --> 27:04.905
A child he thinks
is his daughter's son is in fact

27:05.041 --> 27:07.999
his wife's child
by a low half—Greek butcher.

27:08.127 --> 27:09.833
How sordid.

27:09.962 --> 27:14.547
It was the butcher I killed. Helped kill, anyway.

27:16.761 --> 27:18.968
Bravo, I suppose.

27:19.347 --> 27:21.963
You asked for a terrible secret.

27:34.695 --> 27:36.777
Try again.

27:44.789 --> 27:47.371
— What?
— Get out of the way!

27:47.500 --> 27:51.368
Centurion!

27:52.880 --> 27:54.996
Lucius Vorenus!

27:57.051 --> 27:59.383
Lucius Vorenus!

28:03.850 --> 28:08.219
Niobe, looking as lovely as ever.

28:08.354 --> 28:10.390
Phyllis sends her best regards.

28:16.612 --> 28:18.227
Very pretty family you have.

28:19.448 --> 28:22.064
It's good to see you again after so long.

28:22.952 --> 28:26.661
So, back from the wars.

28:26.789 --> 28:29.747
Civilian life... Must be hard to adjust.

28:29.876 --> 28:32.583
Different rules.

28:32.712 --> 28:34.828
Different fucking rules!

28:38.175 --> 28:40.962
My man Urbo here says
you slapped him in the face.

28:41.095 --> 28:43.302
— Did you do that?
— I did.

28:43.431 --> 28:46.218
Perfect example. Different rules.

28:47.059 --> 28:50.472
You see, I'm allowed to chastise my people.

28:54.984 --> 28:58.101
Regular citizens like you
are not allowed to touch them.

28:58.237 --> 29:02.355
If someone does touch them,
they have to be punished. Rules.

29:02.491 --> 29:04.231
Get to your point.

29:04.368 --> 29:09.829
This is the second time that
Lucius Vorenus has shown me disrespect.

29:10.499 --> 29:15.914
Next market day at noon,
he will find me in the Forum.

29:16.047 --> 29:18.333
He will kneel down before me.

29:18.466 --> 29:22.209
He will kiss my feet
and he will apologise to me.

29:23.596 --> 29:26.303
If he does not do this,
I will come here and kill him.

29:27.767 --> 29:32.136
But before he dies,
he will see his wife and daughters raped.

29:32.271 --> 29:34.728
And then I will burn down this building.

29:34.857 --> 29:36.688
Hold.

29:39.445 --> 29:41.185
— You've said your piece?
— l have.

29:41.322 --> 29:44.439
Then leave now.

29:44.575 --> 29:46.611
Good day to you.

29:59.131 --> 30:02.339
So the wife of this Lucius Vorenus is a whore.
What's that to me?

30:02.468 --> 30:05.335
I'm sorry, that's all he told me.

30:05.471 --> 30:08.133
— He swears Caesar has no affliction.
— He's lying.

30:08.265 --> 30:11.302
Is it not enough, then?
If Caesar has an affliction,

30:11.435 --> 30:14.347
he has it and suffers,
whether you know it or not.

30:14.480 --> 30:19.770
He suffers, but he is not destroyed.
You must get the truth from your brother.

30:19.902 --> 30:23.110
— How? I tried.
- Try again.

30:23.239 --> 30:25.321
Promise him something.

30:26.659 --> 30:28.820
You do have something he wants.

30:34.083 --> 30:36.916
A young man will tell his lover anything.

30:42.008 --> 30:43.794
You can't be serious.

30:44.468 --> 30:46.504
How can you...?

30:49.348 --> 30:50.724
You know he wants you.

30:50.850 --> 30:54.513
I would be betraying my brother.
I would be betraying my family.

30:54.645 --> 30:59.184
Your family is a nest of snakes.
You have no obligations to them.

30:59.316 --> 31:01.693
They are my family! They love me...

31:01.819 --> 31:05.858
— As I love you.
— You call this love?

31:08.701 --> 31:10.737
- I can't.
— Where are you going?

31:10.870 --> 31:13.031
— Home.
— Don't go.

31:13.164 --> 31:14.950
Your mother killed Glabius!

31:18.836 --> 31:22.704
My people caught one of the men that did it.
One of Timon's men.

31:36.937 --> 31:39.064
I'm sorry.

32:20.356 --> 32:22.938
— Do as Lyde says.
— Mama, come with us.

32:23.067 --> 32:26.480
— My place is here with your father.
- But what if you're killed?

32:26.612 --> 32:30.230
Then you must stay in the country,
don't come back to the city.

32:30.366 --> 32:33.153
You understand? Don't come back!

32:33.285 --> 32:35.276
You'll be country girls.

32:35.955 --> 32:40.449
Your cousin will find you
good handsome farmers to marry.

32:45.297 --> 32:47.629
Go ask the gods for blessing.

32:51.637 --> 32:53.878
Can't you get Vorenus to do as Erastes asks?

32:54.014 --> 32:57.472
— If you begged him...
— To kiss a man's feet?

32:57.601 --> 33:00.889
I'd never ask such a thing,
and he'd never agree to it.

33:01.021 --> 33:05.230
Always remember that you are children
of the Voreni, an old and respected name.

33:05.359 --> 33:07.850
And always remember that we love you.

33:07.987 --> 33:11.195
I love you very much. Now go on.

33:23.085 --> 33:24.746
Go.

33:28.424 --> 33:29.504
Goodbye, sister.

33:44.690 --> 33:48.899
Eirene, are you going
to leave this mess on the table?

33:50.154 --> 33:51.985
Please, Niobe, please, go with them.

33:52.114 --> 33:54.196
I will not, and stop asking.

35:01.100 --> 35:04.342
- Good bread, this.
— I bought the better kind.

35:05.854 --> 35:07.936
Hang the expense?

35:18.701 --> 35:20.908
Get back. Make way.

35:21.036 --> 35:22.742
Run and hide.

35:28.544 --> 35:33.959
Here comes the Consul Gaius Julius Caesar,
Son of Venus, lmperator of the Gallic Legions.

35:36.593 --> 35:38.504
Salve, Lucius Vorenus.

36:12.087 --> 36:15.921
— Your wife is very beautiful. Her name?
— Niobe, sir.

36:20.763 --> 36:23.254
Rise, Niobe.

36:27.978 --> 36:30.094
Would you honour us by drinking our water?

36:30.230 --> 36:32.721
I'm happy to do so.

36:32.858 --> 36:34.439
Please, sit.

36:38.530 --> 36:40.942
l have always held you in high regard,
Vorenus,

36:41.075 --> 36:44.863
and I am told you are a man of respect
among your people here.

36:44.995 --> 36:47.907
— I hope so.
— That being so, I am come to ask you

36:48.040 --> 36:52.955
to stand for magistrate of Lower Aventine,
on my slate.

36:53.629 --> 36:56.166
Thank you.

36:57.424 --> 37:00.086
Well?

37:03.472 --> 37:07.431
I am deeply honoured by your presence here,
sir, deeply honoured.

37:07.559 --> 37:10.926
But respectfully, I must decline.

37:11.063 --> 37:14.396
So you still disapprove of my actions?

37:14.525 --> 37:18.438
Sir, with respect, your politics are not mine.

37:18.570 --> 37:19.946
I am aware of that.

37:20.072 --> 37:21.903
As a magistrate, I would have to speak.

37:22.032 --> 37:26.776
And you will not speak in favour of a tyrant?

37:26.912 --> 37:30.700
— I will not speak against my beliefs.
— Delicious.

37:31.667 --> 37:33.828
You misjudge me. I am no tyrant.

37:33.961 --> 37:36.623
l have taken dictator's powers legally.

37:36.755 --> 37:40.794
And I will return those powers to the
people and the senate as soon as I am able.

37:40.926 --> 37:45.135
I will not rest until Rome
is as it was in the golden age.

37:46.181 --> 37:49.344
I cannot succeed alone. Will you join me?

38:06.493 --> 38:09.200
Hail Caesar! Hail!

38:39.985 --> 38:42.101
A little more, I think.

38:42.237 --> 38:45.729
No, the sleeves are fine, leave those alone.

38:45.866 --> 38:48.699
You just be careful what
you're doing with that pin.

38:48.827 --> 38:52.115
Yes. Now, if you could go around the side,
at the hem, at the bottom,

38:52.247 --> 38:54.909
that needs taking up a little bit there.

38:55.042 --> 38:57.579
There. No, that's fine.

38:57.711 --> 39:00.828
I don't know. That just isn't working for me.

39:16.522 --> 39:19.229
Were you looking for anything in particular?

39:20.317 --> 39:22.182
Not really.

39:37.125 --> 39:40.834
— Do you have anything comical?
- I don't think so.

39:48.011 --> 39:49.262
You.

39:52.933 --> 39:56.721
— Why send him away? It's hot.
— I don't like that one. He looks at me.

39:57.312 --> 40:00.679
— Does he? Have Castor beat him.
- Maybe I will.

40:03.652 --> 40:06.985
— I'll call for another one.
— Don't.

40:07.114 --> 40:09.571
It's nice to be alone.

40:11.577 --> 40:13.363
Isn't it?

40:14.663 --> 40:17.746
—|suppose.
— Come lie down with me.

40:18.750 --> 40:21.492
Lie down with you? Why?

40:23.046 --> 40:26.459
— I would like it.
- Why?

40:26.592 --> 40:29.504
- Why not?
— I can think of several reasons.

40:29.636 --> 40:33.379
When you were little,
you would come to my bed every night.

40:33.515 --> 40:35.972
Not every night. Only when l was scared.

40:36.101 --> 40:39.059
— You were scared a great deal.
— I'm not scared now.

40:47.279 --> 40:50.191
— Pretend.
— l have no skill at pretending.

40:57.456 --> 40:59.538
l'm embarrassed now.

41:00.792 --> 41:02.999
I thought you wanted me.

41:08.675 --> 41:10.757
You're a man now, aren't you?

41:13.847 --> 41:16.133
You can take what you want.

42:12.698 --> 42:14.939
Brother, tell me something...

42:18.537 --> 42:20.619
What do you mean, "Ah"?

42:22.040 --> 42:24.122
Now comes the price.

42:26.920 --> 42:29.002
— What?
— You're a virtuous woman.

42:29.131 --> 42:31.747
You must know seducing
your own brother is wrong.

42:31.883 --> 42:35.671
You and l are above
such petty social convention.

42:35.804 --> 42:39.422
lncest is not merely wrong by convention.
lt's wrong in essence.

42:40.142 --> 42:44.431
It must be, else why so many idiots and
monsters among the children of incest?

42:44.563 --> 42:47.771
— Don't.
— Don't worry.

42:47.899 --> 42:52.188
It's unlikely I've seeded you.
Not with the moon in transit.

42:52.320 --> 42:56.984
The point is, you wouldn't do such wrong out
of mere lust. You must have another purpose.

42:57.117 --> 43:01.076
I suspect you shall renew your
strange interest in Caesar's health.

43:05.250 --> 43:08.583
What have I done?

43:11.631 --> 43:14.008
What have I done? What?

43:17.429 --> 43:20.921
What have you done? Tell me.

43:23.769 --> 43:25.555
Promise.

43:25.687 --> 43:27.928
Promise you won't tell Mother.

43:44.581 --> 43:46.242
Look at you.

43:46.374 --> 43:48.626
You look like laundry.

43:52.798 --> 43:54.959
There.

43:55.091 --> 43:57.628
— Does it look well?
— Very well.

43:57.761 --> 44:00.343
It feels strange.

44:00.472 --> 44:03.464
No, don't, you'll dirty it.

44:03.600 --> 44:07.263
Does it hang properly at the back?

44:07.395 --> 44:09.477
I think so.

44:33.839 --> 44:37.878
- Calm down, Mother, really.
— l have not even begun to get angry!

44:40.720 --> 44:44.633
Enough! I am your son but not your child.

44:44.766 --> 44:47.849
— You will not strike me any more.
- Will I not?

44:48.603 --> 44:51.060
You fucked your sister, you little pervert!

44:51.189 --> 44:53.601
Don't tell me what I will and will not do!

44:53.733 --> 44:56.190
- Be quiet!
— You wouldn't dare.

45:10.584 --> 45:13.041
How could you do this to me?

45:13.879 --> 45:16.586
— My own child.
— You killed my husband.

45:16.715 --> 45:20.708
— I told you. I told you I didn't kill him!
— You're a liar.

45:20.844 --> 45:23.551
Servilia caught one of the men that did it.

45:23.680 --> 45:26.092
- One of Timon's men.
— And where is this man?

45:26.224 --> 45:28.601
Did you speak to him?

45:28.727 --> 45:31.013
Look at me!

45:32.314 --> 45:35.306
I swear on the spirits of my ancestors,

45:35.442 --> 45:39.435
on the stone of Jupiter,
I did not kill your husband!

45:39.571 --> 45:41.812
You abased yourself for a stupid lie!

45:44.576 --> 45:47.534
- I don't know.
— Servilia is the liar, you fool!

45:47.662 --> 45:49.778
She lied to turn you against me.

46:01.051 --> 46:03.133
My poor lamb.

46:30.080 --> 46:31.115
Eirene?

46:44.844 --> 46:45.879
Coming, master.

46:52.727 --> 46:54.979
Sit down. Have a drink with me.

47:15.750 --> 47:17.490
My mother had hair like yours.

47:20.880 --> 47:22.871
Grey eyes, though.

47:23.008 --> 47:25.420
Big grey eyes.

47:28.596 --> 47:31.884
Slave...on one of those farms up north.

47:33.768 --> 47:37.932
Smelled of pine trees.
Worked in the wood yards, probably.

47:38.815 --> 47:41.227
That's what I think. Explains the pine smell.

47:46.156 --> 47:49.899
Don't know who my father was.
Just another slave, probably.

47:52.829 --> 47:56.117
Some timid cunt shovelling shit
with a collar round his neck

47:56.249 --> 47:58.490
who didn't have
the courage to die like a man.

47:58.626 --> 48:01.242
l'd cut my fucking heart out
of my chest and eat it

48:01.379 --> 48:03.836
before I knelt down to anybody!

48:03.965 --> 48:05.580
— Cunt!
— Quiet!

48:05.717 --> 48:07.673
Keep it down!

48:07.802 --> 48:09.793
Suck my cock, the lot of yous!

48:09.929 --> 48:12.056
l'm Titus Pullo, right?

48:18.897 --> 48:20.478
Right?

48:21.900 --> 48:23.731
Right, master.

48:25.236 --> 48:27.318
You're a good girl.

48:29.866 --> 48:32.232
You don't smile much, though.

48:33.578 --> 48:35.785
You want me to smile?

48:35.914 --> 48:38.451
I want you to be happy.

48:42.921 --> 48:44.957
That's better.

48:46.424 --> 48:48.631
Have some wine.

48:59.771 --> 49:01.762
Come here.

49:17.455 --> 49:19.571
Closer.

49:27.715 --> 49:29.171
Take off your dress.

50:28.693 --> 50:31.560
— What's the hat for?
- Yom Kippur.

50:31.696 --> 50:35.063
— Is that today?
— You call yourself a Jew?

50:35.200 --> 50:37.031
What, are you my Rebbe now?

50:47.212 --> 50:48.622
Move!

50:53.927 --> 50:55.463
No!

50:56.554 --> 50:58.215
Quick, grab her!

50:58.973 --> 51:02.716
— Strip her!
— No!

51:04.771 --> 51:07.387
Somebody help her!

51:12.278 --> 51:15.361
Goddess protect me.

51:15.490 --> 51:17.196
My goddess will protect me.

51:20.954 --> 51:24.367
My goddess...keep and protect me...

51:24.499 --> 51:26.455
No!

51:26.584 --> 51:28.324
Let's go!
