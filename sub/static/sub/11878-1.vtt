02:11.271 --> 02:12.271
Shh. Shh.

02:14.250 --> 02:15.936
Is Toby dead?

02:16.764 --> 02:18.202
They're all dead.

02:22.836 --> 02:23.836
Sally, Sally,
Sally.

02:23.838 --> 02:25.349
Look at me.
Look at me.

02:25.890 --> 02:28.270
Keep it down, or we're next.

02:28.272 --> 02:29.272
Shh, shh, shh.

02:30.020 --> 02:32.990
It's okay.  It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.  Sh.  Sh.

02:33.610 --> 02:34.610
Quiet, please.

02:35.032 --> 02:36.679
Sally, shh.  Shh.

02:36.790 --> 02:38.445
It'll be fine.

02:39.250 --> 02:41.650
Okay, Sally, okay.
It'll be fine.

02:41.690 --> 02:43.479
I'm going to
go find a weapon.

02:43.481 --> 02:46.204
Oh, no, we just need to wait!
I'm not going anywhere.

02:46.551 --> 02:47.551
Shh. Shh.  Shh.

02:48.171 --> 02:51.290
Here, I'll hold your hand
the entire time, okay?

02:51.293 --> 02:53.086
...The entire time.
- Don't do it.

02:54.796 --> 02:57.700
We can do this, huh?
We've got to protect ourselves.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.690
We are gonna
get the fuck outta here.

03:01.397 --> 03:04.256
You gotta let me do this.
Just gonna have a look, okay?

03:04.875 --> 03:06.416
Stay.
Please, stay.

03:18.306 --> 03:21.480
I think I found a way out.
- Really?

05:52.650 --> 05:55.230
Let's go on a road trip somewhere
and get out of this shithole.

05:55.625 --> 05:56.700
Sounds good to me.

05:56.750 --> 05:58.831
But I ain't goin' nowhere
with just you two.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.144
I could call Melanie
and see what she's up to.

06:01.146 --> 06:02.576
I know she
doesn't have to work.

06:02.600 --> 06:04.317
Where are you guys
gonna take us this time?

06:04.675 --> 06:06.045
Let's go to the beach.

06:06.125 --> 06:07.496
Oh, we do that all the time.

06:07.827 --> 06:09.027
It's time we go inland.

06:09.105 --> 06:11.318
We can go like horse riding
and all that country shit.

06:11.320 --> 06:14.124
Yeah, that sounds like fun and
Mel would be totally down with  that.

06:14.126 --> 06:15.021
There you go, mate.

06:15.023 --> 06:16.415
What's pissed-off something in you
for a change?

06:16.417 --> 06:19.774
Alright, done.   Nat, call Mel,
see if she wants to come, then.

06:19.940 --> 06:22.352
But we're not sleeping in the same tent
as Donkey dick over here.

06:22.400 --> 06:25.200
Oh, come on mate,
your mama loved it.

06:25.300 --> 06:28.916
Alright, lovebirds, I'm gonna call  Mel.
You guys figure out where we're going.

06:30.137 --> 06:31.860
Hey, dude.

06:32.919 --> 06:34.411
I might have an idea
where we can go.

06:34.647 --> 06:35.855
Oh yeah,
where abouts?

06:36.155 --> 06:38.637
You know how you've always wanted
to stay in a haunted house, somewhere?

06:39.148 --> 06:40.528
Yeah, what about it?

06:40.751 --> 06:43.775
Right near Mitchell
is a place called Charlie's farm.

06:43.800 --> 06:45.801
They say that the family
that lived there in the 80s,

06:45.803 --> 06:47.203
was murdered by the locals.

06:47.250 --> 06:48.597
Keep talkin'.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.517
Apparently this place
is like a 100,000 acres

06:50.617 --> 06:51.817
in the middle of nowhere.

06:51.875 --> 06:53.431
I reckon we can get some
camping gear together

06:53.433 --> 06:54.687
and head out for a look-see.

06:54.700 --> 06:57.053
So, you want to go
and camp on this Charlie's farm?

06:57.060 --> 06:58.373
Yeah, it will be fun.

06:59.106 --> 07:02.900
Alright, I'm game. But not
a word of this to the girls, okay?

07:03.000 --> 07:04.303
We'll just have to tell them
when we get there.

07:04.400 --> 07:05.482
- I'm cool with that.
- Yeah.

07:06.418 --> 07:07.418
Hey, Nat,

07:07.584 --> 07:08.584
Natasha.

07:08.641 --> 07:09.906
Hold on...
Where are we going?

07:09.908 --> 07:11.608
Tell her we're
goin' out west, ah,

07:11.610 --> 07:13.682
horse riding and fishing.
- Did you hear all that?

07:13.700 --> 07:15.630
I think Donkey  used to have
a ranch out there.

07:15.631 --> 07:18.014
That's a farm, Nat,
You're in Australia now.

07:18.100 --> 07:19.430
Who cares?
It's all the same.

07:19.550 --> 07:21.900
- So, is she comin' ?
- Yeah, she's coming.

07:22.245 --> 07:23.120
Boom!

07:23.122 --> 07:25.164
Let me ask him--
Jason, when are we going?

07:25.165 --> 07:27.661
Ah, let's leave here by
6 tomorrow morning.

07:27.665 --> 07:29.908
Alright, so just come here
at 6:00 in the morning

07:29.910 --> 07:31.110
and we'll all leave together.

07:31.211 --> 07:32.211
Sounds good to me,
alright, mate.

07:32.213 --> 07:33.888
Should give us plenty of time
for the eight hour drive.

07:33.934 --> 07:36.100
Yeah, just come to my house.
- Bring some warm clothes.

07:36.125 --> 07:37.470
And don't forget,
bring warm clothes,

07:37.470 --> 07:39.370
because it is
going to be really cold.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.500
- I'll keep her warm.
- Yeah,  sure you will.

07:41.871 --> 07:44.696
- In your own tent.
- Hey, that's the plan.

07:44.900 --> 07:46.361
Well, I'm heading off
to get my camping gear.

07:46.363 --> 07:47.363
Alright, mate, help yourself.

07:47.365 --> 07:49.065
- See you at 6, eh?
- Yeah.  Fare', mate.

08:15.700 --> 08:16.957
Hey boys.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.480
Hey, let me
get that for you.

08:18.642 --> 08:19.642
Thanks.

08:19.790 --> 08:21.462
-Hey.
- Hey.

08:22.698 --> 08:26.619
Hey, Mick, I have to ask,
Why do they call you 'Donkey' ?

08:27.767 --> 08:29.000
Are you for real?

08:29.564 --> 08:32.902
Honey, is she for real?
- Why?  What's up?

08:33.000 --> 08:34.400
Why do they
call him 'Donkey' ?

08:36.597 --> 08:38.721
Oh...   OH!

08:39.500 --> 08:41.111
He can nearly put that thing
in his own mouth.

08:41.113 --> 08:42.775
Mate, if I could, I would.

08:42.950 --> 08:45.422
- You're so sick.
- Yeah, that--that is a little bit sick.

08:45.424 --> 08:46.424
Come on.

08:47.225 --> 08:49.025
Well, boom!  Boom , boom, boom!

08:49.067 --> 08:51.044
Just hurry up and
give me a hand will you?

08:51.750 --> 08:53.854
So, who
am I sleeping with?

08:53.856 --> 08:55.456
Mel, you're such
a slut.

08:55.500 --> 08:57.260
I meant,
whose tent am I in.

08:57.262 --> 08:58.558
Mel, you're
sleeping with Mick.

08:58.560 --> 08:59.660
Sweet!

08:59.779 --> 09:02.408
Another question,
why are we going out west?

09:02.410 --> 09:04.000
Oh, well there's this cool place that I--

09:04.001 --> 09:05.660
...that actually has horse riding,
fishing and camping.

09:05.665 --> 09:08.163
But, ah, there's not going to be
any  mobile phone coverage,

09:08.165 --> 09:09.165
so no Facebook.

09:09.167 --> 09:11.467
Just ah, beautiful,
fresh country air to breathe in.

09:11.500 --> 09:13.790
What do you mean no Facebook?
I have fans you know.

09:13.791 --> 09:15.381
I know.
I am one.

09:15.400 --> 09:17.733
Well, I'm sure your fans can
hold off for a few days.

09:18.994 --> 09:21.068
Dude, what are you doing?
I told you not to say anything.

09:21.070 --> 09:23.931
I wasn't gonna, man. I was gonna
make up a big story for 'em.

09:23.933 --> 09:26.533
That's exactly why I cut you off.
Just think, okay?

09:26.900 --> 09:29.897
Alright, let's do this.

10:20.550 --> 10:22.592
Hey Jason, how much further
before we get there?

10:23.300 --> 10:26.340
- I don't know.  Maybe two hours?
- You said it was gonna be eight hours.

10:26.350 --> 10:28.792
Nat, we've been stopping every hour.
We'll stop soon.

10:28.798 --> 10:31.204
I say we make a stop soon mate,
and stay there.

10:31.229 --> 10:32.798
We can head
into Mitchell, tomorrow.

10:32.823 --> 10:33.836
Are you guys cool with that?

10:34.078 --> 10:36.578
Yeah, I'm cool.  Well we're camping,
so anywhere's good with me.

10:36.601 --> 10:37.934
I'm starving.

10:38.110 --> 10:39.509
Actually, me too brother.

10:39.747 --> 10:42.109
Let's get a stretch and a bite to eat,
then I can drive for a while.

10:42.210 --> 10:45.093
It sounds good.  Alright, let's pull up
for the night and get a place here.

10:49.501 --> 10:50.900
Are you sure it's left?

10:50.910 --> 10:54.000
Yeah, it's left. It's  left!!
- Are you sure?

10:54.100 --> 10:56.709
What did the sign say?
- It said, this way.

10:56.840 --> 10:58.640
It's left, you're right it's left.

10:58.700 --> 11:00.520
It did.
We're goin' to Tulaca.

11:00.700 --> 11:03.158
We driven for 5  hours
and  I'm starving.

11:03.428 --> 11:04.728
Don't shout at the beans
if you're wrong.

11:04.744 --> 11:06.044
If you're wrong,
then it's beans

11:06.110 --> 11:07.588
If you're wrong,
you're buying 'em.

11:16.900 --> 11:18.100
How you goin' ?

11:18.210 --> 11:20.341
How are you goin' ?

11:21.100 --> 11:23.400
Hello, there you go.

11:27.189 --> 11:28.189
<i>Oh, my God...</i>

11:28.190 --> 11:31.032
Have you ever heard of a place
called Charlie's farm?

11:36.000 --> 11:39.795
And do you realize like, he talks
to everyone in the bar?   - He's  Donkey.

11:39.998 --> 11:41.298
How you goin' mate?

11:41.800 --> 11:44.600
Have you girls ever heard
of a place called Charlie's farm?

11:44.610 --> 11:47.500
Who does that?
- That's a little creepy.

11:55.610 --> 11:57.428
Oh yeah, thanks for
getting us a beer.

11:57.430 --> 11:58.932
I came without one, sorry.

11:59.710 --> 12:03.100
You think alcohol is no good for you?
- It's just a beer mate.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.600
- So, Blue is it?
- That's right.

12:20.800 --> 12:24.100
- Can I ask you a question?
- Shoot.

12:24.800 --> 12:27.200
How long have you lived down here?
- Born and bred.

12:27.300 --> 12:29.700
<i>He knows the Outback
through and through.</i>

12:29.710 --> 12:33.550
<i>Scared of the big city, aren't you Bluey?</i>
- Piss off Jaeger.

12:33.900 --> 12:38.400
I went there once.
Too many people there for me.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.600
Sir, you know
that Charlie's farm?

12:43.200 --> 12:45.300
Did you guys
like your meals?

12:47.100 --> 12:50.190
You're lot not thinking
of going out there, are you?

12:50.200 --> 12:52.304
Yeah, for sure.   What can you
tell me about the place?

12:52.306 --> 12:55.128
Nothing!
Stay away from there, son.

12:55.310 --> 12:58.318
You and all your friends
better just hop back in your car

12:58.675 --> 13:01.139
and piss-off
back where you came from.

13:01.738 --> 13:03.103
What's Charlie's farm?

13:03.105 --> 13:06.405
Girlie,  you don't want to know
about Charlie's farm.

13:06.417 --> 13:09.977
The best thing you can do
is go home.

13:11.200 --> 13:13.550
Jason, what's Charlie's farm?
- I have no idea.

13:14.067 --> 13:16.164
Hey, is it true people
still go missing out that way?

13:16.166 --> 13:18.366
Mate, more than you know,
have been for years.

13:18.400 --> 13:21.200
That's just a bullshit story.
Who wants another round?

13:21.300 --> 13:22.830
Not for this four.

13:22.900 --> 13:25.839
You're gonna take your friends home,
aren't you son?

13:25.990 --> 13:26.985
Well. I'd like another beer.

13:26.987 --> 13:28.720
No, you don't, mate.
 Let's go.  You've had enough.

13:28.846 --> 13:30.086
Girls, let's go.

13:31.810 --> 13:33.250
Off you go.

13:34.100 --> 13:36.300
Fucking wankers.
<i>- Mate, relax..</i>

13:36.310 --> 13:38.800
Oh, come on, that's bullshit.
- I'm sorry... sorry.

13:46.362 --> 13:47.662
Oh, fuck me!

13:48.000 --> 13:49.207
Okay, what just
happened in there?

13:49.209 --> 13:50.909
Can someone just tell  me
what the hell's going on?

13:50.910 --> 13:52.700
Yeah, you mentioned a farm and
everyone went all weird.

13:52.710 --> 13:54.500
- I'm lost.
- Yeah, me too.

13:54.510 --> 13:56.781
What is Charlie's farm
and why do you guys want to go there?

13:56.783 --> 13:59.169
Wait, stop stressing.
Okay, let's find somewhere to sleep

13:59.171 --> 14:00.771
and we'll talk about it then.
Let's go on,

14:00.810 --> 14:03.447
Yeah, let's go and hit the road
before Blue shoots me or something.

14:03.449 --> 14:04.803
Bloody, grumpy old prick.

14:04.874 --> 14:05.874
Oi.

14:06.683 --> 14:08.900
It's not grumpy.
He was there.

14:09.507 --> 14:11.700
And he knows more than
he'd like to know.

14:12.566 --> 14:16.600
Look, guys-- there's better places
to visit than Charlie's farm.   Let it go.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.899
So he was actually there
when it all happened?

14:18.901 --> 14:20.601
 Yes, weren't you listening?

14:20.693 --> 14:22.236
Holy shit, this is wild!

14:22.418 --> 14:24.935
Who's he?
What are you guys talking about?

14:24.951 --> 14:27.885
Look, love, I've had a long chat
to your boyfriend over here.

14:28.067 --> 14:30.885
He wants to take you
to a very dark and evil place.

14:31.100 --> 14:33.237
'A dark and evil place?'
Good on ya mate.

14:33.475 --> 14:34.675
Don't listen to him, Nat.
Let's just get out of--

14:34.724 --> 14:36.628
Mate,
I'm warning you now,

14:37.029 --> 14:39.998
Don't go out there.
It's a bad place.

14:40.429 --> 14:42.619
It's a bad place,
is it mate?

14:42.719 --> 14:45.130
Hey, why don't you run along inside
and have another beer?

14:45.341 --> 14:49.081
I know, why don't you and Blue
go shoot some 'roos or something?

14:49.083 --> 14:50.235
Mick, stop it.

14:50.236 --> 14:52.352
Or better still,
you can go fuck yourself.

14:52.353 --> 14:54.253
- Mick, get in the car, let's go!
- Let's go.  Get in the car!

14:54.308 --> 14:56.167
You're a fuckin' smart ass, mate.

14:57.773 --> 14:59.367
- You know what?
- Just get in the car!

14:59.419 --> 15:02.119
When you hit Mitchell,
turn left.

15:02.144 --> 15:06.119
Head towards St. George.
Charlie's farm's along there.

15:06.120 --> 15:09.569
- Hey!  Let him loose.
- Get in the car. Get in the car!

15:09.616 --> 15:10.871
Mate, thank you, alright.

15:10.871 --> 15:12.355
See you later my friend.
You've been too --

15:13.619 --> 15:15.819
<i>Can you hear the banjos playing?
Diddly, ding, ding, ding</i>

15:16.029 --> 15:18.819
<i>Shut up!
You're such an ass, Michael.</i>

15:20.429 --> 15:23.819
Go please!
Please,  just go! Go!

15:24.919 --> 15:26.951
Don't forget, St. George!

15:28.388 --> 15:32.415
Alright, guys, I want to know the truth.
What happened back there?

15:33.805 --> 15:38.679
Fine...  There's a place out here somewhere
 called Charlie's farm...

15:38.681 --> 15:41.898
and we thought it would be a good idea
to camp there for a couple of nights.

15:43.581 --> 15:45.171
Sounds like hay to me.

15:45.181 --> 15:47.743
Are you kidding me?  Did you see
the look on those people's faces

15:47.799 --> 15:50.944
when you said Charlie's farm
they got like... all weird.

15:50.945 --> 15:52.517
Honey, they werem't
acting weird.   Come on.

15:52.519 --> 15:54.114
Well,
they weren't laughing.

15:59.124 --> 16:01.371
Go on man, fill 'em in.

16:01.884 --> 16:02.884
Yeah, fill me in.

16:04.019 --> 16:05.144
Okay,

16:06.463 --> 16:07.513
I'll tell you what
I was told by people

16:07.613 --> 16:08.680
when I
was younger.

16:10.182 --> 16:13.182
Back in the mid 80s there was
a family that lived out here somewhere.

16:13.482 --> 16:15.783
Their names were
John and Merideth Wilson.

16:16.502 --> 16:19.753
Rumor has it that
John Wilson was an American.

16:20.582 --> 16:22.014
One of your Yankee mates.

16:24.813 --> 16:28.733
All I know is that they had a son,
called Charlie.

16:29.082 --> 16:31.455
And that this John
was one fucked-up fellow.

16:31.764 --> 16:33.726
Killin' backpackers
that worked on his farm

16:33.826 --> 16:36.078
and eating parts of 'em.

17:13.728 --> 17:15.228
Please?

17:15.328 --> 17:17.627
Please help me.

17:18.178 --> 17:19.820
Please?

17:20.648 --> 17:21.848
Please?

17:39.628 --> 17:41.071
Please?

17:46.028 --> 17:47.323
Will you
shut the fuck up?

17:52.278 --> 17:54.619
Just kill
the fucking whore.

18:04.228 --> 18:06.469
Please!

18:09.128 --> 18:11.518
We trying
to entertain in here.

18:12.975 --> 18:14.981
Where are my friends?

18:16.023 --> 18:18.875
Well, you got me there.

18:19.455 --> 18:22.392
Let me see them.
Please John,  let us go.

18:22.955 --> 18:25.415
Your friends are all dead.

18:25.755 --> 18:27.682
Hey,  it wasn't my fault.
- What do you mean?

18:27.715 --> 18:30.597
Well, If you shut-up
I will tell you about it.

18:32.407 --> 18:34.962
Alright.   Alright.
 Your friend--your friend Trevor,

18:35.230 --> 18:37.507
I hope he
wasn't your boyfriend.

18:37.508 --> 18:38.983
No!

18:40.652 --> 18:43.082
What a fuckin' pussy.

18:43.855 --> 18:46.249
He screamed
like a fuckin' girl.

18:46.855 --> 18:50.199
Now, it was when,
when he was asking for his mommy,

18:52.255 --> 18:55.455
that's when Merideth started
getting upset.

18:55.783 --> 18:57.346
You have no clue

18:57.671 --> 19:00.675
 how crazy my wife is when
she gets angry.

19:00.680 --> 19:02.470
I mean,
she is fuckin' psychotic.

19:03.967 --> 19:05.599
Anyway, um,

19:06.055 --> 19:10.705
Merideth is
really angry at you now.

19:10.720 --> 19:11.720
Oh, yeah.

19:11.855 --> 19:13.355
Why?  W--why?

19:14.532 --> 19:18.785
Well, how would you feel if
your husband was being seduced

19:20.032 --> 19:22.955
by a young slut
the last four days?

19:24.724 --> 19:27.530
Fuck, we both know
how you feel about me.

19:27.816 --> 19:29.293
Don't tell Merideth this, okay,

19:29.295 --> 19:32.071
but I think, I think we really
have something here.

19:32.570 --> 19:35.553
But, if she found out
that you were falling for me,

19:36.180 --> 19:37.757
she would fuckin'
kill you.

19:38.400 --> 19:40.850
You know, you lie here
all fuckin' naked,

19:41.010 --> 19:42.657
begging me for it,

19:44.067 --> 19:46.410
I mean, that's not
very fair to Meredith, not really.

19:46.412 --> 19:48.462
What are you talking about?

19:49.309 --> 19:51.167
You raped me!

19:51.932 --> 19:53.482
Wait a minute.

19:53.492 --> 19:55.502
Rape?
Rape?

19:55.582 --> 19:57.095
Are you kidding me?

19:57.098 --> 20:00.898
I mean you were lying back there,
you were moaning and groaning

20:01.276 --> 20:03.982
you're the loudest fuck
I have ever had.

20:04.482 --> 20:06.532
You're all fucking crazy.

20:06.534 --> 20:09.013
Okay, look, you're
not the tightest,

20:09.015 --> 20:13.750
but,  you are definitely
the best I have had so far.

20:14.416 --> 20:19.039
I mean,
you know, most girls they

20:19.040 --> 20:22.118
cry and they clamp-up,

20:22.543 --> 20:23.843
but you...

20:24.921 --> 20:28.732
you just lay back and
opened wide

20:28.742 --> 20:31.282
And said,
 'Give it to me, John.'

20:32.882 --> 20:34.182
<i>Charlie!</i>

20:35.092 --> 20:37.482
Come take the splits
out to the pigs.

20:41.282 --> 20:42.582
Charlie.

20:43.229 --> 20:44.229
Hey!

20:44.682 --> 20:47.182
Charlie, you heard your mom!

20:47.582 --> 20:48.919
Retard.

20:52.366 --> 20:53.366
Come on!

20:54.082 --> 20:56.327
Come on, get up!

20:56.492 --> 20:58.582
Get out there and do
what your mother told you to do.

21:03.914 --> 21:06.714
Word of advice,
don't ever breed.

21:07.336 --> 21:08.836
Did you see that?

21:09.236 --> 21:11.236
I mean,
we give that kid...

21:12.336 --> 21:15.036
 a roof over his head,
three square  meals a day,

21:15.577 --> 21:17.936
and you'd think he'd do
a couple of things around the house.

21:18.179 --> 21:19.636
What are you
going to do to me?

21:21.539 --> 21:24.344
Fuck, wait a minute, I--I thought
we were going to have a nice

21:24.446 --> 21:26.945
 d and m about young Charlie.

21:26.946 --> 21:30.835
And you're so selfish, you--
- John, What are you gonna do to me?!

21:32.336 --> 21:34.729
Okay, okay, okay,
take it easy.

21:35.339 --> 21:38.269
Look, the first thing we should do
is talk about dinner.

21:40.123 --> 21:41.423
Dinner?

21:42.123 --> 21:43.362
You're letting me go?

21:43.364 --> 21:44.564
Well...

21:45.445 --> 21:47.519
Ah, se--look,

21:47.588 --> 21:49.923
Merideth's been in there
all day

21:50.112 --> 21:51.428
bustin' her ass

21:51.591 --> 21:54.493
preparing the
retard's favorite.

21:55.823 --> 21:58.823
Backpacker spareribs.

22:03.653 --> 22:06.096
Oh my God,
you're so full of shit.

22:06.130 --> 22:08.323
Alright,
so the spareribs thing's mine.

22:08.373 --> 22:10.123
But I haven't even got close
to the good stuff yet.

22:10.173 --> 22:12.771
It's just one of those
campfire horror stories.

22:13.221 --> 22:14.923
You're just trying
to scare us, right?

22:14.924 --> 22:17.755
No,
It's a true story.

22:18.123 --> 22:20.102
Why do you think that the old bloke
at the pub got so pissed-off

22:20.104 --> 22:21.517
when you just mentioned a farm.

22:22.523 --> 22:23.923
Keep goin'.
I want to hear the rest.

22:25.523 --> 22:27.600
A few hours after
destroying this backpacker,

22:28.013 --> 22:30.853
the Wilson clan heard yelling coming
from their front yard.

22:45.223 --> 22:46.123
Boy.

22:46.573 --> 22:48.223
Get out here
and feed the pigs.

22:48.328 --> 22:50.667
What he
gonna' feed the pigs?

22:57.569 --> 22:58.866
Who the fuck is that?

22:59.304 --> 23:00.504
Could it be the cops?

23:02.723 --> 23:04.437
- No.
- Well, who could it be then?

23:04.446 --> 23:05.646
How the fuck do I know?

23:15.573 --> 23:18.018
Grab the retard.
If there's trouble, go bush.

23:27.923 --> 23:30.496
Here we go.
What, is the pub closed?

23:30.718 --> 23:32.710
John, we want you to
put an end to the madness

23:32.712 --> 23:34.745
that you and your boy have got
going on down here.

23:34.973 --> 23:37.756
Blue, why don't you take these barflies
and go back into town?

23:37.868 --> 23:40.131
You've been killing people out here,
 we know you have.

23:40.133 --> 23:41.591
Oh, fuck you!

23:42.036 --> 23:44.711
We're a couple of farmers.
We're just trying to earn a living.

23:44.713 --> 23:46.864
Now get the fuck off my property.

23:47.223 --> 23:48.194
I won't tell you  again.

23:48.196 --> 23:49.203
Or, what John?

23:49.210 --> 23:51.966
I think you and Merideth need
to go to the cops and hand yourself in.

23:51.970 --> 23:53.470
Hand ourselves in
for what?

23:53.733 --> 23:55.087
For killing
innocent people.

23:55.090 --> 23:57.880
All the workers you've had on the farm,
where are they?     <i>- Yeah, where are they?</i>

23:57.973 --> 23:59.630
They went mad and we shot 'em.

23:59.632 --> 24:01.721
Who the fuck is
telling you this shit?

24:01.733 --> 24:04.061
I heard you ate them,
you sick,  twisted fucks.

24:04.063 --> 24:06.607
What?  Oh, yeah,
now we're cannibals?

24:06.609 --> 24:07.897
Well, where are they, John?

24:07.899 --> 24:09.942
All these people who've
vanished over the years?

24:10.523 --> 24:11.911
They were a bunch of
hippie stoners,

24:11.913 --> 24:13.870
when they leave here,
I don't know where they go.

24:13.880 --> 24:15.270
And frankly,
I don't give a fuck.

24:15.354 --> 24:18.356
Cut the crap, John.
<i>- Where is that retarded son of yours?</i>

24:18.391 --> 24:22.071
Don't say that.  Don't piss her off.
I'll never hear the end of it.

24:22.368 --> 24:24.376
If you talk about my Charlie
like that again...

24:24.730 --> 24:27.967
then, I'll cut your fucking head off
and feed it to the dingos.

24:28.823 --> 24:30.123
Is that right, bitch?

24:30.723 --> 24:33.130
Well, you're going to find
it a bit hard with this problem.

24:35.666 --> 24:36.908
What problem?

24:37.387 --> 24:39.259
I don't have a problem.

24:39.689 --> 24:44.443
You're fucked.  You're fucked.
You're fucked.  You are all fucked.

24:44.445 --> 24:46.845
You don't even know
what your fucking dealing with.

25:01.734 --> 25:03.799
Charlie, Charlie,
fuck it, fuck it, fuck it!

25:03.801 --> 25:04.801
Drop it, drop it.

25:04.802 --> 25:06.202
Come, quick!

25:06.424 --> 25:08.530
Come on, hurry.

25:14.823 --> 25:16.723
That's all I heard, guys.

25:18.023 --> 25:21.407
Apparently, they took all the bodies
somewhere on Charlie's farm and buried 'em.

25:21.769 --> 25:22.992
Some people say
they put the bodies out

25:22.992 --> 25:23.992
for the razorbacks
to feed on.

25:25.108 --> 25:27.522
That jack-eye fellow said
Blue was there.

25:27.623 --> 25:30.735
So he would have to know what actually
happened to the mother and the kid.

25:33.522 --> 25:34.854
I don't get it.

25:35.389 --> 25:37.475
Why wouldn't
they just call the police?

25:37.708 --> 25:38.863
I don't know.

25:39.164 --> 25:41.040
They must have
their reasons, though.

25:41.338 --> 25:43.096
I mean, even the other corpses
they found in the house

25:43.098 --> 25:44.462
 all disappeared, which...

25:44.511 --> 25:46.376
sure left it like
an urban legend or something.

25:46.810 --> 25:49.653
Okay, hang on,
what's a "razorback" ?

25:50.562 --> 25:52.580
It's a pig.
- Yeah.

25:53.032 --> 25:54.911
Male wild pigs out here
are called boars--

25:55.105 --> 25:56.718
and razorbacks
if they're real big.

25:57.357 --> 25:59.824
So, Charlie hasn't been found
or seen again?

25:59.873 --> 26:02.420
Nope.  Vanished.

26:04.125 --> 26:05.700
Well, that's
how the story goes.

26:05.998 --> 26:09.390
Some people believe he was either
caught and killed by the locals or

26:09.392 --> 26:10.921
he's still in the outback.

26:12.979 --> 26:15.844
Some people believe he is
still alive somewhere.

26:17.960 --> 26:21.696
Yeah, but wouldn't someone have seen him
if he was still alive?    I mean--

26:22.149 --> 26:23.466
Not necessarily.

26:24.103 --> 26:26.099
The land out here
is massive.

26:26.166 --> 26:28.013
There are so many
caves and hiding spots out here

26:28.015 --> 26:30.050
that you can actually live out here
for 50 years and not be seen.

26:30.247 --> 26:32.356
I don't get it,
why would you guys wanna go there?

26:32.381 --> 26:36.151
I want to explore, you know,
like see if we can find the actual house.

26:36.312 --> 26:37.155
Look around.

26:37.223 --> 26:40.106
Honey, we could find
some really cool shit out there.

26:40.191 --> 26:42.999
What do you think we're going
to find out there?  This is so stupid.

26:43.001 --> 26:44.564
I don't know, just something, okay.

26:44.565 --> 26:46.472
This is going to be an
awesome adventure, okay?

26:46.474 --> 26:48.226
And, we wouldn't be
the only people doing this.

26:48.299 --> 26:49.892
There'd be heaps of people
who heard the stories

26:49.894 --> 26:50.894
that come out here
for a look.

26:50.896 --> 26:53.942
No, only you two retards.
Honestly.  Seriously.

26:53.969 --> 26:56.203
Look, I actually think
this could be fun.

26:56.487 --> 26:58.873
And if we don't like it, then
we can just pack-up and leave.

26:58.875 --> 26:59.775
All right?
- Yep.

26:59.777 --> 27:01.050
If we don't like it
we can leave.

27:02.592 --> 27:05.189
I think I'll give the bed a go.
I'll sees ya in the morning.

27:05.372 --> 27:07.068
Goodnight mate.
- Goodnight Jas.

27:09.859 --> 27:13.172
Hey, remember, if--if you don't  like it,
we'll just get out of there straight away.

27:13.274 --> 27:14.274
Okay?

27:16.413 --> 27:18.012
I just have
this bad feeling.

27:18.432 --> 27:20.249
I don't know,
I just...

27:21.006 --> 27:23.011
there's something
inside me--

27:24.575 --> 27:27.118
Look, if you guys want to go,
I'll go, but...

27:27.830 --> 27:30.160
it's just... I don't have
a good feeling about this.

28:03.212 --> 28:06.192
<i>I love you, Donkey.</i>

28:06.204 --> 28:09.271
Wake up.   Keep your hands
in sight.  - Fuck!  Dude.

28:09.359 --> 28:10.631
Piss off will ya?

28:10.673 --> 28:11.673
You nearly
scared the shit our of me.

28:11.827 --> 28:14.191
Oh hell no,
we have to find a farm.  Get up.

28:16.993 --> 28:18.477
Oh man,
that's disgusting.

28:20.848 --> 28:22.004
What happened?

28:22.032 --> 28:24.269
Well, you've either got a turtle-head butt
in your undies right now,

28:24.270 --> 28:25.752
or you're really just
fuckin' messed up inside,

28:25.752 --> 28:26.772
because that stinks!

28:26.777 --> 28:28.018
After the stunt you
just pulled,

28:28.019 --> 28:29.775
I think I do have to
back one out, actually.

28:31.075 --> 28:32.603
Nearly struck mud
with that one.

28:33.382 --> 28:36.316
Oo, that's disgusting.
- Too much information, guys.

28:37.957 --> 28:40.409
Are we really going to go
to this Charlie's farm place?

28:40.411 --> 28:41.411
Yes, we are,

28:41.760 --> 28:43.057
it's gonna
to be awesome.

28:45.207 --> 28:47.961
What about all those stories
that Mick said last night?

28:48.343 --> 28:50.535
Are they true?
- From what I've heard, yeah.

28:51.320 --> 28:54.361
You know, so what if
Charlie's still alive out there?

28:54.425 --> 28:56.070
I mean, wouldn't that be
a bad thing?

28:56.072 --> 28:57.975
No one's seen Charlie
for over 30 years now,

28:57.977 --> 29:00.301
so I highly doubt that he's gonna
come and party with us.

29:00.473 --> 29:02.983
Besides, me and Donkey
would kick his ass.

29:03.448 --> 29:05.212
Yeah, but what about that
guy from the bar?

29:05.547 --> 29:07.371
He said that all those people
went missing.

29:07.574 --> 29:09.122
He was  probably just talking
about the backpacker murders

29:09.124 --> 29:10.124
 down in South Australia.

29:10.182 --> 29:11.460
Look guys, we've got
nothing to worry about.

29:11.461 --> 29:13.049
Now, let's just get the gear sorted
and let's move

29:13.051 --> 29:14.685
because I want to
find this place today, okay?

29:14.856 --> 29:17.681
We'll leave right after
I go to the crapper.

29:17.705 --> 29:19.342
Mm, he's disgusting.

29:20.022 --> 29:22.455
Yeah, I think
I just lost interest, yeah.

29:38.766 --> 29:41.496
Where are we?
- We're headin' toward St. George.

29:41.522 --> 29:42.831
What's  St. George?

29:43.643 --> 29:45.888
Hey Donkey,
that boy from the pub said

29:45.889 --> 29:47.933
head toward St. George,
then what did he say?

29:48.324 --> 29:49.756
No, that's
all he said, mate.

29:51.812 --> 29:54.250
Nat.
Call Tony.

29:54.723 --> 29:56.023
This is
so stupid.

29:56.074 --> 29:57.512
He'll know
where to go.

29:58.423 --> 30:01.027
Tony?
 Hi, it's Natasha.

30:01.137 --> 30:03.542
Who's she callin' ?
- Tony Stewart.

30:03.554 --> 30:04.548
Good on ya.

30:04.550 --> 30:05.932
I'm serious.
Tony Stewart.

30:05.934 --> 30:08.424
Why?     -Who is that?
- Tony 'The Hitman' Stewart.

30:08.598 --> 30:11.098
Tony 'The Hitman' Stewart...
makes him a boxing champion.

30:11.128 --> 30:12.003
- Why?
- Yeah, that's the one.

30:12.452 --> 30:14.666
Fuck, that dude's hard to know.
How do you know him?

30:14.668 --> 30:15.668
Oh, Tiny!

30:15.670 --> 30:17.345
- You know him too?
- Yeah, you know--

30:17.494 --> 30:18.494
For fuck's sake!

30:18.979 --> 30:21.844
He said it's really dangerous
and we shouldn't be going there.

30:21.949 --> 30:23.068
How do we get there?

30:24.193 --> 30:25.996
He's asking
how we get there.

30:27.556 --> 30:29.088
He said,
let's not go.

30:29.099 --> 30:31.307
Give me the phone.
Give me the... give me the phone.

30:31.354 --> 30:32.354
Your'e such an asshole.

30:32.451 --> 30:33.319
Tiny,
are you there?

30:33.320 --> 30:34.320
It's Jason.

30:35.742 --> 30:38.677
I'm sorry mate, my reception's shitty ass.
Are you there?

30:39.706 --> 30:41.341
Hand on mate,
let me pull out.

30:54.706 --> 30:55.512
Are you there mate?

30:55.514 --> 30:57.785
Yeah.
So, Charlie's farm, huh?

30:57.920 --> 30:59.554
Somebody's feeling brave.

30:59.644 --> 31:02.528
<i>I've never been out there,
but it's got a bad reputation.</i>

31:02.690 --> 31:03.801
So I've heard.

31:03.803 --> 31:05.524
You've been talking to
some of the locals, huh?

31:05.526 --> 31:07.132
Yeah, what can you
tell me about it?

31:07.278 --> 31:08.964
Well, I know
it's a big place.

31:09.889 --> 31:11.591
Something like a
million acres.

31:12.275 --> 31:15.246
I'm sure the farm house is
pretty far in from the road, though.

31:15.483 --> 31:19.276
Apparently, a couple of backpackers
disappeared out there not too long ago.

31:19.934 --> 31:21.371
That's fuckin' awesome.

31:21.553 --> 31:23.298
<i>Yeah, well,
don't get too excited.</i>

31:23.323 --> 31:27.287
Any time anyone disappears,
people automatically blame Charlie's farm.

31:27.841 --> 31:30.262
The cops don't even bother
going out there anymore.

31:31.863 --> 31:33.452
How long you goin'
out there for?

31:33.668 --> 31:36.296
Oh, one maybe two days,
I'm going to head back into Randolph.

31:36.343 --> 31:37.343
Okay.  Well--

31:37.344 --> 31:40.071
Do me a favor:
While you're out there watch your backs

31:40.073 --> 31:43.131
and when you get back to  Mitchell,
give me a call so I know you're okay.

31:43.244 --> 31:45.832
Yeah, nice.
So how do we actually get there?

31:45.869 --> 31:48.526
You gotta get the most popular guy
on the news calling youse,

31:49.051 --> 31:52.218
the one who can carry two coffee
and twelve donuts.

31:53.048 --> 31:54.598
I don't get it.
- I  don't get it either.

31:54.788 --> 31:56.619
<i>It's too funny...</i>

31:56.656 --> 31:58.463
Okay mate.
Cheers.

31:58.672 --> 32:01.405
Thank you.
- You're still an asshole.

32:04.020 --> 32:05.178
Well, what did he say?

32:05.179 --> 32:06.407
He said: "Be careful,

32:06.409 --> 32:08.740
be good to your mother,
wear a rubber and go this way."

32:30.613 --> 32:32.132
I have to
take a piss.    -Aw!

32:32.702 --> 32:34.655
This has gotta be it.
- Lovely.

32:39.993 --> 32:41.701
That's a big lock.

32:41.953 --> 32:42.953
I know, right!

32:43.390 --> 32:46.036
I said lock, Donkey, lock!

32:54.531 --> 32:55.531
Hey dude!

32:55.770 --> 32:57.447
Come check this out.
- What is it?

32:57.957 --> 32:59.235
Look at this.

32:59.259 --> 33:01.494
This is it.
It actually says Wilson on it.

33:01.589 --> 33:03.359
That was
their last name.

33:03.432 --> 33:06.967
See, I told you this was the real deal,
and there's proof motherfucker.

33:07.255 --> 33:08.500
That's the one.

33:08.739 --> 33:09.601
- Ah, that's awesome.
- Yeah!

33:09.915 --> 33:11.564
Come give us
a hand with the gate, man.

33:15.942 --> 33:17.456
I'll go get on
this side.

33:20.462 --> 33:21.462
Shit.

33:22.695 --> 33:24.707
Oh crap!
That's just perfect.

33:24.728 --> 33:27.194
- What?   - Well, the gate's locked,
and we can't get through.

33:27.750 --> 33:29.371
So let's go
find another gate.

33:29.396 --> 33:31.971
Nat, this is their gate.
This is where they live.

33:32.653 --> 33:33.653
Shit!

33:34.839 --> 33:35.839
All right.

33:36.165 --> 33:37.426
We walk.

33:37.457 --> 33:39.246
We walk and
we leave the car here.

33:40.343 --> 33:43.264
Did he--did he just say walk?
- We're not walking.   -No.

33:43.427 --> 33:45.383
Yes, we are.  I mean,
if we keep driving any further,

33:45.384 --> 33:47.384
we might actually go too far and
miss their actual house.

33:47.439 --> 33:49.116
I mean, this seems to be
their driveway, honey.

33:49.195 --> 33:51.507
We need to take these
and for safety reasons as well.

33:51.545 --> 33:52.966
Yeah, I agree, mate.

33:53.040 --> 33:55.481
Oh, as much as I hate walking,
I think he's right.

33:55.523 --> 33:58.064
Plus, if we follow the driveway,
we can at least find our way back.

33:59.873 --> 34:01.813
- Please?
- Okay.

34:01.916 --> 34:04.049
But how long is
this walk gonna be?

34:04.051 --> 34:05.822
I dunno,
maybe a kilometer or so.

34:06.239 --> 34:07.839
It's not goin' to be
too far from the road.

34:07.880 --> 34:08.830
What do
you reckon, boss?

34:08.831 --> 34:11.023
Yes.    Let's just
get what we need and do this.

34:11.025 --> 34:12.025
Please.  Come on.

34:13.027 --> 34:14.440
- Alright.
- Ready yet?

34:14.822 --> 34:18.550
So,we're really doing this?
We're really walking?

34:18.562 --> 34:20.135
Yeah,
it will do you some good.

34:20.150 --> 34:23.125
What do you mean by that?
Are you s-- are you saying I'm fat?

34:23.127 --> 34:25.187
Yes, now that's exactly
what he's saying.

34:25.188 --> 34:27.183
No, that's not what I'm saying--I'm saying,
the exercise will do you some good.

34:27.206 --> 34:28.188
You're a prick.

34:28.190 --> 34:29.416
You know, I'm saying
It will do us all some good.

34:29.418 --> 34:31.887
No, you're a prick.
You're an idiot.

35:01.165 --> 35:03.212
It's horrible
walking through this grass.

35:04.489 --> 35:06.228
You guys
have pants on.

35:06.395 --> 35:07.791
You've got pants on.

35:08.463 --> 35:09.663
For now.

35:10.972 --> 35:14.211
You are a sick and
dirty, dirty dog.

35:14.456 --> 35:16.364
You guys, how much farther
do you think it's gonna be?

35:16.663 --> 35:17.636
Not much further.

35:17.638 --> 35:19.482
We barely just started walking and--
- I do need to go.

35:19.578 --> 35:21.470
What, a whole--
whole 800 meters?

35:21.713 --> 35:23.382
I'm not going to
last that long.

35:23.384 --> 35:25.717
- Oh, my God!
- You'll be alright.  - I need to go.

35:27.552 --> 35:29.075
Put a
cork in it.

35:29.927 --> 35:31.760
Wait 'till we get
to like more grass.

35:49.294 --> 35:52.313
Okay guys, we've
been walking for ages.

35:53.063 --> 35:54.640
Are you sure we're on the way
to the actual farm?

35:54.642 --> 35:56.812
I don't know.  Let's just keep
walking a little longer

35:56.814 --> 35:58.903
and we might find somewhere
to camp soon.  Okay?

35:58.905 --> 36:00.990
Baby, she's right.  We've been
walking for like two hours.

36:00.995 --> 36:03.901
So, what time is it mate?
- It's--it's four thirty.

36:03.917 --> 36:06.748
Let's just camp here.
- No, come on, let's go.

36:06.995 --> 36:09.147
- Okay.    -No.
- Yeah, let's go.  -Come on.

36:09.453 --> 36:11.246
It has to be
around here somewhere.

36:19.453 --> 36:21.448
Fair view scene.
- What?

36:24.713 --> 36:26.592
Yeah, it's beautiful.

36:28.078 --> 36:31.344
You guys, maybe the locals,
like they burned it down.

36:31.353 --> 36:33.268
You know,
it doesn't exist anymore,

36:33.399 --> 36:34.468
 it's not here.

36:34.853 --> 36:37.676
Well, if that was the case,
they could've taken the gates with them.

36:38.364 --> 36:39.364
That's for sure.

36:39.390 --> 36:40.416
Let me see
your bags.

36:40.499 --> 36:41.765
Actually,
that would suck.

36:42.193 --> 36:43.453
Why would that suck?

36:43.500 --> 36:44.656
No, if--if it was all
burnt down.

36:44.667 --> 36:46.692
I can tell you that
it's not burnt down, guys.

36:47.760 --> 36:48.760
Why is that?

36:48.792 --> 36:50.162
Because I'm lookin' at it.

36:50.165 --> 36:52.866
Holy snappin' duck shit, Batman,
there it is.

36:52.994 --> 36:54.445
That's where we're
sleeping tonight guys.

36:54.918 --> 36:56.877
Are you kidding me?

36:56.879 --> 36:58.679
Ah, it'd be sweet.  I'm not kidding.
Come on, let's go.

36:58.703 --> 37:01.020
A place to be warm.
- You won't get cold.

37:20.156 --> 37:21.204
Well?

37:21.369 --> 37:22.932
Well what?

37:23.542 --> 37:25.600
I think she means:
'who's going in first?'

37:25.685 --> 37:27.654
Jason is.
He's the horror lover.

37:27.820 --> 37:30.283
Nah.  Let's just all
go in together.

37:30.996 --> 37:32.796
Come guys,
it doesn't look that bad.

37:33.402 --> 37:35.335
This is stupid,
let's just go.

37:48.843 --> 37:49.843
Wow.

37:55.153 --> 37:56.253
Oh my God!

37:56.295 --> 37:58.705
Look at this place.
- I know.

37:59.660 --> 38:01.269
Awesomes huh?

38:01.487 --> 38:03.934
Awesome?  Rather creepy.

38:09.878 --> 38:11.140
Look all this stuff.

38:19.224 --> 38:21.161
Don't want to get
left out.

38:26.575 --> 38:30.407
Noah and Becky.
That's romantic.

38:32.707 --> 38:34.949
'I've survived Charlie's farm."

38:35.254 --> 38:36.332
Check this out.

38:36.343 --> 38:37.343
What is it?

38:42.732 --> 38:44.049
What is it?

38:44.388 --> 38:45.764
Snakeskin.

38:46.655 --> 38:47.655
Ugh.

38:56.454 --> 38:57.654
What happened?

38:57.811 --> 38:59.749
Asshole!
- We're all good.

39:00.563 --> 39:01.568
- God!
- Let me try.

39:06.395 --> 39:08.316
- You sure?
- Yeah.

39:10.914 --> 39:11.914
Whoa.

39:12.105 --> 39:13.303
What's that?

39:14.604 --> 39:17.956
Aww.  Look at this.

39:17.958 --> 39:18.958
Is this cute
or what?

39:19.248 --> 39:22.180
- Maybe it was Charlie's?
- Shut up with you, smart ass.

39:23.590 --> 39:24.741
Mel, what
are you doing?

39:24.778 --> 39:26.044
I want
to keep it.

39:26.064 --> 39:27.689
-  You know, that's
a really bad idea.    -  Why?

39:27.691 --> 39:30.140
Nat, if she wants to keep it,
let her keep it, it's fine.

39:30.142 --> 39:32.138
Hey, that could be
a collector's item right there.

39:32.388 --> 39:35.116
In fact, there's probably heaps
of shit around here that we can sell.

39:35.118 --> 39:36.471
Hey, that's not as silly as it sounds.

39:36.472 --> 39:38.615
 There's so much shit in here
that people would love.

39:38.689 --> 39:39.711
No, no way.

39:39.875 --> 39:41.549
You can keep the teddy bear
if you want, that's fine,

39:41.551 --> 39:43.297
 but everything else stays.

39:44.976 --> 39:46.913
Don't worry mate,
I'll go talk to her.

39:52.907 --> 39:53.907
Mmmh...

40:17.586 --> 40:21.269
-  Aaah!
- Oo, oo, oooh!

40:21.892 --> 40:24.192
Char-lie...

40:24.265 --> 40:25.405
It was the wind.

40:25.407 --> 40:26.707
Ha, ha,
It was the wind.

40:28.085 --> 40:29.996
Look at this place!

40:46.190 --> 40:47.993
Alright guys, if we are
going to stay here tonight,

40:47.995 --> 40:49.434
we're all
sleeping together.

40:49.518 --> 40:51.337
<i>Why the hell
do we have to do that?</i>

40:52.411 --> 40:53.778
Yeah, I agree.

40:54.351 --> 40:55.351
Aaahhh...

41:09.897 --> 41:12.833
'I've survived Charlie's farm."
- Yeah.

41:14.171 --> 41:16.631
Hey, it's hard to believe we're
in the exact house

41:16.633 --> 41:18.133
where all those
murders took place.

41:18.312 --> 41:20.912
And the father was shot
just out there.

41:21.023 --> 41:23.244
Who knows how many people
were killed in here.

41:23.249 --> 41:24.249
<i>Merideth?</i>

41:24.925 --> 41:26.635
<i>Let's check
everywhere here guys.</i>

41:28.276 --> 41:29.992
<i>(gagging) Merideth?</i>

41:37.938 --> 41:39.138
<i>Merideth.</i>

41:42.981 --> 41:45.431
<i>Aughh, what is that smell?</i>

42:44.004 --> 42:48.698
Charlie, there are very bad men out there
who want to hurt us.

42:48.801 --> 42:50.658
No matter what happens,
you must not come out.

42:50.660 --> 42:51.735
Do you understand?

42:51.914 --> 42:54.932
Charlie,
-do-  -you-   understand?

42:55.276 --> 42:56.276
Run!  Go.

42:56.440 --> 42:57.440
Come on.

43:08.885 --> 43:14.478
Come on you pack of faggots.
You killed my John.

43:14.523 --> 43:17.053
I'll kill everyone of  you
and feed it to the pigs

43:17.055 --> 43:18.847
you bunch of
faggot wankers.

43:23.850 --> 43:25.687
Is there
anyone else here alive?

43:25.890 --> 43:27.773
I'm not
telling you shit!

43:28.280 --> 43:30.125
Tell me
where they are.

43:31.475 --> 43:33.952
Fuck off!

43:34.851 --> 43:37.565
Where are they?
- Fuck off!

43:45.296 --> 43:46.630
Where's the retard?

43:47.217 --> 43:51.228
Why don't you
come here...

43:51.410 --> 43:53.212
and say that,

43:53.735 --> 43:56.137
ya fuckin' gutless swine?

44:02.557 --> 44:06.150
Where -is- the retard?

44:07.244 --> 44:10.478
Charlie died twelve
months ago.

44:23.565 --> 44:24.565
Where is he?!

44:24.588 --> 44:28.124
That's already asked,
he's been gone a long time.

44:29.786 --> 44:32.139
Let's just kill her
and be done with it.

44:32.315 --> 44:34.386
I don't believe
a thing this bitch says.

44:34.720 --> 44:35.830
Hold still

44:36.524 --> 44:38.485
Do you hear that, bitch?

44:39.680 --> 44:44.552
That- -retarded--
He's not going to last long out here.

44:47.276 --> 44:48.742
Let's get this
over and done with.

44:49.518 --> 44:51.985
<i>The farmers continued
to brutally bash Merideth.</i>

44:52.502 --> 44:55.059
<i>The whole time,
Charlie was watching.</i>

44:55.196 --> 44:57.328
<i>Without shedding
a single tear.</i>

44:58.745 --> 45:00.511
<i>He's going to
beat her to death.</i>

45:00.624 --> 45:04.202
<i>She cries, screams, and laughs.</i>

45:05.437 --> 45:08.644
I'll sleep like shit now.
- Yeah, that was a bit much, mate.

45:08.748 --> 45:11.544
You know, this is surreal.

45:11.845 --> 45:13.312
You two are sick.
Seriously.

45:13.422 --> 45:15.652
Oh, come, Nat now,
I agree it's weird and scary

45:15.654 --> 45:17.441
but it's definitely cool,
don't ya think?

45:17.499 --> 45:19.216
It would be a lot cooler

45:19.223 --> 45:21.318
if big guy over there would
shut his mouth.

45:21.341 --> 45:23.075
I didn't mean to
scare you.

45:23.382 --> 45:26.179
Look, don't panic,
nothing will happen.

45:28.131 --> 45:29.916
You know what?
This reminds me of a joke.

45:29.918 --> 45:30.918
Do you
want to hear it?

45:30.920 --> 45:32.438
Yeah, go on.
- Only if it's funny.

45:32.440 --> 45:33.440
Well, it is.

45:33.500 --> 45:35.581
Well, I thought it was when
my mate e-mailed it to me.

45:35.583 --> 45:37.094
Mate, just
get on with the joke.

45:37.670 --> 45:38.770
Alright.

45:38.852 --> 45:40.248
So Charles Manson...

45:40.273 --> 45:41.406
Oh, come on.

45:41.410 --> 45:43.348
Nat, it's just a joke.
Come on, I want to hear it.

45:43.423 --> 45:45.397
- Me too.
- Don't  joke, Mel.

45:46.187 --> 45:48.356
Alright, so Charles Manson, alright?,

45:48.356 --> 45:50.336
he's walking through the forest
with this guy.

45:50.600 --> 45:52.042
And this fellow
turns to him and says,

45:52.044 --> 45:55.552
"Dude, this is
one scary forest."

45:56.076 --> 45:58.830
And Charles turns to him and says:
"Shut up man,

45:58.923 --> 46:01.704
I'm the one who's gotta
walk outta here on my own."

46:02.424 --> 46:03.491
That is so stupid.

46:03.615 --> 46:04.748
I don't get it.

46:04.786 --> 46:06.252
Who's Charles Manson?

46:06.490 --> 46:08.614
You don't know who
Charles Manson is?    - No.

46:08.758 --> 46:11.163
He's like, the biggest
serial killer in the world.

46:12.020 --> 46:13.886
I st--   well, I still
don't get it.

46:14.052 --> 46:16.028
He's walking the man
to the bush to kill him

46:16.053 --> 46:18.499
and then he has to walk back out
on his own in the dark.

46:18.598 --> 46:19.598
Oh!

46:20.615 --> 46:22.215
Still not funny.

46:24.554 --> 46:25.554
What?

46:25.802 --> 46:26.902
Anyway....

46:27.591 --> 46:29.191
Who's up for
some exploration?

46:29.505 --> 46:31.138
Now?
- Right now.

46:31.300 --> 46:32.300
No way.

46:32.672 --> 46:34.101
I'll do most things
with you, man,

46:34.101 --> 46:37.134
but there is  <i>no way</i>
I'll go around this farm at night.

46:37.314 --> 46:39.330
That is the smartest thing
you have said all day.

46:39.338 --> 46:42.676
'I still don't get it.'
- No.

46:42.678 --> 46:45.906
You guys are all wimps.
This is supposed to be an adventure.

46:45.908 --> 46:47.121
We'll do it tomorrow.

46:47.128 --> 46:50.022
Alright.  Righto.  Tomorrow we have to
thoroughly search this place

46:50.022 --> 46:52.367
because we could find some
really cool shit out here, okay?

46:52.678 --> 46:54.891
Okay?
Done.

46:55.135 --> 46:57.460
I'm really--
I'm going to bed.

46:57.751 --> 46:59.830
- Yeah, I figure.
- Me too.

46:59.854 --> 47:02.251
I'm worn out from all the walking
you made us do.

47:02.251 --> 47:03.251
Whatever.

47:04.248 --> 47:06.611
Does this place look like
the  <i>Blair Witch</i>  house, or what?

47:06.644 --> 47:07.906
Donkey, shut up!

47:08.108 --> 47:10.376
Too soon to see
the little red handprints, though.

47:10.401 --> 47:12.920
Donkey, stop. Just go to bed.
- Alright, alright.

47:13.084 --> 47:15.331
Too far, brother.
- Nighty-night.

48:26.071 --> 48:27.391
'Morning, bro.

48:27.508 --> 48:30.399
Hey mate, did ya sleep good?
- Yeah, pretty good actually.

48:30.423 --> 48:32.774
What time is it?
<i>- It's twelve fifteen.</i>

48:32.801 --> 48:35.181
Really?      <i>- Mmm-mmh.</i>
Holy shit, we slept for ages.

48:35.361 --> 48:36.997
Yeah, must have been
the long drive in.

48:37.029 --> 48:40.984
Shut up and let me sleep some more.
- No way.  Up and at 'rm.  Let's go.

48:41.009 --> 48:42.730
Hey, do you know where we
can find some water?

48:42.755 --> 48:45.668
Kitchen's busted.
- Nope.  Look at you, you idiot.

48:46.261 --> 48:48.456
Oh then, we did cross a small creek
on the way up here,

48:48.458 --> 48:50.320
so I'm sure it runs
through the property somewhere.

48:50.529 --> 48:52.840
Let's find it today.
- Thanks, Dad.

48:52.966 --> 48:54.150
Come on. Up, up!

48:56.313 --> 48:59.303
No, I'm tired.
- Come on Natasha just...

48:59.498 --> 49:01.638
get up.
- No.

49:02.339 --> 49:03.939
Give me a hand
with some breakfast.

49:04.245 --> 49:05.675
Do it yourself.

49:08.744 --> 49:09.944
Hey, check this out.

49:10.767 --> 49:11.853
What is it?

49:11.892 --> 49:13.825
There's a couple of people
coming this way.

49:14.586 --> 49:15.824
What are they
doing here?

49:16.010 --> 49:17.110
Hello there!

49:17.691 --> 49:18.691
Hello!

49:19.478 --> 49:20.803
'Guess we'll find out
in a minute.

49:20.928 --> 49:24.480
Are there really people out there?
<i>- Yeah, looks like a couple of campers.</i>

49:28.763 --> 49:29.763
Look at that bloke.

49:29.908 --> 49:31.576
He looks
ike a ginger <i> 'Wolverine'.</i>

49:34.741 --> 49:36.373
<i>- Hi.</i>
- G'day.

49:37.558 --> 49:39.025
How ya doin' ?
<i>- Good.</i>

49:39.574 --> 49:41.907
I'm Jason.  This is Donkey.

49:41.909 --> 49:43.109
- Howdy.
- Hello.

49:43.202 --> 49:44.802
I'm Alyssa
and this is Gordon.

49:44.805 --> 49:46.405
- Hey guys.
- Hello, pleased to meet ya.

49:46.438 --> 49:47.441
I thought we were
the only ones out here.

49:47.442 --> 49:48.442
Yeah, so did we.

49:48.485 --> 49:50.441
Where are you guys from?
- Sydney.

49:50.707 --> 49:52.709
We've been travellng around Australia
working and stuff.

49:53.246 --> 49:55.122
Met a bunch of backpackers
about four weeks ago,

49:55.124 --> 49:56.524
they  told us about
this place.  So...

49:56.613 --> 49:58.167
we thought we'd
check it out.

49:58.206 --> 49:59.540
Are they still here?

50:00.237 --> 50:01.745
Last we met,
they were headed this way--

50:01.747 --> 50:03.118
but haven't
seen them since.

50:03.894 --> 50:06.268
Where are you guys from?
- We are from the Sunshine Coast.

50:06.293 --> 50:09.487
But Jason's missus here, is a Yank.
But we don't hold that against her.

50:09.652 --> 50:11.319
Hi, nice to
meet you both.

50:11.437 --> 50:12.340
Come on in.

50:12.365 --> 50:13.351
I hope you guys
are hungry,

50:13.353 --> 50:14.971
we were just about to make
some breakfast oats.

50:15.295 --> 50:16.295
Good idea.

50:16.921 --> 50:20.018
We're starving.
We have been walking for days.

50:20.227 --> 50:22.132
<i>- It's very American
- Is it cold there?</i>

50:22.855 --> 50:24.925
- This is so Aussie right now.
- Could you not cook it at all, though?

50:24.956 --> 50:26.084
We had nothing
to cook it with.

50:26.086 --> 50:27.398
It's not like we have
a microwave or anything.

50:28.423 --> 50:30.145
Do you know
who Charles Manson is?

50:30.515 --> 50:32.996
You don't know who Charles Manson is?
- No, I don't.

50:33.021 --> 50:35.410
- Alyssa knows.
- Everyone knows who Charles Manson is.

50:35.435 --> 50:36.835
She's right, Melie.

50:36.973 --> 50:40.058
So, what brought you guys out here?
- These two weirdos.

50:40.629 --> 50:41.957
I know
what you mean.

50:42.052 --> 50:44.050
Gordon has been
dying to see this place.

50:44.059 --> 50:45.926
I thought it was some kind of
urban legend or something,

50:45.927 --> 50:47.527
until we saw the house
in the distance.

50:47.529 --> 50:49.150
Yes, so did we..
<i>- Whatever.</i>

50:49.158 --> 50:51.053
Wait here. I want to show
you something.  - Okay.

51:00.795 --> 51:03.339
<i>- Beans?
-Beans, beans.</i>

51:13.810 --> 51:15.135
Mel, what's wrong?

51:15.262 --> 51:16.627
I'm losing
my mind.

51:17.270 --> 51:18.716
What'd you lose?

51:18.749 --> 51:20.571
Her mind,
she just told ya.

51:21.507 --> 51:22.614
What happened?

51:22.639 --> 51:24.458
Yeah, well, when we went to bed,
I had the bear with me,

51:24.483 --> 51:26.685
And now it's gone...
it's not in my bag.

51:26.710 --> 51:28.310
Yeah, I saw the bag.

51:30.136 --> 51:32.046
Jason?  Donkey?

51:32.636 --> 51:34.874
What's up?
- Come here for a minute.

51:36.394 --> 51:38.712
Ah, here we go.
What's goin' on?

51:40.816 --> 51:41.816
What's wrong?

51:41.841 --> 51:44.277
Did one of you two
steal her teddy bear last night?

51:45.382 --> 51:46.961
Why would
we do that?

51:47.663 --> 51:49.771
Don't look at me,
I never touched it.

51:50.133 --> 51:52.201
Maybe he walked himself
back to the room.

51:52.568 --> 51:55.261
Okay, something weird
happened last night

51:55.263 --> 51:56.363
while we
were asleep.

51:56.548 --> 51:58.577
It was only for like, a second,
 I swear, but...

51:59.235 --> 52:02.908
there was a figure standing there
in the doorway just watching us.

52:02.915 --> 52:05.513
- Right.   - Sounds like you
had a dream there, Melie.

52:06.029 --> 52:08.685
- Well, did one of you two get up?
- No, I don't know, it wasn't one of them.

52:08.710 --> 52:10.910
This figure was huge.

52:12.351 --> 52:14.008
Maybe you really did
just have a nightmare.

52:14.009 --> 52:16.732
I mean, after all the scary stories
that Mick told last night.

52:20.080 --> 52:21.744
Oh yeah,
you're probably right.

52:21.792 --> 52:24.131
Okay, hopefully it will show up.
Let's worry about this later.

52:24.131 --> 52:25.671
I'm going to
get ready, now.

52:27.320 --> 52:29.315
- Hey, can we put our stuff in here
with you, okay?   - Yeah, sure.

52:29.340 --> 52:30.609
It's surreal.

52:30.634 --> 52:32.555
-  I know.    - He was here.
- I know, I saw it too.

52:32.929 --> 52:34.062
He was lyiing
next to you.

52:35.169 --> 52:37.015
Alright, cleanup ladies.

52:49.231 --> 52:51.051
Hey, hey, hey,..
I've got an idea.

52:51.195 --> 52:53.449
Why don't we go
in three groups of two.

52:53.481 --> 52:54.998
Okay, that's a good idea.
You guys cool with that?

52:54.998 --> 52:56.098
Yeah, no problems here.

52:56.187 --> 52:58.357
I don't know.
Shouldn't we stick together?

52:58.382 --> 52:59.789
No, we  have a few hours
to look for things,

52:59.891 --> 53:01.713
then we're out of here tomorrow.
 This is it.

53:04.470 --> 53:05.870
Mel, it'll be fine.

53:06.181 --> 53:07.985
And you
better take care of her.

53:08.025 --> 53:09.634
You know
I will.

53:09.666 --> 53:10.946
It'll be fun, Mel.

53:10.971 --> 53:13.171
It is like <i>"Crocodile Dundee."</i>

53:15.258 --> 53:16.493
Where are your boots?

53:16.518 --> 53:19.145
Fuck, forgot my boots.
You guys go ahead, I'll catch up.

53:19.366 --> 53:20.366
Alright.

53:20.367 --> 53:21.692
Oh, hey,
here's the game plan.

53:21.693 --> 53:23.856
Let's meet back at the house
before dark.

53:24.310 --> 53:27.389
And, remember where you're going
so you can find your way back.

53:27.420 --> 53:29.256
Not mate.

53:30.741 --> 53:32.023
Let's go,

53:32.048 --> 53:33.315
<i>What's that boots?</i>

53:33.624 --> 53:35.273
<i>You're back at the other camp?</i>

53:40.708 --> 53:42.842
So you reckon
the stories are true?

53:43.271 --> 53:45.161
Why?   What have
you heard?

53:45.224 --> 53:47.689
Not a whole lot, just what
the backpackers told us.

53:47.729 --> 53:50.772
They reckon the place is haunted.
They're into all that ghostbusting shit.

53:50.799 --> 53:52.530
Mate, there is no way
the place is haunted.

53:52.530 --> 53:55.241
I mean you've seen the house.
It's all bullshit.

53:56.890 --> 53:58.127
Still, it'd be better if
we saw something.

53:58.129 --> 53:59.729
We did come eight hours
out of our way.

53:59.806 --> 54:01.547
You're the one
that wanted to come.

54:01.704 --> 54:02.666
I'm not whinging,

54:02.666 --> 54:04.929
I'm just saying that it would be
better if we saw something.

54:04.979 --> 54:05.933
He's playing it down,

54:05.933 --> 54:08.286
he's been talking about it
the whole way.

54:08.288 --> 54:09.559
Are you kidding me?

54:09.601 --> 54:12.886
He actually owns one of those
<i>'Halloween'</i> hockey masks.

54:12.952 --> 54:15.093
Excuse me.
That is a Limited Edition

54:15.095 --> 54:17.142
'Jason Voorhees' mask.
Thank you very much.

54:17.333 --> 54:18.979
You're right.
He does love that stuff.

54:19.004 --> 54:20.907
There's nothing wrong with that.
I have a steel 'Freddy Krueger' glove.

54:20.909 --> 54:22.197
Yeah? Whoa!

54:22.565 --> 54:25.544
Boys and their toys.
- You are just jealous.

54:25.569 --> 54:29.153
I'm so jealous of your toys.
- She's jealous.

54:34.056 --> 54:35.256
Augh!

54:35.641 --> 54:39.501
Aw, Donkey, you stink.  That's disgusting.
- What?  I didn't do anything.

54:40.194 --> 54:42.115
Something really smells
around here.

54:44.827 --> 54:46.967
It smells like it's coming from
this old mine shaft.

54:47.366 --> 54:50.295
There's probably old oil drums and
stuff leaking down there.

54:51.706 --> 54:54.773
That doesn't smell like oil it smells like
real bad, a dead emu or something.

54:55.258 --> 54:56.276
Dead emu?

54:56.665 --> 54:58.781
How do you know what a
dead emu smells like?

54:59.000 --> 55:00.359
I don't know, could be.

55:00.508 --> 55:01.508
Fair enough.

55:09.369 --> 55:11.439
I tell you,
I just saved your life!

55:13.291 --> 55:14.455
Just.

55:15.314 --> 55:16.619
Get going.

55:44.359 --> 55:46.959
Alright, you guys come and meet us
back here in a few hours?

55:46.992 --> 55:48.593
Yeah, we'll be fine.
- Fuck yes!

55:48.618 --> 55:50.618
I think I'm going to find
myself a dead body.

55:51.050 --> 55:52.050
What?

55:52.301 --> 55:53.447
At least a finger.

55:53.796 --> 55:55.225
Right, I'll
see you guys later.

55:55.273 --> 55:57.778
Good luck with that one.
- Yeah, right.

56:03.348 --> 56:05.298
Do you think
this is a good idea?

56:05.323 --> 56:07.297
Honey, we've got
nothing to worry about.

56:07.309 --> 56:09.296
Besides, this is gonna be
perfect for Mel and Donkey

56:09.298 --> 56:10.950
to get a little bit
of alone time.

56:12.097 --> 56:13.455
What do you
think is gonna happen?

56:13.589 --> 56:15.289
She's not
<i>that into him.</i>

56:15.305 --> 56:16.772
<i>Good point.</i>

56:24.017 --> 56:25.550
Can I ask
you a question?

56:25.749 --> 56:26.749
Yes.

56:27.126 --> 56:28.273
When we get back

56:28.703 --> 56:31.522
Do you wanna, like
go roam or something?

56:33.012 --> 56:35.441
That's not exactly
the reaction I was lookin' for.

56:35.720 --> 56:37.851
Sorry.  What exactly
do you mean?

56:37.851 --> 56:40.665
You know, do you want to like,
go out with me?

56:40.667 --> 56:41.867
Together--

56:42.769 --> 56:44.864
Mick, do you wanna be
my boyfriend?

56:45.247 --> 56:46.247
Well, yeah.

56:46.874 --> 56:48.210
You alright with it?

56:48.506 --> 56:51.593
Well, for at least talking up very good
and asking girls out, I am.

56:51.618 --> 56:52.672
Well, I don't do it
all that often.

56:52.674 --> 56:54.819
And besides,
I... kinda like you.

56:54.883 --> 56:57.548
Kinda?
You just wanna get laid.

56:58.197 --> 56:59.947
Maybe if you play your
cards right.

57:00.290 --> 57:01.290
Whoop!

57:04.400 --> 57:05.579
Come here a bit.

57:05.705 --> 57:07.737
Ah, I don't think so.
- Come on.

57:07.762 --> 57:09.964
Really.   Forget about it.
That thing's disgusting.

57:11.164 --> 57:12.680
Well, I'm out
for a swim.

57:13.000 --> 57:16.305
Wanna join?
- I didn't bring anything to swim in.

57:16.719 --> 57:17.770
Get in here.

57:19.150 --> 57:20.251
Keep dreaming.

57:21.721 --> 57:23.388
Well, swim in
your knickers then.

57:23.662 --> 57:24.662
My God!

57:25.729 --> 57:26.729
What?

57:27.904 --> 57:30.104
Are you really going in?
- Hell yeah.

57:30.588 --> 57:32.188
Come on
 It'll be fun.

57:36.522 --> 57:37.857
Come on!

57:39.827 --> 57:40.827
Yoohoo!

57:48.311 --> 57:49.521
Is it cold?

57:49.748 --> 57:51.748
It's alright
once you're in.

57:51.827 --> 57:54.287
What about crocs?
- There are no crocs.

57:54.312 --> 57:55.576
Get your ass
in here.

57:56.720 --> 57:57.922
Come on.

57:58.783 --> 57:59.985
Come on.

58:06.370 --> 58:07.760
Oh, there's
your camera.

58:07.780 --> 58:09.820
Oh yeah, chuck it here.
It's waterproof.

58:09.850 --> 58:10.850
- Is it?
-Yeah.

58:14.312 --> 58:15.804
Turn around.

58:27.409 --> 58:29.133
It's not that bad.

58:29.158 --> 58:30.358
It's freezing.

58:36.594 --> 58:37.898
It's freezing.

59:03.767 --> 59:06.790
Maybe it's locked.
- No shit, Sherlock.

59:06.970 --> 59:08.284
Aw, let's go around.

59:13.153 --> 59:15.414
Aw, check this baby out.
- Gordon, put it down.

59:15.968 --> 59:18.933
I'm serious. That thing is dangerous.
- Drink it.!

59:18.958 --> 59:21.096
I'm serious. Put it down.

59:22.161 --> 59:24.495
Alright, we're definitely
coming back for this bad boy.

59:37.104 --> 59:38.229
Go in?

59:43.821 --> 59:45.141
Do you smell that?

59:47.086 --> 59:49.148
It smells like something's
dead in here.

59:49.579 --> 59:51.445
Probably a dead animal.

59:51.836 --> 59:53.212
Ugh, it's disgusting.

59:53.829 --> 59:55.056
Or...

59:55.532 --> 59:58.095
it's one of
Charlie's victims.

59:58.869 --> 01:00:00.735
Stop it.
That's not funny.

01:00:05.431 --> 01:00:07.463
Drums for the campfire.

01:00:21.010 --> 01:00:22.510
Check this shit out,
will ya?

01:00:23.544 --> 01:00:26.077
Some of it must be like,
50 years old.

01:00:27.355 --> 01:00:29.699
It's like they just disappeared
and everything's been left the way it was.

01:00:30.261 --> 01:00:32.461
Yeah.  It kinda
freaks me out, really.

01:00:32.761 --> 01:00:34.284
Why?  There's
nothing to be scared of.

01:00:34.309 --> 01:00:37.081
I don't know,
I just dom't like places like this.

01:00:37.355 --> 01:00:38.687
You know that.

01:00:42.917 --> 01:00:44.450
I mean, look
at that old bed.

01:00:45.815 --> 01:00:47.238
What about the
old bed?

01:00:48.956 --> 01:00:51.351
I'm telling you right now,
no one has been in that in years.

01:00:51.353 --> 01:00:53.047
Looks pretty fresh
to me.

01:00:53.339 --> 01:00:55.739
I mean, what if
someone's staying here?

01:00:56.253 --> 01:00:57.553
I can tell you right now,

01:00:57.555 --> 01:00:59.355
no one has slept there
in a long time.

01:00:59.426 --> 01:01:00.739
From where
I'm standing, Gordon,

01:01:00.741 --> 01:01:03.273
it looks like someone or something
has been sleeping in it.

01:01:03.341 --> 01:01:05.170
I highly doubt that Aly.

01:01:06.653 --> 01:01:07.933
If it makes you feel
any better,

01:01:07.934 --> 01:01:09.863
I say we find the others
and tell them what we found.

01:01:09.897 --> 01:01:11.582
You don't have to
tell me twice.

01:01:11.637 --> 01:01:12.737
Let's go.

01:04:58.363 --> 01:04:59.518
No way.

01:04:59.543 --> 01:05:02.253
What?  What's wrong?
This is why we're here.

01:05:02.526 --> 01:05:04.440
I'm not going in there.
I'm scared.

01:05:04.456 --> 01:05:06.724
Well, at least give me
five minutes to check it out

01:05:06.726 --> 01:05:07.926
and then we'll leave, okay?

01:05:08.003 --> 01:05:09.307
I'm waiting outside.

01:05:09.315 --> 01:05:10.815
Just come in
and have a quick look.

01:05:10.828 --> 01:05:12.865
I have a bad feeling
about this.

01:05:14.787 --> 01:05:16.404
I don't know,
I'm staying outside.

01:05:17.133 --> 01:05:19.347
Suit yourself.
I have to see.

01:05:34.207 --> 01:05:35.473
You're stupid!

01:05:36.425 --> 01:05:37.695
I still can't reach 'em.

01:05:37.872 --> 01:05:39.672
Well, there's no reception
out there, Tony,

01:05:39.685 --> 01:05:40.692
Yes, I know that,

01:05:40.717 --> 01:05:43.247
I just figured that they'd get out there
and realize there's nothing to see

01:05:43.272 --> 01:05:44.952
and then head
on back.

01:05:45.978 --> 01:05:47.827
I called Nat's brother
last night

01:05:47.829 --> 01:05:51.016
and he told me that her boyfriend is
prone to get himself into trouble.

01:05:52.173 --> 01:05:53.640
What do you
mean by that?

01:05:54.306 --> 01:05:56.211
Apparently, he's always
finding himself

01:05:56.211 --> 01:05:58.072
in the wrong place
at the wrong time.    - Well,

01:05:58.313 --> 01:06:00.438
even you do that sometimes.

01:06:00.972 --> 01:06:01.972
Hmm.

01:06:02.689 --> 01:06:04.854
I, ah, think I'm going
to take a ride out there

01:06:04.854 --> 01:06:05.854
and see if
I can find 'em.

01:06:06.392 --> 01:06:08.859
They're old enough
to take care of themselves.

01:06:11.384 --> 01:06:12.497
Wanna go with me?

01:06:12.499 --> 01:06:15.296
Hell no.  I do not want
to go out there.

01:06:15.478 --> 01:06:17.556
If you want to go,
you go on your own.

01:06:19.416 --> 01:06:20.762
I don't know.

01:06:21.462 --> 01:06:24.220
Something about them being
out there alone is bothering me.

01:06:26.592 --> 01:06:28.433
I think I'll take a ride out there,
see if I can find them

01:06:28.435 --> 01:06:29.635
and bring them
all back here.

01:06:29.637 --> 01:06:32.199
Tony, you said they were
staying for two nights.

01:06:32.314 --> 01:06:33.617
Now, let it go.

01:06:35.205 --> 01:06:36.838
I can't,  Nance.

01:06:38.252 --> 01:06:40.119
I'll see you
in a few hours.

01:06:46.675 --> 01:06:47.875
Check this out.

01:06:48.956 --> 01:06:51.156
It's the
Loch Ness monster.

01:06:53.712 --> 01:06:54.812
Come here.

01:06:58.314 --> 01:06:59.614
You're a shocker.

01:07:04.971 --> 01:07:08.658
My God. It's huge.
- Alright, he won't hurt you.

01:07:08.783 --> 01:07:09.909
No.

01:07:10.065 --> 01:07:11.598
He's huge!

01:07:11.759 --> 01:07:13.967
I thought that was a man.
- Fuck me!

01:07:15.556 --> 01:07:17.423
What are you
lookin' at, pervert?

01:07:18.846 --> 01:07:20.245
Piss off, will ya?

01:07:24.221 --> 01:07:26.252
Wh--Wh--Where are you going?
- I've got to get rid of him.

01:07:26.277 --> 01:07:28.506
Just stay here.  Just-- just wait there.
- Just be careful.

01:07:28.508 --> 01:07:29.508
Seriously, mate.

01:07:30.245 --> 01:07:31.448
What's your problem?

01:07:32.355 --> 01:07:33.579
Just go away.

01:07:42.084 --> 01:07:43.151
Yeah, I  know,
right?

01:07:43.176 --> 01:07:44.309
Scary, huh?

01:07:45.264 --> 01:07:47.509
Don't get too close.
- It's alright, Mel.

01:07:47.647 --> 01:07:49.148
I think he's
a bit retarded.

01:07:52.187 --> 01:07:53.287
Yaaaw!

01:09:15.219 --> 01:09:16.908
Pretty.

01:09:17.995 --> 01:09:20.212
Stop!  Please!

01:09:57.999 --> 01:09:58.999
Jason!

01:09:59.728 --> 01:10:01.328
What are you doing?

01:10:02.010 --> 01:10:04.484
Your time is definitely up.

01:10:06.243 --> 01:10:08.709
Jason, you're being
an idiot.

01:10:08.895 --> 01:10:10.990
This is something that
Donkey would do.

01:10:15.130 --> 01:10:18.424
Jason, at least tell me
you're okay.

01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:22.383
I told you
this was a bad idea!

01:10:23.092 --> 01:10:25.059
Jason, this is
bullshit!

01:10:29.799 --> 01:10:33.727
Jason, you're acting
like an asshole.

01:10:36.210 --> 01:10:37.410
Jason!

01:10:41.194 --> 01:10:42.294
Hello?

01:10:42.993 --> 01:10:43.993
Guys?

01:10:45.394 --> 01:10:47.612
Jason, Natasha.

01:11:50.191 --> 01:11:51.832
Jason!

01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:55.222
Jason, please!

01:11:55.877 --> 01:11:57.495
Where are you?

01:11:58.833 --> 01:12:00.481
<i>Natasha.  Over here.</i>

01:12:00.912 --> 01:12:02.434
What are you doing?

01:12:02.841 --> 01:12:04.864
I'm just telling you,
get over here, right now!

01:12:05.053 --> 01:12:06.576
What are you doing?

01:12:07.122 --> 01:12:08.755
This is not funny.
- Shh, shh, shh.

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:12.177
There is someone
out there.

01:12:14.552 --> 01:12:15.853
I'm not joking,
okay?

01:12:15.853 --> 01:12:18.686
I just saw someone or something
before I heard ya.

01:12:23.847 --> 01:12:25.284
I'm serious,
okay?

01:12:25.371 --> 01:12:27.551
And, whoever it was,
he was fucking massive.

01:12:28.754 --> 01:12:29.754
Seriously.

01:12:30.734 --> 01:12:32.835
I just saw--               - Shut up!
 I saw a fucking man down there, alright--

01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:35.065
Shut up.
- No.

01:12:35.629 --> 01:12:38.699
There was a man up here,
and he's going to fuckin' kill us, alright?

01:12:38.724 --> 01:12:40.057
I'm not joking.

01:13:06.741 --> 01:13:08.613
Come on.
- No, I don't wanna go.

01:13:08.638 --> 01:13:11.038
We have to go.
- No, I don't want to go.

01:13:19.729 --> 01:13:20.682
Let's go.

01:13:20.707 --> 01:13:21.908
This side. Here.  Here.

01:13:23.383 --> 01:13:24.383
Shit!

01:13:25.393 --> 01:13:26.393
Who is that?

01:13:27.963 --> 01:13:29.807
Are you listening
to me?

01:13:30.182 --> 01:13:31.182
Here.

01:13:32.549 --> 01:13:33.749
Let go of me!

01:14:02.289 --> 01:14:04.046
I don't wanna die.

01:14:21.432 --> 01:14:22.987
Is that you, Jason?

01:14:26.816 --> 01:14:27.956
Where is Natasha?

01:14:30.883 --> 01:14:31.883
Where is she?

01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:35.102
What's the matter
with you?

01:14:37.219 --> 01:14:39.203
Oh...  okay.
Alright.

01:14:39.981 --> 01:14:40.981
Calm down!

01:14:41.903 --> 01:14:44.239
Let's not do
anything stupid here.

01:14:44.817 --> 01:14:46.582
One of us
is gonna get hurt.

01:15:12.313 --> 01:15:13.313
Alright.

01:16:11.649 --> 01:16:14.133
We have to help him.
- No, you can't go.

01:16:14.626 --> 01:16:16.428
Look, just stay here.
Just stay here.

01:16:51.210 --> 01:16:52.309
Run!

01:25:25.745 --> 01:25:27.910
Help me.
- Quiet girlie.

01:25:29.449 --> 01:25:30.449
Was it him?

01:25:30.802 --> 01:25:32.333
Look at me.
Was that Charlie?

01:25:32.358 --> 01:25:33.691
He's down there.

01:25:33.716 --> 01:25:35.849
Come on.  Hurry up.
We've gotta go.

01:25:40.978 --> 01:25:41.979
Where's the police?

01:25:42.102 --> 01:25:43.602
Why didn't you bring
the fucking police?

01:25:43.659 --> 01:25:45.361
There's no police coming
out here.

01:25:45.363 --> 01:25:46.663
It's just me.

01:25:47.905 --> 01:25:49.712
Hurry up,
he's going to fucking catch us.

01:25:49.714 --> 01:25:51.202
If you idiots never
came out here,

01:25:51.204 --> 01:25:53.013
we wouldn't even be
in this mess.

01:25:53.116 --> 01:25:55.039
And it you hadn't killed
thirty years ago,

01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:56.740
none of my friends
would be dead.

01:25:56.998 --> 01:25:58.071
Get in the truck.

01:26:08.174 --> 01:26:09.805
What are you doing?

01:26:39.612 --> 01:26:41.101
Come and get it, Charlie.

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:20.400
Fuck you,
Charlie!
