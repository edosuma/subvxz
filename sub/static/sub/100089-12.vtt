WEBVTT

00:00.164 --> 00:02.266
Welcome to Hilltop.

00:02.299 --> 00:03.945
No! No! Pete can't stay!

00:04.006 --> 00:06.365
Through Teachers-in-Service Day!

00:06.390 --> 00:07.772
You know, I don't know who Pete is,

00:07.805 --> 00:10.058
but I do know
that you're embarrassing him.

00:10.121 --> 00:12.024
Douglas, our beloved Hilltop parrot

00:12.057 --> 00:15.027
has to stay alone at school
over the three-day weekend.

00:15.059 --> 00:17.262
It's cruel. Inhumane.

00:17.295 --> 00:19.285
- Will you sign a petition...
- No.

00:20.836 --> 00:23.101
Did you just dismiss my
8-year-old daughter's activism?

00:23.134 --> 00:24.969
Activism? Come on.

00:25.003 --> 00:26.138
Don't be Lollypop Boy.

00:26.170 --> 00:27.538
What does that eve... I'm sorry.

00:27.571 --> 00:28.940
Am I supposed to
understand that reference?

00:28.974 --> 00:31.243
No. Honestly, it just got away from me.

00:31.276 --> 00:33.145
- Ah.
- Don't you ignore me, Rocco!

00:33.177 --> 00:34.836
Don't be a part of the problem!

00:34.883 --> 00:36.484
Pete shouldn't have to
spend the weekend alone,

00:36.517 --> 00:38.687
so Sophie's petitioning
Vice Principal Yarble

00:38.721 --> 00:40.022
to let us take him home with us.

00:40.055 --> 00:42.024
Man, I am so proud
of that kid's conscience.

00:42.056 --> 00:44.059
Oh, please. You do it
because it makes you look good.

00:44.092 --> 00:45.193
- What?
- The accolades.

00:45.227 --> 00:47.062
10 bucks says that
you're wearing a T-shirt

00:47.096 --> 00:48.497
- with Sophie's face on it.
- Pfft.

00:48.529 --> 00:50.166
- Unzip the sweater. Let me help you.
- I'm not going to.

00:50.199 --> 00:52.034
- Don't touch me! It's my body!
- Okay.

00:52.066 --> 00:53.535
All right, fine, but you know damn well

00:53.568 --> 00:55.471
my resolution was
to do more silk-screening.

00:55.504 --> 00:57.373
There you go.

00:57.406 --> 01:00.042
This is about helping Sophie
develop a strong moral compass.

01:00.074 --> 01:02.178
And, yes, I've picked out my suit

01:02.211 --> 01:03.646
for the Student of the Year ceremony.

01:03.679 --> 01:05.647
Heads-up, this guy's going with maroon.

01:05.681 --> 01:07.182
It's not a suit if it isn't black.

01:07.215 --> 01:08.416
It's a costume.

01:08.450 --> 01:10.186
She's the next Greta...

01:10.218 --> 01:11.354
something.

01:11.387 --> 01:13.189
Gosh! I wish I could remember
her last name.

01:13.221 --> 01:15.024
- She's so important.
- I bet.

01:15.057 --> 01:16.092
Will Cooper.

01:16.125 --> 01:18.194
Vice Principal Yarble! How are you?

01:18.226 --> 01:19.761
Terrible.

01:19.795 --> 01:22.665
I was taking a cat nap when your
daughter's screams awakened me.

01:22.697 --> 01:23.732
Make her stop.

01:23.765 --> 01:25.734
Let me coast into the sweet embrace

01:25.768 --> 01:27.236
of a three-day weekend.

01:27.268 --> 01:28.870
I already laid out my pajamas.

01:28.903 --> 01:30.211
Oh, she'll stop as soon as you agree

01:30.267 --> 01:31.602
to let us take Pete home
for the weekend.

01:31.656 --> 01:32.929
Oh, no.

01:32.969 --> 01:35.010
Then another kid will want
to take him home next weekend,

01:35.044 --> 01:36.411
and another,

01:36.444 --> 01:38.714
and soon I'll be running
some kind of check-out process.

01:38.747 --> 01:41.417
Don't make my life harder, Will Cooper.
Please, I can't take it.

01:41.450 --> 01:45.121
Well, then, I'm sorry to say,
Sophie's campaign will continue.

01:45.153 --> 01:47.056
No! No! Pete can't stay!

01:47.089 --> 01:48.123
That's my girl.

01:48.157 --> 01:51.226
Greta Thunberg! Ah, that's the name.
I remembered.

01:51.259 --> 01:52.727
Now, that is a face to silk-screen.

01:52.760 --> 01:53.962
Sophie!

01:53.995 --> 01:56.065
Release Rocco from the headlock.

01:56.098 --> 01:58.200
That's not how we want
to get our signatures.

01:58.232 --> 02:00.097
Rocco, sign the petition.

02:00.162 --> 02:02.319
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx
<font color="#0080ff">www.</font>addic7ed<font color="#0080ff">.com</font>

02:02.357 --> 02:04.189
02x12 - <i>Welcome to the Hilltop!</i>

02:05.339 --> 02:08.077
And then Pronstroller was all, like,

02:08.110 --> 02:09.711
"Should we just do the damn thing?"

02:09.744 --> 02:11.780
And I was all, like, "Uh, yeah."

02:11.814 --> 02:14.784
And then, bam.
Exclusive relationship, wassup?

02:16.118 --> 02:17.219
Happy for you.

02:17.251 --> 02:18.587
And thank you for walking me through

02:18.619 --> 02:20.367
all the physical acts
preceding that conversation.

02:20.392 --> 02:21.423
You're welcome.

02:21.449 --> 02:23.618
But, yo, I think I'm in love.

02:23.659 --> 02:25.161
I gave her one of my hats.

02:25.194 --> 02:28.297
Wow. Now, hat's a big deal.

02:28.330 --> 02:29.731
Mnh-mnh. Don't do that.

02:29.765 --> 02:31.634
I was being open and vulnerable
with you right now.

02:31.666 --> 02:33.235
Oh, there she is.

02:33.267 --> 02:35.337
She's coming to pick me up.
Total girlfriend move!

02:37.473 --> 02:38.673
Mm.

02:44.512 --> 02:47.617
- We enjoy long hugs.
- That's hot as hell.

02:50.052 --> 02:52.021
Just got an earful of Miggy love.

02:52.053 --> 02:53.822
Can we talk about anything else?

02:53.856 --> 02:55.391
Let's see, not much going on with me.

02:55.416 --> 02:58.026
I finally tried a Baked Lay.
Don't know who those are for.

02:58.059 --> 02:58.899
Mnh.

02:58.924 --> 03:00.063
Poppy!

03:00.088 --> 03:02.198
Oh. Here we go.

03:02.231 --> 03:04.632
Ooh, isn't that Ron's new piece?

03:04.665 --> 03:06.034
His wife, Angie.

03:06.068 --> 03:07.937
Her name's Sharon.
You were at her wedding.

03:07.969 --> 03:09.371
You took a million pics together.

03:09.404 --> 03:12.173
- Geez. My memory is garbagio.
- Hey, Poppy!

03:12.207 --> 03:14.677
What's poppin', Poppy? What's poppin'?

03:14.709 --> 03:16.379
Okay, we can just start talking, Sharon.

03:16.411 --> 03:18.236
I'm assuming you're here because
Ron did something stupid.

03:18.276 --> 03:19.447
Is the accent back?

03:19.481 --> 03:22.650
Oh, no wine for me, uh,
because, big news...

03:22.683 --> 03:23.651
we're pregnant!

03:24.852 --> 03:26.154
Get in here. Touch it.

03:26.188 --> 03:27.322
- Mm.
- Kiss it.

03:27.356 --> 03:29.125
Say your name to it
so it knows who you are.

03:29.158 --> 03:31.494
Wow-eee! Poppy, did you hear that news?

03:31.527 --> 03:34.563
- Yes, Angela, I heard.
- And we're happy?

03:34.595 --> 03:36.464
I'm just trying
to follow your lead here.

03:36.498 --> 03:37.833
Congratulations, Sharon.

03:37.866 --> 03:39.368
Gonna go neutral. Got it.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.536
Oh, Poppy, you should come
with me to my ultrasound today.

03:41.570 --> 03:43.005
I'm gonna find out the sex.

03:43.038 --> 03:45.908
Ooh! Wow! Oh, God, this is a tough one.

03:45.940 --> 03:48.676
I already, uh, promised Angie

03:48.709 --> 03:49.844
that I would hang out with her today.

03:49.878 --> 03:52.148
She's having, uh,
gastrointestinal problems.

03:52.181 --> 03:53.682
Yeah, it's just flowing through her.

03:53.714 --> 03:54.717
She's wearing a diaper right now.

03:54.749 --> 03:56.284
Come on, man.

03:57.886 --> 03:59.855
Yeah, it's true.

03:59.887 --> 04:03.259
My doc says that my butt tubes
are all out of whack.

04:03.291 --> 04:04.527
Sucks.

04:04.559 --> 04:05.994
Oh. Gross.

04:06.028 --> 04:07.563
Well, next time, then?

04:07.595 --> 04:09.331
Maybe. You know what?
So sorry. We have to go.

04:09.363 --> 04:11.833
Yeah, I can tell by Angie's face
she's in great distress.

04:11.867 --> 04:12.868
- Oh.
- Okay.

04:12.900 --> 04:14.437
Yeah.

04:14.469 --> 04:17.238
Okay, that was big news,
and I am here for you,

04:17.272 --> 04:19.341
but we have to discuss
why every on-the-fly excuse

04:19.373 --> 04:21.666
- involves me dropping heat in my pants.
- Copy that.

04:27.882 --> 04:29.796
Ugh. How am I getting worse?

04:29.835 --> 04:31.854
- Welcome to Hilltop.
- Thanks, Pete.

04:31.887 --> 04:33.241
Wait, what?

04:37.392 --> 04:39.594
Sophie Cooper, did you steal that bird?

04:39.628 --> 04:41.596
I saved him.

04:41.630 --> 04:44.433
You told me my moral compass
would never steer me wrong.

04:44.466 --> 04:46.068
Oh, boy. That does sound like me.

04:46.101 --> 04:47.736
We'll give Pete a great weekend

04:47.769 --> 04:50.306
and then bring him back
before school starts.

04:50.339 --> 04:52.808
I know stealing is wrong,
but in this case,

04:52.841 --> 04:55.377
I really believe
it's the right thing to do.

04:55.409 --> 04:58.080
Okay, wow. I raised
a remarkable young woman.

04:58.113 --> 04:59.081
Great dad!

04:59.113 --> 05:00.882
Did you just say "great dad"
to yourself?

05:00.916 --> 05:02.919
- Sorry, what?
- Welcome to Hilltop.

05:03.851 --> 05:05.587
Okay. Pete can stay.

05:05.620 --> 05:07.722
It is such a bummer
they keep him cooped up.

05:07.755 --> 05:09.524
Poor guy's probably
never even flown before.

05:15.496 --> 05:17.398
Pete, it's just you and me now.

05:17.431 --> 05:19.568
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

05:19.601 --> 05:22.395
Welcome to Hilltop.

05:22.458 --> 05:25.974
That was wild back there, huh?

05:26.007 --> 05:27.142
You know what?
I'm gonna be here for you.

05:27.176 --> 05:29.310
Today, I'm Poppy.

05:29.344 --> 05:32.014
Okay, so, your ex-husband
is having a baby.

05:32.046 --> 05:33.481
Talk to me. How do you feel?

05:33.515 --> 05:36.084
Honestly? Weird.

05:36.118 --> 05:38.120
I mean, she invited me
to her ultrasound, Ang.

05:38.152 --> 05:39.821
I didn't knock her up.
Why is it my damn problem?

05:39.854 --> 05:41.956
- It's not!
- You know what I think?

05:41.990 --> 05:44.326
It's a generational thing. Sharon's 23.

05:44.358 --> 05:46.161
The youth today have no concept
of boundaries.

05:46.195 --> 05:48.764
Millennials. God! I hate them!

05:48.796 --> 05:50.599
No respect.

05:50.632 --> 05:52.668
It's like, this is a society.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.469
We have rules for a reason.

05:54.503 --> 05:55.904
Ma'am, you have to pay for that.

05:57.039 --> 05:59.140
Ang, you know
we're Millennials, too, right?

05:59.173 --> 06:00.642
Yeah, but you get it.

06:00.676 --> 06:03.045
Mm. Yeah, anyway, back to Sharon.

06:03.077 --> 06:05.647
What's next? She wants me
present for the actual birth?

06:05.681 --> 06:07.649
Gosh. I'm gonna wrap my legs around her,

06:07.683 --> 06:08.784
"Handmaid's Tale" -style?

06:08.817 --> 06:11.053
Uch, hate that show.

06:11.085 --> 06:12.554
I've never seen it.

06:12.587 --> 06:14.522
Hold up. Is that...?

06:14.556 --> 06:16.825
Miggy's girlfriend
with a man that's not Miggy.

06:16.858 --> 06:19.128
A smokin'-hot man.

06:19.161 --> 06:21.697
This is s-so messed!

06:21.729 --> 06:24.058
Just today, he was telling me
they're exclusive.

06:24.089 --> 06:25.772
- See?
- Uh-huh.

06:25.797 --> 06:26.499
- See?
- Uh-huh.

06:26.524 --> 06:27.259
- See?
- Uh-huh.

06:27.284 --> 06:28.404
- See?!
- Uh-huh!

06:28.436 --> 06:30.471
- This is exactly what I was talking about.
- Exactly!

06:30.505 --> 06:32.173
We're not gonna let her
burn Miggy like this.

06:32.207 --> 06:34.335
- In fact, we're gonna follow them.
- Yeah.

06:34.374 --> 06:36.037
- Catch them in the act.
- Okay.

06:36.101 --> 06:37.245
- Mm-hmm.
- So, just to be clear,

06:37.279 --> 06:39.038
you want to deal
with Sharon's pregnancy by...

06:39.069 --> 06:41.186
- tailing Miggy's girlfriend?
- You bet your ass I do.

06:41.233 --> 06:42.350
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:42.383 --> 06:45.122
Because I am done letting
this over-sharing, milk-hating,

06:45.147 --> 06:47.655
rotary-phone-not-remembering
generation get away with it!

06:47.688 --> 06:48.690
You in?

06:48.724 --> 06:49.959
- Let's ride.
- All right.

06:51.760 --> 06:53.394
Hey, for the cookies.

06:53.428 --> 06:55.598
And whatever else my friend
stole while she was here.

06:57.765 --> 06:59.068
♪ Washin' spoons ♪

06:59.101 --> 07:01.170
♪ Washin' the dishes ♪

07:01.202 --> 07:02.770
- ♪ Scrubbin' forks ♪
- Hey, Dad.

07:02.803 --> 07:04.606
♪ I'm washin' a knife ♪

07:04.640 --> 07:06.175
♪ Washin' spoons ♪

07:06.207 --> 07:10.945

07:10.979 --> 07:13.015

07:13.048 --> 07:15.250
♪ Yeah, I'm washin' the dishes ♪

07:15.284 --> 07:18.553
♪ Scrubbin' forks,
scrubbin' the knives ♪

07:18.587 --> 07:19.555
♪ Washin' bowls ♪

07:19.587 --> 07:21.222
This is it, Pete,

07:21.255 --> 07:23.524
the moment you've been denied
your whole life.

07:23.558 --> 07:26.128
It's time to fly!

07:26.161 --> 07:27.930
Welcome to Hilltop. Wait...

07:29.399 --> 07:31.422
Sophie, what was that?!

07:32.876 --> 07:35.274
I just wanted him to fly,
as nature intended.

07:35.321 --> 07:36.477
And because I loved him,

07:36.532 --> 07:38.772
I assumed he would fly back to me.

07:38.827 --> 07:41.038
Aw, honey, you couldn't have
known his wings were clipped.

07:41.063 --> 07:42.464
I'm a murderer.

07:42.498 --> 07:44.801
You are not a murderer.

07:44.841 --> 07:47.707
The upturned rake that Pete fell
directly onto is the murderer.

07:47.754 --> 07:49.055
You just made a mistake.

07:49.088 --> 07:51.758
A mistake that resulted in
the death of an innocent bird.

07:51.790 --> 07:54.394
And the only thing I can do now
is to be honest

07:54.427 --> 07:55.996
and turn myself in to Yarble.

07:57.262 --> 07:59.331
Which means it's over.

07:59.365 --> 08:02.269
I can kiss that future
we planned for me goodbye.

08:02.302 --> 08:03.970
I know you just saw a bird die,

08:04.002 --> 08:05.572
but I think you're being
a little dramatic.

08:05.605 --> 08:07.841
Am I? I'll probably get a suspension,

08:07.874 --> 08:10.010
which means that'll take me
out of the running

08:10.043 --> 08:11.310
for Student of the Year.

08:11.343 --> 08:13.112
That stings.

08:13.146 --> 08:14.814
Especially since we set aside

08:14.848 --> 08:16.917
such a good spot on the Sophie shelf.

08:16.949 --> 08:18.250
I said goodbye to all of that

08:18.283 --> 08:20.086
the day that I threw that bird
off the roof.

08:20.119 --> 08:21.655
That was today.

08:21.687 --> 08:22.923
Wait.

08:22.956 --> 08:24.624
Sophie, what are you doing?

08:24.656 --> 08:27.326
I'm removing these reminders
of my former self.

08:27.360 --> 08:29.095
I'm going nowhere.

08:29.127 --> 08:33.866
Well... just to play devil's...

08:33.900 --> 08:35.934
if you turn yourself in
and lose your good standing,

08:35.967 --> 08:38.169
you won't be able to fight
for things in the future.

08:38.203 --> 08:40.506
And that wouldn't be right.

08:40.539 --> 08:43.543
Sophie, do you think that maybe

08:43.575 --> 08:45.511
your guilt is punishment enough?

08:45.545 --> 08:47.146
I mean, Pete wouldn't want you

08:47.180 --> 08:49.114
to lose everything over this, right?

08:49.147 --> 08:51.450
No. He would want
to welcome me to Hilltop.

08:51.483 --> 08:53.118
That's right, he would.

08:53.151 --> 08:54.887
But what are we gonna do?

08:54.920 --> 08:57.223
Vice Principal Yarble's
gonna see that Pete's missing,

08:57.257 --> 08:59.020
and she'll know it was me.

09:01.227 --> 09:02.496
Not if we cover it up.

09:03.997 --> 09:05.799
You and I aren't built for lying.

09:05.832 --> 09:06.900
You're right.

09:06.933 --> 09:08.367
We'll never be able to pull this off.

09:08.401 --> 09:09.969
We need a bad person.

09:10.002 --> 09:12.702
Someone 100% morally bankrupt.

09:13.705 --> 09:16.342
I understand our services are needed.

09:16.376 --> 09:18.745
We hear there's evidence
that needs to be destroyed.

09:18.777 --> 09:20.346
Don't worry. We're discreet.

09:25.517 --> 09:28.452
Ugh, they just opened
another bottle of wine.

09:29.460 --> 09:31.657
When are Pronstroller
and Round Head McNormal Face

09:31.690 --> 09:32.992
gonna smush already?

09:33.026 --> 09:34.327
I'm hungry.

09:34.359 --> 09:36.161
Don't people usually have snacks
at these stakeouts?

09:39.464 --> 09:41.533
You're offering me loose beef jerky

09:41.566 --> 09:43.168
from your glove compartment?

09:43.202 --> 09:44.737
Sorry, princess.

09:46.039 --> 09:48.508
Oh, hell yeah, that's hard to eat.

09:48.540 --> 09:51.511
Also, you own a tiny spy telescope?

09:51.544 --> 09:52.913
Wanna tell me the story of buying that?

09:52.945 --> 09:54.880
Just very curious about your headspace

09:54.914 --> 09:56.016
during that time of purchase.

09:56.049 --> 09:57.449
Thank you for your question.

09:57.483 --> 09:59.953
- First of all, it's a spyglass.
- Oh.

09:59.986 --> 10:02.923
And it was reasonably priced
at 400 tickets at Dave & B's,

10:02.955 --> 10:05.557
which I easily won
rippin' it at Skee-Ball.

10:05.590 --> 10:07.459
You know what? You and I
are best friends, but we have

10:07.492 --> 10:09.695
very different approaches
to our recreational time.

10:09.728 --> 10:12.741
Yes. See? That is great stakeout banter.

10:12.780 --> 10:16.233
Check us out, just two odd-couple,
buddy-cop knucklebutts

10:16.296 --> 10:18.257
camped out in a van, razzing each other

10:18.288 --> 10:20.032
while we eagle-eye some dirtbags.

10:20.087 --> 10:21.389
Enh! That's right.

10:25.411 --> 10:26.478
Are you okay?

10:26.511 --> 10:27.781
Your phone need juice?

10:27.814 --> 10:29.549
I have...

10:29.582 --> 10:31.284
seven different chargers,

10:31.316 --> 10:33.118
none of them for contemporary phones,

10:33.197 --> 10:34.383
but we could cobble something together.

10:34.453 --> 10:36.088
It's Sharon.

10:36.305 --> 10:39.793
She sent me her sonogram.

10:39.825 --> 10:41.937
It's a girl.

10:42.456 --> 10:46.628
Beautiful, healthy,
well-positioned girl.

10:48.353 --> 10:49.621
Rory's little sister.

10:51.962 --> 10:53.831
I think I'm ready to talk about
how I'm really feeling.

10:53.856 --> 10:55.325
Oh, yeah, that sounds about right.

10:55.364 --> 10:56.994
- Okay.
- Come here.

10:58.061 --> 10:59.629
Poppy's got ya.

11:03.966 --> 11:05.769
I don't know how you can eat
while the twins are...

11:05.802 --> 11:07.336
disposing of the body.

11:07.370 --> 11:09.840
Well, I guess seeing you
fall off your high horse

11:09.873 --> 11:11.775
left me a bit peckish.

11:11.807 --> 11:14.912
"All I care about is
my daughter's moral compass."

11:14.945 --> 11:16.046
Ha! Bunk.

11:16.078 --> 11:17.513
You're bunk, Lollypop Boy.

11:17.547 --> 11:19.048
Yeah, that's right. I took it,

11:19.081 --> 11:20.683
and it sounds better
coming out of my mouth.

11:20.716 --> 11:21.851
I'm not judging.

11:21.884 --> 11:25.054
I'm just merely labeling your hypocrisy

11:25.087 --> 11:26.956
and thinking less of you for it.

11:26.990 --> 11:28.459
Fine. Do I enjoy

11:28.491 --> 11:30.360
being the father
of a high-achieving daughter?

11:30.393 --> 11:32.028
Of course.

11:32.062 --> 11:35.198
Do I have an 18-year plan
where she goes to Harvard

11:35.231 --> 11:38.101
but then eschews that for a
prestigious New York university

11:38.134 --> 11:40.561
to chase after the love
of her life, just like Felicity?

11:40.608 --> 11:41.697
I do.

11:41.738 --> 11:43.240
And do I sometimes picture myself

11:43.273 --> 11:44.483
with the Felicity haircut?

11:44.553 --> 11:46.442
You know, not the good one,
but the one everyone says is bad

11:46.475 --> 11:48.476
but I think I could pull off?

11:48.539 --> 11:50.622
It's really busy up there, isn't it?

11:50.647 --> 11:52.116
Look, can you help us or not?

11:52.148 --> 11:53.616
Yes, I can help you.

11:53.649 --> 11:54.898
Sophie!

11:57.653 --> 12:01.057
Listen, it's time to construct
the perfect alibi,

12:01.091 --> 12:05.129
but the key is that you have to
really believe your own story.

12:05.162 --> 12:06.463
Okay? You got it?

12:06.495 --> 12:08.164
I-I think so.

12:08.197 --> 12:09.466
Okay.

12:09.499 --> 12:10.801
Where were you at 3:00 P.M.?

12:10.834 --> 12:13.637
Th-The mall?

12:13.669 --> 12:15.238
Baloney!

12:15.272 --> 12:18.609
Now, close your eyes
and see the store you're in.

12:18.642 --> 12:20.844
Feel it. Smell it.

12:20.876 --> 12:22.345
Okay.

12:22.402 --> 12:24.048
I was in Claire's.

12:24.087 --> 12:25.481
No! TCBY.

12:25.514 --> 12:27.451
And what did you buy?

12:27.484 --> 12:28.853
Homework?

12:31.120 --> 12:32.622
At a yogurt store?

12:32.655 --> 12:34.290
Okay, see, your head's not in the game.

12:34.323 --> 12:35.492
Take a lap!

12:37.193 --> 12:39.629
All right, give it to me straight.
She's gonna blow this, right?

12:39.663 --> 12:41.632
She's the worst liar I've ever seen.

12:41.664 --> 12:43.466
And kids are usually good at it.

12:43.499 --> 12:45.635
They're dumb enough to believe
what they're saying.

12:45.668 --> 12:47.703
Damn it, I raised too good
of a daughter.

12:47.736 --> 12:50.022
But at least we have all weekend
to figure it out.

12:52.835 --> 12:53.943
Will Cooper.

12:53.976 --> 12:55.749
The Hilltop parrot is missing.

12:55.796 --> 12:57.014
I assume it was Sophie.

12:57.047 --> 12:59.483
Thus, I am here on Friday afternoon

12:59.515 --> 13:01.985
of my three-day weekend to investigate.

13:02.018 --> 13:03.052
Why do you hate me?

13:07.057 --> 13:10.793
It just feels impossible
to wrap my head around the idea

13:10.826 --> 13:13.663
of Rory having a sibling
that isn't my kid.

13:13.696 --> 13:16.667
And Sharon can tell me to
kiss her belly all she wants to,

13:16.700 --> 13:18.969
but the truth is,
I'm not a part of this, Ang.

13:19.001 --> 13:20.636
And Rory will be.

13:20.669 --> 13:22.972
Yeah, that's gotta be
really hard to process.

13:23.005 --> 13:25.408
Especially with Sharon
sending you pictures

13:25.442 --> 13:27.476
of her gross new body roommate.

13:27.509 --> 13:28.912
Ugh.

13:28.945 --> 13:31.480
Sorry, all babies are miracles.
Proof of God.

13:31.514 --> 13:34.051
And it's not like I can confront
Sharon and tell her how I feel.

13:34.084 --> 13:35.919
No, I have to be the perfect ex-wife.

13:35.951 --> 13:38.321
Gracious, evolved, always has gum.

13:38.355 --> 13:40.757
I'm not allowed to get upset,
and sometimes I wanna get upset.

13:40.789 --> 13:43.192
Well, then, do it. Get upset.

13:43.225 --> 13:44.561
Come on. Let it out.

13:44.594 --> 13:45.996
Let it out on these losers.

13:46.028 --> 13:48.932
Ugh, kissing in the window,

13:48.965 --> 13:52.436
like they're the leg lamp
from that Christmas movie.

13:52.469 --> 13:54.371
Hell yeah. Let's go bust some skulls!

13:54.403 --> 13:56.240
Yeah, let's go show them
what a real kiss looks like!

13:56.273 --> 13:57.673
Yeah! Wait.

13:57.706 --> 13:58.908
What do you think
we're about to do, Angie?

14:01.711 --> 14:04.214
Okay, so, we need a plan
so they open the door.

14:04.246 --> 14:05.414
Do you have an air horn?

14:05.447 --> 14:07.083
What? No, I'm not
a morning radio deejay.

14:07.116 --> 14:08.217
I do not have an air horn.

14:08.250 --> 14:10.620
Angie? Poppy? Uh...

14:10.653 --> 14:12.088
- Who are you?
- Your worst nightmare.

14:12.121 --> 14:14.423
Yeah, your worst nightmare,
you hot biatch!

14:14.456 --> 14:15.958
Who do you guys think you are?

14:15.991 --> 14:18.094
You, cheating on Miggy? Really?

14:18.128 --> 14:19.730
I should bust you over the head
with Angie's spyglass.

14:19.763 --> 14:20.998
No, Poppy! I earned this.

14:22.113 --> 14:24.309
You kids do whatever you want
without any regard

14:24.334 --> 14:26.111
for the boundaries
we've agreed on as a society.

14:26.143 --> 14:28.279
- Poppy...
- You just invite people to your ultrasound

14:28.304 --> 14:29.805
and force-confront them
with your baby's sex,

14:29.839 --> 14:31.635
never considering how that
might be making them feel!

14:31.721 --> 14:33.543
- What's that, now?
- Uh, Pop, you're veering.

14:33.576 --> 14:34.644
I hear it. I'm bringing it home.

14:34.677 --> 14:36.279
- You...
- Poppy!

14:36.312 --> 14:38.749
I thought I heard
your scary, scoldy mom voice.

14:38.782 --> 14:39.950
What are you guys doing here?

14:39.983 --> 14:41.551
What are you doing here?

14:41.584 --> 14:43.654
Oh, you know my girlfriend, Homily.

14:43.687 --> 14:46.456
And this is Brian, our boyfriend.

14:47.423 --> 14:50.526
- Ohhhhhh.
- Ohhhhhh.

14:53.028 --> 14:55.791
We were just barging in 'cause...

14:57.033 --> 14:58.752
...Angie's got to use your toilet.

14:58.799 --> 15:01.241
- It's a diarrhea thing.
- Dude, seriously. Why?

15:03.693 --> 15:07.589
Okay, so the three of you
are dating each other?

15:07.652 --> 15:09.371
Yeah, we're a throuple.

15:09.396 --> 15:11.144
I've never been happier.

15:11.169 --> 15:12.909
I-I-I call my mom now.

15:13.003 --> 15:14.571
I don't know how that relates.

15:15.672 --> 15:18.575
Dang. Y'all are cheesin' hard.

15:18.609 --> 15:20.511
Miggy, did I even know you dated guys?

15:20.543 --> 15:21.845
No, you've met his boyfriends before.

15:21.878 --> 15:23.180
Remember Chubby Mario Lopez?

15:23.213 --> 15:24.482
Yeah, if you're confused,

15:24.514 --> 15:27.050
he looked exactly like
Mario Lopez but chubby.

15:27.084 --> 15:29.338
Oh, yeah, he was dope.

15:29.371 --> 15:30.695
Okay, I guess I did know.

15:30.720 --> 15:34.090
Sorry, this old brain basket of
mine's got a lot of holes in it.

15:34.123 --> 15:35.258
It's all good, bro.

15:35.291 --> 15:37.117
I don't really dig labels.

15:37.142 --> 15:38.947
It's just more of the vibe for me.

15:38.993 --> 15:41.368
And right now, I'm vibin' double.

15:46.486 --> 15:48.204
- Angie, no.
- What, I can't wink?

15:48.243 --> 15:49.356
You are not part of the group.

15:50.390 --> 15:51.592
I have a question.

15:51.625 --> 15:53.127
Sorry to sound like the old Millennial,

15:53.160 --> 15:54.862
but how does this work?

15:54.895 --> 15:56.698
Anybody ever feel left out or...?

15:56.731 --> 15:58.165
We have a three-pronged approach

15:58.198 --> 15:59.700
for working through the sticky stuff...

15:59.733 --> 16:02.336
radical honesty, active listening,

16:02.370 --> 16:04.472
and open communication.

16:04.505 --> 16:06.006
And it just works.

16:06.039 --> 16:08.476
Well, now I want to be in a throuple!

16:08.509 --> 16:10.211
How did you guys meet?

16:10.244 --> 16:13.148
Oh, there's a poly dating app.
It's called Big Bed.

16:13.180 --> 16:14.549
And, Brian, you're on it?

16:17.050 --> 16:18.385
Okay.

16:18.419 --> 16:21.655
Sophie Cooper,
at 3:00 P.M. this afternoon,

16:21.688 --> 16:24.858
I was crawling into my indoor hammock,

16:24.891 --> 16:27.861
firing up an audiobook
on self-compassion.

16:27.895 --> 16:29.997
I had just put down my cat for a nap.

16:30.030 --> 16:31.632
Okay.

16:31.665 --> 16:35.869
- Where were you at that time?
- I was shopping

16:35.903 --> 16:39.574
at the center for... shopping?

16:45.346 --> 16:48.082
The Eagle Rock mall.
First floor. Claire's.

16:48.116 --> 16:49.417
By yourself?

16:49.449 --> 16:51.919
No, Douglas took me
with Emma and Amy after school,

16:51.952 --> 16:54.422
and then he brought me home,
which is why he's here now.

16:54.454 --> 16:55.356
Next question.

16:57.239 --> 16:58.474
My God, she's doing it.

16:58.542 --> 17:00.042
She's good at lying.

17:00.097 --> 17:03.030
We did it.
We destroyed her inner conscience.

17:03.064 --> 17:05.233
Now there's no stopping her.

17:05.266 --> 17:07.935
May be time to break out
that Harvard bumper sticker.

17:07.969 --> 17:09.369
Though, I can tell you one thing,

17:09.403 --> 17:12.290
can't hold a damn candle
to SUNY Buffalo.

17:12.353 --> 17:14.118
Did you purchase anything?

17:14.190 --> 17:15.592
Yes, two scrunchies

17:15.617 --> 17:17.853
and a towel with a drawing
of a muscled body on it.

17:17.886 --> 17:19.855
My dad loves joke towels.

17:21.156 --> 17:23.759
All right.

17:23.791 --> 17:25.859
Seems like you have your story straight.

17:25.894 --> 17:27.996
Don't know what to do now.

17:28.029 --> 17:29.798
Got no leads.

17:29.831 --> 17:32.434
Sounds like another
A-plus weekend for old Yarbs.

17:32.466 --> 17:35.469
Well, 62 bad years under my belt.

17:35.503 --> 17:37.505
What's one more?

17:37.539 --> 17:38.864
Yeah, it's my birthday.

17:40.574 --> 17:42.276
Thanks, Dad.

17:42.310 --> 17:45.193
Man, now that I've lost
that pesky moral-compass thing,

17:45.224 --> 17:48.716
let's fill up that Sophie shelf
until it explodes!

17:48.750 --> 17:51.720
I'm riding these hollow insides
to the top.

17:51.753 --> 17:54.856
Wait! Vice Principal Yarble!

17:54.888 --> 17:56.457
You're screaming. I'm right here.

17:56.491 --> 17:58.440
Sophie's lying, but I-I told her to lie.

17:58.465 --> 18:00.588
- It's my fault.
- Dad, no!

18:00.613 --> 18:02.363
No, I led her astray.

18:02.397 --> 18:04.032
We should never have tried
to cover this up.

18:04.064 --> 18:05.966
The truth is, yes,
she stole the bird, okay?

18:06.000 --> 18:08.056
But only because she was
following her conscience.

18:08.119 --> 18:10.805
Dad! We were getting away with it.

18:10.830 --> 18:12.740
Yeah, but at what cost, bud?

18:12.773 --> 18:16.177
You have such a great heart,
and you should always follow it.

18:16.211 --> 18:18.080
Consequences be damned.

18:18.112 --> 18:20.866
Who cares if I only have Felicity's
curly hair in my dreams?

18:22.050 --> 18:24.319
Look, the only crime was her lie,

18:24.351 --> 18:25.920
and I told her to do that.

18:25.954 --> 18:28.690
So if you're gonna
blame anybody, blame me.

18:28.723 --> 18:29.991
Okay. I will blame you.

18:30.023 --> 18:31.525
- Oh, thank God.
- And her.

18:31.559 --> 18:32.860
What? But... But she didn't do anything.

18:32.894 --> 18:34.429
She didn't even mean to kill the bird.

18:34.462 --> 18:35.831
The bird's dead?!

18:35.863 --> 18:37.365
Okay, well, now you're screaming.

18:38.567 --> 18:42.904
Look, both of us will accept
any punishment coming our way.

18:42.936 --> 18:44.872
And what was your part in all this?

18:44.906 --> 18:46.207
Oh, nothing.

18:46.241 --> 18:48.577
Just hanging with my buds.

18:50.477 --> 18:52.214
Deed's done. Time to settle up.

18:52.246 --> 18:55.142
We can charge by hour
or by weight of the remains.

18:56.368 --> 18:58.052
My girls don't leave prints, Yarble.

18:58.086 --> 19:00.222
You'll never be able to prove anything.

19:02.223 --> 19:03.466
Happy birthday.

19:04.825 --> 19:07.695
That throuple seemed so happy

19:07.728 --> 19:09.930
and supportive of each other.

19:09.964 --> 19:12.434
Are youths... smart?

19:12.466 --> 19:15.137
Did Miggy just teach me
something about relationships?

19:15.169 --> 19:17.471
Did Brian have the bluest eyes
you've ever seen?

19:17.504 --> 19:19.140
- Huh?
- I'm sorry.

19:19.174 --> 19:21.743
I thought we were just
asking questions about the day.

19:21.775 --> 19:23.410
I can't believe that I'm gonna say this,

19:23.444 --> 19:25.647
but maybe you should...

19:25.679 --> 19:27.815
try the three-pronged approach
with Sharon.

19:27.849 --> 19:29.618
You know, the more honest you are,

19:29.650 --> 19:31.085
the easier this will all be.

19:31.119 --> 19:33.155
Wow.

19:33.187 --> 19:35.145
That's good advice.

19:37.145 --> 19:40.895
I can't believe Rory's about to
have a little sister.

19:40.989 --> 19:42.911
It's actually pretty cool.

19:43.031 --> 19:43.932
Yeah.

19:45.265 --> 19:47.268
Hey, thanks for
getting me through tonight.

19:47.302 --> 19:48.602
Yeah.

19:48.636 --> 19:50.571
Oh, my God. I did it.

19:50.604 --> 19:52.506
Am I... Poppy?

19:52.540 --> 19:54.909
Well, real Poppy wouldn't have
ran out of gas on the way home.

19:54.943 --> 19:57.542
But... yeah, you did it.

19:58.729 --> 20:00.081
Great.

20:02.191 --> 20:04.476
So in another news, I'm already
killing it on Big Bed.

20:04.526 --> 20:05.787
Okay.

20:08.952 --> 20:10.619
Pete looks different.

20:10.653 --> 20:12.823
Nah, he just missed us.

20:12.856 --> 20:14.061
How was your weekend, Pete?

20:14.112 --> 20:16.949
Welcome to Toyota of Lancaster.

20:16.974 --> 20:18.743
It's the same bird. Move along.

20:20.643 --> 20:22.445
Why is there so much trash
on the ground?

20:22.478 --> 20:23.899
Why is everything so wet?

20:25.282 --> 20:27.618
Dad, I'm sorry
we won't be celebrating me

20:27.650 --> 20:29.119
as Student of the Year.

20:29.151 --> 20:32.224
Well, it turns out
I'm not really a maroon guy,

20:32.249 --> 20:34.058
and it was a Zara off-the-rack suit,

20:34.083 --> 20:35.347
so super baggy in the butt.

20:35.372 --> 20:37.227
Probably best if I don't wear it at all.

20:37.259 --> 20:38.828
And I'm really proud of you.

20:38.862 --> 20:40.229
And I'm proud of you, too.

20:40.263 --> 20:42.967
Mostly for becoming
a sociopath-level liar

20:42.999 --> 20:44.500
in one afternoon.

20:44.534 --> 20:46.804
And also for standing up
for what you believe in.

20:46.836 --> 20:49.006
Ooh. I want to show you this.

20:49.038 --> 20:50.140
Huh?

20:50.172 --> 20:51.674
Is that you?

20:51.708 --> 20:54.111
Yeah. I fought for a cause or two.

20:54.143 --> 20:57.204
After all, I was a child of the '70s.

20:57.229 --> 20:58.983
- 1870s.
- Hey-oh!

20:59.015 --> 21:00.351
Boys!

21:00.383 --> 21:03.987
Okay, look, the point is,
kids are dumb dreamers,

21:04.021 --> 21:07.157
but, you know, maybe that phase
is good for something, huh?

21:07.189 --> 21:10.026
Wow. That was almost touching.
Thanks, Douglas.

21:10.060 --> 21:11.362
Since when did the kids
get so comfortable

21:11.394 --> 21:13.029
calling me by my first name?

21:13.063 --> 21:14.598
Back to work.

21:14.631 --> 21:16.788
Special reward
if anyone finds my retainer.

21:18.482 --> 21:19.917
Yes, Ms. Yarble.

21:19.959 --> 21:21.769
Don't do that.

21:21.839 --> 21:26.839
