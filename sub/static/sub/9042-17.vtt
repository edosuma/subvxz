WEBVTT

00:01.167 --> 00:02.633
- NO, NO.
LISTEN TO ME. LISTEN TO ME.

00:02.633 --> 00:04.567
THE PROBLEM,
IT'S WITH YOUR SATELLITE.

00:04.567 --> 00:06.633
I WAS--I WAS
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOVIE,

00:06.633 --> 00:08.567
AND IT WENT OUT
FOR 23 MINUTES,

00:08.567 --> 00:10.600
AND NOW I MISSED
THE MIDDLE OF THE MOVIE,

00:10.600 --> 00:13.700
AND THE ENDING,
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

00:13.700 --> 00:16.633
LIKE, WHO THE HELL IS THAT GUY?

00:18.100 --> 00:19.167
- HI!

00:19.167 --> 00:20.400
- WAIT!

00:20.400 --> 00:21.700
YES, YES.
IT'S BACK ON RIGHT NOW.

00:21.700 --> 00:23.233
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

00:23.233 --> 00:24.300
I--

00:24.300 --> 00:25.400
OH, LOOK AT THIS.

00:25.400 --> 00:29.000
WHY IS SHE SHOOTING HIM?

00:29.000 --> 00:31.433
THEY WERE IN LOVE!

00:31.433 --> 00:33.067
JUST--

00:33.067 --> 00:34.067
FORGET ABOUT IT.

00:34.067 --> 00:35.600
MY WHOLE EVENING IS RUINED.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.067
OKAY, THANK YOU.

00:37.067 --> 00:39.533
[groans]
BUNCH OF DRUNKS.

00:41.733 --> 00:45.033
- ANOTHER STRESSFUL NIGHT
OF WATCHING TV, RAY.

00:45.033 --> 00:46.467
- IT'S NOT FUNNY.

00:46.467 --> 00:49.000
I WAS EMOTIONALLY HOOKED.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.067
- OH, HONEY.

00:51.067 --> 00:53.567
- WHAT ARE YOU
SO HAPPY ABOUT?

00:53.567 --> 00:55.400
- NOTHING. WE HAD A GREAT NIGHT
AT OUR CHURCH MEETING.

00:55.400 --> 00:56.667
IT WAS ALL ABOUT SIGNING UP

00:56.667 --> 00:58.433
FOR DIFFERENT
COMMUNITY SERVICES.

00:58.433 --> 01:00.333
- OH, GOD.

01:00.333 --> 01:02.400
- I SIGNED UP
FOR A COUPLE OF THINGS.

01:02.400 --> 01:05.067
- OH, OKAY.
SO WE'RE COVERED.

01:05.067 --> 01:06.733
- AND I THOUGHT
IT MIGHT BE NICE

01:06.733 --> 01:09.467
IF YOU WOULD VOLUNTEER
TO HELP SOME PEOPLE IN NEED.

01:09.467 --> 01:12.367
- THAT'S NOT REALLY
MY THING.

01:12.367 --> 01:14.200
- YOU MIGHT WANT
TO MAKE IT YOUR THING,

01:14.200 --> 01:16.567
BECAUSE
I SIGNED YOU UP TOO.

01:16.567 --> 01:18.367
- WHAT?

01:18.367 --> 01:20.233
- YEAH, ONE HOUR A WEEK
AT ST. THERESA'S HOSPITAL.

01:20.233 --> 01:23.000
- AN HOUR?

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
- YES, THIS IS ABOUT
GIVING YOUR TIME,

01:25.000 --> 01:26.400
GETTING INVOLVED.

01:26.400 --> 01:29.667
- LOOK,
I'LL WRITE 'EM A CHECK.

01:29.667 --> 01:31.700
- NO, RAY,
IT'S NOT ABOUT MONEY.

01:31.700 --> 01:32.733
- OH, NO?

01:32.733 --> 01:34.533
LISTEN, MONEY TALKS,

01:34.533 --> 01:37.333
AND WE ALL KNOW
WHAT WALKS, OKAY?

01:37.333 --> 01:40.567
BELIEVE ME, THEY'LL BE
VERY HAPPY WITH MY $20.

01:40.567 --> 01:42.433
- ALL RIGHT,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:42.433 --> 01:44.333
JUST FORGET IT.

01:46.300 --> 01:48.667
- YOU SEE? THIS IS WHAT
I DON'T LIKE ABOUT CHARITIES.

01:48.667 --> 01:51.000
IT'S ALL ABOUT MAKING
PEOPLE FEEL GUILTY.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.700
- WHAT? WHAT DID I DO?

01:52.700 --> 01:54.400
I'M NOT TRYING
TO MAKE YOU FEEL GUILTY.

01:54.400 --> 01:56.167
I ASKED YOU TO VOLUNTEER
FOR SOMETHING.

01:56.167 --> 01:57.200
YOU REFUSED.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.600
YOUR GUILT IS YOUR OWN.

02:02.133 --> 02:05.200
- YOU KNOW HOW TO WORK IT.

02:06.300 --> 02:07.733
- LOOK, RAY,

02:07.733 --> 02:09.467
ALL I'M SAYING IS
THAT I JUST REALLY LOVE

02:09.467 --> 02:11.367
THE CHARITIES
THAT I'M INVOLVED WITH,

02:11.367 --> 02:13.367
AND I FEEL LIKE
WE HAVE A LOT,

02:13.367 --> 02:15.533
AND I REALLY ENJOY
GIVING SOMETHING BACK.

02:15.533 --> 02:18.233
I MEAN,
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE DO.

02:18.233 --> 02:21.333
- NO, THEY DON'T!

02:21.333 --> 02:22.667
- ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:22.667 --> 02:24.467
I'M NOT GONNA
ARGUE WITH YOU.

02:24.467 --> 02:26.200
IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO VOLUNTEER AT THE HOSPITAL,

02:26.200 --> 02:27.667
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

02:27.667 --> 02:31.167
THIS IS
BETWEEN YOU AND HIM.

02:35.167 --> 02:37.433
- OH, YOU ARE SHAMELESS!

02:39.367 --> 02:40.633
DON'T--

02:40.633 --> 02:42.300
DON'T BRING HIM INTO IT,
OKAY?

02:42.300 --> 02:45.000
THAT'S NOT GOING TO
WORK WITH ME.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.033
[scoffs]

02:48.033 --> 02:50.067
TAKE IT BACK!

03:09.467 --> 03:10.767
HI.

03:10.767 --> 03:14.633
HI, UH,
I'M HERE TO VOLUNTEER.

03:14.633 --> 03:16.667
- OH, ARE YOU
WITH THE CHURCH PROGRAM?

03:16.667 --> 03:18.400
- YEAH.
YEAH, RAY BARONE.

03:18.400 --> 03:19.767
I SIGNED UP 'CAUSE...

03:19.767 --> 03:23.433
THAT'S WHAT I'M ALL ABOUT.

03:23.433 --> 03:25.567
- GREAT. IF YOU'LL
JUST SIGN THESE PAPERS.

03:25.567 --> 03:28.967
- HERE'S SOME TYPE "O"
FOR THE FRIDGE.

03:40.667 --> 03:43.200
- SIR?
SIR, YOU OKAY?

03:43.200 --> 03:45.367
- YES, I'M OKAY.
I'M ALL RIGHT.

03:45.367 --> 03:46.433
I'M FINE.

03:46.433 --> 03:48.333
- WHAT'S WITH HIM?

03:48.333 --> 03:51.067
- HE'S HERE TO HELP OUT.

03:52.167 --> 03:54.400
- OHH.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.667
- LET'S PUT
THESE THINGS AWAY.

03:56.667 --> 03:57.967
- OKAY.

03:59.167 --> 04:02.567
- HERE, SIT DOWN.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.700
TAKE A BREATH.

04:06.700 --> 04:08.767
BREATHE THROUGH YOUR MOUTH.

04:08.767 --> 04:12.533
- YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO VOLUNTEER IN A HOSPITAL?

04:12.533 --> 04:14.500
- YEAH, I'M FINE.

04:14.500 --> 04:15.567
OHH.

04:15.567 --> 04:17.533
I'M OKAY.

04:17.533 --> 04:20.400
- HEY, ARE YOU RAY BARONE,
THE SPORTSWRITER?

04:20.400 --> 04:23.000
- YEAH, YEAH.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.133
- AND YOU'VE NEVER
SEEN BLOOD BEFORE?

04:27.233 --> 04:30.467
- SURE.
JUST NOT "TO GO."

04:32.567 --> 04:34.700
LOOK, UH...

04:34.700 --> 04:36.633
I'M ALL RIGHT,
THOUGH, NOW.

04:36.633 --> 04:38.500
- ARE YOU SURE?
- YEAH, NO.

04:38.500 --> 04:40.533
I'M TOTALLY FINE,
AND I WANT TO VOLUNTEER,

04:40.533 --> 04:43.200
SO...
SO, UH, WHAT DO I DO?

04:43.200 --> 04:45.467
- YOU KNOW
MRS. GORMAN IN 408?

04:45.467 --> 04:47.167
MAYBE HE COULD
HELP OUT WITH HER.

04:47.167 --> 04:50.200
- I THINK SHE ALREADY KNOWS
HOW TO FALL DOWN.

04:51.400 --> 04:53.333
- NO, SHE LIKES BASEBALL.

04:53.333 --> 04:54.733
HE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO TALK ABOUT SPORTS,

04:54.733 --> 04:56.067
CHEER HER UP,

04:56.067 --> 04:57.533
GET HER
TO TAKE HER PILLS.

04:57.533 --> 04:59.633
SHE'S KIND OF
A LONELY OLD LADY.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.367
YOU WANT TO TRY IT?

05:01.367 --> 05:03.167
- YEAH, OKAY. SURE.

05:03.167 --> 05:07.000
SO JUST TALK TO HER
AND TELL HER TO TAKE HER PILLS?

05:07.000 --> 05:08.567
- YEAH.

05:10.367 --> 05:12.467
- OKAY.

05:12.467 --> 05:13.600
RIGHT IN THERE?

05:13.600 --> 05:15.567
- YEAH.

05:16.767 --> 05:19.500
- OKAY.

05:19.500 --> 05:22.533
SHE'S NOT BLEEDING,
IS SHE?

05:22.533 --> 05:25.500
- WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST WRITE A CHECK?

05:37.700 --> 05:40.000
[clears throat]

05:57.133 --> 06:00.433
- IF YOU THE ANGEL OF DEATH,
I'M READY.

06:04.333 --> 06:06.500
- NO. NO.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.667
NO, NO. I'M NOT
THE ANGEL OF DEATH.

06:08.667 --> 06:11.233
- THEN YOU COULD USE A MINT.

06:18.233 --> 06:20.000
- SORRY. I'M SORRY.

06:21.467 --> 06:26.400
I'M RAY.
I'M HELPING OUT HERE TODAY.

06:29.267 --> 06:32.533
SO I HEAR
YOU LIKE BASEBALL.

06:32.533 --> 06:35.167
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:35.167 --> 06:37.000
- I'M RAY BARONE.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.633
I'M A SPORTSWRITER
FOR NEW YORK NEWSDAY.

06:38.633 --> 06:42.167
- OH, YEAH?
CAN YOU FIX A RADIO?

06:43.233 --> 06:44.333
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

06:44.333 --> 06:46.433
- WHAT DO YOU THINK IT MEANS

06:46.433 --> 06:50.000
WHEN SOMEBODY SAYS
THEY NEED THEIR RADIO FIXED?

06:53.400 --> 06:55.600
- NO, I'VE COME HERE
TO JUST TALK TO YOU--

06:55.600 --> 06:57.400
YOU KNOW, CHEER YOU UP.

06:57.400 --> 07:01.967
- THEY FINALLY SEND
A MAN IN HERE, AND IT'S YOU.

07:03.567 --> 07:05.367
- ALL RIGHT,
LISTEN, MRS. GORMAN,

07:05.367 --> 07:06.733
I WAS JUST SEEING IF

07:06.733 --> 07:08.733
MAYBE I COULD GET YOU
TO TAKE YOUR PILLS.

07:08.733 --> 07:11.467
- FIX MY RADIO,
I'LL TAKE A PILL.

07:11.467 --> 07:13.600
- I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO FIX A RADIO.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.667
- THEN YOU'VE USED UP
WHAT'S LEFT OF MY LIFE

07:15.667 --> 07:17.600
FOR NOTHING.

07:22.633 --> 07:24.267
- OKAY, THEN.

07:24.267 --> 07:28.033
WELL, NICE
TALKING TO YOU, MA'AM.

07:29.300 --> 07:31.067
- YOU SIT
IN THE PRESS BOX?

07:32.300 --> 07:35.067
- WHAT, AT THE GAME?
YEAH.

07:35.067 --> 07:38.467
- I'VE NEVER SAT
IN A PRESS BOX BEFORE.

07:40.633 --> 07:45.433
- WELL, UM, IF YOU WANT
TO SIT IN A PRESS BOX,

07:45.433 --> 07:47.733
YOU'VE GOT TO GET BETTER.

07:47.733 --> 07:50.567
AND IF YOU WANT
TO GET BETTER...

07:50.567 --> 07:53.033
YOU'VE GOT
TO TAKE YOUR PILLS.

07:54.533 --> 07:58.267
- OH, YOU TRICKY,
TRICKY WHITE BOY.

08:07.367 --> 08:09.367
- OKAY, GOT YOUR NEW PLUNGER.

08:09.367 --> 08:10.700
- OH, THANKS, ROBERT.

08:10.700 --> 08:12.533
MICHAEL FLUSHED
AN ACTION FIGURE.

08:12.533 --> 08:14.567
- WHAT ARE YOU
FEEDING THAT KID?

08:18.333 --> 08:19.567
SO WHERE'S RAY?

08:19.567 --> 08:21.533
- AT THE HOSPITAL AGAIN.

08:21.533 --> 08:23.733
HE'S UP TO THREE NIGHTS A WEEK.
HE'S A BIG HIT THERE.

08:23.733 --> 08:26.633
I GUESS 'CAUSE HE WRITES
FOR NEWSDAY, HE'S A CELEBRITY.

08:26.633 --> 08:29.233
- YEAH? WHAT IS IT,
A MENTAL HOSPITAL?

08:31.467 --> 08:33.067
- NO, YOU KNOW, IT'S NICE.

08:33.067 --> 08:34.500
IT'S JUST THAT
HE'S GONE ALL THE TIME.

08:34.500 --> 08:37.067
- SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
YOU MISS HIM?

08:37.067 --> 08:40.300
- YEAH, WHEN I NEED
THE TOILET PLUNGED.

08:40.300 --> 08:43.000
- DID RAYMOND GET BACK YET?
I'VE GOT RAVIOLI.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.067
- AND I'VE GOT
MY STRETCHY PANTS ON.

08:49.133 --> 08:50.267
- MARIE, WHY DID YOU MAKE
RAVIOLI?

08:50.267 --> 08:52.267
I WAS GOING TO COOK.

08:52.267 --> 08:54.333
- OH, I JUST THOUGHT RAYMOND
SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING NICE.

08:56.567 --> 08:59.467
RAYMOND'S DOING SUCH GOOD THINGS
AT THE HOSPITAL.

08:59.467 --> 09:01.500
LEE'S NEPHEW NEEDED A CAST,

09:01.500 --> 09:03.767
AND RAYMOND CHEERED HIM UP

09:03.767 --> 09:06.633
BY BLOWING UP
A SURGICAL GLOVE.

09:06.633 --> 09:09.700
CAN YOU IMAGINE?

09:09.700 --> 09:12.067
- HE'S A GENIUS!

09:14.533 --> 09:16.000
- HEY.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.633
- HI, RAYMOND.
- HOW'S IT GOING?

09:17.633 --> 09:19.567
- HE'S HERE.
LET'S EAT.

09:19.567 --> 09:21.233
- RAYMOND,

09:21.233 --> 09:24.367
LEE TOLD ME ABOUT
YOUR WONDERFUL GLOVE TRICK.

09:24.367 --> 09:27.500
- YEAH, I'M A TRICKY,
TRICKY WHITE BOY.

09:32.667 --> 09:35.033
HEY, LOOK
WHAT THEY GAVE ME.

09:35.033 --> 09:37.167
- "AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL"?

09:37.167 --> 09:39.133
- THAT'S RIGHT.
I CAN GO ANYWHERE.

09:39.133 --> 09:41.200
AND IF I'M
EXPOSED TO RADIATION,

09:41.200 --> 09:42.733
THIS CHANGES COLOR.

09:42.733 --> 09:44.233
- OHH!

09:44.233 --> 09:46.533
- YOU KNOW, I MAKE
SOME OF THE ROUNDS

09:46.533 --> 09:48.033
WITH SOME OF THE NURSES.

09:48.033 --> 09:50.000
I GIVE THEM
A FEW HUMOROUS ANECDOTES.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.367
THEY EVEN SAID

09:51.367 --> 09:53.000
I COULD ENTERTAIN
IN THE GERIATRIC WARD.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.267
- YOU'RE PRACTICALLY
A DOCTOR!

09:56.267 --> 09:58.267
- YEAH, MA, YOU CAN EITHER
GO TO MEDICAL SCHOOL

09:58.267 --> 10:01.067
OR BLOW UP A GLOVE.

10:01.067 --> 10:02.467
- TURNS OUT I'VE GOT

10:02.467 --> 10:04.333
KIND OF A TOUCH
WITH THE PATIENTS, YOU KNOW?

10:04.333 --> 10:05.733
I'VE HAD A LOT OF PRACTICE

10:05.733 --> 10:07.533
DEALING WITH
DIFFICULT PERSONALITIES.

10:07.533 --> 10:10.567
- YES, HE HAS.

10:10.567 --> 10:13.000
- I ALWAYS KNEW
YOU HAD IT IN YOU, RAYMOND,

10:13.000 --> 10:14.467
AND HERE IT IS.

10:14.467 --> 10:18.333
YOU'VE BLOSSOMED
INTO A HUMANITARIAN.

10:18.333 --> 10:21.667
- WOW.
GLAD I BROUGHT THIS.

10:24.133 --> 10:26.267
- HEY, RAY, THE NEXT TIME
YOU GO TO THE HOSPITAL,

10:26.267 --> 10:28.400
GET ME SOME OF THOSE
EXTRA-LONG Q-TIPS,

10:28.400 --> 10:31.733
THE KIND YOU CAN
REALLY CRANK ON.

10:31.733 --> 10:34.000
- I'M GONNA GET YOU
SOMETHING TO EAT, DEAR.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.733
IT'S TIME SOMEBODY
DID SOMETHING FOR YOU.

10:36.733 --> 10:38.233
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:38.233 --> 10:40.700
I SERVE THE PUBLIC
TOO, YOU KNOW, MA.

10:40.700 --> 10:43.300
- DON'T BRAG, ROBBIE.
IT'S NOT BECOMING.

10:45.433 --> 10:48.000
- WHEN ARE YOU GOING BACK THERE?
- THURSDAY.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.767
- RAY, THURSDAY?

10:49.767 --> 10:52.667
- YEAH, THEY WANT ME
TO DO A SPORTS TALK.

10:52.667 --> 10:55.467
- BUT THURSDAY I DO MY THING
AT THE HOMELESS SHELTER.

10:55.467 --> 10:57.700
- OH. WELL, MA,
CAN YOU BABYSIT?

10:57.700 --> 11:00.500
- I'D LOVE TO, DEAR,
BUT I HAVE MY FOLK DANCING.

11:03.733 --> 11:05.467
- WELL, I GOT AN IDEA.

11:05.467 --> 11:07.133
WHY DON'T YOU DO YOUR THING
ON ANOTHER NIGHT?

11:07.133 --> 11:08.433
- BECAUSE I'VE
MADE A COMMITMENT.

11:08.433 --> 11:10.333
- YEAH, BUT THIS IS
FOR THE HOSPITAL.

11:10.333 --> 11:12.767
- RIGHT, AND MY THING
IS FOR THE HOMELESS.

11:12.767 --> 11:16.200
- I'M HELPING SICK PEOPLE.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.567
- ARE YOU SAYING YOUR CHARITY'S
BETTER THAN MINE?

11:18.567 --> 11:22.533
- OH, YOU ARE
SO DISGUSTING!

11:22.533 --> 11:25.133
DEBRA IS THE REAL HUMANITARIAN
IN THIS FAMILY,

11:25.133 --> 11:26.433
AND EVERYBODY KNOWS

11:26.433 --> 11:29.033
THAT HOMELESS
KICKS HOSPITAL BUTT!

11:31.200 --> 11:33.567
- BUT RAYMOND'S DOING
VERY IMPORTANT WORK.

11:33.567 --> 11:35.233
- BUT DEBORAH'S BEEN
DOING HER CHARITY STUFF

11:35.233 --> 11:36.667
FOR A LONG TIME.

11:36.667 --> 11:39.033
RAYMOND'S JUST
A GOOD-DOER-COME-LATELY.

11:40.767 --> 11:42.333
- LISTEN, ROBERT,
HE SHOULD GO.

11:42.333 --> 11:44.200
I'M THE ONE THAT
WANTED HIM TO DO THIS,

11:44.200 --> 11:47.300
AND I'M GLAD HE GOT INVOLVED,
SO GO AHEAD, RAY.

11:47.300 --> 11:49.033
- REALLY? YEAH?

11:49.033 --> 11:52.033
- THE HOSPITAL WINS!

11:52.033 --> 11:54.300
AND WHO KNOWS HOW MANY
SPIRITS WILL BE LIFTED

11:54.300 --> 11:57.233
JUST BECAUSE
MY SON WAS THERE?

11:58.433 --> 12:01.133
YOU ARE A SON...

12:01.133 --> 12:04.100
[emotionally]
WHO TRULY SHINES!

12:05.733 --> 12:07.600
- [with feigned emotion]
AND SO IT IS MY HONOR

12:07.600 --> 12:10.267
TO PRESENT YOU
WITH THIS AWARD.

12:19.700 --> 12:21.367
- HEY, HOW'S IT GOING?

12:21.367 --> 12:24.933
- YOU CAN COME IN.
THERE'S NO BLOOD.

12:26.033 --> 12:27.633
- GOOD. GOOD.

12:27.633 --> 12:29.267
HEY.

12:29.267 --> 12:31.067
I THOUGHT I'D SEE
WHO'S IN THE LOUNGE

12:31.067 --> 12:32.767
AND MAYBE GIVE
A LITTLE TALK ABOUT BASEBALL.

12:32.767 --> 12:34.467
- OH, WELL, ACTUALLY,

12:34.467 --> 12:36.533
WE ALREADY HAVE
SOME ENTERTAINMENT FOR TONIGHT.

12:39.567 --> 12:42.100
- NOW, NOW,
TRAFFIC COP TIMMY.

12:42.100 --> 12:44.200
[chuckles]

12:44.200 --> 12:46.667
THE FOOD AT THE HOSPITAL
ISN'T THAT BAD.

12:46.667 --> 12:49.433
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S FIT FOR A KING.

12:49.433 --> 12:51.233
HERE, KING!
COME ON, BOY!

12:51.233 --> 12:53.100
HERE, BOY!
WHERE ARE YOU?

12:53.100 --> 12:54.633
- ALL RIGHT, TIMMY.

12:54.633 --> 12:56.467
[laughter]

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
- NOW, TIMMY,
THAT'S A LITTLE RUDE.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.333
THESE KIND PEOPLE DIDN'T
COME HERE TO GET INSULTED.

13:06.333 --> 13:09.767
- THEN MAYBE THEY SHOULD
CLOSE THEIR ROBES.

13:09.767 --> 13:13.733
[laughter]

13:13.733 --> 13:15.600
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:15.600 --> 13:18.400
- NOW, TIMMY, IT WON'T DO
TO HAVE YOU TALK LIKE THAT

13:18.400 --> 13:19.733
WHILE YOU'RE ON DUTY,

13:19.733 --> 13:22.033
SO LET ME
REMOVE YOUR BADGE.

13:22.033 --> 13:24.367
- GENTLE.
IT'S NAILED ON.

13:24.367 --> 13:27.333
I HOPE THE DOCTORS HERE
HAVE SOME WOOD GLUE.

13:27.333 --> 13:29.267
[laughter]

13:29.267 --> 13:31.100
- THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
IT'S NOT A WOOD PUPPET.

13:31.100 --> 13:32.300
- SHH!

13:32.300 --> 13:34.367
- ALL RIGHT.
NOW I CAN LOOSEN UP.

13:34.367 --> 13:37.100
HELLO, DOLL FACE.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

13:37.100 --> 13:41.033
- MARGARET.

13:41.033 --> 13:42.700
- YOU'RE A REAL LOOKER.

13:42.700 --> 13:45.300
MAYBE IF YOU BREAK YOUR HIP,
I CAN BE YOUR SPLINT.

13:45.300 --> 13:46.767
HA-CHA-CHA-CHA!

13:46.767 --> 13:49.133
- EASY, TIMMY!
I'M SORRY.

13:49.133 --> 13:52.600
- HE'S NOT WOOD.
HE'S MADE OF PLASTIC.

13:52.600 --> 13:54.200
- HEY, FOLKS,
WHAT DO YOU THINK

13:54.200 --> 13:56.167
THIS GUY'S DOING
IN THE HOSPITAL, HUH?

13:56.167 --> 13:57.300
PROBABLY DROPPED IN

13:57.300 --> 14:00.133
FOR AN EMERGENCY
NOSE REDUCTION.

14:00.133 --> 14:05.100
[laughter]

14:05.100 --> 14:06.767
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

14:06.767 --> 14:10.000
MY COUSIN PINOCCHIO!

14:10.000 --> 14:13.267
[laughter]

14:13.267 --> 14:15.267
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT!
GREAT SHOW!

14:15.267 --> 14:17.067
OFFICER BARONE
AND HIS PLASTIC PUPPET,

14:17.067 --> 14:18.500
EVERYBODY.

14:18.500 --> 14:20.300
YEAH, OKAY.
THANK YOU FOR FILLING IN.

14:20.300 --> 14:22.233
ALL RIGHT, HEY.

14:22.233 --> 14:23.767
WANT TO SEE SOMETHING FUNNY?

14:23.767 --> 14:27.033
I KNOW
WHAT TO DO WITH THIS.

14:28.733 --> 14:30.500
HEY, IT'S A BALLOON!

14:30.500 --> 14:34.133
WHOOP--IT'S A TURKEY!
GOBBLE GOBBLE GOBBLE!

14:34.133 --> 14:38.433
HEY, HEY, EVERYBODY,
I'M MILKING MYSELF.

14:40.700 --> 14:44.667
- BOO!

14:44.667 --> 14:48.233
- YES, MADAM,
I AGREE WITH YOU.

14:48.233 --> 14:51.367
THIS GUY'S ACT
IS A "DO NOT RESUSCITATE."

14:51.367 --> 14:52.700
[laughter]

14:58.467 --> 15:00.333
SO WHAT DOES A GUY
HAVE TO DO

15:00.333 --> 15:02.233
TO GET A SPONGE BATH
AROUND HERE?

15:04.100 --> 15:05.267
THANK YOU.
YOU'VE BEEN GREAT.

15:05.267 --> 15:07.667
REMEMBER TO TIP YOUR NURSES.

15:09.533 --> 15:11.267
[kids squealing]

15:11.267 --> 15:13.333
- IF YOU THREE
DON'T GO TO BED RIGHT NOW,

15:13.333 --> 15:15.700
I'M...JUST...

15:15.700 --> 15:17.667
OH, WHO CARES?

15:21.067 --> 15:24.000
- YOU KNOW WHAT ROBERT IS?

15:24.000 --> 15:25.367
HE'S A COMPETITIVE,
SELFISH,

15:25.367 --> 15:27.400
LITTLE, TINY,
PEA-BRAINED GIANT,

15:27.400 --> 15:29.733
AND A HACK!

15:29.733 --> 15:31.300
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

15:31.300 --> 15:33.133
- HE WAITED
TILL THERE WAS AN OPENING,

15:33.133 --> 15:35.367
THEN SNUCK INTO THE HOSPITAL
TO STEAL MY THUNDER.

15:35.367 --> 15:37.067
- WHY WAS ROBERT
AT THE HOSPITAL?

15:37.067 --> 15:38.667
- TO STEAL MY THUNDER!

15:38.667 --> 15:41.400
HE--HE COMES IN THERE

15:41.400 --> 15:43.233
WITH HIS IDIOTIC
LITTLE TIMMY DOLL

15:43.233 --> 15:45.133
AND HIS LAME JOKES

15:45.133 --> 15:46.600
AND HIS LIPS
MOVING ALL AROUND.

15:46.600 --> 15:48.667
[mocking Robert]
RAYMOND, WHAT, ARE YOU HERE FOR,

15:48.667 --> 15:51.100
YOUR EMERGENCY
NOSE REDUCTION?

15:51.100 --> 15:55.300
- [laughing]
TIMMY SAID THAT TO YOU?

15:55.300 --> 15:57.333
- IT'S NOT FUNNY.
IT'S STUPID.

15:57.333 --> 15:59.633
AND THEY WERE ALL
LAUGHING AT IT, ALL OF THEM--

15:59.633 --> 16:01.500
THE NURSES, THE PATIENTS--

16:01.500 --> 16:03.467
LIKE THE FUNNIEST THING
THEY EVER HEARD.

16:03.467 --> 16:05.267
IF THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT,
THEY CAN HAVE IT.

16:05.267 --> 16:07.333
I'M NOT GOING
BACK TO THAT PLACE.

16:07.333 --> 16:11.100
SAINT STUPID, STUPID HOSPITAL
FOR THE INCURABLY STUPID.

16:13.333 --> 16:14.767
- SO YOU'RE QUITTING?

16:14.767 --> 16:16.067
- YES. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

16:16.067 --> 16:17.700
THAT'S RIGHT.

16:19.767 --> 16:22.400
I QUIT.

16:22.400 --> 16:24.633
- WELL, IF YOU DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD GO BACK,

16:24.633 --> 16:25.733
THEN YOU SHOULDN'T GO.

16:25.733 --> 16:28.033
WELL, I DON'T, SO I WON'T!

16:28.033 --> 16:30.567
HE DOESN'T EVEN BOTHER

16:30.567 --> 16:32.633
TO DRESS THE DUMMY UP
LIKE A DOCTOR OR A NURSE.

16:32.633 --> 16:34.500
HE'S SUCH A HACK!

16:37.467 --> 16:38.633
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:38.633 --> 16:40.433
YOU PUT IN
SO MUCH TIME OVER THERE.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.300
YOU SHOULD JUST STAY HERE,
WHERE YOU'RE APPRECIATED.

16:42.300 --> 16:44.767
- DAMN STRAIGHT!

16:44.767 --> 16:47.767
- AS A MATTER OF FACT, YOU KNOW
WHAT I WOULD APPRECIATE?

16:47.767 --> 16:49.633
THE KIDS ARE STILL
RUNNING AROUND UPSTAIRS.

16:49.633 --> 16:52.667
COULD YOU GO
AND TIE THEM TO THEIR BEDS?

16:52.667 --> 16:55.233
- YEAH.
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

16:55.233 --> 16:57.367
- OH, AND TOMORROW NIGHT,
IF IT'S OKAY,

16:57.367 --> 16:59.533
AMY ASKED ME TO GO OUT
TO DINNER AND A MOVIE.

16:59.533 --> 17:03.667
- SO YOU'RE ALL RIGHT WITH ME
QUITTING THIS CHARITY THING?

17:03.667 --> 17:06.967
- HEY, CHARITY BEGINS
AT HOME.

17:09.067 --> 17:11.300
- YEAH, BUT I WAS
HELPING PEOPLE, YOU KNOW?

17:11.300 --> 17:14.000
I SHOULDN'T LET ROBERT
SPOIL THAT FOR EVERYBODY.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.567
WHAT I WAS DOING
IN THE HOSPITAL,

17:15.567 --> 17:17.600
IT'S IMPORTANT,
AND I WAS GOOD AT IT.

17:17.600 --> 17:20.533
- YEAH. BUT YOU'RE
QUITTING, RIGHT?

17:20.533 --> 17:22.067
- WHEN I GO IN THERE
TO VOLUNTEER,

17:22.067 --> 17:24.000
YOU SHOULD SEE HOW HAPPY
EVERYBODY IS TO SEE ME--

17:24.000 --> 17:26.467
EVERYBODY:
THE NURSES, THE PATIENTS.

17:26.467 --> 17:28.400
YOU KNOW
THEY ALL GIVE ME STUFF?

17:28.400 --> 17:29.633
EVEN THE SICK PEOPLE,

17:29.633 --> 17:31.200
WHEN THEY GET
THEIR GIFT BASKETS

17:31.200 --> 17:33.033
FROM PEOPLE WHO
DON'T WANT TO VISIT THEM,

17:33.033 --> 17:35.333
THERE'S ALWAYS A COOKIE
OR A BROWNIE

17:35.333 --> 17:37.167
OR A NICE PIECE
OF FRUIT FOR ME.

17:37.167 --> 17:39.633
YOU KNOW,
THE CAFETERIA STAFF,

17:39.633 --> 17:41.233
THEY'RE ALWAYS
BRINGING ME JELL-O.

17:41.233 --> 17:42.667
AND YOU KNOW THAT PIMPLE
ON THE BACK OF MY NECK

17:42.667 --> 17:44.700
THAT WON'T GO AWAY?

17:44.700 --> 17:48.033
DOCTOR'S GONNA GIVE ME
A CREAM FOR THAT FOR FREE!

17:48.033 --> 17:49.667
- OH, MY GOD!

17:49.667 --> 17:51.067
- I KNOW!
IT'S AMAZING, RIGHT?

17:51.067 --> 17:53.733
- NO!

17:53.733 --> 17:55.233
YOU'RE NOT THERE FOR THEM.

17:55.233 --> 17:56.700
YOU'RE THERE FOR YOU!

17:56.700 --> 18:00.167
YOU'RE DOING THIS
FOR ALL THE WRONG REASONS.

18:00.167 --> 18:01.433
- I'M DOING IT
FOR YOUR REASONS.

18:01.433 --> 18:02.767
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO SIGNED ME UP.

18:02.767 --> 18:04.567
- I SIGNED YOU UP
TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE,

18:04.567 --> 18:08.200
NOT TO HELP YOURSELF
TO FREE FRUIT AND PIMPLE CREAM.

18:11.400 --> 18:12.633
- HEY, GUYS.
- OH, LOOK WHO IT IS.

18:12.633 --> 18:15.200
WHERE'S
YOUR LITTLE BOYFRIEND?

18:22.767 --> 18:24.233
- RAYMOND, LOOK,
I'M SORRY

18:24.233 --> 18:26.000
WHAT HAPPENED TONIGHT
AT THE HOSPITAL.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.467
IT'S JUST THAT
TIMMY GETS ON A ROLL,

18:28.467 --> 18:30.333
AND IT'S KIND OF HARD
TO STOP HIM.

18:31.600 --> 18:32.733
LOOK. HERE.

18:32.733 --> 18:34.300
I BROUGHT YOU A PINEAPPLE.

18:34.300 --> 18:37.300
MRS. DEETS CAN'T TAKE
ALL THE ACIDITY.

18:37.300 --> 18:39.733
- I DON'T WANT
YOUR PINEAPPLE.

18:39.733 --> 18:42.300
I WAS FEELING PRETTY GOOD
ABOUT MYSELF

18:42.300 --> 18:45.067
UNTIL YOU SHOWED UP
WITH YOUR LITTLE EVIL PLAN

18:45.067 --> 18:48.200
TO TAKE AWAY
MY GIFT OF GIVING.

18:48.200 --> 18:50.400
- EVIL PLAN?
- THAT'S RIGHT!

18:50.400 --> 18:51.433
- THERE WAS NO PLAN.

18:51.433 --> 18:52.700
DEBRA JUST SUGGESTED

18:52.700 --> 18:54.133
I GO OVER THERE
WITH TRAFFIC COP TIMMY

18:54.133 --> 18:55.533
AND SPREAD A LITTLE CHEER.

18:57.533 --> 18:59.633
- ROBERT, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
JUST LEAVE RAY ALONE.

18:59.633 --> 19:01.300
- WAIT A MINUTE.

19:03.367 --> 19:06.400
WAIT A MINUTE.
"DEBRA SUGGESTED"?

19:06.400 --> 19:09.667
YOU SENT HIM IN THERE?

19:09.667 --> 19:12.167
- RAY...

19:12.167 --> 19:13.233
I JUST...

19:13.233 --> 19:16.433
COME ON!

19:16.433 --> 19:21.333
- OH, OH, OHH!

19:21.333 --> 19:26.633
DIRTY LAUNDRY
IS COMING HOME TO ROOST!

19:26.633 --> 19:28.167
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

19:28.167 --> 19:29.667
- YOU WANTED HIM
TO TAKE MY PLACE, RIGHT,

19:29.667 --> 19:31.133
SO I COULD STAY HOME

19:31.133 --> 19:33.067
AND YOU COULD
PRETTY YOURSELF UP

19:33.067 --> 19:34.567
AND GO OUT ON THE TOWN

19:34.567 --> 19:36.400
WITH YOUR FACE PAINTED
AND YOUR GEWGAWS!

19:36.400 --> 19:38.133
YEAH.

19:38.133 --> 19:39.767
YOU DON'T CARE
ABOUT THE OLD OR THE SICK.

19:39.767 --> 19:42.000
YOU DON'T CARE
THAT THEIR ENTERTAINMENT NOW

19:42.000 --> 19:43.600
IS A LARGE MAN
WITH HIS HAND

19:43.600 --> 19:47.300
UP THE BEHIND
OF A SMALL PLASTIC MAN!

19:54.033 --> 19:55.733
- RAY, YOU WERE SPENDING
ALL YOUR TIME THERE.

19:55.733 --> 19:56.767
YOU WERE NEVER HERE.

19:56.767 --> 19:58.433
- I WAS DOING CHARITY,

19:58.433 --> 20:00.033
AND BECAUSE
IT WASN'T CONVENIENT FOR YOU,

20:00.033 --> 20:01.433
YOU WANTED ME TO STOP.

20:01.433 --> 20:04.733
- RAY, ALL I DID--
- BHUP BHUP BHUP BHUP!

20:04.733 --> 20:08.067
I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD BE TALKING TO ME.

20:08.067 --> 20:11.433
I THINK YOU SHOULD BE
TALKING TO...

20:18.400 --> 20:19.633
- BUT I--
- BHUP!

20:36.400 --> 20:39.067
- ROBERT, WHY DID YOU
HAVE TO SAY THAT?

20:39.067 --> 20:40.333
- IS THAT WHY
YOU REALLY WANTED ME

20:40.333 --> 20:42.133
TO ENTERTAIN
AT THE HOSPITAL?

20:42.133 --> 20:44.633
YOU SAID I SHOULD GO THERE
BECAUSE I WAS A...

20:44.633 --> 20:47.000
GREAT VENTRILOQUIST.

20:48.400 --> 20:53.000
- YOU ARE, ROBERT.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.400
- [gasps]

20:54.400 --> 20:56.700
DEBRA!

20:58.133 --> 20:59.733
- OH, ROBERT,
LOOK, I'M SORRY.

20:59.733 --> 21:02.100
- NO, NO. IT'S OKAY.

21:02.100 --> 21:05.133
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
APOLOGIZE TO ME.

21:05.133 --> 21:06.200
- BUT, ROBERT, I--

21:16.467 --> 21:18.200
- AND FOR YOUR INFORMATION,

21:18.200 --> 21:19.400
I GOT LAUGHS.

21:19.400 --> 21:21.233
I GOT REAL LAUGHS.

21:21.233 --> 21:24.167
I TORE THE ROOF
OFF THE SUCKER.

21:32.167 --> 21:34.133
- [singing]
WHEN YOU'RE SMILING

21:34.133 --> 21:36.100
WHEN YOU'RE SMILING

21:36.100 --> 21:39.133
THE WHOLE WORLD
SMILES WITH YOU
