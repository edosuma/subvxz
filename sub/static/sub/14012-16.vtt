00:00.668 --> 00:03.202
<i>In the criminal justice system,</i>

00:03.204 --> 00:04.887
<i> the people are represented</i>

00:04.888 --> 00:06.571
<i> by two separate</i>
<i> yet equally important groups:</i>

00:06.574 --> 00:08.474
<i> the police,</i>
<i> who investigate crime</i>

00:08.476 --> 00:11.377
<i> and the district attorneys,</i>
<i> who prosecute the offenders.</i>

00:11.379 --> 00:15.314
<i> These are their stories.</i>

00:15.316 --> 00:18.083
Mrs. Schwinger
on the fourth floor's

00:18.085 --> 00:20.219
been complaining
three times a day.

00:20.221 --> 00:21.387
So it's slow.

00:21.389 --> 00:23.055
What's her rush,
anyway?

00:23.057 --> 00:25.024
It's not the controls.

00:25.026 --> 00:26.025
Gears?

00:26.027 --> 00:27.259
Or the brakes
jamming.

00:27.261 --> 00:28.794
It's probably kids.

00:28.796 --> 00:31.163
Bozos call it
elevator surfing.

00:31.165 --> 00:34.166
Ride the tops,
jump from one to the other.

00:34.168 --> 00:36.168
Give me a flashlight,
will you?

00:36.170 --> 00:38.170
I just don't want
any lawsuits.

00:38.172 --> 00:40.105
I been here 12 years.

00:40.107 --> 00:41.340
Never opened.

00:41.342 --> 00:45.210
Going to have to take it
down to the basement.

00:45.212 --> 00:47.046
Lower it slow.

00:49.216 --> 00:50.516
You Local 196?

00:50.518 --> 00:52.351
Wouldn't work if I wasn't.

00:52.353 --> 00:54.620
My brother-in-law,
20 years of dues.

00:54.622 --> 00:56.822
Now he's
in St. Thomas...

00:56.824 --> 00:59.058
Oh, my God.

00:59.060 --> 01:01.093
Stop the damn thing.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.134
This is preliminary.

01:09.136 --> 01:10.469
CERRETA:
We're listening.

01:10.471 --> 01:12.071
Death by strangulation.

01:12.073 --> 01:13.338
Looks like a wire.

01:13.340 --> 01:16.341
Premortem cuts and abrasions
on the face.

01:16.343 --> 01:17.476
She fought back.

01:17.478 --> 01:18.844
I bagged her hands

01:18.846 --> 01:21.246
in case there's anything
under her nails.

01:21.248 --> 01:23.182
She's partially
out of rigor.

01:23.184 --> 01:25.284
She's been dead
24 to 36 hours.

01:25.286 --> 01:26.485
Monday night.

01:26.487 --> 01:28.854
Mr. Hellman,

01:28.856 --> 01:31.156
have you ever
seen her before?

01:31.158 --> 01:33.358
Yeah. Judy Bream, 3B.

01:33.360 --> 01:35.160
She live alone?

01:35.162 --> 01:36.161
Yeah. Alone.

01:36.163 --> 01:37.563
you do--
Here's what

01:37.565 --> 01:40.499
first, let those men
into Judy's apartment

01:40.501 --> 01:43.502
then later I'll have
some questions for you.

01:43.504 --> 01:45.537
Does this sound familiar?

01:45.539 --> 01:48.173
Young woman, nude,
strangled with wire

01:48.175 --> 01:51.643
duct tape on her face,
body tossed like garbage.

01:51.645 --> 01:54.246
East River Park,
six months ago.

01:54.248 --> 01:55.581
Same guy?

01:55.583 --> 01:57.116
Could be.

01:57.118 --> 02:00.152
That would be number two
in a series of...

02:00.154 --> 02:04.156
Well, it depends on how late
in his game we're coming in.

02:33.621 --> 02:37.556
   Captioning sponsored by
   NBC/UNIVERSAL

03:37.985 --> 03:40.586
She was a grad student
at Columbia.

03:40.588 --> 03:42.988
Some kind of ancient
history, I think.

03:42.990 --> 03:45.958
Moved in about
a year and a half ago.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.693
Family lives
in Hartford.

03:47.695 --> 03:49.561
Old man cosigned
the lease.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.496
What kind of tenant
was she?

03:51.498 --> 03:52.497
A doll.

03:52.499 --> 03:54.633
If they were
all like her...

03:54.635 --> 03:56.235
What about boyfriends?

03:56.237 --> 03:57.636
I don't keep track.

03:57.638 --> 03:59.705
Anyway, when you're
young and beautiful,

03:59.707 --> 04:01.640
who wants to be alone?

04:01.642 --> 04:03.008
Tell me about
this building, okay?

04:03.010 --> 04:05.744
Anybody hanging around
who didn't belong?

04:05.746 --> 04:07.479
On the Upper West Side?

04:07.481 --> 04:08.747
You want them all

04:08.749 --> 04:12.584
or just the ones
that talk to themselves?

04:12.586 --> 04:14.519
No sign of forcible entry.

04:14.521 --> 04:17.522
Must have been somebody
she knew or expected.

04:17.524 --> 04:19.591
There's nothing
about it in here.

04:19.593 --> 04:23.528
This whole week's marked off
as being in Connecticut.

04:23.530 --> 04:25.597
Her folks live in Hartford.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.399
Last couple
of months

04:27.401 --> 04:31.003
two doctor's visits,
a paper, three exams

04:31.005 --> 04:33.672
one potluck dinner.

04:33.674 --> 04:36.675
Found it on the floor
near the bed.

04:36.677 --> 04:39.044
Wrapper for
a Polaroid cartridge.

04:39.046 --> 04:40.479
She have a camera?

04:40.481 --> 04:41.947
Didn't find one.

04:41.948 --> 04:43.414
Think our boy's
a shutterbug?

04:43.417 --> 04:44.549
Some are.

04:44.551 --> 04:47.286
Helps them to remember
the good times.

04:50.691 --> 04:52.991
Let's hope
this is a coincidence.

04:52.993 --> 04:54.559
I don't think so.

04:54.561 --> 04:57.696
We turned up a third vic
three months ago in Queens.

04:57.698 --> 05:02.301
All three
taped, strangled, tossed.

05:02.303 --> 05:03.302
Rape?

05:03.304 --> 05:04.803
No evidence of penetration.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.571
Three kills
in six months.

05:06.573 --> 05:08.740
Slow but consistent.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.042
Oh, man.

05:11.445 --> 05:13.929
All right.

05:13.930 --> 05:16.414
Nothing to encourage this guy
to pick up the pace.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.582
No press.

05:17.584 --> 05:19.084
I want to keep this
off the books.

05:19.085 --> 05:20.585
Anything you need,
you come directly to me.

05:20.587 --> 05:23.588
Did he leave us
anything at all to go on?

05:23.590 --> 05:25.590
Autopsy report...

05:25.592 --> 05:28.093
says digestion
on her stomach contents

05:28.095 --> 05:29.661
puts the time of death

05:29.663 --> 05:32.664
between 7:00 and 8:00
Monday night.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.833
Other than that,
we got<i> nada.</i>

05:34.835 --> 05:37.102
No prints,
no fluids, no hairs.

05:37.104 --> 05:39.104
Regular angel of death.

05:39.106 --> 05:40.672
The last one--
Judy Bream--

05:40.674 --> 05:42.607
he tossed down
the elevator shaft.

05:42.609 --> 05:44.042
And?

05:44.044 --> 05:45.610
You need a special key.

05:45.612 --> 05:48.580
Elevator repairmen,
firemen, electricians.

05:48.582 --> 05:50.482
Great. So, that narrows it
down to, what?

05:50.484 --> 05:52.034
About 100,000 suspects?

05:52.035 --> 05:53.585
Hey, the guys in Brooklyn
were lucky, huh?

05:53.587 --> 05:55.721
They got the Son of Sam
on parking tickets.

05:55.723 --> 05:58.623
Yeah. Six months
and six bodies later.

05:58.625 --> 06:00.092
(<i> phone buzzes</i> )

06:00.094 --> 06:01.560
What?

06:02.696 --> 06:03.695
Yeah.

06:03.697 --> 06:04.763
Thanks.

06:06.667 --> 06:09.101
The Breams are outside.

06:09.103 --> 06:11.570
You want to do it
in here?

06:11.572 --> 06:12.637
No.

06:12.639 --> 06:14.706
Let's take
an interrogation room.

06:23.450 --> 06:25.517
I told her
she'd be safer

06:25.519 --> 06:28.553
in one of the university
residences,

06:28.555 --> 06:29.788
but, uh...

06:29.790 --> 06:31.556
she knew better.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.825
Had to have
her own place.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.660
(<i> sighs</i> )

06:35.662 --> 06:38.530
Judy was never afraid
of anything

06:38.532 --> 06:40.866
not even as a child.

06:42.669 --> 06:47.672
We know that Judy was supposed
to spend the week with you.

06:47.674 --> 06:50.809
Was there any reason
that those plans were changed?

06:50.811 --> 06:54.880
She got a call Sunday afternoon
up at our house--

06:54.882 --> 06:59.918
someone connected
with the building.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.554
MRS. BREAM:
I heard...

07:02.556 --> 07:05.557
I heard her call him Mr. Cook.

07:05.559 --> 07:08.593
Um... some work had to be done.

07:08.595 --> 07:11.496
Do you know what kind of work?

07:12.566 --> 07:13.932
No.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.567
Something electrical.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.804
With the wiring.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.605
They...

07:20.607 --> 07:22.507
(<i> sobbing</i> )

07:27.181 --> 07:30.615
They had to move
the furniture.

07:30.617 --> 07:33.718
At least
that's what Judy said.

07:36.523 --> 07:38.590
Would Judy have told
the building manager

07:38.592 --> 07:39.891
how to reach her
up in Connecticut?

07:39.893 --> 07:41.660
MR. BREAM:
No. She didn't
have to.

07:41.662 --> 07:43.895
Her calls were forwarded.

07:43.897 --> 07:46.731
Her phone, was it...?

07:46.733 --> 07:48.600
Was it listed?

07:49.937 --> 07:51.203
No.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.873
I thought it would be safer.

07:54.875 --> 07:56.875
(<i> Mrs. Bream sobbing softly</i> )

07:56.877 --> 07:59.010
All three were killed
in their apartments.

07:59.012 --> 08:01.913
But the first two were dumped
at least half mile away,

08:01.915 --> 08:04.182
while Judy Bream was
left in her building.

08:04.184 --> 08:05.183
Why?

08:05.185 --> 08:06.418
He's in a rush.

08:06.419 --> 08:07.652
Couldn't get her
out of the building.

08:07.654 --> 08:09.121
It doesn't make sense.

08:09.122 --> 08:10.589
It would be easier to leave
them in their apartments.

08:10.591 --> 08:11.590
He does it, Phil.

08:11.592 --> 08:12.757
It's got to mean
something, Phil.

08:12.759 --> 08:15.694
What?
Power? Degradation?

08:15.696 --> 08:16.695
A sense of finality?

08:16.697 --> 08:17.696
Okay,
thanks.

08:17.698 --> 08:18.964
If this guy knew these girls,

08:18.966 --> 08:21.633
it wasn't because
he changed their fuses.

08:21.635 --> 08:23.535
Their buildings were serviced

08:23.537 --> 08:25.770
by three different
electrical contractors.

08:25.772 --> 08:27.772
There's got to be a connection.

08:27.774 --> 08:29.641
He picks
these girls.

08:29.643 --> 08:30.775
Volunteer work--

08:30.777 --> 08:32.911
Judy Bream
did three hours a week

08:32.913 --> 08:35.247
at the Stuart Counseling Center
in the Bronx.

08:35.249 --> 08:38.216
Debra Beckett did United Way
every Christmas.

08:38.218 --> 08:41.052
A couple of times a year
at a soup kitchen.

08:41.054 --> 08:43.522
Sandy Markham,
no charity work.

08:43.524 --> 08:44.623
Lots of political.

08:44.625 --> 08:47.659
Canvassed for
Senator Peppino in '90.

08:47.661 --> 08:50.762
Registered "not interested."

08:50.764 --> 08:52.864
State politics
in Connecticut.

08:52.866 --> 08:55.534
Sport club membership,
Columbia athletic.

08:55.536 --> 08:56.668
Racquetball every day.

08:56.670 --> 08:59.738
Mine goes to the Downtown Y.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.306
Not a jock.

09:01.308 --> 09:02.941
Repeated visits

09:02.943 --> 09:05.744
to Dr. Phillip Banks,
OB-GYN.

09:05.746 --> 09:06.811
Who?

09:06.813 --> 09:08.680
Phillip Banks.

09:08.682 --> 09:11.016
You got, uh...

09:11.018 --> 09:13.051
you got Bream's

09:13.053 --> 09:14.819
appointment book?

09:19.560 --> 09:21.626
She was seeing a doctor.

09:23.931 --> 09:25.664
In November.

09:26.833 --> 09:30.936
November 24,
Dr. P. Banks, 9:00 A.M.

09:30.938 --> 09:32.604
What about your Queens lady?

09:37.711 --> 09:39.311
He... Crap.

09:39.313 --> 09:41.046
It's not a match.

09:41.048 --> 09:44.349
Dr. Charles Cohen,
Forest Hills.

09:44.351 --> 09:46.985
Still, we got two out of three.

09:48.589 --> 09:50.589
It's worth a look.

09:52.726 --> 09:54.793
Well, Marcus Welby he's not.

09:54.795 --> 09:57.596
One assault charge
three years ago.

09:57.598 --> 09:59.731
He pleaded down
to a misdemeanor.

09:59.733 --> 10:01.833
Complainant was his ex-wife.
Dig this.

10:01.835 --> 10:05.704
Broke her jaw during
a marriage counseling session.

10:05.706 --> 10:08.673
This man is a lover
<i> and</i> a fighter.

10:08.675 --> 10:10.075
The AMA has received

10:10.077 --> 10:12.377
over a dozen complaints
against Banks.

10:12.379 --> 10:15.013
Former patients,
their husbands--

10:15.015 --> 10:16.381
the doc likes to play around

10:16.382 --> 10:17.748
while his patients
are in the stirrups.

10:17.751 --> 10:19.017
He still has a license?

10:19.019 --> 10:20.085
Protect thine own.

10:20.087 --> 10:23.154
The AMA refused to pursue.

10:27.861 --> 10:30.862
I just know what I read
in the papers.

10:30.864 --> 10:32.998
The city's going
straight to hell.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.367
She'd been your
patient for long?

10:35.369 --> 10:37.335
First appointment
was, uh, February.

10:37.337 --> 10:38.637
Routine pelvic.

10:38.639 --> 10:40.338
You ever ask her out?

10:40.340 --> 10:42.774
CERRETA:
Debra Beckett--

10:42.776 --> 10:44.643
she was your patient, too,
right?

10:44.645 --> 10:46.678
What the hell
are you getting at?

10:46.680 --> 10:48.547
Two of your
patients

10:48.548 --> 10:50.415
have been murdered
in the last three months.

10:51.852 --> 10:54.919
CERRETA:
Did you ever examine
Sandy Markham?

10:54.921 --> 10:56.121
No.

10:56.123 --> 10:57.789
Do you mind
if we check your records?

10:57.791 --> 10:59.924
Sure, be my guest.
My nurse will help you.

10:59.926 --> 11:01.843
Thanks. By the way,

11:01.844 --> 11:03.761
did you happen to have a date
last Monday night?

11:03.764 --> 11:04.863
Yes.

11:04.865 --> 11:07.866
Emily Feist,
nine pounds, three ounces.

11:07.868 --> 11:12.737
Born Monday, 7:16 P.M.,
after three hours of labor.

11:12.739 --> 11:14.072
Yeah.

11:14.074 --> 11:16.941
What do you got?

11:16.943 --> 11:19.044
Okay. Thanks a lot.

11:19.046 --> 11:22.147
Hospital has him
signing in at 4:16,

11:22.149 --> 11:24.149
signing out
at ten to 8:00.

11:24.151 --> 11:26.918
It would take him
at least 20 minutes

11:26.920 --> 11:28.920
to get to Judy Bream's place.

11:28.922 --> 11:32.090
The M.E. puts the time
of death between 7:00 and 8:00.

11:32.092 --> 11:34.959
But M.E.'s have been known
to be off by an hour or so.

11:34.961 --> 11:36.928
We still have to connect
Sandy Markham.

11:36.930 --> 11:38.096
She never saw Dr. Banks.

11:38.098 --> 11:40.132
Maybe he's lying.

11:40.133 --> 11:42.167
Maybe she did see him
under a different name.

11:42.169 --> 11:45.203
Let's go talk
to Dr. Cohen.

11:46.773 --> 11:49.241
No.

11:49.242 --> 11:51.710
Sandy Markham was referred
by Dr. Rosen on Park Avenue.

11:51.712 --> 11:54.079
Had she ever been treated
by Dr. Banks?

11:55.182 --> 11:57.082
We can get a subpoena.

11:57.084 --> 11:58.183
If she had been,

11:58.185 --> 12:00.919
I think she would
have told me.

12:00.921 --> 12:02.487
Why?

12:04.725 --> 12:06.091
He's a disgrace.

12:06.093 --> 12:09.194
I wouldn't send my schnauzer
to see Phillip Banks.

12:09.196 --> 12:11.463
You don't like
his bedside manner?

12:11.465 --> 12:13.131
The guy's a walking lawsuit.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.132
Malpractice?

12:14.134 --> 12:15.934
Now he's
branching out.

12:15.936 --> 12:18.837
My bookkeeper tells they're
after him for insurance fraud.

12:18.839 --> 12:21.139
You and Banks have
the same bookkeeper?

12:21.141 --> 12:24.476
Yes.

12:25.746 --> 12:28.279
You mind giving us his name?

12:28.281 --> 12:30.749
Albert Lawrence Cheney.

12:30.751 --> 12:32.751
Spent five years
in Attica.

12:32.753 --> 12:34.152
Cheating on his taxes?

12:34.154 --> 12:37.889
He got Man Two,
paroled in '89...

12:37.891 --> 12:40.959
He killed a girl
in Queens.

12:40.961 --> 12:42.794
Strangulation? Tape?

12:44.030 --> 12:46.264
Rest of the file
will be in tomorrow.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.183
You want to wait?

12:48.184 --> 12:50.101
Not on your life.
Risk losing another one? No.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.272
Hello?

12:54.274 --> 12:55.273
Hello.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.275
Does Albert Cheney
live here?

12:57.277 --> 12:58.309
Yes.

12:58.311 --> 13:00.145
Is he here

13:00.147 --> 13:02.514
because we'd like
to talk to him.

13:02.516 --> 13:03.515
I'm Mrs. Cheney.

13:03.517 --> 13:05.116
Is there a problem?

13:05.118 --> 13:06.885
No, it's not a problem.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.553
Just want to talk to him.

13:08.555 --> 13:10.121
He's in
the other room.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.089
He's busy working.

13:11.091 --> 13:12.257
Excuse me.

13:12.259 --> 13:15.293
Are you Albert
Lawrence Cheney?

13:17.030 --> 13:19.030
Yes.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.899
Do you mind if we talk?

13:20.901 --> 13:22.167
I'm in the middle...

13:22.169 --> 13:24.269
LOGAN:
I think it will keep.

13:27.040 --> 13:31.009
Don't you think we'd be
more comfortable at the station?

13:38.985 --> 13:41.019
Look, I'm not trying
to outrun my past.

13:41.021 --> 13:42.453
I did the time.

13:42.455 --> 13:44.055
LOGAN:
So you're
rehabilitated.

13:44.057 --> 13:45.456
I didn't<i> do</i> the crime.

13:45.458 --> 13:46.991
CERRETA:
Aren't you bitter

13:46.993 --> 13:50.094
having spent five years
in Attica for something

13:50.096 --> 13:51.830
you didn't do?

13:51.832 --> 13:53.832
I'm at peace with it now.

13:53.834 --> 13:56.968
I was unlucky enough
to be at the wrong place

13:56.970 --> 13:58.603
at the wrong time.

13:58.605 --> 13:59.971
My lawyer said

13:59.973 --> 14:02.006
the best thing was to deal.

14:02.008 --> 14:04.976
"Five was better than 15,"
he said.

14:04.978 --> 14:06.778
You work

14:06.779 --> 14:08.579
with Dr. Banks<i> and</i> Dr. Cohen.

14:08.582 --> 14:12.450
And Burton and Scarlon
and Schuman.

14:12.452 --> 14:13.985
How long you been
keeping books?

14:13.987 --> 14:15.453
Two years, since I got out.

14:15.455 --> 14:16.487
And before that?

14:16.489 --> 14:18.857
Master electrician.

14:18.859 --> 14:21.993
Manhattan Power
doesn't like ex-cons.

14:21.995 --> 14:24.429
Last Monday night,
you remember what you did?

14:24.431 --> 14:29.067
My wife and I went
to dinner and a movie.

14:29.069 --> 14:32.537
It was an early show, 5:00.

14:35.008 --> 14:38.109
You know a woman
named Judy Bream?

14:45.185 --> 14:48.052
Why? What happened to her?

14:48.054 --> 14:49.554
She was murdered.

14:52.158 --> 14:55.627
We had pizza
at Julio's in Astoria.

14:55.629 --> 14:58.196
What time did you
leave the restaurant?

14:58.198 --> 15:02.567
Around 8:00, although
I'm not exactly certain.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.002
Where did you go?

15:04.004 --> 15:05.536
I drove Albert home.

15:05.538 --> 15:08.539
I went to work,
the Post Office. night shift.

15:08.541 --> 15:10.541
I punched in at 9:00.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.543
Have you been married
a long time?

15:12.545 --> 15:14.245
A year.

15:18.218 --> 15:22.987
Seven years ago,
I saw his picture in the paper.

15:22.989 --> 15:25.924
He had such gentle eyes.

15:25.926 --> 15:28.927
I wrote him
and he wrote me back.

15:28.929 --> 15:30.662
And when he was released?

15:30.664 --> 15:34.132
He joined our church group,
St. Eligius Baptist.

15:34.134 --> 15:37.702
He's a good man, Detective.

15:37.704 --> 15:39.070
Phil.

15:44.077 --> 15:46.611
It was in the bottom drawer.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.079
There's no film,

15:48.081 --> 15:51.115
but it's the same type
to fit the wrapper we found.

15:51.117 --> 15:53.184
My son has the same one.

15:53.186 --> 15:55.019
Look at this.

15:58.224 --> 15:59.657
Duct tape.

16:01.661 --> 16:04.095
Your son got one of these--

16:04.097 --> 16:07.732
a Manhattan Power Company
employee I.D.?

16:07.734 --> 16:10.969
Expires June, 1985.

16:10.971 --> 16:14.072
Think Albert kept it
as a souvenir?

16:21.214 --> 16:22.680
The fibers
from his washer-dryer--

16:22.682 --> 16:24.349
beige with a wool/acrylic
weave--

16:24.350 --> 16:26.017
matched the carpeting
in Judy Bream's apartment.

16:26.019 --> 16:29.020
Must have been
on Cheney's clothes

16:29.022 --> 16:30.288
when he washed them.

16:30.290 --> 16:31.689
Puts him at the scene.

16:31.691 --> 16:34.258
Or in my apartment
or 10,000 others.

16:34.260 --> 16:35.693
It's not what you'd
call unique.

16:35.695 --> 16:38.262
Had better luck
with the duct tape.

16:38.264 --> 16:40.164
The roll
from Cheney's apartment,

16:40.166 --> 16:42.233
same as the tape
recovered from the body.

16:42.235 --> 16:44.235
We pieced together
the tape on the roll

16:44.237 --> 16:46.404
with the tape on the girl.

16:46.405 --> 16:48.572
The tears at the end were ragged
enough to make a match.

16:48.575 --> 16:52.276
So, please tell me
this is conclusive.

16:52.278 --> 16:53.277
Probable.

16:53.279 --> 16:54.312
Sorry.

16:54.314 --> 16:56.214
CRAGEN:
<i> Duct tape</i>

16:56.216 --> 17:00.018
carpet fibers, I.D. card,
prior conviction--

17:00.020 --> 17:01.619
it adds up, Paul.

17:01.621 --> 17:03.054
To a weak indictment.

17:03.056 --> 17:05.023
The prior bad act
is inadmissible,

17:05.025 --> 17:06.758
the rest,
circumstantial.

17:06.760 --> 17:07.759
What about Cheney's phone?

17:07.761 --> 17:09.293
Brick wall-- the LUD's show

17:09.295 --> 17:11.696
no telephone calls
to any of the victims.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.331
Alibi?

17:13.333 --> 17:15.733
His wife punched in
to work at 9:00.

17:15.735 --> 17:18.669
Before that, nobody remembers
him at the movies or restaurant.

17:18.671 --> 17:20.705
An alibi that
can't be verified.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.724
Or refuted.

17:22.725 --> 17:24.742
It's possible we're wrong
about Cheney.

17:24.744 --> 17:26.044
Guilty people call their
lawyers-- he hasn't.

17:26.046 --> 17:28.046
And innocent people
kick and scream.

17:28.048 --> 17:29.380
I haven't seen him do that
either.

17:29.382 --> 17:32.116
You guys want
to indict him

17:32.118 --> 17:34.052
then have it
just die?

17:34.054 --> 17:35.653
Fine.

17:38.725 --> 17:41.092
Get Cheney
into interrogation.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.466
Look at it, Albert.

17:48.468 --> 17:50.134
You're the only one.

17:50.136 --> 17:52.437
No one else appears here
three times.

17:52.439 --> 17:54.272
You want to explain that to me?

17:54.274 --> 17:55.273
It's a fluke.

17:55.275 --> 17:56.741
Fine.

17:56.743 --> 18:00.244
Maybe you can help me
because we're a little stumped.

18:00.246 --> 18:03.748
Who else has total access
to these women's lives?

18:03.750 --> 18:06.751
You look at their files
every day.

18:06.753 --> 18:09.787
You look at their charts,
their billing statements.

18:09.789 --> 18:11.789
Do the doctors you work for,

18:11.791 --> 18:13.658
do they know you snoop
through patients' files?

18:13.660 --> 18:15.226
I don't do that.

18:15.228 --> 18:17.128
I just do
the accounting.

18:17.130 --> 18:18.763
Maybe so, Albert,
maybe so,

18:18.765 --> 18:20.765
but we know
you did Judy Bream.

18:20.767 --> 18:21.766
We know that.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.768
I never met those girls.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.703
I told you.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.108
Okay...

18:30.110 --> 18:32.110
You recognize this?

18:32.112 --> 18:35.279
It's a picture
of your electrician's I.D.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.381
I worked there
for five years.

18:37.383 --> 18:38.716
That was eight years ago.

18:38.718 --> 18:41.052
How come you kept it so long?

18:41.053 --> 18:43.387
We know how you got
into those girls' apartments.

18:43.389 --> 18:45.790
We know all about
your electrician's routine.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.692
You're a pretty smart guy,
Albert--

18:47.694 --> 18:50.228
like the way
you opened those elevator doors

18:50.230 --> 18:52.263
to toss Judy Bream's body
down there.

18:52.265 --> 18:53.498
Boy, that had us going.

18:53.500 --> 18:54.732
Till we figured out
you were using

18:54.734 --> 18:56.100
one of those elevator
access keys.

18:56.101 --> 18:57.467
All you electricians
have those access
keys, don't you?

18:57.470 --> 18:58.536
I don't know about any key.

18:58.538 --> 19:00.171
Oh, sure you do.

19:00.172 --> 19:01.805
We checked with Manhattan Power.
They told us that you do.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.274
They told us
that after you were fired,

19:03.276 --> 19:04.275
you didn't turn in the key.

19:04.277 --> 19:05.143
That's not true.

19:05.145 --> 19:05.543
It's true.

19:05.545 --> 19:07.145
Albert.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.746
Albert, don't
fight us on this.

19:08.748 --> 19:10.815
We know that you
didn't turn it in.
They told us.

19:10.817 --> 19:13.284
He was fired
eight years ago.

19:13.286 --> 19:16.287
Manhattan Power keeps records
of their keys?

19:16.289 --> 19:19.290
They don't even know
if he really had one.

19:19.292 --> 19:22.493
Look, I just don't think
that's true.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.795
I can't remember having one.

19:24.797 --> 19:26.864
See you in a while, pal.

19:31.171 --> 19:34.572
This was next to Judy's bed
on the floor.

19:34.574 --> 19:38.509
It's the exact same kind
of film your camera uses.

19:38.511 --> 19:44.248
She doesn't even have
a camera like that.

19:44.250 --> 19:46.450
How did it get there?

19:46.452 --> 19:49.320
When did you take
the pictures, Albert?

19:49.322 --> 19:51.539
Before you killed her?

19:51.540 --> 19:53.757
Be much more gruesome
after, though, wouldn't it?

19:53.760 --> 19:55.326
It's your work.

19:55.328 --> 19:57.328
You could see what you've done.

19:57.330 --> 19:59.597
I've never even been
in her place.

19:59.599 --> 20:01.332
And yet, your duct tape
was there,

20:01.334 --> 20:03.568
there were carpet fibers
on your clothes,

20:03.570 --> 20:06.337
you got her address
from Dr. Banks's files

20:06.339 --> 20:08.940
and you have
an electrician's badge!

20:08.942 --> 20:11.409
You like looking
at those pictures,

20:11.411 --> 20:12.510
don't you, Albert?

20:12.512 --> 20:14.478
Takes you back.

20:14.480 --> 20:18.416
You got a special
place for them?

20:21.554 --> 20:24.555
I don't have any pictures.

20:31.564 --> 20:34.599
CRAGEN:
These are ligature marks,
Albert.

20:34.601 --> 20:37.802
You see,
when you strangle someone,

20:37.804 --> 20:39.437
you leave marks

20:39.439 --> 20:40.571
like fingerprints.

20:40.573 --> 20:43.057
This is...

20:43.058 --> 20:45.542
Sally Kessler, the girl
you killed eight years ago.

20:45.545 --> 20:48.813
See those ligature marks
way up high?

20:48.815 --> 20:50.581
Just like the ones
on Judy's neck.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.917
You like to get them
up high, don't you?

20:52.919 --> 20:55.553
They take longer to suffocate
that way, right?

20:55.555 --> 20:59.023
CRAGEN:
Is that when you get
your knee in their back

20:59.025 --> 21:00.491
and give it a yank?

21:00.493 --> 21:02.927
You know what I want to know?

21:02.929 --> 21:06.564
Why did you switch from ties
to electrical cord?

21:06.566 --> 21:07.898
Is that better?

21:07.900 --> 21:09.634
You get more control that way?

21:09.636 --> 21:12.536
Maybe the ties
were a little too risky, huh?

21:12.538 --> 21:15.373
A couple wind up
damaged or missing.

21:15.375 --> 21:17.608
The wife starts wondering,
thinking, asking questions.

21:17.610 --> 21:21.579
"Is the man I sit next to
in church every Sunday

21:21.581 --> 21:23.848
really what he
says he is?"

21:23.850 --> 21:26.384
I...

21:26.386 --> 21:28.586
I'm tired.

21:28.588 --> 21:30.955
You want to talk
to a lawyer?

21:30.957 --> 21:32.990
Get it off your chest.

21:32.992 --> 21:34.525
It will be privileged.

21:34.527 --> 21:37.078
No.

21:37.079 --> 21:39.630
It's just that I'm tired,
that's all.

21:41.301 --> 21:43.534
I want to go lie down.

21:43.536 --> 21:45.703
Yeah, okay, soon,
very soon.

21:45.705 --> 21:48.439
I just want to go over

21:48.441 --> 21:51.309
a couple more things
here, all right?

22:02.555 --> 22:06.724
CERRETA:
These are the keys
we found in your apartment.

22:06.726 --> 22:08.993
Which one
is the elevator key?

22:08.995 --> 22:11.996
I don't know
if I have one.

22:11.998 --> 22:13.397
They say you did.

22:13.399 --> 22:15.700
You kept it
like you kept your I.D.

22:15.702 --> 22:17.635
Is it this one here, huh?

22:17.637 --> 22:19.337
No, that's uh, uh...

22:19.339 --> 22:22.073
Sara's old place
in the Bronx.

22:22.075 --> 22:24.108
How about this one?

22:24.110 --> 22:26.610
That's for the garage.

22:26.612 --> 22:28.412
What about this?

22:28.414 --> 22:30.414
Sara's bicycle.

22:30.416 --> 22:32.383
The lock.

22:32.385 --> 22:34.552
This one?

22:36.456 --> 22:38.589
Is that an elevator access key?

22:38.591 --> 22:40.725
No. It's for the storage.

22:40.727 --> 22:42.526
You're lying, Albert.

22:42.528 --> 22:44.628
Your building has no storage.

22:44.630 --> 22:46.030
Not there.

22:46.032 --> 22:47.531
I mean on Sutphin.

22:47.533 --> 22:50.501
One of those rental places?

22:56.376 --> 22:58.776
What do you keep there, Albert?

22:58.778 --> 23:01.645
Just, uh...

23:04.450 --> 23:05.583
junk.

23:09.455 --> 23:12.390
The pictures.

23:12.392 --> 23:16.127
I'll get working
on a search warrant.

23:24.704 --> 23:26.437
According to this,

23:26.439 --> 23:28.672
the guy came in
about once a week

23:28.674 --> 23:30.441
usually in the evenings.

23:30.443 --> 23:31.509
LOGAN:
Phil!

23:35.415 --> 23:37.081
Some people collect

23:37.083 --> 23:38.783
baseball cards.

23:45.591 --> 23:47.425
BAILIFF:
Case number 750127,

23:47.427 --> 23:49.627
<i> People v.</i>
<i> Albert Lawrence Cheney.</i>

23:49.629 --> 23:53.431
Three counts of murder
in the second degree.

23:53.433 --> 23:56.567
Talk to me.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.670
Counselor?

23:59.672 --> 24:01.172
Not guilty, Your Honor.

24:01.174 --> 24:02.640
Mr. Robinette?

24:02.642 --> 24:05.142
Your Honor, as far
as the State is concerned,

24:05.144 --> 24:07.978
the heinous nature
of the crimes charged

24:07.980 --> 24:10.981
mandates that the defendant
be held without bail.

24:10.983 --> 24:13.217
My client has rights.

24:13.219 --> 24:14.919
And so do the rest of women
in this city.

24:14.921 --> 24:15.920
I think that's...

24:15.922 --> 24:17.087
Save it, Carl.

24:17.089 --> 24:19.690
Court orders
defendant held without bail.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.994
All right,
you behave yourself.

24:32.205 --> 24:34.171
The police repeatedly told
Albert Cheney

24:34.173 --> 24:37.174
he had a right
to an attorney.

24:37.176 --> 24:38.943
He waived that right?

24:38.945 --> 24:40.144
Several times.

24:40.146 --> 24:41.946
Miranda.

24:41.948 --> 24:44.248
Waiver's got to be made

24:44.250 --> 24:47.952
voluntarily, knowingly,
and intelligently.

24:47.954 --> 24:49.186
Carl, this guy's
been there before.

24:49.188 --> 24:51.589
He's well aware of his rights.

24:51.591 --> 24:55.159
But after 12 hours,
guy would forget his name.

24:55.161 --> 24:56.193
Come again?

24:56.195 --> 24:57.194
They battered

24:57.196 --> 24:59.497
my client for 12 hours.

24:59.499 --> 25:01.131
Of course he broke.

25:01.133 --> 25:04.568
And gave us a box full
of photographs of his victims.

25:04.570 --> 25:06.537
BERG:
Supreme Court says

25:06.538 --> 25:08.505
we should look at the totality
of the circumstances--

25:08.508 --> 25:11.208
length of detention,
prolonged questioning,

25:11.210 --> 25:13.010
mental exhaustion.

25:13.012 --> 25:15.012
Carl, this guy
is a serial killer.

25:15.014 --> 25:16.247
He'll do it again.

25:16.249 --> 25:19.250
You get the stake,
I've got the match.

25:19.252 --> 25:21.185
What is it,
Ben, huh?

25:21.187 --> 25:22.253
Charge a guy

25:22.255 --> 25:24.021
with killing three girls,

25:24.023 --> 25:26.657
he loses his rights
against self-incrimination?

25:26.659 --> 25:29.627
The Supreme Court
never set hard and fast rules

25:29.629 --> 25:31.161
about length of interrogations.

25:31.163 --> 25:33.030
It is a judgment call.

25:33.032 --> 25:34.164
In my judgment,

25:34.166 --> 25:36.233
the more heinous
the crime,

25:36.234 --> 25:38.301
the more protective we must be
of the rights

25:38.304 --> 25:40.538
of the accused.

25:40.540 --> 25:42.206
Police overstepped their bounds.

25:42.208 --> 25:45.576
I'm excluding the photos.

25:45.578 --> 25:47.144
We had a warrant.

25:47.146 --> 25:49.813
Without the browbeating,
you wouldn't have known

25:49.815 --> 25:51.215
where to search.

25:51.217 --> 25:53.217
As the photos

25:53.218 --> 25:55.218
were wrongfully presented
to the grand jury,

25:55.221 --> 25:58.122
this entire indictment
should be dismissed.

25:58.124 --> 25:59.223
We have physical evidence

25:59.225 --> 26:01.091
linking him to
the crime scene--

26:01.093 --> 26:02.159
a false
electrician's I.D.

26:02.161 --> 26:05.095
It's all on the Bream girl.

26:05.097 --> 26:06.196
What about the others?

26:06.198 --> 26:07.665
Zippo.

26:08.768 --> 26:10.134
Ben?

26:10.136 --> 26:12.736
We drop the charges

26:12.738 --> 26:14.738
on the first two girls.

26:14.740 --> 26:16.924
Try it only on Judy Bream.

26:16.925 --> 26:19.109
Remember, Ben, he's being tried
for the Bream murder alone.

26:19.111 --> 26:21.679
Any mention of any priors,
we return to "go."

26:21.681 --> 26:25.049
I've watched Berg's work
for years.

26:25.051 --> 26:27.051
He doesn't try a case.

26:27.053 --> 26:28.719
He charms the jury.

26:28.721 --> 26:33.157
When he's done, they'll give
Cheney a Nobel prize.

26:33.159 --> 26:35.125
So much
for victims' rights.

26:35.127 --> 26:37.628
Dead people don't have any,
my boy.

26:37.630 --> 26:39.129
What do we got here?

26:39.131 --> 26:41.298
What we don't have is one
iota of direct evidence.

26:41.300 --> 26:44.268
Cheney can't be<i> that</i> good.

26:44.270 --> 26:45.836
He's had practice.

26:45.838 --> 26:48.138
Two priors,
no evidence whatsoever.

26:48.140 --> 26:50.207
But they caught him once, right?

26:50.209 --> 26:51.642
ROBINETTE:
Man Two.

26:51.644 --> 26:53.744
He only spent five years
in Attica.

26:53.746 --> 26:55.245
Berg represent him?

26:55.247 --> 26:57.247
Who prosecuted?

26:57.249 --> 26:58.282
Fleischman.

26:58.284 --> 27:01.235
In Brooklyn.

27:01.236 --> 27:04.187
In this business,
lightning<i> does</i> strike twice.

27:06.158 --> 27:09.126
Find out how the hell
Berg did it.

27:09.128 --> 27:11.228
How could I forget?

27:11.230 --> 27:14.365
Sally Kessler, 18 years old.

27:14.367 --> 27:17.234
An Hermes tie
wrapped around her neck.

27:17.236 --> 27:19.737
Dumped naked
into a recycling bin

27:19.739 --> 27:22.239
behind Nathan's
out at Coney island.

27:22.241 --> 27:24.141
He's using wire now.

27:24.143 --> 27:26.677
Times is hard.

27:26.679 --> 27:28.679
It's scary.

27:28.681 --> 27:31.815
Cheney sat there and smiled
while he told us about it.

27:31.817 --> 27:33.350
Wait a minute.

27:33.352 --> 27:34.918
He confessed?

27:34.920 --> 27:36.654
That was the only way

27:36.656 --> 27:38.856
we were going
to touch that guy.

27:38.858 --> 27:41.091
But he only served five
for Man Two.

27:41.093 --> 27:42.793
We're questioning Cheney,

27:42.795 --> 27:45.396
nice and polite,
getting nowhere.

27:45.398 --> 27:48.098
Soon he asked to see his shrink.

27:48.100 --> 27:50.267
We ignore him, keep on pressing.

27:50.269 --> 27:51.869
After an hour or so

27:51.871 --> 27:55.372
we hit a sore spot
and Cheney spills his guts.

27:55.374 --> 27:56.674
What's the problem?

27:56.676 --> 28:00.110
He goes and hires Carl Berg.

28:00.112 --> 28:02.813
Berg hears
about this shrink thing,

28:02.815 --> 28:04.865
starts doing a song and dance,

28:04.866 --> 28:06.916
screaming and yelling
about<i> Fare v. Michael C.</i>

28:06.919 --> 28:09.253
The case where the kid asked
for his parole officer?

28:09.255 --> 28:10.954
Supreme Court
said it's not the same thing

28:10.956 --> 28:12.122
as asking for a lawyer.

28:12.124 --> 28:13.257
Only at that time,

28:13.259 --> 28:15.859
the Supreme Court
had heard arguments,

28:15.861 --> 28:17.861
but hadn't yet handed down
its opinion.

28:17.863 --> 28:20.431
Parole officer, shrink--
could have gone either way.

28:20.433 --> 28:22.166
So you cut a deal.

28:22.168 --> 28:23.967
I got him off the streets

28:23.969 --> 28:25.235
for five to 15.

28:25.237 --> 28:26.970
Usually I take all bets,

28:26.972 --> 28:29.973
but the chance
that Cheney goes free?

28:29.975 --> 28:30.974
I'm sorry.

28:30.976 --> 28:33.711
Those stakes were just too high.

28:35.381 --> 28:37.715
And he served the minimum?

28:37.717 --> 28:39.450
Warden said he was
a model prisoner.

28:39.452 --> 28:40.718
Parole Board agreed.

28:40.720 --> 28:43.921
(<i> telephone rings</i> )

28:45.257 --> 28:47.958
Robinette.

28:47.960 --> 28:49.960
Yeah?

28:49.962 --> 28:53.397
Thanks.

28:53.399 --> 28:56.266
The Breams
are in your office.

28:56.268 --> 28:57.735
They're not alone.

28:57.737 --> 28:59.770
A lawyer, Jack O'Connell

28:59.772 --> 29:03.407
from the Connecticut D.A.'s
office, is with them.

29:03.409 --> 29:06.410
So the Brooklyn D.A. screws up

29:06.412 --> 29:09.913
and this psycho
is free to kill again.

29:09.915 --> 29:10.914
Nobody screwed up.

29:10.916 --> 29:12.750
They had to cut a deal.

29:12.752 --> 29:15.986
My daughter is dead
because of a technicality!

29:15.988 --> 29:17.354
I regret it,

29:17.356 --> 29:20.424
but the Supreme Court decided
a long time ago

29:20.426 --> 29:21.992
that when the system errs,

29:21.994 --> 29:25.295
of individual rights.
it will be on the side

29:25.297 --> 29:27.931
If my daughter had
been hit by a car,

29:27.933 --> 29:30.000
we could sue the driver.

29:30.002 --> 29:33.036
Can we sue the Supreme
Court, Mr. Stone?

29:33.038 --> 29:36.440
I assure you, Mrs. Bream,
we'll do the best we can.

29:36.442 --> 29:38.308
Maybe I can do you one better.

29:38.310 --> 29:41.378
Cheney lured Judy from
Connecticut into New York,

29:41.380 --> 29:43.914
where he ultimately held her
captive and killed her.

29:43.916 --> 29:45.916
With your assistance,
we can prosecute him

29:45.918 --> 29:47.284
in Connecticut for kidnapping.

29:47.286 --> 29:48.852
He never abducted her.

29:48.854 --> 29:50.821
Kidnapping by pretense.

29:50.823 --> 29:52.790
STONE:
When Cheney phoned with
this electrician's story,

29:52.792 --> 29:56.927
he had no idea the call was
forwarded to Connecticut.

29:56.929 --> 29:58.328
He thought she was home.

29:58.330 --> 29:59.463
He had no intent

29:59.465 --> 30:01.799
of luring her
anywhere.

30:01.801 --> 30:05.302
Oh, no. I was there
when the call came.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.838
Judy told him
that she was

30:07.840 --> 30:09.506
at our house.

30:11.043 --> 30:12.976
O'CONNELL:
With death being

30:12.978 --> 30:15.012
the ultimate result
of the kidnapping,

30:15.014 --> 30:16.513
we can toss in felony murder.

30:16.515 --> 30:17.981
I don't understand.

30:17.983 --> 30:20.684
It's simple.

30:20.685 --> 30:23.386
In Connecticut,
we have the death penalty.

30:23.389 --> 30:25.489
Yeah, it's like Chicago
in the '20s.

30:25.491 --> 30:27.090
You don't like someone,

30:27.092 --> 30:30.494
hire a couple of out-of-state
thugs to rub him out.

30:30.496 --> 30:32.029
They don't want justice, Adam.

30:32.031 --> 30:33.497
They want vengeance.

30:33.499 --> 30:35.532
An eye for an eye worked
for thousands of years.

30:35.534 --> 30:36.900
What are you
going to do, Ben?

30:36.902 --> 30:38.419
I said thanks, but no thanks.

30:38.420 --> 30:39.937
They can have Cheney
after we're through with him.

30:39.939 --> 30:42.039
If we lose, double jeopardy
prevents anyone

30:42.041 --> 30:43.841
from retrying him
on the murder.

30:43.843 --> 30:45.375
O'Connell says
he has a good shot

30:45.377 --> 30:47.511
at admitting evidence
from the prior murders

30:47.513 --> 30:50.314
to show that Cheney had the
requisite intent to kidnap.

30:50.316 --> 30:51.548
But their case is bogus, Paul.

30:51.550 --> 30:53.967
You saw the mother.
She's lying.

30:53.968 --> 30:56.385
Her daughter never told Cheney
she was in Connecticut.

30:56.388 --> 30:59.089
What jury won't believe
a grieving mother?

30:59.091 --> 31:00.290
STONE:
Cheney is an animal.

31:00.292 --> 31:01.959
Yes, he should be tried
and convicted,

31:01.961 --> 31:04.628
but, no, we shouldn't subvert
the legal system to do it.

31:04.630 --> 31:06.930
And if Mrs. Bream is
telling the truth?

31:06.932 --> 31:08.465
He committed a crime
in New York.

31:08.467 --> 31:11.401
Our law says he should be
convicted, not executed.

31:11.403 --> 31:12.870
What about his alibi?

31:12.872 --> 31:14.504
ROBINETTE:
It plays,
as far as I can tell.

31:14.506 --> 31:17.641
Sara Cheney punched into work
at 9:00 P.M.

31:17.643 --> 31:20.510
Don't coworkers
scratch each other's backs?

31:20.512 --> 31:24.014
She drives to work, doesn't she?

31:27.419 --> 31:28.485
Civil service.

31:28.487 --> 31:29.486
Can't be fired.

31:29.488 --> 31:30.954
Bennies up the ying yang.

31:30.956 --> 31:32.556
Should've taken the exam.

31:32.558 --> 31:34.892
All the postal workers
park here?

31:34.894 --> 31:35.893
Half-price.

31:35.895 --> 31:38.562
Uncle Sam picks up the rest.

31:38.564 --> 31:39.997
We keep the receipts.

31:39.999 --> 31:41.999
The Feds don't trust anybody.

31:42.001 --> 31:43.433
Here we go.

31:43.435 --> 31:44.902
Cheney, green Metro.

31:44.904 --> 31:46.970
Punched in 9:45.

31:49.942 --> 31:50.974
She covered for him.

31:50.976 --> 31:52.643
ROBINETTE:
Her friend admitted

31:52.645 --> 31:55.646
she punched her time card
for her at 9:00.

31:55.648 --> 31:58.682
Even if Cheney gave her
a play-by-play,

31:58.684 --> 32:00.651
we can't put her
on the stand.

32:00.653 --> 32:02.152
Spousal privilege.

32:02.154 --> 32:04.021
No way Cheney waives it.

32:04.023 --> 32:06.189
Oh, the Breams
are playing hardball now.

32:06.191 --> 32:09.960
The Connecticut D.A.'s motion
to have Cheney extradited.

32:09.962 --> 32:12.429
So we'll stop it.

32:12.431 --> 32:14.431
We'll get an injunction.

32:14.433 --> 32:17.200
Have you seen the
civil calendar lately?

32:17.202 --> 32:19.069
Cheney will be tried
and dead six months

32:19.071 --> 32:21.071
before we get a judge
looks at our papers.

32:21.073 --> 32:22.706
We'll get a temporary
restraining order,

32:22.708 --> 32:24.341
we'll do the papers tonight,

32:24.342 --> 32:25.975
and we'll be at 9:30
calendar call tomorrow.

32:27.947 --> 32:30.113
You got other plans?

32:30.115 --> 32:31.448
I don't know.

32:31.450 --> 32:33.650
Representing Cheney
in civil court

32:33.652 --> 32:35.652
just so we can prosecute him?

32:35.654 --> 32:37.621
I am not representing Cheney.

32:37.623 --> 32:41.491
I am representing the people
of the State of New York.

32:43.095 --> 32:45.128
<i> Your Honor, I'm sure</i>

32:45.130 --> 32:46.663
I needn't remind
this court

32:46.665 --> 32:48.565
of the full faith
and credit clause

32:48.567 --> 32:50.701
of the U.S. Constitution,
which mandates

32:50.703 --> 32:53.603
that sister states
honor each other's laws.

32:53.605 --> 32:57.240
Albert Cheney broke the laws
of the State of New York.

32:57.242 --> 32:59.609
He was arrested within
its boundaries.

32:59.611 --> 33:02.179
It would be a miscarriage

33:02.180 --> 33:04.748
to allow another state
to usurp its jurisdiction.

33:04.750 --> 33:07.150
The issue in this motion
is not jurisdiction, Your Honor.

33:07.152 --> 33:09.653
It is the inadequacy, no, the
complete inability of New York

33:09.655 --> 33:11.638
to deal with violent criminals.

33:11.639 --> 33:13.622
And you believe
that Connecticut is more able?

33:13.625 --> 33:16.460
New York has tried to deal
with Albert Lawrence Cheney,

33:16.462 --> 33:18.662
Your Honor, and at least
four young women are dead.

33:18.664 --> 33:21.665
Was he rehabilitated,
and did his five years

33:21.667 --> 33:24.001
in prison prevent recidivism?

33:24.003 --> 33:25.602
Obviously not.

33:25.604 --> 33:27.070
So the only thing left
is revenge.

33:27.072 --> 33:28.538
You tell me.

33:28.540 --> 33:30.007
You had your turn, Mr. Stone.

33:30.009 --> 33:32.476
And let's do without the
rhetoric, Counselor.

33:32.478 --> 33:34.611
If you grant Mr. Stone's motion

33:34.613 --> 33:37.748
and if he tries the defendant
and loses,

33:37.750 --> 33:40.617
we are then precluded
from prosecuting him

33:40.619 --> 33:42.686
for the murder of Judy Bream.

33:42.688 --> 33:44.087
Bottom line, Your Honor,

33:44.089 --> 33:46.223
Albert Cheney is of no use
to anyone alive.

33:46.225 --> 33:47.591
Is this forum shopping?

33:47.593 --> 33:49.226
This is a criminal case.

33:49.228 --> 33:51.595
Yes, I know, Mr. Stone,
and this is civil court.

33:51.597 --> 33:53.797
Why you want to keep
Mr. Cheney alive is beyond me.

33:53.799 --> 33:55.699
I, for one,
wouldn't lose any sleep

33:55.701 --> 33:56.800
if they flipped the switch.

33:56.802 --> 33:58.769
That's not relevant, Your Honor.

33:58.771 --> 34:00.237
I know.

34:00.239 --> 34:02.606
Unfortunately, Mr. Stone
has met the burden

34:02.608 --> 34:04.574
required by law
for a restraining order.

34:04.576 --> 34:07.611
As such, I am forced
to grant his motion.

34:07.613 --> 34:10.714
The case against
Albert Cheney stays put.

34:10.716 --> 34:14.718
May God help both of us if you
lose that trial, Mr. Stone.

34:19.124 --> 34:22.492
The M.E.'s report?

34:22.494 --> 34:26.063
Paul, are you
with me, here?

34:26.065 --> 34:29.166
We've taken flyers before,
but...

34:29.168 --> 34:32.069
You would prefer that I
let O'Connell try this case?

34:32.071 --> 34:34.137
The courts are not
your personal soapbox.

34:34.139 --> 34:35.572
Have you heard me preach?

34:35.574 --> 34:38.475
Better we bend the system
than risk letting him walk

34:38.477 --> 34:40.477
because of some
unfounded morality.

34:40.479 --> 34:42.179
Who's preaching now?

34:42.181 --> 34:43.480
You're not talking
about convicting him,

34:43.482 --> 34:44.815
you're talking
about killing him.

34:44.817 --> 34:47.851
I think my tax dollars
can be put to better use

34:47.853 --> 34:51.121
than clothing, housing
and feeding Albert Cheney.

34:51.123 --> 34:53.123
Now maybe I'm just pragmatic.

34:53.125 --> 34:55.492
The cost to the state
of a capital trial

34:55.494 --> 34:57.160
is roughly $1.8 million--

34:57.162 --> 35:00.464
that is twice the cost
of an average life imprisonment.

35:00.466 --> 35:02.132
Now who's being pragmatic?

35:02.134 --> 35:06.837
Maybe the Breams are entitled
to a little vengeance.

35:06.839 --> 35:10.540
Oh, "do unto others
as they did unto you"?

35:10.542 --> 35:13.510
We burn the homes of arsonists?

35:13.512 --> 35:16.113
We sexually abuse
those who rape?

35:16.115 --> 35:18.181
You're rationalizing.

35:18.183 --> 35:21.151
Maybe, but the New York State
Court of Appeals

35:21.153 --> 35:23.520
says the death penalty
is cruel and inhuman.

35:23.522 --> 35:25.122
And what do you say?

35:25.124 --> 35:26.256
And I say

35:26.258 --> 35:29.259
we uphold
the laws of this state.

35:33.165 --> 35:35.232
LOGAN:
<i> There was a toolbox</i>

35:35.234 --> 35:38.568
and in it, we found
duct tape, electrical wire

35:38.570 --> 35:42.139
and a Manhattan Power Company
employee I.D.

35:42.141 --> 35:43.507
issued to Mr. Cheney.

35:43.509 --> 35:47.611
We also found
a Polaroid camera in a desk.

35:47.613 --> 35:49.346
And the cumulative
effect of this evidence

35:49.348 --> 35:50.847
was sufficient to
arrest Mr. Cheney?

35:50.849 --> 35:52.015
Yes, that and the fact

35:52.016 --> 35:53.182
that he worked
for her gynecologist.

35:53.185 --> 35:54.918
Thank you, Detective.

35:57.923 --> 36:00.657
The duct tape that was used
on the victim...

36:00.659 --> 36:03.360
is there anything
special about it?

36:03.362 --> 36:05.813
No.

36:05.814 --> 36:08.265
It could be purchased
at any hardware store, correct?

36:08.267 --> 36:09.599
That's correct.

36:09.601 --> 36:11.968
Good.

36:11.969 --> 36:14.336
That narrows it down to, what--
eight million suspects,

36:14.339 --> 36:16.873
assuming the culprit
lived in New York City.

36:16.875 --> 36:19.376
Judy Bream
had an unlisted number.

36:19.378 --> 36:21.578
Whoever killed her
had to get that number

36:21.580 --> 36:22.946
from somewhere, sir.

36:22.948 --> 36:24.514
Uh-huh.

36:24.516 --> 36:26.917
Can you identify this,
Detective?

36:26.919 --> 36:29.319
That's the victim's
address book.

36:29.321 --> 36:31.321
We found it
in her apartment.

36:31.323 --> 36:32.322
Would you...?

36:32.324 --> 36:33.390
Please.

36:35.260 --> 36:39.296
Tell me, what do you see
in the back portion of the book?

36:41.533 --> 36:44.334
Names, addresses, phone numbers.

36:44.336 --> 36:46.970
And how many names--
roughly--

36:46.972 --> 36:49.206
would you say
appear there?

36:49.208 --> 36:50.941
Roughly? Uh...

36:53.745 --> 36:56.413
I would say
roughly a hundred.

36:56.415 --> 36:59.482
Would it be fair to say
that these hundred people,

36:59.484 --> 37:03.353
who were kind enough to give
Judy their phone numbers,

37:03.355 --> 37:06.356
were also lucky enough
to receive hers?

37:06.358 --> 37:07.357
Objection.

37:07.359 --> 37:09.392
BERG:
Withdrawn.

37:09.394 --> 37:11.361
Detective, you don't have
any evidence at all

37:11.363 --> 37:12.529
against my client, do you?

37:12.531 --> 37:13.730
Your Honor?

37:13.732 --> 37:14.664
That's enough, Mr. Berg.

37:14.666 --> 37:16.433
I have no further questions.

37:19.304 --> 37:23.240
MRS. BREAM:
She spent the weekend with us.

37:23.242 --> 37:25.609
She was off for the holidays.

37:25.611 --> 37:29.012
She was planning on staying
the entire week.

37:29.014 --> 37:31.648
Why did Judy return to the city?

37:31.650 --> 37:33.650
She got a telephone call.

37:33.652 --> 37:36.686
Something about her electricity.

37:36.688 --> 37:40.290
Did she typically leave the door
to her apartment unlocked?

37:40.292 --> 37:46.663
No. She had three chains
on her door.

37:46.665 --> 37:48.398
Her father insisted.

37:48.400 --> 37:52.102
You'd ring the bell

37:52.103 --> 37:55.805
and then she'd double-check,
you know, through the peephole.

37:55.807 --> 37:59.276
When was the last time
you spoke to Judy?

37:59.278 --> 38:02.012
It was that night.

38:03.282 --> 38:05.548
I had her on the phone.

38:05.550 --> 38:07.417
The doorbell rang

38:07.419 --> 38:09.486
and she went to answer it.

38:09.488 --> 38:11.721
Did she put you
on hold?

38:11.723 --> 38:15.358
No. She had a portable phone.

38:15.360 --> 38:18.795
What, if anything,
did you hear then, Mrs. Bream?

38:21.667 --> 38:24.467
I heard her call

38:24.469 --> 38:27.437
to the man through the door.

38:27.439 --> 38:29.606
Did you hear his response?

38:31.710 --> 38:33.777
STONE:
Mrs. Bream?

38:35.747 --> 38:38.315
Mrs. Bream,
did you hear

38:38.317 --> 38:39.616
his response?

38:41.720 --> 38:42.719
Yes.

38:42.721 --> 38:44.087
What did
he say?

38:44.089 --> 38:45.722
Calls for hearsay, Your Honor.

38:45.724 --> 38:47.691
Statement against penal
interest, Your Honor.

38:47.693 --> 38:49.659
Not if my client didn't say it.

38:49.661 --> 38:51.594
Sustained.

38:52.731 --> 38:54.798
No more questions.

39:04.543 --> 39:08.078
I'm truly sorry
about your daughter, Mrs. Bream.

39:10.082 --> 39:13.350
I'll try to make this short.

39:13.352 --> 39:16.686
The voice
that you said you heard...

39:16.688 --> 39:17.654
I heard it.

39:17.656 --> 39:19.122
And do you think

39:19.124 --> 39:23.593
that you could, uh,
recognize the voice?

39:25.564 --> 39:27.364
No.

39:27.366 --> 39:31.534
Because it was through the door,
isn't that right?

39:33.505 --> 39:35.638
So...

39:35.640 --> 39:38.508
all you're sure of

39:38.510 --> 39:41.711
is that it was a man
at the door.

39:43.849 --> 39:48.685
Would you consider that you
and Judy were fairly close?

39:48.687 --> 39:51.521
She was my daughter.

39:51.523 --> 39:53.089
She ever tell you

39:53.091 --> 39:54.891
about any of her friends?

40:00.432 --> 40:03.800
Do you recall her
ever mentioning...

40:03.802 --> 40:06.636
someone by the name of Finkel?

40:06.638 --> 40:08.671
Robert,
I think it was.

40:08.673 --> 40:11.474
Was he one
of her friends?

40:11.476 --> 40:13.710
Ahem. Yes.

40:13.712 --> 40:16.913
And Michael Schwartz?

40:16.915 --> 40:19.883
Yes.

40:19.885 --> 40:21.885
And Steve Eidler?

40:24.723 --> 40:26.756
Yes, but...

40:26.758 --> 40:28.658
And Brian Sherman,

40:28.660 --> 40:32.829
Peter Brav, and Alan Sklar?

40:35.700 --> 40:38.568
Now, tell me,
Mrs. Bream.

40:38.570 --> 40:42.739
Isn't it<i> possible</i>
that it was Robert Finkel

40:42.741 --> 40:43.973
or Michael Schwartz,

40:43.975 --> 40:46.810
Steve Eidler,
Peter Brav,

40:46.812 --> 40:49.779
Brian Sherman, or Alan Sklar

40:49.781 --> 40:52.182
who was at the door that night?

40:56.188 --> 41:00.623
Why are you doing this?

41:00.625 --> 41:05.528
Sh... sh... she was my daughter.

41:05.530 --> 41:08.231
No further questions,
Your Honor.

41:09.468 --> 41:11.935
He took her from me.

41:18.677 --> 41:21.678
Berg's got them
eating out of his hand.

41:21.680 --> 41:23.613
Yeah. I had a professor
in law school

41:23.615 --> 41:25.882
who said the case is won
by an attorney

41:25.884 --> 41:27.817
who is better liked
by the jury.

41:27.819 --> 41:30.753
Laws, facts, truth--
nothing to do with it.

41:30.755 --> 41:34.524
Maybe in a contract case,
but this is a serial killer.

41:34.526 --> 41:35.758
The jury doesn't know that.

41:35.760 --> 41:36.759
What do you got left?

41:36.761 --> 41:38.595
C.S.U. tech will testify

41:38.597 --> 41:40.597
to the duct tape
and carpet fibers

41:40.599 --> 41:42.265
found in Cheney's dryer.

41:42.267 --> 41:43.633
Circumstantial evidence.

41:43.635 --> 41:45.702
Berg will have a field day.

41:45.703 --> 41:47.770
We don't have anything direct
other than the wife

41:47.772 --> 41:49.839
and her testimony's privileged.

41:49.841 --> 41:51.774
If she's an accomplice,
it's broken.

41:51.776 --> 41:53.643
Establishing
a false alibi

41:53.645 --> 41:55.979
does not make her
an accomplice to murder.

41:57.649 --> 41:59.616
But destroying evidence does.

41:59.618 --> 42:02.719
Who do you think
washed Cheney's clothes?

42:04.890 --> 42:07.057
Wake up a judge.

42:07.058 --> 42:09.225
Get an arrest warrant
and notify Legal Aid on this.

42:09.227 --> 42:12.562
I want her
to have a lawyer.

42:15.667 --> 42:17.667
I already told the police.

42:17.669 --> 42:21.804
We went to the movies,
had dinner,

42:21.806 --> 42:26.075
I drove Albert home,
and then I was at work by 9:00.

42:26.077 --> 42:28.578
That's not true, Mrs. Cheney,
and we both know it.

42:28.580 --> 42:31.681
We spoke to a coworker,
Barbara Livingston.

42:31.683 --> 42:34.651
She said<i> she</i> punched
you in at 9:00.

42:34.653 --> 42:37.587
You didn't get to work
until close to 10:00.

42:37.589 --> 42:39.022
So she stopped for a cup
of coffee on the way.

42:39.024 --> 42:41.825
It doesn't prove anything.

42:41.826 --> 42:44.627
You're going to have to do
better than that, Mrs. Cheney.

42:44.629 --> 42:46.262
Accomplice
to Murder Two--

42:46.264 --> 42:48.731
that's a lot
of years in jail.

42:48.733 --> 42:49.844
Wing and a prayer.

42:49.845 --> 42:50.956
Silly putty
doesn't stretch that far.

42:50.957 --> 42:52.068
I don't think so, Ms. Melton.

42:52.070 --> 42:54.070
Your client washed
her husband's clothes.

42:54.072 --> 42:56.339
That's tampering,
accessory after the fact.

42:56.341 --> 42:58.641
You can't prove a thing.

43:08.920 --> 43:11.788
Take a good look, Mrs. Cheney.

43:14.726 --> 43:18.761
That's how your husband
gets his kicks.

43:25.003 --> 43:28.071
(<i> stifled sobs</i> )

43:37.749 --> 43:42.752
That morning...

43:42.754 --> 43:46.623
we read to each other.

43:46.625 --> 43:50.093
Corinthians.

43:57.702 --> 44:01.904
MRS. CHENEY:
He came home at 8:30
and he was frantic.

44:01.906 --> 44:03.339
He, uh...

44:03.341 --> 44:07.677
His shoulder had
some blood on it over here

44:07.679 --> 44:10.913
and he said
he'd been in a fight--

44:10.915 --> 44:14.417
that someone
had tried to mug him.

44:14.419 --> 44:17.720
Was he carrying anything,
Mrs. Cheney?

44:17.722 --> 44:20.189
His toolbox.

44:20.191 --> 44:23.026
Anything else?

44:23.028 --> 44:25.895
His camera.

44:25.897 --> 44:29.732
What, if anything,
did he say to you?

44:32.671 --> 44:37.674
He said that he was afraid
he may have hurt the man

44:37.676 --> 44:40.109
and he said
he needed an alibi

44:40.111 --> 44:44.080
and then he
told me to, uh...

44:44.082 --> 44:47.450
hide the toolbox
and the camera.

44:51.856 --> 44:56.759
And then... then I washed
the blood off his shirt.

45:00.799 --> 45:04.734
Why did you help him,
Mrs. Cheney?

45:06.905 --> 45:09.706
He was my husband.

45:09.708 --> 45:12.208
He was on parole.

45:12.210 --> 45:15.144
I don't know.

45:15.146 --> 45:17.447
Did you believe his story
about the mugging?

45:17.449 --> 45:19.115
Objection.

45:19.117 --> 45:20.850
Sustained.

45:22.787 --> 45:26.456
I loved him.

45:26.458 --> 45:29.258
I prayed for him.

45:29.260 --> 45:30.893
I didn't know.

45:30.895 --> 45:32.729
Didn't know what?

45:32.731 --> 45:36.466
I didn't know
that he was an animal.

45:36.468 --> 45:37.867
Objection!

45:40.872 --> 45:42.505
Thank you, Mrs. Cheney.

45:48.847 --> 45:50.213
Oh, I don't know.

45:50.215 --> 45:53.015
25 years to life is a long time.

45:53.017 --> 45:55.918
I know two people
who consider it a gift.

45:55.920 --> 45:58.020
Then you might enjoy this.

45:58.022 --> 45:59.756
The obituaries?

45:59.758 --> 46:02.892
Richard Speck, killed
eight nurses in '66.

46:02.894 --> 46:04.260
Died in prison.

46:04.262 --> 46:07.296
He was 49. Cheney's 42.
