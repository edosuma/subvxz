01:49.909 --> 01:54.914
So, you know...
usual girl stuff.

01:54.914 --> 01:57.917
She picks up the dry cleaning.
She does the food shopping.

01:57.917 --> 02:00.420
By the way,
your dr. Melfi
has excellent taste.

02:00.420 --> 02:03.423
She only shops at
the fancy- shmancy deli--

02:03.423 --> 02:07.427
the kind with the italian name
but you can't find a fuckin'
meatball in the whole joint.

02:07.427 --> 02:09.429
What else?

02:09.429 --> 02:13.433
I don't even know what i'm
supposed to be lookin' for.
What's up with this cooze?

02:13.433 --> 02:18.438
It's none of your fuckin'
business. You're on a strict
need- to- know, lieutenant.

02:18.438 --> 02:21.941
I oughta knock the shit
outta ya for what you did
to her date last month.

02:21.941 --> 02:25.445
What? I figure this girl
is somegoomahof yours,
so i scare him a little.

02:25.445 --> 02:27.947
What's the big deal?

02:30.450 --> 02:33.453
This guy
still come around?
No.
He's not her type.

02:33.953 --> 02:37.457
I told ya, he's a coward.
He nearly pissed himself.

02:37.457 --> 02:39.959
All right, anything else?
I don't wanna be here all day.

02:40.460 --> 02:43.463
Yesterday--
yesterday she got off at 9:00
and she went to bed early.

02:43.963 --> 02:47.467
That's it?
That's it.

02:48.968 --> 02:51.971
Here.
Buy yourself an iron.

02:58.611 --> 03:00.613
You ready?

03:03.616 --> 03:05.618
Decaf, right?

03:09.622 --> 03:14.627
So, how was your college trip
with your daughter?

03:14.627 --> 03:17.130
Tell ya, my life,
it's like, uh,

03:17.630 --> 03:19.632
episode of
provolone somethin'.

03:19.632 --> 03:24.137
- What's goin' on?
- My wife. All we do is fight.

03:24.637 --> 03:27.140
Can you believe it?
She's jealous of you.

03:27.507 --> 03:32.011
Is that something that you feel,
or has there been some
discussion with carmela?

03:32.011 --> 03:34.147
She didn't know
you were a girl.

03:35.648 --> 03:37.650
You know, a woman.

03:37.650 --> 03:41.154
Excuse me, a doctor.
Woman doctor.

03:41.654 --> 03:44.657
Why did it take you
so long to tell her?
I didn't tell her.

03:44.908 --> 03:47.410
You spilled the beans
when you called
to change the appointment.

03:47.410 --> 03:52.031
Let me ask you a different
question. Why a female?
Why a female doctor?

03:52.415 --> 03:54.417
You know, she asked
the same friggin' question.

03:54.918 --> 03:56.920
I sometimes wonder myself.

03:57.287 --> 03:59.789
And?
I'll tell you
what i told her.

04:00.290 --> 04:03.793
Cusomano gave me a choice
between two jewish guys
and apaisanlike me.

04:04.294 --> 04:07.297
- I picked thepaisan.
- What's the one thing
every woman--

04:07.297 --> 04:10.300
your mother, your wife,
your daughter--
have in common?

04:10.300 --> 04:13.937
- They all break my balls.
-

04:14.187 --> 04:18.190
no, i know what you mean.
They're all italian. So what?

04:18.558 --> 04:22.060
So maybe by
coming clean with me,
you're dialoguing with them.

04:22.445 --> 04:24.447
Let me ask you a question.

04:25.448 --> 04:28.451
Why do you have me
as a patient?

04:28.451 --> 04:33.456
Most legit people, they'd go a
hundred miles out of their way
not to make eye contact with me.

04:33.456 --> 04:36.459
But you--
you didn't flinch.

04:50.640 --> 04:52.642
The water's warm.
Come on in.

04:52.642 --> 04:54.644
Hey, sammy.
How are you?

04:56.145 --> 04:58.648
Just in time.
I was just gonna
make some coffee.

04:58.648 --> 05:00.650
Yeah?
How's junior?

05:03.269 --> 05:06.022
Sit the fuck down!
Down!

05:08.024 --> 05:11.027
That's how junior is, sammy.

05:11.027 --> 05:13.029
I'm with
little jimmy altieri.

05:13.529 --> 05:16.032
Yeah? You payin' jimmy
for this game?

05:16.032 --> 05:18.534
Huh, sammy?
No.

05:18.534 --> 05:21.537
Are you payin'someone
for this game?

05:21.537 --> 05:23.539
Huh?

05:23.673 --> 05:25.174
Aah!

05:25.675 --> 05:28.678
The party's over.

05:28.678 --> 05:34.183
Junior soprano is the new boss
and he ain't respectin'
old arrangements.

05:34.684 --> 05:37.186
You're lucky.
You stayed slim.

05:37.186 --> 05:41.190
You can buy
right off the rack.

05:41.190 --> 05:45.695
I wanted something special.
The boys are having
a little time for me.

05:45.812 --> 05:48.815
You're wearin'
the suit to
the dinner, eh?

05:48.815 --> 05:51.818
These guys today,
they want to be buried
in their joggin' outfit.

05:54.320 --> 05:57.824
So how's your, uh--
what's your
oldest boy's name?

05:59.325 --> 06:02.829
Rafaelle. Ralphie.
Yeah. Good kid.

06:03.329 --> 06:05.832
Yeah.
He lost his son, you know.

06:06.332 --> 06:09.969
- What do you mean, lost?
- Dead. Morte.

06:11.471 --> 06:16.476
Ah, just a--
just a fucking kid.

06:16.476 --> 06:18.594
A baby.

06:18.594 --> 06:22.598
Oh, what are we
talkin' about here?
You lost your grandson?

06:22.849 --> 06:25.852
What are you gonna do?
These fucking animals.

06:26.352 --> 06:28.855
These--
these drug dealers.

06:29.238 --> 06:31.240
The little kid used to run
around here breakin' balls.

06:31.240 --> 06:35.495
Domonique.
My namesake.

06:35.745 --> 06:39.365
Did you know about this?

06:39.499 --> 06:42.502
See? What'd i say
about this fucking poison?

06:42.502 --> 06:45.004
These kids
shouldn't touch it.

06:45.254 --> 06:49.759
I read the paper every day
about these poor pricks
overdosin'.

06:49.759 --> 06:54.514
He didn't overdose.
He killed himself.
Fourteen years old.

06:54.514 --> 06:58.017
Jesus!
Was this at
patterson falls?

06:59.635 --> 07:02.138
- Holy shit!
That was your grandson?
- Why?

07:02.138 --> 07:04.640
The kid, he took one of those
designer drugs, right?

07:05.141 --> 07:08.144
Goes to the falls,
takes a header
right off the fence.

07:08.144 --> 07:12.148
They said the current whirled
so much that his head was
bashin' on the rocks for days...

07:12.398 --> 07:14.901
before he even came up.

07:15.902 --> 07:18.905
And meanwhile,
this piece of shit...

07:18.905 --> 07:24.410
he gets to walk the streets
and sell more of this stuff
to young kids.

07:24.410 --> 07:26.913
Oh, really?

07:26.913 --> 07:29.415
What's this
motherless fuck's name?

07:33.920 --> 07:37.423
Even the coffee's old in here.
How much complaining
can you do?

07:37.423 --> 07:39.926
Eventually they find you
with a broken hip.

07:39.926 --> 07:43.930
I want to make a gift of
a maganet. That's the only
way you'll get good coffee.

07:44.430 --> 07:48.434
What are you wearing?
You smell like a frenchputa.

07:48.434 --> 07:51.070
It's canoe.
Johnny wore canoe.

07:52.572 --> 07:55.575
Morning, livia.
Oh, good morning.

07:55.575 --> 07:57.577
Morning.
Hi.

07:57.827 --> 07:59.946
New arrival?
Keep moving, fella.

08:03.950 --> 08:06.586
I'm happy for you, junior.

08:06.586 --> 08:10.590
I know how long you waited
to be made boss.

08:10.590 --> 08:15.595
Just don't let certain people
take advantage of your good
nature like they did to johnny.

08:15.595 --> 08:18.598
What certain people?
Nobody got over on johnny.

08:18.598 --> 08:21.601
Nobody's gonna
get over on me.

08:22.101 --> 08:24.604
How's your jewish friend?

08:24.604 --> 08:29.108
- Hesh? What about him?
- Who ever heard of a jew
riding horses?

08:29.225 --> 08:31.727
- He owns a horse farm.
- Aahh!

08:31.727 --> 08:36.232
He's tony's friend, not mine.
What do you got
against him anyway?

08:36.232 --> 08:39.235
Who, me? Nothing.

08:39.235 --> 08:43.739
Johnny liked him, and my son
thinks that every word
that comes out of his mouth...

08:43.739 --> 08:45.741
is pure gold.

08:47.743 --> 08:51.247
Are you tellin' me that
since i'm the new boss
i should tax hesh?

08:54.750 --> 08:56.252
Heh!

08:56.752 --> 09:00.756
Boy, anthony must've really
gotten under your collar.
Admit it.

09:00.756 --> 09:03.759
You're lookin'
to crack hiscalione
for puttin' you in here.

09:03.893 --> 09:06.896
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.
Yeah.

09:07.263 --> 09:10.266
And i'm playin'
shortstop for the mets.

09:11.767 --> 09:14.770
Oh, all right,
watch the balls!

09:26.782 --> 09:29.285
What is the matter?

09:29.285 --> 09:31.787
Tony's cannoli doesn't want
to stand up?

09:32.288 --> 09:34.790
Tony's cannoli's tired.

09:34.790 --> 09:37.293
But i can make it
happen, baby.

09:37.293 --> 09:40.796
I know.
It's just, maybe--

09:43.799 --> 09:45.801
so how's your job?

09:45.801 --> 09:48.804
Huh?
Since when do you
care about my job?

09:49.305 --> 09:51.307
Can't i be nice?

09:52.308 --> 09:55.811
All right. Forget it.

09:55.811 --> 09:58.314
Mmm.

09:58.314 --> 10:01.067
Okay, you don't want to talk
about your job? Fine.

10:02.068 --> 10:04.570
Here. Tell somebody
who gives a fuck.

10:04.570 --> 10:09.075
I'm not a fucking whore!
Stick your money up your ass.

10:09.075 --> 10:12.078
I don't know
what's wrong with you,
but don't take it out on me.

10:12.078 --> 10:15.581
Hey, there's nothing wrong
with me! Just wanted
to talk, that's all.

10:15.581 --> 10:18.584
For all the conversation
i get around here, i might
as well be a fuckin' dildo!

10:18.584 --> 10:22.588
If you were a dildo,
we wouldn't be fighting.

10:22.588 --> 10:26.475
What does that mean?
Huh, you fuckin' refugee?
What does that mean?

10:26.475 --> 10:29.478
- Aah!
-

10:29.478 --> 10:31.981
come here!

10:31.981 --> 10:33.983
Knock you out,
you fuckin' communist cunt!

10:33.983 --> 10:35.985
Hey, hey, hey!

10:39.989 --> 10:41.991
Yeah, same to you!

10:42.992 --> 10:44.994
You fuckin' burned me!

10:47.246 --> 10:49.248
Angela.

10:51.751 --> 10:53.753
What do you got, andrea?

11:02.011 --> 11:04.013
Clabby?
Hearts.

11:04.513 --> 11:08.017
Jump in,
the water's warm.
Child's play.

11:08.017 --> 11:10.019
Pound a point.

11:13.522 --> 11:16.525
Hesh is outside.
Tell him to come in.

11:17.526 --> 11:20.029
He says he needs
a word with you.

11:20.029 --> 11:23.032
What the fuck.
I've eaten more queens
than lancelot.

11:29.789 --> 11:31.791
What's up?

11:31.791 --> 11:33.793
Let's walk.
That serious?

11:36.295 --> 11:38.297
You spoke to
your uncle lately?

11:38.297 --> 11:41.300
Junior? Yeah.

11:41.801 --> 11:44.804
No.
I don't know.
Why? What's up?

11:44.804 --> 11:46.806
Your father was
a fair man, tony.

11:46.806 --> 11:50.810
What's that got to do
with junior?
Junior's not so fair.

11:50.810 --> 11:53.312
Sometimes i wish
you'd just get to
the fuckin' point.

11:53.312 --> 11:55.314
What'd he do?

11:55.314 --> 11:57.817
He's taxing me,
tony.

11:57.817 --> 12:00.319
He's taxing you?
When did this happen?

12:00.319 --> 12:03.322
Today.
Did you tell him you operated
for years without any tax?

12:03.322 --> 12:06.325
That my father loved you
and respected you?

12:06.692 --> 12:09.695
That ten cents
out of every dollar
that goes into his kick...

12:09.695 --> 12:12.581
is directly related
to your shylock business?

12:12.581 --> 12:17.086
My uncle's been boss of
the family ten fuckin' minutes,
already i gotagita.

12:17.203 --> 12:19.705
What'd you tell him?
Told him the truth.

12:19.705 --> 12:23.209
It's a reasonable request
but an unreasonable figure.
Back up a minute.

12:23.209 --> 12:26.712
What do you mean,
"it's a reasonable request"?
He's the boss now.

12:26.712 --> 12:30.716
He can call the tune, we all
dance to it. That's the way
it's always been done.

12:30.716 --> 12:34.220
You can either respect
what's been done in the past
or change the rules.

12:34.720 --> 12:38.724
Look, tony, the reason
i came over here was to tell you
with all this bullshit goin' on,

12:38.724 --> 12:41.977
i don't know if i can
stay in this area.
Where you gonna go?

12:42.478 --> 12:46.482
Hey, come on. I can sit on my
royalty checks. You forget
i wrote six gold records.

12:46.982 --> 12:48.984
No, a couple of black kids
wrote six gold records.

12:48.984 --> 12:51.987
You owned the company.
You gave yourself a co- writing
credit. Come on, hesh.

12:52.988 --> 12:54.990
Besides, i know you.

12:54.990 --> 12:57.493
You leave this action,
you're gonna kill yourself.

12:59.495 --> 13:01.997
How much does he want?
Five hundred large,

13:01.997 --> 13:05.000
plus two points monthly
on my shy.

13:07.002 --> 13:09.505
Hm! All right.

13:10.506 --> 13:12.508
Do me a favor.
Sit tight for now.

13:12.508 --> 13:15.010
Let me think about it
for a while.

14:13.319 --> 14:15.321
How was that, baby?

14:15.321 --> 14:17.823
The best.

14:17.823 --> 14:20.826
You are the best.

14:22.328 --> 14:24.330
Come here.

14:26.832 --> 14:29.335
Tony, i love your cannoli.

14:31.337 --> 14:33.839
You okay?

14:33.839 --> 14:35.841
Yeah, i'm okay.

14:36.342 --> 14:38.344
Go back to your sleep.

14:42.348 --> 14:45.100
Sure you're all right?

14:50.105 --> 14:54.610
So, what do you want
new york to do?

14:54.610 --> 14:57.112
First of all,
junior can't know
that we talked.

14:57.112 --> 15:00.115
He's gotta think
hesh came to you
on his own by himself.

15:02.117 --> 15:05.120
You are still
runnin' things.

15:05.120 --> 15:09.625
Another thing,
the arrangement, whatever it is,
can't be insulting to my uncle.

15:09.625 --> 15:12.127
Hesh's gotta pay
somethin',

15:12.127 --> 15:14.129
i just haven't
decided what.

15:20.636 --> 15:23.138
I gotta get back.
We'll talk later.

15:29.144 --> 15:31.146
How's the veal?

15:31.146 --> 15:34.650
It's like rubber.
Yeah?

15:39.154 --> 15:42.658
Tastes all right to me.
Want somethin' else?

15:43.158 --> 15:46.211
No.

15:59.091 --> 16:01.093
Hm.
Don't look at me.

16:01.093 --> 16:03.595
Compliments of johnny sack.

16:08.734 --> 16:12.237
Maybe you'd like to spend
the rest of our anniversary
with him.

16:12.237 --> 16:16.742
I was over there for
ten friggin' minutes, carmela.
Don't do this.

16:17.242 --> 16:20.746
All right, tony.
At least i know
where i stand.

16:24.249 --> 16:27.252
Why you always gotta be
so dramatic, huh?

16:27.252 --> 16:29.254
Here we go.
Huh!

16:29.755 --> 16:32.257
All right, i'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry.

16:32.758 --> 16:35.260
You don't even know what
you're apologizing for.

16:36.261 --> 16:39.765
It's our anniversary, tony.
Ours.

16:39.765 --> 16:43.769
Not yours, mine
and johnny fuckin' sacks'.
Ours.

16:43.769 --> 16:47.272
Here i was thinkin' maybe we
could get a room at the plaza
like last year, or--

16:47.272 --> 16:49.274
i don't know.
I do--

16:58.784 --> 17:00.786
i'm sorry, carmela.

17:00.786 --> 17:03.288
Huh?

17:03.288 --> 17:07.291
I just got a lot on my mind,
and i'm not thinkin' straight.

17:09.294 --> 17:13.298
Hey. I'm sorry.

17:17.803 --> 17:21.306
Should i call the plaza?
Come on.

17:23.308 --> 17:25.928
Nah, let's go home.

17:36.939 --> 17:39.942
Hey, come here.

17:39.942 --> 17:43.445
Carmela, what do you
want me to say?
I'm lost at sea here.

17:43.946 --> 17:47.950
You've changed, tony,
and i resent it.

17:48.450 --> 17:52.454
I resent it because it's
destroying what little
self- esteem i have left.

17:52.454 --> 17:56.458
I swear, sometimes i think
you skeeve me.
I skeeve you?

17:56.458 --> 17:59.461
You're the mother
of my children.
How the fuck did i skeeve you?

17:59.461 --> 18:01.964
You see what
i'm talkin' about?
Right there.

18:01.964 --> 18:03.966
"You're the mother
of my children."

18:03.966 --> 18:07.970
I feel like i'm just
someone you've chosen
to procreate with.

18:07.970 --> 18:10.973
You knew this might happen
with the prozac.

18:10.973 --> 18:12.975
Ginny torrelli's
been on it for years
and she'd hump a fire hydrant...

18:12.975 --> 18:16.478
if it could make a pass at her.
Dr. Melfi told me it affects
different people different ways.

18:16.478 --> 18:18.981
Oh. She told you that?

18:35.497 --> 18:38.000
I think before we start
today's session,

18:38.000 --> 18:40.502
we need to address
the coffee situation.

18:42.004 --> 18:44.506
It's not appropriate
of me to take gifts.

18:45.007 --> 18:49.011
- It's a cup of coffee.
- Let's just make a rule, okay?
No gifts.

18:52.014 --> 18:54.016
This mean i can't
drink mine?

18:54.016 --> 18:56.018
No, no.

18:56.018 --> 19:00.022
I'm sorry. I usually have
my answering service on
when i have a patient,

19:00.522 --> 19:02.524
but i have
a car emergency.

19:02.524 --> 19:04.526
Yes?

19:06.028 --> 19:08.030
What does that mean,
"diagnostic"?

19:09.031 --> 19:12.534
I just wanna know
what's wrong with my car.

19:12.918 --> 19:15.420
No.
No, don't do anything.

19:15.420 --> 19:17.923
No, i want to get
a second opinion.

19:19.925 --> 19:22.928
I'll-- i'll take my chances.
Thank you.

19:24.930 --> 19:27.933
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

19:27.933 --> 19:29.935
It's all right.

19:30.435 --> 19:32.938
So...how's it goin'?

19:32.938 --> 19:35.941
Good. Real good.

19:36.942 --> 19:39.444
As a matter of fact,
i think i may flush
the medication.

19:39.444 --> 19:42.948
You know? See if the changes
i'm feelin' are for real.

19:43.065 --> 19:46.068
Why would you do that?
The prozac seems to be working.

19:46.451 --> 19:50.455
Well, that might be the problem.
It might be workin'
a little overtime.

19:50.455 --> 19:52.457
What do you mean?

19:52.457 --> 19:54.459
Umm--

19:55.961 --> 19:59.331
- i'm havin' a, uh--
- reaction?

19:59.464 --> 20:01.967
You know.
A side effect from the stuff.

20:02.334 --> 20:04.336
We talked about that
when you started.

20:04.469 --> 20:07.472
Some people get insomnia;

20:07.839 --> 20:10.842
others a stomach ache
or headaches.

20:10.842 --> 20:16.481
- But it usually passes.
- Are there any other side
effects that you know of?

20:16.848 --> 20:19.851
Some people experience
a diminished libido.

20:19.851 --> 20:24.239
- They have a hard time
getting or maintaining a--
- bingo.

20:24.239 --> 20:26.742
I see.
Mm.

20:26.742 --> 20:29.745
You know, not all impotence
is a result of the medication.

20:30.245 --> 20:32.247
You sayin' there's
somethin' wrong with me?

20:32.247 --> 20:34.249
When's the last time
you had a prostate exam?

20:34.616 --> 20:37.119
Hey, i don't even let anybody
wag their finger in myface!

20:39.504 --> 20:43.008
I'm sorry,
i shouldn't have laughed!

20:43.008 --> 20:45.510
- Don't apologize.
- Oh, boy.

20:46.011 --> 20:49.264
- You got a nice laugh.
- All right, let's be serious.

20:49.514 --> 20:52.267
Hey, i'm serious.

20:53.769 --> 20:58.774
You know that depression
is also a leading factor
in impotence.

20:58.774 --> 21:03.278
When you awaken in the morning
or in the middle of the night,
do you ever have an erection?

21:03.645 --> 21:09.034
- You could set your clock to it.
- Okay, so we know it's not
a physical problem.

21:16.792 --> 21:19.795
Let's put that in
after the credenza.
Yes, ma'am.

21:21.296 --> 21:23.799
You wanna tell me
what's goin' on?

21:23.799 --> 21:26.802
I bought some furniture.

21:26.802 --> 21:29.304
Why don't we just
move into roche bobois?
Save the delivery charge.

21:29.304 --> 21:31.807
Fine.
I'll send it back.

21:31.807 --> 21:33.809
No, but you've been spendin'
like a drunken sailor
all last week.

21:33.809 --> 21:36.311
I said
i'll send it back.

21:36.311 --> 21:38.814
Mother of christ, carmela,
i didn't say that, did i?

21:38.814 --> 21:40.816
Jesus.

21:42.367 --> 21:43.986
All due respect to new york,

21:43.986 --> 21:46.488
i don't think you should be
tellin' my uncle
how to run things.

21:46.488 --> 21:48.490
You think i got the balls
to drive in from new york...

21:48.490 --> 21:51.493
and tell your uncle
how he should run
his family?

21:51.493 --> 21:56.999
I shouldn't expect to see
the statue of liberty again
if i did that, huh?

21:57.249 --> 22:00.252
- All right, look, tony. -

22:00.252 --> 22:04.256
hesh isn't only
a friend of you guys.
He's a friend of ours.

22:04.256 --> 22:09.261
Somebody has to step in
so he doesn't get fucked.
I never said fucked.

22:09.378 --> 22:12.381
And you.
Frankly, i'm a little hurt.
You should've come to me first.

22:12.381 --> 22:15.767
- Airin' your dirty laundry
in public.
- Junior knew how i felt.

22:15.767 --> 22:18.270
How would it look if i went
to you after i spoke to him?
He's got a point.

22:20.272 --> 22:24.893
Bottom line is,
what're we gonna do about this?

22:29.531 --> 22:31.533
Somethin' tells me you
have a suggestion.

22:31.900 --> 22:35.904
Junior,
if there're any flies on you,
they're payin' fuckin' rent.

22:39.291 --> 22:43.161
Five hundred is a little steep
for back taxes, no?

22:43.662 --> 22:46.415
As far as two percent
of his action,
that's up to you to settle.

22:46.415 --> 22:50.802
After all, that affects tony
as much as hesh.

22:50.919 --> 22:53.422
I'm not out to hurt anyone.

22:53.422 --> 22:56.925
God forbid i get in the way
of someone earning.

22:57.426 --> 23:00.429
Let's say one and a half
on the shy business
and 300 on the back tax.

23:00.429 --> 23:03.432
Two fifty.

23:07.936 --> 23:10.939
What'd i tell ya? Hold onto
your cock when you negotiate
with these desert people.

23:13.942 --> 23:16.445
Two fifty.

23:16.445 --> 23:18.580
All right.

23:41.970 --> 23:43.972
Mr. Soprano.

23:52.230 --> 23:55.734
You want sex?
No.

23:57.736 --> 24:00.372
Go back to sleep.

24:11.383 --> 24:15.887
You know, you have a nice body.
You ought to make it
work for you more.

24:15.887 --> 24:19.891
Oh, really?
You reveal too much.

24:19.891 --> 24:22.894
You don't want other men
looking at me?

24:23.011 --> 24:25.013
No.
When you're not with me
you do what you want.

24:25.514 --> 24:30.018
But i'm sayin' maybe
you could wear a nice,
businesslike outfit.

24:30.402 --> 24:32.404
I think i could
get into that.

24:32.404 --> 24:34.406
You want me to dress
like a man?
No.

24:34.773 --> 24:37.776
No, you fuckin' wack- a- doo,
i don't want you to dress
like a man.

24:37.776 --> 24:41.780
I'm just sayin',
maybe wear somethin'
a little more professional.

24:41.780 --> 24:45.417
You know,
like you're in business.
Fuck you. I'm no whore.

24:45.417 --> 24:49.921
No. That's not what i mean.
Not like you're in
the whore business.

24:49.921 --> 24:51.923
Oh, forget it.

24:54.793 --> 24:56.795
Come here.

25:00.682 --> 25:03.685
Is everybody in my life
bananas or what?

25:06.188 --> 25:08.440
Get over here!

25:09.941 --> 25:12.944
Come here.
Go jerk off.

25:12.944 --> 25:15.447
Yeah.
Go jerk off.

25:15.447 --> 25:17.949
Look at this.
She burned me.

25:17.949 --> 25:20.452
That's not good.

25:20.452 --> 25:22.454
What led up to that?

25:22.821 --> 25:26.324
Carmela can be
pretty violent sometimes.

25:26.324 --> 25:29.327
This added problem
that i've been havin'
that we talked about--

25:29.327 --> 25:33.331
i just thought that maybe
we needed to spice things up
a little bit. You know?

25:33.331 --> 25:35.834
If it's not the prozac,

25:35.834 --> 25:39.337
then maybe i just needed
a little jump start.

25:39.838 --> 25:42.340
So i suggest to her that maybe
she dress a little differently.

25:42.340 --> 25:46.845
Something titillating.
Yeah.
You know, maybe it'd help.

25:46.845 --> 25:49.848
So i suggested to her--

25:49.848 --> 25:51.850
not demanded--

25:51.850 --> 25:53.852
suggested--

25:54.352 --> 25:56.855
you know, maybe dress
a little sexier.

25:56.855 --> 25:59.357
But carmela
can be very sensitive.

25:59.357 --> 26:02.360
Maybe she felt
it degraded her.

26:02.360 --> 26:04.863
Not all women
are into sexy lingerie.

26:04.863 --> 26:07.365
I'm not talkin' about
dressin' like that.

26:07.866 --> 26:09.868
Then what are we
talking about?

26:09.868 --> 26:13.371
Some women are sexier
when they dress simple.

26:13.371 --> 26:15.373
You know, understated.

26:16.875 --> 26:18.877
I don't mean--

26:22.380 --> 26:24.883
fuck it.
I don't know what i mean.

26:28.386 --> 26:30.388
Like you.

26:30.388 --> 26:32.390
How like me?

26:32.891 --> 26:34.392
You play it down.

26:37.395 --> 26:42.901
Now, it's obvious you got
a killer body under there.
Don't get me wrong.

26:42.901 --> 26:44.903
All right.

26:44.903 --> 26:47.405
Not only do you
play it down,

26:49.407 --> 26:51.409
but you're gentle.

26:51.409 --> 26:53.912
Not loud.

26:53.912 --> 26:55.914
Sweet sounding...

26:57.916 --> 27:00.418
like a mandolin.

27:05.423 --> 27:07.425
Anthony--

27:14.933 --> 27:17.936
it's unfortunate that
we have to stop now,

27:17.936 --> 27:20.939
because i think
it's really important
we talk about this.

27:20.939 --> 27:24.943
Do you think you could
come back later
this afternoon?

27:24.943 --> 27:26.945
No.

27:30.448 --> 27:32.450
Till tuesday.

27:33.952 --> 27:36.454
Okay?

27:40.959 --> 27:43.461
Yeah, all right.

27:43.461 --> 27:45.463
See you tuesday.

28:10.121 --> 28:13.124
Oh, motherfucker!

28:15.126 --> 28:17.128
Ow.

28:17.128 --> 28:19.130
Shit!

28:51.863 --> 28:54.866
It's the oddest thing.
I've had this problem for weeks,

28:54.866 --> 28:58.870
but this morning i get in
and it starts right up.

28:58.870 --> 29:02.373
- And then again at the deli.
- Uh, looks fine.

29:02.373 --> 29:05.376
Are you sure?
I was told i need a new starter.

29:07.378 --> 29:11.382
Lady, as much as
i might wish to rob you...

29:11.382 --> 29:13.885
even i wouldn't try to replace
a new starter with another.

29:13.885 --> 29:19.274
- What do you mean "new"?
- New. It has everything but
the price tag hanging from it.

29:25.947 --> 29:28.316
Come on, mikey!
I didn't do nothin'!

29:28.316 --> 29:30.819
Poor kid
committed suicide
up here'cause of you.

29:30.819 --> 29:33.705
You fuckin' know me!
Yeah, i know ya.

29:36.074 --> 29:40.578
Now listen to me.
I'm gonna give ya a break.

29:40.578 --> 29:43.581
When i toss ya over--
no!

29:44.082 --> 29:47.585
If you can fly
i won't shoot you down.
Deal?

29:47.585 --> 29:50.472
No!
Son of a bitch.

30:15.613 --> 30:17.749
My goodness.

30:17.749 --> 30:19.751
What happened here?

30:23.254 --> 30:27.759
It's some sad shit.
Motherfucker said he didn't
want to live no more.

30:27.759 --> 30:29.761
He jumped.

30:36.267 --> 30:38.636
How much he give you?

30:52.033 --> 30:55.036
I thought i was the only one
junior could make look
like that.

30:59.908 --> 31:01.910
All right.
Let me hear it.

31:02.911 --> 31:06.414
Rusty irish.
What about him?

31:06.915 --> 31:10.919
He took a header off the falls.
That's the closest that
junkie fuck ever got to a bath.

31:11.419 --> 31:14.422
I got news for you.
That junkie fuck
was my biggest earner.

31:14.422 --> 31:17.926
During the football season
he moved more cards
than ten guys put together.

31:17.926 --> 31:21.062
And another thing.
A certain friend of ours
should've checked with me...

31:21.062 --> 31:24.315
before he did a favor
for the old man capri.

31:24.315 --> 31:28.186
You're losin' me.
Irish was the one who sold
capri's grandson that shit.

31:28.319 --> 31:30.822
I think you created
a fuckin' frankenstein
in junior.

31:30.822 --> 31:33.324
I created?

31:33.324 --> 31:35.827
We all agreed to let
junior have his day.

31:36.327 --> 31:39.831
Let him be the lightning rod.
When lightning strikes, god
forbid, and somebody goes down,

31:39.831 --> 31:42.333
it's not a young man
with a family, remember?

31:42.333 --> 31:45.837
- We all agreed.
- Yeah, but who expected
to get raped?

31:46.204 --> 31:50.208
When jackie was acting boss no
one minded, 'cause it all evened
out at the end of the day.

31:50.708 --> 31:53.211
But your uncle-- marone!
Doesheeat alone.

31:53.211 --> 31:56.214
He doesn't even
pass the salt.
Heh heh.

31:56.214 --> 31:58.216
What about that
sammy grigio card game?

31:58.216 --> 32:01.219
That fuckin' mikey
smacked him around.
That ain't right.

32:01.219 --> 32:04.222
Come on, jimmy.
Even a broken clock
is right twice a day.

32:04.222 --> 32:07.725
Junior was right.
He had a position.
That game wasn't payin' anybody.

32:07.725 --> 32:12.230
The minute sammy grigio used
jimmy's name, it should've
been end of story.

32:12.730 --> 32:16.734
- That's right.
-

32:16.734 --> 32:20.238
what do you want me to do?
We made our bed. We sleep
in it. We're all men.

32:20.238 --> 32:23.241
But how long we gonna
continue to kick upstairs
without it hurtin'?

32:23.241 --> 32:26.244
I mean something, anything,
should trickle down over here,
no?

32:26.494 --> 32:31.883
All we want you to do
is talk to him.
After all, he's your uncle.

32:31.883 --> 32:34.636
- Come on.
- That's right.

32:48.149 --> 32:50.151
Who is it?
It's me, ma.

32:50.652 --> 32:52.654
Who?
Anthony.

32:54.155 --> 32:56.157
Open the door.

33:00.662 --> 33:03.164
I thought you were
the activities lady.
Hey.

33:03.164 --> 33:05.166
She's a real pain
in the ass.

33:05.166 --> 33:09.170
Playing bingo,
livia?
Not tonight,
honey.

33:09.170 --> 33:11.673
You know, she's a
degenerate gambler.

33:12.173 --> 33:14.175
Uh, millie?
Millie?

33:14.175 --> 33:16.177
Hmm?
My son.

33:17.679 --> 33:19.681
Handsome.

33:28.690 --> 33:30.692
So how's it goin'?

33:30.692 --> 33:33.194
Oh, what can i say?

33:33.695 --> 33:35.196
Hey, this is great.

33:35.697 --> 33:38.700
The only thing that's missin'
is that broken readin' lamp
you had by the phone.

33:39.200 --> 33:41.202
I got it downstairs.
I can bring it if you want.

33:41.703 --> 33:43.705
Shh, shh, shh.
Listen.

33:44.205 --> 33:46.708
Oh, she's
driving me crazy.
Who?

33:46.708 --> 33:50.211
Next door!
There it is again.

33:50.211 --> 33:52.213
Oh!

33:52.213 --> 33:55.717
That's enough water!
How much water
does she need?

33:56.217 --> 34:00.722
She runs
the water all day.
Water, water, water!

34:00.722 --> 34:04.726
I'm livin' next door
to gunga din!

34:04.726 --> 34:08.228
I went down to ferrara's.
I got you some biscotti.
Almonds?

34:08.228 --> 34:10.732
Yeah.
All right.
Leave'em there.

34:10.732 --> 34:14.235
I'll take'em
downstairs later
for my coffee.

34:19.239 --> 34:23.745
Uncle jun been by?
Oh...once in a while.

34:23.745 --> 34:26.246
It makes him
uncomfortable here.

34:26.246 --> 34:30.752
He's got a lot on his mind.
More responsibilities
means more headaches.

34:30.752 --> 34:34.255
Better men than him
had to work hard.
Yeah.

34:34.255 --> 34:40.261
He'll be all right...
long as he remembers
who his friends are.

34:42.263 --> 34:45.766
I'd just hate to see him mess
this up. He's been waitin'
a long time for the big chair.

34:45.766 --> 34:50.772
What do you mean?
It's not a business that
forgives bad decisions.

34:50.772 --> 34:53.775
I hate to see him making
wrong moves, you know?

34:53.775 --> 34:57.278
Especially at the start
of the game.
Why're you tellin' me?

34:57.278 --> 35:01.282
- Tell him.
- Ma...you got his ear.

35:01.282 --> 35:03.284
He listens to you.

35:03.284 --> 35:05.286
I don't know that world.

35:05.787 --> 35:07.789
No, of course not.

35:07.789 --> 35:11.292
But if anything, you know,
were to come up--
that's all.

35:11.292 --> 35:13.795
I don't want
to get involved.

35:13.795 --> 35:17.799
If you have something
to say to your uncle
then bring it up to him.

35:19.667 --> 35:21.669
Oh, i wish the lord
would take me.

35:22.170 --> 35:24.172
Come on, ma.

35:24.172 --> 35:28.676
There's probably plenty of gents
in this place that want a date
with a lovely woman like you.

35:29.177 --> 35:31.679
Look, i'm goin'
downstairs...

35:32.180 --> 35:35.183
before that
activities lady finds me.

35:35.683 --> 35:37.185
You want coffee?

35:37.685 --> 35:39.687
Yeah, all right.
Bring my cookies!

35:40.188 --> 35:43.191
Carmela, i don't
want to sound like...

35:43.191 --> 35:45.693
religion is a cure- all,

35:45.693 --> 35:48.696
but i think if tony
got more involved
with the church...

35:48.696 --> 35:52.700
it may help to expedite
things in his therapy.

35:52.700 --> 35:56.204
What's killing me
is this is
a self- inflicted wound.

35:56.204 --> 35:57.705
I pushed for it.

35:57.839 --> 36:02.343
I could deal with thegoomahs.
I knew i was better than them.

36:02.343 --> 36:06.848
As stupid as it sounds,
i viewed them as a form
of masturbation for him.

36:06.848 --> 36:10.351
I couldn't give him
what he needed all the time.

36:10.852 --> 36:13.354
You're a man, father.
You know that thirst.

36:15.356 --> 36:18.860
I was too busy with
the house and kids
to quench it.

36:21.362 --> 36:26.367
But the psychiatrist--
you know, she's not
just agoomah.

36:26.367 --> 36:29.370
For the first time i feel
like he's really cheating...

36:29.370 --> 36:32.874
and i'm the one
who's thirsty.

36:32.874 --> 36:36.377
I'm not gonna stay in
a marriage that's made--
shh. Shh.

36:36.377 --> 36:39.380
Let's not even
think about that.

36:39.380 --> 36:41.382
Divorce is for the weak,

36:41.883 --> 36:44.886
for people who never
intended on dying married
in the first place.

36:47.388 --> 36:50.391
You know, carm,
we reap what we sow.

36:50.391 --> 36:53.394
What do you mean?

36:53.394 --> 36:58.399
You admit to accepting
his dalliances in the past.
They meant nothing to tony.

36:58.766 --> 37:03.771
But you said
it was like they were
lightening the workload,

37:03.771 --> 37:07.775
providing a wife's duty
when you were too busy
with the kids and the house.

37:07.775 --> 37:09.777
You practically
welcomed it.

37:12.530 --> 37:15.533
I want you to pray
to our holy mother.

37:16.033 --> 37:19.537
Ask her for guidance
and forgiveness...

37:19.537 --> 37:22.540
so that you can get
through this as a couple.

37:25.042 --> 37:28.045
You're not without sin
in this, carmela.

37:30.047 --> 37:34.769
She's outta control.
She's spendin' money like we're
the sopranos of park avenue.

37:34.769 --> 37:38.272
But you've noticed her,
which may have been
the point.

37:40.775 --> 37:44.278
Look, before we
run out of time,

37:44.278 --> 37:49.150
i'd like to discuss
what happened when
we were here last week.

37:52.153 --> 37:54.405
How's your car?

37:56.407 --> 37:59.293
Did you steal my car
and have it fixed?

38:01.545 --> 38:03.798
We had an agreement:
No gifts.

38:03.798 --> 38:06.300
I didn't want
to see you get robbed.

38:06.417 --> 38:11.422
It was you.
You had no right
to steal my car.

38:13.424 --> 38:16.427
- I've been scared to death.
- Why?

38:16.427 --> 38:20.064
It's a violation of my privacy.
What else have you done?

38:23.684 --> 38:25.686
Answer me.

38:28.189 --> 38:30.191
I love you.

38:30.191 --> 38:32.693
Anthony--
i'm in love with you.

38:34.195 --> 38:36.697
I'm sorry.
That's just the way it is.

38:37.198 --> 38:40.201
Okay, let me talk.
No.
It's not the prozac.

38:43.204 --> 38:45.206
I dream about you.

38:45.206 --> 38:47.708
I think about you
all the time.

38:47.708 --> 38:50.211
I can't get excited
about any other women.

38:51.712 --> 38:53.714
There's nothing else
to say.

38:54.715 --> 38:58.719
I love you.
Let me start here.

38:59.220 --> 39:03.724
I know this may be
very hard for you
to swallow,

39:03.724 --> 39:07.228
but you're only feeling
this way because we've
made such progress.

39:07.228 --> 39:10.231
What?
I've been gentle.
That's my job.

39:10.231 --> 39:14.735
I listen.
That's what i do best.

39:14.735 --> 39:18.239
I've been a broad, generic
sympathetic woman to you,

39:18.239 --> 39:21.242
because that's what
this work calls for.

39:23.244 --> 39:27.748
You've made me all of
the things you feel are
missing in your wife...

39:27.748 --> 39:30.251
and in your mother.

39:37.758 --> 39:41.762
You're makin' me out to be
some fuckin' mama's boy.

39:42.263 --> 39:46.267
I'm a man...
and you're a woman.

39:46.267 --> 39:48.269
End of story.

39:48.269 --> 39:54.275
And this crap about freud
and every boy wanting to have
sex with his mother--

39:54.275 --> 39:56.277
that's not gonna fly here.

39:56.277 --> 39:59.280
I didn't say that.

39:59.280 --> 40:01.782
I want to make sure we
understand each other.

40:01.782 --> 40:04.785
Yeah, we understand
each other.

40:06.787 --> 40:09.290
You don't love me.

40:13.794 --> 40:16.297
You don't want me to come
back any more, fine.

40:16.297 --> 40:18.799
It's quite the opposite.

40:18.799 --> 40:22.303
This is all a byproduct
of progress.

40:22.303 --> 40:24.305
Has someone been
following me?

40:27.308 --> 40:29.310
Okay, forget it.

40:29.810 --> 40:31.812
I'll see you next week.

40:42.072 --> 40:44.074
All right! Let's go!

40:44.074 --> 40:46.076
Move it!
Remember when you
used to tell me--

40:46.577 --> 40:51.081
i always thought you could make
the pros. You coulda done it.
You had a swing like joe di.

40:51.081 --> 40:54.585
You're crazy.
What, you think
i'm shittin' you?

40:54.585 --> 40:58.088
Yeah, i could barely
hit. 250.
That's because
you didn't want it.

40:58.088 --> 41:02.476
Too busy chasin' skirt.
Chasin' skirt,
your average was. 500.

41:02.977 --> 41:05.479
- Yeah, what happened?
- So what is it you want
to talk about?

41:06.981 --> 41:11.986
Octavian.
You know, augustus.

41:11.986 --> 41:16.490
You fuckin' with me?
No.
Octavian became augustus.

41:18.993 --> 41:21.495
Forget about that.
Bottom line:

41:21.495 --> 41:24.999
Augustus was a caesar--
and everybody loved him,
right?

41:24.999 --> 41:29.003
You know why?
I don't know
that i give a fuck.

41:29.003 --> 41:32.006
Everybody loved him
'cause he never ate alone.

41:32.506 --> 41:36.510
Capisci?
It was the longest time
of peace in rome's history.

41:36.510 --> 41:40.514
He was a fair leader,
and all his people
loved him for that.

41:40.514 --> 41:44.518
This the one that they
stabbed in the back?
No, that was julius.

41:45.019 --> 41:49.523
I'm talkin' about augustus.
He shared his wealth,
and all his people loved him.

41:49.773 --> 41:54.778
You said that three fuckin'
times. I heard it."his people
loved him." what's your point?

41:58.782 --> 42:01.285
Remember the story you told me
about the father bull
talkin' to the son?

42:01.285 --> 42:04.788
They're up on this hill.
They're lookin' down
on a bunch of cows.

42:05.289 --> 42:07.291
The son goes to the father,

42:07.291 --> 42:09.793
"dad, why don't we run
down there and fuck
one of these cows?"

42:09.793 --> 42:12.546
You remember what
the father said?

42:12.546 --> 42:16.550
Father says,
"son, why don't we walk down
there and fuck'em all?"

42:16.550 --> 42:19.053
I told you that?
Yeah!

42:19.553 --> 42:21.555
Why don't we
fuck'em all!

42:21.555 --> 42:24.058
That's funny.

42:24.058 --> 42:27.561
Okay, i get your point.
Why don't you just
come out with it...

42:27.561 --> 42:31.065
instead of all this
augustus- octavian shit?
I don't know.

42:31.565 --> 42:35.069
Are you okay?
You been actin'
mesamortelately.

42:35.069 --> 42:38.072
I ain't seen
a long face like that
since you were a kid.

42:38.072 --> 42:43.077
I'm okay. It's just,
uh...bullshit stuff.
Don't worry about it.

42:43.077 --> 42:47.081
You sure?
Yeah, yeah.
I'm okay.

42:50.701 --> 42:54.705
Junior took the 250
you gave him and whacked it up
amongst the top five guys.

42:54.705 --> 42:57.207
You know, so he doesn't
look greedy.
Smart move.

42:57.207 --> 43:00.210
Yeah.
Your uncle may turn out
to be another harry truman.

43:00.210 --> 43:03.213
What's that mean?
Truman had a big job
thrust upon him.

43:03.714 --> 43:06.216
He didn't want it,
but in the end he made
some pretty wise decisions.

43:06.717 --> 43:10.220
So who knows?
Your uncle may turn out to be
the right man for the job.

43:10.220 --> 43:15.225
I fuckin' hope so,
'cause i'll tell you right now,
i don't want the fuckin' job.

43:15.726 --> 43:18.228
Let junior die
from the stress.

43:18.228 --> 43:21.231
It's what gave
jackie the cancer,
god rest his soul.

43:21.732 --> 43:23.734
"Boss."
Fuck it.
Who needs it?

43:34.495 --> 43:36.997
- It's nice here.
- I can't stand the smell.

43:36.997 --> 43:39.500
Shit, flies all over
the place.

43:40.000 --> 43:43.504
But i could stand here for hours
and watch'em run around.
There's a kind of beauty to it.

43:44.004 --> 43:47.007
I envy them.
I wouldn't go that far.

43:47.007 --> 43:50.511
I would.
They got no bills,
no headaches,

43:50.511 --> 43:52.513
no familycazies
runnin' around.

43:52.513 --> 43:55.516
One horse likes another horse,
they go up to each other,
they fuck. That's it.

43:55.516 --> 43:59.520
No problems,
no hundred questions,
no guilt.

44:02.022 --> 44:04.525
I don't know what the fuck
i'm talkin' about.

44:04.908 --> 44:08.028
So junior whacked up my money
and spread it around, huh?

44:08.028 --> 44:09.530
Yeah.

44:09.913 --> 44:13.167
Five bosses, 50 a pop.
Not a bad day's pay.

44:15.169 --> 44:17.671
Still, i wish it
wasn't your money.

44:17.671 --> 44:20.424
You know, it makes me
feel terrible.

44:23.293 --> 44:25.429
What?

44:28.799 --> 44:31.935
You old fuckin' jew.
Here's my share.

44:31.935 --> 44:34.938
You think i'm gonna
profit off your tax?

44:38.058 --> 44:40.060
Never entered my mind.

45:00.214 --> 45:03.217
Dr. Melfi--
there's nothin' there,
you know.

45:03.217 --> 45:05.719
You don't have to
explain nothin',
tony.

45:08.222 --> 45:10.224
This psychiatry shit--

45:10.724 --> 45:13.227
apparently, what you're feelin'
is not what you're feelin',

45:13.227 --> 45:16.230
and what you're not feelin'
is your real agenda.

45:29.860 --> 45:33.363
You're gonna stick with it,
right?
I don't know.

45:33.864 --> 45:35.866
Think you should.

45:35.866 --> 45:38.869
You do?
Uh- huh.

45:41.371 --> 45:43.874
I was jealous.
I should've told you--

45:43.874 --> 45:45.876
no, wait.
Let me finish, tony.

45:48.378 --> 45:50.380
I've been thinkin'
a lot about this.

45:53.383 --> 45:55.886
I was jealous of her ability
to help you--

45:57.387 --> 46:00.390
to be a sort of
salvation to you.

46:00.390 --> 46:02.893
I talked to father phil,
and...

46:04.394 --> 46:06.897
i wanna be that woman
in your life.

46:13.904 --> 46:17.407
Carm, you aren't just
in my life.

46:17.407 --> 46:19.409
You are my life.

46:23.914 --> 46:26.416
Come here.

46:43.817 --> 46:45.819
Okay, i'm no good
at speeches.

46:45.936 --> 46:48.939
Yeah,
you owe him a fuckin' dime,
you'll hear some great speeches.

46:48.939 --> 46:52.326
- Shut up. Let me talk. -

46:52.326 --> 46:54.828
go ahead, talk.
I was only kiddin'. Go ahead.

46:55.329 --> 46:57.698
I'd like everybody
to raise their glasses.

47:07.591 --> 47:10.594
Okay, uh--

47:10.594 --> 47:14.598
he taught me
as much as anybody,
'cept for maybe my father.

47:16.600 --> 47:19.102
Even if he wasn't my uncle,

47:19.603 --> 47:22.606
i'd be
standin' here sayin'...

47:22.606 --> 47:26.109
