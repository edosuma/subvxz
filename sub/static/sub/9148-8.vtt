WEBVTT

00:06.299 --> 00:07.799
Ohh!

00:07.799 --> 00:09.549
What's...?
What's going on?

00:09.549 --> 00:12.889
No! No!
Let me out of here!

00:12.889 --> 00:14.639
Come on!
Let me out of here!

00:14.639 --> 00:17.539
I'll fucking kill you!
You hear me?!

00:17.539 --> 00:19.539
Come on!
Where are you?!

00:19.539 --> 00:21.009
Hey, what do you want?

00:21.009 --> 00:24.149
You want money?
I have money. Tell me!

00:24.149 --> 00:25.619
You ... You alive?

00:25.619 --> 00:28.789
- Hey. Hey! You alive?!
- Shut up. Geez.

00:28.789 --> 00:30.489
What are you screaming about?

00:30.489 --> 00:33.869
Dude! I'm chained to a urinal
with a stack of bodies!

00:33.879 --> 00:36.489
Hey, did you take my pants?

00:36.489 --> 00:39.659
Me?! Are you insane?!
I'm chained here, you idiot!

00:39.659 --> 00:41.459
Oh, wh... hey, so am I.
What the ...

00:41.469 --> 00:43.419
Pants! I want some pants!

00:43.419 --> 00:44.579
- Let us out of here!
- Help!

00:44.589 --> 00:45.999
- Help!
- I'm chained to a toilet

00:45.999 --> 00:47.749
- with a lunatic in his underpants!
- Help! No!

00:47.759 --> 00:49.559
- No! I'm not the lunatic!
- Help with pants!

00:57.019 --> 00:59.019
- Hey, who was on the phone?
- My wife.

00:59.019 --> 01:01.519
I've got some good news
and some bad news.

01:01.519 --> 01:03.939
- All right, bad news.
- My marriage is falling apart,

01:03.939 --> 01:06.529
and I've been masturbating
to hentai because I'm lonely

01:06.559 --> 01:07.909
- and unable to connect with real people.
- Ohh, God.

01:07.909 --> 01:09.359
Gross.
What's the good news?

01:09.359 --> 01:11.779
Ah, the good news is that my wife and

01:11.779 --> 01:14.199
the entire Guild
Council are in sequester.

01:14.199 --> 01:18.029
So, Kano, my faithful
bodyguard and chauffeur,

01:18.039 --> 01:21.419
- who is our next victim?
- Ohh. It's too much.

01:21.419 --> 01:23.119
The Wandering Spider?

01:23.119 --> 01:25.289
Uh, those darts
had neurotoxin in them.

01:25.289 --> 01:28.679
I had a week of priapism, and
I still can't feel my toes.

01:28.679 --> 01:31.879
Dude, we have
two more to go. Two!

01:31.879 --> 01:34.799
And then we are the only people
arching Venture.

01:34.799 --> 01:37.049
Red Death.
Red fucking Death.

01:37.059 --> 01:40.439
He's next. Arches once a
year, leaves a body count...

01:40.439 --> 01:41.689
...no way.

01:41.689 --> 01:44.559
Red Death.
That's why you're so scared?

01:44.559 --> 01:46.029
Pushover ... he's like 80.

01:46.029 --> 01:47.949
Um, Professor Sterling Smart ...

01:47.949 --> 01:51.429
vaporized along with a personal
army of like 50 super soldiers.

01:51.499 --> 01:54.019
- Vaporized. Look it up.
- I will look it up.

01:54.049 --> 01:55.489
- Poof. Gone. Look it up.
- I'll ... yeah, I'll get back to you.

01:55.489 --> 01:57.569
- Look it up!
- Okay! Fine!

01:57.579 --> 02:01.379
I'll deal with Red Death alone.

02:05.969 --> 02:07.629
<i>"Do you mind if I sit here?</i>

02:07.639 --> 02:09.969
My dogs are barking
in these new shoes."

02:09.969 --> 02:13.309
"Lighter?
I use matches. I'm sorry."

02:13.309 --> 02:14.919
"They're new and made of leather."

02:14.929 --> 02:16.589
Wait, wh...
which one are you doing?

02:16.589 --> 02:19.759
- I'm doing the smoking one.
- I sent you a new code in the e-mail!

02:19.759 --> 02:22.269
Look, whatever.
Do you accept our offer?

02:22.269 --> 02:24.349
- Can we rely on you?
- The offer's fair.

02:24.349 --> 02:27.519
Off the record, the O.S.I.
will help you with your sting.

02:27.519 --> 02:29.269
The rest is up to your decoy.

02:29.269 --> 02:32.609
- You guarantee the Venture's safety?
- 100% guaranteed.

02:32.609 --> 02:35.999
We've ascertained that the Blue
Morpho's next target is Red Death.

02:35.999 --> 02:38.949
He's the most professional villain
still in the game.

02:38.949 --> 02:41.169
Red Death.
The man is a legend.

02:41.169 --> 02:44.289
Good to hear that old son of a buck
is still playing hardball.

02:44.289 --> 02:46.039
<i>"Do you mind if I sit here?</i>

02:46.039 --> 02:49.259
My dogs are barking in these new shoes."

02:49.259 --> 02:51.629
Ah, give me a break, Limb.
Just sit down.

02:51.629 --> 02:53.629
And, uh, nice hat.

02:54.029 --> 02:56.629
Yeah, same thing.
I don't remember anything.

02:56.629 --> 02:59.969
- I just woke up here.
- Well, there's got to be some reason.

02:59.969 --> 03:01.939
Dude, can you reach that pipe?

03:01.939 --> 03:03.559
This is starting to wiggle.

03:03.559 --> 03:05.389
- Yeah, here.
- What the hell?

03:05.389 --> 03:09.029
- Why is your chain way longer than mine?
- Who cares whose is longer?

03:09.029 --> 03:12.279
- What is this? 8th grade gym class?
- No, it's just weird.

03:12.279 --> 03:15.029
Okay, w-whatever.
Hold this for a second.

03:18.819 --> 03:20.209
Ohh! Sorry! Sorry!

03:20.209 --> 03:21.409
- Right on the knuckle!
- This is bad enough.

03:21.409 --> 03:22.829
- Nicely done!
- And that makes it worse.

03:22.829 --> 03:23.959
- I'm so sorry.
- Ah, it kills!

03:23.959 --> 03:26.159
Here. Pull my finger.

03:26.159 --> 03:29.719
- Seriously? A fart joke?
- No, you moron. It's dislocated.

03:29.719 --> 03:32.299
- Just pull it.
- Oh, right, right. Um, I'm sorry.

03:32.299 --> 03:33.139
Um. Uh...

03:34.669 --> 03:36.889
Ahh.

03:36.889 --> 03:39.509
Did ... Did you just do that?

03:41.000 --> 03:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:51.569 --> 03:53.359
- Which one is yours?
- Lila.

03:53.359 --> 03:56.239
That little ragamuffin
in the rain boots.

03:56.239 --> 03:57.939
<i>She won't take those off, you know.</i>

03:57.949 --> 03:59.529
<i>Not since I read her
"Paddington Bear."</i>

03:59.529 --> 04:02.029
Now it's all rain boots
and marmalade sandwiches

04:02.029 --> 04:05.199
- for that one.
- She's, uh... adorable.

04:05.199 --> 04:07.239
Yeah, she's got a lot of her old man.

04:07.239 --> 04:11.069
- I can't help but see myself in her a little.
- She sure does.

04:11.079 --> 04:14.279
Yeah, she really looks like
she does have that ...

04:14.279 --> 04:16.009
- Are you babysitting?
- Huh, what?

04:16.009 --> 04:21.019
Oh, you know, I... take care of
a lot of things ... many things.

04:21.019 --> 04:23.789
You don't have a child, Mr. Monarch.
So I figured.

04:23.789 --> 04:25.349
You ... You know who I am?

04:25.359 --> 04:27.889
What ... you've heard
of the Mighty Monarch?

04:27.889 --> 04:29.459
Oh, of course.
Big fan of your work.

04:29.459 --> 04:31.829
That marionette thing
you made for Rusty Venture?

04:31.829 --> 04:35.059
- Wonderful.
- Wow, I-I'm flattered.

04:35.069 --> 04:37.129
I... Red Death knows my work.

04:37.139 --> 04:40.169
- I mean, that's like ...
- That's my business.

04:40.169 --> 04:42.709
But we're not at the office
right now, you see.

04:42.709 --> 04:46.079
And that's the secret. You got to
separate your work from your life.

04:46.079 --> 04:49.299
It's a slippery slope once you
start living as your character.

04:49.299 --> 04:52.419
The obsession starts, the darkness ...

04:52.579 --> 04:55.969
a man can do terrible things
when he's lost his way.

04:55.969 --> 04:58.299
Terrible things.

05:02.559 --> 05:04.589
Oh, stop! Hey!

05:04.599 --> 05:06.759
Uh, no!
Stop right there!

05:06.759 --> 05:08.429
Oh-ho, this is ...

05:08.429 --> 05:12.439
I am completely not prepared
for this. Please, stop!

05:12.439 --> 05:15.569
Why doesn't this lobby have
a self-destruct button?

05:15.569 --> 05:18.739
- This is madness!
- How's it hanging, tough guy?

05:18.739 --> 05:20.689
Gah! What is going on here?

05:20.699 --> 05:23.699
Reel it in, Hatred.
This is a covert military action.

05:23.699 --> 05:26.279
Lock this place up,
take the rest of the day off,

05:26.279 --> 05:30.199
and, uh, watch where you
point that flashlight.

05:34.179 --> 05:37.629
What the hell?!
I said we were having supper at 4:00!

05:37.629 --> 05:41.259
- And it's 4:30!
- What is it, Thanksgiving or something?!

05:41.269 --> 05:42.629
Who eats dinner at 4:00?!

05:42.629 --> 05:45.099
Supper! Not dinner!
Supper! I said supper!

05:45.099 --> 05:46.999
- Oh, sorry, honey.
- Supper!

05:47.009 --> 05:49.839
I was late because
I was talking to... Red Death.

05:49.839 --> 05:51.859
God, what the...?
How did that happen?!

05:51.899 --> 05:55.709
Right? And he is the
sweetest man in the world

05:55.709 --> 05:58.509
and terrifying.
You wouldn't believe it.

05:58.519 --> 06:00.919
- He is so awesome.
- What are we gonna do?

06:00.919 --> 06:02.319
I'm not gonna kill him.
No way.

06:02.319 --> 06:04.749
No, we can't kill him.
I'll tell you that right now.

06:04.759 --> 06:06.059
The man is a treasure.

06:06.059 --> 06:09.929
If we do anything sinister,
he will murder us in our sleep.

06:09.929 --> 06:12.629
But your mighty leader
has come up with a plan.

06:12.629 --> 06:14.499
Hang on,
I've been in traffic all day.

06:14.499 --> 06:16.329
I got to piss like Secretariat here.

06:16.329 --> 06:18.499
No, Manolo hasn't finished
the downstairs bathroom yet.

06:18.499 --> 06:22.249
- You got to use the upstairs one.
- Fine.

06:22.259 --> 06:23.559
Here ...
turn around. Don't look.

06:23.559 --> 06:25.139
What?! No!

06:25.139 --> 06:27.179
- Don't piss in the sink.
- I think you mean,

06:27.179 --> 06:28.979
"don't piss in the sink again."

06:28.979 --> 06:30.979
"Again today," actually.

06:32.349 --> 06:34.179
<i>Small world, isn't it?</i>

06:34.189 --> 06:38.019
Me, a handsome billionaire
playboy super scientist,

06:38.019 --> 06:41.489
you, sent here to help me.
Maybe not sent.

06:41.489 --> 06:43.939
Maybe you're here
because you want to be.

06:43.949 --> 06:47.279
Because you're drawn here... to me.

06:47.279 --> 06:49.919
Um, we need the civilians out of here.

06:54.259 --> 06:56.369
All right, let's get
this dog and pony show

06:56.369 --> 06:59.039
on the damn road already.
Snoopy, give me chatter!

06:59.039 --> 07:02.879
The bait, a.k.a. Red Death,
is in Long Island preparing.

07:02.879 --> 07:05.379
- No movement.
- What? You're tracking agents of the Guild?

07:05.379 --> 07:08.799
How dare you!
Like dogs sniffing a cannon barrel,

07:08.799 --> 07:11.939
- you will regret your ...
- Whoa, whoa, nobody's tracking anybody!

07:11.939 --> 07:13.389
He just called me, I swear!

07:14.059 --> 07:17.389
Either that little light
show stops or your heart does.

07:17.399 --> 07:19.479
Hamilton, put it back in your pants!

07:19.479 --> 07:22.059
We're all here to take down
the Blue Morpho.

07:22.069 --> 07:26.699
- How are the decoys going?
- Wow, it's like looking into a mirror.

07:26.699 --> 07:30.489
Yeah, if the members of
Grand Funk Railroad were behind us.

07:30.489 --> 07:34.209
Yeah, uh, these disguise kits
haven't been used since the '70s.

07:34.209 --> 07:37.049
There's a whole bag
of false sideburns in there.

07:37.049 --> 07:39.949
- What happened to your eye?
- We had them removed and replaced

07:39.949 --> 07:43.719
- with a conduit to our display goggle.
- They never stop itching.

07:43.719 --> 07:45.169
I'm gonna set you up right.

07:45.169 --> 07:48.839
Now, I could dump you into a
blue speed suit and call it a day,

07:48.839 --> 07:51.389
or we could do this right,
do this with panache.

07:51.399 --> 07:53.099
Dean, go get your sweater vest.

07:53.099 --> 07:56.849
- Classic model Hank and Dean!
- I'm on it!

07:56.849 --> 07:59.769
- Uh, your red eye is blinking.
- It is? Oh, great!

07:59.769 --> 08:02.939
That's an e-mail I can't
read till I put on my goggle.

08:02.939 --> 08:04.939
- One, two, three, shoot!
- Once, twice, three, shoot!

08:04.939 --> 08:07.989
- Rock. You lose. One, two, three, shoot!
- Once, twice, three, shoot!

08:07.999 --> 08:11.079
- Rock. You lose again.
- Huh? Paper beats rock!

08:11.079 --> 08:12.949
No, it doesn't.
Rock beats everything.

08:12.949 --> 08:14.699
Why do you even play paper?
It's stupid.

08:14.699 --> 08:16.669
You should play rock.
It's the best one.

08:16.669 --> 08:18.949
All right, fine.
I'll guard the boys tonight.

08:18.959 --> 08:23.089
But I am keeping this on.
I look great as you!

08:23.089 --> 08:25.129
Come on, let's go.
I called my mom,

08:25.129 --> 08:27.349
and she's making
veal piccata tonight.

08:27.349 --> 08:29.469
It's good.
And I hate veal, usually.

08:29.469 --> 08:32.299
- It's veal piccata! It's great!
- Can't wait.

08:32.299 --> 08:35.299
Okay, I'm leaving now.
Don't steal anything.

08:35.308 --> 08:39.779
If you start feeling... blue, I
might be able to sneak you out some.

08:39.779 --> 08:42.029
I got your back. Wink.

08:42.029 --> 08:44.058
You gotta stop that, Billy.

08:46.119 --> 08:48.979
Don't eat that.
He's testing you.

08:48.989 --> 08:50.399
What, are you kidding?!
I'm starving!

08:50.399 --> 08:52.459
There's little hats on the
chicken legs and everything.

08:52.459 --> 08:54.119
- I'm eating this!
- Don't.

08:54.129 --> 08:56.659
It slides in here three times a day.
It's poisonous.

08:56.659 --> 08:58.489
How do you know it comes
three times a day?

08:58.499 --> 09:00.659
No, I meant...
I-I bet it comes three times a day.

09:00.669 --> 09:03.889
It's just that that's, like, recommended
because of the food pyramid

09:03.919 --> 09:06.069
- with, you know, grains.
- Wait! Come on! Enough!

09:06.069 --> 09:07.669
Just ... how long
have you been here?!

09:07.669 --> 09:09.339
Weeks. I can't tell.

09:09.339 --> 09:12.009
Weeks?! And you haven't
eaten any of the food?

09:12.009 --> 09:14.729
- What ... What have you been eating?
- Uh, them...?

09:14.729 --> 09:18.209
But, like, they were fresh
and ... and mainly the butts.

09:18.219 --> 09:19.649
Not the dirty part of the butts.

09:19.649 --> 09:21.219
- That's, like gross.
- Help!

09:21.219 --> 09:23.089
- Just the ... the meat.
- Somebody help me!

09:23.089 --> 09:25.419
- The butt meat.
- He's a butt-eater!

09:26.659 --> 09:29.909
<i>Kate, can you
refrigerate my dinner in a ziploc?</i>

09:29.909 --> 09:33.199
I have an arching tonight.
It's a special one.

09:33.199 --> 09:36.579
Sure, lamb chop. You want
the roll in there with it?

09:36.579 --> 09:39.669
No, no.
It gets all mushy in the gravy.

09:41.679 --> 09:42.959
Show time.

09:42.959 --> 09:46.289
<i>You want your brownie
in there, too, cuddles?</i>

09:46.289 --> 09:48.839
Brownies?
Yes! Thank you!

09:49.239 --> 09:52.039
<i>Celebrities making out
with bridge-and-tunnel nobodies. </i>

09:52.039 --> 09:53.699
<i>Giant chicken dancing
with Richie Rich.</i>

09:53.709 --> 09:56.459
Type 0-negative one night,
50 cent the next.

09:56.459 --> 09:58.829
Everyone is welcome.
Everyone gets along.

09:58.829 --> 10:01.209
This is your coming-of-age ritual, boys.

10:01.209 --> 10:04.629
Welcome to... the Limelight!

10:04.629 --> 10:06.169
...market.

10:06.169 --> 10:08.339
So... we're coming of age
in a mall?

10:08.339 --> 10:10.719
What happened?!
That is sacrilege!

10:10.719 --> 10:13.339
- Yeah! It used to be a church.
- No! Who cares?!

10:13.339 --> 10:15.509
It used to be the best club
in the city.

10:15.509 --> 10:18.259
Now it's a damn mall!
That's sacrilege.

10:18.259 --> 10:21.729
Okay. Plan "B."
We're going to CBGB's.

10:21.729 --> 10:25.489
<i>Venture! This is your doom!</i>

10:25.489 --> 10:27.409
<i>I come for your soul!</i>

10:27.409 --> 10:30.109
<i>Die, Doctor Venture!</i>

10:31.609 --> 10:33.609
Aw, Brock gets to kick his ass tonight?

10:33.609 --> 10:35.699
You know, how come
even when I am Brock,

10:35.699 --> 10:36.859
I still wish I was Brock?

10:36.869 --> 10:40.079
That is something I've been
living with my whole life.

10:40.289 --> 10:42.239
<i>Aw, the collar is so itchy.</i>

10:42.239 --> 10:45.659
It's ... It's, like, real wool,
and I am allergic to wool.

10:45.659 --> 10:48.209
I'm allergic to you complaining.

10:49.909 --> 10:52.749
Oh, dear.
Oh, is there a problem?

10:52.749 --> 10:55.419
Sadly. We are agents of
the Guild of Calamitous Intent,

10:55.419 --> 10:57.639
sent at the behest
of your husband, Red Death.

10:57.639 --> 10:59.219
Um, he's been compromised, ma'am.

10:59.219 --> 11:01.839
He insists that you take
Lila and go to your mother's.

11:01.839 --> 11:03.639
Tell no one,
do not answer your cellphone,

11:03.639 --> 11:05.179
even if it's from his number.

11:05.179 --> 11:07.809
- This is for your own safety, ma'am.
- Ah, yes.

11:07.809 --> 11:10.599
I-I understand. Yes.
Oh, thank you.

11:11.899 --> 11:14.599
- Whoa! Smoking.
- An old man with a red face

11:14.599 --> 11:18.109
that doesn't even have a nose on
it, and he's married to a model!

11:18.109 --> 11:21.659
- He's my hero.
- Oh, we are gonna get vaporized.

11:22.449 --> 11:27.109
- Hey, Rusty, pull my finger!
- Okay, Uncle Action!

11:27.779 --> 11:29.749
I said my finger, Rusty!

11:29.749 --> 11:31.699
You pulled the pin
out of this grenade!

11:31.699 --> 11:35.209
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
- Oh, no! Cover your head, little guy!

11:37.259 --> 11:39.509
Scamp Three! No!

11:43.799 --> 11:45.969
<i>That stupid "boom" flag
went right through my kidney.</i>

11:45.969 --> 11:49.439
My dad removed it that night
with a local anesthetic.

11:49.439 --> 11:52.469
I'm awake the whole time.
I'm 8 years old.

11:52.479 --> 11:54.809
Oh, that's just terrible!

11:54.809 --> 11:57.389
Well, how did I know
you'd dive on a grenade?

11:57.399 --> 11:58.979
Because he has Venture hero blood!

11:58.979 --> 12:01.279
'Cause I couldn't take
losing another scamp.

12:01.329 --> 12:03.379
Here's something.

12:03.389 --> 12:07.169
- Rodney killed a baby once.
- Wouldn't surprise me.

12:07.169 --> 12:09.169
Oh, now, Horace!
You stop that!

12:09.179 --> 12:13.389
- Rodney never killed a baby.
- He did. He's a baby killer.

12:13.399 --> 12:14.899
Killed a sweet little baby.

12:14.899 --> 12:17.599
It was a werewolf!
A werewolf!

12:17.599 --> 12:21.349
- It looked like a rabid animal.
- Yeah, that's what he says.

12:21.349 --> 12:23.239
But what I saw
was a wee little baby,

12:23.239 --> 12:26.319
just laying there with
a silver bullet in his brain.

12:26.329 --> 12:28.579
- Wee little baby.
- Werewolf!

12:28.579 --> 12:30.439
I saved your damn life!

12:30.449 --> 12:32.329
Oh, thank you, Rodney.

12:32.329 --> 12:36.779
Thank you so much for saving
me from an attacking baby.

12:36.789 --> 12:38.619
Werewolf!
It was a small ...

12:38.619 --> 12:41.039
I thought it was
a damn ocelot, okay?

12:41.039 --> 12:44.539
- "Ocelot!"
- Okay, baby killer.

12:47.159 --> 12:49.459
In position.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.349
<i>Check. In position.</i>

12:51.349 --> 12:53.019
- In position.
- In position.

12:53.019 --> 12:54.299
<i>Jinx, owe me a coke!</i>

12:54.299 --> 12:56.019
All right.
Mine are in position, too.

12:56.019 --> 12:58.269
Let's give the Blue Morpho
a party to crash.

12:58.269 --> 13:00.269
We have villain sign!

13:00.279 --> 13:03.309
Okay, hunter.
Time to rock and roll.

13:03.309 --> 13:05.309
That felt cool when I said that.

13:06.699 --> 13:10.169
Doctor Venture!
Face your doom!

13:12.459 --> 13:15.069
Oh, my goodness!
Red Death!

13:15.069 --> 13:18.909
I'm frightened
because I'm Dr. Venture!

13:18.909 --> 13:20.409
Help me, Brock!

13:20.409 --> 13:22.329
Beep, beep-boo-boo-boo-beep,
beep, beep!

13:22.329 --> 13:24.579
<i>Go Team Venture!</i>

13:31.139 --> 13:35.429
- He's using live rounds!
- Cool! We should do this more!

13:47.519 --> 13:50.689
- Now that looks really fun.
- I love swimming at night.

13:50.929 --> 13:53.679
No, really.
I think I've met you before.

13:53.689 --> 13:55.019
Wh-What's your job?

13:55.019 --> 13:56.849
What is yours?
Professional nosey guy?

13:56.859 --> 13:58.609
You need to mind
your own beeswax.

13:58.609 --> 14:01.019
Do you mind beeswax for a living?
Get out of my wax.

14:01.029 --> 14:04.189
N-No.
I-I swear I've met you before.

14:04.199 --> 14:06.029
It's totally impossible.
I'm a loner.

14:06.029 --> 14:09.169
Yeah, okay, sorry.
I'm just under a lot of stress.

14:09.169 --> 14:11.619
Hey, could you warm this up?
It got cold.

14:11.619 --> 14:13.339
Sure.

14:14.869 --> 14:17.209
I knew it!
Maestro Wave!

14:17.209 --> 14:18.879
I fucking knew it!
You're a super villain!

14:18.879 --> 14:21.679
Okay, I'm a super villain.
Big whoop.

14:21.679 --> 14:23.549
So am I!
I'm the Termite!

14:23.549 --> 14:24.879
You know, with the ...
the helmet?

14:24.879 --> 14:27.429
- I-I'm the ... I'm the Termite!
- The Termite?

14:27.439 --> 14:30.299
Wait, with those gross mouth
grabby things on the helmet?

14:30.309 --> 14:33.559
Yes! Maxilla palps!
Those are my maxilla palps!

14:33.559 --> 14:35.309
Dude!
Eat our way out of here!

14:35.309 --> 14:37.279
You can tunnel out!
Eat me out!

14:37.279 --> 14:39.529
No, wait. No. I ...
you know what I mean.

14:39.529 --> 14:40.729
Just ... tunnel!

14:40.729 --> 14:42.649
I need the helmet.
That's how I ...

14:42.649 --> 14:44.229
I'm not really a Termite, dude.

14:44.239 --> 14:47.569
I, uh, approximate a
Termite's powers with a helmet.

14:47.569 --> 14:50.409
<i>I felt like I could've been
more in the moment,</i>

14:50.409 --> 14:54.159
- more present, you know?
- Let the neckerchief be your inspiration.

14:54.159 --> 14:56.799
Oh, don't be so hard on yourselves.

14:56.799 --> 14:58.279
Do you know if we're gonna do a reset?

14:58.279 --> 15:01.719
- Oh, gee. I tripped. Oops.
- Whoa, ow!

15:01.719 --> 15:03.799
Oh, sorry. That's mine.

15:03.809 --> 15:05.589
Hello. Red Death.

15:05.589 --> 15:07.929
<i>Your child and your
wife have been kidnapped.</i>

15:07.929 --> 15:10.229
<i>Sign away your arching
rights to Dr. Venture</i>

15:10.229 --> 15:12.599
<i>and they will be returned
safely in the morning.</i>

15:12.599 --> 15:14.649
<i>- If you don't ...
- I don't know who you are,</i>

15:14.649 --> 15:16.769
<i>but you have made
a very large mistake.</i>

15:16.769 --> 15:19.319
I have a very particular
set of skills ...

15:19.319 --> 15:22.269
skills I have acquired
over a very long career,

15:22.269 --> 15:25.239
skills that make me a nightmare
for people like you.

15:25.239 --> 15:28.249
Release my family, and that
will be the end of this.

15:28.249 --> 15:30.659
But if you don't, I will look for you,

15:30.669 --> 15:34.329
I will find you, and I will kill you.

15:34.339 --> 15:40.089
<i>Uh, okay, um... sorry?</i>

15:40.139 --> 15:41.189
- Ah, that was so scary!
- Ah!

15:41.189 --> 15:43.139
- That was so scary!
- Oh, God! Oh, my God!

15:43.149 --> 15:45.649
- That was so scary! Scary!
- That was so fucking terrifying.

15:45.649 --> 15:48.529
- We have to let them go!
- We don't have them! We can't let them go!

15:48.529 --> 15:51.819
He's gonna go all Liam Neeson!
He's gonna vaporize us!

15:51.919 --> 15:55.989
Your father always collected
friends ... presidents, movie stars.

15:55.989 --> 15:59.989
The man slept with Grace Kelly!
He even owned a boxer.

15:59.999 --> 16:01.999
So, the Blue Morpho was one of those.

16:01.999 --> 16:03.959
Well, there's no way
this new Blue Morpho

16:03.969 --> 16:06.999
is the old Blue Morpho.
It's probably somebody like him ...

16:06.999 --> 16:11.089
someone with something to prove,
maybe even someone we know.

16:11.089 --> 16:14.259
- Right, Rust?
- Well, original Blue Morpho is dead.

16:14.259 --> 16:17.179
I remember Jonas
was beside himself with grief.

16:17.179 --> 16:20.899
Kano, too, obviously.
He even cried.

16:20.899 --> 16:23.519
Kano? My dad's big, mute,
Asian bodyguard Kano?

16:23.519 --> 16:25.189
That guy had no emotions at all.

16:25.189 --> 16:27.189
- Why did he care?
- Oh, my God, Rusty!

16:27.189 --> 16:29.909
How do you not know that
they are the same Kano?

16:29.909 --> 16:31.439
It's in the Jonas Venture comics.

16:31.439 --> 16:33.909
Kano joined Team Venture
when Blue Morpho was possessed

16:33.909 --> 16:35.749
by an alien virus that made him evil.

16:35.749 --> 16:39.119
I wouldn't believe everything
you read in those comics, Billy.

16:39.119 --> 16:42.789
Except where it says I kicked
ass, 'cause I kicked ass!

16:42.789 --> 16:47.539
Well, I'm gonna join the old people
and your boyfriend and get to bed.

16:47.539 --> 16:50.459
Don't be such a stranger, Rust.
You're family.

16:51.099 --> 16:53.379
Well, heading home as well.

16:53.379 --> 16:55.849
I'm sure the Blue Morpho sting
was a wash out.

16:55.849 --> 16:57.219
Of course it was.

16:57.219 --> 17:00.519
Because the Blue Morpho
never showed up, did he? Wink!

17:00.519 --> 17:05.608
Whatever. Say good night to
your "boyfriend" for me. Wink!

17:05.898 --> 17:07.898
- We can work this out!
- There is no other way.

17:07.898 --> 17:09.898
- There's so many other ways!
- This is what he wants.

17:09.898 --> 17:11.449
- It's his plan for me.
- We could set a trap!

17:11.449 --> 17:13.529
- I'm so sorry.
- You don't have to do what he says!

17:13.539 --> 17:15.868
- You have to die. It's his plan.
- You have free will!

17:15.868 --> 17:17.618
He needs me to feed on your butt.

17:17.618 --> 17:19.118
- Oh, please don't!
- I'm sorry.

17:19.118 --> 17:20.608
<i>Oh, God! No!</i>

17:26.299 --> 17:30.249
I know you're there, Blue Morpho!

17:30.919 --> 17:33.669
Return my family or die!

17:35.339 --> 17:37.259
No, no, no!
We can explain!

17:37.259 --> 17:39.929
- Don't vaporize us!
- Your family is at your mother in-law's!

17:39.929 --> 17:42.809
I swear! Call there!
I swear we didn't touch them!

17:42.819 --> 17:47.319
You'd better be telling me the truth,
because I swear to ...

17:47.319 --> 17:49.519
Carol?
Hi, hi. Is Kate there?

17:49.519 --> 17:51.099
Yes, I'm fine.

17:51.109 --> 17:53.239
Uh, th-there's a bag
in the trunk of the car,

17:53.239 --> 17:56.459
but can you get Kate, please?
Lila needs her corn chips.

17:57.579 --> 17:59.279
Kate, Kate, are you ...

17:59.279 --> 18:01.449
Well, I-I told her
that there's some in ...

18:01.449 --> 18:03.529
Sweetie, they don't go stale
overnight.

18:03.539 --> 18:05.839
Okay, look, I'll ...
I'll come pick you up soon.

18:05.839 --> 18:08.839
Yes, yes, I'll get more on the way.
Love you, too.

18:08.839 --> 18:11.259
See? Everything is fine.

18:13.049 --> 18:16.009
So, why doesn't the Monarch
tell me everything...

18:16.019 --> 18:18.129
from the beginning.

18:21.189 --> 18:23.299
Well, look who's still here!

18:23.309 --> 18:26.139
Waiting for the good doctor, I assume?

18:26.139 --> 18:27.889
Nope. I don't have time
for your garbage tonight.

18:27.889 --> 18:29.309
I just got stood up,

18:29.309 --> 18:32.809
and I am so tired of him
making a fool out of me.

18:32.819 --> 18:35.229
I am going to go look
for the Blue Morpho.

18:35.229 --> 18:41.199
I will find him,
and I will kill him myself.

18:42.879 --> 18:45.659
And that was supposed to be
really dramatic,

18:45.659 --> 18:47.999
and I just blew it.
What button do I push here?

18:47.999 --> 18:50.799
Is it the star, the "L," the one?

18:51.719 --> 18:52.969
Service!

18:52.969 --> 18:54.469
<i>And a return volley!</i>

18:54.469 --> 18:55.969
<i>Me, me! Throw it to me!
Spike it!</i>

18:55.969 --> 18:57.469
<i>- Yes!
- Nice!</i>

18:57.469 --> 19:00.139
- Guess who's peeing?
- Well, what is this?!

19:00.139 --> 19:02.729
Good guys against the bad guys!
We're winning!

19:02.729 --> 19:06.099
- Why are you on the bad guy's side?
- 'Cause Phantom Limb left in a huff.

19:06.099 --> 19:07.849
But mostly 'cause we're winning.

19:08.429 --> 19:11.269
Fuck it.
Who wants a doc-tail?

19:11.269 --> 19:15.819
<i>The master mixologist in the house!
Hold on tight!</i>

19:15.819 --> 19:18.029
<i>Yeah, that's what I should've done.</i>

19:18.029 --> 19:21.749
But, I stayed.
Call it loyalty. Call it dumb.

19:21.749 --> 19:23.949
And she walked all over me.

19:23.949 --> 19:26.279
Women.
You don't deserve that.

19:26.289 --> 19:28.419
Nobody understands me like you.

19:28.419 --> 19:31.869
<i>It's who I am,
without this hate, I'm nothing.</i>

19:31.869 --> 19:34.929
I'm not like you.
I can't just turn this off.

19:34.929 --> 19:37.709
I'm the man who hates
Dr. Venture, period.

19:37.709 --> 19:39.709
We're all villains, Monarch,

19:39.719 --> 19:43.379
and with rules, we get to
spill blood and taste victory.

19:43.389 --> 19:47.799
Heck, I really wanted to kill
someone tonight, you know?

19:47.809 --> 19:50.359
But... rules.
They help us hate.

19:50.359 --> 19:52.109
Yeah, I tried to tell him that.

19:52.109 --> 19:54.729
Oh, shut up.
This was your idea.

19:54.729 --> 19:57.199
I was young once too, Monarch.

19:57.199 --> 20:02.619
I hated Professor Cadmium so bad.
It was all I thought about.

20:02.619 --> 20:05.409
But, you know, I found a way
to deal with my obsession.

20:05.409 --> 20:07.739
What did you do?
I'll try anything at this point.

20:07.739 --> 20:11.709
I took a deep breath,
I marched right up to him,

20:11.709 --> 20:13.329
looked him right in the eye

20:13.329 --> 20:15.579
then crushed
his skull with my bare hands!

20:15.579 --> 20:17.379
Before I burned his house
to the ground,

20:17.389 --> 20:20.389
I slaughtered his entire family.

20:20.389 --> 20:23.219
And you're the first to know that.

20:23.229 --> 20:26.639
Finish your task, Blue Morpho,
then change your ways.

20:26.649 --> 20:28.649
You are so ...

20:28.649 --> 20:31.399
If I were a woman,
I would never stop calling you.

20:31.399 --> 20:33.179
Dude, I don't get how
you can kill like that, though.

20:33.189 --> 20:35.769
Like, don't you ever feel sad?

20:35.769 --> 20:38.819
Me? You've killed a list of
villains from what I've heard.

20:38.819 --> 20:43.939
Well, not quite. Um...
I got to show you guys something.

20:50.949 --> 20:54.869
For you, my masters!

20:54.869 --> 20:57.419
I am all villains now!

20:57.429 --> 20:59.509
- What is your bidding?
- What happened in here?!

20:59.509 --> 21:02.799
- You guys weren't supposed to kill each other!
- Oh, that's a real ...

21:02.799 --> 21:05.629
You know, if you don't mind,

21:05.629 --> 21:10.889
I could solve your problem
and feed my... problem, as well.

21:10.889 --> 21:14.309
<i>- I'll only need a few minutes.
- Yeah, sure. Just clean up the bodies</i>

21:14.309 --> 21:16.889
<i>with your vaporizing trick
when you're done or something.</i>

21:18.149 --> 21:20.059
Ow! I didn't know!

21:20.069 --> 21:22.149
Why didn't you tell me we
had a bathroom down here?

21:50.179 --> 21:53.899
<i>When we meet again,
it will be as enemies, won't it? </i>

21:53.899 --> 21:56.319
No. Never!
You're my friend.

21:56.319 --> 21:58.899
You're my ... my best friend.

21:58.899 --> 22:01.149
Don't, man.
It's ... it's too hard.

22:01.159 --> 22:04.659
How will I know you if we
meet again? I must know.

22:05.779 --> 22:08.529
Because you'll see this ...
the woman who loves you.

22:08.529 --> 22:12.529
Yes, I am a woman.
And how will I recognize you?

22:14.119 --> 22:16.869
Because I had the top
of my skull removed,

22:16.869 --> 22:20.399
and I have this plastic dome
with tubes coming out of it.
