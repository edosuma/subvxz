WEBVTT

00:03.817 --> 00:06.605
Just after 7pm she started
looking in a lot of pain,

00:06.650 --> 00:07.674
according to him,

00:07.710 --> 00:10.693
and within ten minutes,
he'd given her three injections.

00:10.710 --> 00:12.662
So you charge me
with assisted suicide

00:12.678 --> 00:14.078
and they bump it up
to manslaughter.

00:14.642 --> 00:17.650
An immediate custodial sentence
in the upper range of 8-10 years

00:17.666 --> 00:19.694
is the minimum
that should be considered.

00:19.710 --> 00:21.710
What exactly are you telling me,
Mr Schaeffer?

00:21.726 --> 00:24.650
We're just trying to locate
Mr Blakely, Your Honour.

00:24.662 --> 00:25.702
He's bolted.

00:25.718 --> 00:28.670
Well, I'm down near Gerringong,
which is not good news.

00:28.682 --> 00:29.670
Why?

00:29.686 --> 00:32.650
Because a bushwalker
just found Steve Blakely's body.

00:32.662 --> 00:33.702
Car park of the Lions Gate Hotel.

00:33.714 --> 00:35.650
Blakely and Novak?

00:35.666 --> 00:38.646
Blakely pulled this file out
two days before he died.

00:38.662 --> 00:40.638
He was going to reopen
the investigation.

00:40.654 --> 00:42.698
Oriana Vasilich.
Did Blakely have a suspect?

00:42.710 --> 00:43.718
Danny Novak.

00:43.734 --> 00:46.642
Don't fuck up what you've got
by getting involved

00:46.658 --> 00:47.698
in things
that don't concern you.

00:47.710 --> 00:49.646
What are they looking at Dad for?

00:49.662 --> 00:52.650
Because they think he killed Dianne
Vasilich's daughter, Oriana.

00:52.666 --> 00:54.706
Mr Moreno, I find you not guilty.
You're free to go.

00:54.710 --> 00:56.722
Are these photos from...
A Russian website.

00:56.734 --> 00:58.662
This is Ruby Moreno.

00:58.678 --> 01:00.839
The Vasilich family had nothing
to do with that murder.

01:01.194 --> 01:02.674
Blakely's murder's
a small part of it.

01:02.690 --> 01:04.662
If you wanna sort this mess,
ask yourself,

01:04.678 --> 01:06.682
how did Alex Moreno manage
to get acquitted?

01:06.698 --> 01:09.654
Pull out Judge Renmark's decisions
over the last two years.

01:09.670 --> 01:11.650
Why?
Something was dodgy in Moreno.

01:11.666 --> 01:14.670
I'd tread very carefully
if I were you, Ms King.

01:19.646 --> 01:21.710
They're all connected.
Blakely, Nelson, Moreno.

01:21.726 --> 01:23.678
Renmark?
Especially Renmark.

01:23.690 --> 01:25.638
He's dead.

01:25.654 --> 01:26.690
Who?
Judge Renmark.

01:26.706 --> 01:28.670
You seriously need to think

01:28.686 --> 01:30.662
about getting this Clarke guy
off the street.

01:30.678 --> 01:32.722
He's a bad man.
Get the fuck away from her!

01:33.638 --> 01:35.654
I know what you do to young girls.
You rape them.

01:35.670 --> 01:37.654
I tried to talk him out
of charging you.

01:37.666 --> 01:38.702
Doesn't matter.

01:38.718 --> 01:41.706
And the jerk is playing the victim
for all he's worth.

01:41.722 --> 01:44.674
Your Honour, I ask that this witness
be declared hostile

01:44.686 --> 01:45.966
and seek leave to cross-examine.

01:46.642 --> 01:47.654
You know he's the one

01:47.670 --> 01:49.790
who spread the rumour to the press
about you and Erin?

01:50.726 --> 01:52.682
Maya, how old were you
the first time

01:52.694 --> 01:53.934
Mr Nelson visited your bedroom?

01:54.642 --> 01:55.694
I was seven years old.

01:55.710 --> 01:57.730
He wasn't the one
creeping into Maya's bedroom.

01:58.646 --> 01:59.734
It was Dad.
You liar!

02:00.650 --> 02:02.654
He picked on me all the time.
How?

02:02.666 --> 02:04.710
Every step, I cut myself more.

02:04.726 --> 02:09.638
He didn't lift a finger.
My feet covered in blood.

02:09.650 --> 02:10.810
The feet of Blakely's corpse.

02:11.650 --> 02:13.682
Whoever killed him cut up his feet,
remember?

02:16.419 --> 02:38.113
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

02:38.646 --> 02:39.694
It's Drew. It has to be.

02:39.706 --> 02:41.642
Just because he hated his father?

02:41.658 --> 02:42.722
You've been trying to find a
plausible explanation for the feet.

02:42.734 --> 02:44.654
This is it.

02:44.670 --> 02:46.662
The pathologist's report
was inconclusive.

02:46.674 --> 02:47.714
It can't be a coincidence.

02:47.718 --> 02:49.722
Drew's clearly
psychologically disturbed,

02:50.174 --> 02:51.694
to act as a witness
against his sister.

02:51.710 --> 02:54.646
Psychologically disturbed enough
to kill his father.

02:54.658 --> 02:55.666
Hang on, hang on.

02:55.682 --> 02:57.162
We have no forensic evidence
tying him

02:57.282 --> 02:58.682
to the murder weapon
or burial site.

02:58.698 --> 03:01.674
Not yet.
He's got a watertight alibi.

03:01.686 --> 03:03.670
Drew was on his mobile to Jack.

03:03.686 --> 03:06.642
It's hard to imagine anyone else
knocking Steven Blakely off.

03:06.658 --> 03:08.698
Hardly what you lot would call
beyond reasonable doubt though?

03:08.714 --> 03:10.674
You saw how much anger
there was in him.

03:10.690 --> 03:15.642
Now's the time to talk to him.
He's rattled. Look, family.

03:15.658 --> 03:18.018
Isn't that where the vast majority
of murders are committed?

03:18.646 --> 03:20.286
It's the first place you look.
And we did.

03:20.650 --> 03:22.682
But now you have something
you didn't have before.

03:22.698 --> 03:24.690
Look, OK, I'll bring him in
for a chat

03:24.706 --> 03:26.662
and I'll apply for
a search warrant.

03:26.674 --> 03:27.722
Thank you.

03:28.638 --> 03:32.654
Interesting business in there.
Don't expect any praise from me.

03:35.654 --> 03:37.678
Let's go. Come on.

03:41.646 --> 03:44.650
Explain to me how trashing
my reputation and Erin's

03:44.666 --> 03:46.426
was going to help you get
a favourable report

03:46.646 --> 03:47.686
on your silk application?

03:47.698 --> 03:49.710
Or did you think I'd find it funny?

03:49.726 --> 03:52.682
It was a big miscalculation
on your part.

03:52.698 --> 03:54.722
You know, it's a shame
your mate Renmark died.

03:55.638 --> 03:58.359
I could have been sacked and now
enjoying life working in a bookshop.

03:58.646 --> 04:00.654
Renmark wasn't my mate.

04:00.670 --> 04:04.650
Bullshit. He's the one who told you
I was reporting on you for silk.

04:04.666 --> 04:06.690
That was Jack Rizzoli.
Jack?

04:06.706 --> 04:08.726
You cops really look out
for each other, don't you?

04:09.638 --> 04:10.730
Was he in on the scoop too?

04:11.646 --> 04:13.726
Both have a good laugh
about the big lesbian scandal?

04:14.730 --> 04:16.706
You ever do anything
like that again,

04:16.718 --> 04:18.682
I'll make sure you lose your job.

04:20.000 --> 04:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:27.690 --> 04:29.678
Hey, Andy,
you got a warrant for Drew?

04:29.694 --> 04:31.678
Turns out he really hated
his old man.

04:31.690 --> 04:32.771
That's not exactly a crime.

04:33.642 --> 04:35.282
Except if your old man's
been knocked off.

04:35.642 --> 04:38.202
We've already interviewed him. It
was the first place we started.

04:38.454 --> 04:39.694
He was pretty intense in court.

04:39.710 --> 04:43.698
Intense? The man has just lost
both his parents.

04:43.714 --> 04:45.734
Then he has to stand up
in front of the whole world

04:46.650 --> 04:48.638
and explain how his father
raped his sister?

04:48.650 --> 04:49.714
I'd be fuckin' intense too.

04:49.730 --> 04:52.670
I know, but if he's got motive,
we need to eliminate him.

04:52.686 --> 04:54.710
He's already been eliminated.
Not forensically.

04:54.722 --> 04:56.662
We've never looked at him

04:56.678 --> 04:57.714
for any physical connection
to the crime.

04:57.730 --> 05:02.662
Right.
No, that's true, that's true.

05:05.726 --> 05:07.714
If that little prick
has set me up...

05:09.662 --> 05:11.718
..that would mean that whole
phone call thing

05:11.730 --> 05:14.726
could've been bullshit.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.702
I don't understand.
I haven't done anything.

05:16.718 --> 05:18.710
I called you that night
to see if you were home.

05:18.726 --> 05:21.718
And I was. You came over to see me
for an hour or more.

05:21.734 --> 05:24.638
We talked about Dad, mostly.
You remember that.

05:24.654 --> 05:26.658
I called you on your mobile.
You could've been anywhere.

05:26.674 --> 05:29.646
I was at home.
I came home after court.

05:29.662 --> 05:31.678
Or you went straight to Steve's
to knock him off.

05:31.694 --> 05:33.658
Then you raced back here
to meet me.

05:33.674 --> 05:35.698
To let me provide you
with the world's best alibi.

05:35.714 --> 05:38.698
Because who's gonna question me,
right? That's what you thought.

05:38.714 --> 05:40.686
No. No!
Then Dianne Vasilich turns up.

05:40.702 --> 05:43.658
Very bloody handy! I do not like
to be made to look like a liar!

05:43.674 --> 05:45.682
Drew, if there's anything
you want to tell us,

05:45.694 --> 05:47.690
courts like an early guilty plea.

05:47.702 --> 05:48.706
What?

05:48.722 --> 05:50.718
Then you took the chance
to pay Steve back

05:50.730 --> 05:52.694
for a childhood disagreement.

05:52.706 --> 05:54.714
He was my friend!

05:54.730 --> 05:57.650
You little prick!
He was a decent bloke!

05:57.662 --> 05:58.698
He killed my mother.

06:02.670 --> 06:05.710
Seeing her like that
made him feel weak,

06:05.722 --> 06:08.722
and he couldn't handle it.

06:10.654 --> 06:12.662
What'd you do to him?

06:12.678 --> 06:14.690
I told him I was glad
he was going to jail.

06:14.702 --> 06:16.682
The arsehole. We had a fight.

06:16.698 --> 06:19.726
He was so furious,
he just kept yelling.

06:20.642 --> 06:22.443
I thought he was going to have
a heart attack.

06:24.686 --> 06:29.730
And then he pushed me.
He shoved me into the wall.

06:30.646 --> 06:32.686
I thought he was going to kill me,
he was so strong.

06:36.682 --> 06:38.670
I just wanted him to stop.

06:49.638 --> 06:51.678
Forensics found soil and
some tiny seeds in his car,

06:51.694 --> 06:53.646
under the accelerator pedal.

06:53.662 --> 06:54.718
They must have dropped
off his shoes.

06:54.734 --> 06:56.814
The dirt and the seeds are
particular from one area -

06:57.642 --> 06:58.690
Gerringong.

06:58.706 --> 07:00.714
Drew buried
Steven Blakely's body.

07:00.730 --> 07:02.722
Oh, he killed him too,
don't worry about that.

07:03.238 --> 07:04.678
His DNA was all over
the cricket bat.

07:04.694 --> 07:07.646
We assumed it was his, or he
and his father played with it,

07:07.658 --> 07:08.694
but the bat belonged to Maya.

07:08.706 --> 07:10.642
Oh, a crime of passion.

07:10.658 --> 07:12.658
He's not going to succeed
with self-defence.

07:12.674 --> 07:16.638
After he hit Blakely, Dianne
arrived through the back door.

07:16.654 --> 07:18.710
Yep. He hid in the study,
heard someone come in, yelling.

07:18.726 --> 07:21.658
Then silence,
then the same steps racing out.

07:21.674 --> 07:23.722
So, Occam's Razor
is a load of hogwash.

07:24.638 --> 07:27.646
So if anyone's to say 'I told
you so', now's your chance.

07:27.658 --> 07:28.694
The bomb attack?

07:28.710 --> 07:30.710
He says he doesn't know
anything about it.

07:30.726 --> 07:32.702
We've still got the team
looking at that.

07:32.718 --> 07:35.674
If there is anything to find,
Janet, we will find it.

07:35.690 --> 07:38.646
We've turned his house
and his car inside out.

07:38.662 --> 07:40.690
I'll keep looking, but,
you know,

07:40.706 --> 07:43.706
this could just be a messed-up kid
who hated his father.

07:43.722 --> 07:45.706
The murder of Steven Blakely
was an isolated incident.

07:45.718 --> 07:46.734
Are you serious?

07:47.329 --> 07:48.690
As much as I hate to say it,
Janet,

07:48.706 --> 07:51.694
Steven Blakely was the one who was
connected to Moreno and Nelson,

07:51.706 --> 07:53.638
and maybe Renmark too.

07:53.654 --> 07:55.650
It might be the reason
he killed Sally.

08:06.726 --> 08:10.638
Ah, Jack, sorry,
have you got a minute?

08:11.642 --> 08:12.686
See ya.

08:22.646 --> 08:26.674
Is charging Drew the right thing
to be doing at this stage?

08:26.686 --> 08:28.670
Absolutely it is, yeah.

08:28.686 --> 08:29.722
What if he does have
some connection

08:29.734 --> 08:31.674
to Moreno and the rest of them?

08:31.690 --> 08:33.674
There's nothing linking
the two of them...

08:33.686 --> 08:35.662
Because they've retaliated before.

08:36.706 --> 08:40.654
We'll keep security detail on you
as long as we need to.

08:40.669 --> 08:42.638
Don't you worry about that.
Great.

08:42.654 --> 08:45.670
So my family and I keep
living apart indefinitely?

08:45.686 --> 08:48.670
We will find out.
You can't promise me that.

08:49.670 --> 08:50.718
No, I can't.

08:52.682 --> 08:54.718
I want my life back.

09:03.682 --> 09:06.646
It's just a matter of time,
Janet.

09:07.678 --> 09:10.694
These people are rattled.
They'll make mistakes.

09:10.710 --> 09:12.694
Yeah, it's the mistakes
I'm worried about.

09:12.710 --> 09:16.710
I will sort this. That's not
a promise, but I do believe it.

09:33.702 --> 09:35.702
Thanks for coming in,
Mrs Moreno.

09:37.726 --> 09:39.706
I don't understand.

09:39.722 --> 09:42.714
There were cameras hidden
in the house.

09:43.714 --> 09:45.650
Who?

09:45.666 --> 09:48.654
The police are finalising their
investigations at the moment.

09:50.650 --> 09:52.090
We went to that house
more than once.

09:52.638 --> 09:53.734
Is that the only photo,

09:54.650 --> 09:56.690
or just the only one
you've found so far?

09:56.706 --> 09:59.638
Are there hundreds of photos
of Ruby floating around?

09:59.654 --> 10:01.670
This is the only photo we need
to prosecute.

10:09.710 --> 10:13.650
This is a still from a video.
Yes.

10:13.666 --> 10:16.694
She's taking off a bikini top.
The video didn't stop here.

10:16.710 --> 10:20.658
She'd take off her whole top,
and maybe the bottom half too.

10:20.670 --> 10:21.706
She would be naked.

10:21.722 --> 10:24.706
We don't know
where the video ends.

10:24.722 --> 10:26.702
But they wouldn't stop
at this still.

10:26.714 --> 10:28.642
They would use the rest of it.

10:28.658 --> 10:30.178
They would sell
the rest of the stills.

10:31.718 --> 10:33.706
After everything with Alex,

10:33.722 --> 10:36.666
attacking an artist's integrity,
and now this?

10:36.678 --> 10:39.658
These people have to be stopped,

10:39.674 --> 10:41.706
but we need your help
to convict Timothy Clarke,

10:41.722 --> 10:44.698
the man we found with this photo
on his computer.

10:44.714 --> 10:48.662
A photo he bought from Russia?
A Russian website.

10:51.646 --> 10:54.678
Don't they understand
that these are real children?

11:00.726 --> 11:03.642
What do you need?

11:03.658 --> 11:05.642
We need to prove
your daughter's age.

11:05.654 --> 11:06.670
Birth certificate?

11:06.686 --> 11:10.646
The defence won't accept that, I'm
afraid. We'll need you in court.

11:10.662 --> 11:13.678
Me?
Yes.

11:14.678 --> 11:15.734
And her photo?

11:16.646 --> 11:17.730
We'll need to use that too.

11:18.646 --> 11:20.734
Without it, and your testimony,
we have no case.

11:21.182 --> 11:22.702
The best thing you can do
at this point

11:22.718 --> 11:24.718
is help to convict the man
who has this photo.

11:24.734 --> 11:26.730
You'll be helping to protect
other children.

11:27.413 --> 11:29.694
By letting more and more people
see my daughter like this?

11:29.710 --> 11:32.686
Letting them imagine
what comes next?

11:32.698 --> 11:33.734
I'm sorry.

11:35.686 --> 11:37.674
I'll have to think about it.

11:47.694 --> 11:50.718
There's not too many decent blokes
left these days.

11:50.730 --> 11:53.666
All bloody corporate types.

11:53.682 --> 11:56.718
They come into the force, you know,
with MBAs shoved up their arses.

11:56.734 --> 12:01.650
They all want careers, vocational
training, KPI assessments.

12:01.666 --> 12:04.658
Whatever happened to bloody getting
scumbags off the street, huh?

12:04.674 --> 12:06.682
Andy Campbell?

12:08.674 --> 12:11.730
You're joking. Shit.
Better bring him in.

12:12.730 --> 12:14.682
Something actually go right?

12:14.698 --> 12:18.650
DNA results on items from
the Oriana Vasilich murder scene.

12:18.666 --> 12:20.702
Positive match.
Finally got the bastard.

12:23.650 --> 12:25.730
Danny Novak, put your hands
where I can see them.

12:26.642 --> 12:27.722
Oh, what the fuck!

12:28.638 --> 12:30.678
Put your hands up! Up!
Get up! Now!

12:30.694 --> 12:32.658
I haven't finished my coffee yet.
Do you mind?

12:32.674 --> 12:33.706
What are you doing?
Move!

12:33.718 --> 12:36.694
Let him go! Dad! Dad!

12:36.710 --> 12:40.674
You can't do this. He has rights.
He's got rights!

12:40.690 --> 12:43.686
Mind my head.
Dad!

13:01.662 --> 13:03.714
Tatum?
I can give you five minutes.

13:03.730 --> 13:06.702
Are you sure that's OK?
Yeah, just five minutes, OK?

13:21.706 --> 13:26.686
Sorry it took so long. Did you
get a cup of tea out of 'em?

13:28.658 --> 13:31.670
They only just put these back on.
They obviously don't trust you.

13:32.686 --> 13:35.638
Do you need anything?
Water, or...?

13:35.650 --> 13:36.710
No, no, no, I'm fine.

13:36.726 --> 13:38.726
Nobody will tell me anything
about what's going on.

13:38.730 --> 13:41.694
It's a mistake, sweetheart.
They're harassing you.

13:41.710 --> 13:43.702
No, it's just like
searching the house.

13:43.718 --> 13:46.678
They're getting their stats up
for the month, that's all.

13:49.706 --> 13:54.686
It's that girl, isn't it?
Oriana Vasilich?

13:55.730 --> 13:58.646
There's nothing in it.

13:59.722 --> 14:03.658
Well, you didn't know who she was.
Exactly.

14:03.674 --> 14:05.194
That's what I keep trying
to tell them.

14:05.646 --> 14:07.670
It was so long ago.
I mean, nearly two decades.

14:07.686 --> 14:10.682
People are bound to get things
wrong, make mistakes.

14:10.698 --> 14:14.690
Exactly. So go back to work,
sweetheart. I'll see you at home.

14:15.690 --> 14:19.690
OK. It's my turn to cook.
Yeah, can't wait.

14:24.694 --> 14:26.686
See ya.

14:39.702 --> 14:41.690
Hey.

14:41.706 --> 14:45.650
You OK?
You came.

14:45.666 --> 14:48.682
Of course I did.
They think he killed that girl.

14:48.698 --> 14:52.642
I know. Andy called Janet.
Everybody knows?

14:56.658 --> 14:59.642
They probably know more than I do,
which wouldn't be hard.

15:01.658 --> 15:03.690
How was she killed?
I don't know, exactly.

15:03.706 --> 15:06.658
Bullshit.
I'm gonna hear eventually.

15:06.674 --> 15:09.658
Her body was never found
so nobody really knows.

15:10.722 --> 15:14.642
No body. That makes prosecution
pretty difficult.

15:14.654 --> 15:15.694
Yeah, it can.

15:15.710 --> 15:17.702
And Oriana, she was blackmailing

15:17.718 --> 15:19.710
politicians
and all sorts of people.

15:19.726 --> 15:23.718
God knows what else she was up to.
Not exactly a model citizen.

15:24.718 --> 15:27.718
I'm so sorry.
There's nothing to be sorry for.

15:27.734 --> 15:30.654
I know how you feel
about your dad.

15:33.662 --> 15:37.654
My Dad never hit me
when I was growing up. Never.

15:37.666 --> 15:38.726
He never raised his voice.

15:39.642 --> 15:40.882
He read me stories every night,

15:41.646 --> 15:43.007
sitting on the floor
beside my bed.

15:43.646 --> 15:47.678
And if I got scared by a giant
or werewolf or witch,

15:47.694 --> 15:50.710
he would stay there on the floor
until I fell asleep.

15:51.710 --> 15:54.722
One morning he was still there
when I woke up, fast asleep.

15:54.734 --> 15:57.726
He never missed a sports match

15:58.642 --> 16:01.654
or a music performance
or a speech night.

16:03.718 --> 16:07.690
He cooked sausages at fundraisers
and sold charity chocolates

16:07.706 --> 16:10.690
to his workmates and
he taught me to play tennis.

16:10.702 --> 16:12.638
Come here.

16:24.694 --> 16:26.722
The Nelson jury are
on their way back.

16:26.734 --> 16:28.666
It's too quick.

16:28.682 --> 16:30.650
Doesn't necessarily mean
an acquittal.

16:30.662 --> 16:31.666
Drew's derailed it.

16:31.682 --> 16:32.730
Once he's convicted,
we've got grounds for appeal,

16:33.642 --> 16:34.682
but that's too late.

16:34.694 --> 16:36.674
They might still convict Nelson.

16:38.654 --> 16:41.722
Owen and I are heading there now...
See you there.

17:07.685 --> 17:09.705
Members of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

17:10.730 --> 17:12.726
We have, Your Honour.

17:13.642 --> 17:18.690
On the first count, that between
January 1996 and July 1999,

17:18.705 --> 17:23.662
the accused, Keith Gordon Nelson
did have sexual intercourse

17:23.678 --> 17:28.730
with a child under 10,
namely Maya Sally Blakely.

17:29.646 --> 17:32.650
How do you find the defendant,
guilty or not guilty?

17:32.662 --> 17:34.686
Guilty, Your Honour.

17:34.698 --> 17:36.650
And on the second count

17:36.666 --> 17:40.670
that between January 2000
and December 2003,

17:40.686 --> 17:45.646
the accused, Keith Gordon Nelson
did have sexual intercourse

17:45.662 --> 17:50.682
with a child under 16,
namely Maya Sally Blakely.

17:50.698 --> 17:52.738
How do you find the defendant,
guilty or not guilty?

17:53.646 --> 17:55.642
Guilty, Your Honour.

17:57.662 --> 17:58.734
Bail is revoked.

17:59.646 --> 18:01.722
You will be remanded in custody

18:02.638 --> 18:04.694
and brought to this court
for sentence.

18:15.674 --> 18:17.714
My client has been very clear
with his instructions.

18:17.726 --> 18:19.654
Come on, you and I both know

18:19.670 --> 18:20.714
he hasn't got a hope in hell
in appeal.

18:20.730 --> 18:23.650
You told him what happens
to guys like him in prison?

18:23.666 --> 18:24.694
Kiddie fiddlers aren't exactly
popular.

18:24.710 --> 18:27.678
He's adamant. We just want
some names, that's all.

18:27.694 --> 18:29.718
Can I talk to you?
Janet, I've got it under control.

18:29.730 --> 18:31.710
Nelson has information we need.

18:31.726 --> 18:33.718
You know I can't talk to you
about any of this.

18:33.734 --> 18:36.702
Please, David, I wouldn't ask
unless it was really important.

18:36.714 --> 18:38.702
I can't. I'm sorry.

18:39.702 --> 18:41.714
Thanks for trusting me
to do my job.

18:41.730 --> 18:43.662
Why would I trust you
with anything?

18:43.678 --> 18:46.650
I won the case.
Nelson's not going anywhere.

18:46.666 --> 18:48.706
Yes, he's appealing, but
he'll probably change his mind

18:48.722 --> 18:50.658
after a couple of days
in prison.

18:50.674 --> 18:52.694
A guy like him's not gonna
like it much.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.638
Too scared to come in
on the first lap?

19:13.702 --> 19:16.726
I don't bite,
despite everything you've heard.

19:17.638 --> 19:18.686
You don't stop, do you?

19:20.654 --> 19:22.662
You must be pleased
about the Nelson verdict.

19:22.674 --> 19:24.674
Relieved would be more accurate.

19:24.690 --> 19:26.698
But I'm sure you're not here
just to feed my ego.

19:28.714 --> 19:31.650
One of the first things
I was taught at law school

19:31.666 --> 19:34.714
was anyone who represented
themselves had a fool as a client.

19:34.730 --> 19:37.694
If I'm pleading
to this assault thing,

19:37.710 --> 19:40.674
should I get someone
to represent me?

19:40.690 --> 19:43.690
Well, make the plea for me?
You sure you want to plead?

19:43.706 --> 19:46.658
Well, I hit him. Never too late
to change your plea.

19:46.674 --> 19:48.730
To what?
Defence of another.

19:49.646 --> 19:52.638
Well, he hasn't been charged
with anything.

19:52.654 --> 19:54.686
I'm not supposed to know
that he's a filthy paedophile,

19:54.702 --> 19:56.654
nor am I supposed to use
my knowledge

19:56.670 --> 19:58.190
of where he lives to go
and harass him.

19:58.638 --> 19:59.718
You've been seeing a psych,
haven't you?

19:59.734 --> 20:02.650
No-one's been telling stories
out of school.

20:02.666 --> 20:04.726
Anyone in Sex Crimes
gets dragged off

20:05.642 --> 20:07.322
to see a psych
whether they like it or not.

20:07.722 --> 20:11.662
So, you get your files, and
then you do the plea yourself.

20:11.678 --> 20:13.646
It'll have much more emotional
impact.

20:13.662 --> 20:16.654
You make it all about your
panic attacks, your nightmares,

20:16.670 --> 20:18.690
your emotional distress
because of the work you do.

20:18.706 --> 20:20.698
Show that I'm incapable
of doing my job?

20:20.714 --> 20:23.646
Yeah, I'm sure you could get Tony
to write a statement

20:23.662 --> 20:25.662
saying he's worried
about your mental health.

20:25.678 --> 20:26.710
Plead insanity?
Not quite.

20:26.726 --> 20:29.682
But you want to avoid a criminal
conviction on your record,

20:29.698 --> 20:32.674
so you go for diminished
responsibility on account of PTSD.

20:52.678 --> 20:54.670
What's Moreno doing in here?
No idea.

20:54.686 --> 20:56.658
He just turned up,
wanted to see Owen.

20:56.674 --> 20:58.706
Probably pissed off about
his wife being hassled.

21:02.718 --> 21:04.686
I don't want
my daughter involved.

21:04.698 --> 21:06.646
Should have thought about that

21:06.662 --> 21:07.706
before you handed
around her picture.

21:07.722 --> 21:09.730
Yeah, I should have thought
about a lot of things.

21:10.222 --> 21:11.702
If we don't use
your daughter's photo,

21:11.718 --> 21:14.658
we won't be able to prosecute
the man who had her picture.

21:14.674 --> 21:17.654
Oh, please. Come on, he's got
other photos in his collection.

21:17.666 --> 21:18.706
Can't you use one of them?

21:18.718 --> 21:20.722
Problem is, we can't ID
any of the kids.

21:22.654 --> 21:25.714
If I could ID them,
will you leave her out of it?

21:27.690 --> 21:32.678
There are some of my photos
on the same website as Ruby's.

21:32.694 --> 21:35.730
You take pornographic pictures
of children, including your own.

21:36.646 --> 21:38.666
They didn't know
about the cameras.

21:38.678 --> 21:40.698
They weren't being hurt, OK?

21:40.710 --> 21:42.686
I never thought they'd find out.

21:42.702 --> 21:45.702
I don't want Ruby to know
that there's photos of her

21:45.714 --> 21:47.650
circulating on the internet.

21:47.666 --> 21:49.642
If she knows
that I'm the one responsible,

21:49.658 --> 21:51.706
she's going to think that
I'm some kind of...

21:51.718 --> 21:54.726
What? A monster?

21:56.646 --> 21:59.726
I'm admitting that I took
illegal photos, alright?

22:00.638 --> 22:01.642
Isn't that enough?

22:01.658 --> 22:04.670
You'll still get a prosecution,
just without Ruby,

22:04.682 --> 22:05.718
and you'll have me as well.

22:05.734 --> 22:07.694
I think we'll stick with
what we've got.

22:07.710 --> 22:10.650
Thanks all the same.
I'm offering to plead guilty.

22:10.666 --> 22:13.642
Talk to the cops.
I don't trust cops.

22:14.646 --> 22:16.694
You want to save your daughter,

22:16.706 --> 22:19.646
you tell me everything you know.

22:19.662 --> 22:21.714
Everything. Who, what, why,
where, when, how.

22:21.730 --> 22:26.638
These people, they are dangerous.
Not my problem.

22:26.654 --> 22:28.642
Might be your daughter's,
but it's not mine.

22:28.654 --> 22:29.674
I can't.

22:29.690 --> 22:31.702
Right, fair enough.
Thanks for your time.

22:36.702 --> 22:39.694
Who'd you sell 'em to?
I can't tell you that.

22:39.710 --> 22:41.650
Then you're not much use,
are you?

22:41.666 --> 22:43.670
Who'd you sell the photographs to?
I need names.

22:43.686 --> 22:46.638
I didn't sell them directly.
Don't fuck me around!

22:46.654 --> 22:49.658
Either give me something I can use
or you're wasting my time.

22:49.674 --> 22:52.658
The man who acquitted me,
Judge Renmark.

22:52.674 --> 22:53.686
He's someone who received
the photos.

22:53.698 --> 22:55.686
And he's dead. No use. Who else?

22:55.702 --> 22:57.710
Alright, OK. There's another
guy, Keith Nelson.

22:57.726 --> 22:59.714
Yeah, he's in jail.
This is bullshit.

22:59.730 --> 23:01.718
You're giving me names of people
you know we can't touch.

23:01.730 --> 23:03.658
Forget it.

23:03.674 --> 23:08.670
If they know that I told you this,
they will kill me.

23:11.646 --> 23:16.654
There is a post office box.
Everything goes through there.

23:26.646 --> 23:29.658
Remind me why you let
Owen Mitchell quit the force?

23:29.674 --> 23:32.642
I'd like to say it's because he's
a smartarse, but the truth is

23:32.658 --> 23:33.710
he found a way to make a lot
more money.

23:33.726 --> 23:36.646
He is wasted at the DPP.
What have you got?

23:39.670 --> 23:41.678
Same as the others.

23:41.694 --> 23:44.678
Found it in a very interesting
post office box.

23:44.694 --> 23:47.654
Harvard Mark Solutions
is a business

23:47.670 --> 23:49.726
registered to one
Andrew Blakely.

23:50.642 --> 23:52.714
Drew.
He might not be running things.

23:52.726 --> 23:54.674
This just says he was involved.

23:54.690 --> 23:57.714
The USB and a bunch of disks
were in the box.

23:57.726 --> 23:59.686
They were sourced from everywhere,

23:59.702 --> 24:01.658
collated and distributed
from Russia.

24:01.674 --> 24:03.662
Well, how much material
do they all contain?

24:03.678 --> 24:05.706
Haven't counted exactly,
but thousands.

24:05.718 --> 24:07.722
Tens of thousands of images.

24:08.638 --> 24:10.658
Some comparatively innocent,
others...

24:11.658 --> 24:14.658
Well, torture would not be
an exaggeration.

24:14.670 --> 24:16.650
All children, wide range of ages.

24:16.666 --> 24:19.682
Until I started here, I had no idea
what sick puppies humans are.

24:19.694 --> 24:20.734
I'm with you.

24:21.650 --> 24:24.714
At least killers have the decency
to knock their victims off.

24:24.730 --> 24:28.674
So they're getting digital porn
via the post?

24:28.690 --> 24:30.678
This time, yes.
Found a mailing list?

24:30.694 --> 24:32.646
Still ploughing through
all the material,

24:32.658 --> 24:33.714
and we'll confirm who's in charge,

24:33.730 --> 24:36.638
but we can't assume it's Drew
off the back of this.

24:36.654 --> 24:37.690
What, you're thinking
Steven Blakely?

24:37.706 --> 24:40.702
Steve, Renmark, Nelson,
or maybe someone else entirely.

24:40.714 --> 24:42.650
Drew will know.

24:42.666 --> 24:44.682
Jack's personally escorting Drew
in from remand.

24:44.698 --> 24:46.706
I imagine he'll be very ready to
talk after that.

24:46.718 --> 24:49.674
Tell me about this.

24:49.690 --> 24:52.642
One of the places
Dad sourced the images.

24:52.658 --> 24:55.670
Mostly Eastern European.
Always got 'em sent by snail mail.

24:55.682 --> 24:57.666
It's harder to trace.

24:57.682 --> 24:59.662
Dad didn't know anything
about IT.

24:59.678 --> 25:01.710
All he knew from work was that
if you used the internet,

25:01.722 --> 25:03.658
you left a footprint.

25:03.674 --> 25:05.642
I used to deliver things for him

25:05.658 --> 25:07.642
while I was still at school,
for cash.

25:08.650 --> 25:10.090
No idea what was inside
the packages.

25:10.646 --> 25:15.646
I opened a package one day,
had a look.

25:16.730 --> 25:20.646
When he found out,
I thought he was going to kill me.

25:20.662 --> 25:23.702
But he just sat me down and
told me I was involved now.

25:23.718 --> 25:26.734
If he went down, so did I.
But this is your business.

25:27.646 --> 25:29.638
Dad used my address.

25:31.710 --> 25:33.702
I had to do what I was told.

25:37.654 --> 25:39.702
Keith Nelson. Was he one
of your father's clients?

25:39.714 --> 25:41.674
Yeah, he was one of them.

25:43.678 --> 25:44.726
I can give you a list.

25:45.642 --> 25:47.670
And what about Grenville Renmark,
the judge?

25:47.686 --> 25:49.710
We know someone was with him
when he died.

25:49.722 --> 25:52.646
We've got your DNA on record.

25:52.662 --> 25:54.710
Won't take us long
to make a match.

25:57.694 --> 26:00.694
Renmark wanted to take over
running the business.

26:00.710 --> 26:05.642
I didn't want to keep going.
He wouldn't listen to me.

26:05.658 --> 26:07.718
He wanted to show me
how in control he was,

26:07.734 --> 26:11.666
so he paid someone to set a bomb
in Janet King's car.

26:12.718 --> 26:14.734
Go on.
Well, I was furious.

26:15.650 --> 26:18.722
I confronted him, and he didn't
like that. He grabbed me.

26:19.638 --> 26:23.650
We were in this car park, up high.
There was no-one around.

26:23.666 --> 26:26.690
He was dragging me over the edge.
I tried to get away from him.

26:26.702 --> 26:30.722
He was strong. And then he fell.

26:31.638 --> 26:33.670
You didn't push him?
No, I... I didn't...

26:33.686 --> 26:37.658
He was trying to push me over.
So he fell?

26:37.670 --> 26:40.690
Yeah. Or jumped, I don't know.

26:40.706 --> 26:42.722
We had a hold of each other,
and then we didn't.

26:44.670 --> 26:46.650
I didn't even hear him land.

26:54.678 --> 26:58.698
Jack said if I cooperated
you'd go easier on me.

27:06.666 --> 27:11.674
Jack, you offered Steve's killer
a deal.

27:11.690 --> 27:14.674
Well, we don't need Nelson now.
Drew's given us the lot.

27:14.690 --> 27:17.642
What the bloody hell...
Hey, hey, hey, we've cracked it.

27:17.658 --> 27:19.666
You should be at the pub.
Oh...

27:19.682 --> 27:21.722
Hey, Steve was not one of us,
OK?

27:21.734 --> 27:23.666
I know it sticks in the guts,

27:23.682 --> 27:24.718
but we've just got
to accept that now.

27:24.734 --> 27:26.730
It's only Drew's word.
No, it's not.

27:27.478 --> 27:28.678
Steve had all the right links.

27:28.694 --> 27:30.714
He was of the same vintage
as these blokes,

27:30.730 --> 27:32.718
the same ranking,
the same power.

27:32.734 --> 27:36.686
You can't expect a kid like Drew
to tell these guys what to do.

27:36.702 --> 27:38.674
He'd shit his pants
at the sight of anyone

27:38.686 --> 27:40.007
who was anything like his father.

27:40.642 --> 27:42.706
Guys like Steve kept
this state safe.

27:42.718 --> 27:44.714
He made sure it ran smoothly.

27:44.726 --> 27:46.698
He kept the shitheads in line.

27:46.714 --> 27:48.698
He knew who to lean on
to get things happening.

27:48.710 --> 27:50.662
By blackmailing paedophiles?

27:50.678 --> 27:52.118
They're the scum of the earth,
right?

27:52.330 --> 27:54.650
Why wouldn't you lean on them?
Get them to shit themselves.

27:54.666 --> 27:56.698
Keep them in line. Get 'em
to do what you want them to do.

27:56.714 --> 27:58.690
Arrest who you want,
jail who you want.

27:58.706 --> 28:00.682
Look at it from a different
perspective.

28:00.694 --> 28:02.666
I'm not saying it's right,

28:02.682 --> 28:04.690
but the bottom line is this -
we've got him.

28:04.706 --> 28:06.730
And even without
all the theories,

28:07.646 --> 28:09.670
all the questions
have been answered.

28:20.710 --> 28:22.722
Got some news.

28:24.714 --> 28:27.718
News you need to tell me
outside of the office?

28:27.734 --> 28:31.734
Drew Blakely ran everything
under his father's guidance.

28:32.646 --> 28:33.726
Jack has a theory.

28:34.642 --> 28:37.642
Steve was blackmailing
the guys in the ring

28:37.654 --> 28:40.638
to get the results he wanted,

28:40.654 --> 28:43.678
in trials, government policy,
keeping scumbags in line,

28:43.694 --> 28:46.666
for the greater good
sort of thing.

28:46.678 --> 28:48.646
It was Steven.

28:51.670 --> 28:53.734
And what else?
What else did Drew say?

28:54.650 --> 28:55.930
Oh, looks like
he killed Renmark.

28:57.662 --> 29:00.654
After Renmark revealed
he'd organised the car bomb.

29:03.642 --> 29:04.722
Renmark?

29:08.658 --> 29:10.638
There was a connection.

29:23.646 --> 29:25.686
You know, I might not
have even been there.

29:25.702 --> 29:28.650
He didn't care if it
was just Ash and the kids.

29:29.718 --> 29:31.690
They can come home now.

29:34.702 --> 29:36.658
Yeah.

29:39.702 --> 29:41.686
Yes, they can.

29:49.730 --> 29:53.726
Hi, darling. Why aren't you
answering your phone?

29:54.602 --> 29:56.682
Look, I've got some good news
but I want to tell you,

29:56.698 --> 29:59.666
so can you call me, please?
Soon.

29:59.682 --> 30:05.638
Love to those beautiful children
and you. Can you call me?

30:10.646 --> 30:13.678
Would a drink be unseemly?
We are celebrating, after all.

30:13.694 --> 30:16.638
Well, I'm sure the sun
is over the yardarm.

30:16.650 --> 30:18.734
Oh, I'm sure it is. Somewhere.

30:21.714 --> 30:25.658
Ah, I'm not exactly match fit.
Could be entertaining.

30:25.674 --> 30:29.666
I doubt it.
Cheers.

30:29.678 --> 30:30.734
Cheers.

30:32.670 --> 30:36.682
Mmm. Ooh, so that's it,
end of story.

30:36.698 --> 30:38.726
Yes. My police guards
have been dismissed,

30:39.638 --> 30:41.706
and we can finally go home.

30:42.706 --> 30:45.674
The esteemed Steven Blakely ran

30:45.690 --> 30:48.638
a highly organised
child porn ring.

30:48.654 --> 30:50.674
Went undetected
by staying off the net,

30:50.690 --> 30:53.730
was assisted in this by his IT
genius son, who hated him.

30:54.646 --> 30:57.674
Members of the ring included
the judiciary, the public service,

30:57.690 --> 30:59.690
then who knows who else
from the top end of town?

30:59.702 --> 31:01.662
How thoroughly depressing.

31:01.678 --> 31:04.670
And who knows how many of Renmark's
judgements were tainted.

31:04.686 --> 31:07.646
Oh, could fuck us up for years.

31:07.662 --> 31:09.718
Hundreds of decisions
overturned.

31:09.730 --> 31:12.642
The State'll be in a mess,

31:12.658 --> 31:15.686
and God knows how many crims
just roaming around.

31:19.726 --> 31:21.730
You've been amazing
through all this.

31:22.646 --> 31:28.650
I don't know how you carried on.
I know I couldn't have.

31:30.718 --> 31:32.702
You're a fine human being.

31:35.642 --> 31:37.682
You really are.

31:39.642 --> 31:41.678
Don't you dare make me cry.

31:43.694 --> 31:46.678
Make us both cry,
we'll really be in trouble.

31:48.674 --> 31:52.686
Alright, that's it.
Back to the fray.

31:52.698 --> 31:54.646
All this wasn't the fray?

31:54.662 --> 31:57.706
Oh, Tracey has about 300 files
with your name on them.

31:57.718 --> 31:58.722
Thank you.

31:59.638 --> 32:02.158
And if you tell anyone I went soft
on you, I'll deny everything.

32:08.678 --> 32:10.726
Good news, thank the Lord.

32:11.329 --> 32:12.690
If you want to back up that truck,

32:12.706 --> 32:15.642
I'm ready to tackle
any files you have waiting.

32:15.658 --> 32:19.678
I don't believe anyone's ever
accused me

32:19.690 --> 32:21.658
of being a truck driver before.

32:31.694 --> 32:33.718
Ms Badir,
you've heard the summary,

32:33.734 --> 32:36.710
and you wish to plead guilty
to common assault, is that correct?

32:36.722 --> 32:38.710
Yes. Yes, Your Honour.

32:38.726 --> 32:41.638
Are you ready to proceed
with the plea now?

32:41.650 --> 32:42.678
I am, Your Honour.

32:45.642 --> 32:46.702
As an officer of the law,

32:46.718 --> 32:50.658
I should know better than anyone
else what constitutes assault.

32:50.674 --> 32:55.654
Despite this, I attacked
the victim, Mr Clarke,

32:55.670 --> 32:59.706
without any reason
or provocation.

32:59.722 --> 33:02.666
To say that I'm humiliated by
my own actions

33:02.682 --> 33:04.678
would be a great understatement.

33:04.690 --> 33:06.706
I am appalled by what I did.

33:06.718 --> 33:09.718
I'm not excusing my behaviour,

33:09.730 --> 33:12.726
but all I can say in mitigation,

33:13.642 --> 33:15.706
Your Honour, is that I operated

33:15.722 --> 33:18.686
at the time
under a misapprehension

33:18.702 --> 33:22.714
that the young girl in question
needed my protection.

33:22.730 --> 33:26.638
If the young girl
was in no way distressed,

33:26.654 --> 33:28.646
why did you think
she needed your help?

33:28.658 --> 33:29.682
Well, I...

33:32.686 --> 33:35.686
It's just a feeling I had,
Your Honour.

33:35.698 --> 33:38.714
A feeling? I see.

33:40.682 --> 33:43.686
As a solicitor,
I deeply regret my actions,

33:43.702 --> 33:46.670
and I can assure you there's no
need for specific deterrence,

33:46.682 --> 33:48.650
as I will not be doing this again.

33:48.666 --> 33:52.662
Usually on a charge such as this,
I would take into consideration

33:52.678 --> 33:54.662
the fact that you have
no prior convictions

33:54.674 --> 33:56.686
and order a Good Behaviour Bond.

33:56.702 --> 33:59.734
However, as an officer of the court,
you should have known better.

34:00.650 --> 34:02.710
Your conduct must be
of a higher standard.

34:02.726 --> 34:06.722
Therefore, I'm sentencing you
to a community based order

34:06.734 --> 34:09.641
for a period of six months,

34:09.658 --> 34:11.658
during which you shall be
required

34:11.674 --> 34:14.654
to perform 40 hours
of community work

34:14.666 --> 34:16.641
and attend upon a psychologist

34:16.654 --> 34:17.714
for no less than six months,

34:17.730 --> 34:19.681
that being the duration
of the order.

34:20.726 --> 34:23.726
If I was going to go down, I
should have taken Clarke with me,

34:24.641 --> 34:26.658
instead of grovelling like that
in front of him.

34:26.674 --> 34:28.730
That's the most sickening thing
I've ever done.

34:29.646 --> 34:31.658
My mouth was so dry
I couldn't even look at him.

34:31.674 --> 34:33.678
I bet he was smiling.
He wasn't smiling.

34:33.694 --> 34:35.686
The only thing that made me
keep my mouth shut

34:35.702 --> 34:37.694
was knowing he was going
to get convicted.

34:37.710 --> 34:39.714
We can't use
the Ruby Moreno photo.

34:39.726 --> 34:41.730
What? Why?

34:42.417 --> 34:44.697
Moreno gave us information
on the whole Blakely porn ring.

34:44.714 --> 34:47.666
Ruby's photo was the trade-off.
Clarke gets away with it?

34:47.681 --> 34:50.646
For now. He's on the cops' radar,
though. He'll fuck up again.

34:50.661 --> 34:52.503
And you guys didn't tell me
because you thought

34:52.641 --> 34:53.674
I needed protecting?

34:54.702 --> 34:57.666
Now I feel just a little bit
patronised.

34:57.682 --> 35:00.658
I'm sorry. It's just
that you were so nervous.

35:00.674 --> 35:02.154
Oh, with good reason,
as it turns out.

35:02.413 --> 35:04.694
You should let the Law Society
know about your conviction,

35:04.710 --> 35:06.662
rather than them finding out
through the system.

35:06.674 --> 35:07.670
Take the initiative.

35:07.686 --> 35:09.766
Oh, you can actually say
something useful. And legal.

35:14.658 --> 35:17.678
I wish I'd never laid eyes
on Timothy Clarke.

35:17.694 --> 35:20.642
How did you end up in the same
random car park as Clarke?

35:22.702 --> 35:25.682
He suggested you do
something dodgy, didn't he?

35:25.698 --> 35:29.646
Yes, I did. Found his address and
told her he was a very bad man.

35:29.662 --> 35:31.706
The dodginess was my instigation.
Uh, uh, don't protect him.

35:31.718 --> 35:32.706
I'm not.

35:37.674 --> 35:41.694
So, got any more juicy stories
for the tabloids?

35:41.710 --> 35:44.698
Look, Erin,
I'm really sorry about that.

35:44.714 --> 35:48.694
I don't want an apology.
You actually did me a favour.

35:48.710 --> 35:50.698
Proved to me you're not
my type at all.

35:50.710 --> 35:52.666
I could have lost my job.

35:59.694 --> 36:01.642
How'd you go?

36:02.650 --> 36:05.670
I got convicted and he walks.

36:05.682 --> 36:07.686
So much for justice.

36:11.698 --> 36:14.714
We could use someone like you
in the force.

36:14.726 --> 36:17.650
I'm not big on uniforms.

36:17.666 --> 36:19.682
Come straight in
at detective level.

36:19.698 --> 36:22.650
You know, you've got plenty
of experience in criminal law.

36:22.662 --> 36:24.023
That's got to count for something.

36:24.642 --> 36:25.694
Thanks.

36:25.706 --> 36:28.642
But I want to be a lawyer.

36:28.658 --> 36:32.662
I'm good at it, when I'm not
assaulting perpetrators.

36:32.674 --> 36:33.714
Yes. Yes, you are.

36:33.730 --> 36:36.662
And you know what else?
What?

36:36.678 --> 36:39.730
I'm proud that your first instinct
was to save someone in trouble.

36:40.646 --> 36:43.682
And it's what makes you
such a good lawyer.

37:23.666 --> 37:25.682
I believe
there's some good news.

37:25.694 --> 37:27.662
Yes, there is.

37:32.670 --> 37:34.674
Can I have a look?

37:37.646 --> 37:41.654
Drew seemed so, I don't know,
weak or something.

37:41.666 --> 37:42.714
But to kill a judge?

37:42.730 --> 37:45.730
Well, he hasn't admitted to
killing Renmark, not yet anyway.

37:46.642 --> 37:47.682
There's his father too.

37:47.694 --> 37:49.674
Blakely was a big, strong man.

37:49.690 --> 37:51.670
With enough motive,
you can do anything.

37:58.650 --> 38:00.658
Hang on a second.

38:03.658 --> 38:05.638
See this?

38:05.654 --> 38:08.650
You stab me in the eye with this
pen and you could kill me, Janet.

38:09.650 --> 38:11.650
Can you see the initials
on that pen?

38:11.662 --> 38:15.722
Mm. G and R, I think.

38:16.558 --> 38:18.678
Well, that'd be right,
wouldn't it? Granville Renmark?

38:18.694 --> 38:20.694
I just need to make a phone call.
Do you mind?

38:20.706 --> 38:21.710
Sure.

38:26.646 --> 38:29.674
Andy?
Hey, Janet.

38:29.686 --> 38:31.662
Hey, come over for a drink.

38:31.674 --> 38:32.718
Look, I was just wondering,

38:32.734 --> 38:34.690
that pen that was found
with Renmark's body.

38:34.702 --> 38:36.670
Was that ever DNA tested?

38:36.686 --> 38:39.690
What's the interest
in the fountain pen?

38:40.710 --> 38:42.706
Sounds like you're having a party.

38:42.722 --> 38:45.698
We cracked the code, didn't we?
Fat bastard, we got him.

38:45.710 --> 38:47.690
Yeah, Jack's shouting the drinks.

38:47.706 --> 38:51.706
Look, I might leave you to it.
Lina?

38:52.706 --> 38:54.666
Can I borrow your phone?
Yeah.

38:54.682 --> 38:56.718
Thanks.
Are you OK?

39:08.682 --> 39:10.650
You're joking, right?

39:10.666 --> 39:12.714
That pen belongs to Jack Rizzoli.
I've seen it.

39:12.730 --> 39:14.702
He talked about it
being a murder weapon.

39:14.718 --> 39:18.686
Do you remember that?
GR. Giacomo Rizzoli.

39:18.702 --> 39:20.710
And it puts him at the scene
of Renmark's death.

39:20.726 --> 39:22.714
Why would he not say
he was there with Renmark

39:22.726 --> 39:24.686
unless he's hiding something?

39:24.698 --> 39:25.734
Shit.

39:26.650 --> 39:29.654
So Rizzoli told Owen that
I was reporting on him for silk.

39:29.670 --> 39:31.670
Renmark was on the silk selection
committee.

39:31.686 --> 39:33.366
He led us in completely
the wrong direction

39:33.642 --> 39:34.678
for the Moreno defence.

39:34.694 --> 39:37.658
When we first dragged him in,
he was on about being an artist.

39:37.674 --> 39:39.698
Then his lawyer turned up,
told him to put a sock in it.

39:39.714 --> 39:42.666
If you want my opinion, that's
the line they'll run with.

39:42.682 --> 39:44.666
He pushed us to prosecute
Dianne Vasilich,

39:44.678 --> 39:45.702
before Blakely's body was found.

39:45.718 --> 39:48.666
He took me off the task force
in the middle of everything.

39:48.682 --> 39:50.883
I'm running the investigation
into the biggest shitstorm

39:51.369 --> 39:52.690
this department has seen
in years!

39:52.706 --> 39:55.694
I know. I tried to suggest somebody
else but they wouldn't budge.

39:55.710 --> 39:58.690
Don't worry, the task force
continues, just without you.

39:58.702 --> 40:00.678
And he gave Drew his alibi.

40:00.694 --> 40:03.698
Drew only confessed
about Renmark and the bomb

40:03.710 --> 40:04.870
after Jack had been with him.

40:06.654 --> 40:09.638
Maybe Renmark wasn't
behind the bomb.

40:09.650 --> 40:10.690
It was Jack.

40:10.706 --> 40:12.706
He tried to kill me
and my family...

40:14.646 --> 40:16.662
..when he thought I got too close
to the truth.

40:18.650 --> 40:20.690
Does he know that you were
coming here, meeting me?

40:20.706 --> 40:22.682
No, it's OK.
I thought I was meeting Lina.

40:22.698 --> 40:24.642
'Cause he could have people
anywhere.

40:24.654 --> 40:25.718
OK, you take the taxi.

40:25.734 --> 40:27.686
You head straight
to the safe house.

40:27.698 --> 40:29.650
You do not call anyone. No-one.

40:29.666 --> 40:31.638
I told Ash to come home.
I will call her.

40:31.654 --> 40:33.694
Don't tell her anything.
I won't worry her, I promise.

40:33.710 --> 40:35.682
We'll get some security guys
for you, OK?

40:35.698 --> 40:37.694
You stay there
until you hear from me.

41:20.666 --> 41:22.678
Andy, it's me.

41:22.694 --> 41:26.638
There are no security guards
here yet. What's happening?

41:27.666 --> 41:28.714
Can you call me?

41:37.678 --> 41:38.722
OK, you listen to me.

41:38.893 --> 41:40.694
I don't give a fuck
how short-staffed you are.

41:40.710 --> 41:42.682
I want security back
on that safe house now.

41:42.694 --> 41:43.734
Call me when it's done.

41:44.650 --> 41:46.682
I also need someone to run
a mobile number for me.

41:46.694 --> 41:49.638
0491 570 159.

41:49.654 --> 41:53.654
I want to know where that phone
was on Thursday the 4th.

41:56.646 --> 42:00.698
Come on, Andy. Come on.

42:00.710 --> 42:03.638
Oh, thank God.

42:03.650 --> 42:05.678
You know, I was just about...

42:07.678 --> 42:11.686
Jack.
Janet.

42:11.702 --> 42:14.698
I've cancelled the security guys.
You don't need them.

42:14.714 --> 42:16.682
Thought I'd give you
the VIP treatment.

42:16.694 --> 42:18.662
Drive you home myself.

42:18.678 --> 42:21.670
Ah, my car's still at
the police headquarters...

42:21.682 --> 42:23.658
I got it out. It's right here.

42:23.674 --> 42:26.654
Thought you'd like things to be
as normal as possible.

42:27.726 --> 42:30.670
That's very thoughtful of you.

42:32.670 --> 42:33.698
Look, it's late

42:33.714 --> 42:35.674
and I'm happy to drive myself home
in the morning...

42:35.690 --> 42:37.658
It's the least I can do.
I haven't packed.

42:37.674 --> 42:40.642
Everything's really unorganised.
Sort it out tomorrow.

42:42.682 --> 42:45.662
What you need now is a night
underneath your own roof. Come on.

43:46.670 --> 43:48.662
Leave it.

43:54.674 --> 43:56.662
I said fucking leave it!

44:22.674 --> 44:24.686
Don't be so fucking stupid!

45:06.658 --> 45:07.686
Get out.

45:07.702 --> 45:10.638
No-one's going to believe
I killed myself.

45:10.654 --> 45:13.678
I don't want to hurt you.
I just want to talk to you.

45:13.694 --> 45:17.674
Talk? Like you talked
to Renmark, and Blakely?

45:17.686 --> 45:20.662
I didn't kill Blakely.

45:20.678 --> 45:25.678
Drew did. He hated him.
Now get out of the car.

45:36.650 --> 45:37.710
Walk.

45:39.694 --> 45:41.642
Walk!

46:00.658 --> 46:03.666
Andy knows you ran the ring
with Steven.

46:03.678 --> 46:05.646
Steven?

46:06.666 --> 46:10.674
He had nothing to do with it.
It was Drew.

46:10.690 --> 46:13.642
I was watching it for months
before I realised it was him.

46:14.706 --> 46:17.650
You dropped your pen
when you killed Renmark.

46:22.650 --> 46:27.698
This one?
From the evidence room? Huh?

46:29.662 --> 46:30.862
Now you ready to listen to me?

46:33.654 --> 46:38.710
I wanted good people to be safe.
Just like you do.

46:40.698 --> 46:42.698
That's all I want.

46:42.714 --> 46:46.670
All those sickos,
they're not gonna stop.

46:46.686 --> 46:48.642
If they don't get
the stuff from Drew,

46:48.658 --> 46:51.670
they'll just get it off the net
or some other place.

46:51.686 --> 46:56.690
Right now, at this moment,
they'll do whatever I say.

46:56.706 --> 47:01.670
I have this power
over powerful people.

47:01.682 --> 47:02.722
The system works.

47:03.638 --> 47:05.662
This state hasn't been
this safe for years.

47:05.678 --> 47:09.666
All I need is you to keep quiet.

47:09.678 --> 47:11.642
Keep quiet?

47:14.722 --> 47:17.646
You tried to kill my children.

47:18.385 --> 47:19.706
They were never going
to get hurt.

47:19.718 --> 47:21.658
It was a fuckin' bomb.

47:21.674 --> 47:23.718
It was controlled!
Now listen to me.

47:23.734 --> 47:27.642
All the kids in those photos,
from Eastern Europe,

47:27.654 --> 47:29.694
they are impossible to identify.

47:29.706 --> 47:30.694
Impossible.

47:30.710 --> 47:33.686
I can't do anything, nothing
at all, to help those people.

47:33.702 --> 47:35.714
It's not just about
those children.

47:35.726 --> 47:38.638
It's about Ruby Moreno.

47:38.654 --> 47:40.666
It's every kid that Alex Moreno
took a photo of,

47:40.682 --> 47:42.658
it's every kid
in the Blakely beach house.

47:42.670 --> 47:43.694
They are all under your care.

47:43.710 --> 47:46.690
Those images give me
a way of controlling things,

47:46.702 --> 47:48.638
a way we'd lost.

47:48.650 --> 47:50.714
You are sacrificing children.

47:52.662 --> 47:53.694
I'll resign.

47:53.710 --> 47:58.694
OK? I'll resign. I'll walk away.
Yeah, I'll just walk away.

47:58.710 --> 48:01.710
You can prosecute all the guys
in that ring, all of 'em.

48:01.726 --> 48:03.706
And let me tell you,
there's a lot of them.

48:03.722 --> 48:05.702
But it'll shut down
without me and Drew.

48:05.714 --> 48:07.686
It will. It'll shut down.

48:10.698 --> 48:14.642
You just don't get it, do you?
You don't get it!

48:14.654 --> 48:15.730
If I go to prison,

48:16.646 --> 48:18.682
every case that I've worked on
in the last decade,

48:18.698 --> 48:20.178
all of them,
every single one of them,

48:20.642 --> 48:21.670
they will be overturned.

48:21.682 --> 48:22.718
They will be appealed.

48:22.734 --> 48:24.722
And that's a lot of offenders
back out there.

48:25.326 --> 48:27.686
You want to be part of putting
that scum back on the street?

48:27.702 --> 48:30.686
Listen, I'm not taking responsibility
for anything you've done.

48:30.702 --> 48:36.722
Janet, I just... need you
to get on board.

48:36.734 --> 48:38.670
Or what?

48:39.702 --> 48:41.654
Are you going to get rid of me?

48:43.650 --> 48:48.642
There's Novak, Moreno, Tony,
they all know things.

48:48.658 --> 48:50.706
Andy'll know I'm missing.
He'll have alerted people.

48:54.658 --> 48:59.682
Please. Please, Janet.

49:01.658 --> 49:02.858
You can help me convince them.

49:03.638 --> 49:04.718
I won't help you.

49:07.730 --> 49:11.714
If you want to keep me quiet,
you're gonna have to kill me.

49:18.666 --> 49:20.670
Please.

51:14.658 --> 51:17.690
So the cops have charged
everyone involved.

51:17.706 --> 51:22.646
You wanted all this sorted out.
Neat little ribbon.

51:22.662 --> 51:23.718
A second high-ranking
police officer dead

51:23.734 --> 51:25.702
was not exactly
what I had in mind.

51:25.718 --> 51:27.670
Yes, well a lot of things
have happened

51:27.686 --> 51:29.650
which are not exactly
what we had in mind.

51:29.666 --> 51:32.670
Tragic.
Yes, tragic.

51:32.686 --> 51:36.662
Jack was a fine man.
Not exactly the words I'd choose.

51:36.674 --> 51:38.678
A great loss for the public.

51:38.694 --> 51:40.694
Are you actually going
to do this?

51:40.710 --> 51:42.694
What'd be the point of doing
anything else?

51:42.710 --> 51:44.698
It'd destroy the public faith
in the force.

51:44.714 --> 51:47.706
Well, we wouldn't want
to destroy anyone's faith.

51:47.722 --> 51:50.722
I appreciate your support,
you and your department,

51:50.734 --> 51:52.670
at this difficult time.

51:52.686 --> 51:54.086
I know you worked closely
with Jack.

51:54.321 --> 51:55.682
It must be devastating
for you all.

51:55.694 --> 51:57.730
Yes, quite devastating.

51:58.642 --> 52:00.674
But you're to be congratulated.

52:00.690 --> 52:02.678
I believe that
without the tireless work

52:02.690 --> 52:04.678
of you and your departments,

52:04.694 --> 52:07.658
some of these perpetrators
might not have been apprehended.

52:07.674 --> 52:11.654
Well, we do what we can.
You're way too modest.

52:11.670 --> 52:14.646
Under your leadership,
the department is flourishing.

52:14.662 --> 52:16.662
Which brings me to
the purpose of this meeting.

52:16.674 --> 52:17.710
Ah, the purpose.

52:17.726 --> 52:21.710
In light of the achievements
of you and your staff,

52:21.726 --> 52:24.646
I'd like to increase
your funding.

52:24.662 --> 52:26.698
I'm thinking
an extra 10 million a year.

52:26.714 --> 52:29.678
I'm sure you'd be able
to put that to good use.

52:29.694 --> 52:32.642
In light of our achievements
with Blakely,

52:32.654 --> 52:34.702
and other related matters.

52:34.718 --> 52:38.662
Exactly.
I see.

52:38.678 --> 52:42.670
Well, if you're that pleased
with our achievements,

52:42.686 --> 52:45.658
perhaps you could stretch it
to an extra 20 million.

52:46.658 --> 52:50.642
I'm sure with a little shuffling
we could manage 20 million.

52:50.658 --> 52:52.734
We can find a way
to arrange that.

52:53.646 --> 52:55.702
Good. Then we're agreed.

52:55.714 --> 52:58.658
It appears we are.

53:02.730 --> 53:06.734
Giacomo, Jack Rizzoli,

53:07.650 --> 53:09.666
served his community
with distinction

53:09.678 --> 53:11.694
for more than 30 years.

53:11.710 --> 53:14.694
He joined the police officer
straight from school,

53:14.706 --> 53:17.650
intent on a life of public service.

53:18.662 --> 53:20.650
There was no doubt
in anyone's mind

53:20.666 --> 53:23.642
that he would move quickly
through the ranks.

53:23.654 --> 53:25.710
His intelligence, his courage,

53:25.726 --> 53:28.678
his support of his
fellow officers,

53:28.690 --> 53:30.666
his exemplary character,

53:30.682 --> 53:32.726
all these attributes
were apparent in Jack

53:33.642 --> 53:35.686
from very early in his career.

53:35.702 --> 53:39.638
He was a mentor
and friend to many.

53:39.654 --> 53:42.638
It would not be too much to say
that he was, indeed,

53:42.654 --> 53:45.690
an inspiration to all
who worked with him.

53:45.706 --> 53:48.706
What a bloody circus.
Should have brought a bucket.

53:48.722 --> 53:52.722
Although we mourn his loss today
as colleague and friend,

53:53.638 --> 53:55.638
we can take comfort in the fact

53:55.654 --> 53:57.654
that he leaves behind
a fine legacy,

53:57.670 --> 54:00.726
and a police force inspired
by his example.

54:05.690 --> 54:08.650
Thinking of expanding
the department.

54:08.666 --> 54:11.654
A dozen extra solicitors.
What do you think?

54:11.670 --> 54:16.702
Half a dozen crowns?
Think about it.

54:17.726 --> 54:22.698
Hymn number 345,
We Shall Sleep, But Not Forever.

54:22.714 --> 54:25.722
A right royal piss-up is required
after this charade.

54:26.638 --> 54:29.714
Not with this mob of arselickers.
You and me and Andy Campbell.

54:29.730 --> 54:32.698
Drink to forget.
It's on the department.

54:32.710 --> 54:35.638
We've come into a bit of money.

54:56.670 --> 54:59.722
The government throws a good bash
when they're rewriting history.

55:00.638 --> 55:02.646
Oh, it's happened before,
it'll happen again.

55:02.662 --> 55:05.690
At least this time all the bad guys
are dead or in jail,

55:05.702 --> 55:07.638
which serves the rest of us.

55:07.654 --> 55:10.666
For the greater good.

55:10.678 --> 55:12.662
There's another conspiracy.

55:12.678 --> 55:16.674
She'll go to the grave believing
she had the perfect son.

55:16.686 --> 55:18.646
Pub?

55:18.658 --> 55:20.690
Another time. I've got a date.

55:26.678 --> 55:28.722
Have fun at the pub.

55:30.730 --> 55:32.698
Shall we?

55:32.714 --> 55:35.650
They're not expecting us
back at work, are they?

55:35.666 --> 55:37.710
Probably.
Stop worrying about Tracey.

55:37.726 --> 55:40.698
We're drinking because
we earned it. And it's on Andy.

55:40.714 --> 55:42.722
Yeah!
Oh, I don't think so.

55:42.734 --> 55:44.678
Thanks, Andy.

56:43.584 --> 57:32.458
