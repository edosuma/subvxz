WEBVTT

01:51.361 --> 01:53.023
He's gone.

02:04.708 --> 02:06.074
Lyndon.

02:06.168 --> 02:08.000
Lyndon.

02:08.044 --> 02:09.752
Wake up, honey.

02:09.838 --> 02:12.421
We're about to land in Washington.

02:13.800 --> 02:14.881
Okay.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.383
Did you hear from Bobby?

02:23.435 --> 02:25.472
He'll be waiting on the tarmac.

02:26.313 --> 02:28.930
There will be reporters there, too.

02:29.024 --> 02:30.936
You'll be expected to make a statement,
something short.

02:31.026 --> 02:32.608
- Thank you.
- I wanna reach out to the leadership

02:32.694 --> 02:34.560
as soon as we hit the ground.

02:34.655 --> 02:37.238
I wanna talk to each and every one of them.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.649
You call Rose Kennedy?

02:39.743 --> 02:41.279
I did.

02:41.370 --> 02:45.114
My Lord, what that woman has been through.

02:46.333 --> 02:47.869
Your lipstick.

02:47.918 --> 02:49.625
- What?
- Fix your lipstick.

02:50.754 --> 02:51.744
Oh.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.256
How did John Connally's surgery go?

02:55.342 --> 02:57.959
Doctors are optimistic.

02:58.261 --> 02:59.251
Ah.

02:59.638 --> 03:01.550
Thank God for that.

03:04.309 --> 03:05.299
Jackie?

03:06.395 --> 03:08.432
She won't change her clothes.

03:11.149 --> 03:15.109
Says she wants them to see
what they have done to Jack.

03:15.654 --> 03:20.194
You see the way she stared at me
before I took the oath?

03:20.283 --> 03:24.527
- She's upset, honey.
- We're all upset, Bird!

03:28.125 --> 03:30.242
We're all upset.

03:33.797 --> 03:38.292
Walter, a televised address
to both houses of Congress

03:39.636 --> 03:42.629
as soon as it seems decent.

04:59.424 --> 05:02.963
Where were you just now, Mr. President?

05:04.763 --> 05:07.255
Accidental President.

05:07.349 --> 05:09.557
That's what they'll say.

05:13.104 --> 05:14.470
Well,

05:15.774 --> 05:19.233
we'll have to change that next November.

05:41.466 --> 05:44.925
<i>I keep having this dream.</i>

05:44.970 --> 05:49.305
<i>I'm back in the Hill Country in the old days,</i>

05:49.391 --> 05:51.758
<i>hiding down in the root cellar</i>

05:51.810 --> 05:56.145
<i>while a Comanche war party searches
through the house just over my head,</i>

05:57.774 --> 05:59.766
<i>hunting for me.</i>

06:01.486 --> 06:05.730
<i>It's so dark down there, like a grave.</i>

06:05.782 --> 06:09.275
The President of the United States!

06:10.954 --> 06:13.571
<i>For this terrible moment,</i>

06:13.623 --> 06:16.491
<i>I wonder if I'm dead already</i>

06:18.920 --> 06:21.253
<i>or buried alive.</i>

06:21.298 --> 06:23.255
Mr. President.

06:25.176 --> 06:29.671
<i>I piss myself like an idiot child
crouching in the dirt,</i>

06:30.932 --> 06:35.518
<i>knowing it's only a matter of time now
before they find the trapdoor,</i>

06:35.604 --> 06:37.561
<i>discover me,</i>

06:39.107 --> 06:43.647
<i>haul me, screaming, up into the light,</i>

06:44.946 --> 06:47.484
<i>where their knives gleam.</i>

07:07.636 --> 07:10.754
All I have,

07:10.847 --> 07:15.842
I would have given gladly
not to be standing here today.

07:17.395 --> 07:23.733
The greatest leader of our time
has been struck down

07:23.818 --> 07:27.357
by the foulest deed of our time.

07:29.032 --> 07:33.652
John F. Kennedy told his countrymen

07:33.703 --> 07:38.994
that our national work would not be finished
in the life of this administration,

07:40.210 --> 07:43.829
nor even perhaps in our own lifetime.

07:45.674 --> 07:48.166
"But," he said,

07:48.218 --> 07:51.006
"let us begin."

07:52.889 --> 07:58.305
Today, I'd say to all my fellow Americans,

07:58.979 --> 08:01.562
let us continue.

08:08.738 --> 08:14.609
We have talked long enough
in this country about civil rights.

08:15.537 --> 08:20.248
We have talked for 100 years or more.

08:21.084 --> 08:25.124
It is time now
to write the next chapter in the books of law.

08:27.215 --> 08:34.087
I urge you to enact
President Kennedy's civil rights bill into law,

08:34.139 --> 08:37.381
so that we can eliminate from this nation

08:37.433 --> 08:41.519
every trace of discrimination
that is based upon race or color.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.561
That's right!

09:17.307 --> 09:21.392
You hear what that Negro
comedian Dick Gregory said about me?

09:21.478 --> 09:26.940
"When Lyndon Johnson finished his speech,
20 million Negroes unpacked."

09:28.276 --> 09:30.142
That was a fine speech, Mr. President.

09:30.195 --> 09:33.688
Dear to my heart, but I know some people
are wondering, "Did he really mean it?"

09:33.782 --> 09:38.652
Well, you could tell that liberal crowd of yours
that I'm gonna out-Lincoln Lincoln.

09:38.703 --> 09:40.695
But you need to get behind me

09:40.789 --> 09:43.372
because you know
Dick Russell and the Dixiecrats

09:43.458 --> 09:46.997
are gonna fight me tooth and nail
on this civil rights stuff.

09:47.045 --> 09:49.207
Now, not too tight in the bunghole, Manny.

09:49.297 --> 09:51.459
And give me some extra room
in my pockets there

09:51.508 --> 09:53.750
for my stuff, my keys and my knife,

09:53.843 --> 09:55.755
and leave me some slack for my nut sack.

09:55.845 --> 09:57.632
<i>Walter!</i>

09:57.680 --> 09:59.842
Walter, you let me know
the minute Dick Russell gets here

09:59.933 --> 10:02.676
and get me Katharine Graham
from the <i>Post,</i> will you?

10:02.727 --> 10:05.310
But timing is critical here, Hubert,
you understand me?

10:05.355 --> 10:07.312
<i>With the election only 11 months away...</i>

10:07.357 --> 10:10.896
If the Republicans are foolish
enough to nominate Barry Goldwater,

10:10.985 --> 10:13.398
you'll beat him
with both hands tied behind your back.

10:13.488 --> 10:16.105
Well, Goldwater is tougher than you think.

10:16.199 --> 10:18.486
But first, I gotta win
the Democratic nomination.

10:18.535 --> 10:21.369
Holy crap. What happened here?

10:21.412 --> 10:24.246
You tell Lady Bird about this,
and she'll starve me for a month.

10:24.332 --> 10:26.369
- Senator Russell.
- Oh. Yep, yep.

10:26.459 --> 10:27.791
Give me one minute.

10:27.877 --> 10:29.709
George Wallace is a nobody.

10:29.796 --> 10:31.753
Well, it wasn't Wallace I'm thinking of.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.422
You don't have to worry about Bobby.

10:33.508 --> 10:37.343
Bobby Kennedy would just soon
cut my throat as smile at me.

10:37.387 --> 10:41.472
You know how strongly I feel
about this civil rights bill.

10:41.558 --> 10:43.049
<i>If there's anything I can do...</i>

10:43.143 --> 10:44.975
Yeah, yeah, I'll keep that in mind, Hubert.

10:45.061 --> 10:46.893
Mr. President.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.556
Senator Russell.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.983
Ah. Uncle Dick.

10:53.069 --> 10:55.686
Well, well, well.

10:58.408 --> 11:02.402
- Mr. President.
- Ah. Lyndon, Lyndon, please.

11:02.495 --> 11:05.454
No, sir. No, not anymore.

11:05.540 --> 11:07.122
Wouldn't be respectful.

11:07.208 --> 11:10.952
Well, in public, then,
but nothing else changes between us.

11:11.045 --> 11:16.632
Now, hell, I owe everything I have
to your good wisdom and generosity,

11:16.718 --> 11:18.880
and don't you think for a second
I'll ever forget it.

11:18.928 --> 11:22.262
Well, you did throw me
for a bit of a loop last night.

11:22.348 --> 11:25.841
A civil rights bill
with your election coming up?

11:25.935 --> 11:29.178
For 100 years, the Democratic Party's
had a lock on the South.

11:29.272 --> 11:30.979
It'd be a foolish thing to throw that away.

11:31.065 --> 11:34.103
Oh, hell, Dick,
you know I got to throw Humphrey

11:34.194 --> 11:37.187
and the rest of those liberals
a little bit of red meat now and again.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.897
- Yes, but...
- Sir, Dr. Martin Luther King is on three.

11:39.949 --> 11:42.236
Well, he can wait.

11:46.122 --> 11:49.957
So last night was
just election-year politics or not?

11:50.043 --> 11:51.955
Absolutely.

11:52.045 --> 11:55.459
But I need you
to hold the South for me, Uncle Dick.

11:55.548 --> 11:59.087
Party unity, it is gonna be critical.

11:59.135 --> 12:01.548
Well, we can talk more about it

12:01.638 --> 12:04.847
when Lady Bird and I have you
over for dinner on Thursday, as usual.

12:04.933 --> 12:07.892
Oh. There's no need for that now.

12:08.645 --> 12:11.638
Oh. Our Thursday dinners are sacred.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.644
- Well...
- Hey, why don't you bring your swimsuit

12:14.692 --> 12:18.060
and you could paddle your milk-white ass
around the White House pool before dinner?

12:19.906 --> 12:22.023
Congratulations, Mr. President.

12:22.116 --> 12:23.948
Thank you, Senator.

12:29.832 --> 12:32.119
What the hell was she thinking?

12:32.168 --> 12:34.034
Won't happen again, sir.

12:34.128 --> 12:35.994
J. Edgar Hoover on four.

12:36.089 --> 12:39.207
I mean no disrespect,
but take down that stuff over there.

12:42.804 --> 12:45.296
- Edgar.
- Mr. President.

12:45.348 --> 12:48.887
The FBI is here to assist in any way we can.

12:48.977 --> 12:52.516
Oh, hell, Edgar, you're more than
the head of the Bureau.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.346
You're my brother.

12:54.440 --> 12:57.854
Now, if the Bureau needs anything from me,
you just let me know.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.776
<i>Well, in light of
your announcement last night,</i>

12:59.862 --> 13:02.775
I think we should have a discussion
regarding Dr. King.

13:02.865 --> 13:06.074
I recently acquired certain information
which is deeply troubling.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.368
Uh... Edgar, Edgar, I hate to interrupt,

13:08.454 --> 13:10.662
- but they're pulling me six ways from Sunday.
- Mr. President!

13:10.707 --> 13:13.165
I'm interested in this,
and we'll talk soon, I promise.

13:13.209 --> 13:14.495
<i>If I could just...</i>

13:15.378 --> 13:17.461
Did King screw his sister or something?

13:17.547 --> 13:19.539
That man's obsessed.

13:19.632 --> 13:22.500
All right, Manny, let's just get this over with.

13:22.552 --> 13:23.668
What?

13:24.887 --> 13:26.423
What is it?

13:26.514 --> 13:28.426
Katharine Graham
of <i>The Washington Post</i> is on two.

13:28.516 --> 13:32.055
- What?
- And Dr. King is still on three.

13:32.145 --> 13:35.559
Look, I don't need to be reminded
of what I already know.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.765
God damn it, you know, you're fired.

13:37.859 --> 13:39.600
Go on, get the hell out of here.

13:39.694 --> 13:42.778
Walter, get me another secretary
who knows what she's doing.

13:42.864 --> 13:46.232
And one with a little meat on her bones,
for Christ's sake.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.613
Not another one of these scrawny,
old Washington biddies.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.531
Oh, God damn it, Manny.

13:50.580 --> 13:53.948
Don't you have anything that doesn't make me
look like a dago undertaker?

13:55.376 --> 13:59.245
I wanna thank you, Dr. King,
for your public expression of support.

13:59.339 --> 14:02.582
Well, we were all very heartened
by your speech last night, Mr. President.

14:02.675 --> 14:05.133
Well, it ain't gonna be easy.

14:05.219 --> 14:07.711
<i>- It's a difficult time.</i>
- Yes, it is.

14:07.764 --> 14:10.882
But, as you suggested,

14:10.933 --> 14:13.971
the greatest tribute
we can pay to President Kennedy

14:14.062 --> 14:17.851
is to enact his civil rights bill,
especially voting rights.

14:17.940 --> 14:21.559
Yeah, well, you're preaching
to the choir there, Reverend.

14:21.611 --> 14:24.570
Voting rights is the meat of the coconut,

14:24.614 --> 14:28.733
and we're gonna pass that bill, as is,
without changing a word.

14:28.785 --> 14:30.617
But, boy, I'm gonna have to have your help.

14:30.703 --> 14:33.036
Well, you know you have it, sir.

14:33.122 --> 14:35.535
Well, thank you, Martin. Thank you.

14:35.625 --> 14:37.833
And listen, why don't you call
next time you're up here

14:37.919 --> 14:39.751
and any suggestions you have,

14:39.796 --> 14:41.879
<i>- bring them in.</i>
- Well, actually...

14:48.888 --> 14:51.050
Just blowing smoke up my ass.

14:51.349 --> 14:54.808
He called for a civil rights bill
in front of Congress, Martin.

14:54.894 --> 14:57.056
Kennedy made promises, too, Stanley.

14:57.146 --> 14:59.729
- He just never delivered.
- He's no George Wallace.

14:59.816 --> 15:03.776
You sure? So deep in Russell's back pocket,
you'd think he was humping him.

15:03.945 --> 15:06.608
He passed the '57 Civil Rights Act.

15:06.656 --> 15:08.648
After he gutted it first.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.357
That bill was like soup

15:10.451 --> 15:13.285
made from the bones
of an emaciated chicken.

15:13.329 --> 15:16.367
Martin, listen,
he's a Southern politician.

15:16.457 --> 15:19.325
<i>He's spent his entire life
trying to be president.</i>

15:19.419 --> 15:21.081
<i>But he's there now.</i>

15:21.170 --> 15:23.958
<i>For the first time,
he can do whatever he wants.</i>

15:24.006 --> 15:26.419
That's the question, isn't it?

15:26.509 --> 15:28.876
What does Lyndon Johnson really want?

15:28.970 --> 15:33.965
Well, whatever it is, 11 months from now,
he has to run for reelection.

15:34.016 --> 15:37.134
Like Kennedy, he damn sure is
gonna need the Negro vote to win.

15:37.186 --> 15:38.677
Amen.

15:38.771 --> 15:41.354
LBJ wants our support.

15:43.443 --> 15:44.934
Okay.

15:46.988 --> 15:51.232
But this president is gonna have to
deliver a real civil rights bill.

15:51.325 --> 15:54.443
And we're gonna hold
his feet to the fire until he does.

15:54.537 --> 15:56.324
- Damn right.
- That's right.

15:56.372 --> 16:00.582
...<i>11 months
from now, he has to run for reelection.</i>

16:00.668 --> 16:03.877
<i>Like Kennedy, he damn sure is
gonna need the Negro vote to win.</i>

16:03.963 --> 16:05.204
<i>Amen.</i>

16:05.965 --> 16:07.627
Stanley Levison.

16:07.717 --> 16:10.255
Why is this so-called
"Reverend" Martin Luther King

16:10.344 --> 16:12.677
taking advice
from a well-known Communist agitator?

16:12.722 --> 16:14.634
That's a very good question, sir.

16:14.724 --> 16:16.181
Let's see who else King is meeting.

16:16.225 --> 16:18.182
I want all his travel covered from now on.

16:18.227 --> 16:19.638
- Get started.
- Yes, sir.

16:21.230 --> 16:24.940
I will leave the goddamn Democratic Party
before I turn it over

16:25.026 --> 16:27.393
to a bunch of Congolese savages.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.479
Now, hold on a second, Strom.

16:29.572 --> 16:33.407
This bill is just the thin edge of the wedge.

16:33.451 --> 16:36.910
You saw what King
and his bunch did in Birmingham.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.238
Why, integrated buses are just the beginning.

16:39.332 --> 16:42.746
Now we gotta shop with them,
eat with them, work with them.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.623
We have been oppressed and degraded
by black, slimy,

16:45.713 --> 16:48.672
- unbearably stinking niggers.
- That's enough of that kind of talk.

16:48.758 --> 16:50.215
That's exactly what they wanna hear,

16:50.259 --> 16:53.593
so they can dismiss us all
as a bunch of redneck goons.

17:02.605 --> 17:04.597
Thank you, Joles.

17:07.108 --> 17:09.817
We have to be very careful
how we handle this.

17:09.904 --> 17:12.146
The issue is not about race.

17:12.240 --> 17:16.483
It's about the gravest possible assault
on the United States Constitution,

17:16.577 --> 17:18.193
which we are fighting to defend.

17:18.287 --> 17:22.076
The president is actively gathering signatures

17:22.124 --> 17:25.413
for a discharge petition to get the bill
out of my committee in the House.

17:25.461 --> 17:27.417
And what do you expect him to do, Judge?

17:27.463 --> 17:29.955
He's got to at least look lively on civil rights.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.041
When the time comes,
he's gonna do the right thing.

17:32.134 --> 17:35.343
- He'll gut the bill?
- Yes. He knows who his friends are.

17:35.429 --> 17:37.421
But if he gets the bill out of my committee?

17:37.473 --> 17:40.511
It still has to go through the House,
then out of Jim's committee

17:40.601 --> 17:42.513
before it even gets to the Senate floor.

17:42.603 --> 17:45.391
And none of this
can get in the way of party unity.

17:45.481 --> 17:48.269
In this election,
we can have a lock on the Senate

17:48.317 --> 17:52.061
and a lock on the House, and we can
elect a Southern Democrat president.

17:52.154 --> 17:55.647
It's about time
the South rejoined the rest of the country.

17:58.160 --> 18:01.028
My friends, if we do our part,

18:01.122 --> 18:05.412
Lyndon is gonna know
who to thank on November 4th.

18:05.501 --> 18:08.209
And don't you worry about the president.

18:09.171 --> 18:11.333
I know how to handle him.

18:11.424 --> 18:14.041
<i>Well, the mainstream of American politics</i>

18:14.135 --> 18:17.594
<i>has carried you and me
down to the road to statism and socialism</i>

18:17.680 --> 18:20.263
<i>and the destruction
of the Constitution of the United States.</i>

18:20.349 --> 18:24.389
<i>And I am, for one, am already out
of the mainstream of American politics.</i>

18:25.229 --> 18:29.018
He sure gets people stirred up,
even in Milwaukee.

18:30.067 --> 18:34.107
When we get to Atlantic City,
I will be the Democratic nominee.

18:34.196 --> 18:36.779
But how damaged will you be?

18:36.866 --> 18:40.280
Be plenty strong enough
for Goldwater in November.

18:40.745 --> 18:44.864
What if Bobby smells blood
and decides to run at the last minute?

18:45.708 --> 18:49.418
That little shit doesn't have
his brother's balls.

18:49.503 --> 18:52.211
Still has his daddy's money.

18:53.049 --> 18:56.213
You might win the nomination,
but if the party splits...

18:56.260 --> 18:57.876
Oh, come on now, Dick.

19:00.222 --> 19:04.182
All Wallace has to beat you with
is this damn civil rights bill,

19:04.226 --> 19:07.970
and I don't, for the life of me,
understand why you are giving him this issue.

19:08.064 --> 19:11.273
At this point,
I'm more worried about the liberals

19:11.359 --> 19:13.851
than I am about the Dixiecrats.

19:13.903 --> 19:16.361
We got to give them something
this time, Dick.

19:16.405 --> 19:18.692
- You know that.
- You got to look like

19:18.741 --> 19:19.902
you're giving them something.

19:19.992 --> 19:24.202
All I'm saying is, don't work so hard
to get this bill out of the House.

19:24.246 --> 19:25.987
I do what I can.

19:26.082 --> 19:29.575
Now, Lyndon, you're gonna talk
poor Uncle Dick to death,

19:29.669 --> 19:31.581
and here Zephyr's made his favorite dinner,

19:31.671 --> 19:33.708
- and it's getting cold.
- Saved by the belle.

19:33.756 --> 19:35.873
Bird, you look beautiful as always.

19:35.925 --> 19:38.918
And you are a terrible liar as always.

19:38.969 --> 19:41.086
Politician's curse.

19:42.431 --> 19:45.219
So,
do you like being the First Lady?

19:45.267 --> 19:47.008
Well, it's been an adjustment.

19:47.103 --> 19:49.436
- I can imagine.
- But I am enjoying it.

19:53.693 --> 19:57.983
"Any jackass can kick a barn down,

19:58.072 --> 20:01.031
"but it takes a carpenter to build one."

20:02.284 --> 20:04.116
You remember who told me that?

20:04.203 --> 20:06.160
Sam Rayburn?

20:06.247 --> 20:09.786
Sam Rayburn, Speaker of the House.

20:09.875 --> 20:12.788
Oh, I could've kissed his bald head.

20:13.546 --> 20:14.878
Thank you.

20:16.132 --> 20:21.503
God knows I've been kissing his ass
since the day I moved to Washington,

20:21.595 --> 20:24.212
trying to get him to take notice of me.

20:25.641 --> 20:27.177
You know what Mr. Sam wanted?

20:27.268 --> 20:30.011
- His greatest regret?
- No, sir.

20:30.104 --> 20:32.471
A towheaded boy to take fishing.

20:34.483 --> 20:38.318
Well, I heard that,
and I did my damnedest to be that boy.

20:39.488 --> 20:41.354
Suck-up? Yeah.

20:41.449 --> 20:43.065
Brown-noser? Sure.

20:43.159 --> 20:45.492
Kiss-ass? You bet. I heard them all.

20:45.578 --> 20:46.614
Fuck you!

20:48.914 --> 20:51.372
Everybody wants power, Walter.

20:52.209 --> 20:53.620
Everybody.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.911
And if they say they don't, they're lying.

20:56.005 --> 20:57.541
Yes, sir.

20:57.631 --> 21:03.548
But everybody thinks it ought to be given out,
free of charge, like Mardi Gras beads.

21:04.930 --> 21:09.049
Especially to them because, of course,
they're gonna do good with it.

21:10.853 --> 21:12.560
Nothing comes free.

21:14.106 --> 21:15.187
Nothing.

21:16.859 --> 21:18.976
Not even good.

21:22.323 --> 21:23.689
Especially not good.

21:27.912 --> 21:33.783
When the carpenter picks up his saw,
if wood could talk,

21:35.127 --> 21:36.993
it would scream.

21:39.507 --> 21:43.342
You cannot cut voting rights
out of the civil rights bill!

21:43.385 --> 21:47.095
Well, you can't pass
the civil rights bill with it, not this year.

21:47.181 --> 21:50.925
You told Dr. King you wanted this bill
passed without one word changed.

21:51.018 --> 21:53.761
You don't go
and sell a horse by talking about it

21:53.854 --> 21:55.846
being blind in one eye and got the heaves.

21:55.898 --> 21:58.060
They're gonna think
you're just gutting the bill, sir.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.516
Bullshit!

21:59.568 --> 22:01.560
It's still a damn good bill.

22:01.654 --> 22:05.193
Public housing, access,
school desegregation...

22:05.241 --> 22:06.231
Don't you tell me

22:06.325 --> 22:08.362
- that ain't nothing, God damn it!
- The liberal wing of the party

22:08.410 --> 22:10.572
- will think you've betrayed them.
- Well, those are your people.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.620
- It's your job to bring them around.
- My job?

22:12.706 --> 22:15.790
Hell, yes. You're the great white hope
of liberals everywhere.

22:15.876 --> 22:17.663
Well, if I'm anything like what you say,

22:17.753 --> 22:19.995
it's because people know
I stand by my principles.

22:20.089 --> 22:21.580
"Principles"? Shit.

22:21.674 --> 22:24.758
This ain't about principles, it's about votes!

22:25.761 --> 22:28.048
You know, that's the problem
with you goddamn liberals.

22:28.097 --> 22:30.180
You don't know how to fight.

22:30.266 --> 22:32.724
- Mr. President...
- You say you're the leader of the liberal wing

22:32.768 --> 22:34.350
of the Democratic Party?

22:34.436 --> 22:36.849
- Then show me some goddamn leadership!
- Look out!

22:36.939 --> 22:38.601
- I got no brakes!
- Look out!

22:38.732 --> 22:40.098
- No brakes! Hold on!
- Jeez!

22:40.234 --> 22:41.395
Hold on!

22:44.613 --> 22:46.400
What in...

22:46.448 --> 22:49.156
My... What?

22:49.243 --> 22:51.735
I thought I was a goner.

22:51.787 --> 22:53.699
- This is watertight.
- Well, it's an amphibious car.

22:53.789 --> 22:57.203
- It's a car and a boat.
- I have never seen such a thing.

22:58.836 --> 23:02.000
I wish I had a photograph of your face. Whoo!

23:02.089 --> 23:03.921
- I've never.
- Oh.

23:05.593 --> 23:09.212
Do you wanna know what the ugliest
sound in the world is, Hubert?

23:10.306 --> 23:13.390
It's the tick-tick-tick of a clock.

23:15.644 --> 23:19.103
All the men in my family die young.

23:19.815 --> 23:22.398
I nearly died of that heart attack 10 years ago.

23:24.069 --> 23:26.732
- A terrible time.
- Yeah.

23:26.822 --> 23:29.155
And I ain't got much time left.

23:30.951 --> 23:35.070
You and me, we got till
the convention in August,

23:35.164 --> 23:37.406
while the people
are still grieving Kennedy's death,

23:37.499 --> 23:39.411
to get this bill passed.

23:39.501 --> 23:43.541
Now, if we don't act now, this opportunity
to do something about civil rights

23:43.631 --> 23:46.499
will just disappear forever.

23:48.510 --> 23:50.593
- Now, are you in or are you out?
- Well, that...

23:50.679 --> 23:53.342
Can you get the bill out
of the House Rules Committee?

23:53.432 --> 23:54.843
Leave Judge Smith to me.

23:54.934 --> 23:56.721
- And voting rights.
- Next year.

23:56.810 --> 23:58.472
- No...
- No, no, you have my word.

23:58.520 --> 24:02.230
Gonna be a very, very
difficult sell, Mr. President.

24:02.316 --> 24:04.774
Oh. I know. I know.

24:04.860 --> 24:08.149
That's why I want you
to be the floor manager of this bill.

24:08.197 --> 24:09.938
Floor manager?

24:10.699 --> 24:14.067
- I assumed that Majority Leader Mansfield...
- No, no!

24:14.161 --> 24:16.995
Mike is a good man,

24:17.039 --> 24:19.452
but, boy, I need someone more personable.

24:19.541 --> 24:21.749
And people like you, Hubert.

24:21.835 --> 24:23.701
Hell, even Dick Russell likes you.

24:23.796 --> 24:26.083
- Well, I wouldn't go that far.
- No, he does!

24:26.173 --> 24:27.880
He does.

24:30.761 --> 24:35.051
You know I'm under a lot of pressure
to announce my running mate for the election.

24:38.060 --> 24:40.768
Now, you show me

24:40.854 --> 24:44.313
that you got the guts
to push this thing through,

24:44.400 --> 24:48.314
and you make yourself
one very real candidate

24:48.404 --> 24:53.650
to become my Vice President
of the United States

24:54.994 --> 24:56.735
of America.

24:59.415 --> 25:02.032
A step away from the White House.

25:03.961 --> 25:05.873
And as we've seen,

25:07.506 --> 25:10.123
anything can happen from there.

25:28.944 --> 25:32.608
There's a barn owl out there
in the live oaks hunting mice.

25:35.784 --> 25:37.571
Is Hubert on board?

25:38.162 --> 25:39.778
Yeah.

26:10.235 --> 26:14.650
One heart attack in a lifetime is plenty,
thank you very much.

26:15.324 --> 26:16.781
Why do I put up with you?

26:16.825 --> 26:19.238
Because you would be lost without me.

26:22.247 --> 26:23.783
King won't be so easy.

26:25.626 --> 26:28.084
He won't trust me now,
and I can't say I blame him.

26:28.378 --> 26:30.085
He doesn't know you yet.

26:31.757 --> 26:35.797
If I keep King's support,
I risk losing Uncle Dick's.

26:36.345 --> 26:38.337
I may have, in any case.

26:39.973 --> 26:42.886
I always thought it would take
a Southern president

26:42.976 --> 26:45.343
to drag the South out of the past.

26:47.481 --> 26:50.349
Shit, they're not gonna thank me for it.

26:52.945 --> 26:55.938
You promised this country
a civil rights bill, Mr. President.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.902
And the voting rights component is critical.

26:58.992 --> 27:01.780
Absolutely critical, and we're gonna fix that.

27:02.287 --> 27:03.869
Just not in this bill.

27:04.331 --> 27:06.197
Right now, we're gonna take care

27:06.250 --> 27:08.993
of segregation
in public accommodations first.

27:09.044 --> 27:11.377
I got it. I'll get that, Manny. Thank you.

27:13.882 --> 27:17.717
You know every year, my cook,
Zephyr Wright...

27:17.761 --> 27:18.751
Oh.

27:18.887 --> 27:21.379
Best damn chicken-fried steak
you ever put in your mouth.

27:22.891 --> 27:26.885
Well, every year,
she and her husband drive my Packard

27:26.937 --> 27:29.475
from Washington back down
to the ranch for me.

27:30.107 --> 27:31.143
Well...

27:32.234 --> 27:36.695
Now, Zephyr, she can't use
any restrooms on those highways

27:36.738 --> 27:38.479
'cause they're all whites only.

27:39.241 --> 27:44.032
She got to squat in a field
by the side of the road to pee like a dog.

27:45.164 --> 27:48.202
Now, that's just not right,
and, by God, we're gonna fix that.

27:49.334 --> 27:52.918
Well, nothing in this country will ever change
until Negroes can vote.

27:53.881 --> 27:56.214
The next bill will be voting rights.

27:57.217 --> 27:59.834
After President Kennedy's election,

28:00.596 --> 28:02.588
Eisenhower had publicly declared

28:02.639 --> 28:05.302
that his party had taken
the Negro vote for granted.

28:06.185 --> 28:09.144
I would hate to see
the Democratic Party make the same mistake.

28:09.771 --> 28:13.890
If you think Barry Goldwater's
a legitimate heir to Abraham Lincoln,

28:14.610 --> 28:16.067
you should vote for him.

28:19.448 --> 28:23.192
You know, civil rights isn't the only thing
I'm interested in, Dr. King.

28:24.453 --> 28:28.538
We got people in this country
living in unbelievable poverty.

28:30.292 --> 28:31.908
I know.

28:31.960 --> 28:34.077
I grew up like that in the Hill Country.

28:36.882 --> 28:39.465
Picking cotton on my hands and knees,

28:39.509 --> 28:42.627
harnessed like a mule to a road plow,

28:42.679 --> 28:45.012
living off the bitter charity of my neighbors.

28:45.807 --> 28:47.514
But we're gonna change all that.

28:50.437 --> 28:52.895
We're gonna declare a war on poverty.

28:53.482 --> 28:55.144
A war on poverty?

28:55.192 --> 28:56.433
That's right.

28:56.485 --> 28:58.977
Now, I got all kinds
of federal programs in mind

28:59.071 --> 29:02.655
on health, education, literacy, jobs,
you name it.

29:02.741 --> 29:05.529
We're gonna change this country
top to bottom.

29:06.411 --> 29:07.993
That sounds extraordinary.

29:08.163 --> 29:09.654
There you go.

29:09.748 --> 29:13.492
And I would very enthusiastically support
legislation to that effect.

29:14.419 --> 29:15.955
But right now,

29:16.213 --> 29:19.251
I need to be able to go back to my people
and tell them

29:19.341 --> 29:22.175
that this president is committed
to civil rights,

29:22.844 --> 29:25.552
and that this bill, even without voting rights,

29:25.639 --> 29:28.803
will still be a strong bill
with no further changes.

29:29.977 --> 29:32.185
If I can't do that, I'll lose their faith.

29:33.355 --> 29:35.347
And in their despair, I...

29:38.277 --> 29:39.893
I don't know what'll happen.

29:41.280 --> 29:42.987
Is that a threat?

29:45.200 --> 29:47.908
I don't want riots any more than you do.

29:48.203 --> 29:49.865
But,

29:50.372 --> 29:53.285
in order to avoid that type of situation,

29:54.084 --> 29:57.623
I need to be able to deliver meaningful reform.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.542
Okay.

30:05.971 --> 30:07.303
Okay.

30:07.389 --> 30:09.005
Now here's what I need.

30:09.308 --> 30:12.096
The bill is stuck
in Judge Smith's Rules Committee,

30:12.185 --> 30:16.020
and I need at least eight votes... Walter!
To pry it out.

30:16.565 --> 30:19.057
Five Republicans and three Democrats.

30:19.151 --> 30:21.234
Walter! Oh, good. All right, here.

30:21.403 --> 30:22.564
Now, you get your people

30:23.488 --> 30:26.322
in each one of these districts here,
your ministers,

30:26.408 --> 30:29.196
your clergy, your union guys,
and what have you,

30:29.745 --> 30:33.238
to lobby these House members
to release that bill.

30:34.333 --> 30:37.872
And lobbying is just like
propositioning women, you know?

30:40.589 --> 30:42.046
I knew this fellow once.

30:42.132 --> 30:44.670
Ooh. He was a real ladies' man.

30:44.760 --> 30:47.468
He got more pussy than you ever saw.

30:48.305 --> 30:51.719
And I said to him, "What is your secret?"

30:51.767 --> 30:55.101
And he said, "Well, I go into a bar,

30:55.187 --> 30:58.931
"and I ask each woman
if she'd like to fool around."

30:59.775 --> 31:02.813
I said, "Boy, you must've got slapped a lot."

31:03.445 --> 31:05.482
He said, "Oh, hell yeah.

31:05.781 --> 31:08.615
"But I also got me a lot of yeses."

31:11.161 --> 31:13.198
Well, now,

31:14.581 --> 31:17.824
we only need eight yeses

31:18.377 --> 31:21.211
to get that bill
out of Judge Smith's committee.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.132
All right.

31:27.636 --> 31:29.002
All right.

31:30.097 --> 31:31.963
He said he'd get it out of committee

31:32.057 --> 31:33.514
and, by God, he did.

31:33.600 --> 31:34.807
Hallelujah.

31:34.851 --> 31:37.468
And all it cost us
was the voting rights section.

31:37.813 --> 31:40.897
The point is
we can work with this president.

31:40.982 --> 31:44.475
Now he's asking for our further assistance
in lobbying Congress.

31:45.278 --> 31:46.644
What do we have to lose?

31:46.738 --> 31:49.321
Do we have to endorse his candidacy as well?

31:49.408 --> 31:52.321
You still plan on voting Republican
this election, Bob?

31:53.537 --> 31:55.995
You know, Goldwater came out
against civil rights,

31:56.081 --> 31:58.289
purely on constitutional grounds, of course.

31:58.333 --> 32:00.620
Yes, personally Goldwater deplores racism.

32:01.586 --> 32:06.047
I just think asking for my vote
while denying me the right to vote is bullshit.

32:06.842 --> 32:09.334
The bill still gives us a lot.

32:09.678 --> 32:11.135
Unless he gives that away, too.

32:11.179 --> 32:13.671
I have his word
there will be no more compromises.

32:13.974 --> 32:15.590
His word? Are you serious?

32:15.684 --> 32:17.721
I cannot support a bill without voting rights.

32:17.811 --> 32:19.018
I'm not asking you to.

32:19.062 --> 32:21.805
I'm asking you to not work against it.

32:22.357 --> 32:26.647
The president is planning new legislation
that will bring a huge federal intervention

32:26.695 --> 32:29.938
to poverty, hunger, and jobs.

32:31.283 --> 32:32.990
Think what that will do for our people.

32:33.034 --> 32:34.775
- Forty acres and a mule.
- That's right.

32:34.870 --> 32:36.202
What if he's serious?

32:37.998 --> 32:39.079
Okay.

32:39.958 --> 32:42.041
We will not campaign against the bill,

32:42.085 --> 32:44.372
but we're not gonna sit on our hands either.

32:44.421 --> 32:47.664
What does the visionary Bob Moses propose?

32:47.716 --> 32:48.797
Freedom Summer.

32:50.051 --> 32:54.546
We are going to flood the state of Mississippi
with hundreds of student volunteers

32:54.598 --> 32:56.806
- to educate and register Negro voters.
- You crazy.

32:57.184 --> 33:00.393
- Mississippi?
- Not just Negro volunteers.

33:00.479 --> 33:01.560
White students, too.

33:01.646 --> 33:04.639
If just one of your white volunteers gets hurt,

33:04.733 --> 33:07.100
- you will do irreparable damage to the cause.
- That's right.

33:07.194 --> 33:11.188
Whereas if one of our Negro volunteers
gets hurt, who gives a fuck?

33:11.239 --> 33:12.730
There may be trouble,

33:13.241 --> 33:16.075
but if it takes some white kid
getting smacked around

33:16.161 --> 33:19.245
to shed a little light
on the darkness that is Mississippi,

33:19.331 --> 33:21.823
- then why not?
- Because people will die in Mississippi!

33:21.917 --> 33:24.125
- Roy, people are dying in Mississippi.
- Exactly. Exactly.

33:24.211 --> 33:27.545
- We're not asking...
- All right, all right, calm down.

33:28.298 --> 33:31.632
Nobody in here gonna do anything
they can't get behind.

33:31.718 --> 33:34.961
But we should respond
to the elimination of voting rights,

33:35.055 --> 33:37.593
and Freedom Summer
is the perfect way to do that.

33:37.682 --> 33:39.674
At the same time, Roy, you are right.

33:39.768 --> 33:42.055
The bill still does give us a lot.

33:43.522 --> 33:46.606
No one in this room
has your legislative experience.

33:47.275 --> 33:51.440
So clearly, you and the NAACP
should lead our lobbying efforts in D.C.

33:51.863 --> 33:52.853
Mmm.

33:54.157 --> 33:55.273
All right?

33:56.535 --> 33:57.651
Yes, okay.

34:03.625 --> 34:04.786
Gentlemen.

34:17.138 --> 34:18.424
Lord have mercy.

34:18.473 --> 34:20.931
One of these days,
Stokely and Wilkins gonna kill each other

34:20.976 --> 34:22.262
right there in the middle of the room.

34:22.811 --> 34:26.429
<i>In that case, we should sell tickets,
so I can stop giving speeches.</i>

34:28.692 --> 34:30.058
I know that's right.

34:30.150 --> 34:31.483
First thing tomorrow,

34:31.945 --> 34:36.063
let's reach out and get our membership
mobilized on this new campaign.

34:36.157 --> 34:37.364
Yeah.

34:37.449 --> 34:38.782
You need anything else?

34:39.661 --> 34:40.650
I'm okay.

34:40.745 --> 34:41.826
Good night, then.

34:59.848 --> 35:01.714
Give me a minute.

35:17.324 --> 35:18.781
Whoo!

35:18.867 --> 35:21.280
The sex-mad preacher.

35:21.870 --> 35:24.908
His hypocrisy is disgusting.
The man is a flagrant adulterer.

35:25.915 --> 35:27.372
Oh, my.

35:27.709 --> 35:31.168
A Southern preacher who fucks his choir.
Who ever heard of that?

35:34.007 --> 35:35.168
Oh, Edgar,

35:35.216 --> 35:37.173
if you arrested every politician

35:37.218 --> 35:39.551
and every preacher
who ever strayed from the marital bed,

35:39.638 --> 35:41.971
wouldn't be nobody in politics or the pulpit.

35:42.057 --> 35:44.674
His moral turpitude
is just the tip of the iceberg.

35:44.726 --> 35:47.844
- Why, his Communist connections...
- Edgar,

35:47.896 --> 35:51.264
far be it from me
to tell you how to do your job.

35:51.858 --> 35:53.850
So keep an eye on him, sure,

35:53.902 --> 35:58.738
but the House is about to vote
on my civil rights bill.

35:59.783 --> 36:01.524
And this

36:01.910 --> 36:03.367
is not helpful.

36:04.746 --> 36:06.738
- You understand me?
- Yes, sir.

36:08.291 --> 36:10.203
<i>As part of Freedom Summer,</i>

36:10.251 --> 36:12.743
<i>the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee, or SNCC,</i>

36:12.837 --> 36:16.421
<i>is recruiting and training black and white
college students from the North</i>

36:16.466 --> 36:19.709
<i>and bussing them into Mississippi
to register black voters.</i>

36:19.761 --> 36:23.254
<i>Police have confronted the activists,
leading to violent clashes.</i>

36:23.348 --> 36:25.340
<i>For two weeks, we've been training</i>

36:25.433 --> 36:28.141
<i>to join other Freedom Summer organizers
in Mississippi.</i>

36:28.228 --> 36:31.642
But I cannot emphasize enough to you
the dangers you will face.

36:32.107 --> 36:34.269
The federal government will not protect you,

36:34.359 --> 36:37.693
and the Mississippi government
will do everything it can to stop you.

36:38.071 --> 36:39.778
If at any time you wish to quit,

36:40.323 --> 36:42.815
you should do so, including now.

36:48.456 --> 36:50.914
All right. Let's get started.

36:52.627 --> 36:53.913
<i>Get on board</i>

36:53.962 --> 36:55.954
<i>Children, children, get on board</i>

36:56.005 --> 36:58.418
<i>Children, children, get on board</i>

36:58.466 --> 36:59.798
<i>Children, children</i>

36:59.843 --> 37:01.584
<i>Let's fight for freedom now</i>

37:01.636 --> 37:02.968
<i>Get on board</i>

37:03.012 --> 37:04.969
<i>Children, children, get on board</i>

37:05.056 --> 37:07.218
<i>Children, children, get on board</i>

37:10.186 --> 37:13.020
We will now call
the House of Representatives to order

37:13.481 --> 37:16.474
to consider House Bill 736,

37:16.985 --> 37:19.773
the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

37:21.114 --> 37:23.401
- <i>Mr. Speaker.</i>
- Can you hear that?

37:23.491 --> 37:27.326
<i>This bill is nothing less
than an assault on the Constitution</i>

37:27.370 --> 37:28.827
<i>by the federal government.</i>

37:30.623 --> 37:32.489
<i>Who are we</i>

37:32.542 --> 37:37.037
to tell the owner of a cafe
who he can hire or who he can serve?

37:38.923 --> 37:42.837
Who are we to tell a state

37:42.886 --> 37:45.970
that they may not pass segregation laws?

37:49.768 --> 37:51.725
As a conservative Republican,

37:52.187 --> 37:56.852
I believe that state authority
should not be needlessly usurped.

37:57.650 --> 37:59.016
Hear, hear.

37:59.068 --> 38:02.232
But I also believe
that the Constitution doesn't say

38:02.322 --> 38:05.781
that whites alone shall have our basic rights.

38:07.994 --> 38:09.485
Didn't see that coming.

38:09.704 --> 38:12.947
McCulloch is just playing
to the peanut gallery.

38:14.125 --> 38:15.536
Well...

38:15.835 --> 38:17.326
Are you, Lyndon?

38:17.879 --> 38:20.838
Is this just still so much red meat
for Humphrey and his gang?

38:22.175 --> 38:25.088
People aren't gonna stand
for Jim Crow anymore, Uncle Dick.

38:25.178 --> 38:28.046
I'm not saying
the Negro hasn't been put upon.

38:28.097 --> 38:30.555
He has been put upon most disgracefully.

38:31.017 --> 38:33.976
But you can't rush these things.
Look at the mess in Mississippi

38:34.062 --> 38:38.022
with all those agitators going down there,
getting in people's business.

38:38.066 --> 38:39.898
Folks are gonna get hurt.

38:39.943 --> 38:41.900
And whose fault would that be?

38:43.112 --> 38:44.398
<i>Mr. Speaker,</i>

38:45.240 --> 38:47.607
I would like to introduce an amendment

38:47.700 --> 38:51.410
that would exempt local businesses
in public accommodations.

38:53.540 --> 38:58.581
For instance, if you were a podiatrist
and had your office in a hotel.

38:58.628 --> 38:59.664
Come on!

39:00.004 --> 39:03.213
If I were cutting corns, I would wanna know

39:03.258 --> 39:06.547
whose feet I was gonna have to
be monkeying around with.

39:06.678 --> 39:09.136
Boo!

39:09.222 --> 39:10.838
Unbelievable.

39:10.932 --> 39:14.846
I would want to know
whether they smelled good or bad.

39:14.936 --> 39:16.552
God's honest truth.

39:18.773 --> 39:23.017
Podiatrists, like other minorities,
got rights, too.

39:23.111 --> 39:24.773
- That's nonsense!
- Yes, sir!

39:25.446 --> 39:27.688
To force them to work

39:27.782 --> 39:33.653
violates the 13th Amendment's prohibition
against slavery or involuntary servitude.

39:33.746 --> 39:36.159
You know,
if that's the best the judge has to offer,

39:36.249 --> 39:38.741
he should've lost his chairmanship
a long time ago.

39:38.793 --> 39:40.625
- Lyndon.
<i>- Mr. Speaker.</i>

39:40.712 --> 39:43.830
I, for one, am fed up with amendments

39:43.923 --> 39:46.916
that suddenly or blatantly
defeat the purpose of this bill.

39:49.804 --> 39:52.672
And to my esteemed colleague, Judge Smith,

39:53.474 --> 39:57.388
if you're going to trim
the stinky, smelly white corns...

39:59.772 --> 40:02.856
...you're gonna have to do the same thing
to the black ones.

40:03.067 --> 40:05.400
That's telling him.

40:05.862 --> 40:07.694
My goodness, man.

40:07.989 --> 40:09.901
Call for a vote, for God's sake.

40:10.074 --> 40:12.066
McCORMACK:
<i>With no more amendments to be offered,</i>

40:12.160 --> 40:16.905
<i>the Speaker calls for a final vote
on House Bill 736.</i>

40:17.624 --> 40:19.707
- Abbitt.
- Nay.

40:20.043 --> 40:21.909
Mr. Abbitt votes nay.

40:22.003 --> 40:24.086
- Abele.
- Yea.

40:24.422 --> 40:26.254
<i>Mr. Abele votes yea.</i>

40:26.341 --> 40:27.832
- Adair.
- Yea.

40:28.301 --> 40:29.963
<i>- Albert.
- Nay.</i>

40:30.011 --> 40:32.048
<i>Mr. Andrews from Alabama.</i>

40:32.138 --> 40:34.425
<i>- Nay.
- Mr. Andrews votes nay.</i>

40:34.515 --> 40:36.006
<i>Mr. Andrews from North Dakota.</i>

40:36.059 --> 40:38.517
<i>- Yea.
- Mr. Andrews votes yea.</i>

40:45.860 --> 40:48.352
Two-hundred and ninety votes for

40:49.072 --> 40:51.314
and 130 votes against.

40:52.825 --> 40:56.034
The bill passes and will now go to the Senate.

40:56.788 --> 40:58.620
We got it, Walter. Thank you.

41:05.588 --> 41:09.172
General Burnside thought
he'd crush Lee at Fredericksburg.

41:09.509 --> 41:12.047
His overconfidence cost him his army.

41:12.887 --> 41:16.631
And only three years later,
Lee surrendered at Appomattox.

41:19.560 --> 41:22.098
Nobody's surrendering, Mr. President.

41:24.857 --> 41:26.769
Thank you, Matthew. Most kind.

41:30.697 --> 41:31.687
Mmm.

41:33.366 --> 41:34.698
<i>In St. Augustine, Florida,</i>

41:34.742 --> 41:38.907
<i>Negro demonstrators were attacked today
by an estimated 500 angry whites</i>

41:38.955 --> 41:41.072
<i>when they broke through police lines.</i>

41:41.165 --> 41:43.908
<i>The conflict began
when 200 Negro demonstrators,</i>

41:44.002 --> 41:46.244
<i>led by Andrew Young
and other civil rights leaders...</i>

41:46.337 --> 41:49.250
"Trust LBJ. He's one of us."

41:49.924 --> 41:53.668
Is this the first time a civil rights bill
made it through the House?

41:53.970 --> 41:58.055
So the bill goes to the Senate.
All right? So what?

41:58.766 --> 42:02.055
How many civil rights bills
have you buried in the last 10 years?

42:02.103 --> 42:03.685
One-hundred and twenty-one.

42:03.771 --> 42:05.808
That graveyard of yours
got room for one more?

42:05.898 --> 42:07.890
I'm digging a hole as we speak.

42:07.942 --> 42:09.274
Well, all right, then.

42:09.360 --> 42:12.148
If he does get it out of committee, what then?

42:12.864 --> 42:15.277
Then we filibuster it to death.

42:15.658 --> 42:17.820
We stick together, we'll be fine.

42:17.910 --> 42:21.995
Public opinion's already against this bill,
especially with those riots going on.

42:22.749 --> 42:24.331
Time is on our side.

42:27.086 --> 42:28.327
Thank you, gentlemen.

42:29.964 --> 42:34.425
<i>And I see no need why we ought to sit idly by</i>

42:34.469 --> 42:37.837
<i>and see a bill pass in the American Senate
called "a civil rights bill"</i>

42:37.930 --> 42:40.968
<i>that will destroy individual liberty
and freedom in this country.</i>

42:42.143 --> 42:46.808
Wallace is running at 90%
with whites in eastern Maryland.

42:46.898 --> 42:50.107
If he wins that primary,
the Senate will never pass the bill.

42:51.152 --> 42:54.316
Wallace would be dead in the water
without these goddamn riots.

42:54.363 --> 42:56.070
He is deliberately provocative.

42:56.157 --> 42:58.194
King is supposed to control his people.

42:58.534 --> 43:01.402
I put my entire political career
at risk for the Negroes,

43:01.496 --> 43:02.577
and this is the thanks I get?

43:02.663 --> 43:04.199
- Put more money into Maryland.
- Yeah,

43:04.290 --> 43:05.826
beef up my schedule there.

43:05.875 --> 43:08.583
Now, what's your plan
to get our bill out of Eastland's committee?

43:08.669 --> 43:09.910
Discharge petition.

43:10.004 --> 43:12.337
Oh, shit. Why, you don't have the votes.

43:12.423 --> 43:14.756
No, but we're very close.

43:14.842 --> 43:16.959
Close? "Close" don't make shit.

43:17.011 --> 43:19.128
You don't have the goddamn votes.

43:19.180 --> 43:20.887
Fine, what's your idea?

43:20.973 --> 43:24.091
What? I can't hear a goddamn thing
you're saying, Humphrey.

43:24.685 --> 43:25.766
Come on over here.

43:27.355 --> 43:29.938
I said, what's your idea?

43:30.024 --> 43:34.359
Well, right now
it's all about the rules of the Senate.

43:35.113 --> 43:39.357
And Dick Russell's been studying them
since he was sucking on his mama's titty.

43:40.409 --> 43:45.029
Boy, I've seen him make a fool of you liberals
with some arcane rule of order

43:45.123 --> 43:48.036
more times than I can remember.

43:52.171 --> 43:53.457
Hold on.

43:55.508 --> 43:57.374
Ah! Son of a...

44:02.890 --> 44:04.381
You know what?

44:04.809 --> 44:09.179
There is a way that we can
completely bypass Eastland's committee

44:09.564 --> 44:11.430
without a discharge petition.

44:13.860 --> 44:15.647
And with a little luck,

44:15.736 --> 44:18.069
Russell won't even see it coming.

44:21.492 --> 44:22.903
He did what?

44:22.994 --> 44:25.953
<i>I think the president just
put over the bill out of committee.</i>

44:26.038 --> 44:27.279
All right.

44:27.623 --> 44:29.740
All right, keep Jim calm.

44:30.459 --> 44:32.075
I'll handle this.

44:37.425 --> 44:39.542
What do you think it is,
why it tastes a little different?

44:39.594 --> 44:42.962
Well, it's the temperature she cooked...
Everything all right, Uncle Dick?

44:43.472 --> 44:45.088
Just peachy.

44:48.519 --> 44:50.226
Would you like some more gravy?

44:50.813 --> 44:53.146
Oh, Lady Bird, it was delicious,
but I just couldn't possibly.

44:53.232 --> 44:55.394
- No, thank you.
- Hey, what about me?

44:55.776 --> 44:57.267
Aren't you gonna offer me any more gravy?

44:57.361 --> 44:59.774
Well, honey, I'd like to, but I can't.

45:00.114 --> 45:01.821
Bird's got me on a diet.

45:02.116 --> 45:05.780
Got Zephyr there in the kitchen
weighing my plates for every meal.

45:05.953 --> 45:07.615
It's ridiculous.

45:07.705 --> 45:11.164
Your wife just doesn't want you
to get too big for your britches.

45:12.084 --> 45:14.667
An entirely understandable concern.

45:20.259 --> 45:23.798
I think I'll see
how Zephyr's coming with that cobbler.

45:35.900 --> 45:39.814
I just heard how you snuck that bill
through Jim's committee

45:39.862 --> 45:42.696
with some bogus procedural point of order.

45:45.493 --> 45:49.203
A perfectly legal maneuver, Uncle Dick.
Just like you taught me.

45:49.288 --> 45:52.406
I also taught you something
about party loyalty.

45:52.500 --> 45:54.492
Well, the party's changing.

45:55.419 --> 45:59.754
This younger generation's not gonna
fall on their sword for segregation.

45:59.840 --> 46:04.255
You think every Southerner is
gonna start dancing to your tune? Hmm?

46:04.553 --> 46:06.385
Wallace almost won Maryland.

46:06.472 --> 46:07.508
But he didn't.

46:07.598 --> 46:11.137
Another riot and he will.
And there will be more riots.

46:11.185 --> 46:14.019
We're gonna filibuster this bill.
It will never pass.

46:14.063 --> 46:15.804
Are you so sure about that?

46:15.856 --> 46:17.392
I know what you're thinking.

46:17.942 --> 46:20.935
You're thinking
you're gonna cut a deal with Senator Dirksen.

46:21.028 --> 46:22.940
You filibuster, what choice do you leave me?

46:23.030 --> 46:26.523
A Democratic president
ignoring his own party

46:26.617 --> 46:29.701
and making a deal
with the Senate Minority Leader. Shameful!

46:30.079 --> 46:32.617
Now, don't you get
all high and mighty with me.

46:33.791 --> 46:35.373
You have been cutting deals

46:35.459 --> 46:37.542
with those conservative Republicans
for years,

46:37.586 --> 46:39.669
but now I can't cross the aisle?

46:39.714 --> 46:40.875
Shit.

46:49.265 --> 46:50.847
We don't have to fight, Dick.

46:57.023 --> 46:58.309
Yes, we do.

47:04.947 --> 47:06.734
I'm coming for you, Dick.

47:09.410 --> 47:13.404
Now, I love you more than my own daddy.

47:17.043 --> 47:18.909
But if you get in my way...

47:20.504 --> 47:21.915
I'll crush you.

47:23.966 --> 47:25.502
<i>I regret that the president</i>

47:25.593 --> 47:29.928
<i>has embraced the radical program
of the left-wing groups</i>

47:30.014 --> 47:33.428
<i>that is erroneously called
"the civil rights bill".</i>

47:33.851 --> 47:37.265
<i>It is still a vicious assault on the Constitution.</i>

47:37.897 --> 47:43.438
<i>And we in the Senate intend to fight
with our boots on to the last ditch.</i>

47:44.070 --> 47:47.734
<i>Beginning today, we will filibuster this bill.</i>

47:48.574 --> 47:50.486
<i>Let the real war begin.</i>

47:51.660 --> 47:54.118
This ain't about the Constitution.

47:55.831 --> 47:59.290
It's about those who got more
wanting to hang on to what they got

47:59.377 --> 48:01.460
at the expense of those who got nothing.

48:02.129 --> 48:03.620
- And feel good about it.
- Yeah.

48:03.714 --> 48:07.879
But the way he frames it,
draping himself in the Stars and Stripes,

48:07.968 --> 48:09.425
it's compelling.

48:09.470 --> 48:12.634
I mean, what are you fighting for, darling,
in your heart?

48:12.681 --> 48:14.889
That's what the people need to hear.

48:16.727 --> 48:19.970
Look at that. Look at that.
Look at the size of his ears.

48:20.147 --> 48:21.854
You get that?

48:25.152 --> 48:26.142
Whoo-hoo!

48:28.322 --> 48:31.190
Well, listen, I just wanna thank you all
for coming up here

48:31.283 --> 48:33.491
and sharing some time with me.

48:33.577 --> 48:38.117
I wanted to just respond
to what Senator Russell...

48:38.165 --> 48:39.281
His decision,

48:40.459 --> 48:43.668
unfortunate decision on filibustering this bill.

48:45.631 --> 48:49.124
It reminds me that when I got out of college...

48:49.969 --> 48:53.178
Now, the only job that I could get

48:54.640 --> 48:58.429
was teaching first grade at this

48:59.019 --> 49:02.262
beat-up, old elementary school
in Cotulla, Texas.

49:03.065 --> 49:08.777
It was just a dusty, old border town
in the middle of nowhere.

49:10.531 --> 49:14.491
Full of Mexican immigrants
who didn't have a pot to piss in.

49:16.787 --> 49:19.746
But, God, did I love those kids of mine.

49:22.334 --> 49:24.496
They'd show up hungry every morning

49:24.545 --> 49:26.832
'cause most of them hadn't had any breakfast.

49:28.174 --> 49:31.588
But they were so on fire to learn.

49:33.929 --> 49:35.545
It just made you feel good.

49:37.892 --> 49:41.306
But there'd come a day

49:42.354 --> 49:47.224
for each and every one of them
when I would see the light in their eyes die.

49:51.238 --> 49:54.276
'Cause they had discovered
that the world hated them

49:56.285 --> 49:58.447
just 'cause of the color of their skin.

50:04.376 --> 50:08.370
Well, some folks tell me just to go slow.

50:09.590 --> 50:12.253
They say the political risk is too high.

50:13.135 --> 50:15.422
And to that, I say, well,

50:15.638 --> 50:20.053
if a president can't do what he knows is right,

50:20.434 --> 50:22.391
then what's the presidency for?

50:27.191 --> 50:30.605
Senator Dirksen's so-called amendments

50:30.694 --> 50:34.278
are like putting a Band-Aid on a cancer.

50:34.782 --> 50:36.944
I have a real amendment to offer.

50:37.701 --> 50:42.116
This map shows the current concentration
of the Negro race in America.

50:43.249 --> 50:48.620
I propose we resettle Southern Negroes
all over the country

50:48.671 --> 50:53.757
until racial proportions are equalized
among the 50 states.

50:54.093 --> 50:59.009
I favor inflicting on New York and other cities

50:59.723 --> 51:04.093
the same conditions
that will be inflicted by this bill

51:04.144 --> 51:06.807
on the innocent people of Georgia.

51:16.615 --> 51:19.403
Is the president caving in?

51:19.493 --> 51:22.782
I'd ask him myself,
but he's no longer returning my calls.

51:22.830 --> 51:24.571
Absolutely not.

51:24.790 --> 51:29.080
My people have made every painful sacrifice
that's been asked of them,

51:29.378 --> 51:30.835
and the bill's still stuck.

51:31.046 --> 51:32.662
Martin, I'm as frustrated as you are,

51:32.715 --> 51:36.254
but lining up votes to break the filibuster's
a complicated process.

51:36.343 --> 51:38.335
Dirksen's amendments will gut the bill.

51:38.637 --> 51:41.425
Dirksen needs to look tough to his people.

51:41.515 --> 51:43.677
The time for posturing is over.

51:44.768 --> 51:46.100
It's time to act.

51:47.313 --> 51:49.475
I've put all my credibility on the line

51:49.523 --> 51:52.857
telling our young people
that this president can be trusted,

51:52.943 --> 51:54.559
but they want results.

51:55.195 --> 51:57.312
They're down in Mississippi right now

51:57.615 --> 51:59.106
putting their lives at risk,

51:59.199 --> 52:02.818
registering Negroes
for a vote they still don't have.

52:02.870 --> 52:04.702
I want a good bill, too, Martin,

52:04.747 --> 52:08.457
but you can't give people
blood tests for loyalty every 15 minutes.

52:08.542 --> 52:10.625
The president will handle Everett Dirksen.

52:10.711 --> 52:13.044
If this is what it takes to move the bill,

52:13.130 --> 52:16.339
I will start a public fast to the death.

52:17.051 --> 52:19.088
God, Martin, that's not necessary.

52:19.178 --> 52:21.090
What choice do I have?

52:23.557 --> 52:25.219
Right this way, Senator Dirksen.

52:26.310 --> 52:29.803
Everett, what's this bullshit
about how I treat my dog?

52:30.314 --> 52:33.227
- I'm sorry?
- My dog, Little Beagle Johnson.

52:33.275 --> 52:36.564
Why are you being such a shitheel
with the press about me pulling on his ears?

52:37.196 --> 52:39.813
Little son of a bitch loves
to have his ears pulled.

52:39.907 --> 52:43.696
Hell, I thought you were running
the Senate Republicans, not the ASPCA.

52:43.744 --> 52:45.280
Mr. President, I was just kidding

52:45.371 --> 52:47.328
- with the press about that.
- Well, don't.

52:47.414 --> 52:49.576
I'm a hell of a lot better
than you are with dogs.

52:49.625 --> 52:50.741
Dogs and people.

52:53.420 --> 52:54.911
I was hoping we could talk about...

52:55.005 --> 52:57.713
About appointing William Macomber
as ambassador, I know.

52:57.758 --> 52:59.966
- Well, yes, that among...
- Get this shot. Get this shot here.

53:00.511 --> 53:01.592
There we go.

53:01.679 --> 53:04.092
No, no, sit on over there.
It's more comfortable.

53:04.181 --> 53:05.262
That among other things...

53:05.307 --> 53:09.221
Well, we'll talk about all them things
in just a minute.

53:11.105 --> 53:14.439
Now, look here, Everett,
we gotta get this civil rights bill passed.

53:14.483 --> 53:16.645
- Yeah.
- The longer this filibuster goes,

53:16.735 --> 53:18.317
the stronger Russell gets,

53:18.404 --> 53:20.771
and the angrier
those Negroes on the street are.

53:21.990 --> 53:24.277
Now, how many votes are we gonna get
from your people?

53:24.368 --> 53:27.327
Well, that's what I wanted to talk to you about,
Mr. President.

53:27.413 --> 53:30.281
- There are 40 amendments I'm proposing.
- Forty?

53:30.457 --> 53:33.666
Well, my constituents
have a number of concerns.

53:33.752 --> 53:36.870
Now, let's not bullshit
an old bullshitter here, Everett.

53:36.964 --> 53:38.921
Let's just cut to the chase, shall we?

53:39.258 --> 53:43.548
Well, I think we have to strike
equal employment altogether.

53:44.179 --> 53:45.169
Mmm.

53:45.347 --> 53:49.091
I could probably get my troops
to accept public accommodations.

53:49.768 --> 53:54.934
But with, say, a year of voluntary compliance
before it becomes law.

53:56.775 --> 53:57.856
Nope.

53:58.277 --> 53:59.939
- No?
- No.

54:00.487 --> 54:01.694
No?

54:02.656 --> 54:04.488
There an echo in here?

54:05.284 --> 54:08.994
The Southern filibuster cannot be defeated
without substantial changes.

54:09.413 --> 54:11.154
But if you're willing to compromise,

54:11.248 --> 54:16.494
I think that I could deliver the necessary
25 Republican votes for cloture.

54:18.380 --> 54:19.916
No can do, Everett.

54:21.175 --> 54:24.794
Now, look here,
either your people vote for this bill,

54:25.262 --> 54:29.472
or you vote with the segregationists
and the country goes up in flames.

54:29.683 --> 54:32.300
Now, we're making history here, Everett.

54:32.853 --> 54:37.598
And you have to decide
how you want history to remember you.

54:38.192 --> 54:39.854
As a great man,

54:40.527 --> 54:43.520
a man who changed
the course of this country,

54:44.990 --> 54:48.404
or somebody who just likes
to hear himself talk.

54:50.245 --> 54:53.784
Congress is not alone
in contributing problems to the presidency.

54:53.874 --> 54:57.538
<i>Mr. Johnson has inherited
an armed clash in South Vietnam.</i>

54:58.003 --> 55:01.872
<i>President Johnson must decide
whether to continue it in its present form,</i>

55:01.965 --> 55:04.548
<i>to enlarge it, or seek a negotiated settlement.</i>

55:04.635 --> 55:08.254
Our pilot the Communists shot down
over Laos, he's alive?

55:08.347 --> 55:09.428
As far as we know.

55:09.515 --> 55:12.223
Well, hell, everything we can do
to get him back home, Robert.

55:12.267 --> 55:14.884
We'll talk more about this business in Tonkin.

55:14.937 --> 55:17.896
- Yes, sir.
- And, Walter, anything that McNamara needs,

55:17.981 --> 55:19.517
- you make sure he gets it.
- Yes, sir.

55:19.566 --> 55:21.273
- Is Humphrey still around?
- Hey, Daddy.

55:21.360 --> 55:24.273
Hey, now, don't just run off.
Come give me a hug.

55:24.363 --> 55:25.729
All right.

55:28.116 --> 55:29.323
- Grae.
- Mr. President.

55:29.409 --> 55:30.570
Boy, oh, boy, look at you.

55:31.870 --> 55:33.077
You're getting tall.

55:33.121 --> 55:34.828
- No, I'm wearing heels.
- Are you?

55:36.792 --> 55:37.782
Uh...

55:37.918 --> 55:39.955
Well, how you doing in school, Luci?

55:40.045 --> 55:41.377
Good, good.

55:42.339 --> 55:44.296
- That's good.
- Yeah.

55:45.592 --> 55:48.255
- Sir, Senator Humphrey's here.
- All right.

55:48.303 --> 55:50.716
- That's all right. Bye, Daddy.
- Bye.

55:51.390 --> 55:54.599
The justice says Bob Moses
of the Freedom Summer project

55:54.643 --> 55:56.760
has asked again for federal protection.

55:57.145 --> 55:59.432
Things are getting pretty violent
in Mississippi.

55:59.481 --> 56:02.269
The federal government
is not getting involved in this.

56:02.359 --> 56:04.567
Now, you make damn sure
that the governor down there

56:04.611 --> 56:07.354
understands that we expect him
to put a lid on his people.

56:08.282 --> 56:09.773
Is Khrushchev still in Egypt?

56:09.867 --> 56:12.325
Yes, sir, and the Soviets
had their first nuclear test

56:12.411 --> 56:14.277
at their new site in Eastern Kazakh.

56:14.913 --> 56:16.279
All right, talk to me, Hubert.

56:16.331 --> 56:18.368
Well, the good news is
we've got a deal with Dirksen.

56:19.835 --> 56:20.825
And what's the bad news?

56:21.587 --> 56:23.624
We're two votes short.

56:26.550 --> 56:28.462
Bill!

56:28.552 --> 56:31.920
I was just thinking about you.
Go on, take a ride with me.

56:31.972 --> 56:34.931
It's all right, boys.
I think I'm safe with Senator Fulbright.

56:34.975 --> 56:36.511
I'll see you up on three.

56:36.602 --> 56:38.343
Boy, oh, boy, look at you.

56:38.437 --> 56:40.645
- How you feeling?
- Fine, fine.

56:40.689 --> 56:42.772
Hey, listen, I need to talk to you
about something.

56:42.816 --> 56:45.103
Uh-huh. Nice cufflinks, Mr. President.

56:45.152 --> 56:46.688
Oh, you like these?

56:47.154 --> 56:48.395
- Do you?
- I do.

56:48.488 --> 56:49.979
Well, then they are yours.

56:50.073 --> 56:52.986
No, no, that's really not necessary.

56:53.035 --> 56:55.243
Well, I'd do anything for you, Bill.

56:55.621 --> 56:58.864
Hey, you know that good old boy
you put down for the federal bench?

56:59.374 --> 57:01.991
Boy, that's a pretty tough sell
for Humphrey's crowd,

57:02.044 --> 57:04.661
but if you were to support the civil rights bill,

57:04.755 --> 57:06.496
they'll just grin and bear it.

57:06.548 --> 57:10.337
Well, Mr. President,
I'm not sure my constituents would approve.

57:10.385 --> 57:11.876
Well, I understand that,

57:11.970 --> 57:15.338
but maybe you don't have to fight
quite as hard as you might otherwise.

57:15.724 --> 57:16.840
I don't think...

57:16.892 --> 57:18.599
Or maybe when the vote comes up,

57:18.685 --> 57:21.598
you happen to be overseas
visiting our troops.

57:22.064 --> 57:24.306
I'm sure Elizabeth would love Europe.

57:26.360 --> 57:28.898
You know she would. Like my wife.

57:29.696 --> 57:31.312
Here, lookie here.

57:31.698 --> 57:34.941
This is the seal of the presidency
of the United States.

57:35.035 --> 57:37.243
There's only two cufflinks like this
in the entire world...

57:38.413 --> 57:40.200
...and you now own them both.

57:40.415 --> 57:42.532
I want you to wear them in good health, Bill.

57:43.043 --> 57:44.875
And think about what I said, huh?

57:44.920 --> 57:48.084
You look good, Bill.
I bet you dropped a few pounds, huh?

57:49.049 --> 57:51.416
I'm gonna need another set of those cufflinks.

57:52.052 --> 57:53.213
What the hell?

57:54.513 --> 57:56.880
Walter. Walter!

57:57.766 --> 57:58.927
Walter!

57:59.017 --> 58:00.883
- Gerri, where's Walter?
- Right here.

58:00.978 --> 58:03.846
Why the hell is Senator Engle
suddenly off my list?

58:03.897 --> 58:06.264
He's paralyzed
with a malignant brain tumor, sir.

58:06.358 --> 58:08.395
- Recovering from surgery.
- Holy shit.

58:08.443 --> 58:11.231
- Well, is he conscious?
- I don't know, sir.

58:11.905 --> 58:13.862
Well, find out, God damn it.

58:14.241 --> 58:16.198
If he's conscious, he can vote!

58:16.827 --> 58:18.238
...but I know my Bible.

58:18.286 --> 58:22.246
And the Bible does not say
that we cannot choose our own neighbor.

58:22.290 --> 58:23.371
The Bible does not say

58:23.417 --> 58:27.457
that we cannot build a wall
betwixt ourselves and our neighbor.

58:27.754 --> 58:31.088
What I need
is some help on this cloture vote.

58:31.925 --> 58:35.384
No? Well, I'll tell you
what protects a small state, Alan,

58:35.721 --> 58:37.883
and it damn sure isn't a filibuster rule.

58:37.931 --> 58:40.765
It's a strong president who's in your corner.

58:43.020 --> 58:46.934
What? Now where on Earth do you get that...

58:47.482 --> 58:50.975
Well, I don't forget these things.
You understand me?

58:51.611 --> 58:54.854
Son of a bitch. I thought I had him.

58:55.449 --> 58:57.190
Now, for a man named Bible,

58:57.284 --> 58:59.697
he sure doesn't have a handle
on the New Testament.

59:00.954 --> 59:03.446
This bill will guarantee
the commercial destruction

59:03.832 --> 59:05.949
of white people everywhere!

59:06.877 --> 59:08.709
Senator Cannon, listen,

59:08.795 --> 59:13.335
Carl Hayden and I are finally putting together
the Central Arizona Water Project.

59:14.092 --> 59:17.256
And if Nevada wants any part of this,
I need your vote.

59:18.805 --> 59:22.173
Yes, yes, yes,
I know how Alan Bible feels about it,

59:22.267 --> 59:23.803
but I'm talking to you now,

59:24.394 --> 59:26.477
combat veteran to combat veteran.

59:27.314 --> 59:28.896
Yeah.

59:29.524 --> 59:31.857
Yeah, it is a big damn decision,

59:32.694 --> 59:35.186
but Democrats have to stick together here.

59:38.158 --> 59:42.277
Listen, now... No, Howard, just...
Howard, listen to me, will you?

59:42.662 --> 59:44.073
Just listen to me.

59:44.623 --> 59:46.080
Now,

59:46.416 --> 59:50.831
we both got tough election fights
ahead of us here.

59:50.879 --> 59:53.838
You know I'm gonna be there for you
when it counts,

59:53.882 --> 59:56.966
and can I count on you now?

01:00:02.307 --> 01:00:04.014
Howard, you do the right thing here,

01:00:04.226 --> 01:00:08.015
and you're gonna help yourself,
and you're gonna help your state,

01:00:09.022 --> 01:00:10.854
and you're gonna help your country.

01:00:11.858 --> 01:00:13.770
Will you vote for cloture?

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:23.989
Howard, you're a good man.
Thank you. Bye-bye.

01:00:24.746 --> 01:00:27.989
- Sixty-seven votes!
- Congratulations.

01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:31.250
Should we let Senator Dirksen
make the public announcement?

01:00:31.336 --> 01:00:34.249
You think there's any way we can stop him?

01:00:38.009 --> 01:00:43.505
<i>We believe all men are entitled
to the blessings of liberty.</i>

01:00:45.016 --> 01:00:51.604
Yet millions are deprived of those blessings.

01:00:51.690 --> 01:00:55.775
Not because of their own failures,

01:00:56.695 --> 01:00:59.904
but because of the color of their skin.

01:01:01.324 --> 01:01:04.112
This cannot continue.

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:07.453
Our Constitution forbids it.

01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:11.582
The principles of freedom forbid it.

01:01:12.544 --> 01:01:16.254
And the law I will now sign forbids it.

01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:18.080
Thank you,

01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:20.541
<i>and good day.</i>

01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:33.012
Reverend King.

01:01:35.609 --> 01:01:37.521
We did it.

01:01:38.653 --> 01:01:39.985
We got it done.

01:01:40.071 --> 01:01:41.607
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:42.734
There you go, Everett.

01:01:42.782 --> 01:01:44.023
- Congratulations
- I appreciate it.

01:01:44.117 --> 01:01:46.234
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- Dr. King.

01:01:46.286 --> 01:01:48.243
I need to see Dr. King, you hear.

01:01:49.289 --> 01:01:50.621
- There you are.
- Here, Mr. President.

01:01:50.957 --> 01:01:53.449
- It's for you, sir.
- It's an honor, Mr. President.

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:55.542
Likewise. Thank you.

01:01:57.130 --> 01:01:58.541
Hear, hear.

01:02:15.982 --> 01:02:17.189
I'm sorry, Dick.

01:02:17.275 --> 01:02:18.482
No, you're not.

01:02:20.612 --> 01:02:22.774
It's not personal. It's just politics.

01:02:24.324 --> 01:02:26.281
It's the passing of an era.

01:02:26.326 --> 01:02:27.692
Well, yes, it is.

01:02:27.994 --> 01:02:31.158
It's the passing of a time
of etiquette, courtesy.

01:02:31.831 --> 01:02:35.495
It's the passing of a time of principles
like party unity.

01:02:37.837 --> 01:02:40.580
You know
what the old soldier said on parade?

01:02:41.299 --> 01:02:44.542
"Hey, look, everybody's out of step but me."

01:02:44.636 --> 01:02:46.093
Maybe.

01:02:46.429 --> 01:02:49.513
I am old, that's true, and God knows I'm tired.

01:02:50.809 --> 01:02:55.725
But the fellas coming up behind me
are utterly without principle of any kind,

01:02:55.814 --> 01:02:58.181
and you'll see how you like dealing with them.

01:02:59.859 --> 01:03:02.101
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone.

01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:04.854
I still need you, Dick.

01:03:06.908 --> 01:03:08.900
I'm still here, Mr. President.

01:03:10.203 --> 01:03:12.160
But the rest of Dixie?

01:03:15.542 --> 01:03:18.376
I hope you haven't just killed
your election chances.

01:03:26.261 --> 01:03:29.845
Congratulations, Mr. President,
on your glorious achievement.

01:03:31.850 --> 01:03:36.891
The Democratic Party just lost the South
for the rest of my lifetime,

01:03:36.938 --> 01:03:38.349
and maybe yours.

01:03:42.319 --> 01:03:44.311
What the fuck are you so happy about?

01:04:00.045 --> 01:04:01.957
<i>Senator Goldwater's triumph</i>

01:04:02.047 --> 01:04:05.290
<i>takes the leadership of his party
away from the eastern liberal block</i>

01:04:05.383 --> 01:04:09.593
<i>and places it with the western conservatives
for the first time since 1936.</i>

01:04:12.098 --> 01:04:13.339
<i>Clausewitz said...</i>

01:04:13.433 --> 01:04:14.674
Marjorie.

01:04:15.685 --> 01:04:19.019
<i>"Politics is war by other means."</i>

01:04:22.442 --> 01:04:23.774
<i>Bullshit.</i>

01:04:23.818 --> 01:04:26.731
<i>- Politics is war, period.</i>
- Congratulations, Daddy.

01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:27.816
Thank you.

01:04:27.906 --> 01:04:32.196
<i>That moderation
in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.</i>

01:04:33.286 --> 01:04:35.118
<i>Let me remind you also</i>

01:04:35.455 --> 01:04:40.450
<i>that extremism in the defense of liberty
is no vice.</i>

01:04:42.128 --> 01:04:44.120
<i>You know
how you win a campaign?</i>

01:04:44.798 --> 01:04:46.380
<i>By not losing it.</i>

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:48.211
Good morning, Mr. President.

01:04:48.927 --> 01:04:52.420
<i>I only lost one election
my whole life.</i>

01:04:53.139 --> 01:04:55.973
<i>The son of a bitch stole it from me
in the final seconds</i>

01:04:56.059 --> 01:04:58.176
<i>with a handful of fake votes,</i>

01:04:58.269 --> 01:05:02.434
<i>and I will carry the pain of that with me
to my dying day.</i>

01:05:02.482 --> 01:05:04.223
<i>But I'll tell you what.</i>

01:05:05.402 --> 01:05:08.566
<i>Nobody will ever do me that way again.</i>

01:05:08.655 --> 01:05:10.271
<i>...that every fiber of my being...</i>

01:05:10.323 --> 01:05:11.985
<i>It'll be some other way.</i>

01:05:13.159 --> 01:05:15.993
...<i>that nothing shall be lacking
from the struggle...</i>

01:05:59.789 --> 01:06:01.280
Out of the car, boys.

01:06:01.958 --> 01:06:04.496
What's the problem, Deputy Price?
I thought we were good.

01:06:04.961 --> 01:06:07.829
Out of the car, Jew boy.

01:06:33.907 --> 01:06:35.739
What you looking at, nigger?

01:06:37.952 --> 01:06:40.160
- We've got a situation in Mississippi.
- Yeah?

01:06:41.164 --> 01:06:42.996
Three young men have gone missing.

01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:45.498
Michael Schwerner, age 25,

01:06:45.585 --> 01:06:48.874
Andrew Goodman, age 21,
and James Chaney, 21.

01:06:49.839 --> 01:06:52.627
They were all working
the Freedom Summer project in Meridian.

01:06:53.635 --> 01:06:54.967
Chaney's a local Negro,

01:06:55.053 --> 01:06:58.467
but Schwerner and Goodman
were both out-of-state volunteers,

01:06:58.723 --> 01:06:59.759
both white.

01:07:00.892 --> 01:07:03.384
Well, the shit will hit the fan now.

01:07:06.356 --> 01:07:07.938
Get me the governor of Mississippi.

01:07:08.441 --> 01:07:12.105
They were investigating the burning
of a Negro church in Neshoba County.

01:07:12.195 --> 01:07:13.606
They've been missing for 15 hours now.

01:07:15.782 --> 01:07:17.318
Missing in Mississippi?

01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:20.117
Son of a bitch.

01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:25.327
Yeah. All right, put him through.

01:07:26.709 --> 01:07:29.247
Governor, I'm calling about those three boys.

01:07:29.295 --> 01:07:31.787
You mean those three professional agitators.

01:07:31.839 --> 01:07:34.081
<i>Chaney, Schwerner, and Goodman.</i>

01:07:34.342 --> 01:07:37.961
Yeah, that come into our state
creating all kinds of problems.

01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:39.340
<i>Apparently,</i>

01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:43.140
a Deputy Price arrested them
yesterday afternoon.

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:46.268
For driving 35 miles over the speed limit.

01:07:46.521 --> 01:07:47.978
- Really?
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

01:07:48.022 --> 01:07:50.856
So they held them for a couple hours.

01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:53.858
<i>Oh, see, now that's where it gets confusing</i>

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:57.609
'cause when their friends
called the jail down there,

01:07:57.657 --> 01:08:00.365
the deputy said he had never heard of them.

01:08:01.661 --> 01:08:04.199
Well, I don't know anything about that.

01:08:04.664 --> 01:08:05.654
Uh...

01:08:06.708 --> 01:08:10.668
Price said he released them
at 10:00 that night.

01:08:11.045 --> 01:08:12.911
And nobody's heard of them since.

01:08:13.506 --> 01:08:16.670
This is clearly a publicity stunt.

01:08:17.926 --> 01:08:20.965
Well, those boys are off hiding somewhere,

01:08:21.014 --> 01:08:23.006
<i>probably having themselves a good laugh.</i>

01:08:23.057 --> 01:08:24.514
<i>And they're gonna come back in,</i>

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:27.014
<i>they're gonna claim
they were abused or something.</i>

01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:28.723
Well, now I'd hate to have to send

01:08:28.813 --> 01:08:31.305
a whole bunch of federal marshals
into your state.

01:08:32.984 --> 01:08:34.770
Well, no, you don't wanna do that.

01:08:34.861 --> 01:08:36.147
<i>Of course I don't.</i>

01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:39.904
You don't want the publicity,
and I sure as hell don't wanna stir up a mess

01:08:39.991 --> 01:08:42.153
just eight weeks
before the Democratic Convention.

01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:45.027
<i>But there's a lot of pressure to do something.</i>

01:08:45.078 --> 01:08:46.991
<i>Now, if you'd rather,</i>

01:08:47.372 --> 01:08:50.662
<i>I guess I can get a few FBI agents
to look into the thing.</i>

01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:52.459
FBI?

01:08:53.004 --> 01:08:54.870
Well, it's a damn sight better

01:08:54.921 --> 01:08:57.255
than the federal marshals
and the US Army, isn't it?

01:08:58.676 --> 01:09:01.089
Well, yes, I guess that would.

01:09:01.554 --> 01:09:05.173
Yeah, you know, I think you got
the right idea there, Governor.

01:09:05.725 --> 01:09:08.559
Let this be Hoover's problem, not ours.

01:09:09.187 --> 01:09:10.803
Hopefully, you're right about the whole thing,

01:09:10.897 --> 01:09:13.856
and these boys will turn up quick,
and we can all just relax.

01:09:14.067 --> 01:09:15.774
Christ's sake, we got an election to win.

01:09:16.361 --> 01:09:17.852
Hoover will just drag his feet.

01:09:17.904 --> 01:09:20.066
Not if I light a fire under his ass.

01:09:26.371 --> 01:09:27.452
Mr. President.

01:09:27.537 --> 01:09:28.904
<i>Uh, Edgar,</i>

01:09:28.956 --> 01:09:34.577
the governor of Mississippi wants the FBI
to look into these missing kids.

01:09:34.921 --> 01:09:39.256
Well, I'd be happy to, Mr. President,
but there's a jurisdictional problem.

01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:41.792
Well, I'm not gonna tell you
how to run your shop,

01:09:41.886 --> 01:09:47.176
but the governor asked specifically
for the FBI to investigate.

01:09:47.767 --> 01:09:53.604
I tried to put him off, but, well, I suppose
I could get some third party involved.

01:09:54.857 --> 01:09:58.350
I know Senator Jim Eastland
wants Allen Dulles investigating.

01:09:58.569 --> 01:10:01.061
CIA? Oh, no, Mr. President.

01:10:01.948 --> 01:10:05.942
I don't think Dulles is a good idea.
This is very clearly an FBI matter.

01:10:06.494 --> 01:10:08.281
<i>Well, if you're sure.</i>

01:10:08.871 --> 01:10:12.831
<i>I mean, the last thing I would want
is Dulles down there</i>

01:10:12.917 --> 01:10:15.330
<i>acting like he was running the FBI as well.</i>

01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:18.663
I'll tell you what,
let's say Eastland is my problem.

01:10:18.756 --> 01:10:20.292
I'll just deal with him.

01:10:20.341 --> 01:10:22.754
You get your agents down there
to Neshoba County,

01:10:22.802 --> 01:10:24.885
and you just wrap this thing up quick, yeah?

01:10:26.013 --> 01:10:29.381
When did you talk to Eastland
about Dulles going down there?

01:10:29.475 --> 01:10:31.137
Oh, I made that part up.

01:10:32.645 --> 01:10:35.513
The problem here is
there's three sovereignties involved.

01:10:36.607 --> 01:10:40.317
There's the United States,
there's the state of Mississippi,

01:10:41.487 --> 01:10:44.446
and then there's J. Edgar Hoover.

01:10:52.665 --> 01:10:55.499
<i>The burned-out station wagon
was discovered in the woods</i>

01:10:55.585 --> 01:10:57.872
<i>20 miles from Philadelphia, Mississippi,</i>

01:10:57.962 --> 01:11:00.500
<i>a small town in which Schwerner,
Goodman, and Chaney</i>

01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:02.832
<i>had been arrested for speeding
during the day.</i>

01:11:02.925 --> 01:11:05.212
<i>They were released late at night
by a deputy sheriff</i>

01:11:05.303 --> 01:11:09.388
<i>and were last seen driving away
in the blue station wagon.</i>

01:11:09.474 --> 01:11:11.807
We have to assume
those young men are dead.

01:11:12.685 --> 01:11:14.517
There were no bodies in the car they found.

01:11:14.854 --> 01:11:17.813
Well, then they're probably on vacation,
huh, Mr. Wilkins.

01:11:18.399 --> 01:11:21.767
I mean, I always set my car on fire
before taking a weekend off.

01:11:22.445 --> 01:11:24.357
How many voters
have you actually registered?

01:11:28.493 --> 01:11:30.530
- Twelve hundred, give or take.
- Mmm.

01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:33.908
Five hundred beaten and arrested,
35 churches burned,

01:11:33.998 --> 01:11:39.460
30 Negro homes and businesses dynamited
for 1,200 votes.

01:11:39.545 --> 01:11:41.537
It's not just about the votes.

01:11:41.881 --> 01:11:45.295
For the first time, black people
are building a new political party.

01:11:45.384 --> 01:11:47.296
The Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party,
I heard.

01:11:47.386 --> 01:11:52.552
Hold on. We tried to play by the rules
of the regular Democrat Party,

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:54.182
but they kept us out.

01:11:54.227 --> 01:11:58.722
Fine. So we built our own Democrat Party,
but with a difference.

01:11:58.815 --> 01:12:01.558
Open to everybody, white or Negro.

01:12:01.943 --> 01:12:03.650
Well, don't you think
that America ought to have

01:12:03.736 --> 01:12:05.693
at least one political party that isn't racist?

01:12:05.738 --> 01:12:06.819
It's a waste of time.

01:12:07.073 --> 01:12:09.690
We send our delegates to the convention

01:12:09.742 --> 01:12:11.483
where they challenge the legality

01:12:11.577 --> 01:12:14.570
of the segregated Mississippi delegation
on national TV

01:12:14.664 --> 01:12:16.246
and dare LBJ not to seat us.

01:12:20.419 --> 01:12:22.081
Children playing with dynamite.

01:12:23.089 --> 01:12:25.547
Are you so desperate for their approval

01:12:26.092 --> 01:12:28.755
that you would sanction this mass suicide?

01:12:29.554 --> 01:12:32.342
Those young men went down to Mississippi
and died

01:12:32.431 --> 01:12:35.048
doing the work
the government hasn't been willing to do

01:12:35.101 --> 01:12:36.842
for 100 years.

01:12:38.104 --> 01:12:39.561
We've got to take a stand.

01:12:45.194 --> 01:12:46.935
I grieve for those young men.

01:12:48.531 --> 01:12:52.195
Don't use their funeral pyre
to burn what's left of the movement.

01:13:00.459 --> 01:13:01.916
How can I help, Bob?

01:13:03.045 --> 01:13:05.128
- Come to Mississippi.
- Don't be ridiculous.

01:13:05.214 --> 01:13:08.082
Show the people that you are behind
the Mississippi Freedom...

01:13:08.134 --> 01:13:11.502
You might as well paint a target on his back
and declare open season.

01:13:12.013 --> 01:13:15.131
Martin, you have not been to Mississippi
in over a year.

01:13:15.182 --> 01:13:16.468
He's been busy.

01:13:16.976 --> 01:13:18.842
Death threats, jail, shot at.

01:13:19.186 --> 01:13:22.805
- You don't own a monopoly over suffering.
- I never said that I did.

01:13:23.733 --> 01:13:25.645
Let somebody else carry this one, Martin.

01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:29.106
Please.

01:13:36.913 --> 01:13:38.495
Of course I'll come.

01:13:40.541 --> 01:13:43.625
FBI was acting on a tip
about a farm in rural Mississippi,

01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:46.753
and they just found two bodies buried there
in an earthen dam.

01:13:46.839 --> 01:13:49.673
Jesus. Are they sure it's them?

01:13:49.717 --> 01:13:53.336
Schwerner's draft card in his back pocket.
Goodman's body right below his.

01:13:53.846 --> 01:13:56.680
It appears they had both been shot
once in the chest.

01:13:56.766 --> 01:13:58.257
And they're still digging for Chaney.

01:13:58.351 --> 01:13:59.933
God damn.

01:14:00.811 --> 01:14:02.018
Bless those boys.

01:14:04.065 --> 01:14:06.853
The minute McNamara gets here,
you send him in.

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:12.358
Gentlemen, we need to pick up
this conversation some other time.

01:14:12.406 --> 01:14:13.692
I'm sorry.

01:14:16.452 --> 01:14:20.321
It's obvious that this Deputy Price
was involved in that.

01:14:20.373 --> 01:14:21.784
Probably the sheriff, too.

01:14:21.874 --> 01:14:23.035
Oh, Lord.

01:14:23.793 --> 01:14:26.536
Well, this whole mess is in my lap now.

01:14:27.797 --> 01:14:29.880
If I don't charge these bastards,

01:14:29.924 --> 01:14:32.758
then King yells
that I'm letting them get away with murder.

01:14:32.843 --> 01:14:35.836
But if I do charge them,
then all the Southerners scream

01:14:35.888 --> 01:14:38.255
about how I'm taking orders
from the Negroes,

01:14:38.349 --> 01:14:41.717
and all this two weeks before the start
of the goddamn convention.

01:14:41.769 --> 01:14:43.852
Mr. President, I'm sorry to have to tell you,

01:14:43.896 --> 01:14:47.014
but the word is Governor Wallace
has offered himself to Goldwater

01:14:47.066 --> 01:14:49.604
as the Republican vice presidential candidate.

01:14:50.236 --> 01:14:54.355
That little weasel would sell his mother
to get a leg up.

01:14:55.032 --> 01:14:58.241
And Strom Thurmond
is formally switching parties.

01:14:58.285 --> 01:15:00.151
That motherfucker!

01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:02.366
Is anybody gonna follow him?

01:15:02.415 --> 01:15:03.951
- Well, I don't know.
- Well, find out.

01:15:04.583 --> 01:15:05.664
You bet I will.

01:15:05.751 --> 01:15:07.083
God damn it.

01:15:14.802 --> 01:15:16.168
You see her on TV?

01:15:17.346 --> 01:15:19.212
- Who?
- The...

01:15:20.599 --> 01:15:22.716
The dead kid's wife, Schwerner.

01:15:22.935 --> 01:15:25.268
Uh... Rita, Rita.

01:15:25.354 --> 01:15:27.892
Wife. Widow, I mean.

01:15:29.233 --> 01:15:30.349
- Christ.
- Terrible.

01:15:32.987 --> 01:15:34.444
Mr. President, we have word.

01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:37.276
No, no. Come on.

01:15:39.785 --> 01:15:41.071
Yeah. Sit there.

01:15:42.913 --> 01:15:44.529
All right, Robert.

01:15:45.458 --> 01:15:49.873
Captain Herrick of the <i>USS Maddox</i>
reports a potential sighting last night

01:15:50.463 --> 01:15:54.252
of two possibly hostile unidentified vessels
in the Gulf of Tonkin.

01:15:55.176 --> 01:15:58.294
And some somewhat
contradictory sonar evidence

01:15:58.345 --> 01:15:59.802
of actual torpedo attack.

01:16:01.807 --> 01:16:02.843
Uh...

01:16:02.933 --> 01:16:06.222
"A potential sighting"?
What the hell's a potential sighting?

01:16:07.021 --> 01:16:09.604
A visual sighting
not confirmed by mechanical means.

01:16:11.317 --> 01:16:14.151
And this torpedo attack,
this actually happened?

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:16.357
Still awaiting confirmation.

01:16:17.239 --> 01:16:20.482
Well, were any of our ships hit?

01:16:20.534 --> 01:16:22.150
No, sir.

01:16:22.203 --> 01:16:25.537
- Were there any explosions?
- No, sir.

01:16:25.623 --> 01:16:28.661
Then how the hell do we know
we were attacked?

01:16:29.085 --> 01:16:31.168
We don't, for sure.

01:16:31.212 --> 01:16:34.501
We have contradictory sonar readings.

01:16:34.548 --> 01:16:36.414
For God's sake, Robert.

01:16:36.509 --> 01:16:38.546
Give me something I can work with here.

01:16:39.595 --> 01:16:42.929
Officially, this is a very delicate subject.

01:16:44.225 --> 01:16:46.467
Oh, Humphrey can know.

01:16:48.187 --> 01:16:52.056
Mr. President, the limited air strikes
you ordered pre-selected

01:16:52.149 --> 01:16:54.857
- in case of another attack are good to go.
- Air strikes?

01:16:54.902 --> 01:16:57.440
- Shall we order them in?
- Surely, this is a situation

01:16:57.530 --> 01:16:59.943
about which we ought to be
more confident before we act.

01:17:00.032 --> 01:17:03.867
There's no sense in pretending
last night's event didn't happen, not anymore.

01:17:03.953 --> 01:17:06.866
- What do you mean?
- There's been a leak somewhere.

01:17:06.956 --> 01:17:10.040
- Who? Who leaked it?
- We're tracking it down.

01:17:10.126 --> 01:17:12.083
I want his fucking head in a basket!

01:17:13.546 --> 01:17:15.879
The point is, the press has got to it somehow.

01:17:15.965 --> 01:17:17.877
God damn it.

01:17:17.925 --> 01:17:21.259
Now there are domestic
considerations as well.

01:17:21.345 --> 01:17:23.086
Yeah, Goldwater.

01:17:24.223 --> 01:17:25.759
Don't retaliate,

01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:27.807
he will play all the angles against you.

01:17:27.893 --> 01:17:31.557
All this soft-on-military bullshit.

01:17:31.647 --> 01:17:34.390
Christ, the Democrats beat Hitler and T-oj-o.

01:17:34.483 --> 01:17:36.065
What more do we have to do?

01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:37.897
You want me to call in the retaliatory strikes?

01:17:37.987 --> 01:17:40.730
For an attack which may
or may not have happened?

01:17:40.781 --> 01:17:42.568
Planes are ready to go on your command.

01:17:42.616 --> 01:17:44.903
Mr. President, this puts you
in a terrible position.

01:17:44.952 --> 01:17:47.444
- You are essentially going to have to lie.
- Mr. President!

01:17:55.588 --> 01:17:56.704
Do it.

01:17:57.798 --> 01:17:59.084
Yes, sir.

01:18:02.303 --> 01:18:05.762
If it gets out, we'll pass it off
on our South Vietnamese allies.

01:18:05.806 --> 01:18:08.344
- Mr. President...
- What, you think I like this?

01:18:08.434 --> 01:18:09.800
Putting my ass in a sling

01:18:09.894 --> 01:18:11.180
- this close to the election?
- Sir...

01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:13.136
Or maybe you think Goldwater
ought to be president.

01:18:13.230 --> 01:18:14.471
- Is that it?
- I never said that.

01:18:14.565 --> 01:18:16.477
That maniac wants to lob an A-bomb

01:18:16.567 --> 01:18:19.184
into the Kremlin's bathroom
and start World War III.

01:18:19.278 --> 01:18:21.645
- You see how you like that.
- Mr. President, come on.

01:18:21.739 --> 01:18:24.482
If Goldwater gets elected,
you can forget about poverty.

01:18:24.575 --> 01:18:27.784
You can forget about civil rights.
Is that what you want?

01:18:27.870 --> 01:18:32.865
Now, I'm trying to turn this country around
and prevent a major war!

01:18:32.958 --> 01:18:38.374
Christ, why the hell did I ever
consider you for my vice president?

01:18:38.464 --> 01:18:41.707
First sign of trouble, you cut and run.

01:18:42.843 --> 01:18:46.211
I'm not running anywhere, Mr. President.

01:18:46.305 --> 01:18:48.797
I'm standing right here beside you.

01:18:49.475 --> 01:18:51.967
Precious cold comfort you are.

01:18:54.855 --> 01:18:57.768
You know, Congress
is gonna back me on this.

01:18:57.816 --> 01:18:59.648
It's election year.

01:19:00.569 --> 01:19:04.563
I'll get them to pass some kind of resolution

01:19:04.657 --> 01:19:06.990
authorizing me full authority over there.

01:19:07.034 --> 01:19:10.118
Then we can get back
to things that really matter.

01:19:11.288 --> 01:19:12.699
- Sir?
- What?

01:19:13.332 --> 01:19:15.119
They found Chaney's body.

01:19:23.008 --> 01:19:24.715
God damn it.

01:19:27.638 --> 01:19:30.551
<i>The bodies of the
three missing civil rights workers,</i>

01:19:30.641 --> 01:19:32.507
<i>Schwerner, Chaney, and Goodman,</i>

01:19:32.559 --> 01:19:35.017
<i>were found in a grave
at the base of an earthen dam</i>

01:19:35.104 --> 01:19:37.687
<i>outside of Philadelphia, Mississippi.</i>

01:19:37.731 --> 01:19:41.566
<i>Their bodies were wrapped
in plastic bags numbered one, two, and three.</i>

01:19:41.652 --> 01:19:45.362
<i>They were taken to the medical center
in Jackson for examination.</i>

01:19:45.406 --> 01:19:50.618
<i>...far too small</i>

01:19:51.370 --> 01:19:57.116
<i>Love so amazing</i>

01:19:57.751 --> 01:20:01.495
<i>Love so divine</i>

01:20:02.506 --> 01:20:07.877
<i>Demands my soul</i>

01:20:09.054 --> 01:20:11.011
<i>My life</i>

01:20:11.849 --> 01:20:16.890
<i>My all</i>

01:20:17.479 --> 01:20:20.893
Amen.

01:20:27.031 --> 01:20:30.115
James Chaney gave his life

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:33.910
to make this country live up
to its forgotten promises

01:20:33.996 --> 01:20:37.160
and unfulfilled ideals.

01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:40.288
- Yes, he did.
- We all know

01:20:40.377 --> 01:20:44.462
the terrible pain
you must be feeling in your hearts.

01:20:44.548 --> 01:20:46.164
That's right.

01:20:46.258 --> 01:20:49.626
But we will not live in despair.

01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:50.756
No.

01:20:50.846 --> 01:20:52.803
We will not surrender.

01:20:52.890 --> 01:20:53.926
No.

01:20:53.974 --> 01:20:55.465
We will continue

01:20:55.559 --> 01:20:59.473
to respond to their violence
with love and forgiveness.

01:20:59.563 --> 01:21:01.395
Amen.

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:02.851
As I stand here...

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:06.977
Who said that? Who said that?

01:21:07.071 --> 01:21:12.863
...I not only blame
the people who pulled the trigger

01:21:12.951 --> 01:21:15.614
or dug the hole with their shovel.

01:21:16.955 --> 01:21:19.743
I blame the state of Mississippi,

01:21:20.959 --> 01:21:24.623
all the way on up to the people
in Washington for what happened.

01:21:24.671 --> 01:21:27.584
- Now, that's enough of that!
- No.

01:21:27.633 --> 01:21:29.295
It's all right.

01:21:29.385 --> 01:21:31.251
Come on up here.

01:21:33.722 --> 01:21:39.889
I'm sick and tired
of going to funerals for black men

01:21:39.978 --> 01:21:42.812
who have been murdered by white men.

01:21:42.856 --> 01:21:43.892
Yes.

01:21:43.982 --> 01:21:46.395
- Are you?
- Yes!

01:21:46.485 --> 01:21:48.602
Are you sick and tired of this stuff like I am?

01:21:48.654 --> 01:21:50.395
Yes!

01:21:50.864 --> 01:21:52.776
I'm not feeling sad tonight, Dr. King.

01:21:55.577 --> 01:21:57.864
I'm not feeling forgiveness.

01:21:57.955 --> 01:21:59.287
Preach.

01:22:00.165 --> 01:22:02.498
I've got vengeance in my heart!

01:22:04.086 --> 01:22:06.874
And I'm asking you to feel angry with me.

01:22:06.964 --> 01:22:08.830
- Yes.
- Are you angry?

01:22:08.924 --> 01:22:10.085
Yes!

01:22:10.175 --> 01:22:15.011
The white men who murdered James Chaney
are never gonna be punished!

01:22:15.055 --> 01:22:16.842
That's right!

01:22:16.890 --> 01:22:21.851
The best way to remember James Chaney

01:22:21.895 --> 01:22:24.854
is to demand our rights.

01:22:24.898 --> 01:22:30.235
If you go back home and take
what these white men are doing to us...

01:22:32.448 --> 01:22:36.032
If you take it and don't do something about it,

01:22:36.076 --> 01:22:38.238
then God damn your souls!

01:22:38.328 --> 01:22:40.035
Stand up!

01:22:41.707 --> 01:22:44.916
- We got to stand up in Meridian!
- Yeah!

01:22:45.002 --> 01:22:47.585
We got to stand up in Jackson!

01:22:47.671 --> 01:22:48.832
Stand up!

01:22:48.881 --> 01:22:50.793
And when we get to Atlantic City,

01:22:50.883 --> 01:22:53.546
- what are we going to do?
- Stand up!

01:22:53.635 --> 01:22:55.797
- Stand up!
- Stand up!

01:22:55.888 --> 01:22:57.379
- Stand up!
- Stand up!

01:22:57.431 --> 01:22:59.548
- Stand up!
- Stand up!

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:01.091
Stand up! Stand up!

01:23:01.185 --> 01:23:02.972
Stand up! Stand up!

01:23:03.061 --> 01:23:05.223
Stand up! Stand up!

01:23:05.314 --> 01:23:08.682
One man, one vote! One man, one vote!

01:23:08.734 --> 01:23:10.646
One man, one vote!

01:23:10.736 --> 01:23:13.479
One man, one vote! One man, one vote!

01:23:13.739 --> 01:23:15.651
You must seat the MFDP.

01:23:15.741 --> 01:23:19.280
- Martin, it's not that simple.
- Yes, it is.

01:23:19.369 --> 01:23:22.908
Now, you don't understand
the depth of feeling among my people.

01:23:22.956 --> 01:23:25.790
These murders, they've rocked the movement.

01:23:25.876 --> 01:23:29.290
If the government does not
do what is right here,

01:23:29.379 --> 01:23:31.917
nonviolence will no longer be an option.

01:23:35.344 --> 01:23:38.508
<i>You can see
a largely Negro delegation</i>

01:23:38.597 --> 01:23:40.429
<i>from a Southern state appear here,</i>

01:23:40.516 --> 01:23:42.849
<i>claiming to be an alternative delegation.</i>

01:23:42.935 --> 01:23:46.394
It's something I don't think has
happened in the Democratic Convention

01:23:46.438 --> 01:23:48.145
perhaps since Reconstruction days.

01:23:48.232 --> 01:23:50.690
And according to
the Freedom Democratic representatives,

01:23:50.776 --> 01:23:53.018
<i>Dr. Henry, who is their chairman,</i>

01:23:53.111 --> 01:23:56.650
Dr. Martin Luther King,
they are not going to accept any compromise

01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:59.278
short of having some kind
of a vote in this convention.

01:23:59.368 --> 01:24:03.487
Well, I'll certainly take that
under consideration, John.

01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:06.368
...<i>this delegation
being seated, and the other...</i>

01:24:06.458 --> 01:24:12.125
John Connally, the governor of my own state,
just told me, "You seat those black buggers,

01:24:12.214 --> 01:24:15.798
"not only will Texas quit,
but the whole South will walk out."

01:24:15.884 --> 01:24:18.968
We might as well
kiss the whole goddamn election good-bye.

01:24:19.054 --> 01:24:20.795
What the hell do you want?

01:24:20.847 --> 01:24:22.634
The ballot in Alabama, sir,

01:24:22.724 --> 01:24:24.465
apparently Governor Wallace
kept your name off it.

01:24:24.518 --> 01:24:26.885
That little piece of shit.

01:24:26.979 --> 01:24:30.143
- Can he do that?
- Of course he can.

01:24:30.232 --> 01:24:33.145
Goldwater must be laughing his ass off.

01:24:33.193 --> 01:24:37.278
And now they're just threatening to walk out
of the whole goddamn convention!

01:24:39.533 --> 01:24:41.320
Son of a bitch.

01:24:41.368 --> 01:24:44.577
Lyndon, why don't you take a break
from this for a while?

01:24:44.663 --> 01:24:46.325
Oh, I'm fine, Bird.

01:24:46.415 --> 01:24:49.203
Well, you certainly don't sound fine.

01:24:49.293 --> 01:24:52.502
- When's the last time you ate anything?
- Go away, Bird.

01:24:52.588 --> 01:24:53.920
You're giving me a goddamn headache.

01:24:54.006 --> 01:24:55.417
Well, honey, I'm just worried.

01:24:55.507 --> 01:24:57.339
Would you leave me alone?

01:24:57.384 --> 01:24:59.421
Go on, get out of here!

01:24:59.511 --> 01:25:00.501
Go on!

01:25:00.596 --> 01:25:02.258
<i>...watching over every aspect</i>

01:25:02.347 --> 01:25:04.589
<i>and every detail in this process...</i>

01:25:07.352 --> 01:25:10.140
<i>...engaged by
the Mississippi delegation here tonight.</i>

01:25:22.117 --> 01:25:23.107
Oh.

01:25:23.201 --> 01:25:24.533
Thank you.

01:25:30.334 --> 01:25:32.246
I feel so sorry for him.

01:25:32.336 --> 01:25:33.872
I know.

01:25:33.962 --> 01:25:36.295
Thank God he has you, Walter.

01:25:37.341 --> 01:25:38.627
And you.

01:25:42.179 --> 01:25:44.387
You think he's hard on me?

01:25:44.473 --> 01:25:48.717
Well, he's hard on everybody,
especially himself.

01:25:49.353 --> 01:25:51.595
People don't see that.

01:25:51.688 --> 01:25:53.224
But I do.

01:25:53.857 --> 01:25:55.723
I see everything.

01:25:56.234 --> 01:25:58.396
His lady friends.

01:26:02.282 --> 01:26:04.945
But I'm the one he chose. Hmm.

01:26:05.035 --> 01:26:07.243
At the end of the day...

01:26:09.414 --> 01:26:11.747
I'm the one he comes home to.

01:26:17.631 --> 01:26:21.591
My money paid for his first campaign,
did you know that?

01:26:21.677 --> 01:26:25.842
I had to face down my own daddy
over my inheritance to get it.

01:26:26.932 --> 01:26:31.518
By God, it was the best investment
I ever made.

01:26:36.274 --> 01:26:37.765
My lipstick okay?

01:26:38.485 --> 01:26:40.351
You look beautiful.

01:26:41.238 --> 01:26:43.104
No, I'm not.

01:26:43.156 --> 01:26:46.115
But you make do with what you got.

01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:50.449
And whatever happens, you don't quit.

01:26:54.626 --> 01:26:56.538
CBS News <i>correspondent
Mike Wallace here</i>

01:26:56.628 --> 01:26:58.210
<i>at the ballroom of Convention Hall</i>

01:26:58.296 --> 01:27:00.413
<i>where the credentials committee</i>

01:27:00.465 --> 01:27:02.127
of the Democratic National Party
are in session.

01:27:02.217 --> 01:27:04.004
And now we are hearing

01:27:04.094 --> 01:27:07.508
from the Freedom Democratic Party
representatives of Mississippi.

01:27:08.473 --> 01:27:13.059
Just tell the credential committee
what happened in Mississippi, Miss Hamer.

01:27:33.665 --> 01:27:38.501
On January 9th, 1963, I went to a meeting

01:27:38.587 --> 01:27:41.671
to learn how to register
Negro voters in Mississippi.

01:27:43.759 --> 01:27:45.671
On my way back,

01:27:45.719 --> 01:27:51.431
I was arrested by the Winona police chief
and taken to the county jail.

01:27:51.516 --> 01:27:55.601
After I was placed in a cell,

01:27:55.687 --> 01:27:58.680
state highway patrolmen

01:27:58.774 --> 01:28:02.438
ordered me to lay facedown
on the bunk bed, saying,

01:28:04.404 --> 01:28:07.317
"You're gonna wish you was dead."

01:28:08.283 --> 01:28:10.275
Now who the hell is this?

01:28:10.368 --> 01:28:13.532
Fannie Lou Hamer,
a sharecropper's daughter.

01:28:13.622 --> 01:28:16.035
Became one of the leaders of the MFDP.

01:28:16.124 --> 01:28:17.660
For Christ's sake.

01:28:18.668 --> 01:28:20.705
<i>And then he ordered</i>

01:28:22.172 --> 01:28:28.134
<i>two male Negro prisoners
to beat me with a blackjack.</i>

01:28:29.971 --> 01:28:35.968
<i>The first prisoner
beat me till he was exhausted.</i>

01:28:38.855 --> 01:28:43.225
<i>And then the patrolman
ordered the second Negro to beat me.</i>

01:28:45.654 --> 01:28:49.568
- This is awful.
- It sure as hell is.

01:28:49.658 --> 01:28:52.947
She could stampede the liberals
into seating the MFDP,

01:28:53.036 --> 01:28:55.574
and the South will storm out
of the convention in droves.

01:28:55.664 --> 01:28:57.280
Walter!

01:28:57.374 --> 01:28:58.990
Walter, you tell the press

01:28:59.084 --> 01:29:01.167
we got a major announcement
in the Rose Garden.

01:29:01.253 --> 01:29:04.417
- What's the announcement?
- Hell if I know!

01:29:04.464 --> 01:29:08.003
Anything to turn off
those goddamn cameras in Atlantic City.

01:29:09.177 --> 01:29:11.669
I began to scream.

01:29:13.598 --> 01:29:20.266
And one white man hit me in my head
and told me to hush.

01:29:23.984 --> 01:29:27.773
My dress had worked up high,
so I pulled it down.

01:29:29.406 --> 01:29:33.571
And another white man walked over
and pulled it back up.

01:29:39.833 --> 01:29:42.450
All this

01:29:42.502 --> 01:29:47.588
on account of we wanna register to vote.

01:29:51.678 --> 01:29:56.764
And if the Freedom Democratic Party
is not seated at this convention,

01:29:56.808 --> 01:29:59.721
I question America.

01:29:59.811 --> 01:30:02.303
Is this America?

01:30:03.857 --> 01:30:07.646
The land of the free and the home of the brave

01:30:07.694 --> 01:30:10.357
where our lives be threatened daily

01:30:10.447 --> 01:30:15.033
'cause we wanna live
as decent human beings.

01:30:15.994 --> 01:30:18.156
All we're asking

01:30:18.246 --> 01:30:21.114
- is fair representation of this...
- Hold on.

01:30:22.834 --> 01:30:24.826
<i>The president is going
to announce his address</i>

01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:27.503
<i>at the White House in just a few moments.</i>

01:30:27.547 --> 01:30:31.507
<i>Please stand by for
the President of the United States.</i>

01:30:33.219 --> 01:30:35.882
<i>Uh, howdy.</i>

01:30:35.972 --> 01:30:38.009
<i>- First of all, I wanna thank y'all...</i>
- I don't understand.

01:30:38.058 --> 01:30:40.345
- What's going on?
- It appears, Miss Hamer,

01:30:40.435 --> 01:30:42.552
we've been preempted by the President.

01:30:42.646 --> 01:30:45.354
<i>- I know a lot of people are...</i>
- Come on.

01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:48.183
...still wondering

01:30:48.234 --> 01:30:54.105
who my vice presidential candidate will be.

01:30:54.532 --> 01:30:58.242
And we'll make that decision very, very soon,
I promise you that.

01:30:58.328 --> 01:31:03.039
I think now I can open it up,
and if you'd like to ask a few questions.

01:31:03.124 --> 01:31:07.368
I need to know everything that King
and that Fannie Lou person and Bob Moses

01:31:07.462 --> 01:31:11.206
and all those goddamn people
in the MFDP are talking about.

01:31:11.257 --> 01:31:13.624
I want them under constant surveillance,
the whole bunch of them.

01:31:13.718 --> 01:31:16.210
Mr. President, we don't have any warrant.

01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:21.599
Well, that never stopped you before, did it?

01:31:22.978 --> 01:31:26.767
Now, I don't care what you do
or how you do it.

01:31:26.856 --> 01:31:29.599
In fact, it's better if I don't know.

01:31:29.693 --> 01:31:33.562
But everything you get,
you send it immediately to Walter.

01:31:33.613 --> 01:31:35.980
- You understand?
- Yeah.

01:31:42.831 --> 01:31:46.791
- Uncle Dick.
- You're up awful late, Mr. President.

01:31:46.876 --> 01:31:49.084
You're gonna give yourself
another heart attack.

01:31:49.170 --> 01:31:53.915
<i>Well, if I do, it'll be the Dixiecrats
and Martin Luther King put me in my grave.</i>

01:31:54.926 --> 01:32:00.718
You hear of this public telegram of King's
demanding that I seat the MFDP?

01:32:01.433 --> 01:32:03.095
The whole country will think

01:32:03.184 --> 01:32:05.847
that Negroes have more power
in the Democratic Party

01:32:05.937 --> 01:32:09.396
than the president has,
and the whole South will bolt.

01:32:09.441 --> 01:32:11.273
I warned you about that.

01:32:11.317 --> 01:32:12.774
<i>You know what I think?</i>

01:32:14.446 --> 01:32:18.861
I think this is something that King cooked up
with Bobby Kennedy to embarrass me.

01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:22.864
Now, listen, Kennedy is
gonna stab me in the back

01:32:22.954 --> 01:32:25.446
<i>and steal this nomination at the last minute.</i>

01:32:25.540 --> 01:32:28.874
Mr. President, Robert Kennedy
has no interest whatsoever

01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:31.122
in hurting you or helping Barry Goldwater.

01:32:31.212 --> 01:32:33.454
Then the hell with them all.

01:32:34.382 --> 01:32:37.625
I'm gonna go back home to my ranch
and the people who love me.

01:32:38.261 --> 01:32:40.969
<i>I never wanted to be president
in the first place.</i>

01:32:41.014 --> 01:32:45.258
Mr. President, forgive my frankness,
but you are speaking like a spoiled child.

01:32:45.310 --> 01:32:47.552
You and I both know you're not serious.

01:32:47.645 --> 01:32:50.137
Now take a tranquilizer, go to sleep.

01:32:58.990 --> 01:33:00.322
Thank you.

01:33:06.289 --> 01:33:09.782
I walked into the lion's den,
I argued fervently,

01:33:09.834 --> 01:33:11.166
I used all the heartstrings I had.

01:33:11.252 --> 01:33:12.993
I made no headway.

01:33:13.088 --> 01:33:14.920
God damn it.

01:33:15.006 --> 01:33:18.716
The least the MFDP might be willing to accept

01:33:18.802 --> 01:33:22.591
would be some actual votes
at the convention, a few votes.

01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:24.137
Well, what did King say?

01:33:24.182 --> 01:33:27.095
He's very supportive
of their leadership on this.

01:33:27.185 --> 01:33:30.019
After everything I did for him,
he should've stood up for me!

01:33:30.105 --> 01:33:32.097
Why didn't somebody stand up for me?

01:33:32.190 --> 01:33:34.022
I stood up for you, Mr. President.

01:33:34.109 --> 01:33:35.441
Somebody who matters.

01:33:36.694 --> 01:33:40.153
Well, if you don't think
my loyalty is important...

01:33:40.198 --> 01:33:43.782
Jesus, you are so thin-skinned.

01:33:44.369 --> 01:33:45.655
Shit.

01:33:47.038 --> 01:33:50.031
I depend on you, Hubert, you know that.

01:33:50.917 --> 01:33:54.251
Christ's sake,
there's got to be a solution here.

01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:57.997
Well, maybe we can get

01:33:58.049 --> 01:34:01.963
one or two of the Mississippi regulars
to agree to step aside.

01:34:02.053 --> 01:34:04.170
They claim they're sick or something.

01:34:06.349 --> 01:34:07.715
All right.

01:34:07.809 --> 01:34:12.679
You tell them that they can have
two voting delegates.

01:34:12.730 --> 01:34:16.223
We'll call them "at large delegates."

01:34:16.317 --> 01:34:18.400
But one of them has to be
that white minister of theirs.

01:34:18.444 --> 01:34:19.605
Reverend Edwin King.

01:34:19.696 --> 01:34:21.187
That's him, that's him.

01:34:21.239 --> 01:34:24.027
That way,
it's one white man and only one Negro.

01:34:24.075 --> 01:34:25.907
We'll integrate their delegation.

01:34:25.994 --> 01:34:27.701
Who could argue with that, huh?

01:34:27.745 --> 01:34:29.486
I'll see what I can do.

01:34:29.581 --> 01:34:32.745
Well, don't "see" what you can do!

01:34:33.751 --> 01:34:35.663
You do what I tell you to do.

01:34:37.255 --> 01:34:39.247
Mr. President.

01:34:44.429 --> 01:34:45.920
What you think of Hubert?

01:34:46.973 --> 01:34:49.386
I think he's working as hard as he can.

01:34:49.434 --> 01:34:51.175
Yeah.

01:34:51.269 --> 01:34:52.931
He's nice.

01:34:56.608 --> 01:35:01.319
Nice is what you call a gal with no tits,
no ass, and no personality.

01:35:01.404 --> 01:35:03.896
Nice is for kissing babies.

01:35:03.948 --> 01:35:07.783
There's no place for nice in a knife fight.

01:35:11.206 --> 01:35:13.493
You get me Walter Reuther.

01:35:13.583 --> 01:35:16.326
Mr. President, what a pleasant surprise.

01:35:16.419 --> 01:35:18.251
<i>Well, Reuther,
I know how important</i>

01:35:18.296 --> 01:35:20.162
<i>your golden boy Humphrey is to you</i>

01:35:20.256 --> 01:35:22.122
<i>and the rest of organized labor.</i>

01:35:22.759 --> 01:35:28.630
But if this big delegate war comes off
and the South walks out of the convention,

01:35:28.723 --> 01:35:33.514
<i>he will have no future
in the Democratic Party, you hear me?</i>

01:35:33.603 --> 01:35:35.094
Yes, sir, but I really must...

01:35:35.146 --> 01:35:36.978
Now, you need to tighten your leash

01:35:37.065 --> 01:35:41.184
and bring King
and the MFDP in line or, by God,

01:35:41.277 --> 01:35:45.396
Hubert Humphrey is never gonna be
my vice president or anything else!

01:35:45.490 --> 01:35:48.324
- Sir, I...
- He won't be able to get elected dogcatcher,

01:35:48.409 --> 01:35:51.277
and you won't have
nobody in the Senate to carry water for you.

01:35:51.329 --> 01:35:54.993
Now you get yourself down to Atlantic City
and fix this mess, and I mean now!

01:36:04.092 --> 01:36:05.503
Are you all right, sir?

01:36:08.263 --> 01:36:10.926
I do not have the hide of a rhinoceros.

01:36:13.309 --> 01:36:15.141
You know me, Walter.

01:36:15.186 --> 01:36:18.475
I have a genuine desire to unite people,

01:36:18.523 --> 01:36:22.187
but my own people in the South,
they're against me,

01:36:22.235 --> 01:36:25.148
and the North is against me,
and the Negroes are against me,

01:36:25.196 --> 01:36:28.439
and the press sure doesn't have
any damn affection for me.

01:36:28.533 --> 01:36:31.401
It's not fair, sir, not with all you've done.

01:36:31.494 --> 01:36:34.077
I could drop dead tomorrow,

01:36:34.163 --> 01:36:37.281
and there wouldn't be
10 people who'd shed a tear.

01:36:37.375 --> 01:36:39.332
Ah, no. No, sir. That's not true, sir.

01:36:39.377 --> 01:36:41.369
The hell it ain't.

01:36:45.216 --> 01:36:48.050
People turn on you so fast.

01:36:52.056 --> 01:36:54.969
When my daddy lost everything,

01:36:56.269 --> 01:37:02.937
people who had been glad-handing him
just treated him like dog shit.

01:37:07.196 --> 01:37:12.066
They humiliated him to his face,

01:37:13.828 --> 01:37:15.569
in public.

01:37:21.085 --> 01:37:23.247
And my mother...

01:37:27.425 --> 01:37:30.259
The way she'd freeze him out.

01:37:36.309 --> 01:37:38.892
That's what killed him.

01:37:46.736 --> 01:37:49.194
You know what I think it is?

01:37:51.741 --> 01:37:54.700
People think I want great power,

01:37:56.579 --> 01:38:00.619
but what I want is great solace.

01:38:03.628 --> 01:38:05.460
A little love.

01:38:07.298 --> 01:38:09.631
That's all I want.

01:38:14.305 --> 01:38:17.173
You have that from us, sir.

01:38:17.266 --> 01:38:19.007
From me.

01:38:27.443 --> 01:38:31.858
Poor Marjorie must be wondering
where the hell you are.

01:38:31.948 --> 01:38:34.656
- Oh, she understands.
- Jesus.

01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:39.828
How many kids you got again?
What is it, five?

01:38:39.914 --> 01:38:41.746
- Six.
- Six.

01:38:41.833 --> 01:38:44.246
- Two girls and four boys.
- Phew!

01:38:45.628 --> 01:38:47.995
Right, Catholic.

01:38:54.178 --> 01:38:57.012
I always wanted a son.

01:38:57.098 --> 01:39:01.183
Don't get me wrong, I love Luci and Lynda,

01:39:03.646 --> 01:39:05.979
but a man wants a son.

01:39:12.530 --> 01:39:17.116
I reckon you're as close to that as I've got.

01:39:30.798 --> 01:39:34.291
Walter, you'll be right outside?

01:39:35.011 --> 01:39:36.593
Yes, sir.

01:39:50.902 --> 01:39:52.734
Martin.

01:39:53.779 --> 01:39:55.190
Mr. Reuther.

01:39:55.239 --> 01:39:57.071
Didn't expect to see you here.

01:39:57.158 --> 01:39:59.491
Well, neither did I.

01:39:59.577 --> 01:40:04.789
I got a call from the president
with a generous helping of the Texas twist.

01:40:04.874 --> 01:40:07.332
You've got to get the MFDP to compromise.

01:40:07.418 --> 01:40:09.751
Well, what the president offered was an insult.

01:40:09.837 --> 01:40:11.874
These people have shed their blood...

01:40:11.923 --> 01:40:14.506
Martin, your funding is on the line.

01:40:14.592 --> 01:40:16.675
You've gotta get the MFDP on board,

01:40:16.761 --> 01:40:18.969
or there will be no more
union money for the movement,

01:40:19.055 --> 01:40:20.967
not a single goddamn dime.

01:40:21.057 --> 01:40:24.175
You would sabotage
the entire civil rights movement over this?

01:40:24.268 --> 01:40:25.884
No, you would.

01:40:25.937 --> 01:40:28.145
The number of delegates at a convention,
who gives a shit?

01:40:28.231 --> 01:40:31.065
- It's wrong.
- Look, there will be a final offer.

01:40:31.108 --> 01:40:33.100
You get your people to accept it,

01:40:33.194 --> 01:40:35.436
or you can take your tin cup
and your principles

01:40:35.530 --> 01:40:38.318
out onto the street
and see how far that gets you.

01:40:50.545 --> 01:40:54.710
LBJ! LBJ! LBJ!

01:40:56.926 --> 01:40:59.213
<i>Will the delegates
please be seated?</i>

01:41:01.305 --> 01:41:03.092
- What do we want?
- Freedom!

01:41:03.140 --> 01:41:04.802
- When do we want it?
- Now!

01:41:04.850 --> 01:41:06.967
- What do we want?
- Freedom!

01:41:07.061 --> 01:41:09.178
- When do we want it?
- Now!

01:41:09.272 --> 01:41:13.312
<i>Which side are you on? Everybody, now</i>

01:41:13.442 --> 01:41:16.810
<i>Which side are you on, Lord?</i>

01:41:16.904 --> 01:41:20.272
<i>- Which side are you on? Everybody, now
- Which side are you on?</i>

01:41:20.324 --> 01:41:21.405
Martin. Just...

01:41:21.492 --> 01:41:24.200
<i>Which side are you on, Lord?</i>

01:41:24.287 --> 01:41:26.870
I want everyone to hear this.

01:41:26.956 --> 01:41:30.290
I'm pleased to say that we've come up
with a mighty fine compromise.

01:41:30.334 --> 01:41:34.419
The MFDP will get two voting delegates,
Aaron Henry and Edwin King.

01:41:34.505 --> 01:41:38.795
And the Democratic Party
will adopt a formal rules change

01:41:38.843 --> 01:41:42.132
to prohibit any segregated delegation
in the future.

01:41:42.179 --> 01:41:43.966
This is a major victory.

01:41:44.015 --> 01:41:46.257
Senator Humphrey,
God did not send us to Atlantic City

01:41:46.350 --> 01:41:47.716
- for no two seats.
- That's right.

01:41:47.810 --> 01:41:49.096
When all of us is tired.

01:41:49.186 --> 01:41:51.098
This is just like the white plantation bosses

01:41:51.188 --> 01:41:53.475
making all the decisions
for his black sharecroppers.

01:41:53.524 --> 01:41:55.265
Hold on, Bob.

01:41:55.359 --> 01:41:57.897
You've won your case
in the court of public opinion.

01:41:57.987 --> 01:41:59.728
Now you've got your token representation.

01:41:59.822 --> 01:42:01.939
- "Token"?
- Don't twist my words, Aaron.

01:42:02.033 --> 01:42:05.367
What I am saying is
that there's a whole lot at stake here,

01:42:05.453 --> 01:42:07.570
and this is a necessary political compromise.

01:42:07.663 --> 01:42:10.030
We are not here
to bring politics to our morality.

01:42:10.124 --> 01:42:12.616
We are here
to bring our morality to our politics.

01:42:12.710 --> 01:42:15.453
Dr. King, what do you think we ought to do?

01:42:19.175 --> 01:42:23.260
If I were a Mississippi Negro,
been through what you've been through,

01:42:23.346 --> 01:42:24.757
- I'd vote against it.
- Right.

01:42:24.847 --> 01:42:27.635
But the solemn commitment

01:42:27.725 --> 01:42:30.468
to end discrimination
in all future conventions

01:42:30.561 --> 01:42:33.144
- is a mighty big victory...
- Yes, it is.

01:42:33.230 --> 01:42:36.348
...in which the MFDP can take real pride.

01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:39.063
And as a Negro leader, I'm asking...

01:42:41.072 --> 01:42:43.280
I want you to take this.

01:42:44.033 --> 01:42:48.573
<i>Wade in the water</i>

01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:54.292
<i>Wade in the water, children</i>

01:42:54.377 --> 01:42:59.293
<i>Wade in the water</i>

01:42:59.382 --> 01:43:04.298
<i>God's a-gonna trouble the water</i>

01:43:04.387 --> 01:43:08.882
<i>See that host all dressed in white?</i>

01:43:09.934 --> 01:43:12.096
Well done, Dr. King.

01:43:12.770 --> 01:43:16.889
Solomon himself couldn't have
cut that baby in half any cleaner.

01:43:16.941 --> 01:43:19.854
I may lose a battle, Bob,

01:43:19.944 --> 01:43:23.028
I personally may not survive,
but I will win this war.

01:43:23.114 --> 01:43:24.571
All the way with LBJ.

01:43:24.615 --> 01:43:27.358
LBJ is not the second coming.

01:43:27.451 --> 01:43:29.408
He's just like every other politician.

01:43:29.453 --> 01:43:32.241
He'll do what it takes to get elected.

01:43:32.289 --> 01:43:34.906
But I think he really wants civil rights.

01:43:36.043 --> 01:43:38.035
Now, we've got a chance here, Bob.

01:43:38.129 --> 01:43:39.791
A real chance.

01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:44.545
Best chance in 100 years,
and I will not throw it away.

01:43:49.140 --> 01:43:51.974
<i>Will the delegates
please be seated?</i>

01:43:52.059 --> 01:43:55.928
<i>A workable compromise
regarding at large delegates</i>

01:43:55.980 --> 01:43:57.687
<i>- from Mississippi has been reached.</i>
- All right.

01:43:57.773 --> 01:43:59.890
All right, that's it. We're leaving. Come on.

01:43:59.984 --> 01:44:02.351
<i>And we urge the delegates here
to approve the recommendations</i>

01:44:02.445 --> 01:44:05.233
<i>- of the credentials committee.</i>
- Jim, what the hell's going on?

01:44:05.322 --> 01:44:07.439
LBJ screwed us over.

01:44:07.491 --> 01:44:09.403
He's seating the niggers.

01:44:11.996 --> 01:44:14.113
You boys just stay here. I'll figure this out.

01:44:14.165 --> 01:44:16.873
<i>The credentials committee
settled on a compromise</i>

01:44:16.959 --> 01:44:19.417
<i>of two voting delegates for the MFDP,</i>

01:44:19.503 --> 01:44:23.668
<i>but Mississippi and Alabama
rejected the deal and walked out.</i>

01:44:23.758 --> 01:44:25.545
<i>If Georgia walks out next,</i>

01:44:25.634 --> 01:44:28.047
<i>- the rest of the South will follow.</i>
- Mr. President?

01:44:29.597 --> 01:44:32.840
It's Governor Sanders of Georgia
on the phone.

01:44:32.933 --> 01:44:34.720
What, it's Georgia?

01:44:34.810 --> 01:44:36.142
What the hell does Carl want?

01:44:36.187 --> 01:44:40.306
Alabama and Mississippi are walking out,
and Sanders says he might follow.

01:44:40.357 --> 01:44:41.814
God damn it!

01:44:43.527 --> 01:44:45.063
Carl, what the hell is going on?

01:44:45.154 --> 01:44:49.023
Mr. President, you can't give
these people two seats.

01:44:49.116 --> 01:44:51.733
It's gonna look like the Negroes are
taking over the whole convention.

01:44:51.827 --> 01:44:56.492
Oh, for Christ's sake,
it's one Negro and one white minister.

01:44:56.540 --> 01:44:58.657
Now, it's the principle of the thing.

01:44:58.709 --> 01:45:01.326
Me and my delegates
are about inches from walking out.

01:45:01.378 --> 01:45:02.960
In fact, the whole South's about to bolt.

01:45:03.047 --> 01:45:06.666
All right, now let's you and me
understand something here.

01:45:06.717 --> 01:45:10.131
Those people
are Democrats just like you and me,

01:45:10.221 --> 01:45:12.884
but those good old boys from Mississippi,
they locked them out.

01:45:12.932 --> 01:45:16.016
Well, now they got locked out
because they're not registered to vote.

01:45:16.060 --> 01:45:18.427
Because they wouldn't let them register!

01:45:18.521 --> 01:45:22.105
They beat them and shot them
and lynched them.

01:45:22.191 --> 01:45:24.353
Well, now you're tarring
a lot of people here, Mr. President.

01:45:24.401 --> 01:45:28.645
No, Carl, Carl, you and I just can't survive
our modern political life

01:45:28.739 --> 01:45:33.109
with these goddamn fellas down there
doing things the old way

01:45:33.202 --> 01:45:35.740
and eating them Negroes
for breakfast every morning.

01:45:35.830 --> 01:45:37.071
They got to quit that!

01:45:37.164 --> 01:45:41.829
Mr. President, you need to remove
these so-called "delegates at large."

01:45:41.919 --> 01:45:44.627
No, you listen to me!

01:45:44.713 --> 01:45:47.421
You need to make up your mind
once and for all

01:45:47.508 --> 01:45:49.591
what kind of Christian you are.

01:45:49.677 --> 01:45:54.388
Are you a once-a-week fella,
or do you hold the Word in your heart?

01:45:55.683 --> 01:45:57.720
<i>And what kind of politician are you?</i>

01:45:57.768 --> 01:46:00.306
<i>You just out for yourself,</i>

01:46:00.396 --> 01:46:03.810
<i>or you wanna make a better life
for all the people of Georgia?</i>

01:46:03.899 --> 01:46:06.312
- Well, of course I...
<i>- And what kind of man are you?</i>

01:46:06.902 --> 01:46:10.612
You got the balls to do
what you know is right,

01:46:10.698 --> 01:46:14.032
<i>or do you just slink away?</i>

01:46:14.118 --> 01:46:17.202
Now, what you don't get to do is threaten me.

01:46:17.288 --> 01:46:20.577
So if you're gonna walk out of the convention,
then you just do it right now!

01:46:20.624 --> 01:46:22.991
<i>But if not,</i>

01:46:23.085 --> 01:46:26.044
then I expect to see
your bright and shiny faces

01:46:26.130 --> 01:46:29.464
wearing your big
"All the way with LBJ" hats tonight

01:46:29.508 --> 01:46:31.215
when I take the stage.

01:46:38.225 --> 01:46:40.512
Bird, go away and leave me be.

01:46:40.603 --> 01:46:42.640
I can't do that, Lyndon.

01:46:42.730 --> 01:46:44.016
I won't.

01:46:45.357 --> 01:46:47.895
You're just like the rest of them.

01:46:47.985 --> 01:46:50.022
You're all against me.

01:46:50.112 --> 01:46:52.570
That is so not true.

01:46:52.656 --> 01:46:55.148
- Oh, yeah?
- Look at me.

01:46:56.160 --> 01:46:58.026
Look at me, Lyndon.

01:47:01.498 --> 01:47:07.836
You are as brave a man
as FDR and Truman and Lincoln.

01:47:08.672 --> 01:47:13.383
And there are many, many people
up there at that convention

01:47:13.469 --> 01:47:15.381
and in this party

01:47:15.471 --> 01:47:19.511
and in this nation who love you.

01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:23.514
- And they are counting on you.
- I'm gonna resign.

01:47:23.562 --> 01:47:25.599
- Let somebody else deal with this.
- You're not going to resign.

01:47:25.689 --> 01:47:27.305
- Yes, I am!
- No, you are not!

01:47:27.358 --> 01:47:31.728
When your great-grandmother
was hiding in the floorboards

01:47:31.820 --> 01:47:36.235
while the Comanches were raiding her house,
did she flinch?

01:47:36.867 --> 01:47:40.611
To step down now
would be wrong for your country.

01:47:40.704 --> 01:47:44.197
Your friends would be frozen
with embarrassment,

01:47:44.249 --> 01:47:45.865
and your enemies would jeer.

01:47:47.169 --> 01:47:49.877
Those bastards would love to see me down.

01:47:49.964 --> 01:47:51.796
And are you gonna give them that pleasure?

01:47:51.882 --> 01:47:54.249
I don't think so.

01:47:54.343 --> 01:47:56.630
That is not the man I married.

01:47:56.720 --> 01:47:58.962
Sir, Governor Sanders was just on TV,

01:47:59.056 --> 01:48:02.424
and the Georgia delegation's
not gonna walk out after all.

01:48:03.185 --> 01:48:06.394
- What, Sanders backed down?
- Yes, sir, he did.

01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:09.223
- So the South held?
- Yes, sir.

01:48:12.736 --> 01:48:14.443
<i>The honorable
Lyndon B. Johnson</i>

01:48:14.530 --> 01:48:16.442
<i>is nominated by acclamation</i>

01:48:16.532 --> 01:48:21.197
<i>as our candidate to the office
of President of the United States,</i>

01:48:21.245 --> 01:48:26.991
<i>and the honorable Hubert Horatio Humphrey
is our candidate for Vice President!</i>

01:48:27.084 --> 01:48:29.292
<i>The dust has settled here in Atlantic City,</i>

01:48:29.378 --> 01:48:33.918
<i>and President Johnson's Democratic Party
is one big, happy family.</i>

01:48:34.008 --> 01:48:36.250
Hello there!

01:48:37.761 --> 01:48:39.252
- Hubert.
- Mr. President.

01:48:39.346 --> 01:48:43.056
You look a little down in the mouth
for being the next vice president.

01:48:43.100 --> 01:48:46.514
It just feels different than I thought it would.

01:48:46.603 --> 01:48:48.560
Oh, that. Well...

01:48:48.605 --> 01:48:51.222
You get over that pretty quick.

01:48:51.275 --> 01:48:55.986
<i>The American people
have no greater advocate and friend</i>

01:48:56.071 --> 01:49:01.612
<i>than the man the Democratic Party
is proud to claim as our leader.</i>

01:49:01.702 --> 01:49:06.447
<i>Now the man of the hour,
Lyndon Baines Johnson!</i>

01:49:18.302 --> 01:49:22.512
We're down five points in Georgia,
six points in South Carolina,

01:49:22.598 --> 01:49:24.681
eight points in Louisiana.

01:49:24.767 --> 01:49:29.512
Hell, Goldwater is beating my ass
by 60% in Mississippi.

01:49:30.314 --> 01:49:32.055
Now, he's getting on top!

01:49:32.149 --> 01:49:34.641
Son of a bitch is turning it around!

01:49:35.152 --> 01:49:36.609
Where the hell are the ideas?

01:49:36.653 --> 01:49:38.269
Where the hell's the solutions?

01:49:39.156 --> 01:49:41.193
Walter, I want you to change
my travel schedule.

01:49:41.283 --> 01:49:44.321
Give me more time in the South,
especially Louisiana.

01:49:44.411 --> 01:49:45.401
And put more money into

01:49:45.496 --> 01:49:46.907
- our TV campaign down there.
- Yes, sir.

01:49:46.997 --> 01:49:50.161
And as for the rest of you,
what the hell are you still standing here for?

01:49:50.250 --> 01:49:51.991
Get out there and do something!

01:49:52.086 --> 01:49:53.167
Come on.

01:49:54.004 --> 01:49:56.041
Not you, Humphrey. Stay here.

01:49:56.131 --> 01:50:00.626
You read this bullshit <i>Wall Street Journal</i>
exposÃ© about my corruption?

01:50:00.677 --> 01:50:02.919
Definitely planted by Goldwater.

01:50:03.013 --> 01:50:04.675
Damn right it was.

01:50:04.765 --> 01:50:08.054
Take a look at this. Huh?

01:50:09.228 --> 01:50:11.185
That's disgusting.

01:50:11.271 --> 01:50:16.187
Goldwater wants to get down into the mud,
by God, I could do that.

01:50:16.276 --> 01:50:20.862
Listen here, I want you to pull together
a special group separate from the campaign

01:50:20.948 --> 01:50:22.814
and hit him back with everything we got!

01:50:22.866 --> 01:50:25.700
Mr. President, I don't think
sinking to their level is...

01:50:25.786 --> 01:50:28.244
Oh, for God's sake, just do it.

01:50:28.330 --> 01:50:32.950
Mr. President, you are ahead
in the polls in most of the country.

01:50:33.043 --> 01:50:35.831
Yeah, and so was Nixon in '60.

01:50:35.879 --> 01:50:38.292
And some people thought
he would've beat Jack

01:50:38.382 --> 01:50:42.376
except for a whole bunch of dead people
voting in Chicago at the last minute.

01:50:43.220 --> 01:50:46.338
It ain't over until it's over.

01:50:47.307 --> 01:50:50.050
<i>...eight, nine...</i>

01:50:52.396 --> 01:50:55.309
<i>- Nine...
- ...eight, seven,</i>

01:50:55.399 --> 01:50:57.311
<i>six, five,</i>

01:50:57.401 --> 01:50:59.984
<i>four, three,</i>

01:51:00.070 --> 01:51:02.562
<i>two, one,</i>

01:51:02.656 --> 01:51:04.067
<i>zero.</i>

01:51:07.161 --> 01:51:09.824
<i>These are the stakes</i>

01:51:09.913 --> 01:51:14.203
<i>to make a world in which
all of God's children can live</i>

01:51:14.918 --> 01:51:18.082
<i>or to go into the dark.</i>

01:51:18.172 --> 01:51:21.506
<i>We must either love each other,</i>

01:51:21.592 --> 01:51:24.050
<i>or we must die.</i>

01:51:24.094 --> 01:51:28.134
<i>Vote for President Johnson on November 3rd.</i>

01:51:28.223 --> 01:51:31.432
<i>The stakes are too high for you to stay home.</i>

01:51:35.147 --> 01:51:36.854
I want you to run this right away.

01:51:39.568 --> 01:51:41.776
It'll be controversial. You'll get a lot of flak.

01:51:41.862 --> 01:51:46.027
Then, we'll only have to run it once
and let the press do our work for us.

01:51:48.076 --> 01:51:50.113
I wanna see it again.

01:51:52.789 --> 01:51:56.248
<i>Now, Barry Goldwater says he's not a racist.</i>

01:51:56.293 --> 01:52:00.207
<i>But the government can't legislate
what people feel in their hearts.</i>

01:52:00.297 --> 01:52:02.289
- That's right!
<i>- And he's right.</i>

01:52:02.883 --> 01:52:05.717
<i>The law can't make white folks love you.</i>

01:52:05.802 --> 01:52:09.091
<i>But the law can prevent them
from lynching you.</i>

01:52:09.139 --> 01:52:10.129
Yes!

01:52:11.058 --> 01:52:14.972
<i>The law can prevent them
from denying you a job</i>

01:52:15.062 --> 01:52:16.644
<i>and your child an education.</i>

01:52:17.814 --> 01:52:21.307
<i>And the law can ensure
that you have the right to vote.</i>

01:52:21.401 --> 01:52:22.482
- Amen!
- Yes!

01:52:24.154 --> 01:52:28.569
<i>I'm not here today
to tell you fine people who to vote for.</i>

01:52:28.659 --> 01:52:30.525
<i>But come election day,</i>

01:52:30.619 --> 01:52:33.828
<i>let's be sure to send
the fine senator from Arizona</i>

01:52:33.914 --> 01:52:37.373
<i>and his tender heart
back to the desert where he belongs.</i>

01:52:43.257 --> 01:52:47.251
Walter was arrested?

01:52:47.344 --> 01:52:50.883
YMCA men's bathroom
by the D.C. Vice Squad.

01:52:50.973 --> 01:52:55.217
<i>The other man arrested
was an army staff sergeant.</i>

01:52:58.480 --> 01:53:00.346
No, no, no.

01:53:00.399 --> 01:53:02.641
- This must be some kind of mistake.
- No, sir.

01:53:03.694 --> 01:53:08.359
<i>Apparently, Walter was arrested
under similar circumstances five years ago.</i>

01:53:09.992 --> 01:53:11.733
Now, why didn't I know that?

01:53:11.827 --> 01:53:13.693
<i>None of us knew.</i>

01:53:13.829 --> 01:53:17.322
This has Goldwater's fingerprints all over it.

01:53:19.710 --> 01:53:21.997
Goldwater will use this.

01:53:22.045 --> 01:53:26.210
Goddamn, this close to the election,
it could be the whole ball of wax!

01:53:27.050 --> 01:53:31.044
There doesn't appear to be
any security compromise at all.

01:53:31.888 --> 01:53:34.596
There damn well better not be.

01:53:35.058 --> 01:53:37.516
Your people said they vetted him.

01:53:37.561 --> 01:53:40.304
I have it in writing
with your goddamn signature on it.

01:53:40.397 --> 01:53:44.141
- There are some things you can't predict.
- That's your job, Edgar.

01:53:44.234 --> 01:53:47.227
I will take care of this, Mr. President.

01:53:47.321 --> 01:53:50.985
And why don't that make me feel any better?

01:53:51.074 --> 01:53:54.317
<i>You get a hold of Walter's
Air Force Reserve records.</i>

01:53:54.411 --> 01:53:57.154
<i>Goldwater was his commanding officer.</i>

01:53:57.247 --> 01:54:00.240
<i>With any luck, he signed off
on his fitness evaluations.</i>

01:54:00.334 --> 01:54:04.123
<i>We get a hold of those,
and Goldwater won't be able to say shit!</i>

01:54:04.212 --> 01:54:06.329
<i>Walter will resign immediately.</i>

01:54:06.423 --> 01:54:08.756
<i>You see to it that his doctor
issues a statement.</i>

01:54:09.176 --> 01:54:12.294
Um, he was working too hard
and just snapped.

01:54:21.355 --> 01:54:25.065
I've been working with that man for 25 years

01:54:26.568 --> 01:54:28.776
and not a clue.

01:54:40.290 --> 01:54:44.625
How do you know when

01:54:46.213 --> 01:54:48.250
somebody's...

01:54:51.385 --> 01:54:55.470
Well, there's certain signs, mannerisms.

01:54:56.598 --> 01:55:00.308
The way a man dresses or combs his hair.

01:55:01.395 --> 01:55:03.432
Walks kind of funny.

01:55:06.233 --> 01:55:08.316
Well, that's news to me.

01:55:11.321 --> 01:55:13.358
I'm not questioning you.

01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:17.658
I'm sure you'd know.

01:55:21.164 --> 01:55:23.872
In your line of work, I mean.

01:55:26.420 --> 01:55:28.878
Marjorie is just beside herself.

01:55:28.964 --> 01:55:30.956
Can't believe it's true.

01:55:31.007 --> 01:55:33.044
I can't believe it's true.

01:55:33.135 --> 01:55:35.843
I am going to make
a public statement of support.

01:55:35.929 --> 01:55:37.670
Absolutely not.

01:55:38.432 --> 01:55:40.298
The First Lady can't be involved in this.

01:55:40.350 --> 01:55:41.932
None of us can be involved.

01:55:42.018 --> 01:55:43.850
Why, he's distraught, Lyndon.

01:55:43.937 --> 01:55:45.803
He could injure himself.

01:55:45.856 --> 01:55:47.597
That is not my problem.

01:55:47.691 --> 01:55:48.681
What...

01:55:49.818 --> 01:55:51.605
He is our friend.

01:55:51.695 --> 01:55:55.109
He was our friend,
and then he stabbed me in the back.

01:55:55.198 --> 01:55:57.736
What, are we just never gonna see him again?

01:55:57.826 --> 01:55:59.408
What, you think I like this?

01:55:59.494 --> 01:56:02.202
Now Goldwater's killing me in the polls.

01:56:07.878 --> 01:56:10.370
I loved Walter like a...

01:56:13.717 --> 01:56:18.007
I'm holding this campaign together
with baling wire and spit.

01:56:18.054 --> 01:56:20.671
And if you're not with me,
then you're against me.

01:56:20.724 --> 01:56:24.934
I know why
you think you have to do this, darling.

01:56:25.020 --> 01:56:28.058
But you're wrong. You do what you must.

01:56:28.148 --> 01:56:31.357
But I will not abandon our friend.

01:56:32.777 --> 01:56:37.067
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have speeches to deliver.

01:56:40.744 --> 01:56:42.451
God damn it.

01:56:50.003 --> 01:56:53.087
<i>In what is sure to be
a very controversial decision,</i>

01:56:53.173 --> 01:56:55.381
<i>the winner of this year's Nobel Prize for Peace</i>

01:56:55.425 --> 01:56:57.462
<i>is Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</i>

01:56:57.552 --> 01:57:02.593
<i>I am deeply moved and humbled
by the decision of the Nobel Committee</i>

01:57:02.682 --> 01:57:05.345
<i>who are devoted to the nonviolent pursuit</i>

01:57:05.435 --> 01:57:08.018
<i>of those rights
to which every man and woman...</i>

01:57:08.104 --> 01:57:11.142
How will you want to acknowledge Dr. King?

01:57:11.233 --> 01:57:13.065
I won't.

01:57:13.109 --> 01:57:15.522
King knows where I stand.

01:57:15.612 --> 01:57:18.605
I don't need to get on
the goddamn rooftops and shout it out.

01:57:18.657 --> 01:57:20.569
<i>...movement of many peoples</i>

01:57:20.617 --> 01:57:24.782
<i>who are devoted
to the nonviolent pursuit of those rights...</i>

01:57:24.871 --> 01:57:27.454
I'm supposed to have psychic abilities

01:57:27.541 --> 01:57:30.625
in order to protect the president
from deviants like Jenkins,

01:57:30.710 --> 01:57:33.623
but when it comes to King,
apparently no warning is strong enough.

01:57:33.713 --> 01:57:36.046
<i>...this award should be given
to the American civil rights...</i>

01:57:36.132 --> 01:57:39.466
Get me the sex tapes
of King with those women.

01:57:42.013 --> 01:57:43.299
And a typewriter.

01:57:46.768 --> 01:57:50.057
"King, you know you are a complete fraud

01:57:50.146 --> 01:57:54.937
"and a great liability to all of us Negroes."

01:57:55.986 --> 01:57:58.603
Sir, are you sure
the president will be comfortable with this?

01:57:58.655 --> 01:58:00.817
Doesn't matter.

01:58:02.367 --> 01:58:06.281
"King, you cannot believe in God.

01:58:06.329 --> 01:58:10.744
"Clearly you don't believe
in any moral principles.

01:58:10.834 --> 01:58:12.996
"You could have been our greatest leader,

01:58:13.086 --> 01:58:15.328
"but you turned out to be
nothing but a dissolute,

01:58:15.422 --> 01:58:17.960
"abnormal moral imbecile.

01:58:18.967 --> 01:58:23.962
"You are a colossal fraud,
and an evil, vicious one at that,

01:58:24.014 --> 01:58:28.509
"and you had better kill yourself
before your filthy, fraudulent soul

01:58:28.602 --> 01:58:31.470
<i>"is bared to the nation."</i>

01:58:44.618 --> 01:58:46.780
Goldwater! Goldwater!

01:58:46.870 --> 01:58:49.988
Goldwater! Goldwater!

01:58:50.040 --> 01:58:51.121
Goldwater! Goldwater!

01:58:51.207 --> 01:58:53.164
What the hell is wrong with these people?

01:58:53.209 --> 01:58:55.826
It's a Democratic rally, for Christ's sake!

01:58:55.879 --> 01:58:58.041
- Where's the governor?
- Left an hour ago.

01:58:58.131 --> 01:58:59.997
Suddenly called out of town.

01:59:00.050 --> 01:59:01.962
Cowardly son of a bitch.

01:59:02.052 --> 01:59:03.884
I've had enough of this horseshit.

01:59:03.970 --> 01:59:06.553
Let's get a move on. Move!

01:59:08.892 --> 01:59:14.388
<i>And now... Now let's give
a nice, warm New Orleans welcome</i>

01:59:14.481 --> 01:59:17.394
<i>to the President of the United States!</i>

01:59:24.866 --> 01:59:27.734
<i>All right. All right!</i>

01:59:27.827 --> 01:59:31.741
<i>You've had your say,
and now I'm gonna have mine.</i>

01:59:35.335 --> 01:59:39.329
<i>My fellow Southerners, please.</i>

01:59:39.422 --> 01:59:46.261
<i>I once got to know
this old senator from the South</i>

01:59:46.346 --> 01:59:49.555
<i>who lamented to me</i>

01:59:49.599 --> 01:59:52.433
<i>the condition of our beloved region.</i>

01:59:52.519 --> 01:59:59.187
<i>The old senator
talked about how outside forces</i>

01:59:59.275 --> 02:00:03.315
<i>divided and conquered
the people of the South</i>

02:00:03.405 --> 02:00:05.943
<i>by appealing to their racial hatred.</i>

02:00:06.032 --> 02:00:10.493
<i>I accept this award on behalf
of a civil rights movement</i>

02:00:10.578 --> 02:00:13.412
<i>which is working to establish</i>

02:00:13.456 --> 02:00:17.370
<i>a reign of freedom and a rule of justice.</i>

02:00:17.460 --> 02:00:20.669
<i>For only yesterday in Alabama,</i>

02:00:20.755 --> 02:00:24.419
<i>our children, crying out for brotherhood,</i>

02:00:24.467 --> 02:00:30.384
<i>were met with water hoses,
dogs, and even death.</i>

02:00:30.473 --> 02:00:33.966
<i>Now, the old senator described</i>

02:00:34.060 --> 02:00:37.679
<i>what a great future the South could have</i>

02:00:37.772 --> 02:00:40.389
<i>if only we'd all work together.</i>

02:00:40.483 --> 02:00:43.351
<i>Only yesterday in Mississippi,</i>

02:00:43.445 --> 02:00:47.314
<i>young people seeking the right to vote</i>

02:00:47.407 --> 02:00:51.242
<i>were brutalized and murdered.</i>

02:00:51.327 --> 02:00:55.992
<i>And the old senator talked longingly</i>

02:00:57.167 --> 02:01:01.662
<i>about going home one more time</i>

02:01:01.755 --> 02:01:05.123
<i>and telling people the truth.</i>

02:01:05.175 --> 02:01:11.172
<i>He said his poor state
hasn't heard the truth in 30 years.</i>

02:01:12.348 --> 02:01:16.592
<i>All we ever hear at election time</i>

02:01:16.686 --> 02:01:19.975
<i>is, "Nigger! Nigger! Nigger!"</i>

02:01:20.857 --> 02:01:24.146
<i>Well, I'm not gonna let them build up the hate.</i>

02:01:24.194 --> 02:01:30.486
<i>I'm not gonna let them trick my people
by appealing to their prejudice.</i>

02:01:30.533 --> 02:01:34.698
<i>I believe peoples everywhere</i>

02:01:34.788 --> 02:01:38.953
<i>can have dignity, equality,</i>

02:01:39.042 --> 02:01:40.829
<i>and freedom.</i>

02:01:40.877 --> 02:01:45.121
<i>We have a new law of the land.</i>

02:01:46.382 --> 02:01:48.715
<i>A civil rights law.</i>

02:01:50.220 --> 02:01:53.634
<i>And I'm gonna enforce it</i>

02:01:53.723 --> 02:01:57.262
<i>'cause it is the right thing to do!</i>

02:02:03.525 --> 02:02:08.111
ABC News
<i>continues its coverage of Election '64.</i>

02:02:08.196 --> 02:02:10.779
<i>President Johnson,
though he's doing extremely well</i>

02:02:10.865 --> 02:02:12.606
in winning and carrying states,

02:02:12.700 --> 02:02:15.067
has not yet reached
the position the polls gave him.

02:02:15.161 --> 02:02:17.153
The figures have just come in.

02:02:17.247 --> 02:02:20.490
Georgia, which has never
deserted the Democratic Party,

02:02:20.583 --> 02:02:22.666
has gone for Senator Goldwater.

02:02:22.752 --> 02:02:25.836
<i>Senator Goldwater so far
is doing respectably in the South,</i>

02:02:25.922 --> 02:02:29.211
so we'll just have to wait
to judge his basic strategy.

02:02:29.259 --> 02:02:32.423
<i>The polls are closing right now
in New York State.</i>

02:02:32.470 --> 02:02:35.679
<i>The</i> New York Herald Tribune
<i>put up the headline,</i>

02:02:35.765 --> 02:02:37.597
<i>"Johnson Landslide."</i>

<i>Lyndon Baines Johnson has been elected

02:02:48.611 --> 02:02:50.853
How about that? How about that?

02:02:50.947 --> 02:02:53.360
- Isn't that something?
- Oh, my God!

02:02:53.449 --> 02:02:57.739
- Where's Lady Bird?
- Right behind you, where I've always been.

02:02:58.037 --> 02:03:00.996
Oh. Sixty million votes.

02:03:01.624 --> 02:03:04.867
You're no accident, Mr. President.

02:03:06.337 --> 02:03:09.000
Mr. President, you've got a phone call
from Senator Russell.

02:03:09.090 --> 02:03:10.626
Well, all right!

02:03:10.717 --> 02:03:13.255
Well, go on, go on, have some fun!

02:03:15.722 --> 02:03:17.930
I'll be with you in a second.

02:03:19.309 --> 02:03:23.269
- Uncle Dick.
- Congratulations, Mr. President.

02:03:23.313 --> 02:03:27.182
<i>Well, I'm just trying to do
what the old master taught me</i>.

02:03:27.275 --> 02:03:30.359
You know none of this would've happened
without you, Uncle Dick, none of it.

02:03:30.445 --> 02:03:32.778
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

02:03:32.822 --> 02:03:34.905
My apologies about Georgia.

02:03:35.742 --> 02:03:37.859
Well, it was disappointing, yeah.

02:03:37.952 --> 02:03:43.038
Georgia has never voted Republican before,
not once.

02:03:43.124 --> 02:03:45.241
Not even during Reconstruction.

02:03:45.335 --> 02:03:47.577
<i>Well, they'll be back.</i>

02:03:51.215 --> 02:03:53.207
I sure wish you was here.

02:03:56.512 --> 02:03:58.253
<i>Listen, Uncle Dick,</i>

02:03:58.348 --> 02:04:00.510
<i>you know we got a hell
of a lot of work ahead of us.</i>

02:04:00.600 --> 02:04:03.013
<i>I'm counting on you, now.</i>

02:04:03.061 --> 02:04:05.348
I will give it all that I have, sir.

02:04:05.438 --> 02:04:07.304
I know you will.

02:04:07.357 --> 02:04:09.098
You enjoy your party, Mr. President.

02:04:09.192 --> 02:04:10.683
I'll see you in Washington.

02:04:23.164 --> 02:04:25.201
Congratulations, Mr. President.

02:04:25.249 --> 02:04:27.081
Yeah.

02:04:27.168 --> 02:04:29.455
My apologies.

02:04:31.130 --> 02:04:33.292
From our ambassador in Saigon.

02:04:37.345 --> 02:04:41.464
<i>A green light for Mr. Johnson,
a stop light for Senator Goldwater,</i>

02:04:41.557 --> 02:04:46.018
<i>and perhaps for the right wing
conservative control of the Republican Party.</i>

02:04:46.062 --> 02:04:48.270
<i>These are the numbers.</i>

02:04:48.356 --> 02:04:49.688
<i>In electoral votes, it is...</i>

02:04:49.732 --> 02:04:53.146
96% of the Negro vote to Johnson.

02:04:53.236 --> 02:04:54.898
They owe us big, Martin.

02:04:55.697 --> 02:04:57.734
Now they gotta give us that voting rights bill.

02:04:57.824 --> 02:05:00.282
Well, LBJ is not gonna give us anything.

02:05:00.368 --> 02:05:01.950
We've gotta take it.

02:05:02.036 --> 02:05:04.403
And we're gonna start
a new campaign right away

02:05:04.497 --> 02:05:06.113
in Alabama.

02:05:10.420 --> 02:05:14.084
I am so glad that it's finally over, aren't you?

02:05:14.173 --> 02:05:15.880
"Over"?

02:05:15.925 --> 02:05:17.837
It's just getting started.

02:05:17.927 --> 02:05:20.715
What are you doing out here by yourself?

02:05:20.763 --> 02:05:23.676
Everybody's waiting for you.
Come join the party.

02:05:23.766 --> 02:05:26.383
Your party. Mmm.

02:05:26.436 --> 02:05:27.927
In a minute.

02:05:37.613 --> 02:05:40.572
<i>You're goddamn right it's my party,</i>

02:05:40.616 --> 02:05:43.575
<i>and I had to drag it into the light</i>

02:05:43.619 --> 02:05:46.612
<i>kicking and screaming every inch of the way.</i>

02:05:46.706 --> 02:05:50.450
<i>'Cause this is how new things are born.</i>

02:05:51.753 --> 02:05:56.123
<i>Bird and I lost three babies
before we had Lynda,</i>

02:05:56.215 --> 02:05:59.799
<i>and I remember the moment
when they finally let me into the room</i>

02:05:59.886 --> 02:06:02.629
<i>to see my first live child.</i>

02:06:02.722 --> 02:06:04.679
<i>And there on the floor</i>

02:06:04.766 --> 02:06:09.761
<i>you could still see the doctor's footprints
in my wife's blood.</i>

02:06:09.812 --> 02:06:15.433
<i>And I thought, "Yeah, this is familiar.</i>

02:06:15.485 --> 02:06:18.353
<i>"I know this."</i>

02:06:18.446 --> 02:06:21.985
<i>But right now,
we're gonna party like there's no tomorrow</i>

02:06:22.075 --> 02:06:26.240
<i>'cause there's no feeling in the world
half as good as winning.</i>

02:06:27.413 --> 02:06:29.996
<i>But the sun will come up,</i>

02:06:30.083 --> 02:06:33.042
<i>and the knives will come out,</i>

02:06:33.127 --> 02:06:38.168
<i>and all these smiling faces
will be watching me,</i>

02:06:38.257 --> 02:06:42.092
<i>waiting for that
one first moment of weakness.</i>

02:06:42.178 --> 02:06:46.764
<i>And then they will gut me like a deer.</i>

02:06:46.849 --> 02:06:48.966
You okay, honey?

02:06:49.018 --> 02:06:51.180
I'm fine, Bird.

02:06:52.522 --> 02:06:54.684
<i>I'm great.</i>

02:06:54.774 --> 02:06:56.857
<i>Hell, I'm president.</i>
