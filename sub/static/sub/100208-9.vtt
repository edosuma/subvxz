10:57.352 --> 10:59.093
we ended up

10:59.136 --> 11:00.703
activating...

11:00.747 --> 11:02.879
a bunch of dead souls

11:02.923 --> 11:04.881
and, possibly...

11:04.925 --> 11:06.666
some evil spirits.

11:06.709 --> 11:09.059
What if this entity

11:09.103 --> 11:11.061
from the séance is the same one

11:11.105 --> 11:14.499
that I heard Gomber talking to
in the warehouse?

11:14.543 --> 11:17.546
Simon, when do I get
what was promised to me?

11:17.589 --> 11:20.549
[rumbling, deep voice]:
When I get what was promised.

11:20.592 --> 11:22.986
And what if it's back
because of us?

11:25.119 --> 11:27.164
He called the voice "Simon."

11:27.208 --> 11:31.603
How does a disembodied voice
kidnap a little girl?

11:31.647 --> 11:33.388
That voice was in
the warehouse in 2013.

11:33.431 --> 11:35.216
I have no idea
where it's been since then,

11:35.259 --> 11:37.174
but we got its attention
48 hours ago.

11:37.218 --> 11:40.090
That gave it enough time to
find a new human accomplice.

11:40.134 --> 11:43.354
Yesterday, that accomplice
found Ted here at The Claw.

11:43.398 --> 11:46.183
Bess, how many customers
did you serve yesterday

11:46.227 --> 11:47.402
while Ted was here?

11:47.445 --> 11:48.620
I don't know.

11:48.664 --> 11:50.884
Um, there was an older couple.

11:50.927 --> 11:55.192
There was a lady who only had
coffee but gave me a huge tip.

11:55.236 --> 11:56.585
Yeah. Tell me more about her.

11:56.628 --> 11:58.065
Um...

11:58.108 --> 11:59.544
she had a fresh manicure.

11:59.588 --> 12:01.024
Uh, deep mauve.

12:01.068 --> 12:03.635
That did not go with
the tattoo on her hand.

12:03.679 --> 12:04.593
Like, no.

12:10.947 --> 12:13.297
NANCY:
Did the tattoo

12:13.341 --> 12:14.472
look like this?

12:14.516 --> 12:15.473

12:16.779 --> 12:17.824
You're psychic.

12:17.867 --> 12:19.347
I'm not psychic.

12:21.349 --> 12:25.222
I saw this tattoo on Nathan
Gomber's hand this morning.

12:25.266 --> 12:26.571
NICK:
Bess' customer

12:26.615 --> 12:28.530
could be friends with Gomber.

12:28.573 --> 12:29.879
Someone who visits him
every week?

12:29.923 --> 12:31.489
Like the chief mentioned.
[Bess exhales]

12:31.533 --> 12:34.318
My big tipper was Moira Baker.

12:34.362 --> 12:36.494
She would've seen Ted
while she was at The Claw.

12:36.538 --> 12:37.844
Moira's
not just Gomber's friend.

12:39.280 --> 12:40.455
I think she's the new kidnapper.

12:47.288 --> 12:48.811
So, Moira took Ted

12:48.855 --> 12:51.814
and left Gomber's wax spiral
for everyone to find.

12:51.858 --> 12:54.469
But why has she taken Ted now?

12:54.512 --> 12:55.644
Because...

12:55.687 --> 12:57.341
Simon

12:57.385 --> 12:58.342
is back.

12:58.386 --> 12:59.779
Maybe he chose the victim

12:59.822 --> 13:02.433
he wanted after he
emerged from our séance.

13:02.477 --> 13:03.783
Now, Moira wants something
in return,

13:03.826 --> 13:06.002
some sort of reward from Simon.

13:06.046 --> 13:07.264
A reward?

13:07.308 --> 13:08.831
Like what? It's a deal with the devil,

13:08.875 --> 13:11.355
so money or... fame

13:11.399 --> 13:13.227
or her heart's greatest desire.

13:13.270 --> 13:14.837
Yeah, she wants Gomber
out of jail.

13:14.881 --> 13:16.056
Maybe that's her heart's desire.

13:16.099 --> 13:17.448
She could be in love with him.

13:17.492 --> 13:19.929
Ew. You know, people need
to have higher standards.

13:19.973 --> 13:21.626
D-Deal with the devil. Great.

13:21.670 --> 13:23.367
But where is she
keeping my sister?

13:23.411 --> 13:25.326
[phone buzzing]

13:27.502 --> 13:31.027
McGINNIS:
We got a search warrant
for Moira's apartment.

13:31.071 --> 13:34.378
This might be a letter
from Gomber.

13:35.858 --> 13:38.861
Does this cipher jog
any memories?

13:38.905 --> 13:42.082
Uh, I don't remember Gomber
having anything like that

13:42.125 --> 13:43.474
when I was with him.

13:43.518 --> 13:45.128
Yeah. Why is
his letter so tiny?

13:45.172 --> 13:46.260
It's called a kite.

13:46.303 --> 13:47.609
Prisoners pass 'em around.

13:47.652 --> 13:49.654
Gomber could've
slipped that to Moira

13:49.698 --> 13:51.091
when she visited yesterday.

13:51.134 --> 13:53.267
All right.
Thought I'd check.

13:53.310 --> 13:55.878
Tell Ms. Fan to sit tight.

13:55.922 --> 13:58.054
Could I see that?

13:58.098 --> 14:00.448
Nick, have you seen
a code like this before?

14:00.491 --> 14:01.884
Oh. Um, okay.

14:01.928 --> 14:03.364
F-Five letters.

14:03.407 --> 14:05.105
Bet you that spells "Moira."

14:05.148 --> 14:07.281
Okay. We got
to figure this out.

14:07.324 --> 14:08.891
I'm e-mailing this to my laptop.

14:08.935 --> 14:10.501
Yeah, we can spread the word
ourselves.

14:10.545 --> 14:13.765
Someone in this town
must've heard of Moira Baker.

14:13.809 --> 14:14.854
Uh, Nancy, wait.

14:16.638 --> 14:18.770
You're going
to Gomber's warehouse, right?

14:18.814 --> 14:21.338
I mean, haven't the police
already checked it out?

14:21.382 --> 14:23.340
They don't know where
the hidden staircase is.

14:23.384 --> 14:24.820
Yeah, okay, listen,

14:24.864 --> 14:27.475
it may not be so easy
for you to go back there.

14:27.518 --> 14:29.520
It's just an abandoned building.

14:29.564 --> 14:32.523
Yeah, where you experienced
something pretty intense.

14:32.567 --> 14:34.917
Look, trust me,
when-when you put yourself

14:34.961 --> 14:37.659
in the physical space
where that all went down,

14:37.702 --> 14:39.139
it's gonna have an impact.

14:39.182 --> 14:40.618
I could go with you.

14:40.662 --> 14:41.881
Why?

14:41.924 --> 14:43.230
You were there for me.

14:43.273 --> 14:45.885
When I was coming to
terms with my past.

14:45.928 --> 14:49.018
I thought maybe I could...

14:49.062 --> 14:50.628
do the same for you.

14:50.672 --> 14:52.804
You don't owe me anything.

14:52.848 --> 14:54.328
Especially now.

14:54.371 --> 14:55.938
Just because
we're not together anymore

14:55.982 --> 14:57.679
doesn't mean I don't care about

14:57.722 --> 14:59.420
what you're
going through. I'm not going through anything.

14:59.463 --> 15:01.639
Just trying to help find a missing kid.
Okay.

15:01.683 --> 15:03.685
And all I'm saying is
let me help.

15:03.728 --> 15:05.643
I think it's better
if I do it alone.

I didn't realize how much
testimony Nancy gave.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.001
It's amazing
how she handled that.

15:15.044 --> 15:15.915
CARSON:
Yeah.

15:15.958 --> 15:18.352
She was different after Gomber.

15:18.395 --> 15:22.704
It was like she put up a wall
between herself and the world.

15:22.747 --> 15:24.967
It was subtle, but it was there.

15:25.011 --> 15:28.884
Kate and I brought her
to a therapist to try and...

15:28.928 --> 15:30.016
help her talk
about what happened,

15:30.059 --> 15:32.366
but... Nancy
just kept saying

15:32.409 --> 15:34.977
she was fine.

across town right now.

I'll come with you.

16:14.799 --> 16:16.410

entering charge to your docket.

you go in there alone.

It's like my mind's blank.

17:10.855 --> 17:12.596
You know, if you'd stayed home,
I could've asked you

17:12.640 --> 17:14.250
to send me a picture
of the newspaper clipping

17:14.294 --> 17:15.817

The photo
about the Rose Turnbull case.

17:35.837 --> 17:38.231
Can you take a picture of it
and text it to me?

Okay, um, Gomber used
a substitution cipher.

some pretty crazy things.

19:03.098 --> 19:05.231

Simon requires
the soul of a child...

19:08.277 --> 19:09.496
as payment.

19:09.539 --> 19:12.238
We should tell Nancy about this.

19:12.281 --> 19:14.370
Yeah.

19:16.851 --> 19:20.811
I guess if I hadn't found Rose,

19:20.855 --> 19:23.162
he would have stabbed
her with a knife,

19:23.205 --> 19:25.686
as a means to delivering
her soul to Simon.

19:25.729 --> 19:28.341
But we still have
a couple hours of daylight left,

is somewhere else with Moira,

19:32.345 --> 19:33.737
that Moira feels safe.

Okay. We'll keep
looking for connections

19:36.262 --> 19:38.742
