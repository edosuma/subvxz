00:00.166 --> 00:02.836
Previously on <i>Awkward...</i>

00:03.711 --> 00:05.839
But you should know,
I didn't try to kill myself.

00:06.005 --> 00:07.548
"Jenna, as you are now,

00:07.673 --> 00:10.941
you could disappear, and
no one would notice. A friend."

00:11.219 --> 00:14.264
Guys like Matty
don't go for girls like us.

00:17.225 --> 00:18.549
[Bell rings]

00:21.053 --> 00:25.549
For 2.8 weeks, Matty
couldn't keep his hands off me.

00:27.373 --> 00:29.160
He was on a Jenna bender.

00:29.513 --> 00:31.741
And aside from the fact that
my vag-a-matic

00:31.866 --> 00:33.593
was suffering some serious road burn,

00:33.718 --> 00:35.644
I was high on life.

00:35.769 --> 00:38.085
I was living those
magical high school moments

00:38.210 --> 00:39.580
I'd only seen in movies,

00:39.705 --> 00:42.984
and like most leading ladies,
I wanted more.

00:43.109 --> 00:44.852
Not more boning.

00:44.977 --> 00:47.355
I wasn't starting a lifelong
battle with sex addiction.

00:47.480 --> 00:51.343
I just wanted more...
Intimacy.

00:51.509 --> 00:53.328
Like the kind I had
with Brian Palermo

00:53.453 --> 00:55.263
when we played doctor as kids.

00:55.429 --> 00:56.597
Ah, there's a cramp.
I got to--

00:56.722 --> 00:57.732
Sorry.

00:57.857 --> 00:59.434
Seven years later,
I was playing for real

00:59.559 --> 01:01.502
with a guy I knew nothing about.

01:01.627 --> 01:05.573
Oh. Can you move?
My head's in the oven.

01:05.698 --> 01:07.241
- Yeah.
- My casual suicide reference

01:07.366 --> 01:08.743
could have killed the moment,

01:08.868 --> 01:10.244
but luckily Matty was preoccupied.

01:10.369 --> 01:11.905
Oh, God.

01:12.071 --> 01:13.715
Oh, uh, should I wait?

01:13.840 --> 01:15.450
It was time to get to know Matty.

01:15.741 --> 01:16.718
Oh.

01:16.843 --> 01:18.319
And I had approximately ten seconds.

01:18.444 --> 01:19.687
If you could live
anywhere in the world,

01:19.812 --> 01:21.415
- where would it be?
- Uh, I don't know.

01:21.581 --> 01:23.124
How old were you
when you lost your virginity?

01:23.249 --> 01:24.392
'Bout 15.

01:24.517 --> 01:25.693
Okay, so if you were on death row,

01:25.818 --> 01:27.462
what would you want
as your last meal?

01:27.587 --> 01:28.696
- Oh, benihana's.
- Are you close to your mom?

01:28.963 --> 01:31.133
- Okay, no more questions.
- Okay.

01:31.299 --> 01:34.702
Awesome!

01:34.827 --> 01:36.270
[Sighs]

01:36.596 --> 01:38.140
Wow.

01:39.765 --> 01:40.708
Oh, hey.

01:40.833 --> 01:45.413
I used to collect these little dudes.

01:45.538 --> 01:47.582
Turns out we had a lot in common.

01:47.707 --> 01:48.383
Keep it.

01:48.508 --> 01:49.884
So after bonding over sex

01:50.009 --> 01:52.863
and our shared love of reptiles
trained in martial arts

01:53.079 --> 01:54.389
specializing in sabotage,

01:54.514 --> 01:56.724
I couldn't help but wonder

01:56.849 --> 01:59.369
if this made Matty and I a "We,"

01:59.535 --> 02:01.696
and were we going
about this backwards?

02:01.821 --> 02:04.365
First the sex, then the relationship?

02:04.490 --> 02:07.034
Or were we just more interesting?

02:07.159 --> 02:08.369
Do we have any plans--

02:08.494 --> 02:11.205
do you. Do you have
any plans this weekend?

02:11.330 --> 02:14.208
I'll, uh, probably swing by
Lissa's party Friday.

02:14.333 --> 02:15.410
Oh.

02:15.535 --> 02:17.311
I should have gone with the "We."

02:17.436 --> 02:19.046
You know, power of suggestion.

02:19.171 --> 02:22.640
You should come.

02:27.345 --> 02:31.315
Okay, so I guess "we" weren't
the type who kissed good-bye.

02:36.488 --> 02:38.116
Or maybe we were.

02:41.561 --> 02:43.671
[Typing on keyboard]

02:43.796 --> 02:45.290
[Loud thud]

02:47.332 --> 02:48.910
If you're not busy tonight,

02:49.035 --> 02:52.180
Ricky Schwartz is having peeps
over for strip jenga.

02:52.305 --> 02:55.016
Um, Matty invited me to a party.

02:55.141 --> 02:57.351
Get out of the city!

02:57.476 --> 02:59.487
Matty's actual words,
"You should come."

02:59.612 --> 03:01.022
Does that count as an invite?

03:01.147 --> 03:03.124
He parked his pink Cadillac
down your side street.

03:03.249 --> 03:04.525
Of course it counts.

03:04.650 --> 03:06.794
He's taking you public,
outing you as a couple.

03:06.919 --> 03:08.963
Tamara thought
Matty and I were a "We."

03:09.088 --> 03:10.364
So it's a date?

03:10.489 --> 03:11.999
Dates are so old testament.

03:12.124 --> 03:13.100
You just show up at the party.

03:13.225 --> 03:14.435
And bring me.

03:14.560 --> 03:16.070
Well, too bad it's being thrown

03:16.195 --> 03:17.638
by queen of the virgin parade.

03:17.763 --> 03:20.775
Join the abstinence club.
Before it's too late.

03:20.900 --> 03:22.276
Tia.

03:22.401 --> 03:24.512
It means this is awkward.

03:24.637 --> 03:29.684
Abstinence isn't easy,
and neither are you.

03:29.809 --> 03:31.118
Guess you can't be in that club.

03:31.243 --> 03:32.320
But you can still go to her party.

03:32.445 --> 03:33.855
It's penciled in.

03:33.980 --> 03:35.923
Keeping Matty and I's
relationship off the grid

03:36.048 --> 03:37.481
seems to be working for us.

03:43.288 --> 03:44.165
Hey, stop.

03:44.290 --> 03:45.333
Don't touch me there.

03:45.458 --> 03:48.269
That, sir, is my no-no square.

03:48.394 --> 03:49.670
Girlfriend's on the hymen squad.

03:49.795 --> 03:52.106
Yeah. Lissa's given me
so many rub and tugs,

03:52.231 --> 03:53.808
I got no skin left down there.

03:53.933 --> 03:55.176
I blame God.

03:55.301 --> 03:56.577
You know what really sucks, man?

03:56.861 --> 03:58.312
It's our three-month
anniversary tonight,

03:58.437 --> 03:59.647
so I'm probably due another handie.

03:59.772 --> 04:01.482
- Or Lissa's case, a sandie.
- Huh?

04:01.607 --> 04:04.085
Handie so rough, it's like sandpaper.

04:04.210 --> 04:05.419
We have to go to Lissa's.

04:05.544 --> 04:07.388
This is my opportunity to skip nine,

04:07.513 --> 04:09.423
maybe ten rungs on the social ladder.

04:09.548 --> 04:10.825
It's probably gonna be a big party,

04:10.950 --> 04:12.377
and no one'll
even notice we're there.

04:12.543 --> 04:13.895
Doesn't matter.

04:14.020 --> 04:15.547
A person's popularity
is directly related

04:15.713 --> 04:17.673
to the number of red cup pics
they have posted online.

04:17.839 --> 04:19.466
Photoshopping my way to the a-list

04:19.632 --> 04:21.469
was a big fail Mary.

04:21.594 --> 04:23.337
To simulate gange smoke,
I lit a fire in my trash can,

04:23.462 --> 04:24.872
and my hair caught on fire.

04:24.997 --> 04:27.174
Luckily, I was wearing
my Jessica Simps' bump-up pony,

04:27.299 --> 04:28.743
so I just ripped that [Bleep] Out.

04:28.868 --> 04:30.177
S-t-o-p.

04:30.302 --> 04:33.748
Keep your thing away from me.

04:33.873 --> 04:36.651
Where's your purity ring?
Hanging from your nipple?

04:36.776 --> 04:38.686
I'm just using the gifts God gave me.

04:38.811 --> 04:41.355
I hope you're using the party
planning gifts he gave you,

04:41.480 --> 04:43.090
because I will not be associated

04:43.215 --> 04:45.192
with some lame-ass shindy.

04:45.317 --> 04:47.128
Especially when tonight's the night

04:47.253 --> 04:51.299
I'm hooking up with Matty.

04:51.424 --> 04:53.876
My party is going
to rock your face off.

04:54.001 --> 04:55.836
And it's perfect timing.

04:55.961 --> 04:58.389
It's mine and Jake's
three-month anniversary.

04:58.514 --> 04:59.966
You know what that means, right?

05:00.132 --> 05:02.927
It's our paper anniversary?

05:03.052 --> 05:05.388
More like a latex anniversary.

05:05.513 --> 05:08.642
'Cause it's the deadline for sex.

05:08.808 --> 05:11.352
If you don't do him, you'll lose him.

05:11.477 --> 05:13.485
Oh, and do not heat up the hot tub.

05:13.610 --> 05:15.109
I can't have it going down with Matty

05:15.234 --> 05:17.325
in some nasty cesspool.

05:22.029 --> 05:23.698
Maybe we should go tonight.

05:23.823 --> 05:26.701
I was having
some serious party jitters.

05:26.826 --> 05:30.471
My outfit said yes, but my gut
said stay the hell home.

05:30.596 --> 05:33.608
Maybe it was a sign that Matty
needed room to miss me.

05:33.733 --> 05:36.544
I just decided we're not going.

05:36.669 --> 05:38.667
If we don't go,
then the terrorists win.

05:38.792 --> 05:40.693
And by "terrorists" I mean Sadie.

05:40.818 --> 05:42.724
I can't believe you never
showed this to me.

05:42.849 --> 05:44.302
Bitch definitely wrote the letter.

05:44.668 --> 05:45.686
Why would she bother?

05:45.811 --> 05:47.154
One, she hates you,

05:47.279 --> 05:49.857
two, she sexted your billabongs
to the tri-school area,

05:49.982 --> 05:51.559
and, three,
she has a thing for Matty,

05:51.684 --> 05:53.194
and probably suspects you do too.

05:53.319 --> 05:54.762
You cannot show fear.

05:54.887 --> 05:56.263
You have to show her
you don't give a crap.

05:56.388 --> 05:58.199
Or I don't go,
and I don't show anything.

05:58.324 --> 06:00.267
Laundry.

06:00.392 --> 06:04.104
Um, are you wearing eyeliner?

06:04.229 --> 06:05.439
What's happening here?

06:05.564 --> 06:07.074
She got invited to an in-crowd party,

06:07.199 --> 06:08.709
but she doesn't want to go.

06:08.834 --> 06:12.479
Oh, you're going, and I know
exactly what you could wear.

06:12.604 --> 06:14.849
Nothing in your closet.
Be right back.

06:14.974 --> 06:17.493
What if you invited Matty to
a party and he didn't show up?

06:17.659 --> 06:18.652
How would you feel?

06:18.777 --> 06:20.154
Well, I'd be bummed.

06:20.279 --> 06:22.756
Guys have feelings too.
They're sensitive.

06:22.881 --> 06:24.458
Especially if they're circumcised.

06:24.583 --> 06:25.826
Matty junior wear a helmet?

06:25.951 --> 06:29.163
- How would I know?
- Oh, you'd know.

06:29.288 --> 06:30.698
Both: No.

06:30.823 --> 06:32.717
Okay, well,
I don't want Matty to feel bad,

06:32.883 --> 06:34.902
so, I don't know,
should I ask him to walk me in,

06:35.027 --> 06:36.470
or does that make me
seem like a pussy?

06:36.595 --> 06:38.305
No, you and Matty have a thing.

06:38.430 --> 06:39.974
I didn't know what kind of thing,

06:40.099 --> 06:43.143
but I was hoping the party
would clear that up.

06:43.268 --> 06:44.745
Both: No.

06:44.870 --> 06:46.689
Okay.

06:46.905 --> 06:49.750
Big ups on the content, but
I'm not sold on the sign off.

06:49.875 --> 06:52.620
Yeah. I tried an exclaim,
but it made me seem too excited,

06:52.745 --> 06:54.288
and now I'm worried
the dot dot dot is too whorey.

06:54.413 --> 06:57.358
Agreed. The ellipses
are the sluts of punctuation.

06:57.483 --> 06:59.593
Go with a dash.

06:59.718 --> 07:01.929
Both: No.

07:02.054 --> 07:05.733
I don't really remember
a whole hell of a lot

07:05.858 --> 07:06.901
from that night.

07:07.167 --> 07:09.303
Keep in mind,
it was my very first party,

07:09.428 --> 07:12.306
and I was <i>wasted.</i>

07:12.431 --> 07:15.576
And I was alone
with maybe seven guys,

07:15.701 --> 07:17.178
and they were wasted...

07:17.436 --> 07:20.381
Okay. If you're about to get
nostalgic over your first orgy,

07:20.506 --> 07:22.583
I really don't want to hear about it.

07:22.708 --> 07:25.552
Surprisingly, no.

07:25.677 --> 07:28.314
But I never did find out
what happened to my panties.

07:28.480 --> 07:30.624
Okay, um...

07:30.749 --> 07:32.293
He hasn't texted me back.

07:32.418 --> 07:34.728
How do I know if he's inside?
Or should I wait out here?

07:34.853 --> 07:36.530
- Who are we talking about?
- Matty McKibben.

07:36.655 --> 07:39.233
[Gasps] Are you and Matty together?

07:39.358 --> 07:42.369
Apparently this was a burning
question on everyone's mind.

07:42.494 --> 07:44.238
If only I could answer it.

07:44.363 --> 07:46.507
Can we go around the block again?

07:46.632 --> 07:50.010
No more laps.
Mm-mm.

07:50.135 --> 07:51.745
The beer is for the kids.

07:51.870 --> 07:53.614
Finnish vodka is for Lissa's mom.

07:53.739 --> 07:55.115
She is a big boozer,

07:55.240 --> 07:58.469
and no doubt drank every
ounce of hooch in that house.

07:58.635 --> 08:00.988
All right, girls.
What is the golden rule?

08:01.113 --> 08:03.357
Both: Beer before liquor,
never sicker.

08:03.482 --> 08:05.592
Liquor before beer, in the clear.

08:05.717 --> 08:08.262
Yay!
Have a good night.

08:08.387 --> 08:11.298
Mwah.

08:11.423 --> 08:12.499
Promise me if it's weird at all

08:12.624 --> 08:13.867
that we will just leave, okay?

08:13.992 --> 08:15.536
Like you said,
no one'll even notice us.

08:15.661 --> 08:16.937
It sounds like a rager.

08:17.062 --> 08:19.006
There's probably
five million people in here.

08:19.131 --> 08:23.077
That's true, I guess.

08:23.202 --> 08:26.213
Hi.

08:26.338 --> 08:27.915
Or we just crashed a get-together.

08:28.040 --> 08:29.940
Tia.

08:36.607 --> 08:39.594
Uh, the Finnish vodka's for your mom,

08:39.760 --> 08:43.457
and the beer is...
That's for us.

08:43.582 --> 08:45.592
Oh, my mom'll be so stoked.

08:45.717 --> 08:48.353
Her bathroom mini fridge
is totally empty.

08:48.587 --> 08:50.633
Who... the fuck...

08:50.758 --> 08:52.782
invited... you?

08:54.311 --> 08:55.568
I did.

08:57.097 --> 08:58.752
Matty and I were a "we."

09:01.612 --> 09:03.334
Better hide the knives.

09:04.571 --> 09:05.920
Say "Sadie!"

09:06.211 --> 09:08.256
Get out of my face, wannabe.

09:08.381 --> 09:08.981
[Dog barkles]

09:09.106 --> 09:13.387
Lissa, I told you to lock up
that stupid mutt!

09:13.512 --> 09:15.522
Sprinkles, be quiet!

09:15.647 --> 09:18.132
So there we were, out in public,

09:18.298 --> 09:20.969
for the whole...
Small group of people to see.

09:21.094 --> 09:23.004
I wondered how he'd introduce me.

09:23.129 --> 09:24.606
Hey.

09:24.772 --> 09:28.309
As his girlfriend,
his date, his <i>lover...</i>

09:28.560 --> 09:30.195
Drinks and stuff are over here.

09:30.361 --> 09:32.072
I would have settled for "Jenna."

09:32.197 --> 09:34.240
Well, you know everybody.

09:37.743 --> 09:39.704
Hey, McKibben.

09:40.205 --> 09:42.649
I know almost no one.

09:42.774 --> 09:44.551
- What do we do now?
- Blend in.

09:44.676 --> 09:45.986
There's nothing to blend into.

09:46.111 --> 09:47.588
Matty invited you here.

09:47.713 --> 09:49.590
It's your turn to make the next move.

09:49.715 --> 09:53.793
But first, pretend
like you're cross-faded.

09:56.053 --> 09:57.972
Cigarette butts.

10:05.796 --> 10:08.399
- How's it going?
- Good.

10:08.524 --> 10:10.360
Yeah, good.

10:10.526 --> 10:12.403
Pretty good.

10:14.139 --> 10:15.531
Okay, actually, it's kind of weird.

10:15.697 --> 10:17.479
- Oh, it's way weird.
- Yes.

10:17.604 --> 10:18.936
Listen, I really didn't know

10:19.061 --> 10:20.420
this was gonna be a kickback.

10:20.545 --> 10:21.922
- I figured.
- Yeah.

10:22.047 --> 10:24.707
Oh, let me ask you something.

10:24.873 --> 10:26.894
What's the benefit
to having a smaller party

10:27.019 --> 10:29.260
versus a, um, standard rager?

10:29.385 --> 10:31.381
Well, no one's gonna call the cops,

10:31.547 --> 10:33.841
and their house won't get trashed.

10:33.992 --> 10:37.871
And there's a lot more booze
to go around, so...

10:37.996 --> 10:41.475
It's really nice
to see you out, Jenna.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.394
Is this your first party
since the accident?

10:44.560 --> 10:46.363
Everybody smize.

10:46.488 --> 10:48.940
Smile with your eyes.

10:49.555 --> 10:50.557
If our body language

10:50.682 --> 10:53.121
was analyzed by the experts
at <i>Us Weekly,</i>

10:53.246 --> 10:55.613
they would have said
we were on the outs.

10:55.946 --> 10:58.025
Matty, I need your help with the keg.

10:58.150 --> 10:59.960
Right.
Uh, talk later?

11:03.120 --> 11:04.903
Hey, did you get lowlights?

11:05.028 --> 11:06.207
And highlights.

11:06.373 --> 11:09.094
Then I got completely
neck-2-t lasered.

11:09.219 --> 11:10.304
Did it hurt?

11:10.429 --> 11:11.754
I didn't even feel it.

11:11.920 --> 11:13.307
Then again, I always take, like,

11:13.432 --> 11:14.299
three zannies.

11:14.465 --> 11:15.629
Oh, my God.
Is that safe?

11:15.754 --> 11:17.397
They're driving zannies.

11:17.522 --> 11:19.267
Cups up, ladies.

11:21.062 --> 11:22.916
By the way, I'm Tamara.

11:23.041 --> 11:26.260
It's spelled "tam-ara,"
but it's pronounced "ta-mara."

11:26.478 --> 11:28.388
Like, if your birth control fails,

11:28.513 --> 11:31.516
you better plan "b" it "ta-mara."

11:36.687 --> 11:39.780
Wow. I've never actually
seen a girl eat

11:39.905 --> 11:40.972
at one of these kickbacks.

11:41.097 --> 11:43.411
You look like you're having
about as much fun as I am.

11:43.577 --> 11:45.939
I'm a little stressed.
It's my anniversary.

11:46.064 --> 11:48.082
Well, it makes sense.
A year's a long time.

11:48.448 --> 11:50.993
It's only been three months.

11:58.042 --> 11:59.418
Wha--

12:04.782 --> 12:07.101
Liss.
People are watching.

12:07.619 --> 12:09.645
- What people?
- Okay.

12:12.623 --> 12:14.267
Where have you been?

12:14.392 --> 12:15.936
I had to take a leak.

12:16.061 --> 12:17.404
Oh.
Well, come check this out.

12:17.529 --> 12:19.739
Lissa's dad got an electric eel,

12:19.905 --> 12:21.775
and when you tap the glass,
it gets super pissed,

12:21.900 --> 12:23.701
and shocks the crap
out of the angel fish.

12:23.867 --> 12:26.847
Sadie, let's just talk
about it a little later, okay?

12:26.972 --> 12:28.337
All right.

12:33.444 --> 12:35.122
Don't even talk to me

12:35.247 --> 12:39.384
until you kick that slut-hole
out of your party.

12:39.509 --> 12:40.727
Why?

12:40.852 --> 12:42.863
[Gasps] Did Matty just blow you off?

12:42.988 --> 12:44.364
No, I asked him to get me a beer.

12:44.489 --> 12:46.099
What is your problem, drunk fu?

12:46.465 --> 12:48.135
You were right about Jake.

12:48.350 --> 12:51.312
He is pulling away.
I have to step it up.

12:51.897 --> 12:53.607
But I can't have sex-sex,

12:53.732 --> 12:57.527
so what can I do
without breaking my vow?

12:57.693 --> 13:00.247
Well, there is a loophole.

13:00.372 --> 13:02.349
Really?

13:02.474 --> 13:06.160
God has a blind spot.

13:06.344 --> 13:08.621
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:10.628 --> 13:14.161
So I was thinking,
you remember the other day

13:14.286 --> 13:16.396
when we were at your house,
and we were talking--

13:16.521 --> 13:18.932
What's going on, man?

13:19.057 --> 13:21.717
So there we were, not speaking.

13:22.272 --> 13:24.676
I desperately wanted him
to say something.

13:24.801 --> 13:25.572
Anything.

13:25.697 --> 13:27.574
Even though I was stuck on mute.

13:27.699 --> 13:30.811
24 hours ago,
Matty was taking my temp

13:30.936 --> 13:32.094
with his all-beef thermometer,

13:32.260 --> 13:33.480
and now he couldn't even ask me

13:33.605 --> 13:35.749
how much foam I wanted.

13:35.874 --> 13:37.984
Oh, oh.
That's--that's plenty.

13:38.150 --> 13:39.553
Maybe he was just shy.

13:39.678 --> 13:41.755
I mean, I'd never
been out with him before.

13:41.880 --> 13:44.591
For all I know,
he had social anxiety.

13:44.716 --> 13:48.228
Who's ready for some hot tub action?

13:48.353 --> 13:50.931
[All cheer] Whoo!

13:51.056 --> 13:54.617
So my shy theory was a tad off.

13:54.783 --> 13:57.420
Whoo!

13:58.663 --> 14:00.540
I told you no hot tub.

14:00.665 --> 14:03.443
I needed an excuse to get in a bikini

14:03.568 --> 14:05.135
so I could lure Jake into my room.

14:05.260 --> 14:08.348
But don't worry.
I know you don't do swimsuits,

14:08.473 --> 14:12.319
so I brought you
one of my dad's shirts.

14:12.444 --> 14:14.896
Where's Jake?

14:18.716 --> 14:20.093
Lose the clothes, beer wench.

14:20.218 --> 14:21.094
We're going in.

14:21.219 --> 14:23.946
I think I'll pass.

14:29.311 --> 14:30.822
I only missed the concert

14:30.947 --> 14:32.738
'cause I had to go
to my parents' divorce party.

14:32.982 --> 14:33.658
Boo.

14:33.783 --> 14:34.993
But get another drink in me

14:35.118 --> 14:37.395
and I can make music in your pants.

14:37.520 --> 14:38.530
Hello?

14:38.655 --> 14:39.998
It was a career low.

14:40.123 --> 14:41.966
I had resorted
to the fake phone call.

14:42.091 --> 14:45.136
Oh, I'm just chillin'
at this kickback.

14:45.261 --> 14:47.005
I was putting up
with a bunch of ass-icles

14:47.130 --> 14:50.828
just to hang with Matty,
who had barely acknowledged me.

14:50.953 --> 14:52.897
I guess the all-encompassing "we"

14:53.022 --> 14:55.480
I was hoping for wasn't
the "we" that he wanted.

14:55.605 --> 14:59.173
Oh, no, karaoke sounds awesome.

15:03.412 --> 15:05.056
Happy anniversary.

15:05.181 --> 15:06.105
Whoa.
Unh.

15:06.382 --> 15:09.861
- [Laughs]
- Jeez, Liss.

15:09.986 --> 15:12.463
- It's been three months.
- Mm-hmm.

15:12.588 --> 15:16.334
And I want to reward you

15:16.459 --> 15:18.636
for being so patient.

15:18.761 --> 15:22.840
Oh.
I don't need a reward.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.075
Whoa.

15:24.200 --> 15:28.252
I can't give you
exactly what you want...

15:28.418 --> 15:30.014
Uh-huh.

15:30.139 --> 15:33.384
But I can give you...

15:33.509 --> 15:36.454
My be-hymen!

15:36.579 --> 15:41.015
Jake, can you--
can you help me with this?

15:41.284 --> 15:44.552
Jake? Jake?

15:47.322 --> 15:48.600
[Knock at door]

15:48.725 --> 15:49.801
Just a second.

15:49.926 --> 15:54.653
Jenna, are you playing video games?

15:54.819 --> 15:57.308
Okay, look, this clearly
wasn't a real invite.

15:57.433 --> 15:58.666
You have enough pictures,

15:58.832 --> 15:59.959
so can we please just go?

16:00.125 --> 16:01.446
Two skanks are all over Matty,

16:01.571 --> 16:02.947
but he hit the ignore button.

16:03.072 --> 16:05.080
Probably because he's waiting
for some Hamilton soup.

16:05.246 --> 16:06.918
Really?

16:07.043 --> 16:09.387
[Dramatic music]

16:09.512 --> 16:11.089
Tamara was right.

16:11.214 --> 16:12.690
Matty wasn't responsive.

16:12.815 --> 16:16.060
Even though sluts-her-face
was practically dry-humping him.

16:16.185 --> 16:17.629
Ow.

16:17.754 --> 16:18.630
I did want to go in.

16:18.755 --> 16:20.031
And what did I have to lose?

16:20.303 --> 16:22.139
I had some Victoria's
secrets of my own.

16:27.130 --> 16:29.507
I didn't know if
he was going out of his way

16:29.632 --> 16:30.875
to answer my question,

16:31.000 --> 16:33.645
but he couldn't
have made it any clearer.

16:33.770 --> 16:35.680
Matty and I weren't a "we" at all.

16:35.805 --> 16:37.982
There was only me, and...

16:38.107 --> 16:40.674
Me was devastated.

What are you looking at, freak?

16:55.097 --> 16:56.073
Nothin

16:56.198 --> 16:58.008
looks like Matty
invited a lot of people.

16:58.174 --> 17:00.077
I'm not in the mood for a sob fest,

17:00.202 --> 17:04.138
so why don't you go home
and practice the blood violin?

17:06.473 --> 17:07.984
Yeah.
I'm sorry.

17:08.109 --> 17:09.553
Oh, you want to take this inside?

17:09.678 --> 17:13.232
No. Just back off, please?

17:13.397 --> 17:14.959
Okay, I want to go, "t."

17:15.084 --> 17:17.795
But I need her
to hold up my extensions.

It's a little serendip... Itous
that I'm gonna vomit,

17:25.728 --> 17:27.637
because now I don't
have to feel guilty

17:27.762 --> 17:29.607
about eating all those nachos.

Oh, please don't tell me you
want me to pick you up already.

Um, no, I was actually, um,

calling because the party's
so awesome, we might be a while.

to piss your pants,

18:55.625 --> 18:57.470
I was just thinking the same thing.

19:00.221 --> 19:02.016
So why did you bail on the party?

19:02.382 --> 19:04.393
'Cause, um...

19:07.628 --> 19:09.106
It sucked.

the part of the story

19:12.970 --> 19:14.445

known each other longer, and...

19:29.785 --> 19:31.061
Does that make any sense?

19:31.186 --> 19:33.097
I knew exactly what he meant.

19:33.222 --> 19:35.299
Not that I wanted
to take it up with kardashian.

19:35.424 --> 19:38.035
But maybe Matty and I
shouldn't have done anything

19:38.160 --> 19:39.803
until we knew each other better.

19:39.928 --> 19:42.631
Man. Everything on
the radio's really depressing.

19:42.797 --> 19:44.408

spent any time with Jake,

19:44.533 --> 19:47.311

intimate stuff about him.

really want to know.
