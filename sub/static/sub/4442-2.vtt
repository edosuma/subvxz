00:11.536 --> 00:13.804
Here's us playing roulette
in the casino.

00:13.872 --> 00:16.039
And here's us
doing karaoke.

00:16.107 --> 00:18.320
And here's us...
Oh, gross, Drew.

00:18.440 --> 00:19.707
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:19.774 --> 00:21.709
He must have taken that
when he was drunk.

00:21.776 --> 00:24.244
Okay, here's some dolphins
off the ship.

00:24.312 --> 00:25.745
Looks like a fun cruise.

00:25.813 --> 00:27.981
Yeah, Mexico was a blast.

00:28.048 --> 00:29.415
Thanks again
for watching Wilfred.

00:29.483 --> 00:30.383
Yeah.

00:30.451 --> 00:31.411
By the way, how are you?

00:31.476 --> 00:34.087
I feel like we haven't really
talked since the wedding.

00:34.155 --> 00:35.188
I'm good.

00:35.256 --> 00:36.322
We heard about
the whole Amanda thing.

00:36.390 --> 00:37.457
Are you okay?

00:37.525 --> 00:39.025
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:39.093 --> 00:40.861
I want you to know that
I'm always here for you.

00:40.928 --> 00:42.963
I appreciate that.

00:43.030 --> 00:44.798
And here's me

00:44.865 --> 00:46.633
looking out the window
at absolutely nothing.

00:46.700 --> 00:49.034
I did that for, like,
four or five hours.

00:49.102 --> 00:50.402
And here's me right after

00:50.470 --> 00:52.238
I startled myself awake
with my own fart.

00:52.305 --> 00:55.188
And here's me...
Oh, gross, Wilfred.

00:55.437 --> 00:58.005
Sorry, I must've taken
that when I was drunk.

00:58.073 --> 01:00.040
Wilfred sure is
excited to see us.

01:00.108 --> 01:03.411
I think that this is the longest
we've ever been away from him.

01:03.479 --> 01:05.245
Hey, you should come
over Friday night.

01:05.313 --> 01:07.182
Drew took a cooking class
on the ship,

01:07.250 --> 01:09.217
and he's cooking up some recipes he learned.
Oh, yeah!

01:09.285 --> 01:10.885
And then you can meet
Ron and Peggy,

01:10.953 --> 01:12.554
one of the other couples
from the cruise.

01:12.622 --> 01:14.022
They're super nice.
They're super fat.

01:14.090 --> 01:15.257
All right. Yeah.

01:15.325 --> 01:17.225
Sickness, Ry.
Well...

01:17.293 --> 01:19.161
what do you say
we loosen up these OJs

01:19.229 --> 01:20.863
with a few bubbles?

01:20.930 --> 01:22.431
Drew, it's 10:00
in the morning.

01:22.499 --> 01:24.566
Ah, just a little
"hair of the dog."

01:24.634 --> 01:25.901
Ooh! Ah...

01:27.771 --> 01:30.540
Oh, looks like the cork
scared Wilfy a little.

01:32.710 --> 01:35.412
Jesus offers you a fresh start,

01:35.480 --> 01:36.881
- a clean slate...
- Hey!

01:36.948 --> 01:38.983
Can you turn that religious
bullshit off?

01:39.050 --> 01:40.884
I'm trying to enjoy
a blumpkin in here!

01:40.952 --> 01:42.752
And in return,
he asks for nothing

01:42.820 --> 01:45.522
but your unquestioning faith
and commitment.

01:45.590 --> 01:47.191
If you receive
this pardon from God,

01:47.258 --> 01:49.226
you can stand before anyone

01:49.294 --> 01:50.795
with peace and calm in your heart.
What is wrong with you?

01:50.862 --> 01:52.163
Nothing.

01:52.231 --> 01:53.471
Because if you're ready to die,

01:53.532 --> 01:54.599
you're ready to live.

01:56.369 --> 01:58.136
Thinking about Amanda again?

01:58.204 --> 02:00.638
God, I wish everyone would
stop asking about Amanda.

02:00.706 --> 02:02.340
I'm totally fine, okay?

02:02.408 --> 02:05.610
Ryan, every dog has
this one itchy spot

02:05.678 --> 02:07.178
on his back,
just above the tail.

02:07.246 --> 02:08.613
And try as he may,

02:08.681 --> 02:10.449
he can never
scratch it himself.

02:10.515 --> 02:14.019
I mean, sure, he can try
to rub it up against a tree

02:14.086 --> 02:16.688
or up against
the underside of a couch,

02:16.756 --> 02:18.056
but it's never as comforting

02:18.124 --> 02:20.425
as the fingernails
of a good friend.

02:20.493 --> 02:21.559
What, do you want me
to cry on your shoulder?

02:21.627 --> 02:23.094
Hell, no!

02:23.162 --> 02:24.663
I'm not talking about
coming to me for comfort.

02:24.730 --> 02:26.231
Why would I comfort you?

02:26.298 --> 02:28.139
I mean, you've hardly
been there for me lately.

02:28.167 --> 02:29.568
What are you talking about?

02:29.635 --> 02:31.670
Right.

02:31.738 --> 02:32.871
I'm serious.
What's wrong?

02:32.939 --> 02:34.873
Ryan...

02:34.941 --> 02:36.675
Jenna and Drew died.

02:36.742 --> 02:38.643
Wait, what?

02:38.711 --> 02:41.813
Yeah, they died for,
like, 17 days.

02:41.881 --> 02:43.949
I'm glad they finally
came back, though.

02:44.017 --> 02:46.151
Wilfred, they were just
on their honeymoon.

02:46.219 --> 02:47.719
Just 'cause you don't see
someone for a while

02:47.787 --> 02:49.087
doesn't mean they're dead.

02:49.155 --> 02:50.856
Ah... I'm pretty sure
they're dead.

02:50.924 --> 02:52.291
I looked everywhere for them.

02:52.358 --> 02:55.361
You think that death is
like a vacation?

02:55.428 --> 02:56.796
That's not how it works.

02:56.863 --> 02:58.263
Do you remember Shep,
the Great Dane

02:58.265 --> 02:59.632
you used to see at the park?

02:59.700 --> 03:01.634
Yeah, old Shep
with the gray face

03:01.702 --> 03:04.070
and the funny cancers
he was always joking about.

03:04.138 --> 03:05.605
Yeah, he's been dead
quite a while.

03:05.673 --> 03:07.407
Should be back any day now.

03:07.475 --> 03:10.645
Wilfred, when people die--
really die--

03:10.712 --> 03:11.946
then they're dead.

03:12.014 --> 03:13.381
That's it.

03:13.449 --> 03:14.582
They-they don't get
to come back.

03:14.650 --> 03:16.251
Wait.

03:16.319 --> 03:18.687
So, my grandmother,
my-my parents...

03:18.755 --> 03:21.356
they're not coming back?

03:21.424 --> 03:23.659
Holy shit.

03:23.727 --> 03:27.096
<i>Marley and Me</i> is
a really sad movie.

03:27.164 --> 03:28.698
God, why was I laughing
the whole time?

03:31.769 --> 03:33.036
What is it?

03:33.104 --> 03:34.270
My nemesis.

03:34.338 --> 03:35.805
The bane of all dogs.

03:35.873 --> 03:37.574
The mailman?
Exactly.

03:37.641 --> 03:38.975
Wait...

03:39.043 --> 03:40.710
It all makes sense now.

03:40.778 --> 03:42.645
He just goes away for a while,

03:42.713 --> 03:44.047
and then comes back.

03:44.115 --> 03:45.382
God, I feel like such an idiot!

03:45.450 --> 03:47.384
He was never actually dead.

03:47.452 --> 03:50.521
Until now.

03:50.589 --> 03:52.790
The United States Postal Service
is a lie!

03:52.858 --> 03:56.060
Wilfred, stop it!
Yeah, they act all kind and benevolent.

03:56.128 --> 03:57.728
Sorry, just one sec!
But then they come to your house

03:57.796 --> 03:59.463
and drop off your mail!

04:00.799 --> 04:03.468
Hey, I'm, uh, Bill.

04:03.536 --> 04:05.003
Your mailman.
Obviously.

04:05.071 --> 04:06.170
Here's your mail.

04:10.409 --> 04:12.143
Did you need a signature or...?
Uh...

04:12.211 --> 04:13.978
No, uh... it's kind of
embarrassing,

04:14.046 --> 04:15.813
but do you mind
if I use your bathroom?

04:15.881 --> 04:17.214
It's sort of an emergency.

04:17.283 --> 04:18.644
Don't invite him in, Ryan!

04:18.684 --> 04:21.086
He can't come in
if you don't invite him!

04:21.153 --> 04:22.420
Yeah, sure.

04:22.488 --> 04:24.823
You can totally use
my bathroom,

04:24.891 --> 04:26.692
Mailman Bill.

04:26.760 --> 04:28.060
You're letting
him shit in the house?!

04:28.128 --> 04:29.762
I don't even get
to shit in the house!

04:29.830 --> 04:32.631
Oh, uh... I don't mean
to be such a princess,

04:32.699 --> 04:35.019
but there's no way the dog can
get through that door, right?

04:35.035 --> 04:37.670
A buddy of mine had sort of an incident.
Oh.

04:37.737 --> 04:39.505
Don't worry, you're fine.
Okay.

04:39.572 --> 04:41.106
- Just, uh...
- I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

04:41.174 --> 04:43.042
Thank you.
I'll kill you!

04:43.110 --> 04:44.777
I'll kill you...
I'll kill you...

04:44.845 --> 04:46.679
- I'll kill you...
- Ooh, thank you.

04:46.747 --> 04:49.715
I'll kill you...
Really enjoyed your toilet reading, by the way.

04:49.783 --> 04:51.751
Alan Moore? <i>Miracleman?</i>
Classic.

04:51.819 --> 04:54.186
Yeah, I've got every issue
except number 15.

04:54.254 --> 04:55.788
Oh.
It's too bad it's out of print.

04:55.856 --> 04:57.323
Yeah.
You like Alan Moore?

04:57.391 --> 04:59.692
Uh, yeah.

04:59.760 --> 05:01.227
Rorschach?
Awesome.

05:01.295 --> 05:02.729
Yeah.

05:02.796 --> 05:04.030
Whoa, is that a pentagram?

05:04.098 --> 05:05.598
Oh. Yeah.

05:05.666 --> 05:07.967
My ex-girlfriend and I met
at a Slayer concert.

05:08.035 --> 05:10.269
So, me being
the romantic that I am,

05:10.337 --> 05:12.705
I decided to get a tattoo
to celebrate our anniversary.

05:12.773 --> 05:14.507
Nice.
Yeah... only, a week later,

05:14.574 --> 05:15.942
she goes nuts and dumps me

05:16.009 --> 05:17.544
for a guy she met at Chipotle.

05:17.611 --> 05:19.846
Ah! No point in dredging up
old bullshit like that.

05:19.914 --> 05:21.047
Right.

05:21.115 --> 05:22.549
Well, I'd better get on my way

05:22.616 --> 05:24.451
if I'm gonna finish my route
by happy hour.

05:24.518 --> 05:27.220
Tell you what, you should meet
me in Hinano's in an hour,

05:27.288 --> 05:29.822
and I'll bring by a copy
of <i>Miracleman</i> number 15.

05:29.890 --> 05:31.056
Oh, cool.

05:31.124 --> 05:32.258
Yeah, maybe I'll see you there.

05:32.325 --> 05:33.492
Well, great.

05:39.298 --> 05:41.399
Wilfred!
What are you doing here?

05:41.467 --> 05:42.767
Sorry, I just have
so many questions

05:42.835 --> 05:44.335
about this death thing.

05:44.403 --> 05:45.937
I'm meeting Bill right now.
Please.

05:46.004 --> 05:47.271
Just one question.

05:47.339 --> 05:49.373
You said earlier that
when someone dies,

05:49.441 --> 05:50.608
they don't come back.

05:50.675 --> 05:51.876
Where do they go?

05:54.079 --> 05:55.546
Well...

05:55.613 --> 05:58.249
some people believe
that nothing happens.

05:58.316 --> 06:00.117
That you just "turn off,"
like a light switch.

06:00.151 --> 06:01.752
But if you're religious,

06:01.820 --> 06:03.153
like if you're Christian,
for instance,

06:03.221 --> 06:04.154
then you believe
in a place called Heaven.

06:04.222 --> 06:05.288
Heaven?

06:05.356 --> 06:06.857
Eternal paradise,

06:06.924 --> 06:08.725
where you and God and Jesus
all live together...

06:08.793 --> 06:10.294
Look, I-I don't know
what happens, Wilfred.

06:10.361 --> 06:11.528
I have to go.

06:11.596 --> 06:13.130
Well, wait.

06:13.197 --> 06:14.564
How can you leave me
at a time like this?

06:14.632 --> 06:16.533
I'm having a crisis here!

06:18.000 --> 06:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:25.910 --> 06:26.977
Are you sure that's okay?

06:27.045 --> 06:28.245
Oh, yeah.

06:28.313 --> 06:29.780
This is an "undeliverable."

06:29.847 --> 06:31.915
You see, the rain washed out
the address,

06:31.983 --> 06:33.551
and look,
there's not even a zip code.

06:33.618 --> 06:35.553
So this thing's headed
straight for the garbage.

06:35.621 --> 06:37.255
Let's see what we got, here.

06:37.322 --> 06:38.856
"Dear Steven,

06:38.924 --> 06:41.392
I've been thinking of you
more and more these days."

06:41.459 --> 06:42.893
Whoa.

06:42.961 --> 06:45.896
"I remember the nights
we spent together last fall.

06:45.964 --> 06:48.666
We did some things that
I both cherish and regret."

06:48.734 --> 06:51.235
Oh!
Well, this girl's a pretty good writer.

06:51.303 --> 06:52.536
"I still have memories

06:52.604 --> 06:54.772
of your massiveness
in my mouth"?

06:54.840 --> 06:55.973
Oh!
Whoa!

06:56.041 --> 06:57.308
Holy shit!

06:57.376 --> 06:59.143
Okay, this girl is a freak.

06:59.211 --> 07:00.577
Still,
pretty good writing, though.

07:00.645 --> 07:04.047
"But I just got the results back
from my HIV test,

07:04.115 --> 07:06.916
"and I'm heartbroken to say
that they came back positive.

07:06.984 --> 07:09.552
"I know that you just
returned from Afghanistan

07:09.620 --> 07:12.388
and are struggling with
your own PTSD issues..."

07:23.133 --> 07:25.000
Shit!

07:25.067 --> 07:26.368
Are you kidding me, man?

07:26.435 --> 07:28.603
That was crazy.
Oh...

07:28.670 --> 07:30.771
I remember one time
my buddy Barry

07:30.839 --> 07:32.640
had this undeliverable,
and it was, like...

07:34.877 --> 07:36.510
Oh, man, Barry...

07:36.578 --> 07:38.345
Who's Barry?

07:38.413 --> 07:40.347
Ah, just a guy that...
We used to work together.

07:40.415 --> 07:41.649
He's, uh...

07:41.717 --> 07:43.484
Hello! Here we go.

07:43.552 --> 07:45.052
This is what I'm talking about.
These are great.

07:45.120 --> 07:46.520
As long as you don't mind

07:46.588 --> 07:48.689
putting this massiveness
in your mouth.

07:48.757 --> 07:50.825
Oh...

07:56.432 --> 07:58.233
It's okay, Ryan.

07:58.301 --> 07:59.634
Wilfred!

07:59.702 --> 08:01.269
What the hell did you do?

08:01.337 --> 08:03.705
As you know, I was locked
inside a small car

08:03.773 --> 08:05.273
with black leather interior

08:05.341 --> 08:07.175
for hours as it baked
in the hot sun.

08:07.243 --> 08:08.944
And as I sat there
contemplating death,

08:09.012 --> 08:12.080
real death came upon me.

08:12.148 --> 08:13.682
I began overheating.

08:13.750 --> 08:15.484
I couldn't pant fast enough.

08:15.552 --> 08:18.253
I started to make these little,
squeaky whimpering noises

08:18.321 --> 08:19.481
that conveyed my desperation.

08:19.489 --> 08:21.023
And then suddenly,

08:21.090 --> 08:22.491
a thin, pale man

08:22.558 --> 08:23.825
with long hair and a beard

08:23.893 --> 08:25.260
appeared outside my window.

08:25.328 --> 08:27.162
He broke the glass

08:27.230 --> 08:29.564
and freed me
from death's clutches.

08:29.632 --> 08:31.266
It was Jesus!

08:31.334 --> 08:33.934
And Jesus stole my radio?

08:34.003 --> 08:35.837
The Lord works
in mysterious ways.

08:35.905 --> 08:37.806
You see,
I'm no longer frightened

08:37.873 --> 08:40.241
of the concept of death.

08:40.308 --> 08:42.177
The Lord is my shepherd.

08:42.245 --> 08:45.514
With his rod and his staff,
he comforts me.

08:48.051 --> 08:50.319
I've been saved.

08:50.386 --> 08:54.339
I have been saved, Ryan!

08:58.883 --> 09:00.123
Brought you a little something.

09:00.151 --> 09:01.418
Rosary beads?

09:01.485 --> 09:04.187
They're meant
to aid you in prayer.

09:04.255 --> 09:06.890
Before I was saved,
I used to use them

09:06.958 --> 09:09.016
for sinful, carnal purposes.

09:11.196 --> 09:13.764
Wow, you're really taking
this religious shit seriously.

09:13.832 --> 09:17.502
I once was lost
but now I'm found.

09:17.570 --> 09:18.803
Oh, Bear!

09:18.871 --> 09:20.805
Put away those wicked breasts!

09:20.873 --> 09:22.374
We're not even married!

09:22.442 --> 09:23.863
And unspread that!

09:25.211 --> 09:26.491
Why are you wearing
my underwear?

09:26.545 --> 09:27.845
To cover my nakedness.

09:27.913 --> 09:29.280
That looks painful.

09:29.348 --> 09:31.315
How are you gonna
wag your tail?

09:31.383 --> 09:32.650
When one walks
with the Lord, Ryan,

09:32.717 --> 09:34.451
one's tail is always wagging.

09:34.519 --> 09:36.820
Whatever. I'm going
to Hinano's to meet Bill.

09:36.888 --> 09:38.388
That Satanist?

09:38.456 --> 09:40.356
I've seen his pentagram tattoo.

09:40.424 --> 09:41.825
Mark of the devil.

09:41.892 --> 09:43.860
It's just an old Slayer tattoo.

09:43.927 --> 09:45.461
Wait.

09:45.529 --> 09:47.130
This whole religious thing
is just an act

09:47.198 --> 09:48.665
because you hate the fact

09:48.733 --> 09:50.000
that I'm hanging out
with the mailman.

09:50.067 --> 09:51.768
I don't hate mailmen.

09:51.836 --> 09:54.471
I love all God's creatures,
even certain Jews.

09:54.539 --> 09:56.439
What would your God-fearing
Christian friends,

09:56.507 --> 09:57.941
Jenna and Drew,

09:58.009 --> 10:00.177
think about you fraternizing
with a Satanist?

10:00.244 --> 10:02.179
They're not even that religious.
Not religious?

10:02.246 --> 10:03.947
Does Jenna not cry out
to God late at night

10:04.015 --> 10:05.515
when she layeth with Drew?

10:05.583 --> 10:07.717
Does Drew not call out
the name of Jesus

10:07.785 --> 10:10.320
when someone lands on "Bankrupt"
on <i>Wheel of Fortune?</i>

10:10.387 --> 10:12.388
I'll pray for you,
Brother Newman.

10:14.992 --> 10:17.193
It's not like one of
those office jobs

10:17.260 --> 10:18.940
where you got to get
to know your coworkers

10:18.995 --> 10:20.629
and hear all about their
dreams and relationships.

10:20.697 --> 10:22.097
Where do I sign up?

10:22.165 --> 10:23.465
Right?

10:23.532 --> 10:25.700
Man, I mean,
every day is a cake walk, man.

10:25.768 --> 10:27.068
I mean, I'm strolling
around the neighborhood,

10:27.136 --> 10:28.737
dropping off the mail,

10:28.805 --> 10:31.140
sometimes I smoke a joint in the truck...

10:31.207 --> 10:33.275
...and then I take a shit in
somebody's really nice bathroom.

10:33.343 --> 10:35.878
By the way, Mrs. Phillips,
across the street from you?

10:35.946 --> 10:37.613
She's got a bidet.

10:37.681 --> 10:39.415
Water pressure?

10:39.483 --> 10:41.317
Strong.
Oh...

10:41.385 --> 10:42.852
Ryan.

10:44.888 --> 10:46.689
Oh. Hey.

10:46.756 --> 10:47.956
What are you guys doing here?

10:48.024 --> 10:50.058
I got your text.

10:50.126 --> 10:51.860
You said to meet you
here for lunch.

10:51.928 --> 10:53.496
Looks like you guys
started without us.

10:53.563 --> 10:55.331
Oh. Right.

10:55.399 --> 10:56.866
Although I wasn't
really sure what you meant

10:56.934 --> 10:59.502
when you said I should conceal
my dirty pillows.

10:59.570 --> 11:01.371
Am I missing some joke?

11:01.439 --> 11:04.074
Oh, I-I meant to
text that to my...

11:04.142 --> 11:05.008
sister.

11:06.111 --> 11:08.245
It's an inside joke.

11:08.312 --> 11:10.580
Bill, these are my neighbors,
Jenna and Drew.

11:10.648 --> 11:11.514
Oh, yeah!

11:11.582 --> 11:12.982
You're the mail guy.

11:13.050 --> 11:15.251
We live at, uh,
2304 Webster Avenue.

11:15.319 --> 11:16.285
Yeah, sure.

11:16.353 --> 11:17.887
Right on.

11:17.954 --> 11:20.355
Hey, thanks for the
Christmas gift last year.

11:20.423 --> 11:23.892
Five dollar Starbucks gift
card-- very thoughtful.

11:23.960 --> 11:25.494
Well, you do a good job,
and I figured

11:25.561 --> 11:26.895
you could use the caffeine.

11:26.963 --> 11:29.332
Hey... so you're
still joining us

11:29.400 --> 11:30.600
for dinner tonight, right?

11:30.668 --> 11:31.935
Um, yeah, yeah.

11:32.003 --> 11:33.603
Looking forward to it.

11:33.671 --> 11:36.506
I was thinking--
maybe I'll tell Ron and Peggy

11:36.574 --> 11:37.774
to come a different night.

11:37.841 --> 11:39.676
It might be better
if it's just us.

11:39.743 --> 11:43.246
You know, so we can talk.

11:43.314 --> 11:44.981
You don't
have to do that.

11:45.049 --> 11:47.550
Okay, who ordered
the Knockers Shot?

11:48.586 --> 11:50.654
No, no, no, no, no, no.

11:50.721 --> 11:52.589
Right there, Ginny.

11:53.624 --> 11:54.891
Oh.

11:54.959 --> 11:55.959
Oh, yeah.

12:03.201 --> 12:05.503
It's good.

12:07.506 --> 12:10.074
Nice try, sending
your "missionaries" to save me.

12:10.142 --> 12:12.476
But it's not gonna work.

12:12.544 --> 12:13.444
I do.

12:26.257 --> 12:27.690
Congratulations.

12:27.758 --> 12:29.038
I hope you two
will be very happy

12:29.093 --> 12:30.893
now that you can
finally have sex.

12:30.961 --> 12:32.428
Thank you all for coming.

12:32.496 --> 12:34.563
As planned,
a reception will follow

12:34.631 --> 12:37.399
at the sour milk puddle
behind Baskin Robbins.

12:37.467 --> 12:40.035
Sorry, Ryan, we're just trying
to keep the numbers down.

12:40.103 --> 12:42.204
It's really just family
and close friends.

12:42.272 --> 12:44.106
And a few people Bear's
dad used to work with.

12:44.174 --> 12:46.675
Besides, I knew you had
Jenna's thing tonight, so...

12:46.743 --> 12:48.711
I'm not going to Jenna's.

12:48.778 --> 12:50.412
Thanks to your little stunt,

12:50.480 --> 12:53.349
she's turning the dinner
into a therapy session.

12:53.417 --> 12:54.917
Where's my weed?

12:54.985 --> 12:56.352
Your drugs?

12:56.420 --> 12:58.354
I flushed them down the toilet.

12:58.421 --> 12:59.989
Well, I placed them
in the toilet.

13:00.057 --> 13:02.225
I have no idea how to
operate the flush handle.

13:08.599 --> 13:11.100
Do you accept Jesus Christ
as your lord and savior?

13:11.168 --> 13:13.469
Do you promise to live every day
with him in your heart?

13:13.537 --> 13:14.637
Wilfred, stop!

13:14.705 --> 13:18.374
I hereby baptize you,
Ryan Newman,

13:18.442 --> 13:21.043
in the name of the Father
and the Son

13:21.111 --> 13:23.279
and the Holy Spirit!

13:29.120 --> 13:31.221
Goddamn it, Wilfred!

13:31.289 --> 13:33.157
Name in vain, dude.

13:33.224 --> 13:34.264
You're insane.
Well, I hope

13:34.292 --> 13:35.492
I've helped you change your mind

13:35.560 --> 13:36.627
about going to Jenna's tonight.

13:36.695 --> 13:38.129
I'm going to Bill's.

13:38.197 --> 13:39.965
To hang out with his
Satanist friends.

13:40.032 --> 13:41.733
Because unlike Jenna,
Bill doesn't dwell

13:41.801 --> 13:43.401
on bullshit from the past.

13:43.469 --> 13:46.704
But like you, Ryan, Bill
can only stem the tides

13:46.772 --> 13:49.640
of his grief for so
long before he snaps!

13:49.708 --> 13:51.609
Snaps? Bill's not
the snapping type.

13:51.676 --> 13:53.110
And when it happens,

13:53.178 --> 13:54.812
I only hope he has
good friends around

13:54.880 --> 13:56.714
to pick up the pieces.

13:59.351 --> 14:02.053
♪ What a friend ♪

14:02.121 --> 14:03.922
♪ We have ♪

14:03.989 --> 14:07.525
♪ In Jesus. ♪

14:11.384 --> 14:13.652
Hey, Ryan--come on in, man.
Hey.

14:13.719 --> 14:15.120
Guys, this is Ryan.

14:15.188 --> 14:17.222
Ryan, these are
a few work friends here.

14:17.290 --> 14:18.757
We got Todd, Darren,

14:18.825 --> 14:21.159
and the lovely Joanne.

14:21.227 --> 14:22.361
Oh, hey, man.

14:22.428 --> 14:23.362
You didn't need to bring that.

14:23.429 --> 14:24.796
We got it covered tonight.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.432
Thanks to Joanne--
she brought over

14:26.500 --> 14:29.635
a box of "confiscationables."

14:29.703 --> 14:31.703
Yeah, you see, certain
items are illegal

14:31.771 --> 14:33.271
to send through the mail.

14:33.339 --> 14:35.240
The postal service
confiscates these things,

14:35.308 --> 14:37.876
but there's no real system
in place to dispose of it all.

14:37.944 --> 14:40.311
So it just kind of sits around
in a big room somewhere.

14:40.379 --> 14:41.913
So, why let it go
to waste-- right, guys?

14:43.048 --> 14:44.749
Sounds fun.
Yeah, man.

14:44.816 --> 14:46.216
Aw, check it out!

14:46.284 --> 14:48.585
Absinthe--
like, real absinthe

14:48.653 --> 14:50.387
from the Czech Republic.

14:50.454 --> 14:51.354
<i>Willkommen.</i>

14:52.490 --> 14:54.157
Fireworks!

14:54.225 --> 14:55.859
Oh, do you guys remember that

14:55.927 --> 14:57.294
Fourth of July?
I think it was in the Marina.

14:57.362 --> 14:58.429
Barry had, um...

15:00.098 --> 15:01.766
...those, um...

15:05.237 --> 15:06.471
Hey, we got some

15:06.539 --> 15:08.774
Crate and Barrel
silverware here.

15:08.841 --> 15:12.010
Actually, I don't think
these are confiscationables.

15:12.078 --> 15:13.078
Oh! What's that smell?

15:13.146 --> 15:15.847
Ew-- who farted?

15:19.018 --> 15:20.953
Excuse me.

15:23.556 --> 15:24.757
Wilfred,
what are you doing here?

15:24.824 --> 15:26.525
I came here because
I was visited again.

15:26.593 --> 15:29.295
This time by God himself.

15:29.362 --> 15:31.197
Go home, Wilfred.
Ryan, listen to me.

15:31.265 --> 15:33.299
I was in the basement,
consummating my marriage,

15:33.367 --> 15:37.070
when I embarrassingly quick-came
and then heard a crash upstairs.

15:37.138 --> 15:40.073
I ran up, and there he was.

15:41.730 --> 15:43.998
He was beautiful, Ryan.

15:44.066 --> 15:45.867
Immaculate skin.

15:45.935 --> 15:47.369
Otherworldly

15:47.436 --> 15:49.437
gold teeth, cornrows.

15:49.505 --> 15:50.639
All cracked out.

15:50.706 --> 15:52.340
Wilfred, that was a burglar.

15:52.408 --> 15:54.409
It was God, Ryan.

15:54.476 --> 15:57.145
And as God was carrying
your flat-screen TV

15:57.212 --> 16:00.148
out the back door, he looked at
me as if to say, "Go, my son.

16:00.215 --> 16:02.650
"Smite these sinners.

16:02.718 --> 16:05.019
"Wipe this present-day
Sodom and Gomorrah

16:05.087 --> 16:07.121
off the face of the earth."
Bullshit.

16:07.188 --> 16:09.089
You don't like mailmen--
that's what this is all about.

16:09.157 --> 16:11.392
I hate sinners, Ryan.

16:11.459 --> 16:14.996
And we are in
the midst of sinners.

16:15.064 --> 16:16.598
Satanist...

16:16.666 --> 16:18.500
adulterer, glutton.

16:18.568 --> 16:22.605
Lead-singer-of-Smash-Mouth-
hand-job-giver.

16:22.673 --> 16:26.776
As God is my witness,
this all ends tonight!

16:26.844 --> 16:29.113
I say hear me now,
all ye sinners

16:29.180 --> 16:32.082
in the hands of an angry God!

16:32.150 --> 16:35.252
Fire and brimstone
shall rain down upon you!

16:35.319 --> 16:36.787
Get that thing out of here!

16:36.854 --> 16:38.288
Ooh!

16:38.356 --> 16:40.924
Is this a candle sitting
on a low table?

16:40.992 --> 16:42.058
No, no, no!

16:42.126 --> 16:44.527
Lord, use
my recklessly wagging tail

16:44.595 --> 16:47.130
as a vessel to do your bidding!

16:47.198 --> 16:49.265
Shit, the fireworks!

16:50.901 --> 16:54.170
Praise be to God!

16:56.106 --> 16:59.775
Oh, must've been a box of duds.

16:59.843 --> 17:01.544
Oh, thank God.

17:01.611 --> 17:03.746
But how is this possible?

17:03.813 --> 17:06.248
Why have you forsaken me, God?

17:06.316 --> 17:08.217
I give my life

17:08.285 --> 17:09.952
in service of you...

17:10.020 --> 17:13.056
and you totally dick me over.

17:13.123 --> 17:15.058
Hey, man, it's cool.

17:15.126 --> 17:16.593
The fireworks are outside.

17:16.660 --> 17:17.926
Yeah, just...

17:17.994 --> 17:19.996
something about
the dog freaking out...

17:20.064 --> 17:22.832
it reminded me of Barry.

17:22.900 --> 17:25.068
It's over now.

17:25.135 --> 17:27.203
Now, why bring the mood down

17:27.271 --> 17:29.940
by talking about Barry?

17:30.008 --> 17:31.442
Hey, I got a great idea.

17:31.509 --> 17:33.077
Let's break out that box

17:33.144 --> 17:35.479
of endangered tree frogs and get crazy...
No!

17:35.547 --> 17:38.549
It's about damn time
we talked about Barry.

17:38.617 --> 17:40.518
Barry was our friend.

17:40.585 --> 17:42.520
And I miss the shit out of him.

17:42.587 --> 17:45.756
It's not like talking about
Barry's gonna bring him back.

17:45.824 --> 17:47.091
Does it suck?

17:47.159 --> 17:48.959
Yeah, it sucks.

17:49.027 --> 17:51.529
One minute he's walking around
delivering mail,

17:51.597 --> 17:54.231
and the next he's having
his carotid artery ripped open

17:54.299 --> 17:57.068
by a 120-pound pit bull!

17:57.135 --> 17:59.070
It's sad, man!

17:59.138 --> 18:00.571
It's sad as shit!

18:00.639 --> 18:02.840
You think I don't
think about that?

18:02.908 --> 18:06.010
I think about that
every goddamn day!

18:06.078 --> 18:07.612
Every day!

18:09.581 --> 18:12.450
Bill could only stem the tides
of his grief for so long.

18:12.518 --> 18:14.586
He certainly can't turn

18:14.653 --> 18:16.654
to God for comfort.

18:16.722 --> 18:18.289
You were right, Ryan.

18:18.357 --> 18:19.958
God is a fake-ass,
little bitch.

18:20.025 --> 18:21.392
I never said that.
I'm just saying,

18:21.460 --> 18:23.828
fire and brimstone
never rained down the way

18:23.896 --> 18:25.931
God said it would,
so he's obviously...

18:34.612 --> 18:37.110
Ryan?

18:41.194 --> 18:43.190
Well, we missed you
last night at dinner.

18:43.310 --> 18:45.945
I'm sorry I didn't make it.

18:46.013 --> 18:48.681
I didn't come 'cause I...

18:50.818 --> 18:54.653
You know, I had this amazing
boyfriend in high school.

18:54.721 --> 18:59.090
He-he was handsome
and funny and smart and...

18:59.158 --> 19:01.092
But after a while
I started to feel like

19:01.159 --> 19:02.827
he was hiding
something from me.

19:02.894 --> 19:05.595
It turns out that he...

19:05.663 --> 19:08.598
he had a bad addiction.

19:08.665 --> 19:10.332
I broke up with him, but...

19:10.400 --> 19:11.961
then I felt like I was
a terrible person

19:12.001 --> 19:13.968
for not sticking around
to help him get better.

19:14.036 --> 19:17.571
Was it my fault for missing
the warning signs?

19:17.639 --> 19:19.739
I mean, looking back,
it was no one's fault.

19:19.807 --> 19:22.508
We can't help who
we fall in love with.

19:22.576 --> 19:25.377
And we can't help everyone
we fall in love with.

19:27.646 --> 19:30.682
So was it, like,
a drug addiction?

19:30.749 --> 19:33.851
Actually, he had a,
um, shopping addiction.

19:33.919 --> 19:36.854
Which eventually became
a shoplifting addiction.

19:36.921 --> 19:39.623
Basically, he had
this obsession with shoes.

19:39.691 --> 19:41.758
Oh, so he was gay?

19:41.826 --> 19:43.893
No, I-I told you--
he was my boyfriend.

19:46.062 --> 19:49.798
Oh, my God...

19:49.866 --> 19:52.200
Oh, my God--
he was totally gay.

19:52.268 --> 19:53.768
Oh, no.

19:53.836 --> 19:56.604
He used to always drag me
to the swim meets.

19:56.672 --> 19:58.306
And I thought he was just, like,
a really big fan of swimming.

20:03.111 --> 20:04.778
Oh, my God.

20:04.845 --> 20:07.313
Well...

20:07.381 --> 20:10.316
So, dinner next weekend, okay?

20:10.384 --> 20:11.551
No excuses.

20:11.618 --> 20:12.518
You got it.

20:16.089 --> 20:18.024
They don't make 'em
like that anymore.

20:18.092 --> 20:19.563
They sure don't.

20:20.906 --> 20:21.806
We're both talking

20:21.873 --> 20:23.043
about her sneakers, right?

20:23.111 --> 20:24.177
What?

20:24.245 --> 20:25.912
Vintage Tretorn tennis sneakers.

20:25.980 --> 20:27.681
They don't make 'em
like that anymore.

20:27.748 --> 20:30.216
Yeah, totally.

20:41.527 --> 20:42.994
Wow.

20:43.061 --> 20:44.628
You can actually hear that?

20:44.696 --> 20:46.930
Yes, Ryan, I can.

20:51.468 --> 20:53.802
Oh, wow, so you can
actually hear that?

20:54.063 --> 20:55.986
Jesus, Wilfred, you
could damage my...
