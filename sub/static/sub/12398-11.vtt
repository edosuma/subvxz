35:04.144 --> 35:07.307
Sergei, you won't hurt her.

35:07.856 --> 35:09.642
We had a deal.

35:10.358 --> 35:15.978
She and her associate killed half
of my men. I cannot let that stand.

35:16.531 --> 35:19.443
You promised not to hurt Alexandra.

35:22.287 --> 35:24.949
But she's not
your Alexandra anymore, Katya.

35:26.458 --> 35:27.948
You must see that now.

35:32.505 --> 35:34.996
| see many things now.

35:43.975 --> 35:48.014
Living down here,
I've had time to reflect.

35:49.814 --> 35:52.021
You know what I've come to realize?

35:52.192 --> 35:53.898
You like your reflection.

36:00.283 --> 36:03.275
...but that I can also learn from them.

36:03.536 --> 36:06.699
Sometimes all you need
is a slight shift in perspective...

36:06.915 --> 36:09.281
...to bring things into focus.

36:09.501 --> 36:10.991
You have had time to reflect.

36:14.297 --> 36:16.162
I've also had time to plan.

36:16.633 --> 36:18.043
Against Oversight?

36:18.301 --> 36:21.418
I told you, they're irrelevant.

36:22.514 --> 36:26.553
As you said, there's always a group
behind the group.

36:27.143 --> 36:29.850
If you look close,
you'll see there's a door up there.

36:31.981 --> 36:33.937
Where could you possibly go?

36:36.695 --> 36:39.061
To a higher place.

36:41.157 --> 36:42.863
Not the place you're thinking of.

36:48.873 --> 36:51.910
-Phone's a dead end.
-We know they're headed home.

36:52.085 --> 36:55.248
Roan's running things. He's how
Percy's communicating with them.

36:55.964 --> 36:59.081
-We were his insurance policy.
-What?

36:59.259 --> 37:02.751
The guardians. We were the thing
that kept Percy alive.

37:03.221 --> 37:06.088
Percy planned for every contingency.
In the event of his death...

37:06.266 --> 37:09.554
...we were to upload the boxes.
Maybe in the event of his capture....

37:10.729 --> 37:11.764
You'd break him out.

37:15.108 --> 37:18.271
I'll stay home until you get here
and we'll figure out the Percy stuff then.

37:20.488 --> 37:23.275
Owen thinks we Should
let him escape and then shoot him.

37:23.491 --> 37:24.742
NIKITA:
That's not a bad idea.

37:25.160 --> 37:29.494
Although, we'd probably fight over
who got to shoot him first.

37:30.373 --> 37:32.034
And we should talk...

37:32.542 --> 37:37.206
...about us and where we stand.

37:39.299 --> 37:41.210
I'll be here.

37:49.017 --> 37:51.303
MICHAEL:
You don't have to go on this one.

37:53.104 --> 37:55.971
I can talk to Percy,
find another agent for Pale Fire.

37:56.149 --> 37:59.141
-Maybe Kelly.
-Oh, She'd love that.

37:59.569 --> 38:01.059
I'd never hear the end of it.

38:02.530 --> 38:03.986
Nikita.

38:05.116 --> 38:07.823
I know you hate
these kinds of missions.

38:08.661 --> 38:12.153
-With civilians.
-lt's important to Percy, right?

38:13.750 --> 38:15.615
Be good for me to go.

38:19.506 --> 38:21.667
You're a capable agent.

38:21.841 --> 38:24.082
You don't have to prove that
to him anymore.

38:26.596 --> 38:31.340
You once told me
that Division was a second chance...

38:31.643 --> 38:34.601
...an opportunity to be a new person,
make a difference.

38:35.563 --> 38:40.432
This mission, this is how I prove to myself
what kind of person I've become.

39:07.095 --> 39:13.512
You know, for years,
I've had these memories to hold on to...

39:14.352 --> 39:16.889
...an image in my head of what I'd lost.

39:17.730 --> 39:23.600
No matter how bad things got,
I could close my eyes...

39:24.612 --> 39:25.727
...and they were there.

39:27.407 --> 39:29.068
It's what got you through.

39:29.701 --> 39:31.237
But it was a lie.

39:33.079 --> 39:36.367
And now I can't even trust
my own memories.

39:37.417 --> 39:39.533
Her and Semak.

39:41.671 --> 39:43.662
I never had a clue.

39:43.840 --> 39:47.332
You were a kid who loved your parents.

39:48.052 --> 39:51.385
I've wasted so much time...

39:51.556 --> 39:53.012
...and energy.

39:55.435 --> 39:57.596
Avenging what?

39:59.272 --> 40:02.935
A father that loved me
but wasn't innocent...

40:04.736 --> 40:06.772
...and a mother that...

40:09.449 --> 40:12.031
-...maybe never loved me at all.
-Alex.

40:16.956 --> 40:20.119
I don't understand Katya's choices...

40:21.794 --> 40:23.955
...but I do think that she loves you.

40:24.172 --> 40:25.457
You can't know that.

40:26.799 --> 40:29.962
She could have been
in on Semak's plan all along.

40:30.178 --> 40:35.093
No, I think that she's misguided
and not facing reality.

40:36.059 --> 40:39.722
But when she said that she wanted
to keep you safe...

40:39.938 --> 40:41.974
...I believed her.

40:43.483 --> 40:45.098
She was afraid of losing you.

40:45.276 --> 40:48.143
She was more afraid of losing him.

40:50.782 --> 40:53.319
I don't know how to get past that.

40:57.705 --> 40:59.821
You don't have to figure it all out
right now.

41:01.042 --> 41:02.077
[ALEX SIGHS]

41:02.251 --> 41:05.414
Don't give up on her. Not yet.

41:12.345 --> 41:14.210
I heard you.

41:16.516 --> 41:17.801
On the phone, you....

41:19.435 --> 41:23.849
Even after you knew what she did,
you still tried to reach her.

41:27.944 --> 41:29.980
People make mistakes.

41:30.154 --> 41:33.191
They make bad choices.

41:33.366 --> 41:37.029
And then, to make up for them,
they make even worse ones.

41:39.330 --> 41:42.117
But if you give them
a second chance...

41:43.042 --> 41:45.283
...sometimes they surprise you.

41:48.339 --> 41:50.000
Yeah.

41:50.550 --> 41:52.040
Sometimes they do.

42:22.081 --> 42:24.072
