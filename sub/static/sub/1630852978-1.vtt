00:11.711 --> 00:14.247
(gentle music)

00:25.892 --> 00:27.727
(suspenseful music)

00:27.727 --> 00:30.430
(birds chirping)

00:57.524 --> 01:00.427
(suspenseful music)

01:36.763 --> 01:38.631
(tense, eerie music)

01:38.631 --> 01:41.334
(dramatic music)

01:42.969 --> 01:45.605
(alarm beeping)

01:57.817 --> 02:02.689
(Spencer grunts) (alarm turns off)

02:07.260 --> 02:10.263
(metallic clacking)

02:20.206 --> 02:23.042
(water splashing)

02:26.479 --> 02:29.149
(Spencer sighs)

02:39.325 --> 02:41.828
(tense music)

02:52.138 --> 02:55.074
(metallic rattling)

02:57.744 --> 03:00.580
(coffee trickling)

03:09.055 --> 03:11.891
(alcohol pouring)

03:15.261 --> 03:18.097
(gulping alcohol)

03:22.902 --> 03:25.738
(alcohol pouring)

03:30.577 --> 03:33.580
(metallic rattling)

03:46.426 --> 03:49.262
(water splashing)

03:51.698 --> 03:54.400
(motor whirring)

03:58.071 --> 04:00.740
(birds chirping)

04:00.740 --> 04:02.375
- [Spencer] Morning.

04:06.112 --> 04:09.115
- Morning was an hour ago. It's nearly lunch.

04:13.620 --> 04:14.487
- What's all this?

04:15.655 --> 04:18.658
- Well, the mayor came in for his 9:00,

04:18.725 --> 04:20.994
he wanted you to know that he waited for 20 minutes,

04:20.994 --> 04:23.730
which was 19 minutes longer than he wanted to.

04:23.763 --> 04:24.964
I told him you were sick

04:24.964 --> 04:27.433
and we would follow up to reschedule.

04:27.467 --> 04:29.068
Fish and Game called twice.

04:29.068 --> 04:31.004
Seems they need someone to draft a policy

04:31.004 --> 04:33.406
on the definition of a buck deer.

04:33.439 --> 04:35.341
You got a call from Nolan Holt this morning,

04:35.341 --> 04:38.011
and your sponsor left another message.

04:38.011 --> 04:40.113
He wants you to call him back.

04:41.180 --> 04:42.115
- What'd Nolan want?

04:42.148 --> 04:43.182
- He didn't say.

04:43.182 --> 04:45.184
It sounded important, though.

04:45.184 --> 04:46.686
- How so?

04:46.753 --> 04:48.755
- When I told him you were otherwise indisposed,

04:48.755 --> 04:53.092
he asked that you hurry every chance you get.

04:56.596 --> 04:58.931
- Call the mayor, reschedule for lunch tomorrow.

04:58.931 --> 05:00.300
- Mm-hmm. - What's the name

05:00.333 --> 05:02.168
of that seafood place he likes?

05:02.168 --> 05:03.336
- Oceaner?

05:03.369 --> 05:04.203
- That's the one.

05:05.371 --> 05:06.706
- Make sure they bring out those hush puppies.

05:06.706 --> 05:08.107
- Mm-hmm. - He likes those.

05:09.542 --> 05:11.944
After that, call Fish and Game, tell them anything

05:11.978 --> 05:13.179
with a hard antler protruding through the skin

05:13.179 --> 05:15.481
is a buck deer, same as last season

05:15.515 --> 05:17.517
and the hundreds of seasons before that.

05:18.351 --> 05:19.819
- And your sponsor?

05:21.287 --> 05:22.121
- Forget it.

05:23.022 --> 05:23.990
- [Reema] You sure?

05:25.391 --> 05:26.225
- I'm busy.

05:27.293 --> 05:28.294
- Mm-hmm.

05:29.829 --> 05:30.997
And Nolan?

05:32.965 --> 05:34.467
- I'll handle that one myself.

05:36.069 --> 05:38.571
(phone rings)

05:41.407 --> 05:43.209
You gonna get that?

05:43.209 --> 05:44.477
- You know, one of these days,

05:44.510 --> 05:46.479
that thermos is going to catch up with you.

05:48.815 --> 05:50.016
- Well, lucky for you, you'll be here

05:50.049 --> 05:51.250
to tell me I told you so.

05:52.418 --> 05:53.686
- The worst time to hear I told you so

05:53.720 --> 05:55.855
is when you ended up saying it to yourself.

05:56.723 --> 05:58.725
(phone rings)

05:58.725 --> 05:59.659
- Thanks, Reema.

06:05.064 --> 06:06.099
- [Reema] Hello? Yes.

06:08.267 --> 06:10.770
(birds chirping)

06:10.837 --> 06:13.539
(truck rumbling)

06:18.711 --> 06:21.547
(engine rumbling)

06:26.419 --> 06:29.422
(metallic clacking)

06:31.891 --> 06:34.627
(door bangs)

06:34.627 --> 06:36.095
- What's up, partner?

06:36.095 --> 06:36.929
- Hey, Nolan.

06:44.036 --> 06:46.205
So, what'd you wanna show me?

06:46.205 --> 06:48.040
What's the phone call about?

06:48.074 --> 06:49.909
- (chuckles) Check it out.

06:54.580 --> 06:55.415
Whoo-whee.

06:59.652 --> 07:03.956
- Nolan, why is there a shark in the back of your truck?

07:03.956 --> 07:05.758
- [Nolan] Isn't she a beauty?

07:05.792 --> 07:08.161
- That's not what I asked. Where'd you get this?

07:09.762 --> 07:11.931
- Went and got it in Surf City,

07:11.931 --> 07:13.633
me and my buddy were out fishing.

07:13.633 --> 07:14.734
Got 'em something big.

07:15.635 --> 07:16.636
It's crazy.

07:19.305 --> 07:20.339
- Why do you have it?

07:21.274 --> 07:22.275
- Why do I have it?

07:23.242 --> 07:25.578
Why do you think I have it, son?

07:25.578 --> 07:26.446
I'm gonna sell it.

07:27.647 --> 07:28.581
- You're going to sell it?

07:28.614 --> 07:29.982
- Yeah.

07:29.982 --> 07:32.652
You know, the teeth, jawbone.

07:34.187 --> 07:37.023
Sometimes people like to eat the fin and shit.

07:37.089 --> 07:38.791
I'll make a killing.

07:38.825 --> 07:39.659
Great.

07:39.659 --> 07:40.626
- It's fucking bloated.

07:41.494 --> 07:42.762
Are you sure it's-

07:42.795 --> 07:45.531
- Stop stirring shit, don't worry about it.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.300
- All right, all right.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.134
Cut that shit out.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.972
You gotta get this thing out of here.

07:52.972 --> 07:54.807
Take it back where it came from.

07:54.841 --> 07:55.641
- Why?

07:57.176 --> 07:59.679
- Because this is a small town, Nolan.

07:59.679 --> 08:02.448
Once word gets out, you got a dead shark near the lake?

08:02.482 --> 08:04.817
People are going to equate all this to sharks

08:04.817 --> 08:06.285
being in the water.

08:06.285 --> 08:08.187
- That don't make any sense.

08:08.187 --> 08:10.857
Everybody knows that no sharks swim in freshwater.

08:10.890 --> 08:12.391
- It's the perception, Nolan.

08:12.458 --> 08:14.660
I don't need to explain that to you. Just do what I ask.

08:14.694 --> 08:16.295
I want this thing back in Surf City today.

08:16.295 --> 08:18.231
You got it? - Goddamn, man.

08:21.701 --> 08:23.336
Well, can I keep a fin at least?

08:23.336 --> 08:24.704
- Get your ass on the road now.

08:24.704 --> 08:25.705
- A tooth? - Do it!

08:27.573 --> 08:29.242
You piss me off. - Goddamn it.

08:30.710 --> 08:32.378
I knew I shouldn't have brought it here in the first place.

08:33.880 --> 08:36.082
(truck beeping)

08:36.148 --> 08:38.417
(doors bang)

08:38.417 --> 08:41.254
(water splashing)

08:51.764 --> 08:54.367
(door bangs)

08:54.400 --> 08:56.736
- Hey! What the hell you doing?

08:56.736 --> 08:59.772
You can't just come in here unannounced, Gary.

08:59.772 --> 09:01.440
- Unannounced?

09:01.440 --> 09:02.875
I call your cell, you don't answer.

09:02.909 --> 09:04.710
Your office, no call back.

09:04.710 --> 09:07.113
I mean, seriously, do you even get my messages?

09:08.781 --> 09:11.117
Besides, you always leave key outside

09:11.183 --> 09:12.351
in case you go AWOL.

09:15.121 --> 09:17.456
- Did it ever occur to you I might just be busy?

09:19.058 --> 09:21.127
- Don't bullshit a bullshitter, man.

09:21.127 --> 09:23.629
(tense music)

09:25.064 --> 09:28.067
(metallic rattling)

09:29.869 --> 09:32.038
You were coming up on 100 days.

09:35.441 --> 09:38.945
- I had shit with work, Gary, Dottie and the kid.

09:40.913 --> 09:42.715
- And this is how you get them back?

09:43.816 --> 09:45.651
They don't have room for an addict.

09:45.718 --> 09:47.887
And from what you've told me,

09:47.920 --> 09:49.722
they've made that pretty damn clear.

09:54.460 --> 09:56.662
When's the last time you actually ate something?

10:00.399 --> 10:04.136
You know, if you keep facing in the right direction,

10:04.136 --> 10:05.805
this thing's really pretty simple,

10:06.739 --> 10:08.174
but you've gotta keep walking.

10:12.745 --> 10:13.813
- I'm trying, Gary.

10:15.348 --> 10:16.515
I should've called you.

10:19.085 --> 10:22.088
- Well, have you seen her? The kiddo?

10:24.924 --> 10:26.092
- It's been three weeks.

10:28.361 --> 10:29.528
I don't know.

10:29.595 --> 10:31.430
I drove by the house the other night.

10:34.600 --> 10:37.637
- Well, look, I'm here to help,

10:38.838 --> 10:40.272
and I'm a hell of a good listener.

10:41.807 --> 10:42.975
I'll put on some coffee.

10:46.012 --> 10:46.812
- Thanks, Gary.

10:52.284 --> 10:56.455
(line whirring) - Catching anything?

10:56.455 --> 10:57.623
- Not a damn thing.

10:59.625 --> 11:00.359
What's in it?

11:01.193 --> 11:02.028
- Coffee.

11:04.063 --> 11:06.799
(birds chirping)

11:08.134 --> 11:10.069
- Ah, shit. - You got a license

11:10.069 --> 11:10.903
to fish out here?

11:12.838 --> 11:15.007
- That's none of your damn business, Gary.

11:15.041 --> 11:16.342
(Gary laughs)

11:16.342 --> 11:18.177
Just worry about taking care of me.

11:18.177 --> 11:19.979
- That's a full-time job.

11:21.247 --> 11:22.314
- I bet it is.

11:22.348 --> 11:23.716
I appreciate you either way.

11:24.917 --> 11:27.019
- [Gary] You can do this deal, brother.

11:27.053 --> 11:28.087
One day at a time.

11:31.524 --> 11:32.925
- Did you ever slip up?

11:32.925 --> 11:35.261
- I did, several times.

11:39.565 --> 11:41.567
Hey, you know what?

11:41.567 --> 11:43.035
I wouldn't trade this way of life,

11:43.069 --> 11:45.571
and I wouldn't trade my sobriety for anything in the world.

11:49.675 --> 11:52.344
(line whirring) You'll get there.

11:52.378 --> 11:57.349
- Yeah. (somber music)

12:00.286 --> 12:03.222
(metallic rattling)

12:11.764 --> 12:14.467
(Spencer coughs)

12:20.139 --> 12:23.309
(melancholy music)

12:23.375 --> 12:26.078
(water rippling)

12:33.119 --> 12:36.088
- Oh, I shit my pants. (grunts)

12:42.962 --> 12:46.966
If he thinks I'm driving back down south,

12:46.966 --> 12:49.468
he got another thing coming. (grunts)

12:52.638 --> 12:53.439
Whoo.

12:55.174 --> 13:00.112
Man, you're a heavy son of a bitch. (sighs)

13:03.149 --> 13:06.519
Here you go, Betsy, into the water.

13:06.519 --> 13:07.753
There.

13:07.787 --> 13:12.792
(water splashing) (Nolan grunts)

13:16.462 --> 13:17.296
8:30.

13:19.331 --> 13:20.166
Here.

13:22.001 --> 13:22.835
There.

13:24.170 --> 13:27.940
(tense music) (plane engines whirring)

13:27.940 --> 13:30.609
(Nolan humming)

13:41.854 --> 13:43.489
(water splashing)

13:43.522 --> 13:46.025
(tense music)

13:56.669 --> 14:00.339
(tense, eerie music)

14:00.339 --> 14:03.042
(birds chirping)

14:08.047 --> 14:11.250
(water splashing)

14:11.317 --> 14:13.719
(seagulls cawing)

14:13.719 --> 14:17.256
(eerie, suspenseful music)

14:21.227 --> 14:25.231
(creatures warbling underwater)

14:26.899 --> 14:29.401
(tense music)

14:31.437 --> 14:34.540
(suspenseful, eerie music)

14:34.573 --> 14:36.675
(woman yells) (dramatic music)

14:36.675 --> 14:38.210
(woman screaming)

14:38.244 --> 14:41.080
(water splashing)

14:45.784 --> 14:48.287
(tense music)

14:51.056 --> 14:54.059
(crickets chirping)

14:57.863 --> 15:00.566
(birds chirping)

15:02.768 --> 15:03.769
(Reema clears throat)

15:03.769 --> 15:05.704
- It's just coffee today, Reema.

15:05.704 --> 15:07.206
Lunch with the mayor went well.

15:09.041 --> 15:10.376
What's that look? What?

15:10.409 --> 15:11.377
What?

15:11.377 --> 15:13.078
- The sheriff's here to see you.

15:14.780 --> 15:15.614
- Send him in.

15:18.150 --> 15:18.984
- [Reema] Oh.

15:25.424 --> 15:26.325
- [Spencer] Wilson.

15:27.993 --> 15:28.827
- Spencer.

15:30.262 --> 15:31.263
- What can I do for?

15:32.598 --> 15:34.733
- [Sheriff] You hadn't heard?

15:34.733 --> 15:35.834
- [Spencer] Heard what?

15:36.769 --> 15:38.270
- Got a dead girl on the lake.

15:42.975 --> 15:43.909
- Where's the body?

15:45.144 --> 15:48.280
- What's left of it, coroner's office.

15:49.481 --> 15:50.983
There's a bunch of boats in the water

15:50.983 --> 15:52.618
a couple of miles up the coast from where we found the girl,

15:52.651 --> 15:54.954
I sent a couple of my guys up there to bring them in.

15:56.121 --> 15:56.956
- What'd you tell them?

15:56.956 --> 15:58.123
- Lake water tests.

15:59.325 --> 16:00.426
Figure that'd give us some time to figure out

16:00.426 --> 16:01.593
what we're going to say.

16:02.861 --> 16:04.129
- We?

16:04.163 --> 16:06.999
- We hadn't had a murder in this town in 60 years

16:06.999 --> 16:10.102
and now, in a goddamn election year?

16:10.102 --> 16:10.970
You're the warden.

16:12.004 --> 16:13.839
I deal with criminals.

16:13.839 --> 16:15.040
You deal with animals.

16:16.508 --> 16:19.044
- Well, Sheriff, I think I deal with more criminals

16:19.111 --> 16:20.646
in this town than you do.

16:22.848 --> 16:24.350
What makes you think it's an animal?

16:24.350 --> 16:27.686
(Sheriff Wilson scoffs)

16:29.021 --> 16:31.523
(tense music)

16:36.462 --> 16:39.164
- They pulled that out of the middle of her back,

16:39.198 --> 16:41.000
lodged into her spine.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.534
Yeah, that's a shark tooth.

16:45.871 --> 16:47.072
- Impossible.

16:47.072 --> 16:48.340
- Listen, I don't wanna cause a panic

16:48.374 --> 16:50.075
in town with the locals.

16:50.075 --> 16:51.310
Word gets out we got a shark in the lake,

16:51.343 --> 16:53.212
you can forget all about tourists.

16:55.314 --> 16:57.850
- Sheriff, if there were a shark in these waters,

16:57.883 --> 17:00.819
as rare as that would be, the chances of attacking

17:00.819 --> 17:04.056
and killing a swimmer like that doesn't add up.

17:05.057 --> 17:06.658
They don't come into freshwater.

17:07.559 --> 17:08.727
We don't have reefs.

17:09.661 --> 17:10.829
Slaughterhouses? No.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.199
Nothing here to keep them interested.

17:14.233 --> 17:15.501
- All right, then.

17:18.237 --> 17:19.071
Game warden,

17:22.574 --> 17:24.743
how'd a shark end up in my lake?

17:24.743 --> 17:25.611
- [Spencer] Nolan!

17:28.914 --> 17:29.848
- Warden?

17:29.848 --> 17:31.350
- Warden, my ass. What'd you do?

17:32.251 --> 17:33.685
- About what?

17:33.685 --> 17:35.254
- The other day, a little package in the back

17:35.254 --> 17:37.589
of your truck, what did you do?

17:37.623 --> 17:39.625
- Shit, man, I didn't know you meant it.

17:41.627 --> 17:43.062
- What'd you do with it, Nolan?

17:44.363 --> 17:46.098
- I dumped it by the lake.

17:46.098 --> 17:47.266
By the campground. Why?

17:48.300 --> 17:49.401
- You dumped it in the lake.

17:49.435 --> 17:50.702
- Yeah.

17:50.702 --> 17:52.371
I'm sorry, I just didn't wanna make another trip.

17:52.404 --> 17:53.238
That's all.

17:54.907 --> 17:55.741
Damn.

17:56.642 --> 17:58.577
- You told me it was dead, Nolan.

17:58.610 --> 17:59.445
You swore to me.

17:59.445 --> 18:00.446
- It was dead.

18:00.446 --> 18:01.980
I even poked it with a stick.

18:02.047 --> 18:02.881
You saw it.

18:05.317 --> 18:08.153
Wait.

18:08.220 --> 18:10.422
What you trying to say here, huh?

18:10.456 --> 18:11.890
- A young girl's dead, Nolan.

18:13.492 --> 18:14.760
- Huh?

18:14.793 --> 18:15.594
- The shark was alive when you put it back-

18:15.594 --> 18:17.396
- There's no way.

18:17.396 --> 18:19.498
It didn't move for 10 hours.

18:19.498 --> 18:21.166
- What about the one inside it, hmm?

18:21.166 --> 18:23.001
I told you it looked fucking bloated.

18:23.068 --> 18:24.603
- Get the fuck outta here, man.

18:24.636 --> 18:25.804
You telling me it was knocked up?

18:25.804 --> 18:27.139
- You got a better suggestion?

18:27.139 --> 18:29.641
(tense music)

18:34.279 --> 18:36.115
- What you want me to do?

18:36.115 --> 18:37.516
I mean, I didn't do anything.

18:39.118 --> 18:39.952
I mean...

18:40.986 --> 18:41.920
I didn't do anything, man.

18:41.920 --> 18:44.189
You saw it was dead. You saw it.

18:44.189 --> 18:46.024
I poked it with a stick. You saw it, man.

18:46.091 --> 18:47.426
Right?

18:47.426 --> 18:48.927
- Save it for the sheriff, Nolan.

18:57.703 --> 18:59.204
- It was dead.

18:59.271 --> 19:00.439
I poked it with a stick.

19:04.209 --> 19:05.210
Right, with a stick.

19:08.614 --> 19:11.450
(sighs) I need a beer.

19:11.450 --> 19:12.718
(birds chirping)

19:12.718 --> 19:16.021
(water warbling)

19:16.021 --> 19:18.524
(eerie music)

19:30.836 --> 19:33.539
(truck rumbling)

19:58.730 --> 20:00.232
- So do you even have to go to the academy

20:00.265 --> 20:01.600
to be a game warden?

20:05.837 --> 20:08.006
- About 31 weeks, asshole.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.007
- Hmm.

20:11.076 --> 20:13.745
(door creaking)

20:15.047 --> 20:16.215
- Right on time, fellas.

20:18.083 --> 20:19.918
We're in the middle of my lunch hour.

20:21.753 --> 20:26.758
So. (crunching)

20:27.926 --> 20:30.295
At first, I thought that a shark in lake water

20:30.362 --> 20:33.699
didn't make any sense, but I did my research.

20:33.699 --> 20:36.868
Come to find out, it's not as uncommon as you might think.

20:38.370 --> 20:43.041
Louisiana, Mississippi, even parts of the Texas coast,

20:43.942 --> 20:45.444
but never this far up, though.

20:45.444 --> 20:46.245
- Is it dead?

20:47.446 --> 20:48.914
- Excuse me?

20:48.947 --> 20:50.716
- [Sheriff] The shark. Is it dead?

20:51.783 --> 20:54.152
- Hmm. Which one?

20:54.219 --> 20:55.721
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:55.754 --> 20:56.922
What do you mean, which one?

20:58.257 --> 20:59.057
- Look here.

21:02.427 --> 21:04.730
You see the bite ratio here on her lower back?

21:06.131 --> 21:08.333
I called a friend of mine down at the Ocean Institute

21:08.400 --> 21:10.636
and I had them take a look at the measurements.

21:11.803 --> 21:13.472
Come to find out those teeth markings

21:14.506 --> 21:15.974
are from a younger shark.

21:15.974 --> 21:17.909
You know the tooth you found in her back?

21:17.943 --> 21:20.279
It broke off like that because the shark's jawline

21:20.312 --> 21:23.248
is still developing. (crunching)

21:25.317 --> 21:27.686
- What am I supposed to tell that girl's family?

21:27.753 --> 21:28.920
- Nevermind that.

21:28.954 --> 21:30.622
So what you're saying is not one,

21:30.622 --> 21:32.624
but two sharks in our lake?

21:32.658 --> 21:35.661
- Well, unless this adolescent shark got lost at sea,

21:35.661 --> 21:38.096
I can almost bet the mama shark's out there with him.

21:39.331 --> 21:40.499
- Son of a bitch.

21:42.134 --> 21:44.469
- Look, gentlemen, you're interrupting my lunch,

21:44.469 --> 21:46.471
and at the end of the day, I need to be honest

21:46.505 --> 21:47.839
with my cause of death here.

21:50.175 --> 21:52.311
This girl was killed by a shark attack.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.846
And how that happened, that's your jobs to figure out.

21:56.048 --> 21:57.049
- How long can we keep this quiet?

21:57.115 --> 21:59.985
- A few days, if we're lucky.

22:00.018 --> 22:01.520
- This friend of yours at the Institute,

22:01.520 --> 22:03.855
you have his number, in case I have any questions?

22:08.527 --> 22:11.129
- Right there. (crunches)

22:14.866 --> 22:15.701
Good luck.

22:17.302 --> 22:20.205
(people chattering)

22:20.205 --> 22:22.040
- No, no, no, that's not what I said.

22:23.709 --> 22:24.843
No, what I said was I didn't wanna

22:24.876 --> 22:26.511
make a comment at this time,

22:26.511 --> 22:28.347
and legally that's all you can print.

22:29.548 --> 22:30.749
Harry, hold on a second.

22:30.749 --> 22:32.250
Hey, you got the mayor on the line?

22:34.186 --> 22:35.420
Harry, yeah, it's the mayor's office.

22:35.420 --> 22:36.521
I gotta call you back.

22:36.555 --> 22:38.256
Don't print anything. You hear me?

22:41.093 --> 22:41.927
Mr. Mayor.

22:43.395 --> 22:44.229
Yes, sir.

22:45.731 --> 22:49.668
Yes, sir, I have a call into the Ocean Institute as well.

22:49.701 --> 22:50.502
When?

22:51.937 --> 22:53.205
All right.

22:53.238 --> 22:54.373
I should be getting a call any minute now.

22:54.373 --> 22:55.374
Reema.

22:55.374 --> 22:56.942
Reema!

22:56.942 --> 22:58.744
That the (indistinct) guy from Port Aransas?

22:58.744 --> 22:59.544
- Line 2.

23:00.412 --> 23:01.913
- Mr. Mayor?

23:01.913 --> 23:04.950
Yes, my assistant just let me know our guy's on hold.

23:05.016 --> 23:06.218
Will do. You got my word.

23:07.953 --> 23:11.590
If you could keep the paper off my back, I'd appreciate it

23:11.590 --> 23:13.258
till we figure this whole thing out.

23:14.126 --> 23:15.627
Yes, sir. Talk to you soon.

23:16.762 --> 23:19.431
What line's the guy from Port A?

23:19.431 --> 23:20.599
- Line 2.

23:23.101 --> 23:24.936
- Goddamn it, there's nobody there.

23:24.936 --> 23:25.804
- Well, he hung up.

23:25.871 --> 23:26.772
Should I call him back?

23:26.772 --> 23:28.273
- Yeah. Right now, please.

23:31.209 --> 23:32.878
If the paper calls back, tell Harry to call

23:32.878 --> 23:35.113
the mayor's office. If he wants a statement, okay?

23:35.113 --> 23:35.947
- Okay.

23:37.315 --> 23:38.483
(phone buzzes) - Goddamn it.

23:39.951 --> 23:42.120
Gary, now's not a good time, my friend.

23:49.227 --> 23:50.061
Yeah.

23:50.061 --> 23:51.263
Yeah, no, it's not that.

23:51.296 --> 23:52.497
I appreciate you checking in on me.

23:52.497 --> 23:53.832
I just got a lot going on at work right now

23:53.832 --> 23:55.133
and I gotta call you back.

23:57.836 --> 23:58.637
This is Timms.

24:00.105 --> 24:02.107
Yes, yes, thank you for calling me back so quickly.

24:04.910 --> 24:07.245
Great, so you understand our situation up here.

24:10.015 --> 24:11.183
Okay. Wait, wait.

24:11.249 --> 24:12.484
Say that last part again.

24:17.522 --> 24:19.324
How could you possibly know all that?

24:21.426 --> 24:22.861
All right, I'll be there tonight.

24:22.861 --> 24:23.695
Thank you.

24:25.263 --> 24:26.932
- Nolan Holt is on line 1.

24:28.366 --> 24:30.168
- Go fuck yourself, Nolan.

24:30.168 --> 24:31.703
- Now was that necessary?

24:34.473 --> 24:36.174
Where do you think you're going?

24:36.174 --> 24:38.343
- Port Aransas. - Now?

24:38.376 --> 24:39.811
That's a seven hour drive.

24:41.213 --> 24:42.047
- It's important.

24:43.515 --> 24:46.151
Have the sheriff meet me at the north dock at 7:00 AM.

24:46.151 --> 24:47.853
Anybody else calls, send them to the mayor's office

24:47.853 --> 24:50.322
till I get back and keep your cell phone on.

24:50.355 --> 24:53.058
- Are you gonna tell me what the hell is going on here?

24:55.827 --> 24:56.661
- Not right now.

24:58.797 --> 25:00.131
(Reema sighs)

25:00.131 --> 25:05.036
(eerie music) (water warbling)

25:11.810 --> 25:13.512
How the hell's everybody have a key to this place?

25:13.545 --> 25:17.382
- 'Cause you're not answering your phone.

25:17.382 --> 25:18.583
- Got a lot going on.

25:20.652 --> 25:21.653
- I can see that.

25:24.890 --> 25:25.891
- It's not like that.

25:25.891 --> 25:26.725
- Okay.

25:32.664 --> 25:33.498
- What's this?

25:34.399 --> 25:36.167
- You know what it is, Spencer.

25:36.201 --> 25:39.104
(melancholy music)

25:44.109 --> 25:45.243
- I'm not signing that.

25:46.411 --> 25:48.613
- You don't really have a choice.

25:51.249 --> 25:54.786
- You come into my house with divorce papers

25:56.054 --> 25:56.955
and you won't even let me see him?

25:56.955 --> 25:59.791
- And whose fault is that?

25:59.858 --> 26:01.793
You remember your little episode at the courthouse.

26:01.793 --> 26:02.961
- He's my son, too.

26:05.463 --> 26:09.467
And you, you are holding him hostage from me.

26:09.467 --> 26:11.469
- (sighs) How dare you?

26:12.704 --> 26:14.773
I have done nothing but give you chances

26:14.773 --> 26:16.441
to have some sort of relationship with him

26:16.474 --> 26:19.978
and you've done nothing but shit all over it.

26:20.045 --> 26:22.948
How many times have you shown up drunk or hungover?

26:22.948 --> 26:24.883
How many times can you cancel on him

26:24.916 --> 26:27.285
before he starts to think you don't give a shit?

26:30.488 --> 26:35.060
(sighs) Just don't put that on me.

26:37.662 --> 26:38.563
- All right, fine.

26:41.333 --> 26:43.168
But I'm not signing this, not yet.

26:44.469 --> 26:45.804
You are still my wife.

26:47.339 --> 26:48.273
We're gonna work through all of this.

26:48.306 --> 26:49.808
We're gonna be a family again.

26:51.276 --> 26:54.946
(melancholy music)

26:54.946 --> 26:58.850
- When you were young, I loved who you were.

27:01.152 --> 27:03.321
Now, I don't know this guy.

27:06.758 --> 27:07.592
And that,

27:09.628 --> 27:11.296
that hurts the worst.

27:15.200 --> 27:16.368
Sign the papers.

27:17.535 --> 27:19.371
It's what's best for all three of us.

27:21.973 --> 27:22.974
Enjoy your drink.

27:24.209 --> 27:25.377
- It's not what's best.

27:28.513 --> 27:29.948
Can we talk about this?

27:31.983 --> 27:34.486
(door closes)

27:37.989 --> 27:40.692
(paper rustling)

27:43.161 --> 27:46.197
(Spencer gulping)

27:46.197 --> 27:47.532
Goddamn it, Spencer.

27:53.538 --> 27:55.974
(man grunts)

27:57.509 --> 28:00.011
(can popping)

28:06.418 --> 28:09.254
(water splashing)

28:23.935 --> 28:28.773
- (laughs) That's a good one right there.

28:36.381 --> 28:39.918
(insect buzzing)

28:39.918 --> 28:42.420
(tense music)

28:43.722 --> 28:46.458
(water gurgling)

28:52.597 --> 28:55.433
(water splashing)

28:56.601 --> 28:58.203
(music intensifies)

28:58.203 --> 29:03.108
(dramatic music) (water splashing)

29:04.442 --> 29:09.447
(man gurgling) (water splashing)

29:10.782 --> 29:13.284
(tense music)

29:16.454 --> 29:19.224
(water warbling)

29:22.627 --> 29:25.463
(water splashing)

29:28.133 --> 29:31.069
(melancholy music)

29:33.471 --> 29:36.808
(truck rumbling)

29:36.808 --> 29:39.144
(seagulls cawing)

29:39.144 --> 29:41.646
(tense music)

29:50.121 --> 29:52.857
- Frankfort, Michigan three years ago,

29:54.292 --> 29:56.528
and that's not the first one I've heard about in freshwater.

29:58.830 --> 29:59.831
I know.

29:59.831 --> 30:01.332
The chances of winning a lottery

30:01.332 --> 30:04.335
or a meteorite falling from the sky

30:04.335 --> 30:07.038
seem more likely than finding a shark in the Great Lakes,

30:07.038 --> 30:09.707
but there are more than 100 eyewitness accounts

30:09.707 --> 30:11.442
of sharks swimming up the Mississippi

30:11.476 --> 30:12.811
as far up as Illinois.

30:16.014 --> 30:18.817
Given the distance between the Gulf of Mexico

30:20.285 --> 30:22.220
and Lake Michigan, I have to suggest that if a shark

30:22.220 --> 30:25.123
with an extreme case of wanderlust could make it

30:25.156 --> 30:27.225
up to the Illinois River, it could surely make it

30:27.225 --> 30:29.661
a third of the way and end up in your backyard.

30:31.462 --> 30:35.967
See, the unique trick is that bull sharks have kidneys

30:35.967 --> 30:38.336
that recycle the salt vital to the animal cells.

30:39.704 --> 30:42.173
Normally, a different freshwater would dilute the salt,

30:42.173 --> 30:44.242
causing the cells to rupture, kill it.

30:46.177 --> 30:47.045
Not the bull shark.

30:48.880 --> 30:49.714
- [Spencer] Great.

30:53.852 --> 30:55.019
- I see this a lot.

30:56.554 --> 30:59.691
When people read magazine articles on shark attacks,

30:59.691 --> 31:02.894
or they turn on the History Channel for one week a year,

31:02.894 --> 31:06.164
suddenly, everyone becomes an expert, but Warden,

31:06.197 --> 31:10.235
Texas, Michigan, Mississippi, the Amazon.

31:13.571 --> 31:16.241
When Hamlin called me, I took a look at what she had.

31:19.911 --> 31:20.712
See this?

31:22.113 --> 31:24.782
The size and depth of these wounds matches that

31:24.782 --> 31:27.285
of only one species.

31:27.352 --> 31:32.023
This isn't a trick of the sun or waves or too much alcohol.

31:32.056 --> 31:34.259
What you're dealing with is a shark,

31:34.259 --> 31:36.527
and from the looks of it, a hungry one.

31:41.232 --> 31:42.600
Now there is some good news.

31:44.369 --> 31:47.538
With the lack of any salt water or appropriate food,

31:47.572 --> 31:50.241
and with the colder temperatures coming,

31:50.275 --> 31:52.110
I think this shark problem

31:52.110 --> 31:53.945
is not gonna last you too much longer.

31:57.148 --> 31:59.817
As long as you've closed the lake, I think the shark thing

31:59.817 --> 32:01.953
is gonna go away pretty quickly.

32:06.624 --> 32:09.160
You did close the lake, right?

32:09.227 --> 32:14.232
(tense music) (water splashing)

32:17.068 --> 32:19.771
(engine revving)

32:24.008 --> 32:29.013
(fishing rod clicking) (birds chirping)

32:33.251 --> 32:36.087
(water splashing)

32:43.628 --> 32:46.130
(tense music)

32:48.099 --> 32:50.835
(paper rustling)

32:55.873 --> 32:57.175
Mr. Mayor.

32:57.175 --> 32:59.310
- Mr. Harper, glad I could catch you.

32:59.344 --> 33:00.211
Is this a bad time?

33:02.714 --> 33:03.648
- Who's this?

33:05.183 --> 33:07.518
- She's with me. Legal counsel.

33:08.519 --> 33:09.354
May I?

33:17.862 --> 33:20.198
About this problem, this little problem we've got

33:20.198 --> 33:23.701
with our lake up north, Coroner Hamlin,

33:25.169 --> 33:27.872
she was up here to speak with you, was she not?

33:30.708 --> 33:31.542
- She did.

33:32.877 --> 33:35.346
- And the game warden, he came down here

33:35.346 --> 33:36.347
and paid you a visit.

33:38.216 --> 33:39.550
- That's right.

33:39.550 --> 33:41.519
He left just about an hour ago.

33:42.587 --> 33:44.655
Look, Mr. Mayor, whatever you wanna know,

33:44.689 --> 33:47.258
I can assure you that I've briefed your game warden.

33:51.729 --> 33:53.564
- You know what? I love to fish.

33:53.598 --> 33:56.267
I once caught a marlin off the Florida Keys.

33:57.435 --> 33:59.771
Came in at eight feet long, 200 pounds.

33:59.771 --> 34:02.607
Took me two hours to reel him in.

34:04.075 --> 34:07.245
Now I know you told Spencer we got a shark in our waters.

34:08.413 --> 34:11.582
Personally, if it was the family of marlins

34:11.582 --> 34:14.352
that wanted to populate the lake, I'd say, bring them on.

34:14.385 --> 34:15.553
I want a rematch.

34:15.553 --> 34:17.555
- But we're not talking about marlins.

34:17.555 --> 34:18.956
That would be impossible.

34:18.956 --> 34:20.591
We're talking about a shark.

34:26.097 --> 34:27.632
- A bull shark.

34:27.632 --> 34:29.200
- That's right.

34:29.233 --> 34:31.369
I've given the game warden the report.

34:31.369 --> 34:34.872
Amputated arms and legs, the bites aren't hard to find.

34:37.275 --> 34:38.276
Take a look at this.

34:44.315 --> 34:45.950
(tense music) - Whoo!

34:45.950 --> 34:47.452
- This is six months ago,

34:47.452 --> 34:49.620
three states north of where you are.

34:51.656 --> 34:53.724
- Watch out, watch out. - Whoa, hold on.

34:55.460 --> 34:57.895
- Whoo. - Watch out.

34:57.929 --> 35:00.231
- Whoo. My gosh.

35:03.768 --> 35:05.770
Hold on to that thing.

35:05.803 --> 35:08.339
Whoo! - Bail some water here.

35:08.339 --> 35:09.173
- Oh my gosh.

35:10.975 --> 35:13.811
Look at his paw, look at his paw, oh my gosh.

35:13.811 --> 35:15.646
Dude, that's like a nine or 10 footer.

35:15.646 --> 35:16.981
That is not like seven.

35:17.915 --> 35:19.183
That's huge!

35:19.183 --> 35:19.984
Oh geez.

35:19.984 --> 35:21.119
Do you see that?

35:22.120 --> 35:24.956
(water splashing)

35:30.428 --> 35:31.529
I don't know.

35:31.529 --> 35:32.663
He attacked us.

35:33.631 --> 35:35.133
He literally attacked us.

35:36.601 --> 35:39.337
- What you're dealing here is a very real possibility.

35:39.337 --> 35:40.505
- [Man] Watch out.

35:40.505 --> 35:41.873
Whoo. Oh my gosh.

35:44.842 --> 35:46.444
Oh, hold on.

35:47.845 --> 35:51.883
- I wonder, does the board at the Ocean Institute

35:51.949 --> 35:56.521
share your conviction on this bull shark theory?

35:57.688 --> 36:00.691
- It's not a theory, it's a fact.

36:00.725 --> 36:04.028
- I doubt they'd be very happy to have a major hit

36:04.028 --> 36:06.697
in their funding because one of their mad scientists

36:06.731 --> 36:11.736
was spouting erroneous rumors about sharks

36:12.503 --> 36:13.504
in freshwater lakes.

36:19.210 --> 36:21.012
- I'm sorry. What are you getting at?

36:23.347 --> 36:26.684
- We are very powerful people, Mr. Harper.

36:31.155 --> 36:32.356
Would you do me a favor?

36:33.224 --> 36:34.559
Would you give us the room?

36:38.663 --> 36:42.033
(Jacob Harper shuffling)

36:50.708 --> 36:53.211
(door closes)

36:59.250 --> 37:00.084
So.

37:02.620 --> 37:04.121
- Could be a problem.

37:04.188 --> 37:07.291
- I am not paying you to state the obvious.

37:07.291 --> 37:09.427
What do we have in place for this?

37:09.427 --> 37:11.095
- Containment.

37:11.095 --> 37:13.564
13 men have run against you.

37:13.598 --> 37:15.633
They all thought they had a chance.

37:15.633 --> 37:16.534
They lost.

37:17.868 --> 37:20.871
We didn't get here by forgetting how we pay our rent.

37:20.905 --> 37:24.976
- And now I'm running up against a fucking shark.

37:24.976 --> 37:27.144
- Don't twist my words.

37:27.211 --> 37:29.280
I'm not saying we win.

37:29.280 --> 37:33.618
I'm saying we take out the story's legs, then its heart.

37:34.986 --> 37:36.988
- And how do we do that?

37:38.823 --> 37:40.091
- (sighs) Who else knows?

37:41.459 --> 37:43.628
(tense music)

37:43.628 --> 37:45.396
- [Mayor] The game warden.

37:45.429 --> 37:46.897
- The alcoholic?

37:46.897 --> 37:48.299
- What's that matter?

37:48.299 --> 37:49.900
- He's the easiest to discredit.

37:51.602 --> 37:52.436
The sheriff?

37:53.604 --> 37:55.106
- He's not a problem. Trust me.

37:56.274 --> 37:58.075
He wants this quiet as much as I do.

37:59.810 --> 38:00.611
- Okay.

38:01.979 --> 38:05.483
We keep the victims' families quiet a little bit longer

38:05.483 --> 38:08.152
until we can draft something up on our side.

38:08.152 --> 38:11.689
Anyone talks, we know the weakest link.

38:11.756 --> 38:15.626
All we have to do is cut him loose and you look like a hero.

38:16.827 --> 38:19.964
- Okay.

38:19.964 --> 38:21.132
- All right then.

38:21.132 --> 38:23.434
The pieces are all on the board

38:23.434 --> 38:27.204
unless there's anyone else who knows about your problem?

38:27.204 --> 38:30.508
(tense music)

38:30.508 --> 38:31.342
- Mm.

38:33.177 --> 38:35.946
(paper rustling)

38:45.990 --> 38:49.160
(tense music)

38:49.193 --> 38:50.828
(door shuts)

38:50.828 --> 38:53.497
- Don't turn around, stay calm.

38:55.232 --> 38:57.168
This is simply two civil servants

38:57.201 --> 38:59.136
having a friendly conversation.

39:06.043 --> 39:08.546
There are so many kinds of bravery in this world.

39:10.381 --> 39:13.517
Sometimes, bravery means laying down your life

39:13.517 --> 39:16.987
for something bigger than yourself or for someone else.

39:16.987 --> 39:19.056
(Coroner Hamlin chomps on apple)

39:19.056 --> 39:23.394
Sometimes, it means giving up everything you've ever known,

39:23.394 --> 39:24.829
everything you've ever loved

39:26.530 --> 39:28.199
for the sake of something greater.

39:29.500 --> 39:30.568
Sometimes, it doesn't.

39:32.036 --> 39:36.273
Sometimes bravery simply means gritting your teeth

39:36.273 --> 39:41.278
through the pain, everyday work, slow walk to a better life,

39:43.047 --> 39:45.716
and doing what you're asked to do

39:47.084 --> 39:48.719
whether or not you agree with it.

39:53.391 --> 39:54.225
- Okay?

39:55.926 --> 39:56.727
Mr. Mayor.

39:58.095 --> 40:00.598
- I don't need you to say anything right now,

40:02.433 --> 40:04.635
but that last kind of bravery I talked about,

40:06.103 --> 40:08.572
that's the kind of bravery you're gonna need right now.

40:12.410 --> 40:14.879
(door opens)

40:14.879 --> 40:16.313
We'll be in touch.

40:16.313 --> 40:18.082
Y'all enjoy the rest of your lunch.

40:21.886 --> 40:24.288
(door shuts)

40:27.091 --> 40:30.327
(keys jingle)

40:30.327 --> 40:32.930
(car rumbling)

40:40.638 --> 40:43.507
(leaves crunching)

40:46.143 --> 40:48.245
(paper rustles)

40:48.279 --> 40:50.981
(birds chirping)

40:58.956 --> 41:03.627
(phone buzzes) - This is Hamlin.

41:03.661 --> 41:05.496
- [Sheriff] Don't think, just listen.

41:06.931 --> 41:08.132
You're gonna go back to your office this afternoon,

41:08.165 --> 41:10.267
and you're gonna file that dead girl's report.

41:11.469 --> 41:13.704
Only difference is, this time, when you file it,

41:15.206 --> 41:17.308
you're gonna leave the cause of death blank.

41:18.642 --> 41:19.477
Understood?

41:22.546 --> 41:23.380
Hamlin.

41:25.616 --> 41:29.487
- Yes, I understand. (sighs)

41:30.488 --> 41:31.322
Fuck.

41:34.024 --> 41:39.029
(tense music) (water warbling)

41:41.799 --> 41:44.001
(birds chirping)

41:44.034 --> 41:48.539
(children laughing) (children yelling)

41:48.539 --> 41:50.574
(water splashing)

41:50.574 --> 41:55.546
(tense music) (water warbling)

41:58.549 --> 42:01.385
(children laughing) (children yelling)

42:01.385 --> 42:04.088
(birds chirping)

42:06.223 --> 42:11.228
(ducks quacking) (tense music)

42:19.603 --> 42:22.439
(water splashing)

42:35.085 --> 42:40.090
(dog panting) (water splashing)

42:49.433 --> 42:51.902
(tense music)

42:55.039 --> 42:57.875
(person whistling)

43:00.044 --> 43:03.113
(dog panting)

43:03.113 --> 43:05.616
(tense music)

43:10.621 --> 43:14.892
(dog barks) (dog whimpering)

43:14.892 --> 43:17.728
(water splashing)

43:28.138 --> 43:30.641
(tense music)

43:47.024 --> 43:49.193
(Spencer coughs) (Spencer spits)

43:49.259 --> 43:50.027
- You're late.

43:53.030 --> 43:55.032
Have you even slept? You look like shit.

43:57.267 --> 44:00.270
- It's a bull shark. We need to close the lake down.

44:00.270 --> 44:02.606
- Bull shark? What makes you so sure?

44:03.707 --> 44:04.541
- Did you hear what I just said?

44:04.608 --> 44:05.809
- I heard you.

44:05.843 --> 44:06.810
But close down the lake?

44:06.810 --> 44:08.479
With the tourists coming in?

44:10.014 --> 44:12.149
You can't just wash those tax dollars away.

44:12.149 --> 44:14.485
I'm up for reelection in two and a half months.

44:15.686 --> 44:17.287
Can't handle that kind of action.

44:17.287 --> 44:19.123
- No, what you can't handle, Wilson,

44:19.123 --> 44:21.392
is a kid getting eaten by a shark.

44:21.392 --> 44:22.292
Can't afford that.

44:23.494 --> 44:24.995
- What are you not telling me?

44:26.330 --> 44:28.632
- The guy at the Ocean Institute, I went and saw him.

44:30.367 --> 44:32.036
Good news is mother sharks don't allow their young

44:32.036 --> 44:33.070
to hunt on their own.

44:34.538 --> 44:37.975
That, plus the size of the bite radius on the dead girl

44:39.176 --> 44:40.744
says we're looking at one shark, not two.

44:42.713 --> 44:45.215
- So what happened to the mother shark?

44:45.215 --> 44:47.518
- His best guess? Didn't survive the birth.

44:49.053 --> 44:51.722
So we've got one dead shark under water

44:51.722 --> 44:54.058
and another one looking for more meals

44:54.058 --> 44:55.225
and it's fucking hungry.

44:56.694 --> 44:58.362
- Did you run this past the mayor?

44:59.763 --> 45:01.198
- Just got in, Pete.

45:01.231 --> 45:02.266
First face I've seen.

45:04.068 --> 45:05.536
We need divers to confirm it.

45:06.704 --> 45:08.272
Otherwise, we trust the expert and assume

45:08.272 --> 45:11.275
if the shark is feeding, that it's got no other choice.

45:11.275 --> 45:12.109
Mother's dead.

45:15.412 --> 45:17.414
- We need to get on the boat.

45:17.448 --> 45:19.283
I can't keep that little girl's mother quiet much longer.

45:19.349 --> 45:21.118
- No, what you need to do is shut down the damn lake.

45:21.118 --> 45:22.619
Cut off its food supply.

45:22.686 --> 45:25.255
- We don't have to do that if we kill the damn thing first.

45:25.255 --> 45:26.957
Now I'm still the fucking sheriff in this town.

45:27.024 --> 45:28.959
Last time I checked, you answer to me.

45:31.795 --> 45:32.596
- Right.

45:33.864 --> 45:35.466
- All right.

45:35.466 --> 45:37.801
So go find us a boat and we'll go out there

45:37.801 --> 45:39.636
and kill this fucking thing.

45:39.636 --> 45:42.306
But we're gonna be real quiet about it, right?

45:43.741 --> 45:46.410
Nobody's gotta know about this but us.

45:46.443 --> 45:47.611
In the meantime, we'll stick

45:47.611 --> 45:49.446
with the whole water testing story.

45:51.115 --> 45:54.218
Hey, I do not want mass hysteria.

45:55.385 --> 45:57.054
You got me?

45:57.054 --> 45:58.055
- I got you.

46:00.557 --> 46:03.660
(footsteps shuffling)

46:19.309 --> 46:21.812
(tense music)

46:27.851 --> 46:30.521
(dock rattling)

46:32.356 --> 46:35.526
(gunshots blasting)

46:35.592 --> 46:38.095
(tense music)

46:41.331 --> 46:44.434
(gunshots blasting)

46:44.434 --> 46:45.702
(sheriff yells)

46:45.702 --> 46:48.972
(water splashes)

46:49.006 --> 46:51.675
(sheriff gasps)

46:53.110 --> 46:55.646
(tense music)

47:02.486 --> 47:05.155
(sheriff yells)

47:07.891 --> 47:10.828
(sheriff gurgling)

47:11.795 --> 47:14.298
(tense music)

47:15.532 --> 47:18.035
(eerie music)

47:21.839 --> 47:24.508
(phone ringing)

47:26.009 --> 47:27.511
- The mayor is here to see you.

47:31.882 --> 47:32.716
- Send him in.

47:37.721 --> 47:39.590
- Morbid, terrible shame.

47:40.724 --> 47:42.326
He's a good man.

47:42.359 --> 47:43.994
Gonna be hard to replace.

47:43.994 --> 47:44.828
- Thanks for coming.

47:44.862 --> 47:45.696
Have a seat.

47:50.434 --> 47:51.602
- Where'd you get that?

47:53.070 --> 47:54.238
- Deputy brought it in.

47:55.505 --> 47:57.841
He didn't know what else to do with it.

47:57.875 --> 48:00.210
- The lake is 31 miles long.

48:02.512 --> 48:03.513
- I understand that.

48:04.581 --> 48:06.416
If you allow me to call the harbor patrol.

48:06.450 --> 48:09.019
- No harbor patrol.

48:09.052 --> 48:10.520
Too much negative attention.

48:12.589 --> 48:15.392
You know, anybody can take the wheel of a ship

48:15.392 --> 48:19.263
in calm waters, but the waves get rough, not so easy.

48:20.697 --> 48:22.266
We can't just sit back and enjoy the good times.

48:22.266 --> 48:24.234
We've gotta stand tough through it all.

48:25.769 --> 48:27.604
- I appreciate the pep talk, but sir.

48:28.939 --> 48:30.974
- Not a pep talk, warden. That is a promise.

48:33.410 --> 48:36.980
This town has not seen a murder in more than half a century.

48:38.715 --> 48:41.118
A shark in these waters? That's unheard of.

48:42.286 --> 48:43.487
Sheriff Wilson's dead.

48:44.955 --> 48:47.224
I can deal with that end of the mess,

48:47.224 --> 48:50.494
but you gotta get a handle on this disaster

48:50.494 --> 48:52.296
and live up to your end of the deal.

48:54.231 --> 48:55.732
- Deal?

48:55.732 --> 48:58.568
- Do your fucking job so I can save mine.

48:59.903 --> 49:01.071
I need to know what you're gonna do

49:01.104 --> 49:02.973
about this shark problem.

49:05.275 --> 49:06.643
- I got a charter coming in.

49:08.111 --> 49:10.280
I asked Wilson to shut down the lake, but he refused.

49:12.015 --> 49:15.585
- We can shut down the lake without shutting down the lake.

49:15.619 --> 49:17.988
I'll have my office put out a statement.

49:17.988 --> 49:19.823
Work being performed on the dam.

49:21.491 --> 49:23.493
Sheriff Wilson's another story,

49:25.295 --> 49:27.631
but the coroner's exam is gonna take a couple of days,

49:27.664 --> 49:29.166
maybe enough time for us to come up

49:29.166 --> 49:31.368
with some sort of response.

49:33.103 --> 49:34.271
- There is no response.

49:35.205 --> 49:36.873
We got two people dead.

49:36.940 --> 49:39.943
Now the two options I see is that we cut off

49:39.977 --> 49:43.480
the shark's food supply or wait it out,

49:43.480 --> 49:45.949
and see if it starves itself to death.

49:45.949 --> 49:47.384
That's it.

49:47.384 --> 49:50.220
- And you are the authority on this?

49:50.220 --> 49:52.389
- I spoke to the experts.

49:52.456 --> 49:54.224
I drove down to the Ocean Institute.

49:59.463 --> 50:02.065
- This town can survive anything on two feet.

50:02.065 --> 50:04.634
Wild cats, sharks.

50:04.668 --> 50:06.169
There's only one person around here

50:06.169 --> 50:08.238
who's gonna take the fall for that sort of thing.

50:10.073 --> 50:11.641
Always nice to see you, Reema.

50:18.382 --> 50:22.219
(dramatic, suspenseful music)

50:29.593 --> 50:32.329
(motor whirring)

50:35.332 --> 50:38.335
(suspenseful music)

51:19.443 --> 51:22.212
(Spencer grunts)

51:23.980 --> 51:26.316
(liquid splashing)

51:26.383 --> 51:27.818
(tense music)

51:27.818 --> 51:30.487
- See if you're hungry now, you son of a bitch.

51:30.487 --> 51:33.156
(phone buzzing)

51:35.926 --> 51:36.760
Yeah?

51:39.463 --> 51:40.931
Yeah, no, I know.

51:40.964 --> 51:42.065
I just didn't look at the damn calendar is all.

51:43.800 --> 51:45.836
Yeah, no, that's fine.

51:45.902 --> 51:48.238
It's work. What do you want me to do?

51:50.607 --> 51:52.843
No, we're not done talking about the paper signing.

51:52.843 --> 51:55.912
(tense music)

51:55.946 --> 51:57.114
No, I gotta go.

52:01.485 --> 52:04.020
(gun blasting)

52:10.327 --> 52:12.829
(tense music)

52:19.836 --> 52:21.304
(engine revving)

52:21.304 --> 52:23.773
(water warbling)

52:23.773 --> 52:26.510
(motor whirring)

52:36.153 --> 52:38.855
(truck rumbling)

52:43.193 --> 52:44.027
Already?

52:44.961 --> 52:46.029
- Yes, already.

52:46.029 --> 52:47.564
You forget, didn't you?

52:47.631 --> 52:48.565
- No, I just thought it was gonna be

52:48.565 --> 52:50.066
later in the day, that's all.

52:50.133 --> 52:52.969
Hey, what I'd tell you about bringing the gun in the house?

52:53.003 --> 52:53.837
- I'm sorry, Dad.

52:53.837 --> 52:55.172
- It's all right.

52:55.205 --> 52:57.174
Apologies won't get you anywhere faster.

52:58.842 --> 52:59.643
- Yes, sir.

53:03.980 --> 53:05.182
- Hey, listen.

53:05.215 --> 53:06.716
I will be back to pick you up Sunday.

53:06.716 --> 53:09.186
You call me if you need anything, okay?

53:12.222 --> 53:14.090
Well, have a good weekend.

53:14.157 --> 53:14.991
- Yeah.

53:20.764 --> 53:23.533
(engine revving)

53:25.835 --> 53:27.204
- She's still mad, huh?

53:27.237 --> 53:28.071
- Yeah, you're screwed.

53:28.071 --> 53:29.239
- Yeah, I thought so.

53:32.342 --> 53:34.211
You keeping it clean like I showed you?

53:34.244 --> 53:35.078
- Yeah.

53:36.179 --> 53:37.581
- Good.

53:37.581 --> 53:39.849
Responsibility, it'll teach you

53:39.883 --> 53:41.384
how to do things for yourself.

53:44.221 --> 53:46.089
- There's no TV in the guest room.

53:47.924 --> 53:49.292
- Oh yeah, about that, yeah.

53:50.560 --> 53:51.394
Take my room.

53:52.562 --> 53:54.064
I gotta work this weekend anyway.

53:55.265 --> 53:56.233
Hey, don't pout.

53:57.434 --> 53:58.935
We'll call up Uncle Gary, come over here

53:58.969 --> 54:00.370
and keep you company until I get back.

54:00.403 --> 54:03.106
- I'm 13. I don't need a babysitter.

54:03.106 --> 54:04.941
Besides, he's not even a real uncle.

54:04.941 --> 54:06.943
He's just some guy from your AA meetings.

54:07.877 --> 54:08.712
Seriously?

54:10.113 --> 54:11.114
- I deserve that.

54:13.783 --> 54:15.585
But I need you to stay by the house.

54:19.055 --> 54:21.057
- Mom said you were working on the lake?

54:22.325 --> 54:23.727
- Yeah, it's nothing.

54:23.760 --> 54:25.629
We're just looking for something, but it reminds me.

54:25.629 --> 54:28.465
You stay out of the water this weekend, too.

54:28.465 --> 54:30.100
I don't want you down there with your buddies,

54:30.133 --> 54:31.835
flirting with girls, all right?

54:31.835 --> 54:33.503
Stay outta the water.

54:33.503 --> 54:34.671
Hey, I need to hear you say it.

54:34.671 --> 54:35.672
- I'll stay out of the lake.

54:35.739 --> 54:36.673
- [Spencer] Stay out of the lake.

54:36.673 --> 54:37.841
You promise? - Promise.

54:37.841 --> 54:39.309
- All right, you promised me.

54:45.615 --> 54:46.483
You hungry?

54:46.483 --> 54:47.317
- I can eat.

54:50.654 --> 54:52.088
- We might have to order out.

54:52.088 --> 54:53.523
But let's see. - That's fine.

54:53.523 --> 54:55.091
Your cooking sucks anyways.

54:55.125 --> 54:56.693
- [Spencer] Yeah, I know.

54:56.693 --> 54:59.429
(water splashing)

54:59.462 --> 55:02.365
(crickets chirping)

55:08.938 --> 55:11.641
(water warbling)

55:14.277 --> 55:15.679
(crickets chirping)

55:15.679 --> 55:18.214
(gentle music)

55:22.452 --> 55:25.822
(water splashing gently)

55:29.025 --> 55:32.028
(crickets chirping)

55:43.340 --> 55:46.242
(engine whirring)

55:58.888 --> 56:01.891
(muffled rock music)

56:23.713 --> 56:26.716
(upbeat rock music)

56:27.851 --> 56:31.054
(music stops abruptly)

56:34.891 --> 56:38.461
(gentle, melancholy music)

56:56.613 --> 56:58.114
- I love you, son.

57:02.752 --> 57:05.555
(gentle music)

57:05.555 --> 57:08.725
(light switch clicks)

57:19.269 --> 57:22.138
(door closes)

57:22.138 --> 57:24.641
(tense music)

57:29.646 --> 57:31.915
(can pops)

57:42.292 --> 57:44.828
(Spencer sighs)

57:44.828 --> 57:47.330
(tense music)

57:59.642 --> 58:01.544
(can pops)

58:01.544 --> 58:04.047
(tense music)

58:16.893 --> 58:19.729
(Spencer panting)

58:45.021 --> 58:47.257
(can pops)

58:48.758 --> 58:51.427
(Spencer pants)

58:54.163 --> 58:57.066
(Spencer stumbles)

59:01.738 --> 59:04.507
(water warbling)

59:06.876 --> 59:11.881
(engine whirring) (light adventure music)

59:23.459 --> 59:26.796
(tense adventure music)

1:00:10.940 --> 1:00:14.310
(tense adventure music)

1:00:20.750 --> 1:00:22.585
(music fading)

1:00:22.619 --> 1:00:24.621
All right, you son of a bitch.

1:00:24.654 --> 1:00:26.990
(liquid splashes)

1:00:26.990 --> 1:00:29.592
(Spencer gags)

1:00:37.867 --> 1:00:40.503
(Spencer sighs)

1:00:42.338 --> 1:00:47.310
(water splashing) (tense music)

1:00:52.815 --> 1:00:55.485
(water warbling)

1:00:57.453 --> 1:01:00.223
(water splashing)

1:01:04.193 --> 1:01:07.196
(gunshots blasting)

1:01:15.638 --> 1:01:20.643
(water warbling) (Spencer stumbles)

1:01:21.210 --> 1:01:23.546
(phone buzzes)

1:01:25.848 --> 1:01:26.683
What?

1:01:28.551 --> 1:01:30.653
Gary, I don't have time for it now, buddy.

1:01:31.754 --> 1:01:32.588
Kinda busy here.

1:01:34.190 --> 1:01:36.592
Have Grant duty, he's at the house.

1:01:36.592 --> 1:01:39.328
(water warbling)

1:01:40.596 --> 1:01:42.999
What do you mean he's not at the house?

1:01:43.032 --> 1:01:44.333
(tense music)

1:01:44.333 --> 1:01:47.503
The lake? I'm on the way.

1:01:47.503 --> 1:01:48.237
Fuck.

1:01:49.338 --> 1:01:52.208
(Spencer stumbles)

1:01:55.244 --> 1:01:58.214
(engine sputtering)

1:02:00.883 --> 1:02:03.286
(gunshots blasting)

1:02:03.286 --> 1:02:05.088
(water warbling)

1:02:05.088 --> 1:02:08.091
(gunshots blasting)

1:02:09.892 --> 1:02:12.895
(engine sputtering)

1:02:20.903 --> 1:02:22.238
Fucking perfect.

1:02:26.409 --> 1:02:28.778
(water splashing)

1:02:28.778 --> 1:02:31.280
(tense music)

1:02:32.915 --> 1:02:37.920
(water splashing) (tense music)

1:02:53.836 --> 1:02:56.906
(muffled rock music)

1:02:58.474 --> 1:03:01.010
(phone buzzing)

1:03:12.522 --> 1:03:15.458
(water splashing)

1:03:15.491 --> 1:03:18.995
(phone continues buzzing)

1:03:24.467 --> 1:03:25.968
Grant!

1:03:25.968 --> 1:03:27.136
Oh, fuck, boy.

1:03:28.504 --> 1:03:29.338
Grant!

1:03:34.277 --> 1:03:35.111
Grant!

1:03:36.012 --> 1:03:37.346
Goddamn it, son.

1:03:39.148 --> 1:03:39.982
Grant!

1:03:41.384 --> 1:03:42.718
Goddamn it, son.

1:03:44.520 --> 1:03:45.555
Shit.

1:03:45.555 --> 1:03:48.057
(tense music)

1:03:55.198 --> 1:03:57.133
(water splashing)

1:03:57.133 --> 1:03:58.301
Grant!

1:03:58.301 --> 1:03:59.569
Get outta the water!

1:03:59.569 --> 1:04:00.803
Grant!

1:04:00.837 --> 1:04:01.671
Grant!

1:04:01.704 --> 1:04:03.706
Get outta the water.

1:04:03.706 --> 1:04:06.142
- What? - Get outta the water.

1:04:07.510 --> 1:04:08.845
Oh my God. Shit.

1:04:10.079 --> 1:04:13.583
(tense, suspenseful music)

1:04:13.583 --> 1:04:16.018
(Grant gurgling)

1:04:16.052 --> 1:04:18.888
(water splashing)

1:04:23.726 --> 1:04:24.560
Grant.

1:04:26.762 --> 1:04:27.897
Get on my back, son.

1:04:27.897 --> 1:04:29.098
Listen to me.

1:04:29.165 --> 1:04:30.833
Listen to me, there's a shark in the lake.

1:04:30.867 --> 1:04:32.201
I need you to get on my back

1:04:32.201 --> 1:04:33.703
and hang on till we get to shore.

1:04:33.736 --> 1:04:36.439
Right. (grunts)

1:04:36.439 --> 1:04:38.074
(tense music)

1:04:38.074 --> 1:04:40.243
Don't look back, son.

1:04:40.243 --> 1:04:41.077
Ah!

1:04:45.781 --> 1:04:47.683
Come on, come on.

1:04:47.717 --> 1:04:48.718
It's okay.

1:04:48.751 --> 1:04:49.585
Come on.

1:04:49.585 --> 1:04:50.753
Gotta move, boy.

1:04:50.753 --> 1:04:53.723
(Grant yells) (water splashing)

1:04:53.756 --> 1:04:55.258
We're almost there. (Grant yells)

1:04:55.258 --> 1:04:56.092
We're almost there.

1:04:56.092 --> 1:04:57.093
We're almost there.

1:04:57.093 --> 1:04:58.294
Lay down, buddy.

1:04:58.294 --> 1:05:00.396
Yeah, you're all right.

1:05:00.429 --> 1:05:01.230
Hey, look at me.

1:05:01.230 --> 1:05:02.064
Stay with with me.

1:05:02.064 --> 1:05:05.234
Oh. (Grant yells)

1:05:05.268 --> 1:05:06.903
Hey, hey, listen to me.

1:05:06.903 --> 1:05:08.070
I gotta move you.

1:05:08.070 --> 1:05:09.305
I gotta get you patched up, all right?

1:05:09.305 --> 1:05:10.640
You gotta be brave for me, all right?

1:05:10.640 --> 1:05:11.707
Grab hold of my neck.

1:05:11.741 --> 1:05:12.775
Grab hold of my neck, you ready?

1:05:12.775 --> 1:05:16.312
One, two, three. (Grant screams)

1:05:16.379 --> 1:05:19.215
(water splashing)

1:05:46.275 --> 1:05:48.477
(door shuts)

1:05:48.477 --> 1:05:50.479
- What in the hell were you thinking?

1:05:52.748 --> 1:05:54.250
Spencer.

1:05:54.250 --> 1:05:55.584
- Stitches, all right?

1:05:55.618 --> 1:05:57.153
He's gonna be fine. - I'm not talking about that.

1:05:57.153 --> 1:05:58.354
The whole ride over here,

1:05:58.421 --> 1:06:00.423
he's telling me he was attacked by a shark.

1:06:00.456 --> 1:06:01.257
Is that true?

1:06:03.759 --> 1:06:05.928
Oh my God. And you didn't tell me?

1:06:07.129 --> 1:06:08.631
- Would it have done any good? No.

1:06:08.664 --> 1:06:10.166
- I wouldn't have brought him here if I knew that.

1:06:10.166 --> 1:06:11.701
You know he loves the water.

1:06:11.767 --> 1:06:14.136
- Hey, I told him, stay outta the lake, okay?

1:06:15.171 --> 1:06:16.105
He lied to me too.

1:06:16.105 --> 1:06:19.141
- Okay, I can stay here tonight.

1:06:19.175 --> 1:06:20.343
I'll drive him home in the morning.

1:06:20.343 --> 1:06:22.011
But Spencer, what the hell is going on?

1:06:24.714 --> 1:06:26.215
- There's a shark in the lake.

1:06:27.383 --> 1:06:30.486
Don't ask me how, but it survived.

1:06:30.519 --> 1:06:32.021
It's killed three people.

1:06:32.021 --> 1:06:33.990
- And this isn't on the news?

1:06:36.058 --> 1:06:38.394
And somehow you're in charge of this?

1:06:39.662 --> 1:06:42.131
- They need a fall guy. You're looking at him.

1:06:43.899 --> 1:06:45.701
- Spencer, I know you.

1:06:45.701 --> 1:06:48.537
Whatever this is, you cannot serve two masters.

1:06:50.039 --> 1:06:52.041
- I'm clean.

1:06:52.074 --> 1:06:55.378
On our son, I am clean.

1:06:55.378 --> 1:06:57.380
- What are you gonna do?

1:06:59.348 --> 1:07:01.984
- Mayor doesn't want me to bring attention to it,

1:07:01.984 --> 1:07:03.686
can't hire a guy to kill the shark.

1:07:05.388 --> 1:07:06.555
It's gotta be me.

1:07:06.555 --> 1:07:07.823
- Spencer, they're just looking for an out

1:07:07.857 --> 1:07:09.859
when this thing blows up in their faces.

1:07:09.892 --> 1:07:12.395
(tense music)

1:07:13.496 --> 1:07:14.430
What?

1:07:14.430 --> 1:07:16.265
- What'd you just say?

1:07:16.265 --> 1:07:18.734
I said, they're gonna blame you for this.

1:07:18.734 --> 1:07:19.769
- No, no, after that.

1:07:20.936 --> 1:07:22.405
It'll blow up in their faces.

1:07:24.740 --> 1:07:25.708
- I can help.

1:07:27.576 --> 1:07:29.111
(gun cocks)

1:07:29.178 --> 1:07:30.079
- Let's go.

1:07:32.048 --> 1:07:32.882
Nolan Holt.

1:07:34.784 --> 1:07:36.719
Get your ass out here.

1:07:36.752 --> 1:07:37.887
- Oh, hell.

1:07:39.588 --> 1:07:43.092
What'd you come all the way over here to arrest my ass?

1:07:43.092 --> 1:07:44.760
- No, I came to help you.

1:07:44.794 --> 1:07:46.262
- Help me?

1:07:46.262 --> 1:07:47.096
- Yeah.

1:07:49.298 --> 1:07:50.099
- Who's she?

1:07:52.401 --> 1:07:53.936
- [Spencer] It's my wife.

1:07:53.936 --> 1:07:57.039
- Ex-wife. - Nothing's been signed yet.

1:07:58.908 --> 1:08:00.576
- So you two need to get on the same page.

1:08:00.576 --> 1:08:01.544
- Nevermind all that, Nolan.

1:08:01.544 --> 1:08:02.978
It's not why I'm here.

1:08:02.978 --> 1:08:04.814
I'm here because I need you as much as you need me.

1:08:04.880 --> 1:08:05.948
All right?

1:08:05.948 --> 1:08:06.782
- Oh yeah?

1:08:07.917 --> 1:08:09.151
What do you want from me?

1:08:09.151 --> 1:08:11.587
- You wanna make this shark thing disappear?

1:08:11.620 --> 1:08:14.056
Save your sorry ass in the process?

1:08:14.056 --> 1:08:15.591
I need you to do something for me.

1:08:17.626 --> 1:08:19.228
- All right, what do you want?

1:08:19.228 --> 1:08:21.063
- Do you have anything that explodes?

1:08:22.298 --> 1:08:25.134
Now think, dynamite, gunpowder, anything.

1:08:25.134 --> 1:08:26.936
- C-4.

1:08:26.969 --> 1:08:27.803
- What?

1:08:29.004 --> 1:08:30.272
- What?

1:08:30.306 --> 1:08:31.140
- C-4.

1:08:32.308 --> 1:08:33.476
You want something that explodes, right?

1:08:33.476 --> 1:08:35.945
Well, that's the ticket right there.

1:08:35.978 --> 1:08:37.146
What you want it for?

1:08:37.146 --> 1:08:38.347
- Where in the hell did you get C-4?

1:08:38.414 --> 1:08:40.483
- What, we gonna ask 20 questions here?

1:08:40.483 --> 1:08:41.984
Or do you want the damn stuff?

1:08:44.019 --> 1:08:45.321
- What do you want for it?

1:08:49.592 --> 1:08:51.127
- Get the sheriff off my ass.

1:08:53.863 --> 1:08:54.697
- Deal.

1:08:59.368 --> 1:09:00.169
Thanks, Nolan.

1:09:06.008 --> 1:09:08.878
- Be sure you poke it with a stick.

1:09:10.779 --> 1:09:12.681
(Nolan imitates explosion)

1:09:12.681 --> 1:09:15.351
Right, Macho Man? (chuckles)

1:09:17.153 --> 1:09:19.655
(tense music)

1:09:37.239 --> 1:09:39.008
- Here, take over up front.

1:09:39.041 --> 1:09:41.577
Anything breaks the surface, you shoot it.

1:09:41.577 --> 1:09:44.079
(tense music)

1:09:59.428 --> 1:10:01.931
If he's in the shallow waters,

1:10:03.098 --> 1:10:05.401
all I gotta get him to do now is swallow this.

1:10:06.435 --> 1:10:08.671
- Okay, then what?

1:10:08.704 --> 1:10:11.207
- Then we blow it to pieces with this.

1:10:18.614 --> 1:10:20.115
(liquid splashes)

1:10:20.182 --> 1:10:23.285
(Spencer gags)

1:10:23.285 --> 1:10:24.220
- All right.

1:10:24.253 --> 1:10:25.221
- That should get his attention.

1:10:25.221 --> 1:10:26.055
- Now what?

1:10:26.956 --> 1:10:27.790
- Now?

1:10:29.024 --> 1:10:30.192
Now we wait.

1:10:30.192 --> 1:10:33.195
(suspenseful music)

1:10:35.130 --> 1:10:37.066
(birds chirping)

1:10:37.099 --> 1:10:39.935
(water splashing)

1:10:45.140 --> 1:10:45.941
I don't get it.

1:10:47.443 --> 1:10:49.078
Damn thing should've been here by now.

1:10:50.946 --> 1:10:52.214
I'm almost out of bait.

1:10:52.214 --> 1:10:54.283
- Maybe we should move to a different spot.

1:10:55.884 --> 1:11:00.756
- Deeper waters won't work, in case one of us has to get in.

1:11:01.390 --> 1:11:02.658
- Get in?

1:11:02.658 --> 1:11:05.661
As in get in the water with the shark?

1:11:05.728 --> 1:11:07.229
- How else do you expect it to swallow the C-4?

1:11:07.263 --> 1:11:08.764
- I don't know.

1:11:08.764 --> 1:11:10.065
I thought it would come close enough we could just toss it

1:11:10.065 --> 1:11:11.300
in its mouth.

1:11:11.300 --> 1:11:13.469
- Really? Yeah, that'd be easier, for sure.

1:11:17.139 --> 1:11:20.109
- You're not seriously considering this, are you?

1:11:20.109 --> 1:11:21.577
- Oh, what? What's this?

1:11:21.577 --> 1:11:23.078
Huh?

1:11:23.078 --> 1:11:24.513
All of a sudden, you give a shit about what happens to me?

1:11:24.513 --> 1:11:26.348
I needed this person before, not now.

1:11:27.182 --> 1:11:28.017
- So did I.

1:11:29.852 --> 1:11:31.153
(Spencer stumbles)

1:11:31.153 --> 1:11:32.488
- Fuck.

1:11:32.521 --> 1:11:34.189
This ain't working.

1:11:34.256 --> 1:11:35.457
I'm getting in.

1:11:37.826 --> 1:11:42.331
(Dottie breathing shaking) (metallic rattling)

1:11:42.364 --> 1:11:44.133
- Just make it a clean shot. - No!

1:11:45.367 --> 1:11:48.437
(water splashes)

1:11:48.470 --> 1:11:50.806
(tense music)

1:11:50.839 --> 1:11:55.110
(suspenseful adventure music)

1:11:55.110 --> 1:11:57.212
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

1:11:57.212 --> 1:11:59.682
(tense music)

1:12:00.716 --> 1:12:01.984
- Come on.

1:12:02.017 --> 1:12:04.019
Oh, come on, oh come on.

1:12:04.019 --> 1:12:06.522
(tense music)

1:12:07.856 --> 1:12:10.526
(Dottie grunts)

1:12:12.194 --> 1:12:14.963
(water bubbling)

1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:19.201
Shoot it!

1:12:19.201 --> 1:12:22.037
(gunshot blasting) (C-4 exploding)

1:12:22.037 --> 1:12:24.740
(Dottie panting)

1:12:29.545 --> 1:12:32.247
(birds chirping)

1:12:35.818 --> 1:12:38.487
(both grunting)

1:12:40.389 --> 1:12:45.394
- Come here. (Dottie panting)

1:12:46.228 --> 1:12:49.264
We did it. (Dottie gasping)

1:12:49.331 --> 1:12:51.867
(both panting)

1:12:53.869 --> 1:12:56.205
(birds chirping)

1:12:56.238 --> 1:12:58.941
(phones ringing)

1:13:05.080 --> 1:13:06.749
- I'm glad you're starting over.

1:13:06.749 --> 1:13:08.350
All of you.

1:13:08.384 --> 1:13:10.586
Gonna miss you around here, Warden.

1:13:10.586 --> 1:13:12.354
- Nah, the new guy'll do just fine.

1:13:13.756 --> 1:13:16.258
Besides, quitting while you're still good at something

1:13:16.258 --> 1:13:17.593
ain't the same as quitting.

1:13:19.094 --> 1:13:21.430
- I can't seem to find that thermos of yours anywhere.

1:13:22.297 --> 1:13:23.198
- No, it's gone.

1:13:24.366 --> 1:13:25.534
I don't need it anymore.

1:13:27.102 --> 1:13:29.471
- Well, if you ever wanna stop and pay a visit,

1:13:29.471 --> 1:13:32.775
there will always be a pot of coffee on for you.

1:13:32.775 --> 1:13:33.609
- I believe it.

1:13:36.145 --> 1:13:37.479
Thanks, Reema.

1:13:37.479 --> 1:13:40.215
(phones ringing)

1:13:49.792 --> 1:13:52.394
(box rustling)

1:13:53.796 --> 1:13:58.500
(water splashing) (birds chirping)

1:13:58.567 --> 1:14:00.903
(seagulls cawing)

1:14:00.936 --> 1:14:03.405
(tense music)

1:14:05.407 --> 1:14:08.110
(dramatic music)

1:14:09.244 --> 1:14:12.815
(tense, suspenseful music)

1:14:33.502 --> 1:14:35.804
- Yeah, I'm working on my book right now, Bubba.

1:14:37.139 --> 1:14:39.942
Well, it ain't finished yet.

1:14:39.942 --> 1:14:41.810
I mean, I'm working on it as we speak.

1:14:43.045 --> 1:14:46.148
Yeah, it'll be out soon. (chuckles)

1:14:46.181 --> 1:14:47.349
First I'm gonna go out on the lake,

1:14:47.349 --> 1:14:49.051
I'm gonna get me some dinner.

1:14:49.051 --> 1:14:50.886
Get me some of that poontang fish fin,

1:14:50.886 --> 1:14:52.888
you know what I mean?

1:14:52.955 --> 1:14:56.625
Shark fin, if I can. (chuckles)

1:14:56.658 --> 1:14:58.193
All right, I'll call you back.

1:14:58.193 --> 1:14:59.361
All right, all right, all right.

1:14:59.394 --> 1:15:02.731
(leaves crunching)

1:15:02.798 --> 1:15:03.632
Whoo!

1:15:05.167 --> 1:15:08.003
(water splashing)

1:15:08.871 --> 1:15:10.405
Goddamn, it's cold.

1:15:11.874 --> 1:15:12.708
Whoo!

1:15:14.910 --> 1:15:15.744
Whoo-whee.

1:15:17.713 --> 1:15:18.547
Yeah.

1:15:24.686 --> 1:15:26.855
I'll get you tonight, boy.

1:15:30.359 --> 1:15:34.530
Oh, yeah. (hums)

1:15:42.538 --> 1:15:43.372
All right.

1:15:51.580 --> 1:15:55.083
(line thwacking) Oh yeah!

1:15:55.083 --> 1:15:58.086
(Nolan grunts)

1:15:58.086 --> 1:16:03.025
There we go. (water splashing)

1:16:12.200 --> 1:16:13.035
Chapter 1.

1:16:15.070 --> 1:16:16.905
"Terror in the Water."

1:16:18.874 --> 1:16:21.777
Today's October 3rd, 2021.

1:16:24.780 --> 1:16:27.583
It's been three weeks since this sleepy town

1:16:27.583 --> 1:16:29.084
been ravaged by...

1:16:31.620 --> 1:16:32.454
The lake shark.

1:16:37.292 --> 1:16:38.894
Ah.

1:16:38.894 --> 1:16:43.165
It's been three weeks since this town...

1:16:45.767 --> 1:16:48.604
Been ravaged the silent predator known

1:16:48.604 --> 1:16:50.772
as the lake monster.

1:16:52.441 --> 1:16:55.277
(water splashing)

1:16:59.281 --> 1:17:02.818
It's been three weeks since this sleepy town

1:17:04.453 --> 1:17:07.856
been ravaged the Lone Star Shark.

1:17:10.492 --> 1:17:14.262
Yeah! Got a best-seller, you know it, boy.

1:17:14.262 --> 1:17:15.631
Whoo! Good stuff.

1:17:16.832 --> 1:17:18.333
Oh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

1:17:19.201 --> 1:17:20.035
Oh boy.

1:17:21.003 --> 1:17:23.205
Goddamn it, son of a bitch!

1:17:25.674 --> 1:17:28.777
Dumb piece of shit. (grunts)

1:17:28.777 --> 1:17:30.946
Am I stuck on something? What is that?

1:17:30.946 --> 1:17:34.716
Goddamn it. (water splashing)

1:17:34.716 --> 1:17:39.721
Where's it at? (tense music)

1:17:40.822 --> 1:17:45.727
Oh, shit! (water splashing)

1:17:47.329 --> 1:17:49.698
This is Nolan Holt, confirming the worst fears:

1:17:50.799 --> 1:17:52.300
the Lone Star Shark lives on.

1:17:53.735 --> 1:17:55.303
Stay tuned.

1:17:55.337 --> 1:17:58.173
(water splashing)

1:18:03.245 --> 1:18:06.682
(Nolan breathes shakily)

1:18:11.987 --> 1:18:15.157
(Nolan screams)

1:18:15.157 --> 1:18:18.694
(tense, suspenseful music)

1:19:20.055 --> 1:19:23.892
(dramatic, suspenseful music)

1:19:53.955 --> 1:19:56.691
(dramatic music)
