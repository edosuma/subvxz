the procedure,

It explains
all your symptoms,

38:41.787 --> 38:43.455
and it's exacerbated
by stress,

38:43.589 --> 38:45.223
which is likely
what caused
your heart attack.

38:46.725 --> 38:50.261
You need to stop
seeking out
other people's pain.

38:50.396 --> 38:51.763
It's literally
killing you.

38:55.634 --> 38:57.168
You're the Chief
of Surgery.

38:57.302 --> 38:59.371
You could have sent
somebody else
to tell me this.

39:00.606 --> 39:01.673
Sure.

39:01.807 --> 39:03.442
But then I'd miss
my chance to gloat.

39:04.843 --> 39:06.545
You're here
because you're hurting

39:07.813 --> 39:09.214
and you don't know
where else to go.

39:12.484 --> 39:13.852
Go ahead.
Use your magic.

39:15.286 --> 39:16.822
Tell me
what's wrong with me.

39:18.924 --> 39:21.292
How do I stop
feeling like this?

39:22.761 --> 39:24.596
It doesn't work
that way.

39:24.730 --> 39:26.164
I don't have
a magic wand.

39:28.266 --> 39:29.801
I can only hold up
a mirror,

39:31.470 --> 39:32.504
make you slow down,

39:33.705 --> 39:34.873
look at the parts
of yourself

39:35.006 --> 39:37.709
that you've been
trying to ignore

39:37.843 --> 39:40.378
because you're afraid
if you look too closely,
you'll break.

39:45.350 --> 39:46.818
Maybe you will.
I don't know.

39:47.753 --> 39:49.621
Maybe breaking
is the point.

39:54.926 --> 39:56.795
You can't outrun
your pain, Dr. Lim.

39:56.928 --> 39:59.197
If you keep trying,
it's gonna kill you.

39:59.330 --> 40:03.268
** Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh,
oh, oh-oh-oh

40:05.336 --> 40:07.839
** Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh,
oh, oh-oh-oh

40:08.740 --> 40:11.242
** Where do my hands go?

40:11.376 --> 40:13.211
** Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh,
oh, oh-oh-oh

40:13.344 --> 40:14.513
(TIRES SQUEALING)

40:14.646 --> 40:21.219
** Have time to play
with my mind

40:23.622 --> 40:25.891
** Where does my tongue go? **
