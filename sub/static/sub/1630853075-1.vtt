WEBVTT

00:22.248 --> 00:24.857
So this is, like, where
the South County bus stops.

00:24.859 --> 00:26.841
Yeah, one time I saw
this kid get off

00:26.843 --> 00:28.085
with a ferret on a leash.

00:28.087 --> 00:29.695
Yeah, and the guy who drives
the bus, Mr. Fargas,

00:29.697 --> 00:31.363
he used to be my soccer coach,

00:31.365 --> 00:34.091
and he said that I wasn't
gonna amount to anything,

00:34.093 --> 00:36.593
that I was ill-behaved,
and that I ran weird.

00:36.595 --> 00:39.263
Yeah, but then soccer and art
got canceled at our school,

00:39.265 --> 00:41.064
and now Fargas
is driving a bus,

00:41.066 --> 00:42.875
so, you know,
who's the loser now, Farg?

00:42.877 --> 00:44.451
Here it comes!

00:44.453 --> 00:45.544
Go, go, go, go!

00:50.033 --> 00:51.550
Be cool, be cool, be cool,
be cool.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.555
(laughter)

00:56.557 --> 00:58.057
Ah, yes!

00:58.059 --> 00:59.966
-Yes! Oh, my God!
-KELLY: He's gonna get us!

00:59.968 --> 01:02.969
SHRUB: Run!
Take that, Fargas!

01:02.971 --> 01:04.379
Oh, my God!

01:04.381 --> 01:06.123
<i> KELLY: So Shrub's</i>
<i> actually not just my cousin.</i>

01:06.125 --> 01:07.791
-He's also my best friend.
-Yeah.

01:07.793 --> 01:09.126
Tell 'em why.

01:09.128 --> 01:10.885
Uh, he's the only person
I can share

01:10.887 --> 01:13.130
-a bucket of Munchkins with.
-Bingo.

01:13.132 --> 01:14.907
-Don't take a chocolate.
-SHRUB: I'm not.

01:14.909 --> 01:16.483
<i> KELLY:</i>
<i> So I like the chocolate ones.</i>

01:16.485 --> 01:19.727
<i> I love the butternut ones,</i>
<i> but I hate the cinnamon ones,</i>

01:19.729 --> 01:20.895
<i> and Shrub inhales those.</i>

01:20.897 --> 01:22.397
And, like, it's, like,
not, 'cause I love

01:22.399 --> 01:25.417
the cinnamon ones so much.
I just feel sorry for 'em.

01:25.419 --> 01:26.251
Yeah.

01:26.253 --> 01:27.461
'Cause they're always left.

01:29.998 --> 01:31.548
I like the underdog.

01:37.172 --> 01:38.580
<i> FATHER JOE: Well,</i>
<i> the church moved me here</i>

01:38.582 --> 01:41.416
about eight months ago
from Minneapolis, yeah.

01:41.418 --> 01:45.162
Bit of a change, you know.
Big responsibility.

01:45.164 --> 01:47.347
But I've really grown fond
of the people here.

01:47.349 --> 01:49.274
<i> -Shrub and Kelly, um...</i>
-(laughs)

01:49.276 --> 01:51.335
<i> FATHER JOE: Look, it's</i>
<i> not easy</i>

01:51.337 --> 01:53.094
<i> being a young adult</i>
<i> these days.</i>

01:53.096 --> 01:54.004
<i> These kids,</i>
<i> they need guidance.</i>

01:54.006 --> 01:55.505
This is my bike!

01:55.507 --> 01:59.267
I'm normally "Reverend,"
but they call me Father Joe.

01:59.269 --> 02:02.696
Sometimes I feel
like their dad...

02:02.698 --> 02:06.107
proud, concerned.

02:06.109 --> 02:07.942
Father Joe,
why don't you, uh, [bleep]?

02:07.944 --> 02:10.462
(laughs)
[bleep].

02:10.464 --> 02:13.632
But anyway, they're--they're
making great progress.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.950
And they've gotten a lot better
in their cursing too.

02:15.952 --> 02:18.786
I think this week
we had two [bleep]s.

02:18.788 --> 02:20.622
I'm sorry.

02:20.624 --> 02:24.034
Are you the crew that's
filming that movie about us?

02:24.036 --> 02:25.702
Ah, man, come on,
all right, okay.

02:25.704 --> 02:26.961
So where--where you staying?

02:26.963 --> 02:28.388
Don't tell me it's Norma's B&B

02:28.390 --> 02:30.149
because I'ma tell you
right now,

02:30.151 --> 02:32.559
the Bs stand for "bedbugs,"

02:32.561 --> 02:36.638
and the Norma stands
for "not normal at all."

02:36.640 --> 02:37.805
<i> I don't want you getting</i>

02:37.807 --> 02:39.158
<i> the wrong impression</i>
<i> of Flatch.</i>

02:39.160 --> 02:40.975
<i> We are an upstanding town,</i>

02:40.977 --> 02:43.162
<i> and we deserve</i>
<i> some damn attention.</i>

02:43.164 --> 02:46.406
<i> We got two restaurants,</i>
<i> one with menus,</i>

02:46.408 --> 02:49.226
and last year,
someone gave birth to twins.

02:49.228 --> 02:52.913
So now we got young people
all over the place.

02:52.915 --> 02:55.340
The young people
are our future.

02:55.342 --> 02:56.082
You know?

02:56.084 --> 02:58.826
KELLY: Hey, Mandy.

02:58.828 --> 03:00.012
MANDY: Not them though.

03:00.014 --> 03:02.014
Walking disappointments.

03:02.016 --> 03:04.457
Yes, Flatch does have
some colorful characters,

03:04.459 --> 03:06.259
but, you know,
it's part of its charm.

03:06.261 --> 03:10.004
(screaming)
I'll miss you, Father!

03:10.006 --> 03:12.507
You guys, we're--
we're filming, here.

03:12.509 --> 03:13.525
(retching)

03:20.534 --> 03:23.017
<i> SHRUB: The Scarecrow Festival</i>
<i> is pretty much, like,</i>

03:23.019 --> 03:24.928
<i> the biggest</i>
<i> and best day of the year.</i>

03:24.930 --> 03:26.038
<i> KELLY: People make scarecrows,</i>

03:26.040 --> 03:27.431
<i> they put them up</i>
<i> all over town,</i>

03:27.433 --> 03:29.208
<i> and everyone votes</i>
<i> for which one's best.</i>

03:29.210 --> 03:30.617
And you are looking
at the winner.

03:30.769 --> 03:33.103
Like, I have a killer design
and a prime location this year

03:33.105 --> 03:34.529
right on the green.

03:34.548 --> 03:36.882
Like, that guy with that spot
last year won the whole thing,

03:36.884 --> 03:38.124
and his was pretty much, like,

03:38.126 --> 03:40.794
some frickin'
used clothes and twine.

03:40.796 --> 03:42.203
Winner gets
a hot air balloon ride.

03:42.205 --> 03:43.296
Yeah, and you're
on the front page

03:43.298 --> 03:45.449
-of the "Flatch Patriot."
-It's so dumb.

03:45.451 --> 03:48.227
Oh, and you throwing
a frying pan in the air isn't?

03:48.229 --> 03:50.896
"A," the skillet toss
takes real skill.

03:50.898 --> 03:53.957
B, there's a trophy.

03:53.959 --> 03:55.792
Fine, I will take
my nan on the balloon.

03:55.794 --> 03:57.236
I don't care.

03:57.238 --> 03:59.463
She doesn't even like heights,
and you know that.

03:59.465 --> 04:00.981
I'm about to be
in the mile high club

04:00.983 --> 04:02.816
with my grandma
while you're on the ground,

04:02.818 --> 04:04.225
crying like a little baby.

04:04.227 --> 04:06.245
I haven't cried since
last year, and you know that!

04:07.081 --> 04:08.247
<i> KELLY: Well, a skillet toss</i>
<i> is where you take</i>

04:08.249 --> 04:11.324
a 5-pound pan,
bigger than this one, okay,

04:11.326 --> 04:13.961
and you chuck it
as far as you possibly can.

04:15.330 --> 04:18.906
I think it came from,
like, when the pioneer ladies

04:18.908 --> 04:20.575
would throw things
at their kids.

04:20.577 --> 04:23.095
Wait, or the Indians?
I don't kn--look it up.

04:23.097 --> 04:24.838
You can look it up.

04:24.840 --> 04:26.990
<i> My dad won it</i>
<i> seven years in a row</i>

04:26.992 --> 04:28.008
<i> till he blew his knee out.</i>

04:28.010 --> 04:29.493
<i> Really opened up the field.</i>

04:29.495 --> 04:31.252
My dad and I are super close,
so...

04:31.254 --> 04:33.087
<i> time to get the gold skillet</i>

04:33.089 --> 04:35.607
<i> back to the Mallet family</i>
<i> where it belongs.</i>

04:35.609 --> 04:37.425
Okay, so, like, most people,

04:37.427 --> 04:39.594
they just, like,
free-form the whole body.

04:39.596 --> 04:41.929
That's, like--that's amateur
if you ask me.

04:41.931 --> 04:44.265
Like, I actually make sure
that my scarecrow

04:44.267 --> 04:48.695
has the correct ratio
of arm length to head span.

04:48.697 --> 04:51.957
Also, real shoes.

04:51.959 --> 04:54.293
This is what we call
a crowd-pleaser.

04:54.295 --> 04:57.370
See, I don't like crowds.
I'm not safe in them.

04:57.372 --> 05:00.874
I have a lot of enemies
just like my dad, right?

05:00.876 --> 05:02.801
That's why I have my gang
to protect me.

05:02.803 --> 05:05.195
<i> SHRUB: Kelly has this group</i>
<i> of seventh-grade kids</i>

05:06.790 --> 05:08.623
<i> freakishly big one from fifth.</i>

05:08.625 --> 05:10.958
Okay, all I want is it to look
like it's chairs in a circle

05:10.960 --> 05:11.885
and everything else
cleared out.

05:11.887 --> 05:13.386
Does that make sense?

05:13.388 --> 05:16.206
And let's just get better at
knowing my needs a little bit.

05:17.133 --> 05:18.966
<i> KELLY: So his real name's</i>
<i> actually Lloyd.</i>

05:18.968 --> 05:20.560
Yeah, after my dad.

05:20.562 --> 05:22.228
Yeah, his dad drank
a lot of Busch beer,

05:22.230 --> 05:23.713
so they started
calling him Busch.

05:23.715 --> 05:25.732
Yeah, and so they
started calling me Shrub,

05:25.734 --> 05:28.476
for, like, a little bush.

05:28.478 --> 05:31.830
But, like, he left
when I was a baby, so...

05:31.832 --> 05:33.665
Yeah, but I bet
he still drinks beer.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.650
Yeah.

05:35.652 --> 05:37.836
Hey!
Screw you too!

-Just walked right into me.

07:22.609 --> 07:24.851
Mm-hmm.

07:24.853 --> 07:27.020
Yeah, then he dumped me.

07:27.022 --> 07:31.265
He said he needed space
to focus on the church,

09:21.395 --> 09:23.469
Uh, she makes her own soap,
but she doesn't bathe,

09:23.471 --> 09:26.064
-so that's what I call irony.
-Yeah.

09:26.066 --> 09:29.142
Oh, this is Len.
He's a weird, mean, old man.

09:29.144 --> 09:31.461
-Oh, yeah?
-Oh, see?

09:31.463 --> 09:35.156
Hey, hey, Beth's back
from "cosmetology" school.

09:36.726 --> 09:39.160
Looks like they didn't teach
her how to fix her own hair.

09:39.805 --> 09:40.895
She's beautiful.

09:40.897 --> 09:42.563
He has a massive crush
on Beth.

09:42.565 --> 09:43.731
Dude!

09:43.733 --> 09:45.475
She has the personality
of a diaper wipe.

09:45.477 --> 09:47.234
First semester
of cosmetology school

09:47.236 --> 09:49.329
you learn
sanitation procedures.

09:49.331 --> 09:52.239
Next semester we get
to touch real human hair,

09:52.241 --> 09:55.093
but touching real people
with real human hair

09:55.095 --> 09:57.262
isn't until year two.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.264
Problem is there are,
like, no people

09:59.266 --> 10:00.932
in this town
to get crushes on.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.326
Uh, Beth is objectively foxy.

10:03.328 --> 10:07.088
Um, also I did Match,
and it put me with her,

10:07.090 --> 10:09.256
and the next-closest girl
was in Indiana.

10:09.258 --> 10:11.092
-That's way too far.
-Way too far.

10:11.094 --> 10:13.002
She's about
to be wicked impressed

10:13.004 --> 10:14.838
with my big win.

10:14.840 --> 10:16.506
Yeah, this is just lazy.

10:16.508 --> 10:18.174
I mean, if you can't be
bothered to make real hands,

10:18.176 --> 10:19.433
you don't deserve to be here.

10:19.435 --> 10:20.360
Simple as that.

10:20.362 --> 10:21.786
Technically not even
a scarecrow

10:21.788 --> 10:23.179
because there's no hay in it.

10:23.181 --> 10:25.682
It's just a rag on a stick.

10:25.684 --> 10:27.125
Embarrassing.

10:28.019 --> 10:29.276
I mean, I get it,

10:29.278 --> 10:31.278
but it's not
making me feel anything.

10:31.280 --> 10:35.675
Hey, hey!
Scrub, hey!

10:36.970 --> 10:38.452
Mickey and me were born
on the same day

10:38.454 --> 10:40.864
at the same hospital,
so ever since we were babies,

10:40.866 --> 10:42.699
he thinks we're best friends.

10:42.701 --> 10:44.200
Calls me his bro.

10:44.202 --> 10:45.292
MICKEY:
No donation is too big...

10:45.294 --> 10:47.128
(coins rattle)
Or too small!

10:47.130 --> 10:49.296
Dude, the Fourth of July
is, like, eight months away.

10:49.298 --> 10:51.724
Yeah, and I don't have
any cash on me.

10:51.726 --> 10:53.467
Yeah, also I hate fireworks.

10:53.469 --> 10:55.136
Everyone loves
the Flatch fireworks, my bro.

10:55.138 --> 10:56.396
Oh, okay.

10:56.548 --> 10:57.881
And if you don't have cash,
you can always donate

10:57.883 --> 10:59.157
in cryptocurrency.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.993
Yeah, Mickey, we'll totally
pay you in made-up money.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.328
(whispering)
So sad.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.497
I've been trading Bitcoin
for, like, a year now.

11:05.499 --> 11:06.831
Made $1,000.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.502
Ooh, minus the money I spent
on the bunting for my stall.

11:10.504 --> 11:13.546
Oh, and the 50 I set aside
for Shrub's birthday present.

11:15.083 --> 11:16.824
(whispers)
It's an iguana.

11:16.826 --> 11:18.510
Don't tell my bro.

11:18.512 --> 11:19.919
Do you wanna come over later
and "Fortnite"?

11:19.921 --> 11:20.995
Yeah, no.

11:20.997 --> 11:22.238
<i> We are not friends.</i>

11:22.240 --> 11:23.907
<i> He's just the only person</i>
<i> in town</i>

11:23.909 --> 11:24.908
<i> with a working PlayStation.</i>

11:24.910 --> 11:26.000
-Yes!
-Oh, yeah!

11:26.002 --> 11:28.594
-Oh!
-God.

11:28.596 --> 11:30.563
How are you doing it?

11:32.417 --> 11:34.025
ROBOT SCARECROW:
Beep, beep, boop, bop, bop.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.509
Oh, that's hilarious!

11:35.511 --> 11:38.238
Yeah, that's not a scarecrow.
That is a talking box.

11:38.240 --> 11:41.441
ROBOT SCARECROW:
Candy apples do not compute!

11:41.443 --> 11:42.775
Do not compute.

11:42.777 --> 11:44.277
Who is that?
Who is that?

11:44.279 --> 11:46.037
ROBOT SCARECROW:
Beep, beep, bop, bop.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.780
Why does the scarecrow
have a robot voice?

11:47.782 --> 11:50.575
ROBOT SCARECROW:
Because I am a robot.

11:50.577 --> 11:52.711
(laughter)

11:56.032 --> 11:58.441
Kelly, hey.

11:58.443 --> 12:00.293
Have you considered joining
the Historical Society?

12:00.295 --> 12:02.962
Because, you know,
for just $25,

12:02.964 --> 12:05.131
you can preserve
Flatch's great past

12:05.133 --> 12:06.783
and secure its future.

12:06.785 --> 12:08.284
Mm, no, Nadine.

12:08.286 --> 12:10.228
I have not considered
joining the society

12:10.230 --> 12:13.231
-because I'm not 75 years old.
-NADINE: And you don't look it.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.400
Ooh, ooh, be really careful,
really old.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.977
Believe it or not,
in second grade,

12:17.979 --> 12:19.979
Kelly and I
were, like, best friends,

12:19.981 --> 12:22.556
but I guess I kept achieving

12:22.558 --> 12:26.152
and she just never did
achieve anything at all.

12:26.154 --> 12:28.562
<i> I consider</i>
<i> Colonel Robert Flatch</i>

12:28.564 --> 12:30.081
<i> to be my personal mentor</i>
<i> 'cause, you know,</i>

12:30.083 --> 12:32.992
<i> he was just 25 when he founded</i>
<i> this town in 1810.</i>

12:32.994 --> 12:35.161
<i> 25 years old.</i>
<i> It's such a funny story.</i>

12:35.163 --> 12:37.163
<i> Colonel Flatch gets lost</i>
<i> one night with his regiment,</i>

12:37.165 --> 12:40.316
and he ends up right here,
it turns out,

12:40.318 --> 12:42.093
where they built this latrine.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.003
That one, right there.

12:44.005 --> 12:45.930
<i> Just to think,</i>
<i> one whole town</i>

12:45.932 --> 12:47.932
<i> started with one little hole.</i>

12:47.934 --> 12:50.159
<i> It gives me chills</i>
<i> to think about it.</i>

12:50.161 --> 12:51.327
Anyway, it's my job
to protect it

12:51.329 --> 12:53.271
because, at town events,
unfortunately,

12:53.273 --> 12:55.348
people like to use it
as a Porta Potti.

12:55.350 --> 12:58.276
Almost there.
Time for the unveiling.

12:58.278 --> 13:02.688
It's a prime spot,
and I am ready.

13:02.690 --> 13:05.508
Uh, this is my spot.

13:05.510 --> 13:10.163
I'm sorry, Shrub,
but I was given this area.

13:12.017 --> 13:15.109
No, I signed up for that spot
with Mrs. Wicks months ago.

13:15.111 --> 13:17.020
I'm sorry, Shrub.
That's not what the map says.

13:17.022 --> 13:19.280
No, God,
Beth has to see me win.

13:19.282 --> 13:20.281
And that's not even
a scarecrow.

13:20.283 --> 13:21.299
That is a teddy bear in a hat.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.525
(crow caws)

13:22.527 --> 13:25.619
Oh, my God!
Even the crows can see that!

13:25.621 --> 13:27.697
Well, it says here
that you're at Piswall Farm.

13:28.383 --> 13:31.184
There is no way in hell
I'm going there.

13:34.630 --> 13:36.064
Unbelievable.

13:42.047 --> 13:45.715
You know how they, like,
release a McRib in February,

13:45.717 --> 13:47.141
and you get all excited,

13:47.143 --> 13:49.994
and then they just take it away
like it never happened?

13:49.996 --> 13:52.831
Like, that's how I feel
right now...

13:52.833 --> 13:54.223
betrayed.

13:54.225 --> 13:56.059
Did you tell people
to come vote for me?

13:56.061 --> 13:58.244
Can you help me look
for my sneaker, please?

13:58.246 --> 13:59.912
Your shoe does not weigh
as much as a skillet.

13:59.914 --> 14:01.247
There's, like, no comparison.

14:01.249 --> 14:02.674
Okay, I told
everyone to come,

14:02.676 --> 14:04.175
but everyone's really into
the robot scarecrow.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.568
Oh, my God,
there's no such thing

14:05.570 --> 14:08.404
as a robot scarecrow!
There are no crows in space!

14:08.406 --> 14:09.255
Oh, check it out.

14:09.498 --> 14:11.090
I got a video of it twerking.
It's insane.

14:11.092 --> 14:12.499
-(laughing)
-(remixed banjo music playing)

14:12.501 --> 14:15.502
(sarcastically) Whoa, wow.
That's really awesome!

14:15.504 --> 14:16.262
Are you kidding me?

14:16.264 --> 14:18.022
<i> Father Joe's been working</i>

14:18.024 --> 14:19.432
<i> with Shrub</i>
<i> on his anger issues.</i>

14:19.434 --> 14:22.085
He actually, uh, signed him up
for this online class,

14:22.087 --> 14:24.103
but then Shrub sent the teacher

14:24.105 --> 14:26.105
a bunch
of middle finger emojis,

14:26.107 --> 14:27.490
so that was that.

14:30.778 --> 14:32.929
(phone ringing)

14:32.931 --> 14:35.522
Wait.

14:35.524 --> 14:37.767
Levi?

14:37.769 --> 14:40.587
What?
Now?

14:44.551 --> 14:45.958
Ugh!

14:45.960 --> 14:47.443
They moved
skillet toss time up!

14:47.445 --> 14:48.219
What?

14:48.221 --> 14:51.038
They moved skillet toss
time up!

14:51.040 --> 14:52.949
-Why?
-More people signed up.

14:52.951 --> 14:55.618
Oh, my God!
No, puddle, ah!

14:55.620 --> 14:57.729
(laughs)

14:57.731 --> 14:59.789
Well, I'm young
at heart, you know?

14:59.791 --> 15:02.792
(laughs)
How old are you?

15:02.794 --> 15:05.628
June, who just signed up?

15:05.630 --> 15:07.480
NADINE: It was I.

15:07.482 --> 15:08.740
Oh, my God.

15:08.742 --> 15:10.557
I thought it was someone
who could actually beat me.

15:10.559 --> 15:13.394
Oh, Nadine beats Kelly
at, like, everything.

15:13.396 --> 15:16.080
In second grade,
it was Little Miss Flatch.

15:16.082 --> 15:19.675
In fourth grade, she won
the pie eating contest...

15:19.677 --> 15:21.160
against Kelly.

15:21.162 --> 15:23.254
And then eighth grade,

15:23.256 --> 15:25.314
Kelly asked Dylan Parney
to the school dance,

15:25.316 --> 15:27.984
and then he married Nadine.

15:27.986 --> 15:29.410
Okay, Kelly,
Maybe if you had a job,

15:29.412 --> 15:32.079
winning a little contest
wouldn't matter so much.

15:32.081 --> 15:33.247
I have a job.
I'm an influencer.

15:33.249 --> 15:34.323
Heard of it?

15:34.417 --> 15:36.842
Oh, that's great.
Who are you influencing?

15:36.844 --> 15:39.845
Uh, Levi, Nathan S,
Nathan G for starters.

15:39.847 --> 15:41.088
NADINE: Oh, the little kids.

15:41.090 --> 15:42.848
Hey, somebody's ready
for their lunch.

15:42.850 --> 15:44.091
Okay, well,

15:44.093 --> 15:45.443
I left you a Lean Cuisine
on the counter, Dylan.

15:45.445 --> 15:46.778
I told you that.

15:46.780 --> 15:48.696
-I meant the baby.
-Oh.

15:49.765 --> 15:51.340
Hey, Kelly.
Good luck today.

15:51.342 --> 15:53.192
Good luck to you too.
Thank you.

15:53.194 --> 15:55.286
Okay, give me Chantal.
Dylan, careful.

15:56.473 --> 15:59.031
Is she going to breastfeed
in the latrine?

16:00.018 --> 16:01.960
Last night she did it
on the StairMaster.

16:01.962 --> 16:04.337
-Wow.
-Yeah.

16:12.363 --> 16:15.223
Take as many potatoes
as you want, son.

16:16.884 --> 16:19.960
Uh, whoa, you fill out
your voting form?

16:19.962 --> 16:22.563
Let me see.
Shrub Mallet, first place.

16:23.966 --> 16:26.234
all: Oh!

16:27.970 --> 16:30.363
Get out of my field!

16:31.883 --> 16:33.549
Pass your ballots!

16:33.551 --> 16:35.994
You gave away
Mr. Piswall's potatoes?

16:35.996 --> 16:37.903
No, people went in
and took them!

16:37.905 --> 16:39.388
And he sold my pig
for 50 bucks!

16:39.390 --> 16:42.391
No, I--
Lester gave me money,

16:42.393 --> 16:44.485
and then the pig
followed him to his car.

16:45.154 --> 16:46.671
Shrub, I--
I'm going to need you

16:46.673 --> 16:48.064
to apologize to Mr. Piswall.

16:48.066 --> 16:49.582
Why don't you
apologize to me?

16:49.584 --> 16:52.159
Because you're the one who gave
me the wrong, crappy location.

16:52.161 --> 16:55.162
-Are you calling my farm crap?
-I am!

16:55.164 --> 16:56.997
I run a pristine venture
out there!

16:56.999 --> 16:58.424
Mm.

16:58.426 --> 17:01.877
And you and your friends
go in there and muck it all up.

17:01.879 --> 17:03.855
Look at this, Father.
Look at this.

17:03.857 --> 17:06.173
This was right
in the middle of my field.

17:06.175 --> 17:07.600
Oh, right, well, I have
no idea whose that is.

17:07.602 --> 17:09.152
Yes!

17:09.863 --> 17:12.697
Shrub, apologize now.

17:15.518 --> 17:16.701
I'm sorry.

17:18.237 --> 17:20.763
-[bleep] happy now?
-Oh, that's it!

17:20.765 --> 17:22.265
You're disqualified.

17:22.267 --> 17:24.858
God, you should be thanking me
for getting rid of that pig!

17:24.860 --> 17:26.118
It pooped everywhere.

17:26.120 --> 17:28.771
-Don't forget my 50 bucks.
-SHRUB: Diarrhea farm!

17:28.773 --> 17:30.548
(grunts)

17:30.550 --> 17:32.383
He means well.

17:33.053 --> 17:34.277
<i> KELLY: You were</i>
<i> totally robbed.</i>

17:34.279 --> 17:36.796
It's just I spent
three months making this.

17:36.798 --> 17:38.297
I spent all my money
on orchard grass

17:38.299 --> 17:39.965
-so my hay wouldn't get mites.
-I know.

17:39.967 --> 17:43.119
It's just like--Beth.
H-how's school?

17:43.121 --> 17:44.804
-Sanitary.
-SHRUB: Oh.

17:44.806 --> 17:46.230
Hey, bro, let me
help you with that!

17:46.232 --> 17:49.734
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Are you kidding me, Mickey?

17:49.736 --> 17:51.885
-What?
-God!

17:51.887 --> 17:53.145
See you tonight!
Party at my place!

17:53.147 --> 17:55.331
Yeah, I'm not coming over!

17:55.333 --> 17:58.058
Hey, those potatoes
had worms.

17:58.060 --> 18:00.078
Screw you.
They were free!

18:00.080 --> 18:02.080
This whole town
has it out for me!

18:02.082 --> 18:02.914
See?

18:03.065 --> 18:04.415
Mallets have
enemies everywhere.

18:04.417 --> 18:07.143
<i> CHERYL: Five minutes</i>

18:07.145 --> 18:08.902
Okay, I'm gonna show them.
Let's go!

18:08.904 --> 18:10.237
Hey, hey, put on
your other shoe!

18:10.239 --> 18:11.314
Copy that!

18:11.407 --> 18:13.240
Hey, June,
have you seen Shrub anywhere?

18:13.242 --> 18:15.000
I'm afraid I haven't.
Is something wrong?

18:15.002 --> 18:16.502
Yeah, there was a mix-up.

18:16.504 --> 18:18.262
I ran into Mrs. Wicks,
and it turns out

18:18.264 --> 18:20.414
she had given Shrub
your location.

18:20.416 --> 18:22.325
She wrote it on the back
of her pill prescription,

18:22.327 --> 18:24.102
and then she forgot
to take her pills.

18:24.104 --> 18:27.271
Oh, dear, not again.
Let me go ask Bessie.

18:29.258 --> 18:32.685
Joe, can you please change
your Tinder profile pic

18:32.687 --> 18:33.853
from the one I took of you?

18:33.855 --> 18:35.004
That is just cruel.

18:35.006 --> 18:36.114
You're on Tinder?

18:36.116 --> 18:38.341
Yes, Joe,
I<i> am</i> single now too.

18:38.343 --> 18:40.118
Wait, were you the picture
of the Siamese cat

18:40.120 --> 18:42.361
in the overalls
that swiped right on me?

18:42.363 --> 18:43.663
Mm-mm.

18:47.943 --> 18:49.276
(cowbell rings)

18:49.278 --> 18:52.855
Okay, let's give it up
for Mandy Matthews.

18:52.857 --> 18:54.781
(cheers and applause)

18:54.783 --> 18:56.467
Go, Mandy!

18:56.469 --> 18:59.195
<i> MANDY: There's three things</i>
<i> that get me focused:</i>

18:59.197 --> 19:01.030
a spicy meat stick,

19:01.032 --> 19:03.048
my man Garth Brooks, here,

19:03.050 --> 19:05.351
and the third thing
is proprietary.

19:13.561 --> 19:14.468
all: Ooh!

19:14.470 --> 19:15.895
(cheers and applause)

19:15.897 --> 19:20.383
CHERYL: That was a big one!
Looks like that is 32 feet.

19:20.385 --> 19:22.827
-And 2 inches.
-2 inches.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.887
Good job, Mandy, okay.

19:24.889 --> 19:26.998
And now we have Kelly Mallet.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.106
(cheers and applause)

19:28.108 --> 19:29.575
Raise it up!
Raise it up!

19:29.577 --> 19:32.670
(cheers and applause)

19:40.296 --> 19:41.846
-(metal clanks)
-MATT: (grunts)

19:41.848 --> 19:43.330
Oh, geez!

19:43.332 --> 19:44.590
FATHER JOE:
Get EMS, EMS!

19:44.592 --> 19:46.091
Is he dead?

19:46.093 --> 19:47.259
<i> SHRUB: Yeah, so the guy</i>
<i> Kelly kneecapped,</i>

19:47.261 --> 19:48.928
<i> like, best friends</i>
<i> with her dad.</i>

19:48.930 --> 19:51.080
<i> Like, they started a</i>
<i> construction company together.</i>

19:51.082 --> 19:53.749
This is, like,
bad optics, as they say.

19:53.751 --> 19:57.153
MATT: (groaning)

20:04.019 --> 20:06.204
-Yes!
<i> -KELLY: Yeah, Nadine won.</i>

20:06.206 --> 20:08.931
<i> SHRUB: Yeah, but, like, no one</i>
<i> saw, so, like, whatever.</i>

20:08.933 --> 20:11.024
Hardly counts.

20:11.026 --> 20:14.770
Skillet toss winner
goes to Nadine Parney!

20:14.772 --> 20:17.197
Okay, excuse me.
Thank you.

20:17.199 --> 20:18.549
-I have a speech.
-FATHER JOE: No.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.259
Thank you.

20:21.128 --> 20:23.128
Quite a throw, Kel.

20:23.130 --> 20:24.538
I didn't mean
to take out Matt.

20:24.540 --> 20:28.059
Hell, don't apologize to me.
Did me a favor.

20:28.061 --> 20:30.469
Guy tried to feel up Jessie
at the Reef last week.

20:30.471 --> 20:32.230
If you hadn't clocked him,
I would've.

20:32.232 --> 20:35.474
-Yeah?
-You got a good arm, kid.

20:35.476 --> 20:37.977
-FATHER JOE: First place...
-I got it from you.

20:37.979 --> 20:39.403
FATHER JOE:
For the scarecrow award...

20:39.405 --> 20:41.130
Yeah, you did.

20:41.132 --> 20:43.074
-(chuckles)
-But your aim's for [bleep].

20:43.076 --> 20:44.725
FATHER JOE: Goes to...

20:44.727 --> 20:46.059
the robot scarecrow.

20:46.061 --> 20:47.636
See you, Pops.

20:47.638 --> 20:49.229
(cheers and applause)

20:49.231 --> 20:52.733
FATHER JOE: Well deserved.
Great job.

20:52.735 --> 20:53.918
Great job.
Okay, okay.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.995
No showboating.
No showboating.

20:55.997 --> 20:59.331
Okay, go to the side.

20:59.333 --> 21:02.409
Now, I just want to give out
a special award to someone

21:02.411 --> 21:06.280
whose creativity was head
and shoulders above the rest.

21:06.282 --> 21:09.750
Has anyone seen Shrub Mallet?

21:09.752 --> 21:11.936
Shrub, you out there?

21:11.938 --> 21:14.087
(people panicking indistinctly)

21:14.089 --> 21:15.998
FATHER JOE: Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

21:16.000 --> 21:18.633
(fire crackles)

21:18.635 --> 21:20.002
Whew!

21:20.004 --> 21:21.279
Someone call
the fire department!

21:22.949 --> 21:24.431
Not helping, June.

21:24.433 --> 21:26.325
Someone call
the fire department!

21:27.862 --> 21:29.695
Oh, wow.
Oh, geez.

21:29.697 --> 21:31.030
(fireworks pop and crackle)

21:31.032 --> 21:32.515
People, focus!

21:32.517 --> 21:34.700
-Everybody, stay calm.
-(rocket whistles)

21:34.702 --> 21:36.961
(robot scarecrow screaming)

21:36.963 --> 21:39.112
(explosion)

21:39.114 --> 21:40.298
-(cheering)
-This is not part of it!

21:40.300 --> 21:41.707
(fireworks whistling
and exploding)

21:41.709 --> 21:43.301
Stop cheering!

21:43.303 --> 21:44.951
-(cheers continue)
-Stop cheering!

21:44.953 --> 21:46.787
Somebody could die!
Focus!

21:46.789 --> 21:49.348
(cheers and applause)

21:52.127 --> 21:54.294
Okay, it's pretty great.

21:54.296 --> 21:56.205
<i> KELLY: So they actually</i>
<i> ended up selling like a bunch</i>

21:56.207 --> 21:58.441
<i> of fireworks for</i>
<i> Fourth of July after that.</i>

22:00.227 --> 22:02.044
I mean, it was
a pretty impressive show.

22:02.046 --> 22:04.730
Hot off the presses.
Read it and weep.

22:04.732 --> 22:07.399
Beth is gonna want me
so bad now.

22:07.401 --> 22:11.144
"Local Man Fires Up Festival."
Okay, look at you!

22:11.146 --> 22:13.055
I mean, it's not
the front page, but--

22:13.057 --> 22:14.832
Police blotter's
always third page.

22:14.834 --> 22:15.833
You'll get front soon.

22:15.835 --> 22:17.726
Yeah.

22:17.728 --> 22:18.911
Where's Nadine's win?

22:18.913 --> 22:20.396
Uh, page five

22:20.398 --> 22:22.823

aides available."

22:22.825 --> 22:24.917
