03:11.358 --> 03:13.151
Why are they so important to you?

03:15.863 --> 03:18.115
Stories are all I have.

03:22.995 --> 03:24.580
And now I have you.

03:32.796 --> 03:33.797
I love you.

03:36.466 --> 03:38.677
I love you.

03:42.181 --> 03:43.807
You're every story.

04:24.890 --> 04:29.937
It is my distinct pleasure to
introduce to you Mr. Scott Landon…

04:31.271 --> 04:36.026
author of Relics and the Pulitzer
Prize-winning The Coaster's Daughter.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.986
Hey, we love you, Scott!

04:38.070 --> 04:40.614
Well, she's got that right.
We do love this man's work.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.326
There has never been a writer

04:44.409 --> 04:48.789
who has so seamlessly joined
the realistic and the fantastic.

04:50.082 --> 04:52.000
Scott Landon is a national treasure.

04:52.584 --> 04:55.546
Now, he's traveled all the way from
Maine with his lovely wife, Lisette…

04:55.629 --> 04:56.880
Lisa!

04:56.964 --> 05:01.260
…to inaugurate construction
of our own Shipman Library.

05:02.469 --> 05:05.514
It's the 21st century,
and the world has grown dark.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.725
But if every book is a light,

05:09.309 --> 05:11.937
then every library is a bonfire

05:12.020 --> 05:16.733
around which 10,000 people
come every day to warm themselves.

05:17.442 --> 05:22.197
I declare this construction project
open for business!

05:28.203 --> 05:29.204
Scott.

05:29.288 --> 05:30.497
He's got a gun.

06:54.289 --> 06:57.459
I love you.

07:30.701 --> 07:31.702
Shooter!

09:03.919 --> 09:04.920
Hello.

09:06.004 --> 09:08.173
If this is a telemarketer,
please take me off your list.

09:08.257 --> 09:10.801
Lisey? Lisey?

09:10.884 --> 09:12.761
Amanda?
Why are you calling my office phone?

09:12.845 --> 09:16.014
I-I-I tried all the--
the other ones in my book.

09:16.098 --> 09:19.643
But you have so many of them.

09:19.726 --> 09:22.855
Yeah, well when Scott was alive,
we needed a lot of 'em. But…

09:22.938 --> 09:24.982
Yeah, well this-- this was the last one.

09:25.607 --> 09:27.276
I thought you and Darla
were coming for lunch.

09:27.359 --> 09:28.610
We are. Darla's getting takeout.

09:28.694 --> 09:31.488
I was supposed to be there already,
but I fell asleep.

09:32.197 --> 09:34.616
Oh, that's you, Lisey.

09:34.700 --> 09:36.535
That's my little sister, Lisey.

09:37.953 --> 09:40.163
Was it-- Was it in Scott's study?

09:41.582 --> 09:43.834
Yeah. Did Darla tell you?

09:43.917 --> 09:46.003
No. I-- I just knew.

09:46.670 --> 09:49.256
'Cause he--
'Cause he's not dead for you, is he?

09:50.382 --> 09:51.717
Not even after two years.

09:53.177 --> 09:55.179
Hey, you okay?

09:55.846 --> 09:59.183
Charlie got married.
Did-- Did you know that?

09:59.266 --> 10:00.893
Yeah, I know. I heard.

10:02.769 --> 10:05.480
Yeah, to a little French postcard
up in St. John valley.

10:05.564 --> 10:08.358
Just-- A dirty French postcard, no doubt.

10:09.026 --> 10:11.737
Yeah, Darla told me. I'm-- I'm sorry, hon.

10:12.696 --> 10:15.365
And he was seeing her all the time
that he was seeing me.

10:17.492 --> 10:20.537
Hey, you okay?

10:20.621 --> 10:23.999
All of the time that he was seeing me!

10:24.625 --> 10:25.959
What-- What are you doing?

10:26.835 --> 10:28.420
What is that? What are you doing?

10:29.463 --> 10:31.089
What was that? Did something break?

10:31.173 --> 10:34.635
No, oh, no. It's nothing.
It's just my heart.

10:35.219 --> 10:36.220
Manda?

10:37.721 --> 10:38.722
Hey--

10:39.681 --> 10:42.518
Hey, Amanda? Hey, Amanda?

10:43.477 --> 10:47.898
Amanda! What's going on?
What-- Honey, what's going on?

10:56.198 --> 10:57.533
-Lisey?
-Hey, Darla.

10:57.616 --> 11:01.453
Just forget the takeout and get there.
'Cause I think she's doing it again.

11:01.537 --> 11:02.538
Jesus.

11:04.873 --> 11:05.916
Fuck.

11:34.152 --> 11:37.155
Good afternoon, Mrs. Landon.
I just happened to be in the area.

11:37.239 --> 11:39.032
All the way from Tennessee? I doubt it.

11:39.116 --> 11:41.910
Well, I just thought
I'd give it one more try in person.

11:41.994 --> 11:44.037
Try to convince you
of your late husband's papers.

11:44.121 --> 11:45.873
-They belong in the Shipman Library.
-Professor Dashmiel…

11:45.956 --> 11:47.165
-After all, he dedicated it--
-…I can't have this conversation now.

11:47.249 --> 11:50.127
I have a family emergency. Can you
move your car so I can get out?

11:50.210 --> 11:51.670
Please, Mrs. Landon.

11:51.753 --> 11:53.881
Scott Landon's reputation
has done nothing but grow

11:53.964 --> 11:56.466
in the two years since his untimely death.

11:56.550 --> 11:59.136
Now those papers, unpublished works,
they need to be collected.

11:59.219 --> 12:02.848
-Examined. This is hardly the job for--
-It's so funny. It's so funny that you--

12:02.931 --> 12:04.057
that you came today

12:04.141 --> 12:06.310
'cause I was just looking at your picture
in the Horlicks yearbook.

12:06.393 --> 12:09.813
A picture of the-- of the hero who--
who saved the famous writer's life.

12:09.897 --> 12:13.108
But I-- I think reality,
you ran like a rabbit.

12:13.192 --> 12:14.484
-Mrs. Landon.
-You came back, though,

12:14.568 --> 12:16.236
to get your picture taken
and to grab the credit.

12:16.320 --> 12:17.905
I don't care about that.
I never cared about credit.

12:17.988 --> 12:20.282
I don't care about that at all.
But you are not getting in there.

12:20.365 --> 12:22.576
And you are never going to see his papers.

12:22.659 --> 12:26.622
You were nothing but a restaurant hostess
when you caught his eye.

12:26.705 --> 12:28.624
The fact that you slept in his bed

12:28.707 --> 12:31.543
does not give you the right
to withhold his unwritten papers

12:31.627 --> 12:33.212
from the rest of the world.

12:33.295 --> 12:34.713
Oh, my God.

12:35.714 --> 12:37.174
Fuck you.

12:40.010 --> 12:42.638
Fuck you. I'm calling the cops.

12:42.721 --> 12:44.890
-Mrs. Landon.
-If you don't wanna spend a night in jail,

12:44.973 --> 12:46.934
you better be gone
by the time they get here.

12:47.434 --> 12:48.435
Mrs. Landon.

12:51.688 --> 12:52.856
Mrs. Landon.

13:00.822 --> 13:02.115
Get out of my way.

13:35.524 --> 13:37.359
Jim? Roger Dashmiel here.

13:40.320 --> 13:44.783
Can you-- Hey, were you--
Were you in the pool this morning?

13:47.077 --> 13:49.705
I don't know, but Scott-- Scott knew
about the other pool, didn't he?

13:49.788 --> 13:51.039
He did. He knew.

13:54.168 --> 13:59.756
You don't-- You-- You know.
You know, but you-- you lie to yourself.

13:59.840 --> 14:03.677
You lie to yourself. And that's--
that's a talent that I've never had.

14:39.963 --> 14:41.173
Manda!

14:44.218 --> 14:45.385
Manda!

14:53.519 --> 14:54.686
Manda!

14:58.732 --> 15:01.276
Jesus. Jesus, Manda. What happened?

15:04.321 --> 15:05.322
You okay?

15:05.989 --> 15:06.990
Fuck.

15:38.146 --> 15:42.067
She's in her bedroom. I practically had
to carry her up. And you weren't here.

15:42.150 --> 15:44.278
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I-- I just had to deal with something.

15:44.361 --> 15:45.362
It's okay.

15:46.321 --> 15:48.156
What's that smell? Is something burning?

15:48.240 --> 15:50.450
It's fucking mac and cheese.

15:51.118 --> 15:52.619
Is she taking her pills?

15:52.703 --> 15:55.831
There's four empty bottles in the trash.
I think she flushed 'em.

15:56.832 --> 16:00.335
-She talking? Or is it like before--
-Like last time? No. Not yet.

16:00.419 --> 16:03.172
I mean, we're not at-- Not right now.

16:11.555 --> 16:12.681
Manda?

16:15.726 --> 16:18.145
She had plenty to say
when I was cleaning her up.

16:18.854 --> 16:22.274
Hey, big sissa Manda-Bunny?

16:26.653 --> 16:28.155
Poor Amanda.

16:37.581 --> 16:39.625
-Lisey? Lisey?
-Yeah.

16:48.717 --> 16:50.469
Blood doesn't come out once it's set.

16:50.928 --> 16:51.929
Yeah, I know.

16:52.971 --> 16:55.265
-Did she eat anything?
-Not a bite.

16:55.349 --> 16:57.017
This is how she was last time, remember?

16:57.100 --> 16:59.269
She came out of it then.
She'll come out of it now.

16:59.353 --> 17:01.730
-Scott helped her the last time.
-Yeah.

17:01.813 --> 17:03.357
We should probably get her to the ER.

17:03.440 --> 17:04.816
No, no, no. Just-- Let's wait.

17:04.900 --> 17:07.778
I'll stay with her tonight
and we'll see how she is in the morning.

17:08.278 --> 17:10.739
-You sure?
-Yeah. Yeah, it's my turn.

17:15.536 --> 17:16.994
When does Matt get back from Canada?

17:17.871 --> 17:21.165
Not for another two weeks.
I wish he'd stay away forever.

17:23.252 --> 17:24.461
I don't know. I'm sorry.

17:26.922 --> 17:28.298
It's okay, you're tired.

17:29.800 --> 17:30.801
Are you okay?

17:30.884 --> 17:33.095
Yeah. I don't wanna--
I don't wanna go home anyway

17:33.178 --> 17:34.721
'cause that idiot, Dashmiel, was there.

17:34.805 --> 17:37.891
-Well, call me if she gets worse.
-I will.

17:38.559 --> 17:41.645
She's a troublesome old cow,
but I love her.

17:43.772 --> 17:46.525
Yeah. You're stuck with love, aren't ya?

18:07.129 --> 18:09.631
What did Scott do
the last time you were like this?

18:12.718 --> 18:14.344
He must have done something.

18:16.388 --> 18:18.390
Just tell me what to do…

18:20.475 --> 18:21.935
and I'll do it.

18:23.353 --> 18:26.899
I want… some cocoa.

18:29.902 --> 18:34.031
Okay, Manda-Bunny.
I'll get you some cocoa.

18:39.203 --> 18:40.454
Amanda?

18:47.419 --> 18:48.629
Amanda?

18:56.512 --> 18:58.055
Lisey wanted to come.

19:02.017 --> 19:05.354
I said no. Not this time.

19:07.564 --> 19:09.608
This is just between us.

19:20.369 --> 19:22.746
I learned it a long time ago.

19:24.289 --> 19:25.499
When I was a kid.

19:36.260 --> 19:39.304
This is just between us.

20:03.245 --> 20:04.580
You feel better, right?

20:06.331 --> 20:07.499
It's from the pool.

20:09.001 --> 20:10.460
There's nothing like it.

20:11.712 --> 20:13.213
At least not in this world.

20:17.009 --> 20:20.888
We have to talk… about Lisey.

20:22.389 --> 20:25.058
Okay. Okay.

20:42.576 --> 20:43.994
Hey, Jim.

20:46.163 --> 20:48.582
Yoko Landon still won't give up the goods?

20:49.333 --> 20:51.251
Well, she's being--

20:51.335 --> 20:52.711
A bitch.

20:52.794 --> 20:54.922
Impolitic, but not wrong.

20:55.422 --> 20:57.883
I'm starting to think
she wants him forgotten.

20:57.966 --> 21:00.802
That can't happen. You agree?

21:01.929 --> 21:03.430
You know I do.

21:04.264 --> 21:08.769
You remember that conversation we had
about applying a little pressure?

21:09.436 --> 21:11.647
You said you were good
at persuading people.

21:14.233 --> 21:16.777
Yeah, I am, Roger. Believe me.

21:18.111 --> 21:20.072
And helping 'em understand.

21:20.739 --> 21:22.157
It's just so important.

21:22.783 --> 21:26.078
Unpublished Landon short stories,
maybe even a novel.

21:26.161 --> 21:29.122
Think of it, Jim.
And she's sitting on it like a broody hen.

21:30.082 --> 21:31.291
I can help you out.

21:31.917 --> 21:33.794
You really think you can?

21:35.128 --> 21:36.213
Oh, yeah.

21:36.296 --> 21:38.966
I can't pay you much.
I'm hardly a rich man.

21:42.219 --> 21:44.596
Don't you worry about that, prof.

21:46.056 --> 21:47.724
Scott Landon is life.

21:49.476 --> 21:51.103
His books changed me.

21:52.771 --> 21:54.606
I'll get those papers for you.

21:56.275 --> 21:58.360
No woman gonna say no to me.

22:00.737 --> 22:05.033
-This is hot, so I'm gonna hold it--
-Scott gave me a drink, but not cocoa.

22:05.826 --> 22:08.996
It was cool water. Beautiful water.

22:09.746 --> 22:13.584
He said it was from the pool.
The one in Booya Moon.

22:15.711 --> 22:16.712
What pool?

22:16.795 --> 22:19.756
Only who's gonna…
give me a drink this time?

22:24.803 --> 22:26.722
It was the sweetest water I ever had.

22:27.347 --> 22:29.892
Little Lisey, I wish I had some more.

22:29.975 --> 22:32.311
But he said that the pool…

22:33.812 --> 22:35.189
is dangerous.

22:35.272 --> 22:37.441
You'd look at it
and you don't wanna look away.

22:38.317 --> 22:39.818
What pool?

22:39.902 --> 22:42.738
You know what I'm talking about, Lisey.

22:42.821 --> 22:45.908
You don't want to remember…
but you have to.

22:46.325 --> 22:47.951
He left you a bool hunt.

22:49.161 --> 22:52.789
He told me that. The day that
he gave me my drink, he told me.

22:52.873 --> 22:54.249
He said it's like…

22:55.501 --> 22:57.628
a treasure hunt.

22:59.046 --> 23:00.339
Treasure hunt.

23:02.466 --> 23:03.926
Did you find the first clue?

23:06.428 --> 23:08.305
I'll tell you because he told me.

23:08.388 --> 23:12.726
It's the silver shovel
that you saved him with.

23:13.310 --> 23:17.731
And he said that you would
see it even before you saw it.

23:18.524 --> 23:19.691
Did you?

23:21.151 --> 23:22.152
Yes.

23:24.071 --> 23:27.115
He left another clue
and he said that you would figure it out.

23:28.492 --> 23:31.745
He was special. He was special.

23:31.828 --> 23:32.829
Amanda?

23:32.913 --> 23:36.375
-I know sometimes he just went away, poof.
-Amanda?

23:36.458 --> 23:39.086
Nobody could disappear like Scott Landon.

23:39.169 --> 23:40.546
Amanda, what is it?

23:40.629 --> 23:41.630
No.

23:54.017 --> 23:58.480
You solve all the riddles,
find all the clues…

24:00.732 --> 24:02.317
then you get a prize.

24:04.069 --> 24:06.113
You must have loved it a lot.

24:07.614 --> 24:08.699
I did.

24:10.784 --> 24:12.411
But I love you even more.

24:14.371 --> 24:15.372
You do?

24:16.790 --> 24:18.000
I do.

24:20.586 --> 24:22.087
I love you too.

24:34.600 --> 24:37.186
-You know--
-Shut the fuck up.

24:38.187 --> 24:42.065
You know. You know.

25:09.343 --> 25:12.763
It makes a sound.

25:31.949 --> 25:35.244
Needless to say,
that lecture has been canceled.

25:35.327 --> 25:37.079
Recapping our top story,

25:37.162 --> 25:41.750
best-selling writer, Scott Landon, was
shot this afternoon on the Horlicks campus

25:41.834 --> 25:44.002
and was taken to Sacred Heart Hospital

25:44.086 --> 25:46.463
where he is listed to be
in critical condition.

25:47.631 --> 25:50.634
Your husband's condition is serious,
but he's stable.

25:51.343 --> 25:54.221
We may even be able to save his lung.
It was only a .22, thank God.

25:54.304 --> 25:56.473
-That was more than enough.
-I only meant--

25:56.557 --> 25:59.518
No, I know. I know what you meant,
thank you. Thank you.

25:59.601 --> 26:01.186
Is he really gonna be okay?

26:01.687 --> 26:05.732
That's a promise I never make,
but his odds are good.

26:05.816 --> 26:08.026
There will be a long period
of recovery, of course.

26:08.694 --> 26:12.281
Maybe not as long as you think.
The Landons are fast healers.

26:14.241 --> 26:15.284
Can I see him?

26:15.701 --> 26:18.954
Of course. But don't expect to
have a conversation. He's on oxygen.

27:32.486 --> 27:33.820
Where did you go?

27:37.991 --> 27:39.034
You know.

27:39.952 --> 27:40.994
No, I don't.

27:45.916 --> 27:47.042
You know.

27:49.628 --> 27:51.713
Just tell me that you're gonna get better.

28:00.806 --> 28:02.057
I'm okay.

28:03.934 --> 28:07.771
-All Landons are--
-Fast healers, I know. I know.

28:12.734 --> 28:14.945
What happened to the guy who shot me?

28:15.571 --> 28:18.866
I don't-- I don't know.
I don't know, I don't care.

28:20.325 --> 28:22.828
I've been so afraid that
something like this would happen.

28:24.162 --> 28:25.581
Yeah, but most of them--

28:25.664 --> 28:27.332
Most of them love you,

28:27.416 --> 28:29.501
but it only takes one who doesn't.

28:31.879 --> 28:34.047
Scott. He's got a gun.

28:35.883 --> 28:37.301
You stole my mind.

28:37.384 --> 28:39.261
-Son.
-Thief.

28:45.184 --> 28:46.393
Lisey.

28:51.481 --> 28:52.524
Be quiet.

29:51.583 --> 29:53.293
Hey, babyluv.

29:57.548 --> 29:59.633
I miss you so much.

30:00.801 --> 30:02.469
You're on a bool hunt.

30:04.263 --> 30:05.264
Look.

30:05.347 --> 30:10.227
To convince myself
That this feeling just ain't right

30:10.310 --> 30:11.353
Oh, yeah

30:11.436 --> 30:15.440
It's too late to turn back now

30:15.524 --> 30:19.820
I believe, I believe
I believe I'm falling in love

30:19.903 --> 30:23.991
It's too late to turn back now

30:24.074 --> 30:27.286
I believe, I believe
I believe I'm falling in love

30:27.369 --> 30:31.123
Oh, yeah
I wouldn't mind it

30:31.206 --> 30:34.334
If I knew she really loved me too

30:35.836 --> 30:39.923
But I'd hate to think
That I'm in love alone

30:40.007 --> 30:44.678
And there's nothing that I can do, no

30:44.761 --> 30:47.097
It's too late to turn back now

30:47.181 --> 30:48.724
To turn back now

30:48.807 --> 30:52.102
I believe, I believe
I believe I'm falling in love

30:52.186 --> 30:53.187
In love

30:53.270 --> 30:56.857
It's too late to turn back now

30:56.940 --> 31:01.320
I believe, I believe
I believe I'm falling in love

31:01.403 --> 31:05.032
It's too late to turn back now

31:05.115 --> 31:08.827
I believe, I believe
I believe I'm falling in love

31:13.332 --> 31:16.168
Yeah, put your hands together
for these hardworking musicians.

31:20.255 --> 31:23.300
Ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Dave Debusher.

31:23.383 --> 31:24.551
Dandy Dave!

31:24.635 --> 31:26.637
That's right. Dandy Dave Debusher.

31:26.720 --> 31:28.055
And this morning I had the pleasure

31:28.138 --> 31:30.974
of giving away my daughter
to a man who don't deserve her.

31:31.058 --> 31:32.059
Daddy.

31:32.142 --> 31:36.021
But who may grow to--
who may grow to deserve her.

31:36.688 --> 31:38.732
Lisey says he's gonna be a great writer.

31:38.815 --> 31:42.444
Something about magical surrealism.

31:43.403 --> 31:44.655
I got my doubts.

31:47.074 --> 31:50.285
But Lisey says
he's got a contract on this book.

31:52.829 --> 31:55.916
And he's bound for the stars,
and that's good enough for me and Ma.

31:56.875 --> 31:58.877
He went on like that all night.

32:00.254 --> 32:02.214
Oh, he loved you, hon.

32:02.297 --> 32:03.423
He was drunk.

32:03.507 --> 32:05.926
Yeah. And he loved you.

32:10.055 --> 32:11.348
Why a bool hunt?

32:12.474 --> 32:13.517
Why now?

32:15.435 --> 32:16.812
What did your brother call it?

32:18.355 --> 32:19.773
Is it a blood-bool?

32:21.608 --> 32:22.609
It's coming.

32:25.696 --> 32:28.282
But right now
you need to take care of Amanda.

32:29.783 --> 32:33.453
Follow the clues and get your prize.

32:33.537 --> 32:34.538
If you'll just indulge me,

32:34.621 --> 32:37.207
I'd like to get this wonderful
young couple for one more dance.

32:37.291 --> 32:38.292
Come on.

32:38.375 --> 32:40.127
Daddy, we already-- we already did it.

32:40.210 --> 32:41.545
Come on,
let's give them a hand, everybody.

32:41.628 --> 32:43.881
Good lovin'

32:43.964 --> 32:44.965
Good lovin'

32:46.341 --> 32:50.012
I was feelin' so bad

32:52.139 --> 32:55.392
I had to ask my family doctor
Just what I had

32:55.475 --> 32:56.977
Look.

32:57.060 --> 32:58.812
-So I said Doctor
-Doctor

32:58.896 --> 32:59.980
Mr. M.D.

33:00.063 --> 33:02.191
-Doctor
-Won't you tell me, tell me

33:02.274 --> 33:03.275
Look at us, we're--

33:03.358 --> 33:05.944
-Tell me what's ailing me?
-Doctor

33:06.028 --> 33:08.238
Scott? Scott?

33:11.200 --> 33:12.326
Come back!

33:18.582 --> 33:21.084
Good lovin'
All I need is lovin'

33:21.168 --> 33:22.377
Good lovin'

33:40.312 --> 33:41.396
Amanda?

33:42.272 --> 33:43.649
Amanda?

33:44.775 --> 33:45.943
Amanda?

34:04.753 --> 34:06.004
Amanda?

34:14.263 --> 34:15.264
Manda?

34:19.268 --> 34:20.268
Hey.

34:20.893 --> 34:21.895
Hey.

34:24.898 --> 34:28.610
Hey. Big sissa, Manda-Bunny, hey.

34:28.694 --> 34:30.320
Let's go back to bed.

34:32.572 --> 34:33.782
Okay?

34:37.034 --> 34:39.454
We're closing, sir. Soon.

34:39.538 --> 34:42.748
Do you know this was Scott Landon's
favorite book when he was a kid?

34:44.668 --> 34:46.335
Finally got around to reading it.

34:47.004 --> 34:48.797
No, I didn't know that.

34:49.672 --> 34:51.967
Well, you must--
you must have known him, right?

34:52.050 --> 34:54.094
Didn't he pay for this library?

34:54.761 --> 34:56.096
I knew him to speak to him,

34:56.179 --> 34:58.473
but I-- I knew his wife better.

34:58.557 --> 35:00.809
Lisa. Lisey.

35:00.893 --> 35:04.479
Yeah, she used to come in often.
Sometimes she read to the children.

35:05.981 --> 35:09.318
Actually, I believe
it was she who funded the--

35:09.401 --> 35:10.819
No, the money came from him.

35:12.654 --> 35:14.364
Didn't it? Everything came from him.

35:15.032 --> 35:17.784
Well, I suppose so.
In a manner of speaking--

35:17.868 --> 35:19.453
Ain't no manner about it.

35:20.579 --> 35:21.997
Everything came from him.

35:23.207 --> 35:24.583
Four years old.

35:26.126 --> 35:28.629
Said it taught him
the power of the imagination.

35:28.712 --> 35:30.839
Oh. That's very interesting.

35:30.923 --> 35:33.550
The power of the imagination,
think on that.

35:34.426 --> 35:36.803
A seed was planted and it grew from here.

35:38.222 --> 35:39.723
You know how I found that out?

35:41.642 --> 35:44.978
I got it from my professor friend
who knows everything about Scott Landon.

35:45.062 --> 35:49.191
His name is Dashmiel. It's a funny name.
It could be in one of Scott's books.

35:49.274 --> 35:52.319
But I call him Scott
'cause I feel like I-- I know him.

35:54.821 --> 35:56.823
By their work shall you know them.

35:57.991 --> 36:00.953
Sir, I really have to close now. So--

36:01.036 --> 36:02.204
Dashmiel.

36:03.372 --> 36:07.918
Dashmiel, like you're hungry, really
hungry, so you have to dash for a meal.

36:08.001 --> 36:10.587
Get it? Dashmiel, "dash for a meal."

36:11.088 --> 36:13.799
You know, you should put this book
in its own special case.

36:15.133 --> 36:19.471
With a little plaque underneath that says,

36:19.555 --> 36:21.682
"Scott Landon started here."

36:22.766 --> 36:26.478
So it could inspire generations to come.
What do you think?

36:28.397 --> 36:29.982
Yeah, I think that's a good idea.

36:32.484 --> 36:34.778
Sir, I really have to close up.

36:37.573 --> 36:38.574
You could…

36:40.951 --> 36:43.579
put it right here so all the children
could see it every day

36:43.662 --> 36:44.872
and get inspired by it.

36:45.455 --> 36:47.457
Yes. I think that's a good idea.

36:48.917 --> 36:50.460
I think we'll do it.

36:52.421 --> 36:53.505
Well…

36:58.886 --> 37:00.596
we see eye to eye on that.

37:06.268 --> 37:07.644
Campers forever.

37:07.728 --> 37:09.104
Campers forever.

37:10.772 --> 37:12.191
Beam me up, Scotty.

37:12.274 --> 37:13.567
Beam me up, Scotty.

37:18.655 --> 37:21.950
Dashmiel, dash for a meal. Think on
that 'cause there's something there.

37:22.034 --> 37:23.035
I will.

37:23.118 --> 37:24.786
And put that book in its own special case.

37:24.870 --> 37:26.413
That's a fine idea.

37:26.496 --> 37:28.582
This place ain't here
because of that bitch he married.

37:28.665 --> 37:30.042
It's here 'cause of him.

37:37.299 --> 37:39.343
I said Doctor

37:41.512 --> 37:43.347
Mr. M.D.

37:44.723 --> 37:46.558
Won't you tell me

37:48.352 --> 37:49.937
What's wrong with me

37:54.483 --> 37:56.151
I said Doctor

37:58.362 --> 37:59.780
Mr. M.D.

38:30.269 --> 38:32.938
Okay. All right.

38:34.106 --> 38:35.482
We're gonna go again. Ready?

38:36.358 --> 38:37.609
Count of three.

38:37.693 --> 38:41.321
One. Two. Three.

38:41.405 --> 38:43.657
And-- Come on, babe.

38:45.033 --> 38:46.034
Manda.

38:46.785 --> 38:47.786
Mrs. Landon.

38:47.870 --> 38:51.081
Hi. Yes, this is Lisa. Lisey.

38:51.164 --> 38:55.711
Mrs. Landon, let me begin by saying
how sorry I am for your loss.

38:56.378 --> 38:58.547
Your husband signed
several of his books for me,

38:58.630 --> 39:02.509
and they are among
my most treasured possessions.

39:02.593 --> 39:05.345
Thank you, Dr. Alberness.
That's very, very kind of you.

39:05.429 --> 39:09.224
Now my guess is you are calling
about your sister, Amanda Debusher.

39:10.142 --> 39:11.226
How'd you know that?

39:11.310 --> 39:14.062
Scott would--
He invited me to lunch three years ago.

39:14.646 --> 39:17.816
He said his sister-in-law
had suffered a bout of self-harm.

39:18.901 --> 39:19.943
Yeah, cutting.

39:20.569 --> 39:23.906
Yes. Followed by semi-catatonia.

39:24.907 --> 39:27.826
He said he believed those behaviors
might recur. Is that the case?

39:27.910 --> 39:32.831
It is. But Dr. Alberness--

39:32.915 --> 39:34.082
Call me Hugh.

39:35.334 --> 39:39.630
He left your number
in Amanda's address book for me to find.

39:39.713 --> 39:41.173
Probably just a precaution.

39:41.840 --> 39:44.092
We toured the facility here
after our lunch.

39:44.885 --> 39:48.138
And I promised that if your sister
suffered the break with reality

39:48.222 --> 39:51.099
-Scott feared might come--
-That you'd find a place for her.

39:52.643 --> 39:53.727
Yes.

39:54.770 --> 39:56.563
He must have loved her very much.

39:57.231 --> 39:59.024
He loved both of my sisters.

39:59.983 --> 40:02.903
Let me expedite this situation
for you, Mrs. Landon.

40:02.986 --> 40:06.657
I-- I'd love to do something for
my favorite writer. And-- And his widow.

40:08.700 --> 40:11.161
Thank-- Thank you, thank you.
I really appreciate that.

40:11.245 --> 40:14.081
So if you'll just connect me with
your accounts department,

40:14.164 --> 40:15.582
then I can arrange for payment.

40:18.627 --> 40:20.712
Your husband arranged for payment himself.

40:22.005 --> 40:25.008
He said all I had to do was make a call
and the fees would be paid.

40:25.592 --> 40:27.302
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Thank you.

40:27.386 --> 40:29.763
-He was a generous man.
-Thank you. I appreciate that.

40:29.847 --> 40:31.473
Of-- Of course, of course.

40:56.373 --> 40:59.376
I should've told you this
before we got married.

41:02.212 --> 41:05.966
I don't wanna talk about
anything serious. It's so nice in here.

41:06.049 --> 41:09.970
Do you remember that night I cut myself
and you asked if I was crazy?

41:12.764 --> 41:14.057
I have visions.

41:15.559 --> 41:18.103
I write them down
and people pay to read them.

41:19.104 --> 41:21.857
But you're a writer. It's your job.

41:21.940 --> 41:27.571
You asked me about my family,
my daddy and my brother.

41:30.199 --> 41:32.326
And you said those were hard memories.

41:34.119 --> 41:35.204
They are.

42:10.697 --> 42:12.157
Take good care of her.

42:12.699 --> 42:13.784
We will, ma'am.

42:22.626 --> 42:23.961
How did he know?

42:25.379 --> 42:26.630
How did Scott know?

42:28.674 --> 42:29.675
I don't know.

42:45.774 --> 42:46.984
Hello?

42:47.067 --> 42:48.277
Mrs. Landon.

42:50.863 --> 42:53.198
Yeah. Yeah, who's this?

42:54.157 --> 42:55.409
Well, you can call me Jim.

42:55.492 --> 42:56.702
Jim who?

42:57.995 --> 42:59.079
How about Jim Dandy?

43:00.122 --> 43:03.500
Yeah, okay, I'm hanging up now, okay?

43:03.584 --> 43:05.711
Oh, come on, missus, I only want a minute.

43:07.713 --> 43:10.340
There's a man who came to see you
about your husband's papers.

43:10.424 --> 43:15.220
Oh, oh, okay. Yeah. Great. Great.

43:15.888 --> 43:18.807
You-- you-- you must
be a friend of Dashmiel's, huh?

43:18.891 --> 43:21.101
So is this a-- this a sales pitch?

43:21.685 --> 43:24.104
I guess you could call it
something like that, you see.

43:24.188 --> 43:27.816
-Yeah, no, I don't. I don't. I don't.
-Don't what?

43:27.900 --> 43:30.527
Because I thought that
I made myself perfectly clear.

43:30.611 --> 43:32.738
I mean, I thought I did. I guess I didn't.

43:32.821 --> 43:35.699
Maybe you and him didn't
get off to such a good start, but--

43:35.782 --> 43:38.535
Well, you could definitely say
that we didn't get off to a good start.

43:39.286 --> 43:43.165
Professor Dashmiel knows more about
Scott Landon than anyone else on Earth.

43:43.248 --> 43:46.752
God. He knows more?
So being married to him doesn't count?

43:46.835 --> 43:48.170
You don't think that counts?

43:48.253 --> 43:50.589
You don't know somebody when you're
married to them? That doesn't count?

43:50.672 --> 43:55.135
Maybe you do know that he said that
I was nothing but a restaurant hostess?

43:55.219 --> 43:56.220
What I mean to say is--

43:56.303 --> 43:57.888
Oh, God. Come on.

43:57.971 --> 44:01.725
Did I ask you to call?
Did I? Did I invite you to call me?

44:04.353 --> 44:05.562
No.

44:05.646 --> 44:07.731
No! No, I didn't.

44:07.814 --> 44:09.900
I didn't ask for this, please.

44:13.278 --> 44:15.405
Well, you're talking to me now
and not the prof,

44:15.489 --> 44:18.367
and I'm telling you you're
gonna give the prof what he wants.

44:19.826 --> 44:21.411
No ifs or maybe laters,

44:21.495 --> 44:24.414
you're gonna start by giving it to me,
and then I'm gonna give it to him.

44:24.998 --> 44:27.084
You had no right to Scott Landon.

44:27.167 --> 44:29.545
Not when he was alive
and not now that he's gone on.

44:30.420 --> 44:33.298
You never understood his greatness.
That's what the prof says.

44:33.382 --> 44:36.593
So you're gonna call him and
you're gonna tell him everything's okay.

44:36.677 --> 44:38.470
Yoko's giving up the goods.

44:38.554 --> 44:41.265
Yoko? Did you just--

44:42.516 --> 44:44.059
Did you just fucking call me Yoko?

44:44.685 --> 44:46.019
Now if that doesn't happen soon,

44:46.103 --> 44:48.522
I'm going to come to where you're at
and I'm going to hurt you in places

44:48.605 --> 44:51.233
you didn't allow the boys to
touch at junior high dances.

44:52.776 --> 44:53.777
Missus.

44:56.864 --> 44:58.991
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?

44:59.825 --> 45:00.826
Yeah.

45:01.618 --> 45:02.786
Mrs. Landon?

45:03.954 --> 45:05.122
Jim.

45:06.874 --> 45:09.543
-Yes, missus?
-Can you hear me?

45:10.460 --> 45:13.005
Well, you're a little low-pitched,
but yes, I can hear you.

45:19.678 --> 45:21.013
Go fuck yourself!

47:04.533 --> 47:06.618
-He's got a gun.
-Shooter!

47:06.702 --> 47:08.954
-A shooter! Gun!
-You stole my stories.

47:09.580 --> 47:11.248
You stole my mind.

47:21.175 --> 47:22.551
It's very close, honey.

47:25.345 --> 47:26.638
There's many faces.

47:26.722 --> 47:30.934
I don't understand.
I don't-- I don't understand.

47:32.311 --> 47:33.896
You know.

47:34.646 --> 47:36.106
You know.

47:50.287 --> 47:51.663
Long boy.

47:52.122 --> 47:53.540
Shut the fuck up.

47:54.917 --> 47:56.835
It makes a sound.

48:14.561 --> 48:17.606
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
That didn't happen.

48:19.233 --> 48:20.692
You know.
