00:35.800 --> 00:40.080
On September 3rd 1973
at 6:28pm and 32 seconds,

00:40.120 --> 00:45.120
a bluebottle fly capable
of 14,670 wing beats a minute

00:45.200 --> 00:47.480
landed on Rue St Vincent, Montmartre.

00:51.760 --> 00:55.880
At the same moment,
on a restaurant terrace nearby,

00:55.920 --> 01:00.600
the wind magically made two glasses
dance unseen on a tablecloth.

01:01.720 --> 01:07.200
Meanwhile, in a 5th-floor flat,
28 Avenue Trudaine, Paris 9,

01:07.240 --> 01:11.840
returning from his best friend's funeral,
Eugène Colère erased his name

01:11.880 --> 01:13.880
from his address book.

01:18.160 --> 01:22.000
At the same moment,
a sperm with one X chromosome,

01:22.040 --> 01:24.360
belonging to Raphaël Poulain,

01:24.400 --> 01:28.280
made a dash for an egg in his wife Amandine.

01:28.320 --> 01:30.320
Nine months later,

01:30.360 --> 01:32.800
Amélie Poulain was born.

01:37.520 --> 01:41.320
[The Fabulous Life Of Amélie Poulain]

03:13.360 --> 03:15.840
Her father, an ex-army doctor,

03:15.880 --> 03:18.240
works at a spa in Enghien-Les-Bains.

03:18.280 --> 03:20.160
[TIGHT LIPS = HARD HEART]

03:20.200 --> 03:22.080
Raphaël Poulain dislikes:

03:23.080 --> 03:26.920
Peeing next to someone else. He also dislikes:

03:26.960 --> 03:29.560
Catching scornful glances at his sandals.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.920
Clingy wet swimming trunks.

03:38.440 --> 03:40.440
Raphaël Poulain likes:

03:40.480 --> 03:42.640
Peeling off large strips of wallpaper.

03:45.520 --> 03:48.000
Lining up all his shoes and polishing them.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.120
Emptying his tool box,

03:51.160 --> 03:53.920
cleaning it out,

03:53.960 --> 03:56.880
and putting everything back.

03:56.920 --> 04:00.880
Amélie's mother, Amandine,
a schoolmistress from Gueugnon,

04:00.920 --> 04:02.920
has always had shaky nerves.

04:02.960 --> 04:04.960
[FACIAL TWITCH = WEAK NERVES]

04:05.000 --> 04:09.120
Amandine Poulain dislikes:
Getting puckered fingers in the bath.

04:09.160 --> 04:12.080
When someone she doesn't like

04:12.120 --> 04:13.760
brushes against her hand.

04:15.240 --> 04:18.480
Pillow marks on her cheek in the morning.

04:18.519 --> 04:22.840
Amandine Poulain likes:
Figure skaters' costumes on TV.

04:22.880 --> 04:25.960
Polishing the parquet with slippers.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.600
Emptying her handbag,

04:27.640 --> 04:29.360
cleaning it out,

04:29.400 --> 04:31.720
and putting everything back.

04:36.080 --> 04:37.840
Amélie is six.

04:37.880 --> 04:41.160
Like all little girls,
she'd like to be hugged by her daddy.

04:42.160 --> 04:46.040
But he never touches her,
except for a monthly checkup.

04:46.080 --> 04:48.680
The thrill of this rare contact

04:48.720 --> 04:50.920
makes her heart beat like a drum.

04:50.960 --> 04:52.440
As a result,

04:52.480 --> 04:54.480
he thinks she has a heart defect.

04:55.680 --> 04:57.880
Declared unfit for school,

04:57.920 --> 05:00.920
Amélie is taught by her mother.

05:00.960 --> 05:02.200
Four...

05:02.240 --> 05:03.320
hens...

05:03.360 --> 05:04.360
brood...

05:04.400 --> 05:05.840
here...

05:05.880 --> 05:08.040
henceforth.

05:08.080 --> 05:10.120
Four hens brood...

05:10.160 --> 05:11.680
Very good.

05:11.720 --> 05:14.200
...hens fourth!
- No!

05:14.240 --> 05:16.800
Deprived of playmates,

05:16.840 --> 05:19.360
tossed about
between a neurotic and an iceberg,

05:19.400 --> 05:22.440
Amélie retreats into her imagination.

05:23.760 --> 05:27.560
In this world, LPs are made like pancakes.

05:27.600 --> 05:30.320
The neighbor’s comatose wife

05:30.360 --> 05:33.800
has chosen to get all her life's sleep in one go.

05:33.840 --> 05:37.040
After this, I can stay awake day and night.

05:40.280 --> 05:42.920
Amélie has one friend, Blubber.

05:42.960 --> 05:47.520
Alas, the home environment
has made Blubber suicidal.

06:04.760 --> 06:08.720
Blubber's suicide attempts
destroy Mother's nerves.

06:08.760 --> 06:10.320
A decision is made.

06:10.360 --> 06:11.680
Enough!

06:44.200 --> 06:48.800
To comfort Amélie, her mother
gives her a second-hand Instamatic camera.

07:00.040 --> 07:02.480
Little girl! Look what you did!

07:02.520 --> 07:07.480
A neighbor fools her into thinking
her camera causes accidents.

07:07.520 --> 07:12.000
Because she'd been taking pictures
all afternoon, Amélie is petrified.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.880
She stares at the TV, racked by the guilt

07:15.920 --> 07:17.960
of causing a huge fire,

07:18.000 --> 07:19.840
two derailments

07:19.880 --> 07:21.680
and a jumbo jet crash.

07:21.720 --> 07:23.560
A few days later,

07:23.600 --> 07:25.360
realizing she'd been had,

07:25.400 --> 07:27.400
Amélie gets her revenge.

07:38.360 --> 07:40.560
What...?

08:07.280 --> 08:09.280
One day tragedy strikes.

08:09.320 --> 08:14.440
Amandine takes Amélie to Notre Dame
to light a candle and pray for a baby brother.

08:14.480 --> 08:16.760
Three minutes later, heaven sends,

08:16.800 --> 08:21.760
alas, not a baby boy, but Marguerite,
a tourist from Quebec,

08:21.800 --> 08:23.800
bent on ending her life.

08:26.320 --> 08:28.160
Amandine Poulain is killed instantly.

08:31.440 --> 08:36.120
After her mother's death,
Amélie lives alone with her father.

08:36.159 --> 08:40.039
His unsociable tendencies increase.

08:40.080 --> 08:43.400
He's obsessed with building a miniature shrine

08:43.440 --> 08:45.560
to house his wife's ashes.

08:51.320 --> 08:53.840
Days, months and years go by.

08:58.520 --> 09:00.520
In such a dead world,

09:00.560 --> 09:04.080
Amélie prefers to dream
until she's old enough to leave home.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.200
Five years later,
she's a waitress in Montmartre

09:17.240 --> 09:19.320
at The Two Windmills.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.160
It is August 29th.

09:22.200 --> 09:25.760
In 48 hours, her life will change forever.

09:27.560 --> 09:30.240
But she doesn't know it yet.

09:30.280 --> 09:34.760
She lives quietly among her colleagues
and the café's regulars.

09:34.800 --> 09:37.200
That's Suzanne, the owner.

09:37.240 --> 09:39.960
She limps a little but she's never spilt a drink.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
When she was younger, she was a circus rider.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.520
She likes athletes who cry with disappointment.

09:45.560 --> 09:50.360
She dislikes seeing men humiliated
in front of their kids in her café.

09:50.400 --> 09:54.200
Georgette is the tobacconist.
She's a hypochondriac.

09:54.240 --> 09:58.760
Migraines one day, sciatica the next.
She hates the words

09:58.800 --> 10:00.920
"fruit of thy womb".

10:00.960 --> 10:04.960
Gina works with Amélie.
Her grandmother was a healer.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.880
She likes cracking bones.

10:07.920 --> 10:11.200
She's bringing a kir to Hipolito, a failed writer.

10:11.240 --> 10:14.640
He likes seeing bullfighters gored on TV.

10:16.560 --> 10:20.920
Scowling at them is Joseph,
Gina's rejected lover.

10:20.960 --> 10:23.440
He's always jealously spying on her.

10:23.480 --> 10:25.160
All he likes

10:25.200 --> 10:28.040
is popping bubble wrap.

10:28.080 --> 10:30.440
And here's Philomène, an air hostess.

10:30.480 --> 10:34.320
Amélie looks after her cat Rodrigue
when she's away. Philomène likes

10:34.360 --> 10:37.160
the sound of the cat's bowl on the tiles.

10:37.200 --> 10:41.000
Rodrigue likes overhearing children's stories.

10:42.240 --> 10:44.680
No, thanks, ma'am. I never work on Sundays.

10:45.680 --> 10:50.200
At weekends, Amélie often takes a train
from the Gare du Nord to see her father.

10:50.240 --> 10:54.040
- Why don't you use your retirement to...?
- To do what?

10:54.080 --> 10:56.080
Travel. You've never been away.

10:57.680 --> 11:01.440
When we were young,
your mother and I longed to travel.

11:02.840 --> 11:04.840
But we couldn't.

11:04.880 --> 11:07.760
- Because of your heart.
- Yes. I know.

11:07.800 --> 11:10.080
So now...

11:10.120 --> 11:11.880
Now...

11:11.920 --> 11:14.640
Some Friday evenings,
Amélie goes to the cinema.

11:14.720 --> 11:18.200
I like turning round
and looking at people's faces in the dark.

11:24.480 --> 11:28.160
I like noticing details
that no-one else ever sees.

11:30.640 --> 11:34.520
But I hate it in old American movies
when drivers don't watch the road.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.040
Amélie doesn't have a boyfriend.

11:42.120 --> 11:46.280
She tried once or twice,
but the results were a let-down.

11:46.360 --> 11:50.000
Instead, she cultivates a taste
for small pleasures.

11:51.040 --> 11:53.400
Plunging her hand deep into a sack of grain.

11:53.480 --> 11:56.120
Cracking crème brûlée

11:56.160 --> 11:58.080
with a teaspoon.

12:01.880 --> 12:04.440
And skimming stones on the Canal St Martin.

12:43.720 --> 12:46.520
They call him the Glass Man.

12:46.560 --> 12:49.200
He was born with bones as brittle as crystal.

12:50.200 --> 12:52.520
All his furniture is padded.

12:52.600 --> 12:55.800
A handshake would be enough
to crush his fingers.

12:55.840 --> 12:57.880
He's stayed indoors for 20 years.

13:01.880 --> 13:03.840
Time has changed nothing.

13:03.920 --> 13:06.120
Amélie still takes refuge in solitude.

13:06.200 --> 13:10.640
She amuses herself with silly questions
about the world below,

13:10.720 --> 13:14.520
such as: "How many couples
are having an orgasm now?"

13:24.400 --> 13:25.520
Fifteen.

13:28.600 --> 13:31.240
Finally, on the night of August 30th 1997.

13:31.280 --> 13:35.720
comes the event
that will change her life forever.

13:35.800 --> 13:40.240
Lady Di, Princess of Wales,
died in a car crash in Paris last night

13:40.280 --> 13:44.040
with her companion Dodi Al Fayed...

14:32.800 --> 14:36.320
Only the first man
to discover Tutankhamen's tomb

14:36.400 --> 14:38.400
would understand how she felt

14:38.440 --> 14:40.560
on finding this treasure

14:40.640 --> 14:44.320
hidden by a little boy 40 years ago.

14:49.600 --> 14:52.040
On August 31st at 4am,

14:52.120 --> 14:55.040
Amélie has a dazzling idea.

14:55.080 --> 14:58.480
Wherever he was,
she would find the box's owner

14:58.520 --> 15:00.720
and give him back his treasure.

15:00.800 --> 15:05.360
If he was touched,
she'd become a regular do-gooder.

15:05.400 --> 15:07.320
If not, too bad.

15:13.960 --> 15:17.640
The girl from the 5th floor!
We don't see much of you.

15:17.680 --> 15:21.800
Would you know of a boy
who lived in my flat in the '50s?

15:21.840 --> 15:24.000
A boy? Come and have a glass of port.

15:25.680 --> 15:28.400
- No, thanks.
- Come in! Close the door.

15:28.440 --> 15:32.400
Boys? I've known so many.

15:32.440 --> 15:36.560
They're cute until they discover
snowballs and chestnuts.

15:36.600 --> 15:38.600
I've known so many boys.

15:38.640 --> 15:42.040
- When did you come here?
- In '64.

15:42.080 --> 15:44.720
You'll have heard the story.

15:44.760 --> 15:46.880
No, I don't think so.

15:46.920 --> 15:48.680
I'm amazed. Sit down.

15:50.320 --> 15:53.200
My husband worked for Ladybird Insurance.

15:53.240 --> 15:56.560
It's no secret that he slept with his secretary.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.400
They used every hotel around.

16:00.440 --> 16:02.080
Not the grotty ones, either.

16:02.120 --> 16:05.320
The bimbo liked spreading her legs,

16:05.360 --> 16:06.800
but only on satin.

16:06.840 --> 16:09.720
So my husband swiped from the till.

16:09.760 --> 16:12.680
A little at first, then 50 million.

16:12.720 --> 16:15.880
Off they flew to South America.

16:18.040 --> 16:19.040
Drink up.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.920
On January 20th 1970,

16:23.960 --> 16:26.280
my doorbell rang.

16:26.320 --> 16:31.200
"Your husband's been killed
in a car crash in South America."

16:32.240 --> 16:34.240
My life stopped there.

16:34.280 --> 16:37.320
And Black Lion died of heartbreak.

16:37.360 --> 16:40.080
Poor creature.

16:42.520 --> 16:44.520
See how lovingly

16:44.560 --> 16:46.520
he still stares at his master?

16:47.520 --> 16:48.520
One day

16:48.560 --> 16:50.000
I'll read you his letters.

16:50.040 --> 16:51.720
No, don't go!

16:51.760 --> 16:54.120
You can spare five minutes.

16:54.160 --> 16:55.760
He wrote this

16:55.800 --> 16:57.400
from the barracks.

16:59.880 --> 17:01.320
"Darling Mado." That's me.

17:01.360 --> 17:02.960
I'm called Madeleine.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.880
"I can't sleep, can't eat,

17:05.920 --> 17:10.520
knowing that my only reason to live
is far away in Paris.

17:10.560 --> 17:12.880
I won't see her until a fortnight on Friday,

17:12.920 --> 17:18.480
when my sweet little weasel
appears at the station

17:18.520 --> 17:21.480
in her strappy blue dress."

17:21.520 --> 17:25.400
In brackets: "The one you think
is too transparent."

17:33.600 --> 17:35.840
Has anyone ever written to you like that?

17:35.880 --> 17:39.800
No. I'm nobody's little weasel.

17:39.840 --> 17:42.320
My name's Madeleine Wells.

17:42.360 --> 17:45.320
Madeleine, like Mary Magdalene.

17:45.360 --> 17:48.720
She wept, right? And Wells as in water.

17:48.760 --> 17:52.800
Talk about being born to cry!

17:56.240 --> 17:58.000
About your question...

17:58.040 --> 18:03.280
Ask Collignon, the grocer.
He's lived here all his life.

18:04.280 --> 18:06.600
Hello, Amélie-mellow!

18:06.640 --> 18:09.080
A fig and three hazelnuts, as usual?

18:09.120 --> 18:11.800
Who lived in my flat in the '50s?

18:11.840 --> 18:15.680
- What was their name?
- You've got me there, dear.

18:15.720 --> 18:19.520
In 1950, I was two.
The mental age of this cretin.

18:19.560 --> 18:21.120
The "cretin" is Lucien.

18:21.160 --> 18:25.040
He's no genius, but Amélie likes him.
She likes the way

18:25.080 --> 18:28.280
he handles each endive like a precious object

18:28.320 --> 18:31.400
to be treated with care.
It's his way of showing

18:31.440 --> 18:32.800
his love of good work.

18:32.840 --> 18:33.840
Look at him!

18:33.880 --> 18:38.160
Like he's nursing a baby bird
that's fallen out of its nest!

18:38.200 --> 18:40.760
Don't ask him for currants!

18:40.800 --> 18:42.360
You'd be here till Monday!

18:43.600 --> 18:45.440
Get moving, spastic!

18:45.480 --> 18:47.440
She hasn't got all day.

18:50.160 --> 18:52.280
Here.

18:52.320 --> 18:55.880
Go and see my mother.
She has the memory of an elephant.

18:55.920 --> 18:58.000
Elephant Mum!

18:59.240 --> 19:00.680
Thank you.

19:18.400 --> 19:19.600
Bredoteau.

19:21.120 --> 19:22.120
Sorry?

19:22.160 --> 19:23.880
It's the name you're after.

19:23.920 --> 19:28.160
But if it's me that says so,
it won't count. I'm senile.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.080
Ignore him. He's senile.

19:31.080 --> 19:33.080
See what he's done to my laurel?

19:37.040 --> 19:39.600
His old job was punching métro tickets.

19:39.640 --> 19:44.640
For three months now,
he's got up every night to punch holes

19:44.680 --> 19:48.040
- in my laurels!
- I'd have preferred lilacs. Such is life!

19:48.080 --> 19:52.360
- We all need a way to relax.
- I skim stones.

19:52.400 --> 19:56.400
- You do?
- I'll find it. Don't worry.

19:56.440 --> 19:59.280
- I file everything.
- Like what?

19:59.320 --> 20:03.920
Your son's nearly 50
and I'm still doing his book-keeping.

20:03.960 --> 20:08.480
You were still squeezing his toothpaste at 15,
so it follows.

20:08.520 --> 20:10.800
Right. Camus...

20:10.840 --> 20:14.680
2nd floor on the right. Brossard...
Brossard was on staircase B.

20:14.720 --> 20:16.240
Got it!

20:16.280 --> 20:18.320
Bredoteau, 5th floor on the right.

20:18.360 --> 20:21.000
They were from the Pas de Calais.

20:21.040 --> 20:23.560
Bredoteau. What more can I say?

21:25.760 --> 21:29.200
Groping under the photo booth
is Nino Quincampoix.

21:33.480 --> 21:37.960
When Amélie lacked playmates,
Nino had too many.

21:48.640 --> 21:53.520
Five miles apart, one dreamed
of having a sister, the other a brother

21:53.560 --> 21:55.520
to spend all their time with.

22:16.280 --> 22:17.280
Hi, Dad.

22:18.840 --> 22:20.160
A new friend?

22:21.160 --> 22:23.280
No, I've had him for years.

22:23.320 --> 22:27.080
Your mother hated him,
so he lived in the tool shed.

22:27.120 --> 22:30.000
There. Let's reconcile them.

22:33.280 --> 22:35.280
There. Not bad, eh?

22:39.000 --> 22:44.240
Dad, if you found a precious relic
from your childhood,

22:44.280 --> 22:48.000
how would it make you feel?
Happy? Sad? Nostalgic? What?

22:49.040 --> 22:51.440
I didn't have this gnome when I was a child.

22:51.480 --> 22:54.960
He was a retirement gift from my old regiment.

22:55.000 --> 22:59.280
No, I mean something you hid
like a secret treasure.

23:00.760 --> 23:02.760
I should varnish him before autumn.

23:06.520 --> 23:09.040
I'll make some tea. Do you want some?

23:09.080 --> 23:11.080
Breathe in. Hold still.

23:13.080 --> 23:14.720
Better now?

23:14.760 --> 23:16.560
Shut the door!

23:16.600 --> 23:18.560
There's a howling gale.

23:18.600 --> 23:20.520
It's hardly Siberia.

23:20.560 --> 23:23.040
I can see you're not allergic

23:23.080 --> 23:27.560
to car fumes.
I almost coughed up my pleura last night.

23:27.600 --> 23:29.040
Coughed up a pleura? Sure.

23:29.080 --> 23:32.520
- What's on the menu today, Suzanne?
- Endives au gratin.

23:32.560 --> 23:34.920
They'll have you on your knees, you'll see.

23:34.960 --> 23:36.120
They're good, then?

23:36.160 --> 23:38.280
- Depends where.
- If it's at the toilet...

23:38.320 --> 23:39.560
Not good!

23:44.880 --> 23:48.680
12:15, laughs orgasmically
to attract alpha male.

23:48.720 --> 23:51.520
He's going to drive me berserk!

23:51.560 --> 23:55.160
Can't he give up?
There are plenty of other bars.

23:55.200 --> 23:57.080
Goodbye.

23:57.120 --> 23:58.320
Suzanne.

23:58.360 --> 24:00.200
- Suzanne.
- Yes.

24:00.240 --> 24:02.880
"Au gratin" means white sauce, right?

24:02.920 --> 24:04.480
Yes, why?

24:04.520 --> 24:09.360
I can't stomach it. Like you and horse meat.

24:09.400 --> 24:12.040
It's not my stomach, it's my memory.

24:13.040 --> 24:14.760
I'd rather cook human flesh.

24:14.800 --> 24:16.760
You're kidding!

24:27.440 --> 24:31.640
Suzanne, would you mind if I left early today?

24:31.680 --> 24:33.640
What's his name?

24:33.680 --> 24:35.680
Dominique Bredoteau.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.760
Hello.

24:43.840 --> 24:45.680
Are you Dominique Bredoteau?

24:45.720 --> 24:47.040
That's me.

24:47.080 --> 24:49.000
Why?

24:49.040 --> 24:51.040
It's about...

24:52.040 --> 24:53.240
...the petition.

24:53.280 --> 24:54.640
Petition?

24:54.680 --> 24:59.240
Yes. The petition to...

25:00.600 --> 25:02.440
...to canonize Lady Di.

25:02.480 --> 25:04.080
No, thanks.

25:04.120 --> 25:05.120
No.

25:12.600 --> 25:15.080
Ladies and gentlemen, sorry to bother you...

25:19.840 --> 25:21.920
- Yes?
- Hello.

25:21.960 --> 25:25.480
I'm looking for Dominique Bredoteau
for the European census.

25:26.600 --> 25:28.560
Come up. Third floor.

25:38.480 --> 25:39.480
Hello, kitten.

25:42.720 --> 25:43.880
Earl Grey?

25:43.920 --> 25:45.920
Jasmine?

25:46.000 --> 25:48.880
What will you have?

25:52.640 --> 25:54.000
I'm working.

26:02.480 --> 26:05.200
There. I'm coming.

26:05.280 --> 26:09.440
Do you know where I can find
Dominique Bredoteau?

26:09.520 --> 26:11.680
Oh, my poor dear!

26:12.760 --> 26:13.840
You just missed him.

26:14.880 --> 26:17.520
Look, there he goes now.

26:26.600 --> 26:27.560
Bre-to-deau.

26:29.040 --> 26:30.360
Not Bre-do-teau.

26:30.440 --> 26:32.200
You need

26:32.280 --> 26:35.600
a glass of mulled wine.

26:35.680 --> 26:37.400
Come in.

26:37.480 --> 26:38.640
Come on in.

26:41.560 --> 26:46.000
I've lived here for five years.
This is the first time we've met.

26:46.040 --> 26:48.680
I never go out on the landing.

26:48.760 --> 26:52.560
I'm fussy about who I meet.

26:52.640 --> 26:54.120
They're all creeps anyway.

26:56.280 --> 26:58.720
Come in. Here.

26:58.800 --> 27:00.120
Come in.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.560
They call me the Glass Man,

27:03.640 --> 27:07.040
but my name is Raymond Dufayel.

27:08.160 --> 27:12.280
- Amélie Poulain. I'm a waitress at...
- The Two Windmills. I know.

27:13.280 --> 27:18.160
And you've come back empty-handed
from your search for Bretodeau.

27:19.640 --> 27:22.760
Because it's not "do", it's "to".

27:22.800 --> 27:25.200
- Like "Toto".
- Thank you.

27:28.880 --> 27:30.520
I love that painting.

27:30.560 --> 27:33.120
It's the Luncheon Of The Boating Party.

27:34.800 --> 27:35.760
By Renoir.

27:41.400 --> 27:45.160
I've painted one each year for twenty years.

27:46.760 --> 27:49.360
The hardest part is the looks.

27:49.400 --> 27:55.240
I sometimes feel they deliberately change
their mood as soon as my back's turned.

27:55.280 --> 27:56.840
They look quite happy there.

27:56.920 --> 27:59.120
They should be.

27:59.160 --> 28:01.120
This year they had hare with morels.

28:02.320 --> 28:05.760
And waffles with jam for the children.

28:05.840 --> 28:11.120
Now, what have I done
with that piece of paper?

28:13.160 --> 28:18.320
Ah, you've noticed my video camera
at the window.

28:18.360 --> 28:20.920
It's a gift from my sister-in-law.

28:20.960 --> 28:23.680
I put it there

28:23.760 --> 28:26.560
so I don't need to wind up my clocks.

28:27.920 --> 28:30.440
After all these years,

28:30.480 --> 28:34.640
the only person I still can't capture

28:34.680 --> 28:36.880
is the girl with the glass of water.

28:36.920 --> 28:38.360
She's in the middle,

28:38.400 --> 28:41.120
yet she's on the outside.

28:42.680 --> 28:45.120
Maybe she's just different from the others.

28:46.480 --> 28:47.880
In what way?

28:49.480 --> 28:50.840
I don't know.

28:50.880 --> 28:55.880
When she was little, she can't
have played much with other children.

28:57.640 --> 28:59.840
Maybe never.

29:03.400 --> 29:04.720
Here.

29:04.760 --> 29:08.520
Dominique Bretodeau, 27 Rue Mouffetard.

29:09.800 --> 29:11.000
It's for you.

29:12.200 --> 29:16.960
Every Tuesday morning,
Dominique Bretodeau goes to buy a chicken.

29:17.040 --> 29:20.040
He usually roasts it
and has it with sauté potatoes.

29:20.080 --> 29:23.240
After carving the legs,
the breast and the wings,

29:23.280 --> 29:27.160
he loves picking the hot carcass
with his fingers,

29:27.200 --> 29:28.800
starting with the oysters.

29:31.840 --> 29:35.520
But not today. Bretodeau won't buy a chicken.

29:35.560 --> 29:36.960
He'll go no further

29:37.000 --> 29:38.600
than this phone booth here.

30:46.080 --> 30:49.280
In a flash, it all came back to him.

30:49.320 --> 30:52.400
Federico Bahamontes
winning the Tour de France in '59.

30:55.280 --> 30:57.280
Aunt Josette's slips.

30:59.720 --> 31:02.680
And most of all, that tragic day.

31:04.000 --> 31:07.480
That tragic day
when he won all the marbles at break time.

31:15.960 --> 31:16.960
Bretodeau!

31:20.000 --> 31:21.120
Bretodeau!

31:28.200 --> 31:30.480
The pinch, Bretodeau!

31:30.520 --> 31:32.520
Do you understand, Bretodeau?

31:39.920 --> 31:41.240
Cognac, please.

31:46.400 --> 31:49.000
It's amazing, what just happened to me.

31:49.040 --> 31:53.080
It must be my guardian angel.
It's the only explanation.

31:53.120 --> 31:55.480
It was as if the phone booth was calling me.

31:55.520 --> 31:57.840
It rang and rang.

32:00.240 --> 32:03.200
Same here. The microwave's calling me.

32:05.360 --> 32:07.360
I'll have another cognac.

32:15.680 --> 32:17.080
Life's strange.

32:19.480 --> 32:23.720
To a kid, time always drags.
Suddenly you're 50.

32:25.800 --> 32:27.800
All that's left of your childhood

32:27.840 --> 32:30.000
fits in a little box,

32:30.040 --> 32:31.440
a little rusty box.

32:34.720 --> 32:37.160
Have you got kids, miss?

32:42.080 --> 32:44.600
I have a daughter.
She must be about your age.

32:48.200 --> 32:50.120
We haven't spoken for years.

32:51.120 --> 32:53.960
I heard she had a child, a boy.

32:55.080 --> 32:56.080
His name is Lucas.

33:02.400 --> 33:06.760
I think it's time I looked them up
before I'm in a box myself.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.400
Don't you think?

33:16.680 --> 33:20.880
Amélie suddenly has a strange feeling
of complete harmony.

33:20.920 --> 33:26.640
It's a perfect moment. Soft light,
a scent in the air, the quiet murmur of the city,

33:27.920 --> 33:31.000
She breathes deeply.
Life seems so simple and clear.

33:31.040 --> 33:35.640
A surge of love,
an urge to help mankind suddenly engulfs her.

33:47.520 --> 33:50.040
Let me help you. Step down.

33:50.080 --> 33:53.000
Off we go!
We just passed the drum major's widow!

33:53.040 --> 33:55.920
She's worn his coat since the day he died.
Careful.

33:55.960 --> 33:58.960
The horse's head on the butcher's
has lost an ear.

33:59.000 --> 34:02.400
That's the florist laughing. He has crinkly eyes.

34:02.440 --> 34:05.400
In the bakery window there are lollipops!

34:05.440 --> 34:07.160
Mmm. Smell that.

34:07.200 --> 34:09.360
They're giving out melon slices.

34:10.960 --> 34:13.320
Sugarplum ice cream!

34:13.360 --> 34:15.920
We're passing the pork butcher.

34:15.960 --> 34:18.280
Ham, 79 francs. Spareribs, 45!

34:18.320 --> 34:22.960
Now the cheese shop.
Picodons are 12.90, cabecous 23.50.

34:23.000 --> 34:27.400
At the butcher's a baby's watching a dog
that's watching the chickens roasting.

34:27.440 --> 34:30.719
Now we're at the newspaper kiosk
by the métro.

34:30.760 --> 34:32.760
I'll leave you here. Bye.

35:22.120 --> 35:24.320
"She can't relate to other people."

35:26.440 --> 35:29.200
"She was always a lonely child."

35:32.040 --> 35:34.880
On a sparkling evening in July,

35:34.920 --> 35:37.680
while on the beaches holidaymakers

35:37.720 --> 35:40.200
relax in the new-found sun,

35:40.240 --> 35:42.680
and in Paris the sweltering crowds

35:42.720 --> 35:45.000
gaze at the first bursts

35:45.040 --> 35:47.600
of the traditional fireworks,
Amélie Poulain,

35:47.640 --> 35:51.240
godmother of outcasts,

35:51.280 --> 35:53.680
Madonna of the unloved,

35:53.720 --> 35:55.800
finally succumbs to exhaustion.

35:55.840 --> 36:00.400
In Paris' grief-stricken streets,

36:00.440 --> 36:03.160
a vast throng of mourners

36:03.200 --> 36:06.200
line her funeral route in silence

36:06.240 --> 36:10.520
with the measureless sorrow
of newly orphaned children.

36:11.520 --> 36:13.560
What a strange destiny for one

36:13.600 --> 36:14.960
who gave her all,

36:15.000 --> 36:20.440
yet took such joy in life's simple pleasures.

36:20.480 --> 36:23.960
Like Don Quixote, she pitted herself

36:24.000 --> 36:27.040
against the grinding windmill
of all life's miseries.

36:38.960 --> 36:40.960
It was a losing battle

36:41.000 --> 36:42.920
that claimed her life too soon.

36:42.960 --> 36:45.160
At barely 23, Amélie Poulain

36:45.200 --> 36:48.680
let her young, tired body merge

36:48.720 --> 36:52.000
with the ebb and flow of universal woe.

36:52.040 --> 36:58.040
As she went, she felt a stab of regret
for letting her father die

36:58.080 --> 37:01.520
without trying to give his stifled life

37:01.560 --> 37:05.640
the breath of air she had given

37:05.680 --> 37:07.680
to so many others.

39:18.360 --> 39:19.360
Wait!

39:24.200 --> 39:25.920
Wait!

39:28.680 --> 39:29.680
Wait...

39:31.000 --> 39:32.000
Wait, wait!

40:16.680 --> 40:21.840
Pages full of dud ID photos
torn up and discarded by their owners,

40:21.920 --> 40:25.400
carefully reassembled by some oddball.

40:26.440 --> 40:28.400
Some family album!

40:32.400 --> 40:33.920
A pack of Gauloises.

40:34.000 --> 40:37.880
Just a second. It's so smoky in here.
Can you tell me where they are?

40:37.960 --> 40:40.520
- I can't see a thing.
- More to the left.

40:40.560 --> 40:42.120
- There?
- A bit more. There.

40:44.880 --> 40:47.080
Thank you. You need change.

40:47.160 --> 40:49.440
Forget it.

40:49.520 --> 40:51.400
- Yes?
- A mauresque.

40:51.480 --> 40:53.840
A mauresque for the young man.

40:53.920 --> 40:57.160
One kir aligoté, one mauresque,
and two mint sodas.

40:57.240 --> 41:00.360
Was that prenuptial or post-coital smooching?

41:00.440 --> 41:02.400
Is your bullshit congenital?

41:04.360 --> 41:06.320
- Prenuptial.
- Don't worry.

41:06.400 --> 41:08.360
You'll find Mr. Right one day.

41:09.480 --> 41:12.600
All women want to sleep on a man's shoulder.
All of them.

41:12.680 --> 41:17.280
All men snore after a few drinks,
and I have a musical ear.

41:17.360 --> 41:20.920
I had an operation on my nasal cavities.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.960
I see you're a born romantic.

41:24.720 --> 41:27.360
I see you've never known true love.

41:28.640 --> 41:31.080
I did. It shortened my leg.

41:32.560 --> 41:36.840
- I thought you fell off a horse.
- I did.

41:36.920 --> 41:39.280
I was in love with a trapeze artist.

41:39.360 --> 41:42.480
I should have known.
They always drop you at the last minute.

41:42.560 --> 41:45.120
He dropped me just before my act.

41:47.160 --> 41:50.600
It floored me. And the horse.

41:50.680 --> 41:53.560
With me under it.

41:55.440 --> 41:57.680
The mauresque?

41:57.760 --> 42:00.560
Still, true love does exist.

42:00.600 --> 42:04.360
I'm not saying it doesn't.
After 30 years behind this bar,

42:04.440 --> 42:07.960
I'm an expert. I can even give you the recipe.

42:10.200 --> 42:12.840
Take two regulars.

42:12.880 --> 42:16.000
Let each think the other fancies them.
Leave it to simmer.

42:16.080 --> 42:17.880
It never fails.

42:26.480 --> 42:27.600
Excuse me!

42:27.680 --> 42:29.320
Excuse me.

42:29.400 --> 42:31.120
- I've had enough.
- I'll go.

42:34.640 --> 42:36.600
Haven't you hurt enough people?

42:40.280 --> 42:41.840
Gina can defend herself.

42:41.920 --> 42:45.040
I don't mean Gina. I mean Georgette.

42:48.120 --> 42:49.080
Georgette?

42:49.160 --> 42:52.120
Open your eyes! She craves your attention

42:52.160 --> 42:53.880
but you only have eyes for Gina.

42:56.040 --> 42:59.240
Poor girl! The things she does

42:59.280 --> 43:01.240
to catch your eye!

43:03.720 --> 43:05.680
You really must be blind.

43:14.040 --> 43:16.000
I'm off on a date. Bye!

43:16.080 --> 43:18.080
Goodbye.

43:20.280 --> 43:22.560
Whoever her new one is,

43:22.600 --> 43:26.040
he can't be worse
than that nut with his tape recorder.

43:27.200 --> 43:29.040
Joseph's not so nutty.

43:30.040 --> 43:31.720
He's just in pain.

43:31.760 --> 43:34.640
Come off it, Amélie.
They split up two months ago.

43:34.680 --> 43:37.840
To keep on coming here every day,
he must be a masochist.

43:37.880 --> 43:40.800
Don't say you haven't noticed.

43:42.440 --> 43:43.560
Noticed what?

43:43.640 --> 43:46.400
He always sits here, right?

43:46.440 --> 43:47.920
Yes.

43:47.960 --> 43:49.280
Sit down.

43:50.280 --> 43:51.480
Sit down, Georgette.

43:53.720 --> 43:56.680
- What can you see?
- My cigarette counter.

43:57.680 --> 43:59.800
And nothing's missing?

43:59.840 --> 44:00.800
No.

44:01.920 --> 44:03.320
Make an effort.

44:10.040 --> 44:11.840
I don't get it!

44:12.880 --> 44:15.360
I'll leave you to think about it. Good night.

44:31.400 --> 44:34.160
Good morning.

44:34.200 --> 44:37.560
Letter Arrives 30 Years Late.

44:37.600 --> 44:44.000
A mailbag found by climbers
on a glacier on Mont Blanc was part of a cargo

44:44.040 --> 44:47.480
lost in a plane crash in the late 1960s.

44:48.480 --> 44:51.840
So sad! A young, pretty princess for once.

44:51.880 --> 44:54.200
Would it be less sad if she were old and ugly?

44:54.240 --> 44:56.360
Of course. Look at Mother Teresa.

44:58.160 --> 45:00.600
Is he still chasing Gina?

45:00.640 --> 45:02.800
No, he's after somebody else now.

45:02.840 --> 45:07.040
- Anyone I know?
- Yes.

45:07.080 --> 45:09.400
Funny about this glacier.

45:09.440 --> 45:12.200
Somebody at The Two Windmills?

45:12.240 --> 45:14.280
Not you, surely!

45:14.320 --> 45:15.480
No.

45:16.640 --> 45:19.320
Not Suzanne.

45:19.360 --> 45:21.240
Surely not!

45:21.280 --> 45:22.920
Yes.

45:26.440 --> 45:29.840
- Look. There he is again.
- How strange.

45:29.880 --> 45:33.120
- And here.
- Him again.

45:33.160 --> 45:34.680
"Gare de Lyon."

45:36.480 --> 45:37.480
And here.

45:37.520 --> 45:39.120
"March 5th, Austerlitz."

45:39.160 --> 45:42.920
Always the same blank expression.

45:43.960 --> 45:45.400
Twelve times.

45:45.440 --> 45:48.280
I counted.

45:48.320 --> 45:49.600
It's very odd.

45:49.640 --> 45:54.400
Why keep taking your picture all over town
only to throw them away?

45:54.440 --> 45:57.160
Good ones, too.

45:57.200 --> 45:59.960
It's like a sort of ritual.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.120
Maybe he's so terrified

46:02.160 --> 46:05.400
of growing old, it's his only consolation.

46:07.160 --> 46:08.400
He's dead.

46:09.600 --> 46:10.600
Dead?

46:10.640 --> 46:13.360
Yes. He's scared of being forgotten.

46:13.400 --> 46:17.440
So he uses the photo booths
to remind people what he looks like.

46:17.480 --> 46:21.720
Like faxing his portrait from the afterlife.

46:21.760 --> 46:25.600
A dead man who's scared of being forgotten.

46:25.640 --> 46:28.720
At least these guys here have made it.

46:28.760 --> 46:30.800
They're long dead,

46:30.840 --> 46:34.600
but they'll never be forgotten.

46:36.840 --> 46:39.200
- The girl with the glass...
- Yes.

46:39.240 --> 46:42.480
Maybe she's distracted
because she's thinking about someone.

46:42.520 --> 46:44.360
Somebody in the picture?

46:45.920 --> 46:46.920
No.

46:46.960 --> 46:49.560
More likely a boy she saw somewhere,

46:49.600 --> 46:52.880
and felt an affinity with.

46:52.920 --> 46:58.840
You mean, she'd rather imagine herself
relating to someone who's absent

46:58.880 --> 47:03.400
than build relationships with those around her?

47:05.560 --> 47:06.840
No.

47:06.880 --> 47:10.880
Maybe she tries hard
to fix other people's messy lives.

47:10.920 --> 47:12.800
What about her?

47:12.840 --> 47:15.680
And her own messy life?

47:17.120 --> 47:19.120
Who'll fix that?

47:20.720 --> 47:24.120
It's better to help people than a garden gnome.

48:33.000 --> 48:37.960
The driver had 2.8g of alcohol in his blood!

48:38.000 --> 48:39.400
Makes me sick!

48:39.440 --> 48:42.280
Talk about employing irresponsible morons!

48:42.320 --> 48:43.560
Mr. Collignon.

48:43.600 --> 48:47.440
- You forgot your keys...
- Hold on, Amélie-mellow. Speed kills.

48:47.480 --> 48:49.760
Model yourself on Lucien.

48:49.800 --> 48:53.360
No radar will ever catch him
while he's working, will it?

48:53.400 --> 48:55.800
You shouldn't do that, Mr. Collignon.

48:55.840 --> 48:57.680
It's not his fault.

48:57.720 --> 48:59.400
True, Mrs. Cauchoix!

48:59.440 --> 49:03.280
It's not his fault he can't sleep. It's Lady Di's.

49:04.960 --> 49:09.160
Guess what I found in the truck.
A lingerie catalogue.

49:09.200 --> 49:13.480
He'd pasted Lady Di's face over the model's.

49:14.840 --> 49:17.040
What today? Five asparagus,

49:17.080 --> 49:18.960
or more local history?

49:19.000 --> 49:20.240
Nothing.

Thank you.

49:46.920 --> 49:50.680
Yes, but my sciatica kept me awake all night.

49:50.720 --> 49:54.480
- It's ages since I saw you looking so good.
- Really?

49:54.520 --> 49:59.440
A woman without love
withers like a flower without sun.

50:05.160 --> 50:07.160
Strange weather today.

50:07.200 --> 50:08.800
What's so funny?

50:08.840 --> 50:12.040
Everyone who's come in today
has given us a weather report.

50:12.080 --> 50:15.240
We pass the time of day
to forget how time passes.

50:15.280 --> 50:17.720
We do it to keep us from talking crap.

50:17.760 --> 50:20.320
I write crap but nobody wants to publish it.

50:20.360 --> 50:22.840
- Another rejection?
- My thirtieth.

50:22.880 --> 50:25.200
Isn't your cousin a book critic?

50:25.240 --> 50:28.160
Forget it! Critics are like leeches

50:28.200 --> 50:31.360
sucking the blood of writers.

50:31.400 --> 50:34.760
Is your book a love story?

50:34.800 --> 50:37.800
No, it's about a guy who keeps a journal.

50:37.840 --> 50:40.080
Not about what's happened to him,

50:40.120 --> 50:42.800
but disasters that might happen in the future.

50:42.840 --> 50:47.960
- So he gets depressed and does nothing.
- So basically, it's about a loafer.

50:49.000 --> 50:50.000
Suzanne,

50:50.040 --> 50:52.600
I'll dedicate the manuscript to you.

50:52.640 --> 50:55.720
He's only doing it so you'll write off his tab!

50:55.760 --> 50:59.760

That's sponsorship.

51:08.200 --> 51:09.600

- Yes. Yes.

53:39.960 --> 53:41.400
You're keeping well?

53:42.400 --> 53:43.800
Pretty much.

53:45.000 --> 53:46.880
I feel a change.

53:50.720 --> 53:53.600
I had two heart attacks
and had to have an abortion

53:53.640 --> 53:56.000
because I did crack while I was pregnant.

53:57.040 --> 53:58.560
Other than that, I'm fine.

53:58.600 --> 54:00.160
Good.

54:00.200 --> 54:02.200
Good.

54:03.920 --> 54:05.720

54:08.600 --> 54:09.680
No, nothing.

There.

54:33.520 --> 54:35.280
No explanation.

54:35.360 --> 54:38.440
Maybe he just wanted to see the world.

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:50.800
Enough! Enough!

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:53.680
Lucien, stop!

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:55.400
Very good.

01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:00.240
Mr. Dufayel, I found this under your mat.

01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:16.080
Still no win!

01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:18.120
Me neither.

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:22.040
May I?

01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:25.320
There's a little...

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:32.120
You're gorgeous

01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:33.800
when you blush.

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:37.080
Like a wild flower.

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:40.320
It's my dyspepsia.

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:42.920
Morning, all.

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:45.560
Beautiful day.

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:05.520
Pack of Gitanes, please.

01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:09.320
Bravo! Vive la France! You scalded me.

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:13.600
Bravo! Ten out of ten! Bull's-eye!

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:19.520
It was Amélie. She...

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:55.960
Do you know what happened
when they went up Mont Blanc?

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.360
The silicon in her face froze up.

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:02.720
Her face was a festering mass!

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:31.160
Mulled wine and ginger biscuits.

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:33.760
Thank you.

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:36.880
I was too hard the other day
on the girl with the glass.

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:41.680
Tell me about that boy she saw.
Did they meet again?

01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:44.160
No.

01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:46.920
They're into different things.

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:50.400
Luck is like the Tour de France.

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:52.440
You wait, and it flashes past you.

01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:57.760
You have to catch it while you can.

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:22.840
Can I help you?

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:25.920
Excuse me.
I found this album in the street and I...

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:30.360
Nino will be so pleased!
He was so sad the other day.

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:32.280
I almost prayed to St Anthony.

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:35.880
Is... Nino there?

01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:38.600
No. On Wednesdays he works at the funfair.

01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:42.840
How long has he had this collection?

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:47.160
Since I got him the job here, last year.

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:51.240
Before, he collected footprints.
He worked nights.

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:57.000
In the daytime
he took pictures of footprints in wet cement.

01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:59.120
He's a funny guy.

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:01.360
When we met, he was a Santa Claus.

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:06.080
Other things like...

01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:09.840
Whenever he heard a funny laugh, he'd tape it.

01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:14.840
Really?

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:19.120
Must be hard for his girlfriend.

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:21.400
He never keeps them long.

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:24.120
Times are hard for dreamers.

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:26.840
Eva! Where are those coffees?

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:29.240
I'd better go. Thanks for the album.

01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:32.800
It's OK. I've got time to take it to the funfair.

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:37.120
Suit yourself. The ghost train.
Ask for Nino Quincampoix, like the street.

01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:02.440
I'm looking for Nino. Is he here?

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:04.480
He doesn't get off till seven.

01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:08.280
- Is there no way to see him before?
- Sure.

01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:11.080
20 francs.

01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:20.680
See you next Wednesday.

01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:36.160
5pm tomorrow, Montmartre carousel
near the phone box. Bring a 5 franc piece.

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:55.560
Want to know about her?

01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:00.800
- You know her? You saw her?
- You bet.

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:02.760
She put us in her shirt pocket.

01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:05.279
Next to her breast.

01:09:05.359 --> 01:09:07.160
Is she pretty?

01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:09.080
Not bad.

01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:12.040
- Beautiful.
- No, pretty.

01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:13.359
- Beautiful.
- Pretty.

01:09:13.439 --> 01:09:17.080
- What does she want from you?
- She's broke.

01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:19.720
She wants a reward for the album.

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:21.960
Or she collects photos, too.

01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:26.160
She wants to trade us
for a one-eyed man with glasses!

01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:31.600
No, you dope!

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:35.359
She's in love.

01:09:35.439 --> 01:09:38.080
- I don't even know her.
- Yes, you do.

01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:39.840
Since when?

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:41.560
You've always known her.

01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:42.840
In your dreams.

01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:56.760
Hello?

01:09:56.840 --> 01:10:00.720
Yes. You! Man with the plastic bag! It's for you.

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:03.640
- Me?
- Yes.

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:07.800
Thank you.

01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:10.680
Hello?

01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:13.400
Follow the blue arrows, Mr. Quincampoix.

01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:39.480
When the finger's pointing to the sky,
only a fool looks at the finger.

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:50.000
Hello?

01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:53.280
I know the stranger in the pictures.

01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:57.240
He's a ghost. He's invisible, Mr. Quincampoix.

01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:00.520
He only appears when the film is developed.

01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:03.800
When a girl has her photo taken,

01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:09.560
he goes "Oooh!" in her ear,
while he gently caresses her neck.

01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:12.040
That's how he got caught, Mr. Quincampoix.

01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:16.880
Who are you?

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:18.320
Page 51.

01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:28.080
[DO YOU

01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:29.880
WANT

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:32.280
TO MEET ME?]

01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:09.000
Listen to this. "A boy of six,

01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:11.120
while his parents sleep, drives off

01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:12.840
in a pedal car.

01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:16.440
Found on a motorway
near Münster in Germany,

01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:19.920
he told the police he wanted to see the stars."

01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:23.480
Isn't life beautiful, eh?

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:27.920
Love. The only bug she hadn't caught!

01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:30.880
- Nobody's immune.
- At least it gives me a break.

01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:33.040
Love's a great beautician.

01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:38.480
What's she like? Tall? Small? Blonde? Dark?

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:42.800
Let's say... average height.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.920
Not a dwarf or a giraffe. Normal.

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:50.400
Pretty, for her type.

01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:52.680
As for blonde or dark...

01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:57.160
...it's hard to say, but she wasn't a redhead.

01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:59.000
- Unless...
- Forget it.

01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:04.760
I do remember she casually asked
if you had a girlfriend.

01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:05.800
And?

01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:08.200
I said you weren't interested, right?

01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:11.000
You didn't!

01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:13.200
What do you care? You don't even know her.

01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:18.240
- Exactly. It's the mystery.
- You won't find mystery here.

01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:20.400
A pound of nectarines, please.

01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:23.160
These ones here are the prettiest.

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:25.240
Trust him. He's an artist!

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:28.240
He's been going home every night
with tons of unsold stock.

01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:31.320
What for? Is he stewing a pig?

01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:33.440
No, sir! He's studying art!

01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:37.040
He sells leeks all day long
and paints turnips all night!

01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:39.080
The boy's a useless vegetable.

01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:40.560
A good prompter

01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:44.040
in each cellar window
whispering cutting retorts

01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:46.600
would mean shy people had the last laugh.

01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:49.000
At least you'll never be a vegetable.

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:51.200
Even artichokes

01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:52.240
have hearts.

01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:58.600
You'll never be a vegetable.
Even artichokes have hearts!

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:39.880
Memory seven.

01:17:56.840 --> 01:18:00.920
Darling Mado,
I miss you more and more each day.

01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:04.120
I'm an exile in a world of dreary khaki.

01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:06.360
I can't sleep, can't eat...

01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:09.000
This camp was the biggest mistake of my life,

01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:12.680
depriving me of my beloved
for five long weeks.

01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:15.480
I think of you endlessly. Your Adrien.

01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:21.760
I turned down my last month's wages
instead of giving notice.

01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:25.960
I dream of better times ahead.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.840
An orange-colored day. Remember, my love?

01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:31.880
Your ever-loving Adrien.

01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:34.960
Good news, darling Mado.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.200
Soon I'll be able to afford a car

01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:40.640
and drive home every night.

01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:44.920
Till then, meet me on Friday and we'll go out.

01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:27.160
[MOTHER]

01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:31.880
Psychiatric Helpline.

01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:35.360
Hello? Hello?

01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:05.280
[WHERE & WHEN?]

01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:16.960
One hour later at 11 Boulevard St Martin,

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.480
Amélie walks into a party goods
and costume shop.

01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:25.760
At the same time,
a man leaves his home at 108 Rue Lecourbe.

01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:31.240
26 minutes later, Amélie is at the photo booth
at the Gare de l'Est.

01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:39.240
Simultaneously,
the man in red shoes parks outside.

01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:42.520
The time is exactly 11:40.

01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:28.280
At this precise moment,

01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:32.880
only Amélie has the key
to the riddle of the mystery man.

01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:39.200
How's it going, Mrs. Wells?

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:42.000
It's always better when it's not raining.

01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:44.360
- This is for you.
- Me?

01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:57.440
Dear Mrs. Wells,
We recently recovered a mailbag

01:23:57.520 --> 01:23:59.480
that was lost in a plane crash

01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:03.040
on October 12th 1969 on Mont Blanc.

01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:07.400
We are forwarding the enclosed letter
to your address.

01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:11.400
Please accept our apologies
for the uncustomary delay.

01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:14.040
Jacques Grosjean, Customer Services.

01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:19.480
Darling Mado, I'm in exile.
I can't sleep, can't eat.

01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:21.160
I think of you endlessly.

01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:24.920
I know I've made
the biggest mistake of my life.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.560
I turned down that woman's money.

01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:32.360
If all goes well,
I'll soon be able to afford a house.

01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:35.320
I dream of better times ahead

01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:39.080
when you'll forgive me and join me here

01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:42.360
one orange-colored day.
Your ever-loving Adrien.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.040
Mr. Dufayel, another package for you.

01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:25.600
Mr. Dufayel, do you know
what happened to the concierge?

01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:28.240
She got a letter.

01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:31.960
From her husband. 40 years late.

01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:36.160
That's a lot, isn't it, Mr. Dufayel?

01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:52.160
I'm not big on still life, Mr. Dufayel.

01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:55.120
Then work on your thin layer.

01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:57.800
Fat over thin. Always!

01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:17.600
- Mr. Dufayel...
- Yes!

01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:21.840
The papers said
that there'll soon be a new star.

01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:28.720
- So you're into stars now?
- I saw it on TV at my mum's, that's why.

01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:32.160
I don't know if it's true.

01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:34.400
In America

01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:37.640
they're going to take all the rich people's ashes,

01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:40.240
put them in a satellite

01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:42.480
and shoot it into space.

01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:44.840
The satellite's going to shine forever.

01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:50.760
And Lady Di...

01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:52.960
Will they do the same for her?

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:53.960
Lady Di, Lady Di!

01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:55.240
Give it a rest!

01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:57.920
I can't concentrate.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:00.960
Lady Di!

01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:03.000

01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:43.360
Morning, sir.

01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:00.400
Cambodia.

01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:07.440
I don't understand.

01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:11.200
Brilliant! You couldn't have done better.

01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:14.320
- Did it work?
- It's getting there.

01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:17.160
Ask me again any time. The harm's done.

01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:20.720
- What do you mean?
- Everybody calls me Snow White!

01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:26.480
[The Two Windmills café from 4pm.]

01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:34.560
- Eva?
- Yes?

01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:38.200
Could you stand in for me at four?

01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:40.080
Again?

01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:44.680
Close the door!

01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:48.680
What's up with him?

01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:50.400
Is he sulking?

01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:53.880
- He thinks I smile too much.
- He'd rather you frowned?

01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:56.720
With other men, yes.

01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:03.560
Nino is late. Amélie can only think
of two possible explanations.

01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:05.600
Firstly, that he didn't find the photo.

01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:09.720
Secondly, before he could assemble it,

01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:13.880
a gang of bank robbers took him hostage.

01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:15.840
The cops gave chase.

01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:17.600
They got away,

01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:20.280
but he caused a crash.

01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:22.440
When he came to,

01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:24.080
he'd lost his memory,

01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:27.680
An ex-con picked him up,

01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:31.760
mistook him for a fugitive,
and shipped him to Istanbul.

01:31:32.680 --> 01:31:34.840
He met some Afghan raiders,

01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:38.320
who took him to steal
some Russian warheads.

01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:45.480
But their truck hit a mine
at the border with Tajikistan.

01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:50.800
He survived, took to the hills,
and became a Mujaheddin.

01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:53.680
Amélie refuses to get upset for a guy

01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:58.120
who'll eat borscht all his life
in a hat like a tea cosy.

01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:18.680
- What can I get you?
- A coffee, please.

01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:21.520
A coffee.

01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:44.040
Here's your coffee.

01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:46.520
Thank you.

01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:11.480
[Today's menu]

01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:21.520
He's understood.

01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:24.640
He's going to put his teaspoon down,

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:29.440
dip his finger in the sugar,

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.600
turn around slowly,

01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:38.640
and speak to me.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.920
Excuse me.

01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:48.560
Is this you?

01:33:54.760 --> 01:33:55.960
Yes, it's you.

01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:17.800
I'll take that.

01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:21.720
Another coffee?

01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:23.800
- No, thanks. I'm fine.
- OK.

01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:47.800
So it's this man here,
the one with his hand up?

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.000
Yes.

01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:55.000
Is she in love with him?

01:34:57.680 --> 01:34:58.680
Yes.

01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:03.760
I think it's time she took a real risk.

01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:08.120
She might just do that.
She's devising a stratagem.

01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:11.680
She's fond of stratagems.

01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:14.640
Yes.

01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:18.320
In fact, she's cowardly.

01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:22.880
That's why I can't capture her look.

01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:29.920
Dufayel's attempts to meddle are intolerable!

01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:38.040
If Amélie chooses to live in a dream

01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:42.120
and remain an introverted young woman,

01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:46.640
she has an absolute right to mess up her life!

01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:21.640
What are you doing, Mr. Dufayel?

01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:25.960
Tell me, Lucien.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:30.680
For deliveries,
do you keep keys to all the apartments?

01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:46.360
One of your booths is out of order.

01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:50.840
It seems to be jammed.

01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:54.120
Gare de l'Est ticket hall.

01:36:56.840 --> 01:36:59.120
- Buy a video, get one free.
- No, thanks.

01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:07.200
Sam?

01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:09.200
Samantha?

01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:13.400
Samantha?

01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:19.960
Can you stand in for me at...

01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:45.000
Photo booth, Gare de l'Est ticket hall,
Tuesday 5pm.

01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:48.240
[Can you stand in for me this afternoon?]

01:38:56.600 --> 01:38:57.840
Almost done.

01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:06.680
The mystery man wasn't a ghost
or a man scared of ageing,

01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:08.680
but simply the repairman,

01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:11.120
a normal guy doing his job.

01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:14.720
Sorry.

01:39:58.520 --> 01:40:01.720
He keeps spying on me!
It's making me sick.

01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:05.080
4:05: Blatant female conspiracy.

01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:09.360
Gosh, you're tense, Georgette!

01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:11.880
Good luck. You'll need it.

01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:21.440
Excuse me. Did you put this in my pocket?

01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:24.800
- Yes, but I'm not the one...
- I know. Where is she?

01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:26.320
She's at her father's.

01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:31.560
It's awkward. I'd like to speak to you, but...
I finish work at six.

01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:33.480
- Can you come back?
- OK.

01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:35.520
See you later.

01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:39.000
4:08: Docking scheduled.

01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:14.000
The blond guy in a camel coat.
He's very absent-minded, too.

01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:15.720
How come?

01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:19.080
He came back three times the same afternoon.

01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:21.480
1:12:

01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:22.760
Camel coat.

01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:24.040
2:50:

01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:25.840
Camel coat.

01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:28.000
- 4:17: Camel coat.
- Stop it!

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:32.080
My rash has come back! Look, Suzanne!

01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:35.680
My rash is back. He's driving me nuts.

01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:37.800
Lay off!

01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:41.960
If she had a clear conscience,
she wouldn't be in such a state.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:43.880
I've had it. I'm going home.

01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:47.280
Psychos are the last straw!

01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:50.560
Georgette! Georg...

01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:54.720
Stop smothering them!
Women need to breathe.

01:41:54.760 --> 01:41:57.920
You let them breathe,
they want a change of air.

01:41:57.960 --> 01:41:59.760
Fresh air's healthy.

01:41:59.800 --> 01:42:01.720
Shut it, failure!

01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:05.800
Failed writer, failed life...

01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:08.320
I love the word "fail".

01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:10.320
Failure is human destiny.

01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:11.880
It's gasbag time!

01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:15.040
Failure teaches us that life is but a draft,

01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:18.800
a long rehearsal for a show that will never play.

01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:22.400
I bet he stole that.

01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:24.840
I do have some original ideas,

01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:30.120
but people always steal them.
A bit like your women.

01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:32.120
Meaning?

01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:35.240
Meaning you'd better get used to it.

01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:37.720
Speak for yourself, you...

01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:38.760
What?

01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:45.360
- What's going on?
- Nothing much. Georgette went out.

01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:47.080
Joseph got mad.

01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:48.560
"Went out?"

01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:53.600
Just like Gina. You know who's she's with?
The guy with the plastic bag.

01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:57.520
I saw their little game.

01:42:57.560 --> 01:42:59.800
The note in the coat pocket,

01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:01.400
4:08.

01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:05.240
Back he comes, and hey presto!
Out they go.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:12.520
- I'm worried for Amélie because I like you.
- What do you mean?

01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:17.160
By and large, the men I like
are mentally unsound.

01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:20.120
- I'd like to know more about you.
- Ask me questions.

01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:24.520
One swallow doesn't make...?

01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:26.560
A swallow?

01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:29.560
A summer.

01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:30.920
And clothes...?

01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:32.440
The man.

01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:33.840
- A good cat deserves...?
- A rat.

01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:35.480
- Patience...?
- Is a virtue.

01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:37.040
- Rolling stone...?
- Gathers no moss.

01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:39.320
- It's a sin...?
- To steal a pin.

01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:41.280
Absence makes...?

01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:42.720
The heart grow fonder.

01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:44.680
- Not bad.
- You collect them?

01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:48.880
In my family, we say a man
who knows his proverbs can't be all bad.

01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:56.600
Pretty girl from the 5th floor, listen to this!

01:43:56.640 --> 01:43:59.480
- Do you believe in miracles?
- Not today.

01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:02.920
You're in for a surprise.

01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:06.160
What if I told you that a team of climbers

01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:10.000
on Mont Blanc had found

01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:14.480
hard proof that my husband loved me?

01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:48.520
Lucien, I need some yeast.

01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:52.320
For Miss Amélie?
She's baking her famous plum cake?

01:44:52.360 --> 01:44:55.200
Collignon! Go and get the yeast.

01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:48.720
Amélie?

01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:49.760
Amélie?

01:45:56.800 --> 01:45:57.800
Amélie?

01:46:18.760 --> 01:46:19.760
[I'll be back]

01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:52.440
Go into the bedroom, Miss Poulain.

01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:10.840
So, little Amélie,

01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:14.800
your bones aren't made of glass.

01:47:14.840 --> 01:47:17.840
You can take life's knocks.

01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:22.080
If you let this chance go by,

01:47:22.120 --> 01:47:28.520
eventually your heart will become

01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:34.360
as dry and brittle as my skeleton.

01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:37.400
So...

01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:40.480
Go and get him, for pete's sake!

01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:26.720
[Without you, today's emotions
would be the scurf of yesterday's]

01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:22.360
International airport.

01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:27.240
September 28th 1997. It is exactly 11am.

01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:29.880
At the funfair, near the ghost train,

01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:32.960
the marshmallow twister is twisting.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.200
Meanwhile, on a bench in Villette Square,

01:51:35.240 --> 01:51:40.480
Félix Lerbier learns there are more links
in his brain than atoms in the universe.

01:51:41.520 --> 01:51:42.600
Meanwhile,

01:51:42.640 --> 01:51:46.160
at the Sacré Cœur,
the nuns are practicing their backhand.

01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:48.520
The temperature is 24°C,

01:51:48.560 --> 01:51:50.360
humidity 70%,

01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:53.520
atmospheric pressure 999 millibars.
