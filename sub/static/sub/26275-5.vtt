WEBVTT

00:09.919 --> 00:11.721
-Morning. What are you...?
-Shh, shh, shh.

00:11.754 --> 00:14.223
It's so quiet you can hear
the bacon sizzling. Listen.

00:14.257 --> 00:15.692
What? What?

00:15.725 --> 00:17.193
No, no.

00:17.226 --> 00:18.895
(laughing):
I would never crumble you up

00:18.928 --> 00:21.030
and put you into a salad.

00:22.399 --> 00:25.335
Oh, bacon talks to me, baby.

00:25.368 --> 00:26.736
You know what?
I feel I've walked in

00:26.769 --> 00:28.405
on something-- I can leave.

00:28.438 --> 00:32.074
No, no, no. Stick around.
Enjoy the peace and quiet.

00:32.108 --> 00:34.243
This house has never been
this empty.

00:34.277 --> 00:36.346
Face it, I think we've made
too many people.

00:36.379 --> 00:40.517
Kyle and Mandy are hardly
ever around.

00:40.550 --> 00:42.652
Sometimes I just think
it's too quiet.

00:42.685 --> 00:44.186
Nah, it's not too quiet.

00:44.220 --> 00:45.422
Tonight, I'm making fajitas.

00:45.455 --> 00:48.024
They tend to get pretty chatty.

00:48.057 --> 00:50.192
No, we have the NSE fundraiser
tonight, remember?

00:50.226 --> 00:51.728
The annual meet and greet

00:51.761 --> 00:53.830
with the, uh,
foreign exchange students.

00:53.863 --> 00:55.732
Are they still doing that?

00:55.765 --> 00:57.734
With all that talk of
a travel ban and a big wall,

00:57.767 --> 00:59.436
you'd think
they'd just stay out.

00:59.469 --> 01:02.104
Oh, come on. Come on.

01:02.138 --> 01:04.240
You know how important
the NSE is to me.

01:04.273 --> 01:06.208
That semester I spent
in Rio De Janeiro,

01:06.242 --> 01:07.644
it changed my life.

01:07.677 --> 01:09.646
-I know.
The people, the culture.
-Mmm.

01:09.679 --> 01:11.581
That big statue of Jesus
you thought

01:11.614 --> 01:13.316
was watching you the whole time.

01:13.350 --> 01:17.086
Hey, those eyes followed me
everywhere I went.

01:17.119 --> 01:19.789
And if it wasn't Jesus,
I'd say it was creepy.

01:22.124 --> 01:24.126
And my host family
was so nice.

01:24.160 --> 01:25.628
They kind of had to be,
didn't they?

01:25.662 --> 01:26.929
-Mm.
-Yeah.

01:26.963 --> 01:30.132
A natural blonde family
in Brazil.

01:30.166 --> 01:32.735
(coughs) Escaped Nazis.

01:32.769 --> 01:34.437
Oh, stop it.

01:34.471 --> 01:36.506
You know what? Fine. Fine.
I will go by myself,

01:36.539 --> 01:38.307
but I am taking the checkbook.

01:38.341 --> 01:40.643
It knows how to talk, too.

01:40.677 --> 01:43.245
In fact, I'm gonna make it sing.

01:43.279 --> 01:45.982
Just remember, when you're
signing those checks,

01:46.015 --> 01:49.352
Jesus is watching.

01:49.386 --> 01:52.822
And he doesn't like show-offs.

01:52.855 --> 01:54.857
*

02:00.697 --> 02:01.964
Hi, there.

02:01.998 --> 02:03.500
I'm, uh, I'm Vanessa.

02:03.533 --> 02:07.136
A little old for high school,
aren't you?

02:08.805 --> 02:11.307
-I'm Jen.
-Oh, uh...

02:11.340 --> 02:13.843
Well, it's-it's nice
to meet you.

02:13.876 --> 02:16.112
And, uh, where are-are you from?

02:16.145 --> 02:19.682
Hong Kong. I was accepted into
the program for next semester,

02:19.716 --> 02:22.351
so my father and I are here
meeting families.

02:22.385 --> 02:25.321
Well, I did my semester in Rio,
which, uh,

02:25.354 --> 02:27.957
I chose mostly because of
the Duran Duran song.

02:27.990 --> 02:31.193
I only wanted to study
in Colorado.

02:31.227 --> 02:34.564
I have a poster of Pikes Peak
in my bedroom.

02:34.597 --> 02:35.865
Oh, not Justin Bieber?

02:35.898 --> 02:38.668
Yuk, please.
Is he made of pink granite?

02:38.701 --> 02:39.802
Oh.

02:39.836 --> 02:41.504
I want to be a geologist.

02:41.538 --> 02:43.840
Wh...? (laughs)

02:43.873 --> 02:48.244
Uh... I'm-- I-I'm a geologist.

02:48.277 --> 02:50.312
That is so cool.

02:50.346 --> 02:51.814
I want to get a degree
in earth sciences

02:51.848 --> 02:52.982
so I could teach someday.

02:53.015 --> 02:56.318
I taught science.

02:56.352 --> 02:58.788
Um, so-so I guess you want

02:58.821 --> 03:01.624
to do something
for the "crater" good?

03:03.125 --> 03:04.694
It's a joke. 'Cause...

03:04.727 --> 03:07.029
-A good one.
-Good?

03:07.063 --> 03:09.566
I love geology puns.

03:09.599 --> 03:12.368
(laughs) My "sediments" exactly.

03:12.401 --> 03:15.905
(laughs) I never take them
for "granite."

03:15.938 --> 03:17.273
(both laugh)

03:18.941 --> 03:20.843
You guys better get going.

03:20.877 --> 03:22.645
-Boyd's practice ends at 8:00.
-Yeah.

03:22.679 --> 03:24.013
Thank you guys for picking
him up this week.

03:24.046 --> 03:25.515
I mean, Kris has been
pulling doubles

03:25.548 --> 03:27.016
and I'm swamped at
the dispensary.

03:27.049 --> 03:28.585
Oh, yeah. How is the...

03:28.618 --> 03:31.854
(whispering):
...marijuana business?

03:31.888 --> 03:34.056
(whispering):
Legal.

03:34.090 --> 03:36.325
You don't have to whisper.

03:36.358 --> 03:38.895
(whispering):
I like to whisper.

03:38.928 --> 03:42.364
It's the only reason
I watch golf.

03:42.398 --> 03:45.334
I can't wait for Boyd's update
on Danielle.

03:45.367 --> 03:48.070
I remember the first crush
a boy had on me.

03:48.104 --> 03:51.373
I like to think
he never married.

03:51.407 --> 03:53.442
Uh, Boyd has a crush
on somebody?

03:53.476 --> 03:55.878
Oh, Danielle?
In his math class?

03:55.912 --> 03:58.080
Smells like cherries?

03:58.114 --> 03:59.749
You guys didn't know about this?

03:59.782 --> 04:01.518
I'm sure Boyd's been meaning
to tell you.

04:01.551 --> 04:05.121
Oh, yeah, I mean, he tells us,
like, so much stuff, so...

04:05.154 --> 04:07.356
Oh, did he tell you about
that fight that Paul

04:07.389 --> 04:09.425
and Chris got into 'cause they
had the same backpacks?

04:09.458 --> 04:12.428
(laughing) That was so funny.

04:12.461 --> 04:14.430
Chris broke Paul's nose.

04:14.463 --> 04:16.799
No, that's the part we agreed
was not funny.

04:22.371 --> 04:23.840
-Well?
-Oh, hey.

04:23.873 --> 04:26.042
How was the fundraiser?
Are we broke?

04:26.075 --> 04:28.410
(laughs)

04:28.444 --> 04:30.647
It was magical,
and you'll be happy to know

04:30.680 --> 04:32.314
I didn't give them any money.

04:32.348 --> 04:34.416
Good so far.

04:34.450 --> 04:37.053
Because what they really need

04:37.086 --> 04:40.122
are places for
the exchange students to stay.

04:42.659 --> 04:46.195
And you just jumped off a cliff.

04:46.228 --> 04:50.132
Honey, I met this really sweet
girl from Hong Kong named Jen.

04:50.166 --> 04:51.934
She is absolutely amazing.

04:51.968 --> 04:53.435
We had so much in common.

04:53.469 --> 04:55.304
What, uh, she's married
to a wonderful man

04:55.337 --> 04:57.073
who likes his life
just the way it is?

04:57.106 --> 04:58.775
Honey...

04:58.808 --> 05:01.443
what-what if we
were to offer Jen

05:01.477 --> 05:03.312
a place to stay next semester?

05:03.345 --> 05:04.614
Let's think about that.

05:04.647 --> 05:07.483
Nope.

05:07.516 --> 05:09.552
A student from another country
needs a home

05:09.586 --> 05:11.287
and your response is "nope"?

05:11.320 --> 05:13.522
Yep.

05:13.556 --> 05:15.091
Honey, c-- it's just
for a semester.

05:15.124 --> 05:16.793
We are this close to having
the house by ourselves.

05:16.826 --> 05:17.860
You want to ruin that?

05:17.894 --> 05:19.629
You've been really busy at work

05:19.662 --> 05:22.131
and-and-and it might be nice to
have somebody else around here.

05:22.164 --> 05:24.333
You know, I mean, not everybody
can talk to bacon.

05:24.366 --> 05:26.235
All right, look at it this way.
We got four bathrooms.

05:26.268 --> 05:28.504
That's two a piece. You could
have the crapper down here

05:28.537 --> 05:31.273
-just for your decorative soaps.
-Oh, come on.

05:31.307 --> 05:33.309
All I'm asking is
to have dinner with Jen

05:33.342 --> 05:35.111
and her dad so we can meet them.

05:35.144 --> 05:37.546
I'm just not that interested
in this.

05:37.580 --> 05:40.349
All right, well, uh,
I hear what you're saying...

05:40.382 --> 05:43.052
-and I understand your concerns.
-Good, good. Excellent.

05:43.085 --> 05:45.087
But no.

05:49.759 --> 05:53.696
What... What do you mean "no"?

05:53.730 --> 05:57.566
I want this,
so I am overruling you.

05:59.268 --> 06:01.370
You can do that?

06:02.772 --> 06:04.540
I can, I can.

06:04.573 --> 06:06.643
I am going to invite Jen
and her dad here

06:06.676 --> 06:08.277
for dinner tomorrow night.

06:08.310 --> 06:11.447
And you will be sweet
and nonconfrontational.

06:11.480 --> 06:15.184
And-and you won't bring up
things like "snowflake"

06:15.217 --> 06:17.720
or "Benghazi"

06:17.754 --> 06:20.556
or "Deflategate."

06:23.592 --> 06:26.696
They're all connected.

06:32.401 --> 06:34.637
-Mikey, join, come on,
have a drink. Come on.
-Yeah, come on.

06:34.671 --> 06:36.438
You know, Ed, when you said
you were gonna retire,

06:36.472 --> 06:39.375
I-I thought you were gonna do
this at home.

06:39.408 --> 06:42.078
What can I tell you?
I missed my friends. Come on.

06:42.111 --> 06:44.113
You've been gone two days.

06:45.247 --> 06:48.117
Hey, join some real men
for drinks, okay?

06:48.150 --> 06:50.787
Ed's making fuzzy navels.

06:50.820 --> 06:53.222
Yeah, nothing says
"real men drinking"

06:53.255 --> 06:57.293
like peach schnapps
and an orange wedge.

06:57.326 --> 06:58.995
Listen, I'm heading home.

06:59.028 --> 07:00.763
I'm gonna do a meet and greet
with Vanessa

07:00.797 --> 07:02.699
and a foreign exchange student.

07:02.732 --> 07:04.300
(laughing) Oh, oh,
this is priceless.

07:04.333 --> 07:07.904
Mike Baxter is hosting
a foreign exchange student.

07:07.937 --> 07:10.606
No, no, no, no, no. Vanessa
invited them to come meet us.

07:10.639 --> 07:13.575
And I'm married to Vanessa.

07:13.609 --> 07:15.978
Translation, translation,
when Vanessa says "jump,"

07:16.012 --> 07:17.814
Mike says "how high?"

07:17.847 --> 07:20.216
(laughs) You know, Joe,
I'm gonna let that go by,

07:20.249 --> 07:22.318
because I know you're
three peaches to the wind.

07:24.386 --> 07:25.955
When any of my wives
wanted to do something

07:25.988 --> 07:28.157
that I was against,
I said "No, no, no, no, no."

07:28.190 --> 07:30.092
-Did you really?
-Yep.

07:30.126 --> 07:32.628
That's why you're in the
Divorce Attorney's Hall of Fame.

07:32.661 --> 07:34.596
I make sacrifices for my wife,
okay?

07:34.630 --> 07:36.165
And if that means sitting
quietly at dinner

07:36.198 --> 07:37.666
with this girl
and her father,

07:37.700 --> 07:39.635
then that's
what I'm going to do.

07:39.668 --> 07:41.170
You mean you have to make
a good impression on them?

07:41.203 --> 07:43.005
-Yes, yes.
-Okay, your worries are over.

07:43.039 --> 07:45.474
What is that supposed to mean?

07:45.507 --> 07:46.876
Oh-oh, it means you

07:46.909 --> 07:50.479
have never had the pleasure
of meeting you.

07:50.512 --> 07:54.550
At tonight's dinner I'm gonna be
pleasant and nonconfrontational.

07:54.583 --> 07:57.153
It wouldn't matter,
it's in the eyes...

07:57.186 --> 07:59.889
the opinion, the anger,

07:59.922 --> 08:03.292
the howling emptiness.

08:03.325 --> 08:05.361
You know, Joe,
don't take this personally,

08:05.394 --> 08:07.663
but I-I don't like you.

08:07.696 --> 08:09.866
See, there's the Mike Baxter
we know,

08:09.899 --> 08:11.500
and the only Mike Baxter
you can be.

08:11.533 --> 08:13.002
Look, I'm gonna enjoy
a nice, quiet evening

08:13.035 --> 08:14.570
at my home with my wife
and her guests.

08:14.603 --> 08:18.107
You guys enjoy your
sorority mixer, huh?

08:18.140 --> 08:21.310
Joke's on him. I'm gonna go puke
in his office.

08:25.481 --> 08:27.884
Why didn't you tell us about
your little friend Danielle?

08:27.917 --> 08:29.852
There's nothing to tell.

08:29.886 --> 08:33.655
I think when someone smells like
cherries it's newsworthy.

08:33.689 --> 08:37.526
You know, honey, I'd love to
hear about what you're up to.

08:37.559 --> 08:40.797
And not just from Kyle
and Mandy.

08:40.830 --> 08:44.533
When I tell them stuff, they
don't make a big deal about it.

08:44.566 --> 08:47.369
I won't make a big deal.
I promise.

08:47.403 --> 08:50.106
Okay.

08:50.139 --> 08:52.541
Uh, she's coming over tomorrow
to do homework.

08:52.574 --> 08:55.211
(gasps) That is so cute!
(laughs)

08:55.244 --> 08:57.013
I mean, not cute.

08:57.046 --> 08:59.381
I mean super normal.

08:59.415 --> 09:02.684
Please, Mom, don't embarrass me.

09:02.718 --> 09:04.053
And no pictures.

09:04.086 --> 09:05.687
Deal.

09:05.721 --> 09:07.389
Can I take one now, though?

09:07.423 --> 09:10.192
'Cause this is kind of a really
special moment for me.

09:10.226 --> 09:12.194
(sighs) Fine.

09:12.228 --> 09:14.230
(squeals)

09:20.469 --> 09:22.271
-That's what I'm talking about.
-Hey, hey, hey, hey.

09:22.304 --> 09:24.740
Those mixed nuts
are for our guests.

09:24.773 --> 09:27.076
I had one cashew.

09:27.109 --> 09:30.379
A cashew? Honey, I'm trying
to make a good impression here.

09:30.412 --> 09:32.614
J-- Eat the hazelnuts.

09:32.648 --> 09:36.752
Nobody eats the hazelnuts, why
do they even put 'em in there?

09:36.785 --> 09:38.720
-(doorbell rings)
-Oh, that's them.

09:38.754 --> 09:40.923
Uh, listen, honey, uh, remember:
be nice.

09:40.957 --> 09:44.293
I don't need to be reminded
to be... All right.

09:46.495 --> 09:48.330
Hey, welcome.

09:48.364 --> 09:49.966
-Hi. Come on in.
-Hello. Thank you. Thank you.

09:49.999 --> 09:53.903
Mr. Zhen, uh, I'm Mike Baxter.
Ni hao, Huanyíng.

09:55.604 --> 09:57.573
Please, call me Henry.

09:57.606 --> 09:59.175
-Cantonese and Mandarin.
-Yeah.

09:59.208 --> 10:01.143
-That's very good.
-Thank you.

10:01.177 --> 10:02.945
Well, Mike knows how to say
"hello," "good-bye"

10:02.979 --> 10:05.247
and "where's the bathroom"
in several languages.

10:06.482 --> 10:08.650
Your wife says
you also talk to bacon.

10:11.753 --> 10:14.123
That's 'cause bacon
can keep a secret.

10:16.625 --> 10:18.895
-Come on in, guys.
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

10:18.928 --> 10:21.597
So, um, Henry, this is
your first time to Colorado?

10:21.630 --> 10:25.101
Uh, yes, uh,
but I'm a civil engineer,

10:25.134 --> 10:27.403
so I often visit other cities...

10:27.436 --> 10:30.506
-Uh-huh.
-to, uh... Ooh.

10:35.811 --> 10:38.814
Uh, to study infrastructure,
you know, bridges, roads.

10:38.847 --> 10:40.149
Well, you'll learn a lot
here in Denver.

10:40.182 --> 10:43.285
We invented road rage
and the pothole.

10:43.319 --> 10:44.954
Forgive me for saying so,

10:44.987 --> 10:47.023
but I can't understand
how such a wealthy country

10:47.056 --> 10:49.625
has such poorly
maintained roads.

10:49.658 --> 10:50.826
I'll tell you why,
because we have

10:50.859 --> 10:52.761
-a government just full of...
-Nuh-nuh, nuh-nuh.

10:56.465 --> 10:59.701
Our government is full
of dedicated men and women

10:59.735 --> 11:01.203
doing their best, God bless 'em.

11:02.871 --> 11:05.107
Well said. You get a cashew.

11:05.141 --> 11:07.209
No, thanks. I prefer hazelnuts.

11:07.243 --> 11:09.545
Uh, I'm gonna go
check on dinner.

11:09.578 --> 11:11.880
-Jen, you want
to give me a hand?
-Yes.

11:11.914 --> 11:13.182
Daddy?

11:13.215 --> 11:15.051
(speaking Cantonese)

11:18.754 --> 11:20.856
She told me
not to embarrass her.

11:20.889 --> 11:22.558
(laughs):
I don't know those words,

11:22.591 --> 11:24.326
but I've heard that music.

11:24.360 --> 11:27.063
So... so, uh,
I don't know if you know,

11:27.096 --> 11:29.065
but I own
a large outdoor equipment

11:29.098 --> 11:31.000
and sporting goods store
here in town.

11:31.033 --> 11:32.734
-Yes, Outdoor Man.
I've heard this.
-Yes.

11:32.768 --> 11:34.003
Excellent.
If you have some time, stop by

11:34.036 --> 11:35.204
and I'll show you the facility.

11:35.237 --> 11:36.973
Oh, I'd be honored.

11:37.006 --> 11:39.808
Has your president's trade war
affected your business?

11:44.213 --> 11:47.216
I read that because
of his aluminum tariffs,

11:47.249 --> 11:49.051
boat prices have gone up.

11:50.086 --> 11:52.188
Hmm.

11:52.221 --> 11:54.723
Well, the important thing
about boats

11:54.756 --> 11:58.127
is that th-they're able
to float.

12:00.196 --> 12:01.763
Speaking of your president...

12:01.797 --> 12:03.799
(groans)

12:05.734 --> 12:07.869
...it's hard for people
outside of the United States

12:07.903 --> 12:10.072
to understand
how he beat Mrs. Clinton

12:10.106 --> 12:11.473
in your last election.

12:11.507 --> 12:14.210
(mouths)

12:14.243 --> 12:17.213
She had more experience, right?

12:17.246 --> 12:20.182
Uh, people say that.

12:20.216 --> 12:22.418
And more votes, too?

12:22.451 --> 12:24.453
Wh... Ow.

12:26.822 --> 12:29.825
I literally
have just bitten my tongue.

12:31.927 --> 12:34.696
H-How's it going
in there, honey?

12:36.165 --> 12:39.335
-VANESSA: Three minutes!
-Okay.

12:39.368 --> 12:41.537
You know, why don't we see
how the women are doing?

12:41.570 --> 12:43.372
Gladly.

12:43.405 --> 12:44.806
Oh, but before we eat...

12:44.840 --> 12:46.475
(speaking Cantonese)

12:46.508 --> 12:47.976
Right. Right in there,

12:48.010 --> 12:49.778
and there's matches
right by the toilet.

12:57.286 --> 12:59.921
I think Jen would fit right in
at Woodbridge High.

12:59.955 --> 13:01.657
All three of our girls
went there.

13:01.690 --> 13:03.092
There's a geology club, Dad.

13:03.125 --> 13:04.860
Mrs. Baxter said
I would love it.

13:04.893 --> 13:06.262
Oh, no. No, no, no.

13:06.295 --> 13:09.131
-I said you would "lava" it.
-(laughs)

13:09.165 --> 13:12.601
(laughs) I'm, uh, kind of famous
for my wordplay.

13:12.634 --> 13:14.670
(laughs)

13:14.703 --> 13:17.073
(phone dings)

13:17.106 --> 13:19.975
Oh, I'm so sorry,
but our ride is here.

13:20.008 --> 13:22.511
-We have to go, Jen.
-But I want to help clean up.

13:22.544 --> 13:23.979
Oh, no, no, we've got it.

13:24.012 --> 13:25.814
That's very sweet
of you, though. Thanks.

13:25.847 --> 13:28.884
-That was so much fun, Vanessa.
-Oh. (chuckles)

13:28.917 --> 13:30.519
Nice to meet you, Mr. Baxter.

13:30.552 --> 13:32.521
-It was a pleasure to meet you.
-(chuckles)

13:34.523 --> 13:37.193
Again, thank you for making
my daughter feel so welcome.

13:37.226 --> 13:38.494
She's a wonderful little girl.

13:38.527 --> 13:40.096
And, uh, if you have
any questions

13:40.129 --> 13:41.330
while you're making
your decision,

13:41.363 --> 13:42.898
please feel free to call.

13:42.931 --> 13:44.633
-I've already made my decision.
-MIKE: Ah.

13:44.666 --> 13:46.402
Jen will not be staying here.

13:46.435 --> 13:48.270
I'm sorry. Good night.

13:54.310 --> 13:56.945
He must have already
made up his mind.

13:56.978 --> 14:00.015
You know, that has to be it,
because I think we were great.

14:00.048 --> 14:01.217
Honey, we've been over this,
all right?

14:01.250 --> 14:02.651
You didn't do anything wrong.

14:02.684 --> 14:04.320
I didn't do anything wrong.

14:04.353 --> 14:06.988
We-- I in particular--
didn't do anything wrong.

14:07.022 --> 14:09.425
I know I'm a broken record,
but I just...

14:09.458 --> 14:11.493
I can't let it go.
I really liked that girl.

14:11.527 --> 14:13.529
Well, truth be told,

14:13.562 --> 14:15.364
-I liked her, too.
-Yeah.

14:15.397 --> 14:17.999
If it means that much to you,

14:18.033 --> 14:20.336
maybe we should try
to get another exchange student.

14:20.369 --> 14:22.238
No, I don't want
a different student.

14:22.271 --> 14:23.972
Oh, thank God.

14:24.005 --> 14:27.876
I just feel like I had
a real connection with her.

14:27.909 --> 14:31.380
And not just because of the puns
and the geology.

14:31.413 --> 14:33.249
I know it's crazy, but...

14:33.282 --> 14:35.384
I just feel
like this girl needs me.

14:35.417 --> 14:38.520
Like-like I could make
a real difference in her life.

14:38.554 --> 14:42.658
-You just can't stop
being a mother, can you?
-No.

14:42.691 --> 14:45.161
I don't want to.

14:45.194 --> 14:48.230
(sighs) But thanks to her dad,

14:48.264 --> 14:50.266
I guess I don't have a choice.

14:52.234 --> 14:54.203
RYAN:
Can you believe this?

14:54.236 --> 14:56.905
Our little boy
is having a girl over.

14:56.938 --> 14:58.340
The next thing you know,
we are gonna be doing

14:58.374 --> 15:00.075
the father-son dance
at his wedding.

15:00.108 --> 15:01.610
Ryan, stop, okay?

15:01.643 --> 15:03.179
We are not allowed to be excited
about this.

15:03.212 --> 15:04.913
He's growing up,

15:04.946 --> 15:06.882
-and we need to start
treating him like it.
-I know.

15:06.915 --> 15:08.083
-I know.
-Hmm.

15:08.116 --> 15:09.451
But it is so cool, right?

15:09.485 --> 15:11.620
It's the coolest thing
that's ever happened!

15:11.653 --> 15:13.522
(laughs)

15:13.555 --> 15:16.358
-Okay.
-Okay.

15:16.392 --> 15:18.227
-Hey.
-Hey.

15:18.260 --> 15:20.762
Yay, you're both here.

15:20.796 --> 15:21.963
Don't worry, Boyd.

15:21.997 --> 15:23.599
Your dad and I
are gonna give you your space

15:23.632 --> 15:25.301
-while you do your homework
with Danielle.
-Yeah.

15:25.334 --> 15:28.069
(laughs): We're gonna be chill.
Super chill.

15:28.103 --> 15:30.739
-(phone chimes)
-Okay, she's almost here.

15:30.772 --> 15:34.410
Remember, no one
is going to embarrass me.

15:34.443 --> 15:35.944
Of course not.

15:35.977 --> 15:38.113
And I would ask you this
even if you were an adult:

15:38.146 --> 15:41.417
-are you sure you don't want
any juice or apple slices?
-Mom!

15:41.450 --> 15:44.653
-Okay, okay. I'm sorry.
We'll butt out.
-Come on.

15:45.687 --> 15:48.557
-Hang on.
-What's wrong?

15:48.590 --> 15:50.559
It's just my hands
are kind of sweaty.

15:50.592 --> 15:52.127
It's hard to swallow.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.463
Boyd, take a deep breath,
okay? Relax.

15:54.496 --> 15:57.199
-Remember, this is no big deal.
-Yeah, honey.

15:57.233 --> 16:00.502
You're not a little boy anymore.
You're growing up.

16:00.536 --> 16:02.170
We know you can handle this.

16:02.204 --> 16:04.606
You think so?

16:04.640 --> 16:06.141
I know so.

16:07.643 --> 16:09.611
Okay. I got this.

16:09.645 --> 16:11.647
RYAN:
Come on.

16:16.485 --> 16:19.655
She changed clothes.
Why would she do that?

16:21.156 --> 16:23.859
Stall her.
I have to gel my hair.

16:25.994 --> 16:29.365
Oh, look at that.
He's still our little boy.

16:29.398 --> 16:31.300
Yeah, I was recording
that whole thing.

16:31.333 --> 16:33.302
Yes.

16:33.335 --> 16:36.004
HENRY:
I must say,

16:36.037 --> 16:37.706
Mike, I was surprised
you were still willing

16:37.739 --> 16:39.475
to give me a tour
of Outdoor Man.

16:39.508 --> 16:40.776
Well, a promise is a promise.

16:40.809 --> 16:42.678
Why won't you let Jen stay
with us?

16:42.711 --> 16:44.613
(sighs)

16:44.646 --> 16:46.848
-This is why I'm here.
-Is it...

16:46.882 --> 16:48.384
is it my wife, Vanessa?

16:48.417 --> 16:50.552
Or the-- or the bad puns?

16:50.586 --> 16:53.188
Hazelnuts.

16:53.221 --> 16:55.891
-No, Vanessa is delightful.
-Yeah?

16:55.924 --> 16:58.894
Frankly, I said no
because of you.

16:59.928 --> 17:02.264
I w-was nothing but polite.

17:02.298 --> 17:03.899
Exactly.

17:03.932 --> 17:07.269
You strike me as weak
and afraid of confrontation.

17:11.373 --> 17:13.241
And you also seem
to have no opinions

17:13.275 --> 17:14.510
on how your country is run.

17:14.543 --> 17:16.612
Oh, no!

17:16.645 --> 17:19.581
Whoa! Hey, hey, Chuck?

17:19.615 --> 17:21.583
-Are you out there?
Could you step in here a minute?
-Ah.

17:21.617 --> 17:23.985
This is Chuck Larabee,
the head of our security.

17:24.019 --> 17:25.521
-Mr. Zhen.
-Oh, oh.

17:25.554 --> 17:26.855
Your daughter's
the foreign exchange student.

17:26.888 --> 17:28.256
-Yes.
-Yeah. Hey.

17:28.290 --> 17:30.926
(stammers)
Describe Mike Baxter to him.

17:30.959 --> 17:32.628
(sighs)

17:32.661 --> 17:36.264
-Mike Baxter is a lovely man.
-No.

17:38.066 --> 17:40.769
No, no, the real...
the real Mike Baxter.

17:40.802 --> 17:43.405
Oh, okay. He's warm and gentle.

17:43.439 --> 17:45.273
Come on. Ed, Ed,
hold on a second.

17:45.307 --> 17:47.108
Ed Alzate. He's the owner,

17:47.142 --> 17:48.544
-actually, of the store here.
-Okay.

17:48.577 --> 17:50.245
-Mr. Zhen, this is Ed Alzate.
-Yes. Yes.

17:50.278 --> 17:52.213
Oh, how do you do, sir?
Yes. Pleasure, yeah.

17:52.247 --> 17:53.949
-He says I'm easygoing.
-Mm-hmm.

17:53.982 --> 17:55.751
-Okay?
-Well, it's true.

17:55.784 --> 17:59.621
I haven't heard him
raise his voice in 30 years.

18:01.256 --> 18:03.725
Hey, hey, hey.
I need the real truth here.

18:03.759 --> 18:05.494
Vanessa's gonna lose
the exchange student

18:05.527 --> 18:08.564
'cause this guy
thinks I'm a pushover.

18:09.598 --> 18:11.066
Oh.

18:11.099 --> 18:13.635
Okay. (clears throat)

18:13.669 --> 18:15.637
Okay.

18:15.671 --> 18:17.639
He's a real bastard.

18:19.575 --> 18:21.810
Loud, pushy, mean.

18:21.843 --> 18:23.479
Beats you to death
with his opinions.

18:23.512 --> 18:25.781
Constantly. All the time.
With everyone.

18:25.814 --> 18:27.749
Yeah. (stammers)
And he's cheap, too.

18:27.783 --> 18:28.917
-Yeah.
-That's right.

18:28.950 --> 18:29.985
-He charges for coffee...
-Yeah.

18:30.018 --> 18:31.953
Okay, all right.
We get the idea.

18:31.987 --> 18:33.489
Thanks guys, thanks.
It's good.

18:33.522 --> 18:35.424
ED:
He doesn't pay overtime, either.

18:35.457 --> 18:37.258
Look, the other night,
I was just being polite.

18:37.292 --> 18:38.394
I have opinions
about everything.

18:38.427 --> 18:41.997
Our roads suck because
our government sucks!

18:42.030 --> 18:44.800
Mike Baxter.

18:46.835 --> 18:48.770
Okay, clearly you are not weak.

18:48.804 --> 18:51.840
Thank you.
So can Jen stay with us?

18:51.873 --> 18:54.109
No. You're too rigid.

18:55.711 --> 18:58.380
Too rigid, too weak.
What are you trying to do here?

18:58.414 --> 19:00.949
(stammers) I don't have
to give you a reason why

19:00.982 --> 19:03.785
I-I want my daughter home.

19:03.819 --> 19:07.923
You... You don't have
a problem with me.

19:07.956 --> 19:10.125
You don't want her
to be away from you.

19:10.158 --> 19:13.328
(sighs)

19:13.361 --> 19:16.197
Yes.

19:16.231 --> 19:17.899
(groans)

19:19.735 --> 19:21.803
I'm the weak one.

19:21.837 --> 19:25.306
No, you're not.
You're just being a dad.

19:25.340 --> 19:27.576
Kid wants to leave home,
it's a drag.

19:27.609 --> 19:30.145
Believe me, I know.

19:30.178 --> 19:33.549
You know, Jen lost her mother
when she was ten.

19:33.582 --> 19:37.218
It's just been
the two of us, and...

19:37.252 --> 19:41.289
I'm afraid for her to be
so far away from me.

19:41.322 --> 19:46.394
I-I know I want what's best for
her, but I... I have doubts.

19:46.428 --> 19:48.263
I've spent, actually,
a lot of time in China,

19:48.296 --> 19:50.799
and there was a proverb I once
heard that meant a lot to me.

19:50.832 --> 19:53.702
It said, "Deep doubts,
deep wisdom."

19:53.735 --> 19:56.772
And you wouldn't be a good dad
if you didn't have deep doubts.

19:58.373 --> 20:01.209
I just think it's our job
to let our kids

20:01.242 --> 20:02.911
follow their own dreams.

20:02.944 --> 20:06.014
(chuckles) I know this
in my head, but...

20:06.047 --> 20:08.083
If you want her to experience
a good mother,

20:08.116 --> 20:10.552
there's no better mother
than my wife Vanessa.

20:12.387 --> 20:16.625
You, sir, are a terrible,
horrible, angry dictator!

20:20.261 --> 20:23.599
I think it would be good for Jen
to stay with you.

20:23.632 --> 20:27.268
See that? I did it! I did it!
(yells)

20:34.610 --> 20:37.078
So, so one tectonic plate says
to the other one,

20:37.112 --> 20:39.380
-"I'm sorry, that was..."
-BOTH: "My fault."

20:39.414 --> 20:41.082
(laughing)

20:41.116 --> 20:44.586
Hey, guys. So...

20:44.620 --> 20:46.454
one last meal
before you head home?

20:46.488 --> 20:48.724
I am so glad you'll be
staying with us.

20:48.757 --> 20:51.126
Yes, my father and I will be
flying home tomorrow,

20:51.159 --> 20:53.461
but I can't wait
for next semester.

20:53.495 --> 20:55.597
Good, good, good. You know,
just to let you know that

20:55.631 --> 20:58.233
that really wasn't me
last night, I...

20:58.266 --> 21:00.869
I have a lot more attitude.

21:00.902 --> 21:04.139
Well, just to let you know,

21:04.172 --> 21:08.109
that wasn't the real me
last night, either.

21:08.143 --> 21:11.813
You know, there's an
American expression I love:

21:11.847 --> 21:13.348
"A man's home is his castle."

21:13.381 --> 21:16.417
I prefer an ancient
Chinese expression:

21:16.451 --> 21:18.353
"Man does not control
his own fate;

21:18.386 --> 21:22.257
the women in his life
do it for him."

21:23.424 --> 21:24.860
Good-bye, peaceful kitchen.

21:24.893 --> 21:28.830
Hello, hellscape of bad puns
and estrogen.

21:30.532 --> 21:33.635
So I guess you put the "Jen"
into estroJen.

21:33.669 --> 21:35.003
(laughing)

21:35.036 --> 21:38.039
And so it begins.

21:41.509 --> 21:43.511
