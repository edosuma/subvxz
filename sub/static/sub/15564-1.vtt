"...to move out
and leave Staten Island forever."

02:19.320 --> 02:21.766
<i>Good morning, what you doin'?</i>

02:21.840 --> 02:24.127
<i>Besides stalking JP of course?</i>

02:24.200 --> 02:26.441
I'm reading the news,
thank you very much.

02:26.520 --> 02:30.650
<i>Oh, you're reading the
news, you're such a good liar.</i>

02:30.720 --> 02:33.644
Seriously, how do you
know I'm stalking JP?

02:33.720 --> 02:35.609
<i>Because I know
you very very well.</i>

02:35.680 --> 02:37.842
<i>Oh, wait, did you tell your
mom about CalArts yet?</i>

02:37.920 --> 02:41.402
Yeah, I told her. She's super excited
for me to move across the country

02:41.480 --> 02:43.130
and go to a really
expensive art school.

02:43.200 --> 02:44.611
<i>Really?</i>

02:44.680 --> 02:46.250
- No.
<i>- No?</i>

02:46.320 --> 02:49.290
No, I haven't found, I haven't found
the right time to tell her.

02:49.360 --> 02:51.647
<i>Oh, Nerve is starting.</i>

02:51.720 --> 02:53.290
<i>Sorry, this is really important.</i>

02:53.400 --> 02:55.482
- What's Nerve?
<i>- It's a game.</i>

02:55.560 --> 02:58.086
<i>Here, just click on the video.</i>

03:00.680 --> 03:03.047
<i>Welcome to Nerve New York City.</i>

03:03.160 --> 03:07.085
<i>Nerve is a 24-hour game,
like Truth or Dare, minus the Truth.</i>

03:07.160 --> 03:11.609
<i>Watchers pay to watch.
Players play to win, cash and glory.</i>

03:11.680 --> 03:15.162
<i>Are you a watcher or a player?
Are you a watcher or a player?</i>

03:15.680 --> 03:18.081
<i>Are you a watcher or a player?</i>

03:18.280 --> 03:19.520
<i>It's cool, right?</i>

03:19.600 --> 03:22.888
This looks very sketchy.
Is this legal?

03:22.960 --> 03:24.849
<i>I don't know, probably not.</i>

03:24.920 --> 03:26.696
<i>Just do it, just sign up and watch,
time's ticking.</i>

03:26.720 --> 03:27.767
Okay, signing up.

03:27.840 --> 03:29.968
Look, this is me
signing up to watch you.

03:30.040 --> 03:31.929
<i>Vee, you have to
sign up and watch me.</i>

03:32.000 --> 03:33.650
<i>It's very important
that I have Watchers.</i>

03:33.720 --> 03:35.136
- Hey!
- I gotta go. My mom just got home.

03:35.160 --> 03:36.696
<i>- Just do it.</i>
- I'll sign up after breakfast,

03:36.720 --> 03:37.976
- I promise.
<i>- Thank you, I love you,</i>

03:38.000 --> 03:39.764
<i>- I'll see you in a little bit.</i>
- Bye.

03:39.840 --> 03:41.285
<i>Bye.</i>

03:45.680 --> 03:47.808
I mean Syd hasn't gotten
into any schools yet.

03:47.880 --> 03:49.211
And she doesn't even care.

03:49.280 --> 03:52.568
You know what, Sydney doesn't
have to care, she has a trust fund.

03:52.640 --> 03:54.881
And you have something far
more valuable than that.

03:54.960 --> 03:55.961
Here we go.

03:56.040 --> 03:58.407
You have drive, you have focus.

03:58.480 --> 04:01.051
You have a scholarship
to a local college.

04:01.120 --> 04:02.804
And even though we
can't afford the dorm,

04:02.880 --> 04:07.602
you get to have me
as your new college roommate.

04:07.680 --> 04:12.561
Actually, I, um... I have
kind of a cool idea about that.

04:13.240 --> 04:18.690
What if we fixed up Mike's room
and listed you on Airbnb or something.

04:18.760 --> 04:23.243
Maybe it's time we finally
go through his stuff

04:23.320 --> 04:25.243
and maybe give some of it to Goodwill.

04:25.320 --> 04:28.688
- And I could give you some space.
- I don't want space.

04:30.360 --> 04:32.124
I just want you.

04:33.680 --> 04:37.765
Okay.
I'm totally down with commuting.

04:37.880 --> 04:40.121
I can get my reading
done on the ferry.

04:40.200 --> 04:41.201
Yeah?

04:42.440 --> 04:43.805
That'll work, right?

04:43.880 --> 04:45.484
Yeah.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.765
Let's say, "Go Cougars"
on the count of one, two three!

05:35.840 --> 05:37.968
Go Cougars!

05:38.040 --> 05:40.771
Let's go, Cougars!

05:40.840 --> 05:44.481
Let's go, Cougars!
Let's go, Cougars!

05:44.560 --> 05:46.528
- Hand me the zoom lens.
- Here.

05:46.600 --> 05:47.816
Doesn't it feel a little unbalanced

05:47.840 --> 05:50.684
if every single yearbook
photo is of JP Guerrero?

05:50.760 --> 05:52.967
It's not my fault he's on the team.

05:53.080 --> 05:54.844
- Alright, boys, here we go!
- Here.

05:56.360 --> 05:59.045
Alright, careful, careful.

06:00.520 --> 06:02.045
Let's hit it, JP!

06:02.120 --> 06:05.169
Alright, let's go, let's go!
Come on!

06:05.240 --> 06:09.689
Watch out, watch out, watch out!
Yeah, you got it. Alright, be careful!

06:25.320 --> 06:27.721
Let's go, Cougars!

06:30.240 --> 06:32.527
Let's go, Cougars!

06:33.040 --> 06:35.168
Let's go, Cougars!

06:35.920 --> 06:37.445
Liv, Liv!

06:38.640 --> 06:40.722
Let's show them
what we got, Cougars!

06:42.760 --> 06:45.001
Okay, let's play foot...
Where you goin', Syd?

06:45.080 --> 06:46.650
Okay, we lost our cheerleader.

06:46.760 --> 06:50.082
Alright, let's show
'em what we got VHS!

06:50.160 --> 06:51.456
Are you ready,
remember what to do?

06:51.480 --> 06:52.641
Okay.

06:52.720 --> 06:55.007
- Okay, you're on!
- Hey, watchers!

06:55.080 --> 06:58.163
<i>It's Syd Baby. I'm counting on you
to get me to the final round.</i>

06:58.240 --> 07:01.642
<i>So don't let me down
and I won't let you down, I promise.</i>

07:03.520 --> 07:05.841
Let's go, VHS!

07:08.000 --> 07:10.480
Go, dude, show 'em what we got!

07:10.560 --> 07:13.040
Show 'em what
Staten Island's really about!

07:14.480 --> 07:15.811
Go cheer, baby!

07:30.520 --> 07:32.727
Ooh, how
'bout that ass, though?

07:32.800 --> 07:34.802
Okay, thank you, Sydney.

07:39.160 --> 07:40.241
Whoo!

07:48.720 --> 07:52.008
<i>Ahh, you guys dared
me to eat dog food.</i>

07:52.080 --> 07:53.776
<i>You can do this,
just don't think about it.</i>

07:53.800 --> 07:55.882
<i>Ohh, this is so
gross, this is so gross.</i>

07:55.960 --> 07:59.282
<i>Okay, keep it in.</i>

08:07.920 --> 08:09.490
<i>Wassup, Watchers?</i>

08:11.920 --> 08:13.888
<i>Ssh!</i>

08:17.120 --> 08:19.771
<i>Ooh, money money.</i>

08:19.840 --> 08:22.366
<i>- I have so many Watchers now.
- Yeah, you do, girl!</i>

08:22.480 --> 08:24.960
<i>I just need to get in that little
box thing. Who's winning now?</i>

08:25.000 --> 08:28.049
Apparently, this guy named Ryan.

08:28.120 --> 08:31.010
I guess he put peanut butter on his junk
and let his dog lick it off.

08:31.080 --> 08:32.445
- What?
- I could do that.

08:32.520 --> 08:34.203
But you don't have a dog.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.806
- I could still do it.
- Or a dick, Liv.

08:36.880 --> 08:38.609
They're coming
up with your next dare!

08:38.679 --> 08:41.285
What is it? I need something flashy
like the peanut butter thing.

08:41.360 --> 08:43.601
Hey.

08:43.679 --> 08:44.920
Oh, my God, how weird.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.456
How do they know you're
afraid of heights?

08:46.480 --> 08:48.642
- What?
- That's what they do, it's easy.

08:48.720 --> 08:50.616
They just take all your
info from your old profiles

08:50.640 --> 08:51.856
and put it in your Nerve profile.

08:51.880 --> 08:54.565
- That's so creepy.
- You just got suspended.

08:54.640 --> 08:57.120
- I thought you were done playing Nerve.
- Hell no!

08:57.200 --> 08:59.771
The girl who won Seattle now
has millions of followers.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.002
- She is insta-famous.
- Who cares?

09:02.080 --> 09:05.971
I care, Vee.
I don't expect you to understand.

09:06.040 --> 09:07.690
I'm an adrenaline junkie.

09:07.760 --> 09:10.240
You like to stay within your
comfort zone, that's fine.

09:10.360 --> 09:13.011
That's not true. What about
that pole dancing class we took?

09:13.080 --> 09:15.924
Vee, I dragged you there
and you sat in the corner and watched.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.651
- I'm a visual learner.
- Why are you attacking her?

09:18.720 --> 09:20.768
- I'm not attacking her, Tommy.
- Yeah, you are.

09:20.840 --> 09:21.921
Life is passing you by.

09:22.040 --> 09:24.646
You need to learn to take a few
risks every once in a while.

09:24.720 --> 09:27.166
- I do take risks.
- Really?

09:27.240 --> 09:32.280
Okay, fine. Let's just say,
hypothetically, you're playing Nerve.

09:32.360 --> 09:33.805
What'd be a good
Nerve dare for Vee?

09:33.880 --> 09:35.882
Make out with JP.

09:35.960 --> 09:38.930
Baby steps, baby steps.
Just talk to JP.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.126
What?

09:40.200 --> 09:41.486
He probably likes you, too.

09:41.600 --> 09:43.376
You'll just never know
if you don't talk to him.

09:43.400 --> 09:45.896
And then everybody that's watching you
they would just go on and vote.

09:45.920 --> 09:48.969
Who wants to see
Vee mackin' on JP?

09:49.040 --> 09:50.849
- Oh, my God!
- You guys!

09:50.920 --> 09:53.127
All who wanna see
Vee macking on JP say "Yes."

09:53.200 --> 09:54.929
Yes!

09:55.000 --> 09:56.081
Yes, yes.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.810
- I assume, "No"?
- Abstain.

09:57.880 --> 10:02.010
- Thank you.
- Alright, you've been dared.

10:02.120 --> 10:04.088
Do you accept your dare, Vee?

10:04.160 --> 10:06.367
Say, "Yes."
Say, "Yes."

10:06.440 --> 10:08.044
What's the point?
We're graduating, I...

10:08.120 --> 10:11.283
- All you have to do is say, "Hi."
- I don't want to say "Hello" to him.

10:11.360 --> 10:16.287
Fine. I love you so much, Vee,
but you're a Watcher.

10:16.360 --> 10:17.600
So watch me do it for you.

10:17.720 --> 10:19.290
- No no no, Syd, Syd, Syd.
- Just watch.

10:19.360 --> 10:21.044
No, no, no, Syd, no.

10:22.480 --> 10:23.811
Yeah, Sydney!

10:23.880 --> 10:25.848
Why don't you show us
the front next time?

10:25.920 --> 10:29.083
You first, Chuck.
I hear it's really big.

10:30.480 --> 10:32.050
Guess it's average.

10:32.120 --> 10:35.203
- Hey, JP.
- What's up?

10:35.320 --> 10:39.325
I was wondering, do you
have a girlfriend right now?

10:39.400 --> 10:40.401
No!

10:41.800 --> 10:43.962
It's not for me, it's for a friend.

10:45.320 --> 10:47.084
Well, which friend?

10:59.200 --> 11:01.043
No, she's not my type.

11:03.200 --> 11:05.202
You're not nearly
as hot as you think you are.

11:05.280 --> 11:07.520
- Yes, he is!
- And you are a douchebag.

11:08.720 --> 11:10.927
No, don't go, come on.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.081
Vee, Vee!

11:12.160 --> 11:16.484
Just let her go.
Not cool, Sydney.

11:16.560 --> 11:18.210
I'm just trying to help her.

11:18.320 --> 11:21.005
- Let's not help her.
- She'll figure it out.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.651
<i>Hello, welcome to Nerve.</i>

12:28.720 --> 12:31.007
<i>You have chosen Player.</i>

12:31.080 --> 12:32.684
<i>Nerve is a direct democracy.</i>

12:32.760 --> 12:34.808
<i>Watchers decide your dares.</i>

12:34.880 --> 12:36.689
<i>The two Players with
the most Watchers</i>

12:36.760 --> 12:39.889
<i>by the end of regulation
will advance to the final round</i>

12:39.960 --> 12:41.530
<i>where the winner takes all.</i>

12:41.600 --> 12:45.207
<i>Watchers can watch from anywhere
but they are encouraged to film live.</i>

12:45.280 --> 12:48.443
<i>So don't be alarmed.
There are three rules:</i>

12:48.520 --> 12:51.524
<i>One, all dares must be
filmed on the Player's phone.</i>

12:51.600 --> 12:54.046
<i>Two, there are only two
ways to be eliminated.</i>

12:54.120 --> 12:56.168
<i>Fail or bail.</i>

12:56.400 --> 12:58.528
<i>Three, snitches get stitches.</i>

12:58.600 --> 13:02.491
<i>Thank you for keeping Nerve a secret.
Good luck, Player.</i>

13:30.040 --> 13:31.456
<i>Hey, it's Vee, I'm not here right now...</i>

13:31.480 --> 13:34.245
<i>Vee, you have
to sign up and watch me.</i>

13:38.040 --> 13:40.725
<i>...for account information, press one.</i>

13:40.840 --> 13:43.207
<i>For phone or credit card information...</i>

13:47.560 --> 13:49.216
- Tommy.
<i>- Hey, I'm pulling up outside.</i>

13:49.240 --> 13:50.280
<i>What the hell's so urgent?</i>

13:50.320 --> 13:51.976
We have to go to Colonnade Diner,
we have 15 minutes.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.206
<i>Why, what's going on?</i>

13:53.280 --> 13:55.487
I signed up for Nerve
and that's where my first dare is.

13:55.560 --> 13:59.645
What do you mean,
you signed up as a Player?

13:59.720 --> 14:01.085
Oh, man.

14:01.160 --> 14:03.128
What, is that so hard to believe?

14:07.240 --> 14:10.323
You know that some kid supposedly
died in Seattle playing Nerve?

14:10.400 --> 14:14.166
I don't buy that. If kids were dying,
the game would be shut down.

14:14.240 --> 14:17.164
No, they can't shut it down.
There's not a single server.

14:17.240 --> 14:18.401
What does that mean?

14:18.480 --> 14:21.609
Everybody that logs onto
the game becomes a new server.

14:21.680 --> 14:23.887
So it's impossible
to turn the game off.

14:23.960 --> 14:25.536
How do you even know
so much about this game?

14:25.560 --> 14:26.561
You've never even played.

14:26.640 --> 14:28.802
Look, I spend a lot of time
on the dark web, alright?

14:28.880 --> 14:30.211
Oh a lot of time on the dark web?

14:30.280 --> 14:32.282
- Is that right, hacker boy?
- Yes, that is right.

14:32.360 --> 14:36.445
You're only accessing ten percent
of the Internet, you know.

14:36.560 --> 14:38.324
Why are you even doing this?

14:38.400 --> 14:40.402
Seriously, it's dangerous.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.084
Is it because of Sydney?

14:42.160 --> 14:44.606
This is not about Sydney. I'm...

14:44.680 --> 14:46.762
It's just not like you.

14:47.960 --> 14:49.564
That's the point.

14:52.360 --> 14:54.488
<i>Kiss a stranger for five seconds?</i>

14:54.560 --> 14:58.326
<i>A stranger, Vee,
I'll give you 100 dollars.</i>

15:06.040 --> 15:07.087
Okay, Okay.

15:07.160 --> 15:08.969
You're just gonna
kiss some random person?

15:13.840 --> 15:15.683
He has a girlfriend.

15:31.920 --> 15:33.684
Just kiss that guy.

15:36.000 --> 15:41.131
- Okay, I'm gonna kiss that guy.
- Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

15:41.200 --> 15:42.929
Gonna do it.

15:45.400 --> 15:47.243
Or that guy, he reads.

15:49.440 --> 15:51.522
Well, make a choice, clock's ticking.

15:51.600 --> 15:53.250
- Hi.
- Hey.

15:54.520 --> 15:55.885
I'm kissing that guy.

15:55.960 --> 15:59.362
Okay, you sit here,
tell me when you're rolling, okay?

15:59.440 --> 16:01.886
Okay, it's Mission Impossible now?

16:01.960 --> 16:03.246
Just go.

16:17.680 --> 16:21.571
To... <i>To the Lighthouse,</i>
that's my favorite book.

16:21.640 --> 16:22.721
Really?

16:26.240 --> 16:28.481
Please, tell me they get to
the lighthouse in the end.

16:29.800 --> 16:31.643
Um...

16:31.760 --> 16:33.762
Actually, don't tell me.

16:33.840 --> 16:35.524
Okay, just tell me real quick.

16:35.640 --> 16:39.565
Yeah, they do, but that's,
that's not really what it's about.

16:39.640 --> 16:41.976
The lighthouse means something
different to each of the characters.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.129
It basically represents the
thing they want most in life.

16:45.200 --> 16:48.761
And I'm sorry that I'm totally
geeking out and ruining the story.

16:48.840 --> 16:51.320
No, I was the one who asked.

17:02.040 --> 17:03.976
One Mississippi,
two Mississippi, three Mississippi,

17:04.000 --> 17:06.765
four Mississippi, five Mississippi.
Done.

17:06.839 --> 17:09.844
Done.Done.

17:12.280 --> 17:14.281
- Okay.
- Okay, bye.

17:16.520 --> 17:18.409
Oh, my God, I can't
believe I just did that!

17:18.480 --> 17:21.131
- Gosh, why am I embarrassed?
- Did you get it?

17:21.200 --> 17:24.807
Yeah, it was a miniseries,
I got all six episodes.

17:26.240 --> 17:29.084
- Where did he go?
- I have no clue.

17:33.560 --> 17:36.040
"Vee, $100 has been
wired to your account."

17:36.120 --> 17:38.600
- Should I check?
- You should totally check.

17:40.400 --> 17:46.328
<i>♪ Every time I look

18:38.120 --> 18:39.724
- Thank you.
- Good job.

18:39.800 --> 18:42.451
You won your dare, congratulations.

18:42.520 --> 18:43.601
Back at ya.

18:43.680 --> 18:48.402
Mine was totally embarrassing,
but at least I got 100 bucks, right?

18:48.520 --> 18:50.682
I'm sorry, I promise
I didn't know what was comin'.

18:50.760 --> 18:52.364
- Do you mind?
- Sorry, I'm sitting here.

18:52.440 --> 18:55.091
They just told me to
sit in that booth and... Sorry.

18:55.160 --> 18:57.242
Some kid came by
and gave me that book.

18:57.320 --> 18:59.482
<i>To the Lighthouse,</i> yeah, my favorite.

18:59.560 --> 19:01.562
Exactly because it's
on your Facebook page.

19:01.640 --> 19:04.564
They know all the
information about you, Vee.

19:04.640 --> 19:06.608
Your name's Vee?

19:06.680 --> 19:09.763
- Short for Venus.
- I like that.

19:09.840 --> 19:13.322
Her parents, they named her
after the Goddess of Love.

19:13.400 --> 19:15.164
There's a Roman myth.

19:17.320 --> 19:20.881
Yeah, I guess my mom was
expecting somebody else.

19:20.960 --> 19:24.169
I dunno about that.
That was some kiss.

19:25.320 --> 19:28.324
I got a game to play
but good night to you guys.

19:28.400 --> 19:29.811
Thank you.

19:36.680 --> 19:37.681
What?

19:39.920 --> 19:43.402
Apparently the Watchers
like us together.

19:43.480 --> 19:45.244
I mean, you can't even
go to the city, right?

19:45.320 --> 19:46.970
You know, I can't go to the city, yeah.

19:47.080 --> 19:50.129
I'm not even playing,
I was just doing one dare.

19:50.200 --> 19:54.285
- Are you sure? It's 200 bucks.
- She's pretty sure, man.

19:57.160 --> 20:00.004
He always tell you what to do?

20:00.080 --> 20:02.242
No, no, he doesn't.

20:06.600 --> 20:09.285
I'm gonna be outside
if you change your mind.

20:09.360 --> 20:10.850
It's nice to meet you, Vee.

20:12.200 --> 20:13.565
See ya, man.

20:15.320 --> 20:18.722
He thought that
those were our fries.

20:22.400 --> 20:26.041
- I could use 200 bucks.
- Vee, you're not going to the city.

20:26.160 --> 20:27.650
You said one dare.

20:31.800 --> 20:32.801
I'm sorry.

20:34.560 --> 20:38.281
You know what,
Charles Manson was a singer.

20:47.120 --> 20:49.282
I was hoping you'd come.

20:52.400 --> 20:56.121
I'm just warning you, I don't think
I'd make a very good partner.

20:56.200 --> 20:59.170
I'm not the daredevil type.

21:00.200 --> 21:01.936
You should team up with
my friend Sydney actually.

21:01.960 --> 21:04.042
She's obsessed
with playing Nerve.

21:05.640 --> 21:09.611
But the Watchers want
me to team up with you.

21:28.080 --> 21:30.731
The second I feel
uncomfortable, I'm out.

21:30.800 --> 21:31.961
That's fair.

21:42.080 --> 21:43.206
Okay.

21:56.320 --> 21:57.446
Hold on.

22:54.560 --> 22:56.722
<i>I just have to go to the bathroom.</i>

23:07.280 --> 23:09.248
<i>Excuse me, ladies?</i>

23:09.320 --> 23:10.321
Ladies?

23:11.520 --> 23:14.649
<i>Hey, where are you going?
Please, let me fart on you, please!</i>

23:14.720 --> 23:18.566
- Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!
- Oh, my God.

23:18.640 --> 23:20.563
- It's going up so fast!
- I know.

23:20.640 --> 23:22.802
Who's your favorite Player?

23:22.920 --> 23:29.280
Well, I mean, I was gonna
say you, but now I don't know.

23:29.360 --> 23:30.361
Is that Vee?

23:30.440 --> 23:33.489
Yeah, she's playing and she
has, like, a lot of Watchers.

23:33.560 --> 23:35.244
Oh, my God, girl!

23:44.160 --> 23:47.243
- Hey, try screaming.
- No.

23:47.360 --> 23:48.771
You can do it, let it out!

23:51.680 --> 23:52.761
There you go.

24:05.440 --> 24:07.124
Alright, this is it.

24:08.960 --> 24:11.247
Am I supposed to come in with you?

24:13.360 --> 24:15.727
Doesn't say anything about that.

24:17.080 --> 24:19.686
Well, thank you for the lift.

24:21.560 --> 24:23.244
You gonna be okay?

24:23.320 --> 24:25.891
Yeah, yeah, no, I'm tired,

24:25.960 --> 24:28.645
so I'm probably just gonna
make my way back home.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.561
Um... This is fun.

24:33.640 --> 24:36.041
- Yeah.
- I just gotta... you know.

24:36.160 --> 24:37.241
Okay.

24:55.360 --> 24:56.930
You got three more steps.

24:57.000 --> 25:01.164
If you keep up the exercises,
you're gonna get really strong on that.

25:01.240 --> 25:02.810
Excellent.

25:03.400 --> 25:04.686
Thanks, Miss.

25:07.200 --> 25:09.806
Somebody's sending Vee money.

25:09.880 --> 25:11.882
White people problems.

25:13.360 --> 25:15.010
What is she doing?

25:27.640 --> 25:31.042
And you have your receipt. So thank you
so much for shopping at Bergdorf's.

25:31.120 --> 25:34.124
- You have a wonderful day.
- Excuse me, sorry.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.089
Do you know where
I can find this dress?

25:36.160 --> 25:38.401
Your mom's calling.

25:39.800 --> 25:40.926
Shit!

25:43.640 --> 25:45.642
That's very expensive.

25:47.360 --> 25:49.442
- Couture, fourth floor.
- Thanks.

26:35.280 --> 26:38.011
Please, don't undress the mannequin.

26:38.080 --> 26:41.846
- Sorry.
- Would you like to try this on?

26:41.920 --> 26:43.206
Mm-hm.

26:44.840 --> 26:47.047
Let me see
if I have it in your size.

26:47.120 --> 26:48.167
Thank you.

26:48.240 --> 26:51.210
If you could hurry up,
I'm a little bit late for a party.

26:51.280 --> 26:52.520
Cute.

26:52.600 --> 26:54.523
Okay, right this way.

26:56.320 --> 26:57.736
If you need anything else,
just let me know.

26:57.760 --> 27:00.604
- Okay, thank you.
- Oh, alright.

27:33.080 --> 27:35.367
Okay, dressed.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.081
Hello?

27:42.760 --> 27:46.287
- Everything okay?
- Everything is great, thank you.

28:08.560 --> 28:11.291
Hey, what's your email number?

28:11.360 --> 28:14.489
I mean your... What's your info?

28:15.360 --> 28:16.850
Oh, this, this old thing?

28:16.920 --> 28:19.127
- Vee!
- Oh!

28:20.680 --> 28:21.727
Hey.

28:21.800 --> 28:23.370
Hi.

28:23.440 --> 28:25.568
You look very pretty.

28:25.680 --> 28:27.284
Thanks, so do you.

28:27.360 --> 28:29.886
I mean you look, you know,
hot, or handsome or...

28:33.360 --> 28:35.488
Do you know what we're
supposed to do now?

28:35.560 --> 28:41.886
The Watchers would like me
to complete your ensemble, mademoiselle.

28:51.280 --> 28:53.806
<i>Neither, is that an option?</i>

28:56.920 --> 29:00.322
Alright, how 'bout my
firstborn son, too?

29:14.960 --> 29:16.246
What are you doing, Vee?

29:16.320 --> 29:20.325
<i>- How much are they, sir?
- That'll be $900, madam.</i>

29:20.400 --> 29:22.607
<i>In that case I'll take two.</i>

29:22.680 --> 29:25.365
<i>One for the city
and one for the Hamptons.</i>

29:25.480 --> 29:29.121
Excellent choice, mademoiselle.

29:29.200 --> 29:32.283
I'll wrap them up
for you right away.

29:45.280 --> 29:46.805
I'll see ya downstairs?

29:46.880 --> 29:49.042
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay, alright.

29:53.960 --> 29:55.121
What?

30:07.720 --> 30:10.041
Excuse me, Miss, did you
move my clothes in there?

30:10.160 --> 30:11.491
Of course not.

30:18.320 --> 30:22.006
This is not happening.

30:24.840 --> 30:27.571
Vee? Vee?

30:27.640 --> 30:29.290
- Ian.
- Hey.

30:30.520 --> 30:31.646
Did you take my stuff?

30:31.720 --> 30:33.536
I mean, my wallet,
my clothes, everything's gone.

30:33.560 --> 30:35.449
No, my stuff is gone, too.

30:40.240 --> 30:42.811
- No.
- Okay...

30:42.880 --> 30:44.656
- No, no.
- Come on, we have to make a run for it.

30:44.680 --> 30:46.444
- Come on, let's go.
- I am not shoplifting!

30:46.520 --> 30:49.364
We don't have a choice, come on!

30:52.800 --> 30:56.521
Okay, technically, it just says
we have to leave the store.

30:59.080 --> 31:00.161
Right?

31:35.720 --> 31:36.881
Let's go.

31:44.080 --> 31:46.367
Come on, come on, let's go!

31:51.000 --> 31:52.684
Mmm...

32:00.400 --> 32:01.845
Um...

32:11.800 --> 32:14.371
Sorry, buddy, we need
to come through, sorry.

32:17.840 --> 32:19.604
Excuse me, excuse me!

32:33.920 --> 32:36.366
Let's go, come on, come on.

32:36.440 --> 32:39.125
Whoa, whoa, hey, stop, stop, stop!

32:40.440 --> 32:42.568
Please, tell me
these are our clothes!

32:43.360 --> 32:47.365
- They kind of are.
- Are these stolen?

32:48.760 --> 32:49.966
Receipt.

32:50.040 --> 32:52.805
<i>- We get to keep 'em?
- All yours.</i>

32:54.600 --> 32:57.046
Hey, can I get the check?

32:57.160 --> 32:58.889
Who paid for these?

33:01.640 --> 33:05.486
Probably, one of the Watchers
with daddy's credit card.

33:07.400 --> 33:09.164
- What?
- Look!

33:12.000 --> 33:14.321
<i>♪ Dolla dolla bill, y'all!</i>

33:14.400 --> 33:16.562
I'm sorry, was that
a Wu-Tang reference?

33:16.680 --> 33:18.967
- Staten Island, represent!
- Okay.

33:23.080 --> 33:25.162
Saint Mark's, ten minutes?

33:39.600 --> 33:40.647
Hello.

33:40.720 --> 33:42.336
Tommy, what
does Vee think she's doing?

33:42.360 --> 33:43.856
Have you ever
parked a car in your life?

33:43.880 --> 33:46.201
I got this, girl.

33:46.280 --> 33:47.566
<i>I have no idea, Syd.</i>

33:47.640 --> 33:49.529
Why are you asking me,
I'm not her boyfriend.

33:49.600 --> 33:51.576
<i>Well, who's this
biker she's teamed up with?</i>

33:51.600 --> 33:54.046
<i>I have no clue,
she just ditched me.</i>

33:54.120 --> 33:56.726
She's doing what she apparently
thinks is best for herself.

33:56.800 --> 33:58.245
Yeah, and what exactly is that?

33:58.320 --> 34:02.166
Sydney, Syd, Vee is in the top 10.

34:02.240 --> 34:04.402
- What?
- She's in the top 10.

34:04.520 --> 34:06.045
Tommy, Vee is in the top 10?

34:06.120 --> 34:07.816
- Yeah, I know.
- <i>How is that even possible?</i>

34:07.840 --> 34:12.164
- How many Watchers does she have?
- Like 4,471.

34:12.400 --> 34:16.724
- How many do I have?
- 6,806.

34:16.800 --> 34:19.326
Oh, okay, I have a lot more.

34:19.520 --> 34:22.091
<i>Tommy, I really don't think
that Vee can handle this.</i>

34:22.159 --> 34:24.639
<i>- I'm actually really worried about her.</i>
- Yeah, me too.

34:24.719 --> 34:27.041
<i>So get your ass to
this party and help me, okay?</i>

34:27.120 --> 34:29.407
Yeah, yeah, I'm on my way.

35:06.160 --> 35:07.685
What happens if I bail?

35:07.760 --> 35:10.445
You lose everything
you've already made.

35:10.520 --> 35:12.443
My mom would kill me.

35:14.400 --> 35:16.050
What do you want to do?

35:47.160 --> 35:50.369
Okay, just please no
fire breathing dragons or knives,

35:50.440 --> 35:53.808
no clowns, no snakes, no skeletons.

35:53.920 --> 35:56.685
What about panthers and tornadoes?

35:56.800 --> 35:58.962
- No. No.
- No? Okay.

35:59.040 --> 36:02.965
Whoa, what about this?
Just a tattoo of my dad.

36:03.040 --> 36:05.850
He's gorgeous, honestly,
he's a nice looking guy.

36:05.920 --> 36:09.561
Okay, I got a better idea, here we go.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.809
- You're gonna draw it, no!
- Shh!

36:11.880 --> 36:14.850
Be quiet, I gotta concentrate.
Back off.

36:16.880 --> 36:17.961
Okay.

36:19.600 --> 36:21.489
Can you do something like
this but less shitty?

36:21.560 --> 36:24.086
- Yes!
- Yeah?

36:24.200 --> 36:26.123
Right, I'm laughing
'cause it's good.

36:26.200 --> 36:27.565
You guys, come on.

36:27.640 --> 36:30.041
You have to trust us,
that's the whole thing.

36:30.120 --> 36:31.326
Gotta trust me.

36:31.400 --> 36:33.448
And dirt beard.

36:34.240 --> 36:35.890
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

36:37.560 --> 36:39.210
<i>Okay, you can stop.</i>

36:42.320 --> 36:44.163
<i>You can stop,
I think we're good, we're good.</i>

36:44.240 --> 36:46.296
<i>The dare said it just had
to be bigger than a quarter.</i>

36:46.320 --> 36:48.721
<i>This definitely feels
bigger than a quarter.</i>

36:48.800 --> 36:50.529
You're doing great, it's almost done.

36:50.600 --> 36:52.640
Okay, no, I think wherever
we're at it, we can stop.

36:52.680 --> 36:53.681
<i>Ow...</i>

36:53.760 --> 36:56.286
Hold on, I'm just
doing the "Y" in daddy.

36:56.440 --> 36:59.922
- What?
- He's kidding, don't listen to him.

37:02.640 --> 37:06.201
I really don't like that noise at all.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.126
Ow...

37:17.200 --> 37:18.884
Oh, my God.

37:30.760 --> 37:32.330
Ow...

37:38.680 --> 37:42.162
- Rocking that gold tooth.
- I forget the rest.

37:42.280 --> 37:45.045
Okay, okay. Ow!

37:46.800 --> 37:48.723
Wu-Tang fan, huh?

37:48.800 --> 37:50.536
My brother used to listen
to them all the time.

37:50.560 --> 37:52.642
Oh, yeah, you have a brother?

37:52.720 --> 37:54.245
I had a brother.

37:55.400 --> 37:57.641
He died right before
starting college.

37:57.720 --> 37:59.210
I'm sorry.

37:59.280 --> 38:01.044
How long ago was that?

38:01.120 --> 38:04.602
Two years ago, he was 18.

38:05.600 --> 38:08.683
This July, I'll be older than him.

38:08.760 --> 38:11.411
Older than my older brother.
Ow, ow, ow. ow...

38:11.480 --> 38:15.280
Hey, hey, come on.
Stay with me, stay with me.

38:16.560 --> 38:19.564
He was just one of those people
that wasn't afraid of anything.

38:19.640 --> 38:21.881
He always said yes.

38:21.960 --> 38:26.284
He would laugh so hard if he saw me
getting a tattoo right now.

38:26.880 --> 38:31.169
Boom, I'm done! Go to that mirror
and you celebrate my work.

38:31.240 --> 38:32.896
- Come on, let's go.
- Do I want to see it?

38:32.920 --> 38:34.365
Yes, yes, yes.

38:34.840 --> 38:36.569
- Hey.
<i>- What's up, young Jedi?</i>

38:36.640 --> 38:39.166
- Yeah, hi, hey.
- We miss you down here at the club.

38:39.240 --> 38:42.244
- You're watching Nerve, right?
<i>- Yeah, man, we all are.</i>

38:42.320 --> 38:44.971
Alright, I'm trying to find
out more about this Ian guy.

38:45.040 --> 38:48.283
Ian, my dude, he playing with your
little girlfriend, Vee, right?

38:48.360 --> 38:49.656
Could be you but you ain't playing.

38:49.680 --> 38:51.240
Alright, yes, that's the problem though

38:51.280 --> 38:54.682
but I'm looking on his profile
and there's just nothing on the guy.

38:54.760 --> 38:58.810
- Well, did you try Google?
- Yeah, I tried Google.

38:58.880 --> 39:01.247
I guess he's a ghost then.

39:01.320 --> 39:04.244
Look, I need to take it to Aruba.

39:06.840 --> 39:09.491
- Ah, what, no.
<i>- Yes, come on.</i>

39:09.560 --> 39:11.336
<i>No way, you're
not ready for that shit.</i>

39:11.360 --> 39:12.616
- Yes, I know.
<i>- You're gonna mess up my rating.</i>

39:12.640 --> 39:13.736
I'm not gonna mess up your rating.

39:13.760 --> 39:15.489
I'm not gonna buy
guns or something, man.

39:15.560 --> 39:17.324
<i>Tommy no, not happening.</i>

39:17.400 --> 39:21.246
Look, I'm just worried
about my friend, please.

39:21.320 --> 39:24.210
- Come on.
- Alright, I'll send you a pass key.

39:24.280 --> 39:26.567
Alright, thank you.

39:29.120 --> 39:32.522
A lighthouse?
I love it, thank you.

39:34.280 --> 39:39.491
Well, a very wise person once said,
and this was earlier today,

39:40.440 --> 39:44.490
they said that the lighthouse represents
the thing that you want the most.

39:44.560 --> 39:48.167
So, whatever that is,
I hope you get it.

39:51.120 --> 39:54.567
<i>How many followers
does she have now?</i>

39:54.640 --> 39:57.883
I mean, to be fair,
you did tell her to take a risk.

39:57.960 --> 40:00.281
This isn't what I meant, Liv.

40:01.720 --> 40:03.290
This is ridiculous.

40:03.360 --> 40:05.089
Sydney.

40:09.040 --> 40:14.001
<i>Okay, now they're
asking if I can trust you. Can I?</i>

40:14.080 --> 40:16.401
<i>I have the perfect
tattoo picked out for you.</i>

40:16.480 --> 40:18.084
<i>Wait, wait, wait.</i>

40:19.400 --> 40:22.563
<i>- No, okay, it's not a tattoo dare.
- What is it?</i>

40:22.640 --> 40:25.644
<i>Just says go to Park and 25th.</i>

40:47.320 --> 40:50.563
Oh, God, I love the internet.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.331
What?

41:16.160 --> 41:17.446
What?

41:17.520 --> 41:18.567
<i>Ian's played before?</i>

41:18.640 --> 41:20.640
<i>- You don't have to do this.
- I can do this.</i>

41:20.680 --> 41:23.763
<i>- You don't have to do this.
- I can do this.</i>

41:29.600 --> 41:32.251
<i>Hey, it's Vee, I'm not
here right now. So, leave a mess...</i>

41:34.000 --> 41:35.968
Here we go.

41:36.680 --> 41:38.728
Get to 60 miles per hour.

41:39.840 --> 41:42.207
- That's it.
- Okay.

41:42.280 --> 41:43.406
Alright?

41:43.520 --> 41:46.285
Easy one, alright, let's do this.

41:49.040 --> 41:51.042
What did that just say?

41:55.800 --> 41:58.280
Blindfolded?
On the motorcycle.

41:58.360 --> 41:59.646
Yeah?

41:59.720 --> 42:03.486
- You're on your own with that one.
- Wait, I can't do this alone.

42:03.560 --> 42:05.369
Come on, I need you
to help me navigate.

42:05.440 --> 42:08.171
There's no way in hell I'm doing that.

42:09.600 --> 42:12.046
I'm sorry, I'm out.

42:12.120 --> 42:14.691
Thank you for tonight.

42:14.800 --> 42:17.724
I had a lot of fun, got a new dress...

42:18.360 --> 42:20.727
But... I'm good.

42:22.080 --> 42:25.084
Stay, let's see what else happens.

42:30.640 --> 42:32.529
Yo, what's up guys?

42:32.640 --> 42:34.324
Veenus, I love your wardrobe.

42:34.400 --> 42:37.404
Could you hold that for me?
Hold it, hold it up.

42:38.800 --> 42:39.881
Great.

42:41.520 --> 42:44.569
Hey, Ian, see you in the finals.

42:44.960 --> 42:46.769
Who was that guy?

42:46.840 --> 42:49.764
I don't know, just another player.

42:52.680 --> 42:56.844
Vee come on, do this with me.
Please, I need you.

42:59.400 --> 43:01.482
Look, you'd be in control.

43:03.440 --> 43:05.283
Say, yes, just say yes.

43:13.240 --> 43:15.527
<i>You got next?
Who wants to challenge the champ?</i>

43:15.600 --> 43:17.125
<i>Liv.</i>

43:18.320 --> 43:20.322
- No way.
- Hey, Liv, come on.

43:21.920 --> 43:23.285
Sydney.

43:24.920 --> 43:26.524
- Sydney.
- What?

43:26.600 --> 43:29.171
Oh, my God, you're
not gonna believe this.

43:32.320 --> 43:35.449
What? Are you kidding me?

43:47.400 --> 43:50.643
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

44:06.760 --> 44:08.888
Now remember, you're my eyes.

44:12.640 --> 44:16.247
Okay... Green.

44:16.320 --> 44:17.651
Hold on.

44:21.040 --> 44:23.486
- You okay?
- Yeah.

44:23.560 --> 44:25.496
- Just keep your eyes open.
- Okay, okay, okay.

44:25.520 --> 44:27.616
Hey, I know you're scared
but you gotta talk to me, Vee.

44:27.640 --> 44:29.290
Okay, wait, no, no, no.

44:29.360 --> 44:31.931
We got this, Vee.
What's going on, what's going on?

44:32.000 --> 44:34.765
- Are we good, are we good?
- Taxi to the right, right, right.

44:34.840 --> 44:36.680
- You've a sticker on your helmet.
- Thank you.

44:36.720 --> 44:38.643
Okay, you're leaning to the left...

44:40.680 --> 44:44.002
- Are you crazy?
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

44:44.080 --> 44:47.448
Okay, too far left,
right, right, right.

44:50.040 --> 44:52.646
Okay, I think that worked, yeah?
Are we good?

44:52.720 --> 44:55.769
- Actually, yes.
- Okay, keep doing that.

44:55.880 --> 44:56.927
Just lean?

44:57.000 --> 45:00.607
Yeah, lean left or right,
you are in control.

45:00.680 --> 45:01.681
That's good.

45:04.040 --> 45:06.884
No way she's doing this.

45:06.960 --> 45:09.645
- This is good, you're doing great.
- Okay, speed up.

45:09.720 --> 45:10.960
Yes, ma'am.

45:19.400 --> 45:22.165
Okay, 30, we're halfway there.

45:23.480 --> 45:25.960
Okay, the next light is green.

45:27.520 --> 45:31.320
- The next light's green.
- Good, good, I got this.

45:31.400 --> 45:33.528
Okay, next light is...

45:34.240 --> 45:37.005
Come on, stay with me, what's going on?

45:37.080 --> 45:38.491
Next light is green, faster.

45:38.560 --> 45:40.722
No, no, no, no, no.

45:48.560 --> 45:49.686
Green.

45:56.760 --> 45:59.684
- We're doing this Vee.
- Sixty seconds.

45:59.760 --> 46:02.081
- Are we clear now?
- Still clear.

46:02.840 --> 46:04.922
Taxi, taxi.

46:18.760 --> 46:22.003
Take it home, Vee,
take it home, Vee.

46:22.840 --> 46:25.889
- Time check!
- Fifteen seconds!

46:25.960 --> 46:30.329
- Speed.
- Forty-six, 47.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.889
Hey, guys, we love you.

46:32.960 --> 46:35.440
- Love you too.
- Let's go.

46:40.120 --> 46:44.205
Fifty-seven, 58, 59, 60!

46:46.280 --> 46:47.725
We did it!

46:47.800 --> 46:49.723
- Oh, shit!
- Look out!

46:49.800 --> 46:51.928
- Hold on!
- Oh, my God!

46:59.440 --> 47:00.885
Vee's number one.

47:00.960 --> 47:02.849
Oh, my God.

47:06.000 --> 47:07.809
That was the craziest
thing I've ever done!

47:07.880 --> 47:11.851
- You were incredible, I wanna like...
- I can't even believe we did that.

47:16.160 --> 47:18.288
Oh, Vee, get it girl.

47:18.360 --> 47:19.725
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

47:35.520 --> 47:37.284
Are you hungry at all?

47:37.360 --> 47:41.251
- Pizza?
- Pizza, I swear I was gonna say pizza.

47:52.280 --> 47:54.851
<i>Hey, Watchers. Okay, listen.</i>

47:54.920 --> 47:56.888
<i>You and I both know that
I should be in that box,</i>

47:56.960 --> 47:59.281
<i>so please stop
holding back, okay?</i>

47:59.360 --> 48:00.456
<i>You guys don't need to be afraid</i>

48:00.480 --> 48:03.131
<i>because I'm not afraid,
so just give me a real dare.</i>

48:07.960 --> 48:12.409
- What's up, Syd, baby?
- What are you doing here?

48:13.720 --> 48:15.643
You're a good Player.

48:18.280 --> 48:22.444
You've got a lot of Watchers,
I got a lot of Watchers.

48:23.440 --> 48:25.408
Maybe we could team up.

48:28.280 --> 48:30.487
I don't need a partner.

48:30.560 --> 48:33.564
Seems to work for your friend Vee.

48:38.400 --> 48:42.883
- What up, Syd, you alright?
- Yeah, we're just talking.

48:44.720 --> 48:48.884
Yo, Mad Max, why don't
you show yourself out, man?

48:59.840 --> 49:01.126
Call me.

49:06.080 --> 49:07.366
Break down.

49:10.600 --> 49:11.647
Captain.

49:15.400 --> 49:17.050
Party on, man!

49:23.160 --> 49:24.241
Hey, Nancy.

49:24.320 --> 49:27.881
<i>Tommy, listen, I have a quick question.
How would I know if I'm being hacked?</i>

49:27.960 --> 49:29.724
<i>- What do you mean?
- Hacked.</i>

49:29.800 --> 49:33.282
<i>Somebody's been depositing
money into my account under Vee's name.</i>

49:33.360 --> 49:35.408
That doesn't sound like a hack.

49:35.480 --> 49:39.087
Normally, they would take money out,
if they were hacking you.

49:39.160 --> 49:41.891
Thomas, what are you not telling me?

49:41.960 --> 49:45.487
Oh, it must...
It might be Vee got a job.

49:45.560 --> 49:48.564
<i>- What, a job?</i>
- Yeah, that's probably it.

49:48.640 --> 49:51.325
- <i>She did an online poker thing.</i>
- Okay.

49:51.400 --> 49:52.890
<i>And she's really great at it.</i>

49:52.960 --> 49:54.240
- Is it legal?
<i>- Yeah, it's legal</i>

49:54.280 --> 49:57.966
and she's doing great,
as you can tell with the deposits

49:58.040 --> 50:03.809
but anyway, I gotta go, I'm writing
a paper right now on motorcycle safety.

50:03.880 --> 50:05.656
- I'm gonna get going but...
<i>- Well, tell her to call me.</i>

50:05.680 --> 50:07.967
- Bye.
- <i>Bye.</i>

50:11.920 --> 50:13.763
Wanna take a ride?

50:14.040 --> 50:18.011
- Is this a dare?
- Mm-mm. It's a carousel.

50:21.680 --> 50:24.684
So, why are you playing Nerve?

50:24.760 --> 50:27.411
Trying to help out my family.

50:27.480 --> 50:31.644
Some things happened that
I wish turned out differently.

50:34.480 --> 50:35.481
Like what?

50:38.280 --> 50:42.251
This is just kind of
something I need to do, so...

50:45.760 --> 50:48.730
We got some paparazzi. Hide.

50:56.880 --> 50:58.530
What, who is it?

51:01.040 --> 51:04.806
So, that's Sydney.
Are you going to get it?

51:04.880 --> 51:06.848
<i>I don't want to deal with her right now.</i>

51:06.920 --> 51:08.570
Ouch.

51:09.800 --> 51:11.484
What's going on?

51:11.560 --> 51:14.609
She's just been odd
recently, but, whatever,

51:14.680 --> 51:16.682
you don't wanna talk about that.

51:17.360 --> 51:20.967
If you want to talk about it I'm here.
I'm happy to listen.

51:25.400 --> 51:29.200
I'm just tired of being
her sidekick all the time.

51:30.440 --> 51:34.365
That's funny, you don't seem
like anyone's sidekick.

51:35.920 --> 51:37.888
Could I see that picture again?

51:41.440 --> 51:42.680
Sure.

51:45.960 --> 51:49.328
- Wow.
- Yeah, guys go crazy for her.

51:50.320 --> 51:54.484
No, I mean, the picture itself,
it's really good.

51:55.960 --> 52:00.124
- Thanks, I took it.
- Yeah? You have a good eye.

52:00.200 --> 52:03.568
I just, I can't picture you hanging out
with someone like this.

52:03.680 --> 52:04.727
What do you mean?

52:04.800 --> 52:08.691
I don't know,
she looks kind of insecure.

52:08.760 --> 52:12.048
- Is that mean?
- She is, totally insecure.

52:12.120 --> 52:16.967
I mean, she makes it seem like I'm the
one who's insecure but really it's her.

52:17.040 --> 52:19.566
- It's exhausting.
- I'm sure.

52:19.640 --> 52:24.646
<i>She's at this party, most likely drunk,
and needs me to hold her hair back.</i>

52:24.720 --> 52:28.042
<i>I'm just over it.
I mean, so are her parents.</i>

52:28.120 --> 52:32.808
<i>They're constantly out of town, so she
has this revolving door of guys over.</i>

52:32.920 --> 52:34.888
It's sad actually.

52:47.520 --> 52:48.965
Hey, that party.

52:50.320 --> 52:52.482
Should we maybe go check it out?

52:53.160 --> 52:57.245
What?
Why would I want to go to that party?

52:57.360 --> 53:00.170
Maybe... show off your new tattoo?

53:01.600 --> 53:05.764
Show Sydney that you're not
the person she thinks you are?

53:53.240 --> 53:54.526
Hey, watch out.

54:06.760 --> 54:11.368
Okay, okay, I got this, okay.

54:14.160 --> 54:15.207
Go, Sydney.

54:15.280 --> 54:16.616
Come on, Syd,
you're better than this.

54:16.640 --> 54:18.776
- Come on, just turn around.
- Come on, Syd, you got this.

54:18.800 --> 54:21.929
Come on Syd, you started it,
you got to finish it.

54:22.000 --> 54:25.049
Come on, you got it, you got it.

54:30.600 --> 54:31.931
Sydney, deep breath.

54:32.000 --> 54:33.960
- Just take a deep breath, Sydney.
- It's alright.

54:34.040 --> 54:37.362
Get in here, she's gonna do it.

54:37.440 --> 54:39.096
- I got this, okay.
- There you go, come on.

54:39.120 --> 54:41.407
There you go, there you go.

54:47.320 --> 54:49.049
Come on Syd, you got this.

54:49.120 --> 54:51.964
Liv, Liv, Liv, come, come, come.

54:52.040 --> 54:56.045
- Excuse me, excuse me.
- Oh, my God. Sydney.

54:56.120 --> 54:58.616
- Be careful, be careful, Syd.
- What are you doing?

54:58.640 --> 55:00.085
Oh, my God.

55:00.160 --> 55:02.731
You don't have to do this, come back.

55:02.800 --> 55:03.847
Shut up.

55:03.920 --> 55:06.082
Sydney, come back.

55:08.840 --> 55:10.604
<i>Come on, yeah, there you go.</i>

55:17.240 --> 55:19.296
- You don't have to do this.
- Take your time, Syd, don't look down.

55:19.320 --> 55:21.129
This is a stupid game.

55:21.200 --> 55:24.249
Come on, we're right here.
You can always turn back, Syd.

55:24.320 --> 55:25.536
Come on, come on, you got to film.

55:25.560 --> 55:27.767
Sydney, it's not gonna
count unless you film it.

55:27.840 --> 55:29.410
Don't worry about the phone.

55:29.480 --> 55:31.244
She has to film it, she can't...

55:31.320 --> 55:33.560
It doesn't count unless she
films it, she has to film it.

55:33.600 --> 55:35.456
- Just bail and come back.
- She has to film it.

55:35.480 --> 55:37.847
- No, but she has to film it.
- Shut up, Chuck.

55:37.920 --> 55:38.921
Oh, my God.

55:44.360 --> 55:47.443
I can't, oh, my God,
I can't, I can't.

55:53.760 --> 55:55.816
Sydney, you got to get up,
you gotta do something.

55:55.840 --> 55:58.127
Stop yelling at me, stop.

55:59.560 --> 56:01.289
She has to get it done.

56:01.360 --> 56:03.203
Shut up.

56:03.280 --> 56:04.456
This is gonna take too long.

56:04.480 --> 56:08.201
You got to stand, you got to walk.

56:08.280 --> 56:09.725
Shut up!

56:09.800 --> 56:11.290
Shut up, Chuck.

56:11.360 --> 56:15.081
You heard her, Chuck shut up.

56:15.160 --> 56:17.925
She's gotta get it done.

56:18.000 --> 56:22.369
She's not gonna get here in time
unless she gets up and walks.

56:22.480 --> 56:24.005
She has to, she's wasting time.

56:24.080 --> 56:25.923
Shut up both of you.

56:32.840 --> 56:35.844
Come on Syd, you got this.

56:46.160 --> 56:49.084
I can't, I can't, I can't.
I bail, I bail, I bail.

56:50.800 --> 56:52.404
<i>You bail.</i>

56:56.640 --> 56:58.881
<i>- You fail.
- Someone help him out of there.</i>

57:03.760 --> 57:05.649
<i>You fail.</i>

57:08.080 --> 57:09.605
<i>This is so dumb.</i>

57:11.360 --> 57:13.416
<i>- Hey, come here, hold on.
- You fail.</i>

57:13.440 --> 57:15.044
<i>What are you doing, get over here.</i>

59:18.120 --> 59:19.406
Vee.

59:21.160 --> 59:25.643
Hi, oh, my gosh, you guys
are so famous right now.

59:25.720 --> 59:27.563
Oh, wait till Syd sees you.

59:27.640 --> 59:30.530
- Where is she?
- Oh, you guys don't know?

59:31.560 --> 59:35.201
Yeah, she tried to
walk across that ladder and just bailed.

59:35.280 --> 59:36.936
- Is she out of the game?
- Yeah, let's get a drink.

59:36.960 --> 59:39.042
Yeah, it wasn't pretty.

59:45.200 --> 59:47.601
- Have you seen Sydney?
- Yeah.

59:47.680 --> 59:48.681
Syd.

59:55.600 --> 59:59.844
Oh, come on, Vee,
you never even spoke to him.

59:59.920 --> 01:00:03.129
It's fine, certainly no surprise.

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:04.326
Sorry.

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:09.280
Yeah, I know it's not a surprise.
You know what's not fine though.

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:13.285
I almost died tonight, Vee,
and you were nowhere to be found.

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:15.840
I'm sorry, when you said
I should live my life,

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:18.321
did you mean I should live
my life in your shadow?

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:19.616
I was just trying to help you, Vee,

01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:22.610
because you're the most
repressed person that I know.

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:27.206
Wasn't that why you keep me around?
Because I never tell you the truth?

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:29.044
- Yeah.
- Come on, let's go.

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:31.646
I guess you don't tell me the truth.

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:34.883
Because you never told me
about how insecure I am.

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:38.885
Or about how I just have
a revolving door of guys all the time.

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:42.043
You never tell me that
but you've told everyone that tonight.

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:45.249
So please, Vee, go right
ahead and show us all

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:48.164
what a fiery little spark
plug you've become since lunch.

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:50.481
Let's go.

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:52.085
Shots fired.

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:54.242
Don't walk away from me, Vee.

01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:56.448
Wake up, this is a game.

01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:57.896
<i>Do you really think
that someone like him</i>

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.616
<i>is actually gonna be with you
when this is all done?</i>

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:00.641
Wait, you don't know me.

01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:02.569
Oh, I'm sorry,
you really like her now?

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:03.880
Yeah, I do.

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:05.096
<i>Alright, come on Syd,
you're just drunk.</i>

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:07.202
<i>Tommy, it is time to get over her.</i>

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:09.408
Clearly she has traded up.

01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:12.006
Why do you have to be such a bitch?

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:16.642
Look at that, little Vee
finally speaking her mind.

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:18.961
<i>Come on, unburden yourself.</i>

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:24.444
You know why we're best friends?
I do whatever you want all the time.

01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:25.931
<i>No, Vee.</i>

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:31.450
<i>We're friends because
I'm fun and you're boring.</i>

01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:35.646
The only fun thing about
you was your brother.

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:38.086
What is it you think?

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:41.004
That playing Nerve is just gonna
magically make you a different person?

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:44.641
That's not how life works,
you'll never be a player.

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:46.728
Right, right.

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:49.451
I know how much you love
living in the moment, Syd.

01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:52.888
Well remember this
moment because you're one of those girls

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:54.564
who peaks in high school.

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:57.450
And you wake up one day still
living in Staten Island,

01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:58.965
still screwing the same guys,

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:01.168
wondering what the hell
happened to your life.

01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:03.720
If you want to know
where I am from now on,

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:05.564
sign up and watch me.

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:14.008
Wait, Vee, what are you doing?

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:18.210
Hey, hey, Vee,
you don't need to do this.

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:20.296
Look at me, come on, let's just go.
Let's bail, alright?

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:21.560
What do you have to prove?

01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:24.405
Come on, please, let's go.

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:29.167
You got it, Vee, please.

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:31.083
Go, girl!

01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:38.570
Oh, my God, Vee.

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:40.529
Whoa!

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:18.086
That'll take you into first, Vee!

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:21.481
That was messed up.

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:23.016
I can't deal with this
right now, I'm gonna go.

01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:25.486
Vee, do you know that
he's played Nerve before?

01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:26.686
What?

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:28.816
Yeah, it was his dare to get
you here and fight with Syd.

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:30.569
That's why he brought you here.

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:31.971
Look.

01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:35.969
Do you still trust him?

01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:43.565
Vee, wait, wait.

01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:46.086
- Is it true?
- Is what true?

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:49.004
Did you take me here
as part of the game?

01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:52.363
Answer me, is it true?

01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:01.608
- What are you doing?
- It's more complicated than that.

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:03.603
I just lost my
two best friends tonight.

01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:05.320
- I know.
- How much did you get for that?

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:06.496
No, no, it's not about
the money, alright?

01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:08.488
But I promise,
I'll explain to you later.

01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:10.976
Just don't even bother, okay?
I mean, Sydney almost died tonight.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.526
- I almost died tonight.
- Vee, I know, I know.

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:15.921
This game is sick,
I'm going to the police.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.604
Wait, no, no, no.

01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:20.444
- I'm sorry.
- What are you doing?

01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:22.576
I'm sorry, you can't do that, alright?
You can't go to the police.

01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:24.921
Why not?
Because I'll lose the game?

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.209
No, it's not about that.
Vee, Vee.

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:32.210
You can't go to the police.
It's the last thing you wanna do.

01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:35.682
Vee, wait, I was trying to hurt you.
It just got out of control.

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:38.206
Move, just get out of my way.

01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:40.767
Officer!

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:48.683
Officer, officer, I need help. I'm
playing this game, it's called Nerve.

01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:51.650
And I'm worried that someone's
gonna get really hurt.

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:54.087
Snitch.

01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:57.568
- That game, are they playing too?
- Yeah.

01:04:57.640 --> 01:04:59.324
Dude, get out of this.

01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:01.363
Is there a crime being committed?

01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:05.809
No, but a kid could die tonight.

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:07.720
Look, here, it's all on
my phone, you can see.

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:17.209
What? What?

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:21.331
Snitch! Snitch!

01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:32.403
- Mom?
<i>- Honey, what's going on?</i>

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:36.405
- Mom!
<i>- Vee, where are you?</i>

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:39.484
All the money is missing
from our account!

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:42.291
- Wait, what?
- Vee, honey, are you in trouble?

01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:44.966
<i>Can you just please
tell me what's going on?</i>

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:47.646
Okay, Mom, I'm gonna
fix this I promise.

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:49.361
<i>Fix what?</i>

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:52.887
Hello?
Vee, hello, Vee?

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:56.851
I'm sorry but I
got to win this game.

01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:57.649
<i>Hello, Vee.</i>

01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:01.441
<i>You broke the rules,
you are our prisoner.</i>

01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:03.682
<i>We told you not to snitch.</i>

01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:07.406
<i>Now we control your life.</i>

01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:10.131
<i>We control your family.</i>

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:12.089
<i>We control your future.</i>

01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:17.160
<i>The only way out is to
win the final round.</i>

01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:20.801
<i>Go to the Staten Island ferry
and the Watchers will find you.</i>

01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:24.646
<i>See you in the finals,
see you in the finals...</i>

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:15.441
I'm coming for you, Vee!

01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:28.045
- Vee, thank God, are you okay?
- Am I okay? No, I'm not okay.

01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:29.645
You need to tell me everything.

01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:31.616
- Okay, what the hell is going on?
- Come here, come here.

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:33.404
Why is this happening to me?

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:38.770
That guy, Ty, we both played
Nerve last year in Seattle.

01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:42.367
We got a dare to hang from a
construction crane, 200 feet in the air.

01:08:42.439 --> 01:08:45.205
The two of us
and this kid named Robby.

01:08:45.279 --> 01:08:46.725
Five, four, three

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:48.095
Come on, Robby, that's enough.

01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:49.176
- Got it?
- Shit, he's slipping.

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:50.406
Two, one.

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:53.569
Come on, grab my
hand, man, grab my hand.

01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:56.962
Ty and I, we bailed
and we went to the cops.

01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:59.850
We tried to get the game shut down
but they didn't do anything.

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:02.082
No, they just called it an accident.

01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:07.486
Then, the Watchers
came after us for snitching.

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:11.121
But they messed with my dad's job,
they leaked photos of my sister online,

01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:14.568
they stole our identities, Vee.

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:17.450
Me and Ty, we became
prisoners of the game.

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:19.010
Oh, come on, what
does that even mean?

01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:21.765
It's the third category.

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:24.002
Watcher, Player, Prisoner.

01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:29.611
I'm trapped.
The only way out is to win.

01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:38.765
- So, you have to win.
- No... No, you do.

01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:42.720
- What?
- Vee, you're a Prisoner now.

01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:46.087
Okay, you and I, we're going to the
final round together and I'm gonna lose.

01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:49.010
- What, no, you can't do that.
- It's already done, it's already done.

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:50.216
I told the Watchers to give me a dare

01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:52.527
that's gonna knock Ty
out of second place.

01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:54.283
It's gonna be me and you.

01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:00.530
- I have to go.
- No, no, no.

01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:02.056
Okay, I wanna take you
somewhere safe, let's go.

01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:03.605
There has to be another way.

01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:04.881
There isn't.

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:11.082
If it's not me in the finals, then
it's Ty and he'll do anything to win.

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:15.565
Just tell me we're gonna do this.

01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:40.284
Hey, it's not your fault.

01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:44.448
I just hope she's okay.

01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:50.170
- Hello?
<i>- Guys, it's me.</i>

01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:52.925
Oh, my God, Vee, where are you?

01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:24.486
I'm so sorry.

01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:25.936
It doesn't matter,
I'm just glad you're okay.

01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:28.201
- Alright, guys, come on, let's go.
- I can't.

01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:29.770
What?

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:31.251
I have to finish this.

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:32.446
Are you insane?

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:34.249
Vee, what are you talking about?

01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:37.164
It's never gonna end, I mean,
even if they live me alone,

01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:38.616
they're just gonna do
it to somebody else.

01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:41.325
We can't stop the game if we wanted to.
There's no one to stop.

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:43.886
It's just a bunch of anonymous people.

01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:48.165
What if they weren't anonymous?

01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:51.616
<i>Ian's doing a dare that
will put him to the final,</i>

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:53.290
<i>so it could be me against him.</i>

01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:55.124
Vee, do you actually trust this guy?

01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:57.806
He's the person who got you
into this mess in the first place.

01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:05.842
I got me into this mess.

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:09.481
Anything Ian's doing now
is to help me get out.

01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:21.803
I know it sounds
crazy but I can do it.

01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:23.723
I just need your help.

01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:27.767
What do you need us to do?

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:30.366
Tommy, you said the game
is open source, right?

01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:32.249
<i>Do you think you
can change the code?</i>

01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:34.049
<i>It's gonna take time.</i>

01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:36.686
<i>Syd, could you buy us some?</i>

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.721
Hey, now climb the cranes.

01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:47.930
Syd.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.480
- Yeah?
- Use a pay phone.

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:36.009
<i>Hang for five seconds.</i>

01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:37.923
<i>Hang for five seconds.</i>

01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:56.043
<i>Hang with one hand,
hang with one hand.</i>

01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:57.685
Shit.

01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:19.163
One, two, three...

01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:22.244
...four, five!

01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:50.576
<i>It's over here, Tommy.
You don't have a lot of time.</i>

01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:53.888
Okay, yeah, we're on our way,
we'll see you soon. How did it go?

01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:56.008
- It went.
- It went?

01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:59.082
Yeah, I think it's gonna work.

01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:00.844
Yeah, better work.

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:42.530
What is this place?

01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:45.644
Fastest Internet in New York City.

01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:49.521
- Hey, Tommy!
- Hey, HK, we made it.

01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:51.536
- Let's get this started, you ready?
- Is the botnet up and running?

01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:55.007
Yeah, of course.
We just gotta enter it into the system.

01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:58.084
Oh and this is
Sydney, obviously.

01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:01.323
Hey, welcome to the cloud.
Sucks you got axed.

01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:04.483
Alright, let's take this game down.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.764
Okay, how's this gonna work?

01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:26.002
It's like Wikipedia,
where anyone can edit the code

01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:28.009
but the majority has to approve it.

01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:30.282
And the botnet can outvote everyone.

01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:34.524
Yo, I got a army of bots
here waitin' for orders.

01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:38.642
- Hey, Nancy.
<i>- Where is Vee, what is this game?</i>

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:41.256
- <i>Don't worry, she's okay.</i>
- I want you to explain it to me.

01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:42.416
I'm gonna give you an address.

01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:46.650
Okay, if you meet me here,
I'll explain everything.

01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:29.410
Ticket.

01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:43.051
Better hurry up.

01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:46.610
Guys, it's starting!

01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:11.205
<i>Vee, Vee, Vee, Vee.</i>

01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:38.770
<i>Players, stop!</i>

01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:40.451
<i>Back up.</i>

01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:48.167
<i>Stop.</i>

01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:49.844
Alright, how many
bots do we got in?

01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:53.447
Not enough yet,
but we are getting there.

01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:05.962
<i>Players, show us your weapons.</i>

01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:19.284
<i>First to shoot wins.</i>

01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:24.322
<i>20 seconds on the clock.</i>

01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:27.524
20 seconds?

01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:28.681
HK, I need backup!

01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:30.643
<i>- Begin.</i>
- Do it.

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:34.484
<i>Start by just raising your gun.
Just raise your gun slowly.</i>

01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:36.176
Then shoot me in the shoulder,
I'll be fine.

01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:38.328
What if I miss?
I don't know if I can do this.

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:40.482
Oh, come on,
just shut up and play the game!

01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:46.688
Vee, you have to hurry, alright?

01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:49.604
You have to do this,
this is the only way the game can end

01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:51.887
and then you can walk away.

01:20:56.840 --> 01:21:03.530
<i>Five, four, three, two, one.</i>

01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:08.446
I'm not doing this.

01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:09.641
Vee, don't, you can't...

01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:16.045
I'll do it!

01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:21.281
Oh, shit.

01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:23.761
They're onto us,
they're blockin' all of our foreign IPs.

01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:25.683
Tommy, do something!

01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:32.804
Did y'all miss me?

01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:37.920
And I say we do that dare again.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.684
<i>With someone who's
really ready to play.</i>

01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:40.761
Yeah!

01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:43.764
Don't do it, Ty,
it's not worth it, man.

01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:46.366
Stop!
Whoa, whoa, back up.

01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:48.736
You have lost your mind,
pretty boy, get back!

01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:50.960
Is this what you really want?
For us to kill each other?

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.321
- Yeah!
- Of course that's what you want.

01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:55.204
Kill 'em!

01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:57.203
You think that takes nerve?

01:21:57.280 --> 01:22:01.001
Why don't you take off your
masks and show yourselves, huh?

01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:03.082
You, take off your mask.

01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:05.083
Yeah, what's your name?

01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:11.090
<i>It's easy for you to
be brave in a crowd.</i>

01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:14.004
<i>Hiding behind your screen names.</i>

01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:16.401
Don't you guys see
that you're all still responsible

01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:19.927
for what happens tonight
even if you are just watching?

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.765
Oh, my God, are you really
believing this bullshit?

01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:26.526
Play to win!

01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:31.567
You guys really want one
of us to die, for a game?

01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:34.883
Yes, yes!

01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:38.051
Then shoot me.

01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:41.561
I dare you.

01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:45.171
Okay.

01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:48.043
Who wants me to shoot her?

01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:49.770
Vee, what are you doing?

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:52.730
Who wants me to shoot her?

01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:54.768
- Tommy, where's Vee?
- Alright, calm down.

01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:56.365
What is this game,
I want answers.

01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:57.487
What are you doing?

01:22:57.560 --> 01:22:59.722
You better tell me right
now or I'm calling the cops.

01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:01.404
- No, no cops.
- No, Nancy, calm down.

01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:03.084
Do you want me to shoot her?

01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:05.731
- Shoot to kill, shoot to kill!
- Then vote "Yes."

01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:09.282
Vote "Yes" if you
want me to shoot her!

01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:11.966
- Don't say "Yes!", say "No!"
- You want me to shoot her?

01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:14.122
You want me to shoot her?

01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:17.641
Come on guys, "No!"

01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:21.766
Guys, vote "No"!

01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:25.447
You, vote "Yes", vote "Yes"!

01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:44.522
Let me know, vote "Yes"!

01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:52.525
Come on, let's have
a little bit of anarchy.

01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:56.446
Alright, we're getting around them.
The IPs are coming in faster now.

01:23:56.520 --> 01:23:57.806
Vee, we need to go, right now!

01:23:57.880 --> 01:23:59.086
Oh. my God!

01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:01.367
Okay, alright,
come on, guys, keep it going.

01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:10.485
Oh, my God, Vee.

01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:20.888
Vee, please, please.

01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:22.769
No, no, no.

01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:26.402
Look at me, Vee, please!

01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:30.881
Go.

01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:52.365
That's my real name.

01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:47.486
<i>No, wait, stop, stop!</i>

01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:48.846
My God!

01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:50.445
<i>It's okay, it's okay!</i>

01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:53.524
Stop, it's okay, I'm okay.
It's okay.

01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:55.721
Oh. my God!

01:25:56.760 --> 01:25:57.886
Sorry.

01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:02.803
You were in on this?

01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:05.884
It was her plan, man,
her friend Sydney called me.

01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:07.405
That's why I'm here.

01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:08.766
The gun, what?

01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:10.001
Blanks, bro.

01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:16.441
It's fake.

01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:19.881
Oh. my God!

01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:26.646
You scared me.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.161
We cool?

01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:33.240
Yeah, we're free.

01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:36.324
She's a badass, watch out for her.

01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:41.176
<i>- That's it, the last Player's out.
- Did we get it?</i>

01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:42.576
<i>They're out, think it's crashing!</i>

01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:46.810
- We got it?
- And Nerve is officially offline!

01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:48.848
We have gamed the game.

01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:52.481
You guys are the dumbest
smart kids I've ever met.

01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:55.683
- I'm so sorry.
- No no, I'm sorry.

01:26:55.760 --> 01:26:59.207
I'm sorry for bringing
you into all this.

01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:04.042
I just wish that we
could've met some other way.

01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:06.290
I don't.

01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:09.164
Oh, man!

01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:10.480
And you.

01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:13.085
What a rock star.

01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:16.448
Looks like I can get
all your money back.

01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:18.329
They don't call me
Hacker Kween for nothin'.
