What?

08:24.238 --> 08:24.836

08:35.816 --> 08:38.250
I have something
very important
to tell you.

08:38.252 --> 08:41.253
The Kremps
are coming over
for a barbecue.

08:41.255 --> 08:43.421
Yes! That is big!

08:43.423 --> 08:46.091
Now let's focus on this
and not my thing.

08:46.093 --> 08:48.360
Tell us more about this
important barbecue.

08:48.362 --> 08:50.929
Wait, are we talking
about all the Kremps here,

08:50.931 --> 08:51.763

and the one that's my age

You still want
to have a barbecue
with these people,

08:58.338 --> 09:00.805
even though that woman's
terrified of you?

09:00.807 --> 09:01.673
Not anymore.

09:01.675 --> 09:03.141
I woke up early
this morning,

09:03.143 --> 09:04.943
followed her
for two miles on foot,

09:04.945 --> 09:07.178
then chased her down
and convinced her

09:07.180 --> 09:09.180
there's nothing
scary about me.

09:09.182 --> 09:12.617
Come on. I had nothing
planned this weekend.

09:12.619 --> 09:13.218
It was perfect.

09:13.220 --> 09:16.087
Well, now you do.
And you will be
warm and inviting,

09:16.089 --> 09:20.659
and so help me God,
you better not fall asleep
in front of these people.

09:20.661 --> 09:24.095

09:31.171 --> 09:32.804
We need to be on
our best behavior.

no dirty jokes,

09:34.441 --> 09:36.441
no limericks,
no lewd comments.

09:36.443 --> 09:38.910

a real drag.

16:20.080 --> 16:20.712
Mrs. Goldberg,

16:20.714 --> 16:22.213
I... I didn't know
you two knew each other.

16:22.215 --> 16:23.581
Damn right we do.
We're neighbors.

16:23.583 --> 16:27.251
Now... Go back
and get her
some fresh eclairs.

16:27.253 --> 16:28.720
Or would you
like a repeat...

16:28.722 --> 16:32.090
(LOUDLY)
...of the birthday
cake fiasco?

16:32.092 --> 16:34.759
Who writes
"Sorry for your loss"

16:34.761 --> 16:36.127
on a 10-year-old's
birthday cake?

16:36.129 --> 16:39.163
It was a mistake,
and Victor was let go.
Yeah.

16:39.165 --> 16:41.833
Well, that was a dark day
for this store.

16:41.835 --> 16:44.535
But it could get
a lot darker.

16:44.537 --> 16:45.603
I'll take care of it.

16:45.605 --> 16:48.673
Sorry, ma'am.
I'll fix you right up.

16:49.141 --> 16:51.609
(SIGHS)

16:51.977 --> 16:54.879
I know I just made
a big, loud scene.

16:56.215 --> 16:58.683
It's just what I do.

17:01.887 --> 17:04.389
Knock, knock. Honey?

17:04.456 --> 17:05.623
Are you in there?

17:05.625 --> 17:08.559
ADAM: Go away.
I don't wanna talk to you.

17:09.962 --> 17:13.031
You're right.
I should give you
some space.

17:15.034 --> 17:18.369
At least close the door,
and don't turn on
the lights.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.638
Darkness is my only friend.

17:23.575 --> 17:25.143
(DOOR CLOSING)

17:25.644 --> 17:27.111
BEVERLY:
Adam, I am so sorry.

17:27.113 --> 17:29.347
ADAM: You should be sorry!
Look at me!

17:29.349 --> 17:31.682
I'm in a glow-in-the-dark
unitard!

17:31.684 --> 17:34.852
(SIGHS) And Chad
was the only friend
that got me...

17:34.854 --> 17:36.187
Who got  <i>this!</i>

17:36.189 --> 17:38.189
And you just had to
ruin it...

17:38.191 --> 17:42.827
Just because one person
in this world
didn't like you.

17:43.896 --> 17:44.896
(SWITCH CLICKS)

17:44.898 --> 17:48.933
Sweetie, you're the one
that matters.

17:49.301 --> 17:50.435
I'd rather have nobody
like me

17:50.437 --> 17:53.938
than have you be
mad at me forever.

17:57.042 --> 18:00.678
Not forever, just for
about a month and a half.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.413
Well...

18:02.415 --> 18:04.882
Let's see if I can
shorten that up
just a bit.

18:04.884 --> 18:07.585
(STARSHIP'S  <i>NOTHING'S GONNA</i>

Yo.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.091
Whatcha doin'?

18:13.093 --> 18:14.258
Nothing.

18:14.260 --> 18:15.760
Want to finish our movie?

18:15.762 --> 18:16.561
Yeah. Do you?

18:16.563 --> 18:18.996
(CHUCKLES) Hell, yeah.
Chad, "h" word.

18:18.998 --> 18:20.565
Sorry.

18:23.902 --> 18:25.369
Cool.

18:26.371 --> 18:29.207
What the hell's
the "h" word?

18:29.775 --> 18:32.410
So I was thinking
tomorrow we could
go for a power walk.

18:32.412 --> 18:36.114
And then you could
come over and we could
split an eclair.

18:36.116 --> 18:38.149
Or I could come over
right now,

18:38.151 --> 18:40.151
and we could each have
our  <i>own</i> eclair.

18:40.153 --> 18:42.553
Mmm, Beverly Goldberg,
you are bad.
(CHUCKLES)

18:42.555 --> 18:45.790
I am bad.
I am the worst.
(LAUGHS)

18:45.792 --> 18:47.992
Let's do it.
(WHISPERS) Let's do it.

18:47.994 --> 18:48.426
Okay.
