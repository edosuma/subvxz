[yawns]

01:04.230 --> 01:05.230
[Doc] No way!

01:11.196 --> 01:13.948
Snow! Lambie, Stuffy, Chilly!

01:14.032 --> 01:15.742
It's snowing!
It's snowing!

01:16.993 --> 01:18.495
Guys, didn't you hear me?

01:20.622 --> 01:22.707
Oh, oops,
I guess you didn't.

01:28.755 --> 01:29.839
-Ooh.
-Oh!

01:29.923 --> 01:30.965
Good morning, Doc!

01:31.049 --> 01:32.717
I'm up. I am up!

01:33.176 --> 01:34.344
What is it, Doc?

01:34.427 --> 01:35.386
Take a look.

01:37.055 --> 01:37.972
[both exclaim]

01:38.056 --> 01:39.265
Let me see!

01:39.557 --> 01:42.310
Doc!
Somebody erased the grass!

01:42.602 --> 01:45.063
No, Chilly.
It snowed last night.

01:45.730 --> 01:47.732
Haven't you ever seen
real snow before?

01:48.149 --> 01:50.151
Of course
I've seen snow.

01:50.401 --> 01:52.237
I'm a snowman.

01:52.487 --> 01:55.031
You know,
just not for a while.

01:55.532 --> 01:57.075
And maybe not up close.

01:57.826 --> 01:59.577
I've always wanted
to play in it.

01:59.661 --> 02:02.539
And meet another snowman.

02:03.164 --> 02:04.916
Well, what are
we waiting for?

02:05.250 --> 02:07.544
Nothing!
Let's go play in the snow!

02:07.836 --> 02:09.419
-Awesome!
-Baa-rilliant!

02:09.503 --> 02:10.380
Yay.

02:10.463 --> 02:11.965
Chilly? You okay?

02:12.507 --> 02:15.760
I'm worried
the other snowmen
won't like me.

02:16.177 --> 02:17.387
Oh, are you kidding?

02:17.637 --> 02:20.515
They're going to love you.
Just like we do.

02:20.932 --> 02:23.893
Oh, thanks, Lambie.
I needed that.

02:24.602 --> 02:26.020
Are you guys coming?

02:26.104 --> 02:29.816
Yeah! Snow,
here I come!

02:30.859 --> 02:33.027
Hey, Doc.
Want to go out...
Can't talk now!

02:33.111 --> 02:35.989
I'm going outside
to play in the snow!
Hold on, Doc!

02:36.239 --> 02:38.324
I know you're excited
to go outside,

02:38.408 --> 02:39.868
but you got to bundle up.

02:39.951 --> 02:40.910
It's cold out there.

02:41.369 --> 02:42.704
Oh, yeah. Thanks, Dad.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.624
This is going to be fun!

02:47.584 --> 02:49.752
-[Stuffy] Whoa!
-[Lambie] Baa-utiful!

02:49.836 --> 02:50.920
Snow! This is amazing!

02:51.004 --> 02:54.007
It's like I'm one
with the snow.

02:54.090 --> 02:54.924
[screams]

02:55.008 --> 02:55.925
Snow is cold!

02:58.511 --> 02:59.679
You okay, Chilly?

02:59.762 --> 03:01.681
Oh, sure!
Just the way I like it.

03:01.764 --> 03:05.435
But, you know,
I think I'll just stick
to staying on top of the snow.

03:05.518 --> 03:08.688
Not me!
Falling into snow is fun.

03:10.148 --> 03:11.149
Ugh!

03:13.818 --> 03:16.863
[Stuffy]
It's a snow-dragon-angel.
One of a kind.

03:17.155 --> 03:18.907
[laughing]

03:20.450 --> 03:21.492
[giggles]

03:21.576 --> 03:23.036
I made a snow princess!

03:24.162 --> 03:25.163
[giggling]

03:26.372 --> 03:28.082
Come on, Chilly,
you try it!

03:28.166 --> 03:30.585
Oh. Well, okay.

03:32.795 --> 03:34.756
Ooh! Ah!

03:36.049 --> 03:37.175
I can't get up.

03:40.178 --> 03:42.096
-It's a snow...
-Man!

03:42.180 --> 03:44.390
It's a snowman!
Just like me.

03:44.766 --> 03:47.977
It looks great!
You sure know snow, Chilly.

03:48.311 --> 03:50.063
Yup, I sure do,
don't I.

03:50.730 --> 03:51.606
Hey.

03:51.689 --> 03:54.484
Where are all
the snowmen and ladies?

03:54.776 --> 03:58.655
You know, Chilly,
the best way to meet
a snowman is to make one!

03:58.905 --> 04:00.365
We can do that?

04:00.448 --> 04:03.243
Yeah! That's where snowmen
come from. Kids...

04:03.576 --> 04:04.994
And toys.

04:05.203 --> 04:07.205
And toys build them.

04:07.538 --> 04:09.874
I always wondered
where I came from.

04:09.958 --> 04:11.376
And now I know.

04:13.378 --> 04:16.339
What are we waiting for?
I have a friend to make.

04:16.422 --> 04:17.757
A snow friend!

04:17.966 --> 04:19.968
So, who's going
to show me how?

04:20.343 --> 04:23.054
First,
you make a big snowball.

04:23.137 --> 04:26.599
'Scuse me, Lambie,
but I happen to be
an expert snowman-maker,

04:26.683 --> 04:28.142
so maybe I should show him.

04:28.726 --> 04:30.061
Chilly, it's simple.

04:30.144 --> 04:32.063
First you get
a little ball of snow,

04:32.146 --> 04:34.315
and then you roll it
into a bigger ball,

04:34.399 --> 04:36.943
and wait, wait, no, no!
[Stuffy screams]

04:39.112 --> 04:40.738
Um, ta-da?

04:40.822 --> 04:42.782
-[Chilly chuckles]
-[Doc] Stuffy, you're so funny.

04:42.865 --> 04:44.284

Like a real snowman?

05:39.922 --> 05:41.841
Chilly, you look great.

05:42.091 --> 05:45.178
I'm going to say "Hi."

05:45.553 --> 05:48.389
I'm going to get
our snowman a hat
and a scarf!

05:48.473 --> 05:50.391
Great idea, Doc.

05:50.475 --> 05:54.020
That way all us snowmen
will be dressed the same!

05:54.604 --> 05:55.521
Be right back.

05:56.064 --> 05:58.316
[shivering]
My paws are so cold!

Ah!

06:03.488 --> 06:05.239
That's even colder!

06:05.531 --> 06:07.909
I can't help it,
I am freezing.

06:10.661 --> 06:12.455
Doesn't that look good.

06:12.538 --> 06:15.833
I tell ya, he is a chip
off the ol' snowball!

06:16.751 --> 06:19.087
Aw! That's a nice cuddle,
Lambie.

06:19.462 --> 06:24.550
[shivering]
I'm not cuddling,
I'm trying to stay warm.

06:24.884 --> 06:28.054
Doc, I don't think dragons
were made for snow either.

06:28.513 --> 06:29.555
Sorry, guys.

06:29.639 --> 06:32.600
I guess I should
have bundled you up
when we went outside.

06:32.683 --> 06:35.019
Come on, Chilly,
we're going in to get warm.

06:35.103 --> 06:38.689
But I don't
need to get warm.
I am made for snow!

06:38.940 --> 06:41.943
I'm going to hang
here with my friend.
He loves my jokes.

06:42.485 --> 06:43.361
Are you sure?

06:43.820 --> 06:45.404
Yep, I'm good here.

06:45.488 --> 06:48.533
A snowman where
he is supposed to be.

06:48.616 --> 06:50.368
In the snow. [laughs]

06:50.952 --> 06:52.620
Okay. We'll be back.

06:54.247 --> 06:57.917
So, what do snowmen
eat for lunch?

06:59.335 --> 07:00.753
Icebergers!

07:00.837 --> 07:02.547
[laughing]

07:04.257 --> 07:06.592
Oh, I guess
you've heard that one.

07:08.719 --> 07:10.304
-[Doc] Hi, Chilly!
-[Lambie] We're back!

07:10.763 --> 07:15.435
Oh, I am Toasty McRoasty!
Even my tail is warm.

07:15.518 --> 07:16.477
Chilly?

07:16.853 --> 07:18.813
[shivering] Very stiff.

07:19.605 --> 07:20.940
Chilly? Are you okay?

07:21.399 --> 07:25.445
Doc, I can't feel my feet!

07:25.528 --> 07:28.197
What's wrong with me?

07:28.865 --> 07:30.950
Chilly, you don't
have feet, remember?

07:31.534 --> 07:35.037
Can't feel nose.

07:35.496 --> 07:37.874
Huh. You do have a nose.

07:38.291 --> 07:41.335
Chilly, is there
any chance you're cold?

07:41.627 --> 07:43.588
Of course not.

07:43.671 --> 07:46.132
I'm a snowman, aren't I?

07:47.341 --> 07:49.051
Can't move!

07:49.469 --> 07:53.556
Actually, you're moving a lot.
In fact, you're shaking.

07:53.931 --> 07:58.478
I am? What is it, Doc?
What do I have?

07:59.103 --> 08:00.313
I think you're cold.

08:00.980 --> 08:03.983
But snowmen
don't get cold.

08:04.442 --> 08:07.987
Real snowmen might not,
but stuffed snowmen do.

08:08.321 --> 08:11.532
And, Chilly, you're stuffed.
Come on,

08:11.616 --> 08:13.534
we need to get you
to the clinic

08:13.618 --> 08:15.786
to make sure
there's nothing else
wrong with you.

08:16.245 --> 08:19.832
I'm sorry you had
to see me this way.

08:24.462 --> 08:25.588
The Doc is in!

08:29.800 --> 08:31.093
[shivering] Snow.

08:32.094 --> 08:33.095
Cold.

08:33.179 --> 08:36.015
Chilly!
What the sweet potato fries
is going on with you?

08:36.432 --> 08:39.393
He was out there all morning
with no warm clothes.

08:39.852 --> 08:42.230
Chilly, don't you
know it's colder

08:42.313 --> 08:44.273
than an ice cream
in Alaska out there?

08:50.530 --> 08:52.365
[heart beating]

08:53.991 --> 08:56.160
Okay. It's stuck on me!

08:56.244 --> 08:58.079
That can't be good!

08:58.412 --> 08:59.956
You're really frozen.

09:00.665 --> 09:01.874
It's over.

09:03.626 --> 09:05.795
Chilly, I haven't lost
a patient yet,

09:05.878 --> 09:07.588
and I'm not going
to start now,

09:07.672 --> 09:10.216
especially on one
of my best friends!

09:10.675 --> 09:13.386
Wait, are you
talking about me?

09:13.803 --> 09:15.137
Of course I am.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.559
Here's your knee hammer
to check his reflexes, Doc.

09:19.976 --> 09:20.810
Thanks.

09:21.102 --> 09:23.020
Wait, Chilly doesn't
have any knees.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.314
What? I have no knees!

09:25.565 --> 09:26.482
Chilly!

09:26.691 --> 09:28.818
[all] You never had knees!

09:29.026 --> 09:31.821
Oh! [laughs] Right.
Good. What's next, Doc?

09:32.488 --> 09:34.824
I'm going to check
your temperature.

09:38.327 --> 09:39.787
Your temperature
is really low.

09:40.454 --> 09:41.914
I have a diagnosis.

09:43.708 --> 09:44.834
What is it, Doc?

09:45.334 --> 09:47.253
Chilly has Brr-itis.

09:47.795 --> 09:50.506
Well, this looks like
a <span style="style.default_1">Big Book of Boo-Boos</span>
bonanza to me.

09:54.010 --> 09:57.847
Doc, I guess I should just
hang up my carrot nose

09:57.930 --> 10:00.266
'cause I can't call
myself a real snowman.

10:01.183 --> 10:03.728
You're right, Chilly.
You're not a real snowman.

10:03.811 --> 10:05.730
But, you're a great toy.

10:06.105 --> 10:09.233
And you're the best
stuffed snowman I know.

10:09.859 --> 10:13.237
[sniffles]
Yeah, what she said,
you big galoot.

10:14.322 --> 10:15.323
[sniffling]

10:16.032 --> 10:18.743
Thanks, guys,
that means a lot.

10:19.535 --> 10:23.789
So, can we get my stuffing
warmed up a little bit more?

10:24.081 --> 10:25.124
Oh, yeah, Chilly!

10:25.207 --> 10:26.876
-On it!
-Let's do it!

10:29.211 --> 10:31.881
Here, this will warm you up.

10:32.465 --> 10:35.885
That's a great idea,
let's all give
Chilly a cuddle!

10:36.385 --> 10:37.261
[all] Oh!

10:37.345 --> 10:40.473
It feels good to get a hug.
The best medicine yet.

10:40.556 --> 10:43.684
[Dad] Hey, Doc.
[whispers] Now would be
a good time to go stuffed!

10:43.768 --> 10:45.061
What's going on out here?

10:45.561 --> 10:47.855
[nervous chuckles]
Oh, nothing.

10:48.189 --> 10:50.816
Somebody looks
like they could use
some hot chocolate.

10:50.900 --> 10:51.901
Thanks, Dad!

10:55.196 --> 10:56.238
Oh.

10:56.572 --> 10:59.825
This is warm enough
to make my snow melt!

10:59.909 --> 11:02.536
You don't have
any snow to melt,
remember?

11:02.912 --> 11:03.829
[laughs]

11:03.913 --> 11:07.833
Oh, yeah, right.
And that's okay by me!

11:08.584 --> 11:10.127
How're you feeling,
Chilly?

11:10.211 --> 11:11.420
I'm great now, Doc!

11:11.712 --> 11:13.672
I am toasty-roasty.

11:14.507 --> 11:17.718
In fact, I'm so warm
I'm ready to go back out!

11:18.386 --> 11:20.179
-Wait!
-Come on, Doc!

11:20.262 --> 11:22.014
I may not be a real snowman,

11:22.098 --> 11:24.475
but I still love
playing in the snow!

11:24.934 --> 11:28.813
I understand,
but you need to put on
warm clothes first.

11:28.896 --> 11:30.981
Everyone has to dress right
for cold weather.

11:31.315 --> 11:32.358
[chuckles]

11:32.441 --> 11:36.070
Well, maybe I could use
just these mittens,

11:36.737 --> 11:39.323
and that coat,
and that hat over there.

11:41.033 --> 11:44.662
Now I can stand
out here all day,
just like this guy.

Here I come!

12:09.979 --> 12:10.980
[Doc] I got you!

12:15.734 --> 12:17.153
[Doc reading]

12:22.408 --> 12:23.242
There!

12:23.325 --> 12:25.411
A picture of me
and my favorite cousin.

12:25.995 --> 12:27.788
[chuckles]
And who's that?

12:28.205 --> 12:29.665
You are, Tisha!

12:30.082 --> 12:31.667
[both laughing]

12:32.293 --> 12:34.128
Tisha, I think
you should head home

12:34.211 --> 12:35.713
before the snow
gets too deep.

12:36.380 --> 12:38.549
Here, you can keep this.

12:38.841 --> 12:41.343
Oh! Thanks, Doc!
And you know what?

12:41.719 --> 12:43.179
I brought something
for you too!

12:43.554 --> 12:45.598
It's Professor Hootsburgh!

12:45.681 --> 12:47.766
The last time
you came to my house

12:47.850 --> 12:49.518
I saw how much
you liked Hootsy.

12:49.810 --> 12:51.270
I don't play
with her anymore,

12:51.353 --> 12:54.023
so I thought
you could have her.
Wow!

12:54.398 --> 12:55.733
Thanks, Tisha!

12:57.818 --> 12:59.028
See ya!

12:59.403 --> 13:02.531
Bye! And thanks for Hootsy.

13:11.874 --> 13:13.959
Hi, everyone! Guess what?

13:14.043 --> 13:17.004
My cousin Tisha
gave me a new toy.

13:17.087 --> 13:18.088
Whoo-hoo!

13:18.172 --> 13:20.090
-A new toy!
-I hope it likes me.

13:20.174 --> 13:22.176
Meet Professor Hootsburgh!

13:22.384 --> 13:25.054
A professor?
She must be smart.

13:25.346 --> 13:30.726
Indeed! I have lots of smarts
stored in this brain of mine.

13:30.809 --> 13:31.810
[laughs]

13:32.520 --> 13:36.065
Professor,
this is Lambie, Stuffy,
Squeakers, and Chilly.

13:36.440 --> 13:38.484
And I'm Doc McStuffins.

13:38.567 --> 13:42.363
Hey, nice wings.
I'm sure you noticed
I have some too.

13:42.655 --> 13:46.408
Course mine are smooth,
and yours have those fluffy
thingies all over.

13:47.076 --> 13:50.204
These thingies
are technically
called feathers.

13:50.663 --> 13:51.705
[gasps]

13:51.956 --> 13:54.375
Doc, my feathers
are all gone.

13:54.458 --> 13:56.085
I've been plucked!

13:56.502 --> 13:59.380
Science tells us
that only birds have feathers.

13:59.463 --> 14:03.008
And you're not
a bird like me.

14:03.968 --> 14:07.221
Oh! Right. [chuckles]
She is smart!

14:08.347 --> 14:11.183
How would you like it
if I read you a story?

14:11.517 --> 14:15.854
I used to read to
all the other toys
when I was Tisha's toy.

14:16.105 --> 14:18.774
-[giggles] A story!
-That sounds great!

14:19.108 --> 14:20.276
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

14:20.359 --> 14:21.735
I'll get the book!

14:22.111 --> 14:23.737
I hope it's not too scary!

14:23.821 --> 14:25.322
Coming right up!

14:26.532 --> 14:28.117
Oh! [screams]

14:28.951 --> 14:30.077
[shrieks]

14:30.160 --> 14:32.037
Um, I brought you a book!

14:33.122 --> 14:34.081
Thank you.

14:34.373 --> 14:36.709
Now, could you please
do me another favor?

14:36.959 --> 14:38.669
Sure! What else can I do?

14:39.003 --> 14:41.046
Well, if you wouldn't mind,

14:41.130 --> 14:43.173
would you please
get off of me?

14:44.508 --> 14:46.218
Oh, right. [chuckles]

14:46.677 --> 14:47.511
Sorry about that.

14:47.845 --> 14:49.054
Are you okay?

14:49.138 --> 14:50.514
I'm feeling fine.

14:51.265 --> 14:53.350
And ready for story time!

14:55.394 --> 14:57.897
This is one
of my favorite stories.

14:58.230 --> 14:59.982
<span style="style.default_1">Goldilocks</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and the Three Bears.</span>

15:00.232 --> 15:03.819
Ah, yes!
A wonderful story, indeed.

15:04.153 --> 15:07.781
Now, let's all put
on our listening caps.

15:08.032 --> 15:11.368
Oh, no! I don't have
a listening cap!

15:11.452 --> 15:12.494
[laughs]

15:12.578 --> 15:14.622
She just means it's time
to pay attention.

15:15.122 --> 15:17.791
Oh! Okay. I can do that!

15:18.542 --> 15:19.501
[clears throat]

15:20.294 --> 15:24.590
Now, for the story of <span style="style.default_1">Goldilocks</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and the Three Bears!</span>

15:25.507 --> 15:28.802
"Only upon a fine
four was a whiffle..."

15:29.887 --> 15:31.639
Is there something wrong?

15:32.181 --> 15:34.391
Well, I don't understand it.

15:34.892 --> 15:37.311
The words in this book
look all wrong to me.

15:37.853 --> 15:38.896
Huh.

15:38.979 --> 15:40.439
The words seem okay to me.

15:41.190 --> 15:42.399
Reading is what I do!

15:42.608 --> 15:44.068
But I can't read this book!

15:44.443 --> 15:46.862
There must be something
horribly wrong with me!

15:47.279 --> 15:49.573
[hooting]

15:53.494 --> 15:54.536
Oh!

15:54.620 --> 15:56.664
You look like you
could use a cuddle.

15:58.916 --> 16:00.501
Oh, thank you.

16:00.876 --> 16:03.045
I got a bad case
of the hoots there.

16:03.420 --> 16:04.338
Don't worry.

16:04.672 --> 16:06.882
We'll take you
to the clinic
for a checkup.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.551
If there's something
wrong with you,
we'll find it.

16:09.635 --> 16:12.638
You'll be able
to read us a story
before you know it!

16:24.692 --> 16:26.026
The Doc is in!

16:28.904 --> 16:30.364
Well, howdy-do there, Doc.

16:30.864 --> 16:33.033
Hallie,
this is Professor Hootsburgh.

16:33.283 --> 16:35.160
Something seems
to be wrong with her

16:35.244 --> 16:37.705
because she can't
read anymore.

16:37.788 --> 16:39.456
And I love to read!

16:40.124 --> 16:43.752
Without books,
I may as well just
fly the coop! [crying]

16:43.836 --> 16:46.755
Sure as soup
sounds like someone
is in need of a checkup!

17:17.786 --> 17:21.457
Let's run a few more tests.
Can you say "Aah" for me?

17:21.915 --> 17:23.291
Ah!

17:23.751 --> 17:25.544
Now can you say "Hoot"?

17:26.170 --> 17:27.838
Hoot.

17:28.088 --> 17:32.217
Now can you say...
[scatting]

17:33.010 --> 17:35.429
[mimics scatting]

17:35.512 --> 17:37.222
[all laughing]

17:37.306 --> 17:38.766
She's sounding pretty good.

17:39.016 --> 17:41.435
So, why can't I read?

17:41.685 --> 17:43.062
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

17:43.812 --> 17:45.105
Stuffy?

17:45.355 --> 17:47.274
What was the question again?

17:47.483 --> 17:49.860
Maybe Professor
Hootsburgh's head

17:49.943 --> 17:52.029
got squished
when Stuffy fell on her.

17:52.321 --> 17:57.076
[gasps] And maybe that made her
forget how to read!

17:58.077 --> 17:59.411
What a horrible thought!

17:59.495 --> 18:01.747
Oh, no! I didn't mean it!

18:02.247 --> 18:03.540
I know you didn't.

18:04.124 --> 18:07.419
Hallie, could you go get me
the stuffed owl size chart?

18:07.503 --> 18:08.754
Okeydokey-do, Doc!

18:10.964 --> 18:12.466
Seven inches.

18:14.009 --> 18:17.137
[Doc] Let's see,
here's the chart
for stuffed lambs,

18:17.471 --> 18:20.682
chart for blue dragons,
one for plastic dump trucks.

18:20.974 --> 18:24.228
Here's the chart
that will tell us
about stuffed owls.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.271
According to this chart,

18:26.688 --> 18:29.191
your head size
is a little bit above normal.

18:29.441 --> 18:32.069
Probably 'cause
of all the brains
she's got in there.

18:32.361 --> 18:33.821
Oh, why, thank you.

18:33.904 --> 18:37.032
My head is my favorite place
to keep my brains, after all!

18:37.574 --> 18:38.867
[all chuckling]

18:38.951 --> 18:42.746
So, I don't think your problem
is head squishing.

18:43.330 --> 18:45.249
Looks like Stuffy didn't
hurt you after all.

18:45.958 --> 18:46.792
[sighs]

18:46.875 --> 18:48.877
We still don't know
why you can't read.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.838
I'm gonna need
to run more tests.

18:50.921 --> 18:52.339
Ooh, I do love tests.

18:52.840 --> 18:55.259
I'm going to test your memory
with these flashcards.

18:55.759 --> 18:57.261
I'll show you five cards,

18:57.511 --> 18:59.721
and then see if you can
remember them all.

18:59.805 --> 19:01.014
I'm ready.

19:01.723 --> 19:07.688
Ah! It's a picture
of a chubby yellow
snake doing yoga.

19:08.272 --> 19:10.482
I thought that was
a picture of a banana!

19:11.525 --> 19:12.359
Oh!

19:12.442 --> 19:14.444
Yes. I see now.

19:15.779 --> 19:17.322
Let's go to the next one.

19:18.615 --> 19:22.411
That's a picture
of a chewed up wad
of green, goopy gum.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.496
Are you sure, sugar?

19:24.580 --> 19:27.749
That sure as syrup
looks like a frog
to this hippo's eyes.

19:28.667 --> 19:32.838
Oh, dear. Maybe I need
to get my glasses checked.

19:33.505 --> 19:35.632
Uh, what glasses?

19:35.716 --> 19:38.260
You aren't wearing any glasses.

19:39.052 --> 19:40.679
Oh, dear! [chuckles]

19:40.929 --> 19:42.764
I'm not wearing glasses.

19:43.390 --> 19:45.017
Now, where did I put them?

19:45.100 --> 19:48.937
You weren't wearing any
when Tisha gave you to me.
Maybe you lost your glasses

19:49.021 --> 19:50.355
back at Tisha's house.

19:50.731 --> 19:54.026
Oh, fiddlesticks!
I do so love my glasses.

19:54.276 --> 19:55.402
Hold on a second.

19:55.694 --> 19:56.778
What're you thinking, Doc?

19:56.862 --> 19:58.655
If you don't have
your glasses,

19:58.864 --> 20:00.824
you won't be able
to see very well.

20:00.908 --> 20:02.409
That's true.

20:02.659 --> 20:06.580
And since you can't see,
you might not be able to read
words in a book.

20:06.830 --> 20:09.291
Why, yes! You're right!

20:09.374 --> 20:12.544
You didn't forget how to read.
You just lost your glasses!

20:13.003 --> 20:15.839
Hoot!
I do believe you're right!

20:16.089 --> 20:17.633
I have a diagnosis.

20:17.716 --> 20:20.135
Hold that thought while I get
the <span style="style.default_1">Big Book of Boo-Boos!</span>

20:22.638 --> 20:23.805
Professor Hootsburgh,

20:24.097 --> 20:26.975
you've got a severe case
of Glasses-Gone-itis!

20:28.352 --> 20:29.519
What should we do?

20:30.437 --> 20:32.564
We need to find you
some new glasses!

20:32.814 --> 20:35.734
Don't you ruffle
your brain feathers,
Professor!

20:36.068 --> 20:39.071
Doc McStuffins' Clinic

<span style="style.default_1">♪ Hoot, hoot</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You could look</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Great in glasses ♪</span>

21:17.401 --> 21:20.904
<span style="style.default_1">♪ So many kinds to wear ♪</span>

21:21.280 --> 21:24.741
<span style="style.default_1">♪ Hoot, hoot</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You could look</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Great in glasses ♪</span>

21:25.158 --> 21:30.122
<span style="style.default_1">♪ Hoot, hoot, let's find</span>
<span style="style.default_1">The perfect pair ♪</span>

21:31.665 --> 21:33.583
Here's three pairs
of glasses.

21:33.834 --> 21:36.712
One of these ought to fit
Hootsy's big beautiful eyes!

21:37.379 --> 21:38.922
Let's have you
try them on

21:39.172 --> 21:41.633
and see if any of them
help you see better.

21:43.093 --> 21:45.345
Now, tell me what
you see on this chart.

21:45.429 --> 21:49.391
Oh, hoot, it just looks
like little black smudges.

21:49.683 --> 21:51.560
Ooh, try this pair.

21:52.728 --> 21:55.564
Now it looks like
little black blobs of jelly.

21:55.939 --> 21:57.649
That's not quite
right either.

21:58.942 --> 22:01.445
This pair will work,
I just know it!

22:01.695 --> 22:05.490
You look more fabulous
than a flamingo dancer
doing a fan dance!

22:05.782 --> 22:06.825
Let's see.

22:07.367 --> 22:09.911
It looks like a whale,
and a bear,

22:10.704 --> 22:13.332
and a snake and a doggie!

22:14.333 --> 22:15.292
Is that right?

22:15.500 --> 22:16.418
It sure is!

22:16.501 --> 22:18.587
Looks like you can
see clearly again!

22:18.670 --> 22:19.963
Hooray!

22:20.047 --> 22:22.299
[hooting]

22:24.343 --> 22:29.723
I mean, if I can see again,
I'll be able to read again.

22:30.265 --> 22:32.017
How delightful!

22:32.350 --> 22:35.520
In that case,
I think it's story time!

22:35.854 --> 22:37.355
-I can't wait!
-I can't wait!

22:37.439 --> 22:38.273
Story time!

22:39.524 --> 22:44.696
"Then the Mama Bear said,
'Someone's been sleeping
in my bed.'"

22:45.280 --> 22:46.406
[all gasping]

22:46.490 --> 22:47.365
Ooh!

22:47.574 --> 22:49.242
What happens next?
What happens next?

22:49.326 --> 22:50.994
Stuffy, you can't
keep interrupting.

22:51.244 --> 22:52.496
Oh! Sorry.

22:53.455 --> 22:55.874
"Then the Baby Bear said,

22:56.208 --> 22:59.377
"'Someone's been
sleeping in my bed too.

22:59.878 --> 23:01.004
"'And she's still here!'"

23:01.254 --> 23:02.631
Oh, no!
What happens then?

23:02.714 --> 23:04.591
-Stuffy!
-Sorry.

23:05.175 --> 23:09.846
"Just then, Goldilocks woke up
and saw the Three Bears.

23:10.388 --> 23:13.850
"She was so scared
that she ran away

23:13.934 --> 23:18.730
"and never bothered
the Bears again.
The End."

23:18.980 --> 23:20.941
Yay! Professor Hootsburgh!

23:21.024 --> 23:22.484
That was
the greatest story ever!

23:22.567 --> 23:24.361
[hooting]

23:24.611 --> 23:27.447
I do so love
a happy ending!

23:27.697 --> 23:29.449
And so do we.

23:29.533 --> 23:30.909
[all laughing]

23:32.994 --> 23:34.913
Hey, everybody.
It's Doc here.

23:34.996 --> 23:37.457
<span style="style.default_1">When you're out playing</span>
<span style="style.default_1">on a really hot day,</span>

23:37.541 --> 23:39.626
<span style="style.default_1">what should you</span>
<span style="style.default_1">remember to do?</span>

23:40.210 --> 23:42.629
Hold on!
<span style="style.default_1">Should you give</span>
<span style="style.default_1">a Boppy a hug?</span>

23:42.712 --> 23:44.381
[both laughing]

23:45.465 --> 23:47.342
<span style="style.default_1">Should you trumpet</span>
<span style="style.default_1">like an elephant?</span>

23:49.010 --> 23:51.138
<span style="style.default_1">Or should you drink</span>
<span style="style.default_1">plenty of water?</span>

23:52.305 --> 23:55.725
<span style="style.default_1">That's right! On a hot day,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">drink lots of water.</span>

23:58.145 --> 23:59.146
