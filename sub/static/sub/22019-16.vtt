WEBVTT

00:00.930 --> 00:03.194
JJ: PREVIOUSLY
ON "CRIMINAL MINDS"...

00:03.230 --> 00:04.367
MY INVESTIGATION
HAS REVEALED

00:04.400 --> 00:07.096
A PATTERN OF NEGLIGENCE
WITHIN THE BAU.

00:07.140 --> 00:10.303
THIS UNIT IS THE CROWN JEWEL
OF BEHAVIORAL PROFILING.

00:10.340 --> 00:11.534
I COULDN'T SHUT IT DOWN
IF I WANTED TO,

00:11.570 --> 00:13.401
BUT I CAN HELP RESTRUCTURE IT.

00:13.440 --> 00:16.079
AGENT PRENTISS, YOU'LL BE
REASSIGNED WITHIN THE BUREAU.

00:16.110 --> 00:17.372
YOUR NEW POST HAS YET
TO BE DETERMINED.

00:17.410 --> 00:19.412
AGENT LEWIS,
YOU WILL ALSO BE REASSIGNED.

00:19.450 --> 00:21.418
AGENT REID, YOU WILL BE
A FULL-TIME PROFESSOR

00:21.450 --> 00:23.179
WITH OUR EXCHANGE PROGRAM.

00:23.220 --> 00:25.381
AGENT ROSSI, THE FBI DEEPLY
APPRECIATES YOUR SERVICE,

00:25.420 --> 00:28.389
AND THE DIRECTOR WISHES YOU
NOTHING BUT THE BEST
IN YOUR RETIREMENT.

00:28.420 --> 00:32.356
AGENT SIMMONS, AGENT ALVEZ,
YOU WILL REMAIN HERE
AT THE BAU.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.288
GARCIA, IT FEELS LIKE
A FRESH START

00:34.330 --> 00:36.389
IN A DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT
WOULD BE BEST.

00:36.430 --> 00:38.091
I'M FIRED, AREN'T I?

00:38.130 --> 00:39.529
YOU'RE THE CONDITIONAL
UNIT CHIEF OF THE BAU.

00:39.570 --> 00:41.231
CONGRATULATIONS.

00:41.270 --> 00:42.464
THIS CAN'T BE THE END.

00:43.710 --> 00:46.304
CAN IT?

01:04.530 --> 01:08.523
YOU DESERVE EVERYTHING
YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET.

01:14.470 --> 01:15.459
FBI!

01:15.500 --> 01:17.263
FBI?

01:17.310 --> 01:21.474
YOUR CLIENT IS AGENT
DOUGLAS RUDY.

01:21.510 --> 01:24.445
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, DOUGIE BOY?

01:24.480 --> 01:27.449
UH, HEY, YOU GOT THE KEY
TO THESE THINGS SOMEWHERE?

01:27.480 --> 01:28.549
YOU SET ME UP?

01:28.580 --> 01:30.184
NO, I SWEAR!

01:30.220 --> 01:32.313
ODENKIRK: NO, HE DIDN'T
SET YOU UP, SWEETHEART.

01:32.360 --> 01:34.157
WE'RE OPR.

01:34.190 --> 01:35.452
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

01:35.490 --> 01:38.323
THE FBI VERSION
OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS.

01:38.360 --> 01:40.555
NOW, WE GOT WIND
THAT DOUG HERE

01:40.600 --> 01:41.555
HAD AN AFFINITY
FOR HOOKERS--

01:41.600 --> 01:43.397
NO OFFENSE.

01:43.430 --> 01:44.522
YOU'RE BOTH UNDER ARREST.

01:44.570 --> 01:46.197
PUT YOUR PANTS ON,
AGENT RUDY.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.561
RUDY: COME ON. I CAN'T
HELP IT WHAT TURNS ME ON,

01:48.600 --> 01:51.467
AND MY WIFE, SHE ISN'T
INTO THIS KIND OF THING.

01:51.510 --> 01:53.171
ODENKIRK:
WELL, SOMEHOW
I DON'T THINK

01:53.210 --> 01:54.199
YOUR WIFE'S GONNA
HAVE ANY TROUBLE

01:54.240 --> 01:56.504
WANTING TO BEAT
THE CRAP OUT OF
YOU AFI'ER TODAY.

01:56.550 --> 01:58.609
HA! THERE YOU GO.

01:58.650 --> 02:01.244
SEE, LOOK AT THAT.
WE CUFF YOU UP
FOR FREE.

02:01.280 --> 02:02.542
OFFICER:
LET'S GO.

02:02.590 --> 02:03.648
OFFICER:
LET'S GO.

02:03.690 --> 02:05.282
COME ON.

02:05.320 --> 02:06.412
I SHOULD'VE
TOOK SOME PICTURES

02:06.460 --> 02:08.758
FOR THE GUYS
BACK AT THE OFFICE.

02:08.790 --> 02:10.326
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO
KICK IT IN.

02:10.360 --> 02:11.520
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

02:11.560 --> 02:12.697
I THINK THAT'S
PRETI'Y IMPRESSIVE

02:12.730 --> 02:14.721
FOR A MAN MY AGE,
DON'T YOU THINK?

02:14.760 --> 02:16.466
OHH...

02:16.500 --> 02:19.469
THE MANAGER
GAVE US THE KEY.

02:19.500 --> 02:21.559
SO NOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO REIMBURSE THE MOTEL

02:21.600 --> 02:22.339
FOR THAT DAMAGE.

02:22.370 --> 02:24.429
RELAX, PRENTISS.
FOR A ROGUE AGENT,

02:24.470 --> 02:25.630
YOU'RE PRETI'Y UPTIGHT.

02:25.670 --> 02:27.376
WHERE DID YOU HEAR THAT?

02:27.410 --> 02:29.275
MIGHT HAVE BEEN
A LITTLE SOMETHING I SAW

02:29.310 --> 02:30.675
WHEN I TOOK A LOOK
IN YOUR FILE.

02:30.710 --> 02:32.268
YOU WHAT?!

02:32.320 --> 02:34.538
YOU MUST HAVE REALLY
PISSED OFF A.D. BARNES.

02:34.580 --> 02:37.219
TO GET BUSTED
FROM BAU CHIEF

02:37.250 --> 02:40.515
ALL THE WAY DOWN
TO RANK-AND-FILE OPR.

02:40.560 --> 02:43.154
REST OF YOUR TEAM
GET THE SHAFT, TOO?

02:51.230 --> 02:53.539
HEY. IS NED HERE YET?

02:53.570 --> 02:56.266
OH,
YOU MEAN LAZY NED,
THE ANTI

02:56.310 --> 02:58.528
HE USUALLY ROLLS IN
AROUND 11:00.

02:58.570 --> 03:00.231
YOU WANT TO WAIT
FOR HIM?

03:00.280 --> 03:01.702
NO. BARNES IS GIVING US
A HALF AN HOUR,

03:01.740 --> 03:03.276
AND WE'RE GONNA NEED
EVERY MINUTE OF IT

03:03.310 --> 03:04.538
TO TRY AND SELL HER
ON ONE OF THESE CASES.

03:04.580 --> 03:06.673
SO...

03:06.720 --> 03:08.517
IT'S BEEN TWO WEEKS
SINCE SHE TOOK OVER.

03:08.550 --> 03:10.438
SHE CAN'T KEEP US
ON THE BENCH MUCH LONGER.

03:10.490 --> 03:11.741
LET'S HOPE NOT.

03:11.790 --> 03:14.452
JJ: TWO MALE UNSUBS
HAVE ROBBED 4 BANKS.

03:14.490 --> 03:17.482
IN ADDITION TO GETTING AWAY WITH
NEARLY HALF A MILLION DOLLARS,

03:17.530 --> 03:20.419
THEY HAVE LEFI' TWO
BANK EMPLOYEES DEAD. WE--

03:20.460 --> 03:24.567
BARNES:
I DON'T KNOW. BANK ROBBERS
KILLING BANKERS?

03:24.600 --> 03:27.364
LET'S LOOK AT THIS
FROM THE POV
OF THE MEDIA COVERAGE.

03:27.400 --> 03:29.334
WHO'S THE EMOTIONAL VICTIM?

03:29.370 --> 03:31.361
HONESTLY, HALF OF THE COUNTRY

03:31.410 --> 03:32.672
IS GOING TO BE ROOTING
FOR THE UNSUBS.

03:32.710 --> 03:34.575
WHAT ELSE DO YOU HAVE?

03:34.610 --> 03:36.339
WE THINK THERE'S
AN ANGEL OF DEATH

03:36.380 --> 03:37.699
WORKING IN SOUTHERN
CALIFORNIA.

03:37.750 --> 03:40.548
THE UNSUB IS TARGETING
ELDERLY IMMIGRANTS
THAT LIVE IN NURSING HOMES.

03:40.580 --> 03:42.445
IMMIGRANTS.

03:42.490 --> 03:43.514
THAT'S DIVISIVE.

03:43.550 --> 03:46.417
WE NEED CASES
THAT UNITE THE PUBLIC.

03:46.460 --> 03:48.018
I CAN ALREADY HEAR PEOPLE
ASKING WHY THEY SHOULD CARE

03:48.060 --> 03:50.449
ABOUT A DEAD MEXICAN GRANDMA.

03:50.490 --> 03:53.493
ANYONE WITH ELDERLY
LOVED ONES SHOULD CARE.

03:53.530 --> 03:55.452
THE BAU IS AN ELITE UNIT.

03:55.500 --> 03:57.388
YOUR CASES SHOULD PLAY
THAT WAY IN THE MEDIA.

03:57.430 --> 04:00.263
26.

04:00.300 --> 04:01.460
I BEG YOUR PARDON.

04:01.500 --> 04:03.832
THAT IS THE NUMBER
OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIED

04:03.870 --> 04:05.701
SINCE YOU'VE SIDELINED
THE BAU.

04:05.740 --> 04:10.473
PEOPLE DIE WHEN WE
DON'T DO OUR JOB. YOU--

04:10.510 --> 04:13.274
YOU NEED TO LET US
DO OUR JOB.

04:13.320 --> 04:17.347
YOUR JOB IS TO MAKE
THE FBI LOOK GOOD

04:17.390 --> 04:18.584
FOR THE PUBLIC.

04:18.620 --> 04:20.588
IF YOU WOULD BRING ME
AN APPROPRIATE CASE,

04:20.620 --> 04:24.351
I WOULD GREENLIGHT
THE INVESTIGATION.

04:24.390 --> 04:25.584
OK.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.690
HUH!

04:32.940 --> 04:35.568
NED, WHERE THE HELL
HAVE YOU BEEN?

04:35.600 --> 04:38.364
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO DO A DEEP DIVE
ON VICTIMOLOGY.

04:38.410 --> 04:42.346
I DID. I MADE A VICTIM LIST
FOR EACH SEPARATE CASE

04:42.380 --> 04:44.769
WITH NAMES, DOBS,
LAST KNOWN ADDRESSES,

04:44.810 --> 04:46.516
EMPLOYMENT, TOO.

04:46.550 --> 04:49.519
THAT'S YOUR IDEA
OF A DEEP DIVE?

04:49.550 --> 04:51.484
YOU WANTED MORE?

04:51.520 --> 04:53.715
I--YEAH, I WANTED MORE.

04:53.760 --> 04:56.388
YOU KNOW WHAT?
MAYBE, UH,

04:56.430 --> 04:57.829
I CAN SUPERVISE
YOUR DEEP DIVES

04:57.860 --> 05:00.556
JUST UNTIL YOU
GET INTO A GROOVE.

05:00.600 --> 05:01.624
AWESOME.

05:01.660 --> 05:04.527
YOU KNOW, I COULD
JUST GIVE YOU GUYS

05:04.570 --> 05:06.390
ALL MY PASSWORDS
FOR THE DATABASES.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.431
THAT WAY YOU CAN
DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH

05:08.470 --> 05:09.903
AND CUSTOMIZE IT
TO WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

05:09.940 --> 05:11.532
SIMMONS: WE'LL THINK ABOUT THAT.

05:11.570 --> 05:14.368
JUST GIVE US A MINUTE
HERE, NED.

05:16.650 --> 05:17.878
JJ: OHH...

05:17.910 --> 05:19.878
OHH...

05:19.920 --> 05:23.686
OK. YOU KNOW,
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
SNAPPED AT HIM, REALLY.

05:23.720 --> 05:25.540
IT'S NOT HIS FAULT
HE'S NOT GARCIA.

05:25.590 --> 05:29.424
NO. THE LAZY PART,
THAT'S PRE'ITY MUCH
ALL ON HIM.

05:29.460 --> 05:31.451
YOU THINK GARCIA KNOWS
HOW MUCH WE MISS HER?

05:31.490 --> 05:33.549
I HOPE SO.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.524
WONDER HOW SHE'S DOING
OVER AT CYBER CRIMES.

05:38.900 --> 05:40.868
WELL, YOU GUYS,
IT'S HAPPENING.

05:40.900 --> 05:44.108
I AM MOVING IN FINALLY.

05:44.140 --> 05:45.801
I KNOW.
IT HAS TAKEN ME A WHILE,

05:45.840 --> 05:49.844
BUT I'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH
ALL 5 STAGES OF GRIEF.

05:49.880 --> 05:52.371
SOMETIMES I'M STILL THERE,
YOU KNOW? I'M PINBALLING.

05:52.420 --> 05:55.810
BARGAINING AGAIN AND THEN
DENIAL AND ANGER AND--

05:55.850 --> 05:58.489
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S NOT LINEAR.

05:58.520 --> 06:00.715
YOU GUYS GET ME.

06:00.760 --> 06:02.648
YOU GET ME.

06:02.690 --> 06:03.884
EXCUSE ME?

06:03.930 --> 06:07.889
I THINK THE BOSS
WANTS TO TALK TO YOU.

06:10.100 --> 06:12.660
THANK YOU.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.830
SE'I'I'LING IN OK?
EVERYTHING GOOD?

06:18.870 --> 06:21.805
OH. WELL,
IN FULL TRANSPARENCY,

06:21.840 --> 06:23.842
I--I GUESS GOOD IS
A GROSS OVERSTATEMENT,

06:23.880 --> 06:25.472
BUT I THINK GOOD
IS A GOAL,

06:25.510 --> 06:27.046
AND WITH A LITTLE TIME
AND A LOT OF HARD WORK,

06:27.080 --> 06:30.015
I THINK I CAN UP LEVEL TO--

06:30.050 --> 06:31.779
I'M WORKING REALLY HARD.

06:31.820 --> 06:33.515
LOOK, I GOT MYSELF
A WHOLE NEW WARDROBE.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.084
THIS IS SO NOT ME.

06:35.120 --> 06:38.180
YOU GOTTA GET RID
OF ALL THAT JUNK
ON YOUR DESK.

06:38.230 --> 06:39.959
WHAT?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.888
OH, NO, THAT'S NOT JUNK.

06:41.930 --> 06:43.124
3 PERSONAL ITEMS.

06:43.170 --> 06:45.195
YOU HAVE A POLICY
ABOUT HOW MANY ITEMS

06:45.230 --> 06:46.766
WE CAN HAVE ON OUR DESK?

06:46.800 --> 06:48.768
WE DO. AND IT APPLIES
TO EVERYONE,

06:48.800 --> 06:50.939
INCLUDING TRANSFERS
FROM THE BAU.

06:50.970 --> 06:52.870
PICK 3, THEN
GET BACK TO WORK.

06:52.910 --> 06:53.934
I JUST SENT YOU
A NEW CASE.

06:53.980 --> 06:55.777
THE DEFENDANT,
ADAM JEFFRIES,

06:55.810 --> 06:57.949
WAS ARRESTED AND CHARGED
WITH 53 COUNTS

06:57.980 --> 06:59.470
OF IDENTITY THEFT.

06:59.520 --> 07:00.942
ALL OF HIS HARD DRIVES
WERE SEIZED.

07:00.980 --> 07:02.117
I WANT YOU
TO GO THROUGH THEM

07:02.150 --> 07:03.811
AND PULL ANY EVIDENCE
THAT MAY SUPPORT

07:03.850 --> 07:05.886
THE IDENTITY THEFT CHARGES.

07:05.920 --> 07:07.785
OK.

07:11.990 --> 07:13.821
CAN I ASK A QUESTION?

07:13.860 --> 07:14.849
WHAT IS IT?

07:14.900 --> 07:16.822
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CASE
THAT I CLOSED YESTERDAY?

07:16.870 --> 07:19.088
THE SUSPECTS YOU IDENTIFIED
ARE ALL RUSSIAN NATIONALS

07:19.130 --> 07:20.836
LIVING IN RUSSIA.
THE UNITED STATES

07:20.870 --> 07:22.098
DOESN'T HAVE AN EXTRADITION
TREATY WITH RUSSIA.

07:22.140 --> 07:23.835
SO THEY JUST
GET AWAY WITH IT?

07:23.870 --> 07:25.030
NO. YOU SHUT DOWN
THEIR OPERATION.

07:25.070 --> 07:26.230
THEY COULD JUST
START ANOTHER ONE.

07:26.270 --> 07:28.204
THAT'S WHY WE
HAVE TO BE VIGILANT.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.845
WAIT, SO THIS WHOLE PLACE
IS LIKE A GIANT GAME
OF WHACK-A-MOLE--

07:30.880 --> 07:33.849
THE GAME WHERE THEY HAVE
THE MOLE, BUT IT'S
A CASE, NOT A MOLE?

07:33.880 --> 07:35.848
IS THAT--

07:35.880 --> 07:37.984
GET BACK TO WORK.

07:48.960 --> 07:51.758
SORRY ABOUT YOUR STUFF.

07:51.800 --> 07:53.165
THANK YOU.

07:54.900 --> 07:57.539
I LIKE YOUR UNICORN.

07:57.570 --> 08:00.903
OH. HEH.
SHE IS PRETTY GREAT, HUH?

08:17.960 --> 08:19.951
THAT'S WEIRD.

08:26.900 --> 08:29.198
OH, THIS IS REALLY BAD.

08:31.940 --> 08:34.079
MAN: BEAUTIFUL.

08:36.180 --> 08:38.899
NOW, LIFT YOUR CHIN
A LITTLE.

09:06.240 --> 09:09.846
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
ABC STUDIOS, LLC AND CBS, INC.

09:17.690 --> 09:18.987
JJ: "DEATH IS
THE MOTHER OF BEAUTY,

09:19.020 --> 09:21.215
"HENCE FROM HER, ALONE,

09:21.260 --> 09:23.080
"SHALL COME FULFILLMENT
OF OUR DREAMS

09:23.130 --> 09:26.327
AND OUR DESIRES."

09:26.360 --> 09:28.328
WALLACE STEVENS.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.294
MAN: IT GETS OLD,
YOU KNOW?

09:30.330 --> 09:32.321
'CAUSE SHE NEVER TAKES ME
OR MY THEORIES SERIOUSLY.

09:32.370 --> 09:36.067
YOU HAVE TO
UNDERSTAND THAT HIS
SO-CALLED THEORIES

09:36.100 --> 09:38.330
ARE WAY
OUTSIDE THE BOX.

09:38.370 --> 09:39.906
FOR INSTANCE?

09:39.940 --> 09:42.204
HE BELIEVES
IN THE PARANORMAL.

09:42.240 --> 09:43.673
AND YET SHE'S RELIGIOUS, OK?

09:43.710 --> 09:46.201
WHAT DEMANDS MORE BLIND
FAITH THAN GOD?

09:46.250 --> 09:49.071
MY RELIGIOUS BELIEFS ARE
NONE OF YOUR DAMN BUSINESS.

09:49.120 --> 09:51.088
THAT MUST MAKE IT
DIFFICULT

09:51.120 --> 09:52.348
FOR BOTH OF YOU
TO DO YOUR JOBS.

09:52.390 --> 09:54.255
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

09:54.290 --> 09:57.088
OK. UH, HAVE EITHER
OF YOU CONSIDERED

09:57.130 --> 09:58.358
PUTTING IN A REQUEST
FOR A NEW PARTNER,

09:58.390 --> 09:59.948
BECAUSE I FEEL--

10:00.000 --> 10:01.228
I DON'T WANT
A NEW PARTNER.

10:01.260 --> 10:03.967
HE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.321
WHO KNEW
THERE WERE SO MANY

10:06.370 --> 10:08.395
DYSFUNCTIONAL PARTNERS
IN THE BUREAU?

10:08.440 --> 10:10.237
I'M LEARNING THE HARD WAY.

10:10.270 --> 10:13.171
I HAD 3 STAKEOUTS
WITH ODENKIRK LAST WEEK.

10:13.210 --> 10:15.098
I KNOW HOW MUCH
YOU LOVE THOSE.

10:15.140 --> 10:18.371
AND IT'S ONE THING TO BE
OUT IN THE FIELD WITH HIM,

10:18.410 --> 10:21.345
BUT SITTING WITH HIM
IN A CAR FOR HOURS ON END.

10:21.380 --> 10:25.111
HE SMELLS, LIKE DIRTY
TIGHTIE WHITIES

10:25.150 --> 10:26.913
DIPPED IN SWEAT.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.689
AGHH!

10:28.720 --> 10:30.426
BARNES REALLY KNEW
HOW TO PUNISH YOU.

10:30.460 --> 10:31.688
I MEAN, STICKING YOU
WITH HIM.

10:31.730 --> 10:33.288
A NOT-SO-SUBTLE REFERENCE

10:33.330 --> 10:34.354
TO WHAT HAPPENS TO
AGENTS WHO TRANSGRESS.

10:34.400 --> 10:38.120
AND THERE IS NO DIRT ON
BARNES IN THE OPR DATABASE.

10:38.170 --> 10:39.990
SHE IS SQUEAKY CLEAN.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.395
YOU PULLED HER FILE?

10:42.440 --> 10:46.433
I THOUGHT MAYBE
WE'D GET LUCKY.

10:46.470 --> 10:48.335
SO WHAT NOW?

10:48.380 --> 10:51.702
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT OUR NEXT MOVE IS.

10:51.750 --> 10:54.719
WELL, WE HAVE GOT
TO THINK OF SOMETHING.

10:54.750 --> 10:58.345
I DO NOT KNOW HOW MUCH
MORE OF THIS ASSIGNMENT
I CAN TAKE.

10:58.390 --> 11:00.984
UHH...

11:04.990 --> 11:06.127
WHAT AM I LOOKING AT?

11:06.160 --> 11:08.128
GARCIA:
I FOUND THESE
IN A DROP BOX FILE

11:08.160 --> 11:10.424
ON A HARD DRIVE BELONGING
TO ADAM JEFFRIES.

11:10.470 --> 11:12.358
WHAT DO THESE HAVE
TO DO WITH OUR CASE?

11:12.400 --> 11:14.129
NOTHING.

11:14.170 --> 11:16.229
THEN WHY AM I
LOOKING AT THEM?

11:16.270 --> 11:18.135
YOU SEE THAT THOSE 3 PHOTOS
ARE OF THE SAME WOMAN, YES?

11:18.170 --> 11:19.398
YEAH.

11:19.440 --> 11:21.408
OK. WELL, THE DIGITAL
FILES HAD TIME STAMPS.

11:21.440 --> 11:23.374
THOSE 3 PHOTOS
WERE TAKEN LAST WEEK

11:23.410 --> 11:25.241
WITHIN A 72-HOUR PERIOD.

11:25.280 --> 11:26.372
AND THIS PHOTO
OF A DIFFERENT WOMAN--

11:26.410 --> 11:28.378
THAT WAS TAKEN
TWO DAYS AGO.

11:28.420 --> 11:30.115
AND?

11:30.150 --> 11:32.118
DON'T YOU SEE?

11:32.150 --> 11:33.378
LOOK.

11:37.060 --> 11:38.482
UH...SORRY.

11:38.530 --> 11:40.350
HE TAKES A CANDID PHOTO
OF A WOMAN

11:40.400 --> 11:41.992
OUT IN THE WORLD--

11:42.030 --> 11:44.123
HAPPY, HEALTHY,
UNSUSPECTING.

11:44.170 --> 11:47.139
HE THEN ABDUCTS HER,
HE PUTS HER INTO CAPTIVITY

11:47.170 --> 11:48.364
FOR 3 DAYS,
DURING WHICH TIME

11:48.400 --> 11:51.130
HE TAKES ANOTHER PICTURE
OF HER IN CAPTIVITY,

11:51.170 --> 11:53.377
THEN HE KILLS HER
AND TAKES A THIRD PICTURE

11:53.410 --> 11:56.777
WHEN SHE'S...DEAD.

11:56.810 --> 12:00.371
SO, THEN, YOU KNOW WHAT
THIS PHOTO MEANS, YES?

12:00.420 --> 12:03.184
WHAT DO YOU THINK
IT MEANS?

12:03.220 --> 12:05.381
I THINK IT MEANS THAT SHE'S
OUR UNSUB'S NEXT VICTIM.

12:05.420 --> 12:08.389
AND YOU BELIEVE
TH ESE ARE REAL?

12:08.420 --> 12:09.819
YOU DON'T?

12:09.860 --> 12:11.225
THE VIOLENCE LOOKS
PHOTO-SHOPPED.

12:11.260 --> 12:12.420
AND THE WOMEN,
THEY AREN'T UNDERAGE.

12:12.460 --> 12:15.497
SO WHAT YOU FOUND
ON THAT HARD DRIVE
IS NOT A CYBER CRIME.

12:15.530 --> 12:17.122
WE CAN'T IGNORE THIS.

12:17.170 --> 12:19.297
LOOK, IF YOU FEEL
STRONGLY ABOUT IT,

12:19.330 --> 12:21.139
MAYBE YOU CAN REFER IT
TO ANOTHER UNIT.

12:21.170 --> 12:24.401
MAYBE IT'S THE KIND OF THING
THE BAU IS HANDLING THESE DAYS.

12:28.810 --> 12:30.141
NO.

12:30.180 --> 12:32.148
WHY?

12:32.180 --> 12:33.374
THESE PHOTOS ARE FAKE.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.149
LOOK AT THE ONE
WITH THE COFFIN.

12:35.180 --> 12:36.374
THE BACKGROUND'S
SOME KIND OF PAINTING.

12:36.420 --> 12:38.115
IT'S PROFESSIONALLY LIT.

12:38.150 --> 12:39.287
THIS WOMEN AREN'T MISSING.

12:39.320 --> 12:42.153
THEY'RE MAKING A LIVING
POSING FOR CREEPY
FETISH PHOTOS.

12:42.190 --> 12:44.488
WELL, I THINK THAT'S WHAT
IT'S SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE.

12:44.530 --> 12:48.057
IF IT LOOKS LIKE A DUCK,
QUACKS LIKE A DUCK...

12:48.100 --> 12:49.522
OK.

12:51.330 --> 12:54.128
THAT VEIN IN HER NECK,
IT'S PURPLE.

12:54.170 --> 12:55.398
THAT'S DEOXYGENATED BLOOD.

12:55.440 --> 12:58.409
THAT SLIGHT DISCOLORATION
IN HER EARLOBE,

12:58.440 --> 12:59.532
THAT'S LIVIDITY.

12:59.570 --> 13:01.470
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT SELLS.

13:01.510 --> 13:03.444
OK, YOU KNOW, WE CAN
GO BACK AND FORTH

13:03.480 --> 13:08.144
ON THIS DEATH PHOTO ALL DAY,
BUT NOT THIS ONE.

13:08.180 --> 13:11.411
YOU SEE THAT LOOK
IN HER EYE? THAT'S TRAUMA.

13:11.450 --> 13:13.156
AND I HAVE SEEN IT
OFTEN ENOUGH

13:13.190 --> 13:15.408
TO KNOW WHEN IT'S FAKE
AND WHEN IT'S AUTHENTIC.

13:15.460 --> 13:17.428
THAT IS REAL.

13:17.460 --> 13:19.189
I DISAGREE.

13:21.560 --> 13:23.824
WELL, IF YOU ARE WRONG,

13:23.870 --> 13:26.430
THIS WOMAN,
SHE'D BE NUMBER 27.

13:26.470 --> 13:30.133
IF SHE DIES, HER BLOOD
IS ON YOUR HANDS.

13:30.170 --> 13:31.467
I'M COMFORTABLE
WITH THAT RISK.

13:55.600 --> 13:57.227
CALL ROSSI. I'LL CALL REID.

13:57.270 --> 13:58.362
ON IT.

14:00.270 --> 14:02.192
REID: OK, LET'S
TAKE A MOMENT NOW

14:02.240 --> 14:03.434
TO DISCUSS THE DIFFERENCE

14:03.470 --> 14:06.200
BETWEEN A TRIGGER
AND A STRESSOR.

14:06.240 --> 14:10.301
A TRIGGER IS A SENSORY EVENT
EXPERIENCED BY AN OFFENDER

14:10.350 --> 14:12.500
THAT PRECIPITATES
SUBSEQUENT BEHAVIOR,

14:12.550 --> 14:15.246
WHEREAS A STRESSOR
IS A LONGER-TERM

14:15.280 --> 14:17.646
PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR
OR CIRCUMSTANCES

14:17.690 --> 14:21.353
WHICH PUSH A PERSON INTO
BEHAVING DIFFERENTLY

14:21.390 --> 14:22.618
THAN THEY NORMALLY WOULD.

14:22.660 --> 14:24.878
YOU'RE PROBABLY GONNA
WANT TO WRITE THIS DOWN.

14:24.930 --> 14:26.386
I SHOULDN'T BE TELLING
YOU GUYS THIS,

14:26.430 --> 14:29.490
BUT I'M DEFINITELY
PUTTING THIS ON THE FINAL.

14:29.530 --> 14:31.896
I'M ONLY AUDITING
THIS CLASS.

14:31.930 --> 14:34.137
IS ANYONE ELSE
AUDITING THIS CLASS?

14:36.640 --> 14:40.201
OK.

14:40.240 --> 14:42.538
UNFORTUNATELY,
THAT IS ALL THE TIME
WE HAVE FOR TODAY.

14:42.580 --> 14:43.604
THANK YOU, GUYS.

14:48.480 --> 14:49.640
LUKE, HEY, WHAT'S UP?

14:56.490 --> 14:58.583
FREEZE, SCUMBAG!

15:00.230 --> 15:01.390
AND CUT!

15:01.430 --> 15:02.522
MAN: THAT WAS TERRIFIC.

15:02.560 --> 15:03.492
MAN:
PULL NEXT ONE!

15:03.530 --> 15:05.191
UM...

15:05.230 --> 15:06.390
HEY, YOU WANT TO
GO TALK TO HIM?

15:06.430 --> 15:08.193
UH, HEY, KID. UH...

15:08.240 --> 15:09.434
HOW'S IT GOING?
ALL GOOD.

15:09.470 --> 15:11.199
YEAH. LOOK,
I THOUGHT I'D GIVE YOU

15:11.240 --> 15:13.435
A FEW POINTERS ON HOW
TO HOLD YOUR FIREARM.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.471
MAY I

15:15.510 --> 15:18.399
UM, SEE, A HOLD LIKE THIS

15:18.450 --> 15:21.510
GIVES US MAXIMUM CONTROL,
WHICH IS WHAT WE WANT.

15:21.550 --> 15:23.438
WHEN YOU CANT IT THIS WAY,

15:23.490 --> 15:27.278
YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO HIT
AN INNOCENT BYSTANDER.

15:27.320 --> 15:30.687
GOT IT. MAN, LOVE WHEN
THE WRITER'S ON SET.

15:30.730 --> 15:32.027
THAN KS.

15:32.060 --> 15:33.459
OH, AND ONE--
ONE MORE THING.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.559
WHEN YOU DRAW DOWN
ON A SUSPECT,

15:35.600 --> 15:39.661
THE LINE IS,
"FBI. PUT YOUR HANDS UP,"

15:39.700 --> 15:44.205
NOT, UH, "FREEZE, SCUMBAG."

15:44.240 --> 15:46.435
YEAH. I JUST DIDN'T THINK
MY CHARACTER WOULD SAY

15:46.470 --> 15:49.701
THE "FBI, HANDS UP" THING.

15:49.740 --> 15:51.298
BUT HE DOES SAY THAT.

15:51.350 --> 15:53.045
IT'S, UH,
IT'S--IT'S RIGHT THERE.

15:53.080 --> 15:56.447
NO, IT JUST DIDN'T
FEEL ORGANIC.

15:56.480 --> 15:57.481
YOU KNOW?

15:57.520 --> 15:58.987
ORGANIC.

16:04.560 --> 16:07.222
ROSSI.

16:07.260 --> 16:11.993
OH, YES. PLEASE,
COUNT ME IN.

16:12.030 --> 16:13.497
CARRY ON.

16:16.500 --> 16:19.230
PRENTISS: THANK YOU,
ALL OF YOU, FOR COMING.

16:19.270 --> 16:20.771
I'VE MISSED THIS, US.

16:20.810 --> 16:22.471
BEFORE WE DO THIS,
I NEED TO BE SURE

16:22.510 --> 16:25.070
EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS
WHAT WE'RE GETTING INTO.

16:25.110 --> 16:28.614
WE HAVE BEEN TOLD
NOT TO INVESTIGATE THIS CASE.

16:28.650 --> 16:31.084
IF WE DO, WE ARE
VIOLATING DIRECT ORDERS,

16:31.120 --> 16:33.384
AND EVENTUALLY
BARNES WILL FIND OUT.

16:33.420 --> 16:35.479
SO, IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG

16:35.520 --> 16:37.351
OR WE DON'T CATCH
THIS UNSUB,

16:37.390 --> 16:41.349
SHE WILL SHUT DOWN THE BAU AND
MOST LIKELY FIRE ALL OF US.

16:41.400 --> 16:42.651
NO MORE REASSIGNMENTS.

16:42.700 --> 16:44.759
YOU KNOW WHAT? EVEN IF
EVERYTHING DOES GO RIGHT

16:44.800 --> 16:46.620
AND WE DO CATCH OUR UNSUB,

16:46.670 --> 16:48.558
I MEAN, THE SAME THING
COULD HAPPEN.

16:48.600 --> 16:50.500
SIMMONS:
RIGHT. BARNES WOULD TRY
TO SPIN IT, LABEL THE BAU

16:50.540 --> 16:52.508
A ROGUE UNIT THAT
NEEDS TO BE SHUT DOWN.

16:52.540 --> 16:54.098
RIGHT.

16:54.140 --> 16:55.778
SO IF ANYONE HAS DOUBTS,

16:55.810 --> 16:58.745
NO SHAME, NO JUDGMENT.

17:00.150 --> 17:04.610
THE BAU STARTED IN A ROOM
JUST LIKE THIS ONE.

17:04.650 --> 17:09.280
IF THIS IS HOW
IT GOES OUT, SO BE IT.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.555
WE'RE ALL IN?

17:13.560 --> 17:17.519
PRENTISS:
OK. LET'S TALK VICTIMOLOGY.

17:51.170 --> 17:53.730
* WAKE UP, DARLING

17:53.770 --> 17:57.501
THIS IS THE FUN PART.

17:57.540 --> 18:00.532
LET'S TAKE SOME PICTURES.

18:06.150 --> 18:07.572
NO!

18:13.490 --> 18:14.787
PRENTISS:
SINCE WE DON'T HAVE ANY LEADS
ON OUR VICTIMS' IDENTITIES,

18:14.820 --> 18:18.119
GARCIA'S BEEN DRILLING
DOWN ON THE E-MAILS

18:18.160 --> 18:19.229
THAT CONTAIN
THE PHOTO ATTACHMENTS.

18:19.260 --> 18:20.852
RIGHT, SO, THIS IS
THE DARKNET, SO
THEY'RE ENCRYPTED,

18:20.900 --> 18:22.788
BUT THE DIGITAL FILES
HAD TIME STAMPS.

18:22.830 --> 18:23.865
I WAS ABLE TO
NARROW DOWN
THEIR POINT OF ORIGIN

18:23.900 --> 18:25.822
TO THE GREATER
D.C. AREA.

18:25.870 --> 18:27.792
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO FOCUS OUR PROFILING

18:27.840 --> 18:29.296
ON THE PHOTOS.

18:29.340 --> 18:31.262
THE FIRST 3
ARE OF THE SAME WOMAN.

18:31.310 --> 18:33.835
THEY APPEAR TO BE
A COMPLETE 3-PART SERIES,

18:33.880 --> 18:35.836
DEPICTING HER
IN 3 DIFFERENT STATES--

18:35.880 --> 18:39.270
BEFORE, IN CAPTIVITY,
AND POSTMORTEM.

18:39.310 --> 18:41.278
THE BEFORE PICTURE
IS A CANDID PHOTO,

18:41.320 --> 18:44.585
WHICH SUGGESTS THE
WOMEN WERE COMFORTABLE
WITH THE UNSUB.

18:44.620 --> 18:45.609
ROSSI: WE HAVE ONLY ONE
CAPTIVITY PHOTO.

18:45.650 --> 18:47.652
IT WAS TAKEN
OVER 48 HOURS LATER.

18:47.690 --> 18:50.250
BUT IT'S IN A
DIFFERENT LOCATION.

18:50.290 --> 18:52.349
IT'S A DARKER,
ENCLOSED SPACE.

18:52.390 --> 18:54.858
THE VICTIM IS DISHEVELED
AND APPEARS DISORIENTED

18:54.900 --> 18:56.322
AND TRAUMATIZED.

18:56.360 --> 18:58.863
NOW SHE'S ONLY WEARING
THIS WHITE SATIN
NEGLIGEE.

18:58.900 --> 19:01.289
REID: THE THIRD PHOTO'S POSED
AND APPEARS TO BE POSTMORTEM.

19:01.340 --> 19:04.867
IN THIS CASE, THE FATAL WOUND,
A SINGLE BULLET TO THE CHEST,

19:04.910 --> 19:07.276
IS CLEARLY FEATURED.
IT'S ALSO BEEN
CLEANED UP A LITTLE BIT.

19:07.310 --> 19:10.347
THERE'S NO EXTRANEOUS BLOOD,
AND IT'S ALMOST PRETTY.

19:10.380 --> 19:12.848
PRENTISS:
SO HE'S DISPLAYING HIS WORK FOR
THOSE WHO WILL APPRECIATE IT,

19:12.880 --> 19:16.270
THE PEOPLE OUR DROP BOX OWNER
ADAM JEFFRIES WERE SELLING TO.

19:16.320 --> 19:17.844
JJ: OK, AND THEN THERE'S
THE FOURTH PHOTO,

19:17.890 --> 19:19.346
IT'S OF A DIFFERENT WOMAN.

19:19.390 --> 19:21.858
IT'S THE FIRST
IN A NEW SERIES,

19:21.890 --> 19:23.357
THE NEW VICTIM.

19:23.390 --> 19:26.223
THE FOURTH PHOTO
APPEARS TO BE TAKEN
72 HOURS AGO.

19:26.260 --> 19:28.399
IF THE UNSUB'S
PATTERN HOLDS,

19:28.430 --> 19:30.295
IT MEANS
SHE'S ABOUT TO DIE.

19:30.330 --> 19:34.198
JJ, LUKE, TARA,
DIG INTO THE BEFORE PHOTOS.

19:34.240 --> 19:36.390
GARCIA ALREADY RAN THEM
THROUGH THE BUREAU'S
HOTEL DATABASE.

19:36.440 --> 19:38.738
BASED ON BACKGROUND DETAILS,
IT'S EXTREMELY LIKELY

19:38.770 --> 19:41.307
THAT THEY WERE TAKEN AT
A HIGH-END HOTEL IN THE AREA.

19:41.340 --> 19:42.432
WE'LL MAP THEM OUT
AND START CANVASSING

19:42.480 --> 19:43.845
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.

19:43.880 --> 19:45.848
GOOD. DAVE, MATT,
HEAD OUT TO THE PRISON

19:45.880 --> 19:47.370
AND SEE WHAT ADAM JEFFRIES
CAN TELL YOU

19:47.420 --> 19:49.411
ABOUT HOW THESE ENDED UP
ON HIS DROP BOX.

19:49.450 --> 19:51.384
JEFFRIES:
THERE'S LOTS OF PEOPLE
THAT GET OFF ON EROTICA

19:51.420 --> 19:52.614
INVOLVING DEAD GIRLS.

19:52.650 --> 19:55.210
IT WAS A SIDE BUSINESS, REALLY.

19:55.260 --> 19:57.854
BUT THESE WERE HIGH QUALITY.

19:57.890 --> 20:00.324
OH, YEAH, REAL CLASSY.

20:00.360 --> 20:01.896
WHERE'D YOU GET
THE PHOTOS?

20:01.930 --> 20:03.625
THE ADDRESS WAS ENCRYPTED.

20:03.670 --> 20:05.365
SIMMONS: HOW'D YOU
HOOK UP WITH HIM?

20:05.400 --> 20:07.334
HE FOUND ME.
AND I DON'T ASK QUESTIONS.

20:07.370 --> 20:08.689
HOW DID YOU PAY
FOR THEM?

20:08.740 --> 20:09.991
THAT WAS THE BEST PART.

20:10.040 --> 20:12.361
HE DIDN'T WANT MONEY.
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

20:12.410 --> 20:13.479
HE'S JUST A DUDE
THAT THINKS PEOPLE

20:13.510 --> 20:15.432
SHOULD BE ALLOWED
TO GET OFF

20:15.480 --> 20:16.401
TO WHATEVER TURNS THEM ON,

20:16.440 --> 20:18.408
EVEN IF IT'S TABOO.

20:18.450 --> 20:19.439
LIKE AN ACT IVIST.

20:19.480 --> 20:21.368
REAL MAN
OF THE PEOPLE.

20:21.420 --> 20:23.012
YEAH.

20:23.050 --> 20:24.938
SO HOW DID IT WORK?

20:24.990 --> 20:26.981
WELL, HE SENT ME A BUNCH
OF PHOTOS OF ONE GIRL,

20:27.020 --> 20:28.681
WAY TOO MANY.

20:28.720 --> 20:30.881
BUT WHAT SELLS IS 3 PICTURES.

20:30.930 --> 20:33.353
BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.890
WHAT ABOUT THE PICTURES
YOU DIDN'T USE?

20:34.930 --> 20:37.364
YOU STILL HAVE THEM?

20:37.400 --> 20:39.459
I DON'T KNOW.

20:39.500 --> 20:40.797
MAYBE.

20:40.840 --> 20:41.966
WELL, WE'RE GONNA
NEED TO SEE THEM.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.729
YEAH?
YEAH.

20:43.770 --> 20:45.431
WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME?

20:45.470 --> 20:48.769
ROSSI: WELL, WHAT'S
IN IT FOR YOU IS THAT
WE DON'T CHARGE YOU

20:48.810 --> 20:51.370
AS AN ACCESSORY
AFTER THE FACT TO MURDER.

20:51.410 --> 20:53.810
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

20:53.850 --> 20:58.310
WELL, THESE PHOTOS
ARE REAL.

20:58.350 --> 21:01.353
THIS WOMAN IS DEAD.

21:01.390 --> 21:03.722
WHOA, WHOA--WHOA. HEY!

21:03.760 --> 21:05.352
I HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH THAT.

21:05.390 --> 21:07.392
ROSSI:
WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

21:07.430 --> 21:08.897
THEN IT WOULD SEEM
COOPERATING WITH US

21:08.930 --> 21:12.923
IS IN YOUR
BEST INTERESTS.

21:12.970 --> 21:15.291
YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE
A KID FROM THE BRONX

21:15.340 --> 21:16.364
IN PLACES LIKE THIS.

21:16.400 --> 21:19.062
YEAH. THERE WEREN'T
MANY 5-STAR HOTELS

21:19.110 --> 21:20.702
IN RURAL PENNSYLVANIA.

21:20.740 --> 21:22.071
I'VE BEEN IN MORE
OF THEM TODAY

21:22.110 --> 21:23.702
THAN I HAVE THE WHOLE
REST OF MY LIFE.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.843
CHECK THIS OUT.

21:26.980 --> 21:29.540
JJ, THAT'S A MATCH.

21:29.580 --> 21:31.389
IT'S THE SAME PAINTING.

21:31.420 --> 21:34.958
UH, LET'S SEE IF SOMEONE
CAN I.D. OUR VICTIMS.

21:37.860 --> 21:39.555
EXCUSE ME. HI.

21:39.590 --> 21:41.421
I WAS HOPING YOU COULD
HELP US WITH SOMETHING.

21:41.460 --> 21:43.462
OH. I'LL CERTAINLY
DO MY BEST.

21:43.500 --> 21:44.728
WE HAVE REASON
TO BELIEVE

21:44.770 --> 21:46.397
THESE PHOTOS
WERE TAKEN HERE.

21:46.430 --> 21:47.931
JJ: DO YOU RECOGNIZE EITHER
OF THESE YOUNG WOMEN?

21:47.970 --> 21:50.507
I'M VERY SORRY,
BUT I CAN'T COMMENT
ON OUR GUESTS.

21:50.540 --> 21:52.758
WE TAKE THEIR PRIVACY
VERY SERIOUSLY.

21:52.810 --> 21:54.004
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THAT,

21:54.040 --> 21:57.874
BUT, UH...I BELIEVE THIS
TRUMPS PRIVACY.

21:57.910 --> 21:59.969
INDEED IT DOES, SIR.

22:00.010 --> 22:01.341
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

22:01.380 --> 22:04.087
I DO RECOGNIZE
THESE YOUNG LADIES.

22:04.120 --> 22:06.543
THEY ARE BOTH FREQUENT
VISITORS TO THE HOTEL

22:06.590 --> 22:08.012
AND THEY ARE BOTH
ALWAYS HERE,

22:08.060 --> 22:09.459
WITH A DIFFERENT
MALE COMPANION,

22:09.490 --> 22:10.582
WHO PAYS CASH.

22:10.630 --> 22:12.029
DO YOU EVER RECOGNIZE

22:12.060 --> 22:13.391
ANY OF THE MALE COMPANIONS?

22:13.430 --> 22:14.954
NOT BY NAME,
BUT I KNOW THE TYPE.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.797
MONEY, POWER, STATUS.

22:16.830 --> 22:18.866
YOU, UH, YOU DON'T
HAVE SECURITY CAMERAS?

22:18.900 --> 22:21.596
NO. WE TAKE OUR GUESTS'
PRIVACY VERY SERIOUSLY.

22:21.640 --> 22:24.461
MANY OF OUR FREQUENT
PATRONS HAVE VERY
PUBLIC PROFILES.

22:24.510 --> 22:26.865
POLITICIANS.
AND I'M GUESSING

22:26.910 --> 22:29.572
THEY'RE NOT COMING HERE
WITH THEIR SPOUSES.

22:29.610 --> 22:32.374
WHEN WAS THE LAST
TIME YOU SAW EITHER
OF THESE WOMEN?

22:32.410 --> 22:34.776
MUST BE ABOUT A WEEK AGO.

22:36.180 --> 22:40.014
PRENTISS:
IT'S DARK. A GARAGE, MAYBE?

22:40.050 --> 22:41.881
BUT THE GROUND
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
POURED CONCRETE.

22:41.920 --> 22:44.081
COULD BE A BASEMENT
IN AN OLD BUILDING.

22:44.130 --> 22:47.349
WHAT IS SHE SITTING NEXT TO?
IS IT A CRATE?

22:52.930 --> 22:55.091
OR A WINE RACK.

22:55.140 --> 22:58.166
IT'S NOT JUST A BASEMENT.
I THINK IT'S A WINE CELLAR.

22:58.210 --> 23:00.098
THERE ARE A LOT OF
BIG OLD HOMES LIKE THIS

23:00.140 --> 23:03.507
IN AREAS LIKE CLARENDON,
KALORAMA, POTOMAC MANORS.

23:03.550 --> 23:05.404
I GREW UP IN A HOUSE
LIKE THIS.

23:05.450 --> 23:06.974
WELL,
IF THAT'S THE CASE,
THE UNSUB COULD BE

23:07.010 --> 23:09.877
A PERSON OF RESOURCES--
MONEY, MAYBE EVEN PRESTIGE.

23:23.600 --> 23:26.865
SO BEAUTIFUL.

23:57.230 --> 24:00.688
[EASY LISTENING
MUSIC PLAYING]

24:05.140 --> 24:07.108
GEORGE, SO GLAD
YOU COULD MAKE IT.

24:07.140 --> 24:09.131
GEORGE: THANK YOU
FOR THE INVITE.

24:14.620 --> 24:16.576
ELLEN, YOU LOOK AMAZING.

24:16.620 --> 24:19.088
ELLEN:
WHY, THANK YOU!

24:19.120 --> 24:22.510
AH. LOOKS LIKE YOU FOUND
SOMETHING TO KEEP YOU BUSY

24:22.560 --> 24:23.219
WHILE I WAS MINGLING.

24:23.260 --> 24:25.023
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING.

24:25.060 --> 24:26.254
IT TOOK YOU FOREVER.

24:26.290 --> 24:28.554
TRUST ME,
IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT.

24:28.600 --> 24:30.625
FOUND THE BOTTLE
I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT.

24:30.670 --> 24:33.093
SPECIAL RESERVE
CHATEAU ANJOU.

24:33.130 --> 24:34.267
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT.

24:34.300 --> 24:35.631
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE, KEV.

24:35.670 --> 24:38.230
FINE WINE IS WASTED
ON ME. YOU KNOW THAT.

24:38.270 --> 24:41.979
DON'T BE SILLY.

24:42.010 --> 24:43.568
I'VE MISSED YOU.

24:45.310 --> 24:48.518
8 YEARS IN EUROPE
WAS TOO LONG.

24:48.550 --> 24:51.212
YOU WERE ONLY 19
WHEN I LEFT

24:51.250 --> 24:52.979
AND A WILD CHILD.

24:53.020 --> 24:54.248
THE MORE THINGS
CHANGE...

24:56.320 --> 24:57.924
MAY I?

25:05.670 --> 25:07.297
BEAUTIFUL.

25:07.330 --> 25:09.969
I'LL SEND IT TO YOU.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.729
BY THE WAY,
HOW'S YOUR FATHER?

25:11.770 --> 25:13.306
HE'S BEEN MAKING NEWS
LATELY.

25:13.340 --> 25:17.276
YOU KNOW DADDY.
HE'S ALWAYS HAPPY
WHEN HE'S MAKING NEWS.

25:19.210 --> 25:24.580
RICH AND MYSTERIOUS
WITH A FABULOUS FINISH.

25:24.620 --> 25:27.509
REMINDS ME A LITTLE
OF YOU.

25:32.730 --> 25:34.550
GARCIA, EXCITEDLY:
OK. I HAVE NEWS.

25:34.600 --> 25:36.591
I HAVE--I HAVE
COPIOUS--COPIOUS NEWS.

25:36.630 --> 25:38.268
FIRST THE BACKSTORY.
THAT DROP BOX

25:38.300 --> 25:40.564
THAT I FIRST FOUND
THOSE 4 PHOTOS ON.

25:40.600 --> 25:42.659
I KEPT IT ACTIVE
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
MAYBE WE'D GET LUCKY.

25:42.700 --> 25:45.009
I ALSO FASHIONED IT WITH
EVERY TOOL AND TRAP I KNOW

25:45.040 --> 25:46.337
FOR CAPTURING IP ADDRESSES.

25:46.370 --> 25:48.008
SO DID WE GET LUCKY?

25:48.040 --> 25:51.009
NO. I MEAN YES, BUT, NO.

25:51.050 --> 25:54.042
UH, THERE'S BEEN
A NEW DROP OF PHOTOS.

25:54.080 --> 25:55.968
I JUST SENT
TO YOUR TABLETS NOW.

25:56.020 --> 25:58.648
THEY INCLUDE
A SERIES OF CAPTIVITY

25:58.690 --> 26:01.659
AND POSTMORTEM PHOTOS
OF OUR SECOND VICTIM.

26:01.690 --> 26:03.214
WE WERE TOO LATE.

26:03.260 --> 26:04.784
AND IT'S EVEN WORSE
THAN THAT.

26:04.830 --> 26:07.151
THERE'S A WHOLE NEW SERIES
OF PHOTOS OF A THIRD VICTIM

26:07.190 --> 26:09.294
WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT,
PLUS ONE NEW CANDID PHOTO.

26:09.330 --> 26:11.366
HE'S ALREADY GOT
HIS FOURTH VICTIM.

26:11.400 --> 26:13.220
DID YOU FIND
THE IP ADDRESS?

26:13.270 --> 26:14.999
NO. I'M SORRY.

26:15.040 --> 26:16.359
OK. ANY GOOD NEWS?

26:16.400 --> 26:19.005
NO. I MEAN--OK,
THIS MIGHT BE HELPFUL.

26:19.040 --> 26:21.338
I DID A SEARCH OF CASES
INVOLVING D.C.
HIGH-END HOTELS,

26:21.380 --> 26:24.372
AND I FOUND A BUNCH
OF ARTICLES REGARDING

26:24.410 --> 26:27.106
THE DEATH OF SOMEONE
NAMED TRACY FERGUSON.

26:27.150 --> 26:28.777
WAIT, I THINK I REMEMBER THAT.

26:28.820 --> 26:31.015
MM-HMM. YOU PROBABLY DO.
SHE WAS IN A BUNCH
OF HEADLINES,

26:31.050 --> 26:33.712
MOSTLY BECAUSE HER FATHER
WAS GEORGE FERGUSON,
THE D.C. POWER BROKER.

26:33.760 --> 26:37.389
ANYWAY, SHE WAS 27.
SHE WAS FOUND IN A SUITE
AT THE MONTCLAIR HOTEL,

26:37.420 --> 26:39.024
AND SHE WAS WEARING
A WHITE SATIN NEGLIGEE.

26:39.060 --> 26:41.028
LIKE THE ONE THE UNSUB
DRESSES HIS VICTIMS IN

26:41.060 --> 26:42.254
FOR THE CAPTIVITY PHOTOS.

26:42.300 --> 26:43.699
EXACTLY.

26:43.730 --> 26:44.867
OK, SO TRACY FERGUSON
COULD BE

26:44.900 --> 26:46.367
OUR UNSUB'S FIRST VICTIM.

26:46.400 --> 26:48.129
DID THEY INVESTIGATE?

26:48.170 --> 26:49.728
THEY DID.

26:49.770 --> 26:51.761
GOOD. WE NEED THOSE FILES.

26:51.810 --> 26:53.732
THAT'S WHERE IT GETS STICKY.

26:55.210 --> 26:56.734
THE CASE WAS SEALED
AT THE TIME.

26:56.780 --> 26:58.873
IN ORDER TO UNSEAL IT,
YOU NEED SPECIAL PERMISSION

26:58.910 --> 27:01.743
FROM THE LEAD
INVESTIGATING AGENT.

27:01.780 --> 27:03.884
THE D.C. FIELD AGENT
IN 2010

27:03.920 --> 27:05.285
WHO WAS IN CHARGE
OF THAT CASE

27:05.320 --> 27:07.049
WAS LINDA BARN ES.

27:20.370 --> 27:22.292
FROM ADAM JEFFRIES' DROP BOX.

27:22.340 --> 27:23.329
HOW MANY ARE WE
TALKING ABOUT?

27:23.370 --> 27:24.769
A LOT.

27:24.810 --> 27:27.233
THERE'S STILL ONLY
ONE CANDID PHOTO

27:27.270 --> 27:29.909
FOR EACH VICTIM,
BUT THERE ARE NEARLY 40

27:29.940 --> 27:32.272
CAPTIVITY AND DEATH PHOTOS.

27:37.180 --> 27:39.182
IS THERE A WAY
TO GET THE METADATA
FOR EACH OF THESE PHOTOS?

27:39.220 --> 27:42.155
IT FEELS LIKE THERE ARE FRAMES
MISSING FROM THE SEQUENCE.

27:46.230 --> 27:50.326
YOU'RE RIGHT.
THERE ARE MISSING FRAMES.

27:50.360 --> 27:51.827
UNSUB: YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL.

27:54.300 --> 27:56.461
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS!

27:56.500 --> 27:59.708
REID: HE'S KEEPING THE FRAMES
THAT CAPTURE THE MOMENT
OF MAXIMUM FEAR

27:59.740 --> 28:02.834
WHERE THE REALIZATION
OF DEATH IS IN THEIR EYES.

28:04.510 --> 28:06.842
UNSUB: SO BEAUTIFUL.

28:14.860 --> 28:16.816
REID: FOLLOWED BY
THE MOMENT RIGHT AFTER

28:16.860 --> 28:19.249
WHERE THE FEAR
AND THE LIFE LEAVE THEM.

28:21.330 --> 28:25.221
OK, SO WHY IS IT THAT MOMENT
THAT HE NEEDS TO RELIVE?

28:25.270 --> 28:27.226
WELL, IF TRACY FERGUSON
REALLY WAS HIS FIRST VICTIM,

28:27.270 --> 28:29.363
THEN SHE COULD BE THE KEY
TO ALL OF THIS.

28:29.400 --> 28:31.300
WE NEED TO SEE THAT FILE.

28:31.340 --> 28:32.830
IT MEANS TALKING
TO BARNES.

28:32.870 --> 28:34.872
ARE YOU READY
TO DO THAT?

28:41.280 --> 28:46.240
YOU LOOK SO MUCH LIKE TRACY.

28:47.990 --> 28:51.255
IT'S THE FIRST THING
I NOTICED ABOUT YOU WHEN WE MET.

28:53.860 --> 28:58.866
MAYHEW, YOU'RE NOT
LIKE HER AT ALL.

28:58.900 --> 29:00.265
YOU'RE SAFE WITH ME.

29:08.280 --> 29:11.772
LET'S TAKE SOME PICTURES.

29:12.280 --> 29:13.838
YOU WHAT?

29:13.880 --> 29:15.245
I KNOW HOW IT LOOKS.

29:15.280 --> 29:17.248
I KNOW WE VIOLATED
YOUR DIRECTIVE,

29:17.280 --> 29:20.852
BUT THE BAU SAVES LIVES.

29:20.890 --> 29:23.859
ISN'T--ISN'T THAT
WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT?

29:23.890 --> 29:25.858
ARE YOU REALLY
THAT ARROGANT?

29:25.890 --> 29:28.256
DO YOU TRULY BELIEVE
THAT THE BAU

29:28.300 --> 29:30.291
IS THE ONLY UNIT
IN THE FBI

29:30.330 --> 29:32.366
THAT'S IN IT
FOR THE GOOD GUYS?

29:32.400 --> 29:35.289
AGENT JAREAU,
WHAT DO YOU REALLY WANT?

29:35.340 --> 29:37.535
I NEED ACCESS TO A CASE
YOU INVESTIGATED

29:37.570 --> 29:41.279
AS A D.C. FIELD AGENT
IN 2010--TRACY FERGUSON.

29:41.310 --> 29:43.301
AND YOU SEALED HER FILE.

29:43.340 --> 29:46.503
LET ME GUESS.
YOU THINK IT WAS MURDER.

29:46.550 --> 29:48.939
I DO.

29:48.980 --> 29:52.279
I THINK TRACY WAS THIS
UNSUB'S FIRST VICTIM.

29:52.320 --> 29:54.379
YOU THINK THAT'S WHY
I SEALED THE FILE,

29:54.420 --> 29:55.557
BECAUSE I MISSED SOMETHING?

29:58.360 --> 30:01.329
ALL I KNOW IS THAT
I NEED TO SEE IT NOW.

30:01.360 --> 30:03.351
HER FATHER REPORTED HER
MISSING.

30:03.400 --> 30:05.322
THAT WASN'T UNUSUAL.
SHE WAS A JUNKIE.

30:05.370 --> 30:06.325
SHE WENT MISSING
ALL THE TIME.

30:06.370 --> 30:10.431
WE FOUND HER IN A SUITE
IN THE MONTCLAIR HOTEL.

30:10.470 --> 30:12.461
SHE'D CHECKED IN ABOUT
6 1/2 HOURS EARLIER,

30:12.510 --> 30:15.229
ALONG WITH 7 MEN,

30:15.280 --> 30:19.341
EACH OF WHOM
TOOK HIS TURN WITH HER

30:19.380 --> 30:21.871
IN EXCHANGE FOR HEROIN.

30:21.920 --> 30:24.809
THERE WERE NEEDLES
ALL OVER THE BED.

30:27.350 --> 30:31.081
SO THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED
TO TRACY FERGUSON.

30:31.130 --> 30:33.382
SHE ODed.

30:33.430 --> 30:35.557
HER FATHER CUT HER OFF
A COUPLE WEEKS EARLIER--

30:35.600 --> 30:38.592
TOUGH LOVE.

30:38.630 --> 30:41.861
SO SHE STARTED HAVING SEX
WITH MEN FOR DRUGS.

30:41.900 --> 30:44.903
SO YOU SEALED THE CASE
TO PROTECT HER FATHER?

30:44.940 --> 30:48.330
I DIDN'T SEE THE POINT
OF THE DETAILS
OF HIS CHILD'S DEATH

30:48.380 --> 30:51.349
BEING SPLASHED
ALL OVER THE TABLOIDS.

30:51.380 --> 30:54.178
GEORGE FERGUSON
WAS A GOOD MAN.

30:54.220 --> 30:55.175
I DIDN'T KNOW.

30:55.220 --> 30:56.539
AND SO WE ARE CLEAR,

30:56.580 --> 30:59.413
PERMISSION TO ACCESS
TRACY FERGUSON'S FILE

30:59.450 --> 31:01.589
IS OFFICIALLY DENIED.

31:01.620 --> 31:06.284
AND JUST SO WE ARE
CRYSTAL CLEAR,

31:06.330 --> 31:09.993
I AM RELIEVING YOU OF DUTY
EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY.

31:10.030 --> 31:14.899
PLEASE TURN OVER
YOUR GUN AND YOUR BADGE,
AGENT JAREAU.

31:29.550 --> 31:31.017
PRENTISS: JJ, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

31:31.050 --> 31:33.439
EMILY, HEY, UM,
SO I TALKED TO HER.

31:33.490 --> 31:36.379
SHE, UH, SHE KNOWS
I PUT THE BAU ON THE CASE.

31:36.420 --> 31:38.285
AND SHE FIRED ME.

31:38.330 --> 31:39.285
JJ, I'M SO SORRY.

31:39.330 --> 31:41.218
NO, EMILY, I'M FINE.

31:41.260 --> 31:42.249
I'M FINE.

31:42.300 --> 31:44.461
LOOK, SHE'S NOT GONNA GIVE US
ACCESS TO THE CASE,

31:44.500 --> 31:46.593
BUT I GOT SOMETHING.

31:46.630 --> 31:50.259
THERE WERE 7 OTHER PEOPLE
IN THAT HOTEL ROOM

31:50.300 --> 31:52.336
THE NIGHT TRACY DIED.

31:56.380 --> 31:57.938
HELLO. WHAT'S UP?

31:57.980 --> 31:59.072
WE'VE BEEN TRYING
TO GET AHOLD OF YOU

31:59.110 --> 32:00.475
FOR 20 MINUTES.
CAN YOU TALK?

32:00.510 --> 32:03.616
UH, I CAN SORT OF TALK.
DID JJ GET THE FILE?

32:03.650 --> 32:05.379
NO, BUT WE DON'T NEED
THE WHOLE FILE ANYMORE.

32:05.420 --> 32:07.012
ALL WE NEED ARE
THE CRIME SCENE PHOTOS.

32:07.050 --> 32:09.416
CAN YOU HACK JUST THE PHOTOS
WITHOUT RAISING FLAGS?

32:09.460 --> 32:11.519
YOU MEAN LIKE
A SURGICAL STRIKE?

32:11.560 --> 32:13.289
YEAH, GIVE ME A SECOND.

32:17.360 --> 32:20.488
OK. I'M IN.
WHAT AM I LOOKING FOR?

32:20.530 --> 32:22.532
WE'RE NOT SURE,
BUT THERE WERE 7 MEN

32:22.570 --> 32:24.606
IN THE ROOM WITH TRACY
ON THE NIGHT THAT SHE DIED.

32:24.640 --> 32:26.961
REID: AND WE'RE HOPING
SOMEBODY LEFT SOMETHING BEHIND.

32:27.010 --> 32:30.275
UH, LET'S SEE.
I SEE AN OPEN BOTTLE
OF WINE.

32:30.310 --> 32:32.369
UH, IT'S NOT JUST
ANY BOTTLE OF WINE.

32:32.410 --> 32:35.072
IT'S A BOTTLE OF
CHATEAU ANJOU FROM 1918.

32:35.120 --> 32:36.473
ROSSI: THAT'S
EXTREMELY RARE.

32:36.520 --> 32:38.283
WE SHOULD BE ABLE
TO TRACE THE SALE

32:38.320 --> 32:39.981
OF A BOTTLE LIKE THAT.

32:40.020 --> 32:42.511
CAN YOU RUN A SEARCH
TO SEE IF ONE
WAS SOLD AT AUCTION?

32:42.560 --> 32:44.118
ON IT.

32:44.160 --> 32:49.291
OH! I GOTTA--OH! I HAVE TO--
I HAVE TO CALL YOU BACK.

32:50.360 --> 32:51.429
UH, CHIEF?

32:51.470 --> 32:53.529
ANITA. WELL,
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

32:53.570 --> 32:56.664
I JUST WANTED TO UPDATE YOU
ON MY CROATIAN PHISHING CASE.

32:56.700 --> 32:59.066
ACTUALLY, NOT REALLY UPDATE,
MORE LIKE ASK A QUESTION.

32:59.110 --> 33:01.408
OR A FEW QUESTIONS.

33:01.440 --> 33:05.649
SURE. COME IN MY OFFICE.

33:12.590 --> 33:14.683
GUYS, CHECK THIS OUT.

33:14.720 --> 33:16.449
THERE IS A MISSING
PERSONS REPORT.

33:16.490 --> 33:18.026
HER NAME IS JESSICA MAYHEW.

33:18.060 --> 33:21.029
HER FATHER IS U.S. SENATOR
ALFRED MAYHEW.

33:21.060 --> 33:22.220
HE'S TALKING TO THE PRESS.

33:22.260 --> 33:24.160
REPORTER: WE'RE TAKING YOU LIVE
TO THE PRESS CONFERENCE NOW.

33:24.200 --> 33:25.724
MY DAUGHTER JESSICA

33:25.770 --> 33:28.091
IS A VICTIM
OF THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC

33:28.140 --> 33:29.596
THAT IS SWEEPING
OUR NATION.

33:29.640 --> 33:32.108
SHE'S BEEN MISSING
FOR OVER TWO DAYS NOW,

33:32.140 --> 33:34.404
AND I'M--I'M ASKING
FOR HELP IN FINDING HER.

33:36.180 --> 33:37.477
JJ: BARNES IS THERE

33:37.510 --> 33:38.670
TALKING TO THE SENATOR.

33:38.710 --> 33:40.109
OPTICS LIKE THIS
ARE RIGHT UP HER ALLEY.

33:40.150 --> 33:42.539
JESSICA MAYHEW IS OUR
UNSUB'S NEWEST VICTIM.

33:42.580 --> 33:44.445
SHE LOOKS A LOT
LIKE TRACY FERGUSON.

33:44.490 --> 33:47.379
AND LIKE TRACY,
SHE'S A HIGH-PROFILE
MEMBER OF THE D.C. ELITE.

33:47.420 --> 33:49.183
CALL GIRLS,
EVEN EXPENSIVE ONES,

33:49.220 --> 33:50.517
WEREN'T SATISFYING HIM
ANYMORE.

33:50.560 --> 33:52.050
HE NEEDED SOMEONE
WITH A PEDIGREE,

33:52.090 --> 33:54.524
SOMEONE MORE LIKE TRACY.

33:54.560 --> 33:57.358
GUYS, I--I FOUND
OUR CHATEAU ANJOU.

33:57.400 --> 34:00.369
IT WAS SOLD AT AUCTION
TO A KEVIN PECK.

34:00.400 --> 34:03.369
OH. KEVIN PECK IS
GEORGE FERGUSON'S STEPSON.

34:03.400 --> 34:05.163
PRENTISS: LET'S GO.
THAT'S OUR UNSUB.

34:05.210 --> 34:08.373
SENDING HIS LAST KNOWN
TO YOUR TABLETS.

34:14.220 --> 34:18.486
YOU'RE NOT LIKE HER
AT ALL, ARE YOU?

34:18.520 --> 34:21.683
SHE NEVER LET ME TOUCH HER.

34:21.720 --> 34:25.486
EVEN WHEN THOSE FILTHY
ANIMALS WERE ON TOP OF HER,

34:25.530 --> 34:28.658
SHE ONLY LET ME WATCH.

34:29.730 --> 34:33.120
I SAT RIGHT OVER THERE.

34:33.170 --> 34:37.129
I DRANK A GLASS OF WINE WHILE
THEY TOOK TURNS WITH HER.

34:37.170 --> 34:38.137
OHH...

34:38.170 --> 34:40.604
SHE WAS JUST BEING CRUEL.

34:40.640 --> 34:44.644
SHE KNEW HOW MUCH
I WANTED HER,

34:44.680 --> 34:47.501
AND ALL SHE DID
WAS LET ME WATCH.

34:50.150 --> 34:52.584
IT'S OK. I'VE GOT
A NICE BIG DOSE

34:52.620 --> 34:54.588
OF YOUR MEDICINE
RIGHT HERE.

34:54.620 --> 34:56.611
I CAN'T TAKE THAT MUCH.

34:58.560 --> 35:00.425
I KNOW.

35:09.170 --> 35:09.966
PRENTISS: PENELOPE,
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

35:10.000 --> 35:11.536
I'VE GOT SOME BACKGROUND
ON KEVIN PECK.

35:11.570 --> 35:13.208
LOOKS LIKE HIS PARENTS
WERE NEVER MARRIED,

35:13.240 --> 35:16.539
DAD WASN'T AROUND,
AND HIS MOM MARRIED
GEORGE FERGUSON

35:16.580 --> 35:17.831
WHEN KEVIN WAS 13.

35:17.880 --> 35:19.609
THE WASHINGTON
POWER BROKER.

35:19.650 --> 35:22.141
CORRECT. THE GOSSIP RAGS
WHERE NOT KIND.

35:22.180 --> 35:23.511
SHE WAS A FORMER STRIPPER.

35:23.550 --> 35:25.279
SO TRACY WAS HIS DAUGHTER
FROM HIS FIRST MARRIAGE.

35:25.320 --> 35:27.140
SHE WAS 19
WHEN HE REMARRIED.

35:27.190 --> 35:30.182
THAT WOULD MAKE TRACY
6 YEARS OLDER THAN KEVIN.

35:30.220 --> 35:31.653
HE COULD HAVE HAD
A CRUSH ON HER.

35:31.690 --> 35:32.827
GARCIA: I THINK IT WAS
MORE THAN THAT.

35:32.860 --> 35:34.157
HE WAS HEAD OVER
HEELS FOR HER.

35:34.200 --> 35:35.929
THERE'S ALL KINDS
OF PHOTOGRAPHS OF THEM

35:35.960 --> 35:38.667
FROM LIKE VARIOUS EVENTS
ALL OVER THE D.C. AREA.

35:40.500 --> 35:41.660
LOOK AT THAT BODY LANGUAGE.

35:41.700 --> 35:43.736
HE'S ALL OVER HER,
AND SHE'S PULLING AWAY.

35:43.770 --> 35:45.203
ACCORDING TO TRACY'S
MYSPACE PAGE,

35:45.240 --> 35:47.561
SHE WAS NOT FOND
OF HER STEPMOTHER.

35:47.610 --> 35:49.168
SHE REFERRED TO HER AS, QUOTE,

35:49.210 --> 35:52.543
"THE WHITE TRASH GOLD-DIGGER
WHO MOVED INTO MY HOUSE."

35:52.580 --> 35:53.877
WELL, IF THAT
WAS HER ATTITUDE

35:53.910 --> 35:55.468
AND HE WAS SMITTEN
WITH HER,

35:55.520 --> 35:57.772
HE MIGHT HAVE FELT
SHE WAS TOO GOOD FOR HIM.

35:57.820 --> 35:59.708
HER SUBSTANCE ABUSE
COULDN'T HAVE HELPED THINGS.

35:59.750 --> 36:03.186
THE DRUG USE SPIRALED
OUT OF CONTROL A FEW YEARS
INTO THE MARRIAGE.

36:03.220 --> 36:06.257
SO IF TRACY'S DRAMA ATE UP
THE WHOLE FAMILY'S ATTENTION,

36:06.290 --> 36:08.497
IT'S POSSIBLE KEVIN WENT
IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION,

36:08.530 --> 36:10.725
PLAYING THE ROLE
OF THE OBEDIENT CHILD.

36:10.760 --> 36:11.966
YEAH, THAT DOES MAKE SENSE.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.592
HIS STEPFATH ER WAS
QUITE FOND OF KEVIN.

36:13.630 --> 36:15.234
HE SET UP A TRUST FUND
FOR HIM

36:15.270 --> 36:17.192
THAT KEVIN HAD ACCESS TO
WHEN HE TURNED 18.

36:17.240 --> 36:19.504
I BET THAT CHANGED
HOW TRACY TREATED HIM.

36:19.540 --> 36:22.907
IT SEEMS TO HAVE.
ACCORDING TO BANK RECORDS,

36:22.940 --> 36:26.307
KEVIN WAS PUTTING
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS
INTO TRACY'S ACCOUNT.

36:26.350 --> 36:27.601
THAN KS, GARCIA.

36:30.280 --> 36:32.214
WE BETTER BE KICKING IN
THE RIGHT DOOR.

36:58.280 --> 36:59.872
SO WHERE DID HE TAKE HER?

36:59.910 --> 37:02.242
THE THIRD PHOTO
IN EVERY SERIES--

37:02.280 --> 37:06.319
IT WAS CRAFTED TO FULFILL
A BUYER'S NECROPHILIAC FANTASY.

37:06.350 --> 37:07.749
TRACY WAS KEVIN'S FANTASY.

37:07.790 --> 37:09.985
TRACY DIED IN A SUITE
AT THE MONTCLAIR HOTEL.

37:10.020 --> 37:12.580
THAT'S WHERE HE TOOK HER.

37:12.630 --> 37:14.825
TRACY...

37:14.860 --> 37:16.953
MY TRACY.

37:17.000 --> 37:20.265
I LOVED YOU SO MUCH.

37:21.770 --> 37:24.307
I WOULD HAVE
TAKEN CARE OF YOU.

37:34.350 --> 37:35.772
HANDS, HANDS,
SHOW ME YOUR HANDS!

37:35.820 --> 37:36.809
GET 'EM UP!

37:36.850 --> 37:37.976
STAY TH ERE.

37:38.020 --> 37:40.784
ALL RIGHT, UP, UP, UP.

37:40.820 --> 37:42.310
YOU'RE TOO LATE.

37:42.360 --> 37:44.954
TOO LATE. LOOK
HOW BEAUTIFUL SHE IS,

37:44.990 --> 37:46.628
MY TRACY.

37:46.660 --> 37:50.027
HEY. HEY.

37:50.060 --> 37:51.322
SHE'S GOT A PULSE.

37:51.370 --> 37:52.769
IT'S WEAK, BUT SHE'S ALIVE.

37:52.800 --> 37:53.869
COME ON!

37:53.900 --> 37:56.039
CALL AN AMBULANCE!

38:06.950 --> 38:09.009
IS SHE ALIVE?
IS SHE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT?

38:09.050 --> 38:11.780
SENATOR, SHE'S GOING
TO BE FINE.

38:11.820 --> 38:13.640
SIMMONS: HER ABDUCTOR
GAVE HER AN OVERDOSE,

38:13.690 --> 38:15.351
BUT SHE SHOULD BE
ALL RIGHT.

38:17.920 --> 38:20.024
YOU SAID THIS WAS
THE WORK OF THE BAU.

38:20.060 --> 38:21.459
IS THAT RIGHT?

38:21.500 --> 38:22.956
YES, SIR.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.319
THANK YOU.

38:24.370 --> 38:26.065
ALL OF YOU.

38:26.100 --> 38:28.068
YOU SAVED
MY DAUGHTER'S LIFE.

38:28.100 --> 38:30.034
IT WAS A TEAM EFFORT.

38:30.070 --> 38:31.765
GLAD WE WERE HERE.

38:31.810 --> 38:34.779
MAYHEW: SO AM I. LOOK,
I KNOW THERE'S BEEN TALK

38:34.810 --> 38:36.869
ABOUT SHUTTING DOWN
YOUR UNIT,

38:36.910 --> 38:39.003
SPREADING PROFILERS
OUT INTO
THE FIELD OFFICES.

38:39.050 --> 38:41.769
THAT'S JUST ONE OPTION
TO INCREASE EFFICIENCY.

38:41.820 --> 38:43.412
I THINK THAT'S A MISTAKE.

38:43.450 --> 38:44.678
UNDERSTOOD.

38:44.720 --> 38:45.880
WHEN I RETURN
TO THE SENATE,

38:45.920 --> 38:47.888
I WILL PERSONALLY
ENSURE

38:47.920 --> 38:50.912
THAT THE BAU IS
FUNDED AND STAFFED
TO FULL CAPACITY.

38:50.960 --> 38:52.780
BUT IN THE MEANTIME,
DON'T YOU THINK

38:52.830 --> 38:55.799
AGENT PRENTISS
SHOULD BE REINSTATED
AS UNIT CHIEF?

38:55.830 --> 38:58.469
CONSIDER IT DONE.

38:58.500 --> 39:00.968
SENATOR, DOES THIS MEAN
THAT I HAVE
HIRING AUTHORITY?

39:01.000 --> 39:01.989
WITHIN REASON.

39:02.040 --> 39:06.033
I'M ONLY ASKING BECAUSE
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR BARNES

39:06.070 --> 39:08.038
TERMINATED AGENT JAREAU
WHEN SHE ASKED QUESTIONS

39:08.070 --> 39:10.800
ABOUT THE TRACY FERGUSON CASE.

39:10.840 --> 39:14.105
THAT WAS THE CASE
THAT ALLOWED US
TO IDENTIFY THIS UNSUB.

39:21.890 --> 39:23.755
YOU HAVE FULL AUTHORITY.

39:23.790 --> 39:26.884
STAFF THE BAU
ANY WAY YOU SEE FIT.

39:26.930 --> 39:28.124
THANK YOU, SIR.

39:28.160 --> 39:30.799
LINDA, I'D LIKE
TO SEE YOU IN MY OFFICE

39:30.830 --> 39:32.718
FIRST THING TOMORROW.

39:37.440 --> 39:41.774
WOMAN: * WHEN YOU FEEL LIGHT

39:41.810 --> 39:46.702
* YOU FEEL TIRED

39:46.750 --> 39:49.810
* JUST TRY TO THINK OF ALL
THE LIVES YOUR CHANGING *

39:49.850 --> 39:51.909
YOU'RE LEAVING,
AREN'T YOU?

39:51.950 --> 39:55.078
YEAH. I'M GOING BACK
TO THE BAU.

39:55.120 --> 39:56.985
I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T
STAY HERE.

39:57.020 --> 39:58.829
I CAN'T. HEY, THANK YOU
FOR WHAT YOU DID,

39:58.860 --> 40:02.421
DISTRACTING OMRI
LIKE THAT.

40:02.460 --> 40:05.065
YOU WERE WORKING A CASE
FOR THE BAU, WEREN'T YOU?

40:05.100 --> 40:07.819
YEAH, I WAS.

40:07.870 --> 40:09.064
THAT LOOKED EXCITING.

40:09.100 --> 40:11.136
LIKE REAL CRIME-FIGHTING.

40:11.170 --> 40:12.831
YOU WERE PART OF THAT,
YOU KNOW.

40:12.870 --> 40:14.064
YOU WERE DISTRACTING HIM,

40:14.110 --> 40:16.078
AND I WAS GIVING
SUPER IMPORTANT INFORMATION

40:16.110 --> 40:17.839
TO AGENTS IN THE FIELD,

40:17.880 --> 40:20.075
AND THAT SAVED
A WOMAN'S LIFE.

40:20.110 --> 40:23.079
I DID THAT?

40:23.120 --> 40:26.840
WOW. I DID THAT.

40:26.890 --> 40:29.051
YEAH, YOU DID.

40:29.090 --> 40:30.079
* AND HOLD IT HIGHER

40:30.120 --> 40:32.179
I'M REALLY GONNA
MISS YOU.

40:32.230 --> 40:34.027
OHH...

40:34.060 --> 40:35.823
* SO THEY CAN SHOW YOU ALL
THE LIGHT YOU BROUGHT HERE *

40:35.860 --> 40:39.068
HEY. SOMETHING
TO REMEMBER ME BY.

40:39.100 --> 40:40.829
THANK YOU.

40:40.870 --> 40:44.829
* COMING H-O-O-O-O-O-O-OME

40:44.870 --> 40:47.100
* H-O-O-O-O-OME

40:50.180 --> 40:51.841
* WHEN YOU BELIEVE

40:51.880 --> 40:53.074
WHERE'S PRENTISS?

40:53.110 --> 40:54.509
TRANSFERRED.

40:55.880 --> 40:56.847
* AND WATCH YOU DREAM

40:56.880 --> 40:59.883
SHE SAID I MIGHT NEED THIS.

40:59.920 --> 41:05.187
* THEN ALL THE POSSIBILITIES
ARE ENDLESS *

41:05.230 --> 41:07.152
I DON'T THINK
SHE'S COMING.

41:07.190 --> 41:10.091
* SO TAKE THIS DREAM

41:10.130 --> 41:11.597
SO WE'VE GOT
A HALF-HOUR BEFORE

41:11.630 --> 41:13.120
WE NEED TO BE BACK?

41:13.170 --> 41:16.594
* AND HELP ME GROW

41:16.640 --> 41:21.031
* INTO THE HOPE THAT
YOU'VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR *

41:23.880 --> 41:26.849
* COMING HO-O-O-O-O-O...

41:26.880 --> 41:28.848
MAN: I DON'T CARE
WHAT HE SAYS!

41:28.880 --> 41:31.610
I REALLY DON'T THINK
THAT'S WHAT
MY CHARACTER WOULD DO.

41:31.650 --> 41:33.117
WHERE'S THE WRITER?

41:33.150 --> 41:35.152
MAN: UH, HE QUIT.

41:37.290 --> 41:38.848
ME, TOO.

41:38.890 --> 41:41.859
* H-O-O-O-O-O-O-OME

41:41.900 --> 41:43.993
WAS IT SOMETHING I DID?

41:44.030 --> 41:46.863
MOSTLY IT WAS
WHAT YOU DIDN'T DO.

41:48.200 --> 41:52.204
* TO YOUR ROOTS

41:52.240 --> 41:54.936
* WE'LL TAKE YOU
ON A JOURNEY *

41:54.980 --> 41:57.107
GARCIA: I COULDN'T
WAIT UNTIL MORNING!

41:57.140 --> 41:58.846
OH, YOU WEREN'T
THE ONLY ONE.

41:58.880 --> 42:00.040
REID: YOU LOOK GREAT.

42:00.080 --> 42:01.877
I FEEL GREAT.
YOU GUYS REALLY DID IT.

42:01.920 --> 42:03.842
LEWIS: OHH, I WISH I
COULD HAVE BEEN THERE

42:03.880 --> 42:05.211
TO SEE BARNES' FACE
WHEN THE SENATOR SHOWED UP.

42:05.250 --> 42:07.138
SIMMONS: I THOUGHT
SHE WAS GONNA MELT

42:07.190 --> 42:08.248
LIKE THE WICKED WITCH
OF THE WEST

42:08.290 --> 42:10.850
WHEN HE SAID PRENTISS
COULD HIRE
WHOEVER SHE WANTED.

42:10.890 --> 42:12.585
YOU THINK SHE'LL BACK OFF
FOR GOOD?

42:12.630 --> 42:14.325
THE DIRECTOR CALLED ME.

42:14.360 --> 42:16.089
HE SAID BARNES WAS TOLD

42:16.130 --> 42:18.860
TO KEEP HER HANDS OFF
THE BAU.

42:18.900 --> 42:22.131
ROSSI: AND SO, WE LIVE
TO FIGHT ANOTHER DAY.

42:22.170 --> 42:24.263
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
