WEBVTT

00:02.830 --> 00:04.594
- Previously...
- Travelling through time.

00:04.630 --> 00:07.759
- L'il Smokie? Please!
- (Women): Blood of the child!

00:07.800 --> 00:09.700
- No! What happened
to you in our house?

00:09.740 --> 00:11.435
She sang a message.

00:11.470 --> 00:12.801
I'm supposed
to help her.

00:12.840 --> 00:14.535
- How did you pull this off?

00:14.580 --> 00:16.571
Club? Getting the
vampires in line?

00:16.610 --> 00:19.318
- After the virus, there was
a big vacuum of leadership,

00:19.350 --> 00:21.239
and I stepped in.

00:21.280 --> 00:24.341
(Kenny): Oh! Who would even
try something like that?

00:24.390 --> 00:25.539
- It's me.

00:25.590 --> 00:26.785
- Suzanna?

00:26.820 --> 00:30.427
(Growling and snarling)

00:30.460 --> 00:32.519
- The wolf can come
out whenever it wants.

00:32.560 --> 00:36.098
I felt powerful.
I felt strong.

00:37.530 --> 00:40.329
- Can I get my espadrilles?

00:40.370 --> 00:42.737
- Yup!

00:42.770 --> 00:46.172
- And maybe hold off on turning
our room into a cross-fit studio

00:46.210 --> 00:47.371
until after I leave?

00:47.410 --> 00:50.300
- (Panting):
Yup! Perfect! Smart!

00:50.350 --> 00:52.614
- Remember what
we talked about, OK?

00:52.650 --> 00:54.539
Keep track of
any triggers today,

00:54.580 --> 00:57.242
anything that sets the wolf off.

00:57.290 --> 01:00.180
- I'm on it! And you don't
have to worry about things here.

01:00.220 --> 01:01.756
I got it. I even
made a to-do list.

01:01.790 --> 01:03.155
- Really?
- Yeah!

01:03.190 --> 01:05.522
- That's great!
- Yeah, it is great!

01:05.560 --> 01:08.120
Except I can't find
the to-do list, so...

01:08.160 --> 01:09.559
- (Sally):
Sorry to interrupt.

01:09.600 --> 01:12.194
I really am trying to
give you some private time,

01:12.240 --> 01:16.108
but if I'm gonna
help L'il Smokie,

01:16.140 --> 01:18.438
I just need to
figure out who she was.

01:18.470 --> 01:19.733
- How you gonna find her?

01:19.780 --> 01:23.546
- I was hoping to get
corporeal help from you!

01:23.580 --> 01:25.571
- I would,
but I'm working doubles!

01:25.610 --> 01:26.839
- Oh, really? Till when?

01:26.880 --> 01:29.679
- Until her husband
can hold down a job

01:29.720 --> 01:31.609
without attacking his boss.

01:31.650 --> 01:33.482
- Why doesn't Josh help you?

01:33.520 --> 01:36.729
- Well, no offense, Josh's
attention span and focus

01:36.760 --> 01:38.888
is like a dog in a
field of squirrels.

01:38.930 --> 01:40.853
- I resent that!
I can focus.

01:40.900 --> 01:43.164
I just need to get
in a quick 10 miles,

01:43.200 --> 01:44.497
and find my to-do list,

01:44.530 --> 01:45.895
which is somewhere.

01:45.930 --> 01:47.295
- Is this it?

01:47.340 --> 01:50.469
- Yes, that's it! Wow,
it was right there, huh?

01:50.510 --> 01:54.435
- "Do laundry, try chia seeds,
batteries, question mark."

01:54.480 --> 01:57.472
And then there's
a drawing of a pumpkin.

01:57.510 --> 01:59.649
- Yeah, that meant something.

01:59.680 --> 02:01.842
That meant something.

02:05.220 --> 02:07.154
(Sighing)

02:09.460 --> 02:11.656
(Laughing)

02:11.690 --> 02:14.557
- Oh, it is so much
better this way!

02:17.200 --> 02:18.725
- Which way?

02:18.770 --> 02:23.264
- Just not wondering anymore
what you're thinking,

02:23.310 --> 02:26.678
and if you're in this
for the long haul.

02:28.640 --> 02:30.347
- I told you that I was.

02:30.380 --> 02:35.580
- I know, but then
you went and proved it.

02:41.860 --> 02:43.350
(Kat moaning)

02:45.560 --> 02:47.426
(Both moaning)

02:47.460 --> 02:48.757
- Aidan!

02:50.770 --> 02:52.465
- Oh, come on! What the--

02:52.500 --> 02:54.332
- Listen, the woman
from the blood den?

02:54.370 --> 02:56.202
She dusted 10 more
of us last night.

02:56.240 --> 02:57.867
- I told you I don't
know who she is.

02:57.910 --> 02:59.571
- I know, but you
better find out.

02:59.610 --> 03:01.533
I think you're next.

03:01.580 --> 03:09.580
(Panting)

03:30.040 --> 03:33.670
- One of our funeral crews did
a morgue run to your hospital.

03:33.710 --> 03:35.337
They swear she was watching you.

03:35.380 --> 03:37.872
I sent guys down there
to end her, but she was gone.

03:37.910 --> 03:39.344
- Your concern is touching,

03:39.380 --> 03:41.314
but you don't need
to worry about me.

03:41.350 --> 03:42.988
- Somebody needs
to worry about you.

03:43.020 --> 03:44.510
All these surprise attacks.

03:44.550 --> 03:47.258
She's wants to make a statement!
- What's the statement?

03:47.290 --> 03:49.554
- What bigger statement
than coming after you!

03:49.590 --> 03:51.922
- Aidan freakin' Waite,
the last son of Bishop.

03:51.960 --> 03:54.691
And I'm not gonna
let her do that to you.

03:54.730 --> 03:57.665
- OK, all right,
I'll ask around again.

03:57.700 --> 03:59.338
- OK, thank you.

03:59.370 --> 04:01.532
Sorry, it's hard
to keep a morale up

04:01.570 --> 04:04.301
with this nut job
on the loose, you know?

04:05.710 --> 04:06.973
OK...

04:07.010 --> 04:08.774
- Wait! Stop!

04:08.810 --> 04:09.902
- What?

04:09.950 --> 04:11.975
- You're not going
out the window.

04:13.650 --> 04:15.869
- You want me to--
- Yes, come on!

04:15.920 --> 04:17.843
- OK...

04:19.990 --> 04:24.086
- Hey! There's no good way
to tell you this, so...

04:27.000 --> 04:30.823
- Oh my God!
What's he doing here?

04:30.870 --> 04:32.565
- What's he
doing anywhere?

04:32.600 --> 04:35.365
You looked me in the eye,
and you promised me, Aidan.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.437
- And you nearly
killed us all

04:37.470 --> 04:41.077
by unlocking your cage
and releasing your w--

04:41.110 --> 04:44.842
No, no, scratch that. You were
trying to get me to kill you!

04:44.880 --> 04:47.611
Oh, I guess that makes
perfect sense, right,

04:47.650 --> 04:49.641
because we're monsters,

04:49.690 --> 04:51.340
but there's gotta be room,

04:51.390 --> 04:53.552
there's gotta be
room for human error.

04:53.590 --> 04:54.716
Josh, I'm sorry.

04:54.760 --> 04:58.321
I messed up.
I didn't kill my son.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.519
I gave him a 2nd chance,

05:02.570 --> 05:06.495
and this is something that
we have all done for each other

05:06.540 --> 05:08.531
more times than I count.

05:08.570 --> 05:11.062
Nora, whatever he did to you,

05:11.110 --> 05:13.772
that's because
of what I made him.

05:15.780 --> 05:17.509
And it wasn't his fault.

05:17.550 --> 05:19.109
- And why is he here now?

05:19.150 --> 05:22.688
- To apologize. I'm really
sorry for what I did.

05:22.720 --> 05:23.983
You saw me at my worst.

05:24.020 --> 05:26.910
When I attacked you,
I wasn't thinking straight.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.780
I was out of control.

05:30.490 --> 05:31.525
- What?

05:33.030 --> 05:35.897
No, you're not remembering,
"cause you were unconscious,

05:35.930 --> 05:37.568
but I saw him!

05:37.600 --> 05:42.060
I know exactly what you-- I saw
him! He was trying to kill you!

05:42.100 --> 05:46.503
- Josh, I know, but
when you scratched me,

05:46.540 --> 05:48.679
you had no control
over yourself,

05:48.710 --> 05:50.144
You could've killed me.

05:50.180 --> 05:52.774
- Yeah, but I never
would. No way! I--

05:52.820 --> 05:55.869
- I know that! But we've
been there before, OK?

05:55.920 --> 05:57.945
The unpredictable
nature of what we are.

05:57.990 --> 05:59.048
We know what that is.

06:00.520 --> 06:02.887
He's gone through
the worst of it.

06:02.930 --> 06:05.683
I mean, look at him now.

06:08.060 --> 06:13.738
- Josh, things can get better,
maybe not perfect, but better.

06:13.770 --> 06:16.808
- Look, I know it's
a lot to ask for,

06:16.840 --> 06:18.899
but what do you say?

06:21.580 --> 06:23.548
(Sighing)

06:25.150 --> 06:26.709
- I gotta jog it out.

06:30.550 --> 06:32.018
- Is that good?
- It's not a "no."

06:32.050 --> 06:33.051
(Door closing)

06:52.680 --> 06:55.672
- Oh, great! It's Sally.

06:57.210 --> 07:01.511
- OK, before I begin, I just
want to reiterate how sorry I am

07:01.550 --> 07:03.188
about how things
ended last time.

07:03.220 --> 07:05.643
Your flesh, your brains:

07:05.690 --> 07:08.489
totally safe, as are any pets.

07:08.520 --> 07:11.080
- You wonder why I told
you to stay away?

07:11.130 --> 07:13.121
- But now I'm back
to being old Sally,

07:13.160 --> 07:14.924
regular, old,
boring ghost Sally.

07:14.960 --> 07:18.464
- The one who shredded Nick and
killed my entire support group?

07:18.500 --> 07:21.037
- I see we still have some
issues to work through.

07:21.070 --> 07:23.539
- Why are you here?

07:23.570 --> 07:25.561
- I really need your help, Zoe.

07:25.610 --> 07:28.875
I know that I've said
this many, many times before,

07:28.910 --> 07:31.049
but something really
awful happened

07:31.080 --> 07:33.048
to a little girl in her house.

07:33.080 --> 07:34.809
- Why? What'd you do to her?

07:34.850 --> 07:36.215
- I didn't do anything!

07:36.250 --> 07:39.140
A group of chanting cult
ladies did. I just watched.

07:39.190 --> 07:40.680
- Not helping your case.

07:40.720 --> 07:42.779
- I watched because
I couldn't stop them.

07:42.830 --> 07:45.583
- Was someone holding
your non-corporeal form down?

07:45.630 --> 07:47.997
Were you trapped in
a salt box? I don't follow.

07:48.030 --> 07:50.499
- Look, I need to help
her now. I need to!

07:50.530 --> 07:52.191
What if her soul
is still out there?

07:52.230 --> 07:54.096
What if she's never
gotten her door?

07:54.140 --> 07:56.859
What if that group of cult
leaders kidnapped her,

07:56.910 --> 07:58.560
and then made
her a sister bride

07:58.610 --> 08:00.135
and forced her to
live in a tent.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.932
- OK, fine! T'll do it.

08:01.980 --> 08:03.869
- Really?

08:05.680 --> 08:07.011
- Do I have a choice?

08:21.700 --> 08:23.828
(Panting)

08:23.870 --> 08:25.224
(Gasping)

08:27.640 --> 08:28.789
I'm S O SO I ry I

08:29.840 --> 08:31.968
I didn't mean to scare you.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.568
Listen, I'm like you.

08:36.880 --> 08:41.249
I'm a wolf, but you,
you're pregnant.

08:43.350 --> 08:50.984
- (Crying): I just
wish I knew with what.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.297
I'm sorry, I'm new to this.

08:54.330 --> 08:56.822
I'm not used to meeting
people who understand.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.599
And how did you know what I was?

08:58.630 --> 09:01.895
I mean, I'm standing right next
to you, pregnant and a werewolf,

09:01.940 --> 09:03.032
and I can't smell you.

09:03.070 --> 09:04.868
- Yeah, I've been one longer.

09:04.910 --> 09:09.006
Normally, I wouldn't
come up to you,

09:09.040 --> 09:13.819
but I got a hit of fear,
distress, maybe.

09:13.850 --> 09:16.945
- Yup, that's me in nutshell.

09:18.190 --> 09:19.919
- I'm sorry this
happened to you.

09:19.960 --> 09:22.054
- I hate that thing for
what it did to me,

09:22.090 --> 09:24.650
so how is it possible
for me to be grateful too.

09:24.690 --> 09:27.057
- How--how do you mean?

09:27.100 --> 09:30.092
- My husband and I
had this great life.

09:30.130 --> 09:34.863
We just had this one giant
hole. We couldn't conceive.

09:34.900 --> 09:37.130
I'm lousy at making babies.

09:39.140 --> 09:41.632
- How long had
you been trying?

09:41.680 --> 09:46.049
- Five years! IUI, IVF, shots in
my ass, adoption agencies,

09:46.080 --> 09:49.050
just one month of
heartbreak after another.

09:49.080 --> 09:53.153
And then we went glamping in
the Berkshires for his birthday,

09:53.190 --> 09:55.056
and that thing got us.

09:55.090 --> 09:57.627
It's a miracle we survived.

09:57.660 --> 10:00.095
- Your husband,
he's one too?

10:00.130 --> 10:02.997
- Yeah! Andrew.

10:03.030 --> 10:05.260
- After the first
turn, I told him:

10:05.300 --> 10:09.066
"I never wanted to go through
that kind of pain again.

10:09.100 --> 10:11.410
"T'd rather die than
go through it."

10:11.440 --> 10:15.035
And then this happened.

10:15.080 --> 10:16.946
That was 3 months ago.

10:18.310 --> 10:20.119
- This is you at 3 months?

10:20.150 --> 10:21.413
- I know!

10:21.450 --> 10:24.283
It's more like 10 months,

10:24.320 --> 10:27.915
but every turn, I don't
know it survives,

10:27.960 --> 10:29.826
but we do.

10:29.860 --> 10:31.419
- Have you seen a doctor?

10:31.460 --> 10:34.851
- No, not since
the first turn.

10:34.900 --> 10:37.722
I'm afraid of
what they'll find.

10:37.770 --> 10:41.400
- My wife is a nurse.
Let's go to the hospital.

10:41.440 --> 10:44.865
We'll start with an ultrasound.
We'll see what you're having.

10:44.910 --> 10:47.777
- Are we talking
gender or species?

10:47.810 --> 10:50.370
** That a bird in
the hand is worthless *

10:50.410 --> 10:53.072
* If you're too scared **

10:54.150 --> 10:55.117
- Whoa!

10:55.150 --> 10:56.743
- AR

10:56.790 --> 10:59.111
- You have keys in your
hand like you're leaving.

10:59.150 --> 11:01.881
- I do, but, oh, you know what,
um, I completely forgot.

11:01.920 --> 11:04.184
I was gonna call
you to reschedule.

11:04.230 --> 11:07.120
- I ditched a faculty
meeting to plan this vacation.

11:07.160 --> 11:09.424
- I know. I'm sorry, work
called, and it's crazy.

11:09.460 --> 11:11.064
It's an all-hands kind of thing.

11:11.100 --> 11:12.966
- I just got off
the phone with Nora.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.229
She says it's a ghost town?

11:14.270 --> 11:16.910
- It's because it's
a different wing.

11:16.940 --> 11:18.430
- Mm-hmm...
- So...

11:18.470 --> 11:22.134
- Look, I already put
in for these 2 weeks off.

11:22.180 --> 11:23.909
I need to book something.

11:23.950 --> 11:26.169
My clicker finger,
it's getting itchy.

11:26.210 --> 11:28.713
- (Laughing):
Mine too, seriously!

11:28.750 --> 11:30.445
And I am so sorry
for being an idiot,

11:30.490 --> 11:34.882
but sometime very soon we
are going to sit down

11:34.920 --> 11:39.153
and we are gonna have maps and
brochures and thumbtacks and...

11:39.190 --> 11:41.989
- I don't need thumbtacks.
I need some reservations!

11:42.030 --> 11:44.021
- And we will make
them, I promise.

11:44.070 --> 11:46.323
- That's what you said
when we made this plan!

11:46.370 --> 11:48.759
- Have I ever told
you how amazing you are?

11:48.800 --> 11:50.404
You are so beautiful!
- I hate you.

11:50.440 --> 11:53.307
- (Sally): Anything
new on the home front?

11:53.340 --> 11:55.308
- I moved!
- Oh, nice! Yeah!

11:55.340 --> 11:58.105
Makes sense,
a fresh start. Where to?

11:58.150 --> 12:00.244
- Oh, somewhere
I didn't find parts of Nick

12:00.280 --> 12:02.009
every time I watered the plants.

12:02.050 --> 12:03.381
- Sorry.

12:04.550 --> 12:06.143
He was a really great guy.

12:06.190 --> 12:09.057
- Yeah, he was!
Until he wasn't.

12:11.230 --> 12:13.198
- What about the neighbours?

12:13.230 --> 12:15.221
New neighbours?
Anyone nice? Single?

12:15.260 --> 12:18.161
- How about we just stick to
your little Nancy Drew project.

12:18.200 --> 12:20.794
- Did you find something?

12:20.840 --> 12:22.239
- City records say your house

12:22.270 --> 12:24.910
was owned by Carl
and Joy Benson in the '70s.

12:24.940 --> 12:27.773
- Did they have a daughter?
- You think it tells me that?

12:27.810 --> 12:30.404
When you saw her ghost, did
you ask what happened to her?

12:30.450 --> 12:32.407
- I haven't actually
seen her ghost.

12:32.450 --> 12:35.078
- Well, I thought you said
she was killed in the '70s.

12:35.120 --> 12:36.440
- I think she was killed,

12:36.480 --> 12:38.983
but when I saw her,
she was still alive.

12:39.020 --> 12:41.785
- How did you see
someone living in the '70s?

12:41.820 --> 12:44.221
- Because I get unhooked
sometimes in time.

12:44.260 --> 12:46.149
Only when I do spells,
from that witch,

12:46.190 --> 12:48.329
the one that brought
me back from the dead.

12:48.360 --> 12:51.466
- I can't believe
I said yes to this.

12:51.500 --> 12:53.229
(Computer keys clicking)

12:53.270 --> 12:55.068
Oh! They did
have a daughter.

12:56.200 --> 12:57.964
- That's L'il Smokie!

12:58.010 --> 13:00.479
- That's the worst hippie
name I've ever heard.

13:00.510 --> 13:04.208
- I just saw her peddling party
snacks once. Not important!

13:04.250 --> 13:08.346
- Carl and Joy Benson
with daughter Beatrice

13:08.380 --> 13:10.815
on Mayford Street for
the 4th of July parade.”

13:10.850 --> 13:13.558
- Beatrice...
What happened to her?

13:13.590 --> 13:16.514
(Computer keys clicking)

13:16.560 --> 13:19.222
- OK, a couple of
Beatrice Benson's come up,

13:19.260 --> 13:22.252
and there's nothing about
cults or murder or kidnapping.

13:22.300 --> 13:24.997
- OK, we have to find
out what happened to her.

13:25.030 --> 13:26.293
Her poor parents!

13:26.330 --> 13:29.095
- County records saw that
when they sold the house,

13:29.140 --> 13:31.302
the Bensons bought
a home in Brookline.

13:31.340 --> 13:33.035
(Siren wailing in distance)

13:33.080 --> 13:36.106
We're going to
Brookline, aren't we?

13:36.140 --> 13:38.040
- They're late.

13:38.080 --> 13:40.071
- She's got a lot
on her mind.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.849
You having 2nd thoughts?

13:41.880 --> 13:43.188
- This is a
horrible idea.

13:43.220 --> 13:45.086
- You should give her a chance.

13:45.120 --> 13:47.088
I think you'll
actually like her.

13:47.120 --> 13:50.579
- But do we really want to
be doing more wolf outreach?

13:50.630 --> 13:53.122
Everything that happened

13:53.160 --> 13:57.620
with Connor, Brynn, Erin...

13:57.670 --> 14:00.162
- When I first saw Caroline,

14:00.200 --> 14:02.567
I thought of you
when you got pregnant.

14:02.600 --> 14:06.059
"Lucky" isn't the right word
to describe a miscarriage,

14:06.110 --> 14:09.501
but that was the first
word that came to mind.

14:09.540 --> 14:11.372
- No! It's the right word.

14:12.550 --> 14:15.076
The prize for surviving
this pregnancy

14:15.120 --> 14:17.509
Is passing the curse
onto your Kids.

14:17.550 --> 14:20.315
We dodged the bullet
that hit them.

14:26.630 --> 14:28.029
- AR

14:28.060 --> 14:29.596
- This is Andrew.
- (Nora): Hi!

14:29.630 --> 14:32.327
- You must be Nora. Thank
you so much for doing this!

14:32.370 --> 14:34.464
- Why are we sneaking
in the back way?

14:34.500 --> 14:36.366
- No, we're not sneaking in.

14:36.400 --> 14:39.370
The last time I was here,
I assaulted somebody, so...

14:39.410 --> 14:41.606
(Knocking on door)

14:44.280 --> 14:45.600
- Hi!

14:45.650 --> 14:47.539
-Can I come in?

14:51.650 --> 14:56.417
- That depends. What's the plan
for that stake in your coat?

14:59.190 --> 15:01.295
- You have a very good eye.

15:03.230 --> 15:06.427
- Well, you don't survive
as long as we have without it.

15:06.470 --> 15:09.189
- What's the real reason
you came back to Boston?

15:09.240 --> 15:11.129
- I told you, I was nostalgic.

15:11.170 --> 15:15.209
- I saw videos of the
blood den, of what you did.

15:15.240 --> 15:18.505
- I didn't want to have to
explain things to you like this!

15:18.550 --> 15:21.076
- Well, brunch is
gonna have to wait.

15:23.050 --> 15:27.317
- I came back to Boston for
the same reason I do anything,

15:27.360 --> 15:30.386
to kill vampires
before they kill people.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.353
- Does that include me?

15:32.390 --> 15:35.621
- It doesn't have to,
not if you help me.

15:43.570 --> 15:45.265
- Because I don't
go to blood dens

15:45.310 --> 15:47.278
doesn't mean I would
murder people who do!

15:47.310 --> 15:48.607
- They're junkies!

15:48.640 --> 15:50.699
The difference is when
they slip, people die!

15:50.750 --> 15:52.673
- We try to help
them not to slip.

15:52.710 --> 15:55.270
We give them things
like blood dens

15:55.320 --> 15:57.186
because they have
a right to live.

15:57.220 --> 15:58.710
<i>- But not to kill.
- But you do?</i>

15:58.750 --> 16:01.754
- They took the best
part of us, didn't they,

16:01.790 --> 16:03.349
what was human.

16:03.390 --> 16:06.087
The ones I dusted were
weak-willed bottom feeders.

16:06.130 --> 16:07.552
If I didn't stop them,

16:07.600 --> 16:09.557
there would be some
other couple, family,

16:09.600 --> 16:10.624
just like you and I,

16:10.670 --> 16:12.024
that they will destroy.

16:12.070 --> 16:13.492
- That was 200 years ago!

16:13.540 --> 16:16.498
- Oh no, that's tonight or
tomorrow or a century from now,

16:16.540 --> 16:17.564
and it'll never end.

16:17.610 --> 16:19.499
- Suzanna, you're
killing people.

16:19.540 --> 16:20.610
Not just killing them.

16:20.640 --> 16:22.335
You're wiping them
from existence,

16:22.380 --> 16:24.041
and all because
they drink blood.

16:24.080 --> 16:25.775
Now, I saw the
way that you fought,

16:25.810 --> 16:29.371
and there is no way you
could've pulled that off

16:29.420 --> 16:30.740
without drinking.

16:30.790 --> 16:34.181
- You're right. I do!

16:34.220 --> 16:36.518
70 ml a day.

16:36.560 --> 16:39.621
That's just one
heartbeat's worth of blood.

16:39.660 --> 16:43.563
I'm not groggy. I'm not jittery.
It's the perfect amount!

16:45.170 --> 16:49.266
- Well, that's, yes, that's
what I aspire to, sure

16:49.300 --> 16:52.804
but that's not... Uh-uh,
no, that's not possible.

16:52.840 --> 16:55.070
- Maybe you should try it.

16:55.110 --> 16:57.408
- I feel like you're
trying to sell me a juicer.

16:57.450 --> 17:00.818
Suzanna, you understand what
we are, and you know the hunger,

17:00.850 --> 17:03.148
and it ain't like cutting carbs.

17:03.190 --> 17:04.544
What, you never slip?

17:04.589 --> 17:07.150
- No, if I did, I'd
be just like them.

17:07.190 --> 17:09.750
- Then, what about me,
because I've slipped,

17:09.790 --> 17:13.089
and if I'm honest about it,
I probably will again.

17:13.130 --> 17:17.294
- Maybe. Maybe I have a
little bit more faith in you

17:17.329 --> 17:18.525
to get it right.

17:18.569 --> 17:20.834
I'm the only thing alive

17:20.869 --> 17:25.501
that knows the best part
of you, the human part.

17:25.540 --> 17:28.406
And you miss it, as
I've seen how you live.

17:30.280 --> 17:31.770
We were married.

17:31.810 --> 17:35.849
We shared the same values
then, and maybe still now,

17:35.880 --> 17:38.850
which is why we
should work together.

17:38.890 --> 17:43.384
- Suzanna, the ones that are
running Boston are different.

17:43.430 --> 17:45.785
Aside from the live stuff,

17:45.830 --> 17:48.856
there was bagged
blood at that den.

17:48.900 --> 17:51.119
There's a truce between
us and the wolves.

17:51.170 --> 17:53.468
Now, I don't know all
these vampires personally,

17:53.500 --> 17:56.731
but don't you think we
ought to give them a chance

17:56.770 --> 17:58.465
to prove themselves?

17:58.510 --> 18:02.208
- Well, a quarter can't land
on its side, can it, Aidan?

18:02.240 --> 18:05.778
So it's up to you. It's
simple. It's them or it's me.

18:10.890 --> 18:13.689
- If they don't get here
soon, I'm outta here.

18:13.720 --> 18:15.358
- It's been, like, 2 hours!

18:15.390 --> 18:18.826
- You're a ghost. You don't get
hungry or need pee breaks.

18:18.860 --> 18:20.589
(Siren wailing in distance)

18:20.630 --> 18:23.622
- Can we listen to some music?
What do you have on that thing?

18:23.670 --> 18:26.423
(* Man singing
on stereo, indistinct *)

18:26.470 --> 18:30.134
Anything that doesn't make
me want to bathe with a toaster?

18:34.640 --> 18:36.870
- Saved by the Bensons?

18:38.950 --> 18:40.873
(Car door closing)

18:43.550 --> 18:45.780
- Oh my God, her poor parents!

18:45.820 --> 18:49.450
Can you imagine, like,
never seeing your daughter?

18:49.490 --> 18:51.219
- Hi!

18:51.260 --> 18:53.490
- Oh my God, she's
like a L'il Smokie clone.

18:53.530 --> 18:55.897
- I'm with the Historical
Preservation Society!

18:57.300 --> 18:58.665
(Muttering
indistinctly)

18:58.700 --> 19:00.668
Do Carl and
Joy Benson live here?

19:00.700 --> 19:02.634
- No.
- Did they move or...

19:02.670 --> 19:05.207
- They died.
- She's direct.

19:05.240 --> 19:07.880
- Well, they had a
daughter named Beatrice who...

19:07.910 --> 19:09.469
- Died 40 years ago.

19:09.510 --> 19:11.899
- Mom, somebody's
looking for you!

19:15.650 --> 19:19.689
- OK, so we do a week
in the Canadian Rockies

19:19.720 --> 19:21.279
and then a week here?

19:21.320 --> 19:22.617
- Yeah, OK!

19:22.660 --> 19:25.960
- (Laughing): Or would
you rather a road trip?

19:25.990 --> 19:28.960
I'm not 100% sure what
the Natchez Trace is,

19:29.000 --> 19:31.367
but hey, I'd love
to say I drove it.

19:31.400 --> 19:33.368
- OK, let's do that then.

19:33.400 --> 19:35.892
- I'm sorry! I'm acting
like this is all my trip,

19:35.940 --> 19:38.568
but you're burning
2 weeks of vacation time too.

19:38.610 --> 19:40.430
- It's not exactly
a sacrifice.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.699
I mean, check it out, right?

19:42.740 --> 19:44.549
(Laughing)

19:44.580 --> 19:46.799
- All right, so where
do you wanna go?

19:46.850 --> 19:49.376
I mean, is there some
place you visited as a kid

19:49.420 --> 19:50.979
that you wanna see again?

19:51.020 --> 19:53.580
- I didn't really
travel much as a kid.

19:53.620 --> 19:56.851
Well, I mean, look, OK, we
went to the Cape every summer.

19:56.890 --> 19:59.928
We stayed at a terrible
motel in Barnstable. It was...

19:59.960 --> 20:03.396
- I love Barnstable!
What was the terrible motel?

20:03.430 --> 20:06.400
- Um, it was-- You know
what, it was actually...

20:06.430 --> 20:09.229
No, it was Hyannis, now
that I think about it.

20:10.570 --> 20:12.538
- Oh!
- What?

20:12.570 --> 20:15.938
- Trying to get an answer
out of you about your past

20:15.980 --> 20:18.472
is like playing whack-a-mole.

20:18.510 --> 20:21.013
- Look, it was a long time
ago. I'm sorry. I forget.

20:21.050 --> 20:22.677
- But no, that's the thing,

20:22.720 --> 20:24.814
because anything
that has to do with,

20:24.850 --> 20:27.717
200 hundred years ago,
you are a Wikipedia entry.

20:27.760 --> 20:30.980
But then, I ask you
about last summer,

20:31.030 --> 20:33.749
and you're Memento.

20:33.800 --> 20:37.691
(Laughing): I mean, look,
you're lucky I trust you,

20:37.730 --> 20:39.869
otherwise I might think
you're a sociopath.

20:39.900 --> 20:42.494
- (Kat): What the
hell are you doing here?

20:42.540 --> 20:45.635
- I just wanna talk to you.
- No! No! No!

20:45.670 --> 20:47.775
Get off of me! Aaah!

20:47.810 --> 20:50.905
- You're calm. You're happy.

20:50.950 --> 20:53.647
- Do you think that it--
- It worked.

20:53.680 --> 20:57.844
- Look, I know I've
been pushing this trip hard.

20:57.890 --> 21:01.349
I thought we were there!
I mean, maybe we're not.

21:01.390 --> 21:03.017
- Whoa, one second!
No, no, no, no!

21:03.060 --> 21:04.619
We're there.
We are so there.

21:04.660 --> 21:07.049
It is not that.
- Well, it's something.

21:07.090 --> 21:10.321
I really wanna do this,
but I'm not gonna beg,

21:10.370 --> 21:13.362
SO you need to decide
whether you're in or out.

21:15.770 --> 21:17.909
- (Andrew):
Which is the ultrasound tech?

21:17.940 --> 21:19.863
- I subbed a week
in Labour and Delivery.

21:19.910 --> 21:22.072
- You kidding me?
We're not supposed to be here.

21:22.110 --> 21:24.078
And you don't even
know what you're doing.

21:24.110 --> 21:25.646
- It's an ultrasound.

21:25.680 --> 21:28.809
You squirt gel, do a wandy-wand
and look at the screen.

21:28.850 --> 21:31.740
- They're risking a lot
more than we are by being here.

21:31.790 --> 21:33.952
She's a nurse! She's got this!

21:33.990 --> 21:37.426
- Do you want to, uh,
hand me the thingie?

21:37.460 --> 21:38.552
- The transducer?

21:38.590 --> 21:40.649
- We--we know what it is!

21:40.700 --> 21:41.929
- Honey...

21:41.960 --> 21:44.395
(High-pitched ringing,
Josh screams)

21:44.430 --> 21:46.091
- Is he OK?

21:46.130 --> 21:47.962
<i>- Just point that
away from me!</i>

21:50.100 --> 21:52.831
- OK, this is gonna feel
a little bit cold. OK.

21:52.870 --> 21:57.376
(Baby's heart beating)

21:57.410 --> 21:59.378
- It's beating so fast.

21:59.410 --> 22:00.718
- It's normal
for a fetus.

22:00.750 --> 22:01.842
(Heart beating rapidly)

22:01.880 --> 22:04.588
- How come it's beating
so much faster?

22:04.620 --> 22:06.918
- I think I see the spine.
- Of what?

22:06.950 --> 22:09.089
- I'm trying to
get a better look.

22:09.120 --> 22:11.452
(Screaming, heart
beating rapidly)

22:11.490 --> 22:13.959
- You're hurting her!
- Oh!

22:14.000 --> 22:17.630
- (Crying): No, keep going!
I need to know!

22:19.000 --> 22:20.468
(Caroline screaming)

22:20.500 --> 22:22.798
- All right, stop
your wife or I will!

22:22.840 --> 22:23.807
(Both grunting)

22:23.840 --> 22:25.865
(Panting)

22:25.910 --> 22:27.799
- (Nora):
I think I've got something!

22:27.840 --> 22:30.332
- Oh my God, are those nails?

22:34.050 --> 22:36.610
- I don't know what
the hell you are,

22:36.650 --> 22:37.879
but you stay away from us.

22:37.920 --> 22:40.480
(Grunting)

22:40.520 --> 22:46.527
- Sorry!

22:49.030 --> 22:51.863
- I tried to forget,
but look at those pants!

22:51.900 --> 22:54.562
I don't know what my
parents were thinking!

22:54.600 --> 22:57.501
- So that's definitely you in
the photo with your parents?

22:57.540 --> 22:58.769
- For the 3rd time, yes!

22:58.810 --> 23:00.608
- All right,
I get it! Moving on!

23:00.640 --> 23:03.541
- A neighbour snapped this
and sent it into the newspaper.

23:03.580 --> 23:05.446
I was famous for a week!

23:05.480 --> 23:08.609
- Would you say you
had a normal childhood?

23:08.650 --> 23:09.776
- Why do you ask?

23:09.820 --> 23:12.790
- Because someone tried
human sacrificing you.

23:12.820 --> 23:15.881
- It seems like an odd question
from the preservation society.

23:15.920 --> 23:17.888
- (Sally):
It does, though, doesn't it.

23:17.930 --> 23:20.422
- We're doing an oral
history of the neighbourhood,

23:20.460 --> 23:22.827
stories about that time.

23:22.860 --> 23:26.728
Any big events? Crimes?
Anything come to mind?

23:26.770 --> 23:28.169
- You are a
scary good liar.

23:28.200 --> 23:29.929
- Someone stole my bike once.

23:29.970 --> 23:32.667
- She's suppressing
something. Come on! Dig deep!

23:32.710 --> 23:35.577
- Well, I think I've taken
up enough of your time.

23:35.610 --> 23:38.910
- What? No, you haven't!
- So we-- I should get going!

23:38.950 --> 23:40.975
- OK! I hope you
got what you needed.

23:41.020 --> 23:42.010
- Yup!

23:48.190 --> 23:49.612
- Hey!
- Hey!

23:49.660 --> 23:51.822
- Let me guess, your
husband's out on a jog.

23:51.860 --> 23:54.500
- Surprise! I'll let him
know you're looking for him.

23:54.530 --> 23:56.828
- Well, actually,
I'm looking for you.

23:56.860 --> 23:58.760
- Whoo! What's up?

23:58.800 --> 24:01.667
- Well, first, I just
wanted to say thank you

24:01.700 --> 24:03.532
for not treating Kenny
like a pariah.

24:03.570 --> 24:06.505
- Seeing him look so much
better gave me hope for Josh.

24:06.540 --> 24:07.701
- Hmm!

24:07.740 --> 24:10.505
- So how's he doing?
What's he up to?

24:10.550 --> 24:14.976
- Well, he's running things out
of Bishop's old funeral home.

24:15.020 --> 24:17.546
- Maybe we don't
tell Josh that part.

24:17.590 --> 24:21.754
- Yeah, deal. Listen,
I had a favour to ask you.

24:21.790 --> 24:26.023
Kat has invited me
on a vacation for 2 weeks.

24:26.060 --> 24:27.926
- That's great, isn't it?

24:27.960 --> 24:30.122
- It can be tricky!
- Like, emotionally tricky?

24:30.160 --> 24:32.720
- More like care-and-feeding-
of-your-vampire tricky

24:32.770 --> 24:35.660
I mean, like, I can't take
bagged blood through security

24:35.700 --> 24:38.761
and pretending to eat and
faking human for that long.

24:38.810 --> 24:40.209
It's just exhausting.

24:40.240 --> 24:43.073
There are places like the
Bahamas that I can't go.

24:43.110 --> 24:45.101
- Too much sunlight?

24:45.150 --> 24:47.175
- I murdered their
prime minister once.

24:47.210 --> 24:49.645
Bahamians have
really long memories.

24:49.680 --> 24:52.945
- So if you can't bring blood,
then who do you get it from?

24:54.160 --> 24:56.185
Not Kat?
- Oh God, no!

24:56.220 --> 25:00.521
No! Drunk college students
or drunk businessmen.

25:00.560 --> 25:02.096
Drunks!

25:02.130 --> 25:03.962
- So what do you
need from me?

25:04.000 --> 25:05.092
- Come on!

25:09.570 --> 25:13.677
I need you to memorize this.

25:13.710 --> 25:15.838
- What is this?

25:15.880 --> 25:19.669
- So you're, like,
a super low-rent Jason Bourne.

25:19.710 --> 25:21.075
- Every few decades,

25:21.120 --> 25:24.215
we have to reinvent
ourselves, and this is me.

25:24.250 --> 25:27.652
- You wrote an
autobiography? Adorbs!

25:27.690 --> 25:30.751
Look, you even drew
a little family tree!

25:30.790 --> 25:32.679
So what do you need from me?

25:32.730 --> 25:35.222
- If you could be off book
with this in 2 weeks,

25:35.260 --> 25:36.750
that would be great.

25:36.800 --> 25:40.259
- So, your first instinct
when you meet someone you like

25:40.300 --> 25:41.893
is to lie to them

25:41.940 --> 25:44.637
and then try and rope
other people into that lie?

25:44.670 --> 25:46.035
- Works really well.

25:46.070 --> 25:47.777
- Why do I have
to learn all this

25:47.810 --> 25:50.029
when you're the one
going on vacation with her?

25:50.080 --> 25:51.809
(Groaning)

25:51.850 --> 25:56.048
- Because, Nora, because
I want this 2 weeks to...

25:56.080 --> 25:58.014
- Go on!

25:58.050 --> 25:59.939
- ...to be the beginning

25:59.990 --> 26:03.358
of me and Kat spending
a lot more time together.

26:03.390 --> 26:06.690
- You're getting really
serious about her, aren't you?

26:06.730 --> 26:10.826
- It's been a few decades since
I've met anyone like her.

26:12.030 --> 26:13.930
- OK, I'll do it.

26:13.970 --> 26:15.199
- You will!

26:15.240 --> 26:18.767
- But I know how
dangerous your world is.

26:18.810 --> 26:20.335
Keep her safe from it.

26:20.370 --> 26:21.576
- I will.

26:23.410 --> 26:25.708
- Oh, and one other condition!

26:25.750 --> 26:27.070
- Yeah.

26:27.110 --> 26:31.286
- Your nickname from
high school is now Chuggy.

26:31.320 --> 26:33.084
(Laughing)

26:35.090 --> 26:37.218
- Well, she's hiding something.

26:37.260 --> 26:39.251
- Like what?
- I don't know!

26:39.290 --> 26:42.055
That's why we keep asking
questions instead of leaving.

26:42.100 --> 26:43.966
- You don't have
to ask the questions,

26:44.000 --> 26:45.365
which means you
don't sit there

26:45.400 --> 26:47.994
while they stare at you
like you're a crazy person.

26:48.040 --> 26:50.907
- So a cult kills a little
girl, and you're OK with that?

26:50.940 --> 26:53.637
- If they killed a little
girl, then who was she?

26:53.680 --> 26:57.275
I said I would help
you find Beatrice. I did.

26:57.310 --> 27:00.644
If you want to go back
and haunt her, I can't stop you.

27:00.680 --> 27:02.671
But I lived up to
my part of the deal.

27:02.720 --> 27:04.085
Live up to yours. Let it go!

27:07.020 --> 27:08.909
(Bird squawking)

27:08.960 --> 27:12.385
- Zoe! L'il Smokie Junior
Is staring at us.

27:17.260 --> 27:19.695
- OK. That was
kind of creepy.

27:19.730 --> 27:21.266
- And she's back in!

27:21.300 --> 27:22.790
- No!
- She's back!

27:22.840 --> 27:25.662
- No, I'm not! Can
you blame her for staring?

27:25.710 --> 27:28.736
Some weird lady shows up at her
mom's house and asks questions

27:28.780 --> 27:30.100
about her dead grandparents.

27:30.140 --> 27:31.403
I'd keep an eye on me too!

27:31.450 --> 27:34.112
- They're not telling
us everything!

27:34.150 --> 27:37.347
- That's because normal people
don't tell everybody everything.

27:37.380 --> 27:39.849
You're the exception
here, Sally, not her.

27:44.760 --> 27:47.024
(Car horns honking)

27:51.300 --> 27:53.837
- Gentleman, as you were.

27:53.870 --> 27:57.192
Kenny? Listen closely.

27:57.240 --> 28:01.074
I know who she is.
I know where to find her.

28:05.280 --> 28:08.113
- So, fine, I mean,
I didn't see the knife

28:08.150 --> 28:09.845
actually pierce
through her heart,

28:09.880 --> 28:11.780
but I know it did.

28:11.820 --> 28:15.051
They killed her.
She's dead. I know that.

28:15.090 --> 28:17.252
(Josh panting)

28:17.290 --> 28:19.019
Are you even listening to me?

28:19.060 --> 28:21.825
- Yes! Knife,
L'il Smokie, Satanists...

28:21.860 --> 28:23.897
- I'm not 100% sure
they were Satanists,

28:23.930 --> 28:25.329
but they were
definitely culty.

28:25.370 --> 28:28.192
- OK, can you just explain to me

28:28.240 --> 28:30.334
this quantum thing
again, all right?

28:30.370 --> 28:33.362
Are you sure you're not just
having really vivid dreams?

28:33.410 --> 28:35.071
- No, listen, Josh,

28:35.110 --> 28:37.909
if I could explain this
to you more clearly, I would.

28:37.950 --> 28:42.342
All I know is that when I
do the-- When I do the stuff...

28:42.380 --> 28:44.382
<i>- You can say magic.
Tm with you.</i>

28:44.420 --> 28:46.889
- ...it opens a wormhole.

28:46.920 --> 28:49.218
I don't know, and I'm
there, and then I'm not.

28:49.260 --> 28:50.409
(Laughing)

28:50.460 --> 28:52.883
I'm there and I'm back
and I'm not. I don't know!

28:52.930 --> 28:56.230
Do you think I'm crazy?
- No!

28:56.260 --> 29:00.470
In what universe of
our shared existence

29:00.500 --> 29:02.491
would I call you crazy?

29:02.540 --> 29:05.510
But there is one tiny hiccup
with what you're saying,

29:05.540 --> 29:08.339
and that's that you've met
Beatrice all grown up

29:08.380 --> 29:09.973
with a kid of her own.

29:10.010 --> 29:12.274
- The Beatrice thing
isn't the only weird thing.

29:12.310 --> 29:13.448
Zoe was acting weird.

29:13.480 --> 29:15.471
- Yeah, but she's Zoe.
She's weird.

29:15.520 --> 29:18.046
- No, no! But it was
a different kind of weird.

29:18.090 --> 29:20.218
Like, it's like Zoe's
hiding something now.

29:20.250 --> 29:22.184
(Doorbell buzzing)

29:22.220 --> 29:24.086
- You expecting somebody?
- Nope!

29:25.490 --> 29:27.026
- Her water broke.

29:27.060 --> 29:28.596
- We didn't know
where else to go!

29:31.600 --> 29:34.763
- Oh my God! NORA?

29:46.050 --> 29:48.940
- You got about 5 minutes
to get out of town.

29:50.920 --> 29:54.857
- OK! Andrew's bringing
her upstairs.

29:54.890 --> 29:56.881
I guess this is gonna
be the delivery room.

29:56.920 --> 29:58.854
- Yeah, should I put
down plastic or...

29:58.890 --> 30:01.200
- She's giving birth,
Josh, not getting whacked.

30:01.230 --> 30:03.528
- Yes, I know, but
there's fluids, there's...

30:03.560 --> 30:04.925
(Grunting)

30:04.970 --> 30:06.392
Oh God! Best-case scenario,

30:06.430 --> 30:09.161
we have a nice little
home delivery of something.

30:09.200 --> 30:11.134
Mom and baby make it,

30:11.170 --> 30:13.468
but how often do we
get best case, you know?

30:13.510 --> 30:14.602
Should we save this?

30:14.640 --> 30:17.132
(Caroline panting
and whimpering)

30:17.180 --> 30:19.877
- Oh! Oh!
- (Andrew): What do we do now?

30:19.910 --> 30:21.139
- Time the contractions,

30:21.180 --> 30:22.614
get all the hand sanitizer,

30:22.650 --> 30:24.880
hot water and towels
you can find.

30:24.920 --> 30:26.149
- If there's
complications?

30:26.190 --> 30:28.158
- We'll deal with
them as they come.

30:28.190 --> 30:29.555
- OK, that is not an answer!

30:29.590 --> 30:32.560
- Look, you came here! We just
gotta go with the flow!

30:32.590 --> 30:36.595
- What if it's a breach or she
needs blood? We need a plan!

30:36.630 --> 30:39.497
- Honey, I love you!
- I love you too!

30:39.530 --> 30:41.897
- But you're not helping!

30:41.940 --> 30:43.192
(Screams)

30:43.240 --> 30:44.366
- Let me
get in here.

30:45.370 --> 30:46.906
- What did you tell them?

30:46.940 --> 30:49.978
- I made up a story about
how you're out-of-town muscle

30:50.010 --> 30:51.375
hired to hit blood dens.

30:51.410 --> 30:54.175
- I can't believe you chose
them over me. They're infants!

30:54.220 --> 30:56.973
They're building a new city
over the ruins of the old one.

30:57.020 --> 30:59.614
- You choose sides when you
wanna win. I don't wanna play.

30:59.650 --> 31:01.311
- Then why warn me at all?

31:01.360 --> 31:04.625
- Because I loved you
once more than anything.

31:04.660 --> 31:09.598
- Now you love someone else,
the woman from the party. Kat?

31:09.630 --> 31:12.327
- Excuse me, what did
you just say to me?

31:12.370 --> 31:14.190
You better leave her alone.

31:14.240 --> 31:17.938
- I'm not the one she needs to
be worried about dear, you are.

31:17.970 --> 31:20.132
I tried living a human life too.

31:20.170 --> 31:21.638
I tried it 100 years

31:21.680 --> 31:25.002
before it was even a glimmer
in your blacked-out eyes,

31:25.050 --> 31:26.279
and it never works.

31:26.310 --> 31:29.473
Because the end,
it's always the same.

31:29.520 --> 31:32.683
You wanna turn them
or they wanna be turned

31:32.720 --> 31:35.109
or you kill them.

31:35.160 --> 31:37.219
(Siren wailing in distance)

31:37.260 --> 31:41.629
- Suzanna, you got mel
What do you want me to say?

31:41.660 --> 31:44.163
If you really wanna
know what I'm after,

31:44.200 --> 31:46.396
I just wanna know
what it's like

31:46.430 --> 31:51.106
to have 5 years, 10,

31:51.140 --> 31:53.234
of a real life.

31:55.740 --> 31:59.973
- But it's not real. It's
never real. Tragedy finds us.

32:00.010 --> 32:03.514
If you really love this girl,

32:03.550 --> 32:08.511
the best thing you can do
is break up with her now.

32:20.230 --> 32:23.564
- Hey! So, I've just been
replaying this whole thing.

32:23.600 --> 32:25.204
- Of course, you have.

32:25.240 --> 32:28.403
- You've been cagey since I came
back, and that's cool, but--

32:28.440 --> 32:29.578
- Oh, hi, Lori!

32:29.610 --> 32:32.409
- Hey! Listen,
I need to stay late.

32:32.450 --> 32:35.010
I'll be quiet
when I come to bed.

32:35.050 --> 32:36.211
- Hold the phone!

32:36.250 --> 32:38.082
<i>- (Lori): Love you!
- Yeah! Huh!</i>

32:38.120 --> 32:39.417
- OK...

32:39.450 --> 32:41.680
- And it all becomes clear!

32:41.720 --> 32:44.587
I gotta say, though,
I'm a little offended

32:44.630 --> 32:47.190
you thought I'd judge you
because you're a lesbian.

32:47.230 --> 32:50.325
- OK, first of all,
I don't know what I am.

32:50.360 --> 32:53.091
Probably a bit telling that
the only boyfriend I ever had

32:53.130 --> 32:54.461
couldn't actually touch me.

32:54.500 --> 32:56.559
- We don't need to
put a label on anything.

32:56.600 --> 32:59.365
I'm glad that we cleared
the air. Tell me about Lori!

32:59.410 --> 33:03.176
- No! Sally, I didn't
tell you about Lori

33:03.210 --> 33:06.043
because I care if you
think I'm a lesbian.

33:06.080 --> 33:08.242
I did it because you ruin
everything you touch.

33:08.280 --> 33:10.510
- What?

33:10.550 --> 33:13.520
- You obsess over things.
You can't let them go.

33:13.550 --> 33:15.609
When I get wound up
about something, I say:

33:15.660 --> 33:17.253
"Don't Sally this up!”

33:17.290 --> 33:20.180
- You use my name as a verb?

33:20.230 --> 33:22.494
I was just
trying to help, Zoe.

33:22.530 --> 33:25.329
- That's the lie you tell
yourself every time,

33:25.370 --> 33:28.533
but you possessed bodies even
though you knew it was wrong.

33:28.570 --> 33:31.767
You shredded ghosts...

33:31.810 --> 33:34.074
because you couldn't
accept yourself,

33:34.110 --> 33:35.339
You sent Nick to limbo,

33:35.380 --> 33:37.508
and then you brought
him back as a zombie.

33:37.540 --> 33:40.749
Now you're gonna do the same
with this L'il Smokie girl!

33:40.780 --> 33:43.078
- Nobody knows I messed
up more than I do.

33:43.120 --> 33:44.349
I've had a lot of time

33:44.390 --> 33:46.745
and multiple dimensions
to think about my guilt.

33:46.790 --> 33:49.612
You think I like coming
here and being scorned by you?

33:49.660 --> 33:51.424
I really don't.

33:51.460 --> 33:54.350
I came here because I know
that I'm on to something

33:54.400 --> 33:57.097
and you do too or else you
wouldn't have helped me.

33:57.130 --> 33:59.497
- No, Sally, you
don't get it!

33:59.530 --> 34:02.795
I didn't find Beatrice
to help you.

34:02.840 --> 34:06.231
I did it to protect
them from you.

34:08.810 --> 34:11.541
- (Panting): I know
I sound like an abused wife,

34:11.580 --> 34:13.105
but my husband means well.

34:13.150 --> 34:14.811
- I'm sure he does.

34:14.850 --> 34:17.569
- He wasn't like
that before the attack.

34:17.620 --> 34:21.556
(Laughing): Less like that.
- It changes everyone!

34:21.590 --> 34:24.321
You just hope not so
much that you lose them.

34:24.360 --> 34:26.454
- I can't believe how
fast this is happening.

34:26.489 --> 34:30.324
- I know, but we're
almost there. OK!

34:30.360 --> 34:34.159
- I spent so much time
worrying in the last 5 years

34:34.199 --> 34:36.464
about infertility,
Down syndrome,

34:36.500 --> 34:38.831
pooping myself during delivery.

34:38.870 --> 34:42.204
(Laughing): Wolf baby
didn't exactly make the list!

34:42.239 --> 34:43.206
(Screaming)

34:43.239 --> 34:44.742
- Just keep breathing!

34:44.780 --> 34:46.804
- (Panting): OK!

34:46.850 --> 34:49.342
(Caroline panting and
screaming in distance)

34:49.380 --> 34:51.587
- This is crazy! I'm
gonna go help them out.

34:51.620 --> 34:54.715
- The only thing that's gonna
make a werewolf birth better

34:54.760 --> 34:56.284
is a vampire showing up.

34:56.320 --> 34:59.290
- Look, I know that what
Zoe said to you rattled you,

34:59.330 --> 35:00.422
but forget about it.

35:00.460 --> 35:01.757
It's just her opinion!

35:01.800 --> 35:04.770
- What if Zoe was right.
Do I really screw everything up?

35:04.800 --> 35:07.121
- Well, not everything.

35:10.600 --> 35:12.159
Not anything.

35:12.210 --> 35:14.201
- That's a lie.

35:14.240 --> 35:17.471
- Hey, you do the best
you can with what you know.

35:17.510 --> 35:19.171
You, me and Josh and...

35:19.210 --> 35:20.700
(Caroline groaning
in distance)

35:20.750 --> 35:22.741
- (Caroline): Oh God!
- ...and Nora...

35:22.780 --> 35:25.715
There ain't no guidebook
to this kind of thing.

35:25.750 --> 35:27.479
We're making it up as we go.

35:27.520 --> 35:30.512
- Well, what about
when I do screw up.

35:30.560 --> 35:32.619
- Well then, you
try to make it right.

35:32.660 --> 35:34.549
That's what
you always do.

35:36.500 --> 35:38.662
- I really feel bad
about that little girl,

35:38.700 --> 35:43.365
but if she's grown up to have
this perfectly boring life,

35:43.400 --> 35:45.607
then I don't wanna
mess with that.

35:45.640 --> 35:48.473
- Well, maybe you
let this one go then.

35:49.510 --> 35:50.500
- Would you?

35:50.540 --> 35:53.749
- I can't answer that for you.

35:53.780 --> 35:56.909
But I've stored up
centuries of regret,

35:56.950 --> 35:59.920
and the one thing I can say

35:59.950 --> 36:03.386
is all that you can do,
all that we can ever do...

36:04.960 --> 36:07.327
is try to make it
right next time.

36:13.400 --> 36:16.631
- You never met anyone who hated
camping as much as my wife,

36:16.670 --> 36:18.900
but it was my birthday,
so she surprised me.

36:18.940 --> 36:20.908
- This isn't your fault.

36:20.940 --> 36:23.671
- Well, a bunch of us
got turned that night,

36:23.710 --> 36:26.577
and there was this woman
in the next campsite, Heather.

36:26.610 --> 36:28.374
- Is she a friend?

36:28.420 --> 36:31.913
- Not before. I got to know her
in the hospital and then after.

36:31.950 --> 36:34.658
I heard she died last month.

36:34.690 --> 36:36.385
- How?

36:36.420 --> 36:38.252
- She went home to her husband.

36:38.290 --> 36:40.930
She didn't tell him
that she had changed.

36:40.960 --> 36:44.794
She got pregnant, and
then she died in early labour.

36:44.830 --> 36:46.366
And so did...

36:47.500 --> 36:49.332
whatever it was.

36:49.370 --> 36:51.566
- That's not you!
You're both wolves.

36:51.610 --> 36:55.433
Now, I know this sounds
crazy, but that's a plus.

36:55.480 --> 36:58.302
I mean, the purebreds
can make it. I've met them.

36:58.350 --> 37:00.671
- Well, what are they like?

37:00.710 --> 37:03.577
(Laughing and
clearing throat)

37:03.620 --> 37:07.716
- They're, uh,
charismatic, attractive

37:07.750 --> 37:10.811
and total d-bags!

37:10.860 --> 37:13.022
But that's on the parents.

37:13.060 --> 37:14.926
(Laughing)

37:17.600 --> 37:18.965
- So what are you?

37:19.000 --> 37:20.627
(Caroline screaming)

37:20.670 --> 37:23.469
- (Nora): I need
you in here, guys!

37:23.500 --> 37:25.867
Doing great! More
towels, more towels!

37:25.910 --> 37:28.436
(Crying)

37:28.480 --> 37:29.970
We're almost there, OK?

37:30.010 --> 37:31.648
(Panting)

37:31.680 --> 37:34.377
- Please, Nora,
I can't lose her! I can't!

37:34.420 --> 37:36.570
- Caroline, stay with me, OK?

37:36.620 --> 37:39.840
Just one more push!
One more big push, OK?

37:39.890 --> 37:41.984
On three! Ready?

37:42.020 --> 37:44.352
<i>- (Crying): Yes!
oK!</i>

37:44.390 --> 37:48.998
One, two, three... Push!

37:49.030 --> 37:50.395
(Screaming and crying)

37:50.430 --> 37:51.989
That's it! That's it!

37:52.030 --> 37:54.670
(Baby and Caroline crying)

37:54.700 --> 37:56.634
You did it!

37:56.670 --> 37:58.468
- You did it, honey!
You did it!

37:58.510 --> 37:59.762
(Laughing)

37:59.810 --> 38:01.300
(Caroline sighing)

38:02.640 --> 38:04.540
(Baby crying)

38:07.110 --> 38:08.612
- What is it?

38:08.650 --> 38:11.278
(Baby crying)

38:19.360 --> 38:21.692
(Panting)

38:23.430 --> 38:24.898
- It's a girl.

38:25.900 --> 38:27.459
- (Caroline): Oh!

38:29.570 --> 38:30.890
Give her to me!

38:33.440 --> 38:34.737
(Baby crying loudly)

38:34.780 --> 38:36.373
Come here!

38:41.720 --> 38:43.677
(Baby crying)

38:43.720 --> 38:46.041
- She's perfect!

38:47.950 --> 38:49.816
Thank you.

39:01.540 --> 39:03.736
(Baby whimpering)

39:05.670 --> 39:07.729
(Car horns honking)

39:11.680 --> 39:13.444
- I thought we
were gonna lose her.

39:13.480 --> 39:14.515
(Sighing)

39:14.550 --> 39:15.517
- And the kid!

39:16.720 --> 39:18.939
Then we'd be
stuck with Andrew!

39:18.990 --> 39:20.719
- Yeah.

39:20.750 --> 39:24.425
You know, he might not be
that bad a guy, after all.

39:24.460 --> 39:25.950
(Sighing)

39:25.990 --> 39:28.652
- What if the hard part's
just starting for them?

39:28.700 --> 39:31.522
- I know. Thank God we don't
have to worry about that.

39:31.570 --> 39:32.662
(Sighing)

39:32.700 --> 39:35.533
- Who knows if the kid
even stays human?

39:35.570 --> 39:38.062
One night, you've
got a baby girl,

39:38.100 --> 39:39.659
the next night, Cujo.

39:39.710 --> 39:40.802
(Laughing)

39:40.840 --> 39:42.604
- You know, when
she gets older,

39:42.640 --> 39:44.574
you can teach her
how to ride a bike.

39:44.610 --> 39:46.578
And I'd teach her
not to chase cars.

39:46.610 --> 39:47.941
(Laughing)

39:47.980 --> 39:51.689
- Breastfeeding that thing...
Nice knowing ya, nipples!

39:51.720 --> 39:53.939
(Both laughing)

39:53.990 --> 39:55.480
- Hmm...

39:55.520 --> 39:56.555
(Sighing)

39:57.590 --> 39:59.149
It's a cute baby, though.

40:00.190 --> 40:04.058
- Yeah. She is, isn't she?

40:06.800 --> 40:08.689
(Insects chirping)

40:39.800 --> 40:41.894
- So, what
couldn't wait?

40:41.940 --> 40:44.193
- I wanna travel
with you, everywhere.

40:44.240 --> 40:45.662
But I can't.

40:45.710 --> 40:47.735
- That's what I was afraid of.

40:47.770 --> 40:50.774
- Not until you
know me. Come here.

40:53.250 --> 40:55.639
Uh, have a seat.

40:57.180 --> 40:58.488
(Sighing)

40:58.520 --> 40:59.646
Um...

41:01.590 --> 41:05.151
I have been lying to you,
uh, since the day that we met.

41:06.530 --> 41:08.157
OK, no surprise there.

41:08.190 --> 41:10.898
All right, let me
start over. Um...

41:12.800 --> 41:16.668
I didn't travel to
the Cape when I was a kid.

41:16.700 --> 41:19.032
I didn't-- Well, we
didn't travel anywhere.

41:19.070 --> 41:23.632
No one ever left Corwich,
not until the war came

41:23.680 --> 41:27.969
and my regiment went off
to fight the British.

41:28.010 --> 41:32.516
- The British! As in "The
Redcoats are coming" British?

41:32.550 --> 41:34.040
- Yeah, yeah, those guys.

41:34.090 --> 41:35.580
Um...
- OK.

41:35.620 --> 41:37.213
- I know historical events

41:37.260 --> 41:38.819
really, really well.

41:38.860 --> 41:40.680
That's because I lived them.

41:40.730 --> 41:43.950
And, uh, events
from my childhood,

41:44.000 --> 41:47.095
they're so sketchy
because I, uh,

41:47.130 --> 41:48.996
haven't been a child...

41:50.000 --> 41:51.070
since the 1760s.

41:53.110 --> 41:56.000
All right, it's not making
sense. It's not making sense.

41:56.040 --> 41:58.202
It's not making logical
sense, but listen.

41:58.240 --> 41:59.844
You've been thinking it.

42:00.880 --> 42:02.211
Something is off.

42:02.250 --> 42:04.241
Every time that
I have made a bad excuse

42:04.280 --> 42:06.942
or every time that
I haven't been there for you

42:06.990 --> 42:08.719
or made you question yourself,

42:08.760 --> 42:10.979
now, I didn't want
that for you, Kat.

42:13.660 --> 42:15.094
You deserve the truth.

42:15.130 --> 42:16.757
(Sighing)

42:21.800 --> 42:26.806
I have been alive
for over 200 years...

42:28.070 --> 42:29.970
because I...

42:31.610 --> 42:32.941
am a vampire.

42:36.080 --> 42:39.243
(Laughing)

42:39.290 --> 42:39.347
