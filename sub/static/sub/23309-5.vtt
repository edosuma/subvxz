00:53.951 --> 00:55.496
Sweetheart...

00:56.255 --> 00:58.363
No, I'm about to head
to a dinner reception

00:58.448 --> 01:00.882
for the Bahraini Ambassador.

01:01.146 --> 01:03.000
I'll call you back.

01:03.654 --> 01:05.720
Yes. I love you too.

01:10.106 --> 01:11.393
You see this?

01:11.461 --> 01:14.179
What did I say about leaving any marks?

01:23.373 --> 01:25.173
This is Serhan Dogan.

01:25.242 --> 01:26.908
He's a former army major,

01:26.977 --> 01:29.044
currently the military attachÃ©
for the Turkish Embassy.

01:29.112 --> 01:30.912
He's been with the
delegation for three years,

01:30.981 --> 01:32.347
going back and forth to Istanbul,

01:32.416 --> 01:34.115
where his wife resides.

01:34.184 --> 01:36.217
- He's gone missing.
- How long?

01:36.303 --> 01:37.986
Going on 14 hours.

01:37.992 --> 01:39.279
I thought at least 24 had to pass

01:39.285 --> 01:40.918
before someone's considered missing.

01:40.924 --> 01:42.657
For most people, but
he's a foreign diplomat

01:42.726 --> 01:45.543
who checks in regularly
with his security staff.

01:45.549 --> 01:46.998
And he didn't check in last night?

01:47.004 --> 01:48.530
No, phone goes straight to voicemail.

01:48.536 --> 01:49.660
It's not even emitting a signal.

01:49.666 --> 01:50.799
Maybe he turned it off.

01:50.867 --> 01:52.033
Occasionally, people like to throw off

01:52.038 --> 01:53.581
their electronic yokes.

01:53.587 --> 01:55.337
Yeah, well, his Mercedes
was found abandoned

01:55.405 --> 01:56.838
down by the Anacostia River.

01:56.907 --> 01:58.306
Yeah, that's not good.

01:58.312 --> 01:59.470
No, and with the strained state

01:59.476 --> 02:01.226
of U.S.-Turkish relations,

02:01.232 --> 02:03.599
Director Casey isn't waiting
for an official investigation.

02:03.605 --> 02:05.814
If he's been abducted, we
need to find out by whom

02:05.882 --> 02:07.415
and what it is they want.

02:07.467 --> 02:09.116
It wasn't long ago that
the Turkish ruling party

02:09.122 --> 02:10.615
crushed an attempted coup.

02:10.621 --> 02:13.321
And they've had incidents with
protesters outside their embassy.

02:13.390 --> 02:15.357
Yeah... well, that's an understatement.

02:15.425 --> 02:17.659
I mean, really more like a beat-down.

02:21.598 --> 02:23.898
It could be somebody's
looking for a little payback.

02:23.967 --> 02:25.367
Why don't you two
start with the Embassy?

02:25.435 --> 02:26.674
And Kilroy, see what you can dig

02:26.680 --> 02:27.841
up on his digital footprint.

02:27.904 --> 02:29.471
Speaking of electronic yokes...

02:29.539 --> 02:31.473
Yeah. Well, let's get to work.

02:32.824 --> 02:34.707
Major Dogan never fails to check in.

02:34.713 --> 02:36.082
It goes against the security protocols

02:36.088 --> 02:37.245
he himself has implemented.

02:37.314 --> 02:39.381
When was the last time you
spoke with him, Mr. Kasim?

02:39.449 --> 02:41.950
Yesterday afternoon; he left
to run some personal errands.

02:42.019 --> 02:44.252
- He mention what kind?
- No.

02:44.321 --> 02:45.887
Does Mr. Dogan have any enemies?

02:45.956 --> 02:47.889
Well, of course. Anyone
in his position would.

02:48.123 --> 02:50.256
Well, sure, but any...
Any that can mean him harm?

02:50.325 --> 02:51.791
There was an incident

02:51.860 --> 02:53.586
with the locals from
a Turkish community.

02:53.592 --> 02:55.862
- You mean the protesters?
- No, agitators...

02:55.947 --> 02:57.931
Merely looking to
generate negative press.

02:57.999 --> 02:59.699
Major Dogan did what he had to do

02:59.768 --> 03:01.935
to safeguard the visiting dignitaries.

03:03.004 --> 03:05.922
Like... cracking skulls?

03:06.007 --> 03:08.002
Our security forces dispersed

03:08.008 --> 03:10.415
an unruly mob outside our gates.

03:10.478 --> 03:12.412
Following the incident,
their leader, Beren Hasan,

03:12.447 --> 03:13.813
threatened that the Major's days

03:13.882 --> 03:15.949
- in the Embassy were numbered.
- Right.

03:16.017 --> 03:18.395
Any idea where we can find this Hasan?

03:20.539 --> 03:23.323
- Welcome, two?
- Mm-hmm, please.

03:24.926 --> 03:27.360
We'd like to sit at Mr. Hasan's table.

03:30.699 --> 03:32.615
I'm sorry, Mr. Hasan isn't here.

03:32.701 --> 03:35.101
You sure? Maybe he's in the back.

03:35.170 --> 03:37.337
Snuck in when you weren't looking.

03:39.007 --> 03:40.607
I'll check.

03:40.659 --> 03:42.909
Wait here, please.

03:44.045 --> 03:47.046
Nice girl, not much of
a poker face, though.

03:48.984 --> 03:50.412
Oh, so if it's poker we're playing,

03:50.418 --> 03:51.901
doesn't three of a kind beat a pair?

03:51.987 --> 03:53.219
Yeah, pretty much.

03:53.288 --> 03:56.136
Hey, easy. Easy, fellas.

03:56.191 --> 03:58.057
We're just here looking
for some information

03:58.126 --> 03:59.926
on a guy named Serhan Dogan.

03:59.932 --> 04:01.215
Wait.

04:04.299 --> 04:06.032
You Hasan?

04:06.101 --> 04:07.657
I am.

04:08.336 --> 04:10.003
What is your interest in Dogan?

04:10.055 --> 04:11.471
He's missing.

04:13.041 --> 04:15.475
We heard you had a run-in
with him not long ago,

04:15.543 --> 04:17.043
that you threatened him.

04:17.112 --> 04:19.052
Because he assaulted us.

04:19.764 --> 04:21.297
He's missing, huh?

04:22.000 --> 04:23.983
And you think I must have
something to do with it?

04:23.989 --> 04:25.422
Well, do you?

04:26.955 --> 04:28.554
I do not believe in violence.

04:28.560 --> 04:29.958
No?

04:31.226 --> 04:33.293
What about them?

04:33.361 --> 04:34.527
They're okay with it.

04:39.200 --> 04:40.323
So...

04:41.253 --> 04:44.153
- What do you know about Dogan?
- Why don't you tell us?

04:44.239 --> 04:46.205
Well, I know he's not
the upstanding diplomat

04:46.274 --> 04:48.958
- he projects to the world.
- Meaning what?

04:48.964 --> 04:52.345
Meaning he has another
side, one he hides,

04:52.414 --> 04:55.385
that likes to party, indulge himself.

04:55.733 --> 04:58.067
Gets rough with young prostitutes.

04:58.253 --> 04:59.886
How young?

04:59.892 --> 05:01.450
Young enough to make him a hypocrite

05:01.456 --> 05:03.323
to everything he supposedly stands for,

05:03.391 --> 05:06.125
and deserving whatever
fate has befallen him.

05:08.367 --> 05:10.262
Excuse me.

05:10.832 --> 05:12.298
Yeah?

05:12.367 --> 05:13.900
So, it seems our boy,
Dogan, has been discharging

05:13.969 --> 05:16.035
a little more than just
his duties lately.

05:16.104 --> 05:18.604
So it seems. You have something?

05:18.640 --> 05:20.073
Yeah, I dug into his finances

05:20.141 --> 05:21.474
and found out he's been
paying for a second cell,

05:21.543 --> 05:22.875
uh, a Gordian phone.

05:22.911 --> 05:24.410
Wh... what's that?

05:24.479 --> 05:25.778
It's a... it's an encrypted phone.

05:25.830 --> 05:27.413
Guys with security clearances use 'em,

05:27.482 --> 05:28.681
or guys with something to hide,

05:28.750 --> 05:30.266
namely from their significant others.

05:30.352 --> 05:31.851
Can you get into it if it's encrypted?

05:31.920 --> 05:33.553
Yeah, everything has
its vulnerabilities,

05:33.621 --> 05:36.009
and, luckily, some, uh,
kid in New Zealand

05:36.015 --> 05:37.423
found one in the Gordian OS

05:37.492 --> 05:39.158
and posted it to a hacker forum,

05:39.227 --> 05:41.594
so thanks to Ulian Ackland,
I'm in Dogan's phone.

05:41.629 --> 05:43.463
Kilroy, can you get a location on it?

05:43.531 --> 05:45.231
Yeah, dude, I'm sending it to you now.

05:45.300 --> 05:47.333
- That's why I'm calling you.
- Thank you.

05:54.876 --> 05:57.110
You sure this is the place?

05:57.145 --> 05:59.345
According to Kilroy.

05:59.414 --> 06:01.247
All right.

06:43.675 --> 06:45.375
Dogan.

06:46.961 --> 06:49.295
Looks like he was drugged
and then beaten to death.

06:49.364 --> 06:51.764
Hasan said he liked to get rough.

06:51.833 --> 06:53.977
Scumbag got what he wished for.

06:55.403 --> 06:56.636
Police! Drop your weapons!

06:56.671 --> 06:58.121
Down on the ground! Now!

07:06.493 --> 07:10.283

07:25.810 --> 07:27.893
Detective Lyons, NSID.

07:27.899 --> 07:30.150
Mind telling me what you're
doing at the scene of a murder?

07:30.152 --> 07:31.951
My people were working
in conjunction with

07:31.953 --> 07:34.320
the Turkish Embassy to locate Mr. Dogan.

07:34.322 --> 07:37.157
Under whose authority?
FBI? Homeland Security?

07:37.159 --> 07:39.159
Joint Terrorism Task Force.

07:39.161 --> 07:41.027
When a foreign diplomat like Mr. Dogan

07:41.029 --> 07:42.562
disappears on American soil,

07:42.564 --> 07:44.537
we have to consider all
the possibilities.

07:44.543 --> 07:46.276
That's above my pay grade.

07:46.701 --> 07:48.268
So, we got an anonymous tip

07:48.270 --> 07:50.470
that there was a body in
an abandoned building.

07:50.472 --> 07:52.005
How'd you guys beat us to it?

07:52.007 --> 07:54.474
Because we traced his
phone to this location.

07:54.476 --> 07:56.171
Any idea what he was doing down here?

07:56.177 --> 07:59.195
No, but we were told he likes
to frequent prostitutes.

07:59.197 --> 08:00.647
Figures.

08:00.649 --> 08:03.483
This place is a hotbed
for sex trafficking:

08:03.485 --> 08:04.935
gangs, drugs.

08:04.941 --> 08:07.187
Well, a lot of that demand
comes from the Beltway.

08:07.189 --> 08:08.628
Oh, yeah.

08:08.667 --> 08:11.885
Constant supply of hotshots
wanting to get their jollies.

08:11.887 --> 08:14.137
And we can't touch 'em because
of diplomatic immunity?

08:14.139 --> 08:16.039
Never ends.

08:16.041 --> 08:18.074
I'm guessing Dogan was
probably rolled by a pimp,

08:18.076 --> 08:19.809
lured down here by some young girl.

08:19.811 --> 08:21.331
Yeah, but if he was robbed,

08:21.337 --> 08:23.450
why was he still wearing his
watch and his wedding ring?

08:23.456 --> 08:25.014
And why was he brought here?

08:25.016 --> 08:28.017
Somebody wanted to get
information out of him.

08:28.019 --> 08:29.986
Beating he took was brutal.

08:29.988 --> 08:31.754
Looked personal.

08:31.756 --> 08:33.957
Thanks for your insight.

08:33.958 --> 08:35.892
You found your Dogan then, huh?

08:36.061 --> 08:37.994
This is now officially a
homicide investigation,

08:38.000 --> 08:40.565
so if it's all the same to
you, we'll take it from here.

08:40.650 --> 08:42.899
Of course, Detective Lyons.
We'll leave you to it.

08:51.009 --> 08:52.408
Back already?

08:52.410 --> 08:54.377
Didn't you guys just find a body?

08:54.802 --> 08:57.503
We've been excused. Police business now.

08:57.509 --> 08:59.308
Not quite.

08:59.310 --> 09:01.194
Director is worried Dogan's murder

09:01.196 --> 09:03.196
will enflame tensions between
Turkey's ruling class

09:03.198 --> 09:04.714
and opposition groups like Hasan's,

09:04.716 --> 09:07.385
who they'll assume are
responsible for his death.

09:07.391 --> 09:09.992
Could lead to more violence,
both here and in Turkey.

09:09.998 --> 09:11.879
Well, Hasan did say Dogan deserved it.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.289
Yeah, but it doesn't
mean he killed him.

09:13.295 --> 09:14.866
Either way, we need
to find out who did.

09:14.868 --> 09:16.144
So, what's our next move?

09:16.150 --> 09:17.980
I have a thought on that.

09:19.906 --> 09:21.672
Well, don't look so surprised.

09:21.674 --> 09:23.841
All right, uh, I-I, uh,
got into Dogan's phone.

09:23.843 --> 09:25.109
I did a little digging around.

09:25.111 --> 09:26.711
Turned up a bunch of text messages,

09:26.713 --> 09:29.347
one of 'em from some guy
calling himself CT69.

09:29.349 --> 09:31.015
There's a reference to "new merch."

09:31.017 --> 09:34.252
There's a link to an escort
service on the dark web.

09:35.989 --> 09:37.666
Escorts?

09:38.525 --> 09:41.021
Some of these girls barely
look old enough to vote.

09:41.027 --> 09:43.628
Yeah, well, that's the point.
Most of them are kids.

09:43.630 --> 09:46.297
Likely trafficked here
for sex. Who sent this?

09:46.299 --> 09:47.899
I don't know. They used
an email-to-text app

09:47.901 --> 09:49.333
to mask their identity,

09:49.335 --> 09:51.168
but I... I'm assuming it's the pimp.

09:51.170 --> 09:53.337
I mean, per this text, it
was probably the blonde

09:53.339 --> 09:54.505
and the pimp who rolled Dogan.

09:54.507 --> 09:56.007
Or if not, maybe they know who did.

09:56.009 --> 09:58.109
We need to get to them.

09:58.111 --> 10:00.611
Fastest way to a pimp is
through his wallet, right?

10:00.613 --> 10:03.447
- What are you doing?
- Making a date.

10:05.251 --> 10:07.980
- Good work.
- _

10:07.986 --> 10:10.320
All of these girls
have the same tattoo.

10:10.556 --> 10:12.673
Those aren't tattoos. They're brands.

10:24.504 --> 10:27.038
- Busy day.
- Yeah.

10:29.008 --> 10:30.539
You all right...

10:31.102 --> 10:33.110
With this case?

10:33.112 --> 10:34.875
It's not gonna be a problem.

10:35.899 --> 10:38.382
That's not why I was asking.

10:39.852 --> 10:41.485
I know.

10:42.822 --> 10:44.772
I got a bite.

10:47.560 --> 10:50.461
"He would like to know
what I'm into." Hmm.

10:50.463 --> 10:51.902
Say...

10:53.166 --> 10:55.099
Blonde, white.

10:57.103 --> 10:59.604
Younger the better.

10:59.606 --> 11:01.572
I'm gonna need a shower after this.

11:04.544 --> 11:07.411
_

11:07.413 --> 11:09.155
"I have what you want.

11:09.161 --> 11:11.094
"When? Where?"

11:11.100 --> 11:13.067
_

11:13.073 --> 11:15.119
"9:00, Vista Motel..." Classy guy.

11:15.121 --> 11:17.104
"Room one. $1,000 cash."

11:17.106 --> 11:18.555
Good work.

11:18.561 --> 11:20.294
I just need a john now.

11:25.698 --> 11:28.332
- Serious?
- You have the right look.

11:28.334 --> 11:30.751
And what look is that?
The I-have-to-pay-for-it look?

11:30.753 --> 11:33.237
No, the I'm-not-law-enforcement look.

11:34.841 --> 11:36.641
Yeah, okay.

11:39.579 --> 11:41.312
How you doing, Kilroy?

11:41.314 --> 11:42.647
Me? Um, no, good. Never better.

11:42.649 --> 11:43.914
Will you please relax?

11:43.916 --> 11:45.516
I'm rela... Why don't you relax, okay?

11:45.518 --> 11:47.551
You're not the one who's
gonna get shived out here.

11:47.553 --> 11:49.804
No one is gonna get shived.
Just sit down.

11:49.806 --> 11:51.455
What, you want me to
sit down over there?

11:51.457 --> 11:54.258
You realize how many layers
of filth exist in that...

11:54.260 --> 11:56.360
- I don't think about it.
- You should think about it.

11:56.362 --> 11:57.695
- Here, let me... let me...
- Please don't do that.

11:57.697 --> 11:59.563
That's not a good idea. Kilroy...

11:59.565 --> 12:01.165
Oh, for the love of God.

12:01.167 --> 12:02.566
Now I regret doing that.

12:02.568 --> 12:04.435
I told you not to bring
that stupid thing.

12:04.437 --> 12:06.137
I bring it everywhere, okay?

12:06.139 --> 12:07.571
We're standing in a biohazard.

12:07.573 --> 12:09.373
Car coming. It could be our girl.

12:26.626 --> 12:29.694
Okay. Here we go.

12:29.696 --> 12:31.195
It's not what I signed up
for when I took this gig.

12:31.197 --> 12:32.763
- Just relax and be cool.
- You... okay.

12:32.765 --> 12:34.565
You... you relax, you be cool.
All right, I'm cool.

12:41.741 --> 12:43.340
Hi.

12:43.342 --> 12:45.676
- Hey there.
- Come on in.

12:47.847 --> 12:49.647
Um...

12:49.649 --> 12:51.615
Nice to meet you.

12:53.753 --> 12:55.930
You got something to show me?

12:57.094 --> 13:00.024
Oh! Right, yes, sure.

13:00.026 --> 13:02.660
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I have... sorry.

13:02.662 --> 13:04.562
Oh, hey, hey, what are you... Santana.

13:04.564 --> 13:06.330
What are you... What are you doing?

13:06.332 --> 13:08.032
Hey, hey, hey.

13:08.034 --> 13:09.366
Easy. I'm not gonna hurt you.

13:09.368 --> 13:11.902
I didn't do anything.
We were just talking.

13:11.904 --> 13:14.155
Relax. We're not the cops.

13:14.157 --> 13:16.474
- What do you want?
- Just to talk.

13:18.144 --> 13:19.727
Okay?

13:19.729 --> 13:21.454
What's your name?

13:21.914 --> 13:23.247
Lucia.

13:23.249 --> 13:25.216
Lucia, do you know this girl?

13:27.887 --> 13:29.520
Her name is Ava.

13:29.522 --> 13:31.572
Do you know where we can find her?

13:31.574 --> 13:33.791
No. She hasn't been around.

13:33.793 --> 13:35.342
That's why he sent me.

13:35.344 --> 13:37.661
- Who?
- Cesar.

13:37.663 --> 13:39.663
Is he the one in the car?

13:39.665 --> 13:41.832
- No.
- A driver.

13:41.834 --> 13:44.368
Cesar, he's who you and Ava work for?

13:45.872 --> 13:47.338
All right.

13:51.711 --> 13:54.445
Is that Cesar's tattoo?

13:54.447 --> 13:56.714
All of Cesar's girls have them.

13:56.716 --> 13:59.750
I need to check in with
him, or I get in trouble.

13:59.752 --> 14:01.402
How about we take you to him instead?

14:01.404 --> 14:03.220
I don't know.

14:05.174 --> 14:08.125
We just wanna talk with him. Promise.

14:13.232 --> 14:14.865
This is the place.

14:14.867 --> 14:16.746
I'll check it out.

14:17.170 --> 14:19.003
You stay here with her.

14:51.370 --> 14:53.771
I don't think Cesar's gonna
be branding anymore girls.

14:53.773 --> 14:55.539
What do you mean?

14:55.541 --> 14:57.334
He's dead.

15:01.581 --> 15:04.248
Since when does a pimp
not have his phone?

15:05.618 --> 15:07.952
Out back. He's running.

15:07.954 --> 15:09.787
Stay put. It'll be all right, okay?

15:15.828 --> 15:17.962
In the alley, headed to the street!

15:17.964 --> 15:19.597
- Hey!
- Did you see anything?

15:19.599 --> 15:20.881
No!

15:23.536 --> 15:25.502
They just disappeared.

15:27.273 --> 15:28.939
And they weren't the only one.

15:32.511 --> 15:34.545
Damn it.

15:36.313 --> 15:37.871
Pimp's name is Cesar Torres.

15:37.877 --> 15:40.842
Belonged to a gang called
the East Heights Mob.

15:40.848 --> 15:42.830
Uh, known for sex trafficking,

15:42.847 --> 15:44.011
mainly girls from South America,

15:44.017 --> 15:45.201
but it could be from anywhere.

15:45.207 --> 15:46.640
Well, at least Lucia got away.

15:46.708 --> 15:48.575
Or went back to the gang, out of fear.

15:48.644 --> 15:50.410
Cesar carved out a
real niche for himself,

15:50.479 --> 15:52.178
catering to dudes like Dogan,

15:52.247 --> 15:54.514
you know, rich guys with,
uh, particular tastes,

15:54.583 --> 15:56.616
- if you can call them that.
- You mean underage?

15:56.685 --> 15:58.418
Yeah, basically, or looking like it,

15:58.424 --> 15:59.890
and charging a premium.

15:59.896 --> 16:01.929
Okay, so now we have two victims?

16:02.124 --> 16:03.623
Victims?

16:03.629 --> 16:06.446
The only victims are girls
like Ava and Lucia,

16:06.595 --> 16:08.528
trapped and branded by low-life pimps

16:08.597 --> 16:11.932
to be sold to entitled,
protected scumbags like Dogan.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.600
They're not victims,

16:13.669 --> 16:15.201
they're criminals,

16:15.270 --> 16:16.770
and if you ask me, they
got what they deserved.

16:16.838 --> 16:18.672
Straight up.

16:18.740 --> 16:20.206
That may be,

16:20.275 --> 16:23.443
but our job here is to
find Dogan's killer...

16:23.512 --> 16:25.145
Okay?

16:25.213 --> 16:27.280
So we need to stay focused.

16:30.085 --> 16:31.985
I noticed his phone was missing.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.082
You know, it could be the killer

16:33.088 --> 16:34.454
looking for their next target.

16:34.523 --> 16:36.423
Let's try searching
for unsolved murders

16:36.491 --> 16:38.058
that might match the pattern.

16:38.126 --> 16:39.926
It might help us anticipate
their next move.

16:39.995 --> 16:42.762
Maybe Cesar saw the killer
when he brought Ava to Dogan.

16:44.503 --> 16:47.070
- He could've been a witness.
- That would make Ava one too.

16:47.202 --> 16:48.835
We need to keep looking for her.

16:48.904 --> 16:51.019
Okay... but where?

16:51.840 --> 16:53.907
I've got a place in mind.

17:05.230 --> 17:07.230
So, what's your connection here?

17:07.236 --> 17:10.490
Theresa. So nice to see you again.

17:12.527 --> 17:13.819
Been a while.

17:13.825 --> 17:15.662
I know. Work's kept me pretty busy.

17:15.696 --> 17:17.083
I'm sure.

17:17.089 --> 17:18.632
Well, we appreciate any
time you can give us.

17:18.700 --> 17:20.733
Uh, Diane, this is my colleague, Bryan.

17:20.801 --> 17:22.035
Pleasure.

17:22.104 --> 17:24.570
- First time to Promise Road?
- It is.

17:25.037 --> 17:28.070
In fact, Theresa was just
telling me all about it.

17:28.077 --> 17:30.744
Well, why don't I just show you?

17:34.249 --> 17:36.149
We help women out of bad situations,

17:36.218 --> 17:38.818
ones they often can't get
out of on their own.

17:38.887 --> 17:40.587
Like what?

17:40.622 --> 17:42.422
Domestic abuse, sexual assault,

17:42.491 --> 17:45.058
human trafficking, among other things.

17:45.127 --> 17:46.543
Women who too frequently are invisible

17:46.628 --> 17:48.194
to the rest of society.

17:48.263 --> 17:50.363
We provide counseling, rehabilitation,

17:50.432 --> 17:53.967
pro bono legal referrals,
job placements,

17:54.036 --> 17:55.969
but mostly, we offer a safe space

17:56.004 --> 17:58.204
where these women can begin
to rebuild their lives.

17:59.908 --> 18:01.841
That's really impressive.

18:01.910 --> 18:04.173
It's because of
volunteers like Theresa.

18:05.380 --> 18:08.882
Um, actually, today, we're
here looking for someone.

18:08.950 --> 18:10.617
I was wondering if
you've seen this girl.

18:10.652 --> 18:12.369
Her name is Ava.

18:12.454 --> 18:14.054
Yeah, she's been here.

18:14.122 --> 18:16.690
I don't know her well, but
I know someone who does.

18:16.758 --> 18:18.658
Her name is Ava Conrad. Why?

18:18.727 --> 18:20.093
Has something happened to her?

18:20.162 --> 18:21.961
Not that we know of.

18:21.997 --> 18:23.596
We just want to speak with her.

18:23.665 --> 18:26.700
Oh, I haven't seen Ava in weeks.

18:26.785 --> 18:29.502
- She was a client?
- For almost a year.

18:29.554 --> 18:31.588
When I met her, she had
just hit rock bottom.

18:31.673 --> 18:33.506
She had escaped an abusive boyfriend,

18:33.512 --> 18:34.670
who got her hooked on drugs

18:34.676 --> 18:36.743
and forced her into prostitution.

18:36.812 --> 18:38.712
- How'd she do here?
- Good.

18:38.780 --> 18:41.314
I mean, there were anger
and trust issues,

18:41.383 --> 18:43.817
but with time and help,
she was turning it around.

18:43.885 --> 18:45.485
She got clean.

18:45.520 --> 18:47.787
She got a job, got an apartment.

18:47.856 --> 18:49.189
She even reached out to her father,

18:49.257 --> 18:50.557
who was desperate to hear from her.

18:50.625 --> 18:52.040
Her father?

18:53.128 --> 18:55.028
Is he in town?

18:55.097 --> 18:56.440
I don't know.

18:56.596 --> 18:58.331
You said you haven't seen her.

18:58.400 --> 18:59.766
- What... what happened?
- She slipped.

18:59.835 --> 19:01.634
Got arrested buying drugs.

19:01.703 --> 19:03.169
Lost her job.

19:03.238 --> 19:04.871
That's when she stopped coming here.

19:04.940 --> 19:07.173
You, uh... you mentioned
she had an apartment.

19:07.242 --> 19:09.008
You don't happen to have
the address, do you?

19:09.077 --> 19:10.577
Sure.

19:10.645 --> 19:12.445
Truth is...

19:12.514 --> 19:14.114
Getting our women out of trouble

19:14.182 --> 19:15.915
is only half the battle.

19:15.984 --> 19:19.119
For many, it's the road back
that's the hardest part.

19:22.340 --> 19:24.224
If you find her,

19:24.292 --> 19:25.792
please tell her we're here for her.

19:25.861 --> 19:28.094
We will. Meg, thank you
so much for your time.

19:28.130 --> 19:29.896
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

19:33.068 --> 19:36.169
It may be just me, but I feel
this case has struck a nerve.

19:36.238 --> 19:38.167
Is there something you wanna talk about?

19:38.269 --> 19:39.769
Honestly, I just wanna find Ava

19:39.775 --> 19:41.841
and wrap this thing up, okay?

19:46.031 --> 19:47.781
She's two months behind.

19:47.849 --> 19:49.766
I tried serving an eviction notice,

19:49.851 --> 19:51.618
and she's never here.

19:51.686 --> 19:54.504
Like I need another
deadbeat to deal with.

19:56.491 --> 19:58.291
Here...

19:58.360 --> 20:00.293
This should buy her
another couple weeks.

20:00.378 --> 20:02.462
And us a little privacy.

20:02.531 --> 20:04.197
It's your dime.

20:16.344 --> 20:18.228
Looks like she left in a hurry.

20:19.414 --> 20:21.214
And hasn't been back.

20:35.330 --> 20:38.298
She didn't pack anything.

20:38.350 --> 20:40.300
She probably didn't have a chance.

20:42.337 --> 20:45.300
Most traffic girls are
kept under lock and key.

20:45.536 --> 20:47.403
Cesar would've taken her somewhere else.

21:02.073 --> 21:04.034
Hold it.

21:04.543 --> 21:06.645
Hands where I can see 'em.

21:07.529 --> 21:10.033
You boys wanna tell me
what you're doing here?

21:47.122 --> 21:49.656
I recognized that guy.

21:49.804 --> 21:51.204
They were from the Embassy.

21:51.273 --> 21:53.829
- What are they doing here?
- I don't know.

21:53.835 --> 21:55.341
But one thing's for sure:

21:55.377 --> 21:57.043
We better find Ava before they do.

21:59.563 --> 22:01.308
You're sure they were from the Embassy?

22:01.314 --> 22:02.514
Positive.

22:02.582 --> 22:04.282
Somehow they'd found out about Ava.

22:04.351 --> 22:06.998
Maybe they knew about Dogan's
extra-curricular activities.

22:07.004 --> 22:09.454
Then that would mean they'd
know about Cesar and Ava.

22:09.819 --> 22:12.304
Well, their ruling party
has already survived a coup

22:12.310 --> 22:14.343
and faced condemnation
for cracking down on

22:14.412 --> 22:15.711
dissenters like Hasan.

22:15.780 --> 22:18.147
The last thing they need
hitting the news cycle

22:18.216 --> 22:19.649
is that their diplomat
is in the habit of

22:19.654 --> 22:21.661
buying young trafficked girls.

22:21.667 --> 22:23.901
If Hasan knew about
Dogan and the girls,

22:24.061 --> 22:27.262
maybe he saw this as a chance
to expose or eliminate 'em,

22:27.298 --> 22:28.997
cause a scandal for the ruling party.

22:29.003 --> 22:30.636
The Embassy is trying to clean it up.

22:30.642 --> 22:32.475
They're trying to erase
that part of Dogan's life.

22:32.481 --> 22:33.947
Yeah, it's a cover-up.

22:34.228 --> 22:35.962
They wanna make sure Ava disappears.

22:35.969 --> 22:37.702
Well, we need to get to her first.

22:37.771 --> 22:38.904
But how?

22:38.910 --> 22:41.044
We have no idea where she could be.

22:41.174 --> 22:42.526
I might.

22:44.811 --> 22:46.278
Nah, I'm good.

22:46.346 --> 22:48.013
What do you mean?

22:48.081 --> 22:49.514
I mean I don't need you to come.

22:49.583 --> 22:51.816
Hey... is there a problem?

22:51.885 --> 22:53.618
I said I'm good.

22:56.423 --> 22:58.189
Just leave her be.

23:09.503 --> 23:11.202
Nice night.

23:12.873 --> 23:14.539
- You scared me.
- Sorry.

23:16.143 --> 23:18.243
- Can I help you?
- Maybe.

23:18.312 --> 23:20.931
Actually, I'm hoping
that you can help Ava.

23:20.974 --> 23:22.374
How?

23:22.407 --> 23:24.149
I told you, I-I haven't seen her.

23:24.184 --> 23:27.052
I know, but Ava's in a lot of danger,

23:27.120 --> 23:29.754
and she probably doesn't know that.

23:29.823 --> 23:32.123
I just... I don't know why
you're telling me this.

23:32.192 --> 23:34.659
Because I remember that you
found her at her lowest point,

23:34.728 --> 23:35.894
when she had no one,

23:35.963 --> 23:37.429
and it's not a stretch to think

23:37.497 --> 23:40.131
that she might wanna find
that safe space again.

23:40.200 --> 23:43.270
Well, if she does, I will let you know.

23:43.276 --> 23:44.740
Yeah, I noticed that you bought

23:44.746 --> 23:46.771
some hair dye at the drugstore.

23:46.840 --> 23:48.440
It's not really your shade, though.

23:50.744 --> 23:52.811
I can help her, Meg.

24:06.426 --> 24:08.076
Who are you?

24:08.161 --> 24:10.078
Someone who wants to help.

24:14.401 --> 24:16.334
I advised the Director about

24:16.403 --> 24:18.103
the security agents at the Embassy.

24:18.171 --> 24:19.924
He said not to confront them.

24:19.930 --> 24:21.406
He doesn't wanna risk this becoming

24:21.412 --> 24:23.812
an international incident.

24:23.944 --> 24:26.978
- Any word from Santana?
- No, not yet.

24:27.047 --> 24:29.781
Look, I don't know
what's going on with her,

24:29.850 --> 24:31.716
or why she's shutting me out.

24:31.785 --> 24:33.218
This has nothing to do with you.

24:33.286 --> 24:35.383
Well, what does it have to do with?

24:36.323 --> 24:38.089
You know what, fine,

24:38.095 --> 24:40.121
but I don't know how you
expect this team to function

24:40.127 --> 24:42.093
if we can't even talk to each other.

24:42.162 --> 24:43.962
Mills...

24:43.997 --> 24:45.586
What?

24:47.267 --> 24:50.274
Has she ever talked to you
about her time in the army?

24:51.471 --> 24:54.472
Or about how she and I met?

24:54.541 --> 24:55.657
No.

24:59.680 --> 25:02.080
I was with him that night at the motel.

25:05.585 --> 25:07.635
Is Dogan the one who did that to you?

25:11.324 --> 25:14.092
And did you do anything to him?

25:14.161 --> 25:15.422
No.

25:16.167 --> 25:18.767
I got dressed, and I left.

25:18.773 --> 25:20.361
I was with another date yesterday

25:20.367 --> 25:23.101
when I heard he got killed.
I panicked, and I ran.

25:23.170 --> 25:25.047
And Cesar?

25:25.572 --> 25:27.839
I don't know what happened to him.

25:27.845 --> 25:29.250
Okay.

25:30.043 --> 25:32.610
Ava... we need to go to the police

25:32.679 --> 25:34.646
and tell them what you just told me.

25:34.715 --> 25:37.015
- The police?
- Yeah.

25:37.084 --> 25:38.750
They can't do anything for me.

25:38.756 --> 25:40.158
Why not?

25:40.174 --> 25:42.026
Because Cesar used to brag that he would

25:42.032 --> 25:44.160
make us disappear if we
ever tried to leave,

25:44.241 --> 25:46.858
because he and his guys
are protected by a cop.

25:46.927 --> 25:48.660
A cop?

25:48.729 --> 25:50.462
Yeah, that's how I met Cesar.

25:50.530 --> 25:52.597
He took me to him after
I got out of jail.

25:52.666 --> 25:54.733
This cop, you remember his name?

25:56.536 --> 25:58.970
Once, I heard Cesar call him...

25:59.039 --> 26:00.919
Lyons.

26:01.742 --> 26:03.427
Lyons?

26:04.177 --> 26:05.744
As in Detective Lyons?

26:13.086 --> 26:15.366
Okay, listen, Ava...

26:16.289 --> 26:19.357
you are in very real danger,

26:19.426 --> 26:21.359
and I need you to come with me.

26:26.036 --> 26:28.637
Santana was working in Iraq with JASOC,

26:28.769 --> 26:31.369
providing arms for
counter-insurgency forces,

26:31.421 --> 26:33.738
as part of a CIA program.

26:33.807 --> 26:36.174
But then, NSC imposed a cease-fire.

26:36.243 --> 26:38.076
We stopped distributing the weapons,

26:38.145 --> 26:39.677
and the insurgents returned.

26:39.746 --> 26:40.945
Yeah, I remember.

26:41.014 --> 26:42.747
They recaptured many of the villagers.

26:42.816 --> 26:46.117
Yeah, they executed
the men and the boys,

26:46.186 --> 26:48.386
and they raped and kidnapped the girls

26:48.455 --> 26:50.855
to sell into the sex trade.

26:50.924 --> 26:53.958
Santana came across one such group:

26:54.027 --> 26:56.318
captured Yazidi girls.

26:56.802 --> 26:59.002
Some of them were just children.

27:01.268 --> 27:03.001
Santana decided she had to

27:03.007 --> 27:05.115
do something about it, so...

27:05.839 --> 27:07.705
she cut a deal with the insurgents.

27:09.442 --> 27:10.820
Arms for the girls.

27:10.826 --> 27:12.292
Mm-hmm.

27:12.712 --> 27:14.279
It didn't take JASOC long

27:14.347 --> 27:16.080
to figure out what she had done.

27:16.149 --> 27:19.184
When I heard about it, she
was facing a court-martial.

27:21.555 --> 27:23.855
Women have always had to deal with

27:23.924 --> 27:26.763
rampant harassment, sexism,

27:26.769 --> 27:28.927
and Santana was no different.

27:28.995 --> 27:31.196
I mean, her superiors saw her actions as

27:31.264 --> 27:33.798
reckless, emotional,

27:33.867 --> 27:35.549
and without merit.

27:36.703 --> 27:38.269
I didn't.

27:38.338 --> 27:39.754
So, what did you do?

27:39.760 --> 27:41.144
Called in a few favors.

27:41.208 --> 27:44.042
Instead of a court-martial,
she got a letter of reprimand

27:44.110 --> 27:45.977
and an Other-Than-Honorable discharge,

27:46.046 --> 27:47.812
but still, it cost her her career.

27:49.282 --> 27:51.382
Almost her freedom.

27:51.388 --> 27:55.390
And I have no doubt she
would do it all over again.

28:01.795 --> 28:04.662
It's... it's okay. I got you.

28:14.174 --> 28:17.242
Everyone, this is Ava.

28:19.087 --> 28:20.411
How did you find her?

28:20.417 --> 28:22.060
I just knew where to look.

28:22.249 --> 28:25.016
She admits that she was
at the motel with Dogan

28:25.085 --> 28:27.151
the night that he was murdered, but...

28:27.220 --> 28:30.288
She says she had nothing to do
with it, and I believe her.

28:30.357 --> 28:32.423
Do you know who might have?

28:32.492 --> 28:34.192
No.

28:34.261 --> 28:36.327
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

28:36.396 --> 28:37.996
Back to square one.

28:38.002 --> 28:40.069
Or maybe not. Check this out, come here.

28:40.200 --> 28:43.001
Five years ago, there
was a sex trafficker.

28:43.069 --> 28:44.552
He was holding three
girls in his apartment,

28:44.638 --> 28:45.770
when the police caught him.

28:45.839 --> 28:47.171
He walked on a technicality.

28:47.240 --> 28:48.907
Yeah, but he didn't get far.

28:48.975 --> 28:51.242
About three months later,
he was found in a vacant lot,

28:51.311 --> 28:53.544
beaten, drugged, and, uh, castrated.

28:53.613 --> 28:55.046
Case is still cold.

28:55.115 --> 28:56.948
Who were the women he
held captive, does it say?

28:57.017 --> 28:58.650
Two women from South America,

28:58.656 --> 29:00.666
one women from Virginia named...

29:00.672 --> 29:02.258
Megan Chandler.

29:02.264 --> 29:04.352
- Chandler?
- Meg?

29:04.824 --> 29:06.324
From the shelter.

29:08.712 --> 29:11.429
She's not only counseling
trafficking survivors.

29:11.481 --> 29:12.847
She is one.

29:12.933 --> 29:14.515
Meg was looking for Ava.

29:14.601 --> 29:17.135
She could've found her,
followed her to the motel,

29:17.141 --> 29:20.409
saw her with Dogan... getting rough.

29:20.540 --> 29:22.140
And attacked him after she left.

29:22.208 --> 29:23.574
But how did she find Cesar?

29:23.643 --> 29:25.476
From me.

29:25.545 --> 29:27.312
When I ran to her place,

29:27.318 --> 29:30.419
I told her that Cesar would
be angry and looking for me.

29:30.550 --> 29:32.283
I told her about his shop.

29:32.352 --> 29:34.052
So, other than a PR nightmare,

29:34.120 --> 29:36.421
this has nothing to do with the Embassy.

29:36.489 --> 29:38.222
This is about a vigilante.

29:38.291 --> 29:40.191
And a dirty cop.

29:40.260 --> 29:41.826
Detective Lyons.

29:41.895 --> 29:43.795
Wait, Lyons? Are you sure?

29:43.801 --> 29:46.287
Ava said that Cesar
was working for him,

29:46.890 --> 29:48.523
and now Meg knows that too.

29:48.835 --> 29:50.635
We need to stop her.

30:01.848 --> 30:03.414
I don't think so, bitch.

30:05.679 --> 30:07.659
Ava, can you tell us where
you and the other girls

30:07.665 --> 30:09.364
were being held when
you weren't working?

30:09.370 --> 30:10.769
I'm not sure.

30:10.838 --> 30:12.604
Cesar always took different
ways to get there.

30:13.250 --> 30:15.050
You remember what type of place?

30:15.229 --> 30:17.476
Uh, an apartment, hotel?

30:18.029 --> 30:19.812
- A warehouse.
- Oh, yeah?

30:19.964 --> 30:22.131
You think you'd know it if you saw it?

30:22.199 --> 30:23.732
I don't think I could forget it.

30:23.801 --> 30:25.167
All right, let's take a look.

30:25.202 --> 30:28.070
- Did you find her?
- No, she's already gone.

30:31.542 --> 30:33.475
Clozapine.

30:33.544 --> 30:34.944
That's an antipsychotic.

30:35.012 --> 30:36.533
She's been crushing the pills.

30:36.539 --> 30:38.088
That makes them ejectable.

30:38.094 --> 30:40.342
- That's how she's drugging them.
- There's no syringe?

30:40.348 --> 30:42.484
No, she probably has it on her,

30:42.490 --> 30:44.425
along with a dose for Lyons.

30:45.523 --> 30:47.656
Has Ava managed to
give you a location yet?

30:47.662 --> 30:49.228
We're working on it.

30:52.630 --> 30:54.964
Does anything seem familiar?

30:55.032 --> 30:56.932
- No.
- What about sounds?

30:57.001 --> 30:59.335
Uh, do... do you remember
anything in particular

30:59.403 --> 31:01.904
you might have heard
or remember hearing?

31:01.939 --> 31:04.139
- Just traffic.
- Yeah?

31:04.145 --> 31:07.179
Like, um, start-stop or steady?

31:07.185 --> 31:08.535
Steady.

31:09.347 --> 31:11.130
All right, maybe near a freeway.

31:16.420 --> 31:18.520
Wait. Go back.

31:20.374 --> 31:21.991
That building with the pointed roof,

31:22.059 --> 31:23.592
I see it every time they take us back.

31:23.661 --> 31:26.328
- The tower, are you sure?
- Yeah.

31:26.397 --> 31:29.465
Okay, there's an industrial
park near the Capital Beltway.

31:29.500 --> 31:32.101
It's near Hillcrest Heights.
Look for the tower.

31:32.169 --> 31:33.986
- We'll find it.
- Let's go.

32:13.110 --> 32:15.484
Got a little present for ya.

32:15.860 --> 32:17.198
Who's she?

32:17.394 --> 32:18.911
She's the one that killed the Turk

32:19.253 --> 32:21.086
and your boy, Cesar.

32:21.469 --> 32:23.919
I think she had the same
thing in mind for me.

32:26.057 --> 32:27.990
Don't leave a trace.

32:27.996 --> 32:29.668
No problem.

32:30.594 --> 32:32.728
No!

32:52.183 --> 32:54.283
I got this! Go find Meg!

33:10.067 --> 33:12.201
Don't you hate that?

33:24.849 --> 33:25.914
Really?

33:45.512 --> 33:46.978
Meg?

33:49.740 --> 33:50.806
Are you all right?

33:50.875 --> 33:52.808
She's gonna finish it.

33:52.877 --> 33:54.510
Finish what?

33:54.516 --> 33:56.450
What I came here to do.

34:03.454 --> 34:05.420
Stop right there!

34:05.489 --> 34:07.389
Oh, please do it.

34:12.696 --> 34:14.329
Oh, good, it's you.

34:14.335 --> 34:16.324
Looks like we were both
right about this place.

34:16.330 --> 34:18.081
You mean about you running it?

34:23.257 --> 34:25.474
Well, that's some decent detective work.

34:25.543 --> 34:27.643
But the last I checked, you're no cop,

34:27.710 --> 34:29.578
so you can't arrest me.

34:29.647 --> 34:33.248
No... but I have no
intention of arresting you.

34:40.510 --> 34:43.378
Santana.

34:43.473 --> 34:45.072
You got him.

34:45.141 --> 34:46.908
Good job.

34:46.976 --> 34:49.043
- And the girls?
- They're safe.

34:49.112 --> 34:52.045
Good, that leaves just one
last thing to take care of.

34:52.114 --> 34:55.356
- No, you gotta stop her... now!
- Do I?

34:55.362 --> 34:56.750
Yeah, I'm pretty sure the only one

34:56.755 --> 34:59.056
that needs to be stopped
out here is you.

35:00.560 --> 35:02.860
I know about Iraq...

35:02.929 --> 35:04.361
and the girls you saved.

35:04.430 --> 35:06.135
Saved?

35:06.699 --> 35:08.065
Wow.

35:08.134 --> 35:10.134
You must not have the whole story.

35:10.186 --> 35:13.721
I didn't save anyone, Mills.

35:13.806 --> 35:15.406
Those girls

35:15.474 --> 35:18.375
that I turned over to the Iraqi police,

35:18.444 --> 35:20.144
one week later, those same police

35:20.196 --> 35:22.313
sold them back to their captors,

35:22.381 --> 35:25.916
so what I did made no difference at all.

35:25.985 --> 35:27.785
And he's the same.

35:27.853 --> 35:29.853
Just a different uniform.

35:29.922 --> 35:31.088
As long as there are men

35:31.157 --> 35:32.590
willing to buy women and children,

35:32.658 --> 35:36.260
there will be men trying to
sell them. It never changes.

35:36.329 --> 35:37.695
Meg saw that too,

35:37.763 --> 35:38.996
so she decided to break the cycle

35:39.065 --> 35:42.733
by getting rid of men
like Dogan... and you.

35:42.802 --> 35:44.735
- You can't kill a cop.
- You stopped being a cop

35:44.741 --> 35:46.641
the moment you went into
business with Cesar.

35:46.772 --> 35:48.906
Yeah, but he's still got that badge,

35:48.975 --> 35:51.933
and I'm not gonna let him
use it to get out of this.

35:52.745 --> 35:54.511
You gotta know, whatever
you choose to do,

35:54.580 --> 35:57.915
I got your back. But executing him...

35:57.984 --> 35:59.617
That ain't gonna change
anything out here.

35:59.685 --> 36:00.918
It's just gonna change you.

36:00.987 --> 36:03.028
Then what would you suggest I do?

36:04.457 --> 36:07.491
Same as Dogan and Cesar:

36:07.560 --> 36:09.627
punishment that fits the crime.

36:12.632 --> 36:14.398
- You there?
- I'm always here.

36:14.467 --> 36:15.733
You find what we're looking for?

36:15.801 --> 36:17.623
And then some. Lyons made dozens

36:17.629 --> 36:19.508
of cash deposits under the IRS,

36:19.572 --> 36:21.655
reporting him out of, uh, 10 grand.

36:21.741 --> 36:23.274
Transferred it all to an account

36:23.342 --> 36:24.575
in the Cayman Islands,

36:24.644 --> 36:26.310
that and a 34-foot boat in the Keys.

36:26.379 --> 36:28.145
Good luck explaining that one, pal.

36:28.214 --> 36:29.413
We found the money.

36:29.482 --> 36:30.614
That and the testimony of the girls

36:30.683 --> 36:32.216
and any gang members
who wanna cut a deal

36:32.285 --> 36:33.984
will be enough to put him away.

36:34.053 --> 36:35.552
A former cop,

36:35.558 --> 36:38.399
he's gonna be wishing every
day you had killed him.

36:39.558 --> 36:41.258
Maybe not.

36:43.195 --> 36:45.062
But I kill you,

36:45.131 --> 36:47.898
and you're just another victim,

36:47.967 --> 36:51.590
and I would rather expose you
for what you really are.

37:07.086 --> 37:08.702
For what it's worth,

37:08.788 --> 37:11.989
you did the right thing
for those girls in Iraq.

37:12.213 --> 37:15.375
Yeah, well... the right thing
doesn't always win the day.

37:15.381 --> 37:16.927
It did today.

37:20.232 --> 37:23.167
For a second there, I thought
you might actually kill him.

37:33.879 --> 37:35.579
Ms. Hart.

37:35.614 --> 37:37.014
- Thank you for waiting.
- Not at all.

37:37.066 --> 37:38.632
The Ambassador would like
to extend his gratitude

37:38.718 --> 37:40.200
to you and your people

37:40.286 --> 37:41.635
for your diligent investigation

37:41.721 --> 37:43.654
regarding the circumstances
of Mr. Dogan's murder.

37:43.723 --> 37:47.374
Mm, and what are those
circumstances officially?

37:47.460 --> 37:48.859
The police concluded he was killed

37:48.894 --> 37:51.228
as a result of a robbery
attempt gone horribly wrong.

37:51.297 --> 37:52.396
As opposed to being involved in

37:52.465 --> 37:54.372
a sordid sex trafficking ring?

37:55.868 --> 37:57.701
You all knew very well

37:57.770 --> 38:00.270
what he was up to, didn't you?

38:00.339 --> 38:02.106
And you chose to ignore it.

38:02.174 --> 38:03.707
Ms. Hart, I'm sure you can appreciate

38:03.776 --> 38:06.470
the delicate hand this situation
has required us to...

38:06.476 --> 38:08.210
Oh, I do, I do.

38:08.447 --> 38:10.447
Though your security forces
were anything but delicate

38:10.516 --> 38:12.015
when they shot at my team,

38:12.084 --> 38:13.484
while in pursuit of an innocent girl.

38:13.552 --> 38:15.919
Yes, that was an
unfortunate misunderstanding

38:15.988 --> 38:17.221
that we deeply regret.

38:17.289 --> 38:20.364
Let me be perfectly clear, Mr. Kasim.

38:21.327 --> 38:23.761
If there are anymore misunderstandings

38:23.829 --> 38:26.497
involving your security
forces while on U.S. soil,

38:26.565 --> 38:29.466
rest assured, the full details

38:29.535 --> 38:31.835
of Major Dogan's illegal activities

38:31.904 --> 38:33.303
and your knowledge of them

38:33.339 --> 38:37.141
will be released to the
press, diplomacy be damned.

38:40.279 --> 38:42.913
Do we understand each other?

38:44.717 --> 38:47.067
Give my best to the Ambassador.

38:58.564 --> 38:59.813
I can't believe the police are saying

38:59.899 --> 39:01.698
that Dogan was killed by a mugger.

39:01.784 --> 39:04.468
Yeah, after a little pressure
from the State Department.

39:04.503 --> 39:06.022
That's unbelievable.

39:06.028 --> 39:08.038
People wonder why things
in this town don't change.

39:08.107 --> 39:09.907
You're right, it's
actually totally believable.

39:09.942 --> 39:12.543
Does that mean Meg won't be
charged with Dogan's murder?

39:12.611 --> 39:15.512
Yes, but she will be
charged with Cesar's,

39:15.581 --> 39:17.815
will likely serve out any
sentence she receives

39:17.883 --> 39:19.383
in the psychiatric ward.

39:19.452 --> 39:21.118
What about Lyons?

39:21.187 --> 39:23.253
He's facing multiple
charges of sex trafficking,

39:23.322 --> 39:25.322
kidnapping, attempted murder.

39:25.391 --> 39:27.291
We'll put him away for
the rest of his life.

39:29.528 --> 39:31.328
Well, I'm gonna go, uh,

39:31.397 --> 39:32.946
try and do something a
little more uplifting.

39:33.032 --> 39:36.083
There's a "Texas Chain
Saw Massacre" marathon

39:36.168 --> 39:37.401
down at the Bijou.

39:37.453 --> 39:39.169
Cheer me up.

39:39.238 --> 39:42.573
I gotta... be somewhere as well, so...

39:45.644 --> 39:46.927
You wanna join?

39:51.050 --> 39:52.900
Uh, sure.
