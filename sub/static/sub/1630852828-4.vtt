WEBVTT

00:06.080 --> 00:10.920
NETFLIX PRESENTS

01:45.640 --> 01:47.960
So, tell me, how did it all start?

01:49.040 --> 01:53.520
So, about 20 years ago…

01:54.080 --> 01:55.560
Yeah, more or less.

02:04.640 --> 02:08.080
-What a nice rally.
-This fucking thing won't start moving.

02:08.840 --> 02:10.360
Teresinha, stop it.

02:10.920 --> 02:14.840
Montevelho, I'm thinking
about running for the parish council.

02:14.920 --> 02:18.040
Hey, that's funny!
We both had the same idea, Capristano.

02:18.880 --> 02:20.720
-You could be my vice.
-No.

02:20.800 --> 02:24.480
You're not getting it.
I thought about running for president

02:24.560 --> 02:26.440
and inviting you to be my vice.

02:27.120 --> 02:28.000
Ricardo,

02:29.960 --> 02:31.520
do you dye your hair?

02:31.600 --> 02:33.000
Are you stupid or what?

02:35.080 --> 02:37.280
You dye your hair!

02:37.360 --> 02:40.360
Look at you with that receding hairline
starting to show on your forehead.

02:40.440 --> 02:41.800
Get off your high horse.

02:41.880 --> 02:43.840
You wouldn't dare!

02:44.480 --> 02:47.000
The bigger they are, the harder they fall.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.200
And you cut the relationship off
because of that?

02:57.280 --> 03:00.680
My father left the party
and ran against Ricardo's father,

03:00.760 --> 03:05.000
once for the parish council
and twice for the town council.

03:06.280 --> 03:08.400
-Always lost.
-Yeah.

03:08.480 --> 03:09.880
<i>You know your life.</i>

03:09.960 --> 03:14.080
I don't mean to pry,
but you're not getting any younger.

03:15.120 --> 03:17.840
And Juvenal has always been nice to me.

03:18.840 --> 03:21.040
He's even passed his exams to be a judge.

03:21.920 --> 03:24.240
And he's already paid
the down payment for a flat.

03:24.320 --> 03:28.120
And I could stay and wash the laundry
in the tank when he goes to hunt mammoths.

03:28.760 --> 03:31.880
You must spend your life sitting down.

03:31.960 --> 03:35.520
You must give me grandchildren.
I don't want to be a senile grandfather.

03:36.600 --> 03:38.640
An old fuddy-duddy, God forbid!

03:38.720 --> 03:41.320
I can always do artificial insemination.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.680
Or adopt an Asian baby.

03:48.320 --> 03:49.920
<i>Voilà!</i>

03:52.080 --> 03:53.560
Capristano.

03:54.720 --> 03:57.920
DO YOU TRUST THIS MAN?

04:01.000 --> 04:04.080
Porfírio called me. He said there's a…

04:04.760 --> 04:09.600
There's an opening at the firm.
I thought it was a good chance for me to--

04:09.680 --> 04:11.280
You have the heater on?

04:13.120 --> 04:15.040
But as this is your last…

04:16.720 --> 04:20.360
As it's your last campaign, I thought
it might be the last one for me too.

04:20.440 --> 04:22.040
Who says it's the last campaign?

04:22.800 --> 04:25.080
-Next year, there's the parliamentary one.
-You promised--

04:25.160 --> 04:27.320
Stop the car! Stop it!

04:41.440 --> 04:42.880
Montevelho…

04:46.000 --> 04:48.480
A fight about hair?

04:49.080 --> 04:51.040
No, it's more of a political rivalry.

04:51.560 --> 04:56.080
I'm sorry, but even a fool
couldn't come up with that idea.

05:04.560 --> 05:07.960
-It didn't sound good?
-Don't worry, you're not the first one.

05:09.080 --> 05:10.400
Okay, great!

05:11.240 --> 05:15.400
So you could say that you started dating
because of your parents.

05:16.280 --> 05:17.240
Well…

05:18.400 --> 05:24.320
-Yeah. It makes sense. I think that…
-I never thought of that. Maybe it was.

05:25.280 --> 05:29.720
Hi, my name is Ricardo, and…

05:31.920 --> 05:32.880
Sorry.

05:44.360 --> 05:46.920
Hi, my name is Ricardo.

05:47.760 --> 05:50.040
I'm the son of a narcissist,

05:50.120 --> 05:53.160
and I haven't argued with my father
in over six months.

05:53.880 --> 05:56.640
-Hi, Ricardo.
-Hi.

06:04.200 --> 06:05.200
Montevelho.

06:07.680 --> 06:08.920
Capristano.

06:16.920 --> 06:22.040
NEVER TAKE YOUR EYES OFF THE TIGER

06:40.920 --> 06:42.040
Trust me, Luísa.

06:43.080 --> 06:44.520
The submarine is coming for us.

06:45.040 --> 06:48.880
-And where are we going, Joaquim?
-We're going to Las Vegas!

06:51.400 --> 06:53.160
We haven't been there in so long.

06:54.640 --> 06:55.760
We're ready.

07:03.960 --> 07:05.000
Luísa.

07:07.920 --> 07:08.960
Luísa.

07:11.640 --> 07:12.680
Luísa.

07:17.200 --> 07:18.200
Luísa!

07:23.720 --> 07:24.720
Luísa.

07:25.720 --> 07:28.520
Have we reached America yet, Joaquim?

07:37.720 --> 07:39.960
-Good morning!
-Good morning.

07:40.040 --> 07:42.040
-Hi, Grandpa, good morning.
-Thank you.

07:42.120 --> 07:44.040
So Grandpa's cleaning at this hour?

07:44.880 --> 07:48.080
Son, your grandpa works for the Americans.

07:48.160 --> 07:49.040
Coffee?

07:49.800 --> 07:51.680
-A short one.
-Like your emotional intelligence.

07:55.520 --> 07:58.600
Grandma, right, tell me something…

07:58.680 --> 08:00.240
A full cup of coffee to go, please.

08:00.320 --> 08:03.200
Is it true that Grandpa
was known as the Tiger of Raia?

08:03.280 --> 08:08.440
Son, he used to run that whole border
from top to bottom.

08:09.440 --> 08:15.080
They paid him to fight
in Salamanca, Cáceres, Ciudad Rodrigo…

08:15.160 --> 08:17.040
The Spaniards loved him!

08:17.800 --> 08:20.800
I would stay here in great distress.

08:20.880 --> 08:23.960
I didn't know he had been a professional.

08:24.040 --> 08:25.360
And a very good one!

08:26.520 --> 08:30.280
Marco, I'll need you
to help me with the groom's father.

08:30.360 --> 08:32.400
You have to be at the florist at 2:00 p.m.

08:35.600 --> 08:38.440
-And no… Did you hear what I said?
-I heard it, Mom.

08:39.000 --> 08:44.560
Don't count on me for anything
on Friday, I'm off-duty.

08:45.640 --> 08:46.880
Good morning!

08:47.960 --> 08:49.880
I signed you up for a speed dating thing.

09:23.600 --> 09:27.320
COLONIAL SHIPPING COMPANY - LISBON

09:28.280 --> 09:30.840
TIGER OF RAIA

09:30.920 --> 09:31.880
May I, Grandma?

09:31.960 --> 09:36.640
Son, so many times
he got home all injured.

09:37.240 --> 09:40.960
Many times, I had to stitch
the cuts on his face myself.

09:46.360 --> 09:49.640
When did Grandpa stop fighting?

09:52.080 --> 09:56.480
Look, son, when he realized
that it hurt me more than it did him.

10:13.720 --> 10:15.480
<i>You haven't been punched since when?</i>

10:16.160 --> 10:18.280
I think Ramalho Eanes was still president.

10:21.880 --> 10:24.880
-Hey!
-Never take your eyes off the tiger!

10:24.960 --> 10:26.920
Never take your eyes off the tiger!

10:27.440 --> 10:28.360
Go!

10:30.240 --> 10:33.480
Go on, attack! Come on, go for it!

10:39.920 --> 10:44.560
<i>The great masters call it</i>
<i>the sweet science.</i>

10:46.200 --> 10:48.160
<i>Boxing is an art.</i>

10:48.240 --> 10:52.360
<i>The dodges, the guard, the distance…</i>

10:53.200 --> 10:56.360
<i>A ballet of metrics and power.</i>

10:57.240 --> 11:01.000
<i>The perfect balance</i>
<i>between hitting and not being hit.</i>

11:01.880 --> 11:05.640
<i>A level of concentration</i>
<i>that can't be reached just with your head,</i>

11:06.160 --> 11:07.720
<i>but with all your body.</i>

11:08.440 --> 11:12.280
<i>That has to be</i>
<i>the first nature of the fighter.</i>

11:24.880 --> 11:28.000
Rocky, never take your eyes off the tiger.

11:29.760 --> 11:31.480
Can you see my middle finger?

11:36.400 --> 11:38.920
The list is already closed,
the bride has chosen everything.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.560
Besides, her father was here yesterday
and paid the bill.

11:42.080 --> 11:45.760
This is a surprise.
Courtesy of the bride's father.

11:48.280 --> 11:52.080
What… What have you got
that's more exotic?

11:53.960 --> 11:54.800
Angélica.

11:55.600 --> 11:59.360
These are very popular,
especially for themed weddings.

11:59.440 --> 12:01.440
We fill them with your choice of petals.

12:02.400 --> 12:04.000
And how does it work?

12:04.080 --> 12:07.560
Oh, the bride and groom
will grab sticks and… destroy them.

12:10.520 --> 12:13.440
-That's a bit violent, isn't it?
-It's a symbolic ritual.

12:13.520 --> 12:14.760
A kind of catharsis.

12:14.840 --> 12:18.240
On such a tense day, it'll be liberating.

12:19.600 --> 12:22.520
-And the sticks, are they included?
-Yes.

12:28.760 --> 12:31.600
A bouquet of white roses
for each lady guest,

12:31.680 --> 12:34.320
three welcome crowns, and two piñatas.

12:34.840 --> 12:36.120
Cash or card?

12:36.200 --> 12:38.040
Good morning, Mr. Capristano,
sorry I'm late.

12:38.560 --> 12:40.640
We deliver the roses and crowns
on the same day,

12:40.720 --> 12:42.200
but you can take the piñatas today.

12:45.080 --> 12:46.200
Keep the change.

12:51.800 --> 12:52.800
Let's go.

12:54.120 --> 12:55.400
Thank you very much.

12:57.160 --> 12:58.920
And how much will that cost me?

12:59.520 --> 13:02.640
It's not a matter of money.

13:03.400 --> 13:07.160
A fireworks show
requires a special permit

13:07.240 --> 13:08.840
because firemen have to be present.

13:08.920 --> 13:12.040
That whole process takes a while.
We don't have time.

13:12.120 --> 13:13.320
What about rockets?

13:14.680 --> 13:16.360
Mr. Capristano, come on--

13:17.560 --> 13:19.320
I don't care about any problems.

13:21.880 --> 13:23.320
Just solutions.

13:33.320 --> 13:34.400
You're kidding me.

13:35.440 --> 13:37.920
Believe me,
it's not as bad as it looks. Really.

13:39.160 --> 13:41.680
When you said speed date,

13:41.760 --> 13:43.720
I thought you wanted me to go with you

13:43.800 --> 13:46.840
to one of those computer nerd conventions.

13:46.920 --> 13:48.600
Computer nerd conventions?

13:49.640 --> 13:54.640
Listen, I don't need a matchmaker.
I can do just fine on my own.

13:55.160 --> 13:59.240
FYI, just the other day someone asked
for my phone number at Jorge's club.

13:59.320 --> 14:02.280
Because when you've got it,
you never lose it, right?

14:02.360 --> 14:04.440
Oh, look who's talking.

14:05.080 --> 14:07.680
I've been thinking
about what Grandpa told me the other day.

14:07.760 --> 14:09.760
About the sweet science of boxing.

14:10.520 --> 14:13.680
That can perfectly apply to love.

14:14.360 --> 14:19.600
Look, the dodges, the distance, the guard.

14:20.080 --> 14:21.680
That's the perfect balance.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.720
Did I ever tell you that you were adopted,

14:25.440 --> 14:29.920
that your birth father is Paulo Coelho
and your mother is Gyro Gearloose?

14:30.000 --> 14:34.560
Love is a metaphor for life.
So is boxing. Think about it.

14:45.160 --> 14:47.560
Anything can be a metaphor for life.

14:48.080 --> 14:50.560
Look, this little tree, for example.

14:51.040 --> 14:54.440
When I bought it,
it was green, bright, exuberant.

14:54.520 --> 14:56.760
And it smelled great!
People would get in the van and say,

14:56.840 --> 14:59.160
"What's going on here?
It smells so good in here!"

14:59.240 --> 15:03.560
And now, look at it.
It's yellow, dull, crumbling…

15:03.640 --> 15:07.080
Nobody looks at it anymore.
It's worthless, it's dead, you know?

15:08.400 --> 15:10.520
There's your life metaphor.

15:10.600 --> 15:12.280
Do you think it's easy for me?

15:12.840 --> 15:15.240
You're not the one getting a divorce.

15:15.320 --> 15:17.280
But it didn't just happen to you.

15:17.880 --> 15:21.320
-You're not a child anymore.
-But I'm still your son, Dad.

15:22.480 --> 15:25.720
I don't want you to pat me on my back.
That's not it.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.800
I just want you to understand
how hard it is for me, it logically is.

15:29.280 --> 15:32.400
But it's a lot harder for me
to see you frozen in time, you know?

15:33.480 --> 15:38.320
Just a few weeks ago,
you said that no decision is irreversible.

15:38.400 --> 15:41.200
-We can always change our minds.
-Okay, but I was wrong.

15:41.680 --> 15:44.400
I'm at a stage
where the learning curve is very fast.

15:51.480 --> 15:54.960
And these two here are also part
of your group of imaginary friends?

16:05.840 --> 16:09.160
The dodges, the guard, and the distance.

16:12.680 --> 16:16.000
Yeah, I still eat meat.

16:16.080 --> 16:19.400
But I only eat beef and meat
from animals raised free-range.

16:20.560 --> 16:22.040
I sort the garbage.

16:22.120 --> 16:24.320
I don't know if it's good,
but I practice boxing.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.280
Twice a week.

16:28.640 --> 16:32.320
I have nothing against the man,
but I never voted for him.

16:34.040 --> 16:39.360
My future ex-sister-in-law's
future husband went to college with him,

16:40.040 --> 16:41.520
but he also didn't vote for him.

16:42.160 --> 16:44.960
I didn't know that about Capricorns.

16:45.680 --> 16:46.720
I'm a Pisces.

16:48.560 --> 16:50.760
It's two fish,
going in opposite directions.

16:52.320 --> 16:54.200
My favorite of the three?

16:54.720 --> 16:57.960
That's a tough one. They're all very good.

16:58.560 --> 17:00.760
Look, I really like Sister Lúcia.

17:01.280 --> 17:03.560
But okay, the other ones are cool too.

17:04.040 --> 17:06.360
But Francisco and Jacinta,

17:07.160 --> 17:09.240
it was a shame they died so young.

17:09.880 --> 17:13.800
They're like the Kurt Cobain
and Janis Joplin of Fátima.

17:17.680 --> 17:20.080
Feels like you're
at a job interview, doesn't it?

17:23.440 --> 17:24.400
It's flat.

17:27.040 --> 17:30.160
I've gotten used to it,
but I still keep turning up.

17:31.240 --> 17:34.040
Once in a while,
I find a specimen like you.

17:36.240 --> 17:37.320
Like me?

17:38.800 --> 17:39.640
Yes.

17:40.520 --> 17:42.880
Someone who's not looking for anything.

17:43.600 --> 17:45.880
Who's here because he's been forced?

17:47.400 --> 17:50.400
I don't want to judge, but this…

17:51.360 --> 17:53.400
There's a bit of desperation in all this.

17:53.480 --> 17:55.760
But that's already judging, isn't it?

17:58.480 --> 18:01.200
This illusion of finding love
in three-minute conversations

18:01.280 --> 18:02.600
is a bit pathetic.

18:02.680 --> 18:06.160
-You're not here looking for love?
-No.

18:08.040 --> 18:09.200
I have a thing.

18:10.520 --> 18:12.640
I like sleeping with older men.

18:13.320 --> 18:14.640
But there's a problem.

18:15.200 --> 18:18.600
I find older guys who like
to go to bed with younger women

18:18.680 --> 18:20.880
more disgusting than attractive.

18:21.800 --> 18:24.560
So, it has to be an older man

18:24.640 --> 18:28.480
who doesn't want to go to bed
with younger women, you know?

18:28.560 --> 18:30.320
A man who doesn't want
anything to do with me.

18:30.800 --> 18:33.960
But if one of them doesn't want it,
the two of them can't do it.

18:36.720 --> 18:37.760
Close your eyes.

18:37.840 --> 18:38.760
For what?

18:39.480 --> 18:42.720
Come on. Thirty seconds
till the bell rings. Close your eyes.

18:47.120 --> 18:49.480
Remember when you were 20 years old.

18:50.840 --> 18:53.320
A summer night when you were 20.

18:54.480 --> 18:58.840
You've had a few drinks
and a girl comes over…

19:00.040 --> 19:02.640
And she says,
"Let's go talk somewhere else."

19:04.280 --> 19:06.440
Just her closeness…

19:09.760 --> 19:12.600
Just her bikini line.

19:14.760 --> 19:19.880
Just the idea of kissing
that white line on her tanned shoulder

19:20.800 --> 19:23.680
is enough to make you feel everything.

19:25.760 --> 19:30.080
Everything only a 20-year-old
can feel on a summer night.

19:33.160 --> 19:36.120
And I'm your time machine.

20:02.120 --> 20:03.040
I'll get going.

20:06.280 --> 20:08.520
You know we can't see
each other again, right?

20:14.440 --> 20:17.280
But… do you know why?

20:18.120 --> 20:19.080
Why?

20:19.600 --> 20:23.680
Because now you're an older man
who likes to go to bed with younger women.

20:26.360 --> 20:27.440
No, I'm not.

20:28.640 --> 20:32.440
Life doesn't go backwards.
It always goes forward.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.120
But thank you for the time travel.

21:13.520 --> 21:17.360
So, your night, was it good?

22:54.040 --> 22:56.200
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

22:57.760 --> 22:58.920
You're up early.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.080
I went to the store.

23:35.520 --> 23:36.400
For me?

23:37.840 --> 23:39.040
Thank you.

23:39.120 --> 23:40.680
Are you sure you don't want it?

23:41.640 --> 23:42.760
I don't need it today.

23:55.200 --> 24:01.240
THIS ONE PUTS MORE WOMEN INTO ORBIT
IN ONE DAY THAN NASA IN A LIFETIME

24:01.320 --> 24:05.320
Go with Mrs. Paixão to the waiting room
while I have a word with her husband.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.200
Did you see, Doctor,

24:22.280 --> 24:24.800
how she was completely lucid?

24:25.760 --> 24:29.600
Sometimes she seems
to be somewhere else, in another time.

24:30.400 --> 24:36.360
She seems to be reliving
a life that never happened.

24:36.960 --> 24:38.200
Mr. Paixão,

24:38.280 --> 24:44.160
this type of condition
appears in very different ways.

24:44.240 --> 24:47.960
Loss of sense of time,
loss of sense of space,

24:48.720 --> 24:50.720
short-term memory lapses.

24:51.240 --> 24:52.200
How long?

24:52.840 --> 24:55.720
We're not talking
about a cancer, Mr. Paixão.

24:56.600 --> 25:02.120
How long until she stops recognizing me?

25:02.880 --> 25:05.680
I don't know. No one knows for sure.

25:06.320 --> 25:08.480
And what do I do if I don't know?

25:09.000 --> 25:10.280
Play along.

25:11.280 --> 25:12.720
And live a lie?

25:14.000 --> 25:15.960
If you believe it's true…

25:17.360 --> 25:20.160
then, it won't be a lie, right?

25:27.280 --> 25:30.120
I'll never forget that weekend.

25:35.720 --> 25:39.520
My husband went to fight
on a Friday in Los Angeles.

25:40.320 --> 25:42.520
I saw your concert in Vegas.

25:43.760 --> 25:45.200
It was on a Saturday.

25:58.600 --> 26:03.840
And when we got
to the hotel room after the fight,

26:05.720 --> 26:12.240
you had two invitations
put under our door.

26:16.840 --> 26:23.200
I'll say it again.
That weekend was unforgettable.

26:35.760 --> 26:37.680
Who were you talking to?

26:37.760 --> 26:38.880
Frank Sinatra.

27:43.360 --> 27:45.000
-Mom?
-Yes.

27:46.080 --> 27:49.440
Mr. Montevelho called and said
he's coming here and wants to talk to you.

27:51.560 --> 27:53.240
Rita, you take care of that.

27:53.320 --> 27:55.800
It's my first night off
since I started menopause.

27:57.640 --> 28:00.800
Mom, just do me a favor
and don't tell your date,

28:00.880 --> 28:02.640
"I'm going through menopause."

28:06.840 --> 28:08.800
-Mom.
-What?

28:10.640 --> 28:12.120
I'm very proud of you.

28:14.840 --> 28:17.600
I hope you haven't put on makeup yet.

28:47.920 --> 28:51.560
Here are the place cards for the tables.
I had to change the header.

28:52.360 --> 28:54.640
But your daughter
had already approved them.

28:55.160 --> 28:58.840
My daughter Teresa is very busy.
Let's not bother her with details.

28:58.920 --> 29:02.120
Mr. Montevelho, brides love details.

29:02.200 --> 29:04.480
The more choices, the better.
It's part of the experience.

29:04.560 --> 29:09.160
It's like riding a roller coaster
during a panic attack

29:09.240 --> 29:12.320
while trying to put together
a thousand-piece puzzle.

29:14.880 --> 29:17.480
Well, I also brought the last payment.

29:19.960 --> 29:22.960
Let's leave my daughter
out of the roller coaster of panic

29:23.040 --> 29:24.040
doing puzzles.

29:36.280 --> 29:39.760
I'll steal the composition Velásquez used
on the painting <i>Las Meninas.</i>

29:49.720 --> 29:50.800
Have you got any wine?

29:53.240 --> 29:54.800
When I draw, I don't drink.

29:57.280 --> 29:59.720
It's not uncommon
for great painters to do self-portraits.

29:59.800 --> 30:04.800
As a matter of fact, Velásquez
used a mirror to paint <i>Las Meninas,</i>

30:05.320 --> 30:08.720
and was brave enough
to paint himself next to the royal family.

30:08.800 --> 30:11.200
So, for me, right now…

30:14.000 --> 30:15.320
you are a princess.

30:17.360 --> 30:18.560
Are you ready?

30:19.720 --> 30:20.640
No.

30:23.360 --> 30:26.680
Come on, Vanessa, it's won't be
the first time I've seen you naked.

30:29.480 --> 30:34.040
Other times,
other circumstances, other bodies.

30:34.120 --> 30:37.920
People don't change,
they reveal themselves.

30:38.000 --> 30:42.680
Come on. We're too old for this shame.

30:46.400 --> 30:48.000
Are you sure you haven't got any wine?

30:49.360 --> 30:51.640
There's a convenience store
around the corner.

31:00.840 --> 31:01.920
It's your turn.

31:13.440 --> 31:15.080
Can you turn the lights down?

31:15.640 --> 31:17.200
Vanessa, for God's sake!

31:17.760 --> 31:21.640
My eyes aren't what they used to be.
If we turn them down, I'll see nothing.

31:22.400 --> 31:24.000
Of course you'll see nothing.

31:24.080 --> 31:27.880
"Convenience store
around the corner"? Really?

31:27.960 --> 31:30.560
"People don't change,
they reveal themselves."

31:31.200 --> 31:33.200
"It won't be the first time
I've seen you naked."

31:35.360 --> 31:38.040
What was that line
from that writer we like?

31:38.560 --> 31:40.480
Can I go to the bathroom first?

31:40.560 --> 31:43.360
It wasn't that, it was something
about the glove and the sleeve.

31:52.840 --> 31:58.600
"Sensuality is the skin glimpsed

31:58.680 --> 32:00.680
between the glove and the sleeve."

32:02.640 --> 32:06.720
So, how do you want Vasco
to glimpse that?

32:08.960 --> 32:10.520
So, this is how it is now?

32:10.600 --> 32:13.080
Don't worry. I've seen you naked too.

32:14.600 --> 32:19.360
Vanessa, tonight,
you're a trophy for seasoned veterans.

32:23.480 --> 32:27.640
You're the missing piece to Vasco's story.

32:28.600 --> 32:31.600
"I painted her the first time
when I was 19 years old,

32:31.680 --> 32:34.040
then I painted her again at 50."

32:35.040 --> 32:40.960
Or the painter's boldness,
nudity as a transgression…

32:42.000 --> 32:43.160
You still fall for that?

32:43.240 --> 32:44.840
What's wrong with that story?

32:44.920 --> 32:47.400
It's his, not yours!

32:47.480 --> 32:52.080
Look, is that a sermon
or is it a motivational speech?

32:52.160 --> 32:55.800
Did you notice
that he hasn't looked at you once?

32:56.920 --> 32:58.240
Of course he did.

32:59.040 --> 33:02.080
Then why are you ashamed
of being naked in front of him?

33:03.520 --> 33:05.640
Look, Vanessa.

33:06.200 --> 33:11.320
Stare like someone who wants to see,
like someone who really wants to.

33:12.760 --> 33:16.120
He could be one of those guys
who would take you

33:16.200 --> 33:18.800
to a motel afterwards with round beds,

33:18.880 --> 33:24.440
and then you'd go to eat greasy toast
at 5:00 a.m. in some trailer.

33:25.440 --> 33:27.800
But wanting it, you know?

33:28.800 --> 33:30.240
Come on, Vanessa.

33:30.320 --> 33:32.520
I know it's been many years,

33:33.480 --> 33:37.120
but your last name
doesn't mean "passion" for nothing.

33:38.240 --> 33:40.440
Who says I want to be in love?

33:40.520 --> 33:44.280
But you want someone
to fall in love with you,

33:45.400 --> 33:47.560
someone to look at you.

33:47.640 --> 33:50.200
You have to get out.
I can't pee with you here!

33:52.080 --> 33:53.640
Stop sabotaging me!

33:55.080 --> 33:58.640
What if you're the one
who's sabotaging me?

35:07.920 --> 35:09.320
No, it's okay.

35:09.400 --> 35:12.680
You've been listening to me for two hours.
This one is on me. No way.

35:13.160 --> 35:17.760
When you called me, I was in my pajamas
watching that wedding show.

35:18.560 --> 35:19.440
<i>Love Your Neighbor.</i>

35:19.520 --> 35:20.400
That's the one.

35:20.880 --> 35:23.000
I was watching that, and I thought,

35:23.920 --> 35:26.520
"Good thing I have my SatysFire."

35:27.080 --> 35:28.960
-Satis-what?
-And then I thought,

35:29.040 --> 35:33.000
"What Vanessa needs at this stage
is not a man,

35:33.080 --> 35:35.360
it's a SatysFire."

35:36.760 --> 35:39.400
German technology. Never failed me.

35:39.480 --> 35:44.160
But just in case, I had another
brand new one at home. It's yours.

35:45.520 --> 35:49.040
SatysFire Pro 2 Next Generation.

35:49.120 --> 35:52.000
The review
in the British <i>Cosmopolitan</i> said,

35:52.080 --> 35:55.080
"Jesus Christ! I'll never go out again."

35:57.560 --> 36:01.400
Imagine that your clitoris is music.

36:02.320 --> 36:04.240
All the music ever made.

36:05.080 --> 36:06.560
When it comes to music,

36:06.640 --> 36:10.640
most men don't go any further than playing
the triangle on a folklore dance group,

36:10.720 --> 36:14.640
or, at best,
they'll do a solo on the harmonica.

36:16.120 --> 36:21.040
But SatysFire is the Vienna Orchestra

36:21.120 --> 36:23.520
playing "Ride of the Valkyries."

36:24.360 --> 36:29.920
It's percussion. It's wind instruments.
It's brass. It's strings.

36:30.720 --> 36:36.680
Little friend, believe me, this one
puts more women into orbit in one day

36:37.200 --> 36:39.800
than NASA in a lifetime.

37:09.200 --> 37:12.400
Your place or mine?

37:22.000 --> 37:27.360
YOU WILL DISAPPOINT
A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS LIFE, BOY

37:27.440 --> 37:29.480
-I declare you--
-You can kiss each other!

37:44.320 --> 37:45.240
Thank you.

38:11.960 --> 38:13.720
Capristano.

38:13.800 --> 38:16.040
Montevelho.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.720
May your love

38:50.640 --> 38:55.520
never be sabotaged by tiny people.

38:57.160 --> 38:59.960
Only people of low moral stature

39:01.920 --> 39:05.040
won't recognize their smallness.

39:07.160 --> 39:13.880
Dwarfism can also be a heart disease.

39:14.440 --> 39:16.200
As the poet said,

39:16.280 --> 39:22.080
"To be great, be whole."

39:22.160 --> 39:25.280
The poet didn't say,
"To be tiny, be whole."

39:25.360 --> 39:26.360
No, no, no.

39:26.440 --> 39:29.920
The poet didn't say,
"To be small, be whole."

39:30.720 --> 39:32.840
He didn't say, "To be minimal, be whole."

39:32.920 --> 39:36.000
No, the poet said,
"To be great, be whole."

39:36.640 --> 39:39.920
He didn't say,
"To be tiny, be a quarter, be half."

39:40.000 --> 39:41.440
No! "To be great…

39:42.920 --> 39:43.920
Great."

39:50.760 --> 39:51.720
Thank you.

39:58.280 --> 40:00.800
The bride and groom's parents
act like children.

40:02.320 --> 40:07.680
"Two households, both alike in dignity,
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,

40:08.200 --> 40:11.080
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,

40:11.160 --> 40:13.520
Where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean."

40:14.520 --> 40:16.440
I played Romeo in school.

40:17.160 --> 40:18.200
Yeah, yeah.

40:18.280 --> 40:19.840
No, I played the friar.

40:26.120 --> 40:30.240
They say maturity comes much later in men.

40:38.360 --> 40:41.400
-Today I went out with someone else.
-I had a date this week.

40:41.480 --> 40:42.960
-Did you have fun?
-Did it go well?

40:43.960 --> 40:45.280
-Sort of.
-I think so.

40:57.320 --> 41:02.040
That's a hair implant

41:02.600 --> 41:05.400
of the highest quality.

41:06.280 --> 41:08.720
No, that's a hairpiece.

41:20.800 --> 41:23.520
Is this your idea of a firework display?

41:25.480 --> 41:29.920
Mr. Capristano,
this is the best I could get.

41:36.280 --> 41:39.240
You're going to disappoint a lot of people
in this life, boy.

41:39.320 --> 41:40.520
Oh, yes, you are.

41:40.600 --> 41:44.120
Unacceptable! This is unacceptable!

41:45.600 --> 41:47.640
Of course it is, girl! Frankly.

41:47.720 --> 41:49.360
What's the problem? Forget that.

41:49.440 --> 41:52.640
It doesn't make any sense, damn it!
I don't want this!

41:52.720 --> 41:53.960
What's unacceptable?

41:54.040 --> 41:56.080
Listen, are you kidding me or what?

41:56.160 --> 41:59.040
-Who had this absurd idea?
-I did. Why?

41:59.120 --> 42:03.640
Get this out of here right now,
you hear me? I'm not…

42:03.720 --> 42:05.640
Buddy, don't you touch it, please.

42:05.720 --> 42:08.320
-No, up.
-No, down, right now.

42:08.400 --> 42:09.720
-Up.
-Down!

42:09.800 --> 42:11.080
No, no, down.

42:11.160 --> 42:12.800
-Dad!
-Dad!

42:21.000 --> 42:25.000
Ricardo! Look at me!

42:27.960 --> 42:28.880
Dad!

42:35.040 --> 42:36.000
It's funny.

42:36.480 --> 42:39.080
Actually, I can't imagine you at raves.

42:40.280 --> 42:43.720
I was king of the after-hours then.

42:44.920 --> 42:49.240
I've always enjoyed dancing,
Vanda of the Band.

42:50.840 --> 42:52.720
You're telling me a lot.

42:56.320 --> 42:57.640
Dário the Notary.

43:02.640 --> 43:05.560
So, Luísa, what are you doing?

43:07.720 --> 43:11.080
I'm waiting for Frank Sinatra's concert.

43:13.760 --> 43:16.280
Right! How foolish of me!

44:10.400 --> 44:14.640
-Can I count on you? This will work out.
-Yes, you can. It's okay.

44:21.080 --> 44:23.800
This has already been resolved.
We can get going, okay?

44:28.960 --> 44:32.680
Don't worry, he won't press charges
against the bride and groom's parents.

44:32.760 --> 44:33.680
Thank you.

44:35.440 --> 44:38.200
Why didn't you say you were a cop
when we met?

44:38.280 --> 44:41.160
I also didn't tell you
I was a miniature golf champion.

44:42.520 --> 44:45.920
I'm serious, I was known
as the Tiger Woods of Fernão Ferro.

44:46.600 --> 44:49.600
-Were you from Fernão Ferro?
-Actually, I grew up in Estoril,

44:49.680 --> 44:52.440
in a neighborhood
full of white-collar crimes.

44:53.080 --> 44:55.640
I was once threatened

44:56.320 --> 44:58.760
by a banker armed with a cigar cutter.

44:59.280 --> 45:01.000
I'm still traumatized to this day.

46:15.040 --> 46:17.720
Don't sleep in the office tonight, please.

47:00.360 --> 47:01.880
Never take your eyes off the tiger.
