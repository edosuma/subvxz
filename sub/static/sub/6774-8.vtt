00:00.601 --> 00:02.267
 Liv: <i> Previously on</i> izombie...

00:02.269 --> 00:04.003
  You think you can cure this?

00:04.005 --> 00:05.388
  You were expecting
  to stay like this forever?

00:05.389 --> 00:06.772
    So you're using the rats
    in search for a cure?

00:06.774 --> 00:07.973
  Have you guys seen my friend?

00:07.975 --> 00:09.308
    Brother, i just saw him.

00:09.310 --> 00:10.843
       We'll have you
       to him in no time.

00:10.845 --> 00:12.478
   Major found the candyman
   and someone else.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.680
 <i> He thinks they're responsible</i>
 <i> for the missing kids.</i>

00:14.682 --> 00:18.684
  Liv: <i> Major is not gonna let</i>
 <i> this go. He'll go after them.</i>

00:19.153 --> 00:21.020
     -(police sirens wailing)
     -whoa!

00:21.022 --> 00:23.022
        Look, that's him,
        the candyman.

00:23.024 --> 00:25.090
 He's got a human brain
 in that ice chest right there!

00:28.229 --> 00:31.063
  Guard: A little thank you for
 the <i> seattle observer</i> article.

00:33.868 --> 00:34.933
              Yes.

00:36.570 --> 00:37.403
              Yes.

00:38.039 --> 00:39.104
              Yes.

00:40.307 --> 00:41.373
            Oh! No.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.908
               No.

00:42.910 --> 00:44.643
           No! Aieee!

00:44.645 --> 00:47.913
   Ow! I forgot the safe word.
   What's the safe word?

00:47.915 --> 00:50.082
   Kelly clarkson! Ping pong!
   (gasps)

00:50.084 --> 00:51.650
          Ah! Ah, yes.

00:52.686 --> 00:53.585
         That's better.

00:54.555 --> 00:55.821
       That's the ticket.

00:56.757 --> 00:59.591
       That's a good boy.

00:59.593 --> 01:02.928
   -Your reward in the kingdom
   of heaven will be great.
   -Enough.

01:05.833 --> 01:07.466
            Just relax.

01:09.570 --> 01:10.903
        Breathe into it.

01:10.905 --> 01:13.439
     Liv: <i> I'd forgotten what</i>
    <i> it was like to be touched.</i>

01:13.441 --> 01:15.541
      <i> This foot-rub dessert</i>
      <i> is tasty.</i>

01:18.012 --> 01:20.512
      (cell phone vibrating)

01:20.514 --> 01:22.514
  Do you need to grab
  that very early phone call?

01:24.418 --> 01:25.484
             (sighs)

01:30.224 --> 01:33.725
    Woman on radio: <i> A juicy,</i>

01:41.569 --> 01:43.936

01:43.938 --> 01:47.473
 Liv: <i> Cheeseburgers.</i>
 Man on radio: <i> Give</i>

01:47.475 --> 01:50.242
    Liv: <i> A rosy complexion.</i>

01:50.244 --> 01:51.910
   Woman on radio: <i> Estate</i>
   <i> planning, the peace of mind</i>
   <i> that lasts for generations.</i>

01:51.912 --> 01:53.445
          Liv: <i> Progeny.</i>

01:53.447 --> 01:55.214
    Woman on radio:

01:55.216 --> 01:56.582
     <i> Call your friends at...</i>

01:56.584 --> 01:58.550
Liv: <i> Sex, on the other hand...</i>

01:59.553 --> 02:01.420
               Ahhh!

02:01.422 --> 02:03.122
    <i> That's back on the menu</i>

   Sasha on radio:
   <i> ...Frequent caller</i>

02:07.061 --> 02:10.929
<i> Who thinks her husband</i>
<i> might be getting his kicks</i>

02:10.931 --> 02:13.499
    <i> Cheated, what's the 411?</i>

02:13.501 --> 02:15.834
  Cheated (in southern accent):
  <i> I finally caught the two of</i>
 <i> 'em, followed 'em to a hotel.</i>

02:15.836 --> 02:18.303
    <i> They were basically</i>
    <i> dry humping in the lobby.</i>

    Sasha: <i> Cheated,</i>

  <i> about self-empowerment, but</i>
  <i> that doesn't include murder.</i>

02:35.623 --> 02:38.323
    Cheated: <i> Maybe</i>

       What about that place

03:00.781 --> 03:03.182
     I don't know,
     what you're thinking,
     some takeout?

03:03.184 --> 03:04.249
      I could go for thai.

03:05.286 --> 03:06.351
       Yeah. Spring rolls?

03:06.353 --> 03:08.053
            Excuse me.

03:08.055 --> 03:09.655
       I was wondering
       if you've received

03:09.657 --> 03:11.290
   Any further news about when
   my friend might be released.

03:11.292 --> 03:13.192
      Yeah, but i'm
      keeping it to myself

03:13.194 --> 03:15.861
 Because i enjoy these chats we
 have every 15 minutes or so.

03:15.863 --> 03:18.063
    -Maybe don't be friends
    with criminals.
    -(snickers)

03:22.503 --> 03:23.702
           (exhales)

03:32.046 --> 03:35.514
    (footsteps approaching)

03:35.516 --> 03:37.849
    Clerk: Could go for some
    butter chicken right now,
        that's for sure.

03:37.851 --> 03:39.318
       Or french.
       What about french?

03:41.088 --> 03:42.988
  Peyton charles,
  assistant district attorney.

03:42.990 --> 03:44.823
            Gotta go.

03:44.825 --> 03:47.593
 Do you notice anything missing
 with this paperwork?

03:47.595 --> 03:49.228
         Save your eyes.

03:49.230 --> 03:51.563
   It's missing a time stamp,
   which means

03:51.565 --> 03:54.566
     The prisoner is being
     held in violation of
     habeas corpus statutes.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.635
 -I could put the stamp on now.
 -Are you offering
 to commit forgery?

03:58.372 --> 04:00.606
       -No.
       -Get him out. Now.

04:00.608 --> 04:02.708
        And hope to hell
        he doesn't go to
        the press or sue,

04:02.710 --> 04:03.508
         Cause it'll be
         both our asses.

04:10.684 --> 04:12.084
   I read it for the articles.

04:13.954 --> 04:16.188
           (snickers)

04:16.190 --> 04:18.023
 The prisoner's being released.
 Fifteen minutes, tops.

04:18.024 --> 04:18.824
         Make it five.

04:37.778 --> 04:38.844
           Oh, my god.

04:42.216 --> 04:44.049
      (theme song playing)

05:07.474 --> 05:09.441
    What did they do to you
    in there?

05:09.443 --> 05:12.144
 There seemed to be some lesson
 i was meant to learn.

05:12.146 --> 05:14.012
     You may need to put me
     on retainer, young man.

05:14.014 --> 05:15.781
 I'm... I'm sorry. And you are?

05:15.783 --> 05:18.016
    This is my roommate ravi,
    liv's boss.

05:18.018 --> 05:19.818
      Ravi, this is peyton,
      liv's roommate.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.286
     I did try to call liv.

05:21.288 --> 05:23.322
         -You did what?
         -Horrible idea.

05:23.324 --> 05:25.590
  We'd have
  two messes to clean up.
  Have you looked in a mirror?

05:25.592 --> 05:27.826
     I have a feeling
     people who are friends
     with social workers

05:27.828 --> 05:30.295
 Don't ask this question a lot,
 but who were you fighting with
           this week?

05:30.297 --> 05:32.364
    Sons of anarchy, i think.

05:32.366 --> 05:35.200
 Guards commuted their
 sentences to 20 minutes
 of beating the hell out of me.

05:35.202 --> 05:38.337
   Hey, word of advice.
   Try not getting arrested
   the day after you're quoted

05:38.339 --> 05:40.939
 On the front page of the paper
 saying that local police
 are indifferent

05:40.941 --> 05:43.008
      To the disappearance
      of the underclass.

05:43.010 --> 05:45.110
  If you want to sue the city,
  i can put you in touch
  with someone.

05:45.112 --> 05:47.879
    No, the only witnesses
    were the guards and
    the guys whipping my ass.

05:47.881 --> 05:50.916
  It's a waste of my time.
  I just wanna find out what
  happened to jerome and eddie.

05:54.121 --> 05:56.021
              What?

05:56.023 --> 05:59.358
    All right, look... Um...
    (clears throat)

05:59.360 --> 06:02.127
  You know the, uh,
  emily sparrow disappearance?

06:02.129 --> 06:05.564
    She was kidnapped by, uh,
    space-alien worshipping,

06:05.566 --> 06:08.633
   Sister-wife collecting
   cultists. A married couple.

06:09.570 --> 06:12.404
           The, uh...

06:12.406 --> 06:15.941
 The police found the remains
 of a number of the skate park
    kids at their compound.

06:16.643 --> 06:17.676
        Jerome and eddie?

06:20.881 --> 06:22.047
             You...

06:22.049 --> 06:24.750
  You did everything you could.

06:24.752 --> 06:27.386
 I mean, they couldn't have had
 anyone more in their corner.

06:28.055 --> 06:28.887
         It's over now.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.626
      I've known in my gut
      that they were gone,

06:36.697 --> 06:39.498
      But i've seen things.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.334
   If i told you,
   you wouldn't believe me.

06:42.336 --> 06:44.369
       I know who killed
       jerome and eddie,

06:44.371 --> 06:45.670
    And it wasn't these two.

06:47.374 --> 06:50.308
 Everything the police tell you
 in this town is a lie.

06:53.247 --> 06:54.780
  This is a long way from over.

06:57.618 --> 07:00.385
Sasha:
<i> Cheated on in chattanooga,</i>
<i> we're all concerned about you.</i>

07:00.387 --> 07:01.753
       <i> -Please call back.</i>
        -Sorry i'm late.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.622
     I had to help a friend
     with a legal matter.

07:03.624 --> 07:06.425
             Shh!

07:06.427 --> 07:08.693
   Cheated on in chattanooga
   threatened to kill her
   husband's mistress on air.

07:08.695 --> 07:11.363
  Sasha, the host, is
  trying to talk her out of it,
  but she won't call back in.

07:11.365 --> 07:13.598
         Really, liv?

07:13.600 --> 07:16.868
  -I'm surprised you find this
  trashy, lowest-common...
  -Zip it!

07:16.870 --> 07:20.806
    Sasha: <i> Come on, ladies.</i>
    <i> The world is full</i>
    <i> of eligible men,</i>

07:20.808 --> 07:23.608
  <i> -And not one of them is...</i>
   -(electronic zapping sound)

07:23.610 --> 07:25.644
      -What just happened?
      -No idea.

07:25.646 --> 07:27.712
   -(electronic disturbance)
   -woman: <i> Sasha!</i>

07:27.714 --> 07:29.414
        Man 1: <i> Oh, my god,</i>
       <i> what's happening?</i>

07:29.416 --> 07:31.416
      Woman: <i> Sasha! Sasha!</i>
      Man 1: <i> Shut it off!</i>

07:31.418 --> 07:33.552
          <i> Shut it off!</i>
          <i> Shut it off!</i>

07:33.554 --> 07:34.519
       Man 2: <i> Somebody</i>
       <i> call an ambulance!</i>
       Man 1: <i> Sasha!</i>

07:38.292 --> 07:40.625
   I stand corrected.
   This is compelling radio.

07:46.500 --> 07:49.668
 Ravi: The electricity entered
 the body through her hands.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.503
   The current then passed
   through her chest cavity.

07:51.505 --> 07:53.839
        Causing instant
        cardiac arrest.

07:53.841 --> 07:56.741
    Electrocution is
    an extremely rare cause
    of accidental death.

07:56.743 --> 07:57.843
   Well, wasn't an accident.

07:59.112 --> 08:00.579
        According to the
        fire inspector,

08:00.581 --> 08:03.348
 Someone intentionally spliced
 the victim's microphone

08:03.350 --> 08:05.817
       Into the station's
       backup generator.

08:05.819 --> 08:09.154
     Moment she touched it
     after the break, bam!

08:09.156 --> 08:11.623
   First thing we need to do
   is find

08:11.625 --> 08:13.825
   Cheated on in chattanooga.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.994
 The caller who threatened to
 murder her husband's mistress
       on today's show?

08:17.865 --> 08:19.097
             Um...

08:19.099 --> 08:22.000
      First-time listener.

08:22.002 --> 08:25.136
  -Why her?
  -You know that license plate
  number she gave on the air?

08:25.138 --> 08:26.605
      The car's registered
      to the victim.

08:28.375 --> 08:29.241
           Shocking.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.010
           Too soon?

08:41.655 --> 08:44.489
 Did sasha recognize
 her own license plate number
 when she heard it on the air?

08:44.491 --> 08:48.293
    Yeah, she was terrified.
    She sent me downstairs
    to grab security.

08:48.295 --> 08:50.529
  As the show's producer, you
  screened the calls, decided

08:50.531 --> 08:52.531
   -Which made it on the air?
   -That's right.

08:52.533 --> 08:55.734
   It's a local show,
   but this caller,
   cheated on in chattanooga,

08:55.736 --> 08:58.303
        Was she calling
        from tennessee?

08:58.305 --> 09:00.171
   Well, our show is streamed
   nationwide, but i could
   tell from the caller id,

09:00.173 --> 09:03.174
  Cheated on in chattanooga's
  calls all came from
  a seattle area code.

09:03.176 --> 09:04.843
        So, she called
        the show a lot?

09:04.845 --> 09:07.479
    Ten, twelve times
    over the past few weeks.

09:07.481 --> 09:11.483
     She was high drama.
     A woman on the verge.

09:11.485 --> 09:13.351
 -She gave great radio.
 -We'll need those recordings.

09:13.353 --> 09:14.653
             Yeah.

09:14.655 --> 09:16.988
          Hey, kaley.

09:16.990 --> 09:20.892
 Can you get these officers the
 past couple weeks of shows?

09:20.894 --> 09:23.695
   Now, this week's shows
   might take a little longer
   to get our hands on,

09:23.697 --> 09:26.064
 But, uh, you'll have plenty
 to listen to in the meantime.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.767
    Unfortunately, we don't
    archive by caller,
    so if you want

09:28.769 --> 09:31.069
     The cheated segments,
     somebody'll have
     to go through, like,

09:31.071 --> 09:33.104
   -30 hours of audio files.
   -I'll do it.

09:34.875 --> 09:36.341
      Who couldn't use
      some straight talk?

09:36.343 --> 09:38.677
    That was, uh, definitely
    sasha's forte.

09:38.679 --> 09:39.578
       She was fearless.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.581
      God, i can't believe

09:42.583 --> 09:45.116
  She's gone. We made so many
  hours of radio together.

09:45.118 --> 09:47.385
    I'm sorry.
    I think i need a minute.

09:47.387 --> 09:49.521
           Of course.

09:49.523 --> 09:51.523
    -Clive: I take it sasha
    and jane were close?
    -Oh, super close.

09:51.525 --> 09:53.258
      Like, since college.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.926
   Sasha was the psych major
   with the big personality.

09:54.928 --> 09:57.529
     Jane was the rtf major
     with the radio skills.

09:57.531 --> 10:00.065
 They had this whole liz lemon,
 jenna maroney thing going on,

10:00.067 --> 10:02.534
   But in a "not funny" way.

10:02.536 --> 10:04.936
  You happen to know who sasha
  was seeing romantically?

10:04.938 --> 10:08.740
 Specifically? No. I mean,
 she talked about her sex life
 on the air all the time,

10:08.742 --> 10:12.143
  But her lovers always got
  code names. The all-nighter,
  sir cries-a-lot.

10:12.145 --> 10:14.279
        So, there were
        a lot of lovers?

10:14.281 --> 10:16.648
   From what she said, yeah.

10:16.650 --> 10:18.984
       I don't know any
       names or anything,

10:18.986 --> 10:22.287
 But everybody around here
 knew she had a thing for
 men already in relationships.

10:24.124 --> 10:26.791
 Do you think one of her lovers
 did this?

10:26.793 --> 10:28.727
       We'll look into
       every possibility.

10:28.729 --> 10:32.063
           This way.

10:32.065 --> 10:35.400
   This is the line
   to sasha's mic. It should
   ground into this panel,

10:35.402 --> 10:37.902
   But the killer
   ran it over there
   into the backup generator.

10:37.904 --> 10:40.005
  Who has access to this room?

10:40.007 --> 10:43.475
 Five stations under
 the panopticon umbrella, all
 operate out of this building.

10:43.477 --> 10:46.745
  Plus, there's
  the public tours that
  tramp through here all day.

10:46.747 --> 10:51.249
 Last week, some clown wandered
 into a kgov live broadcast.

10:51.251 --> 10:55.854
 Took half a dozen calls before
 somebody figured out he wasn't
   really a city comptroller.

10:55.856 --> 10:58.023
    So, basically, anyone
    could've gotten in here?

11:02.029 --> 11:04.829
      Sasha: <i> Yes,</i>
     <i> manscaping is a thing.</i>

11:04.831 --> 11:07.766
 <i> You can't expect a girl to go</i>
 <i> hacking through the brush</i>

11:07.768 --> 11:10.268
 <i> Like indiana jones looking</i>
 <i> for the lost peruvian temple.</i>

11:11.938 --> 11:14.139
     <i> I want to make sure</i>
     <i> you don't do anything</i>

11:14.141 --> 11:15.840
             <i> Rash.</i>

11:15.842 --> 11:18.643
         -You need me?
         -No.

11:18.645 --> 11:21.146
     It's just that
     i had some business
     down at the courthouse

11:21.148 --> 11:23.214
     And met your roommate
     peyton.

11:23.216 --> 11:25.283
 -Bit of a spitfire, isn't she?
 -Yeah.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.719
       -Is she seeing
       anyone presently?
       -Probably.

11:30.824 --> 11:33.558
  You're asking because
  you might wanna ask her out?

11:33.560 --> 11:36.461
  (sighs) for a moment there,
  i thought i might have
  to draw you a diagram.

11:36.463 --> 11:38.029
          I'll check.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.598
  She's not generally lacking
  for male companionship.

11:41.401 --> 11:42.734
    I think we had a moment.

11:43.370 --> 11:44.202
              Oh!

11:48.208 --> 11:52.377
 The early shift was displeased
 that the supply closet
 is now padlocked.

11:52.379 --> 11:55.380
 They'll get over it. This is
 where we're curing zombie-ism.

11:55.382 --> 11:58.583
 I'm mid-experiment. Our guinea
 rats are behind this door,

11:58.585 --> 12:01.686
    Rolling hard on utopium
    and max rager.

12:01.688 --> 12:05.523
    Right now, they're
    probably waving tiny
    glow sticks in the air.

12:05.525 --> 12:08.426
     I think someone
     needs an escort
     to the chill-out room.

12:11.398 --> 12:12.263
              Liv!

12:19.506 --> 12:22.440
  Ravi: Their brains are
  missing, every one of them.

12:22.442 --> 12:24.776
      "the lannisters
      send their regards."

12:25.679 --> 12:26.745
              Ugh.

12:26.747 --> 12:29.013
    -Where is the fifth rat?
    -Don't know.

12:29.015 --> 12:31.483
 But i can't stress enough
 the importance of finding him.

12:33.954 --> 12:36.688
         (rat squeaks)

12:36.690 --> 12:38.523
   Holy crap, ravi!
   He's white and murderous.

12:38.525 --> 12:40.191
     You did it.
     You made a zombie rat.

12:41.061 --> 12:42.360
        (rat screeching)

12:42.362 --> 12:44.629
      Where are you going,
      little buddy?

12:44.631 --> 12:48.399
    Uh, i believe he was
    on his way to murder me
    and eat my brains.

12:48.401 --> 12:49.868
 Why isn't he tearing into you?

12:49.870 --> 12:52.203
    Oh, it's a zombie thing.
    You wouldn't understand.

12:52.205 --> 12:54.105
    Zombie brains are nasty.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.908
    You wouldn't want those.
    No, you wouldn't.

12:56.910 --> 12:59.811
 Uh, that rat you're doting on
 like a purse chihuahua

12:59.813 --> 13:02.480
     Could end civilization
     as we know it.

13:02.482 --> 13:03.481
           (giggles)

13:06.887 --> 13:10.088
    Right. The human genome
    is full of so-called
    "junk dna," right?

13:10.090 --> 13:12.390
    Veritable sleeper cells
    of evolution,

13:12.392 --> 13:15.960
 Waiting to be called to action
 by a change in environment
 or circumstance.

13:15.962 --> 13:20.431
 Enter, a chemical cocktail of
 tainted utopium and max rager.

13:20.433 --> 13:22.267
       Cocktail wakes up
       dormant genes,

13:22.269 --> 13:24.469
    Which then transforms
    an ordinary human or rat

13:24.471 --> 13:26.638
     Into a zombie
     at the cellular level.

13:26.640 --> 13:29.974
 So, you'll use antibodies from
 zombie-rat to synthesize
 a gene therapy-based cure.

13:29.976 --> 13:33.311
        That's the plan.

13:33.313 --> 13:36.014
  Do you think
  this is how oppenheimer felt
  staring down at the a-bomb?

13:36.016 --> 13:37.849
      Like a drama queen?

13:37.851 --> 13:40.251
 Or are you talking about his
 need for self-aggrandizement?

13:40.253 --> 13:43.021
 -Aw.
 -Oh, come on! Gentle ribbing.

13:43.023 --> 13:44.656
 Dr. Oppenheimer, you love me.

13:45.659 --> 13:47.926
          He loves me.

13:47.928 --> 13:51.529
  Cheated on in chattanooga's
  phone was a burner,
  totally untraceable.

13:51.531 --> 13:54.199
        New development.
        Check this out.

13:54.201 --> 13:58.102
     Dear god,
     how about a heads-up,
     or an nsfw warning?

13:58.104 --> 14:00.038
  Is that a blow-up sex doll?

14:00.040 --> 14:01.172
       Ooh! I wanna see.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.775
    With sasha arconi's face
    taped over the doll's.

14:03.777 --> 14:05.276
   There are a bunch of them.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.111
   Sasha was in a blood feud
   with the host

14:07.113 --> 14:09.681
  Of a rival drive-time sports
  talk show, <i> the morning hurl.</i>

14:09.683 --> 14:13.117
  The host, chuck burd,
  asked all of his listeners,
  "upchuckers" they're called,

14:13.119 --> 14:17.355
  To commit unspeakable acts
  upon a sasha arconi blow-up
  doll and post them online.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.858
      -Delightful.
      -Sasha gave it
      as good as she got.

14:19.860 --> 14:22.026
 She was promoting a roundtable
 interview next week

14:22.028 --> 14:23.995
      With several of
      chuck's past lovers.

14:23.997 --> 14:25.663
    It sounds like we should
    have a chat with chuck.

14:25.665 --> 14:27.298
      Exactly my thought.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.133
  Clive: "great morning sex."

14:29.135 --> 14:31.169
 Isn't it enough for you ladies
 that you're having it?

14:31.171 --> 14:33.538
      Why spoil it
      by talking about it?

14:33.540 --> 14:35.640
   See, i find it fascinating
   that we never talk
   about your love life.

14:35.642 --> 14:38.076
    Really? 'cause i find it
    non-negotiable.

14:38.078 --> 14:40.178
  -Boundaries, liv.
  -"stressing of boundaries,"

14:40.180 --> 14:42.814
    One of several signs
    of a classic distancer.

14:42.816 --> 14:46.150
 Pair that with "avoiding
 discussion of deep feelings."

14:46.152 --> 14:48.887
      -I'm going in now.
      -"pulling away when
       things get real."

14:48.889 --> 14:50.889
    Look, it's nice you want
    to get to know me.

14:50.891 --> 14:54.592
   -"sending mixed signals."
   -what's gotten into you?

14:54.594 --> 14:58.396
   You listen to sasha's show
   for one day and now
   you think you're her?

14:58.398 --> 15:00.398
      (sighs)
      something like that.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.767
  I'm not the "let's get real"
  type, anyway.

15:02.769 --> 15:04.769
      Ask devore in vice.
      She'd tell you.

15:04.771 --> 15:08.573
  "idealizing a past partner."
  you are so textbook.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.875
    Seriously, you can
    stop talking right now.

15:10.877 --> 15:13.611
  I know everything
  there is to know about you.

15:13.613 --> 15:15.947
    Chuck on radio:
    <i> I'm not saying he should</i>
    <i> have done what he did.</i>

15:15.949 --> 15:19.250
   <i> All i'm saying is,</i>
   <i> any guy who's been married</i>
   <i> for more than five minutes</i>

15:19.252 --> 15:21.152
   <i> Knows exactly how he felt!</i>

15:22.055 --> 15:24.122
    <i> Ladies, listen to this.</i>

15:24.124 --> 15:27.225
     <i> Your mouths were</i>
     <i> not made for speaking.</i>

15:27.227 --> 15:28.693
     Not for speak... Ooh!

15:29.296 --> 15:30.795
              Huh.

15:30.797 --> 15:34.399
 Upchuckers, show of hands,
 who's screwed an albino chick?

15:34.401 --> 15:35.767
          Huh? Anyone?
          Anyone?

15:35.769 --> 15:37.635
     I think what they lack
     in pigment,

15:37.637 --> 15:39.570
        They make up for
        in nasty.

15:39.572 --> 15:41.372
     Am i right? You know,
     don't ya?

15:41.374 --> 15:44.275
     We got a chick
     in studio, right now,

15:44.277 --> 15:47.245
     Begging for someone
     to bang a little color
     back into her cheeks.

15:47.247 --> 15:48.212
 Isn't that right, sweetheart?

15:49.716 --> 15:50.682
          What's that?

15:55.488 --> 15:58.089
      The feud with sasha
      was all for show.

15:58.091 --> 16:01.559
   The more pms-y she acted,
   the more fired up
   my listeners got.

16:02.996 --> 16:05.396
  The broad was ratings gold.

16:06.232 --> 16:07.799
              So,

16:07.801 --> 16:09.000
       Your relationship
       with your mom,

16:09.002 --> 16:11.302
  I'm going with complicated.

16:11.304 --> 16:15.073
    Extreme narcissism
    with a tendency towards
    sexual deviance.

16:15.075 --> 16:17.308
    (in high-pitched voice)
    "mommy issues."

16:17.310 --> 16:19.777
  All i'm saying is,
  the inexplicable crying when
  you're cuffing the carrot,

16:19.779 --> 16:22.447
  -There's a reason for that.
  -Mr. Burd.

16:22.449 --> 16:24.916
   This show sasha was
   supposed to do about you,

16:24.918 --> 16:27.986
 A lot of men would feel
 threatened by their ex-lovers
 comparing notes on the radio.

16:27.988 --> 16:31.456
 Yeah, unless all of your notes
 are just, muah!

16:31.458 --> 16:33.658
     (chuckles)
     you know what i mean?

16:33.660 --> 16:35.927
  I was just worried
  she wouldn't be able to
  fit 'em all into the studio.

16:35.929 --> 16:38.763
  If i'm gonna puke in your
  trash bin, do i need to go
  through the basketball hoop?

16:38.765 --> 16:40.965
 What do i care if one of them
 said something bad?

16:40.967 --> 16:44.102
 You and i both know how women
 get when you kick 'em loose.

16:44.104 --> 16:45.670
       -You kicked a lot
       of women loose?
       -Not anymore.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.538
     I'm a happily married
     man now.

16:47.540 --> 16:48.973
           (sniggers)

16:48.975 --> 16:49.907
        That's my girl.

16:52.645 --> 16:55.279
 -(dance music playing)
 -(in russian accent) stay away
 from my husband, whore!

16:57.050 --> 16:59.517
            (gasps)

16:59.519 --> 17:01.753
 Chuck: She's not the brightest
 bulb in the chandelier, but
 she is a former gymnast.

17:02.389 --> 17:04.789
         Power tumbler.

17:04.790 --> 17:07.392
 When your wife found out you
 were sleeping with sasha, was
  she mad enough to kill her?

17:16.368 --> 17:19.203
    (laughs nervously)
    okay, sasha and i bumped
    uglies a couple times,

17:19.204 --> 17:22.540
   But i'm not the first guy
   to have a little hate bang
   on the side.

17:22.541 --> 17:25.710
  No, but you're a guy with an
  angry wife and a dead lover.

17:25.712 --> 17:30.481
    You think oksana is
    this chattanooga chick?

17:30.483 --> 17:34.919
   She's a mail-order bride.
   She speaks maybe
   50 words of english.

17:34.921 --> 17:38.322
  The woman could barely order
  a cup of coffee, let alone
  fake a southern accent!

17:38.324 --> 17:40.892
    Where were you yesterday
    between 9:30 and 9:45?

17:40.894 --> 17:43.594
   Talking about ambidextrous
   hookers on the radio.

17:43.596 --> 17:46.164
  It's a public service piece
  i like to do.

17:46.166 --> 17:48.032
  If you'll excuse me,
  i've got 42 seconds to take
  a leak before the news.

17:52.272 --> 17:54.839
     For what it's worth,
     i don't think his wife
     could've passed for

17:54.841 --> 17:58.009
   Cheated on in chattanooga.
   Maybe "cheated on
   in chechnya."

17:58.011 --> 18:00.511
      That doesn't mean
      she didn't kill her.
      I'll check her out.

18:01.915 --> 18:03.347
            (sighs)

18:03.349 --> 18:05.316
    Where's a vat of bleach
    when you need one?

18:07.921 --> 18:08.786
        Corinne: Hello?

18:14.894 --> 18:16.461
 So you missed our lunch date.

18:17.530 --> 18:19.197
        Things have been
        kind of crazy,

18:19.199 --> 18:20.698
  But i'll make it up to you,
  okay?

18:22.102 --> 18:24.602
    Oh, my god. Major, what
    happened to your face?

18:25.538 --> 18:26.604
       It's a long story.

18:29.742 --> 18:32.143
 I... I broke into a guy's car.

18:32.145 --> 18:34.779
 Then the cops put me in a cell
 with these bikers and...

18:34.781 --> 18:36.814
     -Whatever, you know,
     it, it doesn't matter.
     -It does matter!

18:40.587 --> 18:42.153
     Why are you looking
     at pictures of brains?

18:43.656 --> 18:46.791
    You know what?
    Don't even answer that.

18:46.793 --> 18:49.560
     This is so not
     what i signed up for.

18:49.562 --> 18:52.730
 -Look, i, i know i've been...
 -You keep getting into fights.

18:52.732 --> 18:57.235
 You just got arrested. You
 are in a running battle with
 someone known as the candyman?

18:57.237 --> 19:01.772
 What the hell?
 You were the dream combination
 of superhot but funny

19:01.774 --> 19:05.776
    And now you're like some
    whackjob who doesn't
    shower enough.

19:05.778 --> 19:08.479
   -If you give me
   a second to explain...
   -You should get some help.

19:17.991 --> 19:19.157
  I take it game night's off?

19:19.159 --> 19:20.224
          (door slams)

19:24.597 --> 19:26.797
        Enter the hero.

19:26.799 --> 19:30.701
   -Why so glum, chum?
   -I can't do this anymore.

19:30.703 --> 19:33.504
   Moving those kids' bodies,
   it was too much.

19:33.506 --> 19:36.807
 Emotionally, or...
 Because physically,
 it shouldn't've been that bad.

19:36.809 --> 19:38.276
  -How heavy are bones?
  -Damn it, you listen to me!

19:40.947 --> 19:43.648
     You're not even trying
     to be careful anymore.

19:43.650 --> 19:48.052
   The bodies are piling up,
   and you just expect me
   to make them disappear.

19:48.054 --> 19:51.822
  What part of "me having you
  by the short and curlies"
  don't you understand?

19:51.824 --> 19:53.191
       I'm literally
       your meal ticket.

19:53.193 --> 19:55.193
 Oh, i understand that, but...

19:55.195 --> 19:57.495
     What're you gonna do?
     Hmm?

19:57.497 --> 19:59.463
 Are you gonna mosey down to
 the holding cell and pop open

19:59.465 --> 20:01.832
  A couple of craniums a week
  and hope nobody gets wise?

20:01.834 --> 20:05.203
    Stop acting like you
    have options and just do
    what i tell you to do.

20:08.474 --> 20:10.241
     There's a girl
     in the m.E.'s office.

20:11.477 --> 20:13.477
             Pale.

20:13.479 --> 20:15.179
      Looks like she plays
      for team z.

20:15.181 --> 20:17.648
  Yeah, i know all about her.

20:17.650 --> 20:19.850
  She has her own special role
  in all this.

20:19.852 --> 20:21.886
     It would've been nice
     to get a heads-up.

20:21.888 --> 20:24.722
   I'm sorry, dear. You know
   how i struggle with my
   communication skills.

20:25.892 --> 20:27.892
 Now, run off and do your job.

20:28.895 --> 20:30.194
      Protect and serve...

20:30.196 --> 20:30.995
              Me.

20:35.902 --> 20:39.837
  Sasha: <i> The guy's a bully,</i>
  <i> and you're just laying back</i>
  <i> and taking it.</i>

20:39.839 --> 20:43.207
   <i> Act like his bitch,</i>
   <i> don't expect to be treated</i>
   <i> like his girlfriend.</i>

20:43.209 --> 20:45.743
 Liv: <i> Before this brain, my</i>
<i> advice-giving m.O. Was gentle.</i>

20:45.745 --> 20:47.278
          <i> Sympathetic.</i>

20:47.280 --> 20:49.013
      <i> Now i feel compelled</i>
      <i> to fix people,</i>

20:49.015 --> 20:51.382
  <i> To take them apart,</i>
  <i> whether they want it or not.</i>

20:51.384 --> 20:55.353
 Sasha: <i> Don't make me play it.</i>
 Caller: <i> But he meditates now.</i>
  <i> He's becoming a vegetarian.</i>

20:55.355 --> 20:58.656
Sasha: <i> You asked for it.</i>
<i> Tell her, miss lynch.</i>
Jane lynch: <i> Bitch, get a clue!</i>

21:00.560 --> 21:03.027
       <i> Bitch, get a clue!</i>

21:03.029 --> 21:05.963
    Sasha, i'm sorry! I was
    gonna tell you, i swear!

21:05.965 --> 21:08.966
    -Ahhh! Sasha!
    -I don't want apologies!
    I want loyalty!

21:09.702 --> 21:11.636
            (gasps)

21:11.638 --> 21:13.571
     Well, any time you mix
     friendship and work,

21:13.573 --> 21:16.607
  Things can get complicated,
  but sasha and i were fine.

21:16.609 --> 21:19.076
   Clive: So, you didn't mind
   when she yelled at you
   and threw things?

21:19.078 --> 21:20.911
 -That was cool with you?
 -You heard about the cupcakes.

21:20.913 --> 21:24.582
   (gasps) yeah, sasha
   could go a little psycho,

21:24.584 --> 21:26.584
        -But that time
        i had it coming.
        -Why is that?

21:26.586 --> 21:29.320
  She found out i was sending
  tapes to other stations.

21:29.322 --> 21:33.157
  I should've told her, but...
  I don't know, i...

21:33.159 --> 21:36.327
    We started as co-hosts,
    and then sasha became
    this big star

21:36.329 --> 21:40.131
    And i became just
    her producer which was
    fine for a while, but...

21:40.133 --> 21:42.166
    But you would've rather
    been behind the mic.

21:42.168 --> 21:43.734
  Anybody in radio says
  differently, they're lying.

21:44.971 --> 21:48.239
    -Did you get any offers?
    -No. Mmm-mmm.

21:48.241 --> 21:53.511
 It takes a special kind of
 charisma to get people to tune
 in and listen. Sasha had it.

21:53.513 --> 21:56.247
      Judging by
      my lack of offers...

21:56.249 --> 21:57.915
       Well, i guess
       we'll never know.

21:57.917 --> 22:00.751
     Sasha was pretty angry
     when she found out
     you wanted to leave.

22:00.753 --> 22:03.954
  Well, at first, and then
  she got over it and started
  fighting for a raise for me.

22:03.956 --> 22:07.191
     To entice me to stay.

22:07.193 --> 22:10.328
 Oh, we got those last cheated
 audio files from archives
 if you still want them.

22:10.763 --> 22:11.862
            Please.

22:16.869 --> 22:18.769
    Oyster shucking gloves.
    Observe.

22:27.180 --> 22:29.547
             -Ahhh!
             -Ravi!

22:29.549 --> 22:31.615
       <i> -Voila.</i> Chain mail
       for the hand.
       -Enjoy hell.

22:33.152 --> 22:34.885
   Have you seen major today?

22:34.887 --> 22:36.620
    I missed a call from him
    yesterday and i haven't
    heard back.

22:36.622 --> 22:39.790
     Oh, you... He's fine.

22:39.792 --> 22:42.860
   Well, he's got some stuff
   going on, romantically.

22:42.862 --> 22:46.063
  There was a break-up.
  In that, corinne dumped him.

22:46.065 --> 22:48.299
   Major doesn't get dumped.
   There are literally

22:48.301 --> 22:53.637
 Two reasons to end
 a relationship with major,
 zombie-ism and full-on death.

22:53.639 --> 22:55.539
       -Wait, you don't
       think corinne...
       -Is now a zombie?

22:55.541 --> 22:57.475
        Seems unlikely.

22:57.477 --> 23:00.478
  Speaking of roommates, have
  you spoken with peyton yet?

23:00.480 --> 23:04.014
  Wow. All roads lead to rome
  with you lately, huh?

23:04.016 --> 23:07.318
  I think you need
  to ask yourself why
  you're so interested in her.

23:07.320 --> 23:11.655
     I don't know. Just saw
     her in action briefly.
      She was quite fiery.

23:11.657 --> 23:15.092
  And you like them fiery.
  Someone kind of hard to get,

23:15.094 --> 23:18.262
  Maybe a little complicated.
  You want to have
  to put in some work.

23:18.264 --> 23:20.998
     -I don't shy away
     from a challenge.
     -Of course you don't.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.201
     Because then there's
     the potential to win.

23:24.203 --> 23:26.570
      To rewrite history,
      be the conqueror.

23:26.572 --> 23:27.872
        Wait, no, uh...

23:27.874 --> 23:30.508
  What history am i rewriting?

23:30.510 --> 23:33.377
   I don't know which parent
   was distant and made you
      work for affection.

23:33.379 --> 23:34.578
     Are you shrinking me?

23:34.580 --> 23:37.248
     I'm just pointing out
     obvious behavior

23:37.250 --> 23:39.917
    That could potentially
    lead to you being hurt.

23:39.919 --> 23:42.420
       Okay, i guess
       i'm shrinking you,

23:42.422 --> 23:45.956
   But you really do need
   to learn from the past
   and not try to relive it.

23:45.958 --> 23:48.058
  I can't help it. I'm filled
  to the brim with insight.

23:48.060 --> 23:50.261
        Oh, that's what
        you're full of?

23:50.263 --> 23:52.897
     Just find out if she's
     dating anyone, okay?

23:52.899 --> 23:53.831
       I live to enable.

23:57.036 --> 23:58.736
  Liv: <i> Fun fact of zombie-ism:</i>

23:58.738 --> 24:00.971
 <i> Knowing you're being affected</i>
 <i> by the brain you just ate</i>

24:00.973 --> 24:03.174
  <i> Doesn't always stop you</i>
  <i> from acting on its impulses.</i>

24:05.945 --> 24:07.478
             Major?

24:07.480 --> 24:10.047
  I can see your mopey shadow.
  Let me in.

24:10.049 --> 24:12.716
   Someone needs to tell you
   that self-sabotaging
   is not the answer.

24:13.753 --> 24:14.885
  You're allowed to be happy.

24:18.825 --> 24:21.258
      Oh, major.
      Who did this to you?

24:21.260 --> 24:22.460
 I can't talk about fight club.

24:23.763 --> 24:26.897
 -Crap.
 -I want to know what happened!

24:26.899 --> 24:28.232
       Would you believe
       shark attack?

24:30.136 --> 24:32.269
     Did you go to
     the skate park again?

24:32.271 --> 24:34.738
      Rough night in jail.

24:34.740 --> 24:36.440
   Turns out the police take
   umbrage when you accuse
   them of negligence.

24:36.442 --> 24:39.777
       You were in jail?
       Why didn't you...

24:39.779 --> 24:42.847
 You did call me. You called me
 from jail and i didn't answer.

24:42.849 --> 24:45.483
   It's fine, really.
   I'm glad you're here now.

24:46.118 --> 24:47.051
            (sighs)

24:51.424 --> 24:53.624
      You made it on
      the police blotter?

24:53.626 --> 24:56.827
 One of the kids at helton
 shelter brought that into
 a group session this morning.

24:56.829 --> 24:59.363
  Unfortunately, my bosses
  weren't nearly as impressed

24:59.365 --> 25:02.266
     With my "street cred"
     as this kid was,

25:02.268 --> 25:03.868
 So if you hear of anyone
 looking for a youth counselor

25:03.870 --> 25:06.604
      -With a rap sheet...
      -They fired you.

25:06.606 --> 25:09.173
     -Major, i'm so sorry.
     -Look at me.

25:09.175 --> 25:11.175
     (scoffs) i didn't
     give them much choice.

25:13.479 --> 25:16.380
     I need to talk to you
     about something.

25:16.382 --> 25:18.315
  I think you're the only one
  who might listen to me.

25:18.317 --> 25:19.950
           Of course.

25:19.952 --> 25:22.653
 Those people in the woods
 didn't kill jerome and eddie.

25:22.655 --> 25:24.889
      All right?
      It was a drug dealer
      named julien dupont.

25:24.891 --> 25:26.023
     The guy the kids call
     "the candyman."

25:26.025 --> 25:27.658
    They found their remains
    at the house.

25:27.660 --> 25:29.894
    Look, i'm telling you it
    wasn't them, all right?

25:29.896 --> 25:32.196
    This dupont guy was
    wearing jerome's shoes.

25:32.198 --> 25:34.665
  He, he practically admitted
  to killing him.

25:34.667 --> 25:37.034
  The police, they're covering
  this up. Now,
  don't ask me why.

25:37.036 --> 25:40.504
     -The dna was verified.
     -Just listen, please.

25:40.506 --> 25:42.540
   All right? I saw something
   in the candyman's car

25:42.542 --> 25:44.475
  And it's gonna sound crazy,
  all right?

25:44.477 --> 25:47.244
    -But i know what i saw.
    -Okay.

25:47.246 --> 25:49.079
     There was an ice chest
     in the passenger seat.

25:50.182 --> 25:52.049
     It had a brain inside.

25:54.086 --> 25:56.253
        A human brain.
        I'm sure of it.

26:09.068 --> 26:10.568
     -You think i'm crazy.
     -No!

26:12.338 --> 26:14.438
         It's just that

26:14.440 --> 26:17.708
    If the man worked
    for a butcher shop
    like he told the police,

26:17.710 --> 26:20.578
     Then it seems logical
     the brains came
     from an animal.

26:20.580 --> 26:23.948
  No, no, no. I've been
  looking at pictures of human
  and cow brains for hours,

26:23.950 --> 26:26.450
   And yes, i know how crazy
   that sounds, but, liv,

26:26.452 --> 26:29.119
   A cow's brain
   is baseball-sized.
   That's not what this was!

26:30.957 --> 26:33.524
 I need someone to believe me.

26:33.526 --> 26:35.826
    I'd feel so much better
    if that someone was you.

26:37.363 --> 26:40.197
      I know how close you
      and jerome were,

26:40.199 --> 26:42.633
       How responsible
       you felt for him.

26:42.635 --> 26:45.169
   I think you holding on
   to this case is a way
   of you holding on to him.

26:51.477 --> 26:52.309
         You're right.

26:54.413 --> 26:57.581
    I don't want you to be,
    but you are.

26:57.583 --> 27:00.317
        I know it's not
        easy to let go.

27:00.319 --> 27:02.720
    I've... I've got to get
    my act together

27:02.722 --> 27:05.456
      'cause this...
      This isn't who i am.

27:05.458 --> 27:07.791
   You know, if i'm gonna get
   into a fight with
   a biker gang,

27:07.793 --> 27:09.560
  It should be because
  i accidentally knocked over

27:09.562 --> 27:11.729
      A row of their hogs
      outside a dive bar.

27:11.731 --> 27:13.263
        (clicks tongue)

27:13.265 --> 27:16.634
 Just promise me that you'll
 back off from this julien guy.

27:16.636 --> 27:17.468
           I promise.

27:19.772 --> 27:21.071
   You're a good friend, liv.

27:42.828 --> 27:45.596
   Liv: <i> Every time major</i>
  <i> calls me his friend, i ache.</i>

27:45.598 --> 27:48.132
  <i> I miss the "girl" modifier,</i>
  <i> but the truth is,</i>

27:48.134 --> 27:50.834
  <i> We were practically besties</i>
  <i> from the moment we met.</i>

27:50.836 --> 27:53.203
       <i> That's why we were</i>
       <i> so great together.</i>

27:53.205 --> 27:55.973
   <i> Underneath all the love</i>
   <i> and the desire to tear</i>
   <i> each other's clothes off,</i>

27:55.975 --> 27:59.510
 <i> Was the person</i>
 <i> i wanted to share</i>
 <i> every detail of my life with.</i>

27:59.512 --> 28:03.714
 <i> Without that, it's not really</i>
 <i> even a relationship, is it?</i>

28:03.716 --> 28:07.051
      <i> Is this just sex?</i>
      <i> Is that who you are?</i>
      <i> A zombie booty call?</i>

28:10.322 --> 28:14.124
  Sorry. I instinctively
  take off my shirt every time
  someone knocks at the door.

28:14.126 --> 28:15.225
       What are we doing?

28:20.032 --> 28:22.533
        I just finished
        dyeing my roots.

28:22.535 --> 28:25.235
 We can't all pull off
 the ethereal tinker bell look.

28:25.237 --> 28:29.039
    I'm not sure what you're
    up to, but it seems
    to involve spiraling.

28:29.041 --> 28:33.043
  We're not friends. Shouldn't
  friendship be the foundation
       of a relationship?

28:33.045 --> 28:38.048
 It should be the foundation
 of year two of a relationship
 and beyond, but right now,

28:38.050 --> 28:39.883
   What i really wanna do is
   spend epic amounts of time

28:39.885 --> 28:41.819
 Naked with you,
 and the friendship will come.

28:41.821 --> 28:43.721
  Would we even be together
  if we weren't both zombies?

28:43.723 --> 28:45.723
         Probably not.

28:45.725 --> 28:48.992
 My world was the music scene,
 you were an er doctor.

28:48.994 --> 28:50.928
   I suppose i could've od'd,
   would have been
   a hell of a meet-cute,

28:50.930 --> 28:53.731
    But what does it matter?
    Because

28:53.733 --> 28:55.866
       Here we are.
       Zombies together.

28:55.868 --> 28:56.934
          It matters.

28:57.403 --> 28:59.036
          It doesn't.

28:59.038 --> 29:01.905
  We have nothing in common
  other than being half-dead.

29:01.907 --> 29:04.608
   -That's not the basis
   of a healthy relationship.
   -I have a feeling

29:06.178 --> 29:08.011
      That the woman whose
      brain you ate

29:08.013 --> 29:09.747
   Never had a healthy
   relationship in her life.

29:09.749 --> 29:10.748
        How do you know
        it was a woman?

29:13.185 --> 29:15.619
       She's exhausting.

29:15.621 --> 29:18.555
 I thought that being
 a relationship and sex expert
 might be a little fun, but...

29:18.557 --> 29:19.623
       Sorry, excuse me.

29:19.625 --> 29:21.358
         A what expert?

29:23.629 --> 29:25.896
         (liv chuckles)

29:25.898 --> 29:27.531
           -Ohhh!
           -(kissing)

29:27.533 --> 29:29.366
      (breathing heavily)

29:35.708 --> 29:36.707
      -(chuckles)
      -(breathing heavily)

29:39.278 --> 29:41.845
  -(panting)
  -sasha: Play it again, sam.

29:43.616 --> 29:44.681
            (gasps)

29:46.252 --> 29:47.050
              Sam?

29:50.222 --> 29:53.223
 Guy you're secretly
 pretending i am, or a vision?

29:53.225 --> 29:54.958
       A vision. A clue.

29:56.962 --> 29:58.028
      Then where were we?

30:02.735 --> 30:04.835
       So, who's the guy?

30:06.906 --> 30:08.839
        -Hmm?
        -Lowell tracey.

30:09.842 --> 30:11.675
      Oh? Broody musician.

30:12.611 --> 30:14.745
      Not your usual type.

30:14.747 --> 30:17.414
   But, you know, you're not
   the usual liv, are you?

30:17.416 --> 30:19.416
    You're looking at
    the new normal, sister.

30:19.418 --> 30:22.986
     Well, if you're happy,
     i'm happy for you.

30:22.988 --> 30:26.590
 -Even though i still think you
 belong with someone else.
 -Enough about me.

30:26.592 --> 30:29.226
    Who have you been
    sailing with lately and
    how big is his boat?

30:31.130 --> 30:34.198
      (chuckles) wow.
      A size joke, really?

30:34.200 --> 30:36.333
     Oh, gosh,
     you've changed. Um...

30:38.037 --> 30:41.171
      Actually,
      the harbor is empty.

30:41.173 --> 30:43.841
  I mean, there's this startup
  guy alex who keeps calling,

30:43.843 --> 30:47.044
  And i'm supposed to meet up
  with paolo when the sounders
  get back from germany.

30:47.046 --> 30:50.848
 Shannon hargens still asks me
 out every time i kick his ass
     in court. (chuckles)

30:50.850 --> 30:55.319
    Honestly though, i would
    rather kick ass in court
      than see any of them.

30:55.321 --> 30:57.154
        Sasha: <i> Give a guy</i>
       <i> some direction.</i>

30:57.156 --> 31:00.557
<i> If you're too shy to tell him</i>
<i> where he can and can't put it,</i>

31:00.559 --> 31:03.527
<i> You can't complain if it goes</i>
<i> where you don't want it to go.</i>

31:04.530 --> 31:06.630
           What's up?

31:06.632 --> 31:08.966
 We've been in here for
 an hour and 41 minutes.
 Do i really have to ask again?

31:10.870 --> 31:12.736
      Is she or is she not
      dating someone?

31:12.738 --> 31:15.906
 A tech wunderkind,
 a professional soccer player,

31:15.908 --> 31:17.708
     And a future
     supreme court justice.

31:17.710 --> 31:18.775
    So she's still looking.

31:20.246 --> 31:21.678
         Straight talk?

31:21.680 --> 31:23.313
      I don't think
      you and peyton work.

31:23.315 --> 31:26.083
 True, you like a challenge
 and peyton is certainly that,

31:26.085 --> 31:29.419
 But she dates guys you'd find
 in a "most eligible bachelors
    on the planet" catalog,

31:29.421 --> 31:31.889
    If such a thing existed.

31:31.891 --> 31:35.092
   And you don't think i'd be
   featured in the pages
   of <i> hunks quarterly?</i>

31:35.094 --> 31:38.161
 Ravi, she's a lawyer who looks
 like victoria's secret model.

31:38.163 --> 31:41.398
     Liv, i'm a tall doctor
     with fantastic hair
     and a british accent.

31:41.400 --> 31:44.167
    But to hear you tell it,
    she's out of my league.

31:44.169 --> 31:46.169
  I mean, i don't even
  need to be this attractive.

31:46.772 --> 31:48.338
        It's just icing.

31:48.340 --> 31:49.740
     Besides, peyton and i,

31:51.343 --> 31:53.210
        We had a moment.

31:53.212 --> 31:56.046
 I'm sure that's how it seemed,
 but i've known peyton
 since college,

31:56.048 --> 32:00.250
   And literally, every man
   who's ever met her thought
   that they had a moment.

32:00.252 --> 32:02.619
   I've been a witness to all
   those poor guys who
   liked a challenge.

32:02.621 --> 32:06.957
 I've watched them approach
 her table, full of hope. I've
 seen her turn them into dust.

32:06.959 --> 32:10.093
     She's been asked out
     so much, she doesn't
     bother with niceties.

32:10.095 --> 32:11.061
     -Just trying to help.
     -Thank you.

32:11.063 --> 32:12.596
       You know, i, uh...

32:12.598 --> 32:15.565
    I rescind all inquiries
    into the subject.

32:15.567 --> 32:19.369
   You know, i'm a grown man
   who knows a moment
   when he experiences one.

32:19.371 --> 32:22.272
 Oh, and my "distant parents"?

32:22.274 --> 32:23.840
   They're fairly certain
   i put the moon in the sky.

32:25.210 --> 32:27.678
     This brain you're on?
     She's a bit of an ass.

32:28.981 --> 32:30.113
 Thanks for the straight talk.

32:38.824 --> 32:42.292
 Liv: <i> The good thing about</i>
 <i> being forced to listen to</i>
 <i> hours of a relationship show?</i>

32:42.294 --> 32:44.828
<i> It cuts down on the awkward</i>
<i> silence after you've just done</i>

32:44.830 --> 32:47.631
<i> Possible irreparable damage</i>
<i> to a relationship of your own.</i>

32:49.902 --> 32:53.437
 Man: <i> The blues?</i>
 <i> Y'all come on down</i>
 <i> to s'il vous plait beignet...</i>

32:53.439 --> 32:55.172
  Woman: (in southern accent)
 <i> it's high time you experience</i>

32:55.174 --> 32:57.474
     <i> The warmth of our</i>
     <i> southern hospitality.</i>

32:57.476 --> 32:58.842
   Man: <i> Piping hot coffee...</i>

33:01.780 --> 33:04.481
   Chuck's mail-order gymnast
   has an alibi.

33:04.483 --> 33:06.717
 A dozen witnesses who saw her
 at a "booty boot camp."

33:08.520 --> 33:11.021
     -You look like you've
     got something.
     -Listen to this.

33:11.023 --> 33:12.689
       It's a commercial
       that ran last week

33:12.691 --> 33:14.624
   During <i> great morning sex.</i>
   I've got it cued up.

33:14.626 --> 33:16.626
         Man: <i> Got those</i>
        <i> rainy day blues?</i>

33:16.628 --> 33:19.496
  <i> Y'all come on down to</i>
   s'il vous plait, beignet...

33:19.498 --> 33:23.200
  Woman: <i> It's high time you</i>
  <i> experience the warmth</i>
  <i> of our southern hospitality.</i>

33:23.202 --> 33:25.002
   Man: <i> Piping hot coffee...</i>

33:25.004 --> 33:28.972
     -That woman's voice...
     -It's cheated on
     in chattanooga!

33:28.974 --> 33:31.274
  They should be able to
  tell us at the radio station
  who recorded it.

33:34.213 --> 33:36.646
    Sorry. Radio. Where even
    a memorial broadcast

33:36.648 --> 33:39.649
   Comes with a deadline
   and six commercial breaks.

33:39.651 --> 33:41.885
     -Did those last
     audio files help?
     -Listen for yourself.

33:47.826 --> 33:50.394
   Oh, my god. That's
   cheated on in chattanooga.

33:50.396 --> 33:52.195
     I should have
     recognized the voice.

33:52.197 --> 33:54.164
      So who recorded it?
      An ad agency?

33:54.166 --> 33:56.033
     Usually, but this time
     it was kaley.

33:56.035 --> 33:59.469
    -The assistant?
    -She did the temp track.

33:59.471 --> 34:02.873
  We mock ads up
  to pitch new customers,
  but kaley's southern accent

34:02.875 --> 34:06.743
  Was so good,
  the beignet people just kept
  her in the finished product.

34:06.745 --> 34:09.212
   -You don't think kaley...
   -Do you know where
   kaley is now?

34:09.214 --> 34:11.148
       Uh, home, i guess.
       It's her day off.

34:12.985 --> 34:14.051
       (knocking at door)

34:19.690 --> 34:20.757
          Detectives?

34:21.760 --> 34:23.726
       What do you want?

34:23.728 --> 34:25.862
   I don't know about him,
   but i'd like to experience

34:25.864 --> 34:28.197
     "the warmth of some
     southern hospitality."

34:28.199 --> 34:30.434
 Ms. Taylor, where were you at
 the time of sasha's murder?

34:30.436 --> 34:34.571
   I was on a coffee run
   getting sasha's emergency
   soy vanilla latte.

34:34.572 --> 34:37.407
 You have a receipt? Can anyone
 place you there? A barista?

34:37.409 --> 34:40.277
     I was in the car,
     on my way there,
     listening to the show.

34:40.279 --> 34:42.411
  When i heard the commotion,
  i turned around
  and i drove back.

34:42.414 --> 34:45.715
 So at the time of the murder,
 you say you were driving
 around on an errand

34:45.717 --> 34:48.752
  That you didn't complete,
  during which no one saw you?

34:48.754 --> 34:52.289
  That also gave you
  plenty of time to call in as
  cheated on in chattanooga.

34:52.291 --> 34:53.857
         What? What...

34:53.859 --> 34:55.192
   -What makes you think i...
   -Man: Hey, babe.

34:56.762 --> 34:58.195
        Everything okay?

34:58.197 --> 35:00.697
     "play it again, sam."

35:00.699 --> 35:03.733
   What makes us think you're
   cheated on in chattanooga?

35:03.735 --> 35:06.736
   We have a recording of you
   doing a southern accent
   in a commercial.

35:06.738 --> 35:10.040
   The boys at the police lab
   matched your voice
   to the cheated calls.

35:10.042 --> 35:12.843
   We also have an eyewitness
   to the affair between
   sasha and this man.

35:15.747 --> 35:17.447
    You were discreet, huh?

35:17.449 --> 35:20.050
        You had motive
        and opportunity.

35:20.052 --> 35:23.420
  You told the whole world
  you were gonna murder sasha.

35:23.422 --> 35:26.223
     I knew you were
     never gonna let it go.

35:26.225 --> 35:29.693
  Kaley taylor,
  you're under arrest for
  the murder of sasha arconi.

35:33.899 --> 35:36.566
  Sam and i were going through
  a rough time last year.

35:36.568 --> 35:39.903
  He got drunk at a work party
  and sasha seduced him.

35:39.905 --> 35:42.572
  Cheated on in chattanooga
  just seemed like a good way
  to mess with her head,

35:42.574 --> 35:44.241
       Get even, without
       ruining my career.

35:45.344 --> 35:47.777
       That's all it was.

35:47.779 --> 35:51.014
 You didn't think anybody would
 recognize the same fake accent
  you used in the beignet ads?

35:51.016 --> 35:54.451
    I'm from south carolina,
    that "fake accent,"

35:54.453 --> 35:56.686
  (in southern accent)
  that's my real voice, y'all.

35:56.688 --> 35:58.955
 And no, i didn't think anyone
 was gonna remember an ad that

35:58.957 --> 36:01.358
 Aired exactly once before
 the bakery folded a year ago.

36:01.360 --> 36:03.460
    The ad aired last week.
    We've got it on tape.

36:03.462 --> 36:04.928
      For a business that
      doesn't exist?

36:05.998 --> 36:07.030
       I highly doubt it.

36:09.801 --> 36:12.769
   So when you found out
   your husband and your boss
   were having these trysts,

36:12.771 --> 36:15.839
    You said nothing to her?
    You just hatched
    this elaborate plan?

36:15.841 --> 36:18.542
      If i had confronted
      sasha directly,

36:18.544 --> 36:20.677
   She would have blackballed
   me in the industry,
   like she did to jane.

36:20.679 --> 36:22.145
    Sasha blackballed jane?

36:22.147 --> 36:24.447
  When she found out
  jane was sending out tapes,

36:24.449 --> 36:27.484
 Sasha ran her down to
 the station managers in every
 top 100 market in the country.

36:27.486 --> 36:30.854
    Liv, she's right about
   <i> s'il vous plait, beignet.</i>

36:30.856 --> 36:33.190
  According to yelp, they
  shut their doors last year.

36:33.192 --> 36:37.027
  The only way that ad
  gets on the recording
  is if jane plants it there.

36:37.029 --> 36:38.361
      She wanted us
      to put it together.

36:38.363 --> 36:40.797
 Sasha destroyed jane's career.

36:40.799 --> 36:43.166
    Jane wanted to kill her.

36:43.168 --> 36:46.670
  Kaley's on-air death threat
  gave her the perfect
  opportunity.

36:46.672 --> 36:49.039
       -Where's jane now?
       -At the station,

36:49.041 --> 36:51.241
      Hosting sasha's
      memorial broadcast.

36:51.243 --> 36:54.811
     She's finally getting
     her big break.

36:54.813 --> 36:58.515
   Good evening and welcome.
   I'm jane bowman.

36:58.517 --> 37:00.383
  Tonight we'll be celebrating
  the life and work

37:00.385 --> 37:03.253
     Of sasha arconi,
     who is gone too soon.

37:04.389 --> 37:06.823
   <i> Sasha made us a community.</i>

37:06.825 --> 37:11.561
    A mutual support system.
    A sisterhood, linked
    by one voice.

37:11.563 --> 37:13.330
      <i> I hope you'll stick</i>
      <i> with me as i do</i>

37:13.332 --> 37:16.666
    My best to take the show
    into its second decade.

37:16.668 --> 37:19.336
  Give us a call here.
  Let's get it all out there.

37:19.338 --> 37:23.440
  Line one, you're on the air.
  What are you going to
  miss most about sasha?

37:23.442 --> 37:26.943
      Caller 1: <i> Everything,</i>
     <i> 'cause you suck.</i>

37:26.945 --> 37:31.214
  I know emotions are
  running high, but let's try
  to keep things positive.

37:31.216 --> 37:34.751
       -Line two.
       -(snoring loudly)
       (hangs up)

37:38.457 --> 37:41.124
   Jane: So, this must be how
   substitute teachers feel.

37:46.565 --> 37:50.267
   Looks like my tenure here
   won't be quite as long
   as i'd hoped,

37:50.269 --> 37:54.271
   I'll leave you, her
   adoring public, with this.

37:54.273 --> 37:56.072
      Sasha didn't care
      about our problems.

37:56.074 --> 37:58.275
    <i> Sasha cared about sasha.</i>
    <i> During commercials,</i>

37:58.277 --> 38:00.243
   <i> She'd laugh at the crazies</i>
   <i> who called in.</i>

38:00.245 --> 38:02.879
 She slept with our boyfriends
 and our husbands.

38:02.881 --> 38:05.582
   <i> And when i decided</i>
   <i> i wanted to live my dream</i>

38:05.584 --> 38:07.751
  <i> Of being in front of the mic</i>
  <i> instead of behind it,</i>

38:07.753 --> 38:10.620
   She destroyed my chances
   with every station manager
   on the west coast.

38:12.958 --> 38:15.659
   I was her biggest fan,
   and she killed my dreams.

38:17.929 --> 38:21.164
    <i> Well, i hope there's</i>
    <i> radio in hell and i hope</i>
    <i> you're listening, sasha.</i>

38:21.166 --> 38:22.932
     -Because you can go...
     -Jane bowman.

38:22.934 --> 38:26.403
  You're under arrest for
  the murder of sasha arconi.

38:26.405 --> 38:27.871
       Any last words
       for sasha's fans?

38:30.609 --> 38:31.875
        Jane lynch:
       <i> Bitch, get a clue!</i>

38:40.118 --> 38:42.952
       -(shower running)
       -i'm heading over
       to lowell's place.

38:42.954 --> 38:44.587
 -Peyton: Yeah, won't wait up.
 -(shower stops)

38:54.132 --> 38:55.999
      (cell phone ringing
      and vibrating)

39:00.305 --> 39:02.706
           Oh, ravi.

39:02.708 --> 39:05.408
 Peyton: Hey, can you get that
 for me? I'll be out in a sec.

39:09.514 --> 39:11.948
         -Peyton's phone.
        <i> -Liv?</i>

39:11.950 --> 39:14.384
  Is, uh... (clears throat)
  i'd like to speak to peyton.

39:14.386 --> 39:16.052
     Hi, ravi. Yeah, i'll,
     um, get her.

39:19.524 --> 39:22.325
          -It's ravi.
          -Who?

39:22.327 --> 39:23.760
     (whispering) my boss,
     from the morgue.

39:27.666 --> 39:29.132
     (whispering)
     oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
     British guy.

39:29.134 --> 39:30.834
              Hi.

39:30.836 --> 39:32.535
 Liv: <i> It's bad enough that i've</i>
<i> spent the past few days</i>

39:32.537 --> 39:34.537
     <i> Dispensing the advice</i>
     <i> of a hypocrite.</i>

39:34.539 --> 39:36.740
   <i> If i don't get out of here</i>
   <i> in the next three seconds,</i>

39:36.742 --> 39:38.475
       <i> I'm gonna witness</i>
       <i> a train wreck.</i>

39:38.477 --> 39:41.244
<i> Let this be a lesson.</i>
<i> Stay out of people's business.</i>

39:41.246 --> 39:43.213
<i> -Keep your advice to yourself.</i>
 -Hey, liv.

39:48.019 --> 39:50.153
   Um, your boss just, uh...

39:50.155 --> 39:50.987
      You should say yes.

39:50.989 --> 39:52.455
     Is that weird for you?

39:52.858 --> 39:53.923
             Do it.

39:55.761 --> 39:58.228
       Um, yes. That...
       That sounds great.

39:58.230 --> 40:02.198
  Liv: <i> Okay. So the pledge</i>
  <i> to keep my advice</i>
  <i> to myself didn't last long.</i>

40:02.200 --> 40:04.601
     <i> Maybe i'm too reticent</i>
     <i> on the advice front.</i>
     <i> What would i say?</i>

40:06.438 --> 40:09.372
      <i> Ravi, never</i>
      <i> listen to me again.</i>

40:09.374 --> 40:13.076
  <i> You are too selfless,</i>
  <i> too wrapped up in saving me.</i>

40:13.078 --> 40:15.745
   <i> Chill out. Slow and steady</i>
   <i> wins the race.</i>

40:15.747 --> 40:17.380
        <i> I can't have you</i>
        <i> burning out.</i>

40:17.382 --> 40:19.315
          Argh! Argh!

40:27.592 --> 40:29.426
   Liv: <i> Because without you,</i>

40:29.428 --> 40:30.493
          <i> I'm nothing.</i>

40:34.065 --> 40:35.732
          <i> And, major,</i>

40:35.734 --> 40:38.067
        <i> Don't lose sight</i>
        <i> of who you are.</i>

40:38.069 --> 40:40.870
       <i> You are sweetness</i>
       <i> and light.</i>

40:40.872 --> 40:43.106
       <i> That's who i fell</i>
       <i> in love with,</i>

40:43.108 --> 40:44.874
       <i> The next girl will</i>
       <i> fall in love with.</i>

40:49.915 --> 40:51.714
       <i> Don't pile tragedy</i>
       <i> on tragedy.</i>

41:01.226 --> 41:03.560
   <i> And what advice would you</i>
   <i> give yourself, liv?</i>

41:03.562 --> 41:05.495
    <i> -Would you even take it?</i>
     -(alarm beeping)

41:14.239 --> 41:16.506
    <i> How about trying to live</i>
    <i> in the moment for once?</i>

41:22.948 --> 41:25.014
     <i> Being grateful for</i>
     <i> the simple pleasures.</i>

41:32.624 --> 41:35.191
     <i> You don't need to know</i>
     <i> why you feel good.</i>

41:35.193 --> 41:36.526
      <i> Just enjoy the ride.</i>

41:48.607 --> 41:50.139
            Jerome!

41:50.141 --> 41:52.275
      Settle down, jerome.

41:52.277 --> 41:53.276
     It's not a long ride.

41:53.812 --> 41:54.878
            (gasps)

41:59.851 --> 42:01.484
      (breathing heavily)

42:01.486 --> 42:02.418
     (elevator door opens)
