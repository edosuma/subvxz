01:37.622 --> 01:39.872
24, 26.

01:39.956 --> 01:41.080
Oh, my God.

01:41.165 --> 01:44.371
Joni, there are so many hotties
in your class.

01:45.206 --> 01:47.538
You are so gonna hook up
the first week.

01:47.622 --> 01:50.413
Just because you're a 24-hour drive-thru
doesn't mean everyone else has to be.

01:50.497 --> 01:52.329
Hey,
she worked her ass off.

01:52.414 --> 01:55.913
She deserves
some hot jock sausage.

01:55.998 --> 01:57.621
Gross.
That's disgusting.

01:58.748 --> 02:01.205
Why don't you guys just do it and
get it over with?

02:03.581 --> 02:05.122
What? I'm just saying.

02:06.497 --> 02:08.205
Maybe because
we're friends.

02:10.205 --> 02:11.997
B minus
in geometry, dude.

02:12.081 --> 02:14.329
This shit is the bomb.

02:19.497 --> 02:20.872
Add that shit up.

02:20.956 --> 02:23.080
Don't be
such a bitch, dude.

02:26.914 --> 02:27.997
Yeah.

02:32.581 --> 02:35.496
Hey, ladies! Come on,
take it down a notch.

02:37.206 --> 02:39.371
Hey! Hey!
What did I just say, huh?

02:39.456 --> 02:42.580
Come here. Come here, big boy.
Let's see what you got.

02:42.664 --> 02:43.997
Come on, get him!

02:44.664 --> 02:47.080
Come on, what you got?
Let's see it. Come on.

02:47.165 --> 02:49.705
Come on, Dad. Your pits smell
like burnt ass.

02:50.497 --> 02:51.663
Burnt ass? CLAY: Yeah.

02:54.289 --> 02:56.913
Get out of here.
Take it to his house.

03:11.622 --> 03:14.538
Laser, cut it out.
That's driving me crazy.

03:14.622 --> 03:15.830
I'm not doing anything.
Calm down.

03:15.914 --> 03:17.496
You calm down.

03:17.914 --> 03:19.122
Hi, guys.

03:19.205 --> 03:20.413
Hey, babe.

03:20.497 --> 03:22.413
Hey, Mom.
Sorry I'm late.

03:22.497 --> 03:23.830
No, don't worry.
We just started.

03:24.497 --> 03:25.580
Come on.
That's enough.

03:25.664 --> 03:28.413
Oh, my God.
27 fibroids.

03:28.497 --> 03:29.830
All in the lining.

03:29.914 --> 03:31.122
That's disgusting.

03:31.205 --> 03:33.122
Yeah.
We're eating.

03:34.664 --> 03:36.913
Wow. Did they do that
laparoscopically?

03:36.998 --> 03:39.329
That's right, smart girl.
We got them all.

03:39.414 --> 03:40.997
Hey, whose truck is that?

03:41.081 --> 03:42.413
Mine.

03:43.372 --> 03:44.455
Yours?

03:44.539 --> 03:46.080
Isn't it wicked?

03:46.165 --> 03:47.164
Mmm-hmm.

03:47.539 --> 03:49.455
For the business.

03:49.539 --> 03:51.038
What business?

03:53.372 --> 03:55.204
Oh, you mean
the gardening?

03:56.581 --> 03:57.997
Isn't it landscape design?

03:58.081 --> 04:00.246
Thank you very much.

04:00.330 --> 04:02.913
I got a great deal.
It was super cheap.

04:02.998 --> 04:06.080
Okay. Do we have any
more of the Fiddlehead?

04:06.164 --> 04:08.788
I don't know.
I didn't look, honey.

04:12.831 --> 04:14.413
Hey, what's up?
Yo, what's up, dude?

04:14.497 --> 04:16.204
Laser, no phone calls
at the table, all right?

04:16.289 --> 04:18.413
Dude, I shaved my dog.

04:18.497 --> 04:19.579
Are you still feeling it?

04:19.664 --> 04:20.747
Yeah. Hey,
let me hit you back.

04:20.831 --> 04:21.913
For sure.

04:21.998 --> 04:23.413
Who's that?

04:23.497 --> 04:25.913
That was nobody.
Just Clay.

04:28.539 --> 04:30.122
Can I ask you something?

04:30.205 --> 04:33.747
What do you get from your relationship
with Clay?

04:33.831 --> 04:35.080
What do you mean "get"?

04:35.164 --> 04:38.413
Well, we just feel like
he's a little untended.

04:38.497 --> 04:42.663
Do you think he's the kind of person
who's gonna help you grow?

04:43.414 --> 04:47.204
Hey, did you get started on those
thank-you notes for the birthday presents?

04:47.289 --> 04:48.663
Mom, you're windshield wiping.
Come on.

04:48.748 --> 04:50.080
Not yet, but I will.
Okay.

04:50.164 --> 04:52.246
I just think it's better to knock them out
when it's fresh.

04:52.330 --> 04:54.329
Yeah, I'll do
them tonight.

04:54.414 --> 04:57.413
I mean, you don't want to have to
start with an apology. You know?

04:57.497 --> 04:58.747
Then it's embarrassing.

04:58.831 --> 05:00.580
Mom, I know.

05:00.664 --> 05:02.080
It's okay, honey.
She got it.

05:02.164 --> 05:03.496
Let it go.

05:04.622 --> 05:07.329
Okay. I'll let it go.

05:09.956 --> 05:11.788
I mean,
if it was up to you,

05:11.873 --> 05:13.872
our kids wouldn't even write
thank-you notes.

05:13.956 --> 05:15.913
You know, they'd just
send out good vibes.

05:15.998 --> 05:17.455
That's not nice.

05:22.581 --> 05:23.997
Do you believe
our baby's 18?

05:24.080 --> 05:25.455
No, I can't.

05:25.539 --> 05:26.580
You big girl.

05:26.664 --> 05:27.747
Such a big girl.

05:27.831 --> 05:30.371
Big girl. Big girl.

05:30.456 --> 05:31.621
Mom.
What?

05:33.497 --> 05:34.872
Oh. Thank you.

05:38.873 --> 05:40.496
Hey.
Hey.

05:41.748 --> 05:43.496
What are you doing?

05:43.581 --> 05:44.747
Writing my thank-you notes.

05:44.831 --> 05:45.872
That's good.

05:45.956 --> 05:47.705
You know, you don't have to start
with an apology.

05:47.789 --> 05:48.747
Yeah, that'd
be embarrassing.

05:48.831 --> 05:49.913
That's terrible.

05:51.664 --> 05:57.204
Hey, have you thought any more about
making that call?

05:58.164 --> 06:00.038
Yeah, I don't want to.

06:00.122 --> 06:02.121
How can you not even
be curious about it?

06:02.205 --> 06:06.747
Look, I'm leaving soon, and I don't
want to have to deal with that right now.

06:06.831 --> 06:09.121
Also, that could really
hurt Mom's feelings.

06:09.205 --> 06:11.413
God, why do you have to worry about
them so much?

06:11.497 --> 06:13.538
They don't even
have to know about it.

06:13.622 --> 06:16.538
Look, you can do it
when you turn 18, okay?

06:17.497 --> 06:19.496
I never ask you
for anything.

06:27.330 --> 06:30.538
I just don't understand
why you bought the truck now.

06:30.622 --> 06:32.413
Because if I'm gonna
start this business,

06:32.497 --> 06:34.913
I need something
to haul my equipment in.

06:34.998 --> 06:38.329
Okay. It just seems a little
cart before the horse.

06:38.414 --> 06:40.121
What does that mean?

06:40.205 --> 06:43.747
Well, sweetie, you don't have
any clients yet.

06:43.831 --> 06:44.830
You know,

06:46.038 --> 06:49.329
you're the one who's always
telling me to act "as if."

06:51.080 --> 06:53.830
That's true. I do.
You're right.

06:56.456 --> 07:00.121
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's good you bought the truck.

07:01.205 --> 07:03.371
It's proactive.
Yeah.

07:06.748 --> 07:10.037
Hey, you wanna
watch a movie?

07:10.122 --> 07:12.496
A movie-movie?

07:12.581 --> 07:15.246
Yeah. We haven't
done that in a while.

07:17.956 --> 07:19.288
All right.

08:00.997 --> 08:03.329
You know, I don't
like the guys in this one.

08:03.414 --> 08:04.830
They're too shaved.

08:04.914 --> 08:06.705
Don't focus on it.

08:06.789 --> 08:07.996
Okay.

08:24.122 --> 08:26.246
Fuck. Oh, my God.

08:26.330 --> 08:27.872
Hey, hey, I'm cold.

08:27.955 --> 08:29.246
I can't
breathe, honey.

08:29.330 --> 08:30.371
Well...

08:30.456 --> 08:31.496
Shit!

08:32.164 --> 08:33.246
Shit!

08:35.621 --> 08:38.538
Where's the remote?
Where's the remote?

08:41.038 --> 08:42.413
Oh, my God.

08:43.539 --> 08:44.872
The whole neighborhood
heard that.

08:44.955 --> 08:46.580
No, they didn't.

08:46.664 --> 08:48.621
Shit.

08:48.706 --> 08:50.538
That was a vibe kill.

09:02.164 --> 09:04.496
Hey, hey, Brooke,
can you do me a favor?

09:04.581 --> 09:06.329
Can you get that
Swiss chard for me?

09:06.414 --> 09:07.705
Sure, no problem.

09:07.789 --> 09:08.996
Thanks.

09:40.622 --> 09:42.580
How are you?
Hey, Paul.

09:46.706 --> 09:48.037
Hey, foxy.

09:48.706 --> 09:49.912
Hey.

09:50.205 --> 09:51.288
Mmm.

09:51.372 --> 09:52.912
Flapjack, you are
smelling ripe.

09:52.997 --> 09:54.037
Oh, sorry.

09:54.122 --> 09:55.829
That's all right.
I kind of like it.

09:55.913 --> 09:57.747
Oh, yeah?
It's earthy.

09:57.830 --> 09:59.580
I've been out
in the garden hoeing.

10:00.830 --> 10:02.496
How are we doing tonight?
It's gonna be tight.

10:02.581 --> 10:04.455
Oh, really?

10:04.539 --> 10:05.954
Go to work.

10:07.789 --> 10:08.912
See you.

10:09.706 --> 10:10.747
Hello?

10:10.830 --> 10:12.580
Hi.
Is this Paul Hatfield?

10:13.581 --> 10:15.621
Yes, it is. Who's this?

10:15.706 --> 10:19.829
My name is Wendy Mitner,
and I'm calling from The Pacific Cryobank.

10:19.913 --> 10:21.954
Okay, Wendy Mitner.
What can I do for you?

10:22.038 --> 10:24.621
I just need to confirm that
this is the same Paul Hatfield

10:24.706 --> 10:28.538
that donated sperm with us
between 1991 and 1993.

10:30.164 --> 10:32.996
Yeah, I did a little bit
of that back then, sure.

10:33.080 --> 10:36.163
Well, as you know, the Cryobank has a
confidentiality policy

10:36.247 --> 10:38.455
which prohibits us
from releasing your identity

10:38.539 --> 10:40.371
without your consent.

10:43.497 --> 10:45.705
No... Yeah, yeah,
yeah, I knew that.

10:45.788 --> 10:47.037
Well, we've been contacted

10:47.122 --> 10:49.413
by a young woman
conceived using your donation,

10:49.497 --> 10:53.246
and she's asked if you'd be open to
having contact with her.

10:56.330 --> 10:59.746
Yeah, I'd be conceivably into something
like that. Yeah.

10:59.830 --> 11:03.912
Great, Mr. Hatfield. I'll let her know and
get back in touch soon.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.163
Thanks.

11:08.164 --> 11:09.538
Oh...

11:21.414 --> 11:22.787
I mean,
I was 19 years old.

11:22.872 --> 11:25.288
It was, like, just so long ago.
I totally forgot about it.

11:25.372 --> 11:27.413
I never thought
they'd ever use my stuff.

11:27.497 --> 11:28.538
Why not?

11:28.622 --> 11:29.746
Well, I'd use it.

11:29.830 --> 11:31.037
Oh, baby.

11:32.372 --> 11:33.455
It's weird.

11:34.080 --> 11:39.121
There's a kid out there.
I mean, I'm kind of curious, I think.

11:39.205 --> 11:40.996
Yeah?
Yeah.

11:41.080 --> 11:43.079
So what are you gonna do?

11:43.164 --> 11:44.329
I don't know.
What would you do?

11:44.955 --> 11:46.121
I don't know.

11:46.205 --> 11:47.288
You got to figure it out.

11:47.372 --> 11:49.121
Yeah, no doubt.

11:51.080 --> 11:53.204
All right, I got to go now.
All right.

11:53.289 --> 11:55.912
Thanks for coming.
It was really nice.

11:58.038 --> 11:59.871
I'll see you tomorrow.

11:59.955 --> 12:01.496
So, drive safe.

12:12.497 --> 12:15.246
M-E-R. "Zoomer."

12:15.330 --> 12:16.413
No way.

12:16.497 --> 12:17.496
That is so not a word.

12:17.581 --> 12:18.662
No, it totally is.

12:18.705 --> 12:20.163
That's not a word.
If you're gonna zoom somewhere,

12:20.247 --> 12:21.787
then you're a zoomer.
A person who zooms.

12:22.955 --> 12:24.079
So that would be...
Let's see, that's 31...

12:24.164 --> 12:25.246
Hello?

12:25.330 --> 12:27.329
Hi.
I'm looking for Joni Allgood.

12:27.414 --> 12:28.996
Yeah, this is she.

12:30.330 --> 12:31.912
Hey.

12:31.997 --> 12:35.204
This is Paul, your donor.

12:35.289 --> 12:36.580
Eleven points
for Mommy.

12:36.663 --> 12:38.163
Oh! H i.

12:39.330 --> 12:41.787
Hey. Don't be a zoomer.

12:41.872 --> 12:42.912
Hey.

12:42.997 --> 12:44.037
Come back.

12:44.122 --> 12:45.580
Is this a good time to talk?

12:45.663 --> 12:47.538
Yeah. No,
this is great.

12:47.622 --> 12:51.871
So, how are you?
How are you?

12:51.955 --> 12:53.496
I'm good.
How are you?

12:53.581 --> 12:54.871
I'm well, thanks.

12:56.164 --> 12:58.787
Wendy at the Cryobank

12:59.788 --> 13:02.246
was talking about maybe...

13:02.330 --> 13:03.538
Oh, yeah. Well.

13:03.621 --> 13:05.954
Actually, my brother
asked if I'd call you,

13:06.038 --> 13:08.662
because I'm 18,
and he's only 15, which is,

13:08.747 --> 13:10.704
you know, which is
too young to call.

13:10.788 --> 13:13.204
Anyway, he'd like
to meet you.

13:13.289 --> 13:14.496
You know,
if you want to.

13:14.581 --> 13:16.704
Your brother?

13:16.788 --> 13:19.871
Yeah. Well, technically
he's my half-brother.

13:19.955 --> 13:23.246
Each of my moms had a kid,
you know, with...

13:23.330 --> 13:24.871
With your...
With your sperm.

13:25.539 --> 13:26.912
Like in both of them?

13:26.997 --> 13:28.163
Yeah.

13:28.247 --> 13:29.580
Like in two?

13:29.663 --> 13:31.163
U h-huh. Like in gay.

13:32.372 --> 13:34.704
Oh! Right. Right.
Right on.

13:34.788 --> 13:37.413
Right on.
Yeah, cool. I...

13:37.497 --> 13:39.079
I love lesbians.

13:42.247 --> 13:43.746
Great.
So you wanna,

13:43.830 --> 13:47.871
I don't know, get a bite to eat or
something? You and your brother?

13:56.330 --> 13:58.871
I just don't want you
to have big expectations.

13:58.955 --> 14:01.246
Will you quit saying that?
I have no expectations, all right?

14:01.330 --> 14:04.871
Okay. I'm just saying.
He might be weird.

14:04.955 --> 14:08.746
I mean, he donated sperm.
That's weird.

14:08.830 --> 14:12.662
Well, you know, if he hadn't, we wouldn't
be here, so respect.

14:26.497 --> 14:27.829
Hello?

14:29.414 --> 14:30.662
Hey. Hey.

14:31.705 --> 14:33.413
You're Joni, right?
Hi, I'm Joni.

14:33.497 --> 14:35.163
I'm Paul. N ice to meet you.
N ice to meet you.

14:35.247 --> 14:36.912
You must be Laser?
Laser, yeah.

14:36.997 --> 14:38.662
Right on.
That's a very cool name.

14:38.747 --> 14:39.912
Thanks.

14:39.997 --> 14:41.246
Well...

14:41.955 --> 14:43.079
Cool.

14:44.122 --> 14:46.079
Yeah. Yeah.

14:46.164 --> 14:50.163
Listen, you know, feel free
to ask me anything, anything you want.

14:51.289 --> 14:53.329
Cool, thanks. Yeah.
Cool.

14:56.788 --> 15:01.704
Laser, do you have
any questions that you wanna ask?

15:01.788 --> 15:02.871
Go ahead, shoot.
Anything.

15:02.955 --> 15:07.455
I didn't really have any, you know,
specific questions or anything, so...

15:07.538 --> 15:08.579
Nothing?

15:08.663 --> 15:10.746
Not really.

15:10.830 --> 15:13.204
Well, I mean, I'd love to know more
about you guys.

15:13.289 --> 15:15.079
Everything. I mean...

15:15.164 --> 15:17.996
So what do you do, Joni?
What are you into?

15:19.747 --> 15:23.537
I just graduated high school, and I'm
starting college in the fall, so...

15:23.621 --> 15:25.079
Hey, that's great.
Congratulations.

15:25.164 --> 15:26.246
Thanks.

15:26.330 --> 15:28.246
Yeah,
Joni's the brains in the family.

15:28.330 --> 15:31.121
She's got the National
Merit Scholarship for science.

15:31.205 --> 15:32.537
Shut the front door.

15:32.621 --> 15:33.912
Okay, Laser, thanks.

15:33.997 --> 15:35.662
Wow.
I'm just telling him you're smart.

15:35.747 --> 15:38.079
No, I just work
harder than you.

15:39.247 --> 15:42.163
Hey, Laze, seriously,
don't sweat school, man.

15:42.247 --> 15:47.537
I mean, I didn't do well in school either,
and I'm not doing so badly now, right?

15:48.788 --> 15:50.996
It's Laser. Yeah.

15:52.205 --> 15:55.204
Sorry. Laser. Right.

15:55.289 --> 15:56.579
It's cool.

15:56.663 --> 15:59.163
So, what are you
into, Laser?

16:00.330 --> 16:01.871
Laser's an amazing athlete.

16:01.955 --> 16:03.662
Really? Yeah?

16:04.289 --> 16:06.204
Did you ever play
any sports in school or...

16:06.289 --> 16:08.912
I did a little
B... ball in junior high.

16:08.997 --> 16:11.371
That's cool.
Was that it or...

16:11.455 --> 16:14.413
Well, the whole "team" thing just got
on my nerves after a while, you know?

16:14.496 --> 16:17.954
It was like, "Hey, let's go kick some
ass, man! " And...

16:19.164 --> 16:20.329
What about you?

16:21.830 --> 16:25.871
I play soccer,
basketball, baseball.

16:25.955 --> 16:28.579
You know,
all the team sort of sports.

16:28.663 --> 16:29.704
Hey, man,

16:29.788 --> 16:32.495
I wasn't generally
bagging on teams.

16:32.580 --> 16:35.746
I mean, teams are great.
I'm just weird that way.

16:35.830 --> 16:38.163
I like teams.
They're cool.

16:38.913 --> 16:40.204
Cool.

16:41.663 --> 16:43.329
So this is your
place, right?

16:43.413 --> 16:45.121
Yeah, yeah, this is mine.
It's cool.

16:45.205 --> 16:46.662
You know,
I've been working on it for a while.

16:46.747 --> 16:51.495
I also have a little organic co-op
farm just up the street here.

16:51.580 --> 16:54.912
Just keeping it kind
of local and organic

16:54.997 --> 16:56.371
and simple,
American food.

16:56.455 --> 16:58.495
That's so cool.
I'm totally into local.

16:59.705 --> 17:01.163
Yeah?
You are?

17:02.955 --> 17:04.121
Yeah, Laser.

17:04.204 --> 17:08.494
I've been trying to get
Moms, you know, to buy local for ages.

17:12.371 --> 17:13.704
All right.

17:15.663 --> 17:17.704
We're just over here. There.
Right. Yeah.

17:17.788 --> 17:19.412
Okay.

17:19.496 --> 17:20.829
Is that your bike?

17:20.913 --> 17:22.746
Yeah, yeah.
You like motorcycles?

17:22.829 --> 17:25.746
Yeah, I love them,

17:25.829 --> 17:29.163
but, you know, our moms are kind
of anti-motorcycle.

17:29.247 --> 17:31.996
By "kind of" he means that they'd
kill us if we ever rode one, so...

17:32.080 --> 17:33.787
Oh, that's too bad.
They're a lot of fun.

17:33.872 --> 17:35.329
Yeah, I'm sure.

17:37.955 --> 17:38.996
Cool.

17:39.080 --> 17:40.204
Cool.
Yeah.

17:41.164 --> 17:43.329
It was great...
Great meeting you, yeah.

17:43.413 --> 17:44.620
N ice to meet you, too.

17:44.705 --> 17:46.163
Yeah. It's okay,
right? Good?

17:46.247 --> 17:47.329
Yeah, for sure.

17:47.413 --> 17:48.579
Hey, Laser,
really nice to meet you.

17:48.663 --> 17:50.746
Yeah, you too.

17:51.663 --> 17:52.746
All right.
All right.

17:52.830 --> 17:53.829
So long.

17:53.913 --> 17:55.079
Bye.

17:55.164 --> 17:56.288
Keep in touch.
Yeah.

17:56.371 --> 17:57.787
Okay?
Yeah.

18:06.997 --> 18:11.246
Wow. I just never pictured him
that way, you know?

18:11.329 --> 18:13.704
He was so cool
and interesting.

18:13.788 --> 18:15.328
Yeah, he's all right.

18:16.872 --> 18:18.037
What do you mean
"all right"?

18:19.830 --> 18:22.662
Laser, you're the one
who wanted to meet him so bad.

18:22.747 --> 18:24.246
I know.

18:24.329 --> 18:26.662
Yeah, so what did
you think of him?

18:26.747 --> 18:28.079
I think he's all right.

18:28.164 --> 18:30.871
I mean, I think he's
a little into himself.

18:32.080 --> 18:33.704
God.
What?

18:33.788 --> 18:35.454
You're asking my opinion.
Whatever.

18:35.538 --> 18:37.537
We are so not telling Moms.

18:37.621 --> 18:38.829
Why not?

18:38.913 --> 18:40.121
Ha, ha. Very funny.

18:42.288 --> 18:43.787
He wants to die!

18:44.997 --> 18:46.163
He wants to die.

18:46.621 --> 18:48.871
Remind me not to take
heroin in Morocco. Or Uganda.

18:48.955 --> 18:52.246
Yeah. I hate it
when that happens.

18:52.329 --> 18:55.662
...it is now time to call it.

18:55.747 --> 18:59.412
Someone took my knife.
I want my knife back!

19:00.997 --> 19:02.912
Hey, bug, come here.

19:02.997 --> 19:04.079
We're watching
Locked Up Abroad.

19:04.164 --> 19:05.246
I want my knife back!

19:05.329 --> 19:06.412
Yeah, I've seen
that one. It's good.

19:06.496 --> 19:07.746
Where you going?

19:07.830 --> 19:09.328
Clay's.

19:09.413 --> 19:10.412
Don't be back late.

19:10.496 --> 19:11.537
I know, I know, I know.

19:11.621 --> 19:13.412
Hey, hey. Come give us
a hug before you go.

19:13.496 --> 19:14.454
Hugs.
Come on.

19:14.538 --> 19:15.537
No, Mom.

19:15.621 --> 19:17.537
Hug her. That's what
she's there for.

19:24.080 --> 19:27.912
Maybe we should
just sit him down and ask him already.

19:27.997 --> 19:30.912
What? "Are you
and Clay fucking?"

19:30.997 --> 19:33.328
"Exploring" is
a better word.

19:33.413 --> 19:35.245
Yeah, well, so, you know,
what if they are "exploring"?

19:35.329 --> 19:37.746
This is the age for that.

19:37.830 --> 19:39.037
We should be
good with that.

19:39.122 --> 19:40.245
We should. We should.

19:40.329 --> 19:42.912
I just don't understand
why he's exploring with that loser.

19:42.997 --> 19:46.328
We don't really know what's going on.
We shouldn't jump to conclusions.

19:46.413 --> 19:49.746
I feel like he has so much potential.
He's just wasting it.

19:52.913 --> 19:54.871
What are you
trying to say?

19:56.038 --> 19:57.328
What do you mean,
what am I trying to say?

19:57.413 --> 20:00.079
I just, you know,
I feel like there's some subtext here.

20:00.164 --> 20:01.203
What are you
talking about?

20:01.288 --> 20:03.412
You know,
"like mother, like son"?

20:03.496 --> 20:08.996
Both of us wandering in the dark,
aimless, "wasting our potential."

20:09.080 --> 20:12.287
Honey, you're on
a whole other tangent.

20:12.371 --> 20:14.412
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

20:14.496 --> 20:19.163
Well, you know, maybe it hasn't risen to
the plane of consciousness for you yet.

20:22.580 --> 20:23.996
Yeah. Maybe.

20:30.288 --> 20:32.203
Someone took my knife.

20:32.288 --> 20:34.121
So what were they like?

20:34.204 --> 20:36.203
They were
really sweet kids.

20:36.288 --> 20:42.121
The boy was this little, you know,
kind of sensitive jock-type kid,

20:42.204 --> 20:44.912
and the girl was
really innocent

20:44.997 --> 20:49.579
but just whip-smart
and super, super cute.

20:49.663 --> 20:52.662
Sounds like you really liked them,
like you guys connected.

20:54.621 --> 20:57.954
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I kind of did.

20:59.455 --> 21:01.328
Wow.
So how'd you leave it?

21:01.413 --> 21:02.787
I mean, are you
gonna see them again?

21:02.872 --> 21:04.079
I... Hey, Brooke.

21:04.163 --> 21:05.537
Hey, Paul.
Check these out.

21:05.621 --> 21:06.912
How you doing?
Good.

21:06.997 --> 21:08.871
Wow, look at those
strawberries, man.

21:08.955 --> 21:09.912
They're just...

21:09.997 --> 21:11.079
Aren't they beautiful?

21:11.163 --> 21:12.829
I thought you should
have the first taste.

21:13.288 --> 21:14.495
Thank you.

21:18.830 --> 21:22.203
"I thought you should
have the first taste" of my pussy.

21:23.496 --> 21:24.829
I'm sorry.

21:28.246 --> 21:29.746
Dude, I don't even
think they smoke pot.

21:29.830 --> 21:31.829
Dude, hold up.

21:37.997 --> 21:40.162
Come on, let's go.
Seriously.

21:42.329 --> 21:43.412
Oh! Dude!

21:43.496 --> 21:44.871
God, disgusting!
Come on, let's go.

21:44.955 --> 21:46.079
It's alive, dude!

21:46.163 --> 21:47.245
Put it back.

21:47.329 --> 21:48.746
Fine, fine, fine.

21:49.913 --> 21:50.996
Sweet!

21:52.080 --> 21:54.120
Dude, we're watching this.

22:04.413 --> 22:07.579
You think the whole
thing's like this?

22:07.663 --> 22:10.078
Maybe...

22:10.163 --> 22:12.412
Maybe we should
fast forward.

22:30.621 --> 22:33.996
Laser, you left your bike
in the driveway again.

22:40.163 --> 22:44.120
Laser, your mom and I accept and
love you unconditionally.

22:44.204 --> 22:46.328
You know that, right?

22:46.413 --> 22:47.537
Yeah.

22:47.621 --> 22:52.078
Yeah. And you know that you can be
open with us about anything.

22:53.329 --> 22:55.412
Yeah, I know.
Okay.

22:55.496 --> 22:59.454
Laser, do you want to talk to us
about anything?

22:59.538 --> 23:00.620
Like what?

23:00.705 --> 23:01.787
J ust anything.

23:01.872 --> 23:04.537
You know, anything
on your mind.

23:05.830 --> 23:10.996
Well, there is something.
But it's more of a question, though.

23:11.079 --> 23:12.245
That's okay.

23:12.329 --> 23:14.287
We won't judge you.

23:16.496 --> 23:19.495
Why do you guys
watch gay man porn?

23:21.830 --> 23:26.662
Well, first I have to say
that we rarely watch that movie.

23:26.747 --> 23:27.912
Honey.

23:27.996 --> 23:30.245
And, second,
I really don't appreciate

23:30.329 --> 23:31.995
you snooping around
our room, okay?

23:32.079 --> 23:33.954
Was that Clay's idea?
No, Mom.

23:34.037 --> 23:36.412
Wait a minute.
I have to say, again, I don't like him.

23:36.496 --> 23:37.746
I know. I know.

23:37.830 --> 23:39.662
Okay, he seems unstable.

23:39.747 --> 23:41.620
Honey, honey,
that's not what he asked.

23:41.705 --> 23:43.162
Do you want to answer
his question?

23:43.246 --> 23:44.620
Yeah, okay.

23:46.163 --> 23:50.203
Well, sweetie, you know,
human sexuality is complicated.

23:50.288 --> 23:54.579
And sometimes desire can be,
you know, counterintuitive.

23:54.663 --> 23:56.412
You know, for example,

23:56.496 --> 24:00.203
because women's
sexual responsiveness is internalized,

24:00.288 --> 24:04.328
sometimes it's exciting for us to
see responsiveness externalized,

24:04.413 --> 24:07.203
like with a...
Like with a penis.

24:07.913 --> 24:10.162
Wouldn't you guys just rather
watch girls doing it, though?

24:10.246 --> 24:11.746
Well, you would think that.

24:11.830 --> 24:15.871
But usually in these movies,
they hire two straight women to pretend,

24:15.954 --> 24:17.328
and the inauthenticity
is just unbearable.

24:17.413 --> 24:18.995
Whoa, that's enough.

24:22.830 --> 24:25.245
Laser, your mom
and I sense

24:25.329 --> 24:27.412
that there's some
other stuff going on in your life.

24:27.496 --> 24:29.537
We just want
to be let in.

24:29.621 --> 24:31.078
What do you mean?

24:31.163 --> 24:34.203
Are you having a relationship
with someone?

24:34.288 --> 24:38.203
You can tell us, honey.
We would understand and support you.

24:39.121 --> 24:41.328
Look, I only met him once.

24:42.288 --> 24:43.662
What do you mean once?

24:43.747 --> 24:44.995
Did he find you online?
Wait.

24:45.121 --> 24:46.412
What?
Wait, wait, who did you meet once?

24:46.496 --> 24:47.579
Paul. I met him with Joni.

24:47.663 --> 24:48.662
Paul? Who's Paul?

24:48.747 --> 24:50.620
Why was Joni there?
She set it up.

24:50.705 --> 24:52.995
Wait, forget the set-up.
Who's Paul?

24:53.079 --> 24:54.537
Our sperm donor.

25:01.413 --> 25:03.328
Did you guys think
I was gay?

25:04.037 --> 25:06.078
No.

25:06.163 --> 25:07.328
No way.

25:07.413 --> 25:09.078
Of course not.

25:09.163 --> 25:11.412
Yeah, I mean, we understand
that you'd be curious

25:11.496 --> 25:13.078
about your biological father.

25:13.163 --> 25:15.412
I mean,
it's completely natural.

25:15.496 --> 25:17.370
But why didn't you tell us?

25:17.455 --> 25:18.662
Because we knew
you'd be upset.

25:18.747 --> 25:20.537
We're not upset!
No, no, no.

25:20.621 --> 25:23.746
We're not. We wish that
you'd included us in the conversation.

25:23.954 --> 25:24.953
That's all.

25:25.079 --> 25:28.870
You know? But...
But you met him, and that's cool.

25:28.954 --> 25:30.995
And now,
we can move on.

25:33.455 --> 25:34.911
Actually,
I want to see him again.

25:34.996 --> 25:37.412
You do?

25:37.496 --> 25:38.870
Yeah, I was
gonna tell you.

25:38.954 --> 25:41.787
Well, no. Okay?
No way.

25:41.871 --> 25:44.662
No one's seeing anyone
until we meet him.

25:48.830 --> 25:53.370
I get it, okay? He's their biological
father and all that crap.

25:53.455 --> 25:56.911
But it still feels
really shitty.

25:56.996 --> 25:59.911
Like we're not enough
or something, you know?

25:59.996 --> 26:02.537
Of course I know.
You know, I don't...

26:02.621 --> 26:05.787
I don't want to time-share
our kids with anybody.

26:05.871 --> 26:09.911
Especially when it's Joni's last summer
at home.

26:09.996 --> 26:11.203
No way.

26:15.496 --> 26:17.662
Jesus, Jules!

26:17.747 --> 26:21.412
The plumber was just here.
God, it's gross.

26:22.288 --> 26:26.078
Look, we have to be
smart about this.

26:26.163 --> 26:30.620
You know, if we act like grubby bitches,
we're just gonna make it worse.

26:30.705 --> 26:32.412
I know.

26:32.496 --> 26:36.412
Let's just kill him
with kindness and put it to bed.

26:36.496 --> 26:38.245
I'm with you, honey.

26:39.538 --> 26:42.036
We're gonna get
through this, okay?

26:43.747 --> 26:45.495
I love you, chicken.

26:45.580 --> 26:47.412
I love you, too, pony.

27:25.121 --> 27:27.911
Paul. It's so great
to meet you. H i. Yeah.

27:27.996 --> 27:30.412
Great to meet you, too.

27:30.496 --> 27:31.662
Hey. Jules.
Hello, Jules.

27:31.746 --> 27:33.412
I'm Nic.
Hi, Nic.

27:33.496 --> 27:34.495
Hi.

27:34.580 --> 27:36.245
I hope the traffic
wasn't too bad.

27:36.329 --> 27:38.911
No, I took my motorcycle,
so I pretty much just weave through it.

27:38.996 --> 27:40.245
Oh, great.

27:40.329 --> 27:42.328
I brought you this.

27:42.413 --> 27:43.745
I don't know if
you folks drink wine.

27:43.829 --> 27:45.579
Oh, no, are you kidding?
We love it.

27:45.663 --> 27:48.412
Wow, a Petite Sirah.
What a treat!

27:48.496 --> 27:49.786
'86.

27:49.912 --> 27:51.953
Yeah. I'll get some glasses.
All right.

27:57.580 --> 28:00.036
Yeah. Wow.

28:00.163 --> 28:01.911
Beautiful house.
Yeah, thanks. Thanks.

28:01.996 --> 28:03.036
You guys been here
a long time?

28:03.121 --> 28:05.828
Yeah. You know,
about 10 years.

28:05.912 --> 28:07.911
God, has it been
that long? I mean...

28:09.163 --> 28:12.328
That's... Yeah.
You know them, yeah.

28:13.329 --> 28:14.870
Hey, Joni.
How you doing?

28:14.954 --> 28:16.703
Good, how are you?
Good.

28:16.787 --> 28:18.579
Hey, man.
Hey.

28:18.663 --> 28:20.036
What's up, man?

28:20.121 --> 28:21.579
You okay?

28:21.663 --> 28:24.328
Yeah. Yeah, great.

28:24.413 --> 28:26.870
Go easy on the wine, hon.
It's daytime.

28:26.954 --> 28:29.953
Okay. Same goes for the micromanaging.
Okay?

28:34.829 --> 28:38.412
So, Paul, did you
always know that...

28:38.496 --> 28:39.495
Yes.

28:39.580 --> 28:42.870
...that you wanted to be
in the food services industry?

28:43.746 --> 28:45.995
I always liked food.

28:46.079 --> 28:47.412
Oh, yeah.

28:47.496 --> 28:50.703
No, I was asking because I remember
when I was reading your file,

28:50.787 --> 28:53.328
back when we were
looking for,

28:53.413 --> 28:55.786
you know, sperm...

28:55.912 --> 28:57.328
Can I have the potato
salad, babe? Sure.

28:57.413 --> 29:01.203
Anyway, you said that you were studying
international relations.

29:01.288 --> 29:05.495
Oh, yeah. Wow, that was a...
That was a long time ago.

29:07.246 --> 29:10.870
Yeah, I was considering it,
but then I dropped out of school.

29:14.288 --> 29:16.245
You dropped
out of college?

29:16.329 --> 29:18.036
Yeah, it just
wasn't my thing.

29:18.121 --> 29:19.953
No? Why's that?
I don't know.

29:20.037 --> 29:23.454
It just seemed like a massive waste
of money after a while, you know?

29:23.538 --> 29:26.328
I was just sitting
on my ass listening to people spout ideas.

29:26.413 --> 29:28.911
I could just as easily
have learned in a book.

29:31.204 --> 29:32.370
Oh.

29:33.329 --> 29:34.412
Okay.

29:34.496 --> 29:36.620
I'm not saying that,
you know,

29:36.704 --> 29:39.454
I think that higher learning
uniformly blows.

29:39.538 --> 29:41.911
You know, I think
college is great for some people.

29:41.996 --> 29:43.579
Joni, I'm sure
you're gonna love it.

29:43.662 --> 29:46.579
But just... I'm a doer.
That's how I learn.

29:46.662 --> 29:50.537
It's just me.
I'm weird that way, I guess. Thank you.

29:50.620 --> 29:53.328
Which is probably why
I'm in the food services industry.

29:54.496 --> 29:55.579
Right.

29:55.662 --> 29:57.745
Hey, Mom,
you see what he did there, right?

29:57.829 --> 29:58.786
You said "food
services industry,"

29:58.871 --> 30:01.120
so then he said
"food services industry."

30:01.204 --> 30:02.995
Yeah. I got that,
Laser. Thanks.

30:04.413 --> 30:07.911
So, Paul,
what about your...

30:07.996 --> 30:10.454
What about
your social life?

30:10.538 --> 30:12.454
My social life?

30:12.538 --> 30:15.078
Yeah, you know,
are you married, divorced, seeing anyone?

30:15.163 --> 30:16.579
Mom.
What?

30:16.662 --> 30:18.828
We're getting
to know Paul. It's okay.

30:19.329 --> 30:24.661
No, no, it's okay. I...
No, I've never been married nor divorced.

30:24.746 --> 30:25.786
I date sometimes,

30:25.871 --> 30:29.870
but I'm really just
kind of focused on my restaurant right now.

30:33.496 --> 30:36.911
Well, that's...
Yeah. Makes sense.

30:36.996 --> 30:38.412
So, cheers.

30:38.496 --> 30:39.953
Yeah. Cheers.

30:40.037 --> 30:41.370
Excellent wine,
by the way.

30:41.455 --> 30:42.495
Thank you.

30:44.496 --> 30:45.995
How old are you again?

30:46.079 --> 30:49.078
You must be the
griller of the family.

30:49.163 --> 30:50.495
Yeah.

30:55.746 --> 30:56.745
No, that's okay.

30:56.829 --> 30:57.870
I like
to be positive.

30:57.954 --> 30:58.995
Yeah.

30:59.079 --> 31:00.203
So how'd you two meet?

31:01.455 --> 31:02.661
We met at UCLA.

31:02.746 --> 31:04.412
I was a resident,

31:06.496 --> 31:08.454
and Jules had
an emergency.

31:08.537 --> 31:09.536
My tongue was numb.

31:10.704 --> 31:13.078
Really? Your tongue?
Laser.

31:13.163 --> 31:14.536
Oh, my God.

31:14.620 --> 31:16.078
It's not nice.

31:16.163 --> 31:19.370
No, that's not nice. I mean, we've heard
that story 100, 000 times.

31:19.455 --> 31:21.078
What happened to your tongue?
I don't know.

31:21.163 --> 31:25.412
I mean, I lost all the feeling in my face
and my tongue.

31:25.496 --> 31:29.078
And then, you know, I got really nervous
'cause I thought that I was gonna gag

31:29.163 --> 31:30.745
and, you know,
maybe like...

31:30.829 --> 31:32.245
Choke? Die?

31:32.329 --> 31:33.578
Yeah, exactly.

31:33.662 --> 31:34.661
What'd you do to help her?

31:34.746 --> 31:35.786
I gave her a Valium,

31:35.871 --> 31:39.162
and I told her to relax
and tried to get her to talk,

31:39.288 --> 31:41.328
you know, move her tongue around.
Yeah.

31:41.413 --> 31:43.578
Actually, she started teasing me,
and that really helped.

31:43.662 --> 31:45.203
I was trying
to distract you.

31:45.288 --> 31:48.494
I know. It worked.
You were really funny.

31:48.579 --> 31:50.745
You were really pretty.

31:51.829 --> 31:54.078
And then, you know,
my tongue started working again.

31:55.413 --> 31:57.578
Sure.
God, Mom, please.

32:01.912 --> 32:03.578
Yeah.

32:03.662 --> 32:05.078
Wow, we've been glued
at the hip ever since.

32:05.163 --> 32:06.661
Yeah.
No doubt.

32:07.662 --> 32:09.745
Yeah. Great. Great story.

32:09.829 --> 32:11.703
Yeah, we like it.

32:12.746 --> 32:15.287
So, Nic, you, you're a doctor,
I know that.

32:15.371 --> 32:16.828
But what are
you into, Jules?

32:16.912 --> 32:18.203
What do you do?

32:19.371 --> 32:23.578
Well, you know, I mean, I studied
architecture in college.

32:23.662 --> 32:24.661
Right.

32:24.746 --> 32:26.203
But I'm not
really an architect.

32:26.288 --> 32:27.911
I mean, I was on my way
to becoming one,

32:27.996 --> 32:30.412
but I quit before
the kids were born.

32:30.495 --> 32:31.619
That happens.

32:31.704 --> 32:32.995
And then when they got
a little bit older,

32:33.079 --> 32:35.578
I started a Balinese furniture
import business.

32:35.662 --> 32:37.078
Right on.

32:37.163 --> 32:39.412
But that didn't
really work out.

32:39.495 --> 32:40.494
Yeah,
businesses aren't easy.

32:40.579 --> 32:41.619
Yeah.

32:41.704 --> 32:44.745
But I'm in the process
of starting a new business.

32:44.829 --> 32:46.412
Great, good for you.
What's that?

32:46.495 --> 32:48.745
Landscape design.
I mean, you know, not gardening.

32:48.829 --> 32:50.995
I mean, you know,
there's a gardening component,

32:51.079 --> 32:56.745
but, really, the real work
is in creating unique,

32:56.829 --> 32:59.578
eco-friendly spaces
that, you know, the surrounding,

32:59.662 --> 33:03.036
that blend, you know,
with the surrounding environment.

33:03.121 --> 33:04.203
You know what I mean?

33:04.288 --> 33:06.703
Definitely.

33:06.787 --> 33:08.745
Most definitely.
Yeah.

33:11.829 --> 33:14.578
Hey, Joni, did you
tell Paul about your graduation speech?

33:14.662 --> 33:16.078
No, she didn't tell me.

33:16.163 --> 33:18.536
It was so full of
wisdom and hope.

33:18.620 --> 33:19.745
Yeah.

33:19.829 --> 33:21.953
Hey, go get it.

33:23.204 --> 33:25.245
You know, I bet Paul
would like to hear it.

33:25.329 --> 33:26.745
No, Mom,
I'm sure he wouldn't.

33:26.829 --> 33:28.203
No, no, no,
sure he would.

33:28.288 --> 33:29.453
Go on, go get it.

33:29.537 --> 33:31.120
No, I don't want to.

33:31.204 --> 33:33.078
Sweetie,
don't be embarrassed.

33:33.163 --> 33:38.411
Mom, I'm not embarrassed.
Jesus, give it a rest. J ust let it go.

33:40.704 --> 33:41.870
I'm gonna get
some ice cream.

33:41.954 --> 33:43.203
I'll help.
Okay.

33:47.037 --> 33:48.911
Honey, it's your
fourth glass.

33:48.996 --> 33:53.162
Actually, it's my third.
But, you know, thanks for counting.

33:54.495 --> 33:56.578
Hey, I was...
You know, I was thinking.

33:56.662 --> 33:59.203
I just bought this place
last year, and it's...

34:00.037 --> 34:01.328
I mean,
the backyard's a wreck.

34:01.412 --> 34:05.453
Would you be interested in maybe
coming and doing some work for me?

34:05.537 --> 34:06.786
That's okay.

34:06.871 --> 34:08.328
No, seriously.
I can't...

34:08.411 --> 34:10.745
I don't have time
to do it myself and...

34:10.829 --> 34:12.536
Well, I mean,
that's really sweet of you,

34:12.620 --> 34:13.911
but you should think
about it, you know.

34:13.996 --> 34:15.745
No, why?
I just did.

34:15.829 --> 34:20.245
I mean, it's all right
if you're not up for it. It's okay.

34:20.329 --> 34:24.494
No, I am.
I'm up for it. Yeah.

34:25.329 --> 34:27.078
Yeah? Yeah?
Hey...

34:27.163 --> 34:28.245
All right.

34:28.329 --> 34:29.745
Okay.

34:29.829 --> 34:31.327
Great.

34:31.411 --> 34:33.286
Excellent.

34:33.411 --> 34:34.995
Right on.
Yeah.

34:36.829 --> 34:41.203
I'm just saying,
the plan was to limit his involvement.

34:41.288 --> 34:43.745
You're unbelievable. I mean, you're
all about me getting clients.

34:43.829 --> 34:45.661
And then I get a client,
and you're like, "Oh, no, not him."

34:45.746 --> 34:47.745
Yeah. But he's not
just a client, Jules.

34:47.829 --> 34:49.203
He's our sperm donor.

34:49.288 --> 34:52.661
I mean, haven't you heard the expression
"don't shit where you eat"?

34:52.746 --> 34:55.411
Yes, and I think
it's disgusting.

34:58.871 --> 35:03.327
Okay, I'm sorry. Look, he just seemed
so self-satisfied to me.

35:04.288 --> 35:06.411
You know?

35:06.495 --> 35:09.411
Yeah, he was working
the "alternative" thing pretty hard.

35:09.495 --> 35:11.745
Oh, my God.
When he said that thing about,

35:11.829 --> 35:16.078
"Oh, I just need to get outside and do
things, not sit on my ass and learn.

35:16.163 --> 35:19.411
"But that's just me, you know.
I'm weird that way."

35:31.579 --> 35:35.494
I'd certainly clean up a lot of this grass.
It's pretty... It's wasted.

35:35.579 --> 35:36.745
Sure.

35:36.829 --> 35:39.453
The lavender
is so nice.

35:39.537 --> 35:43.411
And with the sun that
you have, that and, like, that rosemary,

35:43.495 --> 35:45.828
which kind of grow everywhere,
and you wouldn't even have

35:45.912 --> 35:46.911
to think about it.
Yeah.

35:46.996 --> 35:52.619
You could go like a whole,
like, Secret Garden, kind of a trellis-y,

35:52.704 --> 35:55.244
like hidden kind of thing.

35:55.328 --> 36:00.369
Or you could, you know,
you could go like Asian-y.

36:00.454 --> 36:04.286
Minimal. You know, like rocks
and kind of all clean and...

36:06.579 --> 36:07.661
Whatever you think.

36:07.746 --> 36:09.327
Well,
what do you think?

36:09.412 --> 36:13.162
You know what? I'm not...
I'm not feeling minimal.

36:13.245 --> 36:15.870
I really... I'm really
liking more is more.

36:15.954 --> 36:19.078
You know? I mean,
let's not try to tame this space, okay?

36:19.163 --> 36:20.870
Let's just let it be
like lush,

36:20.954 --> 36:24.870
overgrown, fecund.

36:26.787 --> 36:28.120
Fecund.

36:30.370 --> 36:32.327
Like fertile, yeah?

36:32.412 --> 36:35.661
No, I love that word. You just, you don't
hear people use it very often.

36:35.746 --> 36:37.411
No, yeah.

36:38.163 --> 36:40.911
Yeah, more is more.
Yeah, I like that.

36:40.996 --> 36:42.995
Right on.
Let's do that.

36:46.620 --> 36:48.327
I'm sorry.
What?

36:50.912 --> 36:53.745
I just keep seeing
my kids' expressions in your face.

36:53.829 --> 36:54.870
Really?
Yeah.

36:54.954 --> 36:58.536
Like that. Like, "Really?"
Like, yeah. That's like Laser.

37:02.620 --> 37:03.703
Hmm.

37:03.787 --> 37:04.995
Well...

37:11.829 --> 37:14.120
Do you like patios?

37:14.203 --> 37:15.578
Yeah, patios are good. Okay.

37:15.662 --> 37:16.911
Yeah.

37:16.996 --> 37:18.828
We could put a patio up there.
Where?

37:18.912 --> 37:20.327
Let's take a look.

37:21.245 --> 37:25.244
Hello. Donor Dad?
Stone cold fox.

37:25.328 --> 37:27.745
Must you take everything beautiful
and make it dirty?

37:27.829 --> 37:29.745
Okay.

37:29.829 --> 37:33.369
I'm just saying.
Spermster's a hottie.

37:33.454 --> 37:35.036
Is he single?

37:35.121 --> 37:38.078
Okay.
First of all, ew,

37:38.162 --> 37:40.161
and second,
he's a really good person.

37:40.245 --> 37:44.369
So I'd prefer it if you didn't taint him
with your whore juice.

37:44.454 --> 37:48.202
Fair enough, hairy muff.
I'm out of here.

37:48.287 --> 37:51.244
You lovebirds can
split my letters.

37:58.120 --> 37:59.161
Do you want
to keep playing?

37:59.245 --> 38:00.536
Sure.

38:00.620 --> 38:01.870
Okay.

38:08.328 --> 38:11.036
Sometimes I feel sorry
for Sasha, you know?

38:11.120 --> 38:12.327
Yeah.

38:16.079 --> 38:20.619
It's like she has to sexualize
every experience, you know?

38:20.704 --> 38:22.119
It's just sad.

38:22.203 --> 38:24.661
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
That's sad.

38:33.328 --> 38:34.703
Oh, come on.

38:34.787 --> 38:36.703
Hi ya, what's the score?

38:36.787 --> 38:38.078
Pretty close.

38:38.162 --> 38:39.745
Yeah?
20 to three. Match point.

38:40.704 --> 38:42.536
So how'd it go today?

38:42.620 --> 38:45.661
It was good.
We settled on a concept.

38:46.287 --> 38:47.995
Ah. What is it?

38:48.078 --> 38:49.953
Well, you know,
it's kind of...

38:50.037 --> 38:52.578
It's kind of hard to explain.

38:52.662 --> 38:55.077
You really have
to see the space.

38:57.412 --> 39:01.036
Okay. Hey, Laser, did you write the
get-well card for Pup-pup?

39:03.078 --> 39:04.828
Laser, come on.

39:04.912 --> 39:08.411
What do I have to do? I bought
you the card. I put it on your desk.

39:09.328 --> 39:10.578
All you have
to do is sign it.

39:10.662 --> 39:12.202
Mom, just settle down,
okay? I'll do it.

39:12.287 --> 39:15.494
Hey. You don't tell me
to settle, mister.

39:17.662 --> 39:19.494
If it's not in the mail
by tomorrow morning,

39:19.579 --> 39:21.870
we're not going to the Dodger game
Saturday, okay?

39:21.954 --> 39:24.453
Whatever. I have
other plans anyways.

39:24.537 --> 39:25.828
What other plans?

39:28.162 --> 39:29.661
I asked you a question.

39:30.370 --> 39:33.494
I said I'd do something
with Paul, okay? God!

39:38.579 --> 39:39.661
Shit!

39:44.162 --> 39:45.578
I believe this might not
be such a good idea.

39:45.662 --> 39:46.786
Are you filming?
Yeah.

39:46.871 --> 39:49.619
He's not gonna make that.
You're not gonna make that, Clay. No way.

39:49.704 --> 39:51.202
Let's do something
different.

39:51.287 --> 39:54.077
Will you quit being
such a choch and run the camera?

39:54.162 --> 39:56.411
I'm only doing this once,
so keep my shit in frame.

40:00.662 --> 40:02.077
All right.

40:06.871 --> 40:08.661
All right, I got it.

40:14.620 --> 40:15.703
Shit! Dude!

40:17.162 --> 40:18.202
Clay, are you all right?
Fuck!

40:18.287 --> 40:20.286
Did you get it, dude?
Clay, you all right, bro?

40:20.370 --> 40:21.994
Seriously, are you okay?
I'm fucking fine! Fuck!

40:22.078 --> 40:24.494
Did you fucking
get it? God!

40:24.579 --> 40:26.828
Yeah, I got it.

40:26.912 --> 40:29.161
Fuck, dude.
Clay...

40:29.245 --> 40:31.161
That was fucking crazy.

40:32.370 --> 40:34.035
Where's your place,
Clay, up here?

40:34.120 --> 40:37.286
Yeah, right here
on the right.

40:37.370 --> 40:39.202
This is good.
Cool here?

40:39.287 --> 40:40.870
Yeah.

40:40.954 --> 40:43.119
You take care.
Later.

40:43.203 --> 40:44.536
See you.

40:48.829 --> 40:51.745
Let's wait till
he gets to the house.

40:53.620 --> 40:56.661
Maybe we could hang out together just
you and me next time.

40:57.662 --> 41:01.244
Clay's cool. He just...
You know, he gets a little amped sometimes.

41:01.328 --> 41:05.161
That's not amped, man.
That's being a tool.

41:05.245 --> 41:07.202
No, he's not a tool, okay?
That's just his way.

41:07.287 --> 41:09.745
Yeah, I don't like the way
he was talking to you at all.

41:09.829 --> 41:11.578
Well, you know what?
You don't know him very well, do you?

41:11.662 --> 41:14.369
I mean, you hung out
with him once.

41:14.454 --> 41:16.745
You're right.
I don't know him.

41:19.704 --> 41:22.119
Can I ask you something?

41:22.203 --> 41:23.453
Sure.

41:25.287 --> 41:27.286
Why'd you donate sperm?

41:31.495 --> 41:35.161
It just seemed like a lot more fun than
donating blood.

41:39.412 --> 41:44.077
No, I loved the idea
of helping people.

41:44.162 --> 41:48.910
People who were in need, you know,
wanted to have kids and couldn't.

41:48.995 --> 41:51.411
So then you did it
to help people?

41:53.412 --> 41:55.327
It was a long time ago.

41:57.454 --> 41:59.119
How much did you
get paid?

41:59.203 --> 42:01.411
Why do you want
to know that?

42:01.495 --> 42:03.119
I'm just curious.

42:05.829 --> 42:09.119
I got paid 60 bucks a pop.

42:10.662 --> 42:11.745
That's it?

42:12.454 --> 42:15.161
Well, it was, like,
a lot of money to me at the time.

42:15.245 --> 42:19.494
And with inflation,
it's like $90 today.

42:19.579 --> 42:20.661
Hey.

42:22.370 --> 42:24.411
I'm glad I did it.

42:36.787 --> 42:37.994
Whoa.

42:38.870 --> 42:39.869
What's this?

42:39.953 --> 42:41.327
H i. Come here.

42:42.953 --> 42:44.703
Come here. Sit down.

42:49.828 --> 42:55.035
I'm sorry that
I've been so edgy lately, you know.

42:55.120 --> 42:57.619
I know I haven't
been my highest self.

42:57.704 --> 42:58.869
Yeah.

42:58.953 --> 43:02.703
And you've been
really patient with me.

43:02.787 --> 43:07.286
And I just want you to know that that
hasn't gone unrecognized, okay?

43:20.078 --> 43:22.910
How's the water?

43:22.995 --> 43:25.994
It's perfect.
You wanna come in?

43:26.911 --> 43:29.661
In a minute.
You enjoy it first.

43:35.287 --> 43:37.077
I forgot
the lavender bath salts.

43:37.162 --> 43:38.869
Oh, I don't care.
No, no, no.

43:38.953 --> 43:40.785
I wanna get them.
I got them special.

43:40.870 --> 43:42.745
Don't go. Don't.

43:43.579 --> 43:45.869
Don't move.
I'll be right back.

44:04.995 --> 44:06.869
Nic?

44:09.953 --> 44:11.202
Hey, Nic?

44:13.078 --> 44:14.327
Jesus!

44:16.745 --> 44:17.994
U h-huh.

44:19.078 --> 44:21.785
Right. No,
I understand.

44:21.870 --> 44:26.536
I understand where the pain is, but
it doesn't sound like a contraction.

44:26.620 --> 44:29.202
It sounds more like gas.
I'm sorry.

44:29.287 --> 44:30.494
Fuck!

44:32.245 --> 44:33.411
Right. Okay.

44:33.495 --> 44:36.703
All right, this is our plan.
I don't think you should worry,

44:36.786 --> 44:39.910
and I think you should
just call me back if it continues.

44:47.412 --> 44:48.744
You sure you don't
want any coffee?

44:48.828 --> 44:49.994
No thanks.

44:50.078 --> 44:51.453
It's good.

44:51.537 --> 44:52.744
I'm all right.

44:52.828 --> 44:56.536
But I think I'm gonna go
to the nursery tomorrow,

44:56.620 --> 44:59.661
so I want you to sign off on
this Bougainvillea.

44:59.745 --> 45:00.994
Sure.

45:01.620 --> 45:02.661
What is this?
Did you make it?

45:02.745 --> 45:05.327
Yeah. That's some pie I made.
It's right from my garden.

45:05.412 --> 45:07.202
It's strawberry-rhubarb.

45:07.287 --> 45:08.869
Here. Try.

45:08.953 --> 45:11.578
Yeah, okay.
Twist my arm.

45:16.162 --> 45:17.869
Oh, my God.
It's good, huh?

45:17.953 --> 45:19.077
That's criminal.
Have some more.

45:19.162 --> 45:20.494
No. No, please,
just take it away.

45:20.579 --> 45:21.578
Come on.

45:21.662 --> 45:23.578
You had one bite.
No, if I have one more,

45:23.662 --> 45:26.744
you're gonna have to tape it to my ass
'cause that's where it's gonna end up.

45:26.828 --> 45:30.077
Hey now, don't go negative on your ass.
No reason for that.

45:35.454 --> 45:37.035
You're good with
the plants, then?

45:45.911 --> 45:48.327
'Cause, you know,
I can change it.

45:48.412 --> 45:50.411
If you're not happy with it,
we can do something else.

45:50.537 --> 45:52.411
No. No, no. I'm... We can get whatever
you want, you know?

45:52.495 --> 45:54.161
I'm just thinking.

45:57.911 --> 46:01.077
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'm good with them.
They're great.

46:01.162 --> 46:02.244
Oh.

46:02.328 --> 46:03.827
They're great.

46:06.287 --> 46:10.202
Sorry. Sometimes I mistake
silence for criticism.

46:10.911 --> 46:12.244
I wasn't criticizing you.

46:12.328 --> 46:14.161
No, no, I just, you know...

46:15.703 --> 46:20.744
Sometimes Nic can be a little critical
'cause she's a perfectionist.

46:20.828 --> 46:22.952
Well, I don't see why
you'd take it that way.

46:23.036 --> 46:25.536
I think you're
really talented.

46:27.036 --> 46:28.453
Really?

46:28.537 --> 46:29.744
Really.

46:33.828 --> 46:35.119
Excuse me, señora?

46:35.203 --> 46:36.244
Yeah?

46:36.328 --> 46:37.869
5:00.

46:37.953 --> 46:39.077
Okay, thanks.

46:40.370 --> 46:41.869
Same time tomorrow?

46:41.953 --> 46:43.869
Yeah. Same time tomorrow.

46:44.953 --> 46:46.202
Good night.

46:46.287 --> 46:48.994
Thank you. Okay,
good night. Thank you.

46:49.078 --> 46:50.119
Whew!

46:50.203 --> 46:51.952
I should get going, too.

46:53.036 --> 46:55.202
Same time tomorrow?

46:55.287 --> 46:57.077
That's mean.
Take this.

46:57.162 --> 46:58.494
No. U h-uh.
I don't want it.

46:58.579 --> 46:59.577
Take it.
No.

46:59.661 --> 47:01.453
For the kids.
No. I don't want it.

47:01.537 --> 47:02.702
Come on.

47:02.786 --> 47:04.369
No. God,
you are such a pusher.

47:16.328 --> 47:17.327
Oh!

47:17.412 --> 47:18.744
Wow. Okay.

47:21.995 --> 47:26.202
I don't know where that came from.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I...

47:26.287 --> 47:27.744
Jules.

47:27.828 --> 47:29.577
I'm gonna just go and...

47:29.661 --> 47:30.869
It's okay.

47:30.953 --> 47:32.077
No, I just...

47:32.162 --> 47:34.369
It's okay.
It was okay.

47:36.619 --> 47:38.327
But I shall return!

47:48.536 --> 47:49.952
What?

47:54.495 --> 47:55.827
So how'd it go
with Paul today?

47:55.911 --> 47:57.327
What do you mean?

47:57.412 --> 48:02.202
Well, did you break ground? Did you
dig in? I don't know the terms.

48:02.287 --> 48:05.327
We just talked,
conceptually.

48:05.412 --> 48:06.660
Oh, wow.

48:07.911 --> 48:11.411
So it was less of a
"doing" day? Was he okay with that?

48:13.287 --> 48:16.910
You know, I think
we should lay off the Paul digs a little.

48:18.412 --> 48:19.785
Oh, okay.

48:26.661 --> 48:29.535
And I also think
we should start composting.

48:34.370 --> 48:37.244
Hey, take this.

48:37.328 --> 48:38.411
Thanks.

48:38.494 --> 48:40.369
You got that fair skin.

48:42.078 --> 48:44.827
You don't have
my peasant blood.

48:49.203 --> 48:50.577
Ignore.

48:50.661 --> 48:51.952
Who's that?

48:52.036 --> 48:55.453
My mom, N ic.
She's driving me crazy.

48:55.536 --> 48:57.660
Yeah? What's she doing?

48:57.745 --> 48:59.952
She's treating me
like I'm 12.

49:00.036 --> 49:01.910
It's like she doesn't want to admit
that I'm an adult.

49:01.995 --> 49:04.869
Well, that's your mom.
That's her job.

49:04.953 --> 49:08.119
What? To smother me to death?
That's not her job.

49:09.162 --> 49:12.244
If you want things
to be different, you got to do that,

49:12.328 --> 49:14.493
make that happen yourself.

49:14.578 --> 49:16.161
That's your job.

49:17.328 --> 49:18.286
Yeah.

49:18.370 --> 49:19.452
Do you like peppers?

49:19.536 --> 49:20.577
Yeah.

49:21.911 --> 49:23.119
Thanks.

49:25.953 --> 49:28.411
There's no way,
dude. You missed it by, like, 20 feet.

49:28.494 --> 49:30.286
Well, if Paul wasn't there,
I could have made it.

49:30.370 --> 49:32.077
That guy creeps me out.

49:32.162 --> 49:34.910
He's kind of a fag, dude,
trying to act like your dad and shit.

49:34.995 --> 49:36.785
Whatever, all right?

49:40.162 --> 49:42.493
Hey, buddy. Hey.

49:43.245 --> 49:45.119
I've seen this dog around here before.
I think he's lost.

49:45.203 --> 49:47.161
Let's pee on his head.

49:48.162 --> 49:49.618
What? No.

49:49.703 --> 49:50.869
Where you going?

49:50.953 --> 49:52.077
Dude, what are you doing?

49:52.162 --> 49:53.410
Dude, just hold him.

49:53.494 --> 49:54.618
Dude, quit it.

49:55.370 --> 49:56.702
"Dude, quit it."

49:57.411 --> 49:59.910
Go on, get out of here! Go!

50:00.661 --> 50:02.119
Why are you such a fag?

50:03.619 --> 50:05.744
Why are you such
a fucking dick?

50:19.619 --> 50:21.535
That hat looks
good on you. Thanks.

50:21.619 --> 50:23.493
Keep it.
Thank you.

50:24.494 --> 50:25.493
Never been on a bike?

50:25.578 --> 50:26.577
Mmm-mmm.

50:27.661 --> 50:28.744
Never.

50:28.828 --> 50:30.286
You got to wear
one of these.

50:36.245 --> 50:37.244
Okay.

50:37.328 --> 50:38.994
You've got to hold on
tight right there.

50:43.619 --> 50:45.410
Here we go. You ready?

50:45.494 --> 50:46.618
I'm ready.
You sure?

50:46.703 --> 50:48.202
Yeah.

51:28.120 --> 51:31.244
Hey, babe, relax.
She'll be back when she gets back.

51:31.327 --> 51:33.660
Quit telling me
to relax. Okay?

51:41.619 --> 51:42.660
What the fuck?

51:53.078 --> 51:56.577
Wow. Funny how someone
conveniently forgot to tell me

51:56.661 --> 51:59.660
that they were driving home
on a motorcycle.

52:01.494 --> 52:04.410
Do you know how many people I've
seen come into the hospital paralyzed

52:04.494 --> 52:05.910
from motorcycle accidents?

52:05.995 --> 52:07.744
I'm a very safe driver, N ic.

52:07.828 --> 52:11.660
Yeah, that is so not the point that
I'm making, Paul.

52:11.745 --> 52:13.994
Joni knows that this is something
I'd just never allow.

52:14.078 --> 52:15.244
Mom, I'm 18 years old.

52:15.327 --> 52:16.368
Yeah?

52:16.453 --> 52:18.202
I won't even be living
here in, like, a month.

52:18.327 --> 52:19.910
Yeah, well, you're living here now.
Yeah?

52:19.995 --> 52:22.952
Well, why don't you get a jump on it and
pretend like I'm not?

52:29.203 --> 52:32.077
She's never talked
to me like that before.

52:32.162 --> 52:34.952
You know, if you backed off a little bit
on the restrictions,

52:35.036 --> 52:37.827
you probably wouldn't
have so much conflict.

52:37.911 --> 52:41.744
Oh, really? You think so, Paul?
Is that how it works?

52:41.828 --> 52:42.869
What's going on?

52:42.953 --> 52:44.577
Oh, nothing. Nothing.

52:44.661 --> 52:47.744
Paul's just giving me some
child-rearing lessons.

52:47.828 --> 52:48.827
I'm just saying...

52:48.911 --> 52:52.744
Listen, when you've been a parent for
18 years, you come and talk to me, okay?

52:52.828 --> 52:54.410
I'm just making
an observation.

52:54.494 --> 52:58.660
Yeah? Well, I need your observations
like I need a dick in my ass!

53:23.494 --> 53:24.577
Joni?

53:29.286 --> 53:32.493
Honey. Look,
I was upset, okay?

53:32.578 --> 53:34.702
You know how I feel
about motorcycles.

53:34.786 --> 53:37.077
Yeah, I know how
you feel about them.

53:37.162 --> 53:40.535
But I'm an adult now,
and you have to respect that, okay?

53:40.619 --> 53:41.994
Good night.

54:02.411 --> 54:03.410
Good? Good?

54:03.494 --> 54:04.618
Yeah, that's perfect.
Thanks.

54:23.494 --> 54:24.869
Hey, Paul.

54:26.578 --> 54:28.660
Hey, Jules.
What's up?

54:28.745 --> 54:33.577
It's all right. I just wanted to say
I'm sorry about last night.

54:33.661 --> 54:35.201
Hey...
I was really embarrassed.

54:35.286 --> 54:39.077
Hey, it wasn't you.
It was her who wigged out.

54:39.161 --> 54:41.452
I think she's, you know,
she's just having a really hard time.

54:41.536 --> 54:43.577
You know?

54:43.661 --> 54:46.118
Yeah. You really don't
have to defend her. Seriously.

54:46.202 --> 54:49.243
And about that kiss, that's...
You know, I don't do that.

54:49.327 --> 54:50.702
I completely
sensed that, yeah.

54:50.786 --> 54:52.285
So...

54:52.369 --> 54:55.660
I just wanted
to clear the air.

54:55.745 --> 54:57.118
The air is cleared.

54:57.202 --> 54:58.744
No, it's clear.

55:08.494 --> 55:09.577
No, Paul, I can't!

55:09.661 --> 55:10.869
Why? You don't want to?

55:10.953 --> 55:12.285
No, I have a guy outside!

55:12.369 --> 55:13.744
Oh, yeah.
Right, the guy.

55:18.828 --> 55:20.076
Oh, God.

55:24.536 --> 55:26.410
Okay, wait. Wait.

55:38.161 --> 55:40.410
Well! Hello!

55:41.161 --> 55:42.577
Yeah! Yeah!

55:42.661 --> 55:44.493
Okay, not so hard.
Not so hard. Okay.

55:46.286 --> 55:47.326
What?

55:47.411 --> 55:48.827
Oh, my God!
Yeah?

55:50.327 --> 55:51.660
Come on.

55:52.536 --> 55:53.869
Excuse me?

55:54.745 --> 55:56.785
You gotta be
fucking kidding me!

55:56.870 --> 55:58.076
Oh, God. Oh, God.

55:58.161 --> 55:59.410
Excuse me, señora?

55:59.494 --> 56:03.660
I can't fucking believe it.
Okay.

56:03.745 --> 56:07.076
You gotta go talk to him.
Are you gonna go talk to him?

56:07.161 --> 56:09.160
Okay. Fuck.
Oh, God.

56:11.035 --> 56:12.326
Shit.

56:13.536 --> 56:15.535
Excuse me, señora?
Okay!

56:18.327 --> 56:19.994
Hey, what's up?

56:21.578 --> 56:23.535
Where do you
want the stones?

56:23.619 --> 56:24.827
Stones?

56:26.703 --> 56:27.869
Over by the fence.

56:30.119 --> 56:31.201
What?

56:32.745 --> 56:34.744
I was using the bathroom.

56:36.244 --> 56:38.160
Do you need to use
the bathroom?

56:39.953 --> 56:42.076
Okay, then.
I'll be right back.

56:42.161 --> 56:43.952
Okay.
Take your time.

56:48.911 --> 56:50.034
That's H.

56:50.119 --> 56:51.535
Yeah, I know.

56:51.619 --> 56:52.702
All right. Lay-up.

56:52.786 --> 56:54.243
All right.

56:54.327 --> 56:57.827
Now you don't have
to go easy on me because you're winning.

56:59.327 --> 57:01.535
Nobody likes
a show-off, man.

57:03.327 --> 57:04.785
You gotta go
behind the back.

57:04.870 --> 57:05.952
God.

57:11.661 --> 57:13.827
Can I ask you a question?

57:15.411 --> 57:17.493
Would you rather
be buried or cremated?

57:18.911 --> 57:20.410
That's your question?

57:20.494 --> 57:22.326
I'd rather be cremated.

57:23.369 --> 57:25.368
I think I'd...

57:26.494 --> 57:28.410
I think I'd rather
be buried.

57:28.494 --> 57:30.160
But why? I mean,

57:30.244 --> 57:32.118
you're just gonna be
taking up more space in the earth.

57:32.202 --> 57:33.744
I don't know. The idea of being,
you know,

57:33.828 --> 57:38.410
torched into a chalky white substance
has got me a little freaked out.

57:38.494 --> 57:40.827
Why does it matter to you?
You're not even gonna be conscious.

57:40.911 --> 57:43.243
Okay, well, maybe,
I don't know,

57:43.327 --> 57:45.660
I want a place for people to come
and visit me one day.

57:45.745 --> 57:46.910
But why?
You're gonna be dead.

57:46.994 --> 57:48.785
You won't even
know they're there.

57:52.994 --> 57:54.702
Okay. Take it easy.

57:56.119 --> 57:57.577
Come on.

57:57.661 --> 58:00.535
So, what do you like better,
Nike or New Balance?

58:00.619 --> 58:02.702
Nike.
Oh, God, here we go.

58:05.745 --> 58:07.909
God, I love your
necklace! Can I see it?

58:07.994 --> 58:09.577
Sure.

58:09.661 --> 58:11.535
It's so beautiful.

58:11.619 --> 58:12.951
Thank you.

58:13.035 --> 58:14.201
Is it African?

58:14.286 --> 58:16.243
Yes, it's Ethiopian.

58:16.327 --> 58:17.368
Did you get it there?

58:17.453 --> 58:20.285
No, I got it at a flea market
in Brooklyn.

58:21.994 --> 58:23.118
Is that where you're from?

58:23.202 --> 58:24.909
No, I'm from here.

58:26.952 --> 58:28.618
Cool.
Hey, guys, how you doing?

58:28.703 --> 58:30.076
Good.
How's the food?

58:30.161 --> 58:31.160
It's great.

58:31.244 --> 58:32.410
Good? You're not
gonna eat your chicken?

58:32.494 --> 58:34.076
It's so yummy.
It's good?

58:34.161 --> 58:35.285
Yeah, it's really good.

58:35.369 --> 58:40.410
I'm sorry, but I have to take the lovely
Tanya away for a moment.

58:40.494 --> 58:42.909
All right. It was lovely
talking to you, ladies.

58:42.994 --> 58:44.827
You, too.
You, too.

58:49.786 --> 58:54.410
Okay, I'm sorry, but your donor daddy
is giving me the sex vibe.

58:54.494 --> 58:56.577
No, he's not.
He wouldn't do that.

58:56.661 --> 58:59.076
Why not?
He's not my dad.

58:59.161 --> 59:01.868
God, Sasha,
that's totally gross!

59:01.952 --> 59:05.076
Not everybody
wants to have sex with you, okay?

59:05.161 --> 59:08.201
Especially when
you act like a slut.

59:08.286 --> 59:09.368
Fuck you.

59:09.453 --> 59:12.744
Well, it makes you seem insecure
and desperate.

59:12.828 --> 59:15.076
I'm not insecure
and desperate.

59:15.161 --> 59:17.868
I'm just a normal,
sexual person.

59:17.952 --> 59:21.744
Maybe you'd understand that
if you weren't so uptight.

59:21.828 --> 59:24.702
Fuck you.
I'm not uptight.

59:29.077 --> 59:31.368
Oh, my God,
these heirloom tomatoes are amazing.

59:31.453 --> 59:32.993
Oh, yeah,
they're in season.

59:33.077 --> 59:35.201
You know, Joni brought some home from
Paul's garden the other day.

59:35.286 --> 59:36.785
They were huge.

59:36.869 --> 59:39.118
So the kids have
been spending time with him?

59:39.202 --> 59:43.493
Yeah. Yeah, they're spending all
kinds of quality time together.

59:43.578 --> 59:46.410
Well, you're lucky. You're lucky that
the kids bonded with the donor.

59:46.494 --> 59:48.326
I mean, you hear so
many nightmare stories.

59:48.411 --> 59:52.452
No, no, it's great.
They all just get along famously.

59:52.536 --> 59:54.326
Apparently, Paul
can do no wrong.

59:54.411 --> 59:58.201
Excuse me. Could we get
another bottle of the Seavey Cabernet?

59:58.327 --> 59:59.826
Thank you. I'm okay. I'm okay.
I don't need any more.

59:59.910 --> 01:00:02.618
Yeah, you're alone
on this one, Nicole.

01:00:03.827 --> 01:00:07.868
Hey, so have you guys gotten into the
whole acai smoothie craze?

01:00:07.952 --> 01:00:09.118
Acai fruit packs.

01:00:09.202 --> 01:00:13.076
Yeah. No, but they're pushing them like
crack at Whole Foods.

01:00:13.161 --> 01:00:15.826
Joel is so addicted to it.
He buys it by the case.

01:00:15.952 --> 01:00:17.243
Here's what I do.

01:00:17.327 --> 01:00:22.744
I throw one in the blender with bananas,
frozen strawberries and hemp milk.

01:00:22.827 --> 01:00:25.326
And I'll tell you what,
it is pretty sensational.

01:00:25.411 --> 01:00:27.326
J ust fucking kill me.
Okay?

01:00:27.411 --> 01:00:29.160
Honey.
I'm sorry, guys,

01:00:29.244 --> 01:00:34.368
but I just can't with the fucking hemp milk
and the organic farming.

01:00:34.453 --> 01:00:37.702
And, you know, if I hear one more person
say that they love heirloom tomatoes,

01:00:37.785 --> 01:00:39.744
I'm gonna fucking
kill myself. Okay?

01:00:39.827 --> 01:00:42.909
Oh. And do you know
that we're composting now?

01:00:42.994 --> 01:00:45.993
Oh, yeah.
"No, don't throw that in the trash.

01:00:46.077 --> 01:00:48.326
"You have to put it
in the composting bin

01:00:48.411 --> 01:00:53.909
"where all the beautiful little worms will
turn it into this organic mulch,

01:00:53.994 --> 01:00:56.993
"and then we'll all
feel good about ourselves. " You know?

01:00:57.077 --> 01:00:59.993
I can't do it, okay?
I can't fucking do it.

01:01:02.744 --> 01:01:05.826
Hey, babe. How about
some green tea?

01:01:06.494 --> 01:01:10.868
You know what, J ules?
I like my wine, okay? So fucking sue me.

01:01:10.952 --> 01:01:14.410
And FYI, red wine
has a chemical called resveratrol in it,

01:01:14.494 --> 01:01:17.743
which has been proven
to significantly extend human lifespan.

01:01:17.827 --> 01:01:21.452
If you drink, like,
a thousand glasses a day, yeah.

01:01:21.536 --> 01:01:23.201
Fuck you.

01:01:29.494 --> 01:01:31.076
I'm sorry.
It's okay.

01:01:31.161 --> 01:01:32.743
Go to her.

01:01:37.077 --> 01:01:38.201
Whoa.

01:01:38.286 --> 01:01:40.743
What the hell
is going on with them?

01:01:46.827 --> 01:01:49.368
Oh, my God.
What is going on with you?

01:01:49.453 --> 01:01:50.993
It's this whole Paul thing.

01:01:51.077 --> 01:01:53.493
It's just driving me
crazy, all right?

01:01:53.578 --> 01:01:55.452
I feel like he's taking over
my family.

01:01:55.536 --> 01:01:56.826
No. He's...

01:01:56.910 --> 01:01:58.160
Can I get you anything?

01:01:58.244 --> 01:02:00.660
No thanks, no.
He's not. He's not.

01:02:02.827 --> 01:02:03.909
Okay.

01:02:05.202 --> 01:02:07.326
Okay, I'm sorry,
all right?

01:02:09.327 --> 01:02:11.452
I guess I'm just exhausted.

01:02:12.994 --> 01:02:16.410
Yeah, maybe you just
need to take some time off, recharge.

01:02:16.494 --> 01:02:17.577
Right?

01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:19.410
Yeah, right.
Who's gonna pay for that?

01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:23.285
I mean, look,
I'm sorry,

01:02:23.369 --> 01:02:25.743
but, you know, I feel
like I'm carrying the whole load here.

01:02:25.827 --> 01:02:28.410
Yeah, 'cause that's
the way you like it.

01:02:28.494 --> 01:02:29.993
That's the way
you keep control.

01:02:30.827 --> 01:02:31.784
What are you
talking about?

01:02:31.869 --> 01:02:34.243
Come on,
you hated it when I worked.

01:02:34.327 --> 01:02:35.993
You wanted me at home
taking care of the kids.

01:02:36.077 --> 01:02:37.909
You wanted a wife.
That is just not true.

01:02:37.994 --> 01:02:39.535
No, you didn't like
any of the nannies,

01:02:39.619 --> 01:02:41.410
and you sure didn't
back my career.

01:02:41.494 --> 01:02:45.743
What are you talking about? I just
helped you start another business.

01:02:45.827 --> 01:02:48.826
Yeah, so you can feel
better about yourself.

01:02:50.161 --> 01:02:54.201
No, Jules.
So you can feel better about yourself.

01:02:56.161 --> 01:02:58.784
Are you even attracted
to me anymore?

01:03:00.369 --> 01:03:02.951
Would you
still like the wine?

01:03:03.035 --> 01:03:06.951
No, thank you. We'll just take the
check from inside, please.

01:03:07.035 --> 01:03:08.659
Okay, no problem.

01:03:11.286 --> 01:03:13.076
Oh, yeah. Pull my hair.

01:03:13.161 --> 01:03:14.951
Okay. Oh, yeah.

01:03:17.411 --> 01:03:18.493
Okay.

01:03:18.578 --> 01:03:19.577
Ow!

01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:35.410
I really want a cigarette.
I haven't smoked since Laser was born.

01:03:37.578 --> 01:03:38.909
Do you smoke?
Do you have a cigarette?

01:03:38.994 --> 01:03:40.452
Sometimes,
but I don't have any.

01:03:40.536 --> 01:03:42.160
I could go run out
and get you some.

01:03:42.244 --> 01:03:45.410
Yeah. Yeah, no, no.
No, don't go.

01:03:47.827 --> 01:03:48.909
God.

01:03:51.161 --> 01:03:53.076
Do you think

01:03:53.161 --> 01:03:56.493
I'm some sad-sack,
middle-aged lesbian?

01:03:57.494 --> 01:04:01.452
You know, I have been trying to come up
with a way to describe you to my friends,

01:04:01.536 --> 01:04:02.993
and now I finally have it.
Thank you so much.

01:04:04.327 --> 01:04:06.493
Fuck you.

01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:08.909
You want to get that?

01:04:08.994 --> 01:04:10.701
No, no. I want
to get some of this.

01:04:11.869 --> 01:04:12.993
Paul, it's Joni.

01:04:13.077 --> 01:04:17.243
I just wanted to call you
and apologize for my friend Sasha.

01:04:17.327 --> 01:04:19.659
You know, when you put
your hands on her shoulders,

01:04:19.744 --> 01:04:21.326
I think that
she thought that...

01:04:21.411 --> 01:04:23.076
Hey, Joni. It's Paul.
Don't get that.

01:04:23.161 --> 01:04:25.076
Listen, I'm really sorry
about Sasha the other night.

01:04:25.161 --> 01:04:29.534
No, I didn't even... No, no. No...
Really, I didn't even notice that.

01:04:29.618 --> 01:04:30.576
I hope you didn't
feel uncomfortable.

01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:33.326
No, not at all. I...

01:04:34.161 --> 01:04:35.243
Not at all.

01:04:35.327 --> 01:04:37.326
Okay, sure.
Well, as long as... Hold on, hold on.

01:04:37.411 --> 01:04:38.576
Wait, wait, wait.

01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:40.076
No, just get off me.

01:04:40.161 --> 01:04:41.368
I'm just gonna...
Give me one second.

01:04:41.453 --> 01:04:43.243
Get off.

01:04:44.327 --> 01:04:45.368
Jone?

01:04:45.453 --> 01:04:46.701
Oh, is my mom there?

01:04:46.785 --> 01:04:49.951
Your mom?
No, no. She split.

01:04:50.035 --> 01:04:52.243
She went on
a Home Depot run.

01:04:59.702 --> 01:05:00.909
Did you go to Home Depot?

01:05:00.994 --> 01:05:03.076
Yeah. J ust got back.

01:05:04.827 --> 01:05:06.868
That was fast.

01:05:06.952 --> 01:05:08.492
Yeah, no lines.

01:05:14.327 --> 01:05:16.701
What's that look
you're giving me?

01:05:16.785 --> 01:05:17.868
What look?

01:05:17.952 --> 01:05:21.368
The look that you're
giving me right now.

01:05:21.453 --> 01:05:25.326
No. That's no look.
That's just my face.

01:05:25.411 --> 01:05:28.576
Yeah, I'm not gonna play
this game with you.

01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:31.076
You know, you can
keep your judgments to yourself.

01:05:31.161 --> 01:05:33.368
No. I didn't give
no looks, señora.

01:05:33.453 --> 01:05:36.034
I don't ask
why you blow your nose all the time.

01:05:36.119 --> 01:05:38.160
If you have a drug problem,
then that's your business.

01:05:38.244 --> 01:05:40.868
No, I don't have
no drug problem.

01:05:40.952 --> 01:05:41.951
I have allergies.

01:05:42.035 --> 01:05:44.743
Then why are
you a gardener?

01:05:44.827 --> 01:05:46.993
'Cause I love
the flowers.

01:05:48.161 --> 01:05:49.743
Man, this is
not gonna work.

01:05:49.827 --> 01:05:51.993
You know, I'm gonna pay you
through the end of the day,

01:05:52.077 --> 01:05:54.410
and then we're through. Okay?

01:05:55.785 --> 01:05:56.909
Thank you very much.

01:05:56.994 --> 01:05:58.659
Thanks. Thank you.

01:06:01.869 --> 01:06:02.909
Can we talk about...

01:06:02.994 --> 01:06:04.076
No, we can't.

01:06:04.161 --> 01:06:05.743
A little bit.
You know why?

01:06:05.827 --> 01:06:07.285
'Cause there's nothing
to talk about.

01:06:07.369 --> 01:06:09.160
I think you know.

01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:12.160
You know.

01:06:58.952 --> 01:07:00.034
Look.

01:07:01.493 --> 01:07:04.368
I know you've all
been enjoying your time with Paul.

01:07:04.452 --> 01:07:09.409
And I know that I haven't
been as open to him as everybody else,

01:07:09.493 --> 01:07:11.659
and that's caused some
friction between us.

01:07:11.744 --> 01:07:15.576
But I'd like to try
and change that, okay?

01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:17.576
So I was thinking

01:07:17.660 --> 01:07:20.784
it might be nice if we all had dinner at
his house sometime.

01:07:20.869 --> 01:07:23.160
Now that way, I could get to know him
a little bit better,

01:07:23.244 --> 01:07:28.076
and I could see all the good work
that Mom's been doing in the backyard.

01:07:30.493 --> 01:07:32.076
What do you think? Yeah?
Sure.

01:07:32.161 --> 01:07:33.243
Yeah.
Sure.

01:07:33.327 --> 01:07:34.409
Yeah?

01:07:34.493 --> 01:07:35.576
Yeah.

01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:36.784
Great.

01:07:36.869 --> 01:07:39.201
It's not...
I'm not done yet.

01:07:39.286 --> 01:07:40.367
You know,
I'm not, you know...

01:07:40.452 --> 01:07:41.617
No. No, I know.

01:07:41.702 --> 01:07:43.617
I haven't done all
the planting or anything.

01:07:43.702 --> 01:07:45.076
But I wanna see
the process.

01:07:45.161 --> 01:07:47.367
You know, like other colors,
other than green colors.

01:07:47.452 --> 01:07:50.243
Well, that's okay.
I just wanna see the process.

01:07:50.326 --> 01:07:51.826
Great.

01:07:54.618 --> 01:07:55.659
Hey.

01:07:57.994 --> 01:07:59.701
Need a hand?
Sure.

01:08:05.161 --> 01:08:06.659
Hold on.
Let me help you.

01:08:06.744 --> 01:08:08.701
Ready? Okay.

01:08:08.785 --> 01:08:10.160
Right here.

01:08:12.535 --> 01:08:13.617
Yeah.

01:08:20.493 --> 01:08:21.701
We can't be doing this.

01:08:21.785 --> 01:08:24.408
I know. This is...

01:08:24.493 --> 01:08:25.826
I'm married.

01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:27.201
The kids.

01:08:27.286 --> 01:08:29.533
Yeah, and I love Nic, so...

01:08:29.618 --> 01:08:31.201
Hey.
I don't...

01:08:31.285 --> 01:08:32.868
It was fun while it lasted.

01:08:33.618 --> 01:08:34.783
Sorry.

01:08:39.202 --> 01:08:41.908
I bought you
some cigarettes.

01:08:41.993 --> 01:08:45.826
Jesus. What is
wrong with me?

01:08:47.535 --> 01:08:50.701
I shouldn't have fired Luis like that.
That was so wrong.

01:08:50.785 --> 01:08:52.908
Yeah, I think you're
being hard on yourself.

01:08:52.993 --> 01:08:55.451
You know, I mean,
things just get messed up sometimes.

01:08:55.535 --> 01:08:59.658
No, no, that wasn't messy.
That was fucked up.

01:09:01.952 --> 01:09:04.160
I am so fucked up.

01:09:06.827 --> 01:09:07.868
I...

01:09:09.827 --> 01:09:12.118
I think
I'm falling for you.

01:09:13.993 --> 01:09:15.492
Oh, God, Paul.

01:09:17.077 --> 01:09:18.242
Don't.

01:09:43.493 --> 01:09:44.951
Tonight was
a really good night.

01:09:45.035 --> 01:09:46.076
Yeah.

01:09:46.161 --> 01:09:49.617
That one table had, like,
five bottles of wine.

01:09:50.993 --> 01:09:53.658
It was crazy.
It was a big night.

01:09:54.243 --> 01:09:56.576
You know,
Joni's really pretty.

01:09:56.660 --> 01:09:59.076
I think she's got
some of your genes.

01:09:59.161 --> 01:10:01.743
You think? I think she looks more like
her mom, but thanks.

01:10:01.827 --> 01:10:03.076
I appreciate that.

01:10:03.744 --> 01:10:06.160
It was really cute
seeing you in Dad mode.

01:10:06.243 --> 01:10:07.492
Yeah?

01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:10.534
Yeah.

01:10:10.618 --> 01:10:12.617
It made me want
to fuck you.

01:10:13.744 --> 01:10:14.868
Yeah?

01:10:14.952 --> 01:10:15.993
Yeah.

01:10:16.077 --> 01:10:19.701
You know, I've been
missing our sleepovers.

01:10:19.785 --> 01:10:23.160
Yeah, we haven't
been doing that in a while, have we?

01:10:23.285 --> 01:10:24.784
Mmm-mmm.

01:10:27.201 --> 01:10:28.659
You want to meet up later?

01:10:29.910 --> 01:10:31.325
Tanya,

01:10:32.827 --> 01:10:35.826
you're so sexy
and beautiful, but I...

01:10:37.368 --> 01:10:40.200
I don't think
we should do that anymore.

01:10:41.368 --> 01:10:44.367
You know,
what we have is really fun and easy,

01:10:44.452 --> 01:10:48.534
but I don't want to be that, like, 50-year-old
guy who's just hanging out, you know?

01:10:48.618 --> 01:10:50.451
I really do want
to have a family,

01:10:50.535 --> 01:10:55.159
and I need to be doing that with someone
who's, like, ready to go there with me.

01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:57.076
Oh.

01:11:00.994 --> 01:11:02.076
Okay.

01:11:04.243 --> 01:11:05.409
Tanya.

01:11:11.285 --> 01:11:13.743
Yeah? Fuck you.

01:11:39.368 --> 01:11:40.784
It's locked.

01:11:49.118 --> 01:11:52.242
Yeah, I mean, obviously I have
more to do down here.

01:11:52.326 --> 01:11:54.743
I gotta fill it in,
but this is the general idea.

01:11:54.827 --> 01:11:57.367
No, it looks great.

01:11:57.452 --> 01:11:58.451
Yeah?

01:11:58.535 --> 01:11:59.576
It's so indigenous.

01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:01.325
Really.
I am so proud of you.

01:12:01.410 --> 01:12:04.284
Yeah, you like it?
Yeah?

01:12:04.368 --> 01:12:05.993
I'm so proud.

01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:12.117
I love you, honey.

01:12:12.201 --> 01:12:13.993
I love you, too.

01:12:14.076 --> 01:12:16.117
I'm so glad you like it.
It's incredible.

01:12:16.201 --> 01:12:17.242
Oh, man.

01:12:17.326 --> 01:12:19.242
And now, wait,
how's that guy Luis working out?

01:12:19.326 --> 01:12:21.367
Man, I had to fire him.

01:12:21.452 --> 01:12:22.451
Oh, my God.

01:12:22.535 --> 01:12:24.242
Yeah, he has
a drug problem.

01:12:24.326 --> 01:12:25.409
You're kidding!
What drug?

01:12:25.493 --> 01:12:26.617
No. I know... I...

01:12:26.702 --> 01:12:27.784
Blow, I think.

01:12:28.577 --> 01:12:30.242
You're a natural, kid.

01:12:43.326 --> 01:12:45.117
I know.
Good.

01:12:46.076 --> 01:12:47.325
You're a natural.

01:12:51.243 --> 01:12:53.451
You can never have
too much olive oil.

01:12:53.535 --> 01:12:54.534
Big no-no.

01:12:58.368 --> 01:12:59.701
Oh! I forgot.

01:12:59.785 --> 01:13:04.659
N ic, I got a bitching 1998 Alma Rosa that
I think you're just gonna love.

01:13:04.744 --> 01:13:07.242
You know what? I think I'm gonna stick
with water, but thank you so much.

01:13:07.326 --> 01:13:08.909
You sure?
Yeah.

01:13:08.994 --> 01:13:10.159
Jules.

01:13:11.368 --> 01:13:12.409
Paul, this steak
is delicious.

01:13:12.493 --> 01:13:13.617
Thank you.

01:13:13.702 --> 01:13:16.451
Really, it's...
What is the seasoning?

01:13:16.535 --> 01:13:19.743
Guys, we just misted it
with a little truffle oil, right?

01:13:19.827 --> 01:13:20.826
Mmm-hmm.

01:13:20.910 --> 01:13:22.242
It's so easy.
Wow.

01:13:22.326 --> 01:13:25.033
What a good idea.
We ought to try that. Right, honey?

01:13:25.118 --> 01:13:26.117
Mmm-hmm.

01:13:26.201 --> 01:13:27.909
And it's done
to perfection.

01:13:27.993 --> 01:13:29.075
Yeah?
It's not too rare?

01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:30.242
Oh, no, no.

01:13:30.326 --> 01:13:33.701
It's juicy and tender.
Exactly what rare's supposed to be.

01:13:33.785 --> 01:13:35.992
Right? I mean, I got people
coming into the restaurant,

01:13:36.076 --> 01:13:38.826
they see the slightest
bit of red, they just start freaking out.

01:13:38.910 --> 01:13:40.743
Isn't that annoying?

01:13:40.827 --> 01:13:42.951
That happens to me
all the time when I'm grilling.

01:13:43.034 --> 01:13:44.200
Hey, red is rare.

01:13:44.285 --> 01:13:45.826
Hello, it's bloody.

01:13:45.910 --> 01:13:47.409
I mean...
Hello?

01:13:47.493 --> 01:13:48.784
Yoo-hoo.
Hello, thank you.

01:13:48.869 --> 01:13:51.784
Yeah, I mean, if you're in Argentina,
and you ask for rare,

01:13:51.869 --> 01:13:54.992
they bring you a cow
still mooing on the plate.

01:13:56.201 --> 01:13:58.576
I really want to go to Argentina. Buenos
Aires is supposed to be...

01:13:58.660 --> 01:14:01.992
Hey. I noticed
your record collection over there.

01:14:02.076 --> 01:14:04.743
Wow, it's quite an
eclectic mix, you know.

01:14:04.827 --> 01:14:06.576
Thank you very much, N ic.

01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:07.992
You're welcome.

01:14:08.076 --> 01:14:10.367
You don't meet too many straight guys
who love Joni Mitchell.

01:14:10.452 --> 01:14:12.284
You sure don't.

01:14:12.368 --> 01:14:13.784
You like Joni?

01:14:14.201 --> 01:14:18.075
No, not really. We just named our
daughter after her.

01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:21.242
Really?
Oh, shut the front door.

01:14:21.326 --> 01:14:24.576
Come on. Really? You never told me
you were named after Joni M.

01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:26.242
It's so dorky.
I don't like to bring it up.

01:14:26.326 --> 01:14:27.451
That is so cool.

01:14:27.535 --> 01:14:30.325
No, what's your
favorite Joni album? It's not cool.

01:14:30.535 --> 01:14:31.534
Blue.

01:14:32.993 --> 01:14:36.284
Right? My brother
from another mother.

01:14:36.368 --> 01:14:38.325
Oh, my God.
I mean...

01:14:38.410 --> 01:14:43.075
Listen, I spent half of high school in my
room crying to that album.

01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:46.117
That record,
it kills me.

01:14:46.201 --> 01:14:47.784
It doesn't stop.
No.

01:14:47.869 --> 01:14:50.701
River. California.

01:14:51.326 --> 01:14:52.367
A Case Of You.

01:14:52.452 --> 01:14:53.492
All I Want.

01:14:53.618 --> 01:14:55.242
Oh, God.
Right?

01:14:57.785 --> 01:14:59.950
I am on a lonely road

01:15:00.034 --> 01:15:04.451
And I am traveling,
traveling, traveling

01:15:04.535 --> 01:15:06.159
Looking for something

01:15:06.243 --> 01:15:08.659
What can it be

01:15:08.744 --> 01:15:12.200
I hate you some,
I hate you some

01:15:12.285 --> 01:15:15.409
I love you some

01:15:15.493 --> 01:15:17.075
I love you

01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:20.534
When I forget about me

01:15:20.618 --> 01:15:22.701
I want to talk to you

01:15:22.785 --> 01:15:24.576
I want to shampoo you

01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:28.242
I want to renew you
again and again

01:15:28.326 --> 01:15:29.992
Applause, applause

01:15:30.076 --> 01:15:31.617
Life is our cause

01:15:31.702 --> 01:15:33.284
When I think of your kisses

01:15:33.368 --> 01:15:35.325
My mind see-saws

01:15:35.410 --> 01:15:37.159
Do you see,
do you see

01:15:42.034 --> 01:15:43.992
Do you see, do you see

01:15:44.076 --> 01:15:47.908
Do you see how
you hurt me, baby

01:15:48.368 --> 01:15:50.950
And I hurt you, too

01:15:51.034 --> 01:15:54.033
That's why we both get

01:15:54.118 --> 01:15:59.784
so blue

01:16:02.201 --> 01:16:03.659
Bravo.

01:16:07.034 --> 01:16:08.908
Don't quit your
day job, Mom.

01:16:08.993 --> 01:16:12.367
Hey. It's already hard enough to
open your heart in this world.

01:16:12.452 --> 01:16:14.451
Don't make it any harder.

01:16:15.410 --> 01:16:18.617
You're right. I'm sorry.
It was a wonderful rendition.

01:16:18.702 --> 01:16:20.117
Beautiful, thank you.

01:16:20.201 --> 01:16:21.409
I like this guy.

01:16:23.493 --> 01:16:24.992
Why, thank you, N ic.

01:16:31.326 --> 01:16:33.033
Okay. Paul,
where's your bathroom?

01:16:33.118 --> 01:16:35.075
It's just right here
around the corner.

01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:36.451
All right. Thanks.

01:16:36.535 --> 01:16:41.992
And you know what? I am gonna have
a glass of the Alma Rosa, okay?

01:16:42.076 --> 01:16:43.409
All right.

01:16:46.243 --> 01:16:50.284
So, I think you'd
really love Argentina.

01:16:50.368 --> 01:16:51.576
I really
wanna go there.

01:16:51.660 --> 01:16:53.451
Buenos Aires
is literally, like,

01:16:53.535 --> 01:16:56.659
one of the most beautiful
cities in the world.

01:17:48.826 --> 01:17:51.033
I was in a rainstorm
in the Grand Canyon.

01:17:51.118 --> 01:17:52.576
Can we go?
I'll take you.

01:18:12.326 --> 01:18:17.033
A big rattlesnake
when I was in the desert in Baja, Mexico.

01:18:17.118 --> 01:18:19.659
We should.
I'll take you to Baja.

01:18:19.743 --> 01:18:21.783
I was in the desert and...

01:18:21.868 --> 01:18:23.075
What's it like there?

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:24.867
It's beautiful.

01:18:24.951 --> 01:18:28.242
I was surfing, but then
there was no waves,

01:18:28.326 --> 01:18:30.908
so we climbed up
into the mountains.

01:18:30.993 --> 01:18:34.242
And I hear a rattling,
and it was a rattlesnake.

01:18:34.326 --> 01:18:37.325
And so I was scrambling.
I didn't know what to do,

01:18:37.410 --> 01:18:41.700
so I reached out for a rock, and then
I threw it at the rattlesnake...

01:19:08.993 --> 01:19:10.617
Did you guys spend
some time up there?

01:19:10.701 --> 01:19:13.783
Yeah, a long time ago.
Yeah. Yeah.

01:19:13.868 --> 01:19:16.075
Beautiful, beautiful beaches.
You'd like it.

01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:19.700
It's really nice
having you guys over.

01:19:19.784 --> 01:19:22.700
I don't entertain here
very much.

01:19:22.784 --> 01:19:23.992
Cheers.

01:19:25.535 --> 01:19:27.409
All right.
All right.

01:19:29.493 --> 01:19:31.617
To an unconventional family.

01:19:53.868 --> 01:19:57.075
You and Paul
were getting along like gang-busters.

01:20:10.034 --> 01:20:12.825
You're sleeping
with him, aren't you?

01:20:12.909 --> 01:20:13.992
What?

01:20:16.951 --> 01:20:19.825
J ust be honest
with me, okay?

01:20:19.909 --> 01:20:23.075
Don't make me feel crazier
than I feel right now.

01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:27.742
Where is this coming from?
I don't...

01:20:27.826 --> 01:20:30.908
Well, I found your hair
in his drain.

01:20:37.201 --> 01:20:38.284
Because...

01:20:38.368 --> 01:20:42.159
Because I was working,
and I got dirty, and I took a shower.

01:20:44.410 --> 01:20:47.451
Yeah?
Did you take a nap, too?

01:20:52.993 --> 01:20:55.033
Are you in love with him?

01:20:57.368 --> 01:21:01.200
No.

01:21:02.951 --> 01:21:04.367
Are you straight now?

01:21:04.452 --> 01:21:07.616
No. It has nothing
to do with that!

01:21:07.701 --> 01:21:11.658
I've just felt so far away
from you lately.

01:21:11.743 --> 01:21:13.742
Oh, right.
So it's my fault?

01:21:13.826 --> 01:21:16.075
No! Who said
anything about fault?

01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:17.533
Just listen to me!

01:21:17.617 --> 01:21:18.908
I'm listening!

01:21:18.993 --> 01:21:20.950
What?

01:21:21.034 --> 01:21:23.658
I just... I just...

01:21:24.743 --> 01:21:25.742
I needed...

01:21:25.826 --> 01:21:27.616
What? To be fucked?

01:21:27.701 --> 01:21:31.075
No. Appreciated.

01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:35.200
Well, it's always what
I'm not doing for you, isn't it?

01:21:35.285 --> 01:21:40.117
Well, okay.
Here's what I don't do to you.

01:21:40.201 --> 01:21:43.825
I don't work out my issues
by fucking other people!

01:21:43.909 --> 01:21:45.908
He's not just "other people."

01:21:45.993 --> 01:21:48.575
No! He's our sperm donor.

01:21:48.659 --> 01:21:50.783
You couldn't have picked
a more painful way to hurt me.

01:21:50.868 --> 01:21:52.075
Where are you going?

01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:53.451
I need water!

01:21:54.576 --> 01:21:55.575
Oh!

01:21:57.492 --> 01:21:58.616
Shit!

01:22:01.576 --> 01:22:02.742
Shit.

01:22:30.743 --> 01:22:32.742
Joni.

01:22:32.826 --> 01:22:33.950
I don't want
to talk to you.

01:22:34.034 --> 01:22:35.325
Can we just talk
about what happened?

01:22:35.410 --> 01:22:39.200
I said I don't
want to talk to you.

01:22:39.285 --> 01:22:42.742
Okay. I understand.

01:22:50.784 --> 01:22:53.409
Laser? Honey?

01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:57.242
What?

01:22:58.243 --> 01:23:02.616
I know that
you and Joni heard what was going on,

01:23:02.701 --> 01:23:07.783
and I wanted to tell you that what
happened with me and Paul is over.

01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:11.367
There's nothing
going on now.

01:23:12.492 --> 01:23:13.575
Okay.

01:23:13.659 --> 01:23:18.325
I know it'll probably take you a while to
process your feelings around this,

01:23:18.409 --> 01:23:23.242
but I just wanted to tell you that I'm here
if you ever want to talk about anything.

01:23:26.326 --> 01:23:28.742
Is there anything
you want to talk about?

01:23:28.826 --> 01:23:30.159
Not really.

01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:53.325
How's Nic?

01:23:53.409 --> 01:23:55.075
She's a mess.

01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:59.533
They're not talking.
I've never seen her like that.

01:24:08.118 --> 01:24:09.366
Is it him?

01:24:09.451 --> 01:24:10.491
Hello?

01:24:10.576 --> 01:24:12.408
Hey, darling.
How you doing?

01:24:12.492 --> 01:24:14.200
You're such a phony.

01:24:16.326 --> 01:24:17.408
Excuse me?

01:24:17.492 --> 01:24:20.408
You act like you're
so groovy and together, but you're not.

01:24:20.492 --> 01:24:23.117
You're a shitty person!

01:24:23.201 --> 01:24:24.533
Oh, no.

01:24:25.659 --> 01:24:26.700
What happened?

01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:28.908
With my mom?

01:24:30.367 --> 01:24:33.616
Listen, you gotta let me
just come and talk to you, honey, please.

01:24:33.701 --> 01:24:34.825
What's wrong with you?

01:24:34.909 --> 01:24:36.742
Joni, listen to me. Please...

01:24:36.826 --> 01:24:38.575
Don't call me again.

01:24:44.076 --> 01:24:47.700
Hey, Paul, look at these cukes.
Aren't they awesome?

01:24:47.784 --> 01:24:48.825
No.

01:24:49.492 --> 01:24:50.533
Fuck.

01:24:51.826 --> 01:24:52.908
Fuck!

01:24:54.285 --> 01:24:55.491
Hello?

01:24:55.576 --> 01:24:57.033
I just talked to Joni.

01:24:57.118 --> 01:24:59.159
What happened?
What's going on?

01:24:59.243 --> 01:25:01.616
N ic found my hair
in your bathroom.

01:25:02.409 --> 01:25:04.159
Fuck.
I n the drain.

01:25:04.243 --> 01:25:05.408
The other night?

01:25:05.492 --> 01:25:06.658
Yeah.

01:25:06.743 --> 01:25:08.366
Oh, my God.

01:25:08.451 --> 01:25:10.033
Hey, you know what?

01:25:10.118 --> 01:25:13.075
I just say we go for it.
I mean, it's all out in the open now.

01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:14.992
I mean,
let's just do this thing.

01:25:15.076 --> 01:25:16.242
Paul...

01:25:16.325 --> 01:25:18.408
I don't care what you say,
Jules. We can...

01:25:18.492 --> 01:25:20.533
This can work, you know.
This isn't a mistake.

01:25:20.617 --> 01:25:21.616
Paul.

01:25:21.701 --> 01:25:23.242
This isn't just happening
for no reason.

01:25:23.325 --> 01:25:24.616
Let's get
the kids together.

01:25:24.701 --> 01:25:26.742
Paul, come on.
I'm sick of this life.

01:25:26.826 --> 01:25:28.033
Let's make this happen.
I'm ready.

01:25:28.118 --> 01:25:29.159
I'm gay.

01:25:29.243 --> 01:25:30.825
Fuck it. I wanna...

01:25:30.909 --> 01:25:32.700
Jesus.

01:25:33.868 --> 01:25:35.033
Hello?

01:25:45.576 --> 01:25:48.324
Hey, hey.
Slow down, tiger.

01:25:49.451 --> 01:25:50.658
You don't wanna get sick.

01:25:50.743 --> 01:25:51.992
I'm fine.

01:25:56.534 --> 01:25:59.200
Are you gonna
talk to him?

01:25:59.284 --> 01:26:00.366
Yeah.

01:26:06.701 --> 01:26:08.783
Hey.
Hey.

01:26:12.242 --> 01:26:13.908
I like the scruff.
It's sexy.

01:26:15.659 --> 01:26:16.742
Thank you.

01:26:16.826 --> 01:26:19.283
Excuse me.
We're in the middle of a conversation.

01:26:19.367 --> 01:26:20.867
That's okay.

01:26:20.951 --> 01:26:21.908
Can I talk to you?

01:26:21.993 --> 01:26:23.200
Yeah.

01:26:26.118 --> 01:26:27.616
Excuse me.

01:26:33.325 --> 01:26:36.825
Green chilies, queso sauce,
blue corn tortillas.

01:26:36.909 --> 01:26:38.700
This is a poblano pepper.

01:26:39.284 --> 01:26:40.950
So, what's up?

01:27:19.492 --> 01:27:21.241
Are you okay?

01:27:21.325 --> 01:27:22.450
Fine.

01:27:34.909 --> 01:27:38.867
I just wanted to get another pillow.
The couch is really saggy.

01:27:42.993 --> 01:27:44.199
Your back hurts?

01:27:44.284 --> 01:27:46.825
Yeah. It's super achy.

01:27:49.701 --> 01:27:52.158
Well, you should
take some Advil.

01:28:02.617 --> 01:28:04.700
Hey, how was the party?

01:28:06.284 --> 01:28:07.408
Fine.

01:28:07.492 --> 01:28:10.241
Were there a lot
of people there?

01:28:10.951 --> 01:28:12.116
I don't know.

01:28:15.242 --> 01:28:17.033
Are you drunk, honey?

01:28:17.117 --> 01:28:18.158
No.

01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:23.742
Hey, did you drive
yourself home?

01:28:23.826 --> 01:28:26.658
Yeah. What's the big deal?
I'm not drunk.

01:28:28.993 --> 01:28:30.366
You seem drunk to me.

01:28:30.451 --> 01:28:32.408
Yeah, well,
you should know.

01:28:32.492 --> 01:28:33.825
What did you say to me?

01:28:33.909 --> 01:28:35.783
Nothing. I'm going to bed.
Hey, honey. I...

01:28:35.868 --> 01:28:39.992
What do you want from me?
I did everything you wanted!

01:28:40.075 --> 01:28:43.491
I got all A's!
I got into every school I applied!

01:28:43.576 --> 01:28:46.867
Now you can show everyone
what a perfect lesbian family you have!

01:28:46.951 --> 01:28:48.366
Don't talk to your
mom like that!

01:28:48.451 --> 01:28:51.742
You're really gonna
tell me how to act? Now?

01:28:51.826 --> 01:28:53.324
You know what?
I am still your mother, and you...

01:28:53.409 --> 01:28:56.950
Don't touch me!
I'm so sick of both of you!

01:30:13.992 --> 01:30:16.366
Hey, did you remember
to pack the lamp I gave you?

01:30:16.451 --> 01:30:17.450
Mmm-hmm.

01:30:18.492 --> 01:30:20.533
Well, we can always
get stuff there, you know.

01:30:20.617 --> 01:30:25.491
I mean, if your room's
too dark, or you need extra bedding or...

01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:29.450
I'm not going
to Siberia, Mom.

01:30:30.951 --> 01:30:33.991
I can't believe
it's your last dinner at home.

01:30:36.325 --> 01:30:38.658
Are you seriously
about to cry?

01:30:39.992 --> 01:30:43.199
I wish you were gay.
You'd be much more sensitive.

01:30:48.325 --> 01:30:50.825
That's probably Sasha.
I'll get it.

01:30:52.451 --> 01:30:53.742
How long a drive is it?

01:30:53.826 --> 01:30:55.616
About eight
hours, I think.

01:30:57.992 --> 01:30:59.408
What are you doing here?

01:30:59.492 --> 01:31:03.032
I just needed to talk to you
before you left. Please.

01:31:08.159 --> 01:31:09.491
There's nothing
to talk about.

01:31:12.659 --> 01:31:14.783
I wanted to apologize again.

01:31:16.701 --> 01:31:19.199
I can't tell you

01:31:20.451 --> 01:31:24.700
how ashamed,
how much I regret what happened.

01:31:24.784 --> 01:31:27.450
So, like, everything that
happened between us,

01:31:27.534 --> 01:31:29.575
what was that?
That was just bullshit?

01:31:29.659 --> 01:31:33.199
No, no.
It wasn't bullshit at all.

01:31:35.033 --> 01:31:36.158
Okay?

01:31:38.701 --> 01:31:42.241
I know that I don't
have much credibility right now,

01:31:42.325 --> 01:31:47.241
but I really, really
care about you.

01:31:49.659 --> 01:31:52.408
And I wanna know that I'm gonna be able
to see you again someday.

01:31:52.492 --> 01:31:55.700
I mean, I...
Do you think that could ever happen?

01:31:59.659 --> 01:32:01.158
I don't know.

01:32:02.534 --> 01:32:05.158
I just wish that
you could've been...

01:32:06.784 --> 01:32:07.866
What?

01:32:10.950 --> 01:32:12.283
Better.

01:32:18.659 --> 01:32:19.658
Oh.

01:32:20.451 --> 01:32:21.742
You have got
some balls, mister.

01:32:21.826 --> 01:32:22.907
Hold on, N ic.

01:32:22.992 --> 01:32:24.700
No, no, no.
You hold on.

01:32:24.992 --> 01:32:27.742
You know what
you did to my kids?

01:32:27.826 --> 01:32:28.907
Shit.

01:32:30.325 --> 01:32:34.991
Let me tell you something,
man, this is not your family.

01:32:35.617 --> 01:32:37.575
This is my family!
I know that, Nic.

01:32:37.659 --> 01:32:39.742
No, you don't know.

01:32:39.826 --> 01:32:41.991
You don't know,
and you know why?

01:32:42.075 --> 01:32:44.241
Because you're
a fucking interloper.

01:32:44.992 --> 01:32:48.658
If you want a family so much,
you go out and make your own!

01:33:55.617 --> 01:33:56.742
I need to say something.

01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:04.283
It's no big secret your mom and
I are in hell right now, and...

01:34:06.492 --> 01:34:10.658
Bottom line is,
marriage is hard.

01:34:10.743 --> 01:34:12.032
It's really fucking hard.

01:34:12.576 --> 01:34:15.366
Just two people

01:34:15.451 --> 01:34:20.241
slogging through the shit,
year after year, getting older, changing.

01:34:21.033 --> 01:34:23.283
It's a fucking
marathon, okay?

01:34:24.409 --> 01:34:28.241
So, sometimes, you know,
you're together so long, that you just...

01:34:28.325 --> 01:34:29.949
You stop seeing
the other person.

01:34:30.033 --> 01:34:34.116
You just see
weird projections of your own junk.

01:34:34.701 --> 01:34:39.283
Instead of talking
to each other, you go off the rails

01:34:39.367 --> 01:34:43.366
and act grubby and make stupid choices,
which is what I did.

01:34:43.451 --> 01:34:47.949
And I feel sick about it because I love you
guys, and I love your mom,

01:34:49.325 --> 01:34:51.283
and that's the truth.

01:34:52.825 --> 01:34:56.699
Sometimes you hurt the ones you love
the most. I don't know why.

01:34:56.783 --> 01:35:00.241
You know, if I read more
Russian novels, then...

01:35:04.117 --> 01:35:05.699
Anyway...

01:35:10.492 --> 01:35:14.199
I just wanted to say
how sorry I am for what I did.

01:35:17.451 --> 01:35:19.991
I hope you'll
forgive me eventually.

01:35:24.908 --> 01:35:26.241
Thank you.

01:37:50.867 --> 01:37:52.283
Oh!

01:37:54.451 --> 01:37:55.824
N ice, huh?
This is big.

01:37:55.908 --> 01:37:58.782
It's bigger than
I thought it would be.

01:37:58.867 --> 01:38:00.450
Okay.

01:38:00.575 --> 01:38:02.574
Did you remember the lamp? Thank God.
Here it is. Here.

01:38:02.658 --> 01:38:03.699
Honey, where
do you want this?

01:38:03.783 --> 01:38:05.532
Do you want it on your desk?
Do you want it next to the bed?

01:38:05.616 --> 01:38:06.824
Guys, I've got it.

01:38:06.908 --> 01:38:09.699
I think the sheets
are in here. Mom.

01:38:09.783 --> 01:38:12.450
Guys, I can do it, okay?
No, no, I can do it.

01:38:12.533 --> 01:38:13.574
Mom.

01:38:13.658 --> 01:38:14.907
Is that...

01:38:14.992 --> 01:38:17.615
Mom, I got it.
I can do it.

01:38:17.700 --> 01:38:21.699
Thanks. Can I just have a minute,
please? Okay?

01:38:21.783 --> 01:38:23.615
Okay.
Okay.

01:38:23.700 --> 01:38:24.741
Okay?

01:38:24.825 --> 01:38:25.907
Okay.

01:38:27.117 --> 01:38:28.283
Great.

01:39:42.992 --> 01:39:44.074
Hey.

01:39:44.159 --> 01:39:45.324
Where'd you guys go?

01:39:45.409 --> 01:39:46.615
We had to move the car.

01:39:46.700 --> 01:39:48.490
I thought you left.

01:39:49.533 --> 01:39:51.324
We wouldn't leave
without saying goodbye.

01:39:51.408 --> 01:39:52.866
Give us some credit.

01:39:59.242 --> 01:40:01.407
It's gonna be weird
not having you around anymore.

01:40:01.491 --> 01:40:04.407
Sorry to leave you
alone with them.

01:40:04.491 --> 01:40:06.407
It'll be okay.

01:40:21.242 --> 01:40:22.991
Hey, guys, come on.

01:40:28.159 --> 01:40:31.574
Hey, it's okay.
I'll speak to you soon, okay?

01:40:37.159 --> 01:40:38.324
Okay.

01:41:49.159 --> 01:41:53.116
I don't think you guys
should break up.

01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:55.074
No? Why's that?

01:41:57.159 --> 01:41:59.032
I think you're too old.

01:42:01.950 --> 01:42:03.574
Thanks, Laser.
