03:51.764 --> 03:54.266
My brother's right.

03:56.436 --> 03:58.737
You're a good fighter.

04:04.310 --> 04:06.945
Don't spend it all in one place.

04:22.629 --> 04:25.297
Time to meet the devil.

05:03.703 --> 05:06.738
Are those women?

05:06.740 --> 05:09.341
Yeah, 50 percent.

05:11.678 --> 05:15.414
I'm looking for a girl. A young girl.

05:15.416 --> 05:18.317
I want to fuck a 14-year-old.

05:18.319 --> 05:21.353
Only what you see.

05:21.355 --> 05:25.057
Let me ask you a question.

05:25.059 --> 05:27.359
You got a daughter?

05:28.394 --> 05:30.562
Bring her in.

05:30.564 --> 05:34.499
I'll pay you 15,000 baht.

05:34.501 --> 05:37.602
No, no, no. Sorry.

05:55.655 --> 05:57.356
Hello.

05:57.358 --> 06:01.660
Hey, not do like that. Come on. Oh...

08:05.088 --> 08:08.146
Hello, sir.
Right this way, please.

09:13.730 --> 09:16.844
She's your daughter?

09:26.720 --> 09:29.256
How could you do it?

09:36.780 --> 09:40.062
How could you let this happen?

09:42.802 --> 09:45.303
I didn't do anything.

09:47.703 --> 09:49.798
Now's your chance to do something.

09:54.095 --> 09:57.095
Do what you want.

11:11.965 --> 11:16.317
Come with me.

11:26.344 --> 11:31.985
I'm sorry. My apologies.
Please don't kill me.

11:33.230 --> 11:35.395
What are you sorry for?

11:35.415 --> 11:41.022
You were there. You know what I did.
He killed my daughter.

11:42.462 --> 11:44.480
Why did you kill him?

11:45.565 --> 11:48.890
Beacause he murdered my daughter!

11:49.345 --> 11:54.590
You knew what your daughter was doing.
Why didn't you stop her?

11:54.595 --> 12:00.078
How else was I to make ends meet?
I have four daughters and no sons.

12:00.080 --> 12:02.028
What else was I supposed to do?

12:02.746 --> 12:05.600
Don't you understand?

12:05.605 --> 12:08.406
My daughter's just been murdered!

12:15.418 --> 12:18.985
This isn't about your dead daughter.

12:19.879 --> 12:24.345
It's about your three living daughters.

12:24.350 --> 12:30.042
This is to make sure you never forget them.

12:34.005 --> 12:38.545
Please. I'll be a better man.
No, please don't!

12:38.565 --> 12:40.625
No!

17:49.101 --> 17:51.569
It's about your brother.

17:53.639 --> 17:56.374
Billy's dead.

19:56.005 --> 19:57.858
Good morning.

19:58.152 --> 19:59.403
I'm checking in.

19:59.898 --> 20:02.567
One moment, please.

20:08.874 --> 20:14.745
I'm afraid the room wouldn't be
ready until four o'clock. It's a policy.

20:16.481 --> 20:18.849
Get your manager.

20:21.691 --> 20:26.073
Mr. Manager, could you please
come out to the reception?

20:28.660 --> 20:31.462
He'll be here in a minute.

20:38.370 --> 20:40.838
What's your problem?

20:45.390 --> 20:47.790
I have a guest here who'd like to talk to you.

20:47.793 --> 20:50.581
Good morning, madam.
How may I help you?

20:50.583 --> 20:52.750
Listen to me.

20:52.752 --> 20:55.453
I have just traveled 10,000 miles to see the corpse

20:55.455 --> 20:58.623
of my first-born son.
I haven't slept in 30 hours.

20:58.625 --> 21:01.792
And this bitch says I can't have my room.

22:21.529 --> 22:26.452
How are you?
Keep an eye on things, my child.

22:28.772 --> 22:31.000
Mother!

23:03.715 --> 23:07.151
Ask him why he killed my brother.

23:07.595 --> 23:10.000
Who hired you to kill his brother?

24:31.105 --> 24:33.700
Hello.

24:33.705 --> 24:37.653
- Sorry, I'm late.
- Don't worry about it.

24:42.804 --> 24:47.002
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

24:47.010 --> 24:52.768
- What did she have for dinner?
- Soup and rice with chicken.

24:58.235 --> 25:02.913
We have to leave him alone now.

25:02.920 --> 25:06.969
Then how do we make sure he doesn't cause trouble again?

25:08.115 --> 25:10.572
By talking nicely to each other.

27:23.375 --> 27:25.943
Did you miss me?

27:30.048 --> 27:32.983
I missed you so much.

27:54.205 --> 27:57.741
Did you get the guy that did it?

27:59.377 --> 28:02.279
How did you kill him?

28:04.249 --> 28:06.884
I let him go.

28:09.921 --> 28:12.756
Get the door.

28:16.728 --> 28:19.363
Are you out of your fucking mind?

28:19.365 --> 28:22.433
Some cunt killed your brother and you let him go?

28:22.435 --> 28:25.269
It's a little more complicated than that, Mother.

28:25.271 --> 28:28.105
Meaning what, exactly?

28:29.908 --> 28:33.911
Billy raped and killed a 16-year-old girl.

28:36.948 --> 28:39.416
I'm sure he had his reasons.

28:39.418 --> 28:41.719
Now sit!

29:01.906 --> 29:06.143
I know it's hard for you emotionally.

29:07.345 --> 29:13.217
You've lost your brother. Don't worry.

29:13.219 --> 29:17.955
I'll take care of the yellow
nigger who killed my son.

29:17.957 --> 29:20.224
It's too much for you.

29:24.095 --> 29:27.231
Now get up and kiss your mother.

30:20.318 --> 30:23.120
If you ever come back,

30:23.122 --> 30:25.389
I'll kill you.

30:38.469 --> 30:42.973
- Is it done?
- Yeah.

30:44.309 --> 30:46.944
How's business?

30:52.183 --> 30:54.985
Yeah, it's OK.

30:57.522 --> 31:01.058
I could do with having Billy back, though.

31:01.060 --> 31:04.261
Isn't Julian taking care of everything?

31:04.263 --> 31:07.898
He hasn't told you, has he?

31:09.567 --> 31:13.237
There was someone else involved -

31:13.239 --> 31:15.539
when Billy was killed.

31:15.541 --> 31:20.878
- Who?
- Some cop.

31:22.614 --> 31:24.882
Don't worry.

31:25.383 --> 31:27.651
I'll find him.

31:29.554 --> 31:31.989
And then we'll kill him.

31:34.359 --> 31:36.493
Good.

34:07.789 --> 34:09.312
Who is that?

34:10.420 --> 34:13.703
Maybe he'd like a whisky.
Would you like a whisky?

34:42.513 --> 34:45.415
She doesn't know what to think.

34:45.417 --> 34:47.818
He says he didn't see it, Mum.

34:47.820 --> 34:51.755
A foreigner called up Liang and spoke English.

34:51.757 --> 34:55.725
Then he went with him
and took the phone with him.

35:03.468 --> 35:08.405
Hey, Julian. The cops want to see you.

35:10.508 --> 35:14.311
- What do they want?
- Probably money.

35:14.313 --> 35:17.514
- You want me to ask how much?
- No, I'll go.

35:21.652 --> 35:24.154
You're Julian?

35:25.490 --> 35:29.726
- Do you know Choi Yan Lee?
- Who?

35:29.728 --> 35:33.330
Your brother killed his daughter.

35:34.499 --> 35:37.367
What's that have to do with me?

35:38.603 --> 35:41.471
Choi Yan Lee was murdered.

35:51.249 --> 35:55.919
- When?
- Yesterday.

36:44.012 --> 36:45.809
He's not the one.

39:26.630 --> 39:29.032
You can't go around killing cops anymore.

39:29.034 --> 39:32.135
How much do you want?

39:32.137 --> 39:35.472
It's not about the money.

39:35.474 --> 39:37.841
What's in it for me?

39:39.844 --> 39:44.848
I have five kilos of blow arriving Friday.
I need someone to help me move it.

39:46.050 --> 39:49.419
You got any questions, you ask him.

39:50.054 --> 39:52.789
And what about Julian?

39:55.659 --> 39:57.494
Don't worry about Julian.

39:57.496 --> 40:02.432
- Are you in or out?
- I'm in.

40:47.578 --> 40:50.547
I'd like you to meet my mother.

40:54.919 --> 40:58.455
I want us to pretend that we're a couple.

41:02.827 --> 41:04.994
Can you do that?

41:27.885 --> 41:30.587
Will you wear this?

42:17.868 --> 42:22.939
So, tell me, Mai. What line of work are you in?

42:22.941 --> 42:26.676
- I'm an entertainer.
- An entertainer?

42:26.678 --> 42:32.215
And how many cocks can you entertain
with that cute little cum-Dumpster of yours?

42:36.854 --> 42:39.756
What do you think of his line of work?

42:41.892 --> 42:44.260
I'm not talking about the fag boxing club.

42:44.262 --> 42:48.965
I'm talking about
where the money comes from.

42:48.967 --> 42:50.867
You know what he does, right?

42:52.970 --> 42:54.904
He deals drugs, Mai.

42:54.906 --> 42:58.308
Heroin, cocaine. That's
where the money comes from.

42:58.310 --> 43:01.578
That's how he can afford to pay you to fuck him.

43:06.350 --> 43:10.019
Oh, great. I'll get the crab.
He'll have the spicy chicken.

43:10.021 --> 43:15.892
And May here will have a salad
with the dressing on the side.

43:15.894 --> 43:18.361
It's Mai.

43:22.633 --> 43:25.201
I'm sorry.

43:25.203 --> 43:29.105
I apologize for my behavior.

43:29.107 --> 43:34.677
It's just that I'm a little upset.

43:34.679 --> 43:37.647
I have lost my first son.

43:41.986 --> 43:45.188
I'm sorry for that.

43:45.190 --> 43:47.256
Thank you.

43:48.659 --> 43:52.829
It's good to know someone cares.

43:52.831 --> 43:58.234
'Cause I swear to God, sometimes I think Julian hated Billy.
Maybe "hate" is the wrong word.

43:58.236 --> 44:01.704
But you were always jealous of him.

44:01.706 --> 44:07.343
You know the way boys are, May.
Competitive.

44:07.345 --> 44:12.015
And what with Billy being the older
brother and having a bigger cock...

44:12.017 --> 44:15.785
Julian's was never small, but Billy's was...

44:15.787 --> 44:18.755
Oh, it was enormous.

44:21.025 --> 44:23.426
How can you compete with that?

44:28.866 --> 44:33.670
Billy was everything Julian wanted to be.

44:37.341 --> 44:39.942
Is that not true?

44:43.881 --> 44:47.817
'Cause let me tell you, if the tables were turned,

44:47.819 --> 44:50.053
your brother would have found your killer

44:50.055 --> 44:54.357
and brought me his head on a fucking platter!

44:54.359 --> 45:00.296
And you just sit there thinking
he got what he deserved!

45:02.866 --> 45:05.234
Fuck you.

45:08.706 --> 45:13.776
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Do you mind if I smoke?

45:25.489 --> 45:28.357
You can keep that dress if you want to.

45:28.359 --> 45:30.860
I don't want it.

45:36.767 --> 45:39.769
Why do you let her treat you like that?

45:47.077 --> 45:49.812
'Cause she's my mother.

45:51.115 --> 45:56.085
Now if you don't want that dress, take it off.

46:15.839 --> 46:18.374
Take it off!

51:49.921 --> 51:53.398
Do you know why I'm here?

51:54.575 --> 51:56.400
Yes, I do.

51:56.410 --> 51:59.000
He's the one who planned it.

51:59.005 --> 52:02.715
You can ask him anything.

52:02.720 --> 52:07.300
Mind your own business.
No one's asking any questions.

52:07.305 --> 52:12.025
- Yes, sir.
- What's your excuse?

52:50.652 --> 52:53.549
I'm not afraid to face the consequences.

52:54.685 --> 52:59.880
I'm just asking you...

53:02.626 --> 53:05.223
...to spare my son.

53:08.702 --> 53:12.523
- It's like I told you.
- Mind your own business!

55:10.040 --> 55:12.474
Who the fuck are you?

55:12.476 --> 55:14.410
Get out of my club.

55:24.174 --> 55:29.838
Remember, girls, no matter what happens...

55:29.850 --> 55:32.432
...keep your eyes closed.

55:39.150 --> 55:41.225
And you men...

55:41.355 --> 55:44.115
Take a good look.

55:44.370 --> 55:46.542
Can somebody tell me

55:46.544 --> 55:49.478
what the fuck this cunt is trying to say?

55:50.513 --> 55:52.881
Who put out the hit?

55:55.919 --> 56:00.589
Go fuck yourself. How about that?

56:48.606 --> 56:50.170
Why?

56:50.400 --> 56:53.008
She said you murdered her son.

56:55.078 --> 56:58.680
She wanted you dead.

57:59.856 --> 58:02.126
Who is she?

58:02.825 --> 58:05.214
Fuck you.

58:28.685 --> 58:31.889
You can' see what is good for you.

58:40.326 --> 58:42.531
So it's better you don't see.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.920
You have an opportunity here.

59:24.205 --> 59:28.152
But you're stubborn.
You don't listen.

59:29.839 --> 59:32.250
If you don't want do listen,

59:32.255 --> 59:34.000
then stop listening.

01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:43.465
You know who he is?

01:02:26.242 --> 01:02:29.077
Want to fight?

01:08:45.187 --> 01:08:48.156
When I was pregnant with you...

01:08:50.158 --> 01:08:53.261
...it was strange. You were different.

01:08:56.599 --> 01:08:59.600
They wanted me to terminate...

01:09:01.337 --> 01:09:03.671
...but I wouldn't.

01:09:10.746 --> 01:09:13.281
And you're right.

01:09:14.383 --> 01:09:17.252
I don't understand you.

01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:30.532
And I never will.

01:09:37.706 --> 01:09:40.642
What have you done?

01:09:42.178 --> 01:09:45.380
I fucked up.

01:09:45.381 --> 01:09:48.383
I tried to do right by Billy.

01:09:49.652 --> 01:09:52.520
And now I'm going to pay.

01:09:55.658 --> 01:09:59.260
He's coming after me next,

01:09:59.262 --> 01:10:02.897
and I have no one left to protect me.

01:10:04.433 --> 01:10:08.203
I know after your father I said
I'd never ask you again,

01:10:08.205 --> 01:10:10.939
but please, Julian, just this once.

01:10:10.941 --> 01:10:14.776
Take care of this for me.

01:10:14.778 --> 01:10:17.879
Don't let them hurt me.

01:10:17.881 --> 01:10:21.683
Then we can get out of here.
We can go home.

01:10:22.618 --> 01:10:25.853
I can take care of you.

01:10:25.855 --> 01:10:28.856
I can be your mother again.

01:11:02.555 --> 01:11:05.351
- Be on guard.
- Yes, sir.

01:12:06.689 --> 01:12:09.590
Who's going to do the kid?

01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:14.729
We're just here for him.

01:12:15.764 --> 01:12:18.633
But that's not what she said.

01:12:27.943 --> 01:12:30.645
What did she say?

01:12:30.647 --> 01:12:33.815
She said to kill them all.

01:13:30.739 --> 01:13:34.008
I came here to collect my son's body.

01:13:34.010 --> 01:13:39.414
Now that it's been released,
my business here in Bangkok is done.

01:13:39.416 --> 01:13:43.551
I'm ready to go home.

01:13:43.553 --> 01:13:47.622
- When are you leaving?
- I was leaving tonight.

01:13:49.725 --> 01:13:53.928
And your other son? Is he going with you?

01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:57.432
What, Julian? Oh...

01:13:57.434 --> 01:14:02.470
I haven't had any real contact
with Julian since he left America.

01:14:04.606 --> 01:14:07.508
But you were there last night.

01:14:12.514 --> 01:14:14.749
Yeah.

01:14:16.084 --> 01:14:18.986
He's not much of a fighter.

01:14:59.495 --> 01:15:05.700
And it breaks my heart that Billy got
caught up in the scene here because of him.

01:15:09.137 --> 01:15:12.874
Billy was my first son.

01:15:12.876 --> 01:15:16.777
We had a very special relationship.

01:15:16.779 --> 01:15:21.182
Julian was so jealous.
It was like he was cracked or something.

01:15:21.184 --> 01:15:24.886
He had paranoid delusions about us.

01:15:26.088 --> 01:15:29.624
And it pains me to say this to you,

01:15:29.626 --> 01:15:33.594
as it would pain any mother,

01:15:33.596 --> 01:15:39.600
but he killed his own father with his bare hands.

01:15:39.602 --> 01:15:43.638
That's why he had to get out of America.

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:48.009
He's a very dangerous boy.

01:15:49.305 --> 01:15:55.880
