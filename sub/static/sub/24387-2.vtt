WEBVTT

00:04.200 --> 00:06.000
My name is Max William Easton.

00:06.033 --> 00:08.300
I'm a British
intelligence officer.

00:08.333 --> 00:10.967
You said it's done.
That whatever shady bullshit

00:11.000 --> 00:13.233
you were involved in
in London is over.

00:13.267 --> 00:15.367
Then you come running in
with a screwdriver

00:15.400 --> 00:17.767
and you lock your children
in the bathroom!

00:17.800 --> 00:19.433
Cooper and Toumi
have popped up in Beirut.

00:19.467 --> 00:21.333
We need you to go in
and clean up the mess.

00:21.367 --> 00:23.400
Find them. Deal with them.

00:23.433 --> 00:25.600
Find Said.
Deal with him as well.

00:25.633 --> 00:28.867
Ali Ardavan. Major financier of
the nuclear weapons program.

00:28.900 --> 00:30.200
Our next target.

00:33.567 --> 00:36.167
I found the source
of the breach.

00:36.200 --> 00:39.033
Burnett Hanson.
Ardavan was a client there.

00:39.067 --> 00:41.567
Harry is using Burnett Hanson
as a misdirect.

00:41.600 --> 00:43.567
Burnett Hanson
is not the breach.

00:43.600 --> 00:45.267
Harry is.

00:45.300 --> 00:49.033
SAID: How long have you been
passing intelligence to Tehran?
HARRY: What, are you joking?

00:49.067 --> 00:52.833
Where's Said
Why did he kill Harry?

00:52.867 --> 00:54.833
Said didn't kill Harry.

00:54.867 --> 00:57.533
Harry's here. In Beirut.

00:57.567 --> 00:59.200
Said, please!

00:59.233 --> 01:02.233
WHITE: We're giving you the
opportunity to make this right.

01:02.267 --> 01:04.133
Isn't that what you'd want?

01:05.200 --> 01:07.500
Why all of them?
Why not just Said?

01:07.533 --> 01:09.900
It's what Langley wants.

01:19.067 --> 01:21.700
Give me your hand.

01:21.733 --> 01:24.033
-Give me your fucking hand.

01:25.700 --> 01:27.300
Slumped.

01:27.333 --> 01:28.800
Two in the head.

01:31.100 --> 01:33.100
-Now get out of the car.

01:33.133 --> 01:36.367
You're gonna disappear...
for good.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.633
Anyone finds out you're alive,
we're both dead.

01:39.633 --> 01:43.367
I was doing my job
and now there's
a fucking kill order on me!

01:45.200 --> 01:46.900
Ohh...

01:48.000 --> 01:51.300
What did White tell you?
That I was the breach?

01:56.167 --> 02:00.467
What are they covering up,
Said

02:00.500 --> 02:03.233
Find your way across the border
to Ashgabat. Lose yourself.

02:03.267 --> 02:04.900
And you're just fine with this?

02:04.933 --> 02:07.433
Don't make me regret
not killing you, Harry.

02:17.500 --> 02:20.067
Said? Thank you.

03:14.133 --> 03:15.267
Yes?

03:15.300 --> 03:17.867
WHITE: We've had
a complication in Tehran.

03:17.900 --> 03:19.100
Care to expand?

03:19.133 --> 03:23.000
One of our team has done
some digging on Ardavan.

03:24.733 --> 03:26.733
He's followed the trail...

03:28.533 --> 03:31.300
..to Burnett Hanson.

03:31.333 --> 03:34.000
WOMAN: What?
-I've dealt with it.

03:34.033 --> 03:35.600
Dealt with it, how?

03:35.633 --> 03:37.333
He's down.

03:37.367 --> 03:38.833
"He"?

03:39.833 --> 03:41.633
Weren't there five of them
out there?

03:41.667 --> 03:44.367
-Yes.
-How do you know they haven't
talked to each other?

03:44.400 --> 03:47.367
How do you know he hasn't
shared what he found out?

03:47.400 --> 03:50.167
Are you willing
to take that risk, George...

03:51.667 --> 03:53.800
..stake your life on it?

03:56.000 --> 03:57.833
No, I didn't think so.

03:58.867 --> 04:00.900
They have to go.

04:01.967 --> 04:03.600
All of them.

04:05.767 --> 04:07.400
Do you have someone
who can clean up

04:07.433 --> 04:09.033
or do you want me
to send one of mine?

04:09.067 --> 04:11.700
No, no. I have someone.

04:11.733 --> 04:13.767
-He's--
-I don't need to know.

04:15.833 --> 04:18.533
Just make sure he's reliable
and you can control him.

04:38.167 --> 04:40.567
*

04:56.600 --> 05:00.033
MAN: You may find yourself
in another part of the world...

05:01.800 --> 05:04.100
..living in
a beautiful house...

05:05.100 --> 05:06.933
..with a beautiful wife...

05:09.433 --> 05:11.667
..and you may ask yourself

05:11.700 --> 05:14.033
"How do I work this?"

05:16.533 --> 05:18.733
"This is not
my beautiful house."

05:21.533 --> 05:23.300
"This is not
my beautiful wife."

05:27.267 --> 05:29.100
You may ask yourself

05:32.067 --> 05:33.767
"Well...

05:38.967 --> 05:40.733
..how did I get here?"

05:48.067 --> 05:49.933
Where's Harry

05:51.667 --> 05:54.100
-Cooper!

06:32.800 --> 06:34.367
-Aargh!

07:15.633 --> 07:17.500
My name is Max William Easton.

07:19.233 --> 07:21.467
I'm a British
Intelligence officer.

07:22.800 --> 07:24.533
-My last ass...

07:37.867 --> 07:40.733
-It's not a good time now.
-I just wanted
to hear your voice.

07:46.067 --> 07:48.733
You said you were
coming down with a cold.

07:48.767 --> 07:51.700
Erm...yeah,
it's... it's... it's fine.

07:51.733 --> 07:53.300
I'm fine.

07:53.333 --> 07:55.367
Well, you don't sound it.

07:56.767 --> 07:59.700
-Same as ever.

07:59.733 --> 08:01.733
You've been there before?

08:01.767 --> 08:03.500
Couple of times.

08:05.167 --> 08:07.533
It's neutral ground
for old clients.

08:11.367 --> 08:14.433
So did you find it

08:15.833 --> 08:18.500
-Soon. I promise.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.733
Anna, what's up?

08:24.833 --> 08:26.433
Nothing.

08:27.967 --> 08:30.367
I have to go.
Lola just came down.

08:30.400 --> 08:31.900
Oh, can you put her on?

08:37.300 --> 08:39.000
Lola?

08:41.667 --> 08:43.700
She went to the bathroom.

08:43.733 --> 08:45.933
I really have to go.

08:45.967 --> 08:47.767
Okay.

08:50.133 --> 08:51.600
I love you.

09:12.533 --> 09:16.800
My last assignment
was the assassination
of Dr. Marcus Reynolds -

09:16.833 --> 09:18.633
the British government
scientist.

09:33.733 --> 09:37.900
Four dead
Iranian nuclear scientists

09:37.933 --> 09:39.400
in the last two weeks.

09:39.433 --> 09:42.233
-Are you gonna tell me
this was the Israelis?
-No, sir.

09:42.267 --> 09:45.800
Since Stuxnet, we're more
careful which operations we
share with them. This was us.

09:45.833 --> 09:47.400
Sounds like mission creep.

09:47.433 --> 09:51.567
Our brief was to contain Iran's
nuclear weapons program--

09:51.600 --> 09:54.600
Your brief was to identify
and report back.

09:54.633 --> 09:56.567
The administration's
current approach

09:56.600 --> 09:59.600
is to safeguard
diplomatic stability with Iran.

09:59.633 --> 10:01.267
Perhaps you'd like
to enlighten me

10:01.300 --> 10:03.500
as to how
dead scientists turning up

10:03.533 --> 10:06.033
on the streets of Iran
is furthering that aim?

10:06.067 --> 10:07.933
Are we containing the regime,
or aren't we?

10:09.633 --> 10:11.100
Excuse me?

10:11.133 --> 10:14.433
I'm just not clear
what the objective is here,
Mr. Chairman.

10:15.400 --> 10:16.867
That makes two of us.

10:16.900 --> 10:20.367
You're supposed to be
gathering credible intelligence

10:20.400 --> 10:23.633
upon which this administration
can make an informed choice,

10:23.667 --> 10:26.800
not wreaking havoc
in the Iranian capital.

10:26.833 --> 10:28.933
We believed there to be
an active threat, sir.

10:28.967 --> 10:34.167
Let me ask you, do you think
the security of the Republic
should be underpinned

10:34.200 --> 10:36.833
by something
more than your belief?

10:37.967 --> 10:40.467
I'm minded to recommend
shutting this operation down.

10:40.500 --> 10:44.233
Isn't Cyber Command a more
effective way of achieving
our goals, in any case?

10:44.267 --> 10:46.867
With respect, Mr. Chairman,

10:47.733 --> 10:52.500
some of us believe in
good old-fashioned
analogue tradecraft.

10:52.533 --> 10:54.000
Boots on the ground.

10:56.167 --> 11:01.367
Okay. If you wish us
to support further operations,

11:01.400 --> 11:04.767
we need to move
beyond mere belief.

11:04.800 --> 11:09.133
Is Tehran in breach of
the nuclear deal, or isn't it?

11:09.167 --> 11:10.800
Cold hard facts,
not supposition,

11:10.833 --> 11:14.033
are what is required here,
Ms. Jones.

11:17.333 --> 11:19.100
JONES: Fucking suits.

11:19.133 --> 11:21.000
Why do you always
have to antagonize them?

11:21.033 --> 11:23.100
Do you think they would
talk to you like that?

11:23.133 --> 11:27.333
They're a bunch of corpulent,
flatulent misogynists, John.
Don't you dare defend them!

11:27.367 --> 11:29.400
You heard what he said.
Go get more evidence.

11:29.433 --> 11:31.633
Otherwise they're gonna
shut us down.

11:43.967 --> 11:45.900
Give me some good news.

11:45.933 --> 11:48.000
MAX: Cooper's off the table.

11:48.033 --> 11:51.500
I knew you still had it in you.
Leyla?

11:51.533 --> 11:54.467
She got picked up by police
in Petro Trad square.

11:54.500 --> 11:57.133
Okay. We'll find out which
station she's been taken to.

11:57.167 --> 11:59.700
I'll call the embassy and see
if we can get you in there.

11:59.733 --> 12:02.633
-Mm.

12:02.667 --> 12:05.533
I want Harry's body
repatriated.

12:07.400 --> 12:10.133
That might be tricky, Max.

12:10.167 --> 12:11.567
I'll do my best.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.433
Well, if anyone can do it,
you can.

12:13.467 --> 12:16.833
I think you've got
more faith in me than I have
in myself these days.

12:16.867 --> 12:18.967
Let's see how long that lasts.

12:22.300 --> 12:24.467
Finish the job, Max.

12:24.500 --> 12:27.767
And then go home, see your
family while you still can.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.433
MAX: Olivia,
if you're watching this,

12:48.467 --> 12:49.967
you'll know what to do with it.

12:55.767 --> 12:57.733
My name is Max William Easton.

13:05.300 --> 13:06.967
News on Toumi?

13:07.000 --> 13:09.433
Yes, we trawled police comms.

13:09.467 --> 13:13.167
Leyla Toumi is being detained
at Tareek El-Tafilah Station,

13:13.200 --> 13:14.700
the Mazraa quarter.

13:14.733 --> 13:16.633
WHITE: Alright,
let's get Max in there.

13:16.667 --> 13:18.900
I'll contact
his usual pickup point.

13:18.933 --> 13:21.700
I want everybody on this.
Where's Walker?

13:22.400 --> 13:25.600
I was under the command of
George White at The Section.

13:25.633 --> 13:26.733
MI6.

13:28.100 --> 13:30.933
Not disturbing you, am I?
We need you out here.

13:32.900 --> 13:34.733
What is it?

13:34.767 --> 13:37.233
Nothing. Nothing.

13:38.433 --> 13:40.500
Out here.

13:49.367 --> 13:52.933
Since the Omar tip-off,
Ardavan's stepped up
his security.

13:52.967 --> 13:56.100
He flies to Beirut the third
Sunday of every month.

14:02.700 --> 14:04.767
Hey, Said.

14:06.233 --> 14:08.567
Salam, chetori?

14:08.600 --> 14:10.800
Chetori? Salam.

14:21.200 --> 14:22.833
Harry's dead.

14:26.267 --> 14:29.800
London told us to pick up Omar,
interrogate him--

14:29.833 --> 14:32.100
-You're on Ardavan.

14:32.133 --> 14:36.000
-We still need to know.
-You need to know
what I decide to tell you.

14:39.600 --> 14:42.967
We drove to Omar's apartment
and we waited for him.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.733
Then he shows up and he walks
straight towards the car.

14:46.767 --> 14:48.767
Pulls a gun.

14:49.800 --> 14:53.567
And...shoots Harry in the head.

14:57.600 --> 14:59.300
I'm sorry.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.433
Alright, er...

15:04.400 --> 15:05.900
..did you get him?

15:07.167 --> 15:10.200
Said, answer the fucking
question! Did you get Omar?

15:11.233 --> 15:12.767
No. He got away.

15:12.800 --> 15:18.100
I got out, I chased him...
but he had his exit planned.

15:18.133 --> 15:20.667
-He's gone to ground.
-Well, then, we're screwed.

15:20.700 --> 15:22.267
No, not yet.

15:23.267 --> 15:25.000
We'll put the word out,
we'll find him.

15:27.967 --> 15:29.367
Where's the body?

15:30.767 --> 15:32.833
By the time
I returned to the car,

15:32.867 --> 15:34.900
police were crawling
all over the place.

15:34.933 --> 15:37.933
-I didn't have a choice.

15:37.967 --> 15:40.833
-I have to get it back.
-Leyla, he is gone!

15:40.867 --> 15:44.333
His body is lying on some
fucking Tehran police slab!

15:45.667 --> 15:48.800
Now, our orders are
we take out Omar and Ardavan

15:48.833 --> 15:50.900
and then we get out of here.

15:53.933 --> 15:56.467
Unless you're willing
to defy those orders?

16:14.767 --> 16:17.867
-I should never have
asked you to take--

16:18.833 --> 16:20.933
Spy on him?

16:22.100 --> 16:24.000
Yeah, it wasn't like that.

16:24.033 --> 16:25.500
Yeah?

16:26.533 --> 16:28.700
So what was it like?

16:29.833 --> 16:31.567
Why the constant questions?

16:31.600 --> 16:35.033
-He was here because of me.

16:35.067 --> 16:38.600
His father and I,
we were friends,
and he walked out on him.

16:38.633 --> 16:41.600
And you were
a good substitute, huh?

16:43.600 --> 16:45.133
Apparently not.

16:47.233 --> 16:49.933
I should have been there.

16:50.733 --> 16:52.733
-This is not on you.
-No. No.

16:54.400 --> 16:55.800
It's on you.

16:55.833 --> 16:58.500
This whole fucking shambles
is on you.

17:00.667 --> 17:02.567
-Leyla, if...
-Get...

17:06.567 --> 17:08.700
Let's get this over with. Hm?

17:10.700 --> 17:12.700
And then I'm out.

17:13.900 --> 17:16.733
And I never have to
look at you again.

18:00.833 --> 18:01.933
Ah.

19:26.467 --> 19:29.167
Said turned on him.
He killed him.

19:53.900 --> 19:55.000
Shukran.

20:08.733 --> 20:10.767
As-Salamu Alaykum.

20:10.800 --> 20:12.167
Alaykumu As-Salam.

20:12.200 --> 20:14.967
Henry Adams.
Attaché to the British Embassy.

20:16.467 --> 20:20.233
I'm here to collect Leyla
Toumi. Can I speak to your
commanding officer, please?

20:21.233 --> 20:23.967
-Yeah, have a seat.
-Thank you.

20:48.533 --> 20:50.033
Sir.

20:50.067 --> 20:52.600
I'm sorry, but there is
no one here by that name.

20:53.600 --> 20:56.167
-She's here.
I know she's here.
-No, sir, she's not.

20:56.200 --> 20:59.967
-I literally just saw her--
-No...sir...you did not.

21:31.833 --> 21:34.200
She switched custody.
Handed over to the ISF.

21:34.233 --> 21:37.567
You know what that means:
Salim Baraket.

21:42.400 --> 21:46.467
Baraket's no longer head of the
ISF. He's semi-retired. They're
phasing out the old guard.

21:46.500 --> 21:48.767
Except we never do
fucking retire, do we, George?

21:49.733 --> 21:53.033
Baraket told me never to
set foot in Beirut again.

21:53.067 --> 21:55.467
He knows I'm in town,
must have his dogs on me.

21:55.500 --> 21:57.267
But now Baraket's got bait,

21:57.300 --> 22:00.133
all he has to do is sit back
and wait for me to come to him.

22:00.167 --> 22:02.233
That's a bad idea, Max.

22:02.267 --> 22:05.667
You walk in there,
with your history, you know
exactly what will happen.

22:05.700 --> 22:07.333
Why, you got a better move?

22:07.367 --> 22:10.767
Raid the vaults.
Find me something on him.

22:10.800 --> 22:13.533
Make it good if you want me
to walk out again.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.767
My name is Max William Easton.

25:10.767 --> 25:12.467
I'm a British
Intelligence officer.

25:12.500 --> 25:14.233
My last assignment was

25:14.267 --> 25:16.633
the assassination of
Dr. Marcus Reynolds,

25:16.667 --> 25:18.867
the British
government scientist

25:18.900 --> 25:21.100
and UN weapons inspector...

25:37.533 --> 25:39.967
She just played the tape
for her brother.

25:41.733 --> 25:44.467
What's the order?
Did you speak to White yet?

25:44.500 --> 25:46.700
Just sit tight.
I'll call you back.

25:58.967 --> 26:03.233
So we are looking into
some compromising intel
on Baraket from 2005.

26:06.367 --> 26:08.867
Did you find anything on
Baraket, anything we can use?

26:08.900 --> 26:10.467
Uh...

26:10.500 --> 26:12.900
Good God, man, please tell me
you have something.

26:12.933 --> 26:14.500
What the hell
have you been doing?

26:18.300 --> 26:20.867
I'll get onto it right away,
sir.

26:20.900 --> 26:23.133
-Sorry.

26:35.433 --> 26:37.867
I spoke to White.
This needs to be contained.

26:37.900 --> 26:41.233
You're gonna need
a strong stomach for this one.

26:45.467 --> 26:47.467
Nothing left behind.

26:54.633 --> 26:58.567
For what it's worth,
I don't think Dr. Reynolds
deserved to die...

26:59.667 --> 27:01.600
..if anyone ever does.

28:44.067 --> 28:46.200
Max, Max, Max.

28:48.533 --> 28:50.833
What are you doing here, Max?

28:50.867 --> 28:53.467
I told you what would happen
if you ever came back.

28:53.500 --> 28:58.300
The ISF's holding one of ours -
a British national, an asset.

28:58.333 --> 28:59.933
The Section wants her back.

29:02.700 --> 29:05.833
-We both know you took her.

29:05.867 --> 29:09.700
How much
are they prepared to pay?

29:11.167 --> 29:13.167
Nothing.

29:14.833 --> 29:16.300
Argh!

29:38.467 --> 29:41.300
I warned you what would happen
if you returned.

29:42.300 --> 29:44.700
If this was about me,
why did you take our asset?

29:44.733 --> 29:47.800
Well, if you're after her,
means she's valuable.

29:48.833 --> 29:52.500
A man's got a right
to make a living. Hm?

29:54.100 --> 29:55.700
So...

29:57.067 --> 30:00.000
..fish hooks, shark line,
gutting knives.

30:00.033 --> 30:03.067
No reason we should
make this quick, right?

30:03.100 --> 30:05.967
-I have a confession.
-I'm not a priest.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.867
Left jacket pocket.

30:17.200 --> 30:19.033
When I was stationed here,
I have to say,

30:19.067 --> 30:20.800
you were a generous host.

30:20.833 --> 30:22.733
You gave me access
to your work,

30:22.767 --> 30:24.233
maybe more than you knew.

30:25.700 --> 30:27.600
Ah.

30:27.633 --> 30:29.733
Long time ago.

30:29.767 --> 30:32.067
-Memory fades.
-Records remain.

30:32.100 --> 30:35.800
21st July, 2005.
The government
motorcade bombing.

30:35.833 --> 30:38.800
Twenty people died,
including your Prime Minister.

30:38.833 --> 30:41.267
Everyone pointed the finger
at Syria.

30:42.800 --> 30:46.367
But you and I both know...
that couldn't have happened

30:46.400 --> 30:48.300
without information
from insiders,

30:48.333 --> 30:50.533
high up in
Lebanese intelligence.

30:52.033 --> 30:55.367
What some people might call...
traitors.

30:57.733 --> 31:00.133
The code is 1834. Take a look.

31:04.867 --> 31:06.833
If the communiqués
don't bury you,

31:06.867 --> 31:11.267
the Damascus meeting with
Syrian intelligence two days
before the bomb certainly will.

31:15.300 --> 31:17.600
If I don't
get out of here alive,

31:17.633 --> 31:19.700
all of that gets leaked.

31:20.733 --> 31:22.433
It's just a click of a button.

31:24.733 --> 31:26.800
You once told me,
if you had to run,

31:26.833 --> 31:29.300
you'd seek sanctuary in Syria.
Is that right?

31:31.200 --> 31:34.300
Well, that doesn't seem like
such a safe haven now.

31:35.433 --> 31:38.500
You're gonna take me
to Leyla Toumi.

31:49.800 --> 31:52.167
It'll be returned to you
when you leave.

32:20.867 --> 32:22.733
Sit down.

32:25.333 --> 32:27.867
This man is here
to collect you. You are to be

32:27.900 --> 32:30.700
released into his custody
and escorted back to the UK.

32:30.733 --> 32:32.667
-Yeah.

32:33.733 --> 32:35.700
This man is here to kill me.

32:37.233 --> 32:40.033
Leave me alone with him
and you'll be testifying

32:40.067 --> 32:43.900
as to why a British citizen
was murdered on your watch.

32:44.967 --> 32:47.067
I need to talk to you
about Harry.

32:47.100 --> 32:50.233
Say what you like, I'm not
going anywhere with you.

32:50.267 --> 32:52.767
"Love is a kind of warfare."

32:55.000 --> 32:56.533
Your ring.

32:58.533 --> 33:00.400
It's written on the inside.

33:00.433 --> 33:04.000
It's Ovid. I know because
I had it engraved there.

33:06.433 --> 33:08.467
I'm his father.

33:11.133 --> 33:13.200
Would you give us a moment?

33:29.567 --> 33:31.033
He obviously gave it to you.

33:31.067 --> 33:33.767
His mother gave it to him.
And I gave it to her.

33:33.800 --> 33:36.033
Long time ago.

33:39.900 --> 33:41.400
So, take it back.

33:41.433 --> 33:43.967
You're about to be processed
by the Ministry of the Int--

33:44.000 --> 33:46.600
I heard what happened
to Cooper.

33:46.633 --> 33:48.467
Your doing?

33:52.767 --> 33:54.967
So, who sent you?

33:55.000 --> 33:56.500
White?

34:04.533 --> 34:06.400
And you're to do
the same for me?

34:07.933 --> 34:09.133
Maybe.

34:10.167 --> 34:12.367
Or maybe things have changed.

34:13.933 --> 34:15.900
White told me Harry was dead.

34:15.933 --> 34:19.733
-Cooper told me he was alive.
-A dying man will say anything.

34:22.033 --> 34:23.833
Is he alive?

34:26.467 --> 34:30.133
I have every reason to tell you
what you want to hear -

34:30.167 --> 34:31.900
it keeps me breathing.

34:31.933 --> 34:34.967
But how can you know
I'm telling you the truth?

34:39.000 --> 34:41.433
-Harry said you were dead.
-Yet here I am.

34:42.767 --> 34:46.167
So, you might not be
who you say you are.

34:46.200 --> 34:48.667
I guess you'll just have to
take that chance.

34:48.700 --> 34:51.533
Because I suspect, like me,

34:51.567 --> 34:53.333
you want answers too.

34:55.367 --> 34:56.933
And because
maybe you love him too.

34:58.967 --> 35:03.467
Leyla, you're on a list
no one has ever survived.

35:03.500 --> 35:05.700
I am your one chance
to get off it.

35:05.733 --> 35:08.833
Now, you can either trust me,
come with me,

35:08.867 --> 35:11.933
or you trust them
and you stay here.

35:14.200 --> 35:15.533
Your choice.

35:41.367 --> 35:42.967
I'll be seeing you, Max.

35:50.500 --> 35:52.633
Now, White told me
you all mutinied,

35:52.667 --> 35:55.067
you all turned on each other.

35:55.100 --> 35:57.867
That Said killed Harry.
Or had him killed.

35:57.900 --> 36:00.267
-That's not what happened.

36:02.967 --> 36:06.000
I don't know. The only thing
I'm absolutely certain of,

36:06.033 --> 36:08.367
is what's gonna happen
if you don't.

36:15.333 --> 36:17.400
What happened in Tehran, Leyla?

36:34.800 --> 36:37.400
COOPER: You with me, honey?

36:37.433 --> 36:39.633
LEYLA: Two blocks away.
-Fifty meters.

36:40.633 --> 36:43.033
Omar's cab is passing me now.

36:50.667 --> 36:53.233
-Lost him.
-I'm on it.

37:11.100 --> 37:12.967
Why am I on the kill list?

37:13.000 --> 37:14.167
What?

37:19.133 --> 37:21.833
-I don't know, I swear!

37:21.867 --> 37:23.700
I went there to warn him.

37:23.733 --> 37:25.567
He was never supposed to be
on the list.

37:26.600 --> 37:28.333
But he was financing
the program.

37:28.367 --> 37:30.467
That's what they told you.

37:31.600 --> 37:34.700
-Speak to Ardavan. He knows.

37:34.733 --> 37:37.033
-What they're really doing
out here.

37:37.067 --> 37:38.633
What you're really doing!

37:46.000 --> 37:47.533
So where's Ardavan now?

37:47.567 --> 37:50.433
I don't know.
I got him a passport.

37:57.833 --> 37:59.167
And the name on the passport?

37:59.200 --> 38:03.733
-Er... Darius... Darius Kazim!

38:11.800 --> 38:13.900
We need to move!

38:47.567 --> 38:49.667
So he is alive.

38:50.667 --> 38:52.933
Where is he now?

38:52.967 --> 38:54.733
He's after a man
called Ali Ardavan.

38:54.767 --> 38:57.300
-I know how to find him.

38:57.333 --> 38:59.267
-Ardavan was on our list.

38:59.300 --> 39:03.067
When Harry started
looking into him, he ended up
with an order on himself.

39:04.067 --> 39:07.000
-The Section ordered
Harry dead?
-White.

39:07.033 --> 39:08.833
Said couldn't carry it out.

39:09.867 --> 39:12.967
-No. Said lied to him.
Took off.

39:14.433 --> 39:16.733
If we find Ardavan,
we find Harry.

39:29.567 --> 39:32.200
Will Daddy be home on Saturday?

39:32.233 --> 39:34.867
I want him to take me
to the climbing wall.

39:37.267 --> 39:39.067
He always takes me.

39:40.500 --> 39:42.800
-Promis.

40:28.633 --> 40:30.300
-Maman.

40:42.733 --> 40:44.267
Walker...

41:17.900 --> 41:19.167
Ssh. C'était un rêve.

41:42.633 --> 41:44.867
Allez, viens.
Shh-shh.

41:44.900 --> 41:46.200
Viens avec moi. On y va.

41:49.967 --> 41:52.167
I never sanctioned an op
in St. Michel.

41:52.200 --> 41:53.900
I know you've got
an asset in play.

41:53.933 --> 41:55.433
You start talking!

41:55.467 --> 41:58.300
-She knows everything.

41:58.333 --> 42:01.667
The wife. Max made a tape,
an insurance policy,
about the Reynolds hit.

42:01.700 --> 42:03.233
He named you.
The wife watched it.

42:03.267 --> 42:05.233
-I was doing you a favor.

42:05.267 --> 42:07.900
-Wet work.

42:07.933 --> 42:09.800
I sent Laurence in.

42:10.967 --> 42:13.500
-You treacherous little prick.
-Because you keep me blind.

42:13.533 --> 42:16.367
You always have, standing on
my fucking shoulders!

42:19.567 --> 42:22.133
You're finished.
Get out of my sight.

42:24.333 --> 42:25.667
Maman?

42:34.033 --> 42:35.700
Laurence, this is George White.

42:37.767 --> 42:40.033
Show's over. Abort.
I repeat, abort.

43:15.333 --> 43:17.867
Who's furthest? Oh, no.

43:42.867 --> 43:47.267
I've come to recognize
the sound of a single malt
being poured 3,000 miles away.

43:50.367 --> 43:54.000
I reactivated an old asset to
sort out this fiasco in Tehran.

43:56.533 --> 43:58.367
I thought I had enough
leverage on him

43:58.400 --> 44:00.800
and it turns out
he has the same on me.

44:03.133 --> 44:05.700
On us, actually.

44:05.733 --> 44:06.933
Go on.

44:06.967 --> 44:09.133
The Marcus Reynolds job.

44:10.667 --> 44:13.100
Tell me you have
this ring-fenced.

44:13.133 --> 44:15.067
He made a confession, of sorts.

44:16.067 --> 44:18.800
-It's a tape.
-Christ!

44:18.833 --> 44:21.667
His wife has seen it.
So has her brother.

44:24.267 --> 44:26.100
But they are contained?

44:26.133 --> 44:29.167
Walker acted rashly,
without my authorization.

44:29.200 --> 44:30.800
She got spooked.

44:31.767 --> 44:32.933
She fled.

44:32.967 --> 44:35.467
-I'm getting on a plane.
-No. You don't have to do that.

44:35.500 --> 44:37.533
If this spreads,
I burn right along with you,

44:37.567 --> 44:41.200
so forgive me if I don't trust
you to deal with it alone.

44:54.000 --> 44:55.233
