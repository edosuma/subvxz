00:25.809 --> 00:28.844
And now, in a breaking
story, two sisters,

00:28.846 --> 00:31.980
Emily and Sara Rodriguez,
were reported missing

00:31.982 --> 00:34.816
while filming a documentary
about spiritual mediums.

00:34.818 --> 00:37.019
College administrators
and local authorities

00:37.021 --> 00:38.854
are combing through
their social media pages

00:38.856 --> 00:41.323
for clues as to their
disappearance.

00:41.325 --> 00:42.791
But at the moment, no one knows

00:42.793 --> 00:44.526
what happened to the two
sisters.

00:46.864 --> 00:48.730
We reached out to Paul Shipman,

00:48.732 --> 00:50.699
one of the mediums the girls
interviewed.

00:50.701 --> 00:52.701
Here's what he had to say.

00:53.704 --> 00:55.304
How do you know Emily and Sara?

00:56.940 --> 01:01.810
I first met Emily and
Sara when they contacted me

01:01.812 --> 01:04.346
to come over and do a
reading in their house.

01:06.350 --> 01:08.350
Can you describe
what you do for a living?

01:09.687 --> 01:11.520
Well, what I really do for a
living

01:11.522 --> 01:15.791
is I use my gift to help people.

01:16.994 --> 01:18.560
Can you tell
us about your gift?

01:20.531 --> 01:22.364
Me seeing things,

01:23.934 --> 01:29.004
it may be a gift, but it's also
a curse.

01:30.574 --> 01:35.677
And for me to convey my readings

01:35.679 --> 01:38.046
to people and have them react,

01:38.048 --> 01:40.349
whether it be positive or
negative,

01:44.521 --> 01:48.657
it's really the hardest part of
what I do,

01:48.659 --> 01:52.594
and I see a lot of tragedy.

02:03.741 --> 02:05.640
All right, Lucas, you owe me
one.

02:09.813 --> 02:13.782
Hey, what are you
doin'?

02:13.784 --> 02:15.617
Just needed to go for a walk.

02:15.619 --> 02:17.085
- You all right?
- Mm-hmm.

02:17.087 --> 02:17.953
What about you?

02:17.955 --> 02:19.087
I'm good.

02:19.089 --> 02:20.856
- Okay.
- I'm good.

02:20.858 --> 02:22.124
- Good.
- I'm really good, actually.

02:22.126 --> 02:22.691
Mm-hmm.

02:26.997 --> 02:29.830
Wait, what are you doing?

02:29.832 --> 02:32.666
Sara, this has been the
best three years of my life.

02:42.479 --> 02:45.013
What do you say?

02:49.019 --> 02:54.089
Lucas.

02:54.925 --> 02:56.191
You're always gonna be gone.

02:58.061 --> 03:00.662
I'm always gonna be worried
about you.

03:00.664 --> 03:01.897
Oh, shit.

03:05.602 --> 03:08.870
- What are you saying?
- I can't.

03:08.872 --> 03:10.772
I can't be a military wife.

03:10.774 --> 03:11.907
It isn't me.

03:11.909 --> 03:13.175
I'd be miserable.

03:26.790 --> 03:27.856
I'm sorry.

03:44.241 --> 03:45.106
All right.

03:47.678 --> 03:50.111
Hi, I'm Emily.

03:50.113 --> 03:51.580
This is my college final.

03:52.549 --> 03:53.815
Dude, what the hell?

03:53.817 --> 03:54.850
What are you doing?

03:54.852 --> 03:56.117
The little intro.

03:56.119 --> 03:58.854
You know how
important this is to me.

03:58.856 --> 03:59.921
Oh my god, okay.

04:00.991 --> 04:02.057
Whatever.

04:07.598 --> 04:09.498
Hey, I'm Emily.

04:09.500 --> 04:11.600
And I'm her sister, Sara.

04:11.602 --> 04:13.201
Emily's documentary project is
about...

04:13.203 --> 04:14.569
It's about spiritual mediums,

04:14.571 --> 04:17.606
so I've titled it Dead Voices.

04:17.608 --> 04:18.940
Not creepy at all.

04:18.942 --> 04:21.610
Mediumship is the
practice

04:21.612 --> 04:24.045
of mediating communication
between spirits

04:24.047 --> 04:26.948
of the dead and of living
people.

04:26.950 --> 04:29.751
Practitioners are known as
mediums.

04:29.753 --> 04:32.287
I lost my ex-boyfriend Lucas

04:32.289 --> 04:35.824
a little over a year
ago to the war in Iraq.

04:35.826 --> 04:37.759
He was in Special Forces.

04:37.761 --> 04:41.096
Right, his body was never
found, but his death was assumed

04:41.098 --> 04:43.164
after other men in his
platoon were found dead.

04:44.234 --> 04:46.034
I wanna find out what happened
to Lucas

04:46.036 --> 04:50.205
by getting into contact with
him or someone he was with.

04:50.207 --> 04:54.042
Yeah, and I agreed to help
as long as I get to film it.

04:54.044 --> 04:55.844
We've been reaching out to try
to find

04:55.846 --> 04:57.112
a legit medium that can help
us...

04:57.114 --> 04:58.813
Yeah, we posted ads on the
web,

04:58.815 --> 05:01.216
social media, no luck so far.

05:05.155 --> 05:07.756
Oh, oh, okay, that should be
good for now.

05:09.026 --> 05:10.892
Are you gonna quit cutting me
off

05:10.894 --> 05:12.761
or is this how it's gonna
be for the whole shoot?

05:12.763 --> 05:13.562
Cutting you off?

05:13.564 --> 05:14.663
What do you mean?

05:14.665 --> 05:15.297
I'm just finishing your
sentence.

05:15.299 --> 05:16.164
Shut up.

05:17.734 --> 05:21.136
Okay, sisters' fun time over.

05:25.075 --> 05:27.642
Okay.

05:27.644 --> 05:30.211
Hey, um, you okay?

05:30.213 --> 05:31.146
It's been kinda quiet.

05:32.749 --> 05:34.849
Did you take your meds today?

05:36.653 --> 05:37.285
Oh my god.

05:37.287 --> 05:38.987
Get out of my room.

05:39.823 --> 05:43.024
Mm, this explains a lot.

05:44.127 --> 05:47.596
Gotta call Dr. Feelgood, oh my
god.

05:47.598 --> 05:48.897
I literally just ran out.

05:48.899 --> 05:50.198
Don't keep tabs on me.

05:50.200 --> 05:51.932
I can handle my stuff.

05:51.934 --> 05:53.667
Yeah, we can all see
that.

05:55.872 --> 05:57.706
Why do you have the camera on?

05:57.708 --> 05:59.040
Um, this
project

05:59.042 --> 06:01.042
is due in a week, Sara, okay?

06:01.044 --> 06:04.079
The project is happening fast.

06:04.081 --> 06:06.815
The camera stays on.

06:06.817 --> 06:07.882
Shut up.

06:09.319 --> 06:12.020
Well, I kinda wanted
to do that, you know,

06:12.022 --> 06:13.989
thing where we interview each
other

06:13.991 --> 06:19.060
and ask questions about things
and bubble gum, cherry pop.

06:19.062 --> 06:23.865
You're not listening at all,
so what are you lookin' at?

06:23.867 --> 06:25.634
Oh!

06:25.636 --> 06:28.136
Okay, he kinda looks cool.

06:28.138 --> 06:29.904
Yeah, I feel really good about
him.

06:31.041 --> 06:33.174
Okay, well, do you want me to
call him?

06:34.911 --> 06:36.778
Yeah, all his testimonials say

06:36.780 --> 06:38.813
he's the best medium in
California.

06:40.417 --> 06:42.217
All right, we'll give him a
shot,

06:43.286 --> 06:46.321
but let's go on this first,
yeah?

06:50.027 --> 06:51.092
Yeah?

06:52.863 --> 06:54.129
Okay, fine.

06:54.131 --> 06:55.763
Okay, good.

06:55.765 --> 06:57.398
All right, hey, so what
do you want me to ask you?

06:59.436 --> 07:01.736
Why my sister is an idiot.

07:01.738 --> 07:04.039
Okay, dang.

07:04.041 --> 07:08.043
Um, all right, why don't you
talk

07:08.045 --> 07:10.211
about Lucas a little bit more?

07:10.213 --> 07:11.980
- Why?
- I don't know.

07:11.982 --> 07:15.917
Maybe because he is the reason
we're doing the project.

07:15.919 --> 07:17.352
You're right.

07:17.354 --> 07:20.388
Yeah, I'm always
pretty much right, so...

07:24.828 --> 07:26.394
I think our government should

07:26.396 --> 07:28.096
take better care of our troops.

07:31.368 --> 07:34.402
I mean, how the hell do you
lose someone's body like that?

07:35.305 --> 07:37.405
Wow, straight for the
jugular.

07:38.809 --> 07:40.775
I should have taken
better care of him, too.

07:42.145 --> 07:43.478
Sometimes I wish I could go
back.

07:47.250 --> 07:49.184
I have to find out what happened
to him.

07:50.420 --> 07:53.154
You broke up with
him for the right reasons.

07:55.892 --> 07:57.025
I don't know if I did.

07:58.462 --> 08:01.296
I think Taylor
would disagree, strongly.

08:11.074 --> 08:12.307
Holy shit, that must be him!

08:13.844 --> 08:15.076
Coming!

08:17.447 --> 08:18.313
Hi!

08:19.282 --> 08:20.882
Hi, I'm Paul.

08:20.884 --> 08:24.452
- Sara.
- Is your mom or dad home?

08:24.454 --> 08:25.854
Oh, we called you.

08:25.856 --> 08:26.788
This is Emily.

08:26.790 --> 08:27.989
Hi.

08:27.991 --> 08:30.058
Wait a minute, are you
recording this?

08:30.060 --> 08:33.061
No, no, yeah,
no, no, we're not, yeah.

08:33.063 --> 08:35.130
Okay, well, then what's with
the camera?

08:37.000 --> 08:39.367
We're part-time models.

08:39.369 --> 08:43.104
Hey guys, we are with the
world-famous medium.

08:43.106 --> 08:46.007
Understand, can we maybe just
stop...

08:46.009 --> 08:47.108
Oh, well, you should follow
us.

08:47.110 --> 08:48.843
Our handle's @deadvoicesmovie.

08:48.845 --> 08:50.078
I just put you on our story.

08:50.080 --> 08:51.813
Okay, you lost me at story,
so.

08:51.815 --> 08:53.414
Oh, sorry.

08:53.416 --> 08:56.050
Okay, fine, whatever, can we
begin?

08:56.853 --> 08:57.919
Sure!

09:05.162 --> 09:07.395
I must rest my eyes to
connect to the other side.

09:10.233 --> 09:11.933
In case anyone wants to
follow.

09:11.935 --> 09:14.803
I feel...

09:19.042 --> 09:20.208
I feel a presence.

09:22.979 --> 09:24.112
Sorry!

09:25.115 --> 09:26.548
God, what did I miss?

09:26.550 --> 09:27.382
Shh.

09:28.585 --> 09:32.053
This, this presence

09:34.291 --> 09:35.356
or figure,

09:43.200 --> 09:44.399
it wants me to warn you both.

09:46.203 --> 09:47.268
Do you understand?

09:48.271 --> 09:49.270
No.

09:49.272 --> 09:50.338
No.

09:51.274 --> 09:52.841
He or she, it...

09:59.282 --> 10:02.984
It keeps screaming, "Don't let
them go.

10:05.021 --> 10:06.955
"Don't let them go."

10:06.957 --> 10:10.358
Do you understand?

10:10.360 --> 10:13.595
We got no idea what
you're talkin' about.

10:21.004 --> 10:22.303
Are you okay?

10:25.275 --> 10:27.942
Don't, don't, don't go, don't
go!

10:28.912 --> 10:32.046
- Hey!
- Ah!

10:39.890 --> 10:40.555
I need to leave.

10:41.625 --> 10:42.624
What?

10:42.626 --> 10:43.491
No, wait!

10:44.628 --> 10:45.994
Uh.

10:45.996 --> 10:47.462
Oh my god.

10:47.464 --> 10:49.163
Okay, you know what?

10:49.165 --> 10:50.131
That's the last time we're
calling

10:50.133 --> 10:52.200
someone off a random website.

10:52.202 --> 10:54.068
What do you think he was
talking about?

10:54.070 --> 10:56.905
Come on, you don't think
that guy was legit, do you?

10:56.907 --> 10:58.139
Uh, what?

10:58.141 --> 10:59.374
I almost pissed my pants 'cause
of that.

10:59.376 --> 11:01.175
Oh, please, that was

11:01.177 --> 11:04.012
the most generic psychic
show I've ever seen.

11:04.014 --> 11:05.513
I don't know, I felt
something.

11:06.983 --> 11:10.184
Well, he's gone, so
let's find someone else.

11:38.548 --> 11:39.647
Em?

11:51.294 --> 11:52.560
You're freaking kidding me?

11:53.964 --> 11:55.029
Emily!

12:19.522 --> 12:21.089
I'm gonna break your stupid
camera.

12:35.105 --> 12:37.338
Okay, hey, you ready?

12:38.541 --> 12:40.441
Do I really
have to do this part?

12:40.443 --> 12:41.743
Come on, what do you
wanna do?

12:41.745 --> 12:44.245
You're gonna do all this

12:44.247 --> 12:46.147
and I can delete all my stuff,
all right?

12:47.317 --> 12:48.383
Okay.

12:52.322 --> 12:53.688
Um, okay, all right,
you're set.

12:53.690 --> 12:55.023
You owe me one.

12:59.195 --> 13:03.097
Hey, what are you
doin'?

13:03.099 --> 13:04.732
Just needed to go for a walk.

13:04.734 --> 13:06.234
- You all right?
- Mm-hmm.

13:06.236 --> 13:07.268
What about you?

13:07.270 --> 13:08.336
I'm good.

13:08.338 --> 13:09.604
- Okay.
- I'm good.

13:09.606 --> 13:11.372
- Good.
- I'm really good, actually.

13:11.374 --> 13:12.440
Mm-hmm.

13:16.312 --> 13:18.979
Wait, what are you doing?

13:18.981 --> 13:21.649
Sara, this has been the
best three years of my life.

13:29.325 --> 13:30.340
Oh.

13:30.342 --> 13:31.358
Hey, baby, how's it goin'?

13:31.361 --> 13:32.360
Not bad, just helping Emily.

13:36.199 --> 13:37.498
I think I found our medium.

13:39.235 --> 13:40.768
He looks like a Mormon.

13:40.770 --> 13:42.103
Mormons can be psychic.

13:43.573 --> 13:46.274
Plus, he DMed me and followed
me so let's give him a chance.

13:46.276 --> 13:47.809
Wow, that's really
great.

13:47.811 --> 13:51.079
You're turning your project
into a dating service.

13:51.081 --> 13:52.280
Could you take this a little
more serious,

13:52.282 --> 13:55.149
like just for a day?

13:55.151 --> 13:58.653
Excuse me, do you not see
all this legit gear I bought?

13:58.655 --> 14:02.457
Okay, this is just for the
project, so it's pretty serious.

14:02.459 --> 14:04.859
Yeah, real legit,
wow, looks real legit.

14:04.861 --> 14:06.594
Shut up.

14:06.596 --> 14:07.628
I can't understand you
sometimes.

14:11.868 --> 14:13.468
That's him.

14:13.470 --> 14:15.269
You called him already?

14:15.271 --> 14:16.337
Yeah.

14:19.542 --> 14:20.608
Hello?

14:20.610 --> 14:21.709
You're such a slut.

14:21.711 --> 14:22.777
Shut up.

14:23.480 --> 14:25.613
Oh no, yeah, yeah.

14:25.615 --> 14:29.150
Great, okay, all right, sorry,
one sec.

14:29.152 --> 14:31.819
And Steadicam is in the house.

14:31.821 --> 14:33.488
When does it get steady?

14:33.490 --> 14:34.822
Oh my god,
shut up.

14:34.824 --> 14:36.190
Okay, shh.

14:36.192 --> 14:37.391
Okay, go, go!

14:37.393 --> 14:41.229
Our subject is here,

14:41.231 --> 14:43.764
and we will begin the
interview process now.

14:45.235 --> 14:47.235
Great, okay, let's go.

14:47.237 --> 14:49.303
All right, oh shit!

14:49.305 --> 14:51.405
- Ooh!
- Oh my god, okay, I'm good.

14:51.407 --> 14:52.573
I read the manual, I read the
manual.

14:52.575 --> 14:54.358
Don't worry about it.

14:54.360 --> 14:56.144
Okay, Sara, can you get the
door?

14:56.146 --> 14:57.712
Okay, all right.

14:57.714 --> 14:59.680
Hi, one second,

14:59.682 --> 15:02.316
I'm just on a learning
curve thing here, okay.

15:02.318 --> 15:03.718
You must be Emily.

15:03.720 --> 15:06.387
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
hi, oh, I'm sorry, sorry.

15:06.389 --> 15:07.488
Funny accident, don't ask.

15:07.490 --> 15:08.422
Oh, yeah.

15:08.424 --> 15:09.357
Nice rig.

15:09.359 --> 15:11.392
Thanks.

15:11.394 --> 15:12.593
I'm Sara.

15:12.595 --> 15:13.895
- Nice to meet you.
- It's my sister.

15:13.897 --> 15:15.830
Um, you come in, yeah.

15:15.832 --> 15:20.368
The living room is right
through here.

15:20.370 --> 15:22.770
Okay, let's give it a shot
then.

15:25.241 --> 15:28.176
Since we're recording
this, can you both confirm

15:28.178 --> 15:30.645
I know nothing about your
lives or anyone in your lives?

15:30.647 --> 15:31.712
- Yes.
- Yeah.

15:38.788 --> 15:42.456
Okay, I hear quite a
few voices speaking now.

15:44.827 --> 15:49.897
Something about, something
about Oktoberfest.

15:51.868 --> 15:52.967
Does that make any sense?

15:53.970 --> 15:55.236
No.

15:55.905 --> 15:58.873
Um, I think maybe it does.

16:04.380 --> 16:05.846
A group of guys

16:09.485 --> 16:13.521
talking about Oktoberfest in
Germany.

16:16.259 --> 16:18.726
They can't wait to go.

16:20.496 --> 16:23.397
This has meaning, Sara?

16:23.399 --> 16:25.600
Uh, yeah, my boyfriend

16:25.602 --> 16:27.735
was stationed in Germany for a
while.

16:27.737 --> 16:28.936
Okay, hold on.

16:28.938 --> 16:30.271
Sara, come here.

16:31.708 --> 16:36.277
I'm getting more.

16:36.279 --> 16:40.248
A name, it starts with a D.

16:40.250 --> 16:41.816
Don?

16:41.818 --> 16:43.484
Doug?

16:43.486 --> 16:44.685
I don't know.

16:44.687 --> 16:46.954
No, it's not.

16:48.258 --> 16:51.792
Dan, no.

16:53.329 --> 16:56.697
David, Dave.

16:56.699 --> 16:57.732
I hear the name Dave.

16:57.734 --> 17:00.935
He's trying to speak now.

17:00.937 --> 17:03.404
Do you know the name Dave?

17:03.406 --> 17:05.339
Um, yeah.

17:08.344 --> 17:10.945
Dave says he was good
friends with Lucas.

17:12.315 --> 17:14.382
Oh shit, the battery!

17:14.384 --> 17:17.018
Was Lucas your boyfriend?

17:21.024 --> 17:23.424
Okay, okay, go on.

17:24.527 --> 17:26.894
Okay, Sara, stay with me.

17:28.331 --> 17:30.031
Dave has something important to
tell you.

17:32.001 --> 17:33.401
Oh, he talks fast.

17:33.403 --> 17:35.970
Hmm, yeah, he always did.

17:38.708 --> 17:42.510
He said there was an
explosion, some sort of battle.

17:44.580 --> 17:46.013
Were him and Lucas on tour
together?

17:47.950 --> 17:49.016
They were.

17:51.854 --> 17:52.920
Yeah.

17:56.025 --> 17:57.725
Dave is telling me all about it.

17:59.996 --> 18:01.062
Uh-huh.

18:03.866 --> 18:04.932
Mm.

18:08.571 --> 18:10.938
Okay, I'm a bit confused now.

18:12.575 --> 18:14.809
Sara, is Lucas still with us?

18:17.046 --> 18:18.946
No, no.

18:22.819 --> 18:27.555
Dave is telling me Lucas
wasn't

18:27.557 --> 18:29.857
with them during the explosion.

18:29.859 --> 18:30.925
What?

18:31.761 --> 18:33.361
I mean, they never found his
body.

18:34.831 --> 18:36.931
Right, okay, this is
making more sense now.

18:38.534 --> 18:39.600
What happened?

18:40.770 --> 18:41.836
Hold on.

18:42.605 --> 18:43.904
I'm losing him, hold on.

18:47.410 --> 18:48.943
Something happened with Lucas.

18:52.115 --> 18:55.683
He was involved with something,
so he wasn't with his group.

18:57.620 --> 19:01.021
He had to, he had to leave?

19:03.693 --> 19:04.859
Do you understand this, Sara?

19:08.164 --> 19:09.496
No.

19:09.498 --> 19:10.831
Dave is telling me Lucas was
involved

19:10.833 --> 19:15.069
in something and left them
behind.

19:18.941 --> 19:20.941
Lucas told Dave where
he was going, though.

19:22.412 --> 19:24.845
Sara, get your phone and
write this down real quick.

19:27.984 --> 19:31.752
Somewhere, somewhere in the
mountains.

19:34.824 --> 19:36.791
He says you've been there
before, Sara.

19:38.694 --> 19:41.529
Wait, I'm losing the rest.

19:45.668 --> 19:50.738
I hear the letter Y.

19:50.740 --> 19:52.706
Something yo, yose.

19:55.945 --> 20:01.015
I see a house with a
green roof.

20:05.988 --> 20:07.570
Mike?

20:07.572 --> 20:09.155
- Mike, Mike, are you okay?
- Oh my god, Mike, Mike!

20:09.158 --> 20:10.491
What's going on?

20:10.493 --> 20:11.859
It's okay.

20:11.861 --> 20:12.693
What happened?

20:12.695 --> 20:14.728
Mike, you passed out.

20:14.730 --> 20:17.164
You blacked out after talking to
Dave.

20:17.166 --> 20:18.815
Huh?

20:18.817 --> 20:20.467
Does this happen after you
channel?

20:20.470 --> 20:22.136
Never.

20:23.473 --> 20:26.106
I remember speaking with Dave,

20:27.143 --> 20:29.677
and then something overwhelmed
me.

20:30.680 --> 20:31.679
Everything went dark.

20:35.017 --> 20:37.051
Do you think Lucas is still
alive?

20:40.690 --> 20:41.989
I wish I could answer that.

20:43.025 --> 20:44.091
I don't know.

20:46.062 --> 20:48.028
Do you know what Dave
meant with what he said?

20:50.900 --> 20:55.236
Yes, Lucas grew up in
a ranch near Yosemite.

21:00.943 --> 21:02.977
Maybe that's where he
is.

21:07.149 --> 21:08.047
Let's go then.

21:08.049 --> 21:08.948
Please, will you come with us?

21:08.951 --> 21:11.685
No, I can't right now,
please.

21:11.687 --> 21:13.754
I'll pay you.

21:13.756 --> 21:14.922
You gotta go get him!

21:14.924 --> 21:15.823
He's the real thing!

21:15.825 --> 21:17.658
Come on, go, go get him!

21:17.660 --> 21:19.593
I know, I know,
I know, I know, I know.

21:21.664 --> 21:23.797
Mike, hey Mike!

21:30.606 --> 21:31.272
Patrick?

21:32.608 --> 21:34.208
Sorry, babe,
wrong guy.

21:34.210 --> 21:37.578
Patrick, it's me, Abby.

21:37.580 --> 21:39.580
- Hey!
- Patrick?

21:39.582 --> 21:41.715
Nice try, babe.

21:51.694 --> 21:52.626
Can you play some music?

21:52.628 --> 21:53.827
Mm, yeah.

21:56.065 --> 21:59.266
Come on, it
goes with the project.

22:00.636 --> 22:02.636
Why don't you save the
battery?

22:02.638 --> 22:03.938
I have plenty of
batteries.

22:03.940 --> 22:05.973
I wanna catch all the boring
stuff

22:05.975 --> 22:07.341
so the good stuff sticks out.

22:07.343 --> 22:08.609
Whatever.

22:09.879 --> 22:11.045
I swear to God, you better not
pull

22:11.047 --> 22:12.146
the same crap you always do.

22:12.148 --> 22:14.315
What are you talking
about?

22:14.317 --> 22:16.684
You know, where you say
that if I drive there,

22:16.686 --> 22:18.218
you'll drive on the way back.

22:18.220 --> 22:19.720
Yeah, that
doesn't seem unfair at all.

22:19.722 --> 22:21.155
And then you end up feeling
sick

22:21.157 --> 22:23.691
or tired the day we're supposed
to leave,

22:23.693 --> 22:25.693
and I end up driving back home,
too.

22:25.695 --> 22:26.860
Okay, that's not too
far off.

22:26.862 --> 22:27.861
I'm normally sick and...

22:27.863 --> 22:29.163
Emily, stop!

22:29.165 --> 22:30.247
Don't screw with me.

22:30.249 --> 22:31.332
This is a really long drive.

22:31.334 --> 22:34.201
All right, jeez,
what's wrong with you?

22:35.338 --> 22:38.639
Oh, I forgot to fill my
prescription.

22:38.641 --> 22:40.608
Oh my god, are you
serious?

22:41.944 --> 22:43.277
Yeah.

22:43.279 --> 22:45.312
Are you gonna be okay?

22:45.314 --> 22:47.615
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I
think I saw a few pills

22:47.617 --> 22:49.216
rolling around in the
bottom of my bag, so.

22:49.218 --> 22:51.685
All right, and you're
sure?

22:51.687 --> 22:52.720
Yeah.

22:52.722 --> 22:53.387
All right.

22:54.890 --> 22:57.391
Do you think it was a
bad idea comin' out here?

22:57.393 --> 22:59.126
What are you talking
about?

23:00.062 --> 23:01.362
I mean, the only other medium
we saw

23:01.364 --> 23:04.064
was screaming at us, "Don't go."

23:04.066 --> 23:06.233
That guy was fake,
Sara.

23:07.637 --> 23:08.769
Yeah, I guess.

23:10.740 --> 23:12.973
I'm feeling sick.

23:12.975 --> 23:14.375
Okay, like carsick,
carsick?

23:14.377 --> 23:16.059
Yeah.

23:16.061 --> 23:17.744
All right, well, I
don't know.

23:17.747 --> 23:18.879
What do you want me to do?

23:20.850 --> 23:22.249
I need some fresh air.

23:22.251 --> 23:24.818
Uh, okay, all right.

23:27.023 --> 23:29.823
- Just stop!
- This thing is heavy.

23:29.825 --> 23:34.028
Hey, say
hello to our fans, Sara.

23:34.030 --> 23:36.430
We have
like three followers.

23:36.432 --> 23:38.032
Whatever.

23:38.034 --> 23:40.334
Damn, look at that view.

23:42.438 --> 23:47.808
Middle of nowhere.

23:52.148 --> 23:53.947
Emily is tryin'
to get a hold of Mike.

23:53.949 --> 23:56.450
He was supposed to meet us
here at the cabin a while ago.

24:01.791 --> 24:04.124
Of course, she told me to
turn the camera back on.

24:08.798 --> 24:09.863
Em?

24:19.975 --> 24:22.876
Hey, let's just go without him.

24:24.146 --> 24:27.181
Get off your stupid phone!

24:32.788 --> 24:34.354
Doesn't look like anyone's
here.

24:35.825 --> 24:37.057
- Oh shit!
- Who is that?

24:37.059 --> 24:40.194
Oh my god!

24:40.196 --> 24:42.429
It's just Mike, oh my god.

24:43.332 --> 24:46.200
Sorry, didn't mean to scare
you guys.

24:46.202 --> 24:47.935
Did you see that guy?

24:47.937 --> 24:48.969
What guy?

24:48.971 --> 24:49.970
I didn't see anyone.

24:49.972 --> 24:52.072
We both saw someone.

24:52.074 --> 24:54.108
There shouldn't be
anyone out here, right?

24:58.180 --> 24:59.313
Hey, what's going on?

24:59.315 --> 25:01.181
It looks like he sees
someone.

25:01.183 --> 25:02.516
You go, go, go see what's he
doing!

25:02.518 --> 25:03.883
Wait, why me?

25:03.885 --> 25:05.251
Because I'm the getaway
driver if he goes crazy!

25:05.254 --> 25:06.820
Oh.

25:09.859 --> 25:10.924
Mike?

25:11.794 --> 25:12.860
Are you okay?

25:14.997 --> 25:16.196
You're freaking me out.

25:20.436 --> 25:21.401
Dammit Emily!

25:40.681 --> 25:41.905
- What was wrong with him?
- What's wrong with you?

25:41.907 --> 25:43.131
Why'd you keep turning the
lights off?

25:43.133 --> 25:44.358
I was trying to get the car
started!

25:44.360 --> 25:46.176
What happened?

25:46.178 --> 25:47.995
I don't know, he
freaked out or something.

25:47.997 --> 25:49.296
Great, so what now?

25:52.501 --> 25:54.484
I don't know.

25:54.486 --> 25:56.470
I mean, we didn't come all
this way to not get answers.

25:59.041 --> 25:59.940
I know the door code.

26:01.410 --> 26:03.944
Okay, great, let's go!

26:07.249 --> 26:08.982
I'm gonna just make sure it's
balanced.

26:08.984 --> 26:09.983
- Yeah.
- Got it.

26:09.985 --> 26:11.051
Okay.

26:49.158 --> 26:51.558
It doesn't look like anyone's
been here for a while.

26:53.062 --> 26:55.062
Feels like I
was here just yesterday.

27:04.273 --> 27:05.639
Um, come look at this.

27:14.116 --> 27:15.616
Look.

27:15.618 --> 27:17.351
I remember taking this
picture.

27:17.353 --> 27:18.518
Please tell me you're
the one

27:18.520 --> 27:19.987
that scratched out their faces.

27:19.989 --> 27:22.456
Are you crazy, why would I do
that?

27:22.458 --> 27:24.024
I don't know.

27:24.026 --> 27:26.159
It was probably Lucas.

27:26.161 --> 27:27.628
This is so screwed up.

27:30.933 --> 27:33.066
This place brings back so many
memories.

27:35.104 --> 27:36.169
I really miss him.

27:44.546 --> 27:46.146
I know, okay.

27:46.148 --> 27:48.949
I know, but you gotta leave
it in the past, right?

27:48.951 --> 27:51.285
'Cause you have Taylor, right?

27:51.287 --> 27:53.620
Taylor's nice to you and he's
rich

27:53.622 --> 27:58.492
and he loves you, so you're
gonna be fine.

28:03.465 --> 28:05.265
Lucas's parents should
never have pushed him

28:05.267 --> 28:07.167
so hard to join the military.

28:07.169 --> 28:10.470
I know, I know.

28:14.209 --> 28:15.375
Where are his parents?

28:17.479 --> 28:21.415
I haven't talked
to them in six months.

28:21.417 --> 28:22.683
They went to Europe, last I
heard.

28:44.106 --> 28:46.440
Um.

28:48.143 --> 28:49.509
Sara, look!

28:53.115 --> 28:54.481
Come on, one for Lucas.

28:58.687 --> 28:59.553
All right.

29:03.325 --> 29:04.591
Okay, let's.

29:06.729 --> 29:08.028
Wait, wait, wait, here.

29:12.768 --> 29:14.267
Oh my god, cheers?

29:14.269 --> 29:15.102
Cheers.

29:19.074 --> 29:22.075
Oh!

29:22.077 --> 29:25.145
Oh my god.

29:45.100 --> 29:47.234
Emily forced this best
on me.

29:52.708 --> 29:55.509
And this is where Lucas was
made.

30:01.417 --> 30:04.618
I'm so glad Emily's
sleeping in here.

30:05.621 --> 30:07.187
Oh, what a slob.

30:14.196 --> 30:19.433
And this is where

30:19.435 --> 30:22.569
Lucas and I, you get the idea.

30:26.075 --> 30:30.110
And this is Lucas.

30:31.780 --> 30:32.846
I'm sorry.

30:36.351 --> 30:39.352
Oh, what is that?

30:40.622 --> 30:45.325
"Self-gratification with no
guilt or shame

30:45.327 --> 30:48.128
"instead of the denial of
pleasure."

30:49.098 --> 30:51.164
Oh, is that blood?

30:52.201 --> 30:54.267
Em?

31:07.416 --> 31:10.217
Mike, what are you doing?

31:11.353 --> 31:13.153
I'm so sorry about last night.

31:13.155 --> 31:14.488
Yeah, what happened?

31:15.824 --> 31:17.073
Can I come in?

31:17.075 --> 31:18.325
Uh, I don't know if
that's...

31:18.327 --> 31:19.759
Oh, look who decided to come
back.

31:24.233 --> 31:27.234
So you gonna tell us why you
freaked out and disappeared?

31:27.236 --> 31:28.702
Yeah, where'd you stay last
night?

31:30.739 --> 31:33.707
I started going home and
stayed at a motel in town.

31:35.277 --> 31:37.177
Again, I'm sorry about what
happened.

31:39.481 --> 31:41.515
There was an energy
coming from this cabin,

31:42.784 --> 31:43.717
one I've never felt.

31:46.188 --> 31:48.771
When I connect with the
departed,

31:48.773 --> 31:51.357
I sometimes receive
glimpses of how they passed.

31:52.327 --> 31:53.426
So, what?

31:53.428 --> 31:55.195
Are you saying somebody died
here?

31:58.167 --> 31:59.232
Mike.

32:01.537 --> 32:04.404
I don't know if it was here
exactly or close to here.

32:07.409 --> 32:08.942
It wasn't a natural death,
though.

32:10.946 --> 32:12.646
I felt two people suffering.

32:13.916 --> 32:15.315
What do you mean?

32:17.519 --> 32:18.885
These people were murdered.

32:24.193 --> 32:26.359
It was in such a cruel way.

32:29.398 --> 32:30.697
They begged for it to stop.

32:33.268 --> 32:35.335
Slowly gutted like animals.

32:45.247 --> 32:49.216
Do you know what that means?

32:49.218 --> 32:51.218
Do you know what this means?

32:51.220 --> 32:52.319
Mm.

32:52.321 --> 32:53.220
What is it?

32:54.990 --> 32:56.389
The demon's creed.

32:57.392 --> 32:58.758
How do you know that?

32:59.528 --> 33:00.694
You meet all kinds of people

33:00.696 --> 33:02.462
when you claim you can talk to
ghosts.

33:04.533 --> 33:05.799
Is that Lucas's handwriting?

33:07.269 --> 33:08.568
I don't know.

33:08.570 --> 33:09.636
It could be.

33:14.243 --> 33:18.311
No, no, Lucas wouldn't get
into something like this.

33:18.313 --> 33:19.346
What?

33:19.348 --> 33:20.646
Wait, Sara, what are you doing?

33:20.648 --> 33:21.947
Stop, I don't wanna
hear anymore.

33:21.950 --> 33:24.551
- You said you could...
- Shut up, shut up!

33:29.291 --> 33:32.826
If he's alive, I'll wait for
him.

33:32.828 --> 33:33.994
God.

33:33.996 --> 33:36.529
Even if he's gotten into this
shit,

33:36.531 --> 33:38.431
I'll help him get out of it!

33:38.433 --> 33:39.866
I'll help him get out of it!

33:39.868 --> 33:41.835
Stop, wait, Sara!

33:41.837 --> 33:43.003
No, stop, stop, stop.

33:43.005 --> 33:44.404
She's off her meds.

33:44.406 --> 33:45.405
She just needs to calm down.

33:45.407 --> 33:46.973
She doesn't get it.

33:46.975 --> 33:49.342
Okay, well, try me.

33:49.344 --> 33:52.646
Those words, if Lucas wrote
that,

33:52.648 --> 33:54.014
he committed himself to Satan!

33:55.417 --> 33:57.050
Okay, Satan
like the devil Satan?

34:00.055 --> 34:01.821
Yes.

34:01.823 --> 34:05.358
Okay, what
exactly does that mean?

34:07.896 --> 34:10.297
It depends how deep he got
into this.

34:14.069 --> 34:15.402
Sara!

34:36.391 --> 34:38.625
Sara?

34:48.003 --> 34:51.871
Sara!

35:07.389 --> 35:09.422
Are you okay?

35:19.468 --> 35:21.117
I'm gonna get going.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.769
You are not
leaving us here alone again!

35:22.771 --> 35:24.471
I can't, this is too much for
me!

35:24.473 --> 35:27.006
Please, just wait
here until she comes back!

35:29.077 --> 35:30.944
Where do you think she went?

35:30.946 --> 35:31.978
I...

35:39.121 --> 35:39.953
Mike?

35:48.730 --> 35:51.798
Mike?

35:57.906 --> 35:58.972
Sara?

36:05.113 --> 36:06.179
Lucas?

36:07.983 --> 36:11.718
Oh God, Lucas is not here.

36:16.625 --> 36:17.857
What the hell are you doing?

36:17.859 --> 36:19.426
Why are all the cabinets open?

36:29.905 --> 36:31.905
None of this is good.

36:33.442 --> 36:34.474
I need a drink.

36:43.685 --> 36:46.019
Emily to spirit world.

36:48.523 --> 36:50.924
Come in, spirit world.

36:52.794 --> 36:53.860
Over.

36:58.467 --> 36:59.732
Didn't work.

37:00.702 --> 37:02.035
What are you doing?

37:02.037 --> 37:04.103
Turn that off.

37:04.105 --> 37:06.172
No way, this is the
good stuff.

37:10.212 --> 37:15.181
So is Mike short for Michael?

37:21.656 --> 37:26.192
Mike, are you connecting
with the spirit world?

37:28.730 --> 37:31.564
I'm just a little buzzed.

37:33.034 --> 37:35.768
Well, someone's a lightweight.

37:49.017 --> 37:53.887
Okay, so tell me how alcohol
affects your process?

37:54.789 --> 37:56.055
How do you think?

37:59.561 --> 38:02.061
I think we all need to get
to know you a little better.

38:06.301 --> 38:09.068
How old were you
when you lost your virginity?

38:10.639 --> 38:12.071
What?

38:13.241 --> 38:18.111
Okay, so, um,

38:18.113 --> 38:21.080
do you think it's wrong
to take money from people

38:21.082 --> 38:23.216
who are mourning the
loss of their loved ones?

38:24.085 --> 38:25.685
What's that supposed to mean?

38:26.988 --> 38:28.821
I'm just asking for the
documentary.

38:29.991 --> 38:32.158
No, I don't think it's wrong.

38:32.160 --> 38:34.260
I mean, I have to make a
living somehow, don't I?

38:35.664 --> 38:38.665
I can't stand when people
question that.

38:38.667 --> 38:40.567
We were all given gifts

38:40.569 --> 38:43.603
and we should all use
'em to our advantage.

38:43.605 --> 38:47.674
Rather than shying away
from this, I've embraced it.

38:47.676 --> 38:50.677
I've welcomed the one thing
most people are so afraid of.

38:51.780 --> 38:53.813
Everyone hides from it with
religion

38:53.815 --> 38:56.215
or this idea called faith.

38:56.217 --> 38:58.151
The most popular question
today has an answer,

38:58.153 --> 39:00.186
but no one is willing to listen.

39:00.188 --> 39:03.723
Okay, I think someone needs a
refill.

39:06.061 --> 39:07.594
Give me your glass.

39:07.596 --> 39:11.230
Yeah, sorry about that.

39:11.232 --> 39:12.899
You struck a chord.

39:41.796 --> 39:42.862
Mike?

39:53.642 --> 39:54.307
Mike?

39:59.080 --> 40:00.780
Mike?

40:00.782 --> 40:02.715
Sara?

40:21.269 --> 40:22.402
Who moved this?

40:24.839 --> 40:26.773
What's going on?

40:43.024 --> 40:44.090
Mike?

40:55.170 --> 40:56.102
He left?

40:56.104 --> 40:57.170
Again?

40:58.406 --> 40:59.472
Sara!

41:01.376 --> 41:03.476
I'm officially freaked out.

41:05.246 --> 41:06.312
I'm leaving!

41:09.284 --> 41:14.353
Get the hell outta here.

42:23.291 --> 42:24.357
Sara?

43:27.856 --> 43:30.223
Sara?

43:37.031 --> 43:41.901
Sara, come on, you can't stay
pissed all night!

43:56.651 --> 44:01.320
Is that you?

44:09.530 --> 44:10.596
Hello?

44:10.598 --> 44:16.269
Who's there?

44:21.009 --> 44:23.109
Sara?

44:23.111 --> 44:25.244
Sara, is that you?

44:29.517 --> 44:30.849
Are you okay?

44:30.851 --> 44:32.184
Okay, let's just go back into
the cabin,

44:32.186 --> 44:33.419
and we'll talk about things.

44:34.689 --> 44:36.355
Turn off the light!

44:39.928 --> 44:41.627
I don't see anything!

44:41.629 --> 44:45.364
It's late, you're just
seeing things, Sara.

44:45.366 --> 44:48.267
Wait, where'd you go?

44:48.269 --> 44:49.101
I'm scared.

44:52.407 --> 44:57.476
Okay, come on, come on, come on!

45:09.190 --> 45:10.423
That definitely wasn't
Lucas!

45:10.425 --> 45:11.423
I saw him, Emily.

45:11.425 --> 45:12.424
You need your meds.

45:12.427 --> 45:13.359
I know what I saw.

45:13.361 --> 45:14.527
We need to go back and find him.

45:14.529 --> 45:15.695
No, we're going into
the cabin!

45:15.697 --> 45:17.396
- No, no.
- Come on, come on!

45:17.398 --> 45:18.631
Stop!

45:18.633 --> 45:20.700
Mike, what's wrong?

45:20.702 --> 45:21.701
I'm losing control!

45:21.703 --> 45:23.135
What's your deal?

45:23.137 --> 45:24.570
I went to the police
station.

45:24.572 --> 45:26.472
What are you talkin'
about?

45:26.474 --> 45:29.075
I'm sorry I left in
the middle of the night!

45:29.077 --> 45:30.242
The voices won't stop!

45:30.244 --> 45:31.860
I can't make them stop!

45:31.862 --> 45:33.479
I can tell you right
now, we can't trust this guy!

45:33.481 --> 45:36.215
Do you remember when I told
you

45:36.217 --> 45:37.350
about the two people that were
murdered?

45:37.352 --> 45:38.985
Yes!

45:38.987 --> 45:40.235
They were Lucas's parents.

45:40.237 --> 45:41.486
- They spoke to me in the night.
- No, you're lying!

45:41.489 --> 45:43.155
- It ain't true.
- You're lying!

45:43.157 --> 45:44.557
Why would I lie?

45:44.559 --> 45:45.725
How do you know it was them?

45:45.727 --> 45:47.543
How do you know?

45:47.545 --> 45:49.362
Mike, are you sure it
was them?

45:50.398 --> 45:52.053
I'm so sorry.

45:52.055 --> 45:53.710
No, you're just saying
this so that we'd leave.

45:53.712 --> 45:55.368
You were right about us
needing to leave, Sara.

45:55.370 --> 45:56.736
What about the bodies?

45:56.738 --> 45:58.170
What do you mean?

45:58.172 --> 45:59.605
Did the police
find his parents' bodies?

45:59.607 --> 46:01.474
Oh, fuck!

46:01.476 --> 46:02.742
Oh, you're full of
shit!

46:02.744 --> 46:05.111
Then why did you ask me to
come here?

46:05.113 --> 46:06.545
All this and I'm a
fraud because I tell you

46:06.547 --> 46:08.614
something you don't wanna hear?

46:10.318 --> 46:13.185
His parents told me if we don't
leave!

46:13.187 --> 46:14.353
I know you wanna find
out

46:14.355 --> 46:15.688
about Lucas, but enough is
enough!

46:15.690 --> 46:17.023
I'm not leaving!

46:17.025 --> 46:17.690
No, wait!

46:19.027 --> 46:20.259
- Where is your car?
- I don't know.

46:20.261 --> 46:21.494
What do you
mean, you don't know?

46:21.496 --> 46:22.595
I don't know!

46:23.631 --> 46:26.599
I blacked out!

46:26.601 --> 46:28.267
I feel something coming over me!

46:28.269 --> 46:29.435
What is it?

46:29.437 --> 46:31.570
Lucas gutted his own parents!

46:31.572 --> 46:34.240
Why, why would he do
that?

46:34.242 --> 46:37.610
It was a sacrifice to Lucifer.

46:41.649 --> 46:45.351
Where
the hell are my keys?

46:45.353 --> 46:48.354
God!

46:48.356 --> 46:51.424
I left them right here!

46:53.294 --> 46:55.694
- My God.
- Lucas, no!

46:55.696 --> 46:57.229
What the heck, Mike?

47:00.234 --> 47:01.500
Lucas is here?

47:03.771 --> 47:05.771
Sara, where are the
keys?

47:08.109 --> 47:09.408
I don't know, I don't have
'em.

47:09.410 --> 47:10.776
Damn it, Sara!

47:12.246 --> 47:14.080
Come on, you gotta pull it
together!

47:14.082 --> 47:17.550
We have to leave!

47:20.188 --> 47:21.353
Sara!

47:21.355 --> 47:23.155
Back off!

47:23.157 --> 47:25.658
I have an idea.

47:25.660 --> 47:26.692
Come here.

47:30.865 --> 47:32.164
Damn it!

47:32.166 --> 47:33.265
What?

47:33.267 --> 47:34.767
It's a newer model.

47:34.769 --> 47:36.302
You can't hot-wire these things.

47:36.304 --> 47:37.436
Well, please, please
just try

47:37.438 --> 47:39.138
so we can get out of here.

47:39.140 --> 47:41.607
I'll see what I can
do.

47:44.679 --> 47:47.146
What was that?

47:47.148 --> 47:48.314
Probably just an animal.

47:52.453 --> 47:54.253
Go inside, I'll figure this out.

48:05.199 --> 48:06.265
Sara?

48:07.435 --> 48:09.735
What are you doin' out?

48:13.808 --> 48:17.476
Em said we needed to
document everything.

48:18.613 --> 48:21.313
Uh, you should go to bed.

48:22.416 --> 48:23.682
I need to show you something.

48:25.486 --> 48:27.186
What is it?

48:27.188 --> 48:31.457
Please, please just come with
me.

48:33.227 --> 48:34.660
Okay, show me.

48:34.662 --> 48:35.728
Okay.

48:43.538 --> 48:44.603
Here we go.

48:49.177 --> 48:50.543
You okay?

48:51.612 --> 48:52.845
Look.

48:59.287 --> 49:00.486
Did you rewrite those?

49:03.591 --> 49:06.358
No.

49:06.360 --> 49:08.427
Then they came
back out of nowhere.

49:26.914 --> 49:27.947
Where's Lucas?

49:32.520 --> 49:33.686
Shh.

49:36.290 --> 49:39.291
Everything's gonna be okay, all
right?

49:49.870 --> 49:50.936
Lucas?

49:54.442 --> 49:55.507
Is that you?

50:00.581 --> 50:01.413
Here.

50:01.415 --> 50:02.481
Lucas?

50:04.252 --> 50:05.317
Take this.

50:09.323 --> 50:10.856
What is it?

50:12.893 --> 50:14.393
It'll help you sleep.

50:14.395 --> 50:16.762
Oh.

50:20.868 --> 50:21.934
Okay.

51:18.626 --> 51:20.659
All right, come here.

55:36.584 --> 55:41.219
I don't have
anyone to talk to and...

55:46.060 --> 55:48.360
This is gonna sound crazy,

55:48.362 --> 55:53.231
but I need to get these
thoughts out of my head.

55:59.106 --> 56:03.308
I, I think I really
do need my medicine.

56:07.748 --> 56:11.717
Because if not, then,

56:11.719 --> 56:13.719
Lucas was really in my room last
night.

56:18.192 --> 56:21.026
I was, I was really messed up,
so...

56:23.030 --> 56:27.399
But,

56:27.401 --> 56:28.734
I felt Lucas.

56:28.736 --> 56:29.901
I know he was there.

56:29.903 --> 56:31.303
I know he was there.

56:32.906 --> 56:37.776
I felt him.

56:40.648 --> 56:45.317
And when I woke up,

56:50.024 --> 56:51.089
I was alone,

56:55.396 --> 56:57.329
and my window was open.

57:18.118 --> 57:21.186
This book says that Satan is
not a being to be worshiped

57:22.256 --> 57:25.323
but a metaphor, an idea of how
to live.

57:30.064 --> 57:32.698
This chapter talks about sexual
freedom,

57:32.700 --> 57:34.166
nothing evil in this book so
far.

57:36.870 --> 57:39.271
All of this goes against what
Mike has been telling us.

57:41.709 --> 57:42.774
Where is Mike anyway?

58:04.465 --> 58:05.731
Lucas.

58:44.104 --> 58:45.804
I've looked outside.

58:45.806 --> 58:47.806
I looked in the upstairs.

58:47.808 --> 58:49.157
I can't find her anywhere.

58:49.159 --> 58:50.509
I can't find anyone.

58:50.511 --> 58:52.244
Sara?

58:52.246 --> 58:53.845
What's happening?

58:53.847 --> 58:55.447
- No, get off of me!
- Oh, no, no, no, no, Sara!

58:55.449 --> 58:57.349
Sara, Sara, get back, get back!

58:57.351 --> 59:00.819
What is she doing?

59:02.523 --> 59:04.122
Sara, what are you doing?

59:04.124 --> 59:06.024
Hey, you're acting crazy!

59:06.026 --> 59:07.325
- Sara, get off!
- I'm going to kill you!

59:07.327 --> 59:09.494
Sara, Sara, get off!

59:09.496 --> 59:13.064
Sara, get off!

59:13.066 --> 59:13.999
Where are you going?

59:14.001 --> 59:15.333
Come back!

59:15.335 --> 59:16.334
Emily!

59:16.336 --> 59:17.836
What is it?

59:18.939 --> 59:21.406
Wait, she's had these the whole
time?

59:21.408 --> 59:23.441
Sara's
taken this too far.

59:27.114 --> 59:28.180
Damn, no signal!

59:29.449 --> 59:31.183
Let me see if I can get
reception somewhere else.

59:31.185 --> 59:32.818
Okay, wait,
wait.

59:34.354 --> 59:37.055
Is this Sara's handwriting?

59:37.057 --> 59:37.989
Oh, shit!

59:37.991 --> 59:39.491
Oh, no, Mike!

59:39.493 --> 59:40.458
Mike, open the door!

59:40.460 --> 59:42.360
- Emily?
- Help me!

59:42.362 --> 59:43.461
God, Mike, help!

59:43.463 --> 59:44.396
I'm trying!

59:46.834 --> 59:48.333
Are you okay?

59:48.335 --> 59:50.318
Where are you going?

59:50.320 --> 59:52.304
Are
you who you say you are?

59:53.207 --> 59:54.406
What?

59:54.408 --> 59:56.107
This is all in Sara's head.

59:56.109 --> 1:00:00.445
God, she's going
crazy, isn't she?

1:00:01.615 --> 1:00:02.981
We all need to get outta here.

1:00:02.983 --> 1:00:05.283
Okay, I'll go find her
outside.

1:00:05.285 --> 1:00:07.319
You wait here if she comes back,
okay?

1:00:07.321 --> 1:00:08.587
Okay.

1:00:08.589 --> 1:00:09.621
All right.

1:00:37.184 --> 1:00:38.250
Sara?

1:01:03.477 --> 1:01:08.546
Sara, is that you?

1:01:39.713 --> 1:01:44.416
Sara, please!

1:02:05.639 --> 1:02:08.473
Get away from me!

1:02:08.475 --> 1:02:13.345
What do you
want from me?

1:02:19.419 --> 1:02:20.818
Lucas.

1:02:20.820 --> 1:02:22.220
No, no, Sara, he's dead, okay?

1:02:22.222 --> 1:02:23.288
They told us at the house!

1:02:23.290 --> 1:02:25.090
- He's dead!
- I found him.

1:02:25.092 --> 1:02:26.024
- He's alive.
- You're losing it!

1:02:26.026 --> 1:02:28.093
You're saying random shit, Sara!

1:02:28.095 --> 1:02:29.527
I saw him!

1:02:29.529 --> 1:02:31.529
- I felt him!
- No, why are you doing this?

1:02:31.531 --> 1:02:33.031
I told you already,
you don't understand!

1:02:33.033 --> 1:02:34.332
I can't, I
can't, you're losing it!

1:02:34.334 --> 1:02:36.434
You're saying random shit, Sara!

1:02:36.436 --> 1:02:38.136
Mike, Mike
isn't who he says he is.

1:02:38.138 --> 1:02:39.186
He's manipulating us.

1:02:39.188 --> 1:02:40.237
Are you even
listening to yourself?

1:02:40.240 --> 1:02:41.339
I have proof!

1:02:41.341 --> 1:02:42.684
- I have proof!
- No, please stop!

1:02:42.686 --> 1:02:44.029
- Please stop, Sara!
- Oh, where is it?

1:02:44.031 --> 1:02:45.375
- I must have dropped it maybe...
- We need to go!

1:02:45.379 --> 1:02:46.277
We need to go!

1:02:46.279 --> 1:02:48.213
We need to go, Sara, stop!

1:02:48.215 --> 1:02:49.447
Come on!

1:02:49.449 --> 1:02:51.583
Em?

1:02:54.588 --> 1:02:59.557
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no!

1:03:01.328 --> 1:03:02.394
Em, Em!

1:03:03.397 --> 1:03:07.365
I'm really sorry, Ems.

1:03:10.370 --> 1:03:11.403
Lu.

1:03:11.405 --> 1:03:13.705
Come back, come back, come back!

1:03:36.663 --> 1:03:37.729
Emily?

1:03:40.534 --> 1:03:41.599
Emily?

1:03:42.335 --> 1:03:44.436
Oh, oh, where did you go?

1:03:44.438 --> 1:03:46.371
Where did you go?

1:03:46.373 --> 1:03:49.207
Emily!

1:03:49.209 --> 1:03:53.678
Oh my god!

1:03:57.250 --> 1:04:01.319
Okay.

1:04:05.692 --> 1:04:09.194
This is what I wanted to show
you.

1:04:16.736 --> 1:04:18.503
Emily!

1:04:19.339 --> 1:04:21.272
What's going on?

1:04:21.274 --> 1:04:22.740
What's going on?

1:04:22.742 --> 1:04:24.242
Emily!

1:04:27.029 --> 1:04:29.813
No, no, someone help, help!

1:04:31.284 --> 1:04:35.887
Someone, help!

1:04:40.894 --> 1:04:41.759
Help!

1:04:43.730 --> 1:04:47.765
Help!

1:04:47.767 --> 1:04:50.368
No!

1:04:56.877 --> 1:04:57.876
Oh wait, why is...

1:05:03.850 --> 1:05:08.386
Who the hell is this guy?

1:05:52.432 --> 1:05:55.266
If anything happens
to me, it's because of him.

1:07:53.820 --> 1:07:54.886
Patrick?

1:07:57.791 --> 1:07:59.090
That is your real name, isn't
it?

1:08:42.502 --> 1:08:43.668
What are you holding?

1:08:52.479 --> 1:08:53.778
What are you holding?

1:09:01.121 --> 1:09:02.920
What are you holding?

1:09:12.665 --> 1:09:14.031
Oh no!

1:09:20.540 --> 1:09:24.876
Give me that!

1:09:26.980 --> 1:09:28.045
No!

1:09:30.083 --> 1:09:32.683
Are you scared?

1:09:33.653 --> 1:09:36.120
You should be.

1:09:38.158 --> 1:09:39.490
No!

1:09:39.492 --> 1:09:41.191
- Huh?
- No!

1:09:41.193 --> 1:09:42.893
How do you like
your documentary now, huh?

1:09:42.896 --> 1:09:45.730
No, Emily!

1:09:45.732 --> 1:09:47.932
You left Lucas!

1:09:48.935 --> 1:09:51.035
This is what you get!

1:09:53.206 --> 1:09:54.939
Give me that!

1:09:56.643 --> 1:09:58.676
Are you having fun?

1:09:58.678 --> 1:10:01.979
It took me a while to set this
place up!

1:10:01.981 --> 1:10:06.717
I guess I know the military
things after all!

1:10:06.719 --> 1:10:07.952
I did this for you, Lucas!

1:10:09.022 --> 1:10:09.987
It was all for you!

1:10:11.791 --> 1:10:13.224
It wasn't your fault!

1:10:17.530 --> 1:10:22.200
He took one wrong step and
then everything went black.

1:10:23.736 --> 1:10:28.239
The IED explosion
wiped out half our platoon!

1:10:31.578 --> 1:10:34.679
Me and the other seven
came to after a while!

1:10:34.681 --> 1:10:37.782
We were tied up next
to each other in a cage

1:10:37.784 --> 1:10:41.185
with the enemy screaming
at us and torturing us!

1:10:44.524 --> 1:10:49.193
After six months, it was
only me and him left!

1:10:52.699 --> 1:10:54.265
Why did you do it?

1:10:55.668 --> 1:10:57.869
Why did you abandon Lucas

1:10:57.871 --> 1:11:00.238
the same way the VA abandoned us
both?

1:11:00.240 --> 1:11:01.772
No!

1:11:09.849 --> 1:11:12.065
I can't wait for
everyone

1:11:12.067 --> 1:11:14.284
to see what I'm gonna do to you!

1:11:14.287 --> 1:11:17.788
Sara!

1:11:17.790 --> 1:11:20.525
Are you out here?

1:11:21.828 --> 1:11:25.296
Think you can
beat me at my own game?

1:11:32.772 --> 1:11:37.108
Sara, Lucas is waiting for you!

1:12:11.578 --> 1:12:15.880
Emily!

1:13:17.810 --> 1:13:21.278
It's really you.

1:13:24.951 --> 1:13:28.319
Oh, I missed you.

1:13:34.060 --> 1:13:35.693
What are you doing?

1:13:35.695 --> 1:13:37.795
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1:13:38.998 --> 1:13:43.434
Stop, stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop!

1:14:16.002 --> 1:14:18.269
How does it feel?

1:14:24.377 --> 1:14:25.242
Brother?

1:14:30.383 --> 1:14:31.982
When I snapped her neck, it
was

1:14:31.984 --> 1:14:33.851
the best feeling I've ever had.

1:14:39.926 --> 1:14:41.125
But I killed her too quick.

1:14:42.729 --> 1:14:45.162
Yeah, that cunt
deserved

1:14:45.164 --> 1:14:47.231
more than being scared for a few
days.

1:14:48.768 --> 1:14:53.838
Yeah.

1:14:55.274 --> 1:14:58.976
Do you remember that day that
I swept the road for bombs?

1:14:58.978 --> 1:15:01.479
You were off your
game 'cause of that bitch.

1:15:01.481 --> 1:15:04.849
Those six months we spent
in hell were 'cause of her.

1:15:08.187 --> 1:15:09.253
Yeah.

1:15:11.824 --> 1:15:12.923
I killed her too quick.

1:15:15.828 --> 1:15:16.894
That's okay.

1:15:20.066 --> 1:15:21.332
We're not done yet.

1:15:23.069 --> 1:15:24.135
Yeah.

1:15:26.139 --> 1:15:28.906
Since Crystal married my own
brother, let's kill 'em both.

1:15:32.879 --> 1:15:34.178
Done.

1:15:38.484 --> 1:15:39.984
I'm gonna go take one last look
at her.

1:15:39.986 --> 1:15:41.218
Here, wait.

1:15:44.023 --> 1:15:44.889
Take this with you.

1:16:15.154 --> 1:16:16.220
Hello?

1:16:16.956 --> 1:16:18.522
Hi, is this Crystal?

1:16:18.524 --> 1:16:21.225
Um, yeah, who is
this?

1:16:21.227 --> 1:16:25.029
Lucas, I'm calling about
Patrick Enders.

1:16:29.569 --> 1:16:31.068
Hello?

1:16:31.070 --> 1:16:34.104
Sorry, it's
just my sister Abby

1:16:34.106 --> 1:16:35.272
said she followed a car the
other day

1:16:35.274 --> 1:16:37.241
because she could've sworn she
saw him,

1:16:37.243 --> 1:16:40.578
but Patrick died in Iraq
a little over a year ago.

1:16:40.580 --> 1:16:43.247
I was engaged to him.

1:16:43.249 --> 1:16:45.883
Are you sure he's dead?

1:16:45.885 --> 1:16:48.419
I mean, they
never found his body.

1:16:52.325 --> 1:16:54.225
I think he might still be
alive.

1:16:54.227 --> 1:16:56.093
What are you talking
about?

1:16:57.196 --> 1:16:59.430
Can we meet tomorrow?

1:16:59.432 --> 1:17:03.400
I could explain everything and
help you find some answers.

1:17:05.204 --> 1:17:07.471
Yes, of
course.
