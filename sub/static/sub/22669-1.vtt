08:43.582 --> 08:44.500
Ridiculous.

08:44.583 --> 08:45.583
Yeah, me too.

08:45.709 --> 08:47.834
Yeah. But honestly,
I thought you left town

08:47.917 --> 08:49.750
once Chez Philippe closed down.

08:49.792 --> 08:51.583
Uh, no, no, I, I...

08:51.625 --> 08:53.125
actually got lucky,

08:53.208 --> 08:54.542
'cause Alex, um,

08:54.625 --> 08:55.667
was able to give me
a job in his office.

08:55.750 --> 08:56.709
Oh.

08:56.792 --> 08:57.709
Steady work?

08:57.792 --> 08:59.542
Yeah, I mean, it's not...

08:59.625 --> 09:01.542
as exciting
as working in a kitchen, but...

09:01.625 --> 09:03.291
I hope that doesn't mean
you've stopped baking.

09:03.375 --> 09:05.625
No, I still enter a contest
every now and then,

09:05.709 --> 09:08.250
but you know, with so many
celebrity chefs these days,

09:08.333 --> 09:09.166
it's...

09:09.291 --> 09:11.583
Amateur's don't really
stand a chance.

09:11.625 --> 09:12.667
Amateur?

09:12.750 --> 09:13.834
Please, you're a pro.

09:13.917 --> 09:15.750
Uh, was a pro.

09:15.792 --> 09:16.792
Oh, come on,

09:17.000 --> 09:18.917
you can't let one
closed restaurant get you down.

09:18.959 --> 09:21.041
You have a real talent.

09:21.125 --> 09:23.458
You've got to work
with what you've got.

09:23.542 --> 09:24.417
Thanks.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.291
You've obviously done that.

09:26.333 --> 09:27.417
I mean, look at this place.

09:27.500 --> 09:28.667
Look at what you've done

09:28.750 --> 09:30.667
with our old
high school hangout.

09:30.750 --> 09:32.000
When this was your dad's place,

09:32.083 --> 09:34.083
it was two-dollar slices
and arcade games.

09:34.166 --> 09:36.667
That old claw machine
that kept breaking down?

09:36.750 --> 09:37.834
[laughs] Yes!

09:37.917 --> 09:39.417
The one that you busted open

09:39.500 --> 09:40.458
to give me that teddy bear?

09:40.500 --> 09:42.041
- I did.
- Do you remember that?

09:42.125 --> 09:42.750
Daddy!

09:42.834 --> 09:44.667
You've met Bobby, right?

09:44.750 --> 09:45.959
No, I met a little baby

09:46.000 --> 09:47.959
at a church picnic
a few years ago.

09:48.041 --> 09:49.583
You've turned into such a...

09:49.667 --> 09:51.583
Uh, don't say "little,"
don't say little...

09:51.667 --> 09:53.500
Uh, uh... a large boy.

09:54.667 --> 09:56.166
Can I show you my invention?

09:56.250 --> 09:57.583
Of course.

10:01.959 --> 10:04.250
[beeping]
It's a pizza spinner.

10:04.333 --> 10:05.709
Wow, are you kidding?

10:05.792 --> 10:06.959
That is genius.

10:07.041 --> 10:08.000
Do you know how many times

10:08.041 --> 10:09.291
I have had to lean
over the pizza

10:09.375 --> 10:10.041
to grab the last slice?

10:10.208 --> 10:11.250
You're gonna make millions.

10:11.333 --> 10:12.083
Careful,

10:12.333 --> 10:14.166

for start-up money.

10:17.583 --> 10:19.667
Oh, okay.

10:19.750 --> 10:20.834
Is this...

10:20.875 --> 10:21.959
Is this your company logo?

10:22.041 --> 10:24.166
No. It's for my friends.

10:25.542 --> 10:27.625
Sorry.

10:27.709 --> 10:28.667
Uh, should we sit down?

10:28.709 --> 10:29.959
Yeah.

10:30.041 --> 10:32.125
Okay, uh, follow me.

10:34.542 --> 10:36.542
An amazing meal
with an amazing guy,

10:36.625 --> 10:39.875
in a restaurant
that is Christmas itself.

10:39.959 --> 10:41.291
Alex, this is why I love you.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.250
I know how much
you love Christmas.

10:45.375 --> 10:46.041
Cheers.

10:46.250 --> 10:47.125
And with that holiday spirit,

10:47.417 --> 10:48.542
this is going to be
the best Christmas party

10:48.583 --> 10:49.750
we've ever had.

10:49.834 --> 10:53.458
I was actually hoping
for "I love you too," but...

10:53.542 --> 10:55.375
Kylie, you know I do.

10:56.333 --> 10:57.041
But lately,

10:57.208 --> 10:58.542
it's so much more than that.

10:58.583 --> 10:59.750
In the past year,

10:59.917 --> 11:02.667
you have filled gaps that
I didn't even know existed.

11:02.750 --> 11:03.500
[sighs]

11:03.583 --> 11:05.375
Alex, that is so sweet.

11:05.417 --> 11:07.792
I... I feel the same way.

11:07.875 --> 11:08.709
I know this isn't the job

11:08.792 --> 11:10.166
you've always dreamed of,

11:10.250 --> 11:11.542
but that's why
I want to give you

11:11.583 --> 11:13.041
a bigger role in my life.

11:13.875 --> 11:14.917
A role I didn't think

11:15.000 --> 11:16.792
anyone would ever
be able to fill.

11:16.875 --> 11:18.333

11:19.959 --> 11:21.583
Kylie...

11:24.291 --> 11:26.500
I want you to be
my office manager.

11:27.834 --> 11:29.417
It's a lot of work,

11:29.458 --> 11:30.250
but I figured

11:30.458 --> 11:32.208
with your culinary school debt,

11:32.291 --> 11:33.792
you could use a raise, and...

11:33.875 --> 11:35.917
Wait, did...

11:36.000 --> 11:37.041
[chuckles]

11:37.125 --> 11:39.750
I'm sorry, did-
did you bring me here

11:39.834 --> 11:40.917
to tell me about a promotion?

11:40.959 --> 11:42.542
Well, I wanted it to be special.

11:42.625 --> 11:44.291
I was very impressed

11:44.375 --> 11:46.250
with that video-
conferencing system

11:46.291 --> 11:47.792
you installed.

11:47.875 --> 11:50.083
Alex, that's something
I did at work.

11:50.166 --> 11:51.667
I-I...

11:51.750 --> 11:54.250
I'm your girlfriend. I...

11:54.291 --> 11:55.917
I thought this dinner
was about us.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.625
Well, it is.

11:57.709 --> 11:58.750
Hey, we're a team.

11:59.959 --> 12:02.333
A team that's going places.

12:02.417 --> 12:06.417
Hawkey Homes just had
its best year yet.

12:10.083 --> 12:11.959
Thank you
for the promotion, Alex,

12:12.041 --> 12:13.125
and I, uh,

12:13.208 --> 12:15.875
I will do my best
to make your party a success.

12:15.959 --> 12:16.792
So...

12:16.875 --> 12:18.542
we're good?

12:18.625 --> 12:21.208
As boss and employee?
Mm-hmm.

12:21.917 --> 12:23.667
I was hoping for
a little more than that.

12:23.750 --> 12:24.667

12:24.750 --> 12:25.583
So was I.

Alex, I can't come home
to just spreadsheets.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.542
I don't want to just be
part of a team,

12:32.625 --> 12:34.709
I... I want to part of a couple.

No, Alex.

They're not.

12:40.959 --> 12:42.208
I'm sorry, but...

we can be together anymore.

17:28.500 --> 17:30.041
if you could
get one here A.S.A.P.

17:30.125 --> 17:31.333
Wait, wait, what happened?

17:31.417 --> 17:32.250
Is everybody okay?

17:32.333 --> 17:33.834
What's that smell?

17:33.917 --> 17:37.125
Oh, the girls decided to bake.

17:37.166 --> 17:38.208
Long story endless,

17:38.291 --> 17:40.083
the oven is ruined.

17:43.667 --> 17:45.166
Oh no, if the oven's gone,
how am I gonna win?

17:45.250 --> 17:46.458
Win what?

17:46.542 --> 17:49.125
The American
Gingerbread Competition.

17:49.208 --> 17:50.417
The one here in Helen?

17:50.500 --> 17:51.875
I don't understand,
I thought that they...

17:51.959 --> 17:53.083
I never got a rejection letter

17:53.166 --> 17:54.000
because I got in.

17:54.083 --> 17:55.125
I'm a semi finalist.

17:55.208 --> 17:56.667
Kylie, that's huge.

17:56.750 --> 17:59.250
That prize money
would be unbelievable.

17:59.333 --> 18:01.000
Hey, good news.

18:01.083 --> 18:02.250
We will have a new oven
by Christmas.

18:02.333 --> 18:03.959
Christmas?

18:04.041 --> 18:05.208
Okay, calm down.

18:05.291 --> 18:06.291
That's only seven days.

18:06.458 --> 18:08.041
I know, but the competition
is in six days.

18:08.125 --> 18:09.083
What am I gonna do?

18:16.208 --> 18:19.625
♪ ♪

18:20.417 --> 18:23.000
Well, what about the Nelsons?

18:23.041 --> 18:24.125
They live right next door.

18:24.250 --> 18:25.834
They would let you use
their oven in a heartbeat.

18:25.917 --> 18:27.250
Ah, but I'd feel weird asking.

18:27.333 --> 18:28.125
I mean, it's the holidays.

18:28.208 --> 18:29.166
They have three kids,

18:29.250 --> 18:31.125
and I'm gonna be working
around the clock.

18:31.208 --> 18:32.208
I think it's too much to ask.

18:32.291 --> 18:33.625
What about Michelle?

18:33.709 --> 18:35.583
Michelle lives in
a bachelor apartment.

18:35.667 --> 18:37.500
She has a stove and a microwave.

18:46.208 --> 18:47.375

an English translation yet.

18:49.333 --> 18:51.542
"Ina Bruckner,
The Art of Gingerbread."

18:51.583 --> 18:53.125
You could have written that.

18:53.208 --> 18:54.333
Oh, no, no, no,
she's the master.

18:54.417 --> 18:55.375
Her books are amazing,

18:55.458 --> 18:57.417
her videos are incredible.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.542
Oh, she has such
attention to detail,

18:59.583 --> 19:01.291
it's just inspiring.

doing here?

19:05.417 --> 19:06.375
Am I really running into you

19:06.458 --> 19:08.166

19:08.250 --> 19:09.041
Yeah, is it just too weird?

19:09.125 --> 19:10.750
It's slightly weird.

19:10.834 --> 19:12.375
Nick, do you remember
my sister Tina?

19:12.417 --> 19:13.542
- Hey!
- Hey!

19:13.625 --> 19:15.875
Anybody who loans me their car
to get to prom

19:15.959 --> 19:17.250

19:17.333 --> 19:18.417
Oh, that old truck?

19:18.583 --> 19:20.250
I'm surprised you guys
made it there in one piece.

19:20.333 --> 19:21.375
Well, we did have to push it

19:21.458 --> 19:22.291
the last block.

19:25.375 --> 19:26.417
Oh, I'm just
doing some research...

19:26.500 --> 19:27.625
No, Kylie made it

19:27.792 --> 19:29.417
into that baking competition,
up at the Helen Inn?

19:29.458 --> 19:30.583
Tina, nobody cares...

19:30.667 --> 19:31.917
Oh, the gingerbread contest.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.083
Yeah.

19:33.125 --> 19:34.417
Yeah, do you know about it?

19:34.458 --> 19:35.333
How could I not?

19:35.417 --> 19:36.834
That's huge.
Congratulations.

19:38.291 --> 19:40.417
[whispering] She can help us
with the cake.

19:40.458 --> 19:41.417
Oh, I don't think so, buddy.

19:41.500 --> 19:42.625
She's got bigger fish to fry.

19:42.709 --> 19:44.583
Well, I'd love to stay and chat,

19:44.625 --> 19:47.375
but his karate teacher
does not mess around.

19:47.458 --> 19:48.917
Merry Christmas, ladies.

19:49.000 --> 19:49.917
You too.

Merry Christmas.

What?

19:56.125 --> 19:57.542
I just got a new teacher,

19:57.625 --> 20:00.166
and she's having
a Christmas pot luck.

20:00.250 --> 20:01.875
His regular teacher
went on maternity leave,

20:01.959 --> 20:03.625
and the new one wants to do
something nice for the kids.

20:03.709 --> 20:05.208
Well, that sounds like fun.

20:05.291 --> 20:06.709
It's not.

20:06.792 --> 20:09.291
I have to make
a homemade dessert,

20:09.375 --> 20:10.959

20:11.041 --> 20:14.041
You of all people should know
my desserts are tasty,

20:14.125 --> 20:15.291
but they're not much to look at.

20:15.333 --> 20:16.208
Ooh, yeah.

20:16.291 --> 20:17.500
Back when you two
were in high school,

20:17.583 --> 20:19.125
I do vaguely remember
you brought a dessert over

20:19.166 --> 20:21.667
and we placed bets
on what it was.

20:21.750 --> 20:23.333
Don't know
if we ever figured that out.

20:23.417 --> 20:25.458
See, buddy?
You dodged a bullet.

20:25.500 --> 20:26.375
But don't sweat it.

20:26.458 --> 20:27.542
I'm going to ask your teacher

20:27.625 --> 20:29.041
if we can bring
one of Ralphie's lasagnas.

20:29.125 --> 20:30.583
But, Dad...

20:31.834 --> 20:33.208

quit without notice,

20:34.834 --> 20:36.291

double-time.

20:36.375 --> 20:38.166
But hey, we're gonna have
a great Christmas anyway,

20:38.250 --> 20:39.583
right, Bobby?

20:39.667 --> 20:41.291
We're just going to dial
it down a little bit.

Nick, I'd be happy to help.

Uh, that's really nice
of you, Kylie,

20:48.417 --> 20:49.834
just one year.

20:49.917 --> 20:52.834
No, I could maybe come up
with some easy-to-bake recipes.

Please...?

so I was hoping that maybe
there was a restaurant

24:48.041 --> 24:51.625
who could let me use
one of theirs...?

24:51.709 --> 24:52.709
Oh!

24:52.792 --> 24:54.583
You want to use one of mine?

24:54.667 --> 24:56.834
Yes, but only if it's not
a huge inconvenience.

24:56.917 --> 24:59.041
No, no, you can totally use one.

24:59.125 --> 25:01.583
But you gotta clean up
after yourself.

25:01.667 --> 25:02.625
I run a tight ship back there.

25:02.709 --> 25:03.667
Oh, no, I've changed.

25:03.750 --> 25:05.458
I'm not messy anymore.

25:05.542 --> 25:07.417
No, that was the old
Kylie Watson.

25:07.458 --> 25:08.250
Okay.

25:08.458 --> 25:09.917
As long as I don't find
any gumdrops

25:09.959 --> 25:11.250
in my garlic knots.

25:11.333 --> 25:12.542
[laughs] No.

25:12.625 --> 25:13.667
I'll even use my own pans.

25:13.750 --> 25:15.583
Honestly, you'll never even
know I'm here.

25:15.667 --> 25:17.208
When do you want to start?

25:17.291 --> 25:19.542
Well, the contest is...
it's really soon,

25:19.625 --> 25:22.458
so I was kind of hoping
for, like, today.

25:22.500 --> 25:23.583
Great.

25:23.667 --> 25:24.583
Give me a couple hours.

25:24.667 --> 25:26.333
Uh, we have someplace
we need to be.

25:26.417 --> 25:27.417
Hey, bambino!

25:27.500 --> 25:29.125
Grab your coat, let's go!

25:29.166 --> 25:29.959
No hurry.

25:30.041 --> 25:30.959
Whenever you're ready.

25:31.083 --> 25:33.166
Thanks. So, see you
in a couple hours?

25:35.000 --> 25:36.458
Great, I'll grab my stuff,
and I'll be back.

25:36.542 --> 25:37.417
Great.

25:37.500 --> 25:38.500
Come on, buddy.

25:38.583 --> 25:39.500
Bye.

25:39.583 --> 25:40.458
Have fun!

25:50.166 --> 25:53.125
Oh, wow, Nick,
this kitchen is amazing.

25:53.166 --> 25:55.291
It's all right.

25:55.333 --> 25:57.583
You remember Ralphie.

25:57.667 --> 25:58.792
Ralphie!

25:58.834 --> 25:59.709
Oh, my goodness!

25:59.792 --> 26:00.625
Hi!

26:00.667 --> 26:02.792
You're still here.

26:02.834 --> 26:04.583
And you look exactly the same.

26:04.667 --> 26:06.750
Oh, honey,
that's not a compliment.

26:06.834 --> 26:08.792
You have only grown more lovely.

26:08.875 --> 26:10.583
That's a compliment.

26:10.667 --> 26:12.125
Oh, and I hear you made it

26:12.208 --> 26:13.875
into that baking contest
up at the Helen Inn.

26:13.959 --> 26:14.834
You know about it?

26:14.875 --> 26:16.041
Know about it?

26:16.250 --> 26:17.959
I've been going to that contest
for the last ten years.

26:18.041 --> 26:20.333
You need any ideas,
I'm your man.

26:20.375 --> 26:21.375
Okay.

26:23.625 --> 26:25.333
All right, this
dough counter work?

26:25.417 --> 26:26.500
Oh, this is perfect.

26:26.583 --> 26:27.583
Well...

26:27.667 --> 26:28.500
back to work.

26:28.542 --> 26:29.917
Nick?

26:30.000 --> 26:30.959
Thank you so much

26:31.041 --> 26:32.750
for bringing me back
into this world.

26:32.834 --> 26:35.333
Let's see
how your enthusiasm holds up

26:35.417 --> 26:36.458
when your gingerbread house

26:36.542 --> 26:38.125
gets disqualified
for bite marks.

26:38.208 --> 26:41.583
Ralphie here
is quite the snacker.

26:42.667 --> 26:44.500
What? Hey!

26:44.583 --> 26:45.875
You talking about me?

26:45.959 --> 26:47.041
Hey, Nick...

26:49.000 --> 26:51.125
[Nick]:
No, no, she's fantastic.

26:51.208 --> 26:54.417
No, she taught Bobby
how to make a hockey stop.

26:54.500 --> 26:56.000
Yeah, seriously.

26:56.083 --> 26:58.542
She's sweet,
she's good with Bobby,

26:58.625 --> 27:01.583
but it's like I said.

27:01.667 --> 27:03.500
All right, you'll
tell her for me, man?

27:03.583 --> 27:05.917
You're the best.

27:06.000 --> 27:10.208
Well, she is not the one.

27:10.291 --> 27:11.083
Who?

27:11.166 --> 27:13.208
Uh, that girl from earlier.

27:13.250 --> 27:16.875
She did not make
the Nick Mazzanti cut.

27:16.959 --> 27:18.875
That's too bad.
She seemed nice.

27:18.959 --> 27:21.792
Yeah, but she has
no babysitting experience.

27:21.875 --> 27:23.041
You know, it's a short-term gig

27:23.083 --> 27:24.625
to help me out
over the holidays,

27:24.709 --> 27:26.750
but everyone the babysitting
agency sends me

27:26.792 --> 27:28.250
has no experience.

27:28.291 --> 27:29.834
[Ralphie] What do you
need a babysitter for?

27:29.917 --> 27:30.834
Carlos is with him right now,

27:30.917 --> 27:32.834
teaching him
how to make ravioli.

27:32.917 --> 27:34.917
That's a very
important life skill.

27:34.959 --> 27:36.250
I don't mind
keeping an eye on him

27:36.291 --> 27:37.458
back there.

27:37.542 --> 27:38.792
You're very kind, Kylie,

27:38.875 --> 27:40.375
but no, a kitchen's
no place for a kid.

27:40.458 --> 27:41.750
How about we ask my wife?

27:41.834 --> 27:43.041
Celeste?

27:43.166 --> 27:45.291
She's been dealing with kids
all year at the high school.

27:45.375 --> 27:47.417
I'm sure she wants
a Christmas break.

27:47.458 --> 27:48.166
Nah, nah, nah,

27:48.291 --> 27:49.750
she's bored out of her mind.

27:49.792 --> 27:50.583
Besides,

27:50.667 --> 27:52.583
whenever she's off work
too long,

27:52.625 --> 27:54.875
all she does
is make me to-do lists.

27:54.959 --> 27:55.959
[chuckling]

27:56.041 --> 27:57.417
Well, when you
put it like that...

27:57.458 --> 27:58.041
Thank you.

27:58.125 --> 28:01.917
Oh, I, uh, had an idea

28:01.959 --> 28:03.458
for your entry.

28:03.500 --> 28:04.834
Oh, I'm all ears.

28:04.917 --> 28:07.417
[tapping out

28:08.834 --> 28:11.208
The Empire State Building.

28:11.291 --> 28:13.208
You went through
all that fanfare

28:13.291 --> 28:14.750
for the Empire State Building?

28:14.834 --> 28:16.667
What does that
have to do with Christmas?

28:16.750 --> 28:19.000
You just light it up
red and green.

28:19.083 --> 28:19.917
Nick, do everybody a favor

28:20.000 --> 28:21.834
and get back to your pizzas.

28:21.917 --> 28:23.208
Hey, believe it or not,

28:23.291 --> 28:24.458
I was asking for her opinion.

28:24.500 --> 28:25.667
Oh, my opinion.

28:25.750 --> 28:27.458
Uh, I mean, I like it.

28:27.542 --> 28:28.792
I just think it's a little tall

28:28.834 --> 28:30.625
for something made of,
you know, cookie.

28:30.667 --> 28:31.625
Yeah.

28:31.667 --> 28:32.834
So get some dowels.

28:32.917 --> 28:35.458
Man, don't you know
anything about these contests?

28:35.542 --> 28:37.291
Everything has to be edible.

28:38.250 --> 28:40.792
So get some of those
supersized candy canes

28:40.875 --> 28:42.625
from the restaurant
supply store.

28:42.667 --> 28:45.500
Solder them together
with a blowtorch.

28:45.542 --> 28:46.417
That's a good idea.

28:46.500 --> 28:47.834
See?

28:47.917 --> 28:49.834
I am known to have them
from time to time.

28:49.917 --> 28:50.917
Yeah, you know what,

28:51.041 --> 28:51.875
if I'm working with
something that strong,

28:51.959 --> 28:53.458
I could even go bigger.

28:53.542 --> 28:55.166
The Golden Gate Bridge.

28:55.250 --> 28:57.834
Yes, we could use rope licorice
for the wires.

28:57.875 --> 28:59.500
And there's nothing
more Christmassy

28:59.583 --> 29:01.792
than the Golden Gate bridge.

29:01.875 --> 29:03.667
Okay, so if you're
such the expert,

29:03.709 --> 29:05.125
what's your big suggestion?

29:05.208 --> 29:06.625
Okay, well, let me see, um...

29:06.709 --> 29:09.375
How about...

- Mm-hmm.

I like that.

29:15.583 --> 29:17.000
Yeah.

29:17.041 --> 29:18.000
Yeah, and I could do
a big clock tower

29:18.166 --> 29:19.291
if I find those
giant candy canes...

29:20.458 --> 29:21.125
Oh, but you know what,

29:21.250 --> 29:23.000
when Chez Phillipe closed,

29:23.041 --> 29:25.917
I lost my membership
to the restaurant supply place.

29:26.000 --> 29:26.792
Maybe I can find them online.

29:26.875 --> 29:28.083
Nah, don't do that.

29:28.166 --> 29:29.959
We make a run on Saturdays.

29:30.041 --> 29:31.917
As in...
Saturday-tomorrow?

29:32.000 --> 29:32.959
Yeah, I can
make sure you get in.

29:33.041 --> 29:35.542
I mean, unless you're busy.

29:35.625 --> 29:37.959
No, that'd be great.
Yeah...

If I were a betting man,

29:47.208 --> 29:48.750
I'd say that sounded
like a date.

29:48.834 --> 29:50.709
And if I were a betting woman,

29:50.792 --> 29:53.417
I'd say that sounded
like a shopping trip.

when his mom passed,

32:42.125 --> 32:44.208
and if Nick hadn't
picked up the slack,

32:44.291 --> 32:45.750
his family would have
lost everything.

32:45.792 --> 32:50.291
I didn't want to be responsible
for pulling him away

32:50.375 --> 32:52.875
when his family needed him.

32:54.792 --> 32:55.792
That's why you left.

32:58.333 --> 33:00.125
I'm sorry.

33:00.208 --> 33:01.417
I had no idea.

33:03.542 --> 33:04.875
But...

33:04.959 --> 33:06.041
you did move back into town.

33:06.125 --> 33:07.291
You could've looked him up.

33:07.375 --> 33:09.083
Not really.

33:09.166 --> 33:10.417
He was married, he had a kid.

33:10.500 --> 33:13.625
I... I didn't want
to rock the boat.

33:13.709 --> 33:15.291
And by the time
I heard he was divorced,

33:15.375 --> 33:17.500
I was dating Alex.

33:17.583 --> 33:19.000
Hmm...

33:19.083 --> 33:22.291

I'm sorry, but your sled dog
is a little tired.

33:40.834 --> 33:42.417
It's kind of early for me.

33:42.500 --> 33:44.166
Where is Ralphie
with those coffees?

33:44.250 --> 33:46.500
The donut shop
is right over there.

33:46.583 --> 33:47.959
On Saturdays,
they put out samples.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.166
It could be a while.

33:50.250 --> 33:52.000
I see.

33:52.083 --> 33:53.166
Well, since we have a minute,

33:53.250 --> 33:54.291
hey, do you want to talk
about your list?

33:54.333 --> 33:57.959
We could, but
there was only one thing

33:58.000 --> 34:00.875
that made me think of Christmas.

34:04.250 --> 34:05.625
Soccer balls?

34:05.709 --> 34:06.458
Yeah.

34:06.667 --> 34:08.041
Every year,
my dad gets me a new one.

34:08.125 --> 34:09.166
Nothing wrong with that, right?

34:09.333 --> 34:12.125
I mean, we all have
different traditions.

34:12.208 --> 34:13.583
So we'll do
soccer ball cupcakes?

34:13.667 --> 34:15.792
Well, why don't we
think about it a little bit?

34:15.875 --> 34:18.333
You know, when you were
making this list, did you...

34:18.417 --> 34:21.083
I don't know, did you happen
to think of, uh...

34:21.166 --> 34:22.792
Did any Christmas ornaments
come to mind?

34:22.875 --> 34:24.250
Or Christmas decorations?

34:24.333 --> 34:25.625
We didn't put any up this year.

34:25.708 --> 34:27.083
What about the ones on the tree?

34:27.166 --> 34:28.792
We have a tree
at my mom's house.

34:30.250 --> 34:31.125
It's not like that.

34:31.208 --> 34:32.000
My dad's great,

34:32.083 --> 34:33.333
he just...

34:33.375 --> 34:35.833
doesn't have time
for all that stuff this year.

34:35.875 --> 34:36.792
When he's home,

34:36.875 --> 34:38.667
he has to clean, shop,

34:38.750 --> 34:39.500
fix stuff,

34:39.542 --> 34:41.291
and help me with my homework.

34:41.375 --> 34:42.417
Yeah, but I bet

34:42.542 --> 34:44.166
he still tries to make
Christmas special for you

34:44.208 --> 34:45.208
in any way we can, right?

34:45.333 --> 34:47.667

soccer ball every year?

34:48.833 --> 34:49.833
You know what,

I'm not gonna let you go to that
party empty-handed, okay?

34:51.875 --> 34:52.875
We are gonna make you

touching the peppermint one.

to focus on the contest.

Oh, I know.

35:50.875 --> 35:52.417
Ugh, if I could just
win that prize money,

never stopped you before.

36:32.458 --> 36:34.834
You just got out of
a pretty bad breakup,

slow your roll a little.

doing some research

37:39.750 --> 37:40.792
into the contest.

37:40.875 --> 37:42.542
It gets quite a bit
of media attention.

37:42.583 --> 37:45.333
That kind of publicity
would be great for Hawkey Homes.

37:45.417 --> 37:46.834

four semifinalists, right?

37:48.959 --> 37:50.291
I'm sure all of them

37:50.375 --> 37:52.542
have big corporate sponsorship.

37:52.625 --> 37:53.750
You're an employee.

37:53.917 --> 37:56.041
It would make sense for
Hawkey Homes to sponsor you.

37:56.125 --> 37:57.875
Well, how would that work?

37:57.959 --> 37:58.709
It's easy.

37:58.959 --> 38:00.166
You just wear
a Hawkey Homes apron,

38:00.250 --> 38:01.917
I'll pay for all your materials,

38:02.000 --> 38:04.333
and you can use the kitchen
in the new model home.

38:04.417 --> 38:05.792

the marble countertops,

view of the lake?

have a tree yet...

39:55.500 --> 39:57.041
Okay, look.

39:57.125 --> 39:58.625
you've taken
an interest in Bobby,

39:58.709 --> 40:00.041

40:00.125 --> 40:02.000
to get this whole
single dad thing down.

every "I" or cross every "t,"

40:10.417 --> 40:11.583

in any way.

back to the lot.

that doesn't get me
any holiday spirit points?

49:37.166 --> 49:38.709
It's a gas fireplace.

49:38.792 --> 49:41.208
I don't think that counts
for holiday spirit points.

49:41.291 --> 49:42.125
[laughs]

49:42.166 --> 49:43.125
What is that smell?

49:43.208 --> 49:44.250
Cupcakes.

49:44.333 --> 49:46.417
No, no, no, the other smell.

49:46.500 --> 49:48.125
Um... oh,
it'll burn off.

49:48.208 --> 49:49.083
But what is it?

49:49.166 --> 49:50.041
Um...

49:50.125 --> 49:50.959
it's...

49:51.041 --> 49:52.125
oven dust.

49:52.208 --> 49:53.291
[smirking]

49:53.333 --> 49:54.667
Because you never cook.

49:54.750 --> 49:56.208
Not true.

49:56.291 --> 49:58.792
I am well known
for reheating my food

49:58.875 --> 49:59.709
in the microwave.

50:01.750 --> 50:02.583
Huh?

50:02.834 --> 50:04.792
Want me to stop
bringing you veal parmesan?

50:04.875 --> 50:05.834
Huh?
[Bobby shouting]

50:05.917 --> 50:06.625
You want me to make

50:06.875 --> 50:09.083
broccoli casserole instead, huh?

50:09.125 --> 50:10.250
No!

50:10.333 --> 50:12.625
No! Put me down!

50:12.709 --> 50:13.667
Kylie!

50:13.709 --> 50:14.542
[laughing]

50:14.834 --> 50:16.917
What? His broccoli casserole
is 99% broccoli.

50:17.000 --> 50:17.959
It's pretty delicious.

50:18.041 --> 50:18.709
Gross!

50:18.875 --> 50:20.041
Yeah, and you can follow it up

50:20.125 --> 50:21.834
with your famous
cauliflower pudding?

50:21.875 --> 50:22.667
- Mmm...
- Yuck.

50:22.709 --> 50:23.500
All right, enough of this.

50:23.583 --> 50:25.542
Let's see these cupcakes

50:25.625 --> 50:27.834
that ruined my
oven dust collection.

50:27.917 --> 50:29.417
I made them all by myself.

50:29.500 --> 50:30.333
All by yourself?

50:30.375 --> 50:31.583
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh yeah?

50:31.667 --> 50:33.834
Well, how about we consult...

50:33.917 --> 50:36.166
the tickle of truth?

50:36.250 --> 50:37.458
[Nick roaring playfully,
Bobby laughing]

50:37.542 --> 50:39.834
Okay, okay, Kylie helped!

50:39.917 --> 50:41.750
[laughing] Kylie helped!

50:41.834 --> 50:42.959
Oh, yeah, she helped?

50:43.041 --> 50:44.250
You know she's here
to help me, right?

50:44.333 --> 50:46.166
But you finished the tree.

50:46.250 --> 50:47.250
It's my turn now.

50:47.333 --> 50:49.500
Almost finished.

50:49.542 --> 50:50.792
There's one more thing

50:50.875 --> 50:52.542
we want to put on it,

50:52.583 --> 50:53.834
and I think I know where it is.

50:57.750 --> 50:59.166
Okay...

50:59.250 --> 51:01.709
Watch your step here.

51:01.750 --> 51:03.333
I should really
get a storage space

51:03.417 --> 51:05.000
for all this stuff.

51:05.083 --> 51:05.875
What do you mean?

51:06.166 --> 51:06.917
It's not like you have
a jet-ski in here.

51:07.000 --> 51:08.500
No, I keep that out back

51:08.583 --> 51:10.041
with the RV
and the monster truck.

51:10.083 --> 51:11.667
[laughs]

51:13.417 --> 51:15.166
I've missed you, Nick.

51:15.250 --> 51:16.709
Ditto.

51:17.458 --> 51:18.834
But you know
what I've missed more?

51:19.875 --> 51:20.709
Beating you.

51:21.542 --> 51:23.208
Yeah.
Watch and learn.

beginner's luck.

51:38.375 --> 51:40.333
Let's take this as a sign
to grab the angel,

51:40.417 --> 51:41.667
okay?

51:41.750 --> 51:42.875
Here we go.

51:44.083 --> 51:45.709
- Do you want my help?
- Please.

51:46.625 --> 51:48.041
Just grab that end right there.

51:58.166 --> 51:59.125
See?

51:59.208 --> 52:02.250
I'm not as hopeless
in the Christmas department

52:02.333 --> 52:03.208
as you maybe thought.

52:03.291 --> 52:04.959
- [chuckling]

52:05.041 --> 52:07.709
I'm upping my Christmas game.

52:13.709 --> 52:15.458
What's this?
This is so pretty.

52:15.500 --> 52:16.375
Don't worry about that.

52:16.458 --> 52:17.417
Oh, come on, what is it?

52:17.500 --> 52:18.375
I can't open that.

52:18.458 --> 52:20.417
It'll destroy your image of me.

52:20.500 --> 52:21.333
Which is...

52:21.417 --> 52:23.250
Utterly unsentimental.

52:23.333 --> 52:25.125
Do you think
I would make fun of you?

52:25.166 --> 52:26.083
In a heartbeat.

52:26.417 --> 52:27.875
Okay, then I definitely
need to see what this is.

52:30.250 --> 52:31.250
Okay.

52:34.834 --> 52:37.208
Nick, this is so pretty.

Why wouldn't you want
to set this out?

52:38.834 --> 52:40.625
I don't know.

52:40.709 --> 52:43.125
I got it a few months
after my mom passed.

52:43.166 --> 52:44.166
That was a rough time.

52:45.083 --> 52:46.458
I mean, you were
finishing school

52:46.500 --> 52:49.166
and managing the restaurant.

52:49.208 --> 52:51.291
You grew up fast, huh?

52:52.750 --> 52:56.458
Do you remember that one day
right before the holidays,

52:56.542 --> 52:58.333
we snuck out of school

52:58.417 --> 52:59.959
and went to that kids'
Christmas fair?

53:00.041 --> 53:01.750
[laughing] Yes, the one
that they kicked us out of?

53:02.709 --> 53:04.583
We really were
too big for those rides.

53:04.667 --> 53:06.000
Not all of them.

53:06.083 --> 53:07.333
[laughs]

53:09.959 --> 53:12.125
Oh, the carousel.

53:12.208 --> 53:14.000
Yeah.

53:14.041 --> 53:16.000
Yeah, we did go on that...

53:16.083 --> 53:18.041
that merry-go-round.

53:18.125 --> 53:19.625
We didn't just ride it.

53:22.333 --> 53:23.834
We had our first kiss there.

53:28.625 --> 53:30.500
You know, I never
really understood

53:30.542 --> 53:32.000
why you took me there.

53:34.542 --> 53:37.291
I think I just thought
maybe you needed to...

53:38.375 --> 53:40.458
feel like a kid.

53:40.542 --> 53:42.542
You know, just...

53:42.583 --> 53:44.333
just for a minute.

53:44.417 --> 53:46.375
No one understood that
except you.

53:48.166 --> 53:49.041
I tried.

53:49.125 --> 53:50.291
You did.

53:52.250 --> 53:54.250
You still do.

54:03.959 --> 54:06.542
I ruined it!

Uh, Nick, those are
his cupcakes.

to wait to ice them,

54:15.291 --> 54:17.417
but they weren't that hot.

54:17.500 --> 54:20.083
But then the icing...

54:20.125 --> 54:22.333
Can we make more?

54:22.417 --> 54:24.667
I don't know
if we have time, buddy.

54:24.750 --> 54:27.917
The party starts soon.

54:27.959 --> 54:28.709

we can stop by the store,

54:30.291 --> 54:31.083
pick some up,

54:31.166 --> 54:33.500
take the wrapper off,

54:33.583 --> 54:35.208
and then we all take
a blood oath

54:35.291 --> 54:37.333
of eternal silence, okay?

[chuckling]

54:39.083 --> 54:39.792
You know what, Bobby,

54:40.000 --> 54:41.083
I think we can salvage this.

Are you sure?

In the kitchen, this is
what we call a "do over."

Uh, in the kitchen,

54:45.667 --> 54:47.458
I've also heard you
say things like

54:47.542 --> 54:48.500
"work with what you got."

54:48.583 --> 54:49.917
Which is what?

54:50.000 --> 54:55.291
Well, we've got an army
of marzipan snowmen,

54:55.375 --> 54:57.542

asked you out on?

borrow your lip balm

59:12.667 --> 59:13.625

practically an invitation

59:13.709 --> 59:14.875

That's news to me.

strange to think

59:31.083 --> 59:34.000
that there was a time
when my biggest worry

59:34.083 --> 59:36.583
was asking a girl out on a date.

While I am not from here,

01:06:36.250 --> 01:06:39.083
I know how important
this contest is to Helen,

01:06:39.166 --> 01:06:41.667
so instead of working
independently,

01:06:41.709 --> 01:06:44.834
I've teamed up with
a local business as my sponsor.

01:06:46.083 --> 01:06:47.458
I am entering

01:06:47.542 --> 01:06:50.291
as Team Hawkey Homes!

01:06:50.375 --> 01:06:52.750
[applause and cheers]

01:06:59.583 --> 01:07:01.291
[gasps in disbelief]

01:07:01.375 --> 01:07:03.542
Okay, now you can worry.

01:07:10.333 --> 01:07:11.417
I've heard of guys
doing crazy things

01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:12.667
to get back at their exes,

01:07:12.750 --> 01:07:14.291
but this takes the cake.

01:07:14.375 --> 01:07:17.250
Sponsoring the grandmother
of gingerbread?

01:07:17.333 --> 01:07:18.375
The "godmother."

01:07:18.458 --> 01:07:19.959
But you know what,
I like "grandmother" better.

01:07:20.667 --> 01:07:22.542
Is that edible stained glass?

01:07:22.625 --> 01:07:23.625
Yeah, you know,
if there's one thing

01:07:23.709 --> 01:07:24.750
I learned from
this press conference,

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.375
it's that I've got to up my game
if I want to win.

01:07:26.458 --> 01:07:27.667
And I have to win.

01:07:27.750 --> 01:07:29.542
Look, if you put all
of your eggs in one basket...

01:07:29.583 --> 01:07:31.709
Yeah, but Tina,
what other basket do I have?

01:07:31.792 --> 01:07:33.625
I mean,
I've spent the last five days

01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:35.583
living the most wonderful dream,

01:07:35.667 --> 01:07:37.417
and I-I'm terrified
that I'm gonna wake up,

01:07:37.458 --> 01:07:39.583
and it's all gonna go back
to the way things were.

01:07:40.667 --> 01:07:42.375
Do you really think
you feel like this

01:07:42.458 --> 01:07:45.250
just because of a contest?

01:07:47.333 --> 01:07:49.709
You're right.

01:07:49.792 --> 01:07:51.750
I just never thought that...

01:07:51.792 --> 01:07:55.792
hanging out with Nick
would bring up all these...

01:07:55.875 --> 01:07:58.750
these feelings
that I tried to bury.

01:08:00.583 --> 01:08:01.959
I have to tell him, don't I?

01:08:02.875 --> 01:08:03.709
Yeah.

01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:07.208
Um, don't tell him in a text.

01:08:07.291 --> 01:08:08.709
I'm not,

01:08:08.792 --> 01:08:11.709
I'm just asking if he has time
to talk tonight.

01:08:13.125 --> 01:08:14.709
Yeah.

01:08:20.542 --> 01:08:22.207
Kylie...

01:08:22.291 --> 01:08:24.457
I have two pieces of good news.

01:08:24.542 --> 01:08:26.750
First of all, Bobby's
teacher e-mailed me.

01:08:26.834 --> 01:08:27.917
The cupcakes were such a hit,

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:28.834
she wants him to come in

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.457
and do a demo
for Valentines day.

01:08:30.542 --> 01:08:32.709
That's great!
What's the other news?

01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:34.959
Just a little something
to say thank you.

01:08:35.041 --> 01:08:37.082
Aw...

01:08:38.959 --> 01:08:40.125
It's... tickets

01:08:40.166 --> 01:08:42.207
to the competition.

01:08:42.291 --> 01:08:44.125
My Christmas bonus came early.

01:08:45.709 --> 01:08:47.792
But there's, like,
ten of them here.

01:08:47.875 --> 01:08:50.792
Yeah, I got one for me,
for Bobby, for Ralphie,

01:08:50.875 --> 01:08:51.917
the kitchen staff...

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.291
Nick, that's really sweet,

01:08:53.375 --> 01:08:54.375
but I...

01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:56.000
I don't know if I want
all those people there.

01:08:56.082 --> 01:08:57.332
What?

01:08:57.417 --> 01:08:58.792
Why not?

01:08:59.750 --> 01:09:01.291
I just don't want to drag
everybody out there

01:09:01.375 --> 01:09:03.207
to watch me lose.

01:09:03.291 --> 01:09:04.625
I'm just feeling overwhelmed.

01:09:04.709 --> 01:09:06.457
Can we just dial back
the pressure a little, please?

01:09:06.542 --> 01:09:07.667
Yeah, yeah.

01:09:07.750 --> 01:09:10.207
Um, I'll... tell
the kitchen staff not to come,

01:09:10.291 --> 01:09:12.917
but honestly, I really think
you could...

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:13.834
Whoa!

01:09:13.875 --> 01:09:15.332
What happened
to Santa's Village?

01:09:15.417 --> 01:09:18.000
Oh, my nieces thought
it was delicious, but...

01:09:18.041 --> 01:09:18.875
I don't know, Nick,

01:09:19.166 --> 01:09:20.500
I just wasn't feeling like
it was enough,

01:09:20.582 --> 01:09:22.166
and with the opponent
that I'm up against,

01:09:22.250 --> 01:09:23.542
I just need that "wow" factor.

01:09:23.625 --> 01:09:25.542
What do you think about this?

01:09:25.625 --> 01:09:28.500
I think it's....

01:09:28.542 --> 01:09:30.457
a perfect imitation

01:09:30.542 --> 01:09:32.166
of someone else's work.

01:09:32.250 --> 01:09:34.332
[sighs]

01:09:34.457 --> 01:09:35.709
You don't understand.

01:09:35.792 --> 01:09:37.542
I mean, Ina's my competitor.

01:09:37.582 --> 01:09:40.709
I-I have to... I have to
get into her shoes,

01:09:40.792 --> 01:09:42.041
I have to think,
"What would Ina do?"

01:09:42.125 --> 01:09:43.207
Really?

01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:45.750
Well, I'm more interested in
"What would Kylie Watson do?"

01:09:45.834 --> 01:09:46.917
And that's a nice thought,

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.041
but you don't understand
the pressure I'm under.

01:09:50.250 --> 01:09:52.457
Kylie...

01:09:52.542 --> 01:09:55.208
I've known you your entire life.

01:09:55.291 --> 01:09:57.041
I get you.

01:09:57.125 --> 01:09:58.291
[sighs]

01:09:58.375 --> 01:10:00.208
I get that you can
make Christmas

01:10:00.250 --> 01:10:01.750
out of a pool
of melted frosting.

01:10:02.959 --> 01:10:05.375
I get that you can make
people feel something

01:10:05.417 --> 01:10:06.375
with what you make.

01:10:06.458 --> 01:10:08.166
You just need
to trust your talent.

01:10:08.250 --> 01:10:09.333
What you don't get is

01:10:10.750 --> 01:10:12.291
I mean, everything
is at stake here.

01:10:13.375 --> 01:10:15.000
You're right.

01:10:15.083 --> 01:10:16.959
I don't get it.

01:10:17.041 --> 01:10:18.834
You sent me a text?

01:10:18.917 --> 01:10:20.375
You wanted to talk to me
about something?

01:10:21.333 --> 01:10:22.291
I...

01:10:23.917 --> 01:10:25.709
I can't.

01:10:25.792 --> 01:10:26.834
Don't worry about it.

01:10:31.625 --> 01:10:32.875
What did I say?

01:10:33.917 --> 01:10:36.000
Why don't we talk about it
in my office?

01:10:41.583 --> 01:10:43.041
Why do I feel like I'm a kid

01:10:43.125 --> 01:10:45.125
who's being called into
the principal's office?

01:10:45.208 --> 01:10:48.375
That's because you are.

01:10:48.458 --> 01:10:50.583
Listen, um,

01:10:50.625 --> 01:10:52.667
before your dad died,

01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:55.625
he asked me to look after you.

01:10:55.667 --> 01:10:57.125
Well, I don't need
looking after.

01:10:57.208 --> 01:10:58.291
I'm a grown man, man.

01:10:58.333 --> 01:10:59.291
I got work to do.

01:10:59.333 --> 01:11:00.250
Okay, well, just..

01:11:00.333 --> 01:11:02.625
just answer me one question.

01:11:02.709 --> 01:11:04.208
Make it a fast one.

01:11:05.417 --> 01:11:06.583
Why are you giving Kylie
such a hard time

01:11:06.667 --> 01:11:08.125
about the contest?

01:11:09.792 --> 01:11:12.125
I want her to trust her talent.

01:11:14.041 --> 01:11:15.500
I don't want this
to end badly for her.

01:11:15.583 --> 01:11:16.500
Okay.

01:11:16.583 --> 01:11:17.625
Well, how about
you clarify something...

01:11:17.709 --> 01:11:18.542
That's two questions.

01:11:18.625 --> 01:11:19.750
All right...

01:11:20.583 --> 01:11:21.792
I think you're anxious.

01:11:21.834 --> 01:11:23.458
I think you're scared

01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:25.083
that once the contest is over,

01:11:25.166 --> 01:11:26.583
you won't see Kylie again.

01:11:26.667 --> 01:11:27.458
Aw, come on, man...

01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:29.458
No, no, you come on.

01:11:29.542 --> 01:11:30.917
Man, you're crazy about her!

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:35.458
I can see it in your face
every time you say her name.

01:11:35.542 --> 01:11:37.417
You want me to take a poll
of the kitchen staff?

01:11:40.375 --> 01:11:41.542
What are you waiting for?

01:11:41.625 --> 01:11:42.792
Tell her.

01:11:46.875 --> 01:11:50.333
I've wanted to, like,
a hundred times.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.041
I just, I don't want
to be that guy.

01:11:54.125 --> 01:11:55.333
What guy?

01:11:55.375 --> 01:11:57.667
That guy who thinks

01:11:57.750 --> 01:12:00.333
"This time
it's gonna be different."

01:12:00.375 --> 01:12:02.417
Are you kidding me?

01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:03.959
If people didn't think

01:12:04.041 --> 01:12:05.333
"This time
it's gonna be different,"

01:12:05.417 --> 01:12:06.834
they would never go on a date.

01:12:06.917 --> 01:12:09.458
You can call my wife
and ask her.

01:12:09.542 --> 01:12:11.500
Our whole marriage
is based upon those words.

01:12:11.583 --> 01:12:13.333
Those words should be engraved

01:12:13.375 --> 01:12:15.208
in schools and churches.

01:12:15.333 --> 01:12:16.458
Why?

01:12:16.542 --> 01:12:18.375
So we can get people's hopes up?

01:12:18.458 --> 01:12:19.333
[chuckles]

01:12:24.125 --> 01:12:25.208
Yeah.

01:12:25.291 --> 01:12:26.917
Yeah, man.

01:12:30.250 --> 01:12:32.709
[cell phone rings]

01:12:32.792 --> 01:12:34.375
Hi, it's Nick.

01:12:34.417 --> 01:12:35.709
Leave a message.

01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:38.333
[voicemail beeps]

01:12:38.417 --> 01:12:40.625
Nick...

01:12:40.709 --> 01:12:42.041
listen, I'm up at the Inn,

01:12:42.083 --> 01:12:44.875
and I've been thinking
about this contest,

01:12:44.959 --> 01:12:47.542
and how crazy
it's getting, and...

01:12:47.583 --> 01:12:50.834
I just have to face the facts.

01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:52.959
I think I was so excited

01:12:53.041 --> 01:12:54.750
to be spending time
with you again,

01:12:54.834 --> 01:12:59.500
that I actually convinced myself
that I could win,

01:12:59.583 --> 01:13:01.166
and...

01:13:01.959 --> 01:13:03.625
it's nothing you did,

01:13:03.709 --> 01:13:06.166
it-it's just me, but...

01:13:06.250 --> 01:13:10.208
I think we both know
it wasn't meant to be.

01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:13.291
[sighs sadly]

01:13:16.667 --> 01:13:17.750
[voicemail alert chimes]

01:13:17.834 --> 01:13:18.750
[beep]

01:13:18.792 --> 01:13:20.250
Nick, listen, I'm up at the Inn,

01:13:20.333 --> 01:13:22.500
and I've been thinking
about this contest,

01:13:22.583 --> 01:13:23.625
and how crazy it's getting,

01:13:23.709 --> 01:13:24.709
and I just have
to face the facts.

01:13:24.792 --> 01:13:25.709
I think I was so excited...

01:13:25.792 --> 01:13:26.917
[clicks phone off]

01:13:26.959 --> 01:13:29.750
[distant voices murmuring]

01:13:29.834 --> 01:13:31.458
...a little
to the right.

01:13:39.667 --> 01:13:41.959
[Alex]: A little
to the left...

01:13:42.041 --> 01:13:44.083
A little to the right.

01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:49.417
[Ina]: Alex, you
are over-doing it.

01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:51.917
[Alex]: It has
to be perfect.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.959
[Ina]: You must
trust me, Alex.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.208
I assure you, she will love it.

01:13:57.750 --> 01:13:58.583
Who will love it?

01:14:00.083 --> 01:14:01.250
Kylie...

01:14:01.333 --> 01:14:02.291
What are you doing here?

01:14:02.333 --> 01:14:03.333
What are you doing here?

01:14:03.417 --> 01:14:04.834
Stay away.

01:14:04.917 --> 01:14:06.834
You can't look
inside this booth, please.

01:14:06.917 --> 01:14:10.125
You guys don't have
to be so secretive.

01:14:10.208 --> 01:14:12.583
I'm withdrawing
from the competition.

01:14:15.667 --> 01:14:17.083
But you must come tomorrow.

01:14:17.166 --> 01:14:18.667
Yeah, you'll ruin everything.

01:14:19.709 --> 01:14:21.709
What? I-I thought
you'd be happy.

01:14:21.792 --> 01:14:24.417
I mean, you have an even better
chance of winning now.

01:14:25.667 --> 01:14:27.458
You think I need you to withdraw

01:14:27.542 --> 01:14:28.834
in order to win?

01:14:28.875 --> 01:14:30.417
No, I'm sorry,
that came out wrong.

01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:32.000
I...

01:14:32.083 --> 01:14:33.583
Alex, what is going on here?

01:14:36.875 --> 01:14:41.166
Ina, I need a minute with Kylie?

01:14:41.250 --> 01:14:43.208
Um... alone?

01:14:50.166 --> 01:14:52.917
Alex, will you please tell me
what's going on?

01:14:54.083 --> 01:14:56.041

it's probably not a "yes."

01:16:29.083 --> 01:16:30.625
Alex, this is so impressive,

01:16:30.667 --> 01:16:33.125
but I really hope
you can understand.

01:16:34.375 --> 01:16:36.208
I'm so sorry.

01:16:40.583 --> 01:16:42.208

I had no idea
he was going to do that.

01:17:04.458 --> 01:17:05.166
I-I didn't...

01:17:05.417 --> 01:17:06.625
You didn't exactly
look like a woman

01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:07.709
who was politely declining.

01:17:07.792 --> 01:17:08.792
But I did.

01:17:08.875 --> 01:17:11.166
I did, I told him "no"
the second you left.

01:17:11.250 --> 01:17:13.500
Well, maybe you should
go back in and say "yes."

01:17:13.542 --> 01:17:14.959
Why would I do that, Nick?

01:17:15.041 --> 01:17:15.875
I...

01:17:15.959 --> 01:17:17.792
Nick, I don't want
to be with him.

It was just

01:17:20.834 --> 01:17:22.000

01:17:22.083 --> 01:17:25.542
Yeah, well, that's how
it always is with us.

The reason it ended then
is the reason it's ending now.

01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:41.333
It just wasn't meant to be.

01:17:58.500 --> 01:17:59.709

01:17:59.750 --> 01:18:01.625
Nick!

01:18:01.709 --> 01:18:04.917
Okay, so he's not here.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.375
It doesn't mean anything.

No, Tina,
it does mean something.

He won't pick up the phone.

01:18:12.041 --> 01:18:13.709
He won't return my texts.

01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:15.458
Okay, in the grand
scheme of things,

01:18:15.542 --> 01:18:16.709

01:18:16.792 --> 01:18:18.709
at the sight
of another man proposing

01:18:18.792 --> 01:18:19.959
might be a good thing?

01:18:20.041 --> 01:18:20.917
I don't care

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.333
about the grand scheme
of things, Tina.

forever.

01:18:31.083 --> 01:18:32.959
I don't think I ever stopped
wanting him in my life.

01:18:33.041 --> 01:18:34.875
So tell Nick that.

01:18:34.959 --> 01:18:36.333
But I told him
I don't want Alex.

01:18:36.417 --> 01:18:38.250
Hon, that's not the same thing.

01:18:38.291 --> 01:18:41.792
You need to tell him
how you feel about him.

01:18:41.875 --> 01:18:45.500
Tina, he said
it wasn't meant to be.

01:18:45.583 --> 01:18:48.208
Do you really think if he knew,
it would change things?

01:18:48.291 --> 01:18:50.583
[Tina and Ralphie]: Yes.

01:18:50.667 --> 01:18:51.750
Ralphie!

01:18:51.834 --> 01:18:52.667
Don't "Ralphie" me.

01:18:52.750 --> 01:18:53.917
This is my kitchen.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:54.917
Occasionally, I'm in it.

01:18:54.959 --> 01:18:55.917
Did you just hear...

01:18:55.959 --> 01:18:57.875
Everything.
Mm-hmm.

01:18:57.959 --> 01:18:59.792
Was I eavesdropping?

01:18:59.834 --> 01:19:00.917
Perhaps.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:01.834
But...

01:19:01.917 --> 01:19:04.125
I have a vested interest
in what goes on

01:19:04.166 --> 01:19:06.750
between you
and that knucklehead.

01:19:06.834 --> 01:19:07.667
A.K.A., I care.

01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:10.166
And as a person who cares,

01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:13.458
I happen to agree
with your, uh...

01:19:13.542 --> 01:19:14.291
Oh, sister.

01:19:14.375 --> 01:19:15.750
Sister.
Hey, what's up...

01:19:15.834 --> 01:19:17.792
Who, along with myself,

01:19:17.875 --> 01:19:18.792
seems to have

01:19:19.125 --> 01:19:20.917
a little bit more knowledge
of human nature than you.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.291
And we...
happen to think

01:19:23.333 --> 01:19:26.041
that with a little honesty,

01:19:26.125 --> 01:19:27.542
you two could work things out.

01:19:28.250 --> 01:19:29.917
Yeah, but he's not
listening to words.

01:19:31.709 --> 01:19:34.750
He won't listen to words...

01:19:34.834 --> 01:19:36.667
So I can't...

01:19:36.750 --> 01:19:38.792
If he won't listen to words,
I can't tell him in words.

01:19:41.166 --> 01:19:43.458
Okay, so she's gone
off the deep end,

01:19:43.542 --> 01:19:45.250
and as a relative,
I feel this falls on you.

01:19:45.333 --> 01:19:46.166
What?
No...

01:19:46.208 --> 01:19:47.834
No, I'm not crazy,

01:19:47.875 --> 01:19:50.834
but I have an idea.

01:19:50.875 --> 01:19:52.375
Ky, whatcha doing?

01:19:52.458 --> 01:19:54.792
I know what my contest entry
should be.

01:19:54.875 --> 01:19:55.875
You know, Nick's been saying

01:19:55.959 --> 01:19:57.667
that I've been
focusing on technique,

01:19:57.709 --> 01:19:58.417
and he's right,

01:19:58.583 --> 01:19:59.458
I've been focusing on technique,

01:19:59.709 --> 01:20:01.667
but what I really need to do
is just...

01:20:01.709 --> 01:20:03.792
make something that makes
people feel something!

01:20:05.208 --> 01:20:06.750
Okay, but you do realize

01:20:06.834 --> 01:20:08.000
that they're
judging this contest

01:20:08.041 --> 01:20:10.166
in, like, what, 12 hours?

01:20:10.250 --> 01:20:11.959
Yes, which gives me 12 hours
to make my entry.

01:20:14.291 --> 01:20:15.208
You guys, go.

01:20:15.291 --> 01:20:17.041

I'll be fine.

01:20:23.041 --> 01:20:24.375
could you please make sure

01:20:24.458 --> 01:20:26.291
that Nick and Bobby
come with you tomorrow?

01:20:27.041 --> 01:20:28.000
I'll do my best.

01:20:28.083 --> 01:20:29.125

01:20:29.291 --> 01:20:32.959

the best way I know how.

The Helen-based contest
is in its 25th year,

01:20:38.542 --> 01:20:40.000
and the excitement is building

01:20:40.083 --> 01:20:41.458
as the four semifinalists

01:20:41.542 --> 01:20:44.500

their final score.

Kylie Watson

has still
not revealed her entry.

01:20:56.417 --> 01:20:58.417

the contest deadline.
