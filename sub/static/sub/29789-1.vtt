WEBVTT

00:23.958 --> 00:25.417
In a village of La Mancha

00:25.500 --> 00:27.667
the name of which
I have no desire to call to mind

00:27.750 --> 00:30.333
once lived a man called... Alonso.

00:30.583 --> 00:33.667
This man, was so brainwashed
by Chivalry Books,

00:33.750 --> 00:38.667
that one day, he started to believe
he was a Knight himself.

00:38.750 --> 00:40.250
After cleaning his old armor,

00:40.333 --> 00:44.375
he baptizes his clumsy horse
with the name of Rocinante

00:44.542 --> 00:48.125
and leaves his home,
with the objective to defend his honor

00:48.208 --> 00:51.708
and fight for his made up Damsel...

00:52.000 --> 00:54.250
the most beautiful woman in the world.

00:55.833 --> 00:58.292
Don Quixote
as he wished to be called

00:58.375 --> 01:01.458
entered an old tavern
thinking it was a Castle

01:01.542 --> 01:05.708
and demanded to be named Knight
by the Bar Tender

01:05.792 --> 01:08.792
to everyone's surprise
and laughter.

01:09.583 --> 01:13.375
After getting his honor hurt,
he duels a bunch of merchants

01:13.458 --> 01:15.875
who he seems to confuse with bandits

01:15.958 --> 01:18.333
ending up in a terrible defeat... for him.

01:18.542 --> 01:19.417
Beaten,

01:19.500 --> 01:20.542
he comes back home

01:20.625 --> 01:23.292
and tries to persue
his ignorant neighbor, Sancho

01:23.333 --> 01:26.583
to join him in his adventures

01:26.667 --> 01:30.333
promising him
his very own Island in return.

01:31.125 --> 01:33.125
Sancho, along with Don Quixote

01:33.250 --> 01:38.000
star in one of the most memorable
moments in literature.

01:38.208 --> 01:39.208
Don Quixote,

01:39.250 --> 01:41.708
engages in a fight with numerous giants

01:41.750 --> 01:44.042
who turn out to be
nothing more than windmills

01:44.125 --> 01:46.583
being defeated once again.

01:46.958 --> 01:49.458
Sancho
picks up his friend from the ground,

01:49.583 --> 01:52.125
and together, they sail across the horizon

01:52.250 --> 01:55.083
waiting for more adventures to live.

01:56.667 --> 02:01.792
My story, wow
that's a very big question.

02:02.583 --> 02:06.167
Let's see, well I guess it
all started with this girl,

02:06.292 --> 02:09.083
Chelsey, about three months
ago when I came back from

02:09.125 --> 02:13.500
touring with my band, I decided
I was gonna propose to her,

02:13.750 --> 02:17.042
so I get everything all started,
make some roasted chicken,

02:17.167 --> 02:20.750
set the mood right,
get down on one knee and...

02:21.583 --> 02:25.500
I love you Chelsey,
and I wanna know if...

02:25.583 --> 02:27.667
I cheated on you Connor.

02:29.042 --> 02:32.583
Yeah right, so then
she goes and tells me about

02:32.667 --> 02:35.333
how I've been gone for too
long and how we've been

02:35.417 --> 02:38.167
together since high school
and how she feels like

02:38.208 --> 02:40.583
she's missing out on a part of her life.

02:40.667 --> 02:42.167
And then I ask her...

02:42.250 --> 02:43.333
Who you fucking?

02:43.417 --> 02:44.917
And then there's a knock at the door.

02:45.333 --> 02:47.208
What the fuck now?

02:48.833 --> 02:49.667
Nope.

02:50.458 --> 02:52.542
Say hi to my brother Chelsey.

02:52.708 --> 02:54.958
Let him hear what you just told me.

02:55.208 --> 02:56.417
Listen guys this isn't a good time...

02:56.500 --> 02:58.667
Oh no, now is the perfect time.

02:59.292 --> 03:02.625
Who are you fucking?

03:02.750 --> 03:03.792
Connor.

03:03.958 --> 03:05.542
You see where this is going?

03:07.083 --> 03:11.458
Yep, my brother Henry and
Chelsey are moving in together.

03:11.708 --> 03:13.958
Chelsey and I are moving in together.

03:14.208 --> 03:16.208
And here's the excuse.

03:17.667 --> 03:21.333
We were gonna go to Spain together,
we've been talking about it forever.

03:21.625 --> 03:24.542
We were gonna go to the museums,
visit Barcelona,

03:24.625 --> 03:27.167
have sex on the fucking
Mediterranean after reading

03:27.292 --> 03:29.125
Don Quixote, what happened to that?

03:29.208 --> 03:31.208
I don't like Spain!

03:31.542 --> 03:33.583
I never told you because I
knew how much it meant to you

03:33.625 --> 03:35.958
but honestly I couldn't care less.

03:36.292 --> 03:40.083
I mean I don't even know who
the fuck Don Quixote is or...

03:40.500 --> 03:42.708
Yeah I couldn't place it on
a fucking map if I wanted to.

03:42.792 --> 03:44.750
Yeah well it's right
under France you bitch.

03:44.875 --> 03:45.833
- You know what?
- Cool it.

03:45.875 --> 03:47.500
You can't even speak Spanish.

03:47.625 --> 03:49.792
So stop being such a
spoiled brat and grow some...

03:49.833 --> 03:52.875
Well, I guess
she did have a point there.

03:53.375 --> 03:56.667
So anyway, we start
arguing, nothing serious.

03:56.792 --> 03:58.958
She threatens to call my therapist.

03:59.167 --> 04:01.125
Until the real bomb was dropped.

04:01.208 --> 04:03.792
That's when things got serious.

04:04.458 --> 04:06.292
Mom died last month.

04:12.792 --> 04:15.958
What, why didn't you tell me anything.

04:16.625 --> 04:18.416
You didn't think we tried?

04:18.666 --> 04:22.833
No cellphone no e-mail,
no real way to talk to you at all.

04:24.875 --> 04:28.708
And to be fair, you knew exactly
what she was going through.

04:29.042 --> 04:30.500
All right you knew what
kinda time she had left

04:30.542 --> 04:32.750
before you had to take off and
do whatever the fuck it was

04:32.792 --> 04:34.708
you thought you were doing.

04:41.708 --> 04:44.000
You know you can't run away from this.

04:44.333 --> 04:46.250
You can't just take off, come back,

04:46.333 --> 04:49.125
and expect everything to be
the exact same way all right.

04:49.542 --> 04:51.792
That's not how this is gonna work.

04:54.833 --> 04:55.667
Get out.

04:57.500 --> 04:59.583
There's the fucking door.

05:00.833 --> 05:02.833
This is my place Connor.

05:11.917 --> 05:14.875
That was the bomb that set it all off.

05:15.208 --> 05:20.083
After that, it was all
a big long journey downhill.

05:36.250 --> 05:37.750
Fucking bitch, ah!

05:44.625 --> 05:45.375
Fred.

05:50.583 --> 05:51.667
Fred open up.

05:52.375 --> 05:54.284
Coming, coming.

05:54.417 --> 05:56.500
No need to keep knocking.

06:01.208 --> 06:02.833
What are you doing here?

06:03.557 --> 06:06.167
- Came to talk to you.
- Lies.

06:06.546 --> 06:08.095
Why are you here?

06:08.410 --> 06:10.923
I can't come visit
my dad every now and then?

06:11.958 --> 06:15.456
You're 37 days late Connor, go home.

06:15.937 --> 06:18.033
Hey hold on wait Fred wait!

06:18.330 --> 06:19.121
Fred!

06:20.583 --> 06:24.167
Are you gonna leave me
here feeling like shit huh?

06:25.414 --> 06:26.247
Fuck.

07:19.250 --> 07:20.667
Oh shit, oh shit!

07:37.250 --> 07:38.956
Take it to your room.

09:23.625 --> 09:25.115
How were her last days?

09:30.583 --> 09:31.708
Peaceful.

09:38.583 --> 09:39.713
Look I'm sorry...

09:39.791 --> 09:41.939
The only reason why I let
you stay is, because you

09:41.999 --> 09:44.994
look like shit, but you're
not welcome around here okay.

09:45.042 --> 09:47.342
Not after what you did to your mother.

09:48.877 --> 09:51.627
- I was working!
- Oh come on.

09:51.760 --> 09:53.177
Enough with that!

09:56.999 --> 09:59.881
Your mother asked about you every day.

10:02.887 --> 10:06.850
Not one day went by, without her asking

10:07.006 --> 10:08.779
where her little boy was.

10:10.416 --> 10:16.084
Can you imagine my face,
having to lie to her, every day?

10:18.250 --> 10:23.616
Telling her that you were too busy
just to come visit when she was dying.

10:27.625 --> 10:29.875
I don't wanna see you
around here anymore Connor.

10:59.583 --> 11:05.048
Hey Connor, long time no see,
how you been?

11:05.282 --> 11:06.990
Everything's good man.

11:07.179 --> 11:09.618
How's your lovely girlfriend huh?

11:09.667 --> 11:11.875
How you guys doing, she is great.

11:11.958 --> 11:14.667
Hey, today's my last day in the apartment,

11:14.731 --> 11:17.116
I'm moving in with my wife.

11:17.231 --> 11:21.231
I just got married, huh that's crazy huh?

11:21.302 --> 11:23.903
Hey we should go have a beer
someday, you wanna grab a beer

11:23.958 --> 11:26.292
what are you doing tonight?

11:27.118 --> 11:28.576
Ah, I'll text you.

11:45.122 --> 11:45.913
Hello?

11:47.625 --> 11:49.829
Hey look I'm really sorry...

11:50.708 --> 11:53.470
No, come on,
hey listen come on, let...

11:53.741 --> 11:55.462
No let me come down there,
I wanna talk to you

11:55.515 --> 11:58.470
face to face, please,
just hear me out please.

11:59.444 --> 12:02.053
No, no listen to me okay!

12:02.083 --> 12:06.050
I have been busting my fucking
ass for months at that place,

12:06.083 --> 12:08.796
you can't, hello, hello?

12:17.342 --> 12:18.549
Fuck!

13:02.542 --> 13:04.105
Connor, Connor!

13:04.164 --> 13:07.339
Hey hey hey, spit it out boy,
go go go go!

13:07.437 --> 13:10.445
Spit it out, everything out,
oh, pea soup?

13:16.439 --> 13:20.106
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

13:21.856 --> 13:25.939
Come on, ssshht, it's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

14:28.606 --> 14:31.439
- I see you're awake.
- Yeah, sorry.

14:33.917 --> 14:35.667
Here have some tea.

14:52.147 --> 14:54.048
How are you Connor?

14:54.272 --> 14:56.845
You haven't been answering my calls.

14:57.250 --> 14:59.917
Yeah I know I'm sorry,
I've been working.

15:01.691 --> 15:03.631
By the way who called you?

15:03.795 --> 15:08.378
Your brother, he was afraid
you'd get back to old habits.

15:10.481 --> 15:11.731
I'm so sorry.

15:13.356 --> 15:15.527
I thought I had it under control.

15:16.316 --> 15:20.189
Then three days ago I find
out that my ex is fucking

15:20.238 --> 15:25.046
my brother, my mom's dead,
and my dad blames me for it.

15:25.667 --> 15:29.835
And we are gonna get over
all this negativity soon son,

15:30.522 --> 15:31.689
I promise you.

15:33.625 --> 15:35.679
But what if I don't want to Martha?

15:36.147 --> 15:38.860
What if some people really
don't need to be here?

15:39.875 --> 15:42.282
What if I don't wanna be here anymore.

15:43.685 --> 15:46.685
And miss out future opportunities?

15:47.951 --> 15:51.867
How about Spain, have you
been planning on that?

15:52.449 --> 15:55.578
I did, I wanted to go everywhere.

15:56.660 --> 15:59.201
But it's the same story
with me, and as time goes go on

15:59.272 --> 16:02.389
it just,
I haven't even fucking left L.A.

16:06.772 --> 16:09.585
Look Martha, I really appreciate
everything you've done

16:09.625 --> 16:11.959
for me over the years, I do.

16:13.106 --> 16:15.987
But I don't think this is working
out to be honest with you.

16:16.393 --> 16:19.042
I can't let you go knowing
you're gonna hurt yourself.

16:19.113 --> 16:21.404
Oh, and I lost my job too.

16:21.443 --> 16:22.360
The band?

16:23.267 --> 16:26.011
Oh come on, I know you know.

16:26.942 --> 16:28.777
Quit treating me like I'm stupid.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.625
If you cross that door,
I will have to call the police

16:31.680 --> 16:33.019
you know that.

16:33.399 --> 16:37.149
This is not your office, and
I'm not your patient anymore.

16:37.453 --> 16:40.995
So stop trying to protect me,
I'm sick of this bullshit.

16:46.875 --> 16:48.500
Martha can you open the door please?

16:53.564 --> 16:57.431
Are you? Martha would you
please open the fucking door?

17:12.208 --> 17:13.791
For fuck's sake Martha I have to go,

17:13.833 --> 17:15.833
can you please open the door?

17:15.910 --> 17:19.660
Here, I'll let you go
if you take this with you.

17:20.521 --> 17:22.564
- What is it?
- It's a ring.

17:23.559 --> 17:26.550
It's a technique I use
with my most special friends.

17:29.696 --> 17:33.404
Whenever you feel you're
about to break, put this on,

17:33.500 --> 17:36.478
lay on the ground, and relax.

17:37.738 --> 17:39.488
- You're serious?
- Hmm-mm.

17:39.574 --> 17:44.205
And then, you name
every place you would like to be,

17:44.647 --> 17:47.438
one by one, okay?

17:53.665 --> 17:55.800
I love how you've given up on me.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.208
No thanks.

18:30.458 --> 18:33.208
Hey who the fuck let you in here,
you don't work here anymore.

18:33.250 --> 18:35.667
Come on just give me the keys,
I'll start working right now.

18:35.728 --> 18:38.488
Didn't you hear what I said,
I said you don't work here anymore,

18:38.542 --> 18:39.917
get the fuck out outta here.

18:39.973 --> 18:42.326
It was one day, one fucking day.

18:42.375 --> 18:45.154
No no, don't fucking
talk to me like that.

18:45.311 --> 18:48.270
You missed a day of work,
so now you are fired.

18:48.350 --> 18:49.770
Get the fuck outta here.

18:49.865 --> 18:51.186
Come on just give me the keys,
I'll start working right...

18:51.240 --> 18:53.873
Don't fucking touch me,
look you little shit,

18:53.936 --> 18:56.267
I gave you this job, because
you came in here crying

18:56.333 --> 18:59.064
like the biggest pussy
I've ever seen in my life.

18:59.186 --> 19:00.580
I felt sorry for you.

19:00.627 --> 19:02.142
So I said sure, I'll let
him the clean the shit

19:02.189 --> 19:05.049
out of my toilets, but you
couldn't even do that right.

19:05.186 --> 19:07.686
You didn't show up to work,
you fucked me,

19:07.760 --> 19:11.853
you fucked my business, so
now go fuck yourself okay?

19:13.228 --> 19:15.228
Get the fuck outta here!

19:41.408 --> 19:43.746
How do you like that motherfucker?

19:45.770 --> 19:47.152
- What the fuck?
- Shit!

19:47.246 --> 19:48.496
You motherfucker!

19:49.417 --> 19:52.875
What the fuck do you think
you're doing man?

20:01.270 --> 20:02.686
Hey man!

20:28.061 --> 20:29.645
Damn it.

20:38.061 --> 20:39.645
- Excuse me.
- Shit.

20:41.625 --> 20:43.125
Excuse me, I'd really like
to make it to that

20:43.219 --> 20:45.645
- door before this table...
- Oh God I am so sorry, go ahead.

20:45.708 --> 20:46.792
Yeah, sorry.

20:48.353 --> 20:49.770
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

20:52.083 --> 20:53.459
You're the new neighbor.

20:53.645 --> 20:56.107
Oh, uh, no no.

20:56.228 --> 20:58.478
I just really love
moving furniture around

20:58.542 --> 21:01.357
because it's kinda like my hobby.

21:01.770 --> 21:03.686
Oh okay, well see ya.

21:17.333 --> 21:18.333
Fuck.

22:52.958 --> 22:55.069
- Hey Martha.- Hey Connor.

22:55.511 --> 22:57.011
How are you doing?

22:57.455 --> 23:00.093
I'm doing okay, I'm okay.

23:00.892 --> 23:02.173
Where are you?

23:03.011 --> 23:03.928
I'm uh...

23:09.379 --> 23:11.431
I'm in my house, I'm at home.

23:13.583 --> 23:15.291
Do you have the ring?

23:20.038 --> 23:25.038
- Yeah I have the ring.- Are you wearing it?

23:26.458 --> 23:28.458
No I'm not wearing it.

23:29.775 --> 23:31.442
Why would I be wearing it?

23:33.124 --> 23:35.728
Come on just do this for me.

23:36.228 --> 23:39.041
Try to relax about it the best you can

23:39.166 --> 23:41.490
and think, close your eyes.

23:42.491 --> 23:44.888
Where's the place you would like to be at?

23:45.346 --> 23:47.685
I, I don't know, I don't know.

23:49.166 --> 23:52.749
The Sahara, is that good,
does that work for you?

23:53.667 --> 23:56.328
Okay, so, put the ring on.

23:56.725 --> 23:59.914
Okay you know what, okay,
I'm gonna put the ring on.

24:00.207 --> 24:04.015
Okay, I'm gonna put the ring
on right now, there we go.

24:05.070 --> 24:08.412
The ring is now on, are you happy?

24:08.658 --> 24:10.076
Now...

24:11.392 --> 24:12.420
Hello?

24:49.708 --> 24:52.917
I can't fucking, I can't,
I can't, I can't fucking do it!

24:57.123 --> 24:57.956
Fuck!

24:59.436 --> 25:03.475
Why can't I do it, I can't do it.

25:08.221 --> 25:09.733
Why can't I?

25:42.510 --> 25:43.926
Fuck it, fuck it.

25:47.218 --> 25:50.218
Okay, you know where I'd like to be?

25:52.343 --> 25:53.726
The fucking Sahara.

26:30.375 --> 26:32.250
Shit, what the fuck.

26:38.250 --> 26:39.079
Shit!

26:39.167 --> 26:41.704
What the fuck,
what the fuck, what the...?

26:42.208 --> 26:45.978
- What the hell is that thing?
- Calm down you're way too excited.

26:46.042 --> 26:47.627
Now is not the fine for your bullshit.

26:47.708 --> 26:51.292
This, this thing,
it took me over to the Sahara.

26:51.616 --> 26:53.700
That's an obvious choice.

26:55.333 --> 26:57.269
What, no, no, okay, okay, okay.

26:57.583 --> 26:59.416
Okay okay, let's just say,
let's just say,

26:59.458 --> 27:01.957
in a hypothetical situation,
hypothetical situation

27:02.051 --> 27:05.113
that I believe this, that this
thing actually works right,

27:05.176 --> 27:10.509
right, let's say I go somewhere,
and it starts to like

27:10.588 --> 27:13.978
fuck with my fucking like
atoms or some shit you know,

27:14.083 --> 27:17.150
or what if I go somewhere
and I get there

27:17.220 --> 27:20.470
and I'm missing my arm
or my leg is gone, or...

27:21.792 --> 27:24.125
What if I lose my dick,
I don't wanna lose my dick Martha,

27:24.167 --> 27:25.521
- I don't wanna lose my dick!
- Connor, Connor. Connor look at me,

27:25.593 --> 27:27.326
look at me,
look at me, look at me,

27:27.392 --> 27:28.933
and breathe.

27:39.945 --> 27:44.350
The ring is just helping you get
out of the world for a little bit.

27:45.390 --> 27:47.343
Enjoy.

27:49.608 --> 27:53.484
It's gotta be something
you know, like in those fucking

27:53.875 --> 27:56.484
Adam Sandler movies,
what's the catch.

27:56.653 --> 28:00.984
There is no catch,
everything is fine, trust me.

28:03.362 --> 28:08.003
I have only one condition
for you, one condition.

28:09.066 --> 28:13.417
Don't go to the same place twice.

28:14.862 --> 28:18.612
Try to see as much
as you possibly can, okay?

28:22.112 --> 28:23.283
Okay.

28:23.737 --> 28:26.903
Okay, to the world, go.

28:28.383 --> 28:29.133
Vegas!

28:40.166 --> 28:42.916
He rocks in the tree tops all day long.

The wise old owl, the big black crow

at the bird-band stand

29:44.249 --> 29:46.999
Told them how to do
the bob and it was grand

29:47.082 --> 29:49.874
They started going
steady and bless my soul

29:49.957 --> 29:52.866
He out-bopped the buzzard and the oriole

29:52.916 --> 29:55.655
He rocks in the tree tops all day long

29:55.750 --> 29:58.458

raven at the bird-band stand

30:17.957 --> 30:20.697
Told them how to do

30:20.791 --> 30:23.510
They started going

31:12.082 --> 31:12.916
Okay!

31:14.125 --> 31:14.916
Okay!

31:24.250 --> 31:25.666
Let's do this.

31:28.330 --> 31:29.163
Madrid.

33:03.741 --> 33:05.952
- What do you do?
- Shit sorry, uhm.

33:06.104 --> 33:07.538
Sorry, sorry.

33:10.773 --> 33:11.773
You...

33:13.325 --> 33:15.177
Drawings, no wait no.

33:18.083 --> 33:23.416
I like what you paint,

33:23.747 --> 33:25.723
much, pretty much.

33:33.697 --> 33:34.697
Very.

33:35.390 --> 33:36.223
What?

33:37.207 --> 33:39.274
Very pretty, not much pretty.

33:39.500 --> 33:41.727
Oh, got it, right.

33:43.875 --> 33:44.832
Sorry.

33:46.652 --> 33:48.277
It's okay.

33:49.957 --> 33:51.402
You speak English?

33:51.955 --> 33:53.316
A little, yeah.

33:53.449 --> 33:56.664
Wow, that's fanta...,
uh that's great.

34:02.374 --> 34:08.570
So, you have any recommendations
where to go around here?

34:09.917 --> 34:12.929
Uh Madrid is very big, but,

34:14.449 --> 34:16.274
have you seen Plaza Mayor yet?

34:17.183 --> 34:18.523
No I don't think so.

34:20.926 --> 34:23.510
I'm going over in that direction,
I can go with you

34:23.666 --> 34:24.774
if you want.

34:24.827 --> 34:26.782
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

34:26.860 --> 34:29.165
I mean I don't wanna put you out
or anything.

34:29.373 --> 34:30.873
No, it's fine.

34:32.699 --> 34:35.532
That'd be fantastic,
thank's.

34:36.792 --> 34:39.125
It's okay, you're welcome.

34:41.788 --> 34:43.659
So what brings you to Madrid?

34:44.690 --> 34:48.565
Well, it's always been
my dream to come here.

34:49.125 --> 34:52.583
Your dream, Madrid is nobody's dream,

34:52.629 --> 34:57.679
people dream about going to
Paris, Rome, but not Madrid.

34:57.999 --> 35:00.207
What are you talking about,
are you crazy?

35:03.830 --> 35:06.843
Oh, that's Madrid for you.

35:07.488 --> 35:10.171
You see and that's why
Madrid is my favorite place

35:10.208 --> 35:14.375
in the whole world, I mean
from the music, the food,

35:14.583 --> 35:19.833
the beautiful women,
but especially Don Quixote.

35:20.737 --> 35:23.945
Wow, I'm impressed,
you even know Don Quixote.

35:24.000 --> 35:27.234
Oh he has been my
obsession since I was a kid.

35:27.458 --> 35:30.166
I mean from all those
adventures to the romantic

35:30.250 --> 35:32.625
and unconditional love
between Don Quixote

35:32.749 --> 35:34.523
and the beautiful Dulcinea.

35:34.625 --> 35:37.593
How do you know
she was beautiful though?

35:37.875 --> 35:40.916
Didn't they say she was
an average field worker?

35:41.042 --> 35:45.084
Hey hey, beauty is in the eye
of the beholder my dear.

35:45.845 --> 35:49.762
Hold on,
I don't even know your name yet.

35:51.174 --> 35:52.353
My name is Isabella.

35:52.458 --> 35:54.083
Oh fancy, Connor.

35:56.511 --> 35:57.595
What is that?

35:58.208 --> 36:01.958
The international
hey nice to meet you sign?

36:02.254 --> 36:06.338
Not here American boy,
here we give two kisses.

36:14.940 --> 36:18.032
Heard about it,
didn't know it was real.

36:18.208 --> 36:20.791
- Come on!
- Oh pardon, pardon!

36:21.744 --> 36:24.072
So what have you visited so far?

36:24.170 --> 36:25.533
- You know not much.
- Oh.

36:25.580 --> 36:27.408
I've only been here a couple of hours,

36:27.458 --> 36:32.267
and this place is a lot
bigger than I thought, so.

36:32.875 --> 36:36.187
The best part about Madrid
is getting lost at night,

36:36.292 --> 36:41.929
believe me, the way the city
is lit, it gets so beautiful.

36:42.247 --> 36:45.020
God, what are you,
some human stuck

36:45.083 --> 36:47.254
in the Romanticism era?

36:47.875 --> 36:50.645
Says the guy who is in love
with an imaginary character.

36:50.750 --> 36:53.418
Ah all right, touche, touche.

36:54.080 --> 36:56.817
Speaking about your imaginary friends,

36:57.039 --> 36:59.289
have you seen their statues yet?

37:00.208 --> 37:03.637
Uh no, I didn't even
know such a thing existed!

37:03.705 --> 37:04.786
Oh yeah.

37:10.833 --> 37:11.650
Yes?

37:14.197 --> 37:16.408
I don't hear you.
One second.

37:16.924 --> 37:20.330
Ricardo?
Now I hear you well.

37:37.167 --> 37:38.917
Sorry it was Ricardo.

37:40.039 --> 37:43.259
Hmm, you know that might
be the most masculine

37:43.330 --> 37:46.539
Spanish name I've ever heard, Ricardo.

37:47.622 --> 37:49.099
I would probably date him too exactly.

37:49.164 --> 37:52.373
Well he's not my boyfriend.

37:52.497 --> 37:57.537
I met him a couple of days
back, but I'll meet him later.

37:57.622 --> 37:59.326
- Okay, cool.
- Yeah.

37:59.664 --> 38:02.831
So uhm,
where you heading to now?

38:06.458 --> 38:09.708
Knowing that there is a statue
about your imaginary friend,

38:09.917 --> 38:12.326
I thought I'd just
show it to you.

38:12.747 --> 38:13.787
Ah!

38:14.080 --> 38:16.294
Otherwise I'm gonna
feel horrible when you cry

38:16.542 --> 38:18.591
because you never found it.

38:20.419 --> 38:22.955
Who do you think I am senorita.

38:23.917 --> 38:24.751
Come on.

38:27.333 --> 38:29.658
Did you come here all by yourself?

38:30.080 --> 38:36.306
I did yeah, my girlfriend,
well ex-girlfriend now

38:36.872 --> 38:39.825
dumped me a couple
of weeks ago after

38:39.917 --> 38:42.125
being together for nine years.

38:42.333 --> 38:44.864
Oh, I'm sorry.

38:45.520 --> 38:47.200
Ah it's all good.

38:47.914 --> 38:49.831
She was fucking my brother.

38:50.542 --> 38:51.632
Oh man.

38:53.507 --> 38:56.734
Well at least you have
only one brother huh?

38:57.539 --> 39:00.205
I mean it would have
been way more awkward

39:00.257 --> 39:02.835
if she was dating two
of your brothers.

39:13.439 --> 39:16.897
Here they are,
Don Quixote and Sancho Panza.

39:19.689 --> 39:21.282
This is incredible.

39:22.548 --> 39:26.508
You know my mom bought me
a copy when she visited Spain

39:26.708 --> 39:31.125
when I was a kid, but I never
got around to read it,

39:31.406 --> 39:34.231
because of my poor, poor Spanish.

39:38.601 --> 39:41.112
You know
I always wanted to be like him.

39:44.773 --> 39:47.307
Foolish and without a sense of reality?

39:47.375 --> 39:49.503
No no, nah not that.

39:50.581 --> 39:52.206
Just the commitment part.

39:53.875 --> 39:54.833
But?

39:55.023 --> 39:56.689
You know being able
to give up everything

39:56.750 --> 39:58.542
- for a good cause.
- Oh.

39:59.458 --> 40:03.551
But you know he's just
a character right,

40:03.648 --> 40:06.053
he was never actually real.

40:06.936 --> 40:08.882
I know, I know.

40:13.792 --> 40:15.792
I think Sancho is the
must underrated

40:15.917 --> 40:18.875
character of this story, yeah.

40:20.507 --> 40:22.779
That's the true love story from that book,

40:22.881 --> 40:25.590
the love of Sancho for Don Quixote.

40:29.723 --> 40:32.450
You know I never thought
of it like that before.

40:35.042 --> 40:35.875
Wow.

40:38.555 --> 40:40.305
Hey are you hungry?

40:41.542 --> 40:44.417
I could go for some good ham
about not to be honest.

40:45.417 --> 40:47.708
Have you tried spicy potatoes yet?

40:47.917 --> 40:49.292
No what's that?

40:50.708 --> 40:53.972
- You'll thank me later, yeah.
- Oh, after you.

40:55.792 --> 40:58.708
Let's go with the flow

40:59.173 --> 41:03.042
Relax, and watch what happens

41:04.667 --> 41:08.500
Cause we got the time,
the evenin' is fine

41:08.833 --> 41:11.250
And so are you

41:12.833 --> 41:15.073
We just said hello

41:15.229 --> 41:19.972
We can save goodbye for tomorrow

41:20.289 --> 41:24.300
Hmm let's do it

41:25.208 --> 41:28.291
Let's go with the flow

41:29.298 --> 41:31.860
We could take it to show

41:32.298 --> 41:36.465
They got two for one
down at the Ava Lounge

41:37.917 --> 41:41.875
Or, if you prefer,I could be your chauffeur

41:42.125 --> 41:44.787
Just drive around town

41:45.673 --> 41:48.131
I got plenty o' dough

41:48.474 --> 41:50.756
I found 16 bucks in my overcoat...

41:50.841 --> 41:56.020
I gotta tell you, this city is exactly
what I was expecting it to be.

41:56.667 --> 41:58.125
I'm glad.

42:01.167 --> 42:04.751
So, now that we are here,

42:04.958 --> 42:07.243
what's the reason
you came to Madrid?

42:08.583 --> 42:12.157
I told you, my favorite
place in the whole world,

42:12.292 --> 42:14.065
always wanted to come here.

42:14.690 --> 42:17.440
Really,
are you going to lie to me now?

42:17.542 --> 42:19.875
Hey let's go check this out.

42:21.833 --> 42:25.750
All right, so, who is this hunk?

42:26.416 --> 42:29.507
This is Velazquez, a Spanish painter.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.042
Aren't you gonna be late
for your date?

42:39.116 --> 42:41.315
I won't be if you
don't tell me the truth.

42:44.389 --> 42:45.180
Fine.

42:46.940 --> 42:48.798
I tried to kill myself.

42:50.187 --> 42:54.062
Twice, actually, but I guess I'm
not very good at that either.

42:57.219 --> 42:58.804
What was the reason?

43:00.292 --> 43:06.093
Well other than my ex, my uh,
my mother passed away,

43:06.708 --> 43:09.622
and I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.

43:10.722 --> 43:11.786
Why?

43:12.153 --> 43:14.301
Because everyone thought
I was on tour with this band

43:14.375 --> 43:17.250
that doesn't exist,
when in reality I was

43:17.637 --> 43:20.512
cleaning toilets in a very shitty bar.

43:22.559 --> 43:26.162
Yep, that's me, that's who I am.

43:29.349 --> 43:31.459
What instrument do you play?

43:32.099 --> 43:33.057
Really,

43:33.490 --> 43:36.279
after everything I just said
that's your follow-up question?

43:36.537 --> 43:40.944
Yeah, we could cry here
all night if you want,

43:41.507 --> 43:44.465
which I'm sure you've already
had your fair share of.

43:45.375 --> 43:50.288
Or we can just keep getting
to know each other?

43:53.129 --> 43:56.441
You know,
in a very cold-hearted way

43:56.730 --> 43:58.798
that actually makes a little sense.

44:00.090 --> 44:03.043
And I play guitar, for your information.

44:03.215 --> 44:07.173
- Oh really, since when?
- Since I was nine.

44:07.257 --> 44:09.766
My mom bought me my very first one.

44:10.757 --> 44:12.376
- Do you sing?
- I do.

44:14.196 --> 44:15.915
Sing for me then.

44:16.430 --> 44:19.305
Right here, in the cold, nah.

44:19.445 --> 44:21.664
Come on, don't be a pussy.

44:21.792 --> 44:26.867
Wow, okay, I uh, I'll sing for you,

44:27.590 --> 44:29.673
if you draw me something.

44:32.875 --> 44:34.000
Fair enough.

44:36.365 --> 44:38.697
Okay, three,

44:39.377 --> 44:40.314
two,

44:40.625 --> 44:42.542
one, go!

44:42.590 --> 44:48.006
Happy Birthday, happy Birthday.

44:48.083 --> 44:51.929
Really, come on,
that's not even fair!

44:54.625 --> 44:57.703
- My God, don't move that much.
- All right.

45:00.733 --> 45:02.399
I said don't move.

45:04.432 --> 45:06.099
- Good.
- Don't move.

45:06.917 --> 45:09.472
- Really, please.
- All right.

45:12.956 --> 45:14.456
Okay, it's done.

45:16.680 --> 45:18.050
Let's see what you got.

45:22.092 --> 45:26.342
Hey look at that,
that's actually really good.

45:29.851 --> 45:32.265
But if I can make one change though.

45:32.617 --> 45:33.673
Oh what?

45:35.295 --> 45:39.484
The nose, I feel like
it's a little too big,

45:39.640 --> 45:41.569
especially like in the
bottom area right here...

45:41.673 --> 45:45.840
I'm thinking let's go with the flow

45:48.542 --> 45:51.292
Let's go slow

45:53.458 --> 45:56.000
So, what about your nose?

45:58.465 --> 46:01.057
Yeah, it's perfectly fine the way it is.

46:07.875 --> 46:08.958
For me?

46:09.310 --> 46:11.106
Yeah, I mean,

46:12.044 --> 46:16.223
I don't want some huge,
creepy big nose in my notebook.

46:16.292 --> 46:18.887
All right say no more, say no more.

46:20.810 --> 46:24.605
So why don't you
meet me here tomorrow,

46:24.785 --> 46:27.402
after breakfast, we can go for a walk,

46:27.500 --> 46:30.500
and I show you some other cool places.

46:31.227 --> 46:32.906
That sounds amazing.

46:33.981 --> 46:35.898
- 11 o'clock.
- Perfect.

46:40.750 --> 46:41.750
- Bye.
- Bye.

46:45.727 --> 46:48.551
Should I be worried you only gave me one?

46:49.508 --> 46:51.508
That means I like you.

47:01.042 --> 47:06.000
Here comes that tune that's so familiar

47:08.727 --> 47:12.894
Because it sounds to me,
that the time has come

47:16.000 --> 47:19.676
There's no need to faint,
but I waited so long

47:19.769 --> 47:22.486
But I waited so long

47:23.958 --> 47:27.408
And if you feel the same way I do

47:27.625 --> 47:29.750
Maybe I do

47:31.417 --> 47:35.534
Just take my hand,
it's time for two

47:42.208 --> 47:46.760
Sun starts going to shine,
birds are going to sing

47:49.685 --> 47:52.769
I could give my life,
you could get my life

47:52.833 --> 47:55.972
I've been the girl with the leaf

47:57.583 --> 48:02.375
But if you never see me there

48:05.208 --> 48:08.916
Don't let me think
that it's time for two

48:38.792 --> 48:43.001
Afraid of never seeing you there

48:46.375 --> 48:50.375
I wanna say it's time for two

48:52.000 --> 48:55.299
It's time for two,

48:55.811 --> 48:59.002
it's time for two

49:05.644 --> 49:06.560
Isabella.

49:08.083 --> 49:10.962
You didn't show up this morning,
everything okay?

49:14.458 --> 49:18.333
Hmm, sorry but I think you're
confusing me with somebody else.

49:20.184 --> 49:23.129
What are you talking about,
it's, hold up,

49:23.185 --> 49:25.606
hold, wait it's me,
don't you remember,

49:25.708 --> 49:27.708
- we spent the entire day...
- Sorry, I don't.

49:27.833 --> 49:30.208
No, no, you it's me,
we spent the entire day

49:30.292 --> 49:32.959
together yesterday, we kissed,
you drew me a painting.

49:33.102 --> 49:34.352
Here, it's here...

49:34.932 --> 49:37.227
- Shit I think I forgot it.
- Sorry but I have to leave.

49:37.333 --> 49:40.158
- Hey what is wrong?
- Hey don't touch me!

50:00.435 --> 50:01.269
What?

50:04.042 --> 50:05.817
What the fuck is going on?

50:07.372 --> 50:09.380
Martha, I need to speak to you.

50:09.513 --> 50:12.762
Connor what are you doing here,
this is not my office hours.

50:12.838 --> 50:14.672
Your ring, it's broken.

50:14.708 --> 50:15.997
What do you mean it's broken?

50:16.083 --> 50:18.083
It's not working right, so,

50:18.208 --> 50:21.291
I went to Madrid yesterday right,
spent the entire day there,

50:21.458 --> 50:24.276
go back there again today,
it's the exact same,

50:24.322 --> 50:25.846
like everbody had left.

50:26.421 --> 50:28.046
How did you know?

50:30.166 --> 50:31.331
I met this girl, okay...

50:31.417 --> 50:36.250
Ah, oh my god, Connor!

50:36.417 --> 50:40.958
What have I told you,
do not go back to the place twice!

50:41.083 --> 50:43.963
You broke the only rule
that is for this ring.

50:45.125 --> 50:50.447
Hold on a second, are you telling me
there's nothing I can do about this?

50:50.500 --> 50:52.042
I really like this girl Martha!

50:52.072 --> 50:54.771
Connor the reason
why I gave you this ring

50:54.857 --> 50:57.826
was so you can escape
life for a little bit,

50:57.990 --> 50:59.779
not to create yourself a new one,

50:59.874 --> 51:02.041
it doesn't work like that.

51:03.637 --> 51:04.607
Fuck!

51:06.374 --> 51:08.708
I had that ring hidden for so long,

51:08.750 --> 51:12.125
you know why, because if
you don't use it wisely,

51:12.249 --> 51:14.210
you might end up in this kind of cycle,

51:14.274 --> 51:17.038
and seriously, it's
gonna take you nowhere.

51:17.874 --> 51:19.377
You have to understand.

51:19.458 --> 51:21.697
Is everything okay Ms. West?

51:22.041 --> 51:25.458
Sorry dear this is a friendly argument.

51:26.458 --> 51:29.750
Okay, get back to bed I'm really sorry.

51:30.876 --> 51:32.345
What is she doing here?

51:33.178 --> 51:35.303
Did you forget already when
you spent a couple of weeks

51:35.375 --> 51:37.333
in my house, or what?

51:50.215 --> 51:51.926
Do you wanna give it back to me?

51:54.042 --> 51:58.838
No, it's fine,
I'll figure it out, thanks.

52:07.250 --> 52:09.080
What the fuck do you want?

52:16.093 --> 52:16.927
What?

52:21.917 --> 52:23.417
You sure that's okay Dad?

52:24.441 --> 52:27.793
I have cancer,
not intolerance to alcohol idiot.

52:44.885 --> 52:48.922
Look I appreciate your worrying
but, you're good to go.

52:49.358 --> 52:51.234
Come on Dad, for real?

52:52.187 --> 52:54.403
Maybe I shouldn't have called you
just yet Connor.

52:54.583 --> 52:57.028
- Look, give it some time...
- You shut the fuck up.

52:57.825 --> 53:01.458
Look Dad, I'm real sorry
for what happened okay,

53:01.667 --> 53:04.036
you can't hold this shit in forever.

53:06.417 --> 53:10.499
I'm not angry because you weren't
here when your mother died.

53:13.458 --> 53:14.514
I...

53:20.292 --> 53:21.583
I almost didn't care,

53:22.270 --> 53:25.062
because I thought you were doing
what you wanted,

53:25.523 --> 53:29.461
but you weren't,
I drove to that bar,

53:30.292 --> 53:32.772
the one you said
that you were playing at,

53:34.833 --> 53:38.593
I was hoping you were keeping
the promise you made to her.

53:40.333 --> 53:43.583
But then, what do I find?

53:44.833 --> 53:48.043
I find my son, my own son?

53:49.760 --> 53:53.113
Cleaning the shit
from everbody's assholes.

53:55.249 --> 53:58.333
- Dad, it's just...
- All of those guitar lessons?

53:59.121 --> 54:01.413
For what, for nothing!

54:04.218 --> 54:06.218
You never played for us.

54:07.167 --> 54:08.223
Not once.

54:09.905 --> 54:11.364
All that support.

54:13.645 --> 54:17.958
Don't come here looking for
the love you don't deserve.

54:22.208 --> 54:24.208
Why didn't you reply sooner?

54:25.999 --> 54:30.208
- I've been busy.
- He's been busy.

54:31.041 --> 54:32.874
Connor wait, Connor!

54:40.814 --> 54:43.215
You know I'm really
worried about you Connor.

54:46.458 --> 54:47.458
No need.

54:49.392 --> 54:50.392
I'm leaving.

54:51.835 --> 54:53.942
You know you can't run away forever.

54:54.000 --> 54:55.583
Fucking watch me.

55:14.667 --> 55:18.079
Hi, is it there yet?

55:19.306 --> 55:22.348
Ok, I'm going there.

55:22.993 --> 55:25.243
Ok. Now I see you.

55:34.417 --> 55:40.744
Paris oh, I wanted
to see in you Paris oh

55:41.611 --> 55:45.583
The place that we used to call paradise

55:46.197 --> 55:50.249
Starry night under the rain

55:53.624 --> 55:59.595
Paris, I waited to see you in Paris, oh

56:00.583 --> 56:05.359
The day that we actually never met

56:05.499 --> 56:09.374
Starry night along the ramp

56:42.999 --> 56:44.724
Oh no photo.

56:49.350 --> 56:52.678
I don't know what you're saying but if
you could stop it'd be great, thank you.

56:58.708 --> 56:59.592
With you?

57:01.583 --> 57:02.353
Okay.

57:08.042 --> 57:09.208
Oh Isabella!

57:19.436 --> 57:21.061
Oh I'm good thanks.

57:22.474 --> 57:23.307
Okay.

57:47.250 --> 57:50.251
The girl, Isabella.

57:54.125 --> 57:58.042
Oh my God, I am so sorry.

57:58.513 --> 57:59.548
It's okay.

58:06.708 --> 58:10.330
Is it uhm, uhm girlfriend?

58:11.095 --> 58:12.291
No, uh no.

58:13.125 --> 58:16.955
Just this girl that I met.

58:18.116 --> 58:20.264
You understand what I'm saying.

58:22.319 --> 58:23.288
Where?

58:23.713 --> 58:24.702
Madrid.

58:31.202 --> 58:34.212
And uhm, why are you not with her?

58:36.614 --> 58:39.501
It's not that simple, sadly.

58:41.192 --> 58:43.782
I can't really be with her.

58:48.083 --> 58:49.712
It's tough to explain.

58:52.739 --> 58:56.905
Even I wanted to, I could
only be with her for one day.

59:00.533 --> 59:02.948
I don't even know why
I'm telling you this.

59:06.038 --> 59:07.955
I know boys like you.

59:10.694 --> 59:11.528
Trouble.

59:15.268 --> 59:16.292
Unhappy.

59:19.522 --> 59:24.772
I think, that,
if she makes you feel happy,

59:25.146 --> 59:30.448
even just one day, I think
you should go and see her.

59:41.400 --> 59:43.859
You make me feel happy one day.

59:58.375 --> 01:00:01.417
- What do you do?
- You paint a lot pretty.

01:00:03.953 --> 01:00:06.156
I like what you paint,

01:00:06.391 --> 01:00:08.057
Much pretty, much.

01:00:11.546 --> 01:00:13.343
- Very.
- What?

01:00:13.773 --> 01:00:16.913
- Very pretty, not much pretty.
- Ah yeah yeah I got you.

01:00:18.265 --> 01:00:19.304
Sorry.

01:00:22.663 --> 01:00:23.663
It's okay.

01:00:25.272 --> 01:00:27.327
Hey, you speak English?

01:00:55.533 --> 01:00:57.571
My good squire Sancho

01:00:57.712 --> 01:01:00.829
will relate to thee in full.

01:01:01.770 --> 01:01:03.274
Fair ingrate,

01:01:03.509 --> 01:01:05.360
dear enemy,

01:01:05.814 --> 01:01:09.280
the condition to which
I am reduced on thy account:

01:01:09.855 --> 01:01:12.511
if it be thy pleasure
to give me relief,

01:01:12.605 --> 01:01:13.855
I am thine;

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:15.207
if not,

01:01:15.363 --> 01:01:18.613
do as may be pleasing to thee;

01:01:19.059 --> 01:01:24.725
for by ending my life
I shall satisfy thy cruelty

01:01:24.988 --> 01:01:27.238
and my desire.

01:01:28.098 --> 01:01:29.894
Thine till death.

01:01:30.137 --> 01:01:33.261
The Knight of the Rueful Countenance.

01:02:06.458 --> 01:02:07.500
Can I help you?

01:02:07.585 --> 01:02:11.044
Alonso, Alonso, my name is Alonso.

01:02:11.167 --> 01:02:11.916
Great.

01:02:12.599 --> 01:02:14.182
You like Don Quixote?

01:02:14.291 --> 01:02:17.041
I do, it's why I'm reading the book.

01:02:17.486 --> 01:02:19.917
You help me find Dulcinea?

01:02:20.413 --> 01:02:21.413
I'm sorry?

01:02:21.542 --> 01:02:23.590
Dul-ci-ne-a!

01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:26.083
I heard you.

01:02:26.363 --> 01:02:27.972
I just don't know what you mean guy.

01:02:28.082 --> 01:02:31.488
Me Alonso, I look for Dulcinea!

01:02:31.668 --> 01:02:34.668
Alonso huh, as in Don Quixote?

01:02:34.761 --> 01:02:38.570
Yes, yes, the one only,
the one that fought the giant

01:02:38.667 --> 01:02:42.625
and defeated numerous VIPs,
and dishonor people.

01:02:43.429 --> 01:02:45.179
And finally we agree!

01:02:46.093 --> 01:02:47.551
I gotta get going.

01:02:49.708 --> 01:02:53.180
Wait, I need Sancho, you Sancho?

01:02:53.288 --> 01:02:55.747
Wait, wait, wait!

01:02:56.530 --> 01:03:00.149
Wait, I need Sancho, you Sancho.

01:03:00.391 --> 01:03:02.065
Oh I'm Sancho now, thanks.

01:03:02.159 --> 01:03:07.104
I mean you read the poem I write,
like Sancho in the book.

01:03:07.208 --> 01:03:10.495
Listen pal I'm not in the mood for
funny games all right, take a hike.

01:03:10.573 --> 01:03:14.729
What tales you have to do today,
I will help you,

01:03:14.792 --> 01:03:16.889
find you, a good lady!

01:03:17.538 --> 01:03:19.413
I know you are looking.

01:03:21.413 --> 01:03:22.608
Adventure!

01:03:23.576 --> 01:03:27.242
You know?
As Don Quixote and Sancho Panza.

01:03:30.913 --> 01:03:33.955
- Do you even know who we're looking for?
- Hey!

01:03:38.083 --> 01:03:41.417
The most beautiful woman
in this whole kingdom!

01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:44.758
Right, do you have like a
picture or something like that.

01:03:44.833 --> 01:03:48.039
No, but I will know when I see her.

01:03:48.291 --> 01:03:49.500
Oh God.

01:03:49.765 --> 01:03:52.797
My friend, think with your brain.

01:03:52.875 --> 01:03:56.899
We are now mates, this is
what you always wanted.

01:03:57.458 --> 01:03:58.243
What.

01:03:58.376 --> 01:04:00.583
Come on Sancho, come on!

01:04:02.041 --> 01:04:04.719
She was like my Dulcinea, you know.

01:04:05.141 --> 01:04:07.641
Beautiful, charming, witty.

01:04:08.042 --> 01:04:09.012
What happened?

01:04:10.485 --> 01:04:13.419
Well, it's complicated you know.

01:04:15.041 --> 01:04:17.442
Let's just say that we
don't live in the same time.

01:04:18.724 --> 01:04:20.595
- I know about that.
- Yeah.

01:04:24.125 --> 01:04:26.049
Do you mind if ask
something a little strange?

01:04:26.167 --> 01:04:27.041
Yeah?

01:04:28.333 --> 01:04:29.931
Would you mind reciting the first page

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.720
of the Spanish version of Don Quixote?

01:04:34.125 --> 01:04:36.083
In a village of La Mancha

01:04:36.144 --> 01:04:38.811
the name of which
I have no desire to call to mind

01:04:38.883 --> 01:04:40.656
there lived one of those gentlemen

01:04:40.750 --> 01:04:44.417
that keep a lance in the
lance-rack, an old buckler...

01:04:45.055 --> 01:04:47.312
So you've been looking
for her for 400 years.

01:04:47.542 --> 01:04:51.125
401 my friend, and I'm still looking.

01:04:51.846 --> 01:04:53.174
Shouldn't you move on?

01:04:53.681 --> 01:04:58.228
Never, Dulcinea is all I live for.

01:04:58.958 --> 01:05:02.291
Without her,
I don't know what to do!

01:05:05.042 --> 01:05:07.923
But how can you love someone
you've never even seen.

01:05:09.513 --> 01:05:14.383
Well I just do,
you young people, think you love

01:05:14.458 --> 01:05:17.666
but you don't,
you focus on look.

01:05:18.511 --> 01:05:21.667
Or are afraid of being alone,
but you don't love,

01:05:21.839 --> 01:05:25.011
I don't plan to stop looking for her.

01:05:25.109 --> 01:05:28.192
Because I love her, and she loves me.

01:05:32.147 --> 01:05:32.990
Jesus.

01:05:33.647 --> 01:05:34.803
We done something Sancho.

01:05:34.897 --> 01:05:37.936
- Wait no, wait no, come back!
- Is there a problem, madame?

01:05:38.788 --> 01:05:41.579
No.
Chilvary seems to be dead.

01:05:41.749 --> 01:05:43.311
I beg to differ...

01:05:43.647 --> 01:05:46.693
Some of us believe
in the old fashion ways of living.

01:05:47.225 --> 01:05:48.561
My name is Alonso.

01:05:49.678 --> 01:05:51.262
Paula, my pleasure.

01:05:52.655 --> 01:05:53.722
And your friend?

01:05:53.814 --> 01:05:54.937
This is Sancho.

01:05:56.917 --> 01:06:00.042
- Hi, Connor.
- Hi.

01:06:00.250 --> 01:06:02.625
Is there any way
we could be of assistance?

01:06:10.541 --> 01:06:13.830
I give a party near here.
You still want to come.

01:06:14.231 --> 01:06:16.064
She give party in...

01:06:17.708 --> 01:06:19.292
I'm throwing a party.

01:06:19.533 --> 01:06:21.950
I would like for you
two gentlemen to come.

01:06:22.606 --> 01:06:25.106
I think you could use a drink.

01:06:30.576 --> 01:06:32.660
Sure, why not.

01:06:32.835 --> 01:06:36.589
Wow very good English,
come on Sancho.

01:07:04.375 --> 01:07:05.375
Hello.

01:07:06.719 --> 01:07:08.406
What are you guys up to?

01:07:17.730 --> 01:07:19.807
I know what they're gonna be doing.

01:07:30.105 --> 01:07:30.938
Oh wow.

01:07:35.875 --> 01:07:36.957
Alonso!

01:07:40.917 --> 01:07:41.792
Alonso!

01:07:45.683 --> 01:07:47.654
- Alonso!
- What?

01:07:54.167 --> 01:07:56.792
One time, I fought some thieves

01:07:56.866 --> 01:07:59.454
and they magically turned into wine!

01:07:59.526 --> 01:08:04.750
- That was another time.
- I was defending my honor...

01:08:04.917 --> 01:08:09.133
Another time I fought giants
and nearly defeat...

01:08:09.292 --> 01:08:11.667
Alonso shut up shut up!

01:08:13.083 --> 01:08:13.958
Look!

01:08:15.917 --> 01:08:17.875
There is your Dulcinea.

01:08:20.990 --> 01:08:23.406
Dear Lord, how beautiful.

01:08:25.091 --> 01:08:26.434
Now's your chance, go.

01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:28.707
No, no, no no sir.

01:08:28.772 --> 01:08:32.099
Oh no you are not
gonna pussy out now, go!

01:08:46.792 --> 01:08:48.250
We get it.

01:08:57.688 --> 01:09:00.729
Wow, is this all yours?

01:09:01.091 --> 01:09:01.983
Indeed.

01:09:04.826 --> 01:09:07.279
- You live alone?
- Yep.

01:09:07.667 --> 01:09:09.834
Love was never good to me.

01:09:10.796 --> 01:09:11.928
How so?

01:09:12.917 --> 01:09:14.631
I never like men.

01:09:15.158 --> 01:09:17.242
I tried, but I never did.

01:09:18.167 --> 01:09:21.162
And the one person I loved,
I never met.

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:24.975
So I fulfilled my life throwing parties
to all these fools,

01:09:25.332 --> 01:09:27.292
hoping to find what I miss.

01:09:31.189 --> 01:09:36.323
Wow, that's so deep,
and sad at the same time.

01:09:39.292 --> 01:09:41.260
I know you're feeling though.

01:09:41.319 --> 01:09:44.979
Don't get me wrong, I don't want
to listen to your story.

01:09:45.703 --> 01:09:48.841
My advices were never very good,
and you will end up

01:09:48.897 --> 01:09:50.904
more depressed than you already are.

01:09:57.201 --> 01:09:58.991
How is your friend doing?

01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:02.083
Pretty good actually.

01:10:03.583 --> 01:10:08.300
I think he may have found his
woman, the redhead out there.

01:10:08.897 --> 01:10:10.688
The mighty Dulcinea.

01:10:16.010 --> 01:10:19.224
Seriously, that's her name?

01:10:19.688 --> 01:10:20.522
Yes.

01:10:24.646 --> 01:10:26.519
You seem very foolish.

01:10:34.855 --> 01:10:38.058
I don't know what to believe anymore
to be honest with you.

01:10:40.549 --> 01:10:42.618
I don't know how to be on my own,

01:10:43.027 --> 01:10:44.094
I don't know,

01:10:46.821 --> 01:10:49.462
I don't know how to not love.

01:10:51.651 --> 01:10:55.026
You don't have to learn,
you just gotta live with it.

01:10:56.076 --> 01:10:58.017
Pretend it doesn't hurt you,

01:10:58.072 --> 01:11:00.611
when everybody else
is happier than you are.

01:11:10.958 --> 01:11:15.208
Hey, all right, spill it,
tell me everything, how'd it go?

01:11:16.644 --> 01:11:20.940
Sancho my friend,
she was already a loved woman.

01:11:22.250 --> 01:11:23.834
What do you mean?

01:11:26.208 --> 01:11:30.625
You were right, maybe it's just time
to let go you know?

01:11:32.750 --> 01:11:35.654
No no that doesn't make sense.

01:11:37.253 --> 01:11:39.560
That is Dulcinea out there right?

01:11:39.745 --> 01:11:43.920
Now you talk sense,
I though you didn't believe me.

01:11:44.117 --> 01:11:47.242
But you read the book,
she is not real.

01:11:47.375 --> 01:11:48.973
Only in my head.

01:11:49.042 --> 01:11:51.209
No no no no no, no!

01:11:51.856 --> 01:11:56.231
You are Alonso, Don fucking Quixote.

01:11:56.489 --> 01:11:58.980
You deserve your Dulcinea.

01:12:00.262 --> 01:12:04.926
There were never giants,
there were just windmills.

01:12:07.833 --> 01:12:09.625
Great to meet you Sancho.

01:12:38.584 --> 01:12:41.354
Come on honey
let's get you home.

01:12:41.958 --> 01:12:44.885
I don't know,
I don't even know.

01:12:46.042 --> 01:12:50.354
I have to find a way to be with her
for more than one day.

01:13:18.471 --> 01:13:19.797
Martha wake up!

01:13:22.667 --> 01:13:23.583
Fuck this!

01:13:23.688 --> 01:13:27.429
- You look extremely drunk.
- Martha, I need to see her!

01:13:27.542 --> 01:13:28.664
Connor!

01:13:58.060 --> 01:13:59.976
Oh fuck.

01:14:12.156 --> 01:14:13.388
Where's the ring?

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:18.131
Nah-ah, I have given you
too much pain, that's enough.

01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:22.780
No it's fine I promise,
I just had a rough night.

01:14:31.917 --> 01:14:33.498
I know how it feels.

01:14:37.208 --> 01:14:40.208
I also met someone
when I used to travel.

01:14:44.292 --> 01:14:48.001
But having to go every
single day and meet them

01:14:48.068 --> 01:14:49.609
for the first time.

01:14:52.808 --> 01:14:56.125
It's rough, it's too much.

01:14:59.857 --> 01:15:02.133
But why then does such
a thing exist?

01:15:06.636 --> 01:15:09.178
People who really wanna
be done with this life

01:15:09.233 --> 01:15:11.381
would know how to use it properly.

01:15:13.342 --> 01:15:14.383
Us,

01:15:16.705 --> 01:15:20.865
we're just constantly looking
for somebody to love us.

01:15:23.542 --> 01:15:25.792
Did you ever find anybody after?

01:15:35.485 --> 01:15:39.188
You look like a mess
you should go home and have a shower.

01:16:01.818 --> 01:16:02.651
Hey.

01:16:06.115 --> 01:16:10.413
Uh, hey I'm sorry about
hitting you the other day.

01:16:12.917 --> 01:16:16.229
Hmm, it's all good,
I deserved it.

01:16:18.671 --> 01:16:19.815
Welcome back.

01:16:20.386 --> 01:16:21.219
Thanks.

01:16:25.476 --> 01:16:30.135
Uhm, you know I actually
heard you play your guitar,

01:16:30.331 --> 01:16:34.097
you sound really good,
are you a musician or?

01:16:36.417 --> 01:16:39.783
Nah, uh, maybe one day.

01:16:43.836 --> 01:16:45.330
So where did you move from.

01:16:45.583 --> 01:16:48.220
- New York.
- How do you like it?

01:16:48.844 --> 01:16:49.678
Here?

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.172
Yeah I know that,
L.A. can be kinda tough.

01:16:55.326 --> 01:17:00.203
Yeah, the loneliness
that's the toughest part.

01:17:07.318 --> 01:17:08.456
Hey by the way.

01:17:12.365 --> 01:17:15.906
What you're doing to yourself, don't.

01:17:17.167 --> 01:17:18.500
It doesn't actually work.

01:17:19.511 --> 01:17:23.386
Well maybe
you should play more often,

01:17:23.511 --> 01:17:25.344
because it's relaxing.

01:17:39.875 --> 01:17:45.210
Coming up, this tower brings you down

01:17:46.218 --> 01:17:50.608
This tower, even when the lights go out

01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:54.046
There's no more rights

01:17:54.167 --> 01:17:57.084
Let's go, let's go

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:02.451
Staring at your shadow on the ground

01:18:02.542 --> 01:18:05.888
Staring at your shadow

01:18:06.042 --> 01:18:12.633
After the world
you will still be around

01:18:16.908 --> 01:18:17.824
Hey Fred.

01:18:20.917 --> 01:18:23.249
Fred where you at?

01:18:26.309 --> 01:18:28.309
I got something for you.

01:18:39.327 --> 01:18:42.420
I'm gonna go downstairs
and grab Mom's guitar.

01:18:42.750 --> 01:18:43.795
Connor?

01:18:44.875 --> 01:18:45.839
Connor.

01:18:46.347 --> 01:18:47.249
Henry?

01:18:49.933 --> 01:18:51.100
Where's Dad?

01:18:52.917 --> 01:18:54.750
I've been trying to call you
for days Connor.

01:18:55.167 --> 01:18:59.315
Yeah I kinda lost my phone,
where's Dad?

01:19:22.082 --> 01:19:23.082
No...

01:20:03.635 --> 01:20:05.204
You had Mom in your corner.

01:20:07.703 --> 01:20:09.408
Remember when we were kids?

01:20:10.921 --> 01:20:14.408
It was just like goof
around before school and,

01:20:14.579 --> 01:20:18.538
and then one day you just
started jumping on the bed

01:20:19.375 --> 01:20:22.046
and you broke the slides, you know,

01:20:22.961 --> 01:20:25.280
and I ended up getting my ass whipped.

01:20:38.135 --> 01:20:40.006
Dad left something for you.

01:21:12.618 --> 01:21:13.719
It's Moms.

01:21:21.215 --> 01:21:22.801
Dad wanted you to have it.

01:21:32.250 --> 01:21:34.583
- What's this?
- What's what?

01:21:58.792 --> 01:22:01.064
- What is it?
- Nothing, nothing.

01:22:09.458 --> 01:22:14.217
Martha came by, uhm,
you two had a fight.

01:22:14.734 --> 01:22:18.248
Yeah, yeah I'm a fucking prick.

01:22:18.993 --> 01:22:20.201
Yeah.

01:22:23.917 --> 01:22:26.335
Uh she wanted me to give you this.

01:22:32.098 --> 01:22:33.898
I don't know what's in it.

01:22:45.252 --> 01:22:46.869
Are you gonna be okay?

01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:49.485
Yeah.

01:22:51.535 --> 01:22:52.368
Yeah.

01:23:30.958 --> 01:23:31.792
Shit.

01:24:01.458 --> 01:24:02.856
Oh shit.

01:24:29.809 --> 01:24:32.394
- Can I help you?
- Yes, yes you can.

01:24:33.707 --> 01:24:35.499
I have something for you.

01:24:38.965 --> 01:24:39.965
Who is he?

01:24:40.397 --> 01:24:42.530
He says he has something for me.

01:24:46.452 --> 01:24:47.586
What do you want?

01:24:49.585 --> 01:24:51.718
- Relax...
- Excuse me, my bad.

01:24:54.452 --> 01:24:56.366
Have a nice day.

01:25:03.335 --> 01:25:04.802
Who the fuck was that?

01:25:04.851 --> 01:25:07.608
Not sure,
but he had my notebook.

01:25:23.729 --> 01:25:25.518
Why do you have this?

01:25:25.698 --> 01:25:26.846
Sorry?

01:25:27.644 --> 01:25:29.495
Why do you have this?

01:25:31.060 --> 01:25:34.768
Okay look, I will explain everything.

01:25:36.052 --> 01:25:39.661
Just please, just, just
give me 10 minutes okay?

01:25:45.036 --> 01:25:47.395
This is not possible, this...

01:25:47.561 --> 01:25:51.073
Yeah I know,
it's crazy to me too.

01:25:52.089 --> 01:25:54.964
- Do you still have the ring.
- Nah.

01:25:55.203 --> 01:25:57.536
No, I don't need it anymore.

01:25:59.703 --> 01:26:02.406
How many days you say
we spent together?

01:26:04.036 --> 01:26:04.953
28.

01:26:06.773 --> 01:26:10.179
One for each drawing.

01:26:11.414 --> 01:26:12.828
This is crazy.

01:26:14.208 --> 01:26:15.041
Okay.

01:26:18.328 --> 01:26:19.326
Perfect.

01:26:25.203 --> 01:26:26.536
- This is us.
- Yeah.

01:26:26.703 --> 01:26:29.289
Right here at this exact same spot,

01:26:29.371 --> 01:26:33.007
you taught me all about
the Spanish history,

01:26:33.129 --> 01:26:36.921
and you made fun of me for my
obsession with Don Quixote.

01:26:45.542 --> 01:26:47.208
Hey I'm sorry, I...

01:26:48.659 --> 01:26:50.901
This must sound insane,
I'm so sorry.

01:26:52.911 --> 01:26:55.661
You came all the way here, why?

01:26:59.028 --> 01:27:00.070
Well,

01:27:01.471 --> 01:27:05.614
in my reality, Ricardo was
just a missed phone call from you,

01:27:06.926 --> 01:27:08.903
you were supposed
to meet up with him that day

01:27:08.995 --> 01:27:12.911
when you met me,
and instead of going to him...

01:27:16.250 --> 01:27:17.675
You stayed with me.

01:27:19.929 --> 01:27:23.846
And that day just kept
repeating and repeating.

01:27:27.370 --> 01:27:28.670
And that was?

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.917
Two months ago, I know.

01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:41.536
Now what do you want me to do?

01:27:43.645 --> 01:27:44.479
Nothing.

01:27:46.917 --> 01:27:47.996
Except...

01:27:54.775 --> 01:27:57.359
Maybe have a walk with me?

01:28:04.833 --> 01:28:05.745
Sure.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.182
But one of our places that we came to,

01:28:13.245 --> 01:28:15.323
this was probably my absolute favorite.

01:28:15.457 --> 01:28:16.582
Oh yeah why?

01:28:16.661 --> 01:28:22.591
Well this spot right here, is the
very first time that we kissed.

01:28:23.382 --> 01:28:25.598
- Oh really, here?
- Yeah, yep.

01:28:28.042 --> 01:28:30.417
- Sorry.
- No I'm sorry.

01:28:31.250 --> 01:28:34.708
You should go, I've taken
up enough of your time.

01:28:36.343 --> 01:28:41.218
Well thank you
for the most bizarre experience of

01:28:41.292 --> 01:28:46.831
my entire life, I really
liked hearing all our stories.

01:28:50.417 --> 01:28:53.167
I hope you have a wonderful life Isabella,

01:28:53.583 --> 01:28:57.125
and it was an absolute
pleasure to meet you.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:08.536
Likewise, Mr. Sancho.

01:29:09.871 --> 01:29:11.413
Will you be leaving now?

01:29:11.523 --> 01:29:16.067
Uhm, soon, there is still
one more thing I gotta do.

01:29:22.744 --> 01:29:24.077
Are you ready?

01:29:26.009 --> 01:29:27.509
For Dulcinea?

01:29:27.611 --> 01:29:29.455
For Dulcinea!

01:31:34.033 --> 01:31:36.199
Wow, nice view.

01:31:38.292 --> 01:31:39.751
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:31:41.667 --> 01:31:45.205
It's good to see you,
what are you doing up here?

01:31:46.382 --> 01:31:52.236
Well, I, I actually was going
to ask you out on a date.

01:31:52.970 --> 01:31:57.887
Yeah, but, you weren't at
your place, so here I am.

01:32:00.700 --> 01:32:02.946
How'd you know I'd be here?

01:32:03.417 --> 01:32:07.759
Uh Martha, she knows all of our secrets.

01:32:13.542 --> 01:32:18.498
But, you weren't going to, you know?

01:32:19.930 --> 01:32:24.014
- No no no, no no, no, no.
- Okay, okay good good.

01:32:28.306 --> 01:32:30.806
I wanted to have one last visit.

01:32:31.028 --> 01:32:32.695
Good, that's good.

01:32:44.921 --> 01:32:47.504
So how's this for a first date.

01:32:48.585 --> 01:32:49.418
This?

01:32:52.125 --> 01:32:53.417
This is just fine.

01:33:00.157 --> 01:33:01.907
So what's your story?

01:33:03.458 --> 01:33:08.423
my story, wow,
that's a very big question.

01:33:09.384 --> 01:33:12.837
Let's see, well I guess it
all started with this girl.

01:33:12.917 --> 01:33:15.032
This was the story of Sancho,

01:33:15.133 --> 01:33:19.868
an unknown hero, and after all,
my dearest friend.

01:33:22.125 --> 01:33:23.201
OK.
