another fancy science word?

09:21.461 --> 09:24.379
We get it, science.
You use big words.

09:25.966 --> 09:28.583
No. It's when someone from
the job you're applying for

a congratulations sundae?

I will, when you do something
worth congratulating.

09:49.289 --> 09:50.956
That's okay, ms. Reynolds.

09:51.107 --> 09:53.708
I should really go home and
tell my family the good news.

No way.
If they find out,

Oh, I got the job.

19:29.869 --> 19:32.570
Darwin said I must be
a great employee

19:32.688 --> 19:34.655
if someone is willing to lie
to keep me.

19:34.707 --> 19:36.707
Wait, how'd he know
I was lying?

19:36.826 --> 19:38.826
Because you wore this.

19:38.878 --> 19:41.379
Every time you lied,
the bracelet changed color.

Stupid science!

19:45.969 --> 19:47.835
Max, why don't you keep it?

19:47.887 --> 19:50.087
It'll remind you to never
lie to me again.

Trust me,
I've learned my lesson.

You know, just because
we're not working together

doesn't mean we can't
hang out anymore.

Sorry for what?

20:23.289 --> 20:25.172
For leaving yesterday.

20:25.258 --> 20:27.174
I was kind of embarrassed
you found out

20:27.260 --> 20:29.510
I hadn't made
any other friends here.

20:29.596 --> 20:31.178
Don't be embarrassed.

20:31.264 --> 20:33.014
I shouldn't have pushed you.

Making new friends is tough.
Just ask kindergarten me.

Hard to believe anyone wouldn't
want to be friends with you.

20:42.392 --> 20:45.893
Harry, do you think it
might be a little bit harder

20:45.945 --> 20:49.614
to meet new friends
if you're with me all the time?

20:49.732 --> 20:51.598

spending time with you.

with you, too.

want to hang out

I do. But you're right.

all over again.

21:11.254 --> 21:12.920
I get that.

21:18.311 --> 21:20.127
So, what are you saying?

21:20.263 --> 21:23.797
Maybe for right now,

21:23.933 --> 21:26.467
it would be better
for both of us to

21:26.569 --> 21:28.019
take a break from hanging out.

21:28.137 --> 21:31.439
(sighs) I was afraid
that's where this was going.

Not forever. Just a pause,

a little more.

Do you own thing.
Find your own<i> amigos.</i>

You are gonna make
