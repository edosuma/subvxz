WEBVTT

00:31.990 --> 00:33.408
Bobbi:
Lexi...

00:34.659 --> 00:35.994
We're ready.

01:49.818 --> 01:52.237
Person 1:
Wasn't it a lovely memorial?

01:52.237 --> 01:55.907
Person 2:
Oh, yes. It was up.
It wasn't down at all.

01:58.827 --> 02:01.579
Grandma:
A good heart,
and, you know,

02:01.663 --> 02:04.666
she takes after him.

02:04.666 --> 02:06.167
Gia:
Thanks, Grandma.

02:08.795 --> 02:12.131
- It was so warm and from the heart.
- Yes, it was.

02:12.215 --> 02:14.717
- It was just-- It was lovely, dear.
- Wasn't it, wasn't it?

02:14.801 --> 02:18.012
You know what?
He was a special man.

02:18.096 --> 02:20.390
Neighbor:
Did he have
life insurance?

02:20.390 --> 02:22.851
Leslie:
Uh... a little bit.

02:26.312 --> 02:28.731
We'll figure it out.

02:28.815 --> 02:30.692
Neighbor:
But he was young.

02:30.692 --> 02:33.403
Leslie:
Yeah, he, he was young.

02:33.403 --> 02:37.907
Neighbor:
Are you gonna be able to--
The house, the kids?

02:37.991 --> 02:41.035
- Leslie: We'll figure it out.
- Neighbor: Good, good.

02:41.119 --> 02:44.247
- It's, it's gotta be a relief.
- Thank you.

02:44.247 --> 02:45.456
Thank you for coming.

02:52.171 --> 02:55.633
- Hey.
- How's it goin' over there?

02:57.135 --> 03:00.430
- Leslie: She's asking me all these questions.
- Suze: Oh, yeah?

03:09.856 --> 03:12.567
- She skipped class.
- Is anyone gonna check on her?

03:12.567 --> 03:14.527
- Is Rue in her room?
- Yeah.

03:14.611 --> 03:18.031
- She hasn't opened the door.
- Do you think she's okay?

03:18.031 --> 03:21.242
Don't just stand here
and gossip. It's rude.

03:22.619 --> 03:23.745
Rue?

03:25.204 --> 03:27.332
- Hey.
- Rue: Hey.

03:40.511 --> 03:42.055
These were my dad's.

03:45.141 --> 03:47.268
How are you feeling?

03:54.233 --> 03:59.322
Yeah.
I... found this poem,
and I thought of you.

03:59.322 --> 04:01.574
Rue: If it's
C.S. Lewis, I can't.

04:01.658 --> 04:05.078
- No, it's not. I promise.
- Every hospice nurse says

04:05.078 --> 04:08.373
that "Grief is a long valley."

04:08.373 --> 04:10.667
Yeah, but that's
not the full quote.

04:12.251 --> 04:15.505
Yeah, well, it's enough for me.

04:15.505 --> 04:17.632
Well,
the second part's
kind of sweet.

04:18.424 --> 04:19.926
Rue: What is it?

04:21.386 --> 04:25.431
Uh, "A winding valley
where every bend...

04:25.515 --> 04:28.267
may reveal a new landscape."

04:32.271 --> 04:33.773
That's not that bad.

04:41.531 --> 04:43.282
Can I read this to you?

04:47.161 --> 04:48.913
Uh, yeah, I'd love that.

04:54.669 --> 04:55.795
Uh...

04:57.338 --> 05:00.341
It's called
"Let This Darkness
Be a Bell Tower"

05:00.425 --> 05:02.552
by Rainer Maria Rilke.

05:09.058 --> 05:12.061
"Quiet friend who
has come so far,

05:12.145 --> 05:16.232
"feel how your breathing
makes more space around you.

05:25.616 --> 05:31.956
"Let this darkness
be a bell tower
and you the bell.

05:32.040 --> 05:37.295
"As you ring, what batters
you becomes your strength.

05:37.295 --> 05:41.007
"Move back and forth
into the change.

05:42.216 --> 05:46.429
"What is it like,
such intensity of pain?

05:46.429 --> 05:50.767
"If the drink is bitter,
turn yourself into wine.

05:52.018 --> 05:54.562
"In this uncontainable night,

05:54.562 --> 05:59.734
"be the mystery
at the crossroads
of your senses,

05:59.734 --> 06:01.944
"the meaning discovered there.

06:03.196 --> 06:06.240
"And if the world has
ceased to hear you,

06:06.324 --> 06:09.702
"say to the silent
earth: I flow.

06:09.786 --> 06:14.082
To the rushing water,
speak: I am."

07:05.550 --> 07:07.718
Lexi
<i>I knew Jade had
been doing drugs,</i>

07:07.802 --> 07:09.804
<i>but it wasn't until that day,</i>

07:09.804 --> 07:11.514
<i>at her dad's memorial,</i>

07:11.514 --> 07:14.058
<i>that I realized they
were a greater comfort</i>

07:14.142 --> 07:16.352
<i>than I ever could be.</i>

07:16.352 --> 07:18.271
<i>Maybe that's
a silly observation,</i>

07:18.271 --> 07:20.439
<i>but I was only 13.</i>

07:22.275 --> 07:25.570
<i>It was the summer before
I started ninth grade...</i>

07:25.570 --> 07:28.364
<i>back when we thought we'd
all be friends forever.</i>

07:34.328 --> 07:35.496
Move.

07:37.039 --> 07:38.166
Move, move, move!

07:39.500 --> 07:41.085
Lights, four, go.

07:43.629 --> 07:45.464
Lexi:
<i>There were five of us.</i>

07:47.300 --> 07:48.759
<i>There was me, Grace...</i>

07:52.263 --> 07:55.641
<i>♪ Love will keep us together ♪</i>

07:55.725 --> 07:57.894
<i>♪ Think of me babe, whenever ♪</i>

07:57.894 --> 07:59.562
Lexi:
<i>My sister, Hallie...</i>

07:59.562 --> 08:03.191

girl comes along ♪</i>

08:03.191 --> 08:05.067
<i>♪ Singing her song ♪</i>

08:05.151 --> 08:06.652

08:06.736 --> 08:10.198

08:10.198 --> 08:12.575
<i>♪ 'Cause I really

Lexi:

08:16.204 --> 08:18.915

08:23.211 --> 08:25.087

08:28.257 --> 08:30.301
Bring out the fucking
letters now.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.393
Lexi:
<i>And this is life.</i>

08:42.188 --> 08:43.898
<i>Not everyone's life...</i>

08:45.316 --> 08:46.859
But our life!

08:53.616 --> 08:57.203
Audience Member: Oh, that's fuckin' cool.

09:01.207 --> 09:03.834
Wait, is this
fucking play about us?

09:13.052 --> 09:14.804
Rue:
<i>For the last few months,</i>

09:14.804 --> 09:17.265
<i>Lexi had been talking
to Fezco every day.</i>

09:17.265 --> 09:22.270
But I still don't understand
what the play is actually
about, though.

09:22.270 --> 09:25.273
Lexi
<i>It's about friendship.</i>

09:25.273 --> 09:28.859
Well, that's nice.
Everybody's gonna love that.

09:28.943 --> 09:30.528
Yeah, I-I mean, I hope so.

09:30.528 --> 09:33.114
I just-- I keep
second-guessing myself

09:33.114 --> 09:35.283
and getting anxious, like,
if people are gonna think

09:35.283 --> 09:36.784
that it's good or bad,

09:36.784 --> 09:40.204
or if it's gonna
upset people or not.

09:40.288 --> 09:42.790
But why would anyone
be upset by it?

09:42.790 --> 09:46.252
Lexi:
<i>Oh, you know, it's, it's
based on real people.</i>

09:46.252 --> 09:50.631
Fezco:
<i>Yeah, you really strokin'
the bee's nest with that one.</i>

09:50.715 --> 09:53.759
- Am I?
- I mean...

09:53.843 --> 09:56.512
if someone invited me
to a play, and...

09:56.596 --> 09:59.765
they didn't even tell me
I was a character in it?

09:59.849 --> 10:01.726
I'd definitely
have some questions.

10:01.726 --> 10:03.853
Lexi:
Like, bad questions?

10:03.853 --> 10:05.855
Fezco:
<i>Depends on the play.</i>

10:05.855 --> 10:08.316
Lexi:
Well, would you
be upset by it?

10:08.316 --> 10:10.860
Fezco:
<i>It depends on the play.</i>

10:10.860 --> 10:14.864
- Right.
- Fezco: <i>And the intentions of the person who made the play.</i>

10:14.864 --> 10:17.199
My intentions are good.

10:17.283 --> 10:20.703
Fezco:
<i>Then you ain't got
nothin' to worry about.</i>

10:20.703 --> 10:25.499
But... what if they think
my intentions aren't good

10:25.583 --> 10:27.752
when in reality they are good?

10:27.752 --> 10:30.046
Well, that's what
I call a quandary.

10:31.088 --> 10:32.757
Lexi:
<i>What's the answer?</i>

10:32.757 --> 10:36.677
Uh, wait, what was
the question again?

10:36.761 --> 10:40.222
Like, what happens if
Cassie sees the play

10:40.306 --> 10:43.517
and thinks I'm being cruel,
even though I'm not?

10:43.601 --> 10:45.936
Well, how about you just
don't invite her then?

10:46.020 --> 10:47.938
No, she'd get so mad.

10:48.022 --> 10:51.734
Fezco:
<i>Even more mad than if she
actually saw the play?</i>

10:52.651 --> 10:54.779
That's-- I don't know.

10:58.616 --> 11:00.659
Lexi:
Okay, this might kinda be

11:00.743 --> 11:03.204
a weird and embarrassing
thing to admit,

11:03.204 --> 11:06.582
but I think the most defining
moment of my adolescence

11:06.582 --> 11:09.085
was when my sister
went through puberty.

11:12.797 --> 11:15.800
Uck, I look disgusting.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.010
Hey, Hallie,
I'm in the middle
of somethin'.

11:18.094 --> 11:20.763
It's just this dress
is so not flattering.

11:20.763 --> 11:25.101
- Lexi: Hallie, I'm kinda puttin' on a play right now.
- Hallie: What?

11:25.101 --> 11:26.685
Lexi:
Like, there's
an entire audience

11:26.769 --> 11:28.104
waiting for me
to continue talking.

11:28.104 --> 11:31.732
Hallie: Where?

11:31.816 --> 11:33.192
Right here.

11:34.151 --> 11:37.113
Oh,
Hi. Wow.

11:39.824 --> 11:42.743
Whatever.
The point is,
I couldn't wait

11:42.827 --> 11:44.370
to go through puberty.

11:45.246 --> 11:47.957
Wow, wow, wow!

11:47.957 --> 11:51.460
Mother: Look at you!

11:51.544 --> 11:55.464
- I feel like a big baby.
- Hallie...

11:55.548 --> 11:58.759
I've been on this planet
for 38 goddamn years,

11:58.843 --> 12:03.139
and I have never seen a baby
with knockers like yours.

12:04.640 --> 12:08.060
Hallie:
Mom, that was the grossest
thing I've ever heard you say.

12:08.144 --> 12:11.105
Mother
Okay.

12:11.105 --> 12:12.731
Lights, 12, go.

12:12.815 --> 12:16.652
Look, I know being informed,
smart, hardworking, and curious

12:16.652 --> 12:18.404
are all very
important qualities,

12:18.404 --> 12:23.909
but imagine having
all of those qualities
and also being hot.

12:23.993 --> 12:27.705
So, if Hallie was
433 days older than me,

12:27.705 --> 12:31.167
then all I would
have to do is wait...

12:31.167 --> 12:35.504
433 days,
and I'd look just like her.

12:59.904 --> 13:04.116
Yo, Ash, get the door, man.

13:09.079 --> 13:10.915
Okay, I need you
to pull it way back.

13:10.915 --> 13:13.209
You're too broad.
It's not funny.

13:16.045 --> 13:18.297
Oh my god.
Are you crying?

13:18.297 --> 13:21.842
It's a directorial note.
You just take it
and move on, okay?

13:23.427 --> 13:25.387
Hey, I need the light
cues to be 40% faster,

13:25.471 --> 13:27.848
- and the stagehands to be 20% faster.
- Bobbi: Copy that.

13:27.932 --> 13:32.478
Ew! God! What the--
Did someone die
in this dress?!

13:32.478 --> 13:35.147
It smells like shit.

13:39.193 --> 13:40.653
I love the theater.

13:40.653 --> 13:43.030
What we got
goin' on?

13:43.030 --> 13:46.659
- Freshly steamed.
- Ooh.

13:47.618 --> 13:49.370
Yes, yes, yes.

13:50.162 --> 13:51.705
You da best.

13:53.040 --> 13:56.293
Mmm.
Yeah, we steppin'
out tonight.

13:57.795 --> 13:59.755
Ooh, bless your heart.

14:02.466 --> 14:06.762
Nah, I really
do appreciate you
doin' that, though.

14:08.097 --> 14:10.599
Custer:
Damn, what's good?

14:10.683 --> 14:12.476
Yo, wassup, man?

14:12.560 --> 14:14.436
Yo, I'm, I'm,
actually, a little busy.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.897
I'm, I'm gettin'
ready to go out.

14:17.773 --> 14:19.191
We goin' to a party?

14:19.817 --> 14:21.151
Where you goin'?

14:21.235 --> 14:25.364
Don't worry about
what I'm doin', man.
Worry about yourself.

14:25.364 --> 14:28.117
All right.
I'mma just chill then.

15:09.116 --> 15:10.951
This is your dream.

15:12.536 --> 15:13.579
Mick...

15:13.579 --> 15:16.040
<i>don't screw this up.</i>

15:16.040 --> 15:17.666
<i>Lights, 12, go.</i>

15:19.835 --> 15:21.795
I could see myself now.

15:23.339 --> 15:25.382
- Audience Member: Damn! Shit!
- I'd be the girl...

15:25.466 --> 15:28.719
- no one ever... could get.
- Audience Member: Is that Lexi?

15:28.719 --> 15:32.514
Hi.

15:32.598 --> 15:35.517
- Hey, Ted, how are you?
- Woo!

15:35.601 --> 15:37.978
Audience Member:
Damn! Oh shit!

15:38.062 --> 15:41.607
Hey, boys.
How are you?

15:41.607 --> 15:42.816
Audience Member:
Shit!

15:42.900 --> 15:45.819
And I'd imagine my
former classmates...

15:45.903 --> 15:47.488
sitting around
at barbecues

15:47.488 --> 15:49.573
in their dirty,
dirty backyards

15:49.657 --> 15:50.991
20 years from now.

15:51.075 --> 15:54.745
Man... I really wish
I'd boned Lexi Howard.

15:54.745 --> 15:56.914
Yeah,
you and the rest
of East Highland.

16:00.167 --> 16:02.336
All I had to do was wait.

16:07.549 --> 16:09.718
Light, 86, go.

16:17.893 --> 16:21.605
- Look, Lexi, some guys prefer smaller boobs.
- Lexi: Yeah?

16:23.440 --> 16:25.109
I mean, if you and I
could trade bodies,

16:25.109 --> 16:26.819
I'd do it in a heartbeat.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.488
- Well maybe they're still growing.
- No, they're not.

16:29.488 --> 16:32.866
- Well, sometimes, it takes--
- No, they're fully formed.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.871
To be honest,
I'm not really
the kind of person

16:37.955 --> 16:39.998
who wants to be
known for their body.

16:47.047 --> 16:50.467
But I also didn't
want the troubles
that came along with it.

16:52.428 --> 16:56.348
Hallie:
I wasn't even looking
at him, I swear.

16:56.432 --> 16:58.809
You're the only person
I've ever dreamed of.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.456
Well, she certainly
looks the part.

17:27.880 --> 17:32.176
Lexi:
<i>I feel like I've lived most
of my life in my imagination.</i>

17:36.889 --> 17:38.932
<i>Taking the smallest moments</i>

17:39.016 --> 17:42.227
<i>and dreaming them up
into something bigger.</i>

17:46.815 --> 17:48.275
Fezco
<i>Of course,
I'mma be there.</i>

17:48.275 --> 17:51.236
<i>I'mma be sittin' in
the front row, shorty.</i>

17:52.237 --> 17:55.657
<i>- I promise you that.</i>
- Okay.

17:59.411 --> 18:02.915
<i>A little exchange
and I fall in love.</i>

18:11.465 --> 18:15.385
<i>A moment to myself
and I'm onstage.</i>

18:25.479 --> 18:29.358
<i>But reality always finds
a way of pulling me back.</i>

18:31.693 --> 18:34.154
Do you think he's okay?

18:34.238 --> 18:36.240
I think he's just sleeping.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.158
It's the middle
of the day.

18:47.918 --> 18:50.879
I think we should have
Mom come pick us up.

18:50.963 --> 18:55.509
- Don't be rude.
- It doesn't matter if it's rude.

18:55.509 --> 18:58.220
I don't want him
to think that we
don't trust him.

18:59.596 --> 19:01.431
Gus:
Come on, girls.

19:02.182 --> 19:03.851
Get in the car.

19:08.438 --> 19:09.731
Come on, Lex.

19:54.776 --> 19:58.822
Rue:
Uh, I just need, like, like
an eighth of weed. That's all.

19:58.906 --> 20:00.908
- Fezco: I can help with that.
- All right.

20:00.908 --> 20:03.201
Uh, yo, I'll just
be a second.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.678
I think before high school
we should think about

20:21.762 --> 20:24.514
all the things we don't
like about ourselves...

20:24.598 --> 20:27.643
and then change them,
so we can be, like,

20:27.643 --> 20:30.812
like, different,
cooler people.

20:30.896 --> 20:32.731
I don't think we
need to be cooler.

20:32.731 --> 20:35.692
Lexi:
Well, we should at least
try and know what's cool.

20:35.776 --> 20:38.779
Jade:
Yeah, but that shit, like,
changes all the time.

20:38.779 --> 20:41.114
Lexi:
That's what makes
it hard to follow.

20:41.198 --> 20:43.951
Jade:
Yeah, but I think
it's a good thing.

20:43.951 --> 20:47.913
But... what if
we get excluded
from things?

20:47.913 --> 20:50.332
That's also
a good thing.

20:50.332 --> 20:53.168
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:53.168 --> 20:56.296
My dad says
he refuses to be
a part of any club

20:56.380 --> 20:57.923
that would have
him as a member.

20:59.007 --> 21:00.342
Lexi:
Well, that's cool.

21:00.342 --> 21:04.304
Yeah, don't tell anyone.
They'll fuckin' ruin it.

21:08.725 --> 21:12.896
Jade was the first person
who made me feel okay
about not being cool.

21:12.980 --> 21:14.314
Lights, 10, go.

21:16.191 --> 21:17.526
Lexi:
<i>I just feel like in 10 years,</i>

21:17.526 --> 21:19.236
<i>technology's gonna
get really scary,</i>

21:19.236 --> 21:21.446
<i>and we're all gonna
wish we'd never used it.</i>

21:21.530 --> 21:23.323
What are you
talking about?

21:23.407 --> 21:26.118
Well,
all these tech companies
are simultaneously

21:26.118 --> 21:28.328
developing artificial
intelligence and robotics,

21:28.412 --> 21:30.247
so it's only a matter
of time before they

21:30.247 --> 21:32.124
become the new
military-industrial complex

21:32.124 --> 21:34.376
and start making killer robots.

21:34.376 --> 21:35.794
I think there's
a big difference

21:35.794 --> 21:38.797
between taking selfies
and killer robots.

21:38.797 --> 21:41.299
Yeah, maybe now,
but that gap will close.

21:44.970 --> 21:47.597
But anyway,
back to where I was.

21:47.681 --> 21:50.392
<i>We talked and laughed
for hours that night.</i>

21:51.435 --> 21:53.895
<i>I miss those days.</i>

21:53.979 --> 21:58.442
It was before my dad left
and Jade's dad died.

21:58.442 --> 22:00.694
Before Jade got
into heavy drugs,

22:00.694 --> 22:03.405
and before I got
inside my head.

22:05.282 --> 22:07.325
It was before
we grew apart,

22:07.409 --> 22:09.536
and before I started
doubting myself

22:09.536 --> 22:13.540
every time someone
would ask me if Jade
was my best friend.

22:16.376 --> 22:19.421
"Let this darkness
be a bell tower...

22:20.422 --> 22:22.257
and you the bell."

22:25.594 --> 22:28.930
Feel like I don't
know anything about
your life anymore.

22:30.640 --> 22:32.851
I'll tell you
when you get back.

22:36.605 --> 22:38.899
- Good night.
- Good night.

22:43.528 --> 22:47.616
Um... do you ever worry
as you get older...

22:49.034 --> 22:51.661
you'll have
less and less
memories of Dad?

22:54.706 --> 22:55.916
Yeah.

22:59.377 --> 23:02.214
Gia: How do you stop
that from happening?

23:09.554 --> 23:10.931
You can't.

23:24.611 --> 23:30.325
I... I remember
a couple of days before
you passed away...

23:31.701 --> 23:34.413
you told me...

23:34.413 --> 23:36.706
that if I ever wanted
to be with you...

23:38.625 --> 23:41.128
all I would have to do
is close my eyes...

23:42.671 --> 23:45.674
and we'd be together.

23:45.674 --> 23:50.011
You said that...
memories exist
outside of time.

how my sister and I</i>

25:37.077 --> 25:41.081
<i>had so many of the same
wishes growing up...</i>

25:41.081 --> 25:43.583
<i>and how different we became.</i>

26:05.772 --> 26:09.985
Lexi:
<i>At that age, we all thought
we knew what love looked like.</i>

26:15.824 --> 26:20.245
<i>And we had our suspicions
of what it felt like.</i>

26:20.245 --> 26:23.540
<i>But that's also what
made it so intoxicating.</i>

26:24.874 --> 26:28.003
<i>None of us had any idea
what it actually was.</i>

26:30.463 --> 26:32.507
I don't think there's
anything more beautiful

26:32.507 --> 26:35.635
than dedicating your
life to loving someone.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.476
<i>I think that's
my biggest dream...</i>

26:46.021 --> 26:47.522
<i>To be your girl...</i>

26:51.484 --> 26:53.695
<i>To love you
more than anything.</i>

27:22.932 --> 27:25.060
You could never scare me.

27:40.283 --> 27:42.869
I don't know if
I wanna do this.

27:42.869 --> 27:45.497
It's just weed.
It's not heroin.

28:00.595 --> 28:03.223
Fezco:
Lexi wildin' out today.

28:04.682 --> 28:07.936
- You okay?
- My god, that really burns.

28:10.480 --> 28:12.399
Lexi: <i>My whole life,
I've always had this feeling</i>

28:12.399 --> 28:16.277
<i>that at any moment,
something horrible
was about to happen.</i>

28:27.372 --> 28:28.581
Psst.

28:37.257 --> 28:38.466
Faye!

28:38.550 --> 28:39.634
Come here.

29:06.870 --> 29:09.330
Be cool.

29:10.874 --> 29:12.250
I love you.

29:25.763 --> 29:28.475
- Fezco: Yo, Faye!
- Faye: Yeah?

29:28.475 --> 29:30.768
Fezco:
Come here for a split second.

29:31.853 --> 29:33.313
I'll be right there.

29:54.250 --> 29:56.794
Tie or no tie?

30:00.882 --> 30:02.634
- You okay?
- Um...

30:04.219 --> 30:05.762
Yeah, I'm good.

30:12.185 --> 30:15.063
Yo, you got her
lookin' like that,

30:15.063 --> 30:17.232
that white guy
with the afro.

30:17.232 --> 30:18.858
He be paintin' on TV.

30:18.942 --> 30:20.777
Fuckin' Bob Ross.

30:20.777 --> 30:24.072
- She looks like Bob Ross.
- Fezco: Bobby, Bobby, it's a fire!

30:24.072 --> 30:26.366
- We gotta, We gotta go. We gotta go. Yeah.
- It's a fire! C'mon, c'mon!

30:29.369 --> 30:31.663
Lexi:
I don't think
I like weed.

30:32.956 --> 30:36.459
Rue:
Yeah, well, that's...
crazy talk.

30:36.543 --> 30:42.924
I just can't control
my brain the same way...
I normally can.

30:42.924 --> 30:45.635
Yeah, but that's,
like, the best part.

30:51.140 --> 30:55.603
All right, well,
see ya later, homie.
Good night.

30:57.564 --> 30:59.065
Get home safe.

31:01.025 --> 31:02.151
Okay.

31:04.529 --> 31:06.239
Lexi:
<i>I think Jade used drugs</i>

31:06.239 --> 31:08.491
<i>to push away
all the bad thoughts.</i>

31:08.575 --> 31:11.578
But it did
the opposite for me.

31:13.997 --> 31:16.916
<i>All I could think about
were the bad thoughts.</i>

31:28.678 --> 31:31.222
<i>The things that
could go wrong...</i>

31:31.306 --> 31:33.558
the people I could lose...

31:33.558 --> 31:37.937
and the million and one reasons
why I'm not good enough.

31:52.243 --> 31:55.955
Rue:
<i>Jules and I hadn't spoken since
that bullshit intervention.</i>

31:58.207 --> 32:00.251
<i>Even though I see her around.</i>

32:12.263 --> 32:15.558
<i>It's funny how I used to think
we were meant for each other.</i>

32:19.020 --> 32:21.189
<i>That feels like
a lifetime ago.</i>

32:34.744 --> 32:36.079
What's up?

33:07.860 --> 33:09.404
Leslie:
You broke me.

33:12.657 --> 33:14.784
Completely broke me.

33:18.538 --> 33:20.331
I give up.

33:20.415 --> 33:22.375
Hey...

33:22.375 --> 33:24.919
you wanna kill
yourself doin' drugs?
Go ahead.

33:24.919 --> 33:26.796
I'm not gonna
stand in your way.

33:29.507 --> 33:31.592
- So I can do drugs?
- Yeah.

33:31.676 --> 33:34.929
- Anything I want?
- The world's your oyster.

33:38.349 --> 33:41.060
- Mom, are you fucking with me right now?
- No.

33:41.144 --> 33:44.564
If you wanna fry every last
brain cell in your head,

33:44.564 --> 33:45.732
go ahead.

33:45.732 --> 33:48.276
What? What?

33:48.276 --> 33:50.486
- That's exciting to you, huh?
- What?

33:50.570 --> 33:51.738
Bein' a crackhead?

33:51.738 --> 33:54.240
I just feel like
there's a catch here.

33:54.240 --> 33:57.326
I can't convince you that
your life is important.

33:57.410 --> 34:00.621
You're gonna have to make
that decision on your own.

34:00.705 --> 34:05.251
You'll be 18 soon...
and outta my house.

34:05.251 --> 34:08.629
And you're gonna make whatever
decisions you're gonna make.

34:11.674 --> 34:13.426
I'm takin' you off my plate.

34:17.597 --> 34:19.265
Okay.

34:19.265 --> 34:21.100
I'm gonna
focus on Gia.

34:22.894 --> 34:24.479
Yeah, but she's fine, though.

34:26.355 --> 34:28.357
She's been gettin'
D's in math.

34:29.776 --> 34:30.693
Yeah.

34:30.777 --> 34:32.320
She's been
in detention

34:32.320 --> 34:35.490
three times in
the past two weeks.

34:35.490 --> 34:37.825
And every mornin',
when I go into her room

34:37.909 --> 34:38.951
to make sure
she's awake,

34:39.035 --> 34:41.621
she already up...
on the phone.

34:41.621 --> 34:44.582
And I know she's not
getting any sleep.

34:44.582 --> 34:49.003
But if you say she's fine...
I'll just take your word for it.

34:53.174 --> 34:54.717
I didn't know any of that.

34:55.802 --> 34:57.595
Leslie:
Why would you?

34:57.595 --> 34:59.889
You only ever think
about yourself.

35:03.184 --> 35:04.519
That's not true, Mom.

35:07.522 --> 35:10.983
If I have to choose between
losin' one daughter or two?

35:12.443 --> 35:14.195
I'mma fight to save her.

35:23.579 --> 35:25.123
Nah, that's fair.

35:28.835 --> 35:32.088
Move it, move it, move it.

35:32.088 --> 35:35.049
Lexi:
<i>When Hallie and Marta

36:41.741 --> 36:46.579
<i>I had never seen anyone
as sure of themself as her.</i>

36:46.579 --> 36:49.165
<i>Because of that,
I didn't really trust her.</i>

36:49.165 --> 36:51.500
Woo!

36:55.755 --> 36:57.798
Lexi:
<i>Until her parents started
fighting all the time</i>

36:57.882 --> 37:01.093
<i>and she basically moved in
with us for a few months.</i>

37:06.557 --> 37:07.892
D'ya like it?

37:07.892 --> 37:09.393
I feel stupid.

37:09.477 --> 37:11.979
What?
Everyone feels stupid.
Who cares?

37:12.063 --> 37:14.190
- You feel stupid?
- Yeah, I did.

37:14.190 --> 37:18.361
And then, I just chose
not to feel stupid.

37:18.361 --> 37:23.449
I don't know if... I can...
really get to that point.

37:23.449 --> 37:25.868
90% of life
is confidence.

37:25.952 --> 37:29.246
And the thing about
confidence is no one
knows if it's real or not.

37:32.291 --> 37:34.543
Okay, okay, I'm not
runnin' a brothel here.

37:34.627 --> 37:37.254
All right, girls?
It's time for bed.

37:37.338 --> 37:39.340
It's supposed to be me.

37:39.340 --> 37:41.592
Oh, that's supposed to be me.

37:41.676 --> 37:46.263
All righty, beauty queens.
It's time for bed. Good night.

37:46.347 --> 37:48.683
Mother
Good night, sugar pops.

37:53.813 --> 37:55.022
Hallie: Marta...

37:57.066 --> 37:58.401
Marta:
Yeah?

37:59.944 --> 38:02.154
Hallie:
You can sleep in
my bed if you want.

38:16.377 --> 38:20.381
My parents used to fight
all the time, too, so I get it.

38:22.133 --> 38:24.719
You can stay here
as long as you want.

38:39.984 --> 38:42.528
Maddy:
Open the fucking door, Cassie.

38:42.528 --> 38:44.697
Open the door
and tell me it was worth it.

38:44.697 --> 38:46.073
You owe me that.

38:49.827 --> 38:52.663
Open the fucking door, Cassie!

38:53.831 --> 38:55.583
What kind of fucking
friend are you?

38:55.583 --> 38:57.585
What the fuck?

38:57.585 --> 38:58.836
This isn't
about Nate.

38:58.836 --> 39:00.755
This is about
you and me

39:00.755 --> 39:02.256
and our friendship,
and if you wanna

39:02.256 --> 39:04.425
throw it away,
then fine.

39:04.425 --> 39:08.095
'Cause I don't wanna be
fucking friends with you.

39:08.179 --> 39:10.389
Kat:
Come here, babe.
Let's go.

39:11.682 --> 39:14.935
I'm just sick of it.
I'm sick of it.

39:15.019 --> 39:18.731
He put me through hell
and now he's with
my fucking best friend?

39:18.731 --> 39:21.067
Like, what the fuck?

39:21.067 --> 39:24.236
- Kat: It's fucked up.
- When is it gonna end?

39:24.320 --> 39:25.738
Kat:
It's fucked up.

39:31.494 --> 39:33.829
Maddy:
Open the fucking door, Cassie!

39:33.913 --> 39:35.790
Open the fucking door!

39:35.790 --> 39:37.458
Kat:
She's not gonna open it.
Let's just go.

39:37.458 --> 39:39.126
Maddy:
Open the door!

39:39.210 --> 39:42.296
Kat: Maddy, come on.

39:42.296 --> 39:44.924
You're a fucking coward.

39:46.050 --> 39:47.259
You're a fucking coward,

39:47.343 --> 39:50.387
and I would've never
done this to you.

39:50.471 --> 39:52.890
I would've never
done this to you.

42:04.480 --> 42:06.941
Am I everything
you wished for?

42:28.295 --> 42:31.298
<i>I would love
for you to fuck me...</i>

42:31.382 --> 42:35.261
<i>whenever and...
however you want.</i>

42:39.390 --> 42:41.976
You can control
what I wear...

42:43.060 --> 42:44.353
what I eat...

42:49.900 --> 42:51.860
who I talk to.

42:55.906 --> 42:59.201
<i>I want every guy you know
to wanna fuck me...</i>

43:00.369 --> 43:02.121
<i>but they can't.</i>

43:03.706 --> 43:06.083
<i>Because they know I'm yours.</i>

43:07.293 --> 43:09.044
I belong to you...

43:11.171 --> 43:13.465
and I will
never complain

43:13.549 --> 43:16.176
because I trust
you know what's best.

43:25.102 --> 43:28.314
Aren't you afraid people
are gonna look down on ya?

43:32.776 --> 43:34.528
At least I'm loved.

43:49.084 --> 43:51.045
Lexi:
<i>Jake and Marta's relationship</i>

43:51.045 --> 43:53.756
<i>was our first
impression of love.</i>

43:55.507 --> 43:58.510
No one's ever loved me
as much as you.

43:58.594 --> 44:00.137
No one ever will.

45:47.995 --> 45:50.289
Shh, shh, shh.

45:53.375 --> 45:54.960
It's just a dream.

45:56.295 --> 45:59.506
Shh... Quiet.

46:25.199 --> 46:28.494
Lexi:
<i>But every relationship
has its cracks.</i>

46:31.079 --> 46:33.624
<i>Some bigger than others.</i>

46:36.293 --> 46:39.713
- I'm afraid to tell him.
- Mm-hm.

46:39.797 --> 46:42.382
Do you think
he's gonna cry?

46:42.466 --> 46:46.136
- He might.
- Mm, don't say that.

46:46.220 --> 46:48.597
But he might.

46:48.597 --> 46:50.224
I just feel bad.

46:52.059 --> 46:54.978
Bad enough to stay
in East Highland for
the rest of your life?

46:55.854 --> 46:57.105
Fuck no.

46:58.440 --> 47:00.651
Oh, you've made
your decision.

47:03.612 --> 47:05.822
I just feel
like I'm gonna
break his heart.

47:06.949 --> 47:08.826
It's good practice.

47:12.579 --> 47:14.081
I got you something.

47:14.081 --> 47:16.792
- What? You didn't have to.
- I know.

47:19.378 --> 47:21.213
Somethin' tells me
you'll enjoy it.

47:49.491 --> 47:51.034
Ugh, hurry up!

47:52.661 --> 47:53.912
Okay, this is it, people!

47:53.996 --> 47:56.873
It's fuckin' showtime!
Let's go!

47:56.957 --> 47:59.793
I need more energy, passion!

47:59.793 --> 48:02.337
- More glycerol, Sarah.
- But it makes my skin break out.

48:02.421 --> 48:03.755
I don't fuckin' care.

48:05.382 --> 48:06.717
- You ready?
- Yeah, I'm fuckin' ready.

48:06.717 --> 48:08.176
- Yeah, you ready?
- Yeah, I'm fuckin' re--

48:10.846 --> 48:13.849
Okay, Bobbi.
if Mick fucks up
another light cue,

48:13.849 --> 48:14.975
I'm gonna fuckin' kill him.

48:14.975 --> 48:16.184
Bobbi:
Mick, you were
two seconds

48:16.268 --> 48:17.394
too late
on that light cue.

48:17.394 --> 48:19.062
Lexi is very
angry with you.

48:20.439 --> 48:22.399
Copy that.
I'm really sorry.

48:25.527 --> 48:27.696
- Bobbi: He says sorry.
- Okay, I don't fuckin' care.

48:27.696 --> 48:29.781
Tell him we'll replace him.

48:29.865 --> 48:33.368
- We don't have anyone to replace him with.
- Just threaten him.

48:34.870 --> 48:37.414
Mick, I am relaying
a message directly
from Lexi.

48:37.414 --> 48:40.042
<i>If you mess up again,
we will replace you.</i>

48:40.042 --> 48:41.501
With who?

48:41.585 --> 48:44.880
- He's asking with who.
- Literally anybody. Any--

48:44.880 --> 48:49.593
Mick, Mick, y-you--

do a better job than you.
