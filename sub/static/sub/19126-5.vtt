WEBVTT

00:00.023 --> 00:01.351
Do it.

00:02.063 --> 00:03.633
I'm sorry.

00:06.633 --> 00:08.475
<i>I'll do the time.</i>

00:08.500 --> 00:10.267
You drive me to the police
station right now.

00:10.269 --> 00:12.669
- It's too late.
- I have to go now.

00:15.741 --> 00:17.808
<i>I think you and Des
have a little side business.</i>

00:18.844 --> 00:20.110
I want a cut.

00:20.112 --> 00:21.411
Everything's my fault
even though

00:21.413 --> 00:23.544
I'm the one who told you
to stay away from Grady!

00:23.569 --> 00:26.249
<i>I told you he came after my kid!</i>

00:26.251 --> 00:29.186
I couldn't live with myself
if I made a decision

00:29.188 --> 00:32.055
based on something he said
in a moment of fear.

00:32.057 --> 00:33.723
What should I do?

00:33.725 --> 00:36.760
<i>You think Grant is the son of
Lucas Grant, Judge Lucas Grant.</i>

00:36.762 --> 00:37.861
He could have done
a clinical trial.

00:37.863 --> 00:39.062
He could've done
a million things.

00:39.064 --> 00:41.598
What he could not have done
was give consent.

00:41.600 --> 00:42.966
She's going to say
you had sex, Ben.

00:42.968 --> 00:44.935
And no one is gonna believe her

00:44.937 --> 00:46.903
if we get rid of the tape.

00:46.905 --> 00:50.240
I was born sick, born broken.

00:50.242 --> 00:51.808
<i>So I met with Morgan.</i>

00:51.810 --> 00:53.643
He wants to wave the white flag.

00:54.780 --> 00:56.780
- Am I under arrest?
- Let's go.

00:56.782 --> 00:58.248
He wears a wire,
gathers evidence

00:58.250 --> 00:59.783
against his partner.

00:59.785 --> 01:01.118
We offer him immunity.

01:01.120 --> 01:02.986
We will get back to you.

01:02.988 --> 01:05.689
<i>Mary Mitchell,
now known as Mary Harris,</i>

01:05.691 --> 01:07.824
was investigated
for the murder of her mother.

01:07.826 --> 01:09.626
Her mother was found dead
in Chalk Lake

01:09.628 --> 01:11.294
with her hands tied together.

01:11.296 --> 01:13.163
<i>Man, you don't know
who this woman is.</i>

01:13.165 --> 01:14.464
<i>She's been involved in the death</i>

01:14.466 --> 01:16.099
<i>of God knows how many people.</i>

01:16.101 --> 01:18.186
Am I crazy like Mom?

01:24.910 --> 01:27.144
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

01:27.146 --> 01:28.411
<i>What?</i>

01:28.413 --> 01:30.780
<i>Saving people
a trip to Switzerland.</i>

01:30.782 --> 01:32.516
<i>I believe</i>

01:32.518 --> 01:35.285
<i>we should be in control
of our life and our death.</i>

01:35.287 --> 01:36.753
<i>That's liberty.</i>

01:36.755 --> 01:38.588
<i>And dying isn't a crime.</i>

01:38.590 --> 01:41.158
<i>But helping people die
makes you a criminal.</i>

01:41.160 --> 01:42.813
<i>You think so?</i>

01:44.963 --> 01:48.198
<i>I mean... yeah.</i>

01:52.304 --> 01:53.870
<i>Is there a long answer?</i>

01:53.872 --> 01:55.605
I should've come forward sooner.

01:55.607 --> 01:58.441
I know that now.

01:58.443 --> 02:02.045
I'd like to explain.

02:02.047 --> 02:04.514
I'm a doctor.
My patient was suffering.

02:04.516 --> 02:07.617
I couldn't just stand by
and do nothing.

02:14.026 --> 02:15.892
<i>God, you don't seem sick.</i>

02:20.732 --> 02:22.365
<i>I'm sorry.
I meant that as compliment.</i>

02:22.367 --> 02:25.335
I'm sorry.
I was acting on instinct.

02:40.451 --> 02:42.319
The last time I examined Sid,

02:42.321 --> 02:44.754
his anxiety
was through the roof,

02:44.756 --> 02:46.856
convinced whoever shot him
would finish the job,

02:46.858 --> 02:48.258
even with the cops there.

02:48.260 --> 02:51.595
So I thought if transferring
him to a room

02:51.597 --> 02:53.430
made him feel
more secure, then...

02:53.432 --> 02:56.499
Do you know
which porter transferred him?

02:56.501 --> 02:59.669
The one in the gray scrubs.

02:59.671 --> 03:00.770
You know how it is.

03:00.772 --> 03:04.774
I just grabbed
the first one I saw.

03:04.776 --> 03:06.376
I really just wanted
to help him.

03:06.378 --> 03:07.978
The disappearance
of Sid Thomas-Haye

03:07.980 --> 03:10.180
has caused a major
shit-storm around here.

03:10.182 --> 03:11.948
The cops are all over me.

03:11.950 --> 03:14.618
They still haven't found him?

03:14.620 --> 03:17.454
No, but hopefully
the security footage

03:17.456 --> 03:19.990
will get the cops off my back.

03:19.992 --> 03:21.491
Security footage?

03:21.493 --> 03:23.693
Yes, Dr. Taylor
saw an SUV speeding away

03:23.695 --> 03:25.095
from the hospital.

03:25.097 --> 03:27.697
Hopefully when they review
those street cams,

03:27.699 --> 03:29.332
they will find that car.

03:34.640 --> 03:38.108
Well, let me know if I can
do anything more to help.

03:38.110 --> 03:39.252
Will do.

04:08.906 --> 04:13.376
Dr. Harris and I have
an appointment today, 1:00.

04:14.612 --> 04:17.814
Okay, yeah.

04:17.815 --> 04:19.716
Yeah.

04:19.718 --> 04:21.483
Okay.

04:26.724 --> 04:29.125
<i>I'm just surprised
he took the deal, that's all.</i>

04:29.127 --> 04:30.660
Well, believe it or not,

04:30.662 --> 04:32.595
there are men who can
resist Mary's charms.

04:32.597 --> 04:34.631
I'm just saying that
he and Mary seem pretty tight.

04:34.633 --> 04:36.199
Yeah, well, you and I
are pretty tight,

04:36.201 --> 04:38.301
but I'd wear a wire on your ass
to avoid a murder rap.

04:38.303 --> 04:39.936
All right, what time
is this meeting?

04:39.938 --> 04:41.771
Desmond said 1:00,
and you know if we're late,

04:41.773 --> 04:43.139
someone's gonna die.

04:43.141 --> 04:44.207
Yeah.

05:01.193 --> 05:02.492
- Mary, Mary.
- This isn't a good time.

05:02.494 --> 05:03.560
No, no, I need your advice.

05:03.562 --> 05:04.828
I need your help.

05:04.830 --> 05:06.896
What?

05:06.898 --> 05:09.132
The Danvers woman
has asked me to pray.

05:09.134 --> 05:11.468
- Pray with her.
- I'm not gonna do that.

05:11.470 --> 05:14.838
I'm a man of medicine, Mary,
you know, science, reality.

05:14.840 --> 05:17.173
- So what's reality?
- Well, he's out of options.

05:17.175 --> 05:19.376
He's mechanically alive.

05:19.378 --> 05:20.844
What about more surgery?

05:20.846 --> 05:22.078
He's not strong enough for that.

05:22.080 --> 05:24.514
- Tell her that.
- You know what I think?

05:24.516 --> 05:26.082
There should be a rule.

05:26.084 --> 05:29.753
I know, against asking doctors
to pray in a hospital.

05:29.755 --> 05:31.388
Well, Dennis,
you have two options.

05:31.390 --> 05:33.456
You can grow some balls
and tell Sonia

05:33.458 --> 05:35.158
to pull the plug on her husband

05:35.160 --> 05:37.961
or you can get on your
goddamn knees and pray.

05:39.764 --> 05:41.264
- Mary, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

05:41.266 --> 05:42.332
I have to go.

05:45.137 --> 05:47.103
Here's a riddle.

05:47.105 --> 05:50.073
What has a gunshot wound,
wears a hospital gown,

05:50.075 --> 05:52.142
and can barely walk by himself?

05:52.144 --> 05:53.376
I don't know.

05:53.378 --> 05:55.111
Maybe Prentice and Hall
have seen him.

05:56.448 --> 05:58.415
- That's not even a riddle.
- You're right.

05:58.417 --> 05:59.849
It's a joke.

05:59.851 --> 06:02.185
Ignore them.

06:04.956 --> 06:06.156
Check this out.

06:06.158 --> 06:08.024
There's an SUV.

06:08.026 --> 06:10.260
It's a Yukon XL.

06:10.262 --> 06:11.995
Can't see anything.

06:11.997 --> 06:13.430
How do we know if it's Sid?

06:13.432 --> 06:15.999
We run the plates, get a name,
and start asking questions.

06:16.001 --> 06:18.268
God, you're so new.

06:32.483 --> 06:34.984
Sid Thomas-Haye.

06:34.986 --> 06:36.486
What about him?

06:36.488 --> 06:38.588
Ellen hauled me in her office
to ask me all sorts of questions

06:38.590 --> 06:42.125
since he was transferred
to my ward by you.

06:42.127 --> 06:43.526
- What did you tell her?
- The truth.

06:43.528 --> 06:45.328
You should try it sometime.

06:47.331 --> 06:50.266
Did you have anything to do
with that guy's disappearance?

06:53.437 --> 06:54.771
Yes.

06:54.773 --> 06:56.172
Annie, I'm so sorry.

06:56.174 --> 06:59.008
I didn't mean
to get you involved,

06:59.010 --> 07:01.911
but I've got it
all under control, I promise.

07:01.913 --> 07:03.947
You promised when we started
this that everything

07:03.949 --> 07:05.782
was going to be fine.

07:05.784 --> 07:08.384
It is so not fine.

07:08.386 --> 07:10.587
You are being followed
by the police,

07:10.589 --> 07:12.922
and now you're helping somebody
escape police custody.

07:12.924 --> 07:14.524
I don't even know
what this has become.

07:14.526 --> 07:17.527
- You don't understand.
- I didn't have a choice.

07:17.529 --> 07:19.229
Well, I do.

07:19.231 --> 07:20.430
I quit.

07:20.432 --> 07:23.066
- Annie, wait.
- No.

07:23.068 --> 07:25.468
We are going to get caught.

07:25.470 --> 07:27.770
And I cannot get caught.

07:40.452 --> 07:42.619
My clothes were strangling me.

07:57.101 --> 08:00.169
Is "Ben" short for something?

08:00.171 --> 08:03.873
Benjamin. Benedict.

08:03.875 --> 08:05.041
Benvolio.

08:09.713 --> 08:11.414
You mind telling me why
your pupils are so pinned?

08:11.416 --> 08:14.918
It's because
my future's so bright.

08:14.920 --> 08:17.453
What do you want?

08:17.455 --> 08:19.130
She likes you, you know.

08:21.226 --> 08:22.692
You really think getting high

08:22.694 --> 08:24.694
is gonna make this any easier?

08:24.696 --> 08:26.329
The first person she's been with

08:26.331 --> 08:28.264
since her marriage ended.

08:30.701 --> 08:32.368
Really?

08:32.370 --> 08:34.331
How are you going
to live with yourself?

08:36.274 --> 08:38.341
I'm thinking
I'll inject narcotics

08:38.342 --> 08:41.277
into my veins on the regular.

08:41.279 --> 08:42.912
What's your plan, Benvolio?

08:42.914 --> 08:47.317
My plan, my plan, Desmond,
is, I am just doing my job.

08:47.319 --> 08:48.585
Throw yourself into the work.

08:48.587 --> 08:51.421
That's a good, solid plan.

08:51.423 --> 08:53.756
But it's the same thing, really.

08:53.758 --> 08:56.459
The drugs, the law...

08:56.461 --> 08:59.295
it's all just an attempt
to control the chaos.

08:59.297 --> 09:02.332
You ever think Mary's the one
that creates the chaos?

09:02.334 --> 09:03.900
Yeah, she's good at that.

09:03.902 --> 09:10.974
But if you know her, then you
know that it's worth it, right?

09:10.976 --> 09:13.350
The thing is, I don't know her.

09:14.679 --> 09:18.114
What I do know is that
she's out of control,

09:18.116 --> 09:20.483
and this is the only
way she'll stop.

09:24.054 --> 09:26.522
This is gonna break her heart.

09:32.329 --> 09:34.430
Say something.

09:36.500 --> 09:40.103
Hail Mary,

09:40.105 --> 09:42.405
full of grace...

09:53.351 --> 09:55.985
Sing along with me, Benvolio.

11:05.185 --> 11:07.185
My...

11:07.187 --> 11:08.853
My...

11:13.926 --> 11:16.728
- It can't be.
- Hi, Mama.

11:19.699 --> 11:22.600
Um, you're kind of hurting me.

11:22.602 --> 11:24.002
Hey.

11:24.004 --> 11:25.937
What are you doing here?

11:25.939 --> 11:28.306
I lost my math book.

11:30.786 --> 11:33.239
Can you go check
under your bed, please.

11:34.580 --> 11:36.948
Kevin, what the hell?

11:37.591 --> 11:39.832
How many times have I told you

11:39.911 --> 11:42.512
you can't just come in here
whenever you feel like it?

11:42.514 --> 11:44.014
Cambie needed her math book...

11:44.016 --> 11:46.816
This is not your house anymore.

11:46.818 --> 11:48.351
I should be able to come home

11:48.353 --> 11:51.154
and not worry if someone's
gonna be here or not.

11:51.156 --> 11:53.098
Okay, fine.

11:53.161 --> 11:56.696
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, come here.

11:56.697 --> 11:58.997
It's okay, come here, come here.

11:58.999 --> 12:01.800
It's okay.

12:01.802 --> 12:03.802
It's okay.

12:03.804 --> 12:07.373
It's okay. I got it.

12:07.375 --> 12:09.508
Shh, Mary.

12:10.877 --> 12:12.778
Mary, Mary.

12:16.716 --> 12:19.351
- I'm sorry.
- You should take your key back.

12:23.690 --> 12:25.758
- Found it. Bye, Mama.
- Good.

12:25.760 --> 12:26.959
Wait, wait.

12:29.429 --> 12:31.597
Okay, okay, Mom.

12:35.201 --> 12:37.169
Little face, I love you.

12:42.342 --> 12:45.544
Mary, hey.

12:45.546 --> 12:47.946
You really need
to get some rest.

12:47.948 --> 12:49.615
All right?

13:01.361 --> 13:04.963
I'm sorry about what
I said the other day.

13:04.965 --> 13:06.565
It's fine.

13:06.567 --> 13:10.402
<i>I just lost it on Kevin, too.</i>

13:10.404 --> 13:11.664
<i>Why?</i>

13:13.040 --> 13:15.207
<i>I don't know.
I guess it's all getting to me.</i>

13:16.342 --> 13:17.743
You know what's weird too?

13:17.745 --> 13:21.180
I keep thinking about Ben,
like, wanting to talk to him.

13:21.182 --> 13:24.616
- Ben the cop.
- Yeah, Ben the cop.

13:26.586 --> 13:28.620
<i>And it's crazy
given the circumstances,</i>

13:28.622 --> 13:30.422
<i>but I really...</i>

13:30.424 --> 13:33.992
thought there was
something there,

13:33.994 --> 13:35.894
but maybe it was
just the great sex.

13:35.896 --> 13:37.563
It wasn't that great.

13:37.565 --> 13:39.198
Saw it.

13:39.200 --> 13:41.066
What, it was like 30 seconds?

13:41.068 --> 13:43.469
It's impossible. I mean...

13:43.471 --> 13:45.737
Yeah, it's impossible.

13:45.739 --> 13:48.907
Yeah, it's impossible because
you're going to jail, Mary.

13:48.909 --> 13:50.509
<i>You can't move forward, right?</i>

13:50.511 --> 13:54.046
You can't get anywhere
without trust.

13:54.048 --> 13:56.882
Trust no one, that's what I say.

13:59.352 --> 14:00.953
What's wrong with you?

14:00.955 --> 14:02.754
Nothing, I'm fine. I'm good.

14:05.758 --> 14:07.559
You're high, God.

14:07.561 --> 14:09.461
<i>- Mary...
- Shit.</i>

14:09.463 --> 14:10.929
I told you she'd notice.
She's a doctor.

14:10.931 --> 14:13.031
Don't lie to me, asshole.
You're high.

14:13.033 --> 14:14.299
Lie to her, asshole.

14:14.301 --> 14:16.535
Fine, fine, I slipped up, okay?

14:16.537 --> 14:18.804
Not okay. When did this happen?

14:20.273 --> 14:22.508
Today. I'm...

14:22.510 --> 14:23.775
I'm an idiot. I'm sorry.

14:23.777 --> 14:25.477
Why? What triggered it?

14:25.479 --> 14:26.979
I'm an addict.

14:26.981 --> 14:31.049
I don't need a trigger.
Everything's a... a trigger.

14:31.051 --> 14:32.451
Is it because of what I said?

14:32.453 --> 14:34.520
Jesus, Des, I didn't mean
to blame you.

14:34.522 --> 14:36.321
I was just scared. I...

14:36.323 --> 14:38.457
It's not your fault.

14:38.459 --> 14:40.392
- She's gonna call it off.
- No, she loves it too much.

14:40.394 --> 14:43.495
She's not calling it off
and neither are we.

14:43.497 --> 14:44.930
Hey, it's a disease.

14:44.932 --> 14:47.099
It's a process.

14:47.101 --> 14:48.567
Slips are part of recovery.

14:48.569 --> 14:50.502
That's what they say, right?

14:54.140 --> 14:55.641
Des, I need you.

14:55.643 --> 14:57.543
You're the only person
in my corner right now.

14:57.545 --> 15:00.145
If you lose it, I'll lose it.

15:02.215 --> 15:05.117
After Morgan,
we'll figure this out.

15:12.493 --> 15:15.360
Hi, Des. Mary, right?

15:15.362 --> 15:17.529
- Hi, Morgan.
- Hi, come on in.

15:19.333 --> 15:21.133
Do you have visitors, or...

15:21.135 --> 15:24.703
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
- They... they just showed up.

15:24.705 --> 15:27.105
Guys, time to pack it up.

15:33.313 --> 15:35.080
This is the band.

15:35.082 --> 15:36.882
Meet Medieval Carnage.

15:36.884 --> 15:38.350
- Hey there.
- Hi.

15:38.352 --> 15:40.986
- They make me look good.
- You make us look good, man.

15:40.988 --> 15:42.521
Have you seen him shred?

15:42.523 --> 15:43.889
<i>Guy's a genius.</i>

15:43.891 --> 15:45.157
<i>I'm his drummer, Pete.</i>

15:45.159 --> 15:46.692
<i>- Hi.
- What's wrong with this guy?</i>

15:46.694 --> 15:49.461
He invites his banger friends
the day he's supposed to die?

15:49.463 --> 15:51.296
You guys friends of Morgan's?

15:51.298 --> 15:52.531
We're counselors.

15:52.533 --> 15:54.566
Kind of like palliative care.

15:54.568 --> 15:56.368
We can come back
if you guys need to...

15:56.370 --> 15:57.536
Need to shred or whatever.

15:57.538 --> 15:59.071
<i>No, no, no, let's roll.</i>

16:00.306 --> 16:02.140
I'm glad you decided
to get counseling.

16:02.142 --> 16:03.208
It'll be good for you.

16:03.210 --> 16:05.877
Yeah, thanks
for dropping by, guys.

16:07.413 --> 16:08.714
You're gonna be fine, brother.

16:08.716 --> 16:10.482
Yeah, mate, so are you.

16:12.218 --> 16:13.719
Get him out of here.

16:19.960 --> 16:20.959
I am so sorry.

16:20.961 --> 16:22.828
- Morgan, do they know?
- No.

16:22.830 --> 16:25.097
It's just...
It's been hard on them too,

16:25.099 --> 16:28.800
you know, watching me die,
and they sometimes stop in

16:28.802 --> 16:30.235
and just check and see
if I'm breathing.

16:30.237 --> 16:31.436
I still think that we should go.

16:31.438 --> 16:35.007
No, no, please, please,
I need your help.

16:35.009 --> 16:36.308
I'm begging you.

16:38.678 --> 16:41.613
Des, it's okay.

16:41.615 --> 16:43.315
It's okay. Look at me.

16:44.584 --> 16:47.119
It's okay.

17:06.472 --> 17:09.207
How are you feeling?

17:09.209 --> 17:11.576
Good.

17:11.578 --> 17:13.011
Weird.

17:13.012 --> 17:16.915
Feel like I'm standing
at the edge of a cliff.

17:16.916 --> 17:18.583
Does that make any sense?

17:18.585 --> 17:21.118
It makes a lot of sense.

17:21.121 --> 17:23.888
We have a few things to go over,

17:23.891 --> 17:25.824
and I have something
for you to sign.

17:27.327 --> 17:29.361
Des, the contract?

17:33.333 --> 17:35.133
Des?

18:24.217 --> 18:28.120
These friends of yours...

18:28.122 --> 18:30.522
have you known them
for a long time?

18:34.227 --> 18:35.961
20 years.

18:35.963 --> 18:38.430
We went to high school together.

18:38.432 --> 18:40.899
<i>Misfits and losers, you know.</i>

18:40.901 --> 18:45.203
I guess we banded
together... literally.

18:47.907 --> 18:51.343
That's great.

18:51.345 --> 18:56.048
Such an important part
of life, isn't it?

18:57.517 --> 18:59.985
To have friends
you can count on.

18:59.987 --> 19:02.254
Mary...

19:05.893 --> 19:09.094
<i>Friends can be such a comfort
in a time of suffering.</i>

19:09.096 --> 19:10.662
What's she gonna do,
talk this guy to death?

19:10.664 --> 19:12.598
I don't know.

19:24.110 --> 19:26.578
We hope that we can be as well.

19:28.448 --> 19:33.185
And we would be happy to provide
more counseling sessions

19:33.187 --> 19:34.753
<i>whenever you need them.</i>

19:34.755 --> 19:36.555
That's her cover story.

19:38.324 --> 19:39.691
Where is she going with this?

19:48.568 --> 19:51.136
That sounds great, um,

19:51.138 --> 19:53.905
<i>but right now,
I'm kind of tired.</i>

19:53.907 --> 19:57.376
Cystic Fibrosis flare-up.

19:57.378 --> 19:58.977
It happens.

20:16.262 --> 20:18.263
We can reschedule
your counseling session

20:18.265 --> 20:20.532
for another time.

20:21.834 --> 20:24.002
You should rest now.

20:29.009 --> 20:30.976
<i>Wait, wait, wait, wait.</i>

20:32.178 --> 20:34.079
- Please, wait.
- You know what, Des?

20:34.081 --> 20:35.981
I think it's really
unprofessional of you

20:35.983 --> 20:37.816
to come
to a counseling session high.

20:39.186 --> 20:41.086
The wire, he's taking
off the wire.

20:41.088 --> 20:42.688
Frank!

20:42.690 --> 20:44.589
So maybe you should
just walk home

20:44.591 --> 20:46.091
and think about
what you've done.

20:46.093 --> 20:47.626
I'm a bastard, okay?

20:47.628 --> 20:49.327
I'm a bastard. Don't go.

20:50.697 --> 20:51.763
Don't go.

20:53.033 --> 20:54.033
Please.

20:59.305 --> 21:00.672
- You piece of shit.
- Frank!

21:00.674 --> 21:01.707
Frank, take it easy.

21:01.709 --> 21:02.708
Come on, man. Come on.

21:02.710 --> 21:03.809
- Off, off!
- Get off!

21:03.811 --> 21:05.711
Back off! Off!

21:05.713 --> 21:07.479
- She made me!
- Of course she didn't make you!

21:07.481 --> 21:09.448
You're going down for this.

21:09.450 --> 21:12.984
Fine, you can go ahead,
and you read me my rights?

21:15.021 --> 21:16.388
- Well?
- Come on.

21:16.390 --> 21:18.190
Get the hell out of my sight.

21:18.192 --> 21:19.558
You can't arrest me.

21:19.560 --> 21:21.960
- Get out of my goddamn sight.
- With pleasure.

21:27.533 --> 21:30.569
Do you realize...
do you realize how bad this is?

21:30.571 --> 21:31.737
Come on,

21:31.739 --> 21:32.771
I told you he was high,
all right?

21:32.773 --> 21:34.239
- You pushed it.
- I pushed it?

21:34.241 --> 21:36.174
No, no, no, you don't get
to put this one me, all right?

21:36.176 --> 21:37.676
You compromised this case
from day one.

21:37.678 --> 21:41.179
- That right?
- Remember that?

21:41.181 --> 21:42.786
You know what?

21:44.485 --> 21:45.951
You can do the debriefing
with Grant.

21:45.953 --> 21:47.252
Tell him whatever
the hell you want.

21:47.254 --> 21:48.286
- I'm done.
- Frank...

21:48.288 --> 21:50.021
- No, I'm done.
- Frank, come on.

21:50.023 --> 21:52.057
I'm done.

21:58.664 --> 21:59.998
Jess.

22:02.335 --> 22:03.902
Hey, want to skip today?

22:03.904 --> 22:05.203
No.

22:05.205 --> 22:07.205
- We can go to the mall.
- I have money today for real.

22:07.207 --> 22:08.440
That's cool. Have fun.

22:10.309 --> 22:11.910
What?

22:11.912 --> 22:13.278
Why are you bailing on me?

22:13.280 --> 22:16.748
- Because you're a psychopath.
- Jess.

22:16.750 --> 22:18.650
Jess, I need you.

22:20.653 --> 22:22.053
I love you.

22:22.055 --> 22:24.790
No, you don't.

22:24.792 --> 22:27.225
Okay.

22:27.227 --> 22:29.661
Is that what this is about?

22:29.663 --> 22:31.229
You mad I'm not a dyke?

22:31.231 --> 22:32.998
Whoa.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.833
I'm sorry.
What are you, embarrassed?

22:34.835 --> 22:36.635
Well, you should be.

22:36.637 --> 22:40.272
I thought we were
just having some fun.

22:40.274 --> 22:46.111
I can't believe you're ruining
our friendship over this.

22:46.113 --> 22:48.413
We could have been
like sisters, Jess,

22:48.415 --> 22:50.949
and now you're turning
into this selfish bitch.

22:50.951 --> 22:52.083
I'm a self...

22:52.085 --> 22:54.619
No, you are the most selfish
person in the world.

22:54.621 --> 22:57.155
I could search the whole planet,
and I wouldn't find

22:57.157 --> 22:58.657
a more self-absorbed
person than...

23:11.839 --> 23:15.340
So, transfer her upstairs,
and if she's in a lot of pain,

23:15.342 --> 23:19.778
give her 50 milligrams
of morphine.

23:19.780 --> 23:21.112
50?

23:21.114 --> 23:23.481
We want to ease her pain,
not put her in a coma.

23:23.483 --> 23:25.350
- Did I say...?
- Five.

23:26.485 --> 23:28.920
Hey, are you okay?

23:28.922 --> 23:31.523
Yeah, I'm...

23:31.525 --> 23:32.958
It's been a long day.

23:32.960 --> 23:35.594
Hey, I've got something
that'll cheer you up.

23:35.596 --> 23:37.529
Did you hear about Matt Danvers?

23:43.003 --> 23:45.937
He woke up about an hour ago.

23:45.939 --> 23:48.773
We've been praying and praying,
even Dr. Taylor.

23:48.775 --> 23:51.076
It turns out I have a knack.

23:52.846 --> 23:54.946
I could see you waiting for me.

23:54.948 --> 23:58.183
I never lost faith.

23:58.185 --> 24:01.620
Wow, that's...

24:01.622 --> 24:04.656
That's amazing.

24:04.658 --> 24:06.391
And, Matt, you feel okay?

24:06.393 --> 24:10.095
It's all good.
It's a miracle, Mary.

24:10.097 --> 24:13.732
Well, Sonia, Matt,
I'm so happy for both of you.

24:13.734 --> 24:14.766
This is...

24:16.203 --> 24:18.503
Great, great news.

24:18.505 --> 24:20.105
Excuse me.

24:22.276 --> 24:23.508
Hello?

24:23.510 --> 24:24.976
<i>Hello, Dr. Harris?</i>

24:24.978 --> 24:27.445
<i>This is principal Amelia Foster
from Westbridge Academy.</i>

24:27.447 --> 24:28.647
Is everything okay?

24:28.649 --> 24:30.315
<i>It's about
your daughter Jessica.</i>

24:30.317 --> 24:32.550
<i>You need to come
to the school immediately.</i>

24:32.552 --> 24:33.818
<i>We have a situation.</i>

24:36.322 --> 24:39.224
- My God, is that...
- What happened?

24:39.226 --> 24:41.159
Jess attacked Naomi.

24:41.161 --> 24:42.227
Is that true?

24:42.229 --> 24:43.962
- No, she hit me first.
- No, I didn't.

24:43.964 --> 24:45.463
- Why are you fighting?
- What's going on?

24:45.465 --> 24:46.531
They won't say.

24:46.533 --> 24:47.866
The most I could get out of them

24:47.868 --> 24:51.736
is that they were arguing
and then it got physical.

24:51.738 --> 24:55.106
Either way, we have
a zero-tolerance policy

24:55.108 --> 24:56.374
for violence at Westbridge.

24:56.376 --> 24:57.776
There will be consequences.

24:57.778 --> 24:59.477
Well, I don't think
that Naomi should be punished.

24:59.479 --> 25:00.712
She didn't instigate anything.

25:00.714 --> 25:01.947
Well, Jess said she did.

25:01.949 --> 25:04.182
- Well, it's hearsay.
- Are we in court?

25:04.184 --> 25:05.884
What is this? Come on.

25:05.886 --> 25:08.520
How about I talk?

25:08.522 --> 25:11.056
Given your daughter's
excellent records,

25:11.058 --> 25:12.624
I won't suspend them,

25:12.626 --> 25:17.195
but there will be detention,
after school for two weeks.

25:17.197 --> 25:18.430
That seems fair.

25:20.766 --> 25:23.401
Of course.

25:23.403 --> 25:25.904
Okay, Naomi, let's go.

25:33.779 --> 25:35.847
Jess, wait, I wanna talk to you.

25:35.849 --> 25:37.182
Just leave me alone.

25:37.184 --> 25:40.151
- Hey, slow down and look at me.
- Don't you get it?

25:40.153 --> 25:42.220
I don't want to talk to you.
I don't want to look at you.

25:42.222 --> 25:44.289
I don't... I don't want
anything to do with you.

25:44.291 --> 25:46.091
Why are you here?

25:46.093 --> 25:49.294
Because I want to help you,
because I love you.

25:49.296 --> 25:52.163
I'm so sick of people
talking about love

25:52.165 --> 25:53.865
when they have no idea
what it means.

25:53.867 --> 25:57.736
You know, if you love somebody,
you don't lie to them.

25:57.738 --> 26:00.538
You don't tell them
you care about them

26:00.540 --> 26:02.374
when all you care
about is yourself.

26:02.376 --> 26:05.543
- Jess.
- No, just go.

26:05.545 --> 26:06.945
It's all you ever do anyways,

26:06.947 --> 26:10.482
and you know,
it used to make me really sad,

26:10.484 --> 26:13.385
but I don't really care anymore,

26:13.387 --> 26:16.421
because when you're around,
everything really sucks.

26:18.791 --> 26:22.293
Hey, hey, hey, Jess.

26:24.230 --> 26:26.351
What the hell is happening
between you two?

26:27.801 --> 26:28.804
She hates me.

26:32.905 --> 26:37.008
Look, I know you've been
under a lot of stress lately,

26:37.010 --> 26:38.810
and the financial pressure
I've put you under

26:38.812 --> 26:41.312
hasn't helped. I know that.

26:41.314 --> 26:43.548
That's all gonna change.

26:43.550 --> 26:46.151
The house just sold
a couple hours ago,

26:46.153 --> 26:48.319
well over asking.

26:48.321 --> 26:49.954
So, I'll be able
to pay you back.

26:49.956 --> 26:53.591
You can pull back on your hours,
spend more time with the girls.

26:55.361 --> 26:57.195
Where are you gonna live?

26:59.832 --> 27:02.333
I'm moving in with Louise.

27:02.335 --> 27:03.334
What?

27:03.336 --> 27:05.703
I love her, and she loves me.

27:05.705 --> 27:07.172
Sometimes it can be that simple.

27:07.174 --> 27:09.274
I think it's too fast.

27:12.712 --> 27:14.679
Well, you know what?

27:14.681 --> 27:18.216
I never thought
I'd get here, but I did.

27:18.218 --> 27:21.219
Where? Get where?

27:21.221 --> 27:24.322
To a place where it doesn't
really matter what you think.

27:38.533 --> 27:40.835
Another setback.

27:40.838 --> 27:43.205
I understand
your frustration, sir.

27:45.174 --> 27:47.843
I mean, I've been on cases
that have taken months,

27:47.845 --> 27:49.344
if not years, so.

27:49.346 --> 27:51.012
And you've been given
every opportunity

27:51.014 --> 27:52.814
and every resource
for this case.

27:52.816 --> 27:54.082
I don't understand
what the problem is.

27:54.084 --> 27:55.617
I want answers about my son.

27:55.619 --> 27:57.352
Well, we are making progress.

27:57.354 --> 27:59.454
We have identified
another potential victim.

27:59.456 --> 28:00.622
The hospital records confirm

28:00.624 --> 28:03.658
that Annie Chung was
indeed his nurse.

28:03.660 --> 28:07.562
However, the wife is a little
hesitant to cooperate

28:07.564 --> 28:09.264
with the investigation.

28:11.834 --> 28:13.668
We are close, sir.
We're very close.

28:13.670 --> 28:15.070
We just need a little more time.

28:34.057 --> 28:36.391
Are you sure
you're alone this time?

28:36.393 --> 28:37.592
I'm sure.

28:48.872 --> 28:53.241
Not a bad way to go?

28:53.243 --> 28:58.713
Clean sheets, nice view,
free hair products.

29:02.085 --> 29:05.453
I always pictured drowning
in my own mucus in the ICU.

29:05.455 --> 29:07.322
This is better.

29:11.728 --> 29:15.263
You're quiet.
Is something wrong?

29:15.265 --> 29:17.899
Do you think the room is bugged?

29:17.901 --> 29:21.369
I'll need you to sign
this contract...

29:21.371 --> 29:23.138
- Okay.
- And do the statement

29:23.140 --> 29:24.372
on camera.

29:24.374 --> 29:25.907
Of course.

29:25.909 --> 29:27.842
Um...

29:35.519 --> 29:38.019
Do you find this hard?

29:38.021 --> 29:40.674
Bringing death to the decrepit
and vulnerable?

29:41.892 --> 29:44.050
I didn't before.

29:44.861 --> 29:48.964
What was hard was
watching people suffer.

29:48.966 --> 29:51.399
Nothing worse
than an undignified death.

29:51.401 --> 29:53.791
I guess the cops don't agree.

29:55.472 --> 29:58.206
What are you going to do?

29:58.208 --> 29:59.674
Come on.

29:59.676 --> 30:03.678
Safe to say I won't be
telling anyone your secrets.

30:03.680 --> 30:05.900
This is supposed
to be about you.

30:08.051 --> 30:12.520
Honestly, you look like
you're in more pain than I am.

30:20.864 --> 30:26.501
I just... can't see
any way out of this.

30:26.503 --> 30:31.239
I mean, any way that doesn't
mean ending up in jail.

30:33.777 --> 30:36.811
But I don't know.
Maybe that's what I deserve.

30:40.817 --> 30:42.884
There you are. Where were you?

30:42.886 --> 30:44.552
How did you get in?

30:44.554 --> 30:46.288
- You gave me a key.
- You need to leave.

30:46.290 --> 30:48.189
- I can't be around anyone.
- What's wrong?

30:48.191 --> 30:49.291
What's wrong with you, Larissa?

30:49.293 --> 30:50.592
You can't do better than me?

30:50.594 --> 30:53.328
- Stop it, Des.
- You need a daddy.

30:53.330 --> 30:55.797
I'm not your daddy.

30:55.799 --> 30:57.766
I don't need a daddy, asshole.

30:57.768 --> 30:59.768
Just take your things,
all your little things,

30:59.770 --> 31:02.237
and get out!

31:02.239 --> 31:04.205
You're a jerk!

31:06.208 --> 31:07.242
I know.

32:14.044 --> 32:16.644
When I was younger,
I developed this obsession

32:16.646 --> 32:20.582
with medieval torture,
like the Judas cradle.

32:20.584 --> 32:21.883
Did you ever hear of that?

32:21.885 --> 32:23.918
No.

32:23.920 --> 32:26.921
They sit you on this triangular

32:26.923 --> 32:31.626
metal point,
and you slowly become impaled,

32:31.628 --> 32:33.461
or they strap
you to the iron chair

32:33.463 --> 32:37.332
with hundreds
of tiny little spikes,

32:37.334 --> 32:39.834
or they tie you up
in the town square,

32:39.836 --> 32:43.705
and you die
the slowest death imaginable

32:43.707 --> 32:46.174
on display for the whole town.

32:46.176 --> 32:49.177
Nice.

32:49.179 --> 32:52.147
Why are you telling me this?

32:52.149 --> 32:57.252
Because in 100 years,
they'll look back at now

32:57.254 --> 32:59.654
and say that the most
popular form of torture

32:59.656 --> 33:04.325
was refusing to let people die.

33:04.327 --> 33:06.694
Dragging it out.

33:06.696 --> 33:10.565
Give people false hope,
false relief,

33:10.567 --> 33:13.301
hook them up to machines.

33:13.303 --> 33:15.236
Something that should
take months

33:15.238 --> 33:17.689
to kill them would take years.

33:20.143 --> 33:23.978
Those people?
They're the bad guys.

33:23.980 --> 33:25.409
But you?

33:28.084 --> 33:29.553
You're one of the good ones.

33:31.721 --> 33:33.791
Do you really think so?

33:35.792 --> 33:37.228
Yeah.

33:53.843 --> 33:55.109
Wow.

34:01.183 --> 34:03.651
Are you going to stay with me?

34:03.653 --> 34:05.453
Yes, of course I will.

34:13.262 --> 34:15.763
Can you talk to me?

34:27.610 --> 34:31.946
You know, the first time
I did this, I was 16.

34:31.947 --> 34:33.330
It was with my mother.

34:35.418 --> 34:36.790
She was sick?

34:38.154 --> 34:40.127
Yeah, she was depressed.

34:42.425 --> 34:45.096
She wanted to die
more than anything.

34:47.163 --> 34:51.900
So each day I'd come from school
not knowing what I'd find.

34:51.902 --> 34:53.701
And my mother was good
at a lot of things,

34:53.703 --> 34:56.103
but she was terrible at suicide.

35:02.978 --> 35:05.179
Maybe there was something
holding her back.

35:05.181 --> 35:07.682
I don't know.

35:17.293 --> 35:19.561
At first, I...

35:19.563 --> 35:22.545
I tried to talk her out of it.

35:23.800 --> 35:25.133
So many times.

35:27.336 --> 35:30.471
But after a while, I realized
that was never gonna work.

35:30.473 --> 35:35.109
Forcing her to stay alive
wasn't the way to save her.

35:39.548 --> 35:41.849
So I helped.

35:45.254 --> 35:48.903
She said she might
pull a Houdini,

35:50.594 --> 35:53.094
but I knew she wouldn't.

35:57.099 --> 35:59.629
I remember...

36:00.770 --> 36:02.971
the relief.

36:04.640 --> 36:09.243
No more waiting,
no more wondering.

36:11.113 --> 36:14.716
And for a moment...

36:14.718 --> 36:16.951
everything was calm.

38:17.940 --> 38:20.808
I was just thinking about you.

38:20.810 --> 38:22.410
<i>Help.</i>

38:22.412 --> 38:24.312
- What?
- Des?

38:28.284 --> 38:29.484
<i>Des?</i>

38:31.221 --> 38:32.553
Des, talk to me. Are you okay?

38:32.555 --> 38:35.556
What's going on?

38:35.558 --> 38:37.061
<i>Des?</i>

38:50.221 --> 38:51.353
My God.

39:08.371 --> 39:11.674
Come on, come on.

39:11.676 --> 39:13.642
Come on.

39:13.644 --> 39:16.278
Wake up.

39:19.550 --> 39:21.917
Stop. Stop it.

39:21.919 --> 39:23.552
- You stop it.
- Stop it.

39:23.554 --> 39:24.653
You don't get to do this.

39:24.655 --> 39:26.388
You don't get to call me
crying for help,

39:26.390 --> 39:28.090
not after what you said.

39:28.092 --> 39:32.461
I know, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

39:41.037 --> 39:42.738
Tell me why.

39:45.942 --> 39:47.543
We had a fight.

39:47.545 --> 39:50.279
You weren't returning my calls.

39:50.281 --> 39:52.081
And that detective,
he said you were with Ben,

39:52.083 --> 39:53.415
and I got scared.

39:53.417 --> 39:56.018
You thought I would have
turned on you?

39:56.020 --> 39:57.953
Well, maybe you should have.

39:58.408 --> 40:00.275
Let's face it, Mary.
I'm a liability.

40:00.277 --> 40:02.577
One way or another I ruin
every good thing in my life.

40:02.579 --> 40:04.479
Stop trying to make me
feel sorry for you.

40:04.481 --> 40:06.681
It's not gonna work.

40:06.683 --> 40:08.750
We're done, Des.

40:10.720 --> 40:12.654
It's over.

40:14.657 --> 40:18.159
I need a partner
who can handle this.

40:18.161 --> 40:19.995
I can.

40:21.931 --> 40:26.267
I only started using again
because I felt so guilty.

40:29.138 --> 40:30.573
I'm done now.

40:32.209 --> 40:33.511
I promise.

40:35.212 --> 40:37.479
Des, I can't trust you anymore.

40:42.485 --> 40:44.886
I guess that's it then.

40:46.822 --> 40:49.290
I'll find a job
washing cars or something.

40:53.295 --> 40:55.563
Think you'd be my reference?

41:15.584 --> 41:17.786
It's a peace offering.

41:20.089 --> 41:21.656
I managed to pull
a few strings, man.

41:21.658 --> 41:23.792
We got a search warrant
for Troy Dixon's property

41:23.794 --> 41:26.494
plus a production order
for all of his financials.

41:26.496 --> 41:30.065
Yeah, how'd you convince him?

41:30.067 --> 41:31.299
Well, you know,

41:31.301 --> 41:35.394
I just flashed these
old puppy dog eyes on him.

41:40.142 --> 41:42.544
So, we're good?

41:42.546 --> 41:45.046
We're good.

42:31.762 --> 42:32.894
Did the owner check it out?

42:32.896 --> 42:35.396
No, said the Yukon
showed up overnight.

42:35.398 --> 42:37.098
Figured it was hot,
called it in.

42:37.100 --> 42:40.468
- Lucky us.
- Maybe Sid's hiding out here.

42:40.470 --> 42:42.804
Living in a scrap yard?

42:42.806 --> 42:44.572
Maybe he ditched it and ran.

42:44.574 --> 42:47.242
There you go.

42:49.146 --> 42:51.279
God.

42:51.281 --> 42:54.449
- Jesus.
- Poor Sid.

42:54.451 --> 42:56.484
- Call it in.
- I'll check the vehicle.

42:56.486 --> 42:58.086
Yeah.

42:58.088 --> 43:00.655
Thanks for that.

43:00.657 --> 43:02.423
- This is Officer Hall.
- Need forensics

43:02.425 --> 43:04.959
at the scrap yard on West 15th.

43:04.961 --> 43:07.362
Got a 187.

43:07.364 --> 43:10.131
Look what I found.

43:15.839 --> 43:19.407
Well, look who it is,
the angel of death.

43:19.409 --> 43:20.875
I'm here to talk business.

43:20.877 --> 43:23.300
Are you ready to give me my cut?

43:24.981 --> 43:27.081
I need a new partner.

43:27.083 --> 43:28.783
50-50.

43:32.347 --> 43:35.516
The two hour finale event of Mary
Kills People, continues now.

43:37.019 --> 43:38.713
The only crime that Mary is
guilty of

43:38.738 --> 43:40.304
is trying to protect me.

43:40.306 --> 43:41.339
Save me.

43:41.341 --> 43:42.340
She can't help herself.

43:42.342 --> 43:43.342
It's what she does.

43:45.246 --> 43:47.312
We're not the same you and I.

43:47.314 --> 43:49.248
You create pain.

43:56.924 --> 43:59.091
Help me please. He drugged me.

43:59.093 --> 44:00.659
He's going to kill me.

44:00.661 --> 44:01.460
Where are you?

44:01.462 --> 44:02.462
Mary?
