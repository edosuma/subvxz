00:01.608 --> 00:03.743
Over 68 million Americans

00:03.745 --> 00:06.662
leave the safety of our
borders every year.

00:06.664 --> 00:07.997
If danger strikes,

00:07.999 --> 00:10.450
the FBI's international response team

00:10.452 --> 00:12.919
is called into action.

00:29.087 --> 00:30.770
Business. It's about fun.

00:30.772 --> 00:32.354
- I know.
- It's about, you know...

00:32.357 --> 00:33.973
Well, you know what? Let's do this.

00:33.975 --> 00:35.892
- Let's just... let's go.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:35.894 --> 00:37.810
We're not at some strip mall back home.

00:37.812 --> 00:39.278
What's your point?

00:39.280 --> 00:41.280
We're at the epicenter of sushi.

00:41.282 --> 00:42.565
Take it all in.

00:42.567 --> 00:44.450
Stop, savor the moment.

00:44.452 --> 00:46.202
I got it.

00:46.204 --> 00:49.572
So what's on the menu, O wise one?

00:49.574 --> 00:52.542
This is oyster on the half shell...

00:52.544 --> 00:54.410
- Mm-hmm.
- Quail egg yolk...

00:54.412 --> 00:57.163
Smelt roe, chopped green onion,

00:57.165 --> 00:59.165
- and a dash of mirin.
- Oh!

00:59.167 --> 01:01.000
It looks so pretty, I almost
don't want to eat it.

01:01.002 --> 01:02.301
I did say "almost."

01:02.303 --> 01:03.503
- Good.
- Cheers?

01:03.505 --> 01:06.255
- Cheers.
- Down the hatch.

01:06.257 --> 01:08.724
Mm! Mm!

01:08.726 --> 01:11.010
That is the freshest oyster
I've ever had in my life.

01:11.012 --> 01:13.229
- Truly amazing.
- No doubt.

01:13.231 --> 01:17.016
And that is why you deserve a toast.

01:18.186 --> 01:21.404
To my big brother, my best friend,

01:21.406 --> 01:22.989
and my business partner.

01:22.991 --> 01:25.191
Future's so bright, it hurts my eyes.

01:25.193 --> 01:26.742
Ha!

01:30.198 --> 01:32.031
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

01:32.033 --> 01:33.616
- No.
- You sure?

01:33.618 --> 01:34.700
No, no.

01:34.702 --> 01:36.953
That just means more for me, bro.

01:36.955 --> 01:38.337
All right. Get out of here.

01:38.339 --> 01:39.672
I'm going.

01:39.674 --> 01:41.841
We have stuff to do
tomorrow, so not too late.

01:41.843 --> 01:43.509
Okay, Mom.

01:43.511 --> 01:45.711
Have fun.

02:07.652 --> 02:10.620
Come on, Clara.

02:10.622 --> 02:12.822
Don't stand me up again.

02:24.719 --> 02:28.671
All work and no play makes
Mae a dull, dull girl.

02:28.673 --> 02:31.307
Wow. What's the special occasion?

02:31.309 --> 02:33.175
What, a girl can't just put a pretty on?

02:34.345 --> 02:36.429
Hmm.

02:36.431 --> 02:39.398
- Don't be mad.
- I'm not mad.

02:39.400 --> 02:40.933
I'm concerned.

02:40.935 --> 02:43.486
You need to have a life outside of work.

02:43.488 --> 02:44.987
It's not that easy.

02:44.989 --> 02:47.990
Yeah, well, it's easier if you try.

02:47.992 --> 02:51.193
We have a long flight ahead of us, so...

02:51.195 --> 02:53.446
Here's some reading material.

02:53.448 --> 02:56.949
Oh, dossiers, my favorite.

02:56.951 --> 02:58.584
Thanks.

02:58.586 --> 03:00.786
Monty, let's download everyone.

03:00.788 --> 03:01.787
Konnichiwa.

03:01.789 --> 03:03.623
American entrepreneur Damian Hall

03:03.625 --> 03:05.091
was found dead in Tokyo

03:05.093 --> 03:07.209
after a night of fine dining
with his brother Kristopher.

03:07.211 --> 03:08.878
Now, the two were visiting Tokyo

03:08.880 --> 03:10.379
for some business opportunities,

03:10.381 --> 03:12.932
and local police ruled
it a suicide by hanging.

03:12.934 --> 03:15.017
The Japanese call that Kubitsuri.

03:15.019 --> 03:17.303
Why are we traveling all the way
across the world for a suicide?

03:17.305 --> 03:19.138
It's the third American death by suicide

03:19.140 --> 03:20.473
in Tokyo within a week.

03:20.475 --> 03:22.275
The U.S. consulate
asked us to take a look.

03:22.277 --> 03:24.477
The first vic, Dee Brown,

03:24.479 --> 03:26.979
was engaged to be married
when she was found dead

03:26.981 --> 03:29.815
in a Japanese school
where she taught English.

03:29.817 --> 03:31.484
Her knees are tied together.

03:31.486 --> 03:35.037
That's Jigai, a historic form
of female ritual suicide meant

03:35.039 --> 03:37.657
to preserve a woman's
dignity after death.

03:37.659 --> 03:39.959
Second vic, Bobby Freeman, 32,

03:39.961 --> 03:41.210
male, a travel blogger

03:41.212 --> 03:43.245
who threw himself in
front of a bullet train.

03:43.247 --> 03:44.497
Tobikomi.

03:44.499 --> 03:46.499
Who knew there were so
many words for suicide?

03:46.501 --> 03:48.084
Well, the practice of suicide

03:48.086 --> 03:50.386
has been an integral part
of the Japanese culture,

03:50.388 --> 03:51.671
from the days of the samurai

03:51.673 --> 03:53.839
to the kamikaze pilots in World War II.

03:53.841 --> 03:56.926
To the Japanese, suicide
is considered honorable.

03:56.928 --> 03:59.345
Which explains why six Japanese citizens

03:59.347 --> 04:01.430
commit suicide in Tokyo per day.

04:01.432 --> 04:03.099
And what about Americans in Tokyo?

04:03.101 --> 04:05.851
On average, there's only
about five American suicides

04:05.853 --> 04:07.153
per year in all of Japan.

04:07.155 --> 04:09.155
So with three suicides in the past week,

04:09.157 --> 04:11.023
that's just over 33 times the norm.

04:11.025 --> 04:12.408
And why we're going.

04:12.410 --> 04:16.195
Damian Hall's body was found
in a place called Aokigahara.

04:16.197 --> 04:17.495
You're heard of it, Clara.

04:17.498 --> 04:20.750
Aokigahara is a park at
the base of Mount Fuji.

04:20.752 --> 04:22.668
Its name means "sea of trees,"

04:22.670 --> 04:25.087
but it has another
more nefarious name...

04:25.089 --> 04:26.539
Suicide Forest.

04:26.541 --> 04:28.374
Okay, well, that's not creepy at all.

04:28.376 --> 04:30.710
Aokigahara is the most
popular destination

04:30.712 --> 04:32.128
for suicides in all of Japan,

04:32.130 --> 04:34.513
averaging more than
one suicide per week.

04:34.515 --> 04:36.048
That park's in Tokyo?

04:36.050 --> 04:38.050
Negative, about two hours east.

04:38.052 --> 04:41.604
Did Damian rent a car,
take a cab, train, anything?

04:41.606 --> 04:43.639
There's Ben no credit
card or ATM activity

04:43.641 --> 04:45.608
ever since he left
dinner with his brother.

04:45.610 --> 04:46.892
So how did he end up there?

04:46.894 --> 04:48.811
That's what we're gonna find out.

04:48.813 --> 04:50.780
Monty, check the victims' background,

04:50.782 --> 04:52.982
see if there's any
connection between them.

04:52.984 --> 04:54.066
You got it.

04:54.068 --> 04:55.785
Since these were all seemingly suicides,

04:55.787 --> 04:57.820
the Japanese consider
them open-and-closed cases.

04:57.822 --> 05:00.039
But if this is foul play,

05:00.041 --> 05:03.743
whoever's doing it is showing
no signs of slowing down.

05:33.008 --> 05:38.573
- Synced and corrected by MasterCookie -

05:53.723 --> 05:56.190
A Japanese proverb tells us

05:56.192 --> 06:00.111
"the nail that sticks out
gets hammered down."

06:07.704 --> 06:10.788
Our contacts at the Tokyo
Metropolitan Police Department

06:10.790 --> 06:12.373
are on their way here to greet us.

06:12.375 --> 06:13.624
Oh, that's nice of them.

06:13.626 --> 06:15.409
Well, they're offended we're here.

06:15.411 --> 06:17.411
Oh. Okay, so not so nice of them.

06:17.413 --> 06:18.880
Well, our very presence here means

06:18.882 --> 06:20.331
that we're questioning
their investigation,

06:20.333 --> 06:23.167
which the Japanese see
as disrespectful.

06:23.169 --> 06:25.336
Jack, the ambassador has got
the Japanese government

06:25.338 --> 06:27.588
to grant you special
permission to carry a firearm.

06:27.590 --> 06:29.474
- And the rest of us?
- That's a negative.

06:29.476 --> 06:30.758
Jack is the rare exception

06:30.760 --> 06:32.510
because of his international
reputation and rank.

06:32.512 --> 06:34.011
Now, this is considered a high honor

06:34.013 --> 06:37.932
because guns have been
outlawed in Japan since 1971.

06:37.934 --> 06:39.517
Got your business cards ready, Jack?

06:39.519 --> 06:40.685
What, the badge, jet,

06:40.687 --> 06:42.520
and weapon clearance isn't enough?

06:42.522 --> 06:43.855
In Japan, business cards

06:43.857 --> 06:46.774
still play a huge role in
professional interactions.

06:46.776 --> 06:49.410
Yeah, it's considered rude to
not provide a business card

06:49.412 --> 06:50.828
to a new acquaintance.

06:50.830 --> 06:53.915
We need to build a bridge
between local law enforcement

06:53.917 --> 06:55.166
so we can have their blessings

06:55.168 --> 06:57.702
to take a look at these
supposed suicides.

06:57.704 --> 06:59.253
So we're saying hi to Mom and Dad

06:59.255 --> 07:01.372
before we take their
daughter out on a date.

07:01.374 --> 07:03.291
Except Dad doesn't have a baseball bat,

07:03.293 --> 07:05.676
he has a whole police force behind him.

07:05.678 --> 07:07.929
So everyone will follow my lead.

07:24.814 --> 07:26.397
Hajimemashite.

07:26.399 --> 07:28.482
Hajimemashite.

07:28.484 --> 07:30.484
FBI no Jack Garrett desu.

07:44.500 --> 07:48.386
That was intense.

07:48.388 --> 07:52.256
Silence in Japan shows credibility.

07:52.258 --> 07:55.426
Jack's using his calm
to convey authority.

07:55.428 --> 07:58.763
Jack rocks.

07:58.765 --> 08:01.399
Chief Superintendent Kazumi Fukui.

08:01.401 --> 08:03.184
Agent Jack Garrett.

08:03.186 --> 08:06.687
Your department's stellar
reputation precedes you.

08:08.408 --> 08:11.192
What can we assist the FBI with?

08:11.194 --> 08:12.860
We believe your findings

08:12.862 --> 08:14.328
on the recent American suicides

08:14.330 --> 08:16.113
have been investigated
with proper care,

08:16.115 --> 08:18.115
but we have American families back

08:18.117 --> 08:20.918
home who have lost loved
ones, and they need closure.

08:20.920 --> 08:23.204
So, with your permission,

08:23.206 --> 08:26.457
we'd like to take a closer
look at these cases.

08:32.881 --> 08:36.217
I'm officer Ryo Mirante.

08:36.219 --> 08:39.520
What makes you think that these
suicides are anything but?

08:39.522 --> 08:42.056
One of our agents spoke to the
families of the deceased,

08:42.058 --> 08:45.393
and all of the victims seem to
have had everything to live for.

08:45.395 --> 08:46.861
Dee Brown was to be married.

08:46.863 --> 08:49.063
Bobby Freeman's blog posts
were being picked up

08:49.065 --> 08:50.615
by major sites around the world.

08:50.617 --> 08:52.867
And Damian Hall was young, successful,

08:52.869 --> 08:54.235
about to close on a house.

08:54.237 --> 08:56.621
And none of them had a history
of mental health challenges.

08:56.623 --> 08:58.072
Even their latest social media posts

08:58.074 --> 09:01.208
were very positive, no
sign of what was to come.

09:01.210 --> 09:02.576
It's been our experience

09:02.578 --> 09:04.712
when someone had committed themselves

09:04.714 --> 09:06.580
to the whispering death,

09:06.582 --> 09:08.299
they show an uptick in happy behavior.

09:08.301 --> 09:11.135
They believe they have
finally found a direction.

09:11.137 --> 09:14.755
Even though it is death,
it is comforting to them.

09:14.757 --> 09:17.508
Your continued expertise
in this area is welcome,

09:17.510 --> 09:19.226
but three American suicides

09:19.228 --> 09:22.313
in a week deserves a closer look.

09:25.068 --> 09:27.435
Where would you like to
begin, Agent Garrett?

09:27.437 --> 09:30.104
Have you spoken to Damian's
brother, Kristopher?

09:30.106 --> 09:32.323
Yes, we took his statement.

09:32.325 --> 09:33.607
Kristopher said he had

09:33.609 --> 09:35.409
a business meeting the next morning,

09:35.411 --> 09:37.445
so he left the restaurant
to get some sleep

09:37.447 --> 09:39.530
while his brother stayed
behind, drinking.

09:39.532 --> 09:41.582
Hotel secretary confirms
that Kristopher

09:41.584 --> 09:44.001
returned to his room at
the time that he stated.

09:44.003 --> 09:45.870
What did the restaurant employees say?

09:45.872 --> 09:48.172
Damian's death was ruled suicide.

09:48.174 --> 09:49.457
Taking statements

09:49.459 --> 09:52.460
from any of the other
employees was unnecessary.

09:52.462 --> 09:55.763
But Kristopher is at his hotel,

09:55.765 --> 09:57.298
if you would like to speak to him.

09:57.300 --> 09:59.433
We may want to circle
back with him later,

09:59.435 --> 10:01.052
depending on our findings.

10:01.054 --> 10:03.270
- Of course.
- Can you escort Agent Simmons

10:03.272 --> 10:05.023
to where Damian's body was found?

10:05.174 --> 10:06.174
_

10:06.192 --> 10:08.893
And Agent Jarvis will
need to go to the morgue

10:08.895 --> 10:10.478
to examine his body.

10:10.480 --> 10:12.113
I will accompany her myself.

10:12.115 --> 10:13.814
Clara and I will go to the restaurant

10:13.816 --> 10:15.449
where Damian was last seen

10:15.451 --> 10:17.702
and question some of the employees.

10:21.541 --> 10:24.041
World famous Tsukiji Market.

10:24.043 --> 10:26.293
I've been to Tokyo more
times than I can count,

10:26.295 --> 10:27.712
and I've never been down here.

10:27.714 --> 10:30.464
Well, it's been around since 1923.

10:30.466 --> 10:32.049
This market handles more fish per day

10:32.051 --> 10:34.051
than any other market in the world.

10:34.053 --> 10:35.803
Explains the smell.

10:37.090 --> 10:39.840
You know, I know they wear
them for health purposes,

10:39.842 --> 10:42.009
but it's still hard to get used to.

10:42.011 --> 10:45.012
Mm-hmm.

10:45.014 --> 10:47.515
There's something on your mind.

10:47.517 --> 10:48.816
Sorry.

10:48.818 --> 10:51.185
I... I should be more
focused on the case.

10:51.187 --> 10:52.653
Yeah, when we're working.

10:52.655 --> 10:55.356
Right now, all we're doing is walking.

10:55.358 --> 10:57.074
Um...

10:57.076 --> 10:59.910
I guess, I, uh... I
feel like I'm having

10:59.912 --> 11:04.365
a hard time reconnecting
since we got home.

11:04.367 --> 11:06.283
Why?

11:06.285 --> 11:09.503
I guess D.C. has changed for me.

11:09.505 --> 11:10.871
Now it's...

11:10.873 --> 11:13.257
It's less of a place
and more of a time.

11:13.259 --> 11:16.127
A time when I was married.

11:16.129 --> 11:19.263
Well, I get that.

11:19.265 --> 11:23.050
My kids are growing up,
leaving the house,

11:23.052 --> 11:26.971
and, suddenly, home
feels a lot different.

11:26.973 --> 11:29.306
So what do you do?

11:29.308 --> 11:32.943
I guess we'll know when we're ready.

11:32.945 --> 11:34.695
Here we are.

11:34.697 --> 11:37.281
Let's go see what they
know about Damian.

11:39.786 --> 11:42.069
Because of bureaucratic delays

11:42.071 --> 11:44.238
in transporting the
bodies back to the U.S.,

11:44.240 --> 11:46.040
all three victims are still here.

11:46.042 --> 11:49.410
Oh, well, seems to be my lucky day.

11:49.412 --> 11:50.744
How is this lucky?

11:50.746 --> 11:53.247
It's just a saying.

11:53.249 --> 11:57.551
See, I'm lucky because all
three of the bodies are...

11:57.553 --> 12:00.304
I'm just gonna get to work.

12:00.306 --> 12:02.807
All right, antemortem contusions

12:02.809 --> 12:04.475
around the neck,

12:04.477 --> 12:06.427
along with the hyoid bone
being snapped, all point

12:06.429 --> 12:08.345
towards asphyxia.

12:33.589 --> 12:34.955
You see something?

12:34.957 --> 12:36.874
Yep.

12:39.679 --> 12:41.378
Do you see how, at the time of death,

12:41.380 --> 12:43.464
these bruises weren't there,

12:43.466 --> 12:45.216
now they are?

12:45.218 --> 12:47.968
But how?

12:48.876 --> 12:51.923
_

13:09.125 --> 13:11.408
The owners of these cars...

13:11.410 --> 13:14.995
They went in, but they didn't come out.

13:14.997 --> 13:16.297
Yeah.

13:39.488 --> 13:42.439
"Let's think once more about
the life you are given.

13:42.441 --> 13:44.525
Your parents, your brothers and sisters

13:44.527 --> 13:46.944
and children don't suffer alone.

13:46.946 --> 13:49.613
First, please contact somebody. ""

13:54.954 --> 13:58.289
Many of the elders believe
suicide is respectable

13:58.291 --> 13:59.707
and acceptable.

13:59.709 --> 14:02.876
But my generation doesn't
feel the same way.

14:02.878 --> 14:05.846
We are wary of this niche tourism.

14:05.848 --> 14:07.514
We don't want our country to be known

14:07.516 --> 14:11.185
as the suicide capital of the world.

14:11.187 --> 14:14.438
Some say the forest is
haunted by the victims

14:14.440 --> 14:16.774
of Ubasute.

14:16.776 --> 14:18.559
It's an old Japanese custom

14:18.561 --> 14:21.528
of leading elderly women to a forest

14:21.530 --> 14:24.982
and leaving them to die of
starvation or the elements,

14:24.984 --> 14:29.370
thus becoming vengeful
ghosts who prowl the forest.

14:31.374 --> 14:34.541
This is where we found Damian.

14:52.928 --> 14:55.929
- You have something?
- Yeah, wood shavings.

15:05.775 --> 15:08.409
I think this rope's been moved.

15:29.965 --> 15:31.799
Somebody installed this

15:31.801 --> 15:34.218
and had it focused on the crime scene.

15:34.220 --> 15:35.719
It has a transmitter.

15:35.721 --> 15:39.306
This is a network camera with
no storage capabilities.

15:39.308 --> 15:41.725
Whoever did this was
streaming the footage

15:41.727 --> 15:43.894
for viewing somewhere else.

15:46.198 --> 15:48.449
So the question is...

15:48.451 --> 15:50.818
Who's watching?

15:52.405 --> 15:54.288
Well, the kitchen staff was no help.

15:54.290 --> 15:55.656
What about the servers?

15:55.658 --> 15:57.825
They said Damian left
first, not Kristopher,

15:57.827 --> 16:00.210
which contradicts the statement.

16:00.212 --> 16:02.663
Why would Kristopher lie about
who left the restaurant first?

16:02.665 --> 16:04.248
Maybe he's hiding something.

16:06.719 --> 16:09.002
Simmons and Mae. Yeah, what do you got?

16:09.004 --> 16:10.888
On the tree where Damian was found,

16:10.890 --> 16:12.473
I noticed some marks,
and underneath it,

16:12.475 --> 16:13.590
some wood shavings,

16:13.592 --> 16:15.426
which suggest the rope
wasn't just swinging,

16:15.428 --> 16:16.760
that it was being pulled.

16:16.762 --> 16:18.429
Poor man's pulley system.

16:18.431 --> 16:19.930
If someone else was involved,

16:19.932 --> 16:22.349
it might explain how Damian
got all the way out there.

16:22.351 --> 16:24.184
We also found a camera.

16:24.186 --> 16:26.186
We believe someone may have
been filming all this.

16:26.188 --> 16:27.738
Already have Monty tracking the camera

16:27.740 --> 16:29.022
through the serial number.

16:29.024 --> 16:30.941
Let me know what else you find.

16:30.943 --> 16:32.192
Mae?

16:32.194 --> 16:34.528
I found perimortem bruising
on the other victims,

16:34.530 --> 16:36.914
which is called subcutaneous hypostasis

16:36.916 --> 16:38.999
or postmortem staining.

16:39.001 --> 16:41.452
Which tells us the vic was
physically manipulated

16:41.454 --> 16:43.954
or in some kind of confrontation
at the time of death.

16:43.956 --> 16:45.205
Bingo.

16:45.207 --> 16:47.040
Sorry to crash your party line, Jack,

16:47.042 --> 16:48.175
but Tokyo police have discovered

16:48.177 --> 16:50.210
another suicide in your vicinity.

16:50.212 --> 16:52.679
- American?
- They didn't say.

17:09.898 --> 17:12.398
Seppuku, better known as Harakiri.

17:12.401 --> 17:14.734
It's when the victim shoves a knife

17:14.737 --> 17:17.371
into their own stomach,
disemboweling himself.

17:17.373 --> 17:20.240
This case has nothing
to do with your case.

17:20.242 --> 17:22.542
This victim is Japanese, not American.

17:22.545 --> 17:23.794
We have two suicide victims

17:23.796 --> 17:25.829
from the same area within 24 hours.

17:25.830 --> 17:27.214
That cannot be a coincidence.

17:27.215 --> 17:29.833
It's not.

17:29.835 --> 17:31.919
Look at this watch.

17:31.921 --> 17:33.720
It's on his right wrist.

17:33.722 --> 17:35.889
Which means he's left-handed.

17:35.891 --> 17:37.808
And look at where the
hilt of the blade is.

17:37.810 --> 17:40.427
It's in his right hand.

17:40.429 --> 17:42.012
Someone staged this body.

17:42.014 --> 17:43.480
And he froze this way.

17:43.482 --> 17:45.766
He didn't kill himself.

17:45.768 --> 17:47.768
He was murdered.

17:47.770 --> 17:48.936
Jack.

18:18.267 --> 18:19.566
What do we know?

18:19.568 --> 18:21.768
Damian's body was indeed
staged and recorded.

18:21.770 --> 18:24.104
As well as the sushi chef's.

18:24.106 --> 18:26.356
All previous victims show
postmortem bruising,

18:26.358 --> 18:28.241
which proves that they
were physically attacked

18:28.243 --> 18:29.443
just before their deaths.

18:29.445 --> 18:32.946
So someone is using suicide
as a cover for murder.

18:32.948 --> 18:34.331
But why?

18:34.333 --> 18:37.033
Perhaps suicide left a
significant imprint

18:37.035 --> 18:39.169
on our unsub at an impressionable age.

18:39.171 --> 18:42.923
But unlike the American victims,
the sushi chef is Japanese.

18:42.925 --> 18:44.958
- So what's the pattern?
- It's not clear yet,

18:44.960 --> 18:47.761
but now that we know that this
is a murder investigation,

18:47.763 --> 18:50.514
I want to talk to
Damian's brother asap.

18:50.516 --> 18:52.716
I'm sorry to say, but the conclusion

18:52.718 --> 18:54.935
to your investigation was incorrect.

18:59.413 --> 19:02.189
_

19:03.040 --> 19:04.559
_

19:04.707 --> 19:07.444
_

19:07.600 --> 19:09.287
_

19:09.444 --> 19:11.550
_

19:15.741 --> 19:19.159
Perhaps we should look
deeper into this.

19:19.161 --> 19:21.328
Good.

19:21.330 --> 19:25.882
Then we're ready to deliver
our initial profile.

19:25.884 --> 19:28.335
Three of the four vics were
found in a local school,

19:28.337 --> 19:29.970
sushi restaurant, and subway.

19:29.972 --> 19:32.172
Which tells us our unsub is
familiar with the region.

19:32.174 --> 19:34.841
- A Tokyo resident.
- Yeah, statistically speaking,

19:34.843 --> 19:37.344
he is probably of Japanese descent.

19:37.346 --> 19:39.062
Based on his ability to reposition

19:39.064 --> 19:42.315
and overpower his victims,
he's most likely a male,

19:42.317 --> 19:44.901
six foot tall, 140 to 160 pounds.

19:44.903 --> 19:47.988
But the average Japanese
male is only about 5'7".

19:47.990 --> 19:49.689
So he's a big man on campus.

19:49.691 --> 19:51.691
That might be part of the problem.

19:51.693 --> 19:53.660
In Japan, you don't want to stand out,

19:53.662 --> 19:55.195
or you can be ostracized.

19:55.197 --> 19:56.830
Based on the ages of our vics,

19:56.832 --> 19:59.199
we believe he's between 25 and 35.

19:59.201 --> 20:01.668
And he's also streaming
his kills remotely,

20:01.670 --> 20:03.920
which means he's
technically sophisticated.

20:03.922 --> 20:06.506
- Then why film it?
- To admire his work.

20:06.508 --> 20:08.208
Yeah, his propensity towards voyeurism

20:08.210 --> 20:09.793
and the nature of these
blitz attacks tells us

20:09.795 --> 20:12.929
that he probably is incapable
of normal social interaction,

20:12.931 --> 20:14.714
and he may be unemployed.

20:14.716 --> 20:16.933
What of the suicides? Why fake them?

20:16.935 --> 20:19.553
Well, it's either a
forensic countermeasure,

20:19.555 --> 20:22.222
which has been working,
or it's a ritual.

20:22.224 --> 20:24.941
The staging of the bodies
must mean something.

20:24.943 --> 20:27.944
The unsub could be seeking
to purify his victims

20:27.946 --> 20:30.730
by giving them honorable deaths.

20:30.732 --> 20:33.283
There's no shame in the
act of suicide in Japan.

20:33.285 --> 20:36.536
But there is shame in
the act of murder.

20:37.906 --> 20:39.372
Monty, anything on the cell phone

20:39.374 --> 20:40.824
and camera we found?

20:40.826 --> 20:44.377
They were both bought at a Kuru
Tech vending machine with cash.

20:44.379 --> 20:46.630
Any common thread between our vics?

20:46.632 --> 20:48.081
Sorry, Jack, right
now, I'm striking out.

20:48.083 --> 20:50.166
- But I'll keep swinging.
- Good.

20:50.168 --> 20:53.303
Simmons, Mae, go grab
Damian's brother, Kristopher.

20:53.305 --> 20:54.921
I want to have a little chat with him.

20:54.923 --> 20:57.257
Clara and I will head
to the police station,

20:57.259 --> 20:59.843
interview the sushi chef's wife,

20:59.845 --> 21:01.595
see what her husband's story is.

21:11.440 --> 21:14.941
Mrs. Nakano, I'm Jack
Garrett with the FBI.

21:14.943 --> 21:17.360
This is Agent Clara Seger.

21:17.362 --> 21:19.112
Mind if we sit down?

21:24.536 --> 21:27.287
Mrs. Nakano, was your husband
a sushi chef his whole life?

21:27.289 --> 21:28.371
Yes.

21:28.373 --> 21:31.625
He took great pride in his work.

21:31.627 --> 21:33.293
But it came with a price.

21:33.295 --> 21:37.347
He had little time to
be father and husband.

21:38.967 --> 21:41.434
_

21:41.436 --> 21:44.804
Why did your husband leave
Daichan's after 30 years?

21:44.806 --> 21:48.642
He realized Daichan was
never going to retire,

21:48.644 --> 21:51.194
and if he did, he would most likely

21:51.196 --> 21:53.313
leave the business to his son.

21:53.315 --> 21:54.864
Did this cause any bad blood

21:54.866 --> 21:57.567
between your husband and his employer?

21:57.569 --> 22:00.987
He never spoke of such things to me.

22:00.989 --> 22:04.074
Once he left Daichan, he
cut all ties with him.

22:04.076 --> 22:05.992
Do you know of anyone
who would have wanted

22:05.994 --> 22:07.994
to hurt your husband?

22:11.049 --> 22:12.999
I'm not sure.

22:15.253 --> 22:19.339
My husband carried a great shame.

22:19.341 --> 22:20.924
It followed him all his life,

22:20.926 --> 22:24.511
but maybe it finally
caught up with him.

22:24.513 --> 22:27.180
Whatever it is, you can tell us.

22:27.182 --> 22:29.983
It's important that you
do, it can help others.

22:39.745 --> 22:41.661
Excuse me.

22:46.702 --> 22:49.202
What is it?

22:51.039 --> 22:54.708
His great shame was
that he was different.

22:54.710 --> 22:56.593
This feels like a dead end, Jack.

22:56.595 --> 22:57.877
Well, maybe not.

22:57.879 --> 23:00.213
Mrs. Nakano didn't know if
there was any bad blood

23:00.215 --> 23:01.715
between her husband and Daichan,

23:01.717 --> 23:03.717
so let's go right to the source.

23:03.719 --> 23:05.635
What's up, Jack?

23:05.637 --> 23:06.970
Monty, I need you to look

23:06.972 --> 23:09.305
into chef Daichan's sushi restaurant.

23:09.307 --> 23:11.808
I need to talk to the owner.

23:11.810 --> 23:13.943
The restaurant closed a month ago

23:13.945 --> 23:15.779
and there was no forwarding address.

23:15.781 --> 23:17.530
Track them down, asap.

23:17.532 --> 23:20.316
Hey. So I checked kris' room,

23:20.318 --> 23:22.452
the gym, bar area... No sign of him.

23:22.454 --> 23:24.738
Yeah, hotel surveillance shows
that he left 10 hours ago,

23:24.740 --> 23:26.156
and he hasn't returned.

23:26.158 --> 23:29.292
Hey, Monty... just the
man I'm looking for.

23:29.294 --> 23:31.077
I bet you say that to all the boys.

23:31.079 --> 23:33.463
So it seems that Kris
has flown the Coop.

23:33.465 --> 23:34.748
Can you get eyes on him?

23:34.750 --> 23:36.833
Or see if he skipped town.

23:36.835 --> 23:38.885
His passport hasn't
been scanned anywhere,

23:38.887 --> 23:40.553
so he's still in the country.

23:40.555 --> 23:42.972
No activity on his credit cards.

23:42.974 --> 23:45.759
But he did use his ATM
card 15 minutes ago

23:45.761 --> 23:48.261
at a liquor store not too far away.

23:48.263 --> 23:50.063
All right. Let's roll.

24:02.077 --> 24:04.077
To my big brother...

24:15.957 --> 24:18.174
We have stuff to do
tomorrow, so not too late.

24:18.176 --> 24:19.926
Okay, Mom.

24:47.122 --> 24:48.404
What the hell, man?

24:48.406 --> 24:50.206
Hey, hey. Kristopher Hall? FBI.

24:50.208 --> 24:51.658
We need to speak to you
about your brother.

24:51.660 --> 24:53.326
My brother's freakin' dead.

24:53.328 --> 24:55.829
Hey, Jack. Yeah, we
got Damian's brother,

24:55.831 --> 24:57.964
but he's got his wobbly boots on.

24:57.966 --> 24:59.666
Okay.

24:59.668 --> 25:01.501
You got it, see you soon.

25:01.503 --> 25:03.253
Okay, Jack said take
him back to the hotel

25:03.255 --> 25:04.304
and pump him with some coffee.

25:04.306 --> 25:05.922
He will meet us as soon as he can.

25:05.924 --> 25:07.891
Come on.

25:21.156 --> 25:23.072
Just waiting on the paperwork

25:23.074 --> 25:24.657
to go through so I can
take my brother home,

25:24.659 --> 25:26.776
or I'd be out of this place already.

25:26.778 --> 25:28.361
What brings you to Tokyo?

25:28.363 --> 25:30.747
Food, business, fun.

25:30.749 --> 25:32.499
This was supposed to be
the trip of a lifetime.

25:32.501 --> 25:33.616
What kind of business?

25:33.618 --> 25:34.918
Damian and I have a hedge fund company

25:34.920 --> 25:37.537
that's done fairly well
in the last few years.

25:37.539 --> 25:40.206
We recently put some money into
an American investment group

25:40.208 --> 25:42.542
that's redeveloping land in Tokyo.

25:45.380 --> 25:47.881
- Taylor investments.
- That's right.

25:47.883 --> 25:49.766
So what else aren't you telling us?

25:49.768 --> 25:52.051
I'm telling you everything.

25:52.053 --> 25:55.805
Like that your brother left the
restaurant first, not you.

25:58.860 --> 26:01.144
Our reputation is important
to our business.

26:01.146 --> 26:03.112
I didn't want it out there that
Damian left the restaurant

26:03.114 --> 26:06.032
first in the pursuit of some...

26:06.034 --> 26:08.234
Professionals.

26:08.236 --> 26:11.621
So can you describe
these professionals?

26:11.623 --> 26:13.740
Dark, tan skin, sunglasses.

26:13.742 --> 26:15.074
They were Japanese,

26:15.076 --> 26:17.410
but they had long, blonde,
surfer girl hair.

26:17.412 --> 26:19.495
Well, blonde, tanned,
sunglasses in Japan

26:19.497 --> 26:20.997
should make it easier to find.

26:20.999 --> 26:24.083
I'll see what Ryo and I can dig up.

26:24.085 --> 26:26.002
Excuse us.

26:29.341 --> 26:30.590
Thoughts?

26:30.592 --> 26:33.309
Well, he's using the present
verb tense when speaking.

26:33.311 --> 26:35.261
People who are guilty tend
to use the past tense.

26:35.263 --> 26:37.146
He's also provided
details in his story,

26:37.148 --> 26:38.982
even at his own expense.

26:42.270 --> 26:45.104
So, why don't you go take a
hot shower, get some rest.

26:45.106 --> 26:47.941
We might need to speak to you again.

26:47.943 --> 26:49.909
So be available.

26:54.666 --> 26:57.367
I'm all ears, Monty.

26:57.369 --> 26:59.285
Okay, Daichan and his wife,
Reiko, recently lost

26:59.287 --> 27:01.588
their business when the building
they leased their restaurant

27:01.590 --> 27:04.424
in for the last three
generations was sold.

27:04.426 --> 27:07.794
And then, Jack, they committed suicide.

27:18.773 --> 27:20.056
Jack?

27:20.058 --> 27:22.308
Jack, you okay? What was that?

27:22.310 --> 27:24.310
Yeah, I'm fine, Monty.

27:24.312 --> 27:26.729
But Kris Hall was just murdered.

27:30.823 --> 27:33.274
The room is empty. Unsub's gone.

27:33.276 --> 27:35.826
We found an unconscious security
guard near the back fire exit.

27:35.828 --> 27:38.445
Must have been how he got
out of here so quickly.

27:40.700 --> 27:42.366
Jack.

27:42.368 --> 27:45.869
I think he's using Kris'
computer to record all this.

27:48.874 --> 27:50.874
Turn it around.

27:52.962 --> 27:55.462
The unsub is not admiring his work,

27:55.464 --> 27:57.014
he's enjoying the aftermath.

27:57.016 --> 27:59.216
You rang?

27:59.218 --> 28:00.434
Monty, the camera

28:00.436 --> 28:02.553
that Simmons found in the
Suicide Forest was off,

28:02.555 --> 28:04.888
but that's because the police
had already been there.

28:04.890 --> 28:06.890
The unsub already got his fix.

28:06.892 --> 28:08.225
But the camera in the freezer

28:08.227 --> 28:09.977
was still on, just
like that one is now.

28:09.979 --> 28:13.564
Meaning the unsub is watching
us through Kris' laptop.

28:13.566 --> 28:15.699
See if you can find where
this feed is leading to.

28:15.701 --> 28:16.900
Give me a second to hack into

28:16.902 --> 28:18.619
the hotel's Internet connection.

28:18.621 --> 28:21.322
Your agent is hacking
into a Japanese hotel

28:21.324 --> 28:23.040
secured Internet connection.

28:23.042 --> 28:24.291
This is not protocol.

28:24.293 --> 28:25.542
I'm trying to catch a killer.

28:25.544 --> 28:27.578
There's no time for protocols.

28:27.580 --> 28:29.580
Okay, so the unsub is
bouncing the video

28:29.582 --> 28:31.749
off of a torrent-distributed
relay service.

28:31.751 --> 28:34.084
No central server, no log files.

28:34.086 --> 28:35.836
I cannot trace how many times

28:35.838 --> 28:37.721
the video's been accessed or by whom.

28:37.723 --> 28:39.890
I'm not going to be able to get an I.D.
here, Jack.

28:46.265 --> 28:48.265
Mae, did you learn
anything about the girls

28:48.267 --> 28:50.401
that Damian was with before he died.

28:50.403 --> 28:53.404
They're from an escort service
that specializes in Gyaru.

28:53.406 --> 28:56.190
It's a Japanese girly glam style.

28:56.192 --> 28:57.574
They use tanning beds, wigs,

28:57.576 --> 28:59.827
and sunglasses to look
like California girls.

28:59.829 --> 29:01.528
We reached out to the service,

29:01.530 --> 29:03.247
and we talked to the girls, and...

29:03.249 --> 29:05.115
- Their alibis checked out.
- Yes.

29:05.117 --> 29:06.417
Damian approached them

29:06.419 --> 29:07.868
and he didn't want to pay that much,

29:07.870 --> 29:09.837
and the girls went on
to find another job.

29:09.839 --> 29:11.338
How did you know that, Jack?

29:11.340 --> 29:12.623
Monty, is the company

29:12.625 --> 29:15.959
that bought chef Daichan's
Taylor investments?

29:15.961 --> 29:17.461
That's affirmative.

29:17.463 --> 29:19.963
The restaurant is our common thread.

29:25.471 --> 29:28.555
Jack, the common thread is
not just chef Daichan's,

29:28.557 --> 29:30.057
but where it sits.

29:30.059 --> 29:31.442
The Tsukiji Market.

29:31.444 --> 29:33.110
Taylor investment's business plan

29:33.112 --> 29:34.645
was to redevelop Tsukiji Market.

29:34.647 --> 29:37.481
Daichan and his wife
lost the sushi bar,

29:37.483 --> 29:39.983
committed suicide just prior to
the first American being killed.

29:39.985 --> 29:43.070
But Dee Brown is not
connected to the market.

29:43.072 --> 29:44.822
See, she died a week after Daichan

29:44.824 --> 29:46.323
and his wife committed suicide.

29:46.325 --> 29:47.791
Now, because she was
found in her school,

29:47.793 --> 29:49.827
no one noticed that all three victims

29:49.829 --> 29:51.545
live in the same building.

29:51.547 --> 29:53.964
Now, according to Dee's
checking account,

29:53.966 --> 29:55.666
she had been making monthly deposits

29:55.668 --> 29:57.468
to Daichan, who owned her apartment

29:57.470 --> 29:58.969
and subleased it to her.

29:58.971 --> 30:00.921
But there's a note here
saying that the payments

30:00.923 --> 30:02.473
were to stop this month.

30:02.475 --> 30:04.892
Yeah, she was getting
married, moving on.

30:04.894 --> 30:07.177
You know, the sushi chef's
wife said that her husband

30:07.179 --> 30:09.012
left Daichan's when he realized Daichan

30:09.014 --> 30:10.848
was gonna leave the
business to his son.

30:10.850 --> 30:13.066
Strange that the sushi
chef held out so long,

30:13.068 --> 30:14.651
knowing that is customary.

30:14.653 --> 30:17.187
Unless he thought there was
some reason Daichan's son

30:17.189 --> 30:18.906
could not fulfill that commitment.

30:18.908 --> 30:21.825
The police report said
that the son, Yukio,

30:21.827 --> 30:23.193
first heard the shot,

30:23.195 --> 30:25.279
found his parents dead,
then called it in.

30:27.082 --> 30:29.366
Okay, Yukio has no records and no I.D.

30:29.368 --> 30:31.919
Except for a birth certificate
going back 33 years.

30:31.921 --> 30:33.704
He's practically a ghost.

30:33.706 --> 30:34.955
Yukio is the only person

30:34.957 --> 30:37.207
at the center of this
who's still alive.

30:37.209 --> 30:39.259
The death of his parents
could have been the trigger.

30:39.261 --> 30:41.762
He blames all the victims
for his parents' suicide.

30:41.764 --> 30:44.381
That's why he's using
suicidal methods to kill.

30:44.383 --> 30:46.183
The blogger badmouthed the market,

30:46.185 --> 30:47.718
thus hurting Daichan's business.

30:47.720 --> 30:50.554
And the sushi chef left Daichan's
to go to a competitor.

30:50.556 --> 30:53.724
Dee Brown was moving, leaving
Daichan without a renter.

30:53.726 --> 30:55.642
And Taylor investments put
them out of business,

30:55.644 --> 30:57.611
making Damian and his brother
the nail in the coffin.

30:57.613 --> 30:59.780
We've got our unsub.

30:59.782 --> 31:02.866
Monty, we need Yukio's
family's home address.

31:31.030 --> 31:32.980
Clear.

31:43.692 --> 31:46.493
Password locked.

31:46.495 --> 31:48.695
Monty, we're in the unsub's apartment.

31:48.697 --> 31:50.364
Can you hack into his computer?

31:50.366 --> 31:52.783
Okay, I need you to look on the
back of the router for me.

31:55.588 --> 31:56.870
I've got it.

31:56.872 --> 31:58.505
Great, now read me the ESN.

31:58.507 --> 32:01.008
It should be nine hexadecimal
characters starting with...

32:01.010 --> 32:03.844
2-1-alpha-3-7-2-3-echo-1.

32:03.846 --> 32:05.846
How fast can you do this?

32:06.765 --> 32:09.132
Sorry it took me so long.

32:09.134 --> 32:10.851
I need you to find me anything

32:10.853 --> 32:12.803
that points to who the
next vic might be.

32:12.805 --> 32:15.305
Jack. The slot in the door,

32:15.307 --> 32:17.140
dirty dishes, all this take-out,

32:17.142 --> 32:19.359
it reminds me of something I
read about on the way over.

32:19.361 --> 32:21.311
- Hikikomori.
- Yes.

32:21.313 --> 32:25.315
Hikikomori is a sociological
phenomenon here in Japan.

32:25.317 --> 32:27.484
It's when young people
retreat into their rooms.

32:27.486 --> 32:28.902
They cut off all social ties

32:28.904 --> 32:31.989
and spend their time watching
TV or surfing the Internet.

32:31.991 --> 32:33.790
Yeah, some of them spend up to 30 years

32:33.792 --> 32:35.542
in their self-inflicted seclusion.

32:35.544 --> 32:36.627
What causes it?

32:36.629 --> 32:38.161
My people have a keen sense of shame

32:38.163 --> 32:40.747
if you do not live up
to social pressures.

32:40.749 --> 32:42.299
Well, the pressure to take
over the family business

32:42.301 --> 32:44.334
could have made Yukio retreat
back to his bedroom.

32:44.336 --> 32:45.836
That might explain why the sushi chef

32:45.838 --> 32:49.339
thought the son could never
take over the restaurant.

32:49.341 --> 32:51.341
So our unsub hears gunshots.

32:51.343 --> 32:53.810
He's forced to leave his
bedroom after many years,

32:53.812 --> 32:54.978
and then he finds his parents

32:54.980 --> 32:56.647
have committed suicide
in the living room.

32:56.649 --> 32:58.482
I think you may be correct, Simmons.

32:58.484 --> 33:00.817
Yukio has pictures of his
parents' dead bodies

33:00.819 --> 33:02.769
on his computer.

33:08.277 --> 33:10.527
How could they shoot
themselves if guns are banned?

33:10.529 --> 33:11.745
If you owned the gun

33:11.747 --> 33:14.331
prior to 1971, you were
allowed to keep them.

33:14.333 --> 33:16.166
Looks like an old Nambu
pistol from World War II...

33:16.168 --> 33:18.251
Probably belonged to Daichan's father.

33:18.253 --> 33:20.287
So Yukio is most likely armed.

33:22.041 --> 33:23.624
I found Yukio's hit list,

33:23.626 --> 33:26.209
and there's two extra names on it...
Sean Kagame,

33:26.211 --> 33:28.545
who is a Japanese-American businessman,

33:28.547 --> 33:32.049
and Jarod Taylor, the owners
of Taylor investments.

33:32.051 --> 33:33.684
One of them is Yukio's target.

33:33.686 --> 33:35.552
We need to find him before he does.

33:35.554 --> 33:37.854
Whoa, guys, I have an external device

33:37.856 --> 33:39.640
trying to contact the computer.

33:43.812 --> 33:46.113
He's recording again.

33:46.115 --> 33:48.281
Means he's about to strike.

33:48.283 --> 33:50.367
Hey, what happened?

33:52.404 --> 33:53.537
Yeah.

33:53.539 --> 33:55.072
So Yukio knows we're in his home

33:55.074 --> 33:58.458
and shut us down, but not
before I got his location.

33:58.460 --> 33:59.743
He's in a nightclub

33:59.745 --> 34:02.045
in Shibuya Crossing. I'm
sending the address now.

34:03.832 --> 34:06.383
Let's go.

34:41.120 --> 34:43.036
Ugh.

35:01.473 --> 35:02.839
Aah!

35:23.775 --> 35:26.393
Lock this place down... Nobody leaves!

35:33.535 --> 35:36.369
He's alive.

35:36.371 --> 35:38.488
- Yukio is here, watching.
- Yeah.

35:38.490 --> 35:39.789
He knows we were in his home,

35:39.791 --> 35:41.374
he can't go back there.

35:41.376 --> 35:44.711
To savor this moment, he's
got to stay here, in it.

35:44.713 --> 35:46.213
Which means we're looking
for the one person

35:46.215 --> 35:48.582
who is not filming.

35:48.584 --> 35:50.333
Jack, if he's been in
his room for years,

35:50.335 --> 35:52.502
chances are he has a
vitamin D deficiency.

35:52.504 --> 35:54.171
Look for rashes and rickets.

35:54.173 --> 35:55.922
He's also taller than the
average Japanese person,

35:55.924 --> 35:57.340
so he's gonna stick out in a crowd.

35:57.342 --> 35:58.975
He will be alone, his body language

35:58.977 --> 36:01.928
will be stiff and distant...
He's not used to these crowds.

36:43.722 --> 36:45.082
Yukio-kun.

36:45.403 --> 36:47.180
_

36:47.676 --> 36:50.365
_

37:08.580 --> 37:11.581
They did not care for me.

37:11.583 --> 37:14.834
They were ashamed.

37:14.836 --> 37:17.003
I was weak.

37:17.005 --> 37:18.922
I failed them.

37:18.924 --> 37:20.757
But now they have their revenge.

37:20.759 --> 37:23.176
You think that makes what you did okay?

37:25.514 --> 37:27.897
I gave them each an honorable death.

37:27.899 --> 37:30.984
Which is more than they deserved.

37:30.986 --> 37:33.603
My parents will finally be proud of me.

37:33.605 --> 37:35.605
There's no honor in what you did...

37:35.607 --> 37:36.990
For them or for you.

37:36.992 --> 37:39.442
You're wrong!

37:39.444 --> 37:41.611
What do you know about me?

37:41.613 --> 37:43.613
What do you know about us?!

37:43.615 --> 37:45.282
Yukio, listen to me.

37:45.284 --> 37:46.866
You can have honor.

37:46.868 --> 37:49.452
Turn yourself in right now, right here.

37:53.175 --> 37:55.125
I'm not done yet!

38:10.475 --> 38:11.975
You okay?

38:29.795 --> 38:33.997
Thank you for your assistance
and your understanding.

38:33.999 --> 38:37.334
We are much more flexible
than the world believes.

38:47.846 --> 38:49.679
So how much trouble are
you in with the boss lady

38:49.681 --> 38:51.681
for talking out of turn?

38:51.683 --> 38:55.402
Whatever it is, it was worth it.

38:55.404 --> 38:57.737
Hey.

38:57.739 --> 39:02.025
Please accept this as a
token of our appreciation.

39:02.027 --> 39:05.362
Only if you let me send you some
American whiskey in return.

39:05.364 --> 39:07.580
Twist my arm.

39:19.010 --> 39:20.760
So, any updates on our burn victim?

39:20.762 --> 39:23.179
Yeah, we were able to
get to Sean in time.

39:23.181 --> 39:24.881
He's gonna have a long
road ahead of him,

39:24.883 --> 39:26.349
but he's gonna be all right.

39:26.351 --> 39:27.884
And his business partner, Jarod,

39:27.886 --> 39:31.221
was found safe in their hotel room.

39:31.223 --> 39:34.808
You're not gonna lock yourself
in a room for 30 years, are you?

39:34.810 --> 39:38.395
No, our job sort of prevents that.

39:38.397 --> 39:40.029
Can I say something?

39:40.031 --> 39:43.149
Can I stop you?

39:43.151 --> 39:45.068
I admire you, Clara.

39:45.070 --> 39:47.821
You're so giving, so warm,

39:47.823 --> 39:50.874
so smart that sometimes
I want to punch you.

39:50.876 --> 39:54.244
But the longer that
you isolate yourself,

39:54.246 --> 39:56.796
the harder it's gonna be to
come back to the real world.

39:58.717 --> 40:01.835
So let's just rip off the
band-aid and go for it.

40:05.924 --> 40:07.640
Okay.

40:07.642 --> 40:09.008
Really?

40:09.010 --> 40:10.009
Yeah.

40:10.011 --> 40:12.395
But just you and I... No guys.

40:12.397 --> 40:15.148
I am not quite ready for
that excitement yet.

40:15.150 --> 40:18.268
Yeah, okay, cool. I'm
good with baby steps.

40:18.270 --> 40:19.436
Good.

40:19.438 --> 40:21.404
Let's go home.
