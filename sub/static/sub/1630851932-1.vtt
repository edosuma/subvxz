00:07.760 --> 00:09.560
I've got Lancaster's, Daniel.

00:11.040 --> 00:12.600
You might wanna give up, but I don't.

00:12.800 --> 00:16.640
Now, I don't care how risky
or illegal it is, I won't.

00:17.120 --> 00:20.960
If this doesn't work, I want you
to promise me you're gonna let me go.

00:22.840 --> 00:24.280
All right, I promise.

00:28.280 --> 00:29.920
Lee, this is Daniel Milton.

00:30.040 --> 00:33.480
Tell me a little bit about
this private location you have.

00:33.800 --> 00:37.040
I'm looking for a surgeon to perform a
procedure on an acquaintance of mine

00:37.360 --> 00:39.840
who doesn't want to go
through normal medical channel.

00:39.960 --> 00:41.960
Okay, I'll do it.
But I have a condition.

00:42.200 --> 00:44.640
I'd need to store something
down here for a while.

00:44.800 --> 00:46.840
And you're gonna
tell everyone she's dead?

00:47.240 --> 00:50.680
- And he actually thinks he can cure her?
- Yeah. Or Anna can.

00:51.160 --> 00:53.280
Beth hated me
for not doing what she asked me to.

00:53.640 --> 00:56.960
- What's the alternative?
- Well, we know what the alternative is.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.880
So tell me about this clinic
you've been working in.

01:00.040 --> 01:01.520
There's nothing
to tell, really.

01:01.640 --> 01:03.040
What... Oh, mate.

01:05.160 --> 01:07.320
You need to have a think about
what you're gonna do with him,

01:07.440 --> 01:08.960
because he can't stay here.

01:10.040 --> 01:11.080
You idiot.

01:11.200 --> 01:13.560
You need to be punished
for what you did to my Sebastian.

01:13.680 --> 01:16.240
- She's not looking great.
- Her kidneys are failing.

01:16.600 --> 01:17.760
No!

01:18.960 --> 01:20.280
I can't have an operation.

01:20.400 --> 01:23.120
You can if I perform it for you,
and you'll die if it doesn't happen.

01:23.280 --> 01:24.640
I don't want that on my conscience.

01:24.760 --> 01:27.000
Does that woman know
you've taken her kidney, Daniel?

01:28.480 --> 01:30.920
- Oh, fuck!
- So where is he?

01:32.400 --> 01:34.440
- No! Please!
- Shoot him!

02:22.880 --> 02:25.720
So... is it today?

02:26.680 --> 02:29.160
It is today.
How are you feeling?

02:30.920 --> 02:32.240
Excited.

02:33.120 --> 02:34.440
Me, too.

02:35.840 --> 02:36.960
Thank you.

02:37.600 --> 02:38.760
For what?

02:39.760 --> 02:42.720
Well, not letting me die
and dumping me in the sea.

02:43.560 --> 02:44.880
My pleasure.

02:47.600 --> 02:50.160
This flat's like our second home.

02:51.120 --> 02:52.240
Yeah.

02:53.200 --> 02:55.560
- Why? Do you want to stay?
- Oh, no way.

02:56.400 --> 02:57.960
I wanna go home.

03:00.040 --> 03:01.400
So do I.

03:15.200 --> 03:19.280
TEMPLE

04:38.400 --> 04:40.760
That's quite a story.

04:42.520 --> 04:48.560
It's almost unbelievable. You're
not dead, so that's the main thing.

04:48.720 --> 04:50.920
- No. Oh, yes.
- Yeah.

04:51.560 --> 04:55.480
You're no longer missing, obviously,
'cause you're... right here.

04:55.960 --> 04:57.720
Yes, that's right. I am.

04:59.200 --> 05:02.640
Still must have been a bit of a shock,
having your wife, what was it...

05:03.720 --> 05:06.840
"Knock on the door out of the blue
at 8 AM this morning"?

05:07.640 --> 05:09.480
- Yes, it was.
- Sure.

05:10.280 --> 05:11.680
But if I could just clarify,

05:11.840 --> 05:15.640
so you went off to this cottage
to pretend to kill yourself

05:15.800 --> 05:17.640
because you thought
you were dying?

05:17.840 --> 05:19.160
Yes.

05:20.040 --> 05:21.920
Isn't that slightly insane?

05:22.920 --> 05:24.840
Yes, I guess it is.

05:27.600 --> 05:32.200
Who knows how each of us
would respond, you know, to a...

05:33.240 --> 05:34.800
terminal diagnosis.

05:39.240 --> 05:42.840
Why didn't you look for her there?
I mean, it's your property, right?

05:43.240 --> 05:46.560
- Yes, it is. And I did.
- Yeah, that's right. He... He did.

05:48.320 --> 05:49.880
He didn't find you or...

05:51.720 --> 05:52.880
No.

05:53.640 --> 05:55.520
Because I... I hid.

05:56.360 --> 05:57.680
You... You hid?

05:58.160 --> 06:01.400
What, under the bed?
In a wardrobe? Or...

06:01.720 --> 06:04.440
Yeah, sorry.
That sounded crazy.

06:05.040 --> 06:07.560
No, I... I hid it on the beach.

06:17.520 --> 06:19.240
"The beach..."

06:21.720 --> 06:24.400
- So you had nothing to do with this?
- No.

06:24.640 --> 06:27.640
- You're a doctor, right?
- A heart surgeon.

06:27.720 --> 06:31.360
- You saved people's lives.
- Yes, I do.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.520
Well, I... I try.

06:37.080 --> 06:39.200
He's being modest.
He's a brilliant surgeon.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.800
- At which hospital?
- St Simon's.

06:48.320 --> 06:50.000
We're gonna need
to get them out of here.

06:50.320 --> 06:52.800
- What about the tunnels?
- Yeah, maybe?

06:53.200 --> 06:55.560
- Lee, keep it together.
- I killed someone.

06:55.680 --> 06:57.120
Lee, it was self-defence.

06:57.240 --> 07:01.120
- Jamie, make Lee some tea.
- Shall I make a pot or individual mugs?

07:01.920 --> 07:03.280
Pot!

07:04.920 --> 07:08.240
- I need to get that bullet out.
- Over here? Now?

07:08.520 --> 07:11.560
- Yes.
- Oh, fuck, fucking fuck!

07:13.040 --> 07:14.520
- Daniel?
- What?

07:19.920 --> 07:21.760
- Daniel!
- What?

07:39.720 --> 07:41.120
Get some water.

07:42.560 --> 07:43.760
Water!

07:44.720 --> 07:46.240
You happy in your work?

07:48.320 --> 07:50.040
Yes, very.

07:51.640 --> 07:54.160
- Did your wife have life insurance?
- No.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.720
So no financial claims made
since her apparent death?

07:59.240 --> 08:00.960
- None.
- No. You can check.

08:03.200 --> 08:06.400
- You both happily married?
- Oh, yes. Very.

08:06.480 --> 08:07.480
Absolutely.

08:07.600 --> 08:11.800
There's no secrets or lies?
No other people involved?

08:11.920 --> 08:13.200
No.

08:40.800 --> 08:43.000
I don't think we should
see each other any more.

08:45.160 --> 08:46.320
Right.

08:46.600 --> 08:49.320
You think this is a good way to start
the rest of your lives?

08:49.640 --> 08:51.120
We're violating her.

08:51.240 --> 08:54.000
No, we're not. We're saving her
from being complicit in two deaths.

08:54.120 --> 08:56.640
You're actually gonna tell her
she's been here this whole time?

08:56.760 --> 08:59.840
The less people that know
about the bunker, the better, right?

08:59.960 --> 09:04.120
Once Lee's finished clearing the place
out, we can forget it ever existed.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.160
What will you do?

09:13.000 --> 09:14.320
Move on.

09:15.520 --> 09:18.320
- So, Lancaster's.
- Yes.

09:19.080 --> 09:21.160
- You killed yourself?
- Yes.

09:21.640 --> 09:23.080
After years of working on a cure,

09:23.200 --> 09:28.280
you just happened to find it at
the very moment it would save your life?

09:28.520 --> 09:29.760
Yes.

09:30.480 --> 09:31.760
That was lucky.

09:33.320 --> 09:36.840
Well, I think the change in my
environment lent a helping hand.

09:36.960 --> 09:38.320
I'll say.

09:39.040 --> 09:42.560
Living mostly in nature,
away from the stresses of life.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.920
Not having me around,
for a start.

09:48.520 --> 09:51.960
We'd all be better off if we were allowed
the time to step away now and again.

09:52.040 --> 09:56.600
No... No news, no deadlines,
or sleepless nights.

09:57.320 --> 09:58.800
Everyone should try it.

09:59.080 --> 10:02.000
So you're completely
healthy now, then?

10:04.960 --> 10:06.280
Oh, my God, Daniel.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.720
I had to do it.
You would have died.

10:09.120 --> 10:10.800
But how? Where?

10:11.320 --> 10:13.520
- Here.
- Here, in this flat?

10:13.880 --> 10:16.800
Yes, and until it's completely healed,
you need to stay here and rest.

10:16.920 --> 10:18.200
You can't see Eve.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.840
Where did you get it?

10:23.120 --> 10:25.160
- Does it matter?
- Yes, Daniel. Of course it matters.

10:25.440 --> 10:28.520
- All that matters is that you're well.
- Just tell me.

10:29.560 --> 10:32.560
The hospital.
The transplant team helped me.

10:32.720 --> 10:34.720
So it should've gone to someone else,
someone who needed it?

10:34.840 --> 10:37.800
It did go to someone who needed it.
It went to you.

10:39.040 --> 10:40.840
But I feel healthy.

10:41.720 --> 10:44.960
But obviously I need
to get checked out properly.

10:46.160 --> 10:47.960
Now you make sure you do.

11:04.240 --> 11:06.760
Is that it? We can go?

11:08.800 --> 11:10.800
Yeah. Good to go.

11:19.440 --> 11:20.720
We did it.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.040
- Just keep walking.
- Relax. It's fine.

11:25.040 --> 11:28.160
- What was that about the beach?
- I don't know, it just came out.

11:32.240 --> 11:33.800
Can we just go and get Eve now, please?

11:33.920 --> 11:36.040
- We can't just turn up at the uni.
- I can't wait.

11:36.160 --> 11:38.000
- Well, you'll have to.
- Why?

11:39.120 --> 11:40.840
Because we need to prepare her.

11:41.960 --> 11:43.480
God, how will I be able
to get through the day?

11:43.640 --> 11:45.000
Yes, you will.

11:45.480 --> 11:47.840
Go and have fun.
Go and enjoy being alive.

11:47.960 --> 11:49.240
God, it's so weird.

11:49.720 --> 11:52.120
- Good weird?
- Yeah, it's amazing weird.

11:53.320 --> 11:54.960
Let's call her.

12:02.040 --> 12:04.840
Hi, Dad. Can I call you back?
I can't talk right now.

12:04.960 --> 12:06.400
Just making sure
you're okay for later.

12:06.600 --> 12:07.600
Later?

12:07.720 --> 12:09.880
Yeah, just checking,
you know that it's 5:00, not 6:00,

12:10.000 --> 12:11.560
'cause I think, at some point,
we said 6:00?

12:11.680 --> 12:14.440
- Yeah, fine.
- Where are you? You okay?

12:14.560 --> 12:17.200
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just...
I'm just running into lecture.

12:17.280 --> 12:19.160
Eve, are you serious?

12:19.280 --> 12:21.560
I've gotta go.
I'll see you later.

12:22.800 --> 12:24.040
Is she all right?

12:24.800 --> 12:26.160
Seems fine.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.000
Are we ready?

12:29.480 --> 12:32.160
We need to make sure
we drop it at the same time.

12:34.760 --> 12:37.160
- Stop! Police!
- Fuck, we need to do it now!

12:37.280 --> 12:39.360
- Shit.
- Eve, now!

12:40.360 --> 12:41.720
Stop!

13:07.360 --> 13:08.680
As for side transplants,

13:08.800 --> 13:10.880
we'll provide the advancement
we've been working towards

13:11.000 --> 13:12.760
for many, many years.

13:13.200 --> 13:16.120
And this is an opportunity to be at the
forefront of a radical breakthrough

13:16.240 --> 13:17.880
with minimal investment.

13:20.120 --> 13:22.240
This is very interesting territory.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.080
I agree.

13:25.080 --> 13:27.120
But it's completely theoretical.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.240
You have no data to demonstrate
the workings of your theory.

13:31.360 --> 13:33.560
It's very much a shot in the dark.

13:34.400 --> 13:36.920
- That's how breakthroughs happen.
- True.

13:37.360 --> 13:38.760
Not quite.

13:40.040 --> 13:43.960
Now, I was keen to meet you, out of
respect for your work with Beth Milton.

13:44.200 --> 13:46.720
- But I was sceptical.
- I see.

13:46.880 --> 13:49.360
As impressive as your presentation was,

13:49.480 --> 13:52.840
I'm afraid I haven't seen anything today
to change my mind.

14:01.560 --> 14:03.560
Ms. Willems.

14:04.160 --> 14:08.120
I'm sorry for the disappointment.
I really thought she'd go for it.

14:08.240 --> 14:09.800
Well, you were wrong.

14:12.520 --> 14:13.720
Doors closed.

14:13.840 --> 14:17.680
If you can prove this research
clinically on your own,

14:17.920 --> 14:20.000
then I think
we can talk again.

14:22.840 --> 14:24.080
- Prove it?
- Yes.

14:24.800 --> 14:26.560
You mean a human trial?

14:27.240 --> 14:28.520
Yes.

14:34.200 --> 14:35.960
- Morning, Mr. Milton.
- Morning, Victor.

14:36.040 --> 14:37.880
- Lovely morning.
- Beautiful.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.080
- Busy day?
- Very.

14:40.520 --> 14:43.320
- How's Eve?
- She's very well, thank you.

14:43.760 --> 14:45.760
- And the mother?
- Wonderful.

14:46.320 --> 14:48.240
Will you tell her I was asking after her?

14:48.360 --> 14:50.640
- I will.
- Have a lovely day.

14:51.520 --> 14:53.560
And you, Mr. Milton.

15:45.480 --> 15:46.800
What?

15:51.800 --> 15:53.040
Lovely.

15:54.400 --> 15:55.720
Well done, Joe.

15:55.920 --> 15:59.640
So... another hole
in aorta's been made.

16:00.640 --> 16:02.800
You can sew
the top end of the graft.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.880
Just here. Okay?

16:09.960 --> 16:11.720
Phones off, please.

16:14.760 --> 16:15.840
Right.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.120
So, when we're done here,
then we can move on...

16:26.120 --> 16:27.840
I'm sorry. Would you?

16:30.840 --> 16:32.680
Kill the call, please.

16:36.360 --> 16:37.800
So...

16:53.760 --> 16:55.280
Excuse me.

17:04.880 --> 17:08.840
Why're you calling me? I told you no
contact unless an absolute emergency.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.360
It is an emergency.

17:10.480 --> 17:13.400
- It's a catastrophe.
- Where are you?

17:14.360 --> 17:15.360
I'm in the bunker.

17:15.480 --> 17:17.760
- What?
- The bunker, okay?

17:17.960 --> 17:20.680
- You have to come right now.
- Stay there.

17:26.920 --> 17:28.160
I have to go.

17:28.320 --> 17:31.320
So, Joe, would you mind doing
the second top end, closing up?

17:32.360 --> 17:33.680
Good.

18:08.200 --> 18:09.400
Lee?

18:09.840 --> 18:11.080
Lee!

18:30.720 --> 18:35.000
Daniel!
Through here. Quick!

18:40.600 --> 18:42.120
This way.

18:52.640 --> 18:53.960
Look.

18:59.600 --> 19:02.680
I thought this was supposed to be
a foolproof plan.

19:04.560 --> 19:09.920
I can't predict the weather, can I?
The water must've risen or... something.

19:23.440 --> 19:25.960
Then why didn't you just
get out of here like I said?

19:26.080 --> 19:28.600
What? Now?
Why would I do that?

19:29.120 --> 19:33.040
- We need bolt cutters to cut it free.
- And why did you call Anna?

19:33.160 --> 19:37.200
Why wouldn't he call Anna?
Lee, do you have bolt cutters?

19:37.680 --> 19:39.320
Yeah. I'll go and get some.

19:45.040 --> 19:47.680
- What?
- Can't you see how vulnerable he is?

19:54.360 --> 19:57.560
We tried that before.
It's not gonna work. It's stuck.

20:16.320 --> 20:20.240
- It's not caught on the chain. Look.
- So what is it caught on, then?

20:23.400 --> 20:25.240
Hang on, what's this?

20:27.840 --> 20:29.320
Here we go.

20:30.640 --> 20:32.640
Stuck on something down here.

20:36.920 --> 20:39.760
- What are you doing?
- Well, it's clearly a two-person job.

20:39.880 --> 20:42.600
No, no, no, it's okay.
I've got it.

20:42.920 --> 20:45.600
- Fine.
- Besides, you're all dressed up.

20:47.760 --> 20:50.320
Yeah, I had a breakfast date.

20:57.240 --> 20:59.880
Sonar and other manmade
underwater noises

21:00.000 --> 21:02.520
may contribute
to the beaching of whales.

21:02.640 --> 21:05.160
Sonar is used by military
to detect submarines.

21:05.280 --> 21:06.760
Shit!

21:14.600 --> 21:15.960
So did you tell her yet?

21:16.960 --> 21:18.640
- Who?
- Beth.

21:19.080 --> 21:20.080
Did I tell her what?

21:20.440 --> 21:22.480
That I was the one
who came up with a cure.

21:22.600 --> 21:25.360
What? No. No, I haven't.
Not yet. No.

21:28.920 --> 21:31.040
- Well, you need to.
- Yeah, I will.

21:31.160 --> 21:32.880
- I will.
- I want to get on with my life.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.760
- I need to rebuild my career.
- Don't you think I want that too?

21:35.920 --> 21:38.000
Quick, quick.
Someone's coming.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.240
Quick.

22:39.840 --> 22:42.480
The climate crisis has seen
a plague of mosquitoes

22:42.600 --> 22:44.880
arrive on the British mainland...

22:55.640 --> 22:58.160
What the hell have you
been doing down here?

22:58.280 --> 23:00.000
Have you been out at all?

23:04.400 --> 23:06.920
What about Jamie?
Did he make it out of London?

23:07.800 --> 23:10.400
- Not exactly.
- What do you mean, not exactly?

23:11.240 --> 23:13.440
- He's gone to hand himself in.
- What?

23:14.760 --> 23:15.760
And you let him?

23:15.880 --> 23:20.520
How could I stop him? He couldn't
handle never seeing his little boy again.

23:21.280 --> 23:23.160
Well, that's it.
You can't stay here.

23:23.400 --> 23:25.640
- I am staying here.
- After what's just happened?

23:25.800 --> 23:28.520
- Are you completely insane?
- No, look, calm down.

23:28.640 --> 23:31.840
- Nobody can get down here.
- They just did!

23:32.080 --> 23:34.720
Look... I'm blocking it all off. Yeah?

23:34.920 --> 23:37.720
There's only one way in and out,
and it's totally impossible to find.

23:37.880 --> 23:40.880
Lee, this is crazy.
Just leave.

23:41.320 --> 23:43.280
Why the sudden concern?

23:43.400 --> 23:45.960
You weren't so bothered when
you just fucked off.

23:46.080 --> 23:48.400
- You told me to fuck off.
- What's that got to do with it?

23:48.800 --> 23:49.920
Everything.

23:50.040 --> 23:52.240
Why is everything so elementary
with you?

23:52.360 --> 23:53.360
What are you talking about?

23:53.480 --> 23:56.240
I'm talking about the complexities
of human relationships.

23:56.440 --> 23:58.200
Lee, you categorically told me

23:58.320 --> 24:00.760
you never wanted to see
my patronising fucking face again.

24:00.880 --> 24:02.440
Forgive me for not popping down
for a cup of tea.

24:02.560 --> 24:04.080
But that's what
friendship is.

24:04.200 --> 24:05.960
What, ignoring someone
when they tell you to drop dead?

24:06.080 --> 24:07.080
- Yes!
- Right.

24:07.200 --> 24:09.440
- Okay, I didn't realise.
- Well, now you know.

24:09.800 --> 24:10.800
But in the future,

24:10.960 --> 24:13.800
when a friend tells you to fuck off 'cause
they're feeling betrayed and used,

24:13.920 --> 24:17.200
you don't just stay away,
you try and make amends!

24:23.880 --> 24:25.200
Okay.

24:26.560 --> 24:27.840
Okay.

24:29.160 --> 24:31.000
Now let me take a look at that foot,
please, it's bleeding.

24:31.120 --> 24:32.360
I can do it.

24:33.320 --> 24:36.000
Bye, Lee.
We'll come to see you soon, okay?

24:37.240 --> 24:39.920
Thanks for that stuff
you brought down last time.

24:40.040 --> 24:41.440
Yeah, no worries.

24:43.480 --> 24:44.840
See you later.

24:56.360 --> 24:57.760
I can do it.

25:02.720 --> 25:05.320
So you and Anna have
seen each other since...

25:06.120 --> 25:07.480
well, before today?

25:07.840 --> 25:10.200
Yeah, we've been
supporting each other.

25:13.080 --> 25:15.360
She doesn't think it's a bad idea
coming down here?

25:15.520 --> 25:18.120
Well, maybe.
But she comes anyway.

25:20.800 --> 25:22.560
Because she's a good friend.

25:25.080 --> 25:28.000
Well, you two might think it's okay
to be down here, but I don't.

25:28.120 --> 25:30.880
I'm sorry if you think
that makes me a bad friend.

25:31.960 --> 25:35.200
So, what? You're never coming
down here again, then?

25:35.320 --> 25:37.880
Lee, the plan was
for none of us to be down here.

25:43.600 --> 25:46.680
Guess that means we won't see
each other again, then.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.960
Yeah, I guess it does.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.120
You want some dry clothes?

26:02.680 --> 26:05.680
- I still can't believe it.
- Alive and well. I know.

26:06.360 --> 26:08.960
I guess I'm gonna have to get used
to some extreme reactions.

26:09.160 --> 26:12.560
Yeah. A resurrection
doesn't happen every day.

26:13.280 --> 26:15.040
So, what are we doing?

26:16.200 --> 26:17.360
I don't know.

26:18.800 --> 26:21.760
Maybe shorter?
Something different.

26:22.760 --> 26:25.760
- Proper gear, that is.
- Proper, as in?

26:26.360 --> 26:29.080
Top gear.
None of your cheap, shitty stuff.

26:29.800 --> 26:31.280
Well, thank you.

26:33.120 --> 26:34.520
I appreciate it.

26:36.320 --> 26:37.920
It's just here.

26:43.440 --> 26:45.680
This is the only way home.

26:47.840 --> 26:50.800
Now, you turn left at the top,
walk for about 10 minutes,

26:50.920 --> 26:52.200
then you'll come to a gate.

26:52.320 --> 26:55.640
- When you come back down...
- I won't be coming back down.

26:55.880 --> 26:57.800
- If you do.
- I won't.

27:57.840 --> 27:59.720
I just hope it stays up long enough
for people to see it.

27:59.880 --> 28:01.000
Yeah.

28:01.200 --> 28:04.880
What we really need is more radical,
inventive actions, you know?

28:05.000 --> 28:06.400
Yeah. Like what?

28:07.080 --> 28:09.240
I don't know.
Why don't you come up with something?

28:09.400 --> 28:10.480
Me? No.

28:10.600 --> 28:13.560
- I've only been to a handful of meetings.
- So?

28:13.800 --> 28:15.640
- You're committed, aren't you?
- Yeah.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.560
Or are you gonna take up a new hobby
next week and disappear?

28:18.680 --> 28:21.680
- No.
- Yoga. Pilates. Helping the homeless.

28:21.800 --> 28:23.760
- Come on, Ash.
- No, it happens.

28:23.960 --> 28:25.840
One week, it's all guns blazing,
and next, it's...

28:26.000 --> 28:27.640
I'm totally committed.

28:27.760 --> 28:30.080
Cool. Come up
with something, then.

28:30.200 --> 28:34.400
Yeah? All right. I'm late for work.
I'm gonna see you later. All right?

28:37.880 --> 28:39.600
God, I love it.
Thank you.

28:40.400 --> 28:43.040
So, when's the
"welcome back from the dead" party?

28:43.160 --> 28:46.200
- I need to see Eve first.
- You haven't seen Eve yet?

28:46.320 --> 28:49.840
- No. I didn't wanna drag her out of uni.
- She's left.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.960
- She's left?
- Eve's left university.

28:54.520 --> 28:56.640
Sorry. I thought you knew.

29:05.200 --> 29:06.840
- Beth.
- Daniel?

29:07.120 --> 29:09.920
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Tell you what? What do you mean?

29:10.040 --> 29:12.440
About Eve.
The hairdresser just told me.

29:12.600 --> 29:14.440
- She's left uni.
- Of course she hasn't.

29:14.600 --> 29:17.640
Yes, she has, weeks ago.
Have you even been in contact with her?

29:17.760 --> 29:18.760
Of course I have.

29:18.880 --> 29:21.240
- When was the last time you saw her?
- I see her all the time.

29:21.360 --> 29:23.120
- Yeah, well, it doesn't sound like it.
- Oh, thank God. Mr. Milton.

29:23.240 --> 29:24.560
I have to go. What's happened?

29:24.680 --> 29:28.160
One of the girls from the cafe just
collapsed. Excuse me. Just a second.

29:28.760 --> 29:33.080
Okay, people, bit of space, please.
Mr. Milton will take it from here.

29:43.880 --> 29:47.720
I'm so sorry. This is ridiculous.
They're giving you a bed now.

29:49.400 --> 29:50.880
Has this happened before?

29:51.840 --> 29:54.400
- Yeah.
- Well, why didn't you call me?

29:55.880 --> 29:58.840
- I have another doctor now.
- Where, here?

30:00.000 --> 30:01.960
Hughes explained everything to me.

30:02.920 --> 30:05.160
I'm sicker than before.

30:06.160 --> 30:08.600
We'll sort it out for you,
I promise.

30:10.800 --> 30:12.200
I know what you did.

30:14.720 --> 30:16.040
What do you mean?

30:17.480 --> 30:18.760
The kidney.

30:30.560 --> 30:34.120
- Look, I don't know what you think...
- I don't think.

30:35.920 --> 30:37.200
I know.

30:38.160 --> 30:39.160
I can explain.

30:39.280 --> 30:41.840
And I won't be taken
advantage of any more.

30:43.080 --> 30:44.240
I want money.

30:45.520 --> 30:47.160
- Sorry, what?
- I want money.

30:47.760 --> 30:49.600
For my kidney.

31:04.440 --> 31:07.520
- I don't have any money.
- And I don't have my kidney.

31:08.880 --> 31:11.680
I don't have friends and family.

31:13.120 --> 31:15.320
And I don't have
the means to get home.

31:16.080 --> 31:18.680
No... I get it. I get it.

31:20.480 --> 31:22.120
I'll bring you some cash.

31:25.560 --> 31:27.000
No.

31:28.960 --> 31:30.440
Not like that.

31:31.320 --> 31:34.800
- I don't understand.
- I want money. The price of my kidney.

31:36.440 --> 31:37.800
- That's...
- Fifty thousand.

31:37.920 --> 31:40.360
That... Yeah,
that's not possible.

31:48.160 --> 31:50.240
What is that place
you took me to?

31:50.760 --> 31:53.480
And how many more people
have you done this to?

31:53.600 --> 31:56.440
What? No. No one.
No. You're the only one.

31:59.240 --> 32:01.080
I want my money by tomorrow.

32:02.160 --> 32:04.240
Or I'll tell my story to everyone.

32:05.400 --> 32:06.680
Everyone.

32:16.120 --> 32:17.600
It's today.

33:20.520 --> 33:21.960
More light, please.

33:25.920 --> 33:28.360
I'm sewing the top end of the graft.

33:44.960 --> 33:46.800
Oh, shit.

33:48.240 --> 33:49.880
Clamp.

33:57.360 --> 33:58.600
Suction, please.

34:02.280 --> 34:04.520
Look, we need
to get him on bypass now.

34:05.640 --> 34:06.640
Out of the way.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.800
I just think we need to focus
on stabilising...

34:08.920 --> 34:10.720
- I think I know what we need to focus on.
- But if we don't regulate...

34:10.840 --> 34:12.400
Just step away now!

34:19.360 --> 34:21.160
Yeah, it's awful. We...

34:21.320 --> 34:24.080
We shouldn't have allowed you back
to work so soon after Beth's death.

34:24.200 --> 34:26.720
- He was undermining my authority.
- He was doing his job.

34:26.840 --> 34:27.960
Well, he overstepped the mark.

34:28.120 --> 34:30.880
Daniel, your colleagues
are worried about you.

34:32.200 --> 34:33.880
- They needn't be.
- I'm worried.

34:34.920 --> 34:37.240
I have a duty of care.
Since Beth died...

34:37.400 --> 34:39.800
Look, why do you
keep mentioning Beth?

34:41.200 --> 34:42.480
Daniel.

34:42.840 --> 34:47.280
I like to think that we've always been
fair and supportive following...

34:47.480 --> 34:49.360
your recent
personal circumstances.

34:49.520 --> 34:53.080
However, your conduct today leads me
to believe that you're not fit for work.

34:54.400 --> 34:55.400
This is ridiculous.

34:55.520 --> 34:57.520
You left theatre
this morning to make a call.

34:57.640 --> 34:59.640
You made a near-catastrophic
error just now.

35:00.080 --> 35:03.360
You delayed putting a patient
straight on to bypass and...

35:05.440 --> 35:08.280
frankly, you're dressed
very strangely.

35:08.680 --> 35:10.080
Oh, for God's sake.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.360
I'm suspending
you until further notice.

35:14.200 --> 35:16.200
You're what? No, no, no.
No, no. You can't do that.

35:16.320 --> 35:17.760
You've left me no choice.

35:18.520 --> 35:21.680
Why, what're you gonna do?
You're gonna have me thrown out?

35:24.680 --> 35:29.360
Mr. Milton, I'm so sorry... but I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to ask you for your pass

37:21.640 --> 37:22.880
You're back.

37:24.760 --> 37:26.720
Suzana knows about the kidney.

37:27.200 --> 37:28.400
Oh, God.

37:28.600 --> 37:30.680
- She wants £50,000.
- Oh, fuck!

37:31.880 --> 37:34.200
I... need your help.

37:35.920 --> 37:38.160
- We need to do some jobs.
- Jobs?

37:40.560 --> 37:42.280
- Jobs?
- Surgeries, yes.

37:43.320 --> 37:44.800
Here. I can't see any other way.

37:44.920 --> 37:47.800
But we can't bring anyone down here,
you said so yourself.

37:47.920 --> 37:50.520
Well, what else can we do?

37:56.320 --> 37:58.280
- What about that guy?
- What guy?

37:58.440 --> 37:59.560
That guy.

38:00.560 --> 38:02.440
- The guy?
- Yeah.

38:03.960 --> 38:05.880
We said we'd have
nothing to do with him.

38:06.440 --> 38:09.080
- It's not right, you know?
- What do you mean, not right?

38:09.200 --> 38:10.760
I mean, it's not right.

38:10.880 --> 38:13.320
Would you know any other guy
who can get us £50,000 just like that?

38:13.440 --> 38:15.240
Yeah, but him? Really?

38:16.040 --> 38:17.800
I don't know. I...

38:18.080 --> 38:22.480
I mean, that guy just seems big, right?
That is a big thing to do.

38:25.440 --> 38:26.560
Call him.

38:26.680 --> 38:28.240
- Now?
- Yeah.

38:29.560 --> 38:31.080
Shit, I have to go.

38:33.800 --> 38:35.440
Call him now.

38:57.040 --> 38:58.400
Dad.

39:01.000 --> 39:04.440
- What are you wearing?
- Well, I'm...

39:04.520 --> 39:06.680
- I'm so sorry I'm late.
- It's fine.

39:06.800 --> 39:10.600
Should we go home before you're
arrested for wearing that outfit?

39:11.000 --> 39:14.600
Would you mind if we took
a little walk first?

39:36.680 --> 39:38.440
- And you didn't know?
- No.

39:39.800 --> 39:42.440
I mean,
not until this morning.

39:46.080 --> 39:49.000
So... So she...

39:51.920 --> 39:53.440
Right now...

39:55.200 --> 39:56.960
she's waiting for me?

39:58.000 --> 39:59.440
She is, yes.

40:25.280 --> 40:27.080
Are you sure
there's not been a mistake?

40:27.640 --> 40:30.200
You can't have been there
two months.

40:32.400 --> 40:33.600
I see.

40:33.720 --> 40:35.400
You were definitely only there one week.

40:35.560 --> 40:38.480
Yeah. Thank you. That's great.

40:52.680 --> 40:54.040
You ready?

41:09.720 --> 41:11.240
Sweetheart?

41:24.200 --> 41:25.840
Where is she?

41:27.920 --> 41:29.320
Dad?

41:35.000 --> 41:36.320
Mum.

41:48.080 --> 41:49.520
Oh, darling.

42:45.840 --> 42:47.600
So you wanna work?

42:48.520 --> 42:50.200
I do, yes.

42:50.640 --> 42:52.320
You're four minutes late.

42:52.840 --> 42:54.280
Am I?

42:54.920 --> 42:56.760
I don't do lateness.

42:57.880 --> 43:01.160
- No, but the guy at the reception...
- All excuses.

43:02.880 --> 43:05.520
No. Right.

43:07.440 --> 43:09.360
I apologise for my lateness.

43:21.640 --> 43:24.000
I need absolute confidentiality.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.360
I understand.

43:27.040 --> 43:28.520
Total discretion.

43:29.120 --> 43:30.320
Of course.

43:31.520 --> 43:33.440
And impeccable timing.
