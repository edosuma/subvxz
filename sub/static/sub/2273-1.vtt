02:41.452 --> 02:45.432
- Hey, you need help?
- No, I'm just looking.

02:45.832 --> 02:48.735
Well, what exactly
is your range, price-wise?

02:48.835 --> 02:50.712
Depends, what do they cost?

02:51.311 --> 02:54.032
Well, we got little ones and big ones.

02:54.132 --> 02:58.453
- Big ones start at about three thousand.
- No senior citizen discount?

02:58.553 --> 03:02.207
I sell headstones at a senior
citizen discount, I won't last long.

03:02.307 --> 03:03.984
What do you got on the small scale?

03:05.553 --> 03:08.088
Well, the one you were looking at,
that starts at three hundred.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.589
That's pretty good for a budget.

03:09.689 --> 03:13.501
Yeah, but these are shit, people step
on 'em, they wear the words off.

03:13.601 --> 03:15.637
Well, they ain't cheaper
'cause they're better.

03:15.737 --> 03:18.681
Well, the VA's picking up the tab for the
funeral but I gotta pay for the headstone.

03:18.781 --> 03:21.851
Oh, pay for the funeral, that's nice.

03:22.051 --> 03:26.247
Listen, you're a vet,
I'll give you five percent,

03:26.347 --> 03:28.316
plus we'll throw in some flowers.

03:28.416 --> 03:32.237
I'm sure that's a comfort
to dying vets everywhere. Come.

03:32.337 --> 03:35.156
Listen, you want me to
hold anything for you?

03:35.256 --> 03:37.367
Let me think about it, I got time.

03:37.467 --> 03:39.304
Here, pop. Right here. Come on.

03:40.595 --> 03:43.305
Yeah, people always think they got time.

03:52.106 --> 03:53.810
So...

03:55.823 --> 03:59.297
- how'd it go?
- It was lovely. What do you think?

03:59.697 --> 04:02.198
I think it was a bad idea to begin with.

04:04.577 --> 04:07.397
- Did you pick something?
- Dying ain't cheap.

04:07.497 --> 04:11.693
It costs less to pay you to stand in the
cemetery and point at my grave all day.

04:11.793 --> 04:13.778
Will you get off the goddamn cellphone?
It's illegal.

04:13.878 --> 04:15.405
Are you kidding?
How did you know that I was...

04:15.505 --> 04:16.990
Can you hear me pushing
the buttons or something?

04:17.089 --> 04:19.200
You're driving like an idiot,
you're all over the road.

04:19.300 --> 04:20.660
Okay, I'm just... I'm trying to tell Ann

04:20.760 --> 04:22.996
that this is taking a little bit
longer than I thought,

04:23.096 --> 04:25.498
and that I'm going to be late
for dinner. That's all.

04:32.897 --> 04:34.022
Hey.

04:42.573 --> 04:43.865
Hey!

04:48.871 --> 04:50.872
Easy, boy.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.515
Speed limit's 25.

04:57.463 --> 05:00.842
Thanks a lot fucking asshole.

05:01.342 --> 05:04.928
I gotta live here, Will. Don't make them
hate me, I can do that on my own.

05:06.347 --> 05:08.181
What's it look like?

05:08.933 --> 05:10.877
It's nice.

05:10.977 --> 05:15.838
It is... you know,
the houses are close together, but...

05:17.066 --> 05:20.619
It reminds me of that place
we used to live in when I was a kid.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.806
Any jerk-offs staring at us?

05:23.906 --> 05:25.572
Yeah.

05:26.200 --> 05:29.237
Yeah, they are. Yep.
But, I mean, who can blame them,

05:29.337 --> 05:32.539
this is probably the most exciting thing
that's happened to them in a month.

05:36.419 --> 05:38.238
Jesus, what's his problem?

05:38.338 --> 05:42.132
It's you. You have your mother's scent.

05:45.345 --> 05:48.972
That's the first time you've mentioned
her since her funeral, pops.

06:02.445 --> 06:03.904
Come.

06:06.282 --> 06:09.284
- Dad, wait for me, I'll be right there.
- I got it.

06:17.168 --> 06:19.920
- Mailbox on your right.
- Thanks.

06:20.755 --> 06:23.006
Hold on, pops, let me get your bags.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.593
Looks like we beat the movers here.

06:30.681 --> 06:32.834
Sounds empty.

06:32.934 --> 06:34.252
Yeah.

06:34.352 --> 06:37.045
I feel like I'm dropping
you off at prison.

07:22.775 --> 07:26.871
You don't look like
a necklace kind of guy.

07:27.271 --> 07:29.849
I can't see you,
but you smell beautiful.

07:29.949 --> 07:32.776
Oh, thank you very much.

07:33.870 --> 07:37.231
- Did you just move next door?
- Yes.

07:37.331 --> 07:39.984
It's so nice to see
a new face around here.

07:40.084 --> 07:43.738
It's nice to hear somebody referring
anything of me as "new."

07:43.838 --> 07:45.573
- Delores.
- Ambrose.

07:45.673 --> 07:46.866
Hello, Ambrose.

07:46.966 --> 07:49.369
- Hello, Delores.
- Hello, hello.

07:49.469 --> 07:52.562
Delores... Can you tell me what that is?

07:57.429 --> 08:00.254
- Claw-something? Some kind of claw?
- Dad?

08:00.354 --> 08:04.509
You know I really don't like it when you
go walking around without Shadow like that.

08:04.609 --> 08:07.762
I'm sorry, excuse me, my name's Will.
I'm Ambrose's son.

08:07.862 --> 08:11.232
- Oh, hello, Will. Delores.
- Nice to meet you, miss.

08:11.427 --> 08:14.811
Can I get you back to the house?
The movers are going to be here any minute.

08:14.911 --> 08:17.688
I hope to smell you again very soon.

08:17.788 --> 08:19.748
I hope so, too.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.009
Right this way, pops.

08:41.712 --> 08:43.881
- Knock, knock!
- Hello!

08:43.981 --> 08:45.091
Who's there?

08:45.191 --> 08:48.428
We are Crescent Bay's Welcoming Party,

08:48.928 --> 08:52.549
and, well, we just couldn't wait
to introduce ourselves to you!

08:53.149 --> 08:56.352
- I'm Emma.
- And I'm Gloria!

08:56.452 --> 09:00.339
- I'm Clarissa.
- Ambrose McKinley.

09:00.475 --> 09:03.025
Mr. McKinley, is there anything
we can do to help?

09:03.125 --> 09:04.751
No, thanks.

09:05.778 --> 09:07.383
- Did you bring cake?
- Yes.

09:07.483 --> 09:10.741
Yes we did!
And where would you like us to put it?

09:10.841 --> 09:13.035
I can't eat sugar, but thanks anyway.

09:16.138 --> 09:17.540
You were a veteran.

09:17.640 --> 09:22.003
I am a veteran, twenty years
United States Army. Five years Vietnam.

09:22.103 --> 09:25.506
Oh, my!
Oh, that's very impressive!

09:25.606 --> 09:28.316
Yeah? You didn't hear? We lost that one.

09:32.613 --> 09:36.267
Oh, there don't tend
to be firearms at Crescent Bay.

09:36.367 --> 09:38.296
That's nice.

09:39.620 --> 09:42.899
- I didn't think it was legal.
- What, for a blind person to own guns?

09:42.999 --> 09:44.567
- It's legal.
- Oh.

09:44.667 --> 09:47.487
Perhaps you were thinking of retards.

09:47.587 --> 09:51.115
Now, you just hold on
one minute, Mr. McKinley...

09:51.215 --> 09:53.409
You hold on one minute.
I'm a weapons expert.

09:53.509 --> 09:55.786
I know more about guns
than you do Pop-Tarts.

09:55.886 --> 09:58.330
So thank you for the sugar
and have a nice night.

10:01.826 --> 10:03.252
Well...

10:03.352 --> 10:06.846
Welcome to Crescent Bay, Mr. McKinley.

10:08.190 --> 10:09.475
Any help at all, Mr. McKinley...

10:09.575 --> 10:13.695
I'd see you ladies to the door,
but I'm blind.

10:25.291 --> 10:26.943
There we go.

10:27.043 --> 10:30.363
Are you a good doggie,
or are you a bad doggie?

10:30.463 --> 10:34.265
You're a good doggie... yes.

10:35.176 --> 10:38.412
That's my boy. Is that good?

10:38.512 --> 10:41.748
Is that good? Yes.

11:02.703 --> 11:04.412
Darn!

11:20.221 --> 11:25.084
Hey, mom, it's me. I just wanted to say
I'm sorry we missed the yard sale...

11:25.184 --> 11:27.235
Victoria! Are you there?

11:27.335 --> 11:29.463
Hi, Mom!
Didn't think you'd still be awake.

11:29.563 --> 11:32.842
I sure am!
Thank you for calling, sweetheart.

11:32.942 --> 11:35.967
But you actually said
you'd come help tomorrow.

11:36.067 --> 11:40.182
Are you sure?
I'm looking at my planner and...

11:40.282 --> 11:45.271
Oh, Mom, I'm so sorry.
Oh, God. I hope I didn't confuse you.

11:45.371 --> 11:47.940
I'm not the one who's confused,
Victoria.

11:48.040 --> 11:51.093
If I didn't remember these things
nobody else would.

11:51.193 --> 11:53.153
Mom, I'm sorry!
I've been all over the...

12:13.816 --> 12:16.359
Even I can see this ain't
the goddamn bedroom.

12:44.972 --> 12:46.890
What the hell is that?

12:50.060 --> 12:54.590
Mom, remember when we talked about changing
your outgoing answering machine message?

12:54.690 --> 12:57.968
It's just nice to hear
his voice, Victoria.

12:58.168 --> 13:01.914
I'd feel so much better
if you let us get you another dog.

13:02.014 --> 13:04.200
Just a little someone
to keep you company.

13:04.300 --> 13:07.520
There is no point in getting
dog after dog, sweetheart,

13:07.620 --> 13:09.397
if they're all going to run away.

13:09.497 --> 13:14.918
If a third dog runs away I'm going
to have to start taking it personally.

13:28.557 --> 13:31.435
Shadow! Where are you, boy?

13:31.535 --> 13:33.295
Anyway, mom,

13:34.234 --> 13:38.016
I'm going to have to go.
I have to put the little munchkins...

13:38.116 --> 13:41.095
Julie! Put that... put that down!

13:41.195 --> 13:43.097
Mom, I've got to put
the little ones to bed.

13:43.197 --> 13:47.351
Victoria, can you just stay
with me for a second?

13:47.451 --> 13:49.869
Can you stay on the line with me?

13:56.752 --> 13:58.169
Shadow.

14:01.006 --> 14:02.790
What is it, boy?

14:05.077 --> 14:07.246
What? Mom?

14:07.346 --> 14:10.332
Hello? Mom?

14:10.432 --> 14:12.016
Is everything okay?

14:48.137 --> 14:50.538
Delores! Delores!

14:57.646 --> 15:00.606
Delores! Delores!

15:02.276 --> 15:04.060
Delores!

15:08.991 --> 15:12.436
Hello, you've reached
Delores and Jonathan.

15:12.536 --> 15:17.107
Please leave us your name
and number and we'll...

15:17.207 --> 15:20.501
Delores! Delores!

15:22.421 --> 15:23.755
- Mom?
- Delores!

15:24.882 --> 15:27.717
- Delores!
- Mom?!

15:28.636 --> 15:31.129
Okay. Call me back.

15:57.915 --> 15:59.582
Shadow?

16:10.503 --> 16:12.762
What did I do with the guns?

16:15.891 --> 16:17.392
Shadow?

16:18.185 --> 16:19.777
Shadow?

16:23.023 --> 16:24.587
Shadow?

16:26.068 --> 16:27.944
It's me, boy. C'mon.

17:26.502 --> 17:28.020
Shadow?

17:31.016 --> 17:34.068
Shadow? Shadow?

17:43.062 --> 17:44.562
It's okay.

17:49.201 --> 17:51.102
Daddy's here.

17:54.990 --> 17:56.699
It's okay.

18:00.688 --> 18:02.622
Daddy's here, boy.

18:04.958 --> 18:07.126
Shadow.

18:27.731 --> 18:30.942
You know we wouldn't have to come back here
if you hadn't left early last night, right?

18:31.944 --> 18:33.661
You smell that?

18:34.738 --> 18:35.597
- No.
- Swear to God,

18:35.697 --> 18:38.892
I can smell this old folk smell
from all the way up here.

18:38.992 --> 18:40.728
- Really?
- It's following me.

18:40.828 --> 18:42.521
Why is it that they
don't smell the same?

18:42.621 --> 18:46.125
It's almost like, it's on their furniture,
it's on their clothes. I don't even know.

18:46.225 --> 18:49.428
- Is it something medical, you think?
- Dude. Not all old people smell like that.

18:49.528 --> 18:51.739
No, no, no! Old people do smell like that,
I'm telling you.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.615
I smell my grandfather like, every day.
I sleep with him.

18:53.715 --> 18:55.868
I've been sleeping with him
for ten years. In the same bed!

18:55.968 --> 18:57.661
I'm not even lying to you, man!
I'm serious.

18:57.761 --> 18:59.997
Yeah, just be glad
it's not patchouli, alright?

19:00.097 --> 19:03.525
You're lucky you were on vacation when we
had to move this guy from the north end.

19:04.476 --> 19:07.069
He had like twenty guitars that all...

19:09.690 --> 19:12.058
- Oh, man.
- Jesus!

19:29.710 --> 19:31.744
You alright, Mr. McKinley?

19:32.462 --> 19:34.714
Oh, fuck!

19:48.770 --> 19:50.922
Help me, please. My dog...

19:53.025 --> 19:57.603
Don! Don! Come over here, Don!
Get over here now!

20:01.158 --> 20:06.956
No. Yeah, I'm up here right now.
It happened some time last night.

20:07.656 --> 20:11.568
Well, I'm at least an hour
out of the city so...

20:11.668 --> 20:15.331
Look, I'll call you
as soon as I leave here, okay?

20:15.631 --> 20:17.315
Alright. Thank you.

20:17.591 --> 20:20.077
- Hey.
- Hi.

20:20.177 --> 20:21.662
- Was that work?
- Yeah.

20:21.762 --> 20:24.972
I'm catching hell
from missing this meeting.

20:27.434 --> 20:29.993
Will, did you seriously leave
your father alone in the new house

20:30.093 --> 20:33.298
without a working phone?
Honey, what were you thinking?

20:33.398 --> 20:37.686
I wasn't, okay? I've been
a little scattered... recently,

20:37.786 --> 20:41.056
and besides, I thought that the movers
took care of that sort of thing.

20:41.156 --> 20:44.802
You know, he was sitting at home
by himself until someone found him.

20:45.902 --> 20:47.813
How is he now?

20:47.913 --> 20:50.482
- You know what? I don't know.
- What do you mean?

20:50.582 --> 20:55.202
Well, his "okay" and his "not okay,"
they look exactly the same.

20:55.879 --> 20:57.613
Mr. McKinley.

20:59.383 --> 21:03.829
Do you have any idea
what attacked you and Shadow?

21:03.929 --> 21:06.040
No. Whatever it was, it was big.

21:06.640 --> 21:09.877
- Like a mountain lion? Or a bear?
- More like a dog.

21:09.977 --> 21:12.713
- You're sure?
- Yeah. I could smell it.

21:12.813 --> 21:16.758
- You've been in Crescent Bay a while?
- No. It's our first night.

21:16.858 --> 21:21.555
Mr. McKinley, we get phone calls
once a month about Crescent Bay.

21:21.655 --> 21:23.657
The police ask us what could do
something like this.

21:23.757 --> 21:25.309
It's actually a very common thing.

21:25.409 --> 21:28.187
Once a month?
This has happened before?

21:28.287 --> 21:32.024
It's a secluded community.
Town basically ends there.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.984
And the woods begin.

21:34.084 --> 21:36.320
Sometimes I'm surprised
it doesn't happen more often.

21:36.420 --> 21:39.323
It's a terrible location.
Even with the gates.

21:39.423 --> 21:42.034
What do you think, Doc?

21:42.134 --> 21:45.221
Does it look like a dog
did this to Shadow?

21:45.721 --> 21:47.763
In passing.

21:49.766 --> 21:51.298
Are you kidding me?

21:51.398 --> 21:54.004
The whole point that we came out here was
so that they were going to take the dog.

21:54.104 --> 21:56.692
We can't take that in my car.
It's a company car.

21:56.792 --> 21:59.468
- He was supposed to leave the dog here.
- Okay. Stop that, Will.

21:59.568 --> 22:03.347
Hi, Ambrose, I came straight from work.
I'm so glad you're okay.

22:03.447 --> 22:05.906
Anne, which car are we taking?

22:07.534 --> 22:10.896
Are we taking you
to take a new guide dog?

22:10.996 --> 22:13.565
No. I'm taking Shadow home.

22:13.665 --> 22:15.709
Dad... seriously?

22:15.809 --> 22:18.811
Yeah. I can take care of myself.
Now, which car are we taking?

22:26.053 --> 22:28.664
- Speed limit's twenty...
- I know it's twenty-five. I got it.

22:28.764 --> 22:30.222
Fine.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.458
There's a lot of cops here.

22:44.946 --> 22:47.808
Let me get you inside. I'll come back
and figure out what's going on.

22:47.908 --> 22:49.726
I want to see the cops.

22:49.826 --> 22:51.937
No. Let me get you
in the house first. Please, Dad.

22:52.037 --> 22:54.231
Just take care of the dog.
I'll see you in a minute.

22:54.331 --> 22:55.774
Please, Mrs. Kaye.

22:55.874 --> 22:58.151
You really don't
want to go in there, Mrs. Kaye.

22:58.251 --> 23:01.321
Let us take you down to the station
and finish your report there.

23:01.421 --> 23:04.449
Oh, for God's sake! How long
does it take you people to do your job?

23:04.549 --> 23:07.202
I just want to get this over with
and move on with my life, okay?

23:07.302 --> 23:09.327
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Are you alright, sir?

23:09.427 --> 23:11.540
Yeah. I was attacked last night.

23:11.640 --> 23:14.084
- Are you Mr. McKinley?
- Yeah.

23:14.184 --> 23:16.044
Excuse me for one second. Excuse me.

23:16.144 --> 23:17.688
Miss?

23:17.788 --> 23:20.189
- Yeah?
- Is Delores your mother?

23:21.650 --> 23:23.343
She was. Yes.

23:23.443 --> 23:27.454
Well, I'm sorry.
She seemed like a nice lady.

23:28.949 --> 23:30.724
Thank you.

23:32.477 --> 23:34.403
God, this place.

23:36.706 --> 23:40.336
I should have taken her out of here
the moment I heard the stories, but...

23:40.436 --> 23:44.407
there were so few options and I swear

23:44.707 --> 23:48.876
I never thought she'd... I'm sorry.

23:51.680 --> 23:54.207
You know the woman
who used to live here?

23:54.307 --> 23:57.544
I only met her once.
You guys need a statement from me?

23:57.644 --> 24:00.088
No, there's no need.
It's just an animal attack.

24:00.188 --> 24:03.008
You got any leads?
Suspect may have sharp teeth.

24:03.108 --> 24:05.135
Hey. Hey.

24:05.235 --> 24:10.182
Sir, attacks like these happen all the time
around wooded areas like this.

24:10.282 --> 24:13.393
The problem is the elderly
can't defend themselves.

24:13.493 --> 24:14.853
So we suggest during the day

24:14.953 --> 24:18.231
you don't walk by the perimeter
of the woods if you're alone.

24:18.331 --> 24:22.123
And at night, please, stay in your house,
keep the doors closed

24:22.223 --> 24:24.446
and the windows closed
until we sort this out. Okay?

24:24.546 --> 24:27.991
- Starting now.
- Gotcha.

24:28.091 --> 24:30.851
- Thanks for the piece of mind, boys!
- You're welcome.

24:31.887 --> 24:34.613
We need another hour at least
to clean up the rest of it.

24:41.605 --> 24:45.441
- Ambrose, I'm so sorry about Shadow.
- Yeah. It is a shame.

24:47.736 --> 24:51.640
It is a shame.
It seems like such a nice place to live.

24:51.740 --> 24:55.018
People don't come
to places like this to live.

24:55.118 --> 24:57.479
They come here to die.

24:57.779 --> 24:59.773
Yeah, well...

24:59.873 --> 25:03.151
Seems like everybody's been
having a crazy couple of days.

25:03.251 --> 25:05.278
Must be the full moon.

25:05.378 --> 25:08.881
Office is filled with a bunch
of nut jobs every time like clockwork.

25:10.967 --> 25:13.349
Hey, pops, have you eaten today?

25:13.778 --> 25:15.187
No.

25:16.056 --> 25:18.340
You've got to eat something.

25:29.361 --> 25:30.611
What is he doing?

25:40.972 --> 25:42.899
Pops, I...

25:42.999 --> 25:47.195
I checked the phone line about
a dozen times. It's working fine now.

25:47.295 --> 25:48.905
We can stay longer if you like.

25:49.005 --> 25:52.659
No, I'm fine.
Nothing's going to happen tonight.

25:52.759 --> 25:54.635
Is it a full moon?

25:56.555 --> 25:57.789
What?

25:57.889 --> 26:00.500
No, the full moon
was last night, Ambrose.

26:00.600 --> 26:02.820
So the next one's in a month.

26:07.482 --> 26:10.601
Yeah, that's pretty much
the way it works, Dad.

26:13.363 --> 26:15.489
One month.

26:28.211 --> 26:30.989
I'll call you tomorrow. Okay, Dad?

26:31.089 --> 26:33.215
Drive safe.

27:00.260 --> 27:02.194
One month.

27:03.513 --> 27:05.697
One month.

27:12.380 --> 27:14.616
I'm only here a week, I got mail?

27:14.716 --> 27:17.744
- Are you Kimberly Carty?
- Do I look like Kimberly Carty?

27:17.844 --> 27:19.442
Not particularly.

27:20.388 --> 27:23.667
- How'd you know I was the mailman?
- I'm not deaf.

27:23.767 --> 27:25.669
You want some chicken?

27:26.854 --> 27:31.800
No, thank you, sir.
Say, what happened here?

27:31.900 --> 27:35.470
- My dog got killed.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

27:35.570 --> 27:39.140
The blood. Where does it lead?

27:39.240 --> 27:42.660
- It goes out to the street.
- Show me.

27:58.259 --> 28:01.705
- Is this it?
- Yeah. 1202 Huntington.

28:01.805 --> 28:04.165
- Gloria and John Baker.
- Good.

28:04.265 --> 28:08.677
I got it from here, thanks. Just point me
in the right direction. Will ya?

28:10.271 --> 28:13.565
- Hey, are you going to be alright?
- Yeah, I'm going to be fine.

28:46.641 --> 28:50.103
Oh, my... Oh, my goodness.
Oh, Ambrose!

28:50.203 --> 28:53.489
What a pleasant surprise! Come in.

28:53.689 --> 28:56.509
Watch your step. Here. Good.

28:56.609 --> 28:59.054
- You're growing vegetables?
- Oh, yes!

28:59.154 --> 29:03.475
I want to apologize for my behavior.
I'm a little stressed with the move.

29:03.575 --> 29:07.270
Oh, yes. Well, sure. Just welcome!

29:07.370 --> 29:11.491
Welcome to our little part
of the world! John and I.

29:11.791 --> 29:13.978
I just gave him a haircut.

29:15.985 --> 29:19.949
My goodness. Why are you carrying
that shovel around?

29:20.049 --> 29:21.609
I've been digging.

29:23.344 --> 29:26.331
You walked all this way.
You must be thirsty.

29:26.431 --> 29:30.377
You know, I just made some sun tea.
I'll go get you a glass.

29:30.477 --> 29:32.269
Thank you.

30:24.405 --> 30:28.268
Stop! Ambrose! Oh! Oh, my god!

30:28.368 --> 30:30.812
You just about turned off
John's machine!

30:30.912 --> 30:32.897
I'm sorry.

30:32.997 --> 30:34.065
I didn't know what it was.

30:34.165 --> 30:38.027
It's alright. I know you
didn't mean it. Let's just go.

30:38.127 --> 30:41.748
- What's wrong with him?
- He's in an iron lung.

30:41.948 --> 30:44.082
Poor fucking bastard.

30:47.178 --> 30:49.831
I've actually got a lot of things
to do with John today, Ambrose.

30:49.931 --> 30:52.751
Any other day
you would be more than welcome.

30:52.851 --> 30:55.795
- I'm sorry about your husband.
- Oh, well.

30:55.895 --> 30:58.296
Does he ever get out of that thing?

30:59.065 --> 31:01.384
About as often as you blink,
Mr. McKinley.

31:01.484 --> 31:05.320
Yeah. Good luck with your vegetable.

31:10.994 --> 31:14.079
You won't believe what just happened.

31:26.009 --> 31:28.703
Hey! This is private property.

31:29.003 --> 31:32.123
Private property is the reason
we were called out here, Mr. McKinley.

31:32.223 --> 31:35.251
A couple people have called in complaints.
Feeling threatened.

31:35.351 --> 31:37.045
- We're the police, sir.
- Yeah.

31:37.145 --> 31:39.839
- I can smell the donuts.
- This is serious business.

31:39.939 --> 31:43.009
We've had two fatal attacks occur
within five blocks of each other.

31:43.109 --> 31:46.679
- Two?
- Yeah, we discovered another victim.

31:46.779 --> 31:50.642
Cole Evanston.
Lives about three blocks...

31:50.742 --> 31:51.810
North of here.

31:51.910 --> 31:54.629
Listen, sir. We get assigned
to patrol Crescent Bay daily.

31:54.729 --> 31:57.009
And a lot of the cranks that live here,
they throw fits, lose their minds

31:57.109 --> 31:59.484
and call in every little problem,
making them into our little problems.

31:59.584 --> 32:01.236
Since when is murder a little problem?

32:01.336 --> 32:04.280
They're animal attacks, sir.
Considered acts of God.

32:04.380 --> 32:08.203
And forgive me, but death at old age is not
on our list of this town's biggest problems.

32:08.343 --> 32:10.620
The only big problem
I'm sensing around here is you.

32:10.720 --> 32:13.665
So don't be a pain in the ass.
You wouldn't like me if I hated my job.

32:13.765 --> 32:16.918
You can always retire. This place is great!
Units opening up all the time!

32:17.018 --> 32:21.214
Sir, please. Please, just stick
to your own property, okay? Thank you.

32:21.314 --> 32:25.110
Hey! I found this in my mailbox.

32:25.610 --> 32:27.886
Can you tell me what it is?

32:29.822 --> 32:32.450
Oh! It's just a flyer
from the St. Anthony's church.

32:32.550 --> 32:35.929
They send a shuttle up here
every Sunday to get people down there.

32:36.829 --> 32:39.774
- You should consider going this Sunday.
- I'm not religious.

32:39.874 --> 32:43.278
Well, even so. You get out of the house,
you get to meet your neighbors.

32:43.378 --> 32:45.095
You might have a good time.

33:21.541 --> 33:25.210
- Morning, sir. You ready to go?
- I was born ready.

33:32.176 --> 33:34.394
I gotcha. Here you go.

33:38.249 --> 33:39.975
Thanks, James.

33:41.060 --> 33:45.965
I'm Father Roger Schmidt
from St. Anthony's.

33:46.065 --> 33:47.467
Who might you be?

33:47.567 --> 33:51.513
Ambrose McKinley.
United States Army. Retired.

33:51.946 --> 33:56.267
Glad to have you. Welcome.
To your left that's James Griffin.

33:56.367 --> 33:58.937
He's the one who organizes
the shuttle services.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.437
Welcome.

34:02.957 --> 34:04.901
You smoke?

34:05.001 --> 34:06.819
Yeah. Guilty.

34:06.919 --> 34:09.839
It's really hard to get the smell
out of your beard...

34:10.339 --> 34:14.551
- What about you?
- Used to. Had to quit. Doctor's orders.

34:17.054 --> 34:19.581
So I've never seen you
at Saint Anthony's before.

34:19.681 --> 34:22.384
- You just moved in, right?
- That's right.

34:26.647 --> 34:31.027
I live on Duke Street, myself.
Right over near the woods there.

34:31.527 --> 34:33.353
It's good to know you, neighbor.

34:36.282 --> 34:38.643
What gives with the shovel?

34:38.743 --> 34:40.920
I lost my cane.

34:41.020 --> 34:43.690
Well, maybe we can get one
donated to you?

34:43.790 --> 34:46.485
It's hardly worth it. Besides,

34:46.685 --> 34:49.416
I like the feel of this one.

35:28.626 --> 35:30.774
A lot of people.

35:31.796 --> 35:35.782
A lot of people

35:35.882 --> 35:38.912
when they hear the word
"sacrifice" think

35:39.012 --> 35:41.230
"I don't think that's so bad.

35:41.330 --> 35:44.292
I make sacrifices all the time."

35:44.392 --> 35:47.670
And they sacrifice their time
and they sacrifice their schedule.

35:47.770 --> 35:50.373
And their plans.

35:50.773 --> 35:54.219
And parents, in particular,

35:55.111 --> 35:58.806
make a life-long
occupation of sacrifice.

35:58.906 --> 36:04.003
And if they... And if they do it right,

36:05.538 --> 36:08.399
their children have no awareness

36:08.499 --> 36:12.028
of sacrifices that have
been made on their behalf.

36:12.128 --> 36:14.926
But it dawned on me

36:15.769 --> 36:20.288
that if sacrifice comes easily,

36:20.803 --> 36:24.040
if sacrifice comes naturally to you,

36:25.474 --> 36:28.676
you don't know the half of it.

36:35.193 --> 36:36.276
Richard.

36:50.416 --> 36:53.194
Why does he have to bring a shovel?

36:53.294 --> 36:57.422
Why is he bringing the shovel
into our church?

36:58.507 --> 37:00.491
Hey, Ambrose.

37:01.052 --> 37:04.187
- Follow my smoke trail?
- Yeah.

37:06.599 --> 37:08.693
Hey, I hope you don't...

37:10.083 --> 37:13.444
mind me gearing my sermon towards you.

37:13.544 --> 37:18.184
You said you were a vet
and it got me thinking about sacrifice.

37:20.404 --> 37:22.265
You were in 'Nam?

37:22.365 --> 37:23.923
Yeah.

37:24.533 --> 37:27.395
Hey, you got an extra fag?

37:27.495 --> 37:29.074
Oh, sure. Take mine.

37:31.082 --> 37:35.295
Because, my brother...
older brother... went over there.

37:35.795 --> 37:39.265
I was in the seminary
when he shipped out.

37:39.365 --> 37:41.357
When he came back...

37:41.457 --> 37:44.474
he came back... he came back screaming.

37:45.846 --> 37:48.716
And he still does it at night sometimes.

37:49.016 --> 37:50.668
I guess it's fear...

37:50.768 --> 37:53.440
No. He's angry.

37:54.939 --> 37:56.373
Yeah.

37:57.191 --> 37:58.843
Me?

37:58.943 --> 38:00.845
I come back with eye trauma.

38:00.945 --> 38:05.600
Kept getting worse, but...
I was too stubborn to ask for help.

38:05.700 --> 38:08.476
By the time I went blind I couldn't stand
to look at the world anyway.

38:11.730 --> 38:16.619
You mean, you think you deserved it
because you didn't ask for more help?

38:16.919 --> 38:18.678
Maybe.

38:19.864 --> 38:24.160
Well, because you said that you didn't think
it was worth you getting a cane.

38:24.260 --> 38:25.828
Canes are for cripples.

38:25.928 --> 38:29.765
Besides, I don't plan on
being around much longer anyway.

38:33.102 --> 38:35.930
I hope you're not talking about
what I think you're talking about.

38:36.230 --> 38:38.158
Because that's not an option.

38:38.858 --> 38:43.040
I will not participate
in that sort of giving in.

38:43.240 --> 38:47.106
Everybody dies, Father. Besides,

38:48.826 --> 38:50.985
some things are okay to quit.

38:53.372 --> 38:56.966
Mr. McKinley, Father.
The shuttle's getting ready to go.

39:04.467 --> 39:07.318
One, two,

39:08.802 --> 39:10.171
three,

39:10.271 --> 39:12.940
four, five.

39:30.935 --> 39:32.603
It's two weeks
and he's still doing this.

39:32.703 --> 39:34.355
Oh, god, that smell.

39:34.455 --> 39:37.165
I can't believe the neighbors
haven't complained about it.

39:40.586 --> 39:42.326
Six,

39:43.311 --> 39:45.056
seven.

39:48.594 --> 39:54.549
One, two, three, four, five,

39:57.686 --> 39:59.190
six...

40:12.910 --> 40:15.688
One, two, three.

40:15.788 --> 40:18.733
One, four, two, five, three, six.

40:18.833 --> 40:21.126
One, four, two...

40:28.426 --> 40:29.886
Mr. Griffin?

40:30.386 --> 40:35.191
I just want to say that we all really
appreciate what you're doing for us.

40:35.291 --> 40:36.792
Keeping the shuttle bus going.

40:36.892 --> 40:40.796
And we do believe that everyone

40:40.896 --> 40:43.966
should have a chance to hear God's word.

40:44.066 --> 40:48.387
But, I don't feel comfortable
having him on this bus.

40:48.487 --> 40:53.267
He tried to kill my husband and he
scratched up my floors with his shovel.

40:53.367 --> 40:56.788
I mean, I think he has a capacity for...

40:57.788 --> 40:59.357
- Violence.
- Yes!

40:59.457 --> 41:04.152
I'll talk to Father about it and see if I can
get an alternate vehicle or something.

41:04.753 --> 41:07.239
- Oh, thank you.
- Means a lot to us.

41:07.339 --> 41:10.572
- Thank you, Mr. Griffin.
- Please, just James.

41:23.839 --> 41:28.010
Four, five, five, seven,

41:28.110 --> 41:29.318
eight, nine.

42:16.325 --> 42:18.753
Seems to be a lot of new dogs
popping up in the area.

42:18.953 --> 42:21.730
Maybe we should start talking about
getting you a little Shadow Jr.

42:21.830 --> 42:23.673
No, thank you.

42:25.042 --> 42:27.653
How are you doing
on your blood pressure medicine?

42:27.753 --> 42:31.548
I've got a couple bottles left.
Fucking things make me constipated.

42:34.301 --> 42:36.162
You know, Ambrose, I was reading
about this thing online,

42:36.262 --> 42:38.597
this great new microwave
for the visually impaired.

42:38.697 --> 42:42.501
It actually reads the numbers out loud
as you're entering them.

42:42.601 --> 42:45.853
Jesus Christ,
I'm not that goddam lonely.

43:11.463 --> 43:13.623
I want this one.

43:15.801 --> 43:17.161
- Dad...
- Are you sure?

43:17.261 --> 43:20.122
That's a little pricier than some of
the ones we were looking at before.

43:20.222 --> 43:22.541
You don't have that much
money left. Okay?

43:22.641 --> 43:25.920
I mean, how can you justify
spending it all on a headstone?

43:26.020 --> 43:28.438
Because it's not for me.

43:29.940 --> 43:30.849
Okay!

43:34.361 --> 43:36.270
This should cover it.

43:37.031 --> 43:40.223
- Okay. Hey.
- What?

43:40.323 --> 43:43.612
- These are tens not hundreds!
- You're kidding.

43:43.912 --> 43:46.857
- Okay. It's just a joke.
- Real funny.

43:46.957 --> 43:48.734
Can I have this delivered to my house?

43:48.834 --> 43:52.905
Yep! I've got a guy. Take two days.

43:53.005 --> 43:54.699
As long as I have it in two weeks.

43:55.299 --> 43:58.268
- You got it.
- Is there a gun store around here?

44:01.263 --> 44:03.123
What you want a gun for, old man?

44:03.223 --> 44:06.267
Guns I got. I need ammo.

44:09.563 --> 44:12.132
I know a guy. Uptown.

44:12.232 --> 44:14.385
Westmark. That's the name of the shop.

44:14.485 --> 44:16.444
Can you write it down for me?

44:19.907 --> 44:21.683
Will,

44:23.388 --> 44:26.105
he still has all that cash with him.

44:26.205 --> 44:28.289
What if he loses it?

44:29.958 --> 44:32.486
Oh, shit. Pops! Hold on!

44:32.586 --> 44:34.045
What?

44:36.757 --> 44:38.742
- Pops.
- What?

44:38.842 --> 44:39.868
Hey.

44:39.968 --> 44:43.122
- What do you want?
- I need to get that cash from you.

44:43.222 --> 44:45.124
What for?

44:45.224 --> 44:48.127
I want to deposit it in a bank, okay?

44:48.227 --> 44:49.503
Why?

44:49.603 --> 44:52.463
Because it's not safe walking around
with your entire savings

44:52.563 --> 44:54.216
in your pocket like that.

44:54.316 --> 44:57.318
I can take care of myself.
What do I look like, an idiot?

44:58.779 --> 45:00.806
Would you please stop acting like this?

45:00.906 --> 45:04.143
Okay? I'm trying to help you. Alright?

45:04.243 --> 45:07.079
You're making it harder
and harder for me to do that.

45:07.179 --> 45:11.416
It's my money. I'm keeping it.
Stop acting like your mother.

45:45.951 --> 45:48.377
I don't want to argue
about it anymore, Will.

45:55.002 --> 45:57.318
I said, I didn't want to talk about it.

46:16.857 --> 46:18.675
I smell you, you son of a bitch.

47:13.413 --> 47:15.983
When are you going to bury
your dog, Mr. McKinley?

47:16.083 --> 47:18.636
Thinking about having him stuffed.

47:19.036 --> 47:21.155
Look, we can't get prints off a scarf.

47:21.355 --> 47:23.841
None of the neighbors
saw any sign of this assailant

47:23.941 --> 47:26.285
but he did kill a couple of dogs.

47:26.385 --> 47:28.620
But there's not witnesses.
Well, there was one.

47:28.720 --> 47:32.082
- But it was an Alzheimer's patient.
- You can smell the scarf though, right?

47:32.182 --> 47:36.319
- No, sir. Not over the smell of your dog.
- Smelled like smoke.

47:55.956 --> 47:57.474
What the fuck?

48:10.512 --> 48:13.916
Mr. McKinley! It's James Griffin.
I'll be your ride today.

48:14.016 --> 48:17.268
- Here, let me help you.
- I got it.

48:17.961 --> 48:20.296
I'm blind. I'm not crippled.

48:29.156 --> 48:32.059
So some of the neighbors thought the shuttle
might be a little cumbersome for you.

48:32.159 --> 48:34.019
So I was happy to volunteer.

48:34.119 --> 48:38.232
Lucky me. How long have you been
at Saint Anthony's?

48:38.332 --> 48:40.818
About twenty-five years now.

48:40.918 --> 48:43.362
You must know the priest pretty well?

48:43.462 --> 48:45.889
I suppose you could say that.

48:46.193 --> 48:48.826
- Not as well as he knows me though.
- Oh, yeah?

48:48.926 --> 48:52.579
Yeah, I owe my undying soul to that man.

48:52.679 --> 48:55.372
Seems a little strange to me.

48:56.350 --> 49:01.338
Father Roger is the least strange
person I know. Myself included.

49:01.438 --> 49:04.925
I can tell you he's been quite concerned
with you this past week.

49:05.025 --> 49:08.936
Oh, yeah? That's reassuring.

49:11.281 --> 49:14.184
You don't seem like a very
religious man, Mr. McKinley.

49:14.284 --> 49:16.520
I'm not. Just because you wear
a collar don't mean much.

49:16.620 --> 49:20.214
A man can get away with a lot
in uniform. Believe me.

49:23.961 --> 49:25.779
It's just... I don't know.

49:25.879 --> 49:29.116
I was just... it was funny
when you called, because it...

49:29.216 --> 49:32.010
You know, I went to high school with
your mother and you look just like her.

49:32.110 --> 49:33.787
- Isn't that amazing.
- It's really incredible.

49:33.887 --> 49:35.689
Hey, Father!

49:35.789 --> 49:38.045
Well, I've got to talk to this guy.
I'll talk to you again.

49:38.145 --> 49:41.251
- Okay, thank you.
- Yeah. Stay in touch.

49:46.066 --> 49:47.742
I owed you one.

49:49.638 --> 49:51.877
That's kind of you.

49:55.325 --> 49:58.652
I was very glad to see you
came back in this week.

50:00.205 --> 50:04.291
And, you know, it looked to me
like you were paying attention.

50:05.669 --> 50:09.672
When you're blind, it always
looks like you're paying attention.

50:11.049 --> 50:14.843
Yeah, well, what the hell were you
thinking about so intently for an hour?

50:15.345 --> 50:17.897
How you became a priest.

50:18.807 --> 50:21.835
It's funny how people don't ask that...

50:21.935 --> 50:23.891
question much anymore.

50:24.771 --> 50:27.697
I don't know, I was a bad kid and I...

50:28.259 --> 50:32.612
was mean and greedy
and stole and hurt a lot people.

50:32.712 --> 50:35.912
Then... I don't know, one day, you...

50:36.952 --> 50:41.612
you have to pick college or trade or...

50:41.712 --> 50:44.642
- The Army.
- Yeah.

50:45.042 --> 50:48.954
And I decided to go into the seminary.

50:49.254 --> 50:52.240
Go for the full transformation.

50:52.340 --> 50:55.369
It's sort of life and death, really.

50:55.469 --> 50:58.121
So you killed that bad part of yourself.

50:58.221 --> 51:02.843
Killed it? No.
You can't kill that thing.

51:03.043 --> 51:08.222
I guess I caged it and starved it and...

51:08.322 --> 51:10.895
and whittled it down to...

51:10.995 --> 51:12.818
a half pack a day.

51:14.863 --> 51:17.015
When I went to 'Nam,

51:17.115 --> 51:20.117
I honestly thought
I was going to save lives.

51:21.620 --> 51:24.205
Yeah, but you ended up taking them.

51:25.999 --> 51:30.903
My last tour, '68, Dien Phu Valley...

51:32.380 --> 51:34.283
The gooks,

51:35.008 --> 51:39.555
they strapped a grenade to a kid,
maybe six years old.

51:40.097 --> 51:42.431
And they sent him at us.

51:43.433 --> 51:45.676
Nobody would take the shot.

51:46.594 --> 51:48.387
I did.

51:52.359 --> 51:55.763
Is that what happened
to the "good side" of you?

51:56.363 --> 52:00.336
I might be blind, but when I close
my eyes I still see that kid's face.

52:02.202 --> 52:04.964
That moment was like a transformation.

52:05.705 --> 52:08.150
God don't want nothing
to do with me, Father.

52:08.250 --> 52:10.909
And I don't want nothing to do with him.

52:17.300 --> 52:20.102
Excuse me, Mr. McKinley,
we better get going.

52:23.440 --> 52:26.091
Talking about this felt good, didn't it?

52:27.269 --> 52:31.230
If you want to talk to me, Father,
you know where I live.

52:42.742 --> 52:45.202
So what did you and Father talk about?

52:46.329 --> 52:49.733
Not much. I don't think he is
who I thought he was.

52:50.333 --> 52:52.986
You ever see him act violent?

52:53.086 --> 52:55.030
What are you saying?

52:55.130 --> 52:58.133
I mean, he's a human being. He's just
another monkey like right of us. Come on.

52:58.233 --> 53:00.660
Look, you can disrespect the community,

53:00.760 --> 53:03.080
you can disrespect our neighbors,
you can disrespect me. I don't care.

53:03.180 --> 53:06.390
Do not disrespect that man. Do not...

53:29.122 --> 53:31.024
We're here.

53:31.224 --> 53:34.343
Yeah. Here we are.

53:50.435 --> 53:53.086
I wish I had that goddamn ammo.

54:12.207 --> 54:14.151
- Yeah?
- Hey.

54:14.251 --> 54:16.702
Is this the right address for the cross?

54:18.588 --> 54:21.116
You're late. Is it heavy?

54:21.216 --> 54:24.995
Yeah, it's fucking heavy. You want it inside
or you want it somewhere else?

54:25.095 --> 54:27.345
Bring it around back.

54:35.855 --> 54:37.709
Jesus.

54:38.024 --> 54:40.510
What's the rest of your day
look like, Chief?

54:40.610 --> 54:41.553
I dunno.

54:41.653 --> 54:44.529
You mind giving a old man
a ride into town?

55:02.257 --> 55:03.575
Afternoon.

55:03.675 --> 55:06.737
O'Brien sent me. You Westmark?

55:07.137 --> 55:12.261
If I'm not then he should be grateful
that I'm paying all his bills.

55:12.559 --> 55:14.426
Come on in.

55:15.186 --> 55:19.341
Watch your step here,
it's a little uneven.

55:19.441 --> 55:21.384
What can I do for ya?

55:21.484 --> 55:25.639
Do me a favor. I don't need no wisecracks,
no questions. You good with that?

55:25.739 --> 55:29.267
Hell, yeah, I'm good with that.
What do you need?

55:29.367 --> 55:32.562
Berreta's? M16's?

55:32.662 --> 55:36.775
Uzi. You're an Uzi guy.
Come in here. Come in my office.

55:36.875 --> 55:39.993
Watch your step right here. There it is.

55:40.587 --> 55:42.838
What can I do for ya?

55:43.757 --> 55:46.050
Can you make silver bullets?

55:48.646 --> 55:51.890
Yeah. I can make silver bullets.

55:52.390 --> 55:53.375
What guns?

55:53.475 --> 55:56.892
Smith and Wesson 64 revolver,
Remington 700 BDL rifle.

55:58.188 --> 56:02.001
- Yeah, I can make those.
- Can you do silver shotgun shells?

56:02.901 --> 56:04.636
Shotgun shells? Well...

56:04.736 --> 56:07.681
Shotgun shells
are a little more complicated.

56:07.781 --> 56:12.601
- They take like an hour to make.
- I only need one. I'll take it.

56:13.912 --> 56:15.516
Hey.

56:16.790 --> 56:19.250
What do silver bullets
make you think of?

56:19.350 --> 56:21.787
Me? The Lone Ranger.

56:22.087 --> 56:24.072
You ever see that?

56:24.172 --> 56:27.859
Vigilante, fighting for
justice and all that.

56:28.259 --> 56:32.539
He used silver bullets,
something about how the precious metal

56:32.639 --> 56:34.666
stood for the preciousness of life.

56:34.766 --> 56:37.043
The only thing precious
about life is that it ends.

56:37.143 --> 56:39.386
I heard that, brother!

56:40.897 --> 56:44.366
Anybody else ever come in here?
Asking for these?

56:46.236 --> 56:49.806
Only guy I can remember,
come in about a year ago.

56:49.906 --> 56:51.641
Do you mind if I ask who?

56:51.741 --> 56:53.601
Nah.

56:53.701 --> 56:55.596
I got to look.

56:55.940 --> 56:59.531
My memory is not what it used to be.

57:01.501 --> 57:03.870
Let me see here...

57:04.170 --> 57:06.630
Oh, yeah! Here it is. His name was...

59:29.382 --> 59:30.991
Thanks.

59:31.317 --> 59:32.901
Take care.

01:00:20.216 --> 01:00:22.374
I'm sorry.

01:00:22.844 --> 01:00:25.037
I'm sorry for everything.

01:00:44.307 --> 01:00:47.085
Dad! Dad! Dad! Jesus Christ!

01:00:47.185 --> 01:00:49.712
It's Will! Put the fucking gun down!

01:00:49.812 --> 01:00:51.965
What the fuck are you doing here?

01:00:52.065 --> 01:00:56.309
I came here to check up on you, man.
You almost shot me, Dad!

01:00:58.696 --> 01:01:02.482
What has gotten into you?
What have you done to this place?

01:01:04.327 --> 01:01:08.413
What are you doing with this house?
Why are you sitting in the closet with a gun?

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.001
It's a system.

01:01:19.884 --> 01:01:22.210
It's your system?

01:01:23.471 --> 01:01:26.933
This house, I mean,
it's a complete mess.

01:01:27.033 --> 01:01:30.387
You've only been living here
for a month, Dad.

01:01:30.687 --> 01:01:32.302
Tomorrow will be a month.

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:43.573
What do you want, Will?

01:01:47.578 --> 01:01:49.131
Anne's pregnant, Dad.

01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:53.275
Good.

01:02:01.217 --> 01:02:04.469
Look, I came here to tell you that...

01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:09.558
She wants to have the baby
closer to her family.

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:15.105
So we're moving, pops.

01:02:18.943 --> 01:02:21.445
I'm happy for you, Will.

01:02:23.656 --> 01:02:25.407
Are you?

01:02:26.492 --> 01:02:28.645
What do you want from me?

01:02:28.745 --> 01:02:32.231
Hugs and kisses? Go live your life.

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:37.217
You know what...

01:02:38.254 --> 01:02:42.301
You know what I want from you?
How about the truth?

01:02:43.217 --> 01:02:44.528
You know what that is?

01:02:45.511 --> 01:02:49.799
I think you know exactly what that is.

01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:53.779
I found that when I was
cleaning up your house.

01:02:54.479 --> 01:02:59.050
Now you told me you threw that
in my mother's casket when she died.

01:02:59.150 --> 01:03:01.015
Why?

01:03:01.652 --> 01:03:07.115
Why'd you tell me that?
Why did you lie to your son?

01:03:09.535 --> 01:03:10.895
It's got nothing to do with you, Will.

01:03:10.995 --> 01:03:15.867
No. No, that's a lie too.
It's got everything to do with me.

01:03:21.756 --> 01:03:25.413
You know what, Dad.
If you ever need anything from me,

01:03:26.669 --> 01:03:30.547
don't come calling 'cause
I'm going to go live my own life.

01:03:39.357 --> 01:03:41.065
Will...

01:03:54.539 --> 01:03:57.908
Richard? Richard? Wake up!

01:03:58.008 --> 01:04:01.027
- What?
- I think there's someone inside.

01:04:10.997 --> 01:04:13.390
Oh! Richard...

01:04:16.936 --> 01:04:18.803
Mr. Griffin?

01:04:23.276 --> 01:04:25.242
Mr. Griffin...

01:04:25.442 --> 01:04:28.556
- Should I call the police?
- No! No, no.

01:04:28.656 --> 01:04:32.102
- Are you alright?
- Clarissa, Richard...

01:04:33.002 --> 01:04:36.314
What are you doing here?
James? Do you know where you are?

01:04:36.414 --> 01:04:39.776
Will you kneel with me? Will you
pray with me? Just for a moment.

01:04:39.876 --> 01:04:43.154
Hey, look. What is this?
It's the middle of night!

01:04:43.254 --> 01:04:44.822
Richard...

01:04:44.922 --> 01:04:49.118
Yes. Yes, James, we will pray.
We will pray.

01:04:49.218 --> 01:04:50.982
Lord,

01:04:52.393 --> 01:04:55.411
make me an instrument of Your peace.

01:04:56.475 --> 01:04:59.169
Where there is hatred,

01:04:59.731 --> 01:05:02.059
let me sow love.

01:05:02.273 --> 01:05:04.477
Where there is injury,

01:05:05.359 --> 01:05:07.279
pardon.

01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:10.139
Where there is doubt, faith,

01:05:10.239 --> 01:05:13.109
and where there is despair, hope.

01:05:13.409 --> 01:05:15.895
Where there is darkness, light.

01:05:15.995 --> 01:05:20.037
And where there is sadness, joy.

01:05:21.083 --> 01:05:22.945
Lord...

01:05:23.876 --> 01:05:26.843
Lord let me seek not to be consoled

01:05:27.423 --> 01:05:29.575
but to console.

01:05:29.675 --> 01:05:32.790
Let me seek not to be understood

01:05:33.179 --> 01:05:34.906
but to understand.

01:05:35.306 --> 01:05:38.084
Let me seek not be loved

01:05:38.184 --> 01:05:40.438
but to love.

01:05:40.738 --> 01:05:44.048
For it is in giving that we receive.

01:05:44.148 --> 01:05:47.467
And it is in dying
that we are born to eternal life.

01:06:10.675 --> 01:06:14.287
Mr. Griffin! Hello?

01:06:14.387 --> 01:06:17.936
- It's meals on wheels!
- Knock it off, Lang.

01:06:18.449 --> 01:06:21.685
- You think he's gone?
- I don't know.

01:06:32.238 --> 01:06:35.933
What a pleasant surprise, Mr. Griffin!
What brings you to my door?

01:06:36.033 --> 01:06:38.361
Please, Emma, call me James.

01:06:38.661 --> 01:06:39.519
I...

01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:43.921
I need your help.

01:06:46.419 --> 01:06:48.988
May I have your hand, please?

01:06:51.507 --> 01:06:53.109
Alright.

01:06:53.509 --> 01:06:56.663
Emma, you know I've always been
quite fond of you.

01:06:57.263 --> 01:06:58.930
And,

01:06:59.188 --> 01:07:04.003
please understand, I would never
do this if I didn't need the help.

01:07:05.702 --> 01:07:06.813
What are you...

01:07:26.275 --> 01:07:29.353
- I thought I smelled smoke.
- Yeah, I'm still working on that.

01:07:33.549 --> 01:07:36.243
- Is this a good time, Ambrose?
- Yeah.

01:07:36.343 --> 01:07:38.378
You got an extra cigarette?

01:07:45.603 --> 01:07:48.765
What's with the hole in the lawn?

01:07:49.065 --> 01:07:50.897
My dog.

01:07:51.609 --> 01:07:53.928
That's a big cross for a dog.

01:07:54.028 --> 01:07:56.062
It was a big dog.

01:07:59.075 --> 01:08:01.560
I came out here today
to visit one of your neighbors

01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:06.148
but I wanted to stop by because
I didn't like the way our last talk ended.

01:08:06.248 --> 01:08:07.817
Well...

01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:10.468
Wasn't exactly a happy topic.

01:08:13.297 --> 01:08:18.160
Yeah, well. I got to thinking you don't
have a lot of happy topics in your life.

01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:20.895
Yeah, at this point what can I expect?

01:08:23.182 --> 01:08:26.210
You've got stories.
You have wisdom. You...

01:08:26.310 --> 01:08:31.339
You're a deep guy, Ambrose. I mean, you still
see a bigger picture than most people.

01:08:34.151 --> 01:08:38.085
All I got left, Father,
are consequences.

01:08:38.738 --> 01:08:41.434
Okay, you're a loner,
either by choice or by nature.

01:08:41.533 --> 01:08:45.654
But no one can be truly alone.
So stop trying.

01:08:46.255 --> 01:08:49.707
It's a little late in my game
for advice, but thanks.

01:08:52.502 --> 01:08:55.406
You wanted to save lives
a long time ago, right?

01:08:55.506 --> 01:08:57.008
Yeah.

01:08:57.508 --> 01:08:59.667
A long time ago.

01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:02.747
Yeah, well,

01:09:02.947 --> 01:09:06.133
it's never too late to save your own.

01:09:06.433 --> 01:09:07.711
You hear me?

01:09:09.395 --> 01:09:11.581
I'm pointing at you.

01:09:15.901 --> 01:09:17.752
I hear ya.

01:09:35.154 --> 01:09:37.421
"Visiting a neighbor..." Shit!

01:10:26.430 --> 01:10:28.374
Oh, James. No!

01:10:28.474 --> 01:10:30.334
You made it!

01:10:30.434 --> 01:10:34.046
We talked about this and you promised.

01:10:34.146 --> 01:10:37.967
Whatever you think this medieval business
accomplishes, it simply doesn't.

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:41.512
It's corporal mortification, Father.
Acts of contrition.

01:10:41.612 --> 01:10:43.881
I chastise my body
and bring it into subjection.

01:10:43.981 --> 01:10:47.143
Did you... I gave you prayers.
Did you use them? And the rosaries?

01:10:47.243 --> 01:10:49.402
I tried those. Didn't work.

01:10:53.123 --> 01:10:54.917
What do you mean
that you cannot find him?

01:10:55.017 --> 01:10:58.904
You are the police!
I mean, he's an old man!

01:10:59.004 --> 01:11:01.991
Let me tell you something, he attacked
both me and my neighbors in our own home.

01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:04.735
I am lucky to be alive!

01:11:05.598 --> 01:11:08.971
God, this neighborhood has gone to pot.

01:11:15.771 --> 01:11:18.114
It's tonight already, Father.

01:11:20.776 --> 01:11:22.887
Will you sit down here?
I'll take care of your cuts.

01:11:22.987 --> 01:11:24.281
I've done everything.
Everything this week.

01:11:24.381 --> 01:11:26.599
Everything you said.
I turned to you and you gave me shit!

01:11:26.699 --> 01:11:30.261
I took your confession and I gave you
what you need to come back to light.

01:11:30.661 --> 01:11:34.740
This necklace? Prayers?
It's Sunday school garbage.

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:37.276
You gave me nothing
because you never believed me!

01:11:37.376 --> 01:11:41.488
I believe that you think
that you are possessed by an evil.

01:11:41.588 --> 01:11:43.574
But have you killed any more dogs?

01:11:43.674 --> 01:11:46.711
They wouldn't stop barking at me!
I swear to God they're barking in my head!

01:11:47.511 --> 01:11:50.630
Father, I need absolution.
I need it before it's too late.

01:11:56.879 --> 01:11:57.746
James...

01:11:58.731 --> 01:12:01.460
When I moved here, no one believed me.

01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:04.637
I hunted the beast.
I went in the woods and I killed it.

01:12:04.737 --> 01:12:08.933
But it got to me first. I have tried
everything and nothing works.

01:12:09.033 --> 01:12:14.142
All I want to do is live and worship
and kill in solitude and die in peace!

01:12:14.242 --> 01:12:16.857
- No more killing, James. No more killing.
- You have to!

01:12:16.957 --> 01:12:19.151
You have to kill what you attack.

01:12:19.251 --> 01:12:23.155
If you draw blood and you
leave it alive it carries over,

01:12:23.255 --> 01:12:26.075
- it transforms with you.
- You're making all this up.

01:12:26.175 --> 01:12:27.893
No, I'm telling you this
because I want you to know

01:12:27.993 --> 01:12:31.185
that when I kill you it's out of love.

01:12:31.285 --> 01:12:33.723
It's an act of mercy.

01:13:25.317 --> 01:13:26.934
Son of a bitch.

01:15:51.338 --> 01:15:52.618
Mrs. Baker?

01:15:57.970 --> 01:16:00.254
It's Ambrose McKinley.

01:16:04.434 --> 01:16:06.552
Is everything alright?

01:16:38.668 --> 01:16:40.586
I know that perfume, you bitch.

01:17:18.842 --> 01:17:22.494
Will, pick up the fucking phone.

01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:28.893
Will,

01:17:30.145 --> 01:17:32.263
it's your old man.

01:17:34.149 --> 01:17:37.159
I don't want to leave it
like this between us.

01:17:40.947 --> 01:17:43.524
I got something I need to tell you.

01:18:58.316 --> 01:18:59.799
Oh, shit.

01:19:03.447 --> 01:19:04.889
Shit!

01:20:24.886 --> 01:20:27.204
Here comes the welcoming party.

01:21:20.717 --> 01:21:22.543
Oh, fuck.

01:21:56.394 --> 01:21:58.037
Fuck!

01:22:10.617 --> 01:22:12.187
Oh, fuck.

01:23:12.570 --> 01:23:14.238
Griffin...

01:23:26.051 --> 01:23:27.819
Oh, come on.

01:23:27.919 --> 01:23:30.180
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:32.072
Oh, shit.

01:23:47.981 --> 01:23:49.674
Come on.

01:23:50.258 --> 01:23:52.369
Come on, Dad! Pick up your phone!

01:24:01.703 --> 01:24:03.796
Come on, Dad, pick up your phone!

01:24:14.132 --> 01:24:15.632
Fuck.

01:24:23.016 --> 01:24:27.235
One, two, three, four.

01:26:19.424 --> 01:26:21.300
I'm done.

01:26:39.402 --> 01:26:42.687
Oh, my God. Hey.

01:26:57.337 --> 01:26:58.997
Dad.

01:26:59.397 --> 01:27:01.156
Dad!

01:28:25.425 --> 01:28:27.190
Will.

01:28:27.427 --> 01:28:29.746
It's your old man.

01:28:29.846 --> 01:28:32.373
I don't want to leave
it like this between us.

01:28:32.473 --> 01:28:35.087
I got something I need to tell you.

01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:38.880
I know I wasn't the father
you needed me to be.

01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:41.674
I wasn't a good husband to your mother.

01:28:41.774 --> 01:28:43.927
You both deserve better.

01:28:44.027 --> 01:28:47.513
When you were born it was
the happiest day of my life.

01:28:47.613 --> 01:28:51.927
You don't remember but those
were good years for all of us.

01:28:52.327 --> 01:28:54.979
When they told me I was going blind,

01:28:55.079 --> 01:28:58.424
there was a black thing inside me
that shut out the light.

01:28:58.524 --> 01:29:00.883
Including you and your mother.

01:29:01.627 --> 01:29:06.699
I left because I didn't want it
touching you or her, but I was wrong.

01:29:06.799 --> 01:29:08.326
I know that now.

01:29:08.426 --> 01:29:12.413
I wasn't just blind in my eyes,
I was blind in my heart.

01:29:12.597 --> 01:29:16.042
The only thing I was good at
was being a soldier.

01:29:16.142 --> 01:29:19.295
That's what I am
and that's how I'm going out.

01:29:19.395 --> 01:29:22.474
Remember me, son,
for that and nothing else.

01:29:22.774 --> 01:29:27.220
I'm proud to be your father and I'm sorry
I won't get to see my grandkids.

01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:30.056
You have a good woman
and a future in front of you.

01:29:30.156 --> 01:29:33.017
Don't look back. That was my mistake.

01:29:33.117 --> 01:29:35.478
You can't live in the past.

01:29:35.578 --> 01:29:37.647
You've got to put it away
and move forward.

01:29:37.747 --> 01:29:40.692
Life's a gift.
Don't waste it like I did.

01:29:40.792 --> 01:29:44.654
Give my love to Anne
and be the man I couldn't be.

01:29:44.754 --> 01:29:47.922
I love you, boy. I always have.

01:29:49.092 --> 01:29:51.383
Okay. Goodbye, son.
