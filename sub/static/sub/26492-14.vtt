00:00.016 --> 00:01.366
<i>Previously on</i> Riverdale...

00:01.386 --> 00:03.116
<i>I burned your drugs
and equipment.</i>

00:03.196 --> 00:05.366
You owe me $75,000, Veronica.

00:05.446 --> 00:08.666
Now my buyer is coming,
and they are gonna want blood.

00:08.736 --> 00:11.706
- Here's your money.
- Then we'll figure out a payment plan for the rest.

00:11.716 --> 00:13.376
- What's this?
- A gang.

00:13.386 --> 00:15.336
The Pretty Poisons.

00:15.666 --> 00:18.256
Is this gang mine, or yours?

00:18.336 --> 00:20.546
It's... yours.

00:20.626 --> 00:22.256
Start by quitting the speakeasy.

00:22.336 --> 00:24.926
Forget about protecting
Lodge's daughter.

00:25.006 --> 00:28.306
If you don't get your house in order,
the Serpents' little piece in the pie

00:28.316 --> 00:30.436
is gonna get smaller.
You need numbers.

00:30.446 --> 00:33.476
Are you Kurtz?
If you and your Gargoyles join my gang,

00:33.486 --> 00:36.276
I can promise you immunity
from the sheriff's office.

00:36.346 --> 00:38.656
You are all just sacrifices
waiting to be made.

00:38.736 --> 00:41.446
This symbol the Warden branded on
Archie's hip, what does it mean?

00:41.526 --> 00:42.476
Sacrifice.

00:42.556 --> 00:44.076
It meant that Archie had to die.

00:44.146 --> 00:46.576
Gargoyles aren't the answer.
I don't want 'em anywhere near us.

00:46.656 --> 00:48.486
I did what you couldn't.

00:48.566 --> 00:51.006
- This is a bad idea. -I know you guys
will find a way to work together.

00:51.086 --> 00:53.626
<i>After what happened with
Moose, and him leaving town,</i>

00:53.696 --> 00:55.246
<i>Evelyn started talking to me.</i>

00:55.316 --> 00:57.846
Tell me you're not thinking
about actually joining the Farm.

00:57.926 --> 01:02.136
We are gathered here tonight to
celebrate the baptizing of Alice Smith.

01:02.206 --> 01:03.796
They tried to kill you, Mom.

01:03.876 --> 01:07.476
No, I saw it. My destiny.
I'm gonna sell this house.

01:07.546 --> 01:09.236
We're gonna all be together.

01:17.726 --> 01:19.326
<i>Mid century colonial,</i>

01:20.916 --> 01:23.166
<i>on a quite elm-lined street.</i>

01:24.786 --> 01:26.336
<i>Three bedrooms, four baths.</i>

01:27.236 --> 01:29.656
<i>Perfect for families.</i>

01:29.736 --> 01:32.176
<i>Plenty of storage,
and generous closet space...</i>

01:33.546 --> 01:36.376
Welcome. I'm Alice Smith.

01:36.386 --> 01:38.376
Come in.

01:38.386 --> 01:40.556
<i>...you will be happy here.</i>

01:40.636 --> 01:45.176
<i>♪ I'm gonna
spend my life, honey ♪</i>

01:45.256 --> 01:49.016
First off, I'd like to say that this
is a wonderful place to raise a family.

01:49.026 --> 01:52.346
Many a fort were built by my
two girls in this very room.

01:52.426 --> 01:54.216
And bonus.

01:54.296 --> 01:57.076
It's also where my serial killer
father showed us creepy snuff films.

01:57.146 --> 01:59.896
Elizabeth,
shouldn't you be at school?

01:59.906 --> 02:02.566
We have wonderful schools
in this district.

02:02.576 --> 02:04.366
Oh, I see that you're eyeing
the fireplace,

02:04.436 --> 02:05.696
which is original to the house.

02:05.776 --> 02:07.696
Yes, and comes with
fun accessories, like

02:07.776 --> 02:10.666
the shovel my mother used
to knock out my father.

02:10.746 --> 02:12.536
The notorious serial killer.

02:12.616 --> 02:13.576
The Black Hood.

02:13.656 --> 02:15.176
It's true, you can google it.

02:15.246 --> 02:18.876
But make sure you look up Alice
Cooper, and not Alice Smith.

02:18.956 --> 02:21.716
It's all there.
Or try murder house on Elm Street.

02:21.786 --> 02:23.846
It's this house.

02:29.626 --> 02:31.886
Don't they got a gym
at your school?

02:31.966 --> 02:33.886
Is there a problem, Mo?

02:33.966 --> 02:34.896
Yeah.

02:36.276 --> 02:37.656
I need you to start paying dues.

02:39.306 --> 02:40.366
Yeah. No, I get that.

02:41.976 --> 02:44.236
- It's just that...
- Or, you could...

02:44.316 --> 02:46.406
Help out here.
Sweep the place up.

02:46.476 --> 02:48.126
Take the trash out,

02:48.196 --> 02:50.616
- lock up at night.
- Yeah.

02:50.696 --> 02:52.586
That sounds great.
Thank you, Mo.

02:54.000 --> 03:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here

03:03.786 --> 03:06.756
Um... Excuse us.

03:06.836 --> 03:08.886
Sorry to interrupt your game...

03:08.956 --> 03:11.716
But this room is reserved for the Farm
from 3:00 to 4:00 every Wednesday.

03:11.796 --> 03:14.896
Not every Wednesday,
you daughter of Manson.

03:14.976 --> 03:16.316
The third Wednesday
of every month is reserved

03:16.396 --> 03:20.226
for monthly Student
Council/LGBTQIA meetings.

03:20.306 --> 03:23.106
I didn't see your name on
Mrs. Bell's activity calendar.

03:23.186 --> 03:26.566
You dare lecture me, your Student Council
President on rules and procedures?

03:26.646 --> 03:29.286
If this were the 18th century,
I'd have you beheaded.

03:29.366 --> 03:31.616
Hey, bitches,

03:31.696 --> 03:33.746
we're in the middle of
a quest here.

03:33.816 --> 03:37.296
Go crawl back to the freak show
from whence you came, you abomination.

03:47.346 --> 03:48.996
Hey, what the hell's going on
over there?

03:48.996 --> 03:51.186
The Gargoyles are mixing it up
with the Poisons and the Farmies.

03:53.046 --> 03:56.356
Is this a high school
or a Roger Cormen movie?

03:57.716 --> 03:59.936
What do you two
have to say for yourselves?

04:00.016 --> 04:02.146
The fight had already started
when we got there, sir.

04:02.226 --> 04:03.936
We were trying to break up
the fight.

04:04.016 --> 04:07.486
Mr. Jones, Ms. Topaz, you're the
leaders of your respective gangs,

04:07.496 --> 04:12.126
but today's brawl is only the most recent
incident of gang activity at Riverdale High.

04:12.196 --> 04:14.336
Someone robbed
the Chemistry lab last night.

04:16.236 --> 04:20.216
- Someone robbed the lab?
- Thousands of dollars of equipment was taken.

04:20.286 --> 04:22.496
All of which could be used
to cook drugs.

04:22.576 --> 04:25.336
The Serpents
don't cook, or steal.

04:25.416 --> 04:27.056
Neither do the Pretty Poisons.

04:30.396 --> 04:32.186
One more strike.

04:33.216 --> 04:34.356
One more strike!

04:36.216 --> 04:38.356
And you're done in my school.

04:40.056 --> 04:42.856
Ooh! All good, boss?

04:42.926 --> 04:44.156
Need me to bounce someone?

04:45.746 --> 04:47.866
Would that it were
so simple, Reggie.

04:49.476 --> 04:51.736
<i>Mija,</i> my guests
would like another round.

04:51.746 --> 04:53.196
Big night for you fellas, huh?

04:53.276 --> 04:55.156
Yeah, important
prospective clients

04:55.166 --> 04:57.196
need to be properly courted.

04:57.206 --> 05:00.086
I see. So, should I be putting all
this on your American Excess, Daddy?

05:00.166 --> 05:02.756
What are you talking about?
These are comped, of course.

05:02.836 --> 05:05.756
Daddy, you've been here for hours.
This is a huge bill.

05:05.836 --> 05:07.296
And you owe me a huge debt.

05:07.366 --> 05:08.516
So, again...

05:09.266 --> 05:10.726
This is comped.

05:15.216 --> 05:16.896
Reggie, man the bar.

05:19.346 --> 05:21.936
How the hell
did we get here, Reggie?

05:21.946 --> 05:25.726
Gladys and my dad are running
roughshod over La Bonne Nuit.

05:25.806 --> 05:30.196
And I don't have any leverage because
I owe them both so much money.

05:30.266 --> 05:34.576
And literally every dollar we make
is going straight into their pockets.

05:34.646 --> 05:36.376
We need a line
on a new cash cow.

05:37.456 --> 05:39.456
Wait. There was one night

05:39.536 --> 05:43.966
when we raked in exponentially
more money than every other night.

05:44.046 --> 05:45.466
The casino night we hosted
with Elio.

05:45.546 --> 05:49.126
- A casino?
- We'd be able to pay off our debts in weeks.

05:49.136 --> 05:50.256
Instead of years.

05:50.326 --> 05:51.926
You think we can pull that off?

05:51.936 --> 05:56.186
I mean, we're already running
a secret speak easy, Reggie.

05:56.886 --> 05:58.356
- Right?
- Right.

06:14.326 --> 06:17.576
What'd they do?
Make you manager?

06:17.646 --> 06:19.286
No, more like janitor.

06:19.356 --> 06:21.056
I'm almost done.

06:21.066 --> 06:22.786
I was thinking maybe we could
grab a bite at Pop's or something?

06:22.866 --> 06:24.676
Perfect. I'm starving.

06:26.846 --> 06:27.966
What is that?

06:45.056 --> 06:46.236
Oh, my God.

06:48.696 --> 06:50.356
What the hell are you
doing in here? Who are you?

06:50.366 --> 06:52.696
Archie, take it easy.

06:52.766 --> 06:55.446
Hey. What's your name?

06:55.516 --> 06:57.626
- Ricky.
- Ricky.

06:58.876 --> 07:01.336
Are... Are you hungry?

07:03.236 --> 07:04.416
Starving.

07:09.296 --> 07:11.876
Uh, so, Ricky...

07:11.886 --> 07:13.546
Where are your parents?

07:13.556 --> 07:16.676
Don't know. Never knew 'em.

07:16.686 --> 07:18.346
How long you been holing up
in that cubby?

07:18.416 --> 07:20.686
On and off for a few weeks.

07:20.766 --> 07:24.806
Ricky, is there anyone
we should call? Any family?

07:24.886 --> 07:26.696
No, I don't have anybody.

07:27.976 --> 07:30.016
Maybe we should try Betty.

07:30.096 --> 07:32.826
She knows people at Social Services.
They would know...

07:33.936 --> 07:36.246
Hey. Ricky! Ricky.

07:36.986 --> 07:39.366
Hey. What's going on?

07:39.436 --> 07:41.736
You... You can't call
Social Services.

07:41.816 --> 07:43.246
- Okay.
- Why not?

07:43.326 --> 07:46.416
Because they send me
to this place, a shelter, okay?

07:46.496 --> 07:47.536
I don't wanna go back.

07:47.616 --> 07:49.626
Okay, what shelter?

07:49.696 --> 07:52.376
The Santa Lucia Shelter.

07:52.456 --> 07:53.926
Did they do something
to you there?

08:01.966 --> 08:03.676
That is the same brand...

08:03.756 --> 08:05.476
I got at Leopold and Loeb, yeah.

08:09.466 --> 08:11.056
All right, Ricky,
who gave you that?

08:11.136 --> 08:12.616
Some older guys at the shelter.

08:12.686 --> 08:14.736
They didn't live there,
but they did crash there, and

08:14.806 --> 08:19.866
one night I woke up, and they were
holding me down and branding my arm.

08:19.936 --> 08:21.916
And that's when
I left the shelter.

08:31.636 --> 08:33.626
All right, heater's on.

08:33.706 --> 08:35.836
Here's some extra blankets
if you get cold.

08:35.916 --> 08:39.716
And there's soda and food
in the fridge if you need it.

08:39.796 --> 08:41.176
What are you gonna
tell your parents?

08:41.256 --> 08:43.056
It's just me and my dad.

08:43.066 --> 08:46.846
He's at work most of the time
and the garage is kinda my space.

08:46.926 --> 08:48.896
So, you probably won't see him.

08:48.976 --> 08:51.016
Tomorrow morning, I'm gonna take you back
to Pop's and get you set up in a booth.

08:51.096 --> 08:53.016
After school,
I'm gonna take you to the gym.

08:53.096 --> 08:55.316
Teach you some moves, okay?
Some combos.

08:55.396 --> 08:56.566
So you can defend yourself.

08:56.576 --> 08:57.576
Why are you helping me?

09:00.436 --> 09:03.196
Because, Ricky,

09:03.276 --> 09:04.866
I've been in your shoes.

09:04.946 --> 09:07.036
Alone, on the run,

09:07.116 --> 09:09.296
and I was lucky enough to have friends
who helped me get through that time.

09:10.946 --> 09:13.336
Just... You swear

09:13.406 --> 09:15.216
you won't call Social Services.

09:16.166 --> 09:17.306
I swear.

09:18.596 --> 09:20.346
Goodnight.

09:22.106 --> 09:23.926
- Light on or off?
- On.

09:23.936 --> 09:25.606
If that's okay?

09:31.856 --> 09:33.896
What's going on with you, T.T.?

09:33.976 --> 09:35.776
Has my beauty rendered you
silent?

09:37.726 --> 09:40.856
Or, are you still in a mood about
your sit down with Weatherbee?

09:40.936 --> 09:42.326
Well, if I'm being honest...

09:42.786 --> 09:44.276
yeah.

09:44.346 --> 09:46.076
I had that classroom reserved
as Student Body President.

09:46.146 --> 09:48.246
- Babe, you wear many hats...
- Stunningly.

09:48.316 --> 09:50.866
But when you put on that purple
jacket, you represent our gang.

09:50.946 --> 09:52.576
And now Weatherbee's
out for our blood?

09:52.656 --> 09:54.286
- I can handle Weatherbee.
- Cheryl...

09:54.356 --> 09:57.586
I don't wanna have to suspend
anyone for loose cannon behavior.

09:57.666 --> 09:59.426
Least of all my own girlfriend.

10:01.796 --> 10:03.806
Agreed.

10:03.886 --> 10:07.106
That would make hosting Pretty Poison's
meetings at my house incredibly awkward.

10:07.726 --> 10:09.806
Don't you think?

10:09.816 --> 10:11.566
Unless you have another
headquarters in mind.

10:12.486 --> 10:13.736
With a pool.

10:14.826 --> 10:16.486
The girls can't wait for summer.

10:20.506 --> 10:21.656
What's the update
on the home front, Bee?

10:21.666 --> 10:23.496
My mom's still trying
to sell the house.

10:23.576 --> 10:25.736
I'm still trying to
sabotage her, but

10:25.816 --> 10:29.706
it's only a matter of time till she finds some
ghoul who wants to live in a death house.

10:39.826 --> 10:40.896
What's with Kev?

10:40.976 --> 10:43.186
The Farm, Arch.
They got him, too.

10:43.256 --> 10:44.926
And up next, my house.

10:44.996 --> 10:47.346
Well, my offer still stands.
I know that my trailer is cramped,

10:47.356 --> 10:48.966
but you're more than welcome
to stay with me.

10:49.046 --> 10:50.806
You're always welcome
at the Pembroke, Bee.

10:50.886 --> 10:52.606
You can crash at my place, too.

10:52.686 --> 10:56.146
I mean, I've already got a
homeless kid sleeping in my garage.

10:56.216 --> 10:58.976
Yeah, his name's Ricky.
He ran away from a group home,

10:59.056 --> 11:01.026
and was squatting at the gym.
That's how I found him.

11:01.036 --> 11:02.986
Sounds like me, sophomore year.

11:03.056 --> 11:05.486
Guys, he has a branding
on his arm.

11:05.566 --> 11:08.826
The same one the Warden gave me when I
was in juvie. It says he a sacrifice.

11:08.896 --> 11:10.576
- Oh, my God.
- Is he playing G&G?

11:10.586 --> 11:11.786
I don't know.

11:11.866 --> 11:13.496
I left him at Pop's for the day.

11:13.576 --> 11:15.826
Arch, maybe you should call
Ms. Weiss.

11:15.906 --> 11:18.796
We know her.
We know she'd find him a good family.

11:20.676 --> 11:22.166
Yeah.

11:22.246 --> 11:24.096
Yeah. Would you mind
sending me her number?

11:25.086 --> 11:27.596
Kev, can we talk?

11:27.666 --> 11:29.886
That depends.
What about, Betty?

11:29.896 --> 11:32.806
Just, we haven't checked in
with each other recently.

11:32.886 --> 11:35.346
God, you are so transparent.

11:35.426 --> 11:38.896
Okay, fine. Can we talk about the
fact that you joined the Farm?

11:38.906 --> 11:41.856
And I don't wanna see you disappear down
the same rabbit hole that my mom did,

11:41.936 --> 11:43.946
because she's gone, Kev.

11:44.016 --> 11:45.956
She's selling our house.

11:46.026 --> 11:47.706
Back off, Betty.

11:48.486 --> 11:50.366
You are a detractor.

11:50.446 --> 11:52.546
Better just back off.

11:57.756 --> 12:01.836
All right, Serpents,
let's get right to it.

12:01.916 --> 12:04.916
Any of you guys know about the
break-in to the Chemistry lab?

12:04.936 --> 12:06.346
Kurtz?

12:06.426 --> 12:08.156
What are you smiling about?

12:08.156 --> 12:11.846
Just thinking how looting the
alchemist lair was one of our more

12:11.926 --> 12:13.386
rewarding quests.

12:14.686 --> 12:16.936
Are you serious?

12:16.946 --> 12:19.446
You did that as part of
a G&G game?

12:19.516 --> 12:22.106
You realize Weatherbee's gunning
for us now, right, moron?

12:22.116 --> 12:23.356
You promised us immunity.

12:23.436 --> 12:25.786
Not when you go and
flagrantly break the law.

12:25.856 --> 12:28.026
- You're gonna return the equipment.
- The hell I am.

12:28.106 --> 12:29.406
Freakin' Fizzle Rock junkie!

12:29.476 --> 12:30.916
You wanna go right now?

12:33.536 --> 12:36.746
Don't think that we've forgotten
about you spying on the Gargoyles.

12:36.826 --> 12:40.126
I should have beaten you over the head with
that branding iron when I had the chance.

12:40.136 --> 12:45.466
All right! Back down!
Both of you, right now!

12:45.476 --> 12:49.306
Whatever bad blood existed between
the Serpents and the Gargoyles,

12:49.386 --> 12:52.556
it's over!
We're all Serpents now.

12:52.566 --> 12:54.966
You know, I think it's high time

12:54.986 --> 12:57.596
our newer members
learned about our laws.

12:57.676 --> 12:59.896
Is this for real?

12:59.966 --> 13:03.896
Repeat after me.
In unity, there is strength.

13:03.976 --> 13:06.076
In unity, there's strength.

13:07.996 --> 13:10.196
I can't hear you, Kurtz.

13:10.206 --> 13:11.446
You wanna try that again?

13:11.526 --> 13:14.786
I play by a different set
of rules.

13:14.856 --> 13:16.086
Then you're out of the gang.

13:17.026 --> 13:18.216
You came to me.

13:18.986 --> 13:19.996
Remember?

13:20.076 --> 13:21.886
Your mother came to me.

13:23.156 --> 13:25.056
Invited us into the Serpents.

13:26.476 --> 13:28.296
And looking around,

13:28.376 --> 13:32.436
you need us
more than we need you.

13:32.506 --> 13:35.926
So, if you're rescinding
what you promised us,

13:36.006 --> 13:38.896
then you better come up
with something better to offer.

13:40.346 --> 13:42.856
Before we decide
to throw you guys

13:42.936 --> 13:44.516
out of our gang.

13:47.866 --> 13:51.106
Welcome friends,
to the casino at La Bonne Nuit.

13:51.186 --> 13:52.406
Pretty sick, right?

13:52.476 --> 13:54.406
We've got poker on floor,

13:54.416 --> 13:55.826
blackjack at the bar,

13:55.896 --> 13:58.296
nickle and quarter slots
along the wall,

13:58.366 --> 14:01.116
and a horse race-themed
wheel of chance in the corner.

14:01.196 --> 14:02.976
I got dibs on spinning it.

14:03.056 --> 14:06.206
It goes without saying that discretion
is of the utmost importance.

14:06.216 --> 14:09.716
We don't want the po-po
sniffing around down here.

14:09.726 --> 14:12.386
- Capisce?
- The question has to be asked.

14:13.246 --> 14:14.796
What if we're raided?

14:14.876 --> 14:16.846
We have made upgrades
to the place

14:16.856 --> 14:19.726
that account for such a threat.
Reginald?

14:31.936 --> 14:34.746
At which point I bat my eyelids
and say,

14:36.026 --> 14:38.036
"What secret casino, Officer?"

14:42.246 --> 14:44.076
<i>You know that B&E
at Riverdale High?</i>

14:44.086 --> 14:46.086
Yeah, Weatherbee called me.
What about it?

14:46.166 --> 14:47.546
It was the Gargoyles.

14:47.616 --> 14:50.206
- I figured as much.
- They're starting fights,

14:50.286 --> 14:52.096
they're playing G&G.

14:52.176 --> 14:53.716
You know they outnumber us now?

14:53.796 --> 14:55.546
The original Serpents.

14:55.626 --> 14:57.176
The Gargoyles hold the majority.

14:57.256 --> 15:00.056
Your mom and
her brilliant ideas.

15:00.126 --> 15:02.516
Problem is they have no honor,

15:02.596 --> 15:05.356
there's no duty,
there's no sense of purpose.

15:05.426 --> 15:09.436
And it finally made me realize,
in turn, the bigger issue,

15:09.446 --> 15:12.106
and it's been this way
for a while.

15:12.116 --> 15:14.906
- Neither do the Serpents.
- We talked about this, boy.

15:14.916 --> 15:17.906
You gotta figure out what your
version of the Serpents is gonna be.

15:17.986 --> 15:19.196
You gotta give them,

15:19.276 --> 15:21.616
and now the Gargoyles, a reason

15:21.626 --> 15:25.246
to wake up every day, to put that
jacket on and wear it with pride.

15:25.326 --> 15:27.246
Or chaos will ensue.

15:27.326 --> 15:28.756
When the bad guys outnumber you,

15:30.156 --> 15:31.916
you gotta out think 'em.

15:31.996 --> 15:35.436
And give your crew something that
they can sink their teeth into.

15:41.006 --> 15:42.766
Looking for your friend?

15:42.836 --> 15:45.146
Hey, Pop, yeah. What happened to him?
Where'd he go?

15:45.226 --> 15:46.806
A group of thugs came by,

15:46.816 --> 15:48.946
saw him through the window,
started banging on the glass.

15:49.026 --> 15:51.986
- Oh, no.
- Never seen someone run so fast.

15:51.996 --> 15:54.496
- Into the kitchen, out the back door.
- What about the thugs?

15:54.566 --> 15:56.446
Circled around.
Took off after him.

15:56.516 --> 15:58.326
- Crap!
- Archie...

15:59.356 --> 16:01.166
he left something behind.

16:01.246 --> 16:03.956
He'd been drawing on a placemat.

16:04.026 --> 16:05.326
What do you mean?
Drawing what?

17:11.265 --> 17:13.525
That's difficult
with runaways, Archie.

17:13.605 --> 17:16.694
A lot of them end up hitchhiking
to Centerville, joining gangs.

17:16.775 --> 17:19.605
Often it's because they've rejected
our efforts to help and replace them.

17:19.685 --> 17:22.525
Well, actually he was in
foster care before.

17:22.605 --> 17:25.825
- Wasn't he, Arch?
- Yeah. A place called Santa Lucia Shelter.

17:25.905 --> 17:28.045
I know them.
It's one of the better home in town.

17:28.115 --> 17:30.625
Well, Ricky said some of
the people there hurt him,

17:30.695 --> 17:34.135
- and branded a symbol into his arm.
- Gang-related?

17:34.205 --> 17:36.175
We've been seeing that
more and more.

17:36.255 --> 17:39.925
Gryphons and Gargoyles may not be in the
news anymore, but it's everywhere else.

17:40.005 --> 17:41.685
Did he look something like this?

17:42.555 --> 17:45.055
Damn. Yeah.
Yeah, that's him.

17:45.125 --> 17:47.075
I'll make some phone calls.

17:47.085 --> 17:49.395
If we can find a match in the database,
we'll track him down sooner or later.

17:49.475 --> 17:51.185
Either way, I'll be in touch.

17:51.255 --> 17:52.765
Thank you, Ms. Weiss.

17:52.775 --> 17:54.195
Can I make some copies of that?

17:57.265 --> 17:59.905
<i>Mija.</i>

17:59.985 --> 18:03.695
Word on the street is that you've
turned your speakeasy into a casino?

18:03.775 --> 18:06.285
- Is that what your spies tell you?
- Hmm.

18:06.295 --> 18:08.745
It's actually a fortuitous turn
of events.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.865
- How so?
- Well, I'm in the process of courting the business

18:11.945 --> 18:14.205
of a gentleman who owns
a playing card company.

18:14.285 --> 18:17.875
And I'm pitching him the idea of
moving production from his factory

18:17.955 --> 18:19.505
to my prison.

18:19.575 --> 18:22.005
He gets to produce those fine
cards for pennies on the dollar,

18:22.085 --> 18:25.005
and my for-profit prison
inmates earn a small wage.

18:25.085 --> 18:27.385
Allowing you to rake in
a tidy sum.

18:27.465 --> 18:29.845
- Mmm.
- That's shady, Daddy.

18:29.925 --> 18:33.275
At any rate, I'd love to bring him to
your casino to show him a good time.

18:33.355 --> 18:34.685
And I trust you'll make him
feel important?

18:34.765 --> 18:36.525
I always do, Daddy.

18:37.935 --> 18:41.285
But if I help you land
this mega client,

18:41.355 --> 18:43.285
how 'bout you shave off
some of my debt?

18:44.275 --> 18:46.115
Say, 5%?

18:49.705 --> 18:51.045
I'll consider it.

18:55.495 --> 18:58.005
You know, you probably
don't know this about me,

18:58.995 --> 19:01.085
but when I was your age,

19:01.165 --> 19:03.215
I used to perform
at The Whyte Wyrm.

19:03.285 --> 19:06.215
Yeah, I was kinda like
the Joan Jett of Riverdale.

19:06.295 --> 19:10.015
And now, let me guess,
you're looking to make a comeback?

19:11.085 --> 19:13.355
I got an itch to scratch, yeah.

19:14.485 --> 19:15.725
What do you think?

19:15.805 --> 19:17.275
I'd like a little something
in return.

19:18.635 --> 19:21.115
5% shaved off the debt
I owe you.

19:25.525 --> 19:26.915
I can make that work.

19:30.145 --> 19:31.455
See ya, kids.

19:36.365 --> 19:38.335
Hey, Josie,
I'm sorry to interrupt.

19:38.415 --> 19:39.845
Can I talk to you
about something?

19:39.915 --> 19:41.215
Yeah. For sure.

19:43.625 --> 19:45.345
Uh...

19:45.425 --> 19:48.425
Have you noticed
Kevin has gotten in

19:48.505 --> 19:52.975
very deep, very fast
with the Farm.

19:53.045 --> 19:55.095
And last night
as I was leaving school,

19:55.175 --> 19:58.195
I saw him holding his hand
over a Bunsen burner,

19:58.265 --> 20:01.685
along with a bunch of other
Farmies doing the same.

20:01.695 --> 20:03.195
Ah, Kevin!

20:03.275 --> 20:05.705
Groups like the Farm, cults,

20:05.775 --> 20:09.445
prey on emotionally
vulnerable people.

20:09.525 --> 20:11.285
That's why I think
they targeted Kevin.

20:14.695 --> 20:16.875
Okay, well...

20:18.325 --> 20:20.035
I haven't told my mom,

20:20.055 --> 20:22.345
or Mr. Keller, but...

20:24.055 --> 20:27.425
Over the last week,
I have heard Kevin sneaking out at night.

20:27.495 --> 20:32.015
And I assumed he was going
back to Fox Forest, but

20:33.065 --> 20:34.935
maybe he's going to meet them.

20:37.095 --> 20:38.195
<i>You weren't kidding.</i>

20:39.625 --> 20:42.365
- This kid's into some really dark stuff.
- Yeah.

20:43.555 --> 20:45.815
Got a sketch of him, too.

20:45.895 --> 20:48.485
Pop Tate said some thugs
chased him outta the diner.

20:48.565 --> 20:50.155
Thugs?

20:50.225 --> 20:52.535
- You mean gang members?
- Yeah, probably.

20:52.605 --> 20:54.705
Didn't you just recruit
a bunch of Gargoyles?

20:56.255 --> 20:57.705
More like my mom did, but yeah.

20:57.775 --> 20:59.625
Well, are they
still playing G&G?

21:02.705 --> 21:04.505
His name's Ricky.

21:04.575 --> 21:07.345
Doesn anybody recognize him?

21:07.425 --> 21:09.465
Well, he's in trouble,
so we're gonna help Archie find him.

21:09.545 --> 21:11.345
Break the town into sections
and we'll split up the work.

21:11.425 --> 21:15.385
You want us to go looking
for some dumb kid?

21:15.465 --> 21:17.355
Was it your crew
that came after him at Pop's?

21:17.435 --> 21:21.105
- Looking to make him a sacrifice?
- No.

21:21.115 --> 21:24.445
Dude, we have other business
of the chemical kind.

21:25.975 --> 21:27.565
But there are others out there.

21:27.645 --> 21:30.405
Outliers that broke away
when we joined the Serpents.

21:30.475 --> 21:34.195
You mean, there are Gargoyles out
there that are even crazier than you?

21:34.275 --> 21:36.535
Will you shut up?

21:36.605 --> 21:39.205
If what you're saying is true, then that's all
the more reason that we need to find him fast.

21:39.275 --> 21:41.295
You better get to it then.

21:46.665 --> 21:47.965
We'll help look.

21:52.885 --> 21:54.675
Ladies and gentlemen,

21:54.685 --> 21:57.385
we have a very special treat
for you tonight.

21:57.465 --> 21:59.725
Making her debut
at La Bonne Nuit,

21:59.795 --> 22:01.735
Ms. Gladys Jones.

22:10.855 --> 22:16.235
<i>♪ Baby can you

22:16.315 --> 22:20.245

<i>♪ Oh Lord, please don't

Come on, when's
the real show start?

22:42.175 --> 22:43.435
Wait, wait, wait, wait...

22:43.505 --> 22:45.105
That dude's being
a total asshat.

22:45.175 --> 22:49.025
I know, but he's also a VIP.

22:49.035 --> 22:52.775
<i>♪ ...you're bound

22:52.855 --> 22:56.025
So, you've got good pipes, yeah?
Why don't you give Gladys some tips.

22:56.035 --> 22:57.945
I'll give her a tip, all right.

22:58.025 --> 23:01.995
Oh, yeah? And I got
a sharp tip for you boys, too.

23:04.865 --> 23:07.745
- Okay, now you can throw him out.
- On it.

23:07.825 --> 23:11.085
- All right.
- I'm gonna ask you to leave, bro.

23:11.095 --> 23:13.675
Are you kiddin' me?
Cheekbones here is bouncing me?

23:13.745 --> 23:15.765
- That's it. Come on.
- Get your hands off!

23:22.755 --> 23:24.645
Veronica...

23:24.715 --> 23:27.485
I hope you didn't just cost
me a million-dollar deal.

23:37.035 --> 23:39.995
Once you start crossing
the threshold, you can't stop.

23:40.585 --> 23:42.085
That's the key.

23:42.165 --> 23:44.745
You must believe
that you will be protected.

23:44.755 --> 23:47.085
Believe that you will be forged.

23:47.165 --> 23:51.255
Only through the fire can we be
cleansed and leave our past behind.

23:51.265 --> 23:55.435
Conquer our fears, expiate our
sins, exorcise our demons.

23:57.455 --> 23:58.725
Brother Kevin,

24:00.585 --> 24:02.065
it's your turn.

24:03.135 --> 24:04.735
Oh, my God. Kevin!

24:05.595 --> 24:07.775
Kevin, don't! Kev, stop!

24:07.855 --> 24:09.615
No. Brother Kevin, don't stop.

24:09.685 --> 24:12.065
Believe in yourself.
Believe in the Farm.

24:12.135 --> 24:14.825
Believe that the embers
are a cool mountain stream.

24:22.445 --> 24:23.705
Brother Kevin!

24:25.485 --> 24:28.205
You are purified! We are whole!

24:28.285 --> 24:30.925
We are one! We are one!

24:33.761 --> 24:35.351
Archie.

24:35.361 --> 24:37.441
Got most of my Serpents out
looking for your boy Ricky.

24:37.521 --> 24:39.201
But I think I got a place that
you and I should check out.

24:40.101 --> 24:41.531
Gargoyle ground zero.

25:01.701 --> 25:02.971
All these names...

25:04.161 --> 25:05.181
they're sacrifice.

25:06.041 --> 25:07.141
Jug...

25:07.541 --> 25:08.381
Wait.

25:08.391 --> 25:09.231
Archie.

25:14.101 --> 25:15.641
Ricky?

25:15.721 --> 25:17.191
What the hell
are you doing in here?

25:18.721 --> 25:20.321
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

25:21.661 --> 25:23.731
I came here 'cause I heard
they all cleared out.

25:23.811 --> 25:25.621
The Gargoyles?
Yeah, they're gone.

25:25.691 --> 25:28.151
I thought this would be the last place
they'd come looking for me, but...

25:28.231 --> 25:29.851
I'll never be able to
escape them.

25:29.931 --> 25:32.661
I'm marked for death.
That's what this symbol means. Isn't it?

25:32.731 --> 25:35.791
- And you have it, too.
- Yeah.

25:35.861 --> 25:38.751
It means sacrifice,
but that's not gonna happen.

25:38.761 --> 25:40.461
Okay? I swear.

25:40.531 --> 25:42.631
- Right, Jug?
- Yeah.

25:42.711 --> 25:43.941
That's right.

25:44.011 --> 25:46.351
That said, let's get
the hell outta here.

26:00.151 --> 26:01.441
Betty.

26:03.891 --> 26:05.861
You shouldn't have run off last night.
You should have stayed.

26:05.931 --> 26:08.191
Are you two here to go on
record about what I saw?

26:08.201 --> 26:09.861
To quote myself,

26:09.941 --> 26:13.461
"A dangerous cult
of deluded teenagers

26:13.531 --> 26:16.581
who gather for occult-like,
self-harming activities."

26:17.901 --> 26:21.661
Betty, last night was scary,
and...

26:21.681 --> 26:26.881
And fun, cathartic. It felt euphoric,
like nothing I've ever felt.

26:26.951 --> 26:28.431
That's your point of view.

26:28.511 --> 26:31.671
I think my readers and your
dad will have a different one.

26:31.751 --> 26:33.551
You're not publishing
that article, Betty.

26:33.631 --> 26:35.521
- No?
- Tell her why, Kevin.

26:36.761 --> 26:39.141
If you do, we'll tell everyone

26:39.151 --> 26:41.601
about the shady man
your mom killed in the kitchen.

26:41.611 --> 26:44.611
How you and Jughead dumped
his car in Swedlow Swamp,

26:44.691 --> 26:48.231
and how Mr. Jones dissolved
his body with lye in the woods.

26:48.311 --> 26:50.441
Remember, Betty,
thanks to your mom,

26:50.451 --> 26:53.751
everyone at the Farm knows
all of your dirty secrets.

27:12.001 --> 27:13.731
You know, when I was fighting
in juvie,

27:15.341 --> 27:17.641
this is how I survived.

27:17.651 --> 27:19.561
How I avoided getting
sacrificed.

27:20.471 --> 27:21.481
By fighting.

27:26.061 --> 27:28.111
How did you get sucked
into all of this?

27:28.181 --> 27:29.771
Like I was telling you before,

27:29.851 --> 27:33.831
at the shelter, some older guys
were into G&G and Fizzle Rocks.

27:33.911 --> 27:36.161
They would come by
and try to rope in younger kids

27:36.241 --> 27:38.001
to use 'em as runners.
'Cause...

27:38.081 --> 27:40.251
The younger you are,
the less time you serve if you get caught.

27:42.511 --> 27:44.291
When they asked me,

27:44.371 --> 27:46.291
I turned them down.
That's when they branded me,

27:46.371 --> 27:49.291
and when I left the shelter...
I think I should keep moving.

27:49.371 --> 27:52.511
- I don't want them finding you, too.
- Don't worry about me.

27:52.591 --> 27:56.131
And running isn't gonna
solve anything, trust me.

27:56.211 --> 27:57.141
I would know.

27:58.601 --> 28:00.101
You're not alone in this, Ricky.

28:00.171 --> 28:01.821
Okay? Not anymore.

28:03.181 --> 28:05.491
We found the kid,
but he's still in danger.

28:06.551 --> 28:07.981
So is Archie for that matter.

28:08.061 --> 28:09.571
So, what's the next play?

28:09.651 --> 28:11.371
It's a classic gambit.

28:11.441 --> 28:13.441
The hunters become the hunted.

28:13.451 --> 28:16.321
Kurtz had said that there are
some rogue Goyles.

28:16.401 --> 28:18.541
So you two...

28:18.621 --> 28:20.991
Heckle and Jeckle,
start talking.

28:21.001 --> 28:22.881
I want the names
of those outliers.

28:22.951 --> 28:25.751
And I want sentries posted
at the Gargoyle lair.

28:25.821 --> 28:28.171
Jughead! You need to
come right now.

28:28.241 --> 28:29.461
What? Toni?

28:29.471 --> 28:30.931
Kurtz is about to kill Fangs.

28:35.251 --> 28:36.761
- Fangs!
- What the hell!

28:36.771 --> 28:38.181
Guys! Guys, help!

28:38.251 --> 28:41.601
Don't be scared, you dirty
Serpent spy.

28:41.681 --> 28:44.521
You're about to ascend.
And you'll fly, too.

28:44.591 --> 28:46.071
Kurtz... don't.

28:46.141 --> 28:47.741
Happy landings, worthless snake.

28:48.431 --> 28:49.741
No!

29:04.382 --> 29:06.542
Excuse me.

29:06.552 --> 29:08.752
Are you bartending now?

29:08.832 --> 29:11.462
Your boy toy makes
watery drinks. So I thought,

29:11.542 --> 29:14.012
hey, I'll just help myself.

29:14.082 --> 29:16.012
- Can I get you something?
- Unbelievable.

29:16.092 --> 29:17.682
Poppin' joint
you got here, Hiram.

29:17.752 --> 29:19.972
Glad you like it, Don.
You know I've always wanted a casino.

29:20.052 --> 29:21.982
Even picked out
those light fixtures myself.

29:30.472 --> 29:31.992
This has to stop.

29:32.072 --> 29:33.862
They're acting like
they own the place.

29:33.942 --> 29:35.032
My place.

29:35.102 --> 29:36.912
I can't believe I'm about
to say this,

29:36.992 --> 29:38.412
but I miss the Serpents.

29:39.402 --> 29:40.912
We could use the extra muscle.

29:44.412 --> 29:48.292
Reggie, how have our takes been
since our casino upgrade?

29:48.372 --> 29:49.802
Almost double. Why?

29:51.722 --> 29:54.352
I might need to siphon
some of it off.

29:55.512 --> 29:57.022
For tactical reasons.

30:02.212 --> 30:03.722
Ricky.

30:03.732 --> 30:05.022
What's up?

30:05.092 --> 30:07.442
- Sorry, I was just...
- No, you're good.

30:07.452 --> 30:10.452
Keep it. If you want it,
it's yours.

30:10.522 --> 30:12.272
- You serious?
- Yeah.

30:12.352 --> 30:14.072
Come downstairs,
I want you to meet my dad.

30:14.142 --> 30:14.992
What?

30:16.042 --> 30:17.622
Ricky, it's okay.

30:17.702 --> 30:19.862
I spoke to him.
He's gonna help.

30:19.942 --> 30:22.912
Look, we gotta find you a safe
place to live permanently.

30:22.922 --> 30:25.202
- But, Archie...
- With a good family.

30:25.282 --> 30:27.022
All right? One we will
all meet.

30:27.022 --> 30:29.302
And I'll be checking in on you.
We can hang out whenever you want.

30:29.382 --> 30:31.802
And I'll keep giving you
boxing lessons at the gym.

30:31.882 --> 30:33.632
You just gotta trust me.

30:33.642 --> 30:35.622
<i>He dropped Fangs for no reason.</i>

30:35.702 --> 30:38.882
If I hadn't broken his fall, he would
have snapped his neck, or even worse.

30:38.962 --> 30:41.642
You gotta take drastic action, boy.
Words aren't gonna do it.

30:41.652 --> 30:44.642
I agree. A big action.
One that's long overdue,

30:44.652 --> 30:47.272
and not just for Kurtz,
but for all the Serpents.

30:47.342 --> 30:49.942
Old and new.
Dad, I'm talking about the next chapter.

30:49.952 --> 30:53.612
Something that's gonna give us purpose,
and keep us on the right side of the law.

30:53.682 --> 30:57.162
Mobilizing that gang search for
Archie's lost boy gave me the idea.

30:57.242 --> 30:58.332
And you did, too.

31:00.252 --> 31:03.122
<i>Let's not mince words, Toni.</i>

31:03.192 --> 31:05.332
I'd like to offer
the Pretty Poisons

31:05.412 --> 31:07.122
full time employment
at La Bonne Nuit.

31:07.202 --> 31:08.752
My girls aren't waitresses.

31:08.822 --> 31:10.752
You misunderstand me.

31:10.822 --> 31:14.462
Gladys Jones and my father swarm around
La Bonne Nuit as if they own the place.

31:14.542 --> 31:17.222
And I fear that their presence
could cost me my business.

31:19.042 --> 31:21.022
As well as my sanity.

31:21.092 --> 31:23.692
I need muscle to keep them
and their cronies out.

31:23.762 --> 31:25.862
That's where your
Pretty Poisons come in.

31:27.012 --> 31:28.222
What do you say?

31:28.232 --> 31:31.072
Oh, and I have and advance.

31:35.242 --> 31:37.032
If you have to run this idea
by Cheryl...

31:37.112 --> 31:39.822
They won't be necessary.

31:39.902 --> 31:41.292
We've got a deal.

31:57.222 --> 31:58.722
Mom?

31:58.802 --> 32:00.512
- Hey.
- What's happening?

32:00.582 --> 32:03.142
Better start packing.
We're in escrow. I sold the house.

32:04.802 --> 32:06.402
To who?

32:06.472 --> 32:09.522
I don't know. In true Riverdale
fashion, some anonymous buyer.

32:09.592 --> 32:12.022
I'm sure it's someone overseas.

32:12.032 --> 32:14.022
Grab some boxes.
You better hop to it.

32:14.032 --> 32:16.162
We need to be outta here
sooner, rather than later.

32:19.392 --> 32:22.032
What the hell is he doing here?

32:22.042 --> 32:23.952
- I made the invitation.
- Why?

32:24.022 --> 32:27.752
Kurtz boasted that the Serpents
need him more than he needs us.

32:29.452 --> 32:30.622
I disagree.

32:30.702 --> 32:32.332
But one thing is true.

32:32.412 --> 32:33.832
The Serpents are rudderless.

32:33.912 --> 32:35.752
We lack identity and focus.

32:35.762 --> 32:38.882
We're better and stronger
when we're task-focused.

32:38.952 --> 32:41.262
That's why with the help
of my father, Serpent Emeritus,

32:41.272 --> 32:42.472
we've come up with a plan...

32:43.772 --> 32:45.842
to deputize the Serpents.

32:45.922 --> 32:48.552
To become partners with the
Riverdale Sheriff's department.

32:48.632 --> 32:50.392
You'll work for me.

32:50.472 --> 32:51.942
Help me with investigations,

32:52.022 --> 32:54.142
be my eyes and ears
in the community.

32:54.152 --> 32:56.402
In return, you'll get paid,

32:56.412 --> 32:59.282
and receive school credit
to help you apply to colleges.

32:59.362 --> 33:01.032
This is about bringing order,

33:01.102 --> 33:02.682
ensuring our survival.

33:02.682 --> 33:04.652
But this is gonna be a brand-new
chapter for the Serpents,

33:04.732 --> 33:06.082
and we can't be
divided about it.

33:07.112 --> 33:08.622
So let's put it to a vote.

33:08.702 --> 33:10.252
If it's not unanimous...

33:12.152 --> 33:13.502
there's the damn door.

33:15.632 --> 33:17.052
All in favor?

33:35.992 --> 33:37.152
Good riddance.

33:39.822 --> 33:42.232
Sweet. Do we get to carry guns?

33:42.312 --> 33:43.782
- Absolutely not.
- No.

33:43.852 --> 33:46.572
Whoa. Four to one. Smoked you.

33:46.652 --> 33:49.082
You got lucky that time.

33:53.202 --> 33:55.002
All right, I gotta take this.

33:57.032 --> 33:59.232
Hey, Ms. Weiss.

33:59.242 --> 34:02.592
<i>Archie, the administrator at Santa
Lucia Shelter finally got back to me.</i>

34:02.662 --> 34:04.922
<i>He found a match.
But, Archie...</i>

34:05.002 --> 34:08.141
<i>Ricky's full name is
Ricardo DeSantos.</i>

34:10.022 --> 34:11.601
DeSantos?

34:11.672 --> 34:13.522
As in Joaquin DeSantos?

34:13.601 --> 34:16.942
<i>Yes. According to his records,
Ricky is Joaquin's younger brother.</i>

34:21.112 --> 34:23.192
Hang on, I don't understand.

34:23.202 --> 34:25.942
Joaquin's dead,
and now his brother...

34:26.022 --> 34:29.542
<i>His file shows Ricky has a history
of violent behavior and self-harm.</i>

34:29.621 --> 34:30.962
<i>Where is he now?</i>

34:32.212 --> 34:33.542
He's at my house.

34:33.621 --> 34:35.542
Look, Ms. Weiss, I gotta go.

34:35.621 --> 34:37.331
<i>Archie, please be careful.</i>

34:37.411 --> 34:38.342
I'll call you right back.

34:42.871 --> 34:44.012
All right.

34:45.712 --> 34:46.812
Ricky?

34:51.922 --> 34:52.982
Ricky?

35:09.062 --> 35:11.462
Ricky, come on. It's not funny.

35:14.572 --> 35:15.542
You in there?

35:39.972 --> 35:41.942
What are you doing?

35:42.022 --> 35:44.732
It's the only way the Gargoyles will let
me in and let me play the game with them.

35:44.812 --> 35:46.732
Gargoyles?

35:46.812 --> 35:48.612
Ricky, listen to me,
you don't wanna do this.

35:48.622 --> 35:50.082
I have to finish what I started.

35:51.122 --> 35:53.282
You mean Joaquin,
that's your brother.

35:53.292 --> 35:55.532
Right? I knew Joaquin.

35:55.612 --> 35:57.582
Okay? He was a good guy, but...

35:57.592 --> 36:00.622
He listened to the wrong people
and he wound up dead because of it.

36:00.632 --> 36:03.582
If I don't do this, the
Gargoyles, they won't protect me.

36:03.662 --> 36:05.632
Protect you?
They marked you for sacrifice.

36:05.642 --> 36:06.962
The same way they did Joaquin.

36:06.972 --> 36:10.722
What you mean this?
I gave it to myself.

36:10.802 --> 36:12.482
And at the lair,
I added my name under yours.

36:14.152 --> 36:15.802
You...

36:15.812 --> 36:17.062
You're playing me?

36:21.012 --> 36:22.442
Is that how my brother
stabbed you?

36:23.352 --> 36:25.032
- Archie?
- Dad, don't come in!

36:30.692 --> 36:32.702
Son. What the hell happened?

36:36.641 --> 36:38.431
I'm sorry, Dad.
I'm such an idiot.

36:38.441 --> 36:40.981
You're not an idiot, son.
Just...

36:41.851 --> 36:43.151
got a big heart.

36:44.091 --> 36:45.741
That's so messed up though.

36:46.981 --> 36:48.191
You think he'll come back?

36:48.261 --> 36:50.651
With my luck, definitely.

36:50.661 --> 36:52.911
Probably at a worst time,
and with his friends.

36:55.201 --> 36:56.701
Hold on.

37:17.961 --> 37:20.061
The first night of the new job.

37:20.891 --> 37:22.761
You coming tonight, babe?

37:22.841 --> 37:25.891
Mmm, no. Think I'll pass.

37:25.971 --> 37:27.891
Feeling a little
under the weather tonight.

37:27.971 --> 37:30.401
Well, see you later?

37:30.471 --> 37:32.661
- I'll be asleep.
- Okay.

37:55.081 --> 37:56.801
Sorry, lady. Can't admit you.

37:56.871 --> 37:59.971
- Excuse me?
- New house rules, Ms. Jones.

37:59.981 --> 38:03.721
You're not allowed into La Bonne
Nuit without an engraved invitation.

38:03.801 --> 38:05.981
You think you can stop me?

38:07.361 --> 38:10.781
Gladys, step off.

38:10.861 --> 38:15.111
I've hired these young ladies here to
block your admittance to my establishment

38:15.181 --> 38:16.911
until you learn to play
by the rules.

38:17.611 --> 38:18.951
My rules.

38:20.791 --> 38:21.831
Hmm.

38:29.531 --> 38:32.711
<i>Mija,</i> I hope you saved me
my favorite booth?

38:32.791 --> 38:34.261
Not so fast, Daddy.

38:35.631 --> 38:38.381
You are also no longer welcome
at La Bonne Nuit.

38:38.391 --> 38:41.341
At least not until you start
showing me proper respect.

38:41.421 --> 38:44.681
And don't try to flex your
financial hold over me.

38:44.761 --> 38:47.061
I'll pay you back,
like we agreed.

38:47.141 --> 38:48.971
But moving forward,

38:49.051 --> 38:51.941
I'm running my business, my way.

38:56.191 --> 38:57.581
Okay.

39:20.371 --> 39:22.221
Hey, I'm going out
for more bubble wrap.

39:22.291 --> 39:24.561
I expect progress in the
packing by the time I get back.

40:13.061 --> 40:14.401
Fresh coat of paint...

40:16.511 --> 40:18.701
couple atomic bombs...

40:20.521 --> 40:24.251
This place will be a nice HQ for
the new and improved Serpents.

40:27.411 --> 40:28.751
I don't know what to do, Jug.

40:30.901 --> 40:32.791
I remain marked for death.

40:32.861 --> 40:35.621
I let my guard down
for a second,

40:35.701 --> 40:39.001
and people come out of the
woodworks to try and kill me.

40:39.081 --> 40:42.801
Ricky must have been targeting me for
days, if not, weeks.

40:42.871 --> 40:44.141
When is this gonna end?

40:45.041 --> 40:46.681
I don't know.

40:46.761 --> 40:48.641
Maybe it's time you make
this thing come to a head.

40:48.711 --> 40:51.101
What, my life?

40:51.171 --> 40:54.151
This Gryphons and Gargoyles game
that you're apparently still playing.

41:01.231 --> 41:02.531
Will you help me?

41:02.611 --> 41:04.741
- Obviously.
- Count me in, too.

41:06.191 --> 41:08.041
We're here for you, Arch.

41:10.531 --> 41:11.831
You're looking cheery.

41:14.881 --> 41:16.211
Yeah.

41:17.631 --> 41:19.681
I guess I just feel
a lot better about things.

41:27.581 --> 41:29.351
Betty? Betty?

41:35.131 --> 41:36.361
Oh, my God!
