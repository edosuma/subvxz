00:36.936 --> 00:41.566
Los Angeles late at night is much like
any big American city late at night.

00:41.641 --> 00:44.974
At 2:00 a.m. People are either
making a mess or cleaning it up.

00:45.045 --> 00:47.411
Tonight's my night
to do the cleaning up.

00:47.480 --> 00:50.540
My name, most of the time,
is Irwin Fletcher.

00:50.617 --> 00:55.350
I write under the name of Jane
Doe. That's the kind of gal I am.

00:55.422 --> 00:58.255
This is a Greek seafood house,
part of a very successful chain.

00:58.324 --> 01:00.724
But, believe me,
it's not because of the food.

01:00.794 --> 01:03.729
113,000
from basketball.

01:03.797 --> 01:06.857
List it as codfish.

01:08.234 --> 01:10.896
120,000 from
the Gonzalez fight.

01:10.970 --> 01:15.839
That includes 60 from
our chain in the Valley.

01:15.909 --> 01:19.401
Twenty from Long Beach.
120 total.

01:19.479 --> 01:22.607
Put that
under halibut.

01:22.682 --> 01:25.412
180,000
from the track.

01:25.485 --> 01:27.419
Scrod.

01:27.487 --> 01:30.047
We already got over two
million in scrod this month.

01:30.123 --> 01:33.149
Scrod's making a comeback,
all right?

01:33.226 --> 01:35.194
So how are you listing
my stake?

01:35.261 --> 01:39.527
Breakage.
$ 75,000 worth of breakage?

01:45.805 --> 01:48.865
We're Greeks! We dance,
we break plates, we're clumsy!

01:48.942 --> 01:51.934
Cut the fighting. We gotta
be cross town in 30 minutes.

01:52.011 --> 01:53.945
You wanna wash up?

01:54.013 --> 01:57.176
Nah. My wife gets suspicious if I come
home and my hands don't smell like fish.

01:57.250 --> 01:59.377
I got it.
You get the lights.

01:59.452 --> 02:02.387
Where's Poppa?
In the back.

02:02.455 --> 02:05.322
Tell him to snap it up. We'll meet him
in the car. Phil, I'll drop you off first.

02:05.391 --> 02:07.825
You better.

02:21.374 --> 02:25.606
- Hi.
- What's your name, little lady?

02:25.678 --> 02:30.775
My name? Peggy Lee... Zorba.
Peggy Lee Zorba.

02:30.850 --> 02:35.116
- You're cute!
- Do you mind if I freshen up a little bit?

02:35.188 --> 02:37.748
Splash a little water
on my face.

02:37.824 --> 02:40.190
Whatever makes you
feel sexy.

02:40.260 --> 02:42.728
Okay.

02:42.795 --> 02:46.458
Just wait outside.
I'll be right out.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.383
What the hell was that?

03:10.456 --> 03:12.947
- Jesus.! If it's a cop, kill him.
- Hi. Mary Poppins!

03:13.026 --> 03:15.221
If it's a reporter,
cripple him.

03:31.344 --> 03:33.835
You're never driving again!

03:33.913 --> 03:36.347
I just did what
you told me to do.

03:36.416 --> 03:39.180
There's a new thing called
brakes.! Will you shut up.!

03:43.590 --> 03:48.653
Good. Brilliant as usual, Fletch.
We'll run it in the next edition.

03:48.728 --> 03:51.492
Great. See you
in two weeks.

03:51.564 --> 03:57.264
Uh, Fletch, there's... "Uh, Fletch"?
Frank, I see a double-cross in your eyes.

03:57.337 --> 04:00.500
You promised me a vacation and I'm
taking it. Right after the sewer story.

04:00.573 --> 04:03.599
What are you talking about?
You can't do this to me.

04:03.676 --> 04:07.043
I spent eight nights on my knees for you
dressed like Dolly Parton at a funeral.

04:07.113 --> 04:10.571
I got felt up. I got
dishpan hands and sore knees!

04:10.650 --> 04:13.141
Three guys tried to kill me.
And do you give a crap?

04:13.219 --> 04:16.017
You promised me a vacation!
And you're gonna get a vacation.

04:16.089 --> 04:19.183
As soon as you research and write the
sewer system expose. You owe me a vacation!

04:19.259 --> 04:21.317
In July you're gonna have it!
That's two months away.

04:21.394 --> 04:23.692
That's why you're such a great
reporter. You know the facts.

04:23.763 --> 04:27.631
By the way, the new computer
disallowed your undocumented expenses.

04:27.700 --> 04:30.328
- It'll come out of this week's pay.
- You can't do that.

04:30.403 --> 04:34.635
There's nothing I can do about it. It's
amazing. It's all done automatically.

04:50.757 --> 04:53.885
On top of everything else,
I think I'm getting my period.

05:21.154 --> 05:24.453
No wonder I got a fumigation
alert. How'd you get in here?

05:24.524 --> 05:26.890
The window was open.

05:26.959 --> 05:30.622
I knocked, and I could swear
I heard you say, "Come in."

05:30.697 --> 05:34.895
You really know how to cover your ass, Gillet.
Although those pants are a huge mistake.

05:34.967 --> 05:40.405
You owe me $4,381
in back alimony.

05:40.473 --> 05:43.465
What? I was married to you?

05:43.543 --> 05:48.446
You're right. I've been foolishly
squandering my salary on food and heat.

05:48.514 --> 05:52.041
You have one week to comply
with Judge Proctor's orders.

05:52.118 --> 05:55.087
Payment in full.
Otherwise you go to jail.

05:55.154 --> 05:57.520
Wendy doesn't need
the money.

05:57.590 --> 06:03.119
I hear she's been... banging some
balding, wimpy lawyer who can't get it up.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.790
- May I see that?
- Be my guest.

06:05.865 --> 06:08.561
It's a nice briefcase.
Couldn't guess your weight?

06:08.634 --> 06:10.898
Oh! I'm sorry.
I got it.

06:10.970 --> 06:13.370
Never mind,
I'll take care of it.

06:13.439 --> 06:16.306
Look at this. A note from
the Oakwood Potency Clinic.

06:16.376 --> 06:21.177
"Sorry to inform you, our machines cannot
process sperm counts as low as yours."

06:21.247 --> 06:23.613
Here we are. What
about this? Be careful!

06:23.683 --> 06:26.277
Uh-oh!
I am terribly sorry!

06:26.352 --> 06:28.320
You did that intentionally.
No, I did not. I really didn't.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.948
That was good juice too.
Leave it alone.

06:31.023 --> 06:34.117
Good idea. My mistake. Where
are you going with that?

06:34.193 --> 06:36.821
My mess.
I'll clean it up.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.989
- What are you doing?
- What's this?

06:39.065 --> 06:42.466
You are damaging personal
property and I'm gonna...

06:42.535 --> 06:46.027
The ink is running.
I didn't expect that.

06:47.340 --> 06:50.639
There we are!
Clean as a whistle.

06:50.710 --> 06:55.010
Thanks for coming by, Marvin.
Expect to hear from my lawyer.

06:55.081 --> 06:59.347
Oh, Gillet, one more thing. Come
back here. It's very important.

06:59.419 --> 07:03.685
They're doing a thing now where they make an
incision in the scalp, push the hair together.

07:03.756 --> 07:08.887
Or you could try a transplant. Maybe the hair
from your ass might make you smarter. Bye.

07:08.961 --> 07:12.988
Betty, how 'bout lunch
at the In-N-Out Burger?

07:13.065 --> 07:14.999
I'm not hungry.

07:15.067 --> 07:17.695
Forget the burger. How about
just the "in and out"?

07:17.770 --> 07:20.705
Very well.
How about just the "in"?

07:22.942 --> 07:24.876
Ooh!

07:33.753 --> 07:36.153
Fletch, answer your phone.

07:42.428 --> 07:44.362
In-N-Out Burger.

07:44.430 --> 07:47.024
May I take your order please?
Mr. Irwin Fletcher?

07:47.099 --> 07:50.227
This is Amanda Ray Ross. I
represented your Aunt Belle Fletcher.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.794
Good ol' Aunt Belle.
How the hell is she?

07:52.872 --> 07:56.330
She's deceased, Mr. Fletcher.
Oh. I guess she could be better.

07:56.409 --> 08:00.277
- You're a hard man to find.
- I was touring with the Stones. What can I do for you?

08:00.346 --> 08:02.211
Didn't you get my message?
No.

08:02.281 --> 08:05.114
I'm the executor of your aunt's
will and as such I can inform you...

08:05.184 --> 08:09.712
you are the major beneficiary of
your aunt's estate, Belle Isle.

08:09.789 --> 08:13.350
What about this expense... $58
for leg waxing? That's bullshit.

08:13.426 --> 08:15.758
Yeah, but feel how smooth
they are.

08:15.828 --> 08:19.059
It consists of 80 acres
of old plantation property.

08:19.131 --> 08:22.191
Wait a minute. Did you say
plantation? Yes, indeed.

08:22.268 --> 08:24.793
She left it to me? According
to her will, she did.

08:24.871 --> 08:28.363
- Can I get back to you?
- Hair by Ziggy? Who's Ziggy?

08:28.441 --> 08:33.207
5-0-4... Shut up, Frank. Yeah.
I'll get right back to you.

08:33.279 --> 08:36.248
Can't we just return some of these
things? What about the lingerie?

08:36.315 --> 08:39.284
- I ate it.
- Be serious for one minute.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.979
I quit.

08:41.053 --> 08:46.252
I'm not unreasonable about
legitimate expenses. I quit, Frank.

08:46.325 --> 08:49.783
Yeah. On the sewer story, I'm gonna
advance you for the hip boots and wet suit.

08:49.862 --> 08:52.422
Frank, I'm really quitting.

08:52.498 --> 08:56.457
Fletch, look, I got a little
A-frame up at Arrowhead.

08:56.536 --> 08:59.004
Why don't you go there, take
a couple of weeks, relax?

08:59.071 --> 09:01.767
I'm really gonna miss you.

09:01.841 --> 09:03.775
Maybe that's an overstatement.

09:03.843 --> 09:07.074
Treat this as good news. You can
always write my Jane Doe column.

09:07.146 --> 09:09.774
You're not gonna quit,
and I'll tell you why.

09:09.849 --> 09:12.079
Why? You have journalistic integrity.

09:12.151 --> 09:15.018
Yeah. And you have a sense of loyalty.

09:15.087 --> 09:17.248
And you'll never give up the
quest for truth, will you?

09:17.323 --> 09:22.955
You're right. I can't abandon the principles
that nurtured me lo these many years.

09:23.029 --> 09:27.363
Wrap them up with the shit on my desk and
have them shipped to my mansion in Louisiana.

09:27.433 --> 09:29.833
Bye.

09:29.902 --> 09:31.836
What happened?

09:32.071 --> 09:35.336
And my husband said I was crazy to
go 2,000 miles to have my nose done.

09:37.810 --> 09:41.871
That's an interesting watch.
Is it a prize of some sort?

09:41.948 --> 09:45.975
No. It certainly looks like one.

09:47.053 --> 09:49.146
It's a championship
Laker watch.

09:49.221 --> 09:51.712
Oh! Are you a Laker?

09:51.791 --> 09:57.423
I used to date one. Only thing
I have to remember him by.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.864
Lord, what was that?

10:06.939 --> 10:10.670
We just clipped a Piper Cub. The
pilot's okay. I just saw him parachuting.

10:13.145 --> 10:16.137
I love a man
with a sense of humor.

10:16.215 --> 10:19.241
What did you say
your name was?

10:19.318 --> 10:21.377
Nostradamus.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.684
I'm Cindy Mae Sample.

10:23.756 --> 10:27.715
Nostradamus.
I love the Fightin' Irish.

10:27.793 --> 10:31.729
Lord, I hate to fly. I wish I was
gettin' off in Thibodaux like you.

10:31.797 --> 10:36.530
It's two more stops to Selma. All
those ups and downs and ups and downs.

10:38.137 --> 10:42.369
You should try
holding your breath.

10:42.441 --> 10:44.636
Sometimes that works.

10:49.382 --> 10:51.748
Belle Isle.

10:53.219 --> 10:56.677
% We are calling%

10:56.756 --> 10:59.850

11:08.200 --> 11:10.293

11:23.616 --> 11:26.483
Thank you, Betty Lee.

11:26.552 --> 11:31.546
Look, Colonel, the folks
have come to serenade you.

11:31.624 --> 11:33.922
They love you so much.

11:33.993 --> 11:36.928
I love them too.

11:36.996 --> 11:40.329
Give me that, boy!

11:46.205 --> 11:48.799
Thank you, sir.
Quiet down.

11:48.874 --> 11:51.069
- Uncle Frank?
- Yes, sir?

11:51.143 --> 11:55.637
- You know my favorite tune.
- Sure do, Colonel.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.843
Would you mind if I sat
in your lap, Colonel?

11:58.918 --> 12:01.751
Please do, Betty Lee.
Please do.

12:01.821 --> 12:07.589
The field hands would like to
dance for you. Dance for me?

12:07.660 --> 12:10.151
Why, I'll dance for them!

12:10.229 --> 12:16.065
Yes, sir! % Zip-a-dee-doo-dah

13:00.446 --> 13:02.573
You made it,
Mr. Notre Dame.

13:08.654 --> 13:12.556
Mr. Fletcher.
I'm Amanda Ray Ross.

13:12.625 --> 13:16.493
I spoke with you on the
phone. Oh, yes. That was you?

13:16.562 --> 13:18.587
Great.

13:18.664 --> 13:21.758
Do you have any luggage?
Just one piece.

13:33.679 --> 13:36.170
Plannin' on stayin' long?

13:36.248 --> 13:40.344
Just long enough to see Mount Rushmore
and squeeze in a little ice fishing.

13:44.023 --> 13:46.548
I'm on the board of
the Pontchartrain Society.

13:46.625 --> 13:49.958
We help preserve and restore
some of these lovely mansions.

13:56.302 --> 13:57.894
We headed to Belle Isle?

13:57.970 --> 14:01.599
- You must be dying to see it, Mr. Fletcher.
- Call me Fletch.

14:01.674 --> 14:05.337
Your house is not quite as grand as
some of the others in the neighborhood.

14:05.411 --> 14:09.142
It doesn't matter. It's the thought
that counts. Eighty acres, huh?

14:09.215 --> 14:12.946
Mm-hmm.
Isn't it strikin'?

14:16.222 --> 14:20.158
Your aunt tried to keep things
in their natural state.

14:20.226 --> 14:22.820
She ever brush her hair?

14:24.463 --> 14:27.626
- I can see you're disappointed.
- No, not at all!

14:27.700 --> 14:32.069
A little spackling and some napalm,
this place would make a nice mausoleum.

14:44.183 --> 14:46.481
Oh, my God!
Are you all right?

14:46.552 --> 14:51.182
Oh! I was aimin' to fix
that today. How do you do?

14:51.257 --> 14:54.124
I be Calculus Entterby.
You be Mr. And Mrs. Fletcher?

14:54.193 --> 14:59.688
I be Fletch. Geometry Fletch.
She be Miss Trigonometry Ross.

14:59.765 --> 15:04.202
Pleased, I'm sure. Your Aunt Belle
told me you'd be takin' over the place,

15:04.270 --> 15:06.500
and I'm extendin'
my "condulations."

15:08.741 --> 15:10.709
Right. You work here?

15:10.776 --> 15:13.404
Your Aunt Belle and I,
we had an arrangement.

15:13.479 --> 15:17.381
And I was hopin' we could
make an extenuation of it.

15:17.449 --> 15:21.681
Help me get your stuff
out the car here. Come on.

15:23.489 --> 15:25.423
You mind your step.

15:25.491 --> 15:27.652
Our families go back
for hundreds of years.

15:27.726 --> 15:32.993
Your great grandparents owned my great
grandparents and that's how it all started.

15:33.065 --> 15:35.056
Did you ever hear of the
Emancipation Proclamation?

15:36.735 --> 15:39.863
I heard somethin' about it,
but I don't recall exactly.

15:39.939 --> 15:44.239
- It didn't get much publicity around these here parts.
- I'll bet.

15:44.310 --> 15:46.574
Excuse me, sir.

15:46.645 --> 15:51.582
Could you give me a hand?
R-Right here.

15:51.650 --> 15:53.982
Just pull it towards you.
Just pull it.

15:54.053 --> 15:57.045
Come on, come on.
Just pull it.

15:57.122 --> 15:59.386
Just pull it on over.
That's it, that's it.

15:59.458 --> 16:01.392
Don't scar the car.

16:01.460 --> 16:04.190
Is there any electricity
or gas?

16:04.263 --> 16:08.165
Everything works.
No cable TV, I guess.

16:08.233 --> 16:13.000
If I'd known you was comin', I'd have straightened
out a bit and stocked your refrigerator.

16:13.072 --> 16:16.098
No food?
No refrigerator.

16:16.175 --> 16:19.201
We need to do some paperwork.
Want a lift into town?

16:19.278 --> 16:22.770
What? And leave my estate unattended?
It's not yours till you sign.

16:22.848 --> 16:26.648
I can make you some dinner,
ease the culture shock.

16:26.719 --> 16:28.846
That sounds great.

16:28.921 --> 16:32.084
Should I be doin' anything?
No, not really.

16:32.157 --> 16:35.251
Uh, soon as you get that trunk
upstairs and have finished your nap,

16:35.327 --> 16:39.491
I guess you could fix that step and jump
down, turn around and pick a bale of cotton.

16:39.565 --> 16:43.558
And while I'm gone, see to it Miss Scarlett
stays away from the Union Army, will you?

16:47.606 --> 16:49.904
More wine?

16:49.975 --> 16:52.443
You're not trying to take
advantage of me, are you?

16:52.511 --> 16:56.106
Not yet.
You need to sign these papers.

16:59.251 --> 17:01.412
Do you mind
if I read 'em first?

17:01.487 --> 17:05.719
Be my guest. Had you talked
to your aunt recently?

17:05.790 --> 17:10.387
That depends on your view of
history. It's been 16 years.

17:11.896 --> 17:14.229
Sign all three?
Please.

17:14.299 --> 17:18.166
I was just wonderin' because she changed
her will three weeks before she died.

17:19.704 --> 17:23.003
Well, lucky for me.
Why'd she do that?

17:23.075 --> 17:27.340
I don't know. She was old. Seemed
to be under a lot of strain.

17:29.681 --> 17:33.412
Dying always does that to you.

17:33.485 --> 17:38.149
Congratulations. You know, you can make
yourself some good money out of this.

17:38.223 --> 17:42.819
A Realtor contacted me with an
unusually high offer... 225,000.

17:42.895 --> 17:45.591
- Dollars?
- Mm-hmm.

17:45.664 --> 17:48.531
Let me ask you this:

17:48.600 --> 17:52.798
If they're so anxious, don't you think if
I wait a little longer, they might go up?

17:52.871 --> 17:56.170
- They might.
- And I just got here, didn't I?

17:56.241 --> 17:58.038
No sale?

18:01.080 --> 18:04.811
While you're thinking about it, what
are you gonna do with the land, Fletch?

18:04.883 --> 18:09.377
I don't know. Raise chitlins... the
chitlin' market as high as it is.

18:09.455 --> 18:13.551
They're mean little animals, but
their coats are worth a fortune.

18:15.094 --> 18:20.122
$225,000?
What do you think I oughta do?

18:20.199 --> 18:26.001
If I were you, I would
proceed slowly and carefully.

18:26.071 --> 18:28.733
That's my specialty.

18:28.807 --> 18:33.176
- Would you like some dessert?
- What do you have in mind?

18:33.245 --> 18:37.238
How 'bout something sweet...
and Southern?

19:17.356 --> 19:19.449
I borrowed your toothbrush.

19:19.525 --> 19:23.586
Would've used your razor, but it looks like
you've been doing some gardening with it.

19:25.330 --> 19:29.391
Gee, I can't believe
we slept this late.

19:29.468 --> 19:33.962
Amanda? Want to drive
into Belle Isle?

19:38.677 --> 19:40.668
I guess not.

19:48.587 --> 19:51.147
It was good,
but not that good.

19:54.326 --> 19:59.389
'Morning, Mr. Fletcher. If that's
your real name. I'm Billy Jo Hendrick.

19:59.464 --> 20:02.126
Howdy.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.465
What's your relationship
to Amanda Ray?

20:04.536 --> 20:06.800
She was my attorney.

20:06.872 --> 20:10.467
She was working on my briefs.

20:10.542 --> 20:14.342
- You come into town, y'all just hit it off?
- So to speak.

20:14.413 --> 20:18.975
Sparks just flew. That's
what you're gonna tell me.

20:19.051 --> 20:21.645
Wonder why things like that
never happen to me?

20:21.720 --> 20:24.245
Wonder why!

20:26.225 --> 20:30.423
Were y'all usin' some drugs you brought
in from California by any chance?

20:30.495 --> 20:33.293
Just some Beaujolais.

20:33.365 --> 20:35.856
Beaujolais?

20:35.934 --> 20:38.596
It's a pretty popular drug
made from grapes?

20:38.670 --> 20:41.468
- You feel like makin' a statement?
- A statement?

20:45.077 --> 20:48.342
"Ask not what your country can do for
you, ask what you can do for your country."

20:48.413 --> 20:51.280
I guess you just wanna make
it hard on everybody.

20:51.350 --> 20:56.879
Well, let's see how you feel after
some time in the tank. Y'all come.

20:56.955 --> 20:58.889
All of us?
Just you.

20:58.957 --> 21:02.358
- What's the charge?
- Pissin' me off.

21:02.427 --> 21:04.793
Is that a felony or a
misdemeanor? That's it!

21:08.233 --> 21:11.999
You're cleaner than most
of the ones we get around here.

21:12.070 --> 21:16.564
You smell nice.
I expect you'll be popular.

21:16.642 --> 21:18.803
Do you realize you have
to read me my rights?

21:18.877 --> 21:22.313
Or at least find someone who
can read to do it for you.

21:27.619 --> 21:31.919
A little gamy in here.
Not much ventilation, huh?

21:33.225 --> 21:35.159
How's the chow?

21:43.735 --> 21:48.195
You know, you really shouldn't wear so
much eye makeup. It makes you look cheap.

21:48.273 --> 21:50.935
You're sittin' on my bunk.

21:51.009 --> 21:53.569
Sorry.
Shut up!

21:57.649 --> 21:59.583
Take your pants off.

22:03.255 --> 22:06.281
Ah, I don't even know
your name.

22:06.358 --> 22:08.451
Bend over.

22:08.527 --> 22:11.587
Ben? Nice to meet you.
Victor Hugo.

22:11.663 --> 22:15.599
You wouldn't happen to have a middle name,
would you? Everybody else here seems to.

22:15.667 --> 22:19.728
- What are you in for, Ben?
- Molesting a dead horse.

22:19.805 --> 22:23.297
Ooh, there's no crime in that.

22:23.375 --> 22:27.368
That's your right as an American.
I'm tryin' to cut down myself.

22:27.446 --> 22:31.906
His missus hit him on the head with a ball
pein hammer whilst he was eatin' sausage...

22:31.983 --> 22:35.578
and almost choked him
to death.

22:35.654 --> 22:41.149
Okay, beautiful, let's hope another long
night in the tank has sobered you up.

22:44.796 --> 22:47.128
Ben?

22:47.199 --> 22:50.635
If I don't hear from you on Valentine's
Day, I'll be very disappointed.

22:55.073 --> 22:58.236
Mr. Johnson, I'm surprised
to see you here.

22:58.310 --> 23:02.303
Judge Watkins usually assigns
these small potatoes to Billy Ray.

23:02.381 --> 23:07.250
Well, he's on vacation. This is the price
I pay for the proximity of my office.

23:07.319 --> 23:09.583
Excuse me. Sir?

23:09.654 --> 23:12.714
You don't have a card,
do you? Or a price list?

23:12.791 --> 23:16.557
Well, matter of fact,
I do.

23:17.829 --> 23:20.992
I'm Hamilton Johnson.
I'm an attorney at law.

23:21.066 --> 23:25.025
You take other cases or you just
specialize in transvestite necrophiliacs?

23:25.103 --> 23:27.571
Not enough evidence
to hold you.

23:27.639 --> 23:32.599
Just a petty form of intimidation putting
you in a cell with that Neanderthal.

23:32.677 --> 23:36.306
She wasn't so bad. If she'd just
fix up her hair and shave her back.

23:36.381 --> 23:40.909
It's so embarrassin', this sort of
thing still goes on in the New South.

23:40.986 --> 23:46.424
'Course, 20 years ago a Yankee like
you could've been lyin' in the ditch.

23:46.491 --> 23:49.119
I'm assumin', of course,

23:49.194 --> 23:53.096
that you had nothin' whatsoever
to do with the death of Amanda Ray.

23:53.165 --> 23:56.464
Sure hope not.
Hop in.

23:56.535 --> 23:59.436
I was shocked
to hear about this.

23:59.504 --> 24:01.438
She was such
a dear friend.

24:01.506 --> 24:03.440
So tragic...

24:03.508 --> 24:07.740
when this happens to
somebody so young and healthy.

24:07.813 --> 24:11.476
Was she feelin' all right last
night? She felt great to me.

24:11.550 --> 24:15.748
Just smell that soft
Southern air.

24:15.821 --> 24:20.758
It's so sad to see this
beautiful pastoral countryside...

24:20.826 --> 24:25.092
blighted by the greed of a few men
in pursuit of the almighty dollar.

24:25.163 --> 24:28.030
That's my place
over there.

24:28.099 --> 24:32.399
The trees just beyond it screen off the
Bibleland Amusement Park in the daytime,

24:32.471 --> 24:34.701
but at night, they do make
a hell of a racket.

24:41.580 --> 24:45.607
- Thanks for everything, Hamilton.
- Most welcome. Just call me Ham.

24:47.085 --> 24:49.781
Ham, call me Fletch.

24:49.855 --> 24:54.554
All right, Fletch.
Anything I can do to help ya.

24:55.760 --> 24:57.853
Fletch!

24:57.929 --> 25:00.921
- Might I give you some personal advice?
- Is it free?

25:00.999 --> 25:05.299
To the sheriff and his sort
of people, you're an outsider.

25:05.370 --> 25:07.702
Guilty in spite of the law.

25:07.772 --> 25:10.707
Should I get outta town
before sundown?

25:10.775 --> 25:13.369
It's not that bad, but...

25:13.445 --> 25:17.142
if I were you,
lookin' for peace and quiet...

25:17.215 --> 25:20.810
Well, they can make it
a might uncomfortable for ya.

25:20.886 --> 25:23.821
It's gonna take time.
Thanks, Ham.

25:23.889 --> 25:26.016
Bye.

25:26.091 --> 25:28.116
My pleasure.

25:28.193 --> 25:31.253
Anything I can do for ya.

25:48.580 --> 25:53.779
Welcome back. I thought you run
off for good. Does this car run?

25:53.852 --> 25:58.846
Yeah, but Miss Belle stopped
drivin' it when the brakes ran out.

25:58.924 --> 26:01.791
I run a few errands
from time to time,

26:01.860 --> 26:04.852
but if you wanna stop it,
you got to think ahead.

26:06.431 --> 26:11.130
Hmm. I finally got the place
straightened out for you.

26:11.202 --> 26:14.171
Mm-hmm. When was that?
Back in 1970?

26:14.239 --> 26:19.677
Your Aunt Belle, she lived in this
one room. Didn't take up much space.

26:19.744 --> 26:21.678
Calculus?
Hmm?

26:21.746 --> 26:24.010
You don't see
a spider, do you?

26:25.684 --> 26:31.486
Spiders is good. They eats the
cockroaches. Yeah, sure they do.

26:31.556 --> 26:33.990
Mister Owl.

26:34.059 --> 26:37.517
This is more like it. This
is what I came here for.

26:37.596 --> 26:41.157
Yes, sir.
Peace and quiet.

26:41.232 --> 26:45.896
Scum, scum, scum.!
Go back to where you come.!

26:45.971 --> 26:48.963
- Friends of yours?
- Nothin' to me.

26:49.040 --> 26:51.634
"The loyal sons of the...

26:51.710 --> 26:55.612
Buford, where's the cross.
Did you bring the cross?

26:55.680 --> 27:00.777
"White race will not allow
any kind of alien infection...

27:01.953 --> 27:04.251
to invade our beloved land."

27:06.157 --> 27:11.390
Scum, scum, scum.
Go back to where you come.

27:11.463 --> 27:15.900
Let's do it together.
Scum, scum, scum. Go back...

27:15.967 --> 27:19.903
Get the hell outta here
and go home! Scum! Pigs!

27:19.971 --> 27:21.905
Sorry I'm late.

27:21.973 --> 27:25.067
Who goes there?
Henry Himmler.

27:25.143 --> 27:28.408
What klavan claims you?
California klavan, Cucamonga.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.414
California?

27:30.482 --> 27:33.747
Yeah. I was passing through town and was
lookin' for something to do this evening.

27:33.818 --> 27:36.286
There was nothing goin' on at the
Rotary Club. I heard about this.

27:36.354 --> 27:39.187
Welcome, Henry.
I'm the Grand Kleagle.

27:39.257 --> 27:41.191
Oh.

27:46.998 --> 27:50.297
California thing.
Pig-faced scum!

27:50.368 --> 27:55.601
What's the occasion here? Oh, some
undesirable carpetbagger... I think.

27:55.674 --> 28:01.306
Damn! Boys, I just got a closer
peek. There's nobody in there.

28:01.379 --> 28:05.577
We're wasting our time.

28:09.554 --> 28:14.116
- And I washed all these sheets.!
- Wh-Who's this?

28:14.192 --> 28:18.288
Oh. Sorry. Hi, fellas. Hank Himmler.

28:18.363 --> 28:20.228
Hi, Hank.

28:20.298 --> 28:25.497
The cross won't burn, nobody home.
Hell, it ain't like it used to be.

28:25.570 --> 28:28.004
You said it.

28:28.073 --> 28:33.136
I couldn't get more than 13 guys out here
tonight. Five of them are green recruits.

28:33.211 --> 28:35.543
Kinda stand-ins, you
know what I mean? Yeah.

28:35.613 --> 28:38.912
We call 'em Klookies.
Klookies?

28:38.983 --> 28:43.784
That's good! Of course,
it's just a contract job.

28:43.855 --> 28:45.789
Yeah.
Contract job?

28:45.857 --> 28:49.918
Yeah.! We've been havin' a terrible
time down here. We've had to rent out.

28:56.167 --> 28:58.362
Here I come!

29:00.739 --> 29:03.833
Gene Hackman, kick your ass.

29:03.908 --> 29:06.035
They're speakin' some kind
of African dialect!

29:13.585 --> 29:15.519
Hi.

29:33.538 --> 29:35.472
'Morning.

29:35.540 --> 29:38.031
- Mr. Fletcher?
- As far as you know.

29:38.109 --> 29:40.839
I'm Becky Ann Culpepper.
Thibodaux Realty.

29:40.912 --> 29:45.940
I'd offer you some coffee and eggs
Benedict, but we're all out of Benedict.

29:46.017 --> 29:47.644
Thanks.
I've already eaten.

29:47.719 --> 29:50.210
What can I do to...
for you?

29:50.288 --> 29:55.316
Mr. Fletcher, you may have heard that there's
a party interested in acquiring your property.

29:55.393 --> 29:57.691
A substantial offer.

29:59.097 --> 30:01.691
How substantial?

30:01.766 --> 30:03.825
$250,000.

30:03.902 --> 30:07.429
Whew!
I don't know.

30:07.505 --> 30:10.440
I had big plans for this place.

30:10.508 --> 30:13.568
Mini mall with a yogurt bar
and a tanning parlor.

30:13.645 --> 30:16.876
Well, Mr. Fletcher,
all I know is $250,000...

30:16.948 --> 30:20.850
is a mighty generous price
for land in this area.

30:20.919 --> 30:25.015
Who's your client?
I'm not at liberty to say.

30:25.089 --> 30:27.922
Well, then I'm not
at liberty to sell.

30:27.992 --> 30:29.960
This is a tremendous
opportunity.

30:30.028 --> 30:34.226
I'll tell you what. I'll consult with
my people who will contact their people,

30:34.299 --> 30:36.426
and they'll get in touch
with your people.

30:36.501 --> 30:38.799
Who are your people?

30:38.870 --> 30:43.398
- Who are yours?
- As I said, I have to keep that confidential.

30:43.474 --> 30:48.537
Very well. I'll just have my people
contact each other. Keep 'em busy.

30:48.613 --> 30:51.810
All right. Well, just keep
me in mind. Here's my card.

30:51.883 --> 30:53.817
Oh, I'll keep you in mind.

30:55.053 --> 30:57.078
Hope we can do this again
sometime soon.

30:58.223 --> 31:00.316
In about 10 minutes?

31:09.367 --> 31:13.201
That night I decided to return
to the scene of the crime.

31:13.271 --> 31:17.173
It gave me a chance to check out my new
car and practice my parallel parking.

31:27.151 --> 31:30.678
So far the only really good
suspect in Amanda's death was me,

31:30.755 --> 31:34.156
and I was pretty sure
that I didn't do it.

31:34.225 --> 31:37.558
Amanda knew more than she'd let on,
but the only clue she'd left me...

31:37.629 --> 31:41.497
was a reference to Aunt Belle
changing her will just before she died.

31:43.301 --> 31:46.600
I knew the local police force was
watching her place carefully...

31:46.671 --> 31:49.504
so there'd be no trouble
getting in.

31:49.574 --> 31:53.510
Over the years I found Mr. Underhill's
credit card to be a useful tool...

31:53.578 --> 31:55.842
much like Underhill himself.

32:09.928 --> 32:13.728
As usual, I was willing to risk my life
just to get a peek into a filing cabinet.

32:13.798 --> 32:18.235
I love them when they're unlocked, neatly
organized and tell me what I wanna know.

32:18.303 --> 32:20.635
Belle's legal files
were in good order...

32:20.705 --> 32:23.674
with the exception of something missing
under the heading of "Bluebird. '"

32:26.311 --> 32:28.802
My aunt had almost left
Belle Isle to some minister.

32:28.880 --> 32:32.907
Obviously at one time
he must have touched her deeply.

32:32.984 --> 32:35.851
Since she changed her mind, I guess
he didn't touch her deeply enough...

32:35.920 --> 32:37.854
or in the right place.

32:44.495 --> 32:48.226
Thank you very much. Couldn't
find that light switch.

32:48.299 --> 32:52.599
What the hell you doin' here? This is a
restricted area. Didn't you see the sign?

32:52.670 --> 32:57.039
Signs? Signs! That's all I
see is signs. Look at this.

32:57.108 --> 33:00.942
Stressed out "dormants" on the windows, walls
that are deplaning to an alarming degree.

33:01.012 --> 33:04.846
Deplaning? This house is obviously
infested with reticulermes Mario Cuomos.

33:04.916 --> 33:07.384
What's that?
What's what?

33:07.452 --> 33:10.421
Reticulermes. You can't even
say it yourself.

33:10.488 --> 33:13.616
They are deadly African
microscopic termites.

33:13.691 --> 33:17.218
They can eat a hundred times
their weight in five minutes.

33:17.295 --> 33:19.661
Much like yourself. From the
look of things, I'd say...

33:19.731 --> 33:22.359
this place is about ready
to collapse. Who are you?

33:22.433 --> 33:26.062
Billie Jean King, Bug Busters.
My van is parked out front.

33:26.137 --> 33:28.833
Mr. King, I don't know nothin'
about no Bug Busters.

33:28.906 --> 33:33.206
The surgeon general was right.
They've been mighty busy here.

33:35.446 --> 33:39.348
The only time you can
catch 'em is at night.

33:41.219 --> 33:44.450
Aha! I got one!
See that?

33:44.522 --> 33:48.083
These little buggers are the
piranhas of the insect world.

33:48.159 --> 33:50.753
The only thing they like better
than wood is human flesh. Really?

33:50.828 --> 33:53.456
You bet. If you can't see it,
how do you know you got one?

33:53.531 --> 33:57.729
I'm glad I asked that question. They
make this horrible high-pitched noise.

33:57.802 --> 34:02.136
It's kinda like a tiny little
scream. Can you hear that?

34:02.206 --> 34:05.073
Can you hear that? It's
like a tiny little piglet.

34:05.143 --> 34:09.239
No? Uh-oh. I seem to have
dropped it in your ear. You what?

34:09.313 --> 34:11.246
That's all right.

34:11.315 --> 34:16.150
We better get that. Can't let that nest
in there. They multiply by masturbation.

34:16.219 --> 34:19.212
The only way to get that out is to
get as close to the floor as you can.

34:19.290 --> 34:22.726
Go on down to the floor. That's right.
They're drawn to the floorboards.

34:22.793 --> 34:25.592
Now shake your head like you're
trying to get water out of your ear.

34:25.663 --> 34:29.496
That's good. But hit it... No, hit
it harder. This side. That's right.

34:29.567 --> 34:33.196
Now make that scream. That'll
draw 'em out. Squeal like a pig.

34:33.271 --> 34:36.138
A little higher.
Hey, I found the queen!

34:36.206 --> 34:39.574
I found the queen! I don't believe
it. No one's ever found a queen.

34:39.643 --> 34:42.168
I gotta get this to the lab
and get a stool sample.

34:52.924 --> 34:56.826
After my close call with Miss
Piggy, I couldn't wait to get home.

34:56.893 --> 34:58.885
My head was filled
with decorating ideas.

34:58.963 --> 35:03.161
I didn't have a lot of money, but I
could move the pool closer to the house.

35:09.073 --> 35:13.134
I could see I wasn't gonna get
much privacy.

35:55.486 --> 35:58.080
- Who's there?
- It's Avon calling.

35:59.257 --> 36:01.054
Oh.! It's you.!

36:01.125 --> 36:05.789
- I'd like to talk to you for a minute.
- Yeah, come on in.

36:05.863 --> 36:08.229
Come on in. Have a seat.
Make yourself at home.

36:08.299 --> 36:12.565
What's on your mind?

36:12.637 --> 36:14.867
Well...

36:17.175 --> 36:19.575
What do you do?
Mud wrestle in this thing?

36:19.644 --> 36:22.374
I'm sorry about that,
but I won it in a raffle.

36:22.446 --> 36:27.884
Must be an art to sitting
in one of these. Lost art.

36:27.952 --> 36:31.080
You get the Lakers? I'm lucky
if I can get Wheel of Fortune.

36:31.155 --> 36:34.147
Do you know any reason why somebody
would want to buy this land?

36:34.225 --> 36:36.159
Insect research.

36:36.227 --> 36:38.787
Boston two-and-a-halfback
of the Yankees.

36:38.863 --> 36:40.797
I have an offer
for $250,000.

36:40.865 --> 36:46.394
Take the money and run!
What you thinkin'?

36:46.470 --> 36:49.564
What do you know about
this Farnsworth Ministry?

36:49.640 --> 36:54.407
Jimmy Lee Farnsworth? Down
here everybody knows about him.

36:54.478 --> 36:57.709
Your Aunt Belle used to
watch him when she was laid up.

36:57.782 --> 37:01.240
...And that is
have you've been saved?

37:03.154 --> 37:06.783
I know that there are a lot
of you out there tonight...

37:06.857 --> 37:11.954
that the devil has got a good, firm grip
around your neck and is choking you to death.!

37:12.029 --> 37:13.758
Amen!

37:13.831 --> 37:16.322
I want you to send
whatever you can afford.

37:16.400 --> 37:18.698
If you've got a thousand
dollars in the bank,

37:18.769 --> 37:21.932
don't be afraid to send
the whole thousand dollars.

37:22.006 --> 37:26.033
I need your money. Bibleland
is only halfway there.

37:26.110 --> 37:29.705
Bible... land.
The most important attraction...

37:29.780 --> 37:32.010
since the crucifixion
itself.

37:32.083 --> 37:34.608
Immediate seating
for the 5:00 service.

37:34.685 --> 37:37.153
The 5:00 service
is about to begin.

37:37.221 --> 37:39.985
Immediate seating
for the 5:00 service.

37:40.057 --> 37:43.185
Welcome, sinner.
Praise the Lord!

37:43.261 --> 37:46.924
Bless you, bless her, bless
him. Hallelujah! Name please.

37:46.998 --> 37:51.059
Irwin Fletcher. Irwin M.
Fletcher. Irwin Mahatma Fletcher.

37:51.135 --> 37:53.069
Address.
Seven.

37:53.137 --> 37:56.334
It's time
for the 4,323rd edition...

37:56.407 --> 37:59.706
of the Farnsworth
Television Ministry with...

37:59.777 --> 38:03.144
Mimsy Carlyle,
God's own songbird.

38:03.214 --> 38:06.581
The heavenly feet
of Damon Feather.

38:08.085 --> 38:11.816
Mr. Coco.
The Ringfield Revivalists.

38:11.889 --> 38:15.882
The Bradley Family Singers
and Ted Medly and the band.

38:15.960 --> 38:21.159
And now, the host of our show, the
ministry's founder and your friend...

38:21.232 --> 38:26.260
Mr. Good News himself, the
Reverend Jimmy Lee Farnsworth.

38:37.448 --> 38:42.215
I know that there is someone
out there tonight...

38:42.286 --> 38:45.687
who needs to step forward.

38:45.756 --> 38:47.690
Lyda Pearl Shindley.

38:47.758 --> 38:49.385
Me?

38:49.460 --> 38:54.056
Lyda Pearl, come on down here.! Give her
a big hand, folks.! Make her welcome.!

38:54.131 --> 38:56.929
All right.!

38:59.303 --> 39:01.737
Bless you.
God bless you.

39:03.441 --> 39:07.741
I know that you suffered a terrible
tragedy when you lost Jo Bob...

39:07.812 --> 39:11.976
in the merry-go-round accident
at the State Fair. I did.

39:12.049 --> 39:16.042
I also know that Jo Bob
left you financially stable.

39:16.120 --> 39:18.054
But answer me
this one question.

39:18.122 --> 39:22.388
Has all of them riches
brung you happiness, child?

39:22.460 --> 39:24.894
No, they haven't.
I've sinned.

39:24.962 --> 39:27.590
We've all sinned.

39:27.665 --> 39:31.499
I know, but
I've really sinned.

39:31.569 --> 39:34.902
Please, God,
have her not mention my name.

39:34.972 --> 39:38.840
Say it aloud so your soul
might be cleansed.

39:38.909 --> 39:43.005
I'm so ashamed. I slept with
my best friend's husband.

39:43.080 --> 39:46.948
You are forgiven. Praise the Lord. Amen!

39:47.017 --> 39:51.750
- And I also slept with my Uncle James.
- You are forgiven, child.

39:51.822 --> 39:55.883
Ladies and gentlemen, doesn't it
take a tremendous amount of courage...

39:55.960 --> 39:59.396
to come up here on
nationwide cable hookup...

39:59.463 --> 40:02.364
and confess
to human frailties?

40:02.433 --> 40:06.494
And I also shoplifted this blouse
and... You've been forgiven.

40:06.570 --> 40:08.800
Demons out!

40:08.873 --> 40:12.138
Praise be.! Praise the Lord.!

40:12.209 --> 40:17.943
- Ladies and gentlemen, praise be, praise the Lord.
- Bravo!

40:18.015 --> 40:21.314
Surely Lyda Pearl
was not alone.

40:21.385 --> 40:25.913
Surely there is someone else out
there whose life is full of confusion.

40:25.990 --> 40:29.289
Irwin M. Fletcher just inherited
Belle Isle. I sense grief.

40:29.360 --> 40:32.625
I sense deep grief
and loneliness.

40:32.696 --> 40:35.893
I sense
a recent bereavement.

40:35.966 --> 40:39.868
Someone who has lost
an uncle or an aunt.

40:39.937 --> 40:42.497
Mr. Fletcher.

40:44.108 --> 40:48.477
- Mr. Irwin M. Fletcher.
- That's me.

40:48.546 --> 40:50.980
Are you out there?
Step forward, young man.

40:51.048 --> 40:54.848
The Lord's calling to you. Come
on up here. Give him a big hand.

40:54.919 --> 40:58.821
Make him welcome.
Come on down here.

41:04.829 --> 41:09.732
Your Aunt Belle recently passed away,
didn't she, son? Yes, she did. Yeah.

41:09.800 --> 41:14.100
Are you still grieving
in your heart, son?

41:14.171 --> 41:16.139
Absolutely.

41:16.207 --> 41:20.166
And even her generous gift
to ya of the ancestral home,

41:20.244 --> 41:22.178
the beautiful Belle Isle,

41:22.246 --> 41:27.878
has not eased the grief, pain and
sufferin' in your heart now, has it?

41:27.952 --> 41:30.113
Not a hell of a lot.
No.

41:30.187 --> 41:33.679
Irwin, admit
that you are a sinner.

41:36.126 --> 41:41.291
Uh, well I've sinned. Didn't
take any Polaroids or anything.

41:41.365 --> 41:44.459
But... I've sinned.
Yeah.

41:44.535 --> 41:47.470
The Lord forgives ya!

41:47.538 --> 41:51.497
Thank you. Thank you
very much. Thank you.

41:51.575 --> 41:54.203
Thank you. Amen.

41:54.278 --> 41:57.076
What? Other sins?

41:57.147 --> 42:02.278
Uh, I parked in a handicapped
spot on my way over here.

42:02.353 --> 42:04.548
Actually on
a handicapped person.

42:04.622 --> 42:08.786
I told him I'd be out in five
minutes so that's not such a big deal.

42:08.859 --> 42:14.126
There have been other things. They're
personal, so I wouldn't wanna get into it on TV.

42:14.198 --> 42:17.133
But I have sinned and I'm
sorry about it. Thanks.

42:17.201 --> 42:20.193
God forgives ya!
Amen.!

42:20.271 --> 42:23.968
The good Lord
is gonna ease...

42:24.041 --> 42:27.272
the pain and sufferin'
in your heart...

42:27.344 --> 42:29.972
with a bright light
of grace.

42:30.047 --> 42:35.280
Look out, you demons!
Demons, demons, out!

42:36.754 --> 42:39.951
Oh! That was great.

42:40.024 --> 42:42.515
Praise the Lord.

42:42.593 --> 42:46.859
Another soul saved by Jimmy
Lee Farnsworth. How about that?

42:46.931 --> 42:50.799
I dangled Belle Isle like bait in
front of Jimmy Lee and he took the hook.

42:50.868 --> 42:55.168
I could tell, at the heart, he was a
deeply religious man and I liked his teeth.

42:55.239 --> 42:57.332
Once we've had
a chance to expand,

42:57.408 --> 43:00.775
Bibleland's gonna be like
some kind of heaven on earth...

43:00.844 --> 43:03.642
if it isn't already.

43:03.714 --> 43:06.478
- There's the hotel.
- Hi, Reverend.

43:06.550 --> 43:09.519
We call it the Heavenly Hilton
and Convention Center.

43:09.587 --> 43:13.353
Beyond that is the
Farnsworth Bible College.

43:13.424 --> 43:16.393
If you look down the road, you see
the Jump for Jesus Trampoline Center.

43:16.460 --> 43:19.623
- What do you think?
- It's unbelievable.

43:19.697 --> 43:22.723
You don't suppose I use too many
photographs of myself, do ya?

43:22.800 --> 43:26.327
No! No!
It worked for the Ayatollah.

43:26.403 --> 43:29.167
Mr. Fletcher, your Belle Isle's
a bit rundown.

43:29.239 --> 43:31.799
That sucker's gonna eat
you alive in maintenance.

43:31.875 --> 43:35.174
You don't know how much your
land would mean to our ministry.

43:35.245 --> 43:39.648
And to God, too, of course. After all, he
does give us our guidance now, doesn't he?

43:39.717 --> 43:41.810
- Amen!
- You bet your ass.

43:42.453 --> 43:45.013
Like my mother used to say,
"There's a tick for every dog. '"

43:45.089 --> 43:47.023
What did your mother
mean by that?

43:47.091 --> 43:52.119
Why in God's name you let Farnsworth's
ministry burrow into your fur?

43:52.196 --> 43:57.395
Why would you even think of givin' away your
property when you got a big cash offer on it?

43:57.468 --> 44:00.164
I don't know. I guess I thought,
after a lifetime of hedonism,

44:00.237 --> 44:03.536
it was time
to rededicate my life.

44:03.607 --> 44:07.907
Nah, I just wanted to see what would
happen if I went along with him.

44:07.978 --> 44:11.675
Well, it happened.
The sheriff's office called.

44:11.749 --> 44:14.115
The charges against you
have been dropped.

44:14.184 --> 44:15.947
Is that right?
Mm-hmm.

44:16.020 --> 44:20.013
The ministry has a good deal
of influence around here.

44:20.090 --> 44:22.786
I suppose you've heard
that your...

44:22.860 --> 44:28.196
aunt was under considerable emotional
strain in the weeks before she died?

44:28.265 --> 44:31.132
Yeah, I've heard that.

44:31.201 --> 44:33.931
So was my mother.

44:34.004 --> 44:37.405
They took advantage of her.
These Holy Rollers.

44:37.474 --> 44:42.138
When she was at death's door, they
preyed on her faith and her fear.

44:42.212 --> 44:44.578
When she was no longer able
to make rational decisions,

44:44.648 --> 44:48.311
persuaded her to give away our
land for that amusement park.

44:48.385 --> 44:52.788
My guess is that your speedy
conversion and your promised gift...

44:52.856 --> 44:57.122
played no small part in the
charges against you being dropped.

45:00.764 --> 45:02.664
Well, whatever.

45:02.733 --> 45:05.668
At least I'm off the hook.

45:05.736 --> 45:09.729
And who or what do they think is
responsible for Amanda Ray's death?

45:09.807 --> 45:12.105
The autopsy report
come in today.

45:12.176 --> 45:15.668
They said she died of a
heart attack. Natural causes.

45:15.746 --> 45:18.909
Either she had
some congenital defect...

45:18.982 --> 45:22.975
or... you're one
hell of a lover.

45:25.022 --> 45:26.956
Probably both.

45:27.024 --> 45:32.690
I needed more background on Farnsworth
so I called Frank for a favor.

45:32.763 --> 45:35.857
Maybe I should've asked him
to check out Calculus Entterby.

45:35.933 --> 45:39.061
I liked him, but I wasn't buying
his Amos and Andy routine.

45:39.136 --> 45:41.400
He seemed a lot smarter
than that.

45:41.472 --> 45:45.670
I never took you to be no
murderer. That's a relief.

45:45.743 --> 45:49.509
So who's the
odds on favorite now?

45:49.580 --> 45:51.844
Nobody.

45:51.915 --> 45:54.884
They're sayin' she dropped
dead in her sleep. Yeah!

45:57.421 --> 45:59.355
The odds on that?

45:59.423 --> 46:01.983
Same as catchin' a bass
this afternoon.

46:04.194 --> 46:06.355
What's that?

46:06.430 --> 46:09.194
About 258,000 to one.

46:18.609 --> 46:20.873
You sure you
don't wanna back out?

46:20.944 --> 46:23.708
I'm in.

46:25.549 --> 46:28.416
This be the morgue?
Have the police come yet?

46:28.485 --> 46:32.922
What? The police! They was bringing
a doctor to make a death certificate.

46:32.990 --> 46:36.687
You got a stiff, boy, you're
in the right place. Where is it?

46:36.760 --> 46:39.160
In my Cadillac.

46:39.229 --> 46:42.528
Put him on the gurney. Take him
in the back with the rest of'em.

46:42.599 --> 46:45.067
Don't bother me.
I'm watchin The Terminator.

46:45.135 --> 46:47.899
You better put a steerin'wheel
on that. Excuse me, sir.

46:47.971 --> 46:50.838
I'll be right back now.

46:52.910 --> 46:57.006
- What's that stickin' out?
- His lucky golf cap.

46:57.080 --> 46:59.014
Hey.!

47:01.585 --> 47:04.713
You gotta tag his toe.

47:04.788 --> 47:08.087
- He got a name?
- Eldridge Cleaver.

47:08.158 --> 47:11.753
Take him in the back,
strip him. Hold it.

47:11.829 --> 47:16.630
Let's see what Mr. Cleaver has,
or should I say, had.

47:22.005 --> 47:24.439
Wait a minute.
Shouldn't I get that?

47:24.508 --> 47:26.476
Tell you what.
I'll make you a deal.

47:26.543 --> 47:31.446
You call me whenever you want,
I'll tell you what time it is.

47:31.515 --> 47:34.143
Now get movin!

47:40.324 --> 47:42.918
- Eldridge Cleaver.
- Shh.

47:44.228 --> 47:46.162
Good evening, Mr. Hoffa.

47:46.230 --> 47:49.757
Amanda Ross. Amanda Ross.
Five.

48:28.906 --> 48:32.034
Can I take a look?
Yeah, go on.

48:51.695 --> 48:53.390
Boo!

48:53.463 --> 48:55.954
Any mail for me?

48:56.033 --> 48:58.160
You don't have a Tic-Tac,
do you?

48:58.235 --> 49:00.169
What happened?
I black out?

49:00.237 --> 49:03.035
Did I land the plane
safely? Passengers hurt?

49:03.106 --> 49:05.006
No.
Everything's okay?

49:05.075 --> 49:06.235
Check that air-conditioning.

49:10.781 --> 49:12.715
What'd you find out, Fletch?

49:12.783 --> 49:17.618
Cremated. I wouldn't be surprised if all
the paperwork was burnt up with the body.

49:17.688 --> 49:19.656
The morgue proved to be
a dead end.

49:19.723 --> 49:22.886
But I guess it is
for most people.

49:22.960 --> 49:26.760
I had three questions. Why was
I cleared in Amanda's death?

49:26.830 --> 49:30.231
Why, if she wasn't murdered, was
the body so quickly destroyed?

49:30.300 --> 49:34.862
And finally, when it comes to stewed prunes,
are three enough or are four too many?

49:34.938 --> 49:38.533
When I got back to Belle Isle, there
was a cozy fire in the fireplace...

49:38.608 --> 49:41.099
and on the roof, on the walls
and on the porch.

49:41.178 --> 49:43.578
It was great.

49:43.647 --> 49:45.581
Think maybe I should pack.

49:45.649 --> 49:48.015
Guess you'll be movin' in
with me now. Thanks, Cal.

49:48.085 --> 49:51.543
Look at the bright side. You won't have
to bother dusting anymore. Yes, sir!

50:01.498 --> 50:04.934
Here's your diet plate.

50:05.002 --> 50:07.994
Thank you, Miss Selma. Does everything
around here come with the head still on it?

50:08.071 --> 50:12.565
- You bet, honey.
- Glad I didn't order a hamburger.

50:12.642 --> 50:15.907
I'd say grace,
but I don't wanna wake him up.

50:15.979 --> 50:18.277
Are you religious?

50:18.348 --> 50:21.943
I believe in a God that
doesn't need heavy financing.

50:22.019 --> 50:24.453
How you doin', Mr. Barbour?
How's it goin', Calculus?

50:24.521 --> 50:27.354
Fine, fine.
This here's Mr. Fletcher.

50:27.424 --> 50:30.416
He's the new owner of Belle
Isle, or whatever's left of it.

50:30.494 --> 50:33.292
Yeah, I heard about your
fire. Sorry about that.

50:33.363 --> 50:37.800
You know, you've had your share of
problems ever since you've been here.

50:37.868 --> 50:41.360
How about me and the boys showing
you some real Southern hospitality?

50:41.438 --> 50:45.465
You ever been
on a coon hunt?

50:45.542 --> 50:50.639
Now a coon hunt is like an English fox
hunt, except we cut through all the bullshit,

50:50.714 --> 50:54.377
all the fancy clothes and
music, all the beautiful women.

50:54.451 --> 50:57.614
We reduce the experience
to its essence.

50:57.687 --> 51:00.315
Yeah, a bunch of sweaty drunks
chasin' a scared animal.

51:00.390 --> 51:02.756
You're damn right.!

51:02.826 --> 51:06.057
What am I supposed to do?
The dogs do most of the work.

51:06.129 --> 51:09.690
We just follow the dogs, they
tree the coon, we get him down.

51:11.768 --> 51:13.861
This drug testing
has gone too far.

51:13.937 --> 51:16.804
Take a jolt.
Kick-a-poo joy juice?

51:16.873 --> 51:20.502
Oh, stronger than that!

51:20.577 --> 51:23.637
Whoo!
Aren't you coming?

51:23.713 --> 51:27.205
Nah, it ain't safe for a black man to
be chasin' around these woods at night...

51:27.284 --> 51:29.809
unless he be handcuffed
to a white man.

51:29.886 --> 51:33.378
I'll see you back at... my
"domiside." You want some of this?

51:43.934 --> 51:46.402
You haven't lived till
you've been on a coon hunt,

51:46.470 --> 51:49.371
and after that,
you don't want to.

51:49.439 --> 51:52.203
But it gave me a chance to
snoop around the neighborhood.

51:52.275 --> 51:56.871
The ministry seemed so hot
for all this land. Why?

51:56.947 --> 52:00.041
Maybe they just wanted a remote
spot to bury Jim and Tammy.

52:00.117 --> 52:04.451
Where the hell are we? Actually,
this is my place, or was.

52:04.521 --> 52:06.614
I ain't been on it
since I sold the sucker.

52:06.690 --> 52:11.059
This is your property over here and
that's Ham's mama's old place over there.

52:11.128 --> 52:13.187
Don't you think we oughta
catch up with the boys?

52:13.263 --> 52:16.790
Damn right. There's a couple of'em I don't
think I should leave alone with the dogs.

52:20.871 --> 52:24.329
Oh, wait up.

52:24.407 --> 52:27.774
Jesus! What happened
to my flower garden?

52:27.844 --> 52:30.039
Everything's dead!

52:30.113 --> 52:34.015
Yo, Barbour.! Rags has got a
water moccasin in his mouth.

52:34.084 --> 52:37.520
Hey, we in luck. You wanna
jerk the head off a snake?

52:37.587 --> 52:39.521
Oh, no.
I gave it up for Lent.

52:39.589 --> 52:43.548
I'm not gonna miss the fun.
Hey, guys, wait up!

54:00.303 --> 54:03.568
I never liked guns, especially
when they're pointed at me.

54:03.640 --> 54:08.077
And this night a couple of people were
taking pot shots in my general direction.

54:08.144 --> 54:10.669
It was time
to get outta there.

54:10.747 --> 54:12.874
11:27 to be exact.

54:19.723 --> 54:22.089
% Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na Na-na-na-na% %

54:25.128 --> 54:27.062
I was heartbroken to miss
the raccoon,

54:27.130 --> 54:31.897
but all I wanted was a good night's
sleep so I headed for Cal's water bed.

54:31.968 --> 54:35.199
Welcome back. Jimmy Lee
was on a roll tonight.

54:35.272 --> 54:39.732
Ten salvations. Big
bucks. You catch a coon?

54:39.809 --> 54:42.903
I was shot at. Somebody's
sure trying to scare me off.

54:42.979 --> 54:45.209
And they don't mind killing me
to underline the threat.

54:45.282 --> 54:50.481
You were shot at? Yep.
Now, who would do that?

54:50.553 --> 54:53.579
Damn shame. I'll go outside
and see what's goin' on.

55:02.832 --> 55:05.392
What was it? I thought I saw somethin'.

55:05.468 --> 55:10.371
I just fired in the air
to scare whatever it was.

55:19.816 --> 55:23.775
Didn't sleep well that night, and
it wasn't the fault of the water bed.

55:23.853 --> 55:27.186
Something was rotten
in this whole situation.

55:27.257 --> 55:29.248
Figuring out that the thug
who dropped my watch...

55:29.326 --> 55:33.262
was the same guy who stole it at the
morgue didn't take Sherlock Holmes.

55:33.330 --> 55:36.561
Larry Holmes
could've figured that out.

55:48.878 --> 55:53.542
I wasn't sure who'd be taking the next
shot at me, so I decided to work alone.

55:55.018 --> 55:57.179
Fletch, perfect timing. I've
got just what you asked for.

55:57.253 --> 56:01.349
Frank, stop salivating. I'm sending
you my Laker high-tops for lab analysis.

56:01.424 --> 56:05.121
He's behaving very strangely.
He must be in trouble.

56:05.195 --> 56:07.925
Somebody must be holding
a gun to his head.

56:07.997 --> 56:12.400
Fletch, if you need rescuing,
just say,

56:12.469 --> 56:15.927
"I believe Louisiana
is the Pelican State."

56:16.005 --> 56:20.499
Okay, Frank. I believe Louisiana is the
Pelican State... as a matter of fact.

56:20.577 --> 56:24.343
- What do you have on Farnsworth?
- I've got everything you need.

56:24.414 --> 56:27.611
Jimmy Lee Farnsworth, former
used-car salesman in Biloxi.

56:27.684 --> 56:32.348
In '77, he pleaded "no contest"
to a charge of check kiting.

56:32.422 --> 56:37.485
'81, discovered by businessmen who helped
him found the Farnsworth Television Ministry.

56:37.560 --> 56:40.825
Our sources indicate he may be a
target of federal investigation.

56:40.897 --> 56:43.832
- Anything else?
- Uh, two marriages.

56:43.900 --> 56:47.631
One daughter goes by wife's
maiden name. Becky Culpepper.

56:50.173 --> 56:53.870
It was hard to believe that beautiful
Becky was Farnsworth's daughter.

56:53.943 --> 56:55.877
But I wasn't gonna hold it
against her.

56:55.945 --> 56:59.642
If I was gonna hold anything against
her, it certainly wouldn't be her father.

57:18.568 --> 57:20.934
Fletch, I heard about the
fire. I hope you're all right.

57:21.004 --> 57:22.938
I'm just fine.

57:23.006 --> 57:27.500
I was just lying in the embers of my house,
trying to calm my nerves after being shot at.

57:27.577 --> 57:30.603
What? You were shot at? I was thinking
what a good day to sell my property...

57:30.680 --> 57:33.376
and move back to Los Angeles.

57:33.450 --> 57:35.384
Is the buyer
still interested?

57:36.453 --> 57:38.512
No, I'm afraid
he withdrew.

57:38.588 --> 57:41.113
I still have five minutes on the
meter. Let's talk in your office.

57:41.191 --> 57:46.652
Now, why don't you tell me
who your client is?

57:46.729 --> 57:49.289
Is it the
Farnsworth Ministry?

57:49.365 --> 57:52.630
Why would you say that?
And who is shooting at you?

57:52.702 --> 57:54.727
Maybe the
Reverend Farnsworth.

57:54.804 --> 57:58.467
Look, Jimmy Lee Farnsworth
may be a lot of things,

57:58.541 --> 58:00.566
but he's not a murderer.

58:00.643 --> 58:02.543
You're right,
he is many things.

58:02.612 --> 58:07.948
A former used-car salesman, a confessed
embezzler, your father, good square dancer.

58:10.653 --> 58:13.781
That's right,
he is my father.

58:13.857 --> 58:15.791
But I'm also
telling you the truth.

58:15.859 --> 58:20.762
Becky, somebody wants my land
bad enough to kill me for it.

58:20.830 --> 58:25.164
Now, if you don't tell me who your client
is, I'm gonna find out some other way.

58:25.635 --> 58:28.798
It is guest healer's night
with Jimmy Lee on this...

58:28.872 --> 58:33.502
the 4,323rd edition of our show
with tonight's special guests...

58:33.576 --> 58:35.942
people with
the healing gift.

58:36.012 --> 58:40.574
Excuse me. May I have your
name? I'm Claude Henry...

58:40.650 --> 58:44.086
Claude Henry...
Claude Henry.

58:44.153 --> 58:46.121
Claude... Claude or Clod is good. Henry.

58:46.189 --> 58:48.123
Henry.
Smmoot.

58:48.191 --> 58:52.753
Henry. Smmoot. S-M-M-O-T-T.
I'm sorry. Two "O's," one "T."

58:52.829 --> 58:55.730
I'm a guest healer.
Smmoot, a guest healer.

58:55.798 --> 58:57.425
Yes. Healed.
God bless you.

58:57.500 --> 58:59.434
With Mimsy Carlyle.

58:59.502 --> 59:03.336
Wait here.
The heavenly feet...

59:03.406 --> 59:05.874
of Damon Feather.

59:05.942 --> 59:09.673
God's simian favorite,
Mr. Coco.

59:09.746 --> 59:14.979
The guest healers who have volunteered
for tonight's show will follow Jimmy Lee.

59:19.889 --> 59:22.790
And now the founder
of our show,

59:22.859 --> 59:26.386
your friend,
Mr. Good News himself,

59:26.462 --> 59:29.329
Jimmy Lee Farnsworth.!

59:47.250 --> 59:49.377
You know,

59:49.452 --> 59:54.480
I have a feeling that there's someone out
there amongst us who needs to step forward.

59:54.557 --> 59:58.118
Gordon Joe James.

59:58.194 --> 01:00:02.494
Gordon Joe James.
Who are you?

01:00:02.565 --> 01:00:06.228
Gordon Joe lost a limb
to a pit bull.

01:00:06.302 --> 01:00:09.203
Gordon Joe, will you please
stand and raise your right hand?

01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:12.400
Left hand.
Excuse me, left hand.

01:00:12.475 --> 01:00:15.444
There you are.!

01:00:22.251 --> 01:00:25.516
Bibleland Two.
Jimmy Lee's dream.

01:00:25.588 --> 01:00:28.921
He was like some deranged
Walt Disney.

01:00:28.992 --> 01:00:31.688
It was all in front of me.
Ham Johnson's place.

01:00:31.761 --> 01:00:33.854
His mother's bequest.

01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:35.795
Belle Isle.

01:00:35.865 --> 01:00:40.461
The numbers on the boxes were certainly
not zip codes. Maybe computer codes.

01:00:40.536 --> 01:00:45.269
All I needed now was a computer, and a
ten-year-old kid to teach me how to use it.

01:00:45.341 --> 01:00:48.777
% Cash or check%

01:00:48.845 --> 01:00:50.904
% Or MasterCard%

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:54.609
% MasterCard% %

01:00:54.684 --> 01:00:56.709
Bobby Ralph?

01:00:56.786 --> 01:00:59.687
Peter Lemongello.
Your house is on fire.

01:00:59.756 --> 01:01:02.987
What? They told me to tell
you, your house is on fire.

01:01:03.059 --> 01:01:05.186
I'll take over.
God bless you!

01:01:05.261 --> 01:01:08.492
God bless you
for believing this shit.

01:01:18.041 --> 01:01:21.602
There was a new element I hadn't
anticipated:: A second suspect.

01:01:21.678 --> 01:01:26.081
Becky's client was not the ministry, but
some secret entity called Everest Development.

01:01:26.149 --> 01:01:27.980
She never knew who they were.

01:01:28.051 --> 01:01:31.851
Becky was a good girl, and wouldn't
have to be spanked. Damn it.

01:01:32.922 --> 01:01:35.948
Who's gonna be the next one
to get the call?

01:01:36.025 --> 01:01:38.493
Who's gonna be
the next one saved?

01:01:41.731 --> 01:01:44.359
- Who's going to be...
- T'Boo Ted Marshall.

01:01:44.434 --> 01:01:49.497
T'Boo Ted Marshall,
are you with us tonight?

01:01:49.572 --> 01:01:53.372
Yes, indeed, Reverend.!
But how can God help my problem?

01:01:53.443 --> 01:01:57.880
T'Boo Ted is a...
Compulsive gambler.

01:01:57.947 --> 01:02:03.283
T'Boo Ted, the first you
gotta do is expose that problem!

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:06.454
Excuse me?

01:02:06.522 --> 01:02:10.219
If you can't expose that
problem, at least to your family,

01:02:10.293 --> 01:02:15.230
it grows and grows, and becomes
an even bigger problem.!

01:02:15.298 --> 01:02:16.890
That's true!

01:02:16.966 --> 01:02:20.026
He's been a compulsive gambler
for 20 years.

01:02:20.103 --> 01:02:23.834
Because you've had this
affliction for more than 20 years,

01:02:23.906 --> 01:02:28.343
I think you should
expose that problem to us...

01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:30.971
right here... tonight.

01:02:31.047 --> 01:02:34.983
I want you to do it. The
good Lord wants you to do it!

01:02:35.051 --> 01:02:38.543
- You really think so?
- I know so!

01:02:39.822 --> 01:02:41.813
Do it. Do it now!

01:02:46.896 --> 01:02:49.831
Well, if you say so.

01:02:52.935 --> 01:02:55.495
Oh, God,
put your pants back on.!

01:02:55.571 --> 01:02:59.098
Coming right back to introduce
our guest healers.

01:02:59.175 --> 01:03:02.872
Let's welcome all of them
beginning with Claude Henry Smmoot.

01:03:04.413 --> 01:03:06.506
Come on out, Claude!

01:03:06.582 --> 01:03:08.516
Here we are.
I have a headache.

01:03:08.584 --> 01:03:10.575
No, Claude, this way.

01:03:13.856 --> 01:03:17.348
You're gonna do just fine.
Now, get out there. Go on.

01:03:19.929 --> 01:03:23.092
I said, get out there now!

01:03:23.166 --> 01:03:26.795
Here he is!
Make him welcome, folks!

01:03:26.869 --> 01:03:29.360
Welcome, Claude Henry.

01:03:29.438 --> 01:03:31.599
When was the very first time,

01:03:31.674 --> 01:03:36.441
the very first moment that made
the difference in your life?

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:40.606
Well, Jimmy Lee, I was...
I was, uh,

01:03:40.683 --> 01:03:45.017
on my gazebo, on the roof
making some repairs,

01:03:45.087 --> 01:03:48.545
and I was struck
by lightning.

01:03:48.624 --> 01:03:52.754
I have had acute migraine headaches
and blurred vision since then.

01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:55.423
But praise the Lord, that
was my lucky day because...

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:58.433
ever since then I have had
the healing power.

01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:01.664
Amen. God bless you. Thank you
very much. Good night. Thank you.

01:04:01.737 --> 01:04:04.797
Claude Henry. Good night.
What? What happened? Yes?

01:04:04.874 --> 01:04:07.308
Before you heal another,

01:04:07.376 --> 01:04:10.743
would you like for me to attempt
to heal your own affliction?

01:04:10.813 --> 01:04:14.681
No, no! No, no. No, those
of us with perfect faith...

01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:17.275
have no need
of perfect vision.

01:04:17.353 --> 01:04:19.617
We have no need of wisdom.

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:23.523
We have no need of anything except
the creature comforts and lots of them.

01:04:23.593 --> 01:04:27.825
Hallelujah.! Amen.! God bless
you. Amen. Thank you. Hallelujah.

01:04:27.897 --> 01:04:32.493
Ladies and gentlemen,
he sees more than he doth know.

01:04:32.568 --> 01:04:34.763
- Yes, I do.
Amen!

01:04:34.837 --> 01:04:38.273
Claude Henry has the gift.!

01:04:38.341 --> 01:04:42.778
Would you use that gift, Claude
Henry? Would you use it now?

01:04:46.749 --> 01:04:48.876
I guess I could.

01:04:48.951 --> 01:04:51.112
Praise be.

01:04:51.187 --> 01:04:55.681
Reverend, I sense that
in our audience...

01:04:55.758 --> 01:04:59.660
there is a gentleman
by the name of Jim Bob.

01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:02.823
Jim Bob, would you stand up?
Would you rise, please?

01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:07.692
Sixteen, 17...

01:05:07.770 --> 01:05:12.230
I sense that Jim Bob
is a young man.

01:05:12.308 --> 01:05:17.541
That he is between
the ages of 25, 27.

01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:22.578
That's more like it.

01:05:22.652 --> 01:05:26.179
I feel the Lord is telling me that
Jim Bob suffers from the same...

01:05:26.255 --> 01:05:31.852
Satanized affliction that I
suffer from: : Migraine headaches.

01:05:31.928 --> 01:05:34.158
Don't you, Jim Bob?
Is that you?

01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:36.528
Come on down, Jim Bob.!

01:05:36.599 --> 01:05:39.898
Praise be.! Hallelujah.!
Amen.!

01:05:39.969 --> 01:05:42.403
Praise the Lord!
Be saved!

01:05:42.471 --> 01:05:44.939
Jim Bob, welcome.
God bless you.

01:05:45.007 --> 01:05:48.670
Jim Bob, how long have
you had these headaches?

01:05:48.744 --> 01:05:53.113
About five, 10 minutes.
God... help him!

01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:57.878
- And how do you feel now?
- It's a throbbing...

01:05:57.954 --> 01:06:01.253
God bless you. A throbbing headache
comes up through your heels,

01:06:01.324 --> 01:06:04.725
up through the hip bone, the knee bone,
up the spine, up through your back,

01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:07.024
through your head like Satan
was belching through you?

01:06:07.096 --> 01:06:09.428
- Is that it?
- Exactly.

01:06:09.498 --> 01:06:11.363
- Do you believe?
- I believe.

01:06:11.434 --> 01:06:16.872
He believes! Hallelujah!
Amen! God bless. Amen.

01:06:16.939 --> 01:06:20.067
Hallelujah.

01:06:22.311 --> 01:06:27.146
Rid this man of these headache
demons, of these migraine demons.

01:06:27.216 --> 01:06:29.776
Heal this man!

01:06:29.852 --> 01:06:31.786
Amen!

01:06:31.854 --> 01:06:33.981
Amen!

01:06:34.056 --> 01:06:37.457
Hallelujah!
Oh, good golly, Miss Molly!

01:06:37.526 --> 01:06:40.120
How do you feel, son?
My headache is gone, but...

01:06:40.196 --> 01:06:42.664
God bless him! Is there
anything else I can do for you?

01:06:42.732 --> 01:06:46.896
No! No. Good! God bless you. Praise be.

01:06:46.969 --> 01:06:51.633
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you so much. Ouch!

01:06:53.342 --> 01:06:55.537
I am worn to the bone.

01:06:55.611 --> 01:06:58.273
Thank you very much for
gracing us with your presence.

01:06:58.347 --> 01:07:00.611
Good night. Praise be!

01:07:04.787 --> 01:07:07.347
Maybe I was wrong
about Farnsworth.

01:07:07.423 --> 01:07:10.392
There was a new player in the
game: : Becky's unknown client.

01:07:10.459 --> 01:07:13.451
I had to find out more, and the
only way was to get into her pants...

01:07:13.529 --> 01:07:18.466
I mean, her car. At least it
had brakes. Her car, that is.

01:07:18.534 --> 01:07:21.503
Fletch, what
are you doing?

01:07:21.570 --> 01:07:24.130
The guy who works in there
stole my watch.

01:07:24.206 --> 01:07:28.267
He dropped it while he was trying to kill
me. I'd just as soon he not recognize me.

01:07:28.344 --> 01:07:32.542
I'd like to keep an eye on him.
Maybe he'll lead us to his boss.

01:07:32.615 --> 01:07:34.947
How long are we
gonna be here?

01:07:35.017 --> 01:07:36.951
Bored?

01:07:37.019 --> 01:07:39.544
Oh, no!
This is exciting!

01:07:50.199 --> 01:07:52.133
Fletch?
What?

01:07:52.201 --> 01:07:54.795
I have to pee.

01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:57.498
The same thing used to happen
whenever I'd play hide-and-seek.

01:07:57.573 --> 01:08:01.134
I always got caught. You think
the morgue has a ladies' room?

01:08:01.210 --> 01:08:03.474
Hey.

01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:17.685
Not so close. Try to get a
little distance between you.

01:08:53.529 --> 01:08:57.932
I'm gonna have to play it pretty
tough in there. Still have to pee?

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.765
I gather the rain
isn't helping a lot.

01:09:01.837 --> 01:09:04.772
- There's always the bushes.
- I'll be okay.

01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:10.536
If I'm not back in five minutes,
call your dad.

01:09:36.205 --> 01:09:39.002
Could I have a soda, please?

01:09:39.073 --> 01:09:41.439
Diet Pepsi or a Tab
would be good.

01:09:48.751 --> 01:09:53.620
- Hey, pussy.
- Name's Ed. Ed Harley.

01:09:54.924 --> 01:09:57.484
Are you sure
you're in the right place?

01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:59.994
I think so.

01:10:00.062 --> 01:10:02.121
"Think so"!

01:10:04.333 --> 01:10:07.632
Ed, what are you doin' here?

01:10:07.703 --> 01:10:10.297
I'll give you a hint.

01:10:10.372 --> 01:10:13.830
Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
Hmm?

01:10:16.178 --> 01:10:18.976
You don't get it?

01:10:19.048 --> 01:10:22.040
You're the one
that doesn't get it.

01:10:22.117 --> 01:10:26.019
Ed Harley.
Harley-Davidson Motorcycles.

01:10:28.324 --> 01:10:30.383
You own the company?

01:10:30.459 --> 01:10:35.158
Well, my granddaddy started it. Then my
daddy screwed Davidson out of his half.

01:10:35.231 --> 01:10:37.961
Now I own the whole thing.

01:10:38.033 --> 01:10:41.002
- Harley-Davidson?
No shit? - No shit.

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:44.198
Hey, y'all, Ed Harley
of Harley-Davidson!

01:10:44.273 --> 01:10:46.298
We're the Nazis from Natchez!

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:13.866
Who're you callin',
babe?

01:11:19.241 --> 01:11:22.677
Knock it off! Yo, boss, look who's here!

01:11:22.745 --> 01:11:26.374
Harley-Davidson. Yo, Ed, come
over here and meet the boss.

01:11:26.448 --> 01:11:31.078
Hi. Ed Harley, the Third.
Harley-Davidson Motorcycles.

01:11:31.153 --> 01:11:36.523
If you need any T-shirts or decals,
I can make arrangements for you.

01:11:36.592 --> 01:11:38.457
I just can't wait.

01:11:38.527 --> 01:11:41.894
- What model do you ride?
- '78 XL.

01:11:41.964 --> 01:11:46.924
'78 XL? That's a legend!
It's not blue, is it?

01:11:47.002 --> 01:11:50.267
- You in luck, white boy. Come on.
- Oh!

01:11:52.207 --> 01:11:57.338
There she is. Ain't she
beautiful? Original blue!

01:11:57.413 --> 01:12:01.782
Oh, she is a beaut. Gee, golly,
I'd love to ride this '78 XL.

01:12:01.850 --> 01:12:04.648
Nobody...

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:06.813
touches my Hog.

01:12:06.889 --> 01:12:10.950
- Sorry. - If you wanna ride
that low-rider, that's all right.

01:12:11.026 --> 01:12:14.018
Hell, we'll all ride.
Fire 'em up!

01:12:14.096 --> 01:12:16.223
Do you mind if...
Darleen.

01:12:16.298 --> 01:12:19.756
- If Darleen rides with me?
- Feeling a little horny, Ed?

01:12:19.835 --> 01:12:24.898
Yeah. You know, my life
isn't all hubs and gears.

01:12:29.345 --> 01:12:31.779
Take it easy.

01:12:40.823 --> 01:12:43.018
% All right now%

01:12:45.761 --> 01:12:49.629
% Hey, hey
We're gonna go out tonight%

01:12:49.698 --> 01:12:52.690
Little murky in the oxydol.

01:12:52.768 --> 01:12:55.168
We're gonna flush that out,
suck it, streamline it.

01:12:55.237 --> 01:12:59.264
Hey, your mustache
looks funny.

01:12:59.341 --> 01:13:02.538
Oh, boy.

01:13:02.611 --> 01:13:04.670
Hey, look at that!
Came off.

01:13:06.749 --> 01:13:09.240
% One for the money
Two for the show%

01:13:09.318 --> 01:13:12.549
% Gotta go, let's go
Hey, hey%

01:13:12.621 --> 01:13:15.522
% Gonna go out tonight%

01:13:15.591 --> 01:13:17.718
% Gonna have some fun%

01:13:17.793 --> 01:13:20.557
% Everything
will be all right% %

01:13:32.541 --> 01:13:37.843
What're we gonna do? Something that
will seem extremely stupid at first.

01:14:00.436 --> 01:14:02.700
Oh, my God!

01:14:08.577 --> 01:14:13.344
Yee-ha!

01:14:19.488 --> 01:14:21.422
Home!

01:14:21.490 --> 01:14:24.459
Oh, my God!
I'm a mess.

01:14:24.526 --> 01:14:27.723
You want some coffee?
Sure.

01:14:27.796 --> 01:14:30.128
I look like a raccoon.

01:14:30.199 --> 01:14:34.795
I gotta get to work, although I don't know
why. All I do is sit with nothing to do.

01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:38.966
The only work I've had in the last three
months has been with Everest Realty.

01:14:39.041 --> 01:14:40.975
And look what that's gotten
me. Can I use your phone?

01:14:41.043 --> 01:14:43.944
Sure, go ahead.

01:14:44.012 --> 01:14:47.470
That's toxic waste on the soles.
What have you been doing?

01:14:47.549 --> 01:14:49.881
Jogging in the Love Canal.
What do you mean "toxic waste"?

01:14:49.952 --> 01:14:54.912
- It's special. There's only 11 places that make this shit.
- Where?

01:14:59.461 --> 01:15:02.396
Frank, just give me the ones
that aren't in New Jersey.

01:15:02.464 --> 01:15:05.331
Ah, there's only one.
Yazoo, Mississippi.

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:07.834
Bingo.

01:15:13.742 --> 01:15:16.768
I wanna thank you
for everything you've done.

01:15:16.845 --> 01:15:20.212
I'm sorry I caused
such a mess.

01:15:20.282 --> 01:15:24.241
Can I ask you a personal
question? Mm-hmm.

01:15:24.319 --> 01:15:28.016
Did you finally get
to pee?

01:15:28.090 --> 01:15:31.082
Yes.

01:15:31.159 --> 01:15:33.320
Good.

01:15:40.369 --> 01:15:43.463
You better get cleaned up.

01:15:45.007 --> 01:15:47.999
Yeah.
Particularly my mind.

01:15:57.352 --> 01:16:00.185
Where's the shampoo?
I'll get you some.

01:16:05.894 --> 01:16:08.089
Here. You'll need
a clean towel too.

01:16:08.163 --> 01:16:10.961
No, yours will be fine.
Fletch!

01:16:13.302 --> 01:16:16.999
You're right.
This is too wet.

01:16:17.072 --> 01:16:20.405
You know how
to get to Yazoo?

01:16:20.475 --> 01:16:23.205
Well, you're in
the right vicinity.

01:16:23.278 --> 01:16:27.146
The church seemed less
and less culpable.

01:16:27.215 --> 01:16:31.982
Why would they want toxic waste next
to their land? Why would anybody?

01:16:32.054 --> 01:16:36.684
Why are there four S's in Mississippi?
Four I's and only two P's...

01:16:36.758 --> 01:16:39.693
and one "M'"
as far as I know?

01:16:44.633 --> 01:16:49.832
Bly Bio Chem was the biggest
chemical plant in Mississippi.

01:16:49.905 --> 01:16:52.738
My Laker shoes were ruined
by toxic waste produced there.

01:16:52.808 --> 01:16:55.709
They probably knew who
delivered it to my backyard.

01:16:55.777 --> 01:16:59.304
Now the lead-lined containers
painted with innocent bluebirds...

01:16:59.381 --> 01:17:01.713
added a crucial piece
to the puzzle...

01:17:01.783 --> 01:17:04.115
that had begun way back
in Amanda Ross's pants...

01:17:04.186 --> 01:17:07.246
I mean, bedroom.

01:17:07.322 --> 01:17:09.381
This is a secure area.

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:14.122
I'm very happy for you. Most people
live in terrible neighborhoods.

01:17:14.196 --> 01:17:18.223
Are you the head honcho? That's
right, sir. Headly Dan Duke.

01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:20.291
And what seems
to be your problem?

01:17:20.369 --> 01:17:24.271
I agreed to take a shit load of
that Bluebird crap off your hands.

01:17:24.339 --> 01:17:28.469
And it ain't come yet. I'm
very sorry, sir. And you are?

01:17:28.543 --> 01:17:30.272
I are pissed!

01:17:30.345 --> 01:17:33.542
Some damn fool told me it was on
back order, and I'd have to wait.

01:17:33.615 --> 01:17:35.583
Whose signature is this?
Who signed that? I can't...

01:17:35.651 --> 01:17:39.212
That's the trouble! It's
typical of a large corporation.

01:17:39.287 --> 01:17:42.620
Lack of communication. That's
why I like to keep Everest small.

01:17:42.691 --> 01:17:46.024
Oh, you're from Everest!
Now you're talkin'!

01:17:46.094 --> 01:17:50.394
Elmer Gantry. Elmer Fudd Gantry. I'm
not sure there's anything I can do.

01:17:50.465 --> 01:17:54.128
You could pull my file instead of
standing there pulling your pud!

01:17:54.202 --> 01:17:57.228
Whatever you say, sir.

01:17:57.305 --> 01:17:59.773
Bring me the Everest file.

01:17:59.841 --> 01:18:02.309
Yes, sir.

01:18:04.579 --> 01:18:07.047
Mr. Gantry?

01:18:08.717 --> 01:18:13.120
I apologize for my bellicosity.
I've had a hernia operation.

01:18:13.188 --> 01:18:15.418
Is that the stuff
I'm supposed to get?

01:18:15.490 --> 01:18:18.982
Yes, sir. Why are they
wearing those funny suits?

01:18:19.061 --> 01:18:23.020
They're protective, as you know. That's a
very corrosive by-product they're handling.

01:18:23.098 --> 01:18:25.123
Oh, yeah. I guess if they
didn't wear those suits,

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:30.763
those boys would be so full of holes,
they'd whistle when they walked.

01:18:30.839 --> 01:18:34.605
I've been spitting up blood,
pissing blood, bleeding.

01:18:34.676 --> 01:18:38.009
I go through five
of these suits a day.

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:41.140
It appears you have
your facts wrong, Mr. Gantry.

01:18:41.216 --> 01:18:43.650
Your company is supposed
to get 1500 gallons.

01:18:43.719 --> 01:18:46.950
Destination someplace
called Belle Isle in Louisiana.

01:18:47.022 --> 01:18:50.480
Signed for by an officer of
your company and due the 23rd.

01:18:50.559 --> 01:18:54.290
So... we're right,
and you're wrong.

01:18:54.362 --> 01:18:57.331
Let me see that.

01:18:57.399 --> 01:19:01.392
Takes a big man to admit when
he's wrong. I am not a big man.

01:19:08.744 --> 01:19:11.736
We're late again, because you
had to stay late at the jail.

01:19:11.813 --> 01:19:13.747
Hurry up.
Just get out.

01:19:21.490 --> 01:19:24.425
Are you all right?

01:19:24.493 --> 01:19:29.760
You're wrecking my present.
My fault?

01:19:29.831 --> 01:19:32.561
Wash and gas it.
Check the brake fluid, will ya?

01:19:35.537 --> 01:19:37.937
My friends,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:19:38.006 --> 01:19:43.273
With all the fun we've been having, I hope we
don't forget our real purpose here tonight...

01:19:43.345 --> 01:19:47.338
to preserve the legacy
that nature has given us.

01:19:47.415 --> 01:19:50.179
We are mere custodians of...

01:19:50.252 --> 01:19:53.278
Bob Lee.
Bobby Lee. Bobby Lee.

01:19:53.355 --> 01:19:57.553
Bobby Lee.
Bobby Lee Schwartz.

01:19:57.626 --> 01:20:01.619
Schwartz.
Schwartz, the Second.

01:20:25.287 --> 01:20:28.950
Fletch!
What you doin' here?

01:20:29.024 --> 01:20:34.360
- What are you doin' here?
- You know me. I ain't happy unless I'm working.

01:20:34.429 --> 01:20:39.389
Why, Fletch, I'm surprised to see
you here, sir. Welcome, sir, welcome.

01:20:39.467 --> 01:20:42.402
My pleasure, my pleasure.
Thank you for not inviting me.

01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:44.665
Oh!

01:20:46.908 --> 01:20:49.274
I do believe we have
something to discuss.

01:20:49.344 --> 01:20:54.509
Oh. Well, might I suggest we
repair ourselves to a quieter place.

01:20:54.583 --> 01:20:56.949
Let us remove ourselves,
shall we?

01:20:57.018 --> 01:21:00.749
Son of a gun, we'll have
big fun on the bayou.

01:21:06.328 --> 01:21:08.728
My mama's room.

01:21:10.065 --> 01:21:13.865
I've kept it just the
way it was when she died.

01:21:15.337 --> 01:21:17.931
Her ashes?

01:21:18.006 --> 01:21:21.703
She used to say, "We come from the
earth and we return to the earth,

01:21:21.776 --> 01:21:24.267
and in between,
we garden."

01:21:24.346 --> 01:21:27.509
A little gardening,

01:21:27.582 --> 01:21:30.346
a little polluting.

01:21:35.090 --> 01:21:37.320
They spelled my name wrong.

01:21:39.394 --> 01:21:41.521
My gun's made of rubber.
How 'bout yours?

01:21:42.898 --> 01:21:46.834
No.
I see your point.

01:21:46.902 --> 01:21:49.302
Wouldn't do for your conservationists
guests to hear about...

01:21:49.371 --> 01:21:52.033
that load of toxic waste heading
for my land at Belle Isle.

01:21:52.107 --> 01:21:56.237
My land...
at Belle Isle, Fletch.

01:21:56.311 --> 01:22:00.509
After you die, who's gonna prove that
you did not sell your land to Everest?

01:22:00.582 --> 01:22:03.278
You may have this town
in your back pocket, Johnson,

01:22:03.351 --> 01:22:06.320
but there are a lot of people downstairs
who are gonna be very interested...

01:22:06.388 --> 01:22:09.846
in the hows and whys
of Amanda Ray's death.

01:22:09.925 --> 01:22:11.950
She knew about Bluebird.

01:22:12.027 --> 01:22:14.860
She started a file on you,
and you found out about it.

01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:20.197
That was my lucky night. The night I found
the Bluebird file, the night you porked her.

01:22:20.268 --> 01:22:24.728
I figured it was like an alligator shoot on
the freeway, if you'll excuse the metaphor.

01:22:24.806 --> 01:22:28.537
- It's not a metaphor. It's a simile, to be precise.
- Whatever.

01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:34.412
So you poisoned Amanda, figuring I'd sell
and get out if I was facing a murder charge.

01:22:34.482 --> 01:22:38.111
- I don't scare easy. I'm too dumb.
- So it would seem.

01:22:38.186 --> 01:22:42.247
Now get out of my mama's chair before
I put the first bullet up your nose.

01:22:42.324 --> 01:22:44.656
Are you kidding?

01:22:44.726 --> 01:22:47.456
You pull that trigger and 100
people will be up here in a second.

01:22:47.529 --> 01:22:50.464
My dear boy, why would
I do my own dirty work?

01:22:51.967 --> 01:22:55.232
Those hundred do-gooders down
there dressed in rebel crap...

01:22:55.303 --> 01:22:57.737
will be my alibi.

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:01.873
Now get outta
my mama's chair!

01:23:01.943 --> 01:23:05.538
I synchronized my beloved Laker
watch with Miss Culpepper's Timex.

01:23:05.613 --> 01:23:08.878
If I don’t join her at the ministry
in 10 minutes, the whole ugly story...

01:23:08.950 --> 01:23:11.748
goes out on
the Farnsworth Network.

01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:13.913
Of course, it's cable, but...

01:23:13.989 --> 01:23:16.389
- You're bluffing, Fletch.
- No, I'm not.

01:23:16.458 --> 01:23:19.359
You think you're not...
but you are.

01:23:21.029 --> 01:23:23.463
Swell.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.869
- Did he hurt you?
- Not yet. That comes later.

01:23:29.938 --> 01:23:31.906
Sorry, Becky.

01:23:31.973 --> 01:23:36.967
The band won't take a break for some
time, so screaming would be futile.

01:23:37.045 --> 01:23:40.014
Mr. Fletch's convenient
appearance has allowed us...

01:23:40.081 --> 01:23:45.451
to move up our plans for your
demise to coincide with his.

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:50.321
Now I'm goin' downstairs
to be the gracious host.

01:23:50.392 --> 01:23:54.158
Do what you have to do.

01:23:54.229 --> 01:23:57.357
- The bride of Frankenstein.
- Put my mama down!

01:23:57.432 --> 01:23:59.423
Oh! I'm sorry.

01:23:59.501 --> 01:24:01.935
Oh, how clumsy of me.

01:24:02.003 --> 01:24:05.769
Oops! I'm sorry. I stepped
right on her mustache.

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:09.139
Get away! Get away!

01:24:09.210 --> 01:24:12.111
- Sorry. I was just trying to help.
- It's all right, Mama.

01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:14.444
You should be more careful
where you put your breakables.

01:24:14.516 --> 01:24:16.984
I've been careful
all my life.

01:24:17.052 --> 01:24:19.213
When she was sick,
I was careful.

01:24:19.287 --> 01:24:23.621
Then that goddamn Jimmy Lee's
ministry... taking everything she had.

01:24:23.691 --> 01:24:26.785
Bloodsuckers!

01:24:26.861 --> 01:24:30.627
It's gonna be all right, Mama.
And when we're far, far away...

01:24:30.698 --> 01:24:32.757
from this godforsaken
chemical swamp,

01:24:32.834 --> 01:24:37.635
we're gonna sit back and
watch 'em all just decompose.

01:24:37.705 --> 01:24:41.698
That should be good for Bibleland's business,
all their customers glowing in the dark.

01:24:41.776 --> 01:24:44.745
I hope they all fry
in hell!

01:24:44.813 --> 01:24:48.146
- You bloodsucking bastards!
- Isn't this interesting?

01:24:48.216 --> 01:24:50.184
- Put that down.
- She really is in there.

01:24:50.251 --> 01:24:52.913
- Put that down.
- She seems to have lost a little weight.

01:24:52.987 --> 01:24:56.184
I thought you had her stuffed and
mounted. Here she is. Head's up!

01:24:56.257 --> 01:24:58.088
Ohh! Ohh!
Becky!

01:25:09.437 --> 01:25:13.874
Swine... Darryl, are
you having a good time?

01:25:58.019 --> 01:26:01.420
Welcome to great Noah's Ark...

01:26:01.489 --> 01:26:05.289
where we have a flood
every 10 minutes.

01:26:07.228 --> 01:26:09.128
In the...

01:26:17.005 --> 01:26:18.632
No! This way.

01:26:18.706 --> 01:26:20.765
Join our pyramid of prayer.

01:26:20.842 --> 01:26:23.333
For only $12,

01:26:23.411 --> 01:26:27.347
you begin your exciting journey
up the pyramid.

01:26:27.415 --> 01:26:29.349
And when you reach the top,

01:26:29.417 --> 01:26:35.481
you're gonna be the target
of 20,000 prayers!

01:26:35.557 --> 01:26:40.358
A lady in Fargo, North Dakota broke the
chain and began a five-day fit of sneezing...

01:26:40.428 --> 01:26:42.623
that ended in her death.
Daddy?

01:26:42.697 --> 01:26:48.363
Well, Mr. Fletcher, what a pleasant
surprise. And, Becky, what are you...

01:26:48.436 --> 01:26:52.668
Look who's here! Hamilton
Johnson! Friend of the community.

01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:56.176
Ham, you look like you've
worked up quite a sweat.

01:26:56.244 --> 01:26:58.712
Maybe you should dry your hair
first. Do you want a towel?

01:26:58.780 --> 01:27:02.113
Uh-oh, he's got a gun.

01:27:02.183 --> 01:27:07.211
Show your lovely face on national television.
Let 'em see that greedy glint in your eye.

01:27:07.288 --> 01:27:09.222
Let 'em hear
that bullshit chuckle, Ham.

01:27:09.290 --> 01:27:11.315
Who's gonna save you now,
Fletch?

01:27:11.392 --> 01:27:14.384
You'll have to shoot through
me, you son of a bitch!

01:27:14.462 --> 01:27:17.898
He's not gonna shoot anybody. Are
you, Ham? You're on television now.

01:27:17.966 --> 01:27:20.332
You haven't got the guts.

01:27:20.401 --> 01:27:23.131
- My mistake.
- Freeze!

01:27:23.204 --> 01:27:27.368
F.B.I. Drop the gun!
I said, drop it. Harry!

01:27:35.450 --> 01:27:40.547
And it's my plan to rerun this
incident every night during Sweeps Week.

01:27:40.622 --> 01:27:43.716
The obvious question is... What did
you know and when did you know it?

01:27:43.791 --> 01:27:46.055
And how long did you plan
on letting me twist in the wind?

01:27:46.127 --> 01:27:49.858
Up to a point. The Agency was
barking up the same tree you were.

01:27:49.931 --> 01:27:52.729
Jimmy Lee's finances.
Yep.

01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:56.497
It was easy for Harry and Field Officer
Vincent to infiltrate the ministry.

01:27:56.571 --> 01:27:58.766
Field Officer Vincent?

01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:01.331
That's Mr. Coco's
real name.

01:28:01.409 --> 01:28:04.242
We've been working on
this case for over a year.

01:28:04.312 --> 01:28:09.079
Excuse me, Agent Goldstein, the officer
would like to speak to you. Surely.

01:28:09.150 --> 01:28:11.118
Goldstein?

01:28:15.323 --> 01:28:17.985
Thank you, sir.

01:28:18.059 --> 01:28:20.892
Ding dong,
the wicked witch is dead.

01:28:20.962 --> 01:28:24.557
So what's next, Fletch?
Back to L.A.?

01:28:24.632 --> 01:28:26.759
There's no place like home.

01:28:26.834 --> 01:28:29.132
Unless home is here.

01:28:29.203 --> 01:28:33.105
You know what? We gotta get you
away from this chemical swamp.

01:28:33.174 --> 01:28:36.371
I was wondering...
Do you like smog?

01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:41.648
Back home there was
a surprise party for me.

01:28:41.716 --> 01:28:47.052
But the nicest surprise was an insurance
check for the Belle Isle fire... $ 100,000.

01:28:47.121 --> 01:28:51.785
However, no one stopped Bly Bio Chem
from dumping that toxic waste on my land.

01:28:51.859 --> 01:28:56.489
They told me not to worry. Its
half-life was estimated at 3,000 years.

01:28:56.564 --> 01:28:58.555
Everything okay, Fletch?

01:28:58.633 --> 01:29:01.397
Betty was a little pissed off
about giving up her office,

01:29:01.469 --> 01:29:04.267
and accounting gave me some flak
about the new car, but trust me,

01:29:04.339 --> 01:29:07.672
everything's gonna be just the
way you want it, maybe better.

01:29:07.742 --> 01:29:10.108
I like your attitude, Frank.

01:29:10.178 --> 01:29:13.636
Excuse me just a sec. What a guy!

01:29:15.783 --> 01:29:20.447
I thought I told you...
never to come to my workplace.

01:29:20.521 --> 01:29:22.716
Time's change, my dear Fletch.

01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:26.123
Rumor has it that you have inherited
a sizable piece of property.

01:29:26.194 --> 01:29:30.426
Who told you?
I have my sources too.

01:29:30.498 --> 01:29:34.093
These sources also suggest that you may
have been considering skipping town...

01:29:34.168 --> 01:29:36.363
and retiring
on this vast estate.

01:29:36.437 --> 01:29:39.372
Thus skipping out on your
financial responsibilities.

01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:43.934
Would I do that? Wendy could
probably get half of it anyway.

01:29:44.011 --> 01:29:48.778
So in return for the other half,
we would forego any other claims.

01:29:48.850 --> 01:29:52.809
Think about it.
You would never see me again.

01:29:57.859 --> 01:30:00.623
Where do I sign?

01:30:04.966 --> 01:30:07.230
I'll never see you again?
Never.

01:30:12.273 --> 01:30:15.538
You realize this is
my family land?

01:30:16.811 --> 01:30:19.575
Does it please you to
rip out my ancestral roots?

01:30:19.647 --> 01:30:22.878
I was born and raised
in a briar patch.

01:30:31.859 --> 01:30:34.589
Now Wendy can live
a life of leisure.

01:30:34.662 --> 01:30:39.395
Clean air, clean water. This is
the way she was destined to live.

01:30:39.467 --> 01:30:43.198
Okay, Gillet.
You've broken me.

01:30:43.271 --> 01:30:45.205
I hope you're happy.

01:30:53.381 --> 01:30:56.942
% Hey, hey
We gonna go out tonight%

01:30:58.252 --> 01:31:03.349
% Hey, hey

01:31:03.424 --> 01:31:07.383

Everything will be all right%

01:31:16.003 --> 01:31:17.937
