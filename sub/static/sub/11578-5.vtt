00:23.115 --> 00:24.929
In the criminal justice system,

00:24.929 --> 00:28.684
sexually-based offenses
are considered especially heinous

00:28.684 --> 00:29.895
In New York City,

00:29.895 --> 00:33.404
the dedicated detectives who investigate
these vicious felonies are members

00:33.404 --> 00:36.460
of an elite squad known
as The Special Victims Unit.

00:36.460 --> 00:38.722
These are their stories.

00:49.498 --> 00:50.899
Let go, it's mine.

00:50.899 --> 00:54.141
Okay, now it's mine.

00:59.861 --> 01:01.587
Hey, boys, here you go.

01:02.311 --> 01:03.459
Come on, man, let's go.

01:03.459 --> 01:05.522
- Play nice.
- Hey, Mama.

01:05.680 --> 01:06.929
Get away from here.

01:06.929 --> 01:08.927
- Right now.
- What, bitch?

01:08.927 --> 01:10.486
I think you need to chill.

01:10.486 --> 01:12.469
Charlie, can you send...

01:19.559 --> 01:20.779
Help!

01:21.272 --> 01:23.744
God, please, somebody help!

01:26.181 --> 01:28.176
Oh, Jesus!

01:28.176 --> 01:29.991
Come here. Help!

01:29.991 --> 01:32.369
Help! Somebody, please!

01:34.016 --> 01:35.721
Help me!

01:35.721 --> 01:37.446
Help!

01:43.371 --> 01:44.827
What?

01:44.970 --> 01:48.014
There was a shooting
at P.S. 387 in East Harlem

01:48.014 --> 01:50.629
six year old girl, died at the scene.

01:50.629 --> 01:52.985
They're bringing the shooter up now.

01:53.126 --> 01:55.002
Why did we catch it?

01:55.156 --> 01:57.569
Brass thinks we're better equipped
to handle him.

01:57.569 --> 01:59.566
Good. Bring on the pervert.

Law & Order SVU
2x05 Baby Killer

02:55.004 --> 02:57.864
ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC: 2000/11/17

03:03.255 --> 03:06.272
Does that look like
a cold-blooded killer to you?

03:08.512 --> 03:10.554
Where are we on the parents?

03:10.554 --> 03:13.669
Both of them called in sick today.
Nobody knows how to find them.

03:13.669 --> 03:16.130
Well, that fills in a few blanks for me.

03:16.130 --> 03:18.333
Can you even charge
a 7-year-old with murder?

03:18.333 --> 03:21.560
- Technically, he just made the cutoff.
- Det. Benson?

03:21.655 --> 03:22.460
Yes.

03:22.460 --> 03:25.101
You left a message. Our son, Elias,
was involved in a shooting?

03:25.101 --> 03:27.845
They gave this address,
not a hospital, is he...

03:27.845 --> 03:29.645
Oh, God! Please say he's alive.

03:29.645 --> 03:32.464
Mrs. Barrera, I'm sorry about
the misunderstanding.

03:32.464 --> 03:34.311
Elias wasn't the one who was shot.

03:34.311 --> 03:35.890
Oh, thank God.

03:35.890 --> 03:37.765
He was the shooter.

03:38.456 --> 03:39.578
What?

03:39.578 --> 03:41.728
- Sir, do you own a gun?
- No.

03:41.728 --> 03:43.283
Does your son have access to one?

03:43.283 --> 03:44.583
I don't know how.

03:44.583 --> 03:46.889
He's either at home, school,
or his sitter's.

03:46.889 --> 03:49.743
- And who's that?
- Mrs. Strada. Where's our son?

03:49.743 --> 03:52.276
We want to talk to him with you.

03:52.276 --> 03:54.349
But we can't do that
without your permission.

03:54.349 --> 03:56.037
If you would sign a Miranda waiver...

03:56.037 --> 03:58.597
Fine. That's fine.
Just let us see him.

03:58.597 --> 04:00.618
Okay, come with me please.

04:05.708 --> 04:07.725
You run them through License Division?

04:07.725 --> 04:09.469
He had no guns registered.

04:09.469 --> 04:11.775
Of course, the serial number was
filed off the gun he used.

04:11.775 --> 04:13.610
Punched them
in the system, clean sheets.

04:13.610 --> 04:15.163
No arrests, no warrant.

04:15.163 --> 04:17.185
We were at the emergency room
all morning.

04:17.185 --> 04:19.297
My baby girl was born
with a respiratory problem.

04:19.297 --> 04:21.271
We had to leave her at the hospital.

04:21.271 --> 04:23.467
Why don't you take a seat here.

04:23.635 --> 04:25.199
Elias?

04:36.042 --> 04:38.338
It's okay. All right.

04:38.338 --> 04:41.042
Elias, why don't we
have you sit right here.

04:42.320 --> 04:45.556
Hi, Elias, I'm Elliot.
How are you doing?

04:46.140 --> 04:48.512
We're going to talk today, is that okay?

04:49.116 --> 04:51.020
Do you like school?

04:51.237 --> 04:53.127
- What grade are you in?
- Second.

04:53.127 --> 04:54.843
Second. That's a good grade.

04:54.843 --> 04:56.390
I like second grade.

04:56.390 --> 04:58.598
What's your favorite subject?

05:00.682 --> 05:05.672
Okay. We're going to talk a little bit
about what happened today. Okay?

05:06.144 --> 05:08.634
Do you know Carly Jackson?

05:08.634 --> 05:09.993
Yeah?

05:09.993 --> 05:12.530
What can you tell me about Carly?

05:12.759 --> 05:14.990
She's a girl.

05:16.320 --> 05:18.016
Yeah.

05:19.010 --> 05:20.775
Yeah.

05:21.063 --> 05:23.078
You like Carly?

05:24.989 --> 05:27.264
No? How come?

05:27.569 --> 05:29.964
She's always bothering me.

05:29.964 --> 05:32.030
How does she bother you?

05:32.030 --> 05:34.847
She chases me.

05:35.136 --> 05:37.633
She tries to kiss me.

05:38.007 --> 05:39.198
Okay.

05:40.050 --> 05:44.745
Can you tell me what happened
to Carly at recess?

05:46.127 --> 05:48.620
She fell down.

05:50.180 --> 05:52.665
What made her fall down?

05:58.588 --> 06:00.439
The gun.

06:01.093 --> 06:04.164
The gun. Okay.

06:06.887 --> 06:09.678
Who's holding the gun?

06:10.869 --> 06:13.890
Is Carly going to be okay?

06:17.500 --> 06:21.327
Elias, tell me who had the gun.

06:25.009 --> 06:27.397
I did.

06:27.998 --> 06:30.712
You know what, I think we should
get a lawyer before we go on.

06:30.712 --> 06:33.426
Okay, sir. That's fine.
You get a lawyer.

06:33.426 --> 06:34.997
We got a phone out there.

06:34.997 --> 06:37.338
He has to stay with us, okay.

06:37.582 --> 06:38.633
Get Fin.

06:38.633 --> 06:41.219
Check out friends, family,
neighbors, school...

06:41.219 --> 06:43.653
anyone he could have got that gun from.

06:43.653 --> 06:48.128
As slipshod as the screening process is,
I doubt he bought it himself.

06:51.354 --> 06:54.067
Watch it. Watch your back.
Come on.

07:07.840 --> 07:09.873
Elias and Carly fight a lot?

07:09.873 --> 07:12.558
Neither had been sent to my office.

07:12.558 --> 07:14.416
Where were you when it happened?

07:14.416 --> 07:16.129
Over there.

07:16.129 --> 07:18.769
I ran to her, called for help,

07:18.769 --> 07:21.040
and then I saw Elias.

07:21.040 --> 07:22.862
Where exactly?

07:23.372 --> 07:26.885
Putting the gun in the garbage can.

07:29.139 --> 07:32.650
Elias said that Carly picked on him.

07:32.650 --> 07:35.866
Carly was the sweetest little girl.

07:37.756 --> 07:39.898
Did we miss something?

07:40.274 --> 07:44.086
He wasn't a troublemaker.
He didn't even talk in line.

07:45.295 --> 07:48.510
Home of Mrs.Dorothea Strada
1630 Lexington Avenue
Tuesday, November 7

07:48.510 --> 07:50.527
He's always been an angel.

07:50.527 --> 07:52.710
What made Elias do this?

07:52.860 --> 07:54.744
That's what we're trying to find out.

07:54.744 --> 07:58.141
Mrs. Strada, do you keep a gun here
on the premises?

07:59.322 --> 08:00.375
Please.

08:00.375 --> 08:03.434
The kids you watch, could any of them
have brought one in here?

08:03.434 --> 08:05.621
Absolutely not.

08:05.621 --> 08:07.723
You wouldn't happen to have a phone list
for the parents, would you?

08:07.723 --> 08:10.672
Of course I do.
Work and home.

08:10.672 --> 08:12.436
By the phone desk over there.

08:12.436 --> 08:14.743
Yeah, we'll need a copy of that.

08:16.698 --> 08:20.409
Rudy, it's Buddy's turn.

08:24.410 --> 08:27.722
Ma'am, are you responsible
for every kid around here?

08:27.722 --> 08:30.280
Yes. They don't talk to strangers

08:30.280 --> 08:33.077
they don't leave the courtyard
without an adult.

08:33.077 --> 08:36.361
I take my job very seriously,
young man.

08:36.539 --> 08:40.232
Okay, Sammy,
where did Elias get the gun?

08:40.232 --> 08:41.993
From his pants.

08:41.993 --> 08:44.142
- Before that?
- I don't know.

08:44.142 --> 08:46.265
- Did he ever talk about having a gun?
- No.

08:46.265 --> 08:49.716
When's the first time you saw the gun?

08:50.644 --> 08:52.854
When he shot Carly.

08:52.854 --> 08:55.379
Why did Elias shoot Carly?

08:55.531 --> 08:56.980
I don't know.

08:56.980 --> 08:59.416
She pick on him a lot?

09:00.386 --> 09:03.539
She kissed him all the time.

09:04.030 --> 09:06.396
What would he do
when she kissed him?

09:06.396 --> 09:08.410
His face would get all red.

09:08.410 --> 09:10.989
Did she try to kiss him that day?

09:10.989 --> 09:13.644
She was walking over.

09:13.935 --> 09:16.288
Cabot's hell bent
on charging the parents.

09:16.288 --> 09:17.554
Parental responsibility.

09:17.554 --> 09:19.359
It's a hot-button issue.
That's all it is.

09:19.359 --> 09:22.301
- Well, we've got no ammunition for her.
- Nothing about this makes sense.

09:22.301 --> 09:24.584
Child homicides never do.

09:25.709 --> 09:28.276
What happened to that little boy to
make him want to take a life?

09:28.276 --> 09:31.030
Elliot, you're searching for
a way to make him a victim.

09:31.030 --> 09:33.934
The only victim here is
a dead little girl.

09:35.272 --> 09:36.712
Hi, can we help you?

09:36.712 --> 09:40.957
Yes, I'm Sonia Paredes,
Elias Barrera's teacher.

09:41.260 --> 09:45.864
The limit for class size is supposed
to be 32 students. I have 40.

09:45.864 --> 09:48.824
It must make it kind of hard to give
each student the attention they need.

09:48.824 --> 09:50.594
Impossible.

09:50.594 --> 09:53.722
I was in the teachers' lounge
when they told us.

09:53.722 --> 09:57.093
When they said it was Elias,
I got physically ill.

09:57.093 --> 10:00.571
Mrs. Paredes, is there something
that you want to show us?

10:00.918 --> 10:05.317
After 20 years of teaching,
nothing shocks you anymore.

10:05.317 --> 10:07.311
I wish this had.

10:10.365 --> 10:12.690
When did he draw this?

10:12.690 --> 10:14.714
Yesterday.

10:15.820 --> 10:18.401
Carly had a ponytail.

10:18.965 --> 10:21.259
Office of Chief Assistant District Attorney
Charlie Phillips
Tuesday, November 7

10:21.259 --> 10:23.036
- Charge the boy.
- With what?

10:23.036 --> 10:24.730
- Murder.
- He's seven.

10:24.730 --> 10:26.045
Yes, and if he were six,

10:26.045 --> 10:28.275
I would send him home with his parents
as the law mandates.

10:28.275 --> 10:31.940
But he's not.
The law is not interpretive, Counselor.

10:31.940 --> 10:34.864
It is to be very narrowly construed.
He can be charged.

10:34.864 --> 10:36.844
He can, but you know as well as I do

10:36.844 --> 10:38.763
that the youngest
they've ever convicted was 11.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.299
Yes, but that was pre-Columbine.

10:40.299 --> 10:42.398
Since then, there's been an epidemic of

10:42.398 --> 10:45.082
ever younger kids killing kids
with no consequence.

10:45.082 --> 10:46.407
People are fed up with it.

10:46.407 --> 10:49.305
And you're bored of being
the Chief Assistant DA.

10:49.305 --> 10:52.003
I know you're looking to replace
Lewin next fall but let me tell you,

10:52.003 --> 10:53.428
if you think you could put
a little boy in jail

10:53.428 --> 10:57.200
just so you can prove you're tough
on crime, you've got to be kidding.

10:59.700 --> 11:02.985
He's old enough to know the
difference between right and wrong.

11:02.985 --> 11:05.646
But not to understand the
consequences of his actions.

11:05.646 --> 11:07.744
He brought a gun to school.

11:07.744 --> 11:09.305
He knew what he was doing.

11:09.305 --> 11:13.465
And this, that gives us intent.

11:14.345 --> 11:16.459
Why don't you just apply for
a change of venue to Texas

11:16.459 --> 11:17.949
so we can have him executed?

11:17.949 --> 11:21.222
No, Manhattan Family Court
will be sufficient.

11:23.257 --> 11:27.013
Ms. Cabot, am I reading this right
you're charging a 7-year-old with murder?

11:27.013 --> 11:28.399
Yes, Your Honor.

11:28.399 --> 11:30.706
Surely there's an alternative.

11:30.706 --> 11:32.950
One has yet to present itself.

11:32.950 --> 11:35.904
The commission of the crime
by the respondent is undisputed.

11:35.904 --> 11:39.803
And evidence supporting criminal intent
has just come to light.

11:39.803 --> 11:41.232
How does the minor plead?

11:41.232 --> 11:43.407
General denial, Your Honor.

11:43.407 --> 11:44.923
Remand recommendations?

11:44.923 --> 11:48.771
The People have not ruled out the minor's
home situation as a contributing factor.

11:48.771 --> 11:51.281
We therefore ask for the removal
of the minor from his home

11:51.281 --> 11:54.262
and ask that he be remanded to
a detention facility Pending trial.

11:54.262 --> 11:57.644
Your Honor, the Barreras are a loving,
law-abiding, nuclear family.

11:57.644 --> 12:01.029
- Elias should be released into their custody.
- The Barreras have ties outside the country.

12:01.029 --> 12:03.224
Flight risk is a significant issue
with the People

12:03.224 --> 12:06.333
and the victim's family
who is here today.

12:06.333 --> 12:10.207
I'm ordering the minor be remanded
to the Wagner Detention Facility.

12:10.207 --> 12:13.377
I'm further ordering a clinical evaluation
to determine whether or

12:13.377 --> 12:18.521
not he understands the charges against him
and can help in his own defense.

12:19.092 --> 12:21.497
No! Please, don't take my baby.

12:21.497 --> 12:23.597
Mommy! / Oh, please!

12:38.785 --> 12:42.550
Olivia, can you believe
they ran this picture?

12:42.550 --> 12:45.815
Already a couple of hundred people
hanging outside the courthouse.

12:45.815 --> 12:49.727
Who'd have guessed there'd be backlash
against charging a 7-year-old with murder?

12:49.727 --> 12:52.921
Amnesty International,
Children's Defense Fund.

12:52.921 --> 12:55.493
- Alex Cabot.
- I didn't want to charge him with murder.

12:55.493 --> 12:56.921
I didn't have any choice.

12:56.921 --> 13:00.185
Now that you've got him
in the big house, is he spilling?

13:00.185 --> 13:01.614
Why he did it?
Where he got the gun?

13:01.614 --> 13:03.322
No, he's completely withdrawn.

13:03.322 --> 13:04.894
He won't even talk to the social worker.

13:04.894 --> 13:07.147
How about spending less time
on the kid we caught,

13:07.147 --> 13:09.233
more on the adult we didn't.

13:09.233 --> 13:11.124
What did we send License Division?

13:11.124 --> 13:14.264
The names of parents of the other kids
Mrs. Strada watches.

13:14.264 --> 13:18.120
Really? Well, guess
what Reyna McCreary owns?

13:18.120 --> 13:20.332
He did not get that gun from my son.

13:20.332 --> 13:22.677
The gun registered in your name is
still in your possession?

13:22.677 --> 13:23.911
Yes, it is.

13:23.911 --> 13:26.938
- You mind if we take a peek at it?
- Yes, I do.

13:28.420 --> 13:30.145
There. You satisfied?

13:30.145 --> 13:32.545
Put the gun down on the table.

13:33.729 --> 13:35.813
You carry that around in your purse?

13:35.813 --> 13:38.906
You know, sometimes I don't leave
the hospital till 3:00 a.m.

13:38.906 --> 13:40.656
I have to take a subway, a bus

13:40.656 --> 13:43.147
and walk four blocks through this
neighborhood to get home.

13:43.147 --> 13:45.567
You know, carrying a concealed
weapon is a felony.

13:45.567 --> 13:48.697
I don't. I leave it here so the appliances
can defend themselves.

13:48.697 --> 13:52.197
You have a child living here.
You have a safe place to store this gun?

13:52.197 --> 13:53.931
Of course I do.

13:54.101 --> 13:55.885
Raphael. Get a move on.

13:55.885 --> 13:59.572
- We're leaving in 10 seconds.
- Coming.

14:00.801 --> 14:03.214
What's up? Raphael, right?

14:03.214 --> 14:05.689
- Yeah.
- You know Elias?

14:05.689 --> 14:06.911
Yeah.

14:06.911 --> 14:08.591
You heard about what happened?

14:08.591 --> 14:11.034
Yeah, he popped that little girl.

14:12.295 --> 14:14.548
Lightweight, compact hammerless.

14:14.548 --> 14:16.561
So simple,
even a 7-year-old can use it.

14:16.561 --> 14:17.908
This one especially.

14:17.908 --> 14:20.347
Safety's tampered with, hair trigger.

14:20.347 --> 14:21.960
Gangbanger, drug dealer.

14:21.960 --> 14:25.611
Doesn't have the overkill they're partial to,
but not bad as a backup piece.

14:25.611 --> 14:27.058
Chambered round fits.

14:27.058 --> 14:30.394
Add a full clip, they get that
one extra bang for the buck.

14:30.394 --> 14:32.406
And speaking of the bang...

14:33.286 --> 14:36.829
the bullet Rodgers sent us,
after the autopsy.

14:37.624 --> 14:38.559
Hollow point?

14:38.559 --> 14:41.306
See the smooth edges
where it peeled apart on impact?

14:41.306 --> 14:45.201
The tip was filed down in
an "X" pattern, by hand.

14:45.201 --> 14:48.546
- Little girl didn't have a chance.
- Neither did this guy.

14:49.729 --> 14:51.277
It's hard to compare
the lands and grooves

14:51.277 --> 14:54.006
because of their condition,
but look at the base.

14:54.006 --> 14:55.849
Here's a side-by-side comparison.

14:55.849 --> 14:58.331
Same right twist, same riflings.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.183
Where'd you get this one from?

15:00.183 --> 15:02.041
A 23-year-old.

15:02.041 --> 15:04.812
Your gun's got a second body on it.

15:06.075 --> 15:08.881
23rd Precinct Detective Squad
Wednesday, November 8

15:08.881 --> 15:11.361
Shorty Esposito.
Latino male, 23.

15:11.361 --> 15:12.841
Got smoked in the ticker.

15:12.841 --> 15:15.191
Night before your case. Close range.

15:15.191 --> 15:17.509
Got dumped in an alley a couple
of blocks from where your kid lives.

15:17.509 --> 15:19.924
- You getting anywhere with it?
- No, the case is cold.

15:19.924 --> 15:23.192
We were hoping maybe your
7-year-old did our guy, too.

15:23.192 --> 15:24.451
How do we know he didn't?

15:24.451 --> 15:27.744
M.E. Makes our shooter a good
four inches taller than our stiff, so...

15:27.744 --> 15:29.727
Want to swap five's?

15:31.291 --> 15:34.666
Two busts for drug possession,
just short of enough for intent to sell.

15:34.666 --> 15:37.580
Mother swears by all known saints
he wasn't a dealer.

15:37.580 --> 15:39.307
We think drug deal gone south.

15:39.307 --> 15:41.407
Let's canvass the area
between these two.

15:41.407 --> 15:42.791
Got to be a link in there somewhere.

15:42.791 --> 15:45.391
Hold on. Elliot, look at his pants.

15:46.053 --> 15:48.018
This can't be a coincidence.

15:48.018 --> 15:50.481
Heck, we might have just found our link.

15:53.009 --> 15:54.683
Yeah, that guy I maybe seen around.

15:54.683 --> 15:56.322
Tell me about him.

15:57.157 --> 16:00.001
He likes bubble baths and long walks.

16:00.001 --> 16:02.011
I don't know jack about him.
I seen him on the block.

16:02.011 --> 16:04.277
With anyone in particular?

16:04.523 --> 16:06.710
- You been following this story?
- Who hasn't.

16:06.710 --> 16:09.483
Little boy who shot this girl
did it with the same gun

16:09.483 --> 16:12.699
that was used to whack this guy.
Tell us what you know about this guy?

16:12.699 --> 16:13.891
I know nothing about the guy.

16:13.891 --> 16:15.687
The stuff he was into,
I don't want to know.

16:15.687 --> 16:18.004
And what stuff would that be?

16:18.171 --> 16:20.161
Mumbo jumbo.

16:20.961 --> 16:24.346
Whenever I seen him,
he's coming out of Nestor's.

16:31.446 --> 16:32.880
You Nestor?

16:32.880 --> 16:36.082
Nicky Crow. Nestor sold me
the business last year.

16:36.426 --> 16:38.449
And exactly what kind
of business is this?

16:38.449 --> 16:41.824
Religious supplies.
For the practice of Santeria.

16:41.824 --> 16:44.648
Then those would be
sacrificial chickens.

16:44.648 --> 16:47.082
It's legal. Santeros won
their Supreme Court case.

16:47.082 --> 16:49.842
Relax, we're not from the ASPCA.

16:50.386 --> 16:53.206
- You know him?
- Yeah, he's a customer.

16:53.206 --> 16:55.136
Was. Know anything about it?

16:55.136 --> 16:58.902
Santeros don't sacrifice anything
further up the food chain than goats.

16:58.902 --> 17:00.910
Long Island cheerleader three years ago.

17:00.910 --> 17:03.067
Mother and sister thought she was
possessed by a demon

17:03.067 --> 17:05.500
and they suffocated her.
Santeras, right?

17:05.500 --> 17:08.608
That was an exorcism got out of hand,
not a sacrifice.

17:08.608 --> 17:12.178
Shorty Esposito, religious kind of guy?

17:12.178 --> 17:14.035
Keeping the rituals a secret
comes from the slaves

17:14.035 --> 17:17.137
having to hide it from their masters.

17:17.316 --> 17:18.857
That's not an answer.

17:18.857 --> 17:22.269
Sure it is. It's in the Constitution.
Freedom of religion.

17:22.269 --> 17:24.342
It's like dogma not to talk about it.

17:24.342 --> 17:25.560
I'd be violating his rights.

17:25.560 --> 17:28.511
He's dead.
He doesn't have any rights.

17:29.197 --> 17:31.352
You a priest?

17:31.658 --> 17:33.292
A Babalu?

17:33.607 --> 17:35.176
Babalu.

17:35.176 --> 17:36.938
Atheist. Businessman.

17:36.938 --> 17:40.198
300,000 people practice
Santeria in New York.

17:40.198 --> 17:42.989
They need to shop someplace
they can trust.

17:43.954 --> 17:47.063
Hey, maybe someone tried to drive
an evil spirit out of him with a bullet.

17:47.063 --> 17:49.650
My bet?
That was his religion.

17:49.650 --> 17:51.428
That guy right there on the corner,
that's the steerer.

17:51.428 --> 17:54.120
He brings the buyer to the money man.

17:54.515 --> 17:56.812
And him hanging back
with the gold chain...

17:56.812 --> 17:59.795
that's the money man.
He never touches the dope.

17:59.795 --> 18:02.946
They're all teens. Maybe they know
Elias through a little brother.

18:02.946 --> 18:04.209
Somewhere around here.

18:04.209 --> 18:06.691
911!

18:06.691 --> 18:08.453
He's the lookout.

18:14.966 --> 18:16.685
- What's your name, man?
- Sammy.

18:16.685 --> 18:18.829
- Sammy what?
- Sosa.

18:18.829 --> 18:20.995
That's Mrs. Morales' boy, Jamal.

18:20.995 --> 18:22.201
Shut up, old man.

18:22.201 --> 18:24.197
Hey, Jamal, you just focus all right.

18:24.197 --> 18:26.039
- You know this kid?
- No.

18:26.039 --> 18:27.454
- What about him?
- Nope.

18:27.454 --> 18:28.906
Hey, how old are you?

18:28.906 --> 18:30.486
Ten.

18:31.057 --> 18:34.184
Why don't you talk to him?
Come here a second.

18:34.699 --> 18:36.416
Know his name?

18:38.204 --> 18:40.913
Bobby Cruise.

18:41.805 --> 18:45.041
- He's in here all the time.
- Yeah, with him?

18:45.293 --> 18:47.531
No, another one of those boys.

18:47.531 --> 18:50.934
Eighteen or 19 years old.
Called Sweetness.

18:50.934 --> 18:52.242
Sweetness?

18:52.242 --> 18:54.531
Real sweet tooth.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.483
We saw Homicide.
They aren't doing any better.

18:57.483 --> 18:58.798
Any luck on our sweet tooth?

18:58.798 --> 19:00.550
Former juvenile offender.
Now 19.

19:00.550 --> 19:02.712
Placed in foster care at age eight.

19:02.712 --> 19:04.212
Truancy. Shoplifting.

19:04.212 --> 19:07.766
Moving up to drugs,
larceny, gun possession.

19:07.766 --> 19:09.186
Given name is Antonio Strada.

19:09.186 --> 19:12.139
Last person who posted bail
was his great grandmother.

19:12.139 --> 19:14.331
Good old Mrs. Strada.

19:16.185 --> 19:19.982
My great-grandson has nothing to
do with that little girl's death.

19:19.982 --> 19:23.699
Mrs. Strada, you know
Elias got hold of a gun.

19:23.699 --> 19:25.143
And you know, as well as we do,

19:25.143 --> 19:27.964
that Antonio has had gun troubles
in the past.

19:27.964 --> 19:30.016
Once. / Twice.

19:31.062 --> 19:33.135
He's changed.

19:33.508 --> 19:36.150
He's getting his life together.

19:36.990 --> 19:39.844
He helps me with the kids.
Takes them to the park for me.

19:39.844 --> 19:41.990
He buys them candy.

19:41.990 --> 19:44.457
The kids call him Sweetness.

19:44.457 --> 19:49.739
The candy store that he takes Elias
to alone is off a known drug corner.

19:49.739 --> 19:51.724
Did you know that, Mrs. Strada?

19:51.724 --> 19:55.692
No, l... / Sunday night, a young man
named Shorty...

19:55.692 --> 19:59.248
was shot and killed with the same gun
Elias used to kill Carly Jackson.

19:59.248 --> 20:00.986
The last time your great-grandson

20:00.986 --> 20:03.525
was arrested for gun possession
he was with Shorty.

20:03.525 --> 20:06.166
They did time together.

20:06.166 --> 20:09.226
Mrs. Strada, tell us where he is.

20:12.887 --> 20:17.622
You don't understand,
he had a horrible childhood.

20:17.622 --> 20:21.420
His father was in prison, his mother

20:21.420 --> 20:24.774
who knows where his mother was.

20:30.306 --> 20:34.854
Please, don't hurt him.

20:47.938 --> 20:51.033
Antonio, police.
We want to talk to you.

20:54.549 --> 20:56.561
Sweetness?

21:03.470 --> 21:05.522
Nobody in here.
Got blood on the walls.

21:05.522 --> 21:07.829
Yeah, we got fresh blood right here.

21:07.829 --> 21:12.414
We need backup.
Two-five-two, East 132.

21:15.900 --> 21:17.858
Body's down here.

21:36.570 --> 21:38.316
It's him.

21:39.473 --> 21:41.433
I need an ambulance now.

21:41.433 --> 21:43.112
Who did this to you?

21:43.112 --> 21:46.158
Who cut you, Sweetness?
Who cut you?

21:46.158 --> 21:50.835
Machete. Machete.

22:01.214 --> 22:03.309
What'd he say?

22:07.822 --> 22:10.384
I think he said Machet...

22:10.384 --> 22:14.273
Machete. Machete.

22:19.270 --> 22:21.956
Look at the pants,
they're both camouflage.

22:21.956 --> 22:23.760
This is not Carly, this is Shorty.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.541
Meaning, Elias witnessed this murder.

22:25.541 --> 22:26.903
When he drew this,

22:26.903 --> 22:29.332
he wasn't plotting out
Carly Jackson's murder.

22:29.332 --> 22:32.492
This was a cry for help. He wanted
somebody to know what he saw.

22:32.492 --> 22:34.053
He's been through an interrogation,

22:34.053 --> 22:37.075
a court hearing taken from his family
and placed in detention.

22:37.075 --> 22:38.641
Why wouldn't he have said
something by now?

22:38.641 --> 22:41.554
Look at the players involved.
Drug dealers and killers.

22:41.554 --> 22:43.540
If Elias was drawn into this world at all,

22:43.540 --> 22:45.715
he knows what happens
to people who talk.

22:45.715 --> 22:47.099
So what are we going to do?

22:47.099 --> 22:48.402
When an accused stands mute,

22:48.402 --> 22:51.281
the only thing the system can do
is interpret his actions.

22:51.281 --> 22:54.216
- You know our take on it.
- Well, I know what my boss' will be.

22:54.216 --> 22:57.064
He'll still see a bad apple who
likes seeing people dead.

22:57.064 --> 22:59.565
So Elias needs to talk.

23:00.721 --> 23:02.766
His attorney won his motion.

23:02.766 --> 23:05.369
He's back home until the hearing.

23:05.805 --> 23:07.290
Go.

23:08.326 --> 23:10.419
You know, you people have some nerve!

23:10.419 --> 23:11.965
It's been horrible for the Barreras.

23:11.965 --> 23:13.653
They're prisoners in their own home.

23:13.653 --> 23:17.146
The protesters, death threats,
the media trying to sneak into the building.

23:17.146 --> 23:19.085
You know, we try to
be good parents, we do.

23:19.085 --> 23:22.801
Social services is threatening
to remove their baby girl.

23:22.801 --> 23:25.238
Mr. Barrera,
it is imperative we talk to Elias.

23:25.238 --> 23:27.577
Why, so you can find something
else to charge him with?

23:27.577 --> 23:32.991
Mrs. Barrera, we believe that your son
witnessed a murder the night before the shooting.

23:33.881 --> 23:35.934
What?

23:39.020 --> 23:41.154
Oh, my God!

23:50.579 --> 23:52.266
Stay back.

23:56.944 --> 24:00.908
Elias, you remember me, Elliot?

24:02.192 --> 24:04.500
How are you doing?

24:05.940 --> 24:08.602
We got a problem here, big man.

24:10.469 --> 24:13.508
I hear you've been dragged into
something bad.

24:13.508 --> 24:15.524
Me and Sweetness, we talked.

24:15.524 --> 24:20.803
Now, he says he's got you
all hooked up and slinging for him.

24:23.238 --> 24:27.098
What do you do with all the money
that he gives you?

24:27.584 --> 24:30.958
Well, you buy games,
new kicks, what?

24:31.122 --> 24:33.527
Crayons?

24:36.796 --> 24:39.594
Okay, Elias. Your parents know
about everything.

24:39.594 --> 24:42.370
But you and me, right now...

24:42.370 --> 24:47.970
Elias, you and me have got to fix this.

24:54.820 --> 24:59.069
He puts little bottles in my pockets.

24:59.620 --> 25:01.587
Okay, that's good.

25:01.587 --> 25:04.587
You're doing great.
Now, you and me...

25:07.617 --> 25:10.367
let's talk about the gun, okay.

25:11.225 --> 25:13.431
Tell me about this.

25:18.442 --> 25:21.375
He told me to stay in the room.

25:21.375 --> 25:26.366
I didn't. I saw him shoot the man.

25:27.735 --> 25:30.877
Okay. What's that at the end of the gun?

25:30.877 --> 25:35.567
A pillow.
You could hardly hear the bang.

25:38.240 --> 25:41.500
Why did Sweetness shoot Shorty?

25:41.500 --> 25:43.587
He didn't.

25:44.348 --> 25:47.250
Isn't that him holding the gun?

25:49.086 --> 25:51.266
Well, who is it?

25:51.266 --> 25:53.496
Machete.

25:56.196 --> 25:57.923
What did you say?

25:57.923 --> 25:59.967
Machete.

25:59.967 --> 26:02.493
Do you know Machete?

26:02.687 --> 26:04.772
Well, how do you know his name?

26:04.772 --> 26:08.968
I heard Shorty say, "Stop, Machete,
don't, please, don't. Stop."

26:08.968 --> 26:10.534
And then what happened?

26:10.534 --> 26:15.743
I heard sirens,
and Machete ran away.

26:15.743 --> 26:18.229
And what happened to the gun?

26:18.229 --> 26:20.480
Sweetness hid it in the couch.

26:20.480 --> 26:24.177
And then he got a big suitcase.

26:24.177 --> 26:27.341
And I hid in the closet
because I was scared.

26:27.341 --> 26:28.964
Then what happened?

26:28.964 --> 26:31.977
I heard him leave.

26:35.816 --> 26:38.930
Why did you take the gun?

26:39.899 --> 26:43.721
I didn't want him to kill me, too.

26:45.988 --> 26:47.374
Okay.

26:47.665 --> 26:52.817
Okay. Now, this is very important.
Where did this happen?

26:56.802 --> 27:00.979
My sister was in the hospital.

27:02.763 --> 27:06.415
And you were at Mrs. Strada's?

27:09.065 --> 27:10.725
Mrs. Strada?

27:11.329 --> 27:13.306
What is going on?
No one is telling me anything.

27:13.306 --> 27:16.057
Mrs. Strada,
where were you Sunday night?

27:16.057 --> 27:18.743
Sunday... / Sunday between
10:00 and midnight.

27:18.743 --> 27:21.647
- I was asleep.
- Are you a sound sleeper?

27:21.647 --> 27:26.763
Well, I take meclizine at night.
It knocks me out.

27:27.092 --> 27:29.134
Hey, anything?

27:29.134 --> 27:31.915
Dried pee, Cheerios.

27:31.915 --> 27:34.386
- Old lady got kids?
- She takes care of them.

27:34.386 --> 27:36.790
Our guy apparently cleaned up
after himself.

27:36.790 --> 27:39.905
Make sure you check sinks,
drains, traps, sponges.

27:39.905 --> 27:41.969
Trash cans, light switches,

27:41.969 --> 27:44.239
even lifted a few base boards.

27:44.239 --> 27:46.202
No trace of blood yet.

27:46.202 --> 27:47.865
Pillow's missing.

27:47.865 --> 27:50.428
Okay, close the curtains.

27:52.944 --> 27:54.983
We got blood.

27:56.356 --> 27:59.245
- Wheel marks.
- Yeah.

28:00.044 --> 28:03.618
Like the kind on a big-ass suitcase.

28:03.800 --> 28:06.448
They just stuffed old Shorty in there and
wheeled him on out.

28:06.448 --> 28:09.604
Elias was right about the suitcase.
He also said he heard sirens.

28:09.604 --> 28:12.169
Let's find out what that problem was.

28:12.571 --> 28:15.150
15th Precinct Detective Squad
Thursday, November 9

28:15.150 --> 28:17.592
Party out of hand.
Somebody pulled out a knife.

28:17.592 --> 28:19.917
Somebody else pulls out
a Louisville Slugger.

28:19.917 --> 28:22.117
Brawl spilled out into the courtyard.

28:22.117 --> 28:23.677
You take any statements?

28:23.677 --> 28:25.718
Thirty-five.

28:26.020 --> 28:27.698
Stopped everyone leaving the building.

28:27.698 --> 28:30.815
If that's when our guy left the building,
he might be one of them.

28:30.815 --> 28:32.819
Mind if we borrow these?

28:33.161 --> 28:34.413
Great.

28:34.961 --> 28:39.063
Off Elias' description, we've eliminated
28 names based on age and gender.

28:39.063 --> 28:42.224
Which were brought down to
eight suspects, five of whom have records.

28:42.224 --> 28:43.564
And mug shots.

28:43.564 --> 28:47.138
Already there, we put together
a photo array, showed it to Elias.

28:47.138 --> 28:49.301
- He recognize any of them?
- Yeah, two.

28:49.301 --> 28:52.162
Unless I'm one of them, I don't know
why you're still standing here.

28:52.162 --> 28:54.657
Because he's positive
neither of them is Machete.

28:54.657 --> 28:57.116
So who do we have left?

28:57.116 --> 28:59.218
The three who didn't have records,
so no photos.

28:59.218 --> 29:02.046
Kyung Kwon, Nicky Crow,
and Bobby Cruise.

29:02.046 --> 29:04.329
We've met them all,
all on the selfsame corner.

29:04.329 --> 29:06.114
So one of them's Machete.

29:06.114 --> 29:09.054
Kwon owns a market, and was pretty
helpful in getting us some IDs.

29:09.054 --> 29:10.443
Yeah, maybe too helpful.

29:10.443 --> 29:13.116
Crow profits off the piety
of the local Santeros.

29:13.116 --> 29:14.588
Cruise is a dope dealer.

29:14.588 --> 29:16.723
Elias needs some points
with the DA's office.

29:16.723 --> 29:20.122
Call his attorney, see
if he'll let him do some walk bys.

29:20.122 --> 29:21.596
Okay. / Okay.

29:24.976 --> 29:28.432
Okay. Are you up for this, champ?

29:28.432 --> 29:30.638
Is he gonna see me?

29:31.267 --> 29:35.104
Keep your mask down.
Don't say anything, okay?

29:35.104 --> 29:38.558
If you recognize any of these men
as Machete, just squeeze my hand, okay?

29:38.558 --> 29:40.802
- Okay.
- All right. Come on.

29:50.511 --> 29:52.253
Hello.

29:52.253 --> 29:54.815
I'll be with you in a second.

29:57.200 --> 29:59.117
Hey. / Hey.

30:03.260 --> 30:04.768
Take him outside.

30:05.809 --> 30:08.309
Nicky Crow, you're under arrest
for the murder... / What're you doing?

30:08.309 --> 30:10.248
- of Shorty Esposito.
- Hold it.

30:10.248 --> 30:12.311
- You have the right to remain silent.
- Look in the refrigerator.

30:12.311 --> 30:15.113
- Yeah, we're not hungry.
- I never met one who wasn't.

30:15.113 --> 30:16.408
Go.

30:16.693 --> 30:18.191
In the fridge?

30:18.191 --> 30:20.954
- Behind the box.
- Behind the box.

30:21.688 --> 30:23.550
- What do we got?
- I'm a business man.

30:23.550 --> 30:26.991
Take it. Leave.
Call it cost of doing business.

30:27.288 --> 30:29.409
Call it Class B felony.

30:30.939 --> 30:33.681
Office of Dr.Elizabeth Olivet
Friday, November 10

30:33.681 --> 30:35.518
It's okay to talk now.

30:35.518 --> 30:39.381
Machete can't hurt you.
He's in jail.

30:44.716 --> 30:48.497
I hear you're a very good artist.

30:50.721 --> 30:53.653
Do you draw all the time?

30:53.653 --> 30:55.687
Yeah.

30:57.024 --> 31:03.665
Can you draw me a picture of how
you felt that day in the schoolyard?

31:32.942 --> 31:35.529
You were really scared.

31:37.826 --> 31:39.554
Why?

31:39.554 --> 31:43.295
- I saw them behind the fence.
- Who?

31:43.295 --> 31:46.161
Machete and them.

31:47.655 --> 31:50.806
What were they doing there?

31:50.806 --> 31:54.278
They came to hurt me, too.

31:55.762 --> 31:57.722
Elias...

31:58.264 --> 32:01.540
who were you shooting at?

32:02.638 --> 32:05.019
Machete.

32:05.019 --> 32:08.193
I didn't mean to shoot Carly.

32:08.193 --> 32:11.644
What's going to happen to me?

32:14.753 --> 32:18.448
What do you think should
happen to you?

32:40.594 --> 32:42.688
What's that?

32:44.112 --> 32:46.382
Hell.

32:49.186 --> 32:53.998
You think you're going to burn
in Hell for what you did?

33:00.558 --> 33:03.026
I know why you're here.

33:03.380 --> 33:04.365
Well, forget it.

33:04.365 --> 33:07.221
I already gave Machete to McCoy.

33:07.221 --> 33:09.583
You should have seen his face.
It was the same look my dog...

33:09.583 --> 33:13.194
I'm not here to pick up a case,
I'm here to drop one.

33:13.530 --> 33:15.599
Oh, no, we can't give that kid a free ride.

33:15.599 --> 33:18.084
We only got Machete
because of Elias' drawing.

33:18.084 --> 33:20.074
That doesn't bring Carly Jackson back.

33:20.074 --> 33:22.110
Her death is a tragedy, yes,

33:22.110 --> 33:23.742
but it was self-defense.

33:23.742 --> 33:25.954
The vice principal
at the school corroborates his story.

33:25.954 --> 33:27.589
Machete and his gang were there.

33:27.589 --> 33:30.513
Did she see them attack him?
Draw a weapon?

33:30.513 --> 33:32.741
This is what he thinks is going
to happen to him.

33:32.741 --> 33:34.872
Well, I think that makes your case

33:34.872 --> 33:37.773
and proves that he knows the
difference between right and wrong.

33:37.773 --> 33:41.059
No, we are the ones
who don't know the difference...

33:41.587 --> 33:43.518
I'll be right there.

33:44.812 --> 33:46.912
Fine, amend the charges to manslaughter.

33:46.912 --> 33:51.557
I don't want to prosecute a child at all
for a series of society's mistakes.

33:51.557 --> 33:53.964
The Barrera's HMO wouldn't cover
their baby's condition

33:53.964 --> 33:55.534
forcing them to work two jobs.

33:55.534 --> 33:59.175
They had to find affordable daycare for
Elias which we both know is nonexistent.

33:59.175 --> 34:01.349
So they put him in
Mrs. Strada's illegal daycare.

34:01.349 --> 34:03.881
An 82-year-old woman
looking after 15 children

34:03.881 --> 34:06.392
whose great-grandson was using
Elias as a drug runner

34:06.392 --> 34:10.855
and giving him access to
a loaded semi-automatic handgun.

34:10.855 --> 34:14.141
And don't get me started
on the accessibility of handguns to minors.

34:14.141 --> 34:15.746
This boy should not be put away.

34:15.746 --> 34:18.891
Nobody in Sing Sing had
a great childhood, Ms. Cabot.

34:18.891 --> 34:22.413
You start killing at seven,
it's not a bad predictor.

34:24.090 --> 34:25.710
You are unbelievable.

34:25.710 --> 34:29.877
No, I am second-in-command and
I have Lewin's full support in this.

34:29.877 --> 34:32.876
Now, listen, people know what happened.
They want justice.

34:32.876 --> 34:36.503
I need someone held responsible.

34:44.308 --> 34:49.156
The death of Carly Jackson
is the ultimate tragedy.

34:49.156 --> 34:51.462
There are no easy solutions,

34:51.462 --> 34:56.922
but we in the DA's office have
a moral imperative to do the right thing

34:56.922 --> 35:01.901
and I assure you that justice
will be served.

35:01.901 --> 35:07.152
I am placing full authority
in the worthy hands

35:07.152 --> 35:11.285
of a person who has been intimately
involved with every aspect

35:11.285 --> 35:14.653
of the case from the beginning.

35:14.653 --> 35:19.290
Assistant District Attorney Alex Cabot.

35:19.953 --> 35:23.221
Will you be prosecuting
7-year-old Elias Barrera?

35:23.221 --> 35:25.725
A Latino boy killed
an African-American girl.

35:25.725 --> 35:28.462
Are you at all concerned that
if you don't prosecute

35:28.462 --> 35:32.206
it may ignite tensions
in the neighborhood?

35:33.227 --> 35:36.187
We know this was in
no way racially motivated.

35:36.187 --> 35:39.134
I'm sure no responsible
member of the press

35:39.134 --> 35:42.488
would even think to put
that kind of slant on it.

35:42.488 --> 35:43.831
He hung her out to dry.

35:43.831 --> 35:46.384
No matter what she does to Elias,
it's lose, lose.

35:46.384 --> 35:47.776
Half the city's going to hate her.

35:47.776 --> 35:50.076
The other half won't
be turning back flips.

35:50.076 --> 35:53.179
I talked to the Barreras, Elias was
formally expelled from school.

35:53.179 --> 35:55.603
- The State sent a tutor.
- Don't let that get out.

35:55.603 --> 35:58.134
The state of our educational system
people will be killing to get one.

35:58.134 --> 35:59.781
Is there anything we can do for Cabot?

35:59.781 --> 36:02.851
We've exhausted the pool
of sacrificial heads for the platter.

36:02.851 --> 36:07.272
It's out of our hands. She needs
to look at alternate solutions.

36:07.507 --> 36:09.432
Liz, my career's on the line here.

36:09.432 --> 36:11.229
And a little boy's future.

36:11.229 --> 36:13.617
Believe me,
I haven't forgotten about him.

36:13.617 --> 36:15.718
I can't believe my boss did this to me.

36:15.718 --> 36:17.483
That's what they do at the boy's club.

36:17.483 --> 36:19.185
Why do you think I left?

36:19.185 --> 36:20.716
What would you do?

36:20.716 --> 36:23.221
I really shouldn't discuss
the particulars with you

36:23.221 --> 36:25.405
while I'm on retainer by the defense.

36:25.405 --> 36:27.592
Hypothetically.

36:27.779 --> 36:31.073
I wouldn't make him another throw-away
kid and just warehouse him.

36:31.073 --> 36:33.532
I'd put him in supervised counseling.

36:33.532 --> 36:35.906
That's not going to sate
the public's bloodlust.

36:35.906 --> 36:38.301
Someone has to be punished.

36:38.448 --> 36:40.789
You know, I had a political future
at one point.

36:40.789 --> 36:44.696
Alex, the historical figures I respect the most
aren't the ones who started wars,

36:44.696 --> 36:46.927
but those who brought about peace.

36:46.927 --> 36:50.042
You have a real opportunity here.

36:52.399 --> 36:55.696
Family Court Capacity Hearing
Monday, November 13

36:55.696 --> 36:59.190
The respondent clearly understands
the difference between right and wrong.

36:59.190 --> 37:01.855
At the time he pulled the trigger,
he knew what he was doing.

37:01.855 --> 37:05.879
He intended to cause physical injury
or death to the boys at the fence.

37:05.879 --> 37:08.325
Yes, he absolutely knows
what's going on here.

37:08.325 --> 37:11.154
He understands the role of the court
he understands the role of the Judge

37:11.154 --> 37:12.710
he knows his attorney is
here to help him.

37:12.710 --> 37:15.978
He has the capacity to
assist in his own defense.

37:15.978 --> 37:20.674
Dr. Olivet, have you reviewed
the State examiners' reports?

37:20.674 --> 37:21.748
I have.

37:21.748 --> 37:24.253
Well, do you concur with their findings?

37:24.253 --> 37:25.838
They're absolutely right.

37:25.838 --> 37:27.850
He does understand
the procedures of the court

37:27.850 --> 37:29.982
and he knows his conduct was wrong.

37:29.982 --> 37:31.871
But in my assessment, the minor...

37:31.871 --> 37:36.233
he knows it was wrong, but at the time
he pulled that trigger, he did not.

37:36.233 --> 37:38.826
I have no more questions.

37:40.743 --> 37:44.121
Dr. Olivet, you're familiar
with the People's exhibit "H"?

37:44.121 --> 37:47.060
Very familiar.
I had him draw it.

37:47.060 --> 37:49.326
And what exactly did
you ask him to draw?

37:49.326 --> 37:52.461
A portrait of himself
at the time of the crime.

37:52.461 --> 37:55.492
There was no mention of fire
in the police report.

37:55.492 --> 37:59.383
He added that to the picture when I asked
what he thought should happen to him.

37:59.383 --> 38:02.531
And what do the flames represent?

38:03.033 --> 38:04.516
Hell.

38:04.516 --> 38:09.595
That's taking the consequences of
his actions to the ultimate extreme, isn't it?

38:09.595 --> 38:12.314
Obviously, he has the capacity
to understand.

38:12.314 --> 38:15.350
All children have some grasp
of right and wrong.

38:15.350 --> 38:16.699
I've seen children younger than seven

38:16.699 --> 38:19.633
who believe they're going to hell
because they told a fib.

38:19.633 --> 38:23.880
How do you explain his lapse in judgment
at the time he pulled the trigger?

38:23.880 --> 38:26.202
He was in mortal fear.

38:26.202 --> 38:28.687
Not only that, he was imitating behavior.

38:28.687 --> 38:33.343
He had seen these men wave a gun
to scare people, and he did the same.

38:33.343 --> 38:36.045
He just wanted them to go away.

38:36.045 --> 38:38.853
He was imitating behavior
without understanding it

38:38.853 --> 38:43.561
the danger, risks, or morality.

38:43.561 --> 38:48.292
And on what exactly do you base
your findings on his capacity?

38:48.292 --> 38:51.202
Solely on his age and development.

38:51.202 --> 38:54.205
He's 7 years old.

39:00.479 --> 39:03.769
Thank you.
You may step down.

39:13.111 --> 39:15.379
Your Honor...

39:17.167 --> 39:22.169
the People defer to
Dr. Olivet's findings...

39:22.169 --> 39:27.030
that the minor lacked the capacity
to understand the consequences
of his actions

39:27.030 --> 39:31.245
and therefore should
not be held responsible.

39:32.874 --> 39:36.724
The People are withdrawing charges?

39:36.724 --> 39:40.893
It's clear the respondent lacked
the mens rea to commit a crime.

39:40.893 --> 39:44.489
Therefore, we will not pursue the case.

39:58.697 --> 40:02.601
I know some of you are not happy
with today's decision.

40:02.601 --> 40:04.721
But there's something
I'd like you to hear.

40:04.721 --> 40:06.286
We heard you loud and clear.

40:06.286 --> 40:09.649
The killers of black children
get off scot-free!

40:09.649 --> 40:12.866
This cycle of violence has
got to stop somewhere.

40:12.866 --> 40:15.344
Let it be here.

40:19.987 --> 40:22.942
I'm Carly Jackson's mother.

40:23.136 --> 40:25.726
I know you're all here out of concern.

40:25.726 --> 40:27.707
And I thank you.

40:27.880 --> 40:30.699
But I have a favor to ask.

40:31.130 --> 40:33.475
Go home.

40:36.073 --> 40:39.400
Take care of your children.

40:46.991 --> 40:48.358
Teflon.

40:48.358 --> 40:50.503
I'm just glad the city isn't burning.

40:50.503 --> 40:53.014
You more than survived,
you're a hero.

40:53.014 --> 40:55.166
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

40:55.358 --> 40:58.351
Actually, my boss is so happy,
he said I could take Sunday off.

40:58.351 --> 41:00.012
We were on our way to McMullen's.

41:00.012 --> 41:02.859
How about we buy you
a congratulatory drink?

41:02.859 --> 41:05.034
Sure. / Great.

41:08.988 --> 41:11.114
Hey, Cap, you coming?

41:23.739 --> 41:25.860
Police, coming through.

41:26.912 --> 41:28.233
Neighbors jumped him.

41:28.233 --> 41:30.749
Would have killed him
if we hadn't been a block away.

41:31.439 --> 41:33.191
Who is he? A relative?

41:33.191 --> 41:35.310
- Outraged citizen.
- How old is he?

41:35.310 --> 41:38.233
Twelve. Name's Thomas James.
Goes by TJ.

41:38.233 --> 41:39.431
Anyone see it happen?

41:39.431 --> 41:42.603
Best we can put together,
he tried to join a group of kids playing ball.

41:42.603 --> 41:45.106
They shunned him.
He walks off, alone.

41:45.106 --> 41:47.696
That's when TJ shows up.

41:51.205 --> 41:53.747
Get off me, man.
Hey, leave me alone.

41:53.747 --> 41:56.505
Can't kill a sister and just walk.

41:56.505 --> 41:57.882
Hey, come on, man.
Leave me alone, man.

41:57.882 --> 42:00.127
I ain't do nothing man.

42:00.127 --> 42:03.028
Cycle never ends, does it?

42:04.912 --> 42:07.816
Welcome to the Gaza Strip.
