00:50.133 --> 00:51.258
This is squad, we got him here.

00:51.342 --> 00:54.970
We have a positive ID. It is the Ripper.
Repeat, it is the Ripper.

01:04.313 --> 01:07.608
This is one hell of a way
to spend Christmas.

01:09.819 --> 01:12.529
- Mulcahey!
- Sir.

01:13.031 --> 01:16.158
- Secure the sidewalk. No one in or out.
- Yes, sir.

01:36.846 --> 01:39.973
Got a present for you. Pigs!

01:46.231 --> 01:51.485
Damn you! Let the children go!
Damn you, Ripper! Let the children go!

02:18.429 --> 02:22.850
Slater! Don't even think it, Slater,
you hear me?

02:22.934 --> 02:25.936
You're gonna sit and wait
for the real hostage negotiator!

02:26.521 --> 02:28.564
God damn it, Jack, I'm talking to you!

02:29.315 --> 02:33.360
The last time you pulled this jive, jitterbug,
tough gonad shit,

02:33.444 --> 02:35.362
people lost body parts!

02:36.030 --> 02:38.699
Now, you go in there and it's your badge!

02:41.703 --> 02:44.329
Jack! I know, as mayor
of this great metropolis,

02:44.414 --> 02:47.040
you and I have had our little tiffs,
but this is the Lieutenant Governor.

02:47.125 --> 02:50.127
- Slater, here's what I...
- When the governor gets here, call me.

02:50.211 --> 02:55.841
Slater's attempting to enter.
Do not let him in. Repeat, do not let him in.

02:56.259 --> 02:58.510
- Piece of cake.
- Hey.

02:59.220 --> 03:02.264
You want to be a farmer?
Here's a couple of acres.

03:04.601 --> 03:08.353
- Dekker, the next one I'll hurt.
- Slater, don't go in...

03:12.567 --> 03:16.361
Check fire. There's an officer in the building.
I say again,

03:16.446 --> 03:19.281
there's a plain-clothes officer
in the building!

03:23.870 --> 03:26.788
- Jack, what kept you?
- Dad!

03:30.293 --> 03:35.172
Andy here's been getting nervous.
I promised him you'd come.

03:36.382 --> 03:39.092
Gave him my word of honor
he could watch you die.

03:40.970 --> 03:44.806
- Lose the cannon.
- Has he hurt you, Andrew?

03:47.810 --> 03:53.106
Hurt, Jack? You say "hurt"?
What do you know about hurt, Jack?

03:53.691 --> 03:58.570
- You put me in a cage for 10 years.
- You should have gotten the death penalty.

03:58.655 --> 04:01.698
Yeah, would've, should've, could've.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.

04:01.783 --> 04:05.869
Things crawling around in your head.
Sitting on my chest when I wake up.

04:06.663 --> 04:09.081
Do you know what that's like, Jack?

04:09.707 --> 04:13.877
It was your illegal search
that rendered the bloody ax inadmissible.

04:13.962 --> 04:18.589
Remember, Jack? Now lose the gun.

04:31.020 --> 04:34.856
All right, I'm unarmed. So let the boy go.

04:34.941 --> 04:38.694
Just one gun, Jack? You got to be kidding.

05:02.093 --> 05:05.887
- Is that all, sport?
- Yep, that about does it.

05:06.472 --> 05:07.931
Then step away.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.603
Chop-chop.

05:15.189 --> 05:19.401
Oh, unless you consider this a weapon.

05:27.785 --> 05:31.747
Brilliant, Jack. Brilliant. I surrender.

05:33.458 --> 05:36.043
- It's a live grenade.
- Yeah, right, Jack. Right, right.

05:36.252 --> 05:38.545
You're going to sacrifice your own child
to get to me.

05:38.629 --> 05:41.423
I'm very flattered, Jack, but I doubt it.

05:41.883 --> 05:46.345
Andy, pick up the grenade. Go on.

05:51.476 --> 05:54.102
Show it to me. That's good. Right there.

06:00.193 --> 06:03.779
Jack, that toy can't hurt the boy,

06:05.448 --> 06:07.157
but this one can.

06:28.471 --> 06:29.679
Focus!

06:31.307 --> 06:34.643
Hey, come on! Focus!

06:34.727 --> 06:40.148
- Hey, people are trying to sleep.
- Yeah, right.

06:41.317 --> 06:46.363
The film is out of focus.
The film is out... Never mind.

06:46.656 --> 06:54.663
Nick!

07:04.507 --> 07:05.757
Nick.

07:06.801 --> 07:08.135
Nick?

07:09.804 --> 07:11.346
Nick, you okay?

07:13.474 --> 07:16.393
- What?
- The climax is on the fritz.

07:18.688 --> 07:20.730
All right. All right.

07:30.366 --> 07:32.534
I never used to do that, Danny.

07:34.537 --> 07:35.871
It's okay.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.999
I've seen this Slater six times.
I just got worried.

07:41.294 --> 07:45.630
You know, the new Jack Slater
opens this weekend at the Odyssey.

07:45.715 --> 07:47.382
Like I didn't know that.

07:47.717 --> 07:51.553
"They killed his second cousin.
Big mistake."

07:53.556 --> 07:55.724
"Jack Slater IV."

07:56.267 --> 08:01.563
Well, I'm checking the print tonight,
midnight. Just myself.

08:03.816 --> 08:06.902
I could arrange for you to gain admittance,
that is, you know,

08:06.986 --> 08:09.738
if that sort of thing appeals to you.

08:10.198 --> 08:12.449
- See it before it opens?
- Yeah.

08:12.909 --> 08:17.120
- Who do I have to kill?
- Nobody. All you have to do is get to school.

08:17.205 --> 08:19.581
You know, if you hurry,
you're only going to be four hours late.

08:45.650 --> 08:50.737
Treachery, conspiracy,
sex, sword fights, madness, ghosts.

08:51.155 --> 08:53.406
And in the end, everybody dies.

08:53.950 --> 08:56.952
Shakespeare's Hamlet
couldn't be more exciting.

08:57.286 --> 09:02.207
And though it may seem
that he is incapable of taking any action,

09:02.291 --> 09:07.963
he is, in fact, one of the first action heroes.

09:10.007 --> 09:16.304
What you are going to see
is a scene from the film by Laurence Olivier.

09:16.931 --> 09:20.600
Some of you might have seen him in
the Polaroid commercial,

09:21.185 --> 09:25.313
or as Zeus in Clash ofthe Titans.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.569
O, bosom, black as death!

09:34.824 --> 09:36.241
Help, angels!

09:37.368 --> 09:39.619
All may yet be well.

09:40.496 --> 09:44.833
Now he's praying, and now I'll do it.

10:00.016 --> 10:01.933
And so he goes to heaven.

10:02.018 --> 10:04.185
Don't talk. Just do it.

10:09.358 --> 10:11.192
Hey, Claudius.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.407
You killed my father.

10:20.536 --> 10:22.203
Big mistake.

10:24.874 --> 10:28.126
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark,

10:28.210 --> 10:32.047
and Hamlet is taking out the trash.

10:38.429 --> 10:42.515
- Stay thy hand, fair prince.
- Who said I'm fair?

10:49.899 --> 10:54.277
No one's going to tell this sweet prince,
"Good night."

10:55.363 --> 10:58.573
To be or not to be.

11:00.618 --> 11:01.951
Not to be.

11:20.638 --> 11:24.224
The whole morning? He wasn't.

11:25.851 --> 11:28.520
No, I said, "He wasn't."
He wasn't at school today.

11:28.604 --> 11:30.563
He's sick as a lamb, poor dog.

11:31.941 --> 11:36.569
Regale me with the story of your life
starting this morning, 8:30, first period,

11:36.654 --> 11:40.281
American history and make this really good.

11:40.366 --> 11:44.452
I mean something along the lines of,
"I cut so I could donate a kidney."

11:48.290 --> 11:54.421
You were at the movies again, weren't you?
And that crazy old guy is an accessory.

11:54.505 --> 11:57.757
- Nick's not crazy.
- Damn it, Danny!

12:00.010 --> 12:05.473
You know, I'm in there, lying to a principal,
me, a charter member of the PTA.

12:05.558 --> 12:08.268
And what for? So you can go to the movies?

12:09.729 --> 12:10.895
Sorry.

12:11.313 --> 12:16.234
I didn't choose any of this. I didn't choose it.
I didn't say, "Hey, what the hell,

12:16.318 --> 12:20.071
"let me see what it would be like
to be a widow before I'm 40, give that a try."

12:20.156 --> 12:23.825
- I know that.
- Give me a hug.

12:26.495 --> 12:29.914
- I won't cut again.
- Let me hear the "p" word on that.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.916
- Promise.
- All right.

12:34.170 --> 12:39.507
Oh, Jesus! I'm late. I got to get to work.
All right.

12:40.342 --> 12:44.137
Lock the top lock
the minute I close the door, okay?

12:44.221 --> 12:46.347
And do not open this door for anyone.

12:47.308 --> 12:48.808
- Bye.
- Bye.

12:50.686 --> 12:53.062
She called her mother in
and they're trying to do something about it.

12:53.147 --> 12:56.691
They had cereal bugs.
I can't wait to see the new...

12:56.776 --> 12:58.276
...continue to be a big problem...

12:58.360 --> 12:59.360
Come here often?

12:59.445 --> 13:02.197
Ron Rice for one reason.

13:03.449 --> 13:04.699
What you eating?

13:04.784 --> 13:06.075
Nothing, maggots.

13:42.279 --> 13:45.323
You alone? Okay. Move it!

13:51.664 --> 13:53.706
Do yourself to the drain.

13:58.170 --> 13:59.420
Tough guy.

14:02.967 --> 14:06.803
Do it. I'll make it easier for you.

14:10.224 --> 14:11.391
Go ahead.

14:14.979 --> 14:16.271
Do it.

14:21.902 --> 14:25.238
What is it with you? You got junk!

14:25.948 --> 14:31.995
No jewelry, no VCR.
A shit TV that will get me 20 bucks.

14:32.830 --> 14:34.706
Go fish, amigo.

14:39.128 --> 14:43.047
Remember now, your mom says
you're to go straight home.

14:44.383 --> 14:47.427
- She'll be there when the shift is over.
- Yes, sir.

14:48.762 --> 14:51.347
If we find the guy, I'll give you a call.

15:02.568 --> 15:07.030
Nick!

15:24.590 --> 15:25.882
Come on.

15:28.677 --> 15:31.179
- I about gave up on you.
- Sorry.

15:43.275 --> 15:47.528
- Well, what do you think?
- Well, I've never seen anything like it.

15:49.490 --> 15:54.494
- It's not too tight, is it?
- No, no. It's... It's the style.

15:56.205 --> 16:01.084
I always wanted to be a magician,
but my hands, they were just too tiny.

16:03.253 --> 16:06.923
My father, he was bookkeeper here
and he got me my first job.

16:07.383 --> 16:12.845
Usher. It was still a vaudeville house.
Then I worked myself up to projectionist.

16:12.930 --> 16:16.474
It's not much, but it's still show biz.

16:22.106 --> 16:25.066
So... Is the print ready to roll?

16:25.150 --> 16:28.945
Just a minute, young man.
Aren't we forgetting something?

16:31.240 --> 16:32.365
A ticket.

16:33.158 --> 16:37.745
You got to have a ticket, Danny, to see
a movie, and have I got just the one.

16:38.747 --> 16:43.251
See, when I was about your age,
Harry Houdini played this theater

16:43.335 --> 16:46.754
and my pop took me backstage to see him
after the show.

16:47.715 --> 16:51.050
And he made a gesture, Houdini did.
Like this.

16:51.677 --> 16:55.555
And all of a sudden, this was in his hand.

16:56.473 --> 17:00.768
And he said to me, he whispered,
he said, "This is a magic ticket.

17:01.603 --> 17:04.355
"It was given to me
by the best magician in India,

17:04.440 --> 17:07.275
"and it was given to him
by the best magician in Tibet.

17:07.358 --> 17:11.237
"It's a passport to another world.

17:11.946 --> 17:15.450
"It was mine, and now it's yours."

17:19.747 --> 17:21.122
And now it's yours.

17:25.210 --> 17:27.086
What does it do, Nick?

17:27.921 --> 17:30.256
I never had the courage to find out.

17:30.340 --> 17:33.259
I had the ticket for years
and I wanted to try,

17:33.343 --> 17:36.596
but I guess I was afraid it wouldn't work.

17:36.680 --> 17:39.766
See, when I was your age,
Houdini was like a god to me.

17:39.850 --> 17:41.768
But what if he was faking?

17:43.437 --> 17:44.854
And then again,

17:47.483 --> 17:49.233
what if it did work?

17:50.194 --> 17:52.403
Yeah, well, what if it did?

17:53.530 --> 17:56.991
Well, Houdini said something else to me.

17:57.618 --> 18:02.038
He said, "This ticket has a mind of its own.

18:03.082 --> 18:07.418
"It does what it wants to do."

18:09.213 --> 18:12.757
And that always made me just a little edgy.

18:14.676 --> 18:18.012
Well, I guess there's only one way
to find out, then, right?

18:24.770 --> 18:26.687
Please retain your stub, sir.

18:32.194 --> 18:34.737
Shall we see if Mr. Slater wins this time?

18:34.822 --> 18:39.200
Jack Slater can't lose!
Never has, never will.

19:22.870 --> 19:24.871
Oh, Frankie.

19:28.959 --> 19:31.752
Frank. Frankie.

19:32.629 --> 19:36.841
Frankie, why you keep on with the insults?

19:37.259 --> 19:43.264
- I would never insult you, Mr. Vivaldi.
- When you lie, that's an insult.

19:43.807 --> 19:48.019
I know you're Jack Slater's
favorite second cousin in the whole world.

19:48.103 --> 19:53.816
You all the time talk to each other.
I got to know what Slater knows,

19:54.902 --> 19:58.446
and you are going to tell me, huh?

20:00.657 --> 20:05.453
Does he know that my mob and Torelli's mob
have just signed a secret pact

20:05.787 --> 20:06.913
to control...

20:09.666 --> 20:13.085
To control all the drugs
in Southern California?

20:14.880 --> 20:17.798
We mostly talk muzzle velocities.

20:20.344 --> 20:21.427
Guns.

20:36.568 --> 20:38.945
Meet Mr. Benedict.

20:40.280 --> 20:45.076
The genuine article.
And, you'd better believe it.

20:45.827 --> 20:50.206
Sometimes, he likes to bake
while he's shooting people.

20:53.961 --> 20:59.840
What I'm saying is Mr. Benedict
can take you out as easy as cake.

21:00.550 --> 21:03.552
Pie, you Sicilian schmuck.

21:05.222 --> 21:10.851
The man is a surgeon.

21:13.397 --> 21:19.110
You want me to make him operate on you?

21:20.737 --> 21:22.280
I swear, I don't know.

21:30.163 --> 21:34.709
Dump him at his place, huh?
But take it easy.

21:37.754 --> 21:39.046
He bought it.

21:39.131 --> 21:43.718
He actually believes
me and old man Torelli are banding together.

21:45.971 --> 21:52.852
Beauty part is, nobody knows different.
Not till after the funeral.

21:53.437 --> 21:55.730
Then everybody knows.

22:00.736 --> 22:04.196
Everybody knows Tony Vivaldi

22:06.616 --> 22:08.784
is number one.

22:10.078 --> 22:13.998
You are going to pay.
Oh, are you going to pay.

22:17.711 --> 22:21.422
Are you sure this is the right address?
This don't look like no crack house to me.

22:21.506 --> 22:23.841
What do you want?
Sixty guys dancing on the lawn,

22:23.925 --> 22:27.094
throwing cocaine at each other?
Just kick the door in.

22:43.403 --> 22:44.570
What's up, guys?

22:44.654 --> 22:47.531
- Quiet. This is a drug bust.
- A drug bust?

22:48.784 --> 22:52.828
You must be joking.
My second cousin Frank lives in there.

22:53.330 --> 22:55.998
The only drugs you'll find in there
are aspirin.

22:56.708 --> 22:59.960
And if you touch that front door,
you're going to need them.

23:00.587 --> 23:04.048
Maybe there's been a mistake.
We received an anonymous tip.

23:09.930 --> 23:15.851
Frank? Frank? Frank?

23:23.360 --> 23:24.527
Frank?

23:26.988 --> 23:29.573
- Frank.
- Jack...

23:31.701 --> 23:32.868
Jack, listen to me.

23:32.953 --> 23:36.497
- Who did this?
- Listen to me. This is important.

23:38.834 --> 23:42.169
Tony Vivaldi and the Torelli mob

23:43.964 --> 23:45.673
are joining forces.

23:49.010 --> 23:50.803
I'm out of here.

23:51.388 --> 23:54.390
Frank. Frank!

24:01.690 --> 24:03.149
I'm sorry, Frank.

24:27.132 --> 24:28.507
It's a bomb!

24:37.893 --> 24:40.936
He's okay. Minor wound. Both cops dead.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.666
Two days to retirement.

26:17.242 --> 26:20.244
Nick? Hello?

26:25.166 --> 26:27.042
Nick!

26:44.185 --> 26:45.936
Who the hell are you?

26:46.021 --> 26:48.814
Don't shoot me.
I'm Danny Madigan, I'm a kid.

27:00.035 --> 27:01.452
How did you get here?

27:01.536 --> 27:04.663
I'm not quite sure where "here" is, sir,
but I don't think you want to know.

27:04.748 --> 27:07.750
Okay, close your eyes,
stay flat and don't move.

27:28.063 --> 27:30.230
You're driving with no hands.

27:30.899 --> 27:32.941
You think it's easy?
You have to practice a lot

27:33.026 --> 27:35.361
and never ever do it in heavy traffic.

27:44.788 --> 27:48.082
Iced that guy. To "cone" a phrase.

27:51.670 --> 27:55.964
Wait a minute. The bad puns, the voice,
the hard rock.

27:56.716 --> 27:59.968
This is happening.
This is really happening.

28:03.765 --> 28:07.518
This is not happening.
Repeat, this is not hap...

29:16.629 --> 29:19.298
Oh, no!

29:37.442 --> 29:40.611
I booted. Sorry.
I thought I was going to die.

29:41.196 --> 29:43.238
I'm sorry to disappoint you,

29:43.531 --> 29:47.659
but you're going to live to enjoy
all the glorious fruits life has to offer,

29:47.744 --> 29:52.915
acne, shaving, premature ejaculation
and your first divorce.

30:16.898 --> 30:19.399
Boy, does this suck weenie
or what?

30:21.820 --> 30:23.529
This is a movie set.

30:25.240 --> 30:28.909
This is a movie set.
That's how the scenery changed, right?

30:38.920 --> 30:42.756
You're going to play chicken, aren't you?
Just like Jack Slater.

30:49.097 --> 30:50.848
Fasten your seat belt, please.

30:53.017 --> 30:54.643
Your fingers?

30:55.603 --> 30:57.563
Cross as many as you can.

31:39.397 --> 31:44.610
I'm in the movie.
Holy cow, I'm in the movie!

31:50.074 --> 31:53.201
Nick, Houdini wasn't faking.

32:24.692 --> 32:26.944
Jack, did you see that?

32:35.036 --> 32:39.039
I was just in a real police station
and this is much nicer.

32:40.249 --> 32:43.043
Hey, Slater, it's your ex-wife on two.

32:45.380 --> 32:48.715
You stay. She's always calling me.

32:48.800 --> 32:52.803
Hello, sweetheart, how are you?
It's so nice to hear your voice.

32:52.887 --> 32:58.558
- Oiler, you're partnered up with Waterman.
- Give me a partner, Sarge.

33:02.730 --> 33:04.231
That is right.

33:06.234 --> 33:11.196
Yep. Of course. No, just as you say.

33:12.407 --> 33:14.741
Yep.

33:14.826 --> 33:17.828
Krause, you're teamed up with the rabbi.

33:22.834 --> 33:29.756
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:30.383 --> 33:33.969
- How do you get to Carnegie Hall?
- Practice!

33:34.262 --> 33:38.724
John Practice, you old SOB.
What are you doing away from Washington?

33:39.267 --> 33:42.394
The bureau thinks something strange
is going on between...

33:42.478 --> 33:43.520
And this is top secret...

33:43.604 --> 33:47.024
I know. The Vivaldi mob is joining forces
with the Torellis.

33:47.108 --> 33:48.734
Damn it, Jack, how do you do that?

33:48.818 --> 33:52.404
Well, I'm not parked behind a desk all day
eating those donuts.

33:52.947 --> 33:56.575
Those are government donuts, my friend.
It's not easy work. I got to call DC.

33:57.577 --> 33:58.827
Good for you.

34:00.455 --> 34:04.082
Watch it, Jack. He killed Mozart.

34:05.126 --> 34:08.837
- In a movie?
- Amadeus. It won eight Oscars.

34:08.920 --> 34:12.799
I saved his life in Nam.
I'll make sure to be on the lookout. Thanks.

34:12.967 --> 34:15.302
Now, no more movies!

34:18.389 --> 34:20.806
Slater!

34:22.768 --> 34:26.688
I got the city council chewing my eggs off
for that plane you crashed!

34:26.773 --> 34:29.399
I got the mayor scheduling parades,
up my Lincoln tunnel

34:29.484 --> 34:30.984
for that stunt you pulled on the beach!

34:31.069 --> 34:33.945
Everybody wants to know,
what it is, what it ain't and what it will be!

34:34.072 --> 34:38.074
- Do I make myself clear?
- I'm just doing my job.

34:38.159 --> 34:41.703
You've given this department
the worst reputation in the country.

34:41.788 --> 34:45.748
Now I've got the Chamber of Commerce
doing cartwheels in my cocoa factory.

34:45.833 --> 34:49.085
Radcliff, you're pulling duty
with the animated cat.

34:49.170 --> 34:51.670
Hiya, toots.

34:54.007 --> 34:58.386
- I'm getting a flea bath later. Join me?
- You touch me again, fur ball...

34:58.471 --> 35:02.516
- Wait! I can prove this is a movie.
- Who the hell are you, kid?

35:02.683 --> 35:05.268
Look out there, there's a cartoon cat.

35:06.187 --> 35:07.729
He's supposed to be back on duty.

35:07.814 --> 35:10.107
He was only suspended for a month.
Now, shut up.

35:10.191 --> 35:12.192
Listen to what I'm saying.

35:12.401 --> 35:16.947
An animated cat just walked
into the squad room. Hello.

35:17.031 --> 35:19.282
He'll do it again tomorrow.
So what's your point?

35:19.367 --> 35:21.827
- That cat is one of the best men I got!
- Yeah.

35:21.911 --> 35:24.996
Now who is this twerp?
And why is that smile on his face?

35:25.081 --> 35:27.082
I just love the way you two fight,

35:27.166 --> 35:29.334
knowing how you really feel
about each other.

35:29.418 --> 35:33.421
Pray tell, just how do I feel about
this weird-looking sack of puppy poop?

35:33.506 --> 35:37.384
You're dearest friends.
After your wife left you for the circus midget

35:37.468 --> 35:41.263
and Jack told everyone he drove her to
New England to the diphtheria clinic.

35:41.347 --> 35:43.390
When he came back, you said,

35:44.100 --> 35:46.893
"You saved me from public humiliation,
Jack.

35:46.978 --> 35:49.062
"You're my dearest friend."

35:50.273 --> 35:52.941
- And you promised me you wouldn't tell.
- I didn't.

35:53.025 --> 35:55.944
- Then how did he know?
- Jack Slater I.

35:56.028 --> 35:59.990
- What's winning got to do with this?
- No! The very first Jack Slater.

36:00.283 --> 36:01.616
You told your dad?

36:01.701 --> 36:04.995
I didn't tell anyone.
I don't even know this kid.

36:07.665 --> 36:10.250
Well, he seems to know a lot about us.

36:13.129 --> 36:14.880
No such number. No such name.

36:14.964 --> 36:17.090
The state of New York's never heard of you,
Mr. Madigan.

36:17.175 --> 36:18.675
- What's your real name?
- Danny Madigan.

36:18.759 --> 36:20.010
- Where are you really from?
- 355...

36:20.094 --> 36:21.636
- How did you get in the car?
- I...

36:24.515 --> 36:27.434
I fell off a walk over a bridge.
Slipped into your car.

36:27.852 --> 36:29.269
He saved my life.

36:31.564 --> 36:34.482
Truth at last. Now, why were they after you?

36:35.151 --> 36:37.736
My second cousin Frank
found out some crucial drug information.

36:37.820 --> 36:41.448
I wouldn't put too much faith
into what Vivaldi told him.

36:44.410 --> 36:48.622
- How do you know Frank mentioned Vivaldi?
- I know a lot about what's going on.

36:48.706 --> 36:49.706
Now if you will just listen to me...

36:49.790 --> 36:53.126
All right, son,
I've got the perfect listener for you.

36:54.253 --> 36:57.589
- Meet your new partner.
- Oh, no.

36:59.592 --> 37:00.717
Better to die.

37:01.219 --> 37:05.388
You're going to love it, Jack. I mean,
we're perfect buddy-movie material.

37:05.473 --> 37:09.392
I'll teach you to be vulnerable,
you'll teach me to be brave.

37:09.977 --> 37:12.562
Hi. I'm Jack Slater's new partner.

37:12.980 --> 37:16.775
Jack and I will be working together
for the duration of the film.

37:18.361 --> 37:19.736
You know I'm right.

37:19.820 --> 37:23.823
If this was the real world, I mean,
they wouldn't make me your partner.

37:23.908 --> 37:26.409
They'd assign me to a social worker.

37:26.577 --> 37:27.661
Here's one.

37:27.745 --> 37:31.623
Tell me how I know they tortured Frank
and then stashed him behind his front door.

37:31.707 --> 37:35.377
Because I saw it all on screen,
because this is a movie.

37:35.461 --> 37:38.755
You're very clever. And the only reason
why I'm not roaring with laughter

37:38.839 --> 37:42.092
is because someone killed
my favorite second cousin and that's a...

37:42.176 --> 37:45.595
Big mistake.
That is what you were going to say, right?

37:46.806 --> 37:50.225
- Gee, how would I know that?
- No one likes a smart-ass.

37:51.686 --> 37:53.895
Okay. Then shoot me.

37:54.480 --> 37:57.983
That's right. Take your gun,
point it at my head and pull the trigger.

37:58.359 --> 38:01.611
Come on, do it. I double dare you.

38:03.406 --> 38:06.116
You're not going to do it, are you?
And do you know why?

38:06.200 --> 38:08.576
Because people like you
don't kill kids in movies.

38:08.661 --> 38:12.038
Because, believe it or not,
Jack, you're the good guy.

38:12.790 --> 38:14.708
You really believe that we're inside a movie,
don't you?

38:14.792 --> 38:16.751
- Yes!
- All right.

38:16.836 --> 38:20.547
I'll give you 10 minutes to prove it
and then I shoot you.

38:27.221 --> 38:28.305
Slater!

38:29.348 --> 38:32.475
- Quick, where are the Schwarzenegger films?
- Foreign films are in the back.

38:32.560 --> 38:37.063
- No, action. This guy's an action star.
- Down the center on the left.

38:46.574 --> 38:49.075
No. It isn't possible.

38:49.618 --> 38:53.830
What's not possible? He's fantastic.
This is his best performance ever.

38:53.914 --> 38:59.169
- But that was you. You were in that movie.
- You were in a movie?

39:00.338 --> 39:04.257
Yes. It was called The Girl ofMy Dreams.

39:04.592 --> 39:06.092
It starred you.

39:06.177 --> 39:09.846
As a matter of fact,
we had this very romantic scene together.

39:11.265 --> 39:15.435
- What's the phone number of this store?
- 555-2310.

39:15.811 --> 39:18.021
Okay. What's your home number?

39:18.814 --> 39:22.192
That's okay. You can give it to him.
I'm a police officer.

39:22.276 --> 39:25.820
- 555-3812.
- Amazing.

39:25.905 --> 39:29.157
I'm willing to bet
that everyone has a 555 number.

39:29.241 --> 39:30.867
- So?
- So...

39:30.951 --> 39:35.622
There can only be 9,999 numbers
that start with 555.

39:35.998 --> 39:39.125
- How many people live in LA?
- Eight or nine million.

39:41.504 --> 39:43.797
That's why we have area codes.

39:44.799 --> 39:47.967
- Is this your kid?
- This? Oh, no.

39:48.052 --> 39:52.097
This is a mental patient and I'm going to
take him downtown. Come on.

39:52.306 --> 39:54.724
Okay, I got one.
What about this girl right here?

39:54.809 --> 39:58.144
She is way too attractive
to be working at a video store.

39:58.229 --> 40:01.731
I agree with you.
I think she should be working with us.

40:02.608 --> 40:04.234
Undercover, of course.

40:04.318 --> 40:08.405
Look, the point is
there are no unattractive women here.

40:08.489 --> 40:11.908
I mean, where are the ordinary,
every-day women?

40:12.827 --> 40:17.163
- They don't exist, because this is a movie.
- No. This is California.

40:17.832 --> 40:19.332
And by the way, thanks.

40:19.417 --> 40:23.378
I think it was really slick,
the way you got this girl's phone number.

40:23.546 --> 40:25.630
Okay, Mr. Non-believer.

40:26.298 --> 40:30.218
I'll take you to the house
where your cousin Frank was tortured.

40:31.137 --> 40:33.096
I've seen it, on screen.

40:34.723 --> 40:38.560
It's kind of like that one, except it's got to be
on the other side of the road

40:38.644 --> 40:40.895
'cause it's got an ocean view.

40:41.939 --> 40:44.941
Listen, there's something
you don't understand.

40:47.278 --> 40:50.196
This ticket is magic, and it really works.

40:50.531 --> 40:53.783
Any second we're going to drive
right into a theater.

40:57.204 --> 40:59.706
Maybe I need to warm it up first.

41:00.749 --> 41:04.294
Of course. My decoder ring has to warm up,
too. All the time.

41:04.378 --> 41:06.713
Okay, okay. The house looked European.

41:06.797 --> 41:10.175
Like maybe you get a postcard
from Italy or something.

41:10.342 --> 41:14.721
Like that one. In fact, just like that one.

41:15.389 --> 41:17.265
The bad guys are in there.

41:19.935 --> 41:23.396
You know something?
I think you should be wearing this.

41:23.647 --> 41:26.608
- I don't think I've earned it yet.
- You don't understand.

41:26.692 --> 41:28.651
You just solved the entire case.

41:28.736 --> 41:31.696
You just revolutionized
the entire history of police training.

41:31.780 --> 41:35.033
I mean, all these years at the academy,
studying human character,

41:35.117 --> 41:37.410
psyche of the terrorist, fingerprint analysis.

41:37.495 --> 41:39.746
All the courses that I've taken
in surveillance,

41:39.830 --> 41:42.665
hostage negotiation
and criminal psychology...

41:42.750 --> 41:45.627
When all I had to do is just drive around
the neighborhood

41:45.711 --> 41:47.295
and point my finger at the house and say,

41:47.379 --> 41:49.589
"The bad guys are in there."

41:50.966 --> 41:53.635
- You think you're funny, don't you?
- I know I am.

41:53.719 --> 41:56.346
I'm the famous comedian,
Arnold Braunschweiger.

41:56.430 --> 41:58.681
- Schwarzenegger.
- Gesundheit.

42:14.865 --> 42:16.032
May I help you?

42:16.116 --> 42:19.327
Yes. Could I speak to the drug dealer
of the house please?

42:19.411 --> 42:20.870
I beg your pardon?

42:20.955 --> 42:24.457
It's a beautiful day
and we're out killing drug dealers.

42:24.708 --> 42:26.834
Are there any in the house?

42:31.298 --> 42:32.799
Be ready for anything.

42:36.470 --> 42:39.931
- Wait. Where are you going?
- I'll be back.

42:40.349 --> 42:43.059
You didn't know I was going to say that,
did you?

42:43.143 --> 42:46.187
- That's what you always say.
- I do?

42:47.731 --> 42:49.732
Everybody keeps waiting
for you to work it in.

42:49.817 --> 42:52.360
It's kind of like your calling card.

42:54.863 --> 42:57.407
I understand you're interested
in drug dealers.

42:57.491 --> 42:58.616
Yes.

42:58.701 --> 43:01.953
Jack, that's him,
the henchman with the glass eye.

43:02.663 --> 43:05.206
Sir, are you a henchman?

43:06.000 --> 43:10.378
No. I only go as far as lackey.
Will there be anything else?

43:10.462 --> 43:12.672
Yeah. Take off your sunglasses.

43:13.007 --> 43:16.009
- Who's asking?
- The tin man.

43:17.970 --> 43:22.348
- Well, tin man, suppose you hit the bricks.
- No. They're the wrong color.

43:22.433 --> 43:27.312
Are they? Oh, dear. By all means, let's
change them. Would arterial red suit you?

43:33.902 --> 43:37.030
Make no mistake.
They are exceptionally well-trained.

43:41.619 --> 43:44.704
I snap my fingers again,
and some time tomorrow

43:44.788 --> 43:47.540
you emerge from several canine recta.

43:48.542 --> 43:51.544
Or you and Toto can go back to
the land of Oz.

43:51.629 --> 43:53.463
- Questions?
- Yeah.

43:55.090 --> 43:56.424
Two of them.

43:57.301 --> 44:00.553
Why am I wasting time
on a dime store putz like you

44:01.055 --> 44:03.890
when I could be doing something
much more dangerous?

44:04.099 --> 44:06.476
Like rearranging my sock drawers.

44:06.727 --> 44:10.563
And two, how exactly are you going to
snap your fingers

44:10.648 --> 44:13.024
after I rip off both of your thumbs?

44:20.324 --> 44:21.908
Have a nice day.

44:28.582 --> 44:32.251
He had one with a bull's-eye
when he was with your second cousin.

44:32.336 --> 44:35.588
He hates his boss.
He calls him a Sicilian schmuck.

44:50.938 --> 44:54.524
How did Slater find out? Will you tell me?

44:55.651 --> 45:00.988
I want him to join me, but he's nuts.
He keeps going after the bad guys.

45:01.073 --> 45:04.117
Where is it written I'm a bad guy?

45:04.868 --> 45:07.078
Find out who talked and have him killed.

45:07.162 --> 45:09.247
Then, Slater.

45:11.291 --> 45:13.543
Hey. Hey!

45:13.627 --> 45:15.169
What's with you?

45:15.671 --> 45:18.089
We should change
the funeral arrangements.

45:18.173 --> 45:22.218
Are you crazy?
When I say bloodbath, there is

45:22.761 --> 45:24.554
- a bloodbath.
- A bloodbath.

45:26.390 --> 45:30.518
I'm going to find out more
about Slater's short friend.

45:31.645 --> 45:33.229
Come on, Jack.

45:33.313 --> 45:36.065
That guy has got to be guilty of something.

45:36.150 --> 45:39.068
Yeah. He's guilty of acting like an asshole.

45:39.445 --> 45:42.196
If I arrest him,
I have to arrest half of Congress.

45:42.281 --> 45:43.823
Why did we park back there?

45:43.907 --> 45:45.491
In case my ex-wife is around.

45:45.576 --> 45:49.245
Don't worry, she's not.
Her name wasn't in the credits.

45:49.329 --> 45:52.999
Kid, who does the doctor treat?

45:53.333 --> 45:54.500
Patients.

45:54.585 --> 45:57.086
Look at the elbow of my jacket.
What is it doing?

45:57.171 --> 45:59.505
- Wearing thin?
- Bingo.

46:01.592 --> 46:03.718
Geez, that was a stretch.

46:05.012 --> 46:08.181
Wow! Is this
what you drive on the weekends?

46:08.599 --> 46:10.600
No, this is my little girl's car.

46:10.684 --> 46:12.560
Come on. Knock on the door.

46:13.437 --> 46:15.730
I told you, your ex-wife's not home.

46:16.273 --> 46:18.524
Her name wasn't in the credits.

46:24.114 --> 46:25.281
Meredith?

46:25.365 --> 46:27.158
I hope you mean Whitney.

46:27.701 --> 46:29.118
Sorry. Whitney.

46:29.203 --> 46:31.412
You're not Skeezy, are you?

46:34.458 --> 46:36.959
Daddy! Oh, my God.

46:38.212 --> 46:41.005
- Daddy!
- You've gained some weight.

46:41.590 --> 46:46.719
Hi. I'm Danny Madigan
and I realize I haven't had that long of a life,

46:47.429 --> 46:51.808
but I just want you to know that
from now on, it's all going to be downhill.

46:51.892 --> 46:54.811
- Hello, sweetheart, you look wonderful.
- Thank you.

46:54.895 --> 46:58.648
So, who's your friend? He's cute.

46:58.732 --> 47:02.485
No, he's not cute, he's hopelessly insane.

47:02.569 --> 47:05.404
Very soon he's gonna tell you
he loved you in Gone with the Wind.

47:05.489 --> 47:08.825
- This is her first movie.
- You see?

47:08.909 --> 47:12.203
- Now who is Skeezy?
- It's just a sorority thing, Dad. What they do

47:12.287 --> 47:15.832
is they assign you a freshman, and
when he comes to the door, you kiss him.

47:15.916 --> 47:19.335
- Do you have to kiss him?
- Dad, would you come on?

47:19.419 --> 47:23.005
Okay, would you grab the phone
and if it's for me, I'll be out of the shower

47:23.090 --> 47:25.424
in less than one hour for sure.

47:26.927 --> 47:29.095
What a cutie.

47:30.681 --> 47:35.351
It's old evidence. Counterfeit case.
Looks real, doesn't it?

47:35.435 --> 47:37.854
Turns funny colors when you burn it.

47:37.938 --> 47:40.231
Try using it for alimony.

47:48.991 --> 47:50.575
What's wrong?

47:56.290 --> 47:59.041
You don't happen to have a cigar, do you?

48:04.506 --> 48:06.674
"I'll be back." I know, I know.

48:26.862 --> 48:29.572
Dad! Dad!

49:03.774 --> 49:06.275
He would have been your age.

49:08.362 --> 49:09.695
I know.

49:11.490 --> 49:15.576
The Ripper killed him three years ago.
Pulled him down off the roof.

49:16.995 --> 49:18.871
Your dad saw everything.

49:18.956 --> 49:20.957
How did you know all that?

49:24.044 --> 49:28.130
Your pop gets in the papers a lot.
I'm interested in crime stories.

49:29.091 --> 49:32.551
- That's Skeezy.
- I'll get rid of him.

49:41.228 --> 49:42.603
Hello, Toto.

49:47.985 --> 49:51.487
There, there, and there.

49:51.571 --> 49:55.741
No! Let go of me! Let go of me!

49:58.161 --> 50:01.038
- Stop it!
- Evening. Uncle Jack around?

50:01.123 --> 50:03.916
Mr. Slater's off tracking a lead somewhere.

50:06.336 --> 50:08.963
Joey, would you teach her
the virtue of silence?

50:09.047 --> 50:11.590
- Right.
- Benedict.

50:11.675 --> 50:15.803
- If you harm a hair on her head...
- Stop!

50:25.981 --> 50:30.443
Go away! Stop it! No!

50:32.654 --> 50:34.405
You were saying?

50:38.285 --> 50:44.832
Now, I believe
it was Sherlock Holmes who said

50:45.834 --> 50:48.753
that if you eliminate
all the logical solutions to a problem,

50:48.837 --> 50:52.506
the illogical, however impossible,
is invariably true.

50:53.508 --> 50:57.428
You see, I know
that your name is Daniel Madigan.

50:57.512 --> 51:00.556
What I don't understand
is how you know mine.

51:03.560 --> 51:07.646
Slater showed me some mug shots.
We made your face easy.

51:09.691 --> 51:12.401
Daniel Madigan from New York City.

51:12.486 --> 51:16.947
Awfully long way away from home,
aren't you? When did you get here?

51:17.032 --> 51:18.074
Just.

51:18.158 --> 51:20.910
And how do you know
what I said on Vivaldi's terrace?

51:22.120 --> 51:24.121
I heard a recording.

51:24.206 --> 51:26.665
Microphones in the statues, are there?

51:27.209 --> 51:29.877
You wouldn't believe how many.

51:29.961 --> 51:32.963
And the eye I was wearing?

51:34.299 --> 51:36.801
I saw it. I saw it in a movie.

51:37.761 --> 51:39.553
There are micro cameras in the statues.

51:39.638 --> 51:45.476
I should tell you that I have killed people
smarter and younger than you.

51:53.610 --> 51:57.738
Look, whatever this is,
it's between you and Slater.

51:57.823 --> 52:02.243
There's some money in the desk.
Take it and leave me and Meredith...

52:02.327 --> 52:03.911
Whitney alone.

52:08.792 --> 52:10.918
Holy shit, boss.

52:11.002 --> 52:12.753
It looks like 2K in here.

52:12.838 --> 52:15.131
Just a minute.

52:15.215 --> 52:16.757
Give it to me.

52:22.848 --> 52:25.057
These bills are marked, aren't they?

52:25.767 --> 52:30.563
You were trying to sucker me
with marked bills, weren't you?

52:32.399 --> 52:33.691
Burn it.

52:35.152 --> 52:37.736
- Burn it?
- Yes, burn it.

52:38.613 --> 52:42.616
Don't play games with grownups, little boy.
You'll get hurt.

53:02.929 --> 53:05.181
Stop it! Stop it! Oh, God.

53:05.265 --> 53:06.932
Big mistake.

53:24.951 --> 53:26.869
It's great, isn't it?

53:26.953 --> 53:30.414
Now, we'll hurt you just a little bit,
but you'll...

53:30.498 --> 53:31.874
Freeze!

53:31.958 --> 53:35.836
Lose the guns or I redecorate
in brain-matter gray, got it?

53:35.921 --> 53:37.463
Yes!

53:39.382 --> 53:42.009
You kill me and I'll kill him.

53:48.934 --> 53:51.143
Leave it. Get the door.

54:01.029 --> 54:02.112
Boss?

54:04.366 --> 54:05.574
Hi.

54:42.237 --> 54:44.071
Don't give up your day job.

55:17.188 --> 55:19.023
Jack!

55:24.446 --> 55:26.488
Don't leave home without it.

55:27.282 --> 55:28.282
Go!

55:35.915 --> 55:37.458
Where are you going?

55:39.294 --> 55:41.295
Got to catch the red-eye.

55:51.222 --> 55:53.932
I don't believe this. I'm in the movie, and...

55:56.061 --> 55:58.520
I'm in the movie,
and I'm missing the best action!

56:01.983 --> 56:04.568
Punch it. Let's get the hell out of here.

56:20.919 --> 56:22.711
Go back up to the top!

56:29.677 --> 56:32.137
Next time, we get thicker armor.

56:33.431 --> 56:34.723
Like a tank.

56:54.994 --> 56:56.495
Chicken, it is.

57:06.756 --> 57:11.552
This is gonna work. It's a movie.
I'm a good guy. This has got to work!

57:15.890 --> 57:17.724
I'm a comedy sidekick.

57:18.226 --> 57:21.520
Oh, shit! I'm a comedy sidekick!

57:21.604 --> 57:25.023
It's not gonna work!

57:51.259 --> 57:54.761
Well, I think I scared him pretty good.

57:54.846 --> 57:57.055
You did great. Come on.

57:58.725 --> 58:02.186
- Benedict's got the ticket.
- That's too bad.

58:02.270 --> 58:04.480
I wanted it for my collection.

58:26.753 --> 58:29.671
I told you, Blanche isn't here.
She won't be back for two hours.

58:29.756 --> 58:32.257
I know. I'm gonna wait for her.

58:33.760 --> 58:37.721
It is a shame. It's so romantic.

58:38.473 --> 58:42.893
Well, I'll never get any work done
if I stay here and think about that.

58:42.977 --> 58:45.103
I'll run with Jane to the store.

58:46.981 --> 58:50.150
What a shame. Two tickets to Hawaii.

58:50.235 --> 58:55.197
Oh, I've gotta get her a husband.
Maybe Blanche can help out.

59:00.954 --> 59:04.206
We'll be right back
after this commercial announcement.

59:04.290 --> 59:06.250
You know, if you're looking
for a new or used car, see me first.

59:06.334 --> 59:08.544
Give me first crack at the deal.
I'll beat anybody else's deal.

59:08.628 --> 59:11.046
I'd gargle anti-freeze
to beat anybody else's deal.

59:11.130 --> 59:12.548
So see me first, give me first shot.

59:12.632 --> 59:15.717
Now here's a nice car.
Seventy-three, this is a Landau,

59:15.802 --> 59:18.554
top power steering, power brakes,
air conditioning. $999.

59:18.638 --> 59:23.559
If you're looking for trucks, we got trucks.
We got all kinds of trucks. '79 pickup, $2,999.

59:23.643 --> 59:27.854
Here's another one. This is a Long Bed.
This is $3,999. Can't beat that.

59:28.022 --> 59:29.398
Give me first shot...

59:43.663 --> 59:45.998
You're traveling
through another dimension.

59:46.165 --> 59:49.876
My name is Skeezy. S-K-E-E-Z-Y, sir.

59:50.461 --> 59:53.005
S-K-E...No I-E. Thank you.

01:00:38.176 --> 01:00:39.593
Say this.

01:00:43.973 --> 01:00:46.141
Hey, grow up.

01:00:46.809 --> 01:00:48.393
Just say this one word.

01:00:49.771 --> 01:00:52.481
Is this another one of your movie proofs?

01:00:52.565 --> 01:00:54.107
Maybe.

01:00:55.151 --> 01:00:57.736
Kid, I don't want to say it.

01:00:58.404 --> 01:00:59.780
Say what?

01:01:00.657 --> 01:01:03.742
You can't. You can't possibly say it

01:01:03.826 --> 01:01:07.579
because this movie is PG-13. Admit it.

01:01:07.664 --> 01:01:09.122
Officer Slater,

01:01:09.207 --> 01:01:12.209
the guy with the missing eye,
I saw his license plate.

01:01:12.293 --> 01:01:14.044
Well, good for you.

01:01:17.423 --> 01:01:20.175
- You mean the guy with the glass eye?
- No.

01:01:20.259 --> 01:01:23.762
When he was running for the car,
it was missing.

01:01:24.764 --> 01:01:26.765
It's got words.

01:01:29.310 --> 01:01:31.687
"Vengeance is..."

01:01:33.773 --> 01:01:34.815
Don't touch!

01:01:40.154 --> 01:01:41.154
You flipped up on all of it!

01:01:41.239 --> 01:01:42.489
God damn it, that's all I can take from you!

01:01:42.573 --> 01:01:44.241
I got the California Raisin Counsel doing

01:01:44.325 --> 01:01:45.784
an all-male version
of The Diary of Anne Frank,

01:01:45.868 --> 01:01:47.369
doing an all-male version
in my fuzzy slipper!

01:01:47.453 --> 01:01:49.037
Tiny Tim is tiptoeing through the tulips!

01:01:49.122 --> 01:01:51.164
- Did you catch that?
- You ball-peen jack-a-menace.

01:01:51.249 --> 01:01:54.209
I slurped about all the cock-sucking toast
I can take from you!

01:01:54.293 --> 01:01:55.877
You know you...

01:01:59.132 --> 01:02:01.133
I think some of it's English.

01:02:01.426 --> 01:02:03.844
Well, see if this is clear enough!

01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:05.303
Give me your badge!

01:02:05.388 --> 01:02:07.723
And this time, you won't get it back.

01:02:17.108 --> 01:02:20.152
Wohlschlager, you're partnered up
with the black-and-white digitalization

01:02:20.236 --> 01:02:22.696
of Humphrey Bogart.

01:02:34.292 --> 01:02:36.835
What, are you making some changes?

01:02:37.628 --> 01:02:40.672
Come on, why don't you come
and work the funeral with me, anyway?

01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:44.551
I mean, I don't know, I wouldn't miss
this one. I hear Torelli spent a bundle.

01:02:44.635 --> 01:02:48.263
He's got a damn helicopter
circling the building.

01:02:48.347 --> 01:02:52.100
A rooftop funeral service in Long Beach.
How's that for taste?

01:02:52.185 --> 01:02:53.477
Who died?

01:02:53.978 --> 01:02:55.896
Leo the Fart was shot yesterday.

01:02:56.814 --> 01:02:59.191
Somebody was trying for Torelli and missed.

01:02:59.275 --> 01:03:01.401
Leo was tough.

01:03:01.486 --> 01:03:04.279
He could do everything
but sneak up on you.

01:03:04.781 --> 01:03:08.742
Look, look, if you change your mind,
I'll be in front of the hotel.

01:03:27.762 --> 01:03:31.306
- Where are we, anyway?
- Home.

01:03:46.239 --> 01:03:48.698
Geez!
How did you know there was a guy in there?

01:03:48.783 --> 01:03:50.992
There's always a guy in there.

01:03:51.077 --> 01:03:53.453
Costs me a fortune in closet doors.

01:03:53.538 --> 01:03:57.499
Right. Like in Slater, Part Il:
The Sagittarius Strangler.

01:03:57.583 --> 01:04:01.294
Yeah, in a few seconds,
you're gonna meet the Madigan strangler.

01:04:01.379 --> 01:04:02.879
I just got fired.

01:04:02.964 --> 01:04:06.091
What you find so entertaining
happens to be my life.

01:04:06.175 --> 01:04:08.426
Now I'm not even a cop anymore.

01:04:09.428 --> 01:04:11.012
You'll get your badge back.

01:04:11.097 --> 01:04:15.141
He was just pulling rank because you
destroyed more of the city than usual.

01:04:15.226 --> 01:04:18.353
Jack, you're not just my hero,
you're everybody's hero.

01:04:18.437 --> 01:04:21.773
And it will all be okay again. Trust me.

01:04:22.483 --> 01:04:24.985
No, Danny. It's getting harder.

01:04:26.279 --> 01:04:29.698
I never started out
to be anything but a decent cop,

01:04:29.782 --> 01:04:33.034
but I kept getting involved
in these crazy adventures.

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:38.331
But the craziest part is, I kept surviving.

01:04:38.416 --> 01:04:41.626
Jack, these are the sequels.
They gotta get harder.

01:04:44.672 --> 01:04:46.339
But look on the good side.

01:04:46.424 --> 01:04:48.842
I mean, you've got a great daughter.

01:04:48.926 --> 01:04:50.802
And your ex-wife wouldn't keep calling if

01:04:50.887 --> 01:04:52.679
somewhere deep down
she didn't want you back.

01:04:52.763 --> 01:04:55.181
Danny, do you think I would marry
someone so stupid

01:04:55.266 --> 01:04:58.226
that doesn't know
the real voice from a taped one?

01:04:58.311 --> 01:05:01.396
I pay a cashier at the drugstore
to call me every so often at the station

01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:04.149
so the guys think I have a private life.

01:05:05.651 --> 01:05:08.194
My ex-wife, she's happily remarried.

01:05:08.529 --> 01:05:10.155
She never calls.

01:05:11.198 --> 01:05:12.616
And Whitney.

01:05:13.701 --> 01:05:16.411
Why can she not be like
every other teenager?

01:05:16.495 --> 01:05:20.040
On prom night, she stays home
and field strips an AK-47.

01:05:21.417 --> 01:05:24.336
She's going to die a young maid. I know it.

01:05:26.172 --> 01:05:28.381
I'm going to buy it soon, too.

01:05:28.466 --> 01:05:31.509
No way.
You can't die till the grosses go down.

01:05:34.555 --> 01:05:36.222
That guy Vivaldi,

01:05:36.307 --> 01:05:38.725
I heard him say something
was going to happen at a funeral.

01:05:38.851 --> 01:05:42.145
Now this Leo the Fart is going to have one.
Maybe we should look into that.

01:05:42.313 --> 01:05:44.189
Yeah, yeah. Whatever you say.

01:05:44.273 --> 01:05:48.151
Jack, it's a funeral for a guy named Fart.
Hello?

01:05:49.070 --> 01:05:50.236
Funeral?

01:05:50.321 --> 01:05:54.115
Check this out.
Someone tried to kill old man Torelli, right?

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:56.826
Missed and shot Leo the Fart by mistake.

01:05:56.911 --> 01:05:58.453
- Right.
- Wrong.

01:05:58.704 --> 01:06:02.207
Who took the shot? Was it Benedict?
Most likely.

01:06:02.833 --> 01:06:06.711
Would he miss? No way.
Unless he wanted to miss.

01:06:07.046 --> 01:06:10.423
You're saying he meant to miss?
Why?

01:06:10.716 --> 01:06:14.386
Because, amigo,
Leo the Fart was very, very fat.

01:06:15.179 --> 01:06:17.263
- Get it?
- No, I don't.

01:06:17.556 --> 01:06:20.433
They broke in last night.
They cut Leo open like a turkey,

01:06:20.518 --> 01:06:23.853
stuffed him with TNT,
he goes off at the funeral

01:06:23.938 --> 01:06:26.982
and takes out the entire Torelli mob,
all at once.

01:06:27.149 --> 01:06:30.568
Vivaldi owns the town.
That's what all this has been about.

01:06:30.653 --> 01:06:33.029
Vivaldi's going to blow up that funeral.

01:06:33.114 --> 01:06:35.699
No. No. It wouldn't just be a bomb.

01:06:35.783 --> 01:06:38.827
I mean, we've already had
a dozen explosions in this movie.

01:06:38.911 --> 01:06:41.246
Danny, don't start that again.

01:06:42.581 --> 01:06:44.833
- Nerve gas!
- What are you talking about?

01:06:44.917 --> 01:06:49.212
Three canisters of nerve gas were stolen
from military trucks the night before last.

01:06:49.296 --> 01:06:53.258
They could have stuffed those inside him.
And you know what that means, don't you?

01:06:54.927 --> 01:06:58.096
Leo the Fart is going to pass gas
one more time.

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:16.364
Mr. Torelli,
I hope it's all right with you I am here.

01:07:16.449 --> 01:07:19.826
- I don't want to be no fourth wheel.
- Nonsense, Antonio...

01:07:21.370 --> 01:07:22.787
Fifth wheel.

01:07:22.955 --> 01:07:25.123
That's nice. Thank you, thank you.

01:07:25.207 --> 01:07:27.375
Did you hear that, Benedict?

01:07:27.501 --> 01:07:28.752
Family.

01:07:29.378 --> 01:07:31.463
Go pay your respects, huh?

01:08:06.207 --> 01:08:09.292
- Stay in the car.
- No way. I'm coming with you.

01:08:09.376 --> 01:08:11.711
Kid, let's say this is a movie.

01:08:11.796 --> 01:08:15.006
How many times have you heard someone
say, "Stay in the car" and the guy doesn't?

01:08:15.091 --> 01:08:16.633
What happens?

01:08:17.009 --> 01:08:19.385
- He saves the day.
- Or gets killed.

01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:21.845
Good point. I'll stay in the car.

01:08:22.098 --> 01:08:26.184
Wait a minute! What if staying in the car
is what gets me killed?

01:08:26.685 --> 01:08:29.395
There's a gun in the glove compartment.

01:08:35.069 --> 01:08:37.237
- Practice!
- Makes perfect.

01:08:39.490 --> 01:08:42.408
- You decided to join me, huh?
- The Fart is a bomb.

01:08:42.493 --> 01:08:44.828
They're going to take out the whole
Torelli mob. We've got to stop it.

01:08:44.912 --> 01:08:47.788
That explains the break-in at the mortuary.
Geez, that's brilliant.

01:08:47.872 --> 01:08:50.917
Come on.
We'll use the service entrance in back.

01:08:55.673 --> 01:08:59.216
- Who are you working for, John?
- What do you mean?

01:08:59.385 --> 01:09:02.679
We both know
there's no side entrance to this hotel.

01:09:06.850 --> 01:09:10.520
Sorry, Jack.
I didn't want it to go down this way.

01:09:14.233 --> 01:09:16.568
Danny told me not to trust you.

01:09:16.986 --> 01:09:19.154
He said you killed Moe Zart.

01:09:19.738 --> 01:09:22.157
- Moe, who?
- Zart.

01:09:24.326 --> 01:09:26.953
I kill a lot of people.
I can't remember half of them.

01:09:27.037 --> 01:09:29.413
How do you get to Carnegie Hall?

01:09:31.125 --> 01:09:33.792
In a body bag, if you don't drop that.

01:09:35.004 --> 01:09:36.837
That's doubtful, kid.

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:40.133
Real doubtful.

01:09:43.595 --> 01:09:46.096
Thanks for the fingerprints, kid.

01:09:46.265 --> 01:09:48.600
You're about to murder Jack Slater.

01:09:48.975 --> 01:09:51.435
Here. Chain yourself to that pipe.

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:57.025
See, Jack, these drug guys, they got
more money than the U.S. Government.

01:09:57.109 --> 01:10:00.570
So you cut a deal
with a Sicilian scumbag like Vivaldi.

01:10:00.821 --> 01:10:02.405
Right you are.

01:10:02.865 --> 01:10:06.659
You see, Vivaldi made up with Torelli,
but it was a phony.

01:10:06.744 --> 01:10:08.453
He's going to destroy him.

01:10:08.537 --> 01:10:12.999
So, in exchange for letting him alone,
he gives me a profit percentage.

01:10:13.626 --> 01:10:15.376
I'll be rich, Jack.

01:10:15.753 --> 01:10:18.046
- You'll be dead, but...
- Freeze!

01:10:18.964 --> 01:10:20.632
Toss me the cuffs.

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:25.386
Man, are you an idiot!
You made the classic movie mistake.

01:10:25.471 --> 01:10:29.557
Don't explain so much.
You had to get in those last few words.

01:10:29.683 --> 01:10:32.936
I mean, if you had just fired,
you would have won.

01:10:33.145 --> 01:10:36.147
But, no, you're the typical villain. Dumb.

01:10:37.524 --> 01:10:39.984
You ain't no genius yourself, kid.

01:10:41.237 --> 01:10:44.489
- The Fart goes off in seven minutes.
- Get my car.

01:10:46.992 --> 01:10:48.284
Move it.

01:10:50.996 --> 01:10:54.999
Well, I'd love to stay and watch the fun,

01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:59.837
but I have to go and establish my alibi.

01:11:05.177 --> 01:11:07.220
So, is this the day
you were talking about saving?

01:11:07.304 --> 01:11:11.015
- I don't see you doing anything.
- I wouldn't want to steal your thunder.

01:11:12.101 --> 01:11:13.393
No, no, no.

01:11:13.477 --> 01:11:17.146
You stay here and make sure
everything goes on as planned.

01:11:17.898 --> 01:11:23.027
You had Slater in front of the eight ball
before, but you always screwed it up.

01:11:24.238 --> 01:11:26.030
All right. Let's go.

01:11:28.867 --> 01:11:31.953
It's behind the eight ball, you moron.

01:11:33.038 --> 01:11:36.916
Somebody once told me I talk too much.
No more words.

01:11:41.213 --> 01:11:43.673
Whiskers! Where the hell have you been?

01:11:43.757 --> 01:11:46.009
Sorry, Jack. Fur ball problem.

01:11:47.094 --> 01:11:51.472
Seal off the area. There's a possible
chemical explosion in five minutes.

01:11:51.557 --> 01:11:56.394
- Thanks, Whiskers. I owe you one.
- Forget it. You saved my fur plenty of times.

01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:02.108
You see the hook of that crane?

01:12:02.192 --> 01:12:05.570
I want it on top of the roof
in two minutes. Go.

01:12:05.779 --> 01:12:08.281
Wait. How do I get them to do that?

01:12:34.308 --> 01:12:37.643
You got to help me move that crane!
You got to help me!

01:12:37.728 --> 01:12:40.521
- I got to get that crane to the roof.
- Shit.

01:12:40.606 --> 01:12:43.608
Hey, wait a minute!
You got to work this thing!

01:12:53.410 --> 01:12:55.703
I don't even know how to drive.

01:13:27.486 --> 01:13:30.988
- Pardon me. Excuse me.
- Hey!

01:13:36.995 --> 01:13:38.329
Pardon me.

01:13:41.667 --> 01:13:44.544
He was a good man. A flatulent man.

01:13:49.007 --> 01:13:50.633
Do you hear this?

01:13:51.176 --> 01:13:53.636
Help me. Get me out of here.

01:13:54.304 --> 01:13:57.140
My God! This man's not dead!

01:14:05.941 --> 01:14:09.861
Get out of the way! This man needs a doctor!
Out of my way.

01:14:09.945 --> 01:14:12.697
- This man needs a doctor!
- I'm a doctor.

01:14:13.073 --> 01:14:14.949
- You're a doctor?
- Yes.

01:14:15.534 --> 01:14:17.076
Check his chin.

01:14:19.037 --> 01:14:21.747
The doctor has fainted.
Can somebody help this man here?

01:14:21.832 --> 01:14:24.375
I'll take the corpse... I mean, the patient.

01:14:24.877 --> 01:14:26.586
Look, an elephant.

01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:36.596
Hold it! Don't shoot! He'll drop Leo!

01:15:00.329 --> 01:15:01.787
Don't shoot!

01:16:11.316 --> 01:16:12.650
Oh, shit!

01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:19.323
Watch out!

01:17:00.198 --> 01:17:04.827
It's a no-fly zone, fella.
Shit!

01:17:49.915 --> 01:17:55.044
Danny! He's ticking!
Move the crane as fast as you can!

01:18:18.151 --> 01:18:22.029
Danny! Stop the crane now! Stop it!

01:18:23.323 --> 01:18:26.867
Drop! Go! Go! Go! Go! Damn you! Go!

01:18:26.952 --> 01:18:30.413
Gas bag, drop! Damn you! Drop!

01:18:31.456 --> 01:18:34.625
Drop! Gas bag, drop!

01:18:55.605 --> 01:18:58.566
Get out of here! Everybody out!

01:19:38.690 --> 01:19:40.399
Silent, but deadly.

01:19:44.696 --> 01:19:46.489
Bring the car around.

01:19:46.698 --> 01:19:49.241
Can't. The helicopter landed on it.

01:19:50.619 --> 01:19:52.661
I hate when that happens.

01:19:52.829 --> 01:19:55.790
You know, tar actually
sticks to some people.

01:20:06.301 --> 01:20:10.596
Hey, Dad! I heard you were here.
I thought you could use some clothes.

01:20:10.764 --> 01:20:13.224
- Thanks, honey.
- Wait a minute.

01:20:14.017 --> 01:20:16.268
No one finds this a little convenient?

01:20:16.353 --> 01:20:19.772
Hey, kid, you always said
this is a movie, didn't you?

01:20:24.569 --> 01:20:26.070
How did it go?

01:20:29.449 --> 01:20:31.242
Hey! How did it go?

01:20:34.955 --> 01:20:39.333
Come on. I'm dying out here.
How was it? I want to know how it went.

01:20:46.842 --> 01:20:50.177
Come on, move your butt.
How did it went?

01:20:50.345 --> 01:20:51.637
Splendid.

01:20:52.305 --> 01:20:53.430
What?

01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:58.894
- It went splendidly!
- Wait, wait a minute. I can't hear you.

01:20:58.979 --> 01:21:02.606
I don't want to miss a thing.
Come here. Come here.

01:21:04.276 --> 01:21:06.360
- Hey, Benedict, get your stuff.
- Yes.

01:21:06.444 --> 01:21:09.697
- Was it beautiful?
- Perfect in every detail.

01:21:10.365 --> 01:21:13.367
And the gas tanks. Poof! Were they okay?

01:21:13.785 --> 01:21:15.327
Like clockwork.

01:21:15.912 --> 01:21:17.371
You should have been there.

01:21:17.455 --> 01:21:22.167
Men, women and children dropping
left and right, writhing and screaming.

01:21:22.252 --> 01:21:25.671
Wait a minute. Wait, wait. Wait a minute.
I want to enjoy it all.

01:21:26.089 --> 01:21:27.673
Go on, go on. Tell me, tell me.

01:21:27.757 --> 01:21:32.553
They were writhing and screaming and
leaping to their doom to escape the pain.

01:21:33.138 --> 01:21:36.140
- Really? Really?
- No, not really. I'm lying.

01:21:36.224 --> 01:21:38.142
It was a complete and utter balls-up

01:21:38.226 --> 01:21:41.520
and I've had a terrible day,
thanks largely to you.

01:21:42.981 --> 01:21:47.192
What is this, Benedict?
First, you're my friend. Now you turn a

01:21:48.653 --> 01:21:50.446
- 360 on me.
- God.

01:21:50.530 --> 01:21:54.366
One-eighty,
you stupid, spaghetti-slurping cretin.

01:21:54.451 --> 01:21:57.161
One-eighty! If I did a 360,

01:21:57.245 --> 01:22:00.831
I'd go completely around
and end up back where I started!

01:22:02.709 --> 01:22:04.710
- What?
- Trust me.

01:22:08.173 --> 01:22:11.926
If that little turd, Daniel Madigan,
can move through parallel worlds,

01:22:12.010 --> 01:22:15.429
I can move through
parallel worlds, in and out.

01:22:15.764 --> 01:22:20.434
In, steal whatever I want, and out again.
Impossible to catch.

01:22:23.104 --> 01:22:25.064
If God was a villain,

01:22:27.192 --> 01:22:28.525
he'd be me.

01:22:30.445 --> 01:22:33.364
- You want me vacuum now?
- No, thank you.

01:22:34.366 --> 01:22:37.451
But the pool could benefit
from some attention.

01:22:37.619 --> 01:22:38.994
Very good.

01:22:53.969 --> 01:22:55.386
Don't move.

01:22:58.848 --> 01:23:02.518
- All right, Slater, I'll go quietly.
- The hell you will.

01:23:10.610 --> 01:23:14.196
That was for blowing up
my second cousin, Frank's house.

01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:18.283
And this is for blowing up
my ex-wife's house.

01:23:20.704 --> 01:23:24.248
But this...
This is for my daughter's black eye!

01:23:28.753 --> 01:23:31.588
Usually, when I do that, it leaves a hole.

01:23:32.924 --> 01:23:37.094
The ticket. Jack, he's got the ticket!

01:23:38.430 --> 01:23:41.140
It's the key to everything. It's magic.

01:23:42.183 --> 01:23:46.437
See? That's my world!
He's gone over to my world!

01:23:47.188 --> 01:23:50.024
The door, it must still be open. Come on!

01:23:51.026 --> 01:23:53.861
I'm not worried that you're crazy anymore.

01:23:54.779 --> 01:23:57.072
I'm worried that you're right.

01:23:58.867 --> 01:24:01.201
But if I go, how do I get back?

01:24:01.369 --> 01:24:04.329
You can't go through life
nitpicking every little thing.

01:24:04.414 --> 01:24:05.914
Now, come on!

01:24:11.212 --> 01:24:12.838
The hell with it.

01:24:19.429 --> 01:24:21.430
There was nothing to it.

01:24:23.933 --> 01:24:27.811
- We're still here.
- Are you sure about that? Look.

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:34.068
Quickly! Quickly!

01:24:36.237 --> 01:24:39.281
- I want to see if Nick's okay.
- There's no time. Come on.

01:24:42.577 --> 01:24:45.496
What the hell? We're in New York.

01:24:45.997 --> 01:24:47.915
Jack, it all makes sense.

01:24:47.999 --> 01:24:51.668
No, actually it makes absolutely no sense,
but I'll try to explain it you. Later.

01:24:51.795 --> 01:24:55.339
Meantime, please be careful.
Things work different here.

01:24:59.511 --> 01:25:02.179
- Get out!
- All right. Don't get feisty.

01:25:02.806 --> 01:25:06.225
- The car's a piece ofjunk, anyway.
- Drive, bonehead!

01:25:09.437 --> 01:25:12.481
Here's another explosion for your movie, kid.

01:25:18.321 --> 01:25:20.531
Not a word. Not one word.

01:25:31.835 --> 01:25:35.420
- My hand. It really hurts.
- Things work different here.

01:25:35.505 --> 01:25:38.507
You can't smash a car window with your
bare hand and not have it hurt.

01:25:38.591 --> 01:25:42.344
Thanks for sharing.
You couldn't have told me this earlier?

01:25:46.182 --> 01:25:50.519
- I think the taxis are bulletproof.
- Jack, We got to get that ticket back.

01:26:10.081 --> 01:26:14.418
No way, Slater. Please. Listen to me.
It won't work, you hear me?

01:26:14.752 --> 01:26:17.546
You can't play chicken in real life.
You'll crash!

01:26:17.630 --> 01:26:19.548
Out of the car, amigo.

01:26:20.091 --> 01:26:23.677
This isn't the movies anymore, Jack.
Here, you have to reload guns...

01:26:23.761 --> 01:26:27.181
- Go, Danny! Get out!
- Car crashes can kill you! You hear me?

01:26:28.183 --> 01:26:32.561
You are going to die! Jack!

01:26:33.897 --> 01:26:35.439
What did I do?

01:26:42.947 --> 01:26:44.698
Oh, Christ, please.

01:26:56.044 --> 01:26:57.586
Damn it, that hurt.

01:26:57.670 --> 01:27:00.881
You're lucky you're still alive,
you dumb idiot!

01:27:00.965 --> 01:27:06.261
Hey, '89 Mercury Sable,
standard driver's-side air bag.

01:27:06.512 --> 01:27:09.097
Checker Cab, no air bag. Who is dumb?

01:27:09.182 --> 01:27:11.558
Okay, okay. Just make sure they're dead.

01:27:11.643 --> 01:27:13.977
- Give me a break. They're dead.
- Just check, will you?

01:27:14.062 --> 01:27:17.856
- Look. Dead.
- They always look dead! Like in Die Hard.

01:27:17.941 --> 01:27:22.653
The guy's hanging there by his neck
and at the end of the movie he comes back.

01:27:24.822 --> 01:27:27.199
All right. Make sure to cover me.

01:27:27.408 --> 01:27:29.993
I think he's got a windshield wiper.

01:27:36.125 --> 01:27:38.126
Maybe he used the ticket.

01:27:41.130 --> 01:27:43.465
Maybe it's on all the time now.

01:27:58.022 --> 01:27:59.815
What is this place?

01:28:01.484 --> 01:28:03.026
Where am I now?

01:28:06.072 --> 01:28:09.491
Danny, you got a place I can sit down?

01:28:11.786 --> 01:28:13.787
Yeah. Come on.

01:28:16.708 --> 01:28:18.292
Nick! Nick!

01:28:18.751 --> 01:28:22.921
Danny. Oh, my God.
I was so worried. Are you okay?

01:28:23.131 --> 01:28:25.215
Did you see what happened?

01:28:25.383 --> 01:28:27.801
No, I slept the sleep of the dead, kid,
in here until

01:28:27.885 --> 01:28:30.971
I woke up at 2:00 in the morning
and I figured you'd gone home.

01:28:31.055 --> 01:28:33.807
I wasn't home, Nick. I was in the movie.

01:28:35.685 --> 01:28:38.979
I'm getting a little up in years, kid.
Define "in."

01:28:39.272 --> 01:28:41.398
Whitney kissed me on the mouth.

01:28:41.482 --> 01:28:45.360
I drove one of those great big cranes and
dropped Leo the Fart in the La Brea Tar Pits.

01:28:45.445 --> 01:28:48.488
I was with Jack Slater every step of the way!

01:28:52.243 --> 01:28:54.202
Oh, my God.

01:28:56.789 --> 01:28:58.582
The ticket works?

01:29:00.084 --> 01:29:04.212
I could have used it all this time
and I never used it 'cause I...

01:29:04.756 --> 01:29:06.590
I was too frightened.

01:29:08.259 --> 01:29:11.303
But it's not too late. I can still go visit

01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:14.348
Garbo in Camille.

01:29:15.850 --> 01:29:18.935
Jean Harlow. Oh, boy, I had a crush...

01:29:20.313 --> 01:29:22.105
Monroe in Bus Stop.

01:29:25.610 --> 01:29:30.238
Forgive me for going on like that, sir.
I'm a great admirer of your work, too.

01:29:30.656 --> 01:29:32.908
Nick, it isn't who you think.

01:29:34.243 --> 01:29:36.411
You mean, it's... Is he...

01:29:37.622 --> 01:29:40.624
This is a wonderful moment
for me, Mr. Slater.

01:29:40.792 --> 01:29:43.919
I've never met a fictional character before.

01:29:45.630 --> 01:29:48.632
How new and exciting
this must all be for you.

01:29:50.051 --> 01:29:52.928
Hey, I just found out I was imaginary.

01:29:53.471 --> 01:29:56.765
I mean, how would you feel if you found out
that somebody made you up?

01:29:56.849 --> 01:30:00.435
Your job, your marriage, your kids.

01:30:02.271 --> 01:30:05.315
Oh, yeah.
Let's push his son off the building.

01:30:05.691 --> 01:30:07.901
Gives you nightmares the rest of your life.

01:30:07.985 --> 01:30:11.279
But you're fictional, so who cares? I'm sorry,

01:30:11.656 --> 01:30:13.782
but I don't find it so new and exciting
to discover

01:30:13.866 --> 01:30:16.159
that my whole life has been a damn movie.

01:30:16.244 --> 01:30:18.912
Well, you're young and impressionable.

01:30:19.997 --> 01:30:22.791
You know,
there's lots worse things than movies.

01:30:22.875 --> 01:30:28.672
There's politicians and wars and forest fires,
and famine and plague...

01:30:30.508 --> 01:30:34.719
- Sickness, pain, warts, politicians...
- You already mentioned them.

01:30:35.012 --> 01:30:38.348
I know I did.
They're twice as bad as anything else.

01:30:39.308 --> 01:30:42.602
Most of my life's been movies, too.
Well, showing them.

01:30:42.687 --> 01:30:45.021
But that's all over for me now.

01:30:45.815 --> 01:30:50.068
The theater's shut. I'm gonna clear out
my stuff, and then it's the wrecking ball.

01:30:50.153 --> 01:30:54.406
But now, I got another chance.
Could I have the ticket back, please?

01:30:54.699 --> 01:30:58.452
Well... We've got this one little

01:31:00.663 --> 01:31:03.206
- hiccup.
- What do you mean "hiccup"?

01:31:04.375 --> 01:31:07.419
Benedict's here, too, and he's got the ticket.

01:31:07.545 --> 01:31:09.880
That madman with the glass eye?

01:31:13.718 --> 01:31:17.471
- How the hell are you going to get back?
- That's a good question.

01:31:17.555 --> 01:31:20.557
But we wouldn't want to nitpick.
Right, Danny?

01:31:25.188 --> 01:31:27.522
Now, you just follow my lead.

01:31:32.653 --> 01:31:36.406
Where have you been?
Have you got any idea what time it is?

01:31:36.741 --> 01:31:39.951
The police called.
You're not there, you're not here.

01:31:40.036 --> 01:31:41.870
Mom, I'm sorry. Okay?

01:31:43.247 --> 01:31:44.289
"Okay?"

01:31:45.041 --> 01:31:47.626
There are nine million kids
out there with guns

01:31:47.710 --> 01:31:50.921
and that's all
you have to say to me, "Okay?"

01:31:51.464 --> 01:31:54.341
- Will you get in here?
- Well... Mom, wait.

01:31:55.259 --> 01:31:58.929
You know how you always say
you wished I had more friends?

01:31:59.180 --> 01:32:00.430
Well...

01:32:08.439 --> 01:32:10.273
Hello, Mrs. Madigan.

01:32:11.150 --> 01:32:13.068
Arnold Braunschweiger.

01:32:32.755 --> 01:32:35.173
Sweetheart, want to have a party?

01:32:39.512 --> 01:32:42.138
- How old are you?
- Forget it.

01:32:53.109 --> 01:32:58.488
No, you get the shoes! Take the shoes!
Come on, we ain't got time. Come on!

01:33:02.618 --> 01:33:04.160
Take his shoes?

01:33:29.020 --> 01:33:30.395
No screams?

01:33:34.108 --> 01:33:35.483
No sirens?

01:33:41.032 --> 01:33:42.365
Excuse me!

01:33:44.368 --> 01:33:46.536
- Excuse me!
- Yeah?

01:33:49.206 --> 01:33:53.335
I'm sorry to bother you.
I wonder if you'd help me test a theory.

01:33:53.419 --> 01:33:55.545
Sure. What can I do for you?

01:33:56.589 --> 01:33:57.839
Well...

01:34:16.734 --> 01:34:17.901
Hello?

01:34:19.570 --> 01:34:22.947
I've just shot somebody. I did it on purpose!

01:34:28.371 --> 01:34:33.541
I said, I have murdered a man,
and I want to confess!

01:34:34.418 --> 01:34:36.419
Hey, shut up down there!

01:34:41.676 --> 01:34:46.179
I don't know what to say.
I feel a little shy and embarrassed right now,

01:34:46.263 --> 01:34:50.183
but, I mean, I understand that,
for some reason, we look alike.

01:34:50.976 --> 01:34:52.143
It's crazy...

01:34:52.228 --> 01:34:56.940
The thing is, you really do look uncannily
like him except for one thing, the eyes.

01:34:57.024 --> 01:35:00.735
- You are obviously much more intelligent.
- Thank you.

01:35:00.820 --> 01:35:03.530
Good morning. Good afternoon.
Good to see you.

01:35:03.614 --> 01:35:05.240
What kind of eggs do you want?

01:35:05.324 --> 01:35:09.077
Scrambled.
Have you guys been up all night?

01:35:09.161 --> 01:35:11.246
Why didn't you tell me that Jack was a cop

01:35:11.330 --> 01:35:13.039
and why didn't you tell me
you spent the whole night

01:35:13.124 --> 01:35:14.999
in a police station looking at mug shots?

01:35:15.084 --> 01:35:17.335
You could have taken two minutes
to call your mother.

01:35:17.420 --> 01:35:19.671
Why didn't you tell me you had no friends?

01:35:19.755 --> 01:35:22.257
And what is this business
about going to the movies at midnight

01:35:22.341 --> 01:35:25.176
when you knew
your mother would be worried?

01:35:29.014 --> 01:35:33.935
Mom. You turned him into a wimp.

01:35:34.562 --> 01:35:36.730
Oh, I think not. Toast?

01:35:37.064 --> 01:35:38.481
No, thanks.

01:35:39.817 --> 01:35:42.193
Jack, are you okay?

01:35:44.488 --> 01:35:45.822
We talked.

01:35:46.157 --> 01:35:49.826
I mean, I never just talked
to a woman before. It's neat.

01:35:50.619 --> 01:35:51.745
Neat?

01:35:53.998 --> 01:35:57.375
Wimp. Next, they'll be talking about sex.

01:35:58.794 --> 01:36:02.255
Me and Jack are going out today!
I'm helping him on a case!

01:36:02.339 --> 01:36:03.298
Oh, no.

01:36:03.382 --> 01:36:06.760
Your license to kill
expired at 4:00 this morning, young man.

01:36:06.844 --> 01:36:09.012
Get in here and eat some eggs.

01:36:10.473 --> 01:36:14.225
Mom, I have to help. I'm the only witness.

01:36:14.310 --> 01:36:16.936
You know, like the kid in the movie
with Harrison Ford?

01:36:17.021 --> 01:36:18.980
There is no comparison.

01:36:19.857 --> 01:36:21.065
We're not Jewish.

01:36:21.150 --> 01:36:23.276
- Amish.
- Whatever-ish!

01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:29.115
Irene. Don't worry. It won't be that hard.
There are eight million in this city.

01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:31.117
And I'm very good at catching people.

01:36:31.202 --> 01:36:35.705
Yeah! And the future of
the world may be at stake, and, and maybe...

01:36:38.918 --> 01:36:40.835
Could you turn this up, please?

01:36:45.758 --> 01:36:47.175
What's that?

01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:50.386
- Mozart.
- The guy Practice killed?

01:36:52.973 --> 01:36:54.766
That's right, Jack.

01:36:55.518 --> 01:36:57.560
You like classical music?

01:37:00.356 --> 01:37:04.651
I don't know. I think I will. Wow.

01:37:14.662 --> 01:37:17.080
You tell my mom who you really were?

01:37:17.164 --> 01:37:18.665
Yeah, a cop from LA.

01:37:18.749 --> 01:37:20.124
I mean, really.

01:37:20.751 --> 01:37:23.378
Well, real enough. For right now.

01:37:25.923 --> 01:37:28.258
So you think for sure
you're going to catch him?

01:37:28.342 --> 01:37:30.426
I always catch everybody.

01:37:30.511 --> 01:37:32.846
And you're going to spot him from up here?

01:37:32.930 --> 01:37:37.267
Hey, give me a break.
It's the first time I've been to anyplace real.

01:37:39.603 --> 01:37:41.771
Now, this ticket of yours...

01:37:42.439 --> 01:37:44.566
It worked in one movie.

01:37:45.234 --> 01:37:47.610
Does that mean
that Benedict could use it again?

01:37:47.695 --> 01:37:50.780
You mean on other movies?
Why would he want to do that?

01:37:52.533 --> 01:37:54.242
I don't know.

01:37:56.078 --> 01:37:57.453
But it's a start.

01:37:57.997 --> 01:38:00.582
The possibilities are limitless.

01:38:00.666 --> 01:38:03.668
But I realized after the car crash

01:38:03.752 --> 01:38:06.379
that the ultimate freedom
would always elude me

01:38:06.463 --> 01:38:10.717
until Jack Slater was,
and forgive the pun, taken out of the picture.

01:38:11.635 --> 01:38:16.431
And I thought perhaps
you might like to be inclined to help.

01:38:18.767 --> 01:38:23.104
Look, I understand that
all this must be strange and difficult for you,

01:38:23.188 --> 01:38:27.483
but if you do this right,
the world is your oyster. Trust me.

01:38:29.653 --> 01:38:33.114
You can have complete freedom
to do whatever you want.

01:38:34.074 --> 01:38:36.409
Beyond even your wildest dreams.

01:38:37.703 --> 01:38:41.873
And you'll never have to
go back to this film again.

01:38:45.044 --> 01:38:49.964
Now I know you've never heard of this man,
but his actual name, believe it or not,

01:38:50.049 --> 01:38:52.050
is Arnold Schwarzenegger.

01:38:53.844 --> 01:38:56.512
Jack, there's got to be a thousand theaters
in this city

01:38:56.597 --> 01:38:58.348
and we've been looking for five hours.

01:38:58.474 --> 01:39:00.683
We are that close in catching him.

01:39:00.768 --> 01:39:02.769
No, Jack.
We're that close to catching pneumonia.

01:39:02.853 --> 01:39:05.939
- Look, in my world, they just leave clues.
- But we're not in your world!

01:39:06.023 --> 01:39:08.066
Or they just show up and then kidnap me.

01:39:08.150 --> 01:39:12.278
That kind of stuff doesn't happen here, Jack,
because this world stinks!

01:39:12.363 --> 01:39:15.448
Hey.
The world is what you make of it, Danny.

01:39:15.532 --> 01:39:18.952
Now if you want to give up
and go home, then go ahead.

01:39:20.371 --> 01:39:23.247
You believed in me in the movies.
Why not now?

01:39:23.332 --> 01:39:25.458
Because here, you're just...

01:39:27.461 --> 01:39:28.836
Just what?

01:39:48.941 --> 01:39:52.068
Jack... Jack, there he is!

01:40:07.459 --> 01:40:08.584
Jack!

01:40:16.427 --> 01:40:17.635
Are you nuts?

01:40:18.929 --> 01:40:20.805
- Damn it!
- Hey, you crazy asshole!

01:40:20.889 --> 01:40:22.223
Jack, he's just a cabbie!

01:40:22.307 --> 01:40:23.683
You've seen those movies where they say,

01:40:23.767 --> 01:40:25.727
"Make my day"
or "I am your worst nightmare."

01:40:25.811 --> 01:40:28.980
Well, listen to this one,
rubber baby buggy bumpers.

01:40:29.064 --> 01:40:31.774
Ha! You didn't know I'm gonna say that,
did you?

01:40:33.193 --> 01:40:34.527
- Where did he go? Talk!
- How would I know?

01:40:34.611 --> 01:40:37.405
The guy was in the back reading the paper.

01:40:39.867 --> 01:40:43.536
You were right, Jack.
He has been going to the movies.

01:40:43.620 --> 01:40:46.039
Kid, that ain't the half of it.

01:40:48.083 --> 01:40:51.461
Hi, I'm Army Archerd,
and we are live to you from New York.

01:40:51.545 --> 01:40:53.755
We're just moments away
from the world premiere of

01:40:53.839 --> 01:40:57.050
Arnold Schwarzenegger's Jack Slater IV.

01:40:57.134 --> 01:41:00.595
And here's the man they've come to see,
folks. There's no mistaking that car.

01:41:00.679 --> 01:41:05.767
Here they are, Arnold Schwarzenegger
and his lovely wife, Maria Shriver.

01:41:07.895 --> 01:41:10.772
- So good to see you all.
- Are you a big-time fan of Jack Slater films?

01:41:10.856 --> 01:41:15.401
I've enjoyed...
It was just beautiful... I just loved it.

01:41:15.486 --> 01:41:17.570
The National Enquirer. Don't talk to them.
Okay?

01:41:17.654 --> 01:41:20.615
Hi, how are you?
Look, Time magazine. That's great. Hi.

01:41:20.783 --> 01:41:22.992
Hi. How are you? Hello.

01:41:23.619 --> 01:41:25.536
Now remember, don't plug the restaurants.

01:41:25.621 --> 01:41:29.082
I just hate it when you plug
the restaurants or the gyms. It's so tacky.

01:41:29.166 --> 01:41:30.666
So why was he going to the movies?

01:41:30.751 --> 01:41:31.918
Maybe to get help.

01:41:32.002 --> 01:41:35.755
Benedict can do damn near anything
with the ticket, but we still know who he is.

01:41:35.839 --> 01:41:38.508
- So he's got to take us out.
- He can't get to you.

01:41:38.592 --> 01:41:42.762
Suppose he doesn't have to get to me.
Suppose all he has to do is get to him.

01:41:42.846 --> 01:41:45.306
Benedict is going to kill Schwarzenegger.

01:41:45.390 --> 01:41:49.435
- Who's Schwarzenegger, who's Slater.
- Bingo.

01:41:51.188 --> 01:41:52.855
We kill less people in this movie.

01:41:52.940 --> 01:41:55.191
This movie we only killed 48 people

01:41:55.275 --> 01:41:57.860
compared to the last one,
where we killed 119.

01:41:57.945 --> 01:41:59.987
And I want to make sure that the action fans
understand

01:42:00.072 --> 01:42:04.033
we make up for it with a good story,
lot of emotions, depth, dimensions...

01:42:04.535 --> 01:42:06.410
There are thousands in attendance
here tonight.

01:42:06.495 --> 01:42:09.455
And millions more are
listening to us live around the world.

01:42:09.540 --> 01:42:12.208
I'm going to direct it,
produce it, and star in it.

01:42:12.292 --> 01:42:14.460
- Is this guy a success story, or what?
- It's unbelievable.

01:42:14.545 --> 01:42:15.795
Only in America.

01:42:15.879 --> 01:42:17.421
Well, only in Hollywood, I would say.

01:42:17.506 --> 01:42:19.006
And talking about Hollywood,

01:42:19.091 --> 01:42:22.468
at Planet Hollywood, we have this incredible
memorabilia. Yes, I'm telling you...

01:42:22.553 --> 01:42:24.345
Excuse us, we're just gonna get going.
Thanks very much.

01:42:24.429 --> 01:42:25.930
...absolutely fabulous. I'm telling you.

01:42:26.014 --> 01:42:28.307
You embarrassed me, you low-forehead.
It was humiliating.

01:42:28.392 --> 01:42:30.059
How could you do something like that?

01:42:31.270 --> 01:42:34.647
Chris, check this out. Look, it's the Ripper
from Jack Slater III.

01:42:34.731 --> 01:42:36.190
Scary.

01:42:36.567 --> 01:42:39.652
Let's "ax" him a question, okay?
See if we can get him over here.

01:42:39.736 --> 01:42:41.070
Wow, will you look at this?
A method villain.

01:42:41.155 --> 01:42:43.865
Rip, Rip, come here.
What brings you here tonight?

01:42:43.949 --> 01:42:48.703
I... I thought I might kill someone.

01:42:49.705 --> 01:42:51.497
Maybe you should start with
your designer.

01:42:51.582 --> 01:42:54.709
Nobody wants to miss out tonight.
The limos just keep coming.

01:42:54.793 --> 01:42:57.503
The stars are really shining in Times Square.

01:42:57.588 --> 01:43:00.715
Excuse me, sir.
Could I see your invitation?

01:43:02.384 --> 01:43:05.428
Pete, it's okay.
He's with me. I'm his agent.

01:43:05.512 --> 01:43:07.555
Jesus Christ, Tom, come here.

01:43:07.639 --> 01:43:10.141
My goodness, it's Tom Noonan, of course,

01:43:10.225 --> 01:43:13.686
the actor who played the Ripper.
Who plays the Rip...

01:43:13.770 --> 01:43:14.770
What?

01:43:14.855 --> 01:43:17.190
What are you, nuts? You want to play
ax killers the rest of your life?

01:43:17.274 --> 01:43:18.357
Honey, honey, come here.

01:43:18.442 --> 01:43:20.276
I'm gonna need the manager's office
for about five, 10 minutes.

01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:21.986
- I'm sorry, sir...
- You're sorry? Here's 50 bucks.

01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:23.070
How sorry are you now?

01:43:23.155 --> 01:43:25.156
What do you think
Jack Slater says about America?

01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:26.574
I really want to hear it.

01:43:26.658 --> 01:43:27.658
I don't really want to hear it.

01:43:27.743 --> 01:43:31.454
I'm not really a big fan ofArnold's
but she is, you know.

01:43:32.289 --> 01:43:36.626
Arnold really turns her on and I just want to
be there when it happens, that's all.

01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:39.670
Good, Tom, you got the props, too.
That's terrific.

01:43:39.755 --> 01:43:41.964
Why don't you just whip a hibachi
out from under your coat there?

01:43:42.049 --> 01:43:44.217
And we could make some shish kebabs
for the critics. That'd be good.

01:43:44.301 --> 01:43:47.136
You're lucky I have a friend
who rents tuxedos.

01:43:47.221 --> 01:43:50.932
Hello. Yeah. I know it's late. Tell him it's me.

01:43:52.059 --> 01:43:54.560
Did Nicholson show up to the premiere
of Batman dressed as the Joker?

01:43:54.645 --> 01:43:56.395
I don't think so.

01:43:57.022 --> 01:43:59.565
Hi, Murray,
get me your brother-in-law, will you?

01:43:59.650 --> 01:44:01.108
Yes, it's important.

01:44:01.193 --> 01:44:04.612
It fits nice. Moving the button was
a good idea. Just get...

01:44:04.696 --> 01:44:06.739
Hey, Marv. Yeah, I need a tux.

01:44:10.994 --> 01:44:13.454
- What the hell was that?
- Hey! Watch it!

01:44:13.538 --> 01:44:16.540
You're a big action guy.
What do you think about this?

01:44:16.625 --> 01:44:19.001
I would never miss
the premiere for a second.

01:44:19.086 --> 01:44:23.547
Where am I sitting? Where?
Where am I sitting?

01:44:24.383 --> 01:44:25.675
There's two balconies.

01:44:25.759 --> 01:44:29.345
I believe you're in the upper...
Lower balcony.

01:44:29.429 --> 01:44:30.930
- You stay here...
- Yeah, I know. I stay here.

01:44:31.014 --> 01:44:32.390
And be careful.

01:44:43.485 --> 01:44:47.989
Somebody should
be checking that other balcony. Definitely!

01:44:58.750 --> 01:45:01.627
Arnold, look. Deal's done, right?

01:45:02.254 --> 01:45:04.672
- What?
- Slater V, the soundtrack.

01:45:47.799 --> 01:45:49.675
I'll be a son of a...

01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:51.218
Jack!

01:45:51.303 --> 01:45:54.805
Jack! It's the Ripper!
He's brought back the Ripper!

01:45:56.475 --> 01:45:59.268
Jack, Benedict's brought back the Ripper!

01:46:02.939 --> 01:46:05.274
Everybody down! Now!

01:46:11.114 --> 01:46:12.573
Get off me!

01:46:20.999 --> 01:46:22.792
Get the hell off me.

01:46:24.544 --> 01:46:27.713
The studio should let me know
when they're planning a stunt.

01:46:27.798 --> 01:46:31.133
You know, you are the best
celebrity look-alike I've ever seen.

01:46:32.636 --> 01:46:33.886
Why not?

01:46:45.649 --> 01:46:47.566
Hey, if you get to Los Angeles,

01:46:47.651 --> 01:46:50.361
call my office.
We can get you shopping center openings...

01:46:50.445 --> 01:46:54.615
Look, I don't really like you. All right?
You've brought me nothing but pain.

01:46:54.699 --> 01:46:56.409
Jack, help!

01:46:59.329 --> 01:47:01.205
Did anyone come out of here?

01:47:01.289 --> 01:47:03.499
Did you see anyone come out here?

01:47:04.793 --> 01:47:07.795
Did you see a crazy guy with an ax
coming out of here?

01:47:07.879 --> 01:47:09.338
No, no. I didn't.

01:47:21.101 --> 01:47:24.228
Hey, Jack. What kept you?

01:47:27.691 --> 01:47:29.692
Are you all right, Danny?

01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:31.986
Yes... Yes, sir.

01:47:35.782 --> 01:47:38.826
You know, I tried to change, Jack.

01:47:38.910 --> 01:47:45.749
I really tried to do what he told me to do,
but you know, I kept hearing that old music.

01:47:47.002 --> 01:47:49.712
That's how I knew you'd come here, Jack.

01:47:51.131 --> 01:47:52.548
Now, lose the piece.

01:47:57.554 --> 01:47:58.679
There.

01:47:59.514 --> 01:48:03.100
It's now between you and me,
so let the boy go.

01:48:03.185 --> 01:48:06.145
Hey, we've played this number before,
haven't we, Jack?

01:48:06.229 --> 01:48:07.938
Let's see, what comes next?

01:48:08.398 --> 01:48:13.569
You throw the gun away, right?
We did that part and...

01:48:14.571 --> 01:48:18.699
And then you tell me to let the kid go and...

01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:23.287
I'm getting bored.
Why don't we just skip to the end?

01:48:35.592 --> 01:48:38.469
Come on, Jack! Come on.

01:48:38.553 --> 01:48:40.846
Over here, right here, Jack. Come on.
Right here.

01:48:40.931 --> 01:48:45.935
Come on, Jack! Let's go, man.
Come here, Jack. Come on, Jack.

01:48:46.019 --> 01:48:49.730
Let's go, let's go. Come on. Let's do it, Jack.

01:49:09.501 --> 01:49:15.214
I'll be back!

01:49:21.471 --> 01:49:23.180
The hell you will.

01:49:27.435 --> 01:49:29.186
Jack!

01:49:30.939 --> 01:49:32.815
- Danny?
- Jack, please!

01:49:32.899 --> 01:49:34.233
Danny!

01:49:36.152 --> 01:49:39.822
Danny! I'll be right there.
I'm coming! Hang on!

01:49:44.744 --> 01:49:46.579
Just hang on now.

01:49:49.666 --> 01:49:53.627
- Jack, help!
- Hold on, Danny! I'll be right there.

01:49:55.589 --> 01:49:57.006
I'm coming.

01:49:58.216 --> 01:49:59.842
Jack, hurry!

01:50:00.427 --> 01:50:03.345
Hold on, Danny, and don't look down!

01:50:05.557 --> 01:50:08.017
Oh, God, please, don't let him die.

01:50:09.769 --> 01:50:11.353
Now, listen, kid.

01:50:12.188 --> 01:50:14.898
You grab my hand, and we get out of here.

01:50:15.817 --> 01:50:18.360
I can't, Jack. We'll fall.

01:50:18.445 --> 01:50:22.072
Come on, now. Danny, trust me.

01:50:23.408 --> 01:50:24.533
I can't do it, Jack.

01:50:24.618 --> 01:50:26.869
Listen to me, Danny. Listen to me.

01:50:26.953 --> 01:50:29.455
You hold on with your feet, with your legs

01:50:29.539 --> 01:50:35.127
and you let your hands go
and I will catch you. Okay? Believe in me.

01:50:35.211 --> 01:50:39.298
I will catch you. Now, get my hand. Let's go.

01:50:39.382 --> 01:50:42.593
Go for it, now. Come on, Danny. Yes.

01:51:03.031 --> 01:51:05.449
This hero stuff has its limits.

01:51:13.458 --> 01:51:18.003
I need a hospital.
I think my shoulder is out of the socket.

01:51:18.088 --> 01:51:20.422
Will the morgue suffice?

01:51:21.716 --> 01:51:23.092
Get down, Danny.

01:51:28.431 --> 01:51:32.851
Give it up, Benedict.
The whole lobby is swarming with cops.

01:51:32.936 --> 01:51:37.064
I think I can manage to avoid them,
but if not,

01:51:37.148 --> 01:51:40.943
I've another
little explosive surprise for them.

01:51:44.447 --> 01:51:47.491
Gentlemen, since
you're about to die anyway,

01:51:47.575 --> 01:51:51.370
I may as well tell you the entire plot.

01:51:51.454 --> 01:51:57.042
Think of villains, Jack.
You want Dracula? Dracula? Hang on.

01:51:57.585 --> 01:52:02.798
I'll fetch him. Dracula. I can get King Kong.

01:52:03.299 --> 01:52:08.554
We'll have a nightmare with Freddy Krueger.
Have a surprise party for Adolf Hitler.

01:52:08.638 --> 01:52:10.973
Hannibal Lecter can do the catering.

01:52:11.057 --> 01:52:14.977
And then we'll all
have a christening for Rosemary's baby.

01:52:17.105 --> 01:52:21.066
All I have to do
is snap my fingers and they'll be here.

01:52:21.151 --> 01:52:24.737
They're lining up to get here,
and do you know why, Jack?

01:52:24.821 --> 01:52:26.572
Shall I tell you why?

01:52:26.656 --> 01:52:31.660
Because here in this world,
the bad guys can win.

01:52:33.037 --> 01:52:35.164
I shall miss you, Jack.

01:52:43.506 --> 01:52:49.845
Gee, did you make a movie mistake!
You forgot to reload the damn gun.

01:52:49.929 --> 01:52:53.849
No, Jack. I just left one chamber empty.

01:53:00.398 --> 01:53:01.857
Son of a...

01:53:10.116 --> 01:53:12.868
My arm! You broke my arm!

01:53:17.499 --> 01:53:18.999
You see, Jack,

01:53:20.376 --> 01:53:23.170
bad guys can win.

01:53:39.062 --> 01:53:40.270
Jack!

01:53:42.065 --> 01:53:43.565
Now!

01:53:44.734 --> 01:53:47.027
No sequel for you.

01:53:54.369 --> 01:53:55.744
The ticket.

01:54:47.797 --> 01:54:49.298
Take him home.

01:54:49.924 --> 01:54:53.135
Take him back to
where this is just a flesh wound.

01:54:55.471 --> 01:54:59.808
Don't you understand?
We got to get him back to the movies.

01:55:01.644 --> 01:55:03.729
I said turn around.

01:55:08.985 --> 01:55:12.654
Great! Just great!
They always run away.

01:55:12.739 --> 01:55:14.281
Hang on, Jack.

01:55:16.367 --> 01:55:19.286
Danny, do you know how to drive?

01:55:19.370 --> 01:55:21.330
Sure. I watched you, didn't I?

01:55:59.535 --> 01:56:01.536
Get out of the way!

01:56:12.507 --> 01:56:15.467
Nick, fire up the projector. Hurry!

01:56:15.551 --> 01:56:16.885
- Slater's dying.
- What happened?

01:56:16.970 --> 01:56:21.223
- You got the ticket?
- No, but it's got to work, anyway. It's got to!

01:56:35.238 --> 01:56:38.281
Just hold on, Jack. You'll make it.
This is gonna work.

01:56:40.743 --> 01:56:42.244
It's got to be here, Jack.

01:56:48.126 --> 01:56:52.462
Please, please.
Nick, hurry! The door won't open.

01:56:52.547 --> 01:56:55.882
No sweat, kid. You tried.

01:56:58.720 --> 01:57:00.679
It's got to be here.

01:57:09.689 --> 01:57:11.106
Just hold...

01:57:15.028 --> 01:57:19.031
Where do you think you're going?
Back off. You can't have him.

01:57:19.115 --> 01:57:22.784
I've had it up to here with you, Mister.
Who stays, who goes...

01:57:22.869 --> 01:57:26.163
Well, I'm telling you this one stays.

01:57:32.003 --> 01:57:33.795
I was only curious.

01:57:35.214 --> 01:57:38.050
He's not on any of my lists.

01:57:39.135 --> 01:57:42.137
Though you are, Daniel.

01:57:44.265 --> 01:57:45.599
Now?

01:57:45.683 --> 01:57:46.892
Oh, no.

01:57:48.061 --> 01:57:49.978
You die a grandfather.

01:57:57.278 --> 01:58:00.864
Hey, wait a minute. Help us.

01:58:01.657 --> 01:58:05.243
You got to get him back.
You can do it. I know you can.

01:58:05.328 --> 01:58:11.792
I don't do fiction. Not my field. Sorry.

01:58:14.504 --> 01:58:17.422
You are a very brave young man.

01:58:19.926 --> 01:58:22.677
Unfortunately, you're not very bright.

01:58:23.471 --> 01:58:25.055
If I were you...

01:58:28.601 --> 01:58:31.895
I might be looking
for the other half of the ticket.

01:58:41.114 --> 01:58:44.866
They're all gold. They're all gold.

01:58:46.661 --> 01:58:48.161
Yes!

01:58:50.373 --> 01:58:54.000
I've got it, Jack. I'll get you home, you'll see.

01:58:55.503 --> 01:58:57.003
You can't die.

01:58:58.047 --> 01:59:02.676
I know. Not until the grosses go down.

01:59:02.760 --> 01:59:05.720
No. This is going to save us.

01:59:08.015 --> 01:59:11.685
Throw that silly thing away.

01:59:13.813 --> 01:59:15.397
Holy cow!

01:59:38.421 --> 01:59:41.464
Let's hear it for Houdini!

01:59:45.511 --> 01:59:49.598
Slater!

01:59:50.391 --> 01:59:52.684
Damn it. Anybody seen Slater?

01:59:52.768 --> 01:59:56.438
You see Slater,
you tell him to get in my office right now.

02:00:14.290 --> 02:00:16.166
Help, somebody!

02:00:17.168 --> 02:00:22.130
They got Jack! Doctor! Hey, doc! Move!

02:00:23.466 --> 02:00:27.636
Here, take this. You've got to get back
before it changes its mind.

02:00:27.720 --> 02:00:30.722
No way. I'm not going to leave you.

02:00:30.806 --> 02:00:34.684
I'm just an imaginary hero, Danny.
You have a real life.

02:00:35.645 --> 02:00:38.980
You're real to me. Don't you get it?

02:00:39.774 --> 02:00:44.069
You're the best thing in... I need you to...

02:00:44.528 --> 02:00:48.573
To be here where you can always find me
but I need you to be out there.

02:00:48.658 --> 02:00:49.866
To believe in me.

02:00:49.951 --> 02:00:51.284
Doctor, doctor!

02:00:51.369 --> 02:00:56.623
I need you to take care of your mother for me
'cause... Oh, I would love to...

02:00:58.834 --> 02:01:00.460
You have your whole life ahead of you.

02:01:00.544 --> 02:01:03.672
And pimples and premature ejaculation.
I heard.

02:01:07.885 --> 02:01:10.512
- What?
- It's just...

02:01:12.181 --> 02:01:15.141
I'm scared I'm never going to see you again.

02:01:17.228 --> 02:01:22.357
Whoever thinks that,
will be making a big mistake.

02:01:30.825 --> 02:01:34.327
Get out of the way. Out of the way.
You want a doctor? I'm a doctor.

02:01:34.412 --> 02:01:37.205
Get out of the way.
I'm a doctor. Get out of the way.

02:01:37.331 --> 02:01:40.875
- What happened? What happened, pal?
- What is it, doc?

02:01:47.883 --> 02:01:51.511
What is this, some kind of a joke?
I wouldn't even call this a flesh wound.

02:01:51.595 --> 02:01:53.471
Come on, here, let's get him up.

02:02:11.824 --> 02:02:14.075
Damn it, where the hell have you been?

02:02:16.370 --> 02:02:18.330
Ha. It's working again.

02:02:18.414 --> 02:02:20.832
And you know the cost of that door is
coming right out of your meager

02:02:20.916 --> 02:02:22.042
but undeserved paycheck

02:02:22.126 --> 02:02:24.169
on account of
I got the Save-The-Eagle foundation

02:02:24.253 --> 02:02:26.504
doing a fucking tango up and down
my Hershey Highway!

02:02:26.589 --> 02:02:27.964
Put a sock in it.

02:02:28.049 --> 02:02:30.342
I don't care
who does what to your Hershey Highway,

02:02:30.426 --> 02:02:34.846
and stop shouting. I'm not deaf.
You know why you're shouting?

02:02:34.930 --> 02:02:37.682
Because it's in the script.
You're the comic relief.

02:02:37.767 --> 02:02:42.145
Yes, and you know what else?
I'm the hero so shut up!

02:02:47.735 --> 02:02:51.571
You see, Hollywood is writing our lives
and you know something?

02:02:51.655 --> 02:02:54.324
I don't want to shoot people
anymore and blow up buildings.

02:02:54.492 --> 02:02:55.533
You know why we do this here?

02:02:55.618 --> 02:02:58.620
You got to be a magician, after all, Nick.

02:02:58.954 --> 02:03:00.622
It really does work.

02:03:01.832 --> 02:03:05.460
The ticket's yours, Danny,
and you know something?

02:03:06.921 --> 02:03:09.297
I think the magic was yours, too.

02:03:10.674 --> 02:03:11.966
Come on.

02:03:12.718 --> 02:03:14.677
Ever tell you about the time
I was about your age

02:03:14.762 --> 02:03:17.514
and my pop took me to see Buffalo Bill?

02:03:17.598 --> 02:03:21.059
Yeah, well, we went backstage to see
Sitting Bull who was his medicine man.
