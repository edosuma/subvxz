01:03.424 --> 01:04.757
Where is she?

01:04.759 --> 01:07.593
I'm gonna shoot you
in the head, boy.

01:07.595 --> 01:09.261
Tell me where Suzanne is

01:09.263 --> 01:11.330
and I'll only shoot out
one of your eyes.

01:11.332 --> 01:13.433
Stop fucking around,
Marius.

01:27.615 --> 01:29.883
Maybe you would like it
if I went back inside

01:29.885 --> 01:31.618
and finished her
off first, Will.

01:31.620 --> 01:33.155
Is that
what you'd like?

01:34.456 --> 01:35.624
Five seconds.

01:38.492 --> 01:39.762
One,

01:40.694 --> 01:41.863
two,

01:42.864 --> 01:44.200
three,

01:46.168 --> 01:47.603
four...

01:49.337 --> 01:51.204
Okay.

01:51.206 --> 01:52.408
We're done here.

02:32.479 --> 02:33.882
<i>Uncle?</i>

02:34.582 --> 02:35.683
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

02:36.585 --> 02:38.952
<i>It's Annie.</i>

02:38.954 --> 02:40.789
<i>I need you to know
what happened.</i>

02:42.556 --> 02:43.825
It's okay.

02:44.859 --> 02:46.228
It's like always.

02:47.229 --> 02:48.464
Breathe in,

02:49.764 --> 02:51.332
stop your heart.

02:54.802 --> 02:55.901
Let go.

03:08.383 --> 03:09.514
<i>So do I pass?</i>

03:09.516 --> 03:10.949
<i>Not bad, not bad.</i>

03:10.951 --> 03:12.852
<i>Well, nothing wrong
with the scope, Uncle.</i>

03:12.854 --> 03:14.320
<i>For a gun
from this century.</i>

03:14.322 --> 03:16.388
<i>Anyone can shoot
one of those.</i>

03:16.390 --> 03:18.524
I wanted you to use
a real gun.

03:18.526 --> 03:20.525
- A moshum's gun.
- All right.

03:20.527 --> 03:21.995
Just like those
traps of yours

03:21.997 --> 03:23.529
from the museum
or something.

03:23.531 --> 03:24.731
Pile of rust.

03:24.733 --> 03:26.666
Hey, nothing wrong
with my traps.

03:26.668 --> 03:28.434
Collector's items.

03:28.436 --> 03:30.435
They got some on sale
at the store this week.

03:30.437 --> 03:34.774
Eh, my girl,
nothing wrong with my traps.

03:34.776 --> 03:36.008
Eva's here.

03:36.010 --> 03:37.709
Hey, guys!

03:37.711 --> 03:38.877
Hey, Eva.

03:38.879 --> 03:40.846
I just came to say

03:40.848 --> 03:44.517
that somebody
better get her bags packed.

03:44.519 --> 03:47.419
- Hey?
- Your, like, totally amazing,

03:47.421 --> 03:48.655
best friend ever,

03:48.657 --> 03:51.490
just won at Bingo!

03:51.492 --> 03:53.625
I just bought us
a trip to Toronto!

03:53.627 --> 03:55.597
We leave tomorrow.

03:57.665 --> 03:58.967
What's that look?

03:59.734 --> 04:01.437
I can't go to Toronto.

04:03.504 --> 04:07.639
It's my treat, dummy.
It's on me!

04:07.641 --> 04:10.709
I told your mom we could
go see your lawyer.

04:10.711 --> 04:12.377
What for?

04:12.379 --> 04:14.746
So he can tell us how
he calls the cops every week?

04:14.748 --> 04:15.947
Tells us that on the phone.

04:15.949 --> 04:19.750
Sometimes it's good to make
a man look you in the eyes.

04:19.753 --> 04:21.022
Thought you'd be excited.

04:21.689 --> 04:23.692
I am, for you.

04:24.826 --> 04:26.325
You're saying
you're not going to go?

04:26.327 --> 04:28.094
Gotta get this moose
out of the truck.

04:28.096 --> 04:29.861
Take your sister, okay?

04:29.863 --> 04:31.332
You guys'll have
a great time.

04:31.966 --> 04:33.269
Annie.

04:42.444 --> 04:44.379
Well, what the hell
am I gonna find out?

04:46.014 --> 04:47.983
Eva was just trying to help.

04:56.124 --> 04:58.457
Your mother wants
to go down.

04:58.459 --> 04:59.894
When did she say that?

05:00.894 --> 05:01.961
Last week.

05:01.963 --> 05:03.462
As if.

05:03.464 --> 05:04.832
She couldn't even
get off the train.

05:06.901 --> 05:08.403
I'm gonna take her.

05:09.370 --> 05:10.705
You're not
even funny, Will.

05:11.872 --> 05:13.509
What, you think
I can't figure it out?

05:15.009 --> 05:16.412
We'll go see
that lawyer.

05:17.579 --> 05:19.678
Then we'll go shopping.

05:19.680 --> 05:21.416
I'll take her up
that CN Tower.

05:22.617 --> 05:23.815
You can stop now.

05:23.817 --> 05:24.851
Oh, and that new aquarium,

05:24.853 --> 05:26.519
'cause it's right next
door to the CN Tower.

05:26.521 --> 05:28.154
Saw it on TV,
they got this...

05:28.156 --> 05:29.958
"Dangerous Lagoon" thing.

05:31.425 --> 05:32.992
Fucking Suzanne.

05:32.994 --> 05:34.496
Don't talk about her
like that.

05:37.665 --> 05:39.068
And maybe I can get me

05:39.968 --> 05:41.569
another one of these.

05:42.704 --> 05:45.137
Mmm.
A baseball cap.

05:45.139 --> 05:46.873
It says "Toronto" on it.

05:46.875 --> 05:49.007
Joe's sister gave it to me.

05:49.009 --> 05:50.909
Can't find this
craftsmanship just anywhere.

05:50.911 --> 05:51.979
Mmm.

05:56.684 --> 05:58.817
You know what?
I don't want her to go.

05:58.819 --> 06:01.086
I... I... I just think
it's a bad idea.

06:01.088 --> 06:03.089
No one's forcing her
to go, Lisette.

06:05.459 --> 06:06.829
Look,
someone's gotta go.

06:07.629 --> 06:09.398
Besides, she wants to go.

06:44.199 --> 06:46.498
What if Annie
doesn't come home?

06:46.500 --> 06:48.603
Hey, hey, come here.

06:49.471 --> 06:50.639
It's okay.

08:26.567 --> 08:29.101
Fuck, Will,
just fucking do it.

08:29.103 --> 08:30.937
She's blind
and she's old.

08:30.939 --> 08:32.270
She's no trouble.

08:32.273 --> 08:33.804
You want to play with bears,
you dumb fuck,

08:33.807 --> 08:34.841
go do it someplace else!

08:34.842 --> 08:36.775
My kid and my house
are 10 minutes from here.

08:36.778 --> 08:38.208
I'm telling you,

08:38.211 --> 08:40.011
she's no trouble...

08:40.014 --> 08:41.182
What the fuck, man?

08:44.586 --> 08:45.951
I came here
to have a chat

08:45.953 --> 08:48.256
and you get all fucking
Grizzly Adams on me.

08:50.057 --> 08:52.057
So where's Suzanne?

08:52.059 --> 08:53.895
- We don't know.
- You don't know?

08:55.730 --> 08:58.030
Annie fucks off to Toronto
'cause you don't know.

08:58.032 --> 09:00.065
Eva won at Bingo,
she took her on a vacation.

09:01.336 --> 09:04.002
Why the fuck do I
have to keep repeating myself?

09:04.004 --> 09:05.307
We both want
the same thing.

09:06.274 --> 09:08.306
We find Suzanne,
we find Gus.

09:08.308 --> 09:09.977
We find Gus,
we find Suzanne.

09:10.945 --> 09:12.014
Right?

09:13.081 --> 09:14.147
Right?

09:14.149 --> 09:16.181
It's only a vacation,
they'll be back in a week.

09:17.985 --> 09:19.153
Okay, Will...

09:20.288 --> 09:21.690
We'll chat when
she gets back, eh?

09:22.956 --> 09:24.757
But you keep
snitchin' to the cops,

09:24.759 --> 09:25.925
I'll fucking kill you.

09:25.927 --> 09:27.596
I didn't.

09:28.296 --> 09:29.962
You fuck.

09:29.964 --> 09:31.567
Ah!

10:21.349 --> 10:23.181
There you go, sister.

10:23.183 --> 10:24.685
Moose stew.

10:28.822 --> 10:29.857
Yeah.

10:42.403 --> 10:43.401
<i>Here we are at our hotel.</i>

10:43.403 --> 10:45.438
<i>We're here
in Toronto!</i>

10:45.440 --> 10:47.205
<i>Aren't you so excited?</i>

10:47.207 --> 10:48.406
<i>Yeah.</i>

10:48.408 --> 10:49.974
<i>Big city girls, now.</i>

10:49.976 --> 10:53.045
<i>Oh, look at this big room!</i>

10:53.047 --> 10:54.747
- <i>This is it.</i>
- <i>This is it.</i>

10:54.749 --> 10:56.181
<i>We gotta send this
to your mom, okay?</i>

10:56.183 --> 10:57.849
- <i>Hey, Mom.</i>
- <i>Hi, Mom.</i>

10:57.851 --> 10:59.417
<i>I mean, hi, Lisette.</i>

10:59.419 --> 11:00.988
<i>Hi, Uncle Will.</i>

11:01.923 --> 11:05.391
<i>This is so cool, Annie.</i>

11:05.393 --> 11:07.727
- <i>Oh, my God!</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

11:07.729 --> 11:10.396
- <i>New haircut? Yes? Like, yeah?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

11:10.398 --> 11:13.331
<i>You're just like
Marilyn, yeah.</i>

11:13.333 --> 11:16.001
<i>I ain't a nurse no more.
Not tonight.</i>

11:16.003 --> 11:18.070
<i>I'm Marilyn Monroe.</i>

11:18.072 --> 11:19.805
<i>No scrubs here.</i>

11:19.807 --> 11:21.507
<i>Okay. You go do Marilyn.</i>

11:21.509 --> 11:23.309
- <i>I'm not going...</i>
- <i>No.</i>

11:23.311 --> 11:25.111
<i>Okay. But... Good try.</i>

11:25.113 --> 11:26.978
<i>I...</i>

11:26.980 --> 11:28.881
<i>And this is
the last address</i>

11:28.883 --> 11:31.887
<i>Annie had for
Gus and Suzanne.</i>

11:35.322 --> 11:38.025
<i>And I think
that's the landlady.</i>

11:41.863 --> 11:43.429
<i>Just stop that, okay.</i>

11:43.431 --> 11:45.864
- <i>Stop.</i>
- <i>Stop it.</i>

11:45.866 --> 11:49.234
So what did she say?
Anything?

11:49.236 --> 11:52.204
Yeah. She said she
thought Gus was an asshole.

11:52.206 --> 11:54.540
Wow!
Like, breaking news.

11:54.542 --> 11:57.209
I know, right.
God.

11:57.211 --> 11:59.445
It was just like it was
back home before she left.

11:59.447 --> 12:01.213
And I'm running around
looking for Suzanne.

12:01.215 --> 12:03.047
- Annie.
- Ugh!

12:03.049 --> 12:05.416
- Why does she keep doing this to my mother?
- I know!

12:05.418 --> 12:08.087
I know she can be a pain in the ass.
I was there.

12:08.089 --> 12:09.320
Ugh,
she makes me sick.

12:09.322 --> 12:11.089
Now let's go get
that mani-pedi.

12:11.091 --> 12:13.959
- Why does she live in this neighborhood?
- Yeah.

12:13.961 --> 12:16.427
It's so far from downtown if
you're gonna live in Toronto.

12:16.429 --> 12:18.199
- Gotta take the subway everywhere...
- Suzanne, Suzanne...

12:21.168 --> 12:22.203
Eh?

12:24.038 --> 12:26.137
Yay,
that's her sister, eh?

12:30.244 --> 12:31.379
Yeah.

12:32.547 --> 12:35.113
How is she?

12:35.115 --> 12:37.451
I don't know.
I haven't seen her in a while.

12:38.152 --> 12:39.919
Yeah, us too.

12:39.921 --> 12:41.587
Uh... A year, maybe.

12:41.589 --> 12:43.289
Well, how was she then?

12:43.291 --> 12:45.527
She was doing, uh,
the mod... Modeling.

12:47.094 --> 12:49.331
Gave Martha here
some clothes...

12:50.298 --> 12:52.131
Hey, you and your friend,

12:52.133 --> 12:55.200
you should come to our feast
tomorrow night.

12:55.202 --> 12:58.270
It's under the gardener dump
by the Don river.

12:58.272 --> 13:01.109
Can't. We're leaving
in the morning.

13:01.908 --> 13:03.408
Oh, that's too bad.

13:03.410 --> 13:06.878
We could... We could use some
more girls around the fire.

13:08.548 --> 13:10.348
We're gonna go.

13:10.350 --> 13:13.221
We have an appointment.
Annie!

13:14.388 --> 13:15.956
Eh, hogwash.

13:25.298 --> 13:27.434
Just tell me

13:29.437 --> 13:30.971
what it is you're gonna do.

13:32.273 --> 13:34.176
I'm gonna
check some things out.

13:34.942 --> 13:36.510
I thought "we" did that.

13:38.144 --> 13:41.579
<i>The rainy season begins...</i>

13:41.581 --> 13:45.084
He said they haven't seen her
in, like, a year.

13:45.086 --> 13:48.020
You told me you only brought
200 bucks with you.

13:48.022 --> 13:49.555
How long you figure
that's gonna last?

13:49.557 --> 13:51.891
So when the money runs out
I'll come home.

13:51.893 --> 13:54.196
Annie, that's just
stupid.

13:56.464 --> 13:59.000
<i>Very comfortable
in that short yardage unit.</i>

14:03.571 --> 14:05.470
<i>Giants to center.</i>

14:05.472 --> 14:06.906
<i>Jones spins and shoots.</i>

14:32.198 --> 14:33.598
Well, I'm about to now.

14:33.600 --> 14:35.169
I'll talk to you later.

14:43.576 --> 14:47.278
Wow! She had
a real career, eh?

14:47.280 --> 14:48.314
I guess.

14:48.316 --> 14:51.650
She must have been a big
deal back home, then.

14:51.652 --> 14:53.288
Let me print
one of these out.

14:54.554 --> 14:57.925
Maybe this
will be better.

14:59.493 --> 15:01.359
Oh, okay.

15:01.361 --> 15:04.363
So, when was the last time
you heard from her?

15:04.365 --> 15:06.364
Eight months ago.

15:06.366 --> 15:08.233
She didn't really
keep in touch.

15:08.235 --> 15:11.369
Sent my mother money
sometimes, or lame postcards,

15:11.371 --> 15:12.738
or just pictures of herself.

15:12.740 --> 15:14.109
Stuff like that.

15:15.308 --> 15:17.977
When she disappeared
for almost a year,

15:17.979 --> 15:20.713
things were pretty bad
between her and my mom, so...

15:20.715 --> 15:21.983
Mmm.

15:23.317 --> 15:25.651
Okay. Well, here,
have a seat.

15:25.653 --> 15:28.188
How did you find out
that she was missing?

15:29.289 --> 15:32.156
Uh, the cops came to us.

15:32.158 --> 15:34.526
They had the "Missing
Person's" report from Toronto.

15:34.528 --> 15:36.527
And when was that?

15:36.529 --> 15:37.999
Three months ago.

15:39.066 --> 15:41.432
Do you know
who filed the report?

15:41.434 --> 15:42.536
They said it was
anonymous.

15:46.374 --> 15:48.339
I think it was Gus.

15:48.341 --> 15:51.009
The boyfriend, that's who
she came down here with.

15:51.011 --> 15:52.680
And no one's
heard from him either?

15:56.683 --> 15:59.584
His cousin's a big
drug-dealer back home.

15:59.586 --> 16:02.222
There's always been bad blood
between our families.

16:04.024 --> 16:05.723
Suzanne just wanted
to get out of Moosonee.

16:05.725 --> 16:07.062
Gus was the easiest way.

16:09.029 --> 16:10.230
You all right?

16:12.298 --> 16:14.632
- Yeah.
- I'll make some calls.

16:14.634 --> 16:17.268
Find out, maybe,
if somebody's heard something,

16:17.270 --> 16:20.506
or someone knows someone, maybe.

16:20.508 --> 16:23.078
Someone knows someone
else who knows something and, uh,

16:23.744 --> 16:26.277
you can stay for lunch.

16:26.279 --> 16:29.451
There's lots of good people
here and good company.

16:34.221 --> 16:36.423
Maybe you could
just call me?

16:38.426 --> 16:39.627
Okay.

17:43.156 --> 17:45.125
Where do you get goose
around here?

17:45.859 --> 17:47.625
Ah...

17:47.627 --> 17:51.130
There's more geese here
than there is on James Bay.

17:51.132 --> 17:54.165
Lazy buggers, too.

17:54.167 --> 17:56.334
Come. Your sister?

17:56.336 --> 17:59.203
Nah. She was a waitress.

17:59.205 --> 18:02.843
And she meets this guy,
and she gets all these jobs.

18:03.477 --> 18:04.846
I got, uh...

18:05.813 --> 18:07.582
One of her, uh,

18:08.481 --> 18:10.317
modeling postcards.

18:11.719 --> 18:14.753
Yeah. A-ha.

18:14.755 --> 18:17.492
Here, you keep that.

18:19.593 --> 18:21.196
You met Gus?

18:22.163 --> 18:23.698
Oh, yes.

18:24.431 --> 18:25.866
He was always around.

18:26.767 --> 18:27.500
Big talker.

18:30.336 --> 18:32.673
Said he had, oh,
lots of business.

18:34.340 --> 18:36.777
I think he was just
spending her money.

18:38.412 --> 18:41.883
How come it took you so long
to come down to look for her?

18:43.616 --> 18:46.485
Well, we thought
someone would help.

18:46.487 --> 18:51.890
A band counselor told my mom to
hire this useless lawyer down here.

18:51.892 --> 18:54.759
Yeah, she and my mom,
they were gonna come down.

18:54.761 --> 18:57.464
As if. They've never even
been south of Cochrane.

18:58.965 --> 19:00.465
You too, huh?

19:02.970 --> 19:04.204
Well,

19:05.306 --> 19:07.375
you came down anyways,
my girl.

19:08.642 --> 19:11.613
She wasn't doing too good
even with the money.

19:14.582 --> 19:16.651
She used to dream
that she'd, uh,

19:17.617 --> 19:19.684
walk out into the lake

19:19.686 --> 19:22.456
till the water
was way above her head.

19:24.892 --> 19:26.928
Then she'd come up
for air and she was...

19:28.729 --> 19:30.465
She was...

19:31.664 --> 19:33.498
Back in Moose River.

19:35.836 --> 19:39.571
Oh, look the gosh-goddam,
Johnny Law.

19:39.573 --> 19:41.176
Here comes your boyfriend.
Wake up.

19:43.009 --> 19:44.508
Evening, Leo.

19:44.510 --> 19:46.245
Oh, we're just
having dinner.

19:46.247 --> 19:47.313
You better go.

19:47.315 --> 19:49.448
Didn't we just talk about
the whole fire thing?

19:49.450 --> 19:51.315
We were having,
uh, goose,

19:51.317 --> 19:53.684
- but we got no oven.
- Fire code, Leo.

19:53.686 --> 19:55.386
Do you want me
to charge you?

19:55.388 --> 19:56.555
If I have to I will.

19:56.557 --> 19:57.922
- Do you want a goose?
- Come on.

19:57.924 --> 19:59.560
- I'll give you the goose.
- Put it out.

20:26.819 --> 20:28.653
Whoo!

20:28.655 --> 20:30.224
Kiss you all over.

20:52.880 --> 20:54.882
You're going
the wrong way.

20:55.481 --> 20:56.683
Go that way.

21:01.555 --> 21:02.923
I need money.

21:25.112 --> 21:27.946
<i>No, I'm just gonna
check out a few things</i>

21:27.948 --> 21:29.717
and then I'll
be home, okay?

21:31.751 --> 21:32.787
Mom?

21:34.954 --> 21:36.624
So then tell me
you won't worry.

21:40.626 --> 21:42.829
I'll call you
in a few days, okay?

21:44.865 --> 21:46.668
I love you, Mom.

21:49.470 --> 21:50.971
Did you hear me?

21:54.040 --> 21:55.907
Yeah, okay.

21:55.909 --> 21:57.478
Okay, bye.

22:13.460 --> 22:15.596
You have
Annie Bird here to see you.

22:18.097 --> 22:19.334
Yeah.

22:20.901 --> 22:22.470
Okay.

22:24.837 --> 22:25.906
He'll just be a moment.

22:51.064 --> 22:52.367
Annie?

22:56.737 --> 22:58.639
Um... Come on.

23:03.644 --> 23:04.746
Come on in.

23:05.846 --> 23:07.048
No calls.

23:08.615 --> 23:10.681
<i>She started
to get a reputation.</i>

23:10.683 --> 23:13.919
Showing up late,
not showing up at all.

23:13.921 --> 23:17.091
She turned up at one shoot
with a black eye.

23:18.192 --> 23:19.857
I talked to her
about moving out,

23:19.859 --> 23:21.826
getting some help,
but she wouldn't leave him

23:21.828 --> 23:24.028
and she couldn't focus
on her work.

23:24.030 --> 23:25.732
People stopped booking her,
I had to let her go.

23:27.233 --> 23:29.100
Just so you know,

23:29.102 --> 23:30.405
I told all this
to the police.

23:31.704 --> 23:34.008
But you didn't file
the missing person's report?

23:34.607 --> 23:35.806
Me? No.

23:35.808 --> 23:37.677
I just figured
she'd gone off with him.

23:39.112 --> 23:41.680
My mother's lawyer
ever contact you?

23:41.682 --> 23:42.680
Mmm, no...

23:42.682 --> 23:46.817
Look, we don't have to get
lawyers involved.

23:46.819 --> 23:49.621
The only money that I owe her
was from the very last job.

23:49.623 --> 23:50.988
And we tried.

23:50.990 --> 23:53.757
We called a few times,
but she wasn't picking up her messages.

23:53.759 --> 23:55.093
I... I...

23:55.095 --> 23:56.995
Just... I... I...
I think that I...

23:56.997 --> 23:58.729
I'm not allowed
to give it to you

23:58.731 --> 24:00.498
unless you have
a death certificate or...

24:00.500 --> 24:02.867
- My sister's not dead.
- I'm not saying that she is.

24:02.869 --> 24:04.037
Jesus!

24:04.671 --> 24:06.770
I'm saying that

24:06.772 --> 24:08.606
I don't think I can just...

24:08.608 --> 24:10.141
Why don't you just
give me the number

24:10.143 --> 24:11.778
of the last person
she worked for.

24:14.013 --> 24:15.814
Uh...

24:15.816 --> 24:16.951
Sure.

24:17.784 --> 24:18.986
Uh...

24:20.854 --> 24:22.657
He's a photographer.

24:26.026 --> 24:28.930
He kept booking her
when nobody else would.

24:30.631 --> 24:32.733
And I gave all this
to the cops, too.

24:42.675 --> 24:45.011
Your sister
could have been massive.

24:46.846 --> 24:48.849
She had exactly the look
people want right now.

24:49.549 --> 24:50.784
It's a damn shame.

24:51.785 --> 24:52.987
Thanks.

24:54.654 --> 24:56.153
Hold on, hold on, wait.

24:56.155 --> 24:57.557
Wait.

25:05.965 --> 25:10.035
Your sister would come
and collect her pay in person.

25:10.037 --> 25:11.271
She liked cash.

25:12.873 --> 25:14.275
I want to help you
find her.

25:38.265 --> 25:40.966
- All right.
- Hey, no guns inside...

25:40.968 --> 25:42.670
Yeah. Just shopping.

25:43.769 --> 25:44.771
Good night.

26:30.717 --> 26:32.086
Fucking drunk!

27:16.163 --> 27:17.429
So what have we got here?

27:17.431 --> 27:19.730
So, still talking
to the cops, huh?

27:21.334 --> 27:23.804
He said, "Hey,"
I said, "Hey."

27:27.074 --> 27:28.808
Marius warned you, man.

27:31.377 --> 27:32.744
What exactly
do you guys want?

27:32.746 --> 27:34.912
We don't want no rats
on our bridge.

27:34.914 --> 27:37.815
You used to play with
my niece, Suzanne, you?

27:37.817 --> 27:40.117
Like eight
or nine years old.

27:40.119 --> 27:41.888
Why isn't Annie back
from Toronto?

27:53.799 --> 27:55.735
This here is
my grandfather's gun.

27:57.304 --> 27:58.673
From the first war.

27:59.472 --> 28:01.174
Killed a lot of men,
this gun.

28:02.308 --> 28:03.911
That's what it was made for.

28:09.750 --> 28:10.884
Go on home.

28:14.153 --> 28:15.455
I said get.

28:24.131 --> 28:25.298
Piece of shit.

28:27.400 --> 28:28.836
Maybe not.

28:32.905 --> 28:35.373
<i>Okay, so now you're
Clint fucking Eastwood.</i>

28:35.375 --> 28:37.275
Life three crashes me.

28:37.277 --> 28:39.177
Came up better
than my plane did.

28:39.179 --> 28:40.911
- <i>Yup.</i>
- Can't kill me, motherfucker.

28:40.913 --> 28:42.780
- <i>Uh-huh.</i>
- Remember, one.

28:42.782 --> 28:44.481
Atawapiskat,
remember that one?

28:44.483 --> 28:45.984
<i>Right between
two trees.</i>

28:45.986 --> 28:48.119
Right between two trees,
took the wings right off.

28:48.121 --> 28:50.154
Still got my arms.
Two.

28:50.156 --> 28:51.922
That minister over there
in Mistissini

28:51.924 --> 28:54.225
- wanted me to carry that load of bibles in.
- <i>Yup.</i>

28:54.227 --> 28:56.094
What the fuck are those
things made of, man?

28:56.096 --> 28:57.461
- Iron wood?
- <i>Iron. I don't know.</i>

28:57.463 --> 28:58.832
And three...

28:59.833 --> 29:01.466
Where the fuck...

29:01.468 --> 29:03.500
Can't kill me,
motherfucker.

29:03.502 --> 29:06.504
<i>Can't fucking
kill you, huh?</i>

29:06.506 --> 29:08.972
<i>Hey, good for you.
You think Marius gives a fuck?</i>

29:08.974 --> 29:10.310
Oh, he'll give a fuck.

29:11.577 --> 29:13.844
Best hunter
in James Bay, me.

29:13.846 --> 29:15.046
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah,
we know.</i>

29:15.048 --> 29:17.114
<i>Hey, listen, bro,
you gotta go to the cops.</i>

29:17.116 --> 29:18.449
Yeah, right.

29:18.451 --> 29:20.051
<i>You said already,
he thinks you're a snitch.</i>

29:20.053 --> 29:21.553
Because he's
fucking mental.

29:21.555 --> 29:23.555
<i>So he's mental.
You're gonna wait for him to kill you?</i>

29:23.557 --> 29:24.489
Fuck!

29:24.491 --> 29:27.324
<i>Come on,
bro, I'm telling you.</i>

29:27.326 --> 29:29.326
<i>This isn't my first fucking rodeo.</i>

29:29.328 --> 29:31.496
- <i>You gotta go to the cops.</i>
- Shut up.

29:31.498 --> 29:33.931
<i>Fucking bullshit,
"Shut up"?</i>

29:33.933 --> 29:35.165
<i>Who the hell
do you think you are?</i>

29:35.167 --> 29:36.402
<i>Fucking, Billy Jack?</i>

29:38.070 --> 29:39.970
<i>Hey, bro,
listen to me.</i>

29:39.972 --> 29:41.573
<i>I know what
I'm talking about here.</i>

29:41.575 --> 29:43.274
<i>You gotta go
to the cops.</i>

29:43.276 --> 29:44.875
<i>That's the only way
it is.</i>

29:44.877 --> 29:46.376
<i>Do you hear
what I'm saying?</i>

30:08.167 --> 30:09.334
<i>Hey, bro.</i>

30:09.336 --> 30:11.401
<i>What the fuck, bro?
What the fuck happened?</i>

30:11.403 --> 30:13.872
An old friend just
stopped by for dinner.

30:13.874 --> 30:15.440
- <i>Old friend?</i>
- Talk to you later.

30:15.442 --> 30:16.477
<i>What!</i>

30:59.051 --> 31:00.486
Sister.

31:02.555 --> 31:03.958
Enjoy.

32:31.044 --> 32:33.777
I know it was him
or one of his guys.

32:33.779 --> 32:36.546
But you didn't
actually see anybody?

32:36.548 --> 32:38.519
- I saw a truck.
- Marius'?

32:40.220 --> 32:41.686
It was too dark.

32:41.688 --> 32:43.290
Any damage inside?

32:44.023 --> 32:45.489
The window.

32:45.491 --> 32:46.961
Let's check it out.

32:49.128 --> 32:50.263
Lisette.

32:57.202 --> 32:58.702
Will, this, uh,
the truck.

32:58.704 --> 33:00.438
Any chance you got
a plate number?

33:00.440 --> 33:02.308
- No.
- Mmm.

33:06.679 --> 33:09.383
How much you figure you had
to drink this evening, buddy?

33:10.383 --> 33:12.682
Jesus, George.

33:12.684 --> 33:16.222
Marius Nutmaker
just fire-bombed my house!

33:17.490 --> 33:18.523
Because?

33:18.525 --> 33:21.261
He thinks I'm snitching
on him to you guys.

33:21.827 --> 33:23.129
Mmm.

33:26.298 --> 33:29.566
All right, I'm gonna
write this up.

33:29.568 --> 33:32.469
Probably a good idea if you just
spent the night with Lisette.

33:32.471 --> 33:34.505
He needs protection.

33:34.507 --> 33:35.840
It's not real practical.

33:35.842 --> 33:37.674
Just get him out of here
for the evening,

33:37.676 --> 33:38.742
he should be fine.

33:38.744 --> 33:40.378
He needs protection!

33:40.380 --> 33:42.049
- He's not safe!
- Stop it, please.

33:43.148 --> 33:44.350
God!

33:45.518 --> 33:47.453
Okay, I'm...
I'm gonna go now.

33:49.288 --> 33:50.456
You watch yourself, Will.

34:04.369 --> 34:05.805
Do you think
you can sleep?

34:08.440 --> 34:11.045
Maybe try taking one of them
pills the doctor gave you.

34:15.849 --> 34:17.451
I'm the snitch.

34:21.652 --> 34:23.257
What?

34:25.257 --> 34:26.592
What are you
talking about?

34:29.628 --> 34:31.731
I'm the snitch.
I told the cops about Marius.

34:34.733 --> 34:35.835
What'd you tell 'em?

34:37.137 --> 34:38.705
About his whole setup.

34:41.672 --> 34:45.443
How the hell would you know
about Marius' setup?

34:45.445 --> 34:47.347
Suzanne knew.
I found her journal.

34:48.614 --> 34:49.849
When did this happen?

34:51.317 --> 34:52.516
They called me.

34:52.518 --> 34:53.717
- Lis, when...
- They called me...

34:53.719 --> 34:55.286
They called me
back to the station

34:55.288 --> 34:56.686
a couple of days
after they told us

34:56.688 --> 34:58.722
about the
missing person's report.

34:58.724 --> 35:00.493
There was a bunch
of them there.

35:01.360 --> 35:02.496
Who?

35:03.730 --> 35:05.365
Cops. I don't know.

35:06.231 --> 35:08.266
That shit, George,

35:08.268 --> 35:10.200
some guys
I've never seen before.

35:10.202 --> 35:12.537
And they said that they
could find Suzanne faster

35:12.539 --> 35:14.408
if they knew what Marius
and Gus were doing.

35:16.208 --> 35:18.543
But the stuff

35:18.545 --> 35:22.246
that she wrote in there
was too old.

35:22.248 --> 35:24.182
But there was
names in there,

35:24.184 --> 35:26.816
and there was places where
she would go with Gus

35:26.818 --> 35:28.489
to pick up stuff.

35:52.579 --> 35:54.715
I did it for my baby.

35:56.349 --> 35:57.551
She's a good girl.

35:59.351 --> 36:01.619
She's a good girl, Will.

36:01.621 --> 36:03.653
And everything that
happened to her

36:03.655 --> 36:05.759
and went wrong with her
is because of me.

36:07.393 --> 36:08.661
It's my fault.

36:10.362 --> 36:11.831
It's my fault!

36:13.498 --> 36:15.234
Oh, my God!

36:22.875 --> 36:24.641
Remember
when they were small

36:24.643 --> 36:27.244
and nobody
could tell them apart,

36:27.246 --> 36:28.514
except you and me?

36:32.318 --> 36:33.320
Shh.

36:34.320 --> 36:36.490
- I need my girls.
- I know. Hey...

36:38.458 --> 36:40.260
Close your eyes now.

39:40.072 --> 39:41.708
Please lock the door.

39:45.143 --> 39:46.812
Tell your sister
I say hi.

41:40.126 --> 41:41.561
Breathe in.

41:43.094 --> 41:44.263
Stop your heart.

41:47.967 --> 41:49.099
Let go.

43:30.235 --> 43:34.373
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, may I have
your attention for just a few minutes?</i>

43:35.041 --> 43:36.074
Welcome.

43:36.076 --> 43:39.075
Thank you so much
for coming out this evening.

43:39.077 --> 43:43.083
Um, I just want to say a few
words about these amazing images.

43:44.150 --> 43:45.816
As you can see,

43:45.818 --> 43:48.251
they're classical,
timeless,

43:48.253 --> 43:50.720
totally of the moment,

43:50.722 --> 43:52.956
and, yes, they're universal.

43:52.958 --> 43:54.758
Woman as muse,

43:54.760 --> 43:57.061
woman as victim.

43:57.063 --> 43:59.162
Now these are pictures
of an indigenous woman,

43:59.164 --> 44:02.066
with all her
cultural specificity.

44:02.068 --> 44:06.336
She represents the faceless,
the abused,

44:06.338 --> 44:09.773
missing, murdered.

44:09.775 --> 44:14.445
The subject's body now used to carry a
message back to the dominant culture.

44:14.447 --> 44:16.914
A message which is
even more powerful now

44:16.916 --> 44:19.215
that the model herself
has gone missing.

44:19.217 --> 44:23.753
It's a haunting and angry,
very brave statement

44:23.755 --> 44:25.755
by a first nation's artist.

44:25.757 --> 44:30.494
A man who has left behind a very
lucrative world of fashion photography

44:30.496 --> 44:32.795
to do something which,
in his words,

44:32.797 --> 44:34.164
finally matters.

44:34.166 --> 44:36.333
He has requested
that the proceeds

44:36.335 --> 44:38.735
from the sales of this series
be donated

44:38.737 --> 44:40.070
to the family fund

44:40.072 --> 44:42.175
for missing and murdered
indigenous women and girls.

44:45.143 --> 44:49.246
And the Seis McConnell Gallery will
be donating our commissions as well.

44:50.449 --> 44:54.383
I am so proud to be hosting
his very first one-man show.

44:54.385 --> 44:56.019
Ladies and gentlemen,

44:56.021 --> 44:57.057
Jesse Butterfoot.

45:01.427 --> 45:03.195
Thank you, Cynthia.

45:03.862 --> 45:05.496
Uh, the support,

45:05.498 --> 45:07.396
and the chance to actually
show my work here,

45:07.398 --> 45:08.831
it means a lot.

45:08.833 --> 45:11.467
And there's not much else I can
add that you haven't said already.

45:11.469 --> 45:12.903
Thank you.

45:22.181 --> 45:23.780
Don't worry about it.

45:23.782 --> 45:24.784
It's open bar.

45:25.451 --> 45:26.952
Annie.

45:27.952 --> 45:29.155
Hi.

45:29.554 --> 45:31.054
Hi.

45:31.056 --> 45:32.389
I'm glad you came.

45:32.391 --> 45:35.124
- I was worried that maybe it would be upsetting for you.
- No.

45:35.126 --> 45:38.195
Hi. Uh, excuse me.
Nate Berger from <i>Now.</i>

45:38.197 --> 45:40.429
Can I just steal you
for five minutes?

45:40.431 --> 45:42.432
- Just give me a minute.
- Okay.

45:42.434 --> 45:44.434
Hey, I found
Geeta's number.

45:44.436 --> 45:47.037
That model that Suzanne
was living with?

45:47.039 --> 45:49.572
- Great.
- It was in my other contact list.

45:49.574 --> 45:52.008
Got you in here somewhere,
so, uh...

45:52.010 --> 45:53.142
Thanks.

45:53.144 --> 45:55.144
Well, uh, gotta talk
to this guy.

45:55.146 --> 45:57.014
Mix with the clients.

45:57.016 --> 45:58.447
You're here for
a couple of days, right?

45:58.449 --> 45:59.752
Yeah, I think so.

46:01.519 --> 46:02.920
Well,

46:02.922 --> 46:03.987
why don't you come by
the studio?

46:03.989 --> 46:05.289
We can talk some more.

46:05.291 --> 46:06.526
Sure.

46:08.893 --> 46:10.096
Glad you found me.

46:13.865 --> 46:15.199
Hey, sorry,
sorry to interrupt.

46:15.201 --> 46:17.166
Uh, do you mind
if I record you?

46:17.168 --> 46:18.901
I love, love,
love the show

46:18.903 --> 46:23.139
and I want to get this
filed before my deadline.

46:23.141 --> 46:24.977
Okay, just a couple
of questions.

46:41.293 --> 46:42.796
Oh, my God.

46:45.264 --> 46:46.466
Hi.

46:47.298 --> 46:48.501
My God.

46:49.934 --> 46:51.601
I feel like I'm looking
at Suzanne.

46:51.603 --> 46:53.906
Oh. Yeah.

46:58.244 --> 47:00.142
Sorry. I'm just not around
enough to finish it.

47:00.144 --> 47:03.347
Last year, I was actually going
to take down this entire wall,

47:03.349 --> 47:05.514
make it all one room.

47:05.516 --> 47:08.517
Then I got booked in Paris and
I was just like, "Oh, whatever.

47:08.519 --> 47:10.586
"I'll do it whenever
I'm supposed to do it."

47:10.588 --> 47:12.623
Do you want some,
like, tea or something?

47:12.625 --> 47:14.090
Oh, yeah.

47:14.092 --> 47:15.494
That would be great.

47:17.161 --> 47:18.628
You, um...

47:18.630 --> 47:21.030
- You went to the show?
- Mmm-hmm

47:21.032 --> 47:22.467
It was so beautiful.

47:24.202 --> 47:25.401
I mean, like, so what

47:25.403 --> 47:27.037
if she couldn't book
a fucking catalogue job.

47:27.039 --> 47:28.608
She was making art.
She was really happy.

47:31.143 --> 47:32.642
Was Gus still around?

47:32.644 --> 47:33.943
No.

47:33.945 --> 47:35.912
God, no.
She broke up with him

47:35.914 --> 47:37.179
when her agent
dropped her.

47:37.181 --> 47:38.548
That's when I got her
to move in here,

47:38.550 --> 47:39.516
and then she met Jesse,

47:39.518 --> 47:41.684
and she really got into
what they were doing

47:41.686 --> 47:43.956
and she stopped, finally,
obsessing over Gus.

47:45.356 --> 47:47.624
- Was Jesse paying her?
- Yeah.

47:47.626 --> 47:49.159
Not like what
she used to earn,

47:49.161 --> 47:51.394
but it was enough
to make a living off of.

47:51.396 --> 47:53.996
She was just, like,
really shit with money.

47:55.134 --> 47:57.034
- Was she always like that?
- Mmm-hmm.

47:57.036 --> 47:59.038
God. She smoked
so much weed.

48:00.239 --> 48:02.342
And Gus wasn't around
to supply her anymore.

48:03.641 --> 48:06.476
She owed me, like,
three months rent.

48:06.478 --> 48:08.244
But it was fine, like,
whatever, like,

48:08.246 --> 48:12.014
I was just happy to have
someone living here, you know,

48:12.016 --> 48:14.086
'cause I was just
away so much.

48:16.088 --> 48:18.458
But it was just always
about the money with her.

48:20.025 --> 48:21.458
And then Gus shows up.

48:21.460 --> 48:23.726
And he's, like, obviously,
throwing it at her.

48:23.728 --> 48:25.394
Like, "Hey, baby,
I'm gonna take care of you,"

48:25.396 --> 48:26.796
and all that shit.

48:26.798 --> 48:30.133
He was so nasty that I didn't even
want him in the fucking house.

48:30.135 --> 48:32.501
And then I went away for,
like, two months on a shoot,

48:32.503 --> 48:34.170
and I came back,

48:34.172 --> 48:35.607
and she was gone.

48:37.108 --> 48:38.742
What the fuck?
Like, I didn't even know,

48:38.744 --> 48:40.376
she didn't take anything
with her.

48:40.378 --> 48:43.213
And, like,
I called her phone so many times,

48:43.215 --> 48:44.648
her voicemail was full.

48:44.650 --> 48:46.148
I'm calling Jesse.

48:46.150 --> 48:47.351
And then the police show up

48:47.353 --> 48:49.021
and there is a
missing person's report.

48:50.556 --> 48:52.157
I'm just so sorry.

48:54.460 --> 48:56.996
I just left it
how it was.

48:57.730 --> 48:59.032
Oh.

49:01.567 --> 49:02.999
Take it.

49:03.001 --> 49:04.501
- Take all of it.
- No.

49:04.503 --> 49:06.372
She might
come back for it.

49:10.675 --> 49:12.411
You should take the room.

49:13.612 --> 49:15.144
- Really?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

49:15.146 --> 49:16.382
I'd love it
if you stayed.

49:17.548 --> 49:19.249
Okay.

49:19.251 --> 49:20.653
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

49:24.356 --> 49:25.658
Size zero.

49:26.557 --> 49:27.657
Some of it can fit you.

49:27.659 --> 49:28.961
As if.

49:31.195 --> 49:33.333
She used to wear
the same jeans for weeks.

51:36.420 --> 51:37.554
<i>Yeah?</i>

51:37.556 --> 51:38.889
Uh, it's Annie.

51:38.891 --> 51:40.423
<i>Uh, hey, Annie,
come on up.</i>

51:40.425 --> 51:41.561
<i>It's, uh, third floor.</i>

51:46.731 --> 51:48.365
Hi.

51:48.367 --> 51:49.535
Just a sec.

51:50.802 --> 51:52.238
I'm here to see Jesse.

51:58.309 --> 51:59.578
Hey, come on in.

52:00.711 --> 52:01.912
Are you good?

52:01.914 --> 52:03.213
Mmm-hmm.

52:03.215 --> 52:04.380
You want some tea?

52:04.382 --> 52:05.518
Sure.

52:07.219 --> 52:09.385
Still do that
fashion stuff, huh?

52:09.387 --> 52:10.822
A little, pays the bills.

52:14.659 --> 52:17.726
I saw this before
at her agency.

52:17.728 --> 52:19.364
I met her
on that shoot.

52:20.565 --> 52:21.932
That's my moshum's hat.

52:21.934 --> 52:23.503
He gave it to her
when we were little.

52:24.402 --> 52:25.834
She shouldn't have
done that.

52:25.836 --> 52:28.804
They went ape shit
for that campaign in Milan.

52:28.806 --> 52:31.775
Designer said she looked
Indian but not too Indian.

52:31.777 --> 52:33.545
They tend to be assholes.

52:35.813 --> 52:37.315
Syllabics?

52:37.983 --> 52:39.782
That was her.

52:39.784 --> 52:42.355
From some book she remembered
from grade school.

52:42.753 --> 52:44.220
<i>Take Me Home.</i>

52:44.222 --> 52:45.824
Yeah, we used
to love that book.

52:46.925 --> 52:48.925
She can't write Cree.

52:48.927 --> 52:50.894
She can't even speak it.

52:50.896 --> 52:52.494
Well, that
she remembered.

52:52.496 --> 52:53.899
It worked great
for the image.

52:57.501 --> 52:59.536
Sorry, uh...

52:59.538 --> 53:01.806
It's so weird you guys look
a lot alike.

53:02.740 --> 53:04.407
She said that, but...

53:04.409 --> 53:05.878
Actually seeing it...

53:07.378 --> 53:08.813
Why don't you
put your bag down.

53:13.485 --> 53:14.851
Who's this?

53:14.853 --> 53:16.255
My mum.

53:17.556 --> 53:18.921
Where is she from?

53:18.923 --> 53:21.258
Akwesasne.

53:21.260 --> 53:22.958
She was adopted
when she was two.

53:22.960 --> 53:24.526
Married a white guy
from Windsor.

53:24.528 --> 53:27.296
That was the first portrait
that I shot.

53:27.298 --> 53:29.298
Uh, it could have been
a lot better,

53:29.300 --> 53:31.304
but she never sat
for me again.

53:31.802 --> 53:33.302
Did she die?

53:33.304 --> 53:34.639
When I was 16.

53:37.976 --> 53:39.378
Tea.

53:54.492 --> 53:56.461
Feels like you still
have stuff to ask me.

54:01.300 --> 54:02.898
You think Gus hurt her,

54:02.900 --> 54:04.469
like, really hurt her?

54:09.574 --> 54:11.541
I don't know.

54:11.543 --> 54:13.610
But she said that
he was in town

54:13.612 --> 54:15.878
just to funnel meth
back to his cousin.

54:15.880 --> 54:17.750
I guess.
She never said.

54:18.849 --> 54:20.983
And then he started
selling on his own.

54:20.985 --> 54:22.818
Gus was selling meth
in Toronto?

54:22.820 --> 54:25.391
Meth, fentanyl,
heroin.

54:26.824 --> 54:28.557
I think that's when
he turned up again.

54:28.559 --> 54:30.427
And, uh,

54:30.429 --> 54:31.994
she just couldn't
let it go.

54:31.996 --> 54:34.030
But I want you to know that
your sister was the reason...

54:34.032 --> 54:35.701
Don't keep saying "was."

54:37.436 --> 54:39.802
Your sister is the reason
I could do this show.

54:39.804 --> 54:41.373
She's my mother
all over again.

54:42.574 --> 54:44.010
The show's
about your mother?

54:44.842 --> 54:46.045
And Suzanne.

54:47.713 --> 54:49.615
It's about a woman who isn't
where she's supposed to be.

54:51.717 --> 54:52.952
She can't
get back there.

54:54.385 --> 54:57.354
Suzanne could get back
if she had the money.

54:57.356 --> 54:59.292
She could just
get on a plane.

55:01.793 --> 55:03.028
I should go.

55:03.762 --> 55:04.897
Oh.

55:05.731 --> 55:07.130
So what are you thinking?

55:07.132 --> 55:08.701
Uh, you gonna
stick around for a bit?

55:09.568 --> 55:11.066
I don't know.

55:11.068 --> 55:13.739
Well, if you do,
lemme know.

55:16.907 --> 55:18.310
Thanks.

55:31.021 --> 55:32.791
It's too small.

55:34.793 --> 55:37.092
Oh, my God, stop.
You look fucking amazing.

55:37.094 --> 55:40.432
No, you can fit into half of her stuff.
Let me just... Give me one sec.

55:44.668 --> 55:47.405
Here, hold still.
Got it.

55:50.442 --> 55:52.008
Don't do that.

55:52.010 --> 55:55.979
Okay, I know. But I really want you to
have a good time tonight and just relax.

55:55.981 --> 55:57.847
Thanks, but...

55:57.849 --> 56:01.418
Okay, I'll leave it here for you
in case you change your mind and...

56:01.420 --> 56:04.586
Do not take off that dress,
you look amazing.

56:04.588 --> 56:07.023
I can't wait for you
to meet Victor and Violet.

56:07.025 --> 56:08.961
We're gonna go get some
food, I hope you're hungry.

56:11.829 --> 56:16.633
Violet is gonna die when she sees you.
She's gonna freak out.

56:16.635 --> 56:18.871
I think everyone's gonna
freak out when they see you.

56:19.603 --> 56:20.936
Oh, and I...

56:20.938 --> 56:23.807
I talked to Jesse.
He said he might stop by, so...

56:23.809 --> 56:25.675
That'll be interesting.

56:39.791 --> 56:41.523
Hi.

56:55.072 --> 56:57.206
- Come on, babe. Hurry up.
- Just a second.

56:57.208 --> 56:59.541
- There she is.
- Finally.

56:59.543 --> 57:02.080
- You better be ready...
- Come on, the drinks are not gonna drink themselves, girl.

57:04.882 --> 57:07.217
- You gotta pushover.
- Come on.

57:23.735 --> 57:26.135
Hi! Oh, my gosh, you look
so great.

57:26.137 --> 57:28.170
You'll never guess
who I brought.

57:28.172 --> 57:31.173
Come here. I wanna introduce you
to some of Suzanne's friends.

57:31.175 --> 57:32.710
Suzanne's sister!

57:34.579 --> 57:35.677
Annie!

57:35.679 --> 57:38.081
Hi Ladies.
Guess who's here.

57:38.083 --> 57:41.517
- Annie Bird, Suzanne's sister.
- My God!

57:44.989 --> 57:49.825
This is Danny.
He got Suzanne started with the agent.

57:49.827 --> 57:52.662
- Oh.
- Hey, Annie!

57:52.664 --> 57:54.264
They love you.

57:54.266 --> 57:57.599
How's it goin'? I guess you guys haven't
heard anything new about Suzanne, huh?

57:57.601 --> 58:01.104
- Have you talked to her?
- Suzanne? No, no, no!

58:01.106 --> 58:03.273
No.

58:03.275 --> 58:05.307
It's like she came
back from the dead!

58:05.309 --> 58:07.976
Okay, because I totally
know what you're going through.

58:07.978 --> 58:11.780
I once had a cousin that killed himself.
It was awful.

58:11.782 --> 58:14.650
- I totally get it.
- Yeah.

58:14.652 --> 58:17.320
So you just came down
to feel things out for yourself?

58:17.322 --> 58:20.789
No, I came down here because my
sister is a fucking pain in the ass.

58:20.791 --> 58:22.592
I've had to look after her
my whole fucking life,

58:22.594 --> 58:24.797
and I want her to
fucking answer for it.

58:32.570 --> 58:34.704
That's funny.

58:34.706 --> 58:38.708
So, um, how long are you
in town for?

58:38.710 --> 58:42.945
- I don't know.
- Do me a favor, if you need anything,

58:42.947 --> 58:45.682
anything at all, just get
my number from Geeta, okay?

58:45.684 --> 58:46.782
Okay.

58:46.784 --> 58:52.255
And if you do hear anything
about Suzanne... Annie?

58:52.257 --> 58:54.157
Promise me,
you'll let me know?

58:54.159 --> 58:58.161
Yeah! No, I will
definitely get in touch.

58:58.163 --> 59:02.197
Cool. Thank you!
I'm just worried, you know.

59:02.199 --> 59:03.999
Hey!
It's now or never.

59:04.001 --> 59:06.168
Oh, wow,
look who decided to show up.

59:06.170 --> 59:09.639
Actually, I'm just leaving.
She wanted to dance.

59:09.641 --> 59:10.442
What?

59:11.775 --> 59:13.876
- Have fun.
- Good to meet you, Annie.

59:24.322 --> 59:26.155
Are you okay?

59:26.157 --> 59:28.992
Yeah, yeah!

59:28.994 --> 59:34.099
You know humans are mostly made of
water, that's why I live near a river.

59:35.166 --> 59:38.101
Yeah, I'll remember that.
Um...

59:38.103 --> 59:42.170
Do me a favor.
Stay away from that dickhead.

59:42.172 --> 59:43.841
I like his shirt.

59:44.242 --> 59:46.108
He's a dealer.

59:46.110 --> 59:48.744
Annie. He's one of
Gus's connections.

59:48.746 --> 59:52.648
No, she said that's how
Suzanne got her agent.

59:52.650 --> 59:54.784
How do you think
she met him?

59:54.786 --> 59:56.355
Dealers and models,
you know...

01:00:00.157 --> 01:00:03.027
Hey! Don't even go there.

01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:28.886
- You're home safe and sound.
- That's it?

01:00:31.088 --> 01:00:34.157
I just want ice cream.
I do.

01:00:34.159 --> 01:00:37.028
I think you should go to
bed, immediately.

01:00:38.996 --> 01:00:40.898
Okay... Fine.

01:00:42.166 --> 01:00:44.702
Just wondered what
a fake Indian felt like.

01:00:47.706 --> 01:00:49.974
I think you're just
gonna have to keep wondering.

01:01:01.052 --> 01:01:05.021
Hey, I'm sending you my
address, it's right off Dundas.

01:01:05.023 --> 01:01:06.421
No problem.

01:01:11.228 --> 01:01:12.394
Did you get it?

01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:17.802
I have no keys.

01:01:19.838 --> 01:01:21.306
All right, get in.

01:01:22.806 --> 01:01:23.975
Come on.

01:01:26.143 --> 01:01:28.179
It's hot, be careful.

01:01:28.913 --> 01:01:30.479
I'm fine now.

01:01:30.481 --> 01:01:33.316
You should drink it, it's good. It'll
knock out whatever is left of that shit.

01:01:33.318 --> 01:01:35.988
- I don't do drugs.
- It's a good thing, too.

01:01:42.994 --> 01:01:44.797
Annie, what're you doing?

01:01:52.836 --> 01:01:56.340
If you're stoned,
you don't wanna do this.

01:02:03.148 --> 01:02:05.514
Fuck you.

01:02:05.516 --> 01:02:07.416
Fine, I think it's time
for you to go home.

01:02:07.418 --> 01:02:09.519
- Home?
- To Moosonee.

01:02:09.521 --> 01:02:11.521
What do you know?

01:02:11.523 --> 01:02:14.358
The asshole of the Arctic.
That's what Suzanne called it.

01:02:16.494 --> 01:02:20.929
- She hated it, you knew that.
- No, I didn't know that.

01:02:20.931 --> 01:02:23.034
All she talked about was
how much she missed it.

01:02:25.469 --> 01:02:30.039
She tried to hitchhike out
when she was 13.

01:02:30.041 --> 01:02:34.242
Do you know how hard that is?
You can't even do that, until it's winter.

01:02:34.244 --> 01:02:39.081
Or I'd catch her huffing,
or with her legs around some guy.

01:02:39.083 --> 01:02:43.385
Or as she'd say, "Every fucking day
in this place is exactly the same."

01:02:43.387 --> 01:02:47.358
- Is it?
- It's whatever you make it. She made it shit.

01:02:50.094 --> 01:02:52.894
Everyone loves Suzanne.

01:02:52.896 --> 01:02:55.032
My mom, my uncle.
Look at you.

01:02:55.934 --> 01:02:57.833
Your sister
had her issues.

01:02:57.835 --> 01:02:59.036
Issues?

01:02:59.971 --> 01:03:01.871
She was trying, Annie.

01:03:01.873 --> 01:03:03.809
Yeah, she was
messed up, but...

01:03:05.076 --> 01:03:07.146
She told me
about your family.

01:03:10.514 --> 01:03:12.981
She did, eh?

01:03:12.983 --> 01:03:17.019
About the shit with your
grandparents and residential schools.

01:03:17.021 --> 01:03:19.057
And how it screwed up
your mom and your uncle.

01:03:20.257 --> 01:03:23.291
- You and her.
- Me and her?

01:03:23.293 --> 01:03:26.028
The fuck do you know
about me and her?

01:03:26.030 --> 01:03:29.331
- I just meant that you came out strong.
- Aren't I lucky?

01:03:29.333 --> 01:03:32.133
I don't need you
to feel sorry for me.

01:03:32.135 --> 01:03:35.273
It's not what I feel.
It's not what I feel.

01:03:45.115 --> 01:03:47.286
I'm sorry about
the fake Indian thing.

01:03:48.085 --> 01:03:49.420
No, you're not.

01:04:34.932 --> 01:04:37.869
These moccasins,
my mum made these.

01:04:40.371 --> 01:04:41.974
Uh, yeah!

01:04:42.539 --> 01:04:45.409
Um, you can have 'em.

01:04:48.278 --> 01:04:50.282
Ever weird, you.

01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:57.720
So I said, like, I'm gonna be
your poster girl for diversity?

01:04:57.722 --> 01:05:00.356
You hire, like one South Asian
model every five years.

01:05:00.358 --> 01:05:01.423
Definitely not.

01:05:01.425 --> 01:05:02.525
- No.
- Really?

01:05:02.527 --> 01:05:03.760
Try another one.

01:05:03.762 --> 01:05:06.362
They want like a fucking
Nobel Peace Prize for it.

01:05:06.364 --> 01:05:08.630
I said to Karen,
like, forget it.

01:05:08.632 --> 01:05:10.465
No, don't, don't.

01:05:10.467 --> 01:05:13.202
I said to Karen, forget it.
She shouldn't hire any other models,

01:05:13.204 --> 01:05:15.374
she should totally tell
those dickheads why.

01:05:16.206 --> 01:05:19.075
Hey, it's from your mom.

01:05:19.077 --> 01:05:22.514
Oh, my God, Annie, your mom
got a postcard from Suzanne.

01:05:23.715 --> 01:05:26.148
Oh.

01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:28.552
- Huh!
- Well, where is she? Is she okay?

01:05:29.253 --> 01:05:30.689
She didn't say.

01:05:34.726 --> 01:05:36.161
That's so amazing.

01:07:59.903 --> 01:08:01.106
Fuck off!

01:08:15.219 --> 01:08:16.287
God!

01:13:37.875 --> 01:13:39.644
I might spend the winter
and trap.

01:13:58.996 --> 01:14:03.667
- Any news from the mainland? No radio, me.
- Me neither.

01:14:04.969 --> 01:14:08.873
This won't stop.
I think you should stay the night.

01:14:53.016 --> 01:14:54.551
Make a good team us.

01:15:45.301 --> 01:15:46.103
It's my own fault.

01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:51.776
There's a woman
up in your community.

01:15:52.943 --> 01:15:54.779
I went to see her
a couple of times.

01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:59.951
One day I went, I was supposed to be
fixing the electrical box in my house.

01:16:02.953 --> 01:16:05.923
I flew back that night,
I could see my house on fire from the air.

01:16:09.859 --> 01:16:11.261
I knew they were all dead.

01:16:15.032 --> 01:16:17.034
So I just kept flying until
I hit the water.

01:16:23.172 --> 01:16:25.108
The fire brigade
couldn't save my family.

01:16:26.176 --> 01:16:27.979
They got me out
of that river.

01:16:33.016 --> 01:16:34.851
And people from Moosonee

01:16:36.787 --> 01:16:38.990
raised enough money
to fix my fucking plane.

01:16:45.429 --> 01:16:47.832
At the funeral home,
I made the guy open up my wife's casket.

01:16:58.908 --> 01:16:59.978
Made myself look.

01:17:05.048 --> 01:17:06.818
So I'd have to remember.

01:17:11.721 --> 01:17:13.323
So, that's how
I remember her.

01:17:17.293 --> 01:17:18.662
Hmm.

01:17:44.020 --> 01:17:45.389
They look
just like my nieces.

01:17:46.923 --> 01:17:49.191
The little one looks
just like Suzanne.

01:17:49.193 --> 01:17:50.194
Mmm-hmm.

01:18:23.860 --> 01:18:25.296
My wife...

01:18:42.345 --> 01:18:44.715
And you can't hide
until you die.

01:19:55.519 --> 01:19:58.152
<i>There's more about
the connection to the land</i>

01:19:58.154 --> 01:20:00.254
that Annie has here.
You can see it in her eyes.

01:20:00.256 --> 01:20:05.960
The rust reminiscent of the
sweet grass and the red sunset.

01:20:05.962 --> 01:20:08.162
This is something
I've been working on.

01:20:08.164 --> 01:20:09.531
Wow, that's really beautiful.

01:20:09.533 --> 01:20:11.333
So, Annie! Um,

01:20:11.335 --> 01:20:13.434
this is obviously
in a very different direction

01:20:13.436 --> 01:20:16.370
than the Jesse was doing
with your twin, uh...

01:20:16.372 --> 01:20:20.375
Do you see yourself as
picking up where she left off?

01:20:20.377 --> 01:20:26.380
- Or are you telling another side of indigenous women's story?
- Um...

01:20:26.382 --> 01:20:28.616
I'm not really
telling anything.

01:20:28.618 --> 01:20:30.384
Okay, I don't mean to put words
in your mouth, but...

01:20:30.386 --> 01:20:33.921
- It is the other side of indigenous women.
- Okay.

01:20:33.923 --> 01:20:38.960
Yeah. The other show was about victimization.
This show is about resilience.

01:20:38.962 --> 01:20:42.464
Annie is a hunter and I
think that comes through.

01:20:42.466 --> 01:20:46.201
Okay! Well, thank you very much.
I'll look forward to seeing that.

01:20:46.203 --> 01:20:49.236
Thank you for taking this time.
Congratulations. Thank you very much, Annie.

01:20:49.238 --> 01:20:52.240
- And, uh...
- Thank you, sir.

01:20:52.242 --> 01:20:55.043
And I want to talk to you
about a possible feature.

01:20:55.045 --> 01:20:56.945
Okay.

01:20:56.947 --> 01:20:59.915
- You did really good, okay?
- Don't make me do that again.

01:20:59.917 --> 01:21:01.148
It's what they want.

01:21:01.150 --> 01:21:02.987
- I mean it.
- Okay.

01:21:03.921 --> 01:21:06.287
I gotta go
talk to him, okay?

01:21:06.289 --> 01:21:08.290
- My place, 6:30.
- I know.

01:21:08.292 --> 01:21:12.259
- We have to leave the apartment. Restaurant by 8:45.
- I know.

01:21:12.261 --> 01:21:13.195
I was just
saying to Cynthia,

01:21:13.197 --> 01:21:14.396
I've been trying to get
the magazine for,

01:21:14.398 --> 01:21:17.432
like, years now to do this
feature on indigenous artists,

01:21:17.434 --> 01:21:18.666
young indigenous artists...

01:21:18.668 --> 01:21:20.001
Bye, Annie.

01:21:20.003 --> 01:21:22.606
I wanna do a group shot.
I've been trying to get a...

01:21:24.373 --> 01:21:26.074
I can't do that stuff.

01:21:26.076 --> 01:21:28.175
So, then, don't do that stuff,
he can do his own publicity.

01:21:28.177 --> 01:21:29.477
Like, he's so bad at it.

01:21:29.479 --> 01:21:31.345
Anyways, listen to me.
I just booked a job.

01:21:31.347 --> 01:21:32.680
It's for three weeks
in the Cayman Islands.

01:21:32.682 --> 01:21:35.150
I think it's from the 21st
to the 5th.

01:21:35.152 --> 01:21:36.284
Are you
gonna be around?

01:21:36.286 --> 01:21:37.251
Yeah.

01:21:37.253 --> 01:21:38.786
I mean, you can stay
with Jesse, that's fine,

01:21:38.788 --> 01:21:41.455
but if you're in the house... Just so
it looks like someone's living there.

01:21:41.457 --> 01:21:43.290
- Hey, guys!
- Hi.

01:21:43.292 --> 01:21:45.727
- Oh, you guys look so beautiful.
- Hi.

01:21:47.596 --> 01:21:49.666
Let's get a table,
I'm starving.

01:21:54.805 --> 01:21:57.371
Annie, I didn't know
you were still in town.

01:21:57.373 --> 01:22:00.375
Yeah, um, I texted you,

01:22:00.377 --> 01:22:02.246
and told you, so...

01:22:04.448 --> 01:22:07.382
And, uh, no new news
from Suzanne, huh?

01:22:07.384 --> 01:22:10.085
No. Oh, my God, no.
But her mom got a postcard.

01:22:10.087 --> 01:22:11.385
Are you serious?

01:22:11.387 --> 01:22:14.321
- Yeah, isn't that crazy?
- Oh, my God.

01:22:14.323 --> 01:22:17.594
Jesus. Wow. What a relief.
When was that?

01:22:18.761 --> 01:22:21.495
Uh, like a few weeks ago.

01:22:21.497 --> 01:22:23.999
- Yeah.
- Did she say where she is?

01:22:24.001 --> 01:22:26.668
She just...
She didn't say much.

01:22:26.670 --> 01:22:29.137
Of course.

01:22:29.139 --> 01:22:31.039
Still, that's great news.

01:22:31.041 --> 01:22:33.141
- Yeah, you gotta go.
- I have a dinner.

01:22:33.143 --> 01:22:34.442
So...

01:22:34.444 --> 01:22:38.178
- We just got here.
- I know!

01:22:38.180 --> 01:22:39.580
Sorry, bye.

01:22:39.582 --> 01:22:42.250
- Can you grab some coffee?
- Yup.

01:22:42.252 --> 01:22:45.754
He wants to buy two of the
vertical ones for his boardroom.

01:22:45.756 --> 01:22:47.621
- Wow!
- Guy's major.

01:22:47.623 --> 01:22:49.225
Cynthia thinks
it's a done deal.

01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:52.259
- So we'll see.
- What's the passcode?

01:22:52.261 --> 01:22:54.528
- What?
- The passcode?

01:22:54.530 --> 01:22:57.068
The restaurant wants
a reservation.

01:22:58.268 --> 01:23:01.302
Oh, jeez, 4051.

01:24:08.838 --> 01:24:10.871
Do you think
we should get an Uber?

01:24:10.873 --> 01:24:12.777
Just so we don't
have to worry about parking.

01:24:14.478 --> 01:24:15.746
What's wrong?

01:24:17.279 --> 01:24:19.149
I saw what you did.

01:24:31.461 --> 01:24:33.064
Say something.

01:24:35.798 --> 01:24:38.665
I didn't think it would
change anything if I told you.

01:24:38.667 --> 01:24:41.404
And then I didn't know...
Know how.

01:24:43.405 --> 01:24:44.774
Wasn't sure.

01:24:47.777 --> 01:24:49.279
To tell me what?

01:24:50.579 --> 01:24:52.080
That she was using,

01:24:52.082 --> 01:24:56.351
or that you were taking a picture and
painting out what you couldn't sell.

01:24:56.353 --> 01:24:58.152
She told me
to do that, okay?

01:24:58.154 --> 01:24:59.456
She didn't want people
to see her like that.

01:25:00.690 --> 01:25:03.860
I took her to the hospital,
more times than I can tell you.

01:25:04.661 --> 01:25:06.294
I checked her into rehab.

01:25:06.296 --> 01:25:10.665
I even tried to take her out of the
country with me, just to get away from Gus.

01:25:10.667 --> 01:25:12.436
And the shit
he was feeding her.

01:25:13.603 --> 01:25:15.506
She just wanted me
to keep her working.

01:25:16.939 --> 01:25:19.507
Even when she couldn't.

01:25:19.509 --> 01:25:22.576
And when she went missing,
I looked for her.

01:25:22.578 --> 01:25:25.879
I tried to find Gus.
I went to places you never wanna see.

01:25:25.881 --> 01:25:27.784
I went to the police.
I didn't know what else to do.

01:25:29.886 --> 01:25:33.554
You reported her missing,

01:25:33.556 --> 01:25:35.326
but you didn't
give your name.

01:25:37.927 --> 01:25:40.363
You selfish
fucking coward.

01:25:40.863 --> 01:25:42.664
What about us?

01:25:42.666 --> 01:25:46.300
What about my family?
The whole time,

01:25:46.302 --> 01:25:50.604
you never thought, "Oh,
maybe I should call her family!"

01:25:50.606 --> 01:25:52.906
That didn't occur to you?

01:25:52.908 --> 01:25:54.709
She said it would
kill your mother.

01:25:54.711 --> 01:25:57.280
What about me?
Why didn't you call me?

01:26:02.519 --> 01:26:04.255
She said that you hated
her guts.

01:26:08.891 --> 01:26:10.627
What was I supposed to do?

01:26:15.564 --> 01:26:17.300
Annie!

01:26:58.274 --> 01:27:00.243
Annie! Is that you?

01:27:01.011 --> 01:27:02.880
Danny brought some wine.

01:27:07.951 --> 01:27:09.584
Hey, what's goin' on?

01:27:09.586 --> 01:27:11.419
Whoa. Where are you going?

01:27:11.421 --> 01:27:14.289
- I gotta go home.
- What? Why?

01:27:14.291 --> 01:27:16.023
Why?

01:27:16.025 --> 01:27:18.925
- Danny!
- I just gotta go.

01:27:18.927 --> 01:27:22.030
She's going home.
Why? What happened?

01:27:22.032 --> 01:27:24.802
Is Suzanne
back in Moosonee?

01:27:25.868 --> 01:27:27.904
Why don't you ask
your friend Gus?

01:27:29.738 --> 01:27:31.805
Gus is out of the picture.

01:27:31.807 --> 01:27:35.910
- My God, what the fuck?
- Stay the fuck down.

01:27:35.912 --> 01:27:37.911
Here's the thing.

01:27:37.913 --> 01:27:41.014
Gus and your junkie sister stole
a shitload of dope from me.

01:27:41.016 --> 01:27:43.518
Now since Gus has been
taken out of the equation,

01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:46.454
it means that your sister
is sitting on a lot of my dope,

01:27:46.456 --> 01:27:48.690
or a lot of my cash, or both.

01:27:48.692 --> 01:27:49.924
So, let's try it again.

01:27:49.926 --> 01:27:52.660
- Danny, fucking stop it.
- Shut your fucking mouth.

01:27:54.463 --> 01:27:55.963
Shut your fucking face.

01:27:55.965 --> 01:27:57.632
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Motherfucker.

01:27:57.634 --> 01:27:59.901
Okay, listen to me.
Here we go.

01:27:59.903 --> 01:28:01.736
Here we go.

01:28:01.738 --> 01:28:03.771
Just tell me
where she is.

01:28:03.773 --> 01:28:05.540
I don't know.

01:28:05.542 --> 01:28:07.442
- Annie?
- I don't know.

01:28:07.444 --> 01:28:11.282
I don't know.

01:28:12.015 --> 01:28:13.751
Tell me where she is.

01:28:15.984 --> 01:28:18.054
Where's Suzanne?

01:28:20.756 --> 01:28:22.725
She's dead.

01:28:26.962 --> 01:28:29.565
You better fucking
hope I don't find her first.

01:28:47.817 --> 01:28:49.386
Annie!

01:28:50.420 --> 01:28:51.785
Are you okay?

01:28:51.787 --> 01:28:53.287
I'm so sorry.

01:28:53.289 --> 01:28:57.627
I've never seen him like that.
I swear to God, please, Annie. I'm sorry.

01:28:59.162 --> 01:29:01.963
Are you okay?
Please don't call the police.

01:29:01.965 --> 01:29:03.766
Stop crying.

01:29:07.636 --> 01:29:10.004
I'm so sorry.

01:29:10.006 --> 01:29:14.509
Please don't call the police, Annie.
Danny is really dangerous.

01:29:14.511 --> 01:29:16.013
He's gonna come
after me.

01:29:34.096 --> 01:29:36.032
<i>She sent me a postcard,</i>

01:29:37.033 --> 01:29:39.166
<i>from Toronto.</i>

01:29:39.168 --> 01:29:40.671
<i>She said she's coming
home soon.</i>

01:29:43.573 --> 01:29:45.205
<i>I told Annie.
I told her to come back.</i>

01:29:45.207 --> 01:29:47.143
<i>But she wants
to keep looking.</i>

01:29:51.648 --> 01:29:52.850
<i>Well...</i>

01:29:56.586 --> 01:29:58.753
Good news, Lis.
Yup.

01:29:58.755 --> 01:30:00.490
<i>You okay?</i>

01:30:02.057 --> 01:30:05.692
Hey, listen. I, uh...

01:30:05.694 --> 01:30:08.228
I just got in.
I'll call you back later, okay?

01:30:08.230 --> 01:30:10.501
<i>Okay. Call me.</i>

01:30:11.167 --> 01:30:12.169
<i>Okay?</i>

01:30:14.503 --> 01:30:15.639
Okay.

01:30:40.195 --> 01:30:41.896
I'm not saying it's forever.

01:30:41.898 --> 01:30:44.098
I'm just saying it's
going to be a long winter.

01:30:44.100 --> 01:30:46.170
You'd be better off here
with me and the girls.

01:30:47.069 --> 01:30:48.469
I know you've been away,

01:30:48.471 --> 01:30:51.841
but that house is a mess and
it's full of mouse <i>(Native word)</i>

01:30:53.009 --> 01:30:55.011
Is there something wrong,
Lisette?

01:30:56.945 --> 01:30:58.481
It's Marius.

01:31:00.550 --> 01:31:01.851
He got shot in the head.

01:31:03.185 --> 01:31:05.018
The police came around.

01:31:05.020 --> 01:31:06.786
I said that you were
off hunting.

01:31:06.788 --> 01:31:08.891
I said that you left
before he got shot.

01:31:10.894 --> 01:31:13.831
George is coming over.
He wants to talk to you.

01:31:15.532 --> 01:31:16.600
Okay.

01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:19.769
He's not dead.

01:31:22.070 --> 01:31:23.806
Guess he got lucky, heh?

01:31:26.074 --> 01:31:28.545
Not so lucky.
Brain damage.

01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:34.550
Anyway, we, uh, pretty much
written it off as a biker hit.

01:31:35.150 --> 01:31:37.151
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:31:37.153 --> 01:31:39.586
Marius has ran
with some real trash.

01:31:39.588 --> 01:31:41.187
Probably just pissed
the wrong guy off.

01:31:41.189 --> 01:31:43.057
So, where is he?

01:31:43.059 --> 01:31:44.795
He just got out of
rehab last month.

01:31:46.128 --> 01:31:48.728
Anyway,
good talking to you.

01:31:48.730 --> 01:31:49.966
No problem.

01:31:52.301 --> 01:31:55.805
You and I both know,
your flying license expired 20 years ago.

01:31:57.306 --> 01:31:59.639
There's a whole lot of charges
I can throw your way right now,

01:31:59.641 --> 01:32:01.677
but I'm only gonna
ask one thing, all right?

01:32:03.613 --> 01:32:05.548
Next time,
shoot straighter.

01:32:53.729 --> 01:32:56.664
Christ, you might as well
give up.

01:32:56.666 --> 01:32:58.732
They got that
whatchamacallit,

01:32:58.734 --> 01:33:01.137
that Marlin 336.
They're on sale at the Northern Store.

01:33:01.871 --> 01:33:03.937
You should check it out.

01:33:03.939 --> 01:33:06.272
I don't like Marlins.

01:33:06.274 --> 01:33:09.145
Hey, want some tea?

01:33:10.646 --> 01:33:12.245
Lisette's bringing cake.

01:33:12.247 --> 01:33:14.180
Oh, shit.
More cake?

01:33:14.182 --> 01:33:16.150
What, she gettin'
a head start on her...

01:33:16.152 --> 01:33:17.918
On her
whatchamacallit there,

01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:20.120
Christmas baking?

01:33:20.122 --> 01:33:22.223
She hasn't baked
in six months.

01:33:22.225 --> 01:33:23.657
She only bakes
when she's happy.

01:33:23.659 --> 01:33:25.228
So you eat whatever
she walks in here, okay?

01:33:26.194 --> 01:33:28.230
Oh, I like cake, me.
I love cake.

01:33:30.233 --> 01:33:32.069
Well, I live off the cake, eh.

01:33:40.810 --> 01:33:42.045
You okay?

01:33:56.158 --> 01:33:59.360
So...

01:33:59.362 --> 01:34:02.763
So, since you have your arm around
the sister, I guess you must be Will.

01:34:02.765 --> 01:34:06.067
- Yeah.
- Good. So here's the thing, Will.

01:34:06.069 --> 01:34:09.673
I'm looking for your niece Suzanne
and I'm hoping you can help me out.

01:34:13.141 --> 01:34:14.845
I don't know
where Suzanne is.

01:34:16.479 --> 01:34:18.081
Hmm.

01:34:26.956 --> 01:34:30.127
Hey, Mom.
I got her that job.

01:34:35.363 --> 01:34:37.098
You play?

01:34:37.100 --> 01:34:39.403
- No.
- Then how come you got the clubs?

01:34:41.002 --> 01:34:44.405
Some guy brought 'em up from
Toronto on a hunting trip.

01:34:44.407 --> 01:34:46.473
Didn't know where he was coming
to, I guess.

01:34:53.315 --> 01:34:54.717
Don't I know the feeling.

01:34:58.820 --> 01:35:01.488
They're not bad, you know.

01:35:01.490 --> 01:35:03.092
Maybe you should learn.

01:35:07.262 --> 01:35:09.330
I don't know
where Suzanne is.

01:35:09.332 --> 01:35:10.901
Well, here's what I think.

01:35:12.368 --> 01:35:14.438
I think she came back
to Moosonee.

01:35:15.304 --> 01:35:17.504
Jesus Christ.

01:35:17.506 --> 01:35:19.341
She hasn't been
here for years.

01:35:20.408 --> 01:35:21.811
He knows that.

01:35:27.250 --> 01:35:29.351
Are we interrupting
a party?

01:35:31.020 --> 01:35:32.986
Were you gonna make tea?

01:35:32.988 --> 01:35:34.821
Yeah.

01:35:34.823 --> 01:35:36.792
Well, is there enough
in here for everybody?

01:35:37.393 --> 01:35:40.193
Jesus.

01:35:40.195 --> 01:35:41.995
I told you we don't know
where Suzanne is.

01:35:41.997 --> 01:35:43.199
Get up.

01:35:52.841 --> 01:35:56.145
What are we doing here, Will?
Do we really just...

01:35:57.279 --> 01:35:58.948
keep going?

01:36:02.150 --> 01:36:04.220
This has nothing to do with
her, Marius.

01:36:05.220 --> 01:36:08.923
If you wanna shoot me,
go ahead.

01:36:08.925 --> 01:36:12.125
- The shit between you and me, is between you and...
- No.

01:36:12.127 --> 01:36:15.765
Will, it's between
you and me.

01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:20.337
If you just tell me where
your niece is,

01:36:21.170 --> 01:36:23.870
then I'm done here.

01:36:23.872 --> 01:36:25.474
You understand that,
right?

01:36:29.444 --> 01:36:30.846
That's it.

01:36:32.948 --> 01:36:34.784
I don't know.

01:36:37.252 --> 01:36:39.822
Okay. Okay.

01:36:44.092 --> 01:36:46.128
This fucking family.

01:36:49.431 --> 01:36:51.397
Get him out.
Get him the fuck out.

01:36:51.399 --> 01:36:54.934
Get him, Marius, get him the
fuck out and that fuckhead, too.

01:36:54.936 --> 01:36:56.503
This fucking girl.

01:36:56.505 --> 01:36:59.173
This fuckin' family.

01:36:59.175 --> 01:37:02.112
Get your
fuckin' ass down.

01:37:02.944 --> 01:37:04.213
Get the fuck out.

01:37:33.242 --> 01:37:35.375
Where is she?

01:37:35.377 --> 01:37:38.077
I'm gonna shoot you
in the head, bro.

01:37:38.079 --> 01:37:39.979
You tell me
where Suzanne is,

01:37:39.981 --> 01:37:41.615
and I'll only shoot out
one of your eyes.

01:37:41.617 --> 01:37:43.420
Stop fucking around,
Marius.

01:37:58.701 --> 01:38:03.137
Maybe you would like it if I went back
inside and finished her off, first, Will.

01:38:03.139 --> 01:38:04.373
Is that what you'd like?

01:38:05.975 --> 01:38:07.477
Five seconds.

01:38:09.078 --> 01:38:10.347
One.

01:38:11.113 --> 01:38:12.414
Two.

01:38:13.048 --> 01:38:14.216
Three.

01:38:14.649 --> 01:38:15.951
Four.

01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:19.119
Okay.

01:38:19.121 --> 01:38:20.657
We're done here.

01:39:39.368 --> 01:39:41.701
- Sergeant Cusano?
- <i>Speaking.</i>

01:39:41.703 --> 01:39:44.170
- Hey, it's Annie Bird.
- <i>Hi, Annie.</i>

01:39:44.172 --> 01:39:46.440
I was calling about that tip
you mentioned last time.

01:39:46.442 --> 01:39:49.108
About the body you found
off the ravine on Bay View.

01:39:49.110 --> 01:39:51.711
<i>No, it didn't match
your sister's description.</i>

01:39:51.713 --> 01:39:53.115
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

01:40:02.390 --> 01:40:05.427
You were right about
those stupid traps, you.

01:40:06.462 --> 01:40:07.464
Full.

01:40:08.497 --> 01:40:10.233
Pelts are drying
in the shed.

01:40:11.934 --> 01:40:14.671
<i>Gotta deal with those jerks at the store.
Get you a good price.</i>

01:40:21.077 --> 01:40:23.113
Keep talking to him.

01:40:23.845 --> 01:40:25.545
We don't know
what he hears.

01:40:25.547 --> 01:40:29.450
<i>I promise you
Annie, I will call if I get anything.</i>

01:40:29.452 --> 01:40:32.355
Like even if someone thinks
they see her.

01:40:33.622 --> 01:40:35.155
Toronto.

01:40:35.157 --> 01:40:37.060
Huh. Ever weird,
that place.

01:40:39.127 --> 01:40:40.229
I got some stories.

01:40:58.613 --> 01:41:00.416
So, I'll check in
next week, then.

01:41:24.907 --> 01:41:26.842
And I'm still trying.

01:41:29.345 --> 01:41:31.081
You need to know that.

01:41:34.617 --> 01:41:36.916
I'm not letting
her go, okay?

01:43:21.789 --> 01:43:23.826
Anne, you came back.

01:43:25.426 --> 01:43:26.862
It's Annie, Uncle.

01:43:28.863 --> 01:43:30.599
Tell him again.

01:43:32.368 --> 01:43:33.736
It's Annie.

01:43:37.405 --> 01:43:38.507
I know.

01:43:49.685 --> 01:43:51.387
You're gonna be all right.

01:44:52.817 --> 01:44:57.817
