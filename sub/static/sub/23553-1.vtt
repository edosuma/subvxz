00:41.909 --> 00:42.941

at Bliss Mountain.

01:00.394 --> 01:01.360
Ah...

01:01.395 --> 01:02.406
Run inside, and see
if you can find someone

01:02.430 --> 01:03.695
to help us
with our bags.

01:03.731 --> 01:05.297
- Okay!
- No, Phil, not you.

01:05.331 --> 01:07.933
And watch our for that ice,
it's slippery.

01:07.968 --> 01:09.301
Yes, Dad.
I'll be careful.

01:09.336 --> 01:10.702
I know what
you're saying, okay?

01:10.738 --> 01:11.937
Look, I'll talk
to the office

01:11.972 --> 01:12.972
as soon as I can, okay?

01:14.108 --> 01:15.741
Ooh! I'm sorry!

01:15.776 --> 01:16.508
Sorry.

01:16.544 --> 01:17.654
I'm sorry...
No, not you, Phil.

01:17.678 --> 01:19.244
Uh...

01:19.280 --> 01:20.512
Here, let me... help you.

01:21.849 --> 01:23.482
- Thank you.
- Just a suggestion,

01:23.517 --> 01:27.419
you put your skis
back-to-back, like that,

01:27.455 --> 01:28.465
throw 'em
over your shoulder,

01:28.489 --> 01:29.588
tips down.

01:29.623 --> 01:30.923
All right?

01:30.958 --> 01:32.057
That's perfect, thank you.

01:32.093 --> 01:32.891
Uh-huh.

01:32.927 --> 01:33.892
Phil?

01:33.928 --> 01:34.960
Uh, hello?

01:34.995 --> 01:38.163
Do you always carry on
two conversations at once?

01:38.199 --> 01:40.065
Sure, yeah.

01:40.101 --> 01:41.421
I get twice as much
done that way.

01:42.002 --> 01:43.502
Oh.

01:43.537 --> 01:46.071
But the two people listening
only get half as much done?

01:46.107 --> 01:47.840
I never thought of it that way.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.608
First time to Bliss Valley?

01:49.643 --> 01:50.442
Uh, yeah,

01:50.478 --> 01:51.310
from New York.

01:51.345 --> 01:53.512
I'm here for 10 days
with my daughter.

01:53.547 --> 01:56.181
One of us is getting ski lessons
from Maddy Morrison this week.

01:56.217 --> 01:57.483
Oh.

01:57.518 --> 01:58.617
And the other?

01:58.652 --> 02:00.786
Doesn't really
have time to ski

02:00.821 --> 02:01.653
because he's too busy working

02:01.689 --> 02:03.489
to pay for his daughter's
ski lessons.

02:03.524 --> 02:04.256
Ah.

02:04.291 --> 02:07.426
Well, uh,
welcome to Bliss Valley.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.026
Oh, I almost forgot,

02:09.062 --> 02:12.331
we're throwing this big bash
on Saturday,

02:12.366 --> 02:15.434
with live music,
and fun and food.

02:15.469 --> 02:16.435
Maybe you could come.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.203
- Winterfest?
- Yeah.

02:18.239 --> 02:19.705
That's great,
thank you.

02:19.740 --> 02:20.639
Thanks!

02:20.674 --> 02:21.840
Mm-hmm.

02:21.876 --> 02:23.976
Ooh...
Uh... I got it.

02:24.011 --> 02:25.644
- I know how to...
- Yup.

02:25.679 --> 02:26.679
Skis back-to-back.

02:26.714 --> 02:28.514
Yes.

02:36.991 --> 02:38.157
Again?

02:38.192 --> 02:39.625
Come on!

02:43.497 --> 02:44.696
Huh...

02:44.732 --> 02:46.532
Looks like I've gotta...

02:46.567 --> 02:48.667
call somebody.

02:48.702 --> 02:49.868
Boy, oh, boy.

02:49.904 --> 02:51.637
Oh, no, Jasper,

02:51.672 --> 02:52.804
that does not
sound good.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.706
Are we gonna have to
borrow the Snowcat

02:54.742 --> 02:56.008
from Epic Mountain again?

02:56.043 --> 02:57.220
No, Kat, we're not.

02:57.244 --> 02:59.378
A New Year means
new beginnings,

02:59.413 --> 03:00.657
and if I can keep
the ski lifts going

03:00.681 --> 03:01.713
at the resort,

03:01.749 --> 03:02.681
I can sure fix
that old thing...

03:02.716 --> 03:03.682
If you say so.

03:03.717 --> 03:04.683
Though I must say,

03:04.718 --> 03:05.651
when I inherited
the resort,

03:05.686 --> 03:06.985
I didn't realize

03:07.021 --> 03:08.398
I'd be inheriting
a mountain of problems.

03:08.422 --> 03:09.488
Yeah.

03:09.523 --> 03:10.556
Have a good one.

03:10.591 --> 03:11.523
Good morning, Kat.

03:11.559 --> 03:13.559
Oh, hey, Mayor.

03:13.594 --> 03:15.727
I think it's gonna be
beautiful today.

03:15.763 --> 03:17.174
There's lots of snow
on the mountain,

03:17.198 --> 03:19.042
and it's meant to be
clearing up this afternoon.

03:19.066 --> 03:20.098
So they say.

03:20.134 --> 03:21.533
All we need now
on those slopes

03:21.569 --> 03:22.901
are some actual skiers.

03:22.937 --> 03:24.670
Oh, you're preaching
to the choir.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.338
Have a nice day!

03:27.474 --> 03:29.675
Yeah, they just arrived.

03:29.710 --> 03:32.377
We'll order some of those
new boots, too, okay?

03:32.413 --> 03:33.413
Thanks.

03:34.448 --> 03:35.414
- Hi.
- Hey, honey.

03:35.449 --> 03:36.548
The new skis
just came in.

03:36.584 --> 03:37.584
What do you think?

03:37.618 --> 03:38.684
Ooh...

03:38.719 --> 03:40.519
Wow, impressive.

03:42.122 --> 03:43.689
Yeah, they've got
a good weight.

03:43.724 --> 03:44.590
Yeah.

03:44.625 --> 03:45.791
You'd fly on those things.

03:45.826 --> 03:47.693
It almost
wouldn't be fair.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.695
My racing days are over, Pops.

03:49.730 --> 03:50.929
I'm just sayin',

03:50.965 --> 03:52.097
on skis like that,

03:52.132 --> 03:54.766
you would fly
like the wind...

03:54.802 --> 03:56.112
Well, maybe if you wouldn't
have been on the interweb,

03:56.136 --> 03:58.937
you would've seen
the left-hand turn.

04:00.608 --> 04:01.640
Well...

04:01.675 --> 04:03.375
You're right, son,
they are open.

04:03.410 --> 04:04.977
Oh, good morning.

04:05.012 --> 04:07.045
Welcome to
Heart of the Mountain.

04:07.081 --> 04:09.748
The ski conditions
are top-notch today.

04:09.783 --> 04:12.584
Well, thank you,
I just need directions.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.920
I got a little lost
coming off the highway.

04:14.955 --> 04:16.399
Let me guess, you're looking for
Epic Mountain?

04:16.423 --> 04:17.423
Yeah.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.391
Is that close by?

04:19.426 --> 04:20.570
Well, it-it's the next valley.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.094
This is Bliss Valley.

04:22.129 --> 04:23.662
So, uh, you go
up the highway,

04:23.697 --> 04:24.630
second exit.

04:24.665 --> 04:25.998
It's big,
you can't miss it.

04:26.033 --> 04:27.466
It's a big chalet, yeah.

04:27.501 --> 04:29.501
Well, great,
thank you.

04:29.536 --> 04:30.969
We've got a lot
of new merchandise.

04:31.005 --> 04:31.870
Uh, well...

04:31.905 --> 04:33.385
I'll get everything I need
up at Epic.

04:34.341 --> 04:36.008
Is this you

04:36.043 --> 04:37.909
with the U.S.
National ski team?

04:37.945 --> 04:40.312
That's Maddy Morrison!

04:40.347 --> 04:41.613
That girl's a superstar.

04:41.649 --> 04:43.248
Yeah.

04:43.284 --> 04:44.816
That's Maddy and me.

04:44.852 --> 04:46.351
Come on, you-you know her?

04:46.387 --> 04:48.453
Well, she may be famous now, but
she grew up here.

04:48.489 --> 04:49.921
And just so you know,

04:49.957 --> 04:51.189
Kat here,

04:51.225 --> 04:53.191
she was on
the U.S. team, too.

04:53.227 --> 04:54.259
Wow.

04:54.295 --> 04:56.028
Dad...

04:56.063 --> 04:58.196
Sorry, Kat, I'm...
I'm just proud, that's all.

04:58.232 --> 04:58.964
All right, well,
thanks so much.

04:58.999 --> 04:59.865
Come on, Bart.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.500
Okay, uh...

05:01.535 --> 05:02.768
I hope to see you
this weekend,

05:02.803 --> 05:04.936
We've got our Winterfest
happening!

05:04.972 --> 05:06.705
It's the 50th year this year!

05:06.740 --> 05:08.307
Gonna be great...

05:08.342 --> 05:10.208
Once again,

05:10.244 --> 05:11.354
we're losing business
to Epic.

05:11.378 --> 05:12.944
Don't let it
bug you, Dad.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.613
It's the same scenery.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.114
We've got better skiing.

05:16.150 --> 05:17.550
I mean, what does
Epic Mountain have

05:17.584 --> 05:19.151
that we don't have?

05:19.186 --> 05:21.553
Well, a multi million-dollar
parent company,

05:21.588 --> 05:23.889
a state-of-the-art
lodge,

05:23.924 --> 05:24.990
condos,

05:25.025 --> 05:26.525
fancy restaurants,

05:26.560 --> 05:27.726
a super-fast gondola...

05:27.761 --> 05:29.227
Okay, okay, okay,
I get your point.

05:29.263 --> 05:30.629
To be honest,

05:30.664 --> 05:31.763
I just don't think

05:31.799 --> 05:34.566
our little shop can survive
another season like this.

05:34.601 --> 05:36.702
Our Winterfest
is our silver bullet.

05:36.737 --> 05:39.037
We've got the torch parade,

05:39.073 --> 05:41.239
live music,

05:41.275 --> 05:43.709
and Maddy Morrison
herself coming in

05:43.744 --> 05:45.711
to coach all the juniors

05:45.746 --> 05:47.145
for the exhibition race.

05:47.181 --> 05:49.314
And with you
at the helm this year,

05:49.350 --> 05:50.990
I know Winterfest
is going to be a winner.

05:52.386 --> 05:53.552
Hey, I, uh, I gotta go.

05:53.587 --> 05:55.053
I gotta meet Lindsay,

05:55.089 --> 05:56.488
we're gonna pass out
these flyers.

05:56.523 --> 05:58.824
So, will you be okay for an hour
without me?

05:58.859 --> 06:00.192
I can hold the fort.

06:00.227 --> 06:01.227
All right.
Love you, Dad.

06:05.366 --> 06:07.165
So, you have to tell me

06:07.201 --> 06:09.267
how you persuaded
Maddy Morrison

06:09.303 --> 06:11.269
to come here and coach?

06:11.305 --> 06:13.905
Uh... it's just
for a week.

06:13.941 --> 06:16.274
Still, that's
a big deal.

06:16.310 --> 06:18.043
Well, Jasper called
on behalf of the resort.

06:18.078 --> 06:21.947
She doesn't actually know
it was me who invited her.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.682
There's a lot of history there,

06:23.717 --> 06:25.283
most of it not good.

06:25.319 --> 06:27.753
But I think it's good
to have a gold medalist here

06:27.788 --> 06:30.222
to teach these kids.

06:30.257 --> 06:31.301
It brings a lot of attention
to the mountain.

06:31.325 --> 06:32.524
You know what,

06:32.559 --> 06:35.394
you are as good a skier
as Maddy ever was.

06:35.429 --> 06:36.628
Uh-huh?

06:36.663 --> 06:37.496
Yeah.

06:37.531 --> 06:40.098
Why don't you coach
these kids yourself?

06:40.134 --> 06:43.268
Well, because nobody wants their
aspiring champion

06:43.303 --> 06:45.704
to be coached by the girl
who choked at Trials.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.472
She's the star, I'm not.

06:47.508 --> 06:49.708
You're still
defending her, huh?

06:49.743 --> 06:51.376
Look, I know she can be
arrogant, but...

06:51.412 --> 06:52.911
she's the champ.

06:53.747 --> 06:54.913
Hang on,

06:54.948 --> 06:57.048
I'm getting paged.

06:58.152 --> 06:59.050
Tommy Adams...

06:59.086 --> 07:00.619
has his tongue stuck

07:00.654 --> 07:02.220
to a frozen
basketball pole again.

07:02.256 --> 07:03.221
Again?

07:03.257 --> 07:04.322
Yeah, again.

07:04.358 --> 07:06.191
You'd think he'd learn.

07:08.262 --> 07:10.295
Here you go.

07:18.839 --> 07:20.605
Dad, this rocks.

07:20.641 --> 07:21.440
How did we get a room

07:21.475 --> 07:22.519
with a perfect view
of the mountain?

07:22.543 --> 07:24.609
The hotel wasn't full up,
so we got a free upgrade.

07:28.215 --> 07:29.781
Kitten socks.
Yours.

07:31.118 --> 07:31.983
Are you nervous
for tomorrow?

07:32.019 --> 07:33.952
To train with
the great Maddy Morrison?

07:33.987 --> 07:35.587
Yeah.

07:35.622 --> 07:38.023
But, you know, if I ever want
a shot at Nationals,

07:38.058 --> 07:39.602
I'm really gonna
have to step up my game.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.359
Spoken like a true
future champ.

07:41.395 --> 07:43.795
And you're my dad,
so you have to say that.

07:43.831 --> 07:45.464
No,

07:45.499 --> 07:46.810
all your instructors in Vermont
said you had real potential,

07:46.834 --> 07:47.699
and they're right.

07:47.734 --> 07:49.835
All right, look,
I'm gonna set my alarm

07:49.870 --> 07:50.769
for very early
in the morning,

07:50.804 --> 07:52.437
so you can get up
and do your stretches.

07:52.473 --> 07:53.716
We'll have some
blueberry pancakes,

07:53.740 --> 07:54.851
and we'll be the first
people on the hill.

07:54.875 --> 07:55.941
What do you say?

07:55.976 --> 07:57.476
How about
blueberry pancakes first,

07:57.511 --> 07:59.344
and then stretches after?

07:59.379 --> 08:01.780
You're in the driver's seat.

08:01.815 --> 08:02.681
I need coffee.

08:02.716 --> 08:03.982
Coffee,
let's go!

08:05.000 --> 08:11.074

08:26.273 --> 08:27.806
Jasper, we have
less than a week

08:27.841 --> 08:28.807
until the event.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.141
What can we do

08:30.177 --> 08:31.457
to make this year
really special?

08:32.712 --> 08:34.412
Well...

08:34.448 --> 08:36.681
Hey, what if we have
a parade with floats

08:36.717 --> 08:38.149
for Winterfest?

08:38.184 --> 08:40.184
Hmm? I mean, we've got
to up our game somehow.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.354
Uh-uh, that's not gonna
bring in the tourists.

08:42.389 --> 08:43.688
We need
to think bigger.

08:43.724 --> 08:44.767
We don't have
the budget for bigger.

08:44.791 --> 08:47.559
Ah, therein
lies the problem...

08:47.594 --> 08:49.494
Kat Miller... hmm.

08:49.530 --> 08:51.496
What do I know
about all this stuff anyway?

08:51.532 --> 08:53.510
I mean, last year, I was just
driving the snow plow.

08:53.534 --> 08:55.400
Well, you know what,
we'll figure it out.

08:55.435 --> 08:58.904
And there she is.
Kat?

08:58.939 --> 09:01.239
I can't believe it.

09:01.275 --> 09:03.008
- Maddy, hi.
- Hi.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.876
- It's been a long time.
- Wow.

09:04.912 --> 09:05.877
So, you did
come back home

09:05.913 --> 09:06.778
and settle down.

09:06.813 --> 09:08.113
Yeah, I did.

09:08.148 --> 09:09.192
I'm actually
chairing the committee

09:09.216 --> 09:11.116
for the Winterfest this year,

09:11.151 --> 09:14.185
and I'm the one who suggested
Jasper invite you.

09:14.221 --> 09:15.253
Oh. Hi.

09:15.289 --> 09:16.187
Hi.

09:16.223 --> 09:17.355
Thank you.

09:17.391 --> 09:20.091
Well, whatever I can do
to help the Junior skiers out,

09:20.127 --> 09:21.092
so much the better.

09:21.128 --> 09:21.993
Plus, it helps out
the town.

09:22.029 --> 09:23.528
So, um, I've been doing
some coaching

09:23.564 --> 09:25.530
up in Vail and Aspen,

09:25.566 --> 09:27.699
and after I teach
this Winterfest class,

09:27.734 --> 09:29.968
I'm heading up to Epic
for the rest of the season.

09:30.003 --> 09:32.904
Oh, well, thanks
for helping us out first,

09:32.940 --> 09:33.972
we really need it.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.941
Sure.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.542
So, your name
comes up a lot.

09:37.578 --> 09:38.721
I was just doing
a guest coaching stint

09:38.745 --> 09:39.678
up at Sun Valley,

09:39.713 --> 09:41.379
and some of the skiers
were just wondering

09:41.415 --> 09:43.048
what you'd been up to.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.550
Oh, well, I run
the ski shop with my Dad,

09:45.586 --> 09:47.330
and I'm working with
some future champions myself.

09:47.354 --> 09:48.653
Oh,

09:48.689 --> 09:50.488
so you're doing
some coaching?

09:50.524 --> 09:52.157
Hey, it's Maddy Morrison!

09:52.192 --> 09:53.658
Not exactly.

09:53.694 --> 09:54.526
Hey!

09:54.561 --> 09:57.762
Girls, welcome
to the beginners' class.

09:57.798 --> 09:59.631
Let me help you with these.

09:59.666 --> 10:02.801
Who is ready
to have some fun today?

10:02.836 --> 10:03.802
Hi, kids!

10:03.837 --> 10:05.704
Maddy Morrison.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.239
Hi!

10:08.275 --> 10:09.841
Well, I'd better
get up to my class.

10:09.876 --> 10:11.843
See you at the top
of the mountain!

10:11.878 --> 10:13.478
Hey, Maddy, can I,
uh, grab a selfie?

10:13.513 --> 10:14.746
Sure. All right.

10:16.016 --> 10:17.360
Make sure to put
a filter on it, right?

10:17.384 --> 10:18.350
Okay, yeah.

10:18.385 --> 10:19.351
And tag me!

10:19.386 --> 10:20.352
I will.

10:20.387 --> 10:21.431
All right, we're gonna
head up the mountain.

10:21.455 --> 10:22.954
You got all your gear?

10:22.990 --> 10:25.123
I got your skis.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.274
Dad, come on,
we're gonna be late.

10:31.298 --> 10:32.330
Okay.

10:32.366 --> 10:33.999
I can't believe I overslept.

10:34.034 --> 10:35.634
It must be
this fresh mountain air.

10:35.669 --> 10:36.635
It's so nice...
Here, I'll take those.

10:36.670 --> 10:37.402
Gimme, gimme, gimme.

10:37.437 --> 10:38.870
Dad, you don't need
the pancakes...

10:38.905 --> 10:40.438
Yes, you have to
eat something.

10:40.474 --> 10:41.206
We'll eat it
on the lift, okay?

10:41.241 --> 10:42.841
- Come on.
- All right, let's go.

10:45.912 --> 10:46.978
Okay...

10:47.014 --> 10:48.480
You okay, Dad?

10:48.515 --> 10:49.381
This is exciting.

10:49.416 --> 10:50.649
Yeah.

10:50.684 --> 10:51.716
Be careful, though.

10:51.752 --> 10:53.118
Okay...

10:54.655 --> 10:56.121
All right.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.889
Good.

10:57.924 --> 10:58.957
You okay?

10:58.992 --> 11:00.025
Yeah, I'm good.

11:00.060 --> 11:01.660
I haven't been on
in a long time...

11:01.695 --> 11:02.861
Oh! Oh!

11:02.896 --> 11:03.862
Dad!

11:03.897 --> 11:05.096
That's breakfast. Okay.

11:07.401 --> 11:09.134
All right, girls,

11:09.169 --> 11:10.609
let's swing
our right foot forward...

11:11.672 --> 11:13.405
And really lean
into the stretch.

11:13.440 --> 11:14.305
That's really good, Rachel.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.541
Bend your elbows,

11:16.576 --> 11:18.510
and dig your poles
into the ground,

11:18.545 --> 11:19.844
and really push...

11:19.880 --> 11:21.846
Here, take these
energy bars,

11:21.882 --> 11:22.747
you're going
to need them.

11:22.783 --> 11:23.848
Thanks, Dad.

11:23.884 --> 11:24.849
Hi, sorry!
Sorry we're late!

11:24.885 --> 11:25.928
Completely my, uh,
my fault.

11:25.952 --> 11:28.520
- This is my daughter, Anna.
- Hi.

11:28.555 --> 11:30.088
Hi, Anna.
Welcome aboard.

11:30.123 --> 11:31.501
You ready to do
some serious skiing?

11:31.525 --> 11:33.158
- You bet.
- Great.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.259
Join the group.

11:34.294 --> 11:35.654
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck, honey.

11:38.098 --> 11:39.397
You're Maddy Morrison.

11:39.433 --> 11:41.666
Okay, sir, thank you so much.

11:41.702 --> 11:44.069
- She's in good hands.
- Bye!

11:44.104 --> 11:45.070
All right, we have

11:45.105 --> 11:47.238
a little exhibition race
for you this weekend,

11:47.274 --> 11:49.741
which means
we have one week

11:49.776 --> 11:51.876
to get you warriors
ready for battle.

11:51.912 --> 11:53.144
Who's in?

11:57.117 --> 11:58.157
All right, gals, let's go!

12:00.921 --> 12:02.554
All right, Amy.

12:02.589 --> 12:04.656
You got this, girl.

12:08.328 --> 12:09.706
Good, good, good.
Keep your head up, honey.

12:09.730 --> 12:11.396
That's awesome!

12:11.431 --> 12:12.630
Great job!

12:12.666 --> 12:14.365
Let's go!

12:14.401 --> 12:15.734
Push it!

12:15.769 --> 12:17.702
Push harder!

12:17.738 --> 12:19.471
Come on, pick it up, let's go!

12:19.506 --> 12:21.573
Same old Maddy...

12:22.676 --> 12:23.676
Oh.

12:24.678 --> 12:26.044
That's okay.

12:29.282 --> 12:30.282
It's okay.

12:30.317 --> 12:31.282
Sometimes, we fall,

12:31.318 --> 12:33.585
and then we gotta learn
how to get back up.

12:33.620 --> 12:34.620
You all right?

12:36.256 --> 12:38.089
Kat, I lost my scarf somewhere!

12:39.292 --> 12:41.292
Oh, uh...

12:42.829 --> 12:44.062
Oh, there it is.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.097
I'll be right back.

12:51.204 --> 12:52.504
Found it!

12:52.539 --> 12:54.472
Come on, Anna!

12:54.508 --> 12:55.585
It's your turn!
Come on down!

12:55.609 --> 12:58.243
Come on, you're up next,
let's go!

13:07.187 --> 13:08.419
What's up?

13:08.455 --> 13:09.455
Hey.

13:10.824 --> 13:11.856
Come on, Anna!

13:11.892 --> 13:13.324
Let's go!

13:19.065 --> 13:20.431
Pick up
your speed, Anna!

13:20.467 --> 13:21.800
Harder!

13:24.204 --> 13:27.105
Lean into your edge, Anna!
Come on!

13:27.140 --> 13:28.140
Push it!

13:29.676 --> 13:30.742
Ugh...

13:34.714 --> 13:35.780
No, no, no,

13:35.816 --> 13:36.714
there'll be no one
to pick you up

13:36.750 --> 13:37.794
if you fall
during the race.

13:37.818 --> 13:39.217
You gotta learn
to do it yourself.

13:39.252 --> 13:40.830
Okay, pick it up,
let's get back in the fight.

13:40.854 --> 13:42.153
Let's go, girls!

13:48.094 --> 13:49.094
Hey.

13:53.667 --> 13:55.800
Try to relax.

13:55.836 --> 13:57.596
Let your skis feel
the slope of the mountain.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.684
You were on your inside edge,
that's why you fell.

14:01.708 --> 14:03.341
Thanks for the advice.

14:04.544 --> 14:05.877
Let's go, Anna.
Come on.

14:16.723 --> 14:18.489
Hey.

14:18.525 --> 14:19.424
Hey, kiddo!

14:19.459 --> 14:20.391
How'd it go out there?

14:20.427 --> 14:22.427
I must have
fallen, like, 10 times.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.028
I'm sorry.

14:24.064 --> 14:25.330
Uh, how was-how was Maddy?

14:25.365 --> 14:26.531
She a good coach?

14:26.566 --> 14:29.167
Uh, well, she's a better coach
than the people up in Vermont,

14:29.202 --> 14:30.902
but she was
barking at me all day.

14:30.937 --> 14:32.114
Well, I just saw you come
down the mountain just now.

14:32.138 --> 14:34.205
Your turns looked so smooth.

14:34.241 --> 14:35.406
You're already
progressing.

14:35.442 --> 14:37.008
Well, thanks,
but that wasn't Maddy.

14:37.043 --> 14:39.021
There was this ski instructor
who saw me up on the hill,

14:39.045 --> 14:40.445
gave me a tip,

14:40.480 --> 14:41.757
and it actually
really started to work.

14:41.781 --> 14:43.548
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:43.583 --> 14:45.617
Yeah, okay,
I'll see you later!

14:45.652 --> 14:47.886
Ooh, hey,
there she is right now.

14:47.921 --> 14:49.687
- Hey!
- Huh?

14:49.723 --> 14:51.356
Oh! Hi!

14:51.391 --> 14:52.523
I just wanted to say

14:52.559 --> 14:55.059
that your tip actually really
started to help my turns!

14:55.095 --> 14:56.127
Oh, yeah.

14:56.162 --> 14:58.396
I mean, turns were always
the hardest thing for me.

14:58.431 --> 15:00.309
I mean, you're flying down
the mountain one way,

15:00.333 --> 15:02.533
and then boom, you're going
the other direction.

15:02.569 --> 15:03.401
Well, thank you.

15:03.436 --> 15:04.569
Um, I'm Anna, by the way.

15:04.604 --> 15:05.403
This is my Dad, Ty.

15:05.438 --> 15:06.404
Hi.

15:06.439 --> 15:07.572
Oh.

15:07.607 --> 15:08.573
- Tyler Decker.
- Yup.

15:08.608 --> 15:09.540
Nice to meet you.

15:09.576 --> 15:10.408
Again.

15:10.443 --> 15:11.743
Again?

15:11.778 --> 15:12.644
You two
know each other?

15:12.679 --> 15:13.711
Yeah...

15:13.747 --> 15:14.747
Mr. Multi-Tasker.

15:15.916 --> 15:18.082
I'm Kat Miller.

15:18.118 --> 15:19.729
Yeah, um, Kat here taught me
how to carry my skis properly

15:19.753 --> 15:20.785
yesterday.

15:20.820 --> 15:22.487
So now she's
helped us both.

15:22.522 --> 15:24.756
So I guess we owe her
two thank you's.

15:24.791 --> 15:26.491
You're welcome.

15:26.526 --> 15:27.603
You're-you're
a ski instructor?

15:27.627 --> 15:31.629
Oh, I just instruct
on the bunny slope, but, uh...

15:31.665 --> 15:32.665
What's this work?

15:32.699 --> 15:33.843
What do you got
going on here?

15:33.867 --> 15:35.566
Oh, just some
computer stuff

15:35.602 --> 15:38.136
to pay for
all this splendor.

15:38.171 --> 15:39.604
I work in advertising.

15:39.639 --> 15:42.607
Yeah, have you seen
those dancing juice boxes?

15:44.110 --> 15:45.777
Really? That's you?

15:45.812 --> 15:46.844
Yeah, guilty
as charged.

15:46.880 --> 15:47.946
Oh, gosh...

15:47.981 --> 15:49.347
Honey...

15:49.382 --> 15:51.082
time for
your protein shake.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.283
Uh, yeah.

15:52.319 --> 15:53.351
My, uh, Dad's other job

15:53.386 --> 15:55.019
is being my part-time coach.

15:55.055 --> 15:55.920
Oh, okay.

15:55.956 --> 15:57.500
Yeah, I studied at
an in-depth ski academy.

15:57.524 --> 15:58.923
The Internet.

15:58.959 --> 16:00.925
Oh, I see.

16:00.961 --> 16:02.271
No, uh, I may advise
a little bit,

16:02.295 --> 16:03.928
but Anna is always
in the driver's seat

16:03.964 --> 16:04.974
when it comes to her training.

16:04.998 --> 16:07.198
Although she's technically
too young to drive.

16:07.233 --> 16:09.133
All right, well,
it's nice to meet you guys.

16:09.169 --> 16:10.368
Thanks...

16:10.403 --> 16:11.336
Wait a second,

16:11.371 --> 16:13.871
are you, uh, the Kat Miller,
like, the skier?

16:13.907 --> 16:16.441
I've seen your races
on YouTube!

16:16.476 --> 16:17.542
You're amazing.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.377
What are you doing
in Bliss Valley?

16:19.412 --> 16:20.478
Well...

16:20.513 --> 16:22.847
I've just been working
at the ski shop with my dad.

16:22.882 --> 16:24.382
It's, uh...

16:24.417 --> 16:25.183
called "Heart of the Mountain".

16:25.218 --> 16:26.617
You guys should
come by sometime.

16:26.653 --> 16:27.685
Absolutely.

16:27.721 --> 16:28.764
Yeah, do you mind
if I come by

16:28.788 --> 16:31.622
if I have any more questions
about my technique?

16:31.658 --> 16:33.825
Well, I don't really coach
at that elite level,

16:33.860 --> 16:35.827
but if you would like,

16:35.862 --> 16:37.962
you could just
stop by the bunny hill,

16:37.998 --> 16:39.075
and I'll give you
a few pointers.

16:39.099 --> 16:40.465
Yeah, yeah.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.699
Great, thanks.

16:41.735 --> 16:42.735
Nice to meet you.

16:42.769 --> 16:44.402
Bye!

16:44.437 --> 16:46.337
Can you believe that?
Kat Miller?

16:46.373 --> 16:47.872
Yeah.

16:56.916 --> 17:00.385
Okay, now that we've learned
how to balance on our skis,

17:00.420 --> 17:01.652
I have one important question.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.087
Who here likes pizza?

17:03.123 --> 17:04.155
Me!

17:04.958 --> 17:07.525
Yes! Me too!

17:07.560 --> 17:09.359
Okay, so you just think
about pizza.

17:09.396 --> 17:11.162
You got a pizza slice
right here, like that.

17:11.196 --> 17:13.931
Point your skis down,

17:13.967 --> 17:15.165
shaped just like a pizza,

17:15.201 --> 17:16.201
and you stop!

17:16.236 --> 17:18.269
Just think about pizza.

17:18.304 --> 17:19.337
Pizza...

17:19.372 --> 17:20.505
pizza...

17:20.540 --> 17:21.939
And stop. Okay?

17:21.974 --> 17:23.741
Come on, Lauren,
I want you to try.

17:26.311 --> 17:27.845
There you go.

17:27.881 --> 17:28.881
See?
Perfect.

17:28.915 --> 17:29.714
Excellent.

17:29.749 --> 17:31.049
Stop.

17:31.084 --> 17:32.016
Whoa!

17:32.052 --> 17:33.052
Oh, wait, wait...

17:35.055 --> 17:36.587
Oh, my gosh.

17:36.623 --> 17:37.789
Whoa! Whoa!

17:37.824 --> 17:38.824
Whoa!

17:41.761 --> 17:42.560
I'm good still!

17:42.595 --> 17:43.261
Are you all right?

17:43.296 --> 17:44.407
Yeah, totally good,
thank you.

17:44.431 --> 17:45.696
Oh!

17:45.732 --> 17:46.531
I'll take this!

17:46.566 --> 17:48.046
I'll put it
at the bottom of the hill!

17:57.744 --> 17:59.710
Hey... Hey, sorry
about earlier.

17:59.746 --> 18:00.912
It's my new skis

18:00.947 --> 18:02.280
coupled with, uh,
the altitude,

18:02.315 --> 18:05.116
and my complete inability
to actually ski.

18:06.086 --> 18:07.718
Yeah, well, it happens
to the best of us.

18:08.521 --> 18:09.632
Have you tried
the cocoa here?

18:09.656 --> 18:10.555
It's really good.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.123
Thank you.

18:12.158 --> 18:12.924
I'm living proof

18:12.959 --> 18:15.059
that skiing ability
is not genetic.

18:15.095 --> 18:16.160
Oh, well,

18:16.196 --> 18:17.995
there's always room
in my bunny class.

18:19.032 --> 18:20.398
May I?

18:20.433 --> 18:22.066
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

18:23.670 --> 18:25.236
Anna told me about
your racing career.

18:25.271 --> 18:26.504
Very impressive.

18:26.539 --> 18:28.139
Oh, that's
ancient history.

18:28.174 --> 18:29.907
I don't compete
anymore.

18:29.943 --> 18:32.577
Well, you made a huge
impression on her.

18:32.612 --> 18:33.478
Can I join you?

18:33.513 --> 18:35.079
Sure.

18:35.115 --> 18:36.447
Thank you.

18:37.517 --> 18:39.016
Anna's only 15,

18:39.052 --> 18:41.285
but she has her eyes set
on Junior Nationals.

18:41.321 --> 18:42.186
She's so driven.

18:42.222 --> 18:43.855
She's the one
who wanted to come here

18:43.890 --> 18:46.090
and train with the great
Maddy Morrison.

18:46.126 --> 18:47.458
I really hope
that works out.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.327
Are you going back
on the slopes again today?

18:49.362 --> 18:50.606
'Cause, uh, I gotta keep
my guard up.

18:52.232 --> 18:53.965
No, no, I have other business
to attend to,

18:54.000 --> 18:55.533
so you're safe.

18:55.568 --> 18:56.434
Good.

18:57.470 --> 18:58.703
Work calls, huh?

18:58.738 --> 19:00.371
No, something more important,

19:00.406 --> 19:01.672
mending a lucky sweater.

19:01.708 --> 19:02.840
Oh.

19:02.876 --> 19:04.153
As a single dad
I wear many hats.

19:04.177 --> 19:05.610
I can mend a sweater,

19:05.645 --> 19:07.623
make blueberry pancakes,
and be on a conference call,

19:07.647 --> 19:08.647
simultaneously.

19:08.681 --> 19:10.548
That's pretty impressive.

19:10.583 --> 19:11.849
There's
my superstar now.

19:11.885 --> 19:13.784
Hey, are you done already?

19:13.820 --> 19:15.720
Uh, no, just
a 15-minute break.

19:15.755 --> 19:16.654
Hi, Anna.

19:16.689 --> 19:17.689
Hi.

19:17.724 --> 19:18.990
How's it going?

19:19.025 --> 19:20.158
Uh, it's, um...

19:20.193 --> 19:21.125
a little bumpy.

19:21.161 --> 19:22.538
I'm just quite
used to the slopes here yet.

19:22.562 --> 19:24.462
Yeah, skiing gates,

19:24.497 --> 19:25.863
it's all about rhythm,
you know?

19:25.899 --> 19:27.365
It's kind of like a dance.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.567
You know what helps me
is music.

19:29.602 --> 19:31.569
Visualize your turns
to the beat.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.871
Thank you.

19:33.907 --> 19:35.573
I should get back
to class now,

19:35.608 --> 19:37.675
but I'm done with Maddy
tomorrow at 2:00.

19:37.710 --> 19:38.576
Do you think maybe

19:38.611 --> 19:39.855
you could show me
a few things afterwards?

19:39.879 --> 19:41.212
I'd love to, but...

19:41.247 --> 19:43.047
I just do
the bunny hill.

19:43.082 --> 19:43.781
Well, the advice
you've given her

19:43.816 --> 19:44.860
has already changed her skiing.

19:44.884 --> 19:46.017
It really has.

19:46.052 --> 19:48.219
I'm really flattered,

19:48.254 --> 19:50.354
but I just don't think
it's a good idea.

19:50.390 --> 19:53.024
Okay, well, I should
get back to the slopes.

19:53.059 --> 19:53.891
All right,
you've got this.

19:53.927 --> 19:55.393
Go get 'em, honey.

19:55.428 --> 19:56.428
All right.

19:56.462 --> 19:57.662
Oh, wait, lip balm.

19:57.697 --> 19:58.729
Boom.

19:58.765 --> 20:00.097
- Thanks.
- That was quick.

20:00.133 --> 20:01.766
Yeah.

20:01.801 --> 20:03.568
Lip balm, sunscreen,
hand-warmers,

20:03.603 --> 20:04.702
I'm ready for everything.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.003
Clearly.

20:06.039 --> 20:07.838
Well, I gotta
get back to work, too.

20:07.874 --> 20:10.274
I've got a Winterfest
to wrangle, and...

20:10.310 --> 20:11.609
I wear a lot of hats, too.

20:12.712 --> 20:13.611
Thanks for this.

20:13.646 --> 20:14.912
Thank you.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.251
So, who was that

20:20.286 --> 20:21.786
I saw you dining with

20:21.821 --> 20:24.055
at our fine cafeteria
establishment?

20:24.090 --> 20:25.289
Oh, Ty.

20:25.325 --> 20:27.225
He's an advertising guy
from New York.

20:27.260 --> 20:28.559
He's here
with his daughter.

20:28.595 --> 20:30.027
They were just asking me

20:30.063 --> 20:31.529
if I could give her
a few pointers,

20:31.564 --> 20:32.597
and, you know...

20:32.632 --> 20:35.233
She's really a great skier.

20:35.268 --> 20:36.100
That's great.

20:36.135 --> 20:37.702
I think I've seen her
on the slopes.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.904
Oh, I'm not...
I'm not going to.

20:39.939 --> 20:41.305
She's here for Maddy.

20:41.341 --> 20:42.341
Oh, well, we all know

20:42.375 --> 20:44.575
that Maddy's a pretty
hard coach on her kids.

20:44.611 --> 20:45.876
Well, she's a real coach.

20:45.912 --> 20:48.145
And you have
real-life experience.

20:48.181 --> 20:49.614
Yeah, too many memories, too.

20:49.649 --> 20:51.115
You know what, Kat,

20:51.150 --> 20:52.328
you've just gotta
get out there,

20:52.352 --> 20:54.652
start taking chances again.

20:54.687 --> 20:56.120
I'm pretty happy
the way things are.

20:57.824 --> 20:59.257
I was just up at Epic.

20:59.292 --> 21:00.292
Look what I found.

21:02.595 --> 21:03.461
"A light show,

21:03.496 --> 21:05.730
"celebrity appearances,

21:05.765 --> 21:07.632
and gourmet chefs
cooking on the street."

21:07.667 --> 21:09.433
How can Winterfest
compete with that?

21:09.469 --> 21:10.334
We're totally out-matched.

21:10.370 --> 21:13.604
Epic has a massive
advertising budget.

21:13.640 --> 21:14.972
I mean, we can't compete.

21:19.012 --> 21:21.178
Or maybe we can.

21:21.214 --> 21:22.780
I might know someone
who could help.

21:42.769 --> 21:44.035
Hi.

21:44.070 --> 21:45.202
Kat, hi!

21:45.238 --> 21:46.771
This is a nice surprise.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.939
Yeah. I've given it
some thought,

21:48.975 --> 21:50.741
and I can give Anna
a lesson tomorrow,

21:50.777 --> 21:52.576
but not for any pay.

21:52.612 --> 21:54.612
In exchange for
some business advice?

21:55.815 --> 21:57.415
All right,
what did you have in mind?

21:57.450 --> 21:59.717
Well, I had
the brilliant idea

21:59.752 --> 22:01.952
of becoming the organizer
of the Winterfest this year,

22:01.988 --> 22:04.155
and I'm in way over my head.

22:04.190 --> 22:06.424
So, how can I help?

22:06.459 --> 22:09.393
Well, if I could just
pick your marketing brain

22:09.429 --> 22:12.229
on a way to get this event
to just snowball.

22:12.265 --> 22:13.097
What do you think?

22:13.132 --> 22:14.865
I think I'm in.

22:16.969 --> 22:17.969
Thank you.

22:27.380 --> 22:28.112
Hey...

22:28.147 --> 22:29.780
ready to do
a little coaching?

22:29.816 --> 22:31.849
Is it that obvious
I'm nervous?

22:31.884 --> 22:32.850
Just relax.

22:32.885 --> 22:35.286
If you need a rescue,
I'm just a call away.

22:35.321 --> 22:36.287
Wish me luck.

22:37.490 --> 22:38.823
All right, Anna!

22:40.393 --> 22:42.193
You ready to hit the slopes?

22:42.228 --> 22:43.194
You bet!

22:43.229 --> 22:44.195
All right.

22:44.230 --> 22:45.730
You bet!

22:46.966 --> 22:49.300
How do these binding
things work again?

22:49.335 --> 22:50.968
Uh...

22:51.003 --> 22:52.181
Why don't you meet us
at the lodge in a couple hours?

22:52.205 --> 22:52.903
I was hoping to, uh,

22:52.939 --> 22:54.505
to come up there
with you guys,

22:54.540 --> 22:55.617
see what you've got
up your sleeve.

22:55.641 --> 22:56.641
I guess.

22:56.676 --> 22:57.842
If you can keep up.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.810
Absolutely!

23:07.920 --> 23:08.686
There we go.

23:08.721 --> 23:10.554
Now, what are we
gonna work on first?

23:10.590 --> 23:13.290
Uh, exploding
out of the gate?

23:13.326 --> 23:15.626
Or, uh, angle of attack
on the turns?

23:15.661 --> 23:17.728
Uh... you know,
tucking in...

23:17.764 --> 23:19.330
being in the crouch?

23:19.365 --> 23:20.798
Not exactly.

23:22.201 --> 23:23.401
Marshmallows?

23:23.436 --> 23:24.702
Yeah.

23:24.737 --> 23:27.438
Something I thought up
for Anna.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.343
Interesting.

23:34.447 --> 23:37.014
Okay, Anna, when I say go,

23:37.049 --> 23:38.549
when you ski down the hill,

23:38.584 --> 23:40.718
I want you to stab
as many marshmallows as you can

23:40.753 --> 23:42.520
with your poles!

23:42.555 --> 23:43.888
- Ooh!
- Whoa!

23:43.923 --> 23:45.156
- Hey.
- Hi.

23:45.191 --> 23:47.057
What exactly
does that accomplish?

23:47.093 --> 23:49.059
Anna needs to use
her pole plant

23:49.095 --> 23:50.861
to initiate her turns,

23:50.897 --> 23:52.930
and then trust her edges.

23:52.965 --> 23:55.566
And you mix marshmallows
and training, it's fun.

23:55.601 --> 23:57.668
Did your coach
teach you that?

23:57.703 --> 24:00.104
Uh, the opposite,
actually.

24:00.139 --> 24:01.839
Well, then why...
Why would...

24:01.874 --> 24:03.441
Would it be okay if...

24:03.476 --> 24:06.844
You know...
the backseat coaching?

24:06.879 --> 24:08.090
I'm sorry,
I get overzealous because...

24:08.114 --> 24:09.280
No, it's okay,

24:09.315 --> 24:11.093
It's just maybe we could have
a little bit of girl time?

24:11.117 --> 24:12.516
Okay, okay, sure.

24:12.552 --> 24:13.951
Trust me, everything
will be okay.

24:13.986 --> 24:15.586
All right, I'll go
have some cocoa.

24:15.621 --> 24:17.388
Okay, Anna, go ahead!

24:23.296 --> 24:24.296
Good try!

24:26.399 --> 24:27.898
Just missed it.

24:27.934 --> 24:28.966
Almost.

24:29.001 --> 24:31.035
We'll work on that.

24:54.861 --> 24:55.861
Awesome.

24:56.929 --> 24:57.929
Way better.

25:01.334 --> 25:02.633
Ha!

25:02.668 --> 25:03.767
I got three this time!

25:03.803 --> 25:04.935
Look at that.

25:06.272 --> 25:07.938
Wow, your turns
are looking sharp.

25:07.974 --> 25:09.473
Thanks.

25:09.509 --> 25:10.586
What do you say,
we take a breather?

25:10.610 --> 25:12.276
Yeah.

25:12.311 --> 25:13.410
All right.

25:13.446 --> 25:14.979
You think we should
check on my Dad?

25:15.014 --> 25:16.080
He's probably okay.

25:16.115 --> 25:18.482
You know,
he's down at the lodge,

25:18.518 --> 25:19.283
drinking too much...

25:19.318 --> 25:20.784
Cocoa.

25:21.854 --> 25:22.854
My dad means well,

25:22.889 --> 25:24.288
but I think if he had his way,

25:24.323 --> 25:26.757
he'd be skiing
10 feet behind me all the time

25:26.792 --> 25:28.192
to make sure I'm safe.

25:28.227 --> 25:30.027
So how long
have you been skiing?

25:30.062 --> 25:31.062
Since I was little.

25:31.097 --> 25:33.163
We used to take
lots of family ski vacations.

25:33.199 --> 25:35.332
My mom's family
is from Vermont.

25:35.368 --> 25:36.267
Yeah, I was always the one

25:36.302 --> 25:38.135
that wanted to stay behind
in ski school

25:38.170 --> 25:40.115
when the rest of the kids
had gone back to the lodge.

25:40.139 --> 25:42.039
Yeah, I can relate.

25:42.074 --> 25:43.218
And now I'm in
the Youth Ski League,

25:43.242 --> 25:44.642
and we're traveling so much,

25:44.677 --> 25:45.609
and Dad can't really make it
'cause of work,

25:45.645 --> 25:47.645
you know?

25:47.680 --> 25:48.991
So it's great that we get
to have this week together.

25:49.015 --> 25:50.948
Yeah.

25:50.983 --> 25:52.361
You know what,
the wind's starting to blow.

25:52.385 --> 25:53.729
Maybe we should head back
to the lodge

25:53.753 --> 25:55.330
and roast up some
of these spare marshmallows.

25:55.354 --> 25:56.820
- What do you say?
- Yeah.

25:56.856 --> 25:57.856
Race you back?

25:57.890 --> 25:59.023
You're on.

26:01.661 --> 26:02.661
Let's go!

26:05.164 --> 26:07.164
You can't get
ahead of me!

26:19.745 --> 26:20.745
Hey!

26:20.780 --> 26:22.079
How'd it go?

26:22.114 --> 26:23.914
It was intense,
but surprisingly fun.

26:23.950 --> 26:24.882
All right.

26:24.917 --> 26:26.483
Yeah, she was great.

26:26.519 --> 26:27.529
She's really starting
to trust her edge

26:27.553 --> 26:28.586
on her turns.

26:28.621 --> 26:30.654
So the marshmallows worked.

26:30.690 --> 26:32.601
I had a feeling things went
pretty good out there.

26:32.625 --> 26:34.091
Hey, Kat, do you think

26:34.126 --> 26:35.270
we could do this again tomorrow?

26:35.294 --> 26:36.327
What about
Maddy's class?

26:36.362 --> 26:38.106
You came all the way
across the country for her.

26:38.130 --> 26:40.364
I came here
to improve my skiing,

26:40.399 --> 26:41.944
and things are really
starting to click with you.

26:41.968 --> 26:42.833
I mean,

26:42.868 --> 26:46.403
I am up to my neck
in Winterfest stuff.

26:46.439 --> 26:48.539
Maybe you guys could
help decorate, and help...

26:48.574 --> 26:50.541
Absolutely, yes.

26:50.576 --> 26:52.176
Yeah, totally.
Thank you so much, Kat!

26:52.211 --> 26:53.944
And, uh, tomorrow,
do you think

26:53.980 --> 26:55.057
we could work a little
on my form?

26:55.081 --> 26:57.581
Absolutely.
We're on.

26:57.617 --> 26:58.617
Wow.

26:58.651 --> 26:59.717
Hey, Anna...

26:59.752 --> 27:00.762
come on over for some cocoa.

27:00.786 --> 27:01.685
Yeah, totally.

27:01.721 --> 27:02.920
All right.

27:04.457 --> 27:05.422
Well, that's good.

27:05.458 --> 27:06.458
Yes.

27:06.492 --> 27:08.592
How is it
that your daughter

27:08.628 --> 27:10.594
talks me into
absolutely anything?

27:10.630 --> 27:11.990
Well,
welcome to my world.

27:13.432 --> 27:15.265
By the way,
I didn't forget

27:15.301 --> 27:17.301
about my end
of our little bargain.

27:17.336 --> 27:18.769
Do you know
that Bliss Valley

27:18.804 --> 27:20.604
has almost
no online presence?

27:20.640 --> 27:21.939
I mean, I reached out

27:21.974 --> 27:22.740
to some of
my marketing friends,

27:22.775 --> 27:23.641
and put some information
out there,

27:23.676 --> 27:24.720
started a little
social media campaign...

27:24.744 --> 27:26.644
Would you like to go
on a little mission with me

27:26.679 --> 27:27.778
into town?

27:27.813 --> 27:29.157
I've got to drop off some boxes
to the fire station.

27:29.181 --> 27:30.381
Yeah, yeah,

27:30.416 --> 27:32.056
I could get an insider's
view of the town.

27:32.084 --> 27:33.050
Yeah.

27:33.085 --> 27:34.184
Mm-hmm.

27:37.023 --> 27:39.423
Oh, wow,
look at this theater.

27:39.458 --> 27:40.958
- 1945?
- Yeah.

27:40.993 --> 27:42.893
Hey, that
looks good, Tony!

27:42.928 --> 27:44.161
Lookin' good, Tony!

27:44.196 --> 27:45.796
Hey, what's, uh...

27:45.831 --> 27:47.398
What's in these
old boxes, anyway?

27:47.433 --> 27:48.832
Oh, there's a dozen
wand lighters,

27:48.868 --> 27:51.301
and a whole lot of torches.

27:51.337 --> 27:52.269
I want the firefighters
to light 'em,

27:52.304 --> 27:53.604
not a volunteer,
you know?

27:53.639 --> 27:55.906
Yeah, that makes
good sense.

27:55.941 --> 27:58.676
Well, this place doesn't
have the energy of New York,

27:58.711 --> 28:00.310
but I guess
that's the charm.

28:00.346 --> 28:01.278
That's the appeal.

28:01.313 --> 28:02.179
Mm-hmm.

28:02.214 --> 28:04.948
I've got some, uh,
marketing brainstorming

28:04.984 --> 28:06.450
going on in here
right now.

28:06.485 --> 28:07.785
Okay...

28:07.820 --> 28:08.820
And you grew up here?

28:08.854 --> 28:10.954
Uh, yeah,
I was born here.

28:10.990 --> 28:12.856
I'm a mountain girl.

28:12.892 --> 28:13.991
But I did go off
to college,

28:14.026 --> 28:15.259
and I toured
all over the world

28:15.294 --> 28:16.326
in competition,

28:16.362 --> 28:18.095
but I ended up
coming back here

28:18.130 --> 28:19.296
because it's home.

28:19.331 --> 28:21.432
It's a nice home.

28:21.467 --> 28:22.666
Yeah, it is.

28:22.702 --> 28:24.835
And the thing
about Bliss is,

28:24.870 --> 28:27.171
our skiing is better
than Epic,

28:27.206 --> 28:28.472
and nobody knows it.

28:28.507 --> 28:29.673
We'll they're gonna know.

28:29.709 --> 28:32.643
Bliss is a hidden gem,

28:32.678 --> 28:34.378
with the best snow around.

28:34.413 --> 28:37.614
It's warm, quirky,
inviting.

28:37.650 --> 28:40.284
It's the best kept secret
in the West.

28:40.319 --> 28:41.385
Mm-hmm.

28:41.420 --> 28:43.620
There's a reason
they call it "Bliss."

28:43.656 --> 28:44.855
How's that sound?

28:44.890 --> 28:46.790
Oh, that sounds good.

28:47.860 --> 28:49.727
Look at this.

28:49.762 --> 28:52.830
I mean, ice sculpting
in the park, fires...?

28:52.865 --> 28:55.232
You don't find that
at any cookie-cutter resort.

28:55.267 --> 28:57.034
This place is special.

28:57.069 --> 29:00.471
Okay, so, I've seen the town,
I've seen the resort.

29:00.506 --> 29:03.841
Where's the best restaurant
in town, the best food?

29:03.876 --> 29:05.509
Oh, the Mountain View Grill.

29:05.544 --> 29:08.812
It's up at the resort,
but it's the best restaurant.

29:08.848 --> 29:10.714
Okay, what makes it
so special?

29:10.750 --> 29:13.150
Well, it wouldn't be
the decor or the architecture,

29:13.185 --> 29:14.051
that's for sure,

29:14.086 --> 29:16.420
but they have
a really creative menu,

29:16.455 --> 29:19.022
and it's got a good vibe,
you know?

29:19.058 --> 29:21.024
Okay, sold. I'm in.

29:21.060 --> 29:24.361
I mean, I can't do all this
thinking and brainstorming

29:24.396 --> 29:26.330
and marketing
on an empty stomach, right?

29:26.365 --> 29:27.531
True.

29:27.566 --> 29:30.367
So, uh, should we
head up there tonight?

29:30.402 --> 29:31.335
My treat?

29:31.370 --> 29:32.936
Tonight?

29:32.972 --> 29:33.937
Yeah.

29:33.973 --> 29:34.938
Oh, uh...

29:34.974 --> 29:36.440
Okay.

29:36.475 --> 29:37.508
All right.

29:37.543 --> 29:38.342
All right.

29:38.377 --> 29:40.544
Come on, let's go
drop these off.

29:40.579 --> 29:41.590
Yeah, this is getting
kind of heavy.

29:41.614 --> 29:42.654
I was gonna say something.

29:47.186 --> 29:48.886
So, are you ready
for your date?

29:48.921 --> 29:51.088
It's not a date,
it's business.

29:51.123 --> 29:52.556
I'm just not sure
about this dress.

29:52.591 --> 29:53.631
Well, come out,
let us see.

29:57.730 --> 29:58.829
Hey, you look
amazing.

29:58.864 --> 30:00.697
Oh, I don't know.

30:00.733 --> 30:02.099
Aw, it's just 'cause

30:02.134 --> 30:03.934
you're used to
wearing ski pants.

30:03.969 --> 30:05.536
Excuse me?

30:05.571 --> 30:08.105
Kat, emerald is definitely
your color,

30:08.140 --> 30:10.908
and you have always
been my gem.

30:10.943 --> 30:12.409
Oh, Pops, that's cute.

30:13.813 --> 30:16.013
You look beautiful,
sweetheart.

30:16.048 --> 30:17.581
Aw, thank you so much.

30:17.616 --> 30:19.216
See you later.

30:19.251 --> 30:20.417
Have fun
on your date.

30:20.452 --> 30:21.652
It's not a date!

30:22.621 --> 30:23.754
It's a date.

30:23.789 --> 30:25.255
Yeah.

30:26.492 --> 30:27.591
Where is Anna?

30:27.626 --> 30:29.193
Uh, well,
she made friends

30:29.228 --> 30:30.639
with some of the other
girls in the hotel,

30:30.663 --> 30:33.063
so they're having
a camp-in tonight.

30:33.098 --> 30:34.431
A "camp-in"?

30:34.466 --> 30:36.066
It's the opposite
of a camp-out.

30:36.101 --> 30:37.734
They're roasting
marshmallows

30:37.770 --> 30:39.136
in the hotel
lobby fireplace.

30:39.171 --> 30:40.103
Ah.

30:40.139 --> 30:41.405
It's a new thing.

30:42.675 --> 30:44.074
It sounds fun.

30:44.109 --> 30:45.075
I'll be right back.

30:45.110 --> 30:46.743
All right.

30:46.779 --> 30:48.111
Wow.

30:48.147 --> 30:50.280
You're right,

30:50.316 --> 30:51.748
this town
has lots of character.

30:51.784 --> 30:53.417
Wait until you see it
on Saturday night,

30:53.452 --> 30:55.219
when we have a torchlight
parade of skiers

30:55.254 --> 30:57.988
just coming down
that mountain.

30:58.023 --> 30:59.568
Well, that is something
I definitely want to see.

30:59.592 --> 31:01.892
I've got a funny feeling
I'm not the only one.

31:01.927 --> 31:04.461
I called a couple
of Denver TV stations,

31:04.496 --> 31:06.408
and asked them if they'd be
interested in covering

31:06.432 --> 31:08.265
the 50th anniversary
of Winterfest,

31:08.300 --> 31:09.166
and they seemed interested.

31:09.201 --> 31:10.133
Thank you.

31:10.169 --> 31:11.929
That's a great idea.

31:12.972 --> 31:13.770
Ah...

31:13.806 --> 31:16.273
They're hashtagging
their camp-in.

31:16.308 --> 31:18.675
♪ LivinglnBliss.

31:18.711 --> 31:19.543
That's actually pretty good.

31:19.578 --> 31:22.112
I think I might
have to borrow that one.

31:22.147 --> 31:23.680
That's a chip
off the old block.

31:23.716 --> 31:26.083
Wow, 400 followers
already?

31:26.118 --> 31:28.919
That's a really good way
to get the word out.

31:28.954 --> 31:32.656
Ask her if she can hashtag
"Heart Of The Mountain"

31:32.691 --> 31:33.624
and "Winterfest."

31:33.659 --> 31:34.659
All right.

31:35.794 --> 31:37.094
It makes me so happy

31:37.129 --> 31:39.529
to see her
having fun with friends.

31:39.565 --> 31:41.765
You know, she's gone
a lot, racing,

31:41.800 --> 31:43.545
and she doesn't have
a whole lot of down time,

31:43.569 --> 31:44.835
and making friends is just...

31:44.870 --> 31:45.936
I get that.

31:45.971 --> 31:46.803
The junior racers,

31:46.839 --> 31:49.640
they just don't have
a typical life.

31:49.675 --> 31:52.209
And Anna is not a typical girl.

31:52.244 --> 31:53.310
She's fierce.

31:53.345 --> 31:54.511
Yeah.

31:54.546 --> 31:57.614
Well, it takes drive

31:57.650 --> 31:58.815
to be a champion.

31:58.851 --> 31:59.983
And a driver.

32:00.019 --> 32:01.285
Driver.

32:01.320 --> 32:02.286
True.

32:03.322 --> 32:04.322
True...

32:04.356 --> 32:06.323
But she's got the desire,
she's got the talent.

32:06.358 --> 32:07.991
She just needs
the guidance,

32:08.027 --> 32:10.627
you know?

32:10.663 --> 32:13.697
You've raised
a really awesome girl.

32:14.767 --> 32:15.732
Thank you.

32:15.768 --> 32:17.668
To be honest,

32:17.703 --> 32:19.214
I feel like I'm out of my depth
most of the time.

32:19.238 --> 32:20.370
I mean, being a single dad

32:20.406 --> 32:22.306
and working,

32:22.341 --> 32:23.640
and juggling all that,

32:23.676 --> 32:27.077
we don't really get the...
the quality time.

32:27.112 --> 32:28.679
Well, you're doing
something right,

32:28.714 --> 32:29.714
that's for sure.

32:32.451 --> 32:36.386
Anna's Mom loved to ski,

32:36.422 --> 32:39.723
and I think that's
part of her passion.

32:39.758 --> 32:42.526
It was really hard on her
to lose her mom.

32:42.561 --> 32:43.601
It was hard on both of us.

32:43.629 --> 32:45.395
I don't know,
her skiing

32:45.431 --> 32:47.164
is something
we can connect on,

32:47.199 --> 32:48.031
so I encourage that

32:48.067 --> 32:49.333
whenever I can,

32:49.368 --> 32:51.501
even when it scares
the daylights out of me,

32:51.537 --> 32:52.502
and it does.

32:52.538 --> 32:53.670
Yeah, I know.

32:53.706 --> 32:55.572
But you know,

32:55.607 --> 33:01.044
maybe if you relaxed
a little bit,

33:01.080 --> 33:03.347
then that might help her
to relax a little bit.

33:03.382 --> 33:05.849
I know, I'm a little
overzealous sometimes,

33:05.884 --> 33:07.117
but honestly,

33:07.152 --> 33:09.953
your innovatively
fun approach to training,

33:09.989 --> 33:11.788
that really,
really is working for her.

33:11.824 --> 33:12.856
Well, I mean,
you know,

33:12.891 --> 33:14.291
people don't realize

33:14.326 --> 33:16.760
how much pressure
athletes put on themselves.

33:16.795 --> 33:20.597
You know, and a good coach
can focus that intensity,

33:20.632 --> 33:22.866
whereas the wrong coach

33:22.901 --> 33:26.203
can just make it
completely overwhelming.

33:26.238 --> 33:27.871
That sounds kind of personal.

33:29.842 --> 33:31.975
Yeah, it's a long story,

33:32.011 --> 33:34.778
which ended up with me
giving up racing

33:34.813 --> 33:36.279
and moving back home.

33:36.315 --> 33:37.914
Nobody
judges me here,

33:37.950 --> 33:40.717
and I can be around

33:40.753 --> 33:43.120
the people
and the mountain that I love.

33:43.155 --> 33:45.122
Do you ever miss it?

33:45.157 --> 33:47.124
Like, putting yourself
out there?

33:47.159 --> 33:49.059
Yeah, I do.

33:49.094 --> 33:51.495
But I think the thing
that I miss the most

33:51.530 --> 33:54.131
is just...

33:54.166 --> 33:55.632
being on a team.

33:55.667 --> 33:58.101
That's probably
why I stepped up

33:58.137 --> 34:01.338
to be the chair of
the Winterfest Committee,

34:01.373 --> 34:03.640
'cause this town
is like my family,

34:03.675 --> 34:05.275
and family...

34:05.310 --> 34:06.410
supports one another.

34:08.013 --> 34:10.580
Now it's all on me
to save it.

34:10.616 --> 34:11.514
Not all on you.

34:11.550 --> 34:12.649
On us.

34:12.684 --> 34:14.650
Remember? Our deal?

34:14.686 --> 34:16.152
We're a team now.

34:18.357 --> 34:19.523
Compliments of the house?

34:19.558 --> 34:20.456
Oh, wow.

34:20.492 --> 34:21.425
Thank you.

34:21.460 --> 34:22.460
Enjoy.

34:24.630 --> 34:26.763
To...

34:26.799 --> 34:28.098
new beginnings.

34:34.840 --> 34:37.940
Okay, that dinner
was fantastic.

34:37.976 --> 34:38.842
Yeah?

34:38.877 --> 34:39.976
Yeah, five stars.

34:40.012 --> 34:41.043
I told you, it's great.

34:41.080 --> 34:42.946
And then Yuri
with the violin?

34:42.981 --> 34:44.014
I mean, who knew?

34:44.049 --> 34:46.116
Oh, well, I mean,
it's got character, that place.

34:46.150 --> 34:47.551
Yes.

34:47.585 --> 34:49.386
Kat?

34:49.420 --> 34:50.387
Oh, Maddy!

34:50.422 --> 34:52.856
Uh, we were just having
dinner at the Grill.

34:52.891 --> 34:53.723
Oh, we're just
heading there now.

34:53.759 --> 34:56.025
So, I heard you've
started coaching now?

34:56.061 --> 34:57.027
Just one student.

34:57.062 --> 34:58.528
My student.

34:58.564 --> 35:00.163
But I think my class
may have been

35:00.199 --> 35:01.509
a little too much
pressure for her.

35:01.533 --> 35:02.866
Uh...

35:02.901 --> 35:04.201
I don't know
about that,

35:04.236 --> 35:05.836
but I just hope
you don't mind.

35:05.871 --> 35:07.037
Oh, of course not.

35:07.072 --> 35:08.538
Whatever's best
for Anna.

35:08.574 --> 35:09.739
Thank you.

35:09.775 --> 35:11.675
Kat Miller?

35:11.710 --> 35:12.676
Derek?

35:12.711 --> 35:13.643
Oh, my gosh.

35:13.679 --> 35:14.845
Wow.

35:14.880 --> 35:16.746
We used to be
on the U.S. Ski team.

35:16.782 --> 35:17.514
Oh, yeah.

35:17.549 --> 35:19.983
What brings you
to Bliss Valley?

35:20.018 --> 35:20.917
I work for
the Ski Federation now,

35:20.953 --> 35:21.985
and my colleagues and I,

35:22.020 --> 35:23.231
we were just
heading up to Epic,

35:23.255 --> 35:24.321
and when we heard

35:24.356 --> 35:25.555
Maddy Morrison
was in town,

35:25.591 --> 35:27.891
we thought we'd stop by
and say hi.

35:27.926 --> 35:29.204
Well, I hope you get a chance
to check out our little town.

35:29.228 --> 35:30.193
While you're here.

35:30.229 --> 35:31.428
Yeah, this place
is like

35:31.463 --> 35:32.829
the best-kept secret
in the West.

35:32.865 --> 35:33.930
Uh, my daughter and I,

35:33.966 --> 35:34.764
we flew all the way out
from New York

35:34.800 --> 35:36.099
to be here,

35:36.135 --> 35:37.734
and just between you and I,

35:37.769 --> 35:40.837
the snow here is a lot better
than it is at Epic.

35:40.873 --> 35:41.605
You should check it out.

35:41.640 --> 35:42.539
Yeah.

35:42.574 --> 35:43.540
I wish I could.

35:43.575 --> 35:44.674
Our schedule is so tight.

35:44.710 --> 35:45.575
We're considering Epic

35:45.611 --> 35:46.754
for the next year's
Junior Nationals.

35:46.778 --> 35:48.445
Epic, really?

35:48.480 --> 35:49.379
Yeah.

35:49.414 --> 35:50.925
We better not tell him
about Winterfest then.

35:50.949 --> 35:52.048
Winterfest,

35:52.084 --> 35:53.049
it's a big thing
they have here,

35:53.085 --> 35:54.117
this Saturday.

35:54.153 --> 35:56.953
Music, fireworks,
torchlight parade,

35:56.989 --> 35:59.055
and a big exhibition race,

35:59.091 --> 36:00.223
because you know,

36:00.259 --> 36:01.958
Bliss Mountain
makes champions,

36:01.994 --> 36:03.527
just like
these two right here.

36:03.562 --> 36:04.806
Yeah, Maddy's gonna
be there, too.

36:04.830 --> 36:05.862
I will.

36:05.898 --> 36:06.963
Aw, as much
as I'd love to,

36:06.999 --> 36:08.265
our time is so short.

36:08.300 --> 36:09.065
In any case,

36:09.101 --> 36:10.433
it was so good
to see you again.

36:10.469 --> 36:12.269
It's great to see you.

36:12.304 --> 36:13.036
Uh, you guys
have a good night.

36:13.071 --> 36:14.137
You too.

36:14.173 --> 36:15.972
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

36:16.008 --> 36:17.207
Are you kidding me?

36:17.242 --> 36:18.808
Junior Nationals?

36:18.844 --> 36:20.410
That would bring
tons of skiers here

36:20.445 --> 36:22.045
and so much publicity.

36:22.080 --> 36:23.547
Bliss deserves
a chance at that.

36:23.582 --> 36:25.382
I think we just
planted a seed, though.

36:25.417 --> 36:26.149
Yeah?

36:26.185 --> 36:28.318
10 to 1, he shows up
at Winterfest.

36:28.353 --> 36:29.586
You think?

36:29.621 --> 36:31.588
Bliss Valley
is back in the game.

36:31.623 --> 36:32.722
I hope so.

36:32.758 --> 36:33.924
I hope so.

36:39.264 --> 36:40.264
Hey.

36:40.299 --> 36:41.097
All ready for some training?

36:41.133 --> 36:42.332
Oh, yeah.

36:42.367 --> 36:44.100
Oh, yeah...
let's train.

36:44.136 --> 36:45.669
Okay.

36:45.704 --> 36:46.704
Uh... Dad?

36:48.006 --> 36:49.126
Oh, uh,
is it okay if I come?

36:51.210 --> 36:52.609
Sure, the more, the merrier.

36:53.679 --> 36:54.919
All right,
what's on the agenda?

36:54.947 --> 36:56.646
More marshmallows?

36:56.682 --> 36:57.581
Uh... I've got
something else in mind.

36:57.616 --> 36:58.616
Come on.

36:58.650 --> 36:59.650
All right.

37:04.723 --> 37:06.756
Okay.

37:08.327 --> 37:09.526
Hey, Kat,

37:09.561 --> 37:10.672
aren't those poles
supposed to be used

37:10.696 --> 37:12.128
up on the mountain?

37:12.164 --> 37:13.841
You gotta learn to walk
before you can run.

37:13.865 --> 37:15.632
Can you hold
her backpack?

37:15.667 --> 37:16.633
Oh, sure.

37:16.668 --> 37:18.101
All right, Anna,

37:18.136 --> 37:19.803
get that book out
of my backpack for me.

37:19.838 --> 37:20.704
Okay.

37:20.739 --> 37:22.839
All right.

37:22.874 --> 37:24.441
Anna, here's what
I want you to do.

37:24.476 --> 37:26.443
I want you to hold
the book out like this.

37:26.478 --> 37:27.377
Okay.

37:27.412 --> 37:28.645
With your arms
tucked in

37:28.680 --> 37:30.213
like you're reading it.

37:30.249 --> 37:31.481
Right.

37:31.516 --> 37:32.649
Like this?

37:32.684 --> 37:33.717
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

37:33.752 --> 37:35.385
Like you're
reading it.

37:35.420 --> 37:36.798
But what does this
have to do with skiing?

37:36.822 --> 37:37.687
I might have
another book in there

37:37.723 --> 37:38.688
for patience?

37:38.724 --> 37:39.789
You wanna borrow it?

37:39.825 --> 37:41.558
Ah, no.

37:41.593 --> 37:44.527
All of this actually does
serve a purpose, okay?

37:44.563 --> 37:46.496
Keep your hands out.

37:46.531 --> 37:47.797
Hold that for me.

37:47.833 --> 37:48.598
All right, Anna,

37:48.634 --> 37:50.233
I want you to
hold onto your poles,

37:50.269 --> 37:52.335
just like you were
with the book.

37:52.371 --> 37:53.536
See them out there?

37:53.572 --> 37:55.839
Okay, your upper body is still,

37:55.874 --> 37:59.242
and your lower body
is feeling the turns.

37:59.278 --> 38:01.511
In your peripheral vision,
you see your poles,

38:01.546 --> 38:03.513
always looking two gates ahead,

38:03.548 --> 38:04.614
and reading the mountain.

38:06.351 --> 38:07.651
Add some music.

38:09.554 --> 38:11.488
And feel the beats...

38:11.523 --> 38:13.790
Okay?

38:15.027 --> 38:16.159
There,

38:16.194 --> 38:18.695
and now you're skiing
perfect slalom.

38:22.567 --> 38:24.067
You don't
need to do it.

38:24.102 --> 38:25.902
But I'm skiing
perfect slalom.

38:32.644 --> 38:33.810
Thanks f all this.

38:33.845 --> 38:34.678
It seems like
an awful lot of work

38:34.713 --> 38:36.579
for such a little race.

38:36.615 --> 38:38.493
It's an exhibition race,
and it's in a couple of days.

38:38.517 --> 38:40.116
Ah, this
takes me back.

38:40.152 --> 38:42.085
All the pre-race
preparations.

38:42.120 --> 38:44.821
It's exciting!

38:44.856 --> 38:46.990
Okay, stand
on those forward,

38:47.025 --> 38:48.191
and push
on the boots.

38:48.226 --> 38:49.092
How's that?

38:49.127 --> 38:50.960
Perfect.

38:50.996 --> 38:52.440
Hey, Kate is this you
in these pictures?

38:52.464 --> 38:54.864
Oh, that's her,
all right,

38:54.900 --> 38:56.666
back when she was
Anna's age or younger.

38:56.702 --> 38:58.435
You were
quite the competitor.

38:58.470 --> 39:00.503
Yeah, that was
a long time ago.

39:01.540 --> 39:02.540
Oh, hang on.

39:04.876 --> 39:06.276
Huh.

39:06.311 --> 39:07.677
Everything okay?

39:07.713 --> 39:09.112
It's the Mayor,

39:09.147 --> 39:10.191
he's calling for
an emergency meeting

39:10.215 --> 39:11.147
about Winterfest.

39:11.183 --> 39:12.682
Something's up.

39:12.718 --> 39:13.783
Will you
come with me?

39:13.819 --> 39:14.684
I'd love to.

39:14.720 --> 39:16.064
Okay, Dad, will you
take care of this?

39:16.088 --> 39:16.986
Sure.

39:17.022 --> 39:18.662
- We'll see you there, Lindsay.
- You bet.

39:30.168 --> 39:33.002
Your committee meets
at a picnic table?

39:33.038 --> 39:35.705
This is Bliss Valley,
not Manhattan.

39:35.741 --> 39:37.040
This is our City Hall.

39:38.276 --> 39:39.876
- Wow.
- What's going on?

39:39.911 --> 39:40.710
Oh, hey, Kat.

39:40.746 --> 39:41.789
Uh, well, I was just
telling everybody

39:41.813 --> 39:44.314
I've got some good news
and I've got some bad news.

39:44.349 --> 39:45.281
The good news,

39:45.317 --> 39:48.251
I got a call from
a TV station down in Denver,

39:48.286 --> 39:49.997
and they're gonna send up
a news crew tomorrow.

39:50.021 --> 39:51.221
That's great!

39:51.256 --> 39:52.333
And resort bookings are up.

39:52.357 --> 39:53.990
What's the bad news?

39:54.025 --> 39:56.092
Just one little thing.

39:56.128 --> 39:57.494
We may have
a full house,

39:57.529 --> 39:59.996
but dining is gonna be
a bit of a problem.

40:00.031 --> 40:01.142
Jasper, do you
wanna tell her?

40:01.166 --> 40:03.700
Yeah, the resort dining room
sprung a leak last night,

40:03.735 --> 40:05.602
so the place is a mess,

40:05.637 --> 40:06.669
carpets are a loss.

40:06.705 --> 40:08.438
I mean, folk'll need galoshes.

40:08.473 --> 40:09.839
Well, where's
everyone gonna eat?

40:09.875 --> 40:11.841
Well, the Grill
seats about 80 people,

40:11.877 --> 40:12.809
and even counting
the cafe and burger joint,

40:12.844 --> 40:15.412
we just can't handle
those kinds of crowds.

40:15.447 --> 40:17.614
I guess there's
restaurants up in Epic...

40:17.649 --> 40:18.693
We can let people
eat at Epic...

40:18.717 --> 40:20.383
Guys, guys,
we've got to think.

40:20.419 --> 40:21.851
We may not have
restaurants,

40:21.887 --> 40:24.387
but we've got to work
with what we do have.

40:24.423 --> 40:25.922
Jasper!

40:25.957 --> 40:28.458
Does your family still own
the barn behind the resort?

40:28.493 --> 40:30.193
Yeah.

40:30.228 --> 40:31.539
I mean, it's mostly
just for storage.

40:31.563 --> 40:32.807
We park the plows there
in the summer.

40:32.831 --> 40:34.898
But it's easy enough
to empty it out quickly?

40:34.933 --> 40:35.965
Well, yeah.

40:36.001 --> 40:37.100
But...

40:37.135 --> 40:40.069
What exactly
are you getting, at Kat?

40:40.105 --> 40:41.571
Just thinking outside the box.

40:48.013 --> 40:49.879
Wow, it's right
at the base of the mountain.

40:49.915 --> 40:50.747
It's beautiful.

40:50.782 --> 40:52.182
Yeah, this is gonna work.

40:53.285 --> 40:54.517
Here, come on.

41:01.426 --> 41:03.293
All right,
watch your heads, guys.

41:03.328 --> 41:04.328
Wow.

41:07.299 --> 41:08.299
Whoa-ho-ho...

41:08.333 --> 41:12.469
There's plenty of room in here
for food and fun.

41:12.504 --> 41:13.837
It's a Ski Barn.

41:13.872 --> 41:16.306
You know, you ski in
for a bite,

41:16.341 --> 41:17.674
and then
hit the slopes?

41:17.709 --> 41:18.975
We can have
a dance floor here,

41:19.010 --> 41:21.511
and put up
winter decorations.

41:21.546 --> 41:22.812
Uh, sounds great, Kat,

41:22.848 --> 41:24.147
but it's gonna
take some work.

41:24.182 --> 41:25.648
Hey, Mayor,
do you think

41:25.684 --> 41:28.518
you could speed up
some permits for us?

41:28.553 --> 41:31.955
Yeah, I think we could
probably do that.

41:31.990 --> 41:33.000
Well, what are we
waiting for, huh?

41:33.024 --> 41:34.190
Let's get to work.

41:34.226 --> 41:35.258
Let's do it!

41:35.293 --> 41:37.627
All right, cool.

41:42.968 --> 41:43.933
Ugh...

41:45.904 --> 41:49.806
♪ You won't give up
that easy, though ♪

41:49.841 --> 41:52.775
♪ You turn
to root a tree to grow ♪

41:52.811 --> 41:56.779
♪ Your ivy walls
can't keep me in ♪

41:56.815 --> 41:58.014
♪ I am a heart... ♪

41:58.049 --> 42:00.016
Hey!

42:00.051 --> 42:02.519
♪ ..That's hard to pin... ♪

42:04.222 --> 42:05.488
These ones?

42:05.524 --> 42:06.623
Yeah.

42:12.163 --> 42:13.163
You look amazing!

42:13.198 --> 42:14.797
Stop.

42:14.833 --> 42:15.833
That's beautiful.

42:18.436 --> 42:19.736
Oh, no, no.
You do look great.

42:19.771 --> 42:20.970
Are you gonna come?

42:21.006 --> 42:22.406
Uh, no, I'm really
happy right here.

42:23.375 --> 42:24.407
Are you serious?

42:24.442 --> 42:26.242
It does not look
like it's easy,

42:26.278 --> 42:28.211
and I don't have
that talent.

42:28.246 --> 42:29.312
Okay, wait.

42:31.016 --> 42:32.749
I got your back.

42:32.784 --> 42:34.217
All right,
I'll sit in a chair.

42:34.252 --> 42:36.085
No, you're gonna
push the chair.

42:36.121 --> 42:37.487
Oh.

42:37.522 --> 42:38.655
Okay.

42:38.690 --> 42:40.757
All right,
here we go,

42:40.792 --> 42:41.758
I'm doing it, honey!

42:41.793 --> 42:42.692
It's gonna
hold you.

42:42.727 --> 42:44.327
Okay.

42:44.362 --> 42:45.328
I'm on the ice.

42:45.363 --> 42:46.696
Yup.

42:46.731 --> 42:47.864
Oh, look at this.

42:47.899 --> 42:49.232
Here, we're going.

42:49.267 --> 42:50.267
Can you go this way?

42:50.302 --> 42:52.368
Whichever way you wanna go.

42:52.404 --> 42:53.903
Hey, I can do this.

42:53.939 --> 42:55.438
Yeah.

42:55.473 --> 42:56.606
I'm slow.

42:56.641 --> 42:57.707
You're doing great.

42:57.742 --> 42:58.708
I'm just walking.

42:58.743 --> 42:59.842
Got it?

42:59.878 --> 43:01.411
I'm skating!
I am skating.

43:01.446 --> 43:02.579
- You are!
- You're doing it!

43:02.614 --> 43:03.614
All right...

43:05.116 --> 43:07.283
Thank you.

43:07.319 --> 43:08.217
What do I do?

43:08.253 --> 43:09.352
Just come on.

43:09.387 --> 43:10.954
Okay...

43:15.093 --> 43:16.213
Very carefully.
Oh, this way.

43:25.837 --> 43:26.903
Let's thaw out
by the fire.

43:26.938 --> 43:27.837
Oh, excuse me,

43:27.872 --> 43:28.916
can we get two cups
of cocoa over here?

43:28.940 --> 43:30.073
Thank you.

43:32.110 --> 43:34.978
Thanks for everything, Ty.
It's really coming together.

43:35.013 --> 43:36.479
Just two days to go,

43:36.514 --> 43:37.880
and two days till Anna's race.

43:37.916 --> 43:39.716
It's just
an exhibition race.

43:39.751 --> 43:42.418
Same blood, sweat, and tears
goes into an exhibition race

43:42.454 --> 43:43.454
as any other.

43:44.756 --> 43:45.722
Oh...

43:45.757 --> 43:46.589
Oh, thank you.

43:46.625 --> 43:47.991
Thank you very much.

43:48.026 --> 43:49.559
Yes...

43:49.594 --> 43:51.561
Oh, I love
the cocoa so much.

43:56.101 --> 43:57.834
Hey, can I ask you a question?

43:57.869 --> 43:59.902
Mm-hmm.

43:59.938 --> 44:01.804
What happened, on that day,
at the Trials?

44:01.840 --> 44:03.740
Oh.

44:05.610 --> 44:08.077
Um, Maddy and I
shared the same coach.

44:08.113 --> 44:10.246
A tough one, I bet.

44:10.281 --> 44:11.848
Oh, tough as nails.

44:11.883 --> 44:13.416
He'd play us
against each other...

44:13.451 --> 44:16.319
Maddy really responded
to his approach,

44:16.354 --> 44:17.153
but I didn't.

44:17.188 --> 44:20.790
A great coach
brings out the best

44:20.825 --> 44:22.458
in every athlete,

44:22.494 --> 44:24.360
but his style

44:24.396 --> 44:26.129
didn't bring out my best,

44:26.164 --> 44:29.465
so when race day
finally arrived,

44:29.501 --> 44:31.034
I was a bundle of nerves,

44:31.069 --> 44:34.504
and the snow was perfect,

44:34.539 --> 44:37.840
and Maddy had just gotten
an amazing time,

44:37.876 --> 44:40.843
and then it was my turn,

44:40.879 --> 44:42.645
and so I'm flying
down the mountain,

44:42.681 --> 44:44.981
and I'm a little bit off,

44:45.016 --> 44:46.949
and I'm pushing,
and I'm pushing,

44:46.985 --> 44:48.317
and I'm trying
to find my line,

44:48.353 --> 44:49.485
and I just crashed,

44:49.521 --> 44:52.288
I just wiped out, hard,

44:52.323 --> 44:54.891
with the whole world
there to watch.

44:54.926 --> 44:58.728
All those years of training

44:58.763 --> 45:02.231
in just a few seconds, gone.

45:02.267 --> 45:03.232
It was...

45:03.268 --> 45:04.734
It was one race,
though.

45:04.769 --> 45:07.503
Why didn't you... try again?

45:09.374 --> 45:13.042
I got scared.

45:15.046 --> 45:16.212
Well, maybe

45:16.247 --> 45:19.215
this is kind of
a second chance.

45:19.250 --> 45:20.583
You can train Anna

45:20.618 --> 45:23.152
the way you always wish
that you were trained.

45:24.723 --> 45:27.724
You know, I feel like
I kind of already am.

45:28.960 --> 45:30.727
Well, I think
that's a beautiful thing.

45:32.363 --> 45:34.664
As are many things
around this town.

45:39.137 --> 45:42.238
You know, I've been so busy

45:42.273 --> 45:45.374
working and raising Anna,

45:45.410 --> 45:49.011
I haven't really had time
for much else.

45:49.047 --> 45:51.280
Well, it's a new year.

45:51.316 --> 45:54.884
Maybe it's time
for a fresh start.

45:58.323 --> 46:01.457
I've got to say, this trip
has turned out to be

46:01.493 --> 46:03.226
a whole lot more
than I expected.

46:08.500 --> 46:09.577
No! Yes!

46:09.601 --> 46:12.301
Oh, hey, Dad!

46:12.337 --> 46:13.547
Lindsay let me drive
the snowmobile!

46:13.571 --> 46:14.704
The snowmobile?

46:14.739 --> 46:15.739
What...?

46:15.774 --> 46:16.774
That's good.

46:16.808 --> 46:18.474
That's good.
That's...

46:18.510 --> 46:19.408
Don't you need
a licence or something

46:19.444 --> 46:20.444
to drive those?

46:20.478 --> 46:22.912
Oh, hey,
it's Bliss Valley.

46:24.783 --> 46:26.716
Yeah, yeah...

46:26.751 --> 46:28.618
It most certainly is.

46:40.899 --> 46:42.031
Two...

46:42.066 --> 46:43.366
three...

46:43.401 --> 46:45.067
Okay.

46:45.103 --> 46:46.536
One...

46:46.571 --> 46:48.204
Two...

46:48.239 --> 46:49.105
three...

46:49.140 --> 46:50.439
Hey, hey!

46:50.475 --> 46:52.441
Oh, hey, Dad.

46:52.477 --> 46:54.811
All right, let's talk
breakfast, huh?

46:54.846 --> 46:56.646
Uh, in a minute,
I'm training.

46:56.681 --> 46:58.881
Just need to get that...

46:58.917 --> 47:00.483
All right,
I'm training, too, okay?

47:04.355 --> 47:05.633
Hey,
you're in a good mood.

47:05.657 --> 47:06.589
Finish all your work?

47:06.624 --> 47:08.558
Nope. No, no...

47:08.593 --> 47:10.760
but, uh, you have
a training session with Kat

47:10.795 --> 47:11.795
in a couple of hours,

47:11.830 --> 47:13.930
so we've got
just enough time.

47:13.965 --> 47:15.498
Time for what?

47:15.533 --> 47:18.334
Making blueberry pancakes
with my daughter?

47:18.369 --> 47:19.580
- Okay...
- Come on!

47:19.604 --> 47:21.070
Here.

47:21.105 --> 47:22.071
I'll mix,

47:22.106 --> 47:23.506
and you...

47:23.541 --> 47:24.607
Ooh, uh, Dad,
maybe just...

47:24.642 --> 47:25.642
...you flip.

47:25.677 --> 47:26.609
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

47:26.644 --> 47:27.810
Uh... Ooh!

47:27.846 --> 47:29.278
Oh, yes, that's my daughter!

47:30.281 --> 47:31.914
I'll take the flour...

47:31.950 --> 47:33.482
All right, turn
this music up, okay?

47:35.186 --> 47:36.485
Hey, here you go.

47:36.521 --> 47:37.521
Three? Two?

47:37.555 --> 47:38.654
Whoa!

47:38.690 --> 47:39.789
Easy on the sugar.

47:41.192 --> 47:42.658
Whoa! Oh!

47:42.694 --> 47:43.694
There it is.

47:45.163 --> 47:46.195
Hey.

47:46.231 --> 47:48.297
Hey, how'd
the morning shift go?

47:48.333 --> 47:50.166
The barn
is coming along.

47:50.201 --> 47:51.434
So...

47:51.469 --> 47:54.871
you and Ty were
smiling an awful lot

47:54.906 --> 47:56.272
at each other
last night.

47:56.307 --> 47:57.807
Sure.

47:57.842 --> 47:59.275
Come on, Kat,

47:59.310 --> 48:00.643
anything else
you want to tell me?

48:00.678 --> 48:01.777
Like what?

48:01.813 --> 48:04.113
You've never been able
to keep things from me before,

48:04.148 --> 48:05.828
so there's no sense
in trying to start now.

48:06.417 --> 48:07.650
I'll admit Ty's a nice guy.

48:08.920 --> 48:09.920
And...?

48:11.656 --> 48:13.723
And, uh, he's funny,

48:13.758 --> 48:15.157
and he's
attractive, but...

48:15.193 --> 48:16.193
So, what's the problem?

48:17.729 --> 48:19.161
We're just having fun.

48:19.197 --> 48:22.131
I mean, he's a single dad
with a daughter,

48:22.166 --> 48:23.544
and they live halfway
across the country.

48:23.568 --> 48:24.901
There are lots of people

48:24.936 --> 48:27.336
who make long-distance
relationships work.

48:27.372 --> 48:29.205
What matters most
is that you two connect.

48:30.942 --> 48:32.675
Yeah, but it's just
easier to...

48:32.710 --> 48:34.176
Stay hidden away?

48:36.281 --> 48:38.481
You know, you have
gone out on dates,

48:38.516 --> 48:39.715
here and there,

48:39.751 --> 48:41.017
but when was the last time

48:41.052 --> 48:42.685
you actually
put yourself out there?

48:44.055 --> 48:46.022
You deserve
good things, Kat.

48:46.057 --> 48:47.256
You just have to...

48:47.292 --> 48:49.859
give yourself permission
to be happy first.

48:49.894 --> 48:51.694
Wow.

48:51.729 --> 48:53.162
Thanks, Coach.

49:22.927 --> 49:24.560
That was awesome!

49:24.595 --> 49:26.929
Oh, I couldn't agree more.

49:26.965 --> 49:27.730
I just let gravity
take the way,

49:27.765 --> 49:28.564
like you told me to.

49:28.599 --> 49:29.432
What did you think, Dad?

49:29.467 --> 49:31.033
I think you're amazing.

49:31.069 --> 49:33.202
And I think you've learned
a lot of things this week.

49:33.237 --> 49:36.138
I'd say you're ready
for race day tomorrow.

49:36.174 --> 49:38.240
Come on.

49:38.276 --> 49:39.987
Uh, Kat, this is Emily.
We met in Maddy's class.

49:40.011 --> 49:41.077
Hi.

49:41.112 --> 49:42.611
Hi. Nice to meet you.

49:42.647 --> 49:43.579
Emily has
a question for you.

49:43.614 --> 49:45.147
What is it?

49:45.183 --> 49:46.863
I was wondering
if you could coach me, too.

49:47.919 --> 49:49.485
Oh, looks like
word's getting out

49:49.520 --> 49:51.087
about the new coach in town.

49:51.122 --> 49:52.221
We just moved to Bliss,

49:52.256 --> 49:53.500
and I'm gonna need a coach
going forward after this week,

49:53.524 --> 49:55.458
and I've seen you
and Anna,

49:55.493 --> 49:56.559
and, well...

49:56.594 --> 49:57.594
will you?

49:59.097 --> 50:01.797
Uh, well...

50:01.833 --> 50:02.732
I don't know,

50:02.767 --> 50:04.333
I'll think about it.

50:04.369 --> 50:05.234
I could talk to your parents.

50:05.269 --> 50:06.002
Have them call me

50:06.037 --> 50:07.281
at Heart of the Mountain
ski shop?

50:07.305 --> 50:08.738
Definitely. That's great.

50:08.773 --> 50:10.072
Come on, Emily,

50:10.108 --> 50:11.185
I have a trick
I want to show you,

50:11.209 --> 50:12.920
but first, we're gonna need
to stop at the snack bar.

50:12.944 --> 50:14.076
The snack bar?

50:14.112 --> 50:15.177
Yeah.

50:15.213 --> 50:16.679
We're gonna need
some marshmallows.

50:17.782 --> 50:19.615
Bye, hon'.

50:19.650 --> 50:20.316
Well...

50:20.351 --> 50:21.183
you might have
the makings

50:21.219 --> 50:23.352
of a booming
coaching business here.

50:23.388 --> 50:25.521
I never intended
to start coaching.

50:25.556 --> 50:27.323
There's been a lot
of unexpected things

50:27.358 --> 50:28.290
this week.

50:28.326 --> 50:29.291
Yeah.

50:29.327 --> 50:30.327
Hey, meet up later

50:30.361 --> 50:31.827
and help decorate
for Winterfest?

50:31.863 --> 50:32.863
Absolutely.

50:33.831 --> 50:35.197
Honestly, Kat,

50:35.233 --> 50:37.700
I never pictured you
as a coach.

50:37.735 --> 50:40.469
It just sort of
turned out that way.

50:40.505 --> 50:42.204
I don't mind a little
friendly competition.

50:42.240 --> 50:43.484
As long as you're
getting Anna ready

50:43.508 --> 50:45.141
for the race tomorrow.

50:45.176 --> 50:46.475
Yeah, she'll be ready.

50:46.511 --> 50:47.376
Good.

50:47.412 --> 50:48.822
You know, because
these girls came here

50:48.846 --> 50:50.279
to learn
how to be champions.

50:50.314 --> 50:52.048
Yeah, well,
we'll give it our all.

50:52.083 --> 50:53.816
I know you will.
Good luck out there.

51:01.559 --> 51:03.292
I guess it's on.

51:14.172 --> 51:16.005
Oh, uh, Ty...

51:16.040 --> 51:17.673
one side is...

51:17.708 --> 51:19.141
higher than the other.

51:19.177 --> 51:20.743
That's the whole idea.

51:20.778 --> 51:21.744
Lopsided?

51:21.779 --> 51:24.513
Well, no, it's like, you know,
Foxy the Ski Fox

51:24.549 --> 51:26.148
is skiing down the hill,

51:26.184 --> 51:27.650
gaining momentum.

51:27.685 --> 51:28.984
- Oh...
- Yeah?

51:29.020 --> 51:30.197
Yeah, I like that.
That's great.

51:30.221 --> 51:31.654
I do, yeah.

51:31.689 --> 51:32.689
Good idea.

51:33.591 --> 51:34.668
Hey, sweetheart,
how's it going?

51:34.692 --> 51:35.724
Oh, hey.

51:35.760 --> 51:36.792
It's going so great.

51:36.828 --> 51:38.539
All the stores are gonna be
lit up with candles,

51:38.563 --> 51:40.574
and the skiers are gonna
be coming down the mountain

51:40.598 --> 51:42.164
with torches...
It's so exciting.

51:42.200 --> 51:43.866
- It sounds fantastic.
- Yeah, it's great.

51:43.901 --> 51:45.067
Yeah.

51:46.070 --> 51:46.902
Hey, Kat?

51:46.938 --> 51:48.037
Yeah?

51:48.072 --> 51:49.038
The ice sculptor in town,

51:49.073 --> 51:49.905
you know, he's been
working overtime already.

51:49.941 --> 51:53.209
Yeah, he's really been
earning his pay.

51:53.244 --> 51:54.788
You know, I actually
paid my way through college

51:54.812 --> 51:56.545
making ice sculptures
for weddings.

51:56.581 --> 51:57.446
No way.

51:57.482 --> 51:58.547
I did.

51:58.583 --> 51:59.448
So, I could see if I could,
you know, make a few,

51:59.484 --> 52:00.516
if you want.

52:00.551 --> 52:01.917
I'm not gonna say no.

52:01.953 --> 52:03.519
Absolutely, thank you.

52:03.554 --> 52:04.520
Yes, yes.

52:04.555 --> 52:06.455
Okay, sweet.

52:06.491 --> 52:07.890
This place is looking
fantastic.

52:07.925 --> 52:09.058
It is.

52:09.093 --> 52:09.959
Thank you so much
for all your help.

52:09.994 --> 52:11.093
Thank you.

52:11.129 --> 52:12.695
You know what,
I think this crew

52:12.730 --> 52:13.896
could use some coffee.

52:13.931 --> 52:14.730
You wanna help me?

52:14.765 --> 52:15.765
I'd love to.

52:15.800 --> 52:16.832
Okay, let's go.

52:18.069 --> 52:20.736
All right, I need
five mochas,

52:20.771 --> 52:22.104
three lattes,

52:22.140 --> 52:24.306
and five cocoas.

52:24.342 --> 52:25.774
That'll be
a few minutes.

52:25.810 --> 52:29.044
Um, these are on the house
while you wait.

52:29.080 --> 52:30.080
Oh, wow.

52:30.114 --> 52:30.946
Oh, thanks.

52:30.982 --> 52:32.414
You're welcome.

52:33.351 --> 52:34.216
Mm...

52:34.252 --> 52:35.252
Oh, that smells good.

52:37.788 --> 52:40.556
Everybody's
so nice here.

52:42.460 --> 52:44.560
Mm... mm!

52:44.595 --> 52:47.763
What is it about cocoa
and the mountains?

52:47.798 --> 52:49.398
'Cause it's amazing.

52:49.433 --> 52:51.834
Yeah, I am feeling
a little bit more

52:51.869 --> 52:53.402
like a Bliss Valley-er.

52:53.437 --> 52:54.803
Or Bliss Valley-an?

52:54.839 --> 52:57.273
Bliss Valley-ite?

52:57.308 --> 52:58.574
Bliss Valley dude?

52:58.609 --> 52:59.408
How about just...

52:59.443 --> 53:00.776
"Living in Bliss?"

53:00.811 --> 53:02.778
Living in Bliss.

53:02.813 --> 53:04.947
It's a lovely community
to be a part of.

53:04.982 --> 53:07.149
I mean, it's fresh air,
fresh snow,

53:07.185 --> 53:09.418
fantastic
ski coaches.

53:09.453 --> 53:11.554
Oh, thanks.

53:12.490 --> 53:13.822
Thank you,

53:13.858 --> 53:15.291
for everything
you're doing, Kat.

53:15.326 --> 53:17.626
You're welcome.

53:17.662 --> 53:18.994
Cheers.

53:24.569 --> 53:25.834
Oh, thank you, son.

53:35.146 --> 53:36.146
Hey.

53:39.550 --> 53:41.283
Hey.

53:41.319 --> 53:42.851
Your dad's
on decoration duty,

53:42.887 --> 53:44.787
and he wanted me
to bring you this.

53:44.822 --> 53:45.888
Thanks.

53:46.857 --> 53:48.123
Are you
as excited as I am?

53:48.159 --> 53:49.892
The race is tomorrow!

53:49.927 --> 53:51.994
Yeah, I'm starting
to realize that.

53:54.732 --> 53:56.498
Hmm.

53:57.602 --> 53:58.602
What's up?

54:00.571 --> 54:02.571
I guess I'm just
a bit nervous.

54:02.607 --> 54:04.240
Yeah, well,

54:04.275 --> 54:06.508
pre-race jitters
are totally normal.

54:06.544 --> 54:08.544
Once you're on the hill,
you'll be fine.

54:08.579 --> 54:10.379
You've raced before.

54:10.414 --> 54:11.380
It's no different.

54:11.415 --> 54:12.848
I don't know.

54:12.883 --> 54:14.350
It just feels...

54:14.385 --> 54:15.385
bigger.

54:23.527 --> 54:25.227
Anna...

54:25.263 --> 54:26.495
do you trust me?

54:26.530 --> 54:28.030
Yeah.

54:29.200 --> 54:30.833
Good.

54:30.868 --> 54:33.702
Because I'm telling you,
you are gonna be great.

54:36.040 --> 54:38.207
Look...

54:38.242 --> 54:40.843
why don't we have
one final lesson tomorrow?

54:40.878 --> 54:42.089
We'll go to the top
of the mountain,

54:42.113 --> 54:43.345
do a dry run,

54:43.381 --> 54:44.947
get you
used to the course.

54:44.982 --> 54:48.751
That always calmed my nerves.

54:48.786 --> 54:50.252
What do you think?

54:51.756 --> 54:53.222
That sounds great.

54:53.257 --> 54:54.937
As long as my coach is there,
I'll be good.

54:55.593 --> 54:56.625
I'll be there.

54:56.661 --> 54:57.661
Okay?

54:59.463 --> 55:01.430
Oh, hey, Kat, um...

55:01.465 --> 55:02.264
I got you something,

55:02.300 --> 55:04.133
to say thanks.

55:04.168 --> 55:05.968
You didn't have to do that.

55:06.003 --> 55:07.269
You didn't
have to help me,

55:07.305 --> 55:08.305
but you did.

55:09.974 --> 55:11.974
Wow...

55:12.009 --> 55:13.976
It's from Winter Tree Resort
in Vermont.

55:14.011 --> 55:15.844
First one my mom took me to
as a kid.

55:16.981 --> 55:18.392
She said it would me help
to stand strong

55:18.416 --> 55:19.748
and remember my roots,

55:19.784 --> 55:20.749
and also

55:20.785 --> 55:23.218
that family is something
that grows with time.

55:23.254 --> 55:25.554
She had one, I have one.

55:25.589 --> 55:27.222
It's been one of
my lucky charms

55:27.258 --> 55:28.724
over the years.

55:28.759 --> 55:31.060
That's so sweet.

55:31.095 --> 55:32.594
But...

55:32.630 --> 55:35.230
I can't take
your mother's pin.

55:35.266 --> 55:36.565
No, really,

55:36.600 --> 55:38.160
it would be nice
to share this with you.

55:42.606 --> 55:43.606
Thank you.

55:46.143 --> 55:48.143
Coming to Bliss Valley
has been amazing,

55:48.179 --> 55:50.312
for me, for my skiing,

55:50.348 --> 55:51.348
for my dad...

55:53.784 --> 55:54.950
Right.

55:55.986 --> 55:58.754
All right, we'll have
that practice run tomorrow,

55:58.789 --> 55:59.755
all right,
I'll see you at noon?

55:59.790 --> 56:00.790
Yeah.

56:15.306 --> 56:17.139
I am thinking positive.

56:17.174 --> 56:18.240
Thanks, Dad.

56:18.275 --> 56:19.908
Me too!

56:19.944 --> 56:21.176
Whoa!

56:23.848 --> 56:26.982
I guess, uh,
I've got a few nerves.

56:28.018 --> 56:29.518
Look, honey,

56:29.553 --> 56:30.786
no matter
what happens,

56:30.821 --> 56:32.421
you have done
a great job.

56:32.456 --> 56:33.589
Thanks.

56:33.624 --> 56:34.690
I'll tell you,

56:34.725 --> 56:36.603
I'm almost as excited
to watch Anna race tomorrow

56:36.627 --> 56:38.093
as I was to watch you.

56:38.129 --> 56:39.161
Yeah.

56:40.464 --> 56:43.132
Well, you know, she's nervous.

56:43.167 --> 56:45.768
I'm clearly nervous, but...

56:45.803 --> 56:46.769
it's just, you know,

56:46.804 --> 56:48.704
it's just bringing up
a lot of memories, so...

56:48.739 --> 56:51.140
I just want you to know,

56:51.175 --> 56:53.308
I'm really,
really proud of you, Kat.

56:53.344 --> 56:54.676
I know it wasn't easy for you,

56:54.712 --> 56:56.011
seeing Maddy this week,

56:56.046 --> 56:57.212
and jumping back

56:57.248 --> 56:59.715
into the whole
competitive world,

56:59.750 --> 57:01.483
but helping Anna
the way you have been...?

57:03.587 --> 57:05.053
If I could
hand out medals,

57:05.089 --> 57:07.756
I'd give you
the gold.

57:11.695 --> 57:13.395
Thanks, Pops.

57:13.431 --> 57:15.297
Thank you.

57:15.332 --> 57:18.200
And look, Anna is
gonna be just fine.

57:18.235 --> 57:20.035
She's got you to lean on,

57:20.070 --> 57:21.870
and her Dad.

57:22.873 --> 57:24.673
Nice fella, Ty.

57:26.010 --> 57:27.242
What?

57:27.278 --> 57:28.310
What are you hinting at?

57:28.345 --> 57:30.512
Who, me?

57:30.548 --> 57:32.381
Yeah.
You're hinting.

57:32.416 --> 57:35.517
I'm just saying
he's a stand-up guy,

57:35.553 --> 57:36.997
for someone who's not
from Bliss Valley.

57:37.021 --> 57:38.654
Where is he from...

57:38.689 --> 57:39.766
I think he's from
New York, or...

57:39.790 --> 57:41.757
Uh...

57:41.792 --> 57:43.125
I-I'll be right back.

57:54.638 --> 57:57.005
Well, today's the big day.

57:57.041 --> 57:59.007
We just have to finish
setting up

57:59.043 --> 58:00.776
before the race this afternoon.

58:00.811 --> 58:02.878
Look at this!

58:02.913 --> 58:04.079
Alex!

58:04.114 --> 58:06.782
Ring toss with the icicles?

58:06.817 --> 58:07.783
I love it.

58:09.053 --> 58:10.252
It's awesome.

58:15.826 --> 58:18.126
Jasper! Who knew
you were so talented?

58:18.162 --> 58:18.994
I know.

58:19.029 --> 58:21.630
He's like Michelangelo
with an ice block.

58:22.800 --> 58:23.732
Kat, I have to tell you,

58:23.767 --> 58:25.701
I am just so impressed.

58:25.736 --> 58:28.370
I mean, things are really
coming together for Winterfest.

58:28.405 --> 58:29.483
Now, why don't you
walk me through

58:29.507 --> 58:30.706
all of the activities?

58:30.741 --> 58:32.407
Oh, well, the race
is at 3:00,

58:32.443 --> 58:33.809
and then at sundown,

58:33.844 --> 58:35.544
the Fest officially kicks off,

58:35.579 --> 58:36.945
where we have cocoa
and cider,

58:36.981 --> 58:38.313
and games, and the band,

58:38.349 --> 58:40.293
and then we do the torch parade
down the mountain.

58:40.317 --> 58:41.116
Do you think maybe

58:41.151 --> 58:42.471
we're taking on
a little too much?

58:43.454 --> 58:44.953
Absolutely!

58:44.989 --> 58:45.954
Me too.

58:45.990 --> 58:46.955
You keep up
the good work.

58:46.991 --> 58:47.789
All right.

58:47.825 --> 58:49.591
Oh, thanks.

58:49.627 --> 58:52.561
So, uh, the ski barn,
it's almost complete.

58:52.596 --> 58:55.230
I've gotta tell you,
it looks fantastic.

58:55.266 --> 58:56.306
I can't believe
we made it.

58:56.333 --> 58:58.433
You did a great job.

58:58.469 --> 59:00.402
Uh... so I will
see you at noon?

59:00.437 --> 59:01.837
Oh, yeah. Yes, you bet.

59:01.872 --> 59:02.738
All right.

59:02.773 --> 59:04.451
I, uh, I have some
errands I've got to run,

59:04.475 --> 59:05.440
so see you then.

59:05.476 --> 59:06.476
- Okay.
- Okay.

59:19.323 --> 59:20.756
Six more boxes of lights!

59:20.791 --> 59:21.757
Courtesy of
the hardware store.

59:21.792 --> 59:23.692
Okay, thanks a lot, fellas,
that sounds perfect.

59:23.727 --> 59:24.760
We'll see you
at the barn.

59:24.795 --> 59:26.361
The band says

59:26.397 --> 59:28.363
they're gonna be setting up
in an hour or two.

59:28.399 --> 59:30.032
Kat, I've got
to hand it to you,

59:30.067 --> 59:31.545
You've really made this
all come together.

59:31.569 --> 59:33.001
I'm just
so glad it's working.

59:33.037 --> 59:35.637
The speakers are
about to be delivered,

59:35.673 --> 59:37.372
along with the sound system
for the band.

59:37.408 --> 59:39.007
And what about
the generator?

59:39.043 --> 59:40.709
Generator?

59:40.744 --> 59:41.855
Well, yeah,
to make everything run,

59:41.879 --> 59:42.889
unless they're playing acoustic.

59:42.913 --> 59:45.814
Oh, gosh, I totally forgot
about the generator.

59:45.849 --> 59:47.160
Maybe the hardware store
has one we can borrow.

59:47.184 --> 59:48.350
Excellent.

59:48.385 --> 59:49.184
Could I get you
to pick that up?

59:49.219 --> 59:50.397
I've really got
my hands full here

59:50.421 --> 59:51.353
directing all this traffic.

59:51.388 --> 59:54.022
Well, I've got
a practice run with Anna...

59:55.526 --> 59:56.625
Uh, yeah, I got it.

59:56.660 --> 59:57.926
Great.

01:00:00.831 --> 01:00:02.731
Ty, I've just got
to zip across town

01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:04.199
to pick up a generator,

01:00:04.234 --> 01:00:05.133
I shouldn't be long,

01:00:05.169 --> 01:00:06.646
<i>and then we'll go
up to the mountain</i>

01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:07.670
<i>and do her practice.</i>

01:00:07.705 --> 01:00:08.782
Okay, we're just about to go up
on the lifts.

01:00:08.806 --> 01:00:11.206
We'll do some stretching
at the top and wait for you.

01:00:11.241 --> 01:00:13.041
All right, I'll see you then.

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:17.646
Thanks, guys,

01:00:17.681 --> 01:00:19.147
just put it right
in the front there.

01:00:19.183 --> 01:00:20.382
Yeah.

01:00:22.853 --> 01:00:24.186
Hey, thanks again.

01:00:27.057 --> 01:00:28.023
What?

01:00:28.058 --> 01:00:30.826
Wait! Uh, guys?

01:00:32.062 --> 01:00:32.995
Oh, no...

01:00:37.267 --> 01:00:38.300
Hey, guys?
My truck!

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:51.013
All right...

01:01:02.059 --> 01:01:04.526
No pressure there.

01:01:04.561 --> 01:01:06.795
You've got this, honey.

01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:08.363
You all right?

01:01:08.399 --> 01:01:09.731
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

01:01:09.767 --> 01:01:11.111
You want to do some more
stretching or something?

01:01:11.135 --> 01:01:12.868
No way.
All's good, Dad.

01:01:14.638 --> 01:01:15.971
Is Kat gonna be here soon?

01:01:16.006 --> 01:01:17.272
Yeah, she'll be here
any second.

01:01:18.575 --> 01:01:20.275
I can call her
if you want me to.

01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:21.243
Yeah, that'd be good.

01:01:21.278 --> 01:01:22.844
Sure.

01:01:26.083 --> 01:01:27.083
Uh...

01:01:28.786 --> 01:01:30.096
I have no reception
up here, honey.

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:31.286
Sorry.

01:01:33.624 --> 01:01:34.990
Okay.

01:01:35.025 --> 01:01:36.758
Great.

01:01:36.794 --> 01:01:38.627
Come on...

01:01:41.331 --> 01:01:43.065
Yes!

01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:44.100
Yes! All right.

01:01:51.008 --> 01:01:52.974
Ty, it's me again.

01:01:53.010 --> 01:01:55.250
I was at the hardware store,
and my truck wouldn't start.

01:01:55.279 --> 01:01:56.611
I'm really sorry.

01:01:56.647 --> 01:01:59.247
I'll try to get there
as soon as I can.

01:01:59.283 --> 01:02:00.615
You know, Dad,

01:02:00.651 --> 01:02:02.484
maybe I should do one run
down the course

01:02:02.519 --> 01:02:04.119
before Kat gets here.

01:02:04.154 --> 01:02:05.994
Whatever you want.
You're in the driver's seat.

01:02:26.310 --> 01:02:27.310
Anna!

01:02:27.344 --> 01:02:28.310
Hey, Maddy.

01:02:28.345 --> 01:02:29.878
Hey.
How's it going?

01:02:29.913 --> 01:02:30.879
Okay.

01:02:30.914 --> 01:02:32.547
How are...
How are you?

01:02:32.583 --> 01:02:33.949
Good.
Great, actually.

01:02:33.984 --> 01:02:34.994
I'm about to take
a few of my girls

01:02:35.018 --> 01:02:37.219
down on a practice run,

01:02:37.254 --> 01:02:38.653
down the race course,
you know?

01:02:38.689 --> 01:02:39.955
You about to do the same?

01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:41.123
Yeah,

01:02:41.158 --> 01:02:43.002
I thought it would help prepare
my mind for the race.

01:02:43.026 --> 01:02:44.059
You sure?

01:02:44.094 --> 01:02:46.728
I mean, I might
just be saying this,

01:02:46.764 --> 01:02:48.208
because I'm just
a little disappointed

01:02:48.232 --> 01:02:50.076
that I didn't get a chance
to finish training you.

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:51.867
You know, I'm sorry,

01:02:51.902 --> 01:02:54.369
you're a great coach,
it's just...

01:02:54.404 --> 01:02:56.171
Maybe I needed to do
my own thing.

01:02:56.206 --> 01:02:57.839
Oh.

01:02:57.875 --> 01:02:59.007
But like Kat said,

01:02:59.042 --> 01:03:01.122
you're the best skier
that this mountain's ever seen.

01:03:03.447 --> 01:03:04.613
Huh.

01:03:06.016 --> 01:03:06.982
She said that?

01:03:07.017 --> 01:03:09.184
Yeah.

01:03:09.219 --> 01:03:11.019
Huh.

01:03:12.256 --> 01:03:13.722
Well, where
is she anyway?

01:03:13.757 --> 01:03:15.557
She'll be here any minute.

01:03:15.592 --> 01:03:16.925
Yeah, I'm just waiting for her.

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:18.226
You guys can
go ahead of me

01:03:18.262 --> 01:03:19.127
if you want.

01:03:19.163 --> 01:03:21.897
Oh, no, we wouldn't want
to jump the line.

01:03:23.934 --> 01:03:25.245
All right, maybe I'll take
one run down the course,

01:03:25.269 --> 01:03:26.201
and then head back up.

01:03:26.236 --> 01:03:27.269
Are you sure?

01:03:27.304 --> 01:03:28.537
Yeah, yeah.

01:03:28.572 --> 01:03:31.039
Okay, cool. Cool.

01:03:31.074 --> 01:03:32.507
Stay safe.

01:03:32.543 --> 01:03:34.009
Right. Thanks.

01:03:45.455 --> 01:03:46.888
<i>Lindsay?</i>

01:03:46.924 --> 01:03:48.735
Hey, Kat, you're gonna
want to come by Ski Patrol

01:03:48.759 --> 01:03:49.858
as soon as you can.

01:03:49.893 --> 01:03:50.792
<i>Why? What's wrong?</i>

01:03:50.828 --> 01:03:53.461
<i>Anna had a little mishap
on the mountain.</i>

01:03:53.497 --> 01:03:54.729
Okay, I'll be right there!

01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:04.206
Is she okay?

01:04:04.241 --> 01:04:05.318
She's fine,
she's just shaken,

01:04:05.342 --> 01:04:06.422
She took
a pretty good fall.

01:04:07.778 --> 01:04:09.744
Anna, what happened?

01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:11.558
Kat, I'm so sorry.
I should have waited for you.

01:04:11.582 --> 01:04:12.614
I just,

01:04:12.649 --> 01:04:14.249
I thought I'd do it
on my own.

01:04:14.284 --> 01:04:15.584
Then on the third turn,

01:04:15.619 --> 01:04:17.096
I must have hit
some ice or something.

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:18.620
I guess I was just rattled,

01:04:18.655 --> 01:04:20.021
with Maddy
and everybody watching.

01:04:21.258 --> 01:04:23.425
I'm so sorry
I was not there for you.

01:04:25.095 --> 01:04:26.928
Ty...

01:04:26.964 --> 01:04:28.630
this is all my fault.

01:04:28.665 --> 01:04:30.932
No, it's not
your fault, Kat.

01:04:30.968 --> 01:04:32.334
These things happen.

01:04:32.369 --> 01:04:33.335
I'm her coach,

01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:36.271
I'm supposed to be there
to make sure they don't.

01:04:37.474 --> 01:04:39.140
I just thought I could do it.

01:04:40.677 --> 01:04:42.143
You can do it.

01:04:42.179 --> 01:04:43.812
She's just
going to need

01:04:43.847 --> 01:04:45.280
to rest a little bit first.

01:04:45.315 --> 01:04:46.581
That's a great idea.

01:04:46.617 --> 01:04:47.916
Honey, come on,

01:04:47.951 --> 01:04:49.651
let's go back
to the hotel, okay?

01:04:49.686 --> 01:04:51.486
Then you can rest up
before the race.

01:04:51.521 --> 01:04:53.521
Dad...

01:04:53.557 --> 01:04:56.091
I don't want to do the race.

01:04:56.126 --> 01:04:57.425
I don't.

01:05:06.637 --> 01:05:09.271
Anna's feeling
better, but...

01:05:09.306 --> 01:05:11.373
she wants to go home.

01:05:11.408 --> 01:05:15.010
She says she will not race,

01:05:15.045 --> 01:05:18.013
and I've got work
in a few days, so...

01:05:18.048 --> 01:05:19.347
I'm sorry.

01:05:19.383 --> 01:05:21.016
Do you really
have to leave tomorrow?

01:05:22.419 --> 01:05:24.019
It's going to be
a busy week.

01:05:26.823 --> 01:05:30.859
Well, I'm sorry
how the trip turned out.

01:05:30.894 --> 01:05:31.826
I just don't want her
leaving here

01:05:31.862 --> 01:05:32.727
feeling like she failed.

01:05:32.763 --> 01:05:34.162
I know.

01:05:34.197 --> 01:05:35.030
Maybe the whole thing

01:05:35.065 --> 01:05:36.998
was just a little
too much for her.

01:05:39.603 --> 01:05:42.304
You know, Ty,
I had my chances,

01:05:42.339 --> 01:05:44.673
but she's got all these
chances in front of her,

01:05:44.708 --> 01:05:47.509
and I hope she takes them.

01:05:47.544 --> 01:05:49.010
She really has potential.

01:05:49.046 --> 01:05:51.212
Yeah, I know.

01:05:52.683 --> 01:05:54.215
I just don't
want her to miss out.

01:05:55.852 --> 01:05:57.185
Kat...

01:05:57.220 --> 01:05:59.354
thank you for everything
you did this week.

01:05:59.389 --> 01:06:00.422
It's been...

01:06:00.457 --> 01:06:01.990
Well, it's been
pretty amazing.

01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:09.631
I better, uh...
go check on Anna.

01:06:12.135 --> 01:06:13.568
I know she'll want
to say goodbye

01:06:13.603 --> 01:06:15.036
before we leave.

01:06:31.088 --> 01:06:32.687
Uh-oh.

01:06:32.723 --> 01:06:34.723
That bad, huh?

01:06:34.758 --> 01:06:35.991
What do you mean?

01:06:37.094 --> 01:06:39.527
Well, when you were racing
and had a bad day,

01:06:39.563 --> 01:06:41.529
you started waxing skis.

01:06:41.565 --> 01:06:43.598
It just soothes me.

01:06:43.633 --> 01:06:44.399
Would it make you
happy to hear

01:06:44.434 --> 01:06:46.568
that the resort
is close to capacity

01:06:46.603 --> 01:06:48.203
and the barn is ready to go,

01:06:48.238 --> 01:06:49.238
thanks to you?

01:06:50.607 --> 01:06:51.873
That's great, Pops.

01:06:51.908 --> 01:06:53.074
Kat...

01:06:53.110 --> 01:06:55.143
what's up?

01:06:55.178 --> 01:06:58.313
I just feel terrible
about Anna.

01:06:58.348 --> 01:07:00.548
I'm really sorry to hear that.

01:07:00.584 --> 01:07:03.151
I know this has been
hard on you,

01:07:03.186 --> 01:07:04.953
but you've seemed happier
this week

01:07:04.988 --> 01:07:06.654
than you have
in such a long time.

01:07:06.690 --> 01:07:08.423
Yeah, I just don't know
what I was thinking,

01:07:08.458 --> 01:07:09.591
I lost focus,

01:07:09.626 --> 01:07:12.494
and I failed
as Anna's coach.

01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:13.529
You tried.

01:07:16.166 --> 01:07:17.799
Sweetheart...

01:07:17.834 --> 01:07:20.568
sometimes, trying
is good enough.

01:07:20.604 --> 01:07:22.270
Okay?

01:07:22.305 --> 01:07:24.572
I'm gonna go scope out
a seat on the slopes.

01:07:24.608 --> 01:07:25.840
Why don't you come?

01:07:25.876 --> 01:07:28.977
The race
is starting soon.

01:07:29.012 --> 01:07:31.112
I'll think about it.

01:07:31.148 --> 01:07:33.181
Okay.

01:07:33.216 --> 01:07:34.949
Your personal best
is always good enough.

01:08:14.324 --> 01:08:16.890
Well, I think I got
most of the stuff packed.

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:19.027
The race should be
starting soon.

01:08:19.062 --> 01:08:20.694
Yup.

01:08:22.999 --> 01:08:24.966
Be a shame to miss it.

01:08:25.001 --> 01:08:26.001
Honey...

01:08:27.370 --> 01:08:29.170
Are you sure
you don't want to do the race?

01:08:31.374 --> 01:08:32.974
Of course I do.

01:08:33.009 --> 01:08:34.142
Well then, do it.

01:08:35.377 --> 01:08:36.877
So what, you fell?

01:08:36.912 --> 01:08:39.314
You get back up
and try it again.

01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:42.850
Anna, you are the most
tenacious person I know,

01:08:42.886 --> 01:08:44.886
and you're a great skier.

01:08:44.921 --> 01:08:47.154
Don't ever doubt that.

01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:48.756
You're just
saying that, Dad.

01:08:48.792 --> 01:08:50.603
Your skiing has improved
so much during this week,

01:08:50.627 --> 01:08:51.859
because of all your hard work,

01:08:51.895 --> 01:08:53.995
and Kat's lessons.

01:08:54.029 --> 01:08:56.831
I think you owe it to yourself

01:08:56.867 --> 01:08:58.765
to see this thing through
to the end.

01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:01.269
What if I wipe out
again, though?

01:09:01.304 --> 01:09:02.504
Then you get up again.

01:09:02.538 --> 01:09:03.371
I'm just...

01:09:03.406 --> 01:09:04.839
I'm scared.

01:09:06.643 --> 01:09:07.675
Yeah.

01:09:07.711 --> 01:09:10.245
I know, honey,

01:09:10.279 --> 01:09:11.112
and that's okay.

01:09:11.148 --> 01:09:13.581
Just as long
as it doesn't beat you.

01:09:16.586 --> 01:09:20.522
Honey, everybody
gets scared.

01:09:20.557 --> 01:09:22.457
I'm scared
every single day.

01:09:22.492 --> 01:09:23.524
Really?

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:25.093
Like, work and stuff?

01:09:25.127 --> 01:09:26.627
No, no, not work.

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:28.429
Work doesn't really mean
that much to me...

01:09:28.465 --> 01:09:30.031
Not deep down, no.

01:09:30.066 --> 01:09:31.299
Then what?

01:09:31.334 --> 01:09:33.902
Well, to be honest, I'm...

01:09:33.937 --> 01:09:38.372
I'm scared I'm not gonna be
all the parent that you need.

01:09:38.408 --> 01:09:39.374
You?

01:09:39.408 --> 01:09:40.475
You're a great dad.

01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:42.377
And what if I make a mistake?

01:09:42.412 --> 01:09:43.511
Even if you did,

01:09:43.546 --> 01:09:45.224
you'd always bounce back
and do something right again.

01:09:45.247 --> 01:09:45.947
Okay?

01:09:45.982 --> 01:09:47.415
You have nothing
to be scared of.

01:09:50.187 --> 01:09:51.685
And neither do you.

01:09:53.423 --> 01:09:54.455
You're a great skier,

01:09:54.491 --> 01:09:56.758
and an amazing daughter.

01:10:05.669 --> 01:10:08.836
Life gets difficult
around the turns,

01:10:08.872 --> 01:10:10.750
and we've had to navigate
some pretty tough turns

01:10:10.774 --> 01:10:11.774
the last few years.

01:10:13.843 --> 01:10:15.843
But I am so proud of you,

01:10:15.879 --> 01:10:18.379
and your mother would be, too.

01:10:20.183 --> 01:10:21.449
Mom would be proud of you.

01:10:30.827 --> 01:10:32.460
Oh, uh, hey, Dad,

01:10:32.495 --> 01:10:34.095
which suitcase has
my ski clothes in it?

01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:36.030
Uh, the purple one. Why?

01:10:36.066 --> 01:10:37.966
Because
I've got a race today.

01:10:53.283 --> 01:10:54.649
Kat...

01:10:54.684 --> 01:10:55.650
Hey.

01:10:55.685 --> 01:10:57.785
You decided to come.

01:10:57.821 --> 01:10:59.787
I'm glad.

01:10:59.823 --> 01:11:02.624
Yeah, I wanted to just
wish you luck, and...

01:11:02.659 --> 01:11:05.193
I know you did your best
to get your girls ready,

01:11:05.228 --> 01:11:06.761
and I hope they hit
their personal best

01:11:06.796 --> 01:11:08.196
and stay safe.

01:11:08.231 --> 01:11:09.897
Thanks.

01:11:20.176 --> 01:11:21.442
Hey, coach?

01:11:26.549 --> 01:11:28.316
You're here.

01:11:33.356 --> 01:11:34.455
I thought it over,

01:11:34.491 --> 01:11:35.690
I'm not giving up.

01:11:36.593 --> 01:11:37.625
Sweetheart,

01:11:37.661 --> 01:11:38.960
I'll wait down here.

01:11:38.995 --> 01:11:39.995
Good luck!

01:11:41.598 --> 01:11:43.665
I'd wish you luck, too,
but you don't need it,

01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:46.834
because just by you being here,
you've already won.

01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:48.703
Come on, let's go.

01:11:48.738 --> 01:11:49.837
Let's get you up there.

01:11:49.873 --> 01:11:51.339
Come on.

01:11:55.545 --> 01:11:58.012
<i>Welcome back
to the Slalom Exhibition Race!</i>

01:11:58.048 --> 01:12:00.648
<i>What a beautiful day here
at Bliss Mountain Resort,</i>

01:12:00.684 --> 01:12:04.619
<i>with this amazing group
of talented, young skiers...</i>

01:12:06.556 --> 01:12:08.656
<i>Maria Gartner is up next,</i>

01:12:08.692 --> 01:12:10.892
<i>and moving
to the starting line...</i>

01:12:12.962 --> 01:12:13.962
Go!

01:12:15.565 --> 01:12:17.699
<i>Wow. An impeccable start
from Gartner,</i>

01:12:17.734 --> 01:12:18.734
<i>very impressive.</i>

01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:22.270
<i>And extremely dynamic
on that opening turn.</i>

01:12:22.305 --> 01:12:24.205
<i>Maria Gartner is on course...</i>

01:12:30.647 --> 01:12:33.348
Our current leader
in the Winterfest Slalom

01:12:33.383 --> 01:12:35.450
is Maria Gartner from Cleveland.

01:12:35.485 --> 01:12:38.386
Maria is one
of Maddy Morrison's protégées,

01:12:38.421 --> 01:12:39.687
and it's very clear,

01:12:39.723 --> 01:12:42.023
she has a great future
in front of her.

01:12:42.058 --> 01:12:43.758
Up next, Anna Decker.

01:12:43.793 --> 01:12:44.959
Yes, Anna!
Let's go, Anna!

01:12:44.994 --> 01:12:46.027
Let's go!

01:12:46.062 --> 01:12:47.228
You can do this!

01:12:53.770 --> 01:12:55.103
Okay, Anna.

01:12:55.138 --> 01:12:57.271
You know what
I'm going to tell you,

01:12:57.307 --> 01:12:59.040
focus on your turns,

01:12:59.075 --> 01:13:00.608
pay attention to your breathing,

01:13:00.643 --> 01:13:03.277
but the best advice
I can give you,

01:13:03.313 --> 01:13:04.779
just have fun.

01:13:06.282 --> 01:13:07.382
As far as I'm concerned,

01:13:07.417 --> 01:13:08.461
it's all marshmallows
on the snow.

01:13:09.185 --> 01:13:10.318
<i>Racer to the Starting Gate.</i>

01:13:10.353 --> 01:13:11.353
All right, this is it.

01:13:12.922 --> 01:13:14.255
Good luck.

01:13:14.290 --> 01:13:16.924
Thanks, Kat.

01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:18.092
You got this.

01:13:38.782 --> 01:13:41.649
<i>And our final slalom racer
of the day is Anna Decker...</i>

01:13:41.684 --> 01:13:42.684
Oh, it's happening.

01:13:42.719 --> 01:13:43.763
<i>...hailing all the way
from New York City.</i>

01:13:43.787 --> 01:13:47.622
Excuse me, hi. Excuse me, hi.
Hi. Excuse me. Hi.

01:13:47.657 --> 01:13:49.123
I'm her dad.

01:13:49.159 --> 01:13:50.291
This one.

01:14:02.372 --> 01:14:03.771
Go!

01:14:06.509 --> 01:14:08.576
<i>And Anna Decker
is out of the starting gate!</i>

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:11.720
<i>A strong start from Anna.</i>

01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:17.452
<i>Wow, Decker is really setting
a new standard.</i>

01:14:17.487 --> 01:14:19.353
<i>She's around the first corner,</i>

01:14:19.389 --> 01:14:21.000
<i>and now into the second
part of the mountain...</i>

01:14:21.024 --> 01:14:22.123
She's really moving nice.

01:14:26.996 --> 01:14:29.630
<i>It's neck and neck here
with Maria Gartner's time.</i>

01:14:29.666 --> 01:14:31.632
<i>Can she make it?</i>

01:14:33.670 --> 01:14:34.670
Man, she's fast!

01:14:34.704 --> 01:14:35.636
Keep going, keep going!

01:14:35.672 --> 01:14:36.672
Go, Anna!

01:14:36.706 --> 01:14:37.706
She looks so smooth!

01:14:38.942 --> 01:14:40.107
Good, good, good, good.

01:14:42.345 --> 01:14:43.544
Come on, Anna,
you got this!

01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:44.580
Go, go, go!

01:14:45.515 --> 01:14:46.547
Yes!

01:14:53.056 --> 01:14:54.088
Yes, Anna!

01:14:54.123 --> 01:14:55.389
Good job!
That's a great race!

01:14:57.861 --> 01:14:59.393
Yeah, girl. Yeah!

01:14:59.429 --> 01:15:00.728
Yeah, nice job!

01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:05.032
Way to go, baby!

01:15:05.068 --> 01:15:06.434
I'm her dad,
I'm her dad.

01:15:06.469 --> 01:15:09.003
And with a time of 1:07:48,

01:15:09.038 --> 01:15:11.339
<i>our winner today...</i>

01:15:11.374 --> 01:15:12.573
<i>Anna Decker.</i>

01:15:12.609 --> 01:15:13.574
Yes!

01:15:13.610 --> 01:15:15.042
Yes!

01:15:15.078 --> 01:15:16.544
Yes!

01:15:16.579 --> 01:15:17.778
Oh, my gosh!

01:15:19.649 --> 01:15:21.249
I did it!

01:15:21.284 --> 01:15:22.250
I knew you could do it.

01:15:22.285 --> 01:15:23.518
That was amazing!

01:15:24.888 --> 01:15:25.720
Oh, my gosh!

01:15:25.755 --> 01:15:27.421
All right, yeah!

01:15:27.457 --> 01:15:29.357
My daughter!

01:15:29.392 --> 01:15:31.425
Anna Decker!

01:15:31.461 --> 01:15:32.627
Yes!

01:15:32.662 --> 01:15:34.095
Whoo!

01:15:35.098 --> 01:15:36.264
Hey.

01:15:36.299 --> 01:15:37.732
Your kid did
a pretty good run.

01:15:39.335 --> 01:15:40.234
Yeah, she did.

01:15:40.270 --> 01:15:41.102
It was great.

01:15:41.137 --> 01:15:42.570
I'm proud of her.

01:15:42.605 --> 01:15:43.771
And congratulations,

01:15:43.806 --> 01:15:46.274
your skiers
did well, too.

01:15:46.309 --> 01:15:47.942
Anyway...

01:15:47.977 --> 01:15:49.043
Good job.

01:15:49.078 --> 01:15:50.078
I mean...

01:15:50.113 --> 01:15:51.746
great job.

01:15:51.781 --> 01:15:52.781
Coach.

01:15:55.251 --> 01:15:56.251
Thanks.

01:15:58.087 --> 01:15:59.554
I'm spending
the rest of the season

01:15:59.589 --> 01:16:00.488
up at Epic, you know,

01:16:00.523 --> 01:16:01.889
but...

01:16:01.925 --> 01:16:03.558
I might send
some skiers your way

01:16:03.593 --> 01:16:04.559
that might...

01:16:04.594 --> 01:16:06.427
how do you say this,

01:16:06.462 --> 01:16:08.262
not respond well
to my coaching style?

01:16:08.298 --> 01:16:11.132
If you don't mind?

01:16:11.167 --> 01:16:12.912
You know what, I'll do
the same thing for you, too.

01:16:12.936 --> 01:16:14.402
Great.

01:16:14.437 --> 01:16:15.403
Oh, on one condition.

01:16:15.438 --> 01:16:17.004
What?

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:18.450
You teach me
about those marshmallows.

01:16:18.474 --> 01:16:20.207
Oh, uh...

01:16:21.711 --> 01:16:22.944
Absolutely.

01:16:24.881 --> 01:16:25.925
How'd you come up
with that anyway?

01:16:25.949 --> 01:16:28.182
Well, I'll let you know
after Junior Nationals.

01:16:28.217 --> 01:16:29.584
Oh, okay,
fair play, fair play.

01:16:36.326 --> 01:16:38.426
Kat! Kat!

01:16:39.629 --> 01:16:41.295
Ty!

01:16:41.331 --> 01:16:42.964
Yes!

01:16:44.534 --> 01:16:45.600
That was amazing.

01:16:45.635 --> 01:16:46.434
Oh, my gosh!

01:16:46.469 --> 01:16:47.335
Amazing!

01:16:47.370 --> 01:16:48.970
I'm so proud of her.

01:16:49.005 --> 01:16:51.172
She...
she was great.

01:16:51.207 --> 01:16:52.607
You were pretty great, too.

01:16:53.643 --> 01:16:55.610
Thanks, Ty.

01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:58.279
Uh, yeah, we...

01:16:58.314 --> 01:16:59.314
We should go.

01:16:59.349 --> 01:17:00.214
- Okay, let's do it.
- Okay.

01:17:00.249 --> 01:17:02.817
All right.

01:17:17.667 --> 01:17:18.877
Actually, when I look
at a block of ice,

01:17:18.901 --> 01:17:21.302
I don't just see
frozen water.

01:17:21.337 --> 01:17:25.039
I see the soul of my subject,
waiting to be freed.

01:17:27.944 --> 01:17:29.154
Thank you, Danielle.
Isn't she great?

01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:31.479
She'll be joining

01:17:31.514 --> 01:17:32.446
the rest of the members
of the band over in the barn

01:17:32.482 --> 01:17:34.715
where you can hear
even more terrific music.

01:17:34.751 --> 01:17:37.718
Everybody,
welcome to Winterfest.

01:17:37.754 --> 01:17:40.054
Now, as soon
as the sun sets,

01:17:40.089 --> 01:17:41.700
we're going to bring on
the torchlight parade

01:17:41.724 --> 01:17:43.257
and the firework display,

01:17:43.292 --> 01:17:44.158
so, everybody,

01:17:44.193 --> 01:17:45.237
I want you to grab yourselves
a candle,

01:17:45.261 --> 01:17:46.694
a torch, a flashlight,

01:17:46.729 --> 01:17:48.663
and let's light up
our beautiful mountain, huh?

01:17:50.867 --> 01:17:52.099
Right?

01:17:52.135 --> 01:17:53.200
Yes.

01:17:53.236 --> 01:17:55.102
That is what
I call après-ski.

01:17:55.138 --> 01:17:55.970
It's amazing.

01:17:56.005 --> 01:17:57.905
Oh, I couldn't have
done it without you.

01:17:57.940 --> 01:17:59.273
Thank you.

01:17:59.308 --> 01:18:01.609
This is a nice little
town you've got here,

01:18:01.644 --> 01:18:02.755
one that sure knows
how to throw a party.

01:18:02.779 --> 01:18:05.179
Derek, I thought
you couldn't make it!

01:18:05.214 --> 01:18:06.080
Well, I didn't
think I could,

01:18:06.115 --> 01:18:07.248
but Maddy convinced us

01:18:07.283 --> 01:18:08.182
we should come
check out the Fest.

01:18:08.217 --> 01:18:09.550
She also reminded me

01:18:09.585 --> 01:18:11.185
how great the slopes
were around here,

01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:12.853
so we moved some things around.

01:18:12.889 --> 01:18:13.921
And I gotta say,

01:18:13.956 --> 01:18:16.424
after seeing the skiing
earlier today, I agree.

01:18:16.459 --> 01:18:18.959
Yes, we have amazing snow!

01:18:20.463 --> 01:18:21.974
As a matter of fact,
our snow is so good,

01:18:21.998 --> 01:18:23.075
it got the start
of not only one,

01:18:23.099 --> 01:18:25.099
but two champions.

01:18:25.134 --> 01:18:26.434
Hey, maybe even three,
who knows?

01:18:26.469 --> 01:18:27.401
Yes.

01:18:28.638 --> 01:18:30.071
Actually...

01:18:30.106 --> 01:18:31.472
Kat taught me
half of what I know

01:18:31.507 --> 01:18:32.507
on these slopes.

01:18:35.578 --> 01:18:36.644
Are you gonna tell her?

01:18:36.679 --> 01:18:38.279
Tell me what?

01:18:38.314 --> 01:18:39.947
Do you think your slopes
are good enough

01:18:39.982 --> 01:18:41.342
for the Junior Nationals
next year?

01:18:43.419 --> 01:18:44.218
Really?

01:18:44.253 --> 01:18:45.753
Yeah, really.

01:18:45.788 --> 01:18:48.055
I think Bliss Valley
would make

01:18:48.091 --> 01:18:49.234
a great addition to our roster.

01:18:49.258 --> 01:18:50.903
Now, of course, that would mean
thousands more people

01:18:50.927 --> 01:18:51.892
coming here every year.

01:18:51.928 --> 01:18:52.928
My only reservation is,

01:18:52.962 --> 01:18:54.395
do you think your facilities

01:18:54.430 --> 01:18:55.896
could handle it?

01:18:55.932 --> 01:18:57.765
Of course, we can handle it!

01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:58.833
Oh, my gosh!

01:18:58.868 --> 01:19:00.234
We'll be in touch.

01:19:00.269 --> 01:19:02.236
All right. Thanks, Derek!

01:19:02.271 --> 01:19:03.271
Yes!

01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:07.074
I'm so proud of you.

01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:08.375
I'll see you around.

01:19:15.485 --> 01:19:17.251
Did you hear and see that?

01:19:17.286 --> 01:19:18.786
Oh, my gosh!

01:19:18.821 --> 01:19:19.787
Congratulations,

01:19:19.822 --> 01:19:20.788
that's incredible.

01:19:20.823 --> 01:19:21.789
Junior Nationals!

01:19:23.192 --> 01:19:24.458
Who's ready
for some fireworks?

01:19:24.494 --> 01:19:25.793
- Yes!
- Yes!

01:19:32.835 --> 01:19:33.667
<i>Uh, hello, everyone,</i>

01:19:33.703 --> 01:19:35.603

<i>boys and girls...</i>

01:19:42.311 --> 01:19:43.544
Light 'er up!

you could see me now ♪

01:19:50.586 --> 01:19:57.625

Whoo!

01:20:33.262 --> 01:20:35.696
Wow.

01:20:35.731 --> 01:20:37.598
Have you got
your binoculars?

01:20:37.633 --> 01:20:38.732
Oh.

01:20:40.703 --> 01:20:43.170
Oh, what is this?

01:20:44.307 --> 01:20:46.507
Ty...

01:20:46.542 --> 01:20:47.875
Thank you.

01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:50.711
Hey, the ski barn,

01:20:50.746 --> 01:20:52.446
sounds like
it's hoppin' over there.

01:20:52.481 --> 01:20:53.481
Um...

01:20:54.717 --> 01:20:55.850
May I have this dance?

01:20:55.885 --> 01:20:59.286
I'd love to.

01:21:17.607 --> 01:21:19.473
I'd have to say

01:21:19.508 --> 01:21:22.376
that our scrappy
side of the mountain

01:21:22.411 --> 01:21:24.712
is looking
pretty good tonight.

01:21:24.747 --> 01:21:27.448
Yeah, I would say so.

01:21:29.118 --> 01:21:30.551
So, what's next for you?

01:21:30.586 --> 01:21:32.453
I like the bunny hill,

01:21:32.488 --> 01:21:34.722
but I'm thinking...

01:21:34.757 --> 01:21:37.291
maybe I should coach
some up-and-comers,

01:21:37.326 --> 01:21:39.159
you know?

01:21:39.195 --> 01:21:40.227
What about you?

01:21:40.263 --> 01:21:41.896
You going home tomorrow?

01:21:41.931 --> 01:21:43.464
Yup, yup.

01:21:45.368 --> 01:21:47.902
Sad to see you go.

01:21:47.937 --> 01:21:49.837
Not me.

01:21:49.872 --> 01:21:51.839
Really?

01:21:51.874 --> 01:21:52.806
Yeah, well,

01:21:52.842 --> 01:21:54.419
I have to go home
at least for a little while

01:21:54.443 --> 01:21:56.410
if we're going to sell
our house in New York.

01:21:56.445 --> 01:21:58.646
I don't understand.

01:21:58.681 --> 01:22:00.681
Anna and I talked it out,

01:22:00.716 --> 01:22:02.783
and since I can pretty much
work from wherever,

01:22:02.818 --> 01:22:05.286
why not right here

01:22:05.321 --> 01:22:06.820
in Bliss Valley?

01:22:06.856 --> 01:22:08.923
I mean, it's got
an unbelievable mountain,

01:22:08.958 --> 01:22:12.426
great place to train
for Junior Nationals,

01:22:12.461 --> 01:22:14.261
and-and besides,

01:22:14.297 --> 01:22:16.463
she wants to be near her coach.

01:22:16.499 --> 01:22:18.165
Won't you miss New York?

01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:21.135
Why would I?

01:22:21.170 --> 01:22:24.505
Everything I want is right here.

01:22:31.147 --> 01:22:32.307
