00:06.874 --> 00:08.008
When you build something,

00:08.008 --> 00:09.343
you should build it
because you love it,

00:09.343 --> 00:11.078
not for the "exit."

00:11.078 --> 00:13.814
Why do we use something
just for a few minutes

00:13.814 --> 00:16.350
if it's gonna take
hundreds of years to decompose?

‐Oh!

00:18.051 --> 00:20.020
This is more than just
getting a quick buck back.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.755
We want to impact the world.

00:21.755 --> 00:23.056
You're thinking too small.

00:23.056 --> 00:26.093
You've got this game‐changer
that made me ask myself,

00:26.093 --> 00:27.728
"Why didn't I think of that?"
What?!

00:27.728 --> 00:29.863
Bonar: This is the biggest
innovation in years,

00:29.863 --> 00:32.232
All: And it'll blow your mind.
Boom!

01:17.744 --> 01:19.913
A child's mind

There's no limit to the magic

01:22.649 --> 01:26.386
They're filled with curiosity,
ideas, and emotions.

01:26.386 --> 01:28.455
But with art not being
a priority in schools,

01:28.455 --> 01:31.158
they rarely get an opportunity
to explore them.

01:31.158 --> 01:33.060
And that's why
we created...

to do a quick activity

a very quick and easy

going left to right,

02:41.294 --> 02:42.429
just like that.

02:42.429 --> 02:43.664
So you're gonna go from top.

and you're gonna
start at the top,

You say that to
all the girls. Come on.

03:11.658 --> 03:13.593
So, how do you sell?
Who's your audience?

03:13.593 --> 03:14.728
And for how much?

03:14.728 --> 03:16.930
Walker: So, to start off,
we started off

03:16.930 --> 03:18.465
with the homeschool market,
and over time,

03:18.465 --> 03:20.600
it branched off
into any parent

03:20.600 --> 03:22.736
who is struggling
to teach their kids creativity.

03:22.736 --> 03:24.638
How do you reach
those parents?

03:24.638 --> 03:26.373
Samuel: The homeschool market
is really, like,

03:26.373 --> 03:28.575
closed off and tight‐knit,
so it's hard to get into.

03:28.575 --> 03:31.278
So we kind of, like,
infiltrated ourselves into it.

03:31.278 --> 03:33.814
We went to expos,
so when we started Sparketh,

03:33.814 --> 03:35.716
we started off
by going to one expo.

03:35.716 --> 03:38.652
And to get into that expo,
we literally had no money.

03:38.652 --> 03:39.986
We were
broke college students.

03:39.986 --> 03:41.822
We started with $500.
Yeah.

03:41.822 --> 03:43.824
And after we built
the website,

03:43.824 --> 03:46.460
which we didn't have
the best technology ‐‐

03:46.460 --> 03:48.895
So, I worked at
a graphic design job,

03:48.895 --> 03:51.765
and so I snuck Tim
into the office after hours...

03:51.765 --> 03:52.999
‐Yeah.
‐...for days and months.

03:52.999 --> 03:54.201
‐I love it.
‐Yeah.

03:54.201 --> 03:55.602
Yeah.

03:55.602 --> 03:57.537
And we taught ourselves
PHP, CSS, and HTML...
Yeah.

03:57.537 --> 03:59.272
...just enough
to build out the MVP.
Yeah.

03:59.272 --> 04:01.608
I taught the courses.
He filmed and edited them.

04:01.608 --> 04:03.076

He's gonna ‐‐

04:04.411 --> 04:05.946
So where did you guys
go to college?

04:05.946 --> 04:06.980

04:06.980 --> 04:08.515
In Atlanta, Georgia.
Atlanta, Georgia.

04:08.515 --> 04:11.118
But we ended up dropping out
when the business was...
Yeah.

...you know ‐‐
as it started growing.
Growing.

04:12.552 --> 04:15.055
So how good is the business if
it's enough for you to drop out?

04:15.055 --> 04:16.857
For me,
I think that personally,

04:16.857 --> 04:18.291
I just love
entrepreneurship,

04:18.291 --> 04:20.560
and I realized that
that was my passion early on.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.796
And also, I was born
with sickle cell disease,

04:22.796 --> 04:24.397
so that's been, like,
super‐tough on me.

04:24.397 --> 04:26.199
Sickle cell disease
is a blood disorder.

04:26.199 --> 04:29.970
And so the average lifespan
of someone with sickle cell

04:29.970 --> 04:31.238
is 30 years old.

04:31.238 --> 04:32.606
And that's when it really
clicked in my mind

04:32.606 --> 04:34.608
that I was, like,
I don't really have time

04:34.608 --> 04:36.443
to take the traditional path
or anything.

04:36.443 --> 04:38.111
I have to
go for what I want,

04:38.111 --> 04:40.013
what I'm passionate about,
and that's entrepreneurship.

04:40.013 --> 04:42.349
I truly feel like
I'm very gifted in it.

04:42.349 --> 04:44.484
And even if I wasn't making
a single dollar,

04:44.484 --> 04:46.887
or I was a billionaire tomorrow,
like some of you guys,

04:46.887 --> 04:49.389
I would be getting up every day
and doing entrepreneurship.

04:49.389 --> 04:50.590
So how old are you now?

04:50.590 --> 04:52.425
I'm 25 years old now, yes.

04:52.425 --> 04:53.493
Wow.
You look like a baby.

How did you guys meet?
What's your story?

04:54.895 --> 04:57.764
Walker: Man, so we actually met
as kids growing up

04:57.764 --> 04:59.099
through a mutual friend,

04:59.099 --> 05:00.734
and through magic tricks,
actually.

05:00.734 --> 05:02.169
Yeah, we love magic.

05:02.169 --> 05:04.004
Yeah. Do you guys actually want
to see one real quick?

05:04.004 --> 05:05.272
‐Yes. Yes.
‐Sure.
‐For sure.

05:05.272 --> 05:06.573
All right, cool.
So, you know, we did go through

05:06.573 --> 05:07.808
a lot of dark times
in life,

05:07.808 --> 05:10.143
but, you know,
this is a very bright situation.

05:18.018 --> 05:19.286
It was black before,
right?

05:19.286 --> 05:20.487
Yeah,
it was black before.
Yeah, it was.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.222
‐Good one!
‐Yeah.

05:22.222 --> 05:24.391
All right. What are you
doing in revenue?

05:24.391 --> 05:26.726
So last year, we did
300K in revenue.

05:26.726 --> 05:28.528
All direct to consumer?

05:28.528 --> 05:31.731
All ‐‐ yeah, all B2C.
And it's all
online art classes.

05:31.731 --> 05:33.834
Yeah, it's a subscription‐model
business,

05:33.834 --> 05:36.603
so a parent will sign up
and pay $25 a month,

05:36.603 --> 05:38.071
and then they get
two student accounts.

05:38.071 --> 05:40.040
O'Leary: So you have to
acquire that customer...
Exactly.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.942
...and then you've got to
keep them there.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.243
What does it cost you
to acquire a customer,

05:43.243 --> 05:45.579
and how many actually stick
with you past 12 months?

05:45.579 --> 05:47.447
Yeah. So right now,
no one's sticking with us

05:47.447 --> 05:49.683
past 12 months.

05:49.683 --> 05:52.552
There's about more around
like $160

05:52.552 --> 05:53.753
is the lifetime
customer value,

05:53.753 --> 05:55.856
which is about like
six to seven months

05:55.856 --> 05:57.524
is around the time that people
are staying.

05:57.524 --> 06:00.260
And $51.50
to acquire a customer.

06:00.260 --> 06:01.628
O'Leary: Whoa.

Corcoran: Hey, Dwayne,
you mentioned

06:02.896 --> 06:04.698
you made $300,000 last year.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.366
Was that your first year
in business?

06:06.366 --> 06:07.868
No, it wasn't our first year
in business.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.569
We actually started
in 2015.

06:09.569 --> 06:10.837
And what were the sales...
Not profitable, though.

06:10.837 --> 06:13.139
...say, last year compar‐‐
or the last two years?

06:13.139 --> 06:13.974
How did they compare?

06:13.974 --> 06:15.275
Last year, we did 300K.

06:15.275 --> 06:17.978
The year before that
was 75K,

06:17.978 --> 06:20.113
and then the year before that
was 110K.

06:20.113 --> 06:22.349
So something did happen
in there.

06:22.349 --> 06:23.950
What happened is 2018,

06:23.950 --> 06:26.786
we pushed ourselves so hard,
traveling nonstop,

we were going to
homeschool expos.

06:28.021 --> 06:29.789
We started with one, then
the next year, we hit three,

06:29.789 --> 06:31.625
then we did 11,
then we did 22,

06:31.625 --> 06:33.994
and the sickle cell and just
not getting a break,

06:33.994 --> 06:36.062
every weekend selling
and being on my feet,

06:36.062 --> 06:38.698
I ended up, like, putting myself
in the hospital.

putting himself in the hospital.
Yeah.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.603

at the same time...

What's the 100K for?
How are you gonna use it?

06:52.045 --> 06:54.981
So, the 100K is for content
and to build out

a better version
of the platform.

you're not really losing money.

Exactly. We could be profitable
if we wanted to.

16:09.335 --> 16:11.370
Yeah.
And it tastes like
a peanut butter to me.

16:11.370 --> 16:12.305
‐Yeah.
‐Exactly.

16:12.305 --> 16:13.673
‐Is it supposed to?
‐Yeah.

16:13.673 --> 16:15.942
Yeah, it's supposed to have
that texture of the nut butter.

16:15.942 --> 16:18.110
And you kind of use it
the same way.
Mmm!

16:18.110 --> 16:20.012
But it has that taste
of granola.

16:20.012 --> 16:21.581
It's almost soup‐like.

16:21.581 --> 16:24.183
I mean, is that gonna be
a pushback from consumers?

16:24.183 --> 16:26.085
Yeah, so it's slightly
more spreadable

16:26.085 --> 16:27.820
and drizzly than
a normal peanut butter.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.323
Is that intentional, or is it
because of your ingredients?
But not a lot.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.958
Yeah, it's intentional.

16:31.958 --> 16:34.126
I mean, most people like it
that way so they can drizzle it

16:34.126 --> 16:36.095
on yogurt bowls
and smoothies

16:36.095 --> 16:37.997
and acai bowls
and stuff like that.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.799
Guys, what is
your relationship?

16:39.799 --> 16:41.334
So, Eric and I are dating.

16:41.334 --> 16:42.768
We've been dating
for about eight years,

16:42.768 --> 16:44.470
so he's wifed up
at this point.

16:44.470 --> 16:46.372
What are you waiting for,
Eric?

16:46.372 --> 16:47.573
That's a good question.

16:47.573 --> 16:49.942
And then Ari and Eric
are childhood friends.

16:49.942 --> 16:51.544
How did you come up
with this idea?

16:51.544 --> 16:52.745
Granola Butter
actually came out of

16:52.745 --> 16:54.680
my eating‐disorder recovery.

16:54.680 --> 16:57.917
So I struggled with food
and my body for over a decade,

16:57.917 --> 17:01.153
particularly anorexia,
binge eating and orthorexia...

17:01.153 --> 17:03.689
My gosh.
...which is sort of like eating
healthy taken to the extreme.

17:03.689 --> 17:06.726
So it's an obsession with eating
perfectly clean all the time.

17:06.726 --> 17:09.428
So one day, I just hit
my rock bottom

17:09.428 --> 17:10.930
and decided to reach out
for help,

17:10.930 --> 17:13.766
found an incredible therapist
who really set me up

17:13.766 --> 17:16.269
on this journey
of self‐love and food freedom.

17:16.269 --> 17:19.105
And I did what any millennial
would do in my situation,

17:19.105 --> 17:21.040
which was I started
an Instagram account

17:21.040 --> 17:22.842
to document my entire journey.

17:22.842 --> 17:24.510
I bet you helped
a lot of people, Ali.

17:24.510 --> 17:25.878
Yeah, thank you.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.980
I'm excited to share my story
because I felt so alone

17:27.980 --> 17:29.882
when I was going through it.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.851
And so if one person watching,
you know,

17:31.851 --> 17:34.520
hopefully I can help them
feel less alone and ‐‐

17:34.520 --> 17:38.024
Now, Ali, was then
this granola butter...

17:38.024 --> 17:40.660
Yeah.
...something you said it came
out of that journey?

17:40.660 --> 17:42.028
‐Definitely. Yeah.
‐Explain.

17:42.028 --> 17:43.829
So, where the granola butter
comes in is, you know,

17:43.829 --> 17:45.031
part of my recovery journey

17:45.031 --> 17:47.366
was adding my fear foods
back into my diet.

17:47.366 --> 17:50.036
So, for me, that was peanut
butter and almond butter,

17:50.036 --> 17:52.338
because they're a little more
calorically dense,

17:52.338 --> 17:54.240
and so I avoided them
for a really long time.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.309
And as I started
to add them back in,

17:56.309 --> 17:58.678
my gut couldn't handle
all of the nuts, unfortunately.

17:58.678 --> 18:00.846
So I started to explore
some of the nut‐free options.

18:00.846 --> 18:02.515
But for me, personally,
they just didn't resonate

18:02.515 --> 18:03.849
with me that much.

18:03.849 --> 18:05.418
And so I was in
my tiny SF kitchen

18:05.418 --> 18:07.353
with just, like,
a blender, some granola,

18:07.353 --> 18:09.855
and I had this epiphany
to do an oat‐based spread.

18:09.855 --> 18:12.992
And I saw what oat milk had done
and just exploded,

18:12.992 --> 18:15.461
and I was so shocked that no one
had done an oat‐based spread.

18:15.461 --> 18:16.796
So that's where
the idea was born.

18:16.796 --> 18:18.130
And then we brought Ari in,

18:18.130 --> 18:21.601
and he put the chef's kiss
final touches on it.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.302
Can you break down
the numbers for me?

18:23.302 --> 18:25.338
So, lifetime sales
of the business,

18:25.338 --> 18:27.607
we've done $2.7 million.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.809
‐Cash money!
‐And...

18:29.809 --> 18:31.410
Over what period of time?

18:31.410 --> 18:33.813
So we launched
in March of 2018.

18:33.813 --> 18:36.716
The first year, we did
about $156,000 in sales.

18:36.716 --> 18:39.218
The next year,
we did $435,000.

18:39.218 --> 18:42.088
Last year,
we did $1.2 million.
Wow.

18:42.088 --> 18:43.723
And that was with
a marketing spend

18:43.723 --> 18:46.058
of less than 5%
of our gross revenue.
Good for you.

18:46.058 --> 18:47.193
‐Wow!
‐That's a lot.

18:47.193 --> 18:48.260
‐Thank you.
‐That's great.

18:48.260 --> 18:49.629
And we're looking
to close this year out

18:49.629 --> 18:50.896
at about $2.5 million.

18:50.896 --> 18:52.431
How much money
have you guys raised?

18:52.431 --> 18:54.400
So we actually
bootstrapped the business

18:54.400 --> 18:55.668
for the first two years.

18:55.668 --> 18:57.370
We put about 100K
of our own money

18:57.370 --> 19:00.206
and raised 600K
on a convertible note.

19:00.206 --> 19:01.507
What valuation?

19:01.507 --> 19:05.444
So we raised that at partially
on a $5 million cap

19:05.444 --> 19:07.713
and partially on
a $6 million cap.

19:07.713 --> 19:09.482
The first part of that
was our true friends and family,

19:09.482 --> 19:11.751
and the second piece of that
was from founders

19:11.751 --> 19:13.753
who've had successful exits
in the space.

19:13.753 --> 19:16.055
Tara Bosch, who's the founder
of SmartSweets ‐‐

19:16.055 --> 19:17.289
she was a solo founder...
Bonar: Yeah.

19:17.289 --> 19:18.658
...and ended up selling
her business

19:18.658 --> 19:20.926
for over $300 million
in just four years.

19:20.926 --> 19:23.229
We have Jake Kasson,
who bootstrapped his way

19:23.229 --> 19:25.631
to one of the most successful
e‐commerce businesses,

19:25.631 --> 19:28.034
MVMT Watches,
and they also had an exit

19:28.034 --> 19:29.535
for over $300 million.

19:29.535 --> 19:30.670
So what is
the cost structure?

19:30.670 --> 19:32.571
What does it cost you
to make a jar?

19:32.571 --> 19:34.140
Yeah, so it costs us
on average

19:34.140 --> 19:36.742
$3.25
to manufacture a jar.

19:36.742 --> 19:41.447
We sell a jar for between
$9 and $12.95 on our site.

19:41.447 --> 19:42.815
Ooh.
To distributors,

19:42.815 --> 19:45.785
we sell for
a little under $5.50.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.019
And then
that lands on shelves

19:47.019 --> 19:49.488
between $8.99
and $11.99.

19:49.488 --> 19:52.658
So when you walk into a store,
what is it about it,

19:52.658 --> 19:55.294
as opposed to all the
competitors that are out there,

19:55.294 --> 19:56.328

stand out

want to sample it?

19:57.697 --> 19:59.799

the genesis of this story.

24:42.848 --> 24:43.916
[ Laughter ]

24:43.916 --> 24:46.719
So, I'm a hairdresser
by trade,

24:46.719 --> 24:48.754
and I was doing
a lot of weddings,

24:48.754 --> 24:50.489
and I watched
all the girls getting ready,

24:50.489 --> 24:52.091
doing their hair,
and drinking

24:52.091 --> 24:53.726
and then out the door

24:53.726 --> 24:54.994
with their flowers
in their hand.

24:54.994 --> 24:58.864
And that was my moment.
I came home and I said to Ryan,

24:58.864 --> 25:02.334
"I've got something.
We've gotta do this."

25:02.334 --> 25:04.136
And I made a prototype
that night.

25:04.136 --> 25:06.772
And I used my baby's
formula bottle,

25:06.772 --> 25:09.174
a plastic martini glass.

25:09.174 --> 25:11.110
‐Kelly and Ryan...
‐All right, so Kelly ‐‐

25:11.110 --> 25:13.212
...you're proof that
anybody that says

25:13.212 --> 25:15.214
America is not the greatest
country in the world

25:15.214 --> 25:17.416
with the most creative
entrepreneurs,

25:17.416 --> 25:18.951
you prove them wrong.
Ryan: Thank you!

25:18.951 --> 25:21.820
Greiner: Kelly, tell me ‐‐
let me see the product by itself

25:21.820 --> 25:24.857
so that we know, under
the flowers, what's happening.

25:24.857 --> 25:28.427
Where does the wine
or the alcohol go or the water?

25:28.427 --> 25:31.230
It goes underneath, and it's
completely sectioned off?

25:31.230 --> 25:32.564
‐Yes.
‐Yes.

25:32.564 --> 25:34.333
So the flowers are not touching
your drink at all?

25:34.333 --> 25:36.335
‐No.
‐Are you selling any of these?

25:36.335 --> 25:39.238
Our sales are $21,000.

25:39.238 --> 25:40.472
And how long have you
been selling them,

25:40.472 --> 25:41.507
and what do they sell for?

25:41.507 --> 25:42.708
‐Yeah, how long?
‐They sell for $20.

25:42.708 --> 25:44.777
They cost me $1.77
to make.

25:44.777 --> 25:46.512
Yeah!

25:46.512 --> 25:48.213
And do you make them in the USA,
or where?

25:48.213 --> 25:49.815
They are 100%
made in the USA.

25:49.815 --> 25:51.483
‐That's very cool.
‐Kelly, how do you sell them?

25:51.483 --> 25:53.619
Is it all online?
Just online.

to make the mold

What did you have to
invest in this?

32:04.956 --> 32:07.192
How many calories
per chopstick?

32:07.192 --> 32:09.261
Chopsticks are
about 15 calories.

32:09.261 --> 32:12.431
I had one spoon here,
and it was fantastic.

32:12.431 --> 32:14.599
It was like a spicy pizza...

32:14.599 --> 32:16.234
‐Yeah.
‐...flavored breadstick.

32:16.234 --> 32:19.371
Corcoran: Tomato spicy.
I would actually want to buy
and eat these...

32:19.371 --> 32:21.139
‐Uh‐huh.
‐...not even as the utensil.

32:21.139 --> 32:23.975
Then this one was in ice cream,
and this one has...

32:23.975 --> 32:25.210
‐They have different flavors.
‐...a vanilla flavor,

32:25.210 --> 32:27.078
and it tastes like
a waffle cone.

32:27.078 --> 32:29.047
So this is delicious.

32:29.047 --> 32:31.216
Then we have here ‐‐
what is this one?

32:31.216 --> 32:33.218
‐That's a straw.
‐And what's the flavor?

32:33.218 --> 32:34.386
It's actually flavorless.

32:34.386 --> 32:36.688
So you are concerned about
the flavor of these,

32:36.688 --> 32:38.790
in addition
to their functionality.

32:38.790 --> 32:41.460
So our concept is
to keep them subtle,

32:41.460 --> 32:43.995
because our initial first year
of our sales

32:43.995 --> 32:46.231
is completely focused
on food service,

32:46.231 --> 32:48.900
because that's where the
heaviest usage of plastic is,

32:48.900 --> 32:51.303
and they wanted it to be very
subtle, not too overbearing,

32:51.303 --> 32:53.305
because they don't want to
change the food you eat with.

32:53.305 --> 32:55.540
Right.
What is the cost for you
to make it,

32:55.540 --> 32:56.708
and what are you
selling it for?

32:56.708 --> 32:59.110
About 20 cents
to buy the spoon.

32:59.110 --> 33:00.679
And our cost of goods
is 10 cents.

33:00.679 --> 33:02.414
What cost differential
would it be

33:02.414 --> 33:04.983
between very large volume
of plastic spoons

33:04.983 --> 33:06.785
versus this edible spoon?

33:06.785 --> 33:10.555
Yes, a plastic spoon trends
around 1 to 2 cents per spoon.

33:10.555 --> 33:12.858
But our product
has a capability

33:12.858 --> 33:15.460
to make additional profits
to the company.

33:15.460 --> 33:18.663
Let's say, for example,
a very large ice cream chain

33:18.663 --> 33:20.232
ordered 100 million spoons.

33:20.232 --> 33:22.601
If they upsell it to
the consumer for 5 cents,

33:22.601 --> 33:25.103
they make $5 million profit,
and we also make profits.

33:25.103 --> 33:27.339
But what would it cost me
if I didn't want to upsell?

33:27.339 --> 33:30.342
As a large ice cream company,
I bought 100 million of these.

33:30.342 --> 33:32.444
What's my delta?
What's my difference in price?

33:32.444 --> 33:33.945
So we started with 35 cents.

33:33.945 --> 33:35.313
We already brought it down
to 20 cents.

33:35.313 --> 33:36.915
We're gonna bring it down
to 15 cents.

33:36.915 --> 33:39.918
‐That's pricey, I think.
‐But have you sold anything yet?

33:39.918 --> 33:43.154
I sold 1.2 million spoons
so far, 2 to 2 1/2 years.

33:43.154 --> 33:44.289
What's that in dollars?

33:44.289 --> 33:47.158
$170,000.

33:47.158 --> 33:49.060
That's it?

33:49.060 --> 33:50.629
And where are you selling them?

33:50.629 --> 33:54.099
Yeah, so 2019, we're just
completely B2B food service,

33:54.099 --> 33:56.101
because that's where
most of the plastic is.

33:56.101 --> 33:58.937
And we were going great.
We had amazing traction.

33:58.937 --> 34:00.071
And then the COVID hit,

34:00.071 --> 34:01.740
and that was given opportunity
for us,

34:01.740 --> 34:04.676
because we could explore B2C
and direct to consumer.

34:04.676 --> 34:07.012
I spent two weekends,
read six books,

34:07.012 --> 34:09.915
designed my own packaging,
designed my own website.

34:09.915 --> 34:12.717
You don't know when you see this
that it is edible.

34:12.717 --> 34:14.352
Nobody knows that
till you tell them,

34:14.352 --> 34:15.887
so there's a fair amount
of education

34:15.887 --> 34:17.355
that's gonna
have to happen.

34:17.355 --> 34:19.291
And going to the side
of scale here,

34:19.291 --> 34:20.892
when you talked about
100 million pieces ‐‐

34:20.892 --> 34:22.627
and I'm the ice cream,
whatever it is,

34:22.627 --> 34:24.796
the B2B play,
business‐to‐business,

34:24.796 --> 34:25.997
I'm gonna have to
ask myself,

34:25.997 --> 34:28.867
"Do I want to pay 2 cents
for the plastic,

34:28.867 --> 34:30.869
or do I want to pay
10 times more for this

34:30.869 --> 34:32.170
and then educate everybody

34:32.170 --> 34:33.605
that not only
can you eat the ice cream,

34:33.605 --> 34:35.507
you can eat the spoon
that you scooped it with.
Ice cream.

34:35.507 --> 34:37.075
There's a lot of work there.
It's cheaper.

34:37.075 --> 34:38.176
Well, wait a minute.

34:38.176 --> 34:39.811
If you were creative,
you would know

34:39.811 --> 34:42.781
that you can impression
an imprint into the spoon...
Cuban: Right.

34:42.781 --> 34:44.549
...and into every piece
that says, "Eat me."

34:44.549 --> 34:46.284
But do I want to pay
20 times more,

34:46.284 --> 34:48.520
whether it has that sign
"Eat me" on it or not?

34:48.520 --> 34:50.722
Dinesh, you seem so excited
to be here today.

34:50.722 --> 34:52.757
[ Chuckles ] Yeah.
So this is my dream to be here.

34:52.757 --> 34:55.393
I'm an immigrant from India,
and I still work,

34:55.393 --> 34:58.630
and I've been hustling this
from like 7:00 p. m. to 2:00 a. m.

34:58.630 --> 35:00.999
every single day
for the past two and half years.

35:00.999 --> 35:03.702
And I feel so proud
that I reduced or replaced

35:03.702 --> 35:05.103
one million plastic utensils,
and...

35:05.103 --> 35:07.539
‐Mm‐hmm.
‐You should be.

35:07.539 --> 35:09.040
And I found
the purpose of my life.
Yeah, you should be.

35:09.040 --> 35:11.576
I found the purpose of my life.
That's what makes me more happy.

35:11.576 --> 35:13.111
There's 100 million
plastic utensils

35:13.111 --> 35:14.813
disposed of every single day.

35:14.813 --> 35:16.481
And with our patent and IP,

35:16.481 --> 35:17.949
our company's gonna change
the planet

35:17.949 --> 35:19.484
and the way people
eat their food.

35:19.484 --> 35:20.752
Okay,
let's go back to money,

35:20.752 --> 35:22.520
'cause that's a serious
chunk of change.

35:22.520 --> 35:24.122
I'd really love
to know your background.

35:24.122 --> 35:27.192
I love all this stuff about,
you know, how wonderful it is,

35:27.192 --> 35:28.360
but I want to find out
if I can make any money.

35:28.360 --> 35:29.894
You will love it more
after learning about me.

35:29.894 --> 35:31.229
Money, money,
money, money.

35:31.229 --> 35:32.797
‐Let's quit on Kevin.
‐I will come back to money.

35:32.797 --> 35:35.600
Kevin, it's very important.
I know money is most valuable.

35:35.600 --> 35:38.003
So, okay, so Lori,
I was born in India,

35:38.003 --> 35:40.839
and my dad taught me the value
of content and happiness,

35:40.839 --> 35:43.241
and he said,
"Happiness is here, not here."

35:43.241 --> 35:45.477
So I came to the U. S.
for my master's,

35:45.477 --> 35:46.711
and then I graduated.

35:46.711 --> 35:47.912
I started working
at a technology company

35:47.912 --> 35:49.080
in the Bay Area.

35:49.080 --> 35:51.683
‐Your master's was in?
‐Electrical engineering.

35:51.683 --> 35:53.618
I decided I have to
take care of this,

35:53.618 --> 35:55.453
because my kid's future
is at stake.

35:55.453 --> 35:56.821
‐Right.
‐It's not about me.

35:56.821 --> 35:59.891
Like, yes, money is nice.
Money is good to have.

35:59.891 --> 36:02.060
But imagine
one ice cream chain

36:02.060 --> 36:03.561
or one restaurant chain

36:03.561 --> 36:06.264
changing this to edible cutlery
and making money.

36:06.264 --> 36:10.001
It's gonna revolutionize
the entire world.

36:10.001 --> 36:12.937
Your enthusiasm is
so absolutely delicious,

36:12.937 --> 36:16.541
but I feel that you're blinded
by your own enthusiasm.

36:18.243 --> 36:20.879
I think you're asking
a lot of a restaurant

36:20.879 --> 36:23.982
to go into the spoon‐selling
business, as well,

36:23.982 --> 36:26.084
and to take their
maybe 1 cent

36:26.084 --> 36:28.053
or even half‐cent
cost of their spoon

36:28.053 --> 36:30.321
and up it
to 20 cents a spoon.

36:30.321 --> 36:33.825
And so I think you have
a lot of challenges there

36:33.825 --> 36:36.895
that are against the norm
and super‐creative,

36:36.895 --> 36:38.630
which I commend you for.

36:38.630 --> 36:41.032
But I'm not sure
they're practical enough to fly.

36:41.032 --> 36:43.134
And so for those reasons,
I'm out.

36:45.136 --> 36:47.605
Dinesh, I disagree with Barbara
on that point,

36:47.605 --> 36:48.707
and let me tell you why.

36:48.707 --> 36:50.475
That passion is exactly

36:50.475 --> 36:52.410
what's gonna
make you succeed.

36:52.410 --> 36:55.246
The reason why
I'm struggling is,

36:55.246 --> 36:59.984
you know, you have not proven
that this really cool concept

36:59.984 --> 37:02.353
is scalable to the point
that Mr. Wonderful says.

37:02.353 --> 37:03.888
But you've imputed
a valuation

37:03.888 --> 37:05.557
that's proven
that it's scalable.

37:05.557 --> 37:07.592
The gap between your vision

37:07.592 --> 37:10.462
and your expectations from us
as investors is way too,

37:10.462 --> 37:11.896
way, way, way too high.

37:11.896 --> 37:13.998
I have to valuate it
not as a dream,

37:13.998 --> 37:18.203
but as a business
with $170,000 in lifetime sales.

37:18.203 --> 37:20.805
It's not worth $7.1 million.

37:20.805 --> 37:23.041
So, Daniel, I have not spent
anything on marketing.

37:23.041 --> 37:25.143
I have a huge capability
of making it viral

37:25.143 --> 37:26.845
because it's such
interesting product.

37:26.845 --> 37:29.848
I just spent two years to make
the best product that there is.

37:29.848 --> 37:31.249
I think you're gonna win,

37:31.249 --> 37:34.352
but I'm not gonna come in as
an investor at this valuation.

37:35.620 --> 37:37.122
I'm sorry, but I'm out.

37:37.122 --> 37:38.923
Thank you.
Thank you for time.

37:38.923 --> 37:40.825
I really wish
you can think again.

37:40.825 --> 37:43.862
I mean, to me,
the idea is brilliant,

37:43.862 --> 37:45.263
and I love engineers,

37:45.263 --> 37:47.198
and I'm sure your journey
got you to where you are

37:47.198 --> 37:49.100
'cause you're passionate.
I believe all that.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.368
But I am, like Daniel,

37:50.368 --> 37:53.838
choking on
this $7.1 million valuation.

37:53.838 --> 37:55.874
I like you,
but there's no way on Earth

37:55.874 --> 37:58.042
I'm giving you
half a million dollars for 7%.

37:58.042 --> 38:00.311
You said you are from
the planet Earth. So am I.

38:00.311 --> 38:01.946
Your deal's
from the planet Zootron.

38:01.946 --> 38:03.982
That's the problem.
Makes no sense.

38:03.982 --> 38:05.784
I'll give you
the $500,000.

38:05.784 --> 38:08.052
I want 35% of the company.

38:08.052 --> 38:10.655
That's about
the right deal.

38:10.655 --> 38:11.956
Thanks for the offer,
Kevin.

38:11.956 --> 38:13.458
Dinesh, you're thinking
too small.

38:15.059 --> 38:18.296
You've got this
game‐changer‐type product

38:18.296 --> 38:20.465
that made me ask myself,
"Why didn't I think of that?"

38:20.465 --> 38:25.069
♪♪

38:31.342 --> 38:33.011
Narrator:
Two Sharks are out.

38:33.011 --> 38:35.280
Dinesh has an offer
on the table from Kevin

38:35.280 --> 38:38.416
for his edible utensil company,
IncrEDIBLE Eats.

38:38.416 --> 38:41.352
And Mark also seems interested.

38:41.352 --> 38:43.021
Dinesh, you're thinking
too small.

38:43.021 --> 38:46.591
You've got this
game‐changer‐type product

38:46.591 --> 38:48.960
that made me ask myself,
"Why didn't I think of that?"

38:48.960 --> 38:50.328
Because it makes
perfect sense.

38:50.328 --> 38:52.931
The brilliance of what you're
doing beyond the product

38:52.931 --> 38:55.600
is that every single online

38:55.600 --> 38:58.203
and in‐real‐world
brick‐and‐mortar company

38:58.203 --> 39:00.104
is always looking
for upsells

39:00.104 --> 39:03.374
that are relevant to the product
that's being sold underneath it.

39:03.374 --> 39:06.544
So if you buy a salad,
if you buy ice cream,

39:06.544 --> 39:09.347
if you buy whatever
at a grocery store,

39:09.347 --> 39:11.316
you're right next to
the prepackaged foods.

39:11.316 --> 39:13.585
And there it is ‐‐
want to save the planet?

39:13.585 --> 39:16.054
Put a barcode on it
and sell it individually.

39:16.054 --> 39:17.355
You just upsell it, right?

39:17.355 --> 39:19.157
So I'm gonna
make you an offer,

39:19.157 --> 39:20.725
but it's gonna take
a lot of my time.

39:20.725 --> 39:23.027
There's a lot of expense
involved from my end, right?

39:23.027 --> 39:24.896
So I'll offer you
the $500,000,

39:24.896 --> 39:27.532
but I want 20%.

39:27.532 --> 39:28.666
20%. I mean ‐‐

39:28.666 --> 39:30.034
I like my offer better.

39:30.034 --> 39:32.470
‐And I have an offer for you.
‐That's a super‐good deal.

39:32.470 --> 39:34.138
Mark is saying
you're not seeing it big enough.

39:34.138 --> 39:36.140
I think Mark's
not seeing it big enough.

39:36.140 --> 39:37.542
I see that
it could be in grocery.

39:37.542 --> 39:38.977
I see it could be upsell.

39:38.977 --> 39:42.113
I think it's a fantastic product
as it is.

39:42.113 --> 39:44.115
So I see it in grocery
everywhere

39:44.115 --> 39:46.317
right next to
the plastic utensils,

39:46.317 --> 39:49.254
but with revamped packaging
that just screams,

39:49.254 --> 39:51.856
"I'm delicious.
Eat me. Save the planet."

39:51.856 --> 39:55.460
But I also think that
you could be doing food service.

39:55.460 --> 39:58.830
I think you can be doing it all.
You just need the right...

39:58.830 --> 40:00.398
I'm not saying
don't do one or the other.

40:00.398 --> 40:02.267
I'm just saying
your path of least resistance.

40:02.267 --> 40:04.102
...the right Shark
in which to help you.
Is anybody else
doing this?

40:04.102 --> 40:05.637
‐Hello.
‐Sorry.

40:05.637 --> 40:07.038
You just need the right Shark
in which to help you

40:07.038 --> 40:08.573
blitz the market.

40:08.573 --> 40:09.807
And I'm that Shark.

40:09.807 --> 40:12.810
So here's what
I'm gonna offer you.

40:12.810 --> 40:16.547
