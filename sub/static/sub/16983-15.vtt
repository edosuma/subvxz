00:01.168 --> 00:03.068
To devout Hindus,

00:03.170 --> 00:06.505
Shiva is a real being who walked among us.

00:06.607 --> 00:09.174
Shiva came down

00:09.276 --> 00:11.577
from these cities on the firmament.

00:11.679 --> 00:14.446
He's the leader of a group
of extraterrestrials.

00:14.548 --> 00:17.649
Shiva was a force for incredible good,

00:17.752 --> 00:20.152
but also a force for
incredible destruction.

00:20.254 --> 00:24.123
And he is said to have this trident

00:24.225 --> 00:28.660
which could annihilate
anything in its path.

00:28.763 --> 00:29.928
In the Hindu tradition,

00:30.031 --> 00:33.665
you have to have destruction
in order to have creation.

00:33.768 --> 00:36.368
And it may be that Shiva will determine

00:36.470 --> 00:38.370
the future of the human race.

00:38.472 --> 00:41.840
Since the dawn of civilization,

00:41.942 --> 00:45.978
mankind has credited its origins to gods

00:46.080 --> 00:48.480
and other visitors from the stars.

00:48.582 --> 00:51.216
What if it were true?

00:51.318 --> 00:53.952
Did extraterrestrial beings

00:54.055 --> 00:57.289
really help to shape our history?

00:57.391 --> 01:00.125
And if so, might humanity's fate

01:00.227 --> 01:03.829
be determined by Shiva the Destroyer?

Original Air Date on September 2, 2016

01:34.862 --> 01:36.862
India.

01:36.964 --> 01:41.200
Covering over 1.2 million square miles,

01:41.302 --> 01:44.236
it is the world's
seventh-largest country.

01:44.338 --> 01:48.440
And with 1.3 billion people,

01:48.542 --> 01:50.509
it is the second most populated.

01:52.513 --> 01:57.316
Roughly 80% of the Indian
population practices Hinduism,

01:57.418 --> 02:01.053
the world's oldest surviving religion

02:01.155 --> 02:04.656
that dates back to at least 2000 BC.

02:04.758 --> 02:10.461
And for the Hindu faithful,
their gods are not mythological,

02:10.564 --> 02:12.464
but are real beings

02:12.566 --> 02:16.735
that have, at times,
been present here on Earth.

02:19.607 --> 02:23.575
These many gods and goddesses
have different stories

02:23.677 --> 02:25.010
and different energies

02:25.112 --> 02:28.747
and different principles
that they represent.

02:28.849 --> 02:32.751
For many of the Hindu faithful,
the gods are absolutely real.

02:32.853 --> 02:34.953
They exist physically,

02:35.055 --> 02:37.789
although they may not always be visible.

02:37.892 --> 02:41.460
In general, compared to
Western belief systems,

02:41.562 --> 02:45.597
the tangible reality of the gods
is much stronger in India.

02:45.699 --> 02:49.101
I've grown up as a Hindu
in a strict Hindu family,

02:49.203 --> 02:51.737
so I know all the Vedas and epics.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.739
You know, I've read them
hundreds of times.

02:53.841 --> 02:58.377
Hindus believe that the gods
came down from the sky.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.680
Hindus believe that

03:01.782 --> 03:05.484
these stories are not simply myth.

03:05.586 --> 03:07.186
They are historical records,

03:07.288 --> 03:10.889
because they are
actually called itihasa--

03:10.991 --> 03:13.825
itihasa meaning "history".

03:13.928 --> 03:17.229
While in the Judeo-Christian tradition,

03:17.331 --> 03:20.532
God is depicted as an all-powerful being,

03:20.634 --> 03:22.568
in the Vedic texts,

03:22.670 --> 03:27.105
Hindu gods often rely
on the use of technology.

03:27.208 --> 03:31.977
This has led ancient astronaut
theorists to pose the question:

03:32.079 --> 03:35.380
is it possible that
these religious texts

03:35.482 --> 03:38.784
describe not only
encounters with the divine,

03:38.886 --> 03:42.821
but also with extraterrestrial beings?

03:42.923 --> 03:46.825
The Western mindset
is different from that of India,

03:46.927 --> 03:49.928
where they accept the idea
of extraterrestrial beings.

03:50.030 --> 03:53.232
The Hindu story of the Mahabharata

03:53.334 --> 03:55.567
is loaded with references

03:55.669 --> 03:59.605
to what seems to be
extraterrestrial technology.

03:59.707 --> 04:02.541
You've got flying vehicles.

04:02.643 --> 04:05.844
You've got weapons
that are voice-activated.

04:05.946 --> 04:08.614
And you have destructions
of civilizations

04:08.716 --> 04:11.483
by what seems like nuclear detonation.

04:12.886 --> 04:15.487
In the Mahabharata,

04:15.589 --> 04:18.790
there they write that one day

04:18.892 --> 04:22.394
gigantic cities surrounded the Earth.

04:22.496 --> 04:25.364
They did not have a word for
"spaceship" at that time.

04:25.466 --> 04:27.366
They say "cities".

04:27.468 --> 04:29.334
And they make clear difference

04:29.436 --> 04:33.472
that these cities were in
the firmament, not in heaven.

04:33.574 --> 04:35.807
And small vehicles came down

04:35.909 --> 04:38.343
from these cities of the firmament.

04:38.445 --> 04:41.847
The old Indians called
these vehicles vimanas.

04:41.949 --> 04:46.451
And out of the vimanas,
the teachers came out.

04:46.553 --> 04:51.323
No doubt we were visited
by extraterrestrials.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.859
Is the Hindu tradition

04:53.961 --> 04:57.663
a story of extraterrestrial visitation?

04:57.765 --> 05:00.532
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes,

05:00.634 --> 05:03.201
and suggest that this was orchestrated

05:03.304 --> 05:07.973
by an otherworldly being known
in Hinduism as Lord Shiva.

05:09.810 --> 05:12.110
Shiva is Shiva is also called Mahadeva.

05:12.212 --> 05:15.514
Mahadeva means "great god".

05:15.616 --> 05:18.083
So he is god of gods.

05:18.185 --> 05:20.452
He's the head of all gods,

05:20.554 --> 05:24.022
and he's also the most powerful god.

05:24.124 --> 05:25.857
Shiva has a dual function.

05:25.959 --> 05:28.827
One of his functions is destruction.

05:28.929 --> 05:31.063
The other one is creation.

05:31.165 --> 05:35.033
Without destruction,
there is no creation.

05:35.135 --> 05:37.336
Depictions of Shiva embody

05:37.438 --> 05:41.306
this idea of destruction and creation.

05:41.408 --> 05:46.745
Shiva is most often shown
holding a drum called a damaru,

05:46.847 --> 05:49.247
which he used to create the universe.

05:49.350 --> 05:53.652
Around his neck is a
cobra poised to strike.

05:53.754 --> 05:58.523
In one hand, Shiva holds
a powerful trident-like

05:58.625 --> 06:01.660
weapon of destruction
called the trishula,

06:01.762 --> 06:05.831
and in the center of his
forehead, he has a third eye.

06:07.634 --> 06:10.102
Shiva is the only god that has a...

06:10.204 --> 06:12.137
depicted with third eye.

06:12.239 --> 06:15.073
If his third eye opens,

06:15.175 --> 06:19.678
a very powerful light, uh,
fire emits from his third eye,

06:19.780 --> 06:24.883
and anything that it sees,
it destroys totally.

06:24.985 --> 06:27.652
Usually, when you talk
about the third eye,

06:27.755 --> 06:29.921
it's about enlightenment.

06:30.023 --> 06:32.057
And then there is this other third eye,

06:32.159 --> 06:36.027
this third eye that was able
to annihilate things.

06:36.130 --> 06:38.997
I don't think they're the same thing.

06:39.099 --> 06:41.666
So the question is: What was it?

06:41.769 --> 06:43.668
And what was Shiva?

06:45.472 --> 06:49.074
Shiva appeared at a very crucial time

06:49.176 --> 06:51.109
when, uh, two gods--

06:51.211 --> 06:54.312
Brahma is the creator,
and Vishnu, the preserver--

06:54.415 --> 06:57.349
were debating who is greater.

06:57.451 --> 07:01.386
All of a sudden, this blinding
light, shaft of light,

07:01.488 --> 07:04.956
appeared that has no end or beginning.

07:05.058 --> 07:08.226
And then this voice
came out of this light,

07:08.328 --> 07:10.829
said that, "I am the greatest.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.964
I am the greatest god there is."

07:13.066 --> 07:16.301
Shiva is almost always surrounded

07:16.403 --> 07:19.905
by some type of a circular
structure with flames.

07:20.007 --> 07:24.142
Now, what did our human ancestor
artists try to depict here?

07:24.244 --> 07:29.815
Was he perhaps inside
some type of a fiery craft?

07:29.917 --> 07:35.654
It is possible that Shiva
is the same extraterrestrial

07:35.756 --> 07:38.657
that other cultures
call by different names.

07:38.759 --> 07:41.059
Enki, Odin, Zeus,

07:41.161 --> 07:43.962
Viracocha, Quetzalcoatl, Kukulkan.

07:46.200 --> 07:48.166
The earliest Vedic texts

07:48.268 --> 07:51.670
were first written
roughly 4,000 years ago,

07:51.772 --> 07:55.207
but Hindus claim that
the stories originated

07:55.309 --> 07:59.411
hundreds and perhaps even
thousands of years earlier,

07:59.513 --> 08:02.747
existing as part of an oral tradition

08:02.850 --> 08:06.151
passed down from one
generation to the next.

08:06.253 --> 08:10.322
And ancient astronaut theorists suggest

08:10.424 --> 08:13.158
that Shiva first arrived here on Earth

08:13.260 --> 08:16.895
at a time before the existence
of modern humans,

08:16.997 --> 08:20.165
and before the event known,
in the Biblical tradition,

08:20.267 --> 08:21.967
as the Great Flood.

08:24.404 --> 08:26.471
Every culture around the world

08:26.573 --> 08:28.773
that has any type of ancient writings

08:28.876 --> 08:31.009
or documents or even oral traditions,

08:31.111 --> 08:34.779
they always talk about
some kind of great flood...

08:38.684 --> 08:42.953
that had a massive catastrophic effect,

08:43.056 --> 08:45.657
and utterly wiped out

08:45.759 --> 08:49.060
much of life on Earth in a single day.

08:49.162 --> 08:52.163
What I find interesting about this

08:52.266 --> 08:55.066
is that Shiva is the god of destruction.

08:55.168 --> 08:58.403
In the Hindu tradition,
you have to have destruction

08:58.505 --> 09:00.472
in order to have creation.

09:01.875 --> 09:05.243
Is there a connection there?

09:07.014 --> 09:10.015
Tibetan lamas claim that,
after the Flood,

09:10.117 --> 09:12.117
when the whole Earth flooded,

09:12.219 --> 09:16.821
and the waters gradually receded,

09:16.924 --> 09:20.191
man was created anew

09:20.294 --> 09:24.529
by means of the seed
that was guarded by Shiva.

09:29.469 --> 09:30.969
Is it possible

09:31.071 --> 09:33.972
that Shiva was
an extraterrestrial visitor

09:34.074 --> 09:37.542
that was responsible for both
the creation and destruction

09:37.644 --> 09:40.345
of an earlier race of Earthlings?

09:40.447 --> 09:43.181
And if so, did he do this

09:43.283 --> 09:45.984
to clear the way for modern humans?

09:46.086 --> 09:49.521
Ancient astronaut theorists suggest

09:49.623 --> 09:53.658
further clues can be found
by examining a mysterious temple

09:53.760 --> 09:58.096
in northern India and
what might lie beneath it.

10:01.368 --> 10:03.168
One of the more mysterious aspects

10:03.270 --> 10:09.007
of the site of Ellora are the tunnels.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.508
Tunnels like these

10:10.611 --> 10:13.445
lead to a vast city under Kailasa Temple.

10:20.045 --> 10:23.547
Aurangabad, India.

10:23.616 --> 10:27.117
200 miles northeast of Mumbai

10:27.219 --> 10:29.620
stands a monolithic temple complex

10:29.688 --> 10:32.923
known as the Ellora Caves.

10:33.025 --> 10:37.160
These 34 sites of worship,
extending over a mile,

10:37.263 --> 10:39.429
were carved out of a high cliff,

10:39.531 --> 10:45.969
and are believed to date back
to between 600 and 1000 AD.

10:48.240 --> 10:51.642
Cave 16, known as Kailasa Temple,

10:51.710 --> 10:55.078
is a massive shrine to Lord Shiva.

10:55.180 --> 10:59.349
At three stories high,
it stands twice as tall

10:59.451 --> 11:02.085
as the Parthenon in Athens,

11:02.187 --> 11:06.290
and archaeologists believe it
was chiseled out of the hillside

11:06.358 --> 11:10.093
starting at the top
and ending at the bottom.

11:10.162 --> 11:14.331
Some historians estimate
that construction of the temple

11:14.433 --> 11:19.169
required the removal of
over 400,000 tons of rock,

11:19.271 --> 11:23.140
but even more incredible is
that mainstream archaeologists

11:23.242 --> 11:28.412
propose that this feat was
accomplished in just 18 years.

11:31.717 --> 11:35.719
If people worked every day
for that 18 years,

11:35.821 --> 11:38.455
for 12 hours straight with no breaks,

11:38.557 --> 11:41.591
then they would have to have removed

11:41.694 --> 11:44.061
five tons of rock every hour.

11:44.163 --> 11:49.099
This is ten thousand pounds
of rock every hour.

11:49.201 --> 11:53.503
In reality, such a feat
is not even possible today

11:53.572 --> 11:56.506
with modern technology.

11:56.608 --> 11:58.208
If it happened in 18 years,

11:58.277 --> 12:00.477
it is very hard to account for...

12:21.834 --> 12:26.269
Another baffling fact
is that if they removed

12:26.372 --> 12:28.472
400,000 tons of rocks,

12:28.574 --> 12:31.241
they have to be thrown away somewhere.

12:31.310 --> 12:36.680
But we do not find any evidence
of rocks being piled up nearby.

12:36.782 --> 12:39.616
Uh, it hasn't been used
to build any other temples

12:39.685 --> 12:41.451
or any other structure.

12:41.553 --> 12:43.186
Where did all that rock go?

12:45.724 --> 12:49.292
Could humans living over 1,000 years ago

12:49.395 --> 12:52.496
really have constructed Kailasa Temple

12:52.598 --> 12:55.532
in only 18 years?

12:55.601 --> 13:00.303
And if so, how is it that all
the rock that was excavated

13:00.406 --> 13:03.306
has simply disappeared?

13:04.877 --> 13:08.278
Perhaps further clues
can be found by examining

13:08.380 --> 13:12.482
a powerful device described
in the ancient Vedic texts.

13:14.019 --> 13:18.321
Interestingly, there is
a device called Bhaumastra

13:18.424 --> 13:20.624
mentioned in the ancient Vedic texts.

13:20.692 --> 13:25.796
This high-tech machine
would be able to quickly drill

13:25.898 --> 13:30.400
into the rock and basically vaporize them.

13:30.502 --> 13:35.138
This could basically
change the rock into air.

13:35.240 --> 13:38.108
This device was mentioned multiple times

13:38.210 --> 13:41.678
in ancient Vedic texts,
which was used to mine

13:41.780 --> 13:43.647
for precious stones and metals.

13:43.715 --> 13:47.517
Could this be how
Kailasa Temple was built?

13:47.619 --> 13:51.388
Is it possible that the Bhaumastra machine

13:51.490 --> 13:53.723
described in the Vedic texts

13:53.792 --> 13:56.092
was really a technological device

13:56.161 --> 14:01.064
that existed on Earth
thousands of years ago?

14:01.166 --> 14:04.201
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes,

14:04.269 --> 14:08.538
but suggest it was used
not to build Kailasa Temple

14:08.640 --> 14:12.943
from the top down,
as mainstream scholars propose,

14:13.045 --> 14:16.413
but carved out the structure
from the bottom up.

14:20.152 --> 14:21.651
One of the more mysterious aspects

14:21.720 --> 14:24.688
of the site of Ellora

14:24.790 --> 14:29.559
are the tunnels that seem
to go nowhere at the site.

14:29.628 --> 14:32.863
Some of them turn at odd angles.

14:32.965 --> 14:35.365
Some go as deep as 40 feet.

14:35.434 --> 14:38.735
Now the reasons for this are,
for the most part, unknown.

14:38.837 --> 14:41.605
This is one of the tunnels

14:41.707 --> 14:44.207
leading underground at the Kailasa Temple.

14:44.276 --> 14:45.809
You can see that the local authorities

14:45.911 --> 14:47.210
have fenced this off.

14:47.279 --> 14:48.812
But if you look through this hole,

14:48.914 --> 14:53.216
you can see that this tunnel
goes vertically down.

14:53.285 --> 14:57.687
Local authorities believe
that tunnels like these

14:57.756 --> 15:02.259
lead to a vast underground city
under Kailasa Temple.

15:04.196 --> 15:05.795
What could be the purpose

15:05.898 --> 15:09.399
for these tunnels below Kailasa Temple?

15:09.468 --> 15:12.669
And why are they fenced off
from the public?

15:15.374 --> 15:19.209
In 1876, renowned English spiritualist

15:19.311 --> 15:23.013
Emma Hardinge Britten
published Ghost Land,

15:23.115 --> 15:25.482
in which she writes of hidden tunnels

15:25.584 --> 15:27.717
beneath the Ellora Caves

15:27.819 --> 15:30.687
and the meetings of
a secret cabal of mystics

15:30.756 --> 15:33.023
in an underground city.

15:33.125 --> 15:37.727
Britten tells of spiritually
contacting a mysterious figure

15:37.829 --> 15:39.362
named Cavalier Louie,

15:39.464 --> 15:42.599
who witnessed the clandestine society.

15:42.668 --> 15:46.603
Cavalier Louie states that he was taken

15:46.672 --> 15:50.874
into the site of Ellora,
where he was led through

15:50.943 --> 15:55.445
a secret passageway into
an underground chamber.

15:55.514 --> 16:00.483
The underground chamber opened
up into a huge amphitheater,

16:00.586 --> 16:05.055
and there were these
wondrous metallic thrones

16:05.157 --> 16:09.926
that were being charged with
powerful galvanic batteries

16:10.028 --> 16:13.296
that rose up into the air.

16:13.398 --> 16:14.831
And seated on these thrones

16:14.933 --> 16:19.502
were seven mysterious hooded figures.

16:19.605 --> 16:22.839
But the most interesting one

16:22.941 --> 16:25.909
was the one in the center who spoke,

16:25.978 --> 16:29.079
and yet was not always there.

16:29.147 --> 16:33.083
His body shimmered in and out
of physical space and time.

16:40.759 --> 16:43.994
But why would vast
rooms and tunnels exist

16:44.062 --> 16:47.597
deep underground beneath Kailasa Temple?

16:49.901 --> 16:52.636
Ancient astronaut theorists suggest

16:52.704 --> 16:55.739
this could be further
evidence that Lord Shiva

16:55.807 --> 16:59.075
has a connection with the Great Flood.

17:02.347 --> 17:04.948
We have a great deluge

17:05.050 --> 17:07.851
that changed the face of the Earth

17:07.953 --> 17:11.788
and forced people underground.

17:11.890 --> 17:14.156
So you have to wonder,

17:14.259 --> 17:17.327
is this some kind of ancient city,

17:17.429 --> 17:19.362
many thousands of years old,

17:19.464 --> 17:22.999
that was once some kind
of extraterrestrial base?

17:23.101 --> 17:25.801
And as the water receded,

17:25.904 --> 17:28.805
they create this temple from underground.

17:31.810 --> 17:34.944
Presently, archaeologists
date the Kailasa Temple

17:35.013 --> 17:37.881
from the fifth to the tenth century AD.

17:37.983 --> 17:40.517
But there is nothing in the temple

17:40.619 --> 17:42.819
that really gives it a date.

17:42.921 --> 17:46.489
And, in fact, like many things
in ancient India,

17:46.558 --> 17:48.391
and-and around the world,

17:48.460 --> 17:51.961
uh, these temples may be much, much older

17:52.064 --> 17:55.165
than the mainstream
archeologists are saying.

17:59.571 --> 18:02.472
Could it be that hidden
beneath Kailasa Temple

18:02.574 --> 18:05.008
is an underground alien city?

18:07.012 --> 18:11.581
And if so, would this prove that
the being Hindus call Shiva

18:11.650 --> 18:14.417
was really an extraterrestrial visitor

18:14.486 --> 18:18.988
who gave technology to
an earlier race of humans

18:19.091 --> 18:22.525
and ultimately destroyed them?

18:22.627 --> 18:25.028
Perhaps further clues can be found

18:25.130 --> 18:27.664
by examining a sacred icon

18:27.766 --> 18:30.500
believed to hold extraordinary power.

18:35.474 --> 18:37.040
The Shiva Linga stone

18:37.142 --> 18:39.642
actually can be a force
for incredible destruction.

18:39.745 --> 18:42.846
We're dealing with
some kind of cosmic power

18:42.948 --> 18:44.514
that we didn't fully understand

18:44.583 --> 18:47.317
until the discovery of nuclear fission.

18:51.847 --> 18:54.081
NARRATOR Sirsi, India.

18:54.150 --> 18:56.750
Ten miles outside of this city,

18:56.852 --> 18:59.019
in the southwestern state of Karnataka,

18:59.121 --> 19:00.955
within the river Shalmala,

19:01.057 --> 19:05.159
is one of the country's
most popular pilgrimage sites,

19:05.228 --> 19:07.328
Sahasralinga.

19:09.332 --> 19:12.099
Hidden under these waters
for most of the year

19:12.201 --> 19:16.203
lie stone sculptures
known as Shiva Lingams.

19:16.305 --> 19:19.506
These sacred idols are representations

19:19.609 --> 19:22.009
of the god Shiva,

19:22.078 --> 19:25.279
and are visible to thousands
of pilgrims once a year

19:25.348 --> 19:28.682
at the festival of Maha Shivaratri.

19:28.784 --> 19:31.018
Maha Shivaratri is a festival

19:31.120 --> 19:36.190
where Shiva is worshipped
for his great nature.

19:36.259 --> 19:40.628
Maha Shivaratri is usually
held in the end of February

19:40.730 --> 19:41.929
or beginning of March.

19:41.998 --> 19:43.564
During that month,

19:43.633 --> 19:47.868
the water level of the
Shalmala River drops down

19:47.970 --> 19:52.740
so that all the Shiva Lingas are exposed.

19:52.808 --> 19:55.676
Shiva's depicted as the Shiva Linga,

19:55.778 --> 19:58.078
as kind of a spherical column,

19:58.180 --> 20:02.616
the flaming pillar that is
the cosmic axis of the universe.

20:04.987 --> 20:08.722
Every Shiva Linga that's in
worship is set into a yoni.

20:08.824 --> 20:11.058
This is a-a special base,

20:11.160 --> 20:14.895
and it actually serves
kind of a utility of function.

20:14.997 --> 20:16.864
It's a spout so that
when you pour offerings

20:16.966 --> 20:21.769
over the surface of the linga,
they wash over the sacred body.

20:21.837 --> 20:26.607
Images of the Shiva Linga are
found throughout Southeast Asia,

20:26.709 --> 20:29.009
even in parts of East Asia.

20:29.111 --> 20:32.046
Sometimes images of Shiva as the lingam

20:32.114 --> 20:36.817
also made its way into
China and into Japan.

20:40.823 --> 20:45.025
The Shiva Lingam first
appeared over 2,000 years ago,

20:45.127 --> 20:48.295
and there is still debate
over what this shape

20:48.397 --> 20:51.565
was originally meant to symbolize.

20:51.667 --> 20:54.635
But ancient astronaut theorists suggest

20:54.737 --> 20:56.737
that the icon may represent

20:56.839 --> 21:00.474
an incredibly powerful
technological device.

21:04.046 --> 21:05.279
Paris, France.

21:05.381 --> 21:07.014
1900.

21:07.116 --> 21:10.884
At the Paris Congress
of History of Religions,

21:10.953 --> 21:14.021
Swami Vivekananda, a scientist and monk

21:14.123 --> 21:17.791
credited with popularizing
Hinduism in the West,

21:17.860 --> 21:22.863
gives a lecture addressing
the meaning of the Shiva Lingam.

21:22.965 --> 21:25.733
For centuries,
Western scholars have assumed

21:25.835 --> 21:29.103
that the Shiva Linga has purely
a sexual connotation.

21:29.205 --> 21:31.171
The cylinder is the male phallic symbol

21:31.273 --> 21:34.074
and the yoni is the
complimentary female symbol.

21:34.143 --> 21:37.478
Then in 1900, the Hindu
scholar Swami Vivekananda

21:37.580 --> 21:40.147
came to Paris to deliver a major lecture

21:40.216 --> 21:42.116
about Hinduism and symbolism.

21:42.218 --> 21:44.718
During this lecture,
he said that the Shiva Linga

21:44.787 --> 21:48.589
actually symbolizes
the coming in or going out

21:48.691 --> 21:52.826
of the divine manifesting energy of Shiva.

21:52.928 --> 21:55.329
It stands for energy.

21:55.431 --> 21:58.332
And it has often been
misrepresented in the West

21:58.434 --> 22:01.769
that it is simply a
phallic symbol of Shiva,

22:01.871 --> 22:03.036
which is not the case.

22:03.105 --> 22:04.872
It is obviously a pillar.

22:04.974 --> 22:08.275
"Linga" means a pillar.

22:08.344 --> 22:10.277
Modern Hindu scholars have theorized

22:10.346 --> 22:12.413
that the Shiva Linga stone

22:12.515 --> 22:14.782
actually represents atomic energy.

22:16.886 --> 22:20.454
When we think about this idea
of what atomic energy can do,

22:20.523 --> 22:22.322
how it can be used for good but it can be

22:22.425 --> 22:23.991
extraordinarily destructive,

22:24.059 --> 22:26.360
this certainly pertains
to the mythology of Shiva,

22:26.429 --> 22:30.697
who is chaotic energy, who is
a force for incredible good,

22:30.800 --> 22:33.434
but also a force for
incredible destruction.

22:37.072 --> 22:40.374
Is it possible that
this symbol of Shiva's power

22:40.443 --> 22:43.911
actually represents atomic energy?

22:43.979 --> 22:47.114
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes,

22:47.183 --> 22:49.450
and suggest the proof can be found

22:49.552 --> 22:53.187
by examining this mysterious shape.

22:53.255 --> 22:56.356
The cylindrical structure
of the Shiva Linga

22:56.459 --> 23:01.728
is similar or almost identical
to a modern-day nuclear reactor.

23:03.966 --> 23:06.200
And the groove that surrounds the base

23:06.268 --> 23:07.801
represents the structures

23:07.903 --> 23:10.904
built to dispose of the polluted water.

23:12.808 --> 23:15.442
In ancient times and even today,

23:15.544 --> 23:18.745
Hindus pour water or milk
on top of Shiva Linga

23:18.814 --> 23:21.215
as a ritual.

23:21.283 --> 23:27.087
Today we pour water over the top
of nuclear reactor to cool it.

23:29.425 --> 23:33.260
And interestingly, most Shiva temples

23:33.362 --> 23:36.129
are always found near water bodies,

23:36.198 --> 23:41.401
like rivers or lakes,
just like nuclear power plants.

23:41.470 --> 23:44.905
So is it possible that Shiva Linga

23:44.974 --> 23:49.209
actually represents
an ancient nuclear power plant?

23:53.916 --> 23:56.149
In the story of Shiva
and the Shiva Linga,

23:56.218 --> 23:58.819
we're obviously dealing with
some kind of a universal

23:58.921 --> 24:02.256
or cosmic power that we
didn't fully understand

24:02.358 --> 24:03.991
until the 20th century,

24:04.093 --> 24:07.895
with the discovery of nuclear
power and nuclear fission.

24:07.997 --> 24:11.865
These discoveries that predate modern man

24:11.934 --> 24:15.502
are completely changing our
conception of the ancient past

24:15.571 --> 24:19.339
and connecting us to the
true history of humanity,

24:19.408 --> 24:21.842
all before the time of the flood.

24:24.480 --> 24:26.480
Does the Shiva Lingam symbolize

24:26.582 --> 24:28.916
an extraterrestrial technology

24:29.018 --> 24:33.520
that existed on Earth
before the Great Flood?

24:33.589 --> 24:35.889
Could it be a message left for us

24:35.958 --> 24:39.826
by our ancestors that
an advanced society of humans

24:39.929 --> 24:44.898
existed long ago and
suffered a terrible fate?

24:44.967 --> 24:47.901
Perhaps further clues can be found

24:47.970 --> 24:51.104
by examining a 4,000-year-old text

24:51.206 --> 24:54.875
that describes how to harness electricity.

24:57.880 --> 25:01.348
Sage Agastya is said to have brought

25:01.417 --> 25:03.584
secret science to India.

25:03.686 --> 25:06.453
Sage Agastya was directly trained

25:06.522 --> 25:09.056
by extraterrestrials himself.

25:16.982 --> 25:18.982
Ujjain, India.

25:19.084 --> 25:21.485
1924.

25:21.587 --> 25:24.922
Lost pages from an ancient Sanskrit text

25:25.024 --> 25:27.057
called the Agastya Samhita

25:27.159 --> 25:30.160
are discovered in the
city's royal library.

25:31.931 --> 25:35.399
While the exact age of
this text is not known,

25:35.501 --> 25:38.735
some Hindu scholars believe
it could date back

25:38.837 --> 25:41.638
more than 4,000 years.

25:41.740 --> 25:45.976
In it are the collected
works of Sage Agastya,

25:46.078 --> 25:50.214
a disciple of Shiva and the
first in a line of Hindu saints

25:50.316 --> 25:51.982
known as siddhas.

25:52.084 --> 25:55.152
"Siddha" means a perfected one,

25:55.254 --> 25:56.486
or an accomplished one.

25:56.589 --> 25:58.989
These are people who have powers

25:59.091 --> 26:03.393
like shrinking to a small size,
growing very large,

26:03.495 --> 26:05.295
flying through the air.

26:05.397 --> 26:11.201
Shiva is generally regarded
as being the ultimate siddha,

26:11.303 --> 26:13.971
the first and primordial siddha.

26:17.009 --> 26:19.109
According to Hindu texts,

26:19.211 --> 26:23.747
the ancient siddhas wielded
highly advanced technology.

26:23.849 --> 26:26.183
The siddhas are masters of creation.

26:26.285 --> 26:29.152
The Siddha Bhogar has been credited

26:29.255 --> 26:31.388
with many wondrous technologies

26:31.490 --> 26:34.091
that he is thought to have created

26:34.193 --> 26:37.561
long before the advent
of modern industry.

26:37.663 --> 26:41.331
He is credited with building a steamship,

26:41.433 --> 26:43.100
a telescope,

26:43.202 --> 26:44.468
a parachute,

26:44.570 --> 26:46.403
a locomotive,

26:46.505 --> 26:50.741
and also various devices
to fly through the sky.

26:50.843 --> 26:55.212
Sage Agastya is very important
for siddha tradition as well.

26:55.314 --> 27:00.484
He is said to have brought
the secret culture

27:00.586 --> 27:03.287
and secret science to India.

27:03.389 --> 27:05.355
When you read the legends

27:05.457 --> 27:07.658
about how Sage Agastya
got his knowledge,

27:07.760 --> 27:10.260
we hear that he was directly trained

27:10.362 --> 27:12.696
by extraterrestrials himself.

27:16.735 --> 27:19.136
Dr. Varam R. Kokatnur,

27:19.238 --> 27:22.606
a chemist and avid researcher
of hieroglyphics,

27:22.708 --> 27:26.243
studied the lost pages
of the Agastya Samhita

27:26.345 --> 27:29.012
that were discovered in 1924.

27:29.114 --> 27:32.783
What he found fascinated
him to such an extent

27:32.885 --> 27:37.487
that, in 1927, he read
the translated pages

27:37.589 --> 27:42.059
before the American Chemical
Society in Detroit, Michigan.

27:42.161 --> 27:44.428
The chemists were astonished,

27:44.530 --> 27:48.198
and reached the same conclusion
as Dr. Kokatnur had:

27:48.300 --> 27:52.536
that this ancient manuscript
provides accurate instructions

27:52.638 --> 27:56.540
for how to make a dry electric battery.

27:56.642 --> 27:59.109
The battery doesn't show up

27:59.211 --> 28:02.112
in our conventional technology
until the 19th century.

28:02.214 --> 28:05.115
What the heck is it doing
in the Agastya Samhita--

28:05.217 --> 28:07.851
the sacred text that was
Agastya's personal writings?

28:07.953 --> 28:11.221
If Agastya knew how to build a battery,

28:11.323 --> 28:15.826
then how can we rule out all of
the other marvelous technology

28:15.928 --> 28:18.662
that is described in the same document?

28:22.067 --> 28:25.602
On March 31, 2016,

28:25.704 --> 28:28.238
author and researcher David Childress

28:28.340 --> 28:31.875
met with physics professor
Dr. Michael Dennin

28:31.977 --> 28:33.844
at the University of California, Irvine,

28:33.946 --> 28:37.547
to put Sage Agastya's
centuries-old instructions

28:37.649 --> 28:40.717
for building a battery to the test.

28:40.819 --> 28:42.986
So we need a well-cleaned copper plate.

28:43.088 --> 28:44.521
Okay, so that's the copper plate here.

28:44.623 --> 28:45.756
That's gonna make one end of our battery.

28:45.858 --> 28:47.190
All right.

28:47.292 --> 28:49.760
And we need an earthenware vessel.

28:49.862 --> 28:51.061
We've actually chosen to substitute that

28:51.163 --> 28:53.163
with a plastic petri dish.

28:53.265 --> 28:56.199
All that vessel is is an
insulator to hold our battery.

28:56.301 --> 28:58.168
These are transparent,
so we can look inside

28:58.270 --> 28:59.436
while we do our test.

28:59.538 --> 29:01.405
And then we need copper sulfate.

29:01.507 --> 29:03.573
So I've got some copper sulfate
solution here.

29:03.675 --> 29:04.808
It's a liquid and it's blue.

29:04.910 --> 29:06.276
That tells you about the copper inside.

29:06.378 --> 29:09.012
Okay, and we need moist sawdust.

29:09.114 --> 29:10.747
We're gonna actually
start with dry sawdust,

29:10.849 --> 29:13.216
and when we add the copper
sulfate in our battery,

29:13.318 --> 29:14.484
it'll become our moist sawdust.

29:14.586 --> 29:16.420
Okay, and then we need a zinc plate.

29:16.522 --> 29:18.488
So finally the silver-looking plates,

29:18.590 --> 29:19.723
those are our zinc plates.

29:19.825 --> 29:22.559
That makes the other end of the battery.

29:22.661 --> 29:24.394
All right, let's see
how this works, then.

29:24.496 --> 29:25.796
Okay, so we start with the copper plate.

29:25.898 --> 29:28.698
As I said, you put that at the bottom.

29:28.801 --> 29:30.467
And then we add the sawdust.

29:30.569 --> 29:32.569
Okay, and what does the sawdust do?

29:32.671 --> 29:34.204
Well, one of the important
things in the battery

29:34.306 --> 29:36.740
is to make sure the two metals
don't touch each other.

29:36.842 --> 29:39.176
They have to stay separated
or the battery is shorted out.

29:39.278 --> 29:42.112
Now we're gonna add zinc on top.

29:42.214 --> 29:44.548
Now we're gonna add the copper sulfate.

29:44.650 --> 29:45.782
What does that do?

29:45.884 --> 29:47.317
So this is our electrolyte solution.

29:47.419 --> 29:49.286
It's a key element to the battery.

29:49.388 --> 29:52.422
It's gonna cause the chemical
reaction that'll take electrons

29:52.524 --> 29:56.159
from one of the metals and allow
them to flow to the other metal,

29:56.261 --> 30:00.430
and that'll give us
our current and our battery.

30:00.532 --> 30:02.499
Now we're gonna take our volt
meter and we're gonna check

30:02.601 --> 30:03.667
and see what sort of voltage

30:03.769 --> 30:05.535
we're getting out of this battery.

30:07.439 --> 30:10.140
And as you can see, we've got
one volt on the volt meter.

30:10.242 --> 30:12.442
So our battery is actually
working and running.

30:12.544 --> 30:15.912
Wow, and this really validates
this ancient text.

30:16.014 --> 30:18.648
So what can you do with one volt?

30:18.750 --> 30:20.884
Well, with one volt

30:20.986 --> 30:23.186
and a typical single battery like this,

30:23.288 --> 30:25.789
the cool thing is you have
enough energy content

30:25.891 --> 30:28.758
that you could lift a person,
say a 200-pound person,

30:28.861 --> 30:31.862
about ten meters into the air,
if you had the right machinery

30:31.964 --> 30:33.630
to hook this battery up to.

30:33.732 --> 30:35.599
Wow.

30:37.769 --> 30:39.569
A battery with enough power

30:39.671 --> 30:41.471
to lift a person off the ground?

30:41.573 --> 30:45.542
Could the technology described
by Sage Agastya

30:45.644 --> 30:48.111
be connected to the floating thrones

30:48.213 --> 30:50.614
that were allegedly
witnessed in the chamber

30:50.716 --> 30:52.916
beneath Kailasa Temple?

30:53.018 --> 30:56.853
Is this further evidence
of an advanced society

30:56.955 --> 30:59.589
that arose thousands of years ago,

30:59.691 --> 31:02.659
during a time when extraterrestrials

31:02.761 --> 31:04.661
coexisted with mankind?

31:04.763 --> 31:08.999
But if so, what happened to Shiva

31:09.101 --> 31:12.068
and the devices he brought to Earth?

31:12.170 --> 31:15.338
Ancient astronaut theorists suggest

31:15.440 --> 31:19.809
the answers may lie hidden high
on a Himalayan mountain peak

31:19.912 --> 31:22.612
that is forbidden to climbers.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.418
Almost every pilgrim who goes

31:28.520 --> 31:31.454
to Mount Kailash reports
unusual experiences.

31:31.557 --> 31:35.091
Is it possible that
Mount Kailash is some kind of

31:35.193 --> 31:38.128
extraterrestrial base
inside of a mountain?

31:45.830 --> 31:48.497
NARRATOR The Tibetan Himalayas.

31:48.599 --> 31:52.701
In this harsh desolate region of the world

31:52.803 --> 31:56.372
stands a mountain sacred
to billions of people,

31:56.440 --> 31:59.942
the distinctive peak of Mount Kailash.

32:00.010 --> 32:03.979
Mount Kailash in Western
Tibet is a remarkable peak.

32:04.081 --> 32:07.850
It rises some 22,000 feet
pretty much straight up.

32:07.918 --> 32:10.619
It's seen somewhat conical from one side,

32:10.721 --> 32:13.922
more like a pyramid from another.

32:14.024 --> 32:17.760
It is the origins of four
of the world's great religions:

32:17.828 --> 32:21.897
Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Daoism.

32:21.999 --> 32:24.867
Mount Kailash is believed to be

32:24.935 --> 32:27.169
home of Shiva.

32:27.271 --> 32:31.039
He's supposed to reside
on top of Mount Kailash.

32:31.108 --> 32:34.109
Because of that, it is sacred.

32:37.581 --> 32:39.948
Dr. Ernst Muldashev,

32:40.017 --> 32:44.753
a prominent Russian eye surgeon,
has led 21 expeditions

32:44.855 --> 32:48.757
examining some of the most
remote regions on the planet.

32:48.859 --> 32:53.996
In 1999, he spent a month at Mount Kailash

32:54.098 --> 32:56.031
studying its structure.

32:56.133 --> 33:01.670
What he found led him to put
forth a controversial theory,

33:01.772 --> 33:05.607
one that suggests
Mount Kailash may be much more

33:05.676 --> 33:09.678
than just the mythological home of Shiva.

33:09.780 --> 33:13.282
Dr. Ernst Muldashev led an expedition

33:13.384 --> 33:15.884
of Russian scientists to Mount Kailash.

33:15.953 --> 33:19.955
And he observed that its apex,
its peak, highly resembles

33:20.057 --> 33:23.325
a man-made pyramid and
began to develop the theory

33:23.394 --> 33:27.463
that, in fact, the apex
of Kailash is man-made

33:27.565 --> 33:29.898
or perhaps made by extraterrestrials

33:29.967 --> 33:32.668
as the home of Shiva.

33:35.673 --> 33:38.640
This is a huge pyramid,

33:38.742 --> 33:41.877
the largest pyramid in the world.

33:41.979 --> 33:45.681
It is, in fact, very similar
to a step pyramid.

33:51.689 --> 33:53.589
Could Mount Kailash really

33:53.691 --> 33:57.059
contain an artificial structure
that is home to Shiva?

33:58.896 --> 34:02.030
According to all religions
that revere the mountain,

34:02.132 --> 34:05.234
setting foot on its slopes is a dire sin,

34:05.336 --> 34:10.072
and it is claimed that many
who ventured to defy the taboo

34:10.174 --> 34:12.440
died in the process.

34:12.543 --> 34:16.545
This, along with the fact
that China prohibits

34:16.614 --> 34:18.246
climbing Mount Kailash,

34:18.349 --> 34:21.617
has made examination
of the peak impossible.

34:21.719 --> 34:24.719
But curiously,
many who visit the mountain

34:24.822 --> 34:28.590
have reported strange happenings.

34:28.692 --> 34:31.493
Almost every pilgrim
who goes to Mount Kailash

34:31.594 --> 34:34.696
reports unusual experiences along the way.

34:34.797 --> 34:38.800
A lot of people report rapid
aging if they stay in the area.

34:38.902 --> 34:43.071
Fingernails grow faster,
hair grows faster.

34:45.543 --> 34:47.175
Pilgrims go to Kailash

34:47.277 --> 34:49.911
to absorb the energy of the mountain.

34:50.014 --> 34:53.047
What I personally felt near Mount Kailash?

34:56.554 --> 34:58.520
I felt some energy.

34:58.622 --> 35:00.656
I usually do not feel energy.

35:00.724 --> 35:04.726
I do not have psychic powers,
but I felt it.

35:09.567 --> 35:11.567
Is it possible that there really is

35:11.635 --> 35:16.338
some sort of energy
emanating from Mount Kailash?

35:16.440 --> 35:19.641
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes

35:19.743 --> 35:23.345
and suggest that, considering
the strange anomalies

35:23.447 --> 35:27.115
and the legends that warn
against ascending the peak,

35:27.217 --> 35:30.552
Mount Kailash may be radioactive.

35:31.989 --> 35:35.223
As further evidence,
they point to a drawing

35:35.292 --> 35:38.293
that was discovered in the
Mogao Caves of Western China,

35:38.395 --> 35:43.599
approximately 600 miles north
of Mount Kailash.

35:43.667 --> 35:46.735
Between 500 BC and 1500 AD,

35:46.837 --> 35:51.773
Buddhists stashed away
over 50,000 manuscripts

35:51.842 --> 35:53.942
in the Mogao Cave system.

35:54.044 --> 35:56.645
These went undiscovered
until Aurel Stein,

35:56.747 --> 36:01.116
a Hungarian-born British
researcher, came there in 1907

36:01.218 --> 36:03.719
and rediscovered the cave.

36:03.821 --> 36:07.789
Hidden among these manuscripts
was an incredible diagram.

36:07.858 --> 36:10.359
It's from a second-century manuscript,

36:10.461 --> 36:13.195
and it's of Mount Meru,
the cosmic access,

36:13.297 --> 36:17.599
or stairway to heaven, of the
Buddhist and Hindu tradition.

36:17.668 --> 36:20.268
Mount Meru is readily identified

36:20.371 --> 36:23.672
as a representation of Mount Kailash.

36:23.774 --> 36:25.741
The thing about this diagram

36:25.843 --> 36:29.011
is that it appears to be
highly technological.

36:30.748 --> 36:32.714
Ancient astronaut theorists

36:32.783 --> 36:36.585
suggest that this diagram
appears incredibly similar

36:36.687 --> 36:39.354
to a modern-day particle accelerator,

36:39.423 --> 36:43.659
the type used to power a nuclear reactor.

36:45.062 --> 36:47.929
And some propose that just before the time

36:48.032 --> 36:50.932
of the Great Flood,
the remote mountain peak

36:51.035 --> 36:55.270
provided the perfect location
for extraterrestrials to dispose

36:55.372 --> 36:57.039
of their nuclear technology,

36:57.141 --> 37:00.575
much like Yucca Mountain in Nevada is used

37:00.678 --> 37:03.912
to store nuclear waste today.

37:03.981 --> 37:07.749
Is it possible that Mount Kailash in Tibet

37:07.851 --> 37:11.586
is some kind of hollowed-out mountain,

37:11.689 --> 37:14.256
hollowed out thousands of years ago,

37:14.358 --> 37:16.425
perhaps by extraterrestrials,

37:16.527 --> 37:20.362
and could be completely
poisoned by radiation?

37:23.534 --> 37:25.634
Could Mount Kailash contain

37:25.703 --> 37:27.135
the ultimate physical evidence

37:27.237 --> 37:31.440
of an earlier advanced
civilization here on Earth?

37:31.542 --> 37:34.609
One that had nuclear capabilities,

37:34.712 --> 37:37.379
which were given to them
by extraterrestrials

37:37.448 --> 37:40.749
represented in the form
of the Hindu gods?

37:40.818 --> 37:43.085
Ancient astronaut theorists

37:43.187 --> 37:45.954
suggest that the truth about our past

37:46.056 --> 37:50.692
may be uncovered by taking
a closer examination of Shiva

37:50.794 --> 37:53.729
and what he truly represents.

37:59.378 --> 38:03.647
August 5, 1927.

38:03.749 --> 38:06.216
Russian philosopher

38:06.318 --> 38:09.386
and Nobel Peace Prize
nominee Nicholas Roerich

38:09.488 --> 38:12.422
is exploring the
Himalayan Mountains when he sees

38:12.524 --> 38:15.692
a giant oval moving at a high speed

38:15.794 --> 38:19.229
and glowing like the sun.

38:19.331 --> 38:22.265
Changing directions
from south to southwest,

38:22.367 --> 38:25.402
it disappears into the sky.

38:28.006 --> 38:32.742
Many of these UFO sightings are
reported by Hindu pilgrims...

38:34.813 --> 38:38.715
who move towards Mount Kailash.

38:38.817 --> 38:43.019
They've also reported
UFOs around Mount Kailash

38:43.121 --> 38:47.891
sometimes appearing to go
directly into the mountain.

38:47.993 --> 38:52.896
And some people even claim there
is an underground UFO base,

38:52.998 --> 38:57.400
as there have been reports
of UFOs coming from the sky

38:57.502 --> 39:00.503
and disappearing at ground level.

39:02.974 --> 39:06.976
If Mount Kailash was once radioactive,

39:07.079 --> 39:10.013
as some ancient astronaut
theorists suggest,

39:10.115 --> 39:14.017
could the presence of UFOs
in the area be a sign

39:14.119 --> 39:17.687
that it is once again safe to access?

39:17.789 --> 39:21.124
Or could it still contain
working technology

39:21.226 --> 39:25.362
that extraterrestrials continue
to utilize to this day?

39:25.464 --> 39:29.999
Some ancient astronaut theorists
propose the answer may be found

39:30.102 --> 39:32.969
by taking another look at Shiva,

39:33.071 --> 39:37.240
and the possibility that he is
not just the bringer of energy,

39:37.342 --> 39:39.876
but is energy itself.

39:41.947 --> 39:45.081
When J. Robert Oppenheimer,
the father of the atomic bomb,

39:45.183 --> 39:47.317
observed the first atomic explosion

39:47.419 --> 39:48.585
at the Trinity test site,

39:48.687 --> 39:51.955
he cited a line from the Bhagavad Gita.

39:52.057 --> 39:55.325
"I have become death,
destroyer of worlds."

39:55.427 --> 39:59.396
That's the title of Shiva.

39:59.498 --> 40:02.432
Perhaps we should listen
and look at these stories

40:02.534 --> 40:04.300
from a new perspective.

40:04.403 --> 40:07.370
What is the description about?

40:07.472 --> 40:11.908
Could it be that Shiva
was some type of energy?

40:15.414 --> 40:17.046
Is it possible that Shiva

40:17.149 --> 40:20.917
is a representation of some
incredible cataclysmic event

40:21.019 --> 40:24.454
that happened thousands of years ago?

40:24.556 --> 40:29.559
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes, but also insist

40:29.661 --> 40:33.129
that another demonstration
of Shiva's destructive powers

40:33.231 --> 40:36.266
is not only possible but inevitable.

40:38.203 --> 40:40.537
We are approaching

40:40.639 --> 40:43.473
the beginning of a new future for mankind.

40:43.575 --> 40:46.075
So, in a sense, it's the end of an era

40:46.178 --> 40:48.745
and the turning of a new page.

40:48.847 --> 40:51.481
Even though Shiva's function is to destroy,

40:51.583 --> 40:53.183
and he's given that title,

40:53.285 --> 40:56.252
god of destruction, at the same time

40:56.354 --> 40:58.421
he makes it possible to create.

40:58.523 --> 41:01.391
So, destruction is part of creation.

41:01.493 --> 41:03.960
The extraterrestrials will come back,

41:04.062 --> 41:08.431
and it will be the most amazing
chapter in human history.

41:12.904 --> 41:15.405
Is Shiva really nothing more

41:15.507 --> 41:18.274
than a mythical Hindu god?

41:18.376 --> 41:21.511
One that offered early humans
a way of describing

41:21.613 --> 41:24.380
some incredible catastrophic event?

41:24.483 --> 41:28.151
Or is he something more?

41:28.253 --> 41:32.322
Something of extraterrestrial origin?

41:32.424 --> 41:34.824
Perhaps the answer lies not in the images

41:34.926 --> 41:37.694
carved upon the walls of a temple

41:37.796 --> 41:41.464
or in the words found
written in sacred texts,

41:41.566 --> 41:45.268
but in the awesome power of energy

41:45.370 --> 41:49.105
and mankind's increasing
ability to harness it,

41:49.207 --> 41:53.409
as we make our journey
back to the stars.
