WEBVTT

00:02.253 --> 00:03.242
(EXHALES)

00:07.258 --> 00:08.873
HOUSE: How long has
your daughter had
trouble breathing?

00:09.886 --> 00:11.217
About a week now.

00:12.597 --> 00:14.178
The best dads
wait two or more.

00:15.308 --> 00:17.299
Yeah, no.
It's not like it's serious.

00:17.393 --> 00:20.476
I checked online
and it's asthma
or something.

00:20.563 --> 00:22.474
"Or something" is
the number one killer

00:22.607 --> 00:24.563
of teens with
no medical degree.

00:24.692 --> 00:26.432
When was the last time
he took you to see a doctor?

00:26.527 --> 00:28.233
Uh...
Like five months ago.

00:28.321 --> 00:30.778
We went to
a clinic in Trenton.
I had strep throat.

00:30.865 --> 00:33.777
Remember the antibiotic
they gave you?
Is it neomycin?

00:33.868 --> 00:35.324
Amoxicillin.

00:38.497 --> 00:41.580
80, about the inhaler
for my asthma, l was...

00:41.667 --> 00:42.702
Sorry.

00:43.252 --> 00:45.413
Hospital policy
specifically prohibits me

00:45.504 --> 00:47.711
from giving meds
to unrelated homeless people

00:47.798 --> 00:48.924
pretending to be
father and daughter.

00:50.593 --> 00:52.049
Your pants are
a size too short,

00:52.136 --> 00:53.376
so either you grew
several of inches

00:53.471 --> 00:55.632
or you grabbed the closest
size in the thrift store.

00:55.723 --> 00:58.214
And only you have dimples,
which are adorable,

00:58.309 --> 01:00.425
but they're also an X-linked
dominant genetic trait.

01:02.355 --> 01:03.561
Which actually
doesn't prove anything.

01:03.689 --> 01:05.725
The fact that she
didn't burst into
tears tells me

01:05.816 --> 01:07.681
that you never thought
he was your dad.

01:08.611 --> 01:09.646
Let's get out of here.

01:11.405 --> 01:14.192
Since you're the brains
of the operation, you might
want to stick around.

01:14.283 --> 01:16.069
What, so I can get
busted by Social Services?

01:16.160 --> 01:19.277
No. So you can stop
bleeding out of your ear.

01:21.374 --> 01:23.831
It's usually a sign
of a skull fracture.

01:24.043 --> 01:27.535
Someone been using your head
as a soccer ball?

01:27.630 --> 01:29.871
No.
As much as I'd like to
take your word for it,

01:30.299 --> 01:32.130
l have no interest in
taking your word for it.

01:33.135 --> 01:35.171
No tenderness. No pain.

01:36.055 --> 01:38.637
Right. Looks like
you're telling the truth
about something.

01:43.729 --> 01:45.390
The ear canal is fine.

01:47.149 --> 01:49.310
And you don't have a fever.

01:50.236 --> 01:52.818
Pay the man. He's late
for a trashcan fire.

02:05.293 --> 02:07.375
Would you tell me
what's going on?
What's wrong with me?

02:08.587 --> 02:10.168
l have no idea.

02:47.626 --> 02:50.333
Why did you ask
to meet us 30 miles away
from the hospital?

02:54.383 --> 02:55.418
Because I can.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.884
Also, Chris Christie's
blog says

02:59.013 --> 03:01.254
the pancakes
here are the best.

03:01.349 --> 03:03.761
So, what do we got
on this 18-year-old

03:03.851 --> 03:05.466
with the ear bleed
and the breathing problems?

03:05.603 --> 03:09.471
CT confirms no skull fracture.
And looking at her
confirms she's not 18.

03:09.815 --> 03:12.227
Yes, she is.
Says so in the file.

03:12.318 --> 03:14.775
We can't treat
an underage patient
without a guardian.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.022
We need to call
Social Services.

03:16.614 --> 03:17.945
I cut a deal
with the patient.

03:18.324 --> 03:19.860
We don't call,
she doesn't bolt.

03:19.950 --> 03:23.078
Whatever age, living
on the street makes her
vulnerable to malnutrition,

03:23.162 --> 03:24.242
drug use, HIV...

03:24.330 --> 03:25.536
All things which could
explain her symptoms.

03:25.623 --> 03:30.037
No sign of malnutrition,
tox screen's clear,
STD panel was negative

03:30.127 --> 03:32.209
and is that Foreman?

03:35.299 --> 03:36.880
Oh, my goodness, it is.

03:37.468 --> 03:38.799
Hi, Dean Foreman!

03:41.722 --> 03:42.711
(CAMERA CLICKS)

03:51.357 --> 03:54.690
Are you not gonna introduce us
because we're married?

03:54.777 --> 03:55.812
No, wait, that's her.

03:56.362 --> 03:58.899
She's a pharmaceutical rep,
and this is
a working breakfast.

03:58.989 --> 04:01.480
In a restaurant that's
nowhere near your
home or the hospital?

04:02.535 --> 04:05.072
Chris Christie
recommends the pancakes.

04:08.249 --> 04:11.116
Squamous cell middle ear
tumor could've caused
the ear bleed,

04:11.210 --> 04:12.996
paraneoplastic reaction caused
the breathing problems.

04:13.087 --> 04:14.452
Middle ear looks
completely normal.

04:14.547 --> 04:17.129
But there is thickening
in the lining of the wall
of the third ventricle.

04:17.216 --> 04:18.706
Could be a sign of
cerebral infection.

04:18.801 --> 04:20.166
JESSICA: It would explain
the lack of fever.

04:20.261 --> 04:22.877
Pneumococcus is pretty common
among the homeless population.

04:22.972 --> 04:24.508
We should find out if
she's been vaccinated.

04:24.598 --> 04:27.715
Sure. Ask her and when
she refuses to
tell you anything,

04:27.810 --> 04:30.392
start her on ceftriaxone
for pneumococcus.

04:31.522 --> 04:33.683
And if she says she
has been vaccinated?

04:33.774 --> 04:36.390
Then don't believe her and
start her on ceftriaxone
for pneumococcus.

04:36.485 --> 04:39.727
How about we don't
believe she's gonna bolt
and we call Social Services.

04:39.822 --> 04:41.107
While I'm in
the little boys' room,

04:41.198 --> 04:43.530
you can pretend I'm seriously
considering that idea.

04:45.661 --> 04:46.741
The bathroom's that way.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.786
Pretty sure there's
one in the hospital.

04:56.547 --> 04:59.163
When I was your age,
I ran away.

04:59.258 --> 05:00.293
Lived on my own.

05:01.844 --> 05:02.833
At the time, it seemed...

05:02.970 --> 05:03.959
Let me guess,

05:04.054 --> 05:08.297
life with mom and
dad was kind of a drag
so you just ran away,

05:08.392 --> 05:10.599
lived with friends
and partied with guys

05:10.728 --> 05:12.969
that you knew your
parents would hate,

05:13.063 --> 05:15.805
and then when you got
tired of being a rebel,
you just went home.

05:17.401 --> 05:21.394
Being homeless isn't
a vacation for me,

05:21.489 --> 05:23.275
and I'm not acting out.

05:24.283 --> 05:26.990
My life at home sucked,
so I got the hell
out of there.

05:27.077 --> 05:29.864
There are other
options besides living
on the streets.

05:29.955 --> 05:32.537
Right. Like group homes,
where you're packed in

05:32.625 --> 05:35.492
with as many messed-up,
delinquent kids as possible,

05:35.586 --> 05:37.827
foster parents, who only
take you in because
you're a meal ticket.

05:37.922 --> 05:40.709
I can think of easier ways
to make 175 bucks a week.

05:40.799 --> 05:42.255
No, you're right.
I really should roll the dice

05:42.343 --> 05:45.506
and hope for a pair
that don't ruin my life
the way that my mom...

05:45.596 --> 05:47.086
Get your hands off my stuff!

05:47.181 --> 05:49.263
This stuff might tell us more
about why you're sick.

05:49.350 --> 05:50.965
A history textbook?
You go to school?

05:51.060 --> 05:53.847
I don't plan on being
homeless forever.

05:58.817 --> 06:00.353
Hello, good sir.

06:00.444 --> 06:04.437
My brother the general
here gots the green
apple quick step.

06:10.079 --> 06:12.070
One of us is in
the wrong time zone.

06:12.164 --> 06:14.246
And if it's me, I need
to talk to a stockbroker

06:14.333 --> 06:17.917
and anyone from
the Kennedy family.
In that order.

06:18.003 --> 06:19.618
He got the runs
and we do need him

06:19.797 --> 06:21.412
up and at 'em for
battle tomorrow.

06:21.507 --> 06:24.920
It's hardly authentic,
coming to a newfangled clinic,

06:25.010 --> 06:26.750
especially with
a Yankee doctor.

06:28.889 --> 06:31.972
Sir, are you questioning
my resolve?

06:32.059 --> 06:33.765
Yes. And your sanity.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.847
I'm multi-tasking.

06:35.938 --> 06:38.475
General, do not light out.

06:38.691 --> 06:41.979
We swore that we would
see the elephant together.

06:45.864 --> 06:50.153
Far be it from me to come
between two nut jobs and
their elephant.

06:56.458 --> 06:59.245
I could add some mercury
if you want to make
it more authentic.

07:00.296 --> 07:02.708
The Confederacy
thanks you, Doc.

07:10.431 --> 07:11.420
(DOOR CLOSES)

07:14.310 --> 07:18.098
I got House's phone,
deleted all photos
of you and Anita.

07:18.897 --> 07:19.932
I owe you.

07:20.024 --> 07:22.686
An affair?
Never knew you
were such a tramp.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.061
Neither did I.

07:24.153 --> 07:27.645
Anita, she's fun, smart,

07:27.740 --> 07:30.732
not looking for
anything serious.
It's pretty perfect.

07:31.827 --> 07:34.409
Except for the gnawing guilt
about the husband,

07:34.496 --> 07:35.952
the lies she
must be telling him.

07:36.040 --> 07:38.372
But not guilty
enough to stop seeing her.

07:38.459 --> 07:41.542
She's smoking hot.
And it's not his job
to protect her marriage.

07:42.504 --> 07:43.960
Aren't you supposed
to be pointing a finger

07:44.089 --> 07:45.590
at your own life as
a cautionary tale?

07:45.674 --> 07:48.586
If not for cheating,
I might still have a wife

07:48.677 --> 07:51.259
but I wouldn't have
Sophie and Sophia.

07:51.347 --> 07:55.465
Which means I wouldn't
be preparing for
their visit this week

07:55.559 --> 07:59.472
by child-locking
all my cabinets,
padding table corners

07:59.563 --> 08:03.681
and getting rid of
every single magazine.

08:03.776 --> 08:06.768
You could probablyjust
hide the porn in
your underwear drawer.

08:06.862 --> 08:10.320
The magazines
go away so I won't
ignore my children.

08:11.241 --> 08:12.947
I know I have to
pay attention to them,

08:13.077 --> 08:14.817
I want to pay
attention to them.

08:14.912 --> 08:18.404
But they're just so

08:18.499 --> 08:19.659
bonng.

08:21.669 --> 08:23.079
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

08:26.298 --> 08:28.960
Did you learn anything
at Jane Doe's school?

08:29.093 --> 08:31.459
JESSICA: They did
a bunch of vaccinations,
including pneumococcus.

08:31.553 --> 08:33.339
Take her off the ceftriaxone.

08:33.430 --> 08:34.806
So we're back
to square none.

08:34.890 --> 08:35.925
Not exactly.

08:36.016 --> 08:37.972
The name she registered
under seems to be fake,

08:38.060 --> 08:39.891
but the address is
a foreclosed house.

08:40.145 --> 08:42.557
We'll let you
know what we find.

08:44.108 --> 08:46.064
Plenty of food, water.

08:46.276 --> 08:47.311
And beer.

08:47.403 --> 08:50.110
She eats well, goes to school,
makes good grades.

08:50.406 --> 08:52.692
She's a homeless girl
who's captain of
the volleyball team.

08:52.783 --> 08:54.444
How can you be
okay with this?

08:54.535 --> 08:56.947
Your mom sends you
to work with snacks.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.698
I want and need parents.

08:59.164 --> 09:00.995
Jane Doe is flourishing
without them.

09:01.083 --> 09:02.289
Maybe.

09:04.253 --> 09:06.539
But this mold definitely is.

09:08.257 --> 09:09.542
CALLIE: You went to my school?

09:09.967 --> 09:11.252
Now that they know
they'll report me.

09:11.343 --> 09:13.459
I can't go back there.

09:13.554 --> 09:16.512
You may have
a fungal infection,
you need that medicine.

09:16.598 --> 09:19.681
Fluconazole, right?
I'll get it at a clinic.

09:21.145 --> 09:22.134
(GROANS)

09:23.021 --> 09:24.852
I can't feel my legs!

09:24.940 --> 09:26.305
Is that the infection?

09:26.608 --> 09:28.314
I don't think so.

09:31.280 --> 09:34.522
So, what causes an ear bleed,

09:34.616 --> 09:36.231
breathing problems

09:36.326 --> 09:39.284
and our runaway's
inability to run away?

09:40.414 --> 09:41.745
CHASE: Fungal infection's
off the table.

09:41.874 --> 09:43.205
What about
transverse myelitis?

09:43.292 --> 09:45.408
Not with normal
posterior column function.

09:46.128 --> 09:48.494
I've been waiting to do
this for months. Pull!

09:54.720 --> 09:57.052
Sights seem
to be off on this.

09:57.723 --> 09:59.304
We didn't call
Social Services before

09:59.391 --> 10:01.177
because we didn't want
the patient to take off.

10:01.268 --> 10:04.010
Now she can't.
There's no reason
for us not to call.

10:04.104 --> 10:07.813
How about the reason
that there's no reason.
This is working fine for me.

10:08.192 --> 10:09.227
Pull!

10:12.738 --> 10:15.195
That one clearly
took evasive action.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.863
You want to protect her,
because you think

10:17.034 --> 10:18.649
she's fine on her own,
outside the system...

10:18.744 --> 10:21.702
Does anyone have a position
on our patient's
medical condition?

10:21.789 --> 10:24.246
Could be endocarditis
with septic emboli.

10:24.333 --> 10:25.368
Pull!

10:29.213 --> 10:31.499
I'd turn around and shoot you,
but apparently I'd miss.

10:31.673 --> 10:33.459
There's no murmurs,
no Osler nodes.

10:33.550 --> 10:36.508
You've never done
this before, have you?

10:36.595 --> 10:37.630
No, I have not.

10:37.763 --> 10:40.800
But all the time I had
my ankle monitor on, l was
furious that I couldn't.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.598
Vasculitis fits.

10:45.854 --> 10:46.969
Start treatment with steroids.

10:47.481 --> 10:49.893
If she's lucky, she'll be
free to flee again.

10:50.025 --> 10:52.767
Not once I call
Social Services.

10:52.861 --> 10:54.397
I'm not giving up.

10:55.614 --> 10:57.150
You wanna bet?

10:57.825 --> 10:59.235
One shot, one birdie.

10:59.409 --> 11:02.116
You hit, you make
the call. You miss,
never mention it again.

11:02.579 --> 11:04.661
No. Why would I agree?

11:04.748 --> 11:08.536
Because your
only other option is
you call and I fire you.

11:26.603 --> 11:27.763
JESSICA: Pull!

11:42.953 --> 11:43.988
TAUB: She responding
to corticosteroids?

11:44.121 --> 11:45.236
Looks like it.

11:45.539 --> 11:47.370
And Social Services.

11:48.292 --> 11:50.954
I thought for sure
there'd be some
yelling or profanity,

11:51.086 --> 11:52.121
possible bloodletting.

11:52.296 --> 11:55.038
JESSICA: She's tired of living
on the streets after all.

11:55.132 --> 11:57.874
I'll bet House regrets...

12:01.096 --> 12:03.883
Could he know I'm
good with a gun?

12:03.974 --> 12:06.306
I don't know how, but...

12:08.478 --> 12:11.311
Hiring a hooker
to pretend to be
a social worker?

12:11.440 --> 12:13.977
She took a bet that
she knew she'd win.

12:14.151 --> 12:16.062
Frankly, I feel violated.

12:16.153 --> 12:18.314
What happened
to the social worker
lcaHed?

12:18.447 --> 12:21.439
Apparently someone
identifying themselves
as Dr. Pujols called

12:21.575 --> 12:23.816
and said the
patient ran off.
(LAUGHING)

12:25.162 --> 12:27.949
Come on, Poo-holes.

12:28.999 --> 12:30.910
I've informed Social
Services of the mistake

12:31.001 --> 12:32.582
and given Jane Doe's
description to the cops.

12:32.669 --> 12:33.749
They'll track
down the parents.

12:33.837 --> 12:35.077
Thank you.

12:35.172 --> 12:38.505
I'll leave you
and Dr. Pujols alone.

12:38.634 --> 12:41.091
You should have told me
you were treating
an underage clinic patient.

12:41.470 --> 12:43.256
I was giving you
the gift of deniability.

12:43.347 --> 12:45.303
Now I'm giving you the gift
of additional clinic hours.

12:46.308 --> 12:47.468
No, you're not.

12:47.768 --> 12:49.599
You've got nothing on me.

12:49.686 --> 12:51.426
Check your phone.

12:54.858 --> 12:56.598
My phone?

12:56.693 --> 13:00.026
Right, I guess
I did have some
pictures on that.

13:01.031 --> 13:04.194
But I also have these.

13:05.661 --> 13:08.949
Here's the two of you
kissing over dinner.

13:09.039 --> 13:10.700
Busting a move at a nightclub.

13:10.874 --> 13:13.365
Is that your hand
near her nether regions?

13:15.504 --> 13:18.792
Thanks again for
taking out the ankle bracelet.

13:18.882 --> 13:20.383
I'm not gonna let you
blackmail me, House.

13:20.509 --> 13:22.795
Of course not. There's
no way your selling
out your integrity

13:22.886 --> 13:25.298
would let me
compromise yourjob
in any major way

13:25.389 --> 13:27.630
over some
tawdry bit of gossip.

13:28.517 --> 13:32.226
But what about
compromising it
in a minor way,

13:32.354 --> 13:35.721
reduced clinic hours,
unlimited Internet
porn budget.

13:35.816 --> 13:38.148
That makes much
more sense than

13:38.276 --> 13:40.653
the nuclear option of
ruining both our lives.

13:42.072 --> 13:44.814
You can keep these.
I got copies.

13:53.750 --> 13:58.414
God, how I've missed
the sweet smell of
sticking it to the man.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.587
Adams is right.
You're protecting this girl.

14:01.091 --> 14:02.080
(SNIFFING)

14:02.300 --> 14:03.676
Oh, no, lwas wrong.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.671
That's the stench
of moralizing.

14:05.762 --> 14:09.129
I'm protecting myself
from meddling bureaucrats
and parents.

14:09.266 --> 14:10.346
You admire this girl.

14:10.434 --> 14:13.722
She had a horrible home life
so she went out on her own.

14:13.812 --> 14:15.052
She's your road not taken.

14:15.147 --> 14:17.980
I've always dreamed
of living in an abandoned
house with mold.

14:18.108 --> 14:21.350
House, all I'm accusing
you of is having a connection
with a patient.

14:21.445 --> 14:22.480
This is a good thing.

14:22.654 --> 14:24.645
It's not a good thing,
'cause it's not a thing.

14:24.781 --> 14:28.148
It is a thing,
which you'll prove
when her parents show up,

14:28.285 --> 14:30.446
and you start
protecting her from them.

14:36.626 --> 14:41.165
The sound I make is "moo."

14:42.257 --> 14:46.125
And the sound I
make is "quack."

14:55.270 --> 14:56.259
(BOTH COOING)

15:10.494 --> 15:11.483
Moo!

15:18.668 --> 15:20.533
The sound is quack.

15:20.712 --> 15:22.327
Quack, quack.

15:23.673 --> 15:25.504
Quack, quack, quack.

15:29.221 --> 15:31.212
I'm an ass.

15:31.348 --> 15:34.932
On the plus side,
I can now program
my DVR from my phone.

15:35.018 --> 15:37.009
They are kind of boring.

15:37.145 --> 15:38.260
All kids. Notjust yours.

15:38.396 --> 15:39.556
Very helpful.

15:40.357 --> 15:41.597
You need to log more hours.

15:41.691 --> 15:44.103
Eventually
you'll pass boredom,
get to bonding.

15:44.194 --> 15:47.061
Like Stockholm syndrome.

15:47.197 --> 15:49.859
I heard the nurses talking.
You called Social
Services for real.

15:49.991 --> 15:51.652
Because you shouldn't
be living on your own.

15:51.743 --> 15:54.029
Right. Better my mom should
use me as a punching bag.

15:54.996 --> 15:57.487
If your mom abused you,
Social Services

15:57.582 --> 15:59.368
won't let you
go home with her.

15:59.543 --> 16:00.999
Have I mentioned I
don't trust the system?

16:01.086 --> 16:03.122
We don't know if
you're better yet.
You can't just take off.

16:05.799 --> 16:07.664
Uh...
Can we help you?

16:07.759 --> 16:09.875
I'm Adele Brown
from Social Services,
and this...

16:10.011 --> 16:13.048
I'm Ellen Rogers,
Callie's mother.

16:13.181 --> 16:14.717
You haven't been
that for two years.

16:15.934 --> 16:17.640
I promise,
things are different...

16:17.727 --> 16:20.389
Wow, two sentences in
and you're already
making promises.

16:20.522 --> 16:23.434
Okay. Maybe we need
to take a minute here
and give Callie some space.

16:23.567 --> 16:26.309
No, I don't need a minute.
I need her out of my life.
(COUGHING)

16:26.403 --> 16:28.394
Is she okay?
I will be once you just...

16:30.407 --> 16:31.522
Oh, my God!

16:32.450 --> 16:33.860
TAUB: We need help in here!

16:42.252 --> 16:43.367
Go!

16:44.212 --> 16:46.203
You bet 100 bucks
on a turtle race?

16:46.590 --> 16:49.081
I paid Mr. Chips 5
bucks to take a dive.

16:51.761 --> 16:53.092
The bleeding
stopped on its own.

16:53.221 --> 16:56.088
She got worse after
being on steroids,
so autoimmune is out.

16:56.224 --> 16:58.306
Diagnosis depends on
whether the blood
was coming from

16:58.393 --> 17:00.258
the sinuses,
lungs or her guts.

17:02.147 --> 17:04.103
Mr. Chips looks
like he wants it.

17:04.232 --> 17:06.939
100 bucks says
he'll make soup
out of Franklin.

17:08.653 --> 17:09.688
You're on.

17:10.864 --> 17:11.899
How'd the mom seem to you?

17:11.990 --> 17:15.073
If you're asking if she looks
like someone who beat her kid,
you're a moron.

17:15.368 --> 17:16.983
Move your ass, Mr. Chips!

17:18.121 --> 17:19.110
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

17:35.972 --> 17:38.008
You should have seen her face
when mom walked in.

17:38.141 --> 17:40.382
Callie hates her.
I don't think she's lying.

17:40.477 --> 17:42.468
Because people never lie
about people they hate.

17:42.646 --> 17:45.388
Big sinus bleed
could be sinusitis
and a bleeding disorder.

17:45.482 --> 17:46.722
She didn't
complain about a headache.

17:46.816 --> 17:49.523
If the bleeding is in her gut,
could be Zollinger-Ellison.

17:49.653 --> 17:53.896
Acid reflux causes asthma, and
the acid erodes the stomach,
causing the bleeding.

17:55.325 --> 17:56.656
Yes!

17:58.078 --> 18:01.070
Franklin rules.
Mr. Chips drools.

18:02.499 --> 18:05.115
HOUSE: Mr. Chips'
owner only feeds him
on apples and bananas.

18:05.210 --> 18:06.871
Nowhere near enough
Vitamin A. Pay up.

18:07.379 --> 18:10.587
Do an upper
endoscopy to confirm
Zollinger-Ellison.

18:10.674 --> 18:12.756
After mommy dearest has
given her permission.

18:12.842 --> 18:15.174
Ellen shouldn't have consent
if she beat her daughter.

18:15.387 --> 18:17.218
Doesn't matter if
she beat her daughter.

18:17.347 --> 18:20.009
Only matters if
Social Services says
she beat her daughter.

18:21.518 --> 18:24.180
Good thing you
made it all official.

18:26.898 --> 18:29.355
Will the endoscopy be painful?

18:29.442 --> 18:31.182
Is that an issue?

18:32.696 --> 18:35.529
It's a medical procedure,
there will be some discomfort.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.776
I never meant to
hurt my daughter.

18:39.202 --> 18:40.362
And yet, you hit her.

18:41.538 --> 18:42.573
She told you that?

18:43.373 --> 18:45.113
And now you're gonna
tell me you didn't.

18:47.419 --> 18:49.034
I'm a drug addict.

18:49.212 --> 18:51.373
And I've been a lousy mom.

18:54.217 --> 18:55.627
Especially since
my husband died.

18:55.969 --> 19:01.384
He was closer to
Callie than lwas,
and I missed him so much.

19:02.225 --> 19:04.591
And it was too hard,

19:04.728 --> 19:08.391
and taking oxyjust
made things easier.

19:09.399 --> 19:12.562
Right up until it
made me lose my daughter.

19:14.446 --> 19:16.402
I hurt Callie a lot.

19:17.657 --> 19:22.993
But one of the only things
that I can feel okay about
is that I never hit her.

19:33.256 --> 19:37.750
Didn't peg you as
the midday fun kind of guy.
So glad I was wrong.

19:40.430 --> 19:41.419
Mmm...

19:41.931 --> 19:44.843
Unfortunately,
that's not why we're here.

19:47.354 --> 19:50.687
Remember that guy from
the restaurant yesterday?

19:51.107 --> 19:52.096
Mmm-hmm.

19:53.943 --> 19:57.310
He's got pictures of us.
He's threatening to
show your husband.

19:57.447 --> 20:00.234
Ithoughtyou
said that guy was
one of your best doctors.

20:00.325 --> 20:01.781
Yeah. Not one
of my best people.

20:04.287 --> 20:06.778
We've got to stop
seeing each other.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.613
Not necessarily.

20:09.459 --> 20:10.949
I told my husband about you.

20:13.004 --> 20:15.040
What? Why?

20:15.799 --> 20:17.414
He was saying
that things had been

20:17.550 --> 20:19.131
better lately
between him and I,

20:19.219 --> 20:21.301
that l was happier.

20:21.388 --> 20:24.880
I said that I was,
and that you were the reason.

20:25.975 --> 20:28.512
And he was okay with that?

20:28.603 --> 20:31.766
Not initially.
It was a pretty
tough conversation.

20:31.856 --> 20:34.472
Neither of us is ready to
give up on the marriage,

20:34.567 --> 20:37.024
and I am not
ready to give up this.

20:41.116 --> 20:44.108
You don't have to feel
so guilty anymore.

20:54.087 --> 20:55.076
(GEORGE INHALING SHARPLY)

20:55.630 --> 20:56.665
(GEORGE GROANS)

20:57.382 --> 20:58.838
You didn't need
to shoot yourself.

20:59.217 --> 21:01.128
I could have
given you a Section 8.

21:03.138 --> 21:04.173
We've hit
the drills pretty hard,

21:04.264 --> 21:06.846
and by the fourth round,
my hand went numb.
The gun slipped.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.719
And I only had
blanks in it but...

21:08.810 --> 21:12.803
It's funny how nearly
shooting your toe off
cured that speech impediment.

21:12.897 --> 21:17.015
Ha! Yeah. Sorry about that.
Sheldon's a progressive.

21:18.153 --> 21:20.269
Compared to who?
Rupert Murdoch?

21:20.363 --> 21:23.651
Progressives are
reenactors who strive for
complete authenticity.

21:23.741 --> 21:26.528
They never drop character
while in uniform.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.655
Whereas you just
dabble in crazy?

21:29.497 --> 21:30.486
(SIGHS)

21:31.124 --> 21:33.490
Sheldon and I had a big
falling out years ago.

21:33.585 --> 21:37.419
We only really started
talking again because
of the reenactments.

21:37.505 --> 21:40.292
They gave me
my brother back.

21:40.884 --> 21:42.624
That's a very moving story.

21:42.719 --> 21:44.425
Be a lot more affecting
if you hadn't bonded

21:44.512 --> 21:46.844
over something so
completely idiotic.

21:47.557 --> 21:48.546
(GASPS)

21:53.146 --> 21:55.637
Your mom didn't
hit you, did she?

21:57.275 --> 21:58.606
No.

21:58.693 --> 22:01.025
Then why did you
lie about it?

22:03.239 --> 22:05.070
Because I wanted
to get out of here.

22:05.366 --> 22:09.154
People understand getting hit
more than what my mom does.

22:09.245 --> 22:11.622
Tell me,
maybe I'll understand.

22:15.543 --> 22:17.079
l was the mom.

22:18.880 --> 22:23.214
She couldn't keep a job,
spent all her money on pills.

22:23.301 --> 22:24.666
I had to get a job.

22:24.761 --> 22:28.925
Double shifts just
to keep the power on,
keep food in the house.

22:29.766 --> 22:31.927
I couldn't tell you
how many times
she nearly OD'd

22:32.060 --> 22:35.177
and I had to clean her
up and put her in bed.

22:37.649 --> 22:40.061
So I decided if I was
gonna be the grown-up,

22:40.193 --> 22:42.605
I'd rather do it
on my own terms.

22:50.703 --> 22:52.989
Your mom knows she messed up.

22:53.581 --> 22:55.287
She's determined
not to do it again.

22:55.375 --> 22:56.615
Yeah.

22:57.794 --> 22:58.829
And she'll feel that way

22:58.920 --> 23:01.036
right up until
things get too tough

23:01.172 --> 23:03.333
and she has to
start using again.

23:11.224 --> 23:13.590
Do you think
people can change?

23:13.977 --> 23:15.137
No.

23:15.687 --> 23:20.181
But I don't think that's
gonna change your opinion
because people don't change.

23:24.112 --> 23:25.147
Stop.

23:25.488 --> 23:27.399
Is that an ulcer?
Yeah, it is.

23:27.824 --> 23:29.064
But we haven't
reached the stomach yet,

23:29.158 --> 23:30.534
I'm still high
in the esophagus.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.491
Means it's not
Zollinger-Ellison.

23:33.955 --> 23:34.990
Ulcer's bleeding.

23:35.707 --> 23:38.073
We need to lavage
before she drowns
in her own blood.

23:38.710 --> 23:41.201
(COUGHING)

23:43.548 --> 23:45.209
We cauterized the ulcer,
stopped the bleeding.

23:45.300 --> 23:47.040
Compromised immune system
from living on the street

23:47.135 --> 23:48.545
could make her
susceptible to HPV.

23:48.636 --> 23:51.173
HPV was covered
on the STD panel,
she's negative.

23:51.264 --> 23:53.346
What if she didn't get this
from being homeless?

23:53.433 --> 23:54.548
What if she got
it from her mom?

23:54.642 --> 23:56.883
I'm assuming you're thinking
something genetic because...

23:56.978 --> 23:58.263
I'm thinking addiction.

23:58.688 --> 24:00.269
Alcohol-induced
esophagitis.

24:00.356 --> 24:02.688
Explains esophageal ulcers
and her other symptoms.

24:03.443 --> 24:04.979
If only it would
explain why we've never

24:05.069 --> 24:06.980
seen her drunk,
drinking or detoxing.

24:07.280 --> 24:09.612
Her blood pressure's
been elevated.
Could be the DTs.

24:09.699 --> 24:11.064
It's been mildly elevated.

24:11.159 --> 24:15.118
Mildly elevated BP
could put her at risk
for a berry aneurysm.

24:15.204 --> 24:19.072
Weak blood vessel in
the brain gets pounded on
by elevated BP,

24:19.167 --> 24:21.624
causes it to
expand and contract,

24:21.878 --> 24:23.914
causes the symptoms
to come and go.

24:24.005 --> 24:26.166
CT didn't show any
signs of an aneurysm.

24:26.257 --> 24:27.713
Did I mention come and go?

24:27.800 --> 24:29.631
As much as your
presence may cause

24:29.761 --> 24:31.626
objects to become
engorged with blood,

24:31.721 --> 24:33.677
sometimes aneurysms
just aren't in the mood.

24:33.765 --> 24:36.302
Alcoholism and berry aneurysm
are both valid theories.

24:36.392 --> 24:38.303
I think we should discuss this
with the patient and her mom.

24:38.394 --> 24:39.930
Why? We've discussed
it right here.

24:40.021 --> 24:43.263
Tell them she needs
a cerebral angiogram
to locate the aneurysm,

24:43.358 --> 24:45.144
surgery to repair.

24:47.820 --> 24:50.197
Brain surgery? When?

24:50.281 --> 24:53.239
We've booked the OR
for an hour from now.

24:53.326 --> 24:56.363
And Dr. House is sure
that's what she has?

24:56.454 --> 24:57.739
He's confident
in the diagnosis.

24:57.830 --> 24:59.695
It's consistent with
all of her symptoms.

25:02.085 --> 25:03.165
But you don't buy it.

25:05.046 --> 25:06.081
No.

25:07.507 --> 25:09.668
I think your symptoms are
the result of alcohol abuse.

25:11.678 --> 25:13.259
But I'm not an alcoholic.

25:13.346 --> 25:15.302
You came to the hospital
with beer in your pocket,

25:15.473 --> 25:16.758
we found more
alcohol at your house...

25:16.849 --> 25:18.555
Yeah, I use booze
as payment.

25:18.643 --> 25:20.429
I have an occasional
beer with my friends.

25:20.520 --> 25:22.556
That doesn't mean
I have a problem.

25:26.317 --> 25:27.602
I want the surgery.

25:28.695 --> 25:31.277
Actually,
it's your mom's decision.

25:35.702 --> 25:36.691
(SIGHS)

25:37.620 --> 25:38.780
I'm not an addict.

25:38.871 --> 25:41.704
That's what I always
said to you, Callie,
but I had a problem.

25:41.791 --> 25:43.702
I'm nothing like you.

25:47.463 --> 25:49.715
Tell them to do the surgery.

25:54.929 --> 25:57.295
I need a few minutes to think.

26:03.479 --> 26:04.810
The patient asked
me what I thought.

26:04.897 --> 26:07.229
I pay you to think
inside this room.

26:07.316 --> 26:09.056
Outside this room,
I pay you to parrot.

26:09.152 --> 26:10.983
It's her choice.
She has the right to know.

26:11.070 --> 26:13.061
It's a medical choice
that you turned into

26:13.197 --> 26:15.233
an extension of
your baggage and hers.

26:15.324 --> 26:17.064
You told the mom
something you want
to believe

26:17.160 --> 26:18.195
because you don't
want to believe that

26:18.286 --> 26:20.402
this girl might be
doing fine parent-free.

26:20.496 --> 26:22.236
Which also happens
to be what the mom
wants to believe...

26:22.331 --> 26:24.583
You think she wants
to feel responsible
for her daughter's illness?

26:24.667 --> 26:26.658
That woman sees
everything to do
with her daughter

26:26.794 --> 26:29.661
through
guilt-colored glasses.

26:29.797 --> 26:31.583
It's all her fault.

26:37.805 --> 26:39.011
House,

26:40.933 --> 26:44.346
don't bully her,
she's overwhelmed enough.

26:45.104 --> 26:46.685
It's nothing compared
to how she's gonna feel

26:46.773 --> 26:49.856
when her daughter dies
from the aneurysm she
decided not to treat.

27:09.545 --> 27:11.376
You must be Dr. House.

27:12.465 --> 27:13.955
I save my appearances

27:14.050 --> 27:18.544
for when parents are
on the brink of doing
something incredibly stupid.

27:19.806 --> 27:23.890
Your daughter has
a berry aneurysm,
she needs surgery.

27:23.976 --> 27:27.719
What she does not need
is you making this or
any other decision.

27:28.815 --> 27:29.804
(SCOFFS)

27:29.899 --> 27:32.140
I can'tjust
leave this up to her.

27:32.235 --> 27:33.350
Then leave it up to me.

27:33.903 --> 27:35.234
And just leave.

27:37.573 --> 27:39.313
I'm not gonna
abandon my daughter.

27:40.827 --> 27:42.363
She hates you.

27:47.083 --> 27:48.573
It's actually not
such a big deal.

27:48.709 --> 27:50.165
Plenty of kids
hate their parents.

27:50.253 --> 27:53.745
What makes it
a big deal is that
she should hate you.

27:55.424 --> 27:59.508
Playing the biology card
doesn't change anything
except where she lives.

28:00.263 --> 28:02.675
Your daughter's
better off without you,

28:02.765 --> 28:05.882
so let her be
better off without you.

28:11.440 --> 28:13.180
I'm gonna do the surgery.

28:13.276 --> 28:15.858
I'll take the fallout
from Social Services.

28:35.673 --> 28:37.083
ELLEN: Dr. House.

28:45.308 --> 28:47.674
My daughter's
care is my choice.

28:48.644 --> 28:50.180
And so is this.

28:51.105 --> 28:53.141
Treat her for alcoholism.

28:58.654 --> 28:59.734
Peek-a-boo!

28:59.822 --> 29:03.360
Why would Anita
tell her husband
about our affair?

29:03.492 --> 29:05.232
Probably just
got sick of lying.

29:05.328 --> 29:09.367
Look at it this way, now
the sex is both commitment
and guilt-free.

29:09.498 --> 29:12.490
And men love
commitment-free sex.

29:13.169 --> 29:16.206
Yes, they do.
Oh, yes, they do.

29:18.299 --> 29:21.257
They're gonna
find out eventually.

29:22.970 --> 29:24.130
Peek-a-boo.

29:24.221 --> 29:25.882
How do you keep
doing the same thing
over and over

29:26.015 --> 29:27.380
with the same
level of enthusiasm?

29:27.850 --> 29:30.136
First off, be a decent,
empathetic person.

29:31.354 --> 29:32.389
This is what you
said you wanted,

29:32.521 --> 29:34.261
but you're actually more upset
now that the husband knows.

29:34.523 --> 29:36.479
Because I'm hurting him.
You always were.

29:36.567 --> 29:39.650
But he didn't know that.
Which means he
wasn't really hurt.

29:40.488 --> 29:41.978
Yeah, I know it's
a rationalization,

29:42.073 --> 29:45.941
but it went a long way
to making me feel a little
less guilty about seeing her.

29:46.035 --> 29:48.526
Looks like you're gonna need
a bigger rationalization.

29:49.538 --> 29:51.870
Peek-a-boo. Peek-a-boo.

29:54.335 --> 29:56.451
Social Services
report came in on your mom.

29:56.545 --> 29:59.673
Let me guess,
she passed with
flying colors.

30:00.675 --> 30:01.915
She always does.

30:02.426 --> 30:03.415
(SIGHS)

30:03.928 --> 30:06.544
I think she might
make it this time.

30:07.556 --> 30:10.343
House left a bottle
of Vicodin to see
if she'd steal it.

30:10.601 --> 30:12.341
She gave it back.

30:16.607 --> 30:18.222
You could at least let
her sleep in the room.

30:18.943 --> 30:22.106
She could have listened
to me about my drinking.

30:22.238 --> 30:25.446
Even if you are right
about it, why take
your word over mine?

30:25.574 --> 30:27.781
I'm her daughter.

30:27.910 --> 30:31.619
Because she's your mom.

30:31.747 --> 30:34.409
And for the first time
she's acting like it.

30:38.921 --> 30:40.036
It's a little late for that.

30:43.592 --> 30:45.048
Good night.

31:02.194 --> 31:03.229
Morning.

31:03.320 --> 31:05.151
I heard you went
head-to-head with the mom.

31:05.281 --> 31:06.521
Not for your reasons.

31:06.615 --> 31:07.650
You're protecting the girl.

31:07.783 --> 31:09.068
I'm protecting my diagnosis.

31:09.160 --> 31:11.572
And you tested her,
to see if you could
get her back on drugs

31:11.662 --> 31:12.697
and out of her
daughter's life.

31:12.788 --> 31:16.201
That was to show Adams
that mommy dearest
hadn't changed.

31:16.292 --> 31:19.659
I'm taking a principled
stand against idealism.

31:19.795 --> 31:22.286
Your patient's stable?

31:22.381 --> 31:26.044
Maybe Adams was right.
The illness is
alcohol related.

31:26.135 --> 31:29.002
I hope so considering
that's what we're
treating her for.

31:29.138 --> 31:32.972
You hope you're
wrong for the sake
of the patient.

31:34.518 --> 31:38.807
I hope that I'm right,
but the aneurysm bursts
without killing her.

31:39.648 --> 31:41.354
Call me a softie.

31:43.152 --> 31:46.485
Or the mom
agrees to an autopsy
so I can prove it.

31:52.369 --> 31:54.985
Your patients love you
because you're empathetic.

31:57.041 --> 31:59.953
I also have kind eyes.
Why are you here?

32:00.044 --> 32:02.160
But you don't love
all of your patients.

32:04.173 --> 32:05.663
Of course not.

32:05.758 --> 32:07.874
I'll bet some
of them bore you.

32:08.010 --> 32:10.626
Dull people get cancer too.
Why are you here?

32:10.721 --> 32:14.305
But you fake an interest
in them because
you need to, right?

32:14.391 --> 32:17.053
And if you do it
long enough,
it becomes real?

32:17.186 --> 32:21.270

the interest isn't fake.

32:21.941 --> 32:23.647

32:23.734 --> 32:26.271
Because you realize
they're not dull,

32:26.403 --> 32:28.940
it was just your
misinterpretation of them.

32:29.031 --> 32:31.397
I just haven't found
a way to make them
interesting yet.

you both like or hate.

Sometimes the best way
to connect with someone

32:45.256 --> 32:47.872
is stop thinking about them
and focus on yourself.

maybe you could tell
your husband that we did.

to sneaking around
behind his back?

slipped on her way
into a soup kitchen.

39:06.512 --> 39:09.424
But once they hatched,
the worms got to
work on her lungs,

39:09.515 --> 39:11.301
her ear, and the nerves
in her legs.

39:11.391 --> 39:13.723
The worms got agitated
by the steroids we gave her,

39:13.810 --> 39:16.347
which started
them on their journey
to the esophagus.

39:16.438 --> 39:18.770
And, ultimately, to the heart.

39:19.858 --> 39:23.396
A few pills of mebendazole,
and she'll be fine.

39:32.829 --> 39:35.115
She's feeling much better,
walking on her own.

39:35.207 --> 39:36.413
Getting along with
her mother?

39:36.500 --> 39:39.287
As long as I keep
bringing her muffins.

39:40.379 --> 39:43.086
Did someone come
take her for a test?

40:17.666 --> 40:19.873
Callie agrees with you.

40:19.960 --> 40:22.201
That people don't change.

40:22.296 --> 40:25.208
She said when her
mom slips again,
she didn't want to be there.

40:25.299 --> 40:27.540
She'd rather remember
her like she is now.

40:29.428 --> 40:30.838
Smaﬂgm.

40:32.931 --> 40:34.091
You got the ending you wanted.

40:34.182 --> 40:37.345
Because I was only looking
to solve the case,
not their lives.

40:38.979 --> 40:41.561
I don't care if
the people who work
for me are screwed up,

40:41.898 --> 40:43.729
in fact I even encourage it,

40:43.817 --> 40:47.560
but absolution,
do that on your own time.

40:50.574 --> 40:52.155
Or not at all.

40:52.242 --> 40:54.654
'Cause clearly you suck at it.

41:02.961 --> 41:03.950
(BOTH COOING)

41:31.948 --> 41:34.200
This is Aaron Rodgers.

41:34.284 --> 41:37.947
Wow, 127 quarterback rating.

41:38.038 --> 41:40.495
Do you know what
sound he makes?

41:40.582 --> 41:42.413
(GROWLING)

41:43.377 --> 41:44.662
(COOING)

41:47.923 --> 41:49.413
Okay. Oy!

41:49.925 --> 41:50.914
Um...

41:53.303 --> 41:56.215
This is Terrell Owens.

41:56.306 --> 41:58.467
People call him To.

41:58.558 --> 41:59.718
Do you know what
sound he makes?

42:00.268 --> 42:01.257
(IMITATING BABY CRYING)

42:08.985 --> 42:10.771
This is Mark Sanchez.

42:10.862 --> 42:12.898
Do you know what sound
people make about him?

42:13.156 --> 42:14.145
(BLOWS RASPBERRY)

42:20.622 --> 42:22.123
Working late?

42:23.500 --> 42:24.990
Husband have her tonight?

42:26.837 --> 42:28.498
And every night.

42:29.381 --> 42:31.087
She broke it off.

42:31.800 --> 42:33.665
It's for the best.

42:33.760 --> 42:36.172
I'm not really
an affair guy after all.

42:36.263 --> 42:38.094
Sure you are, buddy.

42:39.015 --> 42:41.301
You just lost interest
once it stopped
being an affair.

42:41.393 --> 42:43.224
That's why you're relieved.

42:43.311 --> 42:45.802
But don't worry,
it's not gonna end here.

42:45.897 --> 42:48.809
You'll just have to get
your adrenaline fix
somewhere else.

42:48.900 --> 42:50.640
When that
doesn't do it anymore,

42:50.819 --> 42:52.605
you'll just
escalate things somehow.

42:54.406 --> 42:56.863
At least that's
what I've been told.

42:59.619 --> 43:01.200
I'm not like you, House.

43:03.415 --> 43:05.246
True. No limp.
