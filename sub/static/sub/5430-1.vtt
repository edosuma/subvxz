01:54.280 --> 01:55.697
Hey!

02:02.288 --> 02:04.206
I'll be right with you.

02:15.385 --> 02:19.304
So, Cameron. Here you go.

02:19.514 --> 02:23.058
Nine schools in 10 years.
My, my. Army brat?

02:23.309 --> 02:25.727
- Yeah. My dad is...
- That's enough.

02:27.188 --> 02:30.315
I'm sure you won't find Padua
any different than your old schools.

02:30.900 --> 02:34.069
Same little ass-wipe shit-for-brains
everywhere.

02:35.822 --> 02:41.076
Excuse me? Did you just say...
Am I in the right office?

02:41.202 --> 02:43.912
Not any more, you're not. I've got
deviants to see and a novel to finish.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.914
Now, scoot. Scoot!

02:46.416 --> 02:47.708
Okay.

02:48.877 --> 02:50.836
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

02:54.924 --> 02:56.425
Patrick Verona.

02:56.509 --> 02:59.094
I see we're making
our visits a weekly ritual.

02:59.179 --> 03:02.764
Only so we can have these moments
together. Should I hit the lights?

03:02.891 --> 03:05.434
Oh, very clever, kangaroo boy.

03:05.518 --> 03:08.020
Says here you exposed yourself
in the cafeteria?

03:08.730 --> 03:11.607
I was joking with the lunch lady.
It was a bratwurst.

03:11.691 --> 03:12.941
Bratwurst?

03:14.360 --> 03:16.236
Aren't we the optimist?

03:19.282 --> 03:21.950
Next time, keep it in your pouch, okay?

03:22.785 --> 03:24.119
Scoot!

03:37.967 --> 03:40.636
Hello! Michael Eckman.
I'm supposed to show you around.

03:40.762 --> 03:42.888
Oh, hi. Thank God. You know...

03:42.972 --> 03:45.807
Normally they send down
one of those audio visual geeks.

03:45.892 --> 03:47.643
No, I do. I know what you mean.

03:47.727 --> 03:49.311
Hey, Michael,
where should I put those slides?

03:49.395 --> 03:53.482
Michael? So... Cameron.

03:53.942 --> 03:57.819
Here's the breakdown. Over there,
we've got your basic beautiful people.

03:57.946 --> 04:01.323
Now listen. Unless they talk
to you first, don't bother.

04:01.407 --> 04:04.409
- Wait. Is that your rule or theirs?
- Watch. Hey, there.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.495
- Eat me.
- You see that?

04:08.164 --> 04:10.499
To the left, we have the coffee kids.

04:10.625 --> 04:13.085
- That was Costa Rican, butthead!
- Very edgy.

04:13.169 --> 04:15.087
Don't make any sudden movements
around them.

04:15.171 --> 04:17.673
These delusionals
are your white Rastas.

04:17.798 --> 04:20.341
They're big Marley fans.
They think they're black.

04:20.468 --> 04:22.344
- Semi-political, but mostly...
- Smoke a lot of weed?

04:22.470 --> 04:25.597
- Yeah. These guys...
- Wait, wait. Let me guess. Cowboys?

04:25.682 --> 04:29.309
Yeah, but the closest they've come
to a cow is McDonald's.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.854
McDonald's.

04:32.939 --> 04:35.857
These are your future MBAs.
We're all Ivy League accepted.

04:35.984 --> 04:37.859
Yuppie greed is back, my friend.

04:37.944 --> 04:40.862
- Hey, guys, how you doin'?
- Close it, Bogey!

04:42.031 --> 04:44.950
- Yesterday, I was their god.
- What happened?

04:46.202 --> 04:48.870
Bogey Lowenstein
started a rumour that I...

04:48.955 --> 04:52.040
That I buy my Izods at an outlet mall.

04:52.292 --> 04:55.043
- So they kicked you out?
- Hostile takeover. But don't worry.

04:55.211 --> 04:58.171
- He'll pay. Now, over here...
- Oh, my God.

05:06.389 --> 05:09.558
- What group is she in?
- The "don't even think about it" group.

05:09.684 --> 05:11.143
That's Bianca Stratford.
She's a sophomore.

05:11.227 --> 05:13.562
I burn, I pine, I perish.

05:13.813 --> 05:17.232
Of course you do.
You know, she's beautiful and deep.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.692
I'm sure.

05:19.235 --> 05:21.903
Yeah, but see, there's a difference
between like and love.

05:22.030 --> 05:25.574
Because I like my Skechers,
but I love my Prada backpack.

05:25.908 --> 05:28.076
But I love my Skechers.

05:28.202 --> 05:30.329
That's because you don't have
a Prada backpack.

05:33.082 --> 05:35.917
Listen, forget her.
Incredibly uptight father.

05:36.002 --> 05:37.085
And it's a widely known fact that

05:37.170 --> 05:39.921
the Stratford sisters
aren't allowed to date.

05:40.423 --> 05:41.590
Yeah.

05:42.425 --> 05:43.675
Whatever.

05:50.850 --> 05:54.519
Okay, then. What did everyone
think of The Sun Also Rises?

05:55.104 --> 05:58.273
I loved it. He's so romantic.

05:58.399 --> 06:00.525
Romantic? Hemingway?

06:00.610 --> 06:03.528
He was an abusive, alcoholic
misogynist who squandered half his life

06:03.613 --> 06:06.114
hanging around Picasso
trying to nail his leftovers.

06:06.199 --> 06:09.785
As opposed to a bitter,
self-righteous hag who has no friends?

06:12.121 --> 06:13.789
Pipe down, Chachi.

06:15.083 --> 06:17.209
I guess in this society,
being male and an asshole

06:17.293 --> 06:19.127
makes you worthy of our time.

06:20.463 --> 06:21.797
What about Sylvia Plath,

06:21.881 --> 06:24.633
or Charlotte BrontÃ«
or Simone de Beauvoir?

06:25.927 --> 06:27.969
What'd I miss?

06:28.096 --> 06:31.306
The oppressive patriarchal values
that dictate our education.

06:31.391 --> 06:32.474
Good.

06:33.726 --> 06:35.394
- Hey, hey!
- Mr Morgan.

06:35.478 --> 06:37.729
Is there any chance we could get Kat
to take her Midol

06:37.814 --> 06:39.773
before she comes to class?

06:41.401 --> 06:42.818
Someday you're gonna get
bitch-slapped,

06:42.902 --> 06:45.612
and I'm not gonna do a thing to stop it.

06:46.155 --> 06:48.990
And, Kat, I want to thank you
for your point of view.

06:49.075 --> 06:51.576
I know how difficult it must be for you
to overcome all those years

06:51.661 --> 06:54.413
of upper-middle class
suburban oppression.

06:54.497 --> 06:55.997
Must be tough.

06:56.499 --> 07:00.168
But the next time you storm the P.T.A.,
crusading for better lunch meat,

07:00.253 --> 07:02.170
or whatever it is
you white girls complain about,

07:02.296 --> 07:05.006
ask them why they can't buy a book
written by a black man!

07:05.133 --> 07:08.718
- That's right, mon!
- Don't even get me started on you two.

07:11.347 --> 07:12.472
Anything else?

07:12.557 --> 07:15.142
Yeah, go to the office.
You're pissing me off.

07:15.226 --> 07:17.394
- What? Mr Morgan...
- Later!

07:23.568 --> 07:25.861
Undulating with desire,

07:26.863 --> 07:29.698
Adrienne removes her red...

07:41.085 --> 07:42.544
Crimson cape

07:43.337 --> 07:45.922
at the sight of Reginald's stiff and...

07:51.220 --> 07:52.554
Judith!

07:54.390 --> 07:57.184
What's another word for "engorged"?

07:58.102 --> 07:59.603
I'll look it up.

07:59.729 --> 08:00.854
Okay.

08:02.398 --> 08:06.568
- Swollen. Turgid.
- Tumescent?

08:07.570 --> 08:08.862
Perfect.

08:09.614 --> 08:13.408
So, I hear you were terrorising
Mr Morgan's class again.

08:15.536 --> 08:18.288
Expressing my opinion
is not a terrorist action.

08:18.414 --> 08:21.374
The way you expressed your opinion
to Bobby Ridgeway?

08:21.459 --> 08:24.503
By the way, his testicle
retrieval operation went quite well,

08:24.587 --> 08:26.338
in case you're interested.

08:26.422 --> 08:29.716
I still maintain
that he kicked himself in the balls.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.635
The point is, Kat...

08:34.222 --> 08:35.304
Cat.

08:41.270 --> 08:43.647
People perceive you as somewhat...

08:43.773 --> 08:44.898
Tempestuous?

08:44.982 --> 08:47.943
"Heinous bitch" is
the term used most often.

08:50.404 --> 08:52.739
You might want to work on that.

08:54.283 --> 08:55.784
Thank you.

08:56.244 --> 08:59.412
As always, thank you
for your excellent guidance.

08:59.997 --> 09:02.624
I'll let you get back
to Reginald's quivering member.

09:04.627 --> 09:07.629
"Quivering member." I like that.

09:08.839 --> 09:10.966
Virgin alert. Your favourite.

09:18.015 --> 09:19.391
Lookin' good, ladies.

09:19.475 --> 09:22.143
Oh, she's out of reach, even for you.

09:22.311 --> 09:25.981
- No one's out of reach for me.
- You wanna put money on that?

09:26.315 --> 09:28.024
Money, I've got.

09:28.484 --> 09:30.443
This I'm gonna do for fun.

09:33.823 --> 09:35.949
- Who's that guy?
- That's Joey Donner.

09:36.033 --> 09:38.618
He's a jerk off, and a model.

09:38.828 --> 09:40.245
- He's a model?
- A model.

09:40.329 --> 09:43.582
Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumoured
to have a big tube sock ad coming out.

09:43.666 --> 09:45.333
- Really?
- Really.

09:50.339 --> 09:53.800
Man, look at her. Is she always so...

09:53.884 --> 09:56.261
- Vapid?
- How can you say that? She's totally...

09:56.345 --> 09:58.138
- Conceited.
- What are you talking about?

09:58.222 --> 10:00.015
There's more to her than you think.

10:00.141 --> 10:04.436
Look at the way she smiles,
and look at her eyes, man.

10:04.520 --> 10:08.857
She's totally pure.
You're missing what's there.

10:09.025 --> 10:11.526
No, no, Cameron, no. What's there

10:11.652 --> 10:15.947
is a snotty little princess wearing
a strategically planned sun dress

10:16.032 --> 10:19.451
to make guys like us realise
that we can never touch her

10:19.535 --> 10:22.370
and guys like Joey realise
that they want to.

10:22.538 --> 10:26.082
She, my friend, is what we will spend
the rest of our lives not having.

10:26.208 --> 10:28.168
Put her in your spank bank, move on.

10:28.252 --> 10:31.087
- Move on.
- No, no. You're wrong about her.

10:31.213 --> 10:33.506
I mean, you know,
not about the spanking part,

10:33.591 --> 10:34.966
but the rest, you're wrong.

10:35.051 --> 10:38.595
All right... I'm wrong?
You wanna take a shot, be my guest.

10:38.721 --> 10:40.513
She's actually looking
for a French tutor.

10:40.598 --> 10:42.682
Are you serious? That's perfect!

10:42.767 --> 10:44.768
Do you speak French?

10:45.019 --> 10:47.062
Well, no, but I will.

10:50.232 --> 10:53.860
Hey. Your little Rambo look is out, Kat.

10:54.195 --> 10:57.864
- Didn't you read last month's Cosmo?
- Run along.

11:00.910 --> 11:04.412
I know you can be overwhelmed,
and you can be underwhelmed,

11:04.538 --> 11:06.706
but can you ever just be "whelmed"?

11:06.791 --> 11:10.335
- I think you can in Europe.
- Hi, ladies.

11:10.419 --> 11:13.213
Would you sweet young things
like a ride?

11:18.761 --> 11:20.804
Careful on the leather.

11:24.767 --> 11:27.227
That's a charming new development.

11:27.311 --> 11:28.937
It's disgusting.

11:32.149 --> 11:35.151
Remove head from sphincter,
then drive!

11:40.950 --> 11:42.575
- You okay?
- Yeah.

11:42.660 --> 11:45.286
Just a minor encounter with the shrew.

11:45.454 --> 11:48.915
- That's your girlfriend's sister.
- That's Bianca's sister?

11:48.999 --> 11:52.293
The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.

11:53.129 --> 11:55.296
- Stay cool, bro.
- Yeah, see you later.

11:56.465 --> 11:57.757
Look out!

12:04.432 --> 12:07.308
My balls! Oh, boy.

12:25.327 --> 12:26.828
Yeah!

13:14.335 --> 13:17.086
Hello, Katarina.
Make anyone cry today?

13:17.546 --> 13:20.048
Sadly, no. But it's only 4:30.

13:21.842 --> 13:24.010
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hello, precious.

13:24.553 --> 13:26.513
- And where have you been?
- Nowhere.

13:26.597 --> 13:29.390
Hey, what's this?
It says Sarah Lawrence.

13:34.104 --> 13:37.565
I got in!

13:38.734 --> 13:39.859
Honey, that's great,

13:39.944 --> 13:41.986
but isn't Sarah Lawrence
on the other side of the country?

13:42.071 --> 13:44.405
Thus the basis of its appeal.

13:44.532 --> 13:46.699
I thought we decided you were
going to stay here and go to school.

13:46.784 --> 13:49.077
"U-Dub," like me. Be a Husky.

13:51.247 --> 13:52.872
No, you decided.

13:53.582 --> 13:56.376
Oh, okay, so what, you just pick up
and leave, is that it?

13:56.460 --> 13:57.919
Let's hope so.

13:58.420 --> 14:00.463
Ask Bianca who drove her home.

14:00.589 --> 14:02.674
Kat, don't change the...
Drove? Who drove you home?

14:02.758 --> 14:05.260
Now, don't get upset, Daddy,
but there's this boy...

14:05.344 --> 14:08.096
- Who's a flaming imbecile.
- And I think he might ask me...

14:08.180 --> 14:10.056
Please. I think I know
what he's going to ask you.

14:10.140 --> 14:12.976
And I think I know the answer. No.
It's always no.

14:13.102 --> 14:14.769
What are the two house rules?

14:14.854 --> 14:17.272
Number one,
no dating till you graduate.

14:17.356 --> 14:20.108
Number two,
no dating till you graduate.

14:20.442 --> 14:23.111
- That's it.
- Daddy, that's so unfair.

14:23.195 --> 14:26.197
All right, you want to know
what's unfair? This is for you, too.

14:26.282 --> 14:29.576
This morning I delivered a set of twins
to a 15-year-old girl.

14:29.660 --> 14:31.202
Do you know what she said to me?

14:31.287 --> 14:32.662
I'm a crack whore who should have

14:32.788 --> 14:35.373
made my skeezy boyfriend
wear a condom?

14:37.626 --> 14:39.627
Close, but no.

14:39.795 --> 14:42.964
She said,
"I should have listened to my father."

14:43.048 --> 14:45.592
- She did not.
- Well, that's what she would have said

14:45.676 --> 14:47.719
if she wasn't so doped up.

14:48.554 --> 14:51.055
Can we focus on me
for a second, please?

14:51.140 --> 14:53.266
I am the only girl in school
who's not dating.

14:53.350 --> 14:54.851
Oh, no, you're not.
Your sister doesn't date.

14:54.977 --> 14:56.227
And I don't intend to.

14:56.312 --> 14:57.937
And why is that again?

14:58.022 --> 15:01.024
Have you seen the unwashed
miscreants that go to that school?

15:01.150 --> 15:03.401
Where did you come from?
Planet Loser?

15:03.485 --> 15:06.487
As opposed to
Planet Look At Me, Look At Me.

15:07.239 --> 15:08.948
Okay, here's how we solve this one.

15:09.033 --> 15:12.869
Old rule out. New rule, Bianca can date

15:15.372 --> 15:16.915
when she does.

15:18.751 --> 15:21.085
But she's a mutant!
What if she never dates?

15:21.170 --> 15:23.546
Then you'll never date. Oh, I like that.

15:23.672 --> 15:26.007
And I'll get to sleep at night.

15:26.175 --> 15:27.258
The deep slumber of a father

15:27.343 --> 15:29.844
whose daughters aren't out
being impregnated.

15:31.847 --> 15:33.848
- We'll talk about Sarah Lawrence later.
- Fine.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.850
- Wait! Daddy!
- Gotta go.

15:37.728 --> 15:39.812
Can't you just find
some blind, deaf retard

15:39.897 --> 15:42.065
to take you to the movies
so I can have one date?

15:42.191 --> 15:44.067
I'm sorry. Looks like
you'll just have to miss out

15:44.193 --> 15:47.111
on the witty repartee
of Joey "Eat Me" Donner.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.907
You suck.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.713
Hi. Can we make this quick?

16:05.798 --> 16:08.257
Roxanne Corinne and Andrew Jarrett
are having an incredibly horrendous

16:08.384 --> 16:10.760
public break-up on the quad, again.

16:11.720 --> 16:14.514
Oh, yeah, okay. I thought that we'd

16:14.598 --> 16:17.934
start with pronunciation,
if that's all right with you.

16:18.060 --> 16:21.437
Not the hacking and gagging
and spitting part, please.

16:21.730 --> 16:24.107
Well, there is an alternative.

16:24.233 --> 16:27.193
- There is?
- Yeah, French food.

16:27.277 --> 16:30.154
We could eat some together

16:31.448 --> 16:33.074
Saturday night?

16:35.744 --> 16:37.620
You're asking me out?

16:38.122 --> 16:40.790
That's so cute.
What's your name again?

16:41.250 --> 16:44.043
Cameron. Listen, I know
that your dad doesn't let you date,

16:44.128 --> 16:46.379
but I thought
that if it was for French class...

16:46.463 --> 16:49.424
- Oh, wait a minute. Curtis...
- Cameron.

16:49.758 --> 16:53.469
My dad just came up with a new rule.
I can date when my sister does.

16:53.637 --> 16:56.139
You're kidding.
Let me ask you, do you like sailing?

16:56.265 --> 16:57.849
'Cause I read about this place
that rents boats...

16:57.933 --> 16:59.767
A beaucoup problemo, Calvin.

16:59.852 --> 17:04.521
In case you haven't heard, my sister's
a particularly hideous breed of loser.

17:04.940 --> 17:08.776
Yeah. Yeah, I noticed
she's a little antisocial.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.820
- Why is that?
- Unsolved mystery.

17:11.946 --> 17:14.406
She used to be really popular,
and then it was like

17:14.491 --> 17:16.617
she got sick of it or something.

17:16.868 --> 17:17.952
Theories abound as to why,

17:18.037 --> 17:21.039
but I'm pretty sure she's just
incapable of human interaction.

17:21.123 --> 17:23.040
Plus, she's a bitch.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.919
Well, yeah, but I'm sure,
you know, that there are

17:27.003 --> 17:30.965
lots of guys who wouldn't mind
going out with a difficult woman.

17:31.216 --> 17:35.178
I mean, you know, people jump
out of airplanes and ski off cliffs.

17:35.304 --> 17:38.473
It'd be like "Extreme Dating."

17:39.850 --> 17:42.602
You think you could find
someone that extreme?

17:42.686 --> 17:44.479
Yeah, sure, why not?

17:44.563 --> 17:47.857
- And you'd do that for me?
- Hell, yes!

17:47.983 --> 17:51.194
I mean, you know, I could look into it.

17:57.076 --> 18:00.912
Now, I have gathered a group of guys,
couldn't be more perfect.

18:00.996 --> 18:02.538
Padua's finest.

18:07.169 --> 18:08.836
Hi. How you doin'?

18:10.172 --> 18:13.841
Would any of you be interested
in dating Katarina Stratford?

18:18.514 --> 18:20.681
I've never been that ripped.

18:21.016 --> 18:23.893
Maybe if we were
the last two people alive,

18:24.019 --> 18:25.812
and there were no sheep.

18:25.896 --> 18:27.021
Are there sheep?

18:34.905 --> 18:37.323
Did I or did I not tell you
it was pointless?

18:37.407 --> 18:39.408
No one will go out with her.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.873
Hey, hey, what about him?

18:46.041 --> 18:48.334
Him? No, don't...
Don't look at him, okay?

18:48.418 --> 18:52.547
He's a criminal.
I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.

18:52.631 --> 18:56.551
- He just did a year in San Quentin.
- Well, at least he's horny.

18:57.386 --> 18:59.303
I'm serious, man. He's whacked.

18:59.388 --> 19:03.891
He sold his own liver on the
black market for a new set of speakers.

19:10.941 --> 19:12.650
He's our guy.

19:30.252 --> 19:32.253
Hi. How you doin'?

19:32.421 --> 19:33.462
Listen, I...

19:36.758 --> 19:38.759
Okay. Later, then.

19:46.101 --> 19:48.436
How do we get him to date Kat?

19:49.521 --> 19:50.980
I don't know.

19:52.024 --> 19:54.108
I mean, we could pay him,

19:55.611 --> 19:57.820
but we don't have any money.

19:58.030 --> 20:00.448
Yeah, well, what we need is a backer.

20:00.616 --> 20:04.285
- What's that?
- Someone with money who's stupid.

20:08.457 --> 20:09.957
Oh, yeah.

20:18.800 --> 20:21.302
Is that a peach Fruit Roll-Up?
Because you don't see many...

20:21.386 --> 20:24.222
Oh, okay. Yeah. All right.

20:25.182 --> 20:26.599
- Are you lost?
- No.

20:26.683 --> 20:28.643
Actually, I just came by to chat.

20:29.811 --> 20:32.188
- We don't chat.
- Well, actually, I thought

20:32.314 --> 20:35.399
that I'd run an idea by you,
just to see if you're interested.

20:35.484 --> 20:37.902
- I'm not.
- Well, hear me out.

20:37.986 --> 20:40.988
Now, you want Bianca, right?

20:41.573 --> 20:44.784
But she can't go out with you
because her sister

20:44.868 --> 20:48.704
is this insane head case, and no one
will go out with her, right?

20:48.830 --> 20:50.623
Does this conversation
have a purpose?

20:50.707 --> 20:52.708
What I think you need to do,

20:52.793 --> 20:55.836
is you need to hire a guy
who'll go out with her.

20:55.921 --> 20:58.464
Someone who doesn't scare so easily.

21:00.384 --> 21:01.968
That guy?

21:02.970 --> 21:06.722
- I heard he ate a live duck once.
- Everything but the beak and feet.

21:06.807 --> 21:09.517
Clearly, he's a solid investment.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.687
- What's in it for you?
- Hey.

21:12.771 --> 21:16.732
I'm walking down the hall and
I say hello to you, you say hello to me.

21:16.817 --> 21:19.860
Yeah, yeah, I get it.
You're cool by association.

21:20.821 --> 21:23.322
I'll think about it.

21:27.035 --> 21:28.911
- We're done now.
- Yeah.

21:33.834 --> 21:35.334
What are you doing
getting him involved?

21:35.419 --> 21:36.669
Relax, now. Relax.

21:36.753 --> 21:38.671
We let him pretend
he's calling the shots.

21:38.755 --> 21:42.717
While he's busy setting things up,
you have time with Bianca.

21:44.553 --> 21:46.929
That is a good idea. All right.

21:49.516 --> 21:52.059
I have a dick on my face, don't I?

21:56.148 --> 21:58.024
Now, remember, guys,

21:58.525 --> 22:01.527
grip it and rip it.

22:15.375 --> 22:17.335
Hey. How you doin'?

22:22.049 --> 22:23.966
I had some great duck last night.

22:26.094 --> 22:27.762
Do I know you?

22:28.597 --> 22:30.431
You see that girl?

22:32.809 --> 22:34.894
- Yeah.
- That's Kat Stratford.

22:35.312 --> 22:37.229
I want you to go out with her.

22:37.689 --> 22:39.523
Yeah, sure, Sparky.

22:41.651 --> 22:45.404
Look, I can't take out her sister
until Kat starts dating.

22:45.489 --> 22:48.240
You see, their dad's whacked out.
He's got this rule where the girls...

22:48.325 --> 22:51.660
That's a touching story. It really is.
Not my problem.

22:52.788 --> 22:54.246
Would you be willing
to make it your problem

22:54.331 --> 22:56.791
if I provide generous compensation?

22:59.419 --> 23:01.420
You're gonna pay me
to take out some chick?

23:04.549 --> 23:07.009
- How much?
- Twenty bucks.

23:15.352 --> 23:16.644
Fine, 30.

23:18.605 --> 23:20.481
Well, let's think about this.

23:20.607 --> 23:24.485
We go to the movies, that's 15 bucks.

23:26.780 --> 23:29.949
We get popcorn, that's 53.

23:31.159 --> 23:33.327
And she'll want Raisinets, right?

23:33.495 --> 23:37.206
So, we're looking at 75 bucks.

23:37.457 --> 23:41.252
This isn't a negotiation.
Take it or leave it, Trailer Park.

23:41.795 --> 23:44.422
Fifty bucks and we got a deal, Fabio.

23:48.969 --> 23:51.637
Great practise, everybody.

23:51.721 --> 23:54.723
- Good hustle, Stratford.
- Thanks, Mr Chapin.

24:03.817 --> 24:06.777
Hey there, girlie. How you doin'?

24:07.237 --> 24:09.447
Sweating like a pig, actually.
And yourself?

24:09.531 --> 24:11.949
Now, there's a way to get
a guy's attention, huh?

24:12.492 --> 24:14.160
My mission in life.

24:14.244 --> 24:16.954
But obviously, I struck your fancy,
so, you see, it worked.

24:17.038 --> 24:18.706
The world makes sense again.

24:20.459 --> 24:23.836
- Pick you up on Friday, then.
- Oh, right. Friday.

24:25.297 --> 24:28.466
Well, the night I take you places
you've never been before.

24:28.550 --> 24:30.759
Like where?
The 7-Eleven on Broadway?

24:30.844 --> 24:33.512
Do you even know
my name, screw boy?

24:33.597 --> 24:35.764
I know a lot more than you think.

24:35.849 --> 24:37.808
Doubtful. Very doubtful.

24:45.108 --> 24:46.192
We are screwed.

24:46.276 --> 24:48.235
Hey, I don't want to hear
that defeatist attitude.

24:48.320 --> 24:51.363
- I want to hear you upbeat.
- We're screwed!

24:51.448 --> 24:53.491
- There you go.
- Hey, Coach Chapin!

24:58.955 --> 25:00.498
Run, Bogey!

25:07.714 --> 25:09.840
Have you ever considered a new look?

25:09.925 --> 25:12.259
I mean, seriously. You could
have some definite potential

25:12.344 --> 25:14.428
buried under all this hostility.

25:14.513 --> 25:17.223
I'm not hostile. I'm annoyed.

25:17.390 --> 25:19.391
Why don't you try being nice?

25:19.476 --> 25:21.310
People wouldn't know what to think.

25:21.394 --> 25:23.562
You forget,
I don't care what people think.

25:23.647 --> 25:25.022
Yes, you do.

25:25.440 --> 25:26.899
No, I don't.

25:28.401 --> 25:31.070
You don't always have to be
who they want you to be, you know.

25:32.405 --> 25:35.157
I happen to like being adored,
thank you.

25:35.992 --> 25:37.618
Where'd you get the pearls?

25:37.702 --> 25:39.203
They're Mom's.

25:39.788 --> 25:42.414
And you've been what,
hiding them for three years?

25:42.499 --> 25:44.708
No. Daddy found them
in a drawer last week.

25:44.793 --> 25:46.752
So you're just gonna start
wearing them now?

25:46.836 --> 25:49.797
It's not like she's coming back
to claim them!

25:51.258 --> 25:54.593
Besides, they look good on me.

25:55.887 --> 25:57.680
Trust me. They don't.

26:03.186 --> 26:05.646
Nice ride. Vintage fenders.

26:05.897 --> 26:08.107
Are you following me?

26:08.191 --> 26:11.402
I was in the Laundromat.
I saw your car. I came over to say hi.

26:11.486 --> 26:12.570
Hi.

26:14.781 --> 26:17.700
- Not a big talker, huh?
- Depends on the topic.

26:17.784 --> 26:20.703
My fenders don't really whip me
into a verbal frenzy.

26:20.787 --> 26:24.498
- You're not afraid of me, are you?
- Why would I be afraid of you?

26:24.583 --> 26:27.084
- Well, most people are.
- Well, I'm not.

26:27.168 --> 26:28.210
Well, maybe you're not afraid of me,

26:28.295 --> 26:31.130
but I'm sure
you've thought about me naked.

26:31.631 --> 26:33.507
Am I that transparent?

26:33.717 --> 26:36.468
I want you, I need you.
Oh, baby, oh, baby.

26:46.104 --> 26:48.230
What is it, asshole day?

26:48.898 --> 26:51.108
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.

27:01.828 --> 27:03.412
You bitch!

27:07.584 --> 27:08.667
Whoops.

27:09.085 --> 27:10.502
"Whoops"?

27:11.588 --> 27:14.173
My insurance does not cover PMS!

27:16.134 --> 27:18.969
Well, then tell them I had a seizure.

27:19.054 --> 27:20.137
Is this about Sarah Lawrence?

27:20.221 --> 27:22.389
Are you punishing me because
I want you to stay close to home?

27:22.474 --> 27:25.184
Aren't you punishing me
because Mom left?

27:25.268 --> 27:27.186
You think you could
leave her out of this?

27:27.270 --> 27:29.355
Fine.
Then stop making my decisions for me.

27:29.439 --> 27:31.357
I'm your father. That's my right.

27:31.441 --> 27:33.609
So what I want doesn't matter.

27:34.069 --> 27:35.361
You're 18.
You don't know what you want.

27:35.445 --> 27:37.696
And you won't know
what you want till you're 45,

27:37.781 --> 27:40.115
and even if you get it,
you'll be too old to use it.

27:40.200 --> 27:42.034
I want to go to an East Coast school!

27:42.118 --> 27:43.702
I want you to trust me
to make my own choices,

27:43.787 --> 27:45.579
and I want you to stop trying
to control my life

27:45.664 --> 27:48.248
just because you can't control yours!

27:48.500 --> 27:50.459
Yeah? Well, you know what I want?

27:53.630 --> 27:54.880
We'll continue this later.

27:54.964 --> 27:56.340
Can't wait.

27:58.843 --> 28:01.011
Did you just maim Joey's car?

28:01.096 --> 28:03.097
Yeah. Looks like you're gonna
have to take the bus.

28:03.181 --> 28:05.307
Has the fact
that you're completely psycho

28:05.392 --> 28:07.685
managed to escape your attention?

28:08.895 --> 28:10.104
Daddy!

28:15.360 --> 28:19.279
- When I shell out 50, I expect results.
- Yeah, I'm on it.

28:19.531 --> 28:22.908
Watching that bitch violate my car
doesn't count as a date.

28:22.992 --> 28:25.953
Now, if you don't get any,
I don't get any.

28:26.788 --> 28:28.372
So get some.

28:29.666 --> 28:31.542
I just upped my price.

28:32.085 --> 28:34.753
- What?
- Hundred bucks a date.

28:35.588 --> 28:38.674
- In advance.
- Forget it.

28:38.925 --> 28:41.176
Well, forget her sister, then.

28:45.557 --> 28:49.309
You better hope you're as smooth
as you think you are, Verona.

29:01.030 --> 29:02.448
- Go.
- No, you go.

29:02.532 --> 29:04.074
I went before.

29:12.751 --> 29:15.627
We know what you're trying to do
with Kat Stratford.

29:15.712 --> 29:18.797
Is that right?
What do you plan to do about it?

29:18.882 --> 29:21.133
- Help you out.
- Why's that?

29:22.969 --> 29:24.303
The situation is,

29:24.387 --> 29:28.348
my man Cameron here
has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.

29:29.642 --> 29:31.769
What is it with this chick?
She have beer-flavoured nipples?

29:31.853 --> 29:35.439
- Hey!
- I... I think I speak correctly

29:35.523 --> 29:38.150
when I say that Cameron's love is pure,

29:38.234 --> 29:40.068
purer than, say, Joey Donner's.

29:40.153 --> 29:42.404
I'm in this for the cash.
Donner can plow whoever he wants.

29:42.489 --> 29:44.823
Okay, there will be no plowing.

29:45.492 --> 29:47.493
Patrick... Pat...

29:48.077 --> 29:50.204
Let me explain something to you here.

29:50.288 --> 29:54.166
We set this whole thing up
so Cameron can get the girl. Cameron.

29:54.250 --> 29:56.043
Joey's just a pawn.

29:59.506 --> 30:01.340
So, you two are gonna
help me tame the wild beast.

30:01.424 --> 30:02.549
Absolutely.

30:02.634 --> 30:05.636
We'll do some research,
we'll find out what she likes.

30:05.720 --> 30:07.387
We're your guys.

30:07.472 --> 30:11.683
And he means that in
a strictly non-prison movie type of way.

30:13.561 --> 30:14.770
Let's start here.

30:14.854 --> 30:18.524
Now, Friday night,
Bogey Lowenstein is having a party.

30:18.608 --> 30:20.734
It's the perfect opportunity.

30:20.819 --> 30:24.488
- Perfect opportunity for what?
- For you to take out Kat.

30:26.533 --> 30:28.200
I'll think about it.

30:29.536 --> 30:32.204
And for a little payback.

30:32.622 --> 30:34.748
This is gonna be some party.

30:44.342 --> 30:45.884
Let's do this.

31:06.739 --> 31:09.366
Now, this is really important, okay?

31:09.701 --> 31:11.994
Which one do you like better?

31:16.416 --> 31:19.751
I think I like the white shirt better.

31:19.836 --> 31:22.337
- Yeah, it's... It's more...
- Pensive?

31:23.715 --> 31:26.216
Damn. I was going for thoughtful.

31:26.426 --> 31:27.926
So, are you going to
Bogey Lowenbrau's thing

31:28.011 --> 31:29.469
on Friday night?

31:29.554 --> 31:31.221
Yeah, I might.

31:31.306 --> 31:35.392
Good, 'cause you know, I'm not
gonna bother if you won't be there.

31:38.605 --> 31:39.980
See you there.

31:40.064 --> 31:41.773
- Okay.
- All right.

31:58.374 --> 32:01.460
So, have you heard
about Bogey Lowenstein's party?

32:01.544 --> 32:05.505
Yes, and I really, really,
really want to go.

32:05.632 --> 32:09.217
But you know I can't.
Not unless my sister does.

32:09.302 --> 32:11.720
Yeah, I know.
I'm working on that, but so far,

32:11.804 --> 32:14.348
you know, she's not going for my guy.

32:14.641 --> 32:17.893
- She's not a...
- K.D. Lang fan? No.

32:18.019 --> 32:20.520
I found a picture of Jared Leto
in her drawer once,

32:20.605 --> 32:23.857
so I'm pretty sure she's not
harbouring same-sex tendencies.

32:23.942 --> 32:27.945
Okay, so that's the kind of guys
she likes... Like, pretty guys.

32:28.029 --> 32:29.655
I don't know. All I've ever heard her say

32:29.739 --> 32:32.950
is that she'd die
before dating a guy that smokes.

32:33.159 --> 32:35.202
Okay, all right, no smoking. What else?

32:35.286 --> 32:37.204
You're asking me
to investigate the inner workings

32:37.288 --> 32:39.164
of my sister's twisted mind?

32:39.248 --> 32:41.208
I don't think so.

32:41.918 --> 32:43.001
Well, nothing else has worked.

32:43.086 --> 32:45.837
We need to go
behind enemy lines here.

32:50.635 --> 32:52.219
Okay, here we go.

32:53.596 --> 32:55.639
Class schedule, reading list,

32:55.723 --> 32:59.267
date book, concert tickets,
concert tickets.

33:04.857 --> 33:07.067
Black panties!

33:07.151 --> 33:09.111
What does that tell us?

33:09.404 --> 33:11.697
She wants to have sex someday,
that's what.

33:11.781 --> 33:14.116
You... She could just like the colour.

33:14.200 --> 33:17.244
You don't buy black lingerie
unless you want someone to see it.

33:19.664 --> 33:23.667
So... Can I see your room?

33:25.169 --> 33:26.253
No.

33:29.841 --> 33:32.217
A girl's room is very personal.

33:33.428 --> 33:34.761
Oh, okay.

33:46.357 --> 33:48.734
- Nice bike.
- Yeah, you think so?

34:03.624 --> 34:06.043
Wow. Is this what a bar looks like?

34:07.754 --> 34:10.755
Don't touch anything.
You may get hepatitis.

34:22.601 --> 34:23.685
So, what have you got for me?

34:23.770 --> 34:27.355
A little insight
into a very complicated girl.

34:28.190 --> 34:31.025
Excuse me.
Just one question before we start.

34:31.152 --> 34:34.112
Should you be drinking alcohol
when you don't have a liver?

34:34.197 --> 34:36.197
- What?
- Nothing. Nothing.

34:37.949 --> 34:41.953
All right, first thing. Kat hates smokers.

34:45.123 --> 34:48.627
So, you're telling me I'm a non-smoker.

34:48.710 --> 34:53.090
- Yes. Well, just for now.
- And here's another problem.

34:53.174 --> 34:56.842
Bianca said that Kat likes pretty guys.

35:04.435 --> 35:06.478
Are you telling me I'm not a pretty guy?

35:06.562 --> 35:07.813
He's very pretty!

35:07.897 --> 35:11.650
- This is a gorgeous guy.
- I just wasn't sure. I didn't know.

35:14.070 --> 35:16.780
All right. Yeah, okay. Here's this.

35:18.908 --> 35:20.158
"Likes.

35:20.535 --> 35:24.621
"Thai food, feminist prose
and angry girl music

35:24.705 --> 35:27.040
"of the indie rock persuasion."

35:27.125 --> 35:29.835
Here's a list of CDs
she has in her room.

35:32.505 --> 35:34.506
So, I'm supposed to buy her
some noodles and a book

35:34.590 --> 35:37.384
and sit around listening to chicks
who can't play their instruments, right?

35:37.468 --> 35:39.886
Have you ever been to Club Skunk?

35:40.012 --> 35:42.681
Her favourite band's
playing there tomorrow night.

35:42.765 --> 35:45.016
I can't be seen at Club Skunk, all right?

35:45.101 --> 35:46.852
But she'll be there. She's got tickets.

35:46.936 --> 35:49.271
Assail your ears for one night.

35:52.275 --> 35:54.943
She has a pair of black underwear.

35:55.403 --> 35:57.195
If that helps.

35:57.738 --> 35:59.531
Couldn't hurt, right?

37:16.901 --> 37:19.277
Verona! What are you doing here?

37:20.279 --> 37:21.696
I need agua!

37:27.912 --> 37:29.496
Two waters.

37:37.255 --> 37:40.131
If you're planning on asking me out,
you might as well just get it over with.

37:40.216 --> 37:43.635
Do you mind?
You're kind of ruining this for me.

37:43.886 --> 37:46.096
You're not surrounded by
your usual cloud of smoke.

37:46.180 --> 37:49.140
I know. I quit.
Apparently they're bad for you.

37:49.225 --> 37:50.600
You think?

37:52.436 --> 37:55.647
You know, these guys
are no Bikini Kill or the Raincoats.

37:55.731 --> 37:57.732
But they're not bad.

38:01.570 --> 38:04.739
- You know who the Raincoats are?
- Why, don't you?

38:07.410 --> 38:10.578
I was watching you out there before.
I've never seen you look so sexy.

38:20.339 --> 38:24.384
- Come to Bogey's party with me.
- You never give up, do you?

38:26.595 --> 38:27.804
Was that a yes?

38:27.888 --> 38:31.182
- No.
- Well, then, was that a no?

38:31.267 --> 38:34.352
- No.
- I'll see you at 9:30 then!

38:45.448 --> 38:47.615
Should have used the window.

38:48.367 --> 38:50.035
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi.

38:51.662 --> 38:53.330
Where are we going?

38:53.414 --> 38:56.875
Well, if you must know,
a small study group of friends.

38:57.043 --> 38:59.210
Otherwise known as an orgy?

38:59.503 --> 39:01.546
Mr Stratford, it's just a party.

39:01.630 --> 39:03.673
And hell is just a sauna.

39:04.717 --> 39:07.052
Do you know anything about a party?

39:07.219 --> 39:10.972
- People expect me to be there.
- Kat's not going, you're not going.

39:11.057 --> 39:13.391
Why can't you be normal?

39:13.476 --> 39:16.227
- Define "normal."
- Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal.

39:16.312 --> 39:18.897
- What's a Bogey Lowenstein?
- Bogey's party is just a lame excuse

39:18.981 --> 39:20.690
for all the idiots at our school
to drink beer

39:20.775 --> 39:22.150
and rub up against each other

39:22.234 --> 39:24.361
in hopes of distracting themselves
from the pathetic emptiness

39:24.445 --> 39:25.528
of their meaningless...

39:25.613 --> 39:28.406
- Meaningless, consumer-driven lives.
- Meaningless, consumer-driven lives.

39:29.700 --> 39:31.117
Can you, for just one night,

39:31.202 --> 39:34.662
forget that you're completely wretched
and be my sister?

39:34.914 --> 39:39.125
Please?

39:41.837 --> 39:44.881
Come on, Kat. Please do this for me.

39:47.259 --> 39:49.135
Fine. I'll make an appearance.

39:55.059 --> 39:57.977
- It's starting.
- It's just a party, Daddy.

40:01.023 --> 40:03.233
I want you to wear the belly.

40:03.567 --> 40:04.943
Daddy, no.

40:05.569 --> 40:07.070
Not all night.

40:07.154 --> 40:10.031
Just around the living room for a minute
so you can understand

40:10.116 --> 40:12.742
the full weight of your decisions.

40:14.787 --> 40:16.955
- I am perfectly aware...
- Listen to me.

40:17.039 --> 40:19.374
Every time you even think
about kissing a boy,

40:19.458 --> 40:22.168
I want you to picture wearing this
under your halter top.

40:22.253 --> 40:24.337
You are so completely unbalanced.

40:24.422 --> 40:27.298
- We're going now.
- All right, wait a minute.

40:27.633 --> 40:29.551
No drinking, no drugs, no kissing,

40:29.635 --> 40:33.847
no tattoos, no piercings,
no ritual animal slaughters of any kind.

40:34.181 --> 40:36.141
Oh, God, I'm giving them ideas.

40:36.642 --> 40:37.851
Daddy!

40:38.936 --> 40:41.479
- What are you doing here?
- 9:30, right?

40:41.647 --> 40:44.983
- Oh, I'm early.
- Whatever. I'm driving.

40:46.193 --> 40:48.153
Who knocked up your sister?

40:51.323 --> 40:53.700
So then, Bianca says that I was right,

40:53.784 --> 40:56.453
that she didn't wear the Kenneth Coles
with that dress

40:56.537 --> 41:00.165
because she thought that it was
mixing genres, right?

41:00.332 --> 41:04.127
And the fact that I noticed,
and this is a direct quote, listen,

41:04.211 --> 41:06.504
"Really meant something."

41:06.589 --> 41:08.840
You told me that part already.

41:09.300 --> 41:10.800
I've been thinking about her
all the time.

41:10.885 --> 41:15.430
Stop being so self-involved
for one minute. How do I look?

41:16.307 --> 41:18.933
You look like my Great Uncle Milton.

41:19.185 --> 41:21.394
- You think I should lose the tie?
- Yeah.

41:21.479 --> 41:24.063
Maybe you're right. I'm just so nervous.

41:24.148 --> 41:27.025
And I'm also very excited.
I'm nervous, I'm excited.

41:27.193 --> 41:28.985
It's all very mixed up.
I don't know what to do!

41:29.069 --> 41:31.779
All right, just calm down, all right?

41:32.198 --> 41:35.116
The last party I went to
was at Chuck E. Cheese.

41:35.743 --> 41:39.078
You want to talk about some fun.
That's a good time.

42:02.895 --> 42:05.730
Now, remember, guys.
Don't touch anything.

42:08.776 --> 42:10.735
What did I tell you?

42:12.905 --> 42:15.114
Must be Nigel with the Brie.

42:41.767 --> 42:44.894
You know, I'm...
I'm thinking of getting a Tercel.

42:46.063 --> 42:47.981
Yeah, that's a Toyota.

42:49.775 --> 42:53.278
It has dual side air bags
and a spacious back seat.

43:00.077 --> 43:02.370
- Kiss me!
- Kiss him.

43:02.454 --> 43:03.913
- Okay.
- Good.

43:08.127 --> 43:09.210
Hey, thanks, man!

43:13.173 --> 43:14.465
Sweet.

43:15.509 --> 43:17.885
Looking fresh tonight, pussycat.

43:18.470 --> 43:21.681
Wait. Was that...
Did your hairline just recede?

43:22.766 --> 43:25.101
- Hey, where are you goin'?
- Away.

43:25.728 --> 43:27.979
- Your sister here?
- Stay away from my sister.

43:28.063 --> 43:30.690
Oh, I'll stay away from your sister.

43:30.816 --> 43:33.151
But I can't guarantee
she'll stay away from me.

43:33.652 --> 43:37.488
- Fight!
- Fight!

43:45.164 --> 43:47.040
You guys, please! Take it outside!

43:53.088 --> 43:54.547
Thank you!

43:56.967 --> 43:59.677
Hey, Kat. Look who found me.

44:01.180 --> 44:04.390
- Bianca, wait.
- Please do not address me in public.

44:04.475 --> 44:05.683
No, there's something I need to tell you.

44:05.768 --> 44:10.104
I am busy enjoying my adolescence,
so scamper off and do the same.

44:10.189 --> 44:11.356
Bu-bye.

44:14.902 --> 44:16.152
Want one?

44:17.071 --> 44:19.489
- What is this?
- Right on, sister!

44:20.824 --> 44:22.867
I've been looking
all over the place for you.

44:22.951 --> 44:25.662
I'm getting trashed, man. Isn't that
what you're supposed to do at a party?

44:25.746 --> 44:28.039
I don't know.
I say do what you want to do.

44:28.123 --> 44:30.124
Funny. You're the only one.

44:30.501 --> 44:31.709
Later.

44:44.431 --> 44:46.974
Lord of the dance! Hi, Heather.

44:47.059 --> 44:49.894
- Bite me.
- Should've kept the tie.

44:50.062 --> 44:52.939
Hey. Hey, have you seen her
around anywhere?

44:53.148 --> 44:55.191
- Relax.
- Relax? I'm fine.

44:56.360 --> 44:57.860
Follow the love.

45:00.948 --> 45:02.323
Hi, Bianca.

45:03.283 --> 45:04.951
Oh, hi, Cameron.

45:07.329 --> 45:09.288
You know Chastity?

45:10.332 --> 45:13.584
Yeah. I think
we have art together, right?

45:13.669 --> 45:14.836
Neat.

45:16.755 --> 45:18.756
So, you...

45:19.425 --> 45:21.384
You really look amazing.

45:22.761 --> 45:25.596
- Thanks.
- And we all know I look amazing.

45:27.141 --> 45:28.224
Yeah.

45:28.308 --> 45:32.145
Bianca, let's go. We're all
congregating around Mr Cuervo.

45:32.855 --> 45:34.897
I'll see you around, okay?

45:47.786 --> 45:49.704
So, I've got
the Sears catalogue thing going,

45:49.788 --> 45:53.040
and the tube sock gig,
that is gonna be huge.

45:55.961 --> 45:58.296
And I'm up for
a haemorrhoid cream ad next week.

45:58.380 --> 46:00.882
I know it sounds kind of bogus, but...

46:00.966 --> 46:03.009
I get to do some acting.

46:11.560 --> 46:13.603
You see what I did there?

46:14.813 --> 46:18.024
That was underwear. I'll show you
the bathing suit one again.

46:20.986 --> 46:22.904
You see the difference?

46:24.573 --> 46:26.491
All right, I'll show you guys.

46:57.356 --> 47:00.024
Is it me, or does this party
all of a sudden suck?

47:06.824 --> 47:08.950
Really, really,

47:09.076 --> 47:10.451
thank you!

47:11.370 --> 47:13.913
Hey. Hey, Kat, why don't you
let me have this one, huh?

47:13.997 --> 47:15.790
No! This one's mine.

47:16.917 --> 47:19.877
My man! How did you get her to do it?

47:19.962 --> 47:21.671
- Do what?
- Act like a human.

47:24.132 --> 47:25.716
Yeah! All right!

47:26.510 --> 47:27.593
Go!

47:32.307 --> 47:33.724
See this?

48:05.966 --> 48:08.009
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

48:10.929 --> 48:12.930
You're not fine. Come on.

48:14.683 --> 48:15.933
I just need to lie down.

48:16.018 --> 48:18.311
You lie down and you'll go to sleep.

48:18.395 --> 48:21.063
- Sleep is good.
- Not if you have a concussion.

48:21.273 --> 48:23.232
Come on. Here, sit down.

48:24.568 --> 48:27.111
- Sit.
- Hey, hey, we need to talk.

48:27.195 --> 48:30.781
- I'm a little busy right now.
- Can you give me a second?

48:35.037 --> 48:37.246
- What?
- It's off, okay? The whole thing's off.

48:37.331 --> 48:39.415
What are you talking about?

48:40.125 --> 48:43.169
She never wanted me.
She wanted Joey the whole time.

48:43.253 --> 48:45.421
Cameron, do you like the girl?

48:45.881 --> 48:48.799
- Yeah.
- And is she worth all this trouble?

48:49.343 --> 48:50.801
I thought she was, but, you know, I...

48:50.886 --> 48:52.803
Well, she is or she isn't.

48:52.888 --> 48:55.473
See, first of all,
Joey is not half the man you are.

48:55.557 --> 48:57.475
Secondly, don't let anyone
ever make you feel

48:57.559 --> 49:00.186
like you don't deserve what you want.

49:00.729 --> 49:02.104
Go for it!

49:06.068 --> 49:07.610
- Come on.
- Why?

49:18.413 --> 49:19.580
This is so patronising.

49:19.665 --> 49:22.249
Leave it to you to use
big words when you're smashed.

49:22.334 --> 49:25.336
- I don't think so.
- Kat.

49:27.172 --> 49:30.257
- Why are you doing this?
- I told you. You may have a concussion.

49:30.342 --> 49:31.884
You don't care if I never wake up.

49:31.969 --> 49:34.011
- Sure I do.
- Why?

49:34.262 --> 49:37.181
Because then I'd have to start
taking out girls who actually like me.

49:37.265 --> 49:39.392
- Like you could find one.
- Oh, see? That, there.

49:39.476 --> 49:41.560
Who needs affection
when I have blind hatred?

49:41.645 --> 49:45.106
- I just... Let me sit down for a while.
- All right. There.

50:00.539 --> 50:02.623
- So, why'd you let him get to you?
- Who?

50:02.708 --> 50:04.917
- Joey.
- I hate him.

50:07.045 --> 50:10.673
Well, you've chosen the perfect
revenge, mainlining tequila.

50:12.050 --> 50:15.511
- Well, you know what they say.
- Nope. What do they say?

50:16.722 --> 50:19.932
No, no, no, no. Kat, come on, wake up!
Look at me!

50:20.475 --> 50:23.019
Listen to me, Kat! Open your eyes!

50:28.942 --> 50:30.067
Hey.

50:31.069 --> 50:33.237
Your eyes have a little green in them.

50:51.256 --> 50:52.673
I don't know if we should go.

50:52.758 --> 50:55.676
Hey, a bunch of us
are going to Jarrett's. Ready?

50:55.761 --> 50:58.262
I have to be home in 20 minutes.

50:58.430 --> 51:01.682
Well, you know I don't have to be home
till 2:00, so...

51:02.017 --> 51:05.728
- One more chance.
- Man, I can't.

51:05.937 --> 51:07.980
- Damn.
- That's a shame.

51:09.357 --> 51:11.275
- You wanna go?
- Sure.

51:11.359 --> 51:13.444
- Chastity!
- Hey, you passed.

51:14.529 --> 51:15.738
Bitch.

51:20.327 --> 51:22.828
- Hey. Have fun tonight?
- Tons.

51:23.872 --> 51:26.082
Hey, Cameron?

51:27.459 --> 51:30.419
Do you think you could
give me a ride home?

51:33.924 --> 51:35.633
I should do this.

51:35.717 --> 51:37.426
- Do what?
- This!

51:38.637 --> 51:41.472
- Start a band?
- No, install car stereos.

51:41.640 --> 51:45.142
Yeah, start a band.
My father would love that.

51:58.532 --> 52:02.493
You don't strike me as the type that
would ask your father for permission.

52:02.577 --> 52:05.996
- Oh, so now you think you know me?
- I'm getting there.

52:06.081 --> 52:09.500
The only thing people know
about me is that I'm scary.

52:10.836 --> 52:13.504
Yeah, well, I'm no picnic myself.

52:21.555 --> 52:25.516
So what's up with your dad?
Is he... Is he a pain in the ass?

52:25.600 --> 52:27.977
No, he just wants me to be
somebody that I'm not.

52:28.061 --> 52:29.770
- Who?
- Bianca.

52:29.855 --> 52:31.272
Oh, Bianca.

52:35.110 --> 52:38.070
No offence or anything... I mean
I know everyone "digs" your sister,

52:38.155 --> 52:40.865
but she's without.

52:48.373 --> 52:49.623
You know,

52:51.710 --> 52:54.461
you're not as vile
as I thought you were.

53:05.098 --> 53:07.808
Maybe we should do this another time.

53:52.395 --> 53:55.481
You never wanted
to go sailing with me, did you?

53:56.983 --> 53:58.275
Yes, I did.

53:59.694 --> 54:01.153
No, you didn't.

54:02.906 --> 54:05.532
Okay, no, not actually...

54:05.617 --> 54:08.327
Well, then that's all you had to say.

54:10.538 --> 54:12.998
Have you always been this selfish?

54:16.127 --> 54:17.503
Yes.

54:21.424 --> 54:22.758
You know, just 'cause you're beautiful,

54:22.842 --> 54:27.012
that doesn't mean that you can
treat people like they don't matter.

54:27.264 --> 54:30.099
I mean, I really liked you, okay.

54:30.183 --> 54:33.018
I defended you
when people called you conceited,

54:33.103 --> 54:35.187
I helped you when you asked me to,

54:35.272 --> 54:39.441
I learnt French for you and then
you just blow me off so you could...

55:09.764 --> 55:11.849
And I'm back in the game!

55:15.312 --> 55:19.606
Kat, me lady.
You sway to the rhythm of me heart.

55:19.899 --> 55:21.608
Dance for me, cowgirl.

55:21.735 --> 55:24.987
Kat, babe, what do we owe you
for the table dance?

55:26.114 --> 55:28.574
All right, not that I give a damn,
but how was everybody's weekend?

55:28.658 --> 55:31.452
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe we should ask Kat.

55:32.037 --> 55:34.163
Unless she kicked the crap
out of your dumb butt,

55:34.247 --> 55:36.206
I don't wanna hear about it.

55:36.291 --> 55:41.045
Okay, let's open up our books
to page 73, Sonnet 141.

55:41.129 --> 55:42.588
And listen up.

55:42.672 --> 55:44.631
"In faith, I do not love thee
with mine eyes

55:44.716 --> 55:46.842
"For they in thee
a thousand errors note

55:46.926 --> 55:49.053
"But 'tis my heart that loves
what they despise

55:49.137 --> 55:51.972
"Who, in despite of view,
is pleas'd to dote"

55:53.600 --> 55:56.769
Now, I know Shakespeare's
a dead white guy,

55:56.853 --> 55:59.396
but he knows his shit,
so we can overlook that.

55:59.481 --> 56:02.232
I want you all to write
your own version of this sonnet.

56:04.652 --> 56:07.696
Yes, Miss I-Have-An-Opinion-
About-Everything?

56:07.864 --> 56:10.491
Do you want this in iambic pentameter?

56:11.326 --> 56:13.035
You're not gonna fight me on this?

56:13.119 --> 56:15.871
No, I think
it's a really good assignment.

56:16.831 --> 56:18.207
You're just
messin' with me, aren't you?

56:18.291 --> 56:21.126
No, I'm really looking forward
to writing it.

56:21.211 --> 56:22.461
Get out of my class.

56:22.545 --> 56:24.880
- What?
- Out. Get out!

56:31.805 --> 56:34.098
- Thanks, Mr Morgan.
- Shut up.

56:57.831 --> 57:00.707
Hey. Cool picture.

57:01.709 --> 57:04.461
What's that collar for? Is that
to keep him from licking his stitches?

57:08.091 --> 57:12.177
Kidding. No, because I know
you're a fan of Shakespeare.

57:12.262 --> 57:15.556
More than a fan. We're involved.

57:16.516 --> 57:17.683
Okay.

57:19.352 --> 57:22.312
"Who could refrain
That had a heart to love

57:23.064 --> 57:26.650
- "and in that heart..."
- "Courage to make love known."

57:27.527 --> 57:29.945
- That's Macbeth, right?
- Right.

57:32.323 --> 57:35.284
So, listen, I... I have this friend,

57:36.327 --> 57:38.328
and he likes your friend...

57:45.712 --> 57:47.546
What did you do to her?

57:47.630 --> 57:49.923
I didn't do anything. She would've been
too drunk to remember.

57:50.008 --> 57:51.800
But the plan was working.

57:51.885 --> 57:54.678
What do you care?
I thought you wanted out.

57:55.013 --> 57:57.473
Yeah, well, I did, but

57:57.557 --> 57:59.683
that was until she kissed me.

58:01.019 --> 58:03.145
- Where?
- In the car.

58:06.566 --> 58:07.649
Sorry.

58:07.734 --> 58:09.568
- Dweeb! Putz!
- I'm sorry.

58:09.652 --> 58:11.570
All right, I talked to her.

58:11.654 --> 58:12.905
- I got the scoop.
- What'd she say?

58:12.989 --> 58:15.449
"Hates him with the fire
of a thousand suns."

58:15.533 --> 58:17.367
That's a direct quote.

58:17.869 --> 58:21.038
Thanks, Michael.
That's very comforting of you.

58:21.831 --> 58:24.958
We don't know.
She could need a day to cool off.

58:31.841 --> 58:33.217
Maybe two.

58:43.144 --> 58:44.186
Hey!

58:44.270 --> 58:48.065
Can you imagine who would go
to that antiquated mating ritual?

58:48.274 --> 58:50.609
I would, but I don't have a date.

58:51.027 --> 58:52.402
Do you really want
to get all dressed up,

58:52.487 --> 58:55.906
so some Drakkar Noir-wearing dexter
with a boner can feel you up

58:55.990 --> 58:59.201
while you're forced to listen
to a band that by definition blows?

58:59.285 --> 59:01.203
All right, all right, we won't go.

59:01.287 --> 59:03.872
It's not like I've got a dress anyway.

59:04.332 --> 59:06.792
You're looking at this
from entirely the wrong perspective.

59:06.876 --> 59:08.377
We're making a statement.

59:08.461 --> 59:11.880
Oh, goody.
Something new and different for us.

59:29.148 --> 59:32.609
- Hey there, Cupid.
- Hi, Joey.

59:33.069 --> 59:36.405
You're concentrating awfully hard
considering it's gym class.

59:37.323 --> 59:40.450
- Can I help you?
- I want to talk to you about prom.

59:46.082 --> 59:49.084
Look, you know the deal.
I can't go if Kat doesn't go.

59:49.168 --> 59:51.086
Your sister is going.

59:52.130 --> 59:56.258
- Since when?
- Let's just say I'm taking care of it.

01:00:01.347 --> 01:00:04.808
This should take care of the
flowers, the limo, the tux, everything.

01:00:04.892 --> 01:00:07.352
Just make sure she gets to the prom.

01:00:07.729 --> 01:00:11.023
Do you know what?
I'm sick of playing your little game.

01:00:11.107 --> 01:00:12.941
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

01:00:13.026 --> 01:00:16.445
You sick of, let's say, 300?

01:01:39.112 --> 01:01:41.113
Excuse me. Have you
seen The Feminine Mystique?

01:01:41.197 --> 01:01:42.322
I've lost my copy.

01:01:42.407 --> 01:01:45.492
- What are you doing here?
- I heard there was a poetry reading.

01:01:45.576 --> 01:01:47.494
- You're so...
- Charming.

01:01:48.413 --> 01:01:50.205
Wholesome.

01:01:50.289 --> 01:01:51.790
Unwelcome.

01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:56.878
You're not as mean as you think
you are, you know that?

01:01:56.963 --> 01:01:59.381
And you're not as badass
as you think you are.

01:01:59.465 --> 01:02:01.800
Someone still has her panties in a twist.

01:02:01.884 --> 01:02:05.137
Don't for one minute think that you had
any effect whatsoever on my panties.

01:02:05.221 --> 01:02:06.680
Then what did I have an effect on?

01:02:06.764 --> 01:02:09.558
Other than my upchuck reflex, nothing.

01:02:22.071 --> 01:02:24.239
You're right, she's still pissed.

01:02:24.323 --> 01:02:26.366
"Sweet love, renew thy force"

01:02:26.451 --> 01:02:30.412
Hey! Don't say shit like that to me.
People can hear you.

01:02:30.496 --> 01:02:32.372
Look, you embarrassed the girl.

01:02:32.457 --> 01:02:36.084
Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity
and even the score.

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:42.424
Listen, don't say shit like that to him.

01:02:42.759 --> 01:02:44.593
People can hear you.

01:03:15.082 --> 01:03:18.919
You're just too good to be true

01:03:19.003 --> 01:03:22.798
Can't take my eyes off of you

01:03:22.882 --> 01:03:25.842
You'd be like heaven to touch

01:03:26.511 --> 01:03:29.429
I wanna hold you so much

01:03:30.431 --> 01:03:33.683
At long last love has arrived

01:03:34.435 --> 01:03:37.437
And I thank God I'm alive

01:03:38.314 --> 01:03:41.233
You're just too good to be true

01:03:42.068 --> 01:03:45.946
Can't take my eyes off of you

01:04:02.922 --> 01:04:05.590
I love you, baby

01:04:05.716 --> 01:04:09.511
And if it's quite all right
I need you, baby

01:04:09.595 --> 01:04:13.849
To warm the lonely night
I love you, baby

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:18.270
Trust in me when I say

01:04:18.396 --> 01:04:20.939
Oh, pretty baby

01:04:21.023 --> 01:04:24.776
Don't bring me down, I pray
Oh, pretty baby

01:04:24.902 --> 01:04:30.115
Now that I found you, stay
and let me love you, baby

01:04:30.241 --> 01:04:35.036
Let me love you

01:05:20.625 --> 01:05:22.751
You look pretty nervous.

01:05:23.628 --> 01:05:25.337
Yes, sir.

01:05:25.463 --> 01:05:27.505
You're sweating like a pig.

01:05:28.341 --> 01:05:29.674
Yes, sir.

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:32.177
Your eyes are all bloodshot.

01:05:33.763 --> 01:05:34.846
Yes, sir.

01:05:34.972 --> 01:05:37.349
You've got pot, don't you?

01:05:43.522 --> 01:05:45.523
I'm confiscating this.

01:05:55.034 --> 01:05:56.451
This, too.

01:06:01.207 --> 01:06:03.959
Mr Chapin, can I talk to you
for a second?

01:06:04.043 --> 01:06:05.627
What can I do for you, Stratford?

01:06:05.711 --> 01:06:08.630
I have some ideas on how
we can improve the girls' soccer team.

01:06:08.714 --> 01:06:11.049
Great! Let's talk about it later.

01:06:13.719 --> 01:06:18.139
The window.

01:06:20.893 --> 01:06:23.561
As you know, we have
a really big game with Hillcrest High...

01:06:23.646 --> 01:06:25.146
Your bicep is huge!

01:06:25.231 --> 01:06:27.899
Oh, my God.
The other one's even bigger.

01:06:28.234 --> 01:06:30.568
You don't take steroids, do you,
because I've heard steroids

01:06:30.695 --> 01:06:33.238
can severely disintegrate
your package?

01:06:34.407 --> 01:06:36.157
Not that I'm thinking about
your package.

01:06:36.242 --> 01:06:38.368
- That's not the point.
- Let's hope not.

01:06:39.537 --> 01:06:42.163
The point is they kick our butts
every year.

01:06:42.248 --> 01:06:46.876
I was thinking, I devised a plan that
will enable us to finally defeat them.

01:06:47.003 --> 01:06:48.420
Which is?

01:06:48.838 --> 01:06:51.756
- That thing that you taught us.
- What thing?

01:06:52.091 --> 01:06:54.092
- Misdirection.
- I taught you that?

01:06:54.176 --> 01:06:57.929
Yeah, you or Siegfried or Roy?
Anyway, that's not important.

01:06:59.098 --> 01:07:00.682
The... Think about it.

01:07:00.766 --> 01:07:03.435
They're looking left
and we're running right.

01:07:03.561 --> 01:07:05.603
Bang, we score. We win.

01:07:06.439 --> 01:07:08.440
Okay, but how do we get 'em
to look left?

01:07:10.276 --> 01:07:11.776
Like this.

01:07:19.285 --> 01:07:21.619
Okay. Well,

01:07:22.913 --> 01:07:25.290
now that you've seen "the plan,"

01:07:25.583 --> 01:07:29.878
I'm gonna go and show "the plan"
to someone else.

01:07:31.922 --> 01:07:33.048
Okay.

01:07:33.799 --> 01:07:34.924
Hi.

01:07:43.642 --> 01:07:46.144
I can't thank you enough
for helping me sneak out of detention.

01:07:46.270 --> 01:07:48.146
- Very cool.
- No problem.

01:07:48.314 --> 01:07:51.483
I thought for sure I was busted when I
was climbing out that window, I tell ya.

01:07:51.567 --> 01:07:53.902
So, how did you keep him distracted?

01:07:53.986 --> 01:07:56.738
I dazzled him with my wits.

01:08:00.451 --> 01:08:02.827
- So, what's your excuse?
- For?

01:08:03.162 --> 01:08:05.121
For acting the way we do?

01:08:06.165 --> 01:08:08.416
I don't like to do what people expect.

01:08:08.501 --> 01:08:11.669
Why should I live up to other people's
expectations instead of my own?

01:08:11.796 --> 01:08:15.090
So, you disappoint 'em from the start
and then you're covered, right?

01:08:16.341 --> 01:08:18.343
Something like that.

01:08:19.678 --> 01:08:22.180
- Then you screwed up.
- How?

01:08:23.974 --> 01:08:26.017
You never disappointed me.

01:08:34.819 --> 01:08:36.361
Are you up for it?

01:08:37.029 --> 01:08:38.529
Up for what?

01:10:01.739 --> 01:10:03.364
All right, come on.

01:10:18.464 --> 01:10:20.465
No, none of that stuff is true.

01:10:20.591 --> 01:10:23.968
- State trooper.
- Fallacy. Dead guy in the parking lot?

01:10:24.094 --> 01:10:25.970
Rumour. The duck?

01:10:26.055 --> 01:10:28.306
Hearsay. Bobby Ridgeway's balls?

01:10:28.641 --> 01:10:31.142
Fact. But he deserved it.
He tried to grope me in the lunch line.

01:10:31.268 --> 01:10:33.269
- Fair enough.
- The accent?

01:10:33.646 --> 01:10:37.148
It's real.
I lived in Australia until I was 10.

01:10:37.483 --> 01:10:40.276
- With the Pygmies?
- Close.

01:10:40.486 --> 01:10:41.986
With my mom.

01:10:43.656 --> 01:10:46.824
Where were you last year?
I know the porn career is a lie.

01:10:46.909 --> 01:10:48.243
Do you?

01:10:56.502 --> 01:10:59.295
- Tell me something true.
- Something true.

01:11:02.341 --> 01:11:03.800
I hate peas.

01:11:04.343 --> 01:11:07.929
No. Something real.
Something no one else knows.

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:10.515
Okay. You're sweet,

01:11:13.185 --> 01:11:14.686
and sexy,

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:18.523
and completely hot for me.

01:11:20.192 --> 01:11:22.944
You are amazingly self-assured.
Has anyone ever told you that?

01:11:23.028 --> 01:11:25.863
I tell myself that every day, actually.

01:11:28.993 --> 01:11:32.787
- Go to the prom with me.
- Is that a request or a command?

01:11:32.871 --> 01:11:35.039
Come on. Go with me.

01:11:35.541 --> 01:11:38.543
- No.
- No? Why not?

01:11:39.044 --> 01:11:41.045
Because I don't want to.
Because it's a stupid tradition.

01:11:41.171 --> 01:11:43.881
Come on.
People won't expect you to go.

01:11:44.717 --> 01:11:46.843
Why are you pushing this?

01:11:49.221 --> 01:11:51.014
What's in it for you?

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:58.146
So now I need to have a motive
to want to be with you?

01:11:58.230 --> 01:11:59.731
You tell me.

01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:03.234
You need therapy, you know that?

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:05.862
Has anyone ever told you that?

01:12:06.697 --> 01:12:08.573
- Answer the question, Patrick.
- Nothing!

01:12:08.657 --> 01:12:09.657
There is nothing in it for me,

01:12:09.742 --> 01:12:12.327
just the pleasure of your company.
Okay?

01:12:37.227 --> 01:12:40.188
Wait. Wait a minute.
That... That's not on this page.

01:13:19.770 --> 01:13:20.978
Seven!

01:13:23.982 --> 01:13:25.149
Good.

01:13:29.488 --> 01:13:31.781
- Daddy?
- Hi, honey.

01:13:32.324 --> 01:13:37.078
I'd like to discuss tomorrow night
with you. As you know, it's the prom...

01:13:42.918 --> 01:13:45.336
The prom? Kat has a date?

01:13:46.171 --> 01:13:47.672
Well, no.

01:13:49.007 --> 01:13:50.091
Don't think you're fooling me.

01:13:50.175 --> 01:13:51.509
I know who you wanna
bend the rules for.

01:13:51.593 --> 01:13:53.511
It's that hot-rod Joey.

01:13:53.595 --> 01:13:55.263
What's a hot rod?

01:13:56.014 --> 01:14:00.435
It's a... If your sister's not going,
you're not going. End of story.

01:14:01.437 --> 01:14:03.187
Okay, let's review.

01:14:03.313 --> 01:14:06.357
Kat, not interested, me, dying to go.

01:14:06.608 --> 01:14:08.693
Do you know what happens at proms?

01:14:08.777 --> 01:14:11.529
Yes, Daddy. We'll dance,
we'll kiss, we'll come home.

01:14:11.613 --> 01:14:14.115
It's not quite the crisis situation
you imagine.

01:14:14.199 --> 01:14:16.284
Kissing, huh?
That's what you think happens?

01:14:16.368 --> 01:14:17.452
Got news for you.

01:14:17.536 --> 01:14:22.039
Kissing isn't what keeps me up to
my elbows in placenta all day long.

01:14:22.541 --> 01:14:25.460
Can we for two seconds ignore the fact
that you're severely unhinged,

01:14:25.544 --> 01:14:28.045
and discuss my need for a night
of teenage normalcy?

01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:31.215
What's normal?
Those damn Dawson's River kids,

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:34.051
sleeping in each other's beds
and whatnot?

01:14:34.636 --> 01:14:36.804
- Daddy, that is so not...
- Got news for ya.

01:14:36.889 --> 01:14:38.556
I'm down. I've got the 4-1-1.

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:40.975
And you are not going out
and getting jiggy with some boy.

01:14:41.059 --> 01:14:43.561
I don't care how dope his ride is.

01:14:48.567 --> 01:14:50.985
My mama didn't raise no fool.

01:14:52.404 --> 01:14:53.905
Thanks, Bill.

01:14:55.657 --> 01:14:58.576
Ridiculous amounts of love
across this nation worldwide.

01:14:59.203 --> 01:15:00.411
Believe it.

01:15:01.747 --> 01:15:03.664
This is the true story.

01:15:04.917 --> 01:15:06.000
Seattle.

01:15:08.921 --> 01:15:10.338
Come in.

01:15:16.595 --> 01:15:18.262
Listen, I know...

01:15:21.266 --> 01:15:24.435
I know you hate having to sit at home
because I'm not Suzy High School.

01:15:24.561 --> 01:15:26.771
- Like you care.
- I do care.

01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:30.608
But I'm a firm believer in doing
something for your own reasons,

01:15:30.692 --> 01:15:32.693
and not someone else's.

01:15:33.612 --> 01:15:35.613
Well, I wish I had that luxury.

01:15:35.697 --> 01:15:38.449
You know, I'm the only sophomore
that got asked to go to the prom,

01:15:38.534 --> 01:15:41.452
and I can't go
because you don't feel like it.

01:15:45.457 --> 01:15:48.709
Joey never told you
that we went out, did he?

01:15:48.794 --> 01:15:52.296
- Yeah, okay.
- In ninth, for a month.

01:15:58.971 --> 01:16:02.265
- Why?
- Because he was, like, such a babe.

01:16:03.308 --> 01:16:06.102
- But you hate Joey.
- Now I do.

01:16:06.979 --> 01:16:08.479
So, what happened?

01:16:15.821 --> 01:16:17.738
Please tell me you're joking.

01:16:17.823 --> 01:16:21.242
Just once, right after Mom left.

01:16:22.494 --> 01:16:24.912
Everyone was doing it, so...

01:16:24.997 --> 01:16:26.330
I did it.

01:16:27.332 --> 01:16:30.668
Afterwards I told him I didn't want to
any more because I wasn't ready,

01:16:30.794 --> 01:16:33.296
and he got pissed and he dumped me.

01:16:34.506 --> 01:16:36.340
After that I swore I'd never do anything

01:16:36.425 --> 01:16:38.259
just because everyone else
was doing it.

01:16:38.343 --> 01:16:40.011
And I haven't since,

01:16:40.637 --> 01:16:42.263
with the exception of Bogey's party

01:16:42.347 --> 01:16:44.974
and my stunning
digestive pyrotechnics.

01:16:47.185 --> 01:16:50.354
How is it possible
that I did not know about this?

01:16:50.856 --> 01:16:52.273
I warned him that if he told anyone,

01:16:52.357 --> 01:16:56.027
the cheerleading squad would find out
how tiny his dick is.

01:16:58.864 --> 01:17:01.699
Okay, so why didn't you tell me?

01:17:03.535 --> 01:17:06.621
I wanted to let you
make up your mind about him.

01:17:07.873 --> 01:17:10.833
Then why did you help Daddy
hold me hostage?

01:17:11.209 --> 01:17:14.545
It's not like I'm stupid enough
to repeat your mistakes.

01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:16.547
I guess I thought I was protecting you.

01:17:16.673 --> 01:17:19.634
By not letting me experience
anything for myself?

01:17:19.718 --> 01:17:22.386
Not all experiences are good, Bianca.

01:17:22.471 --> 01:17:24.472
You can't always trust
the people you want to.

01:17:24.556 --> 01:17:27.141
Well, I guess I'll never know, will I?

01:18:12.270 --> 01:18:14.021
Ladies with thinning hair or bald spots,

01:18:14.106 --> 01:18:18.609
G.L.H. solves the problem instantly.
G.L.H. Is not a paint or a cover-up.

01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:22.780
It's an amazing powder that clings
to the tiniest hairs on your head.

01:18:23.115 --> 01:18:24.949
It actually builds on itself,

01:18:25.033 --> 01:18:27.618
leaving you with great,
great-looking hair.

01:18:27.744 --> 01:18:29.370
And the G.L.H. Hair system
is not expensive.

01:18:29.454 --> 01:18:30.538
Interesting.

01:18:30.622 --> 01:18:33.040
Order your G.L.H. Hair package now.

01:18:33.792 --> 01:18:36.043
Bye, Dad. I'm going to the prom.

01:18:36.586 --> 01:18:37.795
Funny, sweetie.

01:18:38.255 --> 01:18:41.215
It instantly covers your bald spot
leaving you with great looking hair.

01:18:45.762 --> 01:18:47.888
- What's that?
- A prom dress.

01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:50.766
I seem to be hearing that word
a lot lately.

01:18:55.981 --> 01:18:59.150
- Hi.
- Wow. I...

01:19:02.904 --> 01:19:04.447
Wow.

01:19:05.073 --> 01:19:06.907
- Bye, Daddy.
- Stop.

01:19:06.992 --> 01:19:09.785
Turn. Explain.

01:19:11.163 --> 01:19:14.498
Okay. Remember how you said
I could date if Kat dated?

01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:16.834
Well, she found this guy
who's actually kind of perfect for her

01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:18.335
which is perfect for me,

01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:21.255
because Cameron asked me to go to
the prom and I really, really wanna go,

01:19:21.339 --> 01:19:24.508
and since Kat went, I guess I'm allowed
to, based on the aforementioned rule,

01:19:24.634 --> 01:19:26.677
and its previous stipulations, of course.

01:19:27.512 --> 01:19:29.430
- Nice to meet you.
- Let's go.

01:19:33.185 --> 01:19:34.769
I know every cop in town, bucko!

01:19:38.857 --> 01:19:40.608
This is not good.

01:20:22.234 --> 01:20:23.400
Wow.

01:20:24.903 --> 01:20:26.237
You, too.

01:20:29.324 --> 01:20:30.908
Where'd you get a tux
at the last minute?

01:20:30.992 --> 01:20:34.161
Oh, just something I had,
you know, lying around.

01:20:34.538 --> 01:20:35.746
Where'd you get the dress?

01:20:35.872 --> 01:20:38.415
Oh, just something I had,
you know, lying around.

01:20:42.003 --> 01:20:45.840
Listen, I'm really sorry
that I questioned your motives.

01:20:46.424 --> 01:20:48.050
I was wrong.

01:20:49.928 --> 01:20:51.595
You're forgiven.

01:20:54.391 --> 01:20:55.558
Okay.

01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:58.936
- Ready for the prom?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:21:12.617 --> 01:21:16.287
Hi, Mr Stratford. I'm Joey.
I'm here to pick up Bianca.

01:21:37.475 --> 01:21:39.143
- Have you seen him?
- Who?

01:21:39.269 --> 01:21:41.937
William.
He asked me to meet him here.

01:21:42.814 --> 01:21:44.565
Oh, Mandella,
please tell me you haven't

01:21:44.649 --> 01:21:47.276
progressed to full-on hallucinations.

01:22:09.925 --> 01:22:12.259
- Milady.
- Good sir.

01:22:36.826 --> 01:22:38.535
Oh, my God, it's...

01:22:40.288 --> 01:22:42.206
I called in a favour!

01:23:39.597 --> 01:23:41.098
What are you doing here?

01:23:41.224 --> 01:23:43.684
I know you didn't think you were
the only sophomore at the prom.

01:23:43.768 --> 01:23:45.561
Joey just picked me up.

01:23:45.645 --> 01:23:48.689
Oh, well, congratulations.
He's all yours.

01:23:48.773 --> 01:23:50.399
Very generous, princess.

01:23:50.483 --> 01:23:53.694
And just so you know,
Joey only liked you for one reason.

01:23:53.778 --> 01:23:55.654
He even had a bet going
with his friends.

01:23:55.780 --> 01:23:57.948
He was gonna nail you tonight.

01:24:02.954 --> 01:24:05.164
- Milwaukee.
- What?

01:24:05.415 --> 01:24:08.459
That's where I was last year.
I wasn't in jail.

01:24:08.626 --> 01:24:09.877
I don't know Marilyn Manson

01:24:09.961 --> 01:24:13.589
and I didn't sleep with a Spice Girl,
I don't think.

01:24:13.757 --> 01:24:17.468
You see, my grandpa, he was ill
so I spent most of the year on his couch

01:24:17.594 --> 01:24:20.846
watching Wheel ofFortune
and making SpaghettiOs.

01:24:21.598 --> 01:24:23.098
End of story.

01:24:23.683 --> 01:24:25.017
No way.

01:24:27.270 --> 01:24:31.106
Hey. What's Bianca doing here
with that cheese dick?

01:24:31.316 --> 01:24:36.153
I didn't pay you to take out Kat so some
little punk could snake me with Bianca.

01:24:40.158 --> 01:24:42.284
Nothing in it for you, huh?

01:24:53.671 --> 01:24:55.798
The shit hath hitteth

01:24:55.882 --> 01:24:58.008
the faneth.

01:25:01.846 --> 01:25:04.973
Joey, pal, compadre?

01:25:08.019 --> 01:25:11.271
You messed with the wrong guy,
and now you're gonna pay.

01:25:11.356 --> 01:25:13.982
You and that little bitch.

01:25:14.734 --> 01:25:18.195
All right, that's enough, okay!
You crossed the line.

01:25:20.365 --> 01:25:22.533
Oh, come on! Get up, you little punk!

01:25:27.664 --> 01:25:30.874
Shit, Bianca!
I'm shooting a nose spray ad tomorrow!

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.419
That's for making my date bleed!
That's for my sister!

01:25:35.547 --> 01:25:37.256
And that's for me.

01:25:44.848 --> 01:25:46.348
Are you okay?

01:25:47.350 --> 01:25:49.059
Never been better.

01:25:58.194 --> 01:25:59.236
Would you give me a chance...

01:25:59.362 --> 01:26:02.406
You were paid to take me out
by the one person I truly hate.

01:26:02.532 --> 01:26:04.533
I knew this was a set-up!

01:26:04.701 --> 01:26:07.035
Kat, it wasn't like that, okay.

01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:09.788
What was it like, a down payment now
and a bonus for sleeping with me?

01:26:09.914 --> 01:26:12.875
No, I didn't care about the money!
I cared...

01:26:13.710 --> 01:26:15.544
I cared about you.

01:26:17.088 --> 01:26:19.756
You are so not who I thought you were.

01:27:02.675 --> 01:27:04.426
You want?

01:27:04.636 --> 01:27:05.844
Thanks.

01:27:07.138 --> 01:27:11.141
So, you sure you don't want
to go sailing with us? It'll be fun.

01:27:11.601 --> 01:27:13.477
No, I'm fine.

01:27:14.854 --> 01:27:18.982
Look, I don't know if I ever thanked you
for going last night,

01:27:20.318 --> 01:27:22.653
but it really meant a lot to me.

01:27:24.948 --> 01:27:26.281
I'm glad.

01:27:28.368 --> 01:27:30.619
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:27:30.828 --> 01:27:32.621
You ready?

01:27:34.207 --> 01:27:35.958
- See you later.
- Bye.

01:27:37.961 --> 01:27:40.462
- Is... Is she okay?
- I hope so.

01:27:47.470 --> 01:27:49.346
Where's your sister going?

01:27:49.555 --> 01:27:53.308
She's meeting some bikers,
big ones, full of sperm.

01:27:55.228 --> 01:27:56.478
Funny.

01:27:58.564 --> 01:28:01.483
So, tell me about this dance.
Was it hoppin'?

01:28:02.568 --> 01:28:03.777
Parts of it.

01:28:03.861 --> 01:28:05.153
Which parts?

01:28:05.989 --> 01:28:08.949
The part where Bianca
beat the hell out of some guy.

01:28:09.033 --> 01:28:10.450
Bianca did what?

01:28:10.535 --> 01:28:13.745
What's the matter,
upset that I rubbed off on her?

01:28:14.539 --> 01:28:16.039
No, impressed.

01:28:20.670 --> 01:28:22.629
Fathers don't like to admit it
when their daughters

01:28:22.714 --> 01:28:24.006
are capable of running their own lives.

01:28:24.090 --> 01:28:26.591
It means we've become spectators.

01:28:30.430 --> 01:28:35.183
Bianca still lets me play a few innings.
You've had me on the bench for years.

01:28:37.562 --> 01:28:40.939
And when you go to Sarah Lawrence,
I won't even be able to watch the game.

01:28:43.234 --> 01:28:44.735
When I go?

01:28:45.903 --> 01:28:48.905
Oh, boy. Don't tell me
you changed your mind.

01:28:49.907 --> 01:28:52.075
I already sent 'em a cheque.

01:29:09.135 --> 01:29:12.679
All right, I assume everyone
has found time to complete their poem,

01:29:12.764 --> 01:29:14.598
except for Mr Donner,

01:29:15.099 --> 01:29:16.767
who has an excuse.

01:29:18.811 --> 01:29:20.937
Shaft, lose the glasses.

01:29:24.817 --> 01:29:28.153
All right, anyone brave enough
to read theirs aloud?

01:29:36.621 --> 01:29:37.829
I will.

01:29:40.291 --> 01:29:41.792
Lord, here we go.

01:29:50.676 --> 01:29:54.054
"I hate the way you talk to me
and the way you cut your hair

01:29:54.138 --> 01:29:58.558
"I hate the way you drive my car
I hate it when you stare

01:29:58.643 --> 01:30:02.521
"I hate your big dumb combat boots
and the way you read my mind

01:30:02.647 --> 01:30:06.316
"I hate you so much it makes me sick
It even makes me rhyme

01:30:08.611 --> 01:30:11.571
"I hate it...
I hate the way you're always right

01:30:11.656 --> 01:30:13.782
"I hate it when you lie

01:30:13.866 --> 01:30:17.953
"I hate it when you make me laugh
even worse when you make me cry

01:30:19.497 --> 01:30:23.583
"I hate it when you're not around
and the fact that you didn't call

01:30:23.668 --> 01:30:27.337
"But mostly, I hate the way
I don't hate you, not even close

01:30:27.463 --> 01:30:30.048
"not even a little bit, not even at all"

01:31:12.842 --> 01:31:16.261
- Nice, huh?
- A Fender Strat?

01:31:16.888 --> 01:31:18.305
Is it for me?

01:31:18.389 --> 01:31:22.142
Yeah, I thought you could use it,
you know, when you start your band.

01:31:22.226 --> 01:31:24.936
Besides,
I had some extra cash, you know.

01:31:25.062 --> 01:31:28.523
Some asshole paid me
to take out this really great girl.

01:31:29.775 --> 01:31:31.526
Is that right?

01:31:32.069 --> 01:31:35.530
Yeah, but I screwed up. I... I fell for her.

01:31:38.117 --> 01:31:39.409
Really?

01:31:40.953 --> 01:31:42.204
It's not every day you find a girl

01:31:42.288 --> 01:31:45.582
who'll flash someone
to get you out of detention.

01:31:46.417 --> 01:31:47.626
Oh, God.

01:31:55.927 --> 01:31:59.638
You can't just buy me a guitar
every time you screw up, you know.

01:32:00.056 --> 01:32:01.473
Yeah, I know.

01:32:02.433 --> 01:32:06.144
But there's always drums and bass
and maybe even one day a tambourine.

01:32:14.153 --> 01:32:15.278
And don't just think you can...

01:34:46.597 --> 01:34:51.059
No offence. I know everyone "digs"
your sister and all,

01:34:51.268 --> 01:34:52.811
but she's without.

01:34:54.772 --> 01:34:58.733
You know, you're not as vile
as I thought you were.

01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:10.620
You suck.

01:35:10.830 --> 01:35:14.416
Okay. Let's go!

01:35:16.335 --> 01:35:18.336
You're just messin' with me,
aren't you?

01:35:18.462 --> 01:35:20.505
No, I'm really looking forward
to doing it.

01:35:20.631 --> 01:35:21.881
Go see Miss Perky.

01:35:21.966 --> 01:35:24.634
- What?
- Go. Perky's. Go, now.

01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:27.637
Once again.
"Perky, now" is the second one.

01:35:27.763 --> 01:35:30.515
- Perky's now. Perky's, now.
- Right away.

01:35:30.641 --> 01:35:32.350
- Now, Perky's.
- Hey, hey.

01:35:32.476 --> 01:35:35.228
- Now, Perky's. Perky's now.
- At the beginning of the shot.

01:35:35.312 --> 01:35:36.688
Perk...

01:35:40.276 --> 01:35:43.528
Bianca, let's go. We're all
congregating around Mr Cuervo.

01:35:44.989 --> 01:35:47.031
I'll see you around, okay?

01:35:57.460 --> 01:36:00.211
Don't worry. There's better for you,

01:36:00.379 --> 01:36:02.172
and it's right here.

01:36:02.715 --> 01:36:05.049
Come here.
No, I wanted you for so long.

01:36:07.636 --> 01:36:10.889
You messed with the wrong guy,
and now you're gonna pay.

01:36:11.015 --> 01:36:13.308
You and that little bitch.

01:36:14.477 --> 01:36:18.062
All right, that's enough, okay!
You crossed the line.

01:36:23.152 --> 01:36:24.402
What, are you kidding me?

01:36:30.367 --> 01:36:33.578
- I'm driving, so I pick the tunes.
- And it's my car.

01:36:36.874 --> 01:36:39.417
I want some coffee!

01:36:52.431 --> 01:36:55.266
Could I get a prophylactic?

01:36:55.434 --> 01:36:57.227
A prophylactic.

01:36:59.522 --> 01:37:02.482
- Let go!
- How could you set me up like that?

01:37:02.566 --> 01:37:04.400
Oh, God, I just wanted...

01:37:04.527 --> 01:37:06.528
To completely damage me,
send me to therapy forever?

01:37:06.612 --> 01:37:09.030
- No, I just wanted...
- Ladies.

01:37:11.909 --> 01:37:13.743
Shall we go to my office?

01:37:16.539 --> 01:37:18.581
Oh, my God!

01:37:19.305 --> 01:37:25.837
