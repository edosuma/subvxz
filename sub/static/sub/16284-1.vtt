against the savages.

As soon as the ships
are armed, I set sail...

But he wasn't lying.
The parchment bore the king's seal.

29:32.160 --> 29:36.392
What? Then your king's promise
to meet me was the lie.

- A king doesn't lie!
- They cannot both be true.

bring the Indian chief--

with the chief and no one less.

- Sire, I gave these people
your word you would meet.

- Are we not honour-bound--
- [ Ratcliffe ]
The king is bound to nothing,

32:26.120 --> 32:27.917
when you cannot
fulfill your mission.

32:28.040 --> 32:31.715
You were sent for the savage leader
and yet you bring back a woman.

32:31.840 --> 32:36.118
- A woman!
- Your Highness,
she is royalty-- a princess.

32:36.240 --> 32:38.879
She is the daughter of a great chief
who has travelled...

32:39.000 --> 32:41.798
far from her homeland
in the interests of peace.

32:41.920 --> 32:43.831
Meet with her, Your Majesty.

32:43.960 --> 32:46.269
May I suggest she attend
the hunt ball?

32:46.400 --> 32:48.868
Let her go back to Virginia
having witnessed...

32:49.000 --> 32:53.039
the royal might and majesty
of English society.

32:53.160 --> 32:55.913
Sire, she doesn't know
our customs.

32:56.040 --> 32:59.874
- To subject her to this kind
of scrutiny would be--
- I don't understand, Rolfe.

33:00.000 --> 33:03.276
If she's not a savage,
then why shouldn't she fit in?

33:03.400 --> 33:08.713
Excellent idea, Ratcliffe. Rolfe,
you will bring her to the hunt ball.

33:08.840 --> 33:12.355
Prove to me she is as civilized
as you claim, and...

33:12.480 --> 33:16.109
I will stop my armada;
if not, the armada sails.

- It is decided!

33:42.880 --> 33:45.838
You were successful?
When do I see the king?

- You're now invited to the hunt ball.
- I don't understand.

33:51.640 --> 33:55.235
Oh, it's a trap!
Ratcliffe manipulated the king!

33:55.360 --> 33:58.352
He's saying that if you're
civilized you can fit right in.

33:58.480 --> 34:02.155
But it's the elite of British society--
etiquette and manners.

34:02.280 --> 34:05.397
There's a million ways you can insult
someone. Believe me, I know.

34:05.520 --> 34:08.353
And if you slip up, just once,
Ratcliffe can convince the king that--

34:08.480 --> 34:11.233
Then I must not "slip up."

34:11.360 --> 34:15.478
I can't learn your ways alone,
but you can help me.

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:35.670
 Miles and miles 

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:39.156
 Away 

01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:41.999
 Though the journey
takes us far 

01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:47.672
 Our love has found
a place to stay 

01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:51.395
-  lf we believe 
-  lf we believe 

01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:55.115
-  There is no sea 
-  There is no sea 

01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:57.117
 That's wide enough 

01:06:57.240 --> 01:07:02.030
 To keep us from our destiny 

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:06.996
 Like the snows
of every winter melt 

01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:10.829
 And blossom into spring 

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:14.475
 As the seasons pass
we'll live as one 

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:18.115
 No matter what
the years ahead 

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:22.074
 May bring 

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:25.590
 No night is long enough 

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:29.395
 To end this light
that shines on us 

01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:32.239
 We have built
a bridge of love 

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:36.956
 Between two worlds 

01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:40.834
 Yes, we have built a love 

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:48.435
 Between two worlds 

01:07:49.305 --> 01:07:55.657
