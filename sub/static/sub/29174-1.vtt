00:24.558 --> 00:26.025
Sometimes
when the soul

00:26.027 --> 00:28.327
is too broken or confused,

00:28.329 --> 00:31.397
it becomes a target of
the fundamental darkness,

00:31.399 --> 00:34.033
the innate devil
force of the universe.

00:37.438 --> 00:39.304
The soul is given
a diluted power

00:39.306 --> 00:42.307
and identity until the
advent of its downfall.

00:46.313 --> 00:48.580
This downfall is
brought by Taven,

00:48.582 --> 00:51.583
the warden of this dark world.

00:51.585 --> 00:54.620
There is no right or wrong
in the eyes of Taven,

00:54.622 --> 00:56.655
only consequences.

00:56.657 --> 00:58.323
This is the battle of the evil

00:58.325 --> 01:00.726
versus the darkness.

01:49.310 --> 01:51.110
Holly, Holly?

01:51.679 --> 01:52.679
Come here baby.

01:55.249 --> 01:56.181
Come here.

01:56.183 --> 01:57.816
Come here, come here.

02:00.154 --> 02:01.154
Yeah.

02:54.441 --> 02:55.641
We found him again.

02:56.477 --> 02:58.911
So he finally arrived?

02:58.913 --> 03:00.379
Yes.

03:00.381 --> 03:02.247
It took a lot of work,

03:02.249 --> 03:03.815
but sources have confirmed.

03:04.652 --> 03:06.285
He's active in our area.

03:07.521 --> 03:08.854
What can I do?

03:13.794 --> 03:15.427
You are the chosen one.

03:16.330 --> 03:17.696
I am?

03:17.698 --> 03:18.698
Yes.

03:22.903 --> 03:25.771
Are you sure they
made the right decision?

03:25.773 --> 03:28.240
Never doubt the
decision of the COJ.

03:28.842 --> 03:30.342
I know you're ready.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.133
Don't worry.

03:38.134 --> 03:39.550
We'll be staying close by.

03:44.325 --> 03:45.324
Here,

03:45.326 --> 03:48.694
I now bestow you
the symbol of honor.

03:49.930 --> 03:52.331
You're now officially Taven.

04:59.933 --> 05:03.035
So, you are the chosen one.

05:05.539 --> 05:06.539
Yes.

05:08.342 --> 05:10.842
Do you know what
you're up against?

05:13.314 --> 05:14.479
Please, guide me.

05:16.717 --> 05:18.750
The fundamental darkness

05:18.752 --> 05:20.919
is what you're fighting against.

05:23.057 --> 05:24.456
What does that mean?

05:25.859 --> 05:29.628
Call upon the ultimate
evil to counter it.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.466
The ultimate

05:34.468 --> 05:35.468
evil?

05:37.771 --> 05:38.771
Me.

05:40.341 --> 05:41.673
It is what's called

05:41.675 --> 05:43.942
turn poison into medicine.

07:07.861 --> 07:10.195
What's left in you?

07:10.197 --> 07:12.030
Only Taven.

07:12.032 --> 07:14.766
Why wouldn't you
stop this evil cycle?

07:14.768 --> 07:16.701
Everything needs a balance.

07:16.703 --> 07:19.604
Without the evil,
what's the good?

07:20.774 --> 07:22.374
It's an easy excuse

07:22.375 --> 07:23.975
for avoiding
challenging yourself.

07:23.977 --> 07:26.077
No, it's not an excuse,

07:26.079 --> 07:28.713
when you can realize
how much power you have.

07:30.017 --> 07:32.751
No, it's not your power.

07:32.753 --> 07:34.920
It's an illusion, lent to you.

07:34.922 --> 07:35.922
Really?

07:37.724 --> 07:39.090
Try this, then.

08:44.258 --> 08:47.158
Let me show you
the essence of Taven.

09:14.087 --> 09:15.854
You stopped fighting.

09:15.856 --> 09:16.856
Why?

09:18.058 --> 09:19.558
To protect someone,

09:21.728 --> 09:26.231
and passion.

09:28.001 --> 09:29.701
I will keep coming back.

09:48.288 --> 09:51.189
Rose, are you okay?

09:51.191 --> 09:52.857
Something is not right.

09:55.596 --> 09:57.629
I feel a much more
powerful force

09:58.265 --> 09:59.998
than the source has indicated.

10:02.269 --> 10:03.835
I'm worried about Romona.

10:04.671 --> 10:06.605
A more powerful force?

10:07.808 --> 10:09.741
How is that possible?

10:12.245 --> 10:14.212
There is something
foreign in him.

10:15.983 --> 10:18.650
A borrowed energy
to boost himself.

10:19.753 --> 10:20.952
A borrowed energy.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.222
You can borrow and
transfer factions

10:25.192 --> 10:27.359
into actual energy
in the form of force.

11:00.961 --> 11:01.961
Chloe?

11:03.230 --> 11:04.396
Hey, Ian.

11:04.398 --> 11:06.831
Just come back from work?

11:06.833 --> 11:09.334
I thought you were
practicing with your friend?

11:14.341 --> 11:15.807
I was about to leave.

11:17.110 --> 11:19.127
So how was teaching?

11:19.128 --> 11:21.145
It was fine, just a
couple of new students.

11:22.115 --> 11:24.215
Hey, you're drinking
my juice again.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.353
Here, have some juice,

11:29.122 --> 11:30.789
and get some rest.

11:30.791 --> 11:31.791
Yeah, I should.

11:55.415 --> 11:56.415
What?

12:05.859 --> 12:07.258
Why?

12:07.260 --> 12:08.893
That guy is poor.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.428
We're going to die anyway.

12:10.430 --> 12:12.297
Let's get out of here
and get some drinks.

12:31.284 --> 12:32.284
Okay.

12:40.527 --> 12:41.527
Hey.

13:17.063 --> 13:19.230
Why wasting efforts

13:20.267 --> 13:22.100
protecting those?

13:24.938 --> 13:26.104
Speak!

13:29.576 --> 13:31.342
They're like my family.

13:32.813 --> 13:35.213
They accept me for who I am.

13:36.316 --> 13:39.217
But they may not
even appreciate you.

13:40.253 --> 13:41.352
It's okay.

13:42.422 --> 13:43.488
I don't mind.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.091
Follow me,

13:47.894 --> 13:49.160
and I'll spare you.

13:52.199 --> 13:53.199
No.

13:54.568 --> 13:56.000
You are the devil.

13:59.005 --> 14:01.339
What do you
expect from me then?

14:05.245 --> 14:07.011
If I put up a good fight,

14:08.949 --> 14:10.315
spare my friends.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.226
It won't be easy.

15:15.048 --> 15:16.915
It's not time yet.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.117
Are you quitting?

15:36.136 --> 15:37.136
Any more?

16:30.256 --> 16:31.389
Hate me or fear me,

16:33.360 --> 16:35.226
you'll feel better.

17:25.578 --> 17:28.378
Something different about
the way you played tonight.

17:32.519 --> 17:37.321
So when will you agree to
record an album together?

17:37.323 --> 17:38.323
I don't know.

17:40.493 --> 17:42.060
It feels like you're
under surveillance

17:42.062 --> 17:44.595
when you're playing for
a recording machine.

17:46.366 --> 17:48.499
Knowing you all these years,

17:48.501 --> 17:51.602
this is the weirdest
thing about you.

18:21.835 --> 18:24.769
Do you have
anything that I can

18:25.772 --> 18:26.772
wipe this?

18:36.783 --> 18:37.782
Dammit, where's my...

18:37.784 --> 18:39.517
What about this?

19:29.302 --> 19:30.568
Who are you?

19:31.437 --> 19:33.571
I just wanted to observe you

19:33.573 --> 19:35.273
before I speak to you.

19:36.576 --> 19:37.708
Hi, my name is Rose.

19:39.445 --> 19:40.411
I'm Ian.

19:40.413 --> 19:44.182
Ian, what I'm
about to tell you

19:44.184 --> 19:45.750
might sound a little crazy,

19:45.752 --> 19:47.852
but it's definitely the truth.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.320
Wait a minute.

19:49.322 --> 19:50.322
Okay.

19:51.925 --> 19:53.624
You're the chosen one, Ian.

20:05.605 --> 20:07.205
Am I on TV?

20:07.907 --> 20:09.473
I'm on TV, right?

20:09.475 --> 20:10.475
Am I?

20:11.444 --> 20:13.111
No, you're not.

20:13.112 --> 20:14.779
You have been chosen
as the new Taven

20:14.781 --> 20:16.380
to counter the manifestation

20:16.382 --> 20:18.382
of the fundamental darkness.

20:19.485 --> 20:22.920
I'm sorry.

20:22.922 --> 20:24.288
Rose, right?

20:24.290 --> 20:27.892
I don't know what
you're talking about.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.594
I understand your response,

20:29.596 --> 20:32.396
but this is dead serious.

20:32.398 --> 20:35.499
I want you to help us
fight against Viro.

20:35.501 --> 20:36.634
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:36.636 --> 20:38.603
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

20:38.604 --> 20:40.571
I think you're talking
to the wrong guy.

20:40.573 --> 20:43.307
All right, I'm a musician, okay?

20:43.309 --> 20:44.442
You will be,

20:44.444 --> 20:45.977
if you allow me to bestow to you

20:45.979 --> 20:47.311
the essence of Taven.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.614
No thanks.

20:49.616 --> 20:53.684
If you'll excuse me, I
have to go now, okay?

20:53.686 --> 20:55.253
Best luck to you, Rose.

20:58.324 --> 20:59.924
You will
be tested, Ian.

21:30.857 --> 21:32.523
Are you Ian?

21:32.525 --> 21:33.758
I need to talk to you.

21:37.597 --> 21:39.530
You try to disrespect me?

21:40.300 --> 21:42.500
Please, just let me go.

22:14.634 --> 22:15.900
Wait, wait.

22:16.769 --> 22:18.069
Let's talk, all right?

22:19.339 --> 22:21.505
What do you wanna talk about?

22:21.507 --> 22:24.342
I think you guys are
looking for the wrong person.

22:25.345 --> 22:28.012
I'm not into mob or
anything like that.

22:29.349 --> 22:30.614
Because of you,
our friend is dead.

22:30.616 --> 22:32.483
And there's payback time.

22:33.052 --> 22:34.618
What?

22:34.620 --> 22:35.720
No, please.

22:35.722 --> 22:37.722
I didn't cause anyone's death.

22:37.724 --> 22:38.956
You got the wrong guy.

22:58.544 --> 23:00.044
Oh, I'm gonna die.

23:01.514 --> 23:02.780
I'm gonna die.

23:27.640 --> 23:29.073
Oh,

23:29.075 --> 23:30.075
Ian.

24:21.928 --> 24:25.729
can fly.

24:55.761 --> 24:58.028
Hey, what are you doing here?

25:01.734 --> 25:02.967
Do you wanna,

25:02.969 --> 25:04.134
wanna join me?

25:12.144 --> 25:16.213
Actually, will you allow
me to walk you home?

26:10.236 --> 26:11.936
What do you want from me?

26:11.938 --> 26:12.954
I didn't do anything.

26:12.955 --> 26:13.971
Who killed their buddies?

26:13.973 --> 26:14.939
What?

26:14.941 --> 26:16.290
Oh no.

26:16.291 --> 26:17.640
He's gonna come after me next.

26:17.643 --> 26:19.343
Who you talking about?

26:19.345 --> 26:20.678
Please, let me go.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.112
He's gonna come for me.

26:22.114 --> 26:23.114
Who is he?

26:24.150 --> 26:25.816
I don't know, a freak.

26:26.986 --> 26:29.086
He appears and disappears
out of nowhere.

26:39.899 --> 26:42.700
I want you to
go after someone.

26:42.702 --> 26:44.134
What, kill him?

26:45.104 --> 26:47.237
And if you don't
complete this,

26:47.239 --> 26:49.206
I'm gonna come after you.

26:54.880 --> 26:56.880
Can you describe the
look of this person

26:56.882 --> 26:58.682
you are trying to run away from?

26:59.251 --> 27:00.251
I don't know.

27:01.787 --> 27:03.220
Long hair,

27:03.222 --> 27:04.622
no eyebrows.

27:05.291 --> 27:06.624
Heavy eyeliner.

27:07.293 --> 27:09.860
Slim, but fast and powerful.

27:14.767 --> 27:15.767
Who are you?

27:17.970 --> 27:19.870
Private detective.

27:19.872 --> 27:22.706
I've been searching
for this man for years.

27:22.708 --> 27:23.641
Good luck with that.

27:23.643 --> 27:25.175
He is like a ghost.

27:25.177 --> 27:26.844
Well, you're probably right.

27:27.847 --> 27:29.527
What the hell are
you talking about?

27:30.316 --> 27:32.082
According to my study,

27:32.084 --> 27:33.183
he's no human.

27:33.185 --> 27:36.387
Some sort of
mythological entity.

27:37.289 --> 27:38.289
What?

27:44.196 --> 27:46.030
You better pray for your sins.

27:50.236 --> 27:51.435
Wait?

27:51.437 --> 27:52.936
What do you mean?

27:52.938 --> 27:53.871
Where you going, man?

27:53.872 --> 27:54.872
Come on, help me out.

27:57.009 --> 27:58.709
I can't guarantee,

27:58.711 --> 28:00.177
but you need to seek asylum

28:00.179 --> 28:01.679
from a member of the COJ.

28:06.352 --> 28:07.284
COJ?

28:07.285 --> 28:08.217
The Coalition of Justice.

28:08.220 --> 28:10.821
They're the ones that
fight against this guy.

28:10.823 --> 28:12.089
What?

28:12.091 --> 28:14.224
How am I supposed to find them?

28:14.226 --> 28:15.893
That, I don't know.

28:15.895 --> 28:17.311
Good luck, buddy.

28:17.312 --> 28:18.728
What, wait, can
I come with you?

28:18.731 --> 28:20.230
Sorry, man, I work alone.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.216
Oh, come on, man.

28:22.217 --> 28:23.777
Don't leave me out
here like this?

28:25.404 --> 28:27.104
Have I made myself clear?

28:29.241 --> 28:30.941
Yes, yes, yes.

28:30.943 --> 28:32.976
Just calm down, okay?

29:01.407 --> 29:02.407
Shit!

29:37.243 --> 29:39.977
What you think you're doing?

29:40.913 --> 29:42.513
Fuck you, you freak.

29:42.515 --> 29:44.248
What did you do to my friends?

29:45.317 --> 29:47.451
They deserve what they got.

29:48.387 --> 29:49.453
I'm gonna kill you.

29:49.455 --> 29:51.088
Come on, come on.

30:20.186 --> 30:21.585
Foolish human.

30:41.407 --> 30:42.506
Shut up.

30:55.988 --> 30:57.120
Time to die.

30:58.958 --> 31:00.424
Wait, wait.

31:00.426 --> 31:01.525
Please don't kill me.

31:01.527 --> 31:04.228
Just give me one more chance.

31:34.927 --> 31:35.626
Drink up.

31:35.627 --> 31:36.627
It'll help you calm down.

31:48.607 --> 31:51.241
I suppose you encountered
something unusual.

31:55.281 --> 31:57.180
What's going on?

31:57.182 --> 31:59.383
Who are these people that are
telling me strange things,

31:59.385 --> 32:00.517
and attacking me?

32:02.154 --> 32:03.620
You are the chosen one.

32:03.622 --> 32:05.989
What?

32:05.990 --> 32:08.357
Why are you saying the
same thing as that woman?

32:08.360 --> 32:10.460
You have been chosen
to be the Taven,

32:11.664 --> 32:14.564
the one who will counter
the fundamental darkness.

32:18.237 --> 32:20.304
The fundamental darkness,

32:20.306 --> 32:23.340
the negative force that
lies deep within our lives.

32:24.610 --> 32:27.477
It has existed since the
beginning of the Saha world.

32:30.049 --> 32:32.983
Viro is the manifestation

32:32.985 --> 32:34.952
of this negative force,

32:35.587 --> 32:37.471
so that it can cause the

32:37.472 --> 32:39.356
conspicuous
corrosion of society.

32:44.263 --> 32:46.229
Everyone can realize
or be connected

32:46.231 --> 32:47.464
to this fundamental darkness

32:47.466 --> 32:48.966
in the way that you have.

32:52.004 --> 32:54.237
Most people battle
it internally,

32:54.239 --> 32:55.639
through their consciousness.

32:55.641 --> 33:00.110
You're chosen because there
is a deep karma in you.

33:01.313 --> 33:02.479
A poison you must cultivate

33:02.481 --> 33:04.715
in order to turn into medicine.

33:06.018 --> 33:08.385
And Taven is the expedient means

33:08.387 --> 33:10.387
by which you can
accomplish this.

33:11.156 --> 33:13.457
The poison inside of me?

33:15.027 --> 33:18.195
Battling against
Viro is ultimately

33:18.197 --> 33:20.664
battling against
your own weakness,

33:20.666 --> 33:22.132
your own self-doubt.

33:23.302 --> 33:25.002
You have to win
over your own fear

33:25.004 --> 33:26.770
before you can win
over your enemy.

33:29.575 --> 33:32.342
Why are you so
familiar with this?

33:39.685 --> 33:41.685
I was once a Taven.

34:48.320 --> 34:49.320
So,

34:50.188 --> 34:51.321
that mysterious woman,

34:51.322 --> 34:53.255
she's a Taven, too?

34:53.257 --> 34:55.292
No, she's a messenger.

34:56.428 --> 34:58.628
In the network of the
Coalition of Justice, or COJ.

34:59.865 --> 35:02.332
We have messengers who are
candidates to be Taven,

35:03.569 --> 35:05.185
when the time is right for them.

35:05.186 --> 35:06.826
But I was
never a messenger.

35:12.311 --> 35:14.277
This is a part
I can't explain.

35:14.279 --> 35:17.214
I have a feeling there is
something unprecedented here.

35:20.252 --> 35:21.751
What should I do?

35:21.753 --> 35:23.520
Accept Rosie in.

35:23.522 --> 35:25.188
She needs your help.

35:25.190 --> 35:27.257
I think you are the keeper

35:27.258 --> 35:29.325
sent to help them
overcome this crisis.

35:46.445 --> 35:48.545
I've been waiting
for a successor.

35:49.414 --> 35:50.780
This is now yours.

36:13.305 --> 36:14.704
How do you manage
to wait for me

36:14.706 --> 36:17.307
here every day to walk me home?

36:18.510 --> 36:19.510
I have my way.

36:20.679 --> 36:22.379
I can travel really fast.

36:23.382 --> 36:25.382
That
sounds so weird.

36:25.384 --> 36:28.318
Sometimes you really sound
like a freak, you know?

36:29.221 --> 36:30.220
Really?

36:30.222 --> 36:31.722
Yeah.

36:31.723 --> 36:33.223
Also it's funny how
sometimes I feel

36:33.225 --> 36:35.392
like you're just
standing next to me.

36:36.929 --> 36:38.461
You're funny.

36:41.733 --> 36:42.733
I'm joking.

36:44.469 --> 36:47.537
The truth is I care.

36:47.539 --> 36:50.540
I just wanna be able
to see you every day.

36:53.879 --> 36:54.879
What?

37:00.352 --> 37:01.718
What do you have over there?

37:01.720 --> 37:03.820
You've been carrying
it all night.

37:08.560 --> 37:09.226
This thing?

37:09.227 --> 37:10.227
This is actually for you.

37:20.772 --> 37:23.773
I wanted to return
you a new one.

37:29.414 --> 37:30.414
May I?

37:52.904 --> 37:54.037
Thank you.

38:05.984 --> 38:07.417
I like you.

38:13.692 --> 38:17.661
Come on, run me home.

39:04.409 --> 39:05.375
Chloe!

39:23.762 --> 39:25.061
Are you okay?

39:26.598 --> 39:28.631
Is everything okay?

39:33.038 --> 39:34.371
You

39:34.373 --> 39:35.772
leave her alone.

39:37.642 --> 39:39.576
It's not up to you to decide.

39:40.912 --> 39:42.679
She's innocent.

39:42.681 --> 39:44.080
Don't do this to her.

39:45.517 --> 39:46.700
Wait a minute.

39:46.701 --> 39:47.884
Am I missing something?

39:50.822 --> 39:52.789
Let's end this now.

39:52.791 --> 39:54.057
Fight me.

39:54.059 --> 39:55.792
Wait, wait!

40:00.866 --> 40:03.066
No.

40:03.068 --> 40:04.167
No,

40:04.169 --> 40:05.169
just go.

40:35.600 --> 40:40.703
Come on,
come to me.

41:10.869 --> 41:11.869
Hi!

41:13.805 --> 41:14.805
Hi.

41:16.041 --> 41:17.807
What secret do you have for me?

41:18.810 --> 41:22.579
Oh, yes, I have
a big secret for you.

41:22.581 --> 41:24.547
Are you excited?

41:24.549 --> 41:25.582
I guess so.

41:25.584 --> 41:28.885
Do you want
to know the secret

41:28.887 --> 41:34.023
of becoming powerful?

41:39.564 --> 41:41.030
Yes, very much.

41:43.802 --> 41:46.569
Good, but it's not fair

41:46.571 --> 41:47.770
if only I am

41:47.772 --> 41:49.239
telling a secret.

41:50.742 --> 41:54.511
Do you want me to
tell you a secret, too?

41:54.513 --> 41:56.813
Actually, no.

41:56.815 --> 42:01.885
I just want you to promise
me something.

42:02.587 --> 42:04.053
I feel so lonely.

42:05.190 --> 42:10.527
Will you be my friend
forever?

42:20.839 --> 42:22.539
Yes.

42:22.541 --> 42:24.807
I will be your friend forever.

42:24.809 --> 42:25.842
Yay!

42:25.844 --> 42:27.944
Okay, come closer to me.

42:27.946 --> 42:33.082
I want to feel you.

43:57.902 --> 43:59.736
Taven calling out!

44:02.774 --> 44:04.941
Fuck, this is stupid.

44:09.681 --> 44:11.180
Oh!

44:11.182 --> 44:12.348
What are you doing?

44:12.350 --> 44:16.786
Well, you know, trying
to give you some signals.

44:16.788 --> 44:18.221
I know.

44:18.223 --> 44:20.923
It was fun watching
you for a while.

44:20.925 --> 44:22.792
Very funny.

44:23.361 --> 44:25.828
So, why do you want to see me?

44:26.831 --> 44:27.930
I wanna help you.

44:27.932 --> 44:32.935
I wanna understand more
about Viro, Taven, and...

44:33.772 --> 44:35.238
Her name is Romona.

44:35.240 --> 44:37.106
She was the Taven one year ago,

44:37.108 --> 44:38.675
who fought against Viro.

44:39.310 --> 44:41.010
What happened to her?

44:41.012 --> 44:42.679
She gave herself too deep

44:42.681 --> 44:44.881
into the real power
of the original Taven.

44:45.450 --> 44:47.684
And now it is holding her soul,

44:47.686 --> 44:49.185
as hostage.

44:49.187 --> 44:51.821
You mean Taven
did this to her?

44:53.892 --> 44:55.091
Yes.

44:55.093 --> 44:57.160
Original Taven is not a saint.

44:57.162 --> 45:01.330
It is a vehicle, turning
poison into medicine.

45:01.332 --> 45:03.299
Thus, it is still
venomous itself.

45:04.836 --> 45:07.170
So this is
what I'm in for,

45:07.172 --> 45:09.238
to help awaken another Taven?

45:11.309 --> 45:12.975
The thing is,

45:12.977 --> 45:14.777
I only know that you will have

45:14.779 --> 45:16.179
the ability to communicate

45:16.181 --> 45:17.480
with the original Taven.

45:20.085 --> 45:22.125
But I don't know how to
instruct you to do that.

45:24.723 --> 45:26.289
I suppose I'll find out.

45:26.291 --> 45:27.390
Please, Ian.

45:27.392 --> 45:29.258
I'm counting on you to save her.

45:30.128 --> 45:31.394
Where can I find her?

45:33.865 --> 45:35.832
She's in a deeper sleep.

45:35.834 --> 45:38.267
I kept her in a compartment
at this location

45:38.269 --> 45:40.503
where all destructions
can be avoided.

45:42.140 --> 45:44.474
I can't really get
near by her anymore

45:45.877 --> 45:47.777
because of the dark force
that has been building

45:47.779 --> 45:50.747
up around her by
the original Taven.

45:50.749 --> 45:52.381
Only a soul that
carried the same

45:52.383 --> 45:55.284
energy force as Taven
can approach her now,

45:56.287 --> 45:58.421
and the possessor
of that soul is you.

48:43.321 --> 48:44.987
Hey, buddy.

48:44.989 --> 48:46.055
Yeah, let's do it.

48:46.925 --> 48:48.457
Let's record something nice.

48:49.928 --> 48:52.461
And we'll talk about
it when you come over.

48:52.463 --> 48:53.596
Okay, see you.

49:13.351 --> 49:14.483
You've gone weak.

49:16.454 --> 49:19.055
Aren't you tired of
being in this evil cycle?

49:19.724 --> 49:20.990
Why not quit?

49:21.726 --> 49:23.592
It will never end,

49:23.594 --> 49:25.494
as long as civilization is here.

49:27.565 --> 49:30.232
I am the shadow
of your existence.

49:31.502 --> 49:33.202
Why are you here, really?

49:34.572 --> 49:36.539
You.

49:36.541 --> 49:39.442
I want you to be the catalyst

49:39.444 --> 49:41.744
to draw them all
to the final fight.

49:43.247 --> 49:45.648
Are you declaring
war this time?

49:45.650 --> 49:47.016
Yes.

49:48.252 --> 49:50.186
I'm gonna kill both of them,

49:50.188 --> 49:52.321
and seal the deal with the COJ.

49:53.524 --> 49:56.158
You will be
cursed for eternity,

49:56.160 --> 49:58.527
by both the COJ and
your own creator.

49:59.397 --> 50:02.231
It doesn't matter anymore.

50:02.233 --> 50:04.467
I'm already cursed for
something forbidden.

50:07.705 --> 50:10.272
Why don't you just
surrender to your doom?

50:11.609 --> 50:14.510
You're forgetting about
a character in us humans,

50:15.279 --> 50:16.345
dignity.

50:21.052 --> 50:22.184
I suppose.

50:25.056 --> 50:27.556
What do I know about dignity?

50:31.462 --> 50:34.030
I'm just your darkest fear.

50:38.569 --> 50:40.369
My return gift for you.

50:50.248 --> 50:51.213
Too bad.

50:51.215 --> 50:54.617
I won't get to see
the end of your story.

50:57.155 --> 50:58.155
Goodbye,

50:58.756 --> 50:59.756
Wing.

51:40.264 --> 51:43.365
Rose, in time
we shall meet again

51:43.367 --> 51:46.469
under the world of
tranquility, Alice.

51:49.474 --> 51:51.273
Where are you, Alice?

52:04.222 --> 52:05.521
Long time no see.

52:07.125 --> 52:09.358
Alice, what happened to you?

52:09.360 --> 52:10.893
I'm fine.

52:10.895 --> 52:13.662
In fact, I feel great.

52:13.664 --> 52:14.830
Come back, Alice!

52:14.832 --> 52:16.132
Don't fall for this!

52:16.134 --> 52:17.766
Stop this evil cycle!

52:17.768 --> 52:19.668
What are you talking about?

52:19.670 --> 52:22.538
I'm not involved in
some sort of evil cycle.

52:22.540 --> 52:23.506
Yes, you are.

52:23.508 --> 52:24.640
You're derailed.

52:24.642 --> 52:26.342
Step out from this illusion.

52:26.344 --> 52:28.377
It's not too late!

52:28.379 --> 52:29.879
It's not an illusion, Rose.

52:31.149 --> 52:32.681
This is real power,

52:33.684 --> 52:36.552
power so real that you
can't even imagine.

52:37.855 --> 52:39.155
What power?

52:44.729 --> 52:45.729
This power.

52:50.868 --> 52:52.168
Alice.

52:55.540 --> 52:57.407
Why don't you join me?

52:57.408 --> 52:59.275
Come on, we can
create our own empire.

53:00.444 --> 53:01.444
No.

53:03.881 --> 53:05.781
Then this is
where we will part.

53:07.552 --> 53:09.618
If you choose to walk away,

53:10.888 --> 53:12.321
you will be my enemy.

53:13.424 --> 53:14.557
So be it.

53:14.559 --> 53:17.660
Isn't life full
of unexpectations?

53:22.266 --> 53:24.466
Watch me reap my triumph.

53:36.647 --> 53:38.314
She's turning into Davada.

53:38.950 --> 53:39.982
Shut up.

53:39.984 --> 53:41.884
You don't know anything.

53:41.886 --> 53:43.352
Help me understand!

53:46.657 --> 53:47.656
Please.

53:47.658 --> 53:50.693
Give me a chance
to earn your trust.

53:57.268 --> 53:58.268
I wanna help you.

54:00.805 --> 54:02.238
Let me join this fight.

54:08.913 --> 54:10.946
Are you sure you're
ready for this?

54:10.948 --> 54:13.282
I have been, for years.

54:13.284 --> 54:14.250
Even at the risk of

54:14.252 --> 54:15.292
your life?
- Yes.

54:18.256 --> 54:19.788
Ceremony Vanity.

54:20.925 --> 54:24.760
That is where and when
everything will be decided.

54:24.762 --> 54:25.794
I will be there.

54:27.431 --> 54:28.664
Be careful.

54:28.666 --> 54:30.466
Something will try to stop you.

54:43.648 --> 54:44.713
Too hard.

54:46.717 --> 54:48.584
So swollen.

54:55.026 --> 54:56.925
Why can't life
be more peaceful?

55:00.831 --> 55:01.997
Why do you say that?

55:01.999 --> 55:05.834
Why do people judge
each other so badly

55:05.836 --> 55:07.970
before understanding first?

55:11.442 --> 55:12.808
I don't know.

55:14.812 --> 55:16.312
Perhaps due to instincts.

55:18.683 --> 55:21.016
Or maybe bad memories.

55:23.487 --> 55:25.954
I don't think he
understands you the way I do.

55:28.726 --> 55:30.693
You mean Ian?

55:30.695 --> 55:32.728
He's never like
that to anyone.

55:33.597 --> 55:36.465
He seems to hate you so much.

55:38.536 --> 55:39.536
I'm sorry.

55:40.971 --> 55:42.738
It's all because of me.

55:42.740 --> 55:44.373
No.

55:44.375 --> 55:45.607
It's not your fault.

55:50.815 --> 55:53.382
I hope you accept me one day.

55:54.552 --> 55:56.752
I'll need to talk to him.

55:56.754 --> 55:58.754
I don't want you
two to be like this.

56:12.370 --> 56:13.370
Stay still.

56:15.039 --> 56:17.406
I'm going to try to
make you feel better.

56:18.442 --> 56:19.508
Close your eyes.

56:55.546 --> 56:57.813
Oh, my God!

57:02.586 --> 57:03.586
Come here.

57:12.596 --> 57:14.129
Who are you, really?

57:15.599 --> 57:16.698
What do you mean?

57:17.568 --> 57:19.168
I knew from the beginning

57:19.169 --> 57:20.809
that you are not
who you say you are.

57:24.141 --> 57:26.909
Who do you think I am then?

57:26.911 --> 57:29.211
A ghost, I don't know.

57:29.213 --> 57:31.814
You're too precise.

57:31.816 --> 57:33.515
There's no complexity in you.

57:37.822 --> 57:39.087
Chloe?

57:39.089 --> 57:40.089
Yeah?

57:42.860 --> 57:45.093
I have something
to give to you.

57:51.769 --> 57:52.769
Oh.

57:53.637 --> 57:57.139
Where did you get this?

57:57.141 --> 57:58.574
It's a special thing.

57:59.477 --> 58:01.910
Only made from your hometown.

58:04.482 --> 58:06.849
When it glows even brighter,

58:07.785 --> 58:10.886
it means I'm thinking
about you a lot.

58:13.657 --> 58:15.524
And when it happens,

58:16.527 --> 58:19.962
would you hold it and
think about me, too?

58:19.964 --> 58:21.497
I will feel it.

59:13.050 --> 59:15.651
You are playing with fire.

59:24.061 --> 59:26.962
And you can't
control it anymore.

59:28.566 --> 59:29.798
You

59:29.800 --> 59:31.066
cannot confuse

59:31.869 --> 59:32.869
me.

59:34.572 --> 59:36.705
Taven will defeat you.

59:37.741 --> 59:38.741
Never!

59:40.244 --> 59:42.277
It is a futile cycle.

01:00:17.615 --> 01:00:19.147
Ceremony Vanity.

01:00:21.752 --> 01:00:22.918
Are you ready, Taven?

01:00:23.921 --> 01:00:24.921
Yes.

01:00:27.257 --> 01:00:29.091
The battleground
is over there.

01:00:31.729 --> 01:00:32.828
Be careful.

01:04:13.116 --> 01:04:14.349
Detective Leone.

01:04:14.351 --> 01:04:16.184
You must get going now.

01:04:16.987 --> 01:04:18.386
Why?

01:04:18.388 --> 01:04:20.388
No time to explain.

01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:22.224
Do as I say.

01:04:22.226 --> 01:04:23.491
Call me when you leave.

01:04:50.554 --> 01:04:52.053
Stay here, you're safe.

01:04:53.223 --> 01:04:54.289
I'll be right back.

01:04:55.058 --> 01:04:56.058
Okay?

01:05:40.437 --> 01:05:41.703
Hello?

01:05:41.705 --> 01:05:42.854
Hey, so I'm outside.

01:05:42.855 --> 01:05:44.004
What's all the commotion?

01:05:46.310 --> 01:05:47.175
Hello?

01:05:48.178 --> 01:05:49.178
Hello?

01:05:55.085 --> 01:05:56.085
Holly!

01:06:05.495 --> 01:06:07.729
Rose, that son of a
bitch killed my friend!

01:06:08.966 --> 01:06:10.999
I told her to stay home, Rose.

01:06:11.001 --> 01:06:12.617
How could I?

01:06:12.618 --> 01:06:14.234
I thought it would
be safe for her.

01:06:14.237 --> 01:06:15.236
Stay strong.

01:06:15.238 --> 01:06:19.407
It is the way he is
trying to defeat you.

01:06:19.409 --> 01:06:21.076
You must keep going.

01:06:27.584 --> 01:06:29.184
I'll see
you in a minute.

01:06:29.186 --> 01:06:30.251
Stay alert.

01:07:01.018 --> 01:07:03.518
The ceremony has begun.

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:04.520
Who are you?

01:07:05.389 --> 01:07:07.706
I'm Leone,

01:07:07.707 --> 01:07:10.024
and I'll be hosting the show
on behalf of Rose tonight.

01:07:11.695 --> 01:07:12.695
It's Rose.

01:07:15.198 --> 01:07:16.431
She tricked me.

01:07:28.645 --> 01:07:30.278
What's the matter, Davada?

01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:31.446
Feeling stupid?

01:07:33.050 --> 01:07:33.748
You'll pay for this,

01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:36.117
you stupid human.

01:07:47.597 --> 01:07:48.763
What now, Alice?

01:07:48.765 --> 01:07:52.100
Why don't you come
out and surrender?

01:07:59.443 --> 01:08:01.276
Alice?

01:08:14.491 --> 01:08:15.491
Alice?

01:08:22.399 --> 01:08:23.399
Alice?

01:08:40.517 --> 01:08:41.517
Alice?

01:09:11.481 --> 01:09:12.814
Shit.

01:09:12.816 --> 01:09:14.849
Now you know who
you're up against.

01:09:17.554 --> 01:09:18.554
What?

01:09:19.421 --> 01:09:20.421
Are you scared?

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:24.759
I won't kill you now.

01:09:26.897 --> 01:09:29.831
I like to keep some of
my adversaries around.

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:31.466
You are crazy!

01:09:32.368 --> 01:09:33.368
Maybe,

01:09:34.237 --> 01:09:35.636
but I love the feeling.

01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:44.245
Sorry, Rose.

01:09:49.419 --> 01:09:51.486
I hope I bought you enough time.

01:10:08.972 --> 01:10:11.239
Finally, you're here.

01:10:58.788 --> 01:11:00.488
Stay strong, Taven.

01:11:30.587 --> 01:11:31.986
Dammit, Taven.

01:11:33.023 --> 01:11:34.822
Why don't you just die?

01:11:35.959 --> 01:11:38.960
I can't, not
before I defeat you.

01:11:39.829 --> 01:11:40.962
Let me go.

01:11:40.964 --> 01:11:45.633
I found a way to stay
in the Saha world.

01:11:45.635 --> 01:11:47.835
I don't wanna leave again.

01:11:49.439 --> 01:11:51.739
No, you must pay retribution

01:11:51.741 --> 01:11:53.741
for your negative causes first.

01:11:57.981 --> 01:12:00.315
Remember the essence of Taven?

01:12:01.851 --> 01:12:03.551
Here it is again.

01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:10.325
I hate the essence of Taven.

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:52.160
What's going on?

01:14:32.235 --> 01:14:33.734
Chloe, Chloe,

01:14:35.972 --> 01:14:37.572
can you hear me?

01:14:45.048 --> 01:14:47.048
Hear me please, Chloe.

01:14:48.151 --> 01:14:49.617
Will you hear me?

01:14:50.753 --> 01:14:51.819
I need you.

01:14:53.690 --> 01:14:55.223
I need you, Chloe.

01:15:35.532 --> 01:15:36.931
Get up, Taven!

01:15:37.734 --> 01:15:38.733
Fight me.

01:16:17.607 --> 01:16:20.975
I feel weak, so weak.

01:16:21.844 --> 01:16:23.010
Have I fallen?

01:16:24.681 --> 01:16:26.581
Have I failed true faith?

01:16:27.617 --> 01:16:28.983
I'm trying so hard,

01:16:28.985 --> 01:16:33.087
but maybe I'm just
not strong enough.

01:16:35.124 --> 01:16:37.124
Wake up, Ian.

01:16:38.261 --> 01:16:39.727
It's not over.

01:17:11.961 --> 01:17:13.227
What's this?

01:17:22.138 --> 01:17:23.738
Stop this now!

01:17:24.741 --> 01:17:26.340
Don't kill anymore.

01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:32.913
Pay for your sin, Viro.

01:19:41.844 --> 01:19:42.910
Rest assure,

01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:46.247
I'm not Viro anymore.

01:19:51.487 --> 01:19:53.921
Before I'm forever condemned

01:19:55.124 --> 01:19:57.258
I just wanna say

01:19:57.260 --> 01:20:00.961
that I was once alive
in this world,

01:20:02.999 --> 01:20:06.367
living with someone
that I loved very much.

01:20:12.008 --> 01:20:13.808
My name was Tiga.

01:20:16.879 --> 01:20:19.814
And Luna was the
love of my life.

01:20:22.518 --> 01:20:26.086
I once existed in
this world of Saha.

01:20:29.158 --> 01:20:30.925
We laughed,

01:20:30.927 --> 01:20:34.228
and we lived our
lives to the fullest.

01:20:36.098 --> 01:20:37.498
And all I wanted to do

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:39.867
was to keep her close to me,

01:20:40.937 --> 01:20:43.504
to protect her from harm.

01:20:43.506 --> 01:20:48.175
And to offer everything
I had to make her happy.

01:20:54.417 --> 01:20:56.951
But she became ill,

01:20:56.953 --> 01:20:57.953
and died,

01:20:58.855 --> 01:21:00.621
of a mysterious cause.

01:21:02.058 --> 01:21:03.991
And I was devastated.

01:21:07.096 --> 01:21:08.963
I asked myself why,

01:21:10.566 --> 01:21:14.034
why should a good
person like her

01:21:15.171 --> 01:21:16.403
deserve such tragedy?

01:21:19.008 --> 01:21:20.140
It's not fair.

01:21:22.645 --> 01:21:26.313
I lost hope, and I began
to hate this world.

01:21:27.316 --> 01:21:29.650
I had gone mad and
murdered the doctor

01:21:29.652 --> 01:21:31.352
who tried to cure her,

01:21:32.154 --> 01:21:34.421
and I carved his heart out.

01:21:36.592 --> 01:21:38.058
But I wasn't happier.

01:21:39.562 --> 01:21:42.196
A dead heart could
not bring back

01:21:42.198 --> 01:21:44.431
the love of my life.

01:21:49.472 --> 01:21:52.172
At that moment it approached,

01:21:54.243 --> 01:21:56.443
the fundamental darkness.

01:22:10.559 --> 01:22:12.493
I sold my soul to it,

01:22:13.596 --> 01:22:16.196
and vowed to bring calamities

01:22:16.198 --> 01:22:19.033
to wherever it designated me to,

01:22:20.636 --> 01:22:23.270
with the ultimate evil.

01:22:31.614 --> 01:22:35.316
But she came back
as Chloe to find me.

01:22:38.721 --> 01:22:40.487
Trying to awaken me,

01:22:42.625 --> 01:22:45.092
to nirvana and love.

01:22:47.196 --> 01:22:48.963
I will follow her trail,

01:22:50.066 --> 01:22:51.066
and find her.

01:22:52.969 --> 01:22:54.569
And I'll ask for
her forgiveness.

01:23:14.991 --> 01:23:16.357
Thank you, Taven.

01:23:32.441 --> 01:23:34.208
That was the
last I've learned about

01:23:34.210 --> 01:23:35.542
what happened from Rose.

01:23:35.544 --> 01:23:39.246
A broken soul got a second
chance to pursue his love.

01:23:40.416 --> 01:23:43.684
It was one of the strangest
cases I've encountered.

01:23:43.686 --> 01:23:45.786
And the mystery
continues to affect me,

01:23:46.589 --> 01:23:48.455
as if it hasn't ended yet.
