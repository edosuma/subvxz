01:36.304 --> 01:39.932
Come on, let's find this guy.
I know he's here somewhere.

01:41.351 --> 01:45.020
Come on, look for him. Just keep going.
We're gonna find him. I know it's here.

01:46.231 --> 01:47.731
- There!
- Over to the right.

01:47.899 --> 01:50.859
See over there? See anything?

01:52.487 --> 01:54.404
- That's it.
- There it is!

01:54.864 --> 01:57.199
That's it. All right!

02:00.745 --> 02:02.788
- This is it.
- Let's rip this sucker open!

02:02.956 --> 02:05.332
Gotta get a look at the main man.

02:08.502 --> 02:09.794
Yee-haw!

02:13.007 --> 02:15.717
Come on, dig. Deeper.

02:19.806 --> 02:24.726
Come on, dig. Come on, let's dig.
Come on, faster. Dig.

02:28.898 --> 02:30.399
Dig!

02:30.567 --> 02:34.444
Let's just get all the dirt off
and let's pry it open. This is it.

02:41.411 --> 02:42.995
Come on!

02:44.914 --> 02:47.749
- Pry.
- Move it over here.

02:51.379 --> 02:53.046
Harder. Come on.

02:56.968 --> 03:00.929
- Come on, Neil!
- Unh. Okay, here it comes.

04:52.709 --> 04:55.210
No. No.

05:07.682 --> 05:09.224
No!

08:27.215 --> 08:28.465
That must be the new kid.

08:48.569 --> 08:51.530
Last stop, everybody out.

08:51.739 --> 08:53.698
Tommy? Hey.

08:58.704 --> 09:02.999
No? Beautiful. Sit there.
I don't give a shit.

09:03.751 --> 09:06.795
Hey. How you doing?

09:08.047 --> 09:10.882
Tommy Jarvis?
Hi, my name is Pam Roberts.

09:11.050 --> 09:14.886
I'm the assistant director.
I'm glad you're here.

09:18.975 --> 09:23.728
Well, if you'd like to grab your things,
I'll take you in to meet the doctor, okay?

09:28.985 --> 09:30.402
Great.

09:32.154 --> 09:33.989
Thank you.

09:36.242 --> 09:38.493
Anytime, doll.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.459
How was the ride?

09:48.170 --> 09:50.088
Come on, Tommy.

09:52.758 --> 09:54.593
You okay?

10:03.060 --> 10:04.102
Come in.

10:05.563 --> 10:07.230
Hi.

10:08.357 --> 10:12.110
Hi, Tommy. I'm Matthew Letter.
Welcome to Pinehurst. Have a seat.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.615
Sit down, son.

10:19.827 --> 10:22.495
Uh, what I'm gonna do is tell you
a little about Pinehurst...

10:22.663 --> 10:26.666
...and then we'll let you get settled
in your room. How does that sound?

10:29.587 --> 10:31.379
Tommy?

10:32.423 --> 10:34.424
How does that sound?

10:36.594 --> 10:37.969
Sure.

10:41.974 --> 10:45.852
All right. About Pinehurst...

10:46.020 --> 10:48.938
...you'll find we're very different
from the state institution.

10:49.106 --> 10:51.816
Uh, we don't have any guards here...

10:51.984 --> 10:54.944
...nobody's gonna tell you what
you can do or what you can't do.

10:55.112 --> 10:59.824
-Basically, you're your own boss.
-It's an honor system, Tommy.

11:01.035 --> 11:04.162
What you're really doing here, Tommy...

11:04.330 --> 11:08.917
...is preparing yourself to reenter
society and start a new life.

11:10.920 --> 11:14.547
So, Pam, you wanna point Tommy
toward his room and get him started?

11:14.715 --> 11:19.594
Sure. Okay? All right, you go
through the kitchen, up the stairs...

11:19.762 --> 11:24.265
...and it's the first door on your left, okay?
I'll see you in a bit.

11:29.438 --> 11:30.689
So, what do you think?

11:32.066 --> 11:33.775
-The kid's a real talker.
-Heh.

11:33.943 --> 11:37.153
I noticed. How'd they diagnose it?

11:37.321 --> 11:39.781
Uh, "Severe trauma at age 12.

11:39.949 --> 11:43.535
Brutal self-defense murder
of a psychopathic killer."

11:44.245 --> 11:46.079
Boy, they've given him
every treatment...

11:46.247 --> 11:47.914
...every therapy they can think of.

11:48.082 --> 11:51.710
It's a wonder his mind isn't fried,
with all the drugs they've given him.

12:59.779 --> 13:04.240
You scared of spiders?
You scared of rubber spiders?

13:06.118 --> 13:11.998
You scared of rubber spiders on strings?
Man, you are one scared cat.

13:13.375 --> 13:17.378
Where I come from,
you learn to be scared of nothing.

13:17.588 --> 13:21.800
They call me Reggie the Reckless.
No spider would scare me.

13:23.219 --> 13:25.053
Yo, man!

14:03.425 --> 14:05.093
Don't.

14:05.261 --> 14:08.137
You don't have to get all
twisted out of shape about it.

14:08.305 --> 14:11.599
I mean, you act like you made
these things or something.

14:11.767 --> 14:12.892
I did.

14:15.312 --> 14:16.980
Solid.

14:19.650 --> 14:21.192
So you're the new nut, huh?

14:22.278 --> 14:26.030
-Is that what they call us?
-Us? I ain't one of you, man.

14:26.198 --> 14:29.325
I'm just visiting.
My granddaddy works here.

14:33.247 --> 14:36.165
Oh, gotta split.
Catch you later. There's action.

14:39.461 --> 14:43.006
Joey, come on. Hurry up. Oh, my God!
Whoo!

14:43.799 --> 14:47.260
Hey, you guys. Joey, come on.

14:52.349 --> 14:54.183
Stop, come on. Don't!

14:54.393 --> 14:56.686
-Come on, stop!
-Stay right here.

15:03.027 --> 15:06.654
- Hey, Matt. How's it going?
- All right, sheriff. What's up?

15:06.822 --> 15:09.449
Well, Matt, you know,
it's like we talked about.

15:09.617 --> 15:12.660
You got some neighbors who aren't
too happy about your place here.

15:12.828 --> 15:16.915
Now, I certainly know what it is you're
trying to do, and I respect it, Matt, I do.

15:17.082 --> 15:22.378
But, well, we found a couple of your
kids on the Hubbard place again.

15:22.546 --> 15:24.047
-Deputy!
-Yes, sir.

15:24.214 --> 15:26.049
- Bring them out.
- Yes, sir.

15:28.302 --> 15:29.344
Everybody out.

15:30.721 --> 15:32.722
Cut out the fooling around.
Fall in by the sheriff.

15:32.890 --> 15:34.849
-Yes, sir.
-Just get moving, wise guy.

15:42.483 --> 15:44.233
We found them
in the Hubbards' woods.

15:44.401 --> 15:46.903
They were screwing
their heads off, Matt.

15:47.071 --> 15:50.615
Now, I think we're all pretty lucky this time,
because Ethel didn't see them.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.867
I'll take care of it, sheriff.

16:00.793 --> 16:05.296
-I'm gonna do the talking. You keep quiet.
-Morning, Ethel.

16:05.464 --> 16:07.632
-My, don't you look lovely today.
-Horseshit!

16:07.800 --> 16:10.093
Now, sheriff, you better hear me
and hear me good.

16:10.260 --> 16:12.303
I want this loony bin closed down.

16:12.471 --> 16:16.099
Do you hear me, fella? Now, these kids
ain't nothing but trouble!

16:16.266 --> 16:19.811
They don't respect others' property
and they're all crazy!

16:19.979 --> 16:23.439
-You tell them, Ma! Ha, ha.
-Ethel, these kids weren't doing....

16:23.607 --> 16:25.775
Doing? Doing?

16:25.943 --> 16:29.320
You think I don't know what those
two perverts were doing in my yard?

16:29.488 --> 16:34.492
-Say it like you mean it, Ma!
-Would you shut the fuck up?

16:38.872 --> 16:40.790
Now, I'm gonna tell all of you:

16:41.834 --> 16:46.295
You mark my words, the next little
bastard comes near my farm...

16:46.463 --> 16:49.966
...I'm gonna blow your fucking brains out.
You hear me?

16:50.134 --> 16:53.136
Don't you come near me, sheriff.
I've warned you.

16:53.303 --> 16:55.555
I got a bomb on me.
I swear to you!

16:55.723 --> 16:59.142
You make one move toward me,
I'm gonna blow us all up.

16:59.309 --> 17:04.355
Start the engines, Junior.
That's it. My final words.

17:07.693 --> 17:10.111
Okay, people. Come on, let's go.
Party's over.

17:13.490 --> 17:16.992
- Come on, you guys.
- We better go back inside.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.998
-She's really something, ain't she?
-Jesus.

17:22.165 --> 17:26.044
Seriously, Matt, I'd make an extra effort
to keep your kids off her property.

17:26.211 --> 17:27.837
-I will.
-Now, listen, by the way...

17:28.005 --> 17:30.339
...I understand
you got the Jarvis kid today.

17:30.507 --> 17:33.676
-Yeah, he arrived a little while ago.
-And?

17:33.844 --> 17:36.137
-And what?
-Well, what's he like?

17:36.305 --> 17:40.183
He's like any other kid. He's just, uh....
He's been through a lot, that's all.

17:40.350 --> 17:46.064
-Yeah. Well, good luck with him, pal.
-Thanks a lot, sheriff.

18:38.158 --> 18:40.535
-Hi, girls.
-Hi, Joey.

18:40.702 --> 18:42.537
-Hi, Violet.
-Huh?

18:42.704 --> 18:44.580
-Hi!
-Yeah.

18:45.457 --> 18:48.042
-What are you doing?
-Doing laundry, Joey.

18:48.210 --> 18:51.254
Can I help? I'm really very good
at doing laundry.

18:51.421 --> 18:53.798
Matt never assigns it to me,
I don't know why.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.926
Look, Joey, we really have
to get this thing finished, okay?

18:57.094 --> 18:59.720
So I'm here to help you.

18:59.888 --> 19:03.307
You can count on me, Rob. You too, Vi.

19:03.475 --> 19:06.144
Want a chocolate bar? Here, you want it?

19:06.353 --> 19:10.148
-I'll give you half, but I need half for later.
-Piss off!

19:10.315 --> 19:12.483
Oh, please let me help you.
It's really no problem....

19:14.027 --> 19:16.821
-Joey! Will you just get out of here?
-Fuck!

19:16.989 --> 19:21.909
I'm sorry, you two.
Really, I can do laundry great.

19:22.077 --> 19:24.620
But, well, if that's how
you feel, forget it.

19:24.788 --> 19:28.958
I'll just go help somebody else instead.
I'll see you later.

19:29.126 --> 19:32.211
I can't believe this.

19:32.379 --> 19:34.714
Listen, if you change your mind,
I'll be right around, okay?

19:34.882 --> 19:36.966
-Joey!
-Joey.

19:37.134 --> 19:39.760
Jesus, what a loser.

19:41.430 --> 19:45.224
Look at this sheet.
I'm not gonna wash it. You wash it.

19:48.854 --> 19:51.355
-Hi, Vic!
-Get lost.

19:51.523 --> 19:56.110
Come on, don't be like that.
I'm gonna help you with the wood today.

19:56.278 --> 20:00.198
And anyway, uh,
I got two chocolate bars, see?

20:00.365 --> 20:04.452
-Don't tell the girls.
-Jeez, what an asshole.

20:07.998 --> 20:12.668
You know, Vic, before I came here,
I never had anything to do...

20:12.836 --> 20:15.171
...me being an orphan and all.

20:15.339 --> 20:17.506
People always teased me
about sitting around...

20:17.674 --> 20:19.926
...like some kind of pig or something.

20:20.093 --> 20:26.015
But here it's different. I can help
others and do a lot of things.

20:26.183 --> 20:29.143
You know something?
I really love it here.

20:30.979 --> 20:32.230
I hate it.

20:32.397 --> 20:36.692
You know, um, to be perfectly honest with
you, I never really chopped wood before...

20:36.860 --> 20:39.403
...but it certainly looks like fun.

20:40.781 --> 20:42.365
Leave me alone!

20:48.288 --> 20:50.122
Here, Vic. Want a bite?

20:50.290 --> 20:52.708
Here. I'll just put it over here...

20:52.876 --> 20:54.961
...and later on, when you're hungry,
you can have it.

20:57.547 --> 21:02.426
Well, if that's the way you feel,
forget it, Vic. Just forget it!

21:02.594 --> 21:05.763
But I think you're really out of line.

21:25.742 --> 21:29.787
Yeah, we got a homicide on our hands.
See what you got on a Faden.

21:29.955 --> 21:35.042
Victor J. Faden. F-A-D-E-N.
Thanks, Harry.

21:39.756 --> 21:43.467
- Shh. It's okay.
- Why?

21:51.268 --> 21:53.728
Is there someone we should notify?

21:54.938 --> 21:58.441
As far as I know,
there's no immediate family.

21:58.608 --> 22:00.151
Mother died while giving birth...

22:00.319 --> 22:04.405
...I don't know what the hell happened to the father.
Took off somewhere, I guess.

22:05.532 --> 22:09.618
This kid got shuffled around from
home to home till he came here.

22:11.204 --> 22:14.749
-He was a good kid.
-I know, Matt.

22:17.252 --> 22:20.379
So, what do we got here?

22:25.385 --> 22:26.677
Oh, God!

22:28.055 --> 22:29.388
It's all right.

22:35.312 --> 22:36.896
Bunch of pussies.

22:42.944 --> 22:46.280
Come on, Roy. Get your hands dirty.

23:14.601 --> 23:17.311
I'm telling you, Pete, this is bullshit!
This really sucks!

23:17.479 --> 23:21.190
Just do it. Fix it, man! Those cunts
aren't gonna wait all night.

23:22.609 --> 23:25.444
Oh, fuck! This is a mess.

23:31.743 --> 23:33.244
No way, I refuse to do this.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.663
You're the one who keeps
fucking around with this thing...

23:35.831 --> 23:38.958
...so get off your ass and you fix it!

23:39.126 --> 23:41.210
You understand?

23:41.545 --> 23:43.212
Pete!

23:47.884 --> 23:51.720
-You are an asshole!
-Aw, what's the matter, Vinnie?

23:51.888 --> 23:53.222
You scared of the dark?

23:53.390 --> 23:55.850
You all creeped out
by that murder at the nuthouse?

23:56.017 --> 23:58.978
Oh, yeah, sure. Look, as far as
I'm concerned, all those loonies...

23:59.146 --> 24:03.691
...should be killed off one by one.
Can you try it now?

24:05.610 --> 24:09.738
Jesus, man! Can't you do anything?
Stop screwing around!

24:09.906 --> 24:14.034
Get this done by the time I get back.
I gotta take a crap.

24:15.203 --> 24:18.956
-Crap, my ass!
-Just do it, man! I mean it.

24:21.626 --> 24:23.586
Fucking asshole!

25:10.133 --> 25:12.134
Oh, you little fuck.

25:22.604 --> 25:24.146
What are you doing, douche bag?

25:27.692 --> 25:29.443
Enough already. You can stop.

25:31.821 --> 25:33.155
Would you cut it out?

25:35.242 --> 25:37.034
Pete!

25:50.715 --> 25:53.717
All right, either you got the car
started or you're a dead man.

26:03.395 --> 26:06.272
This ain't starting, man.
You fucked up again. It ain't starting.

26:06.439 --> 26:09.483
I'm gonna kick your ass, kick your ass.

26:09.651 --> 26:12.736
Come on, now.
Come on, everybody, this ain't starting.

26:12.904 --> 26:16.615
Come on, motherfucker,
fix the fucking car.

26:16.783 --> 26:19.952
Come on.
You fucked up again, you asshole.

26:20.120 --> 26:22.663
What you doing up there, Vinnie?

26:27.460 --> 26:31.171
Whoo! All right.
And we're off. Let's go!

26:53.653 --> 26:54.987
<i>Die!</i>

26:56.906 --> 26:59.116
<i>- Die!</i>
- Tommy!

27:00.952 --> 27:02.411
<i>Die!</i>

27:02.954 --> 27:04.246
<i>Tommy!</i>

27:04.414 --> 27:06.915
<i>Die! Die!</i>

27:09.085 --> 27:13.047
<i>Die! Die! Die!</i>

27:17.010 --> 27:18.761
<i>Tommy!</i>

27:19.596 --> 27:21.347
<i>Die!</i>

27:21.765 --> 27:24.391
- Tommy!
<i>- Die!</i>

27:24.559 --> 27:25.643
<i>Die!</i>

27:27.854 --> 27:31.023
<i>Die! Die! Die!</i>

27:48.333 --> 27:50.209
There you go.

27:55.674 --> 27:58.133
- Gramps.
- What is it, son?

27:58.301 --> 28:00.678
Can I go see my brother?
He'll be in town tomorrow.

28:01.638 --> 28:04.306
We'll see.
You know how I feel about that.

28:04.474 --> 28:07.935
-But, Gramps....
-I said, we'll see, Reggie.

28:16.194 --> 28:17.653
Hey.

28:17.821 --> 28:20.656
Come here, Reggie the Reckless.

28:29.499 --> 28:32.835
Do me a favor. Don't kiss me
when there's people around, okay?

28:33.002 --> 28:38.674
Oh. Okay, it's cool. Go on and let
everyone else know breakfast is ready.

28:41.261 --> 28:44.596
Yo, breakfast! Come and get it!

28:45.682 --> 28:47.933
I could've done that.

28:50.395 --> 28:53.772
I, uh, miss Joey already.

28:53.940 --> 28:55.691
So do I.

28:55.859 --> 28:59.236
I hope Victor gets what's coming to him.

28:59.904 --> 29:03.031
- Morning, everybody.
- Morning.

29:05.660 --> 29:09.163
-Violet, you set too many places.
-Huh?

29:09.330 --> 29:12.416
I said, you set too many places.

29:12.584 --> 29:15.043
-No, I didn't.
-Yes, you did.

29:15.211 --> 29:18.714
Don't think Victor and Joey
will be joining us this morning, Violet.

29:18.882 --> 29:21.049
Heh, or any other morning.

29:21.217 --> 29:24.928
-Reggie!
-Oh, God. I'm sorry.

29:27.557 --> 29:31.101
You don't set a place for a dead person.

29:31.269 --> 29:35.522
-I said I was sorry!
-What's going on here?

29:50.747 --> 29:54.541
Look, I know how you all feel.

29:54.709 --> 29:58.587
This thing is not easy for any of us.

29:59.881 --> 30:02.257
So let's just have breakfast.

30:05.762 --> 30:07.930
I'm sorry, Vi. I was out of line.

30:16.523 --> 30:19.316
-Where's Eddie?
-He's upstairs.

30:20.109 --> 30:24.655
Tommy, would you mind telling
Eddie to come downstairs?

30:30.453 --> 30:33.747
Tommy? Would you mind?

30:37.126 --> 30:38.961
Yeah, all right.

30:50.390 --> 30:52.432
Asshole.

30:54.894 --> 30:57.896
Relax, chief.
What's wrong, no sense of humor?

30:58.064 --> 30:59.940
Can't you take a joke?

31:08.658 --> 31:13.328
Just relax. Just relax. It's all right.
It's all right. It's gonna be all right.

31:13.496 --> 31:18.208
Just relax. Yeah.
It's gonna be just fine.

31:24.215 --> 31:30.512
I'm gonna chop you into itty-bitty
little pieces, my friend.

31:30.680 --> 31:36.226
Just like they done to that piggo over
there at that fucking crazy farm, heh.

31:36.853 --> 31:38.353
Ee-yah!

31:39.022 --> 31:40.188
Ee-yah!

31:42.191 --> 31:46.069
You big dildo. Eat your fucking slop.

31:47.322 --> 31:50.657
Ain't I make the best goddamn stew
in the whole wide world?

31:50.825 --> 31:53.118
Best goddamn stew
in the whole wide world, Mama.

31:55.538 --> 31:59.499
It's that goddamn coyote,
gonna try to kill my lot again.

31:59.667 --> 32:03.045
I'm gonna show that bastard
once and for all. You hear me, Junior?

32:08.718 --> 32:13.013
Holy shit! Who the fuck are you
and what the fuck do you want?

32:14.015 --> 32:16.808
Ma'am, I ain't eaten in two days.
I'd like to earn a meal.

32:16.976 --> 32:21.897
-Yeah? What do you do?
-Whatever you need done.

32:22.440 --> 32:26.777
Okay. Clean all the shit
out of the chicken coop...

32:26.945 --> 32:28.737
...and dump it behind the shed.

32:28.947 --> 32:32.991
You come back here when you got all the
shit out and then I'll fill your stomach.

32:34.911 --> 32:37.162
Yes, ma'am.

32:44.671 --> 32:47.464
That is one fucking ugly man
that goes there.

32:47.632 --> 32:52.761
-That's one fucking ugly man, Mama.
-Would you shut your trap?

32:52.929 --> 32:55.305
You know, you ain't so pretty
yourself, you know.

32:55.515 --> 32:57.599
I ain't so pretty myself, I know.

33:03.314 --> 33:05.065
Hi-yah!

33:05.775 --> 33:08.193
I want every inch of this area
combed thoroughly.

33:08.361 --> 33:12.030
Bring back anything you find.
Anything. Get going.

33:12.198 --> 33:13.448
Yes, sir.

33:17.662 --> 33:20.706
What the hell's going on here?

33:20.873 --> 33:23.125
You talking to me, sheriff?

33:23.418 --> 33:25.002
-Huh?
-Oh.

33:25.169 --> 33:27.045
I thought you was talking to me.

33:27.213 --> 33:32.175
No, Roy. It's okay.
Go ahead. Get them out of here.

33:42.186 --> 33:46.606
Looks like we got us a maniac
on the loose, huh, sheriff?

34:05.001 --> 34:08.879
Lana! Hey, Lana!

34:10.172 --> 34:12.591
Sorry, buster. We're closed. Heh.

34:12.800 --> 34:15.385
That's all right.
I just want a takeout order.

34:15.553 --> 34:16.844
-You do, huh?
-Yeah.

34:17.013 --> 34:18.346
Well, what would you like?

34:18.514 --> 34:21.516
I would like Lana, to go,
with nothing on her.

34:21.684 --> 34:23.351
Oh? And who wants her?

34:25.521 --> 34:28.273
The pride of the
Unger Institute of Mental Health...

34:28.440 --> 34:31.818
...who has just dumped his last bedpan
and would like very much to party.

34:31.985 --> 34:33.779
Will you get your ass out here?

34:33.946 --> 34:37.824
Lana? Hmm, I don't know about that.
I'll have to ask her.

34:37.992 --> 34:41.828
Hey, Lana. You want Billy?
You sure?

34:43.331 --> 34:44.581
She says she wants you too.

34:44.748 --> 34:47.751
But you have to wait a few minutes
till she's done inside.

34:49.003 --> 34:50.337
Yahoo!

34:53.841 --> 34:56.467
There. I'm going to party.

35:07.522 --> 35:11.024
It's showtime. Ha, ha.

35:17.198 --> 35:18.907
That's it.

35:22.453 --> 35:26.540
That's it. That's the whole
fucking thing right there.

35:27.583 --> 35:31.294
There it is.
You just stay right there, doll.

35:31.462 --> 35:34.756
That's just what the doctor ordered.

35:35.216 --> 35:37.425
Nothing like a little
preventive medicine.

35:37.593 --> 35:41.680
And the forecast is
cloudy in the mountains...

35:41.848 --> 35:46.268
...sunny in the valleys
and snow flurries up your nose.

36:01.242 --> 36:02.284
Mm.

36:03.327 --> 36:06.246
<i>I don't know if he loves me</i>

36:06.414 --> 36:08.623
<i>But I think he does</i>

36:16.757 --> 36:18.341
Billy?

36:37.570 --> 36:39.571
Girl, you are so hot.

37:01.802 --> 37:03.553
Hey, Lana!

37:05.681 --> 37:08.225
What the fuck is she doing?

37:09.560 --> 37:11.228
Hey!

37:13.147 --> 37:15.982
Jesus Christ! Come on, will you?

37:16.150 --> 37:17.901
Lana!

37:18.069 --> 37:21.529
Hey! Hey!

37:27.703 --> 37:29.873
You bad kitty. You bad kitty.

37:29.899 --> 37:33.191
That isn't nice. I don't
like you anymore.

37:33.709 --> 37:37.879
You bad kitty. I feed you, I love you
and you scare me like that.

37:39.715 --> 37:41.299
Go on, kitty.

37:44.220 --> 37:45.679
Sorry, heh.

37:48.391 --> 37:50.267
Billy?

37:57.108 --> 38:00.235
Billy, what are you doing? It's cold.

38:10.496 --> 38:14.916
This is cute. I like this. A whole lot.

38:25.094 --> 38:28.596
You're gonna waste a lot of money
this way, smarty.

38:28.764 --> 38:31.516
Oh, well, that just means more for me.

38:32.435 --> 38:33.476
Oh.

38:34.562 --> 38:36.313
Mm, yummy.

38:40.151 --> 38:42.569
Oh, my God. Billy? Billy!

39:56.644 --> 40:00.397
I don't care if you have to put
your fucking mother behind bars!

40:00.606 --> 40:04.818
Get me the goddamn psycho
who's responsible for this mess.

40:05.486 --> 40:10.407
I mean, shit, Tucker,
what the hell's going on here?

40:10.574 --> 40:13.451
I mean, this is a small town, man.

40:13.619 --> 40:17.747
And small towns are supposed to be safe.

40:24.922 --> 40:26.756
I know who it is.

40:29.427 --> 40:33.972
-What?
-I said, I know who it is.

40:34.140 --> 40:39.477
-Who?
-It's Jason Voorhees.

40:41.605 --> 40:43.857
Jason Voorhees?

40:44.483 --> 40:47.861
You're out of your fucking mind!
You've been out in the sun too long.

40:48.028 --> 40:49.904
Jason Voorhees is dead!

40:50.072 --> 40:54.117
His body was cremated.
He's nothing but a handful of ash.

40:55.244 --> 40:57.036
You know that for sure, mayor?

40:57.204 --> 40:59.122
Were you there?
Did you see him cremated?

40:59.290 --> 41:00.874
-Jason Voorhees.
-Yes.

41:01.041 --> 41:02.750
I can't believe this!

41:02.918 --> 41:07.589
Here. This is your Jason Voorhees here.

41:08.132 --> 41:09.799
This.

41:15.306 --> 41:19.058
Your ass is on the line here, Tucker.
Are you getting that?

41:19.852 --> 41:22.937
You get me a goddamn live suspect.

41:42.791 --> 41:47.003
-You fuck! You really scared me.
-You loved it.

41:49.507 --> 41:53.551
-You want more?
-Eddie, we can't.

41:53.719 --> 41:56.596
-Matt'll kill us.
-Fuck him.

41:57.598 --> 42:02.644
-Fuck you.
-Exactly. Fuck me.

42:02.978 --> 42:05.021
Come on, Tina.

42:05.981 --> 42:08.399
Come on. Come on.

42:23.165 --> 42:24.707
Come on.

42:26.377 --> 42:29.295
Watch the dirt. Watch the dirt.

42:51.443 --> 42:53.570
-What?
-Wait. Wait a minute.

42:55.072 --> 42:56.489
Especially for the occasion.

44:01.513 --> 44:04.724
-I gotta go wash up.
-Okay, sugar.

44:13.484 --> 44:16.444
-Hurry back.
-I'm hurrying.

45:47.369 --> 45:48.995
I'm back.

45:51.081 --> 45:54.041
What is this? Sleeping? Hey.

46:29.995 --> 46:31.788
Let's get this show on the road!

46:31.955 --> 46:34.457
Wait a minute, Reggie, I'm coming.

46:34.625 --> 46:35.917
I just don't understand it.

46:37.461 --> 46:40.630
Now, Reggie,
I want you to be a good kid with Pam.

46:40.798 --> 46:44.801
-She's doing us both a great favor.
-Yeah, if she ever gets here.

46:44.968 --> 46:47.720
And don't go getting in any trouble
with Demon, you hear?

46:47.888 --> 46:51.641
All right, all right. Yo, Pam, come on!

46:51.809 --> 46:55.269
Tina and Eddie are gonna show up
the minute they get hungry...

46:55.437 --> 46:57.396
...so stop worrying.

46:57.564 --> 47:00.441
I'm not worried anymore,
I'm just pissed.

47:00.609 --> 47:01.984
Well, stop it.

47:09.326 --> 47:11.160
Look, why don't you take Tommy
with you?

47:11.328 --> 47:14.163
Probably do him good
to get him out of here for a while.

47:14.331 --> 47:16.624
Yeah, that's a good idea.

47:16.792 --> 47:20.711
Tommy? Pam's taking Reggie
to see his brother tonight.

47:20.879 --> 47:24.799
-Why don't you ride along with them?
-Yeah, great idea. Now, let's go.

47:27.386 --> 47:30.304
Why don't you go see
what you can do, huh?

47:30.472 --> 47:32.056
Okay.

47:32.224 --> 47:34.392
Tommy.

47:36.645 --> 47:38.479
Tommy.

47:41.441 --> 47:43.693
Come on. It'll be fun.

47:47.239 --> 47:49.156
Okay?

47:52.077 --> 47:53.369
Good.

48:58.185 --> 49:00.978
-Come on.
-No. I'll wait here.

49:01.146 --> 49:03.648
-Come on.
-I'm okay.

49:07.152 --> 49:08.235
Yo, Demon!

49:08.403 --> 49:10.613
That the big bad
wolf rapping at my door?

49:10.781 --> 49:12.490
Yeah, bro, it's me, it's me. Open up!

49:12.658 --> 49:15.368
- That you, Reckless?
- Open up the door!

49:16.912 --> 49:20.957
Oh, my God.
Well, get your ass in here, boy!

49:21.124 --> 49:25.127
God, it's good to see you, dude.
Damn, you look good!

49:25.295 --> 49:27.004
I know, I know. Heh.

49:27.172 --> 49:31.384
Oh, God. Look at this. God.
Hey, you had any dinner?

49:31.551 --> 49:35.054
Here. Have an enchilada. Man.

49:35.222 --> 49:37.682
Wow, man, where'd you get
those bad rings from?

49:37.849 --> 49:41.686
If you been around the world as long
as your big brother have, you get things.

49:43.772 --> 49:46.774
Freaking-A! Where'd you get that?

49:48.360 --> 49:49.776
Hey, calm down, dude.

49:49.802 --> 49:52.179
Hey, say hello to Anita.
She's my girlfriend.

49:52.322 --> 49:53.385
Hello, beautiful.

49:53.411 --> 49:56.350
Hey, little brother.
What's happening? Heh.

49:57.035 --> 49:59.120
Listen, I want you all to meet somebody.

49:59.287 --> 50:02.248
Hey, Pam.
Yo, Pam, come here, baby, come here.

50:02.416 --> 50:04.166
-This is my friend, Pam.
-Hi.

50:04.334 --> 50:06.502
She's my girlfriend.

50:07.754 --> 50:09.714
What's up, Pam?

50:22.477 --> 50:24.020
-Pam, you hungry?
-Oh, no, thanks.

50:24.187 --> 50:26.689
You want a taco? Egg roll?
What about a slice of pizza?

50:26.857 --> 50:29.191
-No, thank you.
-Cheese and sausage.

50:29.359 --> 50:31.444
What about you, brother?
I know what you want.

50:31.611 --> 50:33.112
-Want a beer?
-Yeah, I'll take--

50:33.280 --> 50:34.488
-Get out of here.
-Heh.

50:34.656 --> 50:38.075
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you take this?

50:38.243 --> 50:39.785
Wow.

50:39.953 --> 50:41.370
Hey, man, this is bad!

50:41.538 --> 50:44.206
Nothing is too good for
my little brother.

50:44.374 --> 50:45.958
You gonna give me this too?

51:26.583 --> 51:32.129
I got you, didn't I?
Really scared you, didn't I?

51:32.714 --> 51:35.257
Are you dumb or something?

51:41.223 --> 51:43.891
You a crazy from the loony bin!

51:46.269 --> 51:51.440
Oh, my mama's gonna chop you up
into itty-bitty pieces, my friend!

51:52.484 --> 51:56.445
You hear me? I said, are you hearing me?

51:57.781 --> 52:00.449
I said, are you hearing me?

52:01.952 --> 52:04.578
You fucking lunatic!

52:31.273 --> 52:33.649
Tommy!

52:44.578 --> 52:46.787
Reggie, we've gotta go now.

52:46.955 --> 52:49.957
-It's okay, bro. Take care, all right?
-Thanks for the dinner.

52:50.125 --> 52:52.042
-Anytime.
-Stay cool, baby.

52:53.461 --> 52:56.505
- Hey, stay safe, Reckless.
- I will.

53:07.392 --> 53:11.270
-You know, I miss him already.
-Yeah, he's a cutie-pie.

53:11.438 --> 53:13.230
-Wanna hit this?
-Yeah.

53:14.608 --> 53:16.233
What's wrong?

53:17.777 --> 53:21.697
-Hey, you okay?
-Ooh. It's them damn enchiladas.

53:23.450 --> 53:25.326
You gonna be all right?

53:52.604 --> 53:54.230
Who's that?

53:56.316 --> 53:57.858
Stop it!

53:59.069 --> 54:00.611
Stop it!

54:08.745 --> 54:10.454
You gonna get it, bitch!

54:11.414 --> 54:15.251
Oh, lighten up, Demon. You'll feel
a lot better after you shit. Heh.

54:15.418 --> 54:19.672
I'll feel a lot better when I'm out of here.
This shit box is gross!

54:19.839 --> 54:22.675
You better watch out for the snake
that's gonna crawl up that crapper...

54:22.842 --> 54:25.135
...and bite your ass, heh.

54:29.391 --> 54:31.225
<i>Ooh, baby</i>

54:31.393 --> 54:32.935
<i>Hey, baby</i>

54:33.645 --> 54:35.187
<i>Hey, baby</i>

54:36.106 --> 54:37.314
<i>Ooh, baby</i>

54:37.482 --> 54:40.359
<i>Ooh, baby, ooh, baby</i>

54:40.527 --> 54:43.279
<i>Ooh, baby, ooh, baby</i>

54:43.488 --> 54:45.406
<i>Hey, baby</i>

54:45.699 --> 54:46.907
<i>Hey, baby</i>

54:47.075 --> 54:49.910
<i>Ooh, baby, ooh, baby</i>

54:50.078 --> 54:52.913
<i>Ooh, baby, ooh, baby</i>

54:53.081 --> 54:54.415
<i>Ooh, baby, ooh--</i>

54:57.752 --> 55:02.089
Anita? Hey, girl, what's up?

55:11.141 --> 55:13.183
Hey!

55:13.810 --> 55:16.979
Okay. I told you this isn't funny.

55:17.981 --> 55:20.190
Now you gonna get it, bitch.

55:29.200 --> 55:31.285
Anita!

56:22.504 --> 56:25.464
Matt's gone. George too.

56:25.632 --> 56:27.841
- Are you sure?
- I looked everywhere.

56:28.009 --> 56:30.677
And Tina and Eddie
haven't come back either.

56:30.845 --> 56:35.265
-Where are they?
-Look, it's okay. Calm down, Jake.

56:35.433 --> 56:39.395
Let's try to take this slowly.
Where did Matt say he was going?

56:39.562 --> 56:42.189
- He didn't.
- Yes, he did.

56:42.357 --> 56:44.525
He said he was gonna go look
for Tina and Eddie.

56:44.692 --> 56:47.778
Where's Tommy?
I thought he was with you.

56:47.946 --> 56:50.989
-And where's Gramps?
-I don't know, Reggie.

56:52.534 --> 56:56.078
Look, why don't you all go inside?
I'm gonna go find everyone.

56:56.246 --> 56:59.540
-Jake, I'm putting you in charge.
-Yes.

57:00.250 --> 57:03.752
And you, little Reckless,
I want you in bed asleep...

57:03.920 --> 57:05.921
...by the time I get back, right?

57:06.089 --> 57:07.631
No problem.

57:07.799 --> 57:09.716
Okay.

57:38.663 --> 57:43.417
I'm making your dinner, Junior!
You hearing me, fella?

57:43.585 --> 57:47.421
He hurt me, Ma! Do you hear me?
They hurt me!

57:54.304 --> 57:56.805
I am making your dinner!

58:14.657 --> 58:19.203
They hurt me, Ma!
Will you murder them?

58:19.787 --> 58:24.541
Chop them and kill them! You hear me?

58:24.709 --> 58:27.753
Are you hearing me, boy?
Get off that fucking bike...

58:27.921 --> 58:29.838
...and come here and eat my stew!

58:44.229 --> 58:46.813
About time, you fuckwad.

58:49.067 --> 58:52.736
Knew you couldn't pass up on my stew.

58:56.616 --> 59:03.205
You hearing me, Junior?
You talk. You dumb?

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:26.496
<i>It's so lonely here.</i>

01:00:27.707 --> 01:00:30.334
<i>Like we were the only two people left</i>
<i>in the whole world.</i>

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:34.129
<i>Maybe we are.</i>

01:00:34.297 --> 01:00:37.883
<i>Maybe when we get back to shore,</i>
<i>everybody else will have disappeared.</i>

01:00:38.968 --> 01:00:40.677
<i>I'd like that. Wouldn't you?</i>

01:00:49.562 --> 01:00:51.313
Robin. Ahem.

01:00:53.358 --> 01:00:58.487
We've been here
nearly eight months now, right?

01:00:58.863 --> 01:01:00.072
Uh-huh.

01:01:01.699 --> 01:01:05.619
That's a long time to get to know
somebody, don't you think?

01:01:05.787 --> 01:01:06.828
Shh.

01:01:06.996 --> 01:01:09.748
-Jake, please.
-Sure, sure.

01:01:12.752 --> 01:01:14.586
<i>We could go
anywhere we wanted...</i>

01:01:14.754 --> 01:01:18.131
<i>...and we could live</i>
<i>in the biggest house in the world.</i>

01:01:18.299 --> 01:01:21.506
<i>Only, I'd like to live
in a little house.</i>

01:01:21.532 --> 01:01:24.204
<i>Just big enough for
the two of us.</i>

01:01:27.809 --> 01:01:30.727
<i>Only, there's gonna be</i>
<i>more than two of us, isn't there?</i>

01:01:39.028 --> 01:01:42.197
I like you, Robin.

01:01:43.741 --> 01:01:46.952
-A lot.
-And I like you too, Jake.

01:01:48.162 --> 01:01:51.581
You do? A lot?

01:01:53.126 --> 01:01:55.085
What are you talking about,
Jake?

01:01:55.253 --> 01:01:56.753
Uh....

01:02:01.676 --> 01:02:04.052
I wanna be with you.

01:02:04.512 --> 01:02:09.266
I really do wanna be with you.

01:02:10.393 --> 01:02:16.231
I wanna make love with you.

01:02:26.993 --> 01:02:29.953
-I can't....
-I didn't mean it.

01:02:31.205 --> 01:02:33.457
I didn't mean it.

01:02:37.545 --> 01:02:40.756
I said, I-- I didn't mean it!

01:03:16.250 --> 01:03:17.959
Vi?

01:03:20.922 --> 01:03:23.256
Vi!

01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:31.556
-Vi, I'd like to talk to you.
-Huh?

01:03:31.724 --> 01:03:36.061
-I need to talk to you.
-Can it wait?

01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:42.776
No.

01:04:15.309 --> 01:04:20.146
Reggie. Reggie? Come on.
Reggie, wake up.

01:04:20.314 --> 01:04:23.024
- Mm.
- Come on, it's time to go to bed.

01:04:23.192 --> 01:04:24.776
Reggie, wake up. Reggie!

01:04:30.992 --> 01:04:33.076
Okay, your way.

01:05:17.872 --> 01:05:20.582
Jake, I'm sorry.

01:05:21.584 --> 01:05:25.795
You know, sometimes, Robin,
you are just so stupid.

01:06:56.387 --> 01:07:01.516
<i>There was a man so cold</i>
<i>No life was in his eyes</i>

01:07:03.352 --> 01:07:08.857
<i>He had a look so hard</i>
<i>I'd never seen him smile</i>

01:07:12.319 --> 01:07:15.697
<i>I could've told you then</i>
<i>You'd heard it all before</i>

01:07:17.074 --> 01:07:22.537
<i>And now you're in suspense</i>
<i>You have to wait for more</i>

01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:29.711
<i>In all those mysteries</i>
<i>You're taken by surprise</i>

01:07:30.838 --> 01:07:36.760
<i>You never thought to see</i>
<i>That look was in his eyes</i>

01:07:39.055 --> 01:07:42.682
<i>There's a man with no
life in his eyes</i>

01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:49.647
<i>There's a man with no
life in his eyes</i>

01:08:21.846 --> 01:08:24.724
What are them nuts up to now?

01:08:54.546 --> 01:08:58.758
Yo, Tommy. You back?
Tommy, you in here?

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:05.765
Yo, Tommy.

01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:25.702
What is it, Reggie? It's Pam.
What's the matter? What's the matter?

01:09:25.870 --> 01:09:31.166
-It's me. What is it? What is it?
-In Tommy's room.

01:09:31.332 --> 01:09:37.130
Okay. All right. You stay here.
Relax. I'll be right back. Okay?

01:10:02.448 --> 01:10:04.073
Move!

01:10:05.159 --> 01:10:07.702
-Aah!
-Get up! Get up!

01:10:24.803 --> 01:10:26.596
Shit!

01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:33.061
Run! Come on! Let's go!

01:11:06.929 --> 01:11:09.013
Help us!

01:11:39.003 --> 01:11:43.298
Reggie! Reggie!

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:09.782
Pam, where are you?

01:12:12.328 --> 01:12:15.496
-Pam!
-Reggie!

01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:19.125
Reggie!

01:12:47.112 --> 01:12:50.365
Reggie! Reggie!

01:13:00.959 --> 01:13:03.044
Reggie.

01:13:45.504 --> 01:13:46.754
No! No!

01:13:53.846 --> 01:13:55.471
No!

01:14:46.190 --> 01:14:49.400
Oh, it's okay, Reggie.
It's okay. It's okay.

01:15:05.250 --> 01:15:07.126
God.

01:15:15.427 --> 01:15:17.470
Oh, God.

01:17:01.992 --> 01:17:03.993
Yeah! All right, Pam!

01:17:17.633 --> 01:17:19.300
Yeah!

01:18:01.343 --> 01:18:03.511
Tommy! Tommy!

01:18:23.615 --> 01:18:25.741
Run, Tommy, run!

01:18:26.785 --> 01:18:29.370
Run! He'll kill you!

01:18:29.538 --> 01:18:32.039
- Jason?
- Listen to me!

01:18:32.207 --> 01:18:35.209
Run! Go! Tommy, get out!

01:18:35.377 --> 01:18:36.794
- Jason?
- Get out!

01:18:36.962 --> 01:18:40.172
Listen! Oh, Tommy, go!

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:44.051
Please, Tommy!

01:18:44.886 --> 01:18:47.930
- Tommy!
- Remember.

01:18:49.349 --> 01:18:50.599
Don't.

01:18:53.603 --> 01:18:55.980
- Remember.
- Die!

01:18:56.148 --> 01:18:58.691
- Remember.
- Die!

01:18:58.859 --> 01:19:01.569
- Jason.
<i>- Remember, remember.</i>

01:19:01.737 --> 01:19:06.115
<i>- Remember, remember, remember....</i>
- Tommy! Tommy!

01:19:27.179 --> 01:19:30.264
Up here, Tommy! Come on! Up here!

01:19:30.432 --> 01:19:32.641
Come on! Come on.

01:19:32.809 --> 01:19:35.603
- Tommy, please!
- Come on, Tommy, up here!

01:19:35.771 --> 01:19:39.315
- Come on!
- Come on, hurry up!

01:19:39.483 --> 01:19:41.150
Tommy, hurry up!

01:19:41.318 --> 01:19:43.194
Come on, come on.

01:19:43.361 --> 01:19:46.489
Come on, Tommy, you can do it!
Come on, Tommy!

01:19:46.656 --> 01:19:49.909
- Tommy, please!
- Tommy, hurry up!

01:19:50.076 --> 01:19:52.453
Take my hand. Take my hand!

01:19:52.621 --> 01:19:54.455
Come on, yeah.

01:19:54.623 --> 01:19:57.583
- Come on, yeah.
- Just one more, Tommy. Come on.

01:20:03.799 --> 01:20:05.674
Come on, you can do it!

01:21:53.533 --> 01:21:55.159
No!

01:22:16.222 --> 01:22:19.934
Pam! No! Please help me!

01:22:24.773 --> 01:22:27.942
Please! Please, somebody help me! Pam!

01:22:29.986 --> 01:22:31.737
Help! Help!

01:22:31.905 --> 01:22:35.324
Help! Help! Please, help!

01:23:51.735 --> 01:23:53.527
How are you doing?

01:24:10.837 --> 01:24:13.213
Quite a kid.

01:24:16.718 --> 01:24:19.344
We found this on Roy.

01:24:20.221 --> 01:24:24.308
The kid who was axed to death
at the woodpile was Roy's son.

01:24:25.727 --> 01:24:30.981
God only knows why Roy kept it
hidden all these years, but he did.

01:24:31.858 --> 01:24:33.901
Roy was a real loner.

01:24:34.903 --> 01:24:39.990
Never talked much,
not even to the other paramedics.

01:24:43.703 --> 01:24:45.621
I guess when
he was called to the scene...

01:24:45.789 --> 01:24:49.333
...and he saw that it was his own Joey,
all hacked to pieces....

01:24:50.668 --> 01:24:52.753
Oh, God.

01:24:55.381 --> 01:24:57.633
We also found these.

01:25:03.223 --> 01:25:05.933
I guess he used the Jason thing...

01:25:07.227 --> 01:25:08.602
...to cover up with.

01:26:02.991 --> 01:26:04.825
Tommy.

01:26:21.801 --> 01:26:23.760
Hi.

01:28:55.455 --> 01:28:57.539
Oh, my God.
