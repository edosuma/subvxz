Subtitles by explosiveskull

02:24.231 --> 02:25.732
Are you okay?

02:32.572 --> 02:34.491
What do you think it's
gonna be like out there?

02:38.703 --> 02:40.996
It'll get back to normal.

02:40.998 --> 02:42.542
You'll see.

03:04.897 --> 03:06.566
How long
were you infected?

03:07.817 --> 03:10.025
Four years.

03:10.027 --> 03:11.985
Did you have to be
potty-trained again?

03:14.364 --> 03:16.033
Are you having
any violent impulses?

03:16.909 --> 03:17.827
No.

03:19.704 --> 03:21.413
Any nightmares?

03:24.209 --> 03:25.833
Good.

03:25.835 --> 03:28.543
They're there to remind
you what you did.

03:28.545 --> 03:29.629
The suffering you caused.

03:32.467 --> 03:35.884
The nightmares mean there might
be something human left.

03:35.886 --> 03:38.055
Makes you wonder about those
that don't have them, huh?

03:41.641 --> 03:43.141
You'll report to me
every week.

03:43.143 --> 03:44.935
Lateness will not
be tolerated.

03:44.937 --> 03:46.729
Skipping work
will not be tolerated.

03:46.731 --> 03:48.646
Anti-social behavior
will not be tolerated.

03:48.648 --> 03:49.898
Basically you do
what I say

03:49.900 --> 03:53.151
and your life will be..

03:53.153 --> 03:54.654
...better.

03:57.117 --> 03:59.993
Your sister-in-law,
Abigail Reynolds

03:59.995 --> 04:01.786
has agreed
to take you in.

04:02.955 --> 04:04.287
I didn't put
in a request.

04:04.289 --> 04:06.206
Charlie Three Three Bravo,
this is..

04:06.208 --> 04:09.459
Not everyone gets
to go home, Senan.

04:09.461 --> 04:10.543
You should be grateful.

04:10.545 --> 04:12.631
Bus ready to depart. Out.

04:15.050 --> 04:16.548
Close the gate.

04:16.551 --> 04:18.301
Delta Echo One Zero.

04:18.303 --> 04:21.221
Bus passes,
checkpoint four. Over.

04:21.224 --> 04:22.515
Charlie Three Three Bravo

04:22.517 --> 04:24.182
this is Charlie
Two One Alpha.

04:24.184 --> 04:25.226
- The last bus is loading.
- Get on the bus quickly.

04:25.228 --> 04:26.394
- Ready the gate. Over.
- Single file.

04:26.396 --> 04:27.685
Take your seats.

04:27.687 --> 04:29.355
Charlie Three Three Alpha.

04:29.357 --> 04:31.651
Transport departing
in two minutes. Out.

04:37.572 --> 04:39.240
The cure was supposed to
be some sort of great hope

04:39.242 --> 04:40.658
but things are
just gettin' worse.

04:40.660 --> 04:42.743
That's not fair.
My daughter was released.

04:42.745 --> 04:44.662
Whatever she did she can't
hurt anyone anymore.

04:44.664 --> 04:45.997
People need to give
them a second chance.

04:45.999 --> 04:48.081
We've given them
every chance.

04:48.083 --> 04:50.418
They're not integrating. No
wonder crime's on the rise.

04:50.420 --> 04:52.085
They're not
like us anymore.

04:52.087 --> 04:53.962
They would if they were
given some choices

04:53.964 --> 04:55.298
instead of being treated like
they were still infected.

04:55.300 --> 04:57.300
Have you seen the news?
The violence?

04:57.302 --> 04:58.927
The vandalism? There's
something wrong with them.

04:58.929 --> 05:00.136
They're not human.

05:01.556 --> 05:03.471
They don't, they don't
have a worry.

05:03.473 --> 05:04.640
They're just scum.

05:12.400 --> 05:14.607
Scumbags! Murderers!

05:14.609 --> 05:17.946
Scum! Scum! Scum!

05:17.948 --> 05:20.488
Welcome to the
accommodation center.

05:21.826 --> 05:23.826
For those of
you going home

05:23.828 --> 05:25.994
please make your way
to the left.

05:25.996 --> 05:27.996
Which is my right.

05:27.998 --> 05:29.958
Make your way
to my right.

05:29.960 --> 05:31.167
Which is your left.

05:31.169 --> 05:33.251
Left is home.

05:33.253 --> 05:34.671
Senan.

05:36.506 --> 05:37.881
You're not human!

05:37.883 --> 05:39.550
You're not human!

05:43.056 --> 05:44.390
Don't tell her.

05:52.522 --> 05:54.732
We need to look out for
each other out here, okay?

05:59.364 --> 06:02.365
Keep it moving, people.
Thank you.

06:02.367 --> 06:04.034
Through that door,
please.

06:06.579 --> 06:09.747
Don't stop. Keep going,
please. Through the door.

06:17.757 --> 06:19.923
What are your thoughts on the
release of the Third Wave?

06:19.925 --> 06:21.259
I think we can't
take any more.

06:21.261 --> 06:23.094
I think the First Wave

06:23.096 --> 06:24.427
and the Second Wave

06:24.429 --> 06:27.805
have been
a fucking disaster.

06:27.807 --> 06:29.432
No one wants them here.

06:29.434 --> 06:31.809
Not much against them.
Just... just no craic.

06:31.811 --> 06:32.810
- Yeah.
- You know what I mean?

06:32.812 --> 06:34.230
They just mope around.

06:34.232 --> 06:35.313
Bit of a hum
off them, to be honest.

06:39.612 --> 06:40.653
Oh, shit!

06:40.655 --> 06:42.655
My uncle came back
in the First Wave.

06:42.657 --> 06:44.657
And how is he now?

06:44.659 --> 06:46.449
He killed himself
last year.

06:46.451 --> 06:48.995
UN's pullin' out. Who the
fuck is gonna stay put?

06:48.997 --> 06:50.328
They're out there,
right now.

06:50.330 --> 06:52.455
Infected, Cured,
they're all the same.

06:52.457 --> 06:54.332
Wipe the fuckin' lot of them
out, that's what I say.

06:54.334 --> 06:56.169
The government now face
a very difficult dilemma

06:56.171 --> 06:59.130
of what to do with
the 25% of infected

06:59.132 --> 07:00.423
who remain resistant
to the cure.

07:00.425 --> 07:02.966
I mean, what they did..
I mean..

07:02.968 --> 07:04.677
How do you get over that?

07:04.679 --> 07:06.014
Repent!

07:11.394 --> 07:12.812
Repent!

07:14.564 --> 07:16.147
Hop on.

07:16.149 --> 07:18.524
Ready, activate. Go!

07:18.526 --> 07:19.986
Whoosh!

07:23.573 --> 07:25.240
Is this it? Is this
all your homework?

07:27.702 --> 07:29.660
Hmm. Great job.

07:31.746 --> 07:32.705
You don't even need me.

07:45.095 --> 07:46.261
Hi.

07:54.394 --> 07:55.981
I don't have to stay.

07:59.067 --> 08:01.111
It's what.. It's what
Luke would have wanted.

08:05.280 --> 08:08.450
Besides... technically
it's your house.

08:11.621 --> 08:13.121
It hasn't changed at all.

08:13.123 --> 08:15.957
I was... gonna hire

08:15.959 --> 08:18.166
an interior designer,
but, um..

08:18.168 --> 08:20.168
They all got eaten.

08:30.514 --> 08:31.807
Sorry.

08:35.686 --> 08:37.852
I thought that maybe if you made
it you would have gone home.

08:37.854 --> 08:39.897
Cillian was born here.

08:39.899 --> 08:42.734
And only uninfected US
nationals are considered.

08:45.530 --> 08:46.907
I guess we're a risk.

08:51.077 --> 08:52.578
Did they give you a job?

08:53.914 --> 08:55.579
There was a..

08:55.581 --> 08:57.497
...an opening
at the treatment center.

08:57.499 --> 08:59.169
Why would you
wanna stay there?

09:02.923 --> 09:05.423
It's just being
a porter again.

09:05.425 --> 09:07.384
Luke always said you were
wasting your time with that.

09:21.899 --> 09:23.899
Were you with him?

09:23.901 --> 09:25.277
At the end?

09:29.656 --> 09:30.991
We got separated.

09:42.253 --> 09:44.172
You wanna go say hi?

09:49.760 --> 09:50.845
Hey.

10:12.033 --> 10:13.701
Are you one
of the Cured?

10:18.080 --> 10:19.249
Yeah.

10:22.334 --> 10:24.254
Will you be sick again?

10:30.592 --> 10:31.927
I don't think so.

10:36.432 --> 10:38.351
Is it nice to be back?

10:43.523 --> 10:46.567
Yeah. It is.

11:11.592 --> 11:13.676
Make your way to the
nearest evacuation point.

11:15.346 --> 11:18.263
- Abbie! Abbie!
- Even if a loved one.

11:18.265 --> 11:20.015
Make your way to the nearest
evacuation point.

11:20.017 --> 11:20.934
Luke.

11:20.936 --> 11:22.019
Luke!

11:22.979 --> 11:24.189
We have to go.

11:27.483 --> 11:28.776
Abbie knows what to do.

11:39.661 --> 11:40.705
No!

11:43.333 --> 11:44.584
Senan!

11:45.417 --> 11:46.584
Run!

11:46.586 --> 11:48.043
Run!

12:16.532 --> 12:17.907
Do you have
what it takes to join

12:17.909 --> 12:19.408
the Irish Defense
Volunteers?

12:19.410 --> 12:20.575
Well, call..

12:36.468 --> 12:37.762
Hi, Dad.

12:42.224 --> 12:44.351
They have me working
as a cleaner.

12:45.686 --> 12:47.188
It's ridiculous.

12:50.482 --> 12:52.525
I thought maybe..

12:52.527 --> 12:54.361
...you could put in a good
word at some firms you know.

12:55.947 --> 12:57.698
Get me back
in the courtroom.

13:00.201 --> 13:01.702
Please, Dad.

13:02.619 --> 13:03.954
Mum wouldn't want this.

13:05.872 --> 13:07.832
Don't you dare
mention her.

13:09.794 --> 13:11.712
I saw what you did to her.

13:13.089 --> 13:14.257
You're a monster.

13:15.091 --> 13:16.217
Dad..

13:56.924 --> 13:58.423
This is Foxtrot
Sierra Nine Two.

13:58.425 --> 14:00.595
There's been another
attack on a Cured. Over.

14:02.347 --> 14:04.263
November Oscar 64

14:04.265 --> 14:05.764
this is
Papa Golf Twenty-Two.

14:05.766 --> 14:07.852
Perimeter is secure. Out.

14:22.699 --> 14:24.284
Twenty-six, seven..

14:27.872 --> 14:29.704
Sierra Two One,
UN withdrawal

14:29.706 --> 14:31.501
commencing at
1400 hours.

14:40.635 --> 14:42.137
You're over there.

15:46.658 --> 15:48.328
You must be the help.

15:49.996 --> 15:51.829
She one of the Resistant?

15:51.831 --> 15:53.663
What do you think?

15:56.543 --> 15:58.213
Do you have any
medical training?

16:00.047 --> 16:01.546
I was a porter.

16:01.548 --> 16:03.132
Jesus Christ!

16:03.134 --> 16:04.049
They take away
my staff and give me

16:04.051 --> 16:06.676
a fucking trolley pusher.

16:06.678 --> 16:08.803
Hold her arm.

16:08.805 --> 16:11.141
Are you here to help me or not?
Hold her fucking arm!

16:27.617 --> 16:29.119
Good girl.

16:32.788 --> 16:35.289
She's not attackin' me.

16:35.291 --> 16:38.251
It's the same reason you
can't get chicken pox twice.

16:38.253 --> 16:40.630
Once infected, your cells retain
a trace of the Maze virus.

16:42.965 --> 16:44.634
She thinks
you're one of them.

16:48.804 --> 16:51.639
- Where are the others?
- I don't have access any more.

16:51.641 --> 16:53.559
They've allowed me to
continue caring for her.

16:56.562 --> 16:58.273
She's all that matters.

16:59.481 --> 17:01.150
We have to cure her.

17:20.669 --> 17:23.045
How could you
take one in? Huh?

17:23.047 --> 17:24.337
Please, this
isn't the place.

17:24.339 --> 17:25.548
They're murderers,
the lot of them.

17:25.550 --> 17:26.839
Come on, love,
now's not the time.

17:26.840 --> 17:27.884
Back off.

17:27.886 --> 17:29.177
Murderers!

17:51.284 --> 17:53.451
Can I make Senan
lunch tomorrow?

17:53.453 --> 17:54.867
What do you
wanna make him?

17:54.869 --> 17:56.413
If it's peanut butter
and chocolate chip..

17:59.459 --> 18:01.294
...and I'm gonna
cut it in half.

18:50.050 --> 18:52.718
Despite condemnation
from around the world

18:52.720 --> 18:54.220
the Irish government
will commence

18:54.222 --> 18:57.891
the humane elimination
of the resistant 25%.

18:57.893 --> 19:00.183
The Taoiseach has called
it an act of mercy

19:00.185 --> 19:02.645
insisting the hope
of refining the cure

19:02.647 --> 19:04.232
is no longer a reality.

19:04.900 --> 19:06.482
You.

19:06.484 --> 19:07.483
- Hmm?
- You.

19:07.485 --> 19:08.816
- He's the king.
- Gosh.

19:08.818 --> 19:10.861
Can't we work
together, maybe?

19:10.863 --> 19:11.988
Okay.

19:11.990 --> 19:13.074
Cool.

19:21.291 --> 19:23.581
I was in prison.
This is worse.

19:23.583 --> 19:26.419
We're treated
like lepers.

19:26.421 --> 19:28.296
It's right that
they're scared, though.

19:28.298 --> 19:29.462
I mean.. What we did..

19:29.464 --> 19:30.798
Why?

19:30.800 --> 19:33.134
Why is it right
that they're scared?

19:33.136 --> 19:34.635
They're not
the ones living here

19:34.637 --> 19:36.431
having their every
move monitored.

19:37.640 --> 19:39.222
We need to march.

19:39.224 --> 19:41.393
We need to stand up
and say..

19:49.985 --> 19:51.444
You didn't tell her.

19:56.491 --> 19:59.242
You were right to lie.

19:59.244 --> 20:02.288
They're all the same when
they know the truth.

20:02.290 --> 20:03.871
They just want us
to continue

20:03.873 --> 20:06.292
killing ourselves,
and solve the problem..

20:06.294 --> 20:07.628
Did you see them?

20:11.049 --> 20:13.381
The Resistant
don't attack us.

20:15.510 --> 20:18.054
They think
we're still infected.

20:18.056 --> 20:19.724
What does that mean?

20:23.894 --> 20:25.730
Means we're safer
with them than the rest.

20:31.569 --> 20:32.695
Move.

20:50.295 --> 20:51.964
You've been
skippin' work.

20:54.634 --> 20:56.134
I'm not a cleaner.

21:01.266 --> 21:03.141
You know..

21:03.143 --> 21:05.558
...I knew people
like you..

21:05.560 --> 21:07.936
...before the outbreak.

21:07.938 --> 21:10.606
They thought the world
was theirs on a platter.

21:10.608 --> 21:12.650
Lookin' down on
the rest of us.

21:12.652 --> 21:14.612
But here... now..

21:15.906 --> 21:18.114
...I'm in charge.

21:18.116 --> 21:20.576
I decide whether your life
is happy or miserable.

21:22.662 --> 21:24.747
You just have to
learn to obey.

21:29.127 --> 21:31.129
- Is that it?
- No.

21:37.342 --> 21:39.887
Stop harassing
your family.

21:42.222 --> 21:44.515
They don't want you back.

21:46.561 --> 21:48.476
Get the fuck back.

21:58.738 --> 22:00.781
It's not your world
any more.

22:46.829 --> 22:48.248
He's awake!

23:05.180 --> 23:06.641
It's just kids.

23:08.683 --> 23:10.393
We've been through worse.

23:15.483 --> 23:17.358
They suit you.

23:17.360 --> 23:18.904
His clothes.

23:22.532 --> 23:23.907
Where were you
last night?

23:23.909 --> 23:25.868
I had to go see
a friend.

23:28.203 --> 23:29.579
I have to go.

23:34.544 --> 23:36.044
Smile, Cillian.

23:36.046 --> 23:37.335
- We love you, ma.
- Smile!

23:44.012 --> 23:45.011
- Hi.
- Hm.

23:45.013 --> 23:46.679
He suits you, yeah?

23:46.681 --> 23:47.933
- Yeah!
- Cute.

23:49.184 --> 23:50.641
Oh, my God, that
toy is gonna be

23:50.643 --> 23:52.435
the death of me.

23:52.437 --> 23:54.727
- It's trippy, isn't it?
- It is a bit, yeah.

23:58.108 --> 23:59.400
Abbie. How's it going?

23:59.402 --> 24:00.944
Did you get my footage?

24:00.946 --> 24:02.445
The withdrawal's
started already

24:02.447 --> 24:04.322
whatever talks they're
having are bullshit.

24:04.324 --> 24:06.282
Yeah, yeah, I got it,
but look, um..

24:06.284 --> 24:08.741
It's just not a story of
interest for us right now.

24:08.743 --> 24:10.661
No, it's too soon,
I'm telling you

24:10.663 --> 24:11.995
the country isn't ready.

24:11.997 --> 24:13.456
The Resistant
are still alive

24:13.458 --> 24:15.123
it's not safe yet.

24:15.125 --> 24:16.960
Tell that to
the families here.

24:16.962 --> 24:18.794
Look, I... I do have
something for you to cover.

24:18.796 --> 24:20.628
The first McDonalds
is reopening.

24:20.630 --> 24:21.923
I need some coverage.

24:21.925 --> 24:23.506
If it's beneath you,
I can..

24:23.508 --> 24:26.344
Despite protests,
the humane elimination

24:26.346 --> 24:29.180
of the resistant 25%
is now under way

24:29.182 --> 24:30.513
with the military
estimating it will be

24:30.515 --> 24:32.683
completed by the end
of the week.

24:47.157 --> 24:48.158
Abbie.

24:51.329 --> 24:53.371
Sorry, I'm a friend
of Senan's.

24:53.373 --> 24:54.872
From quarantine?

24:54.874 --> 24:56.001
What gave it away?

24:57.835 --> 25:00.088
I was working
and I just saw you.

25:01.922 --> 25:03.590
Anyway, it's nice
to finally meet you.

25:07.677 --> 25:09.346
Was Senan with
you last night?

25:15.103 --> 25:16.852
It must have been tough.

25:16.854 --> 25:18.940
Raising a child alone
through the outbreak.

25:19.564 --> 25:21.064
I managed.

25:21.066 --> 25:23.151
Of course.

25:23.153 --> 25:25.653
I didn't mean
anything by it.

25:25.655 --> 25:27.782
I'm sorry.
It's just force of habit.

25:30.994 --> 25:33.244
I guess being a cleaner wasn't
your top career choice, huh?

25:33.246 --> 25:34.289
No.

25:35.165 --> 25:37.498
I'm a barrister.

25:37.500 --> 25:40.333
I was actually running for
election before all this.

25:40.335 --> 25:41.503
Well, maybe you can
run again.

25:42.255 --> 25:43.506
No, I doubt it.

25:44.839 --> 25:46.508
It's nice
to have your vote.

25:48.678 --> 25:50.345
How did you get that?

25:51.181 --> 25:52.845
This?

25:52.847 --> 25:54.599
Um, I was late for work.

25:56.311 --> 25:59.020
You have to complain.

25:59.022 --> 26:01.524
The guy we complain to has a
pretty decent right hook.

26:07.862 --> 26:10.238
What was it like?

26:10.240 --> 26:11.366
Quarantine?

26:13.203 --> 26:14.412
No, before that.

26:16.539 --> 26:18.208
Why don't you ask Senan?

26:19.749 --> 26:21.168
I can't.

26:25.255 --> 26:27.174
Everyone says it's hell.

26:30.845 --> 26:33.348
It's like being trapped
inside your body.

26:34.849 --> 26:36.516
Fighting to stop yourself.

26:38.436 --> 26:41.269
But what they
don't talk about..

26:41.271 --> 26:42.940
...is the moment
when you stop fighting.

26:45.235 --> 26:47.237
When you start to
just go with it.

26:59.832 --> 27:02.127
Gosh, I have to
get back to work.

27:06.089 --> 27:07.340
Thank you.

27:09.634 --> 27:11.092
For what?

27:11.094 --> 27:12.762
For not treating me
like an animal.

27:15.015 --> 27:16.932
Senan's very lucky
to have you.

27:49.007 --> 27:51.089
Nerve degradation
remains the same.

27:51.091 --> 27:53.384
Subject 301 shows
no sign of change.

27:53.386 --> 27:54.592
Recommend
upping the percentage

27:54.594 --> 27:56.513
of Bendamustine
in the formula.

27:58.348 --> 28:00.683
Sometimes I feel it.

28:00.685 --> 28:01.935
Screaming to get out.

28:01.937 --> 28:03.519
The cure prevents

28:03.521 --> 28:05.688
reinfection
or transmission.

28:05.690 --> 28:07.357
You're one of
the lucky ones.

28:31.925 --> 28:34.132
They were never gonna
keep the Resistant alive

28:34.134 --> 28:35.927
with the
withdrawal happening.

28:35.929 --> 28:38.179
We have to do something
to stop them.

28:38.181 --> 28:40.850
- Now.
- We need to target the IDV.

29:52.297 --> 29:53.631
Fuckin' screamers.

29:56.509 --> 29:58.801
Hey, what the fuck
are you doing?

29:58.803 --> 30:00.805
- Prick.
- Nick, I need help here!

30:03.016 --> 30:04.684
- You're one of them.
- Aah!

30:10.190 --> 30:11.189
Shit!

30:39.052 --> 30:41.221
Squadron Eight.
Perimeter clear.

30:46.935 --> 30:48.853
They're gonna die anyway.

31:07.913 --> 31:11.207
Cured rights now!
Cured rights now!

31:11.209 --> 31:12.916
Cured rights now!

31:18.591 --> 31:20.133
The truth is
that every day

31:20.135 --> 31:21.467
that the Resistant
remain alive

31:21.469 --> 31:23.594
is a day that we risk
another outbreak.

31:23.596 --> 31:26.179
But I can find a cure.

31:26.181 --> 31:29.017
I just need time
and resources.

31:29.019 --> 31:31.809
We have a stretched
medical system.

31:31.811 --> 31:33.146
We have to redirect
our efforts

31:33.148 --> 31:34.812
back to the populace.

31:34.814 --> 31:36.439
You're talking
about killing

31:36.441 --> 31:38.360
almost 5000 people.

31:40.320 --> 31:43.864
Joan... I fear
your personal loss

31:43.866 --> 31:46.659
has clouded your judgment.

31:46.661 --> 31:49.827
But I would ask you,
and indeed all those

31:49.829 --> 31:51.539
with loved ones
amongst the Resistant

31:51.541 --> 31:52.999
do you really want them
to live

31:53.001 --> 31:55.793
as these monsters
forever?

31:55.795 --> 31:57.712
They won't stop
with the Resistant.

31:59.674 --> 32:01.551
They want us all dead.

32:04.679 --> 32:06.139
We have to stop them.

32:58.648 --> 32:59.942
Senan. Senan.

33:02.862 --> 33:04.114
They're all empty targets.

33:05.530 --> 33:07.367
I promise you no one
will get hurt.

34:00.045 --> 34:01.960
- Hello.
- Hey, there's been a series of bombings.

34:01.962 --> 34:03.296
- How many?
- They're reporting five.

34:03.298 --> 34:04.881
Okay. Okay, just, uh..

34:04.883 --> 34:07.048
I have to drop off my son.
Give me 30 minutes.

34:07.050 --> 34:09.385
Cillian?
Cillian, let's go.

34:12.098 --> 34:13.224
Senan?

34:17.103 --> 34:18.980
Cured en route.

34:19.772 --> 34:22.106
Understood.

34:22.108 --> 34:24.150
There have been several
injured and one dead.

34:24.152 --> 34:27.235
The targets were the homes
of Irish Defense Volunteers.

34:27.237 --> 34:29.946
The Cured Alliance have claimed
responsibility for the attacks.

34:29.947 --> 34:31.489
The government have
insisted that they are

34:31.492 --> 34:33.034
a terrorist
organization.

34:33.036 --> 34:34.534
It's several weeks now
since the..

34:34.536 --> 34:37.621
Squadron Eight.
Perimeter clear.

34:37.623 --> 34:40.623
Cured rights now!
Cured rights now!

34:40.626 --> 34:42.208
Calm down, will you?
Get in the car!

34:42.210 --> 34:44.670
Get in the fuckin' car!
Calm down! Get in the car.

34:44.672 --> 34:47.630
Cured rights now!
Cured rights now!

34:47.632 --> 34:51.010
Cured rights now!
Cured rights now!

34:51.012 --> 34:54.388
Cured rights now!
Cured rights now!

34:54.389 --> 34:57.558
Cured rights now!
Cured rights now!

34:57.560 --> 34:58.642
Cured rights now!

35:15.078 --> 35:16.371
Senan.

35:17.205 --> 35:19.207
Senan, it's me. Please.

35:22.293 --> 35:23.586
Senan, please.

35:26.797 --> 35:28.049
Senan..

35:29.885 --> 35:32.303
Senan, please!
Please, Senan!

35:42.480 --> 35:44.399
No! Stop!

35:45.650 --> 35:46.943
Please!

35:54.409 --> 35:55.824
I know it's been hard
for you all

35:55.826 --> 35:58.661
being beaten and bullied
and forgotten.

35:58.663 --> 36:00.496
There's no one
looking out for us

36:00.498 --> 36:02.206
but I promise
that ends now.

36:02.208 --> 36:04.000
Today will be
the first day

36:04.002 --> 36:05.877
on the road
to our freedom.

36:05.879 --> 36:07.711
Whoo! Yeah!

36:07.713 --> 36:09.465
- Yes!
- Whoo!

36:38.578 --> 36:40.246
You know we found
the cure together?

36:42.165 --> 36:43.917
You can't imagine
the excitement.

36:46.252 --> 36:48.046
Later we realized that..

36:50.966 --> 36:53.466
...the subject remembered

36:53.468 --> 36:55.428
what they did
when infected.

37:00.058 --> 37:01.309
Was it worth it?

37:02.978 --> 37:04.645
After everything
we've done?

37:07.107 --> 37:09.109
You weren't in control,
you were just sick.

37:18.159 --> 37:19.660
We cured you.

37:23.498 --> 37:25.166
You get to choose
who you want to be.

37:28.586 --> 37:30.044
Does puppy's baby
have a name?

37:30.046 --> 37:33.047
Uh... Andrew.

37:33.049 --> 37:34.465
- Andrew?
- Yeah.

37:34.467 --> 37:36.175
I'm just making up..

37:36.177 --> 37:38.302
I'm just making up
normal names.

37:38.304 --> 37:39.222
Mm.

37:46.854 --> 37:48.648
Are you involved
with the Cured Alliance?

37:50.650 --> 37:51.567
No.

37:52.652 --> 37:54.570
So where do you go
at night?

37:56.239 --> 37:57.908
I don't want to
get in your way.

38:14.715 --> 38:17.052
There was so much chaos
after the Outbreak.

38:19.220 --> 38:22.307
It was two years before we could
begin to re-enter the city.

38:27.478 --> 38:29.940
We started to hear
a rumor of a cure.

38:35.111 --> 38:38.656
I actually convinced myself
that Luke was infected.

38:42.160 --> 38:45.621
Just... waiting
to be rescued.

38:54.797 --> 38:56.299
And then I came home.

39:00.678 --> 39:02.763
I thought they'd cleared
the entire city.

39:07.643 --> 39:10.063
The smell hit me first.

39:16.402 --> 39:17.570
Luke's gone.

39:19.572 --> 39:21.489
We're your family.

39:21.491 --> 39:22.575
Abbie..

39:25.411 --> 39:26.412
Mom?

39:29.415 --> 39:30.708
Hey, sweetie.

39:38.091 --> 39:39.759
How far outside the city
can we go?

40:29.309 --> 40:31.436
Me and your dad used to come
here when we were kids.

40:39.319 --> 40:40.987
It's as if
nothing happened.

40:49.079 --> 40:50.536
Liar, liar,
pants on fire.

40:50.538 --> 40:52.330
- What's her name?
- What?

40:52.332 --> 40:54.582
What's her name?

40:54.584 --> 40:55.749
Beatrice.

40:55.751 --> 40:57.418
Don't get me started
on this.

40:58.546 --> 41:00.171
Yeah.

41:00.173 --> 41:01.839
Then what we doing
with them?

41:03.927 --> 41:05.011
I'll get it.

41:05.595 --> 41:07.511
What's that?

41:07.513 --> 41:09.097
We were just
having dinner.

41:09.099 --> 41:10.598
I won't stay long.

41:14.729 --> 41:15.897
Take a seat.

41:20.735 --> 41:22.568
Hello.

41:22.570 --> 41:24.278
Hi.

41:24.280 --> 41:26.072
I'm Conor.

41:26.074 --> 41:27.615
I'm a friend
of your uncle's.

41:27.617 --> 41:29.077
Cillian, bedtime.

41:30.661 --> 41:31.913
Now, please.

41:39.670 --> 41:41.420
He's a good-looking boy.

41:41.422 --> 41:43.672
I can see
the resemblance.

41:43.674 --> 41:46.300
I called earlier,
but you weren't in.

41:46.302 --> 41:48.302
Where did you go?

41:48.304 --> 41:49.512
Killiney Hill.

41:49.514 --> 41:51.307
Oh. Nice.

41:52.683 --> 41:55.268
It's good to
see you bonding.

41:55.270 --> 41:58.938
It must be tough at the accommodation
center after the bombing.

41:58.940 --> 42:00.689
At least they
arrested someone.

42:00.691 --> 42:02.691
She didn't act alone.

42:02.693 --> 42:05.987
Well, there's a lot of
anger out there, you know?

42:05.989 --> 42:08.656
Particularly
with the Elimination.

42:08.658 --> 42:10.326
Maybe it's for the best.

42:12.078 --> 42:14.203
Dr. Lyons will
find a cure.

42:14.205 --> 42:16.664
- And what if she can't?
- She needs time.

42:16.666 --> 42:19.750
And one of them gets out, and...
and we're right back there.

42:19.752 --> 42:20.709
We're all in danger.

42:20.711 --> 42:22.755
Not all of us.

42:25.926 --> 42:29.429
It's late.
You need to go.

42:33.934 --> 42:35.851
Can I ask you something?

42:38.271 --> 42:40.440
Do you think
we deserve forgiveness?

42:42.567 --> 42:44.901
Yes.

42:44.903 --> 42:47.072
And if you were faced with the
man that killed your husband..

42:49.324 --> 42:50.909
...would you forgive him?

42:57.165 --> 42:58.791
They weren't in control.

43:00.751 --> 43:01.792
I'd better check
on Cillian.

43:01.794 --> 43:03.419
I'm sorry.

43:03.421 --> 43:05.090
I didn't mean to
upset you.

43:07.758 --> 43:08.676
You didn't.

43:23.524 --> 43:25.691
She takes you in and suddenly
you forget about us?

43:25.693 --> 43:28.861
You told me
they were empty targets.

43:28.863 --> 43:32.698
There's always
casualties, Senan.

43:32.700 --> 43:34.202
We're dying every day
because of them.

43:37.413 --> 43:39.082
I'm not gonna be
a part of this anymore.

43:40.333 --> 43:41.707
I have to look after them.

43:41.709 --> 43:43.042
You think you can
just shut the door

43:43.044 --> 43:44.921
and pretend it's all okay?

43:48.049 --> 43:51.219
You're the reason...
they're not safe.

43:58.935 --> 44:00.603
They'll find out
eventually.

44:26.629 --> 44:28.004
Sweetheart, can you go
and brush your teeth?

44:28.006 --> 44:29.755
I'm gonna be late.

44:29.757 --> 44:31.966
Cillian, now!

44:31.968 --> 44:33.636
I can take him to school.

44:35.346 --> 44:37.513
Uh, you don't know
where it is.

44:37.515 --> 44:38.975
I can show him.

44:40.936 --> 44:42.851
Okay.

44:42.853 --> 44:44.940
Okay, but straight
to school, okay?

44:51.362 --> 44:53.196
- Aah..
- Fall off.

44:53.198 --> 44:54.699
I'd never fall off.

45:02.123 --> 45:04.334
- Aah..
- Yeah.

45:11.257 --> 45:14.592
I just wanted to check to make
sure that he wasn't late.

45:14.594 --> 45:16.928
Yes, thank you. Bye.

45:21.851 --> 45:23.226
What's this about?

45:23.228 --> 45:25.436
It's customary to check in
with families

45:25.438 --> 45:26.356
to see
how everything's going.

45:28.399 --> 45:32.276
So, how is Senan
settling back in?

45:32.278 --> 45:34.112
Well.

45:34.114 --> 45:36.616
It's natural for there
to be problems at first.

45:38.409 --> 45:39.911
Everything's fine.

45:42.122 --> 45:44.582
You know, I have to say..

45:46.251 --> 45:48.918
...I think it's brave
of you

45:48.920 --> 45:50.753
to take one back in.

45:50.755 --> 45:53.297
Especially with a young
boy in the house.

45:53.299 --> 45:55.508
They can be aggressive.

45:55.510 --> 45:56.968
And it probably
doesn't help that their

45:56.970 --> 45:58.596
rehab officer kicks
the shit out of them.

46:00.515 --> 46:03.141
You've met Conor.

46:03.143 --> 46:04.644
The alpha of the pack.

46:06.021 --> 46:09.772
They're friends.
From quarantine.

46:09.774 --> 46:11.359
Is that
what they told you?

46:20.618 --> 46:22.368
We try to make ourselves
feel better

46:22.370 --> 46:25.538
feel safe, by saying
it wasn't their fault.

46:25.540 --> 46:27.500
They're just
mindless monsters.

46:29.377 --> 46:31.046
But the Infected
aren't mindless.

46:33.048 --> 46:34.964
They hunt together.

46:34.966 --> 46:36.507
They communicate
with each other.

46:36.509 --> 46:39.010
They decide who to kill..

46:39.012 --> 46:40.596
...and who to infect.

46:44.059 --> 46:46.727
They're connected in a way
that we will never understand.

46:49.064 --> 46:50.690
What do you want from me?

46:52.400 --> 46:54.235
I want you to contact me.

46:56.362 --> 46:58.031
If you think there's
anything I should know.

48:39.549 --> 48:40.798
They're killing
the Resistant

48:40.800 --> 48:42.884
because they think
they're a threat.

48:42.886 --> 48:44.969
But they're not
a threat to us.

48:44.971 --> 48:46.932
They're the key
to our freedom.

48:48.766 --> 48:51.059
Now, we're not gonna change
anything by simply crying

48:51.061 --> 48:53.477
and breaking windows
like petulant teenagers.

48:53.479 --> 48:55.646
We need something that
will make them listen.

48:55.648 --> 48:57.106
Something they're truly
scared of.

48:57.108 --> 48:59.358
- Yes! Yes!
- This is our country too.

48:59.360 --> 49:00.693
- Yes. Yes.
- Yes!

49:07.077 --> 49:07.953
Katie.

49:24.344 --> 49:26.135
What are you doing here?

49:26.137 --> 49:27.805
I wanted to see it
for myself.

49:30.058 --> 49:31.726
I thought you might've
come to see me.

49:37.983 --> 49:39.650
Do you want to
ask me something?

49:41.027 --> 49:43.361
You were involved
in the bombings.

49:43.363 --> 49:45.363
You can't link me
to any violence.

49:45.365 --> 49:46.447
So you're denying it?

49:46.449 --> 49:48.241
All I've done is
tried to help people.

49:48.243 --> 49:49.911
It's not just
for the power then?

49:52.122 --> 49:53.748
Now, look at
how they treat us.

49:55.291 --> 49:56.707
Look at how we're
forced to live

49:56.709 --> 49:58.376
what choice do we have?

49:58.378 --> 50:00.962
You have the choice
not to eat people.

50:00.964 --> 50:02.883
Well, there's the thing.

50:04.050 --> 50:05.758
We're not
the only killers.

50:05.760 --> 50:07.470
We're just the ones
being reminded of it.

50:09.305 --> 50:11.057
I want you to stay away
from me.

50:12.976 --> 50:14.644
And stay away from Senan.

50:17.981 --> 50:20.899
Senan... is my family...

50:20.901 --> 50:23.651
Why? Because
you killed together?

50:23.653 --> 50:26.195
'Cause you're a pack?

50:26.197 --> 50:27.991
That's not a family,
it's a sickness.

50:30.035 --> 50:31.953
He wouldn't have
told you that.

50:33.371 --> 50:34.872
Stay away from us.

51:15.455 --> 51:17.455
Elimination of
level one complete.

51:17.457 --> 51:19.459
Moving all remaining Resistant
to the holding area.

51:47.403 --> 51:48.279
Jo?

52:05.713 --> 52:06.631
My love?

52:10.551 --> 52:11.677
It's me.

52:29.070 --> 52:30.071
No!

52:35.243 --> 52:36.244
What are you doing?

52:38.871 --> 52:40.955
She's being brought to the
rest for euthanization.

52:40.957 --> 52:42.292
I can save her!

52:43.626 --> 52:45.253
Please, no!

52:50.258 --> 52:52.050
- Done.
- What am I?

52:52.052 --> 52:53.303
A dog.

52:53.970 --> 52:55.805
You're gonna love this.

52:57.223 --> 52:58.973
I look a bit more
like a gerbil.

52:58.975 --> 53:01.809
- No, you look like a dog.
- I look like a hamster.

53:01.811 --> 53:02.977
- And it's all your fault.
- You look like a dog.

53:02.979 --> 53:04.395
It's all your fault.

53:04.397 --> 53:06.105
...windows like
petulant teenagers.

53:06.107 --> 53:08.232
We need something that
will make them listen.

53:08.234 --> 53:10.151
We need to make ourselves
heard properly.

53:10.153 --> 53:11.986
- Yes!
- This is our country too.

53:11.988 --> 53:15.283
Yes!

54:35.280 --> 54:37.280
- You okay?
- Yeah.

54:37.282 --> 54:38.491
Sorry, just on edge.

54:40.160 --> 54:42.451
You look ridiculous.

54:42.453 --> 54:44.830
Yeah.
I'll go wash it off.

54:55.800 --> 54:58.009
I'm so used to doing this
on my own.

54:58.011 --> 55:00.136
It's so weird
having someone here.

55:00.138 --> 55:01.014
Yeah.

55:05.894 --> 55:07.562
When Cillian was born,
Luke was petrified.

55:09.898 --> 55:12.606
Well, it wasn't
exactly planned, so..

55:12.608 --> 55:13.526
Hmm.

55:17.197 --> 55:20.698
He said it was like somebody put
his heart inside somebody else.

55:20.700 --> 55:21.699
Christ.

55:22.743 --> 55:24.662
He could be
so pretentious.

55:29.750 --> 55:31.252
He'd be happy
you're here.

55:44.640 --> 55:46.059
Cured scum!

55:49.687 --> 55:50.563
Luke..

55:58.905 --> 56:00.573
Was there any
distinctive features?

56:02.825 --> 56:05.745
No. Just the anti-Cured
symbol.

56:07.914 --> 56:09.956
Did they say anythin'?

56:09.958 --> 56:10.833
No.

56:12.502 --> 56:14.335
We'll do everything
we can to catch them

56:14.337 --> 56:17.088
but, uh,
this sort of thing

56:17.090 --> 56:19.759
it's not uncommon
in homes with..

56:21.594 --> 56:22.637
Eh..

56:24.347 --> 56:27.517
- You can say Cured.
- E... exactly. Yes.

56:45.410 --> 56:46.494
You were right.

56:48.329 --> 56:49.495
I can't keep them safe.

56:51.082 --> 56:52.375
I need your help.

56:55.086 --> 56:56.754
They'll never
leave us alone.

57:00.258 --> 57:02.093
We need something that
will make them listen.

57:22.655 --> 57:23.988
Sergeant Cantor.

57:23.990 --> 57:25.491
It's about Conor.

57:26.993 --> 57:28.661
I think he's planning
something.

57:35.668 --> 57:36.752
Dr. Lyons?

57:40.256 --> 57:41.505
What's goin' on?

57:41.507 --> 57:43.632
I asked her to come.

57:43.634 --> 57:44.802
Sit down.

57:53.853 --> 57:54.938
They took Jo.

57:56.272 --> 57:57.855
We're gonna save her,
Senan.

57:57.857 --> 57:59.523
If we have
one of the Resistant

57:59.525 --> 58:01.692
they'll have to
take us seriously.

58:01.694 --> 58:03.363
No more bombings,
no more violence.

58:08.994 --> 58:10.912
What about the military?

58:11.704 --> 58:12.914
Mm?

58:14.540 --> 58:15.748
People could get killed.

58:15.750 --> 58:18.042
It's mainly
defense volunteers left.

58:18.044 --> 58:19.585
Scouts have
better trainin'.

58:19.587 --> 58:21.047
You don't know what the
fuck you're talkin' about.

58:26.552 --> 58:29.929
Joan, you can't agree
with this.

58:29.931 --> 58:32.058
I have to save her,
Senan.

58:33.684 --> 58:35.935
They're the same as us.

58:35.937 --> 58:38.064
We can't stand by
and do nothing.

58:56.791 --> 58:57.999
Get off, get off!

58:58.001 --> 58:59.752
Run! Run, run, run, run!

59:02.338 --> 59:03.671
Move, move, move!

59:03.673 --> 59:05.173
Senan, come on!

59:05.175 --> 59:07.633
Where are they?
Down. Get down.

59:07.635 --> 59:08.842
- Get down. I said stay down.
- And the rest of them.

59:08.844 --> 59:11.637
Get up against the wall!

59:11.639 --> 59:12.763
Go look in the basement,
there are more in there.

59:12.765 --> 59:14.640
Where are they off to?
Where are they going?

59:14.642 --> 59:15.518
Where?

59:47.717 --> 59:49.385
I told you
to stay away from us.

59:50.887 --> 59:53.346
Senan told me
about the break-in.

59:53.348 --> 59:55.016
I wanted to make sure
you were okay.

59:56.267 --> 59:57.602
I know it was you.

01:00:03.066 --> 01:00:04.607
You know,
for a while there

01:00:04.609 --> 01:00:08.736
I thought you and I,
that we had something.

01:00:08.738 --> 01:00:10.949
But it turns out you're
just like everybody else.

01:00:11.574 --> 01:00:12.617
Scared.

01:00:14.285 --> 01:00:16.204
And the truth is,
you're right to be scared.

01:00:18.831 --> 01:00:22.333
No matter how much
we pretend..

01:00:22.335 --> 01:00:24.004
...we're not
the same people anymore.

01:00:31.427 --> 01:00:34.139
All because daddy
wouldn't get you a job.

01:00:39.352 --> 01:00:41.479
You know,
I met your husband once.

01:00:45.108 --> 01:00:46.526
Bless him,
he tried his best.

01:00:47.860 --> 01:00:49.195
You're lying.

01:00:51.197 --> 01:00:53.656
You should ask
Senan about him.

01:00:53.658 --> 01:00:55.160
It's all very
Cain and Abel.

01:01:18.391 --> 01:01:19.267
No!

01:01:21.727 --> 01:01:23.271
Senan?

01:01:29.610 --> 01:01:31.277
Where's Conor?

01:01:32.863 --> 01:01:34.115
What's he planning?

01:01:35.783 --> 01:01:37.909
Senan?

01:01:37.911 --> 01:01:40.580
He doesn't care
about you.

01:01:44.542 --> 01:01:47.795
- He looked after me.
- He infected you!

01:01:50.506 --> 01:01:53.009
You have to give me
something.

01:01:54.302 --> 01:01:55.969
Before it's too late.

01:01:55.971 --> 01:01:58.012
Before the withdrawal
is over.

01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:00.514
Time's up.

01:02:05.021 --> 01:02:06.522
I can help.

01:02:07.941 --> 01:02:10.026
I can help your family.

01:02:13.529 --> 01:02:16.116
Isn't that what
Luke would want?

01:02:27.043 --> 01:02:28.336
Conor needs to see ya.

01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:30.881
Hey.

01:02:33.258 --> 01:02:34.382
12 o'clock.

01:02:34.384 --> 01:02:35.510
The baths.

01:02:53.444 --> 01:02:54.529
Hey.

01:02:58.449 --> 01:02:59.534
I'm sorry
I didn't come home.

01:03:04.039 --> 01:03:05.123
What's wrong?

01:03:19.429 --> 01:03:20.680
What happened to Luke?

01:03:30.023 --> 01:03:31.357
How did he die?

01:03:37.030 --> 01:03:38.698
- Abbie..
- Tell me.

01:03:48.374 --> 01:03:50.210
I thought it would be better
if you didn't know the truth.

01:04:09.854 --> 01:04:10.939
What happened?

01:04:14.109 --> 01:04:15.610
- What good will it do?
- Tell me!

01:04:22.783 --> 01:04:23.618
We were here.

01:04:28.831 --> 01:04:29.749
We..

01:04:33.461 --> 01:04:35.879
Luke thought that..

01:04:35.881 --> 01:04:38.131
...maybe you'd been
trapped here.

01:04:38.133 --> 01:04:40.218
But you'd already gone
by the time we got here.

01:04:44.472 --> 01:04:45.932
Then there was
an Infected.

01:04:48.143 --> 01:04:49.477
And he attacked me.

01:04:52.188 --> 01:04:53.023
Conor.

01:04:56.484 --> 01:04:57.610
Yeah.

01:05:02.198 --> 01:05:03.866
Luke tried
to fight him off.

01:05:06.827 --> 01:05:08.121
But it was too late.

01:05:15.003 --> 01:05:17.380
And then he barricaded
himself in the bedroom.

01:05:24.888 --> 01:05:27.055
I wasn't in control.

01:05:27.057 --> 01:05:30.183
Believe me,
I... I didn't know

01:05:30.185 --> 01:05:31.850
what I was doing, and...

01:05:31.852 --> 01:05:33.729
How could you not tell me?

01:05:35.690 --> 01:05:38.274
How could you sleep here?

01:05:38.276 --> 01:05:40.776
- I'm so sorry...
- Get out!

01:05:40.778 --> 01:05:42.530
Get the fuck out!

01:05:43.573 --> 01:05:44.613
Get the fuck out!

01:06:41.131 --> 01:06:42.382
I had to show you.

01:06:45.051 --> 01:06:46.887
They're all the same
when they know the truth.

01:06:49.890 --> 01:06:51.557
I'm your real family,
Senan.

01:06:57.230 --> 01:06:59.730
You never had
any nightmares, did you?

01:06:59.732 --> 01:07:00.816
Why should I?

01:07:01.902 --> 01:07:03.317
This is Sergeant Cantor.

01:07:03.319 --> 01:07:05.153
I need back-up
at the baths.

01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:09.365
On your knees,
hands on your head.

01:07:09.367 --> 01:07:11.784
Understood.
We're on our way.

01:07:11.786 --> 01:07:13.454
We will be
with you shortly.

01:07:17.959 --> 01:07:19.085
Get down.

01:07:20.378 --> 01:07:21.462
Now.

01:07:35.643 --> 01:07:37.643
I'm arresting you
for the murder

01:07:37.645 --> 01:07:39.314
of Cadet Jack Dermody.

01:07:41.649 --> 01:07:42.984
I did tell you, Conor.

01:07:44.903 --> 01:07:46.947
It's not your world
any more.

01:07:51.159 --> 01:07:52.285
Cuff yourself.

01:08:01.669 --> 01:08:02.877
Conor!

01:08:04.547 --> 01:08:06.630
Conor! Stop! Stop!

01:08:25.401 --> 01:08:26.569
Why?

01:08:28.404 --> 01:08:29.737
Why?

01:08:35.327 --> 01:08:36.995
I can't let you
go through with it.

01:08:38.956 --> 01:08:40.247
People will get hurt.

01:08:41.457 --> 01:08:43.042
I told you..

01:08:43.044 --> 01:08:45.296
...there's always
casualties.

01:08:47.798 --> 01:08:49.130
What're you planning?

01:08:49.131 --> 01:08:50.799
Conor.

01:08:50.801 --> 01:08:52.758
What're you
really planning?

01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:54.635
It's already done.

01:09:23.709 --> 01:09:25.627
The Cured on route.

01:09:26.712 --> 01:09:28.212
Understood.

01:09:28.214 --> 01:09:29.340
Copy that.

01:10:05.251 --> 01:10:06.920
Where's the control room?

01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:14.467
Come on.

01:11:01.473 --> 01:11:02.557
There she is.

01:11:12.027 --> 01:11:13.485
Come on, hurry up,
will you?

01:11:24.414 --> 01:11:25.747
What are you doing?

01:11:30.086 --> 01:11:31.501
This isn't the plan,
please.

01:11:31.503 --> 01:11:32.587
Yes, it is.

01:11:38.010 --> 01:11:40.680
- Look, this is madness.
- I told you to shut up.

01:11:55.611 --> 01:11:56.487
Oh, God!

01:12:34.734 --> 01:12:36.025
They're through,
they're through.

01:12:36.027 --> 01:12:37.403
They're pouring through!

01:13:57.317 --> 01:13:59.192
The fence is down!
The fence is down!

01:13:59.194 --> 01:14:00.650
The perimeter
has been breached!

01:14:00.652 --> 01:14:02.737
The fence is down. I need
some back-up over here!

01:14:38.608 --> 01:14:40.276
Welcome home, my love.

01:15:08.513 --> 01:15:10.265
No! No!

01:16:03.443 --> 01:16:04.945
Get in. Get in.

01:16:08.364 --> 01:16:10.114
- Okay, everyone..
- Get on the truck.

01:16:10.116 --> 01:16:11.406
Start making your way
onto the truck. Go.

01:16:11.408 --> 01:16:12.616
What's going on
with the schools?

01:16:12.618 --> 01:16:13.826
The schools
are being evacuated.

01:16:13.828 --> 01:16:15.244
No, no, I have to get
to my son. Please.

01:16:15.246 --> 01:16:16.745
All the kids
will be at the stadium.

01:16:16.747 --> 01:16:18.288
- I have to get to my son...
- Ma'am, you need..

01:16:23.463 --> 01:16:25.754
Get on the truck!
We've got to move!

01:16:25.756 --> 01:16:26.922
Get on the truck now!
Get on, quick!

01:16:26.924 --> 01:16:28.800
I've got to find my son!

01:16:30.511 --> 01:16:32.013
Get Cillian!

01:16:33.180 --> 01:16:34.139
Get Cillian!

01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:35.766
Get out!

01:17:27.609 --> 01:17:28.943
Hurry, hurry, hurry!
Let's go, let's go!

01:17:28.945 --> 01:17:29.777
Let's go, come on!

01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:35.615
Cillian!

01:17:37.578 --> 01:17:38.953
Cillian!

01:17:43.625 --> 01:17:44.626
Senan!

01:17:46.421 --> 01:17:48.087
- Senan!
- Hey, hey.

01:17:48.089 --> 01:17:49.132
Come here. Come here.

01:17:51.092 --> 01:17:53.176
Come on, I've got you.
I've got you.

01:17:53.178 --> 01:17:54.928
I've got you, come on.

01:17:54.930 --> 01:17:56.347
It's okay. It's okay.

01:17:59.350 --> 01:18:00.683
Please keep calm.

01:18:00.685 --> 01:18:02.767
If you are cured,
stay outside

01:18:02.769 --> 01:18:04.019
the perimeter fence.

01:18:04.021 --> 01:18:05.980
You are safe.
There is no room...

01:18:05.982 --> 01:18:07.606
Please let me in. How
do you know we're safe?

01:18:09.194 --> 01:18:10.318
Have the schools come yet?

01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:11.694
Walk through.

01:19:00.245 --> 01:19:01.952
He's just a boy.

01:19:03.539 --> 01:19:04.914
Run!

01:19:20.015 --> 01:19:21.139
Did you really think
you could betray me

01:19:21.141 --> 01:19:22.265
like that?

01:19:24.019 --> 01:19:25.350
Did you?

01:19:33.528 --> 01:19:34.859
Check your right.
Move, move, move.

01:19:34.861 --> 01:19:36.363
Let's go!
Get out! Come on!

01:19:38.490 --> 01:19:39.364
I was the only one
who really cared

01:19:39.366 --> 01:19:40.991
about you.

01:19:40.993 --> 01:19:43.953
I took care of you.

01:20:43.598 --> 01:20:44.640
Senan!

01:21:06.954 --> 01:21:08.871
Hey.

01:21:08.873 --> 01:21:09.957
You okay?

01:21:20.467 --> 01:21:21.551
Check the east side.

01:21:23.638 --> 01:21:25.891
Kill on sight.
Containment is priority.

01:21:28.059 --> 01:21:29.224
Guard down!

01:21:34.356 --> 01:21:35.275
Clear!

01:21:42.073 --> 01:21:44.698
Listen, there's
nothing wrong with her.

01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:47.035
- Look at her..
- He's my husband, he's..

01:21:47.037 --> 01:21:48.577
You can't treat
people like this.

01:21:48.579 --> 01:21:49.954
Why are they being
separated?

01:21:53.584 --> 01:21:55.625
Just let her through!

01:21:55.627 --> 01:21:57.295
I'm not infected.

01:21:57.297 --> 01:21:59.422
Why are they separated?
Why are they separated?

01:21:59.424 --> 01:22:00.466
Get out of my way!

01:22:02.552 --> 01:22:03.801
You have no right
to separate them

01:22:03.803 --> 01:22:04.885
they're not infected.

01:22:04.887 --> 01:22:06.138
Madam, calm down.

01:22:07.807 --> 01:22:09.432
Now everybody
needs to calm down!

01:22:12.812 --> 01:22:14.103
Come on, come on. Move.

01:22:14.105 --> 01:22:15.563
Move it! Move it!
Move it! Move it!

01:24:27.363 --> 01:24:28.737
Cillian?

01:24:32.910 --> 01:24:33.828
Cillian?

01:24:35.287 --> 01:24:36.121
Cillian.

01:25:03.315 --> 01:25:04.484
Mum!

01:25:06.486 --> 01:25:08.318
Oh, my.. Oh!

01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:09.403
I love you!

01:25:09.405 --> 01:25:10.281
Oh!

01:25:41.353 --> 01:25:43.023
You're gonna be okay.

01:25:46.151 --> 01:25:47.732
You're gonna be okay.

01:25:51.907 --> 01:25:53.072
I love you!

01:25:53.074 --> 01:25:54.200
Abbie.

01:26:01.582 --> 01:26:02.918
I love you.

01:26:03.584 --> 01:26:05.336
Stop! It's okay.

01:26:07.547 --> 01:26:08.922
There's a cure.

01:26:10.967 --> 01:26:12.550
He doesn't have to be
like me.

01:26:15.555 --> 01:26:16.932
Lyons found a cure.

01:26:19.559 --> 01:26:20.810
I can save him.

01:26:26.899 --> 01:26:27.982
Abbie.

01:26:35.325 --> 01:26:36.408
I love you.

01:26:38.328 --> 01:26:39.953
I love you.

01:26:39.955 --> 01:26:41.620
I love you, little..

01:26:41.622 --> 01:26:43.622
I love you. No..

01:26:45.251 --> 01:26:46.625
He's gonna be okay,
I promise.

01:26:46.627 --> 01:26:47.667
I promise.

01:27:27.252 --> 01:27:28.751
Following the recent
outbreak of the Maze

01:27:28.753 --> 01:27:30.710
virus in Ireland,
the country is beginning

01:27:30.712 --> 01:27:32.881
to regain control
once again.

01:27:32.883 --> 01:27:34.339
People are desperately
trying to track down

01:27:34.341 --> 01:27:36.466
loved ones, suspected
to be amongst the 8000

01:27:36.468 --> 01:27:37.968
newly Infected cases..

01:27:37.970 --> 01:27:40.429
Outcry against the humane
elimination is growing

01:27:40.431 --> 01:27:42.222
with families joining
the Cured Alliance who

01:27:42.224 --> 01:27:43.807
are leading the protests
against the government.

01:27:43.809 --> 01:27:45.059
The government
have agreed that

01:27:45.061 --> 01:27:46.476
continuing
the humane elimination

01:27:46.478 --> 01:27:48.312
is the only option
available

01:27:48.314 --> 01:27:49.479
if we are going to
stamp out this infection

01:27:49.481 --> 01:27:50.814
once and for all.

01:27:50.816 --> 01:27:52.316
..the government
are preparing to declare

01:27:52.318 --> 01:27:53.819
Ireland Infection free.

01:27:57.782 --> 01:27:59.323
We've obtained evidence
that a cure

01:27:59.325 --> 01:28:00.658
for the resistant strain
was perfected

01:28:00.660 --> 01:28:02.826
by Doctor Joan Lyons.

01:28:02.828 --> 01:28:04.453
Now, either
the government knew this

01:28:04.455 --> 01:28:06.414
and covered it up,
or they rushed

01:28:06.416 --> 01:28:07.665
into the
clean-up missions

01:28:07.667 --> 01:28:09.458
without considering
any options.

01:28:09.460 --> 01:28:11.169
The people of Ireland
deserve better

01:28:11.171 --> 01:28:12.420
they deserve
true leadership

01:28:12.422 --> 01:28:14.254
that is there
for the many and not...

01:28:14.256 --> 01:28:15.339
Sorry, we have
to interrupt here.

01:28:15.341 --> 01:28:17.591
We're receiving
breaking news.

01:28:17.593 --> 01:28:19.509
Despite reports,
camera traps

01:28:19.511 --> 01:28:21.720
have discovered pockets
of Infected still

01:28:21.722 --> 01:28:23.138
remaining in the west
of the country.

01:28:23.140 --> 01:28:25.640
The footage shows
at least 20 infected

01:28:25.642 --> 01:28:26.809
but the exact figures
have yet

01:28:26.811 --> 01:28:28.227
to be determined.

01:28:28.229 --> 01:28:30.188
The government has just
released a statement

01:28:30.190 --> 01:28:32.481
assuring those in
the area that a military

01:28:32.483 --> 01:28:34.067
platoon will be
dispatched

01:28:34.069 --> 01:28:35.693
to evacuate them.

01:28:35.695 --> 01:28:36.902
Now this begs
the question

01:28:36.904 --> 01:28:39.238
if the military failed
to detect these Infected

01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:40.823
how many more of them..
