00:07.980 --> 00:09.914

00:09.949 --> 00:12.717

        to see some ID.

screaming from here,            

00:34.640 --> 00:36.241
let me ask you                  
something.

      This friend of mine

00:38.978 --> 00:40.361
      All right, it's me.       

00:41.630 --> 00:43.848
    Now, I don't care           
    if they call each other     

00:43.882 --> 00:46.251
     cute little names like     
     "Chipper and Skipper,"     

00:46.285 --> 00:48.086
    or if they pretend          
    to be each other,           

00:48.120 --> 00:50.654
make their teachers' lives      
a living hell.

      See, what worries me      

00:52.174 --> 00:55.410
is that they'll have ESP,       
        you know,               

00:55.444 --> 00:57.879
    and they'll communicate     
     silent, evil thoughts      

00:57.914 --> 01:00.749
        and I won't know        
 what they're saying about me.  

01:01.867 --> 01:03.535
    You think that's weird?

have to pick up the slack.

            Not me.

     some high school kid.

    a lot of pressure,

     and I needed something     
 to calm my nerves, all right?  

03:52.354 --> 03:54.104
And I don't want to hear        
any stupid remarks

      has calmed her down.

is my fault.

                  talking about?

04:15.594 --> 04:17.528
Well, obviously you             
started smoking again           

04:17.563 --> 04:18.728
because you got some sort

frustration going on.

    to hear about it.

I just spent the last hour      
     at a no-smoking clinic     

10:14.452 --> 10:16.921

  was a cigarette snuffed out

  in the yolk of a fried egg.   

10:24.729 --> 10:27.248

 from wanting a cigarette, eh?

 it's put me off eggs for good.

what are you doing?

                torment her

12:32.374 --> 12:34.575
         to come down to the bar
         and meet the guys, but 

12:34.610 --> 12:35.776
            she just won't come.

12:35.810 --> 12:39.580
        Just wants to stay at   
        home and watch <i>Jeopardy.</i>

12:39.615 --> 12:43.267
    Uh, I think that maybe she's
    a little-little bit ashamed 

12:43.301 --> 12:44.268
        about the way she looks,

12:44.302 --> 12:46.470
            and she's afraid she
            might embarrass me. 

12:46.504 --> 12:49.073
                So, uh, you got 
                any suggestions,

12:49.107 --> 12:50.074
            or what can I do?   

12:50.108 --> 12:51.742
Let me see here. Um...          

12:51.777 --> 12:54.545
Oh. Have you ever seen          
those beauty magazine makeovers?

12:54.579 --> 12:55.946
            Oh, yeah, yeah,     
            yeah. Sure, sure.   

12:55.981 --> 12:57.948
Well, then what are you         
bugging <i>me</i> for?                 

12:57.983 --> 12:58.949
Oh, wait a minute.              

12:58.984 --> 13:00.317
If you ever see me              
with a cigarette                

13:00.351 --> 13:02.286
hanging out of my mouth,        
would you do me a favor?        

13:02.320 --> 13:03.020
                    What's that?

13:03.055 --> 13:04.621
    Kill Sam.                   

13:11.579 --> 13:16.917
Did you, uh, dab lip gloss      
    on your eyelashes           

13:16.951 --> 13:19.003
        so they sparkle         
      like the North Star?      

13:19.037 --> 13:22.222
SALLY:                          
Yes, Cliff.                     

13:22.257 --> 13:23.607
I'm coming out now.             

13:23.641 --> 13:24.909
                    Okay.       

13:24.943 --> 13:27.778
Listen, don't stand             
too close, okay?                

13:27.812 --> 13:29.246
Try me from a distance first.   

13:29.280 --> 13:30.247
        Okay.                   

13:30.281 --> 13:31.782
All right,                      
I'm backing up.                 

13:31.816 --> 13:33.817
All clear!                      

13:41.943 --> 13:43.861
              Wow.              

13:43.895 --> 13:46.062
      Gee, thanks, Cliff.       

13:47.732 --> 13:49.499
    Oh, isn't it about time     
         for <i>Jeopardy?</i>          

13:50.435 --> 13:51.869
              Huh?              

13:51.903 --> 13:54.154

13:57.025 --> 13:58.292
             Uh...              

13:59.927 --> 14:01.545
All right. Uh...                

14:01.579 --> 14:04.097
      Why don't we go out?      

14:04.132 --> 14:05.165
         Really, Cliff?         

14:05.199 --> 14:05.683
             Sure.              

14:05.717 --> 14:06.767
             Great.             

14:06.801 --> 14:08.369
Okay. I'll-I'll just, um,       

14:08.403 --> 14:10.804
 go do a little more blending,  
    and then we'll go.          

14:12.924 --> 14:16.894
I'll just, uh, be out here      

14:16.928 --> 14:20.597
 on the front porch and catch   
 a little breath of fresh air.  

14:24.269 --> 14:26.303

      ladies room. Please.      

14:44.305 --> 14:46.673
No, I'm not following her       
      in there again, Sam.      

14:46.708 --> 14:48.926
I'm one puff away from paradise.

14:48.960 --> 14:50.060
        Come on. Please.        

14:50.094 --> 14:52.346
      There's only so much      
      polite conversation       

14:52.380 --> 14:54.481
          you can make          
     yelling over a stall.      

14:58.169 --> 15:00.938
Cliff, this isn't a dive.       

15:00.972 --> 15:03.874
            Well, no, by a dive,
            I meant that, uh... 

15:03.908 --> 15:05.542
                it was below    
                street level.   

15:05.577 --> 15:07.077
        Oh, right.              

15:07.111 --> 15:08.311
             ( <i>nervous chuckle</i> )

15:08.346 --> 15:10.981
          Yeah, let me introduce
          you to my cronies.    

15:11.015 --> 15:12.716
                 but I gotta    
                 warn you first,

15:12.750 --> 15:15.552
        they can be a little    
        bit crude, all right?   

15:15.587 --> 15:17.888
                Hey, guys.      

15:17.922 --> 15:19.723
             Va-va-va-voom, huh?

15:22.493 --> 15:24.194
    Hello.                      

15:24.228 --> 15:26.063
         I, uh, thought we'd met
         all of Cliff's cousins.

15:26.097 --> 15:27.464
Oh, I'm not                     
his cousin.                     

15:27.499 --> 15:28.865
              No, she's my date.

15:28.900 --> 15:29.850
Would you like a                
little seat here?               

15:29.885 --> 15:30.851
I'll get you                    

15:30.886 --> 15:32.619
            something to drink. 
Nice to meet you.               

15:32.654 --> 15:33.654
    Likewise.                   

15:33.688 --> 15:34.989
             WOODY:             
      Well, I'll tell you.      

15:35.023 --> 15:37.891
She's what guys back down       
 on the farm where I come from  

15:37.926 --> 15:39.960
      would call ethereal.      

15:39.995 --> 15:42.096
    Woody,                      

15:42.130 --> 15:44.164
where exactly                   
was this farm?                  

15:47.269 --> 15:50.104
              A couple of beers,
              there, Wood man.  

15:50.138 --> 15:52.473
You got something               
on her, don't you?              

15:54.075 --> 15:56.643
      You found something       
incriminating in her mail.      

15:56.678 --> 15:59.112
    For God's sake, Cliff,      
    just ask her for money.     

15:59.146 --> 16:01.582
    Don't be vicious.           

16:01.616 --> 16:04.050
    Look, look, look,           
 is it so hard for you people,  

16:04.085 --> 16:05.819
  and whatever you are, Carla,  

16:05.853 --> 16:08.488
                to believe that,
                uh, this, uh,   

16:08.523 --> 16:10.858
  beautiful woman would go out  
with me on her own accord?      

16:10.892 --> 16:11.959
No, of course not,              
Cliff.                          

16:11.993 --> 16:13.594
I can think                     
of any number of reasons        

16:13.628 --> 16:15.295
why a woman                     
might behave that way.          

16:15.329 --> 16:16.563
                    You can?    

16:16.597 --> 16:18.215
Well, of course,                
but remember...                 

16:18.249 --> 16:19.749
I'm a psychiatrist.             

16:21.670 --> 16:23.604
So, hey, w-where's Sammy?       

16:23.638 --> 16:26.257
I wanna show him                
one gorgeous Bostonian          

16:26.291 --> 16:28.459
that slipped                    
through his net.                

16:28.493 --> 16:30.577
                 He's over there
                 hauling her in.

16:32.096 --> 16:33.297
        Ho! Ahem!               

16:33.331 --> 16:34.748
             Sammy!             

16:34.783 --> 16:37.551
        Oh, Sammy.              
    Oh, young fellow.           

16:37.585 --> 16:39.420
                Oh-ho, boy.     

16:39.454 --> 16:41.422
Oh, Cliff,                      
do you know each other?         

16:41.456 --> 16:42.556
                 Oh, yeah. Yeah.

16:42.590 --> 16:44.041
            Can I have a word   
            with you, Sammy?    

16:44.075 --> 16:45.709
    Yeah, see, she's with me.   

16:45.743 --> 16:46.894
                Oh, oh, oh, oh. 

16:46.928 --> 16:48.562
    Excuse us, Sally.           

16:48.596 --> 16:51.565
            Hey, she is one     
            very pretty lady.   

16:51.599 --> 16:52.566
Yeah, thank you, Sam.           

16:52.600 --> 16:55.235

              your, uh, cousins?

16:55.269 --> 16:57.437
She's my date.                  

16:57.471 --> 16:58.438
            Really?             

17:00.257 --> 17:01.458
      Well, is she, um...?      

17:01.492 --> 17:02.392
              Well, we think so.

17:04.079 --> 17:05.045
                    Well,       

17:05.079 --> 17:06.546
        congratulations, man.   
Yeah, yeah.                     

17:06.580 --> 17:08.714
Great. Listen, Sam,             
about that over there...        

17:08.750 --> 17:10.150
            No, I'm sorry. I    
            want to apologize   

17:10.185 --> 17:11.285
                  if I was out  
                  of line there,

17:11.319 --> 17:12.286
                but, well,      
                the truth is,   

17:12.319 --> 17:13.819
             you're gonna have  
             to expect that kind

17:13.855 --> 17:15.155
              of thing happening
              from now on.      

17:16.557 --> 17:18.058
    What do you mean?           

17:18.093 --> 17:19.192
          Well, she's definitely

17:19.226 --> 17:20.727
        a major-league          
        looker, there, Cliff.

            I mean, guys are    
            gonna be hitting    
            on her all the time.

17:23.097 --> 17:25.531
Ah, you don't have              
to worry about that, Sammy.

a new Porsche Turbo

      I don't mind at all.      

18:18.352 --> 18:19.869
    ( <i>clears throat</i> )           

18:19.904 --> 18:22.806
    Beer here, Woody.           

18:28.579 --> 18:30.380
                      Excuse me,
                      excuse me.

18:30.414 --> 18:33.366
              What was that lady
              doing in there?   

18:33.401 --> 18:34.868
             Oh, oh, no, no, no.

18:34.903 --> 18:36.870
             You know... no, you
             don't understand.  

18:36.905 --> 18:38.705
                See, we...      
                W-Wait a minute.

18:38.739 --> 18:40.707
         We have... we have this
         little bet between us. 

18:40.741 --> 18:42.009
                Let me... let   
                me explain here.

18:42.043 --> 18:45.378
See, I get to go to bed with her
    if she smo... Ow!           

18:45.413 --> 18:47.915
                All right, fine.

18:53.454 --> 18:55.506
          ALEX TREBEK:          
        Jamie Kelt              
     is a correct response,     

18:55.540 --> 18:57.775
 but you forgot to phrase that  
in the form of a question.      

18:57.809 --> 18:59.910
    That's why they call it     
         <i>Jeopardy.</i>              
            <i>Beer, Sam, please.</i>  

18:59.944 --> 19:01.077
Are you okay, Cliff?            

19:01.112 --> 19:02.746
    However, you get to make    
      the next selection.       

19:02.781 --> 19:05.515
       <i>Jeopardy</i> used to be      
     our show, Normie.          

19:05.549 --> 19:07.017
                    It's just   
                    not the same

19:07.051 --> 19:08.752
                     watching it
                     by myself. 

19:08.787 --> 19:12.155
    I just don't know           
  if I can go on without her.   

19:12.190 --> 19:14.440
      She's only been gone      
        for ten minutes.        

19:16.394 --> 19:18.512
    Yeah, I had to make her     
    beautiful, Normie.          

19:18.546 --> 19:20.848
          I've created          
      a beautiful monster.      

19:20.882 --> 19:22.082
     What am I going to do?     

19:22.116 --> 19:23.866
What is Paraguay?               
             WOMAN:             
    What is Paraguay?           

19:23.901 --> 19:28.338
            TREBEK:             
            Right.              
Yeah! All right!                

19:28.372 --> 19:30.691
  Well, thanks a lot, Normie.   

19:30.725 --> 19:32.659
      What is Notre Dame?!      
             WOMAN:             
      What is Notre Dame?       

19:32.694 --> 19:35.962
            TREBEK:             
         That's right.          
        Ooh, yeah!              

19:35.997 --> 19:38.365
        Hey, hey, hey, Carla.   

19:38.399 --> 19:41.134
      Do you smell smoke?       
        Come here.              

19:41.820 --> 19:44.204
Of course I smell smoke,        
you dink.                       

19:44.239 --> 19:45.372
It's a bar.                     

19:45.407 --> 19:48.675
I can also smell beer,          
sweat and lousy tips.           

19:48.709 --> 19:49.876
        No, no, no, no.         

19:49.911 --> 19:51.378
  No, she's smoking in there.   

19:51.413 --> 19:53.047
             I knew she couldn't
             last this long.    

19:53.081 --> 19:54.381
                Oh...           

19:54.416 --> 19:55.782
        A-ha!                   

19:57.201 --> 20:00.904
    Oh, uh... hey, uh,          
    where's the pool table?     

20:00.938 --> 20:03.473
        Ah, wrong room.         

20:10.298 --> 20:11.414
          ( <i>laughing</i> )          

20:11.449 --> 20:13.416
I knew it! I knew it!           
I knew it!                      

20:13.451 --> 20:15.418
I'm not going to say I knew it, 
but I knew it.                  

20:15.453 --> 20:16.919
I knew it.                      

20:16.954 --> 20:19.422
 Now, this was your idea, too.  
 I did not come up with this.   

20:19.457 --> 20:20.707
This is your idea.              

20:20.741 --> 20:22.909
     What a great idea! Oh!     

20:22.944 --> 20:25.261
( <i>laughing</i> )                    

20:25.296 --> 20:27.097
     Well, what do you say?     

20:27.131 --> 20:29.599
  Uh, shall we, uh, strip down  
    to our smiles here          

20:29.633 --> 20:33.436
      and show the, uh...       
show the couch here a good time?

20:33.470 --> 20:35.906
                        No.     

20:35.940 --> 20:37.590
     We'll go to my place.      

20:37.625 --> 20:39.926
    Excuse me?                  

20:39.961 --> 20:43.263
Ooh! You're really going to go  
through with this, aren't you?  

20:43.298 --> 20:45.749
        Yes, I am, but I want to
        get one thing straight. 

20:45.783 --> 20:46.483
        Ooh, yeah, yeah.        

20:46.517 --> 20:48.102
                  My smoking has
                  nothing to do 

20:48.136 --> 20:50.604
        with sexual frustration 
        over you or anyone else.

20:50.638 --> 20:52.606
                It's just a     
                stupid habit.   

20:52.640 --> 20:54.608
              But I made a pact,

20:54.642 --> 20:56.710
         so now I'm going to    
         suffer the consequences

20:56.745 --> 20:58.612
              no matter how vile

20:58.646 --> 21:01.381
                or disgusting   
                they may be.    

21:02.350 --> 21:03.817
                    Let's go.   

21:03.852 --> 21:05.452
            Well...             

21:06.854 --> 21:09.339
     You don't really want      
      to do this, do you?       

21:10.374 --> 21:11.741
      No, it's all right.       

21:11.775 --> 21:14.944
    I'll just close my eyes     
 and imagine someone appealing. 

21:16.364 --> 21:19.666
Besides, I have a feeling       
      it won't take long.       

21:22.787 --> 21:24.021
 You know, gee whiz, you know,  

21:24.055 --> 21:26.256
     if-if you're not going     
 to get in the spirit of this,  

21:26.290 --> 21:28.025
    then I-I just don't want    
        to do it.               

21:28.059 --> 21:30.626
     No, come on, come on,      
        a deal's a deal.        

21:30.661 --> 21:31.811
              No.               

21:31.846 --> 21:33.146
      Look, I made a pact.      
I just want to get it over with.

21:33.181 --> 21:34.647
No, I don't want to do it.      

21:35.983 --> 21:38.118
  You know, I have some pride.  
      I have some dignity.      

21:38.152 --> 21:38.902
             I'll tell you what.

21:38.936 --> 21:41.254
          You find someone else 
          to do your dirty work.

21:41.940 --> 21:44.158
      Thinks she can mess       
        with Sam Malone.        

21:44.192 --> 21:45.425
                  What happened?

21:45.460 --> 21:48.595
She asked me to go to bed       
with her, and I said no.        

21:48.630 --> 21:49.996
    Oh!                         

21:52.366 --> 21:54.951
Oh, Cliff,                      
I have never driven             

21:54.985 --> 21:57.120
so fast in my whole life.       

21:57.154 --> 21:59.122
I had the best time.            

21:59.156 --> 22:00.790
            Eh, great, great.   

22:00.825 --> 22:02.559
                    So did I.   

22:02.594 --> 22:04.494
Cliff, is something             
the matter?                     

22:04.529 --> 22:06.546
 No, uh, nothing's the matter.  

22:06.580 --> 22:07.747
What could be the matter?       

22:07.781 --> 22:10.566
I'll tell you what's the matter,
Little Miss Porsche.            

22:10.601 --> 22:11.902
Try to do a girl a favor,       

22:11.936 --> 22:13.904
        help her become         
 a little bit more attractive,  

22:13.938 --> 22:16.072
    and next thing you know,    
    she's out there...          

22:16.107 --> 22:17.607
    attracting people.          

22:18.642 --> 22:20.576
                  Is that what's
                  bothering you?

22:20.611 --> 22:22.078
                    This makeup?

22:22.113 --> 22:24.147
                Is that what all
                this is about?  

22:24.181 --> 22:27.083
 Well, yeah, you got to admit,  
     before you put it on,      

22:27.118 --> 22:29.920
         you were a...          

22:29.954 --> 22:32.255
                a sweet thing   
                who, uh...      

22:32.290 --> 22:34.090
              was content to sit

22:34.125 --> 22:36.360
              by a dear friend's
              side on an evening

22:36.394 --> 22:37.577
            and watch a rousing,

22:37.611 --> 22:39.913
                  wholesome game
                  of <i>Jeopardy.</i>  

22:39.947 --> 22:41.181
    So...                       

22:41.215 --> 22:44.417
    all I have to do to make    
 things right between us is...  

22:44.451 --> 22:46.586
 take off all this silly makeup 

22:46.620 --> 22:49.455
      and go back to being      
         the way I was?         

22:50.491 --> 22:53.026
            Wow, you... you'd   
            do that for me?     

22:53.060 --> 22:54.627
            No way.             

22:56.514 --> 22:59.066
I like the way I look in makeup.

22:59.100 --> 23:03.236
Wait till they get a load of me 
at the Yarn Barn.               

23:04.906 --> 23:06.807
            It makes you look   

23:06.841 --> 23:10.143
        like a... cover girl.   

23:10.178 --> 23:11.144
        ( <i>laughs</i> )              

23:11.179 --> 23:13.513
    I'm sorry, Cliff.           

23:14.164 --> 23:17.083
 That's what you're stuck with. 

23:17.785 --> 23:21.605
You're just going to have       
to learn to live with it.       

23:22.457 --> 23:25.408
      Well, I guess I'm...      

23:25.442 --> 23:28.078
     big enough of a person     
not to let your appearance      

23:28.112 --> 23:29.913
         get in the way         
      of our relationship.      

23:30.848 --> 23:32.565
    I'm glad.                   

23:32.600 --> 23:35.402
Besides, appearances            
don't matter at all.            

23:35.436 --> 23:37.737
        Of course they don't.   

23:37.772 --> 23:39.739
Like, it doesn't                
bother me                       

23:39.774 --> 23:42.742
that you wear                   
those funny white socks.        

23:42.777 --> 23:45.145
        Of course it doesn't.   

23:45.179 --> 23:46.914
Or that it looks                
as if you trim                  

23:46.948 --> 23:48.916
your mustache                   
with a butter knife.            

23:48.950 --> 23:50.583
                Eh, another     
                fine example.   

23:50.618 --> 23:53.420
Cliff, have you ever considered 
joining a gym?                  

23:53.454 --> 23:56.790
         Oh, you ever considered
         wearing flats?         

23:57.792 --> 23:58.758
                  I can help you

23:58.793 --> 24:00.961
              with that smoking 
              problem, you know.
