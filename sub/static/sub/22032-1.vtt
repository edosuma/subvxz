00:10.472 --> 00:14.766
__

00:14.966 --> 00:19.176
King George: <i>Babes in the
nest yearning to fly free.</i>

00:19.211 --> 00:22.083
<i>Hungry chicklings. Cheep, cheep, cheep.</i>

00:23.289 --> 00:24.725
<i>Tell me, Henry,</i>

00:24.759 --> 00:28.428
<i>have you ever observed
hatchlings in a scrape?</i>

00:28.463 --> 00:32.470
- No, Your Majesty.
- Ah, well, that's your problem, you see?

00:32.505 --> 00:34.140
You don't observe nature.

00:34.175 --> 00:36.778
But all of God's mysteries and secrets

00:36.812 --> 00:38.916
are revealed in the natural world

00:38.951 --> 00:42.859
if one has the wisdom to observe.

00:46.067 --> 00:49.272
In the tern's nest, one will see chicks.

00:49.307 --> 00:53.284
Tiny beaks open, crying for
mother bird to feed them.

00:53.318 --> 00:55.755
You see, it is the same for England

00:55.790 --> 00:58.759
and one's own colonies and dominions.

01:00.230 --> 01:02.933
You are from the Americas, Miss Wright?

01:02.967 --> 01:05.337
Aye, Your Majesty. New Jersey.

01:05.373 --> 01:08.781
But my sister lives in your Pennsylvania.

01:08.815 --> 01:11.085
- Does she now?
- <i> Aye.</i>

01:11.119 --> 01:14.389
And chirping more happily, I expect,

01:14.424 --> 01:16.726
now that your army has
driven the accursed rebels

01:16.760 --> 01:18.697
out of her home in Philadelphia.

01:19.834 --> 01:21.469
Quite.

01:24.241 --> 01:27.014
King George: <i>Pennsylvania is northern, yes?</i>

01:27.048 --> 01:29.153
North of tobacco, that is.

01:29.187 --> 01:31.457
- Hmm?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

01:31.492 --> 01:34.799
- Your Majesty, a word?
- Not now, Bill!

01:35.969 --> 01:38.406
Can't you see I'm <i> in situ?</i>

01:38.440 --> 01:41.647
You may wish to remain so, sir.

01:42.816 --> 01:45.186
Everyone out.

01:52.164 --> 01:53.864
Shouldn't be long.

01:53.899 --> 01:56.630
He grows tired of the
exchequer within an hour.

01:56.664 --> 01:58.497
Don't mind me.

01:58.531 --> 02:01.335
My mother named me Patience so
I would always have a little.

02:01.369 --> 02:04.004
We should have all been blessed so, eh?

02:04.038 --> 02:06.706
Robert Rogers,

02:06.740 --> 02:09.642
<i>Lieutenant Colonel Commandant</i>

02:09.675 --> 02:13.510
of His Majesty's Queen's Rangers in America

02:13.544 --> 02:15.575
and your loyal servant.

02:15.610 --> 02:17.475
Should we curtsy?

02:17.510 --> 02:19.344
Or have you a petition for the king?

02:19.379 --> 02:20.980
An appointment yesterday.

02:21.014 --> 02:22.779
And the day before that and
the day before that, too.

02:22.813 --> 02:24.879
Oh, yes, and I recall on one of those days

02:24.914 --> 02:27.349
I made quite clear that you were on the list

02:27.383 --> 02:31.019
- and you shall be seen when called.
- King George: <i> Out! Get out!</i>

02:31.053 --> 02:33.420
<i>I'll finish sitting for my portrait</i>

02:33.455 --> 02:36.255
<i>and hear no more of this.</i>

02:36.289 --> 02:39.892
<i>And get that bloody
charlatan back here at once.</i>

02:43.030 --> 02:44.962
Please.

02:49.236 --> 02:50.902
Miserable West Indies.

02:50.937 --> 02:53.135
I knew... I knew we never should have...

02:54.672 --> 02:57.509
How dare they tell me we owe?

02:57.543 --> 02:59.343
I am the one who collects.

02:59.377 --> 03:01.979
I collect!

03:06.915 --> 03:08.851
(Shouts)

03:08.885 --> 03:12.753
They treat me as though
I'm some sort of child.

03:12.787 --> 03:15.890
I don't care what it costs

03:15.924 --> 03:17.357
in Maratha.

03:17.392 --> 03:21.225
I don't care what it costs in the Caribbean.

03:21.260 --> 03:23.329
Responsibility, he says.

03:23.363 --> 03:25.363
Yes, responsibility.

03:25.397 --> 03:27.132
<i>No, no, no.</i>

03:27.166 --> 03:30.236
Majesty, please. We must keep...

03:32.471 --> 03:33.971
Clean that up.

03:34.006 --> 03:35.606
-<i> Your Majesty...</i>
- King George: <i>What are you doing?</i>

03:35.641 --> 03:37.774
<i>Why are you always following
me around? Everywhere you go.</i>

03:37.809 --> 03:40.673
<i>We're down on all fours, are we now?</i>

03:40.708 --> 03:42.976
Like a little dog, are we?
What, is it dog time?

03:43.011 --> 03:44.478
Dog time? Woof, woof, woof!

03:44.513 --> 03:47.378
<i>Woof, woof, woof! Woof, woof,
woof, woof, woof, woof, woof.</i>

03:47.413 --> 03:50.081
<i>Yes?</i>

03:50.115 --> 03:52.746
<i>You're a ridiculous little man.</i>

03:52.781 --> 03:54.413
- <i>(dog barking)</i>
- <i>(Bell ringing)</i>

03:54.447 --> 03:57.915
- <i>(horse neighs)</i>
- <i>(Laughter)</i>

04:03.046 --> 04:05.580
(laughter continues)

04:11.919 --> 04:13.952
(panting)

04:13.986 --> 04:16.055
- Oh!
- (Laughs)

04:16.089 --> 04:17.757
Oi, you kicked me eye.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.858
Don't need your eye.

04:19.894 --> 04:21.928
(laughs, squeals)

04:23.363 --> 04:25.731
(screams)

04:25.765 --> 04:26.899
No!

04:26.933 --> 04:29.903
Stop! Stop it!

04:29.938 --> 04:32.871
(Screams) Stop! Stop!

04:32.905 --> 04:34.406
(Screams)

04:36.277 --> 04:37.842
Stop!

04:37.877 --> 04:39.242
Enough!

04:41.678 --> 04:44.812
It's a bust of the king we're after.

04:44.846 --> 04:48.015
Where has it gone? Where have you sent it?

04:48.050 --> 04:51.885
To Versailles? To Benjamin
Franklin in Paris?

04:51.919 --> 04:55.052
How would you sail it past the embargo line?

04:55.086 --> 04:57.089
Your Grace, please, I... I don't...

04:57.124 --> 04:58.725
I don't...

05:00.961 --> 05:03.564
Shall we open his head and
look there for what you stole?

05:03.599 --> 05:05.066
No, please. This boy is innocent.

05:05.100 --> 05:07.999
If not France, then where?

05:10.800 --> 05:12.801
America.

05:14.804 --> 05:17.106
No, not America.

05:19.372 --> 05:22.507
It is bound for the United States.

05:24.409 --> 05:26.807
- (Gunshot)
- (Gasps)

05:29.644 --> 05:32.242
What's the name of the ship?

05:33.944 --> 05:35.677
That won't help you now.

05:35.712 --> 05:39.646
Then let us continue this discourse

05:39.680 --> 05:42.846
in my workshop.

05:42.881 --> 05:44.782
Man: <i>Sir.</i>

ago. It's bound for Brooklyn.</i>

__

06:51.007 --> 06:53.409
Ben: <i>"The Thoughts of a Free Man."</i>

06:53.443 --> 06:56.309
<i>This is an anonymous
attack on your leadership</i>

06:56.344 --> 06:57.976
and it's been circulating in the camp.

06:58.010 --> 07:00.245
Look, it begins by laying the loss

07:00.279 --> 07:01.813
of Philadelphia at your feet

07:01.848 --> 07:03.681
and it concludes with
calling for your exile.

07:03.716 --> 07:07.320
It compares you to the demon Ba'al.

07:07.354 --> 07:09.153
There are rumors that Horatio Gates

07:09.187 --> 07:11.020
and Charles Lee have
both written to Congress

07:11.054 --> 07:13.423
to have you removed as
the commander-in-chief.

07:13.457 --> 07:15.091
I requested an intelligence report

07:15.125 --> 07:17.694
on the movements of the enemy

07:17.728 --> 07:20.265
and you come to me with rumor.

07:20.300 --> 07:24.335
Sir, I see myself as your eyes and your ears

07:24.370 --> 07:26.570
against all threats to your leadership.

07:26.604 --> 07:30.774
Then what do you see
and hear in Philadelphia?

07:30.808 --> 07:32.775
Well, the...

07:32.810 --> 07:34.644
sir, the city having just been taken,

07:34.678 --> 07:37.245
I've not had time to
cultivate a source there yet.

07:39.481 --> 07:42.015
New York, then.

07:42.049 --> 07:45.684
You have had sufficient time to get a person

07:45.718 --> 07:49.253
of intelligence inside that city.

07:49.287 --> 07:51.354
The advice from whom would provide critical

07:51.389 --> 07:53.756
should we move to retake it.

07:55.458 --> 07:57.994
What is the status of their defense?

07:58.028 --> 08:01.264
I depend on you

08:01.298 --> 08:04.033
to enlighten us.

08:04.067 --> 08:06.602
Your man Culpeper on Long Island,

08:06.636 --> 08:08.299
what word from him?

08:09.903 --> 08:12.639
Well, it's... it's Culper, sir.

08:12.673 --> 08:15.338
And it's still too
dangerous to make contact.

08:17.338 --> 08:20.505
I require a full report on New York
Harbor before we move camp.

08:20.539 --> 08:24.375
<i>You shall engage Culper</i>

08:24.409 --> 08:27.976
or recommend to me a new head

08:28.011 --> 08:29.810
of intelligence.

08:29.844 --> 08:31.713
Yes. Yes, sir.

08:33.216 --> 08:35.451
My courier is in the camp as we speak

08:35.486 --> 08:38.354
and he'll be ready to set sail tonight.

08:39.589 --> 08:41.188
- (Drumming)
- Right here, you.

08:41.222 --> 08:43.390
Come on! Right here, you.

08:43.424 --> 08:45.293
Right in my lily-white nut sack.

08:45.327 --> 08:47.094
Huh? Come on, you savage.

08:47.128 --> 08:49.062
Make your people proud. Right here!

08:49.097 --> 08:51.565
Come on!

08:51.600 --> 08:54.735
Whoo! That's what I'm talking about!

08:56.271 --> 08:57.905
Drinks on me, fellas.

08:57.940 --> 08:59.774
What did I tell you? Huh?

08:59.808 --> 09:01.743
What did I tell you? Right here.

09:01.777 --> 09:04.379
(Speaking Oneida) Right?

09:04.413 --> 09:07.414
I assume you put in the proper
request for all these supplies?

09:07.448 --> 09:09.248
Huh? Request? No.

09:09.283 --> 09:11.085
No, these are my gifts for the cause.

09:11.119 --> 09:13.689
Oh, I see. The black market, then.

09:13.723 --> 09:16.092
Yeah, you do see.

09:18.563 --> 09:21.532
Well, perhaps you might be getting the itch

09:21.567 --> 09:22.867
to make another trade tonight.

09:22.902 --> 09:25.502
Maybe visit our old hometown,

09:25.537 --> 09:27.338
visit an old friend.

09:28.306 --> 09:30.674
Nah, not tonight.

09:32.542 --> 09:35.077
I... I'm afraid this is
not a request, Caleb.

09:35.111 --> 09:37.179
It is an order.

09:37.213 --> 09:38.946
- An order?
- That's right.

09:38.981 --> 09:40.614
I think I'm done with those.

09:40.649 --> 09:42.418
- Done?
- Yeah.

09:42.452 --> 09:44.087
What, done with orders?

09:44.121 --> 09:47.790
Orders, Culper, army.

09:47.825 --> 09:50.827
I mean, it's all a bit
of a tail chaser, yeah?

09:50.862 --> 09:53.229
But with this here, whale oil,

09:53.263 --> 09:55.931
plucked from a fat Tory
skiff off of New Haven

09:55.965 --> 09:58.434
and resold for ã12 on Devil's Belt...

09:58.468 --> 10:02.069
that's the kind of profit that can make
a man think about quitting the army

10:02.103 --> 10:05.605
and applying to Congress
for a license to privateer.

10:09.943 --> 10:12.179
Loyal subjects harass at my pleasure

10:12.213 --> 10:14.978
and make a bit of coin on the side.

10:15.012 --> 10:18.144
And the best part... the best part

10:18.179 --> 10:20.980
is the only one I'm risking

10:21.014 --> 10:22.647
is me.

10:22.680 --> 10:25.014
Han Yerry! (laughs)

10:25.048 --> 10:27.913
Look, Caleb, this is not my order.

10:27.947 --> 10:31.183
- It's Washington's.
- Oh, Washington.

10:31.218 --> 10:34.552
Well, you'll just have to tell him
that you're following protocol.

10:34.587 --> 10:36.418
See, Culper doesn't signal unless it's safe,

10:36.453 --> 10:38.154
and he ain't signaled in two months.

10:38.188 --> 10:40.222
- So it ain't safe.
- Caleb, listen to me.

10:41.855 --> 10:43.622
I am listening, Ben.

10:43.657 --> 10:45.325
I'm listening now like I
should have listened before.

10:45.359 --> 10:47.358
Like when you ordered to let Simcoe live,

10:47.393 --> 10:49.895
I should have listened to reason
and put my hatchet in his head.

10:49.929 --> 10:52.696
But I didn't.

10:52.731 --> 10:55.599
And he survived long
enough to kill my uncle.

10:57.035 --> 10:59.236
Now that's on me.

10:59.270 --> 11:01.970
You want to get Abe killed?

11:02.004 --> 11:03.905
That's on you.

11:04.840 --> 11:06.408
Caleb.

11:10.613 --> 11:12.949
<i>(Music playing)</i>

11:16.754 --> 11:18.354
Two more here

11:18.389 --> 11:20.355
and we shall collect
whatever drinking glasses

11:20.390 --> 11:22.558
guests used during hors d'oeuvres
before we seat for dinner.

11:22.592 --> 11:24.326
Yes, ma'am.

11:25.795 --> 11:27.760
<i>(Soft chatter)</i>

11:27.794 --> 11:30.128
- Circle, circle.
- (Chuckles)

11:30.162 --> 11:31.529
Everything comes round.

11:31.564 --> 11:33.633
Thomas, do be careful with Grandfather.

11:33.666 --> 11:36.164
- Don't lean on him so.
- He's fine. So am I.

11:36.199 --> 11:39.432
You're still recovering.

11:39.467 --> 11:42.799
Mary, there is perfection
and then there is obsession.

11:42.833 --> 11:46.534
Whitehall has been without a
wife's care for far too long.

11:46.569 --> 11:49.471
And that was before it became home
to soldiers and bachelors alike.

11:49.505 --> 11:52.003
Well, I think you've done a miracle.

11:52.038 --> 11:54.874
I agree. In fact, I was
trying to relate to Sarah

11:54.908 --> 11:56.874
the extraordinary circumstance
of your journey here,

11:56.909 --> 11:58.977
<i>but I just couldn't do it justice.</i>

12:00.546 --> 12:03.514
Will you please tell Sarah
the story of the rebel raid?

12:03.548 --> 12:06.283
<i>The night they burned your husband's farm.</i>

12:06.317 --> 12:08.921
If only as an example
of how to survive such.

12:08.956 --> 12:11.989
We've had no raids in Oyster Bay,

12:12.023 --> 12:14.324
not since the regulars took the island.

12:14.359 --> 12:16.495
And we're as safe here on Long Island

12:16.529 --> 12:19.200
as any can hope to be in the colonies.

12:21.034 --> 12:25.069
But these rebels, they have no fear.

12:25.104 --> 12:27.874
Or they have so much, they're numb to it.

12:29.310 --> 12:32.377
<i>They feel as if they have</i>

12:32.412 --> 12:35.547
<i>nothing left to lose and
they hate us who do.</i>

12:37.717 --> 12:41.921
So after Ben Tallmadge made
his retreat from our town,

12:41.955 --> 12:43.920
some of his men stayed behind

12:43.954 --> 12:46.089
to plunder what they could on the way out.

12:48.225 --> 12:50.022
Abraham and I thought they'd gone.

12:50.057 --> 12:53.259
<i>And so we returned home that night.</i>

12:53.293 --> 12:57.926
<i>Abe had just taken Thomas out to the privy.</i>

12:57.961 --> 13:00.327
<i>We were spent and just wanted to sleep</i>

13:00.362 --> 13:02.360
<i>when five men showed up</i>

13:02.394 --> 13:04.692
<i>vowing revenge on the son of the magistrate.</i>

13:04.727 --> 13:08.430
Brave Ensign Baker stood against all five.

13:10.063 --> 13:11.295
And they shot him dead.

13:11.330 --> 13:14.029
- (Gunshot)
- <i> (Mary screams)</i>

13:14.064 --> 13:15.296
Mr. Baker!

13:20.397 --> 13:22.529
Mary: <i>They couldn't find Abraham</i>

13:22.564 --> 13:25.932
<i>as he was protecting Thomas.</i>

13:25.967 --> 13:29.735
<i>So they set fire to the house and fled.</i>

13:50.483 --> 13:54.082
How awful. Everything gone.

13:54.984 --> 13:56.950
No, not everything.

14:01.551 --> 14:04.686
<i>We had each other.</i>

14:04.721 --> 14:07.721
<i>And together, Abraham and I
have vowed to move forward</i>

14:07.756 --> 14:10.123
<i>and leave the past where it lay.</i>

15:26.026 --> 15:29.896
- <i> (music playing)</i>
- <i> (Chatter, laughter)</i>

15:30.615 --> 15:32.782
Mr. DeJong calling for you.

15:32.817 --> 15:34.617
Thank you, Cicero.

15:45.126 --> 15:47.963
(Coughing)

15:48.865 --> 15:51.866
(men singing drunkenly)

15:55.735 --> 15:58.336
(laughing)

15:58.371 --> 16:01.706
Ah, Anna. More jugs, please.

16:01.740 --> 16:03.872
<i>(Man urinating)</i>

16:03.907 --> 16:06.808
(laughs)

16:07.676 --> 16:09.845
And, deary,

16:09.879 --> 16:13.181
could you be dearier and empty this

16:13.215 --> 16:15.081
on your travels? (laughs)

16:15.116 --> 16:18.615
How about I save time and refill right here?

16:18.650 --> 16:21.582
Your ale's likely superior
to what we've got stocked.

16:23.116 --> 16:24.415
(Sloshes)

16:25.517 --> 16:29.022
Oh, Major. Welcome.

16:29.056 --> 16:31.222
(Music stops)

16:31.257 --> 16:32.623
Is there a problem?

16:32.657 --> 16:35.159
A problem?

16:35.194 --> 16:40.161
No, I simply wish to drink an ale.

16:40.196 --> 16:42.566
Anna, an ale for the major.

16:42.600 --> 16:44.566
Two. Op-op.

16:44.600 --> 16:47.466
I actually have a matter to
discuss with Mrs. Strong.

16:47.500 --> 16:50.634
If you could procure the drink,
Mr. DeJong, that would be helpful.

16:55.175 --> 16:57.740
(Sloshes)

16:57.774 --> 16:59.843
<i>(music resumes)</i>

16:59.877 --> 17:03.078
Um, Mary Woodhull is hosting a dinner,

17:03.112 --> 17:06.214
you see, at Whitehall.

17:06.248 --> 17:09.750
And, well, you see, she's been
trying to do so for the past month.

17:09.785 --> 17:11.987
Host a dinner in my honor, that is.

17:12.021 --> 17:15.520
As fortune would have it for Mrs.
Woodhull and indeed the rest of us,

17:15.554 --> 17:17.622
the capture of Philadelphia

17:17.656 --> 17:19.790
is a victory worth celebrating,

17:19.825 --> 17:21.992
<i>and celebrate we shall tonight.</i>

17:22.026 --> 17:24.292
And I would be honored

17:24.328 --> 17:27.627
to escort you there as my guest.

17:28.864 --> 17:31.365
- Me?
- You.

17:31.399 --> 17:34.700
- With you?
- With me.

17:35.869 --> 17:37.938
Uh, not...

17:45.444 --> 17:47.978
Allow me to... this is not a...

17:48.012 --> 17:51.311
gesture or an advance in any way.

17:51.345 --> 17:53.348
I sincerely wish to honor

17:53.382 --> 17:55.450
the loyalty and the bravery that you showed

17:55.484 --> 17:59.319
on the day that you leapt
from your rebel captors.

18:02.790 --> 18:05.556
I betrayed my husband, sir.

18:05.590 --> 18:07.590
<i>It was his boat I jumped from.</i>

18:07.624 --> 18:10.660
You chose loyalty to your king.

18:10.694 --> 18:13.661
There can be no nobler sacrifice.

18:13.696 --> 18:15.865
I doubt the Woodhulls will see it that way.

18:15.899 --> 18:19.236
It was Abraham who reminded
me of your right action

18:19.270 --> 18:22.804
and who inspired me to take my own.

18:22.838 --> 18:26.336
Abraham Woodhull

18:26.371 --> 18:29.472
suggested you invite me to his home?

18:29.507 --> 18:31.443
No, that was my idea.

18:31.477 --> 18:34.510
But he did acknowledge the difficulties
that your families have had

18:34.544 --> 18:36.677
and felt that it's time for all differences

18:36.711 --> 18:40.081
to be put aside and for common
bonds to be strengthened.

18:41.615 --> 18:44.245
His words, not mine.

18:52.886 --> 18:55.521
(Music playing)

18:58.057 --> 19:00.391
- Good evening.
- A pleasure.

19:00.425 --> 19:02.392
Mr. DeJong.

19:02.427 --> 19:05.229
Father, please sit down. Mary
and I can greet the guests.

19:05.264 --> 19:07.466
I'm fine. Will you please
stop fussing, Abraham?

19:07.500 --> 19:09.903
- All right, all right.
- <i> (Door opens)</i>

19:12.142 --> 19:13.843
Anna.

19:13.877 --> 19:15.578
Ah, there you are.

19:15.613 --> 19:18.651
You all know Mrs. Strong, of course.

19:18.685 --> 19:20.952
You look fine, madam. Very fine.

19:20.986 --> 19:22.687
Anna: <i>Thank you.</i>

19:22.721 --> 19:24.925
Ah, yes.

19:27.094 --> 19:30.968
And thank you all for having me.

19:31.002 --> 19:33.639
- I think I may have that sit now after all.
- Absolutely.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.474
I'll... I'll help you, Father.

19:36.911 --> 19:40.177
Major, perhaps a viewing of the Loch Lomond.

19:40.211 --> 19:42.748
Hmm. Mrs. Strong, would you care

19:42.783 --> 19:45.152
to view Loch Lomond before
dinner gets underway?

19:45.186 --> 19:47.418
There's nothing like it in
Setauket. You really should.

19:47.452 --> 19:50.420
By all means, then.

19:50.454 --> 19:52.422
This way.

20:01.694 --> 20:03.393
Father.

20:03.427 --> 20:05.996
The major wants to chime in on
the wine choice for tonight.

20:06.031 --> 20:08.196
We have Madeira, claret, and Virginia white.

20:08.230 --> 20:10.264
He can arrange them in
whatever sequence he wishes.

20:10.298 --> 20:12.432
All right, don't kill the messenger.

20:12.466 --> 20:14.201
No, actually, pork.

20:14.235 --> 20:17.005
- Who is the artist?
- Jacob More.

20:17.039 --> 20:18.808
Specializing in portraiture,

20:18.842 --> 20:22.079
but a trip to Florence has
broadened his intentions, it seems,

20:22.113 --> 20:26.184
and perhaps made him long for home.

20:26.218 --> 20:28.250
(Knocks)

20:28.285 --> 20:30.253
Major, our esteemed magistrate

20:30.287 --> 20:32.188
wishes you to consult on a wine strategy.

20:32.223 --> 20:34.691
(Chuckles) Ah, indeed.

20:34.725 --> 20:36.527
To battle, then.

20:40.263 --> 20:41.897
Ah, ah.

20:48.470 --> 20:50.038
- Signal Caleb.
- What?

20:50.072 --> 20:52.140
- Where have you been?
- She's been watching.

20:52.174 --> 20:54.273
- If not her, then her sewing circle.
- It's been over a month.

20:54.307 --> 20:56.542
I've hado play my part, but I'm ready now.

20:56.576 --> 20:58.444
For what?

20:58.478 --> 21:00.313
This is for Ben.

21:00.347 --> 21:02.345
It's instructions for a new code book.

21:02.380 --> 21:04.348
It explains about Ensign Baker.

21:04.383 --> 21:06.385
How he found the book, how I shot him,

21:06.419 --> 21:08.685
how I fired my farm and said
Tallmadge's men were to blame.

21:08.719 --> 21:10.184
You want to tell Ben the truth?

21:10.219 --> 21:12.522
- What about Mary?
- Everything except Mary.

21:12.556 --> 21:14.357
Excuse me.

21:16.726 --> 21:19.695
Abe: <i> If Washington finds out that she
knows, he may think me compromised.</i>

21:19.729 --> 21:21.499
You are compromised. She does know.

21:21.533 --> 21:22.966
Just take it to the drop.

21:23.001 --> 21:25.536
Signal Caleb. I have the rest in hand.

21:25.570 --> 21:27.306
Wait.

21:30.578 --> 21:32.313
It's a stiletto blade.

21:37.820 --> 21:40.657
I have to get used to
wearing it under the suit.

21:40.691 --> 21:43.428
It's the one I'll be taking to New York.

21:43.463 --> 21:45.966
New York? How?

21:46.000 --> 21:48.102
You've no cabbage to
sell and no hogs to trade

21:48.136 --> 21:50.038
as you've burned your bridges
with the quartermaster.

21:50.073 --> 21:51.841
What excuse could you possibly...

21:54.212 --> 21:56.280
You'll see tonight.

21:58.479 --> 22:00.813
<i>(Door opens, closes)</i>

22:12.025 --> 22:13.957
<i>(door opens)</i>

22:22.228 --> 22:25.499
- (chatter)
- (Clinking glass)

22:25.533 --> 22:27.434
- <i> (chatter stops)</i>
- Ah.

22:29.435 --> 22:32.939
Tonight we celebrate the
victories in our king's name

22:32.973 --> 22:36.777
and we honor the sacrifice
made along the way.

22:36.811 --> 22:40.313
This year I learned the power of loss.

22:40.348 --> 22:42.785
And I'm not speaking of my farm,

22:42.819 --> 22:46.420
but of when I nearly lost
my father to a rebel bullet

22:46.454 --> 22:48.423
and our town nearly lost its magistrate.

22:48.457 --> 22:51.993
A possibility which
should terrify all of you

22:52.028 --> 22:54.661
considering it was I who had
to prosecute in his stead.

22:54.696 --> 22:56.832
- You performed admirably.
- Father, I lost the case.

22:56.866 --> 22:59.503
That happens. Not to me so much, but...

22:59.537 --> 23:01.471
(all laughing)

23:01.506 --> 23:04.208
No.

23:04.242 --> 23:06.311
Loss begets gain.

23:06.345 --> 23:08.044
It inspires change.

23:08.079 --> 23:10.944
<i>Your near loss pushed me
to take up the law again</i>

23:10.978 --> 23:14.314
and my loss at trial
pushed me to want to win.

23:14.349 --> 23:16.581
Especially against those who rape

23:16.615 --> 23:19.151
and murder in the name of independence.

23:19.185 --> 23:23.318
My toast to you tonight is a promise.

23:25.355 --> 23:28.592
I am to finish what I
began at King's College.

23:28.627 --> 23:31.922
<i>I aim to study the law by your example.</i>

23:31.956 --> 23:35.359
And come one day,

23:35.394 --> 23:37.929
I will set out for New York

23:37.964 --> 23:39.664
to seek an apprenticeship to a barrister.

23:39.699 --> 23:42.900
And even if it takes me a
year of going there and back,

23:42.935 --> 23:45.737
I will see it through.

23:45.772 --> 23:47.773
I've found my calling.

23:49.142 --> 23:51.313
And you have made your father very proud.

23:51.347 --> 23:53.515
Hewlett: <i>Hear, hear. Hear, hear.</i>

23:53.549 --> 23:55.582
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

23:55.616 --> 23:57.451
<i>Shall we eat? Let's eat.</i>

23:57.485 --> 24:00.556
(voices echo)

24:07.930 --> 24:10.398
No, no. I... no. I'm sorry.

24:10.433 --> 24:12.634
I'm sorry, Abraham. I can't let you do that.

24:12.668 --> 24:14.770
I'm sorry.

24:19.342 --> 24:21.243
Mary, what are you...
what are you talking about?

24:21.277 --> 24:23.445
You know why you can't go to New York.

24:28.116 --> 24:31.816
The rebels burned your farm.
They shot your father.

24:31.850 --> 24:34.018
You are the son of the magistrate

24:34.052 --> 24:35.919
and they hate you for that.

24:35.954 --> 24:38.756
You were a target of the
Patriots and they will try again.

24:38.790 --> 24:43.160
(Stammering) You think that
I'm in danger of some kind?

24:43.195 --> 24:45.796
There have been tales of... of kidnapping

24:45.831 --> 24:47.932
<i>and killing of prominent Tories</i>

24:47.966 --> 24:50.501
all over Long Island.

24:50.536 --> 24:52.770
Ensign Baker died defending your farm.

24:52.805 --> 24:54.639
<i>You yourself were beaten and robbed</i>

24:54.673 --> 24:57.141
on the way to York City and
you wish to try again alone?

24:57.176 --> 24:58.877
Mary.

24:58.911 --> 25:00.912
I agree with you, madam.

25:00.946 --> 25:04.683
<i>And that is why I shall
guarantee his safety.</i>

25:04.717 --> 25:07.019
He shall be granted an escort.

25:07.053 --> 25:08.454
Richard: <i>Now that is wise.</i>

25:08.488 --> 25:10.955
I hire two every trip.

25:10.990 --> 25:15.029
No, Major, I couldn't possibly
afford to pay for such a...

25:15.063 --> 25:16.530
There is no need.

25:16.565 --> 25:18.430
I shall provide a top
man from my own regiment

25:18.464 --> 25:21.167
<i>who will go with you to the
city and stay by your side</i>

25:21.201 --> 25:22.870
<i>till your journey is over.</i>

25:22.904 --> 25:25.038
<i>That way, all of our
minds can be put at ease.</i>

25:25.072 --> 25:28.305
No, I do not need...
I do not need an escort.

25:28.339 --> 25:32.176
There's no shame in it. It's
a dangerous world out there.

25:34.276 --> 25:37.179
Thank you, sir. That's
very generous of you, sir.

25:37.213 --> 25:39.279
It is my pleasure.

25:39.313 --> 25:42.481
It's done. Let's eat.

25:44.483 --> 25:47.385
- Hewlett: <i>Worth waiting for.</i>
- Richard: <i> Yes, isn't it?</i>

25:53.659 --> 25:56.158
"I believe that it is better
to die honorably in the field

25:56.240 --> 25:58.272
- than in a stinking hospital."
- I concur with that.

25:58.306 --> 26:01.073
Men: Cheers.

26:01.688 --> 26:04.188
And this, this here, truer still.

26:04.223 --> 26:07.557
Listen. "I believe that the
proper methods of attacking,

26:07.592 --> 26:09.227
beating and conquering the enemy

26:09.261 --> 26:11.898
has never as yet been adopted
by the commander-in-chief."

26:11.932 --> 26:14.302
I couldn't have said it better myself, boys.

26:14.337 --> 26:15.972
Who do you think is the author?

26:16.006 --> 26:17.641
<i>Someone fed up,</i>

26:17.676 --> 26:19.578
armed with common sense and
the courage to speak out.

26:19.612 --> 26:22.316
Oi, Bradford.

26:22.350 --> 26:24.955
You might want to be more careful with that.

26:24.989 --> 26:27.887
Your anonymous hero makes common sense

26:27.922 --> 26:29.589
sound a bit like treason.

26:29.623 --> 26:31.560
<i>That's your commander</i> <i>that he's hacking at.</i>

26:31.595 --> 26:33.299
Not for much longer, I think.

26:34.534 --> 26:36.767
What? What did you just say?

26:39.573 --> 26:43.640
This letter is well-formed
opinion based on fact.

26:43.674 --> 26:46.309
<i>Our esteemed commander</i>

26:46.343 --> 26:48.947
left his flank wide open at Brandywine.

26:48.981 --> 26:52.383
He lost the battle, cost
America her capital city.

26:52.418 --> 26:55.018
Is it treason to speak the
facts in this army now?

26:55.053 --> 26:57.619
Fine. So...

26:57.653 --> 26:59.284
who would you see as commander?

26:59.318 --> 27:02.052
Congress would likely choose Gates.

27:02.086 --> 27:03.855
Gates, right.

27:03.889 --> 27:07.526
Sure, or perhaps your man

27:07.561 --> 27:09.732
- Charles Lee.
- Stand back.

27:09.766 --> 27:12.868
Who was captured while
with his mistress... fact.

27:12.902 --> 27:14.838
Who escaped the enemy on his own.

27:14.872 --> 27:17.076
What was she, a tavern wench?

27:17.110 --> 27:19.145
No wonder he's been so absent in the field.

27:19.180 --> 27:21.247
He's too busy playing with his whore pipe.

27:21.281 --> 27:24.017
At least he has one.
And the sons to prove it.

27:24.052 --> 27:27.089
While poor George must content
himself with collecting young men.

27:27.123 --> 27:29.159
Why, you...

27:37.971 --> 27:40.174
Hold him down. Hold him down.

27:42.244 --> 27:45.146
Now we're gonna shut that pretty mouth.

27:45.180 --> 27:46.815
With respect, sir,

27:46.849 --> 27:49.950
the only one who punches my friend is me.

27:49.985 --> 27:51.184
Hey.

27:51.219 --> 27:53.286
(Groans)

27:57.726 --> 27:59.595
You like that, huh?

28:02.537 --> 28:03.805
(Spits)

28:10.915 --> 28:13.817
Wait, Caleb. Hey there, boy.

28:16.523 --> 28:18.561
Thank you.

28:18.595 --> 28:21.264
And you were right. You
were right about Culper.

28:21.299 --> 28:25.001
It's not safe to make
contact unless he's signaled.

28:25.035 --> 28:28.338
I won't move without you, all right?

28:30.776 --> 28:32.809
Are you all right?

28:32.843 --> 28:35.512
Yeah, it's just a scratch.

28:35.547 --> 28:37.683
Are you all right, though?

28:40.319 --> 28:42.855
What, have I really been such an ass?

28:42.889 --> 28:45.092
Well, yeah. You have.

28:45.126 --> 28:46.694
(laughs)

28:46.729 --> 28:49.532
I wish I could just walk up
and ask that of Washington.

28:49.567 --> 28:51.331
"Are you all right, sir?"

28:51.366 --> 28:54.069
The man won't stand up for
himself against his detractors.

28:54.103 --> 28:57.171
I cannot for the life of me understand why.

28:58.374 --> 29:00.276
Well, you know these officer types.

29:00.310 --> 29:02.045
Hmm?

29:02.079 --> 29:04.577
Always under pressure, shouldering burdens

29:04.611 --> 29:07.249
us foot-wobblers don't know or can't see.

29:07.284 --> 29:08.985
Huh?

29:09.019 --> 29:11.385
Maybe give him some slack.

29:15.158 --> 29:17.927
(Singing drunkenly)

29:17.961 --> 29:19.629
Shh. Thomas.

29:19.663 --> 29:21.634
I just don't understand, Richard,

29:21.668 --> 29:23.571
why we haven't done this before.

29:23.606 --> 29:25.906
You didn't want to be celebrated.

29:25.941 --> 29:30.310
Ah, well, I am lifting the embargo on that.

29:30.344 --> 29:33.078
In the meantime, God night.

29:33.112 --> 29:36.215
- And good bless.
- (Laughs)

29:58.581 --> 30:00.516
Where's Thomas?

30:00.551 --> 30:03.652
He's asleep downstairs. Aberdeen's with him.

30:10.757 --> 30:12.721
Don't you think we should talk?

30:12.755 --> 30:15.924
I think everyone had a splendid evening.

30:15.958 --> 30:18.192
Just a splendid evening, wouldn't you agree?

30:19.127 --> 30:20.326
<i>Almost everyone.</i>

30:20.361 --> 30:22.327
<i>Well, I know I did.</i>

30:22.361 --> 30:25.365
Dinner, drinks, and the
theater all in one night.

30:26.801 --> 30:28.767
I thought your performance was excellent.

30:28.801 --> 30:30.834
I learned from the best.

30:30.868 --> 30:32.367
Touché.

30:34.236 --> 30:36.805
(Clears throat)

30:43.014 --> 30:45.482
An armed escort with me at all times.

30:45.516 --> 30:47.050
Very clever.

30:47.085 --> 30:51.486
Abraham, please.

30:51.520 --> 30:53.922
I don't feel very clever and I
don't wish to be your adversary.

30:53.957 --> 30:56.461
Oh, no, don't be hasty
'cause you got a talent for it.

30:56.495 --> 30:57.932
And I mean that to your credit.

30:57.966 --> 30:59.299
You're much more than the blushing rose

30:59.333 --> 31:00.832
my brother first told me about.

31:00.867 --> 31:02.500
And you, you are a far
more interesting husband

31:02.534 --> 31:04.236
than the cabbage farmer that I was wed to.

31:04.270 --> 31:06.571
Well, then we make a
perfect couple, don't we?

31:09.874 --> 31:14.109
If you hate me, just say it straight out.

31:14.143 --> 31:16.677
There's no longer a need to be
hiding the truth from each other.

31:16.710 --> 31:19.378
We've both suffered the consequence of that.

31:24.451 --> 31:27.350
You're a God-fearing man.
I know that, Abraham.

31:27.385 --> 31:30.986
Our savior has tested us and
has given us a second chance.

31:31.020 --> 31:32.919
And I had hoped and I had prayed

31:32.953 --> 31:35.354
that the death of Ensign Baker, a good man,

31:35.388 --> 31:37.191
- an innocent man...
- Mary, we're...

31:37.226 --> 31:38.957
would have opened your eyes
to the folly of these schemes.

31:38.991 --> 31:41.426
We are not talking about
Ensign Baker right now.

31:41.461 --> 31:43.196
Did his death mean nothing to you?

31:43.230 --> 31:46.699
No, his death meant everything!
It changed everything!

31:46.734 --> 31:49.303
I had tried at every step to do right,

31:49.337 --> 31:52.605
to protect my family,
to stand for my principles,

31:52.639 --> 31:54.309
to stay out of the fight and true to myself.

31:54.343 --> 31:57.677
And Baker is the bloody
proof that I cannot do both.

31:57.711 --> 32:00.511
Now, if I stop now, his
death will mean nothing.

32:00.546 --> 32:02.280
Abraham, please, you're hurting me.

32:02.315 --> 32:03.982
He should never have been in our house

32:04.016 --> 32:05.450
just as Hewlett should not be now.

32:05.484 --> 32:06.951
We do not need their laws,

32:06.986 --> 32:08.486
their taxes, or their protection.

32:08.520 --> 32:12.157
And I will not stop my
mission for Washington

32:12.192 --> 32:15.093
until the last king's man
has set sail back to England.

32:15.128 --> 32:17.094
Now, do you understand?

32:19.066 --> 32:21.735
Who will protect us from King Louis

32:21.769 --> 32:23.370
when his ships return to reclaim New France?

32:23.404 --> 32:24.804
You've been speaking to my father again.

32:24.839 --> 32:26.306
You asked what I believe in.

32:26.340 --> 32:27.973
Then why don't you just turn me in?

32:28.007 --> 32:30.940
Abraham, don't you know?

32:30.975 --> 32:33.945
Sometime during that night while
I was watching our house burn,

32:33.979 --> 32:37.749
it became clear to me
and it brought me peace.

32:38.818 --> 32:41.386
I love you, Abraham.

32:42.888 --> 32:44.589
I love your strength to stand on your own

32:44.623 --> 32:47.193
no matter what anyone else thinks.

32:47.227 --> 32:49.897
I love the way that you care for our son.

32:51.133 --> 32:53.836
I love your lips and I love your eyes.

32:56.307 --> 32:58.972
And I will do what I must to protect you.

32:59.007 --> 33:02.475
Even if that means
protecting you from yourself.

33:04.212 --> 33:05.976
Mary...

33:09.014 --> 33:10.848
I don't feel the same.

33:10.883 --> 33:12.649
I know.

33:14.282 --> 33:16.350
I know.

33:21.220 --> 33:23.621
It's not as bad as I feared.

33:24.792 --> 33:27.425
And I did fear that for so long.

33:32.732 --> 33:36.801
You may go to New York to
study the law, Abraham.

33:36.835 --> 33:39.771
But I'm afraid that's all
you'll have time for there.

34:04.360 --> 34:07.931
- Woodhull.
- Corporal Eastin.

34:08.967 --> 34:10.268
On your way to post?

34:10.303 --> 34:11.935
You are my post.

34:11.969 --> 34:14.672
I'm your new escort per Major Hewlett.

34:16.507 --> 34:19.076
Oh, excellent. I see.

34:19.110 --> 34:22.914
Well, when I'm ready to travel,
I'll be sure to let you know.

34:22.947 --> 34:25.315
My orders are to not
let you out of my sight.

34:25.349 --> 34:26.949
For your own safety.

34:26.983 --> 34:29.719
I think I'm safe here in Setauket.

34:31.956 --> 34:33.757
Are you?

34:48.839 --> 34:51.574
(Chatter)

34:55.777 --> 34:59.581
"That the enemy has been greatly deceived

34:59.616 --> 35:04.154
having no reason to
expect so valuable a prize

35:04.188 --> 35:05.991
<i>as the city of Philadelphia</i>

35:06.026 --> 35:08.961
<i>with so few broken bones."</i>

35:08.995 --> 35:11.132
Tell me, monsieur,

35:11.167 --> 35:14.507
do you have gutter
journalists in your country?

35:14.541 --> 35:19.782
In France we would have
them thrown in the Bastille.

35:19.817 --> 35:23.453
General Lee, what do you read there?

35:24.289 --> 35:25.857
Lee: <i>What, this?</i>

35:27.227 --> 35:29.830
Just a complaint, sir.

35:29.865 --> 35:32.265
<i>Factional, anonymous.</i>

35:32.300 --> 35:34.533
You don't want to read it, trust me.

35:34.568 --> 35:36.500
You read it, then.

35:37.567 --> 35:38.768
Please.

35:42.470 --> 35:45.239
Lee: <i> Sir.</i> <i>(clears throat)</i>

35:45.273 --> 35:47.476
"I believe that some people

35:47.511 --> 35:50.745
have too much interest in
the continuance of the war

35:50.780 --> 35:54.352
and that the head cannot possibly be sound

35:54.386 --> 35:57.891
<i>when the whole body is disordered.</i>

35:57.925 --> 36:01.063
<i>That Washington, the bastard of Brandywine,</i>

36:01.097 --> 36:04.135
<i>should be flogged for his failure.</i>

36:04.170 --> 36:07.972
That the people of America
have been guilty of idolatry

36:08.006 --> 36:10.777
by making a man their god.

36:10.811 --> 36:14.181
<i>And the God of heaven and earth</i>

36:14.216 --> 36:16.918
will convince them by woeful experience

36:16.952 --> 36:18.587
that he is only a man."

36:18.621 --> 36:21.323
<i>(footsteps)</i>

36:23.657 --> 36:25.760
Forgive me.

36:25.795 --> 36:28.762
Please, do continue.

36:28.797 --> 36:32.498
<i>A greater load of horseshit
I've not heard dropped in years.</i>

36:32.532 --> 36:34.999
Here.

36:35.033 --> 36:37.267
Let me. (scoffs)

36:37.301 --> 36:40.669
"That the honorable Congress... " ha!

36:40.703 --> 36:45.105
"... In many cases has been too much led

36:45.140 --> 36:46.840
by military men."

36:46.874 --> 36:49.108
Do you agree with that, Charles?

36:49.143 --> 36:51.110
(Scoffs) Of course not.

36:51.144 --> 36:53.811
Man: <i>No? Oh, I do.</i>

36:53.846 --> 36:56.948
Those squeeze crabs in Congress

36:56.982 --> 37:00.019
have been misled by military men,

37:00.054 --> 37:01.589
just the wrong kind.

37:01.623 --> 37:03.823
<i>They'd be better off listening to a man</i>

37:03.857 --> 37:06.460
who'd venture into a cold night
and come back with a victory.

37:06.495 --> 37:09.166
But don't take my word for it.

37:09.200 --> 37:11.900
I'm just the poor son of a drunkard.

37:11.935 --> 37:14.907
A mere pharmacist's apprentice

37:14.941 --> 37:18.010
and thveteran of only 11 battles

37:18.045 --> 37:21.013
<i>in this conflict for our freedom.</i>

37:21.048 --> 37:23.750
Now, of course, we cannot know

37:23.785 --> 37:26.952
who wrote this grub shite,

37:26.986 --> 37:30.156
but I would gamble he is
not the equal of a commander

37:30.190 --> 37:32.223
<i>who rides headlong in the fray</i>

37:32.257 --> 37:35.224
and yet has never been shot nor captured.

37:36.559 --> 37:38.924
An endorsement by the
God of heaven and earth

37:38.959 --> 37:41.492
- if there ever was one.
- Hear, hear!

37:41.527 --> 37:43.726
(Pounding)

37:48.663 --> 37:51.999
Monsieur, may I introduce to you

37:52.033 --> 37:54.635
General Benedict Arnold.

37:54.670 --> 37:57.803
General, this is Theveneau de Francy

37:57.838 --> 38:00.808
of the Roderigue Hortalez Company.

38:00.843 --> 38:03.112
Bonjour.

38:04.247 --> 38:06.581
Will you join us, General?

38:10.351 --> 38:12.522
Oh, sir, please.

38:17.663 --> 38:19.866
It is an honor, sir.

38:27.772 --> 38:29.606
Do you still have an appetite?

38:29.640 --> 38:32.105
Always.

38:41.347 --> 38:43.916
<i>(Thunder crashing)</i>

38:46.577 --> 38:49.581
There is something I did not say

38:49.615 --> 38:52.884
when I made my proposal to go to New York.

38:52.918 --> 38:56.485
Something I kept hidden
and you should know it.

38:56.520 --> 38:59.055
You should know that I intended

38:59.090 --> 39:01.154
to undertake a completely different task.

39:03.490 --> 39:06.926
One far more dangerous
and far less honorable.

39:08.631 --> 39:10.531
<i>As you may know,</i>

39:10.566 --> 39:13.801
<i>I never graduated King's College.</i>

39:13.835 --> 39:18.876
What you may not know,
what no one knows is...

39:18.910 --> 39:21.677
while at King's I had a connection.

39:23.548 --> 39:25.283
A shameful, misguided friendship

39:25.317 --> 39:28.452
with several members of a
secret group of Patriots.

39:30.357 --> 39:33.224
They called themselves the Sons of Liberty.

39:34.458 --> 39:37.161
It's not a past that I am proud of.

39:38.764 --> 39:40.832
But it is one that could be of use now.

39:46.708 --> 39:48.572
You were right

39:48.606 --> 39:50.374
<i>about the danger that we face.</i>

39:50.408 --> 39:53.279
<i>There are traitors everywhere.</i>

39:53.313 --> 39:55.483
Now I wish to uproot them from the ground

39:55.517 --> 39:58.585
before they strike my family again.

39:58.620 --> 40:00.522
Uproot them how?

40:00.557 --> 40:03.428
I believe that the Sons of Liberty
may still be operating in New York,

40:03.462 --> 40:07.063
albeit concealed underground.

40:07.098 --> 40:09.332
If I can find them,

40:09.366 --> 40:12.101
convince them that I'm still on their side,

40:12.136 --> 40:15.508
I can deliver you the
names of the whole group.

40:17.510 --> 40:19.741
You wish to act the Patriot?

40:19.776 --> 40:23.745
In order to catch traitors,
I must play one myself, yes.

40:27.419 --> 40:30.823
Of course, it...

40:30.858 --> 40:34.494
it won't do to have Corporal Eastin
standing guard while I do so.

40:34.529 --> 40:36.295
He may still accompany me to the city,

40:36.329 --> 40:39.197
but in order to keep up appearances,

40:39.231 --> 40:41.334
I must act alone.

40:41.368 --> 40:44.770
Are not the Sons of Liberty

40:44.805 --> 40:47.740
the same cabal that sparked
the Liberty Pole Riots?

40:47.775 --> 40:51.910
The same men who murdered
your older brother Thomas?

40:51.945 --> 40:54.380
Well, you see now why I must do this.

40:54.414 --> 40:57.016
<i>And why I beg you not to tell my father.</i>

40:57.050 --> 40:59.519
<i>He may never speak to me again
if he were to learn of my past.</i>

40:59.553 --> 41:01.954
He may never speak to you
again if you should die

41:01.989 --> 41:04.557
while exposing the rebels or
while masquerading as one.

41:04.591 --> 41:06.659
I will not sit home in safety and comfort

41:06.694 --> 41:08.660
while others are dying for their beliefs.

41:08.695 --> 41:10.763
I took an oath in your presence

41:10.797 --> 41:13.634
swearing to defeat any treasonous
conspiracies made against the king.

41:13.668 --> 41:14.969
Now, please...

41:17.838 --> 41:20.105
let me fulfill my oath.

41:39.660 --> 41:42.130
- <i> (Footsteps)</i>
- <i> (Horse neighs)</i>

41:43.866 --> 41:46.432
A wee bit late for visitors, isn't it?

41:46.466 --> 41:48.866
You wish to see His Majesty or not?

42:20.690 --> 42:23.157
Your Majesty,

42:23.191 --> 42:25.125
it is a most distinguishing honor

42:25.160 --> 42:28.296
to stand in your royal presence once more.

42:28.330 --> 42:31.468
I do hope you recall the warm spirit

42:31.502 --> 42:36.140
of my prior audience just 14 years ago.

42:36.175 --> 42:39.745
The same season you enjoyed my accounts

42:39.780 --> 42:44.153
of the methods used to trap a black bear

42:44.188 --> 42:47.258
in his winter den, eh? (laughs)

42:49.296 --> 42:53.134
I also hope that you recall

42:53.168 --> 42:55.738
<i>my petition.</i>

42:55.772 --> 42:59.209
That being the discovery

42:59.243 --> 43:01.276
of the Northwest Passage

43:01.311 --> 43:04.380
and claiming it for England.

43:04.415 --> 43:07.049
I humbly submit to you

43:07.084 --> 43:09.550
this proposal tonight.

43:09.585 --> 43:14.118
It is said that you are the best
hunter and tracker in America

43:14.152 --> 43:16.519
and that you are a...

43:17.754 --> 43:19.754
killing gentleman.

43:19.789 --> 43:24.657
You will be granted a charter to
discover the Northwest Passage.

43:24.691 --> 43:27.561
You will be appointed
command to raise troops.

43:27.595 --> 43:30.927
<i>You will serve on full pay as a major.</i>

43:30.962 --> 43:35.332
And all your debts will
be cleared by the Crown.

43:35.366 --> 43:39.168
There is a valuable piece of royal property

43:39.203 --> 43:41.637
on a ship bound for New York.

43:41.671 --> 43:45.307
It is concealed inside a waxwork.

43:45.341 --> 43:47.976
- Concealed?
- It was stolen from the palace,

43:48.010 --> 43:50.412
and must be recovered before it falls

43:50.447 --> 43:53.817
<i>into the hands of the rebel army.</i>

43:53.851 --> 43:57.086
And it must never fall
into the hands of France.

43:58.289 --> 43:59.956
Never.

44:01.757 --> 44:03.724
You are to find it and destroy it

44:03.759 --> 44:06.829
along with anyone else
that may have seen it.

44:27.725 --> 44:30.090
By my honor,

44:30.123 --> 44:32.291
I will see it done.
