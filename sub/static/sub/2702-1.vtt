01:37.664 --> 01:41.031
Boss, I need
a bathroom break!

01:41.067 --> 01:43.968
Please.

01:53.379 --> 01:55.472
Dear Lord, help me!

02:09.895 --> 02:11.329
Get the hell
out of here.

02:15.668 --> 02:20.537
Well, that's what you get
for drinking on the job, Sloane.

02:20.573 --> 02:22.404
Hey, Sloane, take it easy!

02:24.244 --> 02:28.510
Sloane! Sloane!
Damn it! Sloane!

02:29.516 --> 02:32.110
You can do it!

02:36.923 --> 02:40.723
Sloane.
Sloane.

02:48.368 --> 02:50.268
Uhh...

02:51.838 --> 02:54.898
Dear God help us.

03:42.388 --> 03:45.687
# Hush, little baby,
don't say a word #

03:45.725 --> 03:48.216
# Mama's gonna buy you... #

03:50.196 --> 03:53.063
He's so beautiful.

03:54.767 --> 03:57.201
That's the ugliest thing
I ever saw.

04:45.251 --> 04:47.219
Don't worry about it, Tommy.

04:47.253 --> 04:51.417
You don't have to look pretty
to work down at the slaughterhouse.

06:58.851 --> 07:02.184
What is that diseased freak
still doing out here?

07:02.221 --> 07:04.451
We closed for good now.

07:04.490 --> 07:06.720
Uh, I think
he likes it here, sir.

07:06.759 --> 07:09.956
Ain't no reason for that
ugly beast to still be here.

07:09.996 --> 07:13.454
Jess, we need to get that oversized
retard the hell out of here.

07:14.734 --> 07:16.827
We, sir?

07:16.869 --> 07:18.097
Just you.

07:29.315 --> 07:31.215
Hello, Hewitt.

07:33.920 --> 07:35.615
We're shutting down
the place today.

07:35.655 --> 07:37.282
You know that
'cause I done told you.

07:37.323 --> 07:39.314
Shutting down for good.

07:39.358 --> 07:42.521
We ain't packing
no more meat.

07:42.562 --> 07:44.962
Ain't killing
no more animals so...

07:46.866 --> 07:51.360
you just leave the equipment.
You just get on home now, okay?

07:51.404 --> 07:57.365
You gotta go, I said!

07:57.410 --> 07:59.970
You gotta get the hell out
of here, you dumb animal!

08:37.750 --> 08:39.240
What are you doing?

08:41.888 --> 08:45.255
Shh! Keep your voice down.

08:45.291 --> 08:47.418
This is how you
sneak up on 'em,

08:47.460 --> 08:50.395
- how you catch 'em.
- Catch who?

08:51.964 --> 08:55.058
Gooks in the swamp.

08:55.101 --> 08:57.592
Eric, the only thing you're
gonna catch in this water is disease.

08:59.539 --> 09:02.667
- Chrissie, come on.
- No, I'm not going in that water.

09:02.708 --> 09:04.198
Consider it the last
wish of a soldier.

09:04.243 --> 09:06.040
Oh, no.

09:06.078 --> 09:09.013
No, you've been getting last wishes
this whole past week, G.I. Joe.

09:09.048 --> 09:12.245
And you call
yourself a patriot.

09:12.285 --> 09:14.378
- You know what I think is patriotic?
- What?

09:14.420 --> 09:18.789
Me driving you across
state to go to Vietnam. Again.

09:18.824 --> 09:20.086
You goin' all the way
to Vietnam, baby?

09:20.126 --> 09:22.321
No, honey, base camp's
far enough for me, trust me.

09:25.264 --> 09:27.357
Just try to relax, baby,

09:27.400 --> 09:30.836
'cause today I'm
going to use my tongue

09:30.870 --> 09:32.963
in ways the Lord
never intended.

09:33.005 --> 09:36.065
- How's that sound?
- Okay.

09:36.108 --> 09:38.668
# All right now #

09:38.711 --> 09:43.045
# Baby,
it's all right now #

09:43.082 --> 09:44.447
# Whoa... #

09:44.483 --> 09:46.542
Mmm...

09:46.586 --> 09:49.578
# Let me tell you now #

09:53.225 --> 09:57.855
# I took her home
to my place #

09:57.897 --> 10:00.024
# Watching every move
on her face... #

10:00.066 --> 10:02.591
This may come as a shock
to you, but most men

10:02.635 --> 10:04.762
are into this
kind of thing.

10:07.039 --> 10:08.267
I'm sorry.

10:11.277 --> 10:13.472
I'm just a little distracted, Bail.

10:16.115 --> 10:18.447
I mean, I just
keep thinking,

10:18.484 --> 10:20.475
how does a person
go back there?

10:20.519 --> 10:22.214
You know,
how do you do that?

10:22.254 --> 10:25.314
It doesn't make him any more
heroic than you, baby, okay?

10:27.793 --> 10:29.852
Yeah, but he thinks I'm
going with him, Bail.

10:29.895 --> 10:34.127
Eric thinks I'm going
to Vietnam with him.

10:34.166 --> 10:37.897
Well, he's your brother,
he loves you.

10:37.937 --> 10:40.963
You know, he'll
get over it, okay?

10:44.910 --> 10:46.377
Just close your eyes.

10:46.412 --> 10:49.381
Let me see your hand.

10:49.415 --> 10:51.508
You're gonna love this.

10:51.550 --> 10:53.040
Can I look?

10:53.085 --> 10:55.076
Yeah.

10:57.089 --> 10:59.751
Eric, you got that
from a Cracker Jack box!

10:59.792 --> 11:02.522
Wha... I... I had to eat
17 batches to find the one I wanted.

11:05.031 --> 11:07.431
How many?

11:07.466 --> 11:10.492
- Two.
- Okay, girls or boys?

11:10.536 --> 11:13.096
One of each.

11:13.139 --> 11:14.572
And what are
their names?

11:14.607 --> 11:18.134
- Bonnie and Clyde.
- No.

11:18.177 --> 11:20.873
- Come on.
- Bobby and Janis.

11:20.913 --> 11:23.643
And where are
us and the kids gonna live?

11:23.683 --> 11:27.244
California.
Right by the water.

11:37.063 --> 11:38.553
Don't leave me.

11:40.199 --> 11:43.327
I ain't never gonna
leave you, beautiful.

11:43.369 --> 11:47.703
I'll give you everything
you want, baby.

11:47.740 --> 11:49.537
Starting with this.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.440
This is what
you're gonna tell him...

11:53.479 --> 11:56.107
you're going to walk
right up to Eric,

11:56.148 --> 11:58.378
and you're gonna tell him
that you're going to Mexico

11:58.417 --> 12:00.749
and you're not gonna join
him in this stupid war,

12:00.786 --> 12:03.220
no matter what some
draft card says.

12:03.255 --> 12:05.018
Okay?

12:07.893 --> 12:10.987
Get your bony ass ready, soldier!
Moving out at 1700 hours.

12:11.030 --> 12:13.555
What's 1700 hours?

12:13.599 --> 12:16.227
You better be
getting some, Dean.

12:34.086 --> 12:36.213
What the hell are you
still doing here?

12:36.255 --> 12:38.120
Go home.
We're out of business.

12:38.157 --> 12:40.057
You and your family are
the only ones stupid enough

12:40.092 --> 12:41.423
to still be living
in this town.

12:41.460 --> 12:43.587
Your kind belong
in this shithole.

13:02.848 --> 13:05.510
Operator.

13:05.551 --> 13:06.916
May I help you?

13:10.623 --> 13:12.955
You're gonna have to speak
more clearly, ma'am.

13:15.161 --> 13:18.460
I don't understand. You're gonna have
to speak more clearly.

13:18.497 --> 13:20.124
I'm your friend, Hewitt.

13:56.235 --> 13:59.033
Come on, y'all. Look alive now.

13:59.071 --> 14:00.766
Take one last look
at that motel over there

14:00.806 --> 14:02.637
'cause this here's your
lodging for the next two days.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.768
What, are you gonna put
mints on our pillows too?

14:04.810 --> 14:06.710
I'll tuck you in
special every night.

14:16.155 --> 14:18.214
We're going
on a road trip!

14:18.257 --> 14:21.715
# Hey well, I'm the friendly
stranger in the black sedan #

14:21.760 --> 14:24.092
# Won't you hop inside
my car? #

14:24.129 --> 14:26.893
# Got peaches, got candy,
I'm a loveable man #

14:26.932 --> 14:28.422
# Take you
to the nearest star #

14:28.467 --> 14:30.230
- # And I'll love you #
- # Love you #

14:30.269 --> 14:31.827
- # I'll need you #
- # Need you #

14:31.871 --> 14:33.862
# I want you,
got to have you, child #

14:33.906 --> 14:38.741
# Great God in heaven
you know I love you... #

14:40.079 --> 14:41.444
So what are you
gonna miss the most?

14:41.480 --> 14:42.879
- Hmm?
- When you're gone,

14:42.915 --> 14:44.576
what are you
gonna miss the most?

14:44.617 --> 14:46.209
Fishing for
compliments here?

14:46.252 --> 14:47.742
No, never.

14:47.786 --> 14:49.947
- She is fishing.
- I am not.

14:49.989 --> 14:51.286
Come on, tell me.

14:51.323 --> 14:54.019
Besides you?

14:54.059 --> 14:55.856
Nothing.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.056
I mean, family
and all, sure,

14:58.097 --> 15:00.759
but Dean's gonna be
right there with me.

15:00.799 --> 15:03.825
- Right, Deano?
- Hoo-ha.

15:11.143 --> 15:12.576
Oh, cool!

15:12.611 --> 15:14.636
Don't you just love
a man on a motorcycle?

15:14.680 --> 15:16.614
It's like Peter Fonda
in "Easy Rider."

15:16.649 --> 15:18.139
- Hey guys, don't stare.
- Coming up fast.

15:18.183 --> 15:19.775
Y'all, don't stare at them.

15:21.287 --> 15:22.754
Baby, they're coming
a little too close.

15:22.788 --> 15:24.221
Whoa whoa whoa.

15:25.624 --> 15:26.886
Stop it!

15:27.927 --> 15:29.224
Hey!
Fuck you!

15:31.931 --> 15:35.059
Hey, we better get out of here.
Get down.

15:37.503 --> 15:39.664
Hey! Get off, asshole.

15:41.073 --> 15:42.370
Drive faster!

15:56.555 --> 15:58.546
Man, what the hell's
your problem?

15:59.925 --> 16:01.222
- You okay, baby?
- Yeah.

16:01.260 --> 16:02.818
- You're all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

16:38.030 --> 16:41.557
- Thomas in there?
- No, he ain't here.

16:41.600 --> 16:46.333
We got a... we got a situation
on our hands here.

16:46.372 --> 16:49.068
I just came back
from the slaughterhouse.

16:49.108 --> 16:51.975
That 'tarded nephew
of yours killed a man.

16:52.011 --> 16:54.878
Now I'm gonna have
to apprehend him.

16:54.913 --> 16:57.006
I thought you might
want to accompany me,

16:57.049 --> 17:00.280
help finesse the situation,
as it were.

17:04.923 --> 17:07.117
You know what else
Jesse was saying?

17:07.159 --> 17:09.888
Honestly, he tells me
that you can bring a horse

17:09.928 --> 17:11.862
to "organism"
using your finger.

17:11.896 --> 17:14.763
You believe that shit?
No, it's what he said.

17:14.800 --> 17:17.462
Who's the fool that tested
that theory out, I'd like to know?

17:17.502 --> 17:19.367
God damn, I wouldn't
mind doing it.

17:19.405 --> 17:21.031
But I'm just saying,
a bunch of sore horses

17:21.073 --> 17:22.733
running around
out in some farm...

17:24.410 --> 17:26.742
Anyway, staying
around this town,

17:26.779 --> 17:28.644
there's no more jobs,
no more money,

17:28.680 --> 17:31.308
no more food.
It's downright suicidal.

17:31.350 --> 17:34.444
And I'm the last bit
of law enforcement that's left.

17:34.486 --> 17:37.216
Hell, I'm moving
to Michigan next week.

17:37.256 --> 17:41.818
I often ask myself,
"What makes a man a killer?"

17:41.860 --> 17:45.193
I don't mind saying:
You raised that retard right,

17:45.230 --> 17:47.460
me and you, we ain't
taking this drive right now.

17:47.499 --> 17:50.491
You can't have a creature
like that around normal folk,

17:50.536 --> 17:54.199
- that's what I'm saying.
- He ain't retarded. He's misunderstood.

17:55.641 --> 17:58.474
Oh, shit, there he is!
Jesus Christ.

18:00.779 --> 18:02.610
You stay put.

18:02.648 --> 18:04.206
I'll let you know
when I need you.

18:04.249 --> 18:06.649
Put down the weapon, boy!

18:08.987 --> 18:11.046
I seen what you did
back there, Hewitt.

18:11.090 --> 18:14.924
This doesn't have to be difficult
unless'n you make it so.

18:14.960 --> 18:16.689
Just put the weapon down.

18:16.728 --> 18:20.255
Don't be stupid.

18:24.736 --> 18:26.567
I think we've got
a problem, Sheriff.

18:36.248 --> 18:40.082
Shit, I just killed the whole
fucking sheriff's department.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.280
Damn, I wondered
what that felt like.

19:32.471 --> 19:36.737
You really think you're something
in that outfit, don't you?

19:36.775 --> 19:40.802
Here's your pants.
Supper's on the table.

19:44.683 --> 19:48.346
Ladies love
a man in uniform.

19:53.091 --> 19:57.619
That slaughterhouse meant more to this
town than them fools will ever know.

19:57.663 --> 19:59.893
Just a matter of time now

19:59.932 --> 20:03.561
before this town's overrun
by bikers and hippies.

20:03.602 --> 20:06.264
Most families
have already fled.

20:06.305 --> 20:08.933
Well, I say
let 'em go.

20:08.974 --> 20:12.842
Let them flee to the hills
and the cities

20:12.878 --> 20:17.281
that pollute our air,
and our water and our minds.

20:17.316 --> 20:20.752
Us, we're staying
right here.

20:20.786 --> 20:25.382
The ashes
of six generations of Hewitts

20:25.424 --> 20:28.416
have been tilled
into the soil of this farm.

20:28.460 --> 20:32.658
We will never abandon
the place of our birth.

20:34.199 --> 20:37.066
We're on our own
now, people.

20:37.102 --> 20:39.297
And alone

20:39.338 --> 20:42.466
we will
rise above it all.

20:42.507 --> 20:46.944
People may not remember
what we say here tonight,

20:46.979 --> 20:51.382
but they sure as shit
gonna remember what we do.

20:51.416 --> 20:53.384
Thanks to
the good sheriff here,

20:53.418 --> 20:56.114
we ain't gonna
go hungry tonight.

20:56.154 --> 20:58.122
Matter of fact,

20:58.156 --> 21:00.522
we ain't never
gonna starve again.

21:04.229 --> 21:06.220
Mm-mm-mm.

21:08.734 --> 21:12.261
Charlie, say grace.

21:12.304 --> 21:14.829
Mama, I told you
Charlie's dead.

21:14.873 --> 21:18.400
It's Hoyt now,
Sheriff Hoyt.

21:19.778 --> 21:23.111
Lord, thank You for all
this bounty that You've

21:23.148 --> 21:26.015
provided for us here
this evening. Amen.

21:28.620 --> 21:33.387
Tommy, you come on in here
and join us for supper.

21:33.425 --> 21:35.655
Come on now, son.

22:16.968 --> 22:19.266
Oh baby, look! Come on,
can we stop at that store?

22:19.304 --> 22:21.204
It's just like the one
in California. Please?

22:21.239 --> 22:23.264
Yeah yeah.

22:31.516 --> 22:33.313
Come on, Bail,
you'll love this.

22:33.352 --> 22:34.842
These places have tons of character.

22:56.408 --> 23:00.208
Y'all have some beautiful
things in here, ma'am.

23:00.245 --> 23:02.179
Okay...

23:08.987 --> 23:12.252
It'll take you a little while
to get used to things in 'Nam.

23:14.292 --> 23:15.691
The people,

23:15.727 --> 23:19.185
the smells, but...

23:19.231 --> 23:22.428
But what?

23:22.467 --> 23:25.129
You'd be amazed at the things
you can get used to.

23:27.439 --> 23:30.806
Um, is everything okay
with you and Dean?

23:30.842 --> 23:33.037
Uh, what do you mean?

23:33.078 --> 23:37.208
Bailey, come on. You guys have been
exchanging odd glances this whole trip.

23:37.249 --> 23:38.375
Oh...

23:41.153 --> 23:43.485
Excuse me, ma'am, can you tell me where
the bathroom is, please?

23:43.522 --> 23:46.719
Through the back.

23:52.264 --> 23:53.731
Pretty.

23:53.765 --> 23:58.668
But pretty only goes skin-deep.
Ugly is to the bone.

24:02.340 --> 24:04.001
Leave them be.

24:11.316 --> 24:12.749
Come on, Bailey.

24:12.784 --> 24:14.809
Look, we've been through
a lot together.

24:14.853 --> 24:16.184
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

24:18.757 --> 24:21.555
Me and Dean are
going to Mexico.

24:21.593 --> 24:23.857
He's not gonna
go with Eric.

24:23.895 --> 24:26.386
And uh, he's not
going to Vietnam.

24:26.431 --> 24:29.366
Chrissie...

24:29.401 --> 24:33.098
- what do you have to say?
- I say, go.

24:33.138 --> 24:36.130
Get the hell away from this war, okay?
Just cling to what you got.

24:36.174 --> 24:39.268
Then why are you
letting Eric go back?

24:39.311 --> 24:42.041
- It's just in him.
- What's in him?

24:42.080 --> 24:44.344
- The war.
- What do you mean?

24:44.382 --> 24:47.715
Look, you do something long enough,
eventually you start to like it.

24:47.752 --> 24:49.185
Hah!

24:51.890 --> 24:53.755
- Bitch.
- Scared the titties right off her.

24:56.928 --> 24:59.362
God damn it.

24:59.397 --> 25:00.694
Broke my mirror.

25:00.732 --> 25:03.758
You think the girls
are gonna be all right

25:03.802 --> 25:05.963
driving back alone
after they drop us off?

25:06.004 --> 25:09.462
Oh, I'm not worried
about them, Dean.

25:14.846 --> 25:16.746
Are you sure you got
nothing to tell me?

25:20.452 --> 25:23.216
Can we go?

25:23.255 --> 25:24.882
You all right?

25:24.923 --> 25:27.983
Yeah... let's just go.

25:37.802 --> 25:39.565
You didn't even buy anything, baby.

25:39.604 --> 25:43.700
Yeah, it was... it was nothing like
the one in California.

25:43.742 --> 25:46.711
I guess we'll just have to go back
to that one then.

25:52.517 --> 25:56.044
What are you
doing, man?

25:56.087 --> 25:58.385
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm not going, Eric.

25:58.423 --> 26:00.015
What do you mean,
you're not going?

26:00.058 --> 26:01.457
I'm not going, Eric!

26:04.496 --> 26:06.930
You think I don't
hear you at night, man,

26:06.965 --> 26:09.866
in your sleep, wailing from
what you've done over there?

26:09.901 --> 26:11.892
Now, how could you
want that for me?

26:11.937 --> 26:14.235
I'm glad Dad's
not here to see this.

26:14.272 --> 26:16.638
What, his son
the coward?

26:18.443 --> 26:20.138
Well, guess what, Eric,
I am not like you!

26:20.178 --> 26:22.009
All right?

26:22.047 --> 26:23.742
I am not ready for this shit!
I have no problem

26:23.782 --> 26:26.273
with the Vietcong over in
Vietnam or whatever...

26:26.318 --> 26:28.411
What the hell do you think
I'm going back for, huh?

26:28.453 --> 26:30.580
- I'm going back for you!
- Stop it!

26:32.791 --> 26:34.725
You think you're the only one who's
ever been scared?

26:34.759 --> 26:36.750
You think I wasn't scared?
You think I'm still not scared?

26:36.795 --> 26:37.819
Shut up!

26:39.631 --> 26:41.098
What does she want?

26:43.468 --> 26:45.629
Pull over!
Pull over!

26:45.670 --> 26:47.638
Oh God. Jesus Christ,
don't pull over!

26:47.672 --> 26:49.139
Shit, she's got a gun, Eric.

26:49.174 --> 26:50.971
Eric!

26:51.009 --> 26:54.103
Shut up!
Stay calm.

26:54.145 --> 26:56.670
- What are we gonna do?
- Eric, she's pulling...

26:59.184 --> 27:00.651
Oh my God!

27:02.020 --> 27:05.183
Look out!

27:22.507 --> 27:24.304
God...

27:26.911 --> 27:28.970
Chrissie.

27:38.690 --> 27:41.488
Buddy, Dean, Deano...

27:41.526 --> 27:45.428
I'm gonna get you help.
I'm gonna find Chrissie.

27:47.465 --> 27:48.591
Chrissie!

27:52.203 --> 27:54.569
Wow, man, I am impressed.

27:54.606 --> 27:57.006
- Y'all are tougher than I thought.
- What do you want from us?

27:57.042 --> 27:58.669
Oh... everything.

27:58.710 --> 28:03.204
How about we get this robbery thing
out of the way, huh?

28:17.595 --> 28:19.392
Fuck.

28:19.431 --> 28:24.095
You play along, and I won't have to kill
this fucking cop or you. Get up!

28:39.451 --> 28:41.009
I'm glad you're
here, officer.

28:41.052 --> 28:43.452
Oh, I just bet you are.

28:46.091 --> 28:48.321
Whoa!

28:52.764 --> 28:53.890
Sir.

28:53.932 --> 28:56.059
You sit down and
you stay right there.

29:01.272 --> 29:04.207
You kids okay?

29:04.242 --> 29:07.268
Why don't you step out
of the car, if you don't mind?

29:07.312 --> 29:10.076
- He shot her! He shot her!
- She can't move, sir. She needs help.

29:10.115 --> 29:12.276
Sir, I can't find
my girlfriend.

29:12.317 --> 29:14.979
Get a grip
on yourself, son.

29:15.019 --> 29:17.647
Sir, I can't find...

29:17.689 --> 29:20.852
Now, that was
for your own good.

29:23.228 --> 29:26.857
Okay, come on kids.
Let's get out of the car now.

29:26.898 --> 29:28.957
Sir, she's... she's really badly hurt.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.798
Right, well okay, kids.

29:31.836 --> 29:34.805
I'm gonna ask you nicely
one more time.

29:34.839 --> 29:39.640
Get out of the fuckin' car
or I'm gonna blow your fuckin' head off.

29:40.979 --> 29:45.313
Come on, you can make it.
Ooh-ee!

29:45.350 --> 29:48.046
You kids must have
been hauling ass.

29:48.086 --> 29:50.111
Look at the fucking
mess you made.

29:50.155 --> 29:53.613
Hey hey hey.
Come on now.

29:53.658 --> 29:55.353
I'm just here
to help you.

29:55.393 --> 29:57.623
Come on now.

29:57.662 --> 30:01.325
- Go on. I ain't gonna hurt you.
- Sir, sir, please.

30:01.366 --> 30:03.061
I'm not gonna
hurt you.

30:05.537 --> 30:08.904
You fucking motherfucker!

30:12.877 --> 30:15.971
See there? That didn't
even hurt, did it?

30:23.721 --> 30:25.882
There ain't no fire
in this accident.

30:25.924 --> 30:28.984
Which one of you assholes
burned his draft card?

30:29.027 --> 30:30.858
Get on over here, boys.

30:32.597 --> 30:35.191
- Come on, get over here.
- No.

30:35.233 --> 30:36.530
God damn it,
get over here!

30:42.607 --> 30:46.600
Which one of you boys'
name is Dean Hill?

30:50.114 --> 30:53.345
Honey, you're name
ain't Dean, is it?

31:02.961 --> 31:04.588
I am, sir...

31:04.629 --> 31:06.563
I'm Dean.

31:11.302 --> 31:15.602
Well, hey, dean.
Good to meet you.

31:15.640 --> 31:18.040
You kids took one

31:18.076 --> 31:21.273
big, nasty, giant shit

31:21.312 --> 31:24.145
right in my backyard.

31:24.182 --> 31:28.949
Now we do know that you're
a coward, right, Dean?

31:28.987 --> 31:32.115
I'm gonna to give you
a chance to die a hero.

31:36.060 --> 31:38.221
All right, get her in there,
God damn it.

31:38.263 --> 31:42.529
I'm starting to think you
like wasting my time, blondie.

31:42.567 --> 31:44.159
Hurry up!

31:51.075 --> 31:52.940
- I saw Chrissie.
- You did?

31:52.977 --> 31:54.604
She's okay.
Just don't say anything.

31:54.646 --> 31:56.614
- Where is she?
- Shut up.

32:23.274 --> 32:26.368
Hey, Monty, come pick up
this damn wreck.

32:26.411 --> 32:28.777
It's about a quarter mile
south of Hodd's place.

32:28.813 --> 32:31.509
There's a motorcycle too.

32:31.549 --> 32:35.815
Is having a dead biker chick ride
shotgun proper police procedure, sir?

32:37.422 --> 32:39.947
Honey, if that
was your mama,

32:39.991 --> 32:43.950
would you want me to stick her
in the trunk like a dead animal?

32:43.995 --> 32:45.826
I just think
this is bullshit.

32:45.863 --> 32:49.355
You got something to say
about this bullshit, do you, Dean?

32:49.400 --> 32:50.924
No, sir.

32:52.904 --> 32:55.464
You wouldn't lie to me,
would you, Dean?

34:17.522 --> 34:20.150
Where is the gun?

34:33.271 --> 34:35.795
You look through all this
shit on the road?

34:35.840 --> 34:39.900
Is that how we agreed you'd
address me over official FCC airwaves?

34:39.944 --> 34:42.674
No, "Sheriff."

35:16.514 --> 35:18.277
Oh...

35:20.585 --> 35:23.349
pretty little rascal,
ain't you?

35:55.086 --> 35:57.213
Don't you have to read us our rights
or something, Sheriff?

35:57.255 --> 35:59.815
Who in the hell put you assholes
in charge anyway?

35:59.857 --> 36:03.088
You see, that badge is
the authority around here.

36:03.127 --> 36:04.560
And I ask the questions.

36:06.831 --> 36:08.731
And what brings
you kids here?

36:10.601 --> 36:12.762
Sir, we were just
passing through,

36:12.803 --> 36:14.862
on my way
to reenlist, sir.

36:14.906 --> 36:18.000
A doughboy.
Hot damn.

36:18.042 --> 36:19.942
I was in the army myself
almost a year.

36:19.977 --> 36:21.638
Marines, sir.

36:21.679 --> 36:23.704
Six of one,
half dozen of the other.

36:23.748 --> 36:25.875
Heh, don't make
no damn difference.

36:25.917 --> 36:28.283
You look kind
of young to me.

36:28.319 --> 36:31.186
Where was you stationed?

36:31.222 --> 36:33.349
Vietnam, sir.

36:33.391 --> 36:37.418
Vietnam. Really?

36:38.829 --> 36:40.660
You kill any commies?

36:40.698 --> 36:43.929
Uh, a handful of gooks, sir.

36:47.004 --> 36:48.232
Where are you taking us?

36:48.272 --> 36:50.740
Where are you
taking us, sir?

36:52.176 --> 36:53.768
How was it over there?

36:56.080 --> 37:00.278
Well, it's a...
it's a different culture.

37:00.318 --> 37:03.913
But you'd be amazed at the things you
get used to over there, sir.

37:03.955 --> 37:06.150
You don't say.

37:11.495 --> 37:14.658
This the sheriff station?

37:14.699 --> 37:18.260
No, it's Mama's house.

37:26.577 --> 37:28.738
Oh! Don't even think
about it here.

37:35.253 --> 37:36.743
What are we
gonna do?

37:36.787 --> 37:39.722
I'm gonna kill
this motherfucker.

37:50.468 --> 37:52.095
Hey!

37:52.270 --> 37:56.639
You kids best not be making a mess
in my car or you'll clean it up.

37:57.675 --> 38:00.269
- He knows, Eric.
- What?

38:00.311 --> 38:01.835
He knows you're not me.

38:01.879 --> 38:03.676
- No, he doesn't, Dean.
- Hey, Tommy!

38:03.714 --> 38:05.409
- Stay the course.
- We're out here!

38:05.449 --> 38:08.077
Come on, boy,
get over here!

38:08.119 --> 38:10.610
- What is that?
- Get the lead out of your ass!

38:10.655 --> 38:13.522
Come on, big guy!

38:13.557 --> 38:15.218
What is that?

38:19.630 --> 38:21.154
Go ahead, get her
on out of there.

38:41.385 --> 38:42.647
Come on, private!

38:57.835 --> 38:59.700
Oh my God.

38:59.737 --> 39:01.329
I'm gonna get
us out of here, okay?

39:04.241 --> 39:06.505
Dean! Stay with me!

39:06.544 --> 39:08.603
I need you
to be a soldier.

39:08.646 --> 39:12.639
People are gonna come
looking for 'em, I know it.

39:12.683 --> 39:14.810
You have made
a big mistake!

39:14.852 --> 39:17.150
Boy, are you dumb.

39:17.188 --> 39:19.520
Nobody's gonna miss those
creatures, not one person.

39:19.690 --> 39:22.124
Not now,
not when they gone.

39:52.823 --> 39:57.283
Let's see.
Anything in here?

39:57.328 --> 40:00.297
A bunch of shit.

40:24.688 --> 40:27.486
Oh...

40:27.525 --> 40:31.359
You little bastard,
I know you've got more in there.

40:52.683 --> 40:56.016
Come on, Tommy, ain't no different
than the slaughterhouse.

40:56.053 --> 41:00.183
Meat's meat, bones bones.

41:00.224 --> 41:02.021
Get it done.

41:07.231 --> 41:10.257
My daddy always told me

41:10.301 --> 41:14.260
that if you want to be a good farmer
you gotta keep your livestock clean.

41:18.108 --> 41:20.702
Clean goat
is a happy goat.

41:20.744 --> 41:23.178
What the hell do you
want from us, man?

41:23.214 --> 41:25.205
Are you happy yet?

41:50.674 --> 41:52.642
Hey!

41:58.182 --> 42:01.208
H... hey, help us.
Help us down, please.

42:05.456 --> 42:08.948
I don't get involved
in his affairs. No.

42:33.851 --> 42:35.842
Please, help me.

42:38.489 --> 42:41.083
Please, please.

43:02.413 --> 43:05.644
No! No!

43:05.683 --> 43:08.151
Help me! No!

43:08.185 --> 43:10.710
No!

43:12.690 --> 43:15.682
- No!
- Bailey.

43:19.263 --> 43:22.426
- I didn't know.
- Didn't know what?

43:24.168 --> 43:26.159
I didn't know you were
going back there for me.

43:26.270 --> 43:29.296
Let's figure out how
to get out of here, Dean.

43:31.542 --> 43:34.602
By God, I'm gonna make
a soldier out of you yet!

43:36.880 --> 43:40.372
No! Please, please!

43:40.417 --> 43:42.977
Are you ashamed
of your country, Dean?

43:43.020 --> 43:45.716
No, please! No!

43:48.726 --> 43:50.591
What do you think,
soldier?

43:50.628 --> 43:54.792
What would be the proper
punishment for treason?

43:54.832 --> 43:57.426
Just please
let him go, sir. No!

43:59.203 --> 44:03.037
I can't make out a word you're saying,
you know it, asshole?

44:03.073 --> 44:05.200
You're killing him, sir!
Please!

44:05.242 --> 44:08.541
No no no!
Please, sir!

44:09.813 --> 44:13.977
Ain't nothing I hate worse
than a draft-dodging hippie protester.

44:14.018 --> 44:15.451
I'm Dean!

44:15.486 --> 44:17.215
It was my draft card!

44:17.254 --> 44:19.279
It was my draft card!
It was my draft card!

44:19.323 --> 44:22.383
And you'd just stand
here and let him die.

44:22.426 --> 44:25.418
Sir, could you let
him breathe, please?

44:25.462 --> 44:27.953
Please, can you
let him breathe?

44:27.998 --> 44:30.193
- My apologies.
- Eric!

44:33.370 --> 44:36.430
Oh shit!

44:36.473 --> 44:40.500
Well, so now you want to play
soldier. Is that it?

44:49.687 --> 44:51.621
Your brother
saved your life.

44:51.655 --> 44:55.591
I'm gonna fucking
cut your head off.

44:55.626 --> 44:59.221
Yeah, you just keep
sweet-talking me, dumpling.

45:16.113 --> 45:19.412
Help me!

45:27.157 --> 45:31.355
Back in 1952, Korean War,

45:31.395 --> 45:33.955
yours truly was a P.O.W.

45:33.997 --> 45:36.124
That's "prisoner of war"
for you,

45:36.166 --> 45:37.929
and I know what in the hell
I'm talking about.

45:37.968 --> 45:40.459
Used to be
Sergeant Major Hoyt.

45:40.504 --> 45:43.735
Back in those days
there wasn't no rules.

45:43.774 --> 45:46.675
No regulations like
there are today.

45:46.710 --> 45:50.612
You got captured,
you had two choices:

45:50.647 --> 45:54.208
You starve to death
or survive.

45:57.588 --> 46:01.991
Now, you had to eat.
Rations were scarce.

46:02.025 --> 46:06.052
So, well,
about once a week

46:06.096 --> 46:09.725
some poor soul was chosen.

46:11.301 --> 46:13.292
Chosen?

46:13.337 --> 46:17.637
You fucking idiot!
I just told you we had to eat!

46:17.674 --> 46:21.041
Ain't you listening
to me? Huh?

46:21.078 --> 46:24.980
I'd say that's the ultimate sacrifice
for your country, wouldn't you?

46:28.051 --> 46:31.145
Why are you doing this?

46:31.188 --> 46:34.089
Got to get
you cleaned up.

46:35.292 --> 46:37.123
We're gonna have company.

46:37.161 --> 46:40.562
You don't want to look
dirty for company, do you?

46:40.597 --> 46:42.189
Huh?

46:42.232 --> 46:47.135
This is your lucky day!

46:47.171 --> 46:51.232
Now what happens if you kids
drive all the way up to Austin

46:51.275 --> 46:55.712
just to find out that you don't even
qualify to be in the army?

46:55.746 --> 46:59.944
I'm concerned about
your physical fitness here!

46:59.983 --> 47:04.920
Now, doesn't that
make you feel special?

47:04.955 --> 47:07.082
Huh? Don't it?

47:07.124 --> 47:08.921
Please.

47:08.959 --> 47:12.486
That would be,
"Please, Sheriff."

47:12.529 --> 47:15.555
- You got it?
- Please, Sheriff.

47:15.599 --> 47:18.329
Hey, boy, there you go.
I knew you could do that.

47:18.368 --> 47:20.393
That wasn't so hard,
was it?

47:20.437 --> 47:24.271
How would you like to just
stand right up here today

47:24.308 --> 47:27.072
and just walk
right on out of here, huh?

47:27.110 --> 47:29.738
I'd like that, Sheriff.

47:29.780 --> 47:34.274
Yeah, well, freedom ain't free.
You know that, right?

47:34.318 --> 47:37.947
What you gonna
do is 20 push-ups.

47:37.988 --> 47:41.185
20 push-ups stand
between you and freedom.

47:41.225 --> 47:45.423
This shit is what heroes
are made of, you know?

47:45.462 --> 47:48.295
Well, come on,
I'm waiting!

47:48.332 --> 47:50.357
Let's get with
the program, sunshine!

47:50.400 --> 47:52.800
Come on, you can do it!
Get those push-ups now!

47:52.836 --> 47:54.428
No!

47:54.471 --> 47:57.599
Shh, now don't cry.

47:57.641 --> 47:58.835
Don't cry.

48:03.113 --> 48:04.978
No.

48:05.015 --> 48:06.243
No!

48:06.283 --> 48:09.684
You shut your cocksucker,
you son of a bitch!

48:11.355 --> 48:13.482
One!

48:13.523 --> 48:17.050
Whoa, that was a really
fine push-up there. One...

48:19.463 --> 48:21.294
Two...

48:21.331 --> 48:25.495
We've got ourselves a regular
American hero here, ain't we?

48:25.535 --> 48:26.661
Three.

48:26.703 --> 48:28.432
Come on, sweetheart.

48:28.472 --> 48:32.169
# Hush, little baby #

48:32.209 --> 48:34.609
# Don't say a word... #

48:36.613 --> 48:38.080
Ow!

48:38.115 --> 48:42.677
# Mama's gonna buy
you a mockingbird... #

48:42.719 --> 48:45.244
Eight.

48:48.392 --> 48:49.950
What's it gonna be?

48:49.993 --> 48:52.757
You're gonna be
the motherfucker who eats?

48:52.796 --> 48:56.323
Or are you gonna be
the poor sorry motherfucker

48:56.366 --> 48:57.594
who gets ate?

48:57.634 --> 49:02.003
# If that mockingbird
don't sing... #

49:04.241 --> 49:08.871
# Mama's gonna buy you
a golden ring... #

49:08.912 --> 49:11.710
Don't give up, Dean!
Show this motherfucker!

49:11.748 --> 49:13.773
Show me that you
ain't as fucked up

49:13.817 --> 49:16.342
as the rest of your
useless goddamn generation.

49:16.386 --> 49:17.785
Eighteen!

49:17.821 --> 49:20.119
# If that golden... #

49:20.157 --> 49:22.887
- Come on!
- Nine...

49:22.926 --> 49:26.362
# ... Is gonna buy you
a looking glass... #

49:26.396 --> 49:27.488
Go!

49:31.034 --> 49:34.003
That's only half of one.
That don't count, boy!

49:35.739 --> 49:37.400
Don't give up, Dean!

49:42.913 --> 49:44.244
- 20.
- Yeah!

49:45.582 --> 49:46.708
Don't cry.

49:47.718 --> 49:48.912
No!

49:48.952 --> 49:53.252
- No.
- I never had me a little girl.

49:55.058 --> 49:57.322
Got more guts than
I thought you had, boy.

49:57.361 --> 50:00.728
I'm a man of my word.
You're free to go.

50:02.466 --> 50:05.162
I'm gonna
fucking kill you!

50:05.202 --> 50:08.535
My money says
he ain't going nowhere.

50:26.990 --> 50:28.924
Stop!

50:28.959 --> 50:32.190
Please, stop!

50:32.229 --> 50:34.789
Stop!

50:34.931 --> 50:37.195
Please stop!

50:41.004 --> 50:43.472
Look... my friends, they...

50:43.507 --> 50:46.476
they have my friends, okay? They're in a
house over there through the woods. I...

50:47.878 --> 50:52.281
Look, they have your friend.
They took your friend.

50:53.383 --> 50:54.577
I saw you both
at the store.

50:54.618 --> 50:58.281
He shot her.
The sheriff shot her.

51:05.729 --> 51:07.458
Show me where.

51:16.440 --> 51:20.069
Weather has been
so hot lately.

51:20.110 --> 51:23.511
It's important to drink
your liquids, you know?

51:23.547 --> 51:27.176
The body needs
to hydrate.

51:29.052 --> 51:33.682
I got me some of that breakfast tea...
that's what they call it...

51:33.723 --> 51:36.385
and I fixed me up
a batch of that

51:36.426 --> 51:40.829
and I had it over a big fruit jar of ice
with plenty of sugar.

51:40.864 --> 51:45.358
And I had that
breakfast tea for dinner.

51:45.402 --> 51:48.428
Tastes like paradise.

51:48.472 --> 51:50.269
Not a bit
of difference.

51:50.307 --> 51:53.242
Iced tea.

51:53.276 --> 51:56.211
Yeah, iced tea.

51:56.246 --> 51:58.407
You know
what else is good?

51:58.448 --> 52:01.474
- Iced coffee.
- Oh.

52:01.518 --> 52:05.955
Delicious.
With them little cinnamon sprinkles.

52:13.663 --> 52:15.824
Dean. Dean!

52:46.296 --> 52:49.595
Dean, you did good.
But we gotta hide, okay?

52:50.800 --> 52:54.463
Come on!
Come on!

53:00.577 --> 53:02.977
Do you have any idea where
the hell we're going?

53:03.013 --> 53:05.140
Yes, it's...

53:05.182 --> 53:07.514
it's here somewhere.

53:09.886 --> 53:11.751
Sometimes...

53:11.788 --> 53:15.019
I just can't stop eating
them little chocolates.

53:15.058 --> 53:18.118
They're so good.

53:18.161 --> 53:19.685
I put coconut in them.

53:19.729 --> 53:22.129
Oh, sweet Jesus.

53:25.769 --> 53:27.794
Hoyt! Hoyt!

53:27.837 --> 53:30.897
Come here! Hoyt!

53:30.941 --> 53:32.738
Hoyt! Hoyt!

53:34.444 --> 53:36.674
Eric!

53:36.713 --> 53:40.205
- He's in here!
- Eric! Get me out of here!

53:43.386 --> 53:45.980
- Shut your mouth!
- Oh, my!

53:46.022 --> 53:48.388
He's here! He's here!
He's here!

53:48.425 --> 53:50.325
Help! Help!

53:50.360 --> 53:53.158
There's keys over
there on the counter.

53:56.600 --> 53:59.398
Damn you!
A man's home is his fucking castle!

53:59.436 --> 54:02.735
- What the fuck are you doing in here?
- Oh no!

54:05.175 --> 54:06.608
Hey!

54:10.580 --> 54:12.548
Find the truck. Go!
I'll get Dean! I'll get Dean!

54:12.582 --> 54:14.880
Unlock the door!

54:17.721 --> 54:22.784
Thomas, Thomas, get up here!
I need you!

54:45.181 --> 54:47.809
Come on, Dean, come on.

54:51.888 --> 54:54.721
Hey! Get back here,
you skinny bitch!

55:17.914 --> 55:19.279
No!

55:19.316 --> 55:23.013
Come on, we're gonna
get out of here.

55:24.854 --> 55:27.584
Dean, go! Go!
Come on!

55:27.624 --> 55:29.683
Shoot me, you asshole!

55:29.726 --> 55:33.924
You're not a soldier!
You hold that gun like a fucking girl!

55:33.963 --> 55:35.225
Get out of my way.

55:35.265 --> 55:37.233
You're not a candy-ass,
are you, Sheriff?

55:37.267 --> 55:40.168
Pull the fucking trigger!

55:41.371 --> 55:43.532
I ain't finished
with you yet.

55:47.444 --> 55:52.040
Well... let's just go see
if we caught anything.

56:07.197 --> 56:08.687
Well well well...

56:08.732 --> 56:11.599
it's a good thing
you didn't go to Vietnam.

56:11.634 --> 56:16.435
Something like
this might've happened.

56:30.720 --> 56:33.382
You don't like playing with me
anymore because I'm a pussy.

56:33.423 --> 56:34.890
That's what you said.

56:34.924 --> 56:37.358
Well, my nephew Tommy
ain't no pussy.

56:37.394 --> 56:39.726
Maybe you want to play
with him for a little while.

57:07.457 --> 57:08.754
That's it.

57:12.462 --> 57:13.759
Okay, so what
are we gonna do?

57:13.797 --> 57:15.890
We? I'm gonna get
my girlfriend.

57:15.932 --> 57:18.526
No no, look.
What about my friends?

57:18.568 --> 57:21.332
- What?
- My friends.

57:21.371 --> 57:23.236
Fuck your friends.

57:23.273 --> 57:25.571
You're on your own.

57:25.608 --> 57:27.667
You asshole!

57:46.329 --> 57:47.318
Shit.

58:27.837 --> 58:32.137
Dean, Dean. Oh fuck. Thank God.

58:33.243 --> 58:34.608
What happened?

58:34.644 --> 58:37.112
- Chrissie. Oh, thank God.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

58:37.146 --> 58:39.671
- No no no. Don't!
- I'm sorry.

58:39.716 --> 58:42.378
Just stay still.
Okay, are you okay? You're okay.

58:42.418 --> 58:44.352
They're psycho.

58:44.387 --> 58:46.787
Come on, where's Eric
and Bailey? Come on.

58:46.823 --> 58:50.224
In the house.

58:50.260 --> 58:52.490
You need to go
get help, Chrissie.

58:52.529 --> 58:53.518
Okay?

58:53.563 --> 58:56.157
There's no help to go for.

58:58.568 --> 59:02.732
I have to go in there. You're gonna stay
here. I'm gonna come get you, okay?

59:02.772 --> 59:04.637
Okay.

59:06.643 --> 59:09.203
Don't you think you're
gonna go anyplace, huh?

59:19.522 --> 59:21.547
I love you.

59:56.993 --> 59:59.985
No! Come on! You don't... you don't
have to do this, man, please.

01:00:00.029 --> 01:00:03.055
No! No. No!

01:00:04.467 --> 01:00:06.196
No!

01:00:08.104 --> 01:00:10.197
You don't have
to do this.

01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:13.602
You son of a bitch!

01:00:18.181 --> 01:00:19.808
Fuck you!

01:00:21.651 --> 01:00:23.881
Fucker.

01:01:41.064 --> 01:01:43.089
Huh?

01:02:53.903 --> 01:02:55.427
What the fuck...

01:02:56.639 --> 01:02:59.403
Oh shit!

01:02:59.442 --> 01:03:03.378
- Uh, he shot me! Uh!
- Shut up! Shut up!

01:03:03.412 --> 01:03:05.471
Where's the girl?

01:03:05.515 --> 01:03:07.483
I'm gonna blow your head off.
Tell me where the girl is.

01:03:09.118 --> 01:03:12.451
I'm shot! Shit!

01:03:12.488 --> 01:03:16.015
How many times I gotta tell you
not to play with guns?

01:03:16.058 --> 01:03:18.925
Oh, Jesus, oh...

01:03:18.961 --> 01:03:20.553
Now look what you've
done to yourself.

01:03:20.596 --> 01:03:24.123
- I didn't do it.
- Stop your damn whining, Uncle Monty.

01:03:24.167 --> 01:03:26.260
Mama, get some
towels in here.

01:03:26.302 --> 01:03:28.293
Uncle Monty made a mess.

01:03:28.337 --> 01:03:29.861
Sheriff.

01:03:29.906 --> 01:03:31.703
Who in the hell are you?

01:03:31.741 --> 01:03:34.175
- What do you want, boy?
- I want my girl.

01:03:35.378 --> 01:03:38.211
Take me to her
or I'm gonna blow your head off.

01:03:38.247 --> 01:03:39.839
Okay, all right.

01:03:41.284 --> 01:03:43.616
- Where is she?
- Thomas!

01:03:43.653 --> 01:03:46.986
Hey! Do not fuck around.
Where is the girl?

01:03:47.023 --> 01:03:49.548
Come on.

01:04:04.507 --> 01:04:06.839
Help me!

01:04:08.311 --> 01:04:10.279
Thomas!

01:04:16.052 --> 01:04:17.212
Thomas!

01:04:17.253 --> 01:04:19.050
Thomas, where're you at?

01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:10.471
Eric, are you okay?

01:05:10.506 --> 01:05:12.974
What are you doing here?
You gotta get out of here.

01:05:13.009 --> 01:05:16.274
- You're... you're gonna be okay.
- How bad is it? Tell me.

01:05:19.649 --> 01:05:21.913
- No! No!
- It's all right. I can't feel it.

01:05:21.951 --> 01:05:24.579
- I'm gonna get you... it's okay.
- Did he cut it off?

01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:26.247
- It's okay.
- I can't feel it.

01:05:26.289 --> 01:05:27.654
No! No!

01:05:33.195 --> 01:05:35.629
I'm cold.

01:05:35.665 --> 01:05:39.829
How... how many?

01:05:39.869 --> 01:05:43.669
- Three.
- Boys or girls?

01:05:43.706 --> 01:05:46.800
All boys.

01:05:46.842 --> 01:05:47.934
What are their names?

01:05:47.977 --> 01:05:52.971
Paul and Christopher...

01:05:53.015 --> 01:05:54.277
and Eric.

01:05:54.317 --> 01:05:56.478
Okay. Okay.
It's gonna be okay.

01:05:56.519 --> 01:05:59.147
I promise.
I promise, okay?

01:06:00.289 --> 01:06:03.190
Take it easy.
There she is.

01:06:04.994 --> 01:06:06.291
Help me.

01:06:06.329 --> 01:06:08.695
That's not her.

01:06:08.731 --> 01:06:11.165
Shit, that ain't her.

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:14.135
You don't want
to see the other girl.

01:06:14.170 --> 01:06:15.569
Just shoot him!

01:06:15.604 --> 01:06:18.471
You dumb son of a bitch.

01:06:23.045 --> 01:06:25.707
Get him, Tommy, come on!

01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:35.953
Damn it! Come on, Tommy.

01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:37.289
This is one
of those assholes

01:06:37.326 --> 01:06:39.658
who used to fuck with you
in the schoolyard, Tommy.

01:06:39.695 --> 01:06:43.859
Come on, Tommy, get over here!
Get that thing going!

01:06:43.899 --> 01:06:45.867
Let's go, Tommy!
Come on!

01:06:50.573 --> 01:06:53.406
Crank it up!
Let's go!

01:06:53.442 --> 01:06:55.307
What it is, asshole!

01:06:55.344 --> 01:06:56.902
Yeah!

01:07:21.437 --> 01:07:23.769
You beautiful bastard, you!

01:07:27.877 --> 01:07:29.936
You fucking asshole!

01:07:29.979 --> 01:07:33.915
You son of a bitch!
Comin' in my fucking house...

01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:46.285
Oh, God.

01:07:46.328 --> 01:07:47.852
You have to
get out of here.

01:07:47.897 --> 01:07:50.593
- No no no!
- Get out of here.

01:07:50.633 --> 01:07:53.295
- No!
- Yes, Chrissie, please.

01:07:55.738 --> 01:07:57.729
Hide!

01:08:42.184 --> 01:08:45.118
What are you doing?

01:08:45.154 --> 01:08:48.089
Don't. No.
What are you...

01:08:54.029 --> 01:08:56.292
No!

01:11:18.874 --> 01:11:22.810
Thomas! Tommy.

01:11:22.845 --> 01:11:26.337
Thomas, quit playing with your
fucking dolls and get up here!

01:11:32.021 --> 01:11:35.787
I'm glad you brought
your little buddy.

01:11:35.824 --> 01:11:38.987
Hmm, I like
your new face.

01:11:40.296 --> 01:11:41.422
Come on, Tommy,
get up here.

01:12:56.338 --> 01:12:59.967
Please! Please!

01:13:00.008 --> 01:13:05.407
Help!

01:13:32.207 --> 01:13:36.769
Please, please, somebody help!

01:13:36.812 --> 01:13:40.304
Now this will take your
fever down, all right?

01:13:42.418 --> 01:13:44.147
See what you've done?

01:13:44.186 --> 01:13:48.987
You killed that sheriff
and you started up a whole whirlwind.

01:13:49.024 --> 01:13:51.959
Mama, please stop
your damn bellyaching.

01:13:53.962 --> 01:13:57.159
Uncle Monty,
I love you.

01:13:57.199 --> 01:14:00.396
You know that, and I always do
what's right by you, don't I?

01:14:00.436 --> 01:14:01.926
And you trust me,
don't you?

01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:04.336
Yeah, I trust you.
Just do something.

01:14:04.373 --> 01:14:06.307
Take care of you.

01:14:06.341 --> 01:14:08.172
Get in here, boy!

01:14:08.210 --> 01:14:10.303
- Uh! Ow!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

01:14:10.345 --> 01:14:12.313
Tommy!

01:14:14.817 --> 01:14:17.980
- Now, this ain't gonna hurt...
- Huh?

01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:19.783
...much.

01:14:21.857 --> 01:14:23.347
What's that on your face?

01:14:23.392 --> 01:14:25.485
Mama, you get over there
and hold Uncle Monty.

01:14:25.527 --> 01:14:28.553
- Why?
- 'Cause he ain't gonna like this much,

01:14:28.597 --> 01:14:30.258
that's why.

01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:32.494
- No!
- What the fuck is this?

01:14:32.534 --> 01:14:34.161
Surgery.
Come on, Tommy.

01:14:34.203 --> 01:14:37.195
- No!
- Oh my God!

01:14:42.010 --> 01:14:44.945
Oh, bullshit.
Look at that!

01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:47.107
Now, Tommy,
that's goddamn sloppy.

01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:49.379
That'll get infected.
Even him up. Come on.

01:14:49.418 --> 01:14:52.182
- Huh?
- What?

01:14:52.221 --> 01:14:55.418
- Sheriff, no, stop!
- No!

01:15:06.401 --> 01:15:08.335
There you go.
Nice work, Tommy.

01:15:08.370 --> 01:15:10.463
What did
you do that for?

01:15:11.573 --> 01:15:13.473
Balance.

01:15:17.145 --> 01:15:19.613
I'll get Tommy
to wrap this up.

01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:29.349
Please, somebody help.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.833
Okay. Shh.

01:16:47.869 --> 01:16:49.666
You're gonna
be okay, okay?

01:16:49.705 --> 01:16:51.570
Shh shh, I'm sorry.

01:16:54.543 --> 01:16:57.706
It's okay. You're safe.

01:16:57.746 --> 01:17:00.647
They know you're here.

01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:07.687
I'll have Mama throw on
another plate for supper.

01:17:07.723 --> 01:17:10.783
You... you can stay?

01:17:21.436 --> 01:17:24.837
I think we need a little more
garlic in this one.

01:17:24.873 --> 01:17:27.933
Mama, a little more
garlic in this one.

01:17:32.381 --> 01:17:35.009
I'll go set the table.

01:17:36.952 --> 01:17:38.886
Oh, shit!

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:42.151
It's okay, Mama.
Just wash it off. It'll be fine.

01:17:42.190 --> 01:17:44.090
Don't step on the fingers.

01:17:44.126 --> 01:17:48.119
What the hell are they
doing on the floor, anyway?

01:17:48.163 --> 01:17:51.929
Good thing you keep
a clean house.

01:17:51.967 --> 01:17:53.935
I wonder whose tongue this is.

01:17:53.969 --> 01:17:57.200
That's that fuckin' biker.

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:09.876
# Hush little baby, don't say a word #

01:18:09.918 --> 01:18:13.376
# Mama's gonna buy you #

01:18:13.422 --> 01:18:16.914
# A mockingbird #

01:18:16.958 --> 01:18:21.486
# If that mockingbird
don't sing #

01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:25.432
# Mama's gonna buy you #

01:18:25.467 --> 01:18:27.230
# A golden ring... #

01:18:29.304 --> 01:18:33.968
# If that golden
ring turns brass #

01:18:39.848 --> 01:18:44.808
# Mama's gonna buy
you a looking glass... #

01:18:49.491 --> 01:18:53.188
Why are you doing this?

01:18:53.228 --> 01:18:57.756
No talking until after
I've said grace, asshole.

01:19:09.711 --> 01:19:12.179
Now...

01:19:12.214 --> 01:19:16.548
let's give thanks
for the bounty that's been given us.

01:19:16.585 --> 01:19:19.486
Bow your heads.

01:19:20.989 --> 01:19:23.423
I was hungry
and He gave me meat.

01:19:23.458 --> 01:19:25.926
I was thirsty
and He gave me drink.

01:19:25.961 --> 01:19:29.328
I was a stranger
and He took me in.

01:19:31.032 --> 01:19:35.162
This family has endured
through adversity and pain.

01:19:35.203 --> 01:19:39.105
- We have endured.
- Dean.

01:19:39.141 --> 01:19:41.507
We have prevailed.

01:19:41.543 --> 01:19:44.273
We will never ever
go hungry again.

01:19:46.648 --> 01:19:48.115
Amen.

01:19:50.552 --> 01:19:52.486
I have
a question for you.

01:19:56.024 --> 01:19:57.958
One that involves
the family tree, the...

01:19:57.993 --> 01:20:01.190
lineage, if you will,

01:20:01.229 --> 01:20:03.493
So I guess this
one's for the table.

01:20:05.066 --> 01:20:07.000
You guys fuck
all your cousins

01:20:07.035 --> 01:20:08.525
or just the ones
you find attractive?

01:20:12.073 --> 01:20:13.563
You blasphemous bitch!

01:20:13.608 --> 01:20:18.045
This is redemption, lady!
That's what this is!

01:20:18.079 --> 01:20:21.048
Oh, you're all gonna pay
for your sins. That's right!

01:20:21.082 --> 01:20:23.050
And especially you!

01:20:23.084 --> 01:20:27.077
Mama... go take care
of Uncle Monty.

01:20:32.060 --> 01:20:33.550
You know what, Mama?

01:20:33.595 --> 01:20:35.893
I don't think this
one likes your cooking.

01:20:35.931 --> 01:20:38.525
But who gives a shit?

01:20:38.567 --> 01:20:41.502
She's gonna be sucking
her soup through a straw

01:20:41.536 --> 01:20:43.936
for some time
to come now, ain't she?

01:20:43.972 --> 01:20:47.169
Come on, Monty,
take a sip.

01:20:47.209 --> 01:20:51.145
You gotta have something
to build up your strength.

01:20:53.515 --> 01:20:55.073
Please do it.

01:20:55.116 --> 01:20:58.711
Just do whatever you're gonna do,
you bunch of degenerates!

01:20:58.753 --> 01:21:02.314
I will not have you
speak ill of this family.

01:21:10.098 --> 01:21:11.793
Come on, now,
open your mouth.

01:21:14.169 --> 01:21:17.627
No. No. No.

01:21:33.255 --> 01:21:34.779
Set her free, child.

01:21:37.826 --> 01:21:40.954
No! No!

01:21:42.330 --> 01:21:45.629
No! No! No! No!

01:21:45.667 --> 01:21:47.931
No! No!

01:21:50.472 --> 01:21:52.770
Take that one downstairs!

01:21:52.807 --> 01:21:55.332
No, you stay away from me,
you fucking animal!

01:21:55.377 --> 01:21:57.902
You get the fuck
away from me! No!

01:21:57.946 --> 01:21:59.811
Get your hands off me!

01:21:59.848 --> 01:22:01.816
You dirty animal!

01:22:01.850 --> 01:22:04.250
No! Dean! Dean!

01:22:04.286 --> 01:22:07.346
Can't you see?
Your friend ain't with us no more.

01:22:07.389 --> 01:22:11.223
No! No! No!

01:22:15.563 --> 01:22:19.499
Here we go.

01:22:19.534 --> 01:22:23.026
Dean! Help! No!

01:22:23.071 --> 01:22:25.369
No!

01:22:36.952 --> 01:22:38.214
Hey!

01:22:39.287 --> 01:22:41.221
Where in the hell
you going, bitch?

01:22:49.597 --> 01:22:51.827
She's gonna tell them all
what we done.

01:23:06.881 --> 01:23:10.078
There comes a time when
every boy becomes a man.

01:23:38.079 --> 01:23:41.071
You motherfucker!

01:23:41.116 --> 01:23:44.313
Now we'll see what kind of soldier
you are, Sheriff.

01:23:47.222 --> 01:23:48.849
One!

01:23:48.890 --> 01:23:52.223
That was beautiful
form, Sheriff!

01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:55.457
Two! Halfway doesn't
count, dickhead!

01:23:55.497 --> 01:23:59.558
Three! Is that all you got?
Is that all you fucking got?

01:23:59.601 --> 01:24:01.899
Fucker! You killed
my girlfriend!

01:24:01.936 --> 01:24:03.767
You fucking asshole!

01:24:03.805 --> 01:24:05.636
Fuck you!

01:24:09.377 --> 01:24:11.538
My money says
you're not going anywhere.

01:25:13.675 --> 01:25:15.540
Fuck.

01:26:37.859 --> 01:26:39.156
Fuck.

01:27:09.123 --> 01:27:11.114
Chrissie!

01:30:30.057 --> 01:30:32.787
From 1969 to 1973

01:30:32.827 --> 01:30:36.888
the Hewitt family murdered
33 people across the state of Texas.

01:30:36.931 --> 01:30:41.027
To this day their killing spree
is universally considered

01:30:41.068 --> 01:30:44.697
one of the most notorious
and perversely sadistic crimes

01:30:44.739 --> 01:30:47.367
in the annals
of American history:

01:30:47.408 --> 01:30:49.774
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
