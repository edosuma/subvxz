We built the awesome-est

00:55.189 --> 00:59.858
Just need a pile of wood to keep
the pies cooking all winter.

00:59.860 --> 01:02.161
Is this enough wood, Jake?

01:02.163 --> 01:03.562
Ha! It's a start.

01:03.564 --> 01:04.963
But if we're going to be
cooking pizza

01:04.965 --> 01:07.299
for all the boarders
and skaters this winter,

01:07.301 --> 01:10.269
we need a huge-mongous pile!

01:22.783 --> 01:24.116
What kind of pizza toppings

01:24.118 --> 01:26.418
should we bring to
the pizza party, Rubble?

01:26.420 --> 01:30.589
An important question like that
needs the help of an expert.

01:30.591 --> 01:34.226

Liver bites?

01:34.228 --> 01:35.461

Hey, can I help
choose pizza toppings?

01:46.440 --> 01:47.706
Whoa!

01:47.708 --> 01:48.974
Look out!

01:48.976 --> 01:50.542
How does he do that?

01:50.544 --> 01:55.747
Mmm, we should definitely
bring pepperoni chews.

01:55.749 --> 01:58.550
Can I get a paw here, Rocky?

02:11.832 --> 02:14.333
We need to deliver
my handmade pizza dough

02:14.335 --> 02:16.335

Ooh!

02:22.209 --> 02:26.512
Sorry, Grandpa! You okay?

02:26.514 --> 02:30.115
Yeah, luckily,
I had a nice doughy landing.

02:30.117 --> 02:34.119
Hey, we can make Grandpa-faced
pizza at the party.

02:34.121 --> 02:37.222
I think the pups
might prefer pepperoni.

02:37.224 --> 02:38.690
Come on, let's go.

02:38.692 --> 02:40.425

02:52.072 --> 02:55.140

Are you okay, Alex?

02:56.410 --> 02:58.744
I'm fine, Grandpa.

02:58.746 --> 03:01.914
Uh-oh, Alex,
we're hanging over the edge.

03:01.916 --> 03:06.385
If we get out, the van could
slide right down the cliff.

03:06.387 --> 03:09.288
We need the PAW Patrol!

Grandpa-faced pizza!

Over the teeth and past
the gums, look out, tummy,

11:39.199 --> 11:42.600
'cause here it comes!

11:42.602 --> 11:46.104
(Laughing)

11:51.611 --> 11:55.313
Hey, Skye.
I can't wait to see you.

11:55.315 --> 11:57.749
SKYE:
<i>Cool!</i>

11:57.751 --> 12:00.118
<i>Have you worked up</i>
<i> some new tricks?</i>

12:00.120 --> 12:01.820
Oh, yeah, I'll show you
when I get to Jake's,

12:01.822 --> 12:05.190
as long as this storm doesn't
ground me before I get there.

12:05.192 --> 12:06.524
<i>Be careful.</i>

12:06.526 --> 12:08.093
See you up on the mountain!

12:08.095 --> 12:10.428

12:10.430 --> 12:14.432
Okay, whichever team
pulls the red ribbon

12:14.434 --> 12:17.736
over the marked line wins.

12:17.738 --> 12:19.637
(Grunting)

12:19.639 --> 12:24.342
Hey, Skye, want to play
tug of war with us?

12:24.344 --> 12:26.144
Yeah, come be on
our winning team.

12:26.146 --> 12:29.781
Sorry, pups,
I'm going to Jake's mountain.

12:29.783 --> 12:30.849
(Barking)

12:30.851 --> 12:33.518
Wings!

12:33.520 --> 12:35.587
This pup's got to fly!

12:35.589 --> 12:37.188
Bye, Skye!
See you!

12:37.190 --> 12:39.090
Bye!

12:41.661 --> 12:45.864
Ready, set, go!

12:48.201 --> 12:50.635
ALL:
Whoa!

12:50.637 --> 12:51.436
Uh-oh.

12:51.438 --> 12:54.139
Did I forget to call
a snowflake break?

12:54.141 --> 12:55.774
(Laughing)

12:55.776 --> 12:58.777
A little windy!

12:58.779 --> 13:01.646
Whoa, a lot windy!

13:01.648 --> 13:03.515
(Grunting)

13:05.285 --> 13:09.420
My pup tag, oh, no! Whoa! Whoa!

(Grunting)

13:12.359 --> 13:14.793
(Groaning)

13:14.795 --> 13:17.762
Uh-oh, that wing
is too bent to fly.

13:17.764 --> 13:20.064
And my paw kind of hurts.

13:20.066 --> 13:23.368
And I need my pup tag
to call Ryder.

13:23.370 --> 13:26.971
It could be anywhere.

13:27.841 --> 13:30.542
Looks like I'll have to hike
up to Jake's.

13:30.544 --> 13:35.980

the fun day I was planning.

13:37.584 --> 13:38.583

13:38.585 --> 13:40.018
There's Ace.

13:40.020 --> 13:43.721
But where's Skye?
She should be here by now.

13:43.723 --> 13:47.392
Skye, are you almost here? Skye?

13:47.394 --> 13:52.030
<i> Hello? Skye? Can you hear me?</i>

13:52.032 --> 13:53.231
Hey, Everest. What's up?

13:53.233 --> 13:55.366
Skye didn't answer
when I called.

13:55.368 --> 13:58.803
I'm afraid something happened
in the storm.

13:58.805 --> 14:00.705
Uh-oh, we better call Ryder.

14:00.707 --> 14:02.140
(Phone ringing)

14:02.142 --> 14:04.542
Hello, Ryder here.

14:04.544 --> 14:05.944
<i> Hey, Ryder.</i>
<i> Skye's not here yet.</i>

14:05.946 --> 14:07.478
<i> Everest and I</i>
<i> are getting worried.</i>

14:07.480 --> 14:09.314
<i>She didn't answer</i>
<i>when I called her.</i>

14:09.316 --> 14:10.748
That is strange!

14:10.750 --> 14:11.883
Don't worry. We'll find her.

14:11.885 --> 14:15.453
No job is too big.
No pup is too small.

14:15.455 --> 14:17.555
<i> Over and out.</i>

14:17.557 --> 14:19.924

Whoa!

14:21.328 --> 14:22.460
Needs us.
Needs us.

14:22.462 --> 14:25.463
Whoa, oh, oh, oh!

14:25.465 --> 14:28.266
Whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa!

15:04.437 --> 15:06.471
Ryder, we need to call someone!

15:06.473 --> 15:08.740
He did: us.

15:08.742 --> 15:10.942
(Laughing)

15:10.944 --> 15:13.678
Pups, Skye was flying
up to Jake's mountain,

15:13.680 --> 15:16.915
but we haven't heard from her
since the sudden snowstorm.

15:16.917 --> 15:18.316
Poor Skye!

15:18.318 --> 15:19.284
Don't worry.

15:19.286 --> 15:20.551
We'll find her
before it gets dark.

15:20.553 --> 15:23.187
First, I need Everest.

15:23.189 --> 15:24.222
<i>Here, Ryder.</i>

15:24.224 --> 15:26.925
I need you and your snow cat
to head down the mountain,

15:26.927 --> 15:28.192
in search for Skye.

15:28.194 --> 15:31.896
Ice or snow, I'm ready to go.

15:31.898 --> 15:32.897
And Ace, can you help?

15:32.899 --> 15:35.366
It might be easier
to find her from above.

15:35.368 --> 15:37.669
<i>You got it, Ryder.</i>

15:37.671 --> 15:39.637
I'll also need--

15:39.639 --> 15:41.172
Pick me! Pick me!

15:41.174 --> 15:42.774
Spy Chase.

15:42.776 --> 15:43.908
Yes!

15:43.910 --> 15:46.544
I need you to sniff out
Skye's trail.

15:46.546 --> 15:48.846

That's why we've got to
find Skye quickly.

We may never find her
in the dark.

maybe Skye can find the drone.

19:36.209 --> 19:39.610
