00:06.960 --> 00:09.804
How can Gavin Belson claim
that he owns Pied Piper?

00:09.880 --> 00:11.962
I mean, this whole lawsuit
is insane, right?

00:12.280 --> 00:14.123
Well, let me ask you something, Richie.

00:14.240 --> 00:16.641
And I need you to be
totally straight with me.

00:17.800 --> 00:21.691
Was Pied Piper related in any way

00:21.760 --> 00:24.127
to what you were doing
when you were working at Hooli?

00:24.280 --> 00:25.691
No. No, not at all.

00:25.760 --> 00:28.331
I was doing quality assurance
for mobile messaging.

00:28.400 --> 00:30.289
It had nothing to do with compression.

00:30.360 --> 00:32.647
They didn't even have a
compression division at that time.

00:32.759 --> 00:35.684
And did you work on Pied
Piper on Hooli time

00:35.760 --> 00:38.411
or use Hooli equipment
to develop it in any way

00:38.480 --> 00:41.324
- at any time, Richie?
- No, and no.

00:42.840 --> 00:45.241
Great. And by the way,

00:45.320 --> 00:48.403
always tell me that. And
tell yourself that.

00:48.480 --> 00:51.643
Because if you believe
it, a jury will, too.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.648
I do believe it. It's the truth.

00:55.080 --> 00:57.003
Great. That one was even better
than the other one.

00:57.080 --> 00:59.845
I love it. Always say it exactly like that.

01:00.520 --> 01:02.727
Yeah, okay. Look, um...

01:04.160 --> 01:05.969
We're going to win this, right?

01:06.040 --> 01:08.771
Richie, if what you just
told me is the truth,

01:08.880 --> 01:12.441
and don't tell me if you lied,

01:12.520 --> 01:14.010
Gavin's got nothing here.

01:14.080 --> 01:16.447
This is a classic intimidation lawsuit

01:16.520 --> 01:20.241
designed to freeze you until
after Nucleus comes to market.

01:20.320 --> 01:23.324
It's got all the usual
boilerplate nonsense.

01:23.400 --> 01:26.324
"Breach of contract," "unjust enrichment,"

01:26.440 --> 01:27.851
"breach of non-solicitation,"

01:27.920 --> 01:30.605
and the hiring of someone
named Donald Dunn.

01:30.680 --> 01:32.921
Jared. We call him Jared.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.970
Changing his name to get out of it,
clever but irrelevant,

01:36.040 --> 01:39.249
because all we care about are
the intellectual property claims.

01:39.320 --> 01:41.687
And we will win this.

01:42.400 --> 01:44.209
- Good.
- But we're going to have to lawyer up.

01:44.600 --> 01:47.001
What do you mean? Aren't you our lawyer?

01:47.080 --> 01:49.731
I'm not a litigator. That's what you need.

01:50.360 --> 01:51.771
Another lawyer? Really?

01:51.880 --> 01:54.565
Lawyers, Richie.
You don't want to mess around here.

01:54.640 --> 01:57.962
A young start-up with an IP lawsuit
hanging over its head?

01:58.280 --> 02:01.045
I wouldn't want
to be a part of that team.

02:02.360 --> 02:04.647
Well, but you are a part of that team.

02:04.720 --> 02:07.963
I'm part of the team that team is on.

02:08.759 --> 02:11.764
Yeah. It just sounds really expensive.

02:11.840 --> 02:15.401
Says the guy who just got
bukkaked with fat term sheets.

02:15.600 --> 02:17.329
Welcome to the business, Richie.

02:17.400 --> 02:21.007
Look, wherever we're at with your funding,
legal fees will be worked into the deal.

02:21.080 --> 02:23.481
You've got Raviga. You're covered.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.081
Relax.

02:26.200 --> 02:29.010
"We're out"? What do you mean, "We're out"?

02:30.480 --> 02:32.608
Was it not clear from the context?

02:32.960 --> 02:37.010
We, at Raviga, are out of the business
of funding Pied Piper,

02:37.080 --> 02:39.845
at least while the Hooli lawsuit
remains unresolved.

02:39.920 --> 02:42.002
That suit is total nonsense.

02:42.080 --> 02:44.811
Nonsense is not
a quantifiable metric, Monica.

02:44.880 --> 02:46.325
Risk is.

02:46.400 --> 02:49.324
Funding any early-stage company
is a high-risk proposition,

02:49.400 --> 02:51.641
but compound that uncertainty
with a legal cloud

02:51.720 --> 02:54.291
over the company's intellectual property,
and it's untenable.

02:54.400 --> 02:57.847
And that is just the financial risk.
There is also a legal risk.

02:57.920 --> 03:00.002
We could become embroiled in
Gavin Belson's lawsuit

03:00.080 --> 03:01.366
for aiding and abetting.

03:01.440 --> 03:04.922
And there is a political risk for the firm,

03:05.000 --> 03:07.082
but especially for me as its new leader.

03:07.160 --> 03:10.721
I'm being heavily scrutinized
from both within and without.

03:10.960 --> 03:14.851
I cannot have my first decision post-Peter
be one with such dubious fundamentals.

03:14.920 --> 03:16.570
It's a rudimentary decision.

03:16.840 --> 03:18.604
How am I supposed to tell them this?

03:18.800 --> 03:21.849
In my experience, it's best
to look a person in the eye

03:21.920 --> 03:25.288
and deliver the information
with warmth and compassion.

03:27.960 --> 03:29.041
Okay.

03:29.320 --> 03:30.970
One other suggestion.

03:31.040 --> 03:32.883
Dress unattractively when you tell them.

03:32.960 --> 03:36.043
I read a study.
The less sexual interest they feel for you,

03:36.120 --> 03:39.010
the less perturbing it will be.
It sounds strange,

03:39.080 --> 03:40.445
but it's credible.

03:40.520 --> 03:44.889
May I suggest the beige ensemble

03:44.960 --> 03:47.486
in which you came to work... Tuesday?

03:52.000 --> 03:54.480
Things are just really different at Raviga,

03:54.560 --> 03:56.927
and I had nothing to do with the decision.

03:57.480 --> 03:59.801
Guys, I'm so, so sorry.

04:00.440 --> 04:02.169
Wait, so the company
that offered us the most

04:02.240 --> 04:04.766
until Richard talked them
into offering us the least

04:04.840 --> 04:06.205
is now offering us nothing?

04:06.280 --> 04:09.204
But the fact that you're so sorry
makes it all better.

04:09.280 --> 04:11.647
You guys will be fine.
You'll find someone else.

04:11.720 --> 04:15.247
We don't want someone else, Monica.
The whole point of going with you guys

04:15.320 --> 04:17.209
was because we trust you guys.

04:17.360 --> 04:19.761
- Trusted.
- We still have our 5% stake,

04:19.839 --> 04:21.762
and Laurie said that
I can still sit on the board,

04:21.839 --> 04:23.649
which means I can still come to meetings...

04:23.720 --> 04:25.006
Can I say something here?

04:25.160 --> 04:27.925
First off, Monica, you're not fooling
any of us for even a second

04:28.000 --> 04:30.765
with your dress-shitty-to-ease-the-pain
routine.

04:30.840 --> 04:32.569
It's a classic chick break-up move,

04:32.640 --> 04:35.530
and you're not very good at it, either.
You look great.

04:35.960 --> 04:38.247
Yeah, beige is a good color for you.

04:38.320 --> 04:39.685
You're a true autumn.

04:39.840 --> 04:41.763
Secondly, who cares?

04:41.920 --> 04:46.084
We have a three-foot stack of term sheets
from the top VCs on the face of the planet.

04:46.360 --> 04:49.409
So the top one fell out. As Jay Z says,

04:49.480 --> 04:50.811
"On to the next one."

04:50.920 --> 04:52.729
Jared, who's our next best offer?

04:53.000 --> 04:55.844
Between the numbers and the reputation,

04:55.920 --> 04:57.570
that would be Coleman Blair Partners.

04:57.840 --> 04:59.490
I'm gonna go put my face on.

04:59.560 --> 05:02.962
Call Coleman Blair. Tell them that
Santa Claus is coming early this year,

05:03.040 --> 05:06.249
and he's bringing a big bag of Pied Piper.

05:08.400 --> 05:12.200
Well, I'm going to leave this room
without saying goodbye to you.

05:12.760 --> 05:16.207
I'm sure you can find your way out
with one of your two faces.

05:18.080 --> 05:19.844
Sorry about that.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.207
The guys are just a little emotional.

05:22.440 --> 05:24.408
No, I get it.

05:24.560 --> 05:26.688
And look, I probably shouldn't say this,

05:26.760 --> 05:30.048
but there are a lot of
really great VCs in town.

05:30.920 --> 05:33.400
You'll be fine. I just...

05:34.000 --> 05:35.411
Just what?

05:35.600 --> 05:38.410
Just tell them that you're really excited
to be in business with them

05:38.480 --> 05:40.767
and try to close quickly.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.763
You know, while momentum
is still on your side.

05:55.760 --> 05:59.048
Well, it's gonna break a lot of hearts
on Sand Hill Road

05:59.120 --> 06:01.088
but congratulations.

06:01.880 --> 06:04.611
We decided to go with you.

06:06.120 --> 06:09.203
Uh, we were told that
you were going with Raviga.

06:09.320 --> 06:12.085
And I am happy to say
that is no longer the case.

06:12.160 --> 06:14.640
We're really excited to be
in business with you guys.

06:14.720 --> 06:17.530
Can I ask... Did you walk away from them,

06:17.600 --> 06:21.161
or did they walk away from you
because of the lawsuit?

06:21.800 --> 06:24.963
Ah, that lawsuit we know to be frivolous.

06:26.480 --> 06:27.606
Yeah.

06:29.520 --> 06:30.965
Is that a Yes Folder?

06:32.480 --> 06:33.891
No.

06:35.320 --> 06:37.402
So, no pastries today, huh?

06:37.640 --> 06:40.405
So both Raviga
and Coleman Blair Partners passed

06:40.480 --> 06:43.450
- because of the lawsuit?
- Frivolous suit. It's nothing.

06:43.520 --> 06:45.807
Well, it's not nothing.

06:45.880 --> 06:49.202
Look, before we start negging each other...

06:49.280 --> 06:53.285
- Negging?
- It's a term used in sexual manipulation.

06:54.240 --> 06:56.447
Maybe not relevant here.

07:00.520 --> 07:03.046
We're really excited to be
in business with you guys.

07:03.120 --> 07:04.121
Hmm...

07:06.360 --> 07:08.442
We actually see this lawsuit as a positive.

07:08.520 --> 07:12.605
We will win, and it proves
that we have something worth suing over.

07:12.680 --> 07:16.651
And yet Raviga, Coleman Blair Partners

07:16.720 --> 07:19.963
and Wood Opal Fund have all passed.

07:20.800 --> 07:23.531
We're really excited to be
in business with you guys.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.001
Hmm...

07:31.880 --> 07:34.963
You know term sheets aren't
legally binding documents, right?

07:35.040 --> 07:37.486
Of course not. They're just guidelines

07:37.600 --> 07:39.045
that people follow

07:39.600 --> 07:42.001
unless, of course, they're pussies.

07:43.520 --> 07:45.363
You came in here three days ago.

07:45.440 --> 07:48.489
You were arrogant,
condescending and offensive.

07:48.560 --> 07:50.642
Now you come in here,
you call me a pussy...

07:50.720 --> 07:53.485
Whoa! I did not call you a pussy.

07:53.880 --> 07:58.647
I said that people who break
term sheet agreements are pussies,

07:58.720 --> 08:02.088
and that hasn't happened... Yet.

08:02.640 --> 08:06.042
Thus, I haven't called you a pussy... Yet.

08:06.240 --> 08:07.571
You're in control of the situation.

08:07.720 --> 08:11.645
Hooli has the unlimited resources
to hamstring you

08:11.760 --> 08:15.082
until Nucleus comes out, at which point,
they will be the market standard,

08:15.160 --> 08:17.401
and you will be irrelevant.

08:17.480 --> 08:20.689
We're here to invest in innovation,

08:21.160 --> 08:22.161
not lawyers,

08:22.400 --> 08:24.641
so let me be perfectly honest with you.

08:25.080 --> 08:26.844
Your behavior

08:26.920 --> 08:29.400
was boorish and juvenile...

08:29.480 --> 08:32.563
You were rude, vulgar and uncouth.

08:32.760 --> 08:35.842
You were coarse, graceless and puerile.

08:35.919 --> 08:39.366
Obscene, insulting and ignorant.

08:39.440 --> 08:40.566
Ignorant?

08:40.640 --> 08:44.361
You called me a shit-riddled,
anal wasteland.

08:44.440 --> 08:47.922
You called me a chode-gargling fuck-toilet.

08:51.040 --> 08:54.408
We're really excited to be
in business with you guys.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.207
Uh, guys, I hate to panic you

08:57.280 --> 08:59.282
until I'm absolutely sure it's warranted,

08:59.360 --> 09:03.126
but Richard just texted me.
We got our seventh pass.

09:03.560 --> 09:05.722
- Fuck.
- Fuckin' Gavin Belson.

09:05.800 --> 09:07.325
All the VCs turned on us.

09:07.440 --> 09:11.206
Apparently, Erlich used some pretty
assertive vaginal metaphors last round,

09:11.320 --> 09:13.368
so it's been a bit of an uphill climb.

09:13.440 --> 09:15.841
I think we're going have to crunch
our burn-rate again.

09:15.920 --> 09:19.288
Even with the $50,000 from TechCrunch,
we're not going to last very long.

09:19.360 --> 09:20.521
Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no.

09:20.600 --> 09:23.570
Richard said we were going
to split that money, right?

09:23.640 --> 09:24.687
$10,000 each?

09:24.760 --> 09:27.366
I don't think we can
afford to do that anymore.

09:27.440 --> 09:28.521
Fuck!

09:31.000 --> 09:34.447
I just donated $5,000 to my cousin
Wajeed's Kickstarter campaign.

09:35.160 --> 09:39.404
He's trying to get an app
called Bro off the ground.

09:39.480 --> 09:40.481
Bro?

09:40.600 --> 09:42.682
It's a messaging app that
let's you send the word "bro"

09:42.760 --> 09:44.091
to everyone else who has the app.

09:44.160 --> 09:46.003
So it's exactly like the Yo app.

09:46.080 --> 09:48.321
Yes, but less original.

09:48.440 --> 09:50.010
Why don't you just cancel your credit card?

09:50.080 --> 09:52.401
That way Kickstarter can't
collect your pledge.

09:52.480 --> 09:54.847
Well, I would love to,
but he looks up to me.

09:54.920 --> 09:57.685
I was always like the cool cousin
of the family, you know what I mean?

09:57.760 --> 09:59.250
Wait.

09:59.600 --> 10:02.490
Did you just say you
were "the cool cousin"?

10:02.680 --> 10:03.761
Yeah.

10:05.200 --> 10:06.486
Please explain.

10:07.240 --> 10:11.211
Well, when we were kids,
I was the one getting good grades,

10:11.280 --> 10:13.851
I was the one who was
planning for my future,

10:13.920 --> 10:16.730
I would bring gifts for my teachers
'cause they worked so hard.

10:16.800 --> 10:20.361
You know, cool stuff.
He was always getting in trouble,

10:20.440 --> 10:23.649
he got caught smoking opium
in the tool shed,

10:23.720 --> 10:25.643
he crashed my uncle's motorbike.

10:25.720 --> 10:27.404
And you think you're the cool one?

10:27.520 --> 10:29.045
Yeah, it's different in Pakistan.

10:29.120 --> 10:31.407
I've never been, but I know it isn't.

10:31.480 --> 10:35.087
Oh, here it is. Bro 2 Bro is a 1-bit
communication messenger,

10:35.200 --> 10:36.964
"The fastest way to speak your mind."

10:37.040 --> 10:39.247
As long as what's on your mind
is the word "bro."

10:39.640 --> 10:41.961
Well, he's still shy of his goal.

10:42.040 --> 10:44.566
If he doesn't get there,
none of the pledges get collected.

10:46.400 --> 10:49.609
I feel horrible for what I'm about to say,

10:49.680 --> 10:51.170
but I really hope he fails.

10:52.560 --> 10:54.688
That is the first cool
thing you've ever said.

10:56.760 --> 10:59.081
You know what? This may not be an issue.

10:59.280 --> 11:01.442
Richard and Erlich are heading
into their last stop.

11:01.520 --> 11:04.285
I trust Erlich can be
diplomatic and pull it off.

11:04.800 --> 11:08.043
A few days ago, I came in here
and I did some things

11:08.120 --> 11:11.010
and said some things
that I should not have.

11:11.240 --> 11:13.971
Also, we would like to open about
the fact that Pied Piper

11:14.040 --> 11:16.850
is involved in a complicated legal matter

11:16.920 --> 11:19.605
that could affect our potential value.

11:20.600 --> 11:22.602
And that being said, we are open

11:22.680 --> 11:25.763
to renegotiating the funding terms
to reflect that.

11:25.920 --> 11:29.367
But most of all, I want to thank you.

11:29.920 --> 11:31.251
Thank you

11:31.320 --> 11:34.051
for allowing me to come in here today

11:34.120 --> 11:37.488
and be vulnerable and to apologize.

11:39.480 --> 11:42.609
Mr. Bachman, I didn't have you come
all the way back here today

11:42.720 --> 11:44.529
just to apologize to me.

11:44.640 --> 11:47.484
Please, it's Erlich. And you didn't?

11:48.080 --> 11:51.129
Of course not. I asked you back

11:51.200 --> 11:55.171
because three days ago I sat right here,

11:55.240 --> 11:58.369
and I watched you put
your testes on this reclaimed

11:58.440 --> 12:00.727
Brazilian Koa wood table,

12:02.440 --> 12:04.329
and now you're going to sit there

12:04.400 --> 12:06.846
and you're going watch me do the
same goddamn thing to you.

12:07.320 --> 12:09.402
- What? What?
- My turn.

12:09.480 --> 12:11.767
- No. But it's your table!
- Yes, it is my table.

12:11.840 --> 12:13.683
- Oh, man. Please don't do that.
- Good God!

12:14.320 --> 12:16.004
I think you should cancel
your Kickstarter campaign.

12:16.080 --> 12:19.004
- Whoa... What?
- Listen, I love your idea.

12:19.080 --> 12:21.481
- You know I do, right, bro?
- Bro?

12:21.560 --> 12:24.370
Bro? Like, it lets you send the word "bro"
to anyone else that has the app.

12:24.440 --> 12:27.250
I know what it is.
You've explained it to me so many times.

12:27.320 --> 12:29.482
I love it, but you know, I'm not saying...

12:29.680 --> 12:32.206
Other people are, like,
saying horrible stuff.

12:32.280 --> 12:35.409
I'm supporting you, and
they're saying, like,

12:35.480 --> 12:38.086
"Oh, he couldn't get funding,
so he had to go to Kickstarter

12:38.160 --> 12:40.925
"like some charity case
collecting money from strangers,

12:41.000 --> 12:43.765
"like a street beggar
who sits on the ground,

12:43.840 --> 12:46.286
- "eats trash."
- Really?

12:46.360 --> 12:47.885
Yeah.

12:48.640 --> 12:50.768
Look, just between us,

12:50.840 --> 12:53.207
I was thinking about canceling, anyways,

12:53.280 --> 12:55.601
because we're way, way under our goal.

12:55.680 --> 12:58.604
Really? Really?

12:58.680 --> 13:00.444
Like, embarrassingly low.

13:02.800 --> 13:03.881
You know what?

13:04.640 --> 13:06.961
- That sucks.
- It does really suck.

13:07.040 --> 13:08.963
But I think it's the right thing to do.

13:09.040 --> 13:11.691
- Well, you're right.
- 'Cause you don't want bad word of mouth

13:11.760 --> 13:14.240
to kill such a great idea.

13:14.320 --> 13:16.891
Yeah, like with what happened
to your app. Yeah.

13:18.280 --> 13:20.123
What do you mean,
what happened to my app?

13:20.200 --> 13:23.602
Everybody started talking about how bad
it was, and then you ended up giving up.

13:23.680 --> 13:26.331
I didn't give up.
I left to go work on Pied Piper.

13:26.400 --> 13:29.165
So you're saying, then,
that if Pied Piper didn't happen,

13:29.240 --> 13:30.765
you would still be working on your app?

13:30.840 --> 13:33.446
Even though all those people
just shit, like, all over...

13:33.520 --> 13:34.521
Like all of them.

13:35.720 --> 13:37.324
Who are these people?
Who is shitting on it?

13:38.440 --> 13:42.081
Our cousins, Tab, Farooq, Imran
and those people.

13:42.320 --> 13:43.845
This girl I'm fucking.

13:44.760 --> 13:47.366
What have those people ever accomplished?
Nothing!

13:47.760 --> 13:49.922
The girl I'm fucking was in the Olympics.

13:50.160 --> 13:52.731
People are idiots!
Standing on the sidelines criticizing

13:52.800 --> 13:54.962
everyone who's actually
trying to do things.

13:55.240 --> 13:56.241
You really think so?

13:56.400 --> 14:00.371
Yes! Yes! Absolutely! Fuck those people!

14:00.440 --> 14:01.885
You know what?
You're right, you're right.

14:01.960 --> 14:04.042
That's what makes you so cool,

14:04.120 --> 14:05.724
that you have the fucking
backbone to say that.

14:05.800 --> 14:07.404
- Fuck those people.
- Yeah, fuck 'em all.

14:07.480 --> 14:08.766
- Fuck those people.
- Fuck them.

14:08.840 --> 14:11.366
I'm not going to cancel
my Kickstarter Campaign, fuck 'em.

14:11.440 --> 14:13.363
Wait, hold on one second.

14:13.440 --> 14:15.283
Yeah, no, you know what? You're right.
Fuck them.

14:15.360 --> 14:18.603
I'm not going to cancel it,
and I'm going to throw

14:18.680 --> 14:20.125
a huge Kickstarter party.

14:20.200 --> 14:21.690
I'm gonna invite everyone that I know,

14:21.760 --> 14:24.206
and we're going to put Bro over the top.

14:24.280 --> 14:27.363
Everybody, this guy is the coolest cousin!

14:27.440 --> 14:29.681
Thank you for the $5,000, eh?

14:29.760 --> 14:31.410
Whoo!

14:33.800 --> 14:36.167
At least I have the common decency
to shave mine.

14:36.240 --> 14:37.765
Before you pull them out in public?

14:37.840 --> 14:39.922
So you're complaining about the guy's
sense of decorum?

14:40.000 --> 14:42.241
Absolutely. We live in a society.

14:42.360 --> 14:43.964
I can't believe we are this fucked.

14:44.720 --> 14:46.961
Guys, something interesting just happened.

14:47.040 --> 14:49.725
So, I downloaded Wajeed's
Bro app out of curiosity

14:49.800 --> 14:51.450
and found it very sticky.

14:51.520 --> 14:53.682
I've never felt like I
was anyone's bro before.

14:53.760 --> 14:56.491
The only people who have used that term
with me were assailants,

14:56.560 --> 14:59.803
but I started bro-ing people
and getting bro'ed back.

15:00.080 --> 15:01.320
This is my nightmare.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.926
And all of a sudden,
I'm bros with all kinds of people,

15:04.000 --> 15:06.162
including a guy from Branscomb Ventures.

15:06.240 --> 15:09.164
Branscomb? That's a solid shop.

15:09.280 --> 15:11.851
Yes. So we bro'ed about this and that,

15:11.920 --> 15:14.605
and then when he heard
I worked at Pied Piper,

15:14.680 --> 15:18.048
he got excited, he triple liked my bro,
and he asked about meeting us.

15:18.240 --> 15:20.811
Okay, but does he know about the lawsuit?

15:21.120 --> 15:23.600
Yeah, I told him.
I mean, you know what they say,

15:23.680 --> 15:25.762
- "Bros disclose."
- No one says that.

15:25.840 --> 15:28.605
Wait, doesn't Branscomb already
have its own compression play?

15:28.680 --> 15:30.125
Yeah, but not a good one, apparently.

15:30.240 --> 15:33.323
I mean, they want to sit down with
all of us, engineers included.

15:33.760 --> 15:36.206
That only happens
in a second or third meeting.

15:36.280 --> 15:38.203
Technical due diligence. That's good.

15:38.280 --> 15:41.284
Okay, Jared, what did you tell him?

15:41.360 --> 15:44.091
Um, I was waiting a bit to bro him back,

15:44.160 --> 15:45.571
so that I don't seem over-eager.

15:45.640 --> 15:46.880
Bro him back! Bro him back.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.206
Bro him.

15:48.400 --> 15:50.004
We're not dead yet, guys.

15:50.160 --> 15:52.447
Well, get some sleep, my bros.

15:52.520 --> 15:54.887
I'll set the meeting, and, um,

15:54.960 --> 15:57.930
then I'll go find some hoes
to prioritize behind you.

15:59.800 --> 16:01.882
Are you trying to say, "Bros before hoes"?

16:02.160 --> 16:04.527
It's sexist, but it's about friendship.

16:06.560 --> 16:09.325
Middle-out is based on a completely
new probabilistic model.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.289
It finds long range
structures that's hidden

16:11.360 --> 16:14.250
even to domain-optimized algorithms.

16:14.440 --> 16:17.091
I'm sorry, is this too in the weeds?

16:17.160 --> 16:19.288
Not at all. Take us into the weeds.

16:19.440 --> 16:21.807
Wouldn't you rather hear
our go-to-market strategy?

16:21.880 --> 16:23.769
You mentioned something earlier about

16:23.840 --> 16:27.481
stacking Middle-out on top of
another compression algorithm.

16:27.560 --> 16:28.846
How does that even work?

16:28.920 --> 16:32.129
I mean, you can't compress something that's
already compressed to entropy.

16:32.200 --> 16:33.167
Right?

16:33.240 --> 16:34.810
WOW. Uh...

16:34.880 --> 16:37.486
I don't really get too many of
those questions in meetings like these.

16:37.600 --> 16:40.809
But it's actually easier if I show you.

16:40.880 --> 16:42.848
- May I?
- Absolutely.

16:42.920 --> 16:45.730
Okay, great. Here I go.

16:45.800 --> 16:48.849
Stacking Middle-out is actually very real.

16:48.920 --> 16:51.526
- Let's take...
- Do you have to pee, Jared?

16:51.600 --> 16:53.728
Because I have to pee.

16:53.800 --> 16:55.928
I would love to pee.

16:58.160 --> 17:01.164
There.
When you stack Middle-out...

17:03.600 --> 17:05.967
- They're brain-raping us, right?
- They definitely are.

17:06.040 --> 17:08.122
Shit. All right, wait here.

17:15.280 --> 17:17.089
What are you doing?

17:17.160 --> 17:19.208
I told you I didn't have to go pee.
What is happening?

17:19.280 --> 17:21.487
Those guys are never going to fund us.
We need to leave now.

17:21.599 --> 17:23.568
What are you talking about?
This is going great.

17:23.640 --> 17:26.211
I mean, VCs are never interested
in how Middle-out actually works.

17:26.280 --> 17:28.203
Of course they're interested,
because they want to steal it.

17:28.280 --> 17:29.805
This is a classic brain-rape.

17:30.040 --> 17:32.008
- What?
- We did it at Hooli all the time.

17:32.080 --> 17:35.050
We'd schedule meetings with companies
so they'd explain their technology,

17:35.120 --> 17:37.043
then we'd use their ideas in our products.

17:37.160 --> 17:39.242
- Like what happened to Yelp.
- Yes.

17:39.320 --> 17:41.322
It's like when somebody says
they want to go birding with you,

17:41.400 --> 17:43.368
but really they just want to
get you alone in the woods,

17:43.440 --> 17:44.680
so they can take your binoculars.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.321
Look, those guys aren't doing
technical due diligence.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.131
They're not even consultants.
They're a compression company.

17:50.200 --> 17:52.328
One of them has braces, for fuck's sake.

17:52.400 --> 17:54.209
- Braces!
- Shit.

17:54.280 --> 17:55.770
Dinesh and Gilfoyle,
they're still in there.

17:55.840 --> 17:58.969
Middle-out doesn't restrict itself to
H-264's two-dimensional grid

17:59.040 --> 18:00.849
or time-bound patterns at all.

18:00.920 --> 18:03.127
This is great. Great.

18:03.480 --> 18:07.041
You know, they usually don't bring us
to these things and I think I know why.

18:07.120 --> 18:09.248
It's 'cause we steal the show.

18:09.320 --> 18:10.606
You guys are really helpful.

18:10.680 --> 18:12.967
All right, shut it down.
Meeting over. We're out of here.

18:13.040 --> 18:15.122
No more pictures, fucking assholes.

18:15.200 --> 18:17.885
- I could email you...
- Why is this not coming off?

18:18.320 --> 18:20.891
No, you're not emailing anybody.

18:22.440 --> 18:23.771
Thank you, Jared.

18:23.920 --> 18:25.160
We were bros.

18:26.440 --> 18:27.805
We were bros.

18:28.720 --> 18:31.246
Yo, yo, yo,
just want to thank everyone

18:31.320 --> 18:33.368
for coming out to this
Kickstarter party for Bro,

18:33.440 --> 18:35.886
the app that proves
that you can change the world

18:35.960 --> 18:37.530
in just one word!

18:39.360 --> 18:41.806
Actually, it's just half a word.

18:41.880 --> 18:44.008
I know. It's so efficient.

18:44.720 --> 18:47.690
Now as you can see,
we're just $5,000 away from our goal.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.524
But we got a whole hour left, people.

18:49.600 --> 18:51.568
So let's get those "bronations" going.

18:51.640 --> 18:53.290
Donations are funny, right?

18:53.400 --> 18:55.801
I mean, why would anybody
donate to something like Bro

18:55.880 --> 18:58.565
and not a homeless shelter or schools?

18:58.640 --> 19:01.041
Cancer? That's still out there.

19:01.800 --> 19:03.325
Any of us could have it.

19:03.520 --> 19:04.885
Food for thought...

19:05.400 --> 19:07.084
Which a lot of people also don't have.

19:08.200 --> 19:09.440
Have a great party, guys-

19:09.720 --> 19:11.210
You could donate if you want,

19:11.280 --> 19:14.363
but he's throwing away
half the world's market.

19:14.440 --> 19:16.568
You know what "bro" means in Mandarin?

19:16.640 --> 19:18.369
It means "asshole."

19:18.520 --> 19:21.729
You know what "bro" means
in Portuguese? "Rapist."

19:21.920 --> 19:24.651
In Latvian, it roughly translates to

19:24.720 --> 19:27.087
"one who beheads the messiah."

19:27.400 --> 19:30.882
In Finnish, "bro" means
"a baby's erection."

19:31.640 --> 19:35.008
In Urdu, "bro" is actually short for
"brokhtaver,"

19:35.080 --> 19:38.289
which means "a dildo for a man."

19:38.360 --> 19:39.771
A man's dildo.

19:40.520 --> 19:41.965
"Fecal eclipse."

19:42.040 --> 19:43.724
it loses something in translation.

19:43.800 --> 19:45.689
We don't have a word for it. They do.

19:45.760 --> 19:47.171
It's "bro."

19:47.440 --> 19:49.488
You know what "bro" means in Navajo?

19:49.560 --> 19:52.609
A really joyful person
with mental disabilities.

19:52.680 --> 19:54.523
All right, less than a
minute to go, people.

19:54.600 --> 19:57.444
And we're just two grand away.
Come on, you can do it, come on.

19:59.760 --> 20:00.966
That's that I'm talking about!

20:01.040 --> 20:04.487
$500 from Gilfoyle_Luci4.

20:04.560 --> 20:07.769
Where you at, bro?
Wherever you're at, you're my bro.

20:12.200 --> 20:13.884
Looks like I got here just in time, bro.

20:13.960 --> 20:16.281
What the fuck did you do that for?
Do you know how this works?

20:16.400 --> 20:18.084
If you put him over the edge,
we both owe him money?

20:18.160 --> 20:20.891
But you have to pay a lot more.

20:20.960 --> 20:23.406
- 30 seconds left!
- I'm effectively leveraging your misery.

20:23.480 --> 20:24.447
Somebody! Anybody!

20:24.520 --> 20:25.965
I'm like the Warren Buffett
of fucking with you.

20:26.040 --> 20:28.725
- $1,100! Come on, bros.
- You're a dick.

20:28.800 --> 20:32.247
Only $1,100 left. I might be good for that.

20:32.720 --> 20:35.485
- Gilfoyle, please.
- I'll tell you what.

20:35.560 --> 20:38.928
You pay me $500, and I
won't pledge anymore.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.287
For 500 bucks, you save $5,000.

20:41.480 --> 20:42.845
I'm not giving you a dime.

20:42.920 --> 20:44.570
- Nine, eight, seven...
- Okay, I'm pledging.

20:44.680 --> 20:47.763
No. Stop. $500. It costs $500. Let me...
Stop it. $500.

20:47.840 --> 20:49.080
- Okay.
- Three, two...

20:49.160 --> 20:51.527
it doesn't matter.
It's not like he's going to make his...

20:54.160 --> 20:55.321
What the fuck?

20:55.440 --> 20:57.920
Yes, yes, yes! We did it! Who was it?

20:58.000 --> 20:59.650
That's not how that was supposed to go.

20:59.760 --> 21:01.922
Mika! Mika, I love you, Mika!

21:03.360 --> 21:05.567
Who is that tall Asian woman?

21:06.720 --> 21:08.927
Some woman that Wajeed is fucking.

21:09.800 --> 21:11.450
She was in the Olympics.

21:11.520 --> 21:12.521
Ah...

21:14.200 --> 21:16.441
He really is the cool cousin.

21:17.400 --> 21:19.402
Even with the 50 grand
we got at TechCrunch,

21:19.480 --> 21:22.290
we've only got a few weeks left to runway
before we crash and burn.

21:22.360 --> 21:24.089
Richard, if it makes you feel any better,

21:24.160 --> 21:26.208
I put that Branscomb guy in his place.

21:26.280 --> 21:27.645
I dropped him from Bro,

21:27.720 --> 21:30.530
but not before I sent
one final angry "bro."

21:31.160 --> 21:33.845
What do you mean? You can make them
angry? You can make "bros" angry?

21:34.120 --> 21:36.521
Well, he made this bro angry.

21:36.600 --> 21:40.047
But technically, no,
the "bro" I sent was identical

21:40.120 --> 21:41.121
to the previous "bros" I sent,

21:41.200 --> 21:43.646
but I think he'll infer
the anger from context.

21:43.720 --> 21:45.404
This is Ron on the phone. I gotta take it.

21:45.480 --> 21:46.766
Yeah, okay.

21:47.720 --> 21:48.960
- Hello, Ron.
- Hey, Richie.

21:49.040 --> 21:50.883
I gotta bounce on over
to my mind-body thing,

21:50.960 --> 21:52.962
but I just wanted to
give you the good news.

21:53.080 --> 21:56.448
I got you a top-shelf litigator.

21:56.720 --> 21:59.166
Yeah, uh,
we should probably discuss that.

21:59.240 --> 22:01.891
You're gonna sweat me
about the cost, right? Don't.

22:01.960 --> 22:05.248
I hammered them on their fee.
They're going to bring it way down.

22:05.320 --> 22:07.322
Okay, so how much?

22:07.520 --> 22:13.448
This whole thing is going
to cost you two, 2.5 million tops.

22:13.560 --> 22:16.564
- What?
- I know, right. It's like it's free.

22:16.640 --> 22:18.847
I told you, I pay for myself.

22:18.920 --> 22:21.685
So I'm going to need you
to head on down to their offices tomorrow

22:21.760 --> 22:25.162
at 10:00 a.m.
You slap an 80K retainer on them,

22:25.280 --> 22:27.169
and we are good to go.

22:27.400 --> 22:29.004
Oh, shit.

22:30.440 --> 22:32.522
Okay, I actually have another call, so...

22:32.600 --> 22:33.931
I'll get out of your pubes.

22:34.040 --> 22:37.044
I'm emailing you intros to the
guys you're meeting tomorrow.

22:37.120 --> 22:38.281
Later.

22:40.680 --> 22:41.761
Hello?

22:43.040 --> 22:45.281
Oh. Uh, hello.

22:45.800 --> 22:46.847
Yes.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.001
Uh-huh.

22:51.160 --> 22:53.447
Sure, just me?

22:54.960 --> 22:56.450
Okay, what time?

23:02.960 --> 23:04.121
Hello.

23:04.520 --> 23:06.682
Richard. Thanks for coming.

23:11.800 --> 23:12.801
What are we doing, Richard?

23:13.160 --> 23:14.605
Lawsuits and lawyers?

23:14.760 --> 23:18.606
You out there getting rejected
by every VC in town?

23:18.680 --> 23:20.091
Neither of us want this,

23:20.160 --> 23:22.970
but maybe together we can find a way out.

23:23.480 --> 23:25.403
Yeah, easy. Drop the lawsuit.

23:25.640 --> 23:28.484
- You know I can't do that.
- I didn't steal Pied Piper from you,

23:28.560 --> 23:29.561
and you know it.

23:29.840 --> 23:32.081
Well, that's up to the courts to decide.

23:32.160 --> 23:33.650
And until they do, you're frozen.

23:33.840 --> 23:36.446
Meanwhile, my best engineers
are working around the clock

23:36.560 --> 23:38.801
to get me a Middle-out algorithm
that surpasses yours.

23:38.880 --> 23:41.611
And in January when we have it
and we come to market,

23:41.680 --> 23:43.523
you won’t just be frozen, you'll be dead.

23:43.840 --> 23:45.968
You played your best hand,
Richard, and you lost.

23:46.160 --> 23:48.527
It's just business. So...

23:48.680 --> 23:52.651
Wouldn't you rather get something
out of Pied Piper while you still can?

23:53.240 --> 23:56.562
- Let me acquire you.
- What? No way. Are you kidding me?

23:56.640 --> 23:58.130
We should have just done
this the first time.

23:58.200 --> 24:00.771
I know you thought about it.
It's the perfect fit.

24:00.840 --> 24:03.161
You get my infrastructure,
I get your speed,

24:03.240 --> 24:06.130
and I get it today rather
than in a month or two.

24:06.200 --> 24:07.361
What's the downside?

24:07.440 --> 24:09.169
The downside is that
everything I'm building

24:09.240 --> 24:11.891
becomes the property of your giant
soulless corporation.

24:12.520 --> 24:14.522
And what exactly
do you think you're building?

24:14.640 --> 24:17.644
You're out there trying to get funding
so you can hire people,

24:17.720 --> 24:19.961
scale up, roll out a product, IPO,

24:20.040 --> 24:23.169
and eventually become
a publicly-traded what?

24:23.920 --> 24:25.206
Corporation.

24:25.320 --> 24:26.446
We would be different.

24:26.520 --> 24:29.683
I see. I suppose once Pied Piper
is a billion-dollar company,

24:29.760 --> 24:32.889
you'll seek out your competitors
and help them.

24:33.400 --> 24:34.925
Please. Let's face it.

24:35.000 --> 24:39.130
What is Hooli if not the best possible
future version of Pied Piper?

24:39.200 --> 24:41.123
You think you're building
something different? No.

24:41.200 --> 24:44.170
You're building something that's exactly
the same as what I've already built,

24:44.240 --> 24:47.642
except with you instead of me.
But that's not possible now, Richard.

24:48.080 --> 24:51.766
But you know what is? We could build
something together, you and me.

24:51.840 --> 24:55.003
Something great.
Something the world needs now.

24:55.440 --> 24:56.930
Look, I don't have to do this.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.163
I'm just trying to do the right thing here.

25:05.440 --> 25:08.250
So, what do you say?

25:10.880 --> 25:12.530
You want to know what I say?

25:15.200 --> 25:16.964
Okay, here's what I say.
