WEBVTT

00:14.806 --> 00:18.935
MAN:
Captain's log,
stardate 57436.2.

00:19.018 --> 00:21.771
The Cerritos is docked
at Douglas Station

00:21.855 --> 00:24.816
for routine maintenance
and resupply.

00:24.899 --> 00:26.901
We will soon set course
for the capital planet

00:26.985 --> 00:28.820
on the Galar system,
where we're scheduled

00:28.903 --> 00:32.449
to make second contact with
the Galardonian high council.

00:32.532 --> 00:34.117
First contact is a delicate,

00:34.200 --> 00:36.286
high-stakes
operation of diplomacy.

00:36.369 --> 00:39.456
One must be ready for anything
when humanity is interacting

00:39.539 --> 00:42.584
with an alien race
for the first time.

00:42.667 --> 00:44.669
But we don't do that.

00:44.753 --> 00:46.671
Our specialty is second contact.

00:46.755 --> 00:47.714
Still pretty important.

00:47.797 --> 00:49.174
We get all the paperwork signed,

00:49.257 --> 00:50.967
make sure we're spelling
the name of the planet right,

00:51.050 --> 00:52.635
get to know
all the good places to eat.

00:52.719 --> 00:54.471
(gasps, laughs)

00:54.554 --> 00:56.014
Oh, my God.
What are you doing?

00:56.097 --> 00:57.640
-Uh, nothing, nothing, nothing.
I'm just...
-Oh, no.

00:57.724 --> 00:59.476
-Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
-(grunting)

00:59.559 --> 01:01.144
-(shrieks)
-Are you pretending to do
a captain's log?

01:01.227 --> 01:02.979
-(whimpers) We're all supposed
to keep logs.
-(laughs)

01:03.062 --> 01:04.856
-Okay, let me listen to it.
-No. Go away.

01:04.939 --> 01:06.191
-Leave me alone. No. No.
-Ah! I can't believe

01:06.274 --> 01:07.776
you're wasting
your shore leave on this.

01:07.859 --> 01:08.943
-Privacy, please.
-Aah! Hey, time to go.

01:09.027 --> 01:10.278
-Come on. Get out of
your little closet.
-Privacy.

01:10.361 --> 01:11.863
-(grunts)
-Let's go. Come on.

01:11.946 --> 01:12.906
(gasps)
Are you drunk?

01:12.989 --> 01:14.157
Yeah, dude, you should be, too.

01:14.240 --> 01:15.658
I mean, this station is amazing.

01:15.742 --> 01:17.160
And they have Romulan whiskey.

01:17.243 --> 01:18.828
And I bet you thought
it was going to be green,

01:18.912 --> 01:20.538
but it is actually blue.
It's this very beautiful color.

01:20.622 --> 01:22.040
Romulan whiskey is
against regulation.

01:22.123 --> 01:23.666
Yeah, 'cause it's awesome.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.126
Aw, man, they got
all sorts of great stuff.

01:25.210 --> 01:26.795
Oh! Oh! Come on, check this out.

01:26.878 --> 01:28.171
-(grunts) Oh, yeah.
-Ah! Be careful with that!

01:28.254 --> 01:29.798
Pretty sweet, right?

01:29.881 --> 01:31.299
Yeah, it's a Klingon bat,
um, bat, uh, bat--

01:31.382 --> 01:33.301
I don't know. I'm not
a scientist. It doesn't matter.

01:33.384 --> 01:35.136
-Shut up. I got it from
an old guy with an eye patch.
-Hey, hey.

01:35.220 --> 01:37.555
Come spar with me. Come on!
Oh, we can be Klingons.

01:37.639 --> 01:39.307
We can have crimped hair,
wrinkled foreheads.

01:39.390 --> 01:40.642
-Worf, Worf, Worf.
-It's got crusty blood on it!

01:40.725 --> 01:43.853
-(deep voice): I love honor!
I demand honor!
-Hey, stop. Stop!

Ensign D'Vana Tendi,
reporting for duty.

03:20.074 --> 03:21.618
I'm a transfer from Outpost 79.

03:21.701 --> 03:23.244
Deck Four.
Follow the yellow line.

03:23.328 --> 03:24.621
Take the turbolift
all the way down.

03:24.704 --> 03:26.080
Thank you so much.

03:26.164 --> 03:27.624
And can I just say
that I'm really honored to be...

03:27.707 --> 03:28.917
Keep it moving, lower decks.

Next!

03:31.878 --> 03:33.296
REPLICATOR:
Banana, hot.

03:33.379 --> 03:34.297
Banana, hot.

03:34.380 --> 03:36.090
Aah! Frickin' burned me.

03:36.174 --> 03:38.259
Uh, i-is there
an Ensign Boimler here?

03:38.343 --> 03:39.260
REPLICATOR:
Banana, hot.

03:39.344 --> 03:40.303
(grunting)

03:40.386 --> 03:41.804
Hi. Here, that's me. Ahoy.

03:41.888 --> 03:42.805
Ensign Tendi reporting for duty.

03:42.889 --> 03:44.307
You're my orientation liaison.

03:44.390 --> 03:46.893
Yes, welcome. Brad Boimler,
Ensign, command division.

03:46.976 --> 03:48.269
(gasps) Ah! Oh, my gosh.

03:48.353 --> 03:49.854
I've never worked
with commanders before.

03:49.938 --> 03:51.147
I'm in sciences.

03:51.230 --> 03:53.107
I love science.
Uh, it's so sciency.

03:53.191 --> 03:54.943
I mean, that blue goes green
with your great--

03:55.026 --> 03:55.985
-I mean, great, with your--
oh, my gosh.
-Yo-yo, what up?

03:56.069 --> 03:58.363
Beckett Mariner, also an ensign,
command division,

03:58.446 --> 04:00.657
but not quite as
impressed with myself

04:00.740 --> 04:02.659
as this little rascal over here.

04:02.742 --> 04:04.243
Yeah, we're not actual
commanders, by the way,

04:04.327 --> 04:06.120
-we're more like
commanders-in-training.
-(squeals)

04:06.204 --> 04:07.997
I can't believe
we're gonna serve side by side,

04:08.081 --> 04:10.333
scientists and commanders,
an elite team.

04:10.416 --> 04:11.542
Yeah, no,
we're not really elite.

04:11.626 --> 04:14.295
We're more like the cool,
scrappy underdogs of the ship.

04:14.379 --> 04:15.964
You know,
we don't wash our hands,

04:16.047 --> 04:17.340
we're doing kickflips
all the time.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.175
But with focus and dedication,

04:19.258 --> 04:22.345
you could be
chief medical officer someday.

04:22.428 --> 04:23.846
Oh, senior officers
are overrated.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.014
They're always, like,
stressed out

04:25.098 --> 04:26.683
and just yelling
about directives.

04:26.766 --> 04:28.685
It is better down here,
where the real action is.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.353
You really don't care
about moving up in rank?

04:30.436 --> 04:32.313
Been there, definitely over it.

04:32.397 --> 04:34.816
Whenever you think for yourself,
they knock you back down.

04:34.899 --> 04:36.359
You know, for someone
who claims to hate rank,

04:36.442 --> 04:38.069
you certainly bring it up a lot.

04:38.152 --> 04:39.862
Yes, I'm very complicated,
thank you.

04:39.946 --> 04:42.824
-Ooh, you want the tour?
-O-Of the-the ship? Uh, yes!

04:42.907 --> 04:44.033
You don't like giving the tour.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.994
True, but I do...
(clears throat)

04:46.077 --> 04:47.328
...have a big box
of shore leave contraband

04:47.412 --> 04:48.997
I need help with.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.499
BOIMLER: The senior officers
are all up here,

04:51.582 --> 04:53.835
then you've got Engineering,
science stations.

04:53.918 --> 04:57.046
All sorts of ops around here...

04:57.130 --> 04:59.716
Ops, ops, ops, storage, ops.

04:59.799 --> 05:01.718
Actually, there's like
a ton of ops.

05:01.801 --> 05:04.345
-It's like, guys,
I think we have ops covered.
-(groaning)

05:04.429 --> 05:06.347
-And we're here?
-Well, no. We're actually way
down here.

05:06.431 --> 05:07.890
MARINER:
What this map doesn't show you

05:07.974 --> 05:10.268
is that everything from,
like, this deck up,

05:10.351 --> 05:11.728
super lame, not important to us.

05:11.811 --> 05:12.729
-You like the bar.
-All right, fine.

05:12.812 --> 05:14.897
-Everything except the bar.
-And the bridge.

05:14.981 --> 05:16.024
-The bridge is not cool.
-Yes, it is.

05:16.107 --> 05:17.358
Oh, hey, that's Rutherford.

05:17.442 --> 05:18.735
Rutherford, what's up?

05:18.818 --> 05:21.070
(exhales, speaks gibberish)

05:21.154 --> 05:22.905
Yo, yo, yo, slow down.
Is your thingy acting up?

05:22.989 --> 05:24.407
Rutherford's an engineer, oh,
and, as of a couple weeks ago,

05:24.490 --> 05:26.034
cybernetically enhanced.

05:26.117 --> 05:28.411
Ooh, I've never met
a recent cyborg.

05:28.494 --> 05:30.747
Hey, nice to meet you.
Welcome to the crew.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.874
Wait, don't you have a date
with Ensign Barnes tonight?

05:32.957 --> 05:35.251
-Sure do.
-She's crazy hot.
Are you nervous?

05:35.334 --> 05:38.421
Trying to be, but this thing
keeps tamping it down.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.214
Yikes. Okay, you got it.

05:40.298 --> 05:42.383
Uh-oh, I'm nervous.
What if I say something stupid?

05:42.467 --> 05:44.218
What if she doesn't like
the way that I look?

05:44.302 --> 05:46.888
Ah, I can only look one way.
I can't change it by tonight!

05:46.971 --> 05:48.473
-Better?
-Yeah, thanks. (gasps)

05:48.556 --> 05:50.349
What if she hates my jokes?
I don't know any jokes.

05:50.433 --> 05:51.809
Oh, I'm gonna puke.

05:51.893 --> 05:53.102
What else?

05:53.186 --> 05:54.312
That's a room
of switches and dials

05:54.395 --> 05:55.313
you'll never need to go into.

05:55.396 --> 05:57.106
It's actually a pretty important
processing hub.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.567
Nobody knows what that room is.

05:59.650 --> 06:01.235
It's a pattern-buffer
maintenance access.

06:01.319 --> 06:02.403
She knows that.
She's being funny.

06:02.487 --> 06:04.489
Ah, and this is
Boimler's hidey closet,

06:04.572 --> 06:06.574
where he pretends to be
a captain like a big boy.

06:06.657 --> 06:07.992
This is not a good tour!

06:09.577 --> 06:11.079
So, yeah, we kind of sleep
in a hallway.

06:11.162 --> 06:12.914
It's a little disappointing,

06:12.997 --> 06:15.124
but eventually, when you rank
up, you get your own room.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.126
We're pretty close
to the showers, which is nice.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.128
Does get kind of musty, though.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.589
Which is weird
'cause the showers are sonic.

06:21.672 --> 06:24.383
Whoa. Whoa.

06:25.551 --> 06:27.470
It's... perfect.

06:27.553 --> 06:29.472
Well, once you get settled,
you should probably check in

06:29.555 --> 06:31.140
with Nurse Westlake in Medical.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.350
You'll be assisting him
with some basic...

06:32.433 --> 06:34.102
Ooh, let's go check out
the holodeck.

06:34.185 --> 06:35.937
-She doesn't have time for that.
-How do you know?

06:36.020 --> 06:37.105
Because I'm her liaison.

06:37.188 --> 06:38.147
Oh, yeah, then what time is it?

06:38.231 --> 06:40.983
And don't check, because
if she doesn't have time,

06:41.067 --> 06:42.860
then you should know
what time it is.

06:42.944 --> 06:45.154
Otherwise, you're just trying
to sound important.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.448
So, what time is it?

06:47.532 --> 06:48.825
Welcome to the holodeck.

06:48.908 --> 06:50.284
Easily the best part
of the ship.

06:50.368 --> 06:52.161
The warp core is
the best part of the ship,

06:52.245 --> 06:53.079
uh, followed by the bridge,

06:53.162 --> 06:55.039
the photon torpedo tubes,
cetacean ops...

06:55.123 --> 06:56.833
Dude, the warp core is just
a big glowing tube.

06:56.916 --> 06:59.001
I love the warp core.
The warp core rules.

06:59.085 --> 07:00.294
No, it doesn't.

07:00.378 --> 07:02.296
Computer,
find us a beach in Hawaii.

07:02.380 --> 07:03.339
-(seagulls squawking)
-(Tendi gasps)

07:03.422 --> 07:04.507
What is this?

07:04.590 --> 07:07.385
This stuff is crazy.
What does it do?

07:07.468 --> 07:09.137
Oh, it just gets everywhere
and gives you a rash.

07:09.220 --> 07:10.388
You get a rash from sand?

07:10.471 --> 07:12.014
-What, you don't?
-No. Nobody does.

07:12.098 --> 07:13.891
Oh, God, I always do.

07:13.975 --> 07:15.518
Go ahead, take her for a spin.

07:15.601 --> 07:18.646
Computer, can you put us in
the Adashake Center on Orion?

07:20.231 --> 07:23.151
Wow, I never made time
to go before I enlisted.

07:23.234 --> 07:26.237
Pretty cool, right? You can go
almost anywhere you can imagine.

07:26.320 --> 07:28.197
-Come on, Boimler.
Give it a whirl.
-I-I don't know.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.533
Come on, there has to be
somewhere you'd love to be.

07:30.616 --> 07:33.536
Um... (gasps)
Computer, show us the warp core.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.497
Wow! Amazing.

07:36.581 --> 07:38.875
What an impressive feat
of engineering.

07:38.958 --> 07:41.043
(sighs)
You really bum me out sometimes.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.420
STEVENS (over comm):
Ensign Boimler,
report to the bridge.

07:42.503 --> 07:44.297
(gasps) You work on the bridge?

07:44.380 --> 07:45.423
Yeah. That's right.

07:45.506 --> 07:48.050
Because they appreciate people
who follow the rules.

07:48.134 --> 07:49.385
Who's boring now?

07:49.468 --> 07:50.678
On my way.

07:50.761 --> 07:52.555
Wow, does he get
to go up there a lot?

07:52.638 --> 07:54.891
Nah, just whenever someone
spills a drink or something.

07:54.974 --> 07:56.559
Computer, load Mariner program

07:56.642 --> 07:58.394
"all-nude Olympic
training facility."

07:58.477 --> 08:00.229
You might want to back up a bit.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.190
(men grunting)

08:02.273 --> 08:05.234
Wow, this is
a very detailed program.

08:14.452 --> 08:15.912
Farewell, Commander.

08:15.995 --> 08:17.538
Thanks again for
your hospitality, Chancellor.

08:17.622 --> 08:20.374
We'll be sending construction
teams down to help with the...

08:20.458 --> 08:22.210
to help with
the subspace comm array

08:22.293 --> 08:24.045
as soon as we load up
the supplies.

08:24.128 --> 08:26.589
Ransom to Cerritos.
Five to beam up.

08:31.719 --> 08:33.387
Should you get that looked at,
sir?

08:33.471 --> 08:35.097
Eh, I'll be fine.

08:35.181 --> 08:37.391
-Want to grab a drink tonight?
-(laughs) You know it.

08:37.475 --> 08:40.561
Nothing like a cold beer
after a smooth second contact.

08:40.645 --> 08:42.104
Now,
that's what I'm talking about.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.649

08:58.037 --> 09:00.248
Sorry, what?

09:00.331 --> 09:03.125
I said why aren't you
at your post, Ensign?

09:03.209 --> 09:04.961
Ransom, report.

09:05.044 --> 09:06.963
Coordination with the
Galardonian high council

09:07.046 --> 09:08.464
is ahead of schedule, Captain.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.632
Excellent. Keep me posted.

09:09.715 --> 09:11.759
Ensign, you're with me.

09:15.221 --> 09:16.180
Brad Boimler.

09:16.264 --> 09:19.976
Born Modesto, California,
commissioned in '79.

09:20.059 --> 09:22.478
Not a single demerit.
You keep a personal log?

09:22.562 --> 09:24.772
-Sometimes five a day.
-That's excessive.

09:24.855 --> 09:26.649
Do you see a captain's chair
in your future?

09:26.732 --> 09:29.151
-I hope so, ma'am.
-Well, I see a lot of potential

09:29.235 --> 09:32.655
in you, son, which is why I'm
giving you a special assignment.

09:32.738 --> 09:35.283
Really? I mean, of course,
yes, whatever you need.

09:35.366 --> 09:36.993
Keep an eye on Ensign Mariner.

09:37.076 --> 09:40.162
If she breaks protocol,
I want a full report.

09:40.246 --> 09:42.707
Sorry, ma'am,
is something wrong?

09:42.790 --> 09:45.459
I like my crew working
in lockstep.

09:45.543 --> 09:47.628
There isn't any wiggle room
on the Cerritos.

09:47.712 --> 09:50.631
Not when lives are at stake.
Do you disagree?

09:50.715 --> 09:53.050
-No, ma'am.
-Good. Dismissed.

09:53.134 --> 09:57.054
Ensign, let's keep this
between us, shall we?

09:59.307 --> 10:00.641
RUTHERFORD (laughs):
What? Oh, man,

10:00.725 --> 10:02.685
I would kill to work
on the deflector dish.

10:02.768 --> 10:05.146
Most of my day is spent
repairing food replicators.

10:05.229 --> 10:07.356
-They really break that often?
-Only when you get food in 'em.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.524
Ah, at least
you don't have to be around

10:08.607 --> 10:09.525
Lieutenant Commander Billups.

10:09.608 --> 10:10.818
Knowing how to talk to women

10:10.901 --> 10:13.154
is kind of that guy's
final frontier.

10:13.237 --> 10:14.405
(both laugh)

10:14.488 --> 10:16.490
-That is illogical!
-Oh! S-Sorry.

10:16.574 --> 10:17.408
I-Is he a friend of yours?

10:17.491 --> 10:19.660
No, no, no, no--
it's this Vulcan implant.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.662
It keeps on randomly suppressing
my emotional reactions.

10:21.746 --> 10:23.497
Sorry if this
is making it weird.

10:23.581 --> 10:25.416
I'm just not used
to being a cyborg yet.

10:25.499 --> 10:27.752
Actually, my dad was a cyborg.

10:29.795 --> 10:31.422
Shaxs drop his latte again?

10:31.505 --> 10:33.549
-(chuckles)
Guy's got baby hands.
-No.

10:33.632 --> 10:35.551
"Computer, send me a suck-up
to clean up my mess.

10:35.634 --> 10:37.553
I have a giant torso
and little hands. Over."

10:37.636 --> 10:40.514
-(chuckles) Right?
-Yeah, hilarious.

10:42.433 --> 10:45.269
BILLUPS:
All right, people,
you know the plan.

10:45.353 --> 10:49.774
Let's get this array set up
so the, uh, "Galardonians"

10:49.857 --> 10:52.276
can communicate with the rest
of the Federation.

10:55.863 --> 10:58.199
Oh, man, this is really nice.

10:58.282 --> 11:00.368
I'm glad we got to sit down
and get to know each other

11:00.451 --> 11:01.535
without any interruptions.

11:01.619 --> 11:03.579
(laughs, grunts)

11:03.662 --> 11:04.705
(screaming)

11:04.789 --> 11:06.540
(both laugh)

11:06.624 --> 11:08.793
(bystanders screaming)

11:19.178 --> 11:21.389
CREWMAN:
Set phasers to stun!

11:21.472 --> 11:23.599
(screaming)

11:23.682 --> 11:25.643
So, where are you quartered?

11:25.726 --> 11:28.729
Deck Nine, by the squash courts.

11:28.813 --> 11:30.815
Someone brought a virus
back from the planet.

11:30.898 --> 11:34.693
This is happening
all over the ship.

11:34.777 --> 11:36.779
I've never played squash.
Is it fun?

11:36.862 --> 11:38.739
We should play sometime.

11:38.823 --> 11:41.534
(alarm blaring)

11:43.911 --> 11:45.579
Oh, yeah, it's all gonna be
over subspace.

11:45.663 --> 11:47.665
You're gonna love it.

11:55.548 --> 11:56.590
Unbelievable.

11:59.718 --> 12:01.220
(creatures snarling)

12:02.388 --> 12:04.306
Hey, you. Green girl!

12:04.390 --> 12:05.558
Strap patients down
as they come in.

12:05.641 --> 12:07.685
Double them up if you have to.
They aren't going to infect

12:07.768 --> 12:10.438
-each other twice.
-But, uh, uh,

12:10.521 --> 12:12.690
I was actually supposed to be
assisting Nurse Westlake.

12:12.773 --> 12:14.817
That is Nurse Westlake.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.819
(snarling)

12:16.902 --> 12:19.822
Wow, it's such an honor
to meet you, sir.

12:19.905 --> 12:22.658
I'm looking forward
to working with you.

12:27.955 --> 12:29.498
-Aha!
-(shouts)

12:29.582 --> 12:30.875
Boimler!
Ugh, don't jump out at people.

12:30.958 --> 12:33.335
For real, man. You're lucky
I didn't phaser you.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.504
You're selling Federation
weapons to these guys,

12:35.588 --> 12:36.755
-aren't you?
-Yo, calm down.

12:36.839 --> 12:38.299
No!

12:38.382 --> 12:40.634
I'm sick of you
pushing me around!

12:40.718 --> 12:43.471
Explain yourself right here!

12:43.554 --> 12:44.972
Boims, you need to shut up.
Listen to me.

12:45.055 --> 12:46.474
You know nothing.
Shut your mouth.

12:46.557 --> 12:48.184
Uh, we're just gonna take off.

12:48.267 --> 12:50.478
-(shouts)
-Nobody move!

12:50.561 --> 12:52.855
Selling Starfleet technology
without the express consent

12:52.938 --> 12:55.524
of the Federation Council
is a breach of regulations

12:55.608 --> 12:56.984
498 and 756 of...

12:57.067 --> 12:59.612
And regulations 25, 15, 348.

12:59.695 --> 13:01.906
You're breaking 76 just
for pointing that phaser at me.

13:01.989 --> 13:03.657
Fine, you know
more regulations than me.

13:03.741 --> 13:04.825
I still have to stop you.

13:04.909 --> 13:06.702
It's farm equipment, you idiot.

13:06.785 --> 13:08.662
-They're farmers.
-I'm not an idiot.

13:08.746 --> 13:10.706
You expect me
to believe that...?

13:10.789 --> 13:12.750
Shovel and hoe?

13:14.460 --> 13:16.378
(snarls)

13:19.006 --> 13:20.841
(roaring)

13:20.925 --> 13:22.593
Run, idiot!

13:30.476 --> 13:31.727
(whispers):
What's it doing?

13:31.810 --> 13:33.687
It's shooting butt-webbing
at a tree.

13:33.771 --> 13:35.022
I-It looks pretty pissed.

13:35.105 --> 13:36.023
Well, I hope you're happy.

13:36.106 --> 13:37.858
You left your post.

13:37.942 --> 13:40.569
Oh, I am so sorry I made sure
that some humble farmers,

13:40.653 --> 13:42.738
who can't afford to wait
for Starfleet bureaucracy

13:42.821 --> 13:44.865
to notice them, got some help
so they didn't have to starve.

13:44.949 --> 13:46.742
How did you even know
these guys exist?

13:51.705 --> 13:54.750
Because I was here for first
contact last year on the Quito,

13:54.833 --> 13:57.628
before I got my ass demoted
and transferred to the Cerritos.

13:57.711 --> 13:59.755
Well, I didn't know that.

13:59.838 --> 14:02.758
I have served on five ships,
man. I have seen stuff.

14:02.841 --> 14:04.718
One time, I got trapped
in a sentient cave for weeks.

14:04.802 --> 14:06.804
You ever been trapped
in a sentient cave?

14:06.887 --> 14:08.931
That's a dark place
that knows things.

14:09.014 --> 14:11.600
I almost got my head taken off
by a singing crystal.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.769
I've been in a Klingon prison
where I had to fight a yeti

14:13.852 --> 14:15.729
for my own shoes for no reason.

14:15.813 --> 14:17.398
He was just being a dick.

14:17.481 --> 14:18.566
You've been on, what,
four planets?

14:18.649 --> 14:20.734
Five, if you include Vulcan.

14:20.818 --> 14:21.777
Of course I don't
include stupid Vulcan.

14:21.860 --> 14:22.945
You may as well count Earth.

14:23.028 --> 14:24.863
I was counting Earth.

14:24.947 --> 14:27.950
(sighs) You don't know anything
except what's in your manuals.

14:28.033 --> 14:29.743
Since you can't think
for yourself, how about you

14:29.827 --> 14:31.453
follow my lead, and maybe
we'll get out of this alive?

14:31.537 --> 14:33.956
Ensign Boimler to Cerritos.
Two for emergency trans...

14:34.039 --> 14:35.416
(shouts)

14:36.417 --> 14:37.585
Are you insane?

14:37.668 --> 14:40.087
We can't just beam out of here.
These guys need that animal.

14:40.170 --> 14:42.798
-Even if it eats us?
-General Order 5.

14:42.881 --> 14:44.508
Fine, okay.
How about we stun it?

14:44.592 --> 14:46.677
-We'll just stun it.
-No. That could spoil the milk.

14:46.760 --> 14:48.429
-Spoil what milk?
-These guys probably milk it.

14:48.512 --> 14:49.805
-Oh, like you even know.
-(gasps) Ooh.

14:49.888 --> 14:51.849
-Take off your pants.
-(gasps) Mariner.

14:51.932 --> 14:53.017
(creature snarling, thudding)

14:53.100 --> 14:54.977
-(yelps)
-Five ships.

14:55.060 --> 14:56.687
Yeti shoes. I am always right.

14:56.770 --> 14:58.522
Take them off now.

15:02.526 --> 15:04.320
(bellows)

15:04.403 --> 15:05.988
MARINER:
Yes, it's working.

15:06.071 --> 15:08.616
Man, look at that thing
just tear into that dummy.

15:08.699 --> 15:10.117
Okay, here we go,
get ready to jump.

15:10.200 --> 15:11.368
Wait, why isn't it
attacking your uniform?

15:11.452 --> 15:13.621
It's going to town on mine.

15:13.704 --> 15:15.664
-Random chance? Who cares?
On my mark.
-I care.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.833
I say we wait for it
to destroy both of our uniforms.

15:17.916 --> 15:19.126
Mark!
(grunts)

15:20.085 --> 15:21.629
Jump, Boimler!

15:21.712 --> 15:23.005
Come on, it's safe.
It can't reach back this far.

15:23.088 --> 15:24.632
Man.
(grunts)

15:24.715 --> 15:25.966
Oh!

15:26.050 --> 15:27.968
Phaser it! Phaser it! Phaser it!

15:28.052 --> 15:30.387
Please don't phaser her.
It'll spoil the milk.

15:30.471 --> 15:31.972
Did you hear that?

15:32.056 --> 15:34.141
-Uh, I can't let it eat him.
-She's an herbivore.

15:34.224 --> 15:36.644
She's just gumming on him
to suckle out some moisture.

15:36.727 --> 15:39.021
Oh, okay.
Hey, Brad. Good news, buddy.

15:39.104 --> 15:41.940
So, I've ju-- it's just suckling
you, I've just learned.

15:42.024 --> 15:43.651
-You're fine.
-Help!

15:43.734 --> 15:45.402
Hang in there, you got this.
It is getting tired.

15:45.486 --> 15:47.529
So go to your happy place,
like, ooh,

15:47.613 --> 15:49.114
think about the warp core.

15:49.198 --> 15:50.658
(screaming)

15:50.741 --> 15:52.076
You, uh, want a snack
or something?

15:52.159 --> 15:54.370
Yeah, you got any of that milk?

15:54.453 --> 15:56.372
SHAXS:
All uninfected crew meet
at Transporter Room Eight.

15:56.455 --> 15:58.540
We have to get
to the rally point.

15:58.624 --> 16:01.168
I guess we better go for a walk.

16:04.254 --> 16:06.382
RUTHERFORD:
There's a maintenance hatch
on the other side of the saucer

16:06.465 --> 16:08.759
that should give us access
to Deck Eight. (clears throat)

16:08.842 --> 16:10.177
What kind of music are you into?

16:10.260 --> 16:11.720
We have just enough oxygen
to get there,

16:11.804 --> 16:13.389
but we're cutting it close.

16:13.472 --> 16:16.016
I really like this classical
band called The Monkees.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.393
Ever heard of 'em?

16:17.476 --> 16:18.727
Let's just say "I'm a Believer."

16:18.811 --> 16:19.895
(chuckles)

16:29.279 --> 16:31.448
(growling)

16:44.837 --> 16:46.839
(panting, laughing)

16:49.800 --> 16:52.594
Mmm. Wow. I wasn't
expecting that.

16:52.678 --> 16:53.929
What did you expect?

16:54.012 --> 16:55.139
Well, for these maintenance
hatch doors

16:55.222 --> 16:56.598
to recognize our combadges.

16:56.682 --> 16:59.727
Oh, no, I mean
what just happened?

16:59.810 --> 17:02.104
I'm more worried about
what didn't just happen.

17:02.187 --> 17:04.064
Failure analysis estimates
the reliability

17:04.148 --> 17:07.109
of this mechanism
at one out of 4.69 repeating.

17:07.192 --> 17:09.570
-(groans)
-Oh, are you seeing this?

17:09.653 --> 17:11.447
(grunting)

17:11.530 --> 17:13.115
-(pained cries)
-The anesthetic is useless.

17:13.198 --> 17:15.117
We have to work through
the pain. Your hands clean?

17:15.200 --> 17:17.619
-Uh...
-Pump this. Don't pass out.

17:17.703 --> 17:19.872
Nobody's authorized to pass out!

17:19.955 --> 17:22.124
That's my heart!
It hurts when you pump it!

17:22.207 --> 17:23.584
-Oh, God! Oh...
-Sorry.

17:23.667 --> 17:26.628
-Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
-Oh, God. Oh!

17:26.712 --> 17:28.714
(groaning, slurping)

17:34.011 --> 17:37.264
Okay, there we go, man, yeah.

17:37.347 --> 17:39.266
See? I told you it'd be okay.

17:39.349 --> 17:41.477
My bones.
(sobs)

17:41.560 --> 17:42.770
You'll be fine.
Doc'll wave a light over it.

17:42.853 --> 17:43.979
We got to get back to camp.

17:44.062 --> 17:45.105
You took way too long
with that thing.

17:45.189 --> 17:48.817
-But I'm naked.
-(sighs)

17:51.236 --> 17:53.697
At least we got
to help those guys.

17:53.781 --> 17:55.491
I think we make
a pretty good team, Boimler.

17:55.574 --> 17:57.993
You may as well know,
I've been monitoring you.

17:58.076 --> 17:59.244
I'm supposed to report
any breach of conduct

17:59.328 --> 18:00.788
to the captain.

18:00.871 --> 18:02.498
We've been serving together
for a year,

18:02.581 --> 18:04.208
and I still don't get
why you worship those guys.

18:04.291 --> 18:05.292
They're heroes.

18:05.375 --> 18:06.502
All they care about is glory.

18:06.585 --> 18:08.962
Stuff that could earn them
a mention in the history books.

18:09.046 --> 18:09.922
They don't really care about us.

18:10.005 --> 18:12.007
No way, no.
The captain tries her hardest

18:12.090 --> 18:14.134
to support all of us, she just
doesn't always have time to...

18:14.218 --> 18:15.177
Look, I don't have
to defend her.

18:15.260 --> 18:17.054
You're not gonna talk me out
of reporting you.

18:24.812 --> 18:26.980
