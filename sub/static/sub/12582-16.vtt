00:49.777 --> 00:52.405
Yep.

00:52.446 --> 00:54.073
Yep.

00:54.114 --> 00:55.809
Mm-hmm.

00:55.849 --> 00:58.647
Dale, what the heck
are you doing in my yard?

00:58.686 --> 01:00.176
Giving it peace of mind.

01:01.755 --> 01:05.982
"This is a bill for services
provided by... Daletech"?

01:06.026 --> 01:08.426
That's my home
security company.

01:08.462 --> 01:10.453
I've been providing
protection with my constant

01:10.497 --> 01:11.828
surveillance for years.

01:11.865 --> 01:14.527
Well, the free ride is over.

01:17.404 --> 01:18.928
Hey, Hank.

01:18.973 --> 01:20.600
Interested in lap dance?

01:20.641 --> 01:21.835
No, Kahn.

01:21.875 --> 01:24.105
I'm interested in you
putting a privacy hedge

01:24.144 --> 01:25.941
in front of your
bathroom window.

01:25.980 --> 01:27.242
We all have them.

01:27.281 --> 01:28.839
Hank made me plant two hedges.

01:28.882 --> 01:30.349
I agree.

01:30.384 --> 01:33.080
The ugly and working class
should have privacy hedges.

01:33.120 --> 01:35.520
But you don't keep
a Ferrari in the garage.

01:40.561 --> 01:42.153
Can Daletech do anything

01:42.196 --> 01:44.391
about getting me
a privacy hedge?

01:44.431 --> 01:46.194
To be honest, we're more into

01:46.233 --> 01:48.201
the invasion
of privacy business

01:48.235 --> 01:50.635
than the creation
of privacy business.

01:52.506 --> 01:54.371
Peggy, could you
hurry up with that toast?

01:54.408 --> 01:55.841
I want to get out of here

01:55.876 --> 01:58.367
before Kahn takes his shower.

01:58.412 --> 02:00.972
Bobby? Did you drink
my grape fruit juice?

02:01.015 --> 02:02.004
Yeah, sure, Dad.

02:02.049 --> 02:04.244
I drank your grape fruit juice.

02:04.284 --> 02:06.878
I had it with
a big bowl of broccoli.

02:07.955 --> 02:10.616
No, I didn't.

02:10.657 --> 02:12.057
Fine! Call your lawyer!

02:12.092 --> 02:14.686
Steak and eggs.
Bloody, but not raw.

02:14.728 --> 02:16.252
Grandpa!

02:16.296 --> 02:18.787
Where's Grandma Didi
and G. H?

02:18.832 --> 02:20.527
Gone to visit her folks.
I'm flopping here.

02:20.567 --> 02:22.797
Oh, that's great, Dad.
You can sleep in the...

02:22.836 --> 02:24.133
H-How long
will they be gone?

02:24.171 --> 02:25.900
Summer, part of autumn.
Don't know.

02:25.939 --> 02:28.032
Can't you stay
with anyone else?

02:28.075 --> 02:30.942
Your war buddies?
Stinky, Stanky, Smelly?

02:30.978 --> 02:33.276
They've all been shoved
into retirement homes.

02:33.313 --> 02:34.940
Got useless and got locked up.

02:34.982 --> 02:36.108
All except Topsy.

02:36.150 --> 02:38.516
Topsy? Perfect!
You guys could

02:38.552 --> 02:42.545
hang out at his place,
play checkers at his place.

02:42.589 --> 02:44.352
He's playing checkers
with worms.

02:44.391 --> 02:45.688
Died six months ago.

02:45.726 --> 02:46.920
Damn him.

02:46.960 --> 02:48.928
Hank, your wife
let the salt run out.

02:48.962 --> 02:50.862
Which one's the salt?

02:52.466 --> 02:55.663
Flour. Sugar.
Dog food.

02:55.703 --> 02:58.433
Sody pop.

02:59.773 --> 03:01.240
Look, Hank.

03:01.275 --> 03:03.140
I realize Cotton
is your father

03:03.177 --> 03:04.576
and you can't throw
him out on the street,

03:04.611 --> 03:07.375
but the man drives me nuts.

03:07.414 --> 03:09.314
We should send him
to senior daycare.

03:09.349 --> 03:11.249
They have daycare for seniors?

03:11.285 --> 03:12.582
It's the newest craze.

03:12.619 --> 03:15.520
Since life expectancy
has spiraled out of control,

03:15.556 --> 03:17.353
many nursery schools
are being converted

03:17.391 --> 03:18.790
to accommodate seniors.

03:18.826 --> 03:20.225
I'll pack him a sack lunch.

03:20.260 --> 03:22.353
I couldn't do that to my dad.

03:22.396 --> 03:23.624
He's just at loose ends.

03:29.036 --> 03:32.528
You just missed the criminals
who did this, Hank.

03:32.573 --> 03:35.098
Sure am glad
I'm protected by Daletech.

03:35.142 --> 03:36.837
Were they about
five-foot, ten,

03:36.877 --> 03:39.038
wearing a baseball cap
and about to get

03:39.079 --> 03:40.410
their ass kicked by me?

03:40.447 --> 03:44.144
- Um, it all happened so fast.
- I uh...

03:44.184 --> 03:46.948
Hey, Hank! Look! Propane!

03:48.655 --> 03:50.987
♪ It's a dead man's party ♪

03:51.024 --> 03:53.083
♪ Who could ask for more? ♪

03:53.127 --> 03:55.061
Look at this, Hank's wife.

03:55.095 --> 03:58.553
I've never seen a Far-Easterner
spend so much time primping.

03:58.599 --> 04:00.567
Not now, Cotton.
I'm busy.

04:00.601 --> 04:03.365
He got a half a bottle
of pomade in his hair.

04:03.403 --> 04:04.529
That man gets near a flame,

04:04.571 --> 04:06.334
he's going to look
like Chinese New Year.

04:08.509 --> 04:10.875
What ya doing?
Some kind of woman's work?

04:10.911 --> 04:12.276
Baking? Sewing?

04:12.312 --> 04:14.007
Which one is it?

04:14.047 --> 04:17.483
I am trying to make a crossword
puzzle for my Espanol class.

04:17.517 --> 04:19.747
- I need a four-letterword...
- Tent! Food! Ammo!

04:19.786 --> 04:20.947
Guns! Tojo!

04:20.988 --> 04:22.353
Horse! No, that's five.

04:22.389 --> 04:25.119
Cotton!
This is a Spanish crossword.

04:25.159 --> 04:26.854
Oh! Taco! Bean!

04:26.894 --> 04:29.192
Cuba! Peso! Agua!

04:29.229 --> 04:30.594
Hey, Hank!

04:30.631 --> 04:32.223
You forgot this!

04:33.867 --> 04:35.198
Mucho! Lucho!

04:35.235 --> 04:37.066
Grande! Enchilada!

04:38.472 --> 04:41.270
What ya doing?
Some kind of woman's work?

04:41.308 --> 04:43.242
Now all I need you
to do is staple

04:43.277 --> 04:44.904
the Char-King
warranty cards

04:44.945 --> 04:47.539
to the front
of the owner's manuals.

04:47.581 --> 04:49.071
Think you can
handle that, Dad?

04:49.116 --> 04:50.947
I made you, didn't I?

04:57.057 --> 04:59.719
So I sees you
in the market for a grill.

04:59.760 --> 05:01.057
Yes, sir.

05:01.094 --> 05:02.618
Do you know if this
model is self-cleaning?

05:02.663 --> 05:04.153
Like a cat.

05:04.198 --> 05:06.928
All you gots to do is, eh...

05:06.967 --> 05:08.525
push this red button.

05:15.342 --> 05:16.604
So, uh, Dad,

05:16.643 --> 05:18.634
I thought you might
enjoy this, uh,

05:18.679 --> 05:21.170
well, social club.

05:21.215 --> 05:23.877
You brought me to a brothel.

05:29.756 --> 05:31.314
Sorry about the murals,

05:31.358 --> 05:33.349
but we're still in transition.

05:33.393 --> 05:35.918
Don't matter to me, madam.

05:35.963 --> 05:38.488
Where can I transition
into my underpants?

05:38.532 --> 05:41.831
Aw, did you have an accident?

05:41.869 --> 05:44.167
You accept Blue Cross?

05:45.372 --> 05:46.999
What kind of brothel is this?

05:47.040 --> 05:48.564
It's an activity center.

05:48.609 --> 05:51.578
It'll be fun, Dad.
Just give it a chance.

05:51.612 --> 05:52.943
Bye!

05:59.319 --> 06:02.152
I'm not sleepy!

06:03.624 --> 06:04.420
Come on!

06:04.458 --> 06:05.925
You think I'm used up?

06:05.959 --> 06:09.395
I can outfight, out drink
and outdo anyone I know.

06:15.168 --> 06:19.036
Hmm. Double murder
in Detroit last night,

06:19.072 --> 06:22.371
wasn't protected by Daletech.

06:22.409 --> 06:23.501
Oh, God.

06:23.543 --> 06:24.737
What now?

06:24.778 --> 06:25.870
Hello, Officers.

06:25.913 --> 06:28.177
Uh, what kind of trouble
is my father in?

06:28.215 --> 06:29.614
Sir, he's not in any trouble

06:29.650 --> 06:32.118
now that we got him out
of that nursery school.

06:32.152 --> 06:33.449
A war hero like your dad

06:33.487 --> 06:35.455
still has a lot
to give to society.

06:35.489 --> 06:38.083
I'm an auxiliary policeman now.

06:38.125 --> 06:40.685
Sworn to serve and to protect.

06:40.727 --> 06:42.285
What? Really?

06:42.329 --> 06:43.660
With all the budget cuts,

06:43.697 --> 06:46.029
our manpower's been
stretched to its limits.

06:46.066 --> 06:48.506
That's why we started a senior
division of Citizens on Patrol.

06:48.535 --> 06:49.832
Officer Hill.

06:52.306 --> 06:53.864
Well, this is great, Dad.

06:53.907 --> 06:56.589
So what do you actually do?
You hang out at the station?

06:56.610 --> 06:59.204
Get the officers coffee?
Answer phones?

06:59.246 --> 07:01.441
Nope.
I gots myself a real beat.

07:01.481 --> 07:04.780
The cops said I'm the eyes
and ears of Rainy Street.

07:04.818 --> 07:07.685
But Daletech's the eyes
and ears of Rainy Street.

07:07.721 --> 07:09.018
Not anymore.

07:09.056 --> 07:11.183
Well, I think that's,
that's...

07:11.224 --> 07:12.452
You sassing me?
No!

07:13.994 --> 07:16.258
Too tight. Too tight!

07:20.267 --> 07:22.235
All right, I'm in charge

07:22.269 --> 07:23.930
of keeping the peace now.

07:23.971 --> 07:27.099
So if anyone thinks
I'm notworth the spit to shine a shoe,

07:27.140 --> 07:29.131
they better be ready
to talk to me

07:29.176 --> 07:30.905
and my partner,
Sgt. Whippy.

07:31.778 --> 07:32.938
Oh, that's great, Dad.

07:32.980 --> 07:34.572
But remember, you're supposed

07:34.614 --> 07:36.844
to be the eyes and ears
of the neighborhood,

07:36.883 --> 07:38.441
not the... whippy.

07:40.020 --> 07:41.510
Damn that Cotton.

07:41.555 --> 07:43.887
They'll never pay
for my Daletech service

07:43.924 --> 07:45.482
now that he's working for free.

07:46.727 --> 07:49.025
Nope, Cotton's got to go.

07:49.062 --> 07:51.826
But he's got Hank behind him
and Hank's the alpha-neighbor.

07:51.865 --> 07:54.800
I'm gamma or delta at best.

07:54.835 --> 07:57.633
Well, I didn't get
to be president of Daletech

07:57.671 --> 07:59.138
by playing by the rules.

07:59.172 --> 08:02.471
So Operation Turn Everyone
Against Cotton

08:02.509 --> 08:05.740
is in motion... now!

08:05.779 --> 08:07.144
Sounds good, Sug.

08:07.180 --> 08:09.475
Could you add the softener
when the washer dings?

08:09.515 --> 08:13.775
Oh, I'll add the
softener on the ding.

08:13.820 --> 08:14.946
<i>I don't know, Hank</i>.

08:14.988 --> 08:16.683
Cotton working as a cop?

08:16.723 --> 08:18.884
He has a terrible
human rights record.

08:18.925 --> 08:20.085
Don't worry.

08:20.127 --> 08:21.527
I checked
with the police department

08:21.528 --> 08:23.496
and he doesn't have
any actual police authority.

08:23.530 --> 08:26.829
Well, I'm off to chop down
that birdhouse.

08:26.867 --> 08:29.995
Too much chirping
disturbs the peace.

08:30.037 --> 08:32.835
Uh, Dad, I don't think
that's such a... dang it!

08:32.873 --> 08:35.171
Who moved this coffee table?

08:35.207 --> 08:37.039
First, my grapefruit
juice disappears.

08:37.077 --> 08:39.010
Now, someone's moving
the coffee table.

08:39.046 --> 08:42.015
Well, so you thinks someone
is breakin' in

08:42.049 --> 08:43.607
and messin' with
your stuff, do ya?

08:43.650 --> 08:46.278
No, Dad,
I'm sure it's nothing.

08:46.319 --> 08:48.549
Oh, well, I got
some choppin' to do.

08:48.588 --> 08:50.021
Hank's wife, we'll be having

08:50.057 --> 08:51.957
sparrow eggs for
breakfast tomorrow.

08:51.992 --> 08:55.155
But, uh, you know,
I'm not the police officer.

08:55.195 --> 08:56.287
You are.

08:56.329 --> 08:58.559
Would you be willing
to take on the case

08:58.598 --> 09:00.156
of who's drinking my juice

09:00.200 --> 09:02.168
and moving my coffee table?

09:02.202 --> 09:03.726
Hot berk, I'd better get on it!

09:05.138 --> 09:07.800
Cotton, that is an out door toy!

09:07.841 --> 09:09.365
Ten-four, Manimal!

09:12.379 --> 09:14.574
Hank, you can't really believe

09:14.614 --> 09:16.343
that someone's
breaking in our house

09:16.383 --> 09:18.112
just to drink
your grapefruit juice.

09:18.151 --> 09:20.346
No, but it'll keep him
busy a while,

09:20.387 --> 09:22.252
you know, out
of everyone's hair.

09:23.990 --> 09:25.787
Hello, boys.

09:25.826 --> 09:29.318
You off to play
a little marbles, mumbly peg

09:29.362 --> 09:31.057
or king of the coffee table?!

09:31.098 --> 09:35.159
We're gonna go shout
swear words into a sewer pipe.

09:35.202 --> 09:36.396
Not anymore!

09:36.436 --> 09:38.370
This street's on lockdown
till I find out

09:38.405 --> 09:39.895
who's been messing
with your daddy's stuff.

09:39.940 --> 09:40.907
Now move it!

09:45.679 --> 09:47.010
Good work, Officer.

09:47.047 --> 09:49.038
Those two looked like
some bad eggs all right.

09:49.082 --> 09:50.515
Can it, Gribble.

09:50.550 --> 09:54.111
Someone's been tapping
into my boy's grapefruit juice,

09:54.154 --> 09:56.054
and I means to find out who.

09:56.089 --> 09:57.381
Put your finger
down your throat.

09:57.424 --> 09:59.089
Let me see
what's in your gullet.

09:59.126 --> 10:01.253
Okay, but I'm allergic
to citrus.

10:01.294 --> 10:04.024
I wish I wasn't
'cause all Bill talks about

10:04.064 --> 10:06.123
is how good
grapefruit juice is.

10:06.166 --> 10:08.634
It's like he's rubbing it
in my face.

10:10.971 --> 10:12.370
Well, how do you like that?

10:12.405 --> 10:14.999
A man who doesn't like juice
has a juicer.

10:15.041 --> 10:17.202
Maybe I oughta squeeze
some truth out of you.

10:19.813 --> 10:21.644
It was a wedding gift!

10:23.483 --> 10:24.711
Dang it, wolfman!

10:24.751 --> 10:27.049
Your belly beard
done burned out the motor.

10:27.087 --> 10:28.554
I'm gonna get the Dirt Devil.

10:28.588 --> 10:30.317
Dale, you have to believe me.

10:30.357 --> 10:32.052
I didn't drink Hank's juice.

10:32.092 --> 10:34.083
I know you didn't, Bill.

10:34.127 --> 10:36.391
That power hungry
rent-a-cop

10:36.429 --> 10:38.021
is just out to make
a name for himself.

10:38.064 --> 10:39.895
I'm just as scared as you are.

10:39.933 --> 10:41.264
You got to help me.

10:41.301 --> 10:43.132
Well, you're not
a member of Daletech,

10:43.170 --> 10:45.730
but I guess I could try to
intervene just this once.

10:46.973 --> 10:48.406
Thank you, Daletech.

10:48.441 --> 10:50.375
Sir, you did it!

10:50.410 --> 10:54.039
Bill broke down and implicated
Boomhauer as the possible culprit.

10:54.080 --> 10:55.604
Ah! You don't say.

10:55.649 --> 11:00.279
Well, I guess I'd better
go pay Boomhauer a little visit.

11:05.158 --> 11:06.989
I'm not gonna ask ya again.

11:07.027 --> 11:09.655
Did ya drink
my boy's grapefruit juice?

11:09.696 --> 11:11.789
Got dang, man, I didn't drink
nothing, man.

11:11.831 --> 11:14.425
Talkin' bout just tryin'
to change my oil here, man.

11:15.268 --> 11:16.257
I like mangos, man!

11:16.303 --> 11:18.601
I believe ya.

11:18.638 --> 11:21.072
The weight of a jalopy

11:21.107 --> 11:23.166
always crushes the truth
out of a man.

11:25.845 --> 11:27.244
He called your car a jalopy.

11:27.280 --> 11:31.546
That is literally adding
insult to injury.

11:33.320 --> 11:35.254
Dang it!

11:35.288 --> 11:37.313
I don't know what kind of game

11:37.357 --> 11:39.416
is being played around here,

11:39.459 --> 11:41.825
but everybody in this house
knows

11:41.861 --> 11:45.024
the toilet paper goes over...
front, not...

11:45.065 --> 11:46.396
Don't look at me like that.

11:46.433 --> 11:48.094
You know what I'm talking about.

11:48.134 --> 11:50.568
You are as crazy as your father.

11:50.604 --> 11:52.196
You know what that
old coot did to Luanne?

11:52.239 --> 11:56.073
He cracked my driver's license
in half

11:56.109 --> 11:59.840
with a big snakey thing
because I didn't blinker.

11:59.879 --> 12:03.315
And he made me go to bed
at 3:30 in the afternoon.

12:03.350 --> 12:05.011
Look, I know Dad can be a pain,

12:05.051 --> 12:07.349
but I haven't seen this kind
of spark in him

12:07.387 --> 12:08.513
in a long time.

12:08.555 --> 12:11.285
Besides, Luanne never uses
her turn signal

12:11.324 --> 12:13.019
and Bobby gets cranky
around 4:00.

12:14.761 --> 12:18.253
Look, Hank Hill, I'm wearing
a bikini made of suds!

12:23.270 --> 12:25.067
Now, I understand
why lion tamers

12:25.105 --> 12:26.504
get mauled every so often.

12:30.143 --> 12:31.576
Boy, I gotta tell ya, Hank,

12:31.611 --> 12:33.203
things sure have gone to hell

12:33.246 --> 12:35.009
ever since Cotton
got that badge.

12:35.048 --> 12:38.074
Yeah, maybe
that's partly my fault.

12:38.118 --> 12:40.586
I guess I'd better have
a sit-down with him.

12:40.620 --> 12:43.589
Hmm, that might not be
a good idea.

12:43.623 --> 12:47.753
Cotton's self-esteem
is as fragile as his elderly hips.

12:47.794 --> 12:50.820
Hey, maybe we should have
a neighborhood meeting

12:50.864 --> 12:53.128
to let people
blow off some steam in private.

12:53.166 --> 12:55.634
You know, a bull session?

12:55.669 --> 12:57.068
That's not a bad idea, Dale.

12:57.103 --> 12:58.127
You're right.

12:58.171 --> 12:59.331
It's not a bad idea.

12:59.372 --> 13:01.340
Not a bad idea at all.

13:06.646 --> 13:08.443
It's the beer.

13:08.481 --> 13:09.880
I just want to start

13:09.916 --> 13:12.009
this meeting off
by acknowledging

13:12.052 --> 13:14.612
that my Dad can be
a handful sometimes.

13:14.654 --> 13:16.417
A handful of crap!

13:17.524 --> 13:19.788
I thought we were
supposed to vent.

13:21.027 --> 13:21.994
Go ahead.

13:22.028 --> 13:23.086
It's a safe environment.

13:23.129 --> 13:25.620
What's said here, stays here.

13:25.665 --> 13:27.997
He pulled my belly hairs
with a juicer!

13:28.034 --> 13:32.300
It took me 16 years to get
my first driver's license.

13:32.339 --> 13:34.432
I'm too old to start over!

13:34.474 --> 13:38.240
He keeps on pressing me
to name Connie as a Communist.

13:38.278 --> 13:39.438
I had to!

13:42.282 --> 13:43.806
You were right, Gribble.

13:43.850 --> 13:46.114
They are all plotting
against me.

13:46.152 --> 13:48.916
We should rub grapefruitjuice
in his eye.

13:48.955 --> 13:50.582
And slap him on a bus

13:50.623 --> 13:52.614
with a sack lunch!

13:53.760 --> 13:54.954
All right!

13:54.994 --> 13:56.484
I'm arresting everybody here

13:56.529 --> 13:58.793
for conspiring to slander
a police officer.

13:58.832 --> 14:00.857
What? Dad, that's crazy.

14:00.900 --> 14:02.026
And you...

14:02.068 --> 14:04.161
All that stuff you claim's
been messed with...

14:04.204 --> 14:06.195
How do I know
it ain't an inside job?

14:06.239 --> 14:08.230
Maybe ya done it
for the insurance money.

14:08.274 --> 14:11.539
You think I insure my juice
against being drunk?

14:13.313 --> 14:14.109
Shush it!

14:14.147 --> 14:15.273
You're all suspects.

14:15.315 --> 14:16.839
Now, if you cuff yourselves

14:16.883 --> 14:18.316
it'll save ya a beatin'.

14:18.351 --> 14:20.444
Start cuffin'!

14:21.588 --> 14:22.714
No, don't hurt me?

14:24.824 --> 14:27.190
Give me my whip, boy.

14:27.227 --> 14:28.387
No.

14:28.428 --> 14:29.828
Dang it, Dad,
you're out of control.

14:29.863 --> 14:31.330
There is no mystery.

14:31.364 --> 14:33.764
I just gave you that
as busy work,

14:33.800 --> 14:35.324
but you even managed
to screw that up.

14:35.368 --> 14:36.562
But I'm a cop.

14:36.603 --> 14:37.900
I keeps the peace.

14:37.937 --> 14:40.770
I'm protecting the... juice.

14:40.807 --> 14:43.332
Someone moves the table, I...

14:43.376 --> 14:45.071
Dad, you're not a cop.

14:45.111 --> 14:46.271
Now give me your badge.

14:46.312 --> 14:48.143
I don't want to have
to call the real police.

15:03.863 --> 15:06.627
Daletech, for all
your home security needs.

15:06.666 --> 15:09.829
Daletech, for all your home
security needs.

15:14.474 --> 15:17.910
So, who wants the
new introductory surveillance package?

15:17.944 --> 15:19.912
For an extra 30 bucks a month,

15:19.946 --> 15:23.211
you'll get a closed circuit
feed of Bill's house.

15:23.249 --> 15:26.082
It puts it all
in perspective, believe me.

15:26.119 --> 15:27.586
I believe you.

15:27.620 --> 15:29.588
So where is Cotton?
Let me guess.

15:29.622 --> 15:32.591
Did he get busted down to doing
cross-guard duty?

15:32.625 --> 15:36.823
No. He's making macaroni art
down at the Sunset Day Center.

15:36.863 --> 15:38.797
Really? He's back in graycare?

15:38.832 --> 15:41.733
I thought he had more fight
in him than that.

15:41.768 --> 15:45.329
No. Losing that badge seemed
to really take it out of him.

15:45.371 --> 15:47.271
Well, I better go pick him up.

15:48.842 --> 15:52.175
Well, maybe I'll come along
and bring the colonel a balloon.

15:52.212 --> 15:53.645
Not as a potential client.

15:53.680 --> 15:55.011
Just as a guy, you know,

15:55.048 --> 15:56.879
who's down and could...

15:56.916 --> 15:58.508
could use a balloon.

15:58.551 --> 16:00.951
Hey, Peeping Tom!

16:00.987 --> 16:03.148
After speed walk,
I take shower.

16:03.189 --> 16:04.850
See you in half an hour.

16:06.125 --> 16:08.059
No hedge!

16:21.007 --> 16:23.100
I see you painted a picture.

16:23.142 --> 16:25.542
This must be a
symbolic painting

16:25.578 --> 16:27.307
of how he feels inside.

16:27.347 --> 16:30.441
Is this how you feel inside?

16:30.483 --> 16:31.950
Sorta.

16:31.985 --> 16:34.146
Yup. See? That's
you, Hank, yelling,

16:34.187 --> 16:36.747
and embarrassing him
in front of everyone.

16:36.789 --> 16:38.086
Ooh! There's me!

16:40.493 --> 16:41.960
Come on, Dad.

16:41.995 --> 16:44.122
You can finish that tomorrow.

16:50.770 --> 16:53.637
Hey, Dad, want
to grab a beer in the alley?

16:53.673 --> 16:56.801
No. I'm just gonna go to bed.

16:56.843 --> 17:00.802
I need to get up early
and find three aerosol can tops

17:00.847 --> 17:02.747
for my craft project.

17:02.782 --> 17:05.012
Boy, I hate to see
your dad like this.

17:05.050 --> 17:06.848
Why don't I just
look after him

17:06.886 --> 17:09.650
so he doesn't have
to go back to that place tomorrow?

17:09.689 --> 17:11.247
You'd do that?

17:11.290 --> 17:12.758
Sure. Daletech's a bust.

17:12.791 --> 17:14.987
Guess it's the wrong
economic climate

17:15.028 --> 17:17.791
to be an expensive,
poorly trained visionary.

17:22.234 --> 17:26.137
You really shouldn't
feel so worthless.

17:26.172 --> 17:28.106
I'm much more
of a burden on my family,

17:28.141 --> 17:29.608
and I feel great.

17:29.642 --> 17:32.338
The show's over.

17:33.746 --> 17:36.772
I can't stand to see
you like this, sir.

17:36.816 --> 17:38.443
I'm the one who broke you,

17:38.484 --> 17:40.452
so I'm going to fix this.

17:41.921 --> 17:43.013
Hey, did you ever see

17:43.056 --> 17:44.887
<i>One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest?</i>

17:44.924 --> 17:45.856
You're

17:45.892 --> 17:47.450
Jack Nicholson.

17:47.493 --> 17:49.723
Are you crazy?!

17:49.762 --> 17:52.094
This might be easier
if you lie down.

17:53.833 --> 17:57.291
Now you're showing
some life? Geez!

17:57.337 --> 17:59.305
This kind of
complicates things.

18:00.673 --> 18:02.072
Wait!

18:04.911 --> 18:06.378
I know that smell!

18:06.412 --> 18:08.642
Someone has been monkeying
around in my boy's house!

18:08.681 --> 18:09.978
And I know who it is!

18:10.016 --> 18:11.506
Good for you, sir!

18:11.551 --> 18:14.384
Hot berk,
I'm not some old screwup!

18:14.420 --> 18:16.820
Now all I need is some proof.

18:16.856 --> 18:19.222
Gribble, I'm hiring Daletech!

18:21.461 --> 18:23.224
Oh, no!

18:23.262 --> 18:25.924
I've soiled myself!

18:25.965 --> 18:27.592
It's okay, sir!

18:27.634 --> 18:30.933
They'll change you at
the Sunset Day Center,

18:30.970 --> 18:33.268
where we will be all day!

18:43.650 --> 18:45.277
The trap has been set.

18:45.318 --> 18:47.946
Now the waiting begins.

18:50.823 --> 18:53.951
God, the waiting is
interminable, isn't it?

18:58.064 --> 19:00.726
Hello, Mr. Kahn.

19:02.268 --> 19:04.793
I don't know what
you are talking about.

19:04.837 --> 19:08.739
You think I drink juice and
move hillbilly furniture around?

19:08.775 --> 19:10.242
I know you did.

19:10.276 --> 19:11.937
Nobody in my boy's house,

19:11.978 --> 19:14.412
or even this neighborhood,
uses pomade.

19:14.447 --> 19:16.074
I can smell it on you,

19:16.115 --> 19:17.742
and I can smell it
on this pillow.

19:17.784 --> 19:19.581
Now, confess.

19:19.619 --> 19:20.779
You have no proof.

19:20.820 --> 19:22.219
Who gonna believe you?

19:22.255 --> 19:24.086
You just some crazy old man.

19:24.123 --> 19:25.590
Oh, yeah?

19:27.493 --> 19:29.586
Hello?

19:29.629 --> 19:31.096
Coast clear.

19:34.801 --> 19:36.428
Hey, slow down.

19:36.469 --> 19:39.927
That juice expensive for
poor hillbillies like us.

19:39.972 --> 19:41.940
Oh, you right.

19:41.974 --> 19:44.238
I shouldn't have done that.

19:44.277 --> 19:47.303
I'm a very bad
redneck, Peggy Hill.

19:47.346 --> 19:48.608
Okay, you caught me.

19:48.648 --> 19:49.945
I drink Hank's juice.

19:49.982 --> 19:51.279
Let's call it a day.

19:51.317 --> 19:53.285
Hey, you...

19:53.319 --> 19:55.879
Mmm! Maybe I teach you a lesson.

19:55.922 --> 19:58.015
After all, I'm always blabbing

19:58.057 --> 20:00.116
about being
a substitute teacher.

20:00.159 --> 20:01.751
Does Hank Hill know about this?

20:01.794 --> 20:03.989
If he did, you
wouldn't be alive.

20:04.030 --> 20:09.900
You look as sexy to me as
propane tank, I tell you what.

20:09.936 --> 20:11.665
I promise never to do it again.

20:11.704 --> 20:13.604
We go back
to library reading room

20:13.639 --> 20:14.765
if we need cheap thrill.

20:14.807 --> 20:16.604
Please don't tell Hank Hill.

20:16.642 --> 20:18.132
I give you anything you want.

20:18.177 --> 20:21.977
I don't need anything from you,
but my boy does.

20:22.014 --> 20:24.346
I want you to give
him his privacy hedge.

20:24.383 --> 20:26.749
You're gonna pay for it,
you're gonna build it,

20:26.786 --> 20:29.152
and you're going
to thank him for the privilege.

20:29.188 --> 20:30.485
And you have to subscribe

20:30.523 --> 20:32.991
to a year
of Daletech services.

20:33.025 --> 20:36.256
Dah! Okay. Hey,
this tape pretty good.

20:36.295 --> 20:37.762
Can I keep it?

20:40.900 --> 20:43.494
Huh! I didn't even
know there was a case,

20:43.536 --> 20:45.003
and you solved it.

20:45.037 --> 20:46.834
Who would have
guessed it was Kahn?

20:46.873 --> 20:47.999
I didn't guess, boy.

20:48.040 --> 20:49.974
I did some
old-fashioned police work.

20:50.009 --> 20:52.842
Well, however you
did it, good job.

20:52.879 --> 20:55.439
Officer Hill,
Rainey Street thanks you.

20:56.816 --> 20:59.546
You impersonating an officer,
boy?

20:59.585 --> 21:01.280
Put that hand down.

21:04.322 --> 21:06.622
I still don't
see what's so funny

21:06.658 --> 21:09.724
about you sneaking in my house
just to move stuff around.

21:09.762 --> 21:12.130
Oh, yeah, it real
funny in Laos.

21:12.165 --> 21:14.656
