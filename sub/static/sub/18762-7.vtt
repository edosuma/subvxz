_

00:04.455 --> 00:07.089
_

00:07.191 --> 00:08.957
Come on, this way.

00:10.461 --> 00:12.461
Clear the room.

00:15.332 --> 00:16.671
All clear, nobody's here.

00:18.502 --> 00:20.135
It sounds like it got quiet out there.

00:20.220 --> 00:21.011
Yeah.

00:21.672 --> 00:23.805
Shit! Frank! There's somebody here.

00:25.175 --> 00:26.725
Is anybody here?

00:26.844 --> 00:29.061
Speak up... we will shoot.

00:31.160 --> 00:33.682
Wait, hold your fire, Frank!
It's just a kid.

00:33.817 --> 00:35.233
Hey, boy.

00:35.352 --> 00:36.902
Is that water for us?

00:40.491 --> 00:43.859
Jesus Christ, Frank,
you just killed a kid!

00:44.240 --> 00:45.155
Eh.

00:46.363 --> 00:47.746
Jesus Christ!

00:47.865 --> 00:49.164
Oh, my God.

00:49.249 --> 00:50.749
I'm gonna give him CPR.

00:55.706 --> 00:57.706
Now, is he blowing someone?
What is happening?

00:57.841 --> 00:59.374
- Yeah, looks like it.
- Jesus Christ,

00:59.510 --> 01:00.759
Frank, he was just trying
to give us water, man!

01:00.878 --> 01:02.127
Forget it, he's dead.

01:02.212 --> 01:03.671
You can't go around killing kids!

01:03.681 --> 01:04.879
Think about his mom and his dad.

01:05.016 --> 01:05.965
How long they been playing this for?

01:06.050 --> 01:06.966
Oh, dude...

01:07.051 --> 01:07.967
three straight days.

01:08.052 --> 01:09.185
They've been playing this

01:09.270 --> 01:10.219
- for three days?
- Yeah, absolutely.

01:10.354 --> 01:11.804
Jesus Christ, have they slept?

01:11.889 --> 01:13.639
No. No, they've just been
wandering around the bar,

01:13.724 --> 01:15.474
blowing kids, doing whatever
they're doing, you know?

01:15.560 --> 01:17.276
- Frank, behind you!
- Is this where we're headed?

01:17.395 --> 01:18.394
I mean, as a world? Know what I mean...

01:18.529 --> 01:19.645
as a society?

01:19.730 --> 01:22.531
Hey, uh, have any of you
seen my guy yet?

01:22.617 --> 01:23.555
Oh, what is this, now?

01:23.556 --> 01:24.356
- What? Who?
- Huh?

01:24.402 --> 01:25.651
- What do you want to tell us? Just tell us.
- Oh, I just

01:25.736 --> 01:27.319
totally hooked up with this super hot

01:27.405 --> 01:29.538
stripper soldier last night.
He's swinging by.

01:29.624 --> 01:30.706
- Oh, you're dating a stripper.
- Mm-hmm.

01:30.791 --> 01:31.707
Wow, gross.

01:31.792 --> 01:33.409
Gross? If you guys started

01:33.544 --> 01:34.877
dating a stripper you'd
be bragging about it

01:34.962 --> 01:36.712
for days. I meet myself a Channing Tatum

01:36.797 --> 01:38.831
and suddenly it's gross?

01:38.916 --> 01:39.999
A what... a charming taint man?

01:40.084 --> 01:41.750
What words is she trying to say?

01:41.886 --> 01:44.003
- Uh, she's talking about Channing Tatum.
- Oh.

01:44.088 --> 01:45.171
- He's an actor.
- What do I know him in?

01:45.256 --> 01:46.972
- Well, he-he plays G.I. Joe.
- Oh!

01:47.091 --> 01:49.141
- G.I... Oh, G.I. Joe's the shit.
- G.I. Joe. - Yeah, yeah.

01:49.260 --> 01:50.976
- Well, then say G.I. Joe, don't make up a name.
- All right, you know what,

01:51.095 --> 01:52.344
whatever. It doesn't matter. Anyway,

01:52.430 --> 01:54.145
we had this really amazing connection

01:54.428 --> 01:55.877
and the sex was so meaningful,

01:55.963 --> 01:57.212
both of us wept tears of joy.

01:57.297 --> 01:59.514
- Makes me want to throw up.
- Yeah.

01:59.633 --> 02:00.549
- Just what happened.
- You know what I think is happening

02:00.634 --> 02:01.883
right now? I think the guy's

02:01.969 --> 02:03.435
coming by because you stole his watch.

02:03.520 --> 02:04.603
Oh, right, you jacked
his wallet or something

02:04.688 --> 02:06.354
so he'd come over and you-you...

02:06.473 --> 02:08.690
- Yeah.
- Right? Just to get him to talk to you again.

02:08.809 --> 02:10.142
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:10.276 --> 02:11.911
- Hello. Hey.
- Hey, Mike.

02:12.146 --> 02:13.395
Hey. Thanks for calling me.

02:13.481 --> 02:15.981
- Yeah. Thanks for coming by.
- So you have my watch?

02:17.318 --> 02:19.285
- Oh...
- Yeah. Just diving

02:19.370 --> 02:20.703
straight into that, huh?

02:20.821 --> 02:23.455
Listen, um, I'm really glad
you called, though.

02:23.541 --> 02:25.207
I really wanted to thank
you for last night.

02:25.326 --> 02:26.825
Thank <i> you</i> for last night.

02:26.961 --> 02:28.160
Yeah. It's like, we were

02:28.296 --> 02:29.328
having sex and the whole time

02:29.463 --> 02:30.329
- Yeah.
- I was like,

02:30.464 --> 02:31.830
"What's become of me?"

02:31.966 --> 02:34.300
You know,
all I do is I strip all night, I play

02:34.385 --> 02:36.502
video games all day,
I have meaningless sex

02:36.637 --> 02:37.636
with strangers.

02:37.722 --> 02:38.721
My own daughter won't even

02:38.839 --> 02:39.888
talk to me, you know? So I was

02:40.007 --> 02:41.890
like... "Damn."

02:42.009 --> 02:43.892
And I realized I hit rock bottom.

02:44.979 --> 02:46.011
Oh.

02:46.147 --> 02:47.563
And that's why I was crying.

02:47.682 --> 02:49.815
Oh. Right, yeah.

02:49.900 --> 02:51.900
- Yeah.
- Yeah. But don't-don't take it personally.

02:52.019 --> 02:53.435
No. Because it... Why would it be?

02:53.521 --> 02:54.937
- All right, cool.
- It's...

02:55.022 --> 02:56.522
- Yeah, cool.
- Cool, 'cause it really

02:56.657 --> 02:58.991
helped me realize that I got
to give that lifestyle up.

02:59.076 --> 02:59.992
- Oh...
- So thank you.

03:00.077 --> 03:01.493
You're welcome.

03:01.579 --> 03:04.330
Um... I don't remember your name.

03:06.751 --> 03:07.916
Dee.

03:08.035 --> 03:09.501
Dee?

03:09.587 --> 03:11.453
- Yeah.
- Cool.

03:11.539 --> 03:14.540
Now, can I get that watch, or...

03:14.675 --> 03:16.292
- Hey, Dee, I think he just wants his watch.
- I think he needs his...

03:16.377 --> 03:17.343
- Yeah, I understand.
- Yeah.

03:17.428 --> 03:18.344
Oh, yeah, yeah.

Rock bottom? Me?
Uh, hey, buddy, how about when

03:43.492 --> 03:44.658
your daughter stopped talking to you...

03:44.777 --> 03:46.076
Maybe that was your rock bottom, okay?

03:46.161 --> 03:47.327
I'm not rock bottom.

03:47.446 --> 03:49.279
You know what I am? I'm a rock.

03:49.415 --> 03:51.582
Dee is a rock.
In fact, I'm the type of gal

03:51.667 --> 03:53.485
who makes men's lives better.

03:53.619 --> 03:56.203
Hey-o! You guys mind if I shower
in that leaky urinal again?

03:58.841 --> 03:59.840
Well, that... Don't count that.

03:59.959 --> 04:01.091
That's not a good example.

04:01.176 --> 04:04.044
No, I got... I got to do something
about this, goddamn it.

04:04.129 --> 04:05.679
I am gonna fix this problem,
'cause I'm gonna

04:05.798 --> 04:06.964
tell you something right now:

04:07.099 --> 04:09.800
Sweet Dee is a rock.

04:09.935 --> 04:11.552
Goddamn it, Frank, you shot a woman.

04:11.637 --> 04:13.353
- Who cares?
- Jesus Christ, man,

04:13.472 --> 04:15.689
- I got to stop. This is too real.
- What, what?

04:15.808 --> 04:17.140
I got to take a break, dude.

04:17.690 --> 04:18.725
It's driving me insane.

04:18.810 --> 04:20.861
Come on, how are we gonna
win if you keep quitting?

04:20.980 --> 04:22.195
I don't care!

04:22.314 --> 04:23.614
- Lot of storm-outs today, huh?
- Yeah.

04:23.699 --> 04:25.482
- Yeah. Yeah.
- This is pathetic.

04:25.618 --> 04:26.783
Dee can't handle a little rejection.

04:26.869 --> 04:29.119
Mac's banged up
over a goddamn video game.

04:29.204 --> 04:30.203
- Yeah.
- It's...

04:30.322 --> 04:32.039
stripper guy is traumatized

04:32.157 --> 04:33.991
because he gets to take his clothes off

04:34.126 --> 04:35.742
in front of a bunch of horny ladies.

04:35.828 --> 04:38.161
- Yeah.
- And then he has sex with one disgusting bird.

04:38.297 --> 04:39.546
- Yeah.
- Come on, man,

04:39.665 --> 04:41.415
- that's not trauma. That's not real trauma.
- Nah. It's not even

04:41.500 --> 04:42.966
- that bad.
- I mean, if... if anything,

04:43.052 --> 04:43.967
that's insulting to people

04:44.053 --> 04:45.052
- who have experienced real trauma.
- Yeah.

04:45.170 --> 04:46.053
- I think it is. Yeah.
- I mean, like

04:46.171 --> 04:47.421
you, for instance.

04:47.506 --> 04:48.922
Uh, me?

04:49.008 --> 04:50.173
Well, yeah. Sure, man.

04:50.309 --> 04:51.308
I mean, you grew up fatherless.

04:51.393 --> 04:53.894
You were raised by a woman
who was basically a prostitute.

04:54.013 --> 04:55.145
Well, the father stuff was real.

04:55.230 --> 04:56.146
Yeah, without a doubt.

04:56.231 --> 04:57.147
Got some daddy issues there.

04:57.232 --> 04:58.265
And-and you, too. I mean,

04:58.350 --> 04:59.816
like, you know,
what happened with you...

04:59.902 --> 05:01.768
with Ms. Klinsky, the librarian.
I mean, you were raped.

05:01.854 --> 05:03.353
- Ah. No. St...
- And tha-that's got to affect you.

05:03.489 --> 05:04.287
- That's trauma.
- Will you stop?

05:04.323 --> 05:06.440
Why do you guys br... no.
That wasn't a rape, okay?

05:06.525 --> 05:07.991
- It was.
- That was a mutual... No, stop. Like...

05:08.077 --> 05:09.610
She's an older woman,
you were a younger...

05:09.695 --> 05:11.078
A woman can't rape a guy.

05:11.196 --> 05:12.863
- An older woman can rape a younger...
- It's not...

05:12.998 --> 05:14.164
- Doesn't matter. That's not the point.
- Oh, yeah. Right, right.

05:14.249 --> 05:15.165
- This is separate, yeah.
- Look, it's...

05:15.250 --> 05:16.333
It's not the point. The point is,

05:16.418 --> 05:18.168
yeah, fine, I'll do it.

05:19.348 --> 05:20.253
You'll do what?

05:20.372 --> 05:21.838
I'll strip. Yeah.

05:21.924 --> 05:24.124
Huh. I didn't realize you
were talking about that.

05:24.209 --> 05:25.175
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:25.260 --> 05:26.209
- Huh.
- You know,

05:26.345 --> 05:28.345
if this Mike fella wants to walk away

05:28.430 --> 05:30.130
from an amazing stripping career,

05:30.215 --> 05:31.715
hey, I'll take up that mantle.

05:31.850 --> 05:33.133
You know, frankly,
I'm a little disappointed

05:33.218 --> 05:34.635
in myself for not thinking of it before.

05:34.720 --> 05:35.886
You know? It just makes sense.

05:36.021 --> 05:36.887
Right, yeah.

05:36.922 --> 05:38.939
Here's the thing, man.
I can't do it without you.

05:39.058 --> 05:40.057
I need you to get my back.

05:40.192 --> 05:42.309
Oh, uh, you want me to strip with you?

05:42.394 --> 05:43.894
Oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no.

05:44.029 --> 05:45.445
I-I-I... no, I just literally

05:45.564 --> 05:46.563
need you to have a look at my back,
you know,

05:46.699 --> 05:47.698
make sure there's no moles

05:47.783 --> 05:48.782
or, like, unsightly hairs,

05:48.901 --> 05:49.783
bumps, zits, you know,

05:49.902 --> 05:50.784
- that kind of thing.
- Ah, yeah...

05:50.903 --> 05:51.785
And then, you know, get after it.

05:51.904 --> 05:52.953
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll clean you up.

05:53.072 --> 05:53.987
All right, all right, I can do that.

05:54.073 --> 05:55.288
- Cool.
- Cool, man. You be my boy?

05:55.407 --> 05:56.657
Yeah, I'll be the boy.

05:56.742 --> 05:58.458
Well, just be my... L-like my bag boy.

05:58.577 --> 06:00.160
You know, carry around my-my lotions,

06:00.245 --> 06:01.995
my oils, my scents, my razors.

06:02.081 --> 06:03.213
Cool, man. Chill, chill.

06:03.298 --> 06:04.581
Yeah, that's cool, right?

06:04.717 --> 06:06.283
- Yeah, that's cool, bro. Cool.
- Cool.

06:06.483 --> 06:08.024
_

06:08.487 --> 06:09.720
Frank, where are you, man?

06:09.805 --> 06:10.804
I can't see.

06:11.890 --> 06:13.256
Jesus Christ.

06:14.393 --> 06:17.227
Oh, who's there?! Oh...

06:17.312 --> 06:18.679
Hey, boy.

06:18.764 --> 06:19.846
How you doing, man?

06:24.269 --> 06:26.403
No! Baba!

06:26.483 --> 06:27.418
_

06:27.656 --> 06:28.572
Mother!

06:28.657 --> 06:30.023
Oh, shit!

06:30.109 --> 06:31.241
Oh, no, man!

06:31.326 --> 06:32.325
I'm so sorry, man.

06:34.139 --> 06:36.279
Hey, son.

06:36.415 --> 06:38.415
Dad?! What are you doing here?

06:38.500 --> 06:39.533
How did you get in the game?

06:39.618 --> 06:41.118
Guess we...

06:41.253 --> 06:43.253
won't be having that catch

06:43.338 --> 06:44.871
after all.

06:44.957 --> 06:46.339
You were gonna have a catch with me?

06:46.458 --> 06:48.292
I was, but...

06:50.846 --> 06:52.796
you killed me, son.

06:53.966 --> 06:56.299
I... love...

06:57.889 --> 07:00.137
Wa-Wa... Wait! Wait, Dad!
Who do you love?

07:00.272 --> 07:01.972
Dad, who do you love? Wait.

07:02.107 --> 07:05.392
Dad, who do you love? No, Dad! No!

07:09.474 --> 07:10.864
What the hell?

07:10.983 --> 07:13.116
Oh, was that a dream?

07:13.202 --> 07:14.785
Dennis?

07:14.870 --> 07:17.154
Oh, my God, man,
I just had the weirdest dream.

08:07.617 --> 08:08.588
- What?
- Frank.

08:08.707 --> 08:11.291
Look, I-I... I can't sleep.
I'm having nightmares.

08:11.376 --> 08:13.176
- Dead kids, dads.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Mac.

08:13.262 --> 08:14.795
Slow down. What are you saying?

08:14.880 --> 08:16.379
I got to quit the game, dude. I can't

08:16.515 --> 08:17.798
- do this anymore.
- No, no, no.

08:17.883 --> 08:19.466
Don't quit just yet.

08:19.551 --> 08:22.102
- Look, have a drink and calm down.
- Okay, fine.

08:22.525 --> 08:24.721
I'll calm down. I'll-I'll
drink some whiskey or something.

08:24.857 --> 08:26.723
Yeah, stuff it down with brown.

08:26.859 --> 08:28.775
That's the best way to deal with things.

08:28.894 --> 08:30.310
Okay.

08:32.110 --> 08:32.895
Kid's a mess.

08:36.301 --> 08:38.160
Goddamn it, Charlie,
we're 30 minutes late, man.

08:38.246 --> 08:40.446
I'm so sorry I cut your
back so many times, man.

08:40.556 --> 08:42.048
- What happened?
- I was nervous, dude.

08:42.123 --> 08:44.540
- Why?
- I've never, like, cut such a muscular back.

08:44.659 --> 08:46.659
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah. Oh, dude, your back looks great, man.

08:46.795 --> 08:48.086
I'm working hard, dude.

08:48.087 --> 08:49.287
Dude, you're putting the work in,
and it's showing, man.

08:49.331 --> 08:51.464
- Thank you so much, man. I really appreciate that.
- Yeah, right, right, right, right.

08:51.309 --> 08:53.064
But just let's not
talk about it in there.

08:53.065 --> 08:53.865
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Don't bring it up.

08:53.895 --> 08:55.478
Can you walk me through
what your guy is again?

08:55.597 --> 08:57.097
Okay, so here's the deal, man.

08:57.232 --> 08:58.732
Who do girls want to have sex
with more than anybody else?

08:58.817 --> 09:00.767
- Jugglers.
- Jug...?

09:00.902 --> 09:02.686
- Dudes who can, like, juggle things.
- I know what a juggler is.

09:02.771 --> 09:03.937
- You know, with the fire sticks and the balls.
- Yeah.

09:04.072 --> 09:05.655
No, they don't want to
have sex with a juggler.

09:05.774 --> 09:07.657
They want to have sex with their dads.

09:08.488 --> 09:11.327
- Weird.
- Yeah, it is weird, so I'm a dad.

09:11.433 --> 09:13.349
Oh. Okay, cool. Oh, and I'm your boy.

09:13.435 --> 09:16.936
- All right, that works.
- Well, no. What? Why would you be my boy?

09:17.072 --> 09:19.261
Oh, you said I was gonna be your boy
'cause I have daddy trauma,

09:19.296 --> 09:21.092
and then, I didn't realize
I was gonna be your boy

09:21.127 --> 09:21.908
in there, but that works great.

09:21.993 --> 09:23.326
No, that doesn't make any sense.

09:23.445 --> 09:24.694
How would you be my s...?

09:24.779 --> 09:26.790
I'm their dad.
How could I also be your dad?

09:26.825 --> 09:29.365
We can't all be related. Christ, Charlie,
you're not making any sense, man.

09:29.451 --> 09:31.667
Yeah, I mean,
you could have a lot of kids, I guess.

09:31.786 --> 09:33.703
I got to say, though,
I'm looking inside there,

09:33.788 --> 09:35.038
and this isn't making sense to me.

09:35.123 --> 09:36.672
I mean, these are all older women.
Might be

09:36.791 --> 09:38.791
a little bit hard for me to
pull off the dad thing at all.

09:38.927 --> 09:39.897
- That's not a good play.
- You know,

09:39.898 --> 09:41.393
I'm getting a bad feeling
about this, man.

09:41.428 --> 09:43.096
Hey, man, do you think
maybe that's 'cause

09:43.181 --> 09:45.798
- of your librarian trauma?
- You're talking about Ms. Klinsky?

09:45.934 --> 09:47.517
- Yeah, she was an older woman, and...
- What? No. There was...

09:47.635 --> 09:49.769
Let's not talk...
Can we stop talking about trauma

09:49.854 --> 09:51.721
- and-and-and cuts on the... on peoples' backs?
- Yes.

09:51.806 --> 09:53.306
And let's... It's not sexy, okay?

09:53.441 --> 09:54.891
- Okay, yeah, well, then let's split.
- Okay.

09:54.976 --> 09:56.726
- All right, let's go.
- All right, man.

09:57.306 --> 09:58.611
Are you the stripper?

09:58.696 --> 10:00.426
- Oh, uh, yeah, that's him.
- Uh...

10:00.615 --> 10:02.398
- What, are you 40?
- Yup.

10:02.484 --> 10:04.067
Fine. You guys'll do, I guess.

10:04.152 --> 10:06.402
Y-You guys? No. Sorry. I'm just the boy.

10:06.488 --> 10:08.321
- The what? - Just...
- Sorry. I'm-I'm <i> his</i> boy.

10:08.456 --> 10:10.474
Well, you're not my boy.
He's not...

10:10.825 --> 10:13.493
Are you gonna stand out here
and talk like little bitches,

10:13.628 --> 10:17.130
or are you gonna come inside and
take your dicks out for money?

10:19.182 --> 10:20.249
Daddy?

10:21.373 --> 10:23.219
Just don't call me Daddy.

10:24.228 --> 10:25.951
<i>Yeah, my generation...</i>

10:26.080 --> 10:28.113
we drank our problems away.

10:28.199 --> 10:31.333
But since you softies like
to talk about everything,

10:31.418 --> 10:33.309
I figured this was a good thing to do.

10:33.321 --> 10:35.271
A PTSD support group, Frank?

10:35.406 --> 10:37.240
Yeah, yeah. Maybe you'll get some help,

10:37.325 --> 10:39.942
- we can finish the damn game.
- What's up, dicks?

10:40.078 --> 10:41.661
What the hell are you doing here?

10:41.779 --> 10:44.247
Well, because I am a rock and
not a rock bottom, I decided

10:44.332 --> 10:47.033
to reach out to Mike and see
if I could get him some help

10:47.118 --> 10:48.618
with, uh, some of these issues
he's been having.

10:48.753 --> 10:50.953
I'm confused.
Is this a PTSD meeting for vets?

10:51.089 --> 10:53.256
Mm-hmm, yeah.
You're a military guy, right?

10:53.341 --> 10:55.791
No. It was just my stripper character.

10:55.927 --> 10:57.593
Really? Oh, I just figured you based

10:57.679 --> 11:00.630
- your characters off past experiences.
- Why?

11:00.765 --> 11:04.217
Okay, look, I-I'm not gonna
pass myself off as a vet, Frank.

11:04.302 --> 11:05.685
- Yeah, I don't feel good about this. Maybe...
- Well, then just don't talk.

11:05.803 --> 11:07.303
- But...
- You don't have to talk. Just sit down.

11:07.438 --> 11:09.639
Okay, everybody, let's grab a chair,
let's get this started.

11:09.774 --> 11:12.391
- Probably not gonna call on you anyway.
- Okay, right off

11:12.477 --> 11:14.310
the bat, I can see we got some newcomers

11:14.445 --> 11:16.979
here today. You guys
want to introduce yourselves?

11:17.115 --> 11:18.481
Ugh. Goddamn it.

11:18.616 --> 11:20.149
Uh, I'm Frank.

11:20.285 --> 11:22.618
I've been around the block,
seen some action.

11:22.704 --> 11:24.320
I was in 'Nam for a while.

11:24.455 --> 11:26.038
Private sector mostly.

11:26.157 --> 11:27.573
I did shoot a couple of dinks

11:27.659 --> 11:30.126
who tried to jack some
sneakers off the factory floor.

11:30.211 --> 11:31.410
No big deal.

11:31.496 --> 11:33.079
I don't feel nothing about it.

11:33.164 --> 11:35.498
I'm just here to support my buddy.

11:36.136 --> 11:37.250
Uh...

11:37.335 --> 11:39.051
Hello. I'm Dee. I'm a rock.

11:39.170 --> 11:40.720
I'm here with this guy.

11:40.838 --> 11:43.422
There was a bit of a mix-up
about his military credentials,

11:43.508 --> 11:45.841
but, uh... whatever.

11:45.977 --> 11:48.561
Now he's under the delusion
that he's hit rock bottom,

11:48.680 --> 11:52.565
you know, and I just don't see
how that's possibly true, so,

11:52.684 --> 11:54.567
we're gonna straighten
that up while we're

11:54.686 --> 11:56.185
sitting here today, you know.

11:56.321 --> 11:57.603
Mac's being a pussy!

11:57.689 --> 11:59.021
He doesn't want to fight anymore!

11:59.157 --> 12:00.439
I'm not being a pussy.

12:00.525 --> 12:01.824
I just don't want to
kill women and children.

12:01.909 --> 12:02.858
How do I get him

12:02.994 --> 12:04.827
to stop thinking of them as real people?

12:04.912 --> 12:06.195
Mike's embarrassed about his dancing,

12:06.331 --> 12:07.947
and I just... I don't get that.

12:08.032 --> 12:09.865
I don't... How is that
rock bottom behavior?

12:10.001 --> 12:11.417
You know? Think of Channing Tatum.

12:11.536 --> 12:13.286
Can you please explain
Channing Tatum to him?

12:13.371 --> 12:15.755
- I'm not sure I follow...
- Oh, yeah. He's G.I. Joe.

12:15.873 --> 12:16.956
Mac can't sleep at night.

12:17.041 --> 12:19.675
He's having erotic nightmares and shit.

12:19.761 --> 12:21.427
- He doesn't know what's real anymore.
- Yeah.

12:21.546 --> 12:24.096
Mike's embarrassed about his
video game-playing, which makes

12:24.215 --> 12:26.349
no sense to me, 'cause you know what?
Video games are hard.

12:26.434 --> 12:28.551
- You ever play <i>Fallujah?</i>
- Beat it five times.

12:28.686 --> 12:30.853
- You want to play with me?
- I'm actually trying to get away from that.

12:30.938 --> 12:32.305
Well, what if he paid you?

12:32.390 --> 12:33.184
Ten bucks an hour.

12:33.185 --> 12:34.185
- 20.
- Deal.

12:34.692 --> 12:36.440
- Wow. Really?
- Well, will you look at that?

12:36.441 --> 12:38.032
Now we're getting somewhere, huh?

12:38.067 --> 12:39.031
- Yeah.
- That couldn't have happened

12:39.032 --> 12:40.620
without your rock, could it?

12:40.655 --> 12:41.814
Wait a second, Frank. What about me?

12:41.899 --> 12:43.232
You're out. Dishonorable discharge.

12:43.368 --> 12:44.617
I'm sorry.

12:44.736 --> 12:46.235
What is happening here?

12:46.371 --> 12:47.536
Doesn't matter. We're done with you.

12:47.622 --> 12:48.821
- Yeah, we're good.
- Yeah.

12:56.414 --> 12:58.798
- Hey, son.
- Dad?!

13:00.043 --> 13:01.083
What are you doing here?

13:01.219 --> 13:03.803
I broke out of jail and
came straight to see you.

13:03.921 --> 13:08.024
- Because you love me?
- 'Cause I'm gonna kill you, son.

13:08.884 --> 13:09.809
Oh. Oh, no!

13:12.313 --> 13:14.680
What...? What-What's happening?

13:14.766 --> 13:16.432
When did I get here?
How long have I been asleep?

13:16.567 --> 13:17.983
You got here, like, five minutes ago.

13:18.102 --> 13:19.518
You've been asleep for 35 seconds.

13:19.604 --> 13:21.237
Oh, Jesus Christ,
I'm-I'm losing my mind.

13:21.322 --> 13:22.988
- I mean, I'm actually going insane.
- You know,

13:23.107 --> 13:24.523
we're all having a little
bit of a hard time right now.

13:24.609 --> 13:26.025
- Yeah.
- But we got to fight fire with fire,

13:26.110 --> 13:27.576
and Charlie and I refuse
to be defeated by this.

13:27.662 --> 13:28.994
We're gonna win this war.

13:29.113 --> 13:29.867
What war?

13:29.868 --> 13:32.125
- The war on women!
- Women, man!

13:32.333 --> 13:34.116
There's a war on women?
Can I get in on that?

13:34.252 --> 13:36.952
Bro, it's been raging
since the beginning of time, bro.

13:37.088 --> 13:38.454
- Oh.
- And we're losing ground.

13:38.589 --> 13:40.039
Phone!

13:41.110 --> 13:43.426
- Hello.
- Ah, yeah.

13:43.511 --> 13:45.795
Uh, yeah, is youse Daddy and the Boy?

13:46.237 --> 13:48.798
- Uh, y-yes, it is. Boy speaking.
- Oh.

13:48.933 --> 13:52.385
Yeah. Uh, I hear
youse are re... rule good.

13:52.470 --> 13:54.136
Well, yeah, that-that is true.

13:54.272 --> 13:55.855
Well, I've got a party for you.

13:55.973 --> 13:58.023
- Um, Daddy wants to speak with you.
- Yeah.

13:58.708 --> 14:00.476
Yeah, this is Daddy.
What's-what's the gig?

14:00.611 --> 14:03.362
Uh, yeah, a giant party.
Tons of sorority girls.

14:03.481 --> 14:05.281
Sorority girls.
Oh, sorority girls. Nice.

14:05.366 --> 14:08.033
Did you just lick your hand?
Yeah, that...

14:08.152 --> 14:11.237
that sounds good. Um, listen,
a few new ground rules, though.

14:11.322 --> 14:13.456
I'm a bad dad now. And, uh,

14:13.541 --> 14:15.291
the Boy's also gonna be dancing with me.

14:15.376 --> 14:17.293
Okay. Uh, whatever. Uh, uh...

14:17.378 --> 14:19.328
Yeah, we need Mike. We need him.

14:19.464 --> 14:21.831
- Mike? Why do you want Mike, Dee?
- What? You knew it was me?

14:21.966 --> 14:24.049
Of course I knew it was you.
Who else does accents so poorly?

14:24.168 --> 14:25.330
The accents were terrible.

14:25.331 --> 14:26.331
- The accents were terrible.
- All right, look, I just...

14:26.471 --> 14:28.564
I want him to have fun,
make a ton of money,

14:28.599 --> 14:30.165
party with a bunch of sorority girls,
you know?

14:30.301 --> 14:32.001
I need to show him that
this is a great life.

14:32.136 --> 14:33.919
This is not a rock-bottom life.

14:34.005 --> 14:35.504
We'll do it at Paddy's.
It'll be a win-win.

14:35.640 --> 14:37.673
- Make a ton of mon...
- Mmm.

14:37.808 --> 14:40.509
Yes. Okay.

14:40.645 --> 14:42.344
What? Hello?

14:42.480 --> 14:43.896
Goddamn it.

14:44.015 --> 14:46.231
This is good.
This is... th-this is good.

14:46.350 --> 14:48.651
Young girl sorority girls.
It's, like, age-appropriate for me,

14:48.736 --> 14:50.986
you know? Not like
those perverted librarians.

14:51.072 --> 14:53.405
- Cougars. Whatever, man.
- Yeah.

14:53.524 --> 14:55.441
And it's gonna be on our home turf.
Like, Paddy's.

14:55.526 --> 14:57.359
- Whoa. And with Mike, we'll be like a...
- Oh.

14:57.495 --> 14:59.778
We'll be like an elite stripping
dance force, like a unit, man.

14:59.864 --> 15:01.121
Dude, dude, dude, dude,

15:01.122 --> 15:02.122
- we're gonna look good, man.
- Yeah. Yeah, man.

15:02.366 --> 15:03.217
We're gonna win this war.

15:03.218 --> 15:04.618
- Oh, hell yeah. Oh, yeah.
- We're gonna win this war on women.

15:04.702 --> 15:07.202
You know what, Mac,
maybe we could use you after all.

15:08.756 --> 15:10.557
- He's asleep.
- Yeah, he's out.

15:10.674 --> 15:11.874
_

15:17.515 --> 15:19.798
It's amazing!
I can't believe they have zombies

15:19.884 --> 15:21.216
on the final level!

15:21.352 --> 15:23.469
I love zombies.
Ghouls, too. I love ghouls.

15:23.554 --> 15:25.988
Right now, if we can just
make it to that second box

15:26.090 --> 15:27.439
over there,
we can grab the all spark coin

15:27.558 --> 15:28.941
and we can win the game.

15:42.073 --> 15:44.139
<i>Frank. Frank.</i>

15:44.241 --> 15:44.957
Frank!

15:45.076 --> 15:45.991
Frank!

15:47.019 --> 15:48.577
Oh. What happened?

15:48.713 --> 15:50.779
- Where am I?
- Oh, you're in the back office.

15:50.882 --> 15:52.363
You passed out playing the game, dude.

15:52.364 --> 15:53.364
We dragged you back here
so you could sleep.

15:53.401 --> 15:55.884
Oh, Mac. I think I was too hard on you.

15:55.970 --> 15:58.220
I think I got PTSD, too.

15:58.305 --> 15:59.805
- Oh, no. We don't have that.
- Huh?

15:59.924 --> 16:01.557
Yeah, I actually slept about
ten hours last night, dude,

16:01.642 --> 16:03.092
and I feel great.

16:03.227 --> 16:05.511
I think we were just suffering
from sleep deprivation.

16:05.596 --> 16:07.596
Well, where's Mike?
I want to finish the game.

16:07.732 --> 16:09.398
Oh, we finished the game.
Yeah, like, right after

16:09.483 --> 16:11.233
you passed out,
Mike and I just got in there.

16:11.318 --> 16:13.318
- Dude, it was awesome.
- Do you want to do it again?

16:13.437 --> 16:14.853
No, I don't want to play anymore.

16:14.939 --> 16:16.522
Well, where's Mike? I'll do it with him.

16:16.607 --> 16:18.107
He's out, too. Yeah, he's doing

16:18.242 --> 16:19.942
some weird stripping thing
with Dennis and Charlie.

16:20.077 --> 16:22.111
I only woke you up
'cause I figured you'd want to see it.

16:22.246 --> 16:23.946
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

16:31.395 --> 16:32.845
I really appreciate you getting me

16:32.930 --> 16:34.096
this gig. I mean, truthfully,

16:34.231 --> 16:36.732
I don't think I was ready
to give this lifestyle up.

16:36.817 --> 16:38.183
Of course not. Why would you?
You're really good

16:38.269 --> 16:39.985
at dancing.
That's nothing to be ashamed of.

16:40.104 --> 16:42.154
Listen, you like video games?
I got you paid for it.

16:42.273 --> 16:44.773
You're a great stripper?
I got you this gig.

16:44.909 --> 16:46.441
- And you know what I'm gonna do for you next?
- What?

16:46.577 --> 16:48.110
I'm gonna reunite you
with your daughter.

16:48.245 --> 16:49.828
- Oh, man.
- Yep.

16:49.947 --> 16:52.247
Look, I really appreciate
everything you've done.

16:52.333 --> 16:54.950
- It really, really means a lot to me.
- Eh, well,

16:55.085 --> 16:57.002
you just needed your rock.

16:57.121 --> 16:58.147
Fire it up.

16:58.148 --> 16:59.648
- Smell good? Everything poppin'?
- All right. No, feels good.

16:59.673 --> 17:00.803
- Look good?
- I don't know. What do you think?

17:00.804 --> 17:01.604
- You like how it smells?
- It looks good.

17:01.625 --> 17:03.115
- And you can't see any of the blood.
- Okay, good.

17:03.116 --> 17:03.616
It's all patched up good.

17:03.627 --> 17:05.377
- What do you think about my prop, hmm?
- That's really cool.

17:05.462 --> 17:07.378
- A little kid licking that up there.
- Wait, what-what am I smelling?

17:07.464 --> 17:08.237
Cheese.

17:08.238 --> 17:09.238
- Is that made of cheese?
- Yeah, yeah.

17:09.300 --> 17:11.310
And then I painted the rest with,
like, magic marker and stuff.

17:11.310 --> 17:13.135
Oh, Christ. Why did you make
a cheese lollipop? It stinks.

17:13.270 --> 17:14.970
- For-for my nerves. Yeah.
- That smells horrible.

17:15.105 --> 17:17.105
Oh, God. There's nothing sexy
about cheese. Put it away.

17:17.837 --> 17:21.894
Ladies, are we ready
to party tonight?

17:23.113 --> 17:24.946
So am I.

17:25.318 --> 17:26.147
All right.

17:26.282 --> 17:28.901
We're gonna see some skin
tonight. Yeah.

17:28.986 --> 17:30.152
Scars and all.

17:30.287 --> 17:32.177
This, actually, is a real scar, too.

17:32.212 --> 17:33.739
And I got a good story behind that.

17:33.824 --> 17:36.325
This is, uh...
They took out the kidney, actually,

17:36.460 --> 17:38.327
from the fron... A Chinaman.
And he did not know

17:38.462 --> 17:39.878
how to do it, I'll tell you that much.

17:40.532 --> 17:41.797
Cricket was a bad idea, huh?

17:41.882 --> 17:43.715
Yeah, I know.
But we needed that, like, you know,

17:43.834 --> 17:46.718
- McConaughey emcee-type.
- Yeah. But looks like we got

17:46.837 --> 17:48.720
AIDS <i> Dallas Buyers Club</i> McConaughey,

17:48.839 --> 17:50.889
- not <i> Magic Mike</i> McConaughey.
- That is what he looks like.

17:51.008 --> 17:52.557
- It's a good crowd, though. It's a good crowd.
- He's... Yeah.

17:52.676 --> 17:54.009
All right, well...

17:54.144 --> 17:55.260
That was the first time
that I really thought,

17:55.346 --> 17:57.262
"Hey, I might actually, uh...

17:57.348 --> 18:01.400
I might die, and...
and no one's gonna remember."

18:03.543 --> 18:05.627
All right! Hey!

18:05.746 --> 18:06.853
Let's, uh, keep it movin'.

18:06.853 --> 18:08.913
Keepin' it real, keepin' it sexy,

18:09.049 --> 18:10.915
and takin' back the power,

18:11.051 --> 18:13.752
let's give it up for Daddy and the Boy!

18:23.877 --> 18:26.178
Hey, Boy, let's have a catch.

18:27.548 --> 18:28.547
Over here, Pop.

18:29.516 --> 18:31.559
Hey. Good throw, son.

18:31.716 --> 18:32.798
I love you, Dad!

18:32.917 --> 18:34.216
- I love you, too, son.
- Oh?

18:34.301 --> 18:36.001
And even though I never
even said it enough.

18:36.087 --> 18:36.969
What is this?

18:37.088 --> 18:37.970
I wasn't a good... Shh!

18:38.089 --> 18:40.639
I wasn't a good father to you,
and-and I regret that now.

18:40.758 --> 18:42.975
No, that's fine, because now
is our chance to connect.

18:43.094 --> 18:44.009
This is super weird.

18:44.095 --> 18:45.811
Hey! Shush, all right?

18:45.930 --> 18:48.013
This is our thing.
We have the power. You don't talk.

18:48.099 --> 18:49.431
All right, you know what,
Dad, don't listen to them,

18:49.567 --> 18:50.899
'cause we're gonna win this war.

18:50.985 --> 18:52.151
This is not sexy!

18:52.269 --> 18:53.402
Just take something off!

18:53.487 --> 18:54.653
You know, you take something off!

18:54.772 --> 18:56.605
All right, look,
it's too hot for baseball.

18:56.741 --> 18:58.774
I'm gonna take my clothes off now.
I think.

18:58.909 --> 19:01.360
- Okay!
- Yeah, now we'll take our clothes off.

19:01.763 --> 19:02.709
Yeah!

19:03.164 --> 19:05.581
Wait, wait, son, don't.
Don't. They're laughing.

19:05.666 --> 19:07.616
Don't take your clothes off if
they're laughing. We have the power.

19:07.752 --> 19:10.002
- It's not a joke!
- It's not a joke, all right? This is sexy.

19:11.288 --> 19:12.955
Oh, stop, sto... Oh, you know what?

19:13.090 --> 19:14.673
You might want to check your programs
'cause I'm bad dad now.

19:14.792 --> 19:16.175
I'll take you to your goddamn room.

19:16.293 --> 19:19.094
- I'll bend you over my knee.
- Take your dicks out!

19:19.180 --> 19:22.381
All right, listen to me. This is it,
this is what you were made for.

19:22.466 --> 19:26.011
Now you get out there
and save the day, soldier.

19:28.717 --> 19:30.288
This is about a father and a son

19:30.407 --> 19:32.774
- whose relation...
- Oh, come on!

19:32.876 --> 19:35.487
And now the moment
you've all been waiting for.

19:35.487 --> 19:37.162

I didn't mean to!

You're disgusting!

My finger touched your asshole!

Never talk to me again!

I got you. I'm your rock bottom?

20:33.844 --> 20:35.544
I'm your rock...
That's your rock bottom,

20:35.680 --> 20:37.763
sticking your dick in your
daughter's face, you son of a bitch.

20:37.882 --> 20:39.614

- Get out of here!

20:39.650 --> 20:41.099
That's my daughter!

20:41.559 --> 20:42.345
Oh.

20:43.737 --> 20:44.903
Yes!

20:46.357 --> 20:48.273
- Wow.
- Jesus Christ.

20:48.359 --> 20:50.659
- Wow, Dee, that was dark.
- That's like the darkest thing you've ever done.

20:50.744 --> 20:51.910
You know what that was?

20:52.029 --> 20:53.612
- That was your rock bottom.
- Yeah.

20:53.697 --> 20:55.163
- Yeah. - Hmm.
- Whatever.

20:55.249 --> 20:57.332
Feel good.
I don't want to talk about it.

20:57.418 --> 20:59.117
I don't want to talk about my thing.
You want to talk about your thing?

20:59.203 --> 21:00.454
- No, no, let's not.
- You know what we should do?

21:00.538 --> 21:02.509
Let's just, uh... let's just get drunk.

21:02.510 --> 21:03.510
- Yeah, come on.
- Let's not talk about trauma.

21:03.707 --> 21:04.673
- Or deal with any of that shit.
- Woo.

21:04.758 --> 21:06.124
Let's just have a good
time and get drunk, huh?

21:06.210 --> 21:07.676
Stuff it down with some brown.
