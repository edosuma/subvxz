00:01.227 --> 00:04.657
Anyone watching thinking we know
fuck all about knowing

00:04.777 --> 00:07.531
fuck all about owt,
needs to watch their back.

00:08.122 --> 00:11.924
So you've had your Labour,
reclassifying skunk, sending prices,

00:12.044 --> 00:16.661
sky-high literally, literally
taking the grass from its own roots!

00:16.781 --> 00:19.496
And now you've
got your ConDem Nation.

00:19.616 --> 00:23.146
Liberals noshing Tories
like altar boys picking dimps up!

00:23.266 --> 00:26.899
Have we had a national fucking
stroke? Or what?

00:27.019 --> 00:30.728
Is revolution a word or
was it never?

00:30.848 --> 00:33.653
Anybody watching
needs to know, we cope

00:33.773 --> 00:36.458
better than average
with irony in Chatsworth.

00:36.578 --> 00:40.123
Well, for fuck's sake,
we live in Manchester

00:40.243 --> 00:42.779
and they charge us for water.

00:43.036 --> 00:47.951
I wandered lonely as a clown,
necking mushrooms rarely found.

00:48.071 --> 00:51.262
This green and pleasant
land in ancient times...

00:51.382 --> 00:54.052
Yak yak yak yak yak yak yak yak yak!

00:54.172 --> 00:57.301
It's not theirs any more.

00:57.421 --> 00:59.769
This is our England now.

01:00.090 --> 01:01.707

01:11.553 --> 01:14.971

that I didn't think I'd make it.

01:15.974 --> 01:20.025

01:21.666 --> 01:24.896

The grass isn't always greener.

Inside and out, yeah?

02:24.393 --> 02:28.007
It'll just be a small affair.
Finger buffet, decorations.

02:28.010 --> 02:31.195
The young ones are all charlied up,
it's all they can do

02:31.196 --> 02:32.733
to prize their jaws apart,

02:32.742 --> 02:36.008
never mind tackle a Scotch egg.
You'll be wasting your money.

02:36.014 --> 02:37.426
It's Carl's 21st.

02:37.433 --> 02:39.357
We need to mark it.

02:41.347 --> 02:44.181
How have you managed to
run up a £500 phone bill?

02:48.137 --> 02:49.469
I haven't.
Joe has.

02:49.470 --> 02:51.394
It's addressed to the shop.

02:51.401 --> 02:54.519
Grandad's shop. Which he left
in your incapable hands.

02:54.525 --> 02:56.164
Sort it!

02:58.645 --> 03:00.023
It's a gay sex line.

03:00.240 --> 03:03.045
Joe rented it, got some lads to
man the phones. He raked it in.

03:03.103 --> 03:04.001
How the fuck do you know?

03:04.004 --> 03:05.768
I was never off 'em.

03:05.773 --> 03:06.969
What?.!

03:06.970 --> 03:08.609
I mean, Ian was never off them.

03:08.614 --> 03:09.855
Dirty bastard.

03:09.863 --> 03:12.161
Filthy fuck.

03:12.162 --> 03:15.565
It's a pound a minute off peak,
£1.50 peak.

03:15.573 --> 03:17.986
Stories take a few minutes
to really kick in,

03:17.997 --> 03:21.934
so you're talking a fiver at least before
the money shot, but it's well worth it.

03:21.935 --> 03:23.597
So Ian said.

03:23.604 --> 03:25.470
But you'd make a killing.

03:25.471 --> 03:27.747
You know, "Suck my throbbing
cock" and all that stuff.

03:27.751 --> 03:30.301
I'm not talking dirty
so some fruit can have a wank.

03:30.303 --> 03:33.512
No, yeah, I don't blame you.
Fucking pervs!

03:37.418 --> 03:39.854
Our joint account's two grand down.

03:43.629 --> 03:46.554
We agreed Jamie wasn't
getting a cut of our business.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.201
Look, it all goes in the pot anyway.

03:48.234 --> 03:51.246
Whose pot?
Certainly not ours.

03:51.253 --> 03:55.316
He'll be wanting a cut from
my takings at Lillian's next.

03:55.319 --> 03:56.542
Why didn't you tell me?

03:56.879 --> 03:59.014
Because I knew
you'd react like this.

03:59.023 --> 04:01.618
What's it gonna take for you
to actually stand up to him?

04:01.626 --> 04:05.950
How many times will he have
to fuck you over, fuck us over,

04:05.957 --> 04:08.529
before you tell him enough's enough?

04:09.417 --> 04:13.184

a pair of bollocks, eh, Shane.

You normally charge?

05:36.601 --> 05:37.807
Can't make much.

05:37.927 --> 05:40.190
I'd do it again for
the price of a pint.

Sita. Friday?

05:54.602 --> 05:58.015
Maybe when you're driving the car,
not washing it.

05:58.016 --> 06:01.782
Yeah, thanks for fucking nothing(!)

06:01.783 --> 06:04.070
You're the only one
with an outside tap.

06:04.071 --> 06:06.028
It's not a problem, Carl.

06:06.029 --> 06:09.341
Oh, let's just give him the
keys to the house then, shall we!

06:09.346 --> 06:12.252
Keys. Here, take my wallet.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.515
Jackson, give it a rest.

06:14.578 --> 06:15.501
Mate, it's only a bit of water!

06:15.621 --> 06:18.285
Which I pay for!

06:19.607 --> 06:21.667
Put that towards your next bill.

06:29.284 --> 06:32.310
They'd have the eyes out the back
of your head. Thieving bastards.

06:32.343 --> 06:33.086
Yeah.

06:33.093 --> 06:35.859
Avril in?
You left this in the pub.

06:35.867 --> 06:39.481
And I think these bananas
are on the turn.

06:39.551 --> 06:40.740
They're plantain.

06:40.748 --> 06:43.957
Ah, thanks for bringing
them round, Meems.

06:43.958 --> 06:46.428
Never seen half of this stuff.

06:46.437 --> 06:48.156
You must've seen one of these.

06:48.158 --> 06:50.434
Only coming out of a tin.

06:50.436 --> 06:53.941
I can't stand all that
processed food. I'd sooner starve.

06:53.947 --> 06:55.711
I like to make a dish from scratch.

06:55.719 --> 06:59.156
You know, stuff you learned
watching your ma in the kitchen.

06:59.182 --> 07:01.410
It's tradition.
I was brought up that way.

07:01.463 --> 07:02.632
He's full of it, isn't he?

07:02.708 --> 07:04.652
He's full of something.

07:04.654 --> 07:06.698
It's about making an effort.

07:06.818 --> 07:09.608
It's hard getting to get motivated
when you're on your own, though.

07:09.864 --> 07:11.807
You should come and
have dinner with us.

07:11.927 --> 07:13.174
I wouldn't want
to get in the way.

07:13.294 --> 07:16.860
You wouldn't. We've always got mates
round our table. It's tradition.

07:16.980 --> 07:19.124
We were brought up that way.

07:19.127 --> 07:20.022
I'd love to.

07:20.142 --> 07:21.139
That's settled then.

07:21.259 --> 07:23.441
Jackson can rustle something up
he learned from watching his mum.

07:23.442 --> 07:24.592
Can't wait!

07:24.595 --> 07:25.791
Neither can I.

07:25.795 --> 07:27.412
See ya later.

07:27.413 --> 07:29.280
Bye, love.

07:33.043 --> 07:35.240
If I'd known I were gonna get me
legs slapped,

07:35.249 --> 07:36.558
I would've worn my shorts.

07:36.563 --> 07:39.066
I'm not slapping you. I like her.

07:39.077 --> 07:40.932
You're doing this to wind me up.

07:40.941 --> 07:43.228
For once, this isn't about you.

07:43.239 --> 07:46.392
It's about being neighbourly.
Making friends.

07:46.398 --> 07:47.798
I teach their kids.

07:47.803 --> 07:49.556
I see them everyday
at the school gates.

07:49.676 --> 07:50.992
I don't want them round for dinner.

07:51.112 --> 07:53.392
We all know what this is about.

07:53.393 --> 07:56.784
This is about me not wanting
that type under my roof.

07:56.788 --> 07:58.052
That type?

07:58.059 --> 08:01.109
Oh, you know what I mean.

08:01.113 --> 08:03.321
I'm an educated man,
I don't think that way.

08:10.334 --> 08:12.724
I want them looking like
they've just come off the lot.

08:12.728 --> 08:15.743
Bet that back seat's seen a bit of
action. Imagine if it could talk, eh?

08:15.744 --> 08:16.928
Just make sure it doesn't.

08:16.934 --> 08:18.209
Jamie, quick word?

08:18.218 --> 08:20.529
Busy. Harry?

08:20.531 --> 08:21.783
Yeah.

08:21.792 --> 08:23.818
Mate, I'm wasted cleaning cars.

08:23.819 --> 08:24.935
Tell it to somebody
who gives a shit.

08:24.946 --> 08:26.584
Well, get a kid to do it.

08:26.585 --> 08:27.917
We have.

08:28.037 --> 08:29.251
I'll get on it right now
and get back to you in a bit.

08:29.324 --> 08:31.083
Got nothing more interesting going?

08:31.089 --> 08:33.070
For you? No.

08:34.239 --> 08:37.366
Jamie, got nothing a
bit more demanding than this?

08:37.368 --> 08:39.826
I can always find
something for the right man.

08:41.791 --> 08:47.094
Jamie, I've just told him no.
You just made me look a right twat.

08:47.102 --> 08:49.743
I do the hiring and firing.
And you are a right twat.

08:59.773 --> 09:01.264
Come on, come on!

09:03.377 --> 09:05.426
You've got the
bandages off now then, eh?

09:05.429 --> 09:07.842
Yeah, yeah they come off last night,
yeah.

09:09.506 --> 09:11.236
What happened to her?

09:11.241 --> 09:12.562
Loan shark.

09:12.568 --> 09:16.892
Well, you know what they say. If
you can't swim, keep out the water.

09:16.900 --> 09:20.872
It was the only way she could afford
that luxury spa weekend.

09:24.915 --> 09:27.726
Thought you could do
with some cheering up.

09:38.392 --> 09:39.994
Not screaming "Me", is it?

09:40.114 --> 09:41.896
Well, no that's why I bought it.

09:41.898 --> 09:44.015
Thought you could wear
it on your nights off.

09:44.022 --> 09:46.150
I've embarrassed you, haven't I?

09:46.151 --> 09:47.994
No.

09:47.995 --> 09:49.805
Ta.

09:49.812 --> 09:51.052
Right, what can I get you?

09:51.063 --> 09:54.216
Do you know, I've gone off the idea.

09:54.219 --> 09:57.372
Come on, Sandra,
we can't afford this.

09:57.381 --> 09:59.998
Oi!

10:00.009 --> 10:01.728
What's up with her?

10:01.732 --> 10:02.882
You're her husband.

10:12.169 --> 10:15.435
Fresh from the chippy.

10:17.247 --> 10:19.558
I'd sooner have our two grand back.

10:19.562 --> 10:20.962
Just give me a bit of time, eh?

10:20.966 --> 10:24.907
I tried that. Result?
Jamie and Karen are still taking the piss.

10:25.027 --> 10:26.097
As well as our money.

10:28.082 --> 10:30.557
What do you think?
She's got the legs for them.

10:30.677 --> 10:33.272
Karen bought me them.

10:33.281 --> 10:35.762
(With our money.) Kel...

10:35.769 --> 10:38.956
Jamie took the money we made from
the school's security contract.

10:38.961 --> 10:41.226
Of course you knew that already.

10:41.229 --> 10:43.640
That was family money.
You got your cut.

10:43.641 --> 10:46.839
Cut!? We earned every
penny that's in there!

10:46.845 --> 10:48.883
Rein her in, Shane.

10:48.886 --> 10:53.336
That might've been the way your
marriage worked, Mimi, but not mine.

10:53.340 --> 10:55.013
I'll get the cash meself.

10:55.014 --> 10:58.132
Like I should have
done in the first place.

11:09.237 --> 11:11.604
Got the Young Conservatives
in again?

11:12.462 --> 11:14.144
What's the damage?

11:14.264 --> 11:15.727
£8.69.

11:15.847 --> 11:17.177
How apt.

11:17.180 --> 11:18.899
Stick it on me slate.

11:18.906 --> 11:21.238
No.
No more credit!

11:21.249 --> 11:22.263
Laters 'taters!

11:22.266 --> 11:24.349
It's nearly a ton now!

11:37.478 --> 11:38.730
Suck my throbbing cock?

11:42.169 --> 11:43.603
Fuck.

11:43.604 --> 11:45.038
Erm.

11:48.072 --> 11:50.688
Look, Ches, erm,

11:50.689 --> 11:56.185
thanks for the offer and that
but, erm, you're not really my type.

11:56.194 --> 11:58.095
I'm talking about that sex line.

11:58.097 --> 12:00.032
Oh, me too, yeah.

12:00.038 --> 12:03.087
I can't get it out me head.

12:03.088 --> 12:04.579
Yeah, dirty things.

12:04.588 --> 12:08.491
I've got final demands coming out
my fucking ears. How does it work?

12:11.435 --> 12:14.440
Ha! I wondered how long it'd be
before the Missus kicked him out

12:14.449 --> 12:16.589
and told him to get things sorted.

12:16.595 --> 12:18.735
Adding psychic to your
long list of talents?

12:18.743 --> 12:20.428
Karen phoned.

12:21.225 --> 12:24.753
I just want a fair deal.
And so does Kel.

12:24.758 --> 12:27.284
You've got a fair deal.
You get a cut that's in direct

12:27.285 --> 12:28.832
proportion to the risks you take.

12:28.833 --> 12:31.360
We're brothers, equal.

12:31.366 --> 12:32.902
Never have been, never will be.

12:32.913 --> 12:36.725
Right, I've got a few, a few ideas
of me own. I want to them try out.

12:36.726 --> 12:41.210
You had your chance to run things
and you got your arse kicked.

12:41.216 --> 12:43.140
That's why I'm in
charge and you're not.

12:43.142 --> 12:45.623
Lock up.

12:45.631 --> 12:46.678
How did I do?

12:46.679 --> 12:48.807
Good.

12:48.808 --> 12:50.868
Any problems?

12:50.869 --> 12:53.623
In the boot. I mean, I don't
know what's been going on but...

12:53.627 --> 12:55.551
Best not knowing.
Can you live with that?

12:55.560 --> 12:57.996
Yeah.

12:57.999 --> 12:59.286
Good.

12:59.290 --> 13:01.065
That's going
straight in my 21st fund.

13:01.076 --> 13:03.785
Got another job lined up for
tomorrow, if you're interested?

13:03.790 --> 13:04.929
Yeah, too right.

13:04.933 --> 13:06.708
Get yourself something smart, yeah?
Presentable.

13:06.719 --> 13:09.188
Working for the family now.

13:09.199 --> 13:11.009
That's right.

13:25.539 --> 13:29.217
Got to hand it to you,
Jackson, that food was beautiful.

13:29.337 --> 13:30.148
Ta.

13:30.253 --> 13:31.755
And all learned at his ma's knee.

13:31.875 --> 13:35.747
More Delia Smith than his mother
but at least he made the effort.

13:35.758 --> 13:36.897
Bollocks.

13:36.900 --> 13:38.123
You lost something?

13:38.243 --> 13:41.196
Billie Holliday. I lent it out
and I haven't had it back.

13:41.316 --> 13:44.137
Billie Holliday? Christ knows
she needs a fucking holiday!

13:44.138 --> 13:46.197
Have you heard the screeching
from her?

13:46.208 --> 13:47.358
She sang about racial hatred.

13:47.367 --> 13:48.995
Nothing she could
tell me about that.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.753
Because of Liverpool's
involvement in the slave trade?

13:50.757 --> 13:55.775
The Toxteth riots. I stood
shoulder to shoulder with your lot.

13:55.777 --> 13:59.887
And I looted a fabulous fucking
telly and video while I was at it!

14:00.007 --> 14:02.378
You joined in the struggle
against oppression

14:02.498 --> 14:04.028
and came away with
a brand new Surround Sound?

14:04.148 --> 14:05.321
Wages of war.

14:05.322 --> 14:06.540
Race war.

14:06.543 --> 14:09.171
That was the angle
Thatcher and her mob pushed.

14:09.172 --> 14:12.711
Had fuck all to do with race
and everything to do with the fact

14:12.714 --> 14:16.140
that anyone who lived in that area
got treated like shite

14:16.144 --> 14:21.663
by that Tory bitch. We got to the point
where we decided enough was enough.

14:21.783 --> 14:22.967
Good on you.

14:23.316 --> 14:26.514
You're too young to remember,
if you lived in places like Toxteth,

14:26.515 --> 14:30.305
Moss Side, St Paul's
in the 70's and 80's,

14:30.314 --> 14:33.943
you were black
whether you were black or not.

14:33.954 --> 14:36.117
Know what I mean?

14:37.901 --> 14:40.860
"I'm a fucking scally
and I'm screwing your gaff.

14:40.862 --> 14:43.797
"If you don't tell the dibble,
I'll let you pull down my trackies

14:43.798 --> 14:46.700
"and swallow my big hard cock.

14:46.705 --> 14:49.619
"Smack my arse till it's red raw.
Stick your fingers up my..."

14:49.627 --> 14:51.504
Fuck right off!

14:51.505 --> 14:54.020
This is disgusting, man!

14:54.026 --> 14:56.337
Well, it's supply and demand.

14:56.340 --> 14:59.914
Where there's shit, there's brass.
Now, do you need the cash or not?

15:07.049 --> 15:08.859
"That's right, I'm scum.

15:08.867 --> 15:12.133
"Just out of Borstal,
balls ready to burst.

15:12.139 --> 15:15.984
"Now, work your tongue
around my tight, working-class..."

15:15.985 --> 15:21.390
No! It's, "Work your tongue down my
throbbing shaft, licking your way

15:21.393 --> 15:23.385
"to my tight working-class ring".

15:23.394 --> 15:24.988
Get it right, for fuck's sake!

15:24.990 --> 15:26.708
And your rhythm's all wrong.

15:26.709 --> 15:29.623
You'll be losing punters
left, right and centre.

15:29.628 --> 15:31.825
Now, go again from the top.

15:33.330 --> 15:35.094
Ready?

15:35.101 --> 15:36.388
"I'm a working-class scally..."

15:36.392 --> 15:37.406
Bit gruffer.

15:37.409 --> 15:38.457
"I'm a working class scally."

15:38.465 --> 15:39.479
Spot on.

15:39.483 --> 15:41.350
"And I'm screwing your gaff."
Filthy cunt.

15:45.028 --> 15:46.224
Mind if I hand these out?

15:46.225 --> 15:47.876
What are they?

15:47.882 --> 15:49.499
Discount vouchers. Recession.

15:49.505 --> 15:51.975
Not much money about, is there?

15:51.984 --> 15:54.545
Not as much as there used to be.

15:54.549 --> 15:59.327
Anything you want for a tenner.
Gonna film it, too.

15:59.328 --> 16:02.855
Chance for you to be the star
of your own little movie.

16:02.866 --> 16:05.017
How about that?

16:05.026 --> 16:07.405
What do you think you're doing?

16:07.413 --> 16:09.724
Can't you read?

16:11.738 --> 16:14.128
Not here. Not ever.

16:14.133 --> 16:18.150
Cos everybody knows nothing
underhand happens in here, don't they?

16:18.155 --> 16:19.430
Get out of my pub.

16:19.433 --> 16:21.584
But it's not your pub.

16:21.585 --> 16:23.748
Jamie robbed it from under your nose

16:23.752 --> 16:25.858
when you were having your wobbly.

16:25.861 --> 16:26.909
Or did you forget?

16:43.067 --> 16:45.343
What the fuck is going on?

16:46.603 --> 16:49.141
Like a pair of bitches on heat!

16:49.142 --> 16:54.250
Pack it in! This is getting sorted
once and for all. Family pow-wow.

16:54.251 --> 16:56.050
I'll tell you where and when.

16:56.059 --> 16:57.482
Now git!

16:58.592 --> 16:59.981
And you!

17:02.102 --> 17:04.151
Drink.

17:04.157 --> 17:06.297
I said drink!

17:06.298 --> 17:09.337
Go straight to that address,
no detours, no fucking about.

17:09.344 --> 17:11.655
You do not let this
out of your sight.

17:11.657 --> 17:14.560
You need to give it
to a guy called Kermit.

17:14.561 --> 17:15.883
Understood. Family business.

17:15.886 --> 17:18.231
Important family business.

17:18.239 --> 17:20.288
We only talk on that.

17:20.290 --> 17:22.727
You'll need a car.

17:34.590 --> 17:36.820
Bit old for joyriding.

17:36.831 --> 17:40.473
Company car. On business.
I finish at six.

17:40.481 --> 17:43.133
That right?
I'll pick you up outside the shop.

17:43.142 --> 17:46.761
Come on, live a little. Listen, I'm
a nice guy when you get to know me.

17:46.768 --> 17:51.297
That's what all the girls say.. We could be
on the Dales in half an hour. Country pub.

17:51.298 --> 17:54.017
Bit of food.
I'll be outside the shop at six.

17:54.018 --> 17:56.283
Make sure you are.

18:10.192 --> 18:13.504
Step, kick, turn. step, kick, turn.

18:13.509 --> 18:16.536
Kick and turn.

18:18.631 --> 18:21.600
Step, kick, turn, and pop.

18:21.601 --> 18:22.740
Hold it.

18:23.819 --> 18:26.323
Plie down slowly.

18:26.329 --> 18:28.742
Like grinding on a cock.

18:28.751 --> 18:32.381
Come on, Saskia,
get your knees wider than that.

18:32.387 --> 18:35.744
I've seen you on Saturday night
on the wheelie bin out back.

18:35.753 --> 18:38.348
Big finale! Teeth and tits.

18:39.960 --> 18:41.508
Fuck me. Just tits.

18:42.580 --> 18:47.245
And...five, six, seven, eight.

18:47.256 --> 18:50.147
Sex on a fucking plate!

18:50.148 --> 18:52.753
Right. Get yourselves
washed up ladies, top and tail.

18:52.764 --> 18:55.507
Fucking stinks like a fucking
fishmonger's in here, fuck me.

18:55.509 --> 18:58.445
Like fucking Grimsby.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.431
I take it you're not here
for the audition.

19:02.434 --> 19:05.473
It's Maguire business.

19:05.475 --> 19:07.649
Not here, you fucking idiot!

19:07.652 --> 19:10.566
Never in public, you fucking twat!

19:16.990 --> 19:18.379
You must be Carl.

19:18.388 --> 19:19.595
Carl Gallagher.

19:22.125 --> 19:23.776
Not a Maguire.

19:23.785 --> 19:25.504
Jamie must trust you.

19:25.513 --> 19:27.755
His right-hand man.

19:30.869 --> 19:35.910
An alsation ripped me throat open
and swallowed me voice box.

19:35.917 --> 19:39.217
We laugh about it now,
don't we, Griffin?

19:40.492 --> 19:42.325
Don't worry.

19:42.332 --> 19:44.859
He's been fed.

19:48.264 --> 19:52.167
You'll have to go upstairs
in the bar while I count this.

19:55.829 --> 19:59.526
Tasty little Pole on a pole up next.

19:59.527 --> 20:03.499
You can fuck her if you want.
My treat.

20:03.502 --> 20:06.518
She likes it up the Gary.

20:15.362 --> 20:17.411
Down, Griffin!

20:21.327 --> 20:22.659
She hates Billie Holliday.

20:22.660 --> 20:24.925
I hate Billie Holliday.

20:24.934 --> 20:28.041
Can't stand Michael Jackson, think
Al Green's only ever done three

20:28.044 --> 20:31.265
decent tunes in his life. Don't get
me started on Diana bleedin' Ross.

20:31.268 --> 20:33.818
She treated the riots as an
excuse for a looting spree.

20:33.821 --> 20:35.733
I think some of your black
brothers may have done the same.

20:35.736 --> 20:38.718
We both know what the root
of this particular problem is.

20:38.720 --> 20:40.034
Not that again.

20:40.154 --> 20:43.866
You're a Man U fan. All Man U
fans hate Scousers, admit it.

20:43.874 --> 20:44.944
You're being ridiculous.

20:44.947 --> 20:47.451
You're accusing Mimi of all sorts,

20:47.454 --> 20:49.480
when you and I both know
who the real bigot is.

20:49.486 --> 20:51.740
I resent that.
She says we're different.

20:51.745 --> 20:55.125
You'd call her a racist
if she didn't. She can't win.

20:55.128 --> 20:58.133
You've got me all wrong.
All I'm saying is,

20:58.142 --> 21:01.249
you can't make assumptions on
the colour of someone's skin.

21:01.254 --> 21:04.042
I know, babe. I mean,

21:04.044 --> 21:06.685
I always assumed
all black men had big cocks.

21:12.199 --> 21:14.225
Give us those here!

21:36.102 --> 21:38.014
Going somewhere?

21:42.326 --> 21:44.454
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about!

21:44.455 --> 21:46.867
I thought you said
this was untouched?

21:46.878 --> 21:49.416
Jamie handed it to me
and I handed it to you.

21:49.423 --> 21:52.188
Jamie's too clued in
to cross me, son,

21:52.189 --> 21:57.401
which means the only person stupid
enough to try and rip me off is you.

21:57.405 --> 21:58.952
No, Kermy!

21:58.953 --> 22:01.582
It's Kermit, you little
piece of fucking shite!

22:04.634 --> 22:06.966
You touch me and Jamie'll come down

22:06.967 --> 22:10.757
on you so fuckin' hard! It's the
Maguires you're messing with now!

22:10.762 --> 22:12.629
You think Jamie's gonna go to war

22:12.631 --> 22:15.112
with me over a waste
of space like you?

22:15.118 --> 22:17.064
Look, what the fuck's
all this about?.!

22:17.065 --> 22:21.252
Down, Griffin!
This is two grand light.

22:21.263 --> 22:24.541
It can't be.
It's never left my side.

22:24.549 --> 22:26.621
What the fuck do you think
you're doing?

22:26.623 --> 22:29.685
I'm going to teach you
a lesson, son,

22:29.690 --> 22:32.456
that you're never
going to fucking forget.

22:32.464 --> 22:33.637
Oh, please, no!

22:33.646 --> 22:36.753
Hold him down, Judy.

22:55.120 --> 22:58.192
I swear to God, I didn't
touch a penny of it!

22:58.203 --> 23:00.787
Please, not that, anything but that.

23:00.789 --> 23:03.543
Please just don't bum me,
please, Kermit!

23:03.548 --> 23:07.554
Bum you!? I'm not going to fucking
bum you, you filthy little fucker.

23:07.555 --> 23:09.831
I'm changing into me
trackie bottoms!

23:09.837 --> 23:13.615
I've got two new numbers to
choreograph by Friday lunchtime.

23:13.618 --> 23:16.190
Jamie'll vouch for me.
I'd never do nothing like that.

23:16.191 --> 23:17.728
I'm not a thief, I swear to God!

23:17.734 --> 23:19.543
Will you stop your fuckin' moaning?

23:19.554 --> 23:21.125
Jesus...!

23:21.130 --> 23:22.665
Fucking wasn't me.

23:22.666 --> 23:25.625
I've been doing business
with the Maguires

23:25.633 --> 23:28.649
since before you were born, son.

23:28.651 --> 23:30.700
Paddy never let me down,

23:30.709 --> 23:34.772
Mimi never let me down,
Jamie never let me down.

23:34.773 --> 23:38.312
Until he started using you.

23:38.319 --> 23:39.753
I never...

23:43.547 --> 23:46.802
I can't run the risk of another
little toe-rag ripping me off,

23:46.810 --> 23:49.655
thinking I'll just
stand back and do nothing.

23:49.660 --> 23:52.801
I have to send out a very clear
message that this type

23:52.807 --> 23:55.083
of behaviour will not be tolerated.

23:56.910 --> 23:58.379
Oh, no...

23:58.380 --> 24:00.907
Which one's your wanking hand?

24:00.916 --> 24:02.396
What?

24:02.403 --> 24:05.829
It's not a difficult question,
you thick fucking twat!

24:05.832 --> 24:08.962
Which one's your fucking jizz fist?

24:08.963 --> 24:10.545
Left or right?

24:10.546 --> 24:13.118
I'm...I'm ambidextrous.

24:13.122 --> 24:16.160
Ooh, he's ambidextrous, Judy.

24:16.161 --> 24:19.359
I'll just have to cut a finger
off both, then, won't I?

24:19.362 --> 24:23.265
Hold him still, Judy, or I'll
have the fucking lot off.

24:23.271 --> 24:25.968
Tell your mates, Carl.

24:25.973 --> 24:28.625
Nobody fucks with Kermit.

24:28.633 --> 24:30.671
Not even little Miss Piggy.

24:30.675 --> 24:32.121
Please, please!

24:44.127 --> 24:45.118
Me bollocks!

25:28.778 --> 25:30.156
Peek a boo!

25:30.164 --> 25:31.382
Aaaaaaaaaah!

25:44.833 --> 25:47.496
..Yep, cool.
Meet you there in a bit.

25:47.536 --> 25:49.005
Bye.

25:49.969 --> 25:53.235
Just off to meet a friend in town.

25:53.238 --> 25:57.130
Well, next time you report to granddad,
tell him I'm back in the black, yeah?

25:57.795 --> 25:59.650
All sorted,
like I said it would be.

26:11.316 --> 26:15.049
After that feast you cooked me,
I want to return the favour.

26:15.055 --> 26:17.730
Been ringing round
me mates from Tocky.

26:17.736 --> 26:20.502
Don't know whether
to do Afro-Caribbean...

26:20.507 --> 26:22.271
Somali...

26:22.278 --> 26:23.530
Thai?

26:23.539 --> 26:25.346
Very multicultural.

26:25.637 --> 26:27.447
Never judge a book by its cover.

26:27.449 --> 26:29.282
Obviously.

26:31.204 --> 26:33.515
Every colour of the rainbow
where I grew up.

26:33.524 --> 26:36.129
At school, I was a right wigger.

26:36.130 --> 26:41.524
Had the Bo Derek braids
and loved Boney M, and The Cosbys.

26:41.525 --> 26:43.892
Can't thank you enough
for your support.

26:43.903 --> 26:47.169
I'm just one big melting pot, me.

26:51.805 --> 26:55.278
Got a few football tickets to get
rid of behind the bar, Mum. Usual.

26:55.285 --> 26:57.287
I'll take the Liverpool ones.

26:57.298 --> 26:59.949
Wouldn't touch the United ones
with a shitty stick, though.

27:00.182 --> 27:03.318
You and me both,
the smug fucking bastards.

27:03.323 --> 27:04.018
See you later.

27:04.138 --> 27:05.845
See you later.

27:08.804 --> 27:11.103
Just been talking about your lot.

27:11.108 --> 27:12.713
My lot?

27:12.715 --> 27:15.845
I mean, I know you're always
in the limelight and on telly,

27:15.848 --> 27:18.113
but fucking hell,
do you ever stop rubbing it in?

27:18.114 --> 27:21.449
A glorious history
and all that shite.

27:21.451 --> 27:25.844
Do us all a favour
and shut the fuck up for a bit, eh?

27:29.348 --> 27:31.169
Fuck that.

27:32.557 --> 27:34.422
I'm not drinking in here.

27:34.423 --> 27:35.857
What's happened?

27:35.858 --> 27:38.169
Us lot are just off home, Mimi.

27:38.172 --> 27:40.448
And good fuckin' riddance, eh!

27:44.016 --> 27:45.576
Jackson...

28:11.953 --> 28:15.041
Carl.
Look, I'm sorry, right.

28:15.161 --> 28:16.561
Carl, what the fuck...?

28:16.566 --> 28:20.720
I just need for you to know that
it wasn't me that fucked up your business.

28:31.454 --> 28:33.169
Right. Let's start.
I need to go. Business.

28:33.175 --> 28:34.893
Can it wait? Can't.

28:34.894 --> 28:36.272
It's going to have to.

28:36.274 --> 28:39.620
This is a family meeting, yeah?
Shouldn't we wait for Micky?

28:39.623 --> 28:43.322
He's even less fucking use than you.
Can we get this over with?

28:43.327 --> 28:44.602
Right.

28:44.604 --> 28:48.223
She was handing these out
in the pub.

28:48.224 --> 28:53.754
"Your chance to appear in your own
porno as 'Kelly Does Chatsworth'.

28:53.762 --> 28:57.279
"I need 50
of the hardest men I can find,

28:57.288 --> 29:02.284
"and I mean hard,
to make my dream come true.

29:02.293 --> 29:04.319
"Do you measure up?"

29:04.326 --> 29:08.366
You were handing these out
in the pub?

29:08.373 --> 29:12.299
Paddy was selling smack
to kids a few years back.

29:12.304 --> 29:14.865
You were dealing weed
from your own front door!

29:14.868 --> 29:18.157
I wasn't sticking me arse
out of it and charging a tenner

29:18.160 --> 29:20.971
for it to be filled, was I?
Did you know about this?

29:20.975 --> 29:23.377
If you mean did I ask
his permission, no, I didn't.

29:23.380 --> 29:26.294
It's been a bit difficult
trying to make ends meet.

29:26.299 --> 29:27.579
It's been fucking impossible

29:27.699 --> 29:29.524
and it's been made worse by the fact

29:29.566 --> 29:32.383
that we've been getting ripped off
by so-called family.

29:34.981 --> 29:36.893
Kermit.

29:36.898 --> 29:39.856
It can't be. I counted it myself.

29:39.867 --> 29:44.487
No, I'm not calling you a liar.
Carl wouldn't do that.

29:44.495 --> 29:47.306
Ah, look, I'm on me way.
I'll sort it. 15 minutes, yeah?

29:47.314 --> 29:49.067
Who've you been upsetting now?

29:51.047 --> 29:52.828
Carl made a drop to Kermit.

29:53.239 --> 29:54.795
It's down two K.
He won't do business now.

29:54.915 --> 29:56.348
Carl's ripped us off.

29:56.351 --> 29:58.059
I'll kill the little fucker.

30:12.991 --> 30:18.567
My bird walked out on us, yeah?
Left us in a right Jeremy Kyle.

30:18.574 --> 30:22.864
Yeah, I have to sell me arse now
just to keep her in nappies.

30:22.870 --> 30:25.078
Yeah, you like that, don't you?

30:25.086 --> 30:27.533
Yeah, got you nice and hard, has it?

30:27.537 --> 30:29.279
You've cum already?

30:29.285 --> 30:31.448
I hadn't even got started.

30:31.452 --> 30:34.252
We are sitting on a gold mine here,
I'm telling you.

30:34.260 --> 30:36.901
A few more days,
it'd set you up for life.

30:36.915 --> 30:37.672
Reckon?

30:37.783 --> 30:40.001
We cleared over a grand in two days.

30:40.121 --> 30:43.418
Another week and you'd be able to
buy that car you've had your eye on.

30:43.421 --> 30:45.469
Fortnight in Spain next summer.

30:45.480 --> 30:47.153
Nice trackie, trainers.

30:47.154 --> 30:48.918
Babe magnet. Yeah?

30:48.926 --> 30:50.850
More pussy than a cat's home, mate.

30:54.124 --> 30:57.638
Yeah, lick my Adidas, you piece
of shit. You want it, don't you?

30:57.688 --> 30:59.303
I do indeed.
Desperate for it.

30:59.306 --> 31:01.680
I'm partial to a pilchard,
but I wouldn't say I was desperate.

31:01.800 --> 31:04.462
You want to stick it
up my nice, tight, virgin arse.

31:04.582 --> 31:06.726
No, I'm going to stick it
on a cracker.

31:06.846 --> 31:09.548
But if you give me a bit more notice when
you're up for a bit of kink,

31:09.668 --> 31:12.202
I'll gladly oblige.

31:16.823 --> 31:18.462
He hasn't been home.

31:18.463 --> 31:21.956
He'll have been out spilling
his seed, just like his father.

31:21.957 --> 31:25.587
My Brendan was the same. Spilling
it everywhere, just like a hose.

31:25.596 --> 31:27.190
Ruined the Axminster.

31:27.192 --> 31:30.947
Had his prostrate whizzed out,
that put a stop to it.

31:30.958 --> 31:35.305
Then Rodney took over where his father left
off, spilling it left, right and centre.

31:35.314 --> 31:39.206
It's such a persistent stain,
isn't it?

31:39.211 --> 31:42.032
Well, I'm starting to worry.

31:42.033 --> 31:44.787
What if he misses
his own birthday party?

31:44.792 --> 31:46.795
He's not a child.

31:46.804 --> 31:48.238
It's a Gallagher thing.

31:48.244 --> 31:51.772
All the men try and do a runner
before any celebration.

31:56.046 --> 31:58.185
Can I have a hand here, please?

31:58.196 --> 32:01.324
Unless, of course,
there's a free bar.

32:01.325 --> 32:03.488
Eh?

32:24.652 --> 32:27.527
There's not many places
you can hide in a car like this.

32:27.562 --> 32:28.766
Get the fuck off!

32:30.462 --> 32:34.468
Jackson's running late. He's
dropping Letitia off at a friend's.

32:34.477 --> 32:36.219
I hope you like this.

32:36.222 --> 32:37.418
Why wouldn't we?

32:37.419 --> 32:38.815
Don't think curry's
too heavy for lunch, do you?

32:38.935 --> 32:40.900
Stop worrying.

32:40.906 --> 32:43.356
It's just that your fella's
not that easy to impress.

32:43.476 --> 32:46.344
So why try?
Who cares what he thinks?

32:46.464 --> 32:47.430
I do.

32:47.550 --> 32:49.874
There's one thing
you should know about Jackson.

32:50.270 --> 32:55.930
He's a good man and I love him,
but he can be a complete wanker.

32:55.931 --> 32:59.357
At least he knows his own mind and
stands up for what he believes in.

33:00.972 --> 33:05.114
All right,
all right, calm down, calm down.

33:05.121 --> 33:07.045
Is right, Mimi, girl?

33:07.049 --> 33:11.645
Buzzin', laughin',
toffee apple, kidda! Eh?

33:11.646 --> 33:16.027
The money wasn't there.
He was going to cut my fingers off.

33:16.036 --> 33:19.473
Strip. What?

33:19.481 --> 33:20.836
I said strip.

33:28.101 --> 33:31.595
I didn't take the cash, Jamie.
I know it's hard for you to believe

33:31.599 --> 33:34.854
but I didn't, I wouldn't!
It's not in my nature.

33:36.669 --> 33:40.834
You put your faith in me, why the fuck
would I chuck it back in your face?

33:44.248 --> 33:45.114
Get in the car.

33:46.287 --> 33:47.347
Please, Jamie.

33:47.467 --> 33:49.244
Get in the fucking car!

33:49.364 --> 33:50.371
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

33:50.376 --> 33:51.765
Man up, Carl.

33:53.695 --> 33:55.960
Come on!

33:55.962 --> 34:00.491
I'm not a man. I'm just a kid.
I don't want to go with you.

34:05.717 --> 34:08.972
My cock's as thick as a beer can
and it wants your hole.

34:08.976 --> 34:11.656
The hardest scally on the streets,
that's who this is,

34:11.775 --> 34:14.891
now touch your
toes and spread those butt cheeks.

34:15.012 --> 34:17.560
Who?

34:17.565 --> 34:22.596
But I've got a jock strap on
and I'm just back from the match.

34:24.266 --> 34:26.804
I've got an eight-inch throbber.

34:26.813 --> 34:28.407
He wants you.

34:31.187 --> 34:35.568
I told you before, you filthy
little fucker, lick my boots clean.

34:35.577 --> 34:39.036
I want every fuckin' stud gleamin'

34:39.045 --> 34:42.687
and when you've done that, I
want your mouth around my toes.

34:42.692 --> 34:46.583
Nice one. Any time, mate. Yeah, bye.

34:49.125 --> 34:51.424
It just rots the soul, dunnit?

34:51.428 --> 34:53.112
You know, zaps your aura.

34:53.114 --> 34:54.446
It's good money.

34:54.456 --> 34:57.405
It can't be good for you, you know,
absorbing that day after day.

34:57.407 --> 35:00.332
It blurs your moral boundaries.

35:00.339 --> 35:05.426
It's corrupted and it's making me
feel sick talking to those perverts.

35:05.435 --> 35:10.055
Fuck's sake, Micky. If it's getting to you
that much, let's just call it a day.

35:10.066 --> 35:12.957
They're human beings, you know.

35:18.519 --> 35:21.535
Fuck off, filth! Urgh!

35:22.939 --> 35:25.329
I think you owe Mimi an apology.

35:25.334 --> 35:29.044
I think she owes me one.
All that shit about 'your lot'

35:29.053 --> 35:30.918
and 'our glorious history'.

35:30.919 --> 35:32.933
Hundreds of years of
oppression and she...

35:32.944 --> 35:37.086
Hang on! When I said 'your lot'
I meant Man United supporters!

35:37.093 --> 35:40.745
Who the fucking hell did you
think I was talking about?

35:40.746 --> 35:44.046
Jackson got it into his head
you were insulting...

35:46.873 --> 35:49.127
'us lot'.

35:49.132 --> 35:51.977
How fucking dare you!

35:51.981 --> 35:55.906
So you get into the comedy Scouse
gear to get your own back?

35:55.917 --> 35:57.386
I was illustrating a point.

35:57.391 --> 36:01.659
That Scousers are all
trackie-wearing, curly-headed scum?

36:01.667 --> 36:04.729
No, that it's a misconception.

36:04.731 --> 36:09.646
The same as black people eating
curried goat out of a wooden bowl.

36:09.647 --> 36:11.992
Do you know how hard it is
to find goat?

36:16.651 --> 36:19.109
I go out of my way
to provide an authentic meal.

36:19.111 --> 36:21.057
I'm not a lover of goat.

36:23.883 --> 36:26.922
You're right, he IS a wanker.

36:26.929 --> 36:30.776
Well, you can take your
sneery, half smile and fuck off.

36:30.779 --> 36:35.012
And I'll flush that
bag of skunk I bought.

36:35.020 --> 36:37.808
Wouldn't want tooffend.

36:40.092 --> 36:42.016
Who's offended?

36:49.636 --> 36:51.116
I've got the money.

36:53.321 --> 36:55.984
It's not just
about the money, Jamie.

36:58.798 --> 37:00.915
I said I'd slip you some extra.

37:00.918 --> 37:02.933
Call it compensation.

37:04.220 --> 37:08.476
Your little rookie's not
leaving here without a fucking mark.

37:13.606 --> 37:15.609
You'll take the cash

37:15.613 --> 37:18.003
and leave me to sort him. You got it?

37:18.007 --> 37:19.931
Come on, you think you've lost face?

37:19.937 --> 37:21.963
What about me?

37:21.965 --> 37:25.539
Done over by someone I had ambition
for. Someone I gave a chance to.

37:25.540 --> 37:27.315
Someone I trusted.

37:27.326 --> 37:29.398
I've got something lined up for
Carl, don't you worry about that.

37:36.821 --> 37:37.687
Put that on.

37:41.991 --> 37:43.915
Blindfold, you tit.

38:21.308 --> 38:22.426
No, Jamie.

38:22.546 --> 38:23.473
Any last words, Carl?

38:23.593 --> 38:24.579
No.

38:31.141 --> 38:33.156
Please, Jamie.

38:37.075 --> 38:38.965
The birthday boy's here.

38:46.539 --> 38:47.927
Keep it together, bud.

38:47.928 --> 38:49.601
Mate, I think I've
just pissed a bit.

38:49.608 --> 38:50.948
You owe me.

38:51.068 --> 38:54.179
'Ey. Happy birthday!

38:57.887 --> 38:59.788
What's up with him?

38:59.790 --> 39:00.747
He's overcome.

39:00.753 --> 39:01.971
We were worried sick.

39:01.973 --> 39:03.339
Did you do all this?

39:03.341 --> 39:07.040
We helped out
but Jamie organised everything.

39:07.043 --> 39:10.571
Couldn't let me mate down
on his birthday now, could I?

39:15.502 --> 39:19.804
The only decent thing to
come out of Manchester is the M62.

39:19.809 --> 39:22.233
And the greatest
football team in the land.

39:22.239 --> 39:23.480
Wayne Rooney.

39:23.487 --> 39:24.296
Oasis.

39:24.304 --> 39:25.658
Lennon wannabes.

39:25.689 --> 39:27.547
What about inflicting
fucking Cilla on us?

39:27.667 --> 39:29.265
Mick fucking Hucknall.

39:29.385 --> 39:31.343
Liverpool was a city
built on slavery.

39:31.346 --> 39:33.418
I never dragged anyone
out the jungle.

39:33.420 --> 39:35.105
Sins of the fathers.

39:35.112 --> 39:36.911
What about sins of your fathers?

39:36.920 --> 39:39.174
Some of them chiefs sold their own.

39:39.182 --> 39:42.777
The black race have had to live
through centuries of oppression.

39:42.788 --> 39:44.894
I'm a woman, black.

39:44.895 --> 39:46.978
Scouse, black.

39:46.984 --> 39:49.135
Fat, black.

39:49.139 --> 39:52.485
Working class, black.

39:52.489 --> 39:56.950
And where were you when my ancestors
were starving to death back in Ireland!

39:56.959 --> 39:59.600
So don't talk to me
about perse-fucking-cution!

40:09.502 --> 40:12.164
We'll take your presents
back to the house.

40:12.165 --> 40:15.465
You can't trust this thieving lot.

40:15.473 --> 40:17.567
All the best, son.

40:17.569 --> 40:20.266
Now that you're 21,
if you need any advice on women...

40:20.271 --> 40:22.024
You cheeky twat.

40:25.299 --> 40:26.904
There you go, son.

40:26.909 --> 40:31.541
I just wanted to say
a few words on this special day.

40:31.545 --> 40:33.844
I've got something for you.

40:33.851 --> 40:37.186
Seems like only yesterday...

40:44.479 --> 40:47.370
We didn't know what to get you
so we got you these.

40:47.379 --> 40:49.917
Happy birthday.

40:49.920 --> 40:56.213
Listen, I really appreciate this,
girls but, I'm spoken for so..

41:06.260 --> 41:07.660
Took your fuckin' time.

41:07.666 --> 41:08.839
I'm out.

41:08.845 --> 41:11.224
You mean Jamie pushed you out.

41:11.233 --> 41:14.124
My decision to walk.

41:14.129 --> 41:15.529
Sure you've done the right thing?

41:15.536 --> 41:19.007
Absolutely. I've had my
wings clipped for too long.

41:19.012 --> 41:21.596
Feel like I can fly with you.

41:21.599 --> 41:24.160
You don't half talk shit sometimes.

41:24.164 --> 41:27.055
Go back now and kiss and make up.

41:27.058 --> 41:30.164
Ah, ah, ah, you wanted bollocks.

41:30.175 --> 41:32.736
Don't do this for me.

41:32.737 --> 41:34.307
I am doing this

41:34.318 --> 41:38.961
for me.
And we are better on our own.

41:38.966 --> 41:42.596
Whatever we earn is ours.
Just me and you, babe.

41:42.599 --> 41:44.978
Bonnie and fuckin' Clyde, eh?

42:01.903 --> 42:07.707
We're all just standing around
stroking our cocks for the games teacher.

42:07.709 --> 42:08.495
You were doing so well.

42:14.526 --> 42:16.768
I'm sorry about last night.

42:16.777 --> 42:18.587
Last night?

42:19.985 --> 42:23.763
You wouldn't believe me if I told
you. Didn't wait long, did you?

42:23.764 --> 42:25.995
I didn't wait at all.

42:25.999 --> 42:27.251
I wasn't there.

42:27.259 --> 42:28.716
We made a date.

42:28.720 --> 42:31.702
You made a date.
I had other arrangements.

42:33.436 --> 42:35.883
Those girls are more your type.

42:37.970 --> 42:39.461
Enjoy your evening.

42:49.857 --> 42:52.839
Come on, Lils, get down!

42:54.745 --> 42:56.635
Had a good night?

42:56.640 --> 42:58.427
Yeah, thanks, Jamie.

42:58.434 --> 43:01.824
Listen,
I'm sorry, I thought you were...

43:01.825 --> 43:04.056
in the car with the blindfold.

43:04.064 --> 43:07.694
Fucking hell, Carl.
I'm still two grand down, though.

43:07.698 --> 43:09.905
You're going to have
to work that off.

43:09.916 --> 43:12.227
I thought you would've wanted rid.

43:15.160 --> 43:16.025
I took it.

43:16.036 --> 43:16.731
You did what?

43:16.736 --> 43:18.409
Well, it works for everyone else.

43:18.413 --> 43:22.088
I took what was ours.
You wouldn't hand it over, so

43:22.089 --> 43:24.455
I took it.
And you're not getting an apology

43:24.466 --> 43:27.857
and you're not getting it back.
It was ours. Wasn't it, Shane?

43:27.865 --> 43:29.982
Do you know
what trouble you've caused?

43:29.988 --> 43:31.673
Wasn't it, Shane?

43:32.575 --> 43:33.987
Shane...

43:42.164 --> 43:44.099
I won't fuck it up again.

43:45.290 --> 43:46.679
I know you won't.

43:51.707 --> 43:54.449
Oh, leave him in his own vomit.

43:54.450 --> 43:55.998
What if he chokes?

43:56.001 --> 43:59.267
Throw a tablecloth over him.
He'll be fine.

44:14.445 --> 44:16.244
I've joined the family business.

44:16.248 --> 44:21.255
Well, that is funny, Carl,
because I just left.

44:21.471 --> 44:22.951
I hope you know what
you're getting yourself into.

44:22.956 --> 44:25.789
The only fucking job round
here with any prospects.

44:25.790 --> 44:27.793
You're a dickhead, Carl.

44:27.801 --> 44:30.567
A stupid, naive, little prick,

44:30.568 --> 44:34.562
who's just made the biggest mistake
of his life.

44:38.303 --> 44:39.328
And how's that?

44:39.335 --> 44:40.747
You'll see.

44:42.707 --> 44:47.691
'So your garden might not be all
stripy lawns and blossom trees.

44:47.699 --> 44:50.214
'Could be full of thorns.

44:50.221 --> 44:53.715
'Hidden dangers. But chances are
you'll know all about them.

45:00.957 --> 45:04.144
'21 years in this garden,
this shithole,

45:04.152 --> 45:06.337
'this little plot of earth.

45:06.338 --> 45:10.879
'And I want 21 one more.

45:10.885 --> 45:14.254
'And I want to spend
each and every one of 'em...

45:15.823 --> 45:18.873
'right here.'

45:18.884 --> 45:20.738
I thought we'd agreed,
no more robbing. Got to give

45:20.749 --> 45:22.661
the new business a chance.
First big earner, and you

45:22.662 --> 45:24.608
wanna go running back for help?

45:24.609 --> 45:27.033
Little bird told me you
might be in a spot of bother.

45:27.153 --> 45:28.686
Don't you see they're using you?

45:28.763 --> 45:31.086
You need to be more gentle with
the clutch. But on the whole,

45:31.087 --> 45:33.657
some improvement. I just provide
space to let their hair down.

45:33.777 --> 45:34.694
And their knickers.

45:34.702 --> 45:36.239
Who's gonna hurt cheeky Ches?

45:36.242 --> 45:38.132
Get down on the floor!

45:38.140 --> 45:39.666
Stay down!

45:40.935 --> 45:43.530
Another half hour,
unless you want to pay for more.
