Hello, and welcome to Mock the Week.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.090
I'm Dara O Briain
and joining me this week are

00:37.090 --> 00:40.080
Ed Byrne, Kerry Godliman
and Ed Gamble,

00:40.080 --> 00:42.060
Larry Dean, Hugh Dennis
and Angela Barnes.

00:42.060 --> 00:44.060
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:49.010 --> 00:50.080
We start with a round tonight called

00:50.080 --> 00:52.070
If This is the Answer,
What is the Question?

00:52.070 --> 00:54.020
On the board are six categories.

00:54.020 --> 00:56.010
Larry, which category
would you like?

00:56.010 --> 00:57.060
World News, please.

00:57.060 --> 00:59.030
Your topic is World News.

00:59.030 --> 01:01.000
The answer is...

01:01.000 --> 01:02.020
What is the question?

01:02.020 --> 01:04.040
"How many items of
shopping does it take

01:04.040 --> 01:07.060
"before a Scottish person
pays 5p for a bag?"

01:07.060 --> 01:10.010
LAUGHTER

01:10.010 --> 01:12.080
Is it, "Take the number of
people that think Theresa May

01:12.080 --> 01:15.090
"is doing a good job
and multiply it by 27"?

01:15.090 --> 01:18.030
LAUGHTER

01:18.030 --> 01:21.070
APPLAUSE

01:21.070 --> 01:24.020
Is it, "How many kisses can
you put at the end of a text to

01:24.020 --> 01:27.060
"your sister's boyfriend before he
asks her to ask what you're doing?"

01:27.060 --> 01:29.080
LAUGHTER

01:29.080 --> 01:33.010
Is it, "How many dresses are
there in the film 27 Dresses?"

01:33.010 --> 01:35.040
LAUGHTER

01:35.040 --> 01:38.000
Is it, "When the Bodyguard
was on BBC One on Sunday night,

01:38.000 --> 01:40.070
"how many people were
watching Channel 5?"

01:40.070 --> 01:42.050
LAUGHTER

01:42.050 --> 01:46.010
Is it, "How many chameleons
snuck onto the Ark?"

01:46.010 --> 01:48.040
LAUGHTER

01:48.040 --> 01:51.020
That would explain why they're
bloody everywhere now, aren't they?

01:51.020 --> 01:52.080
Tons of them.

01:52.080 --> 01:54.080
Is it, "How old, in years,
is my oldest bra?"

01:54.080 --> 01:57.010
LAUGHTER

01:57.010 --> 01:59.040
Is it, "What is the
average life expectancy

01:59.040 --> 02:01.060
"in the event of a no-deal Brexit?"

02:01.060 --> 02:03.020
LAUGHTER

02:03.020 --> 02:07.080
AUDIENCE GROANS
That's fairly Project Fear,
I think that is.

02:07.080 --> 02:10.000
All right, Jacob, calm down.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Is it, "What's my life expectancy?"

02:12.000 --> 02:15.010
LAUGHTER

02:15.010 --> 02:18.040
"What did I lose my job as a
bingo caller for referring to

02:18.040 --> 02:20.090
"as, 'one duck being shot
in the back of the head'?"

02:20.090 --> 02:24.060
LAUGHTER

02:24.060 --> 02:28.050
Is it, "How many times will
Jeremy Corbyn need to be circumcised

02:28.050 --> 02:31.010
"before Jewish people forgive him?"

02:31.010 --> 02:32.090
LAUGHTER

02:32.090 --> 02:36.060
"How old do I feel
with new Actinium Plus?"

02:36.060 --> 02:39.040
LAUGHTER

02:39.040 --> 02:43.020
"How old was the farmer wearing
Ed's waistcoat when he died?"

02:43.020 --> 02:45.060
LAUGHTER

02:45.060 --> 02:48.010
APPLAUSE In 1862.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.080
Well, all I can say is, Mr Gamble,

02:52.080 --> 02:55.070
I hope you get the weather
you're hoping for.

02:55.070 --> 02:57.000
LAUGHTER

02:57.000 --> 02:58.080
If I can have the
right answer, please...

02:58.080 --> 03:01.040
Is it, "How many EU countries

03:01.040 --> 03:04.080
"rejected Britain's
plans for Brexit?"

03:04.080 --> 03:06.080
Of course it is.
Thank you very much, Hugh.

03:06.080 --> 03:08.080
APPLAUSE

03:10.070 --> 03:13.090
Yes, it is to do with the number of
countries in the EU specifically.

03:13.090 --> 03:16.010
"How many European Union
member states

03:16.010 --> 03:19.060
rejected Prime Minister
Theresa May's plans for Brexit?"

03:19.060 --> 03:21.060
What do you think of
the EU leaders' response

03:21.060 --> 03:24.010
to Theresa May's Chequers plan?
It's not a surprise, is it?

03:24.010 --> 03:25.080
She knew they were
going to reject it

03:25.080 --> 03:27.090
but she went there on
a sort of charm offensive.

03:27.090 --> 03:31.030
But she's Theresa May so she
decided just to do without the charm

03:31.030 --> 03:33.040
and just really double down
on the offensive.

03:33.040 --> 03:35.030
LAUGHTER

03:35.030 --> 03:37.040
She's always got the look of someone

03:37.040 --> 03:40.000
that's selling dodgy electrical
gear at a car-boot sale.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.090
LAUGHTER

03:41.090 --> 03:44.040
I can't watch it any more.
I just find it too cringey,

03:44.040 --> 03:46.080
just watching all the EU leaders
get on well apart from her.

03:46.080 --> 03:49.020
She just... She reminds me
too much of what I was like

03:49.020 --> 03:50.070
in secondary school at a party.

03:50.070 --> 03:52.060
I think you're expecting,
in a minute,

03:52.060 --> 03:55.010
she's going to look at
the EU's CD collection.

03:55.010 --> 03:57.090
LAUGHTER

03:57.090 --> 04:01.040
Just in a corner somewhere
going, "Oh, yeah..."

04:01.040 --> 04:02.090
I thought about this the other day.

04:02.090 --> 04:04.070
Like, "What are we going
to be talking about

04:04.070 --> 04:06.040
"when we're not talking
about Brexit?"

04:06.040 --> 04:08.080
And then I thought, "We're
not going to have time to talk.

04:08.080 --> 04:09.090
"We'll be too busy

04:09.090 --> 04:12.030
"mugging old ladies for their
penicillin prescriptions."

04:12.030 --> 04:13.060
LAUGHTER

04:13.060 --> 04:16.040
Here's the three main things that
I'm worried about in the trade deal.

04:16.040 --> 04:18.079
OK. Orangina, Pom-Bears
and French kissing.

04:18.079 --> 04:21.040
LAUGHTER

04:21.040 --> 04:22.079
In that order.

04:22.079 --> 04:25.080
If we can secure all those things,
I'm happy to go ahead with Chequers.

04:25.080 --> 04:27.080
LAUGHTER

04:27.080 --> 04:30.010
Well, one of them is that
it might affect flights

04:30.010 --> 04:31.070
to other EU countries.

04:31.070 --> 04:33.090
And again, I just think that's
going to be the last thing

04:33.090 --> 04:35.080
we're worried about
under a no-deal Brexit

04:35.080 --> 04:37.020
when we're, you know, too busy

04:37.020 --> 04:39.000
sucking off a greengrocer
for a cabbage.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.090
LAUGHTER
In the first morning? Surely...

04:41.090 --> 04:47.010
Let us get to the end of the week
before we have to fellate retailers

04:47.010 --> 04:48.050
just to get basic provisions.

04:48.050 --> 04:50.080
Why didn't the Remain campaign
put that on a bus?

04:50.080 --> 04:53.020
LAUGHTER

04:53.020 --> 04:55.040
Because I'd be scared about
the amount of people...

04:55.040 --> 04:57.080
A picture of a hearty greengrocer
holding a cabbage,

04:57.080 --> 04:59.080
going, "What will you do for this?

04:59.080 --> 05:03.060
"What will you do to get your
hands on this after Brexit?"

05:03.060 --> 05:05.040
I mean, that raises
a lot of questions.

05:05.040 --> 05:07.090
The first being, "How much do
you like cabbage, Angela?"

05:07.090 --> 05:09.020
LAUGHTER

05:09.020 --> 05:10.090
I'd have done that
maybe for a cauliflower

05:10.090 --> 05:12.010
but I'm not sure for a cabbage.

05:12.010 --> 05:15.050
No, I really like
sucking off greengrocers.
LAUGHTER

05:15.050 --> 05:18.020
Well, that's an upside
anyway, I suppose.

05:18.020 --> 05:20.090
SOLEMNLY: You're lucky if
you can find one these days.

05:20.090 --> 05:23.020
Tell me about it, Hugh.

05:23.020 --> 05:26.000
This is the most English
conversation ever.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.030
OK, sucking off chip-shop owners.

05:28.030 --> 05:30.050
LAUGHTER

05:30.050 --> 05:33.010
Will someone tell Larry
what a cabbage is?

05:33.010 --> 05:35.000
It's pet passports
as well, isn't it?

05:35.000 --> 05:37.010
Pet passports is a huge thing. Oh!

05:37.010 --> 05:39.060
You might have to wait up to
three months to get a pet passport.

05:39.060 --> 05:41.040
So, you have to plan, won't you?
Yes.

05:41.040 --> 05:43.040
That's going to take
all the spontaneity

05:43.040 --> 05:45.060
out of a holiday
with Rover, isn't it?

05:45.060 --> 05:48.000
The old carpe diem weekend
in Brussels.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.040
I mean, three months
doesn't sound like a long time,

05:50.040 --> 05:52.010
but in dog years...

05:52.010 --> 05:53.080
DARA GASPS

05:53.080 --> 05:55.030
How are they going to implement it?

05:55.030 --> 05:57.020
Is there going to be,
like, a bin at security

05:57.020 --> 05:59.070
where you throw your guinea pig?

05:59.070 --> 06:01.040
LAUGHTER

06:01.040 --> 06:03.060
Or you can bag them up
in a clear plastic bag.

06:03.060 --> 06:05.010
LAUGHTER

06:05.010 --> 06:07.020
You don't need them for guinea...
No, you don't.

06:07.020 --> 06:09.040
There are only three pets
you need them for... Yes.

06:09.040 --> 06:10.080
..which are dogs, cats...

06:10.080 --> 06:12.060
..and ferrets. Why?

06:12.060 --> 06:14.030
That's going to
affect TENS of people!

06:14.030 --> 06:15.060
LAUGHTER

06:15.060 --> 06:18.040
I've never sat beside somebody
who's bringing a ferret on holiday.

06:18.040 --> 06:20.090
It would just be an hour of
sitting by somebody

06:20.090 --> 06:23.090
who's just doing this with a ferret,
running over their hands.

06:23.090 --> 06:25.020
LAUGHTER

06:25.020 --> 06:27.000
You look like you're
doing t'ai chi, Dara.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.030
I am. It's very good.
It's very centring.

06:29.030 --> 06:32.000
I hate to be a doom-monger here
but, you know,

06:32.000 --> 06:34.020
in the event of a no-deal Brexit,

06:34.020 --> 06:36.080
we're not going to be worried
about taking our pets on holiday

06:36.080 --> 06:39.050
because we will have eaten them
out of desperation.

06:39.050 --> 06:40.070
LAUGHTER

06:40.070 --> 06:42.080
Yeah, and with a side serving
of cabbage.

06:42.080 --> 06:44.030
LAUGHTER

06:44.030 --> 06:46.070
I wondering if people
are now going to smuggle

06:46.070 --> 06:48.000
their pets over the borders,

06:48.000 --> 06:50.060
and then we're going to have
to use drugs to sniff them out.

06:50.060 --> 06:52.070
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

06:57.080 --> 07:00.080
Just going,
"Rover, keep calm, keep calm."

07:00.080 --> 07:04.020
Walking past, there's a big line
of coke all the way to the end.

07:04.020 --> 07:06.000
"Anything to declare, Monsieur?"

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
"No."

07:07.000 --> 07:09.030
The hat's jumping wildly
on your head.

07:09.030 --> 07:11.020
HE MAKES ANIMAL NOISES

07:11.020 --> 07:12.070
Jumping furiously.

07:12.070 --> 07:14.040
I'm Type 1 diabetic and, genuinely,

07:14.040 --> 07:17.040
the majority of synthetic insulin
is made in mainland Europe,

07:17.040 --> 07:19.070
and there might be problems
with importing that.

07:19.070 --> 07:24.030
So, I've genuinely now
started stockpiling insulin

07:24.030 --> 07:27.090
so, after Brexit, I can sell it
to more desperate diabetics.

07:27.090 --> 07:30.070
LAUGHTER

07:30.070 --> 07:34.010
APPLAUSE

07:34.010 --> 07:35.050
In other news, what was revealed

07:35.050 --> 07:37.030
about the so-called
Croydon Cat Killer?

07:37.030 --> 07:39.020
Well, it was a fox, wasn't it?

07:39.020 --> 07:42.060
What, a really sexy cat killer?

07:42.060 --> 07:44.070
It was a combination of foxes.

07:44.070 --> 07:48.000
They reckon it was actually
just cats getting hit by cars,

07:48.000 --> 07:50.010
and then foxes eating their heads.

07:50.010 --> 07:52.010
LAUGHTER

07:52.010 --> 07:53.060
The police came in for criticism

07:53.060 --> 07:55.040
cos they'd spent thousands of pounds

07:55.040 --> 07:57.080
trying to track down the
human killer of all these cats.

07:57.080 --> 08:00.040
Yeah. The notion was that this
was a potential serial killer

08:00.040 --> 08:03.000
just learning how to be
a serial killer by attacking cats.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.080
Hang on. Why would there
be any indication

08:04.080 --> 08:06.040
that it is a potential
serial killer?

08:06.040 --> 08:08.050
Cos, a lot of the time,
they do start off with animals,

08:08.050 --> 08:09.080
on a serious note. Is that true?

08:09.080 --> 08:11.060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But it's a waste of time

08:11.060 --> 08:14.000
cos they spent thousands of pounds
and it turns out to be a fox -

08:14.000 --> 08:16.030
but they got the killer,
didn't they? They found...

08:16.030 --> 08:18.080
There wasn't a photo coming
with the story of a fox

08:18.080 --> 08:22.060
with his little paws behind his
back going, "Yeah, yeah."

08:22.060 --> 08:24.020
LAUGHTER

08:24.020 --> 08:26.010
"And I'd do it again!"

08:26.010 --> 08:29.060
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

08:29.060 --> 08:32.059
They said that the
remains had been... by foxes.

08:32.059 --> 08:35.059
They just didn't go,
"It's him again! It's him.

08:35.059 --> 08:37.059
"It's Reynard!"

08:37.059 --> 08:40.030
"You will never catch me! Ha-ha!"

08:40.030 --> 08:42.049
The... But it's a... It was that...

08:42.049 --> 08:44.070
There isn't "a" fox.
They haven't captured...

08:44.070 --> 08:46.070
No, but they did do their job,
didn't they?

08:46.070 --> 08:48.050
So, they're being
criticised for not...

08:48.050 --> 08:50.090
Well, no, only if you think if
someone walks into your house

08:50.090 --> 08:53.030
and goes, "We've investigated
your burglary and it was,

08:53.030 --> 08:55.030
"dun-dun-dun, a person!"

08:55.030 --> 08:56.080
LAUGHTER

08:56.080 --> 08:58.020
I think this is all...

08:58.020 --> 09:00.000
We're forgetting
that 400 cats died here,

09:00.000 --> 09:01.060
and what's really tragic about it is

09:01.060 --> 09:04.000
most of those cats
wouldn't have been there

09:04.000 --> 09:06.050
if they hadn't been still
waiting for their passports.

09:06.050 --> 09:10.070
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

09:10.070 --> 09:13.070
I think this is about
police cuts, basically.

09:13.070 --> 09:15.090
We're going to see more
crimes blamed on foxes.

09:15.090 --> 09:17.040
LAUGHTER

09:17.040 --> 09:19.040
It's a good way of covering
your tracks from now on.

09:19.040 --> 09:23.020
If you're going to commit a crime,
just leave a fox shit at the scene.

09:23.020 --> 09:26.000
LAUGHTER

09:26.000 --> 09:28.050
"Ha-ha! He has struck again!"

09:28.050 --> 09:30.040
LAUGHTER

09:30.040 --> 09:32.050
Does this apply for any crime,
by the way?

09:32.050 --> 09:34.000
Absolutely.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.060
Like the Hatton Garden robbery?

09:35.060 --> 09:37.000
LAUGHTER

09:37.000 --> 09:40.040
Going through to steal the diamonds,
do a tiny stool and, erm...

09:40.040 --> 09:42.000
You... What...? You... Did...?

09:42.000 --> 09:43.080
That's me trying to do a fox shit.

09:43.080 --> 09:45.060
LAUGHTER

09:45.060 --> 09:48.020
Dara, you've really gone
round the houses there.

09:48.020 --> 09:50.070
I was suggesting you source
some fox shit in the farm...

09:50.070 --> 09:52.040
Obviously you'd get some fox shit.

09:52.040 --> 09:55.040
Not go... Not try and shit
in the shape of fox shit!

09:55.040 --> 09:57.080
"I have been training my anus

09:57.080 --> 10:00.080
"and eating nothing
but cats' heads."

10:00.080 --> 10:02.060
LAUGHTER

10:02.060 --> 10:05.020
That would be a brilliant part...
A brilliant part of...

10:05.020 --> 10:07.030
You know the scene in
the heist movie where

10:07.030 --> 10:09.090
there's like,
"I'm the explosives guy."

10:09.090 --> 10:11.030
"I'm the computer guy.

10:11.030 --> 10:14.090
"I'll knock out the alarm system."

10:14.090 --> 10:16.050
"Well, I'm the guy
with the blackboard

10:16.050 --> 10:17.080
"who'll work out the driving."

10:17.080 --> 10:19.040
"What is HIS job?"

10:19.040 --> 10:21.060
"I shit like a fox."

10:21.060 --> 10:23.060
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

10:27.070 --> 10:31.060
OK. At the end of that round,
the points go to Ed, Kerry and Ed.

10:31.060 --> 10:35.070
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

10:35.070 --> 10:39.030
Now we play a round called
You Brexit, You Bought It.

10:39.030 --> 10:41.060
This game...
LAUGHTER

10:41.060 --> 10:43.030
..involves
Larry Dean and Ed Gamble.

10:43.030 --> 10:45.090
So, if you could make your way
to the performance area, please.

10:45.090 --> 10:47.040
This round is a stand-up challenge.

10:47.040 --> 10:50.000
I launch the Wheel of News,
and, wherever it chooses to stop,

10:50.000 --> 10:52.080
one of our performers must step
forward and talk about that subject.

10:52.080 --> 10:54.080
OK, here we go,
let's spin the wheel.

10:54.080 --> 10:56.030
The first subject is Travel.

10:59.040 --> 11:02.000
So, I was having a wank in Dubai...

11:02.000 --> 11:05.060
LAUGHTER

11:06.060 --> 11:10.010
APPLAUSE

11:10.010 --> 11:11.080
It wasn't planned.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.090
Well, most of them aren't, are they?

11:14.090 --> 11:17.000
I just was outside having some lunch

11:17.000 --> 11:20.030
and I lowered my cutlery
and went, "It's time."

11:21.070 --> 11:23.030
That's enough Vitamin D.

11:23.030 --> 11:25.060
Time for some Vitamin Me.

11:25.060 --> 11:28.030
LAUGHTER

11:28.030 --> 11:30.010
And I went up to my room, right?

11:30.010 --> 11:34.050
And I opened up my laptop
to watch some of the gay porn,

11:34.050 --> 11:36.050
cos I'm gay.

11:36.050 --> 11:39.000
I didn't need to clarify that,
did I?

11:39.000 --> 11:41.020
I don't think there's
anybody watching this,

11:41.020 --> 11:43.050
thinking, "Oh, he's straight
and he watches gay porn.

11:43.050 --> 11:46.010
"How progressive of him. Well done."

11:46.010 --> 11:48.070
So, I tried to watch some
of the gay porn, right?

11:48.070 --> 11:51.040
But I couldn't
cos the gay porn was blocked

11:51.040 --> 11:53.080
cos it's illegal
to be gay in Dubai -

11:53.080 --> 11:57.030
which is weird cos there is
gay bars in Dubai.

11:57.030 --> 11:58.060
Oh, not gay bars.

11:58.060 --> 12:00.060
Prisons.

12:00.060 --> 12:02.030
LAUGHTER

12:03.080 --> 12:06.060
So, since the gay porn was blocked,

12:06.060 --> 12:09.070
I had to watch some
of the straight stuff.

12:12.010 --> 12:14.080
Long-time listener,
first-time caller.

12:14.080 --> 12:18.040
LAUGHTER

12:18.040 --> 12:22.020
So, I was watching the straight,
amateur porn, right? And...

12:22.020 --> 12:24.040
Amateur as well,
cos amateur's better -

12:24.040 --> 12:26.010
cos when you watch amateur porn,

12:26.010 --> 12:28.070
there's a little bit of you
that thinks, "I can do that."

12:28.070 --> 12:30.040
LAUGHTER

12:30.040 --> 12:33.000
It gives you a good
self-esteem boost.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.060
Same reason why I
watch Scottish football.

12:35.060 --> 12:38.080
LAUGHTER

12:38.080 --> 12:41.090
And so, when I was doing my thing
over the straight stuff, right?

12:41.090 --> 12:44.030
A knock on the door
happened and I thought,

12:44.030 --> 12:47.020
"I'd better answer the door cos they
might have a key to the room."

12:47.020 --> 12:51.020
So, I got up quickly and I put
my willy down in between my legs,

12:51.020 --> 12:52.080
into stealth mode.

12:52.080 --> 12:54.050
LAUGHTER

12:54.050 --> 12:56.000
And I pulled my trousers up,

12:56.000 --> 12:59.020
and I started walking
towards the door, like that.

12:59.020 --> 13:03.020
And I opened up the door,
and a guy was just standing there,

13:03.020 --> 13:07.080
and he handed me a chocolate bar
and then walked away.

13:07.080 --> 13:11.040
I still do not know,
to this day, why he did that.

13:11.040 --> 13:14.020
I've never been so
confused in my whole life.

13:14.020 --> 13:16.090
Cos I took the chocolate bar
off him and I shut the door,

13:16.090 --> 13:18.080
and I started walking round
the room thinking,

13:18.080 --> 13:21.040
"Oh, my God,
maybe there's a camera in here."

13:21.040 --> 13:23.000
LAUGHTER

13:23.000 --> 13:25.020
They've seen me
watching straight porn

13:25.020 --> 13:28.030
and now they're training me,
like a dog, to do it again.

13:28.030 --> 13:30.040
LAUGHTER

13:30.040 --> 13:32.080
APPLAUSE

13:32.080 --> 13:34.040
OK, that leaves us with Ed.

13:34.040 --> 13:35.060
Let's see what your topic is.

13:35.060 --> 13:37.000
Let's spin the wheel.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
And the topic is Diet.

13:41.000 --> 13:45.040
So, my last job was handing out
chocolate bars in a Dubai hotel.

13:45.040 --> 13:50.040
LAUGHTER

13:50.040 --> 13:52.060
APPLAUSE
I try and stay healthy.

13:52.060 --> 13:55.010
I listen to all the wrong people
about health, though.

13:55.010 --> 13:56.050
I started reading health blogs.

13:56.050 --> 13:59.010
Like health bloggers - they're
always the same sorts of people.

13:59.010 --> 14:01.050
They're sort of posh, young women
in their early twenties.

14:01.050 --> 14:03.060
They say things like,
"First thing in the morning,

14:03.060 --> 14:06.020
"to energise yourself,
why not have hot water and lemon?"

14:06.020 --> 14:07.090
Hot water and lemon to energise.

14:07.090 --> 14:11.020
There is no way hot water and lemon
is energising me in the morning.

14:11.020 --> 14:13.050
The only way that
would happen would be

14:13.050 --> 14:16.040
if I squeezed the lemon in my eye
and poured the water on my dick.

14:16.040 --> 14:18.080
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

14:18.080 --> 14:20.080
I do not want your
hot water and lemon

14:20.080 --> 14:23.020
because I am not a kettle
that needs descaling.

14:23.020 --> 14:24.080
LAUGHTER

14:24.080 --> 14:27.050
The other thing they all talk about
is something that I like to call

14:27.050 --> 14:28.080
the Cauliflower Conspiracy.

14:28.080 --> 14:30.040
I don't know if
you've heard about this.

14:30.040 --> 14:32.080
This is the idea that if you like to
have anything unhealthy,

14:32.080 --> 14:36.050
you need to replace that
immediately with cauliflower.

14:36.050 --> 14:39.050
The worst offender for this
is cauliflower pizza.

14:39.050 --> 14:41.040
I tell you what this is.
Right, they say,

14:41.040 --> 14:43.090
"Oh, it's like normal pizza
but you take away the dough base

14:43.090 --> 14:46.040
"and you replace it with a disc of
mashed-up cauliflower."

14:46.040 --> 14:48.070
So nothing like normal pizza.

14:48.070 --> 14:50.060
LAUGHTER

14:50.060 --> 14:52.060
I made one. It took me six hours.

14:53.080 --> 14:56.040
The first thing you've got to do
is grate the cauliflower.

14:56.040 --> 14:58.000
Now, I don't know if you've noticed,

14:58.000 --> 15:01.010
the cauliflower is not
a shape for grating.

15:01.010 --> 15:04.020
It's not a shape, is it?
It's just chaos. It's everywhere.

15:04.020 --> 15:06.010
It's so fragile,
when you touch it to metal,

15:06.010 --> 15:07.030
it immediately explodes -

15:07.030 --> 15:09.070
it's like you're in
the middle of Frozen.

15:09.070 --> 15:11.030
LAUGHTER

15:11.030 --> 15:13.020
You end up with this
vegetable dandruff.

15:13.020 --> 15:14.040
You put it in the microwave.

15:14.040 --> 15:16.000
You warm it up,
that makes it really wet,

15:16.000 --> 15:18.010
you have to get the moisture
out of the cauliflower,

15:18.010 --> 15:20.020
then you have to pat it down
into a rough base shape.

15:20.020 --> 15:22.050
Then they say, "Choose the topping.
Whatever you like.

15:22.050 --> 15:24.080
"You can choose whatever
topping you like."

15:24.080 --> 15:27.090
And I think we can agree I had lost
most of my day up until this point.

15:27.090 --> 15:29.090
So, "I thought I'm going
to claw a victory back

15:29.090 --> 15:31.030
"right at the last minute."

15:31.030 --> 15:33.040
So, the topping I chose
was a whole Domino's.

15:33.040 --> 15:35.020
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

15:35.020 --> 15:36.080
Thank you very much.

15:36.080 --> 15:40.010
Well done, both of you, and the
points there go to Larry Dean!

15:40.010 --> 15:41.050
Sit back down.

15:45.040 --> 15:48.010
Our next round is called
Picture of the Week.

15:48.010 --> 15:50.040
I show the panel a topical image and

15:50.040 --> 15:53.070
ask them to tell me what is
happening. So what's going on here?

15:54.090 --> 15:57.040
Is he writing a terrible review
for the Tory Party Conference

15:57.040 --> 15:58.080
on TripAdvisor?

16:00.040 --> 16:03.080
No, he's tweeting Dara to tell him
he is not happy with the

16:03.080 --> 16:05.000
anti-Corbyn bias.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.080
I think it's just nice to see
Jeremy Corbyn looking comfortable on

16:09.080 --> 16:11.010
a front bench.

16:13.060 --> 16:18.010
Is it Britain's loneliest wizard
on his way back to Hogwarts?

16:19.090 --> 16:22.010
This isn't a very interesting photo,
is it? It isn't.

16:22.010 --> 16:24.000
It's like it's
a "Where's Wally?" picture

16:24.000 --> 16:26.040
and even Wally couldn't be arsed
to turn up.

16:28.040 --> 16:29.080
Is he setting an alarm

16:29.080 --> 16:31.050
to water his courgettes?

16:34.010 --> 16:36.080
"Oh, another dick pic from Blair!"

16:38.090 --> 16:41.020
It is...
Shall I tell you what that photo is?

16:41.020 --> 16:43.030
Yeah, go on, tell us,
put us all out of our misery. Yes.

16:43.030 --> 16:44.040
It's Jeremy Corbyn.

16:44.040 --> 16:47.090
It is Jeremy Corbyn!
Thank you very much, Hugh.

16:47.090 --> 16:49.080
APPLAUSE

16:49.080 --> 16:52.050
Yes, it is the Labour Leader,
Jeremy Corbyn.

16:52.050 --> 16:55.040
The annual Labour Party Conference
was held in Liverpool this week,

16:55.040 --> 16:58.020
where the party discussed backing
another referendum on Brexit,

16:58.020 --> 17:01.090
economic reforms and changing
the rules on deselection of MPs.

17:01.090 --> 17:04.060
So what did the party eventually
decide about another referendum?

17:04.060 --> 17:06.050
They're going to need
a bigger table.

17:07.079 --> 17:10.050
Essentially, yes, because it's quite
the buffet of options

17:10.050 --> 17:11.060
for the Labour Party!

17:11.060 --> 17:14.030
Maybe you'd like a little bit of
this with a little bit of cabinet,

17:14.030 --> 17:16.079
and a little bit of Norway maybe?
Num-num-num-num-num!

17:18.050 --> 17:21.000
Yeah, I think they eventually
settled on that they're not...

17:21.000 --> 17:22.089
They're not taking any options off
the table.

17:22.089 --> 17:24.079
That's how much of a fudge this is.

17:24.079 --> 17:27.000
We have decided not to
eliminate anything.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.070
Everything is still on,
whether, you know...

17:29.070 --> 17:32.040
John McDonnell said,
"Definitely not,"

17:32.040 --> 17:34.070
and then Keir Starmer went,
"Shut up!"

17:34.070 --> 17:38.040
Yeah. So that's now on the table.
That's back on the table.

17:38.040 --> 17:40.080
It's not that I'm opposed to
another referendum,

17:40.080 --> 17:43.040
but it's the fact that they
keep calling the People's Vote...

17:43.040 --> 17:45.040
Who did they think
were voting before?

17:45.040 --> 17:50.010
Dogs. Was it our pets,
and now they don't get passports?

17:50.010 --> 17:52.070
What happens is, that's why
they've found so many of those cards

17:52.070 --> 17:54.060
with a little fox shit on them.

17:54.060 --> 17:57.090
But it wasn't really fox,
or was it, Dara?

17:57.090 --> 18:01.010
Ah-ha! I strike again! Mmm...

18:01.010 --> 18:03.070
If it was dogs voting last time,
that explains a lot

18:03.070 --> 18:06.080
cos there's no way a dog is
going to vote to stay.

18:08.060 --> 18:13.020
The whole thing,
it's government by Magic 8-Ball.

18:13.020 --> 18:15.040
Shall we leave the EU?

18:15.040 --> 18:17.000
The future is uncertain.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.020
APPLAUSE Press on with that.

18:23.020 --> 18:24.070
Clearly, it's like one of these...

18:24.070 --> 18:28.040
We can go, you know, why have Labour
stepped out of this debate?

18:28.040 --> 18:31.000
Why have they not been involved in
this debate for two years?

18:31.000 --> 18:33.010
That's all very well
if they were standing back

18:33.010 --> 18:36.030
and just, you know, being
strong and united but they're not.

18:36.030 --> 18:38.040
They're standing back
and they're about as united as

18:38.040 --> 18:41.000
a fucking synchronised swimming...

18:41.000 --> 18:42.030
No, that is united.

18:43.040 --> 18:46.010
They must be very united.

18:46.010 --> 18:48.080
What is Labour's response to Brexit?
Do you know?

18:48.080 --> 18:50.070
No-one knows!

18:50.070 --> 18:53.020
They have proposed a thing.
They have proposed a thing.

18:53.020 --> 18:55.070
They said that it is very important
there should be...

18:55.070 --> 18:58.030
They've got the six-point test.
The six test. Ah!

18:58.030 --> 19:01.030
Our Brexit plan is played by tricks,

19:01.030 --> 19:03.080
come and answer our questions six!

19:05.000 --> 19:09.040
No-one can see it. No.
It's question the second. Yeah.

19:09.040 --> 19:13.020
No, it's Deliverability, Bashful...

19:13.020 --> 19:15.040
LAUGHTER

19:15.040 --> 19:18.060
Why was Corbin criticised after
a recent television interview?

19:18.060 --> 19:21.040
He wouldn't apologise for being...

19:21.040 --> 19:24.000
Well, for allegations
of anti-Semitism.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.020
Are we still talking about this?
Yes.

19:26.020 --> 19:29.000
The only thing that's gone on
longer than anti-Semitism in

19:29.000 --> 19:31.050
the Labour Party is just
anti-Semitism.

19:33.030 --> 19:36.000
What he said was,
"I will die fighting racism."

19:36.000 --> 19:38.040
I thought, "No, probably
a stroke on your allotment."

19:44.080 --> 19:49.000
They have just handled it
so spectacularly badly

19:49.000 --> 19:51.080
that even Gordon Brown
had to step in and go,

19:51.080 --> 19:54.040
"Come on, guys,
you need to sort this out."

19:54.040 --> 19:58.000
When Gordon Brown is trying to
sort out a rift in the Labour Party,

19:58.000 --> 20:00.060
that's like the wino
outside Londis telling you

20:00.060 --> 20:02.050
you need to sort your life out.

20:04.020 --> 20:07.080
That one worked. Yeah. The
synchronised swimming thing... No.

20:07.080 --> 20:10.070
Although, actually, having
a synchronised swimmer outside

20:10.070 --> 20:14.030
Londis telling you to sort your
life out also, I think, would work.

20:14.030 --> 20:17.060
You know you've got to do -
you've got to sort your life out.

20:17.060 --> 20:20.050
LAUGHTER

20:20.050 --> 20:22.090
MUMBLING

20:22.090 --> 20:25.000
Spin round. Yeah, you go round
and round and round,

20:25.000 --> 20:27.070
and you go there with one leg up.

20:27.070 --> 20:30.070
Why are all synchronised swimmers
Cockneys?

20:30.070 --> 20:33.040
They're all Cockney!

20:35.060 --> 20:36.080
And return.

20:38.090 --> 20:43.060
I just find it amazing how, like,
easy it should be for Corbyn to

20:43.060 --> 20:46.080
actually be a viable Prime Minister
but he keeps messing up.

20:46.080 --> 20:51.040
There was a poll recently that
36% of people like Theresa May,

20:51.040 --> 20:53.060
and think she'd be a viable
Prime Minister,

20:53.060 --> 20:58.020
23% think Corbyn would be,
and 39% don't know,

20:58.020 --> 21:01.040
so confusion is in the lead
in the polls.

21:03.040 --> 21:05.060
It's all to play for.

21:05.060 --> 21:08.080
What did party members
make it easier to do?

21:08.080 --> 21:10.090
Deselection. And reselection.

21:10.090 --> 21:13.000
So they would be able to
get rid of sitting MPs.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.020
What they should do is get rid of
the lying ones.

21:16.020 --> 21:18.050
Oh! Oh!

21:18.050 --> 21:21.090
Do you know what? That was the angry
sex equivalent of telling a joke.

21:23.050 --> 21:25.050
Why won't you leave me?!

21:28.080 --> 21:30.090
All I wanted was a cabbage!

21:33.080 --> 21:36.000
Moving on... Erm...

21:36.000 --> 21:38.060
According to scientists,
what takes a third of a second?

21:38.060 --> 21:41.070
To fall in love.
Well, decide you fancy someone.

21:41.070 --> 21:43.010
Decide you fancy someone, yeah.

21:43.010 --> 21:45.010
Following in love was
overstating it slightly.

21:45.010 --> 21:47.020
It doesn't take a third of
a second to fall in love -

21:47.020 --> 21:49.080
it takes a third of a second
to go, "I would."

21:51.000 --> 21:53.040
It is basically...
I can prove it now, Dara.

21:53.040 --> 21:56.040
Look, would, would,
not now I've seen that.

21:57.050 --> 21:59.070
I'm glad you stopped there,
by the way.

21:59.070 --> 22:01.070
LAUGHTER

22:01.070 --> 22:04.050
It leaves the mystique
in our relationship.

22:04.050 --> 22:07.050
Dara, how long did it take you to
fall in love with Brian Cox?

22:08.080 --> 22:11.020
Don't you dare!

22:11.020 --> 22:14.010
You take that back!
You take that back!

22:16.030 --> 22:19.000
He's just a better version of you.

22:21.020 --> 22:25.010
Tell him it's not true!
Tell him it's not true!

22:25.010 --> 22:27.040
No. It's not. It's not.

22:29.010 --> 22:32.040
I'm going to take you to
space and back!

22:34.020 --> 22:35.090
There's Uranus.

22:35.090 --> 22:39.000
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
Come on... Come on!

22:45.030 --> 22:48.080
And all your humour is over there.

22:50.050 --> 22:53.010
I literally only bring a notepad
to make it look like

22:53.010 --> 22:55.050
I've thought of stuff.

22:55.050 --> 22:58.060
IN IRISH ACCENT: Oh, di, do, de, do,
leprechaun.

23:03.030 --> 23:06.090
OK, at the end of that round, the
points go to Angela, Hugh and Larry!

23:11.040 --> 23:13.060
Now we come to
Scenes We'd Like To See,

23:13.060 --> 23:16.030
so if everyone can make their way
over to the performance area,

23:16.030 --> 23:17.070
I will read out this week's topics,

23:17.070 --> 23:20.000
and then we'll see what our
panellists can come up with.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.030
OK, here we go.

23:23.040 --> 23:25.040
The first subject is...

23:29.040 --> 23:31.030
Masel tov!

23:37.000 --> 23:39.050
Why are we having this conference
in Blackpool?

23:39.050 --> 23:41.090
Two words - cheap cocaine.

23:44.040 --> 23:46.000
Jeremy Hunt is
having a heart attack!

23:46.000 --> 23:47.090
Is there a doctor in the house?

23:47.090 --> 23:49.050
Why are you laughing?

23:52.020 --> 23:55.010
So we'll be having one
speech from a Remainer,

23:55.010 --> 23:57.090
a speech from a Brexiteer,
another speech from a Remainer,

23:57.090 --> 23:59.050
another speech from a Brexiteer,

23:59.050 --> 24:01.080
and then Boris Johnson
will drop his trousers.

24:01.080 --> 24:04.090
So that's in, out, in, out,
shake it all about.

24:09.060 --> 24:13.040
What this conference has taught me
is that this party needs more women,

24:13.040 --> 24:16.060
because the hotel bar last night was
an absolute sausage fest.

24:21.000 --> 24:25.030
Welcome, delegates, to this year's
Liberal Democrats Conference.

24:25.030 --> 24:27.030
Conference, Conference,
Conference...

24:33.080 --> 24:38.020
So, to those who say we have
alienated too many groups in

24:38.020 --> 24:41.080
society to get elected,
let me say this -

24:41.080 --> 24:43.010
fuck off.

24:48.040 --> 24:51.090
I know some of you have been
challenging my leadership,

24:51.090 --> 24:53.030
and to you I say,

24:53.030 --> 24:55.080
bring it on, ya bawbags!

25:00.000 --> 25:02.080
Some have said that the Labour Party
has lost contact

25:02.080 --> 25:05.020
with its working-class roots,
but I say to these people

25:05.020 --> 25:07.020
the same thing I said to
my driver this morning,

25:07.020 --> 25:08.080
"Do not address me directly."

25:14.060 --> 25:19.010
So, now we have sorted out Brexit...

25:19.010 --> 25:21.020
LAUGHTER

25:24.050 --> 25:26.040
They told us Brexit was
undeliverable.

25:26.040 --> 25:28.050
They told us Brexit was unworkable.

25:28.050 --> 25:29.090
But where are they now?

25:29.090 --> 25:32.080
They are outside with
banners saying, "I told you so."

25:37.080 --> 25:39.080
Right, it's the
Green Party Conference,

25:39.080 --> 25:41.080
and now it's time to
break for lunch.

25:41.080 --> 25:43.030
Who ordered the veal?

25:46.040 --> 25:49.020
I'm afraid Rees-Mogg can't
be with us today -

25:49.020 --> 25:52.040
someone hung garlic at the threshold
and he can't pass through.

25:52.040 --> 25:55.080
APPLAUSE

25:55.080 --> 26:00.040
So everything is still on the table.

26:00.040 --> 26:04.020
Why has no-one cleared the table?

26:09.040 --> 26:12.070
It's incredible to think that
some people think of us as a cult.

26:12.070 --> 26:14.060
Anyway, could you all just line up

26:14.060 --> 26:17.000
while Jeremy Corbyn
chooses his wives?

26:20.080 --> 26:22.080
Of course the Tories
are like regular people.

26:22.080 --> 26:24.070
You should have seen us in
the bar last night.

26:24.070 --> 26:27.020
Giles' wet nurse downed
a whole bottle of port.

26:32.040 --> 26:36.030
We have had soft Brexit,
we have had hard Brexit,

26:36.030 --> 26:40.070
but now we have a more digestible
alternative -

26:40.070 --> 26:42.040
Ready Brexit.

26:49.090 --> 26:53.010
OK. The next topic is...

26:55.060 --> 26:57.060
Hmm... Interesting.

26:57.060 --> 26:59.000
I think it might be fox.

26:59.000 --> 27:02.040
LAUGHTER AND GROANING

27:03.060 --> 27:06.040
Sierra, Alfa, Disco,
Poker, Nipple...

27:06.040 --> 27:09.000
Actually, I've got no idea
what I'm talking about.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.080
After seven very tedious seasons,

27:13.080 --> 27:16.090
finally things pick up on
CSI: Salisbury.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.030
I want photographs of the body.

27:23.030 --> 27:26.050
I'll take an 8 by 10 canvas,
a key ring and a mousemat.

27:29.090 --> 27:34.040
There are 16 different
semen samples in this bed, Sarge.

27:34.040 --> 27:37.020
I should've read the TripAdvisor
report on this hotel.

27:41.020 --> 27:43.020
And as you can see from
the chalk outline,

27:43.020 --> 27:46.080
the victim had a tiny head
and was sitting on a giant circle.

27:46.080 --> 27:49.010
Sorry, I think that's
a disabled parking space.

27:54.060 --> 27:59.010
So your crime number is
one, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero...

27:59.010 --> 28:01.010
Oh, my God, you're our
millionth customer!

28:01.010 --> 28:03.070
I'm really sorry
what happened to your husband.

28:07.010 --> 28:10.010
Welcome to the new detective show
from the north-east,

28:10.010 --> 28:12.080
CSWHYAYE: Newcastle.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.030
Two inches to the left
and that bullet would have

28:19.030 --> 28:20.080
gone right through your eyeball,

28:20.080 --> 28:23.060
but, as it is, it went through
the other eyeball.

28:29.070 --> 28:32.040
Oh, God, I have to go to the morgue.

28:32.040 --> 28:34.060
He's always eating a sandwich.

28:34.060 --> 28:38.000
We get that you're desensitised,
well done!

28:43.040 --> 28:44.090
Everybody, get down...

28:44.090 --> 28:46.040
..cos this is disco!

28:49.050 --> 28:52.020
Look, I am genuinely sorry that
your father never hugged you,

28:52.020 --> 28:55.080
but when I said,
"It's the police, open up," I...

29:00.060 --> 29:03.060
OK, then, what I suppose we can
deduce is either the victim

29:03.060 --> 29:05.070
was naked and extremely well endowed

29:05.070 --> 29:08.040
or who ever drew this chalk outline
is very immature.

29:12.000 --> 29:16.010
On the doll, please show me where
you were grabbed by the President.

29:21.040 --> 29:23.030
Ms Harris, I'm sorry
to have to do this

29:23.030 --> 29:25.030
but we want you to identify a body.

29:25.030 --> 29:26.060
This body...

29:26.060 --> 29:28.040
# Da da da! #

29:29.080 --> 29:32.050
No, but, seriously, there is a body
and we think it's your fiance.

29:37.060 --> 29:40.040
Huh, 14 bullet wounds to the head -

29:40.040 --> 29:41.090
classic suicide.

29:46.080 --> 29:48.020
Oh, wait!

29:48.020 --> 29:50.060
Maybe it's a man pretending to
shit like a fox.

29:54.030 --> 29:56.010
Welcome to Sun Hill police station.

29:56.010 --> 29:58.060
I'm PC EverybritishactorsfirstTVgig

29:58.060 --> 30:00.090
and this is Sgt ToouglyforHollyoaks.

30:04.060 --> 30:06.040
APPLAUSE

30:06.040 --> 30:09.060
At the end of that round,
the points go to Ed, Kerry and Ed!

30:15.090 --> 30:18.030
That's the end of the show.

30:18.030 --> 30:22.040
This week's winners are Ed Byrne,
Kerry Godliman and Ed Gamble.

30:22.040 --> 30:25.030
CHEERING

30:25.030 --> 30:28.060
Commiserations to Larry Dean,
Hugh Dennis and Angela Barnes.

30:28.060 --> 30:31.000
CHEERING

30:31.000 --> 30:34.030
Thank you for watching.
I'm Dara O Briain. Goodnight.
