<i>(Castle) "As he saw</i>
<i>the dark figure approaching,</i>

00:56.256 --> 00:58.357
<i>"he rose up for a better view,</i>

00:58.391 --> 01:01.660
little knowing he was heading

01:01.694 --> 01:03.328
Ooh.
Wow.

01:03.363 --> 01:05.531
I know, right?
Oh, and listen to this.

01:05.565 --> 01:08.233
"To my mentor, Richard Castle,

01:08.268 --> 01:10.607
"without whose support and guidance

01:10.727 --> 01:13.386
"this book never would
have seen the light of day."

01:13.966 --> 01:16.201
All you did was give Alex Conrad

01:16.235 --> 01:19.671
a few notes on his manuscript
then send it to your publisher.

01:19.705 --> 01:21.964
He was the one
who wrote the book.

01:22.084 --> 01:24.626
Mm. That's your version.
In my version... (Sighs)

01:24.634 --> 01:27.345
I gently fostered
the glowing embers of talent,

01:27.380 --> 01:30.549
fanning them
into a literary wildfire.

01:30.583 --> 01:32.189
He's gonna be in town

01:32.309 --> 01:33.761
and asked
to get together with me.

01:34.089 --> 01:36.306
He wants to learn more
about my writing process.

01:36.426 --> 01:39.528
And by "process," you mean
your procrastination

01:39.648 --> 01:43.228
until the very last second...
And then writing out of a desperate panic

01:43.262 --> 01:45.647
in a caffeine-induced haze?
That one?

01:45.767 --> 01:47.378
No, not that one.
(Laughs)

01:47.652 --> 01:50.335
The one where I find authenticity

01:50.369 --> 01:53.738
by doing hands-on research
with the NYPD.

01:53.773 --> 01:56.802
Ah. So I'm having Alex meet me
at the precinct later on today.

01:56.922 --> 02:00.579
Beckett will be thrilled with that.
Beckett? I'm sure she won't mind.

02:00.613 --> 02:01.850
You haven't told her yet?

02:01.970 --> 02:04.365
I am <i>sure</i> she will be fine
with it.

02:04.485 --> 02:07.352
Fine with it? Why would I
be fine with it?

02:07.386 --> 02:08.820
Okay. I'm sorry.

02:08.854 --> 02:11.389
Come on. He's a writer.

02:11.424 --> 02:14.726
How much trouble
could he possibly be?

02:14.760 --> 02:17.262
So is that a yes?

02:17.296 --> 02:19.864
Is... is that a no?

02:19.899 --> 02:21.566
(Beckett) Hey, Lanie.
Hey.

02:21.601 --> 02:23.435
Who's this?
Zack Lindsey,

02:23.469 --> 02:25.870
a stand-out on the U.N.Y. swim team.

02:25.905 --> 02:28.897
Or he was before he drowned.
How does a champion swimmer drown?

02:29.017 --> 02:30.947
He had help.
Burns?

02:31.067 --> 02:32.253
From a caustic substance.

02:32.373 --> 02:34.768
Someone put a rag to his face
soaked in the stuff.

02:34.888 --> 02:36.004
He passed out from the fumes,

02:36.124 --> 02:38.245
then was dumped in the pool
to drown.

02:38.365 --> 02:42.621
Based on water and body temp,
I'd say between 1:00 and 5:00 this morning.

02:42.655 --> 02:45.246
And what was the substance?
I won't know till I get him back to the shop.

02:45.366 --> 02:48.082
Who found him?
Zack's teammates when they showed up

02:48.202 --> 02:50.720
for 6:00 A.M. swim practice.
All right. Let's talk to his teammates.

02:50.840 --> 02:53.165
Find out if anyone had it in
for Zack, and let's figure out

02:53.285 --> 02:54.515
where they were
between 1:00 and 5:00 A.M.

02:54.635 --> 02:56.468
I'll go talk to Zack's coach.

02:56.502 --> 02:58.603
(Man)
It just doesn't seem real,

02:58.638 --> 03:01.692
seeing him lying there like that.
What was he doing here so late?

03:01.812 --> 03:03.375
Training.

03:03.409 --> 03:05.377
Couldn't keep that kid
outta the pool.

03:05.411 --> 03:06.878
Mm.
Two weeks ago,

03:06.912 --> 03:08.913
he got food poisoning
right before a meet.

03:08.948 --> 03:11.249
Sick as a dog,
just puking his guts out.

03:11.283 --> 03:14.052
I told him to withdraw,
but he toughed it out.

03:14.086 --> 03:15.587
Won all his events.

03:15.621 --> 03:17.155
But that was Zack.

03:17.189 --> 03:19.724
He was gonna be
the next Rob Tredwyck

03:19.759 --> 03:21.660
or Michael Phelps.

03:21.694 --> 03:23.595
Did he have
any personal problems?

03:23.629 --> 03:25.597
He was a kid from Bensonhurst,
you know?

03:25.631 --> 03:28.099
I got him a partial scholarship,
but he lived on his own

03:28.134 --> 03:29.457
all the way out there because it's all
he could afford.

03:29.577 --> 03:30.618
What about his parents?

03:30.870 --> 03:32.504
Uh, his dad's gone.

03:32.538 --> 03:35.507
His, uh, mom had to move
to Atlantic City for work.

03:35.541 --> 03:37.308
I...

03:37.343 --> 03:38.643
(Police radio chatter)

03:38.678 --> 03:40.779
Promised I was gonna
look out for him.

03:40.813 --> 03:42.113
(Radio chatter continues)

03:42.148 --> 03:43.615
What about the swim team?

03:43.649 --> 03:46.084
There must have been
some rivalries there.

03:46.118 --> 03:48.086
He and Brian Morris were
our two best chances

03:48.120 --> 03:51.089
to win the tournament this week,
but there was no bad blood,

03:51.123 --> 03:54.092
not with Brian or anyone else on the team.
Okay I'm still gonna need a team roster

03:54.126 --> 03:58.329
and a list of all the people
who had access to this pool.

04:00.700 --> 04:02.634
Uh... excuse me.

04:02.668 --> 04:04.936
Mm-hmm.

04:04.970 --> 04:08.273
This is why Alexis
is never going to college.

04:08.307 --> 04:09.708
(Esposito) Hey.

04:09.742 --> 04:12.510
You want to hear something crazy?
Yeah.

04:12.545 --> 04:14.512
I was talking
to the night janitor.

04:14.547 --> 04:16.514
He was here
till 1:30 last night,

04:16.548 --> 04:19.884
but he saw Zack with another guy.
Do we have a name?

04:19.918 --> 04:22.887
We have a picture, too.
"Rocket" Rob Tredwyck.

04:22.922 --> 04:25.690
(Man with Australian accent)
Give us a big smile, mate.

04:25.725 --> 04:27.492
(Camera shutter clicking)

04:27.526 --> 04:30.562
<i>♪</i>

04:30.596 --> 04:32.530
Yes, like that.

04:32.565 --> 04:34.532
You love this man.
You want him.

04:34.567 --> 04:38.036
That's funny.
I want him, too.

04:38.070 --> 04:40.371
The guy was invincible in water.

04:40.406 --> 04:42.373
I can't believe he'd drown.

04:42.408 --> 04:45.176
How did you know him?
From a tournament, three years ago.

04:45.211 --> 04:47.679
Zack was a freshman
while I was headed to Beijing.

04:47.713 --> 04:49.914
(Chuckles)
I could tell he was special.

04:49.949 --> 04:52.417
It was like looking
at a younger version of me.

04:52.451 --> 04:56.054
He was really that good?
Yeah, but, uh, that's not what I meant.

04:56.088 --> 04:58.223
Most kids in this sport,
they come from money.

04:58.257 --> 05:00.592
Zack and me,
we both grew up hard.

05:00.626 --> 05:01.958
So I took him under my wing.

05:02.078 --> 05:03.643
Sounds like you were kind
of a mentor to him.

05:03.763 --> 05:05.045
I was just looking out for my own.

05:05.165 --> 05:06.985
So what were you doing
at the pool last night?

05:07.105 --> 05:09.868
Zack said he wanted
to run drills, and I figured,

05:09.902 --> 05:11.536
what the hell?

05:11.570 --> 05:14.272
Now that I'm retired, I don't
do enough time in the water.

05:14.306 --> 05:16.441
But I think he really just needed a friend.
Why is that?

05:16.475 --> 05:19.711
He just had the talk with his girl.
Where do babies come from?

05:19.745 --> 05:21.379
(Chuckles)
No, not that talk.

05:21.413 --> 05:23.715
The one I had with
my high school girlfriend

05:23.749 --> 05:26.251
back in Wilmington.
(Camera shutter clicking)

05:26.285 --> 05:28.586
If you want to get to the top,

05:28.621 --> 05:30.522
you can't take everyone with you.

05:30.556 --> 05:32.891
So some people,
you have to leave behind

05:32.925 --> 05:35.393
so you have the talk.
And how did she handle that?

05:35.427 --> 05:39.197
She took it hard.
So did Zack.

05:39.231 --> 05:41.733
But he was worried about her,

05:41.767 --> 05:44.302
worried that she might
do something stupid.

05:44.336 --> 05:46.069
Do you remember her name?

05:46.189 --> 05:48.447
Bridget.
Bridget McManus.

05:48.567 --> 05:50.374
And what time did you
leave the pool last night?

05:50.494 --> 05:51.563
A little after midnight.

05:51.844 --> 05:53.745
Where were you
between 1:00 and 5:00 A.M.?

05:53.779 --> 05:55.747
At Buddha Bar
with half the ad agency.

05:55.781 --> 05:57.982
We partied till dawn.
Mm-hmm.

05:58.017 --> 06:00.485
(Man) We're ready for you, Rocket.
Man... (Sighs)

06:00.519 --> 06:03.521
Hell of a day to sell cologne.

06:05.357 --> 06:06.991
What were you looking at?

06:07.026 --> 06:09.627
(Camera shutter clicks)
Nothing.

06:32.852 --> 06:37.121
first day I put him in the pool,
he was 2 years old.

06:37.156 --> 06:40.124
Took to it like a fish.

06:40.159 --> 06:41.960
You have kids?

06:41.994 --> 06:43.795
Two daughters and a son.

06:43.829 --> 06:47.098
It's what we do for them, right?

06:47.132 --> 06:49.300
When his dad left

06:49.335 --> 06:51.336
and I was feeling lower
than dirt,

06:51.370 --> 06:53.371
you know what he told me?

06:53.405 --> 06:56.374
He said, "I'm gonna be someone
one day for you, ma,

06:56.408 --> 07:00.345
so you can walk
down the street and be proud."

07:02.181 --> 07:05.350
(Crying)
Who did this?

07:05.384 --> 07:06.951
Who killed my son?

07:06.986 --> 07:10.088
We're doing everything we can
to find out.

07:11.690 --> 07:14.359
Ms. Dinovi, what can you
tell me about Bridget McManus?

07:14.393 --> 07:17.161
Her and Zack have been
an item since high school.

07:17.196 --> 07:19.163
What's this got to do
with Bridget?

07:19.198 --> 07:21.165
Maybe nothing, we're just
checking everywhere.

07:21.200 --> 07:24.569
Did he mention anything else,
any trouble he might be in?

07:24.603 --> 07:27.739
Zack knew what trouble was.
He wanted no part of it.

07:27.773 --> 07:30.141
People don't get out
of our neighborhood.

07:32.711 --> 07:35.546
Zack was gonna make it.

07:35.581 --> 07:39.884
My baby, he was going to make it.

07:39.952 --> 07:43.054
(Indistinct conversations)

07:43.088 --> 07:45.023
(Beckett) Captain.

07:45.057 --> 07:46.524
Zack's mom.

07:46.558 --> 07:49.160
Anything about the girlfriend?
Not that she knows of.

07:49.194 --> 07:51.162
She seemed to think
everything was okay.

07:51.196 --> 07:53.231
Ah, then there was a lot
he wasn't sharing.

07:53.265 --> 07:56.167
Check out the text messages
that Bridget fired off to Zack

07:56.201 --> 07:58.169
on the night he was killed.

07:58.203 --> 08:00.204
Ooh. Not a lot of "lols"
in there.

08:00.239 --> 08:03.041
"Zack, if you leave me, I swear
to God, I'll kill you."

08:03.075 --> 08:05.743
She has a way with words.
And a record to go with it.

08:05.778 --> 08:07.245
Disorderly conduct.
Mostly minor stuff.

08:07.279 --> 08:09.547
Uniforms are bringing her in now.
It says here she's 5'2".

08:09.581 --> 08:13.051
You really think she could overpower Zack?
Uh, no, but her brothers could.

08:13.085 --> 08:15.353
In grand Irish tradition,
she has four of them,

08:15.387 --> 08:17.889
each over 6 foot, each with
his own claim to fame...

08:17.923 --> 08:19.624
Assaults...
Oh.

08:19.658 --> 08:21.292
Ag. Assault...
Bad.

08:21.327 --> 08:23.294
A.D.W., battery...
Ee. Mm.

08:23.329 --> 08:25.630
Assault on city employee, parking enforcement.
Doesn't count.

08:25.664 --> 08:27.532
Easy.
Dude.

08:27.566 --> 08:29.901
I... just jokes. All right, find
out where her brothers were

08:29.935 --> 08:31.636
between 1:00 and 5:00 A.M.

08:31.670 --> 08:34.105
Castle and I will talk to Bridget.
Thank you, sir.

08:34.139 --> 08:35.606
Kill him?

08:35.640 --> 08:38.308
I've loved Zack Lindsey
since the ninth grade.

08:38.344 --> 08:40.745
You have a funny way
of showing it.

08:40.779 --> 08:42.813
I was pissed.

08:42.847 --> 08:45.316
For five years, I cooked
his steamed chicken breast,

08:45.351 --> 08:47.585
I put his pasta in the tupperware

08:47.619 --> 08:50.588
at 4:00 in the morning,
I kept him company at the gym.

08:50.622 --> 08:52.957
And then he tells me,
"Sorry, Bridge.

08:52.992 --> 08:55.426
I can't have any other voices
in my head."

08:55.461 --> 08:57.462
Like suddenly, I'm a distraction.

08:57.496 --> 09:01.132
Like suddenly, I'm not good
enough for Colorado Springs?

09:01.166 --> 09:03.167
So you threatened to kill him
unless he took you back?

09:03.202 --> 09:06.070
No, that's how I talk, okay?

09:06.105 --> 09:08.973
But there was something going on.

09:09.008 --> 09:11.809
And it had nothing to do
with swimming.

09:11.844 --> 09:13.811
What do you mean?

09:13.846 --> 09:16.681
Lately, he had been stressed,
secretive.

09:16.715 --> 09:19.684
Add that to him saying,
"This is my time,"

09:19.718 --> 09:22.186
and the way those rich
college girls looked at him.

09:22.221 --> 09:25.123
I wasn't born yesterday.
I can do the math.

09:25.157 --> 09:27.425
You thought there was someone else.
Oh, yeah.

09:27.459 --> 09:29.827
So I followed him out of
his apartment the other night,

09:29.862 --> 09:32.296
ready to fight some queen bitch
from Connecticut

09:32.331 --> 09:35.666
for what's mine, only it wasn't another girl.
Well, who was it?

09:35.701 --> 09:37.869
I don't know.
Some scary looking guy.

09:37.903 --> 09:39.337
They met under the el,

09:39.371 --> 09:42.340
and they went at it,
yelling and screaming.

09:42.374 --> 09:43.654
I couldn't tell about what,
though,

09:43.774 --> 09:44.994
'cause the guy had, like, an accent.

09:45.114 --> 09:47.973
What kind of accent...
Spanish, Asian, Russian?

09:48.093 --> 09:49.558
Do I look like I work
at the U.N.?

09:50.516 --> 09:52.784
Not Brooklyn, okay?

09:52.818 --> 09:55.019
Okay. No...

09:55.054 --> 09:57.155
Anyways, I asked Zack
about it afterwards,

09:57.189 --> 09:59.457
and he said it was nothing,
but it wasn't.

09:59.491 --> 10:03.828
Do you think you could describe
this guy to our sketch artist?

10:03.862 --> 10:06.230
(Telephone receiver clatters)

10:06.265 --> 10:08.399
So Lanie confirms
no drug in his system,

10:08.434 --> 10:10.435
performance-enhancing
or otherwise.

10:10.469 --> 10:13.037
And from the high levels
of chloride ion in his blood,

10:13.072 --> 10:15.339
she is sure that the burns
came from chlorine.

10:15.374 --> 10:18.242
Hmm. So our
heavily accented killer

10:18.277 --> 10:20.845
rendered Zack unconscious
with a chlorine-soaked rag.

10:20.879 --> 10:23.981
We don't know that he's a killer.
Is this the face of an innocent man?

10:24.016 --> 10:25.983
He had a heated argument
with our victim

10:26.018 --> 10:29.153
the night before he was killed.
And what would his motive be exactly?

10:29.188 --> 10:31.089
He... if...

10:31.123 --> 10:33.391
<i>I...</i> may have a line
on that.

10:33.425 --> 10:35.608
I'm looking at Zack's financials.

10:35.728 --> 10:39.019
The guy only had a partial
scholarship. He still paid

10:39.139 --> 10:41.267
for most of his tuition,
books, and living expenses,

10:41.387 --> 10:43.067
all without taking student loans.

10:43.102 --> 10:46.124
He didn't have a job, and his
mom was just squeaking by.

10:46.244 --> 10:48.534
<i>And</i> NCAA rules

10:48.654 --> 10:50.950
preclude him from receiving
any financial assistance

10:51.070 --> 10:52.310
from outside his family.

10:52.344 --> 10:54.212
So where did he get that money?

10:55.305 --> 10:57.229
You think maybe he borrowed
money from the wrong guys

10:57.349 --> 10:59.884
to finance his dream?
And when he couldn't make the payments,

10:59.919 --> 11:02.220
they came after him.
That would explain the argument.

11:02.254 --> 11:04.255
(Cell phone rings) Esposito.

11:04.290 --> 11:05.892
We don't even know
that there was an argument,

11:06.012 --> 11:08.424
and the only evidence we have
is a sketch of a man

11:08.544 --> 11:10.995
that Bridget claims she saw.
(Esposito) Start processing it.

11:11.030 --> 11:12.564
All right, thanks.

11:13.263 --> 11:15.733
(Beep) Uniforms just
got to Zack's place.

11:15.768 --> 11:17.836
Looks like it's been tossed.

11:17.870 --> 11:20.438
This place looks like
my first apartment.

11:20.472 --> 11:22.440
We used to have cockroach races.

11:22.474 --> 11:25.844
Wonder if that's how Kafka
got the idea.

11:25.878 --> 11:28.379
(Police radio chatter)

11:28.414 --> 11:31.015
Looks like Zack
didn't do his chores.

11:31.050 --> 11:32.550
(Camera shutter clicks)

11:32.670 --> 11:35.816
Zack was killed and then
his place gets trashed?

11:35.936 --> 11:38.289
Not a coincidence.
(Camera shutter clicking)

11:38.324 --> 11:41.960
You think maybe this was part
of a debt collection effort?

11:41.994 --> 11:44.629
Well, then why'd they leave
the TV and the laptop?

11:44.663 --> 11:47.131
Or the medical supplies.

11:47.166 --> 11:48.967
Dental pick.

11:49.001 --> 11:51.336
You think plaque
slows you down in the water?

11:51.370 --> 11:53.705
They were looking
for something specific.

11:53.739 --> 11:55.090
You don't rip through a mattress

11:55.622 --> 11:57.103
unless you've run out
of places to look.

11:57.223 --> 12:00.001
Maybe they didn't find
what they were looking for.

12:00.121 --> 12:04.081
Maybe it's still here, but it's just
too well hidden. (Air whooshes)

12:04.116 --> 12:06.284
What?

12:09.188 --> 12:12.156
(Paper rustles)

12:12.191 --> 12:14.692
(Camera shutter clicks)

12:14.726 --> 12:18.396
(Glass clattering)

12:20.065 --> 12:21.332
Medication?

12:21.366 --> 12:23.134
Only one thing I know of

12:23.168 --> 12:24.357
comes in little vials like that.

12:24.804 --> 12:29.140
Anabolic steroids.
Zack's clean. Why would he have steroids?

12:29.174 --> 12:31.976
Maybe he's not as clean
as we thought.

12:32.010 --> 12:38.649
Sync & corrections by honeybunny
www.addic7ed.com

12:45.608 --> 12:47.689
Yep, it's steroids all right.

12:47.809 --> 12:49.848
I thought you said Zack
wasn't using steroids.

12:49.968 --> 12:52.917
The test wouldn't pick up stuff like this.
Why not?

12:53.037 --> 12:56.385
It's loaded with masking agents
and designed to beat the test...

12:56.419 --> 12:59.661
Virtually untraceable unless
you look for it specifically.

12:59.781 --> 13:01.690
- So he was using.
- Nope.

13:02.421 --> 13:04.519
I went back and tested
for this, too.

13:04.639 --> 13:06.069
Your boy is steroid-free.

13:06.189 --> 13:07.637
Well, if he wasn't
using steroids,

13:07.757 --> 13:10.644
then what was he doing with them?
Virtually undetectable?

13:10.764 --> 13:13.411
Where does a drug like that come from?
There's been some talk about

13:13.531 --> 13:15.941
a new beat-the-test
performance-enhancing drug

13:16.061 --> 13:18.017
being developed
somewhere in Eastern Europe.

13:18.137 --> 13:20.075
Eastern Europe...

13:20.952 --> 13:23.845
Home of
the hard-to-identify accent.

13:23.880 --> 13:26.686
Given how great
everyone says Zack was,

13:26.806 --> 13:29.088
this whole steroids thing
just doesn't make sense.

13:29.208 --> 13:30.621
Well, we know
he needed the money.

13:30.741 --> 13:32.568
If he wasn't using, maybe he was dealing.

13:32.688 --> 13:35.138
Well, that definitely would've given him
the cash needed to make ends meet.

13:35.258 --> 13:37.024
Yeah, but he only had a couple of vials.

13:37.144 --> 13:38.493
Maybe he was low on inventory,

13:38.528 --> 13:41.520
<i>and</i> the man
Zack was arguing with,

13:41.640 --> 13:44.693
our secretive Slav,
he was the distributor.

13:44.994 --> 13:46.168
If there even was a man.

13:46.202 --> 13:48.208
For all we know,
Bridget was lying.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.937
Well, she wasn't lying
about her brothers.

13:51.197 --> 13:53.012
I talked to all four of them,

13:53.132 --> 13:56.191
one Irishman to another
and another.

13:56.311 --> 13:57.940
Anyway, they alibied out.

13:58.060 --> 13:59.785
They were in New Paltz
when Zack was killed.

14:00.039 --> 14:01.405
All of them?
Mm-hmm.

14:01.525 --> 14:02.772
For what?

14:03.182 --> 14:06.404
They were at a sporting event
of a... sorts.

14:06.438 --> 14:09.273
Which was?

14:09.308 --> 14:12.443
Leprechaun toss.
Don't ask.

14:12.477 --> 14:15.415
Anyway, the, uh, older brother,
he got first place.

14:15.535 --> 14:16.328
Oh, man.

14:16.448 --> 14:18.528
Well, the merits
of Irish culture aside...

14:18.648 --> 14:19.662
Hey.
Sorry.

14:19.782 --> 14:22.469
Perhaps this suggests that
Bridget was telling the truth

14:22.589 --> 14:27.136
about our elusive Estonian.
I'll run the sketch past Narco and Vice,

14:27.256 --> 14:30.079
see if they recognize him.
Okay, and check if Zack was on their radar.

14:32.035 --> 14:34.185
And, Esposito, can you
talk to Zack's teammates

14:34.305 --> 14:35.966
about the steroids,
find out what they knew?

14:36.001 --> 14:37.968
Zack would never touch steroids.

14:38.003 --> 14:39.140
None of us would.

14:39.260 --> 14:42.440
Mm-hmm.
Look, the fact of the matter is,

14:42.474 --> 14:45.937
Zack was clean, but we found
steroids at his place.

14:46.429 --> 14:47.712
We're just trying
to figure out why.

14:47.746 --> 14:51.082
Are you saying you think Zack was a dealer?
Look, it's not enough that he's dead.

14:51.116 --> 14:52.581
Now you gotta drag him
through the mud?

14:52.701 --> 14:54.221
Let me tell you something
about Zack Lindsey...

14:54.341 --> 14:56.091
He was the heart and soul
of this team.

14:56.211 --> 14:57.663
He was the person
we wanted to be.

14:57.936 --> 15:00.765
So if you found drugs, they were
there for another reason.

15:01.121 --> 15:04.305
Whatever the reason,
he was up to something.

15:04.425 --> 15:06.436
Statements from three
of his neighbors say that

15:06.556 --> 15:08.395
he was going out
and staying out all night.

15:08.515 --> 15:10.935
Yes, to the pool to train.
We already know that.

15:10.969 --> 15:13.132
Except half the time, he was
leaving without his gym bag,

15:13.252 --> 15:14.939
so where was he going?

15:14.973 --> 15:17.251
I'm hoping that you're
asking that just for effect

15:17.371 --> 15:18.943
because you already have
an answer.

15:18.977 --> 15:20.544
I-I got nothing.

15:20.612 --> 15:22.473
(Man) Maybe you're
looking at it wrong.

15:22.951 --> 15:24.851
Maybe the steroids have nothing
to do with his murder.

15:24.971 --> 15:26.368
Maybe they're your red herring.

15:26.488 --> 15:28.954
(Castle) Alex, so glad you made it.
(Hands slap together)

15:29.074 --> 15:31.141
Alex Conrad, please meet
detective Beckett.

15:31.261 --> 15:33.693
Detective Beckett,
Alex Conrad, my protégé.

15:33.813 --> 15:36.193
Nice to meet you.
It's a real pleasure, detective.

15:36.228 --> 15:38.996
I have read "Heat Wave"
and "Naked Heat" so many times,

15:39.030 --> 15:40.336
I feel like I know you...

15:40.456 --> 15:44.001
The piercing intelligence,
the self-assured beauty.

15:44.450 --> 15:46.353
Oh, um, thank you.

15:46.473 --> 15:48.756
Uh, so what were you saying
about the steroids?

15:49.289 --> 15:50.174
Well, nothing really.

15:50.208 --> 15:52.810
I was just looking at the board,
and I noticed that this swimmer kid,

15:52.844 --> 15:54.344
he's caught between two worlds.

15:54.464 --> 15:56.221
Now if were writing the story,

15:56.341 --> 15:58.189
the steroids would just be
a red herring,

15:58.489 --> 15:59.411
and the real killer

15:59.531 --> 16:00.819
would be someone
from the old neighborhood.

16:03.344 --> 16:05.069
Uh, yeah. But, hey,
that's just me.

16:05.189 --> 16:06.504
Clearly I'm new at this.

16:06.624 --> 16:08.527
Alex, don't worry.
It takes years of experience...

16:08.647 --> 16:11.463
No. No, you're right.
We don't have any proof

16:11.583 --> 16:13.615
that his has anything to do
with the steroids.

16:13.735 --> 16:15.446
We've just been assuming.
We do need to look

16:15.566 --> 16:18.165
into Zack's old neighborhood as well.
Seriously? I was helpful?

16:18.285 --> 16:21.523
Yes. Yes, you were.
Yes, but you probably have lots of questions,

16:21.643 --> 16:23.181
so we should get going.

16:23.301 --> 16:25.231
Hey, uh,
if it's not overstepping,

16:25.351 --> 16:27.160
uh, just in the interest of
keeping it real, I was wondering

16:27.280 --> 16:28.660
if I could ask you a few questions

16:28.780 --> 16:30.984
for the case I'm coming up with for
"Seriously Dead."

16:32.458 --> 16:34.877
Why don't you just give me a buzz
when the two of you are done?

16:37.711 --> 16:40.366
I mean, if it's okay with you.
Why wouldn't it be okay?

16:40.486 --> 16:42.063
Okay.
Okay.

16:42.183 --> 16:45.362
It's so not okay. After
everything I've done for him,

16:45.397 --> 16:47.732
he goes and tries to steal
my muse.

16:47.852 --> 16:50.701
Muse thievery.
What's the punishment for that,

16:50.821 --> 16:52.612
five to ten in mythology jail?

16:52.732 --> 16:54.772
(Laughing)
Yes, you laugh.

16:54.806 --> 16:56.681
(Laughs) Go ahead.
Laugh all you want.

16:56.801 --> 16:59.146
But now I finally know
what Obi-Wan Kenobi felt like

16:59.266 --> 17:01.568
when Darth Vader turned on him.
Oh.

17:01.688 --> 17:04.147
I shoulda seen this coming.
You know what they're calling him

17:04.182 --> 17:06.454
down at Black Pawn Publishing?
No.

17:06.575 --> 17:10.087
Alex Conrad?
"The next Richard Castle."

17:10.121 --> 17:10.974
Oh.
Yes.

17:11.095 --> 17:13.090
I thought it was a compliment,
but, no.

17:13.211 --> 17:16.248
He's trying to replace me.
What are you gonna do?

17:16.367 --> 17:20.931
I am going
on to richardcastle.net,

17:20.965 --> 17:26.604
I am going to remove my glowing
review of "Dead Serious,"

17:26.637 --> 17:30.975
and replace it with cover art
for "Heat Rises."

17:31.009 --> 17:33.369
That ungrateful little weasel...
Dad, you ever think

17:33.489 --> 17:35.683
that maybe you're overreacting
a teensy bit?

17:35.803 --> 17:38.460
You ever think that maybe
he admires you so much

17:38.580 --> 17:41.166
that spending time with Beckett
is to understand you better?

17:43.088 --> 17:45.556
Don't confuse me
with your reasonableness.

17:45.590 --> 17:46.853
I'm just saying...

17:46.973 --> 17:50.494
Maybe he's not the nefarious
muse-snatcher you think he is.

17:50.529 --> 17:52.997
Maybe you should
give him a chance.

17:56.167 --> 17:57.801
Maybe...

17:57.836 --> 18:00.704
You're right.

18:00.739 --> 18:03.374
Okay, great. Thank you
for your cooperation.

18:03.408 --> 18:05.209
(Receiver clatters)

18:05.243 --> 18:06.977
Thank you.

18:07.012 --> 18:08.238
So Bridget McManus says that

18:08.358 --> 18:11.382
Zack didn't really run with
the Bensonhurst crowd anymore,

18:11.416 --> 18:13.318
but she did give me a list

18:13.438 --> 18:15.960
of all of his
old neighborhood buddies.

18:16.080 --> 18:18.802
Oh, how about I run it down?
Yeah, great.

18:18.922 --> 18:20.991
Yeah.

18:26.064 --> 18:27.398
Muffins.

18:27.432 --> 18:29.867
Mm-hmm. Alex Conrad
sent them to me.

18:29.901 --> 18:32.169
(Muffin thuds)
Alex.

18:34.105 --> 18:37.172
"Thanks for last night." Guess
you two got together last night.

18:37.292 --> 18:39.277
Yeah, we talked about procedure.

18:39.687 --> 18:42.997
Oh, so... nothing special.

18:43.117 --> 18:44.150
I don't know.

18:44.270 --> 18:46.258
He said he was gonna use it all
for his next book,

18:46.378 --> 18:49.285
said next time he wants to talk about cases.
Next time?

18:49.544 --> 18:51.889
So something came up
on our victim.

18:51.923 --> 18:53.783
Not sure what to make of it.
About steroids?

18:53.903 --> 18:55.935
No.
About our mysterious Moldavian?

18:56.055 --> 18:57.192
No, not that either.

18:57.312 --> 18:59.860
Vice and Narcotics struck out
on Zack and the sketch.

18:59.980 --> 19:01.363
But I ran Zack's fingerprints

19:01.483 --> 19:03.233
through the unsolved
latent database.

19:03.268 --> 19:04.486
His prints match a set

19:04.606 --> 19:07.071
found on a car stolen in Queens
two weeks ago.

19:07.105 --> 19:08.721
Who's the owner?

19:08.841 --> 19:10.490
A Patricia Farrell.

19:10.610 --> 19:13.577
Name doesn't ring a bell.

19:13.612 --> 19:16.580
I think I know...
What these are about.

19:16.615 --> 19:20.184
It's, um, a video I saw

19:20.218 --> 19:22.525
on an underground web site
a while ago.

19:22.645 --> 19:23.465
Not surprising.
(Clicking keyboard keys)

19:23.585 --> 19:27.358
Just watch.
Hmm.

19:27.392 --> 19:28.768
(Beep)
Here.

19:30.261 --> 19:33.564
(Air hissing)

19:37.636 --> 19:40.001
So that's how Zack made
tuition and rent

19:40.121 --> 19:43.221
all without a job.
Oh, Zack had a job all right.

19:43.341 --> 19:45.943
He was a car thief.
(Air hisses)

19:52.174 --> 19:54.045
Now we know how Zack
made his money,

19:54.046 --> 19:56.561
why he was out all night...
He was playing Grand Theft Auto.

19:56.681 --> 19:58.146
Yeah, the live-action version.

19:58.266 --> 20:00.415
Maybe he boosted the wrong car
and got in trouble

20:00.535 --> 20:03.413
with the people he was working with.
Our lethal Lithuanian, perhaps?

20:03.533 --> 20:04.534
Guess again, bro.

20:04.654 --> 20:06.693
I ran the names of Zack's pals
from Bensonhurst.

20:06.813 --> 20:09.829
One of them has a prior for auto theft...
a Thomas Marcone.

20:09.949 --> 20:11.838
Tommy Marcone?
Bridget said that

20:11.958 --> 20:15.682
that was Zack's best friend in high school.
Lots of car thieves run in pairs.

20:15.802 --> 20:18.142
Let's go to Bensonhurst.

20:18.939 --> 20:20.511
That's it. Scanlon's bar...

20:20.631 --> 20:22.813
Tommy Marcone's
unofficial hangout.

20:22.847 --> 20:25.749
Looks like the neighborhood
is mourning their local hero.

20:25.784 --> 20:29.153
Yeah, well, at this point,
I'm not sure that's what he was.

20:29.187 --> 20:30.654
Man born into hardship

20:30.689 --> 20:32.656
struggles to reach
for something greater,

20:32.691 --> 20:34.658
only he can't escape
the demons of his past.

20:34.693 --> 20:36.527
It's "Oedipus,"
it's "The Godfather,"

20:36.561 --> 20:38.162
"The Beverly Hillbillies."

20:38.196 --> 20:39.963
(Laughs)
It wasn't that funny.

20:39.998 --> 20:42.366
No, I'm sorry.
I just got a message.

20:42.400 --> 20:45.102
From who? Conrad? It is,
isn't it? What did he say?

20:45.136 --> 20:47.235
Nothing. He just wants to know
what time I can meet up tonight.

20:47.355 --> 20:48.620
And that made you laugh?

20:48.740 --> 20:50.207
Yeah.

20:50.241 --> 20:51.653
He's funny.

20:54.479 --> 20:58.048
<i>(Uncle Lucius) ♪ Take me down</i>
<i>to the liquor store ♪</i>

20:58.083 --> 21:00.317
<i>♪ yeah, I need my poison</i>
<i>close at hand ♪</i>

21:00.351 --> 21:02.669
<i>♪ take me down ♪</i>

21:02.789 --> 21:04.705
Tommy Marcone.

21:04.825 --> 21:06.557
NYPD.

21:06.591 --> 21:08.425
You got the wrong guy.

21:08.460 --> 21:10.764
Remember when?

21:10.884 --> 21:13.319
You're still on probation, aren't you?
(Sighs)

21:13.439 --> 21:16.080
Got a couple of questions
about Zack Lindsey's murder.

21:16.326 --> 21:18.102
Why you gotta sweat me
in front of the whole bar?

21:18.222 --> 21:19.688
What do you want me to do,
take you downtown?

21:20.084 --> 21:22.326
I know that the two of you were stealing
cars together.

21:22.446 --> 21:23.281
You can't prove that.

21:23.320 --> 21:24.776
I know that the two of you
were friends,

21:24.896 --> 21:27.154
I know that I've got
Zack's prints on a stolen car,

21:27.274 --> 21:29.163
and I also know
that you have priors.

21:29.573 --> 21:31.781
And since you two
are friends, we thought

21:31.901 --> 21:33.653
maybe you'd care that Zack's
laying on a slab

21:33.773 --> 21:34.952
and thought
you might want to help him.

21:35.072 --> 21:38.526
He's dead. Ain't nothing I can do now.

21:38.646 --> 21:40.015
Why don't you tell me where you were

21:40.135 --> 21:41.888
between 1:00 and 5:00 A.M.
the night of the murder?

21:42.008 --> 21:44.595
You're wasting your time.

21:44.629 --> 21:46.718
You ever see this man?

21:46.838 --> 21:48.946
No, and your watch is
too expensive for a cop's.

21:49.066 --> 21:51.568
So, detective, who's this guy?

21:51.603 --> 21:54.371
<i>♪ Idle hands ♪</i>

21:54.405 --> 21:56.655
He's the guy buying a round
for the house.

21:58.664 --> 22:00.687
Tommy, if you know something,
you should talk.

22:00.807 --> 22:02.305
(Castle) Hey, everybody,
a round for the house

22:02.425 --> 22:03.672
in memory of Zack Lindsey.

22:03.792 --> 22:06.431
(Cheers, whistles, and applause)

22:06.551 --> 22:08.752
Zack was a great kid.

22:08.787 --> 22:11.255
Everybody around here loved him,

22:11.289 --> 22:13.757
Tommy included.

22:13.792 --> 22:15.759
(Esposito) Well,
the guy in the sketch

22:15.794 --> 22:17.461
is definitely Jimmy Lennon...

22:17.495 --> 22:19.129
Grand theft auto,

22:19.164 --> 22:21.598
conspiracy to sell
stolen vehicles,

22:21.633 --> 22:24.468
assault, assault with a
deadly weapon. (Beep)

22:24.502 --> 22:27.104
He immigrated to the U.S.
when he was 28,

22:27.138 --> 22:29.506
but he was born Janusz Lenadovsky

22:29.541 --> 22:30.974
in Minsk, Belarus.

22:31.009 --> 22:33.610
Belarus. I knew it.
That's right next to Lithuania.

22:33.645 --> 22:35.712
(Whirs)

22:35.747 --> 22:39.783
It says here that he owns
an auto repair shop on Avenview.

22:39.818 --> 22:42.419
Watch your backs on this one.
This guy is dangerous.

22:42.453 --> 22:45.556
(Buzzing)

22:50.094 --> 22:53.397
(Men arguing indistinctly)

22:53.431 --> 22:54.464
There.

22:54.499 --> 22:56.733
Jimmy Lennon.

22:56.768 --> 22:59.036
NYP... Hey!

23:00.939 --> 23:03.006
Hey!

23:03.041 --> 23:05.342
(Both grunt)

23:05.376 --> 23:08.111
(Grunts) Round up the others.
Call burglary/auto. (Handcuffs clicking)

23:08.146 --> 23:12.149
Hey! Hey! NYPD!

23:12.183 --> 23:15.571
This is clean business. I fix these cars.
Really?

23:15.691 --> 23:18.895
I bet the people who own them
would be surprised to hear that.

23:19.015 --> 23:21.959
Now I want to know about Zack Lindsey.
I know nothing.

23:21.993 --> 23:24.079
Not the best three words to have
falling out of your mouth, Jimmy.

23:24.199 --> 23:26.362
I was half expecting "moose"
and "squirrel."

23:26.482 --> 23:28.945
You're going to jail.
How long depends on you.

23:29.065 --> 23:30.954
Jail in your country is vacation.

23:31.074 --> 23:33.604
Then I will make it
very difficult.

23:33.638 --> 23:37.341
Here's what I think... I think
that Zack stole cars for you.

23:37.375 --> 23:40.043
But he had bigger plans,
and he told you he wanted out.

23:40.078 --> 23:42.546
You were worried
he couldn't keep his mouth shut,

23:42.580 --> 23:44.014
so you threatened him

23:44.048 --> 23:46.641
and told him,
there's no walking outta this.

23:46.761 --> 23:48.882
And when he didn't change
his mind, you followed him

23:49.002 --> 23:50.081
to the pool and you killed him.

23:50.201 --> 23:52.158
Is there anything
you want to add to that?

23:55.126 --> 23:58.395
You should help yourself, Jimmy.
This is your last chance.

23:58.429 --> 24:01.198
(Police radio chatter)

24:01.232 --> 24:03.033
Swim for gold.

24:03.067 --> 24:05.135
What?

24:05.169 --> 24:06.837
There's a car over there

24:06.871 --> 24:09.873
with the license plate
"swm4gld."

24:09.908 --> 24:11.708
(Fabric snaps)

24:11.743 --> 24:13.410
Oh-oh-oh-oh.

24:13.444 --> 24:15.812
This car is registered
to a Brian Morris

24:15.847 --> 24:18.315
of Greenwich, Connecticut.

24:18.383 --> 24:20.918
Brian Morris.
That's one of Zack's teammates.

24:20.952 --> 24:22.586
That's his main rival.

24:22.620 --> 24:26.223
So either Brian needed
his engine rebuilt or...

24:26.257 --> 24:28.258
Or this car is stolen.

24:28.293 --> 24:31.228
So why would Zack
steal Brian's car?

24:31.262 --> 24:34.398
I don't know. But I know why it
gave Brian a motive for murder.

24:34.432 --> 24:37.367
Those steroids we found
in Zack's apartment...

24:37.402 --> 24:39.903
Mm-hmm.
That he wasn't taking?

24:39.938 --> 24:41.939
Maybe they're Brian's.

24:51.883 --> 24:53.864
Why you got me in here?
I didn't do nothin' wrong.

24:53.984 --> 24:57.623
No? Zack's rival on
the swim team, Brian Morris,

24:57.743 --> 24:59.289
we found his stingray
at the chop shop...

24:59.324 --> 25:01.091
the one you stole.

25:01.125 --> 25:03.094
I don't even know
what that means.

25:03.613 --> 25:05.619
Zack's prints were on it,
and so were yours.

25:05.739 --> 25:07.286
So stop playing around.

25:08.694 --> 25:10.600
Why did you boost the car?

25:10.635 --> 25:14.204
(Sighs) Because Brian Morris
is a silver-spoon-licking punk.

25:14.238 --> 25:16.174
He hated Zack
for being a better swimmer.

25:16.294 --> 25:19.609
Two weeks ago, he spiked Zack's
pregame meal to make him sick.

25:19.644 --> 25:20.774
Zack won the meet anyway.

25:20.894 --> 25:22.769
Didn't take him long to
figure out it was Brian, though.

25:23.534 --> 25:27.665
So you took the car out of revenge?
"Swm4gld" vanity plates...

25:27.785 --> 25:29.720
I mean, can you get
any more douchey?

25:29.754 --> 25:32.020
Brian's up in Greenwich
with his own training pool,

25:32.077 --> 25:33.462
private coaches,
whatever he needs.

25:33.582 --> 25:36.469
Meanwhile Zack's stuck here
boosting cars just so he can eat

25:36.589 --> 25:38.304
'cause he can't take a nickel
of outside money

25:38.424 --> 25:40.931
or else he's done.
How did you find the steroids?

25:40.965 --> 25:42.499
You always search a car.

25:42.533 --> 25:44.801
You never want more
than you bargained for.

25:44.836 --> 25:47.437
Like a dead mobster in the trunk?
That stuff happens.

25:47.472 --> 25:48.699
We searched the car like always,

25:48.819 --> 25:49.983
Zack found a bag
underneath the seat,

25:50.103 --> 25:51.559
and he knew right then and there,
Brian was juicing.

25:51.679 --> 25:53.855
Did Zack have any plans
for this information?

25:53.975 --> 25:56.890
He hadn't figured that out yet.
Kind of a big deal, you know?

25:57.010 --> 25:58.966
I told him he should turn that
cheating bastard Brian in,

25:59.086 --> 26:01.924
get his ass banned.
Guess he never got the chance.

26:02.044 --> 26:05.170
I guess not.
Zack was supposed to be your friend, Tommy.

26:05.290 --> 26:07.080
Why didn't you tell us this
from the start?

26:08.526 --> 26:10.827
I don't know. Maybe...

26:10.862 --> 26:13.263
I was scared.

26:13.297 --> 26:15.332
All right. Stick around.

26:15.366 --> 26:17.734
I'm not done with you.
(Folder thuds)

26:17.769 --> 26:19.114
You recognize this, Brian?

26:19.234 --> 26:20.741
(Man) If it's gonna be adversarial
from the outset, detective...

26:20.861 --> 26:23.269
How's this for adversarial, counselor?

26:23.541 --> 26:26.009
Zack Lindsey was killed
after he found

26:26.044 --> 26:28.645
<i>a cache of illegal steroids</i>
<i>in your client's car.</i>

26:28.679 --> 26:30.480
<i>A car he apparently stole.</i>

26:30.515 --> 26:33.016
<i>And oddly enough, your son</i>
<i>never, ever reported it...</i>

26:33.051 --> 26:34.985
She's like a tiger in there.

26:35.019 --> 26:37.009
I never get tired of watching her.
Me neither.

26:37.129 --> 26:39.259
Seems like Alex Conrad
feels the same way.

26:39.379 --> 26:40.257
<i>...Was gone. </i>

26:40.377 --> 26:42.846
<i>A classic car worth
over 70 grand goes missing,</i>

26:42.966 --> 26:46.229
and you're telling me that
you had no idea it was gone?

26:46.264 --> 26:50.000
Why would I? I...
I barely even drive it.

26:50.034 --> 26:52.702
You <i>knew</i> that car was stolen.

26:52.737 --> 26:54.704
You didn't want
police to recover it

26:54.739 --> 26:57.274
in case they found more of these.
You have no proof of that.

26:57.308 --> 27:00.911
Zack could've planted
steroids in Brian's car.

27:00.945 --> 27:02.312
But he didn't.

27:02.346 --> 27:04.881
You know, I think that Zack
confronted you

27:04.916 --> 27:06.850
about those steroids.

27:06.884 --> 27:09.019
And you knew if he reported you,
you could kiss

27:09.053 --> 27:11.555
your olympic dreams good-bye,
and so you killed him.

27:11.589 --> 27:13.890
Brian, you killed Zack,

27:13.925 --> 27:16.993
and then you
broke into his apartment

27:17.028 --> 27:19.296
and tried to cover your tracks.

27:19.330 --> 27:20.864
(Clears throat)

27:20.898 --> 27:23.166
To my recollection,

27:23.201 --> 27:25.535
at no point did Zack Lindsey
and I discuss

27:25.570 --> 27:28.705
any performance-enhancing
substance.

27:28.739 --> 27:30.707
And I have no idea
who killed him.

27:30.741 --> 27:33.443
Not a gold medal performance,
Brian.

27:33.478 --> 27:35.645
Where were you
between 1:00 and 5:00 A.M.

27:35.680 --> 27:38.381
the night of the murder?
<i>We've been over all this.</i>

27:38.416 --> 27:40.317
<i>I was at the practice pool</i>
<i>at my parents' house.</i>

27:40.351 --> 27:43.587
This DVD is from a camera
mounted above the training pool.

27:43.621 --> 27:46.690
It has the date and time running in the corner.
Easily altered.

27:46.724 --> 27:49.092
Furthermore, the Morris family
and staff all swear

27:49.127 --> 27:52.329
Brian was at home, and I have affidavits.
I'm sure you do.

27:52.363 --> 27:56.066
So unless you're charging
my client, we're done here.

27:56.100 --> 27:59.035
My son will go to the Olympics,

27:59.070 --> 28:01.938
and no one's going to
derail that, detective.

28:01.973 --> 28:04.841
(People speaking indistinctly)

28:04.876 --> 28:06.843
Brian had means, he had motive.

28:06.878 --> 28:09.346
That's at least two.
What about opportunity?

28:09.380 --> 28:11.348
Clearly, his father would do
whatever it takes

28:11.382 --> 28:13.383
to cover for him
so he can keep on swimming.

28:13.417 --> 28:15.852
Well, with the kind of team
Brian had, there's no way

28:15.887 --> 28:18.622
we'll be able to prove that
he was at the U.N.Y. pool.

28:18.656 --> 28:20.524
Maybe because he wasn't.

28:20.558 --> 28:23.393
Look what kind of guy
Brian is... pampered,

28:23.427 --> 28:25.462
protected,
dominated by his father.

28:25.496 --> 28:27.464
This is not a man of action.

28:27.498 --> 28:28.544
So what are you suggesting?

28:28.664 --> 28:30.485
That he's not the kind of guy
to get his hands dirty.

28:30.605 --> 28:33.470
Maybe daddy cleaned up his mess.
Or he hired someone to do it for him.

28:33.538 --> 28:36.206
Ryan, can you look into
the Morris' financials?

28:36.240 --> 28:39.075
Look for large payments made
around the time of the murder,

28:39.110 --> 28:41.144
especially cash withdrawals.
Already on it.

28:41.179 --> 28:43.146
The dad is a hedge fund manager,

28:43.181 --> 28:45.882
so you practically need
an M.B.A. to follow the money.

28:45.917 --> 28:48.051
But there was something
about the kid.

28:48.085 --> 28:49.920
There was a bond.
As in bail bond?

28:49.954 --> 28:52.756
As in savings bond. Three days
after Brian's car was stolen,

28:52.790 --> 28:56.126
he cashed in a savings bond
in the amount of $25,000.

28:56.160 --> 28:58.662
That's enough to hire a hit man.

28:58.696 --> 29:00.463
Especially in today's
competitive job market.

29:00.498 --> 29:03.366
Did Brian Morris cash that bond
at Greenwich Federal Bank?

29:03.401 --> 29:06.036
Matter of fact, he did.
What do you got?

29:06.070 --> 29:08.004
We just searched
Thomas Marcone's place.

29:08.039 --> 29:10.207
Found tools
of the auto theft trade.

29:10.274 --> 29:12.309
But we also found this.

29:12.343 --> 29:13.977
That looks like 25 grand.

29:14.011 --> 29:16.546
And guess where it's from.

29:16.581 --> 29:19.182
Greenwich Federal Bank.

29:19.217 --> 29:21.518
I didn't kill Zack.
Tommy, it seems like

29:21.552 --> 29:24.020
every time you open your mouth,
another lie falls out.

29:24.055 --> 29:27.224
But I'm not lying. Then why did you
take 25 grand from Brian Morris?

29:27.258 --> 29:29.559
A man you characterized
as a "cheating bastard,"

29:29.594 --> 29:31.261
as I recall.

29:31.295 --> 29:33.230
Okay, I may have gotten
Zack killed,

29:33.264 --> 29:35.532
but not the way you think.

29:35.566 --> 29:38.768
It was blackmail.
You blackmailed Brian Morris.

29:38.803 --> 29:40.237
Him being on steroids...

29:40.271 --> 29:42.372
Yeah, I figured that knowledge
was worth something.

29:42.406 --> 29:44.541
Was Zack in on this?
He woulda kicked my ass

29:44.575 --> 29:48.178
up and down 18th Avenue if he found out.
And been justified.

29:48.212 --> 29:51.348
Look, Brian didn't know me,
and I figured, he wouldn't pay

29:51.382 --> 29:53.483
if he got blackmailed
by some anonymous mook.

29:53.517 --> 29:55.986
So you pretended to be Zack.

29:56.020 --> 29:58.488
I used the library computer
and Zack's e-mail account.

29:58.522 --> 29:59.923
I emailed Brian

29:59.957 --> 30:02.926
saying I had his 'roids
and I was gonna rat him out

30:02.960 --> 30:05.395
unless he put 25 grand
into a paper bag

30:05.429 --> 30:08.498
and left it underneath
a bench at the quad.

30:08.532 --> 30:11.201
When the coast was clear,
I picked it up.

30:11.235 --> 30:13.903
I never meant
for anyone to get hurt.

30:16.407 --> 30:20.243
I'd like that phone call now.

30:20.278 --> 30:24.014
Okay, so Zack stole Brian's stash

30:24.048 --> 30:26.016
and because of Tommy,

30:26.050 --> 30:31.655
Brian thought that Zack...
Was blackmailing him.

30:31.689 --> 30:36.226
Brian's motive just keeps
getting stronger and stronger.

30:36.260 --> 30:38.495
Almost like it's on steroids.

30:40.398 --> 30:43.033
Ms. Dinovi.
Tommy Marcone called,

30:43.067 --> 30:44.768
said you have him in here.

30:44.802 --> 30:47.370
He said Brian Morris killed my son.
We don't know all that.

30:47.405 --> 30:49.606
We just know he's a person of interest.
So why didn't you arrest him?

30:49.640 --> 30:52.375
We don't have enough to hold him.
And he's the son of a millionaire.

30:52.410 --> 30:54.878
I bet that doesn't hurt either.
Around here, it's about the evidence,

30:54.912 --> 30:56.746
not how fat someone's wallet is.

30:56.781 --> 30:58.748
Yeah, well,
I live in the real world,

30:58.783 --> 31:01.584
and I know that boy's family,
and they're gonna do

31:01.619 --> 31:06.122
whatever it takes to protect him
because they can.

31:06.157 --> 31:09.626
(Sniffles) Captain...
Zack's all I had.

31:09.660 --> 31:10.960
(Sobs)

31:10.995 --> 31:13.797
We can't figure out if Brian
is connected to the murder

31:13.831 --> 31:15.899
until we find the real killer.

31:15.933 --> 31:17.901
Then you're gonna
have to dig deeper.

31:17.935 --> 31:20.036
If Brian and his family
are involved, then there's

31:20.071 --> 31:23.206
gotta be a connection,
and I want it found.

31:30.848 --> 31:32.315
All right, great.
Thank you.

31:32.350 --> 31:34.417
We struck out again.
The Morris' house in Connecticut

31:34.452 --> 31:36.953
is gated,
and the security company says

31:36.987 --> 31:38.922
that nobody left
the night of the murder.

31:38.956 --> 31:41.358
These guys have everything covered.
Hmm.

31:41.392 --> 31:42.792
What?

31:42.827 --> 31:44.494
Zack's e-mail account,

31:44.528 --> 31:47.163
the one Tommy used
to ask Brian for a donation?

31:47.198 --> 31:49.299
The blackmail message was sent
at 3:02 P.M.

31:49.333 --> 31:53.136
You'd think that would've caused
a flurry of telephone calls.

31:53.170 --> 31:56.005
But he only made one call
right after... 3:19.

31:56.040 --> 31:59.376
That's the father's office
in New York.

31:59.410 --> 32:01.711
Do we have the dad's records?

32:01.746 --> 32:04.481
Yeah, I got it right here.
Starting at 3:21 P.M.,

32:04.515 --> 32:07.484
Benjamin Morris made
about a dozen phone calls,

32:07.518 --> 32:09.886
all to the same 2-1-2 number.

32:09.920 --> 32:12.222
Run it.

32:12.256 --> 32:15.358
It's a Dr. Rex Colabro.

32:15.393 --> 32:17.494
He's got
a sports medicine practice.

32:17.528 --> 32:20.463
He's got a lot of
big-time athletes as clients.

32:20.498 --> 32:22.132
So Benjamin Morris finds out

32:22.166 --> 32:24.701
that his son
is being blackmailed,

32:24.735 --> 32:27.537
and the one phone call
he makes is to Dr. Colabro?

32:27.571 --> 32:30.340
The only reason that
that would make sense is if...

32:30.374 --> 32:32.342
Dr. Colabro knew about
the steroids,

32:32.376 --> 32:33.910
maybe even supplied them.

32:33.944 --> 32:36.780
I don't supply steroids
to anyone.

32:36.814 --> 32:38.982
Never have. Never will.

32:39.016 --> 32:40.984
I've seen the long-term damage
they cause.

32:41.018 --> 32:43.086
As far as I'm concerned,
the stuff's poison.

32:43.120 --> 32:45.688
And what about Brian Morris?
Is he a patient of yours?

32:45.723 --> 32:48.291
That's confidential information.

32:50.127 --> 32:52.262
His father called you seven times

32:52.296 --> 32:54.998
in a 2-hour period
on Tuesday.

32:55.032 --> 32:58.034
What did the two of you talk about?
That's confidential as well.

32:58.068 --> 33:00.503
Dr. Colabro, your clientele
is mostly high-profile athletes.

33:00.538 --> 33:02.505
How fast do you think
they'll abandon ship

33:02.540 --> 33:05.408
once they find out you're talking with
us about steroids? I'm guessing fast.

33:05.443 --> 33:08.611
And when they find out
it's steroids and murder,

33:08.646 --> 33:12.348
it'll jump to light speed. Murder?
(Scoffs) You think I'm mixed up in a murder?

33:12.383 --> 33:14.851
I think that it would be
in your best interest

33:14.885 --> 33:16.853
to help us.
Tell us what you

33:16.887 --> 33:18.688
and Benjamin Morris talked about.

33:18.722 --> 33:20.857
And point of fact...

33:20.891 --> 33:25.361
Brian was your patient, but I'm
guessing his father was not.

33:25.429 --> 33:28.064
So confidentiality
really doesn't apply.

33:28.098 --> 33:29.732
How's this?

33:29.767 --> 33:33.102
Hypothetically...

33:33.137 --> 33:35.271
Why would an overbearing father

33:35.306 --> 33:37.774
of a steroid-using swimmer
call you?

33:37.808 --> 33:40.477
"Hypothetically"...

33:40.511 --> 33:43.313
He might have asked how long
a certain banned drug

33:43.347 --> 33:45.615
would remain detectable
in someone's system.

33:45.649 --> 33:48.585
Worried his son would test positive.
And what else might have come up?

33:48.619 --> 33:50.587
That the way an athlete
can avoid testing

33:50.621 --> 33:52.255
is if he's injured

33:52.289 --> 33:54.290
and temporarily withdraws
from the sport.

33:54.325 --> 33:55.425
Hypothetically.

33:55.459 --> 33:57.260
Hypothetically.

33:57.294 --> 34:00.563
I'll get a warrant, check
Colabro's office for steroids.

34:00.598 --> 34:02.065
You won't find any.

34:02.099 --> 34:04.067
Benjamin called in
to concoct a strategy

34:04.101 --> 34:05.735
to protect Brian's eligibility.

34:05.803 --> 34:08.170
This is damage control
not murder.

34:08.205 --> 34:11.174
Well, it looks like the strategy
has been put into effect.

34:11.208 --> 34:13.576
Brian quit the swim team,
said he injured his shoulder.

34:13.610 --> 34:16.646
No swim team, no drug testing.
Mm-hmm.

34:16.679 --> 34:18.648
So I checked Lanie's report
on the steroids

34:18.681 --> 34:20.449
against the file I got from Vice.

34:20.484 --> 34:23.353
They intercepted a shipment
of similar steroids

34:23.387 --> 34:26.822
that came to New York from a lab in Romania.
So let's look into Brian's life,

34:26.857 --> 34:29.259
see if there's any connection
to Romania.

34:29.293 --> 34:31.460
If we can find a connect,
then hopefully we'll be able

34:31.495 --> 34:33.630
to find Zack's killer.
Kate, you ready?

34:33.664 --> 34:36.299
Yeah. Um, let me
just go get my purse.

34:36.333 --> 34:38.301
You guys are going out
again tonight?

34:38.335 --> 34:40.303
What can I say?
She's a wealth of information.

34:40.337 --> 34:42.304
You are lucky to have her.

34:42.339 --> 34:44.474
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

34:44.507 --> 34:46.509
Too bad about tonight, though.

34:46.543 --> 34:47.976
Too bad how?

34:48.012 --> 34:51.114
Well, it's poker night. Lehane
and Connelly are in town.

34:51.148 --> 34:53.116
I thought
you might want to join us,

34:53.150 --> 34:54.851
but if you have plans.
No way. You're...

34:54.971 --> 34:56.792
You're inviting me
to your mystery writers' poker night?

34:56.911 --> 34:58.732
Well, come on.
You're a mystery writer now, right?

34:58.989 --> 35:01.324
Yeah, but those guys
are legendary. I mean, uh...

35:01.358 --> 35:03.226
(laughs) Yeah.
Yeah, they are.

35:03.260 --> 35:06.162
Ah, well.
If you're unavailable...

35:06.196 --> 35:08.131
(Whispering)
Three, two, one.

35:08.165 --> 35:09.632
Well, wait, wait, wait.

35:09.667 --> 35:11.901
Bingo.

35:11.936 --> 35:14.470
Hang on a second.

35:14.505 --> 35:17.440
(Normal voice)
Oh, yeah.

35:17.474 --> 35:20.510
They're gonna <i>love</i> you.

35:20.544 --> 35:23.413
Gentlemen.
This the new guy?

35:23.447 --> 35:25.982
Alex Conrad, Michael Connelly,
Dennis Lehane.

35:26.016 --> 35:27.984
It's really awesome
to meet you guys.

35:28.018 --> 35:29.519
I am a, uh, huge fan.

35:29.553 --> 35:33.056
It's not a book signing, kid.
We're here to play poker.

35:33.090 --> 35:34.691
Right.

35:34.725 --> 35:36.726
Ah, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh.

35:36.760 --> 35:38.595
That's Cannell's seat.

35:38.629 --> 35:40.430
Oh.
That's the rule.

35:40.464 --> 35:44.033
We lose a member,
nobody sits there for a year.

35:45.603 --> 35:47.337
Okay.

35:47.371 --> 35:49.038
Sorry.

35:49.073 --> 35:52.442
So we were just talking about
our books becoming movies.

35:52.476 --> 35:54.110
Michael had "Lincoln Lawyer,"

35:54.144 --> 35:57.180
I had "Shutter Island,"
Ricky has "Heat Wave."

35:57.214 --> 35:59.182
So what about your book, kid?

35:59.216 --> 36:01.184
They gonna make it into a movie?

36:01.218 --> 36:03.920
Oh, uh, not yet.

36:03.954 --> 36:06.889
So, Ricky, what's going on
with the dead swimmer?

36:06.924 --> 36:08.858
Treading water.
Dennis, your bet.

36:08.892 --> 36:11.461
Well, it reads like
a crime of passion to me.

36:11.495 --> 36:14.764
I bet the girlfriend did it.
The girlfriend? You're kidding, right?

36:14.798 --> 36:18.034
(Chips clatter) You move through the
girlfriend no later than page 50.

36:18.068 --> 36:20.303
(Dennis) Yeah, the woman scored
is like the oldest rodeo clown

36:20.337 --> 36:22.905
in the book.
Is he serious?

36:22.940 --> 36:25.942
Oh, he's "dead serious."

36:25.976 --> 36:28.378
Well, you know, I just thought we were...
How many books have you written?

36:28.412 --> 36:30.747
Just the one.
(Dennis) And this...

36:30.781 --> 36:32.815
And this one book made you,
like, a crime-solving genius,

36:32.850 --> 36:35.451
did it? You know what I did
after I wrote my first novel?

36:35.486 --> 36:39.055
Hmm?
I shut up and I wrote 23 more.

36:39.089 --> 36:40.456
(Chuckles)

36:40.491 --> 36:42.279
I can tell ya, a case like this,

36:42.399 --> 36:45.061
guilty party is usually
the guy with the biggest secret.

36:45.095 --> 36:46.238
You know, Dennis is right.

36:46.358 --> 36:48.571
Aside from Brian, who has
the most to lose

36:48.691 --> 36:50.238
if this steroid use gets out?

36:53.604 --> 36:56.039
You know,
I think I might just know.

37:02.380 --> 37:03.965
This is ridiculous.

37:04.085 --> 37:06.398
I was in my apartment
in faculty housing that night.

37:06.518 --> 37:07.546
You could just ask around.

37:07.666 --> 37:09.336
We know you were
in your apartment that night.

37:09.456 --> 37:12.027
Okay. So then why am I here?
Do you know what this is, coach?

37:12.147 --> 37:14.091
Uh, yeah.
Everybody in my business does.

37:14.211 --> 37:15.939
But nobody on my team takes that stuff.

37:16.059 --> 37:17.007
Brian Morris does.

37:17.127 --> 37:20.068
That's not true.
Apparently, this is his steroid of choice.

37:20.188 --> 37:21.623
It comes from Romania.

37:21.743 --> 37:24.586
I understand you've been to Romania four
times in the past two years.

37:24.706 --> 37:26.937
My wife's family is from Bucharest.

37:27.057 --> 37:28.908
So you're trying to tell me,
it's just a coincidence?

37:29.028 --> 37:31.507
- Yeah. - So if I search your apartment
and your office,

37:31.542 --> 37:35.478
you're telling me that I wouldn't find
<i>any</i> of these vials?

37:41.575 --> 37:42.645
You don't understand.

37:42.674 --> 37:44.552
Brian Morris was a lock to win it all.

37:45.218 --> 37:46.147
He had the body,

37:46.267 --> 37:49.005
he had the talent, the money
to make himself the best.

37:49.125 --> 37:50.992
He's the reason I came
to coach at U.N.Y.,

37:51.112 --> 37:53.095
but last year, Brian peaked,

37:53.215 --> 37:54.726
started fading
at the ends of races,

37:54.846 --> 37:56.762
and from outta nowhere, Zack became
the guy to beat.

37:56.882 --> 37:58.697
So you decided
to give Brian an extra  boost

37:58.734 --> 38:01.204
so he could catch up with Zack.
Brian's father came to me.

38:01.739 --> 38:03.575
He asked if there was
anything more I could do,

38:03.695 --> 38:05.547
he said he'd donate millions
to the program

38:05.667 --> 38:06.591
if that answer was yes.

38:06.711 --> 38:08.881
Yeah, but it wasn't just
about the money, was it?

38:09.001 --> 38:12.562
Every coach knows, he has to
hitch his wagon to a star.

38:12.682 --> 38:15.891
In fact, you'd done it before,
with somebody very special.

38:16.407 --> 38:19.856
Before going to U.N.Y.,
you were coaching in Wilmington.

38:19.890 --> 38:21.735
That's right. So?

38:21.855 --> 38:24.467
You ever give that same boost
to your swimmers there?

38:25.709 --> 38:28.531
They keep those old samples,
don't they?

38:31.681 --> 38:33.798
Thanks so much, Rocket.
We really appreciate it.

38:33.918 --> 38:37.073
Oh, thank you so much
for the interview.

38:37.107 --> 38:38.681
Detective Beckett,
Mr. Castle.

38:38.801 --> 38:40.608
How goes the investigation?
Any new leads?

38:40.728 --> 38:42.879
Actually, we think
we caught a break.

38:42.913 --> 38:45.348
Well, that's great.
Mm-hmm.

38:45.382 --> 38:47.683
Yes, it is. Well,
for everyone except you.

38:47.718 --> 38:50.604
I... I don't...

38:50.724 --> 38:52.421
Drop the act, Rob.

38:52.456 --> 38:54.557
We know how you got to be
the Rocket.

38:54.591 --> 38:57.059
Coach Rome told us about
how he gave you rocket fuel

38:57.094 --> 38:58.594
back in Wilmington

38:58.629 --> 39:01.564
and didn't stop
until you went all the way.

39:01.598 --> 39:03.283
What the hell
are you talking about?

39:03.403 --> 39:05.803
I have never juiced. I have
the test results to prove it.

39:05.923 --> 39:08.660
Yeah, but they weren't
testing for the right thing.

39:08.780 --> 39:10.208
We checked your blood samples

39:10.335 --> 39:11.669
from the last gold medal race
you won

39:11.789 --> 39:16.006
against the designer steroids
that Zack found in Brian's car.

39:16.040 --> 39:18.976
It came back positive.
There was a mistake.

39:19.010 --> 39:21.347
And then off of that,
we got a warrant

39:21.467 --> 39:23.480
to search your hotel room,
where we found

39:23.515 --> 39:25.916
a shirt with chlorine on it...
pure chlorine...

39:25.950 --> 39:27.584
the kind that killed Zack.

39:27.619 --> 39:29.620
We're waiting for D.N.A.
test results right now.

39:29.654 --> 39:32.656
No, I was at Buddha Bar
the whole night.

39:32.690 --> 39:35.659
And it was packed there.
You could've easily slipped out

39:35.693 --> 39:37.728
and come back
without anyone noticing.

39:40.598 --> 39:43.000
(Scoffs)
This is ridiculous.

39:43.034 --> 39:45.002
Why would I kill Zack?

39:45.036 --> 39:47.571
Because when Zack found steroids
in Brian's car,

39:47.605 --> 39:49.606
he was conflicted
about what to do.

39:49.641 --> 39:51.241
So he sought counsel

39:51.276 --> 39:53.744
from the one guy
he knew he could trust...

39:53.778 --> 39:56.725
Captain America,
chest full of medals,

39:56.845 --> 39:58.081
guy on the cereal box.

39:58.116 --> 40:01.518
Only you realized,
coach Rome had given Brian

40:01.553 --> 40:03.264
the same steroids
he had given to you.

40:03.384 --> 40:06.128
And you knew that if Zack talked,
you would be found out.

40:06.248 --> 40:08.398
They'd erase your name
from the record books.

40:08.518 --> 40:09.847
They'd take away all your medals.

40:09.967 --> 40:12.129
You would lose everything.

40:12.163 --> 40:15.966
And there was no way
you were gonna let that happen.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.168
Turn around.
(Handcuffs click)

40:18.203 --> 40:20.204
Take a long look, Rob.

40:20.238 --> 40:22.206
Where you're going...
(Clicking)

40:22.240 --> 40:25.075
I don't think they have pools.
Let's go.

40:25.109 --> 40:27.110
(Castle)
You know, it is ironic...

40:27.145 --> 40:29.646
The one man Zack thought
he could trust... his mentor...

40:29.681 --> 40:31.015
turned out to be his killer.

40:31.135 --> 40:34.677
Yeah, speaking of mentor,
I heard that you guys

40:34.797 --> 40:36.153
were pretty hard
on Conrad last night.

40:36.187 --> 40:37.654
Hard on him?

40:37.689 --> 40:40.457
No, no, it was just
a little friendly hazing.

40:40.492 --> 40:42.526
To hear him describe it,
it sounds like

40:42.560 --> 40:46.129
someone was trying to teach him a lesson.
(Laughs) What? Why would I want to do that?

40:46.164 --> 40:48.765
Because you didn't want him
to spend time with me.

40:48.800 --> 40:50.968
That is completely...
True?

40:51.002 --> 40:53.971
(People speaking indistinctly)

40:54.005 --> 40:55.873
Yes. Fine.

40:55.907 --> 40:58.008
It's true. I'm jealous.

40:58.042 --> 40:59.943
There. I said it.

40:59.978 --> 41:01.612
I...

41:01.646 --> 41:03.614
I want you all to myself,

41:03.648 --> 41:06.250
and to have you spending time
with another writer,

41:06.284 --> 41:07.751
that upsets me.

41:07.785 --> 41:10.754
And if... if that
makes me petty, so be it.

41:10.788 --> 41:13.757
Guilty as charged.

41:15.326 --> 41:19.463
Actually, I kinda think
it's sweet.

41:19.497 --> 41:21.031
You do?

41:21.065 --> 41:22.699
I do.

41:22.734 --> 41:24.701
And that's why
you don't have to worry

41:24.736 --> 41:26.703
about me hanging around
with Conrad anymore.

41:26.738 --> 41:30.040
From now on,
I am a one-writer girl.

41:30.074 --> 41:31.675
I do feel kinda bad.

41:31.709 --> 41:35.312
He is my mentee after all. He
really didn't do anything wrong.

41:35.346 --> 41:38.048
I wouldn't feel so bad.
(Laughter)

41:38.082 --> 41:40.050
And then he said,
"They used to do this to me

41:40.084 --> 41:42.986
for talking in class."
(Esposito, Ryan, and Conrad laugh)

41:43.021 --> 41:45.489
True story. Hey, since, uh,
we, uh, closed the case,

41:45.523 --> 41:48.158
uh, we figured we'd take Conrad
on a little field trip

41:48.192 --> 41:50.360
up to Rikers. 
Yeah, I have a pretty heavy prison scene

41:50.395 --> 41:52.529
in "Seriously Dead," and I want
to get all the facts right.

41:52.564 --> 41:55.065
Will you still send me
your writer's draft?

41:55.099 --> 41:57.801
Yes, as soon as I change the killer.
Girlfriend?

41:57.835 --> 42:00.237
Rookie mistake.

42:00.271 --> 42:03.040
It was nice to meet you, Alex.
You, too.

42:03.074 --> 42:05.075
(Ryan) Come on.

42:05.109 --> 42:08.478
So... a dude can be a muse,
right, bro?

42:08.513 --> 42:11.515
I mean, that's not weird
or anything, is it?

42:11.549 --> 42:14.084
No, it's not weird.
No. Mnh-mnh.

42:14.118 --> 42:16.420
Nah. Yeah.

42:16.454 --> 42:18.822
That's a little weird.

42:18.856 --> 42:20.524
Yeah. (Chuckles)

42:22.527 --> 42:24.895
Thank you.

42:24.929 --> 42:26.830
Always.

42:36.874 --> 42:38.775
Oh.
