are pretty.

12:42.688 --> 12:44.265
What kind of plant is that?

12:44.348 --> 12:45.650
That's Wolfsbane.

12:45.850 --> 12:47.685
I planted it for my abuelita.

12:48.102 --> 12:50.570
Look at how big this glow-melon is.

12:50.770 --> 12:54.200
I love glow-melons.
They're so sweet and tasty.

12:54.400 --> 12:55.450
And glowy!

12:55.650 --> 12:56.993
Can we eat that one now?

12:57.193 --> 12:58.203
I wish.

12:58.403 --> 13:01.165
But it isn't ripe yet. It needs
more moonlight.

13:01.365 --> 13:03.533
Ah. I like gardening.

13:03.742 --> 13:05.618
But I don't like waiting.

13:05.870 --> 13:09.423
Katya. Don't you have a spell
to make our garden grow faster?

13:09.623 --> 13:12.458
Sorry, Drac. My magic
doesn't work like that.

13:12.542 --> 13:16.047
Witches have to be patient,
and wait for their gardens to grow.

13:16.130 --> 13:17.590
Just like everybody else.

13:17.882 --> 13:21.052
Well, maybe not everybody.

Those fruits and vegetables
are almost ready to eat.

13:27.642 --> 13:31.070
They are. But we still have
a lot of work to do.

-A nibbler? What's that?
-What's a nibbler?

15:10.535 --> 15:12.538
A nibbler is a garden pest

15:12.622 --> 15:16.292
that keeps nibbling and nibbling
until it's eaten everything.

15:18.335 --> 15:19.678
I don't see anything.

15:19.878 --> 15:22.263
Nibblers are very good at hiding.

15:22.463 --> 15:23.807
They're hard to find.

15:24.007 --> 15:26.185
And even harder to catch.

15:26.268 --> 15:29.388
But as long as the nibbler
is hiding, it's not nibbling.

15:29.472 --> 15:31.315
And that means the garden
is safe for now.

15:31.515 --> 15:33.567

15:33.650 --> 15:36.853

16:16.893 --> 16:18.228
