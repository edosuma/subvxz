00:09.280 --> 00:50.690
NARRATOR: And now, DreamWorks--
"The Penguins of Madagascar."

00:50.690 --> 00:52.400
-Cute and cuddly, boys.

01:07.530 --> 01:10.550
Ah, a brand new
baby day is born.

01:10.550 --> 01:12.970
Freshly spanked,
full of promise,

01:12.970 --> 01:16.090
adventure, and the hope
of inflicting pain.

01:16.090 --> 01:18.350
-Yay, pain!

01:18.350 --> 01:20.350
-Good morning, baby day.

01:20.350 --> 01:24.050
--[SIGHS] But Skipper, why do
we have to start so early?

01:24.050 --> 01:25.850
Wouldn't the promise
and hope still

01:25.850 --> 01:29.260
be there if we waited
until sunup to exercise?

01:29.260 --> 01:29.960
-Maybe, Kowalski.

01:29.960 --> 01:32.110
But why take the chance?

01:32.110 --> 01:33.820
All right, gentlemen,
toe touches.

01:33.820 --> 01:35.300
Remember not to bend your knees.

01:35.300 --> 01:36.240
-Have we got knees?

01:42.010 --> 01:43.320
-Ah, Carlotta.

01:43.320 --> 01:46.840
I like the way
you touch my feet.

01:59.980 --> 02:01.500
Hey, Maurice!

02:01.500 --> 02:03.380
I'm not adequately sleeped.

02:03.380 --> 02:07.300
Hit the sun's snooze button.

02:07.300 --> 02:08.810
Maurice, I'm decreeing.

02:08.810 --> 02:09.510
Maurice!

02:09.510 --> 02:11.710
Why are you not here?

02:11.710 --> 02:12.940
-I'm here.

02:12.940 --> 02:13.630
Woah!

02:17.050 --> 02:18.500
-Maurice!

02:18.500 --> 02:20.380
Hello!

02:20.380 --> 02:21.720
Maurice!

02:21.720 --> 02:23.840
-He was my right hand man.

02:23.840 --> 02:26.820
And now my right
hand is left manless.

02:29.410 --> 02:30.550
There he is.

02:30.550 --> 02:31.250
Come, Mort.

02:31.250 --> 02:34.580
I shall give Maurice's
tongue a lashing.

02:34.580 --> 02:35.460
-OK, listen up.

02:35.460 --> 02:39.380
Now, here's how it will go down.

02:39.380 --> 02:41.320
-What is Morris doing?

02:45.180 --> 02:46.930
-Now, we've got to keep
this one the hush hush.

02:46.930 --> 02:47.630
-Gotcha.

02:55.990 --> 02:57.280
-Not a word to Julien.

02:57.280 --> 02:59.330
We don't want him
to see this coming.

02:59.330 --> 03:00.180
-OK.

03:00.180 --> 03:03.220
-Trust me, this will knock
him right off his throat.

03:06.700 --> 03:07.690
-All right, baby.

03:07.690 --> 03:08.390
-Yeah.

03:08.390 --> 03:11.680
We're going to blow
King Julien away.

03:11.680 --> 03:16.790
--[GASPS] I have been a good
king, have I not, Mort?

03:16.790 --> 03:20.700
-Well, I could use
more foot time.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.420
You are the best king ever.

03:22.420 --> 03:26.130
-So why would Maurice
be savagely plotting

03:26.130 --> 03:29.610
to knock me off
and blow me away?

03:29.610 --> 03:33.290
-Maybe he's planning a
surprise party for you.

03:33.290 --> 03:35.090
-But is it my birthday?

03:35.090 --> 03:36.810
Is it King Julien day?

03:36.810 --> 03:38.740
Is it Julien day?

03:38.740 --> 03:42.270
-No, and no, and maybe.

03:44.870 --> 03:47.170
-So Maurice could
not be planning

03:47.170 --> 03:49.870
a surprise party
for me, could he?

03:49.870 --> 03:56.300
No, the real surprise is Maurice
wants to put me six feet under.

03:56.300 --> 03:58.370
-I'd like to be under six feet.

04:01.240 --> 04:04.380
-This fiendish plot
will be foiled.

04:04.380 --> 04:06.000
Maybe plastic wraps, too.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.580
Mort, we must train for battle.

04:11.370 --> 04:14.310
Cadet No Class Mort,
are the coconuts ready?

04:14.310 --> 04:17.410
-Yes, Generalissimo King Julien.

04:17.410 --> 04:21.580
-Ready, aim, throw the coconuts!

04:21.580 --> 04:22.730
Yes, stinky Maurice.

04:22.730 --> 04:24.610
You are stinky!

04:24.610 --> 04:31.020
You make my nose turn
with your stinky stink!

04:31.020 --> 04:32.780
-Take that, traitor!

04:32.780 --> 04:36.570
How are you liking me now?

04:36.570 --> 04:38.010
-Oops.

04:38.010 --> 04:39.910
It was a good throw, though.

04:39.910 --> 04:41.200
-Situps, 50 reps.

04:41.200 --> 04:41.900
Ready?

04:41.900 --> 04:44.350
And--

04:44.350 --> 04:46.280
-Sad Eyes, what gives?

04:46.280 --> 04:47.520
-I think I'm a coconut.

04:47.520 --> 04:48.690
-Mort, you dud.

04:48.690 --> 04:50.270
You made me miss.

04:50.270 --> 04:50.970
-Sorry.

04:50.970 --> 04:53.550
Sorry, Generalissimo
King Julien!

04:53.550 --> 04:54.450
-Whoa, whoa!

04:54.450 --> 04:55.620
Oh, wait a minute.

04:55.620 --> 04:56.910
Generalissimo?

04:56.910 --> 04:58.290
-That's right, baby.

04:58.290 --> 04:59.580
Check me out.

04:59.580 --> 05:02.380
I, too, am a military guy.

05:02.380 --> 05:04.420
[MUMBLES]

05:06.710 --> 05:10.550
-You are a disgrace to the
uniform-- even that uniform.

05:10.550 --> 05:12.870
-Which is a disgrace
unto itself.

05:12.870 --> 05:14.560
-Why do you even need a uniform?

05:14.560 --> 05:15.910
-Because Maurice
has turned traitor,

05:15.910 --> 05:18.800
and he's getting the
whole zoo, and [INAUDIBLE]

05:18.800 --> 05:20.520
is forming a violent mob.

05:20.520 --> 05:24.310
Kings and violent mobs are
natural enemies in the wild.

05:24.310 --> 05:25.830
-But that doesn't make sense.

05:25.830 --> 05:27.600
Maurice is incredibly
devoted to you.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.770
-Beyond reason or merit.

05:29.770 --> 05:30.620
-All right, Ringtail.

05:30.620 --> 05:34.120
We'll look into this
cockamamie conspiracy of yours.

05:34.120 --> 05:36.350
-OK, this is good.

05:36.350 --> 05:39.280
Can I have my
Generalissimo hat back?

05:39.280 --> 05:41.020
-No.

05:41.020 --> 05:42.660
-Violent mob.

05:42.660 --> 05:45.790
If there was such a thing,
I would have started it.

05:45.790 --> 05:48.110
-Everybody get a
pitchfork and a torch.

05:48.110 --> 05:51.000
And remember, not a
peep to King Julien.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.510
This is going to slay him.

05:52.510 --> 05:54.980
[CHEERING]

05:56.620 --> 05:57.810
-Sweet civil unrest!

05:57.810 --> 05:58.770
Ringtail was right.

05:58.770 --> 06:00.750
-But Skipper, don't
you think there might

06:00.750 --> 06:02.830
be some other
innocent explanation?

06:02.830 --> 06:04.280
-Do the maths, Private.

06:04.280 --> 06:07.930
-Pitchforks plus torches
plus mob invariably equals--

06:07.930 --> 06:08.830
-Revolution!

06:08.830 --> 06:12.630
So now you are seeing the
plotting, seeing the scheming.

06:12.630 --> 06:14.820
You're seeing the
rousing of the rebels.

06:14.820 --> 06:16.380
-I still have a
hard time believing

06:16.380 --> 06:17.870
Maurice could turn traitor.

06:17.870 --> 06:20.130
-In a twisted way,
it makes sense.

06:20.130 --> 06:24.330
You see, for a mammal, Maurice
is extraordinarily intelligent.

06:24.330 --> 06:27.250
-Might want to wait a while
before you go back in there.

06:27.250 --> 06:31.130
-Meanwhile, Julien is
extraordinarily not.

06:31.130 --> 06:33.270
-Stop staring at me, buddy.

06:33.270 --> 06:35.150
You better step off.

06:35.150 --> 06:38.210
-Julien, that's a stuffed fish.

06:38.210 --> 06:38.910
-Burn!

06:38.910 --> 06:39.970
He got you good.

06:39.970 --> 06:41.540
Admit it.

06:41.540 --> 06:43.500
-This red line shows
the frustration level

06:43.500 --> 06:45.970
of a really smart person
forced to take orders

06:45.970 --> 06:48.200
from some dunder-brained boob.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.290
As you can see, the
frustration just

06:50.290 --> 06:52.910
keeps rising and
rising and rising.

06:52.910 --> 06:56.190
I mean, why don't they put
the smart guy in charge, huh?

06:56.190 --> 06:57.740
It doesn't make any sense!

06:57.740 --> 07:00.990
Something has got
to give, people!

07:00.990 --> 07:04.850
Am I the only one seeing this?

07:04.850 --> 07:06.110
-Great, love the passion.

07:06.110 --> 07:08.780
Message went right over.

07:08.780 --> 07:09.480
-Yeah.

07:09.480 --> 07:12.090
Someday there will
be genius justice.

07:12.090 --> 07:13.680
-So, what do we do, Skipper?

07:13.680 --> 07:14.380
-Nothing.

07:14.380 --> 07:17.510
I have my royal defence
force to protect me.

07:17.510 --> 07:18.210
Mort!

07:23.880 --> 07:25.260
-I smell fishies!

07:25.260 --> 07:26.900
-Yeah, that's not going to work.

07:26.900 --> 07:30.120
-Now, it's no secret that
I don't care for Ringtail.

07:30.120 --> 07:31.700
-Likewise, [MUMBLES].

07:31.700 --> 07:35.670
-But we can't stand by while an
angry mob shreds him to pieces.

07:35.670 --> 07:36.950
-Sweetness!

07:36.950 --> 07:39.870
Set my alarm for when my
enemies have been crushed.

07:39.870 --> 07:40.870
-Negative!

07:40.870 --> 07:42.740
You're going to
fully participate

07:42.740 --> 07:45.330
in this joint penguin
lemur operation.

07:45.330 --> 07:47.970
-But Skipper, I'm a
lover, not a fighter.

07:47.970 --> 07:50.440
-Don't worry about
that, Ringtail.

07:50.440 --> 07:53.510
Basic training will kick
the love right out of you.

07:53.510 --> 07:55.610
-You keep dreaming.

07:55.610 --> 07:57.570
One.

07:57.570 --> 07:58.270
Two.

07:58.270 --> 07:59.630
-Let me hear it, soldier.

07:59.630 --> 08:01.010
-This is my pea shooter.

08:01.010 --> 08:03.490
There are many like it,
but this one is mine.

08:10.520 --> 08:11.220
-Yummy peas.

08:13.940 --> 08:15.880
-Ten.

08:15.880 --> 08:16.790
Eleven.

08:16.790 --> 08:18.490
-(SINGING) I don't
know, but I've been

08:18.490 --> 08:21.980
told Antarctica is mighty cold.

08:25.820 --> 08:26.520
-Nineteen.

08:29.210 --> 08:30.370
Twenty!

08:30.370 --> 08:31.270
-OK.

08:31.270 --> 08:33.140
So maybe we don't put
them on the front lines.

08:35.820 --> 08:39.670
Men, as you know, the best
defence is a good offence.

08:39.670 --> 08:44.970
-And no one is more
offensive than you.

08:44.970 --> 08:46.440
You are so snapped!

08:49.370 --> 08:50.790
Please continue.

08:50.790 --> 08:54.100
-We'll strike before Maurice's
little coup gets too cuckoo.

08:54.100 --> 08:58.260
Gentlemen, Operation "We're
Really Helping Julien, Really?"

08:58.260 --> 09:00.090
is a go.

09:00.090 --> 09:01.960
-So, where is the king?

09:01.960 --> 09:05.110
-I am dying to spring
this surprise already.

09:05.110 --> 09:06.260
-I don't know where he is.

09:06.260 --> 09:07.750
But he should be here soon.

09:07.750 --> 09:10.400
-Oh, I already am.

09:10.400 --> 09:11.100
Surprised?

09:11.100 --> 09:12.300
Traitors!

09:12.300 --> 09:13.570
Traitors!

09:13.570 --> 09:15.820
-Rico, drop the
not-so-smart ball.

09:22.450 --> 09:24.510
-Get it off, get
it off, get it off!

09:24.510 --> 09:27.330
-This is not going to end well.

09:27.330 --> 09:28.700
-OK, boys.

09:28.700 --> 09:29.490
Let's get in the game.

09:40.020 --> 09:42.770
-This will teach you
to be a traitor, snake!

09:42.770 --> 09:43.990
-Wait, wait!

09:43.990 --> 09:45.410
What?

09:45.410 --> 09:48.170
-Everybody, knock it off!

09:48.170 --> 09:50.500
-What do you mean, traitorous?

09:50.500 --> 09:52.710
-Oh, don't play dummy with me.

09:52.710 --> 09:55.370
I know what you are
planning here, Maurice.

09:55.370 --> 09:56.300
-You do?

09:56.300 --> 09:57.770
Oh, man.

09:57.770 --> 09:59.640
Who blabbed about
the surprise party?

09:59.640 --> 10:00.340
-Yes.

10:00.340 --> 10:02.530
I know all about your--
wait, traitors say what?

10:08.380 --> 10:10.240
-Oh.

10:10.240 --> 10:12.620
Oops.

10:12.620 --> 10:14.320
-Surprise party?

10:14.320 --> 10:15.080
For who?

10:15.080 --> 10:15.780
-You.

10:15.780 --> 10:17.740
Remember what you
said on your birthday

10:17.740 --> 10:20.120
when I threw you that
big, old surprise party?

10:20.120 --> 10:23.070
-Well, of course I'm
not surprised, Maurice.

10:23.070 --> 10:24.870
It's my birthday.

10:24.870 --> 10:26.940
You know when it
might be a surprise?

10:26.940 --> 10:28.750
When it's not my birthday!

10:28.750 --> 10:30.690
-Surprise!

10:30.690 --> 10:33.590
Was he surprised?

10:33.590 --> 10:34.820
-Oh yeah.

10:34.820 --> 10:36.280
Forgot about that.

10:36.280 --> 10:37.720
-I tried to tell you.

10:37.720 --> 10:38.610
-But wait a minute.

10:38.610 --> 10:40.780
Why all the pitchforks
and torches?

10:40.780 --> 10:42.630
-Yeah, Maurice.

10:42.630 --> 10:45.750
How do you explain the
traditional angry mob

10:45.750 --> 10:47.220
trappings?

10:47.220 --> 10:49.290
-Remember what you said
right after the last thing

10:49.290 --> 10:50.210
you forgot you said?

10:50.210 --> 10:50.910
-Wait.

10:50.910 --> 10:53.050
After the last
thing I just said?

10:53.050 --> 10:53.750
Hang on.

10:53.750 --> 10:55.820
Let me see.

10:55.820 --> 11:01.630
And give the party a crazy mash
up theme like, I don't know,

11:01.630 --> 11:04.480
hillbilly meets
tiki or something.

11:04.480 --> 11:06.930
-Oh yeah.

11:06.930 --> 11:08.170
Forgot about that, too.

11:08.170 --> 11:11.090
-So this is all completely
innocent after all?

11:11.090 --> 11:12.570
Yay for innocence!

11:12.570 --> 11:14.380
But wait, why
weren't we invited?

11:14.380 --> 11:18.110
-Remember what you said right
after he said what he said?

11:18.110 --> 11:22.390
-Say, when you get around to
having this hillbilly tiki

11:22.390 --> 11:27.850
mash up surprise party,
do not invite us!

11:27.850 --> 11:28.980
Ah, yes.

11:28.980 --> 11:30.080
I remember that.

11:30.080 --> 11:30.780
-Come on, men.

11:30.780 --> 11:31.780
We're bugging out.

11:31.780 --> 11:32.900
-Wait, don't go.

11:32.900 --> 11:36.030
If there's someone I would
want at my not birthday

11:36.030 --> 11:38.540
hillbilly tiki
surprise party, it

11:38.540 --> 11:41.160
is you-- the penguin
who taught me

11:41.160 --> 11:45.580
what it means to be an
officer and a gentleman.

11:45.580 --> 11:47.730
-Oh, Ringtail, when
you put it that way,

11:47.730 --> 11:50.580
I can only say drop and
give me 20, soldier!

11:50.580 --> 11:51.450
-Yes, sir.

11:51.450 --> 11:53.410

11:53.410 --> 11:55.850

three, and four.

(SINGING)

12:14.420 --> 12:15.110
-OK.

12:15.110 --> 12:18.140
We've seen the rhino, the
otter, and the penguins.

12:18.140 --> 12:19.900
-Hey, you know,
wasn't there something

12:19.900 --> 12:21.200
weird about those penguins?

12:21.200 --> 12:22.280
-What do you mean?

12:22.280 --> 12:25.110
-Like, were they
doing taekwondo?

12:25.110 --> 12:26.790
-He knows too much.

12:26.790 --> 12:28.550
-Take your shot.

12:28.550 --> 12:30.040
-What?

12:30.040 --> 12:31.460
That's crazy talk.

12:31.460 --> 12:34.050
-Yeah, I guess you're right.

12:34.050 --> 12:34.740
-Abort!

12:42.300 --> 12:47.160
-I've always wanted to
dabble in the visual arts.

12:47.160 --> 12:47.860
-Let's bug out.

12:54.790 --> 12:58.260
-What happened?

12:58.260 --> 13:00.020
I'm OK.

13:00.020 --> 13:00.750
I'm OK.

13:09.380 --> 13:11.390
-I've done it!

13:11.390 --> 13:13.970
I've just designed a
pocket hyperbolic quantum

13:13.970 --> 13:16.880
accelerator that will
save civilisation.

13:16.880 --> 13:19.750
-Well, that earns
a big 'atta boy.

13:19.750 --> 13:20.500
-Gosh.

13:20.500 --> 13:23.460
-There is, however, a 50%
chance the pocket hyperbolic

13:23.460 --> 13:26.740
quantum accelerator could
actually destroy civilisation.

13:26.740 --> 13:30.590
-I see one major problem with
your invention, Kowalski.

13:30.590 --> 13:31.680
We don't have pockets.

13:31.680 --> 13:34.700
-Skipper, couldn't the 50%
chance of worldwide destruction

13:34.700 --> 13:36.680
be a problem, too?

13:36.680 --> 13:38.970
-Private may be on to something.

13:38.970 --> 13:40.120
Rico, what do you think?

13:49.970 --> 13:52.230
-That was my new calculator.

13:52.230 --> 13:53.380
Gone.

13:53.380 --> 13:54.840
Back to this, I guess.

13:54.840 --> 13:57.600
-Rico, destroy the
right device this time.

13:57.600 --> 14:00.410
Oh, maybe destroy them
all just to be sure.

14:00.410 --> 14:01.460
-OK.

14:01.460 --> 14:02.160
-Wait.

14:02.160 --> 14:03.610
There is no device to destroy.

14:03.610 --> 14:05.110
I haven't built it yet.

14:05.110 --> 14:09.310
It's just a plan--
a very big plan.

14:09.310 --> 14:10.480
-Oh, that's different.

14:10.480 --> 14:12.430
Plans aren't dangerous.

14:12.430 --> 14:13.990
-Oh, man.

14:13.990 --> 14:17.230
-Unless they fall
into the wrong hands.

14:18.790 --> 14:19.650

14:19.650 --> 14:23.230
I have wasted the best years
of my lonely, lonely life

14:23.230 --> 14:24.050
on these plans.

14:24.050 --> 14:26.770
I won't let you destroy them.

14:26.770 --> 14:29.140

-Black line right here.

14:48.150 --> 14:49.560
Another one right there.

14:52.720 --> 14:53.420
A squiggle there.

14:57.120 --> 15:00.030
-Kowalski, I don't
relish global armageddon.

15:00.030 --> 15:02.530
Except for the part with the
mutant vampire motorcycle gangs

15:02.530 --> 15:04.920
that rule the vast wastelands.

15:04.920 --> 15:08.430
Looking forward to throwing
down with those boys.

15:08.430 --> 15:09.220
-Skipper.

15:09.220 --> 15:11.380
-But, on the other hand,
I look at that scribble,

15:11.380 --> 15:13.740
and it's just so
much gobbledygook.

15:13.740 --> 15:15.990
-Life's work, Skipper.

15:15.990 --> 15:17.870
-Anyway, save it or shred it.

15:17.870 --> 15:18.980
You make the call.

15:18.980 --> 15:20.980
-Should I destroy
my greatest creation

15:20.980 --> 15:23.800
and deprive civilisation
of something wonderful,

15:23.800 --> 15:27.360

the luscious but familiar

15:35.080 --> 15:37.420

Or do I venture into

15:41.850 --> 15:42.620
-Oh, yes.

15:42.620 --> 15:44.160
It was as if time froze.

15:44.160 --> 15:47.130
Well, more like Kowalski
froze and time kept going.

15:47.130 --> 15:49.320
And going.

16:01.370 --> 16:03.580
with a penchant for painting.

16:03.580 --> 16:08.390
Arriving on the scene now is
famed art critic Bella Bon

Tell us, Bella, is Burt the

16:19.460 --> 16:22.230
-The panda was a hack.

16:22.230 --> 16:25.040
-Gentlemen, you are right.

16:25.040 --> 16:28.710
If these plans were to fall into
the wrong hands, civilisation

16:28.710 --> 16:30.670
itself would come to an end.

16:30.670 --> 16:35.290
Therefore, they
must be destroyed.

16:35.290 --> 16:37.650
-Good move, Kowalski.

16:37.650 --> 16:41.030
It's nice to see you
siding with civilisation.

16:41.030 --> 16:42.060
-Pursue those plans.

17:01.160 --> 17:03.990
-No, no, no.

17:03.990 --> 17:09.510
-This does not bode for the
abstract animal art movement.

17:09.510 --> 17:12.530
-Critics, what do they know?

17:20.610 --> 17:22.600
-What's this one?

17:22.600 --> 17:26.290
The elephant is going
in a bold new direction.

17:26.290 --> 17:27.580

17:27.580 --> 17:29.230
This must go straight
to the museum

17:29.230 --> 17:31.380

-But that wasn't even mine.

17:34.110 --> 17:35.390
-Oh, nuts!

17:35.390 --> 17:37.300
-This must go
straight to the museum

17:37.300 --> 17:39.950
for all the world to savour!

17:39.950 --> 17:42.010
-On the bright side,
Kowalski, your work

17:42.010 --> 17:44.260
is the buzz of the art scene.

17:44.260 --> 17:46.720
-Sure, the perfect
symmetry of my equation

17:46.720 --> 17:48.800
may look like a
harmless abstract.

17:48.800 --> 17:52.400
But any evil genius with a
Van Dyke will see the truth.

17:52.400 --> 17:53.930
Let me illustrate.

17:53.930 --> 17:57.080
I am an evil genius
visiting the museum.

-Hello there.

-I'm visiting the museum, too.

18:37.430 --> 18:38.300
-Really?

18:38.300 --> 18:39.600
You sure?

18:39.600 --> 18:40.610
-Yes.

18:40.610 --> 18:41.800

actually pretty good.

-Gosh, you really think so?

19:01.500 --> 19:02.590
-Yes.

-Absolutely.

-Yeah.
