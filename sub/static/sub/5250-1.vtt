00:00.968 --> 00:02.301
Excuse me, I have--

00:02.302 --> 00:03.971
...theater tickets, I'm seeing a matinee.

00:03.972 --> 00:05.171
Oh, Jesus!

00:05.172 --> 00:06.238
That's gonna be a great photo.

00:06.239 --> 00:07.572
Take a picture of a cab.

00:07.573 --> 00:09.140
Why don't you watch where you're going?

00:09.141 --> 00:11.343
Miss Redhead, could you take our picture?

00:11.344 --> 00:13.245
Do you know where I catch the M34A?

00:13.246 --> 00:14.279
No, I'm not touching that camera.

00:14.280 --> 00:15.480
I don't want swine flu.

00:15.481 --> 00:17.182
I don't know. Who takes the bus?

00:17.183 --> 00:19.386
Okay, but, please, can you tell us

00:19.387 --> 00:21.287
how can we get to 9/11?

00:21.288 --> 00:23.121
Hi, do you have a minute for gay rights?

00:23.122 --> 00:24.491
- Rashes.
- Gay rights?

00:24.492 --> 00:25.725
I've done plenty

00:25.726 --> 00:27.225
and took diminishing returns.

00:27.226 --> 00:28.760
Which way is the farmers' market?

00:28.761 --> 00:30.497
What more do you fucking want from me?

00:30.498 --> 00:31.797
- Oh!
- Idiot!

00:31.798 --> 00:33.600
My God, you're a grown man on a bike!

Hi. Are you ready for "Annie"?

00:40.072 --> 00:42.307
How dare you ask me
something so redundant.

00:42.308 --> 00:44.244
Just a second, I have
to finish this tweet.

00:44.245 --> 00:48.244
"'Til Blue Ivy is old enough to..."

00:49.583 --> 00:52.451
- Send.
- That's very funny.

00:52.452 --> 00:55.121
Thank you. I love "Annie."

00:55.122 --> 00:57.088
Isn't it funny how FDR is a total hero

00:57.089 --> 00:58.323
in this play even though in real life

00:58.324 --> 00:59.658
he let millions of Jews die?

00:59.659 --> 01:01.326
Hilarious. I love that we has born

01:01.327 --> 01:02.727
during a time when handicapped people

01:02.728 --> 01:05.096
still had to wear blankets on their laps.

01:05.096 --> 01:06.600
Have you heard from Josh?

01:06.601 --> 01:09.168
Nope, and it's been over a week

01:09.169 --> 01:10.237
and we are done.

01:10.238 --> 01:12.705
Oh, I'm so sorry, Billy.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.640
I'm actually very upset.

01:14.641 --> 01:16.476
- Josh was so hot.
- Yeah.

01:16.477 --> 01:17.643
And not a moron.

01:17.644 --> 01:19.010
Well, if he broke up with you,

01:19.011 --> 01:20.111
clearly he is a moron.

01:20.112 --> 01:21.214
By the way, your Real Housewives

01:21.215 --> 01:23.015
recap today was hilarious.

01:23.016 --> 01:24.449
- Oh, thank you.
- We were dying.

01:24.450 --> 01:25.550
God, I'm so funny when I write

01:25.551 --> 01:27.118
mean things about TV shows.

01:27.119 --> 01:28.486
How come no one's hired
me to write for one?

01:28.487 --> 01:29.688
Because our lives are garbage

01:29.689 --> 01:31.291
and it's the world's fault?

01:31.292 --> 01:32.491
(groans)

01:32.492 --> 01:34.694
I hate this time of year.

01:34.695 --> 01:36.229
My light spring jacket is soaked

01:36.230 --> 01:38.164
with both pollen and snow.

01:38.165 --> 01:39.698
I wish I never had to go outside.

01:39.699 --> 01:40.699
Well, that's why I've always been

01:40.700 --> 01:41.666
an indoors kid.

01:41.667 --> 01:43.234
I used to spend every recess

01:43.235 --> 01:44.469
in the school library,

01:44.470 --> 01:45.772
even when it was beautiful outside.

01:45.773 --> 01:47.306
That's adorable.

01:47.307 --> 01:48.540
I have such fond memories

01:48.541 --> 01:50.644
about the water fountain in that library.

01:50.645 --> 01:53.179
It had the most delicious water.

01:53.180 --> 01:55.146
That is so weird because my school library

01:55.147 --> 01:57.349
had an incredible water fountain also.

01:57.350 --> 01:58.719
You know what'd be smart?

01:58.720 --> 02:00.687
What if we went into--

02:03.056 --> 02:04.190
Oh God.

02:04.191 --> 02:05.726
What if we went into business

02:05.727 --> 02:09.161
selling bottled library
water fountain water?

02:09.162 --> 02:10.662
Okay, this is gonna sound insane,

02:10.663 --> 02:12.430
but I met somebody who sells water

02:12.431 --> 02:13.967
in milk cartons as an alternative

02:13.968 --> 02:15.201
to bottled water.

02:15.202 --> 02:16.601
It's like good for the environment.

02:16.602 --> 02:18.236
Doesn't the water inside taste like milk?

02:18.237 --> 02:20.007
- I don't think so.
- Seems like it would.

02:20.008 --> 02:21.407
(children giggling)

02:21.408 --> 02:23.110
God, I hate the sound
of children laughing.

02:23.111 --> 02:24.677
Oh shit!

02:24.678 --> 02:26.578
Annie is an understudy today

02:26.579 --> 02:28.480
and her name is Taylor. This generation!

02:28.481 --> 02:30.448
I swear to God, if she blows this role

02:30.449 --> 02:31.549
I will strap down my tits

02:31.550 --> 02:32.651
and get up on that stage.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.321
Excuse me, could you please

02:34.322 --> 02:36.355
watch your language?

02:36.356 --> 02:38.457
Oh my God, I am so so--

02:38.458 --> 02:39.457
- Miss, miss.
- Yes?

02:39.458 --> 02:40.692
- I am so sorry.
- It's okay.

02:40.693 --> 02:42.727
We can't do that at all.
Not gonna do that.

02:42.728 --> 02:44.195
I'm sorry, I think you can.

02:44.196 --> 02:46.264
- We're seeing "Annie."
- I paid $120,

02:46.265 --> 02:47.668
I can say "shit" if I want to.

02:47.669 --> 02:49.335
You-- hey!

02:49.336 --> 02:51.069
- Hey, hey.
- "Hey, hey."

02:51.070 --> 02:53.004
I would pay $120 for both of you

02:53.005 --> 02:54.239
to leave right now.

02:54.240 --> 02:55.407
This is a public place, and you know what?

02:55.408 --> 02:56.741
We're not seeing the real Annie.

02:56.742 --> 02:58.209
You're not seeing the real Annie today.

02:58.210 --> 02:59.444
Do not talk to my children.

02:59.445 --> 03:00.612
Do you know what an understudy is?

03:00.613 --> 03:02.447
You are terrifying my children.

03:02.448 --> 03:03.748
- Terrifying?
- You are terrifying.

03:03.749 --> 03:05.116
I told them a fact of life.

03:05.117 --> 03:06.351
You're a terrifying person.

03:06.352 --> 03:07.686
Nobody wants to see an understudy.

03:07.687 --> 03:09.254
- You don't know me.
- I do know you.

03:09.255 --> 03:11.289
An understudy, it's like a fancy word

03:11.290 --> 03:12.459
for disappointment.

03:14.000 --> 03:20.074

Hi, babies! Hi, angels.

03:27.174 --> 03:28.040
Hi, Noodles.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.341
Hello, Arthur.

03:29.342 --> 03:31.109
- What are you slicing?
- A quince.

03:31.110 --> 03:32.744
It's like an apple combined with a pear.

03:32.745 --> 03:34.345
Somebody at the office
wrote a book about them.

03:34.346 --> 03:36.047
Really? Somebody in public television

03:36.048 --> 03:37.751
wrote a book about something boring?

03:37.752 --> 03:39.051
Oh, you.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.351
Here, I made you a plate.

03:40.352 --> 03:42.087
Thank you, but you know
how I feel about fruit

03:42.088 --> 03:44.424
that's not in proximity to crust or cream.

03:44.425 --> 03:46.125
Oh.

03:46.126 --> 03:48.393
Hey, you know Gabby's
Oscar party this Sunday?

03:48.394 --> 03:49.761
I've been thinking about it

03:49.762 --> 03:51.696
and I think it'd be
better if I stayed home

03:51.697 --> 03:53.164
and live-tweeted the Oscars

03:53.165 --> 03:54.566
in my pajamas instead.

03:54.567 --> 03:56.636
Gabby's my boss, she's a big deal at PBS.

03:56.637 --> 03:58.170
Come on, Cara seed.

03:58.171 --> 03:59.606
I ask so little of you.

03:59.607 --> 04:02.641
I know, that's why we work.

04:02.642 --> 04:04.110
(phone buzzes)

04:04.111 --> 04:06.212
- Uh-oh.
- What?

04:06.213 --> 04:08.079
I tweeted something about Blue Ivy earlier

04:08.080 --> 04:10.450
and now the internet's
being really mean to me.

04:10.451 --> 04:12.251
"Unfollow, kill yourself."

04:12.252 --> 04:15.254
From SpinClassAddict91. Oh my God,

04:15.255 --> 04:16.757
that's probably the year she was born.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.324
What was the joke?

04:18.325 --> 04:19.991
"I can't wait for Blue
Ivy to be old enough

04:19.992 --> 04:21.628
for R. Kelly to piss on her."

04:21.629 --> 04:23.696
- Ah-ha.
- I hate this!

04:23.697 --> 04:25.130
I hate fighting with people.

04:25.131 --> 04:26.498
I just like saying something crazy

04:26.499 --> 04:28.166
and then leaving the room.

04:28.167 --> 04:29.567
Unless people like what I say

04:29.568 --> 04:30.971
and then I stay in the room.

04:30.972 --> 04:33.172
I know, I've met you before.

04:33.173 --> 04:35.408
I'm gonna delete this piss-baby tweet.

04:40.580 --> 04:43.182
I want the fries but I think I should

04:43.183 --> 04:45.551
just get the salad instead.

04:45.552 --> 04:48.020
I'll be good.

04:48.021 --> 04:49.188
Hello?

04:49.189 --> 04:50.288
How can you think about food?

04:50.289 --> 04:51.289
Huffington Post just tweeted about

04:51.290 --> 04:52.590
what George and Amal Clooney

04:52.591 --> 04:54.394
would look like as Simpsons characters.

04:54.395 --> 04:55.761
Come on.

04:55.762 --> 04:57.329
No.

04:57.330 --> 04:59.231
Hey Billy, you okay?

04:59.232 --> 05:00.466
I'm fine.

05:00.467 --> 05:01.733
I mean, you know, I'm in my mid thirties,

05:01.734 --> 05:03.668
I am waiting tables-- poorly--

05:03.669 --> 05:05.338
I spent the better part of last night

05:05.339 --> 05:07.006
Facebook stalking my ex,

05:07.007 --> 05:09.007
and according to NCI-
whatever the fuck it is,

05:09.008 --> 05:10.642
even Linda Hunt is more castable than me,

05:10.643 --> 05:12.245
so I'm doing great, thanks so much.

05:12.246 --> 05:14.547
Oh, thank you, sweet Matthew,

05:14.548 --> 05:17.081
for another morning full
of wonderful memories.

05:17.082 --> 05:18.383
Hey, where you guys been?

05:18.384 --> 05:19.350
Where have you been? I've been covering

05:19.351 --> 05:20.485
the whole place by myself.

05:20.486 --> 05:21.653
We had to get outfits

05:21.654 --> 05:23.657
for our mother/son photo shoot.

05:23.658 --> 05:26.458
Oh, sad, old Billy.

05:26.459 --> 05:28.094
He only ever gets to go shopping

05:28.095 --> 05:31.263
for antidepressants and Metamucil wafers.

05:31.264 --> 05:32.330
You know what, Matthew?

05:32.331 --> 05:33.364
Sometimes when I hear you speak,

05:33.365 --> 05:34.365
I think I should join

05:34.366 --> 05:35.700
the Westboro Baptist Church.

05:35.701 --> 05:36.968
Ever since I was told

05:36.969 --> 05:38.269
that I couldn't have children...

05:38.270 --> 05:40.371
- By yourself.
- ...because I hate them,

05:40.372 --> 05:42.073
I've only been sad about not having

05:42.074 --> 05:44.275
mother/son photos and matching outfits.

05:44.276 --> 05:45.743
Oh, that's when I told diva here

05:45.744 --> 05:47.347
that we may not be blood,

05:47.348 --> 05:49.481
but we are family.

05:49.482 --> 05:52.017
Oh, sing, bird, sing!

05:52.018 --> 05:53.152
You go, girl!

05:53.153 --> 05:54.688
Uh, uh, uh, uh, it is Denise.

05:54.689 --> 05:57.089
No, baby, go easy on Billy today.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.356
Josh just broke up with him.

05:58.357 --> 05:59.724
That's the guy that's cute and sweet

05:59.725 --> 06:01.259
in a Paul Rudd-ish way.

06:01.260 --> 06:02.727
- And that's rare.
- We all got problems,

06:02.728 --> 06:04.264
get your ass back to work.

06:04.265 --> 06:06.365
And you, I got a gift for you.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.767
- Oh yeah?
- Mm-hm.

06:08.768 --> 06:11.503
I'm sorry, does anybody work here?

06:11.504 --> 06:13.004
Oh yeah, I'll be back to help you

06:13.005 --> 06:14.574
and the rest of the Traveling Wilburys

06:14.575 --> 06:16.142
in a second.

06:21.982 --> 06:24.083
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi!

06:24.084 --> 06:27.119
Don't you look pretty when you smile?

06:27.120 --> 06:29.355
Aww!

06:29.356 --> 06:31.456
Honey, do you know this Lena Dunham?

06:31.457 --> 06:32.523
Yeah, actually, um...

06:32.524 --> 06:34.158
Apparently she's doing great;

06:34.159 --> 06:35.495
she's younger than you.

06:35.496 --> 06:36.662
She has tattoos.

06:36.663 --> 06:38.029
Anyway, this article says

06:38.030 --> 06:39.332
it is a great time now

06:39.333 --> 06:41.433
for women in comedy.

06:41.434 --> 06:43.301
That's very helpful. Thanks, Mom.

06:43.302 --> 06:45.238
So, aren't you gonna ask me if I finished

06:45.239 --> 06:47.206
my hypnosis course?

06:47.207 --> 06:49.507
Wow, that would have been a breakneck pace

06:49.508 --> 06:50.675
for a change of subjects

06:50.676 --> 06:52.145
if both subjects weren't you.

06:52.146 --> 06:54.346
I finished my hypnosis course.

06:54.347 --> 06:56.047
When can I practice on you?

06:56.048 --> 06:57.382
You're not hypnotizing me.

06:57.383 --> 06:59.050
It's not like I tell you you're a chicken

06:59.051 --> 07:00.487
and then you act like a chicken.

07:00.488 --> 07:02.221
That very well may be,

07:02.222 --> 07:03.621
but I still don't want you to do it.

07:03.622 --> 07:05.091
You're lucky to have a mom

07:05.092 --> 07:06.425
who's a shrink.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.028
Yes, I'm a walking gratitude list.

07:08.029 --> 07:09.061
Yeah.

07:09.062 --> 07:10.161
I asked for sparkling.

07:10.162 --> 07:11.629
- How's Billy?
- He's good.

07:11.630 --> 07:13.231
You know, he is just getting over

07:13.232 --> 07:14.432
this guy is the only thing.

07:14.433 --> 07:15.535
Josh. I don't know if you met him.

07:15.536 --> 07:17.736
- I can hypnotize him.
- Hm.

07:17.737 --> 07:19.370
It's not like I tell him he's a chicken

07:19.371 --> 07:21.308
then all of a sudden he becomes a chicken

07:21.309 --> 07:22.775
or something.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.609
Did you get that article I sent you

07:24.610 --> 07:26.446
about Palestine because I'm about

07:26.447 --> 07:28.180
to resend it.

07:28.181 --> 07:29.715
There we are.

07:29.716 --> 07:31.217
What else?

07:36.723 --> 07:38.091
What's more of a turn-off,

07:38.092 --> 07:40.159
veganism or Judaica?

07:40.160 --> 07:41.227
Oh, I don't know.

07:41.228 --> 07:42.161
Judaica.

07:42.162 --> 07:43.395
Yes! Yes.

07:43.396 --> 07:44.696
If I was going out with a guy

07:44.697 --> 07:46.230
and there was a big clay mezuzah

07:46.231 --> 07:47.765
hanging outside his place, I'd be like,

07:47.766 --> 07:50.368
"Is a circumcised experience worth it?"

07:50.369 --> 07:51.669
Is that anti-Semitic of us

07:51.670 --> 07:53.638
or is that not possible
because we're Jewish?

07:53.639 --> 07:55.273
- Oh, it's possible.
- Oh, that's right,

07:55.274 --> 07:56.541
'cause you hate other gay guys.

07:56.542 --> 07:58.111
No, I do not hate other gay people--

07:58.112 --> 07:59.478
yes, I do.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.314
I get very homophobic when I go to my gym.

08:01.315 --> 08:02.748
These are delicious.

08:02.749 --> 08:04.249
- Hi.
- Hello!

08:04.250 --> 08:05.283
Nice to see you again.

08:05.284 --> 08:06.417
Nice to see you. Remind me.

08:06.418 --> 08:08.152
Uh, the UCB party last week.

08:08.153 --> 08:09.089
- Right, yeah.
- The party.

08:09.090 --> 08:12.057
- I'm Julie.
- Hi.

08:12.058 --> 08:15.561
So, you two are in comedy.

08:15.562 --> 08:17.296
Yes! Unfortunately, yes.

08:17.297 --> 08:19.298
Nice, nice.

08:19.299 --> 08:20.767
Do you like Daniel Tosh?

08:20.768 --> 08:24.169
(phones ringing)

08:24.170 --> 08:25.737
You know the water business, right?

08:25.738 --> 08:27.974
We admittedly don't know
anything about that,

08:27.975 --> 08:30.442
but we have an amazing idea.

08:30.443 --> 08:32.043
It occurred to Billy recently--

08:32.044 --> 08:33.544
Well, it occurred to Julie.

08:33.544 --> 08:35.246
Well, it occurred to both
of us at the same time--

08:35.246 --> 08:36.481
- It occurred to Julie.
- When this goes,

08:36.482 --> 08:37.715
we'll figure out the credit later.

08:37.716 --> 08:39.052
We're not people who argue about credits.

08:39.053 --> 08:41.253
It occurred to us that water

08:41.254 --> 08:42.587
from library water fountains

08:42.587 --> 08:44.022
is by far the coldest,

08:44.023 --> 08:45.625
most delicious water in the world.

08:45.626 --> 08:49.195
So, why not bottle it?

08:50.663 --> 08:52.465
Well, we don't bottle here.

08:52.466 --> 08:54.199
We're boxed water.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.566
Have you seen our cartons?

08:55.567 --> 08:57.502
They're really cool,
they're biodegradable.

08:57.503 --> 08:59.504
Doesn't the water inside
of those taste like milk?

08:59.505 --> 09:00.738
- No.
- Not even a little bit?

09:00.739 --> 09:02.006
Not even a little bit.

09:02.007 --> 09:02.742
It seems like it would.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.309
They're new containers,

09:04.310 --> 09:06.177
they're not made from recycled milk boxes.

09:06.178 --> 09:07.412
Still seems like the water inside

09:07.413 --> 09:09.249
would taste a little milky.

09:10.617 --> 09:13.419
Well, did you want me to sample your...

09:13.420 --> 09:14.721
What's it called again?

09:14.722 --> 09:17.056
Library water fountain water.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.758
We don't have any with us.

09:20.427 --> 09:21.460
Okay.

09:21.461 --> 09:23.061
Listen, this is a great idea.

09:23.062 --> 09:24.495
Just tap into your memories of being

09:24.496 --> 09:25.732
a little kid at the library,

09:25.733 --> 09:27.199
surrounded by books.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.399
Do you know what we're talking about?

09:28.400 --> 09:29.667
That library water fountain water,

09:29.668 --> 09:31.369
it's so crisp and cold and delicious

09:31.370 --> 09:33.037
from when you were a kid?

09:33.038 --> 09:34.472
Do you know what I mean?

09:34.473 --> 09:36.707
People don't even remember
that they love that

09:36.708 --> 09:38.609
but if they just had it in a bottle--

09:38.610 --> 09:40.678
I mean, this, no one wants to carry this--

09:40.679 --> 09:43.416
if they just had it in a
nice, you know, bottle,

09:43.417 --> 09:46.151
a plastic bottle, a glass bottle.

09:46.152 --> 09:47.485
He doesn't seem like a book person.

09:47.486 --> 09:48.621
No, you seem more like a kickball

09:48.622 --> 09:49.688
at recess type.

09:49.689 --> 09:50.755
Maybe that's what it is.

09:50.756 --> 09:52.156
He wasn't in the library,

09:52.157 --> 09:53.424
that's the problem.

09:53.425 --> 09:54.659
- Oh! That's what it is.
- He doesn't get it.

09:54.660 --> 09:56.763
Because he was the first guy picked

09:56.764 --> 09:57.763
for kickball.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.063
Exactly. We didn't--

09:59.064 --> 10:00.331
We didn't ever get picked.

10:00.332 --> 10:01.566
We're not athletic people.

10:01.567 --> 10:02.967
We're not, you know--

10:02.968 --> 10:04.068
We're not Chelsea Clinton.

10:04.069 --> 10:05.105
- Yeah.
- You know?

10:05.106 --> 10:07.406
We're barely Chelsea Handler.

10:07.407 --> 10:08.608
You must love her.

10:08.609 --> 10:11.443
"Oh, oh, she's so bad."

10:11.444 --> 10:13.377
- "Oh, oh!"
- "Oh, she's so naughty!"

10:13.378 --> 10:14.512
"No, no, she says what I think!"

10:14.513 --> 10:16.147
"I got drunk last night."

10:16.148 --> 10:17.615
- "I'm so drunk."
- "Oh, my bachelorette party!"

10:17.616 --> 10:19.083
"I've been so drunk for
the last five years,

10:19.084 --> 10:20.453
I haven't written a joke!"

10:20.454 --> 10:22.488
(laughing)

10:22.489 --> 10:26.091
Yeah, I don't know how I can help you two.

10:26.092 --> 10:28.093
Put it in a bottle.

10:28.094 --> 10:29.093
We don't bottle here.

10:29.094 --> 10:30.328
Right, but you can,

10:30.329 --> 10:31.231
that's the whole thing.

10:31.232 --> 10:33.433
You know water, right?

10:34.434 --> 10:36.401
Are those your kids?

10:36.402 --> 10:40.639
Yes. That's Memphis and that's Maverick.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.374
What?

10:42.375 --> 10:43.610
The girl's name is Memphis

10:43.611 --> 10:46.645
and the boy's name is Maverick.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.314
What?

10:49.315 --> 10:50.483
The girl's name is Memphis

10:50.484 --> 10:53.519
and the boy's name is Maverick.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.288
- We have to go.
- We have to go.

11:03.530 --> 11:04.497
What are you recapping?

11:04.498 --> 11:06.598
Oh, "Vanderpump Rules."

11:06.599 --> 11:08.065
God, if these idiots were the characters

11:08.066 --> 11:09.300
in "Angels in America,"

11:09.301 --> 11:10.368
nobody would have cared

11:10.369 --> 11:11.602
when any of them dropped dead.

11:11.603 --> 11:13.271
Yeah, well, that's why Tony Kushner

11:13.272 --> 11:14.274
went in a different direction.

11:14.275 --> 11:15.607
No, no, no, no, no.

11:15.608 --> 11:17.610
You gotta get Julie up out of here, man.

11:17.611 --> 11:20.078
No, Nate, I need Julie here today.

11:20.079 --> 11:21.379
Josh just broke up with me and I need

11:21.380 --> 11:22.980
her here in case I have a feeling.

11:22.981 --> 11:24.448
Yeah, I'm basically like
his service rabbit.

11:24.449 --> 11:25.683
Oh, you know what we should do?

11:25.684 --> 11:27.652
We should get me a vest that says,

11:27.653 --> 11:29.253
"Emotional support animal.

11:29.254 --> 11:30.790
Do not touch or talk to.

11:30.791 --> 11:32.257
Please feed."

11:32.258 --> 11:33.457
Oh my God, I have to stop

11:33.458 --> 11:35.092
following Deadline on Twitter.

11:35.093 --> 11:36.661
- Why, what happened?
- Do you remember that girl

11:36.662 --> 11:38.763
Stephanie Goldstein from our improv class?

11:38.764 --> 11:41.098
Oh, the one that never
heard of Monty Python?

11:41.099 --> 11:42.735
Yeah. She just signed with CAA.

11:42.736 --> 11:43.769
Oh, shut up.

11:43.770 --> 11:45.136
It was just announced.

11:45.137 --> 11:46.370
When's it gonna be our turn?

11:46.371 --> 11:48.439
Everybody we came up with in comedy

11:48.440 --> 11:50.274
has either quit to start a family

11:50.275 --> 11:51.709
or gone on to great success

11:51.710 --> 11:53.144
in film and television.

11:53.145 --> 11:54.579
I know, and I'm sitting here,

11:54.580 --> 11:56.380
checking Twitter for faves and retweets

11:56.381 --> 11:58.115
and just keep pressing and "Who faved me?

11:58.116 --> 12:00.017
Who faved me? Oh, Andy Richter faved me.

12:00.018 --> 12:01.552
Oh, this is the best day ever."

12:01.553 --> 12:03.054
Like I'm fucking pressing

12:03.055 --> 12:05.089
for some pain medication in a hospital.

12:05.090 --> 12:06.591
And I'm looking for reassurance,

12:06.592 --> 12:08.492
that I should have probably
gotten from my mother,

12:08.493 --> 12:10.428
from internet commenters who say,

12:10.429 --> 12:11.629
"Great recap, Julie!"

12:11.630 --> 12:13.533
and, "Boy, that sure was good,"

12:13.534 --> 12:17.169
even though deep down I know that...

12:17.170 --> 12:18.469
I'll never be enough.

12:18.470 --> 12:20.404
Excuse me? Um, I hate to interrupt,

12:20.405 --> 12:22.206
I can tell, clearly, you're going through

12:22.207 --> 12:23.476
a lot here, but, um,

12:23.477 --> 12:25.110
could I get this to go?

12:25.111 --> 12:27.180
I'm late for chemo.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.617
Our photo shoot was on fleek.

12:31.618 --> 12:32.652
You were flawless.

12:32.653 --> 12:34.152
No, you were flawless.

12:34.153 --> 12:36.588
Oh, we both were gorgeous.

12:36.589 --> 12:37.557
(gasps dramatically)

12:37.558 --> 12:39.091
Billy, get rid of her.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.224
I just bought a lottery ticket

12:40.225 --> 12:41.525
and I can't have some

12:41.526 --> 12:43.094
copper-topped curse hanging around.

12:43.095 --> 12:44.528
Denise, you have a business degree

12:44.529 --> 12:46.230
from Holy Cross, please stop pretending

12:46.231 --> 12:47.665
that you're an unreasonable person.

12:47.666 --> 12:49.168
Redheads are not bad luck.

12:49.169 --> 12:50.469
Mm-hm.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.505
Well, I know one person
who's clearly jinxed.

12:52.506 --> 12:53.772
Billy!

12:53.773 --> 12:55.774
Matthew, that's enough.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.308
Sorry that NAMBLA doesn't have

12:57.309 --> 12:58.442
a "Ones to Watch" section

12:58.443 --> 12:59.744
in their monthly newsletter

12:59.745 --> 13:02.115
that you could use as a press clipping.

13:04.217 --> 13:05.549
Oh, I forgot to mention.

13:05.550 --> 13:07.687
Um, when Denise and I
were walking over here,

13:07.688 --> 13:09.221
we saw Josh.

13:09.222 --> 13:10.454
He was holding hands with another guy

13:10.455 --> 13:12.492
and they were smiling really big.

13:16.696 --> 13:19.232
Do you want to take a
walk around the block?

13:19.233 --> 13:22.634
We can talk about Susan Sarandon.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.304
Beats taking deep breaths.

13:24.305 --> 13:26.438
Okay, ping-pong. Why?

13:26.439 --> 13:28.506
Well, does she still
have the ping-pong bar?

13:28.507 --> 13:31.309
As far as I know it's
not a pizza place yet.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.010
- She can do anything.
- Geena Davis.

13:33.011 --> 13:33.746
Do you think they're friends?

13:33.747 --> 13:35.214
I think they email.

13:45.124 --> 13:46.190
So why don't you tell me why

13:46.191 --> 13:47.260
you're here today, Billy.

13:47.261 --> 13:49.127
I'd like to eat less pasta.

13:49.128 --> 13:50.328
I thought there was a boy.

13:50.329 --> 13:51.562
Yeah, there's a boy too.

13:51.563 --> 13:53.064
His name is Josh, I'm trying to get over,

13:53.065 --> 13:54.365
but honestly, if you could just

13:54.366 --> 13:56.200
hypnotize me to stop eating pasta

13:56.201 --> 13:57.968
all the goddamn time, I'd be thrilled.

13:57.969 --> 13:59.403
Oh, I'm not eating sugar right now.

13:59.404 --> 14:01.040
It takes a lot of resolve.

14:01.041 --> 14:02.407
- Okay.
- Yeah.

14:02.408 --> 14:03.507
Anyway, we could talk all day,

14:03.508 --> 14:04.575
but why don't you lie down

14:04.576 --> 14:06.079
and we'll get you hypnotized.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.280
Okay.

14:09.115 --> 14:11.250
Okay, get yourself settled, good.

14:11.251 --> 14:14.086
Now, what I want you to do now, Billy,

14:14.087 --> 14:15.721
is close your eyes

14:15.722 --> 14:18.191
and take some deep breaths.

14:21.761 --> 14:24.229
How's this thing work?

14:24.230 --> 14:27.399
Wait a minute, we gotta turn it on.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.400
What? Okay, now I'm watching a video.

14:29.401 --> 14:31.704
Do you need me to do something or...?

14:31.705 --> 14:33.605
Oh, there it goes. Okay.

14:33.606 --> 14:36.108
(ocean sound effects)

14:36.109 --> 14:37.174
Now, what I want you to do

14:37.175 --> 14:38.711
is picture a staircase.

14:38.712 --> 14:41.513
You're at the bottom of the staircase now

14:41.514 --> 14:43.216
and when you reach the top,

14:43.217 --> 14:45.083
you'll be hypnotized.

14:45.084 --> 14:47.018
I have a very breathy voice

14:47.019 --> 14:48.454
and I'm very good at this,

14:48.455 --> 14:51.022
so just let go.

14:51.023 --> 14:53.158
This is your time.

14:53.159 --> 14:55.694
This is all about you.

14:55.695 --> 14:58.764
Think about the shoes you're wearing.

14:58.765 --> 15:01.566
How do they feel?

15:01.567 --> 15:03.702
I usually wear Aerosoles.

15:03.703 --> 15:05.203
I also like Merrells.

15:05.204 --> 15:08.240
Zappos.com is terrific.

15:08.241 --> 15:09.609
Are you still hypnotizing me?

15:09.610 --> 15:10.709
Yes.

15:10.710 --> 15:13.345
Take another deep breath.

15:13.346 --> 15:15.281
Ah, you're on the fourth step now.

15:15.282 --> 15:18.116
Your hands and your legs are heavy.

15:18.117 --> 15:19.718
Congratulations,

15:19.719 --> 15:22.521
you are hypnotized.

15:22.522 --> 15:24.122
Okay.

15:24.123 --> 15:25.725
Billy, seriously, you have got to

15:25.726 --> 15:28.059
knock it off with the pasta.

15:28.060 --> 15:29.194
All right.

15:29.195 --> 15:30.596
Okay, and what's this guy's name?

15:30.597 --> 15:32.197
- Josh.
- From now on,

15:32.198 --> 15:34.100
you're not gonna think about him anymore.

15:34.101 --> 15:34.966
Got it.

15:34.967 --> 15:36.301
Okay, good.

15:36.302 --> 15:38.537
Now, I'd like to take the time

15:38.538 --> 15:40.572
to bonus hypnotize you

15:40.573 --> 15:41.705
to call a car service

15:41.706 --> 15:43.073
if you ever find yourself

15:43.074 --> 15:44.477
in a deserted neighborhood.

15:44.478 --> 15:47.312
I do not like to think of you and Julie

15:47.313 --> 15:48.581
wandering around Brooklyn

15:48.582 --> 15:50.382
or wherever at night.

15:50.383 --> 15:52.717
- Okay.
- I mean, can you imagine

15:52.718 --> 15:54.218
being in a strange neighborhood

15:54.219 --> 15:55.519
and having to find a restaurant

15:55.520 --> 15:56.789
so you could ask them if you could use

15:56.790 --> 15:58.223
their bathroom?

15:58.224 --> 15:59.623
And then you'd have to order,

15:59.624 --> 16:01.427
I don't know, plantains or something,

16:01.428 --> 16:03.028
before they'd let you.

16:03.029 --> 16:05.563
And what if you didn't
have your cell phone?

16:05.564 --> 16:07.300
Why wouldn't I have my cell phone?

16:07.301 --> 16:09.434
Because teenagers steal them.

16:09.435 --> 16:10.968
This is a trend, I read about it

16:10.969 --> 16:12.303
in the Wall Street Journal.

16:12.304 --> 16:13.706
- You did?
- Yeah, they've got

16:13.707 --> 16:15.140
local stories too,

16:15.141 --> 16:17.209
and great articles on TV.

16:17.210 --> 16:18.211
Apparently, it's a big time

16:18.212 --> 16:19.644
for women in comedy.

16:19.645 --> 16:22.113
Yeah, no, I love women in comedy.

16:22.114 --> 16:23.381
Billy?

16:23.382 --> 16:25.217
Does Julie have a shot?

16:25.218 --> 16:26.318
I think so.

16:26.319 --> 16:27.620
I think she's funny,

16:27.621 --> 16:30.056
but none of my friends do.

16:32.291 --> 16:34.125
- Hi!
- Gabby!

16:34.126 --> 16:36.028
Don't those shoes look comfortable.

16:36.029 --> 16:38.096
Thank you. Come on in.

16:38.097 --> 16:41.166
Guys, this is Julie and Arthur.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.235
Do you guys like seaweed

16:42.236 --> 16:43.435
or coconut water?

16:43.436 --> 16:44.602
We're not serving either,

16:44.603 --> 16:45.703
we were just talking about food

16:45.704 --> 16:47.171
right before you got here.

16:47.172 --> 16:48.641
Everybody, please look down,

16:48.642 --> 16:50.408
I lost my earring.

16:50.409 --> 16:52.677
It's made entirely of hemp.

16:52.678 --> 16:54.479
I'm at a terrible party.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.447
Hi, I'm Billy, Julie invited me

16:56.448 --> 16:57.216
to your home.

16:57.217 --> 16:58.149
Oh.

16:58.150 --> 16:59.518
- Hi.
- Hi, Billy.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.552
- Oh, thank God.
- Hi, so Mira Sorvino--

17:01.553 --> 17:02.686
So, I was just telling Gabby

17:02.687 --> 17:04.355
how you and Billy might be

17:04.356 --> 17:06.156
on your phones all night,
tweeting the Oscars

17:06.156 --> 17:07.492
so she shouldn't get offended.

17:07.493 --> 17:09.227
I don't get Twitter.

17:09.228 --> 17:10.596
Why would I want to let everyone know

17:10.597 --> 17:13.098
what I had for lunch today?

17:13.098 --> 17:14.498
But wait, can you delete a tweet

17:14.499 --> 17:16.400
or a twit or whatever if you want to?

17:16.401 --> 17:18.167
Yeah, um, just the other day

17:18.169 --> 17:19.672
I tweeted something about Blue Ivy

17:19.673 --> 17:21.039
that I took down.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.741
Blue Ivy, she is so cute.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.544
Oh, uh, Julie, this is Kathy.

17:24.545 --> 17:26.511
Hi. Don't I know you?

17:26.512 --> 17:28.280
I don't think so, but...

17:28.281 --> 17:29.713
I think we have the same iPhone case.

17:29.714 --> 17:30.983
Do you like Taylor Swift?

17:30.984 --> 17:33.151
Oh God, no, no. This is ironic.

17:33.152 --> 17:34.652
I actually bought it
with Diet Coke coupons

17:34.653 --> 17:36.355
after my last phone fell into a touch tank

17:36.356 --> 17:38.390
at the Coney Island Aquarium.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.292
Long story.

17:40.293 --> 17:43.628
So, uh, what did you say about Blue Ivy?

17:43.629 --> 17:46.064
I swear I feel like we've met.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.099
I said something like, um,

17:48.100 --> 17:49.268
"I can't wait for Blue Ivy

17:49.269 --> 17:50.635
to be old enough..."

17:50.636 --> 17:52.638
Gosh, she's already so big, right?

17:52.639 --> 17:55.507
Somebody mute the commercials!

17:55.508 --> 17:57.410
"I can't wait for Blue Ivy to be

17:57.411 --> 18:00.378
old enough for R. Kelly to piss on her."

18:00.379 --> 18:01.480
Because you know R. Kelly likes

18:01.481 --> 18:03.014
pissing on children.

18:03.015 --> 18:04.517
Who are older than infants, allegedly,

18:04.518 --> 18:06.551
but, you know, not by much.

18:06.552 --> 18:08.321
I mean, he's basically a sex offender.

18:08.322 --> 18:10.388
And depending on, you know,

18:10.389 --> 18:13.058
whether the charges are true,

18:13.059 --> 18:15.026
allegedly a pedophile.

18:15.027 --> 18:17.029
Allegedly.

18:19.231 --> 18:20.299
Mm.

18:23.636 --> 18:27.339
Yeah, I remember who you are now.

18:27.340 --> 18:28.541
You sat behind me at "Annie"

18:28.542 --> 18:30.008
with your gay friend.

18:30.009 --> 18:31.375
There was a small earthquake in LA,

18:31.376 --> 18:32.545
but don't worry, Emmy Rossum is fine.

18:32.546 --> 18:34.546
- Oh, thank God.
- Oh, yeah,

18:34.547 --> 18:36.215
I remember the both of you.

18:36.216 --> 18:37.782
Oh, hi!

18:37.783 --> 18:41.052
Hi! You're both disgusting people.

18:41.053 --> 18:42.586
And you, you think it's funny

18:42.587 --> 18:45.122
to make jokes about urinating on children?

18:45.123 --> 18:47.291
Obviously I don't because
I took down the tweet.

18:47.292 --> 18:48.292
You only took it down

18:48.293 --> 18:49.395
because you got in trouble.

18:49.396 --> 18:50.662
Of course I did.

18:50.663 --> 18:52.262
If people loved it, I
would have left it up.

18:52.263 --> 18:53.530
Noodles, come on, the show's back on.

18:53.531 --> 18:55.265
Let's watch TV and, uh, pretend

18:55.266 --> 18:56.533
what just happened didn't happen.

18:56.534 --> 18:58.068
You know, we may be missing a crucial

18:58.069 --> 18:59.470
red carpet moment with Giuliana Rancic.

18:59.471 --> 19:01.372
What if she interacts with Maria Menounos?

19:01.373 --> 19:02.606
- Could you imagine?
- I'd kill myself.

19:02.607 --> 19:04.074
Well, the two of their matchstick bodies

19:04.075 --> 19:05.342
would probably create a giant fire,

19:05.343 --> 19:06.644
you could just throw
yourself right into it.

19:06.645 --> 19:08.047
You know, that's how Gene Siskel died.

19:08.048 --> 19:10.215
Julie, Billy, please,

19:10.216 --> 19:11.683
this is a work party,

19:11.684 --> 19:13.017
I need you two to be more polite

19:13.018 --> 19:14.051
to non-each other people.

19:14.052 --> 19:15.085
Okay, just for tonight.

19:15.086 --> 19:16.188
I'm so sorry, Arthur.

19:16.189 --> 19:18.456
We will keep a low profile.

19:18.457 --> 19:20.592
Billy!

19:20.593 --> 19:22.527
We brought hummus and MDMA!

19:22.528 --> 19:23.794
I'm so sorry, I invited some people over

19:23.795 --> 19:25.162
without your permission.

19:25.163 --> 19:26.332
Hi, come in, come in, come in.

19:26.333 --> 19:27.767
Hey guys!

19:29.535 --> 19:30.969
Oh no.

19:30.970 --> 19:32.102
Kevin, do you know her?

19:32.103 --> 19:33.671
Yes, we met the other day.

19:33.672 --> 19:35.439
She came in to pitch me library water.

19:35.440 --> 19:36.974
Would you keep your voice down?

19:36.975 --> 19:38.475
No one's gonna steal that idea.

19:38.476 --> 19:40.678
Wait, why are you two holding hands?

19:40.679 --> 19:42.079
We're married, idiot.

19:42.080 --> 19:43.080
Remember, I showed you

19:43.081 --> 19:44.281
a photo of our kids.

19:44.282 --> 19:45.582
Mentos and Marlboro!

19:45.583 --> 19:48.087
- Memphis and Maverick!
- How are they?

19:48.088 --> 19:51.790
Billy, we invited some more people over!

19:51.791 --> 19:53.625
Hi, I'm Josh.

19:53.626 --> 19:54.760
Hi.

19:56.429 --> 19:57.529
Hey Josh.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.431
Hey! How are you?

19:59.432 --> 20:00.765
I'm-I'm great.

20:00.766 --> 20:02.735
- Good, good.
- Can I take your coat?

20:02.736 --> 20:04.235
Yeah, sure.

20:04.236 --> 20:05.504
Sorry, I never know what to wear

20:05.505 --> 20:07.005
in this weather.

20:07.006 --> 20:08.572
Yeah, I know, it's like
it's cold and it's hot

20:08.573 --> 20:10.007
and it's cold and it's hot

20:10.008 --> 20:11.141
and I put on my light spring jacket

20:11.142 --> 20:12.142
and it ends up getting soaked

20:12.143 --> 20:13.444
with pollen and snow and...

20:13.445 --> 20:15.479
- Is that a yarmulke?
- Yeah.

20:15.480 --> 20:17.416
You know, I started going to shul more.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.418
No, no. Goodbye.

20:23.389 --> 20:24.521
Where are we even?

20:24.522 --> 20:25.624
It's been forever.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.192
I really have to pee.

20:27.193 --> 20:28.194
Train's only a block away,

20:28.195 --> 20:29.694
or it should be.

20:29.695 --> 20:30.629
So you're telling me you're completely

20:30.630 --> 20:32.030
over Josh, just now?

20:32.031 --> 20:33.331
Yup.

20:33.332 --> 20:34.665
I have no feelings for him whatsoever.

20:34.666 --> 20:35.766
And you don't think
that has anything to do

20:35.767 --> 20:37.103
with my mom hypnotizing you?

20:37.104 --> 20:38.470
No. You saw him.

20:38.471 --> 20:39.503
He's the type of Jewish guy that

20:39.504 --> 20:41.004
wears a yarmulke all the time.

20:41.005 --> 20:42.039
What about pasta?

20:42.040 --> 20:43.173
Oh, I'd stick my dick

20:43.174 --> 20:44.374
in a bowl of pasta right now.

20:44.375 --> 20:45.711
Okay, this is where the train's

20:45.712 --> 20:48.046
supposed to be. Ghost train.

20:48.047 --> 20:49.346
Look, we are never going
to find this subway,

20:49.347 --> 20:51.016
so can we please just get a car?

20:51.017 --> 20:53.419
I'll get an Uber.

20:56.388 --> 20:58.656
Oh no. Look.

20:58.657 --> 21:00.592
This isn't my phone.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.128
That garbage person Kathy

21:02.129 --> 21:03.995
must have taken mine.

21:03.996 --> 21:05.262
Arthur, could you call a car?

21:05.263 --> 21:07.231
I really have to go to the bathroom.

21:07.232 --> 21:08.332
Well, I'm sure she'll give

21:08.333 --> 21:09.299
yours back when she realizes.

21:09.300 --> 21:10.567
She's not a total monster.

21:10.568 --> 21:12.169
It says the driver's 18 minutes away.

21:12.170 --> 21:14.104
Oh, I can't hold it for that long.

21:14.105 --> 21:15.541
Julie, you are not going to piss yourself

21:15.542 --> 21:16.641
on this street.

21:16.642 --> 21:18.242
Now it says he's 23 minutes away.

21:18.243 --> 21:19.710
No, no, no, no, no, no.

21:19.711 --> 21:21.011
I'll read you some Oscar tweets

21:21.012 --> 21:22.613
to distract you. Ready? Listen.

21:22.614 --> 21:24.014
Here's one from Gabe.

21:24.015 --> 21:25.684
He said, "This is a big comeback

21:25.685 --> 21:27.152
for Natalie Portman,

21:27.153 --> 21:28.687
who was unemployed for almost 9 years

21:28.688 --> 21:30.121
before turning 9."

21:30.122 --> 21:32.356
- That's funny.
- Driver unavailable.

21:32.357 --> 21:33.692
I'll read you some more.

21:33.693 --> 21:35.994
Here's one from...

21:35.995 --> 21:37.663
Wait, here's one from you.

21:37.664 --> 21:38.696
What?

21:38.697 --> 21:40.465
From like a half hour ago.

21:40.466 --> 21:42.267
How is that possible?

21:42.268 --> 21:45.603
Holy shit.

21:45.604 --> 21:48.573
"I'm a jerk who hates kids with cool names

21:48.574 --> 21:50.609
and thinks it's funny when children

21:50.610 --> 21:52.744
get pissed on, when in fact,

21:52.745 --> 21:55.414
I deserve to get pissed on."

21:57.249 --> 21:59.251
(urinating)

22:02.188 --> 22:03.622
Touché, Kathy.

22:05.424 --> 22:06.625
Touché.
