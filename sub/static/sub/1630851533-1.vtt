WEBVTT

01:58.044 --> 01:59.577
<i>They followed me home.</i>

04:53.652 --> 04:55.087
What are you doing?

04:55.154 --> 04:56.154
Nothing.

04:58.390 --> 04:59.458
Liar.

05:02.995 --> 05:04.430
Come on, let's go.

06:19.938 --> 06:22.274
I got it especially for you.

06:55.974 --> 06:57.209
Are we ready?

07:01.747 --> 07:03.282
Detective O'Mally

07:03.349 --> 07:04.659
with the deerfield police
department

07:04.683 --> 07:05.684
second precinct.

07:05.751 --> 07:06.752
This is Mr. Farber

07:06.819 --> 07:08.520
from child protective services.

07:08.587 --> 07:09.731
<i>Sir, can you please
state your name</i>

07:09.755 --> 07:10.789
<i>for the record?</i>

07:10.855 --> 07:12.291
<i>Francis stark.</i>

07:12.358 --> 07:13.559
Mr. Stark, can you tell us

07:13.625 --> 07:14.993
where you were last night?

07:15.060 --> 07:16.304
Uh, last night
was Christmas, right?

07:16.328 --> 07:18.163
It was Christmas, sir.

07:18.230 --> 07:20.070
Were you with your son, Herman,
and his family?

07:20.099 --> 07:21.600
<i>No. Ever since my wife died,</i>

07:21.667 --> 07:23.969
<i>I just stay right here,
just me and calli.</i>

07:24.036 --> 07:25.070
I'm sorry, who?

07:25.137 --> 07:26.672
Calli, my cat.

07:26.739 --> 07:28.207
She's scared of people

07:28.273 --> 07:30.576
- so she's probably in her house.
- Okay.

07:32.277 --> 07:34.747
<i>Sir, did anything unusual
happen last night?</i>

07:34.813 --> 07:36.382
Uh, I got a knock on the door.

07:36.448 --> 07:38.217
Do you know who it was?

07:38.283 --> 07:40.619
<i>My grandson, little willee.</i>

07:40.686 --> 07:43.122
Can you tell us
how a 10-year-old boy

07:43.188 --> 07:46.024
managed to get across town
through 10 miles

07:46.091 --> 07:47.926
of densely wooded forest

07:47.993 --> 07:50.929
in the middle of the night
on Christmas?

07:50.996 --> 07:52.598
<i>Uh, my guess is the injun.</i>

07:52.664 --> 07:54.867
<i>- The who?
- Native man.</i>

07:54.933 --> 07:56.235
Did you know the man?

07:56.301 --> 07:57.970
Never seen him
before in my life.

07:58.036 --> 08:00.239
Didn't say anything,
just left me the boy.

08:00.305 --> 08:02.040
<i>Mr. Stark,</i>

08:02.107 --> 08:04.376
<i>your behavior seems
very strange.</i>

08:04.443 --> 08:06.545
Uh, do you fully understand
what happened last night

08:06.612 --> 08:07.612
at your son's house?

08:09.815 --> 08:11.517
<i>Do you know
where your grandson is</i>

08:11.583 --> 08:13.318
<i>right now Mr. Stark?</i>

08:13.385 --> 08:15.096
Yeah. Right up there
on the first door on the right.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.955
Can we speak with him?

08:17.022 --> 08:19.024
<i>You can try,
but he hasn't said anything</i>

08:19.091 --> 08:20.592
<i>to anybody since he got here.</i>

08:20.659 --> 08:22.327
<i>Can you bring the camera?</i>

08:31.537 --> 08:32.771
William?

08:32.838 --> 08:34.506
Hey, willee?

08:34.573 --> 08:35.741
<i>He said the door on the right.</i>

08:35.808 --> 08:37.209
<i>On the right?</i>

08:37.276 --> 08:38.844
This never would've happen

08:38.911 --> 08:40.555
if Herman remembered
to lock the bulkhead, right?

08:40.579 --> 08:41.747
He's, uh...

08:41.814 --> 08:42.915
Willee?

08:42.981 --> 08:44.817
William, are you in here?

08:47.186 --> 08:48.754
<i>Don't look like he's here.</i>

08:50.422 --> 08:52.291
The closet.

08:52.357 --> 08:54.359
- William, is that you?
- Hey, buddy.

08:54.426 --> 08:56.261
<i>- Detective.
- Hey, willee.</i>

08:56.328 --> 08:57.663
<i>William, we're here to help you.</i>

08:57.729 --> 08:58.363
Come on.

08:58.430 --> 09:00.199
Mind coming out and speaking...

09:00.265 --> 09:01.667
- No!
- It's okay, bud.

09:01.733 --> 09:03.202
It's okay. It's okay.

09:03.268 --> 09:04.670
<i>Hey, Dave,
when are you coming in?</i>

09:04.736 --> 09:06.705
I told you the boy
doesn't wanna speak.

09:06.772 --> 09:07.806
No, thank you.

09:09.308 --> 09:10.676
Hey, what's going on up there?

09:10.742 --> 09:11.810
Detective.

09:11.877 --> 09:12.946
Leave him alone!

09:44.910 --> 09:45.911
Hello?

09:45.979 --> 09:47.279
Realtor showing.

09:57.689 --> 09:59.591
Hello?

09:59.658 --> 10:01.593
Realtor showing.

11:08.527 --> 11:09.561
Rita.

11:09.628 --> 11:10.762
Hey.

11:10.829 --> 11:12.331
<i>How's it working over there?</i>

11:12.397 --> 11:13.933
The contractors quit.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.376
I'm not sure if the painters
are coming back.

11:15.400 --> 11:16.668
<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

11:16.735 --> 11:18.503
<i>Has anyone heard
from the son yet?</i>

11:18.570 --> 11:20.114
He'll have to pack up
his father's things

11:20.138 --> 11:21.607
before we can show the house.

11:21.673 --> 11:23.842
<i>Things just keep getting
worse for this family.</i>

11:23.909 --> 11:25.243
<i>So sad.</i>

11:25.310 --> 11:27.412
I just can't believe it.

11:27.479 --> 11:29.548
<i>This is definitely
a tough listing.</i>

11:29.615 --> 11:31.060
<i>I'll try to send
some buyers your way.</i>

11:31.084 --> 11:31.883
Yeah.

11:31.951 --> 11:32.884
<i>Hang in there.</i>

11:32.952 --> 11:34.553
Okay. Bye.

12:38.951 --> 12:39.951
Come here.

12:49.394 --> 12:51.030
<i>Well, good morning, everyone,</i>

12:51.097 --> 12:52.932
<i>and thank you for tuning in.</i>

12:52.999 --> 12:54.475
<i>Well, they say
if the lights aren't on,</i>

12:54.499 --> 12:55.901
<i>don't go knocking.</i>

12:55.968 --> 12:57.669
<i>But as you know,
we're always keeping</i>

12:57.736 --> 12:59.438
<i>our airwaves open for you.</i>

12:59.504 --> 13:02.041
<i>This is 93.7 deerfield's choice</i>

13:02.108 --> 13:03.809
<i>for easy listening.</i>

13:35.942 --> 13:36.942
Come here.

13:48.154 --> 13:49.755
Neil from Rose ledge.

13:49.821 --> 13:51.356
Yeah.

13:51.423 --> 13:52.557
Hey, Meadow.

13:53.960 --> 13:55.527
Hey, will,
we got a propane truck

13:55.594 --> 13:57.196
rollover down in deerfield.

13:57.262 --> 13:58.339
Why don't you grab
the service truck,

13:58.363 --> 13:59.598
have Owen take 70

13:59.664 --> 14:01.867
and I'll take the rotator?

14:01.934 --> 14:04.436
Yeah, well, I got this lawyer
on the phone, third time,

14:04.503 --> 14:05.813
calling about
your father's ashes,

14:05.837 --> 14:07.348
wondering when you're gonna
even come pick them up.

14:07.372 --> 14:08.473
Says it's urgent.

14:09.708 --> 14:11.309
If you need to talk, brother,

14:11.376 --> 14:12.511
I'm here.

15:14.773 --> 15:16.575
<i>My condolences</i>

15:16.641 --> 15:18.910
<i>on the untimely death
of your father.</i>

15:18.978 --> 15:21.546
<i>The family home was placed
into foreclosure</i>

15:21.613 --> 15:23.849
<i>after the bank had made
several attempts</i>

15:23.915 --> 15:27.786
<i>to recover some
delinquent mortgage payments</i>

15:27.853 --> 15:30.256
and they have since
assigned an agent

15:30.323 --> 15:32.291
who will help facilitate

15:32.357 --> 15:34.994
the actual sale of the home.

15:37.330 --> 15:38.730
When was the last time

15:38.797 --> 15:41.000
that you spoke
to your father, William?

15:42.534 --> 15:44.303
<i>Would you say weeks,</i>

15:44.369 --> 15:46.272
<i>or months,</i>

15:46.339 --> 15:47.606
or years?

15:47.672 --> 15:48.807
Uh, years.

15:51.843 --> 15:54.280
<i>Over the past 10 years,</i>

15:54.347 --> 15:58.217
<i>your father had been admitted
to mental health facilities</i>

15:58.284 --> 16:00.518
<i>throughout the state
of Massachusetts.</i>

16:00.585 --> 16:04.190
<i>He had treatment
for schizophrenia,</i>

16:04.257 --> 16:05.891
<i>psychotic episodes,</i>

16:05.958 --> 16:08.760
<i>and multiple
personality disorder.</i>

16:08.827 --> 16:10.662
<i>And with his health issues,</i>

16:10.729 --> 16:12.864
<i>he incurred medical expenses</i>

16:12.932 --> 16:14.399
<i>that he struggled to pay.</i>

16:17.036 --> 16:19.738
<i>With the home's
unfortunate history</i>

16:19.804 --> 16:21.773
<i>and with the Internet,</i>

16:21.840 --> 16:24.643
it's difficult
not to have people know

16:24.709 --> 16:26.012
what took place there,

16:26.078 --> 16:30.049
which unfortunately affects
the value of the home.

16:36.721 --> 16:38.823
<i>As the state appointed trustee,</i>

16:38.890 --> 16:41.994
<i>it is my duty, at the behest
of your father,</i>

16:42.061 --> 16:46.132
to transfer the title
of home ownership to you,

16:46.198 --> 16:48.134
the beneficiary.

16:49.901 --> 16:52.804
<i>And it was your father's wishes</i>

16:52.871 --> 16:56.108
<i>that his ashes be scattered
on the property.</i>

16:57.676 --> 17:01.080
This is yours,

17:01.147 --> 17:04.016
if you'll just sign
the line at the bottom

17:04.083 --> 17:05.817
of the document, please.

20:14.273 --> 20:16.641
Hey, what? What?

21:28.380 --> 21:29.481
Donovan.

21:30.815 --> 21:31.984
Where?

21:33.986 --> 21:35.853
No. It's just,

21:35.920 --> 21:37.623
when they said
"lateral transition",

21:37.690 --> 21:39.458
I didn't think
that meant "meter maid".

21:41.893 --> 21:43.362
I'm on my way.

21:45.598 --> 21:48.133
Ava! The bus is gonna be here.

21:48.200 --> 21:50.469
I wanna go back to Boston.

21:56.108 --> 21:58.210
No one even talks
to me at school.

21:59.211 --> 22:01.213
Well, I haven't talked to you.

22:01.280 --> 22:03.349
Well, that's just
'cause you're my mom.

22:03.716 --> 22:05.451
That's besides the point.

22:06.918 --> 22:08.287
Hey, I'm the new kid, too.

22:10.656 --> 22:12.358
We're in this together.

22:12.424 --> 22:13.659
Okay?

22:15.160 --> 22:16.428
All right. Don't be late.

22:16.495 --> 22:17.930
Okay. Bye. Love you.

22:17.997 --> 22:19.098
Okay. Love you, too.

22:47.126 --> 22:49.361
<i>Yeah, I just got here.</i>

22:49.794 --> 22:50.929
<i>All right.</i>

22:53.798 --> 22:55.668
I'll call you back.

22:56.302 --> 22:58.737
Two county precincts
and they send Boston homicide

22:58.803 --> 23:00.706
all the way out here
for a Fender bender?

23:00.773 --> 23:03.309
This doesn't violate
my visitation rights, does it?

23:03.375 --> 23:04.777
Very funny, drew.

23:04.842 --> 23:06.578
Would've appreciated a call.

23:06.645 --> 23:08.147
Come on now.

23:08.813 --> 23:10.115
How's Ava?

23:10.983 --> 23:12.251
Rough week at school.

23:12.318 --> 23:13.818
Having a hard time
making friends.

23:13.885 --> 23:16.155
She's a new kid. Every time.

23:16.221 --> 23:17.956
She misses her father... a lot.

23:20.559 --> 23:22.127
- Morning.
- Morning.

23:22.194 --> 23:24.039
- Neil from Rose ledge.
- I'm detective Donovan,

23:24.063 --> 23:25.397
- deerfield pd.
- Hey, what's up?

23:25.464 --> 23:27.008
This is detective Carter,
Boston homicide.

23:27.032 --> 23:28.310
We need to take
a look inside the vehicle

23:28.334 --> 23:29.544
- before you haul it off.
- All right.

23:29.568 --> 23:30.679
Let me know
when you're done, please.

23:30.703 --> 23:31.869
Thank you.

23:33.806 --> 23:35.708
What brings you out
to the sticks?

23:35.774 --> 23:37.009
Got a call this morning

23:37.076 --> 23:39.078
on a missing person case
I've been working.

23:39.144 --> 23:41.347
Local staties ran the plates,

23:41.413 --> 23:44.550
vehicle registered to a 34-year
old woman named Brittany o'shea,

23:44.616 --> 23:46.485
been missing since last month.

23:46.552 --> 23:49.555
And her daughter was found
murdered in Dorchester.

23:49.621 --> 23:51.090
Jesus.

23:51.156 --> 23:52.825
You think she was on the run?

23:52.890 --> 23:54.026
Maybe.

23:55.227 --> 23:57.629
Uh, she's from out here.

23:57.696 --> 23:58.931
I got a call into her family,

23:58.997 --> 24:02.034
so I'm gonna stop by
and pay them a visit.

24:02.368 --> 24:04.036
Oh, here we go.

24:04.103 --> 24:06.438
I'll take what's behind
door number one, monty.

24:11.110 --> 24:13.278
She flips the car,

24:13.345 --> 24:15.913
makes a run for it and calls
a friend to pick her up?

24:15.981 --> 24:17.416
Maybe.

24:17.483 --> 24:18.483
I think. For sure.

24:30.062 --> 24:31.597
Got everything you need?

24:34.633 --> 24:36.034
All set.

25:01.493 --> 25:03.173
Hey, Neil, you seen
the maintenance records

25:03.228 --> 25:04.830
- on truck 42?
- It should be

25:04.897 --> 25:06.217
in Herman's old
accounting office.

25:06.265 --> 25:07.499
Will, you mind looking?

26:35.621 --> 26:37.756
Hey, why is my mother's
piano in there?

26:37.823 --> 26:39.993
Oh, we put it there
when your father got sick

26:40.058 --> 26:42.194
and he started
working from home.

26:42.261 --> 26:44.563
He was convinced
it had a mind of his own.

26:44.630 --> 26:47.165
Said there was family
of mice living in it.

26:47.232 --> 26:49.167
We told him
we'd donate it to a church.

27:52.065 --> 27:53.231
Meadow?

28:39.745 --> 28:40.745
Girl?

29:54.386 --> 29:55.821
William,

29:55.887 --> 29:57.856
come in here
and play with your sister.

30:08.633 --> 30:11.269
I got it especially for you.

30:23.815 --> 30:25.985
Heading to New Hampshire
on a tow,

30:28.320 --> 30:29.956
won't be back till morning.

31:10.096 --> 31:11.496
Meadow?

31:13.099 --> 31:14.366
Girl?

31:33.852 --> 31:34.852
Meadow?

32:12.091 --> 32:13.525
Who are you?

33:26.098 --> 33:28.000
Where's the gift I gave you?

33:29.969 --> 33:31.037
What gift?

33:35.440 --> 33:37.509
They followed me home.

33:39.145 --> 33:40.645
Who followed you?

34:04.937 --> 34:06.238
Meadow?

34:52.517 --> 34:53.685
Meadow?

35:25.951 --> 35:27.319
Meadow?

35:41.300 --> 35:42.867
Girl?

35:45.770 --> 35:47.739
I'm watching you.

36:09.661 --> 36:11.663
Just got a call.

36:11.729 --> 36:13.832
Two snowshoers
in the deerfield area

36:13.898 --> 36:15.600
came across
the body of a female,

36:15.667 --> 36:17.136
aged twenties to thirties.

36:17.203 --> 36:18.736
Wow.

36:18.803 --> 36:20.772
You're really living out
the bachelor dream.

36:20.839 --> 36:22.841
I just decided
to stay in town for a while,

36:22.907 --> 36:24.909
you know, get case closure.

36:24.977 --> 36:28.180
Your case, my jurisdiction,
so my rules.

36:28.247 --> 36:29.381
No booze in the vehicle.

36:32.184 --> 36:33.727
You know, if you're ever down
for date night,

36:33.751 --> 36:35.687
this place has cable TV

36:35.753 --> 36:38.390
and a wicked
heart-shaped jacuzzi.

36:38.457 --> 36:41.427
You're not funny.
And please put your seatbelt on.

36:41.494 --> 36:43.262
I'm kind of funny.

36:43.329 --> 36:44.863
- No. You're not.
- I think I'm funny.

36:44.930 --> 36:47.665
- Ava thinks I'm funny.
- That... well, that makes one.

36:48.800 --> 36:50.035
One's all I need.

37:42.154 --> 37:44.490
I think we found
our Brittany o'shea.

37:44.557 --> 37:45.991
Fresh out of the big city

37:46.058 --> 37:48.194
and you already
got your first stiff.

37:48.928 --> 37:50.596
Did I ever tell you
about my first 10-54

37:50.663 --> 37:51.997
when I joined the force?

37:52.064 --> 37:54.300
No.
But I'm sure you will anyway.

37:54.366 --> 37:56.302
It was a mill worker from Gill.

37:57.236 --> 37:58.836
Jumped off the bascule bridge

37:58.903 --> 38:00.573
on the upswing
in the dead of winter.

38:00.639 --> 38:01.873
Ice broke his fall...

38:01.941 --> 38:03.042
And his legs.

38:04.243 --> 38:06.111
Unlucky for him,
the impact didn't kill him.

38:06.178 --> 38:07.879
- Morning.
- How you doing, sir?

38:10.082 --> 38:12.750
Poor bastard froze to death
by the time we found him.

38:15.087 --> 38:17.022
How I've missed
our morning chats.

38:22.027 --> 38:23.295
Goddamn. Jesus.

38:25.364 --> 38:27.333
Looks like
she's been out here a while.

38:37.543 --> 38:39.245
Yup. That's her.

38:42.181 --> 38:43.781
Did you take a look at this?

38:43.848 --> 38:45.817
Geez, what the hell are those?

38:50.623 --> 38:52.391
Man, looks like she was branded.

38:54.727 --> 38:57.029
Who were you running from,
Brittany?

40:11.903 --> 40:13.672
<i>Necrophiliacs
anonymous, may I help you?</i>

40:13.739 --> 40:14.740
<i>Very funny.</i>

40:14.807 --> 40:16.575
How's my favorite coroner?

40:16.642 --> 40:17.818
<i>We found
a match for the markings</i>

40:17.842 --> 40:19.611
<i>on the o'shea girl.</i>

40:19.678 --> 40:21.447
Really? Go ahead.

40:21.513 --> 40:22.781
<i>Have you ever heard</i>

40:22.880 --> 40:24.249
<i>of the stark/codder murders?</i>

40:28.120 --> 40:30.189
Will you pass me
a three-quarter wrench?

40:44.036 --> 40:46.105
Those are freakin'
bite marks bro.

40:46.171 --> 40:47.673
Maybe he's into kinky shit.

40:47.740 --> 40:49.608
No. Animal bites.

40:49.675 --> 40:50.851
How do you know the difference?

40:50.875 --> 40:52.177
I'm telling you, Owen.

40:52.244 --> 40:54.046
Something ain't right.

40:54.113 --> 40:56.215
When's anything
ever been right with will?

43:28.033 --> 43:31.136
You need to return it
to its rightful home, William,

43:32.170 --> 43:34.072
before it's too late.

44:48.380 --> 44:49.949
<i>William stark
was the only witness</i>

44:50.016 --> 44:51.783
<i>to the murders
of his mother and sister.</i>

44:51.850 --> 44:54.252
<i>He recently moved back
into town, and get this,</i>

44:54.319 --> 44:55.989
<i>he works for the company</i>

44:56.055 --> 44:58.290
<i>that towed Brittany's car
the other day.</i>

44:58.357 --> 45:00.392
<i>That is quite a coincidence.</i>

45:00.459 --> 45:02.361
<i>Now, I need to check this kid,</i>

45:02.427 --> 45:04.162
<i>see if we can fill in any holes.</i>

45:04.763 --> 45:05.763
Will?

45:06.431 --> 45:07.431
Will?

45:08.300 --> 45:10.168
William stark!

45:12.537 --> 45:14.306
Detective Carter
Boston homicide.

45:16.775 --> 45:17.775
You remember me. Yeah?

45:19.778 --> 45:21.322
Maybe you remember
the white Ford explorer

45:21.346 --> 45:22.423
that flipped over the other day?

45:22.447 --> 45:24.282
How many of those
you get this week?

45:27.386 --> 45:29.154
You recognize that vehicle,
will?

45:30.656 --> 45:32.959
I... I don't...
I don't think so. Why?

45:33.525 --> 45:35.494
Because it belongs
to Brittany o'shea,

45:36.895 --> 45:37.930
you know her, will?

45:40.232 --> 45:41.900
I... I don't... I don't know her.

45:43.268 --> 45:44.603
You don't know?

45:48.340 --> 45:49.274
Hey, would you give us a moment?

45:49.341 --> 45:50.542
Certainly.

45:50.609 --> 45:51.609
Thank you.

45:56.481 --> 45:57.883
Let me rephrase that,

46:01.620 --> 46:04.523
when was the last time you saw
or spoke to Brittany o'shea?

46:07.325 --> 46:08.694
I don't know.

46:09.361 --> 46:10.762
So you knew her?

46:11.763 --> 46:13.765
Yeah, well,
you must've seen the vehicle

46:13.832 --> 46:16.936
was registered in her name
when you did the tow report.

46:17.003 --> 46:19.939
You didn't think, I don't know
maybe I should mention this

46:20.006 --> 46:23.275
to the two cops on the scene,
I knew the driver.

46:24.944 --> 46:28.613
Things have just been
kind of a blur lately.

46:28.981 --> 46:30.415
Where were you Tuesday night?

46:31.783 --> 46:33.986
Am I in some kind of
trouble here?

46:36.122 --> 46:37.823
I don't know.

46:37.889 --> 46:38.889
Are you?

46:44.229 --> 46:46.264
We found the body
of Brittany o'shea

46:47.432 --> 46:50.203
near the deerfield river
yesterday, will,

46:50.268 --> 46:51.503
and a few weeks before that

46:51.570 --> 46:53.538
I found the body
of her daughter.

46:55.707 --> 46:56.908
That's terrible.

46:58.376 --> 46:59.911
Yeah, it's terrible,

47:04.316 --> 47:06.651
and you hadn't spoken
to her anytime recently?

47:07.719 --> 47:09.439
I couldn't tell you
what Brittany looks like

47:09.488 --> 47:11.890
if she was standing
in front of me today.

47:15.594 --> 47:17.429
Or if she was running away
from you.

47:20.332 --> 47:22.334
I have to get back to work.

47:26.605 --> 47:29.075
Look, this was
an informal visit,

47:29.942 --> 47:31.610
we can go down
to the precinct to make it

47:31.676 --> 47:33.946
much more formal
if that's what you prefer.

47:39.152 --> 47:40.652
Thanks for your time, will.

47:40.719 --> 47:42.679
If we need anything else
I know where to find you.

47:48.460 --> 47:49.828
Just leaving
the stark workplace,

47:49.895 --> 47:52.098
that dude
is creepy Magoo times two.

47:52.165 --> 47:54.934
Class a weirdo
and when the going gets weird,

47:55.001 --> 47:56.902
the weird turn pro.

47:56.969 --> 47:58.403
Pull the stark murder files.

48:37.375 --> 48:39.045
<i>We discovered
a tap on your case, sir,</i>

48:39.111 --> 48:41.113
<i>I'm terribly sorry
for your loss.</i>

48:41.180 --> 48:43.149
<i>At this point in time,
Mr. Carter's priority</i>

48:43.216 --> 48:45.117
<i>is finding your son.</i>

48:45.184 --> 48:46.818
<i>Do you know where you son is?</i>

48:50.189 --> 48:52.591
<i>Mr. Stark, I need you
to pull it together.</i>

48:52.657 --> 48:54.093
<i>It's 10 degrees outside.</i>

48:54.160 --> 48:55.927
<i>We need to find your son
right now.</i>

48:57.263 --> 48:58.697
<i>Mr. Stark, where is your son?</i>

49:11.944 --> 49:14.046
<i>My name is detective Coleman.</i>

49:14.113 --> 49:15.991
<i>I'm gonna ask you
some questions about last night</i>

49:16.015 --> 49:18.084
<i>and I want you to do your best
to answer them</i>

49:18.150 --> 49:20.886
<i>and understand, you're not
in any trouble at all, okay?</i>

49:20.953 --> 49:22.654
<i>We just need to know
what happened.</i>

49:24.123 --> 49:25.123
<i>Hey, Willie.</i>

49:26.458 --> 49:28.127
<i>Hey, how you doing?</i>

49:28.194 --> 49:30.062
<i>There is a...
There's a lady outside</i>

49:30.129 --> 49:31.796
<i>saying she's a family.</i>

49:31.863 --> 49:33.665
<i>All right.
Let me talk to the family.</i>

49:37.802 --> 49:39.771
<i>Willie, how are you doing, bud?</i>

49:39.838 --> 49:41.673
<i>I see you still have
your elephant.</i>

49:43.808 --> 49:46.112
<i>It's pretty cool actually,
where did you get it?</i>

49:48.281 --> 49:49.281
<i>You're grandpa...</i>

49:50.983 --> 49:53.818
<i>Said that you came over
to his house the other night,</i>

49:54.486 --> 49:57.555
<i>you ran from your house
to his house</i>

49:58.823 --> 50:02.661
<i>in the middle
of the night in the snow.</i>

50:03.162 --> 50:04.162
<i>You'd be freezing.</i>

50:05.998 --> 50:07.878
<i>He said that you were running
with someone else.</i>

50:07.934 --> 50:09.201
<i>Were you running with a man?</i>

50:12.104 --> 50:14.773
<i>All right then,
I'm gonna give you a second,</i>

50:14.839 --> 50:16.641
<i>I'm gonna talk
to detective Coleman</i>

50:16.708 --> 50:18.476
<i>and, uh, we'll be back in, okay?</i>

50:36.128 --> 50:37.529
<i>Atlantow.</i>

50:49.607 --> 50:51.043
<i>Atlantow.</i>

51:36.288 --> 51:37.722
Hey, Neil?

51:40.359 --> 51:42.128
You still here?

52:23.402 --> 52:24.569
Girl?

52:27.173 --> 52:28.974
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

52:30.675 --> 52:33.345
Okay. Okay.

52:33.412 --> 52:35.347
Just stay right here.

52:35.414 --> 52:37.416
I'm not gonna hurt you.

52:37.483 --> 52:38.583
Just sit right here.

52:39.952 --> 52:41.153
Right here. It's okay.

52:45.157 --> 52:46.157
Okay. Okay.

52:47.725 --> 52:49.995
We... we'll just talk, okay?

52:50.062 --> 52:51.062
Let's talk.

52:52.098 --> 52:55.167
You don't have to be afraid.
It's okay.

52:55.234 --> 52:57.136
It's okay. We... we can...
We'll just sit here.

52:57.203 --> 52:59.737
We'll just sit here
and we can talk

52:59.804 --> 53:01.840
just like old times,
just like old times.

53:07.413 --> 53:08.413
I missed old times.

53:12.952 --> 53:14.886
<i>You weren't
ready to go back, you know,</i>

53:14.954 --> 53:16.654
we shouldn't have went back.

53:16.721 --> 53:17.990
You shouldn't have went back.

53:18.057 --> 53:20.326
<i>Okay. And then that's my fault</i>

53:20.392 --> 53:21.392
<i>and... and I'm sorry.</i>

53:23.596 --> 53:25.498
It's my father.

53:25.564 --> 53:26.698
My father...

53:28.467 --> 53:31.836
- <i>The prophecy.</i>
- You know, he, um...

53:31.903 --> 53:34.173
Well, that's where I got it from

53:34.240 --> 53:36.075
<i>and his father.</i>

53:36.142 --> 53:38.043
<i>It was my father's side
of the family.</i>

53:39.677 --> 53:41.514
It was medication.

53:41.580 --> 53:43.681
It was a medication you get.

53:43.748 --> 53:45.683
You're going one way,
you're going the next way,

53:45.750 --> 53:46.851
and... and you just...

53:46.918 --> 53:48.853
I've never been sick before.

53:48.920 --> 53:50.389
I always said no.

53:50.456 --> 53:53.325
I didn't want it
and they gave it to me.

53:53.392 --> 53:55.161
I was too young.

53:55.227 --> 53:56.227
Something bit me.

53:59.898 --> 54:01.600
It was the voices.

54:01.666 --> 54:03.202
It's the voices.

54:04.503 --> 54:06.472
So I could just... it takes you.

54:06.539 --> 54:07.805
He wants me to build it.

54:09.175 --> 54:11.243
She doesn't let go.
I have to build it.

54:11.544 --> 54:12.744
But it doesn't let go.

54:15.014 --> 54:16.724
<i>And then he... she can't...
You can't do anything.</i>

54:16.748 --> 54:18.951
<i>You... you just argue him.</i>

54:19.018 --> 54:21.020
<i>She sleeps to me in my dreams.</i>

54:21.086 --> 54:22.921
<i>I feel the prophecy.</i>

54:22.988 --> 54:25.723
<i>Are you him? I can't breathe.</i>

54:25.790 --> 54:26.891
<i>I can't breathe.</i>

54:28.994 --> 54:30.762
I can't breathe.
Okay. Okay. Okay.

54:38.971 --> 54:40.472
Uh, not again, will.

54:44.009 --> 54:45.743
I think you need some time off.

56:01.020 --> 56:02.820
<i>That's what I said.</i>

56:02.887 --> 56:04.165
<i>He was looking right up
at the camera and he said,</i>

56:04.189 --> 56:07.626
<i>spirit of death in mohican.</i>

56:07.693 --> 56:09.261
<i>You kidding me?</i>

56:09.328 --> 56:11.297
<i>Where do you think
he picked that up?</i>

56:11.363 --> 56:13.232
William starks'
grandfather reported that a man

56:13.299 --> 56:14.899
of native descent
dropped him off

56:14.967 --> 56:17.136
the morning after the murders.

56:17.202 --> 56:19.471
The next day, child services
came to pick him up.

56:19.538 --> 56:21.940
I mean, his grandfather
was unfit to take care of him,

56:22.007 --> 56:23.542
and they kept running into dead
ends

56:23.609 --> 56:25.210
looking for this mysterious man.

56:27.246 --> 56:29.982
The... the strangest thing
I can't find though is that

56:30.049 --> 56:31.849
the bloody pajamas will
was wearing

56:31.916 --> 56:34.420
the night of the murders
disappeared from the precinct

56:34.486 --> 56:37.556
when this woman stopped by
with some clean clothes for him.

56:40.959 --> 56:42.894
Are you and Ava
watching cartoons?

56:42.961 --> 56:46.298
I am. She's doing her homework.

56:46.365 --> 56:48.300
Look, I just don't buy
that a 10-year-old

56:48.367 --> 56:51.869
could wield an axe and inflict
that kind of carnage.

56:51.937 --> 56:54.406
Sorry, honey.

56:54.473 --> 56:55.907
<i>I did a search on the markings</i>

56:55.974 --> 56:57.576
<i>on Brittany o'shea's body,</i>

56:57.643 --> 56:59.078
portrayed upside down.

56:59.144 --> 57:01.380
- They signify death.
- <i>I'm more curious</i>

57:01.447 --> 57:04.383
how o'shea's toxicology report
comes back.

57:04.450 --> 57:06.285
Look, I got to head back
into Boston tonight,

57:06.352 --> 57:09.355
- <i>so you got Ava.</i>
- I got a babysitter for her.

57:09.421 --> 57:11.923
<i>It's this nice lady
from down the street.</i>

57:11.990 --> 57:15.160
<i>You get a warrant
for the stark place, yet?</i>

57:15.227 --> 57:18.130
Not yet. But I'm working on it.

57:32.211 --> 57:33.779
Can I get you boys
anything else?

57:33.846 --> 57:35.880
Chocolate mousse cake,
apple pie?

57:35.948 --> 57:37.149
Well, we're stuffed.

57:37.216 --> 57:38.984
Full circle. Thanks.

57:39.051 --> 57:41.153
You should get home
before that nor'easter moves in.

57:41.220 --> 57:43.021
Supposed to get
another six inches.

57:43.088 --> 57:44.423
Dunkees on route 24 is 24 hours.

57:44.490 --> 57:46.291
Now if you guys
want more coffee.

57:46.358 --> 57:48.327
Closing early. Storms coming in.

57:48.394 --> 57:50.028
Just a quick one for the ditch.

57:50.095 --> 57:51.630
The sign says closed, Caleb.

57:51.697 --> 57:52.697
Not actually.

57:56.135 --> 57:57.878
I think that's the guy
whose family got hacked

57:57.902 --> 57:59.505
by a hiker.

57:59.571 --> 58:02.141
We get lost hikers knocking
on our door all the time.

58:02.207 --> 58:04.243
No. They say the house
is haunted.

58:04.309 --> 58:05.910
We should not sneak
into it sometime.

58:05.978 --> 58:08.046
Crime scene photos are nuts!

58:08.113 --> 58:09.848
He even scalped them.

58:09.914 --> 58:12.017
Oh my god. That's nasty!

58:12.084 --> 58:13.685
Guys, that's disgusting.

58:13.752 --> 58:14.953
Oh my god.

58:15.020 --> 58:16.488
Go on.

58:19.224 --> 58:20.492
You all done here guy?

58:22.394 --> 58:24.463
He just lost the only family
he's got left.

58:24.530 --> 58:25.531
Have a little respect.

58:31.303 --> 58:33.272
- You causing problems?
- He was just leaving.

58:34.339 --> 58:35.407
- Ready to go?
- Yeah.

58:38.043 --> 58:39.511
Be safe out there, boys.

58:39.578 --> 58:41.480
Have a great night, cayley.

58:44.650 --> 58:46.452
Deerfield pd!

58:49.521 --> 58:50.521
Hello?

58:51.857 --> 58:53.258
Deerfield pd.

58:59.498 --> 59:00.966
Hello?

59:33.499 --> 59:35.334
Deerfield pd!

59:57.589 --> 59:59.057
Somebody there?

1:00:23.482 --> 1:00:24.650
Hello?

1:02:06.618 --> 1:02:07.618
Who's there?

1:03:13.086 --> 1:03:15.353
Oh, my god.

1:04:00.532 --> 1:04:03.368
Everyone's sleeping.
I got the last jar of jam.

1:04:03.435 --> 1:04:05.637
Merry Christmas, mister.

1:04:22.989 --> 1:04:25.724
Oh, I can't do it

1:04:25.791 --> 1:04:28.261
I don't know
why you keep singing it

1:04:28.326 --> 1:04:29.861
over and over again.

1:04:29.928 --> 1:04:30.928
No, I keep, shit.

1:04:34.900 --> 1:04:39.939
No, because it attracts

1:04:40.006 --> 1:04:42.275
shut up, god.

1:04:54.753 --> 1:04:55.753
All right.

1:05:28.420 --> 1:05:29.956
Little girl, is that you?

1:05:32.024 --> 1:05:34.626
Hello? Little girl?

1:06:56.508 --> 1:06:58.344
Join with me

1:06:58.411 --> 1:07:01.680
and thou shall ne'r
hunger again.

1:07:14.893 --> 1:07:18.530
Thou might not but dispatch
the mother and daughter,

1:07:18.596 --> 1:07:22.034
and retrieve the endowment.

1:08:54.226 --> 1:08:55.226
Where is it?

1:08:57.662 --> 1:08:59.932
Help, my baby!

1:09:25.657 --> 1:09:28.726
<i>Thou know'st whom I am.</i>

1:09:57.722 --> 1:09:59.258
Ava?

1:10:10.169 --> 1:10:11.237
Ma'am?

1:10:28.020 --> 1:10:30.655
I'm so sorry,
I'm riding behind today.

1:10:30.722 --> 1:10:31.991
I just had a lot of work.

1:10:32.057 --> 1:10:35.027
Oh, not to worry,
Ava was in good hands.

1:10:36.495 --> 1:10:39.898
Um, well, thank you
for staying late tonight.

1:10:39.965 --> 1:10:41.500
Um, what do I owe you?

1:10:41.567 --> 1:10:45.237
Oh, no, no,
I couldn't, it was my pleasure.

1:10:47.705 --> 1:10:48.840
Thank you.

1:10:49.441 --> 1:10:50.441
Thank you.

1:11:01.086 --> 1:11:03.721
Ava?

1:11:12.764 --> 1:11:14.466
I wanna go back to Boston.

1:11:19.071 --> 1:11:22.007
You used to love coming to Nana
and papa's farmhouse.

1:11:22.074 --> 1:11:24.043
They're dead
and this place sucks.

1:11:27.279 --> 1:11:30.416
Ava, what are you doing
in there?

1:11:30.482 --> 1:11:32.850
I was scared.

1:11:32.917 --> 1:11:35.688
What? Why were you scared?

1:11:35.753 --> 1:11:36.989
My friend bit me.

1:11:40.259 --> 1:11:42.461
What friend?

1:11:42.528 --> 1:11:44.196
She's a ballerina.

1:11:45.497 --> 1:11:47.166
Ava, I need you
to come out right now,

1:11:47.233 --> 1:11:48.866
- so I could see you.
- No.

1:11:50.768 --> 1:11:53.606
Ava, don't make me come
in there.

1:11:53.672 --> 1:11:54.806
No.

1:11:58.344 --> 1:12:00.946
I promise
I'll take you to Fenway.

1:12:01.013 --> 1:12:02.348
Green monster seats?

1:12:04.450 --> 1:12:06.252
In the spring,
green monster seats.

1:12:26.038 --> 1:12:28.040
Wayne codder, 40-year-old hiker

1:12:28.107 --> 1:12:30.342
from Oklahoma gets lost
in deerfield trails,

1:12:30.409 --> 1:12:32.511
he's about to freeze to death,
he's starving,

1:12:32.578 --> 1:12:35.381
he comes across the stark house.

1:12:35.447 --> 1:12:37.849
Herman stark who doesn't
even have the wherewithal

1:12:37.915 --> 1:12:40.252
on codder's desperation,

1:12:40.319 --> 1:12:42.354
sends him on his way
with a loaf of bread.

1:12:45.057 --> 1:12:46.791
You're not gonna talk about it?

1:12:54.967 --> 1:12:57.636
Hikers get lost all the time.

1:12:57.703 --> 1:13:01.006
Camping out in yards,
knocking on doors at all hours.

1:13:03.075 --> 1:13:05.077
They find codder's DNA?

1:13:05.144 --> 1:13:06.745
Forensics only found it on jars

1:13:06.811 --> 1:13:08.123
in the shed
and the murder weapon.

1:13:08.147 --> 1:13:10.349
Jars? What jars?

1:13:10.416 --> 1:13:13.686
- Only in the shed?
- Yeah.

1:13:13.752 --> 1:13:15.887
My theory? Codder would sneak
into the stark house

1:13:15.954 --> 1:13:17.589
late at night
when everybody was asleep,

1:13:17.656 --> 1:13:20.492
feast on jarred fruit,
sneak back out before sunrise

1:13:20.559 --> 1:13:22.860
where he'd hide out in the shed.

1:13:22.927 --> 1:13:24.330
Okay.

1:13:24.396 --> 1:13:25.707
But why murder
an innocent family?

1:13:25.731 --> 1:13:26.864
What's the motive?

1:13:29.168 --> 1:13:31.836
He murders a mother and daughter

1:13:31.903 --> 1:13:33.572
and is found dead of hypothermia

1:13:33.639 --> 1:13:35.639
miles from the house
with the same markings we find

1:13:35.674 --> 1:13:38.243
on Brittany o'shea's body
25-some-odd years later?

1:13:38.310 --> 1:13:41.480
Like there's gotta be more
to it.

1:13:48.053 --> 1:13:49.521
What was the deal
with the father?

1:13:49.588 --> 1:13:50.888
Herman stark had a history

1:13:50.956 --> 1:13:53.158
of mental health issues.

1:13:53.225 --> 1:13:56.729
Uh, psychotic episodes,
schizophrenia,

1:13:56.795 --> 1:13:58.330
multiple personality disorders.

1:13:58.397 --> 1:14:01.266
He was put on a 5150
the day after the murders

1:14:01.333 --> 1:14:02.900
and was in and out
of psych wards

1:14:02.968 --> 1:14:06.472
for the last 25 years,
until he killed himself.

1:14:06.538 --> 1:14:07.538
Jesus.

1:14:11.977 --> 1:14:13.612
How does a 70-year-old man

1:14:13.679 --> 1:14:17.850
with severe rheumatoid arthritis
reported as near crippling

1:14:17.915 --> 1:14:20.486
managed to even get himself
in a 20-foot high beam?

1:14:23.989 --> 1:14:25.624
Shit ton of bath salts.

1:14:29.194 --> 1:14:30.271
Firefighters had a hell
of a time

1:14:30.295 --> 1:14:32.197
getting him down from there.

1:14:32.264 --> 1:14:34.366
Someone must've
put him up there.

1:14:35.734 --> 1:14:36.734
Or something.

1:14:42.674 --> 1:14:45.077
Do you remember that couple
back in the '70s

1:14:45.144 --> 1:14:47.513
they did paranormal
investigations?

1:14:47.579 --> 1:14:49.815
She was a medium
and they would collect things

1:14:49.882 --> 1:14:52.084
that souls would attach
themselves to?

1:14:52.151 --> 1:14:53.552
Of course I remember,
they made like

1:14:53.619 --> 1:14:55.421
half a dozen movies
about those clowns.

1:14:57.723 --> 1:14:59.391
You really going with this, huh?

1:15:01.693 --> 1:15:05.297
Is it possible that this
could be a paranormal entity?

1:15:05.364 --> 1:15:06.999
Yeah, it's possible.

1:15:09.134 --> 1:15:11.870
Yeah. It's possible.

1:15:11.937 --> 1:15:13.305
But what do you think,

1:15:13.372 --> 1:15:15.407
some kind of possessed doll
put him up there?

1:15:15.474 --> 1:15:17.018
Because I don't see
Chucky carrying a geriatric...

1:15:17.042 --> 1:15:19.411
- I'm serious, drew.
- I'm serious too.

1:15:19.478 --> 1:15:21.280
I just think that
we need to go back

1:15:21.346 --> 1:15:22.524
- to the stark house and...
- Go back?

1:15:22.548 --> 1:15:24.416
- Talk to will and maybe...
- No, no.

1:15:24.483 --> 1:15:26.060
- We get some more answers...
- What you need to do is go...

1:15:26.084 --> 1:15:28.044
- About this.
- Back to Boston and take Ava.

1:15:28.954 --> 1:15:31.423
Take some real time off,
go to a bruins game.

1:15:31.490 --> 1:15:32.667
That's what coming
to the farmhouse was supposed...

1:15:32.691 --> 1:15:33.701
Get her away from the neighbor's
kid who likes to bite.

1:15:33.725 --> 1:15:35.227
That's what coming to the
farmhouse

1:15:35.294 --> 1:15:36.638
- was supposed to be, drew.
- Yeah. It was supposed to be

1:15:36.662 --> 1:15:38.932
a break from all the stress
that got you put on leave

1:15:38.997 --> 1:15:41.233
in the first place.

1:15:41.300 --> 1:15:42.968
Wow.

1:15:43.035 --> 1:15:45.604
What are you not telling me?

1:15:45.671 --> 1:15:47.539
What?

1:15:47.606 --> 1:15:49.107
You're not still seeing
that mass hole

1:15:49.174 --> 1:15:50.542
- from Cambridge are you?
- No.

1:15:50.609 --> 1:15:52.187
Because I thought maybe
now that I was back in town...

1:15:52.211 --> 1:15:53.712
- No.
- You and I could try,

1:15:53.779 --> 1:15:55.223
- but if I... I...
- Drew just stop it.

1:15:55.247 --> 1:15:57.149
Ava's asleep right now.

1:16:07.826 --> 1:16:10.662
Just go.

1:16:10.729 --> 1:16:12.564
Go? You're kicking me out?

1:16:12.631 --> 1:16:14.399
I have a lot of work
I need to do

1:16:14.466 --> 1:16:16.068
before I get Ava for school.

1:20:38.064 --> 1:20:42.001
<i>The vitality of thee bloodline.</i>

1:20:42.068 --> 1:20:47.606
<i>Mother and daughter
bring 'em hither.</i>

1:20:58.717 --> 1:21:00.119
<i>What'd you got?</i>

1:21:00.186 --> 1:21:02.554
Still waiting on toxicology.

1:21:02.621 --> 1:21:05.124
Did speak
to Brittany o'shea's parents.

1:21:05.191 --> 1:21:07.793
<i>Said she'd been hanging with
some pretty scary characters.</i>

1:21:07.859 --> 1:21:10.062
<i>They were afraid she's joined
some sort of a cult.</i>

1:21:10.129 --> 1:21:12.031
Cult?

1:21:12.098 --> 1:21:13.832
You got a name for this group?

1:21:13.899 --> 1:21:15.300
<i>Negative.</i>

1:21:15.367 --> 1:21:16.969
But we did spend
two exciting hours

1:21:17.036 --> 1:21:18.804
going over yearbooks,

1:21:18.870 --> 1:21:20.615
see if there was anybody
that she went to school with

1:21:20.639 --> 1:21:23.009
that might know
of her whereabouts.

1:21:23.075 --> 1:21:24.676
Any luck?

1:21:24.743 --> 1:21:26.778
<i>Found a fourth grade
photo of Brittany o'shea</i>

1:21:26.845 --> 1:21:29.015
<i>and one young will stark.</i>

1:21:29.081 --> 1:21:30.758
The two were inseparable
leading up to the stark murders

1:21:30.782 --> 1:21:33.219
before will went
into protective care.

1:21:33.286 --> 1:21:34.619
And get this.

1:21:34.686 --> 1:21:36.122
They even managed
to stay in touch,

1:21:36.189 --> 1:21:38.924
writing letters with tribal-type
drawings on them.

1:21:38.991 --> 1:21:42.327
You think he might be a member
or involved in this cult?

1:21:42.394 --> 1:21:44.063
<i>Could be.</i>

1:21:44.362 --> 1:21:45.764
If not, he might know who is.

1:21:50.036 --> 1:21:52.205
Where are you?

1:21:52.271 --> 1:21:53.705
I'm gonna text you coordinates.

1:21:53.772 --> 1:21:55.383
If you don't hear from me
in the next hour,

1:21:55.407 --> 1:21:57.742
get a search party ready.

1:21:57.809 --> 1:21:59.611
Don't do anything reckless,
Carrie.

1:22:01.847 --> 1:22:04.083
Reckless?

1:22:04.150 --> 1:22:06.052
Like you knock me up
on our first date

1:22:06.118 --> 1:22:10.089
only to break our family apart
for a cashier in a stop n' plop?

1:22:10.156 --> 1:22:12.357
No, I'm not that reckless.

1:24:35.867 --> 1:24:37.669
I've been expecting you.

1:24:39.305 --> 1:24:40.305
Come inside.

1:25:09.768 --> 1:25:11.736
Wife and daughter?

1:25:11.803 --> 1:25:13.272
My mother and sister.

1:25:19.711 --> 1:25:20.812
It's an old photo.

1:25:24.649 --> 1:25:25.951
They're beautiful.

1:25:26.018 --> 1:25:27.253
Thanks.

1:25:29.654 --> 1:25:31.157
They live here with you?

1:25:32.757 --> 1:25:34.126
They're no longer with us.

1:25:36.295 --> 1:25:37.629
I'm sorry to hear that.

1:25:39.697 --> 1:25:41.633
They were taken from me.

1:25:42.501 --> 1:25:43.635
Taken?

1:25:43.701 --> 1:25:45.504
By who?

1:25:45.570 --> 1:25:47.440
Not by who.

1:25:47.506 --> 1:25:49.874
By what.

1:25:50.675 --> 1:25:52.545
Centuries ago,

1:25:52.610 --> 1:25:54.280
when the colonizers came here

1:25:54.346 --> 1:25:56.449
to these shores,

1:25:56.515 --> 1:25:58.551
they brought with them conquest,

1:25:58.616 --> 1:26:00.319
christianity,

1:26:00.386 --> 1:26:02.288
violence,

1:26:02.354 --> 1:26:03.354
and prosperity.

1:26:05.690 --> 1:26:07.059
Also a whole plethora
of diseases

1:26:07.126 --> 1:26:09.161
that all but wiped out
the indigenous people

1:26:09.228 --> 1:26:10.795
of these lands.

1:26:10.862 --> 1:26:12.498
All but the sinchanee.

1:26:12.565 --> 1:26:14.300
My ancestors,

1:26:14.366 --> 1:26:16.801
whose bloodline is immune.

1:26:16.868 --> 1:26:19.771
The settlers, they were afraid.

1:26:19.838 --> 1:26:21.073
They didn't understand.

1:26:23.175 --> 1:26:24.909
And what you fear

1:26:24.977 --> 1:26:27.679
and what you don't understand,

1:26:27.745 --> 1:26:29.814
you destroy.

1:26:29.881 --> 1:26:32.952
Destroyed by who?

1:26:33.018 --> 1:26:35.054
By him.

1:26:35.121 --> 1:26:36.989
Are... are you talking
about the devil?

1:26:38.390 --> 1:26:39.390
Atlantow.

1:26:41.460 --> 1:26:42.460
The spirit of death.

1:26:46.098 --> 1:26:48.200
Wasn't devil worshipping
in the native culture

1:26:48.267 --> 1:26:50.902
just a stereotype

1:26:50.970 --> 1:26:53.838
created by settlers
to justify the genocide

1:26:53.905 --> 1:26:56.041
of the indigenous people?

1:26:56.108 --> 1:26:56.942
True.

1:26:57.009 --> 1:26:59.345
But atlantow is real.

1:26:59.411 --> 1:27:01.779
And it was the settlers
that worshipped him.

1:27:13.858 --> 1:27:15.995
I've got a girl
whose frozen body

1:27:16.061 --> 1:27:18.297
was found with strange symbols

1:27:18.364 --> 1:27:19.831
carved in her flesh.

1:27:19.898 --> 1:27:22.767
I found geographic
coordinates in a journal

1:27:22.834 --> 1:27:25.171
of hers that led me here

1:27:25.237 --> 1:27:27.672
to you.

1:27:27.739 --> 1:27:28.950
Can you tell me why
a mother of four

1:27:28.974 --> 1:27:30.543
was so desperate to get to you

1:27:30.609 --> 1:27:32.777
that she would drive
in the middle of the night

1:27:32.844 --> 1:27:34.846
until she ran out of gas,

1:27:34.913 --> 1:27:36.649
and then continue
her journey on foot

1:27:36.714 --> 1:27:39.118
until she froze to death?

1:27:39.185 --> 1:27:41.020
Other than to protect
her daughter?

1:27:42.687 --> 1:27:44.990
Protect her daughter from who?

1:27:45.057 --> 1:27:47.259
Those that summoned atlantow.

1:27:47.326 --> 1:27:50.795
Those that seek
to kill and destroy

1:27:50.862 --> 1:27:53.065
the bloodline of the sinchanee.

1:27:53.132 --> 1:27:56.734
Our mothers, our sisters,

1:27:56.801 --> 1:27:58.037
those who can conceive.

1:28:05.877 --> 1:28:07.680
Do you know your heritage?

1:28:26.498 --> 1:28:29.368
Hey, I'll run block
while you check the shed.

1:28:29.435 --> 1:28:31.036
All right.

1:30:02.294 --> 1:30:03.294
Drew!

1:30:06.131 --> 1:30:07.865
Drew, you need to come see this.

1:30:10.369 --> 1:30:12.638
Help!

1:30:12.705 --> 1:30:14.506
Help!

1:30:14.573 --> 1:30:15.573
Hello?

1:30:19.578 --> 1:30:21.347
Kid?

1:30:21.413 --> 1:30:22.413
You okay?

1:30:25.084 --> 1:30:26.218
Hello?

1:30:29.021 --> 1:30:30.089
Hey, little girl.

1:30:33.092 --> 1:30:34.193
Say something.

1:30:40.766 --> 1:30:41.967
Kid, I'm not messing around.

1:30:42.034 --> 1:30:44.470
Say something.

1:30:44.536 --> 1:30:45.671
Shit!

1:31:56.575 --> 1:31:58.210
Hey! Hey!

1:32:04.082 --> 1:32:06.051
Drew!

1:32:06.118 --> 1:32:08.987
Drew! We need to go!

1:32:09.054 --> 1:32:11.890
Hey! Hey!

1:32:11.957 --> 1:32:13.525
Please no!
No! It was just a prank!

1:32:13.592 --> 1:32:15.427
It was just a prank!
I just wanted to see

1:32:15.494 --> 1:32:16.938
- if the house was haunted!
- On the ground! Drop it!

1:32:16.962 --> 1:32:18.664
Put it down! Right now!

1:32:18.730 --> 1:32:20.132
Please no! No!

1:32:20.199 --> 1:32:22.468
Put it down right now!
Right now!

1:32:22.534 --> 1:32:24.503
Put the goddamn
axe on the ground!

1:32:24.570 --> 1:32:26.839
Put it on the ground! Right now!

1:32:26.905 --> 1:32:29.074
I'm moving, Donovan.

1:32:29.141 --> 1:32:30.181
- Put it down.
- Goddammit,

1:32:30.209 --> 1:32:31.743
drop the axe.

1:32:33.011 --> 1:32:35.514
Put it down now!

1:32:35.581 --> 1:32:36.748
Goddammit, drop it!

1:32:38.817 --> 1:32:39.985
Drop the goddamn axe!

1:32:45.424 --> 1:32:47.092
Kid, get the hell out of here.

1:32:55.267 --> 1:32:56.602
You have something of ours.

1:33:00.906 --> 1:33:02.641
The hell is he talking
about, Carrie?

1:33:05.511 --> 1:33:07.045
We want it back.

1:33:11.316 --> 1:33:13.318
Now get off my land.

1:33:14.887 --> 1:33:15.887
Hey. Hey.

1:33:19.993 --> 1:33:21.159
Let's go.

1:33:31.637 --> 1:33:35.440
- Brittany o'shea!
- Hey. Hey. Stop.

1:33:35.507 --> 1:33:37.185
- What happened to her, will?
- Hey, let's go.

1:33:37.209 --> 1:33:38.477
We gotta go home.

1:33:38.544 --> 1:33:41.413
Did you do something
to her? Huh?

1:33:41.480 --> 1:33:43.048
- Detective!
- You know something,

1:33:43.115 --> 1:33:44.850
- don't you?
- Carrie, let's go.

1:33:44.917 --> 1:33:46.528
- Did you do something to her?
- Carrie, let's go.

1:33:46.552 --> 1:33:47.930
- We gotta go.
- You did something to her?

1:33:47.954 --> 1:33:49.364
- Did you kill her, will?
- We'll come back with a warrant.

1:33:49.388 --> 1:33:50.428
He's getting in your head.

1:33:50.489 --> 1:33:51.489
Come on.

1:34:02.434 --> 1:34:04.037
- Mother and daughter.
- What?

1:34:04.102 --> 1:34:05.537
- Come on.
- Ava.

1:34:05.604 --> 1:34:07.040
- What...
- We need to go.

1:34:07.105 --> 1:34:09.308
We need to go! We need to go!

1:34:22.021 --> 1:34:23.722
Where did you say we're going?

1:34:23.789 --> 1:34:26.458
<i>Hello? Dorothy?
Yeah. Are you with Ava?</i>

1:34:26.525 --> 1:34:29.695
- What is she saying?
- Ava Carter!

1:34:29.761 --> 1:34:31.506
- Hello? Hello?
- What did... what did she say?

1:34:31.530 --> 1:34:34.266
Goddammit.

1:34:34.333 --> 1:34:35.767
What is going on?

1:34:35.834 --> 1:34:37.669
I went to this dark house
last weekend and...

1:34:37.736 --> 1:34:39.504
- And nobody was home.
- And? And? And?

1:34:39.571 --> 1:34:41.440
And I went inside
and some things...

1:34:41.506 --> 1:34:42.985
What the hell happened
in that house, Carrie?

1:34:43.009 --> 1:34:44.309
Something grabbed me!

1:34:44.376 --> 1:34:46.211
I felt something, and it was...

1:34:46.278 --> 1:34:47.479
I don't know what it was

1:34:47.546 --> 1:34:48.948
but I shouldn't have taken it.

1:34:49.015 --> 1:34:50.158
I couldn't submit it
for evidence!

1:34:50.182 --> 1:34:51.259
Well, we can take it back, okay?

1:34:51.283 --> 1:34:53.885
No, we can't! No, we can't!

1:34:53.953 --> 1:34:56.388
It's... it's me! It's me!

1:34:56.455 --> 1:34:57.556
What are you talking about?

1:34:57.623 --> 1:35:00.392
"A mother and daughter,"
it says.

1:35:00.459 --> 1:35:02.527
I... I... I don't understand.

1:35:02.594 --> 1:35:05.597
- I need you to drive!
- I'm driving!

1:35:23.715 --> 1:35:26.251
Grace?

1:35:26.318 --> 1:35:28.754
Where'd you go?

1:35:28.820 --> 1:35:29.820
Grace?

1:35:45.170 --> 1:35:46.304
Grace?

1:36:07.859 --> 1:36:08.859
Grace?

1:36:12.531 --> 1:36:14.266
I thought you said
we were gonna play

1:36:14.332 --> 1:36:15.467
in the forest?

1:36:53.172 --> 1:36:54.606
Gotcha!

1:37:02.748 --> 1:37:04.916
Come on.
We're gonna go to my house.

1:37:08.787 --> 1:37:11.289
- Ava!
- Ava!

1:37:12.491 --> 1:37:15.293
- Ava!
- She in there?

1:37:15.360 --> 1:37:16.461
No!

1:37:17.496 --> 1:37:20.265
Ava!

1:37:20.332 --> 1:37:22.267
Ava!

1:37:22.334 --> 1:37:23.468
Dorothy!

1:37:25.370 --> 1:37:26.939
Ava!

1:37:27.006 --> 1:37:28.807
Solomon.

1:37:28.874 --> 1:37:30.076
Solomon! We need to go!

1:37:30.143 --> 1:37:31.510
- We need to go!
- Who is Solomon?

1:37:31.576 --> 1:37:32.677
Come on!

1:37:38.884 --> 1:37:41.486
I should probably
be getting home now.

1:37:41.553 --> 1:37:44.023
We're going to play at my house.

1:37:44.090 --> 1:37:46.391
But I'm starting to get cold.

1:37:46.458 --> 1:37:47.559
Come on. Let's go.

1:38:14.586 --> 1:38:15.821
Ava!

1:38:15.887 --> 1:38:17.522
Ava!

1:38:17.589 --> 1:38:18.690
- Ava!
- Ava!

1:38:20.892 --> 1:38:21.892
Ava!

1:38:23.795 --> 1:38:24.795
Ava!

1:38:27.499 --> 1:38:29.135
You're hurting me!

1:38:29.202 --> 1:38:30.669
It's just a little further.

1:38:30.735 --> 1:38:33.371
My brother really
wants to meet you.

1:38:33.438 --> 1:38:36.042
I really need to go home now.

1:38:36.108 --> 1:38:38.144
You're coming with me.

1:38:38.211 --> 1:38:39.278
No!

1:38:41.280 --> 1:38:42.914
Let go!

1:38:49.155 --> 1:38:50.289
Solomon?

1:38:50.355 --> 1:38:51.523
Solomon?

1:39:08.174 --> 1:39:10.309
<i>I'm watching you.</i>

1:39:10.375 --> 1:39:11.509
Ava!

1:39:24.422 --> 1:39:25.624
Ava!

1:39:28.460 --> 1:39:30.296
It's okay.

1:39:30.363 --> 1:39:31.496
It's okay.

1:39:34.233 --> 1:39:35.433
Give me the arrowhead.

1:39:37.802 --> 1:39:39.171
I'll take it from here.

1:39:39.238 --> 1:39:40.238
Go on home.

1:39:54.519 --> 1:39:57.123
Carrie! Carrie! Her scarf!

1:39:57.189 --> 1:39:58.189
Where did you...

1:40:00.492 --> 1:40:02.194
Ava!

1:40:02.261 --> 1:40:03.595
Mom! Dad!

1:40:03.662 --> 1:40:04.763
- Ava!
- Ava!

1:41:04.256 --> 1:41:07.193
<i>Fulfill the covenant</i>

1:41:07.759 --> 1:41:13.065
<i>and join me
in eternal exaltation.</i>

1:41:45.597 --> 1:41:47.599
Atlantow!

1:42:02.982 --> 1:42:04.783
<i>Atlantow!</i>

1:42:04.849 --> 1:42:07.253
We are still here!

1:42:07.319 --> 1:42:08.686
You have not driven us out!

1:42:11.023 --> 1:42:15.094
Father sky, mother earth,

1:42:15.161 --> 1:42:19.597
<i>brother wolf, and sister moon,
I call upon you!</i>

1:42:19.664 --> 1:42:22.567
Come down! You must help dispel

1:42:22.634 --> 1:42:25.570
this evil from our sacred land!

1:42:31.444 --> 1:42:32.610
He's here. He's here.

1:42:36.748 --> 1:42:38.117
<i>Do you not see him?</i>

1:42:41.454 --> 1:42:42.587
Run!

1:42:45.424 --> 1:42:47.560
<i>Atlantow!</i>

1:42:47.625 --> 1:42:50.029
I've done battle
with you before!

1:42:50.096 --> 1:42:53.731
I've defeated you before!
I will defeat you again!

1:43:07.079 --> 1:43:08.280
Atlantow!

1:43:08.347 --> 1:43:09.347
Demon! Stop!

1:43:13.185 --> 1:43:14.185
Devil!

1:43:15.287 --> 1:43:16.522
Monster!

1:43:16.589 --> 1:43:18.524
We will drive you out!

1:43:28.100 --> 1:43:30.035
I cast you out!

1:43:30.102 --> 1:43:32.171
I cast you out!

1:43:32.238 --> 1:43:34.739
I cast you out!

1:44:20.785 --> 1:44:22.321
You came back.

1:44:24.523 --> 1:44:25.958
You are my blood.

1:44:27.359 --> 1:44:28.893
Sinchanee blood.

1:44:35.800 --> 1:44:37.469
Sinchanee medicine.

1:44:39.672 --> 1:44:41.906
Medicine of your people.

1:44:42.274 --> 1:44:44.009
Here, put the arrow
at the heart.

1:44:50.616 --> 1:44:51.783
Drink.

1:44:55.454 --> 1:44:57.590
Your mother,

1:44:57.656 --> 1:45:00.192
your sister,

1:45:00.492 --> 1:45:04.230
you, will, sinchanee.

1:45:06.365 --> 1:45:08.234
And you we are the last.

1:45:16.375 --> 1:45:18.510
Stay strong, will.

1:45:20.778 --> 1:45:21.913
Stay strong.

1:45:30.556 --> 1:45:32.291
You're brave, will.

1:45:36.894 --> 1:45:39.764
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

1:45:39.831 --> 1:45:42.167
Be brave will.

1:45:42.234 --> 1:45:43.234
Be brave.

1:45:46.171 --> 1:45:48.806
<i>Atlantow, we cast you out</i>

1:45:48.873 --> 1:45:51.977
from this sacred land!

1:45:53.279 --> 1:45:55.014
Stay in the course.

1:45:55.481 --> 1:45:56.881
Stay in the course.

1:45:56.949 --> 1:45:58.651
<i>No. No.</i>

1:45:58.717 --> 1:46:00.519
<i>- Keep going.
- No, no, no.</i>

1:46:00.586 --> 1:46:02.454
- Keep going.
- No, no.

1:47:33.846 --> 1:47:35.481
You came back to me.

1:48:48.987 --> 1:48:51.056
I guess I owe you an apology.

1:48:57.930 --> 1:48:58.930
Where you heading?

1:48:58.964 --> 1:49:00.566
Road trip.

1:49:11.043 --> 1:49:12.711
I'm here when you're ready
to talk.

1:49:21.353 --> 1:49:24.690
As soon as the department gets
the funds that they requested,

1:49:24.756 --> 1:49:27.392
who knows what secrets
they'll dig up around here.

1:49:29.328 --> 1:49:32.231
You know, you probably
don't wanna do that.

1:49:36.635 --> 1:49:38.437
See you around, will.

1:51:26.411 --> 1:51:28.413
Hold on, Emerson.

1:51:37.656 --> 1:51:39.616
You don't even have
to lock the doors around here.

1:51:39.658 --> 1:51:40.726
Gotta love that.

1:51:40.792 --> 1:51:42.728
Oh, I know.

1:51:42.794 --> 1:51:46.164
This is gonna be the perfect
new start to our little family.

1:51:49.334 --> 1:51:53.138
And we got a few minutes
before the movers get here.

1:51:55.607 --> 1:51:57.142
Where's Emerson?

1:51:57.209 --> 1:51:59.344
Uh, she's just trying
to find her new room.

1:52:05.550 --> 1:52:06.818
Emerson?

1:52:08.520 --> 1:52:10.422
Emerson? Where did you go, baby?

1:52:14.860 --> 1:52:15.927
There you are.

1:52:15.995 --> 1:52:17.295
You scared, mommy.

1:52:18.463 --> 1:52:20.298
Where did you get those?

1:52:28.141 --> 1:52:30.043
It's a secret.
