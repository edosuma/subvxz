WEBVTT

02:03.207 --> 02:04.373
How is Bjorn?

02:06.418 --> 02:07.501
Better.

02:12.507 --> 02:15.051
I don't understand
why we failed, Ragnar.

02:15.552 --> 02:18.387
I did everything
to make sure
we would succeed.

02:25.312 --> 02:27.605
The others will
try again tonight.

04:56.546 --> 04:57.880
They're
on the bridge!

05:19.611 --> 05:20.611
Pour the oil!

05:32.165 --> 05:33.999
The Antichrist and
the devils are here.

05:34.084 --> 05:35.459
I pray to God
and our Holy Mother

05:35.544 --> 05:36.710
that they
will not get in.

05:36.795 --> 05:38.796
But if, God forbid,
they were to do so,

05:38.880 --> 05:40.798
make sure they do
not capture you alive.

06:55.790 --> 06:57.333
Withdraw!

07:10.847 --> 07:13.641
Sinric,
you're coming with us.

07:14.059 --> 07:16.602
You're our map
of the city!

07:19.898 --> 07:20.898
Release!

08:15.787 --> 08:17.746
Retract! Again!

08:34.055 --> 08:35.055
Move!

08:54.409 --> 08:55.618
Prepare!

08:56.620 --> 08:57.786
It won't move!

08:58.288 --> 08:59.455
Rollo!

09:39.204 --> 09:41.372
Princess!
Princess, please.

10:24.207 --> 10:25.666
Ah!

10:36.052 --> 10:38.554
Your Highness!
Your Highness!

10:39.055 --> 10:40.180
You have to come.

10:41.558 --> 10:42.641
Why?

10:42.726 --> 10:44.893
The Northmen are
almost inside the city.

10:46.062 --> 10:50.065
What can I do to
stop them that the
Holy Mother cannot do?

10:50.358 --> 10:51.525
The men
are so hard-pressed.

10:51.609 --> 10:54.111
So many killed,
so many wounded,
I cannot count them.

10:54.195 --> 10:55.487
But if you were
to walk among them,

10:55.572 --> 10:56.989
it would renew
their courage.

10:57.073 --> 10:59.491
It would restore
their strength,
just to see you.

10:59.576 --> 11:03.328
Why? Does it not
give them courage
to see you?

11:03.413 --> 11:05.372
You are their
commander.

11:05.457 --> 11:07.249
You are their emperor.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.380
I beg you. In the name
of the Holy Mother,
I beg you.

11:13.506 --> 11:16.383
Come with me now.
Come with me before
it is too late.

11:18.261 --> 11:20.763
You cannot speak
for her, Count Odo.

11:21.473 --> 11:24.475
I thought you would come!
I thought I would
not have to plead.

11:24.559 --> 11:27.352
Not when you heard
that our beloved city
was in mortal danger.

11:27.437 --> 11:29.313
And why did you
think that, pray?

11:29.397 --> 11:31.940
Because I know
what your grandfather
would have done.

11:34.444 --> 11:37.488
He would have put on
his armor and come
with us to the bridge.

11:39.073 --> 11:43.243
Alas for you, Count Odo,
I am not like my grandfather.

11:43.411 --> 11:45.120
I am not Charlemagne.

12:10.146 --> 12:11.146
Come!

12:19.823 --> 12:23.242
Count Odo! I put
my men at your disposal.

12:23.326 --> 12:24.660
The devils are not
attacking the walls!

12:24.744 --> 12:25.786
Thank God.
Come quickly!

12:25.870 --> 12:27.329
It may not be too late.

13:05.869 --> 13:06.869
Ah!

13:18.214 --> 13:20.757
Rollo! We can't
get through!

13:22.552 --> 13:24.094
Fall back!

13:27.348 --> 13:29.016
Fall back!

15:24.674 --> 15:27.050
Don't abandon me.

16:12.054 --> 16:15.015
I am told you
speak our language,

16:15.099 --> 16:17.726
but you were
with our enemies.

16:17.852 --> 16:21.062
I have been here before.
I am a wanderer.

16:21.147 --> 16:25.400
I have been to many places.
No one is my enemy.

16:27.403 --> 16:31.907
He can, perhaps,
be of great help to us.

16:31.991 --> 16:35.327
I would love to be
of great help to you.
Whatever it is you wish.

16:35.411 --> 16:38.079
I belong to no country,
I belong to no people.

16:38.164 --> 16:42.083
I just belong to
the wide, wide world.

16:43.920 --> 16:46.254
Who is that?

16:46.798 --> 16:48.215
Earl Siegfried.

16:56.808 --> 16:59.601
There was someone else.
A great warrior.

17:00.311 --> 17:03.063
He spiked our machine
and he did it alone.

17:03.689 --> 17:08.777
I have never seen
a man of such strength
and such violence.

17:09.237 --> 17:10.654
Who is he?

17:10.988 --> 17:12.614
His name is Rollo.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.908
He is the brother
of King Ragnar,

17:14.992 --> 17:16.618
the leader
of the Northmen.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.037
He is a famous
warrior.

17:19.372 --> 17:22.290
He fights like
a crazy bear.

17:23.125 --> 17:27.128
Your Highness, this man,

17:27.755 --> 17:30.090
Sinric, will be
of use to us.

17:30.424 --> 17:31.591
And this earl?

17:34.303 --> 17:38.223
Perhaps he could be bartered,
fetch us a good price.

17:38.307 --> 17:40.725
If you care for me
at all, Count Odo,

17:40.810 --> 17:42.310
you will bring
me his head.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.210
You wanted
to see me, my Lord?

18:07.295 --> 18:09.004
Yes, yes.

18:11.173 --> 18:14.509
How are you?
How are my grandsons?

18:15.177 --> 18:16.595
How is Alfred?

18:17.346 --> 18:18.597
Both are well.

18:18.681 --> 18:19.848
Good.

18:22.768 --> 18:26.897
I have received news that
my son and your husband,

18:27.023 --> 18:29.608
Aethelwulf, is even
now returning home.

18:30.401 --> 18:35.697
His mission in
Mercia was successful,
I'm pleased to say.

18:36.866 --> 18:39.117
Thank God.

18:39.201 --> 18:40.201
Indeed.

18:41.537 --> 18:42.954
Thank God.

18:52.131 --> 18:53.214
Judith,

18:54.842 --> 18:59.888
there are some things
that need to be said,

19:00.222 --> 19:05.018
but other things which
only need to be understood.

19:07.855 --> 19:10.148
I've promised
you faithfully

19:10.232 --> 19:12.901
that I will protect
you and your sons,

19:12.985 --> 19:16.655
especially Alfred,
against anyone

19:16.739 --> 19:20.241
who might offer you
or him some injury.

19:24.038 --> 19:26.748
You do understand what
I'm talking about, don't you?

19:28.584 --> 19:32.587
We both know what
my son is capable of.

19:47.436 --> 19:51.898
My protection
I freely offer.

19:53.401 --> 19:55.276
But...

19:56.445 --> 19:58.780
there must be recompense.

20:00.783 --> 20:02.325
Recompense.

20:03.077 --> 20:07.622
My Lord, some reward?

20:09.417 --> 20:14.129
Of course, some reward.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.234
Who is this young man?

20:36.318 --> 20:37.694
His name is Ansgar.

20:37.778 --> 20:39.070
What is he
accused of?

20:39.155 --> 20:41.239
He is a stranger,
a Christian,

20:41.323 --> 20:43.742
a missionary,
so he claims.

20:43.993 --> 20:45.910
He has been
in the marketplace

20:45.995 --> 20:47.829
denouncing our gods.

20:51.542 --> 20:52.709
Is it true?

20:53.335 --> 20:54.919
It's true that
I begged the people here

20:55.004 --> 20:59.049
to desist from
worshipping false gods
and serving the devil.

20:59.508 --> 21:01.259
Your gods are made
with human hands

21:01.343 --> 21:04.012
and are deaf,
dumb and blind.

21:05.473 --> 21:07.682
What salvation
can they bring you?

21:08.184 --> 21:10.602
Who, being senseless,
can save themselves?

21:15.524 --> 21:18.526
I may admit that
your Christ is a god.

21:19.695 --> 21:21.571
But even so,
our gods are greater,

21:21.655 --> 21:23.615
their signs and
wonders mightier.

21:23.699 --> 21:25.116
Is it not true?

21:25.201 --> 21:26.701
Yeah!

21:27.745 --> 21:29.037
No!

21:29.330 --> 21:30.955
God the Father,
the Son

21:31.040 --> 21:33.708
and the Holy Ghost
are the one God!

21:33.793 --> 21:36.127
The rest are
just false idols!

21:42.802 --> 21:44.969
And will you subject
your bold assertions

21:45.054 --> 21:47.430
to the judgment
of the gods?

21:51.393 --> 21:52.560
I will.

22:14.125 --> 22:15.625
Let us begin.

26:01.894 --> 26:06.189
What might have been
is an abstraction,

26:07.357 --> 26:10.068
remaining
a perpetual possibility

26:10.152 --> 26:12.987
only in the world
of speculation.

26:13.072 --> 26:18.409
What might have been
and what has been
point to one end,

26:19.244 --> 26:21.704
which is always present.

26:23.874 --> 26:27.668
Footsteps echo
in the memory...

26:28.462 --> 26:30.755
Is the reward
what I think it is?

26:32.257 --> 26:36.177
...down the passage
we did not take,

26:36.762 --> 26:39.764
towards the door
we never opened.

26:39.848 --> 26:41.140
I don't understand.

26:41.767 --> 26:47.939
Somehow, we are always
here at this moment,

26:48.607 --> 26:49.857
you and I.

26:51.610 --> 26:55.738
No, not always.
Just now.

26:58.534 --> 26:59.992
You're wise.

27:00.994 --> 27:02.578
I'm not stupid.

27:12.714 --> 27:15.216
The moon
is a strange god.

27:20.055 --> 27:22.557
I want you to
be my mistress.

27:26.645 --> 27:29.147
Then you will
protect Alfred?

27:29.231 --> 27:30.314
Look after him?

27:44.079 --> 27:45.371
Get into the bed.

28:05.267 --> 28:06.267
Come to me,

28:07.144 --> 28:08.144
my King,

28:10.814 --> 28:11.814
my Lord.

28:49.686 --> 28:52.939
My God. My God.

28:55.150 --> 28:56.484
So many.

29:00.155 --> 29:02.031
Your Highness,
in the last few days,

29:02.115 --> 29:03.866
over 200 of our
citizens have succumbed

29:03.951 --> 29:05.743
to this unknown
sickness and died.

29:05.994 --> 29:07.912
God knows how many more
will likewise die.

29:08.830 --> 29:10.581
What's more,
we're running out of

29:10.666 --> 29:11.874
fresh vegetables,
fresh food.

29:11.959 --> 29:13.876
The city is
beginning to starve.

29:16.964 --> 29:20.049
And yet, we won
a great victory?

29:20.133 --> 29:21.759
We may have
repelled the pagans

29:21.843 --> 29:23.344
and stopped them
from entering the city,

29:23.512 --> 29:25.388
but that is not
exactly a victory.

29:26.473 --> 29:29.350
Who knows?
The next time they
may well succeed.

29:30.018 --> 29:32.561
Your Highness,
we have lost
too many good men.

29:50.247 --> 29:52.039
What is your advice?

29:52.499 --> 29:55.126
I believe we must attempt
to come to terms with them.

29:55.210 --> 29:56.419
There is, alas,
no other way.

29:56.503 --> 29:59.505
Father, I beg you,
ignore this counsel
of despair.

29:59.715 --> 30:02.967
We should never give in
to these vile pagans,
to these brutes.

30:03.051 --> 30:04.635
Otherwise
we will have failed,

30:04.720 --> 30:06.554
and that is how
we would be judged.

30:07.055 --> 30:08.347
Your Highness,
I think you must...

30:08.432 --> 30:11.100
Allow me some
time to decide!

30:19.526 --> 30:23.070
I understand both
these points of view,

30:25.657 --> 30:29.410
but I must pray
alone and try...

30:30.579 --> 30:34.165
And try to discover
the will of God.

31:18.001 --> 31:21.045
A toast to my son.

31:22.172 --> 31:26.509
I give thanks to God
for your success
and safe return.

31:27.219 --> 31:28.886
Thank you, Father.

31:32.307 --> 31:34.892
I confess to you that

31:34.976 --> 31:37.603
Queen Kwenthrith
tried to use her
female wiles upon me,

31:37.687 --> 31:42.441
but with God's help,
I managed to resist
the devil's snares.

31:44.069 --> 31:46.821
I always knew
she'd try to win
you over that way.

31:48.156 --> 31:49.824
It's in her nature.

31:50.909 --> 31:52.660
It's what she does.

31:53.537 --> 31:57.623
But I also knew
that you would be
able to resist her,

31:58.166 --> 32:01.836
for your morals and faith
are such as even I look up to.

32:04.339 --> 32:05.673
I'm sure your wife

32:06.174 --> 32:09.718
is also happy to hear
that you avoided
temptation.

32:14.516 --> 32:16.225
Of course.

32:16.893 --> 32:21.814
But I am not so
much of a hypocrite
as to say so.

32:23.942 --> 32:25.526
No longer
be afraid of that.

32:26.194 --> 32:28.529
However painful
it was for me,

32:28.947 --> 32:33.742
what happened between
you and Athelstan
was God's work.

32:34.536 --> 32:36.370
It was for
a higher purpose.

32:37.038 --> 32:39.707
And although I can't even
guess at that purpose,

32:40.125 --> 32:42.293
I am prepared to bow
before God's will.

32:44.212 --> 32:46.881
I praise your
attitude, my son.

32:47.674 --> 32:52.136
If only we were
all so humble
and so righteous.

32:53.013 --> 32:59.727
However, there is something
I need to ask you, Father.

33:00.187 --> 33:03.939
And you must forgive me,
but there is no help for it.

33:06.234 --> 33:10.446
I need to ask you
whether you were prepared,

33:10.530 --> 33:14.158
secretly, to let
Kwenthrith kill me

33:14.409 --> 33:15.951
as the price you
were prepared to pay

33:16.036 --> 33:17.578
for the conquest
of Mercia.

33:20.290 --> 33:22.374
I was not.

33:26.630 --> 33:29.006
And frankly, the
accusation shocks me.

33:38.225 --> 33:40.100
Let me say this to you,

33:41.937 --> 33:46.023
no Saxon king
has ever managed

33:46.107 --> 33:48.442
to hand over their
kingdom peacefully

33:48.526 --> 33:51.528
and successfully to
their son and heir.

33:52.447 --> 33:54.531
But I intend
to be the first.

33:55.492 --> 33:58.327
And what I intend
to pass on to you

33:58.411 --> 34:00.913
is not only the
kingdom of Wessex,

34:01.831 --> 34:03.499
but the kingdom
of England!

34:13.343 --> 34:15.970
Well, let me,
in turn,

34:16.054 --> 34:19.723
raise a toast
to my father.

34:20.850 --> 34:23.811
The most loving, loyal,

34:24.646 --> 34:28.148
and true father
in the world.

34:37.867 --> 34:38.993
My son.

35:29.502 --> 35:31.045
Sinric.

35:32.047 --> 35:34.298
I am saddened to
see you a prisoner.

35:35.258 --> 35:38.510
After all,
you're a wanderer.

35:42.557 --> 35:44.141
King Ragnar,

35:44.768 --> 35:47.519
the Franks want
to discuss a way
to end the siege.

35:47.604 --> 35:48.729
Why?

35:49.939 --> 35:52.066
They believe it
would be better
for both sides.

35:52.150 --> 35:54.068
Why would that
be better for us?

35:55.111 --> 35:56.403
They don't believe
you are capable

35:56.488 --> 35:58.197
of breaching
the city walls.

35:58.281 --> 35:59.865
I say we are!

35:59.949 --> 36:02.868
What will they give us
if we lift the siege?

36:03.912 --> 36:05.871
That would be
decided at a meeting

36:05.955 --> 36:09.041
between you
and the commander
of the city, Count Odo.

36:10.335 --> 36:12.920
And where would
we have this meeting?

36:13.004 --> 36:16.340
Because I know
that if my father
enters the city,

36:16.716 --> 36:18.967
he will be captured
or killed.

36:20.428 --> 36:22.262
The Count suggested
the meeting take place

36:22.347 --> 36:24.139
outside the city walls,

36:24.224 --> 36:25.641
with no weapons.

36:26.726 --> 36:28.936
Tell them they'll have
their answer tomorrow.

36:57.549 --> 36:59.299
Why should we
make any kind
of deal with them?

36:59.426 --> 37:00.759
We've lost
nearly a thousand men,

37:00.844 --> 37:02.886
we can't breach the city,
and winter is coming.

37:02.971 --> 37:04.471
Do you need
more reasons?

37:04.931 --> 37:08.100
Why do they offer terms,
if they are so sure
we can't get into the city?

37:08.184 --> 37:09.810
They have probably
run out of food.

37:09.894 --> 37:11.728
Then we should
let them starve.

37:11.813 --> 37:12.771
Ah, then they
will hate us even more.

37:12.856 --> 37:15.524
They will hate us even more
if we continue the siege.

37:16.651 --> 37:18.152
I have something to say.

37:21.906 --> 37:25.576
I did not become earl
because I aspired to be one.

37:26.703 --> 37:29.830
It came about
because of other
peoples' actions.

37:31.791 --> 37:34.585
And I did not become
king out of ambition.

37:34.669 --> 37:38.422
But once again,
I had no choice,

37:39.174 --> 37:42.634
as a result of other
people's actions.

37:43.386 --> 37:46.221
But nonetheless, I am king.

37:48.183 --> 37:50.100
King Ragnar! Hmm.

37:50.185 --> 37:53.228
That is my name.
King Ragnar!

37:55.857 --> 37:57.983
What does
a king do, Bjorn?

37:59.861 --> 38:01.820
- He rules.
- Yes!

38:01.946 --> 38:04.239
Good. He rules.

38:05.158 --> 38:06.533
And as a ruler, I...

38:10.705 --> 38:12.748
Have the last say.

38:12.832 --> 38:14.249
Me!

38:15.293 --> 38:17.294
Not you! Not you!

38:17.378 --> 38:19.963
Not you! And not you!

38:23.760 --> 38:26.053
You have all
had your ideas,

38:26.137 --> 38:28.388
and they have
all failed!

38:30.725 --> 38:33.227
I will not.

38:48.409 --> 38:51.411
Now, with no more
discussion,

38:52.121 --> 38:54.039
we shall meet
the Franks tomorrow.

39:08.805 --> 39:10.055
Come with me.

39:28.658 --> 39:29.908
Give him to me.

39:31.494 --> 39:32.869
Ivar.

39:37.625 --> 39:38.917
Hmm.

39:39.377 --> 39:41.086
Ivar.

39:48.052 --> 39:49.177
What is it?

39:49.470 --> 39:51.388
What should we do
with the Christian?

39:53.474 --> 39:54.641
Kill him.

40:10.700 --> 40:12.326
Ragnar is not here.

40:13.286 --> 40:14.745
He's already left.

40:25.757 --> 40:28.675
How much treasure
do you want to lift
the siege and go away?

40:41.022 --> 40:44.399
5,760 pounds in
gold and silver.

40:56.329 --> 40:57.913
He urges you to
accept the offer.

40:57.997 --> 41:00.207
Reinforcements are
on their way to Paris.

41:03.711 --> 41:07.255
Tell him I know that
no one is coming
to save him.

41:09.675 --> 41:11.259
And the
offer is not enough.

41:12.428 --> 41:16.973
There is something I also seek
that has no tangible worth,

41:17.683 --> 41:19.142
but to me is more precious.

41:24.190 --> 41:26.441
I want to be baptized.

41:32.990 --> 41:34.574
He doesn't understand.

41:34.951 --> 41:36.618
I am a dying man.

41:37.328 --> 41:38.745
And when I die,

41:39.497 --> 41:42.707
I want to be reunited
with my Christian friend,

41:42.792 --> 41:44.876
who happens to be
in your heaven.

41:52.552 --> 41:55.095
He says you will go
to hell, not heaven.

41:59.934 --> 42:02.227
That is not your
decision to make.

42:05.898 --> 42:07.858
They will
make arrangements
for the ceremony.

42:08.276 --> 42:10.777
This is a man of God,
is it not?

42:13.990 --> 42:18.410
And this is water,
am I wrong?

42:18.661 --> 42:21.621
You will do it here,
and you will do it now.
