00:04.016 --> 00:05.652
Hello, everybody!

00:05.684 --> 00:08.613
Oh, hey, Aunt Jackie.

00:08.638 --> 00:09.906
Haven't seen you in a while.

00:09.931 --> 00:11.767
You and Peter must be
really hitting it off.

00:11.792 --> 00:13.629
Uh, actually, my days are free.

00:13.661 --> 00:15.029
You know Peter... he's got his classes

00:15.062 --> 00:17.031
in early European culture,

00:17.065 --> 00:19.133
and he's a falconer in training

00:19.167 --> 00:20.368
at the Renaissance Faire.

00:22.136 --> 00:24.440
He wears tights.

00:24.473 --> 00:26.709
Kind of put me off at first,

00:26.741 --> 00:27.976
but now I dig it.

00:30.045 --> 00:31.145
I don't get it.

00:31.179 --> 00:32.680
It's just a bunch of smelly hippies

00:32.713 --> 00:34.516
running around eating giant turkey legs.

00:35.883 --> 00:37.652
Ooh, I was shot at by the Taliban

00:37.685 --> 00:39.387
so people could do that.

00:39.420 --> 00:41.389
Well, well, well, looky here,

00:41.423 --> 00:44.860
- it's a letter from the City of Lanford.
- I know what that is...

00:44.892 --> 00:47.529
"Clean up your yard or we'll do it."

00:47.562 --> 00:48.630
All right, gang,

00:48.663 --> 00:50.199
anything you don't want,
put in the yard.

00:50.231 --> 00:51.966
Nope.

00:51.999 --> 00:54.369
It's a permit to start construction

00:54.402 --> 00:56.204
on a backyard chicken coop.

00:56.237 --> 00:58.506
Oh, I waited at the mailbox
for two weeks

00:58.539 --> 00:59.507
and it comes today.

01:01.609 --> 01:03.378
This is gonna be great.
I applied for this

01:03.411 --> 01:06.481
so we could have eggs
that are organic and healthy,

01:06.514 --> 01:08.216
and think about how much money
we're gonna save.

01:08.249 --> 01:11.137
How big do you think our egg budget is?

01:12.454 --> 01:14.256
No way we're doing this.

01:14.289 --> 01:17.192
You won't even know it's here.
I'll handle everything.

01:17.224 --> 01:18.726
Except, of course, building it.

01:18.760 --> 01:20.895
You'd have to do that.

01:20.929 --> 01:22.698
We don't need to build anything.

01:22.730 --> 01:26.524
I think the chickens will be
plenty warm right in here.

01:28.203 --> 01:29.204
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:29.236 --> 01:30.738
- Hey.
- Hi, kids. How was school today?

01:30.772 --> 01:33.175
And wouldn't coming home be even better

01:33.207 --> 01:35.343
if you had your very own chicken coop?

01:35.376 --> 01:36.711
We're getting a chicken coop?

01:36.745 --> 01:38.713
I want that so bad!

01:38.746 --> 01:40.748
What is it?

01:40.781 --> 01:42.417
Mary, what would you name your chicken?

01:42.459 --> 01:43.494
Don't.

01:45.587 --> 01:48.433
Cornflakes. I love her so much already!

01:49.257 --> 01:50.400
Please, Grandpa?

01:50.425 --> 01:52.528
We don't have any pets.

01:52.561 --> 01:55.863
I have no way to pay forward
the love you give me.

02:00.335 --> 02:01.703
Please, Grandpa Dan?

02:01.736 --> 02:03.038
Fine.

02:03.070 --> 02:06.108
I'll build you a chicken coop.

02:06.141 --> 02:08.276
Well, if we don't make
the hillbilly hall of fame now,

02:08.309 --> 02:10.464
I don't know what else we can do.

02:13.280 --> 02:14.816
Is Aunt Jackie picking me up soon?

02:14.850 --> 02:16.552
Pretty soon.

02:16.584 --> 02:18.153
Now that you're done with the tables,

02:18.185 --> 02:20.189
I'm gonna let you
marry all the ketchups.

02:22.156 --> 02:25.726
No kid has been allowed
to do that before.

02:25.760 --> 02:27.262
We're reading "Tom Sawyer" this year.

02:27.295 --> 02:28.597
I know what you're doing.

02:30.965 --> 02:33.535
You know, I was as smart as you,
and look what happened!

02:35.550 --> 02:36.605
Mark ready to go?

02:36.637 --> 02:37.972
Not yet. He's having fun!

02:38.006 --> 02:39.241
Let him stay a bit.

02:39.274 --> 02:41.677
- Whatcha got there? Huh?
- It's just a quiz.

02:41.709 --> 02:42.977
Oh!

02:43.011 --> 02:45.313
"Are you financially ready
to start a family?"

02:45.338 --> 02:47.575
I <i> love</i> these quizzes!

02:48.983 --> 02:51.352
Did you know
I'm a woman other women hate?

02:53.321 --> 02:55.123
I know it's just a dumb magazine quiz,

02:55.155 --> 02:57.859
but I'm really stressed about
being able to afford a baby.

02:57.893 --> 03:00.140
Do you have six months
of emergency savings?

03:00.165 --> 03:02.363
Who has that?

03:02.397 --> 03:04.766
I'm a single working mom.

03:04.798 --> 03:07.535
I'm gonna need day care,
I'm gonna need insurance,

03:07.569 --> 03:09.871
I'm gonna need baby furniture.

03:09.905 --> 03:11.673
That's not counting unexpected things.

03:11.706 --> 03:13.805
- Like what?
- I don't know. They're unexpected!

03:15.309 --> 03:16.711
Look, I did the whole quiz.

03:16.744 --> 03:18.946
I am completely financially unprepared

03:18.980 --> 03:20.516
to have a baby... I'm screwed.

03:20.548 --> 03:22.016
Look how much money you're saving

03:22.049 --> 03:23.886
by not drinking while you're pregnant.

03:23.918 --> 03:25.153
What's that?

03:25.185 --> 03:30.124
You know, 600, 700 bucks a month.

03:30.158 --> 03:32.793
Is that really
how much you think I drink?

03:32.827 --> 03:34.463
That is so hurtful.

03:34.495 --> 03:37.165
That's like $20 a day.

03:37.197 --> 03:39.171
Huh, it might be that much.

03:40.624 --> 03:41.702
Maybe more.

03:41.728 --> 03:43.382
Yeah, I'm just saying.

03:43.407 --> 03:45.207
You know, you're doing really good
not drinking for the baby.

03:45.239 --> 03:46.404
How many days has it been?

03:46.429 --> 03:49.840
21 brutal days.

03:49.865 --> 03:52.214
But, you know, working at a bar
and serving drinks all day

03:52.246 --> 03:53.582
really keeps my mind off it.

03:55.517 --> 03:57.752
The ketchups are married.

03:57.785 --> 04:00.087
Oh, somebody wrote "Aunt Becky sucks"

04:00.120 --> 04:02.156
on the wall back there.

04:02.190 --> 04:04.560
Could've been anybody.

04:04.593 --> 04:05.560
- See you later.
- Bye, Aunt Becky.

04:07.127 --> 04:08.996
Oh, Andrea!

04:09.030 --> 04:10.933
- Jackie!
- Hi. I saw you on Facebook.

04:10.965 --> 04:13.267
Congratulations on the baby!

04:13.301 --> 04:15.737
Thank you so much.
That really means a lot.

04:15.769 --> 04:17.204
I'm sorry I had to block you.

04:17.237 --> 04:18.839
Yeah, no, I get it.

04:18.872 --> 04:20.041
I get it.

04:20.065 --> 04:21.517
I'm a woman other women hate.

04:22.309 --> 04:24.501
- Great catching up.
- Yeah.

04:24.837 --> 04:26.915
- Andrea. Hey!
- Hey, Becky.

04:26.948 --> 04:28.450
What are you doing here?

04:28.482 --> 04:29.684
Oh, well, I saw your Instagram post

04:29.718 --> 04:31.052
about the drink of the month.

04:31.085 --> 04:32.920
Candy-cane margarita sounded fantastic,

04:32.953 --> 04:34.189
so I came down.

04:34.222 --> 04:35.857
It's really just a regular margarita

04:35.890 --> 04:37.864
with a little crushed-up Altoid in it.

04:40.595 --> 04:42.393
Come on, you didn't
come all the way here

04:42.418 --> 04:44.432
- just for a drink.
- Truth?

04:44.465 --> 04:45.800
I wanted to talk to you.

04:45.833 --> 04:47.768
Why me?

04:47.802 --> 04:49.470
When we were going through
the surrogacy together,

04:49.504 --> 04:50.571
I always felt like I could talk to you

04:50.605 --> 04:51.739
and you wouldn't judge me.

04:51.773 --> 04:53.975
Well, not to your face. That's not cool.

04:56.011 --> 04:58.614
So what's wrong?

04:58.646 --> 04:59.714
Remember how bad I wanted a baby?

04:59.747 --> 05:01.283
Yeah.

05:01.316 --> 05:03.819
I can't find that feeling anymore.

05:03.852 --> 05:06.955
I'm really struggling with being a mom.

05:06.987 --> 05:08.790
But look how cute he is.

05:08.823 --> 05:11.660
Yeah, it's 'cause he's sleeping.

05:11.693 --> 05:13.829
I never realized
how selfish babies can be.

05:13.862 --> 05:16.732
I mean, they never leave you alone.

05:16.765 --> 05:18.634
How hard is it to get away from a baby?

05:18.667 --> 05:20.102
You just put it down and walk away.

05:20.134 --> 05:23.070
The baby's not gonna find you.

05:23.104 --> 05:25.607
I'm sorry. It's just
really been a rough day.

05:25.640 --> 05:27.476
But you have money.

05:27.508 --> 05:28.776
Don't you have nannies and stuff?

05:28.809 --> 05:31.145
Yeah, I have nannies,
I have a diaper service,

05:31.179 --> 05:33.948
I have food delivery, and it's
still virtually impossible.

05:33.982 --> 05:36.051
I mean, I have no idea
how poor people do it.

05:38.018 --> 05:40.422
Wow. So you really regret having a baby?

05:40.455 --> 05:43.325
You have no idea how
lucky you are that you can't.

05:43.357 --> 05:44.727
Oh, yeah. Boy, am I lucky.

05:46.126 --> 05:48.030
Mnh! Oh, my God.

05:48.062 --> 05:49.363
Oh. What am I doing?

05:49.396 --> 05:50.998
It's the Altoid. It's weird, right?

05:51.032 --> 05:52.668
No.

05:52.701 --> 05:54.475
No, it's not that.

05:56.136 --> 05:58.139
I might as well tell you.

05:58.172 --> 05:59.374
I'm pregnant.

06:02.309 --> 06:03.711
You are gonna...

06:03.744 --> 06:05.980
love being a mom!

<i>"The Conners" is recorded</i>

06:46.955 --> 06:48.423
<i>in front of a live studio audience.</i>

06:48.456 --> 06:51.693
So, I just got bored of being retired.

06:51.725 --> 06:53.194
I was gonna travel,

06:53.227 --> 06:54.862
but turns out I'm frightened

06:54.895 --> 06:56.465
of people different than me.

06:59.367 --> 07:00.936
So, maybe stick to the Cracker Barrel

07:00.968 --> 07:02.236
and you'll be fine.

07:05.939 --> 07:06.941
Here you go.

07:09.277 --> 07:10.445
Oops.

07:10.477 --> 07:12.280
- Dropped your tip.
- Nice try.

07:12.312 --> 07:15.015
I'm not bending down
so you can look at my ass again.

07:15.049 --> 07:16.918
Didn't mean to insult you.

07:16.951 --> 07:18.854
How about...

07:18.886 --> 07:21.456
for a $10?

07:23.424 --> 07:25.160
Wow. Thank you.

07:35.636 --> 07:36.737
What a jerk!

07:36.770 --> 07:39.107
He tried to make me bend down for $10.

07:39.140 --> 07:41.777
Management won't do anything
'cause he's a high roller.

07:41.809 --> 07:44.578
Here's how I deal with creepy guys.

07:44.628 --> 07:48.071
I say, "Show me yours,
and I'll show you mine."

07:49.602 --> 07:51.719
Most of the time, it works,

07:51.753 --> 07:54.344
but the rest of the time,
it's pretty gross.

07:57.025 --> 07:58.393
Hey, guys.

07:58.425 --> 08:00.094
Do you mind if I sit down?

08:00.128 --> 08:02.164
I had kind of a crazy day.

08:02.972 --> 08:05.442
What can I get you?

08:05.477 --> 08:08.470
Actually, we wanted
to talk to you first.

08:08.503 --> 08:09.938
If either of you had a bad reaction

08:09.970 --> 08:11.472
to the chiles rellenos last night,

08:11.506 --> 08:12.674
I have a form for you to fill out.

08:12.706 --> 08:15.442
No. It's not that.

08:15.475 --> 08:18.579
Um, look, we know that you're worried

08:18.612 --> 08:20.749
about raising this baby alone,

08:20.782 --> 08:23.652
and you know that
we've been looking to adopt.

08:23.684 --> 08:26.420
So what would you think about

08:26.453 --> 08:28.422
maybe all of us doing this together?

08:28.456 --> 08:30.025
What do you mean?

08:30.057 --> 08:33.260
We'd adopt your baby,
and we'd all raise it.

08:33.293 --> 08:34.328
I mean, the baby would live with us,

08:34.361 --> 08:35.763
but you'd be over all the time,

08:35.797 --> 08:37.999
and we'd pay all the expenses.

08:38.032 --> 08:39.633
Wow.

08:39.667 --> 08:41.302
I did not see this coming.

08:43.571 --> 08:44.873
We know you have to work,

08:44.906 --> 08:46.675
and I work out of the house,

08:46.707 --> 08:48.008
so I could be with the baby all day,

08:48.042 --> 08:50.512
and Bridget has great benefits.

08:50.544 --> 08:51.546
Post office.

08:53.413 --> 08:55.783
This is a lot.

08:55.816 --> 08:58.452
Just need some time to think.

08:58.485 --> 09:00.087
I'll be right back with your food.

09:01.321 --> 09:03.792
We didn't order.

09:03.825 --> 09:05.893
Just eat whatever she brings you.

09:05.927 --> 09:07.396
We're trying to get a baby.

09:13.507 --> 09:15.592
Good morning, Dad.

09:15.663 --> 09:16.765
Is it?

09:18.050 --> 09:20.186
That would indicate that I've slept.

09:20.266 --> 09:23.069
I've been up all night,
like many accomplished men,

09:23.107 --> 09:25.857
knocking cats off
my chicken coop with a broom.

09:27.112 --> 09:29.280
I can't believe
we built a coop for chickens.

09:29.313 --> 09:31.155
I mean, I could never even
get a tree house.

09:31.180 --> 09:33.149
You broke your wrist
walking across a room.

09:33.181 --> 09:35.507
We weren't gonna put you in a tree.

09:35.532 --> 09:37.304
Cornflakes has an STD!

09:38.755 --> 09:42.305
No, honey, the vet said she has PTSD.

09:43.191 --> 09:44.393
According to the vet,

09:44.426 --> 09:47.162
Cornflakes was traumatized
by the cat attack.

09:47.195 --> 09:49.733
We can expect loss of appetite,
irritability,

09:49.766 --> 09:52.536
possibly night terrors.

09:52.569 --> 09:53.536
Okay, Mark.

09:53.569 --> 09:55.338
Take Cornflakes out to the coop.

09:55.371 --> 09:57.674
Well, actually,
until Cornflakes stabilizes,

09:57.707 --> 09:58.842
she needs to live in the house,

09:58.875 --> 10:00.410
and she also has a tranquilizer

10:00.443 --> 10:02.379
she needs to take every four hours.

10:02.411 --> 10:04.814
The doctor recommends that
we take turns holding her

10:04.847 --> 10:07.350
until she falls asleep.

10:07.382 --> 10:10.319
The chicken is not
living in the house with us.

10:10.353 --> 10:12.155
I never thought I'd have to say that.

10:12.188 --> 10:13.256
Come on, guys.

10:13.289 --> 10:15.192
Let's put Cornflakes back in the coop.

10:19.628 --> 10:21.664
This is insane!

10:21.698 --> 10:23.934
My back is killing me
because I've been up all night

10:23.967 --> 10:25.569
dealing with kamikaze cats

10:25.602 --> 10:27.704
hurling themselves at a chicken coop

10:27.737 --> 10:29.271
in my backyard!

10:29.305 --> 10:31.373
Next time you have a harebrained idea,

10:31.406 --> 10:32.608
do it at your house.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.246
Big man, king of England,

10:36.279 --> 10:38.363
too good to have a chicken
living in his house.

10:38.388 --> 10:40.591
Well, la-di-da!

10:43.652 --> 10:45.854
Did you finish laying out
those ads for the next issue?

10:45.887 --> 10:47.690
Just about.

10:47.723 --> 10:50.060
I'm just looking for
another way to make some money.

10:50.093 --> 10:51.895
I'm getting real tired
of this one customer

10:51.928 --> 10:53.862
at the casino harassing me.

10:53.896 --> 10:55.632
What, is he touching you?

10:55.665 --> 10:56.900
Oh, no.

10:56.933 --> 10:59.235
I mean, not yet, anyway.

10:59.267 --> 11:01.271
I'll tell you what,
if he does... come here.

11:01.304 --> 11:03.473
Let me show you a move that'll
really cripple the guy.

11:04.741 --> 11:06.042
Put your hand on my shoulder.

11:06.074 --> 11:07.911
- Okay.
- All right, like that.

11:07.944 --> 11:10.079
And you're gonna put your hand
on top of his hand,

11:10.112 --> 11:12.242
thumb on his knuckles, right?

11:16.352 --> 11:17.821
You know, I think I got a better way.

11:17.853 --> 11:19.723
Better way is good, yeah.

11:19.756 --> 11:20.991
All right.

11:21.024 --> 11:22.225
Look, with guys,

11:22.257 --> 11:24.127
it's all about intimidation, right?

11:24.160 --> 11:26.295
You just got to have that
crazy look in your eyes

11:26.329 --> 11:28.356
that says, "I won't stop
until you're dead,

11:28.381 --> 11:30.178
and then I'll kill your ghost!"

11:31.867 --> 11:33.404
Now, show me your look.

11:37.607 --> 11:39.976
It's not just eyes. This is...

11:40.008 --> 11:41.911
primal animal stuff, you know?

11:41.944 --> 11:43.916
- You just gotta make 'em feel threatened!
- Holy crap!

11:43.941 --> 11:46.682
- That was terrifying.
- Hey, thank you.

11:46.707 --> 11:49.059
Okay, now you go.

11:49.452 --> 11:51.723
Okay. Um...

11:52.021 --> 11:54.024
Raah!

11:54.056 --> 11:55.758
It's... It's a good start.

11:55.791 --> 11:57.343
It's not frightening,

11:57.406 --> 11:59.234
but, um... odd,

11:59.366 --> 12:02.484
and, uh, unsettling.

12:02.564 --> 12:04.631
Let's finish this later.
We need to get back to work.

12:04.656 --> 12:05.758
Whoa. Hey.

12:05.792 --> 12:07.393
Hey!

12:07.425 --> 12:08.594
Better! Yes!

12:08.627 --> 12:12.297
Now it's jarring and off-putting.

12:12.331 --> 12:14.534
Damn straight it is.

12:29.273 --> 12:31.376
Becky, it's late. You okay?

12:32.513 --> 12:34.575
I've just been walking around
the last two hours,

12:34.614 --> 12:37.184
and I think I've made a decision.

12:38.294 --> 12:39.325
I want to do that thing

12:39.357 --> 12:41.593
where I raise the baby with you guys.

12:41.626 --> 12:43.328
Really?

12:43.361 --> 12:45.832
Oh, my God.

12:45.865 --> 12:46.933
Maria!

12:46.966 --> 12:48.301
Come down here!

12:48.333 --> 12:50.602
We're getting a baby!

12:50.635 --> 12:52.237
What?!

12:52.270 --> 12:53.635
Hold on.

12:55.174 --> 12:56.909
We're getting Becky's baby.

12:59.477 --> 13:02.314
She's happy.

13:02.347 --> 13:04.150
Do you want to come in and celebrate?

13:04.183 --> 13:05.570
I think I got some sparkling cider.

13:05.595 --> 13:07.731
Nah, I should get going.

13:07.798 --> 13:09.532
We can talk later.

13:11.761 --> 13:13.530
It's gonna be awesome.

13:13.563 --> 13:15.947
Yeah, it is. Thank you so much.

13:19.955 --> 13:21.122
Goodnight.

13:21.156 --> 13:22.838
Goodnight.

13:41.850 --> 13:43.041
- Darlene!
- What?!

13:43.074 --> 13:46.011
Oh, God.

13:46.044 --> 13:47.880
What are you doing here?
What time is it?

13:47.912 --> 13:49.681
It's 2:00 in the morning.

13:49.714 --> 13:51.016
I just did something,

13:51.049 --> 13:53.052
and I need to talk to you about it.

13:53.084 --> 13:55.819
- Can it wait?
- It could.

13:55.853 --> 13:57.189
But I just agreed to give my baby

13:57.222 --> 13:59.391
to a lesbian couple from the restaurant.

14:00.977 --> 14:04.415
Well, now you've got me hooked. Go on.

14:04.440 --> 14:06.998
You remember Bridget and Maria
from high school?

14:07.031 --> 14:08.871
Yeah.

14:08.896 --> 14:10.297
They offered me this arrangement

14:10.331 --> 14:13.768
where they said we could
all raise the baby together,

14:13.800 --> 14:16.337
but they would actually adopt it.

14:16.370 --> 14:17.872
Becky, why would you do that?

14:17.905 --> 14:19.707
Why wouldn't you come to me first?

14:19.741 --> 14:21.876
Because I'm freaked out.

14:21.909 --> 14:24.945
I think that I'm gonna suck as a mom.

14:24.979 --> 14:26.314
And I was talking to Andrea,

14:26.346 --> 14:28.283
and she has all the help in the world,

14:28.316 --> 14:29.718
and she's falling apart.

14:29.750 --> 14:31.653
But you're not Andrea.

14:31.686 --> 14:33.721
Before the baby,
she had a pretty good life.

14:33.755 --> 14:34.822
You don't have that problem.

14:34.856 --> 14:36.758
You've already fallen apart.

14:39.526 --> 14:41.328
You don't get it.

14:41.361 --> 14:42.731
Well, look.

14:42.764 --> 14:45.000
Becky, I know
you're worried about money,

14:45.033 --> 14:47.635
but m-maybe we'll just figure out a way

14:47.668 --> 14:48.736
to get you some assistance.

14:48.769 --> 14:50.539
It's not just about that.

14:50.572 --> 14:53.475
Then what is it about?

14:53.508 --> 14:55.677
Ever since I've been pregnant,

14:55.710 --> 14:58.614
I can't stop thinking
about having a drink.

15:01.048 --> 15:04.519
I'm a drunk, Darlene.

15:04.552 --> 15:06.136
And...

15:06.254 --> 15:09.316
I don't want to
screw up some kid's life.

15:12.793 --> 15:15.529
I-I'm sorry. This is a lot to take in.

15:15.563 --> 15:16.865
Um...

15:16.898 --> 15:18.433
I think I need some coffee.

15:18.466 --> 15:20.268
I was in the middle of a crazy dream.

15:20.300 --> 15:21.902
Everybody in the family was happy,

15:21.936 --> 15:24.706
and Dad had the head of a chicken.

15:27.537 --> 15:30.111
Okay, I don't think I understand.

15:30.144 --> 15:31.712
I mean, I know you're struggling,

15:31.745 --> 15:33.515
but you're stronger
than you think you are.

15:33.548 --> 15:35.250
I mean, you stopped drinking on a dime

15:35.283 --> 15:37.686
when you found out you were pregnant.

15:37.718 --> 15:41.244
Yesterday, I almost drank
a candy-cane margarita.

15:42.789 --> 15:44.291
God, you must be an alcoholic.

15:44.324 --> 15:47.227
Who else would drink that?

15:47.260 --> 15:49.764
See? That's what I mean.

15:49.797 --> 15:51.733
How could I be a good mother?

15:51.765 --> 15:52.800
I don't want my kid taken away

15:52.833 --> 15:55.569
and turned over to family services.

15:55.602 --> 15:57.304
Okay, I don't think that's gonna happen.

15:57.337 --> 15:59.774
I believe you're gonna stay sober.

15:59.807 --> 16:01.409
But, I mean, I don't want
to be stupid about this.

16:01.442 --> 16:03.544
I know there are some people who can't.

16:03.577 --> 16:05.914
So, if you're one of those people,

16:05.947 --> 16:08.817
then I'll have to step in
and take care of your baby

16:08.850 --> 16:10.250
until you get your act together.

16:10.284 --> 16:12.319
What if I can't get my act together?

16:12.352 --> 16:13.420
Then we sell it.

16:13.453 --> 16:15.723
I mean...

16:15.756 --> 16:17.992
Emilio's a good-looking guy.
You're pretty cute.

16:18.025 --> 16:19.897
I think we can get top dollar.

16:21.261 --> 16:23.664
I can't do this.

16:23.697 --> 16:25.265
You already have too much on your plate.

16:25.298 --> 16:27.601
Well, then we'll get
the whole family to help out.

16:27.635 --> 16:28.736
Becky, we're not gonna let

16:28.769 --> 16:31.005
your baby fall through the cracks.

16:31.039 --> 16:32.872
Oh, my God, what if I start doing crack?

16:34.509 --> 16:36.344
Okay, you're just panicking.

16:36.376 --> 16:38.145
You can do this.

16:38.178 --> 16:39.481
You would not have come over here

16:39.514 --> 16:41.327
if you thought
you were doing the right thing.

16:42.423 --> 16:44.011
Okay.

16:45.186 --> 16:48.590
I'm gonna tell them I changed my mind.

16:48.622 --> 16:52.259
I'm gonna keep the baby.

16:52.293 --> 16:54.462
I don't think I've ever
felt this close to you.

16:56.297 --> 16:57.465
Thank you for not being

16:57.497 --> 16:59.967
a judgmental little troll for once.

17:08.076 --> 17:09.644
What are you gonna do with the chickens?

17:09.675 --> 17:11.444
I'm taking Cornflakes home.

17:11.479 --> 17:14.548
The other three are going to
a chicken rescue.

17:14.580 --> 17:16.555
There's a chicken rescue?

17:17.385 --> 17:18.888
Not just chickens.

17:18.914 --> 17:21.955
Parrots, got a couple of hawks.

17:21.989 --> 17:25.894
I heard they had one of
the "Harry Potter" owls, so...

17:25.925 --> 17:28.212
I'm figuring it's a good place.

17:30.364 --> 17:32.834
The chickens could stay.

17:32.866 --> 17:34.868
I just didn't want Cornflakes
in the house.

17:34.902 --> 17:36.571
Why don't you say
what you really mean, Dan?

17:36.604 --> 17:38.239
You just don't want me in the house.

17:38.271 --> 17:39.808
Where are you getting that from?

17:39.840 --> 17:41.208
Let's finally get this out.

17:41.241 --> 17:43.978
The only reason you ever
put up with me coming over

17:44.010 --> 17:47.014
is because my sister wanted me here.

17:47.048 --> 17:49.217
And?

17:49.250 --> 17:50.751
You're so thick-headed.

17:50.777 --> 17:52.906
Why do you think the chickens are here?

17:52.931 --> 17:55.155
I have no damn idea.

17:55.189 --> 17:57.358
Oh, so you want me to say it, don't you?

17:57.391 --> 18:00.894
Okay! I thought if there was
a chicken coop here,

18:00.927 --> 18:02.731
you'd need somebody to help you with it.

18:02.763 --> 18:05.666
That would give me an excuse
to come over every day.

18:05.700 --> 18:07.836
So, you thought if you forced me

18:07.868 --> 18:09.337
to become a chicken farmer,

18:09.369 --> 18:12.407
- I'd want you here more?
- Yeah.

18:12.440 --> 18:13.808
Wasn't a perfect plan.

18:16.243 --> 18:19.079
Listen, Jackie, when Roseanne was alive,

18:19.113 --> 18:21.382
you'd come over,
and I'd give you a hard time.

18:21.414 --> 18:23.784
Now, that worked for 40 years.

18:23.817 --> 18:25.353
I see no reason to change it now.

18:25.385 --> 18:27.454
So, then, why doesn't anybody
ever call me

18:27.488 --> 18:29.257
and invite me over?!

18:29.289 --> 18:33.127
You don't need to be invited
because you're always here!

18:33.161 --> 18:34.618
And why would you need an invite?

18:34.643 --> 18:36.260
You're family.

18:36.329 --> 18:38.299
So...

18:38.398 --> 18:39.933
you want me here,

18:39.967 --> 18:44.038
and if I didn't come over,
you'd miss me?

18:44.070 --> 18:47.741
Yeah, sure. Why not?

18:47.775 --> 18:50.078
There we go... the reluctant compliment.

18:50.110 --> 18:52.520
Dan... our little game continues!

18:52.545 --> 18:53.647
Come here!

18:58.318 --> 19:00.087
Are you still gonna
take Cornflakes home?

19:00.121 --> 19:01.923
Oh, yeah, just for a week.

19:01.955 --> 19:04.591
Mom says she's deathly afraid of birds.

19:04.625 --> 19:07.152
We're gonna find out if that's true,

19:07.177 --> 19:09.427
aren't we, Cornflakes?

19:14.524 --> 19:15.860
Hey.

19:15.914 --> 19:17.498
What are you doing here?

19:17.563 --> 19:19.532
Eh, no reason.

19:19.564 --> 19:21.401
Maybe gamble.

19:21.433 --> 19:23.555
Thought maybe I'd go find that guy

19:23.641 --> 19:25.891
who's been bothering you and say hey.

19:28.268 --> 19:31.071
Punch him till he's unconscious.

19:31.448 --> 19:32.583
Wait.

19:32.615 --> 19:35.152
So, as my boss,

19:35.184 --> 19:38.225
you just decided to
come down here and protect me?

19:38.250 --> 19:41.658
There's no other feelings
motivating this?

19:41.691 --> 19:43.869
What other feelings could I have

19:43.894 --> 19:44.996
that would motivate this?

19:45.018 --> 19:46.553
I don't know. You tell me.

19:46.586 --> 19:49.389
No, you tell <i> me.</i>

19:49.422 --> 19:51.547
Some people might say

19:51.572 --> 19:54.127
it feels like a boyfriend move?

19:54.159 --> 19:55.027
No!

19:55.060 --> 19:56.495
What? No.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.198
What?!

19:58.231 --> 20:00.800
No. That wouldn't be appropriate.

20:00.832 --> 20:03.637
And I think that
you questioning my intentions

20:03.669 --> 20:06.705
is kind of a girlfriend move.

20:06.739 --> 20:07.974
What? No.

20:08.006 --> 20:09.909
What?! No.

20:11.543 --> 20:14.313
Hey.

20:14.347 --> 20:16.349
Thanks for not saying anything
about the outfit.

20:16.381 --> 20:17.416
What outfit?

20:20.852 --> 20:23.022
Here you go.

20:23.056 --> 20:24.357
Tell you what.

20:24.389 --> 20:26.812
Sit on my lap for good luck,

20:26.893 --> 20:28.836
and I'll split my winnings with you.

20:30.929 --> 20:32.532
You know what? I have a better idea.

20:36.214 --> 20:37.816
What the hell?

20:37.904 --> 20:39.239
You know I'm gonna get you fired.

20:39.272 --> 20:40.980
Oh, I'm gonna quit before you do.

20:41.005 --> 20:42.043
I win again!

20:43.810 --> 20:45.878
I just threw a drink
in the creep's face,

20:45.912 --> 20:47.447
and I'm quitting.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.115
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:49.147 --> 20:51.784
And you know what gave me
the courage to do it?

20:51.818 --> 20:53.820
The fact that you're giving me
a raise and medical.

20:55.989 --> 20:57.057
And it's so great

20:57.089 --> 20:58.558
because I didn't think
I could stay sober

20:58.590 --> 21:00.060
after the baby was born,

21:00.092 --> 21:01.860
which is why I agreed to your offer.

21:01.894 --> 21:03.730
But my family really stepped up.

21:03.762 --> 21:06.131
I mean, my sister Darlene...
you know her from school...

21:06.165 --> 21:08.534
she was just so supportive and amazing,

21:08.568 --> 21:09.769
and now I'm feeling so good

21:09.801 --> 21:13.064
because I feel like I can
finally be a responsible mom!

21:13.740 --> 21:15.462
We're very happy for you.

21:17.275 --> 21:19.414
I'm going on break,

21:19.508 --> 21:22.745
so Stephanie is going to
take over my section.

21:22.849 --> 21:24.304
Don't forget to tip!
