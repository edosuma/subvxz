01:31.041 --> 01:32.001
Hello?

02:10.163 --> 02:12.082
Good morning, is your mother in?

02:56.126 --> 02:57.211
Are you ready?

03:01.090 --> 03:02.925
I must go now.

03:12.184 --> 03:15.062
Jesus, the son of God ...

03:15.354 --> 03:19.024
...descended on earth
and suffered ...

03:19.316 --> 03:21.860
...to pay for our sins.

03:52.975 --> 03:54.351
<i>You're in danger.</i>

03:54.643 --> 03:57.563
<i>I do not care,
As long as I am near you.</i>

03:58.772 --> 04:01.692
<i>I never thanked you for your help.</i>

04:01.984 --> 04:04.111
<i>It was brave, very courageous.</i>

04:04.403 --> 04:06.614
<i>I've never seen you
so beautiful.</i>

04:06.947 --> 04:09.575
<i>I think
I am in love with you.</i>

04:11.994 --> 04:14.955
<i>You'll come with me to the police?
No.</i>

04:15.247 --> 04:16.248
<i>Why?</i>

04:17.583 --> 04:20.002
<i>I killed Charles Ringan.</i>

04:20.293 --> 04:22.296
<i>Would you tell the Commissioner?</i>

04:23.297 --> 04:25.007
<i>Yes, if you ask it</i>

04:27.218 --> 04:28.719
<i>I don't want to.</i>

04:29.011 --> 04:32.431
<i>Listen, I'm very tired.
I feel quite stiff.</i>

04:32.723 --> 04:37.102
<i>I killed a man and I witnessed
the murder of a poor soul.</i>

04:37.394 --> 04:40.856
<i>It's all because Geiger
sang Carmen.</i>

04:41.148 --> 04:44.985
<i>If I told, your home
would be invaded by police ...</i>

04:45.277 --> 04:47.905
<i>... before you'd have time to flee.</i>

05:19.311 --> 05:22.690
<i>Perhaps she'll recover. I've seen it in the past.</i>

05:23.023 --> 05:26.735
<i>We'll let your father know about Ringan.</i>

05:27.278 --> 05:28.862
<i>You forgot something.</i>

05:29.863 --> 05:31.073
<i>Me?</i>

05:31.949 --> 05:33.993
<i>What do you have?</i>

05:34.827 --> 05:37.162
<i>Nothing you can't heal</i>

07:15.803 --> 07:18.347
If I extract the bullet,
he'll be a vegetable.

07:18.639 --> 07:22.309
If I don't, he'll be living on
the knife's edge.

07:22.601 --> 07:25.354
Better to be alive
at the risk of dying ...

07:25.646 --> 07:28.357
...then to be dead.

07:28.649 --> 07:31.318
This is closer to philosophy
than medicine.

07:31.569 --> 07:33.445
Heads or Tails?

07:36.699 --> 07:37.616
Heads!

07:37.908 --> 07:41.871
OK, I'll leave it. It'll ring the
alarms at airports!

08:02.725 --> 08:04.351
They changed the lock.

08:04.643 --> 08:08.022
What happened, did you comb hair
with a can opener?

08:08.314 --> 08:09.899
Where's my stuff?

08:10.190 --> 08:12.318
It was in the cellar.
But you know people...

08:12.610 --> 08:16.947
After 3 days, there was not more
than odd socks left

08:24.705 --> 08:25.748
That's my hat.

08:29.460 --> 08:30.377
Hey ...

08:55.486 --> 08:56.820
My little Bazil ...

08:57.112 --> 08:59.323
For you, fell off the back of a truck.

08:59.615 --> 09:00.991
100% cotton.

09:02.034 --> 09:04.787
You got a job
you'll find a home.

09:10.292 --> 09:12.503
Good morning.
Is Serge in?

09:12.795 --> 09:15.756
Well! If it isn't Bazil!
You've come back!

09:16.048 --> 09:17.383
I almost didn't.

09:17.675 --> 09:20.553
I hope they took the lead
from your head.

09:20.844 --> 09:23.138
I'm back, faithful to the position.

09:23.430 --> 09:26.100
But the position was not
faithful to you.

09:26.392 --> 09:27.560
I had to replace you.

09:29.436 --> 09:31.105
This is Lola.

09:31.397 --> 09:32.898
Three-month trial.

09:33.190 --> 09:36.151
We just signed a permanent contract.
Ah ...

09:36.443 --> 09:39.196
Well, we haven't kissed.

09:48.789 --> 09:50.040
Mr. Bazil!

09:50.332 --> 09:52.960
Don't listen to him.
In fact, I have a boyfriend.

09:53.252 --> 09:54.712
His name is Ricardo.

09:55.004 --> 09:58.883
He picks me up every night
on his motorcycle.

09:59.174 --> 10:00.509
He always parks there.

10:01.135 --> 10:03.220
Where you were shot.

10:03.512 --> 10:04.889
One day, while riding...

10:05.723 --> 10:10.477
We heard a small noise,
like a pebble stuck in the tire.

10:13.230 --> 10:15.190
Mr. Bazil, it was not a pebble.

10:16.984 --> 10:18.193
Which hand?

10:21.322 --> 10:22.907
Make an effort.

10:32.750 --> 10:36.754
<i>She puts her head under her feet
and her toes in the nose</i>

10:37.046 --> 10:40.174
<i>And then does the splits.</i>

10:40.466 --> 10:43.844
<i>She spins and
coils like a caterpillar.</i>

10:44.136 --> 10:46.889
<i>Suddenly, her legs around his neck</i>

10:47.181 --> 10:51.810
<i>She spins, like a ball
and nibbles his knees.</i>

10:52.102 --> 10:55.231
<i>The rubber woman.</i>

10:55.522 --> 10:58.692
<i>With her, what fun they can
have. Ah, it's crazy.</i>

10:58.984 --> 11:02.196
<i>It's enough to make you
go funny in the head.</i>

11:02.488 --> 11:06.200
<i>They search below and they
find it underneath.</i>

11:06.575 --> 11:09.662
<i>The rubber woman.</i>

11:10.538 --> 11:11.705
Thank you ...

13:36.016 --> 13:37.309
You got five minutes?

13:41.355 --> 13:43.274
I spent my life in jail.

13:43.566 --> 13:45.276
So they call me "Closet".

13:45.985 --> 13:47.027
I'm Bazil.

13:47.319 --> 13:49.196
I know.
You're a sweet in a jar.

13:50.823 --> 13:54.201
You've been on the streets for 2 months,

13:54.451 --> 13:57.371
but you've not submerged, you have a
purpose. What is it?

13:58.205 --> 13:59.498
I live day to day.

13:59.790 --> 14:02.960
With the bullet,
that could make me trip out anytime.

14:03.669 --> 14:06.589
Me, the widow maker gave me
this injury.

14:06.881 --> 14:09.216
The guillotine in '59.

14:09.508 --> 14:13.262
The guillotine jammed.

14:13.554 --> 14:15.598
It happened twice.
I was pardoned.

14:15.890 --> 14:17.808
Get that bullet out of your head.

14:18.767 --> 14:21.604
Impossible.
The surgeon said ...

14:21.896 --> 14:22.897
Because ...

14:23.856 --> 14:26.901
You follow me.
A family will adopt you.

14:50.758 --> 14:51.592
Hi.

14:51.884 --> 14:53.093
Hi!

14:53.636 --> 14:55.721
That's Max.
Here we're home.

14:56.513 --> 14:59.433
We share our home.
This is our little goose of the Capitol.

14:59.725 --> 15:01.644
If the robber is pointing ...

15:01.936 --> 15:05.689
Whistle blasts

15:05.981 --> 15:08.317
Ha! Ha!
Go, go, my little guy.

15:27.545 --> 15:29.421
Come in, don't be shy.

15:45.312 --> 15:46.397
Wakey

15:46.689 --> 15:48.023
Come, let me introduce...

15:49.066 --> 15:52.111
For recruitment,
it is she who decides.

15:52.403 --> 15:55.322
You collect stray bullets?
Yes, ma'am.

15:55.656 --> 15:56.740
Say!

15:57.199 --> 15:58.784
I'm Tambouille.

15:59.076 --> 16:02.246
Here stuff is recovered,
we sort and repair it.

16:02.538 --> 16:04.290
Everybody together.

16:04.582 --> 16:06.041
Even little Pierre.

16:06.584 --> 16:09.587
And, he's an artist.

16:17.428 --> 16:20.681
He brings anything we can use.

17:00.304 --> 17:01.430
59...

17:01.722 --> 17:02.973
42 ...

17:03.641 --> 17:04.934
104!

17:07.728 --> 17:08.854
Nickel.

17:09.146 --> 17:12.523
She's called "Calculator".
Father and mother unknown.

17:12.816 --> 17:15.069
He has a compass in his eye.

17:15.361 --> 17:18.196
The white man
a compass in the eye

17:18.489 --> 17:21.575
...starvation
begins at the top...

17:21.909 --> 17:23.911
...and goes from cock to the ass.
Yes!

17:24.244 --> 17:26.121
"The compass in the eye".
Note.

17:26.413 --> 17:28.916
He was a writer in Brazil.

17:29.208 --> 17:31.168
Fracasso is my name.

17:31.460 --> 17:32.878
I have carbon staples...

17:33.170 --> 17:34.547
...in my throat.

17:34.838 --> 17:38.676
He lost a lung in a water bottle
explosion.

17:38.968 --> 17:42.513
and also have a cycle Dynamo
in my stomach ...

17:42.805 --> 17:45.099
...and 3 neck joints
of titanium.

17:45.391 --> 17:49.186
Well, go ahead, tap away.
Go ahead, it's titanium!

17:49.478 --> 17:50.437
Go!
Go ahead!

17:51.272 --> 17:52.189
Oh!

17:52.439 --> 17:55.109
He dreams of getting his name
in the Guinness Book of Records.

17:55.359 --> 17:59.029
I already did in 77!
212 meters: Record of the human cannonball.

17:59.321 --> 18:01.365
We never saw
the certificate.

18:01.657 --> 18:03.742
I was robbed!
I've told you already.

18:05.244 --> 18:07.621
Hey, you!
Why do you get him upset?

18:17.882 --> 18:20.759
Now that you belong to the
Family ...

18:21.051 --> 18:25.556
...get me
a small pot of cream in the fridge.

18:38.861 --> 18:40.446
Further down, boy!

18:43.324 --> 18:43.991
Aaaahh!

18:51.415 --> 18:52.541
You want my picture?

18:52.833 --> 18:54.835
She's a little snappish...

18:55.127 --> 18:59.048
...but she's always the first
to bend for for others.

18:59.340 --> 19:02.843
You're a contortionist?
No, I am the vegetable crisper.

19:03.135 --> 19:04.678
She was like that from birth...

19:05.429 --> 19:08.641
At 5, she already was hiding
in the pantry.

19:08.933 --> 19:11.352
And he remained so long
the closet ...

19:11.644 --> 19:15.397
...without laces in his shoes
that he's forgot how to tie them!

19:18.234 --> 19:19.109
Come!

19:19.401 --> 19:21.904
Come to the table, the mash is ready.

19:37.044 --> 19:38.879
<i>Speaking a Flemish dialect.</i>

22:14.201 --> 22:15.870
Can I help you?

22:16.203 --> 22:19.206
Yes, I would like to see
Mr. De Fenouillet.

22:19.498 --> 22:21.292
Of course,
you have an appointment?

22:21.542 --> 22:24.211
That is to say,
I have something in mind.

22:24.503 --> 22:25.713
It concerns him.

22:26.005 --> 22:29.466
If this is a project or idea,
send an email.

22:29.758 --> 22:34.096
I could send him a scan,
but I prefer to see him.

22:34.388 --> 22:36.056
You'll have to leave.

22:36.348 --> 22:37.308
Yes. Warning!

22:37.600 --> 22:38.350
Warning!

22:38.642 --> 22:40.769
Warning! Warning!

22:51.155 --> 22:51.906
Boo!

22:52.198 --> 22:54.992
Show this clown to the street,
that's all.

22:56.035 --> 22:57.703
A bullet in the head?

22:57.995 --> 23:00.331
At least he'll remember us!

23:27.691 --> 23:30.152
Guys, I need someone here!
Go!

23:46.794 --> 23:49.463
<i>You know
we're leaders ...</i>

23:49.713 --> 23:52.550
<i>... in the field of
cluster munitions.</i>

23:52.841 --> 23:56.262
<i>We have quadrupled our sales
in the Gulf ...</i>

23:56.971 --> 24:00.558
<i>... decreased by 7 to 9%
on collateral damage.</i>

24:01.559 --> 24:04.603
<i>As you know,
we're not monsters.</i>

24:04.895 --> 24:07.147
<i>We don't want anyone's death.</i>

24:07.439 --> 24:09.024
<i>We all know very well ...</i>

24:09.316 --> 24:12.862
<i>... a wounded soldier is more expensive
than a dead soldier!</i>

24:13.153 --> 24:17.908
<i>Our CBS-87
disperses 202 projectiles ...</i>

24:18.200 --> 24:21.203
<i>... and cleans the equivalent
of 4 football fields.</i>

24:21.495 --> 24:24.665
<i>We have been present
in the Gulf, Kosovo. ..</i>

24:25.749 --> 24:28.878
<i>... in Afghanistan ...
In short, it is time to call ...</i>

24:29.169 --> 24:32.464
<i>... to this forum
the architect of our success.</i>

24:32.756 --> 24:35.551
<i>Our CEO:
FranÃ§ois Marconi!</i>

24:39.722 --> 24:42.182
<i>Thank you, thank you.
Thank you all.</i>

24:47.605 --> 24:49.565
<i>Tracers ...</i>

24:50.065 --> 24:52.860
<i>... explosive or bullets ...</i>

24:53.152 --> 24:55.321
<i>... ours are the best ...</i>

24:55.613 --> 24:58.115
<i>... the most aggressive and powerful.</i>

25:02.036 --> 25:05.331
<i>Rimbaud began as a poet
Finally as an arms dealer.</i>

25:05.623 --> 25:08.167
<i>Well, I...
I'll do the opposite.</i>

25:08.459 --> 25:10.669
<i>But until retirement ...</i>

25:11.212 --> 25:14.882
<i>... I will continue to rhyme
ambition with ammunition...</i>

25:15.174 --> 25:17.343
<i>... Living with dynamite.</i>

25:17.635 --> 25:20.763
<i>Love live Vigilatne Armament!</i>

25:39.114 --> 25:40.824
Goodnight, Mr. President.

25:41.909 --> 25:43.577
General...

25:43.869 --> 25:45.829
Joseph, good night!

26:27.079 --> 26:28.581
I remind you...

26:28.873 --> 26:30.583
...of the new rule in force.

26:30.875 --> 26:34.545
A landmine
was placed under the playing surface

26:34.795 --> 26:37.172
Yes, it is a renewed challenge ...

26:37.464 --> 26:38.883
...offered by the league.

26:41.802 --> 26:45.681
The suspense was short-lived
as frontcenter ...

26:45.973 --> 26:49.643
...the visiting team
just paid the price.

27:00.196 --> 27:03.574
You were brilliant tonight.
- Thanks, George.

27:04.783 --> 27:07.912
Arthur Rimbaud arms dealer,
in history?

27:08.204 --> 27:12.082
Yes, but it didn't prevent him from dying
of gangrene, when they amputated of his leg.

27:14.251 --> 27:16.003
Baudelaire, of syphilis?

27:16.295 --> 27:17.546
Verlaine, delirium tremens ...

27:17.838 --> 27:19.715
...Lorca was shot ...

27:20.007 --> 27:22.009
...Nerval hanged himself from a
lamppost.

27:22.301 --> 27:25.971
I will encourage my son to
become a poet, sir.

27:36.690 --> 27:39.568
Tomorrow,
wake me up at 10am

27:40.945 --> 27:41.987
Yes, sir.

27:44.698 --> 27:47.368
You've worked for us
long?

27:48.619 --> 27:49.828
30 years next month.

27:50.412 --> 27:51.413
Ah ...

27:52.289 --> 27:53.332
Why don't we...

27:53.624 --> 27:56.835
...upgrade this place for your 30 years?

27:57.127 --> 27:59.463
With some high-tech equipment.

28:00.798 --> 28:04.468
The old pots make the best soups.

28:05.135 --> 28:06.262
Hum ...

28:07.054 --> 28:08.138
Change is coming.

28:09.682 --> 28:11.809
At least once
every 30 years.

30:20.062 --> 30:22.314
Why can't he sleep at the foot
of the bed?

30:22.606 --> 30:24.024
Stop moaning!

30:24.316 --> 30:26.026
Birds of a feather flock together.

30:26.318 --> 30:28.362
<i>Hey, Grandma?
Croutons!</i>

30:33.492 --> 30:36.370
<i>Cello and musical saw</i>

30:36.662 --> 30:45.170
...

30:56.724 --> 30:58.517
The day went well?

30:58.851 --> 31:01.270
Yes, papa.
I was brilliant tonight.

31:01.562 --> 31:05.357
My speech was fantastic.
I was compared to Rimbaud.

31:05.649 --> 31:06.775
You know who he is?

31:07.067 --> 31:08.611
Yes, but you're not that muscula.

31:11.238 --> 31:13.741
No, not "Rambo", darling, "Rimbaud."

31:16.452 --> 31:18.287
Put him to bed.

31:18.579 --> 31:19.663
Yes, sir.

32:44.206 --> 32:46.250
<i>Hello? Yes.</i>

32:46.542 --> 32:49.795
<i>No, wait ...
How did you get this number?</i>

32:50.087 --> 32:51.213
Yes, I see.

32:51.505 --> 32:55.342
No, this kind of transaction,
not over the phone.

32:55.676 --> 32:57.636
No! No more ...

32:57.928 --> 32:59.680
I prefer a public place.

32:59.972 --> 33:01.807
I know ... Say Wednesday ...

33:02.099 --> 33:04.643
<i>... 3pm, the sports dept. of
Galeries Lafayette.</i>

33:05.269 --> 33:06.395
Yes, that's it.

33:18.991 --> 33:19.950
Waffles ...

33:20.242 --> 33:21.160
...d'Brussels!

33:21.452 --> 33:23.078
Cries of joy

33:23.370 --> 33:26.582
Do not eat too much,
I put the rum in the batter.

33:26.874 --> 33:28.125
Hey, stop!

33:28.417 --> 33:31.629
<i>Speaking in Flemish dialect</i>

33:38.928 --> 33:41.680
<i>She speaks Chinese</i>

33:45.059 --> 33:48.395
Hurry, the minots!
They'll be ready soon!

33:48.687 --> 33:50.105
Mr. Fracasse...

33:50.814 --> 33:53.776
Isn't this you, here
in the Guinness Book of Records?

33:54.068 --> 33:55.361
Yikes!

33:56.612 --> 33:58.113
The 77!

34:00.991 --> 34:02.660
What did I tell you!

34:02.952 --> 34:05.996
What I tell you ...
Ha! Ha!

34:07.873 --> 34:10.876
"On July 14, 1977,
Theodore Henri de Montreuil"...

34:11.168 --> 34:13.128
Who is Theodore Henry?

34:13.754 --> 34:15.380
..."beat by 9 meters ...

34:15.672 --> 34:19.927
..."the record of human-cannonball
prepared by Mr. grampee on 66" Ha!

34:20.219 --> 34:24.056
"Beat by 9 meters"!

34:28.936 --> 34:29.770
Yes!

34:33.649 --> 34:35.359
You'll give it to me, kid.
Oh no.

34:35.650 --> 34:37.152
Ah yes, please, if you give me.

34:37.444 --> 34:39.905
But no.
If you give me.

34:40.197 --> 34:42.283
You sign my t-shirt, then.

34:46.704 --> 34:47.788
"T. Henri" ...

34:48.080 --> 34:49.540
Thierry Henry.

34:49.831 --> 34:52.167
Fracasso, I have a job for you.

34:52.458 --> 34:54.420
I'm not joking...

34:54.712 --> 34:57.214
...but I think
there's a catch.

34:57.506 --> 34:59.800
You've got an idea
in that head?

35:00.843 --> 35:03.470
Mister poses a mystery.

35:03.721 --> 35:06.515
Well, who cares, you're not curious.

35:17.735 --> 35:19.361
Oh ... Oh!

35:26.327 --> 35:27.328
What time?

35:27.620 --> 35:31.207
Tomorrow, 10am,
opposite the tomb of Sacha Guitry.

35:55.147 --> 35:56.315
Mr. Marconi?

35:57.483 --> 35:59.818
I am the messenger of
Omar Boulounga.

36:00.569 --> 36:03.072
Omar Boulounga ...
The former dictator ...?

36:03.364 --> 36:07.409
The former and the next.
He's preparing a revolution.

36:08.494 --> 36:10.037
I don't have a polical view.

36:10.329 --> 36:14.041
We require rifles,
grenades and mines.

36:14.333 --> 36:17.920
And the DGA, the Export Committee
the Ottawa Treaty?

36:18.212 --> 36:20.172
You have all the weapons
In stock.

36:20.464 --> 36:23.342
You don't have an export sector
in Zamibia.

36:23.634 --> 36:25.469
We'd like one.

36:25.761 --> 36:29.181
And this should interest me?
Check us out.

36:29.515 --> 36:34.562
We'll give you double the cash and
more in diamonds if we succeed.

36:34.854 --> 36:35.813
Continue.

36:36.105 --> 36:37.982
Mr. Boulounga's national account...

36:38.274 --> 36:39.775
...the diamond mines.

36:40.067 --> 36:43.153
Don't sneeze!
Think of something, fast!

36:43.445 --> 36:47.449
Zebras are white with black stripes
or black with white stripes?

36:47.741 --> 36:48.826
Oh, pygmies!

36:49.159 --> 36:52.037
Are there dwarves among pygmies?

36:52.329 --> 36:54.331
Why we say "CIA"
and not "ifeow"?

36:54.623 --> 36:57.251
Or "f-bi-ouch" and not "FBI?

36:57.543 --> 36:58.586
Think ...

36:58.878 --> 37:01.922
...but do not delay too much,
we returned to Conakry Monday.

37:28.199 --> 37:29.116
You!

37:30.743 --> 37:31.869
Yes, you!

37:32.161 --> 37:34.371
I do not know what your shenanigans
are about...

37:34.622 --> 37:38.125
...but either you go and continue
doing everything alone ...

37:38.417 --> 37:41.295
...or you stay
and ask us for help.

37:41.587 --> 37:43.255
Am I clear?

37:43.547 --> 37:45.507
Some of them want to help me?

37:45.799 --> 37:46.842
What?

37:48.010 --> 37:52.223
I found the manufacturer of the bullet
and the mine that killed my father.

37:52.514 --> 37:56.810
I need to do two things at once
I can't do it alone.

38:02.274 --> 38:03.943
Stick together ...

38:11.909 --> 38:13.869
They're the watchmen.

38:14.161 --> 38:16.789
Inside is the dealer.

38:17.039 --> 38:20.000
The drug's hidden in the mailbox.

38:20.292 --> 38:22.586
That way, if they're ever searched...

38:22.878 --> 38:25.297
...they are white as snow.
Let's go!

38:36.058 --> 38:40.646
You've already done it for the crash
and whiplash at the same time?

38:40.938 --> 38:42.189
You're old school.

38:47.611 --> 38:48.529
Yes?

38:48.821 --> 38:51.782
Asbestos Control.
A problem was reported.

38:52.032 --> 38:54.285
But there's no asbestos here!

38:55.494 --> 38:58.414
We didn't find asbestos in the
devil vauvert.

38:58.706 --> 38:59.748
From the crack of dawn ...

39:00.040 --> 39:02.418
...we dealt with that problem.

39:02.710 --> 39:05.337
So no need to rock the boat.

39:05.629 --> 39:06.714
Ah!

39:07.298 --> 39:08.799
Oh! But ...

39:09.091 --> 39:11.260
The widow told me she'd
never leave.

39:11.552 --> 39:14.847
Wherever I go, it's on my back.

39:15.139 --> 39:16.181
Hats off!

39:39.663 --> 39:40.706
And my receipt?

39:40.998 --> 39:43.167
The more one drinks,
more one is right!

40:02.228 --> 40:04.855
The boarding hall, please?

40:08.317 --> 40:12.988
My brother, you want a magical necklace?
Get you into heaven.

40:13.280 --> 40:16.492
The powder wards off evil spirits.

40:16.784 --> 40:18.202
But yes! Ha! Ha!

40:18.494 --> 40:20.913
Ah, you're the boss?
Commander!

40:28.087 --> 40:29.088
Here!

40:29.380 --> 40:31.215
It will protect you against the
devil ...

40:31.507 --> 40:32.675
...and the vagaries of fate.

40:32.967 --> 40:35.970
Incense that will allow you
contact the deceased.

40:36.262 --> 40:40.599
Let the passengers be!
I've told you 100 times!

40:40.891 --> 40:42.852
This is your last warning. Get away!

40:43.143 --> 40:47.398
Sorry, gentlemen.
Wishing you a safe journey.

41:04.790 --> 41:06.834
Sorry, if you please,
sir.

41:07.126 --> 41:08.043
Hello.

41:08.335 --> 41:09.962
We're seeking the plane to America.

41:10.254 --> 41:11.797
The departure hall?

41:12.089 --> 41:14.258
Yes, we go to Manhattan
to visit ...

41:14.550 --> 41:15.551
...my son.

41:16.844 --> 41:19.096
You must register your baggage before.

41:19.388 --> 41:20.681
It's half-sister...

41:21.015 --> 41:23.934
...my son who left in 1989
for New York.

41:24.685 --> 41:28.063
New York ...
You're talking to me?

41:28.772 --> 41:30.024
In 1988.

41:30.316 --> 41:31.567
On December 12, 1988.

42:04.808 --> 42:06.936
<i>Last call for Conakry.</i>

42:07.228 --> 42:09.271
<i>Lufthansa Flight 202.</i>

42:14.318 --> 42:16.529
The vertebra of Tino Rossi.

42:18.739 --> 42:21.200
Winston Churchill's
Fingernail clippings.

42:24.453 --> 42:26.121
The molar Marilyn ...

42:27.498 --> 42:28.791
Monroe.

42:31.585 --> 42:34.088
The foot of Salma Lazarus.

42:34.380 --> 42:35.965
Heart of Louis XVI.

42:36.257 --> 42:37.925
The finger of Matisse.

42:39.718 --> 42:41.845
The eye of Mussolini ...

42:42.513 --> 42:45.140
Sniff, ringing
Nothing doing.

42:48.143 --> 42:52.481
It is expected that the DGA launched
the study and called the Saudis.

42:52.773 --> 42:56.652
Yes, it was more an individual effort
than group... rather well done.

42:58.028 --> 43:00.906
Well, they will not provide the
source code.

43:01.824 --> 43:05.619
If it works?
Remember the Sarajevo market.

43:21.468 --> 43:26.390
The collateral damage added value
in the media.

43:36.025 --> 43:37.484
But of course ...

43:42.406 --> 43:44.575
That's why it kills me to say.

43:45.534 --> 43:47.286
You and me, we work ...

43:48.329 --> 43:50.497
...in the defense industry ...

43:50.789 --> 43:52.750
...not in the attack industry.

43:53.042 --> 43:55.252
I beg you, dear friend.

43:55.544 --> 43:57.796
You are always welcome.

43:58.589 --> 43:59.882
My respects to madame.

44:53.143 --> 44:55.563
I'm already 10 minutes late,
hurry!

44:59.733 --> 45:00.901
What was that, Maurice?

45:01.193 --> 45:03.070
"Stephen", sir.
Stephen, yes!

45:03.362 --> 45:06.615
We have a flat, I think.
Sorry, I'll check.

45:09.952 --> 45:11.120
Peasant.

45:32.474 --> 45:33.559
Hello.

45:33.851 --> 45:37.104
I have a reservation
in the name of De Fenouillet.

45:37.396 --> 45:39.523
Yes.
You are expected.

45:45.237 --> 45:47.615
I am the right hand of
Mr. De Fenouillet.

45:47.907 --> 45:51.827
He asked me to tell you that the
eye of Mussolini interests him.

45:52.119 --> 45:56.624
In exchange for Achilles hell and
Adam's apple of...

46:01.795 --> 46:04.965
1, 2, 3 ... test.
1, 2, 3 ... test.

46:05.257 --> 46:08.219
I am the messenger of Omar Boulounga.

46:24.360 --> 46:26.403
Go ahead, make me an offer.

46:26.695 --> 46:29.990
Do not put the cart before
the horse. It will save us...

46:30.241 --> 46:32.701
...from having 2 feet
in the same hoof.

46:34.245 --> 46:36.163
If you have the eye of Mussolini...

46:36.455 --> 46:39.583
...I'll give you the molar of Marilyn.

46:39.875 --> 46:40.834
It's worth it.

46:41.544 --> 46:43.963
I've got the finger of Matisse
and fingernails of Churchill ...

46:44.255 --> 46:47.049
...name the price.
What say you, Mr. Lazarus?

46:48.676 --> 46:51.303
Mr. Lazarus had a setback,
he had to leave.

46:52.471 --> 46:55.432
Unfortunately,
Mr. Lazarus had to stand you up.

46:55.766 --> 46:57.518
He returned to his household.

46:58.060 --> 46:59.144
Who are you?

47:00.771 --> 47:04.149
I am the messenger of Omar Boulounga.

47:05.568 --> 47:06.694
Boulounga?

47:07.570 --> 47:09.822
I thought ...
We were done?

47:10.114 --> 47:11.031
Nay.

47:11.907 --> 47:13.576
A popular revolution...

47:14.702 --> 47:16.620
A popular revolution.

47:16.912 --> 47:19.456
Omar will return where
Omar belongs.

47:20.499 --> 47:22.293
I'm not interested in politics.

47:22.585 --> 47:24.086
It doesn't bring you bread.

47:28.841 --> 47:30.217
Double the cash...

47:30.509 --> 47:31.886
...plus more diamonds ...

47:32.177 --> 47:33.178
...if the usurper ...

47:33.470 --> 47:37.516
...takes to his heels
and Boulounga back to the pinnacle.

47:40.561 --> 47:41.979
When, how and where?

47:42.271 --> 47:45.232
Tuesday the 27th, one of your men.
Just one...

47:45.524 --> 47:49.153
Will be at the station at
2:45 with the samples.

47:49.445 --> 47:52.740
He'll buy a ticket for
Crecy-la-Chapelle and leave...

47:53.073 --> 47:54.200
...with a deposit ...

47:54.491 --> 47:55.576
...of 30% cash ...

47:55.868 --> 47:58.162
...dollars and cents.

48:01.373 --> 48:04.168
Well?
The operator's transferring me.

48:04.460 --> 48:07.338
Marconi?
Omar Boulounga in person.

48:07.630 --> 48:10.257
So you thought?
Ha! Ha!

48:10.549 --> 48:13.052
Congratulations, you're now looking
at noon to 2pm.

48:13.344 --> 48:15.846
I did not invent sliced bread...

48:16.180 --> 48:19.016
...but I don't mistake candles
for lanterns.

48:19.308 --> 48:21.685
Well, I want one man
present...

48:21.977 --> 48:25.189
with samples at the
Gare de l'Est tomorrow at 2:45.

48:25.481 --> 48:28.943
He'll get a ticket
for La Ferte-Milon.

48:29.235 --> 48:32.780
He will leave with 1st deposit
of the order. OK?

48:33.072 --> 48:34.240
Right. OK!

48:38.994 --> 48:41.080
Ready for more, guys?

48:42.373 --> 48:43.499
Why "guys"?

48:46.085 --> 48:49.797
Well, because there'll be action.

48:50.089 --> 48:53.092
Ah! When there is action,
it's not for girls?

48:55.594 --> 48:56.428
Preconception...

48:56.720 --> 48:58.222
Uh ...

49:00.224 --> 49:01.767
You're not a real...

49:02.643 --> 49:03.727
Real what?

49:05.896 --> 49:08.274
A real girl! Is that it?

49:08.566 --> 49:09.817
I wouldn't not say that.

49:10.150 --> 49:11.110
If that's it.

49:11.402 --> 49:14.113
No.
Is it! Is that what you got wanted say.

49:14.405 --> 49:15.072
No.

49:15.364 --> 49:19.743
Did you mean I'm a tomboy?

49:20.035 --> 49:21.495
That's right.

49:21.787 --> 49:25.791
When I have to fold into a bag,
I'm in the club!

49:50.274 --> 49:53.194
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
arms traffickers ...</i>

49:53.485 --> 49:56.363
<i>... currently waiting
in this station.</i>

49:56.655 --> 49:58.240
<i>Be vigilant.</i>

49:59.074 --> 50:02.953
<i>Do not buy a landmine from
a dealer on the run.</i>

50:03.245 --> 50:06.874
<i>You risk him using it.</i>

50:07.833 --> 50:09.668
<i>Thank you for your attention.</i>

50:39.406 --> 50:42.701
Wow! What's that?

50:42.993 --> 50:46.288
1kg 720 steel
350 grams of polycarbonate ...

50:46.580 --> 50:48.249
...70 grams of kevlar.

50:51.752 --> 50:54.088
And that's not a small Uzi is it?

50:54.380 --> 50:57.216
It's a MAC 10
maybe even even 11.

50:57.508 --> 50:59.134
No, no!

50:59.885 --> 51:02.346
You step on it, you'll lose your foot!

51:02.638 --> 51:03.264
Oh ...

51:04.014 --> 51:05.599
Or your life, perhaps.

51:15.693 --> 51:16.986
Ooh la la

51:17.278 --> 51:19.655
That's for recycling! It's not for us.

51:19.947 --> 51:22.908
I didn't recycle it,
it fell off the back of a tank!

51:23.200 --> 51:24.368
Confiscated!

51:24.910 --> 51:26.704
Thurs tomorrow, play naughty!

51:26.996 --> 51:29.623
Or is Scarface
and his return to Chicago!

51:29.957 --> 51:30.833
If it wasn't here...

51:31.125 --> 51:34.587
Ready for Phase 2?
Strike the iron is hot!

51:34.879 --> 51:37.214
Let's draw!

51:38.090 --> 51:40.092
De Fenouillet, here's Boulounga.

51:40.384 --> 51:42.636
Your Rights
did not appear!

51:42.928 --> 51:46.599
The deal is obsolete. The Vigilante
Armament offered me better.

51:46.891 --> 51:51.270
Make a cross on the diamond
and butter in the spinach.

51:54.565 --> 51:59.069
Music worrying

51:59.361 --> 52:00.529
He sighs.

52:00.821 --> 52:18.130
...

52:18.422 --> 52:20.132
Marconi Boulounga for Omar.

52:20.424 --> 52:22.760
If you could do it
a bit more sober.

52:23.052 --> 52:25.221
Marconi? Boulounga is pissed!

52:25.513 --> 52:28.682
Your boy took to his heels.

52:29.016 --> 52:30.601
The deal is dead and gone.

52:30.893 --> 52:35.314
Aubervillers Armaments are
better customers. Goodbye!

53:31.537 --> 53:33.747
Tambouille,
I have to go out between 1 and 2pm.

53:34.039 --> 53:35.875
Your 2 sharks have taken the bait?

53:36.667 --> 53:39.336
For now, they're biting.
I'm...

53:39.628 --> 53:40.921
...just going to sweeten the pot!

53:42.256 --> 53:45.134
But when it bites,
it will be well hooked..

53:45.426 --> 53:47.720
It's big.
Then I...

53:48.012 --> 53:51.682
Then 'We'
We'll turn the screws.

53:52.391 --> 53:54.560
No, not until we see their faces.

53:58.105 --> 54:00.900
Not gay, gay.
Guet!

54:01.192 --> 54:02.526
Guards!

54:03.068 --> 54:04.778
Yes. Oh well ...

54:05.070 --> 54:08.866
I need volunteers to go on the
roof. Thank you, Calculator.

54:09.158 --> 54:12.661
It's good to have people to
count on.

54:13.162 --> 54:14.038
Good ...

54:21.253 --> 54:23.672
Uh ... where are you going then?

54:23.964 --> 54:25.507
Well, wherever you go.

54:26.508 --> 54:29.887
Excuse me, but I must handle
a delicate matter.

54:30.179 --> 54:31.805
I prefer to go alone.

54:32.556 --> 54:34.934
Ah, I understand.

54:35.518 --> 54:38.229
It is true that in matters
of delicacy ...

54:38.521 --> 54:41.232
...and even subtlety ...

54:43.734 --> 54:45.903
...you're an expert.

55:03.128 --> 55:05.923
"The Diva of Porn,"
She will please you!

55:06.215 --> 55:08.217
Something of a pencil sharpener!

55:09.009 --> 55:12.763
Great, but do you won a nightgown.

55:13.055 --> 55:14.390
I sleep naked.

55:14.640 --> 55:15.975
Hey, Henry ...

55:17.017 --> 55:18.060
...you spell Henri

55:18.352 --> 55:20.187
Not with a Y but with an I.

55:23.732 --> 55:25.025
Oh? Are you sure?

55:25.317 --> 55:27.194
Thierry Henri?
Yeah.

55:27.486 --> 55:30.823
It would be wrong, Thierry Henry?

55:31.115 --> 55:35.286
Do not worry, I'm always game
for the cyclops sneeze.

55:35.828 --> 55:38.289
Well, we'll do as you ask?
Yeah.

55:39.582 --> 55:41.458
Soon.
This evening.

55:48.549 --> 55:49.091
Well?

55:49.383 --> 55:50.926
I thought...

55:51.218 --> 55:54.889
...you're fishing for shark,
not cod or herring!

55:57.099 --> 55:58.309
We're not married.

56:00.227 --> 56:01.896
No, we're not married

56:02.938 --> 56:05.774
Anyway,
perverts are not my thing.

56:06.901 --> 56:09.570
Like me
with contortionists.

56:09.862 --> 56:13.115
My mother always told me
to distrust the twisted.

56:14.825 --> 56:16.285
I'm not twisted.

56:19.163 --> 56:22.791
I am a sensitive soul
in a flexible body.

56:23.083 --> 56:24.418
This is not the same.

56:33.511 --> 56:35.304
<i>Hello?
Listen to me.</i>

56:35.596 --> 56:36.555
You listen to me!

56:36.847 --> 56:37.973
<i>Camel!</i>

56:38.265 --> 56:40.184
I despise your shenanigans!

56:40.476 --> 56:42.978
But the Boulounga diamonds
where you like!

56:43.229 --> 56:47.483
Dickless!
I appears that the teeth, fingers ...

56:47.775 --> 56:52.363
<i>... the bones of the Assyrian kings,
the looting of the Baghdad museum?</i>

56:52.655 --> 56:55.366
If you want war,
think twice about ti!

56:56.992 --> 56:59.078
When one is fortunate to have
divorced...

56:59.370 --> 57:01.997
<i>... to advantage, one doesn't
choose as as mistress...</i>

57:02.248 --> 57:04.542
...the wife of the Prime Minister.

57:05.167 --> 57:09.296
I also have the recording at home.

58:19.033 --> 58:20.701
Well, gotta say ...

58:21.035 --> 58:24.038
...that Grandpa and Grandma
did it in the dark.

58:24.371 --> 58:27.833
So doing it in front of everyone...

58:28.125 --> 58:31.462
...is just a little more dramatic...

58:31.754 --> 58:36.008
...a little more creative,
a little more flexible, right?

58:39.386 --> 58:40.596
Bazil! Hey!

58:40.888 --> 58:41.847
Boo!

58:45.518 --> 58:46.435
Oh ...

58:55.528 --> 58:56.487
Let's go.

59:09.792 --> 59:14.797
And, I'm not too girly to act
the alley cat?

59:15.381 --> 59:18.634
No, precisely why we needed a person...

59:18.926 --> 59:19.844
Flexible!

59:20.845 --> 59:25.391
We needed a person
like you, feline and female.

01:00:31.332 --> 01:00:32.416
Oh dear ...

01:02:17.229 --> 01:02:18.772
Marignan?
1515.

01:02:19.064 --> 01:02:20.816
Nagasaki?
17 kilotons.

01:02:21.108 --> 01:02:22.026
Kiss?

01:02:31.702 --> 01:02:32.870
Hello, sir.

01:02:33.162 --> 01:02:37.499
Something happened last night.
It's most unusual.

01:02:44.215 --> 01:02:45.633
Sir!

01:02:49.512 --> 01:02:52.431
Come on, Maurice.
"Stephen", sir.

01:03:10.741 --> 01:03:13.494
I have a delivery
Mr. De Fenouillet.

01:03:13.786 --> 01:03:16.705
You're out of luck,
he just left.

01:03:16.997 --> 01:03:18.249
Leave it to me.

01:03:18.541 --> 01:03:20.334
It's a bit heavy.

01:03:20.626 --> 01:03:21.377
Ah ...

01:03:24.213 --> 01:03:25.297
Go ahead.

01:03:31.679 --> 01:03:32.763
There.

01:04:11.010 --> 01:04:13.846
7 meters 50 centimeters,
4 millimeters.

01:04:45.085 --> 01:04:48.005
The rubber woman

01:04:48.255 --> 01:04:50.966
With her, you can go crazy.

01:04:52.843 --> 01:04:54.386
She'll make you funny in the head.

01:04:54.678 --> 01:04:56.639
It seeks the above

01:04:56.931 --> 01:04:59.558
And is found below

01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:04.688
The rubber woman.

01:05:25.209 --> 01:05:27.169
Pip squeak.

01:05:27.711 --> 01:05:30.381
You've washed your hands?
YES!

01:05:31.549 --> 01:05:32.591
- Let's see.

01:05:32.883 --> 01:05:34.635
Hey, you!

01:05:36.887 --> 01:05:38.681
There is no laughing at the table.

01:05:38.973 --> 01:05:40.432
She imitates.

01:05:41.183 --> 01:05:43.435
Where are thee,
with thy merchants of death?

01:05:43.727 --> 01:05:47.565
- They're hooked the more they struggle,
the more they're trapped.

01:05:47.857 --> 01:05:50.276
Oh ... when I think
of those poor mothers ...

01:05:50.568 --> 01:05:53.195
...who lose their children
because of mines.

01:05:55.489 --> 01:05:57.157
You know Tambouille?

01:05:58.325 --> 01:06:01.537
She had 2 little girls.
One evening at the Fair of the Throne ...

01:06:01.829 --> 01:06:03.956
...they saw them enter
in the labyrinth.

01:06:04.248 --> 01:06:05.916
She never saw them come out.

01:06:06.208 --> 01:06:09.712
For years, she has searched
the streets.

01:06:10.004 --> 01:06:12.089
Eventually, she became a tramp.

01:06:12.381 --> 01:06:15.467
And after all that,
She adopted us.

01:06:15.759 --> 01:06:16.844
Fifififi ...

01:06:17.136 --> 01:06:19.346
Enough, you lowly masses.

01:06:20.222 --> 01:06:22.224
What can you see my
little salty?

01:06:22.516 --> 01:06:25.144
Fat: 62%, protein: 4% ...
OH!

01:06:25.394 --> 01:06:26.312
Ben who?

01:06:26.604 --> 01:06:29.231
A little salty is as it should be...

01:06:29.481 --> 01:06:32.193
...a black belt
at Cordon Bleu.

01:06:32.484 --> 01:06:33.986
Oh, surely not ...

01:06:34.278 --> 01:06:36.322
Even if... oh no.

01:06:36.614 --> 01:06:39.366
You got an idea for cooking
your 2 big fish?

01:06:39.658 --> 01:06:42.661
Frying.
There's more to roll in flour.

01:06:44.538 --> 01:06:45.623
In the flour!

01:07:22.451 --> 01:07:26.372
Fracasso, no doubts?
No! He has no doubts.

01:07:33.128 --> 01:07:35.589
Go! We will balance the Fracasse!

01:07:36.423 --> 01:07:37.633
It blows.

01:07:47.017 --> 01:07:48.018
Calculator!

01:07:48.310 --> 01:07:49.728
Distance: 138 meters.

01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:52.648
Wind Speed: 12 km / h
Direction: south/southwest.

01:07:52.898 --> 01:07:54.441
There.
Weight of the projectile?

01:07:54.733 --> 01:07:56.110
76 kilos.

01:07:56.402 --> 01:07:59.071
Add 4.
It's Tambouille's fault.

01:07:59.363 --> 01:08:00.781
OK ... say 80.

01:08:01.073 --> 01:08:02.491
Why did you add more?

01:08:02.783 --> 01:08:06.245
Slice: 70 grams.
Butter: 37 g. Jam ...

01:08:06.495 --> 01:08:08.622
Okay, okay!
Come on, get ready.

01:08:18.006 --> 01:08:19.341
Remington!

01:08:20.301 --> 01:08:22.178
For the committee's approval!

01:08:23.636 --> 01:08:24.513
<i>Engine!</i>

01:08:30.978 --> 01:08:32.270
It's time to go.

01:08:32.563 --> 01:08:35.441
No, it's too early. 59 ...

01:08:37.401 --> 01:08:38.903
58 ...

01:08:39.194 --> 01:08:40.571
...
57 ...

01:08:41.863 --> 01:08:42.656
56 ...

01:08:44.450 --> 01:08:46.118
55 seconds.

01:08:46.410 --> 01:08:47.411
Oh!

01:08:57.254 --> 01:08:58.506
Closet, well then?

01:08:58.796 --> 01:09:03.135
What? It's recycled!
It's old...

01:09:03.426 --> 01:09:04.303
Oh!

01:09:17.691 --> 01:09:18.692
Closet!

01:09:19.609 --> 01:09:21.612
You Bastard!

01:09:22.571 --> 01:09:24.156
But it's recycled!

01:10:18.669 --> 01:10:19.587
Fire!

01:11:37.498 --> 01:11:38.499
Watch out!

01:11:45.214 --> 01:11:46.340
Come on, move!

01:11:51.637 --> 01:11:52.388
Watch out!

01:12:19.498 --> 01:12:21.542
No batteries?!
How?!

01:12:21.834 --> 01:12:23.836
It's recycled.
It's recycled?!

01:12:24.128 --> 01:12:27.506
I broke the altitude record!
and I had proof!

01:12:27.798 --> 01:12:28.924
One minute, butterfly!

01:12:29.216 --> 01:12:30.050
What?

01:12:30.342 --> 01:12:34.805
I devoted myself to the filming!
That's the last straw!

01:12:35.097 --> 01:12:36.807
No Battery.

01:12:40.644 --> 01:12:40.978
It's an unwritten law:
One key to the equipment.

01:12:43.939 --> 01:12:45.149
It's going to explode.

01:12:45.441 --> 01:12:48.527
It's her.
Code 5, no quarter.

01:12:53.490 --> 01:12:56.452
You are Madame Cisse?
Yes.

01:12:56.702 --> 01:12:58.287
Your husband had a problem.

01:12:58.954 --> 01:13:00.956
What happened?

01:13:01.790 --> 01:13:05.169
Your husband is ashamed:
He lost your residency permit.

01:13:05.961 --> 01:13:07.671
Then I only have to request
a duplicate.

01:13:07.922 --> 01:13:11.342
That's what I did
with Edward Mangin ...

01:13:11.634 --> 01:13:13.594
...my friend the Prefect of Police.

01:13:13.886 --> 01:13:15.596
But your record was not found.

01:13:16.305 --> 01:13:18.432
But I assure you...

01:13:18.724 --> 01:13:20.059
hmmm?

01:13:21.477 --> 01:13:22.394
Who are you?

01:13:23.687 --> 01:13:26.607
I'm part of the company
that employs your husband.

01:13:26.899 --> 01:13:29.360
You see, our activities relate to...

01:13:29.652 --> 01:13:31.195
...national defense ...

01:13:31.487 --> 01:13:32.905
At the same time,
Obviously ...

01:13:33.197 --> 01:13:35.908
we feel oblige to protect
children.

01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:40.204
I can always try
put pressure on my friend Mangin

01:13:40.538 --> 01:13:42.665
That's good,
I'm seeing him tomorrow evening.

01:13:42.957 --> 01:13:44.917
I know,
you think what?

01:13:47.628 --> 01:13:48.712
Show him.

01:13:50.130 --> 01:13:52.466
In all arsenals,
they have the same machine.

01:13:52.716 --> 01:13:54.343
You see where she is?

01:13:54.635 --> 01:13:56.762
It's essential, it must be installed
with ...

01:13:57.054 --> 01:13:59.682
...bulkhead opening on the outside..

01:13:59.932 --> 01:14:01.016
...like that.

01:14:01.308 --> 01:14:04.562
This has been done
to guide the air out ...

01:14:04.854 --> 01:14:06.355
...in case of...

01:14:06.647 --> 01:14:11.110
The technician will activate the machine
behind the door.

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:13.404
ideally we would be to proceed ...

01:14:13.696 --> 01:14:17.032
...during lunch
when the machine is paused.

01:14:17.324 --> 01:14:19.243
What should I do?
Almost nothing.

01:14:19.493 --> 01:14:23.789
You unscrew the small tube
you slide the steel ball out ...

01:14:24.081 --> 01:14:26.292
...and that's all.

01:14:27.877 --> 01:14:29.253
Is this dangerous?

01:14:29.545 --> 01:14:31.839
Returning to Somalia
is dangerous too.

01:14:32.506 --> 01:14:34.550
I put it where I?
Ah!

01:14:35.718 --> 01:14:39.305
Do not bother to
seek the dust underneath.

01:15:12.296 --> 01:15:14.381
You have a moment?

01:15:17.801 --> 01:15:20.596
It is forbidden to park here
with this load.

01:15:20.888 --> 01:15:23.057
Don't worry, I'll be quick.

01:16:16.527 --> 01:16:18.320
By God!

01:16:43.387 --> 01:16:46.098
That's weird.
Usually, he warns me.

01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:49.393
In the time of his father
you would not come.

01:16:51.312 --> 01:16:52.605
There's nothing to sign?
No.

01:16:52.897 --> 01:16:53.981
Thank you very much.

01:17:05.701 --> 01:17:08.954
Bazil, this blackmail evidence,
What is it?

01:17:09.246 --> 01:17:11.081
It may be a video ...

01:17:11.373 --> 01:17:14.251
...tape, envelopes,
photos ...

01:17:14.543 --> 01:17:16.754
It can be anything
and anywhere.

01:17:17.671 --> 01:17:18.881
Thanks for the clarification.

01:17:19.548 --> 01:17:21.091
From there, please.

01:17:23.093 --> 01:17:24.512
That slab ...

01:17:29.808 --> 01:17:32.436
We enter.

01:17:33.437 --> 01:17:34.897
Where's the package?

01:17:35.189 --> 01:17:37.650
I understand it was there.

01:17:37.942 --> 01:17:39.485
The nanny had put it away.

01:17:39.777 --> 01:17:42.154
No, your son is with his mother.

01:17:42.446 --> 01:17:44.490
His mother ...
Ah yes, true.

01:17:44.782 --> 01:17:46.367
Get me the package.

01:17:46.659 --> 01:17:49.703
I assure you ...
I understand.

01:17:51.997 --> 01:17:53.666
Oh, this will be sweet...

01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:03.759
<i>... this afternoon
Aubervilliers Arsenal ...</i>

01:18:19.191 --> 01:18:21.986

01:18:22.278 --> 01:18:24.321

01:18:26.574 --> 01:18:28.617
<i>It is a scandal!</i>

01:18:28.909 --> 01:18:30.619
<i>The information on LCI.</i>

01:18:50.264 --> 01:18:52.892
Calm, calm... Breath.

01:18:55.811 --> 01:18:59.106
Practice:
The crucial issues.

01:18:59.398 --> 01:19:00.941
Number 12: Who...

01:19:01.233 --> 01:19:03.485
...invents jokes?

01:19:03.777 --> 01:19:07.781
No. 27: Why the place we seek on
a map always in the fold?

01:19:08.073 --> 01:19:11.577
No. 62: How much erosion is caused
by walking?

01:19:16.332 --> 01:19:18.959
<i>The CEO

01:19:42.066 --> 01:19:43.984
It will be the blitzkrieg!

01:19:44.276 --> 01:19:45.778
- Sir, We have a go?

01:19:46.278 --> 01:19:47.279
Go!

01:19:47.863 --> 01:19:49.615
Go.
Go.

01:19:50.115 --> 01:19:51.367
Go!

01:20:29.071 --> 01:20:30.364
Ah! What now..

01:20:51.218 --> 01:20:52.136
That's it then?

01:20:53.846 --> 01:20:56.932
You thought
we would rot in prison?

01:20:57.558 --> 01:21:00.477
You're impressed by our resolve?

...dosh, pennies!

01:21:35.721 --> 01:21:36.764
Yeah!

01:22:07.962 --> 01:22:08.879
No!

01:22:10.548 --> 01:22:12.675
Tut tut tut ... Hush.

01:22:14.718 --> 01:22:15.845
Oh ...

01:22:51.922 --> 01:22:53.090
Oh! No!

01:23:01.682 --> 01:23:04.393
- I came to
give you a little lesson ...

01:23:04.685 --> 01:23:08.939
...but these clown
gave me another idea.

01:23:12.151 --> 01:23:13.736
Oh no ...

01:23:15.321 --> 01:23:16.447
How?

01:23:19.450 --> 01:23:21.410
You'd never take such a risk.

01:23:22.369 --> 01:23:23.704
What risk?

01:23:25.206 --> 01:23:30.211
You refused to sell arms to
rebels who were fomenting a coup.

01:23:30.503 --> 01:23:33.047
They planted a bomb
in Arsenals

01:23:33.339 --> 01:23:35.508
...before coming
to get you!

01:23:35.799 --> 01:23:38.552
We rushed to your aid...

01:23:39.553 --> 01:23:40.804
Isn't that so, Libarski?

01:23:41.096 --> 01:23:43.015
We arrived a bit too late.

01:23:44.642 --> 01:23:46.101
This is perfect.

01:23:46.352 --> 01:23:47.686
Wait, wait ...

01:24:06.539 --> 01:24:07.373
Ah!

01:24:07.665 --> 01:24:10.167
I'll give you the tape
with evidence.

01:24:10.459 --> 01:24:13.212
The teeth, fingers,
the looting of Baghdad Museum.

01:24:13.504 --> 01:24:15.965
You take it and you leave.

01:24:18.843 --> 01:24:20.302
It's not enough.

01:24:20.594 --> 01:24:23.556
Oh, okay,
stop your bullshit!

01:24:26.058 --> 01:24:28.686
OK,
I would not have sabotaged your plant.

01:24:28.936 --> 01:24:30.646
But you stole my shells.

01:24:32.147 --> 01:24:33.065
What shells?

01:24:33.941 --> 01:24:35.359
Well ...

01:24:36.026 --> 01:24:37.570
...the shell truck.

01:24:38.696 --> 01:24:40.823
You stole a shell truck.

01:24:41.115 --> 01:24:42.783
We did what?
No.

01:24:43.909 --> 01:24:44.785
It wasn't us.

01:24:46.245 --> 01:24:47.621
The truck, wasn't me.

01:24:47.913 --> 01:24:50.416
It was probably them.

01:24:51.542 --> 01:24:54.211
Yes, it must be them.

01:24:54.670 --> 01:24:57.131
Him... it's him!

01:24:57.423 --> 01:25:00.259
He was spotted in the video!

01:25:00.551 --> 01:25:02.094
He was disguised as a server.

01:25:02.386 --> 01:25:04.513
I thought it worked for you.

01:25:04.763 --> 01:25:06.182
I thought he worked for you...

01:25:06.473 --> 01:25:07.808
...dirty trick number 2.

01:25:08.100 --> 01:25:11.228
What madness!
Who do you work for?

01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:15.357
Er... I'm on my own.

01:25:16.901 --> 01:25:18.903
I have a bachelor flat.

01:25:19.195 --> 01:25:20.779
We'll question him there?

01:25:21.071 --> 01:25:22.823
My car is outside.

01:25:23.157 --> 01:25:24.742
It's not too early!

01:25:25.034 --> 01:25:27.870
You're late.
The problem is over.

01:25:28.704 --> 01:25:29.580
That's him.

01:25:31.916 --> 01:25:33.125
Oh ...

01:25:34.001 --> 01:25:36.295
Aeschylus died after ...

01:25:36.587 --> 01:25:38.172
...a turtle hit his head.

01:25:38.464 --> 01:25:42.885
Jean-Baptiste Lully,
died of gangrene.

01:25:43.177 --> 01:25:47.515
Barbarossa, by forgetting to remove
his armor to cross a river.

01:25:47.806 --> 01:25:52.686
And I'm dying stupidly too
feeling like a jerk.

01:26:34.979 --> 01:26:37.273
Closet, Plan B.

01:26:37.565 --> 01:26:42.653
Emergency!

01:28:00.648 --> 01:28:01.690
Bridge of Crimea!

01:28:01.941 --> 01:28:04.610
Everyone out!
Ha! Ha! Ha!

01:28:10.074 --> 01:28:11.575

01:28:18.833 --> 01:28:20.334
Come on, jump!

01:28:28.300 --> 01:28:30.261
- 240, 230 ...

01:28:30.553 --> 01:28:32.388

01:28:51.323 --> 01:28:52.783
Drop the trash!

01:29:02.626 --> 01:29:03.711
Slowly.

01:29:18.058 --> 01:29:19.518
Oh shit...

01:29:19.810 --> 01:29:21.604
It picks up garbage!

01:29:56.805 --> 01:29:58.516
They're over us...
on the bridge!

01:29:58.807 --> 01:30:01.769
The carrots are cooked,
you have drawn a blank.

01:30:03.687 --> 01:30:05.272
Hope you enjoy the sun.

01:30:05.564 --> 01:30:07.900
We're paying for your vacation in
North Africa.

01:30:16.158 --> 01:30:18.827
Closet, good landing, thank you.

01:30:19.119 --> 01:30:21.872

RECYCLED'!

01:30:38.889 --> 01:30:39.890

01:30:42.643 --> 01:30:43.686

01:31:31.525 --> 01:31:32.818
You recognize this?

01:31:50.002 --> 01:31:53.214
and you, recognize this?

01:32:07.603 --> 01:32:10.648
Shhh! Tut tut tut ...

01:32:10.940 --> 01:32:12.316
Don't move.

01:32:13.776 --> 01:32:14.818
Don't move.

01:32:30.709 --> 01:32:32.378
You want a ransom?!

01:32:35.464 --> 01:32:37.967
Demand a price we can afford.

01:32:40.177 --> 01:32:41.262
I am a friend ...

01:32:41.554 --> 01:32:43.472
...with the President of the Republic.

01:32:43.764 --> 01:32:47.059
Take away this grenade, it's ridiculous!

01:32:47.852 --> 01:32:51.313
We'll call,
you'll see, he will pay.

Ah yes ...
That's forgiveness.

01:33:12.376 --> 01:33:13.836
Sorry for women ...

01:33:14.128 --> 01:33:16.297
...who are raped

01:33:16.589 --> 01:33:20.009

Me too.

- And on Darfur, where do you think
their explosives from?

01:33:47.036 --> 01:33:49.246
You encouraged the market?

01:33:49.497 --> 01:33:51.499
Kind of pathetic!
