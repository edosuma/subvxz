WEBVTT

00:02.880 --> 00:05.832
Come on! Will you... will
you go? Come on, go, go.

00:05.884 --> 00:07.142
Hey, you cheated on your current wife

00:07.143 --> 00:08.147
with seven different women.

00:08.148 --> 00:09.651
I got digital proof of all of it.

00:09.652 --> 00:10.943
And if you don't stop seeing Krista,

00:10.943 --> 00:12.505
your wife will know everything.

00:12.557 --> 00:14.458
- Done.
- And one more thing.

00:14.459 --> 00:16.893
I'm gonna need something from you.

00:16.928 --> 00:19.896
I don't just hack you,
Krista, I hack everyone.

00:19.931 --> 00:23.099
So I gotta be honest,
I was impressed by you.

00:23.151 --> 00:28.404
I think I can land you
a pretty lucrative gig.

00:28.440 --> 00:32.505
- Who are you?
- That'll come later.

00:32.610 --> 00:35.945
Elliot, listen to me.
I will never leave you.

00:35.947 --> 00:37.530
I will never leave you alone again.

00:37.582 --> 00:42.742
- Who are you talking to?
- Since last month,

00:42.743 --> 00:45.829
- Evil Corp has moved its tapes to five...
- Five backup facilities

00:45.830 --> 00:48.252
and you have a plan to take them all down.

00:48.253 --> 00:50.416
Why are you working with us?

00:52.347 --> 00:55.782
The hack, everything, maybe
we shouldn't execute it.

00:55.783 --> 00:56.966
Why?

00:57.018 --> 00:59.435
The minute our infected server
gets back on the main network,

00:59.471 --> 01:00.637
we're set.

01:00.639 --> 01:02.805
Scott will continue here,

01:02.857 --> 01:05.275
but you, I'm afraid, cannot.

01:05.812 --> 01:07.680
_

01:08.705 --> 01:09.874
_

01:09.981 --> 01:12.281
- What the hell are you...
- Shh.

01:12.282 --> 01:13.922
I don't know what your grand plan is,

01:13.923 --> 01:15.747
but I need to, and you're going to tell me.

01:19.207 --> 01:20.643
Why did you do it?

01:20.644 --> 01:23.793
What did you hope to
accomplish by doing all of this?

01:24.694 --> 01:26.996
I wanted to save the world.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.074

01:43.181 --> 01:46.566
Hey.

01:46.601 --> 01:48.685
It's so good to see you.

01:56.244 --> 01:58.471
You look great.

01:58.472 --> 02:01.831
- Can I get you a drink?
- Look, Michael, I don't...

02:04.753 --> 02:07.003
Jesus.

02:07.038 --> 02:09.122
I forgot.

02:09.174 --> 02:11.507
It's not even your real name.

02:14.212 --> 02:16.713
It's, uh... Lenny.

02:19.184 --> 02:22.301
Lenny.

02:22.354 --> 02:25.054
So tell me what's going on.

02:25.106 --> 02:28.224
How advanced is it?

02:28.226 --> 02:31.060
I already emailed my
friend at Sloan Kettering.

02:31.112 --> 02:32.528
If it's as serious as you say...

02:32.564 --> 02:34.981
- Krista. Krista.
- Then she wants to...

02:35.033 --> 02:36.232
Look.

02:40.372 --> 02:41.704
I'm not dying.

02:45.160 --> 02:47.126
You're a sick motherfucker!

02:47.162 --> 02:48.202
Look, hold on. It's the only way

02:48.203 --> 02:49.960
- I could get you to meet up.
- Don't you ever call me again,

02:49.961 --> 02:53.102
- even when you are dying.
- One of your patients hacked me.

02:53.635 --> 02:55.501
Some kid.

02:55.553 --> 02:58.421
His name's Elliot Alderson.

02:58.423 --> 03:01.174
I went to the police already.

03:01.226 --> 03:04.260
Please sit back down.

03:04.262 --> 03:06.145
We need to talk about this.

03:17.158 --> 03:20.193
Here. The police had
their cyber crime division

03:20.245 --> 03:21.778
look into it.

03:21.830 --> 03:26.115
They've been trying to track
him down for the past six weeks.

03:26.117 --> 03:28.035
- What is this?
- That proves it was him.

03:28.036 --> 03:30.286
He took my dog to the vet.

03:30.288 --> 03:33.289
Look. See, she was microchipped,

03:33.341 --> 03:36.843
and I gave her chip number
to all the vets in the city.

03:39.631 --> 03:43.349
This sick fucker not only
hacked me and ruined my life,

03:43.384 --> 03:45.134
he stole my dog on top of it.

03:47.605 --> 03:48.967
This guy's certifiable.

03:48.968 --> 03:52.191
I mean, he's seeing you,
so technically he is.

03:52.192 --> 03:58.043
- What did he do to you exactly?
- He made me...

04:00.618 --> 04:03.569
you know...

04:03.621 --> 04:05.822
say all those things to you.

04:10.295 --> 04:13.129
This kid should not be
allowed to do what he did.

04:13.164 --> 04:16.332
He hacked into my private life.

04:16.334 --> 04:19.084
And then that Ashley
Madison leak happened.

04:19.137 --> 04:22.505
My wife found out about
everything anyway.

04:22.507 --> 04:25.141
After the whole thing, she left me.

04:25.176 --> 04:27.477
I can't even see my little girl.

04:27.512 --> 04:31.363
- The divorce is... is a nightmare.
- I don't give a shit about your divorce.

04:31.364 --> 04:33.015
Look, if he's doing this to me,

04:33.067 --> 04:36.185
then he must be doing this to other people.

04:36.187 --> 04:37.687
Think about it.

04:37.689 --> 04:40.656
If he knew enough
about me to hack me,

04:40.692 --> 04:43.910
then that means he must
have hacked you, too.

04:46.414 --> 04:48.865
He did, didn't he?

04:58.009 --> 05:03.504
- I can't talk about this with you.
- Hey! You have to help me catch him.

05:05.049 --> 05:06.849
The dog thing alone isn't enough.

05:06.885 --> 05:10.136
My buddy says this
Computer Abuse and Fraud Act

05:10.188 --> 05:11.721
is tough to prosecute.

05:11.773 --> 05:14.190
You need a lot of evidence.

05:14.225 --> 05:16.309
This kid is good, Krista.

05:16.361 --> 05:19.862
He was routing through something
called proxies or something

05:19.898 --> 05:20.897
out in Estonia.

05:20.899 --> 05:22.231
He's untraceable.

05:22.283 --> 05:24.400
Short of that whole
country falling apart,

05:24.402 --> 05:27.153
we're never gonna get our
hands on any real evidence.

05:27.205 --> 05:33.680
- Just what exactly do you think I can do?
- Maybe he said something.

05:34.879 --> 05:37.413
You know, in your sessions.

05:37.415 --> 05:40.499
Oh, come on, don't give me that
privileged information bullshit.

05:40.552 --> 05:42.835
This guy's committing
a crime, a serious one.

05:42.887 --> 05:45.254
He deserves to go to jail.

05:45.306 --> 05:47.974
If you know something,

05:48.009 --> 05:50.593
if he said anything,
you have to tell me.

05:52.096 --> 05:55.932
Look, I'm not the enemy here.

05:55.934 --> 05:59.101
He is.

05:59.103 --> 06:01.687
We were a good thing.

06:01.739 --> 06:03.606
Remember?

06:03.608 --> 06:06.943
I mean, don't you remember this place?

06:08.663 --> 06:11.948
We had some good times here.

06:11.950 --> 06:14.116
Come on.

06:16.120 --> 06:20.089
Don't stay mad at me.

06:20.124 --> 06:21.958
I really loved you.

06:26.264 --> 06:29.465
He never told me anything.

06:29.517 --> 06:31.934
I can't help you.

06:40.478 --> 06:43.479
The asshole stole my dog!

07:05.219 --> 07:07.803
The response to the Japanese
and Chinese stock markets

07:07.839 --> 07:10.339
has provoked panic, setting
off the downward trends

07:10.341 --> 07:12.341
of the European stock exchange.

07:12.343 --> 07:14.010
But what's even more worrisome

07:14.012 --> 07:17.346
is that the IMF has no leverage
against these defaults.

07:17.348 --> 07:19.565
Already, 17 governments
are said to be

07:19.600 --> 07:22.985
in large-scale crises with
some on the verge of collapse.

07:23.021 --> 07:25.021
Among the countries are Lithuania,

07:25.073 --> 07:27.523
Croatia, Ukraine, Romania,

07:27.525 --> 07:30.192
the Czech Republic, and Estonia.

07:30.194 --> 07:32.194
This faction has deemed
the hack inflicted

07:32.246 --> 07:34.030
upon the world's largest conglomerate

07:34.082 --> 07:37.533
as an opportunity for reform
and a chance to start anew,

07:37.535 --> 07:40.202
building more egalitarian
economies with lessons learned

07:40.254 --> 07:43.089
from decades of economic disparity.

07:43.124 --> 07:44.840
A spokesperson for a group...

07:53.551 --> 08:00.133
- Synced and corrected by skoad -
www.addic7ed.com

08:31.639 --> 08:34.527
- Where am I?
- Excuse me?

08:34.726 --> 08:36.467
- I mean, where am I?
- You've been parked

08:36.469 --> 08:38.427
in the lot for the past two days.

08:38.479 --> 08:39.895
That's as much as you paid me

08:39.931 --> 08:41.597
before the credit card systems went down.

08:41.649 --> 08:42.732
I'm gonna need some cash, man.

08:49.357 --> 08:51.073
This is Tyrell's.

08:54.779 --> 08:56.278
Why were we in there?

08:56.330 --> 08:58.030
Oh, don't tell me you don't have any cash.

08:58.082 --> 09:00.583
Ha, you're shit out of
luck for a while, buddy.

09:00.618 --> 09:04.420
I don't understand.

09:04.455 --> 09:08.924
How long have you been asleep?

09:08.960 --> 09:12.044
Seriously, what do you remember?

09:12.096 --> 09:14.764
Wait, I don't even trust you.

09:19.470 --> 09:20.469
Hey.

09:20.471 --> 09:22.221
Hey, where you going?

09:22.273 --> 09:25.107
What about your car?

09:25.143 --> 09:29.145
Hey, we're gonna tow your car tonight!

09:57.308 --> 10:00.370
- What took you so long?
- I just had to shower and change.

10:00.371 --> 10:04.146
You're still new here. I wouldn't push it.

10:25.503 --> 10:27.453
Jesus Christ, finally you're here.

10:27.505 --> 10:29.337
- Where have you been?
- Yeah, man.

10:29.338 --> 10:31.674
I mean, not cool, not cool at all.

10:31.709 --> 10:33.375
I thought we were
gonna execute together.

10:33.377 --> 10:35.044
I mean, what is going on here?

10:35.096 --> 10:37.179
He's just saying that we
had planned on something

10:37.215 --> 10:39.684
- a little more ceremonial.
- Ceremonial? Man,

10:39.685 --> 10:40.799
we been wiping drives,

10:40.852 --> 10:43.302
wrangling cables, pulling
fiber taps and the...

10:43.354 --> 10:44.553
Okay, everyone, lay off!

10:44.555 --> 10:46.522
I'm sure he had his reasons.

10:46.557 --> 10:48.891
Besides, whatever. The
point is, it worked.

10:48.893 --> 10:51.227
- Jesus, what did I do?
- We need to clean up

10:51.229 --> 10:52.645
and get the hell out of here.

10:52.697 --> 10:54.396
Were you there? Did you see it?

10:54.448 --> 10:57.213
- What did I do?
- Elliot, what's going on?

10:57.214 --> 10:59.203
You disappear on me at the apartment

10:59.204 --> 11:01.570
and come here to execute
without even telling me.

11:01.622 --> 11:04.490
Execute. It executed, but how?

11:04.542 --> 11:06.588
- I... what happened to Tyrell?
- Then you were gone

11:06.589 --> 11:08.994
for another three days.

11:09.046 --> 11:14.815
- Where have you been?
- Are you saying... it went through?

11:15.086 --> 11:17.219
Like gangbusters.

11:17.255 --> 11:18.837
People are loving it.

11:18.890 --> 11:21.340
They actually want to join fsociety.

11:21.392 --> 11:25.010
Elliot, they're organizing
protests all across the city.

11:35.847 --> 11:38.771
_

11:39.911 --> 11:42.414
_

11:42.415 --> 11:45.056
_

11:45.057 --> 11:49.289
_

11:49.290 --> 11:52.835
_

11:52.836 --> 11:55.240
_

11:55.241 --> 11:59.262
_

11:59.463 --> 12:02.131
Elliot! What's going on?

12:05.803 --> 12:11.234
- Are you still seeing him?
- No, but I need to.

12:12.310 --> 12:14.643
Dude, you can't just leave.

12:14.695 --> 12:15.634
We're in wipe-down mode here

12:15.635 --> 12:20.232
- and we need your help.
- I told you we shouldn't have done this.

12:25.142 --> 12:27.410
So, okay, your burn rate,

12:27.445 --> 12:30.159
that's rent and utilities
alone, is 50,000 a month.

12:30.160 --> 12:32.181
Your lease isn't up for
another three months,

12:32.216 --> 12:34.716
so we have to eat those
costs no matter what.

12:34.718 --> 12:38.554
So that leaves us with
staffing, operations,

12:38.606 --> 12:41.940
outstanding loans, equipment rentals.

12:41.976 --> 12:43.559
I'm just gonna call it, Gideon.

12:43.611 --> 12:47.396
You have to shut down Allsafe.

12:47.398 --> 12:51.733
Maybe I can just buy some time.

12:51.735 --> 12:53.569
We could bounce back from this.

12:53.571 --> 12:55.404
Gideon, your number one client

12:55.406 --> 12:57.406
is in the middle of a major crisis.

12:57.408 --> 13:00.042
You can't escape the
fallout from this.

13:00.077 --> 13:02.211
As your part-time CFO and your friend,

13:02.246 --> 13:04.580
I have to be honest and tell you,

13:04.582 --> 13:06.381
this is beyond bleak.

13:06.417 --> 13:12.161
- When is it not?
- I'm sorry?

13:13.591 --> 13:15.924
Ever since I started this company,

13:15.926 --> 13:18.594
it's felt like we've just been

13:18.596 --> 13:23.015
rearranging chairs on
the goddamn "Titanic."

13:23.067 --> 13:24.817
When was the last time you and I

13:24.852 --> 13:28.814
- have not had a depressing conversation?
- Gideon, I handle the money.

13:28.815 --> 13:30.939
It's always gonna be a
depressing conversation.

13:38.782 --> 13:40.916
Best thing you can do for them

13:40.951 --> 13:43.335
is to let them know soon
so they can find other jobs.

13:43.370 --> 13:47.289
And...

13:47.341 --> 13:48.770
What?

13:50.544 --> 13:52.571
All their 401(k)s were

13:52.572 --> 13:54.138
tied up in the market...

13:54.139 --> 13:57.633
Which is expected to
plummet once the bell rings.

13:57.635 --> 14:01.436
Well, that's only rumors at this point.

14:01.472 --> 14:02.771
What?

14:02.806 --> 14:05.524
Seems to be a little more than rumors.

14:05.559 --> 14:07.476
Every bank is essentially affected.

14:07.528 --> 14:09.945
I know I couldn't use any of my
credit cards over the weekend.

14:09.980 --> 14:12.447
Could you?

14:12.483 --> 14:13.866
Well, I don't know.

14:13.901 --> 14:15.984
There might be a silver lining to all this.

14:16.036 --> 14:18.487
If what they're saying
about these fsociety hackers

14:18.489 --> 14:22.658
is actually true, you'll now have no debt.

14:35.795 --> 14:38.497
Why did Tyrell let this happen?

14:42.146 --> 14:44.680
He was with me. I told
him the whole plan.

14:44.682 --> 14:48.016
He was gonna stop it.

14:48.018 --> 14:52.404
A simple program, a worm that
can make data unreadable,

14:52.439 --> 14:55.908
malware that took Darlene
maybe two hours to code.

14:55.943 --> 14:59.528
Is that really all it
takes to kill the world?

14:59.582 --> 15:01.749
Shouldn't I be enjoying this?

15:01.988 --> 15:04.375
- _
- Why am I even looking for Tyrell?

15:04.376 --> 15:06.168
Isn't this what we wanted?

15:09.506 --> 15:11.540
So this is what a
revolution looks like,

15:11.542 --> 15:14.092
people in expensive
clothing running around.

15:14.128 --> 15:15.711
Not how I pictured it.

15:17.264 --> 15:19.047
I wonder what stage they're at.

15:19.099 --> 15:21.516
Denial? Muttering to themselves?

15:21.552 --> 15:23.602
No, this can be fixed.

15:23.637 --> 15:27.022
Maybe bargaining, forcing
their techs to work overtime

15:27.057 --> 15:28.690
to try to decrypt our data.

15:28.726 --> 15:32.027
Or have they come to
the realization yet

15:32.062 --> 15:33.862
that Darlene encrypted everything

15:33.897 --> 15:36.982
with 256-bit AES and it would take

15:37.034 --> 15:40.535
an incomprehensible
amount of time to crack?

15:40.571 --> 15:45.374
That all of their data is
actually gone for good?

15:52.750 --> 15:54.750
No, I have to find him.

15:56.971 --> 15:58.920
I have to know what happened.

16:03.843 --> 16:05.727
_

16:07.014 --> 16:13.277
- Can I help you with something?
- Yes, I'm looking for Tyrell Wellick.

16:13.278 --> 16:16.238
He's not here.

16:16.273 --> 16:18.273
He doesn't work here anymore.

16:18.275 --> 16:19.741
Why are you here? What do
you need to see him for?

16:19.777 --> 16:21.576
And, yes, confirmation coming in.

16:21.612 --> 16:23.779
This is fsociety
claiming responsibility

16:23.781 --> 16:25.447
for the hack.

16:25.499 --> 16:27.416
We are cutting live to
the video right now.

16:27.451 --> 16:33.005
Evil Corp, we have delivered
on our promise as expected.

16:33.040 --> 16:37.592
The people of the world who
have been enslaved by you

16:37.628 --> 16:39.544
have been freed.

16:39.596 --> 16:42.431
Your financial data
has been destroyed.

16:42.466 --> 16:44.850
Any attempts to salvage it

16:44.885 --> 16:47.602
will be utterly futile.

16:47.638 --> 16:51.390
Face it, you have been owned.

16:51.442 --> 16:54.443
We at fsociety will smile

16:54.478 --> 16:59.448
as we watch you and
your dark soul die.

16:59.483 --> 17:02.284
That means any money
you owe these pigs

17:02.319 --> 17:04.869
has been forgiven by us,

17:04.905 --> 17:08.457
your friends at fsociety.

17:08.492 --> 17:10.959
The market's opening
bell this morning

17:10.993 --> 17:14.212
will be the final death
knell of Evil Corp.

17:14.248 --> 17:17.999
We hope, as a new society
rises from the ashes,

17:18.001 --> 17:20.502
that you will forge a better world,

17:20.503 --> 17:23.171
a world that values a free people,

17:23.223 --> 17:26.391
a world where greed
is not encouraged,

17:26.426 --> 17:30.145
a world that belongs to us again,

17:30.180 --> 17:34.349
a world changed forever!

17:34.351 --> 17:38.987
And while you do that,
remember to repeat these words.

17:39.022 --> 17:41.857
We are fsociety.

17:41.909 --> 17:45.401
- We are finally free.
- _

17:45.402 --> 17:49.364
We are finally awake!

17:55.038 --> 17:57.038
Authorities have been trying
to locate the whereabouts

17:57.091 --> 17:58.874
of the mysterious masked man

17:58.926 --> 18:01.877
as well as other members
of the fsociety collective.

18:01.929 --> 18:04.129
The investigation is still underway.

18:04.181 --> 18:07.421
The FBI Cybercrime
Division is working with...

18:12.974 --> 18:14.807
Where's my bag?

18:14.859 --> 18:17.977
I need my bag. It... it has all my papers.

18:18.029 --> 18:20.363
I put all of your talking
points on these index cards

18:20.398 --> 18:21.774
- so that you wouldn't have to...
- God damn it!

18:21.775 --> 18:24.901
Will you please just give
me my bag, for Christ's sake?

18:24.953 --> 18:26.819
I asked you to keep it close by.

18:26.871 --> 18:28.154
I'm sorry.

18:28.156 --> 18:30.123
I didn't mean anything by it.

18:30.158 --> 18:32.334
- I was just trying to...
- Never mind what you meant.

18:32.335 --> 18:33.709
Just do as I say.

18:38.633 --> 18:41.801
I'm sorry.

18:41.836 --> 18:44.220
I didn't mean to snap at you.

18:44.255 --> 18:46.172
It's been a long day,

18:46.174 --> 18:49.892
and... and I'm not used to
all the new faces around here.

18:51.930 --> 18:53.513
No problem.

18:53.565 --> 18:55.515
Four minutes, people!

18:55.567 --> 18:57.850
Let's get last looks. Let's go.

18:57.852 --> 19:01.988
So anyways, this should
fry anything and everything

19:02.023 --> 19:03.189
to a crisp.

19:03.191 --> 19:04.524
You're in luck. My boss is at the bank.

19:04.576 --> 19:06.192
Seems like everybody's
lining up this morning.

19:06.244 --> 19:08.411
So you got some time.

19:08.446 --> 19:09.743
Jesus,

19:09.744 --> 19:13.249
- are we really doing this right now?
- Hey, I don't need no judgment.

19:13.284 --> 19:14.917
Not like I want to be here either.

19:14.953 --> 19:17.670
Sorry, dude, I got no sympathy.

19:17.705 --> 19:20.506
You don't want to put cute
puppies out of their misery,

19:20.542 --> 19:22.425
you don't have to.

19:22.460 --> 19:23.709
That's just sick.

19:23.761 --> 19:25.261
That ain't on me. I gotta pay the bills.

19:25.296 --> 19:27.547
That's the only reason why I'm here.

19:51.122 --> 19:54.624
You know, I've run all the scenarios

19:54.659 --> 19:59.128
of our little revolution here, but, uh...

19:59.164 --> 20:02.748
using a dead puppy oven was not on my list.

21:20.995 --> 21:23.496
Can I help you?

21:32.674 --> 21:33.839
Yeah.

21:33.891 --> 21:36.676
Looking for Tyrell Wellick.

21:36.728 --> 21:40.612
- Is he here?
- No.

21:41.015 --> 21:43.933
He's not.

21:46.521 --> 21:48.187
Do you know where he is?

21:51.359 --> 21:55.207
- Who are you?
- Good question.

21:56.331 --> 21:57.947
We work together.

22:01.786 --> 22:03.502
He'll be home soon.

22:03.538 --> 22:05.755
Just called me from
the car ten minutes ago.

22:05.790 --> 22:08.040
He's stuck in some traffic.

22:08.042 --> 22:10.259
You're welcome to wait
inside if you want.

22:10.295 --> 22:12.211
Whoo! Oh, shit!

22:12.213 --> 22:14.130
- Come on, get up!
- Fsociety, bitch!

22:14.182 --> 22:17.044
- Yeah, that's how it is, baby!
- Whoo!

22:21.570 --> 22:23.222
What did you say your name was?

22:25.643 --> 22:28.728
Uh... I'm Ollie.

22:30.948 --> 22:33.566
And what were you working
on with my husband?

22:33.618 --> 22:35.735
You've gotta help
me get out of this.

22:35.737 --> 22:37.236
There's something about her.

22:37.238 --> 22:38.788
I feel like she can hear us.

22:38.823 --> 22:41.040
He wanted my advice,

22:41.075 --> 22:45.578
you know, about the hack
that's going on right now.

22:45.580 --> 22:47.496
When was the last time you saw him?

22:50.001 --> 22:52.718
She's lying to me. He isn't coming.

22:52.754 --> 22:55.588
She's fishing for something.

22:55.590 --> 22:58.474
I'm not sure.

22:58.509 --> 23:01.260
It was last week, I think.

23:01.262 --> 23:03.479
Really?

23:06.351 --> 23:10.770
You know, between you and me,

23:10.772 --> 23:14.440
I'm a little concerned for Tyrell.

23:14.492 --> 23:16.992
Was he acting strange when you saw him?

23:19.831 --> 23:23.616
No.

23:23.618 --> 23:26.001
That's funny,

23:26.037 --> 23:29.038
'cause he was acting very strange

23:29.090 --> 23:31.841
last I saw him.

23:31.876 --> 23:33.676
Three days ago.

23:35.849 --> 23:38.165
Didn't she say he just called?

23:38.800 --> 23:40.132
And then he just vanished.

23:48.476 --> 23:52.027
Excuse me?

23:52.063 --> 23:53.813
I don't understand what you're saying.

24:02.240 --> 24:09.144
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I think it's just the stress

24:09.145 --> 24:12.965
from the past few days getting to me.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.584
Anyway, I shouldn't take
up any more of your time.

24:18.055 --> 24:22.057
Thank you... Ollie.

24:49.203 --> 24:50.920
And, Sarah, we've had meetings all weekend

24:50.955 --> 24:53.038
handling the situation.

24:53.090 --> 24:54.757
I'm being told by our network storage team

24:54.792 --> 24:57.259
that they are in fact
getting to the bottom of this.

24:57.295 --> 24:59.879
Mr. Plouffe, have you seen
the latest stock price?

24:59.931 --> 25:02.181
It's hitting an all-time low of $18,

25:02.216 --> 25:03.883
and it's still dropping.

25:03.885 --> 25:06.385
How are people reacting
to this on the inside?

25:06.437 --> 25:10.556
Almost $400 billion of
wealth was lost today.

25:10.608 --> 25:14.610
That's pretty astounding.
Are you concerned?

25:14.645 --> 25:16.729
That's an interesting question.

25:16.731 --> 25:18.731
But right now we're focused on tackling

25:18.733 --> 25:20.616
the technical issues at hand.

25:20.651 --> 25:22.568
We have loyal customers who are suffering,

25:22.620 --> 25:25.538
and our number one priority
is to address their needs.

25:25.573 --> 25:27.907
We had one of our experts
in here earlier today.

25:27.959 --> 25:29.575
They're saying that if, in fact,

25:29.577 --> 25:31.494
fsociety's claims are true...

25:31.546 --> 25:33.078
Your data is inaccessible

25:33.080 --> 25:35.748
and could prove nearly
impossible to recover.

25:35.750 --> 25:38.083
And given that there does seem
to be some legitimacy to this...

25:38.135 --> 25:41.086
The White House is with us on this.

25:41.088 --> 25:42.755
They're gonna protect everyone's money.

25:42.757 --> 25:45.474
The bottom line is

25:45.510 --> 25:48.427
the public does not
need to worry about this.

25:48.429 --> 25:50.896
Mr. Plouffe, this
was a massive attack.

25:50.932 --> 25:54.233
All of your servers, including
your data center in China

25:54.268 --> 25:56.902
as well as your offline
backups have been destroyed.

25:56.938 --> 26:00.439
I'm not really sure you can
ask the public not to worry.

26:12.370 --> 26:14.286
- You want me to be honest?
- Of course.

26:14.338 --> 26:18.090
You're right. Absolutely right.

26:18.125 --> 26:21.293
The public should be worried.

26:21.345 --> 26:25.431
I mean, personally, my life is over.

26:25.466 --> 26:27.099
What's happening?

26:27.134 --> 26:31.303
My pension, savings, everything...

26:31.305 --> 26:33.606
has been in this company
since I started here,

26:33.641 --> 26:37.476
and that's all gone now.

26:37.478 --> 26:40.145
Truth is...

26:40.197 --> 26:42.982
I've been with the
engineering team all weekend.

26:43.034 --> 26:45.117
This has to stop. That's enough.

26:45.152 --> 26:46.819
No one knows how to fix it.

26:48.656 --> 26:52.157
In fact, about the only
thing we do know for certain

26:52.159 --> 26:55.628
is that...

26:55.663 --> 26:59.665
this will be impossible to fix.

26:59.717 --> 27:01.884
You need to take care of this.

27:12.013 --> 27:15.848
Calm down, everyone.

27:25.396 --> 27:27.397
That's all we need from
Ms. Moss, Mr. Price.

27:27.399 --> 27:29.132
- Good. Thank you.
- Sir.

27:29.134 --> 27:30.600
Thanks.

27:41.479 --> 27:45.681
I heard you were leaving for the day.

27:45.683 --> 27:50.419
Mr. Price...

27:50.421 --> 27:55.658
- did you need me to stay?
- No, no, no, no. Sit, sit.

27:55.659 --> 27:57.910
I know I'm the CEO of the company,

27:57.912 --> 28:00.963
but what you went
through, it was traumatic.

28:00.965 --> 28:05.217
I just felt I needed to
make myself available.

28:05.219 --> 28:07.837
You are absolutely free to... to go home

28:07.839 --> 28:13.059
and... and recover, of course.

28:13.061 --> 28:16.095
All right?

28:18.850 --> 28:21.100
Oh.

28:21.102 --> 28:25.354
You're Terry's reference, right?

28:27.158 --> 28:30.326
I rarely see him impressed
with anyone, but you... you?

28:30.328 --> 28:34.947
Well... we're glad you're on the team.

28:34.949 --> 28:39.785
And I look forward to
you impressing me as well.

28:39.787 --> 28:42.371
You know, I'm... I'm
holding a press conference

28:42.373 --> 28:44.040
this afternoon.

28:44.042 --> 28:45.624
Since you're new to the PR department,

28:45.626 --> 28:47.176
I think you should attend.

28:47.178 --> 28:50.212
You might pick up some invaluable lessons.

28:52.517 --> 28:56.802
Um...

28:56.804 --> 28:59.221
no.

28:59.223 --> 29:02.692
No, I'm not sure that I can.

29:06.114 --> 29:10.700
Well, the invitation is open

29:10.702 --> 29:13.736
if you should change your mind.

29:16.240 --> 29:18.574
Um...

29:27.251 --> 29:29.418
You need some new shoes.

29:29.420 --> 29:31.804
Those won't do anymore.

30:10.545 --> 30:12.211
Tyrell Wellick's gone.

30:12.213 --> 30:15.840
I wake up in his SUV and the
world's about to fall apart.

30:25.526 --> 30:27.143
I know. I know this looks bad,

30:27.145 --> 30:29.258
but I'm sure there's an explanation.

30:30.398 --> 30:32.231
Don't think that. We'll find him.

30:32.233 --> 30:34.617
We'll find him. He's
gotta be somewhere.

30:34.619 --> 30:37.119
My dad, Mr. Robot,
whatever the hell he is,

30:37.121 --> 30:39.789
if he's not gonna show
up, maybe he got sloppy,

30:39.791 --> 30:42.662
left behind a clue.

30:42.663 --> 30:44.905
_

31:17.161 --> 31:21.197
All right, come out!

31:21.199 --> 31:22.865
Come out now!

31:26.204 --> 31:29.622
Come on!

31:29.624 --> 31:32.541
I need to know what happened!

31:32.543 --> 31:34.627
Come on out!

31:34.629 --> 31:36.629
I'm here!

31:36.631 --> 31:39.515
I'm waiting for you!

31:39.517 --> 31:41.684
Come on, man.

31:41.686 --> 31:43.219
Come out!

31:43.221 --> 31:46.722
Okay, we have to go analog for this.

31:46.724 --> 31:48.891
We need to get these fliers out now

31:48.893 --> 31:52.061
since we can't be sure anyone's
Internet access will work.

31:56.817 --> 32:00.319
What? I'm thinking ahead.

32:00.321 --> 32:03.072
First banking, then infrastructure.

32:03.074 --> 32:05.824
We've been through this.

32:05.826 --> 32:09.044
Now, take these fliers, pass them out.

32:09.046 --> 32:13.215
It's the last step and then we're clear.

32:13.217 --> 32:16.752
You guys are acting like we're
walking towards doomsday here.

32:16.754 --> 32:19.471
Well, it does say here

32:19.473 --> 32:24.176
it's an end of the world party.

32:24.178 --> 32:26.178
Figure of speech.

32:32.069 --> 32:34.186
You wonder why we're
not in high spirits?

32:34.188 --> 32:35.938
Maybe it's because our fearless leader goes

32:35.940 --> 32:38.274
and shoots up the world
and then disappears,

32:38.276 --> 32:41.493
yet again, while we're
here cleaning up after him.

32:53.372 --> 32:55.860
_

33:19.150 --> 33:21.567
He knows the password,

33:21.569 --> 33:24.283
which means I know the password.

33:30.653 --> 33:33.137
_

34:05.112 --> 34:07.529
What's he trying to say?

34:07.531 --> 34:10.616
I'm on the hook for everything?

34:18.009 --> 34:20.842
He won't come out to play if I ask.

34:20.844 --> 34:23.879
So maybe I gotta force his hand.

34:25.599 --> 34:27.549
I need to use a landline.

34:27.551 --> 34:30.552
I need to get myself arrested.

34:35.693 --> 34:39.554
- 911. What's your emergency?
- I have a confession to make.

34:40.731 --> 34:43.565
All right, you got me.

34:43.567 --> 34:46.235
I'm afraid to ask.

34:46.237 --> 34:49.288
Now, wait a minute, you said you work...

34:51.909 --> 34:56.078
Was this from the guy?

34:56.080 --> 35:00.165
The one they're talking about on the news?

35:00.167 --> 35:05.137
Um... yes.

35:09.226 --> 35:15.147
You mean to tell me you
witnessed this thing...

35:15.149 --> 35:17.733
and you're here to buy new shoes?

35:22.857 --> 35:25.991
Wow.

35:25.993 --> 35:28.944
That's pretty...

35:28.946 --> 35:31.663
It's just pretty cold.

35:31.665 --> 35:34.249
How can you work there?

35:34.251 --> 35:36.335
That guy said it himself,
they're just liars.

35:36.337 --> 35:40.255
I know. They are.

35:40.257 --> 35:43.342
But I'm not sure

35:43.344 --> 35:45.461
that he knew what he was saying.

35:45.463 --> 35:47.296
Oh, you sound just like them.

35:47.298 --> 35:51.350
Have some moral fiber
and leave their asses.

35:51.352 --> 35:53.469
Their practices are well-documented

35:53.471 --> 35:55.637
and it's all despicable.

35:55.639 --> 35:58.056
Listen, this isn't my business,

35:58.058 --> 35:59.775
but don't drink their Kool-Aid.

35:59.777 --> 36:01.977
Look, I just needed a job.

36:01.979 --> 36:03.312
What kind of an excuse is that?

36:03.314 --> 36:05.364
- You don't understand.
- You should hear yourself.

36:05.366 --> 36:07.581
I don't know who you
think you're talking to,

36:07.582 --> 36:10.235
but I'll try the Pradas next.

36:34.228 --> 36:36.979
Calm down.

36:36.981 --> 36:40.349
Get your caramel latte. It's on me.

36:40.351 --> 36:43.685
- Where is he?
- You know how this looks, right?

36:43.686 --> 36:45.437
Very weird.

36:49.693 --> 36:51.432
I don't give a shit.

36:51.433 --> 36:55.998
- Where's Tyrell?
- We made a deal that helped us both.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.700
Tell me where he is!

36:58.702 --> 37:00.252
You're starting to attract some attention.

37:00.254 --> 37:02.621
I recommend you get one of
those Bluetooth headsets.

37:02.623 --> 37:04.506
That way people just think
you're the local douche.

37:04.508 --> 37:06.758
Tyrell disappeared.

37:06.760 --> 37:10.546
No one knows where he is.

37:10.548 --> 37:11.713
But you know.

37:14.969 --> 37:17.936
So do you.

37:17.938 --> 37:20.522
You forget, kiddo, I am you.

37:23.027 --> 37:27.082
- No, you're not.
- Is that a fact?

37:40.411 --> 37:43.879
Hey, man, I gotta tell you I had
sex with your mom this morning,

37:43.881 --> 37:45.297
and it was fantastic.

37:48.002 --> 37:51.086
Don't have time for you, little man.

37:51.088 --> 37:54.256
Your mom was real nice. Smell.

37:54.258 --> 37:56.425
God! What did you do to him?

37:56.427 --> 37:58.143
What did I do?

37:58.145 --> 37:59.478
Well, did you just see what he did?

37:59.480 --> 38:01.396
- No, I don't know, man.
- Yeah, he flicked my nose.

38:05.753 --> 38:08.170
You're losing it, kiddo.

38:11.542 --> 38:13.875
I'm only supposed to be your prophet.

38:13.877 --> 38:17.021
You're supposed to be my god.

38:17.721 --> 38:19.069
Come on!

38:19.291 --> 38:22.210
The dramatic repercussions of
the recent financial meltdown

38:22.245 --> 38:24.412
are not relegated to
developing nations.

38:24.464 --> 38:27.081
The United States has also
witnessed a disruption

38:27.133 --> 38:28.833
of order and peace.

38:28.835 --> 38:31.636
While businesses determine how
or whether they will function

38:31.671 --> 38:34.088
through the uncertainty,
individuals have taken

38:34.140 --> 38:36.891
to the streets, giving the
major cities a tenor...

38:36.927 --> 38:39.260
Ooh.

38:39.312 --> 38:41.679
Very nice.

38:41.681 --> 38:43.431
I'm glad you reconsidered.

38:47.931 --> 38:50.271
What? What is it?

38:50.323 --> 38:53.024
Come on.

38:53.026 --> 38:54.859
You have questions.

38:54.911 --> 38:56.995
I'm a person with a lot of answers,

38:57.030 --> 38:59.197
especially right now.

39:02.085 --> 39:05.703
Okay.

39:05.755 --> 39:09.874
It's just that...

39:09.926 --> 39:13.594
well, I can't help but wonder,

39:13.630 --> 39:15.847
why do you seem so confident?

39:18.551 --> 39:22.437
Everyone else is worried, but you?

39:22.472 --> 39:25.606
You're sure that you're
gonna get through this.

39:25.642 --> 39:28.643
- Why?
- Hmm.

39:33.450 --> 39:37.500
- People did this. Right?
- _

39:37.501 --> 39:40.621
I mean, aliens didn't
invade our planet.

39:40.657 --> 39:43.041
Zeus didn't come out of
the heavens to destroy us.

39:43.076 --> 39:46.133
Zombies haven't risen from the dead.

39:46.647 --> 39:48.913
No.

39:48.965 --> 39:51.165
Whoever's behind this,

39:51.217 --> 39:53.751
they're just people...

39:53.753 --> 39:58.172
like you and me.

39:58.224 --> 40:00.091
Except, of course, I have the full weight

40:00.093 --> 40:03.594
of the biggest conglomerate
in the world behind me.

40:03.646 --> 40:06.981
You'll come to realize
that when you have that,

40:07.017 --> 40:12.020
matters like this, they tend to crack...

40:12.072 --> 40:14.381
under that weight.

40:16.943 --> 40:20.452
Can I ask another question?

40:20.453 --> 40:24.115
All right, go.

40:24.167 --> 40:26.451
Why me?

40:26.453 --> 40:30.538
Why am I really here?

40:30.590 --> 40:32.590
I know you know who I am.

40:32.625 --> 40:35.543
Why are you letting me be here?

40:35.595 --> 40:39.881
Why are you even talking to me right now?

40:39.933 --> 40:42.266
None of this makes any sense.

40:42.302 --> 40:46.437
Well, be that as it may, I...

40:46.473 --> 40:49.440
I find you refreshing.

40:49.476 --> 40:52.810
You're young, bold,

40:52.862 --> 40:57.031
exactly what we need right now.

40:57.067 --> 40:59.400
- Come on.
- What?

40:59.452 --> 41:02.236
There has to be more to it than that.

41:02.288 --> 41:05.706
Angela, just a word of advice.

41:05.742 --> 41:08.326
Don't talk your way out of a compliment.

41:08.328 --> 41:11.796
Excuse me. They'll be ready.

41:11.831 --> 41:13.831
Shall we?

41:21.341 --> 41:25.143
Oh, you're still thinking
about this morning.

41:27.680 --> 41:30.681
I don't think I'll ever get
that image out of my head.

41:33.520 --> 41:37.155
Between you and me, I was
glad he killed himself.

41:39.109 --> 41:40.608
He was not a very good person.

41:40.660 --> 41:42.693
He had a gambling problem.

41:42.745 --> 41:44.328
He drank too much.

41:44.364 --> 41:47.115
Most notably, he was weak.

41:47.167 --> 41:49.667
His instincts left a lot to be desired.

41:49.702 --> 41:53.421
Oh, I despise people like that.

41:53.456 --> 41:57.091
In fact, I felt...

41:57.127 --> 42:01.179
the world was a little better off

42:01.214 --> 42:05.633
knowing he wasn't in it anymore.

42:05.685 --> 42:09.887
Oh, I believe even his
family will benefit from this

42:09.939 --> 42:12.223
in the long run.

42:28.208 --> 42:30.791
Before we even begin,

42:30.827 --> 42:33.411
let's have a moment of silence

42:33.463 --> 42:37.131
for our dear, brave friend,

42:37.167 --> 42:39.634
James Plouffe.

42:54.734 --> 42:57.068
Well, this place is a petri dish now.

42:57.103 --> 43:00.321
Yeah, I'd say we got enough
fingerprints everywhere.

43:00.356 --> 43:02.406
So that's it then, right?

43:02.442 --> 43:04.575
That's it?

43:04.611 --> 43:07.612
That's it?

43:07.614 --> 43:10.615
How about, "That's amazing"?

43:10.667 --> 43:12.617
How about we party

43:12.669 --> 43:15.286
and thank ourselves for
all the hard work we did?

43:15.338 --> 43:18.766
Yeah, I don't think Trenton
was talking about tonight.

43:19.152 --> 43:21.443
- Well, what then?
- Well, you know,

43:21.444 --> 43:23.346
I think she's saying after tonight, right?

43:23.347 --> 43:26.655
Then what? I mean, what do we all do now?

43:26.656 --> 43:30.268
Guys, this isn't about
what we'll do tomorrow!

43:30.303 --> 43:31.969
This is about what we did.

43:32.021 --> 43:34.472
I mean, look at all these people.

43:34.524 --> 43:38.142
They're free because of us,

43:38.144 --> 43:41.812
because of what we did in this room.

43:41.864 --> 43:44.732
We're finally awake!

43:51.291 --> 43:53.908
We are finally alive.

43:56.231 --> 43:58.168
- Our streets!
- Whose streets?

43:58.169 --> 44:00.061
- Our streets!
- Whose streets?

44:00.062 --> 44:01.462
- Our streets!
- Whose streets?

44:01.464 --> 44:02.579
Our streets!

44:02.581 --> 44:04.248
- Whose streets?
- Our streets!

44:04.250 --> 44:06.133
- Whose streets?
- Our streets!

44:06.135 --> 44:08.085
- Whose streets?
- Our streets!

44:08.087 --> 44:10.905
- I know you killed him.
- Our streets!

44:10.906 --> 44:13.193
I know you did it. I know you did it.

44:13.195 --> 44:15.279
Just tell me what happened to Tyrell.

44:15.281 --> 44:18.125
- Our streets!
- Shut up!

44:18.367 --> 44:20.534
I have played nice for far too long.

44:20.536 --> 44:22.202
I'm so sick of your whining.

44:22.204 --> 44:24.538
It's not gonna change anything anyway.

44:24.540 --> 44:27.841
Please, you have to do something.

44:27.843 --> 44:29.376
You have to help me.

44:29.378 --> 44:32.464
- Say something. Make him tell me.
- Stop talking to them!

44:32.882 --> 44:34.882
They can't help us.

44:34.884 --> 44:37.134
We have to do this together, just us.

44:37.136 --> 44:39.887
He's right, you know.

44:41.691 --> 44:45.643
You're hurting the
whole family, Elliot.

44:45.645 --> 44:48.562
No, no, this isn't my family.

44:48.564 --> 44:50.481
None of them are real.

44:50.483 --> 44:52.533
Neither is whoever you're talking to.

44:55.237 --> 44:57.821
Then you're not real.

44:57.823 --> 45:00.457
You're not real.

45:00.459 --> 45:02.743
What? You are?

45:02.745 --> 45:05.713
Is any of it real?

45:05.715 --> 45:09.500
I mean, look at this. Look at it!

45:09.502 --> 45:12.086
A world built on fantasy!

45:12.088 --> 45:13.921
Synthetic emotions in the form of pills,

45:13.923 --> 45:17.341
psychological warfare in
the form of advertising,

45:17.343 --> 45:20.728
mind-altering chemicals
in the form of food,

45:20.730 --> 45:23.063
brainwashing seminars in the form of media,

45:23.065 --> 45:26.433
controlled isolated bubbles
in the form of social networks.

45:26.435 --> 45:29.353
Real? You want to talk about reality?

45:29.355 --> 45:32.189
We haven't lived in
anything remotely close to it

45:32.191 --> 45:33.607
since the turn of the century.

45:33.609 --> 45:35.442
We turned it off, took out the batteries,

45:35.444 --> 45:37.578
snacked on a bag of GMOs

45:37.580 --> 45:40.781
while we tossed the remnants
in the ever-expanding dumpster

45:40.783 --> 45:42.616
of the human condition.

45:42.618 --> 45:45.285
We live in branded houses
trademarked by corporations

45:45.287 --> 45:47.588
built on bipolar numbers

45:47.590 --> 45:50.541
jumping up and down on digital displays,

45:50.543 --> 45:54.128
hypnotizing us into the biggest
slumber mankind has ever seen.

45:54.130 --> 45:55.963
You have to dig pretty deep, kiddo,

45:55.965 --> 45:57.965
before you can find anything real.

45:57.967 --> 46:00.384
We live in a kingdom of bullshit,

46:00.386 --> 46:02.636
a kingdom you've lived in for far too long.

46:02.638 --> 46:05.973
So don't tell me about not being real.

46:05.975 --> 46:07.608
I'm no less real than
the fucking beef patty

46:07.610 --> 46:09.226
in your...

46:09.228 --> 46:10.894
As far as you're concerned, Elliot,

46:10.896 --> 46:12.613
I am very real.

46:12.615 --> 46:15.649
We are all together now,
whether you like it or not.

46:21.791 --> 46:25.659
No! No!

46:25.661 --> 46:27.661
No!

46:33.169 --> 46:36.720
I want to be alone.

46:36.722 --> 46:38.088
I need to be alone.

47:23.469 --> 47:26.239
No, you don't want that, remember?

47:28.390 --> 47:30.891
Remember how you felt
when you were alone?

47:30.893 --> 47:32.726
You were in pain.
You were miserable.

47:32.728 --> 47:37.147
That's why we're here.

47:37.149 --> 47:39.199
Those lonely nights
when you sat and cried

47:39.201 --> 47:43.153
in your apartment, you
begged us to help you.

47:43.155 --> 47:45.906
You asked us to come.
You needed us to come.

47:45.908 --> 47:48.292
No!

47:48.294 --> 47:51.044
I want you to leave!

47:51.046 --> 47:52.329
Leave!

47:52.331 --> 47:54.047
We're deep down inside you, Elliot.

47:54.049 --> 47:57.835
You can't leave us,
and we can't leave you.

47:57.837 --> 47:59.386
Ever.

47:59.388 --> 48:01.839
It's true, Son.

48:06.428 --> 48:10.097
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

48:16.272 --> 48:18.739
I'll tell you exactly
what you're gonna do.

48:18.741 --> 48:21.275
You're gonna start listening to us.

48:21.277 --> 48:24.444
The world is a better place
because of what we did, Elliot,

48:24.446 --> 48:27.581
and you're gonna realize
that one way or another.

48:27.583 --> 48:29.867
Now, here's what I
need you to do now.

48:32.288 --> 48:34.755
You're going to walk to the subway.

48:39.929 --> 48:42.296
You're going to get on your train.

48:59.031 --> 49:01.949
You're going to get
off at your stop.

49:01.951 --> 49:04.117
Woohoo-hoo-hoo!

49:08.958 --> 49:10.490
You're going to go home.

49:16.332 --> 49:18.665
You're gonna sit at your computer,

49:18.667 --> 49:20.834
watch and enjoy the
beautiful carnage

49:20.836 --> 49:23.804
that we've all created together.

49:23.806 --> 49:27.174
We hope a new society
rises from the ashes,

49:27.176 --> 49:29.343
that you will forge a better world.

51:47.149 --> 51:49.566
- Well, enjoy the evening.
- Thank you.

51:53.906 --> 51:55.789
- How are you?
- Good evening.

51:55.791 --> 51:57.707
- Good to see you.
- Thank you.

52:23.185 --> 52:27.070
Go ahead. What's on your mind?

52:27.072 --> 52:30.190
I know you're not without your troubles,

52:30.192 --> 52:33.860
but we still haven't
discussed the coltan mines.

52:33.862 --> 52:36.196
You're really bringing
that up at a time like this?

52:36.198 --> 52:39.950
You asked, I answered, succinctly.

52:39.952 --> 52:43.203
Well, perhaps I was too hasty.

52:43.205 --> 52:46.873
I'd like, for the moment,
to take in the music.

52:46.875 --> 52:50.844
Besides... plenty of
other items on our agenda.

52:50.846 --> 52:53.213
The fucking Congo can wait.

52:53.215 --> 52:57.801
Oh, your troubles are
weighing heavily on you.

52:57.803 --> 52:59.803
I'm not entirely sure why.

52:59.805 --> 53:03.023
I was told that you know
the person responsible.

53:03.025 --> 53:06.026
Yes. Yes.

53:06.028 --> 53:09.896
Of course we do.

53:09.898 --> 53:13.150
And we will handle that person

53:13.152 --> 53:15.068
as we usually do.

53:22.327 --> 53:28.081
- You seem a little preoccupied yourself.
- I don't believe in preoccupation.

53:30.085 --> 53:32.085
It's more of an observation.

53:32.087 --> 53:35.347
- Which is?
- The infamous Emperor Nero

53:35.348 --> 53:39.505
played an instrument very similar
to the one she's playing, the lyre.

53:40.596 --> 53:42.692
Legend has it that he played it merrily

53:42.693 --> 53:46.600
as he watched...

53:46.602 --> 53:52.251
- As he watched?
- As he watched Rome burn.
