WEBVTT

00:05.004 --> 00:05.922
(knocking on door)

00:05.004 --> 00:05.922
TAMMY: Hey!

00:06.005 --> 00:07.382
Come on in.

00:07.465 --> 00:10.051
Bonnie's still getting dressed.

00:10.135 --> 00:11.219
Whoa.

00:11.302 --> 00:14.055
I feel like I just walked
into an after-school special.

00:14.139 --> 00:17.517
My very tall wife likes to keep
the cereal up in the clouds.

00:17.600 --> 00:19.060
Well, let me help
you with that.

00:19.144 --> 00:20.270
Thanks.

00:20.353 --> 00:21.604
Which one were
you reaching for?

00:21.688 --> 00:23.064
You mean there's more
than just one?

00:23.148 --> 00:25.442
I've never seen
exactly what's up there.

00:25.525 --> 00:27.610
You got Cheerios,
Honey Nut Cheerios,

00:27.694 --> 00:28.945
some sort of Raisin Bran...

00:29.028 --> 00:31.114
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Honey Nut Cheerios?

00:31.197 --> 00:33.783
She tried to convince me
they stopped making those.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.662
You know, this kitchen
really isn't set up for you.

00:37.746 --> 00:40.457
Yeah, after I burned my chin
making eggs, I just gave up.

00:41.291 --> 00:43.293
Hey, I'm thinking
we could trick this place out

00:43.376 --> 00:44.294
like we did at the bar.

00:44.377 --> 00:46.296
You know, lower the cabinets,
get the appliances

00:46.379 --> 00:47.464
at the right height.

00:47.547 --> 00:49.632
I don't know, you'd have
to ask the building manager.

00:49.716 --> 00:52.135
The building manager
hasn't had coffee yet, so no.

00:53.178 --> 00:55.180
Did you give him
the good Cheerios?

00:55.263 --> 00:56.973
You mean the ones
you've been hiding from me?

00:57.056 --> 00:58.600
Well, I wouldn't have
to hide them

00:58.683 --> 01:00.477
if you didn't eat 'em all
in one sitting.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.979
You do know my entire life
is one sitting?

01:04.189 --> 01:05.940
I was just telling Adam

01:06.024 --> 01:08.109
this kitchen could be
a lot more accessible for him.

01:08.193 --> 01:10.111
I tried. The owner
won't pay for renovations.

01:10.195 --> 01:12.614
Well, I'm your friend.
I'll do it for cost.

01:10.195 --> 01:12.614
That'd be great.

01:12.697 --> 01:14.282
Would that mean my kitchen
would be torn up for weeks

01:14.365 --> 01:15.492
so I couldn't cook?

01:15.575 --> 01:17.118
Probably.

01:15.575 --> 01:17.118
That's fine.

01:17.202 --> 01:20.163
Come on, we're gonna be late
for the meeting.

01:20.246 --> 01:21.956
Hey! Whoa, where are you going
with those?

01:22.040 --> 01:24.209
Somewhere you can't get 'em.

01:26.586 --> 01:28.880
I mean, the worst thing
that happened to me

01:28.963 --> 01:30.840
was that success came so young.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.967
You know, one minute
we're just a bunch of lads

01:33.051 --> 01:35.345
playing music
in Liam's mum's basement,

01:35.428 --> 01:38.848
and the next, we're on
a tour bus with money and drugs

01:38.932 --> 01:40.642
and women
falling over themselves

01:40.725 --> 01:42.060
to take a turn with me.

01:44.062 --> 01:45.355
See, what they don't tell you is

01:45.438 --> 01:49.692
that the most addictive drug
of all is fame.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.528
Do you know who he is?

01:51.611 --> 01:55.198
Not a clue, but I think
he thinks we know who he is.

01:55.281 --> 01:56.991
I mean, when I should've been
enjoying my seat

01:57.075 --> 01:59.661
at life's great feast,
I found myself

01:59.744 --> 02:02.664
in a hotel room alone,
hiding in a closet

02:02.747 --> 02:04.541
with a bag of drugs,
afraid to come out

02:04.624 --> 02:06.835
'cause I was pretty sure
there was a monster out there,

02:06.918 --> 02:10.463
or worse, someone who'd want
to share my drugs.

02:12.131 --> 02:14.008
I mean,
I should've been dead, right?

02:14.092 --> 02:15.718
But God had another plan for me.

02:15.802 --> 02:18.555
Well, God and my managers,
who staged an intervention.

02:18.638 --> 02:22.058
Next up on the set list was my
first meeting, and guess what.

02:22.141 --> 02:24.686
The universe raised its lighter

02:24.769 --> 02:27.647
and brought old Roddy
back for an encore.

02:30.149 --> 02:32.151
No way. It's Rod.

02:32.235 --> 02:34.112
Who's Rod?

02:32.235 --> 02:34.112
From the band Sachet.

02:34.195 --> 02:35.196
Sachet?

02:35.280 --> 02:38.366
He was in love with me for
a serious chunk of 1987.

02:38.449 --> 02:40.702
There was a time when
every woman in America

02:40.785 --> 02:41.953
wanted a taste of that.

02:42.036 --> 02:44.664
Well, I was here then.
I don't think so.

02:46.165 --> 02:48.167
♪ ♪

02:56.843 --> 02:58.553
(music playing over phone)

02:58.636 --> 03:01.347
Is he wearing
a strap-on piano?

03:02.348 --> 03:04.434
It's called a keytar.

03:04.517 --> 03:05.768
It was a real breakthrough
in music,

03:05.852 --> 03:08.563
'cause it allowed
the keyboard player to dance.

03:08.646 --> 03:11.649
It's weird that Sachet
doesn't have a Wikipedia page.

03:11.733 --> 03:13.735
I have a Wikipedia page.

03:13.818 --> 03:15.445
Hang on, this is the best part.

03:15.528 --> 03:16.779
See, most men
can't prance like that

03:16.863 --> 03:19.073
and still be considered sexy.

03:19.157 --> 03:20.909
I like those shoulder pads.

03:20.992 --> 03:24.245
I tried 'em once
and took out a wall sconce.

03:24.329 --> 03:26.247
Looks like the whole band had
the Jennifer Aniston haircut

03:26.331 --> 03:28.249
way before it was trendy.

03:28.333 --> 03:29.626
(music stops)

03:29.709 --> 03:31.419
Gosh, you remember
where you were

03:31.502 --> 03:32.587
when you first heard that song?

03:32.670 --> 03:35.006
Yeah, right here, right now.

03:37.342 --> 03:38.676
BONNIE:
Look at him.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.095
I never would have
imagined he'd get sober.

03:41.179 --> 03:42.931
Last time I saw him,
we were Lady and the Tramp-ing

03:43.014 --> 03:44.974
a big, fat line of blow.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.101
Did you talk to him
after the meeting?

03:47.185 --> 03:49.145
No, I wasn't gonna wait in line
to shake his hand.

03:49.228 --> 03:50.605
His hand and I have history.

03:50.688 --> 03:52.315
(chuckles)

03:52.398 --> 03:53.483
Oh, I shook his hand.

03:53.566 --> 03:56.778
I swear to God, that man
sleeps in gloves with lotion.

03:56.861 --> 03:58.947
I should start
doing that again.

03:59.030 --> 04:00.990
How long were the
two of you together?

04:01.074 --> 04:03.159
(exhales) Let's see.
I guess it would have been...

04:03.242 --> 04:04.452
(tongue clicks)

04:04.535 --> 04:06.162
...three, maybe four nights?

04:07.205 --> 04:09.958
That was your serious chunk
of 1987?

04:10.041 --> 04:11.709
I've been in love
for four nights.

04:11.793 --> 04:13.628
You should go say hey.

04:13.711 --> 04:15.213
(speaking indistinctly)

04:16.589 --> 04:18.925
All right. I'm gonna do it.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.686
Hello.

04:29.769 --> 04:31.020
Hi.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.647
I don't mean to interrupt.

04:32.730 --> 04:36.526
I just wanted to say... hello.

04:36.609 --> 04:39.362
Hello.
(chuckles)

04:39.445 --> 04:42.573
Rod. Rod, Rod, Rod.

04:44.242 --> 04:45.493
Can you
believe this?

04:45.576 --> 04:47.495
Can you believe
we're still alive?

04:47.578 --> 04:49.580
I cannot.

04:47.578 --> 04:49.580
(laughs)

04:50.623 --> 04:53.167
Ah, so many memories.

04:53.251 --> 04:54.502
Indeed.

04:54.585 --> 04:56.337
And then to see you
in the meeting...

04:56.421 --> 04:58.840
Oh, you were in the meeting.
Oh, good for you.

04:58.923 --> 04:59.841
Good for both of us.

04:59.924 --> 05:01.300
Yeah.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.770
All right. Enjoy that BLT.

05:12.854 --> 05:14.063
(laughs)

05:15.314 --> 05:17.275
We have plenty of time
to catch up.

05:17.358 --> 05:18.568
(quietly):
Right.

05:20.987 --> 05:24.198
His mind: blown.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.036

you were there ♪

05:32.123 --> 05:35.251

05:35.334 --> 05:36.836
Who the hell is that guy?

05:37.837 --> 05:38.963
As if you don't know.

05:39.047 --> 05:40.048
I-I really don't.

05:40.131 --> 05:42.884
You're such a philistine.
That's Rod Connaughton.

05:44.052 --> 05:45.470
From Sachet.

05:45.553 --> 05:46.888
Not a clue.

05:46.971 --> 05:48.097
But I'm curious,
what has led you

05:48.181 --> 05:51.267
to this particularly unpleasant
corner of the Internet?

05:52.560 --> 05:55.438
Okay, how do I say this?

05:55.521 --> 05:58.107
Part of my past
came back into my life today.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.942
But I don't want you to worry.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.277
So you banged him.

06:01.360 --> 06:03.404
I was trying
to ease you into it,

06:03.488 --> 06:05.073
but yes. A long time ago.

06:05.156 --> 06:06.324
(chuckles):
Okay.

06:06.407 --> 06:08.493
So, in the spirit
of crystal clarity,

06:08.576 --> 06:09.911
I slept with a rock star.

06:09.994 --> 06:11.788
Uh, David Bowie's a rock star.

06:11.871 --> 06:15.249
This guy sprays cologne
on your face at JCPenney.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.960
Aw, is somebody jealous?

06:18.044 --> 06:19.629
(chuckles):
No.

06:19.712 --> 06:21.297
We both
came into this relationship

06:21.380 --> 06:23.925
knowing we had a past.

06:24.008 --> 06:27.637
Uh, mine happens to be
a little more vivid, but yes.

06:24.008 --> 06:27.637
(grunts)

06:27.720 --> 06:31.432
(sighs) Bonnie, I was a
stuntman for 28 years.

06:31.516 --> 06:33.810
There comes a point
on every movie set

06:33.893 --> 06:36.646
where the lead actress is
upset with the director,

06:36.729 --> 06:38.147
isn't talking to
her leading man,

06:38.231 --> 06:39.982
is divorcing her
third husband,

06:40.066 --> 06:42.360
and has been on a
liquid diet for a month.

06:42.443 --> 06:44.320
And guess who's over there,

06:44.403 --> 06:48.574
limbering up against a Camaro,
ready to light her cigarette?

06:48.658 --> 06:50.159
(scoffs)
Let's go to bed.

06:50.243 --> 06:53.204
Funny, that's exactly
what Tanya Roberts said.

06:53.287 --> 06:56.624
(scoffs) In what universe
is Tanya Roberts a movie star?

06:56.707 --> 06:59.377
(laughs): The same one
where that yahoo's a rock star.

06:59.460 --> 07:03.297
Also, the girl from WKRP
who wasn't Loni Anderson.

07:03.381 --> 07:05.049
Good night.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.179
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

07:10.263 --> 07:13.474
Classic 36 inches.

07:13.558 --> 07:16.978
Okay, oven, what do you got?

07:17.061 --> 07:19.063
Let's see.

07:21.107 --> 07:22.441
Damn it!

07:24.110 --> 07:25.361
Hey, Tammy.

07:25.444 --> 07:27.697
Hey, buddy. Listen,

07:27.780 --> 07:29.907
when you get up in the morning
and you want to think about,

07:29.991 --> 07:31.659
I don't know,
hockey or something,

07:31.742 --> 07:33.578
which side of the table
do you sit on?

07:33.661 --> 07:36.164
That one. What exactly
is happening here?

07:36.247 --> 07:38.916
Mm. I'm more than just
a licensed handyman, Adam.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.085
I'm a licensed
handyman with empathy.

07:41.169 --> 07:43.045
See, if I'm gonna design
a kitchen,

07:43.129 --> 07:45.047
I got to see it
from your perspective.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.549
Oh! While Bonnie's not here,

07:46.632 --> 07:48.050
can you raid the cereal cabinet
for me?

07:48.134 --> 07:49.343
Oh, sure thing.

07:49.427 --> 07:52.180
Dang, you eat cereal
like I used to pop pills.

07:56.184 --> 07:58.895
Oh. Oh! I can't reach it.

07:58.978 --> 08:01.939
Tammy, you could still stand.

08:02.023 --> 08:04.192
Oh, yeah. Good call.

08:04.275 --> 08:05.902
All right. Let's
see, what do we got?

08:05.985 --> 08:07.445
Ooh, Golden Grahams?

08:05.985 --> 08:07.445
Yeah.

08:07.528 --> 08:09.238
(chuckles):
All right.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.365
Oh, dude,
that's not the kitchen's fault.

08:16.287 --> 08:17.622
Hi.

08:18.623 --> 08:19.707
Oh, hi.

08:19.790 --> 08:22.293
Look what still fits
after 30 years.

08:22.376 --> 08:25.630
(chuckles):
Oh, right. Right.

08:22.376 --> 08:25.630
(chuckles)

08:25.713 --> 08:27.381
Where do you want me
to sign, love?

08:27.465 --> 08:29.091
Oh, I don't want
your autograph, Rod.

08:29.175 --> 08:30.468
Oh, a selfie, then?

08:30.551 --> 08:31.636
A-Are you kidding?

08:31.719 --> 08:33.763
It's me, Bonnie Plunkett.

08:33.846 --> 08:35.473
Okay.

08:35.556 --> 08:37.558
I understand, it's
been a long time.

08:37.642 --> 08:39.268
Let me refresh your memory.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.896
Fargo Ballroom, 1987.

08:43.522 --> 08:44.941
Radisson Hotel.

08:46.275 --> 08:47.652
Ice machine at the
Radisson Hotel.

08:47.735 --> 08:51.113
(laughs):
Oh! Oh!

08:47.735 --> 08:51.113
(chuckles): Hey! Yes.

08:51.197 --> 08:52.406
Hello.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.325
Oh, I must apologize.
The '80s are gone.

08:54.408 --> 08:57.578
Just washed away on a sea
of quaaludes and cognac.

08:57.662 --> 09:00.623
But you got to remember me.
We had something real.

09:00.706 --> 09:02.917
You even said I was
more than a groupie.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.418
Well, that's what you say
to groupies, you know.

09:04.502 --> 09:06.629
That's how you get a groupie.

09:06.712 --> 09:09.423
I bet I even played the piano
for you.

09:09.507 --> 09:12.134
You did. Because you were
writing a song just for...

09:13.344 --> 09:14.303
Oh, my God.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.973
(laughs)
Classic Rod.

09:18.015 --> 09:20.559
I might not remember
the '80s,

09:20.643 --> 09:22.311
but I'm still apologizing
for 'em.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.312
Anyway, I can still sign
your T-shirt.

09:23.396 --> 09:26.065
Oh, for God's sake, Rod,
put away your Sharpie!

18:02.539 --> 18:05.375
and look at that state fair
audience and live a lie.

18:05.459 --> 18:07.002
Uh... okay, calm down.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.837
Do-do you have anyone
to talk to about this?

18:08.921 --> 18:10.506
Well, I used to talk
to Rod Stewart,

18:10.589 --> 18:11.882
but he's gone a bit squishy

18:11.965 --> 18:14.301
since he did
that Christmas album.

18:14.384 --> 18:16.136
What about your sponsor?

18:16.220 --> 18:18.305
I-I don't have one.

18:18.388 --> 18:21.183
Ah. There's your problem.

18:22.267 --> 18:24.061
Putting the drink down is huge,

18:24.144 --> 18:26.355
but it's just one part
of being sober.

18:26.438 --> 18:28.398
The rest is about
the thinking.

18:28.482 --> 18:30.567
The things that go on
between our ears.

18:30.651 --> 18:32.611
And if you're not dealing
with that,

18:32.694 --> 18:34.738
you're basically
white-knuckling your sobriety.

18:34.822 --> 18:36.865
And I get it, because
I've been there.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.033
And today's a perfect example.

18:38.116 --> 18:41.036
If I didn't have a sponsor,
I wouldn't have come here.

18:41.119 --> 18:43.497
Well, for what it's worth,
I'm glad you did.

18:43.580 --> 18:44.873
So am I.

18:44.957 --> 18:47.918
I think that leads
to the next obvious question.

18:48.001 --> 18:49.503
Mm, Rod.
(chuckles)

18:49.586 --> 18:53.048
I'm happily married--
I can't go on tour with you.

18:53.131 --> 18:55.551
Oh, no, no.
I want you to be my sponsor.

18:55.634 --> 18:57.427
Oh. Oh.

18:57.511 --> 19:01.765
Well, I have a lot of people
under my wing right now.

19:01.849 --> 19:05.018
But none of them
ever opened for Wham!

19:06.645 --> 19:08.564
Thank you. Thank you.

19:08.647 --> 19:11.900
And I... I really am very sorry
that I didn't remember you.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.944
Which brings me to something
that's been haunting me

19:14.027 --> 19:15.946
ever since you mentioned
the drummer.

19:16.029 --> 19:18.740
Liam?

19:16.029 --> 19:18.740
Liam.

19:18.824 --> 19:20.951
I'm starting to think
it was Liam.

19:21.034 --> 19:22.619
♪ ♪

19:27.207 --> 19:28.876
All right, come on in, buddy.

19:28.959 --> 19:30.127
Ah.

19:31.879 --> 19:33.255
(laughs):
I'm so sorry, but...

19:33.338 --> 19:35.257
I'm not really seeing
what's different.

19:35.340 --> 19:37.259
Well, there was one thing
I figured I could do

19:37.342 --> 19:38.427
without a permit.

19:40.596 --> 19:41.805
Voilà!

19:41.889 --> 19:44.308
(laughs):
Oh, that's fantastic!

19:44.391 --> 19:46.101
I love it! That's great!

19:46.184 --> 19:47.561
Now you can reach
everything.

19:47.644 --> 19:49.313
The condiments,
the spices...

19:49.396 --> 19:51.273
We have Nutella?

19:51.356 --> 19:52.357
Tammy...

19:52.441 --> 19:53.525
you're the best.

19:53.609 --> 19:54.610
Agreed.

19:54.693 --> 19:56.153
All right,
now I got to take off.

19:56.236 --> 19:57.362
Okay.
Oh, there's one more thing.

19:57.446 --> 19:58.822
Can you look at it for me?
Real quick.

19:58.906 --> 20:00.449
Sure.

19:58.906 --> 20:00.449
Something's
going on

20:00.532 --> 20:03.493
with that drawer to
the left of the sink.

20:03.577 --> 20:05.287
It seems fine.

20:05.370 --> 20:06.914
Hey, what is this?

20:08.957 --> 20:11.877
That is
a Cinderella princess crown.

20:12.711 --> 20:14.671
I bought it for you.
I didn't have one.

20:18.258 --> 20:19.968
You have my back; I have yours.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.970
Suck on that, Donna Schroder.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.639
(both laugh)
