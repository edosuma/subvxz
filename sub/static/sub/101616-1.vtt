WEBVTT

02:09.613 --> 02:10.614
<i>Jenny.</i>

02:29.033 --> 02:30.567
Told you this was gonna happen

02:30.600 --> 02:32.569
if you hire an intern
outside of the department.

02:32.602 --> 02:34.071
You told her what time
we had to leave, right?

02:34.105 --> 02:36.808
I told her, but, you
know, she's probably hung over.

02:36.841 --> 02:39.376
She went out last night
to a bar, um,

02:39.409 --> 02:41.712
called "Leelu's," or "Lanos,"
or...

02:41.746 --> 02:42.980
Or a "Leao," Grant.

02:43.014 --> 02:44.514
But it's nice to know

02:44.548 --> 02:46.349
you're tracking my movements.
Good morning.

02:46.383 --> 02:47.852
Um, I told you 7:15, right?

02:47.885 --> 02:50.655
It's 7:30, and here I am.

02:52.455 --> 02:53.925
- What does this do?
- Don't touch it.

02:53.958 --> 02:55.425
- I just said...
- Why don't you guys go get

02:55.458 --> 02:56.593
some breakfast on the way
to the marina?

02:59.130 --> 03:00.530
You go, too, Grant.
I got this stuff.

03:01.431 --> 03:02.566
- Really?
- Thanks. Yeah.

03:02.599 --> 03:04.534
Okay. Uh...

03:04.568 --> 03:05.602
See you in, like,
20 minutes?

03:05.635 --> 03:08.773
- Yeah, I will see you there.
- Okay. Uh...

03:08.806 --> 03:09.941
good luck.

04:10.768 --> 04:12.737
- You're late.
- Hi. Yeah. Sorry,

04:12.770 --> 04:14.839
but I did stop at this amazing
antique store

04:14.872 --> 04:17.041
and I got this beautiful map
of the Azores.

04:17.074 --> 04:18.642
But we're so
ahead of schedule,

04:18.676 --> 04:20.911
I mean, this guy's boat
is really fast, so...

04:20.945 --> 04:23.915
It goes, like, 35 knots
on a good day.

04:23.948 --> 04:25.883
So I've been giving this
a lot of thought, Rachel.

04:25.917 --> 04:27.251
And I really think

04:27.285 --> 04:30.121
that the university is falling
over themselves to kiss your ass.

04:30.154 --> 04:31.222
Sounds like
someone I know.

04:31.255 --> 04:32.790
Um...

04:34.158 --> 04:35.492
I got you something.

04:40.064 --> 04:41.065
Here.

04:42.233 --> 04:43.801
It's St. Anthony.

04:43.834 --> 04:46.103
He's the patron saint
of lost things

04:46.137 --> 04:47.637
and missing persons.

04:47.672 --> 04:50.640
- He's from Padua really...
- You don't actually believe this stuff, do you?

04:50.675 --> 04:52.076
...but he was raised
in Lisbon.

04:52.475 --> 04:54.511
No, I mean...

04:54.544 --> 04:56.613
Come on, it's like
a good luck thing.

04:56.646 --> 04:58.916
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves, all right?

04:58.950 --> 05:00.550
Let's get out there,
gather our data,

05:00.583 --> 05:01.752
and bring it home
to analyze, yeah?

05:01.786 --> 05:02.954
Yeah, of course.
It's what I was gonna do.

05:02.987 --> 05:04.121
Great.

05:06.924 --> 05:08.659
It's so endearing when you try.

05:09.193 --> 05:10.795
- Is it?
- No.

05:14.098 --> 05:16.267
On the <i>Mary's</i> most
previous voyages,

05:16.300 --> 05:17.835
they were shipping
copious amounts of coal.

05:17.868 --> 05:18.970
Now the remnants
of that coal

05:19.003 --> 05:20.771
- combined with the fact that they just...
- Grant.

05:23.674 --> 05:24.775
Oh, my God.

05:24.809 --> 05:26.509
Son of a bitch!

05:26.543 --> 05:27.812
It's supposed
to be right here.

05:27.845 --> 05:29.280
You're looking
for Nunes?

05:29.313 --> 05:30.881
Yeah, we are.

05:30.915 --> 05:32.283
He took off
earlier this morning.

05:32.316 --> 05:33.583
Well, is he coming back?

05:35.585 --> 05:36.586
I don't know.

05:37.554 --> 05:39.556
God damn it!

05:39.589 --> 05:40.623
Hey, I'm still gonna
get credit, right?

05:40.658 --> 05:42.827
How was I supposed to know
the guy was skittish?

05:42.860 --> 05:44.095
You're supposed
to know everything.

05:44.128 --> 05:45.696
Know any other boats
for hire?

05:45.730 --> 05:47.765
If you're looking
for a sightseeing tours,

05:47.798 --> 05:49.266
you're on the wrong part
of the island.

05:49.300 --> 05:51.235
Ponta Delgada
would be your best bet.

05:51.268 --> 05:52.737
I need to leave within the hour.

05:54.305 --> 05:56.941
- What's your rush?
- So you do know of somebody.

06:05.016 --> 06:06.250
<i>Hola,</i> Miguel.

06:27.805 --> 06:30.041
Uh, no.

06:30.074 --> 06:31.876
I'm restoring her myself.

06:33.944 --> 06:36.247
- She'll get you where you need to go.
- Really?

06:36.280 --> 06:37.948
'Cause, I mean,
what's her top speed?

06:37.982 --> 06:39.649
- 'Cause we need to go at least...
- Grant.

06:41.085 --> 06:42.619
Good luck to you then.

06:44.388 --> 06:45.923
Seriously? Right now?

06:45.956 --> 06:47.892
He was rude.

06:47.925 --> 06:49.693
Well, I'm not getting
in people's way.

06:53.064 --> 06:55.099
I don't need a headache
like that.

06:56.767 --> 06:57.802
There.

07:03.340 --> 07:04.574
Hi.

07:08.012 --> 07:09.346
Look, I'm really sorry.

07:09.380 --> 07:11.248
Look, Grant didn't mean it.

07:11.282 --> 07:14.685
He's just... He's not the most
eloquent guy in the world.

07:14.718 --> 07:15.719
Yeah, well...

07:19.256 --> 07:20.858
So where in the States
are you from?

07:20.891 --> 07:22.059
You wouldn't know it.

07:23.327 --> 07:24.462
Look, I need a boat.

07:24.495 --> 07:26.864
It's a time issue at this point,
and if you help me out,

07:26.897 --> 07:29.366
I will make it
worth your while.

07:29.400 --> 07:31.235
It's quite a hefty bag
you're carrying there, Miss.

07:31.268 --> 07:32.903
- Simmons. But...
- Simmons.

07:33.404 --> 07:35.372
Call me Rachel.

07:35.406 --> 07:38.709
It's just camera and sound equipment.
It's nothing too heavy.

07:38.742 --> 07:39.910
I'm here on research.

07:39.944 --> 07:41.846
Grant and Cassandra
are my assistants.

07:41.879 --> 07:43.280
Field trip?

07:43.314 --> 07:44.949
Something like that, yeah.

07:46.350 --> 07:48.319
So why was Nunes so spooked?

07:48.618 --> 07:49.820
Was he?

07:51.222 --> 07:53.023
Whatever you're paying,

07:53.057 --> 07:56.093
I'm not about to
risk my vessel.

07:56.127 --> 07:58.262
So level with me,
or go home.

08:00.865 --> 08:01.866
Fair enough.

08:03.968 --> 08:05.769
Are you familiar with
the story of the <i>Mary Celeste?</i>

08:14.478 --> 08:16.247
Okay, you think you are,

08:16.280 --> 08:18.182
but listen to this.
You know,

08:18.215 --> 08:21.285
she was an American vessel
en route to Genoa

08:21.318 --> 08:24.021
about 140 years ago.

08:24.054 --> 08:26.190
Now, the last entry we have
on the captain's log

08:26.223 --> 08:29.260
was on 25th of November.
And it put him right here,

08:29.293 --> 08:31.662
36 degrees North
by 25 degrees West.

08:32.229 --> 08:33.330
This...

08:36.299 --> 08:38.202
is Captain Benjamin Briggs.

08:40.738 --> 08:42.673
This is his wife, Sarah...

08:44.975 --> 08:46.410
and their daughter, Sophia.

08:49.747 --> 08:52.249
Now, there were no signs
of a struggle on board.

08:52.283 --> 08:54.885
All the other ships in the area
reported smooth sailing.

08:54.919 --> 08:56.487
And Briggs was
an experienced seaman.

08:56.520 --> 08:58.055
He thought he had nothing
to worry about.

08:58.088 --> 09:01.025
But all of these people...

09:01.058 --> 09:04.929
It's the most famous missing
persons case in maritime history,

09:04.962 --> 09:07.731
and not one theory has held up.

09:07.765 --> 09:10.267
A storm swept all aboard
into the ocean,

09:10.301 --> 09:12.736
a Victorian era
insurance scam,

09:12.770 --> 09:14.772
fucking alien abduction,

09:14.805 --> 09:16.740
I have been over all of it.

09:16.774 --> 09:18.275
And you need a boat for what?

09:19.877 --> 09:22.813
To get a look at the area,
and take some readings.

09:22.846 --> 09:24.381
Atmospheric changes,
temperature,

09:24.415 --> 09:26.884
- any kind of electromagnetic anomalies.
- Mmm-hmm.

09:27.384 --> 09:28.385
Look...

09:29.320 --> 09:30.821
I'm not some crackpot

09:30.854 --> 09:33.023
with a website and too much time
on my hands.

09:33.057 --> 09:34.358
This is real science.

09:35.192 --> 09:37.027
And if you help me out,

09:37.061 --> 09:38.996
you could be part
of a major discovery.

09:40.798 --> 09:43.334
Miss Simmons, I'm only
interested in two things.

09:43.367 --> 09:45.069
The safety of my passengers,

09:45.102 --> 09:46.904
and the safety of my vessel.

09:50.507 --> 09:53.043
Can I interest you in a third?

09:59.850 --> 10:00.851
Hey.

10:02.019 --> 10:03.020
Hand me the case.

10:11.095 --> 10:12.196
Okay.

10:19.837 --> 10:20.838
Oh.

10:33.150 --> 10:34.151
Hello.

10:35.219 --> 10:37.154
Aldo, pull the ropes.

10:39.957 --> 10:42.026
Don't worry about this.
We'll start working on it on the way out.

10:42.059 --> 10:43.260
Come on.

10:44.261 --> 10:46.363
He don't speak English
and I don't speak Farsi,

10:46.397 --> 10:47.865
but it works for us.

11:51.995 --> 11:52.996
Shit!

12:56.126 --> 12:57.127
Excuse me.

12:59.463 --> 13:00.597
Sorry, man.

13:00.631 --> 13:03.100
Just... Um...

13:03.133 --> 13:05.068
Look, most of this stuff,

13:05.102 --> 13:07.705
most people don't know,
was actually on the <i>Mary Celeste.</i>

13:23.220 --> 13:24.656
<i>What's your theory?</i>

13:24.689 --> 13:26.423
Huh?

13:26.457 --> 13:27.524
About the <i>Mary Celeste.</i>

13:27.558 --> 13:29.560
You said everybody's got one.
What's your theory?

13:31.128 --> 13:32.396
Do you really
wanna hear it?

13:36.567 --> 13:38.101
Okay.

13:38.135 --> 13:39.203
I'll be right back.

13:47.110 --> 13:48.111
All right.

13:49.413 --> 13:50.414
Okay.

13:50.849 --> 13:53.417
Watch... this.

14:09.199 --> 14:10.400
Look.

14:17.775 --> 14:18.776
What was that?

14:20.344 --> 14:22.513
Eight fishermen saw
that bird disappear.

14:25.750 --> 14:28.352
I think that there are places
on this planet

14:28.385 --> 14:30.521
where every once in a while,

14:30.554 --> 14:33.323
there's a tear,
or a rift that happens

14:33.357 --> 14:36.193
when the tectonic plates shift,
and there's a vent...

14:39.563 --> 14:42.332
All right, you've shot
a gun, right?

14:42.366 --> 14:44.669
When you shoot a gun,
there's a vacuum effect

14:44.702 --> 14:46.603
that gets created when the
bullet leaves the chamber.

14:46.637 --> 14:47.839
It's called blow back.

14:47.872 --> 14:50.374
All right? That's how they trace
DNA back from a crime scene.

14:50.407 --> 14:51.441
So?

14:51.475 --> 14:54.444
So, that blow back pulls
trace amounts of material

14:54.478 --> 14:57.247
from the environment
back inside the barrel.

14:57.281 --> 15:00.150
I think that that's what happened
to everyone on the <i>Mary Celeste.</i>

15:01.218 --> 15:02.687
Just... stay with me.

15:05.222 --> 15:07.224
All right.

15:07.257 --> 15:11.128
The Azores are on top of one of the
most active fault lines on the planet.

15:11.161 --> 15:12.462
When those
tectonic plates shift,

15:12.496 --> 15:14.364
it's like a gunshot

15:14.398 --> 15:16.433
and the bullet is the pressure
that's released.

15:16.466 --> 15:17.869
It's catastrophic,

15:17.902 --> 15:19.636
the climate changes,
the tides shift,

15:19.671 --> 15:21.405
the magnetic belts are in flux,

15:21.438 --> 15:23.507
and a rift will feed off
of that energy.

15:23.540 --> 15:25.509
The rift, in this case,
is our blow back.

15:26.276 --> 15:28.111
Everyone onboard
the <i>Mary Celeste</i>

15:28.145 --> 15:29.513
got pulled into
one of those rifts.

15:29.546 --> 15:31.582
Now, I've been charting it.

15:31.615 --> 15:33.450
Tonight, finally,
I know that it's...

15:33.483 --> 15:34.919
Miss Simmons.

15:34.953 --> 15:37.487
All right, you know what? This isn't
the only time that it's happened.

15:37.521 --> 15:40.390
Five years ago, the <i>Kaz II</i> was found
drifting off the coast of Australia...

15:40.424 --> 15:41.458
Jesus!

15:41.491 --> 15:42.827
- October 1917...
- Miss Simmons!

15:47.331 --> 15:48.498
Jesus!

15:48.532 --> 15:49.734
Do you believe me?

15:49.767 --> 15:52.169
If I did I'd be
turning the boat around.

15:59.877 --> 16:01.411
I should go back downstairs.

17:46.483 --> 17:47.652
<i>Ten...</i>

17:47.685 --> 17:48.686
<i>Nine...</i>

17:49.821 --> 17:50.822
<i>Eight...</i>

17:51.789 --> 17:52.790
<i>Seven...</i>

17:53.590 --> 17:54.591
<i>Six...</i>

17:56.493 --> 17:57.494
<i>Five...</i>

17:59.396 --> 18:00.397
<i>Four...</i>

18:00.965 --> 18:01.966
<i>Three...</i>

18:03.034 --> 18:04.234
<i>Two...</i>

18:05.703 --> 18:06.704
<i>One.</i>

18:08.538 --> 18:09.774
<i>Here it comes!</i>

18:29.093 --> 18:30.293
Fine.

18:33.731 --> 18:34.732
Hey.

18:36.399 --> 18:37.467
Are you all right?

18:41.571 --> 18:42.639
Yeah.

18:47.845 --> 18:49.046
What happened?
Why'd we stop?

18:49.080 --> 18:50.982
Settle down, we're checking
on the problem.

18:51.015 --> 18:52.349
They don't know.

18:52.382 --> 18:55.953
Aldo and I rebuilt these engines ourselves.
I'm sure it's nothing.

18:55.987 --> 18:57.688
Do you want me
to take a look?

18:57.722 --> 18:58.990
I mean, I know little...

19:00.792 --> 19:02.526
Oil pressure looks right.

19:02.559 --> 19:04.461
Tulls, you told me she'd get me
where I needed to go.

19:06.063 --> 19:07.430
Where do you think you are?

19:14.839 --> 19:16.606
Shit. Start setting up.
Come on.

19:18.408 --> 19:20.912
<i>Marianna,</i> this is the <i>Allegro.</i>
We just lost both engines.

19:20.945 --> 19:22.713
Wait, wait.
What are you doing?

19:22.747 --> 19:25.649
I can't have passengers on board
when we've lost both engines.

19:25.683 --> 19:26.984
But he's working on it.
He said it was nothing.

19:27.785 --> 19:29.020
You got an hour.

19:29.053 --> 19:30.587
I need more time than that.

19:30.620 --> 19:32.790
I could lose my license
if I don't call this in.

19:32.824 --> 19:34.424
I've never
heard of that.

19:34.457 --> 19:36.027
Nobody needs
to find out.

19:36.060 --> 19:38.830
They'll drop you
at Ponta Delgada.

19:38.863 --> 19:40.865
You can hire another vessel
there and come back tomorrow.

19:40.898 --> 19:43.734
Tomorrow's too late.
All of the data points to a shift tonight.

19:46.003 --> 19:47.972
- I'll pay you another 500.
- Rachel!

19:48.973 --> 19:50.407
- Three thousand.
- Whoa!

19:50.440 --> 19:52.442
- Are you crazy?
- One thousand.

19:52.475 --> 19:53.476
Two.

19:57.949 --> 20:00.151
Now this is where
you say 1,500.

20:03.420 --> 20:04.487
Done.

20:05.589 --> 20:06.858
<i>Marianna,</i> cancel that.

20:06.891 --> 20:09.026
Looks like we found a solution.

20:09.060 --> 20:10.393
You've got till dawn.

20:13.097 --> 20:14.799
Come on.

20:30.547 --> 20:32.717
Don't give me that look.

20:33.985 --> 20:35.186
That was bullshit.

20:35.219 --> 20:37.889
Stay focused,
get those cameras set up, all right?

20:42.459 --> 20:43.493
Got it?

20:44.829 --> 20:47.098
Looks like
we're not drifting too much.

20:47.131 --> 20:48.733
As long as the current
doesn't pick up,

20:48.766 --> 20:50.467
we should be fine
for the next couple of hours.

20:50.500 --> 20:51.534
Great.

20:51.568 --> 20:52.904
Hey, Rachel?

20:54.171 --> 20:56.073
Something's gonna
happen tonight.

20:56.107 --> 20:57.141
I can feel it.

20:58.508 --> 20:59.509
Me too.

21:20.765 --> 21:21.966
Infrared's up.

22:28.032 --> 22:29.033
Whoa...

22:33.170 --> 22:34.171
guys.

22:38.709 --> 22:39.710
Here.

22:40.878 --> 22:41.979
I like it, man.
It's cool.

22:48.252 --> 22:49.619
How do you live out here, man?

22:51.155 --> 22:52.156
I couldn't do it.

22:53.958 --> 22:56.027
It's too fucking quiet,
you know.

23:30.094 --> 23:32.029
Hi.

23:32.063 --> 23:35.099
I'm, uh, measuring
the changes in...

23:35.132 --> 23:36.934
electro-magnetic atmosphere.

23:37.768 --> 23:39.937
Usually in one
of these rifts there's

23:39.970 --> 23:41.305
physical change that happens.

23:43.741 --> 23:45.910
You don't care, do you?

23:45.943 --> 23:47.778
You ever been
in one of these rifts?

23:49.080 --> 23:51.682
Uh, no.

23:51.715 --> 23:53.884
How the hell do you know
what happens then?

23:58.055 --> 24:00.891
Captain Tulls, I...

24:00.925 --> 24:04.028
I don't expect you to believe
any of this.

24:04.061 --> 24:06.063
You know,
I didn't at first either.

24:06.864 --> 24:07.865
And now?

24:10.401 --> 24:11.601
I believe in science.

24:24.248 --> 24:25.816
It happens.

24:26.817 --> 24:27.918
Yeah.

25:07.491 --> 25:08.692
<i>Hello.</i>

25:09.226 --> 25:10.394
<i>Did you find anything?</i>

25:11.028 --> 25:12.329
<i>Not yet.</i>

25:12.363 --> 25:13.764
<i>Oh...</i>

25:15.266 --> 25:16.967
<i>Did you get something?</i>

25:17.001 --> 25:20.838
<i>Stop. Look, please,
make yourself useful, okay?</i>

25:20.871 --> 25:22.373
<i>Just... You know
what this is?</i>

25:22.406 --> 25:26.210
<i>This looks like
a bullshit-o-meter.</i>

25:26.243 --> 25:27.411
<i>No.</i>

25:27.444 --> 25:30.381
If the wand moves, tell me.

25:30.414 --> 25:32.917
- Okay. Yes, sir.
- Okay, that's all you have to do.

25:32.950 --> 25:35.953
<i>Please, just try not
to break it, okay?</i>

25:35.986 --> 25:37.454
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>
- <i>Thank you.</i>

25:41.125 --> 25:42.426
Thank you.

27:44.415 --> 27:45.416
Jesus.

29:54.044 --> 29:55.045
Grant, did you hear that?

29:56.346 --> 29:58.015
Grant?

30:08.525 --> 30:09.993
Aldo.

30:13.630 --> 30:16.033
Aldo? Oh, shit!

30:16.066 --> 30:17.434
Hey! Somebody help me.

30:17.468 --> 30:19.403
Come on, give me a hand.

30:19.436 --> 30:21.405
- Come on
- RACHEL: Watch his head. Careful.

30:28.612 --> 30:30.715
- Grab the first aid kit.
- Okay, where's it?

30:30.748 --> 30:32.182
- It's up there in the wheelhouse.
- Where?

30:32.216 --> 30:34.551
Wheelhouse. Right there!
Right there!

30:34.585 --> 30:36.220
Aldo, Aldo!

30:37.722 --> 30:39.289
I got it.

30:39.323 --> 30:41.058
- Here.
- Shit.

30:58.810 --> 31:00.010
Shit.

31:03.681 --> 31:05.115
Fuck.

31:05.148 --> 31:06.617
We're going home.
Move, move.

31:06.650 --> 31:07.785
- Wait, what?
- We're getting out of here.

31:07.819 --> 31:10.487
Tulls... No, we can't!

31:14.191 --> 31:15.592
Fuck me.

31:20.097 --> 31:23.267
Can we just stop for
a moment and think rationally?

31:23.300 --> 31:24.401
Let's have a clear head
about this, okay?

31:24.434 --> 31:27.237
Tulls, Aldo is going to be fine.
Will you just, please...

31:27.271 --> 31:28.806
- What are you doing?
- What the hell do you think? The engines are dead.

31:28.840 --> 31:31.542
- I thought the engines were already dead.
- Damn it!

31:31.575 --> 31:34.244
- What the fuck is going on?
- Why are you trying to start her?

31:35.847 --> 31:38.081
Come on. Come on,
help me move these boards.

31:38.115 --> 31:40.651
No. No! No, Grant, no!
We're not doing anything.

31:40.685 --> 31:43.453
No, damn it!

31:43.487 --> 31:45.422
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Tulls...

31:47.257 --> 31:49.259
- Damn it.
- Tulls, what is going on here?

31:50.427 --> 31:52.162
He's ripping you off, Rachel.

31:52.195 --> 31:54.298
- The engines are fine.
- Jesus Christ.

31:55.365 --> 31:56.366
You think I cut the oil line?

31:58.135 --> 31:59.469
Move, move.

31:59.503 --> 32:01.104
He's a fucking
scam artist.

32:01.138 --> 32:03.808
You do not know who the hell
you are talking to.

32:03.841 --> 32:05.409
Keep your damn mouth shut.

32:05.442 --> 32:07.644
Come on, come on.
Come on!

32:07.679 --> 32:08.846
All right, you know what?
We're wasting time.

32:08.880 --> 32:10.647
Let's go.

32:11.783 --> 32:13.517
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.

32:13.550 --> 32:14.786
This is the <i>Allegro.</i>

32:14.819 --> 32:16.620
We've lost all engines.

32:16.654 --> 32:19.323
Mayday, Mayday...
Damn it.

32:24.796 --> 32:26.363
I got
the sound equipment.

32:28.866 --> 32:31.368
Really? He's nuts, Rachel.

32:31.401 --> 32:34.171
You got an injured guy there, and you
wanna break out the sound equipment?

32:34.204 --> 32:36.306
We gotta do what we can before
the rescue boat gets here.

32:36.340 --> 32:38.508
Something is happening,
and I'm not about to miss it...

32:38.542 --> 32:40.678
He is scamming you.

32:40.712 --> 32:42.479
What happens when
the money runs out, Rachel?

32:43.380 --> 32:45.415
What is he gonna take next?

32:45.449 --> 32:46.684
You don't know
what can happen out here.

32:46.718 --> 32:48.118
We can all disappear
real fucking fast.

32:48.151 --> 32:50.354
All right, you wanna sit in the
corner and speculate, that's fine...

32:50.387 --> 32:51.521
- She has a point.
- Which is?

32:52.857 --> 32:54.491
We don't know
who this guy is.

32:54.524 --> 32:56.226
I say we come back next year

32:56.259 --> 32:57.762
with more money,
a bigger boat,

32:57.795 --> 33:00.130
- a bigger crew...
- The money is gone.

33:05.235 --> 33:07.537
The plane tickets,
hotels, equipment...

33:07.571 --> 33:09.339
This is it.

33:09.373 --> 33:10.875
There's no coming back
next year.

33:12.944 --> 33:15.780
I should've taken that fucking
glass blowing class.

33:18.816 --> 33:21.218
I'll do it myself.

33:26.924 --> 33:27.925
Grant.

33:36.633 --> 33:37.835
Why didn't you tell me?

33:37.869 --> 33:39.837
It's not your job
to worry about it.

33:41.005 --> 33:42.205
Rachel.

33:46.643 --> 33:48.512
I need to find something, Grant.

33:49.914 --> 33:50.915
Anything.

34:02.026 --> 34:03.493
I'll man the recorder.

35:33.785 --> 35:34.786
Hold on.

35:43.560 --> 35:44.896
We are rolling.

37:16.954 --> 37:18.656
Grant, do you hear that?

37:20.590 --> 37:22.559
Grant?

37:32.169 --> 37:34.571
Grant, what are you doing?
I need you on headset.

37:35.840 --> 37:36.841
What?

37:36.874 --> 37:39.442
Come here,
come here, come here.

37:48.585 --> 37:50.955
Wait... Jesus Christ,
we're not recording this.

37:50.988 --> 37:53.590
- All right, I'll...
- Oh, no, no, no, I got it. I got it.

37:53.623 --> 37:56.027
You keep recording
in the shower, okay?

37:56.060 --> 37:57.527
I heard something in there.

38:05.136 --> 38:06.603
Jesus Christ.

38:44.008 --> 38:45.542
Oh, hell, no!

38:47.678 --> 38:49.947
- No, no, no!
- No, no, no, wait, wait!

38:49.981 --> 38:51.548
No engine means
no generator

38:51.581 --> 38:52.984
which means we're
running on battery power.

38:53.017 --> 38:54.551
Please do not touch anything.
Please.

38:54.584 --> 38:56.721
If the battery dies,
we lose radio and GPS.

38:56.754 --> 38:57.755
Everything!

38:58.923 --> 39:00.557
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

39:00.590 --> 39:02.293
I promise you I will...

39:02.326 --> 39:04.996
Just... Excuse me.

39:11.736 --> 39:12.837
Here, help.

39:12.870 --> 39:14.138
What the hell is this?

39:14.171 --> 39:15.806
- It's a battery. Replace it.
- What?

39:19.043 --> 39:23.047
You ever found anything
with all this bullshit here?

39:23.080 --> 39:24.949
Four hundred pounds
of crap and all it's doing is

39:24.982 --> 39:26.884
- scratching up my boat.
- No, don't...

39:28.252 --> 39:29.820
Oh, shit.

39:59.250 --> 40:00.317
The <i>Marianna.</i>

40:07.925 --> 40:10.661
I need more time.

40:10.694 --> 40:12.096
Tulls, you saw what's happening.

40:13.064 --> 40:15.166
Come on.

40:15.199 --> 40:16.867
Be the guy
that gives me a break.

40:25.943 --> 40:28.045
That can't be the <i>Marianna.</i>

40:28.813 --> 40:30.081
Why not?

40:31.082 --> 40:32.917
She's coming at us too fast.

40:56.407 --> 40:58.608
<i>I see you, Mommy.</i>

41:02.746 --> 41:04.248
<i>Do you see me?</i>

42:08.145 --> 42:09.713
Is it still coming?

42:10.948 --> 42:11.982
Yeah.

42:12.016 --> 42:13.217
What direction?

42:18.956 --> 42:20.357
It's on top of us.

42:40.511 --> 42:41.845
Hey.

42:42.980 --> 42:44.315
What's going on?

42:46.850 --> 42:48.052
Hello?

43:23.087 --> 43:24.255
No.

43:35.032 --> 43:36.166
Rachel?

43:42.406 --> 43:43.807
Rachel?

43:46.243 --> 43:47.544
Rachel?

43:48.479 --> 43:50.147
Rachel?

43:50.180 --> 43:51.348
Rachel?

43:54.184 --> 43:56.854
Here, make yourself useful.

44:02.559 --> 44:03.961
Where's Aldo?

44:06.630 --> 44:08.399
Come on. Not now.

44:08.432 --> 44:09.967
What the fuck's going on?

44:11.035 --> 44:12.269
Hey, hey.

44:13.037 --> 44:14.138
Where's Aldo?

44:14.872 --> 44:15.873
What?

44:30.020 --> 44:32.256
Aldo? He's not here.

44:34.458 --> 44:36.360
Aldo? Aldo?

44:36.393 --> 44:37.227
Aldo?

44:37.261 --> 44:39.196
- What happened to him?
- I don't know.

44:39.229 --> 44:41.165
- Is he gone?
- Yes, he's gone.

44:41.198 --> 44:42.399
Maybe he went through.

44:42.433 --> 44:44.468
Don't you
start that shit!

44:48.005 --> 44:49.440
That's Aldo. That's Aldo.

44:49.473 --> 44:51.508
Tulls... No, Tulls.

44:51.542 --> 44:53.310
Tulls, that is not Aldo, okay?

44:53.344 --> 44:54.578
He didn't go out in the water.

44:54.611 --> 44:56.280
You saw the radar.
Somebody's out there.

44:56.313 --> 44:58.115
If it's not Aldo
it's somebody dying.

44:58.148 --> 45:00.184
And I'm not gonna sit here
and listen to it happen.

45:00.217 --> 45:02.252
- Then let me go.
- Hell, no!

45:02.286 --> 45:03.587
You got us in this mess.

45:05.122 --> 45:06.323
Listen, you stay
with the boat, man.

45:06.357 --> 45:07.891
Wait, what are you doing?

45:07.925 --> 45:09.059
He has to stay with the boat.

45:09.093 --> 45:10.594
I'm said I will go!

45:10.627 --> 45:12.930
What? So you can prove
your fucking theory?

45:12.963 --> 45:14.264
Christ, you probably hope
he's gone.

45:14.298 --> 45:15.933
Hey, shut up!

45:15.966 --> 45:18.235
You know what, Grant? How 'bout you get
your head out of her ass for two seconds

45:18.268 --> 45:19.370
and figure out what
the fuck's going on here, okay?

45:19.403 --> 45:21.138
She doesn't give
a shit about you,

45:21.171 --> 45:23.307
she doesn't give a shit about
me or anybody else in this boat.

45:23.340 --> 45:24.608
That is not true.

45:24.641 --> 45:26.143
You don't know
what you're talking about.

45:27.111 --> 45:28.445
Sure I don't.

45:28.479 --> 45:30.547
You're just as sick as she is.
You guys are made for each other.

45:30.581 --> 45:32.182
Wait. Wait.

45:33.617 --> 45:35.919
Here. Take this.

45:39.390 --> 45:41.125
And don't leave me
out there, man.

46:23.768 --> 46:25.202
Aldo?

46:28.740 --> 46:30.174
Aldo?

46:35.713 --> 46:37.481
Damn it, I got to get
the power on in here.

46:37.514 --> 46:38.649
Aldo!

46:38.683 --> 46:40.417
Move, move, move.
Give me a hand with this.

46:40.451 --> 46:42.486
Come on.

46:42.519 --> 46:44.555
I need more light.

46:44.588 --> 46:45.589
The boathouse.

46:49.026 --> 46:50.294
Aldo?

46:52.196 --> 46:53.564
Aldo?

47:01.371 --> 47:02.774
All right,
when I connect this,

47:02.807 --> 47:04.174
pull that cord over there

47:04.208 --> 47:05.342
and see if you can get
this thing started.

47:05.375 --> 47:08.178
Come on, ready? Go ahead.

47:08.212 --> 47:10.380
Aldo?

47:14.518 --> 47:16.220
Come on, damn it, come on.

47:25.462 --> 47:26.764
Aldo?

47:28.432 --> 47:29.633
Oh, God.

47:38.108 --> 47:39.343
Aldo?

48:15.479 --> 48:17.414
Cassandra?

48:17.447 --> 48:19.216
Cassandra?

48:24.521 --> 48:25.522
Help me out!

48:33.130 --> 48:34.766
Help, help me. Help me!

48:34.799 --> 48:36.600
Help me, help me,
help me. Pull!

49:08.933 --> 49:11.101
Oh, my God, she's gone.

49:12.202 --> 49:13.337
She's not gone.

49:13.972 --> 49:15.305
Rachel, she was right there.

49:15.339 --> 49:16.741
- She's gone.
- She's not gone.

49:16.774 --> 49:18.475
- She's gone.
- What the hell are you talking about?

49:18.508 --> 49:19.777
- She's still here.
- Who?

49:19.811 --> 49:21.411
Cassandra.

49:21.445 --> 49:24.481
And... and Aldo,
and... Benjamin Briggs...

49:24.514 --> 49:26.483
Shut the fuck up
with this shit!

49:26.516 --> 49:28.185
I don't wanna hear
any more of this!

49:28.218 --> 49:30.120
I saw them.

49:31.889 --> 49:34.926
We are in the rift.

49:34.959 --> 49:37.194
I don't believe I'm
listening to this bullshit.

49:37.227 --> 49:38.595
Grant, Grant, please.

49:41.733 --> 49:43.233
We have to try.

49:44.836 --> 49:45.870
Please.

49:46.637 --> 49:48.271
Okay.

49:48.305 --> 49:49.674
Okay.

49:50.108 --> 49:51.709
What do we do?

49:53.644 --> 49:54.846
Come on.

50:01.886 --> 50:03.520
Son of a bitch.

50:56.373 --> 50:57.407
Come closer.

51:20.530 --> 51:22.700
I know you're here inside.

51:28.438 --> 51:29.506
<i>What are you
trying to tell me?</i>

51:40.685 --> 51:42.019
Were you on the <i>Mary Celeste?</i>

51:43.888 --> 51:45.622
This is stupid.

51:45.656 --> 51:46.724
Please.

51:48.325 --> 51:49.559
Stupid.

51:59.469 --> 52:01.471
Did anything here belong to you?

52:22.459 --> 52:23.460
There you are.

52:27.031 --> 52:28.598
Do you have the disposables?

52:29.734 --> 52:30.868
I have one.

52:46.383 --> 52:47.785
We want to listen to you.

53:19.917 --> 53:21.451
Show me something.

53:29.727 --> 53:31.062
Fuck me.

53:33.798 --> 53:35.465
Is that you, Sophia?

53:38.903 --> 53:41.538
Sophia, is anyone else
here with you?

53:45.776 --> 53:47.544
<i>Daddy...</i>

53:47.577 --> 53:48.846
Your mommy and daddy?

53:52.783 --> 53:54.752
Are our friends
with you, Sophia?

53:58.856 --> 54:00.691
Are our friends with you?

54:02.059 --> 54:03.661
We're trying to find them.

54:11.035 --> 54:13.570
Sophia, you don't have
to be afraid.

54:14.839 --> 54:16.841
I know so much about you.

54:19.509 --> 54:20.811
I know that your mommy

54:20.845 --> 54:22.013
taught you a song.

54:26.017 --> 54:29.987
<i>♪ Little drops of water</i>

54:30.821 --> 54:34.457
<i>♪ Little grains of sand</i>

54:35.693 --> 54:38.796
<i>♪ Make the mighty ocean</i>

54:39.730 --> 54:43.067
<i>♪ And the pleasant land</i>

54:44.835 --> 54:48.605
<i>♪ Little deeds of kindness</i>

54:49.639 --> 54:52.677
<i>♪ Little words of love</i>

54:54.712 --> 54:57.580
<i>♪ Make our earth happy</i>

54:57.614 --> 55:00.718
<i>♪ Like heaven above ♪</i>

55:05.189 --> 55:06.623
I saved some film.

55:59.744 --> 56:01.578
Grant? Grant?

56:04.782 --> 56:06.083
Grant?

56:06.884 --> 56:08.753
No, no, no, Grant.

56:08.786 --> 56:10.721
Talk to me, please.
You're okay.

56:11.355 --> 56:12.923
Grant, you're...

56:23.034 --> 56:24.634
Jenny.

56:47.258 --> 56:48.993
<i>Come here, Mommy.</i>

56:58.736 --> 56:59.837
Don't let him go!

57:57.895 --> 57:59.396
What was her name?

58:03.100 --> 58:04.401
Jennifer.

58:09.840 --> 58:11.175
Jenny.

58:21.085 --> 58:23.154
We were in the Sea of Japan.

58:24.722 --> 58:28.125
Fishermen
in the area reported...

58:30.127 --> 58:32.229
problems with
their instruments,

58:33.464 --> 58:35.232
power outages.

58:40.504 --> 58:42.339
I wanted her...

58:43.841 --> 58:45.309
to see what I did.

58:47.845 --> 58:51.182
I wanted her to see
why I was gone so much.

58:52.416 --> 58:53.984
So, I took her with me.

59:01.258 --> 59:03.994
We were playing our game,

59:04.028 --> 59:07.031
she was hiding from me...

59:08.866 --> 59:10.201
and then she was just...

59:17.274 --> 59:18.943
<i>She was gone.</i>

01:00:03.187 --> 01:00:04.855
The <i>Marianna.</i>

01:00:07.324 --> 01:00:09.159
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

01:00:09.193 --> 01:00:11.795
This is the <i>Allegro.</i>
We need assistance immediately.

01:00:12.196 --> 01:00:13.497
God damn it.

01:00:36.053 --> 01:00:37.988
Come on.
You gotta be seeing this.

01:00:42.092 --> 01:00:43.994
Oh, come on. Damn it.

01:00:45.095 --> 01:00:46.130
Come on!

01:00:46.997 --> 01:00:48.032
Damn it.

01:00:54.438 --> 01:00:56.307
- Enough of this.
- No! No!

01:01:09.386 --> 01:01:11.155
We're getting off
of this boat.

01:01:11.188 --> 01:01:13.891
You're taking this damn vest
and you're putting it on, now!

01:01:15.592 --> 01:01:17.061
Did you hear that?

01:01:21.532 --> 01:01:22.599
What?

01:01:26.437 --> 01:01:29.006
Hey. Hey!

01:02:20.991 --> 01:02:23.293
Hello?

01:02:23.327 --> 01:02:25.295
<i>Is that you, Mommy?</i>

01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:27.464
Yes.

01:02:29.032 --> 01:02:30.401
I'm here.

01:02:31.568 --> 01:02:33.937
I'm here. I hear you.

01:02:33.971 --> 01:02:36.039
I hear you.

01:02:40.043 --> 01:02:41.979
Can you hear me, baby girl?

01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:44.248
I'm right here.

01:02:47.351 --> 01:02:48.519
I found you.

01:02:48.552 --> 01:02:50.487
<i>I hear you, Mommy?</i>

01:02:50.521 --> 01:02:52.556
Yeah, I'm right here.

01:02:52.589 --> 01:02:55.058
I'm right here.
Mommy's right here.

01:03:01.565 --> 01:03:03.600
Rachel, they're here.

01:03:03.634 --> 01:03:05.202
Let's go, now!

01:03:12.009 --> 01:03:14.411
It's so warm.

01:03:15.112 --> 01:03:17.114
It's so warm.

01:03:18.081 --> 01:03:19.583
<i>It's a sea lion.</i>

01:03:21.518 --> 01:03:24.656
Yeah, I'm here.
I found you.

01:03:24.689 --> 01:03:27.324
I found you.

01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:30.561
What?

01:03:41.638 --> 01:03:43.775
I can't...
I can't underst...

01:03:45.810 --> 01:03:47.010
What?

01:03:53.584 --> 01:03:55.185
Wha...

01:04:16.841 --> 01:04:18.308
Tulls...

01:04:18.342 --> 01:04:19.376
Tulls, we have to go.

01:04:20.477 --> 01:04:22.145
Tulls, we have to go.

01:04:22.179 --> 01:04:25.182
Tulls? Tulls, we have to go!

01:04:25.215 --> 01:04:28.051
Tulls, we have to
get out of here.

01:04:36.661 --> 01:04:38.128
Tulls?

01:04:48.438 --> 01:04:49.774
Tulls?

01:05:08.425 --> 01:05:09.727
<i>Mommy.</i>

01:05:15.432 --> 01:05:17.334
- <i>Mommy.</i>

01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:22.105
No!

01:05:26.711 --> 01:05:29.212
<i>Mommy, Mommy...</i>

<i>Mommy, Mommy...</i>

01:09:42.733 --> 01:09:44.702
- <i>Grant!</i>
- <i>Help me!</i>

01:09:45.736 --> 01:09:47.470
<i>Grant, give me a hand.</i>

01:09:54.979 --> 01:09:56.981
<i>She's not gone.</i>

01:09:57.014 --> 01:09:58.515
<i>What the hell
are you talking about?</i>

01:09:58.548 --> 01:09:59.750
<i>She's still here.</i>

01:10:01.185 --> 01:10:03.120
<i>Tulls, we have to go.</i>

01:10:03.154 --> 01:10:04.856

<i>Tulls...</i>

01:10:11.863 --> 01:10:14.497
<i>We are in the rift.</i>
