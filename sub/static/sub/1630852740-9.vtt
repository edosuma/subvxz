Having this

00:13.498 --> 00:14.881
perfect booty has brought me

00:14.914 --> 00:15.993
to another

00:16.017 --> 00:17.117
level of success.

- right buttock cheeks

00:26.326 --> 00:27.794
There's no banana peel.

00:27.827 --> 00:29.396
A patient's deformed chin

00:29.429 --> 00:31.274
- is overshadowing
- her personality.

00:31.331 --> 00:32.743
My chin is indented,

00:32.767 --> 00:34.200
it's lumpy and bumpy.

00:34.234 --> 00:35.439
When we go out,

00:35.463 --> 00:36.667
I am hiding it.

00:36.102 --> 00:37.771
people to be looking at me.

00:36.691 --> 00:37.804
I don't want

00:37.804 --> 00:39.733
There is a risk, 25-30%,

00:39.757 --> 00:41.708
that I can make that worse.

00:41.741 --> 00:43.704

misfortunes spell trouble

00:45.745 --> 00:46.913

00:46.946 --> 00:48.748
The BRCA gene took my breast.

00:48.782 --> 00:50.177
I had my full

00:50.201 --> 00:51.618
hysterectomy with uterus

Growing up,

02:17.812 --> 02:19.696
I guess I never really, like,

02:19.720 --> 02:20.440
thought about having a big butt,

02:20.473 --> 02:21.818
but I moved to

02:21.842 --> 02:23.209
Miami when I was 19

02:23.243 --> 02:24.788
and being in Miami

02:24.812 --> 02:26.379
really opened my eyes

02:26.413 --> 02:28.659
- to different body styles
- and the bigger booty girls,

02:28.715 --> 02:30.260
like, had all the attention

02:30.284 --> 02:31.851
and it just made me think,

02:31.885 --> 02:33.364
like, "Dang, I want to,

02:33.388 --> 02:34.888
like, look like that."

02:34.921 --> 02:36.650
So far, I've done hip

02:38.458 --> 02:40.621
filler injections on

02:40.645 --> 02:42.829

02:42.862 --> 02:45.525
chin lip, ankle lipo...

02:45.549 --> 02:48.234
isn't that weird? It is weird.

02:48.268 --> 02:49.730

02:51.271 --> 02:53.227
- kinda, like,

- I'd just throw the whole
- right side away at this point.

- it's just everything that I have

03:06.920 --> 03:08.315

03:08.339 --> 03:09.756
a lot of pressure for me

to have this perfect booty,

gene took my breast,

03:24.700 --> 03:26.214
and my breast reconstruction

03:26.238 --> 03:27.774
needs a reconstruction.

03:27.807 --> 03:29.570
My left breast

03:29.594 --> 03:31.378
has a lot of extra skin

03:31.411 --> 03:33.588
sagging underneath it.

03:33.612 --> 03:35.786
They are quite deformed,

03:35.810 --> 03:37.175
they just don't look

03:37.199 --> 03:38.585
like a set of breasts.

03:38.618 --> 03:40.247
Growing up, my dad was

03:40.271 --> 03:41.921
my absolute best friend,

03:41.955 --> 03:44.657
but unfortunately in 2011,

03:44.691 --> 03:46.954
my dad shared with us

03:46.978 --> 03:49.262
that he had Paget's cancer.

03:49.295 --> 03:50.741
Paget's cancer is

03:50.765 --> 03:52.232
where it actually starts

03:52.265 --> 03:53.594
on the outside

03:53.618 --> 03:54.968
nipple of the breast.

03:55.042 --> 03:56.703
Never would have thought

03:56.736 --> 03:58.348
- that he would
- have had breast cancer.

03:58.405 --> 04:00.106
For sure. Right.

04:00.140 --> 04:01.908
My dad mentioned to me

04:01.941 --> 04:03.737
that I should get

04:03.761 --> 04:05.578
tested for the BRCA gene

04:05.612 --> 04:07.758
and I found out

04:07.782 --> 04:09.949
that I tested positive.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.361
- Basically, it means
- that I am at higher risk

04:12.385 --> 04:13.730
for breast cancer.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.121
I was just, like,

04:15.155 --> 04:17.534
- "Okay, I've got this gene,
- we're gonna deal with it."

04:17.590 --> 04:21.461
September 2014 is when I had

04:21.494 --> 04:23.209
my double mastectomy

04:23.233 --> 04:24.106
and breast reconstruction.

04:24.130 --> 04:25.565
It was a really hard time

04:25.598 --> 04:27.310
- because I was also
- struggling with my dad

04:27.334 --> 04:29.667
- being in and out
- of the hospital with his cancer.

04:29.693 --> 04:32.115

- whole journey and I'm, like,

04:32.172 --> 04:33.517
-it is not a fun journey.

04:33.541 --> 04:34.908
-No.

04:34.941 --> 04:37.821

- literally, saved my life

05:45.346 --> 05:46.746
How did that happen?

05:46.780 --> 05:48.782
I had my testing

05:48.806 --> 05:50.806
done in early 2014,

05:50.830 --> 05:52.322
and that's when I found out

-Boom.

mastectomy in September

06:08.681 --> 06:09.803

06:09.803 --> 06:12.082
- that same year,
- and I had them remove my nipples

06:12.138 --> 06:13.884
- -and everything.
- -Wow.

06:13.940 --> 06:15.686
- At the same
- time I was in surgery,

06:15.742 --> 06:17.037
-they put in my, uh...

06:17.061 --> 06:18.378
-Tissue expanders?

06:18.411 --> 06:20.223
- Yep, my expanders.
- Within three months,

06:20.280 --> 06:22.248
I had my exchange put in.

06:22.282 --> 06:23.744
So, you went

06:23.768 --> 06:25.251
from expanders to gel,

06:25.285 --> 06:27.120
silicone implants, yes?

06:27.153 --> 06:29.933
- And then I went
- and got my nipples tattooed on.

06:30.560 --> 06:32.134
- So when you had
- the exchange of the expander

06:32.158 --> 06:34.871
- for the implants
- and you took off the dressing,

06:34.928 --> 06:36.690
and you looked in the mirror,

06:36.714 --> 06:38.498
how much like this did it look?

06:38.531 --> 06:40.667
Um, not so much like that.

What was going on

the implant get in there

06:50.760 --> 06:51.644
to expand it out?

06:51.678 --> 06:54.424
- A big fear of mine is
- that it's still breast tissue

06:54.481 --> 06:56.750
that they never got.

06:56.783 --> 06:58.816
[sighing]

06:58.840 --> 07:00.663
- The whole point of doing
- a Prophylactic mastectomy

07:00.687 --> 07:02.188
is to remove breast tissue

07:02.222 --> 07:04.102
- so that the risk
- of developing breast cancer

07:04.157 --> 07:05.492
has been minimized.

07:05.525 --> 07:07.504
- Since Shannah
- had a general surgeon

07:07.560 --> 07:09.195
remove the breast tissue

07:09.229 --> 07:11.675
- before the plastic
- surgeon did the reconstruction,

07:11.731 --> 07:13.477
it seems unlikely that

07:13.501 --> 07:15.268
he would leave breast tissue

07:15.301 --> 07:16.836
in the left breast.

07:16.870 --> 07:18.065
If they did that,

07:18.089 --> 07:19.305
it would be unacceptable,

07:19.339 --> 07:21.574
and frankly, quite devastating.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.185
- I just thought,
- this is just reconstruction.

07:23.209 --> 07:25.426
It's not going to be perfect.

07:25.450 --> 07:27.449
- -It's as good as it gets.
- -Yeah, not gonna be perfect.

07:27.473 --> 07:29.471
So, at what point did you say,

07:29.495 --> 07:31.518
"You know what, I can't deal."

07:31.551 --> 07:32.852
My daughter, who is now eight,

07:32.886 --> 07:34.081
she started

07:34.105 --> 07:35.321
looking at my breasts.

07:35.355 --> 07:37.084
And, I thought,

07:37.108 --> 07:38.858
my daughter's got a 50-50 chance

07:38.892 --> 07:40.228
-of having this same gene.

07:40.252 --> 07:41.610
-Right.

07:41.940 --> 07:43.906
- And I don't know, you know,
- until she's 18 years old,

07:43.930 --> 07:46.666
but I don't want her thinking

07:46.700 --> 07:48.172
that this is

07:48.196 --> 07:49.666
the best that's gonna happen.

07:49.690 --> 07:52.516
- Think about how she's gonna feel
- if she sees me this way.

07:52.572 --> 07:54.207
She'll immediately go,

07:54.240 --> 07:56.519
- "That's the future that's
- in front of me? Is that it?"

07:56.543 --> 07:57.521
And you don't

07:57.545 --> 07:58.545
want that to happen,

07:58.578 --> 08:00.460
that would be devastating.

08:00.800 --> 08:02.224
- At least have two matching,
- you know, like,

08:02.248 --> 08:03.961
-they don't even match, like.

08:03.985 --> 08:05.719
-Right.

08:05.752 --> 08:07.530
- I'm 43 with
- a 60-year-old's body right now!

08:07.554 --> 08:09.356
Okay.

08:09.389 --> 08:10.924
When I get out of the shower

08:11.240 --> 08:12.561
and I see myself

08:12.585 --> 08:13.927
and I see the weight gain

08:14.270 --> 08:16.807
- and I see the deformed breasts,
- in my head,

08:16.863 --> 08:18.665
I'm not comfortable in my skin.

08:18.698 --> 08:20.266
I really want to help you,

08:20.300 --> 08:22.312
- so let's go to
- the exam room and check it out.

08:22.369 --> 08:24.848
- -What would your superpower be?
- -I want to fly too.

08:24.904 --> 08:26.294
You want to fly? This is

08:26.318 --> 08:27.707
never getting off the ground.

08:27.731 --> 08:28.908
[laughing]

08:28.942 --> 08:30.054
What drives you

08:30.078 --> 08:31.211
crazy about your chin?

08:31.244 --> 08:32.990
The indentation, so maybe,

08:33.014 --> 08:34.781
if I could just even it out.

08:34.814 --> 08:37.784
It's not an easy fix.

08:42.822 --> 08:45.592
,

08:45.625 --> 08:47.971
Why do you have

08:47.995 --> 08:50.363
that band of laxity,

08:50.397 --> 08:52.866
why is there no projection, why?

08:52.899 --> 08:55.345
- Let's discuss whether
- this is breast tissue or not.

08:55.402 --> 08:57.137
I don't know.

08:57.170 --> 08:59.850
- The fundamental
- problem with your reconstruction

08:59.906 --> 09:01.645
is that your

09:01.669 --> 09:03.430
implants are not filling out

09:03.760 --> 09:05.086
the lower part of the breast.

09:05.110 --> 09:06.097
Just looking at

09:06.121 --> 09:07.130
Shannah's breast,

09:07.470 --> 09:08.962
I can't seem to wrap

09:08.986 --> 09:10.500
my brain around exactly

09:10.830 --> 09:12.662
why she has such

09:12.686 --> 09:14.540
severe breast distortion.

09:14.870 --> 09:16.224
Is it due to

09:16.248 --> 09:17.624
retained breast tissue,

09:17.657 --> 09:19.469
inadequately released muscle,

09:19.493 --> 09:21.327
scar tissue,

09:21.361 --> 09:23.129
or all of the above?

09:23.163 --> 09:25.392
The bird has more augmentation

09:25.416 --> 09:27.667
than your breast do.

09:27.701 --> 09:28.746
Yes. It's a robin,

09:28.770 --> 09:29.836
it's my dad's name.

09:29.869 --> 09:31.705
Aw, it's beautiful.

09:31.738 --> 09:33.517
By the way,

09:33.541 --> 09:35.342
I'm weirdly obsessed with birds

09:35.375 --> 09:36.854
because they have

09:36.878 --> 09:38.378
a superpower. They can fly.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.524
- People wouldn't
- pick that as a superpower.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.248
What would your superpower be?

09:42.282 --> 09:43.873
I told you when we talked

09:43.897 --> 09:45.486
about that, I want to fly too.

09:45.510 --> 09:47.509
- You want to fly? This is
- never getting off the ground.

09:47.533 --> 09:49.332
- Although, if it did,
- that would be confirmation

09:49.356 --> 09:51.324
that pigs, in fact, do fly.

09:51.358 --> 09:53.193
[all laughing]

09:53.226 --> 09:54.788
Okay, anyway,

09:54.812 --> 09:56.396
um, the plan of attack

09:56.429 --> 09:58.275
would be remove the implant,

09:58.299 --> 10:00.166
release the muscle,

10:00.200 --> 10:01.562
release any scar tissue,

10:01.586 --> 10:02.969
put the new implant in

10:03.125 --> 10:04.938
and then see what it looks like,

10:04.971 --> 10:06.283
and see whether we

10:06.307 --> 10:07.640
could take up lax skin

10:07.674 --> 10:10.210
through the existing scar,

10:10.243 --> 10:11.588
and I might need to

10:11.612 --> 10:12.979
manipulate loose skin

10:13.130 --> 10:15.918
near the areola tattoo,

10:15.942 --> 10:18.752
so maybe I'll cut it out

10:18.785 --> 10:20.363
- and we'll re-tattoo you,
- is that okay?

10:20.387 --> 10:22.516
Yeah. I honestly think

10:22.540 --> 10:24.691
that everything significant

10:24.724 --> 10:26.260
happens for a reason

10:26.590 --> 10:27.970
- and I think that
- what you're gonna do

10:27.994 --> 10:30.964
is going to fix what I thought

10:30.997 --> 10:32.176

- grab hands with the kids

14:00.473 --> 14:01.852
as time went by,

14:01.876 --> 14:03.276
it was just deforming.

- <i>the deformity Peau d'Orange,</i>

14:10.635 --> 14:11.651
indentations in it.

14:11.685 --> 14:13.013
So, with Yazmin's chin,

14:13.037 --> 14:14.387
that's what it looks like

14:14.421 --> 14:16.667
- and that's because of trauma
- to the mentalis muscle,

14:16.723 --> 14:19.670
- that's what causes
- the irregularities of her chin.

14:19.726 --> 14:21.672
When I was about 14 years old,

14:21.696 --> 14:23.663
we found a plastic surgeon.

14:23.697 --> 14:26.143
They took out fat from my tummy

14:26.167 --> 14:28.635
and reconstructed my chin.

14:28.668 --> 14:30.676
Did it work at all?

14:30.700 --> 14:31.687
Uh, I did see

14:31.711 --> 14:32.081
a slight difference.

14:32.105 --> 14:34.174
It was just a little bit fuller.

14:34.207 --> 14:35.669
After the time went by,

14:35.693 --> 14:37.177
it just went away.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.112
Yeah, the fat went away.

14:39.145 --> 14:41.426
- Especially in an area
- where there's a lot of movement,

14:41.481 --> 14:42.659
and that muscle

14:42.683 --> 14:43.883
underneath the chin here,

14:43.917 --> 14:45.461
- it's constantly
- moving as you speak.

14:45.485 --> 14:47.431
- Did you have
- any other procedures?

14:47.487 --> 14:49.383
I did. I had one when I was 25,

14:49.407 --> 14:51.324
another fat transfer,

14:51.358 --> 14:52.636
and then again,

14:52.660 --> 14:53.960
as time passed by,

14:53.993 --> 14:56.329
it just went away again.

14:56.363 --> 14:58.164
So, nothing else after that?

14:58.198 --> 14:59.733
No, I have not.

14:59.766 --> 15:02.168

15:02.202 --> 15:03.768
before you had anything done,

15:03.792 --> 15:05.356
or is it better now?

15:05.380 --> 15:07.351
- -I would say it's worse.
- -Yeah.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.902
Yazmin had fat

15:08.926 --> 15:10.443
transferred to try to smooth

15:10.477 --> 15:12.622
- the contour
- irregularities of her chin.

15:12.679 --> 15:14.314
The problem with fat transfer

15:14.347 --> 15:15.893
is some of the fat will take,

15:15.917 --> 15:17.484

- you can actually knock

18:05.885 --> 18:07.164
of her chin fat pad,

18:07.188 --> 18:08.488
this area right here.

18:08.521 --> 18:10.467
- Now, it could be
- caused by fat atrophy,

18:10.523 --> 18:12.325
which is loss of fatty tissue,

18:12.359 --> 18:14.471
- which could have
- been caused by the trauma

18:14.527 --> 18:16.106
she sustained in the chin

18:16.130 --> 18:17.731

18:17.764 --> 18:19.693
Or, from having multiple

18:19.717 --> 18:21.668
surgeries to the chin area,

18:21.701 --> 18:23.880
- because this area
- doesn't like to have surgeries,

18:23.937 --> 18:25.666
and that can cause lumps,

18:25.690 --> 18:27.440
bumps, irregularities

18:27.474 --> 18:28.485
and give us that

18:28.509 --> 18:29.542
sunken appearance.

18:29.576 --> 18:31.372
So, the goal'll be

18:31.396 --> 18:33.213

So, what do we put there? Fat?

Don't really want to do that.

18:48.561 --> 18:50.507
- I think you've
- already had enough fat there.

18:50.563 --> 18:52.609

18:52.633 --> 18:54.701
is using some cadaver skin.

18:54.734 --> 18:56.046
I think what we'd

30:41.574 --> 30:43.410
So, she's really lucky.

30:43.443 --> 30:46.274
Alright, let's talk about the

30:46.298 --> 30:49.150
gluteal crease on your right.

30:49.490 --> 30:51.487
- Whether it was due
- to the needles injected

30:51.840 --> 30:53.837
or due to fluid being

30:53.861 --> 30:55.857
injected above and below it

30:55.121 --> 30:57.991
you have it.

30:55.881 --> 30:58.240
or both, doesn't really matter,

30:58.240 --> 30:59.811
You should not

30:59.835 --> 31:01.428
consider taking any amount

31:01.461 --> 31:03.590
of fat and putting

31:03.614 --> 31:05.765
it on top or mixing it in

31:05.799 --> 31:08.245
- or layering it or anything,
- and I'll tell you why.

31:08.301 --> 31:11.148
- Fat injection in the buttock
- is the most dangerous procedure

31:11.204 --> 31:13.183
- -in all of plastic surgery.
- -Really? BBLs?

31:13.239 --> 31:15.875
Yes, yes. It is the most fatal

31:15.909 --> 31:17.554
- because there is
- a very short distance

31:17.610 --> 31:20.090
- between these little
- blood vessels in the buttock

31:20.146 --> 31:21.965
and the main vein

31:21.989 --> 31:23.807
bringing blood back to the heart

31:23.116 --> 31:25.585
If you get fat into there,

31:23.831 --> 31:25.618
and the lungs.

31:25.618 --> 31:27.280
and it goes up to your lungs,

31:27.304 --> 31:28.988
game over.

31:29.890 --> 31:32.836
- Your lack
- of gluteal crease on your right,

31:32.892 --> 31:35.772
- there is a procedure
- where you can make an incision,

31:35.829 --> 31:38.508
- you put these deep stitches in,
- you get a scar.

31:38.565 --> 31:40.576
- So, every time you're
- bending over doing things,

31:40.600 --> 31:42.335
you're going to see a scar

31:42.369 --> 31:44.415
and you're operating in

31:44.439 --> 31:46.506
a very hostile environment

31:46.539 --> 31:48.452
- -with all that foreign body.
- -Oh.

31:48.508 --> 31:50.137
You have 5 million

31:50.161 --> 31:51.811
followers with that crease.

31:51.845 --> 31:53.213
I think you're good with that.

from her previous surgeries.

- a layer of Alloderm,

33:37.951 --> 33:39.647

33:39.671 --> 33:41.388
at the top of her skin fat pad

- smooth out any depression

33:43.556 --> 33:44.918
that may exist. Finally,

33:44.942 --> 33:46.326
we'll pull the skin down,

That looks like

33:56.988 --> 33:58.738
more of a chin fat growth.

33:58.772 --> 34:00.484
Interesting, when we

34:00.508 --> 34:02.242
see fat injected in an area,

34:02.275 --> 34:04.488
- usually, it just dissolves,
- but here, it grew.

34:04.544 --> 34:06.255
- This is unexpected
- and completely opposite

34:06.279 --> 34:08.439
from what I originally thought.

34:08.463 --> 34:10.244
She actually has fat growth

34:10.268 --> 34:12.419
from the original fat grafting.

34:12.452 --> 34:13.981
Now, this only

34:14.005 --> 34:15.555
happens in rare instances,

34:15.588 --> 34:16.883
which means it

34:16.907 --> 34:18.224
wasn't fat atrophy,

34:18.258 --> 34:19.403
where the fat dies

34:19.427 --> 34:20.593

34:22.480 --> 34:24.330

34:39.790 --> 34:41.525

34:53.159 --> 34:54.661
Why do you say that?

34:54.694 --> 34:56.238
- Well, because we
