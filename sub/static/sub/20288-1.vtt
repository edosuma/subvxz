00:27.795 --> 00:31.699
(lively but suspenseful music)

01:06.567 --> 01:07.735
(phone vibrates)

01:07.735 --> 01:11.071
(woman moans sensually)

01:12.473 --> 01:16.210
(lips kiss and suckle flesh)

01:20.814 --> 01:23.584
(phone vibrates)

01:33.927 --> 01:38.098
(hand smacks flesh)
(woman whines in displeasure)

01:41.435 --> 01:43.637
(phone vibrates)

01:43.637 --> 01:44.905
(moves into frantic
and suspenseful music)

01:44.905 --> 01:48.642
(woman screams and
grunts in fear)

01:53.414 --> 01:55.983
(woman cries)

02:03.291 --> 02:05.226
[Woman] Stop, please.

02:09.497 --> 02:12.833
(woman screams in pain)

02:14.568 --> 02:18.239
(knife slices through skin)

02:20.474 --> 02:24.645
(moves into energetic
heavy metal music)

02:24.645 --> 02:26.780
The Springfield Chief
of Police Greg Barns

02:26.780 --> 02:28.416
announced this
morning that the FBI

02:28.416 --> 02:30.418
is investigating the
murder of Hannan Williams

02:30.418 --> 02:31.852
as a possible thirteenth victim

02:31.852 --> 02:34.255
of the Slasher serial killer.

02:36.924 --> 02:40.694
It appears that the Slasher
uses a Tor Onion Proxy

02:40.694 --> 02:42.630
to hide his IP address.

02:55.876 --> 02:57.745
Williams's body was
discovered in her apartment

02:57.745 --> 03:00.013
Monday night after friends
reported her disappearance

03:00.013 --> 03:01.682
to local authorities.

03:06.454 --> 03:07.688
And at times,

03:07.688 --> 03:09.790
they'll used a third
party VPN software

03:09.790 --> 03:12.260
to create his own IP addresses.

03:12.260 --> 03:14.528
Now these IP addresses
are associated

03:14.528 --> 03:18.131
with physical addresses
within the area

03:18.131 --> 03:20.701
that the murders have occurred.

03:25.806 --> 03:26.640
Go.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.143
(house guests scream)
Get down, down, down,

03:30.143 --> 03:31.379
down, down!

03:31.379 --> 03:32.380
Down, down, down!
What the hell!

03:32.380 --> 03:34.482
What the hell! Oh my good.

03:34.482 --> 03:37.651
Put your hands up!
Hands in the air!

03:38.986 --> 03:39.820
Don't fucking move!

03:39.820 --> 03:41.154
Don't move!

03:41.154 --> 03:42.423
Shut up!
(man grunts)

03:42.423 --> 03:44.358
(man screams)

03:44.358 --> 03:45.593
[Interviewer] Oh my God.

03:45.593 --> 03:47.027
People in danger
of actually being

03:47.027 --> 03:48.996
falsely arrested
for this murder?

03:48.996 --> 03:50.898
The ah, only danger
at this time, well,

03:50.898 --> 03:54.902
you know I better not
comment on that right now.

04:03.544 --> 04:07.715
(wooden door creaks
and flexes loudly)

04:09.383 --> 04:10.918
Saturday evening
Williams told friends

04:10.918 --> 04:12.920
she was meeting a man
named Tyler Adler,

04:12.920 --> 04:15.556
whom she had met through
an online dating website.

04:15.556 --> 04:17.625
Adler is one of several
aliases the Slasher has used

04:17.625 --> 04:19.627
on various dating sites.

04:29.002 --> 04:30.871
I have no comment
on new leads.

04:30.871 --> 04:32.540
But I can promise you this.

04:32.540 --> 04:35.242
We are following up
on every one of them.

04:35.242 --> 04:36.644
We will find him.

04:41.549 --> 04:44.184
Look, until this
Slasher is caught,

04:44.184 --> 04:47.220
we highly recommend
nobody online dates.

04:47.220 --> 04:48.722
Hey,

04:48.722 --> 04:49.923
some people just have a
hard time meeting people.

04:49.923 --> 04:53.361
That's about all I'm
going to say about that.

05:00.768 --> 05:04.405
No. I have no comment
on how he does that.

05:10.511 --> 05:13.013
Oh, we have five
failed searches.

05:13.013 --> 05:14.247
Freeze, freeze, freeze,
(naked woman screams)

05:14.247 --> 05:15.416
freeze, freeze!

05:15.416 --> 05:16.283
Okay, move, move,
move, move, move, move!

05:16.283 --> 05:17.217
[Naked Man] Fuck!

05:17.217 --> 05:18.452
[Officer] Move, move, move!

05:18.452 --> 05:19.387
Get down right now!

05:19.387 --> 05:21.054
[Naked Man] Don't shoot! Fuck!

05:21.054 --> 05:22.456
Fuck! No!

05:22.456 --> 05:24.291
Take that thing off!

05:43.844 --> 05:46.213
The photo in Adler's
profile has been identified

05:46.213 --> 05:47.415
as an Austin, Texas man

05:47.415 --> 05:49.182
and he is not considered
to be a suspect

05:49.182 --> 05:51.519
in Williams's death.

05:51.519 --> 05:53.554
Internet records reveal
Williams and Adler

05:53.554 --> 05:55.022
had not meet prior to Saturday

05:55.022 --> 05:57.825
but they have been communication
online for a few weeks.

05:57.825 --> 05:59.393
The FBI was called
into the investigation

05:59.393 --> 06:02.029
when forensics reported
William's injuries
were consistent

06:02.029 --> 06:04.832
with those of the previous
victims of the Slasher.

06:04.832 --> 06:06.700
The last murder was one
month ago in St. Louis

06:06.700 --> 06:08.802
and authorities believe the
killer is still in Missouri.

06:08.802 --> 06:09.970
(soft knocking)

06:09.970 --> 06:11.338
Women should exercise
extreme caution

06:11.338 --> 06:13.774
when using internet
dating sites.

06:13.774 --> 06:17.277
(calm and relaxing music)

06:24.785 --> 06:26.854
[Man] Kristy right?

06:26.854 --> 06:27.688
Jack.

06:30.458 --> 06:32.793
It's so good to finally
meet you in person.

06:32.793 --> 06:34.828
Yeah. Come on in.

06:34.828 --> 06:36.296
Thanks.

06:36.296 --> 06:37.297
Um, picture?

06:38.599 --> 06:39.433
Sure.

06:41.935 --> 06:43.303
(camera clicks)

06:43.303 --> 06:44.137
Not bad.

06:47.475 --> 06:48.842
I like your belt buckle.

06:48.842 --> 06:51.845
Oh Thanks. I've
had it for years.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.080
You know you weren't kidding

06:53.080 --> 06:54.482
about living the
meager lifestyle.

06:54.482 --> 06:56.383
Um, it's clean I guess.

06:56.383 --> 06:57.618
Yeah.

06:57.618 --> 06:58.986
I just don't know what
to do with the space

06:58.986 --> 07:01.021
so I keep it plain.

07:01.021 --> 07:04.692
Keeps things simple
though. How was your drive?

07:04.692 --> 07:06.193
Oh, it was fine,

07:06.193 --> 07:09.196
I make the drive between here
and St. Louis all the time.

07:09.196 --> 07:10.130
For work?

07:10.130 --> 07:11.699
Family mostly.

07:11.699 --> 07:13.200
You know,

07:13.200 --> 07:14.602
you look different from the
pictures you have online.

07:14.602 --> 07:17.838
Yeah, I guess I
need to update them.

07:17.838 --> 07:19.039
No, it's fine.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.541
I'm pleasantly surprised.

07:20.541 --> 07:23.010
Most of the time with these
things, it's the opposite.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.578
Wow, thanks.

07:24.578 --> 07:27.581
Yeah I've been trying to
take better care of myself.

07:27.581 --> 07:30.884
Plus, I don't take
very good photos.

07:30.884 --> 07:35.022
You look great though,
just like your photos.

07:35.022 --> 07:37.024
Oh really? Which ones?

07:39.493 --> 07:42.796
Well, all of them.

07:42.796 --> 07:45.365
Wow, you are good.

07:46.534 --> 07:47.768
What happened to
the smooth talker

07:47.768 --> 07:48.969
I've been chatting with
these past few weeks?

07:48.969 --> 07:50.904
I guess I'm just
a bit nervous.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.873
This is a crazy idea.

07:52.873 --> 07:56.944
Why? Do you think I'm
the Slasher or something?

08:00.514 --> 08:02.115
Lighten up. I was
just joking with you.

08:02.115 --> 08:03.483
Besides, you're not a girl.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.519
This just turned weird.

08:05.519 --> 08:07.921
Come on. It's an adventure.

08:10.390 --> 08:13.060
Our first real date is a
weekend trip to a cabin.

08:13.060 --> 08:16.564
No menu to hide behind,
nature, fresh air.

08:17.765 --> 08:20.200
It's a great way to
get to know someone.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.802
You can back out if you want.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.336
I mean, I can cancel
our reservation.

08:23.336 --> 08:26.506
But, it would make a pretty
bad first impression.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.441
No, I think it sounds great.

08:28.441 --> 08:30.310
An adventure, right?

08:30.310 --> 08:32.580
Yeah. An adventure.

08:32.580 --> 08:35.315
You know you talk just
like you do when we chat.

08:35.315 --> 08:37.384
You know, you don't.

08:37.384 --> 08:39.318
Sorry. I'm just nervous.

08:39.318 --> 08:40.721
Nervous, right.

08:42.623 --> 08:45.693
You really need some
better pictures.

08:48.395 --> 08:50.030
(camera clicks)

08:50.030 --> 08:54.201
("Steel Toes" by
Don't Mind Dying)

09:05.679 --> 09:09.016
* I saw the World Wars coming

09:09.016 --> 09:12.786
* Lost my wine along the way

09:14.187 --> 09:16.323
* I pitch a tent...

09:16.323 --> 09:19.927
It's weird meeting
face to face isn't it?

09:21.128 --> 09:22.663
Do you always take
guys you just met

09:22.663 --> 09:24.665
out to the middle of nowhere?

09:24.665 --> 09:26.099
No,

09:26.099 --> 09:27.935
usually we just go to a dinner
or a movie or something.

09:27.935 --> 09:29.436
Really?

09:29.436 --> 09:31.672
You don't strike me as the
dinner and a movie type?

09:31.672 --> 09:32.806
Maybe that's why
the guys I date

09:32.806 --> 09:35.308
don't stick around very long.

09:35.308 --> 09:37.377
So where'd you
get this idea from?

09:37.377 --> 09:39.613
I mean I like it and all.

09:39.613 --> 09:40.513
Well my mom
showed me an article

09:40.513 --> 09:42.382
about crazy first dates

09:42.382 --> 09:43.316
and I wanted to try one.

09:43.316 --> 09:45.619
So this is what I came up with.

09:45.619 --> 09:49.222
Aren't you afraid
it could go badly?

09:49.222 --> 09:51.925
We chatted enough for
me to feel good about you.

09:51.925 --> 09:52.860
Besides,

09:52.860 --> 09:54.094
if things didn't check out

09:54.094 --> 09:54.895
by my standards
at your apartment,

09:54.895 --> 09:55.963
I was going to bail.

09:55.963 --> 09:57.264
Like what?

09:57.264 --> 09:58.632
You really want to know?

09:58.632 --> 09:59.466
Kind of.

10:00.333 --> 10:01.769
Okay.

10:01.769 --> 10:03.570
If you looked worse
than your pictures.

10:03.570 --> 10:05.538
That turned out to
be the opposite.

10:05.538 --> 10:06.774
If you really didn't have a car.

10:06.774 --> 10:08.776
It turns out you
have a nice car.

10:08.776 --> 10:10.577
If your apartment was
different than you described.

10:10.577 --> 10:13.513
Turned out to be pretty
much like you said.

10:13.513 --> 10:15.683
Plus, you weren't
forceful at all.

10:15.683 --> 10:17.550
In fact you seem kind of scared.

10:17.550 --> 10:20.187
Wow. You were
evaluating me that much?

10:20.187 --> 10:21.021
Were?

10:22.956 --> 10:24.858
Who said I've stopped?

10:24.858 --> 10:25.693
And, uh,

10:26.760 --> 10:28.495
how am I doing?

10:28.495 --> 10:29.963
Not so bad,

10:29.963 --> 10:31.298
there's still critical
data I'll need to collect

10:31.298 --> 10:34.367
before giving you the
full assessment though.

10:34.367 --> 10:35.936
And what is that?

10:38.338 --> 10:41.775
(Jack and Kristy giggle)

11:12.405 --> 11:14.141
Are you sure
this is the place?

11:14.141 --> 11:16.109
Pretty sure.

11:16.109 --> 11:18.746
Shouldn't there be a
big sign or something?

11:18.746 --> 11:19.980
I don't know?

11:19.980 --> 11:23.250
I'll call just to make
sure this is the place.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.518
I don't have a signal here.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.788
(sighs) Me neither.

11:27.788 --> 11:30.523
I guess that's just part
of the fun though. Right?

11:30.523 --> 11:32.760
So you have been
around here right?

11:32.760 --> 11:33.927
Yeah. I love
this nature stuff.

11:33.927 --> 11:35.695
I thought I told you that?

11:35.695 --> 11:36.629
You did,

11:36.629 --> 11:38.631
I just didn't realize you meant

11:38.631 --> 11:40.000
this.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.634
I try to do as many
outdoor vacations

11:41.634 --> 11:44.371
during the summer as possible.

11:44.371 --> 11:45.939
I come to this area a lot.

11:45.939 --> 11:48.942
Hiking, camping,
floating, cabins.

11:48.942 --> 11:50.944
I never stayed here though.

11:50.944 --> 11:52.880
Well, shall we?

11:52.880 --> 11:54.547
It's an adventure.

11:57.785 --> 11:59.486
Man it's hot.

11:59.486 --> 12:00.720
Good old Missouri summers,

12:00.720 --> 12:01.955
hot and sticky.

12:03.523 --> 12:05.525
I hope the bugs
aren't that bad.

12:05.525 --> 12:08.328
Man, you are a city boy.

12:08.328 --> 12:10.864
Sorry. It's beautiful though.

12:10.864 --> 12:12.332
You're beautiful.

12:12.332 --> 12:15.568
I think that you're beautiful.

12:15.568 --> 12:16.403
Smooth.

12:19.039 --> 12:19.873
Jesus.

12:26.279 --> 12:27.714
(low, ominous music)

12:27.714 --> 12:28.715
There's the sign.

12:28.715 --> 12:30.350
Looks like we made it.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.953
Should we just go in?

12:32.953 --> 12:33.787
Come on.

12:47.935 --> 12:48.768
Hello?

12:54.174 --> 12:55.008
Hello?

12:57.377 --> 12:58.812
Hi. Come on in.

12:58.812 --> 12:59.646
Hi.

13:01.348 --> 13:03.216
Oh you must be Kristy,

13:03.216 --> 13:05.485
and you must be Jack.

13:05.485 --> 13:07.955
What an attractive
couple you two are.

13:07.955 --> 13:09.089
How are you two?

13:09.089 --> 13:11.859
[Kristy] We're fine, thanks.

13:11.859 --> 13:13.560
I was just cooking
something and I just thought.

13:13.560 --> 13:14.394
It smells

13:14.394 --> 13:17.630
(sudden ominous music)

13:19.799 --> 13:21.801
very good. Yeah.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.670
Thank you hun.

13:23.670 --> 13:25.405
That's a nice spoon.

13:25.405 --> 13:29.542
(calm but suspenseful music)

13:29.542 --> 13:31.044
Yes it is.

13:31.044 --> 13:33.914
It's been in my family
for generations.

13:33.914 --> 13:36.716
It's sterling silver. Heavy.

13:36.716 --> 13:37.951
(giggles)

13:37.951 --> 13:41.588
That's probably why
I'm such a good cook.

13:41.588 --> 13:43.790
Is the reservation
in your name?

13:43.790 --> 13:46.493
You'll have to
forgive my appearance.

13:46.493 --> 13:49.496
I have been making
lunch all day and

13:49.496 --> 13:51.264
cleaning down stairs.

13:52.299 --> 13:53.466
You have a basement here?

13:53.466 --> 13:54.902
We don't have basements,

13:54.902 --> 13:56.469
we have a rumpus room

13:56.469 --> 13:58.838
where we like to play games

13:58.838 --> 13:59.907
and have fun.

14:02.109 --> 14:05.145
And everyone around
here calls me Momma.

14:05.145 --> 14:06.479
You can call me Momma.

14:06.479 --> 14:08.381
(calm but suspenseful music)

14:08.381 --> 14:10.550
Thanks, Momma.

14:11.784 --> 14:12.619
So,

14:13.620 --> 14:16.589
I see that we have you in,

14:16.589 --> 14:18.525
we have you in cabin C.

14:19.626 --> 14:21.394
You booked that online I see?

14:21.394 --> 14:22.229
Yup.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.197
Very nice.

14:30.470 --> 14:33.140
Don't let those
machetes dirty my house.

14:33.140 --> 14:34.507
Easy now, woman!

14:34.507 --> 14:37.244
(giggles) Men.

14:43.483 --> 14:45.052
This is my husband,

14:47.320 --> 14:48.155
Jesse.

14:50.523 --> 14:51.992
Nice to meet you two.

14:51.992 --> 14:54.161
Nice to meet you too, sir.

14:54.161 --> 14:57.230
And this is my
daughter Caitlin,

14:57.230 --> 14:58.731
who has blue hair.

15:00.033 --> 15:01.134
Hell of a place around here.

15:01.134 --> 15:02.602
Thank ya.

15:02.602 --> 15:04.004
Me and little Caitlin were
just thrashing down some weeds

15:04.004 --> 15:05.572
around the property.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.140
You gotta keep beating
mother nature back

15:07.140 --> 15:08.441
or she'll take over everything.

15:08.441 --> 15:12.045
(calm but suspenseful music)

15:12.045 --> 15:13.981
Must be hot out there, huh?

15:13.981 --> 15:16.316
It's the perfect
day to get naked.

15:16.316 --> 15:18.351
That's gross Momma.

15:18.351 --> 15:19.452
It's not gross,

15:19.452 --> 15:20.887
it's being human.

15:22.956 --> 15:24.224
What about you city girl?

15:24.224 --> 15:25.692
What do you think?

15:25.692 --> 15:27.194
I'm sorry?

15:27.194 --> 15:29.029
Do you like to get all
naked up in the big city?

15:29.029 --> 15:31.731
Caitlin, I think
you need to be quiet.

15:31.731 --> 15:32.799
It's alright.

15:32.799 --> 15:34.334
I'm from St. Louis.

15:34.334 --> 15:36.103
It's not really a big city
like Chicago or New York.

15:36.103 --> 15:38.205
Yeah, I know
where you are from.

15:38.205 --> 15:40.207
Caitlin! You hush now.

15:42.842 --> 15:44.644
Yes daddy.

15:44.644 --> 15:47.614
Oh these kids these days.

15:47.614 --> 15:50.117
You know, they're so curious.

15:50.117 --> 15:51.051
When we heard that
you were coming

15:51.051 --> 15:53.486
all the way from St. Louis,

15:53.486 --> 15:55.955
Caitlin just kept on
talking about you.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.890
Isn't that right, Caitlin?

15:57.890 --> 15:58.891
Yes Momma.

16:00.593 --> 16:01.728
Yeah, so,

16:02.695 --> 16:04.697
are we good to go?

16:04.697 --> 16:07.834
You need to sign just in
case something happens to you.

16:07.834 --> 16:11.971
A little rental agreement
that assures Myer's Rentals

16:11.971 --> 16:14.474
are not responsible for
anything that happens to you

16:14.474 --> 16:16.143
or doesn't happen to you.

16:16.143 --> 16:17.544
Just right there.

16:19.346 --> 16:22.182
Sorry. We just have crayons.

16:22.182 --> 16:23.750
Oh, it's alright.

16:25.152 --> 16:26.819
There. Yes, there.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.590
You know we have
a DVD collection

16:30.590 --> 16:32.292
because we don't
have any internet,

16:32.292 --> 16:33.626
and it's right over there.

16:33.626 --> 16:34.727
And maybe you'd
like to go see that

16:34.727 --> 16:37.664
if you are not busy tonight.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.499
I'll go have a look.

16:42.535 --> 16:43.370
Jesse,

16:44.537 --> 16:45.838
why don't you take
this fine young man

16:45.838 --> 16:47.474
down to the cabin and
show him where it is.

16:47.474 --> 16:48.475
Yes ma'am.

16:50.377 --> 16:51.378
Come on son.

16:58.351 --> 16:59.786
Are you alright in here?

16:59.786 --> 17:02.855
I'm fine. I'll find us
something in case we get bored.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.192
We're heading in my truck.

17:08.295 --> 17:10.463
You're pretty near
there as it is.

17:10.463 --> 17:12.232
You see that road?

17:12.232 --> 17:13.333
Yeah.

17:13.333 --> 17:14.666
Well sir,

17:14.666 --> 17:16.069
you take it south

17:17.270 --> 17:19.672
till you come to a
fork in the road.

17:19.672 --> 17:22.209
You follow the left fork.

17:22.209 --> 17:23.443
A few hundred yards
down the road,

17:23.443 --> 17:25.944
you're gonna come
to a crossroads.

17:25.944 --> 17:27.414
Now you make a left.

17:27.414 --> 17:28.615
And your cabin,

17:28.615 --> 17:32.419
well it's going to
be right about there.

17:32.419 --> 17:33.686
You can't miss it.

17:33.686 --> 17:36.123
It's the only one around.

17:36.123 --> 17:37.857
You got all that?

17:37.857 --> 17:39.859
Yes sir, I believe I do.

17:39.859 --> 17:40.693
Yes sir.

17:42.795 --> 17:44.431
What's it like to
live in the city?

17:44.431 --> 17:45.965
Well it's busy.

17:45.965 --> 17:47.867
Way more traffic than here.

17:47.867 --> 17:49.102
What movies you recommend?

17:49.102 --> 17:51.037
I really need to
get out of here.

17:51.037 --> 17:53.606
I'm not a little girl
anymore like they treat me.

17:53.606 --> 17:55.208
I'm not sure what to tell you.

17:55.208 --> 17:58.778
[Caitlin] Do you think
I'm old enough to leave?

17:58.778 --> 18:01.514
That's enough right now honey.

18:01.514 --> 18:03.883
You best be getting
back to your boyfriend.

18:03.883 --> 18:06.153
Yeah, I'll see you later.

18:10.690 --> 18:12.325
Nothing good?

18:12.325 --> 18:13.160
Guess we'll have
to find other ways

18:13.160 --> 18:15.061
to entertain ourselves.

18:15.061 --> 18:16.729
Sounds good to me.

18:17.697 --> 18:18.965
Y'all know where you're going?

18:18.965 --> 18:21.534
Yes sir. You've
been very helpful.

18:21.534 --> 18:24.171
You young folks have
you a good time tonight.

18:24.171 --> 18:26.105
We'll be seeing more of you.

18:26.105 --> 18:26.939
Thanks.

18:33.446 --> 18:34.814
Straight up crazy.

18:34.814 --> 18:36.483
Straight up crazy.

18:36.483 --> 18:38.151
He drew a map on
the hood of his car

18:38.151 --> 18:40.653
in the dust with his spit.

18:40.653 --> 18:41.488
Eww.

18:42.689 --> 18:46.259
(omnious electronic music)

19:42.582 --> 19:45.552
Not a bad looking place.

19:45.552 --> 19:46.386
Quiet.

19:47.320 --> 19:48.655
It's peaceful.

19:49.756 --> 19:51.324
I love the country.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.961
You got the keys right?

20:01.167 --> 20:02.735
It's jammed.

20:02.735 --> 20:04.904
Pull the string muscles.

20:06.606 --> 20:09.509
(low, solid thump)

20:17.517 --> 20:18.718
Wow,

20:18.718 --> 20:20.052
this is a lot nicer

20:20.052 --> 20:21.521
than I thought it would be.

20:21.521 --> 20:23.756
What did you expect?
Dirt floors or something?

20:23.756 --> 20:26.359
Well, kind of I guess.

20:26.359 --> 20:27.794
I'm going to go
get the groceries.

20:27.794 --> 20:29.228
I'm ready for a beer.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.063
Now you are talking.

21:03.796 --> 21:05.798
[Kristy] Whatcha doing?

21:05.798 --> 21:07.400
Looking at these pictures.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.536
They're kind of weird.

21:09.536 --> 21:11.304
Why are they weird?

21:12.305 --> 21:13.740
I don't know.

21:13.740 --> 21:16.042
Who do you think
these people are?

21:16.042 --> 21:19.045
I don't know.
Satisfied customers?

21:20.647 --> 21:24.751
("The Wound" by
Don't Mind Dying)

21:24.751 --> 21:27.153
I've been wanting to
do that for awhile.

21:27.153 --> 21:29.255
Our first kiss.

21:29.255 --> 21:30.590
It's nice.

21:30.590 --> 21:32.124
Exciting.

21:32.124 --> 21:34.361
Yeah, it's real exciting.

21:45.905 --> 21:48.274
* To see a man slowly

21:48.274 --> 21:51.911
* Take his own life

21:51.911 --> 21:54.747
* And watch it wash away

21:54.747 --> 21:57.750
* In oceans of fear

21:58.651 --> 22:02.355
* Said I had a name for himself

22:02.355 --> 22:05.925
* As he lies, I cry

22:05.925 --> 22:10.096
* And a world of self
loathing and tears.

22:31.484 --> 22:33.285
[Jack] Did you
know this was here?

22:33.285 --> 22:35.354
[Kristy] I had no idea.

22:35.354 --> 22:36.355
It's nice.

22:38.825 --> 22:40.860
Too bad we don't have any suits.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.361
Who needs suits?

22:43.730 --> 22:47.366
(mysterious and calm rock music)

22:47.366 --> 22:49.101
What are you doing?

22:53.573 --> 22:55.174
Are you serious?

22:55.174 --> 22:56.509
Yeah. Why not?

23:03.315 --> 23:05.652
Okay, wow. I,

23:05.652 --> 23:06.653
That's nice.

23:08.087 --> 23:08.921
I mean

23:09.856 --> 23:10.690
good job.

23:12.258 --> 23:14.293
Good job? Seriously?

23:14.293 --> 23:16.128
Take off your clothes.

23:19.766 --> 23:20.867
Okay. Fine.

23:22.034 --> 23:23.202
Let's do this.

23:31.043 --> 23:32.445
We're doing this.

23:58.137 --> 23:59.138
I gotta say,

24:00.640 --> 24:03.442
as far as first dates go,

24:03.442 --> 24:04.777
this has been pretty great.

24:04.777 --> 24:06.378
It has.

24:06.378 --> 24:08.080
I'm really glad we did this.

24:08.080 --> 24:10.683
Me too. Our crazy first date.

24:15.321 --> 24:18.991
(pants and moans sensually)

24:27.433 --> 24:31.538
(mysterious and calm rock music)

24:46.185 --> 24:48.087
You're so beautiful.

24:48.087 --> 24:49.756
You're shaking.

24:49.756 --> 24:53.760
(lips suck and smack sensually)

25:14.313 --> 25:18.484
(moves into erratic
and suspenseful music)

25:23.823 --> 25:27.994
(moves into soft
and ominous music)

25:33.499 --> 25:37.336
(pants softly and arousingly)

26:07.133 --> 26:09.068
(tea kettle whistles)

26:09.068 --> 26:13.005
(knife thumps wood repeatedly)

26:45.104 --> 26:49.308
(soft and calm
electric guitar music)

26:57.316 --> 27:01.420
(moves into erratic
and suspenseful music)

27:07.960 --> 27:08.795
Hello?

27:10.262 --> 27:11.597
What the hell?

27:12.732 --> 27:13.966
I don't know.

27:16.568 --> 27:18.004
Are you two up?

27:20.306 --> 27:23.743
I can always come back
if this is a bad time.

27:23.743 --> 27:26.979
Just give me a
second. Hold on.

27:26.979 --> 27:28.314
God you are beautiful.

27:28.314 --> 27:30.817
Oh no. Morning breath.

27:30.817 --> 27:31.818
I like it.

27:42.829 --> 27:43.863
Good morning!

27:43.863 --> 27:45.564
I hope I didn't wake you.

27:45.564 --> 27:46.498
No, you're fine.

27:46.498 --> 27:48.667
We were just laying around.

27:48.667 --> 27:49.936
Good.

27:49.936 --> 27:51.738
Because I made you a
breakfast casserole.

27:51.738 --> 27:54.941
It's kind of like a Myer's
version of a B and B.

27:54.941 --> 27:57.609
Wow. That's really nice ma'am.

27:57.609 --> 28:00.346
I told you, you can
just call me Momma.

28:00.346 --> 28:01.113
Right.

28:01.113 --> 28:01.948
Sorry Momma, I...

28:01.948 --> 28:02.782
(sudden ominous music)

28:02.782 --> 28:05.885
(grunts in approval)

28:06.986 --> 28:08.687
It's good right?

28:08.687 --> 28:09.922
Eggs, potatoes,

28:11.057 --> 28:12.624
onions and parsley.

28:14.994 --> 28:15.828
Hi.

28:15.828 --> 28:17.730
Hi. It looks amazing.

28:18.831 --> 28:22.234
Good. All the
ingredients are local.

28:22.234 --> 28:25.437
I grew the onion and
parsley in my own garden.

28:25.437 --> 28:27.473
I hope you like it.

28:27.473 --> 28:28.941
It's really good.

28:28.941 --> 28:33.445
And you left this phone
at my house yesterday.

28:33.445 --> 28:34.480
I didn't even
notice it was gone.

28:34.480 --> 28:35.681
Thank you.

28:35.681 --> 28:38.117
Well just holler
if you need anything.

28:38.117 --> 28:39.118
Thank you.

28:43.756 --> 28:45.657
Oh my God, it's good.

28:45.657 --> 28:46.558
Yeah?

28:46.558 --> 28:47.493
Oh yeah.

28:47.493 --> 28:51.063
(suspenseful electronic music)

28:51.063 --> 28:52.131
[Kristy] This
really your first time

28:52.131 --> 28:53.532
being out in nature?

28:53.532 --> 28:55.067
You got me.

28:55.067 --> 28:57.904
This is probably the most
time I've spent outdoors.

28:57.904 --> 29:00.206
You're so cute.
How do you like it?

29:00.206 --> 29:02.842
I'm getting used to it.

29:02.842 --> 29:05.945
You can't tell me you're
not having fun. Can you?

29:05.945 --> 29:08.214
I'm having the best time.

29:09.348 --> 29:10.549
What's that?

29:10.549 --> 29:11.851
[Kristy] What?

29:11.851 --> 29:13.752
That. Are those cans?

29:15.154 --> 29:16.388
There's a lot of campers
around here, you know?

29:16.388 --> 29:18.057
Maybe they just left
their junk or something.

29:18.057 --> 29:20.026
Should we pick them up?

29:20.026 --> 29:22.061
You really don't get
these people do you?

29:22.061 --> 29:23.830
What do you mean?

29:23.830 --> 29:25.331
People are different out here.

29:25.331 --> 29:26.665
Some just leave
their junk behind.

29:26.665 --> 29:28.067
That seems wrong.

29:28.067 --> 29:31.570
Rednecks do redneck
things. Don't judge.

29:32.704 --> 29:34.907
Looks like we walked
to the main road.

29:34.907 --> 29:36.675
This is the road we can in on?

29:36.675 --> 29:38.177
[Kristy] Yeah.

29:38.177 --> 29:39.778
[Jack] Not much of a road.

29:39.778 --> 29:40.612
Come on.

29:42.748 --> 29:46.518
(low, ominous music)

29:46.518 --> 29:48.287
[Jack] So, what do we do now?

29:48.287 --> 29:49.856
[Kristy] Hiking isn't
good enough for you?

29:49.856 --> 29:53.459
[Jack] It's good.
It's quiet and peaceful.

29:53.459 --> 29:57.229
This place seems to
be miles from anything.

29:59.866 --> 30:00.900
What's that noise?

30:00.900 --> 30:02.334
Let's go check it out.

30:02.334 --> 30:05.004
(soft smacking)

30:18.250 --> 30:19.418
Hey you two.

30:22.154 --> 30:23.222
It's Caitlin right?

30:23.222 --> 30:24.690
Yeah.

30:24.690 --> 30:27.359
(grunts loudly)

30:28.794 --> 30:30.362
How are you?

30:30.362 --> 30:34.533
Oh, I'm just playing
while daddy does some work.

30:36.302 --> 30:38.504
How are you folks
today? Doing alright?

30:38.504 --> 30:40.439
We are, thanks.

30:40.439 --> 30:43.409
Your wife made us
the best breakfast
casserole this morning.

30:43.409 --> 30:46.578
Yeah boy, that is one
of her finest meals.

30:46.578 --> 30:49.048
You like her
fried catfish too.

30:49.048 --> 30:51.317
You're going after that
stuff pretty hard, huh?

30:51.317 --> 30:52.784
Got to, darlin'.

30:52.784 --> 30:54.453
You got to keep beating
mother nature back

30:54.453 --> 30:56.655
or else that bitch will
take over everything.

30:56.655 --> 30:57.623
(low, ominous music)

30:57.623 --> 31:00.359
Gotta beat mother nature back.

31:00.359 --> 31:03.095
So are we missing any
sights on the property?

31:03.095 --> 31:04.263
Well we got us a lake.

31:04.263 --> 31:06.398
About a mile down that-a-way.

31:06.398 --> 31:07.633
You all been there yet?

31:07.633 --> 31:09.568
[Jack] We had a great
swim there yesterday.

31:09.568 --> 31:11.503
Maybe we'll go back today.

31:11.503 --> 31:13.239
We're also looking
for a grocery store,

31:13.239 --> 31:15.908
some place we can
restock on a few things.

31:15.908 --> 31:17.143
There's a general store

31:17.143 --> 31:20.046
about five mile up the
road past the house.

31:20.046 --> 31:22.348
Six more miles,
you come to town.

31:22.348 --> 31:24.383
They got some real
good Bar-B-Que

31:24.383 --> 31:27.419
down at Petey's Smokehouse.

31:27.419 --> 31:29.956
Might go check
the general store.

31:29.956 --> 31:31.890
Jack, what you thinking?

31:31.890 --> 31:32.724
What?

31:34.326 --> 31:35.161
Sorry.

31:36.628 --> 31:38.664
You wanna check out the
general story or the town?

31:38.664 --> 31:39.932
Yeah, the store.

31:39.932 --> 31:43.269
We can get more
beer for tonight.

31:43.269 --> 31:44.336
Great, thanks.

31:44.336 --> 31:45.771
We'll let you get back to work.

31:45.771 --> 31:47.673
Bye you two.

31:47.673 --> 31:49.508
Yeah, see you later.

31:55.581 --> 31:57.283
Did that seem weird to you?

31:57.283 --> 31:58.384
What? No.

31:58.384 --> 32:00.119
They're nice people.

32:00.119 --> 32:01.988
I think Caitlin
was flirting with me.

32:01.988 --> 32:02.821
I think.

32:02.821 --> 32:03.655
(Kristy laughs)

32:03.655 --> 32:05.657
What? Why is that funny?

32:05.657 --> 32:06.758
Well that's the first
difference I've found

32:06.758 --> 32:08.027
with your profile.

32:08.027 --> 32:09.528
You were so humble online.

32:09.528 --> 32:10.896
Get you out in the woods and
you think everyone wants you?

32:10.896 --> 32:13.232
No, it's not like that, I,

32:14.200 --> 32:15.134
never mind.

32:19.972 --> 32:21.040
(suspenseful guitar music)

32:21.040 --> 32:21.974
I know you fancy him.

32:21.974 --> 32:24.143
I saw what you was doing.

32:24.143 --> 32:25.411
I'm sorry daddy.

32:25.411 --> 32:27.713
Little girls
shouldn't act that way.

32:27.713 --> 32:28.714
Yes daddy.

32:29.648 --> 32:31.283
Who are you Caitlin?

32:31.283 --> 32:32.851
Daddy's little girl.

32:32.851 --> 32:34.553
That is right sweetheart.

32:34.553 --> 32:36.488
You're daddy's little girl.

32:36.488 --> 32:38.890
And only daddy's little girl.

32:40.059 --> 32:41.527
You stay away from
them two. Hear?

32:41.527 --> 32:42.528
Yes daddy.

32:43.829 --> 32:45.031
That's my girl.

32:45.031 --> 32:46.832
(loud smooching)

32:46.832 --> 32:47.833
Now you go play with
your doll babies,

32:47.833 --> 32:50.436
I still got me some work to do.

32:50.436 --> 32:52.838
(loud smack)

33:20.299 --> 33:22.068
This place is old fashioned.

33:22.068 --> 33:24.336
It's rustic and cute.

33:24.336 --> 33:25.937
If you say so.

33:25.937 --> 33:27.206
I'm sure that they
have the beer you want.

33:27.206 --> 33:30.276
At the very least,
the beer you need.

33:31.710 --> 33:33.145
Hey guys, what's up?

33:33.145 --> 33:34.713
How's it going?

33:34.713 --> 33:36.515
Looks like you've been
doing some serious hiking.

33:36.515 --> 33:38.950
Yeah, I'm on a two week
hike through the Ozarks.

33:38.950 --> 33:40.419
Two weeks?

33:40.419 --> 33:43.455
Yeah man, I love this
stuff man. Nature, wildlife.

33:43.455 --> 33:45.524
Wildlife? Don't
you ever get nervous?

33:45.524 --> 33:46.725
Aww, no man.

33:46.725 --> 33:47.993
The animals they're
all pretty calm.

33:47.993 --> 33:49.761
Keep to themselves
for the most part.

33:49.761 --> 33:51.397
It's the people you
got to worry about.

33:51.397 --> 33:53.932
More than wolves and bears?

33:53.932 --> 33:55.167
I'm just saying, you know?

33:55.167 --> 33:56.735
I hike through private
property every so often.

33:56.735 --> 33:59.571
There're some crazies out
there, I'll tell you what.

33:59.571 --> 34:00.739
Hell one time I even got shot at

34:00.739 --> 34:02.741
hiking down through Arkansas.

34:02.741 --> 34:05.744
I told the local sheriff
afterword and he says.

34:05.744 --> 34:09.514
"A man's got a right
to defend what's his."

34:09.514 --> 34:11.417
Haven't had any
problems up here though.

34:11.417 --> 34:13.752
As long as I leave the
place like I found it.

34:13.752 --> 34:15.187
All the other hikers
I've talked to though

34:15.187 --> 34:17.223
say pretty much the same thing.

34:17.223 --> 34:18.456
It's the people you
better watch out for

34:18.456 --> 34:20.626
more so than the
than the animals.

34:20.626 --> 34:21.860
Sounds like an adventure?

34:21.860 --> 34:23.728
[Hiker] Yeah. It's
the only way to live.

34:23.728 --> 34:25.030
Maybe we'll see you later.

34:25.030 --> 34:26.532
Yeah.

34:26.532 --> 34:28.667
You guys take care and watch
out for those mosquitoes.

34:28.667 --> 34:29.835
You too man.

34:36.242 --> 34:37.708
Afternoon.

34:37.708 --> 34:39.578
Good afternoon.

34:39.578 --> 34:41.179
Looks like they have
a bit of everything.

34:41.179 --> 34:44.283
Yes they do. I'm
gonna go grab some beer.

34:44.283 --> 34:47.819
So, you from out of town?

34:47.819 --> 34:49.987
Yeah. I'm from St. Louis.

34:49.987 --> 34:52.224
Oh, what brings
you to these parts?

34:52.224 --> 34:54.226
We're staying at a cabin
around here for the weekend.

34:54.226 --> 34:55.627
Oh neat.

34:57.429 --> 34:58.430
Which place?

34:59.731 --> 35:00.766
The Myer's.

35:02.568 --> 35:03.869
Momma's place.

35:03.869 --> 35:06.037
[Kristy] That's the one.

35:09.741 --> 35:11.410
Afternoon Jimmy.

35:11.410 --> 35:12.878
Howdy folks.

35:12.878 --> 35:14.546
Afternoon Sheriff.

35:15.681 --> 35:17.416
This couple's staying
at Momma's place.

35:17.416 --> 35:18.984
The Myer's place eh?

35:18.984 --> 35:20.486
Yup. That's the one.

35:20.486 --> 35:21.320
First night?

35:21.320 --> 35:22.654
[Jack] Second.

35:23.689 --> 35:25.791
Ah, where are my manners?

35:25.791 --> 35:28.194
Tom Westin, the
Sheriff of these parts.

35:28.194 --> 35:30.362
Hi Sheriff, I'm Kristy Smith.

35:30.362 --> 35:32.198
[Jack] Jack Roper.

35:32.198 --> 35:33.365
Pleasure.

35:33.365 --> 35:35.000
They're from St. Louis.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.435
St. Louis?

35:36.435 --> 35:38.036
Welp that's a great city.

35:38.036 --> 35:39.505
Love the pork steaks there.

35:39.505 --> 35:42.408
Lots of fatty goodness.

35:42.408 --> 35:43.542
Do you want anything else?

35:43.542 --> 35:44.743
I'm fine, thanks.

35:44.743 --> 35:46.245
[Jack] What do I owe you?

35:46.245 --> 35:48.013
That brand's $7.34.

35:50.749 --> 35:52.584
(cash register whirls and ticks)

35:52.584 --> 35:53.585
Six beers.

35:54.720 --> 35:55.654
I guess you guys
didn't come here

35:55.654 --> 35:58.156
to party too hard, now did you?

35:59.958 --> 36:02.127
Nope. Just the right amount.

36:02.127 --> 36:04.496
Course with a pretty
thing like yourself,

36:04.496 --> 36:05.697
a man wouldn't need
much to drink then,

36:05.697 --> 36:06.965
would he?

36:06.965 --> 36:08.099
(tinny and suspenseful music)
Yeah, well,

36:08.099 --> 36:09.335
it was great
meeting you Sheriff.

36:09.335 --> 36:10.702
But a guy like you
in a town like this

36:10.702 --> 36:11.937
probably has a lot to do

36:11.937 --> 36:14.373
so we should get
out of your hair.

36:19.611 --> 36:21.247
And y'all don't
hesitate to give me a call

36:21.247 --> 36:23.549
if you need something.

36:23.549 --> 36:24.650
Sure thing.

36:29.855 --> 36:31.189
[Tom] Don't you kids go
having too much fun out there.

36:31.189 --> 36:33.259
Yeah, we'll try not to.

36:40.131 --> 36:41.567
Well Jimmy,

36:41.567 --> 36:42.834
what's the weather report
looking like today?

36:42.834 --> 36:44.703
It's going to be
a hot one sheriff.

36:44.703 --> 36:46.137
Lot of humidity.

36:46.137 --> 36:48.340
Just like this hell hole
city we live in. Hot and slimy.

36:48.340 --> 36:49.575
Say Sheriff,

36:49.575 --> 36:51.209
did you see that thing
on television last night

36:51.209 --> 36:52.544
about the Amish?

36:55.881 --> 36:56.948
You all don't
hesitate to call me

36:56.948 --> 36:59.618
if you need anything now.

36:59.618 --> 37:02.153
(Jack giggles)

37:03.789 --> 37:05.591
I've had a really
great time with you.

37:05.591 --> 37:07.826
This was a great idea.

37:07.826 --> 37:09.328
I'm kind of sad it has to end.

37:09.328 --> 37:10.161
Me too.

37:11.330 --> 37:13.932
Maybe we can come back
for our second date?

37:13.932 --> 37:15.501
Yeah, you want a
second date with me?

37:15.501 --> 37:17.336
I do, if you want one.

37:17.336 --> 37:19.170
If I want one?

37:19.170 --> 37:20.272
I think I do.

37:23.775 --> 37:26.111
[Momma] Hello. It's Momma.

37:28.246 --> 37:29.815
I'm coming Momma.

37:37.456 --> 37:38.724
Hi guys.

37:38.724 --> 37:40.992
I just brought you
a little nightcap.

37:40.992 --> 37:41.960
Wow. Thanks Momma.

37:41.960 --> 37:44.129
That's really kind of you.

37:45.297 --> 37:48.199
Oh, yours looks
a little wilted.

37:48.199 --> 37:49.468
I can fix that.

37:58.143 --> 37:59.778
Yes, it's perfect.

37:59.778 --> 38:02.914
Thanks. By the way,
your casserole was great.

38:02.914 --> 38:05.384
I'm so glad you liked it.

38:05.384 --> 38:07.453
It was delicious.

38:07.453 --> 38:08.454
Well good.

38:11.923 --> 38:13.124
So what is this?

38:13.124 --> 38:15.226
Oh, it's nothing special.

38:15.226 --> 38:18.964
It's just our little
version of a Mint Julep.

38:22.067 --> 38:22.901
Wow.

38:23.735 --> 38:25.737
Mmm. It's really good.

38:26.872 --> 38:30.342
I'll let you folks
get back to your night.

38:30.342 --> 38:31.677
Have a good one.

38:31.677 --> 38:34.413
- Good night.
- Good night Momma.

38:35.814 --> 38:37.215
(heart beats loudly)

38:37.215 --> 38:38.950
(loud thump)

38:38.950 --> 38:41.787
(sharp, high pitched tone)

38:41.787 --> 38:43.522
(loud thump)

38:43.522 --> 38:46.024
(sharp, high pitched tone)

38:46.024 --> 38:48.460
(loud thump)

38:48.460 --> 38:51.797
(sharp, high pitched tone)

38:51.797 --> 38:53.131
(loud thump)

38:53.131 --> 38:56.402
(woman screams loudly)

39:04.676 --> 39:08.847
(low, oscillating
synthesized tone)

39:09.881 --> 39:12.984
(loud thump)

39:12.984 --> 39:14.786
(loud thump)

39:14.786 --> 39:17.022
(man screams disturbingly)

39:17.022 --> 39:19.357
(loud thump)

39:19.357 --> 39:23.462
(woman speaks in distorted tone)

39:28.967 --> 39:31.403
(loud thump)

39:32.438 --> 39:34.873
(loud thump)

39:37.776 --> 39:40.345
(woman speaks in distorted tone)

39:40.345 --> 39:43.949
(man screams disturbingly)

39:47.819 --> 39:49.254
(woman speaks in distorted tone)

39:49.254 --> 39:50.822
Please let me go.

39:52.491 --> 39:53.892
Please let me go.

39:55.561 --> 39:56.962
Please let me go.

40:01.633 --> 40:04.703
(Kristy sobs softly)

40:08.940 --> 40:10.509
(disturbing and
synthesized music)

40:10.509 --> 40:12.043
Please just let me go.

40:12.043 --> 40:12.878
Please.

40:15.413 --> 40:18.349
Why are you doing this to me?

40:18.349 --> 40:19.751
Please let me go.

40:21.620 --> 40:22.954
Please.

40:22.954 --> 40:24.723
No, please let me go.

40:27.459 --> 40:30.161
No! Please just
get away from me.

40:30.161 --> 40:31.697
Get away.

40:31.697 --> 40:33.599
Get away from me!

40:33.599 --> 40:36.267
No. (Cries) no.

40:44.976 --> 40:47.078
Please let me go. Please.

40:50.982 --> 40:52.984
Please just let me go.

40:52.984 --> 40:56.187
Please. Please.

40:56.187 --> 40:58.423
Please let me go, please?

40:58.423 --> 41:01.860
(cries) Please let me go.

41:03.361 --> 41:04.195
Please?

41:05.731 --> 41:07.633
Why are you doing this?

41:08.767 --> 41:09.601
Please.

41:11.002 --> 41:13.171
Please let me go.
Quiet.

41:14.305 --> 41:17.142
Please. I know
you're good people.

41:18.443 --> 41:22.614
(hand smacks skin)
(Kristy screams)

41:24.049 --> 41:25.316
Please.

41:25.316 --> 41:28.019
When I tell you
to talk, you talk.

41:28.019 --> 41:31.723
When I tell you not to
talk, you don't talk.

41:31.723 --> 41:33.559
Shut this girl up Jesse.

41:33.559 --> 41:35.727
Shut her up good.

41:35.727 --> 41:37.428
- Please.
- Yes Momma.

41:37.428 --> 41:38.496
Please just let me go.

41:38.496 --> 41:39.531
Please.

41:39.531 --> 41:41.600
No! (Cries uncontrollably)

41:41.600 --> 41:42.534
No, please!

41:49.307 --> 41:50.842
What are you doing?

41:50.842 --> 41:53.211
Well look who's up?

41:53.211 --> 41:55.280
It's our little city boy.

41:56.682 --> 41:58.283
(Kristy screams and cries)

41:58.283 --> 41:59.284
Stop that.

42:03.622 --> 42:04.923
She can't breath.

42:04.923 --> 42:07.258
She can breath. Can't you?

42:10.061 --> 42:13.565
(Jack grunts in struggle)

42:18.904 --> 42:21.472
[Jack] What's going on?

42:21.472 --> 42:22.307
Oh,

42:23.942 --> 42:26.011
would you like a gag too?

42:28.146 --> 42:29.881
I can give you a gag.

42:44.262 --> 42:45.230
Jesse,

42:45.230 --> 42:47.398
feed this to our city boy.

42:49.935 --> 42:50.936
I won't talk. I swear.

42:50.936 --> 42:51.770
Please no.

42:51.770 --> 42:52.604
No. Don't.

42:52.604 --> 42:53.438
No. No.

42:53.438 --> 42:54.305
Oh no.

42:54.305 --> 42:56.007
No! (Mumbles)

42:56.007 --> 42:58.777
(Kristy screams)

43:02.781 --> 43:05.383
Anything else Momma?

43:05.383 --> 43:06.217
Maybe.

43:08.186 --> 43:12.357
Do we have any more use for
that plaything over there?

43:18.196 --> 43:19.898
(hand smacks skin)

43:19.898 --> 43:23.568
Yup, I think we've
pretty much worn him out.

43:24.870 --> 43:28.106
I think he's all
broken down down here.

43:30.876 --> 43:31.710
Ooh,

43:32.944 --> 43:35.280
this doesn't work.

43:35.280 --> 43:37.448
I think he needs to sleep.

43:39.017 --> 43:41.953
Yes Momma. I'll
put him to sleep.

43:44.122 --> 43:45.290
Go to sleep,

43:47.192 --> 43:48.359
my little boy.

43:50.762 --> 43:54.565
Oh go to sleep,

43:54.565 --> 43:57.335
my little boy.

43:58.837 --> 43:59.838
Go to sleep.

44:08.313 --> 44:12.217
(fluid drips noisily from man)

44:21.860 --> 44:23.428
Jesse, get his gag.

44:25.330 --> 44:26.798
(Mumbles) No.

44:26.798 --> 44:28.033
(groans)

44:28.033 --> 44:28.867
Feed the little boy.

44:28.867 --> 44:29.801
Feed the little boy.

44:29.801 --> 44:31.469
Feed the little boy.

44:32.370 --> 44:34.139
Ooh, feed the little boy.

44:34.139 --> 44:35.606
Feed the little boy.

44:35.606 --> 44:37.275
Feed the little boy.

44:39.911 --> 44:41.579
I love you, Jesse.

44:41.579 --> 44:43.348
I love you too, baby.

44:43.348 --> 44:44.883
Go get the room ready.

44:44.883 --> 44:45.884
Yes Momma.

44:55.761 --> 44:57.095
A strong body.

45:03.201 --> 45:04.870
You ever been with
another man before?

45:04.870 --> 45:07.839
(Jack mumbles and grunts)

45:07.839 --> 45:10.742
(Momma laughs deviously)

45:10.742 --> 45:12.744
My precious little girl.

45:15.646 --> 45:18.383
My pretty, precious,
little girl.

45:26.724 --> 45:30.361
Have you ever been
touched like this before

45:30.361 --> 45:31.797
by another woman?

45:32.831 --> 45:34.099
Do you like it?

45:36.534 --> 45:39.737
(Kristy screams and cries)

45:39.737 --> 45:40.772
Oh come on.

45:40.772 --> 45:42.740
We're just playing games.

45:42.740 --> 45:44.075
That's all we do
here at the cabin.

45:44.075 --> 45:46.177
We just play games.

45:46.177 --> 45:48.013
I'm not gonna kill you.

45:48.013 --> 45:50.515
Jesse, please come on in here.

45:55.086 --> 45:57.222
Aw, come on now,

45:57.222 --> 45:59.991
we's just playing
with all ya'll.

46:00.926 --> 46:02.828
I'm gonna let you go.

46:02.828 --> 46:06.097
You can have a nice
vacation after all.

46:36.494 --> 46:38.163
Well look at that.

46:39.664 --> 46:42.000
She wants to stay after all.

46:43.801 --> 46:46.271
It looks like she does, Momma.

46:46.271 --> 46:50.308
(Laughs deviously) Well then,

46:50.308 --> 46:52.377
take her into the other room

46:52.377 --> 46:55.580
so we can get
started on our fun.

46:55.580 --> 46:56.581
Yes Ma'am.

47:07.725 --> 47:10.561
Finally, we get
some alone time.

47:16.467 --> 47:20.571
I have wanted you since
the time I first saw you.

47:23.174 --> 47:24.442
It wasn't fair

47:24.442 --> 47:27.312
that she got to have
you for her lonesome

47:27.312 --> 47:29.247
with none of us around.

47:30.315 --> 47:31.549
It wasn't fair.

47:32.450 --> 47:33.684
It wasn't fair.

47:35.453 --> 47:39.557
Share and share

47:41.326 --> 47:42.160
alike.

47:53.404 --> 47:57.308
(Kristy struggles and screams)

47:58.910 --> 48:00.946
I should go take care of Kristy.

48:00.946 --> 48:03.148
See what she wants.

48:03.148 --> 48:04.415
Don't you worry,

48:04.415 --> 48:06.151
I'll be back for you.

48:28.239 --> 48:32.410
(Jack grunts in struggle)
(Kristy screams and grunts)

48:50.561 --> 48:53.999
(low, suspenseful music)

49:34.505 --> 49:36.407
Momma, he got loose.

49:36.407 --> 49:40.578
(moves into erratic and
suspenseful electronic music)

50:01.532 --> 50:02.800
My fault?

50:02.800 --> 50:06.071
You the one supposed
to be watching him.

50:06.071 --> 50:09.774
I have seen you tie
a knot to hold a truck.

50:09.774 --> 50:11.609
What the hell happened?

50:11.609 --> 50:12.710
Damned if I know?

50:12.710 --> 50:13.611
Forget about him!

50:13.611 --> 50:15.280
He can't go nowhere!

50:17.182 --> 50:18.449
You are a stupid
son of a bitch.

50:18.449 --> 50:20.051
You stupid, stupid.

50:20.918 --> 50:22.087
Don't call me stupid, woman.

50:22.087 --> 50:23.688
I could break you. Ya hear.

50:23.688 --> 50:25.823
Break your little neck.

50:25.823 --> 50:28.859
Honey, calm down.

50:28.859 --> 50:30.628
You don't tell
me to calm down.

50:30.628 --> 50:32.797
You don't treat
me like no child.

50:32.797 --> 50:34.165
You are no child to me.

50:34.165 --> 50:36.267
You are my protector.

50:36.267 --> 50:38.403
You will always protect me.

50:38.403 --> 50:40.171
You are my life.

50:40.171 --> 50:41.839
You will protect me.

50:42.673 --> 50:44.075
Woman, I swear.

50:45.743 --> 50:47.578
You will protect me.

50:48.879 --> 50:50.215
You are my life.

50:51.616 --> 50:52.450
Momma.

50:54.985 --> 50:56.887
What do I always say?

51:00.491 --> 51:04.295
Your world would end
if I should ever leave.

51:07.432 --> 51:09.134
That's right.

51:09.134 --> 51:10.535
You know it's the truth.

51:10.535 --> 51:11.636
That's right.

51:13.271 --> 51:17.442
It's just sometimes
you get so damn mean.

51:17.442 --> 51:20.278
I know baby, I'm so sorry.

51:20.278 --> 51:21.746
I don't mean to get mean,

51:21.746 --> 51:23.914
but I just getting scared.

51:24.949 --> 51:26.050
I get scared.

51:28.586 --> 51:31.156
But you're my protector.

51:31.156 --> 51:34.091
You'll always take
good care of me.

51:36.127 --> 51:40.465
I've always protected
you. I always will.

51:40.465 --> 51:44.469
(erratic and suspenseful music)

52:00.285 --> 52:02.320
Wake and bake, man.

52:02.320 --> 52:04.822
Help! You've got to help me.

52:06.991 --> 52:09.327
Dude! You're in
your underwear man.

52:09.327 --> 52:11.028
You got to help me.

52:11.028 --> 52:13.498
Those people are bat shit!

52:13.498 --> 52:16.401
They still have my friend.

52:16.401 --> 52:18.969
They're crazy! They drugged me!

52:21.038 --> 52:22.940
Look man, just calm
down man. Have a smoke.

52:22.940 --> 52:24.275
I'm serious. We got go.

52:24.275 --> 52:26.411
Where is your car?

52:26.411 --> 52:29.079
What car, man. I
hike these woods.

52:29.079 --> 52:29.914
We gotta go.

52:29.914 --> 52:30.748
You're not safe either.

52:30.748 --> 52:31.782
They're coming.

52:31.782 --> 52:32.817
It's cool brother.

52:32.817 --> 52:33.684
I know these woods, man.

52:33.684 --> 52:35.353
We're all right.

52:35.353 --> 52:36.187
I'm out of here.

52:36.187 --> 52:38.022
Those people are crazy.

52:38.022 --> 52:38.989
Well look, alright man,

52:38.989 --> 52:39.924
I just can't let you go

52:39.924 --> 52:41.192
traipsing around like that.

52:41.192 --> 52:42.993
I'll take you back to
your cabin, alright?

52:42.993 --> 52:44.829
Just let me get my shoes.

52:44.829 --> 52:45.663
Hurry.

52:50.000 --> 52:53.438
(low, suspenseful music)

52:55.740 --> 52:57.742
You're on my property.

52:59.109 --> 52:59.944
No.

53:02.247 --> 53:03.448
No man. It's cool.

53:03.448 --> 53:06.083
I said, you're
on my property boy.

53:08.185 --> 53:12.357
(bones crack)
(hiker screams in pain)

53:23.268 --> 53:25.603
I can't stand you hippy types.

53:25.603 --> 53:28.239
(hiker moans and grunts in pain)

53:28.239 --> 53:29.640
You sons of bitches
think you own

53:29.640 --> 53:32.076
the whole God damn world!

53:32.076 --> 53:34.078
This is my property!

53:34.078 --> 53:35.913
You hear? My Property!

54:50.120 --> 54:53.358
(suspenseful and thrilling
electronic music)

54:53.358 --> 54:55.860
(loud thumps)

55:15.646 --> 55:18.816
(Jack grunts in pain)

55:20.317 --> 55:21.686
(knife shanks flesh)
(Jack screams in pain)

55:21.686 --> 55:22.953
Well now city boy

55:22.953 --> 55:25.022
that oughta keep your
ass from running off.

55:25.022 --> 55:26.223
You've seen what I did to that

55:26.223 --> 55:27.792
hippie piece of shit.

55:27.792 --> 55:29.527
I'm gonna do the
same thing to you.

55:29.527 --> 55:31.929
But it's your lucky day, son!

55:31.929 --> 55:33.998
You're gonna get to play
with Momma and me first!

55:33.998 --> 55:36.333
(knife slices flesh)
(Jack grunts in pain)

55:36.333 --> 55:39.136
Please just let me go!

55:39.136 --> 55:41.038
I don't get it, city boy.

55:41.038 --> 55:42.407
We watched and that
pretty young thing

55:42.407 --> 55:44.609
bumping uglies
all day yesterday.

55:44.609 --> 55:46.343
What we got in mind, well,

55:46.343 --> 55:48.379
it ain't so much different.

55:48.379 --> 55:51.215
Me and Momma, we like
the same things you do.

55:51.215 --> 55:54.284
Only we take it just
a little bit further.

55:54.284 --> 55:55.119
Fact is,

55:56.086 --> 55:57.287
we're gonna open your eyes up

55:57.287 --> 56:01.058
to things you ain't
never considered before.

56:01.058 --> 56:05.129
(jack moans and grunts in pain)

56:05.129 --> 56:07.398
But don't pay it no never mind.

56:07.398 --> 56:10.234
You ain't going to
last too long anyway,

56:10.234 --> 56:12.737
pretty boys like you never do.

56:15.305 --> 56:16.807
Suppose we best be
getting back to the house

56:16.807 --> 56:18.909
before Momma gets madder.

56:19.910 --> 56:20.845
Come on boy,

56:20.845 --> 56:22.947
we're going to have us some fun.

56:22.947 --> 56:27.117
(suspenseful and
thrilling music)

56:28.719 --> 56:31.388
(loud thumping)

56:32.723 --> 56:36.894
(Jack grunts)
(loud thumping)

57:02.787 --> 57:06.223
(soft and ominous music)

57:52.670 --> 57:55.906
(jack screams in pain)

58:36.714 --> 58:39.784
(door creaks closed)

58:42.687 --> 58:43.621
You crazy fuck.

58:43.621 --> 58:44.855
Stay the hell away from me.

58:44.855 --> 58:46.791
You don't need that with me.

58:46.791 --> 58:48.258
[Jack] The hell I don't.

58:48.258 --> 58:51.028
I'm not here to hurt
you. I'm here to help you.

58:51.028 --> 58:53.363
Then get the
fuck out of my way.

58:53.363 --> 58:54.331
Wait!

58:54.331 --> 58:55.600
My parents,

58:55.600 --> 58:57.835
this land has been in
our family for years.

58:57.835 --> 58:59.904
There are traps
and lures all over.

58:59.904 --> 59:01.138
You won't ever make it.

59:01.138 --> 59:02.139
No one does.

59:03.373 --> 59:06.076
You mean, all these people?

59:06.076 --> 59:08.078
You won't make it
out of here without me.

59:08.078 --> 59:09.847
I know the woods just
as well as they do,

59:09.847 --> 59:11.448
maybe better.

59:11.448 --> 59:13.784
I can get you to the Sheriff.

59:13.784 --> 59:15.385
Why would you help me?

59:15.385 --> 59:17.521
They're monsters!

59:17.521 --> 59:19.757
No one knows that
better than me.

59:19.757 --> 59:22.660
Then why are you
still here then?

59:24.028 --> 59:25.930
I don't have
anywhere else to go.

59:25.930 --> 59:29.266
(low and ominous music)

59:30.134 --> 59:31.201
You can get me out of here?

59:31.201 --> 59:32.703
Yes.

59:32.703 --> 59:34.404
What do you want in return?

59:34.404 --> 59:35.640
Take me with you,

59:35.640 --> 59:36.774
take me to the city.

59:36.774 --> 59:38.108
Wherever you go.

59:41.912 --> 59:43.914
I'm nothing like them.

59:43.914 --> 59:45.182
Please.

59:45.182 --> 59:48.352
You need me just as
much as I need you.

59:52.122 --> 59:52.957
Okay.

59:54.391 --> 59:57.427
You promise? You promise
you'll take me with you?

59:57.427 --> 59:58.395
Lady, if you get
me out of here,

59:58.395 --> 59:59.730
I'll take you to London, Paris,

59:59.730 --> 01:00:01.732
anywhere you want to go.

01:00:03.067 --> 01:00:04.301
I knew it.

01:00:04.301 --> 01:00:05.369
I knew it when I
saw you yesterday

01:00:05.369 --> 01:00:07.071
that you would be the one.

01:00:07.071 --> 01:00:08.072
We need to hurry.

01:00:08.072 --> 01:00:09.506
Yeah we should.

01:00:10.641 --> 01:00:11.575
Well let's get going.

01:00:11.575 --> 01:00:12.309
They could be here any minute.

01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:13.410
We should go.

01:00:13.410 --> 01:00:14.411
Mmm, baby.

01:00:16.546 --> 01:00:17.982
We need to,

01:00:17.982 --> 01:00:19.416
they could be here any minute.

01:00:19.416 --> 01:00:20.550
You need to calm down.

01:00:20.550 --> 01:00:22.052
Calm down?

01:00:22.052 --> 01:00:23.854
[Jack] We need to focus
on getting back to town.

01:00:23.854 --> 01:00:25.422
That's all you
care about isn't it?

01:00:25.422 --> 01:00:26.924
At the moment? Yeah,
that pretty much covers it.

01:00:26.924 --> 01:00:28.893
What about me? Were
you just using me?

01:00:28.893 --> 01:00:29.960
What?

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:31.328
You promised.

01:00:31.328 --> 01:00:33.463
You promised we
would be together.

01:00:33.463 --> 01:00:34.732
How could you lie
to me like that?

01:00:34.732 --> 01:00:36.033
Keep your voice down.

01:00:36.033 --> 01:00:37.367
You're a liar.

01:00:38.268 --> 01:00:41.672
You're a liar! (Mumbles)

01:00:44.108 --> 01:00:45.309
(sudden smack)
(Jack grunts in pain)

01:00:45.309 --> 01:00:49.113
(erratic and suspenseful
electronic music)

01:00:52.082 --> 01:00:55.085
Please. Baby please.

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:57.154
Come back.

01:01:00.791 --> 01:01:02.226
Please.

01:01:02.226 --> 01:01:05.062
You said we'd be
together forever.

01:01:09.399 --> 01:01:10.835
Please come back.

01:01:12.236 --> 01:01:13.070
Please.

01:01:32.189 --> 01:01:35.125
I'm going to fucking
kill you, city boy.

01:01:35.125 --> 01:01:36.393
Please.

01:01:36.393 --> 01:01:37.728
Where are you?

01:01:37.728 --> 01:01:39.529
We'd be together forever.

01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:40.364
Forever!

01:01:42.767 --> 01:01:43.600
Come back!

01:01:46.003 --> 01:01:46.837
Come back!

01:01:48.572 --> 01:01:49.539
Baby, please!

01:01:49.539 --> 01:01:51.942
We're supposed to be together.

01:01:55.379 --> 01:01:57.381
Supposed to be together.

01:02:01.752 --> 01:02:03.754
Supposed to be together.

01:02:05.956 --> 01:02:07.491
You promised that
we'd be together.

01:02:07.491 --> 01:02:08.759
I'm gonna fucking hurt you,

01:02:08.759 --> 01:02:10.094
I'll gut you like a fucking fish

01:02:10.094 --> 01:02:12.096
with this machete I got.

01:02:24.909 --> 01:02:27.311
I'm gonna fucking
kill you, city boy.

01:02:27.311 --> 01:02:31.315
I got you right where I
want you in these woods.

01:02:32.783 --> 01:02:36.854
(thrilling and suspenseful
electronic music)

01:02:36.854 --> 01:02:39.623
(loud thuds)

01:02:39.623 --> 01:02:41.291
You're so beautiful.

01:02:44.161 --> 01:02:46.763
(low grunting)

01:02:53.904 --> 01:02:56.974
(knife slices flesh)

01:02:58.375 --> 01:03:00.044
Why did this happen?

01:03:01.745 --> 01:03:04.348
You were supposed to love me.

01:03:04.348 --> 01:03:06.683
We were supposed to
go away together.

01:03:06.683 --> 01:03:07.517
You must

01:03:08.919 --> 01:03:09.753
love me.

01:03:11.521 --> 01:03:13.958
(Jack pants)

01:03:21.999 --> 01:03:26.170
(intense, oscillating tone)
Love me.

01:04:00.204 --> 01:04:04.341
(erratic and ominous
electronic music)

01:04:21.358 --> 01:04:22.526
You see,

01:04:22.526 --> 01:04:24.861
electricity is
like anything else,

01:04:24.861 --> 01:04:26.730
(phone rings)
if you never really had it,

01:04:26.730 --> 01:04:28.798
you don't really miss it.

01:04:31.468 --> 01:04:33.637
Sheriff's office,
go for Sheriff Westin.

01:04:33.637 --> 01:04:34.638
Thank God.

01:04:35.839 --> 01:04:37.074
You've gotta help me.

01:04:37.074 --> 01:04:39.376
I meet you yesterday
at the grocery store.

01:04:39.376 --> 01:04:40.810
I'm at Myers Rentals.

01:04:40.810 --> 01:04:41.645
You gotta help.

01:04:41.645 --> 01:04:43.347
These people are crazy.

01:04:43.347 --> 01:04:44.281
They're trying to kill me.

01:04:44.281 --> 01:04:45.215
They're murderers.

01:04:45.215 --> 01:04:46.850
They've killed other people.

01:04:46.850 --> 01:04:47.784
They have the girl that I...

01:04:47.784 --> 01:04:49.319
Now slow down, slow down,

01:04:49.319 --> 01:04:51.188
slow down, just a minute there.

01:04:51.188 --> 01:04:52.422
You're the couple I met

01:04:52.422 --> 01:04:53.457
at the general store
yesterday, right?

01:04:53.457 --> 01:04:54.658
Yes.

01:04:54.658 --> 01:04:56.160
They're fucking crazy.

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:57.394
They disabled my car.

01:04:57.394 --> 01:04:58.862
You got to help me.

01:04:58.862 --> 01:04:59.696
Send a team,

01:04:59.696 --> 01:05:00.497
SWAT, whatever.

01:05:00.497 --> 01:05:01.932
You got to come quick.

01:05:01.932 --> 01:05:03.433
Welp.

01:05:03.433 --> 01:05:05.802
I'm currently the only one
in the office right now so.

01:05:05.802 --> 01:05:06.736
Jesus.

01:05:06.736 --> 01:05:07.571
I've gotta get out of here now.

01:05:07.571 --> 01:05:09.073
Okay, listen, listen.

01:05:09.073 --> 01:05:11.375
I can be there in about
10 minutes, alright.?

01:05:11.375 --> 01:05:12.709
You just sit tight
there in that cabin

01:05:12.709 --> 01:05:14.544
and we'll get this
all sorted out.

01:05:14.544 --> 01:05:16.113
No no! I can't stay here.

01:05:16.113 --> 01:05:18.282
How do I get to the highway?
I'll meet you there?

01:05:18.282 --> 01:05:19.549
Okay. Sure, sure,

01:05:19.549 --> 01:05:20.550
I can meet you there.

01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:21.785
I can meet you there.

01:05:21.785 --> 01:05:23.587
I mean, I got some
bad news though,

01:05:23.587 --> 01:05:25.922
the fastest way's there
is through them woods.

01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:28.993
There is a path, if
I remember correctly,

01:05:28.993 --> 01:05:32.596
that oughta follow
out to highway 63.

01:05:32.596 --> 01:05:34.164
Put you out around
mile marker 118.

01:05:34.164 --> 01:05:35.966
I can be there in
about 10 minutes.

01:05:35.966 --> 01:05:36.800
I know the path.

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:37.834
I'm leaving now. Hurry.

01:05:37.834 --> 01:05:41.571
(thrilling electronic music)

01:06:02.993 --> 01:06:06.196
Fuck! No!

01:06:06.196 --> 01:06:07.464
God dammit!

01:06:07.464 --> 01:06:08.365
God dammit!

01:06:10.367 --> 01:06:12.936
Why'd you have to go over there?

01:06:12.936 --> 01:06:15.272
Didn't I tell you
not to go over there?

01:06:15.272 --> 01:06:17.974
You're daddy's little girl.

01:06:17.974 --> 01:06:20.010
I'm gonna skin that boy alive.

01:06:20.010 --> 01:06:21.311
You hear?

01:06:21.311 --> 01:06:24.714
You will always be
daddy's little girl.

01:06:27.151 --> 01:06:28.085
I'll get you a new one.

01:06:28.085 --> 01:06:29.319
I don't want a new one.

01:06:29.319 --> 01:06:31.388
I want this one.

01:06:31.388 --> 01:06:33.690
Remember that old one you had?

01:06:33.690 --> 01:06:34.524
Annie?

01:06:35.959 --> 01:06:37.194
Yes, Annie.

01:06:37.194 --> 01:06:39.563
And you were so sad
when Annie died.

01:06:39.563 --> 01:06:43.567
And then we got Caitlin
and you became so happy?

01:06:44.901 --> 01:06:46.970
We'll get you a new one.

01:06:46.970 --> 01:06:48.805
Pick her up. Let's go.

01:07:04.821 --> 01:07:08.992
(soft rustling)
(suspenseful electronic music)

01:07:22.772 --> 01:07:23.607
Ah fuck.

01:07:28.445 --> 01:07:32.616
(Jack screams)
(suspenseful electronic music)

01:07:38.422 --> 01:07:39.589
What the fuck?

01:07:52.669 --> 01:07:53.737
Sheriff!

01:07:53.737 --> 01:07:55.239
I need your help.

01:07:55.239 --> 01:07:56.072
(grunts) I need your help!

01:07:56.072 --> 01:07:56.973
Calm down, calm down.

01:07:56.973 --> 01:07:57.974
You're okay now.

01:07:57.974 --> 01:07:58.942
You're safe now.

01:07:58.942 --> 01:07:59.776
You're safe.

01:07:59.776 --> 01:08:01.145
Come on, have a seat.

01:08:01.145 --> 01:08:01.978
Here you go.

01:08:01.978 --> 01:08:02.846
Drink some water.

01:08:02.846 --> 01:08:03.847
Thank you.

01:08:07.984 --> 01:08:09.153
You alright?

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:12.489
Pretty nasty cut you got there.

01:08:12.489 --> 01:08:14.258
Might wanna get you
some medical attention.

01:08:14.258 --> 01:08:15.959
No, I'm fine.

01:08:15.959 --> 01:08:17.294
Kristy.

01:08:17.294 --> 01:08:18.127
They still have her.

01:08:18.127 --> 01:08:19.595
Kristy?

01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:22.064
You mean that beautiful
thing you were with earlier?

01:08:22.064 --> 01:08:23.500
[Jack] They still got her.

01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:25.234
Okay, well calm down.

01:08:25.234 --> 01:08:26.069
Everything's going
to be alright.

01:08:26.069 --> 01:08:27.437
We need to go back.

01:08:27.437 --> 01:08:28.272
We gotta go back.

01:08:28.272 --> 01:08:29.473
Okay.

01:08:29.473 --> 01:08:30.807
Calm down.

01:08:30.807 --> 01:08:31.675
Everything's going
to be alright.

01:08:31.675 --> 01:08:32.841
I need to call this in.

01:08:32.841 --> 01:08:33.743
Hang tight.

01:08:38.682 --> 01:08:39.948
This is sheriff Weston

01:08:39.948 --> 01:08:41.951
with disturbance out
of highway 63, over.

01:08:41.951 --> 01:08:43.420
[Dispatcher]
Copy that sheriff.

01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:44.254
Over.

01:08:45.654 --> 01:08:47.191
Looks like I'm going
to need backup over here.

01:08:47.191 --> 01:08:48.925
I got a possible assault,

01:08:48.925 --> 01:08:50.894
a rape, murder,

01:08:50.894 --> 01:08:52.595
and God knows what else.

01:08:52.595 --> 01:08:53.662
[Dispatcher] Copy that.

01:08:53.662 --> 01:08:55.932
So you got him? Over.

01:08:55.932 --> 01:08:56.800
Yeah I got him Momma.

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:58.402
(low, suspenseful music)

01:08:58.402 --> 01:09:00.537
I'm bringin' him in to ya.

01:09:01.938 --> 01:09:04.941
Whoa, whoa where
you're goin' son?

01:09:13.082 --> 01:09:14.718
Please don't do this.

01:09:14.718 --> 01:09:16.553
Ain't no use in begging son.

01:09:16.553 --> 01:09:19.154
You did a very bad thing and
now you get to pay the price.

01:09:19.154 --> 01:09:22.091
(fist smacks face)

01:09:23.227 --> 01:09:25.060
You ain't gonna hit
me with no rock.

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:26.529
Stupid ass Jesse.

01:09:26.529 --> 01:09:27.930
Never was the smartest.

01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:28.997
Huh?

01:09:28.997 --> 01:09:30.334
(low thud)
(Jack screams in pain)

01:09:30.334 --> 01:09:31.401
[Jack] Please stop!

01:09:31.401 --> 01:09:32.902
Yeah, yeah,

01:09:32.902 --> 01:09:34.770
that ain't nothin' compared
to what Momma gonna do to you.

01:09:34.770 --> 01:09:36.506
So you wanna fuck
with her family, huh?

01:09:36.506 --> 01:09:39.542
(Jack screams in pain)
(Tom screams mockingly)

01:09:39.542 --> 01:09:40.377
Scream all you want.

01:09:40.377 --> 01:09:41.310
Scream all you want.

01:09:41.310 --> 01:09:42.746
Can't nobody hear you out here.

01:09:42.746 --> 01:09:45.081
Okay? Ain't nobody hear you.

01:09:46.216 --> 01:09:48.385
(solid thunk)

01:09:48.385 --> 01:09:50.287
Ah come on, come on.

01:09:50.287 --> 01:09:51.988
Don't you go passing
out on me now.

01:09:51.988 --> 01:09:53.022
Wake up son. Wake up.

01:09:53.022 --> 01:09:54.458
Come on. Get up.

01:09:54.458 --> 01:09:55.292
Get up.

01:09:56.526 --> 01:09:58.161
Come on get up.

01:09:58.161 --> 01:09:59.663
(knife slashes flesh)
(thrilling, suspenseful music)

01:09:59.663 --> 01:10:02.999
(Tom gargles and gasps)

01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:22.786
[Momma] Are you
on route? Over?

01:10:25.855 --> 01:10:28.892
I asked you are on route? Over.

01:10:28.892 --> 01:10:30.394
Answer me damn it!

01:10:32.596 --> 01:10:35.031
Your sheriff won't
be taking your call.

01:10:35.031 --> 01:10:36.099
[Momma] I'm going to kill you.

01:10:36.099 --> 01:10:36.933
You hear...

01:10:47.210 --> 01:10:51.214
(soft and ominous guitar music)

01:11:15.939 --> 01:11:20.109
(moves into soft,
suspenseful music)

01:11:28.852 --> 01:11:32.088
(sudden shocking tone)

01:11:58.415 --> 01:12:01.017
(woman screams)

01:12:15.765 --> 01:12:19.936
(fist smacks face)
(woman grunts)

01:12:23.407 --> 01:12:27.577
(knife slices flesh)
(woman screams)

01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:22.165
(thrilling and
suspenseful music)

01:13:22.165 --> 01:13:23.600
Son of a bitch.

01:13:25.268 --> 01:13:26.636
You growed you a
pair of brass ones,

01:13:26.636 --> 01:13:28.572
didn't you city boy?

01:13:28.572 --> 01:13:30.306
I've always had em.

01:13:32.141 --> 01:13:34.478
(men grunt)

01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:46.723
Woo wee! You fast, city boy.

01:13:47.891 --> 01:13:49.225
But it don't matter.

01:13:49.225 --> 01:13:50.560
I've had faster.

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:51.828
You have no idea,

01:13:51.828 --> 01:13:55.064
but you have fucked
with the wrong guy.

01:13:58.367 --> 01:14:00.570
Been a few like you
from time to time,

01:14:00.570 --> 01:14:02.238
always talking shit.

01:14:05.241 --> 01:14:08.578
In the end, even the
tough ones crumble.

01:14:10.179 --> 01:14:11.014
Surprised?

01:14:12.448 --> 01:14:15.852
(men struggle and fight)

01:14:29.833 --> 01:14:31.367
You know,

01:14:31.367 --> 01:14:33.770
I've been wondering.

01:14:33.770 --> 01:14:35.238
Why you do it?

01:14:35.238 --> 01:14:37.006
You're about to
find out, city boy.

01:14:37.006 --> 01:14:37.874
Yeah, sure, okay,

01:14:37.874 --> 01:14:39.175
but really, why?

01:14:39.175 --> 01:14:41.144
I mean, is it sexy to you?

01:14:41.144 --> 01:14:42.612
Does it fill a need?

01:14:42.612 --> 01:14:46.482
Some dark void left over
from your inbred childhood?

01:14:49.285 --> 01:14:51.521
I do because I like it.

01:14:51.521 --> 01:14:53.022
It feels good!

01:14:53.022 --> 01:14:55.759
You about to find out why
it feels so good, city boy.

01:14:55.759 --> 01:14:59.162
I'm gonna enjoy tearing
up your punk ass!

01:15:02.298 --> 01:15:05.368
(Jesse grunts in pain)

01:15:05.368 --> 01:15:08.371
Really? Because it feels good?

01:15:08.371 --> 01:15:10.273
That's your only reason?

01:15:10.273 --> 01:15:12.208
And you do it with your family!

01:15:12.208 --> 01:15:14.978
I mean, that really
threw me off at first.

01:15:14.978 --> 01:15:16.445
I was really scared
there for a second.

01:15:16.445 --> 01:15:18.715
I don't usually let things
get out of control like that.

01:15:18.715 --> 01:15:21.117
You ain't never had control.

01:15:21.117 --> 01:15:23.887
Sure, whatever
makes you feel better.

01:15:23.887 --> 01:15:26.656
Oh, I'm coming for you boy.

01:15:26.656 --> 01:15:29.926
You know, I have been
doing this a long time,

01:15:29.926 --> 01:15:32.461
never come across
anyone like you guys.

01:15:32.461 --> 01:15:34.664
I mean you have a real
mom and pop organization

01:15:34.664 --> 01:15:35.832
going on here.

01:15:35.832 --> 01:15:37.066
See me?

01:15:37.066 --> 01:15:39.335
I've always been more of
a lone wolf, you know?

01:15:39.335 --> 01:15:43.306
I was planning on killing the
woman who brought me here.

01:15:43.306 --> 01:15:44.207
You what?

01:15:45.341 --> 01:15:46.442
Yeah right?

01:15:47.310 --> 01:15:49.278
Fresh air? Seclusion?

01:15:49.278 --> 01:15:52.381
I have never killed
in the country before.

01:15:52.381 --> 01:15:54.818
I was thinking it would be
a nice change of scenery.

01:15:54.818 --> 01:15:58.988
Give it a whole "no one
can hear you scream" motif.

01:15:58.988 --> 01:16:01.557
I love your death ditch
with the lime, by the way.

01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:03.727
It's a good idea, I guess.

01:16:06.495 --> 01:16:10.333
You know, I like you in
a strange kind of way.

01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:13.637
Well, like is a strong word.

01:16:15.071 --> 01:16:18.842
We'll say I admire you as
a colleague and a peer.

01:16:18.842 --> 01:16:20.777
I'll tell you what.

01:16:20.777 --> 01:16:22.612
(knife slices flesh)
(Jesse grunts in pain)

01:16:22.612 --> 01:16:25.181
[Jesse] What the
hell are you doing?

01:16:25.181 --> 01:16:27.784
If I did what I
think I just did,

01:16:27.784 --> 01:16:30.053
I nicked your femoral artery.

01:16:30.053 --> 01:16:32.722
Call it a professional
assessment.

01:16:32.722 --> 01:16:33.923
Eh?

01:16:33.923 --> 01:16:35.391
It's the main
artery in your leg.

01:16:35.391 --> 01:16:38.327
You have about five minutes
until you bleed out.

01:16:38.327 --> 01:16:40.764
Or maybe you find a way
to stop the bleeding.

01:16:40.764 --> 01:16:42.565
You have got to learn to adapt

01:16:42.565 --> 01:16:44.868
if you wanna stay
competitive in this field.

01:16:44.868 --> 01:16:47.436
Otherwise some young guns
is just gonna come in

01:16:47.436 --> 01:16:49.973
and cannibalizing
your territory.

01:16:49.973 --> 01:16:53.242
Metaphorically
speaking of course.

01:16:53.242 --> 01:16:55.378
What the fuck are
you talking about?

01:16:55.378 --> 01:16:56.646
You're going to want
to stay pretty still.

01:16:56.646 --> 01:16:59.716
You're losing a lot of blood.

01:16:59.716 --> 01:17:02.786
You're probably feeling
pretty light headed.

01:17:02.786 --> 01:17:05.088
I probably did some
nerve damage too.

01:17:05.088 --> 01:17:06.189
Sorry.

01:17:06.189 --> 01:17:07.123
Now,

01:17:07.123 --> 01:17:08.792
you stay here and think about

01:17:08.792 --> 01:17:11.661
how you're going to improve
your performance for next time.

01:17:11.661 --> 01:17:14.698
I'm going to go have a nice
little chat with your wife.

01:17:14.698 --> 01:17:17.100
(loud thump)

01:17:26.109 --> 01:17:28.845
(intense and thrilling music)

01:17:28.845 --> 01:17:29.679
Good luck!

01:17:46.395 --> 01:17:48.031
You know,

01:17:48.031 --> 01:17:50.867
being a mother is
a thankless job.

01:17:51.835 --> 01:17:53.469
You wouldn't know it yet

01:17:53.469 --> 01:17:56.405
but trust me, it's
a thankless job.

01:17:57.373 --> 01:17:58.708
Oh, don't worry.

01:17:59.843 --> 01:18:02.645
Jesse's going to be
back with your city boy.

01:18:02.645 --> 01:18:04.748
And then we're
gonna go to a room.

01:18:04.748 --> 01:18:08.051
And we're going
to have some fun.

01:18:08.051 --> 01:18:10.153
Won't that be fun?

01:18:10.153 --> 01:18:12.321
(giggles)

01:18:20.964 --> 01:18:23.032
I did everything for her.

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:28.872
And she still got herself
killed by that pretty city boy.

01:18:28.872 --> 01:18:31.474
I mean I would understand it

01:18:31.474 --> 01:18:34.610
if it was a big man like Jesse.

01:18:34.610 --> 01:18:39.315
Well I guess she would
have gotten herself killed

01:18:39.315 --> 01:18:40.316
by somebody.

01:18:41.751 --> 01:18:43.086
Don't you think?

01:18:44.453 --> 01:18:48.457
(intense and suspenseful music)

01:18:50.827 --> 01:18:52.195
I'm sorry,

01:18:52.195 --> 01:18:53.462
I didn't realize
rednecks had the monopoly

01:18:53.462 --> 01:18:55.664
on killing around here.

01:18:55.664 --> 01:18:57.200
Where's Jesse?

01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:00.103
Oh, he's just working some
stuff out of his system.

01:19:00.103 --> 01:19:02.806
I am gonna gouge
out your eyes.

01:19:04.607 --> 01:19:07.043
(loud smack)

01:19:14.083 --> 01:19:16.085
Oh good, you're awake.

01:19:23.159 --> 01:19:25.728
I was worried I did
some real damage there.

01:19:25.728 --> 01:19:29.165
That would take a lot
of fun out of this.

01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:34.537
Ain't this a son of a bitch?

01:19:34.537 --> 01:19:37.106
Lady, you really know how
to ruin a guy's weekend,

01:19:37.106 --> 01:19:38.842
You know that?

01:19:38.842 --> 01:19:42.245
I'm so sorry I messed
up your vacation.

01:19:44.347 --> 01:19:47.183
Kristy, I had
big plans for her.

01:19:50.954 --> 01:19:52.121
Oh, do tell.

01:19:54.157 --> 01:19:56.926
Most girls I meet online

01:19:56.926 --> 01:19:58.161
are ready to go on a date

01:19:58.161 --> 01:19:59.728
before I even have
the time to come up

01:19:59.728 --> 01:20:01.797
with a decent back story.

01:20:03.532 --> 01:20:07.503
I've never done that
myself, so I don't know.

01:20:07.503 --> 01:20:11.107
Kristy, she took
some convincing.

01:20:11.107 --> 01:20:13.109
Finally she agree to a date.

01:20:13.109 --> 01:20:14.543
She had this whole
scheme worked out

01:20:14.543 --> 01:20:15.578
where we were going

01:20:15.578 --> 01:20:17.180
just get away from it all.

01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:19.782
You know, really get
to know each other.

01:20:19.782 --> 01:20:22.986
And you know what? I liked it.

01:20:22.986 --> 01:20:25.554
I really could've
used a nice getaway.

01:20:25.554 --> 01:20:29.525
Well nature can be a
soothing to the soul.

01:20:29.525 --> 01:20:32.661
I was having a
really good time.

01:20:32.661 --> 01:20:33.729
But you guys,

01:20:34.663 --> 01:20:37.166
man, I did not see you coming.

01:20:39.802 --> 01:20:42.371
Sorry to mess up
your plans, city boy.

01:20:42.371 --> 01:20:43.873
What I was really
looking forward to

01:20:43.873 --> 01:20:45.808
was just cutting loose.

01:20:46.943 --> 01:20:49.212
Really hearing them scream.

01:20:50.646 --> 01:20:53.382
Well, no point in wasting
a good opportunity.

01:20:53.382 --> 01:20:57.553
(loud smack)
(striking guitar chord)

01:21:00.056 --> 01:21:01.824
You punch 'em first?

01:21:03.927 --> 01:21:05.861
You gotta take it slow.

01:21:07.730 --> 01:21:09.966
You gotta make them scream.

01:21:12.235 --> 01:21:13.836
You've got a knife?

01:21:15.638 --> 01:21:18.507
Otherwise you were the
one who was lecturing me

01:21:18.507 --> 01:21:20.776
about wasted opportunities.

01:21:26.182 --> 01:21:29.285
Oh yes. Yes.

01:21:31.154 --> 01:21:34.657
That's much more better.

01:21:39.162 --> 01:21:41.530
All that talking you
were doing earlier.

01:21:41.530 --> 01:21:43.099
That was all right.

01:21:44.033 --> 01:21:45.701
See,

01:21:45.701 --> 01:21:47.536
that lets them know
you've got plenty of time

01:21:47.536 --> 01:21:49.372
and you're in no rush.

01:21:52.108 --> 01:21:53.943
Starts making it clear

01:21:54.843 --> 01:21:57.146
they are in for a long ride.

01:21:59.515 --> 01:22:01.617
Your instincts were right.

01:22:04.253 --> 01:22:06.589
But you did one thing wrong.

01:22:07.957 --> 01:22:11.394
You know when you're talking
about all that stuff?

01:22:11.394 --> 01:22:13.162
You gotta touch them.

01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:15.531
All over,

01:22:15.531 --> 01:22:18.867
in all those places they
never wanna be touched in.

01:22:18.867 --> 01:22:20.103
You touch them.

01:22:22.238 --> 01:22:24.740
Remember me doing that to you?

01:22:25.641 --> 01:22:26.709
Creepy right?

01:22:31.114 --> 01:22:33.949
That shows them
who has the power,

01:22:34.850 --> 01:22:36.285
who's in control.

01:22:39.088 --> 01:22:42.758
It really adds to the
sense of helplessness.

01:22:54.103 --> 01:22:56.505
(moans) Yes.

01:22:58.841 --> 01:22:59.675
Yes.

01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:01.510
That's it.

01:23:04.913 --> 01:23:05.748
Yeah.

01:23:12.921 --> 01:23:14.190
You're getting off on this?

01:23:14.190 --> 01:23:17.660
Being touched by the man
who killed your husband?

01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:18.827
What? Jesse?

01:23:21.864 --> 01:23:23.599
He always comes back.

01:23:24.567 --> 01:23:25.901
Not this time.

01:23:30.773 --> 01:23:33.442
(Momma giggles)

01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:39.014
That's much better.

01:23:39.982 --> 01:23:41.817
You're getting it now.

01:23:42.785 --> 01:23:45.888
It's just not about the knife,

01:23:45.888 --> 01:23:49.525
everything about
you is the weapon.

01:23:49.525 --> 01:23:50.726
I know what I'm doing.

01:23:50.726 --> 01:23:52.228
I've been doing this
for a long time.

01:23:52.228 --> 01:23:53.862
I've been killing longer
than you've been alive.

01:23:53.862 --> 01:23:55.598
I saw the pictures
in the cabin.

01:23:55.598 --> 01:23:57.433
Caitlin told me those
were your victims.

01:23:57.433 --> 01:24:00.436
I've killed many more
people than that.

01:24:00.436 --> 01:24:01.837
Darling,

01:24:01.837 --> 01:24:04.707
I own five cabins on this land,

01:24:04.707 --> 01:24:08.377
every cabin has a mantle
just like that one.

01:24:23.492 --> 01:24:26.829
I've never met
anyone like you before.

01:24:27.896 --> 01:24:29.532
Like me.

01:24:29.532 --> 01:24:33.702
(thrilling and
suspenseful music)

01:24:39.342 --> 01:24:40.176
Momma?

01:24:40.176 --> 01:24:41.009
Hi baby.

01:24:42.678 --> 01:24:45.013
(men grunt)

01:24:50.319 --> 01:24:51.154
Stop!

01:24:53.756 --> 01:24:56.425
Leave daddy alone!

01:25:07.069 --> 01:25:09.805
No one knows you're here.

01:25:09.805 --> 01:25:12.308
She made all the reservations.

01:25:14.009 --> 01:25:18.314
We never met until I
came over to your house.

01:25:18.314 --> 01:25:19.648
Online dating.

01:25:25.721 --> 01:25:28.056
(loud thud)

01:25:41.570 --> 01:25:43.105
Ooo wee!

01:25:43.105 --> 01:25:45.974
That is the most fun I've
ever had at a gas station.

01:25:45.974 --> 01:25:46.975
We got some goodies for you.

01:25:46.975 --> 01:25:47.810
Here you go.
Thanks Momma.

01:25:47.810 --> 01:25:49.144
I love these.

01:25:49.144 --> 01:25:51.414
I know you do honey, I know.

01:25:51.414 --> 01:25:52.715
And, we got one for your friend.

01:25:52.715 --> 01:25:55.218
(intense and energetic
heavy metal music)

01:25:55.218 --> 01:25:57.320
Thanks Momma.
(Momma laughs)

01:25:57.320 --> 01:25:59.021
Why was the gas
station so fun?

01:25:59.021 --> 01:26:00.556
We got it all on video.

01:26:00.556 --> 01:26:02.725
Here, have a look.

01:26:02.725 --> 01:26:03.659
Man, what are you doing?

01:26:03.659 --> 01:26:04.827
What the fuck are you doing?

01:26:04.827 --> 01:26:05.794
What are you doing?

01:26:05.794 --> 01:26:06.629
Come on.

01:26:06.629 --> 01:26:08.030
Come on, goddamn it!

01:26:08.030 --> 01:26:10.366
What the fuck are you doing?

01:26:14.837 --> 01:26:16.472
Just take the fucking money.

01:26:16.472 --> 01:26:17.940
Please, please!

01:26:17.940 --> 01:26:18.774
Don't! Don't!

01:26:18.774 --> 01:26:21.176
(loud smack)

01:26:25.814 --> 01:26:29.818
(fist smacks man consecutively)

01:26:38.927 --> 01:26:40.496
You don't even have to do this.

01:26:40.496 --> 01:26:41.564
You don't have to
do this at all!

01:26:41.564 --> 01:26:43.866
Come on, man! Please man!

01:26:43.866 --> 01:26:46.369
You don't even have to do all.

01:26:50.839 --> 01:26:54.176
(knife shanks silently)

01:27:06.955 --> 01:27:11.126
* Just be glad you
shot me when you did

01:27:12.661 --> 01:27:15.831
* 'Cause you hither had've made

01:27:15.831 --> 01:27:19.635
* Would've not been kind of you

01:27:19.635 --> 01:27:23.572
* To see her gray
and all that lonely

01:27:23.572 --> 01:27:26.975
* Would've made me desire

01:27:26.975 --> 01:27:31.146
* 'Cause still on my
lips and my tongue

01:27:57.540 --> 01:28:01.644
* To see a man slowly
take his own life

01:28:03.412 --> 01:28:07.583
* And watch it wash
away in oceans of fear

01:28:09.918 --> 01:28:13.856
* Does sinner have
a name for himself

01:28:13.856 --> 01:28:17.426
* As he lies, I cry

01:28:17.426 --> 01:28:21.597
* And the world is
self loathing and piss

01:28:24.567 --> 01:28:28.637
* As of right now, I'm lonely

01:28:28.637 --> 01:28:31.707
* Yes in their world

01:28:42.885 --> 01:28:47.055
* Our dear, now I'm
glad you ever would show

01:28:47.923 --> 01:28:50.859
* The chills that I had

01:28:50.859 --> 01:28:54.597
* And I brought it all for you

01:28:54.597 --> 01:28:57.366
* I know that sort of fear

01:28:57.366 --> 01:29:00.669
* The bullet hole to blame

01:29:00.669 --> 01:29:03.572
* And tell it to the law

01:29:03.572 --> 01:29:07.342
* That I saw that hole

01:29:07.342 --> 01:29:09.111
* I never did

01:29:09.111 --> 01:29:13.215
* As of right now, I'm lonely

01:29:13.215 --> 01:29:16.318
* Yes in their world

01:29:17.305 --> 01:29:23.282
