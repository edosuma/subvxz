a great life.

17:47.100 --> 17:49.734
I want to be the man
that your daughter deserves.

17:52.005 --> 17:54.105
Kyle, this is, of course,
a big decision.

17:54.107 --> 17:55.706
It's all up to you
what you do,

17:55.708 --> 17:59.610
but if you're waiting to become
the man that Mandy deserves,

17:59.612 --> 18:02.080
I think you are that man.

18:04.050 --> 18:05.550
Thank you, sir.

18:05.552 --> 18:08.252
A-and you should know
that when the time comes,

18:08.254 --> 18:10.621
I would never
ask Mandy to marry me

18:10.623 --> 18:11.889
without getting
your permission first.

18:11.891 --> 18:13.291
Damn right!

18:15.261 --> 18:16.928
But I appreciate that.
[ Door opens ]

18:16.930 --> 18:18.229
I really do.

18:18.231 --> 18:20.465
Hey, Kyle.
Can we talk?

18:24.270 --> 18:26.070
Honey,
let's get some coffee.

18:26.072 --> 18:28.840
No, you go.
I want to hear this.

18:30.577 --> 18:33.044
Okay!
Geez!

18:35.715 --> 18:39.083
Look, I'm -- I'm sorry about
the ring that wasn't for you.

18:39.085 --> 18:40.985
I'm sorry about the cheesecake
you didn't get to eat.

18:40.987 --> 18:41.986
[ Chuckles ]

18:41.988 --> 18:43.254
Yeah,
it was a weird night.

18:43.256 --> 18:45.389
[ Chuckles ] You thought
I was gonna ask you to marry me.

18:45.391 --> 18:46.791
Yeah.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.226
And you got upset
when I didn't.

18:48.228 --> 18:49.494
Yes.

18:49.496 --> 18:50.595
And embarrassed
and humiliated.

18:50.597 --> 18:53.931
Yep, yeah, I know.
I was there, Kyle.

18:53.933 --> 18:57.468
I remember
the whole thing.

18:57.470 --> 19:00.104
But, you know,
I realized something

19:00.106 --> 19:02.273
when I was talking
to mom.

19:02.275 --> 19:05.276
I had no reason
to be embarrassed.

19:05.278 --> 19:09.180
I love you,
and I will be perfectly happy

19:09.182 --> 19:13.151
just staying like this
for the rest of our lives.

19:13.153 --> 19:15.386
Well, I won't be.

19:16.656 --> 19:17.955
What are you doing?

19:17.957 --> 19:22.160
This was my mother's.

19:22.162 --> 19:23.594
It's beautiful.

19:23.596 --> 19:25.096
Next to you,

19:25.098 --> 19:28.099
it's the thing that means
the most to me in my life.

19:29.169 --> 19:30.434
[ Chuckles ]

19:33.339 --> 19:34.872
[ Breathes shakily ]

19:34.874 --> 19:36.941
Mandy Baxter...

19:38.311 --> 19:39.310
Oh, shoot.
Hang on.

19:39.312 --> 19:40.444
I got to ask your dad
something.

19:41.981 --> 19:42.980
No, no, no, no, no.

19:42.982 --> 19:43.981
I'm good. Vanessa's good.
[ Vanessa sobs ]

19:43.983 --> 19:45.650
We're all good in here.

19:45.652 --> 19:47.585
Thank you, sir.

19:50.123 --> 19:53.357
Mandy Baxter,
will you marry me?

19:54.661 --> 19:55.693
Yes.
[ Chuckles ]

19:55.695 --> 19:58.062
[ Laughing ]
Yes, Kyle, yes.

20:06.372 --> 20:08.406
Isn't love beautiful?

20:08.408 --> 20:10.041
Yeah.
[ Sobs ]

20:10.043 --> 20:11.542
Young love is. Come on.
[ Sobbing ]

20:11.544 --> 20:13.010
Come on,
let's get you cleaned up.

20:13.012 --> 20:14.579
Come on, come on.

20:22.689 --> 20:25.056
Hey, Mike Baxter
for Outdoor Man.

20:25.058 --> 20:26.657
During the mating season,

20:26.659 --> 20:29.727
the call of the bull elk
begins deep, resonant,

20:29.729 --> 20:33.698
and then becomes a high-pitched
squeal before ending in a grunt.

20:33.700 --> 20:36.767
Sound familiar, ladies?

20:36.769 --> 20:39.237
Elk don't choose
their mating season.

20:39.239 --> 20:42.873
Well,
this guy certainly doesn't.

20:42.875 --> 20:45.009
Only humans
pick their mating season,

20:45.011 --> 20:46.277
unless you're a human

20:46.279 --> 20:48.079
who spends a lot of time
waiting in line at comic-con.

20:48.081 --> 20:52.416
[ Chuckling ] Then your
mating season may never come.

20:52.418 --> 20:54.685
How do we know it's
the right time to get married?

20:54.687 --> 20:56.554
Are we far enough
on the path?

20:56.556 --> 20:58.222
Do we have enough money?

20:58.224 --> 21:03.127
Is kanye really ready
to settle down?

21:03.129 --> 21:06.964
Kanye.

21:06.966 --> 21:08.766
Maybe there is no right time.

21:08.768 --> 21:11.235
There's only the right person,
and when you find her,

21:11.237 --> 21:13.237
you hold onto her
and treat her good,

21:13.239 --> 21:14.639
because if you don't,

21:14.641 --> 21:17.742
her dad will get his good pal,
the fish-and-game warden,

21:17.744 --> 21:21.879
to issue him a license for
a one-day son-in-law season.

21:21.881 --> 21:24.915
That's not a real thing,
is it?

21:24.917 --> 21:26.617
I don't know.

21:26.619 --> 21:27.718
<i> Is</i> it?
