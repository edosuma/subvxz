Morning, Peter.

00:38.839 --> 00:40.539
Hey, listen, I-I got to
ask you something.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.341
Last night, I heard,
uh, the song

00:42.343 --> 00:43.909
"Pour Some Sugar On Me,"

00:43.911 --> 00:46.178
and-and this question
popped into my head.

00:46.180 --> 00:48.914
Are you-- and please say
yes-- are you related--

00:48.916 --> 00:51.350
and even if you're not, please
say yes-- are you related to--

00:51.352 --> 00:53.318
and please say yes
because I need the attention

00:53.320 --> 00:56.188
from my friends-- are you
related to Def Leppard?

00:56.190 --> 00:57.890
Griffin, can I talk
to you privately?

00:57.892 --> 00:59.725
Stella, turn around.

00:59.727 --> 01:02.728
You know, that is one nice thing
about having a deaf coworker.

01:02.730 --> 01:05.197
Well, that and I can work
on my verbal sound effects

01:05.199 --> 01:06.532
and not feel
self-conscious about

01:06.534 --> 01:08.000
the ones that aren't
quite there yet.

01:08.002 --> 01:09.902
What are you talking about?

01:09.904 --> 01:12.571
I'm talking about this:
shabba dabba dabba dabba dabba.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.239
That's a helicopter
hovering over a woman

01:14.241 --> 01:15.541
swimming in her pool.

01:15.543 --> 01:16.708
I also do animals.

01:16.710 --> 01:17.943
Here's a mouse.

01:17.945 --> 01:19.845
(high-pitched):
Mouse?

01:19.847 --> 01:21.346
Oh, that one's ready.

01:21.348 --> 01:23.115
Griffin, I actually
came to tell you

01:23.117 --> 01:25.751
that you're being promoted
to forklift operator.

01:25.753 --> 01:27.052
Really? That's awesome!

01:27.054 --> 01:29.021
Yeah, Frank retired, and
since you're already required

01:29.023 --> 01:30.289
to wear a helmet here--

01:30.291 --> 01:31.957
which, by the way,
put on your helmet.

01:31.959 --> 01:33.125
Oh, sorry.

01:33.127 --> 01:34.960
Anyway, the job is yours.

01:34.962 --> 01:36.962
Which means you'll be
receiving a five percent raise.

01:36.964 --> 01:38.597
Wow, a raise!

01:38.599 --> 01:41.033

afford to set up this cutaway

I could chug that,

but I never tried 'cause
I figured I couldn't lift it.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.086
Until now.

06:28.088 --> 06:30.021
Are you nuts?
No way you can chug that.

06:30.023 --> 06:31.490
No, I can totally do it.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.467
Eh, see if I care.

07:15.469 --> 07:17.102
Hello, COBRA?

07:17.104 --> 07:20.772

search going, Dad?

07:29.650 --> 07:30.715

07:30.717 --> 07:32.050

at the paper right now.

07:32.052 --> 07:33.418

you think a Sagittarius pays?

07:35.889 --> 07:37.756

the wrong section, Peter.

07:37.758 --> 07:39.391
Oh, pardon me.

07:39.393 --> 07:41.560
Oh, looks like
the Dodgers just cut Peña.

07:41.562 --> 07:42.561
Might be something there.

07:42.563 --> 07:44.095

the paper down.

07:44.097 --> 07:45.597
Okay, kids,
off to school.

07:45.599 --> 07:46.798
Now, I know
it's picture day,

07:46.800 --> 07:48.300
but we can't
afford them anymore,

07:48.302 --> 07:49.835
so just run
behind another kid

07:49.837 --> 07:51.903
when they're getting
their picture taken.

07:55.775 --> 07:58.310
Peter, we should talk
about this job situation.

07:58.312 --> 07:59.811
Our savings are
getting pretty low.

07:59.813 --> 08:00.912
You know,
actually, Peter,

08:00.914 --> 08:02.314
there's a lot
of job training programs

08:02.316 --> 08:03.415
sponsored by the state

08:03.417 --> 08:05.283
that could help you
get the skills you need

08:05.285 --> 08:06.318
for another occupation.

08:06.320 --> 08:07.919
You know, Brian,
you could get a job.

08:07.921 --> 08:09.154
I have a job.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.356
I-I'm a writer, Peter.
I'm working right now.

08:11.358 --> 08:12.524
See this,
all of this?

08:12.526 --> 08:14.926
This is the raw material
of a picture of life

08:14.928 --> 08:16.628
that I'm gonna
paint with words.

08:16.630 --> 08:18.430
Yesterday, it took you
30 minutes

08:18.432 --> 08:20.265
to lap up a cold cut
off the floor.

08:20.267 --> 08:21.967
That's my process!

08:21.969 --> 08:23.168
It's been three weeks

08:23.170 --> 08:24.803
and you haven't had
a single job lead.

08:24.805 --> 08:25.971
Oh, that's not true.

08:25.973 --> 08:28.540
I came really close
with that job at the school.

08:28.542 --> 08:30.175
So, what makes you want
to be a crossing guard?

08:30.177 --> 08:31.810
I don't know, I just
thought it would be cool

08:31.812 --> 08:35.280
to decide which kids do
and don't get hit by a car.

08:35.282 --> 08:38.016
Well, Peter, since you've been
having such a tough time,

08:38.018 --> 08:41.019
I was thinking, maybe I
should look for a job.

08:41.021 --> 08:43.955
Lois, I'll be damned if I will
let my wife be a prostitute.

08:43.957 --> 08:46.391
What? No, I'll get
a regular job.

08:46.393 --> 08:48.360
(laughs) What,
like a lawyer?

08:48.362 --> 08:51.663
Peter, there are jobs for women
between prostitute and lawyer.

08:51.665 --> 08:52.697
Wartime nurse?

08:52.699 --> 08:53.732
We need money.

08:53.734 --> 08:55.166
I'm gonna look
for a job.

08:55.168 --> 08:57.869
(sighs) I guess you should;
and that'll give me more time

08:57.871 --> 09:00.238
to focus on expanding
my record collection.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.240
How's this one?
Oh, Bach.

09:02.242 --> 09:03.975
Is very good.
I recommend.

09:03.977 --> 09:04.976
And this one?

09:04.978 --> 09:06.511
Oh, Mozart.

09:06.513 --> 09:07.812
The boy genius.

09:07.814 --> 09:08.847
The best.

09:08.849 --> 09:09.848
Okay, how about this?

09:09.850 --> 09:11.483
Ooh, Debussy.

09:11.485 --> 09:12.918
I love Debussy.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.654
Sometimes all I can
think about is Debussy.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.322
Oh, look at the pianist.

09:17.324 --> 09:19.558
The pianist is so good
with Debussy.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.059
So, you like
his early work?

09:21.061 --> 09:23.028
Oh, yes,
when Debussy was young,

09:23.030 --> 09:24.596
that's when
you want Debussy.

09:24.598 --> 09:25.897
Okay, I'll
take these two.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.032
Very good, sir.

09:27.034 --> 09:29.568
Just make sure
you finish on the Bach.

09:29.570 --> 09:31.403
Never finish on Debussy.

10:12.312 --> 10:13.778

talked about.

10:23.156 --> 10:25.590

be out of the house working,

10:25.592 --> 10:28.093
you're gonna have to take over
for me in the house.

10:28.095 --> 10:29.928

I-I got to do what you do?

10:29.930 --> 10:32.063
Spending the whole day
taking Tylenol PMs

10:32.065 --> 10:33.798
and straddling
the bath faucet?

10:33.800 --> 10:36.134
Well, the guy knows what's going
on here, I'll give him that.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.970
No, I mean, you're gonna need to
cook the meals and do laundry

10:38.972 --> 10:41.106
and take care of Stewie,
like I've been doing.

10:41.108 --> 10:42.107
Are you serious?

10:42.109 --> 10:43.008

run the house?

10:43.010 --> 10:44.275
Hey, I can do it.

10:44.277 --> 10:46.444
I mean, it can't be
any harder than that job

10:46.446 --> 10:48.279
I used to have
at the bowling alley.

10:48.281 --> 10:49.280
Bowlarama.

10:49.282 --> 10:50.915
Yes, we're open.

10:50.917 --> 10:53.151
Oh, yes, we have a wide
selection of balls

10:53.153 --> 10:55.954
that are way too heavy
or have too-small finger holes.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.956
Uh, no, you will not
be able to do anything

10:57.958 --> 11:00.291
with your wrist
for seven days afterward.

11:00.293 --> 11:02.861
Yes, sir, all of the joysticks
in the arcade

11:02.863 --> 11:05.430
are completely covered in pizza
grease, no worries there.

11:05.432 --> 11:06.765
What's that?

11:06.767 --> 11:09.300
Oh, absolutely, there is always
a group of teenagers

11:09.302 --> 11:11.870
throwing the ball real hard
and scaring everyone.

11:11.872 --> 11:15.140
No, there is no smoking,
but we do let you smoke.

11:15.142 --> 11:17.409
Yes, it's all terrible,
come on down.

11:22.782 --> 11:24.349
Why are you doing laundry
in the dishwasher?

11:24.351 --> 11:26.017
Oh, I can't use
the washing machine;

11:26.019 --> 11:27.552
it's really been
acting up lately.

11:28.988 --> 11:30.121
What the hell?

11:30.123 --> 11:32.190
What's going on
down here?

11:32.192 --> 11:33.658
This is washing
machine stuff.

11:33.660 --> 11:35.527
Go back upstairs,
suck-bag.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.633
All right, Stewie, I'm gonna
change your diaper now.

11:41.635 --> 11:44.302
Which, unfortunately, means
I have to touch your privates.

11:44.304 --> 11:46.738
All right, so here I
come with the cloth.

11:46.740 --> 11:48.840
Okay? This is
not sexual.

11:48.842 --> 11:52.010
All right, I've made contact
with your undercarriage.

11:52.012 --> 11:54.079
I am moving it upwards
with a cupped hand.

11:54.081 --> 11:55.847
I'm looking you
in the eye now.

11:55.849 --> 11:57.148
Please meet my gaze.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.416
And we're done.

11:58.418 --> 12:01.152
That was intense.

12:03.489 --> 12:05.190
All right, kids,
you are really gonna love

12:05.192 --> 12:07.158
these Cornish game hens
I cooked for dinner.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.160
Now, I don't want
to pat myself on the back,

12:09.162 --> 12:11.529
but I worked all day
getting 'em just right...

12:11.531 --> 12:12.931
Holy crap!

12:13.432 --> 12:14.532
Oh, my God.

12:14.534 --> 12:15.934
Then that means...

12:17.069 --> 12:18.737
And that also means...

12:21.874 --> 12:23.074
You know what, Peter?

12:23.076 --> 12:26.111
You tried hard, and you
still earned that wine.

12:31.016 --> 12:33.017
I'm home.

12:33.019 --> 12:35.053
Wow, Peter,
the house looks amazing.

12:35.055 --> 12:36.521
Yeah, well, let's
take off our shoes

12:36.523 --> 12:38.223
and try to keep
it that way, huh?

12:38.225 --> 12:40.558
No, really, Peter,
it seems like you've really

12:40.560 --> 12:42.093
taken to being
a househusband.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.728
Well, it hasn't
been easy.

12:43.730 --> 12:44.929
Between doing the
laundry and vacuuming,

12:44.931 --> 12:47.232
I barely had time to
put on a nice sweater

12:47.234 --> 12:49.834
and clasp a cup of
tea with two hands.

12:53.105 --> 12:55.173
(sighs):
Ah.

12:56.909 --> 12:59.244
And now to tie this sweater
around my waist

12:59.246 --> 13:01.479
and walk around
the neighborhood.

13:01.481 --> 13:03.715
Well, what do you say
I reward you

13:03.717 --> 13:05.150
for all your hard work?

13:05.152 --> 13:06.885
Geez, Lois, is that
all you think about?

13:06.887 --> 13:07.952
I'm tired.

13:07.954 --> 13:08.987
Come on, Peter.

13:08.989 --> 13:09.988
I need this release.

13:09.990 --> 13:11.322
I had a long
day at work.

13:11.324 --> 13:12.924
Oh, work.

13:12.926 --> 13:14.459
I suppose work
is why you missed

13:14.461 --> 13:16.060
Chris's father-son picnic.

13:16.062 --> 13:18.129
Peter, you're still
Chris's father.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.297
Why can't you just listen

13:19.299 --> 13:21.166
instead of trying
to fix everything?!

13:22.601 --> 13:23.735
Get in here, Peter.

13:23.737 --> 13:25.103
Don't you want to have sex?

13:25.105 --> 13:27.939
I don't think we've done it
since I started working.

13:27.941 --> 13:29.274
Yeah, I guess you're right.

13:29.276 --> 13:32.844
Come on, where's my big,
strong man?

13:32.846 --> 13:35.814
Putting on one of your
dress shirts to look sexy.

13:37.583 --> 13:39.184
(purrs)

13:39.186 --> 13:40.451
Mmm.

13:40.453 --> 13:42.587
I want to do it on top
of the comforter.

13:42.589 --> 13:44.088
I don't care if
we make streaks.

13:44.090 --> 13:45.323
Well, of course <i>you</i> don't,

13:45.325 --> 13:46.958
you're not the one
who cleans it.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.294
Peter, just shut
up and take me!

13:49.296 --> 13:51.362
(both grunting)

13:53.632 --> 13:54.999
Peter, get up! Get up!

13:55.001 --> 13:56.634
There's a caterpillar
in the bed!

13:56.636 --> 13:58.703
Oh, that's, uh...
that's me.

13:58.705 --> 13:59.771
What?

13:59.773 --> 14:01.306
How do I put this
delicately?

14:01.308 --> 14:04.809
My hog cannot partake
in the slop this evening.

14:04.811 --> 14:08.179
Peter, are you having
trouble getting... ready?

14:08.181 --> 14:10.114
Yes, obviously,
I'm having trouble!

14:10.116 --> 14:12.050
Well, somebody's gonna
have sex with me.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.151
Lois, don't say that.

14:13.153 --> 14:15.220
Quagmire will show up
like the Road Runner.

14:18.791 --> 14:21.125
It's okay, your vagina's
just a painted-on hole.

14:29.235 --> 14:31.069
Oh, Peter,
you're up.

14:31.071 --> 14:32.470
That's not
what I heard.

14:32.472 --> 14:34.372
(both laugh)

14:34.374 --> 14:35.907
Hey, Peter, you want
a little something

14:35.909 --> 14:37.141
to put in that
orange juice?

14:37.143 --> 14:38.176
What? Why? It's 9:00 a.m.

14:38.178 --> 14:39.477
Well, I
figured you'd

14:39.479 --> 14:41.145
like to start your day
with a stiff one.

14:41.147 --> 14:42.714
(laughter)

14:42.716 --> 14:44.082
You can't
get a boner!

14:44.084 --> 14:46.818
You're a failure as
a man and a father.

14:46.820 --> 14:49.020
Peter, it's nothing
to get upset about.

14:49.022 --> 14:50.555
There's treatments
available.

14:50.557 --> 14:51.923
We'll go see
Dr. Hartman.

14:51.925 --> 14:53.992
I don't want to do that;
I'm embarrassed.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.693
This shouldn't
embarrass you.

14:55.695 --> 14:57.996
The size should
embarrass you.

15:02.768 --> 15:05.003
How about now? Is this
doing anything for you?

15:05.005 --> 15:06.037
No.

15:06.039 --> 15:09.407
Hmm. Well, what if
I show you my tattoo?

15:10.776 --> 15:12.277
Nothing.
Well, you got
a dead rat

15:12.279 --> 15:13.378
in your
pants, mister.

15:13.380 --> 15:15.013
There's got to be
something you can do,

15:15.015 --> 15:16.047
Dr. Hartman.

15:16.049 --> 15:17.682
Have you tried
getting a divorce?

15:17.684 --> 15:19.851
I've never seen this
problem in a single man.

15:19.853 --> 15:22.053
Doctor, what about
Viagra or Cialis?

15:22.055 --> 15:23.054
What about them?

15:23.056 --> 15:24.923
Well, if Peter
could try them,

15:24.925 --> 15:26.424
they might help
with his problem.

15:26.426 --> 15:27.859
Those are for man troubles?

15:27.861 --> 15:30.194
I've been prescribing them
as antidepressants.

15:30.196 --> 15:35.033
Everything's just getting
harder and harder.

15:38.637 --> 15:40.038
Hey, you guys
want another round?

15:40.040 --> 15:41.873
Oh, I don't know, Peter,
it's getting kind of late.

15:41.875 --> 15:43.141
Yeah, I got
to get going.

15:43.143 --> 15:45.209
It takes me three hours
to get ready for bed.

15:45.211 --> 15:46.945
Oh, please don't
make me go home

15:46.947 --> 15:47.979
and disappoint
my wife yet again!

15:47.981 --> 15:49.380
What are you
talking about, Peter?

15:49.382 --> 15:51.816
You know how earlier tonight
we all said we had erections?

15:51.818 --> 15:52.817
I lied.

15:52.819 --> 15:54.085
So did I.

15:54.087 --> 15:56.154
Dr. Hartman says I'm impotent.

15:56.156 --> 15:57.922
Oh, you don't have to
take that from him.

15:57.924 --> 15:59.958
You know, Dr. Hartman
once told me I had gonorrhea.

15:59.960 --> 16:02.093
So I hit him
in the head with a bat.

16:02.095 --> 16:05.263
I <i>give</i> gonorrhea,
I don't <i>get</i> gonorrhea. Okay?

16:05.265 --> 16:06.898
It's terrible, guys.

16:06.900 --> 16:08.900
I tried the pills he gave me,
but even they didn't work.

16:08.902 --> 16:10.134
Well, look at it
this way, Peter:

16:10.136 --> 16:11.469
without sex, you'll
have more time

16:11.471 --> 16:13.471
to do the things you've
always wanted to do.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.573
For me, it was learning
to play the trombone.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.642
Why the hell would you
want to play the trombone?

16:17.644 --> 16:19.510
For moments
like this.

16:19.512 --> 16:21.012
Peter can't
get an erection.

16:21.014 --> 16:23.815
(plays descending note)

16:23.817 --> 16:26.584
Peter, I am gonna help
you beat impotence.

16:26.586 --> 16:27.986
We can do
this together.

16:27.988 --> 16:29.687
Thanks, Quagmire,
'cause this sucks.

16:29.689 --> 16:30.788
I think even the people

16:30.790 --> 16:32.924
at the office supply store
can tell.

16:32.926 --> 16:34.659
Um, excuse me,
where do you keep

16:34.661 --> 16:35.994
your three-ring binders?

16:35.996 --> 16:36.995
Those are on aisle...

16:36.997 --> 16:38.696
Hold on a sec.

16:41.100 --> 16:43.601
We're all out
of binders.

16:45.537 --> 16:47.538
All right, Peter, now, when
it comes to curing impotence,

16:47.540 --> 16:49.107
sometimes you
have to get creative.

16:49.109 --> 16:51.609
So, we're gonna try
the Boston Method.
What's that?

16:51.611 --> 16:54.178
Well, basically, some dirtbag
from Boston yells at your junk

16:54.180 --> 16:56.014
to scare it
into working again.

16:56.815 --> 16:58.616
So you got a
stupid penis, huh?

16:58.618 --> 17:00.318
I-I guess so.

17:00.320 --> 17:03.187
You hear me in there,
dum-dum? Let's look alive.

17:03.189 --> 17:05.823
Listen, I could be nice about
this or I could get my brother.

17:05.825 --> 17:07.458
And he did some
serious time

17:07.460 --> 17:10.294
for throwing a turkey
off a bridge into a car.

17:10.296 --> 17:11.896
It's-it's not working.

17:11.898 --> 17:13.231
All right,
well, I got to go.

17:13.233 --> 17:16.901
There's a ripped screen door
that needs slamming.

17:16.903 --> 17:19.037
How could a town
with so many great colleges

17:19.039 --> 17:21.272
produce nothing but dopes?

17:26.745 --> 17:28.746
You sure this is
gonna work, Quagmire?

17:28.748 --> 17:29.914
Of course. This isn't
the first time

17:29.916 --> 17:31.315
I've rigged up
a sex puppet.

17:31.317 --> 17:33.751
I now have full control
over your genitals.

17:33.753 --> 17:34.552
Are you sure?

17:34.554 --> 17:35.920
Yeah, check it out.

17:35.922 --> 17:37.655
(giggles)

17:37.657 --> 17:39.991
It looks like
an unmanned fire hose.

17:39.993 --> 17:40.925
Stop smiling,
this is serious.

17:40.927 --> 17:42.560
You got to have
your sex face.

17:42.562 --> 17:46.497
Okay, okay, my sex face
is a ton of underbite.

17:46.499 --> 17:47.665
Okay.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.400
Lois, I'm ready.

17:52.371 --> 17:54.172
LOIS:
Oh, Peter.

17:56.875 --> 17:58.176
PETER:
How about this?

17:59.945 --> 18:02.113
Damn it, Peter,
I'll set the pace, you idiot.

18:02.115 --> 18:03.915
All right, now to
let some line out.

18:03.917 --> 18:05.249
Let her dance with it a little.

18:05.251 --> 18:06.951
(wires whistling)

18:08.587 --> 18:10.588
LOIS: Oh, come on, Peter,
get out of my water glass.

18:10.590 --> 18:11.956
I need to take a pill later.

18:11.958 --> 18:14.792
PETER: Oh, sorry, I guess I need
to be a little more to the left.

18:14.794 --> 18:16.961
A little more
to the left!

18:16.963 --> 18:19.297
Come on, Quagmire, you were
a Navy pilot for six years.

18:19.299 --> 18:20.631
Land this thing.

18:28.440 --> 18:31.042
LOIS:
Oh, Peter, that's new.

18:31.044 --> 18:32.877
Let me try.

18:32.879 --> 18:34.612
LOIS:
Eh, tired.

18:37.983 --> 18:39.717
Nothing seems to be
working, you guys.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.119
Is it gonna
be like this forever?

18:41.121 --> 18:42.320
Yes.
No.

18:42.322 --> 18:43.955
Yes.

18:43.957 --> 18:46.591
Hold on, Peter. You didn't start
having trouble in the bedroom

18:46.593 --> 18:47.992
until you lost
your job, right?

18:47.994 --> 18:48.926
Yeah, so?

18:48.928 --> 18:50.261
Well, that
explains it.

18:50.263 --> 18:51.896
I mean, you've been
completely emasculated

18:51.898 --> 18:53.464
because you're no longer
the breadwinner.

18:53.466 --> 18:54.799
What are you
getting at, Quagmire?

18:54.801 --> 18:55.967
There's only
one thing

18:55.969 --> 18:57.135
that's gonna restore
your masculinity.

18:57.137 --> 18:59.170
We got to get you
your old job back.

18:59.172 --> 19:01.639
It was a mistake for me
to ever take that promotion.

19:01.641 --> 19:02.940
Wait a minute.

19:02.942 --> 19:05.276
It was a mistake
<i>giving</i> you a promotion.

19:05.278 --> 19:07.111
(gasps) Quagmire.

19:07.113 --> 19:09.213
I'm not following you.

19:12.017 --> 19:13.851
So, by promoting
an incompetent man,

19:13.853 --> 19:14.952
<i>you</i> were at fault.

19:14.954 --> 19:16.921
Nice try,
but I'm not the one

19:16.923 --> 19:18.489
who drove a forklift
into a conference room

19:18.491 --> 19:20.124
and sent two people
to the hospital.

19:20.126 --> 19:22.293
Come on, since
this man lost his job,

19:22.295 --> 19:23.761
he can't pleasure
his wife.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.096
Is that true?

19:25.098 --> 19:28.299
I-I have what the kids call
"maje wien probs."

19:28.301 --> 19:30.301
Angela, I really
need my job back.

19:30.303 --> 19:33.037
And I could stand here
and give you a big speech

19:33.039 --> 19:36.040
about second chances and promise
to work harder than ever before.

19:36.042 --> 19:38.976
And I could remind you that
one day you might be in my shoes

19:38.978 --> 19:40.878
and maybe you'll need
a second chance.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.180
But I'm not gonna do that.

19:42.182 --> 19:44.148
I'm gonna cash in
this coupon you gave me

19:44.150 --> 19:45.349
last Valentine's Day.

19:45.351 --> 19:48.653
"One Redo For Being Fired
For Gross Negligence."

19:48.655 --> 19:50.755
"And One Hug."

19:52.491 --> 19:54.592
The hug one is expired, Griffin.

19:55.994 --> 19:58.029
This one's for free.

19:58.031 --> 20:00.064
Welcome back, Griffin.

20:00.066 --> 20:01.365
CROWD:
Aw.

20:01.367 --> 20:02.567
Who's that?

20:02.569 --> 20:05.903
Oh, I hired a studio audience
to do your old job.

20:05.905 --> 20:07.004
You guys are fired.

20:07.006 --> 20:09.207
CROWD:
Aw.

20:16.882 --> 20:18.516
Peter, I can't
help you shake DVDs

20:18.518 --> 20:19.850
out of the Redbox again.

20:19.852 --> 20:21.385
I got in trouble last time.

20:21.387 --> 20:22.987
Now, go away, I'm working.

20:22.989 --> 20:26.891
You don't have to anymore,
because I got my old job back.

20:26.893 --> 20:28.826
Peter, I'm so proud of you.

20:28.828 --> 20:29.760
And you know what?

20:29.762 --> 20:32.263
Something else is
working now, too.

20:32.265 --> 20:33.364
Oh, my.

20:33.366 --> 20:34.432
Let's go home.

20:34.434 --> 20:36.767
No. I am gonna
do you right here

20:36.769 --> 20:39.437
on a stack
of pita bread.

20:39.439 --> 20:41.072
LOIS:
Oh, Peter.

20:41.074 --> 20:44.342
PETER: Yeah, the bread's all
soft and doughy, isn't it?

20:44.344 --> 20:46.043
And the inside of
the bag's always wet

20:46.045 --> 20:48.412
because those hairy
dummies put it in too hot.

20:48.414 --> 20:51.849
(both grunting)

20:51.851 --> 20:53.951
This is a cool place.

20:53.953 --> 20:56.087
