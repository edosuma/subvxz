WEBVTT

00:06.242 --> 00:08.475
Yes. Yes!

00:08.477 --> 00:10.411
The Master has arisen!

00:10.413 --> 00:13.550
Long live the Shredder!

00:15.385 --> 00:17.918
I am... cold.

00:17.920 --> 00:21.421
Is this truly the earth?

00:21.423 --> 00:23.790
Or another illusion?

00:23.792 --> 00:26.993
I have been gone for eons.

00:26.995 --> 00:30.832
No. Many months,
but not eons, Shredder.

00:30.834 --> 00:35.335
You need to recover.
Kavaxas, will he heal?

00:35.337 --> 00:37.338
- In time.
- What?

00:37.340 --> 00:39.674
Restore him now!

00:39.676 --> 00:42.909
I do not want an excuse
to keep you here.

00:42.911 --> 00:45.048
Huh?

00:48.951 --> 00:53.287
Kavaxas stays with us, Tiger Claw.

00:56.759 --> 01:02.899
Soon this pitiful world will be ours.

01:10.640 --> 01:12.639
Ahh!

01:38.268 --> 01:41.067
Now we're talking.
Yeah!

01:41.069 --> 01:42.936
I've got an idea.

01:44.030 --> 01:46.292
Aww, sewer apples.

01:46.317 --> 01:48.419
Booyakasha!

02:07.963 --> 02:10.763
Such a strange alien dimension.

02:10.764 --> 02:13.699
I've never seen anything like it.

02:13.701 --> 02:15.362
Captain Ryan.

02:17.973 --> 02:21.042
The alien simply known as "Z"
has found us!

02:21.044 --> 02:23.511
What are we going to do...

02:27.550 --> 02:29.782
What do you want, "Z"?

02:29.784 --> 02:33.453
I want to destroy everything.

02:33.455 --> 02:36.850
Reality is boring
and meaningless to me.

02:37.092 --> 02:39.126
But what about love?

02:39.128 --> 02:41.796
Compassion?
Come, my friend.

02:41.798 --> 02:44.364
Let me introduce you
to our "Pleasure Ray"

02:44.366 --> 02:48.636
which will let you feel human emotion.

02:48.638 --> 02:50.637
I'm ready, Captain.

02:50.639 --> 02:53.649
To feel... emotion.

03:02.951 --> 03:06.654
But that was
a Photon Eradicator, Captain.

03:06.656 --> 03:10.891
You just violated
Confederation Rules...

03:12.627 --> 03:14.060
You're missing another classic

03:14.062 --> 03:16.631
"Space-Heroes:
The Next Generation," guys!

03:16.633 --> 03:18.865
We gotta get ready
for the recon mission.

03:18.867 --> 03:20.366
Like you should be doing.

03:20.368 --> 03:22.502
Ugh, I gotta collect more data
on Hot Head.

03:22.504 --> 03:24.405
Now that Tiger Claw
has all of the pieces

03:24.407 --> 03:27.340
that can resurrect Shredder,
we don't have much time.

03:27.342 --> 03:29.609
You realize Leo is gonna be stupid mad

03:29.611 --> 03:32.560
when he finds out you watched
"Space-Heroes" without him!

03:33.588 --> 03:35.416
Um, where is Leo anyway?

03:35.418 --> 03:38.118
Where else?
He's in the dojo, meditating.

03:38.120 --> 03:40.153
I feel so bad for him.

03:40.155 --> 03:43.107
The weight of the world is
always on his shoulders.

03:46.698 --> 03:48.104
I can't do this anymore.

03:48.129 --> 03:49.463
It's too much.

03:49.465 --> 03:53.733
I felt the same way many times
in life, my son.

03:53.735 --> 03:55.876
But we always endure.

03:55.901 --> 03:58.503
Father, why can't you appear
more often?

03:58.540 --> 03:59.958
Why do you have to leave?

04:00.143 --> 04:02.275
I have come to tell you, Leonardo,

04:02.277 --> 04:06.346
that you must be spiritually
prepared for what is to come.

04:06.716 --> 04:08.316
We're getting ready, Sensei.

04:08.318 --> 04:10.049
But it's not the Foot
I'm worried about.

04:10.051 --> 04:11.452
It's that dragon man.

04:11.454 --> 04:13.887
He's even more powerful
than the Super Shredder.

04:13.889 --> 04:16.255
Yes. And if he roams free,

04:16.257 --> 04:20.274
the earth will forever
be cast in shadow.

04:21.781 --> 04:25.231
My son. Remember what
I told you before.

04:25.233 --> 04:28.965
In darkness, look towards the light.

04:29.372 --> 04:31.204
What does that even mean?

04:31.206 --> 04:33.400
How can we stop him, Father?

04:37.446 --> 04:39.613
All right. I need to get
one last reading

04:39.615 --> 04:42.348
from Kavaxas to calibrate
my new invention.

04:43.052 --> 04:45.713
Team, it's time to go.

04:58.134 --> 05:00.200
So far, so good, guys.

05:00.202 --> 05:03.180
No creepy robed Foot dudes anywhere!

05:06.543 --> 05:08.401
Ahh!

05:10.446 --> 05:11.835
Hi-ya!

05:16.017 --> 05:18.685
They look like...
Shredder freaks.

05:21.911 --> 05:23.576
There's too many.

05:25.645 --> 05:29.101
Back, you wretched,
stinking Shredder beasts!

05:29.944 --> 05:32.622
They have a weakness
after all. Fire.

05:32.701 --> 05:35.729
No. Bright light of any kind.

05:35.937 --> 05:38.471
All right, trout-mouth,
why did you help us?

05:38.473 --> 05:40.641
You got three seconds to
explain yourself.

05:40.643 --> 05:44.144
I'll give him two before
I open up a can of sardines.

05:44.146 --> 05:46.682
Take it easy.
He means well.

05:46.839 --> 05:48.025
For once.

05:48.050 --> 05:49.883
I don't think it's a trick.

05:49.952 --> 05:52.272
All right, Fishface.
Talk.

05:52.456 --> 05:55.589
You want to know the truth
of the Shredder mutants, yes?

05:55.591 --> 05:58.917
Well, prepare yourselves
for a wild tale.

05:59.520 --> 06:01.627
<i>Remember when Shredder fought Splinter?</i>

06:01.629 --> 06:04.598
<i>Some of Shredder's experimental
mutagen blood</i>

06:04.600 --> 06:06.033
<i>spilled in the sewers.</i>

06:06.035 --> 06:07.868
<i>Well, not long after,</i>

06:07.870 --> 06:11.605
<i>a man roaming the sewers
found the green glowing ooze.</i>

06:11.607 --> 06:15.087
<i>For some reason,
and I do not care to know why,</i>

06:15.112 --> 06:17.919
<i>he touched it
and transformed into the first</i>

06:17.944 --> 06:19.938
<i>of these horrible monsters.</i>

06:20.866 --> 06:23.149
<i>He captured more people
from the streets,</i>

06:23.151 --> 06:24.851
<i>transforming a small army.</i>

06:24.853 --> 06:29.690
<i>All possessing random thoughts,
memories of the Shredder.</i>

06:29.692 --> 06:33.026
<i>These clones built an
underground shrine to Shredder,</i>

06:33.028 --> 06:35.228
<i>and that is when Tiger Claw,</i>

06:35.230 --> 06:39.053
<i>hunting for you Turtles, found them.</i>

06:41.061 --> 06:43.402
He used their power
and their dedication

06:43.404 --> 06:45.296
to build a new Foot army.

06:45.574 --> 06:48.375
Man, that is the craziest
story I've ever heard.

06:48.377 --> 06:50.510
Even weirder than your stories, Mikey.

06:50.512 --> 06:54.131
I really did meet Megan Fox
on that rooftop, yo!

06:54.516 --> 06:57.804
Anyway, thanks, Xever.
For helping us.

06:57.829 --> 07:00.253
So, are you gonna help us
take Kavaxas down?

07:00.278 --> 07:01.253
Heck no.

07:02.124 --> 07:04.057
This is getting to be too much,

07:04.059 --> 07:05.591
even for a talking fish.

07:05.593 --> 07:08.195
Shredder is back, and he is all gross

07:08.197 --> 07:10.230
and undead and disgusting.
Ugh.

07:11.303 --> 07:13.271
They already brought Shredder back?

07:14.203 --> 07:15.820
Ah, yes.

07:16.004 --> 07:18.637
I want to go back to a
nice life of crime,

07:18.639 --> 07:21.240
stealing stuff, romancing the ladies,

07:21.242 --> 07:22.755
that kind of thing.

07:23.211 --> 07:25.201
Later, tartarugas.

07:26.415 --> 07:30.522
Eh, who needs that robo-guppy
anyway. Let's do this.

07:45.778 --> 07:48.233
They're here. They're close.

07:51.740 --> 07:55.328
Welcome, my enemies.

08:02.817 --> 08:05.919
How many millennia have I waited.

08:06.454 --> 08:09.456
I will send you to the Netherworld...

08:09.458 --> 08:11.992
to take my place.

08:11.994 --> 08:15.128
Now I shall have...

08:15.130 --> 08:17.315
my revenge!

08:17.632 --> 08:19.140
Shredder?

08:21.269 --> 08:24.805
Booyaka... ungh!
Ahh!

08:27.909 --> 08:28.908
Get him!

08:36.462 --> 08:37.731
Ah!

08:46.995 --> 08:49.095
Ahh!

08:49.097 --> 08:52.132
- Ahh!
- Goongala!

09:02.160 --> 09:03.731
Ahh!

09:05.772 --> 09:07.645
Huh? No!

09:07.670 --> 09:10.503
Yes! Thanks, Kitty Claw.

09:11.986 --> 09:12.720
Ahh!

09:14.923 --> 09:16.307
Mikey!

09:19.461 --> 09:24.198
Ah-ha! All right, Hot Head.
Attack Zombie Shredder!

09:26.302 --> 09:29.855
Cannot... disobey.

09:32.508 --> 09:34.656
It's just like a video game.

09:36.250 --> 09:37.491
Wah!

09:38.989 --> 09:41.859
Aww, yeah!
Level up!

09:41.876 --> 09:44.087
- Nice try, Turtle.
- Whoa!

09:44.112 --> 09:45.809
Heads up, T.C.

09:47.355 --> 09:48.979
Grr!

09:50.566 --> 09:53.926
You obey only me, your master.

09:55.487 --> 09:58.339
I got the readings I need.
Mikey, we need an exit.

09:58.341 --> 10:01.086
Booyakabunga!

10:02.600 --> 10:04.739
I hates when they do that.

10:05.639 --> 10:08.165
How easily you turned on us.

10:08.190 --> 10:10.122
What is your game?

10:10.147 --> 10:14.764
Only to serve the one who
holds the Seal, Master.

10:14.984 --> 10:17.517
Shredder, what will you have me do?

10:17.519 --> 10:20.390
Banish the Demodragon
back to the Netherworld?

10:20.415 --> 10:24.798
No. Kavaxas is a powerful ally.

10:25.259 --> 10:28.195
He will remain on Earth with us...

10:28.429 --> 10:32.613
- as my second in command.
- What?

10:37.440 --> 10:39.553
There. Finished.

10:39.942 --> 10:41.208
Based on this new data,

10:41.210 --> 10:43.310
my spectral blasters
will be good to go.

10:43.312 --> 10:44.945
These babies are specially designed

10:44.947 --> 10:47.535
to take down supernatural entities.

10:47.649 --> 10:49.382
Whoa.

10:49.384 --> 10:52.118
Oh, this is the coolest thing!
Whoa!

10:52.120 --> 10:52.971
Ahh!

10:54.123 --> 10:56.422
- Ahh!
- Heh.

10:56.447 --> 10:58.048
I'll just put this down right here.

10:59.134 --> 11:03.441
I've got five spectral blasters,
one for each of us, except Casey.

11:03.466 --> 11:06.340
What? That's racialist, yo!

11:06.450 --> 11:10.171
We just don't trust you with
anything that shoots anything.

11:10.196 --> 11:13.086
Especially lasers.
Sorry, Casey.

11:13.111 --> 11:14.600
Ah, weak!

11:24.018 --> 11:26.057
All right, let's move out.

11:29.391 --> 11:31.525
Leatherhead! Yes!

11:31.527 --> 11:33.709
I called for some back-up,
dudes.

11:33.810 --> 11:37.210
Karai, I thought I told you to
heal up, we'd take care of this.

11:37.298 --> 11:39.765
Like I was really going
to listen to your advice, Leo?

11:39.790 --> 11:40.991
Come on.

11:41.149 --> 11:43.737
Well, we got the tools,
we got the talent.

11:43.739 --> 11:45.637
Let's kick some undead Shredder butt,

11:45.639 --> 11:48.655
and take Hot Head down
once and for all.

11:51.472 --> 11:54.724
I question whether
Shredder is alive at all

11:54.749 --> 11:57.751
or simply the puppet of Kavaxas.

11:57.753 --> 12:00.152
I feel you, T.C.
What are you gonna do?

12:00.154 --> 12:01.834
Go on mutant strike?

12:01.859 --> 12:03.459
Tiger Claw.

12:03.618 --> 12:07.053
Now that Kavaxas
is my second in command,

12:07.095 --> 12:11.268
you will relinquish
the Seal of the Ancients to him.

12:11.430 --> 12:13.164
Right now.

12:15.282 --> 12:18.704
No, never.
It is too dangerous, Shredder.

12:18.706 --> 12:20.540
I will not allow it.

12:20.542 --> 12:26.146
If you will not obey me,
then you shall be destroyed.

12:35.624 --> 12:39.599
Yes! Finally! It is done.

12:39.893 --> 12:42.496
What? What is done?

12:42.498 --> 12:46.622
I had to achieve three deeds
to end this world.

12:46.647 --> 12:50.250
<i>First, destroy a great warrior: Tatsu.</i>

12:50.306 --> 12:54.641
<i>Next, resurrect
an evil warrior: Shredder.</i>

12:54.643 --> 12:59.102
And finally,
destroy the Seal that binds me.

12:59.732 --> 13:05.160
And now, I can unleash the
spirits of the Netherworld

13:05.186 --> 13:08.912
onto the earth and control both worlds.

13:09.285 --> 13:11.653
Master Shredder, we must stop him!

13:11.678 --> 13:14.546
Don't you understand, Tiger Claw?

13:14.595 --> 13:16.287
You were right.

13:16.484 --> 13:20.786
Kavaxas is my master now.

13:22.188 --> 13:23.647
Watch...

13:23.672 --> 13:27.178
as the world ends.

14:22.031 --> 14:23.404
You've gotta be kidding me.

14:23.429 --> 14:26.017
I don't play with dead things, yo.

14:30.358 --> 14:31.700
Tatsu!

14:32.408 --> 14:35.598
Oh, no, Ho Chan?

14:40.121 --> 14:42.596
Oh, boy. You're doomed!

14:42.621 --> 14:44.883
Mikey, Karai, and Leatherhead,
you're with me.

14:44.908 --> 14:46.328
We're going after Kavaxas.

14:46.353 --> 14:48.668
The rest of you take down these ghosts.

14:51.549 --> 14:54.690
I don't need it, Casey.
I got Leatherhead.

14:54.715 --> 14:57.302
Booyakasha!

14:59.337 --> 15:01.016
Totally metal.

15:03.800 --> 15:06.934
Fight, my undead minions.

15:06.959 --> 15:08.726
This is too freaky-deaky
for me, dog!

15:08.810 --> 15:10.610
Let us make like tree and run.

15:17.626 --> 15:18.410
Whoa!

15:22.623 --> 15:26.125
In a dimension of suffering,
in an age of pain,

15:26.127 --> 15:28.988
I ruled on a throne of bone.

15:31.200 --> 15:36.069
I, Kavaxas, swore one day
I would rule all dimensions.

15:36.094 --> 15:39.073
The time has come!

15:51.563 --> 15:53.342
They just keep coming.

15:53.746 --> 15:56.689
Oh! Giant hands!

15:59.583 --> 16:02.328
Pecs... getting... crushed.

16:02.353 --> 16:05.953
Why don't you pick on someone
your own size, Ho Chan?

16:05.978 --> 16:06.967
Huh?

16:09.338 --> 16:11.003
- Splinter!
- Sensei?

16:11.005 --> 16:13.305
- Father?
- Hamato Yoshi?

16:13.330 --> 16:16.601
Now this really ticks me off to no end.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.545
I will send you back to the Netherworld

16:18.547 --> 16:22.044
from where you came, demon!
Hi-ya!

16:22.956 --> 16:25.718
Whoa! Ahh!

16:27.402 --> 16:30.516
Now is the season of evil.

16:30.557 --> 16:33.608
Humanity's last cry.

16:36.290 --> 16:37.483
Never!

16:43.205 --> 16:45.804
Your power is waning, wizard.

16:51.479 --> 16:54.914
Eat hot plasma, Tatsu.

17:02.849 --> 17:04.500
It's endless.

17:04.525 --> 17:07.327
I hate dead things.

17:19.675 --> 17:20.373
Ha!

17:27.637 --> 17:31.163
No!
Leatherhead!

17:31.188 --> 17:32.443
Ahh!

17:34.789 --> 17:36.180
Huh?

17:36.724 --> 17:38.382
Ah-ha!

17:45.734 --> 17:46.962
Mmm.

17:52.940 --> 17:54.800
Yeah, boy!

18:11.131 --> 18:13.112
What are you doing?

18:17.667 --> 18:19.428
No!

18:26.463 --> 18:29.760
Impossible! The Seal cannot be fixed.

18:29.785 --> 18:33.047
How... how is it working?

18:33.080 --> 18:35.548
'Cause I'm super dope like that, fool!

18:35.550 --> 18:38.617
Okay, Hot Head, you're gonna
stop the ghost invasion

18:38.619 --> 18:40.419
and make everything normal again!

18:40.421 --> 18:43.557
Your new boss, Mikey, commands you.

18:43.582 --> 18:48.417
I must... obey!

19:11.741 --> 19:15.308
It is time to go back
to your abyss, Ho Chan!

19:15.322 --> 19:17.923
No! Please! Seriously!

19:17.925 --> 19:21.309
I don't wanna!

19:27.334 --> 19:31.059
In darkness, look towards the light.

19:33.475 --> 19:35.856
I get it now. Mikey!

19:35.881 --> 19:38.474
Force Kavaxas to open up a portal
back to the Netherworld!

19:38.499 --> 19:39.321
Hurry!

19:39.346 --> 19:43.481
You heard him, Hot Head!
Open up that portal, now!

19:44.417 --> 19:50.059
As... you... commmand, Master.

20:04.761 --> 20:08.296
We do not belong here, demon.

20:09.200 --> 20:12.677
No!

20:47.782 --> 20:50.152
Good-bye, my family.

20:50.218 --> 20:52.369
I love you all.

21:03.531 --> 21:05.639
So long, Master Splinter.

21:07.363 --> 21:08.519
We've got the Seal.

21:08.544 --> 21:11.483
We're gonna smash it into dust
and spread it over the ocean.

21:11.508 --> 21:14.090
That power will never be used again.

21:14.242 --> 21:19.087
Tiger Claw helped us.
He left, declaring a truce.

21:19.112 --> 21:21.079
Wow. Who would have thought?

21:21.104 --> 21:23.525
I guess miracles really can happen.

21:24.653 --> 21:27.251
Like that amazing sunset.

21:28.247 --> 21:31.332
I was pretty sure we'd never see
one of those again.

21:31.583 --> 21:34.734
Come on, team.
Let's go home.

21:34.767 --> 21:36.305
Hold on, Leo.

21:36.330 --> 21:38.870
I just want to
appreciate this moment...

21:39.067 --> 21:41.126
for a little while longer.
