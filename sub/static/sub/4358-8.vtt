00:03.060 --> 00:05.580
Would you want to grow up here? 
 I have to.

00:05.580 --> 00:06.980
I'm Alex Mack.

00:06.980 --> 00:11.260
I was just an average kid 
 until my first day of Junior High.

00:13.180 --> 00:17.140
One minute I'm walking home, 
 the next, there's a crash

00:17.140 --> 00:20.380
and I'm drench in some weird chemical.

00:21.620 --> 00:24.820
And since then... 
 nothing's been the same.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.073

00:38.020 --> 00:41.380
My best friend Ray 
 think it's cool.

00:41.380 --> 00:44.780
And my sister Annie 
 thinks I'm a science project.

00:45.260 --> 00:48.060
I can't let anyone else find out.

00:48.060 --> 00:50.340
Not even my parents.

00:51.420 --> 00:54.540
I know the Chemical Plant 
 wants to find me

00:54.540 --> 00:56.380
and turn me into some experiment.

00:56.380 --> 00:57.700
But you know something?

00:57.700 --> 01:01.460
I'm guess I'm not so average anymore.

01:01.460 --> 01:04.459
[Alex] That's what 
 I hate about Paradise Valley.

01:04.459 --> 01:08.340
We have one concert every 
 few years so it's sold out in minutes.

01:08.340 --> 01:10.540
Ray's even more upset than I am.

01:10.540 --> 01:13.260
Well, your mom probably 
 can't relate, Alex.

01:13.260 --> 01:16.100
She's from 
 the Woodstock Generation

01:16.100 --> 01:18.140
the"Summer of Love."

01:18.140 --> 01:21.820
Nicole, during the "Summer of Love" 
 I was 11 years old!

01:21.820 --> 01:24.620
Oh, sorry.

01:24.620 --> 01:27.540
Annie, would you load 
 the dishwater, please?

01:27.540 --> 01:30.500
No, Mom, 
 it's Alex's turn, remember?

01:30.500 --> 01:32.020
Oh, right.

01:32.020 --> 01:36.140
Mom, Nicole and I 
 really have to study.

01:36.140 --> 01:38.020
Sorry, kid.

01:38.020 --> 01:40.300
It's cool, Alex, I'll help.

01:40.300 --> 01:45.380
Oh, no, that's okay, Nicole. 
 Go on up, I can do it by myself.

01:45.380 --> 01:47.580
Really-- I'll be right up.

01:47.580 --> 01:49.180
You sure?

01:49.940 --> 01:53.740
At least be careful.

01:59.300 --> 02:01.100
[zapping]

02:22.100 --> 02:24.780
[saxophone playing]

02:28.260 --> 02:30.420
[car door closing]

02:30.420 --> 02:32.780
Please, please!

02:33.540 --> 02:35.140
[sighing]

02:42.580 --> 02:45.300
- [knocking] 
 - Come in!

02:48.140 --> 02:50.420
Ray, I'm sorry. 
 I did all I could.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.500
Tickets are impossible to get.

02:52.500 --> 02:54.700
Maybe you could 
 see them next time.

02:54.700 --> 02:58.780
Is there anything else 
 you want me to do for you?

02:58.780 --> 03:01.420
Do you want to be left alone?

03:15.700 --> 03:19.540
[radio announcer] Fresh sounds 
 from The Bad Boys of Brooklyn.

03:19.540 --> 03:23.660
Now, it's time for the station 
 Z-Rock to give away

03:23.660 --> 03:27.500
two free tickets to the upcoming 
 All-4-One show!

03:27.500 --> 03:31.020
Get ready to grab your phone 
 and call 555-5785!

03:31.260 --> 03:34.020
- Come on, Alex, let's call. 
 - We'll never win.

03:34.020 --> 03:36.300
You should like Robyn, 
 at least try.

03:36.300 --> 03:39.460
...Paradise Valley Auditorium, 
 All-4-One, Call...

03:39.460 --> 03:41.820
Okay, we can do this, 
 we can do this.

03:41.820 --> 03:44.460
Now, come on, just... 
 just call, just call.

03:44.460 --> 03:48.700
[Mr Mack] I disagree, Stan, 
 uncontrolled DNA supercoiling...

03:48.700 --> 03:50.540
My dad's on the phone.

03:50.540 --> 03:52.660
Ask him to get off, 
 this is important.

03:52.660 --> 03:57.340
Okay... Dad, sorry to interrupt 
 but I really need the phone.

03:57.340 --> 04:00.820
- I'll be off in a minute. 
 - Okay, let me know.

04:01.300 --> 04:03.660
He says he'll be off in a minute.

04:03.660 --> 04:06.260
Is he talking science with someone?

04:06.260 --> 04:08.540
He'll never get off.

04:09.620 --> 04:12.820
Ray Alvarado, 
 calling for the tickets.

04:12.820 --> 04:16.459
Good try, Ray, but 
 you're only our 85th caller.

04:16.459 --> 04:18.700
[laughing]: 
 Try again!

04:18.700 --> 04:20.459
The cell detects free radicals

04:20.459 --> 04:23.420
and turns antioxidants 
 on and off in response?

04:23.420 --> 04:24.860
Alex, listen to him.

04:24.860 --> 04:28.900
Does he sound like a man 
 ready to get off the phone?

04:31.980 --> 04:33.940
Be right back.

04:38.700 --> 04:41.820
I've got figures somewhere, 
 Stan, hold on.

04:41.820 --> 04:45.780
And don't forget the temperature 
 setting is 1,000 degrees...

04:45.780 --> 04:47.140
[zapping]

04:47.140 --> 04:49.980
Stan, I think 
 I've just lost power here.

04:49.980 --> 04:53.260
Uh, let me check it out. 
 I'll call you back.

04:57.260 --> 05:00.180
Ray Alvarado, 
 calling about the tickets?

05:00.180 --> 05:01.620
Caller 97, no good!

05:01.620 --> 05:04.580
- [phone ringing] 
 - It's ringing! It's ringing!

05:04.580 --> 05:06.820
It's ringing! 
 Okay, okay, okay!

05:06.820 --> 05:09.380
Ready to take 
 our 100th caller, Z-Rock!

05:09.380 --> 05:12.540
Hey, who's this? 
 Are you there?

05:12.540 --> 05:15.140
Um, this is Alexandra Mack!

05:15.140 --> 05:17.260
[girls squealing]

05:17.260 --> 05:20.300
- Yes! 
 - [excited jabbering]

05:20.300 --> 05:24.900
Alex, our first question: 
 can you name all seven continents?

05:24.900 --> 05:28.060
Uh, North America, 
 South America...

05:28.060 --> 05:30.340
Oh, uh, Asia, Africa...

05:30.340 --> 05:32.940
Asia, Africe, Europe, Europe!

05:32.940 --> 05:35.420
Two more.

05:35.420 --> 05:37.700
Um, um, uh, Australia?

05:37.700 --> 05:40.980
Australia? 
 And, uh... Antarctica?

05:40.980 --> 05:44.180
- And Antaractica? 
 - You are right!

05:44.180 --> 05:45.820
[screaming]

05:45.820 --> 05:50.180
Alex, can you tell me what year 
 was the Bill of Rights ratified?

05:50.180 --> 05:53.380
- [D.J. laughing] 
 - [whispering]: Is he kidding?

05:53.380 --> 05:56.300
1791, and it's still 
 being threatened today.

05:56.300 --> 05:58.340
- Okay, um, 1791. 
 - 1791 is right!

05:58.340 --> 06:02.260
- [screaming] 
 - One more and we're off to the concert!

06:02.260 --> 06:04.140
Now, for the tickets, Alex.

06:04.140 --> 06:07.460
Can you tell us what year 
 American women

06:07.460 --> 06:10.380
first won the right to vote?

06:10.380 --> 06:14.540
- Um, 18... 
 - No, wait-- 1920.

06:14.540 --> 06:17.900
1920, are you sure? 
 That doesn't seem like so long ago.

06:17.900 --> 06:21.020
Trust me, Alex, 
 I'm as ashamed about it as you are.

06:21.020 --> 06:23.140
- 1920, come on. 
 - 1920?

06:23.140 --> 06:27.140
- 1920 is correct, Alex! 
 - [screaming]

06:27.140 --> 06:30.540
You've won two tickets to the concert!

06:33.340 --> 06:34.340
Dad!

06:35.420 --> 06:38.020
You're off the hook!

06:38.020 --> 06:40.580
Who are you going 
 to bring to the show?

06:40.580 --> 06:45.860
- I'm going to bring my friend... 
 - R-A-Y, Ray!

06:45.860 --> 06:47.820
Nicole! 
 [screaming]

06:47.820 --> 06:50.060
Z-Rock, the place to rock and roll.

06:50.060 --> 06:52.260
[screaming] 
 Oh, my God!

06:52.260 --> 06:55.460
Oh, my God, we did it!

06:59.300 --> 07:01.420
[ringing]

07:01.420 --> 07:03.140
Ray, she was right with me.

07:03.140 --> 07:05.340
She helped me answer 
 the questions.

07:05.340 --> 07:08.620
But you know how much 
 I wanted to go to that concert.

07:08.620 --> 07:12.060
I know, but when the D.J. 
 asked who I was going to bring

07:12.060 --> 07:13.900
I had to say Nicole's name.

07:13.900 --> 07:17.140
She told me when the Bill 
 of Rights was ratified.

07:17.140 --> 07:21.180
- Would you have known that? 
 - I thought we were best friends.

07:21.180 --> 07:22.740
Well, of course we are.

07:22.740 --> 07:25.860
If my father had scored tickets 
 I'd have brought you.

07:25.860 --> 07:28.020
I know, and I'm really sorry.

07:28.020 --> 07:30.580
I already asked Nicole, 
 I can't take that back.

07:30.580 --> 07:33.220
Alex, why are you 
 treating me like this?

07:33.220 --> 07:35.940
- Ray. 
 - I mean, here I am

07:35.940 --> 07:40.060
the one person besides Annie 
 you can trust with your big secret

07:40.060 --> 07:41.980
and you're going with Nicole!

07:41.980 --> 07:45.220
What does that have 
 to do with anything?

07:45.220 --> 07:48.980
Alex, please reconsider.

07:48.980 --> 07:54.420
I can't, Ray. 
 Ooh, I just can't!

07:54.420 --> 07:56.140
Alex!

07:59.300 --> 08:01.660
Alex, this chemical is awesome.

08:01.660 --> 08:03.100
I can turn into liquid

08:03.100 --> 08:06.460
and you need to scrape 
 my clothes to see that?

08:07.420 --> 08:12.660
Ooh, there is more to science 
 than empirical evidence.

08:12.660 --> 08:16.100
- You know that. 
 - Annie, I came to you for help.

08:16.100 --> 08:20.180
Is this really as big of a crisis 
 as you're making it out to be?

08:20.180 --> 08:21.900
Yes, Ray is really upset.

08:21.900 --> 08:25.180
Nicole is one of your more 
 intelligent friends.

08:25.180 --> 08:28.100
Just tell her 
 how much it means to Ray.

08:28.100 --> 08:31.980
- Hmm, you think so? 
 - Alex, it's just a concert.

08:34.020 --> 08:35.270
Okay.

08:36.940 --> 08:40.659
[Boy] Of course I can sell 
 you the tickets, Ray.

08:40.659 --> 08:45.220
- How much? 
 - [mumbles]

08:45.620 --> 08:47.260
How about a C-note each?

08:47.260 --> 08:49.780
A hundred bucks? 
 What kind thief are you?

08:49.780 --> 08:53.700
A smart one, Ray, because 
 I know what the market will bear.

08:53.700 --> 08:56.380
If you don't buy them, 
 somebody else will.

08:56.380 --> 08:58.300
Hey, hey!

09:01.140 --> 09:03.260
This ain't New York, pal.

09:03.260 --> 09:07.940
Big shows, they don't come 
 to Paradise Valley often.

09:07.940 --> 09:10.100
The people are desperate.

09:10.100 --> 09:13.580
Where would I get 
 100 bucks from?

09:13.580 --> 09:18.140
Well, that's your problem, Ray. 
 Let me know.

09:18.900 --> 09:21.860
- Hey, Alex. 
 - Nicole, I got to talk to you.

09:21.860 --> 09:23.980
Have I got to tell you something.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.780
Ray will not leave me alone.

09:25.780 --> 09:29.380
He's even offering me money 
 to buy my ticket to the show.

09:29.380 --> 09:32.260
- He is? 
 - Yeah, can you believe him?

09:32.260 --> 09:34.540
I can't be bought and sold like that.

09:34.540 --> 09:37.620
We had that experience 
 we should go to the concert.

09:37.620 --> 09:38.820
Yeah, but Ray...

09:38.820 --> 09:43.380
I'm not crazy about the band 
 but it's the principle that's involved.

09:43.380 --> 09:46.860
I know they say 
 everybody has their price

09:46.860 --> 09:49.300
but I refuse to admit 
 that about myself.

09:49.300 --> 09:53.020
- I understand. 
 - Now, what did you want to tell me?

09:53.020 --> 09:55.060
Nothing-- no big deal.

09:55.060 --> 09:56.540
You're the best, Alex.

09:56.540 --> 09:58.500
We'll talk more about it at lunch

09:58.500 --> 10:02.700
but I'm so proud of the way 
 we came through under pressure.

10:05.340 --> 10:08.140
- Hi, Ray. 
 - Hey, I just talked to Jerry.

10:08.140 --> 10:10.660
He can get me tickets-- 
 for 100 bucks.

10:10.660 --> 10:13.700
Feel like morphing 
 into a bank for me?

10:15.580 --> 10:17.460
I'm sorry, Ray.

10:17.460 --> 10:19.660
[bell rings]

10:37.180 --> 10:39.180
250 bucks?

10:39.180 --> 10:43.140
"The Paradise Valley 
 Chemical Plant offers $250

10:43.140 --> 10:48.620
to anyone supplying information 
 regarding the truck accident."

10:48.620 --> 10:51.020
Ray! 
 I've been looking for you.

10:51.020 --> 10:52.020
Hey!

10:54.900 --> 10:58.020
I just wanted to apologize 
 for all this

10:58.020 --> 11:01.420
but I can't take the ticket 
 away from Nicole.

11:01.420 --> 11:02.980
It's just not right.

11:02.980 --> 11:05.300
- What's that? 
 - Nothing.

11:09.580 --> 11:11.740
Ray, what are you doing with this?

11:11.740 --> 11:15.340
- You're not considering this. 
 - I won't cause trouble, Alex.

11:15.340 --> 11:17.740
- Don't worry! 
 - Ray!

11:17.740 --> 11:22.780
If you took me I wouldn't 
 even have to think about it.

11:23.060 --> 11:24.310
What?

11:35.980 --> 11:38.420
Wow, okay.

11:40.580 --> 11:42.860
[knocking at door]

11:45.020 --> 11:46.020
Yes?

11:49.780 --> 11:52.900
- Alex isn't here, Ray. 
 - Piano lessons, remember?

11:52.900 --> 11:56.260
Oh, oh, yeah, I forgot.

11:58.380 --> 12:00.340
Can I help you?

12:00.340 --> 12:03.100
Just wanted to see 
 what you were doing.

12:03.100 --> 12:06.700
I'm working, Ray. 
 Something you should consider doing.

12:06.700 --> 12:09.940
- I work. I also have a life. 
 - [sighing]

12:09.940 --> 12:13.380
Why don't you just give 
 Alex a call later?

12:13.380 --> 12:15.900
I have to go upstairs for a minute.

12:15.900 --> 12:18.900
And when I get back, 
 will you please be gone?

12:18.900 --> 12:20.700
I have a lot of work to do.

12:20.700 --> 12:24.460
If I see her, I will tell her 
 you were looking for her.

12:24.460 --> 12:27.420
Okay. Bye.

12:35.580 --> 12:36.580
Yes!

12:38.500 --> 12:41.620
Before you tell me anything, 
 let me warn you.

12:41.620 --> 12:45.460
I've seen about 30 kids since 
 I posted that reward notice.

12:45.460 --> 12:47.140
And they all lied to me.

12:47.140 --> 12:50.980
Now, why should I believe 
 that you'll be any different?

12:56.260 --> 12:56.980
Huh...

12:59.340 --> 13:05.100
Not so fast. 
 Where's my reward money?

13:05.100 --> 13:08.500
Wait right here, Raymond.

13:17.180 --> 13:19.660
- Hello? 
 - Hey, Mr. Alvarado.

13:19.660 --> 13:20.980
Hi, Alex.

13:20.980 --> 13:23.180
Is Ray there? 
 I need to talk to him.

13:23.180 --> 13:26.300
- No, but he'll be back soon. 
 - Do you know where he went?

13:26.300 --> 13:30.180
Some contest or something. 
 He said he was going to the Plant.

13:30.180 --> 13:32.660
- The plant? 
 - Yeah.

13:32.660 --> 13:34.340
Thanks.

13:35.180 --> 13:38.540
From the hill I see 
 this guy covered with paint.

13:38.540 --> 13:41.060
Then he runs in the opposite direction.

13:41.060 --> 13:42.180
And the cap?

13:42.180 --> 13:45.980
Uh, it fell off his head 
 and I went to pick it up later.

13:45.980 --> 13:47.580
Why?

13:47.580 --> 13:49.660
It was a nice cap.

13:49.660 --> 13:53.380
This boy... 
 what else did he look like?

13:53.380 --> 13:56.820
Uh, he was kind of tall, 
 maybe a ninth grader.

13:56.820 --> 13:59.140
A little bit heavy... you know.

13:59.140 --> 14:02.140
Raymond, when we came 
 by your house afterwards

14:02.140 --> 14:04.820
how come you didn't 
 tell us any of this?

14:04.820 --> 14:06.860
I didn't want to get 
 anyone in trouble.

14:06.860 --> 14:07.610
Oh.

14:08.860 --> 14:11.300
[whispering]

14:14.700 --> 14:18.380
[whispering]

14:18.380 --> 14:19.900
Raymond.

14:19.900 --> 14:22.660
You said that the boy 
 was hit by the chemical

14:22.660 --> 14:24.940
and then ran, right? 
 Right.

14:24.940 --> 14:28.260
Could you put that cap on your head 
 and show us how he ran?

14:28.260 --> 14:31.540
Well, yeah, I guess so.

14:45.780 --> 14:50.140
[Dave echoing]: Hey, kid, why don't 
 you watch where you're going?!

14:50.140 --> 14:52.020
Hey, kid, get back here!

14:52.020 --> 14:54.700
Get back here! Get back here!

14:58.580 --> 15:00.780
That's fine, Raymond.

15:01.580 --> 15:05.340
[whispering]: Come here. 
 Could that possibly be him?

15:05.340 --> 15:07.500
[whispering]

15:07.500 --> 15:09.260
Raymond.

15:09.260 --> 15:12.260
Your information has 
 been extremely helpful.

15:12.260 --> 15:14.980
We've decided that 
 you earned the reward.

15:14.980 --> 15:16.740
Yeah? Cool!

15:16.740 --> 15:18.980
Come back Monday at about 4:00.

15:18.980 --> 15:20.700
You'll get your money then.

15:20.700 --> 15:23.900
I can't wait until Monday. 
 I need the money now.

15:23.900 --> 15:25.820
Really... and why might that be?

15:25.820 --> 15:27.980
To be honest, 
 I don't want the money.

15:27.980 --> 15:31.620
I just want to see the concert 
 at the Civic Center tomorrow.

15:31.620 --> 15:33.620
I need the money to get tickets.

15:33.620 --> 15:36.220
The All-4-One Concert? 
 Very cool!

15:36.220 --> 15:37.580
I'll be there.

15:37.580 --> 15:40.660
I waited 42 hours on line for tickets.

15:40.660 --> 15:45.060
Raymond, what if I was able 
 to obtain those tickets for you?

15:45.060 --> 15:46.780
Would you be interested?

15:46.780 --> 15:49.340
Definitely. 
 I don't want to give my money

15:49.340 --> 15:50.940
to that Slimy Jerry guy.

15:50.940 --> 15:54.380
I'll have two tickets here 
 at the same time tomorrow.

15:54.380 --> 15:56.380
Now... the cap?

15:56.380 --> 16:01.100
You get the cap 
 when I get my tickets.

16:01.100 --> 16:04.780
Bring the cap with you 
 tomorrow, Raymond.

16:11.420 --> 16:13.860
Ray! I can't believe

16:13.860 --> 16:16.580
you actually came 
 to turn me in for money.

16:16.580 --> 16:19.500
I didn't turn you in. 
 I wouldn't do that.

16:19.500 --> 16:22.700
But I'm getting tickets 
 for the concert anyway.

16:22.700 --> 16:26.580
How are you getting tickets 
 if you didn't give me away?

16:26.580 --> 16:29.780
I just gave Vincent enough 
 to lead him astray.

16:29.780 --> 16:31.660
I wonder where I'll be sitting?

16:31.660 --> 16:33.260
Probably the first row

16:33.260 --> 16:36.500
and you'll be sitting 
 in the third row parmesan.

16:36.500 --> 16:37.820
That's "promenade."

16:37.820 --> 16:40.380
And the concert's 
 general admission anyway.

16:40.380 --> 16:42.180
Vincent has a lot of power.

16:42.180 --> 16:44.860
I have a feeling me 
 and whoever I bring

16:44.860 --> 16:48.180
will be sitting a lot closer 
 than you and Nicole.

16:48.180 --> 16:51.060
Wait. 
 What did you tell him, Raymond?

16:51.060 --> 16:53.020
I told you, nothing.

16:54.100 --> 16:59.060
I'm obviously a better friend 
 to you than you are to me.

17:04.900 --> 17:09.380
Alex... have you been 
 in the garage lately?

17:09.380 --> 17:11.099
No, why?

17:11.099 --> 17:14.140
Well, don't get upset, 
 but your cap?

17:14.140 --> 17:17.260
You know, the one 
 from the accident?

17:17.260 --> 17:19.660
- I can't find it. 
 - What?

17:19.660 --> 17:23.500
I was sure it was there. 
 I've been looking for it everywhere.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.700
I just... I can't find it.

17:47.980 --> 17:49.260
Hey, Alex.

17:49.260 --> 17:52.620
Nicole, I can't explain it now 
 but something's come up.

17:52.620 --> 17:55.580
I can't go to the concert 
 with you tonight.

17:55.580 --> 17:57.940
Go without me. 
 Take whoever you want.

17:57.940 --> 18:00.660
Alex, you were 
 looking forward to this.

18:00.660 --> 18:02.140
What's going on?

18:02.140 --> 18:04.820
It's Ray. I need to 
 talk to him right away.

18:04.820 --> 18:06.740
I passed him on my way here.

18:06.740 --> 18:10.860
He said he was going to 
 the Plant to pick up his tickets.

18:10.860 --> 18:13.140
What's he talking about?

18:13.460 --> 18:15.580
Uh, Al...

18:19.260 --> 18:22.180
Hey, this place is really 
 empty on Saturday.

18:22.180 --> 18:24.100
Well, we're here just for you.

18:24.100 --> 18:28.100
So, Dave, did Vincent get those 
 tickets like he promised me?

18:28.100 --> 18:31.820
Sure he did. 
 Vince is a man of his word.

18:32.700 --> 18:35.140
[laughing]

18:35.140 --> 18:37.820
This stuff is pretty cool.

18:43.860 --> 18:45.620
[humming]

18:48.340 --> 18:51.220
- What's going on? 
 - Ho-ho, relax, Raymond.

18:51.220 --> 18:56.260
You know, your coming to us 
 was obviously the right thing to do.

18:56.260 --> 19:01.140
[laughing] 
 Hey, we're going to help you.

19:30.500 --> 19:33.180
[Vince] 
 You just lay right here and relax.

19:33.180 --> 19:35.780
I'll be back in two minutes, Dave.

19:35.780 --> 19:38.540
Don't touch anything.

20:05.460 --> 20:07.580
[Alex] 
 Psst!

20:09.260 --> 20:13.820
- Say something? 
 - Can you get me some water?

20:13.820 --> 20:15.380
I guess so.

20:15.380 --> 20:17.300
You're not going anywhere.

20:17.300 --> 20:20.340
We've been looking for you 
 for a long time.

20:20.340 --> 20:22.580
Great to finally meet you.

20:24.340 --> 20:26.260
[buzz, click]

20:52.540 --> 20:53.860
[buzz, click]

20:53.860 --> 20:56.380
- Where's my cap? 
 - What cap?

20:56.380 --> 20:59.220
- The cap you gave them. 
 - Oh, Vince has it.

20:59.220 --> 21:00.740
We've got to get it back.

21:00.740 --> 21:03.140
No, we don't. 
 Ray!

21:03.140 --> 21:05.380
Alex, trust me, 
 come on, let's go.

21:05.380 --> 21:06.860
Oh...

21:07.500 --> 21:08.500
Yes!

21:09.380 --> 21:12.140
Ray, come on!

21:14.500 --> 21:16.100
This way!

21:19.700 --> 21:22.140
He's inside waiting to be tested.

21:22.140 --> 21:24.060
[buzz, click]

21:26.660 --> 21:29.580
But, Ray, my hat! 
 They'll trace it back to me!

21:29.580 --> 21:32.460
- You know, my hairs and stuff! 
 - No, they won't, come on.

21:32.460 --> 21:35.340
[knocking]

21:37.940 --> 21:40.540
I seem to have misplaced 
 my key card.

21:40.540 --> 21:43.780
- Is there a problem? 
 - Oh, yes, David...

21:43.780 --> 21:46.700
there is a problem.

21:48.700 --> 21:54.060
Huh... 
 Well, at least we have the cap.

21:54.060 --> 21:56.500
We can always pick up 
 the kid later.

21:56.500 --> 21:58.540
Oh...

21:58.540 --> 21:59.260
David.

22:03.260 --> 22:07.100
- So you didn't take it? 
 - No. I did, but I put it back.

22:07.100 --> 22:09.740
I just needed to see 
 what it looked like.

22:09.740 --> 22:12.940
I bought another one, 
 spray-painted it gold.

22:12.940 --> 22:14.940
I knew they needed evidence.

22:14.940 --> 22:16.260
Ah, here it is.

22:16.260 --> 22:21.020
I accidentally put it in a box 
 with the solar transformers.

22:21.020 --> 22:25.340
- You mean... 
 - The one they have is a total fake.

22:26.340 --> 22:28.460
[laughs]

22:33.060 --> 22:34.140
[sighing]

22:41.100 --> 22:44.180
Alex, how could you think 
 I'd ever give you up?

22:44.180 --> 22:45.700
I don't know.

22:45.700 --> 22:48.580
I knew how much you wanted 
 to go to the concert.

22:48.580 --> 22:50.620
Alex, you're my best friend.

22:50.620 --> 22:53.700
I would never get you 
 in trouble... on purpose.

22:53.700 --> 22:56.860
And look how perfectly 
 everything turned out.

23:03.020 --> 23:04.460
Do me a favor, Ray.

23:04.460 --> 23:06.860
If it's going to take this much trouble

23:06.860 --> 23:09.660
next time, let's just buy 
 the C.D. instead.

23:09.660 --> 23:11.340
Maybe you're right.

23:11.340 --> 23:13.580
