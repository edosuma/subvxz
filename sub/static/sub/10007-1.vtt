Wait a minute!

Jack Godell was my best friend.
These guys say he was a loony.

01:57:02.974 --> 01:57:08.938
He wasn't a loony.
He was the sanest man I ever knew.

01:57:09.106 --> 01:57:11.482
KIMBERLY:
He believed the plant was unsafe?

01:57:11.650 --> 01:57:13.275
Yeah.

01:57:13.443 --> 01:57:20.241
Yeah. Otherwise he wouldn't
have done it. He wasn't like that.

01:57:20.409 --> 01:57:25.287
I didn't know all the details.
He told me a few things.

01:57:25.497 --> 01:57:28.958
There will be an investigation
this time.

01:57:29.167 --> 01:57:33.462
Then people will know
Godell was a hero.

01:57:34.548 --> 01:57:36.716
Jack Godell was a hero.

Godell was his friend,

I met Jack Godell two days ago.

He wasn't a drunk or a crazy man.

01:58:24.473 --> 01:58:31.312
He was about to present evidence
to show this plant should be shut down.

01:58:33.899 --> 01:58:38.235
I'm sorry, I'm not very objective.
I hope it doesn't end here.
