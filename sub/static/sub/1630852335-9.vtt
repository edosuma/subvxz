The marshmello dematt.

09:59.899 --> 10:02.634
I've been a dog groomer for 20
years, already had made my own

10:02.702 --> 10:05.236
Paw balms and dog spritz
colognes, but I always thought

10:05.305 --> 10:08.039
To myself, "you know what would
be really awesome is if we could

10:08.107 --> 10:10.942
Detangle and dematt our dogs'
fur without using silicones."

10:12.211 --> 10:13.945
Now that would be something!

10:14.681 --> 10:17.181
It always stayed in the back of
my mind, and then eventually,

10:17.250 --> 10:19.150
I came across this list of
plants when I was online.

10:19.786 --> 10:22.454
And because of their slippery
nature, I immediately thought,

10:22.522 --> 10:25.557
"hey, that actually might work
in a detangling spray."

10:27.327 --> 10:28.326
And this is when everything
changed.

10:28.394 --> 10:29.628
[laughs]

10:30.463 --> 10:31.963
[faith] I tried out my very
first marshmello prototype

10:32.031 --> 10:33.999
In my own grooming salon,
and it worked!

10:35.368 --> 10:36.868
I've successfully brought the
marshmello dematt spray

10:36.936 --> 10:40.438
To market and added our new
award-winning, silicone-free

10:40.507 --> 10:41.506
Shampoo to the lineup.

10:42.909 --> 10:45.343
Marshmello sells through our own
e-commerce website; on amazon;

10:45.412 --> 10:47.712
And through our three
distributors in the u.S.,

10:47.780 --> 10:49.648
Three in canada,
and one in the u.K.,

10:49.716 --> 10:50.849
Using social media.

10:51.818 --> 10:53.418
It's the one that the dog
groomers use!

10:54.521 --> 10:56.287
And I think we might have some
guests that are

10:56.289 --> 10:57.222
Arriving shortly.

10:58.124 --> 10:59.791
-[dragons] aww!
-[michele] oh my goodness.

10:59.859 --> 11:00.959
Are those puppies?

11:01.027 --> 11:02.560
[arlene] we love puppies on this
show!

11:02.628 --> 11:03.895
-Yes!
-[arlene] we love them!

11:03.963 --> 11:06.097
Oh my goodness,
I know what happens now!

11:06.165 --> 11:08.166
-[manjit] beautiful.
-[wes] boys at home, oh yes.

11:08.234 --> 11:09.400
Oh yes.

11:09.469 --> 11:11.469
Wow!

11:11.471 --> 11:13.438
Oh oh, this guy is coming home
with me.

11:14.107 --> 11:16.307
Huxley needs a companion.

11:17.443 --> 11:20.445
-Manjit, where's your puppy?
-I'm allergic to dogs.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.180
-[wes] oh, okay.
-And horses and cats.

11:22.782 --> 11:24.983
-But I can admire [laughs].
-[wes] okay.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.218
[manjit] so what does the name
marshmello have to do

11:27.286 --> 11:28.052
With anything?

11:28.121 --> 11:29.287
Does it smell like marshmallows?

11:29.355 --> 11:30.355
[vincenzo] because they use
marshmallow, right?

11:30.423 --> 11:31.656
[faith] yeah, it does smell like
marshmallows,

11:31.658 --> 11:33.991
And we actually do use the
marshmallow root,

11:33.994 --> 11:35.326
Which is boiled and then
it's squeezed.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.962
The slippiness from the plants
comes from plant mucilage.

11:39.265 --> 11:42.533
[vincenzo] okay, faith, so
you've--you've buttered me up

11:42.536 --> 11:43.802
With the puppy.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.203
Now excite me with the numbers.

11:46.939 --> 11:51.309
So all-time sales are $450,000,
and that was since 2012.

11:53.046 --> 11:56.147
In 2015 is when I started
selling the detangling spray.

11:57.483 --> 11:58.750
How about the last 12 months?

11:59.352 --> 12:03.455
Last year, my gross sales was
just under $99,000.

12:03.523 --> 12:06.657
-Okay, so $100,000 in 2020?
-2020.

12:06.726 --> 12:07.959
Okay.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.460
So let's talk about the
top-selling product,

12:09.463 --> 12:10.562
Which is what?

12:11.197 --> 12:12.964
[faith] the lead product is our
detangling spray.

12:13.032 --> 12:14.599
Okay, and how much does that
cost you to produce?

12:14.667 --> 12:16.701
To produce, it costs me $3.50.

12:18.171 --> 12:20.838
And retail off my website is
$21.95.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.039
[manjit] okay.

12:22.108 --> 12:23.475
Decent margins.

12:24.644 --> 12:25.977
But on the $100,000 in sales,
how much did you take home

12:26.045 --> 12:27.245
After you paid yourself?

12:28.080 --> 12:30.915
For last year, I took home
$23,212.

12:32.786 --> 12:35.220
-That's before paying yourself?
-Yeah, that's right.

12:35.722 --> 12:36.888
-That's right.
-[faith] yeah.

12:36.956 --> 12:38.223
And then what did you pay
yourself?

12:38.958 --> 12:41.025
I just paid my mortgage,
basically.

12:41.027 --> 12:42.560
-Got it.
-Not much.

12:43.063 --> 12:46.864
And the plan this year going
forward is to continue

12:46.867 --> 12:49.600
To build out the
direct-to-consumer online,

12:49.669 --> 12:52.003
And that's where your investment
is going towards--

12:52.071 --> 12:54.873
But, faith, you've been at this
for nine years now, right?

12:56.009 --> 12:58.009
Like, you're making kind of
$20,000 for yourself,

12:58.077 --> 12:59.611
You're making $100,000 in sales.

13:00.379 --> 13:02.180
What's gonna change next year
from the last nine?

13:03.583 --> 13:08.920
So, I'm really happy to let you
know that I'm just about to sign

13:08.988 --> 13:11.022
A deal with a big e-tailer out
of the states.

13:11.090 --> 13:13.658
-Which one?
-Chewy.Com.

13:13.726 --> 13:15.893
-[michele] okay, yeah.
-Okay.

13:15.962 --> 13:18.162
And they actually approached me
in 2019.

13:18.231 --> 13:21.533
We have this big dog grooming
expo in the states,

13:21.601 --> 13:23.668
And I got a phone call out of
the blue after from one

13:23.736 --> 13:25.637

was down there...

13:25.705 --> 13:26.770

that you've been at this

13:45.324 --> 13:46.324
For nine years.

13:47.661 --> 13:49.260
The question is whether you can
capitalize on the opportunity

13:49.329 --> 13:52.263
That exists today because the
market is looking for products

13:52.332 --> 13:53.164

13:54.200 --> 13:55.132
Are you the entrepreneur that
can do that?

13:55.135 --> 13:56.234
That's the question I have.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.470
Well, that's why I'm wanting a
dragon, so that I can get

13:59.539 --> 14:01.673
A little bit of input on exactly
how to scale.

14:02.975 --> 14:05.276
[arlene] but $37,000 isn't gonna
let you be able to capitalize

14:05.344 --> 14:06.511
On what you have to do.

14:07.546 --> 14:10.414
You need significantly more
dollars to be able to grow

of the opportunity

14:12.686 --> 14:13.852

18:44.090 --> 18:46.257
Yes, so that is our bc flaxseed
heat pad.

18:46.325 --> 18:47.592
That is by far my favourite
product.

18:48.661 --> 18:50.794
[lux] so flaxseed is actually an
oil-based seed,

18:50.797 --> 18:53.297
And so it retains heat 30%
longer than any other grain.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.133
[arlene] this is a really good
idea.

18:56.202 --> 18:58.702
So we're actually the only heat
pad on the market shaped

18:58.705 --> 18:59.637
Like this.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.038
[arlene] yeah, like it's so
smart.

19:01.107 --> 19:02.840
-[lux] it's so simple.
-[dragons] yeah.

19:02.908 --> 19:04.808
But yeah, and so the reason that
we designed it is

19:04.877 --> 19:06.944
So that it can actually fit into
your pants,

19:07.012 --> 19:08.412
So we wear it like tucked
into our pants.

19:08.915 --> 19:10.414
-It's very like slim.
-[michele] that's very clever.

19:10.482 --> 19:12.983
You can also tuck it into your
hoodie if you need to wear it.

19:13.052 --> 19:14.818
Oh, that's a smart idea.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.253
And so what is your background?

19:16.322 --> 19:17.989
How'd you guys get into this?

19:18.925 --> 19:21.525
[domunique] so my background,
I was working in communications

19:21.594 --> 19:22.793
In--at the corporate level.

19:22.861 --> 19:25.196
And then I also before that was
working in non-profit

19:25.264 --> 19:27.131
And social innovation work.

19:27.133 --> 19:29.633
So I actually worked for--in
muscle recovery

19:29.702 --> 19:30.968
Prior to this and was like--

19:31.036 --> 19:33.037
So did you come up with the
formulations then?

19:33.105 --> 19:35.072
[lux] yes I did, based on that
experience.

19:35.140 --> 19:37.408
And then what science is behind
it?

19:38.878 --> 19:41.812
Okay, so, well, there's billions
of dollars poured

19:41.881 --> 19:43.480
Into sports recovery
every year...

19:43.483 --> 19:44.782
Mm hmm.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.250
...And almost nothing poured
into period pain,

19:46.318 --> 19:49.286
And so the science behind it is
that period cramps

19:49.355 --> 19:50.955
Are actually muscle cramps.

19:51.023 --> 19:51.989
Oh, okay.

19:52.058 --> 19:54.158
So when you get your period,
your body releases

19:54.226 --> 19:57.094
Prostaglandins which make your
uterus contract,

19:57.096 --> 20:00.097
So what's causing that pain
is--your uterus is

20:00.166 --> 20:02.533
A muscle--is literally
muscle cramps.

20:02.601 --> 20:05.436
And so we're treating it the
exact same way and then adding

20:05.504 --> 20:07.871
Additional ingredients that
people have been using

20:07.940 --> 20:10.208
For centuries to
treat period pain.

20:10.276 --> 20:11.542
Do you sell it as a kit?

20:11.610 --> 20:12.977
Are you selling it like--

20:13.045 --> 20:14.378
[lux] yeah, so we sell them as a
kit.

20:14.446 --> 20:15.312
[arlene] yeah.

20:15.381 --> 20:16.480
[lux] but we sell them all
individually.

20:16.548 --> 20:18.015
This is just sort of our like
starter pack.

20:19.452 --> 20:23.020
So that kit is $129 value when
you add all the products

20:23.088 --> 20:24.855
Together, and we sell it for
$109 as a combo.

20:25.924 --> 20:27.191
So have you sold any kits?

20:27.259 --> 20:29.460
-Sold any products?
-[chuckles] yes, we have.

20:30.530 --> 20:35.266

36:19.844 --> 36:22.412
We are the only ones in canada
salvaging rv's and recycling

36:22.480 --> 36:23.547
Used rv parts.

36:24.216 --> 36:26.716
But not only that,
we are the biggest and cheapest

36:26.784 --> 36:29.052
New rv parts store in all of
canada, period.

36:29.955 --> 36:31.454
-Cheaper than amazon, jagger?
-[jagger] cheaper than amazon.

36:31.522 --> 36:32.455
Cheaper than amazon.

36:32.523 --> 36:33.856
Cheaper than anywhere else.

36:33.925 --> 36:36.292
There's a massive gap in the rv
parts industry,

36:36.295 --> 36:38.361
And it's a cornered market by
big rv dealers,

36:38.430 --> 36:41.198
Charging markups of well over
150% on their new parts.

36:42.033 --> 36:44.500
-[both] it's insane.
-Let's put it into perspective.

36:44.503 --> 36:46.236
You go out and you buy yourself
a new trailer.

36:46.304 --> 36:48.171
So after one year, you go and
find yourself in your fridge

36:48.173 --> 36:50.373
Expecting a nice ice-cold beer.

36:50.442 --> 36:52.242
-Oh yeah.
-Only to find out it's warm.

36:52.244 --> 36:53.610
-[both] ugh!
-[manjit] oh!

36:53.678 --> 36:54.978
-[both] nobody likes warm beer.
-No, gross!

36:55.046 --> 36:56.112
-[wes] horrible!
-[jagger] so what do you do?

36:56.180 --> 36:57.380
You go to your local dealer.

36:57.448 --> 37:00.283
Your local dealer tells you it's
gonna be $3,000 for a new one.

37:00.351 --> 37:01.417
-Can you believe that?
-[wes] what?

37:01.420 --> 37:02.385
[michele] no!

37:02.454 --> 37:03.686
[dawson] that's where us young
farts come in,

37:03.755 --> 37:05.488
Cause at young farts rv parts,
the identical fridge, brand new,

37:05.556 --> 37:08.124
Is $2,300 for in-store pick up
or shipped to your door.

37:09.160 --> 37:11.794
We will be canada's number one
go-to rv supercentre,

37:11.797 --> 37:13.229
And we know it.

37:13.298 --> 37:15.865
So which one of you wants to
join us and become...

37:15.867 --> 37:17.200
-[both]...A young fart?
-I do, I do!

37:17.268 --> 37:18.635
[laughter]

37:19.637 --> 37:20.536
You're closer to an old fart
than a young fart.

37:20.539 --> 37:22.239
-I'm an old fart.
-[laughter]

37:23.574 --> 37:25.508
[manjit] so when somebody buys
the parts,

37:25.577 --> 37:26.776
If I bought a fridge,
for example...

37:26.844 --> 37:27.743
Yeah.

37:27.813 --> 37:29.112
[manjit]...Who do I find to
install it?

37:29.114 --> 37:31.814
Because usually you would go to
your rv store,

37:31.817 --> 37:33.016
Your mechanic, to do that.

37:33.084 --> 37:34.150
[jagger] so you could still go
to your rv store mechanic,

37:34.219 --> 37:35.819
But that rv store mechanic's
gonna be charging you

37:35.887 --> 37:37.220
The exact same amount of labour.

37:37.288 --> 37:38.488
[manjit] okay.

37:38.556 --> 37:39.555
[jagger] but a lot of campers,
we've really come to realize,

37:39.624 --> 37:40.824
Most of them are
do-it-yourselfers,

37:40.892 --> 37:41.791
You know what I mean?

37:41.859 --> 37:42.892
[dawson] they're pretty hands-on
too.

37:42.961 --> 37:44.827
And then we also have the used
option which is $1,400,

37:44.830 --> 37:46.596
So it just gives that incentive
for them to go,

37:46.665 --> 37:48.365
"okay, I'm picking
this up cheap.

37:48.433 --> 37:50.366
Even if I wanna take it to the
repair shop,

37:50.435 --> 37:52.568
I'm now saving a lot
of money," right?

37:52.637 --> 37:53.836
[jagger] yeah.

37:53.905 --> 37:58.441
50% of this rv can work on any
trailer from the 1960s to 2021.

37:58.509 --> 37:59.609
-[manjit] oh.
-[wes] hmm.

37:59.677 --> 38:00.843
So that's--

38:00.912 --> 38:02.312
[vincenzo] what percentage of a
given trailer do you think

38:02.380 --> 38:04.681
You can recycle or that you
actually do recycle?

38:05.616 --> 38:07.550
We recycle about 90% of the
trailer.

38:07.618 --> 38:08.785
The only thing--

38:08.787 --> 38:11.020
[vincenzo] so you recycle,
for example, that furniture?

38:11.089 --> 38:12.588
The open-up bed and everything?

38:12.657 --> 38:13.589
[jagger] furniture, fridge,
cabinets, door, ac.

38:13.592 --> 38:15.525
We got converter, furnace.

38:15.593 --> 38:17.327
[dawson] we basically strip it
right down,

38:17.395 --> 38:19.195
And then we even sell the frame.

38:19.264 --> 38:20.830
And so do you pay for them or
are they donating them?

38:21.566 --> 38:23.299
So the nice part is instead of
you paying a thousand dollars

38:23.368 --> 38:24.801
To get rid of 'em,
or trying to figure out--

38:24.869 --> 38:26.002
[manjit] right.

38:26.004 --> 38:28.271
Our average cost on a trailer is
around $1,000.

38:28.273 --> 38:29.806
Oh, it's nothing.

38:29.874 --> 38:31.774
[jagger] and the thing about
these trailers is that fridge in

38:31.843 --> 38:34.577
There, as soon as you sell it,
you're selling it for $1,400.

38:34.579 --> 38:36.279
Trailer is paid for.

38:36.281 --> 38:38.748
That means every other piece on
that trailer is completely

38:38.817 --> 38:39.849
100% profit.

38:39.917 --> 38:41.451
[michele] good.

38:41.519 --> 38:44.321
What percentage of people find
your parts by googling for them?

38:45.456 --> 38:47.423
[jagger] so here's--when we
first started, okay...

38:47.492 --> 38:48.658
[michele] yeah.

38:48.726 --> 38:50.893
...We put a really bad,
two-year-old coulda done it,

38:50.896 --> 38:52.628
Website going on just saying,
"used parts."

38:52.631 --> 38:53.763
[michele] okay.

38:53.832 --> 38:55.098
And because nobody else did it,
we ended up

38:55.100 --> 38:57.767
Number one in google,
and it absolutely took off.

38:57.835 --> 38:58.902
Wow.

38:58.970 --> 39:00.970
In the first month of being
open, everything we bought

39:01.039 --> 39:03.539
And acquired was gone.

39:03.608 --> 39:04.907
[arlene] walk us through the
numbers.

39:04.976 --> 39:07.110
Would you tell us your sales
from the beginning, please.

39:07.112 --> 39:09.612
[jagger] so from the beginning,
we did $260,000

39:09.680 --> 39:11.080
Our very first year in 2018.

39:11.149 --> 39:14.550
We did $280,000 our very first
year--or our second year.

39:14.619 --> 39:16.619
And last year, we did a million.

39:16.688 --> 39:18.221
This year, we're projecting
we're gonna do

39:18.223 --> 39:19.522
About $1.8 million by the
end of the year.

39:19.590 --> 39:21.024
[arlene] $1.8 million?

39:21.359 --> 39:26.329
So if you were to do ten times
the amount of revenue,

39:26.398 --> 39:28.398
Could that part of the supply
chain keep up?

39:29.668 --> 39:30.733
[jagger] it could.

39:30.802 --> 39:31.734
Ten times more revenue this
year, could you do it?

39:31.737 --> 39:33.202
This year, not without staff.

39:33.205 --> 39:34.504
[manjit] that's your only
hiccup?

39:34.572 --> 39:36.339
[jagger] yeah.

39:36.341 --> 39:37.974
[wes] so, what are you hoping to
achieve from us?

39:40.912 --> 39:41.778
We have hit a cap.

39:41.846 --> 39:43.479
We both--he dropped out of high
school.

39:43.548 --> 39:45.281
I barely made it through high
school.

39:45.283 --> 39:47.784
We've been doing a really
amazing job with what we know,

39:47.852 --> 39:49.619
And we're learning absolutely
every single day.

39:50.755 --> 39:53.356
This whole e-commerce world is
so--there's so much

39:53.424 --> 39:54.424
I'm learning.

39:54.426 --> 39:56.092
Like, we weren't initially in
here for--

39:56.161 --> 39:57.727
Full-heartedly the money.

39:57.795 --> 39:59.929
The money definitely goes with
the business,

39:59.997 --> 40:01.664
But we definitely, definitely
need some expertise.

40:02.634 --> 40:04.567
We know where we can grow this,
and we need a lot of help

40:04.635 --> 40:05.902
Doing it.

40:06.704 --> 40:09.105
[wes] listen, I left my parents'
house at 18 and finished

40:09.107 --> 40:12.842
High school and kinda educated
myself, but, you know,

40:12.910 --> 40:15.244
It's really the school of hard
knocks that create people

40:15.247 --> 40:16.079

40:16.948 --> 40:17.981

40:18.049 --> 40:21.484
And I wanna take you to the moon

40:21.552 --> 40:24.787
But you need somebody to kinda
formalize your back office,

40:24.856 --> 40:28.558
So I'm gonna do $150,000 for 15%

40:31.997 --> 40:33.830
[vincenzo] but you guys did come
in for e-commerce.

40:33.832 --> 40:35.498
-[jagger] yes.
-Yeah.

40:38.536 --> 40:40.270
[manjit] okay, I'll go next.

40:41.272 --> 40:43.706
I think that, like you guys
said, you've seen that there is

40:43.708 --> 40:47.276
A market for this, but also, you
need the supply chain help,

40:47.345 --> 40:48.644

can help.

40:48.713 --> 40:49.879
