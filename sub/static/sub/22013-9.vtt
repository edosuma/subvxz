00:42.276 --> 00:44.212
She compromised my therapist?

00:44.245 --> 00:45.846
Yeah, see, he was
messing with your meds

00:45.879 --> 00:47.215

It's all right, son.

03:18.932 --> 03:21.101
It's all right. Daddy's here.

03:21.134 --> 03:23.103
It's okay. Daddy's here.

03:23.136 --> 03:24.938
Daddy's here. I got you.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.215
Hello, Mr. Lyon.

03:37.718 --> 03:40.120
-Can he hear me?
-Your son is

03:40.153 --> 03:42.890
pretty much in his own world
right now, Mr. Lyon,

03:42.923 --> 03:44.992
but I believe
he can sense your presence.

03:47.127 --> 03:48.962
His blood pressure stabilized

03:48.996 --> 03:51.399
the moment his mother
came in yesterday.

03:51.432 --> 03:53.934
She didn't want to leave.

03:53.967 --> 03:56.103
What's up with the straps?

03:56.136 --> 03:58.706
It's for his own safety,
Mr. Lyon.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.240
We're keeping Andre
heavily sedated

04:00.274 --> 04:02.876
while we purge the psychotropics
from his system.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.245
And then what?

04:05.279 --> 04:07.481
We won't be able to determine
whether he's suffered

04:07.515 --> 04:11.785
any permanent brain injury until
the drugs clear his system.

04:13.854 --> 04:18.926
You do understand
your son had a psychotic break?

04:18.959 --> 04:23.864
And you understand that my son's
gonna be perfectly fine, right?

04:32.440 --> 04:34.975
Andre.

04:35.008 --> 04:37.911
I want you to listen to me.

04:37.945 --> 04:40.080
I'm your daddy,

04:40.113 --> 04:42.282

04:42.316 --> 04:45.419
Which means that the people
that did this to my boy

04:45.453 --> 04:48.121
is gonna pay dearly.

04:48.155 --> 04:51.825
Eye for eye, tooth for tooth,

in the kitchen somewhere.

05:13.581 --> 05:15.949
Oh, what are you doing, Lucious?

05:15.983 --> 05:17.951
What God gave me to do.

Oh, please, I got this.

-Shh.

05:21.088 --> 05:23.190
So, come on. What's the plan?

05:23.223 --> 05:27.795
I know we got the Captain's Ball
and all this stuff to do,

Dubois can I get at?

Uh, no, no, no.

05:32.866 --> 05:34.835

GAVIN: The Captain's Ball
begins promptly at 8:00,

05:51.184 --> 05:53.053
and we'll have
a veritable militia staged

05:53.086 --> 05:56.023
in the ballroom tonight guarding
the event from the inside.

05:56.056 --> 05:57.591
They're trained in discretion.

05:57.625 --> 05:59.393
Your guests will never know
they're there.

05:59.427 --> 06:02.329
So, you have vetted
all of the waitstaff,

06:02.362 --> 06:04.598
all of the hotel workers?

06:04.632 --> 06:07.835
Yes, ma'am. Nobody's getting
through the cracks.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.437
Very good. Thank you.

06:09.470 --> 06:11.071
-Thank you, gentlemen.
-Yes, ma'am.

Anika.

06:15.976 --> 06:18.378
I need you to check in
with the orchestra.

06:18.412 --> 06:20.848

a very specific program.

I want Ellington and BC,

06:22.950 --> 06:26.520

and my favorite, Schubert.

06:26.554 --> 06:27.521
Schubert.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.928
Oh, and please check
the placement of video screens.

06:34.962 --> 06:36.897
I want everybody to enjoy
the film we've created

06:36.930 --> 06:39.767

Philanthropic Foundation.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.502
-Consider it done.
-Thank you.

06:44.237 --> 06:47.240
Okay, Angelo. What is it?

06:47.274 --> 06:49.543
You sure you want
to go through with this?

06:49.577 --> 06:52.045
Have the Captain's Ball
when-when this war

06:52.079 --> 06:55.415
between our family and the Lyons
is-is so hot?

06:55.449 --> 06:57.551
(chuckles)
I'm not at war with anyone.

06:57.585 --> 07:01.154
But after last year's debacle,
it is time for us

07:01.188 --> 07:03.591
to differentiate
and distinguish ourselves

07:03.624 --> 07:06.393
so that people know who we are.

07:06.426 --> 07:09.630
You let one of those Lyons
show up here tonight,

07:09.663 --> 07:11.431

calling them something else.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.133
Please leave the office, Porsha.
Thank you.

10:36.569 --> 10:39.973
So are you ready to take
your seat back on your throne?

10:40.007 --> 10:41.775
You mean the seat
that I've sat in

10:41.809 --> 10:43.510
for damn near two decades
building this company?

10:46.646 --> 10:48.882
Damn right
I'm gonna sit in my seat.

10:48.916 --> 10:50.751
You should sit in yours.

10:53.821 --> 10:55.055
Your throne.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.028
(chuckles softly)

11:01.061 --> 11:02.629
Thank you.

11:02.662 --> 11:03.864
You're the queen.

11:03.897 --> 11:06.166
What's the plan?

11:06.199 --> 11:08.902
Well, we found out that they're
gonna have their little party

11:08.936 --> 11:11.571
at the Carlton Marquis, but...

11:11.604 --> 11:14.374
you know security's
gonna be up the wazoo.

11:14.407 --> 11:16.509
(playing minor-key
classical music)

11:16.543 --> 11:18.411
Yeah, I don't know how
we're supposed to get in there.

11:18.445 --> 11:19.679
Ma, you got a plan?

11:19.713 --> 11:21.514
-THIRSTY: You ready for me,
Cook? -Right on time.

11:21.548 --> 11:23.851
Oh, it's a family affair. Boys.

11:23.884 --> 11:25.719
-What's up, Thirsty?
-Lucious.

11:27.220 --> 11:29.422
Here's what we know.

11:29.456 --> 11:32.592
The security firm the Dubois
are using ain't no joke.

11:32.625 --> 11:34.828
They got security,
metal detectors,

11:34.862 --> 11:37.030
bag checks
in all four entrances.

11:37.064 --> 11:40.768
Well, can't we do what we did
in Vegas and, you know,

11:40.801 --> 11:43.436
go through catering,
get Becky on the inside?

11:43.470 --> 11:45.839
No, no, no, all service
employees have been vetted,

11:45.873 --> 11:47.440
even the freakin'
bathroom attendants.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.843
I'm telling you, this place is
locked tight, like a virgin.

11:49.877 --> 11:51.544
Me and Mal walk through
the front doors,

11:51.578 --> 11:52.846
people would notice us.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.948
Do we even know
who's performing?

11:54.982 --> 11:57.851
Yes, she has the ever-lovin'
New York Philharmonic

11:57.885 --> 12:00.220
up in there tonight--
with a guest conductor, though.

12:00.253 --> 12:02.055
I mean, it sounds bootleg to me.

12:02.089 --> 12:04.024
Uh, excuse me, Beethoven.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.059
Uh, you hear us
over here working?

12:06.093 --> 12:08.228
Well, I figured
if y'all wanted to hear from me,

12:08.261 --> 12:09.629
you'd rattle my cage.

12:09.662 --> 12:11.098
Well, if you have
any bright ideas,

12:11.131 --> 12:13.533
now is the time to speak up.

12:13.566 --> 12:18.038
Well, first and foremost,
we're Lyons.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.907
We don't do
the Chutes and Ladders,

12:19.940 --> 12:21.274
Mission: Impossible stuff.

12:21.308 --> 12:23.243
We want to break into a place,

12:23.276 --> 12:26.613
we do that by bustin' heads
straight up with music.

12:26.646 --> 12:29.482
It's music
that gets us in there.

12:32.820 --> 12:35.989
(playing ending arpeggio)

12:36.023 --> 12:38.758
THIRSTY: All right,
let me just get that paperwork.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.828
-(Becky sniffling)
-What's up there, Becky?

12:44.631 --> 12:46.599
Becky, are you, are you crying?

12:46.633 --> 12:48.401
No, I'm-I'm not crying.
I'm fine.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.170
You are crying, man.
What's going on?

12:50.203 --> 12:52.272
I'm not crying.
Leave me alone. I'm good.

12:52.305 --> 12:53.941
Something going on
with the hormones, mama?

12:53.974 --> 12:56.944
Would you...
Don't talk about my hormones!

12:58.711 --> 13:00.680
God.

13:00.713 --> 13:02.682
Okay, I see.

13:02.715 --> 13:04.684
Who's the lucky daddy?

13:07.154 --> 13:09.322
Here.

13:09.356 --> 13:11.324
Come on, take it.

13:11.358 --> 13:13.326
It's gonna be all right.

13:16.696 --> 13:18.665
-(elevator bell dings)
-JAMAL: Yo, Keem,

13:18.698 --> 13:21.501
I swear, I cannot figure
this damn thing out.

13:21.534 --> 13:23.336
It's either getting stuck,

13:23.370 --> 13:26.039
or it just splatters
every-damn-where.

13:26.073 --> 13:28.175
'Cause you never put
the top down tight enough.

13:31.478 --> 13:34.081
How the hell
did you get up in here?

13:35.916 --> 13:38.518
I gave your doorman
$10,000 in cash.

13:38.551 --> 13:41.821
It was... the money
my aunt gave me to leave town.

13:44.724 --> 13:47.194
(exhales)

13:47.227 --> 13:50.030
Wow.

13:50.063 --> 13:52.399
That's what you got
for what you did.

13:54.434 --> 13:58.371
It was supposed to be
a whole lot more...

13:58.405 --> 14:02.042
but I blew it,
because I fell in love with you.

14:02.075 --> 14:04.477
(chuckling):
Oh, well...

14:04.511 --> 14:08.415
let's... let's hear it
for the boy.

14:08.448 --> 14:10.383
What do you want?

14:12.452 --> 14:14.521
I'm not here for pity.

14:14.554 --> 14:16.223
I deserve everything,

14:16.256 --> 14:18.858
every-every broken nose,
every busted lip.

14:18.892 --> 14:21.128
-Yes, you do. -Yes,
everything that you gave me.

14:23.230 --> 14:24.831
But I got some information

14:24.864 --> 14:27.267
that I think you
and your family need to know.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.536
Yeah, well, you can save it.

14:29.569 --> 14:32.239
I'm not here
to give you absolution.

14:32.272 --> 14:35.042
Unless, of course,
you can tell me you didn't know

14:35.075 --> 14:37.310
what she was doing
to my brother Andre.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.115
You can't, can you?

14:44.217 --> 14:46.286
You knew every single thing
that she was doing,

14:46.319 --> 14:48.621
and you could've said something,
but you didn't.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.623
And for that,
my brother almost died.

14:50.657 --> 14:53.793
For that,
some of him already did die.

14:53.826 --> 14:56.930
So you can stand here with your
sad eyes and your busted face,

14:56.964 --> 15:00.600
telling me how much you love me;
I don't care.

15:00.633 --> 15:03.603
You and every bitch like you
deserves to die.

15:03.636 --> 15:05.572
Get the hell up out my house.

15:14.847 --> 15:16.783
Warren.

15:25.625 --> 15:28.095
What is it you need to tell me?

15:34.801 --> 15:36.769
* Yeah, nah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah *

15:36.803 --> 15:38.972
* Ah, ah, ah

15:39.006 --> 15:43.076
* Yeah, nah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah... *

15:43.110 --> 15:46.179
You've been real dismissive
with me lately.

15:46.213 --> 15:47.514
What are you talking about?

15:47.547 --> 15:48.982
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

15:49.016 --> 15:50.950
Got issues with my leg.

15:50.984 --> 15:53.620
-What about your leg?
-Well, I've got one leg.

15:53.653 --> 15:54.921
You think maybe
I'm not man enough

15:54.954 --> 15:56.589
because I don't have
both of my legs,

15:56.623 --> 15:58.591
but I thought you knew
I'm more than man enough.

15:58.625 --> 16:01.494
We are not about to have
a conversation about your leg.

16:01.528 --> 16:02.795
Let me come into that bedroom,

16:02.829 --> 16:04.497
I'll show you
ain't no Dwight in there.

16:04.531 --> 16:05.965
This is not about sex.

16:05.999 --> 16:07.434
Think it's not about sex?

16:07.467 --> 16:09.002
Everything's about
the sex principle.

16:09.036 --> 16:11.038
You think people
don't look at me and wonder

16:11.071 --> 16:13.773
whether I do it, whether
I don't, who do I do it with,

16:13.806 --> 16:17.044
does somebody want to touch my
nub, do I keep my leg on or not?

16:17.077 --> 16:19.512
Think I'm not the man
that I'm supposed to be?

16:19.546 --> 16:22.182
I'm Lucious Lyon.
I'm more than the average man,

16:22.215 --> 16:23.683
and somebody has made

16:23.716 --> 16:25.718
an outright attack
against my family.

16:25.752 --> 16:29.289
You think because I don't have
both of my legs as a whole,

16:29.322 --> 16:30.857
or all of my memory,

16:30.890 --> 16:32.892
that it's gonna stop me
from making them pay,

16:32.925 --> 16:36.829
-well, you out your damn mind,
because vengeance is mine. -No.

16:36.863 --> 16:40.567
It's mine. Diana Dubois
came after me and my family.

16:40.600 --> 16:43.636
And if you're here--
if you're really here--

16:43.670 --> 16:46.373
then welcome back, Lucious.

16:46.406 --> 16:49.976
Look, we got one shot
to put this bitch down for good.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.045
Just one.

16:52.079 --> 16:53.546
* Mm, mm, mm, mm

16:53.580 --> 16:56.549
* So I'm giving you up,
I'm giving you up... *

16:57.684 --> 17:00.019
ANGELO:
Say what?

17:00.053 --> 17:01.854
No, well, then, get...

17:01.888 --> 17:04.191
Listen to me,
get some more chairs.

17:04.224 --> 17:07.260
What... No, look, I'm not
telling the mayor he can't bring

17:07.294 --> 17:09.028
his mistress and her beard

17:09.062 --> 17:12.332
because we ain't got
enough chairs, so t...

17:12.365 --> 17:14.267
-Wait, Clive...
-Excuse me, sir.

17:14.301 --> 17:16.436
-You need to move over.
-Excuse me?!

17:18.971 --> 17:21.808
Clive has the evening off,
right, Cook?

17:24.477 --> 17:27.447
We got something
we need you to sign, bitch.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.655
(man speaks indistinctly)

17:44.764 --> 17:46.899
What do y'all want from me?

17:46.933 --> 17:48.535
Sign this.

17:48.568 --> 17:51.404
I told you,
I'm not signing that.

17:51.438 --> 17:53.740
You see, that wasn't even nice.

17:59.146 --> 18:01.814
I want you to sign
this confession

18:01.848 --> 18:03.816
stating that your nasty-ass mama

18:03.850 --> 18:07.420
kidnapped my granddaughter
and then extorted my son

18:07.454 --> 18:09.656
and made him work
against his own family.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.391
Sign it.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.960
I didn't know
anything about that.

18:13.993 --> 18:16.229
That happened before
I even knew what was going...

18:16.263 --> 18:18.298
Yeah, then maybe the judge
will go easy on you.

18:18.331 --> 18:19.766
You sign it.

18:20.933 --> 18:23.170
It's not gonna matter.

18:23.203 --> 18:25.172
If I sign it under duress,

18:25.205 --> 18:27.174
it's not gonna be
admissible in court.

18:27.207 --> 18:30.677
See, here he go,
trying to be mayor again.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.745
I got something for you.

18:32.779 --> 18:35.114
This is what we do
for people like you.

18:35.148 --> 18:37.116
See, we got a whole lot
in common.

18:37.150 --> 18:39.919
You're not the only person
with a controlling-ass mama

18:39.952 --> 18:43.290
who likes to prop them up
and then tear them down.

18:43.323 --> 18:46.393
We got a lot in common,
my friend.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.832
The only thing we got in common

18:52.865 --> 18:55.868
is that we bagged
the same bitch in bed.

18:57.170 --> 18:59.206
(Lucious shouting)

19:02.309 --> 19:05.044
-See, that was for Cookie.
-(coughs)

19:05.077 --> 19:07.113
See, I got a whole lot
of memories coming back to me,

19:07.146 --> 19:09.449
and unfortunately,
when it concerns you,

19:09.482 --> 19:11.618
they're all bad, and it makes me
want to shoot you

19:11.651 --> 19:13.553
in your damn head.

19:13.586 --> 19:17.357
Now, the way
I pieced it together,

19:17.390 --> 19:20.293
Cookie hurt you a whole lot more
than you hurt her,

19:20.327 --> 19:22.495
so I'm-a give you a choice.

19:22.529 --> 19:23.930
You can either sign this...

19:25.398 --> 19:28.000
...or your mama's brains
can be on it.

19:28.034 --> 19:29.569
(grunting)

19:36.776 --> 19:38.711
(Angelo coughs)

19:41.080 --> 19:43.049
That was a lot easier,
wasn't it?

19:43.082 --> 19:44.351
Come on, baby boy.

19:44.384 --> 19:45.685
To the ball we go.

19:45.718 --> 19:47.186
They're not gonna let you in.

19:47.220 --> 19:49.222
LUCIOUS: Yeah, they will. We're
gonna be your guests of honor.

19:49.256 --> 19:51.224
And if they don't,

19:51.258 --> 19:54.361
it's gonna be the bloodiest
damn ball they've ever had.

20:03.636 --> 20:06.105
-(crowd chattering)
-(classical music playing)

20:06.138 --> 20:07.940
WOMAN:
Thank you, Mrs. Dubois.

20:07.974 --> 20:09.942
-(Diana laughs)
-MAN: Wonderful to see you.

20:09.976 --> 20:11.177
DIANA:
Hello, gentlemen.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.612
Thank you so much
for being here.

20:12.645 --> 20:14.247
Thank you. Hello.

20:14.281 --> 20:16.182
Mr. Mayor, mm.

20:16.215 --> 20:19.452
Be sure to get on the dance
floor with your secretary.

20:19.486 --> 20:21.288
(chuckles)

20:21.321 --> 20:22.422
Hello. Hello.

20:22.455 --> 20:23.956
-MAN: Mrs. Dubois.
-Hello.

20:23.990 --> 20:26.192
-Arms up, please.
-(metal detector beeping)

20:26.225 --> 20:27.894
All right, sir.

20:27.927 --> 20:30.397
Right this way.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.098
Please empty your pockets.

20:32.131 --> 20:33.533
-(metal detector beeping)
-Right over here, ma'am.

20:33.566 --> 20:34.534
Thank you.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.369
GUARD:
Excuse me, sir.

20:36.403 --> 20:37.970
Did you remove all the metal
from your pockets?

20:38.004 --> 20:39.071
LUCIOUS:
No, I did not. My bad.

20:39.105 --> 20:42.208
(metal detector whines)

20:42.241 --> 20:45.244
I cannot let you in.
You're Lucious Lyon.

20:45.278 --> 20:46.979
-They're with me.
-(metal detector beeping)

20:47.013 --> 20:48.281
I was given
strict instructions, sir.

20:48.315 --> 20:50.249
-They're fine. I promise.
-Excuse me. Excuse me.

20:50.283 --> 20:51.951
You can speak to my mother.
Thank you, gentlemen.

20:51.984 --> 20:53.286
Next, please.

20:53.320 --> 20:54.654
So good to see you.

20:54.687 --> 20:56.456
Lovely, lovely.

20:56.489 --> 20:57.724
-Diana.
-Hello.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.058
-You look amazing.
-Thank you.

20:59.091 --> 21:00.092
-Yes.
-Captain's Ball.

21:00.126 --> 21:01.961
-Cheers to that.
-Shall we?

21:01.994 --> 21:03.963
-To the Captain's Ball.
-(Anika chuckles)

21:03.996 --> 21:05.398
Angelo.

21:05.432 --> 21:06.966
-Ang... Oh, my God, look at you.
-Mother, mother.

21:06.999 --> 21:08.635
Please, please, please,
please don't draw attention.

21:08.668 --> 21:10.337
(scoffs)
What happened to you?

21:10.370 --> 21:13.172
The Lyons happened to me,
and I apologize.

21:13.205 --> 21:14.774
They're here.

21:14.807 --> 21:17.577
-Angelo. -Excuse my appearance.
You look beautiful.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.312
(classical music continues)

21:23.683 --> 21:25.985
(tango music playing)

21:26.018 --> 21:28.955
-DIANA: What is that music?
-I'm sorry.

21:28.988 --> 21:30.890
*

21:42.369 --> 21:44.303
MAN:
Wow, is that Lucious Lyon?

21:46.906 --> 21:48.975
WOMAN:
Oh, they're exquisite.

21:49.008 --> 21:51.177
Oh, look at them.
They're beautiful.

21:51.210 --> 21:53.312
Such graceful movement.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.316
Okay, that's enough of it.

21:57.350 --> 21:58.518
-Get them out of here.
-All units...

21:58.551 --> 22:00.052
-Mother, it's no use.
-What?

22:00.086 --> 22:02.154
They came with a veritable
militia, all right?

22:02.188 --> 22:04.524
They snuck them in
with the musicians.

22:04.557 --> 22:06.493
*

22:26.278 --> 22:28.114
-(music ends)
-(crowd cheering)

22:34.687 --> 22:36.255
Chicken, drop the beat!

22:36.288 --> 22:38.190
Got you, Lucious.

22:38.224 --> 22:39.892
-(hip-hop music playing)
-The beat? Chicken?

22:39.926 --> 22:41.193
Not bad, old geezer.

22:41.227 --> 22:43.262
-I told you this gimp
still got it. -(laughs)

22:44.697 --> 22:46.232
HAKEEM:
Hey, yo!

22:46.265 --> 22:48.768
Yo, it's time to make this
Captain's Ball

22:48.801 --> 22:50.236
a little bit more baller.

22:50.269 --> 22:51.438
JAMAL: How 'bout
we give it up one time

22:51.471 --> 22:52.605
for Lucious and Cookie Lyon?

22:52.639 --> 22:53.606
That was incredible.

22:53.640 --> 22:54.674
So talented.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.075
-Yeah.
-(applause)

22:58.377 --> 23:01.848
Listen, I-I performed here
last year.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.784
Remember when it was the
People's Ball? For the people?

23:04.817 --> 23:06.553
Yeah, things have changed, huh?

23:06.586 --> 23:07.920
Yeah? No judgment.

23:07.954 --> 23:09.689
Maybe a little bit, right?
(chuckles)

23:09.722 --> 23:12.258
HAKEEM:
But this one right here is for

23:12.291 --> 23:14.894
our big brother Andre,
who couldn't be here today,

23:14.927 --> 23:16.763
'cause Diana Dubois
put him in the hospital.

23:16.796 --> 23:18.264
-(crowd murmuring)
-What? -What?

23:18.297 --> 23:20.032
Get them off the stage.
Get them...

23:20.066 --> 23:21.768
Come on, y'all. Why don't we
give it up for Diana Dubois?

23:21.801 --> 23:24.537
I see you, D.D.
I see you, D.D.

23:24.571 --> 23:26.539
(Cookie whooping)

23:26.573 --> 23:29.576
(orchestra playing
lively classical music)

23:29.609 --> 23:32.211
Y'all didn't think to check
the security of the orchestra.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.480
Yeah, I guess you didn't think

23:33.513 --> 23:36.348
the ghetto knew about
classical music.

23:41.988 --> 23:43.590
HAKEEM:
Whoo!

23:46.325 --> 23:48.327
* You told me it was love,
but it wasn't *

23:48.360 --> 23:49.929
-* But it wasn't *
-(hip-hop beat playing)

23:49.962 --> 23:52.064
* They say that bitches come
a dime a dozen *

23:52.098 --> 23:54.000
* You were cheap,
what the hell you do to me? *

23:54.033 --> 23:57.103
* Rip the heart up off my sleeve
and kick a field goal *

23:57.136 --> 23:59.005
-* It's supposed to be a party *
-* Be a party

23:59.038 --> 24:00.840
-* Why ain't I invited? *
-* I invited

24:00.873 --> 24:03.242
* I punch you in the face
and I don't care who like it *

24:03.275 --> 24:05.612
-* Funny how the time flies
-* Time flies

24:05.645 --> 24:07.346
-* It never last
-* It never last

24:07.379 --> 24:10.416
* Should've known that I could
never trust your ass *

24:10.449 --> 24:12.952
-* Because love
-* Love

24:12.985 --> 24:16.022
-* Is like a drug
-* Is like a drug

24:16.055 --> 24:18.991
* And you

24:19.025 --> 24:22.662
* Doin' too much
because you got me *

24:22.695 --> 24:24.597
* Trapped, trapped

24:24.631 --> 24:27.266
-* Trapped, trapped, trapped
-Hey!

24:27.299 --> 24:29.268
* And you doin' too much *

24:29.301 --> 24:30.803
-* Trapped, trapped
-* Yeah

24:30.837 --> 24:33.472
-* Trapped, trapped, trapped
-* Whoa

24:33.506 --> 24:35.107
-* You doin' too much *
-Yeah!

24:35.141 --> 24:36.643
* Stupid is, stupid does

24:36.676 --> 24:38.110
* Stupidness, look at us

24:38.144 --> 24:39.311
* Stupid bitch, look at us

24:39.345 --> 24:41.681
* Stupid bitch,
look at us *

24:41.714 --> 24:43.550
* Whoo, run up in the spot,
give me what you got *

24:43.583 --> 24:44.984
* We'll be in and out *

24:45.017 --> 24:46.853
-* Oh, baby, rockabye, hey
-(snare drum popping)

24:46.886 --> 24:48.955
Get... Call the police now.

24:48.988 --> 24:50.557
-* Now, why would you make me
an enemy? * - Enemy *

24:50.590 --> 24:52.692
-* Make me run up on
your family * -(snare popping)

24:52.725 --> 24:54.994
-* Funny how the time flies
-* Time flies

24:55.027 --> 24:56.829
-* It never last
-* It never last

24:56.863 --> 24:59.666
* Should've known that I could
never trust your ass *

24:59.699 --> 25:01.801
-* Because love
-* Love

25:01.834 --> 25:03.570
* Is like a drug

25:03.603 --> 25:05.672
I need everybody to
spread some love right now!

25:05.705 --> 25:08.040
* And you

25:08.074 --> 25:10.409
-And put your hands in the air.
-* Doin' too much *

25:10.442 --> 25:12.144
-One, two, three, go!
-* Because you got me

25:12.178 --> 25:13.980
* Trapped, trapped

25:14.013 --> 25:15.848
-* Baby

25:15.882 --> 25:17.917
* And you doin' too much *

25:17.950 --> 25:20.252
* Trapped, trapped, trapped

25:20.286 --> 25:22.589
-* Too much
-* Trapped, trapped -Yo!

25:22.622 --> 25:25.257
* Don't think about it,
think about it *

25:25.291 --> 25:26.726
* Doin' too much *

25:26.759 --> 25:28.060
* You got me lookin' stupid *

25:28.094 --> 25:30.096
* Baby, doin' too much *

25:30.129 --> 25:32.832
-* You got me lookin' foolish *

25:32.865 --> 25:35.167
-* So don't you make me do it *
-* Baby, doin' too much *

25:35.201 --> 25:38.004
* Don't make me pull the plug. *

25:38.037 --> 25:39.672
(music fades)

25:39.706 --> 25:41.941
(whooping) Yeah, that's right!

25:41.974 --> 25:44.844
Drop the mic, babies!
They're my sons!

25:44.877 --> 25:46.746
-Yeah! -Come on.
Let's get out of here.

25:46.779 --> 25:49.582
Let's just go.
Excuse us, please.

25:49.616 --> 25:51.083
LUCIOUS:
Where you going, Ms. Dubois?

25:51.117 --> 25:52.619
That's just the opening act.

25:52.652 --> 25:54.587
Y'all gonna miss the main event.

25:54.621 --> 25:57.123
Kill 'em, Cook.

25:57.156 --> 25:58.257
Mm-hmm.

25:58.290 --> 26:00.092
HAKEEM:
Yo, yo, yo!

26:00.126 --> 26:03.129
I need y'all to make some noise
for Cookie Lyon.

26:03.162 --> 26:04.897
(scattered clapping)

26:04.931 --> 26:07.099
-Yeah! -That's all right.
That's all right.

26:07.133 --> 26:09.468
Y'all won't clap now,
but you gonna clap later.

26:09.501 --> 26:13.105
Good evening, and welcome
to the Captain's Ball.

26:13.139 --> 26:16.609
Now, I've heard that you guys
are expected to stand around

26:16.643 --> 26:20.279
and listen to a bunch
of wordy testimonies

26:20.312 --> 26:23.783
about how amazing
Diana Dubois is.

26:23.816 --> 26:26.252
Well, I'm gonna switch things up
for you a little bit tonight,

26:26.285 --> 26:27.820
make things a little exciting.

26:27.854 --> 26:30.589
I'm gonna introduce you
to one of her nephews.

26:30.623 --> 26:31.758
What?

26:32.992 --> 26:35.762
Warren Hall.

26:35.795 --> 26:37.329
Take it away, Warren.

26:37.363 --> 26:38.798
Cue it.

26:38.831 --> 26:40.633
Okay, Warren. You're up.

26:40.667 --> 26:42.835
Hello, everybody.

26:42.869 --> 26:46.305
And I hope you're enjoying
the Captain's Ball.

26:46.338 --> 26:48.775
I'm sorry I couldn't
be there with you.

26:48.808 --> 26:50.609
-Gavin?
-Ms. Dubois.

26:50.643 --> 26:52.011
Where are the police?
Stop this immediately.

26:52.044 --> 26:53.512
We're trying, ma'am.

26:53.545 --> 26:55.447
They've got control
of all our systems.

26:55.481 --> 26:56.983
The police are on their way.

26:57.016 --> 26:58.851
WARREN:
But I want you to know

26:58.885 --> 27:01.487
who Diana Dubois really is.

27:01.520 --> 27:05.792
She used her family
to destroy another family.

27:05.825 --> 27:08.460
Starting with the kidnapping
of Bella Lyon.

27:08.494 --> 27:10.162
(crowd murmuring)

27:10.196 --> 27:11.831
She's one of
the most disgusting,

27:11.864 --> 27:13.666
vile people I have ever met.

27:13.700 --> 27:16.302
Warren, why are you doing this?
Do you need more money?

27:18.738 --> 27:21.440
-'Cause we got, we got...
-Angelo, Angelo, do not engage.

27:21.473 --> 27:24.877
I don't need your money, cousin.

27:24.911 --> 27:28.681
I'm trying to save my soul, and
I suggest you do the same thing.

27:28.715 --> 27:29.816
Okay.

27:29.849 --> 27:31.050
Where are you going?

27:31.083 --> 27:32.518
I'm going to find him

27:32.551 --> 27:36.255
and put him down
like the rabid dog that he is.

27:38.024 --> 27:41.327
(chuckles) There you have it,
ladies and gentlemen.

27:41.360 --> 27:44.864
Diana Dubois,
patron of the arts,

27:44.897 --> 27:47.700
a founder of numerous

27:47.734 --> 27:50.737
charitable organizations.

27:50.770 --> 27:53.973
You like to look at her
as the pillar of the community,

27:54.006 --> 27:57.543
and she ain't nothing
but a kidnapping, conniving ho.

27:57.576 --> 27:59.011
(crowd gasping, murmuring)

27:59.045 --> 28:01.013
You pernicious piece of trash.

28:01.047 --> 28:02.514
Ooh!

28:02.548 --> 28:03.750
These allegations
are as unfounded

28:03.783 --> 28:05.217
as they are outrageous.

28:05.251 --> 28:07.920
Oh, no, sister,
but we have proof!

28:07.954 --> 28:10.723
Because your bitch-ass son
that just ran out of this room

28:10.757 --> 28:12.358
signed a confession.

28:12.391 --> 28:14.560
Oh, and he's not alone.
He has company.

28:14.593 --> 28:16.262
Yeah, oh,
just look around, honey.

28:16.295 --> 28:18.430
You can't swing
a hair weave track

28:18.464 --> 28:20.099
without it brushing up
against one of those

28:20.132 --> 28:22.268
shady-ass Dubois family members.

28:22.301 --> 28:24.937
Lana! Girl, is that you?

28:24.971 --> 28:27.706
There is Warren's sister, Lana.
She's a doctor.

28:27.740 --> 28:30.109
Oh, and there's her friend,
Dr. Lambert.

28:30.142 --> 28:32.711
Well, let me tell y'all
about these two.

28:32.745 --> 28:36.615
Lana had her friend,
Dr. Lambert,

28:36.648 --> 28:40.853
prescribe my son
psychosis-inducing drugs.

28:40.887 --> 28:42.588
(crowd gasping, murmuring)

28:44.623 --> 28:49.695
My son suffers from
mental illness already.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.630
Who would do that?

28:54.566 --> 28:57.436
Diana Dubois,
the pillar of your community.

28:57.469 --> 28:58.437
(chuckles)

29:00.306 --> 29:01.941
She's a kidnapper.

29:01.974 --> 29:05.444
She kidnapped my grandbaby,
my son's daughter Bella.

29:05.477 --> 29:10.716
She also paid her own nephew
to infiltrate my family

29:10.749 --> 29:13.285
and rip son's heart
out of his chest.

29:13.319 --> 29:14.787
(crowd murmuring)

29:14.821 --> 29:16.188
What?

29:18.657 --> 29:20.927
These are my babies, okay?

29:20.960 --> 29:23.562
They're good boys.
They're talented.

29:23.595 --> 29:26.465
They might be messy sometimes,

29:26.498 --> 29:28.634
but they didn't deserve
to be treated like that

29:28.667 --> 29:31.337
-by this bitch.
-(crowd gasping)

29:31.370 --> 29:33.772
Good-bye, babies.
Y'all did a good job today.

29:33.806 --> 29:34.706
Thank you.

29:45.017 --> 29:46.853
Nanny, bring her bag, please.

29:46.886 --> 29:49.421
Hurry. Hurry.

29:49.455 --> 29:51.824
(door opens, closes)

29:51.858 --> 29:53.826
HAKEEM:
I'll take my daughter.

29:53.860 --> 29:55.794
The hell you will.

29:57.997 --> 30:00.066
I'm gonna need you to sign this.

30:03.702 --> 30:05.938
What is this?

30:05.972 --> 30:07.940
We got videotapes
of you and Diana,

30:07.974 --> 30:10.176
when Bella was supposed
to be missing.

30:10.209 --> 30:12.344
Warren told us where they were.

30:14.380 --> 30:17.683
You're an accessory
to a kidnapping.

30:21.020 --> 30:23.990
Hakeem, I...

30:24.023 --> 30:25.791
I can't go back to jail.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.927
Then sign it.

30:29.528 --> 30:32.531
-Give her to me.
-No, please. Please.

30:32.564 --> 30:35.301
(sobbing): Please, don't take
my baby again, please.

30:35.334 --> 30:37.169
Don't take her from me.

30:37.203 --> 30:39.205
Like you took her away from me?

30:39.238 --> 30:40.206
Huh?

30:40.239 --> 30:41.740
Please, don't.

30:41.773 --> 30:44.676
Stop crying, Anika.
It upsets Bella.

30:44.710 --> 30:48.847
Look, I know what it's like
to grow up without a mother.

30:48.881 --> 30:51.383
I would never do that
to my daughter.

30:51.417 --> 30:53.385
You're gonna be
a part of her life,

30:53.419 --> 30:54.987
but the BS stops right here.

30:55.021 --> 30:57.489
You will no longer
use her as a pawn

30:57.523 --> 31:01.093
to get to me or my family.

31:01.127 --> 31:03.062
Do you understand me?

31:03.095 --> 31:05.264
Yes.

31:05.297 --> 31:08.267
I understand.

31:08.300 --> 31:09.936
But the tapes...

31:09.969 --> 31:12.571
Nobody got to see them.

31:12.604 --> 31:14.706
But don't ever forget
we got them.

31:14.740 --> 31:17.409
And there's no statute
of limitation on kidnapping.

31:21.280 --> 31:23.615
Sign it.

31:28.487 --> 31:30.722
Oh, if I were you,

31:30.756 --> 31:33.926
I wouldn't go to
the Captain's Ball downstairs.

31:33.960 --> 31:35.561
It's a Red Wedding down there.

31:45.804 --> 31:47.706
Let's go, Bella.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.275
It's time to go home.

31:53.279 --> 31:55.181

32:06.592 --> 32:08.460
So there you have it,
ladies and gentlemen.

32:08.494 --> 32:11.430
-Let's go. Take me home.
-Didn't you hear them?

32:11.463 --> 32:13.132
They have a signed confession.

32:13.165 --> 32:14.266
Trying to save yourself?

32:14.300 --> 32:16.835
They have a coerced confession.

32:16.868 --> 32:18.904
You kidnapped a baby?

32:18.937 --> 32:20.006
Yeah, she did.

32:23.142 --> 32:26.645
Cookie, I am very sorry.

32:26.678 --> 32:29.348
And I hope to God
Andre makes a full recovery.

32:29.381 --> 32:30.849
Thank you.

32:30.882 --> 32:33.152
And I'm sorry I ever got
involved in any of this.

Shut up.

32:35.221 --> 32:37.756
COOKIE:
Diana Dubois. (chuckles)

32:37.789 --> 32:41.593

but a common criminal.

32:41.627 --> 32:43.462
(crowd murmuring)

32:44.796 --> 32:47.199
You...

32:47.233 --> 32:48.834
your gimp-legged husband

32:48.867 --> 32:52.171
and your intellectually
challenged children

32:52.204 --> 32:57.209
are not now nor will you ever be
fit to judge me.

32:57.243 --> 32:59.545
And as for the rest of you,
shaking your heads,

32:59.578 --> 33:02.481
batting your eyelashes,
trembling in your shoes

33:02.514 --> 33:04.616
and backing away...

33:04.650 --> 33:06.618
Pathetic.

33:06.652 --> 33:09.055
If it weren't for me,
half of you wouldn't be here.

33:09.088 --> 33:11.790
COOKIE:
I feel sorry for you, Diana.

33:11.823 --> 33:14.793
My family would never turn on me

the way yours have
on you tonight.

33:17.229 --> 33:19.065
-Really?
-Really.

33:19.098 --> 33:20.832
-Excuse me.
-DIANA: Is that why you spent

33:20.866 --> 33:22.534
the better part
of your life in prison?

33:22.568 --> 33:24.303
Oh, I wouldn't call it
the better part, honey.

33:24.336 --> 33:25.571
I'm just getting started.

33:25.604 --> 33:28.907
-Ms. Dubois.
-Yes, she's right over there.

33:28.940 --> 33:30.909
We have a warrant for
your arrest in the kidnapping

33:30.942 --> 33:32.878
-of Bella Lyon.

I wouldn't resist arrest, honey.

this band, honey?

Let's get this party started.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.475

-One second, Jamal.

34:04.976 --> 34:07.446

34:07.479 --> 34:09.515
Get back.

34:09.548 --> 34:11.049

34:11.083 --> 34:14.086
-Angelo...
-See? See?

34:14.120 --> 34:15.721
-Wait a minute. Listen.

-Angelo, this...
-Get your ass back.

34:30.902 --> 34:33.439
This is the part,
this is the part of the story

34:33.472 --> 34:36.208
where Romeo falls
into Juliet's arms, right?

34:36.242 --> 34:37.476
-Come on, man.
-And they get to have

34:37.509 --> 34:38.544
really hot makeup sex.

34:38.577 --> 34:40.912
-Angelo, all this...
-Listen. Nah, nope!

34:40.946 --> 34:42.781
Nope.

34:44.450 --> 34:45.817
Are we at that part
of the story?

34:48.320 --> 34:49.955
-Angelo, listen...
-This is how it ends.

34:49.988 --> 34:51.890

There's been a shooting.

36:05.531 --> 36:08.166
Yeah.

I think someone is dead.

LUCIOUS:
So, you headed home?

36:19.711 --> 36:21.012
COOKIE:
Yeah. Aren't you? I'm tired.

36:21.046 --> 36:23.249
I want to stop by the hospital
and let Andre know

36:23.282 --> 36:25.150
we took care of things for him.

36:25.183 --> 36:27.152
-Can you tell him I love him?
-Of course.

36:27.185 --> 36:28.654
Let him know
I'll be there tomorrow.

Um, yeah.

W-Why you say that?

This is me, baby. I'm back.

36:43.702 --> 36:45.070
You're back just like that?

36:45.103 --> 36:46.672
Well, not just like that.

36:46.705 --> 36:51.109
I'm still seeing the music
and hearing the colors, and...

36:51.142 --> 36:52.911
I'm kind of Lucious-plus now.

36:54.780 --> 36:57.949
I'm just hoping you and me
can get back to where we were.

37:00.652 --> 37:02.821
Back to where we were?
What do you mean?

37:06.992 --> 37:10.396
Either you're moving
into my bedroom, babe,

37:10.429 --> 37:12.331
or you're moving
out of the house.

37:14.400 --> 37:16.302
(chuckles)

37:18.404 --> 37:20.306
Well, I guess
I'll be moving out.

37:22.140 --> 37:24.976
'Cause if you're really back,
Lucious...

37:27.012 --> 37:30.816
...I really think we should
take our time this go-round.

37:34.853 --> 37:36.822
You know how much
I love you, right?

37:36.855 --> 37:38.524

getting to know you.

38:01.813 --> 38:02.981
Yeah. Me, too.

38:03.014 --> 38:04.249
I'm gonna send you a ticket,

-Who is this?

How old are you? 15?

38:16.662 --> 38:18.530
You know what?
She happens to be 32.

38:18.564 --> 38:21.166
-Whatever. -And she's an
accomplished assistant engineer.

38:21.199 --> 38:22.968
What do you want, Giselle?

38:23.001 --> 38:24.370
Want me to wash
your Maserati for you?

38:24.403 --> 38:26.271
Look, I want you to tell me

38:26.304 --> 38:28.540
that this business with Steve
Lawrence is just a bad dream.

38:28.574 --> 38:30.175
What are you talking about?

38:30.208 --> 38:32.043
Oh, my God.

it's real, Eddie.

38:52.263 --> 38:53.899
We're broke.

38:53.932 --> 38:55.534
Wiped out.

38:55.567 --> 38:57.202
You, me, the other ex-wife--

38:57.235 --> 38:59.304
that's if you had her in the
same investments you had me in--

38:59.337 --> 39:00.839
the kids from both marriages.

39:00.872 --> 39:02.641
I saw the returns.
I-I saw them myself.

39:02.674 --> 39:04.376
It was a Ponzi scheme.

39:04.410 --> 39:06.678
He was robbing Peter
to pay Paul.

39:09.347 --> 39:12.384
Okay, what are we gonna do? Huh?

39:15.687 --> 39:18.724
It's not a problem, Giselle.

39:18.757 --> 39:20.559
You see where we are, right?

39:20.592 --> 39:22.428
Empire. So?

39:22.461 --> 39:24.430
I've been ensconced here
for the last few months.

39:24.463 --> 39:26.732
I've been helping them
stay afloat.

39:26.765 --> 39:28.734
Cookie and Lucious would love

39:28.767 --> 39:31.002
for me to stick around Empire,
help them out.

39:31.036 --> 39:32.938
Hey.

39:32.971 --> 39:34.372

Can you hear me, cheap seats?

40:32.297 --> 40:34.199

40:36.034 --> 40:38.637
Took some doing to find out
where they had you hidden away.

40:40.472 --> 40:42.974
You been keeping
your mouth shut?

40:43.008 --> 40:44.976
I didn't think so, either.

40:48.680 --> 40:51.750
Hey, just checking on Andre.

40:51.783 --> 40:53.485
How you doing, Lucious?

40:53.519 --> 40:54.986
How'd you find him?

40:55.020 --> 40:57.789
(scoffs) You ain't
the only one with juice.

40:57.823 --> 40:59.758
Why you hiding him, anyway?

40:59.791 --> 41:01.359
I'm not hiding him.

41:01.392 --> 41:03.361
I'm protecting him.

41:03.394 --> 41:05.631
I didn't know
y'all became friends.

41:06.898 --> 41:09.367
Andre is my boy.

41:09.400 --> 41:12.638
We squashed all that petty stuff
a long time ago.

41:12.671 --> 41:15.140
Anyway, I'm gonna let you
have some time with your son.
