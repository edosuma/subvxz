01:20.705 --> 01:24.125
<i>Poor baby. I used to
be just like you.</i>

01:24.750 --> 01:27.420
<i>A child of the night, wild and free.</i>

01:35.469 --> 01:40.474
<i>I was the cat who walked by herself,
and the city was my hunting ground.</i>

01:41.142 --> 01:43.644
<i>I'd prowl through Gotham each evening,</i>

01:43.894 --> 01:47.815
<i>going where I liked
and taking whatever I wanted.</i>

02:05.666 --> 02:06.792
<i>Until I met him.</i>

02:33.027 --> 02:35.321
<i>I gave him my best fight,
but in the end,</i>

02:36.656 --> 02:38.407
<i>kitty got her claws clipped.</i>

02:46.332 --> 02:49.627
<i>Had to promise I'd be a good little pet
and walk on a leash.</i>

02:51.545 --> 02:53.047
<i>Even if it killed me.</i>

03:09.355 --> 03:11.691
Oh, you just say that
to all the beautiful girls.

03:13.984 --> 03:16.237
Selina? Excuse me.

03:18.864 --> 03:20.032
Senna?

03:25.329 --> 03:28.499
"Extinction." I can relate to that.

03:28.999 --> 03:30.459
You're in a cheery mood.

03:30.668 --> 03:33.212
Giving up Catwoman
hasn't been easy, Bruce.

03:33.421 --> 03:35.423
I miss the excitement, the danger.

03:36.215 --> 03:38.467
Sometimes I feel so tempted.

03:39.635 --> 03:41.137
Even though you'd be risking prison?

03:41.429 --> 03:43.180
Tell me I'm not in a cage now.

03:43.347 --> 03:44.557
Bruce Wayne.

03:44.932 --> 03:47.226
I wondered where
you'd been hiding yourself.

03:48.102 --> 03:50.688
And whom, may I ask,
is your attractive date?

03:50.980 --> 03:53.941
- Veronica Vreeland, meet Selina Kyle.
- We've met.

03:54.692 --> 03:58.446
- At the wildlife fundraiser last year?
- Oh, of course.

03:59.071 --> 04:01.907
- Love what you've done to your hair.
- Thanks.

04:02.616 --> 04:05.661
Since you're so devoted
to wildlife, Selina,

04:05.911 --> 04:09.248
I can't wait to hear what you think
of the museum's new conservation hall.

04:09.915 --> 04:13.043
I had it built in honor
of my grandfather, Stanton Vreeland.

04:13.377 --> 04:16.881
He was the first to realize the
importance of preserving rare animals.

04:17.506 --> 04:20.593
Not surprising, considering
how many of them he obliterated.

04:20.926 --> 04:22.094
Excuse me?

04:22.428 --> 04:24.472
Stanton Vreeland was a playboy sportsman

04:24.555 --> 04:27.349
who'd blow away anything
that wandered into his gunsight.

04:27.767 --> 04:30.644
He had to preserve animals
or he'd have nothing left to shoot.

04:31.187 --> 04:32.229
Is that right?

04:32.646 --> 04:33.647
Uh-huh!

04:33.939 --> 04:37.026
In fact, most of these critters are gone
thanks to trigger-happy jerks

04:37.109 --> 04:39.528
- like old Grandpa.
- Sefina.

04:39.987 --> 04:42.656
But, Bruce,
Miss Vreeland asked me what I thought.

04:43.115 --> 04:44.575
I think you've said enough.

04:45.201 --> 04:47.036
Yes, perhaps I have.

04:51.040 --> 04:54.752
Just once I'd like to throw a party
without some kook showing up.

04:54.960 --> 04:56.545
Uh. Excuse me.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.513
Well, that was pretty rude.

05:05.846 --> 05:07.389
Just the cat in me, I guess.

05:07.932 --> 05:11.977
Look, Bruce, it was sweet of you
to invite me, but I don't fit in here.

05:12.311 --> 05:14.772
Sometimes I feel like
I don't fit in anywhere.

05:25.324 --> 05:26.367
Taxi.

05:30.913 --> 05:33.707
- Your ride, Miss Kyle.
- Hey. What the-

05:40.464 --> 05:44.552
- Let me out, you big ape.
- She's a live one.

05:44.760 --> 05:47.263
In two seconds, that'll be more
than I can say about you.

05:47.555 --> 05:49.932
Calm down, pussycat.
We're all friends here.

05:50.349 --> 05:53.519
Dummy, don't keep
our pretty guest in the dark.

05:53.894 --> 05:55.563
Yes, sir, Mr. Scarface.

05:56.438 --> 05:57.481
Ah! That's better.

05:59.567 --> 06:00.609
You gotta be kidding.

06:02.528 --> 06:05.614
What's she laughing at?
My fly ain't open, is it?

06:06.073 --> 06:08.033
- No, sir.
- So, what's the gag?

06:08.576 --> 06:12.663
Come on. You know. "What's the gag?"

06:12.830 --> 06:14.039
Can it, sister.

06:14.331 --> 06:17.668
This is Scarface you're dealing with
and I don't stand for no disrespect.

06:17.918 --> 06:21.714
I'd do as he says, ma'am.
Mr. Scarface can be quite insistent.

06:21.797 --> 06:23.716
I don't think anyone's talking to you.

06:24.258 --> 06:26.635
- No, sir. No, sir.
- Right.

06:27.344 --> 06:28.721
So, what do you want with me?

06:29.179 --> 06:30.681
My boys happened to be in the museum

06:30.764 --> 06:33.267
when they saw your little set-to
with Miss Ronnie V.

06:33.976 --> 06:35.686
They also seen you licking your whiskers

06:35.769 --> 06:38.063
at the sight of Ronnie's
pretty sparklers.

06:38.856 --> 06:40.149
You're boring me, log.

06:42.192 --> 06:46.238
So, what if I could provide you with a
foolproof plan for snatching those rocks

06:46.322 --> 06:48.699
with no risk of you getting caught?

06:50.951 --> 06:53.203
Pass. Kitty's been staying in at night.

06:53.787 --> 06:56.874
It's not the greatest, but it beats
the pound, if you know what I mean.

06:57.041 --> 06:58.667
Now that's a darn shame.

06:58.834 --> 07:02.171
And I thought for sure you'd want
a chance to get even with the Vreelands.

07:02.755 --> 07:04.506
Not just for yourself, you understand,

07:04.590 --> 07:07.343
but for all those
poor little stuffed critters

07:07.509 --> 07:10.804
what never had the chance to fight back.

07:11.764 --> 07:13.015
Oh! Barf.

07:13.098 --> 07:14.516
It's a 50-50 cut.

07:14.725 --> 07:16.727
Take it or leave it. You in, or what?

07:37.414 --> 07:38.791
You know what, Isis?

07:40.668 --> 07:42.711
Extinction's for wimps.

07:56.100 --> 07:58.519
Mastodon, check.

07:58.936 --> 08:01.063
Cave bear, check.

08:01.480 --> 08:02.523
Saber-tooth.

08:02.606 --> 08:03.607
Huh?

08:09.196 --> 08:11.448
Well, where did you come from?

08:13.242 --> 08:16.912
Aw, poor girl.
Must've wandered in and got lost.

08:17.371 --> 08:18.664
I'll let you out back.

08:26.171 --> 08:27.965
Excuse me, Mr. Scarface,

08:28.048 --> 08:31.635
but isn't it cruel to take advantage
of that nice Miss Kyle?

08:32.344 --> 08:33.804
Hold my hat, will you?

08:35.806 --> 08:37.349
- Bam!
- Ow!

08:37.433 --> 08:39.685
That's what you get
for going soft on me.

08:39.768 --> 08:41.228
Yes, sir.

08:42.730 --> 08:46.650
There. The guard's putting
the cat out like I planned.

08:46.734 --> 08:48.986
<i>Catwoman should have
all the time she needs</i>

08:49.069 --> 08:50.821
<i>to lift the jewels and split.</i>

08:51.697 --> 08:53.907
This one's for the Vreelands.

08:56.744 --> 08:59.872
But plans can change, can't they, Rhino?

08:59.955 --> 09:01.623
Right, boss.

09:10.090 --> 09:11.175
Huh?

09:14.887 --> 09:17.347
Great. Someone else
is hitting the place.

09:19.808 --> 09:21.977
Okay, boys, to work.

09:40.829 --> 09:43.707
Sorry, kitty. You're taking the fall.

09:55.177 --> 09:56.220
Hold it.

09:59.306 --> 10:01.141
Could you please give me a hand?

10:01.225 --> 10:03.894
This dinosaur seems to
have fallen on me.

10:04.603 --> 10:08.232
- How did you...
- It's a dull story, handsome.

10:31.004 --> 10:32.005
The Catwoman.

10:32.589 --> 10:33.632
Watch out!

10:41.765 --> 10:44.434
- Where is she?
- Couldn't have missed her.

10:53.402 --> 10:55.612
Looks like the hunt's on again, Isis.

10:57.573 --> 11:00.033
I think a quick trip
out of town is in order.

11:00.659 --> 11:02.286
Don't buy your ticket yet.

11:05.080 --> 11:06.498
What a pleasant surprise.

11:06.915 --> 11:10.169
Though I should warn you, breaking
and entering is against the law.

11:10.669 --> 11:14.381
You would know. Care to explain what
you were doing at the museum tonight?

11:14.923 --> 11:19.136
Look, I was there earlier for a party,
and I kind of lost my temper.

11:19.428 --> 11:21.889
I went back to apologize,
and the place was empty,

11:22.181 --> 11:23.432
except for the burglars.

11:23.807 --> 11:27.227
I happened to have my outfit in the car,
and I thought if I nailed the robbers

11:27.311 --> 11:29.688
I could work up some
points with the cops.

11:30.189 --> 11:31.356
Maybe even with you.

11:33.567 --> 11:37.070
I know how bad this looks for me,
but it wasn't my fault.

11:42.326 --> 11:45.412
Would you come back to the museum
and tell your story to the authorities?

11:45.495 --> 11:48.707
I suppose, if you're with me.

11:49.249 --> 11:53.253
- After all, we do make a good team.
- When we're on the same side.

12:10.520 --> 12:12.481
The police are still
talking to the guard.

12:12.856 --> 12:14.691
That gives us a few minutes
to look around.

12:15.442 --> 12:17.319
I was looking at this exhibit earlier.

12:17.819 --> 12:21.657
It's brand-new. Why would
they remove the animals so soon?

12:26.578 --> 12:28.121
This Iock's been sprung.

12:28.205 --> 12:31.124
Our thief is clever,
using dummy cards to cover his tracks.

12:31.458 --> 12:35.003
An extinct-animal trophy is worth
a fortune to the crook who can fence it.

12:35.379 --> 12:37.881
"All those poor little
stuffed critters."

12:38.090 --> 12:40.008
That's what he was after all along.

12:40.509 --> 12:42.219
You're not telling me something.

12:42.886 --> 12:45.013
You know what's wrong
with our relationship?

12:45.555 --> 12:47.975
You always let me get too close.

12:51.603 --> 12:55.691
Excuse me.
I have a date with a scratching post.

13:17.004 --> 13:18.839
We don't have to make this difficult.

13:18.922 --> 13:21.300
But somehow we always do.

13:25.637 --> 13:26.680
Senna?

14:23.820 --> 14:24.863
In here!

14:44.466 --> 14:45.759
<i>That's fight, Penguin.</i>

14:45.842 --> 14:48.261
I got your bird just like I promised.

14:48.845 --> 14:50.889
Of course, it'll cost you extra.

14:53.141 --> 14:55.394
Hey, you don't want it, fine.

14:55.477 --> 14:58.313
I can always use it for pillow stuffing.

14:59.606 --> 15:00.607
Ah...

15:00.690 --> 15:02.984
See there? I knew you'd be reasonable.

15:05.487 --> 15:09.199
While I got you on the horn,
can I interest you in a Tasmanian tiger?

15:09.408 --> 15:11.284
A steal at only two mil.

15:13.995 --> 15:16.039
<i>SCARF ACE“. No, huh? That's okay.</i>

15:16.456 --> 15:19.376
I got a client dying
to get her paws on it.

15:27.092 --> 15:29.719
I thought I saw a pussycat.

16:01.585 --> 16:03.003
Let go!

16:07.048 --> 16:10.635
You know, I never had much use
for animals, except Rhino here.

16:10.886 --> 16:12.387
Thanks,boss.

16:12.554 --> 16:15.265
Then it hit me, some rich geeks
will pay big bucks

16:15.348 --> 16:17.517
for critters they can't go out
and shoot no more.

16:17.934 --> 16:20.103
You know what these things
are worth dead?

16:20.187 --> 16:21.771
More than my life, I bet.

16:22.272 --> 16:23.440
You win, kitten.

16:23.899 --> 16:27.360
I needed a dummy to keep the cops busy
while I grabbed the stiffs.

16:28.028 --> 16:30.739
So you conned me
into that phony jewel robbery.

16:30.822 --> 16:33.116
Too bad for you you figured it out.

16:33.617 --> 16:38.663
Now we're gonna find out if there really
is more than one way to skin a cat.

16:39.414 --> 16:41.583
- Rhino.
- No!

16:49.341 --> 16:50.425
Ow!

16:50.509 --> 16:51.885
Lousy fleabag.

17:02.312 --> 17:05.065
Oh, Great. Him, I don't need.

17:06.816 --> 17:09.319
I don't know whether to bite you
or kiss you.

17:14.115 --> 17:15.283
Later.

17:22.332 --> 17:23.708
Get me out of here.

17:29.297 --> 17:30.757
Hurry!

17:32.300 --> 17:34.427
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

17:34.928 --> 17:37.305
- Put me down.
- Sure.

17:40.267 --> 17:42.018
Uh-oh.

17:42.102 --> 17:43.520
Mr. Scarface!

17:48.149 --> 17:50.694
Let's let the chips fall where they may.

17:52.779 --> 17:55.407
Get me off of here. Dummy, help me.

18:11.047 --> 18:13.800
Help, help! Someone do something!

18:14.426 --> 18:16.177
Please, let me save him.

18:16.720 --> 18:19.097
Hmm, nah!

18:20.181 --> 18:23.310
Dummy, please!

18:33.945 --> 18:34.946
Phew!

18:36.906 --> 18:38.116
Phew!

18:47.042 --> 18:48.043
Huh?

19:00.805 --> 19:04.309
That's one way to remove a splinter.

19:07.062 --> 19:10.231
What's wrong, Ventriloquist?
Cat got your tongue?

19:10.940 --> 19:13.568
Please, I never hurt you.

19:13.943 --> 19:17.113
Scarface, he's another person.
Not me, really.

19:17.364 --> 19:19.199
But he's inside you somewhere.

19:19.532 --> 19:22.494
And I'm going to keep scratching
until I find him.

19:25.330 --> 19:27.123
Don't make it harder on yourself.

19:27.290 --> 19:30.210
- He cost me my freedom.
- No.

19:30.627 --> 19:33.088
You gave it up.
From the very start I suspected

19:33.171 --> 19:35.090
there was more to this business
than you were telling.

19:35.757 --> 19:38.593
So I put a transmitter on your cat
back at your apartment.

19:39.094 --> 19:41.346
It led me here in time to hear
your confession.

19:41.805 --> 19:44.933
- Why did you do it, Selina?
- I have to be who I am.

19:45.350 --> 19:49.646
I realize now I can't change that.
Like I told someone else tonight...

19:50.271 --> 19:51.815
It's just the cat in me.

20:00.949 --> 20:03.952
It's priceless, Batman.
The last of its kind.

20:04.202 --> 20:06.955
Will you take me in
or let it become extinct again?

20:07.330 --> 20:09.999
The lady or the tiger, darling.

20:10.083 --> 20:11.251
Your choice.

20:35.233 --> 20:38.361
<i>lam the cat who
walks by herself.</i>

21:16.983 --> 21:21.983
English - SDH
