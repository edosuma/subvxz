00:00.001 --> 00:03.402
<i>Previously on</i> reign...
Go and tell catherine
her daughter's here.

00:03.404 --> 00:07.106
Tell everyone that
princess claude is home.

00:07.108 --> 00:08.707
Lola:
<i>I've been spending time</i>
<i>with narcisse,</i>

00:08.709 --> 00:10.342
<i>But I'm not sure</i>
<i>it's any of your concern.</i>

00:10.344 --> 00:12.678
I must ask you to go there
tonight, hide this envelope,

00:12.680 --> 00:14.747
<i>Help me to take control</i>
<i>of a man</i>

00:14.749 --> 00:18.150
<i>Who would spill any amount of</i>
<i>blood to get what he wanted.</i>

00:18.152 --> 00:20.486
This would require every french
subject to come forward

00:20.488 --> 00:22.254
And publicly declare
their faith to the king.

00:22.256 --> 00:24.223
People will kill each other
in the streets.

00:24.225 --> 00:26.225
Francis:
<i>Narcisse is blackmailing me.</i>

00:26.227 --> 00:29.061
When your head is cut off, along
with catherine and mary's,

00:29.063 --> 00:31.563
What do you suppose the nobles
will do to your brothers?

00:31.565 --> 00:33.532
What will happen
to your bastard son

00:33.534 --> 00:35.768
When you're not here
to protect him?

00:35.770 --> 00:37.302
Francis signed the edict.

00:37.304 --> 00:39.238
After telling me
you wouldn't sign.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.273
After telling me you knew
the edict was wrong.

00:41.275 --> 00:42.207
You are not the king
I want to rule beside.

00:42.209 --> 00:43.776
You are a coward.

00:43.778 --> 00:46.045
Perhaps you should return
to scotland.

00:46.047 --> 00:48.380
Leave me.
Leave France.

00:49.449 --> 00:51.250
You're listed here
as a catholic,

00:51.252 --> 00:53.218
Self-declared.
I am that.

00:53.220 --> 00:55.354
A believer good and true,
I swore it.

00:55.356 --> 00:58.257
Then why are there witnesses,
your brethren,

00:58.259 --> 01:00.292
Who swear they've seen you
attending protestant services?

01:00.294 --> 01:02.327
It's not true; they're lying!

01:02.329 --> 01:04.496
The only liar
here is you.

01:04.498 --> 01:08.300
The bible says,
"if your right hand

01:08.302 --> 01:10.369
"causes you to sin,
cut it off.

01:10.371 --> 01:12.771
"it is better that you lose
one part of your body

01:12.773 --> 01:16.375
Than that your whole body
go into hell."

01:16.377 --> 01:18.377
Since your lips
compel you to sin,

01:18.379 --> 01:20.612
They should be removed,

01:20.614 --> 01:22.314
Just as this deceiver's
lips were taken,

01:22.316 --> 01:24.817
So that your eternal soul
may be saved.

01:24.819 --> 01:26.251
No. I beg you.

01:26.253 --> 01:28.854
Mercy!

01:28.856 --> 01:30.255
No!

01:30.257 --> 01:32.191
(grunting)

01:32.193 --> 01:34.393
No! No!

01:34.395 --> 01:36.295
No!

01:36.297 --> 01:39.198
No! No...!

01:39.200 --> 01:41.733
(screaming)

01:41.735 --> 01:43.469
(screaming continues)

01:45.105 --> 01:47.439
(fast tempo acoustic
intro playing)

01:50.343 --> 01:52.644
â™ª they all need something

01:52.646 --> 01:57.516
â™ª to hold on to,
they all mean well â™ª

01:57.518 --> 02:01.253
â™ª you could never
feel my story â™ª

02:01.255 --> 02:05.124
â™ª it's all you know... Oh!

02:05.126 --> 02:08.327
â™ª

02:14.267 --> 02:16.435
What cardinal vasari
and his inquisitors

02:16.437 --> 02:19.404
Have been doing since they
arrived in France is barbaric.

02:19.406 --> 02:22.441
They wouldn't even be here
if not to enforce your edict

02:22.443 --> 02:25.310
That every french subject
publicly declare their faith.

02:25.312 --> 02:27.479
You are not the only one
concerned for our people.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.281
I have written a
letter to the pope

02:29.283 --> 02:32.184
Asking him to recall his
representatives back to rome.

02:32.186 --> 02:33.485
It's not enough.

02:33.487 --> 02:36.188
You need to take a harder line
against the cardinal.

02:36.190 --> 02:37.456
To defy him is
to defy the pope.

02:37.458 --> 02:38.790
And without the
pope's blessing,

02:38.792 --> 02:41.527
We would cease to
be king and queen.

02:41.529 --> 02:43.462
If you insist on second-guessing
my every move,

02:43.464 --> 02:44.863
There is a boat waiting to take
you back to scotland.

02:44.865 --> 02:46.498
As I said before.

02:46.500 --> 02:50.169
An offer that makes no more
sense now than it did then.

02:50.171 --> 02:53.305
How did we go from disagreeing
to you trying to send me away?

02:53.307 --> 02:56.208
Do you really propose
that we live separately?

02:56.210 --> 02:58.777
What would that even mean
for our rule? Or our marriage?

02:58.779 --> 03:01.180
I'm not going.

03:01.182 --> 03:03.682
I have a duty
to our people.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.918
I may have given up on trying
to understand you,

03:05.920 --> 03:08.587
But I will not give up
on France.

03:12.559 --> 03:14.326
If your goal was
to alienate your wife,

03:14.328 --> 03:15.327
I'd say you succeeded.

03:15.329 --> 03:17.496
Not enough to get her to leave.

03:18.464 --> 03:20.232
You want her in scotland

03:20.234 --> 03:21.900
So she'll be safe
from narcisse's threats.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.769
Narcisse has enough evidence
of treason

03:23.771 --> 03:26.738
To put not just my head on
a spike, but mary's as well.

03:26.740 --> 03:29.942
Until we get
rid of narcisse,

03:29.944 --> 03:31.376
I will do whatever it takes
to keep her safe.

03:31.378 --> 03:33.512
Be careful, brother.

03:33.514 --> 03:34.746
If you push mary too hard,

03:34.748 --> 03:36.648
You might not be able
to win her back.

03:36.650 --> 03:40.485
I'd rather she were alive and
in scotland than here and dead.

03:42.322 --> 03:44.623
(bell tolling)

03:47.827 --> 03:49.895
Ah, rise and shine, claude.

03:49.897 --> 03:52.464
The only people in bed past noon
are drunks and reprobates.

03:52.466 --> 03:54.967
Mother, must you be so loud?

03:54.969 --> 03:57.402
And so you?

03:57.404 --> 04:00.439
Your eyes are bloodshot and
your hair is unsalvageable.

04:00.441 --> 04:03.275
You're in no condition to meet
your future lord and husband.

04:03.277 --> 04:05.244
Husband?

04:05.246 --> 04:07.379
You can't have found
someone already.

04:07.381 --> 04:08.480
Yes, I've made a match for you

04:08.482 --> 04:10.816
With the son
of a bavarian count.

04:10.818 --> 04:12.251
Bavaria?
Mm.

04:12.253 --> 04:13.552
It's cold.

04:13.554 --> 04:14.920
And smells like sheep dung.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.388
Country life
will do you good.

04:16.390 --> 04:17.723
It's an excellent alliance.

04:17.725 --> 04:19.358
Bavaria gets
a princess, and France

04:19.360 --> 04:21.260
Will have access
to new trade routes.

04:21.262 --> 04:22.661
This isn't about trade routes.

04:22.663 --> 04:25.597
We both know you just
want to be rid of me.

04:26.833 --> 04:28.600
You didn't happen to pick up
any wigs

04:28.602 --> 04:30.035
During your misadventures,

04:30.037 --> 04:31.670
Did you?

04:31.672 --> 04:33.839
Stop it!

04:33.841 --> 04:35.707
I have no interest
in being married.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.843
Now or ever.

04:37.845 --> 04:39.511
My brother's the king.

04:39.513 --> 04:42.381
I don't see why I have to become
the property of any man.

04:42.383 --> 04:43.915
Especially some rustic bavarian.

04:43.917 --> 04:45.917
You will marry.

04:45.919 --> 04:48.287
For the advancement and survival
of the valois line.

04:48.289 --> 04:49.554
Every member of the family
contributes,

04:49.556 --> 04:52.057
And that includes you.

04:52.059 --> 04:54.793
This repair work
will take hours,

04:54.795 --> 04:58.463
So I will meet your future
fiancÃ©, and the count, alone.

04:58.465 --> 04:59.965
Have the servants
pour you a bath.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.566
You smell gamey.

05:04.937 --> 05:06.405
Here's a head start.

05:06.407 --> 05:07.706
(sputters, coughs)

05:10.310 --> 05:12.678
(crowd chatter,
horse neighing)

05:15.381 --> 05:17.516
What do you want?

05:17.518 --> 05:20.552
(grunting)

05:25.491 --> 05:27.526
Whatever you're thinking,
think twice.

05:27.528 --> 05:29.795
I was thinking
we might be friends.

05:29.797 --> 05:33.498
We have much in common:
Our faith,

05:33.500 --> 05:36.068
Our opposition to catholic
terror and violence,

05:36.070 --> 05:38.804
The fact we both have lost
loved ones to such hate.

05:38.806 --> 05:41.340
Were you close to your nephew?

05:41.342 --> 05:43.875
The boy whose murderers
the king set free?

05:43.877 --> 05:46.078
Who are you?

05:46.080 --> 05:48.413
Jacob ravell.

05:48.415 --> 05:49.614
Leader of the protestants
in this region.

05:51.417 --> 05:53.719
There's something
you should see.

05:55.588 --> 05:57.589
When we heard
the prince of condÃ©

05:57.591 --> 05:59.658
Declared himself
a protestant,

05:59.660 --> 06:01.993
We thought you might like
to meet some of your brethren.

06:01.995 --> 06:04.563
There are more civil ways
to extend an invitation.

06:04.565 --> 06:07.065
Minister (in distance):
Brothers, sisters,
fellow protestants...

06:07.067 --> 06:08.900
What is this?

06:08.902 --> 06:10.369
A protestant gathering.

06:10.371 --> 06:12.804
These are dark times
for our people.

06:12.806 --> 06:14.973
They're afraid to worship
in their villages and towns,

06:14.975 --> 06:16.641
So they come here.

06:16.643 --> 06:18.777
Your numbers are larger
than I thought.

06:18.779 --> 06:20.912
They grow every day,
despite persecution.

06:20.914 --> 06:24.683
Christians who only want
the freedom to worship.

06:26.085 --> 06:28.553
If you want to prevent them
from suffering

06:28.555 --> 06:31.123
The same fate as your nephew,
then help us.

06:31.125 --> 06:33.925
How?

06:33.927 --> 06:37.496
We hear that the king
has sent a letter to rome,

06:37.498 --> 06:39.698
Asking the pope to
recall his inquisitors.

06:39.700 --> 06:42.768
Confronting rome in
this way takes courage,

06:42.770 --> 06:45.504
And gives us hope that
francis, in his heart,

06:45.506 --> 06:46.738
Is a tolerant man.

06:47.940 --> 06:50.475
You said you needed my help.

06:50.477 --> 06:52.577
What do you need me to do?

06:52.579 --> 06:55.847
Minister:
Let us pray to our divine god,

06:55.849 --> 06:58.683
And for our king.

06:58.685 --> 06:59.951
Jacob:
We must appeal to the crown.

06:59.953 --> 07:01.553
The first step
is to get our minister

07:01.555 --> 07:04.623
An audience with
the king and queen.

07:04.625 --> 07:07.025
We can't do it.

07:07.027 --> 07:09.928
But you can.

07:11.063 --> 07:13.799
(bird screeching)

07:17.637 --> 07:19.805
(horse neighing)

07:21.641 --> 07:23.575
Rosey?

07:23.577 --> 07:26.011
(horse neighing)

07:27.613 --> 07:29.481
Rosey!

07:29.483 --> 07:31.216
Where are you,
you willful nag?

07:31.218 --> 07:33.118
(horse sputters)

07:34.787 --> 07:37.055
Lord narcisse.

07:37.057 --> 07:38.690
Lady lola.

07:38.692 --> 07:39.958
Are you looking for your horse?

07:39.960 --> 07:42.227
I just saw her ride off.

07:42.229 --> 07:43.595
Something must have spooked her.

07:43.597 --> 07:45.130
Or someone.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.933
Did you follow me
from the castle

07:47.935 --> 07:49.167
Then scare off my horse?

07:49.169 --> 07:51.703
Now why would I do that?

07:52.839 --> 07:55.073
To enjoy the pleasure

07:55.075 --> 07:57.008
Of a few moments
of your company alone?

07:57.010 --> 07:58.610
Would that flatter you?

07:58.612 --> 08:01.680
It's not so much flattering

08:01.682 --> 08:03.915
As it is inconvenient.

08:03.917 --> 08:06.585
You can't force me
to ride back with you.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.587
Lady lola,
I would never force you

08:08.589 --> 08:11.156
To do anything you didn't want.

08:11.158 --> 08:14.159
But it is a very long walk
back to the castle.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.928
Oh, yes.
It's quite far.

08:16.930 --> 08:19.564
Oh, wait, what is that
I see in the distance?

08:19.566 --> 08:21.633
Is that someone
coming to your aid?

08:21.635 --> 08:24.669
No, sorry.

08:24.671 --> 08:27.072
Perhaps it's a
very big wolf.

08:27.074 --> 08:28.640
You're the wolf.

08:28.642 --> 08:31.009
â™ª put your hand down, boy

08:31.011 --> 08:34.646
â™ª welcome to my zoo...

08:34.648 --> 08:37.215
My second wife loved
to ride as you do,

08:37.217 --> 08:39.551
Sitting forward pressed
against the pommel.

08:39.553 --> 08:42.020
She would ride around
our estate for hours.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.655
How interesting.

08:43.657 --> 08:44.956
Yes, I thought so.

08:44.958 --> 08:47.192
Especially after she told me
that that position

08:47.194 --> 08:49.561
Is particularly invigorating
for a lady.

08:49.563 --> 08:52.264
I was trying not
to crowd you.

08:52.266 --> 08:53.565
Oh, I don't mind.

08:53.567 --> 08:54.733
Though if you'd truly prefer

08:54.735 --> 08:56.968
To be pressed up...
I'm fine.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.904
You don't have to be shy,
you know.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.939
I have seen you in the bath.

09:00.941 --> 09:03.141
â™ª when I see their rune.

09:03.143 --> 09:05.176
(clicks tongue)

09:05.178 --> 09:08.313
Conde:
<i>This is the</i>

09:08.315 --> 09:09.814
Protestant minister
whose church,

09:09.816 --> 09:10.982
A barn really,

09:10.984 --> 09:12.717
Was burned down
by catholics

09:12.719 --> 09:14.719
In the same attack
that took my nephew's life.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.288
I remember him.

09:16.290 --> 09:18.123
And the tragic events
of that day.

09:18.125 --> 09:22.661
He seeks the crown's
permission to rebuild it.

09:22.663 --> 09:24.696
If you gave your blessing,
it would be

09:24.698 --> 09:26.598
A public show of support
by the king and queen.

09:26.600 --> 09:27.966
And a way to legitimize
protestant worship,

09:27.968 --> 09:29.701
If indirectly.

09:29.703 --> 09:32.737
Which is why this request
is not a small thing.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.673
It can be perceived
in many ways.

09:34.675 --> 09:36.908
At the very least, it'll imply
that the protestants

09:36.910 --> 09:38.910
Have some kind of protection.

09:42.615 --> 09:44.716
We have heard your
request from lord condÃ©.

09:44.718 --> 09:46.718
I give you permission

09:46.720 --> 09:47.819
To rebuild this place
of worship.

09:47.821 --> 09:48.987
This I will do.

09:48.989 --> 09:51.189
But it is all I will do.

09:51.191 --> 09:54.626
With respect, your majesty,
it is not enough.

09:54.628 --> 09:57.362
And I did not come here
to beg for a new barn.

09:57.364 --> 09:58.697
What are you doing?

09:58.699 --> 09:59.764
Minister:
Thanks to your edict,

09:59.766 --> 10:01.700
We are being hunted
by the vatican.

10:01.702 --> 10:04.069
You have two days
to expel cardinal vasari

10:04.071 --> 10:05.904
And his inquisitors from France.

10:05.906 --> 10:08.373
Expel the vatican?

10:08.375 --> 10:11.276
If you refuse,
at dawn on the third day,

10:11.278 --> 10:13.345
Catholics will die.

10:13.347 --> 10:16.047
We have stolen gunpowder,
pounds of it,

10:16.049 --> 10:17.248
Packed tightly and hidden,

10:17.250 --> 10:18.917
Ready to rain hellfire
a bomb.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.385
Down upon hundreds...
Arrest him!

10:20.387 --> 10:22.354
You will not

10:22.356 --> 10:24.856
Threaten the crown.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.925
And if what you
say is true,

10:26.927 --> 10:28.760
We'll find these explosives

10:28.762 --> 10:31.096
If I have to bleed it
out of you.

10:36.669 --> 10:38.370
I had no idea I was
bringing in a fanatic.

10:38.372 --> 10:39.971
The protestant leader seemed
genuine in his desire for peace.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.406
Even if the minister
doesn't speak

10:41.408 --> 10:43.842
For all protestants,
he was not working alone.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.377
He had to know
that he'd be taken

10:45.379 --> 10:46.978
And interrogated
once he delivered his threat.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.747
We must find his accomplices.

10:48.749 --> 10:50.081
Or perhaps your friend,
their leader,

10:50.083 --> 10:52.083
Or one of the peaceful
protestants

10:52.085 --> 10:54.152
Who kidnapped you.
This is not
condÃ©'s doing.

10:54.154 --> 10:57.856
There's so much anger
between the faiths now.

10:57.858 --> 10:59.157
Something like
this was coming.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.992
She's right.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.294
Whatever peace
exists is fragile.

11:03.296 --> 11:05.897
It might be best to keep this
a secret. If word leaks

11:05.899 --> 11:07.332
Of a planned protestant attack
against catholics,

11:07.334 --> 11:09.901
There will be panic
and retribution.

11:09.903 --> 11:12.671
Very well. Find out who
the minister was working with.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.205
Talk with members
of his congregation.

11:14.207 --> 11:15.974
I'll go with bash.

11:15.976 --> 11:19.044
I've seen their leaders.
Perhaps I'll recognize someone.

11:23.182 --> 11:25.850
I know you don't
care for my opinion,

11:25.852 --> 11:27.686
But would you
please let me help?

11:27.688 --> 11:29.954
I could go to them as queen
and make a personal appeal.

11:29.956 --> 11:31.423
They threatened us.

11:31.425 --> 11:33.391
If you think I would allow you
to go anywhere near...

11:33.393 --> 11:35.760
It might assuage
their anger towards us.

11:35.762 --> 11:37.929
You mean their anger towards me

11:37.931 --> 11:39.931
For my recent actions.
Even if you found them,

11:39.933 --> 11:41.366
What would you say?

11:41.368 --> 11:42.934
That you opposed me
at every turn

11:42.936 --> 11:44.703
Before I made a mess of things?

11:44.705 --> 11:47.072
They don't need to hear that,
and neither do I.

11:51.844 --> 11:54.879
I think your horse is
sufficiently rested.

11:54.881 --> 11:57.215
Oh, we'll be back
at the castle soon enough.

11:57.217 --> 12:00.218
I regret our time together
will be over.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.986
But it doesn't have
to be that way.

12:01.988 --> 12:03.154
What do you mean?

12:03.156 --> 12:05.790
You are reluctant
to be seen with me

12:05.792 --> 12:07.192
Because you fear complication,

12:07.194 --> 12:11.162
Disapproval from your king,
or your queen, who you serve.

12:11.164 --> 12:13.865
Oh, there are many other
reasons, I assure you.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.166
All of which would be moot

12:15.168 --> 12:18.737
If our meetings were,
say... Clandestine.

12:18.739 --> 12:22.907
You're proposing
we meet in secret, like thieves,

12:22.909 --> 12:24.309
Or adulterers?

12:24.311 --> 12:26.945
Well, fruit often tastes sweeter
when it's forbidden.

12:26.947 --> 12:28.913
Admit it, the prospect
intrigues you.

12:28.915 --> 12:31.149
To do something free
from the tedium

12:31.151 --> 12:33.952
And responsibility
of court life.

12:33.954 --> 12:37.355
Something you don't have
to explain or defend.

12:37.357 --> 12:41.292
Something purely
for your pleasure.

12:41.294 --> 12:44.129
I won't press you
for a response now,

12:44.131 --> 12:47.899
But you do inspire impatience.

12:49.401 --> 12:51.469
So, I would like an answer soon.

12:54.006 --> 12:56.374
Ah, gentlemen.

12:56.376 --> 12:57.942
Your majesty.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.844
May I present

12:59.846 --> 13:01.012
My son william?

13:01.014 --> 13:03.548
Your majesty. It is an honor.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.250
Ah, the dashing groom-to-be.

13:05.252 --> 13:07.118
(laughs)

13:07.120 --> 13:09.954
Oh, claude will be most taken

13:09.956 --> 13:11.923
With you.

13:11.925 --> 13:14.926
Unfortunately, she's engrossed
in her scripture study.

13:14.928 --> 13:17.829
She will join us soon though.

13:17.831 --> 13:20.498
Perhaps it's for the best,
as there is

13:20.500 --> 13:24.002
A delicate matter
to discuss.

13:26.939 --> 13:28.306
Since arriving at court,

13:28.308 --> 13:32.110
We've heard
distressing rumors

13:32.112 --> 13:34.445
About your daughter's virtue.

13:34.447 --> 13:36.581
My claude?

13:36.583 --> 13:38.349
What could you
possibly have heard?

13:38.351 --> 13:41.586
There was mention
of an improper liaison

13:41.588 --> 13:45.089
With a priest.

13:47.459 --> 13:51.029
Do you want to have
grandchildren with royal blood?

13:51.031 --> 13:54.132
Because that's quite an
accomplishment for a count.

13:54.134 --> 13:55.867
Oh, it would be a shame

13:55.869 --> 13:57.902
To forfeit that good fortune
on unfounded rumors.

13:57.904 --> 14:01.272
Since you make a point
of william marrying up,

14:01.274 --> 14:03.074
I must confess, I'm curious

14:03.076 --> 14:05.076
As to why
you'd let claude marry down.

14:05.078 --> 14:08.012
To enjoy our new friendship
with bavaria that much sooner.

14:08.014 --> 14:10.114
We are eager, as well.

14:10.116 --> 14:13.051
But I must be certain

14:13.053 --> 14:15.353
That my son will have
a chaste catholic wife.

14:15.355 --> 14:19.257
I would need assurances
of claude's virtue

14:19.259 --> 14:21.593
To proceed with this union.

14:24.463 --> 14:26.097
(chicken clucking,
goat bleating)

14:26.099 --> 14:28.266
Bash:
<i>We have some questions</i>

14:28.268 --> 14:30.034
About the minister
of your church.

14:30.036 --> 14:31.970
I hear you're
long-standing members

14:31.972 --> 14:33.104
Of his congregation.

14:33.106 --> 14:34.472
I understand your hesitation.

14:34.474 --> 14:35.974
I myself am protestant.

14:35.976 --> 14:37.909
I've had the pleasure

14:37.911 --> 14:39.410
Of meeting your leaders,
and I assure you,

14:39.412 --> 14:41.145
You have nothing to fear from me
or the king's deputy.

14:41.147 --> 14:43.581
Our minister
is a good man.

14:43.583 --> 14:46.317
He is a compassionate
and gentle soul.

14:46.319 --> 14:49.120
We hear he went to the king to
ask for our barn to be rebuilt.

14:49.122 --> 14:50.221
A proper place of worship.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.223
He   <i>di</i>go to the king.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.192
We're merely here seeking some
support for his other requests.

14:54.194 --> 14:55.493
Do you know any of

14:55.495 --> 14:57.161
The names of his
closest associates?

14:57.163 --> 14:58.930
The men he works with

14:58.932 --> 15:00.231
To protect the faithful?

15:00.233 --> 15:03.368
I can't really say,
but you might ask...

15:03.370 --> 15:06.938
(horse neighing, men shouting)

15:06.940 --> 15:09.007
Man:
This one here.

15:09.009 --> 15:11.309
Bash:
The vatican's guards.

15:11.311 --> 15:13.912
Take the man, and
search the house.

15:13.914 --> 15:16.214
They could be hiding
other heretics.

15:16.216 --> 15:17.649
Leave them alone.
They've done nothing.

15:17.651 --> 15:19.417
They've been named
by their neighbors.

15:19.419 --> 15:22.553
Cardinal vasari has ordered us
to bring in anyone suspected

15:22.555 --> 15:25.189
Of lying about
their faith.
There is no need.

15:25.191 --> 15:27.692
I'm already questioning him
by authority of the king.

15:27.694 --> 15:29.694
We don't answer to
the king or his deputy.

15:29.696 --> 15:30.695
Woman:
No!

15:30.697 --> 15:32.063
Man:
Stay back.
Oh.

15:32.065 --> 15:35.199
(men groaning)
man:
Move him out.

15:35.201 --> 15:38.036
(crying)

15:42.574 --> 15:45.076
Francis, I need to speak to you.

15:45.078 --> 15:46.444
Now is not a good time.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.579
I was with mary earlier,
and she's upset.

15:48.581 --> 15:50.214
She's upset with some frequency,

15:50.216 --> 15:51.115
To be truthful.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.517
I am aware.

15:52.519 --> 15:54.419
I'm sure you are,
and I know why.

15:54.421 --> 15:56.054
Why you push her away,

15:56.056 --> 15:57.522
Suggesting even that
she go to scotland.

15:57.524 --> 16:00.158
I know why
you do these things.

16:02.628 --> 16:05.296
I know it was you
who killed henry.

16:05.298 --> 16:08.967
Narcisse told me, and admitted
that he's been blackmailing you.

16:11.670 --> 16:13.137
This is very dangerous
knowledge, lola.

16:13.139 --> 16:14.973
Why would he tell you?

16:14.975 --> 16:17.075
Because he suspected
you might use me against him.

16:17.077 --> 16:19.377
And he wanted me
to side with him, I suppose.

16:19.379 --> 16:22.647
Has he told anyone else?
Do you know?

16:22.649 --> 16:25.149
No, I don't, but the person
that you should tell is mary.

16:25.151 --> 16:27.218
No.

16:27.220 --> 16:29.354
Narcisse's treachery
goes beyond

16:29.356 --> 16:32.123
What he might have mentioned
in your covert conversations.

16:32.125 --> 16:33.658
Narcisse told me the truth.

16:33.660 --> 16:36.194
You led me to believe
that you wanted him dead for

16:36.196 --> 16:38.196
Political reasons, when it was
in fact to protect yourself.

16:38.198 --> 16:40.465
There are many others I protect.

16:40.467 --> 16:43.501
Mary, my mother,
my brothers and our baby.

16:43.503 --> 16:46.337
Did he mention that
he threatened them, as well?

16:46.339 --> 16:48.740
He threatened our son?

16:48.742 --> 16:50.341
You sympathize with narcisse.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.143
Is that why you failed
to hide the envelope

16:52.145 --> 16:54.112
At his estate,
as I asked you to?

16:54.114 --> 16:56.381
I told you I threw it out of
my carriage window, but I lied.

16:56.383 --> 16:58.483
I planted it behind a painting
in his drawing room.

16:58.485 --> 17:00.551
I lied before
because I didn't want

17:00.553 --> 17:02.220
Narcisse's death
on my hands.

17:02.222 --> 17:03.721
Now you surely see
what he's capable of.

17:03.723 --> 17:06.257
(sighs)
the only way

17:06.259 --> 17:07.425
To save mary's life
and my marriage

17:07.427 --> 17:09.093
Is to get rid of narcisse.

17:09.095 --> 17:11.162
That envelope
contains a cipher,

17:11.164 --> 17:13.197
Which is all I need to
frame him for treason.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.233
When it is found at his
house by the royal guard,

17:15.235 --> 17:16.701
I will take his head.

17:26.445 --> 17:28.212
Catherine:
<i>I couldn't convince the count</i>

17:28.214 --> 17:30.148
Of your chastity,
but surely god can.

17:30.150 --> 17:32.483
Mother, what have you done?

17:32.485 --> 17:35.319
I'm taking advantage
of the vatican's presence here

17:35.321 --> 17:37.622
And arranging for them
to verify your virtue.

17:37.624 --> 17:40.191
It's a very simple examination.

17:40.193 --> 17:41.692
(laughs):
A virginity test?

17:41.694 --> 17:44.328
One you know
I can't possibly pass.
Which is why

17:44.330 --> 17:46.264
I'm assuring the outcome
with a sizeable donation.

17:46.266 --> 17:48.466
They will perform
the exam tomorrow.

17:48.468 --> 17:50.468
So you're going
to let some man prod at me?

17:50.470 --> 17:52.470
Mm.
While others watch?

17:52.472 --> 17:54.305
To marry some bavarian nobody?

17:54.307 --> 17:58.276
You are punishing and cold,
and I don't even understand

17:58.278 --> 18:00.278
What I'm being punished for.

18:00.280 --> 18:02.146
You know, you'll make a lovely
bride once you stop screeching.

18:02.148 --> 18:03.514
I won't do it.

18:03.516 --> 18:05.550
You can't force me to
go through with this

18:05.552 --> 18:07.285
Ridiculous test or to marry.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.287
If someone wants to
examine my virtue,

18:09.289 --> 18:12.523
They'll have to put me on a
rack and pry my legs apart.

18:12.525 --> 18:15.359
Hmm. Well, the rack it is then!

18:15.361 --> 18:18.763
We wish you a safe journey back
to your estate, lord girard.

18:18.765 --> 18:21.399
Thank you,
your majesties.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.770
It feels strange,
receiving nobles at court

18:25.772 --> 18:27.705
As if everything
is normal.

18:27.707 --> 18:29.307
If we didn't,
people would suspect

18:29.309 --> 18:30.475
That something
was wrong.

18:30.477 --> 18:32.143
I don't know
which is harder.

18:32.145 --> 18:33.244
Pretending there
isn't a device

18:33.246 --> 18:35.279
That could kill
hundreds of innocents

18:35.281 --> 18:38.649
Or pretending that we're still
a happy royal couple.

18:38.651 --> 18:40.251
CondÃ©.

18:40.253 --> 18:42.120
Did you find
the protestant leader, jacob?

18:42.122 --> 18:45.490
Actually, he found me
when I was in town.

18:45.492 --> 18:47.258
He claims that the other
leaders know nothing

18:47.260 --> 18:48.493
Of the minister's
threats.

18:48.495 --> 18:50.128
He was shocked
when I told him.

18:50.130 --> 18:51.162
And you believe him?

18:51.164 --> 18:52.330
Well, I'm
inclined to.

18:52.332 --> 18:53.731
He came to me
at great risk.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.399
He believes this act
of terror is the work

18:55.401 --> 18:57.301
Of a few fringe
radicals that want

18:57.303 --> 18:59.670
To galvanize protestants into
rising up against the crown.

18:59.672 --> 19:02.373
Does he know who they are
or where we can find them?

19:02.375 --> 19:04.675
He swore he would give
them up if he could.

19:04.677 --> 19:07.378
He knows that if this
threat comes to pass,

19:07.380 --> 19:08.880
And catholic
lives are lost,

19:08.882 --> 19:10.648
It will be the start
of a bloody fight

19:10.650 --> 19:12.450
His people want
no part of.

19:12.452 --> 19:14.185
We're running out of time.

19:14.187 --> 19:17.488
I'll see if there's any progress
with the minister.

19:17.490 --> 19:20.158
(sighs)

19:23.362 --> 19:25.429
I can't help feeling
we're missing something.

19:25.431 --> 19:27.565
What is it you fear?

19:27.567 --> 19:29.734
If the protestant radicals
want to incite mayhem

19:29.736 --> 19:32.837
By killing catholics, why not
just set off the explosion?

19:32.839 --> 19:34.405
Why send their minister,

19:34.407 --> 19:37.608
Who they know will surely be
tortured and likely killed?

19:37.610 --> 19:40.311
A minister much
beloved by his flock,

19:40.313 --> 19:42.547
People that know nothing of
the dire threat he has made.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.882
If the minister is killed,
the radicals can use

19:44.884 --> 19:47.451
His death as justification
for almost any bad act.

19:47.453 --> 19:48.953
They would create...
A martyr.

19:48.955 --> 19:50.521
And his death would inflame

19:50.523 --> 19:52.356
Even the most pacifist
of protestants.

19:52.358 --> 19:54.592
We must do everything
we can to make sure

19:54.594 --> 19:56.394
That minister stays alive.

19:56.396 --> 19:58.863
And do what you can
to help francis.

19:58.865 --> 20:02.433
He's completely shut me out,
but he might listen to you.

20:02.435 --> 20:03.968
I'll do everything
in my power.

20:03.970 --> 20:09.373
But, mary, he's a fool to
shut you out, king or not.

20:17.482 --> 20:21.252
I'm told you refuse to divulge
the location of the attack,

20:21.254 --> 20:22.753
Or the names
of your conspirators.

20:22.755 --> 20:26.490
I do not fear those
who kill the body,

20:26.492 --> 20:28.960
For the soul is eternal.

20:28.962 --> 20:31.362
It's admirable,

20:31.364 --> 20:34.398
Your willingness to sacrifice
your life for your cause.

20:35.901 --> 20:38.302
What about the lives
of your congregation?

20:38.304 --> 20:39.971
The vatican's swiss guard

20:39.973 --> 20:41.973
Have been interrogating
members of your church.

20:41.975 --> 20:43.975
What do you think
they will do

20:43.977 --> 20:45.776
When those catholic
lives are lost?

20:45.778 --> 20:48.479
How will they punish
those innocent men and women

20:48.481 --> 20:51.849
Who know nothing
of your terror or treachery,

20:51.851 --> 20:54.452
And believe that you have
their welfare at heart?

20:54.454 --> 20:56.020
(footsteps approaching)

20:57.322 --> 20:58.656
I understand that you did

20:58.658 --> 21:00.658
What you thought
you had to.

21:00.660 --> 21:03.761
But I've learned there are
unintended consequences

21:03.763 --> 21:06.564
For our actions,

21:06.566 --> 21:09.600
Where we end up harming those
we swore to protect.

21:10.936 --> 21:13.537
Tell me the location
of the attack.

21:13.539 --> 21:16.574
I swear,
before you and god,

21:16.576 --> 21:19.310
That no more harm
will come to your flock.

21:27.586 --> 21:29.320
Vauclair.

21:30.889 --> 21:33.391
It's a monastery
in laon.

21:33.393 --> 21:35.726
We hid the barrel
filled with gunpowder

21:35.728 --> 21:37.061
In the cellars,

21:37.063 --> 21:39.330
Beneath the monks'
sleeping quarters.

21:58.050 --> 21:59.617
Over here!

22:02.521 --> 22:04.722
Keep your torches away.

22:04.724 --> 22:06.557
It's a fuse.

22:18.003 --> 22:20.705
It's not gunpowder,
just sawdust.

22:20.707 --> 22:22.540
It's a decoy.

22:22.542 --> 22:24.375
We've wasted
a whole day searching,

22:24.377 --> 22:25.576
And we still don't know
where the real threat is.

22:25.578 --> 22:26.744
Look.

22:28.046 --> 22:29.747
Conde:
<i>"sanguis fluat."</i>

22:29.749 --> 22:30.881
It's latin.

22:30.883 --> 22:33.517
What does it mean?

22:33.519 --> 22:35.586
Blood will flow.

22:42.661 --> 22:46.864
(woman gasps)

22:46.866 --> 22:49.934
Claude. I trust your day
has been less than pleasant.

22:49.936 --> 22:51.936
My mother wants me
to leave court. Again.

22:51.938 --> 22:53.604
And she's trying
to marry me off to a bavarian.

22:53.606 --> 22:55.005
I heard.

22:55.007 --> 22:58.075
I don't want to go
to bavaria.
I can see that.

22:58.077 --> 23:00.444
So why don't you go somewhere
else, out of catherine's sight?

23:00.446 --> 23:02.446
Then maybe she won't
push this engagement.

23:02.448 --> 23:03.481
Where?

23:03.483 --> 23:05.583
My family
has five castles,

23:05.585 --> 23:07.752
But as a woman, I'm not
permitted to take residence

23:07.754 --> 23:10.154
In any of them,
without a guardian or a husband.

23:10.156 --> 23:11.856
What about your cousin
babette's estate?

23:11.858 --> 23:13.157
You've stayed there before.

23:13.159 --> 23:14.592
Mm, that won't work.

23:14.594 --> 23:16.527
Why?

23:16.529 --> 23:19.530
I slept with her fiancÃ©e.

23:19.532 --> 23:21.532
Just once.

23:21.534 --> 23:23.534
On a dare.

23:23.536 --> 23:26.537
Oh, why is everyone
so judgmental?

23:26.539 --> 23:27.705
It's worse out there,

23:27.707 --> 23:29.473
In the countryside,

23:29.475 --> 23:31.909
Which is why I want
to stay here.

23:31.911 --> 23:33.477
It's not a return
to court you desire.

23:33.479 --> 23:35.980
It's the very best
place to be a princess.

23:35.982 --> 23:37.181
It's your
mother's attention.

23:37.183 --> 23:38.883
Why would I want
anything from her?

23:38.885 --> 23:40.718
She doesn't love me.

23:40.720 --> 23:43.020
Not the way she loves francis
or any of her other children.

23:43.022 --> 23:45.423
You're right.

23:45.425 --> 23:48.459
She doesn't.
You've always known it.

23:48.461 --> 23:51.061
I suppose that's what drew me
to you when we were children.

23:51.063 --> 23:53.097
I knew what it was like
to feel catherine's anger.

23:53.099 --> 23:56.000
Her resentment.

23:56.002 --> 23:57.902
That's the last
thing I need.

23:57.904 --> 24:01.205
My bastard brother
feeling sorry for me.

24:01.207 --> 24:04.108
Maybe it's time to move on.

24:04.110 --> 24:06.510
You could view this marriage
not as a punishment,

24:06.512 --> 24:08.212
But as an opportunity.

24:08.214 --> 24:10.548
A new start somewhere
where you have a chance

24:10.550 --> 24:13.184
At finding happiness
and love.

24:17.722 --> 24:20.891
(knocking)

24:20.893 --> 24:22.860
(clears throat)

24:22.862 --> 24:24.862
Bash.

24:24.864 --> 24:26.063
To what do I owe

24:26.065 --> 24:27.765
This rare delight?

24:27.767 --> 24:28.999
Bavarian trade routes.

24:29.001 --> 24:31.035
Oh.

24:31.037 --> 24:33.504
I looked into the count whose
son you want claude to marry.

24:33.506 --> 24:36.173
The commerce in his
region is sparse.

24:36.175 --> 24:38.509
It's not the great alliance
you've made it out to be.

24:38.511 --> 24:40.044
So why are you pushing
this marriage?

24:40.046 --> 24:41.779
You're an economist now.

24:41.781 --> 24:43.581
You know where
merchants travel.

24:43.583 --> 24:45.082
I know your motives
are often concealed.

24:45.084 --> 24:47.084
And I don't want claude
to be a casualty of them.

24:47.086 --> 24:50.020
It's sweet that you're feeling
like you want to protect claude,

24:50.022 --> 24:52.089
But you're
overstepping your bounds

24:52.091 --> 24:53.724
As her...

24:53.726 --> 24:55.626
Brother?

24:55.628 --> 24:57.261
It wouldn't be the first time.

24:57.263 --> 25:00.531
Has she enlisted your help
in trying to intervene with me?

25:00.533 --> 25:02.800
Actually, I encouraged her
not to fight the engagement.

25:02.802 --> 25:05.269
I think she'll be happier
in a place where she has

25:05.271 --> 25:06.270
A chance of
being loved.

25:06.272 --> 25:09.106
I love all my children.

25:09.108 --> 25:11.842
Protecting them, keeping them
safe-- it's what drives

25:11.844 --> 25:13.644
My existence.

25:13.646 --> 25:15.179
Oh, you see?

25:15.181 --> 25:17.548
You've caught me
in a reflective mood.

25:17.550 --> 25:20.951
Each of their names
in my gaze as I pray.

25:20.953 --> 25:24.188
I do, I pray for their souls
and for mine,

25:24.190 --> 25:25.990
More than you might imagine.

25:25.992 --> 25:28.993
I treasure my family,

25:28.995 --> 25:31.195
Even the ones
who didn't survive.

25:31.197 --> 25:33.130
There was louis.

25:33.132 --> 25:35.199
He was after francis.

25:35.201 --> 25:38.569
I lost him
when he was only a year.

25:38.571 --> 25:41.105
And then there was emone
and henriette.

25:41.107 --> 25:44.141
Oh, they were so...
They were tiny

25:44.143 --> 25:45.142
When they were born.

25:45.144 --> 25:47.878
Twin girls.
Passed as infants.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.113
Twins, but not identical.

25:49.115 --> 25:52.016
I saw little differences,
even as babes.

25:52.018 --> 25:54.151
I used to wonder
what they would look like

25:54.153 --> 25:55.553
If they could have grown.

25:55.555 --> 25:59.657
Obsessed, for a time,
you might say.

25:59.659 --> 26:04.595
The oldest that I could
imagine them was eight.

26:04.597 --> 26:06.864
Nine?

26:09.134 --> 26:11.135
Each with her own features.

26:16.975 --> 26:19.043
Catherine, are
you all right?

26:21.246 --> 26:24.782
I have been a bit
liberal with my intake. Hmm.

26:24.784 --> 26:28.919
It's my nerves,
given recent events.

26:28.921 --> 26:31.322
Catherine, I know
things have been tense.

26:31.324 --> 26:34.258
But you have a living daughter
who needs your affection now.

26:34.260 --> 26:35.859
You say you love claude.

26:35.861 --> 26:37.695
Well, give her some
evidence of it

26:37.697 --> 26:39.196
Before you send her away.

26:39.198 --> 26:41.231
You owe her that much.

26:58.183 --> 27:00.684
(chuckles softly)

27:05.323 --> 27:09.259
Man:
<i>My lord, an urgent message.</i>

27:11.196 --> 27:13.897
Lord narcisse is back
from his country manor.

27:13.899 --> 27:15.232
Notify the head
of the kingsguard.

27:15.234 --> 27:17.034
I need men ready
to leave. Now.

27:17.036 --> 27:19.103
(horse neighs)

27:27.278 --> 27:29.346
Stephan narcisse, you are
suspected of treason.

27:29.348 --> 27:30.981
By authority of the king,
you will submit

27:30.983 --> 27:32.216
To a search of your house.

27:32.218 --> 27:34.652
This is an outrage.
I've committed

27:34.654 --> 27:36.687
No crime against the crown.

27:39.991 --> 27:43.160
Francis:
<i>Bash and the guards searched</i>
<i>narcisse's home thoroughly.</i>

27:43.162 --> 27:45.796
The cipher was no longer
where you planted it.

27:45.798 --> 27:49.299
He must have found it and surely
knows that you put it there.

27:49.301 --> 27:53.237
I was with him just yesterday;
he didn't let on at all.

27:53.239 --> 27:55.305
This was my only means
of disabling

27:55.307 --> 27:57.241
His hold on me,
and it failed.

27:57.243 --> 28:00.978
Now I may have put you
in danger by involving you.

28:00.980 --> 28:02.980
I'll assign a guard for
your safety, in the event

28:02.982 --> 28:04.314
That narcisse tries
to retaliate.

28:04.316 --> 28:06.016
I can't have a guard
following me around.

28:06.018 --> 28:07.284
How would I explain
it to mary?

28:07.286 --> 28:09.386
Make up a reason.
No.

28:09.388 --> 28:12.356
If narcisse is intent on
harming me, he'll find a way,

28:12.358 --> 28:13.991
But I doubt he'd be
that reckless.

28:13.993 --> 28:16.060
(knocking)
enter.

28:16.062 --> 28:17.861
Your majesty.

28:17.863 --> 28:21.331
Urgent news from lord condÃ©
and the search party.

28:26.304 --> 28:29.273
We searched the monastery
and found nothing.

28:29.275 --> 28:31.108
Except a warning
in latin:

28:31.110 --> 28:33.310
"sanguis fluat."
"blood will flow."

28:33.312 --> 28:36.480
So the minister lied about
the location of the device?

28:36.482 --> 28:38.282
More likely, his cohorts
lied to him so he couldn't

28:38.284 --> 28:39.750
Divulge the true location
even under torture.

28:39.752 --> 28:42.219
He's still our only hope.

28:42.221 --> 28:43.887
Even if he doesn't
know where it is,

28:43.889 --> 28:46.223
He could give us the name
of his conspirators.

28:46.225 --> 28:48.092
If the minister is still alive.

28:48.094 --> 28:49.893
I doubt he will be
after francis hears of this.

28:49.895 --> 28:51.962
(grunting)

28:51.964 --> 28:54.364
I gave you a chance to save
yourself and your people,

28:54.366 --> 28:57.434
And this is how you repay me?

28:57.436 --> 29:00.771
(groaning loudly)

29:00.773 --> 29:02.773
(panting)

29:02.775 --> 29:05.876
I-I told you the truth,
I swear it.

29:05.878 --> 29:07.411
I put the device there
with my own hands.

29:07.413 --> 29:09.346
You sent my men
on a futile hunt!

29:09.348 --> 29:11.515
They found nothing
but sawdust and threats!

29:11.517 --> 29:14.985
No, no, that's not...
That's not possible.

29:14.987 --> 29:16.887
They lied to me.

29:18.323 --> 29:20.290
By "they," you mean
your conspirators?

29:20.292 --> 29:22.826
Tell me their names.

29:22.828 --> 29:23.794
More!

29:23.796 --> 29:26.363
(groaning loudly)

29:27.866 --> 29:30.300
Tell me their names,

29:30.302 --> 29:34.338
Or I swear I'll have your arms
ripped from your body!

29:34.340 --> 29:36.073
Francis, stop!
Stay out of it, mary.

29:36.075 --> 29:38.075
You're killing him.

29:38.077 --> 29:39.877
Even if he doesn't know
where it is, we can't afford

29:39.879 --> 29:41.979
To make him a martyr.

29:41.981 --> 29:45.149
Don't let the act of one man
poison thousands against us.

29:49.921 --> 29:51.922
(bones crack)

29:51.924 --> 29:53.991
Stop. Take him off.

29:56.261 --> 29:58.428
Bone's dislodged from
the socket, your majesty.

29:58.430 --> 30:01.131
(grunting)

30:05.270 --> 30:08.272
(quiet groaning)

30:08.274 --> 30:11.842
I never meant
for any of this to happen.

30:11.844 --> 30:13.911
I hope you know that.

30:25.423 --> 30:27.291
I didn't hear from you
about my offer.

30:27.293 --> 30:29.193
(gasps)

30:29.195 --> 30:31.528
Though attempting to
frame me for treason

30:31.530 --> 30:33.530
Should be answer
enough, I suppose.

30:33.532 --> 30:35.365
When did you know?

30:35.367 --> 30:38.468
I found the item you planted
soon after you visited.

30:40.405 --> 30:44.541
When the kingsguard
didn't immediately arrive,

30:44.543 --> 30:46.543
I thought you'd had
a change of heart.

30:46.545 --> 30:48.278
I did, but...

30:48.280 --> 30:49.980
But what?

30:49.982 --> 30:51.882
It saddens me

30:51.884 --> 30:54.251
That you chose
francis--

30:54.253 --> 30:58.222
A weak, patricidal king--

30:58.224 --> 31:01.491
Over the future we
might have shared.

31:01.493 --> 31:03.527
You told me
you were a patriot,

31:03.529 --> 31:05.429
Resorting to blackmail
for the good of France.

31:05.431 --> 31:08.131
Was it also for the good
of France to threaten my baby,

31:08.133 --> 31:10.334
My queen, my friends?

31:10.336 --> 31:12.069
I merely warned francis

31:12.071 --> 31:15.038
Of the consequences should
his line be deposed.

31:15.040 --> 31:17.040
I thought it might motivate
him to be a better ruler.

31:17.042 --> 31:18.408
I'm to believe it was a tactic?

31:18.410 --> 31:21.545
I would never hurt
your baby, lola.

31:21.547 --> 31:24.648
But don't misunderstand--
your child is at risk,

31:24.650 --> 31:26.583
And always will be,
as the son of the king.

31:26.585 --> 31:29.553
And there is a
target on your back

31:29.555 --> 31:33.023
As well.

31:33.025 --> 31:35.359
You could've used
the extra safety

31:35.361 --> 31:37.527
My friendship
would have offered.

31:37.529 --> 31:39.529
You are no friend.

31:39.531 --> 31:41.999
Or patriot.

31:42.001 --> 31:44.034
You're just a dangerous man.

31:44.036 --> 31:45.569
Well, perhaps
it's escaped your notice,

31:45.571 --> 31:48.105
But the world is
a dangerous place!

31:48.107 --> 31:49.373
And one day,
you will wish you had

31:49.375 --> 31:51.909
Someone like me
to protect you from it.

31:55.346 --> 31:58.181
Man:
<i>Your highness, it's time.</i>

32:02.253 --> 32:06.056
Princess, this will
be over soon.

32:13.097 --> 32:15.065
(grunting quietly)

32:38.022 --> 32:40.023
The minister
isn't recovering.

32:40.025 --> 32:42.592
His arm has been set,
but there are signs

32:42.594 --> 32:44.561
Of bleeding under the skin,
pooling near his chest.

32:44.563 --> 32:48.632
Isn't there a physician
or a surgeon who can heal him?

32:48.634 --> 32:50.067
There is a skilled healer
in epernay,

32:50.069 --> 32:51.635
But that's half a day's
ride from here.

32:51.637 --> 32:53.637
By the time we send word and
he arrives, it'll be too late.

32:53.639 --> 32:56.573
We have to keep this minister
alive, at all costs.

32:56.575 --> 32:59.609
Take the minister to epernay.
It'll save time.

33:09.253 --> 33:10.687
Come.

33:25.470 --> 33:29.473
I'm sorry you had to endure
that wretched procedure.

33:34.412 --> 33:37.047
You look so beautiful.

33:39.617 --> 33:43.120
It may not seem like it now,
but it is for your own good

33:43.122 --> 33:46.790
That you will soon be married
and away from this castle.

33:46.792 --> 33:49.092
Why?

33:50.762 --> 33:53.196
Nanny:
<i>All the nannies</i>

33:53.198 --> 33:55.565
Are struggling with her,
your majesty.

33:55.567 --> 33:57.267
I wouldn't be
so direct, but...

33:57.269 --> 33:59.269
No, I asked. Go on.

33:59.271 --> 34:00.804
Princess claude is...

34:00.806 --> 34:03.206
Well, she's very jealous
of the little ones.

34:03.208 --> 34:06.343
She says they paw at her
and that they ruin things.

34:06.345 --> 34:08.445
Ruin what, exactly?

34:08.447 --> 34:10.380
My dress.

34:10.382 --> 34:11.681
They pulled the flowers off it.

34:11.683 --> 34:13.617
Nanny: She says
they ruin everything.

34:13.619 --> 34:15.585
She looks at them
with such hatred.

34:15.587 --> 34:17.054
She pinches them.

34:17.056 --> 34:19.089
(baby crying)

34:19.091 --> 34:21.658
Claude, is that true?

34:21.660 --> 34:24.094
(exhales)
I'm not pleased.

34:24.096 --> 34:26.063
(crying continues)
shh, shh, shh.

34:26.065 --> 34:28.432
All right.

34:31.102 --> 34:33.437
(babies crying)
shh, shh.

34:36.541 --> 34:38.775
Mother...

34:38.777 --> 34:41.478
What is it?

34:41.480 --> 34:42.746
(sighs)

34:42.748 --> 34:44.781
Oh, the things that
I've done for you.

34:44.783 --> 34:47.250
How I have protected you.

34:47.252 --> 34:49.286
Do you think that
I don't love you?

34:49.288 --> 34:51.121
You can't see?

34:51.123 --> 34:54.691
In my way, I have mothered you
more than any of my children.

34:54.693 --> 34:58.161
Then don't make me marry.

34:58.163 --> 34:59.830
Don't make me leave.

35:06.370 --> 35:08.772
It's done.

35:21.586 --> 35:23.320
(horse neighs)

35:23.322 --> 35:25.689
Whoa! We've got
to move this tree!

35:25.691 --> 35:27.624
(arrows whooshes)
(grunts)

35:33.231 --> 35:35.398
(horse neighs)

35:38.703 --> 35:41.605
(grunting, panting)

35:41.607 --> 35:43.673
Ah, my brothers.

35:43.675 --> 35:45.842
Thank god
you found me.

35:45.844 --> 35:48.211
I told them the bomb was in
laon, and they found nothing,

35:48.213 --> 35:50.747
But I fear
I've betrayed our cause.

35:50.749 --> 35:53.683
I assure you, father,
you have not.

35:54.819 --> 35:56.520
(grunts)

35:56.522 --> 35:58.522
You couldn't betray us,

35:58.524 --> 36:00.524
Because there was
never a bomb.

36:00.526 --> 36:01.758
(grunts)

36:04.562 --> 36:06.830
(horses neighing)

36:12.837 --> 36:16.806
To have brought this matter
before the vatican. (chuckles)

36:16.808 --> 36:19.776
You have showed us more
consideration than we deserve.

36:19.778 --> 36:21.545
Oh.

36:21.547 --> 36:25.315
I regret any misunderstandings
I may have caused.

36:25.317 --> 36:29.286
It will be my honor
to call princess claude family.

36:29.288 --> 36:31.721
Oh, what a lovely sentiment.

36:31.723 --> 36:33.790
â™ª

36:41.699 --> 36:43.366
Lord narcisse.

36:43.368 --> 36:44.968
We haven't had
the pleasure.

36:44.970 --> 36:46.369
Your very friendly

36:46.371 --> 36:48.505
Introduction
is a delight,

36:48.507 --> 36:49.739
Princess.

36:49.741 --> 36:51.875
Though I suspect
it's just a show

36:51.877 --> 36:53.276
For your mother.

36:55.813 --> 36:57.881
Which is a pity,

36:57.883 --> 37:00.850
Because I find myself
recently unattached,

37:00.852 --> 37:04.221
And I might...
Enjoy your company.

37:04.223 --> 37:05.922
(laughs softly)

37:05.924 --> 37:08.892
I like a man who can so firmly
express his interest.

37:08.894 --> 37:11.761
Though I should warn you,
I'm not some hapless priest

37:11.763 --> 37:13.430
Or one of those boys

37:13.432 --> 37:14.764
You toy with.

37:14.766 --> 37:17.367
Are you sure
you're up to the challenge?

37:19.337 --> 37:20.971
Uh... Before you get up,
princess,

37:20.973 --> 37:24.474
Would you do me the kindness
of passing me my cape?

37:26.277 --> 37:28.478
â™ª

37:44.929 --> 37:46.463
Catherine:
<i>I woke up</i>

37:46.465 --> 37:48.898
Thinking something was wrong.

37:48.900 --> 37:52.002
The babies were too quiet. I...

37:52.004 --> 37:55.005
I went to the nursery
to check on them, and...

37:55.007 --> 37:57.807
At first, I thought
they were still asleep.

37:57.809 --> 37:59.876
(sobbing):
I tried to rouse them.

37:59.878 --> 38:01.945
My emone. (sniffles)

38:01.947 --> 38:03.913
My henrietta.

38:03.915 --> 38:06.616
They were suffocated.

38:06.618 --> 38:08.718
It was hard to see
at first,

38:08.720 --> 38:11.421
Until I looked into
their windpipes and found this.

38:12.857 --> 38:15.392
One in each of their throats.

38:15.394 --> 38:16.993
No!

38:16.995 --> 38:18.461
(sobbing)

38:24.902 --> 38:26.336
(door creaks open)

38:27.872 --> 38:30.307
Bash, you're wounded.
They say I'll recover.

38:30.309 --> 38:31.941
I hope quickly.

38:31.943 --> 38:34.611
We were traveling when we
got word of the attack.

38:34.613 --> 38:36.746
I'm sorry that you
lost your men.

38:36.748 --> 38:37.947
Thankfully,
bash made it out alive

38:37.949 --> 38:40.317
And had the good sense
to come here.

38:40.319 --> 38:41.785
Bash: CondÃ©'s town home was
the closest place I could

38:41.787 --> 38:43.553
Think to go where
I knew I'd be safe.

38:43.555 --> 38:44.988
What happened?

38:44.990 --> 38:46.956
We were ambushed
by armed men.

38:46.958 --> 38:49.326
They knew we were
transporting the minister.

38:49.328 --> 38:50.960
I think they were his
protestant comrades;

38:50.962 --> 38:53.563
He seemed to
know them.

38:53.565 --> 38:54.964
They took the minister
with them?

38:54.966 --> 38:58.835
But not before they ran
him through with a sword.

38:58.837 --> 39:00.503
Why would they kill
one of their own?

39:00.505 --> 39:01.938
There's more.

39:01.940 --> 39:03.606
I heard them say that
there is no bomb.

39:03.608 --> 39:06.376
There never was.
Well, that makes no sense.

39:06.378 --> 39:09.546
Why threaten the crown with
something that doesn't exist?

39:10.581 --> 39:12.816
Francis:
What is it?

39:12.818 --> 39:14.551
There's a disturbance
in the town.

39:14.553 --> 39:16.386
Something to do
with the minister.

39:20.024 --> 39:22.092
(crowd murmuring)

39:30.134 --> 39:33.570
Man: Hanged like a heretic!
This is the crown's doing!

39:33.572 --> 39:36.439
They have to know
it was not our doing.

39:36.441 --> 39:38.608
I must tell them.
No. It's not safe.

39:38.610 --> 39:42.379
Your faith is blasphemy.

39:42.381 --> 39:44.080
It won't stop with our minister.

39:44.082 --> 39:46.516
They won't stop until
they've killed us all!

39:46.518 --> 39:48.051
This is what the
radicals wanted--

39:48.053 --> 39:50.420
For the protestants to rise up
against the catholics,

39:50.422 --> 39:51.621
Against us.

39:51.623 --> 39:52.922
When we didn't kill

39:52.924 --> 39:54.090
Their minister,
they did it themselves.

39:54.092 --> 39:55.625
"blood will flow."

39:55.627 --> 39:57.627
This is their bomb.

39:57.629 --> 40:00.163
Protestant heretics
deserve what they get!

40:00.165 --> 40:01.698
Man:
To hell with your pope

40:01.700 --> 40:02.999
And your vicious king!
(spits)

40:03.001 --> 40:05.702
Guard:
I order you to stand back!

40:05.704 --> 40:08.605
Get back! Get back!
(crowd clamoring)

40:12.109 --> 40:13.543
You must leave.

40:13.545 --> 40:14.611
Now.

40:16.580 --> 40:18.047
You'll be safe here.

40:18.049 --> 40:19.949
I'll get your carriage.

40:22.987 --> 40:25.121
You did this to us.

40:25.123 --> 40:27.490
To France.

40:27.492 --> 40:30.560
For all that you claim
you're trying to protect us,

40:30.562 --> 40:33.997
I have lost all faith in you
and the man I thought you were.

40:46.010 --> 40:48.011
(cooing)

40:48.013 --> 40:50.880
â™ª

40:53.651 --> 40:58.021
He is the only pure and joyful
thing that remains in my life.

40:58.023 --> 41:00.223
I've ruined everything.

41:00.225 --> 41:02.125
My marriage,

41:02.127 --> 41:05.695
My rule,

41:05.697 --> 41:07.630
Perhaps the future of France.

41:07.632 --> 41:10.934
I can't imagine the
weight of your burdens.

41:10.936 --> 41:14.604
But I understand why you've
done the things you have.

41:14.606 --> 41:16.005
You love your wife...

41:16.007 --> 41:17.740
Your family.

41:19.643 --> 41:21.644
You're a good man, francis.

41:21.646 --> 41:25.648
â™ª run, run

41:25.650 --> 41:28.751
â™ª so far from each other...
