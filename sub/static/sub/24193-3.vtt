00:52.719 --> 00:54.346
The guy canceled the operation.

00:54.429 --> 00:56.932
Ibrahim knows and will
destroy the evidence.

00:57.349 --> 00:58.809
I know. Verena's fucked.

00:59.977 --> 01:00.894
OK.

01:08.527 --> 01:13.490
CURITIBA - FEDERAL POLICE

01:16.243 --> 01:17.619
Guilhome was right.

01:19.037 --> 01:20.789
I was fucked.

01:41.643 --> 01:44.771
But he didn't count on the love
of a father for his daughter.

01:44.855 --> 01:46.481
Hello. Dad?

01:46.565 --> 01:48.650
- Alice.
- Did you get in OK?

01:49.109 --> 01:50.694
Yes, sweetie. Go back to sleep.

01:51.653 --> 01:54.364
I'll be back Wednesday. Pick
you up at the ballet class.

01:54.448 --> 01:56.241
- OK.
- I love you.

01:56.742 --> 01:59.077
I love you too. Bye.

01:59.161 --> 02:00.370
Bye, honey.

02:03.957 --> 02:07.294
The sfiha salesman was
betrayed by a noble sentiment.

02:08.002 --> 02:09.003
Fuck him.

02:16.511 --> 02:18.639
- Hey.
- Where are you?

02:20.515 --> 02:21.808
I'm at the car.

02:23.101 --> 02:25.937
I followed Kitano to a club
and I haven't left yet.

02:26.021 --> 02:27.397
I have good news.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.358
- I found Ibrahim.
- What? Where?

02:29.441 --> 02:31.151
In Brasília, North Wing.

02:31.234 --> 02:34.905
Nobody flees to Brasília. He has
no clue about the operation.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.532
OK. List all five-star
hotels in the area.

02:37.616 --> 02:40.077
Call them until you find him.

03:02.140 --> 03:03.683
- Yes, Verena.
- China!

03:03.767 --> 03:06.144
It's back on. Ibrahim showed
up and he's clueless.

03:06.228 --> 03:08.146
Roberval canceled the operation.

03:08.230 --> 03:09.439
- What time is it?
- Wait.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.274
He did, but I just reinstated it.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.485
Search and seizure, 6 a.m. at his house.

03:13.568 --> 03:14.736
Tear the place apart.

03:16.947 --> 03:19.491
I'm sorry, but we have no one
by that name staying here.

03:19.574 --> 03:20.951
OK, thanks.

03:34.339 --> 03:35.632
Vander! Wake up.

03:35.716 --> 03:38.135
Go back to JPR's place. We're back on.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.344
I never left.

03:39.428 --> 03:42.097
Even better. I'll send you back-up.

03:42.180 --> 03:43.849
Go in at the agreed time, OK?

03:45.016 --> 03:46.143
Sure.

03:51.106 --> 03:52.524
- Verena?
- Roberval.

03:52.691 --> 03:53.942
The operation is back on.

03:54.025 --> 03:55.736
What do you mean? Ibrahim escaped.

03:55.819 --> 03:58.488
Ibrahim turned up in Brasília.
I'm on his tail.

03:58.572 --> 04:01.283
Verena, it's 4 a.m.!
That's not how it works.

04:01.366 --> 04:03.535
We need an official
statement for the units!

04:03.618 --> 04:05.120
Already done.

04:05.203 --> 04:06.329
Wait, Verena!

04:06.705 --> 04:07.748
Jerk.

04:08.999 --> 04:10.417
We need three more units.

04:10.500 --> 04:13.044
One goes for Chebab, another
one arrests Kitano,

04:13.128 --> 04:14.379
and two more with us.

04:14.463 --> 04:15.505
Where are we going?

04:19.134 --> 04:20.051
Good evening.

04:21.094 --> 04:24.765
Do you have a guest
named Roberto Ibrahim?

04:25.724 --> 04:30.103
The administration is changing
secretaries to strengthen their chances

04:30.187 --> 04:33.648
of reelection by gaining new voters.

04:33.732 --> 04:36.443
Opponents are also working
on their strategies...

04:36.526 --> 04:37.360
Hello.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.867
Bingo!

04:43.950 --> 04:48.622
fundamental matters among financial
policies facing the ghost of inflation...

04:48.705 --> 04:52.667
and the assurance of investments
are essential to reestablish...

04:52.751 --> 04:57.255
the confidence of businessmen and
allow for the country to grow again.

04:57.339 --> 05:02.511
To comment on this, I've invited reporter
Gabriela Rufino from Politics Today...

05:02.594 --> 05:03.845
and Lucas Frias from...

05:04.387 --> 05:05.430
Good evening.

05:05.847 --> 05:09.768
Someone just called my
room but the call dropped.

05:10.185 --> 05:12.521
Could you please tell me
the number that called?

05:19.319 --> 05:20.153
Go ahead.

05:28.119 --> 05:30.247
OK, thank you. Good night.

05:44.844 --> 05:49.599
You have reached Paraná's Federal
Police Regional Superintendency.

06:14.124 --> 06:18.128
Nilsinho! Champagne on
ice at my table, please.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.129
A beer, please.

06:46.823 --> 06:49.868
MY LINE IS TAPPED

07:02.797 --> 07:04.758
Verena. Found him.

07:04.841 --> 07:05.884
Write it down.

07:05.967 --> 07:08.762
North Wing, block...

08:01.106 --> 08:03.441
- I'm getting busted.
- What?

08:04.484 --> 08:06.069
I'll be arrested in the morning.

08:06.152 --> 08:08.154
I need you to deliver the money tomorrow.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.409
Forget the money. The plane is here.

08:13.118 --> 08:15.537
Where would I go? I have a family.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.624
It's alright. Just deliver the money, OK?

08:38.934 --> 08:41.062
- Hello.
- I'm being arrested.

08:41.980 --> 08:43.648
There's a cold wind from the South.

08:43.898 --> 08:48.319
Stay calm. We'll take care of it.
I'll think of an attorney for you.

08:48.403 --> 08:50.530
I'm calm and I do have an attorney.

08:50.613 --> 08:53.324
Try to stop this circus they're
setting up in Curitiba.

10:18.368 --> 10:19.619
Wilma Kitano?

10:21.329 --> 10:22.497
You are under arrest.

10:29.045 --> 10:30.547
You've got a strong grip.

10:38.346 --> 10:40.849
Mr. Chebab, you are under arrest.
Out of the car.

11:18.303 --> 11:19.470
I have a warrant.

11:19.971 --> 11:21.097
You, come with me.

12:02.347 --> 12:03.765
Mr. Roberto Ibrahim.

12:03.848 --> 12:05.892
You don't look a day older, Deputy.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.019
Still single?

12:08.436 --> 12:09.979
You're under arrest.

12:10.980 --> 12:11.940
Go in.

12:13.024 --> 12:14.025
Hello.

12:14.108 --> 12:15.318
Good morning.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.153
What about your pal?

12:18.071 --> 12:19.572
Couldn't make it this time?

12:19.948 --> 12:21.491
Is the madman still alive?

12:22.158 --> 12:24.410
- Obsessed?
- Quiet, please.

12:33.002 --> 12:34.295
OK. Perfect.

12:34.379 --> 12:36.297
Bring everything in.

12:36.381 --> 12:38.257
Cell phone too.

12:38.841 --> 12:40.176
OK?

12:49.477 --> 12:51.396
Verena caught her currency dealers.

12:54.190 --> 12:55.400
Congratulations, sir.

12:55.900 --> 12:58.069
Yes. That was good.

13:14.293 --> 13:17.005
Go, get my purse. It's
in the living room.

13:17.088 --> 13:18.339
Yes, ma'am.

13:21.426 --> 13:24.971
This number is currently out of service.

13:53.541 --> 13:55.418
I'm a lawyer. You can't come in.

13:56.794 --> 13:59.172
Mrs. Stella, we have a search warrant.

13:59.255 --> 14:02.133
I need you to come with us, please.
Excuse me.

14:03.926 --> 14:05.094
Just a minute.

14:07.096 --> 14:10.350
No! Alice, go back to your room. Go.

14:13.603 --> 14:14.812
We'll search here first.

14:15.229 --> 14:16.606
Please stay calm, ma'am.

14:17.315 --> 14:18.691
We'll go upstairs after.

14:20.443 --> 14:22.362
What's going on? Was Roberto arrested?

14:24.072 --> 14:25.573
It's all there, ma'am.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.750
Good morning, Mrs. Samira Rangel?

14:35.833 --> 14:37.960
- That's me.
- I'm Deputy Bastos.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.296
We're here to serve a bench warrant.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.465
- What's that?
- We have a warrant

14:42.548 --> 14:45.259
against your husband João Pedro Rangel.

14:46.469 --> 14:47.887
How many people in the house?

14:48.388 --> 14:51.724
Me, my husband and my grandson,
who is staying over today.

14:51.808 --> 14:53.351
What are you doing here?

14:54.644 --> 14:58.523
What do you want, for God's sake? If
you let me know, maybe I could help.

14:58.606 --> 14:59.482
Easy.

14:59.565 --> 15:01.234
- What's your name?
- Cibele.

15:01.317 --> 15:03.361
Can you please bring the kid here?

15:03.444 --> 15:05.488
Wait. Why can't I go?

15:05.822 --> 15:08.074
Mrs. Samira, is there
anyone else at home?

15:08.157 --> 15:08.991
No.

15:09.951 --> 15:11.494
- Are you sure?
- I am.

15:11.661 --> 15:13.746
- What's going on?
- Look!

15:16.666 --> 15:19.085
- Mr. João Pedro Rangel?
- Yes.

15:19.502 --> 15:20.586
Good morning.

15:20.670 --> 15:22.422
We have a bench warrant against you.

15:24.090 --> 15:24.924
And the Evoque?

15:27.093 --> 15:29.011
- In the garage?
- Yes.

15:29.804 --> 15:31.973
Would you take us to the car, please?

15:32.432 --> 15:33.850
We need its papers.

15:35.393 --> 15:36.519
This way.

15:37.311 --> 15:38.855
Would you come with me?

15:40.857 --> 15:43.734
- Is there a safe in the house?
- We've never had a safe.

15:43.818 --> 15:44.861
Valuable items?

15:46.946 --> 15:48.114
Where do you store them?

15:48.406 --> 15:50.158
You can see all we have.

15:52.201 --> 15:53.244
So everything is here.

15:54.162 --> 15:55.455
I have nothing to hide.

15:56.622 --> 15:57.457
OK.

15:57.874 --> 15:59.041
Then follow me, please.

16:04.130 --> 16:07.800
I don't know what you want with all this.
The papers are all in order.

16:09.510 --> 16:13.764
In that case... you won't
have any problems.

16:21.272 --> 16:22.148
Nice painting.

16:22.565 --> 16:23.691
It's a photograph.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.984
- Mom?
- Shayenne. Let me talk to Ricky.

17:08.069 --> 17:10.154
- What's going on?
- Now!

17:10.238 --> 17:11.321
I don't get it.

17:11.405 --> 17:13.824
- Pass it to Ricky!
- Mom! Talk to me!

17:14.534 --> 17:16.035
Did something happen?

17:21.958 --> 17:24.544
Talk to me. Did anything bad happen?

17:33.344 --> 17:35.972
OK, Mom. Calm down. I'm
passing the phone. Ricky?

17:36.055 --> 17:39.225
Something's up at my mom's place.
She will only talk to you.

17:40.560 --> 17:41.644
Take it!

17:44.438 --> 17:46.857
- Samira.
- Was it a robbery? Ask her.

17:46.941 --> 17:50.236
They're raiding the place
and asking about the car.

17:50.319 --> 17:52.321
Samira! Calm down.

17:52.405 --> 17:53.948
- Is Paulinho hurt?
- No.

17:54.031 --> 17:55.700
- Is he OK?
- He's fine. Calm down.

17:55.783 --> 17:59.078
- And my dad?
- Go to João Pedro's office.

17:59.537 --> 18:01.372
That is not a crime.

18:01.455 --> 18:02.915
- Tell me, Ricky!
- Calm down!

18:02.999 --> 18:06.085
Clean it up. Take everything from there.

18:06.168 --> 18:08.379
- A new car is no crime!
- Ricky?

19:02.183 --> 19:03.893
JPR ENERGY CONSULTING

19:06.812 --> 19:10.107
With this type of lock, we
would have to knock it down.

19:10.358 --> 19:11.776
He's Petrobrasil's CEO.

19:12.568 --> 19:13.903
We better get the key.

19:36.133 --> 19:38.177
No plea bargain this time.

19:40.262 --> 19:42.682
Maybe this time I won't need one.

19:50.898 --> 19:53.651
Hey! You got JPR?

19:57.446 --> 19:58.280
You did?

19:59.657 --> 20:01.492
Good.

20:04.662 --> 20:07.289
When we have JPR, who's
going to need you?

20:09.667 --> 20:13.671
Maybe this time you'll pay
the years you owe us.

20:50.332 --> 20:52.960
- Don't you answer your phone?
- Did you hear about Ibrahim?

20:53.043 --> 20:55.045
Are you insane? Not here.

20:55.463 --> 20:56.714
Fuck!

20:57.840 --> 21:00.885
If they get to me, I'll
kill that fucking Lebanese.

21:01.302 --> 21:02.678
Did you bring everything?

21:03.304 --> 21:05.681
What a shit-show.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.808
There's not much to do now except wait.

21:09.059 --> 21:11.270
- All here.
- Euro, dollar and real? All mixed.

21:11.353 --> 21:12.396
It's all here.

21:44.512 --> 21:46.138
I got you, JPR!

22:31.642 --> 22:32.518
Vander!

22:41.193 --> 22:42.319
Vander, let's go.

22:44.572 --> 22:47.157
Ricky, tell me the truth.
What happened to my mom?

22:48.826 --> 22:50.536
Nothing happened.

22:50.619 --> 22:52.788
- No?
- It's just work stuff.

22:52.871 --> 22:55.874
Some auditors are demanding documents.

22:55.958 --> 22:57.209
What auditors?

22:59.545 --> 23:01.672
We have to go to your
dad's office right now.

23:01.755 --> 23:04.842
What will I do there?
I'm getting our son.

23:05.884 --> 23:09.513
Honey, I need your help now.

23:10.389 --> 23:11.724
What about Paulinho?

23:12.683 --> 23:14.059
Will come with me?

23:34.705 --> 23:35.789
Mr. João Pedro?

23:42.046 --> 23:43.964
I need your office keys.

23:44.965 --> 23:46.008
Please.

24:01.815 --> 24:03.067
I need you to come with us.

24:10.866 --> 24:13.994
Why can't the deputy come over here?
He'll be welcome.

24:14.078 --> 24:15.371
That's not how it works.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.289
How, then? What does he need to know?

24:17.373 --> 24:19.291
He just wants to ask you a few questions.

24:19.375 --> 24:22.461
Questions about what? The car?
Is that it?

24:22.544 --> 24:24.880
Sir, he'll talk to you
at the superintendency.

24:24.963 --> 24:28.425
Pepê, stay calm. I'll contact Agostini
and he'll sort everything out.

24:29.093 --> 24:31.178
Mr. João Pedro, let's go.

24:31.512 --> 24:32.680
Follow me.

25:38.954 --> 25:40.914
GATE

26:23.415 --> 26:24.416
This way.

26:59.827 --> 27:01.328
Fuck!

27:02.037 --> 27:04.164
Ricky, what do you need from here?

27:12.673 --> 27:15.509
- Come on, Shayenne! Hurry up!
- But what do you need?

27:15.592 --> 27:17.719
Dump in the bag every paper you see.

27:17.803 --> 27:20.305
I'm doing it! Every piece of paper.

27:29.022 --> 27:29.982
That's it!

27:30.691 --> 27:32.067
Let's go. Hurry up.

27:34.444 --> 27:36.572
I even grabbed some old phone bills.

27:36.655 --> 27:38.866
Great. Throw it all inside.

27:41.034 --> 27:41.910
Hurry up!

27:44.663 --> 27:45.706
Come on.

27:46.915 --> 27:47.791
That's it.

27:57.426 --> 27:58.844
Get the elevator.

27:59.344 --> 28:01.013
JPR ENERGY CONSULTING

28:01.138 --> 28:02.431
Be careful, honey.

28:06.351 --> 28:07.561
Calm down, Ricky.

28:10.063 --> 28:10.981
Done.

28:14.735 --> 28:15.569
Let's go.

28:32.920 --> 28:36.423
Mr. João Pedro, as
Petrobrasil's supply CEO,

28:36.506 --> 28:39.760
are you aware of the existence
of a money laundering scheme

28:40.260 --> 28:44.431
run by Roberto Ibrahim and involving
the corruption of public officers?

28:46.183 --> 28:47.267
No.

28:48.435 --> 28:53.649
Are you aware of a pool of
contractors enjoying privileges

28:53.899 --> 28:56.818
in bids for construction work
at Antônio & Lima's refinery?

28:58.195 --> 28:59.363
No.

29:00.822 --> 29:02.950
Mr. João Pedro, have you
ever been arrested?

29:05.619 --> 29:06.703
Never.

29:37.067 --> 29:37.901
Is that it?

29:41.822 --> 29:43.615
Can I go home now?

29:44.866 --> 29:46.743
Sure. You're free to go.

29:58.672 --> 30:02.301
What the fuck was that operation
against a Petrobrasil CEO?

30:02.384 --> 30:05.178
- How was I not aware of it?
- I wasn't aware of it either.

30:05.512 --> 30:08.307
Verena's fucking cell phone
goes straight to voicemail.

30:08.515 --> 30:11.518
- What's wrong with her?
- She's probably flying back.

30:11.685 --> 30:14.479
The unit got to JPR's Office
and there was nothing there.

30:15.063 --> 30:18.317
Serves them right! Of course they
wouldn't find anything there.

30:18.400 --> 30:20.902
That's not how things work, damn it!

30:21.611 --> 30:23.697
She didn't inform me about this.

30:23.780 --> 30:25.032
She made it all up.

30:26.408 --> 30:27.617
A fucking disgrace.

30:28.410 --> 30:30.620
Now it's on her to explain
this fucking mess.

30:31.538 --> 30:33.915
- Want a glass of water, boss?
- Please. No ice.

30:34.458 --> 30:35.459
Excuse me.

30:39.212 --> 30:40.255
Leave it here.

30:41.923 --> 30:45.594
There are more boxes coming in.
You can put them on the shelves.

30:45.969 --> 30:48.180
Leave them by those bags.

30:48.597 --> 30:49.806
There, with him.

30:50.223 --> 30:51.850
Leave them by those bags.

30:54.186 --> 30:55.062
Thank you.

30:58.648 --> 31:01.651
Good afternoon, everyone. Well done.

31:01.735 --> 31:03.945
Three currency dealers
and a nice, big haul.

31:04.029 --> 31:07.491
Good work, China. Everything
worked out in the end.

31:07.741 --> 31:09.659
I'm proud of you. Congratulations.

31:09.826 --> 31:12.704
Now I need a word with
Deputy Verena in private.

31:16.792 --> 31:17.626
Please.

31:27.677 --> 31:29.137
You too, Vander.

31:37.896 --> 31:40.857
- You don't have custody.
- The operation was authorized.

31:40.941 --> 31:44.069
You dragged João Pedro Rangel to
testify and you have nothing on him.

31:44.152 --> 31:45.404
I will have, soon.

31:46.446 --> 31:49.741
You made this warrant up
and acted behind my back.

31:50.242 --> 31:52.327
- You messed up. Big time.
- I don't think so.

31:52.411 --> 31:53.912
I'm removing you from the case.

31:53.995 --> 31:56.373
You're like Ruffo and
you'll end up the same way.

31:56.456 --> 31:58.250
See all the documents we seized?

31:58.333 --> 32:01.461
I took a look at it. It's scary.

32:01.878 --> 32:07.092
If you really do remove me, you
had better get rid of all that.

32:07.217 --> 32:09.010
Or it could be embarrassing for you.

32:10.220 --> 32:11.138
Excuse me.

32:20.981 --> 32:22.399
Relax, old man.

32:27.070 --> 32:29.406
Now they will have nothing against us.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.835
I believe in our justice system.

33:29.007 --> 33:30.717
Better than your hotel room.

33:52.531 --> 33:55.242
Ibra! You here?

34:42.956 --> 34:47.127
Vander! Why didn't they leave
a guard at the office?

34:47.377 --> 34:50.213
That's unacceptable. Beyond incompetent.

34:50.297 --> 34:52.132
- They couldn't do both.
- What?

34:52.257 --> 34:55.385
It was either one or the other!
I went to the target's house.

34:55.467 --> 34:58.138
Stayed with JPR and sent the
Rio agents to his office.

34:58.555 --> 35:00.140
How was I supposed to know?

35:00.223 --> 35:02.392
Do you know how much
evidence they had there?

35:02.809 --> 35:04.269
- Yes.
- No, you don't.

35:06.354 --> 35:07.689
We still have the Evoque.

35:10.900 --> 35:11.901
It's not enough.

35:13.278 --> 35:15.947
I should have known something
was off about Guilhome.

35:16.615 --> 35:19.117
Every time there was a crisis
he took a bathroom break.

35:19.826 --> 35:21.620
As if he had urinary incontinence.

35:33.673 --> 35:34.758
What now?

35:35.925 --> 35:38.261
How can I go after JPR?

35:40.972 --> 35:43.808
Did you look at the
building's security cameras?

35:45.393 --> 35:47.020
But how could I complain?

35:48.355 --> 35:50.940
He was too good to be true.

35:56.196 --> 35:59.616
Not only did he organize Ibrahim's
accounting in two days,

36:00.033 --> 36:02.535
he also figured out JPR's case.

36:03.203 --> 36:05.121
How could I mistrust a guy like that?

36:06.122 --> 36:07.165
Here.

36:07.791 --> 36:10.168
See? His daughter and her husband.

36:11.961 --> 36:14.673
What does JPR have to hide?

36:18.760 --> 36:21.137
Two suitcases and a few bags.

36:22.097 --> 36:22.931
Well done.
