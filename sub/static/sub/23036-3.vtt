00:06.873 --> 00:08.908
[growling]

00:11.011 --> 00:12.278
[in Chinese] I am Yunpeng Zhang.

00:12.345 --> 00:13.713
After I discovered parkour,

00:13.780 --> 00:15.315
I changed.

00:16.583 --> 00:18.852
Joining this competition

00:18.918 --> 00:21.287
and competing with people
from five countries,

00:22.055 --> 00:24.858
I want the other contestants to know...

00:26.860 --> 00:29.362
that the Chinese team is powerful.

00:35.268 --> 00:37.270

00:47.814 --> 00:50.016
[cheering]

00:54.320 --> 00:56.056
[Tiki] Look at those chompers!

00:56.122 --> 00:58.024
Those are some nasty-looking teeth!

00:58.425 --> 01:01.895
Hello, everyone. I'm Tiki Barber,
and with me is Chris Distefano.

01:01.961 --> 01:04.431
Right now, 12 new competitors,
gearing up

01:04.497 --> 01:07.867
to take a shot at tonight's $10,000 prize.

01:07.934 --> 01:11.538
So far, two star athletes -
one from each episode -

01:11.604 --> 01:15.175
have advanced to compete
for the title of Ultimate Beastmaster.

01:15.241 --> 01:17.043
Tonight, who will be number three?

01:17.343 --> 01:18.645
[Chris] Before we get them out,

01:18.711 --> 01:21.714
let's take a look at both athletes
representing the US tonight.

01:21.781 --> 01:24.984
One's an adrenaline junkie,
the other likes to get funky!

01:25.051 --> 01:26.853
OCR star, Kyle Soderman,

01:26.920 --> 01:28.888
and professional dancer, Jeremey Adam Rey.

01:29.389 --> 01:32.826
[Tiki] Kyle's the number one ranked
obstacle course racer in the Midwest.

01:33.359 --> 01:36.096
Now, he's hoping to shine
on a global stage.

01:36.162 --> 01:39.666
Obstacle courses
are my absolute specialty.

01:39.732 --> 01:40.900
[woman] Go, Kyle!

01:40.967 --> 01:43.736
[Kyle] I compete all over the nation,
traveling, competing

01:43.803 --> 01:48.508
and I really do pretty much podium
every single competition that I go to.

01:48.575 --> 01:52.412
And that's why this Beast,
it's going to be nothing for me.

01:52.479 --> 01:56.316
[Tiki] Jeremey is a pro dancer,
and even performed with J.Lo.

01:56.382 --> 01:58.785
Now, he's hoping to bust a move
on the Beast.

01:58.852 --> 02:01.421
[Jeremey] I've been doing
professional dancing since I was eight.

02:01.488 --> 02:06.059
It's also opened me to doing
other physical arts -

02:06.126 --> 02:08.695
parkour, acrobatics and circus.

02:09.762 --> 02:12.132
[Tiki] Nobody's doubting our squad.
Nobody.

02:12.632 --> 02:14.234
Let's kick it off!

02:14.300 --> 02:16.603
Level 1 starts right now.

02:20.406 --> 02:21.808
It's about to get real!

02:22.509 --> 02:26.479
It's time for our first athlete.
The Beast brings the pain.

02:26.880 --> 02:27.780
He cures it.

02:27.847 --> 02:32.118
From India, ER doctor and parkour guru,
Rishi Prasad.

02:35.321 --> 02:37.690
[in Hindi] In India,
I work as a doctor in the ER.

02:38.892 --> 02:42.795
To manage stress levels,
usually, I do parkour training.

02:42.862 --> 02:46.366
In parkour training,
you get into such a zone

02:46.432 --> 02:49.335
that you forget
the problems of the whole day.

02:49.402 --> 02:51.271
[in English] I'm here representing India

02:51.337 --> 02:54.674
in a competition that India
is still pretty new at.

02:54.741 --> 02:59.012
I think the public will enjoy this,
and I think they will root for us.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.348
[in Hindi] Victory!

03:02.415 --> 03:04.284
Victory to India!

03:04.350 --> 03:07.453
[Tiki] You have to think, with Rishi's
experience, both as an ER doctor

03:07.520 --> 03:08.655
and a parkour expert,

03:08.988 --> 03:11.624
that he's gonna attack this thing
with surgical precision.

03:12.725 --> 03:15.228
All right, these Grinder things, man,
they scare me.

03:15.295 --> 03:16.563
[Chris] That's five points.

03:16.629 --> 03:19.899
[Tiki] But they don't turn. That's good.
All he's gotta do is land the jump.

03:22.135 --> 03:23.536
-[Chris] Wow.
-[Tiki] He landed it.

03:25.171 --> 03:28.041
-[Chris] The Beast was built by aliens.
-[Tiki] Is that correct?

03:28.107 --> 03:29.742
-[Chris] That is.
-[Tiki] Who told you?

03:29.809 --> 03:32.478
[Chris] The guy from that show,
Ancient Aliens.

03:32.545 --> 03:33.479
[Tiki laughs]

03:34.814 --> 03:35.682
[chanting] India!

03:36.416 --> 03:38.184
[Sarah-Jane in English]
Onto the Faceplant.

03:38.251 --> 03:40.019
You need a lot of core strength.

03:40.086 --> 03:43.356
You need to hold on with your hands.
It moves fast towards the water.

03:43.423 --> 03:45.124
[Sarah-Jane] See the concentration.

03:45.191 --> 03:49.195
[Tiki] Look at his eyes!
I don't know if that's fear or intensity.

03:51.264 --> 03:53.066
[Chris] Look at that grip! Oh, my God!

03:53.132 --> 03:55.201
Remind me to never get a physical
from that guy!

03:55.268 --> 03:58.371
[Tiki] But now he's got to swing himself
back onto the Energy Coils.

03:58.438 --> 04:01.074
-There you go. Five more points for Rishi!
-India...

04:01.140 --> 04:02.675
is opening it up.

04:02.742 --> 04:05.111
Rishi! Rishi!

04:06.012 --> 04:08.481
[Chris] This is where it gets hard.
This is not an easy jump.

04:08.548 --> 04:09.749
[Tiki] He can't think here.

04:09.816 --> 04:13.620
He's got to forget the doctor side
and trust his primal parkour instinct.

04:14.120 --> 04:15.154
[Tiki and Chris] Oh, no!

04:15.788 --> 04:16.889
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

04:16.956 --> 04:19.091
-[in English] That's a good one.
-[Chris] He's got it.

04:19.158 --> 04:21.127
-[Sarah-Jane] Good job!
-[Vidyut] That's good!

04:22.829 --> 04:24.831
[audience cheering]

04:27.066 --> 04:28.167
[Chris and Tiki] Oh!

04:28.935 --> 04:30.336
[Chris] Into the blood!

04:30.737 --> 04:31.571
[groans]

04:32.639 --> 04:35.241
-[Chris] That's a nice leadoff.
-[Tiki] Forty points for Rishi.

04:35.308 --> 04:37.243
-Let's see what happens.
-[Chris] Way to go.

04:37.310 --> 04:39.212
You're an Indian Rickey Henderson.

04:39.279 --> 04:43.850
[Tiki] I think the issue there was
he didn't let go before he started to run.

04:43.916 --> 04:46.686
[Chris] No. I think he came up
a little short, and he bounced off.

04:46.753 --> 04:48.955
-That's what happened.
-[Tiki] Exactly what happened.

04:49.022 --> 04:51.090
I've gotta tell you,
it's hard to go first.

04:51.157 --> 04:53.126
[Chris] Absolutely.
There's got to be nerves.

04:53.860 --> 04:56.663
I'm really disappointed.
I really thought I had this.

04:57.263 --> 05:00.166
I don't want to make
anyone else fall out first,

05:00.233 --> 05:03.036
but if that happens, I'd be excited.

05:04.404 --> 05:06.673
[Tiki] For our first competitor
from team USA,

05:06.739 --> 05:09.275
professional dancer Jeremey Adam

05:09.342 --> 05:13.046
"O Ray, can you see,"
bring it home for the US?

05:14.180 --> 05:15.381
[car horns honking]

05:15.448 --> 05:17.250
[Jeremey] Dancing has done a lot for me.

05:17.317 --> 05:20.420
I've danced at Carnegie Hall
for the Ambassador of Brazil.

05:20.486 --> 05:25.325
When I was 16, I danced right behind
Jennifer Lopez as a backup dancer.

05:25.391 --> 05:27.427
It was definitely like an escape for me.

05:28.561 --> 05:31.631
Growing up, my father
was very abusive towards my mother.

05:31.698 --> 05:35.935
My mom took me and my older sister
and my younger sister,

05:36.002 --> 05:37.370
got our stuff, and we left.

05:37.670 --> 05:40.740
We were just shelter hopping,
from shelter to shelter.

05:40.807 --> 05:42.608
I had to grow up really fast.

05:42.675 --> 05:44.544
[Latin music playing]

05:44.610 --> 05:47.347
I found that dance
was a huge escape for me

05:47.413 --> 05:50.683
from being beaten up
and shelters and stuff.

05:50.750 --> 05:52.018
I felt a certain acceptance.

05:52.385 --> 05:54.287
I'm the Ultimate Beastmaster.

05:54.587 --> 05:57.423
I'm gonna conquer this obstacle
like everything else in my life.

05:59.692 --> 06:02.328
[Tiki] He's a dancer.
This guy's got some moves.

06:02.395 --> 06:05.231
-He's doing the robot dance.
-He's relaxing his muscles.

06:05.865 --> 06:08.701
Hey, yours is different.
Yours looks like you're drunk.

06:08.768 --> 06:10.269
[horn sounds]

06:11.104 --> 06:14.107
-No problem. Two-stepped through it.
-Didn't have to worry about the chain.

06:16.843 --> 06:18.010
[Tiki] On to Grinder.

06:18.077 --> 06:20.113
-He's a parkour kid as well, so...
-[Chris] Yes.

06:20.346 --> 06:21.981
This should be no problem for him.

06:26.819 --> 06:27.954
[Tiki] Strong legs.

06:28.020 --> 06:30.356
Strong legs to do a standing broad jump.

06:30.423 --> 06:32.592
-Takes a lot of strong legs.
-[Chris] Powerful.

06:33.092 --> 06:34.260
Look at that. Jeremey!

06:34.327 --> 06:35.495
[Chris] Here we go.

06:35.561 --> 06:36.529
[Tiki] So far, so good.

06:36.596 --> 06:38.831
[Chris] This is...
He's making it look easy right now.

06:38.898 --> 06:41.601
[Tiki] You know what?
He's conserving energy.

06:41.667 --> 06:43.302
-[Chris] 100%
-[Tiki] I love this.

06:43.369 --> 06:45.271
[chanting] Oossaa! Oossaa!

06:47.840 --> 06:49.609
[Chris] Okay, here we go. Here we go.

06:50.176 --> 06:51.711
-You got this!
-[Tiki] Here we go.

06:51.778 --> 06:54.113
-Bend those knees!
-[Chris] Bend those knees, brother.

06:55.615 --> 06:57.717
-Get onto that coil.
-[Chris] On the coil, easy.

06:57.784 --> 06:58.785
No problem.

06:59.852 --> 07:01.621
[Tiki] Now, we're onto the Energy Coils.

07:01.988 --> 07:04.524
The Point Thruster
gives you ten extra points.

07:04.590 --> 07:06.926
-Would you go for the points?
-I'm always going for points!

07:06.993 --> 07:07.994
You're selfish!

07:08.060 --> 07:09.862
[Tiki laughs]

07:10.363 --> 07:11.931
-Oh!
-[Chris whoops]

07:11.998 --> 07:13.633
[Chris] That's how you do it, brother!

07:14.934 --> 07:16.135
Ten more points.

07:16.202 --> 07:17.236
Wow!

07:17.303 --> 07:19.172
-[Tiki] I see you!
-I see you, brother.

07:19.238 --> 07:21.007
Here's the problem, he's gotta go back...

07:21.741 --> 07:24.677
the way he just came
in order to go forward.

07:25.044 --> 07:27.680
[Chris groans] Oh! Oh, no!

07:28.514 --> 07:30.216
It did not pay off, folks.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.084
You shouldn't have done that!

07:32.385 --> 07:35.188
[Chris] Listen, we had a slip-up, okay?

07:35.588 --> 07:37.890
[Tiki] Sometimes,
when you have to make a long leap,

07:37.957 --> 07:40.493
it's almost better
to shorten your strides.

07:40.560 --> 07:42.228
Power comes from short strides.

07:42.295 --> 07:45.865
Long strides like that
actually put the brakes on when you jump.

07:45.932 --> 07:47.433
I could have done better.

07:47.500 --> 07:51.270
I'm hard on myself, but I have
to be grateful for what I did so far.

07:51.704 --> 07:53.039
I came a long way, I believe.

07:53.105 --> 07:56.709
I think my mom would be very pleased
that I at least got to these.

07:58.411 --> 08:00.279
[Tiki] He's gotta be so disappointed.

08:00.346 --> 08:03.049
[Chris] He's still in the lead.
Did two people go? Yes.

08:03.115 --> 08:05.885
But still, he's first out of those two,
so whatever.

08:06.385 --> 08:07.653
[growling]

08:07.720 --> 08:09.989
[Tiki] Our next competitor
took first place

08:10.056 --> 08:12.024
at the World Parkour Championship.

08:12.091 --> 08:14.660
From France, Yoann Leroux.

08:14.727 --> 08:16.896
[Chris] They call this kid
"Yoann Le-Kanga-Roux."

08:16.963 --> 08:18.698
Wait till you see him jump.

08:20.066 --> 08:21.968
Well, you talk about determination.

08:22.034 --> 08:22.969
At age 18,

08:23.035 --> 08:26.739
he went to China and studied with
Shaolin monks to try to find his identity.

08:29.408 --> 08:31.177
[Tiki] Look at this. Confidence, speed...

08:31.244 --> 08:33.044
-This is freerunning.
-[Chris] This is it.

08:33.111 --> 08:35.815
-That's freerunning.
-[Tiki] Speed, confidence, explosion.

08:36.982 --> 08:41.687
This Faceplant has not proven
to be too difficult, but you never know.

08:42.922 --> 08:45.224
[Chris] You never know.
The Faceplant can get you.

08:45.291 --> 08:47.126
[Tiki] He's smiling, man.
He's loving this.

08:47.193 --> 08:48.461
Yeah. He's loving this.

08:48.961 --> 08:50.329
Wow!

08:50.730 --> 08:52.532
You're the best, Yoann!

08:52.598 --> 08:55.201
[Tiki] You can see how fast
he sailed through the Energy Coil.

08:55.268 --> 08:59.138
That must be his experience
jumping rooftop to rooftop in Paris.

08:59.205 --> 09:01.807
[Chris] He wants those points.
He's gonna get the bonus points.

09:01.874 --> 09:03.676
[Tiki] He's gonna go
for the Thruster here.

09:03.743 --> 09:06.212
I think we'll know right away--
He's flat jumping this.

09:06.279 --> 09:08.481
This kid's
got some spring in his legs, man.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.182
He's got some spring in his leg.

09:10.249 --> 09:12.585
-Wow, this kid is good.
-[Chris] He got it with his foot.

09:13.419 --> 09:15.855
Oh, showing off with the leg kick!

09:15.922 --> 09:17.623
Taekwondo! Yeah!

09:17.690 --> 09:18.758
So precise!

09:18.824 --> 09:20.059
[Chris] Here's the question -

09:20.126 --> 09:22.228
can he do what Jeremey Adam Rey could not

09:22.295 --> 09:25.097
and successfully get back
to that original Energy Coil?

09:25.164 --> 09:26.332
[Chris and Tiki groan]

09:26.399 --> 09:28.167
Oh, goodness!

09:28.234 --> 09:29.669
Oh, no!

09:29.735 --> 09:33.072
Yes! Yes! Yes!

09:33.139 --> 09:36.075
[Chris] Same problem Jeremey had.

09:36.142 --> 09:37.577
They should watch and learn.

09:37.944 --> 09:39.078
[Tiki] Here's the replay.

09:39.879 --> 09:41.247
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay!

09:41.314 --> 09:43.316
Yoann! Well done.

09:43.382 --> 09:46.385
-[in English] I think he's number one.
-We're tied. France and US tie.

09:46.452 --> 09:48.421
[in English] He's number one with USA,
guys.

09:48.854 --> 09:51.223
[Tiki] Yoann and Jeremey
have set the pace.

09:51.557 --> 09:54.827
Let's check out the highlights
from more world-class competitors

09:54.894 --> 09:56.529
who hoped to conquer the Beast.

09:57.496 --> 09:58.731
Representing France...

09:58.798 --> 10:00.099
[Tiki] Representing France,

10:00.166 --> 10:03.769
Mathilde Becerra, a world champion
rock climber from Toulouse,

10:03.836 --> 10:06.572
who thrives on competition
and testing her limits.

10:06.639 --> 10:10.142
This is the seventh ranked rock climber
in the world.

10:11.377 --> 10:13.379
[both] Oh, no!

10:13.446 --> 10:15.648
[Tiki] The Grinder was tough
for our competitors.

10:15.715 --> 10:18.150
Climber Feng Wan of Guangzhou

10:18.217 --> 10:21.120
and fitness guru Urmi Kothari of Mumbai

10:21.187 --> 10:23.623
both took their shot of glory
against the Beast.

10:23.689 --> 10:25.591
-You can do it!
-Jump across!

10:26.158 --> 10:28.928
[Tiki] But they were all
eaten up by the Grinder.

10:29.328 --> 10:32.131
The Beast was having its way
with these athletes early on.

10:32.198 --> 10:34.634
[in Italian] Come on! Italy will win!
We can make it!

10:34.700 --> 10:38.137
[Tiki] Italy's Tiziano Battista
hoped to break the Grinder curse.

10:38.204 --> 10:40.139
[Chris] He jumps and he lands it!

10:40.206 --> 10:42.675
[Tiki] Tiziano barely survived the Grinder

10:42.742 --> 10:44.110
and made the jump to Faceplant.

10:44.176 --> 10:48.881
-Tiziano! Tiziano! Tiziano! Tiziano!
-[cheers]

10:49.482 --> 10:52.084
[Tiki] But on the Energy Coils,
he crashed and burned.

10:52.151 --> 10:54.253
Oh, what happened? He can't?

10:54.320 --> 10:57.323
Right in the blood or,
as he calls it, the sauce.

10:57.390 --> 10:58.491
[chanting] España!

10:58.557 --> 11:02.228
[Chris] Here comes a Spanish triathlete -
Aitor Dominguez.

11:03.029 --> 11:06.899
[Tiki] Aitor soared through Grinder
and Faceplant like a Spanish fly.

11:06.966 --> 11:09.335
Oh, almost lost it there. Hold on!

11:09.402 --> 11:12.438
♪ Aitor, Aitor, Aitor! ♪

11:13.806 --> 11:15.675
[Tiki and Spanish hosts] Oh!

11:15.741 --> 11:18.978
[Tiki] But his second jump
on the Energy Coils was "no bueno."

11:19.045 --> 11:21.681
Oh, what a shame! [groans]

11:22.181 --> 11:24.684
[Chris, in Spanish] Spain! What happened?

11:24.750 --> 11:26.585
[in English] Let's check the leaderboard.

11:26.652 --> 11:30.122
Right now, Yoann Leroux of France
and Jeremey Adam Rey of the US

11:30.189 --> 11:32.191
are on top with 50 points each.

11:32.925 --> 11:37.430
Only eight of the top 12
will move on to Level 2.

11:37.496 --> 11:40.900
[Tiki] Chris, that means that Indian
kettlebell champ Urmi Kothari of India

11:40.966 --> 11:44.136
is squarely on the bubble
and in danger of being eliminated.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.707
[Chris] Next up,
we have an OCR star from the USA -

11:47.773 --> 11:50.342
extreme sports athlete Kyle Soderman.

11:52.745 --> 11:54.880
This is my mother, Lori Soderman.

11:55.347 --> 11:58.884
My mom did raise both me and my brothers,
pretty much on her own.

11:58.951 --> 12:01.921
I honestly have no idea how she did it.

12:01.987 --> 12:04.156
I mean, she's running her own business,

12:04.223 --> 12:07.059
she's raising me
and my two older brothers,

12:07.126 --> 12:09.762
and we weren't calm children whatsoever.

12:10.996 --> 12:14.066
We were all into this action
and extreme sports.

12:15.301 --> 12:18.404
My mom absolutely despises
all the sports that I do.

12:19.305 --> 12:21.674
Oh, my God! Kyle!

12:21.741 --> 12:25.144
She points at her head
and shows me all of her gray hairs

12:25.211 --> 12:27.413
and she's like, "You gave me that one."

12:27.480 --> 12:31.484
I'm like, "I'm sorry, but I absolutely
love doing it. It's so much fun for me."

12:31.884 --> 12:33.686
This is my training ground.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.222
Growing up, my brothers
were always bettering me,

12:36.288 --> 12:37.556
always pushing me,

12:37.623 --> 12:41.127
and that's where I derive
my huge competitive feelings.

12:41.193 --> 12:44.497
And really, everything I do,
I'm always pushing limits.

12:44.563 --> 12:46.365
I'm always trying to get better.

12:46.432 --> 12:47.433
I'm here to win.

12:49.235 --> 12:50.669
[Tiki] Now, back on Faceplant,

12:50.736 --> 12:54.740
Kyle Soderman is bracing himself
and getting ready to make a big jump.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.276
Kyle looks very confident here.

12:59.145 --> 13:00.212
[Chris] Here we go, Kyle.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.449
-Look at that! That was...
-[Tiki] Easily! Easily!

13:03.516 --> 13:05.951
-[Chris] He didn't expect that.
-[Tiki] Easily through.

13:06.018 --> 13:10.589
Now, it looks like Kyle is thinking
of the same philosophy as Jeremey.

13:10.656 --> 13:14.093
[Chris] Kyle, watch and learn.
Nobody's been able to get back.

13:14.560 --> 13:16.762
You can get there, but can you get back?

13:17.663 --> 13:19.632
-Kyle, please don't do it.
-[Tiki and Chris sigh]

13:19.698 --> 13:21.600
-Getting over is easy.
-He did it.

13:21.834 --> 13:22.968
-All right.
-[Tiki] Kick it.

13:23.035 --> 13:24.436
Here we go. okay, Kyle.

13:24.503 --> 13:26.572
[both] Don't think about it! Just go!

13:26.639 --> 13:27.907
-Just go, Kyle!
-Just go!

13:30.142 --> 13:32.144
Oh, he made it! He made it!

13:32.211 --> 13:34.113
He made it! Kyle made it!

13:39.451 --> 13:41.387
[Chris] Wow, okay, Kyle's in first place.

13:41.453 --> 13:43.222
-He took the lead.
-[Tiki] Kyle is in first.

13:43.289 --> 13:45.791
[Chris] Now we have the top two
coming from the US.

13:49.528 --> 13:50.529
Yes!

13:59.238 --> 14:00.472
[Tiki] Now these things roll.

14:00.539 --> 14:01.941
-[Chris] Okay.
-[Tiki] These roll.

14:02.007 --> 14:03.108
-Here we go.
-[Chris] Oh.

14:03.442 --> 14:04.910
[Tiki] Easily to the second one.

14:05.578 --> 14:08.113
He just hit another Thruster
with his foot.

14:08.881 --> 14:11.717
-He's racking up the points.
-[Chris] No one's gonna beat Kyle.

14:11.784 --> 14:13.652
[Tiki]
He's almost guaranteed to get through

14:14.320 --> 14:15.554
to the second round.

14:15.621 --> 14:16.755
[Chris] He is guaranteed.

14:16.822 --> 14:18.624
[Tiki] Let's see what philosophy he'll use

14:18.691 --> 14:21.360
through the rest of these Dead Bolts.

14:21.427 --> 14:23.295
[Chris] I don't know
what philosophy this is.

14:23.362 --> 14:24.630
-This is useless.
-[Tiki] God!

14:24.697 --> 14:27.800
-He's Gumby over here.
-[Chris] He's using all his appendages.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.568
[Tiki] This is gonna take a jump. Oh!

14:29.635 --> 14:32.238
-He got it! He held it!
-[Chris] He's got the crowd behind him.

14:32.304 --> 14:35.074
[Tiki] We're going to get
the first man to the Mag Wall.

14:36.208 --> 14:38.544
-[Chris] He's on the Mag Wall!
-He's got to move quickly.

14:44.049 --> 14:45.217
[Tiki] He's racking up points.

14:45.284 --> 14:47.753
Every time he goes past
one of those orange lines,

14:47.820 --> 14:49.521
he racks up five more points.

14:49.588 --> 14:52.291
[Chris] But he does not know
which mag is going to fall.

14:52.358 --> 14:54.660
[Tiki] They are coming off.
He got the Point Thruster.

14:54.727 --> 14:58.831
So he's hit all three on the first stage
of the Beastmaster.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.065
Come on, Kyle!

15:00.132 --> 15:01.533
[Chris] This kid's got 1000 points.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.802
[Tiki] Is he gonna do it?

15:03.869 --> 15:05.938
-You've got to jump!
-[Chris] Will he get to the...

15:07.239 --> 15:08.474
[commentators groan]

15:11.043 --> 15:12.244
[Tiki] That looked painful.

15:12.511 --> 15:14.146
-[Chris] So close.
-[Tiki] He's okay.

15:14.213 --> 15:18.150
The issue was, as he tried to jump off
that Mag Wall, he was leaning back.

15:18.217 --> 15:20.419
So he never had the right angle
to land forward

15:20.486 --> 15:23.322
or get his body's momentum
going forward.

15:23.589 --> 15:24.523
I feel fantastic.

15:24.590 --> 15:27.726
I knew I was gonna get this far.
I wish I would have finished it.

15:27.793 --> 15:30.596
That's what happens.
You never know what's gonna go on.

15:30.663 --> 15:33.032
Next time,
I'm getting all the way through Level 2.

15:33.098 --> 15:37.503
[Chris] Okay, so Kyle Soderman
in first place with 115 points.

15:37.569 --> 15:39.138
USA, one and two.

15:39.204 --> 15:40.873
-Oossaa!
-Oossaa!

15:41.307 --> 15:43.809
[Tiki] Urmi has now
officially been eliminated.

15:43.876 --> 15:46.078
Urmi is out.

15:46.445 --> 15:49.381
[Tiki] There are three athletes
left to run Level 1.

15:50.049 --> 15:53.052
This is China versus China.

15:53.118 --> 15:58.691
Because if Yunpeng gets past the second
Grinder, he's going to knock out Feng.

15:58.757 --> 16:00.459
[Chris] He'll knock out
his countrywoman.

16:00.526 --> 16:01.393
[Tiki] Yes.

16:04.763 --> 16:06.799
He moved through.
He almost overran it...

16:07.099 --> 16:08.067
[Chris] He's good.

16:08.133 --> 16:11.470
[Tiki] ...and hit the mat and
knocked himself out before he got on it.

16:12.938 --> 16:14.940
[audience applauds]

16:21.580 --> 16:24.216
Feng Wan is eliminated.

16:24.817 --> 16:27.052
-[Chris] She's gone.
-[Tiki] She's officially out. Yes.

16:27.119 --> 16:29.655
[Chris] Yunpeng holds a Guinness Book
World Record in parkour.

16:29.722 --> 16:32.891
So those leaps?
Nothing his quads and glutes can't handle.

16:32.958 --> 16:33.959
Yunpeng.

16:34.026 --> 16:34.927
You can do it!

16:34.994 --> 16:37.563
[Tiki] Through the Grinder.
Here we go with the Faceplant.

16:38.464 --> 16:40.165
I gotta tell you, he's 5'7",

16:40.232 --> 16:45.137
and we've seen a couple of our athletes
try to go for those Point Thrusters.

16:45.204 --> 16:47.539
I think the shorter athletes
are gonna have trouble.

16:49.408 --> 16:50.943
-[exclaims]
-[whoops]

16:51.010 --> 16:53.679
He did it!

16:54.446 --> 16:57.616
[chanting] Clear the level!
Clear the level!

16:58.450 --> 17:00.052
[Tiki] Yunpeng is on the Energy Coils.

17:00.119 --> 17:02.187
One jump-- Oh! Oh!

17:02.254 --> 17:03.589
-He tried it.
-[Chris] Yunpeng!

17:03.655 --> 17:05.656
[groaning]

17:08.193 --> 17:11.930
[Tiki] I tell you, you get greedy.
You get greedy with the Thruster.

17:11.997 --> 17:15.034
Just couldn't get...
Too much of a vertical leap.

17:15.099 --> 17:19.003
-And not a forward leap.
-[Chris] The great fall of China.

17:19.805 --> 17:22.340
We are the best.
One of us can complete this.

17:27.445 --> 17:30.916
[Tiki] Mathilde from France
is now on the bubble.

17:31.483 --> 17:34.887
Could Lisa Sarcinelli from Italy
knock her out?

17:37.723 --> 17:41.126
[Lisa in Italian] I came across parkour
on the internet,

17:41.193 --> 17:42.661
and it was love at first sight.

17:42.728 --> 17:45.898
After three, four years,

17:46.465 --> 17:49.935
I decided to open a parkour gym
in my area.

17:50.002 --> 17:51.437
Like this.

17:52.504 --> 17:54.573
I started with five students

17:54.640 --> 17:56.308
and today,

17:56.375 --> 17:58.911
I finally have my own center.

17:58.977 --> 18:01.346
The class that makes me the happiest

18:01.413 --> 18:03.615
is the one with my super munchkins.

18:03.682 --> 18:05.918
They range from five to eight years old.

18:05.984 --> 18:08.887
There are about a dozen children.

18:08.954 --> 18:10.522
All in all, they have, like...

18:10.589 --> 18:12.591
20 teeth! [laughs]

18:12.658 --> 18:14.093
Bye!

18:14.159 --> 18:15.727
[man] Good luck, Lisa!

18:16.328 --> 18:18.764
[Lisa] They will be my first supporters!

18:18.831 --> 18:21.967
They believe in me
more than I do myself.

18:23.602 --> 18:26.572
[in English] We might go out
because of you.

18:26.972 --> 18:29.041
-She is a parkour enthusiast.
-Eh? No!

18:29.108 --> 18:32.911
-The French are saying no!
-Don't listen to them, they're bad luck.

18:32.978 --> 18:35.314
Let's shut the door!

18:35.781 --> 18:37.349
[Chris] Lisa Sarcinelli.

18:37.616 --> 18:42.321
-[Tiki] You said that very Italian.
-[Chris] I got the last name "Distefano."

18:42.888 --> 18:43.989
All right, Lisa.

18:44.256 --> 18:48.026
[Tiki] She might have some of the same
issues our earlier female competitors had

18:48.093 --> 18:50.129
because she's only 5'1".

18:50.596 --> 18:51.530
[Chris] Fun fact -

18:51.597 --> 18:54.566
she left home after high school
with nothing more than a backpack

18:54.633 --> 18:56.502
because she wanted to be independent.

18:56.568 --> 18:58.837
I did the same,
but it's 'cause I failed chemistry.

19:00.005 --> 19:01.073
Come on, Lisa!

19:01.573 --> 19:03.609
-Yes!
-Great!

19:04.109 --> 19:04.977
Yes!

19:05.644 --> 19:08.514
[Chris] First female to connect on that!

19:09.648 --> 19:12.151
[Tiki] Mathilde is now eliminated.

19:12.918 --> 19:15.821
First female to get past the first Grinder
onto the second.

19:15.888 --> 19:17.789
This should be a little easier for her.

19:19.825 --> 19:22.261
There's a couple of ways
to get momentum, Chris.

19:22.327 --> 19:24.096
One way is to use your arms.

19:24.429 --> 19:26.832
You see how she's thrusting her arms?

19:29.635 --> 19:31.737
You have every reason to smile!

19:31.803 --> 19:33.705
You're great!

19:33.772 --> 19:35.674
Francesco and Bianca are...

19:35.741 --> 19:37.276
The Italian people are going crazy.

19:37.342 --> 19:39.878
[Tiki] They're serenading Lisa over here.

19:40.946 --> 19:43.282
Our first female
to make it to the Faceplant.

19:48.487 --> 19:49.688
Oh! Oh, oh!

19:50.088 --> 19:52.424
Go on, Lisa! Pull yourself up!

19:52.491 --> 19:55.394
Pull yourself up!

19:55.460 --> 19:56.762
Don't give up!

19:57.596 --> 20:01.733
-[Tiki] That was damn impressive.
-[Chris] What's she going to do now, Tiki?

20:02.234 --> 20:03.368
What? Wow!

20:03.435 --> 20:06.238
[Tiki] That's a strain on her hamstrings.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.308
-[Chris] She lost a shoe!
-[Tiki] She lost a shoe!

20:09.374 --> 20:11.543
-Way to go, Lisa!
-She lost a shoe.

20:11.610 --> 20:13.779
[Tiki] She's at
a decided disadvantage right now.

20:13.845 --> 20:16.848
Here! I took a shoe off, too!

20:16.915 --> 20:20.652
Francesco has his shoe off too.
That's what that smell is in the booth.

20:22.788 --> 20:24.289
Take off your other shoe!

20:25.524 --> 20:27.526
Okay, throw it into the blood!

20:27.593 --> 20:30.629
[Tiki] I gotta tell you,
I'd almost go barefoot if I was her.

20:30.696 --> 20:33.732
I'd almost go barefoot
as opposed to going in your socks.

20:33.799 --> 20:36.535
You have kids. You know
when kids run around with socks on?

20:36.602 --> 20:38.036
-[Chris] Yeah.
-[Tiki] You worry.

20:38.637 --> 20:41.940
She's really thinking about this.
Maybe overthinking it.

20:44.009 --> 20:45.944
She's fighting her nerves right now.

20:46.511 --> 20:48.747
[Chris] The Italians
with a flare for the dramatic.

20:48.814 --> 20:50.449
They have to do this shoeless now?

20:50.515 --> 20:52.050
[Tiki] She looks beautiful doing it.

20:54.152 --> 20:56.188
Ouch! That hurts! Is she hurt?

20:56.955 --> 20:58.323
No, Lisa!

20:58.824 --> 21:02.761
-[Chris] Ouch! And she has no shoes on.
-[Tiki] But she's got a smile on her face.

21:02.828 --> 21:05.964
[Chris] You may think that that fall
knocked her shoes off, but it didn't.

21:06.031 --> 21:07.532
Very well done.

21:07.599 --> 21:08.467
Well done!

21:08.533 --> 21:10.035
Has she won?

21:10.502 --> 21:12.237
[Tiki] 35 points for Lisa.

21:12.304 --> 21:14.840
[Chris] We should give her
an extra two points for the shoes.

21:14.906 --> 21:17.809
[Tiki] For that and for the re-catch.
She missed it!

21:18.410 --> 21:19.645
That was unbelievable.

21:19.711 --> 21:23.682
[Chris] She showed a lot of strength,
grit, determination...

21:23.749 --> 21:27.052
Watch out for this girl
in the second round. She's getting there.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.687
Ooh! That hurts.

21:28.754 --> 21:29.821
[Lisa] I hit my face.

21:30.355 --> 21:32.991
It wouldn't have made much difference,
anyway.

21:33.058 --> 21:35.427
Those are long jumps.

21:35.494 --> 21:38.297
With or without shoes,
it would have been the same.

21:38.697 --> 21:40.832
[Tiki] I tell you, Chris,
you talk about drama?

21:40.899 --> 21:45.137
This is drama. Lisa just worked herself
into the eighth spot.

21:45.203 --> 21:48.073
So it comes down to our final competitor

21:48.140 --> 21:51.610
to earn that last spot
and move on to Level 2.

21:51.677 --> 21:54.646
He's a paleontologist
and cross-fit-ologist.

21:54.713 --> 21:57.349
-I think that's a word. Cross-fit-ologist?
-Sure.

21:57.416 --> 22:00.385
He's from Spain. It's Francisco Gascó.

22:02.387 --> 22:05.524
[Francisco in Spanish] All my life,
I remember being fascinated by dinosaurs,

22:05.590 --> 22:07.926
paleontology, and nature.

22:07.993 --> 22:12.230
Ever since I was a young boy, I knew that
if I had to devote myself to something,

22:12.297 --> 22:14.232
it would be something related to that.

22:14.299 --> 22:15.701
[woman cheering]

22:15.767 --> 22:19.037
So, I've spent all my life
studying dinosaurs

22:19.104 --> 22:22.174
and they never cease to be
incredible beasts, so...

22:22.808 --> 22:25.110
If I have to face one more... so be it.

22:27.746 --> 22:30.148
-[Tiki] Look at that beard.
-[Chris] Look at those pecks!

22:30.215 --> 22:31.883
Man, this guy's a monster.

22:32.217 --> 22:35.721
If I was gonna put my money
on who's gonna win, it would be him.

22:36.221 --> 22:39.725
-Not that I am. Gambling's wrong, kids.
-[laughs]

22:39.791 --> 22:42.494
Ask my dad. He did five years
in federal prison for it.

22:43.495 --> 22:46.431
[chanting] Paco! Paco!

22:49.267 --> 22:53.805
-[Chris] Oh! Having trouble going up here.
-[Tiki] A bit timid going up Bite Force.

22:53.872 --> 22:55.240
I'm surprised by that.

22:56.274 --> 22:58.710
Maybe he's not as badass as he looks.

22:59.211 --> 23:02.013
-[Chris] He's having trouble here.
-[Tiki] I know. What's going on?

23:02.080 --> 23:04.116
[Chris] He's deceiving.
Looks can be deceiving.

23:04.182 --> 23:07.152
[Tiki] Maybe he went for a run yesterday
and he's got dead legs.

23:07.219 --> 23:10.889
[Chris] What we've been talking about all
night is determination and fearlessness.

23:10.956 --> 23:12.958
-It seems like he has a bit of fear.
-[Tiki] Yeah.

23:13.024 --> 23:14.793
-He's wobbling.
-[Chris] He's nervous.

23:14.860 --> 23:16.061
[Tiki] What's going on here?

23:16.128 --> 23:19.264
The platform is a bit wobbly.
The Grinder is a bit shaky.

23:19.331 --> 23:21.299
Yes, he's trying to regain his balance.

23:23.435 --> 23:25.203
[Chris] Okay, he got it. Barely.

23:25.270 --> 23:26.605
[audience applauds]

23:26.671 --> 23:28.740
[Tiki] I'm not feeling confident
in this man.

23:28.807 --> 23:31.109
[Chris] What is going on? He's timid.

23:32.110 --> 23:36.748
[Tiki] There might be a lacking of
athleticism that's belied by his figure.

23:37.215 --> 23:38.817
He's not confident here.

23:42.721 --> 23:44.523
-[Chris] Oh!
-[Tiki] Oh! Wow!

23:44.589 --> 23:45.824
He comes up short.

23:45.891 --> 23:49.694
-I can't believe it! I can't believe it!
-Oh, come on! [groaning]

23:49.761 --> 23:52.464
[Chris] I did not expect that, folks.

23:52.531 --> 23:53.832
Lisa! Lisa!

23:53.899 --> 23:55.834
-[Chris] Lisa is in.
-[Tiki] She made it.

23:56.301 --> 23:57.903
[Chris] Francisco is out.

24:04.042 --> 24:05.544
Where did the Italians run to?

24:06.311 --> 24:07.379
You've been great!

24:08.380 --> 24:09.514
Let's hug!

24:10.015 --> 24:11.550
And love each other!

24:13.318 --> 24:15.787
[Tiki] Now that's the end of Level 1.

24:15.854 --> 24:20.158
Checking the leaderboard, you can see
Lisa just gets a foot into Level 2.

24:20.225 --> 24:21.693
[Chris] I've got good and bad news.

24:21.760 --> 24:23.929
The good news is, both Americans advanced.

24:23.995 --> 24:26.698
The bad news is,
the man bun is making a comeback.

24:31.636 --> 24:33.638
[Tiki] It's time to get to Level 2.

24:35.240 --> 24:36.842
[audience cheering]

24:36.908 --> 24:39.478
[Tiki] Lisa Sarcinelli
stole the show in Level 1

24:39.544 --> 24:42.681
and was the only female athlete
to advance to Level 2.

24:42.747 --> 24:45.617
[in Italian] You're the princess
of parkour, never forget that!

24:45.951 --> 24:49.054
[Chris] We're gonna have eight go in.
Only the top five are moving off.

24:49.120 --> 24:52.657
From Italy, we got a weight lifter -
Tiziano Battista.

24:55.093 --> 24:56.895
[Tiziano] I am a mechanic.

24:57.496 --> 25:00.298
I opened a small garage with my dad,

25:00.365 --> 25:03.001
about three, four years ago.

25:03.068 --> 25:04.269
I love my job.

25:04.336 --> 25:07.606
Opening a business with my family
was always my dream.

25:07.672 --> 25:10.509
We have a great relationship.

25:10.575 --> 25:13.445
I want to win this competition
for my whole family,

25:13.512 --> 25:15.647
because there isn't just one person

25:15.714 --> 25:17.215
that I want to win for.

25:17.282 --> 25:20.585
I consider my family
to be one single group,

25:20.652 --> 25:23.021
one body, with one shared metabolism.

25:26.091 --> 25:28.793
Come on, Tiziano! We all support you!

25:28.860 --> 25:30.028
Go, Tiziano!

25:30.095 --> 25:32.731
[Chris] And he is jumping up
Spinal Ascent.

25:32.797 --> 25:35.467
It's the Beast's vertebrae,
it's his backbone.

25:39.104 --> 25:41.239
[Tiki] This is a bit more difficult
than it looks,

25:41.306 --> 25:44.576
because those vertebrae
are moving up and down.

25:44.643 --> 25:48.280
So if you mistime your jump,
you're going to go falling.

25:48.346 --> 25:50.215
[audience applauds]

25:54.819 --> 25:57.389
♪ Tiziano, we have Tiziano! ♪

25:59.991 --> 26:01.993
Tiziano, get a better hold of it!

26:02.060 --> 26:07.432
[Tiki] And now, he'll go down
a series of cords in Spinal Descent.

26:07.499 --> 26:10.869
Now, it's a lot more complicated
than it looks.

26:11.369 --> 26:15.507
[Chris] Right, because you get stuck in
there, and you get your foot caught.

26:15.574 --> 26:16.641
Look at him...

26:16.708 --> 26:19.177
See, this is where
having a man bun is no bueno,

26:19.244 --> 26:21.513
because you may get your man bun stuck
in the coil.

26:23.582 --> 26:26.451
[Tiki] And obviously, as
you get down through, you could fall off

26:26.518 --> 26:28.086
down into the blood of the Beast.

26:28.153 --> 26:29.120
You don't want that!

26:30.121 --> 26:31.456
The Stomach Churn.

26:31.523 --> 26:34.059
The Stomach Churn.

26:34.125 --> 26:35.093
[Bianca laughs]

26:36.227 --> 26:39.998
[Tiki] He passed up the Point Thruster.
This is all about points.

26:42.968 --> 26:43.969
[Chris] Wow.

26:44.970 --> 26:46.404
[audience cheering]

26:54.479 --> 26:55.647
[Chris] See, look at that.

26:56.081 --> 26:58.149
Ouch!

26:58.483 --> 27:01.119
[Tiki] Barely made it.
He may have injured himself, though.

27:01.186 --> 27:03.455
[Chris] Spinning around,
trying to get your footing.

27:04.122 --> 27:05.290
That's what I call life.

27:05.357 --> 27:09.060
[Tiki] Tiziano now has to jump up
through the Digestive Track.

27:11.329 --> 27:13.365
You know, I think he's just dizzy.

27:13.431 --> 27:15.033
-[Chris] Yeah.
-[Tiki] You're dizzy!

27:15.100 --> 27:17.869
-[Chris] Yeah.
-[Tiki] He makes it. Timed it perfectly.

27:17.936 --> 27:20.238
And now he has to climb up
the Digestive Track.

27:20.305 --> 27:21.873
The issue with this track,

27:21.940 --> 27:26.011
eventually, it's gonna start sinking
into the water as we see here.

27:27.312 --> 27:28.279
Now he's gotta jump.

27:28.346 --> 27:33.084
This is a pretty far jump
to get to the Dreadmills.

27:34.919 --> 27:35.854
[commentators groan]

27:35.920 --> 27:37.255
[Tiki] He can't make it.

27:37.689 --> 27:38.957
[both] No!

27:39.024 --> 27:41.092
-Tiziano!
-No!

27:41.159 --> 27:43.561
-He fell right there!
-Oh!

27:43.628 --> 27:46.164
And it took him too long!

27:46.231 --> 27:49.501
[Tiki] If you don't jump off
that Digestive Track when it's high,

27:49.567 --> 27:52.537
that's a hard jump
to get onto the Dreadmills.

27:52.604 --> 27:54.272
It looks like he hurt himself.

27:54.339 --> 27:59.244
He really tweaked his ankle, jumping
onto the last of the Stomach Churns.

27:59.310 --> 28:01.680
Oh, man! He fell hard!

28:02.113 --> 28:04.582
I had no strength in my left leg.

28:05.183 --> 28:08.620
It's hard to pull off that jump
with only one leg.

28:09.054 --> 28:12.023
[Tiki] Tiziano added 50 points in Level 2.

28:12.490 --> 28:15.326
Next up is Rishi Prasad from India.

28:15.393 --> 28:16.995
[chanting] Rishi!

28:22.434 --> 28:23.501
[in Hindi] Moving a lot.

28:23.568 --> 28:26.304
-Come on, Doctor.
-He has to get onto them quickly.

28:27.906 --> 28:29.574
[in English] Oh, that was fast.

28:29.641 --> 28:30.809
Come on, Doctor.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.078
[Tiki] These are probably, what?

28:33.144 --> 28:37.415
[Chris] These are vertebrae. We're in
the thoracic spine - the T5 to T12 area.

28:39.918 --> 28:43.488
-[in Hindi] He's accumulated 25 points.
-Yeah, Doctor!

28:44.022 --> 28:45.990
[Tiki] He's through Spinal Ascent.

28:46.057 --> 28:50.228
Now he goes into Spinal Descent.

28:50.795 --> 28:53.531
[Chris] Rishi is actually an ER doctor
at home,

28:53.598 --> 28:56.234
so he should understand
the body of the Beast.

28:56.534 --> 28:58.436
This is the spinal cord of the Beast.

28:58.503 --> 29:01.439
He's stepping on its nerves.
The Beast is getting pissed.

29:01.506 --> 29:02.540
[Tiki laughs]

29:02.974 --> 29:05.744
[Tiki] The first of the Stomach Churns
is not spinning

29:05.810 --> 29:08.346
so you can delicately step on.

29:08.413 --> 29:11.182
But after that, it gets a little dicey.

29:12.684 --> 29:14.886
He passed up the Point Thruster.

29:15.386 --> 29:21.292
Now these Stomach Churns' wheels are
going at about 12 or so miles an hour.

29:21.359 --> 29:22.794
It's disorienting.

29:23.161 --> 29:24.863
You have to time it just right,

29:24.929 --> 29:26.431
otherwise you're gonna miss

29:26.498 --> 29:30.001
and jump directly
into the waiting blood of the Beast below.

29:31.202 --> 29:34.305
[Chris] He's getting up and sitting down,
trying get his orientation.

29:35.273 --> 29:37.375
Oh, Rishi! Oh, be careful!

29:38.643 --> 29:41.446
[Tiki] You can imagine
how disorienting that is.

29:41.513 --> 29:43.481
-[Chris] Wow!
-[Tiki] But he lands it!

29:43.548 --> 29:44.616
-Wow.
-Wow!

29:44.682 --> 29:47.085
-That's what a good jump is.
-Well done, Rishi!

29:47.152 --> 29:49.120
His parkour technique helped him there.

29:49.187 --> 29:51.456
[Tiki] Now, remember from Tiziano,

29:51.523 --> 29:54.559
when you get to this Digestive Track,
you've got to move,

29:54.626 --> 29:57.262
because it starts to sink
into the blood, and if...

29:57.328 --> 29:59.464
Oh! He's slipping backwards!

29:59.531 --> 30:01.266
Oh! Oh! No, no, no, no!

30:01.666 --> 30:03.334
-Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
-Oh, oh.

30:03.401 --> 30:05.503
-No! No, no, no, no, no!
-Oh, no.

30:06.504 --> 30:08.506
[Sarah-Jane] No, no! Go, go! Come on!

30:08.573 --> 30:10.942
[Tiki] He let his limbs
get into the blood of the Beast.

30:11.009 --> 30:12.043
He's out, man. Out!

30:12.110 --> 30:13.711
[Chris] Rishi, stop! You're out.

30:13.778 --> 30:17.115
Those four parts of the body
can't get wet.

30:17.182 --> 30:18.283
I don't...

30:18.349 --> 30:20.318
This isn't fair, Vidyut.

30:20.852 --> 30:22.120
[Tiki] Here's the replay.

30:22.187 --> 30:24.856
As we take a look back,
you see it right there.

30:24.923 --> 30:28.159
All four of Rishi's limbs
dip into the blood of the Beast,

30:28.226 --> 30:30.695
and by rule, that means he's out.

30:31.329 --> 30:32.330
[chanting] USA!

30:32.397 --> 30:37.435
[Tiki] It's our American
and current leader, Kyle Soderman.

30:37.502 --> 30:39.871
Now he's going down
through Spinal Descent.

30:39.938 --> 30:43.241
Let's see how efficiently he gets
through. He's hung up a little bit.

30:43.775 --> 30:45.877
[team USA chanting] Oossaa! Oossaa!

30:45.944 --> 30:47.145
[Tiki] An "oossaa" chant.

30:48.012 --> 30:52.550
Oossaa! Oossaa! Oossaa! Oossaa!
Oossaa! Oossaa! Oossaa! Oossaa!

30:53.685 --> 30:55.920
-[Tiki] He hit the Point Thruster.
-[Chris] He hit it.

30:55.987 --> 30:59.123
[Tiki] That is one that a lot of
the competitors haven't even looked at,

30:59.190 --> 31:01.192
but Kyle's smart like this.

31:06.898 --> 31:10.301
And unlike previous competitors,
you see him walking in place,

31:10.368 --> 31:13.471
as opposed to letting
the Stomach Churn spin him around.

31:13.538 --> 31:16.441
He's going for the second Point Thruster.

31:16.808 --> 31:18.376
This one is much more difficult.

31:18.443 --> 31:22.747
He got it! Look at that balance
as he jumps off, lands on his feet.

31:23.248 --> 31:25.850
Look at Kyle Soderman go!

31:25.917 --> 31:27.552
He's getting little jig on, too.

31:28.019 --> 31:29.821
That is nice, it's like he's dancing.

31:29.888 --> 31:32.190
You go! You do you, John Travolta!

31:34.459 --> 31:36.261
[Tiki] He climbs into the Digestive Track.

31:36.327 --> 31:39.931
This is all about speed, and urgency
to get to the top of the Track,

31:39.998 --> 31:42.267
because if you don't jump
when it's still high,

31:42.333 --> 31:44.802
it's almost impossible
to land on the Dreadmill.

31:44.869 --> 31:46.037
[Chris] He's moving!

31:46.104 --> 31:48.539
[Tiki] He's got a chance.
He jumps and he lands it!

31:48.606 --> 31:50.508
Five extra points! Now ten points!

31:50.575 --> 31:53.745
Five more points opportunities
as he jumps off the Dreadmill.

31:53.811 --> 31:55.513
Kyle Soderman is rocking this!

31:55.580 --> 31:58.316
[Chris] He's off the Dreadmill.
He's going into Chain Reaction.

31:59.150 --> 32:00.318
What I'm talking about!

32:01.552 --> 32:03.254
[Tiki] There he goes, he's jumping off.

32:04.355 --> 32:06.925
He got it! He got another Point Thruster!

32:06.991 --> 32:10.094
He's gotten
all three Point Thrusters so far

32:10.161 --> 32:12.030
on the second level of the Beast.

32:15.967 --> 32:17.635
[Chris] This guy is unbelievable!

32:17.702 --> 32:20.638
[Tiki] Unbelievable is right.
He's like Tarzan.

32:23.074 --> 32:26.010
[Chris] Oh! That's how you do it, brother!

32:26.077 --> 32:29.948
[Tiki] He's through the Chain Reaction
and on to Vertabrace.

32:30.014 --> 32:33.151
He's holding on
to balance himself with that last chain,

32:33.217 --> 32:37.722
and pull the vertebrae
back and forth to get a sway,

32:37.789 --> 32:40.658
so that he can jump
into the next vertebrae.

32:40.992 --> 32:43.661
This is the farthest
we've seen a competitor get.

32:45.229 --> 32:47.198
Now this has got to be nerve-wracking.

32:48.032 --> 32:52.470
He's going for the last
and fourth Point Thruster.

32:55.273 --> 32:56.641
Which he nails.

32:56.708 --> 33:01.713
Kyle Soderman
has all four Point Thrusters.

33:02.080 --> 33:04.649
[Chris] Those vertebrae
look like swinging Prince symbols.

33:05.817 --> 33:09.320
-[Tiki] This man knows how to play.
-[Chris] Yeah!

33:09.821 --> 33:12.056
[Tiki] 255 points now.

33:12.123 --> 33:15.660
[in English] Please, give us some points.
Give us some points.

33:16.427 --> 33:19.364
-The Italians want some of our points.
-260 points.

33:19.430 --> 33:20.698
[Tiki] He is crushing it!

33:20.765 --> 33:22.834
Jump! Jump!

33:22.900 --> 33:27.105
[Tiki] One more jump.
One more jump for Kyle Soderman.

33:27.505 --> 33:28.539
[Chris] USA!

33:28.606 --> 33:31.109
[Tiki and Chris]
He's gonna complete Level 2.

33:31.509 --> 33:32.977
[audience cheering]

33:33.044 --> 33:35.613
[Tiki] Kyle Soderman completes Level 2!

33:35.913 --> 33:36.814
Yeah!

33:37.615 --> 33:40.084
[Chris] And there goes the American team
running after him,

33:40.151 --> 33:41.419
because that was amazing.

33:41.486 --> 33:43.688
[Tiki] That was textbook.

33:43.755 --> 33:48.192
-[Chris] I love you, Kyle.
-[Tiki] This kid is unbelievable.

33:48.826 --> 33:50.461
-Oossaa!
-[team USA] Oossaa!

33:51.763 --> 33:53.898
-[Qinyi] Good job!
-Thank you!

33:54.932 --> 33:56.367
[Chris] Yeah! Yeah!

33:57.769 --> 33:59.537
[Tiki] A lot of kissing
going on over here.

34:00.004 --> 34:01.572
[Chris] Everybody's making out with me.

34:01.639 --> 34:03.941
Keeping up public relations with China.

34:04.008 --> 34:09.414
-[general chatter]
-[Bin in English] Congratulations.

34:09.480 --> 34:11.983
Dude, I am so pumped right now.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.784
I did exactly what I wanted to do.

34:13.851 --> 34:15.920
I wanted to get as many points
as possible,

34:15.987 --> 34:18.523
and I got all of them,
so I did pretty well.

34:19.157 --> 34:22.927
[Tiki] That's what you'd call
a perfect, perfect run.

34:22.994 --> 34:24.929
[Chris] 270 points - are you kidding me?

34:24.996 --> 34:28.232
270, that's my cholesterol right there.

34:28.299 --> 34:29.367
That's pretty high.

34:29.434 --> 34:32.136
[chanting] Come on, Yunpeng!

34:32.203 --> 34:35.572
[Chris] Okay, next up for China,
Yunpeng Zhang.

34:35.639 --> 34:39.444
Gonna try to follow what Soderman did,
which is rip the Beast in half.

34:39.510 --> 34:42.480
How you feeling, Beast?
You'll be limping to work tomorrow.

34:44.916 --> 34:45.783
[exclaims]

34:45.850 --> 34:48.286
Before I trained for parkour,

34:48.351 --> 34:50.420
I really liked to play video games.

34:50.487 --> 34:52.956
After I discovered parkour,

34:53.357 --> 34:54.492
it changed my life.

34:56.360 --> 35:00.298
When I was thinking of a signature
movement, I decided on flipping over cars.

35:00.364 --> 35:06.070
Flipping over cars
is now my signature move.

35:09.707 --> 35:11.109
In Asia,

35:11.175 --> 35:14.145
nobody does it except me.

35:14.212 --> 35:15.746
Joining this competition

35:15.813 --> 35:19.117
and competing with contestants
from five other countries,

35:19.183 --> 35:22.620
I want the other contestants to know

35:22.687 --> 35:24.622
that the Chinese team is powerful.

35:27.458 --> 35:29.794
[Chris] Yunpeng Zhang
going through Spinal Descent,

35:29.861 --> 35:31.996
or as I like to call it,
Silly String City.

35:32.063 --> 35:32.897
[Tiki laughs]

35:32.964 --> 35:35.066
[Tiki] It does look like
a bunch of Silly String.

35:39.103 --> 35:40.705
Yunpeng may have some trouble!

35:40.771 --> 35:43.074
He's going for the Point Thruster.

35:43.141 --> 35:46.310
He missed it.
Will he try to go back and get it again?

35:46.377 --> 35:49.680
-[Chris] I don't know about this.
-[Tiki] He could be compromised here.

35:50.915 --> 35:54.886
-Yes, he does!
-[Chris]That was like a flying ninja kick.

35:54.952 --> 35:56.254
Let's do it together,

35:56.320 --> 35:58.055
Chinese Kung Fu. [exclaims]

35:58.122 --> 35:59.991
-Hey, you tore your pants.
-[both laugh]

36:00.591 --> 36:03.161
[Tiki] Can he get out
of the blood of the Beast?

36:03.227 --> 36:06.597
Remember all four limbs have to be in.
He lands it.

36:08.232 --> 36:09.667
He finds a way out.

36:10.168 --> 36:12.036
Good job for Yunpeng Zhang.

36:13.804 --> 36:19.143
The issue is, his shoes are now wet
on the spinning Stomach Churn.

36:19.510 --> 36:21.412
[Chris] Nothing worse than wet feet.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.583
See, he's trying to copy
what Soderman did.

36:25.650 --> 36:27.919
-[Tiki] He is.
-[Chris] Yo, don't bite off Soderman.

36:28.619 --> 36:29.587
You ain't Soderman.

36:29.654 --> 36:33.090
[Tiki] Hard, hard landing
on that last Stomach Churn.

36:33.157 --> 36:34.292
We know it's an issue.

36:34.358 --> 36:38.095
When your feet are wet, it's often hard
to run up this Digestive Track.

36:38.162 --> 36:40.064
-Oh!
-[screams]

36:40.131 --> 36:42.800
[Chris] And he fell into the blood
of the Beast.

36:42.867 --> 36:45.036
It's because he got his shoes wet.

36:45.102 --> 36:50.074
His shoes couldn't grip on the tube.

36:50.141 --> 36:52.577
It's a shame
that Yunpeng fell into the water.

36:56.614 --> 37:01.786
[Tiki] Yoann Leroux, starting Level 2
with 50 points, is next up.

37:04.322 --> 37:06.791
[Yoann in French] I do both parkour
and freerunning.

37:06.857 --> 37:07.992
I train every day.

37:08.059 --> 37:10.995
Every time I see something,
I just have to jump over it. [laughs]

37:11.062 --> 37:12.897
I was in a video for a video game.

37:13.931 --> 37:14.799
They hired us,

37:14.865 --> 37:17.935
because me and my team
know the rooftops of Paris inside out

37:18.002 --> 37:21.439
and we jump from rooftop to rooftop,
over very long distances.

37:21.505 --> 37:23.941
We've got over 40 million views.

37:24.976 --> 37:27.411
I'll face any mythical beast
that crosses me.

37:27.478 --> 37:29.680
The Beast is there to be beaten.

37:29.747 --> 37:31.983
I have so much respect
for my opponents.

37:32.049 --> 37:34.986
Good luck to them
when they go head-to-head against me.

37:36.787 --> 37:40.391
[Tiki] Yoann Leroux of France
is already on Spinal Descent.

37:40.458 --> 37:42.426
France is with you all the way, Yoann!

37:42.493 --> 37:45.329
[Tiki] The question becomes,
when you get to the bottom,

37:45.396 --> 37:47.732
how do you attack that Point Thruster?

37:47.798 --> 37:49.967
We saw Kyle beast it earlier,

37:50.034 --> 37:53.271
which means now Yoann
needs every single point available

37:53.337 --> 37:55.373
just to keep it within striking distance.

37:55.439 --> 37:57.975
[Chris] You don't want wet feet.
That's the thing you don't want.

37:58.042 --> 38:01.479
So if you wanna get that Point Thruster,
you better keep your feet dry.

38:01.545 --> 38:03.447
-He's going for it!
-[Tiki] He's going for it!

38:03.514 --> 38:05.082
Look at that strategy!

38:05.149 --> 38:06.884
-Can he get back?
-[Chris] Good strategy.

38:06.951 --> 38:08.586
[Tiki] That was smart and impressive!

38:08.653 --> 38:11.989
Do you know what core and ab strength
it takes to do that?

38:15.526 --> 38:20.665
He just showed us
why he is a world parkour champion.

38:22.633 --> 38:25.469
He doesn't try
for the second Point Thruster.

38:25.936 --> 38:27.038
Now he's got to hustle.

38:27.104 --> 38:30.675
He's got to move very quickly
up this Digestive Track,

38:30.741 --> 38:32.310
because it's all about height.

38:34.645 --> 38:37.515
You've got to jump off that thing
while it's still above...

38:37.581 --> 38:39.517
[Chris] And he made it onto the Dreadmill!

38:39.583 --> 38:42.586
[Tiki] But the Dreadmill is moving
backwards, you can't stand still.

38:42.653 --> 38:45.122
He's onto the second of the Dreadmills.

38:46.791 --> 38:49.126
Collecting himself.
He jumps to the third one.

38:49.193 --> 38:51.729
Perfect! Perfect, Yoann! Go!

38:53.798 --> 38:54.999
[Chris] Kyle ain't worried.

38:55.866 --> 38:58.636
[Tiki] These chains are not easy
to swing through.

38:58.703 --> 39:02.039
We'll see if he'll try to go
after that Point Thruster like Kyle did.

39:03.341 --> 39:06.877
He is going for the Point Thruster,
and he gets it!

39:06.944 --> 39:09.313
-Ten points for Yoann Leroux!
-[Chris] Wow!

39:09.380 --> 39:11.649
-He's keeping pace with Soderman.
-[Tiki] He is!

39:11.716 --> 39:16.520
In order to keep any kind of pace, he does
have to get all the points possible.

39:16.587 --> 39:18.089
-Go, Yoann!
-Go, Yoann!

39:18.155 --> 39:20.591
-[Chris] Having trouble on Chain Reaction.
-[Tiki] He is.

39:20.658 --> 39:23.994
You see, what happens here, Chris,
is you slow down that momentum.

39:24.061 --> 39:27.665
-His hands...
-[Chris] His arms have to be on fire.

39:28.999 --> 39:30.134
No!

39:30.768 --> 39:35.673
-I want you to suffer! Ping, ping!
-Oh my, I feel so bad!

39:35.740 --> 39:40.544
He did okay.
He got quite far into the Beast.

39:40.611 --> 39:42.680
Much further than the Italians.

39:42.747 --> 39:44.682
[Chris] So, he fell
into the blood of the Beast,

39:44.749 --> 39:47.952
but he's got 155 points,
good enough for second place.

39:48.018 --> 39:50.221
So, it's not a complete washout.

39:50.287 --> 39:52.022
My arms got tired really quickly.

39:53.157 --> 39:54.925
I'm very disappointed.

39:55.993 --> 39:56.927
[sighs frustratedly]

39:56.994 --> 39:59.930
[Chris] Remember,
only five of these eight competitors

39:59.997 --> 40:02.199
will advance to the next level.

40:02.266 --> 40:04.535
And Rishi Prasad from India
is on the bubble.

40:04.602 --> 40:08.539
Next up, we have our American brother,
Jeremey Adam Rey.

40:09.206 --> 40:13.511
Jeremey needs just more than 35 points
to knock out poor old Rishi.

40:16.781 --> 40:19.250
[audience applauds]

40:19.984 --> 40:23.053
[Tiki] Patience is key. Patience is key.

40:26.524 --> 40:27.992
Uh-oh! He's having trouble.

40:28.058 --> 40:29.326
[Chris] Oh, Jeremey, come on!

40:29.627 --> 40:31.262
Oh, he's having a really tough...

40:31.328 --> 40:33.697
I didn't expect Jeremey
to have trouble with this.

40:33.764 --> 40:36.667
-Use those abdominals!
-First man out of the competition.

40:36.734 --> 40:39.270
[Tiki] This takes a lot
of upper body strength

40:39.336 --> 40:41.972
to pull yourself up over the lift here.

40:42.039 --> 40:44.341
You got a chant of "Jeremey"
from Team USA.

40:44.408 --> 40:45.342
Can he make it?

40:46.143 --> 40:47.812
-Can he make it?
-[Chris] Come on!

40:47.878 --> 40:49.013
[Tiki] Can he make it up?

40:49.079 --> 40:50.614
No! Don't quit!

40:52.450 --> 40:53.951
[commentators and audience groan]

40:55.186 --> 40:56.454
[Tiki] Jeremey is down.

40:56.821 --> 40:59.223
He's got to be so disappointed.

40:59.290 --> 41:02.760
[Chris] Wow, and Rishi survives for now.

41:02.827 --> 41:04.495
-Rishi's in. Yay!
-Yeah.

41:04.562 --> 41:06.564
[both laugh]

41:06.630 --> 41:10.201
[Tiki] And Jeremey Adam Rey is eliminated.

41:10.267 --> 41:13.204
-Paula, and the next one is from...
-Spain!

41:13.270 --> 41:14.738
Let's go get them, Aitor!

41:14.805 --> 41:16.040
[Tiki] Here's where we stand.

41:16.106 --> 41:18.642
Rishi is still sitting up on the bubble,

41:18.709 --> 41:22.146
and if Aitor Dominguez of Spain
gets through the Digestive Track,

41:22.213 --> 41:24.415
then, Dr. Rishi, you're amputated.

41:25.716 --> 41:29.186
Aitor going down Spinal Descent now.

41:29.620 --> 41:32.389
-We're almost there. Go, Spain!
-The flag is upside down!

41:32.456 --> 41:34.758
-Come on, Spain!
-We're with you, Aitor!

41:34.825 --> 41:36.160
Spain!

41:36.227 --> 41:39.730
[Chris, in Spanish] Spain! Spain!

41:40.331 --> 41:41.899
[Tiki] He's rocking that great beard.

41:41.966 --> 41:44.735
[Chris] Oh, yeah, he's an Adonis.
Look at how physically fit he is.

41:44.802 --> 41:46.604
[Tiki] That leap was easy.

41:46.670 --> 41:49.173
Well done, Aitor.
He's keeping a great pace.

41:49.240 --> 41:51.775
[Tiki] Now he's going
through Stomach Churn.

41:51.842 --> 41:54.678
-[Chris] We'll see what he does.
-[Tiki] Not going for the Thruster.

41:54.745 --> 41:55.813
[Chris] He doesn't care.

41:56.814 --> 41:58.983
[shocked voices overlapping]

41:59.750 --> 42:02.419
[Chris] My God, that has to hurt bad!

42:02.887 --> 42:04.855
And Rishi has survived again.

42:05.322 --> 42:08.492
That is literally
one of the hardest falls you'll see.

42:08.559 --> 42:09.960
[Tiki] What a massive... Oh!

42:10.027 --> 42:12.162
[Chris] Oh, my goodness!

42:12.730 --> 42:15.733
Man! He may poop out his kidney tonight.

42:16.367 --> 42:19.670
Yes, I hit my elbow
and I hurt myself a bit.

42:20.271 --> 42:22.573
No, my back is fine. It's more the elbow.

42:22.640 --> 42:24.942
I thought it would be a bit softer!

42:25.943 --> 42:28.546
[Tiki] And Rishi survives.

42:29.013 --> 42:31.382
So it comes down to our final competitor.

42:31.448 --> 42:33.584
Okay, we're coming here for you guys.

42:33.651 --> 42:35.586
-Hi.
-[Chris] Because your boy's gonna get in.

42:35.653 --> 42:37.288
-Rishi's gonna get in.
-[Sarah-Jane] Yes.

42:37.354 --> 42:38.722
It all depends on Lisa.

42:39.189 --> 42:41.959
[Tiki] Now Lisa has to get 50 points,

42:42.026 --> 42:46.196
which means that she has to clear
Stomach Churn to get to Level 3.

42:46.964 --> 42:50.100
-She's a parkour teacher.
-Go, Rishi. Don't worry, Rishi.

42:52.369 --> 42:53.237
[Tiki] Lisa.

42:53.304 --> 42:55.706
-[Vidyut in English] Lisa is moving it.
-[Tiki] She is moving.

42:58.208 --> 43:00.644
[Vidyut] Whoa! That's a good leap.
That's a good leap.

43:00.711 --> 43:02.012
Go, go, go, go!

43:02.079 --> 43:04.782
Come on, Lisa! You can make it!

43:05.382 --> 43:06.917
[Indian hosts] Fall down! Fall down!

43:06.984 --> 43:09.820
-Fall, Lisa!
-We want you to fall!

43:10.187 --> 43:11.221
[Sarah-Jane] Fall!

43:11.555 --> 43:12.856
[Chris] Fall!

43:12.923 --> 43:15.759
-[Vidyut] Lisa, fall!
-I want Sarah to be happy.

43:17.227 --> 43:18.662
[Chris chuckling] That's all I want.

43:20.664 --> 43:22.633
Try again!

43:23.601 --> 43:25.736
[all] Oh!

43:25.803 --> 43:26.704
And Lisa's out.

43:27.304 --> 43:29.039
[Vidyut] And now, she is wet.

43:29.106 --> 43:31.141
[Tiki] She is out of the competition.

43:32.309 --> 43:35.579
-She just gave up.
-You were the only woman!

43:36.013 --> 43:37.982
[Tiki] India goes through.

43:38.048 --> 43:39.149
Rishi Prasad.

43:39.216 --> 43:40.951
-Yay.
-Yeah!

43:41.852 --> 43:44.188
That is Doctor Prasad.

43:44.254 --> 43:46.790
-Wait, we've got do the dance.
-We've got do the...

43:47.191 --> 43:50.194
[humming Bollywood-style tune]

43:52.763 --> 43:55.733
[Tiki] Every country except Spain

43:55.799 --> 44:00.771
will be represented in Level 3
on the Ultimate Beastmaster.

44:02.206 --> 44:05.376
[Yoann in English] That is beautiful.
Beast, we're ready for you.

44:05.676 --> 44:07.111
The Beast is getting angry.

44:09.380 --> 44:10.748
We're going to finish it.

44:10.814 --> 44:11.949
She's getting pissed.

44:12.650 --> 44:15.352
[Tiki] This is what I love
about international competitions -

44:15.419 --> 44:16.553
they all root for each other.

44:16.620 --> 44:18.689
[Chris] All right,
we have reached Level 3.

44:18.756 --> 44:20.190
We have five competitors.

44:20.257 --> 44:22.793
Only two will survive to go on to Level 4.

44:22.860 --> 44:26.930
And who better to start it off
than our American champ, Kyle Soderman?

44:27.564 --> 44:29.566
Oossaa! Oossaa! Oossaa! Oossaa!

44:30.000 --> 44:32.569
[Tiki] That belt
is going 12 miles an hour.

44:32.636 --> 44:35.172
[Chris] I can't get on a treadmill
going three miles an hour.

44:36.807 --> 44:38.609
And he's on to the Ejector.

44:40.411 --> 44:43.681
[Tiki] Good jump.
Successfully off the Ejector.

44:45.649 --> 44:48.285
He gets the Point Thruster.

44:48.352 --> 44:53.157
Kyle Soderman, as always,
very calculated and meticulous.

44:53.524 --> 44:56.794
Each one of these Coil Crawls
will give him five points,

44:56.860 --> 45:00.130
but these things sink
into the fuel of the Pyramid,

45:00.197 --> 45:01.865
so you have to be quick.

45:04.068 --> 45:05.669
Here we go. Made it easy.

45:08.439 --> 45:14.378
And Kyle hits the second
of the four Point Thrusters on Level 3.

45:14.445 --> 45:18.015
And again,
this is a cumulative score contest,

45:18.082 --> 45:19.850
so every point matters.

45:20.718 --> 45:23.420
-He's dominating this so far.
-[Chris] Kyle's looking good!

45:24.354 --> 45:26.123
[audience cheering]

45:26.590 --> 45:30.494
[Tiki] I've got to tell you, Kyle's just
got the ability to process an obstacle

45:30.561 --> 45:31.595
really quickly.

45:31.662 --> 45:34.732
[Chris] Well, he builds obstacles at home.
Like, that's what he does.

45:34.798 --> 45:38.102
So, he can probably see it
like the engineer saw it.

45:39.470 --> 45:41.538
[Tiki] Through Coil Crawl.

45:42.005 --> 45:44.808
Kyle Soderman is now on to Hangman.

45:46.110 --> 45:47.978
The interesting thing about Hangman,

45:48.045 --> 45:51.081
is that if you get you stuck,
you cannot go backwards.

45:51.415 --> 45:52.282
Why?

45:52.349 --> 45:55.886
Because watch when Kyle
lets go of one of these rings.

45:56.587 --> 46:00.924
When he lets go of one of these rings,
it pulls up into the Beast.

46:00.991 --> 46:04.194
Yes. It's a lot of hanging
that's going on here.

46:05.329 --> 46:09.166
-[chanting] USA! USA! USA!
-[Tiki] Hangman is very difficult.

46:09.233 --> 46:12.069
You can see Kyle here
trying to use his legs,

46:12.136 --> 46:14.772
and pulling himself up to rest his arms.

46:14.838 --> 46:19.343
[Chris] Every second that goes by,
his biceps and all his shoulder muscles

46:19.409 --> 46:23.013
are draining energy from his upper body,
and he's gonna need a lot of it.

46:23.080 --> 46:27.050
He's having a hard time
grabbing on to that Hangman ring.

46:27.384 --> 46:29.653
-[Chris] Shaking his hands out.
-[Tiki] Oh, he got it!

46:29.720 --> 46:31.421
-Finally got it!
-Nice!

46:31.488 --> 46:33.357
Now he's got to move forward,

46:33.423 --> 46:36.426
he's got three more rings
before he has a chance at Pipeline.

46:37.127 --> 46:38.195
[Kyle groans]

46:39.363 --> 46:42.599
And Kyle's trying to use
other parts of his body.

46:42.666 --> 46:46.637
Went upside down, and finally gives way.

46:46.703 --> 46:51.141
Kyle Soderman
with 75 points on Level 3,

46:51.208 --> 46:56.313
giving him a grand total of 350 points

46:56.880 --> 46:58.415
through Levels 1, 2 and 3.

46:58.482 --> 47:01.885
And again,
this is a cumulative score contest,

47:01.952 --> 47:04.021
so every point matters.

47:04.087 --> 47:05.889
I'm feeling great.

47:05.956 --> 47:07.825
It was honestly a fun course.

47:07.891 --> 47:11.295
It's been a while since I had something
that taxed me that hard.

47:11.361 --> 47:14.198
I have a huge point cushion.
I can't be happier right now.

47:15.365 --> 47:16.633
Yeah, you too.

47:17.601 --> 47:20.070
Go to the warm place.
We're gonna join you soon.

47:20.671 --> 47:22.739
And now, it's our Tiziano's turn.

47:22.806 --> 47:25.542
Tiziano Battista. I am so nervous.

47:25.609 --> 47:27.644
I'm so excited! Come on, Tiziano!

47:28.011 --> 47:30.214
[horn sounds]

47:31.715 --> 47:36.220
[Chris] Oh, wow! Tiziano Battista
fell on the ramp up to the Ejector.

47:36.286 --> 47:38.455
[commentators groan]

47:38.822 --> 47:40.190
Oh!

47:40.624 --> 47:44.895
This goes to prove
how difficult the third level is.

47:45.829 --> 47:47.097
[Tiki] Oh, he slipped.

47:47.164 --> 47:49.166
And it looked like he hurt his ankle.

47:49.600 --> 47:54.671
Before he could even jump, he was falling
into the fuel of the Pyramid.

47:54.938 --> 47:58.775
-No points for Tiziano Battista.
-[Bianca groans]

48:00.277 --> 48:03.180
[in English] Guys, I guess it's harder
than it looks on the screen.

48:03.247 --> 48:04.848
-That's hard.
-Yes.

48:04.915 --> 48:06.183
That's hard.

48:06.516 --> 48:07.718
I know, I know.

48:07.784 --> 48:10.487
Your Kyle is just beyond.

48:10.554 --> 48:12.089
-Francesco died.
-He is dead.

48:12.155 --> 48:15.659
Can you pretend you're full-on Italian
and co-host with me?

48:16.226 --> 48:18.428
[in Italian] Go, USA! Go, USA!

48:19.496 --> 48:23.634
[Tiki] Rishi Prasad,
coming into Level 3 with 85 points.

48:23.700 --> 48:26.069
[Chris] His friends call him
the Rishi peanut butter cup.

48:26.136 --> 48:27.437
He loves peanut butter.

48:27.971 --> 48:30.307
-[Tiki] Is that true?
-[Chris] No, that's not. I made it up.

48:30.374 --> 48:33.210
But he did spend six years in Russia
studying medicine.

48:33.277 --> 48:35.345
So, I guess he's a doctor.

48:35.412 --> 48:37.915
Rishi! Rishi! Come on, Rishi!

48:37.981 --> 48:39.850
Come on, Rishi.

48:39.917 --> 48:41.318
[Sarah-Jane] Go, Doctor.

48:41.385 --> 48:43.120
[Tiki] First up, the Ejector.

48:43.754 --> 48:45.088
[commentators groan]

48:45.589 --> 48:47.691
[Tiki] Oh, wow! He comes up short!

48:47.758 --> 48:50.527
-Oh, man!
-Come on, Rishi, buddy.

48:50.594 --> 48:54.197
[Tiki] And he's into the fuel
of the Pyramid.

48:54.264 --> 48:58.135
How disappointing this is
for Rishi Prasad.

48:58.568 --> 49:01.705
[Chris] Yo, I bet you he falls
right into the water. 20 bucks.

49:02.272 --> 49:05.842
Oh! And his hands just slipped away.

49:06.543 --> 49:08.111
[Tiki] It's all about timing.

49:08.512 --> 49:10.781
He slipped just a little bit

49:10.847 --> 49:12.849
as he left the Ejector.

49:13.250 --> 49:18.221
If you're timid going down the Ejector,
if you just let the belt pull you along,

49:18.288 --> 49:19.990
it takes control over you.

49:20.557 --> 49:25.262
Look, I gave my best. I'm not happy with
this performance, but what can you do?

49:25.729 --> 49:30.467
[Chris] And the "Prasad" news for Rishi,
he is now out of the competition.

49:30.534 --> 49:34.471
He is out
because only two of the five competitors

49:34.538 --> 49:38.542
move on to Level 4 of the Beast.

49:38.976 --> 49:42.412
Yunpeng Zhang comes into Level 3
with 90 points.

49:42.479 --> 49:46.416
He's 260 behind Kyle Soderman.

49:46.483 --> 49:48.085
Lots of ground to make up.

49:48.318 --> 49:49.820
[cheers]

49:49.886 --> 49:51.054
Ejector.

49:51.555 --> 49:54.057
-[Chris] What does he have to do?
-[Tiki] He's got to own it.

49:54.124 --> 49:57.627
You can't be timid on the belt
like we saw with Tiziano.

49:57.694 --> 50:02.132
[Chris] And Yunpeng Zhang
makes it on to Prism Strike.

50:03.100 --> 50:04.835
[Tiki] He misses the Point Thruster.

50:04.901 --> 50:09.773
Prism Strike's total track length
is 105 feet as it whips around.

50:09.840 --> 50:14.111
Then you have a five foot jump
to the next stage, into Coil Crawl.

50:14.177 --> 50:15.245
[Chris] And he makes it.

50:16.613 --> 50:20.150
[Tiki] He's moving very effectively
and efficiently so far.

50:20.217 --> 50:21.618
[both] You can do it!

50:21.685 --> 50:23.487
-Yunpeng Zhang!
-You can do it!

50:23.553 --> 50:24.388
Yunpeng Zhang!

50:24.855 --> 50:27.024
[Chris] Yunpeng
is a distant third place right now,

50:27.090 --> 50:28.492
but to get to Level 4,

50:28.558 --> 50:30.260
he has to at least reach Hangman

50:30.327 --> 50:33.096
and hope for Yoann Le-Kanga-Roux
to have a poor run.

50:33.797 --> 50:37.768
[Tiki] Every one of those Coil Crawl
completions gives you five points.

50:42.372 --> 50:46.410
[Chris] He is through
almost all three of them.

50:46.476 --> 50:48.945
Looking to get onto Hangman next.

50:49.713 --> 50:54.351
And Hangman is the hardest obstacle
of the entire competition, in my opinion.

50:54.418 --> 50:57.054
[Tiki] Yes, it is,
because it's all upper body strength.

50:57.120 --> 50:59.823
Yunpeng is giving up!

50:59.890 --> 51:03.460
[Chris] He noticed that he can't jump up
to even get to Hangman

51:03.527 --> 51:05.062
so he said, "I'll strike a pose,

51:05.128 --> 51:06.696
show off my body one last time."

51:06.763 --> 51:10.734
Because now Yunpeng Zhang is officially
eliminated from competition.

51:10.801 --> 51:11.868
I'm like a sad baby.

51:13.870 --> 51:15.739
-Don't be sad.
-[whines]

51:18.108 --> 51:21.978
[Tiki] Because of the earlier eliminations
of the other competitors,

51:22.045 --> 51:27.317
Yoann Leroux
is already guaranteed to be in Level 4.

51:27.384 --> 51:31.388
The issue, though,
is pointing is all cumulative.

51:31.455 --> 51:37.861
So currently, he's 195 points
behind our leader, Kyle Soderman.

51:37.928 --> 51:42.466
USA versus France on Level 4,
but how close can Yoann get?

51:43.033 --> 51:45.469
-Come on, Yoann!
-Come on, Yoann!

51:46.736 --> 51:48.605
[Tiki] He misses the Point Thruster.

51:49.840 --> 51:54.044
On to that second handheld -
gives him five additional points.

51:54.111 --> 51:56.346
He's racking up the points
as he goes along.

51:56.413 --> 51:59.483
Each one of these Coil Crawls
will give him five points,

51:59.549 --> 52:03.053
but these things sink
into the fuel of the Pyramid,

52:03.120 --> 52:04.721
so you have to be quick.

52:05.422 --> 52:08.024
[Chris] He needs to get through quick.
He's doing a good job.

52:08.091 --> 52:12.195
His strength is...
I mean, rugby, taekwondo, parkour,

52:12.262 --> 52:13.763
he's a strong, strong guy.

52:14.865 --> 52:16.800
[Tiki] But, as you can see,
this Coil Crawl

52:16.867 --> 52:18.902
is not just
a straightforward walk through.

52:18.969 --> 52:20.604
-[Chris] Yeah.
-[Tiki] It's awkward.

52:20.670 --> 52:21.738
It moves around.

52:22.139 --> 52:25.041
Finding the perfect path
is actually very difficult.

52:25.108 --> 52:27.777
-[Chris] Yes.
-[Tiki] Especially once it starts sinking.

52:28.478 --> 52:31.515
-[Chris] Here we go.
-[Tiki] A slip could be devastating.

52:31.581 --> 52:35.252
As he tries to accumulate
as many points as possible.

52:36.553 --> 52:38.355
[audience cheering]

52:42.559 --> 52:46.396
[Tiki] Oh! He slips! Can he get back
and grab the Hangman?

52:46.463 --> 52:48.431
The Hangman
is where you make your money here.

52:48.765 --> 52:49.599
[Yoann yells]

52:50.333 --> 52:52.569
Seventy-five points available.

52:52.636 --> 52:59.209
It doesn't look like he's going to be able
to gain any ground on Kyle Soderman.

52:59.576 --> 53:01.478
The Americans gotta feel great.

53:03.480 --> 53:04.781
[in French] I'm wet again.

53:06.283 --> 53:07.250
It's hard.

53:07.317 --> 53:09.953
I lost some time.
I didn't want to slip at the start.

53:10.520 --> 53:11.454
But anyway...

53:12.389 --> 53:14.124
Kyle is really good, of course.

53:14.191 --> 53:16.826
I have a lot of respect
for people who train hard

53:16.893 --> 53:20.096
and who achieve
what they set out to do.

53:20.597 --> 53:24.367
[Tiki] Kyle Soderman has
a commanding lead going into Level 4

53:24.734 --> 53:26.536
over Yoann Leroux,

53:26.603 --> 53:32.642
who finishes with 180 points
to Kyle Soderman's 350.

53:33.510 --> 53:36.346
-We're gonna fight it out to the end?
-[in English] Sure. We can do it.

53:36.413 --> 53:39.783
-As always, I still have some.
-France versus USA.

53:39.849 --> 53:42.819
-Let's do it! Let's do it.
-Sounds like a cool final.

53:46.423 --> 53:48.658
[Tiki] The stage is set
and the stakes are high.

53:48.725 --> 53:51.328
These two athletes both know
what they need to do.

53:51.394 --> 53:52.696
[Yoann] 200 points available.

53:52.762 --> 53:55.899
The Thruster is at the top
and I'll get it. I'll fight to the end.

53:56.399 --> 54:00.003
The 200 point Point Thruster is
definitely a little bit of a concern here.

54:00.070 --> 54:03.340
I mean, Yoann definitely could get
up there before me and hit it,

54:03.406 --> 54:05.075
then he could be ahead on points.

54:05.141 --> 54:07.010
But I'm not gonna worry too much.

54:07.077 --> 54:08.245
I'll just get up first.

54:08.945 --> 54:10.347
[Tiki] All right, here we go!

54:10.413 --> 54:11.781
Level 4!

54:12.182 --> 54:14.517
One of these competitors

54:14.584 --> 54:19.222
will win tonight's prize of $10,000,

54:19.289 --> 54:22.926
and, more importantly,
the title of Beastmaster.

54:23.293 --> 54:25.795
Kyle has a 170 point lead.

54:25.862 --> 54:29.332
USA versus France on Level 4 of the Beast.

54:29.399 --> 54:31.034
This is going to be exciting.

54:31.968 --> 54:34.137
[Chris] Yoann Le-Kanga-Roux
looks pretty jacked.

54:34.204 --> 54:37.007
Kyle is a bit thinner,
but that's gonna serve him better.

54:37.073 --> 54:38.908
[Tiki] Yoann is a different kind
of athlete.

54:38.975 --> 54:41.845
Parkour and freerunning
are his specialties.

54:41.911 --> 54:43.613
[Chris] And Yoann is actually divorced,

54:43.680 --> 54:46.616
so I'm hoping emotionally
and mentally, he's weighed down.

54:46.683 --> 54:48.018
[horn sounds]

54:48.084 --> 54:49.719
[Sandy] Go, France!

54:49.786 --> 54:51.588
[Tiki and Chris] USA!

54:51.655 --> 54:55.558
[Tiki] Kyle Soderman
a little bit behind Yoann Leroux.

54:55.625 --> 54:56.793
Come on, Kyle!

54:58.762 --> 55:00.230
Now, as they get to Full Tilt,

55:00.297 --> 55:04.934
these things, these blocks drop about
a foot each time weight is put on them.

55:09.105 --> 55:11.241
[audience cheering]

55:14.044 --> 55:16.313
-Go, Yoann!
-You can make it to the Thrusters.

55:16.379 --> 55:19.649
-Go, go! Push it!
-[Gilles] Push it with your foot!

55:19.716 --> 55:21.718
[Chris] It is a race
to the first Point Thruster!

55:21.785 --> 55:23.753
Come on, Kyle! Get there!

55:23.820 --> 55:26.289
Get it with your foot!
Kick it with your foot!

55:26.356 --> 55:28.158
[Tiki] Neither of them...

55:28.224 --> 55:30.160
They get it simultaneously!

55:30.226 --> 55:33.029
-He did it! France did it!
-France did it!

55:33.463 --> 55:36.866
[Tiki] They're gonna have to go to
the tape to figure out who got that one.

55:37.701 --> 55:41.037
It looks like they hit it
at the same time. I think Kyle got it!

55:41.104 --> 55:43.973
Nailing the Point Thruster with the foot!

55:44.040 --> 55:46.409
[Chris] I think Kyle got that one
by the skin of his feet.

55:46.476 --> 55:47.310
[Tiki laughs]

55:47.377 --> 55:49.446
[Tiki] That's 10 extra points for Kyle.

55:49.512 --> 55:53.383
Now, there are four Point Thrusters
on this last level.

55:53.450 --> 55:55.819
If Kyle hits
all the remaining Point Thrusters,

55:55.885 --> 55:59.089
it will be mathematically impossible
for Yoann to win.

55:59.155 --> 56:03.059
So Yoann's got to get his move on,
and hustle to that next Point Thruster.

56:03.460 --> 56:07.697
They're making their way
up the Motherboard with these little pegs,

56:07.764 --> 56:09.699
and Kyle's got a big lead.

56:09.766 --> 56:12.135
Yoann looks like
he's struggling a little bit,

56:12.202 --> 56:14.637
Kyle is almost at the top
of the Motherboard,

56:14.704 --> 56:16.706
and then he'll go on to Sky Hook.

56:17.040 --> 56:19.309
-[Gilles] No, no!
-[Sandy] No, no, no, no!

56:19.542 --> 56:21.511
[commentators groan]

56:22.045 --> 56:23.313
[Tiki] Yoann is falling down.

56:23.380 --> 56:24.981
-No, no, no, no!
-No!

56:25.048 --> 56:27.817
[Tiki] He's lost his grip
and he's fallen to the bottom.

56:27.884 --> 56:31.588
Now, he is not out of the competition.
He can restart.

56:31.654 --> 56:34.524
But he has a lot of distance to make up.

56:34.924 --> 56:37.994
And Kyle is smart.
He doesn't need to rush right now.

56:38.328 --> 56:42.699
He knows that Yoann
has fallen to the bottom and has to reset,

56:43.199 --> 56:44.434
and Yoann is struggling.

56:44.501 --> 56:47.470
[Chris] You can't take too much time
though, Kyle, you've gotta go.

56:48.271 --> 56:52.208
[Tiki] Kyle has one minute left.
Here he goes with Sky Hook.

56:53.877 --> 56:55.145
Very good!

56:55.645 --> 56:57.380
[Chris] Kyle, ladies and gentlemen,

56:57.447 --> 56:59.916
is dangling 60 feet in the air.

56:59.983 --> 57:01.618
I'm seriously gonna throw up.

57:01.684 --> 57:02.952
I'm so scared of heights.

57:03.019 --> 57:04.654
I don't know how this kid's doing it.

57:06.623 --> 57:09.592
-No, he's coming all the way back down.
-No, no!

57:09.659 --> 57:13.029
[Tiki] It looks like Yoann Leroux
is down to the bottom again.

57:13.096 --> 57:17.200
His hands, his wrists
are lacking for him. It's burning.

57:19.702 --> 57:26.075
To climb the Ventilator, that's 35 feet
to the top for Kyle Soderman,

57:26.776 --> 57:29.579
who looks like he's on his way

57:30.113 --> 57:33.950
to claiming the crown
and the title of Beastmaster.

57:34.017 --> 57:36.219
[Chris] There's a Point Thruster
there as well,

57:36.286 --> 57:38.188
just to really put it out of reach here.

57:39.923 --> 57:43.760
[Tiki and Chris] Ten, nine, eight,

57:43.827 --> 57:48.231
seven, six, five,

57:48.298 --> 57:50.333
four, three,

57:50.400 --> 57:52.669
two, one.

57:52.735 --> 57:56.439
[Chris] Happy Beastmaster, Kyle Soderman!

57:56.506 --> 58:00.510
[Tiki] Kyle did not make it
to the top of Ventilator,

58:00.577 --> 58:04.547
but given his commanding lead
coming into Level 4,

58:04.614 --> 58:09.252
and the fact that Yoann Leroux
couldn't make it through the Motherboard,

58:09.319 --> 58:15.825
Kyle Soderman has won the $10,000
and the title of Beastmaster.

58:16.326 --> 58:21.464
[chanting] USA! USA! USA! USA!

58:22.465 --> 58:24.601
[Tiki] He'll go on to face
the other winners

58:24.667 --> 58:29.172
for a chance to be crowned
the Ultimate Beastmaster.

58:29.239 --> 58:30.340
I'm so pumped!

58:30.406 --> 58:32.542
When I got up there,
I wanted to get to the top.

58:32.609 --> 58:34.277
My time ran out, but that's fine.

58:34.344 --> 58:36.312
I was so jacked getting up there.

58:36.379 --> 58:40.283
$10,000 is mine, I'm about to go
and get that $50,000 next.

58:41.017 --> 58:42.452
[Chris] Greatest invention ever?

58:42.519 --> 58:43.920
Sliced bread is like here.

58:43.987 --> 58:46.322
Netflix autoplay, here.

58:46.689 --> 58:48.892
Stuffed crust pizza, somewhere in between.

58:48.958 --> 58:51.628
[Tiki] More Ultimate Beastmaster, now!

58:51.694 --> 58:57.734
[crowd chanting] Oossaa! Oossaa! Oossaa!
Oossaa! Oossaa! Oossaa! Oossaa!

59:00.570 --> 59:02.572
[the Beast growls]

59:04.040 --> 59:05.408
[theme music playing]
