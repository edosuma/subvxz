00:45.720 --> 00:49.247
<i>Look high in the sky
On this Never Land night</i>

00:49.800 --> 00:54.124
<i>For a glowing, green star
The fourth from the right</i>

00:54.320 --> 00:58.166
<i>As it falls from the heavens
And streaks through the air</i>

00:58.320 --> 01:02.564
<i>You'll know it's a comet
A sight strange and rare</i>

01:02.720 --> 01:05.803
<i>A harmless display?
A treat for the eye?</i>

01:06.240 --> 01:07.401
<i>Perhaps</i>

01:07.480 --> 01:11.087
<i>But be careful
For appearances lie</i>

01:11.640 --> 01:15.326
<i>This comet, you see
Has been here before</i>

01:15.560 --> 01:19.929
<i>The ancients described it
In old fairy lore</i>

01:21.040 --> 01:24.840
<i>"Beware the green tail
As it trails alongside</i>

01:25.040 --> 01:28.840
<i>"And spills into corners
Where shadows abide</i>

01:29.480 --> 01:32.689
<i>"Take heed, and you'll know
That before the dawn breaks</i>

01:32.800 --> 01:36.521
<i>"Deep down in the darkness
Something awakes"</i>

02:04.200 --> 02:06.248
<i>I'm gonna fall</i>

02:07.280 --> 02:12.286
<i>Headfirst and fast like an avalanche</i>

02:12.440 --> 02:14.568
<i>Maybe I'll land</i>

02:15.320 --> 02:16.606
<i>Maybe I'll crash</i>

02:16.680 --> 02:20.241
<i>I will take that chance</i>

02:20.760 --> 02:25.322
<i>'Cause there's nothing but air
in between me and everything</i>

02:25.480 --> 02:29.326
<i>Nothing to keep me
from flying aimlessly</i>

02:29.480 --> 02:33.280
<i>Shamelessly laughing at destiny</i>

02:33.360 --> 02:37.160
<i>And no one knows how high I go</i>

02:37.440 --> 02:41.001
<i>Or what makes the atmosphere glow</i>

02:41.680 --> 02:45.480
<i>I could follow the narrow road</i>

02:45.680 --> 02:48.923
<i>But maybe I'll let it all go</i>

02:49.080 --> 02:53.130
<i>And just float</i>

02:57.520 --> 02:59.761
<i>I'll float</i>

03:01.840 --> 03:03.763
<i>Float</i>

03:11.760 --> 03:13.683
Tink, it's perfect!

03:14.360 --> 03:15.771
Just like you ordered, Fawn.

03:15.960 --> 03:19.203
One extra-large wagon.
But what's it for?

03:19.360 --> 03:21.089
I mean, why all the mystery?

03:21.200 --> 03:23.806
I just love how your mind's
always working.

03:23.920 --> 03:25.285
I can take it from here.

03:25.880 --> 03:28.804
Baby ducklings! Or baby bunnies?

03:29.000 --> 03:30.923
It's a movable nursery, right?

03:31.800 --> 03:32.801
Bull's-eye!

03:32.880 --> 03:34.803
Can't get a thing past you, Tink.

03:34.880 --> 03:37.360
Well, anyway, catch you later.

03:37.640 --> 03:39.324
You're up to something.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.562
Who, me? Never.

03:41.640 --> 03:43.563
Yep, you definitely are.

03:43.880 --> 03:44.881
I know that look.

03:45.160 --> 03:48.403
I invented that look.
What's the wagon for?

03:49.560 --> 03:53.246
Okay, okay. Just try not to scream.

03:53.480 --> 03:54.481
Deal?

04:00.480 --> 04:03.006
No deal. No deal. No deal!

04:04.000 --> 04:05.650
It's okay, Hannah.

04:05.920 --> 04:07.046
Tink's with me.

04:07.480 --> 04:08.641
You have a...

04:08.720 --> 04:09.767
Deep breath in.

04:09.840 --> 04:10.841
...hawk!

04:11.280 --> 04:12.247
Yep.

04:12.320 --> 04:14.607
Fawn, hawks eat fairies!

04:14.680 --> 04:16.284
Adult hawks, yes.

04:16.399 --> 04:18.402
Hannah's still technically a baby.

04:18.560 --> 04:22.565
That whole "must-eat-fairy" urge
hasn't quite kicked in yet.

04:22.640 --> 04:24.404
She doesn't look so babyish to me.

04:24.480 --> 04:26.084
Well, she was when I brought her here.

04:26.200 --> 04:29.329
She had a bad wing,
but I fixed her up and now...

04:32.440 --> 04:33.771
Wing's all better.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.767
You can't have a hawk in Pixie Hollow.

04:36.880 --> 04:38.370
What if the Scouts find out?

04:38.520 --> 04:40.682
That's where the blueberry wagon
comes in!

04:40.800 --> 04:42.802
We just have to get Hannah
out to where she belongs

04:42.880 --> 04:45.087
without causing, you know,

04:45.360 --> 04:46.521
widespread panic.

04:55.040 --> 04:56.121
Good job!

04:56.200 --> 04:57.201
Here you go.

04:57.280 --> 04:58.281
Good.

05:00.560 --> 05:02.164
You're doing great, Hannah.

05:02.280 --> 05:03.930
Hang tight until we're in the clear.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.048
Are you sure about this, Fawn?

05:06.120 --> 05:08.885
Remember, we're just taking berries
to the forest.

05:09.160 --> 05:10.207
Nothing to it.

05:10.280 --> 05:13.807
But don't berries usually come
from the forest?

05:16.240 --> 05:17.730
Everything will be fine.

05:17.800 --> 05:19.290
Just fly casual.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.482
Exactly how often
do you do this kind of thing?

05:24.440 --> 05:25.646
Come on.

05:33.680 --> 05:34.761
Fawn?

05:34.840 --> 05:36.922
Just keep smiling.

05:39.480 --> 05:41.562
See, Tink? I told you this would work.

05:41.720 --> 05:44.724
All you need is a little faith, trust, and...

05:44.920 --> 05:45.887
Pixie dust?

05:45.960 --> 05:47.007
There you are!

05:47.080 --> 05:48.809
We've been looking for you all morning!

05:48.960 --> 05:50.689
Hey, did you guys see
that comet last night?

05:50.760 --> 05:54.606
No, but did you see that big, green ball
of light that flew by?

05:54.800 --> 05:55.881
What's with the berries?

05:56.000 --> 05:57.843
Just bringing them to the forest.

05:58.080 --> 05:59.445
For the animals.

05:59.920 --> 06:02.321
Don't berries come from the forest?

06:03.120 --> 06:04.804
Not this particular variety

06:04.880 --> 06:09.727
which is extra berry-full-licious-tastic!

06:10.040 --> 06:11.530
Yum! Can we help?

06:11.640 --> 06:13.210
No, no, no! We're fine.

06:13.280 --> 06:14.725
Why would we need help?

06:14.800 --> 06:16.006
For goodness' sake.

06:16.120 --> 06:17.849
There's an easier way to do this.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.604
Wait! No, no!
You don't know what you're doing!

06:19.680 --> 06:21.125
It's called "helping."

06:21.960 --> 06:24.531
A simple "thank you" would suffice.

06:25.080 --> 06:27.401
What are you all staring at?

06:41.320 --> 06:42.321
Hawk!

06:50.080 --> 06:53.004
That comet is an astronomical puzzle,
to be sure,

06:53.080 --> 06:56.084
but careful observation
and application...

07:06.360 --> 07:07.361
Hannah!

07:08.040 --> 07:10.088
Hannah, stop! Come back!

07:10.680 --> 07:11.920
Everyone, get inside!

07:16.600 --> 07:17.681
Iridessa!

07:23.040 --> 07:24.087
Oh, no!

07:28.680 --> 07:30.011
Nyx?

08:09.960 --> 08:11.962
Hannah? Hannah!

08:13.440 --> 08:15.249
Go! Get inside! Hurry!

08:15.720 --> 08:16.721
Go!

08:18.320 --> 08:19.367
Come on!

08:59.960 --> 09:02.770
Wait! Everybody calm down!

09:02.840 --> 09:06.481
I promise, she doesn't even like
the taste of Scout Fairy.

09:06.720 --> 09:09.166
Babies are such picky eaters.

09:10.960 --> 09:13.361
It's okay, Hannah.
Everything's going to be all right.

09:13.560 --> 09:15.130
Get away from the hawk, Fawn.

09:15.480 --> 09:16.891
Let us handle this.

09:16.960 --> 09:18.530
There's nothing to handle, Nyx.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.523
I said stand down, Fawn.

09:20.600 --> 09:22.284
Is everyone all right?

09:23.520 --> 09:26.444
Yes, Queen Clarion, this time.

09:28.920 --> 09:30.445
But how am I supposed to keep us safe

09:30.520 --> 09:33.967
if Fawn keeps bringing dangerous
animals into Pixie Hollow?

09:34.240 --> 09:36.561
Last time it was rats, and a snake!

09:36.880 --> 09:38.882
Actually, last time, it was a vampire bat.

09:38.960 --> 09:41.486
Fawn's just got a big heart, that's all.

09:41.760 --> 09:43.285
Hannah needed her help.

09:43.520 --> 09:47.241
Does this look like the face
of a dangerous predator to you?

09:49.120 --> 09:51.009
Come on, back me up, guys!

09:53.520 --> 09:55.124
- Fawn...
- I know, I know.

09:55.320 --> 09:56.367
Nyx is right.

09:56.440 --> 09:59.922
I've done this once or twice,
or several times before.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.126
Yes.

10:01.200 --> 10:05.285
However, perhaps my latest endeavor
was crossing the line.

10:05.360 --> 10:06.964
- Indeed.
- I hear what you're saying.

10:07.040 --> 10:10.601
Maybe harboring a baby hawk
wasn't the best idea.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.729
Fawn, I know you.

10:12.920 --> 10:14.922
You've always let your heart guide you.

10:15.160 --> 10:16.969
Which is admirable, but...

10:17.120 --> 10:19.521
But I also need to listen with my head.

10:22.920 --> 10:25.730
Next time, I promise, I will.

10:30.720 --> 10:33.485
Well, Hannah-Banana,
I'd say come back and visit,

10:33.560 --> 10:37.246
but it's probably best to keep this
a long-distance thing.

10:37.480 --> 10:40.370
Now, let's give that wing a try.

10:57.960 --> 10:59.928
Good morning, students!

11:00.000 --> 11:02.890
Beautiful day for a fresh start,
don't you think?

11:03.040 --> 11:05.646
All right, then, let's see that hopping.

11:06.240 --> 11:08.322
Nice work, Nico.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.090
Perfection, Paige!

11:11.440 --> 11:15.081
Calista, remember it's hopping,
not walking.

11:17.160 --> 11:18.605
What, haven't you heard?

11:18.720 --> 11:20.370
I'm strictly by-the-book now.

11:20.520 --> 11:23.888
Yep, we're talking model citizen
all the way.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.401
Looking for the definition
of responsibility?

11:27.560 --> 11:30.404
Look no further than this girl!

11:37.080 --> 11:39.765
Well, that was interesting.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.211
Now, that's hopping.

11:54.920 --> 11:56.251
Hello?

12:57.960 --> 13:00.247
Come on, Fawn, listen to your head.

13:00.400 --> 13:03.370
Heart gets you in trouble,
head is your friend.

13:04.120 --> 13:07.249
And yet, head is making me
talk to myself,

13:07.400 --> 13:08.447
out loud,

13:08.520 --> 13:09.931
in the forest.

13:10.200 --> 13:12.362
No, no, no. Model citizen.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.245
Starting first thing tomorrow.

13:52.200 --> 13:53.929
What are you?

14:56.640 --> 14:59.246
Okay, think.
Territorial, possibly carnivorous.

14:59.320 --> 15:01.209
Unspeakably big!

15:01.320 --> 15:02.560
What to do? What to do?

15:02.640 --> 15:04.005
Play dead!

15:04.920 --> 15:06.604
No, no. Freeze.

15:07.600 --> 15:09.841
No, the opposite! Make myself look big!

15:22.320 --> 15:23.845
What was that?

15:58.840 --> 15:59.921
Did you hear it?

16:00.080 --> 16:01.161
Hear what?

16:01.240 --> 16:02.366
The roar!

16:02.480 --> 16:05.051
Did you hear the roar?

16:06.040 --> 16:08.247
Sorry, did you say something?

16:10.040 --> 16:11.371
You bet I heard it.

16:11.520 --> 16:12.567
Little faster.

16:12.720 --> 16:15.485
Visualize the acorn right in front of you.

16:15.560 --> 16:17.289
Excellent. What was it?

16:17.560 --> 16:21.326
No idea. But let me know
as soon as you find out.

16:21.720 --> 16:23.404
Gently, now. To the left.

16:23.920 --> 16:25.081
No, the other left!

16:28.240 --> 16:29.241
That roar...

16:29.320 --> 16:31.163
- This morning?
- What was it?

16:31.240 --> 16:33.766
I don't know. I don't specialize in roars.

16:33.880 --> 16:35.769
Now, grunts and growls,
on the other hand...

16:35.840 --> 16:36.841
Who would know?

16:37.000 --> 16:38.684
Well, if it came from anything big...

16:38.760 --> 16:40.649
- Loud“.
- Scary...

16:40.720 --> 16:42.609
And dangerous, try...

16:42.840 --> 16:44.171
Fawn.

18:00.720 --> 18:01.960
Come on, big guy.

18:02.200 --> 18:03.486
Over here.

18:44.360 --> 18:45.930
Wait! I was only trying to help!

19:05.440 --> 19:08.569
So, I guess I'll just be on my way, then.

19:15.040 --> 19:17.884
Those thick forelimbs
are ideal for digging.

19:18.040 --> 19:19.121
Nope. No, no, no.

19:19.200 --> 19:22.124
You're all fixed up, so off I go!

19:23.120 --> 19:27.808
And that massive jaw is perfect
for supporting those heavy rocks.

19:28.280 --> 19:29.930
Okay. Sorry, sorry.

19:30.080 --> 19:31.445
Just leaving.

19:32.800 --> 19:35.485
But, you know,
it's like you're a cross between

19:35.560 --> 19:39.007
<i>Didelphis marsupialis</i>
and <i>Bison occidentalis...</i>

19:42.000 --> 19:43.365
That spits.

19:43.520 --> 19:45.045
Well, I don't know what that's about.

19:46.440 --> 19:49.011
And I don't know what that's about.

19:52.480 --> 19:56.326
I really don't know what that's about.
What are you building?

19:56.480 --> 19:59.802
You know, it is my job
as an Animal Fairy

19:59.880 --> 20:02.042
to understand and study animals.

20:02.120 --> 20:04.805
And the Queen did say
I should listen to my head.

20:08.560 --> 20:09.686
You've convinced me.

20:09.800 --> 20:12.485
I'll do it, for the Queen.

20:14.200 --> 20:15.565
Now stay here, okay?

20:15.640 --> 20:17.768
I'll be right back.
I just need to get my stuff.

20:17.880 --> 20:18.927
Don't go anywhere.

20:19.320 --> 20:20.765
Just stay.

20:20.960 --> 20:22.485
Stay.

20:24.440 --> 20:25.601
Stay.

20:35.120 --> 20:36.121
Fawn.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.161
Nyx.

20:38.840 --> 20:41.525
I've been looking everywhere for you.
So, where have you been?

20:41.680 --> 20:42.841
Off hiding a hippo?

20:43.000 --> 20:45.162
Yep, he's bunking with the bobcat.

20:45.320 --> 20:47.800
Did you hear that roar this morning?

20:49.160 --> 20:52.403
Can you describe the roar in question?
What kind of roar was it?

20:52.520 --> 20:55.205
The loud, hair-raising, monstrous kind.

20:55.280 --> 20:56.725
Animals make all kinds of roars.

20:56.800 --> 21:01.283
I mean, you've got your growls, howls,
whoops, hollers, shrieks, rumbles.

21:01.640 --> 21:03.529
Was it like this?

21:04.680 --> 21:06.205
No. A roar.

21:06.840 --> 21:07.841
Sort of like...

21:09.080 --> 21:10.161
No.

21:10.720 --> 21:11.721
No!

21:12.040 --> 21:13.041
No!

21:16.680 --> 21:17.920
Fawn!

21:18.360 --> 21:20.681
Yeah. If you hear that one, run.

21:20.800 --> 21:21.801
Would you hand me that?

21:24.360 --> 21:28.001
Look, this thing
might be a threat to Pixie Hollow.

21:28.160 --> 21:32.210
If you find out what made that roar,
I need to know.

21:32.320 --> 21:33.606
Are we clear?

21:34.360 --> 21:36.010
What will you do if you find it?

21:37.880 --> 21:39.405
My Job.

21:41.040 --> 21:42.644
And I'll do mine.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.608
<i>Strange sight</i>

21:53.720 --> 21:55.688
<i>You stand in the light</i>

21:55.840 --> 21:59.925
<i>You're wrong but you're right
My heart's beating wildly</i>

22:00.720 --> 22:04.645
<i>Strange how I'm scared
but delighted</i>

22:04.760 --> 22:07.366
<i>Afraid, but excited, too</i>

22:08.560 --> 22:10.961
<i>You have a cold heart</i>

22:11.080 --> 22:15.369
<i>You're reckless and distant,
but I'll be persistent</i>

22:15.560 --> 22:17.722
<i>- I will understand you</i>
- Hello?

22:17.800 --> 22:19.723
<i>Strange</i>

22:19.800 --> 22:24.283
<i>How I'm drawn to the danger
I reach out my hands to you</i>

22:26.080 --> 22:30.085
<i>Do you long to be left all alone?</i>

22:30.280 --> 22:34.046
<i>Set apart with a heart
made of stone</i>

22:34.560 --> 22:38.326
<i>Let me help, let's begin
Let me learn</i>

22:38.400 --> 22:40.004
<i>Won't you let me in?</i>

22:40.080 --> 22:41.491
<i>All the light</i>

22:41.600 --> 22:43.443
<i>Let it show</i>

22:43.520 --> 22:46.126
<i>You are a strange sight</i>

22:46.200 --> 22:48.043
<i>Some new kind of wonder</i>

22:48.120 --> 22:50.282
<i>With good hidden under</i>

22:50.440 --> 22:52.363
<i>I'm sure that it's true</i>

22:52.960 --> 22:56.806
<i>Strange how your dark
doesn't faze me</i>

22:57.000 --> 22:59.924
<i>No, I won't give up on you</i>

23:00.920 --> 23:04.163
<i>Do you long to be left all alone?</i>

23:05.320 --> 23:09.609
<i>Set apart with a heart
made of stone</i>

23:09.760 --> 23:11.888
<i>Let me help, let's begin</i>

23:11.960 --> 23:13.450
<i>Let me learn</i>

23:13.520 --> 23:15.249
<i>Won't you let me in?</i>

23:15.320 --> 23:18.005
<i>All the light, let it show</i>

23:18.440 --> 23:22.729
<i>If you're caught in the shadows
and turned all around</i>

23:23.320 --> 23:27.405
<i>Lost in the darkness
you will be found</i>

23:27.480 --> 23:29.448
<i>If you hear my voice</i>

23:29.520 --> 23:31.841
<i>Follow the sound</i>

23:31.960 --> 23:35.407
<i>'Cause I'm here to guide you home</i>

23:35.960 --> 23:39.726
<i>Do you long to be left all alone?</i>

23:40.320 --> 23:44.530
<i>Set apart with a heart
made of stone</i>

23:44.720 --> 23:46.643
<i>Let me help, let's begin</i>

23:46.840 --> 23:48.444
<i>Let me learn</i>

23:48.520 --> 23:50.443
<i>Won't you let me in?</i>

23:50.520 --> 23:53.364
<i>All the light, let it show</i>

23:53.560 --> 23:57.326
<i>Do you long to be left all alone?</i>

23:58.400 --> 24:02.371
<i>Set apart with a heart
made of stone</i>

24:03.160 --> 24:05.561
<i>There's a light that you shine</i>

24:05.640 --> 24:07.051
<i>There's a love</i>

24:07.120 --> 24:10.408
<i>I see it in your eyes
All the dark</i>

24:10.800 --> 24:13.041
<i>Let it go</i>

24:14.560 --> 24:17.928
<i>You're not alone</i>

24:26.720 --> 24:29.530
I cleaned out the skunk pen yesterday.

24:36.280 --> 24:37.850
Good morning!

24:45.520 --> 24:47.602
Looks like somebody's a night owl.

24:52.600 --> 24:54.329
What is this?

24:56.560 --> 24:57.641
Okay.

24:59.040 --> 25:00.201
So, where to?

25:00.360 --> 25:02.169
Anywhere but Scout Headquarters.

25:02.240 --> 25:03.890
Look, if I'm gonna cover for you,

25:03.960 --> 25:06.566
I need to know, what's the tower for?

25:06.640 --> 25:08.927
This one beaver I know, Bob...
Great guy!

25:09.000 --> 25:11.685
He makes dams big enough
to store food for three winters.

25:11.760 --> 25:14.445
And, of course,
marmots build these terrific burrows

25:14.520 --> 25:15.806
out of rock piles for hibernation.

25:15.880 --> 25:18.690
Then you've got your northern orioles
and those hanging nests of theirs.

25:18.760 --> 25:20.842
I mean, talk about brilliant!

25:20.920 --> 25:23.730
But I'm thinking you're not storing food.

25:23.800 --> 25:25.290
Or preparing for hibernation.

25:25.440 --> 25:26.930
Or nesting.

25:27.400 --> 25:28.401
Seriously,

25:28.480 --> 25:29.766
what's the tower for?

25:31.320 --> 25:33.766
You don't have to be so gruff about it.

25:34.600 --> 25:36.284
That's it. "Gruff!"

25:36.480 --> 25:39.086
Yep, "Gruff" suits you to a...

25:44.480 --> 25:46.289
Guess we're building another one.

25:48.640 --> 25:51.723
But before we start, I was just thinking,

25:51.800 --> 25:54.451
why not enjoy yourself a bit
while you work?

25:58.040 --> 25:59.371
Just hear me out.

25:59.440 --> 26:03.490
No reason I should have all the fun
with the pixie dust.

26:07.360 --> 26:08.646
Come on!

26:15.680 --> 26:17.250
Now we're talking.

26:39.720 --> 26:41.768
Fairies and Sparrowmen,

26:41.840 --> 26:44.810
presenting the three-time
defending champion

26:44.880 --> 26:47.804
of the Pixie Hollow Games
Tower-Building event,

26:47.880 --> 26:52.249
the amazing, incomparable, Gruff.

26:52.920 --> 26:55.287
Will he hold off this year's pint-sized,

26:55.360 --> 26:57.601
yet feisty challenger?

27:08.160 --> 27:09.650
And he nails it!

27:09.720 --> 27:12.485
But it's too much! The fairy wins!

27:12.560 --> 27:13.846
The fairy...

27:16.160 --> 27:17.286
Oh, no.

27:17.880 --> 27:19.245
And done.

27:19.400 --> 27:20.606
This may be our best spring yet.

27:20.760 --> 27:22.250
Incoming!

27:32.240 --> 27:33.969
Oh, no.

27:39.760 --> 27:41.683
The boulders came from that direction?

27:41.760 --> 27:42.727
Affirmative.

27:42.800 --> 27:44.325
If Fawn hadn't shouted that warning,

27:44.600 --> 27:46.250
we'd be flatter than a pumpkin seed.

27:46.320 --> 27:48.129
Two pumpkin seeds!

27:49.080 --> 27:50.241
Fawn?

27:50.560 --> 27:54.042
Hey, Gruff, I think it's time
we make like a tree and lea...

28:00.440 --> 28:02.363
Come on, Gruff, where are you?

28:08.360 --> 28:10.408
Gruff! No time for rock collecting!

28:10.600 --> 28:11.965
You've got to get out of here!

28:15.120 --> 28:16.121
Gruff!

28:19.760 --> 28:20.807
Nyx.

28:25.080 --> 28:26.969
Snodgrass.

28:33.040 --> 28:34.644
No, Gruff! Wrong way!

28:34.720 --> 28:36.131
We have to go!

28:36.360 --> 28:37.771
Okay. New game, Gruff.

28:37.880 --> 28:39.882
It's called Chase the Fairy!

28:41.000 --> 28:42.650
Now, follow me!

28:56.320 --> 28:58.209
Knock it out with
the Nightshade powder!

30:50.360 --> 30:52.840
That's my big, furry monster.

30:54.120 --> 30:57.249
Maybe it's time to make
proper introductions.

30:59.120 --> 31:00.531
Interesting.

31:00.960 --> 31:03.486
35.25 miles to the right.

31:03.560 --> 31:04.561
Fascinating.

31:05.040 --> 31:07.884
Get me every animal volume
you have in here, immediately.

31:08.040 --> 31:09.041
Please.

31:09.120 --> 31:11.885
I'm in the middle of
a high-level, special, royal project.

31:12.040 --> 31:13.280
Did I say "royal"?

31:13.520 --> 31:15.284
Top secret...

31:16.320 --> 31:17.446
Hello.

31:18.120 --> 31:19.849
How may I help you?

31:23.640 --> 31:25.802
And this is just the "A's."

31:25.960 --> 31:28.042
You know, books are a workout
for the brains

31:28.560 --> 31:29.800
and the biceps.

31:40.640 --> 31:41.721
And so I said...

31:41.800 --> 31:43.609
"Listen QC, Clar',

31:43.760 --> 31:46.684
"most Sparrowmen couldn't stomach
this kind of pressure,

31:46.800 --> 31:48.928
"but then again,
I'm not most Sparrowmen.

31:49.000 --> 31:52.163
"And besides, that mysterious green
comet isn't going to analyze itself."

31:53.840 --> 31:56.161
Tell me everything you know about this.

31:56.320 --> 31:57.481
Everything.

31:57.600 --> 31:59.045
Over dinner?

32:00.000 --> 32:01.081
Okay, I see.

32:01.160 --> 32:03.606
I've misread the situation entirely,
haven't I?

32:04.320 --> 32:06.163
We'll always have the "A's."

32:08.120 --> 32:11.090
First, thank you guys so much
for meeting me here.

32:11.160 --> 32:13.162
I'm sure you're wondering
what this is about.

32:13.240 --> 32:15.288
Whatever it is, it better be good.

32:15.360 --> 32:17.124
I was mid-exfoliation.

32:17.360 --> 32:19.362
Mid-exfoliation!

32:19.680 --> 32:22.331
So, as you know,
I really learned my lesson

32:22.400 --> 32:25.210
about being smarter
when it comes to dangerous animals.

32:25.280 --> 32:27.044
- We know.
- Honey, you are doing great!

32:27.120 --> 32:28.804
Yeah, you're doing really good.

32:28.880 --> 32:29.881
However...

32:30.200 --> 32:31.725
And here we go.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.126
Fawn?

32:33.400 --> 32:36.290
Ladies, say hello to Gruff!

32:40.040 --> 32:41.166
Oh, no.

32:42.680 --> 32:44.250
Hi, Gruff.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.525
What is that?

32:47.680 --> 32:49.011
I actually don't know.

32:49.400 --> 32:52.085
I've never seen
any animal like him before.

32:53.560 --> 32:54.891
Even

32:56.720 --> 32:58.290
What does he eat?

32:58.360 --> 32:59.600
Not fairies.

32:59.720 --> 33:00.926
Well, that's a relief.

33:01.240 --> 33:04.210
So, I'm gonna take him to the Queen
and show her he's harmless.

33:04.480 --> 33:08.041
Then I'll tell her how he destroyed
Sunflower Meadow.

33:08.120 --> 33:10.088
Well, how I destroyed...

33:10.160 --> 33:11.969
You know what?
Maybe it was both of us.

33:12.040 --> 33:14.202
You guys destroyed
Sunflower Meadow?

33:15.560 --> 33:16.766
He did it.

33:18.360 --> 33:20.408
It was an accident, okay?

33:22.120 --> 33:24.521
And what do you call that?

33:25.560 --> 33:28.769
Again, I don't exactly know.
But I'm working on it.

33:28.960 --> 33:31.804
I'm hearing a lot of "I don't knows"
in this conversation.

33:32.200 --> 33:34.362
Uncertainty makes me uncomfortable.

33:34.600 --> 33:37.888
Come on!
Have I ever put you guys in danger?

33:37.960 --> 33:39.007
- Yes.
- Sure.

33:39.120 --> 33:40.121
- Frequently.
- Yeah.

33:40.200 --> 33:41.770
I still can't sit up straight.

33:41.840 --> 33:43.126
Hawk!

33:43.200 --> 33:45.089
Oh, yeah.

33:45.240 --> 33:48.722
The point is, I want to do
the responsible thing this time.

33:48.960 --> 33:50.450
Just like I promised.

33:50.760 --> 33:53.491
I'm guessing you already have
a plan in mind?

33:53.680 --> 33:56.331
"Operation Gruff-a-Go-Go!"

34:14.120 --> 34:15.565
Open up, big guy.

34:17.960 --> 34:19.563
My skin is gonna break out.

34:20.159 --> 34:22.639
Okay, so I'll go in and set the stage.

34:22.880 --> 34:26.804
Then, on my signal, get him in position,
and I'll bring her out.

34:27.360 --> 34:28.440
Don't worry.

34:28.520 --> 34:30.010
She's gonna love you.

34:33.400 --> 34:34.481
Here I go!

34:34.560 --> 34:36.483
Model citizen, all the way!

34:36.920 --> 34:38.001
- Good luck!
- Be brave!

34:38.080 --> 34:39.127
You can do it, sugar!

34:39.920 --> 34:41.888
She's doomed.

34:42.480 --> 34:45.643
Queen Clarion, I've been thinking
about what you said.

34:45.719 --> 34:47.529
Which is why I'm here to tell you that...

34:47.920 --> 34:48.920
I...

34:49.480 --> 34:52.085
You know what?
It can wait. I'll come back.

34:52.239 --> 34:54.322
Fawn, I'm glad you're here.

34:54.639 --> 34:55.846
So am I.

34:56.120 --> 34:59.124
Nyx has discovered
a dangerous animal in Pixie Hollow.

34:59.280 --> 35:01.851
We could really use your expertise.

35:05.120 --> 35:07.851
I am on the verge
of perspiring over here.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.570
Do you see the signal?

35:09.640 --> 35:11.722
I had my first direct sighting
earlier today.

35:12.200 --> 35:14.806
This is no ordinary predator
we're talking about.

35:15.280 --> 35:19.171
It's bigger and faster
than anything we've ever seen.

35:19.320 --> 35:22.767
I combed through every animal text
in the library and came up empty.

35:22.960 --> 35:26.328
But it turns out,
I was looking in the wrong pl...

35:32.720 --> 35:33.881
Back to the forest!

35:34.080 --> 35:35.161
What?

35:35.240 --> 35:37.402
Mission abort! Mission abort!

35:37.600 --> 35:40.922
That comet that went by the other night,
it was here before.

35:41.320 --> 35:43.641
972 years ago.

35:43.720 --> 35:47.725
And each time it passes
it wakes the creature.

35:50.240 --> 35:51.480
What is this?

35:51.640 --> 35:54.291
This is the NeverBeast.

35:54.560 --> 35:58.281
Once the comet brings it
out of hibernation, it starts building.

35:59.080 --> 36:00.491
Four rock towers.

36:00.640 --> 36:03.166
One in each season of Pixie Hollow.

36:03.320 --> 36:05.004
Green clouds fill the sky.

36:05.120 --> 36:07.202
The creature transforms.

36:07.280 --> 36:08.327
And then,

36:08.400 --> 36:12.724
a lightning storm so powerful,
it consumes all of Pixie Hollow.

36:17.480 --> 36:20.290
- Back home.
- Come on, Gruff.

36:20.880 --> 36:24.771
If we don't act fast,
this storm will destroy us all.

36:24.920 --> 36:26.888
How do we really know this is true

36:26.960 --> 36:31.124
and not just some crazy legend
or misunderstanding?

36:33.280 --> 36:34.441
On three!

36:34.520 --> 36:37.603
One, two, three!

36:46.400 --> 36:48.767
I should get that checked out.

36:53.800 --> 36:54.961
That's odd.

37:00.800 --> 37:02.290
My mouth was open!

37:02.360 --> 37:03.964
It's always open.

37:04.040 --> 37:06.805
Guys! Guys, now is our chance! Quick!

37:10.760 --> 37:13.764
Look, animals do not control
the weather.

37:13.880 --> 37:15.564
Ordinary animals don't.

37:15.640 --> 37:19.850
Furthermore, this creature,
with the horns and the bat wings.

37:20.040 --> 37:23.328
An animal that big couldn't possibly fly

37:23.800 --> 37:26.121
under his own power.

37:31.760 --> 37:34.286
Bottom line,
either we capture the NeverBeast

37:34.360 --> 37:36.931
or life as we know it is over.

37:37.080 --> 37:40.766
Nyx, let's not do anything rash
until we know more.

37:40.920 --> 37:43.366
See if you can locate the creature first.

37:44.360 --> 37:45.771
Yes, Queen Clarion.

37:45.840 --> 37:47.968
I just don't want innocent animals
to get hurt.

37:48.080 --> 37:50.731
And I don't want innocent fairies
to get hurt.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.684
I'm not the enemy here.

37:52.920 --> 37:55.844
Both of you are conscientious
and talented fairies.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.240
And I trust you,

37:57.320 --> 37:58.287
both of you,

37:58.360 --> 38:00.931
to do what's right for Pixie Hollow.

38:02.640 --> 38:03.607
What's the word?

38:03.680 --> 38:05.444
She trusts me to do the right thing.

38:05.520 --> 38:06.521
Which is?

38:06.600 --> 38:08.728
We go after it at dawn.

38:14.560 --> 38:15.561
What happened?

38:15.640 --> 38:17.085
You were supposed
to get him out of here.

38:17.160 --> 38:18.525
We tried, sug.

38:18.600 --> 38:19.965
Giant thing wouldn't budge.

38:20.040 --> 38:22.725
I think he didn't want to leave you.

38:29.920 --> 38:31.922
I missed you too, Gruff.

38:32.160 --> 38:34.845
Sorry to break whatever this is up.

38:34.920 --> 38:37.207
But what happened
to doing the right thing?

38:37.280 --> 38:38.645
Nyx got there first.

38:38.800 --> 38:39.926
And?

38:42.600 --> 38:43.601
And...

38:45.320 --> 38:47.322
Nyx found this harebrained legend

38:47.400 --> 38:49.164
about a creature called
the "NeverBeast"

38:49.240 --> 38:53.325
who builds rock towers and shoots
lightning to destroy Pixie Hollow.

38:53.400 --> 38:56.722
So now she thinks
he's some kind of monster.

39:00.160 --> 39:02.561
I know. Crazy, right?

39:06.160 --> 39:08.049
Well, early day tomorrow.

39:08.120 --> 39:09.281
Am I tired!

39:09.400 --> 39:10.970
Really? I'm wide awake.

39:11.040 --> 39:12.007
Bye-bye, now.

39:12.120 --> 39:13.610
Come on, guys.

39:13.680 --> 39:16.251
You don't really think
any of that stuff is true.

39:18.560 --> 39:21.769
It's just, I know he's not
what they say he is.

39:24.280 --> 39:27.489
Even if you're right,
it's not safe for him here.

39:58.040 --> 40:00.327
Hey, big guy. Done for the day?

40:01.560 --> 40:02.641
Rest up,

40:02.760 --> 40:04.330
because first thing tomorrow,

40:04.440 --> 40:06.727
we're gonna find
someplace great for you.

40:07.160 --> 40:09.322
Just until things settle down.

40:10.600 --> 40:12.887
Gruff, you see those stars over there?

40:13.040 --> 40:15.964
If you connect them,
they make a monkey.

40:16.360 --> 40:17.486
See his tail?

40:18.440 --> 40:21.967
But if you turn it upside down,
it's a swan.

40:22.360 --> 40:23.486
See?

40:24.440 --> 40:25.771
That one's a squirrel.

40:25.840 --> 40:27.410
And over there, with the spikes?

40:27.560 --> 40:29.688
Hedgehog! See it?

40:32.920 --> 40:34.524
I knew you'd get it.

40:34.800 --> 40:37.451
You just have to know how to look.

40:39.920 --> 40:42.890
Imagine. You, a monster.

40:43.280 --> 40:45.601
Of all the ridiculous ideas.

40:47.080 --> 40:49.242
I know they're wrong about you.

40:53.200 --> 40:55.202
They don't see what I see.

41:23.680 --> 41:24.727
Gruff?

41:26.920 --> 41:28.160
Gruff?

41:41.880 --> 41:43.609
It's starting.

41:48.920 --> 41:50.001
What is that?

41:50.080 --> 41:51.081
It's so green.

41:51.160 --> 41:53.049
I've never seen anything like that.

42:01.360 --> 42:02.441
Gruff?

42:02.720 --> 42:04.722
Gruff? Come on, Gruff.

42:04.800 --> 42:07.371
It's "chase" the fairy,
not "run away" from her.

42:07.440 --> 42:08.441
Fawn!

42:09.120 --> 42:12.044
The Scouts, they were geared up
and moving fast.

42:12.120 --> 42:14.043
Please tell me
you took him away already.

42:14.160 --> 42:15.207
About that.

42:15.280 --> 42:18.409
I sort of, temporarily, misplaced him.

42:18.480 --> 42:19.891
You lost him?

42:19.960 --> 42:21.007
I got this.

42:21.080 --> 42:23.401
I just have to find him
before the Scouts do.

42:23.840 --> 42:26.047
Wait! He's going to build
two more towers.

42:26.120 --> 42:28.043
One in Autumn, one in Winter.

42:28.120 --> 42:30.726
I thought you said
the legend wasn't real.

42:30.920 --> 42:34.367
Technically,
I said he's not what they think.

42:34.440 --> 42:37.728
But everything Nyx warned us about,
it's happening.

42:37.840 --> 42:39.729
The clouds are green!

42:39.800 --> 42:42.246
Look, it doesn't matter
what Nyx's legend says.

42:42.320 --> 42:45.244
All I know is, Gruff would never hurt us.

42:45.880 --> 42:48.247
Please, Tink, trust me.

42:51.080 --> 42:52.161
I'll take Winter.

42:53.920 --> 42:54.967
Hey, Tink!

42:56.320 --> 42:57.731
Thanks.

43:42.560 --> 43:44.847
Gruff? Gruff?

44:00.680 --> 44:02.569
Just like the other two.

44:02.840 --> 44:04.649
Just like the drawing.

44:05.200 --> 44:06.281
Over here!

44:08.240 --> 44:10.402
It's headed towards Summer.

44:41.400 --> 44:42.890
Gruff?

44:58.920 --> 45:00.570
Gruff! There you are.

45:00.800 --> 45:02.882
We've been looking everywhere for you.

45:11.080 --> 45:14.129
Gruff, it's me, Tink! Fawn's friend!

45:14.320 --> 45:17.130
The Scouts are coming for you.
You have to hide!

45:19.480 --> 45:20.481
Gruff?

45:28.680 --> 45:29.841
Tink!

45:31.680 --> 45:33.091
Tink?

45:34.320 --> 45:35.970
What did you do?

45:58.720 --> 46:00.165
No.

46:38.240 --> 46:39.321
Help!

46:40.200 --> 46:41.281
Help!

46:44.080 --> 46:45.127
Nyx!

46:59.600 --> 47:01.204
Is she gonna be okay?

47:01.640 --> 47:04.962
She needs to rest,
stay off her wings for a few days.

47:06.360 --> 47:07.327
She'll be all right.

47:07.400 --> 47:09.368
- Thank goodness.
- That's a relief.

47:09.440 --> 47:11.841
See, Fawn, she's gonna be...

47:12.600 --> 47:13.840
Fawn?

47:29.280 --> 47:30.281
Gruff?

47:31.640 --> 47:33.051
Come down.

47:33.840 --> 47:35.604
I need to see you.

47:48.680 --> 47:49.761
Gruff?

48:09.360 --> 48:10.441
Stand firm!

48:18.120 --> 48:19.246
Nightshade powder!

48:44.440 --> 48:46.283
Steady! Hold your ground!

49:10.200 --> 49:11.770
Let's move it out!

49:28.480 --> 49:30.369
You did the right thing.

50:00.960 --> 50:03.645
- Everyone get inside. Hurry!
- This way! Hurry!

50:03.840 --> 50:05.365
Come on, Calista.

50:09.800 --> 50:11.404
- Get inside!
- Scribble, get inside!

50:11.480 --> 50:12.766
- Fly away!
- Get out of here!

50:12.840 --> 50:15.366
At least I loved once.

50:23.680 --> 50:26.047
Whatever this is,
it should have stopped by now.

50:26.120 --> 50:27.360
Just stick to the plan.

50:27.440 --> 50:30.205
Immobilize the NeverBeast,
and the storm disappears.

50:33.720 --> 50:35.290
Does the storm know the plan?

50:35.360 --> 50:38.045
Get everyone to cover
until this blows over.

50:50.880 --> 50:52.291
Help us!

51:02.720 --> 51:03.881
Get to the shelter!

51:04.000 --> 51:05.081
Move!

51:05.160 --> 51:06.844
And secure the doors!

51:27.520 --> 51:30.683
Stop this! I order you, stop this now!

51:48.040 --> 51:49.246
Do you need anything else?

51:49.360 --> 51:50.646
Bring some extra bandages.

51:50.840 --> 51:52.968
Tink. We need to get to the shelter.

51:53.040 --> 51:54.246
It's not safe here.

51:54.320 --> 51:55.845
I have to find Fawn.

51:55.920 --> 51:56.967
Tink!

51:57.040 --> 51:58.485
Fawn.

52:00.360 --> 52:03.284
It's over. He can't hurt you anymore.

52:03.360 --> 52:04.441
Gruff?

52:04.520 --> 52:07.649
He's exactly what Nyx said he was,
a monster.

52:07.720 --> 52:08.881
No, Fawn.

52:08.960 --> 52:10.610
He's my hero.

52:12.800 --> 52:13.881
<i>When I found him in Winter,</i>

52:14.560 --> 52:16.403
<i>he was acting really strange.</i>

52:18.400 --> 52:20.448
Gruff, it's me, Tink!

52:20.920 --> 52:22.126
Fawn's friend!

52:22.240 --> 52:24.846
The Scouts are coming for you.
You have to hide!

52:26.680 --> 52:27.886
Gruff?

52:35.680 --> 52:40.129
<i>If he hadn't pushed me away,
I would've been crushed by the tree.</i>

52:42.800 --> 52:44.165
I could have been killed.

52:44.280 --> 52:45.566
Or worse.

52:46.160 --> 52:48.242
He was protecting you.

52:48.600 --> 52:50.045
He saved my life.

52:50.840 --> 52:52.251
And I betrayed him.

53:01.320 --> 53:02.606
Where are you going?

53:03.320 --> 53:05.288
To do the right thing.

53:13.600 --> 53:16.331
Hang tight, Gruff!
We're getting you out of here!

53:18.200 --> 53:19.565
We need help.

53:19.640 --> 53:21.130
Pull harder!

53:21.200 --> 53:24.682
For goodness' sake,
there is an easier way to do this.

53:27.120 --> 53:28.201
Thank you.

53:32.280 --> 53:33.645
Go! Take cover!

53:34.240 --> 53:35.730
Come on, Gruff!

53:37.920 --> 53:39.331
Gruff, let's go!

53:40.800 --> 53:41.801
Gruff?

53:45.240 --> 53:46.890
- Come on, Fawn!
- Get out of there!

53:46.960 --> 53:48.803
Life or death moment, here!

53:50.280 --> 53:51.247
Listen to me.

53:51.320 --> 53:53.561
You're having a reaction
to the Nightshade.

54:01.600 --> 54:03.045
You can see my glow!

54:06.880 --> 54:09.611
Don't worry, Gruff.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.207
Well, I did not see that coming.

54:34.280 --> 54:35.850
Nyx got it backwards.

54:35.960 --> 54:38.042
He's not here to destroy us.

54:38.280 --> 54:39.645
The towers,

54:39.720 --> 54:42.451
they draw in the lightning,
so he can collect it!

54:42.520 --> 54:45.808
It's what he's been preparing for
the whole time!

55:03.240 --> 55:04.844
I understand.

55:06.000 --> 55:07.525
We're going to the towers.

55:07.600 --> 55:08.965
- No!
-It's too dangerous.

55:09.040 --> 55:10.963
For once, my head and heart,

55:11.120 --> 55:13.487
they're actually telling me
to do the same thing.

55:13.560 --> 55:14.641
Fawn, you can't!

55:14.720 --> 55:16.051
It's okay.

55:17.400 --> 55:22.167
That said, if things don't go well,
Sil, you can have my rock collection.

55:24.920 --> 55:26.251
All right, big guy-

55:26.400 --> 55:28.084
Just follow my glow.

55:37.320 --> 55:38.924
Okay, Gruff! That's it!

55:43.720 --> 55:44.721
Pull up!

55:48.800 --> 55:51.201
I'm up here! Higher!

55:51.520 --> 55:52.885
Gruff, fly higher!

55:55.600 --> 55:56.601
You Okay?

56:30.280 --> 56:31.486
Is that Fawn?

56:41.000 --> 56:42.490
Two down, two to go!

56:54.520 --> 56:55.885
One more, Gruff!

57:02.120 --> 57:03.121
No!

57:06.680 --> 57:07.681
Gruff!

57:22.160 --> 57:23.321
Nyx!

57:23.400 --> 57:24.447
What are you doing?

57:24.680 --> 57:26.523
Saving Pixie Hollow!

57:26.600 --> 57:29.171
No, he was saving Pixie Hollow.

57:59.240 --> 58:01.163
Nyx, we don't have much time.

58:01.240 --> 58:02.765
The fire is spreading fast.

58:06.360 --> 58:07.327
Listen to me.

58:07.400 --> 58:10.483
Get out of here. Get everyone to safety.

58:11.480 --> 58:12.686
Go!

58:21.840 --> 58:25.003
Gruff, it's too late.
How can we catch it all?

58:41.120 --> 58:42.281
Follow me.

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:25.881
Can you see them?

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:26.961
There!

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:30.927
Fawn!

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:32.607
Help them!

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:06.406
- Oh, no!
- Fawn.

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:07.481
Fawn?

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:10.082
- Fawn, wake up!
- Is she okay?

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:15.881
No!

01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:17.446
This can't be.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.365
Gruff?

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:23.840
Hey!

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:28.050
That's my big, furry monster.

01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:37.681
Fawn!

01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:59.921
<i>Every fairy should know the true story
about the NeverBeast.</i>

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:05.643
<i>He is the brave guardian
of Pixie Hollow.</i>

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:10.401
<i>He is our hero.</i>

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:14.729
<i>And his name is Gruff.</i>

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:18.202
Easy, easy. A little more.

01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:20.124
Good job!

01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:33.531
Yay, Gruff!

01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:35.325
Thanks, Gruff!

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:38.528
Well, how about that?

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:40.245
They finally see what I see.

01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:48.409
Took them long enough, huh?

01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:54.369
- Hey, Gruff.
- Hi, Gruffy.

01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:56.844
What do y'all think we should do now?

01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:58.251
Actually, I made a list.

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.050
Of course you did.

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:01.884
We should go truffle snuffling!

01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:04.248
With that sense of smell...

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:06.010
Speaking of smells,

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:07.525
how about a bath?

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:11.446
I've got a lilac shampoo
that could do wonders for that fur.

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:14.001
I know a hot spring that's just his size.

01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:15.929
With a waterfall!

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:20.285
Fawn?

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:25.881
Gruff?

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:29.965
Looks like he needs a nap.

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:31.849
A little rest will perk him right up.

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:33.725
Won't it, Fawn?

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.365
His work is done.

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:39.440
It's time for him
to go back into hibernation.

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:41.685
How long are we talking about?

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:43.489
A month? A season?

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:47.050
A Year?

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:52.851
More like 1,000 years.

01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:55.571
But that means...

01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:57.802
We'll never see him again.

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:08.565
It's time.

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:16.684
<i>Do you long to be left all alone</i>

01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:24.849
<i>Set apart with a heart made of stone</i>

01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:30.049
<i>There's a light that you shine</i>

01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:31.805
<i>There's a love</i>

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:35.729
<i>I see it in your eyes</i>

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:40.091
<i>Every day, every night</i>

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:45.367
<i>I know time may divide</i>

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:50.368
<i>But fate is something we refuse to hide</i>

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:55.050
<i>And it's real and it's right</i>

01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:02.411
<i>Something strange out of sight</i>

01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:08.731
<i>We say good night</i>

01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:13.566
Anyone who sleeps for 1,000 years

01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:15.563
deserves a decent bed.

01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:18.282
And a fluffy pillow.

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:22.442
Make that a "Gruff y" pillow.

01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:26.802
A spring-filled water bowl
that never runs dry.

01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:30.288
A night light,
so you never have to be scared.

01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:37.571
A little fresh air to keep you cool.

01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:52.526
And the enduring respect
of a grateful Scout.

01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:06.090
Hey, big guy.

01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:09.765
I won't see you again.

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:15.689
But I know you'll always be there
when we need you.

01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:21.964
I'm really gonna miss you.

01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:34.563
I love you, Gruff.
