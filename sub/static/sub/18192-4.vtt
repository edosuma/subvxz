00:02.480 --> 00:03.959
(Alarm)

00:09.680 --> 00:11.636
Morning, Dad.

00:13.840 --> 00:16.114
Don't be a bad daddy. Smile!

00:17.480 --> 00:19.436
Come on! (Laughs)

00:57.680 --> 00:59.636
The crowd is hushed.

01:00.520 --> 01:02.476
Thank you!

01:31.520 --> 01:33.351
Sorry l'm late.

01:33.440 --> 01:35.396
Meeting ran on.

01:36.200 --> 01:38.236
So, what's for dinner?

01:38.320 --> 01:40.276
- Chinese.
- Oh, great!

01:41.320 --> 01:43.276
- Where is it?
- At the takeaway.

01:44.280 --> 01:47.238
- Will you go?
- We had takeaway last night.

01:47.320 --> 01:49.117
Yeah, but that was lndian.

01:49.200 --> 01:51.998
What are you planning for the Sunday roast -
a kebab?

01:52.080 --> 01:55.993
David, don't start. This has got to be in
by tomorrow and editing takes time.

01:56.080 --> 01:58.389
Surely you just press spellcheck?

02:00.200 --> 02:04.557
How difficult can children's books be?
They're less than ten words to a page.

02:04.640 --> 02:07.359
Precisely!
So each one has to be chosen carefully.

02:09.160 --> 02:13.153
- ls this the last night you're going to work late?
- lf you let me get on with it.

02:15.080 --> 02:17.514
- And tomorrow we won't have takeaway?
- No.

02:18.920 --> 02:20.990
You can take me out for dinner instead.

02:23.160 --> 02:26.038
- And did he?
- He wanted to but l had to work late.

02:26.120 --> 02:28.076
- l thought you said that...
- l know.

02:28.160 --> 02:31.436
But since l've been back at work
it takes twice as long to do things.

02:31.520 --> 02:34.876
l've lost my confidence, can't make decisions.
lt's a bloody nightmare.

02:34.960 --> 02:37.349
- lt's being married to David.
WOMAN: Tea or coffee?

02:37.440 --> 02:39.510
Oh, um... What are you having?

02:40.680 --> 02:41.715
Karen!

02:41.800 --> 02:43.995
Tea, please. Yeah, l'll have tea.

02:44.080 --> 02:47.550
You were good at your job before you had Josh.
Why not now?

02:47.640 --> 02:50.552
<i>- l wish my boss had your faith.
- l wish you did.</i>

02:50.640 --> 02:52.756
Take for both and we'll eat in.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.991
- Make mine a takeaway.
- We're supposed to be having lunch together.

02:56.080 --> 02:59.789
We've queued together. Sorry, Rachel,
but l've got to get back to the office.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.393
You stay.

03:01.480 --> 03:04.597
And look like l've no mates,
or that l'm some slapper on the pull?

03:04.680 --> 03:06.636
You never know. You might get lucky!

03:07.520 --> 03:09.192
Bye.

03:17.120 --> 03:19.076
Look at them all.

03:19.240 --> 03:21.196
Doesn't it make you want to vomit?

03:22.760 --> 03:24.716
He does.

03:25.120 --> 03:27.475
People like that give evolution a bad name.

03:28.880 --> 03:30.836
They're the ''missing link''.

03:33.920 --> 03:35.876
(Sings) Heaven knows l'm miserable now.

03:35.960 --> 03:39.714
- What's up with you?
- l just thought there'd be more to it than this.

03:41.560 --> 03:44.358
When you were younger, Pete,
didn't you have dreams?

03:44.440 --> 03:46.476
- Yeah.
- Well, like what?

03:46.560 --> 03:49.916
One, l seem to remember,
involved Samantha Fox at a jumble sale.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.833
Not like that. l mean dreams. Ambitions.

03:54.360 --> 03:57.716
Um, no. Not unless you count
Samantha Fox at the jumble sale.

03:59.480 --> 04:01.675
l was going to be a world leader.

04:01.760 --> 04:03.671
Well, that's certainly ambitious.

04:04.400 --> 04:07.278
The closest l ever came
was captain of the Under 1 2s.

04:08.360 --> 04:11.955
We can't all be world leaders.
Some of us have to be sheep.

04:12.040 --> 04:14.190
Sitting at t'baaas! Baaas!

04:15.240 --> 04:17.310
l woke up this morning and realised...

04:19.399 --> 04:21.356
..this is it.

04:22.760 --> 04:24.716
lt was a good side, the Under 1 2s.

04:25.480 --> 04:27.152
Life is elsewhere.

04:27.920 --> 04:30.559
And l don't have...the address.

04:32.800 --> 04:36.759
What you need is a sense of purpose.
l'm just the man to give it to you. So...

04:36.840 --> 04:40.355
- How do you fancy being Adam's godfather?
- Oh, l'd love to.

04:40.440 --> 04:43.193
Take your time to think about it.
lt is a responsibility.

04:43.280 --> 04:45.430
No, it's not. ls it?

04:45.520 --> 04:48.273
- You have to remember his birthday.
- Rachel can do that.

04:48.360 --> 04:50.351
- Set him a good example.
- Rachel can do that.

04:50.440 --> 04:53.876
- Be someone he can turn to.
- When he can't talk to his parents?

04:53.960 --> 04:58.112
Listen, little Adam, you're probably not gay,
but if you are...it's fine.

04:59.840 --> 05:03.355
- Maybe this is a bad idea.
- Go on, go on. l can be trusted.

05:03.440 --> 05:05.078
All right. Um...

05:05.160 --> 05:07.515
Be someone to tell him about life.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.477
Oh, well, sure.

05:09.560 --> 05:10.879
Life's elsewhere.

05:10.960 --> 05:13.394
(Mimics him) And you don't have the address.

05:14.200 --> 05:15.713
You tosser.

05:19.880 --> 05:21.632
l've got the focus group results.

05:21.720 --> 05:23.676
How does Millie score?

05:23.760 --> 05:26.035
Quite well. Stanley The Sports Car does better.

05:26.120 --> 05:28.315
Stanley? But he's the villain of the piece.

05:28.400 --> 05:31.995
Mm-hm. But kids love it
when he belches exhaust fumes in Millie's face.

05:32.080 --> 05:34.036
- (Mutters) God.
- Karen?

05:34.120 --> 05:36.076
- Yeah?
- Could l have a word?

05:37.320 --> 05:41.108
lf she wants Stanley
to have his own series...l'm leaving.

05:44.600 --> 05:46.158
<i>AIexander WeIcht.</i>

05:49.560 --> 05:52.870
- Booker Prize winner?
- Yeah. Blanket Of Tears. Beautiful book.

05:52.960 --> 05:55.155
Never knew sex could be so good.

05:55.240 --> 05:57.708
That scene where she's ironing...

05:57.800 --> 05:59.950
We're going to publish Alec's new novel.

06:00.040 --> 06:01.758
Mmmm!

06:01.840 --> 06:03.796
(Saucy laughter)

06:05.560 --> 06:07.516
l want you to be his editor.

06:08.800 --> 06:11.598
- Me.
- Mm. Alec insists on the best.

06:12.360 --> 06:15.875
- Me?
- You've always had the perfect eye for detail.

06:17.960 --> 06:21.077
l gave you children's books
when you came back just to ease you in.

06:21.160 --> 06:25.039
- lt's time you spread your wings.
- Well, l'm not actually sure l'm up to it, Gina.

06:25.120 --> 06:27.236
Let me be the judge of that, OK?

06:27.320 --> 06:29.276
Well, l have commitments, you see.

06:30.040 --> 06:31.678
Your son?

06:31.760 --> 06:35.833
- l was actually thinking more my husband.
- l'm sure David will understand.

06:37.360 --> 06:39.954
- lt's a wonderful opportunity.
- l know.

06:40.040 --> 06:43.191
- That anybody in their right mind would jump at.
- l know.

06:43.280 --> 06:46.113
So why do l think you're about to turn it down?

06:47.480 --> 06:51.359
Good news, love.
Sheila's agreed to be godmother.

06:51.440 --> 06:54.637
- Do you think that's a good idea?
- Oh... (Splutters)

06:54.720 --> 06:56.915
- What's wrong with her?
- She's a Christian.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.833
And she is my only sister.

07:00.600 --> 07:03.876
And she hasn't got any children of her own,
and...

07:03.960 --> 07:05.916
And, and, and, and...

07:06.000 --> 07:07.911
And, and, and, and what, love?

07:08.000 --> 07:11.037
And your mum rang.
They want to come and visit this weekend.

07:11.120 --> 07:13.315
- l hope you said we were away.
- We're not.

07:13.400 --> 07:14.389
So?

07:15.600 --> 07:18.319
Oh, for God's sake.
They're Adam's grandparents.

07:18.400 --> 07:20.595
lt's nice they want to see him.

07:20.680 --> 07:22.591
lt's lovely.

07:22.680 --> 07:24.272
l think.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.635
- They'll only be staying a week.
- A week!

07:26.720 --> 07:28.676
(Whimpers) To ten days...

07:30.400 --> 07:33.676
- Thank you, David.
- l'm a godfather. To my niece. Rebecca.

07:34.560 --> 07:36.630
Oh, yeah? How old is she?

07:36.720 --> 07:38.676
Oh, let's see.

07:38.760 --> 07:41.718
When she was born
l was working on the Lanskey takeover,

07:41.800 --> 07:43.836
which means she must be er...

07:44.680 --> 07:46.636
- She's six.
- Six?

07:49.120 --> 07:53.318
- ls it that long since Lanskey's went under?
(Doorbell)

07:55.240 --> 07:57.196
David's close to his niece, is he?

07:57.280 --> 07:59.350
l'm surprised he remembered her name.

08:04.560 --> 08:07.757
- Oh, hi. Karen Morrison lives here, yeah?
- Yes.

08:07.840 --> 08:10.115
l'm Alec Welcht.

08:10.200 --> 08:11.679
Her author.

08:11.760 --> 08:13.796
Oh, yes! Millie The Mountain Bike.

08:13.880 --> 08:16.838
- Yes. l didn't realise it had an author.
- Millie...?

08:16.920 --> 08:19.480
Tell me, how do you fill in the rest of your time?

08:19.560 --> 08:22.597
Well, children's books can be literature too,
you know.

08:22.680 --> 08:24.033
Mm!

08:24.920 --> 08:26.797
- Yeah, come in.
- Thanks.

08:26.880 --> 08:29.155
Karen? lt's your ''author'' to see you.

08:29.880 --> 08:32.792
- Sorry, l didn't catch the name.
- Alexander Welcht.

08:35.799 --> 08:37.916
- Karen.
- Mr Welcht.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.150
- Nice to meet you.
- Like the real writer. Do you ever get confused?

08:41.240 --> 08:43.595
- Well, l am now. Hello, good evening.
- Hi.

08:43.679 --> 08:45.318
- Hello.
- Very nice to meet you.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.550
<i>Er, David, this is Alexander Welcht.</i>

08:51.520 --> 08:53.875
Oh, l'm so sorry, Mr Welcht. l'm so sorry.

08:53.960 --> 08:57.191
- Please. Call me Alec.
- Alec. l am so sorry. l had no idea.

08:57.280 --> 08:59.077
l didn't mean to belittle...

08:59.160 --> 09:02.311
Children's books, they're really...
lf l'd known it was you...

09:02.400 --> 09:04.914
- lt's OK.
- Tell me what you think of this wine.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.956
- Please, sit down.
- Oh, thanks.

09:07.040 --> 09:09.315
- Something to eat?
- Humble fare, but...

09:09.400 --> 09:11.834
lt smells delicious, but l don't have time.

09:13.240 --> 09:15.117
- So, Alec, you're a writer.
- Yeah.

09:15.200 --> 09:20.513
- Anything we would have heard of?
- Adam! Mr Welcht wrote Blanket Of Tears.

09:20.600 --> 09:22.033
ADAM: Oh, right!

09:22.120 --> 09:23.951
- You read it?
- No, l saw the movie.

09:24.040 --> 09:25.473
Ah.

09:25.560 --> 09:28.120
Yeah. Hope the book was better!

09:28.200 --> 09:30.156
Well, the Booker judges thought so.

09:33.040 --> 09:35.508
- l started writing a novel once.
- Oh, God...

09:35.600 --> 09:37.556
- Did you finish it?
- No, it was shite.

09:37.640 --> 09:41.872
Should have stuck with it. First draft's
always shite. That's why you need a good editor.

09:41.960 --> 09:47.159
That's why l'm here. l just found out today
the editor l'd requested has turned me down.

09:47.240 --> 09:49.117
(Sighs and tuts) He must be mad.

09:49.200 --> 09:51.270
Either that or she's very discerning.

09:51.360 --> 09:53.191
l wanted to find out which.

09:56.640 --> 09:58.278
Karen!

09:59.000 --> 10:02.231
Er...Mr Welcht, it would really be an honour
to work with you,

10:02.320 --> 10:04.390
but l don't have the time to do it justice.

10:04.480 --> 10:06.869
- Of course you do.
- How would you know?

10:08.560 --> 10:11.358
We have a nanny. We eat takeaway food.

10:11.440 --> 10:13.635
- Not all the time?
- You hate takeaway food.

10:13.720 --> 10:15.915
- l could grow to like it.
- Or cook.

10:19.440 --> 10:23.433
Alec, Karen would be delighted
to be your editor.

10:24.360 --> 10:25.634
Would you?

10:27.040 --> 10:29.110
Yes, l would...Alec.

10:29.880 --> 10:34.317
Well, that...that's just brilliant.
l thought l was going to have to beg.

10:35.600 --> 10:39.275
l hate to drink and run,
but l've got some people to meet for dinner.

10:41.200 --> 10:43.350
Hope you can edit as well as you can cook.

10:44.080 --> 10:45.752
See you tomorrow, Karen.

10:46.680 --> 10:49.752
Good night, everyone. Sorry to barge in.
l'll see myself out.

10:49.840 --> 10:51.558
No, no, let me.

10:52.280 --> 10:55.716
- No-one ever compliments my cooking.
- God, l loved Blanket Of Tears.

10:55.800 --> 10:57.756
God, it was so sexy.

10:58.520 --> 11:00.875
- Do you remember the bit where she...?
- lroning.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.837
l read it with one hand.

11:02.920 --> 11:05.150
(Raunchy laughter)

11:09.400 --> 11:11.356
- Adam?
(Clattering)

11:14.240 --> 11:17.869
- Adam, what are you doing?
- l knew it was up there somewhere.

11:17.960 --> 11:20.599
l couldn't sleep, not after meeting Alec Welcht.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.830
l know he has that effect on women, but...

11:22.920 --> 11:26.595
He's fired me, Rach. He's given me
the sense of purpose l was lacking.

11:26.680 --> 11:30.116
- My novel. l'm going to finish it.
- At three o'clock in the morning?

11:30.200 --> 11:33.670
- Hemingway didn't work office hours.
- No, and he died alone.

11:35.440 --> 11:38.830
- Don't you want to read it?
- l'll wait till it's in paperback.

11:41.240 --> 11:41.990
Ha!

11:42.920 --> 11:44.876
l knew that was a good title.

11:50.360 --> 11:52.316
(Moans softly)

11:53.360 --> 11:55.237
(Gasps)

12:02.240 --> 12:04.310
Oh, David...

12:05.200 --> 12:07.156
Oh, David...

12:08.600 --> 12:11.558
- Karen, l'm trying to read here.
- Oh, so read later.

12:13.240 --> 12:15.196
l will. lt's a long article.

12:24.840 --> 12:26.796
(Door bangs shut)

12:27.720 --> 12:29.551
(Baby cries)

12:29.640 --> 12:31.756
Oh, for heaven's sake. Karen!

12:33.640 --> 12:35.551
(Reads) Night.

12:35.640 --> 12:37.596
Winter.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.796
Dark.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.678
Cold.

12:41.760 --> 12:44.513
- (Stifled giggle)
- The howl of a dog...

12:45.560 --> 12:47.551
..an anthem of despair.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.356
A distant sound.

12:52.120 --> 12:54.076
Growing louder.

12:54.880 --> 12:57.440
- Choo...
- (Laughs openly)

12:57.520 --> 12:59.476
..choo...

13:01.280 --> 13:03.236
- ..choo.
- (Laughs)

13:04.560 --> 13:07.916
- lt might sound better in the morning.
- l doubt it!

13:08.000 --> 13:09.956
Pumping pistons.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.876
- Rattling rails.
- (Laughs)

13:13.800 --> 13:15.313
lron horse?

13:16.120 --> 13:18.076
(Sobs with laughter)

13:19.840 --> 13:22.070
- Go on.
- l thought you were trying to sleep.

13:22.160 --> 13:24.116
What, and miss this?

13:32.080 --> 13:35.231
- l think l'll start from scratch.
- Oh, Adam!

13:38.560 --> 13:40.516
(Sounds horn)

13:49.600 --> 13:51.192
Hooray!

13:52.320 --> 13:53.753
They're here.

13:53.840 --> 13:58.356
JENNY: lf it starts getting to you,
take a deep breath, count to a hundred.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.997
(Takes a deep breath)

14:01.080 --> 14:06.234
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...

14:06.320 --> 14:08.276
(Baby grizzles)

14:08.360 --> 14:10.476
l brought some provisions.

14:11.360 --> 14:13.271
We do have shops in Manchester.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.718
We like certain brands.

14:15.800 --> 14:19.110
- Aah!
- There. Hello!

14:19.200 --> 14:22.510
- How was your journey?
- A lot of traffic on the A34.

14:22.600 --> 14:26.070
A34? What's wrong with the M6?
lt's much quicker.

14:26.160 --> 14:28.628
- Since when?
- Since they built it. Look at this.

14:28.720 --> 14:32.190
- What about the roadworks at Knutsford?
- Come off at Sandbach.

14:32.280 --> 14:36.034
- And get caught up in Holmes Chapel?
- Well, it's better than Wilmslow.

14:36.120 --> 14:39.430
- lt wasn't bad. Took us two hours.
- l could knock a half hour off that.

14:39.520 --> 14:41.238
- Oh, yes?
- Yes.

14:41.880 --> 14:43.916
Milk.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.434
One, two, three...

14:46.520 --> 14:50.035
Karen! Karen,
have you seen the papers l left on the table?

14:50.160 --> 14:52.435
- No.
- You were in the bathroom a long time.

14:52.520 --> 14:54.829
l was finishing Alex's book.

14:54.920 --> 14:56.478
Oh, yeah? Any good?

14:56.560 --> 14:58.755
Well, the climax doesn't disappoint.

14:58.840 --> 15:00.637
Ramona!

15:00.720 --> 15:02.676
Charles. Hi, it's David.

15:02.760 --> 15:05.069
Sorry l missed you on Spotlight Northwest.

15:05.160 --> 15:07.435
Yeah, we had a few friends round to dinner.

15:07.520 --> 15:09.590
You've heard of Alexander Welcht?

15:09.680 --> 15:11.557
The author, yeah.

15:11.640 --> 15:14.598
No, seriously. He's a terribly nice guy. Yeah.

15:14.680 --> 15:16.636
OK, see you at 1 1 :00. Jolly good. Bye.

15:16.720 --> 15:17.755
Ramona!

15:17.840 --> 15:20.718
- What did you think of the meal last night?
- What?

15:21.440 --> 15:24.830
- Can you remember what it was?
- l haven't got time for quizzes.

15:24.920 --> 15:26.478
- Ramona!
- Coming!

15:26.560 --> 15:28.676
Ramona, have you seen... What is she doing?

15:28.760 --> 15:31.274
- l thought they were rubbish.
- They are now.

15:31.360 --> 15:33.032
Hey, well done, Ramona.

15:33.120 --> 15:34.792
She used the past tense.

15:34.880 --> 15:38.156
- Haven't you a job to go to?
- Alex is coming here this morning.

15:38.240 --> 15:41.516
- l hope you're going to get dressed.
- Of course l am.

15:41.600 --> 15:45.479
- He's taking me to lunch.
- Oh, the punishing world of publishing.

15:47.560 --> 15:49.516
Say hi to Alec for me.

15:51.520 --> 15:54.193
Karen,
you didn't complain that l haven't kissed you.

15:54.280 --> 15:56.236
l didn't have to, David.

15:57.320 --> 15:59.276
You remembered.

16:06.160 --> 16:08.310
Oh. The christening's a week on Sunday.

16:08.400 --> 16:11.358
- What do l have to do?
- Well, just turn up. Look pious.

16:12.080 --> 16:15.356
You can practise.
And we'd like you to read something for Adam.

16:15.440 --> 16:18.113
- What?
- Anything you like.

16:18.200 --> 16:20.156
Jen's sister's reading the Bible.

16:20.960 --> 16:22.791
- All of it?
- Course not.

16:23.960 --> 16:26.235
Oh, God, l hope not. Better check.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.117
l might write something.

16:30.200 --> 16:34.591
- Oh. How is ''the novel'' coming along?
- lt's a painful process.

16:34.680 --> 16:37.114
- Writer's cramp?
- Writer's block.

16:37.200 --> 16:39.634
- This is my ideas book.
- l see.

16:39.720 --> 16:43.679
l thought l'd write from experience
and then l realised...l haven't had any.

16:43.760 --> 16:46.115
Mm. You should talk to my dad.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.753
War hero. Bootlegger. Romeo.

16:49.840 --> 16:53.071
- l thought he was a florist.
- Oh, he is. And a bullshitter.

16:53.960 --> 16:58.476
(Over vacuum cleaner) So there l am
giving Frank Sinatra a leg-up over this wall...

16:58.560 --> 17:00.835
- Chorlton-cum-Hardy.
- He was doing a concert.

17:00.920 --> 17:04.151
Yeah. ln Chorlton-cum-Hardy.

17:05.280 --> 17:08.670
- ln Manchester, at the Palace!
- He was very good.

17:09.640 --> 17:12.915
- So you saw him, then?
- No, we couldn't get tickets.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.797
But the papers liked him.

17:14.880 --> 17:16.632
Audrey!

17:16.720 --> 17:18.675
You don't need to do that.

17:18.760 --> 17:20.557
Just trying to be helpful.

17:21.280 --> 17:22.838
Feet!

17:27.280 --> 17:31.353
So, Dad, there you are
giving Frank Sinatra a leg-up over this wall.

17:31.440 --> 17:35.433
You would've thought
he'd have slipped you a couple of spare tickets.

17:35.520 --> 17:38.273
Look, do you want to hear this story?

17:38.360 --> 17:42.035
- He might have been telling the truth.
- Bollocks! He's allergic to it.

17:43.200 --> 17:46.476
- You're quite hard on your old man.
- No more than he deserves.

17:46.560 --> 17:47.993
(Gurgles)

17:48.080 --> 17:50.036
- He's beautiful, isn't he?
- Yeah.

17:51.400 --> 17:53.356
- (Gurgles)
- Ssh, ssh, ssh.

17:54.080 --> 17:56.036
There. (Clucks softly)

17:57.400 --> 17:59.231
Jenny's looks.

18:00.320 --> 18:02.629
You know,
you were my age when you had me.

18:02.720 --> 18:04.676
- Really?
- Yeah. l worked it out.

18:06.720 --> 18:08.676
Maths was never your strong point.

18:10.920 --> 18:13.115
l'm going to be a good dad to him.

18:14.640 --> 18:16.596
l wanted to be to you.

18:20.280 --> 18:22.350
Yeah, well, we can't have everything.

18:23.080 --> 18:25.116
- Not with a son like you, no.
- Ssh...

18:27.280 --> 18:30.431
<i>PETE: He can give it out,
but when the joke's on him...</i>

18:30.520 --> 18:34.593
l thought now that l've had a kid,
he'd treat me more like a grown-up.

18:34.680 --> 18:35.829
Doesn't he?

18:35.920 --> 18:37.797
Wash your hands?

18:38.560 --> 18:40.835
Not really, no.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.194
He-llo!

18:42.280 --> 18:44.236
- Same again?
- Thank you.

18:56.280 --> 18:58.236
The top of page 45.

18:59.080 --> 19:00.991
Yeah. What's the problem?

19:01.080 --> 19:04.993
lt's not a problem. l just thought perhaps
that she might be a bit more direct.

19:06.240 --> 19:08.196
Direct. How, exactly?

19:08.920 --> 19:11.354
<i>I dunno.
I suppose I think she'd say something.</i>

19:11.440 --> 19:14.955
She's slept with him in her mind.
She'd tell him how she feels.

19:15.040 --> 19:17.679
Yeah, l probably haven't been explicit enough.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.276
To be honest,
l find it really difficult writing for women.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.036
lt certainly doesn't read like that.

19:25.120 --> 19:28.556
Well, what would you say?
lf you were Madeleine.

19:28.640 --> 19:31.108
Oh, God. l don't know.

19:31.200 --> 19:33.395
Just put yourself in her place, you know.

19:34.120 --> 19:35.599
lmagine l'm Patrick.

19:35.680 --> 19:37.432
No! (Giggles)

19:38.160 --> 19:40.355
No, Karen, this'll really help me, OK?

19:40.440 --> 19:44.274
Just do a stream of consciousness thing.
Something off the top of your head.

19:44.360 --> 19:46.157
(Sighs)

19:46.880 --> 19:48.552
OK. OK, OK.

19:49.280 --> 19:51.236
(Pants and giggles)

19:53.200 --> 19:55.156
OK, OK. Right...

19:56.640 --> 19:58.596
Right, er...

19:58.680 --> 20:00.636
Hearing your voice isn't enough.

20:02.080 --> 20:04.878
l need to feel your body next to mine.

20:04.960 --> 20:06.439
<i>That's good, yeah.</i>

20:06.520 --> 20:08.431
My skin against yours.

20:10.080 --> 20:12.310
My sweat's mingling with yours.

20:13.760 --> 20:16.558
We're becoming one
as we give way to our passion.

20:19.240 --> 20:22.038
<i>I feeI...er...</i>

20:24.160 --> 20:26.116
l love you.

20:26.920 --> 20:30.071
<i>- I want you.
- See you in ten minutes.</i>

20:30.160 --> 20:32.071
(Laughs raucously)

20:33.680 --> 20:36.752
<i>- Alec!
- That's the best phone sex I've had aII morning.</i>

20:36.840 --> 20:39.354
Ah, well, that's why l'm an editor.

20:39.440 --> 20:41.510
Well, what can l say? You give great edit.

20:41.600 --> 20:44.068
Thank you, darling. (Giggles)

20:44.160 --> 20:46.116
Look, see you at one o'clock, OK?

20:47.200 --> 20:49.156
Bye, now.

20:50.880 --> 20:54.031
And l'll need those figures by tomorrow.
Gross, not net.

20:55.480 --> 20:58.950
- David, call for you. Line one.
- l said no interruptions, Sam.

20:59.040 --> 21:02.191
l know, l'm sorry,
but the lady insisted it's important.

21:02.280 --> 21:04.236
At least, l think she did.

21:06.720 --> 21:07.914
Yep?

21:08.000 --> 21:09.956
<i>David, it's Ramona.</i>

21:10.880 --> 21:12.836
Ramona? ls Josh all right?

21:12.920 --> 21:16.879
Yeah, Josh is fine. lt's me. l no fine.
Please - you got to come home now.

21:16.960 --> 21:18.996
What are you talking about?

21:19.080 --> 21:22.868
l have see things and l have hear things
and they are no good things.

21:22.960 --> 21:26.111
<i>- ls Karen there?
- Yes, she here but she going out.</i>

21:26.200 --> 21:29.988
She meet Mr Welcht. Oy.
They have speak each other, David.

21:30.840 --> 21:32.751
''l...l think l love you.''

21:35.520 --> 21:39.069
- l beg your pardon?
- Yes! ''l love you. l want you!''

21:44.880 --> 21:46.711
Ramona, l'm shocked!

21:46.800 --> 21:49.439
l know is shocking. But is the truth.

21:49.520 --> 21:52.193
l don't know what to say. l... l mean...

21:53.840 --> 21:55.796
<i>- l'm flattered, but...
- FIatter?</i>

21:56.760 --> 21:59.354
- But l'm married.
- Flatter? What is?

21:59.440 --> 22:01.271
(Door closes)
- David, she going now.

22:01.360 --> 22:03.157
Please, you gotta come home!

22:03.240 --> 22:05.515
<i>Ramona, I don't think that's a good idea, OK?</i>

22:05.600 --> 22:07.989
Let's just say no more about it, OK?

22:09.240 --> 22:11.390
Let's pretend it never happened.

22:11.480 --> 22:12.913
iMamÃ¡! iSÃ­!

22:16.680 --> 22:19.717
That was my nanny.
She's er...a little highly strung.

22:23.160 --> 22:24.991
Spanish.

22:25.760 --> 22:27.671
Flatter.

22:27.760 --> 22:29.751
Flatter.

22:30.680 --> 22:32.750
Flatter. ''More flat.''

22:35.520 --> 22:37.476
Hmm.

22:37.560 --> 22:41.872
Oh, thank you, God,
for l am out of the house, the devil house.

22:41.960 --> 22:44.474
Are Pete and his dad
still winding each other up?

22:44.560 --> 22:48.553
Yeah. l can live with that.
lt's Pete's mum. She's driving me mad.

22:49.440 --> 22:52.079
Tesco's have had to send out
for more Mr Muscle.

22:52.160 --> 22:55.596
You drop a crumb
and she's caught it before it hits the carpet.

22:56.440 --> 22:57.668
Nightmare.

22:57.760 --> 23:00.194
- Sorry l'm late, girls.
- Oh, s-whit s-whoo.

23:00.280 --> 23:02.840
- Late lunch?
- Long lunch.

23:02.920 --> 23:05.912
- We had to finish the MoÃ«t.
- Champag-ny!

23:06.840 --> 23:09.308
Was this you and David?

23:09.400 --> 23:11.834
- Alexander Welcht.
- Writer?

23:12.960 --> 23:14.279
Wri...

23:14.360 --> 23:16.237
Blanket Of Tears!

23:16.320 --> 23:18.595
- Ooh, that bit where she's...
BOTH: lroning.

23:18.680 --> 23:20.477
Yeah! lt's fab.

23:20.560 --> 23:24.030
Clearly you have to tell us about it. Come on.
Every detail. (Raps table)

23:24.120 --> 23:26.076
OK, OK. OK.

23:26.160 --> 23:28.958
Well, it was a very noisy restaurant, right,

23:29.040 --> 23:31.190
<i>so we had to sit quite cIose together...</i>

23:32.240 --> 23:35.676
Don't look now, but there's
a woman behind you in a red jacket.

23:36.760 --> 23:38.591
l said, don't look now!

23:39.480 --> 23:41.391
Daniella Dunn.

23:41.480 --> 23:43.311
Well...

23:44.040 --> 23:46.031
She was born...

23:46.120 --> 23:47.917
Daniel Dunn.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.558
- No!
- Yeah.

23:49.640 --> 23:51.073
- No.
- Yes.

23:51.160 --> 23:55.199
- l said, don't look now! God!
- (Giggles)

23:55.280 --> 23:57.236
He put his hand on your arm?

23:57.360 --> 23:59.032
Twice.

23:59.120 --> 24:01.588
- (Chants) Fancies you, fancies you!
- What?

24:01.680 --> 24:03.272
There's more, there's more.

24:05.840 --> 24:07.319
Karen, um...

24:08.720 --> 24:10.631
Would you mind if l...

24:12.960 --> 24:14.996
..if l dedicated this book to you?

24:16.560 --> 24:17.675
Me?

24:17.760 --> 24:18.909
You?

24:19.000 --> 24:20.558
Me.

24:21.520 --> 24:25.274
Well, without you,
it wouldn't be half the work it's gonna be.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.349
Me?

24:31.600 --> 24:33.670
ls there another Karen at the table...

24:35.200 --> 24:36.394
..Karen?

24:36.480 --> 24:39.438
Seems to me the gentleman
wants to get into your panties.

24:39.520 --> 24:41.112
The thought had crossed my mind.

24:41.200 --> 24:44.351
- He touches your arm so he wants to shag you?
- Touched it twice.

24:44.440 --> 24:46.795
Why? Why is that so ridiculous?

24:46.880 --> 24:52.079
Karen...if he wanted to have an affair,
don't you think he'd be a bit more explicit?

24:53.080 --> 24:56.755
- Maybe he likes subtlety.
- Oh. The bit where she's ironing?

24:58.600 --> 25:01.637
- Anyway, even if l did, would it be so wrong?
- Yes!

25:04.440 --> 25:06.351
Er...well, er...

25:06.440 --> 25:08.795
He's a Booker prizewinner. Well...

25:09.880 --> 25:14.829
My God. So adultery's fine,
as long as it's with a celebrity?

25:14.920 --> 25:18.515
- Who died and made you Pope?
- Karen, what about your family?

25:19.520 --> 25:21.272
(Jen gurgles)

25:21.360 --> 25:22.475
(Giggles)

25:22.560 --> 25:24.357
(Gurgles)

25:25.080 --> 25:27.548
- (Gargles)
- Could l have a cappuccino, please?

25:27.640 --> 25:30.791
(Football on TV)
There's cheese and some leftover salad.

25:30.880 --> 25:33.075
- ls it curling?
- No, it's football!

25:33.160 --> 25:35.116
Ha-ha! The salad.

25:35.200 --> 25:38.556
- Only at the edges.
- Oh, l'm really looking forward to this!

25:38.640 --> 25:40.756
So who's playing?

25:40.840 --> 25:44.310
Manchester United and Barnsley.

25:44.400 --> 25:46.356
- FA Cup.
- Oh. Right.

25:46.440 --> 25:49.113
- Not a fan of football, then?
- No. Can't stand it.

25:49.200 --> 25:51.555
But it's better than an evening on my own.

25:51.640 --> 25:53.596
l'll make a dressing, shall l?

25:54.640 --> 25:56.278
Are we going to tell him?

25:56.360 --> 25:58.590
- How long till kickoff?
- A couple of minutes.

25:58.680 --> 26:00.910
- No.
- Do you have any balsamic vinegar?

26:01.000 --> 26:02.956
- (Cackles)
- Er...possibly.

26:04.760 --> 26:07.593
So, um...how are things with you and your dad?

26:08.880 --> 26:11.633
- lt's not like you to be interested.
- That's not true.

26:11.720 --> 26:13.676
OK, it's not like you to show concern.

26:13.760 --> 26:18.709
l just thought you might want to tell us about...
l don't know...his latest outrage.

26:18.800 --> 26:21.951
- l don't see why they have to stay the night.
- Who?

26:22.040 --> 26:23.996
Karen and Alec Welcht.

26:24.080 --> 26:27.516
They've only gone to Liverpool.
He's reading an extract from his new book.

26:27.600 --> 26:30.797
- Look, David...
- lt's probably a long extract.

26:30.880 --> 26:33.997
- There's something you should know.
- (Splutters) Kickoff!

26:34.080 --> 26:36.036
You go on.

26:38.600 --> 26:41.034
Um...l think Karen's having an affair.

26:41.120 --> 26:42.678
(Chuckles)

26:42.760 --> 26:44.273
With Alec Welcht.

26:45.600 --> 26:47.318
Hm?

26:47.400 --> 26:49.356
Alec Welcht.

26:51.440 --> 26:53.476
Don't be ridiculous.

26:54.480 --> 26:57.517
Yeah, you're probably right.
Forget l said anything.

26:59.520 --> 27:01.590
No, l know she is.

27:01.680 --> 27:04.592
- Yeah, l knew all along.
- lt's probably rubbish.

27:05.600 --> 27:07.636
No, l...l was aware about it.

27:09.040 --> 27:12.669
You know, the...the dresses.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.956
Hairdos.

27:27.920 --> 27:30.992
- The silk negligee she packed this morning.
- Silk?

27:36.280 --> 27:39.670
- lt's not your fault.
- l encouraged them to spend time together.

27:40.760 --> 27:41.715
Oh.

27:43.800 --> 27:45.756
Karen. l was just on my way to you.

27:47.880 --> 27:50.952
- Champagne?
- Er, yeah, sure.

27:51.040 --> 27:53.190
Why not? Come in.

27:54.800 --> 27:56.756
l just thought we should celebrate.

27:56.840 --> 27:59.400
- The reading went so well.
- Yeah, it did, didn't it?

27:59.480 --> 28:02.711
l was worried about the audience to begin with.
Took some warming up.

28:02.800 --> 28:05.712
Rubbish.
You had them eating out of your hand.

28:05.800 --> 28:09.395
Well, the trick is just to focus
on one particular person.

28:09.480 --> 28:11.436
Give them all you've got.

28:12.280 --> 28:14.874
And did you find someone to focus on?

28:14.960 --> 28:16.712
Oh, l did.

28:16.800 --> 28:18.756
l certainly did.

28:20.400 --> 28:22.436
(Champagne cork pops)

28:34.040 --> 28:37.589
Well...here's to a successful evening.

28:38.520 --> 28:40.476
That's only just begun.

28:47.400 --> 28:49.118
Oh, my God.

28:49.200 --> 28:51.156
Oh, sorry, this is, um...

28:51.240 --> 28:53.754
- lt's Trudi, isn't it?
- That's right.

28:53.840 --> 28:56.513
- This is Karen, my editor.
- Nice to meet you.

28:56.600 --> 28:58.397
Hi.

28:58.480 --> 29:01.438
- Trudi was in the front row. Here, darling.
- Cheers.

29:01.520 --> 29:03.988
- You must have noticed her.
- Um, well...

29:04.080 --> 29:06.469
l don't think l'm as observant as you think.

29:08.720 --> 29:10.915
Um, l thought you were on the way to my room.

29:11.960 --> 29:14.474
Oh, yeah.
You don't have any condoms, do you?

29:16.880 --> 29:18.711
No.

29:18.800 --> 29:20.597
No, l'm sorry, l don't.

29:20.680 --> 29:22.159
Oh. Never mind.

29:22.240 --> 29:24.276
Mm... Do you want some?

29:25.200 --> 29:27.395
- No, thank you. l don't.
- Oh, OK.

29:28.160 --> 29:29.718
Er, l'd better be going.

29:29.800 --> 29:33.759
- l haven't embarrassed you, have l?
- God, no! (Laughs) God, not at all.

29:34.800 --> 29:36.756
Um... (Laughs) Er...

29:38.080 --> 29:41.436
l just don't...
l don't really like champagne that much.

29:45.280 --> 29:46.952
See you.

29:51.160 --> 29:55.199
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

29:55.680 --> 29:59.958
Shit, you shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit, shit...

30:00.040 --> 30:02.395
Shit, shit, shit, shit...
(Mobile rings)

30:04.280 --> 30:06.236
(Ringing continues)

30:10.040 --> 30:11.996
What do you want?

30:33.800 --> 30:36.678
Bastard!
l'll bet he had his eye on her from the start.

30:37.920 --> 30:39.876
That's how she got the job.

30:41.080 --> 30:44.550
- Oh, God, l don't believe this.
- Oh, God, l don't believe this.

30:44.640 --> 30:47.791
- Have Barnsley scored?
- No, this! Your novel.

30:47.880 --> 30:51.316
- l'm a cuckold of my own making.
- lt's me and my dad, isn't it?

30:51.400 --> 30:52.879
Well...loosely.

30:53.040 --> 30:55.156
Loosely! You haven't even changed the names!

30:55.240 --> 30:57.310
l was going to. ls there one you'd like?

30:57.400 --> 30:59.789
How dare you say these things about us!

30:59.880 --> 31:02.189
l love my dad. lt's just...it's just...

31:02.280 --> 31:05.192
- Oh, l can't stand him!
- Don't take it personally.

31:05.280 --> 31:09.159
- l do take it personally. He's shagging my wife.
- Unconfirmed. Give me that.

31:09.240 --> 31:12.232
No! There's absolutely no way you're having it.
lt's mine!

31:12.320 --> 31:15.198
- lt's my life!
- l mean, how could she?

31:15.280 --> 31:17.635
He's so pretentious!

31:17.720 --> 31:20.598
You've taken the piss out of me
ever since we were at school!

31:20.680 --> 31:22.796
Yeah, well, everyone did. You were fat.

31:22.880 --> 31:25.440
Yes, and l still am, according to you!

31:25.520 --> 31:27.476
But you called me lan Paisley!

31:27.560 --> 31:30.074
- Because you talk funny!
- Two can play at that game.

31:30.160 --> 31:34.039
- You arrogant shit!
- l'm not without admirers of my own.

31:34.120 --> 31:35.951
You're jealous. You always have been.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.956
Don't bother getting up.

31:39.680 --> 31:43.070
l'm going home now...to sleep with Ramona.

31:51.280 --> 31:53.236
(Flamenco guitar music)

31:55.760 --> 31:57.239
OlÃ©!

32:02.040 --> 32:03.917
Don't be afraid.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.956
lt's just me.

32:07.840 --> 32:09.796
Da-veed!

32:12.720 --> 32:16.156
These past few days
l haven't been able to take my eyes off you.

32:16.880 --> 32:19.075
- You feel so young.
- Mmm.

32:19.160 --> 32:21.116
So firm.

32:22.160 --> 32:26.199
Mm! Me encanta el olor de tus cabellos.

32:27.200 --> 32:29.316
Oh, David...

32:29.400 --> 32:31.356
Karen!

32:34.120 --> 32:36.475
Oh, l love it when you speak Spanish.

32:36.560 --> 32:38.516
l can explain.

32:39.640 --> 32:42.029
- Explain what?
- Why l'm here.

32:42.120 --> 32:44.475
- lt's perfectly obvious.
- lt is?

32:45.360 --> 32:48.716
You haven't been this sexy for ages.
Have you been drinking?

32:48.800 --> 32:51.234
Yes. Yes, that's it, yes. l'm drunk.

32:51.320 --> 32:53.515
- (Giggles)
- Completely rat-arsed!

32:54.760 --> 32:56.830
l don't know where l am. l'm...

32:57.600 --> 32:59.591
l thought you were in Liverpool.

32:59.680 --> 33:02.240
- With Alec.
- l decided not to stay.

33:03.280 --> 33:05.555
Anyway, Ramona rang to say Josh had a cold.

33:05.640 --> 33:08.916
l wanted to be close to him,
so l've put her in the spare room.

33:09.000 --> 33:12.310
- l explained all this in my note.
- Your note?

33:12.400 --> 33:15.312
My note telling you to find me here,
you drunkard!

33:15.400 --> 33:17.356
Oh, that note.

33:18.800 --> 33:21.917
Now...what was that you were saying?

33:22.000 --> 33:23.433
Hm?

33:23.520 --> 33:26.637
- ln Spanish.
- Er...

33:27.520 --> 33:29.476
You had a fight?

33:30.360 --> 33:32.316
- Who won?
- Does it matter?

33:33.080 --> 33:35.150
He did. (Laughs)

33:35.880 --> 33:38.394
- So what are you working on now?
- My novel.

33:38.480 --> 33:42.951
Look, once it's a bestseller he'll be happy as
Larry. (Mimics) That's about me, that is.

33:43.040 --> 33:46.635
You realise we're going to their house tomorrow
for dinner with his parents?

33:46.720 --> 33:48.312
Mm-hm.

33:49.120 --> 33:51.873
- Are we still invited?
- He didn't say we weren't.

33:51.960 --> 33:53.916
That is going to be excellent!

33:56.360 --> 33:59.079
- Do you think we shouldn't go?
- l still need an ending.

34:02.160 --> 34:05.038
- Say you'll come. Please!
- No. He hurt my feelings.

34:05.120 --> 34:07.156
You hurt his.

34:07.240 --> 34:10.471
ls that it?
What are you going to do, chuck it over?

34:10.560 --> 34:14.030
Yeah, right.
No, l usually spend lunch hour making revisions.

34:14.120 --> 34:17.271
- After last night, there are quite a few.
- Let's have a look.

34:17.360 --> 34:19.032
- No.
- Go on. Please.

34:19.120 --> 34:22.157
No, it's a work in progress!
Go away, you mad thing. No!

34:42.639 --> 34:44.790
Like Father, Like Son.

34:44.880 --> 34:46.835
Good title. l like it.

34:46.920 --> 34:49.672
- Do you?
- Yeah. Right, let's have a look.

34:49.760 --> 34:55.232
''Pete was never a slave to fashion,
and his style was as flexible as his girth''!

34:55.960 --> 34:57.916
Adam, that's so cruel!

34:58.040 --> 34:59.996
The truth is painful.

35:00.080 --> 35:04.039
''Pete's wife Penny...'' Penny?
l thought you hadn't changed the names.

35:04.120 --> 35:05.792
l haven't. lt's a misprint.

35:05.880 --> 35:09.316
''Pete's wife Penny - The Misprint -
knew her mind.''

35:09.400 --> 35:14.315
That's true. ''She always liked the last word
and, for that matter, every word in between''!

35:14.400 --> 35:17.153
- No!
- lt's dramatic licence!

35:17.240 --> 35:19.196
l mean, obviously it's not true.

35:19.920 --> 35:23.993
You've hurt my feelings. l'll have to go now.
Listen, you will come tonight?

35:24.080 --> 35:27.595
- l'm going to finish the book.
- Fine, just don't finish it tonight.

35:27.680 --> 35:29.830
Have dinner tonight. Please.

35:29.920 --> 35:32.275
Are you really that concerned
about me and Pete?

35:32.360 --> 35:36.114
Mm...no. No, you'll be all right.
You'll patch it up. You always do.

35:36.200 --> 35:41.274
No, it's bloody Wallace and Gromit - Pete's
parents. l could just do with the moral support.

35:44.560 --> 35:46.312
OK, we'll come.

35:46.400 --> 35:48.152
Hoorah.

35:49.960 --> 35:51.916
Only because it's you.

35:58.680 --> 36:00.671
You and Pete have had a falling out, eh?

36:03.320 --> 36:05.276
l'm not supposed to mention it.

36:07.600 --> 36:10.751
- Thanks, Pete.
- Reminds me of when you were kids.

36:10.840 --> 36:12.796
They were always bickering.

36:13.520 --> 36:15.476
Then Pete would sit on him.

36:16.640 --> 36:18.790
Some things haven't changed, then.

36:18.880 --> 36:20.836
Got your notebook, have you?

36:32.520 --> 36:36.752
- Audrey, why don't you go and sit down?
- l'll just finish these plates.

36:36.840 --> 36:39.479
But we haven't even used them yet.

36:40.360 --> 36:42.316
They gather dust in the cupboard.

36:43.160 --> 36:45.879
Oh. Do you like your carrots that thin?

36:45.960 --> 36:47.951
Audrey, sit down!

36:48.040 --> 36:51.476
- You could cut the atmosphere in there with a...
- (Whimpers)

36:55.720 --> 36:57.711
Do you need a hand?

36:57.800 --> 36:59.233
(Gasps)

36:59.320 --> 37:01.151
DAD: l hear you're Adam's godfather.

37:01.240 --> 37:04.869
- Unless l've been sacked.
- Come on, Adam. Pete wouldn't do that.

37:06.200 --> 37:08.156
- Jenny won't let me.
- Hm.

37:08.240 --> 37:10.879
And what do you think
of the young fella's name?

37:10.960 --> 37:12.518
Adam?

37:12.600 --> 37:14.033
l like it.

37:14.120 --> 37:16.076
Adam Preston Gifford.

37:17.280 --> 37:19.475
- No room for Algernon.
- No.

37:19.560 --> 37:22.791
Nor Sigismund, or Egbert, or Beowulf.

37:22.880 --> 37:25.348
Algernon's been in the family for generations.

37:25.440 --> 37:29.069
My great-grandfather was an Algernon
and every Gifford since.

37:29.160 --> 37:33.199
- lt's Pete's middle name.
- And they never let me forget it at school.

37:33.280 --> 37:34.872
What's wrong with Algernon?

37:34.960 --> 37:39.795
lt's ugly, it's old-fashioned,
and in its shortened form it means pond scum!

37:39.880 --> 37:42.348
- That was his nickname.
- lt's our heritage!

37:43.080 --> 37:45.640
- Do you want to destroy that?
- Apparently.

37:45.720 --> 37:48.712
'Ey, we could add it after Preston.

37:49.680 --> 37:51.875
- Yeah!
- No. No way.

37:51.960 --> 37:53.712
One daft name's enough.

37:53.800 --> 37:58.078
Besides, he's not having four initials.
People will think he's upper class.

38:02.680 --> 38:05.240
Then you won't see us at the christening.

38:21.880 --> 38:25.111
- (Ramona sobs) ..l say to him.
KAREN: l don't want to know!

38:25.200 --> 38:27.156
(Ramona sobs hysterically)

38:27.960 --> 38:31.111
- l'm not bloody interested, Ramona.
- But it's not true!

38:31.200 --> 38:34.317
l don't care, Ramona!
You should have thought of that before!

38:34.400 --> 38:36.675
But l ask him to help...

38:36.760 --> 38:38.113
David!

38:38.840 --> 38:40.478
(Sobs)

38:40.560 --> 38:43.870
- Have you told her to pay for her phone calls?
- l fired her.

38:43.960 --> 38:45.075
Why?

38:46.760 --> 38:48.716
Because she's having an affair.

38:49.840 --> 38:51.876
She wouldn't be the first, would she?

38:52.920 --> 38:55.957
You shit! You never read my note, David!

38:57.240 --> 39:01.995
- How long have you been shagging Ramona?
- l haven't. lt was our first...or rather, it wasn't.

39:02.080 --> 39:04.389
Look, Ramona's got a crush on me, right?

39:04.480 --> 39:08.519
And l, well...l thought l'd take advantage,
since you've been shagging Alec Welcht.

39:08.600 --> 39:12.229
- What?
- Don't deny it, Karen. Adam told me everything.

39:12.320 --> 39:14.470
Adam? Your source was Adam?

39:14.560 --> 39:17.154
Who got it from Rachel.
Who presumably got it from you.

39:17.240 --> 39:19.196
David, l never slept with Alec.

39:19.960 --> 39:24.954
l won't pretend it didn't cross my mind - that's
what l told Rachel - but it never happened.

39:26.280 --> 39:28.236
l think he prefers younger women.

39:29.280 --> 39:31.236
l see.

39:31.320 --> 39:34.551
- But you thought about it, didn't you?
- Yes, l did, David.

39:36.320 --> 39:39.039
He paid me attention. He flattered me.

39:39.120 --> 39:40.678
l can flatter you.

39:45.120 --> 39:47.236
You've got a great throwing arm.

39:52.320 --> 39:56.279
l'd hoped Pete would inherit his father's looks,
not his temperament.

39:57.640 --> 40:00.029
Audrey, um...

40:02.040 --> 40:04.838
Really sorry...l held a knife on you.

40:04.920 --> 40:06.672
That's all right, dear.

40:07.680 --> 40:10.319
You've always been a little bit excitable.

40:14.800 --> 40:17.712
Pete's really upset
that you won't be at the christening.

40:17.800 --> 40:19.836
- Oh, we will.
- Eh?

40:19.920 --> 40:23.799
When Pete wants one thing
and you want another, who wins?

40:25.800 --> 40:27.472
Moi!

40:28.800 --> 40:31.758
They say men marry their mothers.

40:32.760 --> 40:34.512
Oh, no. (Laughs)

40:34.600 --> 40:36.113
Bye, love.

40:36.840 --> 40:38.319
See you, Mum.

40:38.400 --> 40:40.356
- Bye-bye, love.
- Bye.

40:40.440 --> 40:42.317
- Look after my grandson.
- Yeah.

40:43.040 --> 40:44.996
And my son.

40:48.240 --> 40:50.196
JENNY: Bye.

40:52.840 --> 40:54.558
- Pete.
- Yeah?

40:54.640 --> 40:56.596
Which way to the A34?

40:58.160 --> 40:59.673
A34?

41:01.400 --> 41:03.038
Right.

41:04.840 --> 41:06.796
Obstinate sod!

41:06.880 --> 41:08.836
Don't you turn left for the A34?

41:16.760 --> 41:18.716
- Oh, dear.
- Oh, that's awful.

41:18.800 --> 41:20.756
Awful.

41:20.840 --> 41:23.070
- l should have listened to you.
- Mm.

41:23.160 --> 41:25.469
- l shouldn't have said anything to Adam.
- No.

41:25.560 --> 41:27.278
l'm sorry.

41:28.280 --> 41:32.114
- How did you get Ramona to stay on?
- An apology and a pay rise.

41:33.360 --> 41:35.555
You should get Adam to contribute.

41:35.640 --> 41:38.313
Oh, l'm not the vindictive kind, Rachel.

41:39.520 --> 41:41.476
- Hi, girls.
- Adam.

41:43.840 --> 41:45.796
Have you finished it already?

41:46.520 --> 41:48.476
Well, there were no long words.

41:48.560 --> 41:50.516
Karen, l want you to be brutal.

41:50.600 --> 41:54.036
l know we're friends,
but l value your professional opinion.

41:54.120 --> 41:56.076
What can l say, Adam? lt left me...

41:56.840 --> 41:58.558
Speechless.

41:59.280 --> 42:02.352
lt reminds me of what
Truman Capote said of Jack Kerouac.

42:02.440 --> 42:04.078
- Really?
- Mm.

42:04.160 --> 42:06.799
''This isn't writing, it's typing.''

42:08.080 --> 42:10.548
ln your case, it's not even good typing.

42:11.520 --> 42:14.398
Um...when l said ''brutal'', um...

42:14.480 --> 42:18.029
There's a simile in chapter five l quite liked,
though it's not original.

42:18.120 --> 42:20.554
The rest is just wastepaper.

42:25.000 --> 42:28.197
l um...think l'll...get myself a drink.

42:28.400 --> 42:30.595
Best make it a double, eh?

42:30.680 --> 42:32.398
l haven't finished yet.

42:35.600 --> 42:37.556
(Organ music)

42:46.600 --> 42:48.511
Quickly.

42:48.600 --> 42:50.556
All right, all right. Careful.

42:52.360 --> 42:54.316
- Hi.
- Sorry we're late.

42:54.400 --> 42:56.356
- Hi.
- Hi.

42:57.360 --> 42:59.237
For you.

42:59.320 --> 43:01.880
We're accepting gifts after the christening.

43:01.960 --> 43:03.757
lt's my novel.

43:05.720 --> 43:08.359
l decided friendship
was more important than fame.

43:10.760 --> 43:12.671
Denis Law?

43:15.480 --> 43:17.198
Anyway, Karen said it was shite.

43:18.280 --> 43:20.748
ls there any sign of your parents yet?

43:20.840 --> 43:22.353
No.

43:22.440 --> 43:24.715
They'll be here. Your mum promised.

43:24.800 --> 43:26.756
You might want to move inside now?

43:38.520 --> 43:41.318
l'm Sheila. Jenny's sister.

43:41.400 --> 43:43.868
- The Christian?
- Of course.

43:43.960 --> 43:46.076
As godfather, aren't you?

43:47.600 --> 43:49.795
- Have you got him a present?
- A Bible.

43:51.400 --> 43:53.436
Oh, you haven't as well?

43:54.480 --> 43:56.550
l was this close to, but...no.

43:57.280 --> 43:59.350
l got him a Peter Rabbit bowl and mug.

44:03.960 --> 44:05.916
lt's Wedgwood.

44:06.840 --> 44:08.796
Hiya. ls David not with you?

44:08.880 --> 44:11.235
No, he's on the phone. Some deal with Tokyo.

44:12.080 --> 44:14.036
Are we the last?

44:14.120 --> 44:15.838
Possibly.

44:17.960 --> 44:21.919
Hai. Watashiwa Tokyoe ikimasu...

44:24.520 --> 44:26.431
Er, next week.

44:26.520 --> 44:28.715
You don't speak Japanese, do you?

44:28.800 --> 44:30.756
Yes. As a matter of fact, l do.

44:32.800 --> 44:36.236
Perfect. Could you tell him
l'm going to be in Tokyo next week?

44:36.960 --> 44:38.712
Moshi moshi. Odenwa kaerimashita.

44:38.800 --> 44:41.439
SHElLA:
And if your hand causes you to sin,

44:42.800 --> 44:44.392
cut it off.

44:44.480 --> 44:46.869
lt is better for you to enter life maimed

44:46.960 --> 44:50.794
than with two hands
to go to hell to the unquenchable fire.

44:51.880 --> 44:54.917
And if your eye causes you to sin,

44:55.880 --> 44:57.472
pluck it out.

44:58.440 --> 45:02.194
lt is better for you to enter
the kingdom of God with one eye

45:03.000 --> 45:05.753
than with two eyes to be thrown into hell.

45:10.440 --> 45:15.195
We're now going to hear from Adam's
godfather and namesake Adam Williams.

45:16.560 --> 45:18.312
Brilliant.

45:19.760 --> 45:21.716
- Arigato.
- Doo itashimashite.

45:23.840 --> 45:26.035
ADAM: l'm quite nervous, actually.

45:27.680 --> 45:29.636
A lot of eyes looking at me.

45:30.440 --> 45:34.228
Um...no-one's ever asked me
to be a godfather before.

45:35.440 --> 45:37.396
l can't see why not.

45:38.400 --> 45:42.678
And so l'm especially proud
that my best friends have.

45:45.120 --> 45:47.953
l've got some notes here somewhere.

45:50.680 --> 45:53.797
When a baby's born er...everything changes.

45:55.080 --> 45:57.036
Families change.

45:57.680 --> 45:59.716
Everyone else moves up a generation.

46:00.760 --> 46:03.877
Pete...who is a son...

46:03.960 --> 46:05.951
(Mobile rings)
- ..is now also a father.

46:09.080 --> 46:10.593
Yeah?

46:10.680 --> 46:12.636
Hai. Hai.

46:12.720 --> 46:14.676
Er... (Snaps fingers)

46:16.640 --> 46:18.710
Um... Where was l? Er...

46:18.800 --> 46:20.756
Oh, yeah, fathers and sons.

46:21.800 --> 46:27.113
l asked Pete's dad - Algy -
what it had been like for him to be a father.

46:27.200 --> 46:28.918
This is going to be good.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.070
And er...he sent me this.

46:36.680 --> 46:41.196
''lnevitably parents love their children
more than their children love them.

46:43.440 --> 46:47.592
A father looks at a son and sees part of himself.

46:48.960 --> 46:51.793
They say, 'Be careful what you wish for.'

46:52.600 --> 46:57.993
My wish for my son was that he grew up
independent of mind and strong of will.

46:59.040 --> 47:01.190
That he has drives me mad.

47:02.600 --> 47:04.556
lt also fills me with pride.''

47:04.640 --> 47:07.108
Yeah? Well, why didn't the old git turn up, then?

47:07.200 --> 47:09.998
''l know that Pete will be a good father.

47:11.320 --> 47:13.276
l've seen the way he looks at his son -

47:14.840 --> 47:16.796
with love.

47:17.800 --> 47:24.592
A love that only a father can recognise, and
which l recognise, cos that's how l look at Pete.

47:25.360 --> 47:28.079
(Mobile rings)
ADAM: Oh, for God's sake!

47:28.160 --> 47:30.720
You shouldn't blaspheme in church.

47:30.800 --> 47:33.075
And you shouldn't heckle.

47:33.160 --> 47:34.912
Hello?

47:38.480 --> 47:40.232
OK, Mum.

47:42.680 --> 47:44.636
What is it, Pete?

47:45.720 --> 47:47.472
My dad.

47:47.560 --> 47:49.516
He's dead.

48:09.840 --> 48:11.796
lronic, really.

48:12.600 --> 48:14.556
Your father never went to church.

48:16.080 --> 48:18.435
Then he has a heart attack
on his way to one.

48:20.600 --> 48:22.556
l'm going to be a good dad to him.

48:24.160 --> 48:26.116
l wanted to be to you.

48:30.120 --> 48:32.076
He never knew how much l loved him.

48:32.560 --> 48:34.516
Yes, he did.

48:35.880 --> 48:38.394
You just had a funny way of showing it, love.

48:38.480 --> 48:40.311
- Look after my grandson.
- Yeah.

48:41.040 --> 48:42.996
And my son.

48:47.520 --> 48:49.476
You're just like him.

48:50.800 --> 48:52.552
Come on.
