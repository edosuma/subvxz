Ha-har.

01:02.095 --> 01:03.662
Ahoy, mateys.

01:03.664 --> 01:06.298
Do you want to join
my pirate crew?

01:07.734 --> 01:08.734
Great.

01:08.736 --> 01:10.402
To start today's adventure,

01:10.404 --> 01:13.172
everybody say
the Pirate Password:

01:13.174 --> 01:15.207
Yo-ho ho.

01:15.209 --> 01:18.277
- [all] Yo-ho ho.
- One more time.

01:18.279 --> 01:20.312
Yo-ho ho.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.318
<i>[Jake]</i> The mystery pirate!

01:26.320 --> 01:30.589
Aw, coconuts! I was gonna
make a coconut milkshake,

01:30.591 --> 01:34.193
but this is one
tough nut to crack!

01:35.528 --> 01:38.397
- Crackers!
- Stand back, Cubby.

01:38.399 --> 01:41.433
Maybe I can solve this
nutty pirate problem.

01:41.435 --> 01:42.701
Be careful, Jake!

01:45.338 --> 01:47.439
Hey! Where's my sword?

01:47.441 --> 01:51.210
- [laughter]
- Shiver me timbers!

01:51.212 --> 01:53.779
That pirate just took off
with your sword!

01:55.648 --> 01:57.282
Ha!

01:57.284 --> 02:00.419
Whoa! Check out those moves!

02:00.421 --> 02:02.421
Who is that mystery pirate?

02:02.423 --> 02:04.857
It's definitely
not Captain Hook.

02:04.859 --> 02:08.260
Mateys, wanna find out
who the mystery pirate is,

02:08.262 --> 02:10.429
and help me get my sword back?

02:11.865 --> 02:15.234
Great! Keep a lookout
for gold doubloons.

02:15.236 --> 02:17.236
Whenever we solve
a Pirate Problem together,

02:17.238 --> 02:19.271
they'll appear.
Then we'll collect 'em

02:19.273 --> 02:21.406
and put 'em in our
Team Treasure Chest.

02:21.408 --> 02:23.142
Is everybody ready?

02:23.144 --> 02:24.643
I got my map.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.745
I've got my Pixie Dust.

02:26.747 --> 02:29.181
Well, I don't have my sword,

02:29.183 --> 02:33.619
so yo-ho, let's go get it back!

02:33.621 --> 02:36.889
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys, away! </i>

02:36.891 --> 02:39.558
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

02:39.560 --> 02:44.263
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

02:44.265 --> 02:47.332
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

02:47.334 --> 02:49.535
<i>¶ And me </i>

02:52.238 --> 02:56.742
Oh, my! I was certain that
the <i>Jolly Roger</i> was this way.

02:56.744 --> 03:01.180
Mr. Smee, it's bad enough we
didn't find any treasure today.

03:01.182 --> 03:04.483
Now you can't even find
the way back to me ship!

03:04.485 --> 03:08.754
Mayhaps you can tell us the way,
oh wise captain?

03:08.756 --> 03:11.223
Oh! Do tell! Do tell!

03:11.225 --> 03:15.627
Why, of course, boys.
We simply go to the left...

03:15.629 --> 03:19.531
Oh. Uh...
What in plunder was that?!

03:19.533 --> 03:23.569
[gasps] Oh my, cap'n!
Your hook, it's gone!

03:23.571 --> 03:26.238
- What?!
- And that pirate with the mask

03:26.240 --> 03:28.507
be the sneaky one
who gone and took it!

03:28.509 --> 03:31.243
Oh-ho-ho!

03:31.245 --> 03:33.512
Scurvy, thievin' swab!

03:33.514 --> 03:36.748
How dare you take what
does not belong to you!

03:36.750 --> 03:38.984
[Skully] Now you know
how it feels, Hook!

03:38.986 --> 03:41.553
What?! Puny pirates!

03:41.555 --> 03:44.389
I should have known
you were behind this.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.358
Slow down, Captain Hook.

03:46.360 --> 03:49.328
That mystery pirate
didn't just take your hook.

03:49.330 --> 03:52.631
- Whoever it is took my sword!
- Oh, dear!

03:52.633 --> 03:56.368
There might be a sneakier
snook than you, sir...

03:56.370 --> 03:59.972
Uh, I mean, we must
stop this masked menace!

03:59.974 --> 04:03.508
You know, Captain Hook,
I bet we could get your hook

04:03.510 --> 04:06.345
and my sword back
if we work together.

04:06.347 --> 04:09.982
Captain Hook does not
"work together!"

04:09.984 --> 04:11.850
Just stay out of me way!

04:11.852 --> 04:14.286
Follow me, men!

04:16.356 --> 04:17.556
Blast!

04:20.426 --> 04:23.428
[laughing]

04:23.430 --> 04:25.864
[Skully] The mystery pirate
went this-a-way!

04:25.866 --> 04:29.268
- A-ha!
- Look alive, me hearties!

04:32.438 --> 04:34.940
Rotten codfish!

04:34.942 --> 04:38.844
Now how are we going to get
across this mud pool?

04:38.846 --> 04:43.315
I've got an idea. We can
swing across on these vines.

04:43.317 --> 04:46.451
Let's take turns,
one pirate at a time.

04:46.453 --> 04:50.355
Captain Hook does not work
together or take turns!

04:50.357 --> 04:52.924
Everybody knows that!
Step lively, men!

04:54.360 --> 04:58.730
- All hands on vine!
- [all] Aye, aye, cap'n!

04:58.732 --> 05:01.466
[grunting]

05:02.735 --> 05:04.836
[splashing]

05:05.471 --> 05:06.705
Come on, mateys!

05:06.707 --> 05:10.075
Let's take turns,
one pirate at a time.

05:10.077 --> 05:12.878
Yeah!

05:13.813 --> 05:16.481
[grunting] Yahoo!

05:17.484 --> 05:22.487
We made it across the mud
and got two gold doubloons!

05:22.489 --> 05:24.856
Let's grab 'em
and go help out Hook.

05:25.692 --> 05:30.395
Blasted bubbling bilge water!

05:31.064 --> 05:33.398
You can thank us later, Hook.

05:33.400 --> 05:36.735
[mystery pirate laughing]

05:36.737 --> 05:40.439
Push on, mates. We've got
a mystery pirate to catch!

05:40.441 --> 05:43.108
Not if I catch
the scoundrel first.

05:47.947 --> 05:51.950
<i>¶ Who be that pirate?</i>
<i>It's a mystery ¶</i>

05:51.952 --> 05:56.088
<i>¶ I hope he doesn't jump</i>
<i>out now and frighten me ¶</i>

05:56.090 --> 05:58.857
<i>¶ He'll swipe your stuff</i>
<i>and then he scrammies ¶</i>

05:58.859 --> 06:00.992
<i>¶ Who's that</i>
<i>in them black pajamies? ¶</i>

06:00.994 --> 06:04.830
<i>¶ Who be that pirate?</i>
<i>It's a mystery ¶</i>

06:04.832 --> 06:07.032
<i>- ¶ Hi-yah </i>
<i>-</i> [mystery pirate laughs]

06:07.034 --> 06:10.402
Swash me buckle!
There be the mystery pirate!

06:10.404 --> 06:11.970
[Hook] Pipe down!

06:11.972 --> 06:16.875
We've got that masked marauder
just where we want him.

06:16.877 --> 06:20.812
Come on, mateys, let's go get
that sneakier-than-Hook snook!

06:20.814 --> 06:24.416
Hold up, Cubby. I'm not so sure
that's the mystery pirate.

06:24.418 --> 06:27.052
Looks kind of wobbly.
This could be a trap.

06:27.054 --> 06:31.556
Well, if it is a trap,
it doesn't look like Hook
is too worried about it.

06:31.558 --> 06:35.527
- Charge!
- [all grunting]

06:36.696 --> 06:38.663
Uh, beg pardon, cap'n,

06:38.665 --> 06:41.433
but I don't think this
is the mystery pirate.

06:41.435 --> 06:45.704
Of course it isn't!
Which means this must be a...

06:45.706 --> 06:49.508
- ...trap!
- [mystery pirate laughs]

06:49.510 --> 06:53.745
Way-hey! For avoiding
the mystery pirate's trap,

06:53.747 --> 06:56.081
we got three more
gold doubloons!

06:56.083 --> 06:59.584
Let's grab 'em and go
help Hook outta that net.

07:00.520 --> 07:02.687
Ahoy, Hook!
You need any help?

07:02.689 --> 07:07.926
From puny pirates?
Absolutely not!

07:07.928 --> 07:11.096
OK, if you say so.

07:12.465 --> 07:15.434
Oh... excuse me, cap'n,

07:15.436 --> 07:18.637
but maybe we should've
let the sea pups help us.

07:18.639 --> 07:23.975
Oh, nonsense! I'll have us down
faster than you can say...

07:23.977 --> 07:25.710
- [tearing]
- [all shouting]

07:25.712 --> 07:27.546
[thudding]

07:31.117 --> 07:33.618
[Skully] Move it, mateys!

07:34.954 --> 07:39.558
- Yo-ho, let's go!
- [Jake] Not so fast, mateys.

07:39.560 --> 07:43.061
Captain Hook wants to find that
mystery pirate as much as we do.

07:43.063 --> 07:46.565
- We oughta wait for him.
- But he wouldn't
do that for us!

07:46.567 --> 07:50.735
Maybe not. But he's not like us
and we're not like him.

07:50.737 --> 07:53.472
- You waited for me?
- Of course.

07:53.474 --> 07:55.774
It was the right thing to do,
Captain Hook.

07:55.776 --> 08:00.512
- But why?
- Because if we're ever going
to catch the mystery pirate,

08:00.514 --> 08:05.116
- we need to work together.
- Work... together?

08:05.118 --> 08:07.719
[sighs] Oh, very well.

08:07.721 --> 08:10.255
Just try not to get in me way.

08:10.257 --> 08:12.724
Forward! Faster!

08:12.726 --> 08:14.626
Doubley-quick!

08:14.628 --> 08:17.529
- I said faster, boys!
- Whoa!

08:17.531 --> 08:21.500
- Slow down, Captain Hook!
- Don't listen
to the puny pirate.

08:21.502 --> 08:24.603
Listen to me! Paddle on!

08:24.605 --> 08:30.075
- [mystery pirate laughs]
- That hook and sword swiping
pirate is going that way!

08:30.077 --> 08:32.677
We need to turn
this raft around.

08:32.679 --> 08:35.814
Yay-hey, no way!
The current's too strong!

08:35.816 --> 08:41.520
- Waterfall, ho!
- [Smee] Oh, my, we're doomed!

08:41.522 --> 08:45.023
Wait! I've got a splendid idea!

08:45.025 --> 08:48.894
We can use me fishing hook
to get out of this.

08:50.930 --> 08:53.698
[Jake] Yo-ho,
way to go, Captain Hook!

08:53.700 --> 08:57.002
It was nothing, really.
Whoa! Help!

08:57.004 --> 08:59.671
I got you!
But who's got me?!

08:59.673 --> 09:02.707
Let us work together, pirates!

09:02.709 --> 09:05.977
- Everyone grab hold!
- Hang on, mates!

09:05.979 --> 09:08.580
[all grunting]

09:11.183 --> 09:14.219
We... we...
we did it.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.555
[both] Together!

09:17.590 --> 09:19.724
All right!
We worked together

09:19.726 --> 09:21.660
to save ourselves
from the falls,

09:21.662 --> 09:24.329
and we got five
more gold doubloons!

09:24.331 --> 09:26.731
Let's grab 'em
and go catch up to...

09:26.733 --> 09:28.667
The mystery pirate!

09:28.669 --> 09:31.703
[chortling]

09:31.705 --> 09:37.175
Quickly! Before that
blasted sword-and-hook
thief can get away again,

09:37.177 --> 09:40.946
do that magic
dusty thing you do!

09:40.948 --> 09:44.249
- This is an emergency!
- You got it!

09:44.251 --> 09:46.251
Pixie Dust away!

09:50.590 --> 09:55.260
Ha-har! Well done, me hearties!

09:56.729 --> 09:58.063
[all] Mama Hook?

09:58.065 --> 10:00.599
The mystery pirate is...

10:00.601 --> 10:02.367
...me mummy?!

10:02.369 --> 10:08.373
[stammers] I never knew
you were so fast and sneaky
and swashbuckle-y!

10:08.375 --> 10:12.811
Oh, James -- there's more
to this little ol' pirate gal

10:12.813 --> 10:16.781
- than meets the eye!
- But why did you
steal my sword?

10:16.783 --> 10:21.653
- And my hook?
- These? Oh, sorry about that.

10:21.655 --> 10:25.690
But taking them was part of
my little plan to show my son

10:25.692 --> 10:29.027
that it's better to work
together with others.

10:29.029 --> 10:33.632
And I did just that,
didn't I, Mummy?

10:33.634 --> 10:35.834
Oh, yes, you did, James.

10:35.836 --> 10:38.737
Why, it warms
a mama buccaneer's heart!

10:38.739 --> 10:42.407
And I am so proud
of both of you!

10:42.409 --> 10:47.145
Like I always say,
a good pirate should always
be ready to lend a hand.

10:47.147 --> 10:50.715
- [both] Or a hook!
- [laughing]

10:52.418 --> 10:55.754
Thanks for helping us
find out who the
mystery pirate was, mateys!

10:55.756 --> 10:59.991
Now let's put all our
gold doubloons into
our Team Treasure Chest.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.834
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

11:09.836 --> 11:11.670
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

11:11.672 --> 11:13.772
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>with help from you ¶</i>

11:13.774 --> 11:16.675
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons ¶</i>

11:16.677 --> 11:18.877
Come on, count with us.

11:19.979 --> 11:21.413
[all] Yeah!

11:21.415 --> 11:24.849
[Izzy] One, two, three...

11:24.851 --> 11:27.118
[Cubby] Four, five, six...

11:27.120 --> 11:30.321
[Jake] Seven, eight, nine, ten.

11:30.323 --> 11:33.258
Yay-hey! For solving
Pirate Problems today,

11:33.260 --> 11:36.094
we got ten
gold doubloons.

11:36.096 --> 11:40.865
And now we can finally
crack open this coconut, Jake!

11:42.768 --> 11:44.936
My sword! Where did it go?

11:44.938 --> 11:48.873
Catch me if you can!
I'm the mystery pirate parrot!

11:48.875 --> 11:51.810
- All right!
- Hey, come back, Skully!

11:51.812 --> 11:54.212
[all shouting, laughing]

11:55.915 --> 11:57.949
James, hold still.

11:57.951 --> 12:01.886
I thought you had learned
the value of working together.

12:01.888 --> 12:05.223
But, Mummy,
this is embarrassing.

12:05.225 --> 12:08.727
- Nonsense!
- Pink be your color, cap'n!

12:08.729 --> 12:12.864
- [laughs]
- [groans] Pink.

12:15.468 --> 12:17.869
<i>[Jake]</i> Pirate Swap!

12:17.871 --> 12:19.404
[Skully] Look alive,
me hearties!

12:20.773 --> 12:23.742
- G'day, Skully!
- Not just any day,

12:23.744 --> 12:27.912
- Pirate Swap Day!
- Ahoy, sea pups!

12:27.914 --> 12:32.383
- Pirate Swap Day is upon us.
- Oh, goodie.

12:32.385 --> 12:36.354
I have never understood the
point of this preposterous day.

12:36.356 --> 12:38.389
It's all in the Pirate Code.

12:38.391 --> 12:41.860
"On this special day,
each pirate crew in Never Land

12:41.862 --> 12:43.862
swaps one matey for another.

12:43.864 --> 12:47.532
And all their mateys will
learn new pirate-y ways."

12:47.534 --> 12:52.337
Oh, bah! I shall never learn
a thing from any puny pirate.

12:52.339 --> 12:54.405
We'll see, Captain Hook.

12:54.407 --> 12:58.176
Mateys, want to join us
for Pirate Swap Day?

12:59.879 --> 13:02.781
Great! Keep a lookout
for gold doubloons.

13:02.783 --> 13:06.251
Whenever we solve
a Pirate Problem together,
they'll appear.

13:06.253 --> 13:09.387
Then we'll collect 'em and put
'em in our Team Treasure Chest.

13:09.389 --> 13:13.792
But however shall we pick
which pirates to swap?

13:13.794 --> 13:18.496
Jake and Captain Hook
can pick names out
of these coconut shells.

13:19.231 --> 13:22.267
My crew gets... Bones!

13:22.269 --> 13:24.169
Pirates be praised!

13:24.171 --> 13:27.438
A day away from ol'
sourpuss Captain H...

13:27.440 --> 13:32.377
[wheezing] I mean,
I shall really miss me crew.

13:32.379 --> 13:36.214
- Your turn, Captain Hook.
- Yes, yes.

13:36.216 --> 13:39.384
Me crew gets... Cubby?!

13:39.386 --> 13:44.289
Aw, coconuts!
I gotta sail with Captain Hook?

13:44.291 --> 13:47.992
- You'll be fine, Cubby.
- But we're talkin' Hook.

13:47.994 --> 13:51.229
Never Land's
most wanted cranky crook!

13:51.231 --> 13:56.534
Exactly. A pirate like him
could really learn a thing
or two from a matey like you.

13:56.536 --> 13:59.337
Plus, you never know,
you might have fun.

13:59.339 --> 14:04.142
- And it's only for the day.
- I guess that's not too bad.

14:04.144 --> 14:08.446
Step lively, men...
and puny pirate.

14:09.582 --> 14:11.516
So long, mateys.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.318
- So long!
- Later!

14:13.320 --> 14:15.520
- Bye-bye!
- Have fun!

14:18.324 --> 14:22.594
- [ringing]
<i>- ¶ Yo-ho, mateys, away! </i>

14:22.596 --> 14:25.430
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>

14:25.432 --> 14:27.031
<i>¶ Let's go </i>

14:27.033 --> 14:29.901
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

14:29.903 --> 14:32.937
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>

14:32.939 --> 14:36.007
<i>- ¶ And me </i>

14:37.443 --> 14:39.944
All hands, come and get it!

14:39.946 --> 14:44.382
Aw, coconuts!
What's that smell?!

14:44.384 --> 14:46.484
Ship's specialty:

14:46.486 --> 14:50.521
Stinky fishtail stew
with a side o' rotten fruit.

14:50.523 --> 14:55.159
Gross! Mr. Smee,
may I use your galley?

14:55.161 --> 14:59.464
- Oh, help yourself, sea pup.
- The insolence!

14:59.466 --> 15:04.602
Well, he left. I claim his
portion of stinky stew...

15:04.604 --> 15:08.006
My, my, what have we here?

15:08.008 --> 15:12.043
Only the best food ever:
fresh fruit!

15:12.045 --> 15:15.947
- [sniffs]
- Fresh, you say?

15:15.949 --> 15:20.418
- Astoundingly delicious!
- [chuckles] See, Cap'n?

15:20.420 --> 15:23.588
Pirate Swap Day has taught us
something already.

15:23.590 --> 15:26.624
What? [babbles]

15:26.626 --> 15:30.028
No, it hasn't!
Enough of this fresh stuff.

15:30.030 --> 15:33.431
I want me stinky fishtail stew!

15:35.100 --> 15:36.968
[shudders]

15:38.037 --> 15:41.005
Ahoy, mateys, lunch is served!

15:41.007 --> 15:46.177
Uh, where's the food? [sniffs]
I can't smell anything stinky.

15:46.179 --> 15:50.448
That's because it's all fresh.
Fruit, berries, granola.

15:50.450 --> 15:54.686
- Oh, yummy!
- [slurping]

15:54.688 --> 15:57.121
How strange.

15:57.123 --> 15:59.691
- And wonderful!
- [laughs]

16:01.293 --> 16:04.128
Time for you swabs
to swab the deck!

16:04.130 --> 16:08.066
I want it shiny enough
to see me own reflection!

16:08.068 --> 16:11.569
Oh, my!
We'd better get to swabbin'!

16:11.571 --> 16:13.137
Isn't Captain Hook gonna help?

16:13.139 --> 16:15.039
The cap'n? [laughs]

16:15.041 --> 16:17.575
Help? [wheezing laughter]

16:17.577 --> 16:19.043
We'll see.

16:20.212 --> 16:21.646
Check it out!

16:25.751 --> 16:28.152
He shoots...

16:28.154 --> 16:30.154
- [buzzer sounds]
- ...he scores!

16:30.156 --> 16:32.457
I love swab-shuffle-hockey!

16:32.459 --> 16:35.159
Oh, gracious!

16:35.161 --> 16:37.228
- Slap-shot!
- Pass it here!

16:37.230 --> 16:39.364
Fun is being had.

16:39.366 --> 16:43.735
I demand to be let into
this enjoyable pastime.

16:43.737 --> 16:47.105
- [gasps] Ow! Ah!
- Comin' atcha, Cap!

16:47.107 --> 16:49.741
- Ah!
- [grunting]

16:52.111 --> 16:54.178
Captain Hook! You did it!

16:54.180 --> 16:57.515
You scored
a swab-shuffle-hockey goal!

16:57.517 --> 17:02.186
Bravo. And me deck is shiny.

17:02.188 --> 17:07.258
Do me eyes deceive me? Cap'n
Hook helpin' with the chores?

17:07.260 --> 17:10.294
And havin'
a good time doin' it!

17:12.164 --> 17:14.332
Jagged rocks dead ahead!

17:14.334 --> 17:19.303
Izzy, spin the wheel
to the right! Bones!
We need more sail!

17:20.205 --> 17:22.473
Yo-ho, way to go, mateys!

17:22.475 --> 17:26.277
- [bell rings]
- We worked together
and missed the rocks.

17:26.279 --> 17:29.714
This calls for a song.
Pull out your instruments.

17:29.716 --> 17:34.085
- But... we don't have any.
- Sure you do!

17:34.087 --> 17:36.788
Anything aboard ship
can be an instrument.

17:36.790 --> 17:39.724
- Here's a drum-diddley-dum.
- I get it.

17:39.726 --> 17:42.560
And this mop
can be a bass guitar!

17:42.562 --> 17:46.497
- And these spoons make great...
- [clicking]

17:46.499 --> 17:51.469
- ...spoons!
- [music plays]

17:51.471 --> 17:56.140
Now you've got it, mates!
We'll be shipshape in no time!

17:56.142 --> 17:59.811
<i>¶ To sail away</i>
<i>You need the wind to blow ¶</i>

17:59.813 --> 18:03.114
<i>¶ To plot a course</i>
<i>You need a place to go ¶</i>

18:03.116 --> 18:06.517
<i>¶ To raise the anchor</i>
<i>You can't do that alone ¶</i>

18:06.519 --> 18:09.420
<i>¶ You need your mates</i>
<i>to help you pull ¶</i>

18:09.422 --> 18:13.658
<i>- ¶ Let's get shipshape </i>
<i>- ¶ 'Cause we can</i>
<i>work together ¶</i>

18:13.660 --> 18:17.261
<i>- ¶ Shipshape </i>
<i>- ¶ Now we're</i>
<i>workin' as a team ¶</i>

18:17.263 --> 18:20.698

<i>- ¶ When we're sailin'</i>
<i>on the high tide ¶</i>

18:20.700 --> 18:23.734
<i>¶ It takes me and you </i>

18:23.736 --> 18:27.271
<i>¶ To make a pirate crew </i>

18:27.273 --> 18:33.244
<i>¶ La-la-la-la-la-la </i>

18:33.246 --> 18:35.146
Rockin' tune, Bones!

18:35.148 --> 18:37.882
Thanks for showin' us
these cool instruments.

18:37.884 --> 18:43.254
[laughs] 'Twas me pleasure!
You mates play great together.

18:45.257 --> 18:47.225
According to the Pirate Code,

18:47.227 --> 18:51.863
the Welcome Back Matey ceremony
is held at Big Stone Circle.

18:51.865 --> 18:54.732
I know it well!
This way, men!

18:54.734 --> 18:57.301
Um, Captain Hook, my map,

18:57.303 --> 19:00.371
uh, sort of shows...
a shortcut.

19:00.373 --> 19:03.141
Oh, it does, does it?

19:03.143 --> 19:09.213
Uh, Cap'n, sir, you know how
you love a nice shortcut.

19:09.215 --> 19:13.851
Fine. Lead the way, popinjay.

19:14.353 --> 19:16.287
Oh, coconuts!

19:16.289 --> 19:19.390
- [grunting]
- What is the holdup?

19:19.392 --> 19:24.829
- [grunting]
- [stammering] Great apes!
That beast is huge!

19:24.831 --> 19:27.832
[stammering] Should we... run?

19:27.834 --> 19:29.767
We're all scared.

19:29.769 --> 19:32.737
But if my mateys were here,
they'd say,

19:32.739 --> 19:36.340
"Keep calm, Cubby.
We're right here with ya!"

19:36.342 --> 19:41.646
Soothing words indeed.
But how do you propose
we pass that beast?

19:41.648 --> 19:46.250
Hey! Almost forgot! I brought
along some of my lunch!

19:46.252 --> 19:47.618
Here ya go, boy!

19:49.188 --> 19:52.256
[grunting]

19:54.893 --> 19:58.362
[Cubby] Now's our chance!
Yo-ho, let's go!

19:59.831 --> 20:04.302
Jumpin' guppies!
Look at the size of that monkey!

20:04.304 --> 20:07.605
Actually, Skully,
gorillas are apes not monkeys.

20:07.607 --> 20:11.943
- How can we get past him?
- Well, I read once that
gorillas like to be tickled

20:11.945 --> 20:16.314
- behind the ear.
- We need some
kind of a feather.

20:16.316 --> 20:20.985
- Skully?
- I didn't see that coming.

20:20.987 --> 20:26.324
- [grunting, laughing]
- Now's our chance!
Yo-ho, let's go!

20:27.359 --> 20:29.860
We did it!
We got past the gorilla

20:29.862 --> 20:33.698
and got eight gold doubloons!
Let's grab 'em and go!

20:34.733 --> 20:37.268
Bones, the last two are yours.

20:37.270 --> 20:38.369
You earned 'em!

20:39.338 --> 20:41.305
Shiver me timbers.

20:41.307 --> 20:42.907
Thanks!

20:44.643 --> 20:48.479
Welcome, mateys, to the
Welcome Back Mateys ceremony!

20:48.481 --> 20:53.884
According to the Pirate Code,
we're supposed to swap tales
of what we learned today.

20:53.886 --> 20:58.422
I'll go first. I gotta say,
having Bones on the crew
taught us a lot.

20:58.424 --> 21:00.358
We learned how
to make instruments.

21:00.360 --> 21:03.294
And we discovered he
knows a lot about animals.

21:03.296 --> 21:07.398
Oh, scales! T'wern't nothin'!
I'm the one who learned,

21:07.400 --> 21:12.737
all about sharing yummy food
and team-workin' together,
as a crew!

21:12.739 --> 21:14.739
I sure learned somethin'.

21:14.741 --> 21:17.275
Just 'cause you're nervous
about doin' somethin' new

21:17.277 --> 21:18.709
doesn't mean you shouldn't try.

21:18.711 --> 21:21.779
Aw, coconuts,
even bein' on Hook's crew

21:21.781 --> 21:25.549
- turned out to be fun!
- What did you learn,
Captain Hook?

21:25.551 --> 21:30.588
I learned nothing!
Crew, time to shove off!

21:32.324 --> 21:33.791
Wait, Captain Hook.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.926
I thought you might
want to keep this.

21:35.928 --> 21:39.297
You know, to remember our
swab-shuffle-hockey game.

21:39.299 --> 21:41.932
Why, thank you, puny pirate.

21:41.934 --> 21:44.402
I really did have
a good time today.

21:44.404 --> 21:47.405
- What was that, Captain Hook?
- Nothing!

21:47.407 --> 21:51.042
Good evening, popinjays.
Men, follow me!

21:51.044 --> 21:54.945
It's good having you back
on the team, Cubby.

21:56.315 --> 21:59.083
Thanks for joining us
for Pirate Swap Day, mateys.

21:59.085 --> 22:03.454
Now let's put all our
gold doubloons into
our Team Treasure Chest.

22:10.829 --> 22:13.064
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

22:13.066 --> 22:15.399
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

22:15.401 --> 22:17.401
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>with help from you ¶</i>

22:17.403 --> 22:19.937
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons ¶</i>

22:19.939 --> 22:22.340
Come on, count with us.

22:22.342 --> 22:24.909
[all] Yeah!

22:24.911 --> 22:28.512
[Izzy] One, two, three...

22:28.514 --> 22:30.915
[Cubby] Four, five, six...

22:30.917 --> 22:34.085
[Jake] Yay-hey! For solving
Pirate Problems today,

22:34.087 --> 22:37.421
we got six gold doubloons.

22:37.423 --> 22:40.925
- And Bones got two!
- What a day.

22:40.927 --> 22:43.394
I bet you're glad
that's over, Cubby!

22:43.396 --> 22:46.764
Actually, I'm gonna kinda miss
sailing with Hook and his crew,

22:46.766 --> 22:51.469
but I won't miss
their stinky food! [laughs]

22:53.372 --> 22:55.106
We are not lost, Smee!

22:55.108 --> 22:57.375
We simply don't
know where we are...

22:57.377 --> 23:00.578
- Oh!
- [gorilla grunts]

23:00.580 --> 23:03.381
Save me, Smee!

23:07.786 --> 23:10.388
¶ When the day is wrapped up

23:10.390 --> 23:12.556
<i>¶ And the ship is packed up </i>

23:12.558 --> 23:15.159
<i>¶ Jake will point the way</i>
<i>Time to sail away ¶</i>

23:15.161 --> 23:17.561
<i>¶ But before we do </i>

23:17.563 --> 23:20.097
<i>¶ Me and my whole crew </i>

23:20.099 --> 23:23.734
<i>¶ We're gonna sing</i>
<i>Farewell to you ¶</i>

23:23.736 --> 23:26.437
<i>¶ Hoist the sails</i>
<i>and let 'em go ¶</i>

23:26.439 --> 23:28.839
<i>¶ Make sure all</i>

23:28.841 --> 23:32.877
<i>¶ We'll come back</i>

<i>¶ Goodbye, crew </i>

23:37.984 --> 23:40.785
<i>¶ Farewell to you</i>
<i>Fair weather too ¶</i>

23:40.787 --> 23:43.754

23:43.756 --> 23:45.589
<i>¶ Fair winds I say to thee </i>

23:45.591 --> 23:47.558
<i>¶ We'll see you mateys</i>

23:47.560 --> 23:50.861
