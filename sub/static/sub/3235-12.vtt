00:03.469 --> 00:04.841
Let Mr. White go.
Don't kill him.

00:04.966 --> 00:07.095
- You know that won't work.
- Then you've got a problem.

00:07.224 --> 00:08.878
I've got nothing to
say to you, man.

00:10.114 --> 00:16.662
I will kill your wife. I will kill your
son. I will kill your infant daughter.

00:16.755 --> 00:19.031
You're gonna get new social's, new
identities. It's gonna cost you.

00:19.129 --> 00:20.911
I've got the money.
Now I need you to call the DEA.

00:21.018 --> 00:22.461
Gus has a hit out on Hank.

00:23.586 --> 00:25.111
Where is the money!?

00:25.186 --> 00:26.686
I gave it to Ted.

01:02.582 --> 01:03.982
They're here.
They're out front.

01:04.016 --> 01:05.016
- How many?
- Four.

01:05.051 --> 01:06.384
Nelson Brey, three others.

01:06.418 --> 01:07.918
- Did you get his toothbrush?
- Got it.

01:07.952 --> 01:10.120
What about your stuff?
Oh, you know what?

01:10.155 --> 01:13.025
We'll talk to them about
stopping at your place.

01:13.060 --> 01:14.894
Skyler-- Skyler...

01:14.929 --> 01:16.229
- What?
- I'm not going.

01:16.264 --> 01:17.500
What?

01:17.534 --> 01:18.968
I'm not going
to Hank and Marie's.

01:19.002 --> 01:20.002
I'm not going anywhere.

01:20.036 --> 01:21.137
But you said we're in danger.

01:21.172 --> 01:22.373
Yes, that's true.

01:22.407 --> 01:23.974
- Because of me.
- It doesn't matter now.

01:24.009 --> 01:25.376
All that matters is--

01:25.410 --> 01:27.244
All that matters is that
the rest of you are safe,

01:27.279 --> 01:29.080
and that's why
I'm not going with you.

01:30.249 --> 01:31.583
I'm the real target.

01:31.617 --> 01:33.486
But we'll all be safer
at Hank's.

01:33.520 --> 01:34.854
- That's--
- No, no, no.

01:34.888 --> 01:37.690
No one will be safe
at Hank's if I'm there.

01:37.724 --> 01:39.491
Walt, it's DEA.

01:40.726 --> 01:42.894
Skyler, you don't know
these people.

01:42.928 --> 01:44.495
- I--
- No, Skyler, please,

01:44.529 --> 01:45.696
trust me.

01:45.731 --> 01:47.164
This is how it has to be.

01:47.199 --> 01:49.099
Walt, those agents
outside--

01:49.134 --> 01:50.834
they're not going
to just leave you here!

01:50.869 --> 01:52.203
It's called protective custody.

01:52.237 --> 01:54.639
All they know is that
Hank is the only person

01:54.673 --> 01:56.507
that's in danger.

01:56.542 --> 01:58.809
They're including us only
as a courtesy to Marie,

01:58.844 --> 01:59.944
just to keep her happy.

01:59.978 --> 02:01.345
How am I supposed
to explain that to Marie--

02:01.379 --> 02:05.484
or Junior or Hank,
for that matter?

02:05.518 --> 02:07.953
I don't know, but you'll do it.

02:07.987 --> 02:09.354
You'll figure it out.

02:09.389 --> 02:13.226
Hank knows that Marie
will be overreacting.

02:14.728 --> 02:16.029
Except she's not.

02:19.134 --> 02:21.068
I'll talk to Hank.

02:21.103 --> 02:22.804
You just back me up
with everyone else.

02:22.838 --> 02:24.106
You really expect me to say

02:24.140 --> 02:26.441
"Okay, Walt, sure,
just stay here and..."

02:28.211 --> 02:31.646
No, there's got to be
another way.

02:32.782 --> 02:33.948
There isn't.

02:34.984 --> 02:36.651
There was,

02:36.686 --> 02:38.686
but now there isn't.

02:41.757 --> 02:43.891
Walt,

02:43.926 --> 02:46.193
how long till you're safe,

02:46.228 --> 02:47.628
till you can work this out?

02:51.868 --> 02:53.101
Oh, Skyler...

02:56.139 --> 02:57.640
- Skyler--
-

02:57.675 --> 03:02.345
I have lived under the threat
of death for a year now,

03:02.380 --> 03:05.549
and because of that,

03:05.583 --> 03:06.683
I've made choices.

03:06.718 --> 03:09.120
- Walt--
- Listen to me.

03:09.154 --> 03:12.490
I alone should suffer
the consequences

03:12.525 --> 03:14.492
of those choices, no one else.

03:15.494 --> 03:16.961
And those consequences--

03:18.630 --> 03:20.464
they're coming.

03:23.602 --> 03:25.970
No more prolonging
the inevitable.

03:35.848 --> 03:37.716
Feed that belt-- yep, right
through those seatbelt holders

03:37.750 --> 03:39.151
- Thank you so much.
- Hank,

03:39.185 --> 03:40.686
I've got a car wash to run.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.421
I mean,
you don't honestly believe

03:42.456 --> 03:44.790
that I'm in danger,
do you? Me?

03:44.825 --> 03:46.392
<i>Oh, Jesus,</i>

03:46.426 --> 03:48.227
everything's going to go
over like a lead balloon.

03:48.262 --> 03:49.629
It'll be Marie who kills me.

03:49.664 --> 03:50.997
<i>All right, well,</i> <i>just know</i>

03:51.032 --> 03:53.467
that I'll get there
as soon as I can,

03:53.501 --> 03:55.736
and let Steve Gomez know.

03:55.770 --> 03:58.839
I told some of his guys,
and just stay safe.

03:58.873 --> 04:00.107
<i>Oh, please.</i>

04:00.141 --> 04:02.110
Whole thing's
just a giant jerk-off.

04:02.144 --> 04:06.815
Yeah, yeah, but keep your head
down anyway, all right?

04:06.849 --> 04:08.450
<i>All right.</i>

04:08.484 --> 04:10.819
All right, buddy, take care.

04:16.093 --> 04:18.861
Shh, shh, shh, shh...

04:20.932 --> 04:21.964
I know.

04:28.006 --> 04:29.239
Shh, shh, shh...

04:47.557 --> 04:49.224
Okay, my love. We're okay.

04:54.163 --> 04:55.764
Okay, my darling.
It's okay.

04:56.933 --> 04:59.969
Okay...

07:22.949 --> 07:26.819
He's going to risk
his life over a stupid car wash?

07:26.853 --> 07:28.587
Does he even understand

07:28.621 --> 07:29.721
what's going on
with Uncle Hank?

07:29.756 --> 07:31.423
He'll come when he's able.

07:31.458 --> 07:32.858
That's pathetic.

07:32.892 --> 07:36.928
How hard did you even try,
or did you?

07:36.963 --> 07:39.664
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Lay off your mom.

07:39.699 --> 07:41.099
Well, you know, Hank, we wouldn't
even be arguing about this

07:41.133 --> 07:44.803
if you and Steve
would just make him come.

07:44.837 --> 07:46.238
Why didn't your people
put him in the car?

07:46.272 --> 07:48.339
Uh, because it's not
Nazi German, all right?

07:48.374 --> 07:50.174
Oh, pl-- you--
Nazi Germany.

07:50.208 --> 07:52.376
If I had a dollar
for every time I heard that.

07:52.411 --> 07:54.245
You know what?
I'm going to call him.

07:54.279 --> 07:57.080
He's going to get
his behind here immediately.

07:57.115 --> 07:58.682
End of story.

07:58.716 --> 08:01.184
Thank you. At least somebody
is listening to me.

08:01.218 --> 08:03.286
Because we are all
in danger here.

08:03.320 --> 08:04.721
We are not all in danger.

08:04.755 --> 08:06.122
Will you stop saying that?

08:06.156 --> 08:08.925
That is asking for trouble.

08:08.959 --> 08:11.127
Oh, come on, Walt.

08:16.467 --> 08:18.134
He's not picking up.

08:18.168 --> 08:19.835
Look, could we just take
this down a notch?

08:19.869 --> 08:21.403
Okay, everybody?

08:21.438 --> 08:24.072
Sky, you guys can stay here
as long as you like, okay?

08:24.107 --> 08:25.274
We've got plenty of room.

08:25.308 --> 08:26.408
But I wouldn't worry

08:26.442 --> 08:28.410
about any danger to Walt
or any of us.

08:28.444 --> 08:30.179
Okay?

08:30.213 --> 08:33.215
This whole thing's
just a damn smoke screen.

08:33.250 --> 08:35.083
How do you mean
a-- a smoke screen?

08:35.119 --> 08:37.020
An anonymous threat against me?

08:37.054 --> 08:39.957
I'm stuck in a wheelchair.
I'm not even on the job.

08:39.991 --> 08:43.995
No, someone doesn't like the way
I've been spending my free time.

08:44.029 --> 08:45.997
What, minerals?

08:49.568 --> 08:51.970
Timing seem a bit odd
to you, huh?

08:52.004 --> 08:53.705
I mean, I start looking
into, you know...

08:56.275 --> 08:57.742
Fring, and all of a sudden
I'm under lockdown for my own protection?

08:57.776 --> 08:59.710
Wait a minute.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What?

08:59.744 --> 09:01.244
Gus Fring?

09:01.279 --> 09:02.646
From the chicken restaurant?

09:02.680 --> 09:04.414
Hank, what are
you talking about?

09:06.417 --> 09:08.151
Just one man's humble opinion.

09:08.185 --> 09:09.419
That's all,

09:09.453 --> 09:11.354
but I think Los Pollos Hermanos

09:11.388 --> 09:13.357
is a front for the biggest
meth distributor

09:13.391 --> 09:14.391
in the Southwest.

09:14.426 --> 09:16.427
- Oh, my God.
- Steve...

09:16.461 --> 09:19.030
- Oh, my God.
Are you-- Are you even looking into this?

09:19.064 --> 09:20.264
We're looking into everything,

09:20.299 --> 09:22.600
but we work on fact,
not conjecture,

09:22.635 --> 09:24.035
and the fact is

09:24.070 --> 09:25.871
that the scumbags
that hit you first

09:25.905 --> 09:27.139
were Mexican cartel,

09:27.173 --> 09:30.242
not some German multinational
whatever,

09:30.276 --> 09:32.310
and definitely
not Colonel Sanders.

09:32.345 --> 09:34.646
Now, if we even had
a shred of proof--

09:34.680 --> 09:36.881
Isn't that what you
get paid to go get?

09:38.217 --> 09:40.151
Remember that laundry
I told you about?

09:40.186 --> 09:41.953
I'd start there.

09:41.987 --> 09:43.354
Come on, man.

09:43.388 --> 09:45.389
It's a perfect spot
for a meth superlab.

09:45.423 --> 09:46.557
Oh, my God.

09:46.591 --> 09:49.092
Hey,

09:49.127 --> 09:51.361
what if I'm right?

09:51.395 --> 09:52.762
Even if you were right--

09:52.797 --> 09:54.397
and you ain't--

09:54.432 --> 09:56.332
but if you were,
there's no way in hell

09:56.367 --> 09:57.734
a judge is going to give me
a search warrant--

09:57.768 --> 09:58.969
Search warrant?

09:59.003 --> 10:01.405
What happened to good,
old-fashioned knock and talk?

10:01.439 --> 10:03.907
Oh, that's right. I forgot.

10:03.941 --> 10:06.310
You were never very good
at those, were you?

10:38.545 --> 10:40.346
- Can I help you?
- Yes, sir.

10:40.380 --> 10:43.216
My friend and I-- we wondered
if we could take a look around.

10:43.250 --> 10:44.551
Why?

10:44.585 --> 10:46.620
- Sorry, what's your name?
- Dennis.

10:46.654 --> 10:47.921
Dennis. Hey, I'm Steve Gomez.

10:47.955 --> 10:50.624
I'm with the DEA,
Drug Enforcement.

10:50.658 --> 10:52.091
What, is there--
there a problem?

10:52.126 --> 10:53.759
Not for you.
No, no problem.

10:53.794 --> 10:55.094
We're just wondering if we
could take a look around.

10:55.128 --> 10:56.128
I, uh--

10:57.864 --> 10:58.997
Can I tell you a story?

10:59.999 --> 11:01.667
- Yeah.
- I bust this chef.

11:01.701 --> 11:02.968
Well, he says he's a chef,

11:03.002 --> 11:04.503
but just because you work
at a restaurant

11:04.537 --> 11:06.538
that charges $14 for a burger,

11:06.572 --> 11:08.073
that don't make you a chef.

11:08.107 --> 11:10.542
That makes you
a glorified burger flipper,

11:10.576 --> 11:11.743
at least in my book.

11:11.777 --> 11:13.145
- Yeah.
- Anyway,

11:13.179 --> 11:15.514
so we bust this chef--
heroin possession.

11:15.549 --> 11:17.416
He says, "Well, just
because you found heroin

11:17.451 --> 11:20.187
"in my chef whites
doesn't make it mine."

11:20.221 --> 11:21.655
Maybe it came from the place

11:21.689 --> 11:24.158
that launders my chef
whites"-- this place.

11:24.192 --> 11:26.193
Oh, come on, man. I don't want
to do this stuff with you.

11:26.228 --> 11:27.629
I-I know, I know.

11:27.663 --> 11:29.464
You don't have to say it.
I'll say it for you.

11:29.498 --> 11:32.467
His story is a big load
of steaming horse shit.

11:32.501 --> 11:34.602
I mean, we're going to
find heroin here

11:34.636 --> 11:37.538
like we're going to find
Jimmy Hoffa. Right?

11:37.573 --> 11:40.007
The thing is,
is that the chef's daddy

11:40.042 --> 11:42.243
is a United States Senator.

11:42.277 --> 11:43.777
I'm not going to tell you
which one,

11:43.812 --> 11:45.479
but you probably know
who he is, right?

11:45.513 --> 11:47.581
So now I've got to waste
my time

11:47.615 --> 11:50.050
checking out
this burger flipper's story,

11:50.084 --> 11:52.419
and if I don't, his old man's
going to jam me up,

11:52.453 --> 11:55.323
my ASAC,
my whole entire office.

11:55.357 --> 11:57.125
Politics, huh?

11:57.159 --> 11:58.393
So what do you think?

11:58.427 --> 12:00.295
Listen, you know what?

12:00.329 --> 12:02.030
I have to check with my boss,
and he's out of town,

12:02.065 --> 12:04.634
and I can't promise I'll reach him
anytime soon either, you know?

12:04.668 --> 12:06.802
Well, yeah, that's probably
the way to go,

12:06.837 --> 12:08.437
so I'll have to go get
a warrant,

12:08.472 --> 12:10.106
and we'll do it official,

12:10.140 --> 12:12.042
but you're probably going to
have to close down for the day.

12:12.076 --> 12:13.176
What--? Why?

12:13.210 --> 12:15.111
Twenty agents poking around?

12:15.145 --> 12:16.513
Come on, it'll be less trouble

12:16.547 --> 12:17.714
if it was just us two,

12:17.749 --> 12:19.883
but your call.

12:24.523 --> 12:26.691
Just the two of you?

12:26.726 --> 12:28.059
You'll make it quick, right?

12:28.094 --> 12:30.895
Dennis, we'll be like the wind.

12:31.998 --> 12:33.164
O-Okay.

12:33.199 --> 12:35.367
- Could you tell him?
- Okay.

12:35.401 --> 12:37.035
Okay.

12:45.545 --> 12:48.180
Oh, and, Dennis, can you clear
out some of your people for us?

12:48.214 --> 12:49.715
Confuses the dog's nose.

13:59.319 --> 14:03.223
So how long we
gotta be quiet down here?

14:07.561 --> 14:10.930
Then what happens after this,

14:10.964 --> 14:14.700
provided they don't find their
way in here and bust our asses?

14:14.735 --> 14:16.769
I'm gonna be, like, stuck
down here in a laundry hamper

14:16.803 --> 14:19.605
for the rest of eternity?

14:19.639 --> 14:22.174
No, I'm going on record.

14:22.209 --> 14:23.976
This-- This blows.

14:28.883 --> 14:30.383
Hello.

14:34.955 --> 14:36.522
For you.

14:44.464 --> 14:46.399
Yeah?

14:46.433 --> 14:49.001
<i>Do you know
what's</i> <i>happening upstairs?</i>

14:49.035 --> 14:51.204
I have a pretty good idea.

14:51.238 --> 14:55.108
This is all the result
of your former partner.

14:55.143 --> 14:57.344
Do you understand now?

14:57.378 --> 15:00.013
<i>Do you see</i>
<i>why this can't continue?</i>

15:01.782 --> 15:02.916
You know, I get it.

15:02.950 --> 15:04.718
The guy's a complete
and total dick,

15:04.752 --> 15:06.786
but I can't--

15:09.223 --> 15:11.224
I'm not signing off.

15:11.258 --> 15:14.227
<i>Okay?</i>

15:14.261 --> 15:16.629
Like I said,

15:16.664 --> 15:20.900
if something final

15:20.934 --> 15:24.437
happens to Mr. White,

15:24.472 --> 15:26.106
we are going to have a problem.

15:31.546 --> 15:32.947
<i>So what are you going to do?</i>

15:37.319 --> 15:39.521
There will be
an appropriate response.

15:39.555 --> 15:41.824
<i>Appropriate, what does that mean?</i>

15:41.858 --> 15:43.092
Hello?

16:20.493 --> 16:21.927
They're gone.

16:23.129 --> 16:24.630
We're good.

17:37.936 --> 17:39.170
<i>You have reached</i> <i>Walter White.</i>

17:39.204 --> 17:40.704
<i>At the tone,</i>
<i>please state your name,</i>

17:40.738 --> 17:42.439
<i>number, and the reason</i>
<i>for your call.</i>

17:42.474 --> 17:43.540
<i>Thank you.</i>

18:06.064 --> 18:09.366
<i>You have six new messages.</i>

18:09.401 --> 18:10.868
<i>Hey, kid, it's me, Goodman.</i>

18:10.902 --> 18:12.436
<i>Give me a call, would you?</i>

18:15.606 --> 18:17.674
<i>Hey, need to hear from you.
</i> <i>All right?</i>

18:17.708 --> 18:19.375
<i>Hope I made myself clear</i>
<i>about that.</i>

18:19.410 --> 18:22.145
<i>Call me as soon as you can.</i>

18:24.047 --> 18:26.215
<i>Pinkman, get over here.</i>
<i>Stat, pronto.</i>

18:26.250 --> 18:27.751
<i>Don't call.</i>
<i>Just get over here.</i>

18:27.785 --> 18:28.818
<i>Would you just...?</i>
<i>Please.</i>

18:30.388 --> 18:32.756
<i>I don't know if I'm</i>
<i>speaking English here--</i>

18:35.793 --> 18:37.894
What's up?
He's waiting for me, yo.

18:37.928 --> 18:39.862
Hold up, hold up.

18:39.897 --> 18:41.230
The hell, man?

18:41.265 --> 18:42.432
Get off of me!

18:42.466 --> 18:44.333
Hey, Goodman!
Get out here!

18:44.367 --> 18:45.801
Get-- [Saul] Hey!

18:45.835 --> 18:47.269
Yo, get your goon off me.

18:47.303 --> 18:49.538
Not him, moron. Drop.
Leave it. Go lie down.

18:49.572 --> 18:51.973
Sorry, you can't
be too careful these days.

18:52.007 --> 18:54.743
Come on, come on.
Lock the door, frisky.

18:54.777 --> 18:55.777
Jesus.

18:59.615 --> 19:01.616
Take a break, H.T. Let's go.

19:01.651 --> 19:02.884
You're going to stop
calling me that,

19:02.919 --> 19:04.620
or I'm going to hang you
by your tie.

19:04.654 --> 19:07.090
Yeah, yeah, stop showing off
for the client.

19:07.124 --> 19:09.425
Honey Tits.
I say it's endearing.

19:11.228 --> 19:14.097
So what's so important?

19:14.131 --> 19:15.332
Well, they're here--

19:15.366 --> 19:16.733
the end times, kid.

19:16.767 --> 19:18.134
End times.

19:18.169 --> 19:19.569
What's that mean?

19:19.603 --> 19:21.070
And why the hell you drag
me down here for?

19:21.105 --> 19:22.905
You want your money, don't you?

19:22.939 --> 19:24.740
I assume that you do.

19:24.774 --> 19:26.308
What, that couldn't wait?

19:26.342 --> 19:28.776
You ever hear the expression
"a fart in the wind," kid?

19:28.811 --> 19:30.911
Well, inside of an hour,
that's going to be me, okay?

19:30.946 --> 19:33.214
I'm hitting the road.
I'm gone. I'm out of here.

19:33.248 --> 19:35.383
What, for, like, good?

19:35.417 --> 19:36.818
For as long as it takes.

19:36.853 --> 19:39.421
I don't like my heat so hot,
if you catch my drift.

19:39.456 --> 19:41.891
I'm not catching, like,
anything you're saying,

19:41.925 --> 19:43.159
and what the hell
is your problem?

19:43.193 --> 19:45.094
You haven't talked
to your partner, have you?

19:45.129 --> 19:46.897
No, not since last night.

19:46.931 --> 19:48.766
Today he didn't show up
to work,

19:48.800 --> 19:51.168
and the DEA just happened
to, like, raid us.

19:51.203 --> 19:55.373
Yeah, some coincidence, huh?

19:55.407 --> 19:56.874
Yeah, I don't know about that.

19:56.909 --> 19:59.177
All I know is when he tells me

19:59.211 --> 20:01.113
that your employer
took him out in the desert

20:01.147 --> 20:02.714
and threatened to murder
his entire family,

20:02.749 --> 20:03.982
I sit up and take notice

20:04.017 --> 20:06.518
because, hey, after all,
what am I if not family?

20:06.553 --> 20:08.253
What are you--
What are you talking about?

20:08.288 --> 20:09.588
When did that happen?

20:11.291 --> 20:12.991
I don't know. Forget it.

20:13.026 --> 20:15.494
He-- He exaggerates, right?
He does that.

20:15.528 --> 20:17.496
Hey, listen, do me a favor.

20:17.530 --> 20:19.632
Would you put in a good word
for me with Fring?

20:19.666 --> 20:23.069
I mean,
just for old time's sake.

20:23.103 --> 20:25.939
I can't afford to butter
the wrong bread here.

20:28.076 --> 20:29.710
Yeah.

20:58.206 --> 20:59.473
Hey.

20:59.507 --> 21:00.942
Hey.

21:03.611 --> 21:05.045
Nothing, huh?

21:05.079 --> 21:06.513
Clean as a whistle,

21:06.547 --> 21:08.415
so he says.

21:26.999 --> 21:28.232
<i>You have reached</i> <i>Walter White.</i>

21:28.267 --> 21:29.767
<i>At the tone,</i>
<i>please state your name,</i>

21:29.802 --> 21:31.502
<i>number, and the reason</i>
<i>for your call.</i>

21:31.537 --> 21:32.603
<i>Thank you.</i>

21:34.373 --> 21:36.641
It's me again.

21:36.676 --> 21:38.143
I really wish you'd pick up.

21:42.249 --> 21:44.918
God, I just--

21:46.254 --> 21:48.255
Call me back, okay?

21:48.289 --> 21:51.859
Just-- Just call me back,
please.

22:09.510 --> 22:13.279
Hi, I'm sorry. Is it okay if I
come out here for a few minutes?

22:15.081 --> 22:17.049
Yeah, sure, just stay
up here, if you would.

22:28.095 --> 22:33.399
Excuse me, I wonder if you
have a-- an extra cigarette?

22:33.434 --> 22:36.202
I sure could use a smoke
right about now.

22:36.236 --> 22:37.937
Sure.

22:41.108 --> 22:42.942
Thank you.

22:48.683 --> 22:50.383
Thanks.

23:27.858 --> 23:29.558
Hey, what's up?

23:32.296 --> 23:33.663
What?

23:33.697 --> 23:35.964
Hey-- Hey--

23:37.500 --> 23:39.001
What's wrong with him?

23:41.237 --> 23:42.604
What hospital?

23:47.375 --> 23:48.409
Andrea.

23:48.443 --> 23:50.544
Jesse.

23:50.579 --> 23:52.045
Where's Brock?
They've got him inside.

23:52.080 --> 23:53.180
Grandma's with him.

23:53.214 --> 23:55.682
They got me filling out
all this paperwork--

23:55.717 --> 23:57.551
How's he doing?
Tell me what's going on?

23:57.585 --> 24:01.155
The doctors-- they don't
know what it is exactly.

24:01.189 --> 24:03.958
It's like-- It's like
he's got the flu,

24:03.992 --> 24:06.660
but-- but he just keeps
getting worse.

24:06.695 --> 24:07.928
Oh...

24:09.965 --> 24:13.802
Jess, I don't understand.

24:13.837 --> 24:15.604
He was fine this morning.

24:15.638 --> 24:19.741
He was fine.

24:22.846 --> 24:24.847
- Andrea Cantillo?
- Right here.

24:24.881 --> 24:26.815
Ms. Cantillo,
we're going to go ahead

24:26.850 --> 24:29.318
and admit your son
to the pediatric ICU.

24:29.353 --> 24:31.554
- You can bring that with you.
- Okay.

24:31.588 --> 24:33.022
So you're the boy's father?

24:33.057 --> 24:35.559
- No.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

24:35.593 --> 24:37.962
It's just we try to keep it to
two visitors maximum, so-- okay?

24:37.996 --> 24:39.796
No, go, go.
I'll be out here if you need me.

24:39.831 --> 24:41.065
Go, go ahead.

25:09.994 --> 25:11.661
No.

25:11.696 --> 25:14.064
No, no.

25:14.098 --> 25:16.466
No. No.

25:16.501 --> 25:18.502
No... no...

25:20.305 --> 25:21.773
Come on.

25:22.842 --> 25:24.943
No!

25:24.977 --> 25:26.411
No, No.

25:36.957 --> 25:39.325
Andrea!

25:39.360 --> 25:40.360
Andr--

25:40.394 --> 25:41.761
Hey, hey, hey, no yelling.

25:41.795 --> 25:43.395
- Andrea-- I need--
- We can't have you back here.

25:43.430 --> 25:44.797
No, I need to talk to her.
All right? I need to talk to her.

25:44.831 --> 25:45.964
You two,
just take this outside.

25:45.999 --> 25:47.432
Would you please--

25:47.467 --> 25:48.700
Brock is sick in here.

25:48.734 --> 25:50.101
Come here--
Here.

25:50.135 --> 25:51.369
Jesse...

25:51.403 --> 25:53.971
Jesse, what is it?

25:55.040 --> 25:56.306
Jesse, I can't go.

25:56.341 --> 25:57.440
Brock stays in here.

25:57.475 --> 25:58.508
- Okay.
- What--

25:58.542 --> 26:00.676
I'm-- I'm thinking Brock

26:00.711 --> 26:01.978
may have been poisoned.
Okay?

26:02.012 --> 26:03.713
What?

26:03.747 --> 26:07.350
There's this stuff,
this stuff called ricin.

26:07.384 --> 26:08.484
It sounds like "rice."

26:08.519 --> 26:10.586
You need to tell
the doctors about it.

26:10.621 --> 26:12.355
Why would you say that?
How do you know?

26:12.389 --> 26:15.125
It doesn't matter.
Just tell them it's a guess.

26:15.160 --> 26:16.460
Okay? Ricin.

26:16.494 --> 26:18.429
They'll know
what you're talking about.

26:18.463 --> 26:20.597
Jesse, if there's something
you're not saying,

26:20.632 --> 26:22.199
you've got to tell me--

26:22.233 --> 26:24.368
Look, I gotta go.
I gotta go see some one.

26:24.402 --> 26:25.569
- Jesse.
- Look, I'm sorry.

26:25.604 --> 26:27.571
I'm sorr-- I gotta go.
Just tell them.

26:27.606 --> 26:29.206
Okay? Now! Just do it!

26:33.545 --> 26:36.347
Hello? Can you buzz me in,
please?

26:36.381 --> 26:37.815
Buzz me in!

27:07.012 --> 27:09.047
What do you want?

27:09.081 --> 27:10.415
We need to talk.

27:12.518 --> 27:13.551
Who's with you?

27:13.586 --> 27:16.021
No one, just me.
Let me in.

27:32.070 --> 27:33.671
I don't know what you're
thinking coming here.

27:36.407 --> 27:38.508
Oh, Christ.

27:38.542 --> 27:40.443
What does it matter?

27:40.478 --> 27:44.448
Everything, it's all--
all coming to an end.

27:44.482 --> 27:47.184
Do you even know
what's happening,

27:47.218 --> 27:49.419
the full scope
of what's happening?

27:50.488 --> 27:52.022
They took me out
into the desert.

27:52.057 --> 27:54.591
They put a hood over my head

27:54.625 --> 27:56.159
and drove me out
into the desert,

27:56.193 --> 27:57.227
on my knees.

27:57.262 --> 27:59.163
They threatened my family,

27:59.197 --> 28:00.598
and not just Hank.

28:02.834 --> 28:05.936
My wife, my children...

28:11.276 --> 28:13.144
It's just a matter of time now.

28:15.380 --> 28:19.851
I was-- I was able
to protect them for now,

28:19.885 --> 28:21.052
but...

28:24.223 --> 28:26.191
Gus is going to make
his move...

28:39.474 --> 28:44.010
and I don't--
I don't know when.

28:44.044 --> 28:47.113
I don't know where or how.

28:49.750 --> 28:51.584
All I know is
it's going to happen.

28:58.525 --> 29:00.393
And I'm powerless to stop him.

29:06.334 --> 29:07.835
What are you doing?

29:10.339 --> 29:12.373
Why did you do it?

29:12.408 --> 29:13.542
Why?

29:13.576 --> 29:16.979
Jesse, Gus gave me no choice.

29:17.013 --> 29:18.814
I had to call the DEA

29:18.849 --> 29:20.049
to protect my family.

29:20.083 --> 29:21.150
What else could I do?

29:21.184 --> 29:23.052
No. No, you son of a bitch.

29:23.086 --> 29:24.319
You know what you did.

29:24.354 --> 29:26.454
Okay, look, just--

29:26.489 --> 29:27.722
just put the gun down.

29:27.756 --> 29:29.891
Okay? Just put it down,
and we'll talk.

29:29.925 --> 29:31.158
All right?

29:31.193 --> 29:34.328
You tell me-- tell me what
it is you think I did.

29:34.362 --> 29:37.097
Brock--
why did you poison him?

29:37.131 --> 29:38.732
Who's Brock?

29:38.766 --> 29:40.433
You saw him in my living room
just last night.

29:40.468 --> 29:42.769
You came to my door,
and you looked right at him,

29:42.804 --> 29:44.805
so don't tell me
you don't know him.

29:44.840 --> 29:46.574
The boy.

29:46.608 --> 29:50.311
Jesse, I have no idea
who these people are.

29:50.346 --> 29:53.648
Now, please--
Okay, that's Brock,

29:53.683 --> 29:55.250
and-- and he was poisoned?

29:55.285 --> 30:00.789
The ricin! He's dying because
someone gave it to him,

30:00.823 --> 30:02.558
and only you and I

30:02.592 --> 30:04.359
were the only two people
on earth

30:04.394 --> 30:06.027
who knew about it.

30:06.062 --> 30:07.595
Now wait a minute.

30:07.630 --> 30:08.829
Wait a minute.

30:08.864 --> 30:10.097
Maybe he went into
your pockets and accid--

30:10.132 --> 30:11.199
No!

30:11.233 --> 30:12.933
I had it.

30:12.967 --> 30:15.235
I had the cigarette
with the ricin in my pack

30:15.269 --> 30:16.570
this morning.

30:16.604 --> 30:19.372
The last time I saw Brock
was last night,

30:19.406 --> 30:20.640
and this morning

30:20.674 --> 30:22.576
I switched the cigarette
into a new pack.

30:22.610 --> 30:24.811
There's no way
Brock took it himself.

30:24.846 --> 30:27.248
Jesse, you're not thinking
clearly.

30:27.282 --> 30:28.883
Listen, you said it yourself

30:28.917 --> 30:30.318
that you had it this morning.

30:30.352 --> 30:32.721
Then when could I have
possibly gotten it?

30:32.755 --> 30:35.223
You-- You had Saul do it.

30:35.258 --> 30:36.858
- What?
- Yeah.

30:36.893 --> 30:39.027
Yeah, I went to his office.

30:39.062 --> 30:40.962
He called me and just had
to see me today.

30:40.997 --> 30:43.231
His big man-mountain bodyguard
patted me down.

30:43.265 --> 30:46.466
That's when he must've stolen
it off of me, right?

30:46.501 --> 30:48.302
That's the plan?
Was that the plan?

30:51.139 --> 30:54.942
Jesse, why?

30:54.976 --> 30:58.579
Why, in God's name,

30:58.613 --> 31:00.313
would I poison a child?

31:00.347 --> 31:01.781
To get back at me.

31:03.551 --> 31:05.452
Because I'm helping Gus,

31:05.486 --> 31:07.120
and this is your way

31:07.155 --> 31:08.588
of ripping my heart out

31:08.623 --> 31:10.557
before you're dead and gone.

31:10.592 --> 31:12.526
Just admit it.

31:12.560 --> 31:14.861
Admit what you did.

31:14.896 --> 31:15.962
Admit it!

31:15.996 --> 31:17.163
I did not do this!

31:17.198 --> 31:18.865
Shut up!

31:18.900 --> 31:21.267
Stop lying!

31:21.302 --> 31:22.669
I'm not-- I'm not lying.

31:22.703 --> 31:24.304
I'm not lying.
Just listen to me.

31:24.339 --> 31:27.074
Listen to me.
What would I have to gain?

31:27.108 --> 31:30.711
What possible,
possible could--

31:30.746 --> 31:32.213
Who-- Who would--

31:35.685 --> 31:37.086
Oh, my God.

31:41.124 --> 31:42.557
Hey.

31:45.695 --> 31:46.894
Stop laughing.

31:47.896 --> 31:49.697
Stop laughing!

31:55.169 --> 31:56.769
I have been waiting.

31:58.205 --> 32:01.140
I have been waiting all day,

32:01.175 --> 32:03.143
waiting for Gus to send

32:03.177 --> 32:05.078
one of his men to kill me...

32:07.781 --> 32:09.548
and it's you.

32:13.320 --> 32:15.054
Who do you know

32:15.088 --> 32:18.124
who's okay with using
children, Jesse?

32:18.158 --> 32:22.094
Who do you know who has allowed
children to be murdered?

32:22.128 --> 32:25.030
Hm? Gus!

32:25.064 --> 32:29.300
He has-- He has been 10 steps
ahead of me at every turn,

32:29.335 --> 32:31.269
and now the one thing

32:31.303 --> 32:32.403
that he needed

32:32.438 --> 32:34.172
to finally get rid of me
is your consent,

32:34.206 --> 32:35.340
and, boy, he's got that now.

32:35.374 --> 32:36.541
He's got it.

32:36.576 --> 32:39.377
And not only does he have that,

32:39.412 --> 32:41.146
but he manipulated you

32:41.181 --> 32:42.682
into pulling the trigger
for him.

32:42.716 --> 32:45.619
Only you and I knew
about the ricin!

32:45.653 --> 32:47.921
No! You don't even
believe that

32:47.956 --> 32:50.224
with Gus' cameras everywhere.

32:50.259 --> 32:52.928
Please. Listen to yourself.

32:52.962 --> 32:55.631
No, he has known everything
all along.

32:55.665 --> 32:57.700
Where were you today?
In the lab?

32:57.734 --> 32:59.368
And you don't think
it's possible

32:59.402 --> 33:02.637
that Tyrus lifted the cigarette
out of your locker?

33:02.672 --> 33:05.240
Come on.

33:05.274 --> 33:07.141
Don't you see?

33:07.176 --> 33:09.877
You are the last piece
of the puzzle.

33:09.911 --> 33:12.112
You are everything
that he's wanted.

33:12.146 --> 33:14.214
You're his cook now.

33:14.248 --> 33:15.949
You're the cook,
and you have proven

33:15.983 --> 33:18.751
that you can run a lab
without me,

33:18.786 --> 33:21.754
and now that cook
has reason to kill me.

33:23.124 --> 33:24.692
Think about it!

33:24.726 --> 33:26.827
It's brilliant.

33:28.130 --> 33:29.330
So go ahead.

33:30.833 --> 33:32.467
Go ahead.

33:32.502 --> 33:37.106
If you think that I am capable
of doing this, then go ahead.

33:37.140 --> 33:40.309
Put a bullet in my head

33:40.344 --> 33:42.145
and kill me right now.

33:44.982 --> 33:46.482
Do it!

33:47.618 --> 33:49.185
Do it.

33:49.220 --> 33:50.453
I'll do it.

33:50.488 --> 33:51.821
Do it.

33:53.824 --> 33:55.158
Do it.

34:24.856 --> 34:26.056
Where are you going?

34:26.090 --> 34:27.257
I'm going to find
the son of a bitch,

34:27.291 --> 34:28.358
and I'm going to kill him.

34:28.391 --> 34:31.094
No, don't.

34:31.128 --> 34:32.929
He'll see you coming.

34:37.302 --> 34:40.304
You'll die before you get
anywhere near him.

34:40.338 --> 34:41.572
I don't care.

34:41.606 --> 34:46.243
Jesse. Jesse,
just get in your car.

34:46.277 --> 34:47.878
Just go.

34:47.911 --> 34:50.280
Just drive.

34:50.315 --> 34:55.118
No, I'm going to do this
one way or another, Mr. White.

34:58.389 --> 34:59.856
Then let me help.

35:28.990 --> 35:31.859
Oh, Jesus, Mr. Pinkman,

35:31.893 --> 35:33.694
I'm not going to keep
telling you.

35:33.728 --> 35:35.428
Unless the family wants you
in there,

35:35.463 --> 35:36.763
you're not allowed.

35:37.965 --> 35:41.000
You can't keep coming
in here like this.

35:41.034 --> 35:44.536
You hear me?
You understand?

35:44.571 --> 35:47.138
Mr. Pinkman,
I'm going to call Security.

35:50.276 --> 35:51.643
All right, here we go.

35:55.648 --> 35:58.050
Come on now.

35:58.084 --> 35:59.718
Mr. Pinkman,
final warning.

36:30.753 --> 36:32.454
Hey.

36:34.624 --> 36:38.127
You need to be at work now.

36:38.161 --> 36:40.229
I already told you.
I'm not going.

36:44.468 --> 36:46.368
You've got a batch
that will be ruined

36:46.402 --> 36:49.338
and an employer
who will be very upset

36:49.372 --> 36:50.605
if that happens.

36:50.640 --> 36:53.041
And I could give a shit.

36:54.276 --> 36:55.977
I'm not leaving here.

36:56.012 --> 36:58.880
If my employer
has a problem with that,

36:58.915 --> 37:00.882
he can tell me himself,

37:00.916 --> 37:02.884
not his errand boy.

37:07.657 --> 37:09.124
Get--

37:10.993 --> 37:12.661
Hey, I don't know this guy!

37:12.695 --> 37:13.962
Call Security!

37:13.996 --> 37:16.364
I'm being attacked!

37:21.938 --> 37:24.639
Yeah, that's right.

37:40.189 --> 37:41.923
We've got a situation.

39:39.176 --> 39:41.711
He'd like to speak with you.

39:41.746 --> 39:44.581
I told you, I'm not leaving.

39:44.616 --> 39:46.684
He's downstairs.

40:01.900 --> 40:04.201
Tyrus told me
what's happening--

40:05.536 --> 40:06.969
the sick child.

40:08.605 --> 40:10.907
I understand
your preoccupation,

40:10.941 --> 40:13.376
but, Jesse,
I am running a business.

40:15.646 --> 40:18.247
I need you back at the lab
to complete the cook.

40:18.282 --> 40:21.050
You can return
when you're done.

40:23.520 --> 40:25.988
I can't.

40:26.022 --> 40:27.856
It is, as you must know,

40:27.890 --> 40:29.724
in both of our best interests.

40:32.661 --> 40:34.229
That little boy upstairs

40:34.263 --> 40:35.897
is dying.

40:37.833 --> 40:41.602
I can't be away.
I don't even want to be here now.

40:41.636 --> 40:44.672
I can't be away if
something happens, if he--

40:44.706 --> 40:46.941
I am very sorry.

40:48.644 --> 40:50.411
Is there anything I can do?

40:50.446 --> 40:53.015
I am on the board
of this hospital.

40:53.049 --> 40:55.651
I can recommend doctors,

40:55.685 --> 40:58.655
make sure he gets
whatever he needs,

40:58.689 --> 41:00.223
the best treatment.

41:02.494 --> 41:03.995
He's not sick.

41:05.964 --> 41:08.032
He was poisoned.

41:11.402 --> 41:12.869
How did that happen?

41:15.373 --> 41:16.707
The doctors--

41:18.443 --> 41:19.777
they don't know.

41:31.925 --> 41:34.293
This current batch...

41:35.362 --> 41:38.532
is surely ruined now.

41:38.566 --> 41:39.933
Correct?

41:54.281 --> 41:55.881
Stay with the boy.

41:57.984 --> 42:01.654
Tyrus will dump what's there
and clean the tanks.

42:01.688 --> 42:04.724
You will start a new batch

42:04.758 --> 42:06.425
when you are ready to return...

42:10.831 --> 42:12.031
next week.

42:43.564 --> 42:45.264
There you are.

42:47.268 --> 42:48.702
There you are.

43:08.389 --> 43:09.823
Keep going.

43:31.077 --> 43:32.077
Why'd you stop?

43:33.080 --> 43:34.280
Why did you stop?

43:42.756 --> 43:44.423
Why did you stop?

43:49.463 --> 43:51.731
Come on.
Come on.

44:34.105 --> 44:35.472
Come on, come on.

44:35.506 --> 44:39.310
Please. Oh, God, please.

44:39.344 --> 44:40.945
Please.

45:04.400 --> 45:05.800
No, no, no. No, don't go.

45:05.834 --> 45:07.269
Don't go, don't go, don't go.

45:07.303 --> 45:09.605
No. No.

45:11.841 --> 45:13.576
Oh, sh...

45:16.179 --> 45:17.880
No.
