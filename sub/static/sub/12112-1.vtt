00:53.594 --> 00:59.566
SPAIN IS THE MOST POWERFUL EMPIRE
IN THE WORLD

01:06.106 --> 01:11.942
PHILIP OF SPAIN, A DEVOUT CATHOLIC

01:13.380 --> 01:19.319
HAS PLUNGED EUROPE INTO HOLY WAR

01:19.887 --> 01:25.856
ONLY ENGLAND STANDS AGAINST HIM

01:29.863 --> 01:34.664
RULED BY A PROTESTANT QUEEN

02:21.471 --> 02:23.520
Come, my daughter.

02:24.735 --> 02:26.691
Isabella

02:28.082 --> 02:31.532
God has spoken to me.

02:31.533 --> 02:35.435
The time for our great
enterprise has come.

02:36.354 --> 02:40.800
England is enslaved to the devil.

02:40.888 --> 02:43.775
We must set her free.

03:19.339 --> 03:22.240
Why do you go
among the people, Majesty?

03:22.309 --> 03:24.743
I tell you plainly,
you will be murdered.

03:24.812 --> 03:27.576
Every Catholic in England
is a potential assassin!

03:27.648 --> 03:30.048
Be warned
by the atrocities in France.

03:30.117 --> 03:33.018
We know the Catholics take
their orders from Spain.

03:33.087 --> 03:35.954
The Spanish speak
openly of Mary Stuart

03:36.023 --> 03:37.923
as Queen of England
in waiting.

03:37.991 --> 03:40.016
Their loyalty is to
the Pope in Rome!

03:40.094 --> 03:43.222
How many Catholics
are there in England, sir?

03:43.297 --> 03:44.787
Immense numbers,
Majesty.

03:44.865 --> 03:49.063
Half the nation cling
to the old superstitions.

03:49.169 --> 03:51.501
What would you have me do?

03:51.572 --> 03:55.474
Hang half the people of
England or just imprison them?

03:55.542 --> 03:57.976
We must act, Majesty.

03:58.045 --> 04:00.878
Our inaction is perceived as weakness.

04:01.014 --> 04:04.450
If my people break the law,
they shall be punished.

04:04.518 --> 04:06.816
Until that day,
they shall be protected.

04:06.887 --> 04:10.379
Majesty, we have proven reason
to fear every Catholic in the...

04:10.457 --> 04:13.449
Fear creates fear.

04:13.527 --> 04:17.553
I am not ignorant
of the dangers, sir.

04:17.630 --> 04:21.327
But I will not punish my
people for their beliefs.

04:21.401 --> 04:23.699
Only for their deeds.

04:23.770 --> 04:27.331
I am assured that the people
of England love their Queen.

04:27.508 --> 04:30.272
My constant endeavor
is to earn that love.

04:30.344 --> 04:35.646
Fotheringhay Castle - Mary Queen of Scots' prison

04:58.972 --> 05:00.530
My Queen.

05:17.558 --> 05:19.856
Our friends write
to give us hope.

05:19.927 --> 05:22.452
Soon England's
true believers will rise up

05:22.529 --> 05:25.157
against the bastard
usurper Elizabeth

05:25.232 --> 05:26.995
and slit her throat.

05:27.067 --> 05:28.694
That's enough!

05:31.305 --> 05:34.604
Slit her throat? Please.

05:34.675 --> 05:39.806
And when that bastard usurper
is dead, my lady will be queen.

05:46.320 --> 05:49.414
Your bishops are preaching that
God is showing his displeasure

05:49.489 --> 05:51.684
because the Queen
is still unmarried,

05:51.758 --> 05:54.192
some rudely
suggesting infertile.

05:55.329 --> 05:56.353
What nonsense.

05:56.430 --> 05:58.455
Dangerous nonsense.

05:58.532 --> 06:01.126
Mary Stuart has a son.

06:01.201 --> 06:04.364
Why does everyone
torment me with Mary Stuart?

06:04.438 --> 06:06.736
It's not her fault she's
next in line to the throne.

06:06.807 --> 06:07.796
Don't hide your face.

06:07.874 --> 06:09.466
So long as you
have no issue.

06:09.543 --> 06:10.976
If you were
to produce an heir,

06:11.044 --> 06:12.909
there'd be no more talk
of Mary, Queen of Scots.

06:12.980 --> 06:16.438
I've heard it's customary to obtain
a husband before producing an heir.

06:18.285 --> 06:20.515
We shall have to hunt out a
husband for you soon, Bess.

06:20.587 --> 06:21.918
Not too soon,
my lady.

06:21.989 --> 06:23.513
There are husbands
to be had.

06:23.590 --> 06:24.989
You don't want
to be married?

06:25.058 --> 06:26.457
I'll want to be married
if I want the man...

06:26.526 --> 06:28.153
Austria. France.

06:28.228 --> 06:31.197
Turkey. Turkey has a sultan.
China has an emperor.

06:31.265 --> 06:33.733
I confine myself
to the possible.

06:33.800 --> 06:36.462
That's where you and I
differ, Walsingham.

06:36.536 --> 06:39.369
I find the impossible
far more interesting.

06:42.843 --> 06:44.071
What kind of man
would you want?

06:44.144 --> 06:47.113
An honest man
with friendly eyes.

06:47.180 --> 06:49.614
And good legs.
And sweet breath.

06:49.683 --> 06:51.878
So you can kiss him
without choking.

06:55.255 --> 06:57.052
There must be
any amount of princes

06:57.124 --> 06:59.524
in the undiscovered lands
across the sea.

07:02.229 --> 07:03.958
Find me an honest one
of those.

07:21.114 --> 07:23.947
Since when do we discuss
private matters in public spaces?

07:24.017 --> 07:26.144
I ask Your Majesty's
forgiveness.

07:26.219 --> 07:30.485
Have my doctors confirm that
the Queen is still fertile.

07:30.991 --> 07:32.356
The people need
to be reassured.

07:32.426 --> 07:33.450
I care
for your safety.

07:33.527 --> 07:35.825
The threats to your
person are real.

07:35.896 --> 07:37.454
You know very well
if I fall,

07:37.531 --> 07:40.523
you'll all come
tumbling down after me.

07:40.600 --> 07:42.693
The sea wall at Dover
is cracking, Francis.

07:42.769 --> 07:45.897
We have no money
to rebuild our defenses.

07:45.972 --> 07:48.372
Turn your mind
to that threat.

08:02.756 --> 08:07.125
May we have wisdom not to
fear shadows in the night.

08:09.196 --> 08:13.758
And courage when the day
of danger truly dawns.

08:24.897 --> 08:27.615
I sacrifice Spain's forests...

08:27.942 --> 08:32.844
to build the greatest fleet
that ever sailed.

08:34.128 --> 08:35.501
Elizabeth...

08:35.830 --> 08:40.495
why are you leading
your people to hell?

08:43.572 --> 08:44.794
Whore.

08:47.768 --> 08:50.066
My time has come,
Majesty.

08:51.271 --> 08:54.536
Send me back to England
to begin God's work.

09:16.530 --> 09:17.997
Your Majesty.

09:36.450 --> 09:38.645
Guards!
Take hold of him!

09:41.121 --> 09:43.589
A puddle in the way,

09:44.257 --> 09:45.622
Majesty.

09:50.897 --> 09:52.694
A puddle.

10:15.956 --> 10:17.150
Puddle.

10:24.197 --> 10:26.188
You'll have to see
the Lord Chamberlain, sir.

10:26.266 --> 10:27.494
Which one is he?

10:27.567 --> 10:29.364
He's over there.

10:29.469 --> 10:31.130
You can't come in.

10:31.238 --> 10:33.706
So how am I to see him
if you won't let me through?

10:33.773 --> 10:35.832
You must wait for him
to come out.

10:35.909 --> 10:36.898
And when will he
come out?

10:36.977 --> 10:38.137
There's no way
of knowing that.

10:38.211 --> 10:41.772
I had less trouble than
this boarding a Spanish ship.

10:43.884 --> 10:47.980
What if enemy ships should sail up
the Thames, can the docks be closed?

10:48.054 --> 10:50.181
Not closed, Majesty.
But the gun positions...

10:50.257 --> 10:51.952
Spanish...

10:56.663 --> 10:58.324
Ambassador.

11:00.534 --> 11:02.468
King Eric of Sweden,
Majesty.

11:02.536 --> 11:03.833
Not again.

11:03.904 --> 11:04.996
Still madly in love with you.

11:05.071 --> 11:06.163
Still mad, you mean.

11:06.239 --> 11:09.299
Ivan, Tsar
of all the Russias.

11:09.376 --> 11:10.843
Where's Bess?

11:10.944 --> 11:14.004
Known as
"Ivan the Terrible," Majesty.

11:21.154 --> 11:22.348
Late.

11:22.422 --> 11:24.720
I beg
Your Majesty's forgiveness.

11:25.058 --> 11:26.923
Given.

11:30.030 --> 11:31.895
Once.

11:31.965 --> 11:35.093
The Archduke
Charles of Austria, Majesty.

11:39.139 --> 11:41.699
The puddle man
is outside, Majesty.

11:41.775 --> 11:42.901
My suitors.

11:42.976 --> 11:46.503
Younger brother to Maximilian
II, Holy Roman Emperor.

11:46.580 --> 11:49.105
Cousin of Philip of Spain.
Wealthy.

11:49.182 --> 11:51.810
He's rather handsome.

11:54.254 --> 11:55.278
How old is he?

11:55.355 --> 11:57.823
Young,
I believe, Majesty.

11:59.292 --> 12:01.590
An Austrian alliance
would keep France quiet.

12:01.661 --> 12:03.959
And put Philip on a leash.

12:04.030 --> 12:05.964
I've become
almost enthusiastic.

12:07.701 --> 12:09.965
Send for him.

12:10.236 --> 12:11.396
<i>Danke schön.</i>

12:12.572 --> 12:16.064
How much longer do you think
I can play this game, Francis?

12:16.142 --> 12:19.168
Virginity is an asset
that holds its value well.

12:19.245 --> 12:21.179
Walter Raleigh, Majesty.

12:21.387 --> 12:23.077
Lousy pirate!

12:23.116 --> 12:26.244
Your Majesty, this man
is a notorious pirate.

12:26.319 --> 12:31.188
Spanish gold stolen from Spanish
ships, attacked without provocation.

12:35.028 --> 12:38.623
Well, sir, what do you want?

12:38.698 --> 12:41.861
I have just returned
from the New World, Majesty.

12:41.935 --> 12:44.563
I have claimed the
fertile coast in your name

12:44.638 --> 12:47.368
and called it Virginia

12:47.440 --> 12:49.874
in honor
of our Virgin Queen.

12:49.943 --> 12:51.774
Virginia?

12:51.845 --> 12:55.611
And when I marry, will you
change the name to Conjugia?

12:56.916 --> 12:58.747
I ask your gracious
permission, Majesty,

12:58.818 --> 13:01.514
to return to the New World
with your royal warrant

13:01.588 --> 13:04.557
to found a colony under the
laws and protections of England.

13:04.624 --> 13:05.886
He wants money.

13:05.959 --> 13:08.223
Who are they?

13:08.294 --> 13:10.694
Natives of the
Americas, Majesty.

13:14.501 --> 13:16.196
Have they no ruler
of their own?

13:16.269 --> 13:19.067
None to match
England's Queen.

13:19.139 --> 13:20.629
These gentlemen
are welcome.

13:20.707 --> 13:22.538
See that they
are treated well.

13:22.609 --> 13:24.600
I also come bearing
gifts for Your Majesty.

13:24.678 --> 13:29.240
These gifts, Majesty,
are the fruits of piracy,

13:29.315 --> 13:31.579
the true property
of the realm of Spain.

13:31.651 --> 13:35.212
Let's see, shall we?
What have you brought me?

13:43.797 --> 13:46.664
<i>Patata, Majesty.</i>

13:46.733 --> 13:49.793
You eat it.
Very nourishing.

14:09.956 --> 14:11.548
Tobacco.

14:13.359 --> 14:15.884
You breathe its smoke.

14:15.962 --> 14:19.090
Very stimulating.

14:29.776 --> 14:31.175
Gold.

14:31.911 --> 14:35.540
Courtesy of a Spanish ship that found
itself unable to complete its journey.

14:35.615 --> 14:37.674
Forgive me, Majesty.

14:37.751 --> 14:41.482
I find the air
has become stale.

14:41.554 --> 14:45.081
I am sensitive to the
smell of open sewers.

14:51.798 --> 14:56.201
I cannot accept the fruits
of piracy, Mr. Raleigh.

14:56.269 --> 15:00.069
Philip of Spain is no friend
of England, Majesty.

15:00.140 --> 15:04.509
The more gold I take from him,
the safer you will be.

15:04.577 --> 15:07.102
Well, well.

15:07.180 --> 15:09.114
A political pirate.

15:09.182 --> 15:13.084
And Your Majesty's
most loyal subject.

15:13.386 --> 15:17.254
Welcome home, Mr. Raleigh.
Lord Howard, the docks.

15:18.024 --> 15:20.117
Master Raleigh.

15:24.931 --> 15:26.296
You eat it...

15:37.048 --> 15:40.531
You pirates have gone too far.

15:41.058 --> 15:43.627
My King is very angry.

15:49.088 --> 15:51.181
You traitor!

15:51.491 --> 15:53.152
Judas!

15:53.793 --> 15:55.784
You're Walsingham's pawn!

15:56.863 --> 15:59.627
Don't do this!
I didn't say anything!

16:00.600 --> 16:03.296
You're a
Protestant traitor!

16:04.237 --> 16:05.864
Don't do it! Don't!

16:16.015 --> 16:17.243
Don't!
Hold his head!

16:17.317 --> 16:19.842
You Judas! You Judas!
Stop!

16:19.919 --> 16:21.250
You Judas!

16:48.381 --> 16:51.248
The traitor's dead.
We must act!

16:55.722 --> 16:59.158
Why do we not strike?
What are we waiting for?

17:02.228 --> 17:05.288
You wait for my order.

17:08.468 --> 17:13.201
Walsingham knows too much
already. One traitor is dead.

17:14.007 --> 17:16.976
Who can I trust now?

17:24.250 --> 17:26.650
There's a visitor
waiting, sir.

17:31.391 --> 17:33.689
William.

17:35.762 --> 17:37.730
Hello, Francis.

17:37.797 --> 17:41.289
You've always been a fellow
who delighted in surprises.

17:41.367 --> 17:43.267
You look well,
Francis.

17:43.369 --> 17:47.362
Well, you look dreadful.
They're not feeding you in Paris.

17:47.473 --> 17:50.909
You can't learn the secrets of
the universe on an empty stomach.

17:51.411 --> 17:55.245
<i>Then she my heart beguiled</i>

17:55.315 --> 17:59.775
Mary. William.
Supper is ready.

18:01.621 --> 18:03.350
William.

18:03.423 --> 18:04.913
Have you spoken
to the Queen?

18:04.991 --> 18:06.117
I speak
with the Queen daily.

18:06.192 --> 18:08.126
You work too hard.
You're a sick man.

18:08.194 --> 18:09.821
William, come over here and sit by me.

18:09.896 --> 18:11.295
William, if we are not
allowed to sin,

18:11.364 --> 18:12.558
maybe we could
talk theology.

18:12.632 --> 18:15.533
You have done enough.
No man could do more.

18:15.601 --> 18:17.831
I can't leave the court
yet, Ursula. She needs me.

18:17.904 --> 18:19.599
Never listens to me.
Not a thought for his health.

18:19.672 --> 18:21.071
So you talk to him,
he's your brother.

18:21.140 --> 18:25.042
William, what do they say in Paris
about the Pope's call for holy war?

18:25.111 --> 18:26.135
Many welcome it.

18:26.212 --> 18:27.941
Why must we talk
about war?

18:28.014 --> 18:30.209
Tell us your nice
news, William.

18:30.283 --> 18:32.410
Are you married yet?
Not yet.

18:32.485 --> 18:34.749
Mary, would you leave
William alone, please?

18:34.821 --> 18:37.585
Sweet, sit.

18:38.958 --> 18:40.118
Grace?

18:41.327 --> 18:43.318
Oh, Lord,
provider of all things,

18:43.396 --> 18:45.387
we offer Thee
our humble thanks.

18:45.465 --> 18:48.366
In the name
of the Holy Trinity, amen.

18:48.434 --> 18:49.560
Amen.

18:58.378 --> 19:01.438
More lines on my face.

19:03.683 --> 19:05.810
Where do they come from?

19:05.885 --> 19:08.012
Smile lines, my lady.

19:08.087 --> 19:10.385
Smile lines?

19:11.524 --> 19:14.254
When do I ever smile?

19:16.696 --> 19:19.893
Now you have
smile lines, too.

19:25.638 --> 19:31.076
<i>The beauty of Your Majesty</i>

19:31.144 --> 19:35.513
<i>is dazzling to my eyes.</i>

19:43.189 --> 19:46.852
I am overwhelmed.

19:46.926 --> 19:50.362
I am conquered.

19:50.430 --> 19:52.990
I die.

19:53.066 --> 19:56.092
Only your love,

19:56.169 --> 19:58.797
<i>my stattlich Elizabeth,</i>

19:58.871 --> 20:00.998
can restore me into life.

20:02.141 --> 20:05.201
Your Highness
does me great honor.

20:13.853 --> 20:16.048
Oh, Elizabeth.

20:16.289 --> 20:21.625
How blessed am I to stand
in your fabled presence.

20:22.929 --> 20:25.420
Ah, Elizabeth.

20:25.498 --> 20:27.762
To speak your name
is to hear celestial music.

20:31.571 --> 20:35.063
May that sweet sound

20:35.141 --> 20:38.941
guide me through my life
to come, Elizabeth.

20:40.179 --> 20:44.843
I have traveled here
to this illustrious court

20:45.051 --> 20:48.987
in the hope that
our two great nations

20:50.289 --> 20:52.689
might be
joined in love.

21:06.839 --> 21:08.704
He interests me.

21:10.977 --> 21:13.036
Talk to him.

21:13.112 --> 21:16.309
Him, my lady?

21:16.382 --> 21:17.542
Him.

21:22.421 --> 21:26.187
I adore the natives you brought. I
don't suppose you could get one for me.

21:26.259 --> 21:27.692
They're not
dangerous, are they?

21:27.760 --> 21:29.591
That depends on what you
propose to do with them.

21:29.662 --> 21:32.130
I'd dress him up in
mulberry colored silk,

21:32.198 --> 21:35.133
and have him walk behind
me, carrying my cloak.

21:43.309 --> 21:45.709
I have a secret,
my dear.

21:47.547 --> 21:50.175
I pretend there's
a pane of glass,

21:50.249 --> 21:54.208
<i>eine Glasscheibe
between me and them.</i>

21:56.189 --> 21:59.750
They can see me,
but they cannot touch me.

22:01.861 --> 22:03.988
You should try it.

22:06.365 --> 22:09.926
Majesty, I am...

22:19.011 --> 22:20.876
It is something,
after all,

22:20.947 --> 22:26.385
to take a blank on the map
and build there a shining city.

22:26.452 --> 22:30.013
Which you will no doubt
name after yourself.

22:30.089 --> 22:31.556
No doubt.

22:39.098 --> 22:40.963
May I ask
a question in return?

22:41.033 --> 22:42.057
Of course.

22:42.134 --> 22:44.398
How am I to win
the Queen's favor?

22:44.470 --> 22:45.937
Why should I tell you that?

22:46.005 --> 22:49.338
I've little enough to offer,
but whatever I have to give,

22:50.276 --> 22:53.370
ask, and it's yours.

22:55.615 --> 22:58.880
Say what you mean to say
as plainly as possible.

22:59.652 --> 23:03.281
All men flatter the Queen
in hope of advancement.

23:05.625 --> 23:08.059
Pay her the compliment
of truth.

23:08.127 --> 23:09.958
I don't even know
your name.

23:10.596 --> 23:11.620
Elizabeth Throckmorton.

23:11.697 --> 23:13.665
A second
Elizabeth?

23:13.733 --> 23:15.963
Everyone calls me Bess.

23:16.035 --> 23:21.029
Your most serene Majesty,
bright star of our firmament,

23:21.107 --> 23:26.010
we present our humble masque
of the heavenly spheres.

23:28.748 --> 23:31.740
His Highness is tired
after his long journey.

23:31.817 --> 23:34.877
No man
can become tired

23:34.954 --> 23:38.822
in the presence of
so lovely a queen.

23:39.191 --> 23:41.489
You play the game very well,
my young friend...

23:41.961 --> 23:45.522
but don't you sometimes feel...

23:45.765 --> 23:48.393
an overwhelming desire to say
what you're really thinking?

23:49.869 --> 23:53.100
I daren't even think
what I'm really thinking.

23:49.869 --> 23:53.100
You're thinking, perhaps...

23:55.441 --> 23:59.810
that you'd far rather be home.

24:00.846 --> 24:06.148
You're very wise, your majesty.

24:11.924 --> 24:16.623
His Highness, the Archduke informs
me that my charms overwhelm him.

24:16.696 --> 24:20.462
He will retire to his
private chambers to rest.

24:28.741 --> 24:32.108
I don't want him hurt
by your schemes.

24:32.178 --> 24:34.772
So how should
we proceed?

24:34.847 --> 24:37.077
Perhaps we should
all retire.

24:39.752 --> 24:43.916
I suspect him of being
a professional charmer.

24:43.989 --> 24:45.149
Am I right?

24:45.224 --> 24:48.159
He is certainly
charming, my lady.

24:48.661 --> 24:51.630
Well, there are
duller professions.

24:52.798 --> 24:54.663
You like him, don't you?

24:54.734 --> 24:57.225
He's a man that lives in a
world far beyond the court.

24:58.938 --> 25:01.406
It's refreshing.

25:01.474 --> 25:03.237
Well.

25:03.309 --> 25:05.436
We shall let him
come again.

25:06.712 --> 25:07.804
Blue.

25:13.853 --> 25:17.016
<i>Can you imagine
what it is to cross an ocean?</i>

25:17.857 --> 25:23.056
For weeks, you see nothing but
the horizon, perfect and empty.

25:24.663 --> 25:27.632
You live in the grip of fear.

25:27.933 --> 25:29.457
Fear of storms.

25:30.603 --> 25:33.003
Fear of sickness on board.

25:34.006 --> 25:36.566
Fear of the immensity.

25:37.743 --> 25:41.179
So you must drive that fear
down deep into your belly.

25:42.381 --> 25:44.281
Study your charts.

25:45.050 --> 25:46.950
Watch your compass.

25:47.720 --> 25:49.813
Pray for a fair wind.

25:51.090 --> 25:53.388
And hope,

25:54.560 --> 25:55.720
pure,

25:56.395 --> 25:57.862
naked,

25:58.531 --> 26:00.260
fragile

26:01.333 --> 26:03.198
hope.

26:05.471 --> 26:07.905
Majesty, the Archduke
and court are waiting.

26:07.973 --> 26:09.873
Let them wait.

26:11.343 --> 26:13.402
Go on, Mr. Raleigh.

26:14.980 --> 26:17.540
You were hoping.

26:17.850 --> 26:21.217
At first, it's no more
than a haze on the horizon.

26:26.559 --> 26:28.459
So you watch.

26:31.397 --> 26:33.126
You watch.

26:37.503 --> 26:39.562
Then it's a smudge,

26:41.407 --> 26:44.376
a shadow on the far water.

26:45.511 --> 26:47.376
For a day.

26:48.314 --> 26:50.214
For another day.

26:52.117 --> 26:57.714
The stain slowly spreads
along the horizon taking form,

26:59.058 --> 27:03.927
until on the third day,
you let yourself believe.

27:05.598 --> 27:08.294
You dare to whisper
the word.

27:09.702 --> 27:11.329
Land.

27:14.106 --> 27:15.505
Land.

27:16.275 --> 27:17.765
Life.

27:18.911 --> 27:20.936
Resurrection.

27:21.947 --> 27:24.609
The true adventure.

27:25.451 --> 27:28.443
Coming out of
the vast unknown,

27:28.521 --> 27:30.716
out of the immensity,

27:31.790 --> 27:34.122
into new life.

27:36.962 --> 27:38.293
That,

27:39.498 --> 27:42.524
Your Majesty,
is the New World.

27:52.578 --> 27:55.979
I like
your immensities.

27:56.048 --> 28:02.385
Your ocean is an image
of eternity, I think.

28:02.454 --> 28:06.914
Such great spaces
make us small.

28:06.992 --> 28:10.792
Do we discover the
New World, Mr. Raleigh,

28:10.863 --> 28:14.355
or does the New World
discover us?

28:14.433 --> 28:17.266
You speak like
a true explorer.

28:18.804 --> 28:20.772
I like you,
Mr. Raleigh.

28:24.710 --> 28:27.076
And I like you.

28:34.153 --> 28:38.681
You know, of course, that when
I like a man, I reward him.

28:38.757 --> 28:42.022
I have heard that.

28:42.127 --> 28:43.992
And what have you
to say about it?

28:44.063 --> 28:46.429
Reward my mission,
Majesty, not me.

28:46.498 --> 28:48.796
Is the mission
not the man?

28:48.867 --> 28:51.802
Then you leave me free
to like you in return.

28:57.977 --> 28:59.672
Go on.

29:02.181 --> 29:04.581
I think it must be hard
for so great a queen

29:04.650 --> 29:08.552
to know the simple pleasure
of being liked for herself.

29:14.893 --> 29:16.952
Now you grow dull.

29:54.066 --> 29:55.533
Come on!

30:22.394 --> 30:23.986
Mine.

30:25.597 --> 30:27.724
You have
the stronger horse.

30:27.800 --> 30:29.665
Yours carries
the lighter load.

30:29.735 --> 30:31.168
No.

30:32.571 --> 30:34.869
The Queen does not
give way to others.

30:36.375 --> 30:38.138
Whoa! Whoa!

30:45.184 --> 30:49.052
Forgive me, Majesty. My horse
doesn't seem to know his place yet.

30:50.823 --> 30:53.792
Have you ever known
your place, Mr. Raleigh?

30:57.896 --> 30:59.830
Oh, come on!

31:31.430 --> 31:32.988
It's from her.

31:33.966 --> 31:37.629
Mary Stuart is the heart
and soul of our enterprise.

31:50.549 --> 31:53.382
Make sure she
and only she reads this.

31:53.852 --> 31:55.911
We wait for her order.

31:57.656 --> 32:00.124
The order
must be given clearly.

32:09.268 --> 32:11.133
The jailer, madam.

32:14.206 --> 32:16.265
My noble jailer.

32:19.545 --> 32:22.343
Am I a danger to England
even when I pray?

32:22.414 --> 32:25.679
As always, ma'am, my
concern is for your safety.

32:29.021 --> 32:31.455
I pray for
my cousin Elizabeth.

32:34.226 --> 32:36.626
Do you think
she prays for me?

32:44.870 --> 32:46.337
Is it true

32:48.006 --> 32:51.840
that I've never known the
pleasure of being liked for myself?

32:54.346 --> 32:57.645
I hope you believe I like
you for yourself, my lady.

32:59.918 --> 33:04.821
Is anyone ever liked simply
for themselves? I doubt it.

33:05.924 --> 33:07.687
Are you?

33:09.228 --> 33:13.392
Men like you
because you're pretty,

33:15.400 --> 33:18.892
and because you have
the ear of the Queen.

33:19.004 --> 33:21.472
No doubt.

33:22.841 --> 33:24.934
Him, too.

33:27.746 --> 33:30.442
He likes you because
he wants my favor.

33:33.585 --> 33:36.486
You do realize that.

33:38.557 --> 33:40.548
Yes, my lady.

33:42.394 --> 33:45.488
And the other thing,
too, of course.

33:45.564 --> 33:47.429
But then,
all men want that.

33:47.499 --> 33:50.832
Male desire
confers no distinction.

33:52.471 --> 33:55.065
Oh, I envy you, Bess.

33:58.277 --> 34:01.804
You're free to have
what I cannot have.

34:03.715 --> 34:05.512
You're my adventurer.

34:56.101 --> 34:57.693
Thank you for coming.

34:57.769 --> 35:00.363
You mustn't send
letters to the palace.

35:00.439 --> 35:02.134
You know what would
happen if I was caught.

35:02.207 --> 35:04.107
I need your help.

35:05.344 --> 35:07.608
More money?
No.

35:09.014 --> 35:11.005
My father doesn't want
to hide like this anymore.

35:11.083 --> 35:12.072
Of course.

35:12.150 --> 35:14.448
We both want to get back
into favor with the court.

35:14.519 --> 35:16.043
That's impossible.

35:17.022 --> 35:18.216
You know that
you're Papists.

35:18.290 --> 35:19.655
Why impossible?

35:19.725 --> 35:22.319
Everyone at court has a Papist
somewhere in their family.

35:22.394 --> 35:23.827
Francis.
Just as you have.

35:23.895 --> 35:26.864
Speak to the Queen.
You are her favorite.

35:26.932 --> 35:30.493
My father and I
will embrace the new faith.

35:30.569 --> 35:31.729
Cousin Bess.
No.

35:31.803 --> 35:33.794
We have known each other all our lives.

35:33.872 --> 35:36.966
I would do nothing
to harm you.

35:37.709 --> 35:40.473
Why can't you help us?
They will kill us!

35:53.058 --> 35:57.392
Oh. Do not tease me,
Mr. Raleigh.

35:57.462 --> 35:59.828
There's nothing
I'd like to do more.

35:59.898 --> 36:01.160
So why don't you?

36:03.268 --> 36:05.896
All right, then. I will.

36:08.140 --> 36:10.301
You see? You lie.

36:10.375 --> 36:13.401
You don't want me on your
ship at all. You're a liar.

36:17.416 --> 36:19.111
Bess. Would you
like to go to sea?

36:19.184 --> 36:20.776
I'm afraid
that's not possible.

36:20.852 --> 36:23.685
Women bring bad luck
on board ship.

36:23.755 --> 36:25.017
Do they?

36:25.090 --> 36:27.490
Lock up a hundred men in a
space smaller than this room

36:27.559 --> 36:29.823
for months at a time.

36:29.895 --> 36:31.157
Men have needs.

36:31.229 --> 36:33.959
A beautiful woman
would drive us all mad.

36:34.833 --> 36:36.994
Men have needs?

36:40.639 --> 36:44.370
Let them stay on land
and see to their needs.

36:44.910 --> 36:49.040
Mr. Raleigh is eager to sail
away to his maiden colony.

36:49.114 --> 36:54.211
We must persuade him to stay a
little longer. Mustn't we, ladies?

37:10.735 --> 37:12.168
Bess?

37:17.008 --> 37:17.997
No!

37:18.343 --> 37:22.074
Wait! What do you want?
Who are you?

37:22.147 --> 37:25.913
Let me go, damn it!
Who the hell are you?

37:52.611 --> 37:57.071
If you won't assist me,
perhaps your father will.

37:57.149 --> 37:58.741
No.

38:03.655 --> 38:07.618
Enough.

38:08.760 --> 38:10.421
Enough.

38:11.463 --> 38:12.862
Yes?

38:14.799 --> 38:18.257
You cannot
save England now.

38:19.171 --> 38:21.662
The Enterprise
has begun.

38:25.477 --> 38:27.741
Ambassador?

38:29.581 --> 38:31.310
What do you know of the
Enterprise of England?

38:31.383 --> 38:33.578
The Enterprise? Forgive me,
Majesty, I'm not familiar...

38:33.652 --> 38:37.088
Two armies landing on the
coasts of Sussex and Norfolk.

38:37.155 --> 38:40.090
Mary Stuart is to be set free
and placed on the English throne,

38:40.158 --> 38:41.955
and I am to be
assassinated.

38:42.027 --> 38:43.460
Does any of this
sound familiar?

38:43.528 --> 38:44.756
I know nothing
of any invasion plans...

38:44.829 --> 38:46.990
Well, I refer to this plan
as the Enterprise of England,

38:47.065 --> 38:50.034
<i>it should more accurately be
called la Empresa de Inglaterra</i>

38:50.101 --> 38:51.898
because it is
a Spanish plan.

38:51.970 --> 38:53.870
The plan of my
one-time brother-in-law,

38:53.939 --> 38:55.804
your king,
to attack my country.

38:55.874 --> 39:00.004
Your country? It is my
country that is under attack.

39:01.213 --> 39:04.273
<i>Your so-called piratas, your pirates
attack our merchant ships daily.</i>

39:04.349 --> 39:08.683
And you... You think we don't
know where the orders come from?

39:08.753 --> 39:11.551
The whole world knows these
pirates sail up the Thames,

39:11.623 --> 39:15.423
all the way
to your royal bed.

39:23.735 --> 39:28.069
You will leave
my presence, sir.

39:28.139 --> 39:30.972
Go back to your rat hole.

39:31.109 --> 39:36.445
Tell Philip I fear neither him,
nor his priests, nor his armies.

39:36.514 --> 39:38.880
Tell him if he wants to shake
his little fist at us,

39:38.950 --> 39:40.178
we're ready to give him
such a bite,

39:40.252 --> 39:42.049
he'll wish he'd kept his hands
in his pockets.

39:42.120 --> 39:46.181
You see a leaf fall and you think
you know which way the wind blows.

39:46.258 --> 39:50.991
Well, there is
a wind coming, madam,

39:51.062 --> 39:53.360
that will sweep away
your pride.

39:59.671 --> 40:02.196
I, too, can command
the wind, sir!

40:02.274 --> 40:06.802
I have a hurricane in me that will
strip Spain bare if you dare to try me!

40:28.800 --> 40:31.291
What are you staring at?

40:31.369 --> 40:34.964
Lower your eyes.
I am the Queen!

40:35.907 --> 40:39.138
You are not my equal, sir,
and you never will be!

40:46.821 --> 40:47.905
Majesty,

40:48.113 --> 40:50.199
Elizabeth has come to know
of our enterprise.

40:50.449 --> 40:53.202
Then we will attack as soon as possible.

40:53.786 --> 40:56.330
God has abandoned Elizabeth.

40:56.664 --> 41:00.835
England must be crushed.

41:01.043 --> 41:02.378
Certainly, majesty.

41:02.628 --> 41:04.839
What news of the Jesuit?

41:05.172 --> 41:07.716
His mission proceeds as planned, majesty.

41:08.008 --> 41:12.513
The fleet must be ready to sail in a month.

41:12.763 --> 41:14.056
That's impossible, majesty!

41:14.139 --> 41:17.101
Impossible is not God.

41:17.184 --> 41:18.269
Only a miracle.

41:18.352 --> 41:19.979
Exactly...

41:20.396 --> 41:23.232
a miracle.

41:24.150 --> 41:26.527
God's miracle.

41:27.528 --> 41:30.781
Yes, majesty.

41:57.889 --> 42:01.689
<i>The alignments of the planets
is most unusual this year.</i>

42:02.894 --> 42:04.862
Mars is due to take
the ascendant

42:04.929 --> 42:09.025
three days after the anniversary
of Your Majesty's birth.

42:09.100 --> 42:12.536
And also on that day,
there is a full moon,

42:12.604 --> 42:17.769
which governs the fortune of
all princes of the female gender.

42:17.842 --> 42:19.935
Princes of the
female gender.

42:20.011 --> 42:24.710
I mean to say, a prince
who is also a woman.

42:24.783 --> 42:28.219
Yes, Dr. Dee,
I am following you.

42:28.286 --> 42:30.447
What does it mean?

42:30.522 --> 42:37.394
It means the rise of a great empire,
Majesty, and the fall of another.

42:38.163 --> 42:39.596
Convulsions.

42:43.134 --> 42:47.298
Which empire is to rise
and which is to fall?

42:47.372 --> 42:49.602
That I cannot say,
Majesty.

42:49.674 --> 42:53.735
Astrology is, as yet,
more an art than a science.

42:53.812 --> 42:56.246
Nothing more, Dr. Dee?

42:56.314 --> 42:58.942
No more specific calamities
we can guard against?

42:59.017 --> 43:03.420
He means,
will I be assassinated?

43:03.488 --> 43:06.389
Walsingham, would you
leave us for a moment?

43:13.264 --> 43:18.668
And the private life of this
prince of the female gender,

43:18.736 --> 43:20.897
what do the stars
foretell there?

43:20.972 --> 43:23.770
These are matters
of state, Majesty.

43:23.842 --> 43:27.972
Surely the stars foretell
matters of state, Dr. Dee.

43:28.046 --> 43:33.484
For such a prediction I must
look in a different chart.

43:42.827 --> 43:44.852
Wonderful.

43:46.030 --> 43:48.191
Such strength.

43:48.299 --> 43:52.360
You will need all your
strength in the days to come.

43:53.204 --> 43:57.231
But you doubt yourself,
my child.

43:57.709 --> 44:01.475
I have not seen fear in your
face for such a long time.

44:01.846 --> 44:03.040
Have I reason to fear?

44:03.114 --> 44:05.344
Something has
weakened you.

44:07.018 --> 44:10.181
There are
hard days coming.

44:14.259 --> 44:16.557
But I am no prophet.

44:17.228 --> 44:20.664
I see no more than
the shadows of ghosts.

44:24.836 --> 44:26.804
Visitor, sir.

44:38.516 --> 44:39.744
Sorry to come
aboard your ship

44:39.817 --> 44:41.978
without permission,
Mr. Raleigh.

44:51.996 --> 44:54.089
Welcome aboard.

44:54.899 --> 44:57.026
The Queen wishes
to see you.

44:59.837 --> 45:01.099
She asks me
to assure you...

45:01.172 --> 45:03.265
I need
no assurances, Bess.

45:04.676 --> 45:07.270
I'm no courtier.
Never have been.

45:07.345 --> 45:09.836
Then you should
say so in person.

45:17.689 --> 45:19.953
This is
my life, Bess.

45:21.426 --> 45:23.326
This is where
I belong.

45:26.965 --> 45:29.399
It seems to be
a lonely life.

45:29.467 --> 45:33.369
Sometimes. But it's
the life I've chosen.

45:36.841 --> 45:38.866
I understand.

45:54.425 --> 45:56.950
You ask permission to go.

45:57.028 --> 45:58.996
Yes, Majesty.

45:59.063 --> 46:02.521
You plan to return
to your colony

46:02.600 --> 46:07.060
for two, maybe three,
four years.

46:07.138 --> 46:10.574
If Your Majesty grants me
your royal warrant.

46:11.576 --> 46:13.976
That is a long time.

46:14.045 --> 46:17.344
There's nothing
for me here.

46:17.415 --> 46:20.851
At sea, I know what I'm
to do. I know the risks.

46:20.918 --> 46:23.250
Here...
No. You're wrong.

46:23.321 --> 46:26.757
You're needed here.

46:26.824 --> 46:28.621
As captain of my
personal guard.

46:28.693 --> 46:29.990
Captain of your guard?

46:30.061 --> 46:31.050
Kneel.

46:31.129 --> 46:32.619
Majesty.

46:32.697 --> 46:35.097
I said, kneel.

46:39.837 --> 46:42.431
Sir Walter Raleigh.

46:46.944 --> 46:52.678
Well, you may express
your gratitude.

46:55.086 --> 46:58.214
This is too great an honor.

46:58.956 --> 47:02.687
If it's so great an honor, why
are you staring at your boots?

47:03.428 --> 47:05.089
You know why.

47:06.330 --> 47:08.389
Now you stare
at the wall.

47:08.466 --> 47:10.798
Am I so hideous you can't
even look me in the face?

47:10.868 --> 47:11.892
Why do you speak
like a fool

47:11.969 --> 47:15.029
when you are anything
but a fool?

47:15.106 --> 47:16.698
Fool?

47:19.010 --> 47:22.537
Yes, I am a vain
and foolish woman.

47:22.613 --> 47:25.673
And you, you...
You come here

47:25.750 --> 47:29.083
as if from another time.
And I've...

47:31.189 --> 47:35.853
You have real adventures. You
go where the maps end. And I'd...

47:36.728 --> 47:40.721
I would follow you there
if I could. Believe me.

47:51.242 --> 47:55.008
The storm clouds are
gathering. You are needed here.

47:56.547 --> 47:58.606
You cannot leave England.

48:30.114 --> 48:33.242
"For he that will save
his life will lose it.

48:33.384 --> 48:37.480
<i>"And he that will lose his life
for my sake shall find it. "</i>

48:38.790 --> 48:41.657
Lord be with us
as the end approaches.

48:43.861 --> 48:47.422
We will not fear the coming
of the shadow of death.

49:06.884 --> 49:10.115
Sorry, I didn't mean
to disturb you.

49:10.188 --> 49:12.588
I thought I prayed
in silence.

49:12.657 --> 49:13.885
You did.

49:23.301 --> 49:26.759
Excuse me, sir.
I must go to the Queen.

49:26.838 --> 49:30.035
The man who was
hanged today...

49:30.107 --> 49:32.632
He was your cousin.

49:35.746 --> 49:37.543
Yes.

49:37.615 --> 49:39.583
I'm sorry.

49:46.424 --> 49:48.585
The last time
I saw him,

49:50.461 --> 49:52.361
he needed my help.

49:54.532 --> 49:56.227
I did nothing.

49:56.300 --> 49:57.995
What could
you have done?

49:59.437 --> 50:01.564
I don't know.

50:02.406 --> 50:04.806
Now he's dead.

50:04.876 --> 50:09.745
I keep seeing his face.
I keep seeing his eyes.

50:09.814 --> 50:13.011
Believe me, there's nothing that you
could have done that would have spared him.

50:13.084 --> 50:14.676
I'm so afraid.

50:14.752 --> 50:16.879
We're all human, Bess.

50:18.122 --> 50:20.818
We do what we can.

51:10.408 --> 51:13.468
<i>Your laundress was found to be
carrying letters in her washing.</i>

51:14.478 --> 51:16.469
Not her job, I think.

51:16.547 --> 51:18.777
How am I to send
my intimate letters?

51:18.849 --> 51:21.477
Through me.
And you will read them.

51:21.552 --> 51:24.521
With respectful
admiration.

51:24.622 --> 51:27.216
Am I to have
no privacy?

51:27.291 --> 51:28.315
No.

51:28.392 --> 51:30.019
You disappoint me, sir.

51:30.995 --> 51:33.589
The Queen orders these
measures for your protection.

51:33.664 --> 51:35.097
The Queen?

51:35.166 --> 51:37.225
I am a queen.

51:49.680 --> 51:52.376
They call her
the Virgin Queen.

51:53.818 --> 51:55.445
Why is that, sir?

51:56.721 --> 51:59.622
Can it be that no man
will have her?

53:32.983 --> 53:35.508
Let him
throw you round.

53:35.586 --> 53:38.350
Be bold. Come on,
you can trust him.

53:38.422 --> 53:40.253
And jump.

53:40.324 --> 53:43.816
When I bend like this, you
take a leap into the air.

53:45.196 --> 53:47.130
The Volta.

53:47.198 --> 53:49.632
I require all my ladies
to learn it.

53:50.568 --> 53:53.366
You see
how fearless Bess is?

53:53.437 --> 53:56.133
You like your ladies
to jump at your command.

53:56.240 --> 53:57.264
Do you think
that wrong?

53:57.341 --> 54:00.538
No. You are the Queen.
You are to be obeyed.

54:01.545 --> 54:03.843
To tell you
the truth,

54:03.914 --> 54:06.144
I'm very, very tired of
always being in control.

54:06.217 --> 54:08.208
Nonsense.

54:08.285 --> 54:10.583
What?

54:10.654 --> 54:14.454
You eat and
drink control.

54:14.525 --> 54:17.221
Is that so?

54:19.964 --> 54:21.295
Bess.

54:21.365 --> 54:23.663
You should try a dance
with Sir Walter.

54:23.734 --> 54:26.032
He's eager
to show us his skill.

54:26.103 --> 54:29.766
No skill at all, Majesty.
I don't know the steps.

54:29.840 --> 54:32.035
Come now.

54:37.615 --> 54:40.641
You stand
like this,

54:40.718 --> 54:44.210
with your hands here.

54:44.288 --> 54:45.846
And when she jumps,

54:45.923 --> 54:49.450
on the fifth step,

54:49.894 --> 54:52.192
you lift her.

54:52.263 --> 54:54.128
What could be simpler?

54:57.701 --> 55:00.499
Take your position,
Sir Walter.

55:02.306 --> 55:03.705
I am to be obeyed.

55:06.110 --> 55:08.340
As Your Majesty
wishes.

55:10.648 --> 55:13.879
Hold her firmly.
I don't want her dropped.

55:21.592 --> 55:23.560
Play.

55:23.694 --> 55:25.025
Six counts.

55:25.095 --> 55:28.360
One, two, three,
and lift, down.

56:05.169 --> 56:07.535
Leave us.

56:09.039 --> 56:11.337
I want both of them
left alone.

57:18.242 --> 57:19.675
Madam.

57:36.493 --> 57:38.222
I must reply.

57:40.397 --> 57:42.228
"If our forces
are in readiness,

57:42.299 --> 57:45.632
"both within and without
the realm,

57:45.703 --> 57:51.539
"then your Queen commands you
to set the gentlemen to work. "

57:51.608 --> 57:53.439
I think we have it.

58:00.584 --> 58:01.983
Yes.

58:07.558 --> 58:10.220
Let God's
work begin.

58:23.941 --> 58:24.999
Where have you been?

58:25.075 --> 58:27.703
I met up
with some old friends.

58:27.778 --> 58:30.076
From Paris, no doubt.

58:30.147 --> 58:32.081
We haven't
seen you for days.

58:32.149 --> 58:33.741
Yes.

58:33.817 --> 58:35.785
Now you're back.

58:40.758 --> 58:45.422
Do you know, I can still
remember the day you were born.

58:47.631 --> 58:50.566
I was 11 years old.

58:52.202 --> 58:55.933
And you,
this helpless bundle.

58:56.039 --> 58:57.904
I looked at you
in your crib,

58:57.975 --> 59:01.138
with your little,
wrinkled face,

59:01.211 --> 59:03.543
and I loved you
from the first.

59:05.682 --> 59:08.173
I've failed you,
haven't I?

59:09.286 --> 59:12.551
Forgive me if I haven't
loved you enough.

59:22.900 --> 59:25.926
Did you imagine
I wouldn't know?

59:31.942 --> 59:34.410
Your blessing,
Majesty. My little one.

59:34.478 --> 59:36.105
Your blessing?

59:45.255 --> 59:47.086
Walk on.

01:00:04.007 --> 01:00:06.805
The Queen is at her prayers.

01:00:15.953 --> 01:00:17.648
Go!

01:00:18.689 --> 01:00:23.183
Elizabeth is a whore! Mary
Stuart is our true queen!

01:00:25.295 --> 01:00:27.763
Elizabeth!

01:00:30.634 --> 01:00:32.761
Whore!

01:01:43.974 --> 01:01:45.635
You bring news?

01:01:50.147 --> 01:01:52.672
The Queen
has been attacked.

01:01:54.551 --> 01:01:57.247
The assassin seized.

01:02:02.292 --> 01:02:03.759
The Queen

01:02:05.896 --> 01:02:07.523
unharmed.

01:02:08.765 --> 01:02:09.789
Unharmed?

01:02:09.866 --> 01:02:15.099
And you, ma'am, are to
be tried for treason.

01:02:21.445 --> 01:02:23.345
Me?

01:02:25.382 --> 01:02:28.840
What has any of this
to do with me?

01:02:34.891 --> 01:02:38.019
That's the trouble
with intrigues, isn't it?

01:02:38.095 --> 01:02:39.255
With so many secrets,

01:02:39.329 --> 01:02:42.992
you can never quite be sure who's
on whose side till the game ends.

01:02:52.009 --> 01:02:55.445
Walsingham has every
letter you've written.

01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:02.050
Traitor.

01:03:08.558 --> 01:03:11.083
Traitors!

01:03:49.499 --> 01:03:51.967
Ready to die,
I see, Jesuit.

01:03:52.035 --> 01:03:54.401
I have done what
I was sent to do.

01:03:55.772 --> 01:03:58.206
Why was the gun
not loaded?

01:04:16.193 --> 01:04:19.026
I need your help.

01:04:22.866 --> 01:04:25.858
I, too,
have failed, brother.

01:04:26.670 --> 01:04:28.638
What was the Jesuit
sent to do?

01:04:28.705 --> 01:04:31.435
I told you everything I know.

01:04:32.509 --> 01:04:34.374
So kill me.

01:04:36.747 --> 01:04:39.511
There's a better world
waiting for me.

01:04:42.652 --> 01:04:45.485
We'll all be judged
in the end, brother.

01:04:46.923 --> 01:04:48.515
Even you.

01:04:49.326 --> 01:04:52.887
William, you're
not a martyr.

01:04:54.698 --> 01:04:57.166
You weren't even
much of a murderer.

01:05:01.838 --> 01:05:04.568
I'm going to have you
taken to France.

01:05:05.976 --> 01:05:08.444
No one will know.

01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:12.881
You must never let me
hear of you again.

01:05:16.553 --> 01:05:18.953
Francis.

01:05:19.022 --> 01:05:20.546
Francis!

01:05:20.624 --> 01:05:22.319
Francis.

01:05:24.628 --> 01:05:26.960
I've never seen her
so distressed.

01:05:27.030 --> 01:05:30.522
She's been alone in her room
since morning. She'll see no one.

01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:31.692
Has she asked for me?

01:05:31.768 --> 01:05:32.860
No.

01:05:32.936 --> 01:05:35.370
But she needs you.
I know she does.

01:05:37.174 --> 01:05:39.802
Go to her.

01:05:39.876 --> 01:05:42.538
Please.

01:06:01.031 --> 01:06:04.762
Are you here to tell me
I must murder a queen?

01:06:05.735 --> 01:06:09.102
I would never presume to
tell my Queen what to do.

01:06:09.239 --> 01:06:11.707
Only you know
where your duty lies.

01:06:15.512 --> 01:06:18.675
Was it my father's duty
to murder my mother?

01:06:19.983 --> 01:06:23.009
She was a queen
for a time.

01:06:24.254 --> 01:06:28.281
Oh, I would be loath to
die so bloody a death.

01:06:32.395 --> 01:06:35.296
Since when were you
so afraid?

01:06:38.835 --> 01:06:41.030
I'm always afraid.

01:06:43.206 --> 01:06:46.801
Kill a queen,
and all queens are mortal.

01:06:52.182 --> 01:06:55.242
We mortals have
many weaknesses.

01:06:55.318 --> 01:06:57.309
We feel too much.

01:06:57.387 --> 01:06:59.719
Hurt too much.

01:06:59.789 --> 01:07:02.758
All too soon we die.

01:07:03.727 --> 01:07:07.163
But we do have
the chance of love.

01:07:11.968 --> 01:07:13.936
Do we?

01:07:21.244 --> 01:07:24.372
I have given
England my life.

01:07:25.415 --> 01:07:28.543
Must she also
have my soul?

01:07:28.952 --> 01:07:31.079
<i>Mary Stuart must die!</i>

01:07:31.254 --> 01:07:34.655
Must? Mary Stuart must die?

01:07:34.724 --> 01:07:37.989
Where is it written? Who
says so? Have I ordered it?

01:07:38.061 --> 01:07:40.689
Majesty, this is
no time for mercy.

01:07:40.764 --> 01:07:43.130
Don't preach at me,
old man!

01:07:44.334 --> 01:07:47.098
Look at you.
You can hardly stand.

01:07:49.072 --> 01:07:52.098
Go home to your wife
and your bed.

01:07:53.476 --> 01:07:56.673
The law must
have its way.

01:07:58.982 --> 01:08:02.474
By whose authority
do you condemn me?

01:08:03.453 --> 01:08:05.512
God is my only judge.

01:08:06.256 --> 01:08:10.625
The law is for common
men. Not for princes.

01:08:11.695 --> 01:08:16.564
The law, Your Majesty, is for
the protection of your people.

01:08:24.741 --> 01:08:26.572
Leave me.

01:08:31.081 --> 01:08:33.743
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.

01:08:40.991 --> 01:08:46.691
<i>You know neither who
you are or what you do.</i>

01:08:48.298 --> 01:08:51.095
I know who I am.

01:08:51.167 --> 01:08:55.729
And if I die, it shall
be as I have lived.

01:08:58.241 --> 01:09:00.765
As a queen,

01:09:00.844 --> 01:09:06.009
trusting in the mercy
of God, my Father.

01:09:09.669 --> 01:09:12.777
They have letters in Mary Stuart's own hand.

01:09:14.992 --> 01:09:17.889
All of England cries out for her death.

01:09:46.956 --> 01:09:49.287
At which hour?

01:09:49.359 --> 01:09:50.383
At 8:00.

01:09:52.429 --> 01:09:54.590
Tomorrow morning.

01:11:00.063 --> 01:11:01.928
It must be stopped!

01:11:03.466 --> 01:11:05.525
I want it stopped!

01:12:02.692 --> 01:12:06.128
I forgive you
with all my heart.

01:13:24.917 --> 01:13:27.675
A sweet Christian lady...

01:13:28.043 --> 01:13:32.194
slain by a Godless, childless bastard.

01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:34.554
Blood...

01:13:34.616 --> 01:13:37.854
must pay for blood.

01:13:40.492 --> 01:13:41.871
Elizabeth...

01:13:43.681 --> 01:13:45.395
bastard.

01:13:51.997 --> 01:13:57.160
I call the legions of Christ to war!

01:14:02.151 --> 01:14:04.592
Blood-soaked virgin.

01:14:07.174 --> 01:14:09.028
She will pay...

01:14:10.321 --> 01:14:11.641
with her country,

01:14:11.642 --> 01:14:13.887
her throne...

01:14:14.819 --> 01:14:15.978
and her life!

01:14:19.529 --> 01:14:21.759
<i>Forgive me, Majesty.</i>

01:14:23.766 --> 01:14:26.360
I have failed you.

01:14:26.502 --> 01:14:29.471
How have you failed me?

01:14:29.906 --> 01:14:31.840
What am I
to forgive you for?

01:14:31.908 --> 01:14:33.876
Philip of Spain
is a God-fearing man

01:14:33.943 --> 01:14:36.878
who cannot declare war
without a just cause.

01:14:38.915 --> 01:14:42.544
I intercepted every letter
Mary Stuart secretly dispatched,

01:14:44.053 --> 01:14:48.285
but failed to see that Spain
knew I was reading them.

01:14:50.026 --> 01:14:51.960
They waited for her
to write the words

01:14:52.028 --> 01:14:55.520
that would, in my eyes,
confirm her treason.

01:14:57.233 --> 01:14:59.497
Forgive me.

01:14:59.569 --> 01:15:02.367
I am trapped
in my own web.

01:15:04.874 --> 01:15:08.332
And I ordered
Mary's execution.

01:15:10.146 --> 01:15:14.139
I murdered God's
anointed Queen.

01:15:15.885 --> 01:15:21.653
And now God's most dutiful son
makes holy war to punish me.

01:15:54.290 --> 01:15:56.554
We are at war.

01:15:56.626 --> 01:15:59.857
Who knows when
we will meet again?

01:16:00.196 --> 01:16:02.687
If we will meet again.

01:16:04.233 --> 01:16:09.364
If England falls, my last days
will be in a Spanish prison.

01:16:10.673 --> 01:16:13.267
To die far from home.

01:16:13.342 --> 01:16:15.003
That is the
loneliest death.

01:16:15.077 --> 01:16:16.738
Never.

01:16:18.781 --> 01:16:21.341
My thoughts
turn dark.

01:16:25.521 --> 01:16:27.546
What do you do
in a storm

01:16:27.623 --> 01:16:29.523
when you're facing
your death?

01:16:30.993 --> 01:16:33.484
The closer
I come to death,

01:16:33.596 --> 01:16:35.689
the more
I want to live,

01:16:35.765 --> 01:16:38.199
the hungrier
I am for life.

01:16:38.267 --> 01:16:42.670
Yes. To live
right to the end.

01:16:42.738 --> 01:16:45.332
Why be afraid of tomorrow
when today is all we have?

01:16:45.408 --> 01:16:47.273
I wish...

01:16:49.178 --> 01:16:52.443
I have never known
a woman like you.

01:16:55.818 --> 01:16:59.914
In some other world,
in some other time,

01:17:02.124 --> 01:17:05.025
could you have
loved me?

01:17:06.062 --> 01:17:08.895
I know only
one world.

01:17:09.866 --> 01:17:13.666
And in this world,
I have loved you.

01:17:20.776 --> 01:17:24.439
There's something
you could do for me,

01:17:26.048 --> 01:17:31.350
something I have not
known for a very long time.

01:17:33.990 --> 01:17:37.050
If you felt
so inclined.

01:17:37.793 --> 01:17:41.695
But it's not to be
spoken of afterward.

01:17:42.999 --> 01:17:45.968
It must be forgotten.

01:17:47.670 --> 01:17:50.104
But just for now...

01:17:53.376 --> 01:17:55.071
A kiss?

01:18:30.112 --> 01:18:31.602
I die.

01:18:54.537 --> 01:18:55.561
I've given
Drake the orders

01:18:55.638 --> 01:18:57.265
to prepare the fleet
to defend the Channel.

01:18:57.340 --> 01:18:58.705
How soon can you
join him?

01:18:58.774 --> 01:19:01.641
We're waiting for supplies. We can
move as soon as we're ready and armed.

01:19:01.711 --> 01:19:02.837
Good.

01:19:06.882 --> 01:19:08.281
Bess.

01:19:08.985 --> 01:19:11.283
I have something
to tell you.

01:19:11.887 --> 01:19:15.118
I ask for nothing.
Is that understood?

01:19:16.926 --> 01:19:19.588
Your life is your own.
Nothing will change.

01:19:19.662 --> 01:19:21.357
What is this?

01:19:24.533 --> 01:19:26.763
I am...
You're with child.

01:19:27.570 --> 01:19:30.937
No one knows.
My plans are made.

01:19:31.007 --> 01:19:33.771
I shall ask the Queen for
permission to leave court.

01:19:33.843 --> 01:19:34.935
Where will you go?

01:19:35.011 --> 01:19:37.241
To my
mother's house.

01:19:37.313 --> 01:19:39.975
I'm a ward of the Queen. I can't
court a man without her permission.

01:19:40.049 --> 01:19:42.142
I can't marry
without her permission.

01:19:42.218 --> 01:19:45.051
As for having a child,

01:19:45.921 --> 01:19:47.548
your child...

01:19:49.325 --> 01:19:53.227
All I know
is nothing's as it should be.

01:19:53.295 --> 01:19:55.024
Please, listen.

01:19:55.131 --> 01:19:58.328
You once said to me, "Whatever I
have to give, ask and it's yours. "

01:19:58.401 --> 01:19:59.390
Do you remember?

01:19:59.468 --> 01:20:00.958
Of course, I remember.

01:20:01.037 --> 01:20:02.937
I ask that you
forget me.

01:20:03.005 --> 01:20:06.532
Go to your ship.
Do your duty.

01:20:06.609 --> 01:20:08.975
Forget me.
Bess!

01:20:09.078 --> 01:20:11.478
We're summoned.
Coming.

01:20:19.989 --> 01:20:25.689
This Spanish Armada is at sea
with an army of 10,000 men?

01:20:25.761 --> 01:20:28.286
And Philip's friend,
the Duke of Parma,

01:20:28.364 --> 01:20:31.697
has 15,000 men
on the French coast.

01:20:32.802 --> 01:20:36.602
They plan to cross the Channel in
barges and sail into the Thames.

01:20:36.672 --> 01:20:39.300
They don't have enough barges
yet. We have a little time.

01:20:39.375 --> 01:20:44.335
And our forces defend the mouth
of the Thames at Tilbury with...

01:20:44.413 --> 01:20:48.440
What? How...
Four thousand men?

01:20:48.951 --> 01:20:52.352
Three thousand.
Possibly.

01:20:52.421 --> 01:20:54.821
If the Spanish fleet
unites the barges,

01:20:54.890 --> 01:20:57.358
their combined strength
will overwhelm us.

01:20:58.627 --> 01:21:01.562
Then we shall
engage them at sea,

01:21:01.630 --> 01:21:03.860
before they have
the chance to unite.

01:21:04.300 --> 01:21:05.733
Your Majesty,

01:21:05.801 --> 01:21:10.329
this vast Armada will surely
smash through our naval defenses

01:21:10.406 --> 01:21:11.998
and overrun
us on land.

01:21:13.442 --> 01:21:16.411
We must prepare
for the worst.

01:21:56.452 --> 01:21:58.682
I need air.

01:21:59.955 --> 01:22:01.889
<i>With this ring,
I thee wed.</i>

01:22:01.957 --> 01:22:04.653
<i>With this ring,
I thee wed.</i>

01:22:04.727 --> 01:22:11.264
<i>With my body,
I thee worship.</i>

01:22:11.333 --> 01:22:14.598
And with all my worldly
goods, I thee endow.

01:22:14.670 --> 01:22:18.436
And with all my worldly
goods, I thee endow.

01:22:18.507 --> 01:22:21.340
In the name
of the Father

01:22:21.410 --> 01:22:27.110
and of the Son, and of
the Holy Ghost, amen.

01:22:32.087 --> 01:22:34.749
Bess!

01:22:37.059 --> 01:22:39.550
Bess!

01:22:39.628 --> 01:22:42.688
Bess Throckmorton!

01:22:47.670 --> 01:22:49.433
Here, my lady.

01:22:49.505 --> 01:22:51.939
Tell me,
is it true?

01:22:52.007 --> 01:22:54.771
Are you with child?

01:22:55.644 --> 01:22:57.578
Are you with child?

01:22:57.813 --> 01:23:00.407
Yes, my lady.

01:23:00.482 --> 01:23:02.950
You traitress.

01:23:03.018 --> 01:23:05.452
You dare to keep
secrets from me?

01:23:05.521 --> 01:23:08.388
You ask my permission
before you rut!

01:23:08.457 --> 01:23:09.651
Before you breed!

01:23:09.725 --> 01:23:12.956
My bitches wear my
collars! Do you hear me?

01:23:13.028 --> 01:23:14.393
Do you hear me?

01:23:14.463 --> 01:23:17.591
Majesty! Please,
dignity. Mercy.

01:23:17.666 --> 01:23:19.964
This is no time
for mercy, Walsingham.

01:23:20.035 --> 01:23:21.263
You go to your
traitor brother

01:23:21.337 --> 01:23:23.635
and leave me
to my business.

01:23:23.706 --> 01:23:25.697
Is it his?

01:23:25.774 --> 01:23:29.301
Tell me. Say it. Is the
child his? Is it his?

01:23:29.378 --> 01:23:31.369
Yes.

01:23:31.447 --> 01:23:36.544
My lady, it is
my husband's child.

01:23:39.154 --> 01:23:40.678
You bitch!

01:23:40.756 --> 01:23:42.383
Majesty.

01:23:43.425 --> 01:23:46.826
This is not the Queen
I love and serve.

01:23:52.501 --> 01:23:55.436
This man has seduced
a ward of the Queen.

01:23:55.504 --> 01:23:59.133
And she has married
without royal consent.

01:23:59.208 --> 01:24:03.235
These offenses are
punishable by law. Arrest him!

01:24:03.312 --> 01:24:05.280
Go!

01:24:09.985 --> 01:24:13.512
You no longer have
the Queen's protection.

01:24:13.589 --> 01:24:16.251
As you wish,
Majesty.

01:24:16.325 --> 01:24:17.690
Get out.

01:24:17.793 --> 01:24:20.728
Get out! Get out!

01:24:24.266 --> 01:24:27.258
Get out!

01:24:51.060 --> 01:24:54.962
The fall of an empire,
you told me.

01:24:55.030 --> 01:24:56.657
Did you mean
the English empire?

01:24:56.732 --> 01:24:59.963
Because, by God, England will
not fall while I am Queen.

01:25:00.035 --> 01:25:02.503
If that is your prophecy,
sir, you prophesy again.

01:25:02.571 --> 01:25:04.061
You want me to tell
Your Majesty

01:25:04.139 --> 01:25:05.936
only what Your Majesty
chooses to hear.

01:25:06.008 --> 01:25:08.306
I will not be a toy
of the fates!

01:25:08.377 --> 01:25:11.175
Have I not faced an
assassin's bullet and lived?

01:25:13.983 --> 01:25:18.079
Just tell me
there's no certainty.

01:25:19.421 --> 01:25:20.786
That any outcome
is possible.

01:25:20.856 --> 01:25:24.087
The shadow of ghosts,
you said.

01:25:24.326 --> 01:25:28.194
Please, just
give me hope.

01:25:28.263 --> 01:25:31.892
The forces that shape our world
are greater than all of us, Majesty.

01:25:31.967 --> 01:25:35.596
How can I promise that
they'll conspire in your favor,

01:25:35.671 --> 01:25:37.866
even though
you are the Queen?

01:25:40.743 --> 01:25:43.473
But this much
I know.

01:25:43.545 --> 01:25:49.506
When the storm breaks, each man acts
in accordance with his own nature.

01:25:49.585 --> 01:25:52.110
Some are dumb
with terror.

01:25:52.187 --> 01:25:55.486
Some flee. Some hide.

01:25:55.557 --> 01:25:58.390
And some

01:25:58.460 --> 01:26:03.022
spread their wings like
eagles and soar on the wind.

01:26:10.472 --> 01:26:13.805
You are a wise man,
Dr. Dee.

01:26:13.876 --> 01:26:17.073
And you, madam,
are a very great lady.

01:26:23.552 --> 01:26:26.112
Light the beacon!

01:27:17.739 --> 01:27:19.730
My lords,

01:27:20.809 --> 01:27:24.108
I can offer you
no words of comfort.

01:27:25.681 --> 01:27:28.980
This Armada
that sails against us,

01:27:29.051 --> 01:27:32.487
carries in its bowels
the Inquisition.

01:27:32.554 --> 01:27:35.079
God forbid it succeeds,

01:27:35.157 --> 01:27:38.615
for then there will be
no more liberty in England

01:27:38.694 --> 01:27:41.356
of conscience or of thought.

01:27:43.999 --> 01:27:46.968
We cannot be defeated.

01:27:48.103 --> 01:27:50.833
The bells are to ring
from every tower.

01:27:50.906 --> 01:27:54.899
Laborers are to leave the
fields, and take up arms.

01:27:54.977 --> 01:27:57.036
The harvest must wait.

01:27:58.447 --> 01:28:02.713
All prisoners
are to be released.

01:28:03.619 --> 01:28:06.019
England is their country, too.

01:28:22.871 --> 01:28:25.999
And release Raleigh.

01:28:29.545 --> 01:28:32.070
He is forgiven.

01:28:34.950 --> 01:28:37.282
As I, too,
long to be forgiven.

01:28:44.826 --> 01:28:48.387
Let the fleet know we're
on our way, Mr. Calley!

01:28:49.364 --> 01:28:52.128
Fire broadside
from the bow!

01:28:53.368 --> 01:28:55.427
Run out the prime!

01:28:55.771 --> 01:28:59.138
From the starboard bow,
number one gun!

01:28:59.208 --> 01:29:01.802
On my mark!

01:29:01.877 --> 01:29:03.936
Discharge! Two!

01:29:04.012 --> 01:29:07.379
Three! Four!

01:29:32.474 --> 01:29:36.035
Majesty, the enemy
has been engaged.

01:29:37.546 --> 01:29:38.535
What news?

01:29:38.614 --> 01:29:41.845
A brave action,
Your Majesty.

01:29:41.917 --> 01:29:43.851
Two ships lost.

01:29:43.919 --> 01:29:45.580
With what gain?

01:29:45.654 --> 01:29:48.179
The enemy continue
to advance.

01:29:56.231 --> 01:29:59.428
Tighten the buntlines
on the foresail!

01:30:00.535 --> 01:30:02.696
Another four
ships lost.

01:30:02.838 --> 01:30:06.296
We must continue to engage
and harass the enemy.

01:30:07.376 --> 01:30:11.244
We're outgunned,
Drake. Decisively.

01:30:12.581 --> 01:30:17.041
We're losing too many ships. We
must fall back and defend the coast.

01:30:19.288 --> 01:30:20.550
If the wind
is with us, Walter,

01:30:20.622 --> 01:30:22.590
we can attack them
with fire ships.

01:30:22.658 --> 01:30:25.593
Six fire ships
into the Spanish formation,

01:30:25.661 --> 01:30:27.492
that may force
them to scatter.

01:30:27.562 --> 01:30:29.257
We can't get
anywhere near them.

01:30:29.331 --> 01:30:32.596
We have to break their
formation. That's our only chance.

01:30:35.771 --> 01:30:38.296
The Spanish are barely
a day away, Majesty.

01:30:38.373 --> 01:30:41.035
We must withdraw
to safe ground.

01:30:41.109 --> 01:30:46.638
I beg you to appreciate the gravity of
the situation. There is very little time.

01:31:22.918 --> 01:31:26.012
My loving people.

01:31:28.590 --> 01:31:31.423
We see the sails
of the enemy approaching.

01:31:32.761 --> 01:31:36.458
We hear the Spanish guns
over the water.

01:31:38.166 --> 01:31:43.661
Soon now, we will
meet them face to face.

01:31:46.141 --> 01:31:49.167
I am resolved in the midst
and heat of the battle

01:31:49.244 --> 01:31:52.907
to live or die
amongst you all!

01:31:56.985 --> 01:32:02.389
While we stand together,
no invader shall pass.

01:32:02.457 --> 01:32:06.325
Let them come with the armies
of hell! They will not pass!

01:32:08.897 --> 01:32:12.458
And when this day
of battle is ended,

01:32:13.802 --> 01:32:16.270
we meet again in heaven

01:32:17.906 --> 01:32:21.569
or on the field of victory.

01:33:05.420 --> 01:33:08.480
Thomas! Get up!
Get up, man! Get up!

01:33:16.198 --> 01:33:19.497
Help me!
Somebody, help me!

01:33:19.568 --> 01:33:21.536
Help me!

01:33:32.704 --> 01:33:35.120
We'll be driven onto the rocks.

01:33:35.643 --> 01:33:37.059
Drop anchor.

01:33:37.732 --> 01:33:40.903
Our orders are to proceed
with all haste.

01:33:41.177 --> 01:33:44.288
If we don't drop anchor
we will break formation.

01:33:45.852 --> 01:33:47.343
Drop anchor!

01:33:47.619 --> 01:33:48.676
Hurry.

01:33:52.249 --> 01:33:54.026
Hurry!
Let's go!

01:33:58.020 --> 01:34:00.068
Drop anchor!

01:34:05.981 --> 01:34:07.676
They've dropped anchor.

01:34:07.749 --> 01:34:10.877
These Spanish monsters can't
handle our English seas.

01:34:11.753 --> 01:34:14.916
We have the wind
in our favor.

01:34:14.990 --> 01:34:16.617
Do we go?

01:34:19.227 --> 01:34:21.195
We go.

01:34:21.696 --> 01:34:23.789
Godspeed, my friend.

01:34:26.034 --> 01:34:27.763
Walter?

01:34:27.836 --> 01:34:29.701
Don't forget to jump.

01:34:45.654 --> 01:34:47.349
Calley!

01:34:47.455 --> 01:34:50.083
Enough tar!
Clear the deck!

01:34:51.159 --> 01:34:53.957
If that cannon's primed,
set the fuse!

01:34:56.665 --> 01:35:00.499
Get everybody
off the ship, now!

01:35:05.373 --> 01:35:07.466
Get off the ship! Off the ship! Go!

01:35:07.542 --> 01:35:09.840
Get over there!

01:35:09.911 --> 01:35:12.505
Come on, boys!
Get going!

01:35:37.780 --> 01:35:39.431
Fire ships!

01:35:39.819 --> 01:35:41.798
Fire ships!

01:35:44.126 --> 01:35:45.879
Raise the anchors!

01:35:49.014 --> 01:35:50.382
Raise the anchors.

01:35:50.479 --> 01:35:52.384
Hurry!

01:35:57.266 --> 01:35:58.691
Load the cannons.

01:35:58.692 --> 01:35:59.692
Cut the rope!

01:36:09.037 --> 01:36:11.005
The Spanish
continue to advance.

01:36:11.072 --> 01:36:13.506
Just five of their ships
are burning.

01:36:17.646 --> 01:36:19.910
Not enough.

01:38:06.344 --> 01:38:08.634
Elizabeth is darkness,

01:38:09.299 --> 01:38:10.770
I am light.

01:40:24.878 --> 01:40:29.148
Oh God Almighty calm your wrath.

01:40:30.364 --> 01:40:33.517
Your mighty wind
has humbled our pride.

01:40:33.749 --> 01:40:36.470
Our ships have been destroyed.

01:40:37.930 --> 01:40:41.158
Our armies have perished.

01:40:41.414 --> 01:40:43.888
This is your will, Lord.

01:40:44.846 --> 01:40:47.110
Amen.

01:41:50.812 --> 01:41:53.337
Francis?

01:42:12.233 --> 01:42:17.330
I have served Your Majesty
in all things.

01:42:19.173 --> 01:42:21.266
I know it.

01:42:23.644 --> 01:42:26.477
You won't need me anymore.

01:42:40.061 --> 01:42:42.052
You rest here,

01:42:46.334 --> 01:42:48.199
old friend.

01:43:27.108 --> 01:43:29.941
Elizabeth has a son.

01:43:32.013 --> 01:43:34.709
You must be proud.

01:43:34.782 --> 01:43:36.682
Very.

01:43:36.751 --> 01:43:39.311
And fulfilled.

01:43:39.387 --> 01:43:41.981
As any man can be.

01:43:43.257 --> 01:43:47.785
Do you still dream of your
shining city in the New World?

01:43:49.063 --> 01:43:50.928
Always.

01:44:14.055 --> 01:44:17.149
I'd like to give
your son my blessing.

01:44:18.426 --> 01:44:20.417
I'd be honored.

01:45:23.191 --> 01:45:26.251
<i>I am called
the Virgin Queen.</i>

01:45:27.828 --> 01:45:30.023
<i>Unmarried,</i>

01:45:30.097 --> 01:45:32.691
<i>I have no master.</i>

01:45:33.868 --> 01:45:36.234
<i>Childless,</i>

01:45:36.337 --> 01:45:40.068
<i>I am mother to my people.</i>

01:45:40.708 --> 01:45:46.078
<i>God give me strength
to bear this mighty freedom.</i>

01:45:48.849 --> 01:45:51.682
<i>I am your Queen.</i>

01:45:53.254 --> 01:45:56.052
<i>I am myself.</i>

01:46:03.764 --> 01:46:09.699
The loss of the Armada was the most
humiliating defeat in Spain's naval history.

01:46:11.372 --> 01:46:15.968
Philip died ten years later
leaving Spain bankrupt.

01:46:17.778 --> 01:46:23.216
England entered a time
of peace and prosperity.
