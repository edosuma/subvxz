WEBVTT

00:05.224 --> 00:09.619
You and I are going to out Don Kaplan.

00:09.625 --> 00:12.950
And that will be the
basis for my exoneration.

00:12.958 --> 00:16.328
- And what do you think of Sonia Stevens?
- Sonia's an angel.

00:16.334 --> 00:18.273
Sonia always knew I was Witness X

00:18.279 --> 00:22.129
'cause she planned the whole thing,
right? Now I'm so afraid, Kaz.

00:22.152 --> 00:23.752
I think I'm losing my mind.

00:23.809 --> 00:27.037
After everything you have done
for me, I'll always have your back.

00:27.043 --> 00:29.294
- Not this time.
- What the hell was that about?

00:29.419 --> 00:30.830
I didn't tell her anything.

00:30.955 --> 00:32.862
I haven't got my ticket or nothin'.

00:32.897 --> 00:36.193
- Study hard and you will pass the test.
- What is this shit?

00:36.199 --> 00:38.821
"Sonia Stevens with
intellectually disabled

00:38.838 --> 00:40.674
- Susan Boomer Jenkins."
- Fuck off.

00:40.715 --> 00:43.260
Dominic, hi. It's Marie Winter.

00:43.385 --> 00:46.363
That number you gave
us, Dominic Pasquale,

00:46.675 --> 00:49.020
we put a watch out on
him and it came up trumps.

00:49.060 --> 00:52.298
- What happened?
- It was a set up, everyone's busted.

00:52.300 --> 00:54.140
We've got a fucking rat.

00:54.348 --> 00:57.824
We want you to get this
into Winter's phone,

00:57.871 --> 01:00.146
that way we can monitor it 24/7.

01:00.157 --> 01:01.699

01:51.406 --> 01:53.601
Now, Dragovic, what's her story?

01:53.624 --> 01:55.506
She does Marie Winter's dirty work.

01:55.529 --> 01:57.763
She takes care of the
seedy end of the business,

01:57.774 --> 02:01.338
- so Winter can keep her nose clean.
- Any background on her?

02:01.396 --> 02:05.893
Serbian, tortured during the
war in Bosnia and left for dead.

02:06.129 --> 02:09.963
And then she turned up again doing
jail time in Serbia for war crimes.

02:09.979 --> 02:12.660
And now she's in here? Great!

02:12.785 --> 02:14.445
You've just made my day.

02:14.694 --> 02:16.531
- We done?
- Almost.

02:17.546 --> 02:19.444
We hear that Ray's been to visit.

02:20.133 --> 02:21.401
He misses me.

02:22.818 --> 02:24.448
That's the job, isn't it?

02:25.590 --> 02:27.074
You've done well, Detective.

02:27.080 --> 02:29.300
Just remember if there's
anything else you need,

02:29.306 --> 02:30.799
we're just a phone call away.

02:37.341 --> 02:40.109
OK, Connors, week's up. Let's go.

02:42.688 --> 02:43.991
Let's get some brekkie into ya

02:43.997 --> 02:45.640
and then we'll have
a quick study session.

02:46.187 --> 02:49.171
What's the point? I'm
intellectually disabled.

02:49.545 --> 02:52.125
Um, hello! You've got a test tomorrow.

02:52.131 --> 02:54.060
- Hm!
- You can lead a horse to water...

02:54.332 --> 02:55.532
Hey.

02:56.416 --> 02:59.099
- What are you doin' about Sonia?
- I'm workin' on it.

02:59.275 --> 03:00.721
What's to work on?

03:00.763 --> 03:03.503
- She killed Sharon.
- I said I'm working on it.

03:03.601 --> 03:05.963
Now, have you seen the doctor yet?

03:05.969 --> 03:08.165
No. I'm just stressed!

03:08.178 --> 03:10.500
And you would be too if you'd
been through what I have.

03:11.644 --> 03:13.473
All right, you know
what? Maybe I'm wrong.

03:13.533 --> 03:17.210
Forget the doctor. And
just deal with Sonia, yeah?

03:22.421 --> 03:23.784
Can I help you?

03:23.843 --> 03:26.538
Take your stuff and go tell
the screws you wanna move.

03:26.544 --> 03:27.744
I want your cell.

03:27.750 --> 03:30.477
No chance, it's got ocean
views and an en-suite.

03:33.181 --> 03:34.687
Marie doesn't need you any more.

03:34.693 --> 03:37.565
Marie wants me to move,
Marie can tell me herself.

03:37.731 --> 03:39.974
Oh, I see you two have met.

03:40.496 --> 03:42.220
Give us a minute, will you, darling.

03:49.639 --> 03:52.213
- Where'd you find Dracula?
- That's Zara,

03:52.219 --> 03:53.973
she's a business associate.

03:53.979 --> 03:56.183
She arrived when you were in the slot.

03:57.045 --> 03:58.948
Now I would like you to get along.

03:59.600 --> 04:02.103
She seriously needs
an attitude adjustment.

04:02.136 --> 04:04.695
She can be prickly,
but she's very loyal.

04:05.054 --> 04:08.318
- And I like that.
- Fair enough, but I'm not movin'.

04:08.752 --> 04:10.735
Oh, that's OK. I'll talk to her.

04:10.996 --> 04:13.800
Between you and me, I
prefer she stay in H5.

04:13.806 --> 04:15.686
Why? She got the hots for you?

04:15.749 --> 04:19.606
Let's just to say a little
bit of Zara goes a long way.

04:20.586 --> 04:22.564
What happened with Kosta and her crew?

04:22.570 --> 04:24.851
She had a problem with
you bringing in drugs,

04:24.961 --> 04:27.095
I convinced her to let it slide.

04:27.156 --> 04:28.399
Thanks, Rita.

04:29.424 --> 04:33.069
I think that's the second
time you've saved my arse.

04:33.351 --> 04:34.931
I aim to please.

04:36.000 --> 04:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:43.421 --> 04:45.151
Well, at least it makes a change

04:45.157 --> 04:47.301
not seeing Ferguson on the front page.

04:50.044 --> 04:51.393
You OK?

04:51.732 --> 04:52.934
I'm fine.

04:53.575 --> 04:54.870
Ms Bennett!

04:56.719 --> 04:58.572
How can I help you, Stevens?

04:58.578 --> 05:01.051
Congratulations on your media strategy.

05:01.057 --> 05:04.060
I think we take rather
a good photo, don't you?

05:04.448 --> 05:05.790
Ms Bennett!

05:07.566 --> 05:11.692
My publicist has another
opportunity to promote Wentworth.

05:11.701 --> 05:13.835
- Really?
- Marshall Adams.

05:13.858 --> 05:15.221
The shock jock?

05:15.227 --> 05:18.841
Huge audience and he's
very big on prison reform

05:18.847 --> 05:20.245
and tackling recidivism.

05:20.251 --> 05:21.757
He saw the angel article

05:21.763 --> 05:23.451
and he wants to do an
interview on the workshop.

05:23.457 --> 05:25.337
I have no desire to
be ridiculed on radio.

05:25.343 --> 05:26.677
Oh, no, don't... don't...
don't worry about that.

05:26.683 --> 05:28.473
My publicist and he go way back.

05:28.479 --> 05:32.917
She has guaranteed that we
will control the narrative.

05:33.707 --> 05:37.075
All right, get me the details and
I will run it by media liaison.

05:42.566 --> 05:47.074
You and me together on the
radio talking about the workshop.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.780
I just don't think it's a good idea.

05:48.786 --> 05:50.758
Oh, nonsense. It's all
arranged for tomorrow.

05:50.764 --> 05:52.586
No, I just get way too anxious.

05:52.592 --> 05:54.611
Well, I will be there with you.

05:54.617 --> 05:56.927
We are in this together, remember?

05:56.933 --> 05:59.594
Now I've gone to a lot of
trouble to convince Ms Bennett,

05:59.600 --> 06:02.717
so if she asks, just tell
her how excited you are. Hm?

06:02.723 --> 06:05.385
Haven't you heard, Sonia? No means no.

06:05.491 --> 06:06.691
Why don't you ask Boomer?

06:06.697 --> 06:10.714
- Yes! Boomer'd be great.
- Nah, nah, too dumb for the radio.

06:10.720 --> 06:13.501
Don't take it personally.
It's not like that.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.910
- What's it like Sonia?
- It's just that they want to interview

06:15.916 --> 06:18.943
- an ordinary prisoner. Liz is perfect.
- Perfect!

06:19.049 --> 06:21.253
Yeah, just fuckin' perfect!

06:22.645 --> 06:24.842
I'm your partner, not her!

06:24.874 --> 06:27.277
Why did you pick Liz when you know

06:27.283 --> 06:30.528
- she's the one who...
- Now, Susan! You're being petulant.

06:30.840 --> 06:34.915
Whatever the fuck that means!
I'm fuckin' thick, remember!

06:36.742 --> 06:38.003
Jenkins.

06:38.474 --> 06:39.674
Get out.

06:41.352 --> 06:44.785
- I haven't had me pancakes yet.
- I said get out!

06:58.944 --> 07:02.039
Hey, what's the story over
there with Marie and Drago?

07:02.164 --> 07:04.737
No idea, after my time.

07:10.839 --> 07:12.039
Fuck!

07:12.045 --> 07:13.245
Hey!

07:14.235 --> 07:16.535
- Just...
- Boomer, settle down!

07:22.495 --> 07:24.298
You're just hurting yourself.

07:24.304 --> 07:28.685
- She's supposed to be my fucking partner!
- I know.

07:28.691 --> 07:32.140
And now all of a sudden, she
just thinks I'm a dumb-arse,

07:32.265 --> 07:34.437
just like everyone else does.

07:35.139 --> 07:37.803
Sonia reckons she is way
too smart for all of us.

07:37.809 --> 07:39.009
Yeah!

07:39.317 --> 07:42.030
Yeah. Well, she... she
ain't that smart, is she?

07:42.036 --> 07:45.031
Know, it should be me doing
the radio interview not Liz.

07:45.037 --> 07:47.736
You know, I never believed
her fuckin' suicide bullshit.

07:47.742 --> 07:50.761
- No. She... What?
- Sonia just said that to get you off the hook.

07:50.767 --> 07:53.126
Oh, uh, no, 'cause,
well it wasn't to me...

07:53.132 --> 07:55.343
At breakfast you said,
"Liz was the one who... "

07:55.349 --> 07:57.950
before she cut you off.
Liz was the one who what?

07:58.430 --> 08:01.852
- Uh, can't remember 'cause I went bunta...
- You are a shit liar, Boomer.

08:01.858 --> 08:03.865
- What'd Liz do to Sonia?
- Nothin'.

08:03.871 --> 08:05.978
She poisoned her, didn't she.

08:06.024 --> 08:07.579
Oh, um...

08:07.585 --> 08:10.569
Why would she do that?
What was she afraid of?

08:11.850 --> 08:14.125
- I don't know, you gotta ask Sonia.
- Boomer, tell me.

08:14.131 --> 08:16.847
- I can't 'cause I promised.
- Was Liz Witness X?

08:20.100 --> 08:21.440
Yeah.

08:24.373 --> 08:26.388
- Hey, mate.
- What?!

08:26.394 --> 08:27.723
You still not sleeping?

08:28.107 --> 08:31.192
Took tablets last night, still
can't sleep a fucking wink!

08:33.313 --> 08:35.114
- I need a favour.
- What?

08:35.120 --> 08:36.717
I've been having trouble sleeping.

08:36.735 --> 08:38.943
I tried some herbal stuff,
but it's just not really...

08:38.948 --> 08:40.760
First sign of a guilty conscience.

08:40.765 --> 08:42.073
You got anything stronger?

08:42.400 --> 08:43.856
Go to the chemist.

08:44.766 --> 08:46.716
I'm on late shift.

08:46.722 --> 08:49.188
- Been pulling doubles to help out Will.
- Hm.

08:49.862 --> 08:52.221
I would've called, but it's
just... it's been a crazy week.

08:52.227 --> 08:54.287
- Mm, bullshit.
- Seriously.

08:54.730 --> 08:57.234
Maybe we can have a meal this weekend.

08:57.359 --> 08:58.860
I'll check my schedule...

09:04.206 --> 09:06.011
These ones are the best,

09:06.017 --> 09:07.980
take two, 20 minutes before bed.

09:08.025 --> 09:09.621
And, uh...

09:10.119 --> 09:12.307
maybe a little somethin'
to spark me up at work?

09:17.254 --> 09:19.414
These blue ones are uppers.

09:19.420 --> 09:21.608
So no more than two at a time.

09:21.620 --> 09:24.628
Just remember that white
is stop and blue is go.

09:24.634 --> 09:26.334
Got it. I owe ya.

09:37.597 --> 09:40.795
Well, I guess you're not keen
for a study session then, 'ey?

09:41.382 --> 09:43.112
I'm not doin' the test.

09:43.847 --> 09:46.436
Boomer, you can't let
that stupid reporter

09:46.442 --> 09:48.846
- stop you from getting what you want.
- No, it's not the reporter...

09:49.026 --> 09:50.266
it's me.

09:52.126 --> 09:55.001
It's true, I am a dumb fuck.

09:55.298 --> 09:58.136
- That's not true.
- No, it is. It is.

09:59.861 --> 10:01.681
All me life I've just...

10:02.630 --> 10:04.313
I've just been wrong.

10:05.266 --> 10:08.440
Like, I can't think
proper like everyone else.

10:09.681 --> 10:11.276
You know, me mum always says it...

10:11.282 --> 10:13.483
"You know, if I could
slap the stupid out of ya,

10:13.489 --> 10:14.921
there'd be nothin' left."

10:15.671 --> 10:17.421
She fucking tried.

10:17.570 --> 10:19.222
Still plenty left, but.

10:19.994 --> 10:21.532
Your old lady hit ya?

10:21.580 --> 10:23.863
Yeah. Oh, mate, God...

10:24.902 --> 10:27.081
at the shops or wherever like,

10:27.087 --> 10:30.617
her thong's off her foot and
she's like layin' into me head.

10:30.623 --> 10:32.880
And I'm... No!

10:33.204 --> 10:35.738
- Fucking hell, Booms.
- Nah. Oh, like...

10:35.744 --> 10:38.162
everyone knows you don't
mess with her before lunch

10:38.168 --> 10:39.670
pissed on an empty gut.

10:40.354 --> 10:41.772
She an alcoholic?

10:41.778 --> 10:44.206
Mm, yeah. Like Liz.

10:46.217 --> 10:48.029
When I was in her tummy,

10:48.035 --> 10:51.048
I made her so sick she
had to drink like a fish.

10:51.054 --> 10:52.374
So...

10:52.717 --> 10:55.046
your mum was drinkin'
while pregnant with you?

10:55.052 --> 10:58.457
Yeah. Well, nothin' much changed
when I come out neither, 'ey.

10:59.082 --> 11:02.483
That can... that can fuck
with kids' brains, you know?

11:02.489 --> 11:04.188
Stop it from forming properly.

11:04.292 --> 11:06.925
It's a full-on syndrome.
It's got a name and all.

11:07.203 --> 11:09.208
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

11:09.681 --> 11:13.240
Boomer, if you're sayin' that
you can't think properly, then...

11:13.241 --> 11:14.520
Oh, fuck.

11:16.585 --> 11:19.588
So, if I've got like a syndrome...

11:19.594 --> 11:20.994
then it's not my fault.

11:21.460 --> 11:24.380
Nah, sis, it's not your fault.

11:28.009 --> 11:29.750
Any news on the rat?

11:29.756 --> 11:32.755
- It's Pasquale, has to be.
- Has someone spoken to him?

11:32.761 --> 11:35.938
He's getting bailed today.
Lucas will pay him a visit.

11:38.016 --> 11:39.337
Where's Connors?

11:39.467 --> 11:41.991
Oh, she's gone to medical.
Said she wasn't feeling well.

11:43.030 --> 11:44.581
I don't trust her either.

11:44.587 --> 11:47.845
- You don't trust anyone, Zara.
- I especially don't trust her.

11:50.158 --> 11:51.541
- Hey.
- Hi.

11:51.611 --> 11:53.436
When does Spike get out of the slot?

11:53.442 --> 11:55.514
Uh, in a few days, I think.

11:57.404 --> 11:58.910
Do you think she did it?

11:59.136 --> 12:00.753
Well, she still denying it.

12:01.609 --> 12:03.425
Any chance it could be Sonia?

12:03.648 --> 12:05.053
Stevens hardly knew Gilmour.

12:05.059 --> 12:07.151
What if she killed her
thinking it was Liz.

12:07.157 --> 12:08.460
- What?!
- Well, Liz reckons Sonia

12:08.466 --> 12:10.264
practically confessed to her.

12:10.270 --> 12:11.645
Yeah, but why would
she risk planting the

12:11.651 --> 12:14.167
- murder weapon on Baxter?
- Because she's a psycho.

12:30.766 --> 12:33.173
Told you she's got the hots for you.

12:36.351 --> 12:37.870
Nope.

12:37.948 --> 12:39.500
Maybe it's mutual.

12:40.855 --> 12:42.896
Marie is ancient history.

12:44.855 --> 12:46.055
Good.

12:47.183 --> 12:48.703
Hey, listen...

12:49.481 --> 12:52.520
I gotta do something for Boomer
and I need you to help me.

12:52.526 --> 12:54.004
Yeah, sure, what do you need?

12:54.077 --> 12:56.085
I need you to charm Smiles.

13:40.165 --> 13:42.248
You're gonna shiv me
for makin' a phone call?

13:42.850 --> 13:45.467
You're going to sit
tight and wait for Marie.

14:12.385 --> 14:13.638
Told you.

14:14.398 --> 14:16.152
Oh, Rita.

14:18.092 --> 14:21.109
- I was gonna call my boyfriend, Ray.
- Bullshit.

14:21.485 --> 14:24.605
Had an argument before I was
slotted. I need to speak to him.

14:24.730 --> 14:28.591
- So, use the prison phones.
- They pulled my phone privileges.

14:28.799 --> 14:31.233
- What was it about?
- What?

14:31.295 --> 14:32.574
The argument?

14:32.847 --> 14:35.999
Oh... you know... stupid stuff.

14:36.198 --> 14:38.499
His ex sniffin' around, mainly.

14:40.777 --> 14:42.095
No, call Ray.

14:42.101 --> 14:44.120
- Ah, no, it's OK...
- I insist.

14:55.571 --> 14:56.832
On speaker.

14:59.911 --> 15:02.193
- Hello?
- Ray, it's me, I'm on a burner...

15:02.594 --> 15:04.824
Reets, are you there?

15:05.884 --> 15:08.895
Hey, Ray, what did you and
Rita have an argument about?

15:08.901 --> 15:10.333
Who is this? What's goin' on?

15:10.504 --> 15:12.490
- Last time I...
- Ray?

15:13.585 --> 15:14.885
Ray?

15:16.324 --> 15:18.004
What we always argue about,

15:18.010 --> 15:20.492
my ex. Reets, is everyth... ?

15:23.435 --> 15:26.827
- You understand I had to check?
- Oh, yeah, no worries.

15:26.833 --> 15:28.245
Keep that safe, will ya?

15:28.804 --> 15:30.828
- Are we good?
- Oh, good, yeah.

15:32.407 --> 15:33.973
Next time, just ask.

15:34.209 --> 15:35.415
Yeah.

15:36.632 --> 15:37.832
Sorry about that.

15:50.656 --> 15:52.442
- How's it goin'?
- Yeah, good.

15:53.171 --> 15:55.538
We need to talk about what
we're going to say tomorrow.

15:55.544 --> 15:58.266
- I don't reckon you need me...
- No, just stay positive, stay on story.

15:58.272 --> 16:00.369
- That's all you need to worry about.
- Well, what is the story?

16:00.375 --> 16:03.679
Well, the story is how
fantastic this workshop is!

16:03.688 --> 16:06.208
How it's changed the lives
of the women working here.

16:06.396 --> 16:08.630
People like Boomer, hmm?

16:08.636 --> 16:10.714
Given them a positive future.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.608
How, in spite of all the...

16:13.011 --> 16:14.984
Governor! Ha!

16:16.779 --> 16:19.319
- This as a pleasant surprise.
- I've just seen a question sheet

16:19.325 --> 16:21.371
for tomorrow's interview.
Why is Birdsworth involved?

16:21.377 --> 16:23.104
It'll be good for her self-esteem.

16:23.110 --> 16:25.160
Plus, she's a model for prison reform.

16:25.166 --> 16:27.422
Recidivist turned peer worker.

16:29.419 --> 16:31.026
- Liz?
- Yeah?

16:31.428 --> 16:34.255
Are you comfortable with
this interview tomorrow?

16:38.180 --> 16:39.642
You don't have to do it.

16:40.172 --> 16:42.298
No, I wanna do it.

16:42.482 --> 16:44.006
It'll be good for the women.

16:44.975 --> 16:46.175
Mm.

16:47.484 --> 16:49.785
_

16:50.374 --> 16:52.404
Hey, Miss Miles, um...

16:52.410 --> 16:55.307
I heard my boxing magazine
has arrived. Can I pick it up?

16:55.313 --> 16:57.621
Centre's closed unless
you're doing a TAFE test.

16:57.627 --> 16:59.012
Oh, I just want my mag.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.303
Well, you'll have to
come back on Friday.

17:00.309 --> 17:03.087
Oh, that sucks! Can't I just
pick it up? No-one would know.

17:03.355 --> 17:04.741
Where's the harm in that?

17:05.925 --> 17:07.794
Quite the expensive magazine.

17:09.378 --> 17:10.714
Make it quick.

17:14.923 --> 17:16.683
_

17:22.549 --> 17:24.935
- Get out!
- Come on, Allie, do something.

17:25.924 --> 17:27.694
Shit! Novak!

17:29.479 --> 17:32.685
Sierra 6, I've got a Code Blue
in the education corridor, over.

17:32.691 --> 17:34.084
- What happened?
- Copy that. Sierra 6

17:34.090 --> 17:36.679
- Fucked if I know! She just collapsed.
- Oh, man, I think...

17:36.685 --> 17:39.718
I think I just had a... a dizzy spell.

17:40.849 --> 17:43.207
Yeah, uh, I think I'm
feeling better now.

17:44.102 --> 17:47.103
Uh, it's OK, Miss Miles, I'll
take her back to the unit.

17:47.109 --> 17:49.319
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

17:49.325 --> 17:50.846
Oh, Miss Miles!

17:51.530 --> 17:54.652
- That was the worst acting ever.
- Fuck off!

17:54.658 --> 17:57.163
- It worked, didn't it?
- What's happening?

17:57.413 --> 17:58.633
Boomer...

17:59.526 --> 18:03.028
We just guaranteed you'll
pass the welding test.

18:03.037 --> 18:05.642
- Oh, yeah, you're going to give me a brain transplant?
- Better.

18:06.443 --> 18:08.151
We swiped the test paper.

18:08.157 --> 18:09.713
Get fucked. Are you serious?

18:11.149 --> 18:12.562
That's shopliftin'.

18:13.237 --> 18:14.658
Is this a fuckin' joke?

18:15.183 --> 18:18.263
- It's shopfitting, Booms.
- It's still the wrong paper.

18:18.269 --> 18:20.612
- _
- Oh, fuck!

18:24.994 --> 18:26.377
Dickheads.

18:27.586 --> 18:28.786
Fuckin' idiot!

18:28.792 --> 18:30.873
Attention, compound.
Attention, compound.

18:30.879 --> 18:34.102
- The canteen is now open for H Block.
- Just made a cuppa, would you like one?

18:34.459 --> 18:36.788
- Thanks.
- Sorry about this mornin'.

18:37.850 --> 18:40.528
- Got a bit desperate.
- Oh, it's fine.

18:41.523 --> 18:43.727
Drago's been looking daggers at me.

18:43.733 --> 18:45.829
Oh, I wouldn't worry about
that. She's just jealous.

18:46.338 --> 18:47.932
I'd hate to see her
really take a dislike

18:47.938 --> 18:49.138
- to someone!
- Mmm.

18:49.144 --> 18:51.892
Hey. I just made a cuppa,
you want one? My shout.

18:56.441 --> 18:59.372
- I just spoke with Lucas.
- How did the interview go?

18:59.441 --> 19:02.426
- He says Pasquale's not the rat.
- Can he be sure?

19:02.432 --> 19:04.833
- He chopped off a finger with a chisel...
- All right, all right,

19:04.839 --> 19:07.235
- I don't want to know the details.
- It's not him, believe me.

19:07.241 --> 19:08.837
Then while you're in here with me,

19:08.843 --> 19:11.294
I don't want you doing anything
that's gonna draw attention to us.

19:11.300 --> 19:12.905
I wanna be out of here in six months,

19:12.911 --> 19:15.191
so, keep a low profile,
do you understand?

19:15.580 --> 19:18.178
And for God's sake, get out
of those civvies, will you?

19:18.270 --> 19:21.632
- Fine.
- Tell Lucas to find the rat.

19:34.453 --> 19:35.653
Here.

19:35.827 --> 19:38.419
- These'll sort you out.
- No, thanks.

19:38.626 --> 19:40.742
Last time you gave me
pills, you took my job.

19:40.748 --> 19:43.318
- Mate, relax, they're legit.
- You better not try and stitch me up

19:43.324 --> 19:45.110
- again, Jake, or else...
- Or what?

19:45.189 --> 19:46.456
You kill me?

19:47.282 --> 19:48.893
Mate, just take the fucking tablets.

19:48.899 --> 19:50.409
Do you want Vera getting sus?

19:51.500 --> 19:53.005
I won't tell Vera anything.

19:53.011 --> 19:54.690
You... you can't be sure of that.

19:55.068 --> 19:57.613
Why do you think they use
sleep deprivation in Gitmo?

19:57.653 --> 19:59.699
White for stop, blue for go.

20:01.780 --> 20:04.796
- How many do I take?
- Two at a time.

20:26.369 --> 20:27.969
Sierra 7 to Sierra 3,

20:27.975 --> 20:30.072
we have an electrical
fault in H Block air con.

20:30.078 --> 20:32.261
Ah, this is Sierra 3,
I'm on my way. Over.

20:35.463 --> 20:36.796
Oh, sh...

20:44.078 --> 20:46.871
Oh, shit! Fuck! Argh!

20:47.197 --> 20:49.897
Argh! Ugh! Shit!

20:50.467 --> 20:52.493
- You right, Mr Jackson?
- You all right?

20:52.601 --> 20:54.594
What's wrong with you, Mr Jackson, sir?!

20:54.698 --> 20:55.898
Argh!

20:56.276 --> 20:57.586
Mr Jackson?

20:58.664 --> 21:00.773
Oh, Mr Jackson...

21:04.226 --> 21:05.991
- He's off his head!
- Mr Jackson?

21:06.220 --> 21:08.720
- Uh...
- You all right, Mr Jackson?

21:08.726 --> 21:09.926
Ugh!

21:10.291 --> 21:13.641
- Get out!
- Get out! Get out!

21:14.446 --> 21:16.165
Bloody women only room.

21:17.017 --> 21:18.919
Mr Jackson's lost it!

21:18.925 --> 21:20.320
- Boomer?
- Yo.

21:20.326 --> 21:22.289
Watch the door. Make
sure nobody comes in.

21:23.305 --> 21:24.638
OK.

21:24.992 --> 21:26.447
Nobody come in.

21:27.972 --> 21:29.172
Oh, shit!

21:29.178 --> 21:30.973
- Mr Jackson?
- I said get out!

21:30.979 --> 21:32.448
Will, it's just me.

21:32.454 --> 21:33.948
Are you OK?

21:34.758 --> 21:36.472
Oh, my God, you're
not. I'll get the nurse.

21:36.478 --> 21:39.169
No! No. No.

21:41.388 --> 21:43.297
You can't. I've taken something.

21:43.801 --> 21:45.700
- Boomer...
- What's goin' on, Boomer?

21:45.706 --> 21:47.105
No-one's allowed in.

21:47.111 --> 21:48.407
Says who?

21:48.413 --> 21:49.941
Says Kaz!

21:50.007 --> 21:52.703
She's in there with Mr Jackson,
probably giving him a gobbie.

21:54.022 --> 21:55.518
Is that right?

21:55.906 --> 21:57.221
I dunno.

21:57.710 --> 21:59.145
What's happening, Will?

22:00.730 --> 22:02.330
I don't know. I'm just...

22:02.841 --> 22:05.288
I'm just so exhausted. I can't...

22:05.756 --> 22:07.849
I can't sleep and...

22:10.446 --> 22:13.081
I haven't slept... I haven't
slept since Ferguson...

22:14.776 --> 22:16.074
you know...

22:18.741 --> 22:20.536
You know... you know it was me.

22:22.129 --> 22:23.329
I know.

22:24.452 --> 22:26.361
You had good reason.

22:26.644 --> 22:28.947
I didn't... I didn't just kill her, Kaz.

22:31.781 --> 22:33.503
I buried her alive.

22:33.609 --> 22:35.911
I fucking buried her alive...

22:37.793 --> 22:39.089
And I can't sleep.

22:39.095 --> 22:42.181
And I keep on hear... I keep on
hearing the shovel-loads of dirt

22:42.187 --> 22:43.932
landing on the box and...

22:44.483 --> 22:47.578
- and her inside screaming, and stuff. I...
- Shh, shh.

22:47.584 --> 22:49.300
It's constant, I can't...

22:49.306 --> 22:50.998
- I can't get...
- It's OK.

22:51.062 --> 22:52.813
- I can't get...
- It's OK.

22:53.768 --> 22:56.545
You did that for us, so
that I didn't have to.

22:58.221 --> 23:01.179
I'm still... I'm still a...
I'm still a murderer...

23:01.232 --> 23:03.205
I'm still a murderer, though, fuck!

23:03.726 --> 23:05.046
No.

23:05.726 --> 23:07.013
You...

23:08.213 --> 23:11.901
are the bravest man that I know.

23:18.589 --> 23:20.463
- I've had enough of this.
- Hey, hey, 'ey!

23:20.469 --> 23:22.478
'Ey, Kaz said you can't. Argh!

23:25.899 --> 23:28.480
Fucking hell, Boomer! What
part of "don't let anyone in"

23:28.486 --> 23:29.910
don't you understand?!

23:29.916 --> 23:31.515
She ***, she earned it.

24:38.198 --> 24:41.118
I was just thinking about my son.

24:43.605 --> 24:44.805
And that...

24:45.700 --> 24:47.890
that just eats away at me,

24:47.896 --> 24:49.275
day and night.

24:51.709 --> 24:53.916
But the nights are far worse.

24:57.572 --> 24:59.165
I understand that...

25:00.573 --> 25:02.794
you have to do what
you've gotta do, I...

25:04.167 --> 25:06.488
I was just trying to find some peace.

25:07.488 --> 25:08.871
That's how you do it?

25:09.902 --> 25:11.185
Yeah.

25:14.398 --> 25:17.407
You're tormented, too, I
saw you in the bathroom.

25:18.389 --> 25:19.776
Wasn't what you think.

25:19.974 --> 25:22.241
Yeah, I know what that was.

25:24.024 --> 25:25.861
I know that well.

25:28.520 --> 25:30.349
That's despair.

25:34.266 --> 25:35.893
That was despair.

25:44.179 --> 25:45.583
Get rid of it.

25:46.588 --> 25:49.798
You have to forgive
yourself, first and, that...

25:51.601 --> 25:53.507
I'll never be able to do that.

25:57.587 --> 25:59.005
I meant the drugs.

26:13.847 --> 26:15.078
Boomer.

26:15.395 --> 26:16.595
Hey.

26:19.112 --> 26:21.493
My brain injury isn't my fault neither.

26:22.490 --> 26:24.429
You got a brain injury, too?

26:25.598 --> 26:27.039
I had an accident.

26:27.624 --> 26:29.425
It was a long time ago but...

26:29.713 --> 26:33.280
- before then I was pretty fuckin' smart.
- Yeah, Einstein, 'ey?

26:34.502 --> 26:36.497
My dad used to call me that.

26:36.693 --> 26:37.893
Oh.

26:37.993 --> 26:39.318
No shit, 'ey?

26:39.394 --> 26:41.712
Now I couldn't study to save myself.

26:42.287 --> 26:45.238
- But that's all right, I've got boxing.
- You're ace at that.

26:46.760 --> 26:48.706
Yeah, and you're ace at welding.

26:50.753 --> 26:53.484
That's why you gotta
take the frigging test!

26:53.776 --> 26:56.549
- It's too late 'cause it's tomorrow.
- No.

26:56.857 --> 26:59.119
No, sis, it's never too late.

27:00.882 --> 27:03.419
Hold your arms out. Grab that.

27:03.477 --> 27:06.514
- It's gonna be a long night.
- Oh!

27:07.519 --> 27:10.130
- Take us through a JSA.
- A what?

27:10.136 --> 27:12.853
- Job Safety Analysis.
- I can't do this.

27:12.859 --> 27:14.837
- No, no, no, come on, you know it.
- Booms...

27:14.843 --> 27:17.927
What are the potential
hazards of arc welding?

27:18.036 --> 27:20.137
- Huh?
- What could hurt you?

27:20.143 --> 27:22.718
Oh. Power cord. Radiation.

27:22.724 --> 27:25.821
- Yes! Woo!
- See? Piece of piss!

27:27.432 --> 27:29.969
Where do you point
the fire extinguisher?

27:29.975 --> 27:31.770
At the friggin' fire!

27:32.556 --> 27:33.944
Fuck!

27:35.255 --> 27:38.059
Fuel gas hoses usually...

27:38.544 --> 27:40.246
Oi, Booms?!

27:40.252 --> 27:42.554
Are we freezing our tits
off here for nothing?

27:42.654 --> 27:44.836
Next question. Come on.

27:48.035 --> 27:49.994
You on a hunger strike or something?

27:52.085 --> 27:54.196
Oh, no, I'm too nervous to eat.

27:54.202 --> 27:57.038
No, you'll be right. Just
remember, piece of piss.

27:57.300 --> 28:00.786
Yeah, piece of piss.
Piece of piss... Piece...

28:00.792 --> 28:02.720
I hope you're firing on all cylinders

28:02.726 --> 28:06.427
- for our interview this morning, Liz.
- Oh, yeah, I'm as fresh as a daisy.

28:06.433 --> 28:08.030
Stevens, Birdsworth.

28:08.204 --> 28:09.435
- They're ready for you now.

28:17.324 --> 28:20.159
- Good luck, Booms.
- Good luck, Lizzie. Crush it!

28:20.165 --> 28:22.520
Good luck for you, too. Yeah.

28:23.710 --> 28:26.026
Yeah, the women are pretty
geed up about this interview.

28:26.032 --> 28:27.638
Yeah, I told them they
could listen in, and...

28:27.644 --> 28:29.633
maybe it'll be good for morale.

28:29.639 --> 28:31.332
Good for Stevens' ego.

28:32.044 --> 28:34.207
There's a rumour
circulating about Stevens.

28:34.213 --> 28:35.683
What, she really is an angel?!

28:37.888 --> 28:39.533
That she killed Gilmour.

28:42.510 --> 28:44.937
- What?
- Then framed it on Baxter.

28:45.621 --> 28:47.224
Well, where did you hear that?

28:47.230 --> 28:48.645
I can't tell you that.

28:49.111 --> 28:51.216
But it comes from a reliable source.

28:52.129 --> 28:54.213
I don't doubt Stevens is capable of it

28:54.219 --> 28:55.633
but I think she's smarter than that.

28:55.639 --> 28:58.243
Yeah, it's a big risk to plant
the murder weapon on Baxter.

28:58.608 --> 29:00.324
What could she possibly get from that?

29:21.772 --> 29:24.987
Five minutes past ten. I'm
Marshall Adams and this morning...

29:24.993 --> 29:26.357
- I'm gonna have another word with Stevens
- I'm speaking with

29:26.363 --> 29:28.859
- before they get started...
- Entrepreneur and Angel of Wentworth,

29:28.865 --> 29:30.075
Sonia Stevens?

29:30.081 --> 29:31.752
You've probably seen her in the papers.

29:31.758 --> 29:33.884
Hello, Sonia, welcome to the programme.

29:33.890 --> 29:35.744
Thank you, Marshall. Good morning.

29:35.750 --> 29:36.950
And repeat offender,

29:36.956 --> 29:39.439
mother of two, Elizabeth Birdsworth.

29:40.054 --> 29:42.278
- Oh, yeah, h-hello.
- Lizzie, woo!

29:42.284 --> 29:44.048
So, ladies,

29:44.054 --> 29:47.891
repeat offending is at record
levels across the country

29:47.897 --> 29:51.162
but you're tackling it with
a... with a new programme?

29:51.168 --> 29:52.715
Yes, that's right, Marshall.

29:52.721 --> 29:55.743
Liz and I, with the support
of our governor, Vera Bennett,

29:55.749 --> 30:00.231
we have started a new prison
reform programme called Green Wall,

30:00.237 --> 30:02.529
where we train and employ the women.

30:02.535 --> 30:05.202
And we prepare them for the
outside world, don't we, Liz?

30:05.302 --> 30:07.699
Ah, yeah. That's right, Sonia.

30:07.705 --> 30:10.103
As a matter of fact, some
of our friends and colleagues

30:10.109 --> 30:13.394
are sitting for their TAFE
certificate as we speak,

30:13.400 --> 30:15.524
- so good luck, girls!
- Well, yeah. Yeah, good on you, guys!

30:15.530 --> 30:17.227
That's all very noble.

30:17.233 --> 30:19.239
But my sources tell me, Sonia,

30:19.245 --> 30:22.525
that you shouldn't be in
Wentworth in the first place.

30:22.531 --> 30:24.967
Yes, Marshall, I am changing my plea.

30:24.973 --> 30:29.329
Rumours about police corruption and
a dysfunctional judicial system...

30:29.335 --> 30:31.825
Well, Marshall, you should ask Liz
about that. She knows all about it.

30:31.831 --> 30:33.738
- No, I don't know all about it.
- Yes, of course you do, Liz.

30:33.744 --> 30:35.230
You gave evidence at my trial.

30:35.236 --> 30:36.444
- I...
- You lied in court

30:36.450 --> 30:38.540
to get me convicted, didn't
you? Who put you up to that?

30:38.546 --> 30:40.135
- D-Don!
- Detective Don Kaplan.

30:40.141 --> 30:41.835
You were Witness X, weren't you, Liz?

30:44.636 --> 30:46.008
No bull!

30:47.129 --> 30:48.530
Well, we were in love

30:48.536 --> 30:50.444
- and he asked me to do things.
- OK, shut it down!

30:50.450 --> 30:53.260
- Sexual things?
- Well, I would have. He had a perfect cock.

30:57.540 --> 30:59.454
Get Birdsworth back to her unit!

30:59.543 --> 31:00.908
What the hell was that?!

31:00.914 --> 31:02.431
- My sentiments exactly...
- Shut up!

31:02.518 --> 31:04.599
That is the end of your media campaign.

31:04.605 --> 31:07.004
The next time you make the
papers will be your sentencing.

31:08.091 --> 31:09.677
Just get her out as well!

31:11.885 --> 31:14.214
Time's up. Pens down.

31:14.220 --> 31:16.253
_

31:16.380 --> 31:18.182
Hey! How'd you go?

31:18.188 --> 31:20.045
- Did you smash it?
- I don't want to talk about it.

31:20.051 --> 31:22.174
Oh, come on, Booms. You
gotta give us somethin'.

31:22.254 --> 31:25.564
The whole thing's just
a blur, hey, you know.

31:25.570 --> 31:27.562
Well, it couldn't have gone
as bad as Liz's interview.

31:27.568 --> 31:28.768
Why? What happened?

31:29.433 --> 31:31.953
Oh, God! Oh.

31:32.434 --> 31:35.153
- What did I do?
- Perfect cock?!

31:35.437 --> 31:38.049
Are you trying to sabotage me?!

31:38.241 --> 31:40.989
You sabotaged me!

31:40.995 --> 31:43.010
I told ya I couldn't do it.

31:43.016 --> 31:45.203
We're supposed to be talkin'
about the garden project,

31:45.209 --> 31:48.543
and then you brought up
all that stuff about Don.

31:48.549 --> 31:50.137
If this fucks me up, Elizabeth,

31:50.143 --> 31:53.052
I will do what I have wanted
to do for a very long time.

31:53.058 --> 31:54.932
I will kill you.

31:54.938 --> 31:57.673
Why don't ya? Just do it! Go on!

31:57.679 --> 31:59.471
'Cause I can't do this any more!

31:59.477 --> 32:02.962
It is driving me fucking insane!

32:02.968 --> 32:05.273
- Unh!
- Oh, fuck!

32:05.279 --> 32:06.588
Get off me.

32:08.385 --> 32:10.483
- Pathetic.
- It's true.

32:10.489 --> 32:13.794
I am losing my mind. I'm not well.

32:13.800 --> 32:18.170
- This is bullshit!
- I think I've got dementia! I do!

32:23.686 --> 32:26.215
I... I r... I really do.

32:26.379 --> 32:28.265
Of course.

32:30.079 --> 32:33.016
I am so sorry.

32:34.995 --> 32:36.405
What you need...

32:37.168 --> 32:39.493
is a nice little walk in the yard, hmm?

32:39.499 --> 32:42.686
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Get some fresh air?

32:42.692 --> 32:46.390
Attention, compound.
Work unit is now complete.

32:47.517 --> 32:49.045
Stretch your legs, come on.

32:49.051 --> 32:51.403
- Here she is, the lagger!
- Yeah.

32:52.308 --> 32:54.941
You got a fuckin' death wish, slag?

32:54.947 --> 32:56.529
Everybody, be quiet!

32:56.535 --> 32:58.329
I have something to say.

32:59.118 --> 33:00.816
Quiet, please!

33:01.023 --> 33:02.503
What are you going to say?

33:07.318 --> 33:08.558
Ladies,

33:08.921 --> 33:10.509
I give you...

33:12.037 --> 33:14.952
- Witness X!
- No, no, no, no!

33:15.538 --> 33:17.245
Sonia, why would you do that?

33:17.251 --> 33:19.811
What do they do with the laggers?!

33:19.817 --> 33:21.611
Don't think I can trust her now.

33:22.700 --> 33:24.011
Liz?

33:27.077 --> 33:28.446
She's not here.

33:29.228 --> 33:30.518
Liz?

33:30.705 --> 33:32.222
Oh, fuck!

33:32.890 --> 33:34.504
Serves her right.

33:35.198 --> 33:36.620
Well, she lagged on Sonia.

33:36.626 --> 33:40.603
Didn't mean to do it. It wasn't
my fault! It wasn't my fault!

33:42.036 --> 33:44.084
No, no, no, no. it wasn't my fault!

33:44.090 --> 33:46.633
It wasn't my fuckin'...
It wasn't my fault!

33:46.639 --> 33:49.271
- Gonna teach her a fuckin' lesson.
- Yeah!

33:49.354 --> 33:50.853
No, no!

33:51.843 --> 33:53.913
All right, that's enough! Break it up!

33:55.785 --> 33:57.794
Leave Liz the fuck alone!

34:01.493 --> 34:03.924
Back off! Back off!

34:04.391 --> 34:06.450
Are you... are you all right, Liz.

34:06.456 --> 34:08.455
Liz, it's Kaz. It's OK.

34:10.081 --> 34:12.974
- It's all right. I've gotta get you inside now.
- Back off, ladies!

34:12.980 --> 34:16.179
- I gotta get you inside. You're OK.
- It wasn't my fault! I couldn't help it.

34:16.567 --> 34:19.668
- That's bullshit, Kaz!
- Yeah, why the fuck are you protecting her?

34:19.675 --> 34:20.875
Shut up, Radic!

34:20.880 --> 34:22.299
Let her pass.

34:23.677 --> 34:26.969
It wasn't my fault!

34:27.168 --> 34:30.984
I tried... It wasn't my fault.
I couldn't help it, that's all.

34:31.077 --> 34:32.683
Now will you see the doctor?

34:32.688 --> 34:35.763
I-I... I couldn't help
it. I couldn't help...

34:35.768 --> 34:38.210
- It wasn't... It wasn't my fault. I couldn't...
- I know. Come on. I know.

34:48.217 --> 34:50.598
- You, uh, wanted to see me?
- Yeah, come in.

34:50.702 --> 34:51.989
Sit down.

34:52.780 --> 34:56.683
- You know when you tossed Baxter's cell...
- We... we found the murder weapon.

34:56.688 --> 35:00.184
the anonymous tip-off came from Stevens.

35:00.409 --> 35:01.632
How do you know?

35:01.733 --> 35:04.131
She wanted me to reopen the workshop.

35:04.411 --> 35:06.822
She promised to give us Gilmour's killer

35:06.828 --> 35:09.020
- if I agreed.
- You did a deal with Stevens?

35:09.026 --> 35:10.665
Will, I was desperate.

35:10.671 --> 35:12.120
The board and the
press were all over me,

35:12.126 --> 35:13.855
the police had no idea
who had killed her.

35:13.861 --> 35:16.078
- I thought the prison grapevine...
- So Stevens did do it.

35:16.084 --> 35:17.324
And framed Baxter.

35:17.330 --> 35:19.850
Well, she must've hidden the
weapon somewhere we didn't search.

35:19.856 --> 35:21.725
So we have a weapon

35:21.731 --> 35:24.778
and a motive to frame
Baxter, but no proof.

35:24.784 --> 35:27.750
- Did you find anything on the CCTV?
- No, not yet.

35:27.756 --> 35:29.854
- You wanted to see us?
- Come in.

35:30.772 --> 35:34.205
You all need to hear
this, as my senior staff.

35:34.483 --> 35:37.371
I was forced to dismiss
Nurse Radcliffe today.

35:37.377 --> 35:38.579
Didn't see that coming.

35:38.585 --> 35:41.517
There were drugs missing from
medical that she couldn't account for.

35:41.713 --> 35:43.483
I wish I could say I was surprised,

35:43.489 --> 35:47.360
but people never cease to disappoint me.

35:50.990 --> 35:52.190
Proctor.

35:55.875 --> 35:57.198
How's Liz?

35:57.582 --> 35:59.019
She's with Allie.

35:59.404 --> 36:00.702
Look, um...

36:01.607 --> 36:04.039
I'm really sorry for dumping
my shit on you last night.

36:04.045 --> 36:05.271
It's OK.

36:07.333 --> 36:08.648
Listen, um...

36:09.334 --> 36:10.745
What you said about Stevens,

36:10.751 --> 36:12.222
the governor's looking into it.

36:12.228 --> 36:14.117
She thinks she killed Gilmour too?

36:14.123 --> 36:15.438
And she's investigating whether

36:15.444 --> 36:17.145
she planted the murder weapon on Baxter.

36:17.151 --> 36:19.126
You have to put her in protection.

36:19.132 --> 36:20.747
Well, we have to find proof.

36:20.753 --> 36:23.800
Well, you have to find the proof
before Spike gets out of the slot.

36:23.806 --> 36:25.381
She's gonna want justice.

36:25.798 --> 36:27.810
And I'm gonna have to deliver that.

36:29.983 --> 36:31.620
...dark not white meat.

36:34.383 --> 36:36.117
Ah, fuck off. I'm not interested.

36:36.123 --> 36:37.492
You didn't mind before.

36:37.995 --> 36:40.993
That was because I was
being paid to be a drug mule.

36:40.999 --> 36:42.467
I can pay.

36:43.768 --> 36:46.410
Sorry. Already taken.

36:47.122 --> 36:48.804
I said fuck off!

36:53.985 --> 36:55.228
What was that?

36:55.234 --> 36:56.736
Nothin' I can't handle.

36:56.742 --> 36:58.179
Stay away from her, yeah?

36:59.494 --> 37:01.770
Drago gives me the creeps.

37:18.892 --> 37:21.609
I saw you tryin' to touch
up that young Koori girl.

37:21.886 --> 37:23.751
- What?
- You like black chicks.

37:23.757 --> 37:27.074
- Fuck off!
- Good, 'cause I don't like you either.

37:29.062 --> 37:33.663
_

37:35.533 --> 37:38.518
Unfortunately, that's
all the Serbian I know.

37:45.763 --> 37:47.137
_

37:48.341 --> 37:51.243
- Hey, Zara, what's... Stop it! Get off her!
- Dragovic! Get off her now! Let's go!

37:51.249 --> 37:54.138
- Stop, Zara! Stop, please!
- I'm gonna need assistance in here!

37:54.144 --> 37:55.848
- Get off her!
- Let's go, Dragovic.

37:55.854 --> 37:57.555
You're going to the slot, Dragovic.

37:57.561 --> 37:59.916
Which part of low-profile
don't you understand?

38:00.636 --> 38:01.851
Let's go.

38:04.027 --> 38:06.948
Hey. You OK? You wanna go to medical?

38:07.106 --> 38:08.366
She jumped me.

38:08.687 --> 38:10.212
Lucky you got here when you did.

38:10.510 --> 38:12.989
- Bitch is crazy.
- Yeah.

38:17.078 --> 38:19.087
Now I know you've been
under a lot of pressure,

38:19.388 --> 38:21.104
so just relax.

38:24.502 --> 38:26.490
OK now, Liz, I've got
some questions for you.

38:26.972 --> 38:28.620
Uh, what sort of questions?

38:29.022 --> 38:31.629
Ah, it's a little test.
It's nothing to worry about.

38:31.635 --> 38:33.413
- Just take your time.
- OK.

38:33.798 --> 38:35.921
OK, can you tell me
where we are right now?

38:36.539 --> 38:38.104
Yeah, we're in Wentworth.

38:38.403 --> 38:41.591
- Ah, what city and country?
- Melbourne, Australia.

38:41.597 --> 38:43.528
- Is this really the test?
- Yeah.

38:43.534 --> 38:45.434
- See? There's nothing to worry about.
- Oh.

38:45.819 --> 38:47.422
Now I'm gonna name three things.

38:47.428 --> 38:49.308
and I'll ask you to
repeat them back to me.

38:49.314 --> 38:52.035
Later, I'll ask you again
what they are. Understand?

38:52.041 --> 38:53.629
Yeah, no worries. Go for it.

38:54.435 --> 38:56.815
A teacup, a horse and a basketball.

38:57.024 --> 38:59.537
A teacup, a horse and a basketball.

38:59.543 --> 39:03.529
Great. Now can you count
back from 100 in sevens?

39:04.029 --> 39:08.186
Uh... 100, 93...

39:11.305 --> 39:12.831
87...

39:13.908 --> 39:17.222
80, 73...

39:20.438 --> 39:23.551
- 65.
- OK, great. Thanks, Liz. That's enough.

39:24.038 --> 39:25.778
Now, those three things that I named,

39:25.784 --> 39:27.265
can you tell me what they are?

39:28.836 --> 39:32.314
It was, er, an animal, a-a horse.

39:32.798 --> 39:35.254
Uh, and a mug?

39:36.606 --> 39:38.924
It was a horse, and...

39:39.100 --> 39:40.726
and something.

39:41.310 --> 39:43.469
That's OK. Liz, take a breath.

39:43.475 --> 39:47.421
I know it. I... I... I know
it. It was a horse, a-a cup.

39:47.489 --> 39:48.745
A cup.

39:48.802 --> 39:50.374
A horse, a cup...

40:07.821 --> 40:09.075
Never mind.

40:09.839 --> 40:11.069
We'll move on.

40:16.652 --> 40:17.852
Hey.

40:17.990 --> 40:20.027
I thought you might like to call Ray.

40:22.688 --> 40:24.688
Thanks. I really appreciate it.

40:25.112 --> 40:26.542
It's the least I can do.

40:46.934 --> 40:51.047
I know, I know. Last week's
interview was a debacle.

40:51.053 --> 40:53.437
So you can save your breath
if that's why you're here.

40:53.654 --> 40:55.061
Well, it wasn't great.

40:55.851 --> 40:58.257
But it may not matter,
because I've got better news.

40:58.263 --> 40:59.770
Oh, God! Yes, please.

40:59.969 --> 41:01.668
Don Kaplan's been arrested.

41:01.674 --> 41:04.442
Holed up in some pot den in Amsterdam.

41:07.074 --> 41:08.881
- No imagination.
- Hm!

41:08.887 --> 41:11.797
So he's being extradited
for extortion, corruption

41:11.803 --> 41:14.386
- and perverting the course of justice.
- Well...

41:14.479 --> 41:16.313
- that is good news.
- Mm.

41:16.319 --> 41:19.003
You realise all his cases
are now tainted, don't you?

41:19.009 --> 41:21.217
The DPP only have two witnesses,

41:21.398 --> 41:22.719
a corrupt cop

41:22.994 --> 41:25.198
and a demented old hag.

41:25.633 --> 41:26.940
And they know it.

41:28.019 --> 41:29.900
So I've got a meeting
with them in the morning.

41:30.116 --> 41:32.661
- Splendid.
- Yeah, with a little bit of luck,

41:33.140 --> 41:35.470
I think I'll have you
out of here in 48 hours.

41:39.225 --> 41:41.626
Got a list of your
girlfriends, Mr Stewart?

41:41.632 --> 41:44.253
- TAFE test results.
- Oh, hey, hey, hey!

41:44.433 --> 41:46.866
You know some turtles can
breathe out of their bums?

41:47.004 --> 41:48.912
Serious? I reckon this one could.

41:49.627 --> 41:51.010
Hey, bitches, what's up?

41:51.016 --> 41:52.706
Our test results are in.

41:54.502 --> 41:57.124
- Go on.
- Go on! Don't keep us waiting!

41:57.130 --> 41:58.733
- Go on, Booms!
- Go!

41:58.739 --> 41:59.939
Oh, yeah!

41:59.945 --> 42:01.310
Get out of my fuckin' way.

42:01.518 --> 42:03.221
Move! Move!

42:03.227 --> 42:04.427
- Hey!
- Fuckin' bitch!

42:06.710 --> 42:07.997
How'd ya go, mate?

42:09.702 --> 42:11.186
Hey, Boomer!

42:19.637 --> 42:20.837
Susan.

42:21.950 --> 42:23.651
I didn't think you were talking to me.

42:23.657 --> 42:24.857
I'm not.

42:24.863 --> 42:28.057
That's a shame. I do
miss our little chats.

42:29.646 --> 42:31.232
Suck that up!

42:32.031 --> 42:34.852
You were wrong. I'm not a dumb-arse.

42:34.923 --> 42:38.422
- C+!
- Yeah!

42:38.486 --> 42:41.162
- I knew you had it in you!
- Oh, bullshit!

42:41.366 --> 42:44.437
You just had to believe in yourself.

42:44.443 --> 42:46.798
A drink, to celebrate?

42:47.775 --> 42:49.505
I'm not talking to ya.

42:49.583 --> 42:52.583
That's all right. Just drink!

42:59.287 --> 43:01.053
You're celebrating...

43:01.533 --> 43:03.034
and so am I.

43:07.953 --> 43:09.563
All right, what are you so happy about?

43:10.768 --> 43:14.838
My release. In two days, I will be free.

43:15.209 --> 43:16.477
Do you know what that means?

43:16.483 --> 43:18.700
- Yeah, you're outta here.
- I am...

43:18.706 --> 43:21.996
and now that you have
your TAFE certificate,

43:22.002 --> 43:25.193
the workshop will all be yours.

43:25.583 --> 43:28.055
Yeah, fuck!

43:28.280 --> 43:29.882
What's the occasion?

43:29.888 --> 43:32.935
- Sonia's gettin' out in two days.
- Is that right?

43:33.045 --> 43:36.259
- Boomer, make yourself scarce.
- Oh, I'm... I-I'm celebratin'.

43:36.265 --> 43:37.943
Celebrate somewhere else.

43:39.586 --> 43:40.786
Mm.

43:45.478 --> 43:47.872
Well, you certainly
know how to kill a party.

43:48.672 --> 43:52.083
Well, I know that you killed Gilmour.

43:52.903 --> 43:55.298
And that you framed Spike for it.

43:55.304 --> 43:58.591
Oh, you've been talking
to the demented old hag.

43:58.597 --> 44:01.384
- You know she's losing her marbles.
- You're fucked.

44:01.691 --> 44:03.205
You're not going anywhere.

44:03.211 --> 44:07.356
That is your professional,
legal opinion, is it?

44:07.362 --> 44:09.662
I don't need a legal opinion.

44:09.668 --> 44:12.379
When Spike gets out
of the slot tomorrow,

44:13.262 --> 44:14.953
I'm going to put it to the women.

44:15.828 --> 44:17.735
Let them decide what to do with you.

44:17.741 --> 44:21.638
So you think you can try

44:21.924 --> 44:24.537
the Angel of Wentworth?

44:24.630 --> 44:27.138
I can. And I will.

44:27.703 --> 44:29.986
I just hope, for your sake,

44:30.290 --> 44:32.194
things don't get out of hand.

44:32.986 --> 44:35.195
I mean, you remember
what they did to Ferguson.

44:35.780 --> 44:37.780
You could be out in two days...

44:38.589 --> 44:40.473
or dead in one.

45:06.643 --> 45:09.934
Next Tuesday, 8.30pm on Showcase...

45:10.539 --> 45:12.841
You remember what they did to Ferguson.

45:12.985 --> 45:16.635
You could be out in two
days, or dead in one.

45:18.420 --> 45:20.595
You need to protect me.

45:20.601 --> 45:22.633
Someone might get
jealous, about my release,

45:22.639 --> 45:24.719
- try and hurt me...
- No-one's gonna touch ya!

45:24.725 --> 45:28.051
You had everything: money, power.

45:28.057 --> 45:29.874
You're gonna have to trust
me. Whatever happens in there,

45:29.880 --> 45:31.382
you play along, OK?

45:32.957 --> 45:36.602
New Wentworth, next Tuesday, 8.30pm.
