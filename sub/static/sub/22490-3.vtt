00:19.152 --> 00:20.983
It's alive!

00:40.507 --> 00:43.271
- Pac?
- Biggie!

00:45.178 --> 00:47.976
Good morning, Betsy.
How's it coming?

00:48.014 --> 00:50.039
Huh? Huh? What do you think?

00:50.083 --> 00:52.813
It's... a little gay.

00:53.820 --> 00:55.048
Hey again, Betsy.

00:55.088 --> 00:57.818
What's the new idea for today?

00:59.793 --> 01:03.251
You crazy, girl. Oh, you crazy.

01:03.296 --> 01:06.493
OK, Betsy.
What can you show me today?

01:06.533 --> 01:08.296
Well...

01:08.334 --> 01:10.199
Ah, crap.

01:10.236 --> 01:12.830
Well, I guess it'll have to do.

01:15.742 --> 01:17.175
Excuse me, miss.

01:17.210 --> 01:21.476
Whoa. Aren't you that Subway guy
who used to be a big, fat slob?

01:21.514 --> 01:22.981
What's the name...
Jerry?

01:23.016 --> 01:25.951
Jared. Hi. Uh,
is there a restroom here?

01:27.187 --> 01:29.451
Uh, I must've passed out
from the strain...

01:29.489 --> 01:31.286
of pushing that enormous log
out of my butt.

01:31.324 --> 01:34.691
Did my dookie fumes
clear out the whole bakery?

01:36.496 --> 01:39.021
I'm locked in!
I'll be here all weekend...

01:39.065 --> 01:41.158
with nothing to eat
but... but...

01:42.502 --> 01:45.733
So... delicious.

01:45.772 --> 01:47.797
No! I must stay on my diet.

01:47.841 --> 01:50.207
I'm a corporate spokesman,
hero to millions.

01:50.243 --> 01:52.438
I must... I must...

02:10.263 --> 02:12.629
My bakery! It's ruined!

02:12.665 --> 02:14.963
I only locked up
ten minutes ago!

02:15.001 --> 02:16.263
I'm calling the police.

02:16.302 --> 02:18.065
Wait a minute. You don't have
to call the police.

02:18.104 --> 02:21.130
Heh. We can work
this out like...

02:23.209 --> 02:25.006
...missing since last Tuesday...

02:25.044 --> 02:27.444
One, two-hoo...

02:29.349 --> 02:31.340
I want to see other people.

02:31.384 --> 02:32.578
Rahh?!

02:32.619 --> 02:37.556
December 24,
4:30 pm, Christmas Eve.

02:37.590 --> 02:40.457
A time for joyous celebration.

02:40.493 --> 02:44.486
A time for gift-giving,
for peace and love.

02:44.531 --> 02:46.726
A time for murder.

02:58.811 --> 03:01.712
It was the Christmas
that made everyone cry...

03:01.748 --> 03:03.511
except for maybe the Jews...

03:03.550 --> 03:05.711
but when the evidence
pointed to murder...

03:05.752 --> 03:08.152
the question on
everyone's mind became...

03:08.188 --> 03:09.985
"Who killed Christmas?"

03:11.324 --> 03:13.884
Perhaps no one can
shed light on this mystery...

03:13.927 --> 03:15.554
more than Martha Claus...

03:15.595 --> 03:18.462
the victim's wife of 43 years.

03:18.498 --> 03:21.729
We stayed together
mostly due to licensing issues.

03:21.768 --> 03:24.100
I doubt he would've gotten
any sponsorship deals...

03:24.137 --> 03:27.436
if he were a divorced single man
living with a bunch of elves.

03:27.473 --> 03:29.202
They'd think he was gay.

03:29.242 --> 03:30.573
Crushed by grief...

03:30.610 --> 03:34.046
the widow claus has kept
a low profile since the murder.

03:34.080 --> 03:37.243
But not all was warmth and love
at the North Pole.

03:37.283 --> 03:40.081
Deep inside
Santa's fabled workshop...

03:40.119 --> 03:42.053
discontent
had begun to spread...

03:42.088 --> 03:44.420
among the androgynous
elfin workforce.

03:44.457 --> 03:46.721
It was all about the coke, man.

03:46.759 --> 03:50.286
Santa had us elves hide the blow
in the crappy wooden toys.

03:51.631 --> 03:53.690
Then he'd make the drop...

03:53.733 --> 03:55.860
Give it to me! Toy!
Gimme, gimme toy!

03:55.902 --> 03:58.928
Gimme, gimme, gimme toy!
Gimme, gimme, gimme toy!

03:58.972 --> 04:00.872
And the sale was complete.

04:00.907 --> 04:01.965
Ohh.

04:02.008 --> 04:05.171
He tried using some different
ways to sneak the product in.

04:08.014 --> 04:10.744
You ever see a yeti
when a dozen condoms of coke...

04:10.783 --> 04:12.216
burst in his belly?

04:22.795 --> 04:25.457
It's a bad scene, man.

04:25.498 --> 04:27.466
Were the allegations true?

04:27.500 --> 04:30.526
Santa Claus
an international drug peddler?

04:30.570 --> 04:33.004
Drugs? That wasn't no secret.

04:33.039 --> 04:35.337
But I'll tell you what
the fat man's real problem was...

04:35.375 --> 04:36.672
when some of the shipments...

04:36.709 --> 04:38.939
started to turn up
a little light. Follow me?

04:38.978 --> 04:41.037
Somebody started having
little private parties...

04:41.080 --> 04:43.207
you know what I'm saying?
I think you do.

04:43.249 --> 04:44.944
As for who, well...

04:44.984 --> 04:47.885
you ever wonder
how his nose got so red?

04:47.920 --> 04:52.983
Punishment was swift for anyone
who dared cross the boss.

04:53.026 --> 04:55.085
Happy birthday!

04:55.128 --> 04:58.962
For anyone caught being naughty
at the North Pole.

04:58.998 --> 05:00.863
Happy birthday...

05:05.305 --> 05:07.637
Who killed Santa Claus?

05:07.674 --> 05:11.906
A neglected housewife?
Colombian drug runners?

05:11.944 --> 05:14.504
Some retard snowman?

05:14.547 --> 05:17.015
We may never know
who killed Santa Claus...

05:17.050 --> 05:19.280
but whoever did
is still out there...

05:19.319 --> 05:21.514
watching, waiting.

05:21.554 --> 05:25.388
Who's next?
The Easter bunny? Cupid?

05:25.425 --> 05:27.950
That Lucky Charms cereal guy?

05:27.994 --> 05:31.157
Who's to say?
But when it does happen...

05:31.197 --> 05:34.166
<i>Unsolved Case Files</i>
will be there to make a buck.

05:34.200 --> 05:36.828
Next time on
<i>Unsolved Case Files...</i>

05:36.869 --> 05:39.895
the Taco Bell chihuahua's
castration...

05:39.939 --> 05:42.339
simple neutering or hate crime?

05:42.375 --> 05:44.309
<i>Yo quiero</i> my nuts!

05:45.778 --> 05:47.143
Come and get some!

05:52.518 --> 05:54.145
What's wrong, Herman?

05:54.187 --> 05:56.655
Ooh, I'm constipated, Pickles.

05:56.689 --> 06:00.181
Do you have anything
that you can give me for that?

06:00.226 --> 06:01.887
Yeah.

06:01.928 --> 06:03.623
Side effects may include...

06:03.663 --> 06:06.131
I just kicked your [Bleep] ass!

06:08.267 --> 06:11.964
Brandon, you are so grounded.

06:12.004 --> 06:14.199
<i>Jaws</i> was a masterpiece
of suspense and terror...

06:14.240 --> 06:16.265
because of how little you saw
of the shark itself...

06:16.309 --> 06:17.936
but that's not the way
I wanted it.

06:17.977 --> 06:20.275
The damn mechanical shark
didn't work.

06:20.313 --> 06:22.144
As a result,
I had to release a movie...

06:22.181 --> 06:23.876
that was only a quarter done.

06:23.916 --> 06:25.907
Now, thanks to
computer graphics...

06:25.952 --> 06:28.853
I can bring
my true vision to life.

06:28.888 --> 06:31.948
$10,000 for me by myself.
For that you get the head...

06:31.991 --> 06:34.084
the tail, the whole damn thing.

06:34.127 --> 06:37.324
I say we let him go.

06:37.363 --> 06:39.490
Get out of the water!

06:39.532 --> 06:41.227
<i>Jaws: The Special Edition...</i>

06:41.267 --> 06:43.360
features
over 100 altered scenes.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.769
There he is, Chief!
Throw it! Throw it!

06:45.805 --> 06:48.205
You actually get a feel
for the shark's personality.

06:48.241 --> 06:51.404
You missed me,
you dried-up douchebags!

06:51.444 --> 06:53.105
Ow! My tibia!

06:53.146 --> 06:57.105
Ah, you bastard!
Ah, you bastard!

06:57.150 --> 07:00.642
Trust me, this is
a whole new set... of <i>Jaws.</i>

07:00.686 --> 07:03.018
Smile, you son of a bitch.

07:08.828 --> 07:10.489
Everyone's playing
the brand-new game...

07:10.530 --> 07:12.157
that's fur-ociously fun.

07:12.198 --> 07:13.187
- Yay!
- Yay!

07:13.232 --> 07:15.666
I'm having fun!

07:15.701 --> 07:18.329
Uh-oh. Euthanasia.

07:18.371 --> 07:19.497
Euthanasia!

07:19.539 --> 07:22.030
Euthanasia makes you kill your pets

07:22.074 --> 07:24.838
The circle of life
has never been this exciting.

07:26.245 --> 07:28.805
What am I gonna do
with all these kittens?

07:30.016 --> 07:31.244
Euthanasia!

07:31.284 --> 07:33.775
Laugh and learn
because it's life or death

07:33.820 --> 07:36.311
My pit bull ripped the face
off a toddler.

07:36.355 --> 07:38.755
- Time to put him down!
- I can retrain him.

07:38.791 --> 07:40.486
- No. Euthanasia!
- No. Euthanasia!

07:45.965 --> 07:47.865
My father has been kidnapped...

07:47.900 --> 07:50.368
because he refuses
to pay protection money...

07:50.403 --> 07:52.166
to a bunch of thugs!

07:53.406 --> 07:55.806
Sorry, lady,
we're gonna pass on this one.

07:55.842 --> 07:57.776
But... but...

07:59.212 --> 08:01.578
All right.
Who's our next appointment?

08:01.614 --> 08:03.741
My father has been kidnapped...

08:03.783 --> 08:05.717
because he refuses
to pay protection money...

08:05.751 --> 08:07.412
to a bunch of thugs.

08:07.453 --> 08:10.217
Lady, you just hired the A-Team.

08:13.559 --> 08:16.084
I ain't flying, Hannibal.
No way, no how.

08:16.128 --> 08:18.926
That's sounds
perfectly reasonable, B.A.

08:18.965 --> 08:22.196
Now, calm down
and have some nice milk.

08:25.271 --> 08:26.602
Mmm. Milk.

08:26.639 --> 08:28.436
Good for the bones.
Good for the kids.

08:28.474 --> 08:30.942
I pity the fool who ain't got
no calcium in his diet.

08:30.977 --> 08:33.969
Murdock, we drugged the milk!

08:34.013 --> 08:35.878
You know,
years of drugged milk...

08:35.914 --> 08:37.940
can have unfortunate
side effects.

08:37.984 --> 08:39.474
Oh, yeah? Like what, Murdock?

08:39.519 --> 08:41.817
Severe lactose intolerance.

08:41.854 --> 08:44.652
I don't like cheese.

08:44.690 --> 08:49.457
Can you roll down the windows
in a helicopter?

08:49.495 --> 08:51.929
This is gonna be a long trip.

08:51.964 --> 08:53.659
I want my rubber ducky.

08:53.699 --> 08:56.691
OK, Face, infiltrate the office
and steal their files.

08:56.736 --> 08:58.067
Easy as pie.

08:58.104 --> 09:00.572
Greetings.
Is this where the thugs...

09:00.606 --> 09:02.198
and/or criminals hang out?

09:02.241 --> 09:05.039
Because I, too,
am a thug and/or criminal.

09:05.077 --> 09:07.409
Holy crap,
it's Faceman from the A-Team!

09:07.446 --> 09:08.504
Get him!

09:08.548 --> 09:09.981
Hannibal, they're onto us!

09:17.757 --> 09:20.624
Easy, boys. We surrender.

09:20.660 --> 09:23.788
We're gonna come back
and deal with you heroes later.

09:23.829 --> 09:26.593
All right.
Let's assess the situation.

09:26.632 --> 09:28.998
- I found a lawnmower.
- I found some thimbles.

09:29.035 --> 09:30.434
I found Jesus!

09:32.972 --> 09:34.462
Let's show these punks...

09:34.507 --> 09:36.566
what it means
to mess with the A-Team.

09:46.819 --> 09:48.116
OK, gang.

09:48.154 --> 09:50.782
Let's get froggy
on these tadpoles.

10:14.146 --> 10:16.137
Now, are you gonna leave
that old man...

10:16.182 --> 10:17.513
and his daughter alone?

10:17.550 --> 10:19.643
Yes! For God's sake, yes!

10:19.685 --> 10:22.677
That's all I needed to hear.
B.A., do the honors.

10:22.722 --> 10:24.986
I'm gonna fly you out
on Knuckle Airlines.

10:25.024 --> 10:26.355
Fist class.

10:26.392 --> 10:28.519
My azaleas!

10:30.296 --> 10:32.560
A-Team, you did it.

10:32.598 --> 10:34.395
You saved our family business.

10:34.433 --> 10:35.923
It was our pleasure.

10:35.968 --> 10:38.232
Oh, and by the way,
that'll be $50,000.

10:38.270 --> 10:42.832
$50,000? Our whole business
is only worth 10,000!

10:42.875 --> 10:43.933
We're ruined! Ruined!

10:43.976 --> 10:46.809
I love it when a plan
comes together.

10:46.846 --> 10:47.870
You guys are great.

10:47.913 --> 10:50.108
Look at that douchebag!

10:50.149 --> 10:52.515
He's just as good-looking as me!
