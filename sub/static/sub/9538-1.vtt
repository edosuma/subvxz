WEBVTT

00:29.330 --> 00:30.996
-Good morning, bay area!

00:30.998 --> 00:32.598
It's a beautiful Monday.

00:32.600 --> 00:33.832
Hope you'll get out there

00:33.834 --> 00:36.001
and try to forget
about this past weekend,

00:36.003 --> 00:37.803
especially you sports fans.

00:37.805 --> 00:41.507
I've never seen so much bad luck
in three days of my life.

00:41.509 --> 00:44.343
If anybody put money down
on our bay-area favorites,

00:44.345 --> 00:46.178
you might want to think
about robbing a bank

00:46.180 --> 00:47.746
and getting out of the country.

00:47.748 --> 00:50.616
Or maybe you should just
go back to Vegas and stay there.

00:50.618 --> 00:53.352
I don't what to stay
besides "music cures all."

00:53.354 --> 00:54.620
Here's hoping this new track

00:54.622 --> 00:57.056
from "the illness" will do
just that.

01:01.028 --> 01:02.895
-Yeah?
-Thomas!

01:02.897 --> 01:07.433
Hey, it's Sam calling
for my dad, Carl.

01:07.435 --> 01:08.834
You have had

01:08.836 --> 01:11.503
some of the worst luck anyone
has ever had.

01:11.505 --> 01:13.272
-I can have your money
for you in a week.

01:13.274 --> 01:14.673
-A week?
The last time

01:14.675 --> 01:16.775
my dad waited a week,
i had to find the guy.

01:16.777 --> 01:18.744
Had to track him down
and cut off his finger.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.012
Had to bring it back to my dad.

01:20.014 --> 01:21.513
Ended up being the wrong finger.

01:21.515 --> 01:23.115
The point is I got trouble.
See, it's about image.

01:23.117 --> 01:25.451
I can't go around cutting off
everybody's fingers.

01:25.453 --> 01:27.186
There's only digits
on a guy's hands,

01:27.188 --> 01:29.321
then I got to move to toes --
-I'll get it, all right?

01:29.323 --> 01:30.622
Look,
I'm on a new film right now.

01:30.624 --> 01:32.091
I could just ask --
-a new blockbuster

01:32.093 --> 01:33.459
like your last couple?

01:33.461 --> 01:35.294
What was that last one
you did with, uh...

01:35.296 --> 01:36.962
With a plot?

01:36.964 --> 01:38.831
-Just give me some time.

01:38.833 --> 01:39.798
I'll have it.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.934
-Well, I'm sure.
I'll see you soon.

01:46.107 --> 01:48.107
-Hey, pop?

01:48.109 --> 01:50.008
This guy's not gonna
come up with 15 grand,

01:50.010 --> 01:51.844
even if he had a week.

01:54.215 --> 01:57.516
You wanna make a bet this
becomes an amazing action movie?

02:16.637 --> 02:17.870
-Tomas will be
out any second now.

02:17.872 --> 02:19.404
Don't start the car
until we see him.

02:19.406 --> 02:21.406
-Hi, you've reached Sara.
I'm not available.

02:21.408 --> 02:23.442
Give me a call,
but leave me a message.

02:35.289 --> 02:36.321
-Don't worry about the sign.

02:36.323 --> 02:37.823
It's a low-budget gig.

02:37.825 --> 02:39.458
I'm sure you're gonna get
some great action for your reel.

02:39.460 --> 02:42.094
-Okay.

03:01.348 --> 03:03.916
-Hey, guys. Sorry for the wait.
There was a huge order

03:03.918 --> 03:05.350
put in before yours --
a little bit confusion.

03:05.352 --> 03:06.685
-Are you gonna put it down

03:06.687 --> 03:07.953
or are you gonna
keep babbling like an idiot?

03:07.955 --> 03:09.855
You mean to tell me
whose is which?

03:09.857 --> 03:11.356
That's mine.

03:11.358 --> 03:14.026
So put his there and give
me my plate!

03:14.028 --> 03:15.994
-Oh, here.

03:15.996 --> 03:19.498
-What are you doing?
-You're fired!

03:19.500 --> 03:21.533
-I didn't --

04:06.280 --> 04:07.512
-hey, Sara.

04:07.514 --> 04:09.014
-Hey, baby.
-I need to crash with you

04:09.016 --> 04:10.616
for a couple of nights.
Is that all right?

04:10.618 --> 04:12.818
-Yeah, sure.
Is everything okay?

04:12.820 --> 04:13.986
-It's too hard
to explain right now.

04:13.988 --> 04:15.520
-All right.
I'll see you soon.

04:15.522 --> 04:17.589
-All right, thanks, bye.

05:01.035 --> 05:04.102
-So, you've known Nick
longer than I have?

05:04.104 --> 05:05.804
-Uh, yeah.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.339
I've known Nick
since we were kids.

05:07.341 --> 05:11.076
But you been working with him
for two years now, right?

05:11.078 --> 05:13.045
-Uh-huh.
So, um,

05:13.047 --> 05:16.381
Nick probably gave you
a good idea of what we do here.

05:16.383 --> 05:19.318
-Yeah, he said you guys
get paid pretty well

05:19.320 --> 05:21.019
for just taking a few pictures

05:21.021 --> 05:22.821
and, uh...

05:22.823 --> 05:26.858
Every now and then, things get
a little physical, but...

05:26.860 --> 05:28.994
It's not like you guys
are running around in the middle

05:28.996 --> 05:33.598
of a gun fight or something,
right?

05:33.600 --> 05:36.201
Right?

05:36.203 --> 05:39.371
-Is that what he said?

05:39.373 --> 05:40.539
-W-well, yeah.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.007
Is that --
-don't worry about that.

05:42.009 --> 05:44.910
Listen, sometimes things
get a little physical,

05:44.912 --> 05:46.712
but I'm assuming
since Nick sent you here

05:46.714 --> 05:49.681
today to fill in for him
that you understand that.

05:49.683 --> 05:53.151
- Well... yeah.

05:53.153 --> 05:56.588
But...

05:56.590 --> 05:58.857
-Yo.
-Hey, is punk ass there?

05:58.859 --> 06:00.926
-Yeah, your guy's here.
You wanna stop by?

06:00.928 --> 06:03.595
-Listen, I just got a ticket
for parking --

06:03.597 --> 06:06.098
-yeah, okay.

06:09.236 --> 06:12.604
-Who was that?

06:12.606 --> 06:14.639
-You blind?

06:17.778 --> 06:19.778
This the guy?
-Yep.

06:19.780 --> 06:21.046
That's him.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.414
-Was that -- did you just call?

06:22.416 --> 06:23.915
-Don't matter.
Stand up.

06:23.917 --> 06:25.517
-Wait, is this -- is this --
-don't worry about it.

06:25.519 --> 06:27.619
Get up.

06:31.825 --> 06:34.259
What are you, like, 20?

06:34.261 --> 06:36.328
-No --
-doesn't matter.

06:51.145 --> 06:55.847
-Wait, wait!

06:55.849 --> 06:58.150
How far is this supposed to go?

07:06.693 --> 07:09.661
Hey...

07:12.299 --> 07:14.065
-Nice.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.472
-What, are you guys nuts?
-Hey, hey.

07:20.474 --> 07:24.509
I didn't know he was gonna
do all of that.

07:24.511 --> 07:26.211
-And who is he?

07:26.213 --> 07:27.546
-That's Stan.

07:27.548 --> 07:29.014
He's an old buddy of Nick and I.

07:29.016 --> 07:30.382
He's been a bounty hunter
for a couple of years now,

07:30.384 --> 07:32.584
so, you know,
we help each other out on cases.

07:32.586 --> 07:35.187
-You work with this guy?

07:35.189 --> 07:36.455
-Sometimes.

07:36.457 --> 07:37.722
You got the job, by the way.

07:37.724 --> 07:39.291
-Uh --
-grab that folder right there.

07:39.293 --> 07:41.993
We're gonna make a run, drop off
some pictures to a client.

07:41.995 --> 07:46.531
Then you and I get to start
on this new case together.

07:46.533 --> 07:47.566
-Wha-- I --

07:47.568 --> 07:51.002
what about -- what about Stan?

07:51.004 --> 07:54.005
-But Josh handled himself like a
pro just like you said he would.

07:56.043 --> 07:58.009
-Hey!
-All right, he's coming.

07:58.011 --> 08:00.178
I'll call you back.

08:03.851 --> 08:05.550
-Oh, you seem very okay
with everything

08:05.552 --> 08:07.586
that just happened in there.
Man, I'm not cool with that.

08:07.588 --> 08:10.021
-Listen, I'm not putting my life
in the hands of someone

08:10.023 --> 08:12.290
who needs some warning
before something goes down.

08:12.292 --> 08:14.860
I wanted to see what you got.
Stan was down to help.

08:14.862 --> 08:16.595
Now, you handled yourself
like Nick said you could,

08:16.597 --> 08:19.598
but I had to be sure.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.032
If you want to fill in for Nick,

08:21.034 --> 08:22.934
I got your back as long
as you agree to get mine.

08:22.936 --> 08:25.804
It's the only way
this is gonna work.

08:25.806 --> 08:28.106
-I told Nick
I'd help fill in for him 'cause

08:28.108 --> 08:29.774
him and his girl
are having a baby

08:29.776 --> 08:31.243
and he'd do the same thing
for me.

08:31.245 --> 08:32.177
-Otherwise, what?

08:32.179 --> 08:34.346
You'd go get another job?
-Yeah.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.679
-Oh, really?

08:35.682 --> 08:38.283
'Cause Nick told me about
the last couple jobs you had.

08:38.284 --> 08:40.585
-I could make money
doing something else.

08:40.587 --> 08:42.888
-Not as much as you
would with me, but, you know,

08:42.890 --> 08:46.124
it's up to you.

08:46.126 --> 08:49.394
-I'm down as long
as that is my last test.

08:49.396 --> 08:51.396
-I told you you got the job.
Why would I need to test you

08:51.398 --> 08:53.298
again?

08:57.037 --> 08:59.738
So?

08:59.740 --> 09:03.575
-All right.
All right.

09:03.577 --> 09:05.944
-Come on.

09:05.946 --> 09:08.413
So, I'm curious.
You ever use a gun?

09:08.415 --> 09:10.015
-Yeah, at a range.

09:10.017 --> 09:11.416
-Okay, good.
-Wait, wait, wait.

09:11.418 --> 09:13.952
Is getting shot
at a part of this job?

09:13.954 --> 09:15.420
-Thinking positive is good,

09:15.422 --> 09:17.822
but being prepared
is even better.

09:17.824 --> 09:19.391
-Do you have a gun?

09:19.393 --> 09:20.692
Did Nick have a gun?

09:20.694 --> 09:21.760
-No, Nick never carried a gun.

09:21.762 --> 09:24.162
That's probably why he got shot.

09:24.164 --> 09:25.964
I'm joking.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.632
I think Nick would have told you
if he got shot.

09:27.634 --> 09:30.101
-Well, I don't know!
He didn't tell me about Stan!

09:30.103 --> 09:31.336
That's not funny, man.

09:31.338 --> 09:33.004
-I just want you to know
I'm carrying.

09:33.006 --> 09:34.139
And I've never had to use mine,

09:34.141 --> 09:35.340
but I feel better
having it on me.

09:35.342 --> 09:36.975
So, you know, whatever you want.
Come on.

09:36.977 --> 09:38.543
Let's go.
Let's go.

09:48.388 --> 09:50.755
-So, shouldn't I get
a bullet-proof vest?

09:50.757 --> 09:52.390
-Yeah,
that's probably a good idea.

09:52.392 --> 09:54.626
-Well, then
shouldn't you get one, too?

09:54.628 --> 09:56.494
-No, why?
I already have one.

10:02.002 --> 10:04.002
-So, who's this client
we're gonna go see?

10:04.004 --> 10:07.138
-Check out that folder.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.573
-So, what, we just --

10:08.575 --> 10:10.642
we go over there, drop off
the pictures, that's it?

10:10.644 --> 10:13.845
-Yeah, then we start looking
for the action stars.

10:13.847 --> 10:16.948
They're in there.
You'll see.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.483
-I don't recognize this guy
at all.

10:18.485 --> 10:21.286
-Tomas de la Cruz is actually
a popular action star

10:21.288 --> 10:25.156
from a small town in Peru.
He made some cheesy action films

10:25.158 --> 10:27.092
and now he's got
himself a little cult following.

10:27.094 --> 10:30.061
-What do you mean "cheesy"
action films?

11:11.605 --> 11:16.808
-Cut!

11:16.810 --> 11:18.877
What the hell?
-What's wrong?

11:18.879 --> 11:21.913
-Somebody got the boom
in the shot.

11:21.915 --> 11:24.416
-Somebody got in my shot.

11:24.418 --> 11:25.617
-Who?

11:25.619 --> 11:27.352
-Jesus Christ.

11:27.354 --> 11:28.987
-Well,
I'm not doing all that again,

11:28.989 --> 11:32.123
so you guys better just cut
that up and take it from, uh,

11:32.125 --> 11:37.228
this guy's fall.
-Uh, he's, uh, not conscious.

11:37.230 --> 11:38.830
-What?

11:38.832 --> 11:41.933
-This is not the fake piece
of wood.

11:41.935 --> 11:46.171
-Why would there be any real
pieces of wood anywhere near me

11:46.173 --> 11:48.873
during this part of the fight?
And what is the purpose,

11:48.875 --> 11:52.210
if I may ask,
of all this powder?

11:54.147 --> 11:55.880
-I told you
there's too much powder.

11:55.882 --> 11:57.415
-Told me?
-Yeah. Yeah, you.

11:57.417 --> 11:59.117
-Why is that my responsibility?

11:59.119 --> 12:00.318
Have him do it.
-Hey, hold up.

12:00.320 --> 12:03.388
Hold up. What?
I could do it.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.256
-Wow.
All right, you know what?

12:05.258 --> 12:08.293
He can do it, okay?
I'm gonna go take a break.

12:08.295 --> 12:09.861
You guys figure it out.
Let me know when you need me.

12:09.863 --> 12:12.030
And get this guy some medical
attention or something.

12:12.032 --> 12:14.132
Jesus.

12:42.395 --> 12:43.595
-Tomas.

12:43.597 --> 12:45.864
-Manny, just tell Carl
that I'm getting paid

12:45.866 --> 12:48.767
enough for this masterpiece
I'm working on now.

12:48.769 --> 12:51.870
-Yeah, okay.

12:51.872 --> 12:53.505
Who's this?

12:53.507 --> 12:54.873
-What?

12:54.875 --> 12:56.508
That's just --

12:56.510 --> 12:59.944
that's just his fan that came up
to me and wanted an autograph.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.880
- Yeah.

13:01.882 --> 13:06.217
Yeah, sure he is.
Come on.

13:06.219 --> 13:09.654
You know I'm here to bring back
something of value.

13:09.656 --> 13:11.422
-All right.
I got some cash in the car,

13:11.424 --> 13:13.358
all right?
Just hang on.

13:13.360 --> 13:14.726
-Yeah, let me come with you.

13:14.728 --> 13:17.328
Make sure your fans
don't get too hostile.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.747
-Tomas's beatdown
put Carl's right-hand-man

13:35.749 --> 13:37.582
in the hospital.
-Damn.

13:37.584 --> 13:39.484
-Carl's not a guy
you want to be making bets with.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.653
I mean, he's closer to a mob
boss than he is to a bookie.

13:41.655 --> 13:43.221
-So, why is Tomas up here

13:43.223 --> 13:45.423
if he's an action star
down in Peru?

13:45.425 --> 13:47.225
-He thought he could break
into the industry up here.

13:47.227 --> 13:48.893
Since he couldn't catch
a good break,

13:48.895 --> 13:50.562
he started betting on a few
things to make some money back,

13:50.564 --> 13:52.564
but the losses started
racking up pretty quickly.

13:52.566 --> 13:56.134
-So, what, we -- we find him,
tell Carl where he is?

13:56.136 --> 13:57.802
-That's usually
how it's supposed to go,

13:57.804 --> 13:59.237
but if it was that easy,

13:59.239 --> 14:00.872
I wouldn't need a partner
to back me up.

14:00.874 --> 14:03.241
People don't like being followed
around, you know?

14:03.243 --> 14:05.143
-Yeah, well...

14:05.145 --> 14:06.211
Maybe they
can choose their friends

14:06.213 --> 14:08.780
a little better then, you know?

14:08.782 --> 14:11.482
All right, who is this
and where is he allowed

14:11.484 --> 14:13.351
to be in action movies, man?

14:13.353 --> 14:15.620
-Sameer yousef --
another popular action star

14:15.622 --> 14:17.455
from sahab.
-Where's that?

14:17.457 --> 14:20.124
-A small city in Jordan.
Doesn't matter.

14:20.126 --> 14:23.328
Sameer's actually been following
in Tomas's footsteps for years.

14:23.330 --> 14:25.463
He claims he taught him
everything he knows.

14:25.465 --> 14:29.100
-So, sameer owes
Carl money, too?

14:29.102 --> 14:30.435
-I don't know.

14:30.437 --> 14:32.303
But sameer's been
seen with Tomas.

14:32.305 --> 14:34.105
He's the only connection
we have right now.

14:34.107 --> 14:36.507
So far, we don't know if Tomas
has any other friends up here,

14:36.509 --> 14:37.976
and we still don't even know
where the guy lives.

14:37.978 --> 14:40.178
-So then how are we even
supposed to find these guys?

14:40.180 --> 14:41.746
-Well, Tomas is gonna be tough,

14:41.748 --> 14:45.116
but sameer is actually a lead
in an indie action film

14:45.118 --> 14:47.018
that is now on hold 'cause
he walked off.

14:47.020 --> 14:49.020
So we're just gonna have to keep
an eye out for that production

14:49.022 --> 14:50.455
to get up and running again.

15:35.669 --> 15:38.136
-Okay, cut!

15:38.138 --> 15:39.671
-Did he just say "cut"?

15:39.673 --> 15:41.973
-I'm feeling a little hungry,
so why don't you go ahead

15:41.975 --> 15:45.476
and bring my stunt double
for now while I take a rest?

15:45.478 --> 15:46.377
Okay.

15:46.379 --> 15:48.146
-Yeah, right.

15:48.148 --> 15:49.347
Okay.
Uh, well, all right.

15:49.349 --> 15:50.815
Let's get the stunt double out.

15:50.817 --> 15:52.650
Okay, this guy's terrible, man.
What do you say

15:52.652 --> 15:55.019
we shoot the last few moves
with the stunt double?

15:55.021 --> 15:56.387
-Sure.
It's good to make sure.

15:56.389 --> 15:58.022
-Yeah?
Okay, yeah.

15:58.024 --> 16:01.225
Yeah, we're gonna take it back
a few shots, all right guys?

16:08.034 --> 16:09.300
-Hey.

16:09.302 --> 16:10.768
You know,
i could do these moves,

16:10.770 --> 16:13.037
but I wouldn't want
to stop the pace right now.

16:13.039 --> 16:14.105
-Yeah, okay.

16:14.107 --> 16:16.074
-All right.

16:16.076 --> 16:17.976
Hey, do your thing, man.

16:20.280 --> 16:21.646
-Do they look alike?

16:21.648 --> 16:23.214
-He came highly recommended.

16:23.216 --> 16:24.482
-Yeah, that's fine.

16:24.484 --> 16:25.850
But we still
have to shoot the shot.

16:25.852 --> 16:27.585
Now, how do we do
that when they don't look alike?

16:27.587 --> 16:29.821
-If you shoot it
at the right angle.

16:32.659 --> 16:35.693
-Guys, sorry about the confusion
on that last take.

16:35.695 --> 16:38.596
Let's just work on the set
of moves that we did earlier,

16:38.598 --> 16:39.831
and you guys will be great.

16:39.833 --> 16:41.332
-All right, guys.
Let's lock it down.

16:41.334 --> 16:42.834
Give me a slate.

16:42.836 --> 16:45.803
-Scene 19, take 85.

16:45.805 --> 16:47.638
-Roll camera.

16:49.743 --> 16:51.576
And action!

17:00.954 --> 17:02.854
Wow.

17:05.724 --> 17:08.492
Cut. Wow.

17:08.494 --> 17:11.029
That was incredible, man.
Huh.

17:11.031 --> 17:12.363
Man, if this guy
lost 100 pounds,

17:12.365 --> 17:14.098
you could have him as the lead.

17:14.099 --> 17:15.333
Uh, all right, guys.

17:15.335 --> 17:16.834
That's dinner.
Food's out in the truck.

17:16.836 --> 17:18.935
Let's go.

17:25.678 --> 17:27.244
-Hey, man.

17:27.247 --> 17:30.681
I think me and you, we trained
at the same martial arts school.

17:30.683 --> 17:32.016
-All right.
I'm gonna go take --

17:32.018 --> 17:33.951
-i detect a little disbelief.

17:33.953 --> 17:37.789
You're probably thinking
because I took a break time

17:37.791 --> 17:40.525
it's your time
to shine and make me look bad!

17:40.527 --> 17:41.926
-I'm just trying to do my job.

17:41.928 --> 17:44.896
If you have a problem,
talk to the director.

17:44.898 --> 17:45.963
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:45.965 --> 17:48.399
I studied 10 styles
of martial arts

17:48.401 --> 17:51.669
and I never needed
this spinning kicking stuff,

17:51.671 --> 17:55.740
just the element of surprise.

17:55.742 --> 17:59.277
Hey, what's that?

17:59.279 --> 18:03.281
That was pretty good.

18:03.283 --> 18:04.816
I'm glad you passed my test.

18:04.818 --> 18:08.152
I only surround myself
with the best talent there is.

18:08.154 --> 18:11.722
And you, my friend, are good
enough to be my stunt double.

18:11.724 --> 18:15.460
-Find someone else, asshole.
-Okay.

18:15.462 --> 18:16.828
Okay, that's fine.

18:16.830 --> 18:18.896
But just to let you know
that you won't be nothing

18:18.898 --> 18:21.666
in this industry.

18:21.668 --> 18:23.134
Nothing!

18:23.136 --> 18:24.802
-Hey, what's going on, man?

18:24.804 --> 18:26.704
Why am I seeing
Dave walk off like that?

18:26.706 --> 18:28.806
-If you can't hire
a professional stunt double --

18:28.808 --> 18:31.576
-hey, buddy.
That guy's obviously a pro.

18:31.578 --> 18:33.978
He's been doing it for years!
-Yeah?

18:33.980 --> 18:37.582
Well, y-y-your pro just
attacked me.

18:39.119 --> 18:42.186
-I can't believe this guy
is an action anywhere.

18:42.188 --> 18:43.955
I got to see his movies.

18:43.957 --> 18:45.857
-No, you don't.

18:49.395 --> 18:50.795
All right, man.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.830
Time to help
break someone's heart.

18:52.832 --> 18:54.765
Grab that folder.

19:09.782 --> 19:12.383
-Are we just gonna give her
the photos and that's it?

19:12.385 --> 19:13.751
Isn't that kind of cold?

19:13.753 --> 19:15.620
-We're not her psychiatrist.

19:15.622 --> 19:17.989
What do you want to do?

19:17.991 --> 19:20.124
-I don't know.

19:29.869 --> 19:32.770
-Who's this?
-I-I'm Josh.

19:32.772 --> 19:34.772
Um, I'm --
I'm sorry for...

19:34.774 --> 19:37.408
-Just come on inside.
I'll get your money.

19:53.493 --> 19:56.561
All right,
let me see the pictures.

20:00.500 --> 20:03.100
-Sorry, Michelle.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.823
-Hey, um...

20:25.825 --> 20:29.894
Michelle, you know,
sometimes people, you know,

20:29.896 --> 20:32.463
they've --

20:32.465 --> 20:35.032
-son of a bitch is gonna pay.

20:39.038 --> 20:40.805
-Was that normal
for her to carry a switchblade

20:40.807 --> 20:42.340
in her apron?
-I don't know.

20:42.342 --> 20:44.041
I'm hungry, though.
You hungry?

21:03.863 --> 21:06.163
-Oh, morning.
-Afternoon.

21:06.165 --> 21:07.198
-Really?

21:07.200 --> 21:08.499
-Yeah.

21:08.501 --> 21:09.800
I made you some breakfast.

21:09.802 --> 21:11.802
You might have
to heat it up a little.

21:14.140 --> 21:15.773
-Thanks.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.742
Hey, you think i
could borrow your car again?

21:17.744 --> 21:18.909
I-i-i got to get down to --

21:18.911 --> 21:20.811
-Tomas, I have to get to class

21:20.813 --> 21:22.380
and I have to work later.

21:22.382 --> 21:25.249
-Right, right.

21:25.251 --> 21:28.853
-What is it?

21:28.855 --> 21:30.388
-I was thinking, you know,

21:30.390 --> 21:32.590
you and I, we should -- need
to take a trip, you know?

21:32.592 --> 21:34.025
Like, let's get out of here,
you know?

21:34.027 --> 21:35.559
Let's do something
to break the routine.

21:35.561 --> 21:37.094
Just me and you, you know?

21:37.096 --> 21:38.863
-Uh, that would be nice,

21:38.865 --> 21:42.133
but you know I have finals
next week.

21:42.135 --> 21:43.267
But maybe after that.

21:43.269 --> 21:45.036
-Mm-hmm.

21:45.038 --> 21:49.407
-And besides, you have
to finish your movie, right?

21:49.409 --> 21:50.608
-Yeah, you're right.

21:50.610 --> 21:53.944
Yeah.
-Okay. I got to go.

22:09.929 --> 22:12.697
-Yeah, who is it?
-It's Tomas.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.786
-If you're in debt,
why don't you just use this

22:35.788 --> 22:37.455
to pay whoever you owe money to?

22:37.457 --> 22:39.557
-'Cause I think I need
a little bit more on the down

22:39.559 --> 22:41.258
before I could start
making payments.

22:41.260 --> 22:43.828
-Huh. Okay.
Same time tomorrow --

22:43.830 --> 22:46.964
you got a passport and I.D.

22:46.966 --> 22:51.068
-Okay.

22:54.407 --> 22:56.307
-Dick.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.346
-Mmm.

23:06.419 --> 23:07.818
What?

23:07.820 --> 23:09.587
Want me -- want me
to get something else?

23:09.589 --> 23:11.122
-You're -- you're --

23:11.124 --> 23:13.090
you're not even worried
about what Michelle might do

23:13.092 --> 23:16.293
to her now-ex-boyfriend?
-Why?

23:16.295 --> 23:18.295
Do you have some special place
in your heart for cheaters?

23:18.297 --> 23:21.565
-No, I -- I'm just saying,
what if she actually goes

23:21.567 --> 23:23.801
and nunchakus this guy up
or worse?

23:23.803 --> 23:25.803
-Yeah, well, she might do that.

23:25.805 --> 23:27.705
She might have done
that to the last guy.

23:27.707 --> 23:29.073
I guess we'll never know, right?

23:29.075 --> 23:32.176
Unless she pays us
to follow her.

23:32.178 --> 23:33.811
-Okay, so...

23:33.813 --> 23:36.781
You're saying
if you don't see anything, then.

23:36.783 --> 23:40.117
-Out of sight out of mind.

23:40.119 --> 23:41.752
I suggest you get used to it,
all right?

23:41.754 --> 23:43.187
Nick and I got paid
for delivering information

23:43.189 --> 23:45.823
to people,
not for what they do with it.

23:47.994 --> 23:49.527
Hang on.
I got to take this.

23:49.529 --> 23:51.095
Hello?

23:51.097 --> 23:56.267
-Welcome back to "celebrity
action rehab live!"

23:56.269 --> 23:57.468
-Did you move my stuff?

23:57.470 --> 24:00.337
-What stuff?
-My makeup bag in the bathroom.

24:00.339 --> 24:01.539
Did you move my stuff?

24:01.541 --> 24:04.708
-Why would I move --
oh, really?

24:08.648 --> 24:12.516
-What's this?
Ladies, ladies.

24:12.518 --> 24:14.318
Are we here to fight addictions

24:14.320 --> 24:16.854
or are we here
to fight each other?

24:18.624 --> 24:21.725
-Hey, you down to make
a couple extra g's tonight?

24:21.727 --> 24:23.694
-Uh, yeah.
What -- what's going on?

24:23.696 --> 24:26.130
-Uh, my buddy needs backup.

24:26.132 --> 24:28.098
-W-what does
that mean, "backup"?

24:28.100 --> 24:29.800
-Uh, we're probably just gonna
make sure he doesn't,

24:29.802 --> 24:32.102
uh -- nothing goes crazy.
Whatever.

24:32.104 --> 24:33.704
Hey, you ever see that show,

24:33.706 --> 24:35.539
"celebrity action rehab"?

24:35.541 --> 24:37.241
-No, what--
-it's stupid.

24:37.243 --> 24:42.146
-But what are we gonna do?
-Prime time slot.

24:42.148 --> 24:44.548
Let's go.
I'll tell you in the car.

24:44.550 --> 24:46.717
-W-wha--

24:46.719 --> 24:49.253
-you're real smart, bitch.

24:49.255 --> 24:51.922
-I -- I just want to know
who we're backing up.

25:00.666 --> 25:02.466
-Hey!

25:07.740 --> 25:10.641
Thanks man.

25:10.643 --> 25:13.177
Why you always messing
with my car?

25:16.315 --> 25:18.182
-Who is this?

25:38.271 --> 25:40.037
-So, what's up?
-Some guy stole a Van

25:40.039 --> 25:42.172
full of missing artwork
on the way to the museum.

25:42.174 --> 25:43.874
I've been telling him
for an hour now --

25:43.876 --> 25:46.510
three guys,
didn't really recognize them.

25:46.512 --> 25:48.245
They're probably buyers.

25:48.247 --> 25:49.947
-Okay, so, who hired you?
The museum?

25:49.949 --> 25:51.682
-No, actually,
this is the delivery company.

25:51.684 --> 25:53.684
They figure the missing Van
would be low priority

25:53.686 --> 25:54.685
for the police.

25:54.687 --> 25:56.887
-So u-haul hires bounty hunters?

25:56.889 --> 25:58.389
-Was I talking to you?

25:58.391 --> 25:59.957
-I'm just saying
it's kind of funny,

25:59.959 --> 26:01.425
a delivery company's hiring --
-if you want

26:01.427 --> 26:03.227
a cut of this money,
you better watch your mouth.

26:03.229 --> 26:06.063
-I'm not even saying anything
about you, man.

26:06.065 --> 26:08.666
-Yeah, I didn't figure
you'd want this again.

26:08.668 --> 26:10.034
-Again?

26:10.036 --> 26:11.969
You're memory's a little
altered there, buddy.

26:11.971 --> 26:13.070
-Hey, hey.
Come on.

26:13.072 --> 26:15.806
Look, we're here
to get your back,

26:15.808 --> 26:18.142
okay? Relax.

26:18.144 --> 26:20.077
Let's go.
-All right.

26:20.079 --> 26:22.479
So, anyway,
like I was saying...

26:31.757 --> 26:33.223
All right, there's four guys.

26:33.225 --> 26:35.392
They're unloading the artwork
right now.

26:41.701 --> 26:43.300
These guys are low-level.

26:43.302 --> 26:45.736
The leader looks like he's young
noir or something like that.

26:45.738 --> 26:48.038
Three guys in there look
like they're going clubbing

26:48.040 --> 26:50.074
afterwards.
-Wait, wait.

26:50.076 --> 26:51.842
How many guys
you trying to catch?

26:51.844 --> 26:53.377
-I don't know.

26:53.379 --> 26:54.812
Why don't you get a calculator
and go figure it out?

26:54.814 --> 26:57.114
-Hey, I'm just--
-so, what's the plan?

26:57.116 --> 26:58.983
-My client's paying me to get
the artwork back.

26:58.985 --> 27:00.250
The Van they sold.

27:00.252 --> 27:03.721
And whatever happens, happens.

27:03.723 --> 27:06.390
-Question -- why wouldn't
any of these guys have guns

27:06.392 --> 27:07.658
or something?
-They probably do.

27:07.660 --> 27:10.094
But if they do, then so do we.

27:10.096 --> 27:12.630
-Yeah, well, I don't.

27:12.632 --> 27:15.232
-Oh, yeah.

27:15.234 --> 27:18.969
-What did you expect, you idiot?

27:18.971 --> 27:20.437
-Don't worry about it.
There's two of us.

27:20.439 --> 27:21.438
We got your back.

27:21.440 --> 27:22.473
If people start shooting,

27:22.475 --> 27:24.074
just hang back.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:24.076 --> 27:25.476
Hang back and see
if you get a cut of the money.

27:25.478 --> 27:26.944
-Don't worry.

27:26.946 --> 27:30.280
Just do what you do.

27:30.282 --> 27:32.282
-Oh, what are they doing here?

27:32.284 --> 27:34.952
-Who?
-Those three guys in black.

27:34.954 --> 27:36.920
Those are Carl's guys.
-Oh, good.

27:36.922 --> 27:38.422
So we don't have
to worry about them?

27:38.424 --> 27:39.523
-I don't know.

27:39.525 --> 27:41.158
I'm not buddies
with them or anything.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.961
I'm just saying
i know them and they know me.

27:43.963 --> 27:45.529
-So what now?

27:45.531 --> 27:47.498
-Well, I'm guessing they're here
to do some kind of deal,

27:47.500 --> 27:49.199
and since we're trying to stop
that from happening --

27:49.201 --> 27:51.035
-all right, all right, all
right. Well, we'll see.

27:51.037 --> 27:53.537
All right, hey,
I'm gonna go take those three.

27:53.539 --> 27:56.440
-Fine.
I got the guys on the left.

27:56.442 --> 27:58.842
-W-what about the other guys?
-Okay.

27:58.844 --> 28:01.011
On three?

28:07.520 --> 28:10.988
Hey!
Everybody get on the ground!

28:13.759 --> 28:14.892
-Ken?

28:14.894 --> 28:16.126
-Hey, man.

28:16.128 --> 28:17.528
I'm just helping my buddy
with these guys.

28:17.530 --> 28:19.730
We're not here for you.
-Hey, get on the ground.

28:19.732 --> 28:21.065
-Stan, just one second.

28:21.067 --> 28:22.933
-Carl sent us here
to pick up some stuff.

28:22.935 --> 28:24.468
Think you know what that means.

28:24.470 --> 28:26.070
-Yeah, well, my buddy's here
to get that stuff back,

28:26.072 --> 28:27.604
so I'm sure you understand.

28:27.606 --> 28:29.273
I'm sure Carl will, too.

28:29.275 --> 28:30.774
-I don't think Carl likes you
as much as you think he does.

28:30.776 --> 28:32.743
-Hey, man, I'm still
working for him just like you.

28:32.745 --> 28:34.945
-Come on, guys.
Let's go.

28:39.952 --> 28:41.819
-Hey!
Why isn't dick face

28:41.821 --> 28:43.487
on the ground?
-What did you say?

28:43.489 --> 28:46.724
-I said, "why are you
on the ground, dick face?"

28:46.726 --> 28:48.792
-Stan, relax.

28:48.794 --> 28:50.294
-Guns are for pussies.

28:50.296 --> 28:53.097
And you, my friend, are a pussy.

28:53.099 --> 28:56.233
I would own you.
-Oh, would you?

28:56.235 --> 28:59.136
-Just calm down, Stan!

29:13.385 --> 29:16.053
-Oh.

29:16.055 --> 29:18.222
Whoops.

29:25.231 --> 29:27.698
Nick's substitute, right?

30:49.982 --> 30:52.082
-Thanks.

34:02.508 --> 34:05.809
-You didn't seem yourself
while you were training today.

34:05.811 --> 34:07.077
What's the problem?

34:07.079 --> 34:09.212
-This last film
i worked on didn't go too well.

34:09.214 --> 34:12.049
First the director
made a comment about my weight.

34:12.051 --> 34:15.952
-David, shape and size cannot
hide talent.

34:15.954 --> 34:17.687
It adds character,

34:17.688 --> 34:21.091
and your father
was the living proof of that.

34:21.092 --> 34:24.061
-Yeah, but he didn't try to make
it the entertainment industry.

34:24.063 --> 34:27.364
-I bet he could have
if that's what he wanted to do.

34:27.366 --> 34:29.266
Before he passed away,

34:29.268 --> 34:32.034
he did everything
he wanted to do in life.

34:32.036 --> 34:35.005
He never let anyone tell him
he couldn't do anything,

34:35.007 --> 34:37.474
like you when you first
started training with me.

34:37.476 --> 34:39.275
-That's training here with you.

34:39.277 --> 34:40.811
Out there,
it's a different world.

34:40.813 --> 34:43.246
During break, the lead
tried to pick a fight with me.

34:43.248 --> 34:44.681
-Jealous of your talent, maybe?

34:44.683 --> 34:46.583
-He seemed pretty confident
to me.

34:46.585 --> 34:48.452
-People who pick fights

34:48.454 --> 34:50.520
usually don't have someone
to fight with them,

34:50.522 --> 34:53.056
and people
who talk down to people

34:53.058 --> 34:54.757
usually need someone to listen.

34:54.760 --> 34:56.259
-So what am I supposed to do?

34:56.261 --> 34:58.495
Defend someone that wants
to fight me and lend my ear

34:58.497 --> 35:00.397
to someone that's insulted me?

35:00.399 --> 35:02.599
-Not challenging enough for you?

35:09.708 --> 35:11.508
-Hello?

35:11.510 --> 35:13.376
-Hey, David. It's frank.
-Yeah.

35:13.378 --> 35:15.679
-Yeah,
about that sameer thing, well,

35:15.681 --> 35:18.582
here's the deal --
nobody saw nothing,

35:18.584 --> 35:21.184
so unfortunately, it's
sameer's word against yours.

35:21.186 --> 35:22.385
-And what did he say?

35:22.387 --> 35:23.753
-Well, apparently he says

35:23.755 --> 35:25.388
he was talking to you
about martial arts,

35:25.390 --> 35:29.493
you somehow became offended
and attacked him.

35:29.495 --> 35:31.128
-What an asshole.

35:31.130 --> 35:33.463
-Yeah, basically he's told
everyone on set that, you know,

35:33.465 --> 35:35.365
he refuses to work
around a maniac.

35:35.367 --> 35:37.100
-So what does that mean for me?

35:37.102 --> 35:39.870
-Well, since he's the lead,

35:39.872 --> 35:42.706
they're just gonna go
with another stunt double.

35:44.476 --> 35:46.676
But, hey,
d-don't worry about it.

35:46.678 --> 35:48.445
You know,
I'll keep an eye out for you.

35:48.447 --> 35:49.946
And besides,
think about it this way --

35:49.948 --> 35:52.482
as long as people
keep eating all that fast food,

35:52.484 --> 35:54.551
you'll have work.
-Okay.

35:54.553 --> 35:56.419
-Hey, listen,
i had a breakfast burrito

35:56.421 --> 35:57.721
and that thing's working its way
through me.

35:57.723 --> 36:00.056
I got to get to a toilet fast.

36:00.058 --> 36:01.525
-Yeah. Bye.

36:01.527 --> 36:03.760
-Yeah, talk to you soon, buddy.

36:20.245 --> 36:21.845
-What's up?
-Oh, hey.

36:21.847 --> 36:25.182
How's it going?
-Who's this guy?

36:25.184 --> 36:28.218
-Uh, it's... bill

36:28.220 --> 36:30.620
-no, I'm Tony.

36:32.491 --> 36:36.860
-Might want to make sure
it's actually bill.

36:36.862 --> 36:38.195
I don't want to keep you --
you're busy --

36:38.197 --> 36:39.596
but is my dad here?

36:39.598 --> 36:41.131
-Yeah, what's up?
-Rich, Vic,

36:41.133 --> 36:44.167
and Ivan were supposed to
pick up some artwork for my dad,

36:44.169 --> 36:46.002
but they screwed it up.

36:46.004 --> 36:48.004
I can give them one more chance,
but then I have to kill

36:48.006 --> 36:49.239
all three of them.

36:49.241 --> 36:50.807
And then that's a bummer

36:50.809 --> 36:52.242
because you got to take care
of the bodies -- you know,

36:52.244 --> 36:54.344
digging all the ditches
and however you do it.

36:54.346 --> 36:55.946
It's not my -- you know what?

36:55.948 --> 36:57.747
I'll handle it.

36:57.749 --> 37:00.550
Well, see you around...

37:00.552 --> 37:02.686
William.
Um...

37:02.688 --> 37:06.389
Well, actually, I probably
won't ever see you again.

37:06.391 --> 37:08.592
But see you.

37:24.509 --> 37:26.910
-Isn't this fun? Huh?

37:26.912 --> 37:30.814
Aren't we all having fun?
Right?

37:33.218 --> 37:35.018
Silence!

37:45.497 --> 37:49.332
Rico, my old friend.

37:49.334 --> 37:52.569
-Hyena.
-I thought you were dead.

37:52.571 --> 37:56.106
-Didn't take.

37:56.108 --> 37:57.907
-Ha ha ha.

38:03.782 --> 38:05.949
-Get out of my way.

38:11.590 --> 38:13.089
-You're just in time.

38:13.091 --> 38:17.427
We're having a little party
for this bitch.

38:17.429 --> 38:21.131
-Well, you know what
they say...

38:21.133 --> 38:25.568
"It's not a bitch party
without a bitch."

38:25.570 --> 38:28.038
-Indeed.

38:28.040 --> 38:29.639
-One moment.

38:29.641 --> 38:32.575
Hyena, there's just one problem.

38:32.577 --> 38:33.843
-Yes?

38:33.845 --> 38:37.914
-This bitch is my sister.

38:50.062 --> 38:51.961
-My nuts!

38:54.399 --> 38:56.299
-Oh!

39:07.079 --> 39:09.112
-Drop the gun.

39:09.114 --> 39:12.248
I'm British.

39:12.250 --> 39:14.484
-I thought you were German.

39:14.486 --> 39:16.486
-Well, people change.

39:16.488 --> 39:18.288
Now turn around.

39:21.860 --> 39:23.259
Ha!

39:23.261 --> 39:27.630
What good is your code
of Peruvian bushido now?

39:30.902 --> 39:34.104
-It's good for this.

39:37.275 --> 39:39.876
-Rico!

39:44.149 --> 39:45.982
-Easy.
Nothing.

39:50.555 --> 39:53.123
-Oh, rico, if you weren't
my brother...

39:53.125 --> 39:56.426
-I'm not.
I'm your step-brother.

39:56.428 --> 40:00.630
-Tomas de la Cruz!

40:18.917 --> 40:23.286
Man, I know I can make it
like you did.

40:28.460 --> 40:32.262
And I'll never forget
what you told me that day.

40:32.264 --> 40:34.164
Respect.

40:49.181 --> 40:50.914
-What the hell
are you doing, man?

40:50.916 --> 40:55.452
-Sorry, Mr. de la Cruz?
I'm a huge fan of yours.

40:55.454 --> 40:57.086
I love your movies.

40:57.088 --> 41:01.057
And "multiple impact"
is such an action classic!

41:01.059 --> 41:03.426
-You -- you've seen my films?
-Yes, sir.

41:03.428 --> 41:04.928
All three.

41:04.930 --> 41:07.864
And I started acting and
studying several martial arts

41:07.866 --> 41:10.266
to be as great of an action star
as you.

41:10.268 --> 41:12.001
-R-really?
Now, see, that's funny,

41:12.003 --> 41:14.804
'cause actually I don't even
take martial arts, man.

41:14.806 --> 41:16.306
I just kind
of punch and kick people.

41:16.308 --> 41:17.507
-No way, man.

41:17.509 --> 41:19.375
You must be a natural then,

41:19.377 --> 41:23.279
because I studied 10 martial
arts to be as great as you, man.

41:23.281 --> 41:28.551
-Dang, 10?
-And I read all 10 books twice.

41:28.553 --> 41:29.819
-Oh, I see.

41:29.821 --> 41:31.855
So you read fighting books.

41:31.857 --> 41:33.923
-Yes, sir.
-Well, hey, you know what?

41:33.925 --> 41:36.392
Whatever keeps you
motivated, you know, is --

41:36.394 --> 41:37.827
is good, I guess.

41:37.829 --> 41:39.262
-Thank you.
Thank you.

41:39.264 --> 41:40.497
-Yeah, hey.

41:40.499 --> 41:42.465
-Can I take an autograph?

41:42.467 --> 41:46.536
-Uh... sure.

41:46.538 --> 41:50.507
-Can you make it out to, uh,
sameer yousef, please?

41:52.344 --> 41:54.477
I can't believe
that I just met you now.

41:54.479 --> 41:58.615
I was on my way to an audition
downtown and...

41:58.617 --> 42:01.084
This must be a sign.

42:01.086 --> 42:03.286
Unbelievable.
-There you go, man.

42:03.288 --> 42:05.622
-Thank you, sir.

42:05.624 --> 42:08.458
Can I take one picture?
Just -- just one picture?

42:08.460 --> 42:09.692
-Yeah, sure.

42:09.694 --> 42:11.761
-My friends won't believe this.

42:18.537 --> 42:23.373
All right.

42:23.375 --> 42:25.275
Yes!

42:26.978 --> 42:29.012
Hey, this is me.
-Yeah.

42:29.014 --> 42:30.413
Oh, hey, man.
You know what?

42:30.415 --> 42:31.848
I got to go.
It was really great to meet you

42:31.850 --> 42:33.750
and, uh,
take it easy, all right?

42:33.752 --> 42:35.885
-Is everything okay?

42:38.857 --> 42:41.658
-Aye!
-Hey, is something wrong?

42:41.660 --> 42:43.893
Is -- is it paparazzi?

42:43.895 --> 42:48.264
I'll create a divergence!
-What are you doing?

42:48.266 --> 42:50.333
Isn't that your --
get on the train!

42:53.738 --> 42:55.171
-Hey, Vic.
Let's get ready to move.

42:55.173 --> 42:56.472
Looks like they're getting
on this bus.

42:56.474 --> 42:58.608
-I swear,
if we lose these guys, you guys

42:58.610 --> 42:59.809
are all walking back to Carl's.

42:59.811 --> 43:01.144
-What?
Why?

43:01.146 --> 43:03.179
-'Cause you guys
keep asking me stupid questions.

43:03.181 --> 43:05.048
Let's go.

43:12.591 --> 43:14.157
-I get it.

43:14.159 --> 43:16.292
You keep pretending that people
are chasing after you

43:16.294 --> 43:18.795
so you keep your acting sharp.

43:18.797 --> 43:20.630
Wow.
-Yeah, no.

43:20.632 --> 43:21.898
It -- it helps.
It does.

43:21.900 --> 43:22.966
It helps.

43:22.968 --> 43:24.767
-Wow.
That is fantastic.

43:24.769 --> 43:27.003
Hey, can you
give me any other advice?

43:27.005 --> 43:28.304
I would really appreciate it.

43:28.306 --> 43:31.507
-Well, it's a tough business.
-Okay.

43:31.509 --> 43:33.876
-All right, there's always gonna
be some asshole trying to Jack

43:33.878 --> 43:35.712
you of your opportunities,
all right?

43:35.714 --> 43:37.380
So don't trust anybody.
-Okay.

43:37.382 --> 43:39.182
-Okay?
-Thank you. Thank you.

43:39.184 --> 43:40.750
-Yeah, I hope you
make your audition, man.

43:40.752 --> 43:43.152
-Thank you so much, sir.

43:43.154 --> 43:44.420
Hey!

43:44.422 --> 43:46.456
Hey, it's an honor!

44:04.643 --> 44:06.509
Whatever.

44:12.083 --> 44:13.549
-Man, that was a waste of time.

44:13.551 --> 44:15.618
He didn't even have a gun.
-Don't worry about it.

44:15.620 --> 44:17.553
Look, we've got snacks now.

44:23.795 --> 44:25.495
Hey, man.
You got to try these chips.

44:25.497 --> 44:28.264
-Those look like not chips,
all right?

44:28.266 --> 44:30.233
Why are we walking
through all these alleys?

44:30.235 --> 44:31.567
-I don't like to pay
for the parking.

44:31.569 --> 44:33.302
Chinatown sucks.

44:36.841 --> 44:40.777
-Man, I don't need one of those.
What I really need right now

44:40.779 --> 44:42.278
is --
-one of those?

44:42.280 --> 44:45.281
-Hey, shut up and give me
your wallets -- both of you.

44:45.283 --> 44:47.450
-Man.

44:47.452 --> 44:51.521
This is just --
-what are you doing?

44:51.523 --> 44:53.723
-I'm giving him my wallet.
-Just shut up.

44:53.725 --> 44:54.957
And you, do the same thing --

44:54.959 --> 44:59.228
wallet, now.
-No, I don't want to.

44:59.230 --> 45:00.863
-What?
-Are you crazy?

45:00.865 --> 45:02.365
-Yeah, man.
What are you, crazy?

45:02.367 --> 45:04.267
-No.

45:07.205 --> 45:08.971
Look, if I give you my wallet,
can I put

45:08.973 --> 45:10.473
these down on the ground?
-Whatever.

45:10.475 --> 45:12.542
Wallet, now.
-You know what?

45:12.544 --> 45:14.610
I don't want to do that 'cause
it smells like someone

45:14.612 --> 45:17.046
took a piss here and i
don't want to mess up my chips.

45:17.048 --> 45:19.082
So you hold this.
-Hold this?

45:19.084 --> 45:21.584
-Hold this.

45:41.439 --> 45:43.172
Look at that.

45:43.174 --> 45:45.575
-Yeah, uh,
it's a gun with no -- no clip.

45:45.577 --> 45:46.709
There's no bullets.

45:46.711 --> 45:48.644
-Always complaining.

45:48.646 --> 45:50.613
-Okay, come on, man.

45:55.120 --> 45:57.720
-So, this guy, Pete,
he makes fake I.D.S

45:57.722 --> 46:01.390
-yeah, there's only a few guys
that are really pro.

46:15.039 --> 46:18.207
Right there -- white door.

46:18.209 --> 46:19.942
-So, what?
We just wait?

46:19.944 --> 46:22.044
-Yep.
-All right.

46:42.600 --> 46:45.635
-Hello?
-I told you weren't out of it.

46:45.637 --> 46:46.803
-What's up?

46:46.805 --> 46:48.404
-New martial arts film casting

46:48.406 --> 46:50.573
for an overweight actor
who can throw a couple of kicks

46:50.575 --> 46:52.909
and they don't care
what you look like.

46:52.911 --> 46:56.512
Now who's the man?

47:00.518 --> 47:02.852
-Live!
-What am I gonna do?

47:02.854 --> 47:04.787
Take drugs through my phone?
Is there an app for that?

47:04.789 --> 47:07.356
What right do you have to take
my phone from me anyway?

47:07.358 --> 47:09.458
-It's part of the agreement
that all patients

47:09.460 --> 47:10.893
make when they're receiving
treatment here.

47:10.895 --> 47:13.596
Attacking the nurse is not
the way to deal --

47:13.598 --> 47:15.965
-attacking?
-You stomped on her foot.

47:15.967 --> 47:17.466
-I'm sorry, okay?

47:17.468 --> 47:19.669
-After you apologize
to the right nurse.

47:19.671 --> 47:22.271
-Okay, fine!

47:22.273 --> 47:23.506
-Okay, stop it right there.

47:23.508 --> 47:25.908
Take it back a couple
of seconds.

47:25.910 --> 47:28.344
-Yeah, what am I gonna do?
Take drugs through my phone?

47:28.346 --> 47:29.745
Is there an app for that?

47:29.747 --> 47:32.014
-Okay, right when she
says "i hate this place,"

47:32.016 --> 47:33.382
I want you to cut to her crying

47:33.384 --> 47:34.784
while she's talking
about her dad's abuse.

47:34.786 --> 47:36.619
And then I want you to cut back
to her

47:36.621 --> 47:38.421
talking to Amy saying "I've
never had a friend like you,"

47:38.423 --> 47:41.357
and then I want you to cut to
her slapping Amy.

47:41.359 --> 47:43.192
I think that's gonna
play out really nicely.

47:43.194 --> 47:45.361
-Yeah, no problem.

47:45.363 --> 47:48.064
- Hello?

47:48.066 --> 47:50.433
-Hi, amera?
-Yeah.

47:50.435 --> 47:52.068
-Shelley's not working well
with us.

47:52.070 --> 47:54.003
She's getting increasingly
violent.

47:54.005 --> 47:57.807
-Yeah, and you've been doing
such an amazing job with her.

47:57.809 --> 47:59.408
-Take your bad shoes and go out!

47:59.410 --> 48:01.043
-I'm placing a request
to transfer to --

48:01.045 --> 48:03.646
-oh -- oh, wait, wait, wait.
No, you can't do that.

48:03.648 --> 48:06.449
Our ratings have gone way up
since she joined the show.

48:06.451 --> 48:08.584
-You know, my contract
says I have the right

48:08.586 --> 48:11.254
to treat these patients
as I see fit.

48:11.256 --> 48:15.725
-Okay. No problem at all.
Thank you.

48:15.727 --> 48:18.194
-You are wasting my time.

48:18.196 --> 48:20.396
Did you not hear me?
-It's looking good.

48:20.398 --> 48:23.466
-What is wrong with you?
Out! Out!

48:23.468 --> 48:25.735
-We really need to find somebody
to replace shelley

48:25.737 --> 48:27.637
before she goes.

48:34.779 --> 48:36.679
-Are you insane?

48:36.681 --> 48:40.016
-I was just showing him
how to do the moves properly.

48:40.018 --> 48:42.985
-Proper-- y-you hit the guy
in the back of the head

48:42.987 --> 48:44.654
with a wooden sword!

48:44.656 --> 48:46.656
How are you gonna hit him
in the back of the head

48:46.658 --> 48:48.357
if he's supposed
to be watching you?

48:48.359 --> 48:50.226
-Hey, I took it upon myself

48:50.228 --> 48:52.428
to make sure
that he does his job right,

48:52.430 --> 48:54.964
which you guys apparently
screwed it up again.

48:54.966 --> 48:57.700
-Well, apparently I don't think
this went down the way

48:57.702 --> 48:58.734
you say it did,

48:58.736 --> 49:01.837
because you're obviously
a no-talent poser

49:01.839 --> 49:04.373
who was suggested to me
by a casting director

49:04.375 --> 49:05.641
that I'm never gonna use again.

49:05.643 --> 49:07.176
Huh?
What was her name again?

49:07.178 --> 49:09.111
Was it your cousin?
Huh?

49:09.113 --> 49:11.948
-Well, you can't fire me unless
you're gonna re-shoot everything

49:11.950 --> 49:14.450
I just did, which is gonna
end up costing you.

49:14.452 --> 49:16.118
-I'll be just fine.
Thanks, man.

49:16.120 --> 49:18.888
But you can expect a lawsuit
from this guy when he wakes up.

49:18.890 --> 49:23.225
Now get the hell off my set.

49:23.227 --> 49:24.794
All right, guys.

49:24.796 --> 49:27.196
I guess we'll finish these
scenes when this guy's okay.

49:27.198 --> 49:30.800
And we'll do the pickups when we
find a new actor, all right?

49:30.802 --> 49:32.835
Now let's -- let's start
setting up, guys.

49:32.837 --> 49:34.270
-Okay, I'm gonna
give you one last --

49:34.272 --> 49:37.073
-get the hell of my set,
you maniac!

49:37.075 --> 49:38.107
-Okay, you know what?

49:38.109 --> 49:39.575
You're making a mistake.

49:39.577 --> 49:42.211
You're firing
the next Tomas de la Cruz!

49:42.213 --> 49:43.412
-Who?

49:43.414 --> 49:47.149
All right, somebody
call the police.

49:47.151 --> 49:49.618
-This is bullshit!

49:51.923 --> 49:54.690
-Hey, w-when can I get bullets
for this thing?

49:54.692 --> 49:56.025
I mean, what is the point --
-wait, wait, wait, wait,

49:56.027 --> 49:58.394
wait, wait.
There he is.

50:00.798 --> 50:01.797
-So what do we do?

50:01.799 --> 50:03.399
Do we -- do we call Carl
now or what?

50:03.401 --> 50:04.867
-No, no, no, no.

50:04.869 --> 50:07.069
He's gonna be in an out
and on his way.

50:07.071 --> 50:08.637
So we'll just wait right here

50:08.639 --> 50:10.639
and then follow him
to wherever he's staying.

50:17.682 --> 50:19.582
-Thanks.

50:25.923 --> 50:29.625
-Oh.
Here we go.

51:22.213 --> 51:25.614
-Hello?
-Yeah, we found Tomas.

51:25.616 --> 51:28.717
He's at 2135 green street.

51:28.719 --> 51:31.020
It's an apartment building.
-Nice going, Kenny.

51:31.022 --> 51:32.988
-Uh, we tailed him from a guy
who makes fake I.D.S,

51:32.990 --> 51:35.391
so I'm guessing he's not
gonna be here for very long.

51:35.393 --> 51:36.926
-I'll have some guys there soon.

51:36.928 --> 51:38.828
-All right.

51:42.767 --> 51:48.037
-Last chance,
then you're digging ditches.

51:48.039 --> 51:50.306
Change first, but whatever.

51:50.308 --> 51:51.640
-What happens now?

51:51.642 --> 51:53.109
-Well,
he's sending some guys over,

51:53.111 --> 51:55.878
so all we got to do is make sure
Tomas doesn't leave.

52:12.563 --> 52:14.296
-See that dude in front there?

52:14.298 --> 52:16.298
That's that prick
i was talking about.

52:16.300 --> 52:17.766
-Oh, rich?

52:21.639 --> 52:23.672
That little guy in the middle?
-Yeah?

52:23.674 --> 52:26.575
-He's been wanting
to fight me since day one.

52:26.577 --> 52:29.245
I don't know
what his problem is.

52:29.247 --> 52:32.448
-I almost feel bad
that we're helping these guys.

52:38.256 --> 52:39.788
-Listen, um...

52:39.790 --> 52:42.958
I'm probably not gonna be
seeing you again anytime soon.

52:45.897 --> 52:47.796
-What do you mean?

52:52.069 --> 52:54.303
God, whatever, Tomas.
You know what?

52:54.305 --> 52:58.307
You're being just like any other
guy with your bullshit.

52:58.309 --> 52:59.742
-Will you just wait a second?
-No.

52:59.744 --> 53:01.110
I will not wait a second.

53:01.112 --> 53:03.779
And I will not wait
for your explanation.

53:06.350 --> 53:07.983
I got to admit, though.

53:07.985 --> 53:11.220
I have never heard the "bookie's
after me for $15,000" excuse.

53:11.222 --> 53:12.688
Lame.

53:12.690 --> 53:14.356
-I really wish you'd just
listen to me for a second.

53:23.834 --> 53:26.202
-Yeah?
Can I help you guys?

53:26.204 --> 53:30.940
-No, but he can.
-Okay.

53:30.942 --> 53:32.508
All right, all right, all right.
You know what?

53:32.510 --> 53:34.043
Just -- can we take
this outside?

53:34.045 --> 53:36.412
-Why? Is that
where you keep your money?

53:36.414 --> 53:37.780
-I don't have it right now,
all right?

53:37.782 --> 53:39.281
But I'm gonna get it.
-Why don't you just

53:39.283 --> 53:40.849
call your buddy here
and have him bring it instead?

53:40.851 --> 53:42.685
-My buddy?
-We saw you guys last week

53:42.687 --> 53:44.753
by the piers.
You were giving him something.

53:44.755 --> 53:47.056
-That's not my buddy, all right.

53:47.058 --> 53:51.560
That's just some fan
who wanted an autograph.

53:51.562 --> 53:53.696
-Can we get your autograph, too?

53:53.698 --> 53:56.365
-All right, this is crazy.
I'm gonna call the police.

53:56.367 --> 53:58.567
-Aw, now
why you got to go do that?

54:29.100 --> 54:31.734
-So, how long's it take
three punks to kick the crap

54:31.736 --> 54:33.669
out of one action star?

54:50.321 --> 54:53.555
-What?
Let's go.

55:04.001 --> 55:05.768
-What do we do?
What do we do?

55:05.770 --> 55:07.670
What do we do?
-Call an ambulance.

55:31.696 --> 55:34.330
-Yeah, yeah...

55:47.712 --> 55:52.014
-Hey!
Who you calling? Huh?

55:52.016 --> 55:54.950
-You gonna come
kick this phone away from me?

55:54.952 --> 55:56.752
-What if I do?
-See what happens.

55:59.290 --> 56:01.990
-I'll get you later.

56:37.862 --> 56:42.698
-Welcome back to "celebrity
action rehab live!"

56:42.700 --> 56:44.833
-Now we will meditate
to the music

56:44.835 --> 56:48.103
as our anger
and tension melt away.

56:49.940 --> 56:52.708
-Guess who I saw yesterday.
-Who did you see?

56:52.710 --> 56:55.043
-Sylvester wonton.
-No way.

56:55.045 --> 56:57.112
-Oh, what was the name
of that last movie he did?

56:57.114 --> 56:59.081
-"Garbage man."
-Did anybody go see that?

56:59.083 --> 57:01.316
-Yeah, I did.
It was like being a tampon

57:01.318 --> 57:03.986
in a heavy flow,
but you needed another one.

57:03.988 --> 57:05.721
I needed to call for backup.

57:05.723 --> 57:08.724
-Well, Ivan's dead.

57:08.726 --> 57:10.793
I can't kill rich and Vic now.

57:10.795 --> 57:13.695
Not -- "let's all three
of them," you know?

57:13.697 --> 57:16.165
It doesn't feel right.

57:16.167 --> 57:20.769
They're like the three brothers,
the three amigos,

57:20.771 --> 57:23.138
three compadres.

57:23.140 --> 57:26.175
-And when I started bugging him,
he got pissed at me 'cause

57:26.177 --> 57:27.443
his friend died.

57:27.445 --> 57:29.511
And I'm like, "am I supposed
to care about that?"

57:29.513 --> 57:30.646
He'd be perfect for the show.

57:30.648 --> 57:32.748
-I'll be right back.

57:47.865 --> 57:49.932
Are you just stupid?

57:49.934 --> 57:52.801
Is that what the problem is?

57:52.803 --> 57:53.969
-He put Manny in the hospital.

57:53.971 --> 57:55.504
He just threw Ivan
out of a window.

57:55.506 --> 57:58.207
-So you thought, "kill
this guy -- an eye for an eye.

57:58.209 --> 57:59.641
Cover your tracks
really well

57:59.643 --> 58:00.876
and everything
will be just fine?"

58:00.878 --> 58:04.346
Never mind the 15 grand,

58:04.348 --> 58:06.181
so long as you teach someone
a lesson?

58:06.183 --> 58:08.484
That's what the goal is here?
-He just killed Ivan.

58:08.486 --> 58:11.420
-Ivan was a prick
and he slept with your sister.

58:11.422 --> 58:12.855
Ask him.

58:14.058 --> 58:15.157
-Why don't you
speak English --

58:15.159 --> 58:16.558
-hey, why don't you shut up

58:16.560 --> 58:19.094
or I'll kill you right here?
How about that?

58:19.096 --> 58:20.562
-Look, let
me just explain to Carl, okay?

58:20.564 --> 58:24.199
-I said shut up or I will drop
you in the street.

58:24.201 --> 58:26.635
You're not explaining anything
to my dad.

58:26.637 --> 58:29.438
In fact, he doesn't want you
anywhere near his curb.

58:29.440 --> 58:31.406
Here's what you two
are gonna do -- you're gonna

58:31.408 --> 58:34.710
find Ken and his little buddy
and you're gonna follow them

58:34.712 --> 58:36.111
wherever they go.

58:36.113 --> 58:38.113
And you better hope
Ken finds sameer,

58:38.115 --> 58:40.983
and you really better hope
sameer has that money

58:40.985 --> 58:42.951
you're so sure he has.

58:42.953 --> 58:44.353
-What if Ken
doesn't find anything?

58:44.355 --> 58:47.356
-Did I not tell him to shut up
or I'll kill him?

58:47.358 --> 58:52.094
Do not speak in my presence
any more.

58:52.096 --> 58:53.829
Find Ken.

58:53.831 --> 58:56.698
Then your life
depends on him finding sameer.

58:56.700 --> 58:59.968
And you,
call me when it's an order.

59:04.341 --> 59:05.541
Or a text.

59:05.543 --> 59:08.143
Shoot me a text.

59:08.145 --> 59:10.279
Go.

59:34.838 --> 59:36.438
-Aren't you tired?

59:36.440 --> 59:40.842
-I haven't pulled an all-nighter
in a long time, you know?

59:40.844 --> 59:42.511
-If you want to take off
and get some rest,

59:42.513 --> 59:45.581
it's cool with me if you don't
mind walking or taking a bus.

59:48.919 --> 59:50.986
-All right.

59:57.561 --> 59:59.227
Hey, listen, man.

59:59.229 --> 01:00:01.463
Um, I don't know what you're
planning on doing now, but I --

01:00:01.465 --> 01:00:06.468
I don't think I can help you
find that other guy for Carl.

01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:09.972
I-i didn't expect this job
to be like this.

01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:18.914
-Hello?
-Kenny, my man.

01:00:18.916 --> 01:00:20.349
Excellent work last night.

01:00:20.351 --> 01:00:22.217
My pops sent over Doe
with the payment.

01:00:22.219 --> 01:00:24.820
I hope Tomas's fan
won't be too hard to find.

01:00:24.822 --> 01:00:26.388
-Yeah, shouldn't be a problem.

01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:27.422
-Great.

01:00:27.424 --> 01:00:28.624
-Okay, thank you.

01:00:28.626 --> 01:00:32.561
-No, thank you.

01:00:32.563 --> 01:00:36.064
-Carl put double payment
in my drop box.

01:00:36.066 --> 01:00:38.333
-You won't have
to worry about rent for months.

01:00:41.205 --> 01:00:42.437
What?

01:00:42.439 --> 01:00:45.907
-I just -- I don't know
how I feel about that.

01:00:45.909 --> 01:00:48.710
-What happened
to honorable judge Josh?

01:00:48.712 --> 01:00:51.113
Didn't Tomas deserve this?

01:00:51.115 --> 01:00:52.714
Doesn't sameer deserve his, too?

01:00:52.716 --> 01:00:54.149
Because --
-yeah,

01:00:54.151 --> 01:00:55.684
I said that people
should choose their friends

01:00:55.686 --> 01:00:57.552
better if their friends
get them into trouble,

01:00:57.554 --> 01:01:01.456
but I don't want somebody
to die just to prove my point.

01:01:01.458 --> 01:01:05.260
I don't want
anybody dying for anything.

01:01:05.262 --> 01:01:07.162
I mean, maybe to you, Stan,
and Nick,

01:01:07.164 --> 01:01:08.864
this is
like normal everyday --

01:01:08.866 --> 01:01:12.234
-this isn't normal for me, okay?

01:01:12.236 --> 01:01:13.635
I've been doing this
for a few years now,

01:01:13.637 --> 01:01:16.138
and besides Carl's guys
roughing up a few people

01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:17.606
here and there,
the worst I've ever seen

01:01:17.608 --> 01:01:19.975
is some property damage
or a few broken hearts.

01:01:19.977 --> 01:01:22.577
Everything else was for show.

01:01:22.579 --> 01:01:24.379
All the clients Nick
and I've had,

01:01:24.381 --> 01:01:27.683
talking about getting back
at people,

01:01:27.685 --> 01:01:29.284
nothing has ever gone this far.

01:01:29.286 --> 01:01:32.254
-Well, that's what I'm saying,
man, I just --

01:01:32.256 --> 01:01:34.856
I don't think I could continue
this case with you

01:01:34.858 --> 01:01:39.027
if it's gonna go that far.

01:01:39.029 --> 01:01:41.196
-Well, me neither.

01:01:41.198 --> 01:01:43.498
I get what you're saying.

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:45.834
I just feel like if i
don't get to sameer first,

01:01:45.836 --> 01:01:47.936
somebody else will.

01:01:47.938 --> 01:01:51.740
So, if you want to help,

01:01:51.742 --> 01:01:53.442
I could use it.

01:01:53.444 --> 01:01:56.044
But if not,
hey, I understand.

01:02:02.052 --> 01:02:04.052
-All right, wait, wait, wait.

01:02:22.539 --> 01:02:24.806
-Hey, come see this.

01:02:24.808 --> 01:02:29.678
-The death of Tomas de la Cruz.

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:31.379
In the life after death...

01:02:31.381 --> 01:02:33.315
-Hey, guys.
What's going on?

01:02:33.317 --> 01:02:35.183
-Hey, I'm just showing her
this guy's web blogs.

01:02:35.185 --> 01:02:36.485
He's supposedly an action star

01:02:36.487 --> 01:02:38.053
from the middle east
or something.

01:02:38.055 --> 01:02:39.821
And he's all depressed
about his idol's murder.

01:02:39.823 --> 01:02:40.822
It's got to be a joke.

01:02:40.824 --> 01:02:42.090
My friend worked as a P.A.

01:02:42.092 --> 01:02:43.725
On an indie film this guy
was a star of,

01:02:43.727 --> 01:02:46.228
and he supposedly fought on-set
with his own stunt double.

01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:47.496
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:02:47.498 --> 01:02:48.730
Do you want to see
him talk about it?

01:02:48.732 --> 01:02:50.165
It's hilarious.
-Yeah.

01:02:50.167 --> 01:02:51.833
Actually, does he have
any contact information

01:02:51.835 --> 01:02:53.835
on his channel?

01:02:53.837 --> 01:02:56.671
-They're gonna be my road hunt.

01:02:59.376 --> 01:03:03.211
-So, again, for the camera,
if you don't mind.

01:03:03.213 --> 01:03:07.249
-Okay, after doing a long set

01:03:07.251 --> 01:03:09.651
of some fight choreography
that I did.

01:03:09.653 --> 01:03:11.052
So I walk off and --

01:03:11.054 --> 01:03:13.588
and I'm going straight
to grab my water bottle,

01:03:13.590 --> 01:03:14.723
and here he comes --

01:03:14.725 --> 01:03:17.759
David -- walks straight up
with an attitude.

01:03:17.761 --> 01:03:19.161
Walking, he looks at me

01:03:19.163 --> 01:03:21.797
and he goes...

01:03:28.272 --> 01:03:30.205
And he does these faces.

01:03:30.207 --> 01:03:33.575
And I'm wondering,
"why you want to do that, bro?

01:03:33.577 --> 01:03:35.844
Come on,
this is professional work."

01:03:35.846 --> 01:03:37.179
Anyhow, so I let it go

01:03:37.181 --> 01:03:38.747
because I'm a bigger man
than that.

01:03:38.749 --> 01:03:41.183
-We have to find this guy David
and bring him in here.

01:03:42.886 --> 01:03:44.319
Hey.

01:03:44.321 --> 01:03:46.421
-And I just kind of pushed
him to congratulate him.

01:03:46.423 --> 01:03:48.623
-Yeah, can you get me
some information on the stuntman

01:03:48.625 --> 01:03:52.494
named David palatnikov?
Yeah. Thanks.

01:03:52.496 --> 01:03:54.196
-Drinking my water,
minding my own business,

01:03:54.198 --> 01:03:57.098
and after the set is done,
he walks up, right?

01:03:57.100 --> 01:04:01.369
And -- and he's walking towards
me still with an attitude.

01:04:01.371 --> 01:04:02.871
-Are you out of your damn mind,
son?

01:04:02.873 --> 01:04:05.140
You don't get your hands dirty.
Call him now!

01:04:05.142 --> 01:04:07.042
-All right,
all right!

01:04:07.044 --> 01:04:10.312
Just really creeps me out.

01:04:10.314 --> 01:04:12.514
He wants me to call Kyle.

01:04:12.516 --> 01:04:14.783
Yeah, I know.
Creeps me out, too.

01:04:34.404 --> 01:04:37.906
-Hey, Sam.
How's your dad?

01:04:37.908 --> 01:04:40.475
-Hey, at least we tried, right?

01:04:40.477 --> 01:04:43.511
We can't find sameer,
maybe nobody else can.

01:04:43.513 --> 01:04:46.081
-Yeah, maybe he left town
or something.

01:04:46.083 --> 01:04:48.183
-Yeah.

01:04:53.257 --> 01:04:54.789
-Got to take a piss.

01:04:54.791 --> 01:04:58.393
-Welcome back to "celebrity
action rehab live!"

01:04:58.395 --> 01:04:59.861
-Good afternoon, everyone.

01:04:59.863 --> 01:05:02.797
I'd like to welcome
sameer yousef to our group.

01:05:02.799 --> 01:05:07.669
It'd be great if we could all
begin with a brief introduction.

01:05:07.671 --> 01:05:10.372
-Yeah, I'm Jimmy,

01:05:10.374 --> 01:05:14.009
and this is moe moe.

01:05:14.011 --> 01:05:16.111
-Sorry, I need the music
for my rage.

01:05:16.113 --> 01:05:18.146
-No problem.
Nice to meet you.

01:05:18.148 --> 01:05:20.148
-So, what brought you here?

01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:21.950
-Samantha,
can you just say "hello"

01:05:21.952 --> 01:05:23.919
and tell him your name?

01:05:23.921 --> 01:05:25.387
-Hello.

01:05:25.389 --> 01:05:28.156
And, uh, he just said my name.

01:05:28.158 --> 01:05:29.691
-Hello.

01:05:29.693 --> 01:05:33.128
-Sameer, would you care
to share your story with us?

01:05:33.130 --> 01:05:36.231
-Sure. Um...

01:05:42.039 --> 01:05:43.505
-He actually got on that show.

01:05:43.507 --> 01:05:45.740
It's not gonna take long
for Carl's guys to find him.

01:05:45.742 --> 01:05:46.908
-Okay.

01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:47.876
-Can we stop at a bullet store
on the way?

01:05:47.878 --> 01:05:49.744
-Not now.

01:05:53.583 --> 01:05:56.184
Let me make a call real quick.

01:05:56.186 --> 01:05:58.053
Hey, Stan.
Yeah, we found the guy.

01:05:58.055 --> 01:05:59.888
Are you still down?
Okay.

01:05:59.890 --> 01:06:01.389
Thanks, man.

01:06:01.391 --> 01:06:03.191
-What's up?
-I told him back in the diner

01:06:03.193 --> 01:06:04.459
that we're gonna
go after sameer.

01:06:04.461 --> 01:06:06.695
-So, what,
he's gonna back us up now?

01:06:06.697 --> 01:06:09.130
-Sort of.

01:06:09.132 --> 01:06:12.934
-Did you meditate today?

01:06:12.936 --> 01:06:14.402
-Yeah, it's good.

01:06:14.404 --> 01:06:16.805
No one was around, so I, uh,
popped in my jet li DVDs

01:06:16.807 --> 01:06:19.341
and just lathered up
with some oil

01:06:19.343 --> 01:06:21.476
and just really relaxed.

01:06:23.814 --> 01:06:25.113
-Hello?

01:06:25.115 --> 01:06:27.716
-Hi, this is David palatnikov.
I got your message.

01:06:27.718 --> 01:06:29.551
I believe you have some work
for me.

01:06:29.553 --> 01:06:30.986
-David.

01:06:30.988 --> 01:06:33.588
Is it possible for you to meet
us at the shooting location?

01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:35.190
I'll text you the address.

01:06:35.192 --> 01:06:36.791
-Okay, yeah.
I'll head on over.

01:06:36.793 --> 01:06:37.926
Thank you.

01:06:37.928 --> 01:06:39.794
-Great.

01:06:58.415 --> 01:07:00.215
-Yep?
-Hey, Mike.

01:07:00.217 --> 01:07:02.217
-Yep?
-I have a David palatnikov

01:07:02.219 --> 01:07:04.019
coming over there right now.

01:07:04.021 --> 01:07:07.288
I need you to get a camera
on him and on sameer asap.

01:07:07.290 --> 01:07:09.457
-You got it.
-Okay.

01:07:12.362 --> 01:07:15.597
-Hey.
-So, good stuff so far today?

01:07:15.599 --> 01:07:19.334
-I got some hilarious footage
of the new guy.

01:07:19.336 --> 01:07:21.036
-Awesome.
Thank you.

01:07:21.038 --> 01:07:22.771
I'm gonna go welcome David
to the house.

01:07:22.773 --> 01:07:25.473
He should be here any minute.
-I'm ready for him.

01:07:25.475 --> 01:07:26.541
-I'll send him
in when he gets here.

01:07:26.543 --> 01:07:28.243
-Okay, sounds good.

01:07:28.245 --> 01:07:30.445
-And make sure that Mike
has a new tape.

01:07:30.447 --> 01:07:32.680
-I just did that.
-Is Dr. Derek around?

01:07:32.682 --> 01:07:35.016
-No, he just left. He probably
won't be back for a while.

01:07:35.018 --> 01:07:36.251
-Okay, good.

01:07:36.253 --> 01:07:38.119
I need you to keep an eye out
for him.

01:07:38.121 --> 01:07:39.754
And if he comes back any sooner,

01:07:39.756 --> 01:07:41.256
we might need to stall him.
-Okay.

01:07:41.258 --> 01:07:42.791
I can do that.

01:07:42.793 --> 01:07:43.725
Oh, hey, Marty.

01:07:47.697 --> 01:07:52.267
-I mean, you guys
have seen "fist of won," right?

01:07:52.269 --> 01:07:55.403
It's Tomas de la Cruz's
best movie, man.

01:07:55.405 --> 01:07:56.471
-Yeah, keep going, man.

01:07:56.473 --> 01:07:57.939
I'm listening.

01:07:57.941 --> 01:08:00.108
-And I really don't know
why people keep giving me

01:08:00.110 --> 01:08:02.710
a hard time for loving the guy.

01:08:02.712 --> 01:08:04.412
I just want to carry on
his legacy.

01:08:04.414 --> 01:08:07.816
I mean, he made amazing
action movies...

01:08:08.952 --> 01:08:12.654
So, I did meet the guy --
which was crazy.

01:08:12.656 --> 01:08:14.456
Next thing I know, he's dead.

01:08:14.458 --> 01:08:16.390
And the woman
who contacted me said she wants

01:08:16.393 --> 01:08:18.493
me to be on this show
to pay tribute to him,

01:08:18.495 --> 01:08:20.728
but I haven't had the chance
to do so yet.

01:08:20.729 --> 01:08:23.765
And I still don't know
why I'm here.

01:08:23.767 --> 01:08:27.402
But I do like that you guys
do listen to me.

01:08:27.404 --> 01:08:29.237
-Yeah, man.
It's what we're here for.

01:08:29.238 --> 01:08:33.174
-Thank you, man.

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:40.915
-Because he always
forgets that, too.

01:08:40.917 --> 01:08:42.716
And don't worry
about calling for Marty

01:08:42.719 --> 01:08:44.551
unless there's a real problem.

01:08:44.554 --> 01:08:46.955
We need to let Mike
get enough footage of David

01:08:46.957 --> 01:08:48.256
and sameer's reunion.

01:08:48.258 --> 01:08:50.558
-I got to go.
David's here.

01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:53.728
-This is gonna be great.

01:08:56.032 --> 01:08:57.365
-Hi, I'm David.

01:08:57.367 --> 01:08:59.367
Amera sent me here
to work on a project.

01:08:59.368 --> 01:09:01.136
-Come on in.
-All right.

01:09:05.475 --> 01:09:07.774
-We got to get in
before the gate closes.

01:09:13.416 --> 01:09:14.883
-Just park
where you see the other cars

01:09:14.885 --> 01:09:16.451
and take the path
up to the house.

01:09:16.453 --> 01:09:20.154
-Hey, uh...

01:09:20.157 --> 01:09:22.924
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is private property.

01:09:22.926 --> 01:09:23.892
You need to leave.

01:09:23.894 --> 01:09:26.661
-Yeah, we need to get in there.

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:28.897
Um...
Want to help me here, man?

01:09:35.772 --> 01:09:37.604
-There's a guy in your cast

01:09:37.607 --> 01:09:39.174
or whatever you call it --
he's in there

01:09:39.176 --> 01:09:40.841
and he's in some big trouble
with some very bad people.

01:09:40.844 --> 01:09:42.410
We're just gonna go in and --

01:09:42.412 --> 01:09:46.848
-everyone here is probably
in trouble with bad people.

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:55.790
-Allow the music to soothe you.

01:09:55.792 --> 01:10:00.361
-He pretended he didn't
Tomas de la Cruz.

01:10:00.363 --> 01:10:02.730
I wanted to test
my stunt double

01:10:02.732 --> 01:10:06.267
to see if he's capable
of doing this difficult move.

01:10:06.269 --> 01:10:08.736
You know how it is, right?

01:10:25.355 --> 01:10:26.988
-Why are we wasting time?

01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:28.389
Let's -- look,
we're gonna go in.

01:10:28.391 --> 01:10:29.490
You can do
what ever you need to.

01:10:29.492 --> 01:10:32.694
-No.
No, I don't think so.

01:10:32.696 --> 01:10:36.030
-Marty?
Can you come down here, please?

01:10:43.573 --> 01:10:46.474
-Let's just jump this fence.

01:11:07.897 --> 01:11:09.230
-Hell no.

01:11:09.232 --> 01:11:12.166
-You ruined my career and now
you're here to rub it in?

01:11:20.543 --> 01:11:23.678
- Beginner moves.

01:11:26.283 --> 01:11:27.749
Who are you guys?

01:11:27.751 --> 01:11:29.684
-We're friends of Tomas.
-What?

01:11:29.686 --> 01:11:33.021
-Well, the last ones to hang out
with him, anyway.

01:11:33.023 --> 01:11:35.156
He was a real asshole,
wasn't he?

01:11:35.158 --> 01:11:38.693
-Any enemy of Tomas
is an enemy of mine.

01:11:41.898 --> 01:11:43.498
-Sameer?

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:45.600
Everything all right?

01:11:49.706 --> 01:11:53.074
-As rage becomes calm...

01:11:53.076 --> 01:11:55.243
-Get his legs.

01:12:04.988 --> 01:12:07.855
-Hey, sameer?

01:12:11.628 --> 01:12:13.661
-What is that?
A stick?

01:12:13.663 --> 01:12:15.697
-Yeah.
That's gonna hurt.

01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:19.167
-You go first.
-Me?

01:12:19.169 --> 01:12:20.968
You're the one
that wanted to come in.

01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:40.221
-Gonna say something?

01:12:40.223 --> 01:12:42.724
There's somebody in that house
who could be in a lot of trouble

01:12:42.726 --> 01:12:44.559
very soon.

01:12:44.561 --> 01:12:46.327
We just want to help him out.

01:13:27.036 --> 01:13:30.805
-Man, what is --
what's going on down here?

01:13:39.549 --> 01:13:42.750
-Hey, Marty? You might want to
come up here soon.

01:13:42.752 --> 01:13:45.253
-He's busy, Mike.
-Okay, whatever.

01:13:47.490 --> 01:13:49.857
-Relax and --

01:14:58.828 --> 01:15:00.928
- no!

01:15:24.821 --> 01:15:28.322
Moe moe!
No!

01:15:30.660 --> 01:15:34.161
Let me go.
Fight me one-on-one.

01:15:43.673 --> 01:15:46.073
David! David!
Help me out, man.

01:15:46.075 --> 01:15:48.776
I'll handle these fools.

01:16:24.247 --> 01:16:26.414
-I got him! Get the guns!
Get the guns!

01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:34.121
Hit him, don't shoot him!
Hit him! Hit him!

01:16:38.328 --> 01:16:41.495
-His head broke your --
broke your gun.

01:16:41.497 --> 01:16:44.065
-What'd you use my gun for?

01:16:44.067 --> 01:16:46.500
-I don't know, how am i
supposed to know which gun --

01:16:46.502 --> 01:16:47.802
-you're the one --

01:16:47.804 --> 01:16:49.236
-can't I put your bullets
in my gun?

01:16:49.238 --> 01:16:51.138
-No.

01:16:53.910 --> 01:16:56.010
-You all right, man?

01:17:01.050 --> 01:17:03.117
Hey, man.
Are you all right?

01:17:04.487 --> 01:17:06.120
-Wait, where'd he go?

01:17:06.122 --> 01:17:08.022
-Oh, those two guys
you were fighting

01:17:08.024 --> 01:17:10.157
just wrapped him up in a carpet
and took off.

01:17:10.159 --> 01:17:13.260
-When?
-Just now.

01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:22.536
-What the...

01:17:33.516 --> 01:17:34.949
-Hey.
Hey, man.

01:17:34.951 --> 01:17:36.484
Are you okay?
-Yeah.

01:17:36.486 --> 01:17:38.653
Two guys in black.
They took someone.

01:17:38.655 --> 01:17:40.554
-Ah, let me guess who.

01:17:40.556 --> 01:17:42.590
-Sameer?
-Yeah.

01:17:42.592 --> 01:17:43.891
How'd you know?

01:17:43.893 --> 01:17:45.159
-Man, how'd he get by us?

01:17:45.161 --> 01:17:46.861
Is there like a back road
or something?

01:17:46.863 --> 01:17:48.429
-Well, let's go.
Come on.

01:17:48.431 --> 01:17:50.931
-All right.

01:17:50.933 --> 01:17:52.266
-So, where we gonna go?

01:17:52.268 --> 01:17:53.601
I mean, there's no car
to follow, so...

01:17:53.603 --> 01:17:55.202
-Carl usually takes people
to this factory,

01:17:55.204 --> 01:17:57.438
so I think
we should try there first.

01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:59.674
-Hey, man, you sure you want to
come with us?

01:18:02.578 --> 01:18:04.445
All right.

01:18:47.790 --> 01:18:51.158
-No, it's my dad.

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:53.661
He's giving me a bunch
of crap about my jacket.

01:19:00.169 --> 01:19:02.903
Yeah, the blue one.

01:19:02.905 --> 01:19:05.005
No, I know.
It's my favorite one.

01:19:09.712 --> 01:19:12.580
Hey, I got to go.
All right.

01:19:12.582 --> 01:19:15.249
Bye.

01:19:15.251 --> 01:19:18.018
Hey, there, sunshine.

01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:20.521
Welcome back.

01:19:20.523 --> 01:19:23.157
Why does everybody do that?
You're tied up.

01:19:23.159 --> 01:19:25.025
We're standing right in front
of you.

01:19:25.027 --> 01:19:26.460
What's all the struggling about?

01:19:26.462 --> 01:19:28.229
If you so much
as loosen anything or even try,

01:19:28.231 --> 01:19:30.731
I'm just gonna have these guys
beat the crap out of you.

01:19:33.669 --> 01:19:35.169
Whoa.

01:19:35.171 --> 01:19:37.071
What are those?

01:19:37.073 --> 01:19:38.606
Which one of those goes
into his eye?

01:19:42.211 --> 01:19:43.944
Now, see, here's the thing --

01:19:43.946 --> 01:19:46.413
your boy, Tomas,

01:19:46.415 --> 01:19:48.783
he owed my dad a pretty penny.

01:19:48.785 --> 01:19:54.155
But someone couldn't collect
before stabbing him.

01:20:01.764 --> 01:20:03.497
He's talking with the tape
on his mouth.

01:20:03.499 --> 01:20:07.067
You see what I mean?
This could be very frustrating.

01:20:07.069 --> 01:20:10.671
Take it off.

01:20:10.673 --> 01:20:14.575
-Aah!
Aah!

01:20:14.577 --> 01:20:15.609
Aah!

01:20:15.611 --> 01:20:17.178
Aah!

01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:19.246
You think that hurts?

01:20:19.248 --> 01:20:21.081
Untie me now.

01:20:21.083 --> 01:20:23.150
Fight me like real men.

01:20:23.152 --> 01:20:24.285
-Why are you trying --

01:20:24.287 --> 01:20:26.787
listen, my boys

01:20:26.789 --> 01:20:29.023
saw Tomas give you something

01:20:29.025 --> 01:20:31.025
and then you disappeared.

01:20:31.027 --> 01:20:32.426
So now, unfortunately,

01:20:32.428 --> 01:20:35.362
you're stuck
holding your friend's bill.

01:20:35.364 --> 01:20:36.730
We're gonna start the collection

01:20:36.732 --> 01:20:40.501
with whatever it is
Tomas gave you.

01:20:40.503 --> 01:20:43.337
-Tomas would have never
given out his autograph

01:20:43.339 --> 01:20:46.440
to anyone like you.

01:20:46.442 --> 01:20:48.042
-Wow.

01:20:48.044 --> 01:20:50.110
This guy's a lunatic.

01:20:50.112 --> 01:20:52.179
You know, put the tape back on.

01:20:56.652 --> 01:20:58.219
Can you put something sharp
in his face?

01:20:58.221 --> 01:21:00.187
Maybe speed this process
up a little bit?

01:21:00.189 --> 01:21:02.289
See what we have to put up with

01:21:02.291 --> 01:21:04.325
because you
can't control yourself?

01:21:04.327 --> 01:21:05.993
Now, this fools
out here all by himself,

01:21:05.995 --> 01:21:08.729
too stupid to understand that --

01:21:08.731 --> 01:21:10.865
Ken?

01:21:10.867 --> 01:21:12.266
-Come on, Sam.

01:21:12.268 --> 01:21:13.734
He had nothing
to do with Tomas's debt.

01:21:13.736 --> 01:21:15.402
He was just at the wrong place
at the wrong --

01:21:15.404 --> 01:21:18.973
-when did you start
caring so much?

01:21:18.975 --> 01:21:22.743
Ah.
Nick's substitute.

01:21:22.745 --> 01:21:24.078
You know, Kenny?

01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:25.946
You better walk away right now
and live with the fact

01:21:25.948 --> 01:21:28.616
that I'm gonna be giving you
some very negative reviews

01:21:28.618 --> 01:21:30.517
online, pal.

01:21:32.321 --> 01:21:35.723
Who the hell is this guy?

01:21:35.725 --> 01:21:38.592
-So you gonna let him go?

01:21:38.594 --> 01:21:43.597
-Private investigator turned
superhero -- Ken champaco.

01:21:43.599 --> 01:21:46.000
No, you know what?
Shoot him.

01:21:46.002 --> 01:21:47.801
All of them.

01:22:00.116 --> 01:22:01.348
Seriously?

01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:03.250
Neither of you guys
are carrying?

01:22:03.252 --> 01:22:04.818
'Cause you know I don't.

01:22:04.820 --> 01:22:08.489
This guy just brought a bucket
of tools, some plastic,

01:22:08.491 --> 01:22:09.790
had enough room for a chair,

01:22:09.792 --> 01:22:11.425
but no gun?

01:22:11.427 --> 01:22:15.362
I see now why you guys have been
doing my dad's bitch work.

01:22:15.364 --> 01:22:19.199
Now would be an excellent time
to redeem yourself.

01:22:29.745 --> 01:22:32.379
Now hurry this up.
I'll just be a minute.

01:24:54.323 --> 01:24:56.023
Not bad...

01:24:56.025 --> 01:24:58.025
For a fat guy.

01:26:10.566 --> 01:26:12.666
You're still fat.

01:29:44.380 --> 01:29:47.247
-Come on.
Hit me.

01:30:32.661 --> 01:30:34.961
-Ha!

01:31:09.264 --> 01:31:12.699
-Aah!

01:31:17.105 --> 01:31:18.705
Where's the rest of them, man?

01:31:18.707 --> 01:31:20.607
-We got them.
We got them.

01:31:20.609 --> 01:31:23.009
Can you check on him?

01:31:29.551 --> 01:31:31.985
Please?
All right.

01:31:49.838 --> 01:31:51.271
So what do we do now?

01:31:51.273 --> 01:31:53.540
Carl's obviously gonna come
after us,

01:31:53.542 --> 01:31:56.176
and then him and then David.

01:31:56.178 --> 01:31:57.744
-I think we should wait
to hear from Stan.

01:31:57.746 --> 01:32:00.113
-Yeah, where is Stan?
What is he doing?

01:32:00.115 --> 01:32:02.782
-Aargh!

01:32:04.586 --> 01:32:06.887
-All right, so,
since I know every piece of shit

01:32:06.889 --> 01:32:08.555
that you're gonna hire to go
after me and my buddies,

01:32:08.557 --> 01:32:11.491
I think it's safe to assume
that we're done here, right?

01:32:11.493 --> 01:32:13.326
-Don't you know
what kind of movie this is?

01:32:13.328 --> 01:32:16.363
First you finish him,
then we fight.

01:32:16.365 --> 01:32:17.964
-Cheap shot.
-What did you say?

01:32:17.966 --> 01:32:20.734
-I said, "cheap shot."
I wasn't ready.

01:32:20.736 --> 01:32:22.702
I was gonna kick you ass.
-Oh, would you?

01:32:22.704 --> 01:32:25.305
-Yeah.

01:32:25.307 --> 01:32:28.341
-Let's go!

01:32:28.343 --> 01:32:30.777
Argh!

01:32:32.614 --> 01:32:35.048
Argh!

01:32:38.153 --> 01:32:40.086
Argh!

01:32:42.758 --> 01:32:44.991
Argh!

01:32:48.597 --> 01:32:50.497
Aah!

01:32:52.501 --> 01:32:54.134
Argh!

01:32:57.339 --> 01:33:00.006
Argh!
