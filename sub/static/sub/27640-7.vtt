00:05.606 --> 00:08.073
- Hmm. David.
- Hmm?

00:08.209 --> 00:10.576
- Perhaps your indigestion
is caused by the speed

00:10.578 --> 00:13.412
with which you consume
your food.

00:14.315 --> 00:16.848
- We should do breakfast more
often, this is really fun.

00:16.917 --> 00:18.050
- Mhmm.

00:18.052 --> 00:20.119
- Hi, Mrs. Rose.
- Hello, Patrick.

00:20.254 --> 00:22.721
Care to ensconce yourself?
- Oh, I wish I could.

00:22.723 --> 00:24.322
Um, David?
- Hmm?

00:24.358 --> 00:26.058
- You told me you were just
running across the street

00:26.127 --> 00:28.060
for a cup of coffee.
- But then I got hungry.

00:28.129 --> 00:30.029
I hadn't eaten since last night.

00:30.164 --> 00:31.930
- It's just that I have to get
ready for my audition,

00:31.966 --> 00:33.599
and somebody has to be
at the store, so.

00:33.601 --> 00:36.334
- You're being audited?
Those bastards!

00:36.336 --> 00:37.736
- No, uh, audition.

00:37.805 --> 00:40.239
I'm actually trying out
for "Cabaret".

00:40.241 --> 00:42.174
- "Cabaret".

00:42.309 --> 00:43.608
- You're familiar with the show?

00:43.677 --> 00:45.077
- Please don't start.

00:45.079 --> 00:47.679
- The year was 1979.
- '79. Mhmm.

00:47.681 --> 00:49.447
- I was but 17.

00:49.483 --> 00:51.049
- She was not 17.
- Ah.

00:51.085 --> 00:54.820
- Hostessing at a charming
gas station deli,

00:54.889 --> 00:57.890
when the great director,
Rocky Nickels,

00:58.025 --> 00:59.491
came in for a Reuben.

00:59.527 --> 01:01.025
That's a sandwich.

01:01.062 --> 01:02.594
Little did he know,

01:02.596 --> 01:04.629
he would end up biting into
something

01:04.698 --> 01:07.199
far more suffonsifying.
- Far more suffonsifying.

01:07.334 --> 01:09.767
- A ripe young actress
who he'd soon cast

01:09.804 --> 01:11.970
in the leading role
of Sally Bowles.

01:11.972 --> 01:13.172
- Sally Bowles, yes.

01:13.307 --> 01:15.640
- In the production of...
(In Unison) "Cabaret".

01:15.676 --> 01:17.109
- Yes!

01:17.111 --> 01:19.978
Ask me how many ovations
I got on closing night.

01:20.047 --> 01:22.614
- Six.
- David, you know the answer!

01:22.650 --> 01:24.016
- That's a lot of ovations.

01:24.151 --> 01:26.785
- Mhmm, three by demand,
and three on the house.

01:26.854 --> 01:29.387
And who, may I ask,
is bold enough

01:29.423 --> 01:32.424
to scale this cultural monolith?

01:32.493 --> 01:36.061
- Jocelyn's actually directing
for the community theatre, so.

01:36.130 --> 01:37.329
- Jocelyn?

01:37.331 --> 01:39.398
- That's very ambitious
of Jocelyn.

01:39.533 --> 01:41.966
- Yeah well, I just thought
it could be a fun thing to do.

01:42.002 --> 01:44.736
- Yes, the exact sentiment
expressed by the passengers

01:44.805 --> 01:47.172
as they stepped aboard
the Titanic.

01:47.307 --> 01:49.508
- Okay, well, that's really
encouraging.

01:49.643 --> 01:52.477

a rip-roaring bash

01:52.513 --> 01:55.214
before that bloody iceberg.

02:37.258 --> 02:38.723
I changed my diet,

02:38.759 --> 02:40.792
and I started taking
Zumba classes.

a council-related symposium

it right.

for "Cabaret".

03:52.466 --> 03:53.999

03:54.001 --> 03:55.333
- Yeah, I actually wanted
to do "Cats",

03:55.369 --> 03:58.136
but everybody said that
it was too political, so.

03:58.138 --> 04:00.672
- I'm not sure you're aware
of this Jocelyn,

04:00.708 --> 04:04.142
but "Cabaret" is the very show
that launched my career.

04:05.346 --> 04:07.079
- Right!
- Mhmm.

04:07.214 --> 04:09.514

I'm simply here to wish you
the best of luck.

04:16.657 --> 04:18.623
since you have the strong

04:18.692 --> 04:20.492
personal connection
to "Cabaret",

04:20.494 --> 04:23.294
do you think that you could...
help me?

04:23.296 --> 04:25.364
- No, this is your bebe,
Jocelyn,

04:25.499 --> 04:28.300
and an artistic cradle robber,
I am not.

04:28.302 --> 04:31.103

this actual baby at home,

04:31.238 --> 04:33.905
plus a whole lot of term papers
to grade.

04:33.941 --> 04:36.841
- I wouldn't want to step
on anyone's toes.

04:36.877 --> 04:39.911
But if you would indulge me
a promenade along...

04:39.980 --> 04:41.179
memory lane,

04:41.215 --> 04:43.415
I'd love to sit in
on the auditions.

04:43.484 --> 04:46.718
- Okay, if that's as much as
you're willing to contribute.

04:46.787 --> 04:49.520
All righty.
- It's settled, then.

04:49.556 --> 04:52.557
Consider me a silent monarch
on the wall.

04:52.593 --> 04:54.592
- Will do.
- Now, Jocelyn...

04:54.628 --> 04:57.796
is this really how you want
to set up the chairs?

05:00.467 --> 05:02.767

a baby into the store.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.310
- Shhh. Yeah.

05:12.346 --> 05:14.212
And I don't know why I haven't
brought him in sooner,

05:14.248 --> 05:15.914
this place is perfect.

05:15.916 --> 05:17.349
- Thank you so much.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.484
- Yeah, they say that babies
fall asleep quickest

05:19.553 --> 05:21.620
when they're surrounded
by an eerie,

05:21.755 --> 05:24.155
almost crypt-like silence.

05:24.157 --> 05:27.359
- What can I do to shorten
your stay in my store, Roland?

05:27.494 --> 05:31.562
- Oh, uh, Joce wanted me
to pick up uh, some of this.

05:31.598 --> 05:33.898
This organic applesauce.

05:33.934 --> 05:35.767
Organic. Listen to me!

05:35.803 --> 05:37.736
Who am I? Gwyneth Paltrow?

05:37.738 --> 05:38.803
(Both laugh)

05:38.872 --> 05:40.271
- No, no, you're not.

05:40.341 --> 05:42.140
(Cell phone rings)
- Ah.

05:42.142 --> 05:43.975
(Roland Jr. cries)

05:44.111 --> 05:46.144
- Ooh sorry, I gotta take this.

05:46.279 --> 05:47.612
- What about this, though?

05:47.648 --> 05:50.682
- Uh, hello? Ronnie.
Hi, what's going on?

05:50.684 --> 05:52.918
(Gasps) No! Oh my God!

05:52.920 --> 05:54.152
- What?

05:54.287 --> 05:57.188
- Dave, please,
I'm on a private call.

05:57.224 --> 05:59.390
- Uh huh, okay,
I'll be right over.

05:59.426 --> 06:01.626
- Oh boy, sheeesh.

06:01.762 --> 06:02.894
- Everything okay?

06:02.963 --> 06:05.330
- Well, Gwen was trimming
that big oak tree

06:05.332 --> 06:07.598
behind her place, and she took
out a power line,

06:07.634 --> 06:09.601
and now there are live wires

06:09.603 --> 06:11.803
flailing every which way
but loose.

06:11.938 --> 06:13.605
(Laughs) So I guess uh,

06:13.740 --> 06:15.740
Rollie Jr. and I should
head over there.

06:15.809 --> 06:17.342
Hey, this applesauce,

06:17.344 --> 06:19.677
it's not gonna go bad
in the sun, is it?

06:19.813 --> 06:21.646
- I'd be more concerned
about the baby,

06:21.648 --> 06:23.682
but what do I know?
- You're right!

06:23.684 --> 06:25.717
You know what I'll do?
I'll leave 'em both here.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.118
- No! No, absolutely not!

06:27.187 --> 06:28.954
I have a meeting
in half an hour

06:28.956 --> 06:30.755
with a potential big money
client,

06:30.758 --> 06:33.425
and a rogue baby in my store
does not present as polished,

06:33.560 --> 06:35.893
or professional.
- He'll be fine.

06:35.929 --> 06:37.828
If he gets cranky,
give him some applesauce.

06:37.830 --> 06:39.631
- Those are $10 a jar!

06:39.700 --> 06:42.000
- Okay.
- Dammit!

06:42.069 --> 06:43.502
(Roland Jr. cries)

06:43.637 --> 06:45.770
- No, I will not accept that.

06:45.839 --> 06:47.572
- No, but I entered that
in there already.

06:47.707 --> 06:49.240
- Dad, Cheryl wants to take
a shower,

06:49.276 --> 06:50.942
and all she has is a facecloth.

06:50.978 --> 06:54.111
- Oh, okay.
Well, Stevie uh...

06:54.148 --> 06:56.915
can you run some towels down
to room four?

06:56.917 --> 06:59.784
- Why do I need to do it?
- Okay, what's the big deal?

06:59.853 --> 07:02.286
Just walk them over,
and drop them off.

07:02.322 --> 07:04.188
- Well, Alexis,
if you must know,

07:04.190 --> 07:06.791
when I was checking Cheryl
in this morning,

07:06.794 --> 07:09.060
I-I got a bit of a vibe.

07:09.196 --> 07:11.763
- Ew, what kind of vibe?

07:11.765 --> 07:14.166
- I think I might've gotten...

07:15.736 --> 07:17.402
a whisper of desire.

07:20.174 --> 07:21.873
- "Whisper of des--"
Oh my God!

07:21.909 --> 07:25.076
Please never use that phrase
like, ever again.

07:25.078 --> 07:27.078
- My face was touched.

07:27.213 --> 07:30.114
She was doing this.
She called me handsome!

07:30.184 --> 07:32.216
- Okay, Cheryl is in a happy
marriage.

07:32.252 --> 07:34.019
She just happens to be
very like,

07:34.154 --> 07:35.653
warm, and affectionate.

07:35.689 --> 07:38.089
- Her hand was warm
and affectionate.

07:39.226 --> 07:41.560
Ted! Hi!

07:41.562 --> 07:43.361
- Uh, my mom was just wondering

07:43.363 --> 07:45.263
if she could maybe get
some towels?

07:45.398 --> 07:47.199
- Towels? Yes!

07:49.970 --> 07:53.572
And perhaps you could take
these to her?

07:53.707 --> 07:55.106
- Oh yeah, sure.

07:55.108 --> 07:57.509
My mom also wants you
to join us for lunch today.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.377
She said she won't take no
for an answer.

07:59.379 --> 08:01.780
- Uh, that would leave Stevie
alone here at the counter.

08:01.782 --> 08:03.114
And I-I don't think that uh...

08:03.183 --> 08:04.916
- Oh, but I prefer it that way,
though.

08:04.918 --> 08:07.518
- Oh my God, Dad,
um yes, he can come.

08:07.520 --> 08:09.220
- Okay great,
I'll go let her know.

08:09.223 --> 08:10.922
She was just saying
how she wants to get

08:10.924 --> 08:13.091
to know you better.
- Hmm. Hmm.

08:15.228 --> 08:17.062
- Psh! Shh! Wait!
Do you hear that?

08:18.432 --> 08:20.799
- What?
- It's like a...

08:20.934 --> 08:22.901
faint whisper of desire.

08:24.637 --> 08:26.404
- That was a good one.
- Thanks!

08:26.440 --> 08:28.340
Oh boy. Don't do that.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.843
Jocelyn: Wow, Bob.

08:31.912 --> 08:34.746
Who knew you were a man
of so many talents?

08:34.815 --> 08:36.548
Well, I don't need to see
any more.

08:36.683 --> 08:37.749
Bob--
- Ahem!

08:37.884 --> 08:39.350
- Moira, is there anything
you'd like to add

08:39.386 --> 08:40.986
to Bob's audition?

08:40.988 --> 08:43.088
- I'm just marinating
in memories.

08:43.223 --> 08:44.889
- Okay well,
we start rehearsals--

08:44.958 --> 08:46.491
- But while I marinate,

08:46.560 --> 08:48.693
it might be worth observing

08:48.828 --> 08:51.829
your giving Bob a slight
redirection.

08:51.831 --> 08:54.032
- Mhmm...
- If that's all right?

08:54.167 --> 08:56.768
- Oh, I've cleared
my afternoon for this.

08:56.770 --> 08:58.970
- Okay, uh...

08:58.972 --> 09:01.039
well, try it um,

09:01.041 --> 09:02.907
angrier? You know, like, grr,

09:02.910 --> 09:04.576
put your hands on your hips.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.545
- Like this?

09:08.181 --> 09:09.447
- Oh dear.

09:09.483 --> 09:11.516
- Okay. Well, it seems to me,

09:11.518 --> 09:13.118
that it would be helpful
to both of us

09:13.253 --> 09:15.219
if you would just join us
here at the table.

09:15.255 --> 09:17.522
- Well, there's a note
I'm incapable of rebuffing.

09:17.524 --> 09:18.924
You heard the director.

09:20.193 --> 09:21.393
Thank you.

09:21.528 --> 09:23.661
- Do you want me to sing
"Ave Maria" again?

09:23.697 --> 09:27.198
- If you must, but I think what
Jocelyn is looking for here

09:27.200 --> 09:30.869
is a foreboding vibration
of pre-war Berlin,

09:32.339 --> 09:34.572
easy on the accent.

09:34.575 --> 09:36.741
- Roger that, yeah.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.081
(Laughs)

09:46.687 --> 09:49.621
- Okay, so this is what
we call mutual respect.

09:49.623 --> 09:51.956
So if you could just stay
like this for the an hour,

09:52.025 --> 09:54.192
that would be ideal. Okay.

09:55.429 --> 09:57.561
- Hi, David?
- Tina?

09:57.598 --> 09:58.963
- Mhmm.
- Oh my goodness!

09:58.999 --> 10:00.898
We are so excited
at the prospect

10:00.934 --> 10:02.534
of working with "Premium
Parties".

10:02.536 --> 10:04.769
- Oh, that's very sweet.
- Yeah, so as you know,

10:04.771 --> 10:06.371
we can source basically
anything you need

10:06.440 --> 10:07.905
when it comes
to party essentials.

10:07.975 --> 10:10.975
Gift bags, catering,
Shaman-blessed crystals,

10:11.011 --> 10:12.877
artisanal Reiki gloves.

10:12.879 --> 10:15.380
- For today, I was just hoping
to hear about the store,

10:15.382 --> 10:17.115
and make a connection with you.

10:17.184 --> 10:19.250
- Oh, okay.

10:19.252 --> 10:21.719
Yeah, no, I love making
connections.

10:21.855 --> 10:23.254
(Roland Jr. gurgles)
- Oh.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.256
- Oh no, that's not--

10:25.292 --> 10:28.126
- Oh, I didn't know that
you had a little guy!

10:28.128 --> 10:30.328
- Yeah, his dad is just out
right now,

10:30.397 --> 10:32.063
but he should be back
any time.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.798
- Oh yeah, they say that,
and next thing you know,

10:33.933 --> 10:36.034
it's been an hour, am I right?

10:36.169 --> 10:38.069
- Yes. Yeah.

10:38.138 --> 10:41.873
They say it's an emergency,
but is it really, Tina?

10:41.942 --> 10:43.941
- Yeah, so tell me the last
time that watching

10:43.977 --> 10:46.177
the new "Fast and the Furious"
was an emergency!

10:46.312 --> 10:47.679
- (Nervous chuckle)

10:47.748 --> 10:49.214
- You know, I have
a two-year-old at home.

10:49.349 --> 10:52.283
- Oh.
- How old's this little one?

10:52.285 --> 10:54.686
- He's um, three to four
months.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.154
- Oh, wow.
- Mhmm.

10:56.289 --> 10:59.090
- He's huge for four months.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.292
- Mm, big eater.
- Ah.

11:01.294 --> 11:04.929
- You know, we-we do sell these
delicious granola bars.

11:04.931 --> 11:06.531
- You're giving him granola?

11:07.768 --> 11:10.301
- No, no, I eat
the granola bars,

11:10.370 --> 11:12.103
while taking care of him.

11:12.238 --> 11:14.205
He prefers um...

11:15.375 --> 11:16.774
the organic applesauce.

11:16.843 --> 11:19.376
- It must be so helpful to have
your own little product tester

11:19.413 --> 11:20.879
here in the store with you.

11:20.881 --> 11:22.647
- You know what?

11:22.782 --> 11:24.115
Why don't you take this home
with you,

11:24.151 --> 11:26.217
try it out on your little one.

11:27.921 --> 11:30.321
- You know, I'm actually
throwing a baby shower

11:30.390 --> 11:32.123
next week, uh, but I mean,

11:32.192 --> 11:34.726
that's probably not enough
notice for you.

11:34.728 --> 11:37.261
- I threw a baby shower
for my dear friend, Jocelyn,

11:37.297 --> 11:38.796
within a day,

11:38.865 --> 11:41.332
I'm pretty sure I can get
supplies by next week.

11:42.736 --> 11:45.937
- You two might be my new
favourite vendors.

11:45.939 --> 11:47.505
(Both laugh)

11:48.675 --> 11:50.141
- Do you think that maybe
he could um,

11:50.143 --> 11:52.477
show me around?

11:52.479 --> 11:55.213
- Yeah. You want,
you wanna show her around,

11:55.215 --> 11:57.682
little tyke?
- Show me around. Hm.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.087
<i> Cheryl: And there he was,</i>

12:03.123 --> 12:06.558
naked as the day he was born,
just wailing!

12:06.693 --> 12:08.893
It had rained, and his
cotton candy was melting

12:09.028 --> 12:10.495
all down his hand!

12:11.798 --> 12:13.631
- Yeah, that was fun, but uh,

12:13.700 --> 12:15.767
maybe we can start telling
some stories

12:15.902 --> 12:18.503
about someone else
who was naked and crying?

12:18.638 --> 12:20.071
- Okay, fine, but I think
everyone here

12:20.073 --> 12:22.373
has already heard about
my Vin Diesel adventure.

12:22.375 --> 12:25.042
- Mind if I have a fry, Johnny?

12:25.078 --> 12:27.245
- No, no, go ahead,
help yourself.

12:27.314 --> 12:29.647
and if anyone else wants a fry,

12:29.683 --> 12:31.115
please feel free to take one.

12:31.184 --> 12:33.318
- Mom, I really wish I'd have
known about this trip

12:33.320 --> 12:35.119
a little bit sooner, I wouldn't
have asked Alexis

12:35.155 --> 12:36.721
to help me out at the clinic
today,

12:36.856 --> 12:38.123
and she could've kept
you company.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.924
- Mhmm, I also wish you hadn't
asked me to help out

12:40.059 --> 12:41.259
at the clinic today.
- Oh, don't worry,

12:41.394 --> 12:43.594
this was just a last
minute whim.

12:43.630 --> 12:45.329
I just don't know what
I'm gonna do with those tickets

12:45.365 --> 12:47.932
that I bought to the Elmdale
Gallery.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.335
Johnny...

12:51.371 --> 12:53.204
I don't suppose you'd be
interested in playing

12:53.206 --> 12:55.740
hooky today, huh?
- Oh, no!

12:55.875 --> 12:59.610
I haven't played hooky
since college.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.679
- Dad, I think you can spare
a couple of hours

13:01.681 --> 13:02.947
to accompany Mrs. Mullens,

13:03.082 --> 13:05.216
who otherwise would be going
by herself.

13:05.351 --> 13:07.418
- Well, when you put it
that way, Alexis,

13:07.420 --> 13:10.388
uh, I'd look like a real jerk
if I said no.

13:11.424 --> 13:13.224
- Then lunch is on me.

13:14.694 --> 13:17.028
A free room and now a hot date

13:17.163 --> 13:18.896
with the owner of the motel?

13:19.032 --> 13:20.932
(Laughs) Lucky me!

13:21.001 --> 13:21.599
- Yeah...

13:23.670 --> 13:25.770
- I can't tell you how much
this means to me, Mr. Rose.

13:25.772 --> 13:28.606
- Oh, I'm just...
being a good host.

13:28.642 --> 13:32.310
- See, my mom and my Step-Dad
separated a while ago.

13:32.445 --> 13:34.846
- What? Why have I not heard
about this before?

13:34.915 --> 13:36.513
- Well, I wanted to tell you,

13:36.550 --> 13:38.383
but she made me promise
to keep it quiet.

13:38.385 --> 13:40.585
You know, small town,
people talk.

13:40.720 --> 13:44.188
- So Ted, your mom is currently
unattached?

13:44.224 --> 13:47.025
- Yeah, yeah, but she's in
a much better place these days.

13:47.027 --> 13:49.327
She's got like,
a whole new lease on life.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.796
She told me that she's just
going after whatever she wants,

13:51.931 --> 13:53.398
no holds barred!

13:53.400 --> 13:57.435
- Oh, well hopefully,
some holds barred.

13:58.538 --> 14:00.004
- Johnny?
- Hmm?

14:00.139 --> 14:02.206
- I'm ready to go.
- Oh!

14:02.209 --> 14:05.009
- Um Dad, if you do have
too much work this afternoon...

14:05.045 --> 14:07.912
- Well, we're in it now, Alexis.

14:09.082 --> 14:12.016
- Here we go. Oh, after you.
- Oh! (Laughs)

14:12.151 --> 14:14.819
- Please, don't go.
- Are you serious?

14:14.821 --> 14:16.287
Jocelyn: Okay, I'm just
gonna stop you there.

14:16.422 --> 14:17.622
- Thank you.

14:17.757 --> 14:20.091
- Um Beth, I was wondering
if you could maybe...

14:20.226 --> 14:21.693
- Dig deeper, yeah.

14:21.828 --> 14:23.962
Let's throw away the lines,
soften the edges.

14:24.097 --> 14:27.098
- Yes, I was gonna say,
speak louder,

14:27.167 --> 14:29.433
but that also sounds important.

14:29.502 --> 14:32.770
So why don't we um...
- Yes, tap her out!

14:32.772 --> 14:36.908
You step in, and lay the
groundwork for Patrick. Yes.

14:36.910 --> 14:39.110
- You want me to tap in
and act with him?

14:39.179 --> 14:40.711
- Mea culpa, Jocelyn,

14:40.747 --> 14:43.915
I sorely underestimated
your instincts.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.283
- Okay.

14:47.320 --> 14:50.255
- Okay, the thing you must
understand about Cliff,

14:50.390 --> 14:52.390
Patrick, is that he has been
with many women,

14:52.459 --> 14:55.860
but he's never derived
true pleasure from it.

14:57.998 --> 14:59.997
- I think I can wrap
my head around that.

15:00.033 --> 15:02.233
- Okay, when you're ready.

15:05.505 --> 15:07.071
(Patrick and Jocelyn
clear their throats)

15:07.107 --> 15:08.640
- Don't go.

15:08.775 --> 15:11.475
- What?
- Please, don't go!

15:11.544 --> 15:13.544
- Ooh, less desperation.

15:13.546 --> 15:15.546
- Are you serious?

15:15.615 --> 15:18.649
- The hell with Bobby!
Maybe I like you here.

15:18.652 --> 15:20.485
- Firm, but not loud.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.689
- The truth is, Sally,
when you're out all night,

15:24.691 --> 15:26.223
I can't sleep.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.459
- Better, better.
Now seduce her.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.562
- Oh my.

15:31.564 --> 15:34.198
- Our little bed suddenly
seems so empty.

15:34.267 --> 15:37.068
I've never felt this way
about anyone.

15:39.005 --> 15:40.304
- You truly mean this?

15:40.306 --> 15:41.906
- Bring it home...

15:42.041 --> 15:44.375
- More than I've ever
meant anything.

15:44.411 --> 15:46.310
- And, scene!

15:46.313 --> 15:48.513
Oh!
- Whew!

15:48.648 --> 15:50.515
- Now that is a breakthrough.

15:50.517 --> 15:52.250
Patrick, thank you.

15:52.385 --> 15:55.586
Or should I say thank you
to our new Emcee!

15:55.588 --> 15:57.521
- Oh no, no, Patrick
was auditioning

15:57.557 --> 16:00.058
for the role of Cliff.
- Yes, he was.

16:00.060 --> 16:01.925
But we all know you put
your biggest talent

16:01.962 --> 16:03.962
front and centre.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.865
Isn't that right, Jocelyn?
- Sure.

16:07.934 --> 16:10.134
As long as I never have to act
again.

16:10.269 --> 16:12.036
- Okay, no.

16:14.374 --> 16:16.106
- Thank you! (Laughs)

16:16.142 --> 16:18.476
- We'll-we'll call your people.

16:19.846 --> 16:21.779
- I did not think I would
find a new vendor today.

16:21.914 --> 16:24.281
- Well, sometimes
it just clicks. Here.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.949
- Well, why don't I swing
back on Wednesday,

16:25.986 --> 16:27.618
and pick everything up
for the baby shower?

16:27.620 --> 16:28.753
- Perfect!

16:28.822 --> 16:31.956
- And I hope I'll see you
on Wednesday, too!

16:31.958 --> 16:33.224
- Hey!

16:34.327 --> 16:37.295
How's my big boy?
- This must be Dad.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.263
- Yes.
- Roland Schitt.

16:39.265 --> 16:41.399
- Tina Holbridge.
It is so nice to meet you.

16:41.534 --> 16:43.434
I've just been spending
the whole afternoon

16:43.569 --> 16:45.169
with your two special guys.

16:45.238 --> 16:48.705
- Oh, well, you know,
Roland Jr. and I,

16:48.742 --> 16:50.908
are gettin' there,
but uh, this guy,

16:50.944 --> 16:52.777
I've known him for a long time.

16:52.846 --> 16:55.646
You know that he uh,
took me shopping once?

16:55.648 --> 16:58.783
- Yeah, you know what?
Are you ready to take um, him?

16:58.785 --> 17:01.052
Because I'm sure you have
a busy day.

17:01.187 --> 17:03.054
- Yeah, I should probably
grab him, and go.

17:03.189 --> 17:04.856
I'm sorry, I would've been
here sooner,

17:04.991 --> 17:07.258
but I got electrocuted
three times,

17:07.327 --> 17:10.194
and the last time I didn't
bounce back quite as fast.

17:10.196 --> 17:14.932
- Oh. Well, the important part
is that you're-you're here now.

17:15.068 --> 17:17.402
- Yeah, and luckily
Gwen's fine, too.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.470
I don't know why she was
wearing that rubber dress

17:19.605 --> 17:21.939
when she cut that wire,
but it saved her life.

17:22.008 --> 17:24.475
- Hmm!
- Wow...

17:24.544 --> 17:28.346
Well, I should probably let
you guys have some family time.

17:28.481 --> 17:30.948
I am so looking forward
to working with you, David.

17:30.950 --> 17:32.250
- Likewise.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.153
(Roland sighs)

17:36.222 --> 17:39.490
- Hey, sounds like the meeting
went pretty well.

17:39.526 --> 17:41.492
- It couldn't have gone better!
Yeah.

17:41.561 --> 17:44.362
So, if ever you need me
to babysit this little one,

17:44.364 --> 17:46.330
I have some openings.

17:46.332 --> 17:48.299
- Oh, well, that's great,
because Joce and I

17:48.301 --> 17:50.101
were thinking about going to
the movies tomorrow night.

17:50.170 --> 17:53.237
- I was thinking next Wednesday
between four and five pm.

17:53.239 --> 17:55.439
- Mm, yeah, no, Thursday,

17:55.508 --> 17:57.174
that's probably gonna be
better for us.

17:57.210 --> 17:58.810
- Let's go with Wednesday.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.546
(Car rumbles)

18:01.681 --> 18:04.448
- Thank you, Johnny,
for a lovely afternoon.

18:04.517 --> 18:07.852
- Well, it's always a thrill
to experience a collection

18:07.854 --> 18:11.255
of nude photographs with a...
a new friend.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.091
- It was eye-opening.

18:14.193 --> 18:17.095
Johnny, I have something
to tell you.

18:18.131 --> 18:20.330
(Door opens)
- Uh huh?

18:20.366 --> 18:23.000
- Umm, what's going on
over here?

18:23.002 --> 18:24.535
- Hey, you crazy kids.

18:24.537 --> 18:26.303
Hope you didn't have too much
fun this afternoon.

18:26.372 --> 18:28.673
- Alexis, I was just
about to tell Johnny,

18:28.808 --> 18:31.542
so I might as well
tell you, too.

18:31.677 --> 18:34.912
Ted's Step-Dad and I
have separated.

18:35.047 --> 18:36.614
- Oh my gosh.
- Oh!

18:38.118 --> 18:39.984
- It's for the best.

18:39.986 --> 18:43.220
In fact, I think I've already
started to develop feelings

18:43.356 --> 18:45.957
for someone new.
- So soon?

18:45.959 --> 18:49.160
- You wanna know the best part?
- Not necessarily.

18:49.162 --> 18:51.562
- He's charming, and handsome.

18:51.564 --> 18:53.831
- Okay, I think we understand
where this is going.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.933
- And ten years younger!

18:56.068 --> 18:57.401
- Than?

18:58.605 --> 19:00.838
- I've fallen for
my Zumba instructor.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.239
- Bill?
- Bill.

19:02.275 --> 19:03.507
- Well, Bill's great!

19:03.510 --> 19:04.976
Does this mean that I get
his gym discount?

19:05.111 --> 19:06.710
- It does!
- Awww!

19:06.746 --> 19:08.846
(Ted and Cheryl laugh)

19:08.915 --> 19:10.847
- This is great news.

19:10.884 --> 19:12.650
Isn't this great news, Dad?

19:12.719 --> 19:15.119
- Yes, yes, I'm relieved...

19:15.121 --> 19:17.955
that you're so happy.
- Mhmm.

19:18.090 --> 19:20.924
- Thank you for providing such
a safe place for me

19:20.960 --> 19:22.793
this afternoon.

19:22.795 --> 19:25.463
You know, you remind me
of my older brother.

19:25.598 --> 19:27.064
- Hey, maybe I should
start calling you

19:27.100 --> 19:28.732
"Uncle Johnny," then, huh?

19:28.768 --> 19:31.168
- Oh, ha ha ha.
- No. Nope. Nope.

19:31.303 --> 19:32.669
- Mom, come on, tell me
all about it.

19:32.705 --> 19:34.672
- Oh!

19:36.843 --> 19:38.409
- I'm just worried about
what that young,

19:38.544 --> 19:40.277
hot young Zumba instructor
is gonna do

19:40.413 --> 19:43.347
when he finds out that Cheryl
has a huge crush on you.

19:43.349 --> 19:44.948
- Okay, Alexis.

19:44.984 --> 19:46.717
But you bought into it
for a second there.

19:51.490 --> 19:53.624
- Well that was a great day
of auditions today, Moira.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.492
- Agreed.

19:55.494 --> 19:57.895
Wow, in a desert of mediocrity,

19:58.030 --> 20:00.531
you managed to divine
a quiet revelation

20:00.533 --> 20:03.000
in Ronnie's Fraulein Schneider.

20:03.036 --> 20:05.136
- Well, I think you deserve
most of the credit.

20:05.271 --> 20:07.438
You know, watching you work
with the actors today,

20:07.507 --> 20:09.874
I think it was pretty obvious
that you should--

20:10.009 --> 20:12.142
- Reprise my role of Sally?

20:12.212 --> 20:14.311
- Uh, maybe? But...

20:14.380 --> 20:17.248
- There's the age discrepancy.
Bit of a challenge there.

20:17.383 --> 20:20.117
Although I did play
Liesl Von Trapp at 50.

20:20.119 --> 20:22.153
- Actually...

20:23.189 --> 20:25.523
working with you made me
realize that I may not

20:25.658 --> 20:27.257
have the skills to do this.

20:27.293 --> 20:30.461
But you, you were practically
directly by yourself today.

20:30.530 --> 20:33.064
- Oh, Jocelyn, thank you.

20:33.066 --> 20:35.332
And now I fear
I've overstepped.

20:35.368 --> 20:38.269
- No, no, no, please!
Step all over me.

20:38.271 --> 20:41.205
You should be the director,
it's clearly in your blood.

20:41.340 --> 20:43.541
- Well, humility forbids me
from thinking

20:43.676 --> 20:47.078
I could become a quadruple
threat that easily.

20:47.213 --> 20:50.213
- Please, Moira.
You'd be doing me a favour.

20:50.250 --> 20:52.016
I mean, it's either that,

20:52.018 --> 20:53.684
or you could call
Mr. and Mrs. Tekenos

20:53.753 --> 20:55.019
and let them know
that their daughter

20:55.088 --> 20:56.821
bit another student
at school today.

20:56.956 --> 20:59.357
- I accept.
- Thank you, Moira!

20:59.492 --> 21:01.558
I am happily stepping down.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.060
- In title only.

21:03.129 --> 21:05.696
You will be there with me
every step of the way, Jocelyn.

21:05.698 --> 21:07.398
Assistant directing.

21:10.136 --> 21:12.136
- Assistant directing?
- Mhmm,

21:12.138 --> 21:15.706
some would argue it's even more
responsibility than directing.

21:17.243 --> 21:19.510
- What have I done? No!
