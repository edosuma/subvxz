00:03.137 --> 00:05.773
* Bad boys, whatcha want...

00:05.806 --> 00:08.576
CHRIS ROCK:
Typically, in the barbershop,
I heard good news.

00:08.609 --> 00:10.344
Did you hear?

00:10.378 --> 00:12.180
They renewed The Jeffersons
for another season.

00:12.213 --> 00:14.115
I love me some Weezie,
boy-- whoo!

00:14.148 --> 00:16.084
Did you hear
the Voyager space probe

00:16.117 --> 00:17.485
had its first encounter
with Uranus?

00:17.518 --> 00:19.620
But on this day,
I got the worst news

00:19.653 --> 00:21.222
I could imagine.
Did y'all hear?

00:21.255 --> 00:23.124
Malvo is out of prison.

00:23.157 --> 00:26.127
Malvo was the career criminal
that I had helped put away.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.462
But like the Terminator,
everybody knew he'd be back,

00:28.496 --> 00:30.131
and they were ready.

00:30.164 --> 00:32.400
Shoot, I put extra locks
on my doors.

00:32.433 --> 00:34.402
I put two locks on my bike.

00:34.435 --> 00:36.270
I locked up my locks.

00:36.304 --> 00:37.738
I ain't scared of Malvo.

00:37.771 --> 00:39.573
This is called
"barbershop courage."

00:39.607 --> 00:41.075
Hey, Chris!

00:41.109 --> 00:45.446
Chris, Malvo's looking
for you-oo-ooh!

00:45.479 --> 00:47.815
Say what?!

00:47.848 --> 00:50.251
* Whatcha gonna do
when they come for you? *

00:50.284 --> 00:51.385
* Bad boys, bad boys

00:51.419 --> 00:52.620
* Whatcha gonna do?

00:52.653 --> 00:53.754
* Whatcha gonna do...

00:53.787 --> 00:56.424
Somebody help!

00:58.859 --> 01:00.528
Let me in! Please!

01:04.565 --> 01:06.200
Malvo.

01:06.234 --> 01:07.668
Where you been?

01:07.701 --> 01:10.271
Jail.
Yep, that's where you were.

01:10.304 --> 01:13.574
Yeah, well, now I'm out--
and I need you to help me.

01:13.607 --> 01:16.310
I could only imagine
what he wanted help with.

01:18.879 --> 01:20.748
Drive, boy! Drive!

01:22.483 --> 01:23.684
Help with what?

01:23.717 --> 01:25.319
Look...

01:25.353 --> 01:27.555
you the smartest
person I know.

01:27.588 --> 01:28.789
Sad but true.

01:28.822 --> 01:31.292
So I need you to help me
to get into high school.

01:31.325 --> 01:33.261
Wait, why do you want
to break into high school?

01:33.294 --> 01:34.462
There's nothing worth stealing.

01:34.495 --> 01:36.397
I know-- I made
that mistake before.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.399
He was sentenced
to stealing a book

01:38.432 --> 01:41.235
about sentences.
I don't want to break in
to high school,

01:41.269 --> 01:43.137
I want to get
into high school.

01:43.171 --> 01:45.639
That'll be the first step
to turning my life around.

01:45.673 --> 01:47.341
What do you want from me?

01:47.375 --> 01:48.876
I want you to tutor me.

01:48.909 --> 01:50.711
Why don't you
just take the GED?

01:50.744 --> 01:52.880
I don't want no GED!

01:52.913 --> 01:55.149
I want the complete experience.

01:55.183 --> 01:58.486
I want to sit at the desk,
I want to smell the textbooks

01:58.519 --> 01:59.787
and the chalk,

01:59.820 --> 02:01.689
and I want to be
with the other kids,

02:01.722 --> 02:03.324
frolicking.

02:03.357 --> 02:05.793
Sounds like
Michael Jackson's diary.

02:05.826 --> 02:08.429
I-I don't mean
to make you mad...

02:08.462 --> 02:10.331
or anything...

02:10.364 --> 02:12.333
but...

02:12.366 --> 02:15.536
hypothetically speaking,
what would happen if I said no?

02:15.569 --> 02:17.638
Nothing.

02:17.671 --> 02:19.840
I'm trying to change.

02:19.873 --> 02:22.943
It's not like I'll beat you
up or stab you or anything.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.779
That's how Ike
proposed to Tina.

02:25.813 --> 02:29.617
Oh. Well, then,
in that case...

02:29.650 --> 02:32.386
my answer would have to be...

02:32.420 --> 02:33.821
no.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.856
Run!

02:45.566 --> 02:47.468
* Aw, make it funky now.

02:47.501 --> 02:50.871

PARAMOUNT TELEVISION

03:10.691 --> 03:12.393
The men in my family
loved baseball,

03:12.426 --> 03:14.328
and even though
we lived in New York,

03:14.362 --> 03:17.298
my dad's favorite team
was the Los Angeles Dodgers.

03:17.331 --> 03:19.467
Hey, son, what
you listening to?
The Mets.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.402
They're my new
favorite baseball team.

03:21.435 --> 03:23.571
:
No...!

03:25.439 --> 03:27.308
What did you say?

03:27.341 --> 03:29.277
They're, like, the best
team in the league.

03:29.310 --> 03:30.811
They're probably gonna
win the World Series.

03:30.844 --> 03:33.013
What about the Dodgers?

03:33.046 --> 03:34.548
What about 'em?

03:34.582 --> 03:37.285
They hired Jackie Robinson.

03:37.318 --> 03:38.686
So?

03:38.719 --> 03:41.389
Don't you realize that
without the Dodgers,

03:41.422 --> 03:43.491
there'd be no black
people in baseball?

03:43.524 --> 03:45.259
The Dodgers are
from Brooklyn.

03:45.293 --> 03:47.661
The Dodgers have
famous hot dogs.

03:47.695 --> 03:49.730
The Dodgers have
better logos.

03:49.763 --> 03:52.300
The Dodgers marched
with Dr. King.

03:52.333 --> 03:55.336
I don't care.
I still like the Mets.

03:55.369 --> 03:58.539
I guess you can buy
your own food and clothing.

03:58.572 --> 03:59.707
Mature.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.609
Wait, Dad,
don't be like that.

04:01.642 --> 04:04.845
Just admit it-- the Mets are
a better team than the Dodgers.

04:04.878 --> 04:07.047
My father believed
in the Dodgers so much,

04:07.080 --> 04:08.682
he did the unthinkable.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.684
You want to put
some money on it?

04:10.718 --> 04:12.886
A bet?
Yeah.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.955
The Dodgers are in
town this weekend

04:14.988 --> 04:16.890
against the Mets,
for three games.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.726
We'll see who's
the better team.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.361
How much?

04:20.394 --> 04:21.962
A dollar.

04:21.995 --> 04:24.031
Okay, you're on.

04:26.334 --> 04:27.601
Take this in the house.

04:32.673 --> 04:34.074
Back at the barbershop,

04:34.107 --> 04:36.544
everybody wanted to know
how I was still alive.

04:36.577 --> 04:37.778
And you said no?

04:37.811 --> 04:38.912
Yeah. Ain't nobody
scared of Malvo.

04:38.946 --> 04:39.980
Except you.

04:40.013 --> 04:42.583
Uh! I would have never said no.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.385
:
Mm.
Mm, what?

04:44.418 --> 04:45.586
What do you mean?

04:45.619 --> 04:46.787
The man was asking
for your help,

04:46.820 --> 04:48.956
and you turned him down--
sometimes people need a hand.

04:48.989 --> 04:51.058
Now, back when I
hadtroubles,

04:51.091 --> 04:53.694
if it wasn't for
Supercuts Johnson, I don't
know where I'd be today.

04:53.727 --> 04:55.963
Supercut Johnson?
Who's that?

04:55.996 --> 04:57.030
Anywhere relation
to Jehri Curl Johnson?

04:57.064 --> 04:59.467
He was a barber when I
was doing time in prison.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.068
He used to cut hair
on death row.

05:01.101 --> 05:02.570
Why would you want
to get your hair cut

05:02.603 --> 05:03.704
when you're on death row?

05:03.737 --> 05:05.873
You was in the joint?
Oh, yeah.

05:05.906 --> 05:06.940
Man, what'd you do?

05:06.974 --> 05:08.476
You know that tag
on the mattress

05:08.509 --> 05:10.578
that says "Do not pull off"?
I pulled that thing off.

05:10.611 --> 05:12.346
Do not pull that
tag off, man.

05:12.380 --> 05:13.647
They are not
playing with y'all.

05:13.681 --> 05:15.683
So Supercuts Johnson
taught you how to cut hair?

05:15.716 --> 05:16.784
Not only that,

05:16.817 --> 05:18.352
he told me that
everybody deserves

05:18.386 --> 05:19.587
a second chance.

05:19.620 --> 05:20.721
CHRIS:
Well, where
is he now?

05:20.754 --> 05:22.122
Oh, he's dead.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.056
He got the chair.

05:23.090 --> 05:24.658
But he looked good.

05:24.692 --> 05:26.527
So, do you think Malvo deserves
a second chance?

05:26.560 --> 05:28.128
Look, your life is
on the line, man.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.130
Do you think he needs
a second chance?

05:30.163 --> 05:32.533
Think about it.

05:32.566 --> 05:36.604
Latrinda, those are
some nice earrings.

05:36.637 --> 05:38.772
My mom would never
let me wear those.

05:38.806 --> 05:40.608
My mama don't know--
these are hers.

05:40.641 --> 05:42.476
I wear her stuff all the time.

05:42.510 --> 05:43.611
Can I try 'em on?

05:43.644 --> 05:45.946
Yeah.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.652
Hey, ladies.

05:51.685 --> 05:54.054
What are y'all up to?
Nothing.

05:54.087 --> 05:56.457
Thank you so much
for letting me come over

05:56.490 --> 05:58.526
and play with Tonya.
On, no problem, Latrinda.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.828
I'm happy she finally has
somebody nice to play with.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.095
You guys come on
downstairs.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.064
I'm making some snacks.
Okay.

06:06.834 --> 06:08.436
If I helped Malvo,

06:08.469 --> 06:10.137
maybe someday
he would help someone else--

06:10.170 --> 06:12.005
or at least kill
one less person.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.074
Can't you see I'm trying
to better myself?

06:14.107 --> 06:16.109
Malvo.
What?!

06:16.143 --> 06:17.845
I decided to help you.

06:17.878 --> 06:20.481
Looks like I ain't
gonna be needing you

06:20.514 --> 06:21.749
after all, Four Eyes!

06:21.782 --> 06:23.551
Get out of here!

06:23.584 --> 06:26.086
I thought you said you
weren't gonna beat anybody up.

06:26.119 --> 06:28.989
I wasn't beating him up,
I was threatening him!

06:29.022 --> 06:30.958
He'd gone from a felony
to a misdemeanor.

06:30.991 --> 06:32.159
That was progress.

06:32.192 --> 06:33.861
All right.
Well, let's get started.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.996
Okay.

06:36.029 --> 06:38.699
When I told my parents
about Malvo,

06:38.732 --> 06:40.901
they insisted
on talking to him,

06:40.934 --> 06:42.570
but they were prepared
for anything.

06:43.771 --> 06:45.939
I made you all
a bean pie.

06:45.973 --> 06:48.609
Oh! Thank you!
MALVO:
No. Thank you.

06:48.642 --> 06:50.778
Thank y'all for having me over.

06:50.811 --> 06:53.781
No problem.
It was our pleasure.

06:53.814 --> 06:55.783
So, I understand
you want our son

06:55.816 --> 06:57.885
to help you get
into high school.
Yes, sir.

06:57.918 --> 07:01.154
Well, you do realize
it's not a school to get high?

07:01.188 --> 07:02.790
MALVO:
Yes, ma'am.
I figure if I'm

07:02.823 --> 07:05.759
gonna turn my life around,
it starts with education.

07:05.793 --> 07:08.061
That's nice;
education is good.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.598
So what do you plan on
doing with this education?

07:10.631 --> 07:13.200
Well, short-term,
I was thinking

07:13.233 --> 07:15.135
about becoming a male nurse.

07:15.168 --> 07:17.104
Male nurse--
that's good!

07:17.137 --> 07:18.138
You know, not many of those.

07:19.740 --> 07:21.008
That way, he can care for you

07:21.041 --> 07:22.710
after he beats the hell
out of you.

07:22.743 --> 07:25.212
Long-term, I was thinking
about becoming an astronaut.

07:25.245 --> 07:26.880
:
Whoo, that's way up there.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.749
Sky's the limit.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.752
He wanted to be the first man
to steal things in space.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.721
You know, Malvo,
we-we really appreciate

07:33.754 --> 07:36.089
what you're trying
to do.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.725
JULIUS:
Yeah, but, um,

07:37.758 --> 07:41.194
we kind of don't like the
idea of our son hanging out

07:41.228 --> 07:43.597
with a... ex-con.

07:43.631 --> 07:44.732
Ex-con, yeah.

07:44.765 --> 07:48.569
I understand, sir, but all
I want is a second chance.

07:48.602 --> 07:50.771
I mean,
if I can turn my life around

07:50.804 --> 07:52.540
and become a guy like you,

07:52.573 --> 07:54.174
the world will see me
differently.

07:55.208 --> 07:57.210
No, they won't.

08:00.648 --> 08:02.616
Congratulations.

08:02.650 --> 08:05.285
(Julius and Rochelle
laughing nervously)
Good luck.

08:05.318 --> 08:08.922
Good luck. Good luck.

08:08.956 --> 08:13.293
CHRIS:
So, uh, Malvo, do you have
all your records?

08:13.326 --> 08:16.063
Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
those were lost in a...

08:16.096 --> 08:18.298
school "fire."
I don't know
why he's doing quotes.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.300
He actually
set the school on fire.

08:20.333 --> 08:23.671
Well, you know, I-I work for
the Department of Records.

08:23.704 --> 08:25.706
Maybe I could
help you find,

08:25.739 --> 08:27.207
you know, some
copies of yours.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.142
That'd be great;
I'd be most gracious.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.778
"Most gracious."

08:30.811 --> 08:32.279
Good word.

08:39.987 --> 08:42.055
Come on, man.

08:42.089 --> 08:44.925
Malvo was trying to do right,

08:44.958 --> 08:47.294
but wrong was knocking
at our door.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.902
Can I help you?

08:54.935 --> 08:56.303
Yeah, you Tonya's mother?

08:56.336 --> 08:59.039
Yes, I am. Who are you?

08:59.072 --> 09:00.941
I'm Alyson; I'm
Latrinda's mother.

09:00.974 --> 09:03.010
I'm here to talk to you
about what your daughter did.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.145
Well, what did my daughter do?

09:05.178 --> 09:06.714
Well, she talked
my little Latrinda

09:06.747 --> 09:08.081
into going to see
an R-rated movie

09:08.115 --> 09:09.349
and I don't appreciate it.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.251
I don't appreciate that outfit.

09:11.284 --> 09:14.788
Well, that does not sound
like my Tonya,

09:14.822 --> 09:17.758
but I promise you I'll get
down to the bottom of it.

09:17.791 --> 09:19.660
Yeah, you do that.

09:19.693 --> 09:22.195
I miss Salt-N-Pepa.

09:24.965 --> 09:27.801
What happened
at the movies?

09:27.835 --> 09:29.269
What do you mean?

09:29.302 --> 09:30.871
Latrinda's mother
just came here and told me

09:30.904 --> 09:32.806
you dragged her
to an R-rated movie.

09:32.840 --> 09:34.274
No, that's not what happened.

09:34.307 --> 09:36.076
Latrinda's mother was
supposed to come with us

09:36.109 --> 09:39.146
to see Police Academy 3,
but she just dropped us off,

09:39.179 --> 09:40.748
so Latrinda
wanted to sneak in

09:40.781 --> 09:42.349
to some movie called
Kiss of the Spider Woman,

09:42.382 --> 09:44.618
and they had all nasty
killing and stuff in there

09:44.652 --> 09:46.053
and I didn't want to
see it, so I left.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.921
Mm...

09:50.724 --> 09:52.259
I was used to seeing
Malvo getting booked,

09:52.292 --> 09:53.627
not reading one.

09:53.661 --> 09:54.795
Hey, Chris.

09:54.828 --> 09:56.229
Hey, Malvo.
Where you going?

09:56.263 --> 09:59.700
Down to Greenwich Village to
play Scrabble in the park.

09:59.733 --> 10:01.635
What have you got
there, an abacus?

10:01.669 --> 10:02.870
No.

10:02.903 --> 10:05.072
Well, it's obviously
not an abalone.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.306
What are you talking about?

10:06.339 --> 10:08.375
I'm just practicing
my new words.

10:08.408 --> 10:10.844
Oh, well... listen, man,

10:10.878 --> 10:12.145
my mom pulled up your records.

10:12.179 --> 10:14.181
There's no way you can
get into high school.

10:14.214 --> 10:15.683
Why not?

10:15.716 --> 10:18.151
You never graduated
junior high school.

10:19.186 --> 10:21.722
Now I feel abysmal.

10:21.755 --> 10:24.958
Nothing sadder
than a depressed gangster.

10:28.729 --> 10:31.231
Since I didn't know how to get
Malvo past the eighth grade,

10:31.264 --> 10:33.433
I decided to ask
a professional.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.703
Chris, this is wonderful.

10:35.736 --> 10:38.071
You're like
a one-man Operation PUSH.

10:38.105 --> 10:40.073
Thank you.
And Malvo,

10:40.107 --> 10:44.344
with the proper education,
you can do so many things.

10:44.377 --> 10:46.714
You could be a
garbage collector,

10:46.747 --> 10:50.818
garbage truck driver,
garbage truck dispatcher.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.452
The list is endless.

10:52.485 --> 10:55.122
So what do you think
we should do next?

10:55.155 --> 10:57.124
I've got an idea.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.059
Why don't you sit in--

10:59.092 --> 11:01.228
which your people have
historically been good at--

11:01.261 --> 11:04.064
and audit my class?

11:04.097 --> 11:07.200
"Audit" means to attend classes
or lectures as an auditor.

11:07.234 --> 11:08.902
Auditor means "hearer"
or "listener."

11:08.936 --> 11:10.838
Yes.

11:10.871 --> 11:12.239
So, how would that help him?

11:12.272 --> 11:14.942
Well, if he's preparing
for an equivalency test,

11:14.975 --> 11:17.177
he needs classroom
experience.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.847
It'll help him get acclimated.
Acclimated:

11:19.880 --> 11:22.816
"to accustom or to become
accustomed to a new climate

11:22.850 --> 11:23.917
or an environment."

11:25.118 --> 11:27.254
Thank you, Miss Morello.

11:27.287 --> 11:30.991
Yes, thank you.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.326
Chris, I think this
is a great way for you

11:33.360 --> 11:35.228
to get your father
off the streets.

11:35.262 --> 11:37.430
And in her bed.

11:37.464 --> 11:40.968
Back home, my father was
realizing that these weren't

11:41.001 --> 11:42.169
Jackie Robinson's Dodgers.

11:42.202 --> 11:45.038
Yes! Ha!
The Mets win again.

11:45.072 --> 11:47.040
Looks like you
owe me a dollar.

11:47.074 --> 11:49.309
My father was a strong man,
but right then,

11:49.342 --> 11:50.944
that dollar weighed a ton.

11:50.978 --> 11:53.246
Double or nothing?

11:53.280 --> 11:55.382
You want to let it ride?

11:58.952 --> 12:00.487
Let it ride.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.194
Malvo was a big hit in school.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.796
Now, when you're
on the yard,

12:08.829 --> 12:09.963
it's all about attitude.

12:09.997 --> 12:11.231
If you don't think
you're tough,

12:11.264 --> 12:12.532
somebody might
shank you,

12:12.565 --> 12:13.767
so you think
you're tough, right?

12:13.801 --> 12:15.903
Yeah, yeah,
I think I'm tough.

12:15.936 --> 12:17.905
And I'm ready for recess.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.072
Yeah, bring it on!

12:20.540 --> 12:22.309
Nice brag, Bobby Joe.

12:22.342 --> 12:24.377
At least he didn't shank you.

12:29.516 --> 12:30.517
That was sweet.

12:32.019 --> 12:33.320
You gonna do it like that?

12:33.353 --> 12:34.354
Huh?

12:34.387 --> 12:36.023
I'll kill...!

12:36.056 --> 12:39.292
Who can name the
five characteristics
of an ecosystem?

12:39.326 --> 12:42.329
I see one hand.

12:42.362 --> 12:44.197
Class...?

12:44.231 --> 12:45.999
Anybody else?

12:46.033 --> 12:48.335
Your mama's so fat
she left a ring
around the lake.

12:48.368 --> 12:50.570
And your mama's teeth
so yellow,

12:50.603 --> 12:52.005
when she smile,
cars slow down.

12:52.039 --> 12:53.941
And your mama's so black

12:53.974 --> 12:57.110
that she uses Armor All
instead of lotion.

12:57.144 --> 12:58.178
You talking
about my mama?

12:58.211 --> 12:59.346
No.

12:59.379 --> 13:02.482
Nah, that's a good joke.

13:02.515 --> 13:04.051
Chris, Malvo,

13:04.084 --> 13:06.186
I'm afraid
I've got some bad news.

13:06.219 --> 13:07.054
What is it?

13:07.087 --> 13:08.155
Malvo, there was

13:08.188 --> 13:09.857
a background check done on you

13:09.890 --> 13:11.324
and it was discovered

13:11.358 --> 13:13.927
you were just released
from prison.

13:13.961 --> 13:16.063
And although

13:16.096 --> 13:18.498
I find this dance with danger

13:18.531 --> 13:21.034
exciting and
titillating,

13:21.068 --> 13:24.204
other people are scared
out of their minds

13:24.237 --> 13:25.839
and they want you out.

13:25.873 --> 13:27.074
What other people?

13:27.107 --> 13:30.043
Let's just say
the higher authorities.

13:30.077 --> 13:31.945
Let's just say
the white people.

13:31.979 --> 13:34.081
Now how am I supposed
to get into high school?

13:34.114 --> 13:37.317
This is like if BET made
an after-school special.

13:43.023 --> 13:44.424
Now I was on my own trying

13:44.457 --> 13:45.926
to get Malvo through
this process,

13:45.959 --> 13:47.394
but Malvo was making progress.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.096
What year was
the Magna Carta signed?

13:49.129 --> 13:50.898
1215.

13:50.931 --> 13:51.932
You got another one right.

13:51.965 --> 13:52.966
Yeah!

13:53.000 --> 13:54.301
Hey! I was just wondering

13:54.334 --> 13:56.303
how studying was coming along.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.404
Good.

13:57.437 --> 13:59.106
Yeah, Malvo's doing great.

13:59.139 --> 14:01.241
Okay, just
checking on you.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.176
Go back to studying.

14:03.210 --> 14:06.413
Okay, um,
the Battle of Hastings?

14:06.446 --> 14:07.647
1066.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.017
You, sir, are smarter
than a ninth-grader.

14:10.050 --> 14:12.552
And you're only 32.

14:12.585 --> 14:15.422
And now another installment
of Parenting for Dummies...

14:15.455 --> 14:16.924
Where's my daughter?

14:16.957 --> 14:19.126
...at R. Kelly's house.

14:19.159 --> 14:21.228
How would I know?

14:21.261 --> 14:23.897
Well, I called
Latrinda from work.

14:23.931 --> 14:25.198
She says Tonya's coming over.

14:25.232 --> 14:27.100
I get to the house,
nobody's there,

14:27.134 --> 14:28.635
so, obviously,
Tonya dragged her off

14:28.668 --> 14:30.370
to God knows where.

14:30.403 --> 14:32.205
So you're telling me that
Latrinda's gone off someplace

14:32.239 --> 14:34.207
and you think Tonya has
something to do with it?

14:34.241 --> 14:36.043
Uh, yeah.

14:36.076 --> 14:37.677
Tonya?

14:37.710 --> 14:40.113
Yes, Mama?

14:40.147 --> 14:45.152
Do you have any idea
where Latrinda is?

14:45.185 --> 14:46.486
No.

14:46.519 --> 14:47.988
Don't lie to me.

14:48.021 --> 14:50.924
She's at Black Paul's house.

14:50.958 --> 14:51.925
Black Paul?!

14:51.959 --> 14:52.960
Black Paul?

14:52.993 --> 14:54.594
Oh, Lordy, not Black Paul!

14:54.627 --> 14:57.364
She asked me to go with her
and I said I couldn't come.

14:57.397 --> 15:01.969
Does this answer
your question?

15:02.002 --> 15:05.172
Yeah, thank you.

15:05.205 --> 15:07.174
Oh, um, excuse me.

15:07.207 --> 15:09.242
Does, um...
does Tonya know

15:09.276 --> 15:11.378
where, exactly,
Black Paul lives?

15:11.411 --> 15:13.480
Next door
to Brown Willy's house.

15:16.316 --> 15:20.988
You and I need
to talk... yeah.

15:21.021 --> 15:22.255
I'll be back.

15:22.289 --> 15:24.057
ANNOUNCER:
And here's the pitch...

15:24.091 --> 15:25.658
Strike three called!

15:25.692 --> 15:27.660
And that's the ball game
as the Mets win again

15:27.694 --> 15:29.362
against the Dodgers!
Yes! I win again!

15:29.396 --> 15:32.032
And that's two in a row...
Double or nothing.

15:32.065 --> 15:33.600
Double or nothing?

15:33.633 --> 15:35.068
On two dollars?

15:35.102 --> 15:38.071
That's right.
Double or nothing.

15:38.105 --> 15:40.140
Got yourself a bet.

15:42.375 --> 15:44.444
Ow! Ow!

15:44.477 --> 15:46.679
You know, she knows
I don't like her

15:46.713 --> 15:48.215
hanging out with Paul.

15:48.248 --> 15:50.083
I mean, that girl
act like she can do

15:50.117 --> 15:51.418
whatever she want to do.

15:51.451 --> 15:54.087
Well, maybe
she's not acting.
What?

15:54.121 --> 15:57.991
You know, I think you're
setting a bad example for her.

15:58.025 --> 16:01.194
Maybe you need to grow up.

16:01.228 --> 16:02.529
What are you
talking about?

16:02.562 --> 16:04.231
I mean, look
at yourself, Allison.

16:04.264 --> 16:06.333
You running around here
looking like Salt-N-Pepa.

16:06.366 --> 16:08.201
while your daughter's running
the streets

16:08.235 --> 16:09.669
and we out looking
for Mr. Goodbar.

16:09.702 --> 16:11.404
Look, you don't know me, okay?

16:11.438 --> 16:13.506
You don't know nothing
about me.

16:13.540 --> 16:15.575
You know what?
You right.

16:15.608 --> 16:18.511
Maybe I'm the one
who's crazy.

16:18.545 --> 16:22.082
I need to be more like you,
you know?

16:22.115 --> 16:24.117
Gritty!

16:24.151 --> 16:25.785
Living on the edge!

16:25.818 --> 16:27.254
You know?

16:27.287 --> 16:29.156
Crazy, sexy, cool!

16:29.189 --> 16:31.158
Funky, fresh!

16:31.191 --> 16:32.392
You know what?

16:32.425 --> 16:34.094
To hell with these
nappy-headed kids, girl.

16:34.127 --> 16:37.264
Let's go out
and spray paint a wall.

16:37.297 --> 16:39.199
Let's buy a knife
and trade it for a gun.

16:39.232 --> 16:40.567
Matter of fact, let's
sell some blood, girl.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.269
What you, A

16:42.302 --> 16:44.571
You know what? Maybe we should
get pregnant again.

16:44.604 --> 16:46.173
Let's have another...
Or maybe

16:46.206 --> 16:48.007
you should just mind
your own business.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.613
It was do-or-die for Malvo.

16:53.646 --> 16:55.582
Either he was gonna
pass his test

16:55.615 --> 16:57.550
or the world would have
one less astronaut.

16:57.584 --> 17:00.320
TEACHER:
The answers are all
multiple choice.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.589
So make sure you fill in
all circles completely.

17:02.622 --> 17:04.791
Keep your eyes
on your own paper.

17:04.824 --> 17:08.328
If you cheat, you leave.

17:16.669 --> 17:18.371
Well?

17:18.405 --> 17:20.273
I scored
in the 70 percentile.

17:20.307 --> 17:21.508
I passed!

17:21.541 --> 17:22.642
Congratulations.

17:22.675 --> 17:23.743
Thanks, Chris, man,

17:23.776 --> 17:25.278
I couldn't did it without you.

17:25.312 --> 17:27.314
When nobody else
believed in me, you did.

17:27.347 --> 17:30.183
You the wind beneath
beneath my wings.

17:30.217 --> 17:32.785
And he was the convict
beneath my nightmares.

17:32.819 --> 17:34.387
Despite the awkwardness
of this moment,

17:34.421 --> 17:38.491
I was really happy
I helped Malvo.

17:38.525 --> 17:41.861
Things were looking good for
Malvo, but bad for my father.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.363
ANNOUNCER:
The Mets win again,

17:43.396 --> 17:46.199
completing the three-game sweep
of the Dodgers.

17:46.233 --> 17:47.367
And the Dodger fans...

17:47.400 --> 17:48.835
It's a sad day,
isn't it?

17:48.868 --> 17:51.138
I mean, it's got to be
hard when you realize

17:51.171 --> 17:52.305
that your team
is second-best.

17:52.339 --> 17:55.242
The team you loved
your whole life

17:55.275 --> 17:56.409
since you were
a little boy.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.514
Here's you four dollars.

18:01.548 --> 18:03.383
Don't talk to me.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.485
Ow.

18:12.359 --> 18:13.560
Hey.

18:13.593 --> 18:16.596
Um, I just came by
to apologize.

18:16.629 --> 18:18.598
Really?

18:18.631 --> 18:19.866
Yeah, Latrinda

18:19.899 --> 18:21.434
went and got herself
in more trouble.

18:21.468 --> 18:23.836
She said if it was okay
for me to act this way,

18:23.870 --> 18:25.405
then why wasn't it okay for her?

18:25.438 --> 18:27.407
That's a good question.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.608
What did you tell her?

18:28.641 --> 18:30.143
I just told her,
I said,

18:30.177 --> 18:31.211
"Look, I'm your mother

18:31.244 --> 18:32.479
"and if you don't straighten up,

18:32.512 --> 18:33.380
"then I'm gonna knock
the medulla

18:33.413 --> 18:34.647
out of your oblongata."

18:34.681 --> 18:37.450
That's what I'm talking about!

18:37.484 --> 18:39.186
Good for you, girl.

18:39.219 --> 18:42.355
So, um, anyway,
I just wanted to say thank you

18:42.389 --> 18:44.424
for talking to me
the way that you did.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.159
It really helped.

18:46.193 --> 18:47.327
Any time.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.429
And you know, who knows?

18:49.462 --> 18:51.631
Maybe sometimes,
Latrinda can come over again...

18:51.664 --> 18:52.832
Take care, girl.

18:58.838 --> 19:00.473
So, you enjoying
my four dollars?

19:00.507 --> 19:01.941
That's long gone.

19:01.974 --> 19:05.278
Boy, what can you blow
four dollars on that fast?

19:05.312 --> 19:09.849
Actually, it was five, but
I figured you were worth it.

19:09.882 --> 19:11.818
For the number-one fan

19:11.851 --> 19:13.453
of thenumber-two team
in baseball.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.188
Thanks.

19:15.222 --> 19:16.889
This tender moment should
not be diminished,

19:16.923 --> 19:19.426
but later that day
my father returned that hat,

19:19.459 --> 19:20.927
got his five dollars back

19:20.960 --> 19:23.263
and ended up a dollar up
on the deal.

19:25.365 --> 19:27.434
Hey, Malvo,
how's it going?

19:27.467 --> 19:29.202
Pretty good, pretty good.

19:29.236 --> 19:31.804
I made a decision and I wanted
to tell you about it first.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.406
About high school?

19:33.440 --> 19:35.642
Yeah. I'm not going.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.910
What?!
What are you talking about?

19:37.944 --> 19:39.846
Getting into
high school is harder

19:39.879 --> 19:41.548
that getting into jail.

19:41.581 --> 19:44.217
You got to obey all these rules,
you got to fill out forms,

19:44.251 --> 19:46.353
you got to stand in line
to get licenses for things.

19:46.386 --> 19:48.221
What was all this about then?

19:48.255 --> 19:49.622
Why'd you put me
through all this?

19:49.656 --> 19:51.924
Well, I thought
my life would be better

19:51.958 --> 19:54.894
if I wasn't in trouble,
and it is better...

19:54.927 --> 19:56.263
but I'm bored, Chris.

19:56.296 --> 19:57.764
I mean, when we
were studying

19:57.797 --> 19:59.599
and working on
stuff together,

19:59.632 --> 20:01.734
it was exciting.

20:01.768 --> 20:03.370
But to tell you
the truth, Chris,

20:03.403 --> 20:04.537
I'm okay at being right,

20:04.571 --> 20:07.340
but I'm an expert
at being wrong.

20:07.374 --> 20:09.876
Malvo, you can't do this
to me, man.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.578
I mean, what about
all my hard work?

20:11.611 --> 20:13.012
Yeah, I appreciate that.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.547
That's why I'm not
robbing you anymore.

20:14.581 --> 20:15.782
Thanks.

20:15.815 --> 20:17.450
I'm robbing the store.

20:17.484 --> 20:18.718
Now give me all the money.

20:18.751 --> 20:23.456
* Everybody hates Chris.

20:23.490 --> 20:23.556
