01:04.388 --> 01:05.827
Oh, morning, Steph.

01:05.828 --> 01:08.547
I just need a signature on this one.

01:08.548 --> 01:13.083
- Oh.
- It looks quite official.

01:13.188 --> 01:14.188
Hm.

01:31.748 --> 01:33.385
These are for you.

01:35.108 --> 01:37.347
This one looks important.

01:37.348 --> 01:38.787
I just had to sign for it,

01:38.788 --> 01:46.050
open it first, it could be
Doctor Hedden's recommendation.

01:50.148 --> 01:53.347
- Yes, it is.
- Well?

01:53.348 --> 01:55.587
- Oh, for...
- What?

01:55.588 --> 01:57.507
They want me
to do three refresher courses,

01:57.508 --> 02:00.067
Starting with phlebotomy,
it's ridiculous.

02:00.068 --> 02:03.107
Oh, well, I suppose that's good,
to brush up on your skills.

02:03.108 --> 02:08.067
I don't need to brush up
my skills, thank you.

02:08.068 --> 02:09.987
Have you set a date yet?

02:09.988 --> 02:12.867
I need to let the family know,
you must have some idea.

02:12.868 --> 02:14.467
Are you going to help me or what?

02:14.468 --> 02:17.667
I am helping you, weddings take
a lot of planning, boy.

02:17.668 --> 02:21.187
Can't we just change the subject,
please, Dad?

02:21.188 --> 02:23.267
Ah, good to see you two
working so hard.

02:23.268 --> 02:26.947
- Miles, what are you doing here?
- I'm back, obviously.

02:26.948 --> 02:29.187
So what happened to Spain?

02:29.188 --> 02:31.907
Ah, you know,
it's time for a fresh start.

02:31.908 --> 02:33.507
I would have let you know,

02:33.508 --> 02:35.907
but it's all been
a bit of whirlwind.

02:35.908 --> 02:38.787
- There is a woman involved then.
- Very sharp, Al.

02:38.788 --> 02:40.971
Shirley, met her online.

02:41.028 --> 02:43.427
She's got a farm
on the way to Truro.

02:43.428 --> 02:45.347
I think she could be the one.

02:45.348 --> 02:47.427
So what is it you're after then?

02:47.428 --> 02:49.987
Oh, come on, now,
can't your favourite cousin

02:49.988 --> 02:54.307
- stop by and say hello?
- Miles.

02:54.308 --> 02:58.308
We've been making goats ice cream.

02:58.788 --> 03:02.467
And I'm offering you
an exclusive deal.

03:02.468 --> 03:04.742
Sorry, did you say goats?

03:04.868 --> 03:06.787
Shirley's got
a bunch of goats on her farm

03:06.788 --> 03:09.027
and I've been making
ice cream from their milk.

03:09.028 --> 03:11.267
It's all the rage in London.

03:11.268 --> 03:13.987
So... How many boxes
can I do you for?

03:13.988 --> 03:14.988
I'll pass.

03:15.588 --> 03:17.771
Bert, this could be big.

03:18.308 --> 03:21.027
And if anyone can sell it, it's you.

03:21.028 --> 03:26.787
You know, I've always
admired your... genius...

03:26.788 --> 03:28.227
That was a bit too much, wasn't it?

03:28.228 --> 03:30.947
Way too much,
what's this about then?

03:30.948 --> 03:33.507
Well, sales could
always do with a boost

03:33.508 --> 03:36.067
and seeing as your family and...

03:36.068 --> 03:39.427
Well, I'd appreciate it.

03:39.428 --> 03:44.547
Right, 50% discount, trial run
of 20 tubs, sale or return.

03:44.548 --> 03:46.787
Oh, you're killing me,
but all right.

03:46.788 --> 03:47.788
Miles!

03:48.068 --> 03:51.907
Oh, Shirley, this is my cousin,
Bert, and his son, Al,

03:51.908 --> 03:54.627
and they've agreed to sell our
ice cream in their pub.

03:54.628 --> 03:57.027
Oh, Des, brilliant. Well done.

03:57.028 --> 03:58.947
It was nothing, really.

03:58.948 --> 04:02.307
It's another sale,
you stop being so modest.

04:02.308 --> 04:05.347
Oh, yes,
I've always admired his genius.

04:05.348 --> 04:07.747
Yeah, shouldn't
we be getting to your appointment?

04:07.748 --> 04:10.147
Oh! Oh, lovely to meet you.

04:10.148 --> 04:13.507
Well, I suppose
we ought to try this.

04:13.508 --> 04:14.947
Yeah, I suppose so.

04:14.948 --> 04:17.403
Oh, you first.

04:22.308 --> 04:23.399
Hello there.

04:24.228 --> 04:26.147
That you don't miss this.

04:26.148 --> 04:28.228
Oh, I miss some of it.

04:28.388 --> 04:30.787
- Oi!
- Not that.

04:30.788 --> 04:33.987
- How's it going with the new head?
- Morna? She's here somewhere.

04:33.988 --> 04:34.988
Over there.

04:35.908 --> 04:38.947
She's from Delabole,
she's interesting,

04:38.948 --> 04:41.347
got a lot of plans,
fresh broom and all that.

04:41.348 --> 04:44.387
Of course, if I'd been head,
I'd have kept things as they were,

04:44.388 --> 04:46.627
but what we want and what we get

04:46.628 --> 04:49.187
aren't the same things now,
are they?

04:49.188 --> 04:51.427
- Luke!
- Morning.

04:51.428 --> 04:52.428
Morning.

04:53.188 --> 04:54.188
High five.

04:54.788 --> 04:57.187
Go on in, then.

04:57.188 --> 05:01.987
- Go on, in you come.
- Bye, James.

05:01.988 --> 05:05.347
Mel, I was thinking it might be
nice to arrange a play date,

05:05.348 --> 05:08.227
for James and some of his friends.

05:08.228 --> 05:09.667
His friends, right, yes.

05:09.668 --> 05:12.867
So, is there anyone who
gets along with in particular or...?

05:12.868 --> 05:15.427
- No, not really.
- So is it more of a group of friends?

05:15.428 --> 05:18.787
More that he doesn't
get along with anyone.

05:18.788 --> 05:22.307
He's probably going
through a socially-awkward phase.

05:22.308 --> 05:25.581
I'm sure it's nothing
to worry about.

05:25.828 --> 05:27.101
Come on, then.

05:30.948 --> 05:34.787
Mind. Morwenna, we'll need to close
the surgery on Thursday afternoon.

05:34.788 --> 05:37.507
- How come?
- I have to attend a course.

05:37.508 --> 05:39.747
Oh, snap, I went to one last night.

05:39.748 --> 05:42.467
My first first-aid
responder session.

05:42.468 --> 05:45.667
I actually had a few questions
about CPR and when you started.

05:45.668 --> 05:49.027
CPR is instigated when a victim
of collapse is neither breathing

05:49.028 --> 05:51.747
Nor has a heartbeat.
First, finds the carotid pulse.

05:51.748 --> 05:53.987
If you are unable to palpate
the carotid pulse,

05:53.988 --> 05:56.867
Then find the apex beat
and instantly start cardiac massage.

05:56.868 --> 06:00.221
Honour - Topp.

06:13.188 --> 06:14.734
What's the topic?

06:14.948 --> 06:16.867
Oppositional Defiant Disorder,

06:16.868 --> 06:20.707
- It's a childhood
behavioural problem. - Uh-huh.

06:20.708 --> 06:22.787
You know, Mel was saying

06:22.788 --> 06:25.187
that James is struggling
a little to make friends.

06:25.188 --> 06:27.747
Perhaps he's just been selective.

06:27.748 --> 06:29.658
I am a bit concerned.

06:29.668 --> 06:32.387
He doesn't have
Oppositional Defiant Disorder.

06:32.388 --> 06:34.147
No, I'm not suggesting he does.

06:34.148 --> 06:37.347
But I can't help feeling that
something's not quite right.

06:37.348 --> 06:40.387
You know,
you're studying child development,

06:40.388 --> 06:42.787
Perhaps you're starting to
see patterns where none exist.

06:42.788 --> 06:45.347
- Are you saying I'm wrong?
- No.

06:45.348 --> 06:46.787
No, I'm saying that's very common,

06:46.788 --> 06:48.387
certainly amongst medical students

06:48.388 --> 06:49.987
for them to start
diagnosing themselves

06:49.988 --> 06:52.547
And all around them with every
illness and ailment under the sun.

06:52.548 --> 06:55.003
A little learning can be...

06:56.068 --> 06:57.667
Are you OK?

06:57.668 --> 07:00.547
Can we keep that... dog out of here?

07:00.548 --> 07:03.427
I was just about to
take him for a walk.

07:03.428 --> 07:05.611
I could do with a break.

07:05.988 --> 07:08.227
I have some medical supplies
at Mrs Tishell's,

07:08.228 --> 07:09.507
could you pick them up, please?

07:09.508 --> 07:12.387
- Yeah, no problem. Come on, Buddy.
- Thank you.

07:12.388 --> 07:17.027
Louisa, James is going to be fine.

07:17.028 --> 07:18.301
Yeah. Come on.

07:37.188 --> 07:39.268
Missing the old place?

07:39.588 --> 07:42.627
No, I'm just walking Buddy.

07:42.628 --> 07:46.147
It must be tough,
not being a teacher any more

07:46.148 --> 07:47.907
after all those years.

07:47.908 --> 07:50.147
Well, you know, I've got new
things going on in my life,

07:50.148 --> 07:52.067
- so it's actually quite exciting.
- Sure, sure.

07:52.068 --> 07:54.627
It's just, if it ever they took my
uniform away,

07:54.628 --> 07:57.507
I don't know what I do.
I'd be totally lost.

07:57.508 --> 07:59.588
Huge identity crisis.

07:59.908 --> 08:01.667
In fact you'd probably find me

08:01.668 --> 08:04.387
hanging around
outside the police station.

08:04.388 --> 08:05.987
Yeah, well, I'm not you, Joe.

08:05.988 --> 08:08.707
No, you're just walking the dog.

08:08.708 --> 08:11.107
I understand.

08:11.108 --> 08:12.108
Bye.

08:15.428 --> 08:18.147
- How long has it been like this?
- About a week.

08:18.148 --> 08:21.507
- Do you work with animals?
- Goats.

08:21.508 --> 08:23.267
We make ice cream from the milk.

08:23.268 --> 08:25.187
They're amazing animals.

08:25.188 --> 08:27.587
They are... They are far
smarter than people think.

08:27.588 --> 08:30.787
This one goat, Phillip,
I swear he got it in for me.

08:30.788 --> 08:33.187
He's just a little jealous, silly.

08:33.188 --> 08:36.547
Do you wear gloves
when working with the goat's milk?

08:36.548 --> 08:39.267
Er, no, I wash my hands
thoroughly before and after though.

08:39.268 --> 08:41.187
You dry them properly?

08:41.188 --> 08:43.907
If they're damp,
they can allow bacteria to breed.

08:43.908 --> 08:48.547
This is a whitlow, it is
an infection of the nail fold,

08:48.548 --> 08:51.639
caused by staphylococcus bacteria.

08:52.228 --> 08:55.267
I write you a prescription
for a course of antibiotics,

08:55.268 --> 09:00.547
But in the meantime, wear gloves to
protect your hand and keep it dry.

09:00.548 --> 09:04.227
We'll pick up some
gloves on the way back, then.

09:04.228 --> 09:06.592
Sit down, stop scratching.

09:07.268 --> 09:09.507
You've got a rash.

09:09.508 --> 09:12.707
Yeah, I know,
it's been there a few days.

09:12.708 --> 09:15.587
Sycosis vulgaris,
it's an infection of the beard area.

09:15.588 --> 09:18.627
Sorry, his... his beard is infected?

09:18.628 --> 09:19.907
Is that even possible?

09:19.908 --> 09:21.987
No, it's not the beard,
it's the skin underneath.

09:21.988 --> 09:24.547
It's a deep infection
of the hair follicles,

09:24.548 --> 09:28.227
Often by the Staphylococcus
aureus bacteria.

09:28.228 --> 09:31.267
There's a chance that you've been
infecting one another

09:31.268 --> 09:33.187
and the swab results will confirm.

09:33.188 --> 09:36.227
Is there much physical
contact in your relationship?

09:36.228 --> 09:39.267
- Oh, yes.
- He's worse than a goat, this one is.

09:39.268 --> 09:42.307
Right, get some antiseptic
cream from the pharmacy

09:42.308 --> 09:43.907
and shave your beard off.

09:43.908 --> 09:45.347
If I shave my beard, though,

09:45.348 --> 09:47.747
everyone will see the rash
all over my face.

09:47.748 --> 09:48.867
It's not very nice.

09:48.868 --> 09:51.107
You look run down, how's your diet?

09:51.108 --> 09:53.027
How much sleep you getting?

09:53.028 --> 09:56.387
I eat when I can,
sleep about five hours a night,

09:56.388 --> 09:58.467
there's a lot of work
to do on the farm.

09:58.468 --> 10:00.867
You should take more care
of yourself.

10:00.868 --> 10:05.347
Come back in the morning
for the results of your swab test.

10:05.348 --> 10:08.067
Uh-huh. Ah, well, that's very well.

10:08.068 --> 10:10.148
Hello, excuse me! Hi!

10:10.468 --> 10:13.507
Well, yes, of course, I just...
Erm...

10:13.508 --> 10:14.947
Yes, sorry, I'm just gonna...

10:14.948 --> 10:17.187
I'm gonna call you back,
just one sec. Yep.

10:17.188 --> 10:19.907
- Sorry, can I help you?
- You're the new head, aren't you?

10:19.908 --> 10:22.147
Lorna Argyll, yes. Sorry, you are?

10:22.148 --> 10:24.227
Louisa Ellingham, your predecessor.

10:24.228 --> 10:26.627
Oh, right! Hello!

10:26.628 --> 10:30.147
I've... I've heard about you,
obviously, but...

10:30.148 --> 10:32.547
I thought maybe
we could grab a coffee sometime,

10:32.548 --> 10:34.468
do a proper handover?

10:34.628 --> 10:37.027
Yes, yes, we should
definitely do that. Yeah, yeah.

10:37.028 --> 10:39.267
That's a great idea.

10:39.268 --> 10:40.707
Sorry, busy, busy.

10:40.708 --> 10:43.907
Yep. Oh, God, no, that certainly
needs to change. Absolutely.

10:43.908 --> 10:45.507
Oh, you're not... The thing is,

10:45.508 --> 10:47.587
I need you to listen to
me about this.

10:47.588 --> 10:51.587
So maybe sometime this week then?
Yeah? Maybe?

10:51.588 --> 10:57.187
If you can't do it yourself,
then I will do it.

10:57.188 --> 11:00.387
- Hello!
- Oh, Louisa.

11:00.388 --> 11:01.661
Morning, Ruth.

11:01.988 --> 11:03.747
Isn't it college day?

11:03.748 --> 11:05.507
Yeah, how would you know that?

11:05.508 --> 11:07.427
Well, you probably mentioned
it before.

11:07.428 --> 11:10.147
Well, actually, we're doing it
over Skype today, so...

11:10.148 --> 11:12.067
- I don't know what that is.
- Erm...

11:12.068 --> 11:14.947
Well, it's sort of a phone call,
but on... on video.

11:14.948 --> 11:16.707
Oh, oh, I see, right.

11:16.708 --> 11:19.107
Oh, I thought you were doing
a proper college course.

11:19.108 --> 11:21.667
I'd just like to pick up
Martin's medical supplies,

11:21.668 --> 11:26.748
- please, Mrs Tishell.
- Any word yet?

11:26.948 --> 11:29.494
Erm, a letter arrived today.

11:29.668 --> 11:32.547
Erm, and they want Martin to do
some training courses.

11:32.548 --> 11:35.276
I imagine that went down well.

11:36.708 --> 11:37.890
Hello, Sally.

11:38.628 --> 11:41.507
Oh, you're the large cousin,
been in Spain.

11:41.508 --> 11:43.600
Very good, Miles Green.

11:43.748 --> 11:46.385
See you still got the neck...

11:46.468 --> 11:48.547
Yeah, you should see
the doc about that.

11:48.548 --> 11:50.307
- Yeah, you should see the doc about that.
- How can I help you?

11:50.308 --> 11:58.116
A prescription for me and antiseptic
cream for Miles, thank you.

11:59.748 --> 12:02.627
Nothing like a warm welcome home.

12:02.628 --> 12:05.667
Well, obviously,
he's not happy about it.

12:05.668 --> 12:07.305
I don't blame him.

12:07.428 --> 12:09.027
He's going to comply
though, isn't he?

12:09.028 --> 12:10.787
Well, he says he is.

12:10.788 --> 12:12.067
I'm sure everything will be fine.

12:12.068 --> 12:14.787
Yes, it's just training courses.

12:14.788 --> 12:16.707
Just needs to grit his teeth
and get on with it.

12:16.708 --> 12:18.254
Yeah, no problem.

12:19.588 --> 12:21.667
- Maybe I should have a word with him.
- Just in case.

12:21.668 --> 12:22.668
Good idea.

12:31.808 --> 12:35.167
You had an appointment two days ago,
why didn't you come?

12:35.168 --> 12:36.927
It's been a busy time.

12:36.928 --> 12:39.167
The school want me to
have a pre-employment medical.

12:39.168 --> 12:42.687
- It's just a formality, really.
- Mm, I know.

12:42.688 --> 12:44.607
Well, your blood pressure's fine.

12:44.608 --> 12:51.961
Great, you can sign off
on the insurance certificate, then.

12:52.128 --> 12:54.674
Your pulse rate's high, 170.

12:55.008 --> 12:56.607
Oh, sorry, what are you doing?

12:56.608 --> 12:59.327
I'm checking your thyroid to see
why your pulse rate's so high.

12:59.328 --> 13:00.927
I'll need to do a blood test.

13:00.928 --> 13:03.327
- Well, that's not part
of the medical. - Yes, it is.

13:03.328 --> 13:05.567
I think there's been some
sort of misunderstanding.

13:05.568 --> 13:08.287
I don't want an actual full-blown
check-up, just check the eyes,

13:08.288 --> 13:09.887
the ears, pat on the head
and off you go.

13:09.888 --> 13:11.647
I need to rule out
any thyroid concerns.

13:11.648 --> 13:15.167
- Come back tomorrow for your
blood results. - I'm very busy.

13:15.168 --> 13:17.887
Nevertheless, I won't sign off
on your insurance certificate

13:17.888 --> 13:24.696
Unless you come back
for your blood results tomorrow.

13:28.128 --> 13:31.327
The reported figures
for Oppositional Defiant Disorder

13:31.328 --> 13:35.167
are between 1 and 16% of children
in the general population.

13:35.168 --> 13:40.127
Sorry, when you stand on the whole
nature versus nurture debate?

13:40.128 --> 13:42.367
Er, that's a fairly broad topic.

13:42.368 --> 13:46.847
OK, well, erm, say there's
a child and one of his, or her,

13:46.848 --> 13:51.327
parents is, erm, outgoing
and empathetic and things.

13:51.328 --> 13:54.047
And the other has...

13:54.048 --> 13:57.247
less clearly-defined social skills.

13:57.248 --> 13:59.327
If that child takes after
one parent,

13:59.328 --> 14:04.287
so the less socially-skilled one,
do you think that's a genetic code

14:04.288 --> 14:06.527
that's hard-wired into him, or her,

14:06.528 --> 14:09.087
or could the right
behavioural adjustments

14:09.088 --> 14:11.327
create a more compassionate child...

14:11.328 --> 14:15.601
- Sorry, subject?
- Uh, that's quite a question.

14:15.968 --> 14:19.007
So, if you, say, forced the child
to have some play dates

14:19.008 --> 14:22.527
with other children, it might just
teach him how to socialise better?

14:22.528 --> 14:27.007
Sorry, Louisa, is this in reference
to Oppositional Defiant Disorder?

14:27.008 --> 14:28.099
Yeah. Mm-hm.

14:29.088 --> 14:31.452
It's an interesting angle.

14:31.488 --> 14:32.852
I suppose, yes.

14:32.928 --> 14:37.247
The question is whether it would
have a positive or negative effect.

14:37.248 --> 14:40.127
So you're saying
that could make him worse?

14:40.128 --> 14:43.167
Yes, look, why don't we come
back to this in Truro next week

14:43.168 --> 14:46.527
and we could focus
back on the topic in hand.

14:46.528 --> 14:50.367
Yeah, yeah, of course, it can wait.
It's just a query. That's all.

14:50.368 --> 14:51.368
So, ODD...

14:56.608 --> 15:00.127
Hello, Martin,
have you got a moment?

15:00.128 --> 15:01.765
Is anything wrong?

15:02.048 --> 15:03.647
It's a social visit.

15:03.648 --> 15:05.831
Oh, I see. Right, hello.

15:06.368 --> 15:10.047
Also, I heard that you
got your instructions from the GMC.

15:10.048 --> 15:12.607
Oh, I see,
so you're checking up on me.

15:12.608 --> 15:13.790
More or less.

15:14.208 --> 15:15.967
What are they asking you to do?

15:15.968 --> 15:18.207
Oh, they want me
to attend three courses.

15:18.208 --> 15:21.727
I have to assist
at a surgical procedure,

15:21.728 --> 15:23.007
run a mock surgery

15:23.008 --> 15:27.167
And attend a phlebotomy course
that's on Thursday at Truro.

15:27.168 --> 15:28.767
- And attend a phlebotomy course that's on Thursday at Truro.
- You are going to attend, aren't you?

15:28.768 --> 15:30.527
Well, they haven't given me
much choice.

15:30.528 --> 15:34.207
You'll be drawing blood in front
of a room full of people.

15:34.208 --> 15:35.167
Have you thought about

15:35.168 --> 15:37.247
how you're going to deal
with your haemophobia?

15:37.248 --> 15:39.167
Yes, of course I have.

15:39.168 --> 15:42.207
There are desensitisation exercises,
you know?

15:42.208 --> 15:44.447
I'd be happy to run
through them with you.

15:44.448 --> 15:46.527
Why are you washing your hands
again?

15:46.528 --> 15:48.287
- Why are you washing your hands again?
- Er... Erm... I'm not.

15:48.288 --> 15:51.007
Anyway, thank you for your
concern, it's really not necessary.

15:51.008 --> 15:52.767
If you'll forgive me,
I have patience to see.

15:52.768 --> 15:53.768
Morwenna!

15:56.448 --> 15:59.007
I'll have the steak and kidney pie.

15:59.008 --> 16:00.767
There's a special on desserts.

16:00.768 --> 16:02.527
I wouldn't say no,
what have you got?

16:02.528 --> 16:05.567
- Goat ice cream, it's very popular.
- No.

16:05.568 --> 16:07.387
Oi, nobody wants it.

16:07.488 --> 16:11.167
As soon as you put the word goat
with ice cream, it's a no sale.

16:11.168 --> 16:13.087
I told you not to go into business
with Miles.

16:13.088 --> 16:15.807
He was always meant to be the
most successful one in the family.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.567
Yeah, now his successes
are taking up room

16:17.568 --> 16:19.647
in our freezer
that we can't afford.

16:19.648 --> 16:21.407
Don't worry, your barmaid's arrived.

16:21.408 --> 16:23.807
Hey, I put up a new
ad today for the job.

16:23.808 --> 16:25.567
Fingers crossed someone bites.

16:25.568 --> 16:29.087
Right, so if we're not doing May,
when are you thinking then?

16:29.088 --> 16:31.361
- For what?
- The wedding.

16:31.488 --> 16:34.687
Oh, erm, I don't know,
I haven't really thought about it.

16:34.688 --> 16:37.887
Of course not.

16:37.888 --> 16:39.807
But, well,
maybe I could help you

16:39.808 --> 16:42.207
with that CPR thing,
you know, training?

16:42.208 --> 16:44.447
I could test you, or whatever.

16:44.448 --> 16:47.487
It's quite a commitment,
are you sure you'll have the time?

16:47.488 --> 16:51.167
- Oh, come on, Morwenna.
- Shall we have that discussion?

16:51.168 --> 16:54.367
- What discussion, Joe?
- About the best man position?

16:54.368 --> 16:57.567
Officially confirming me
in the role.

16:57.568 --> 16:59.967
Well, I hadn't really
thought about it, mate.

16:59.968 --> 17:01.247
Oh, that's a surprise.

17:01.248 --> 17:04.767
Al, this isn't like the proposal,
you gotta think about these things.

17:04.768 --> 17:06.686
What you mean by that?

17:06.688 --> 17:10.063
No, it's just...

17:11.328 --> 17:13.146
Al's proposal was...

17:13.407 --> 17:15.487
Al's proposal was what?

17:15.488 --> 17:17.215
Well, it's nothing.

17:17.248 --> 17:19.327
It didn't sound like nothing.

17:19.334 --> 17:22.002
It's just...
It's just Joe being Joe.

17:22.003 --> 17:24.767
That's right, it's just me being me.

17:24.768 --> 17:28.287
- Yeah.
- Good old Joe being...

17:28.288 --> 17:29.288
Joe.

17:33.088 --> 17:37.087
You did mean it, right?
The proposal.

17:37.088 --> 17:38.687
Morwenna, why would you say that?

17:38.688 --> 17:40.325
Well, it's just...

17:40.768 --> 17:45.087
It seemed to come as a bit of
a surprise to you, as well, and...

17:45.088 --> 17:47.487
If you've made a mistake,
now is the time to back out.

17:47.488 --> 17:49.887
Before it all goes too far.

17:49.888 --> 17:54.968
No, no, of course I meant it. OK?

17:57.408 --> 18:01.408
Maybe we could organise a play date.

18:02.208 --> 18:04.607
How about with Colin Towns?

18:04.608 --> 18:07.807
- You like him, don't you?
- No, thank you.

18:07.808 --> 18:08.899
Yes, you do.

18:09.248 --> 18:11.249
What about with Miles?

18:11.968 --> 18:15.321
No, thank you.

18:16.288 --> 18:18.527
Tell you what, why don't you
pick someone and tell me

18:18.528 --> 18:20.287
who you'd like to
have a play date with?

18:20.288 --> 18:22.847
No, thank you.

18:22.848 --> 18:25.887
OK.

18:25.888 --> 18:28.447
It's school time,
you should be going on now.

18:28.448 --> 18:30.267
Come on, here we go.

18:30.528 --> 18:32.767
Bye-bye!

18:32.768 --> 18:33.768
Bye!

18:36.928 --> 18:38.687
- Morning!
- Morning.

18:38.688 --> 18:41.247
- You missing us yet?
- Well, of course.

18:41.248 --> 18:43.647
But not on sailing days,
I don't miss that.

18:43.648 --> 18:46.367
- Oh, that all stopped.
- Really? Why's that?

18:46.368 --> 18:49.087
- Well, Lorna got rid of it.
- She can't just get rid of it.

18:49.088 --> 18:50.687
It's a key part of their week.

18:50.688 --> 18:53.567
No-one hated it more than me,
but I still had to do it.

18:53.568 --> 18:55.647
She's changed your office
and schedules.

18:55.648 --> 18:58.207
- She's done her own timetables.
- What?

18:58.208 --> 19:01.087
- Well, can I see the new one?
- Oh, no, that's classified.

19:01.088 --> 19:03.327
We're not allowed
to share it with parents.

19:03.328 --> 19:04.328
Pippa!

19:05.088 --> 19:10.367
- Pippa, you got a minute?
- Coming! Out of my hands.

19:10.368 --> 19:13.887
Well, you'll be pleased to learn
that we can rule out thyrotoxicosis.

19:13.888 --> 19:15.798
Thyrotoxicosis is...?

19:15.968 --> 19:18.687
An excess of the thyroid hormone.

19:18.688 --> 19:21.887
You were displaying symptoms of
someone with an over active thyroid.

19:21.888 --> 19:24.287
- But the test is negative.
- Well, that's good then.

19:24.288 --> 19:26.207
Well, as far as thyrotoxicosis goes.

19:26.208 --> 19:29.299
But your pulse rate is still high.

19:29.408 --> 19:32.127
- Have you lost any weight recently?
- A little, yes.

19:32.128 --> 19:33.887
I've been in training
for a half marathon.

19:33.888 --> 19:35.980
I'd like to run an ECG.

19:36.128 --> 19:39.807
An ECG? I just need you to sign
off on the insurance certificate.

19:39.808 --> 19:42.367
Yes, I'm aware of that, but you
have an abnormally high heart rate,

19:42.368 --> 19:44.607
And I need to take that seriously
because I'm a doctor.

19:44.608 --> 19:47.167
- What you mean seriously?
- What you mean, "What do you mean?"

19:47.168 --> 19:49.407
You are a seemingly fit,
healthy young woman

19:49.408 --> 19:51.167
with an abnormally high heart rate.

19:51.168 --> 19:53.727
An ECG may well indicate
what's causing that,

19:53.728 --> 19:56.127
Until I've investigated it,
I won't sign off on anything.

19:56.128 --> 19:59.765
No, I need to get
back to meetings today.

20:00.128 --> 20:02.687
Right, make another appointment.

20:02.688 --> 20:03.870
Next patient!

20:10.528 --> 20:12.927
I need an appointment
for tomorrow afternoon.

20:12.928 --> 20:15.167
Oh, we're closed
tomorrow afternoon.

20:15.168 --> 20:16.767
I can give you Friday at nine?

20:16.768 --> 20:19.007
If that's the best you can do, yes.

20:19.008 --> 20:20.463
Oh, hello again.

20:22.208 --> 20:23.208
Louisa.

20:23.968 --> 20:26.367
- Ellingham.
- Oh, of course, yes.

20:26.368 --> 20:28.287
- Good to see you again.
- Um, sorry,

20:28.288 --> 20:31.807
It's just I hear you've been making
lots of changes at the school.

20:31.808 --> 20:35.647
And I'd love to be able to schedule
that handover meeting we discussed.

20:35.648 --> 20:39.967
Yes.
Yes, we should definitely do that.

20:39.968 --> 20:42.527
Sorry, I've got to dash
back to work.

20:42.528 --> 20:45.165
- You know how it is.
- Mm-hm.

20:49.408 --> 20:53.407
Miles, this ice cream
might be all the rage in London,

20:53.408 --> 20:56.607
but my customers
just aren't going for it.

20:56.608 --> 20:57.887
It's only been a day.

20:57.888 --> 21:00.287
It's already running joke
in the pub,

21:00.288 --> 21:03.007
they're calling the place
The Goat And Lobster.

21:03.008 --> 21:07.644
I'm sorry, Miles,
but small villages, small palates.

21:07.808 --> 21:10.047
Here, was this on your face?

21:10.048 --> 21:12.231
Oh, cream. I got a rash.

21:13.088 --> 21:16.127
- Nasty.
- It'll be fine.

21:16.128 --> 21:18.687
This is what you swapped Spain for?

21:18.688 --> 21:20.287
Oh, it's better than it looks.

21:20.288 --> 21:22.367
So what actually
happened over there?

21:22.368 --> 21:24.287
I heard you were
setting up a gardening business.

21:24.288 --> 21:27.807
Yeah, didn't quite work out.

21:27.808 --> 21:30.847
Tried a lot of things out there,
but just couldn't get a break.

21:30.848 --> 21:34.047
- Oh, I know the feeling with that one.
- Mm.

21:34.048 --> 21:36.127
Thought my luck
was never gonna change.

21:36.128 --> 21:38.207
- Thought my luck - was never gonna change.
- It was when I met Shirley and, erm...

21:38.208 --> 21:39.807
It was when I met Shirley
and, erm...

21:39.808 --> 21:45.887
Well, maybe I exaggerated
how successful I was in business.

21:45.888 --> 21:51.434
- Ah, come on, I'd better get
this back in the freezers. - OK.

21:54.688 --> 21:57.887
No, Phillip, you're already fed.
No, back off.

21:57.888 --> 21:59.967
It's her prize goat,
swear he's got it in for me.

21:59.968 --> 22:02.687
No, Phillip. Go!

22:02.688 --> 22:06.314
Phillip! Phillip!

22:07.008 --> 22:13.087
- He's jealous of our happiness!
Aren't you, bad goat? - Here!

22:13.088 --> 22:17.088
Here, Miles, are you all right?

22:17.408 --> 22:18.499
No, I'm not.

22:19.488 --> 22:21.567
- No, I'm not.
- I'm out of shape, face like a pizza.

22:21.568 --> 22:23.647
I'm out of shape, face like a pizza.

22:23.648 --> 22:26.687
I love Shirley,
I don't want to lose her.

22:26.688 --> 22:29.416
Let's get you inside, come on.

22:33.088 --> 22:35.362
Mil... Miles, are you OK?

22:35.968 --> 22:37.727
It's that bloody goat again.

22:37.728 --> 22:40.127
He's just jealous.

22:40.128 --> 22:41.887
He knows what we get up to.

22:41.888 --> 22:44.927
We are very compatible, physically.

22:44.928 --> 22:49.567
I didn't really need to know that.

22:49.568 --> 22:51.807
Oh, er...

22:51.808 --> 22:54.047
You're returning the ice cream?

22:54.048 --> 22:55.487
It wasn't for us.

22:55.488 --> 22:59.007
I'm sorry, but I'm sure there'll be
lots of people that like it.

22:59.008 --> 23:00.827
No, they already do.

23:01.568 --> 23:03.660
Go on, tell him, Miles.

23:04.928 --> 23:05.928
Miles.

23:06.208 --> 23:10.207
Well, I've rung round a few people
and we definitely got some orders.

23:10.208 --> 23:12.767
I just didn't want your expectations
to get too high.

23:12.768 --> 23:15.007
- So how many orders have we got?
- Don't worry about it.

23:15.008 --> 23:18.047
- Well, I am a little worried now.
- It's an acquired taste.

23:18.048 --> 23:19.327
You said you contacted people.

23:19.328 --> 23:21.887
I did, they just didn't want it.

23:21.888 --> 23:23.967
So how many orders have we got?

23:23.968 --> 23:26.527
Well...

23:26.528 --> 23:27.528
none.

23:28.448 --> 23:30.847
But don't worry,
I'll turn this around.

23:30.848 --> 23:33.087
When were you planning on
telling me this?

23:33.088 --> 23:35.647
- I was protecting you!
- No, you do not put that on me.

23:35.648 --> 23:38.285
You were protecting yourself.

23:39.488 --> 23:43.647
You lied to me, how could you?

23:43.648 --> 23:47.167
I'm sure she didn't mean it, Miles,
you got to take it easy.

23:47.168 --> 23:49.078
You're no help, Bert.

23:49.088 --> 23:51.487
One bloody case, that's all I asked.

23:51.488 --> 23:52.488
Go on.

24:03.008 --> 24:04.372
Where is James?

24:04.928 --> 24:07.647
Up in his room, playing on his own.

24:07.648 --> 24:09.407
He's actually on one side

24:09.408 --> 24:11.327
and all his teddy bears
are on the other.

24:11.328 --> 24:15.807
There was an article in here
I think you might find interesting.

24:15.808 --> 24:18.847
- Child Psychology Now.
- Yes, it's a well-known journal.

24:18.848 --> 24:23.223
Hm, I've never heard of it.

24:24.128 --> 24:27.167
- They've spelt projectile wrong.
- Yes, it's a misprint.

24:27.168 --> 24:30.367
Maybe you could just focus on
the content, rather than the form.

24:30.368 --> 24:32.127
It's about only-child syndrome.

24:32.128 --> 24:35.167
Well, it's opinion. It's not
an actual clinical diagnosis.

24:35.168 --> 24:37.407
Well, it states
that in the majority of cases,

24:37.408 --> 24:38.687
those with brothers or sisters

24:38.688 --> 24:41.247
assimilate better with their peers,
than those without.

24:41.248 --> 24:45.087
From a very small study group,
it's not conclusive.

24:45.088 --> 24:47.647
You know,
I see James in the playground.

24:47.648 --> 24:50.687
And all the other children
they're playing together

24:50.688 --> 24:55.167
and James is always on the outside,
he's always isolated.

24:55.168 --> 24:59.647
And, yes, he might be a little shy,
but... this does seem to fit.

24:59.648 --> 25:01.740
You were an only child.

25:01.888 --> 25:02.888
Well, yeah.

25:03.008 --> 25:07.327
Does this diagnosis fit
with how you see your childhood?

25:07.328 --> 25:08.328
No.

25:10.048 --> 25:12.287
Didn't you used to feel
a little bit lonely as a child?

25:12.288 --> 25:14.106
- I know I did.
- No.

25:14.368 --> 25:17.727
I used to have imaginary friends,
Big Sue and Sarah.

25:17.728 --> 25:19.967
- Really?
- Mm.

25:19.968 --> 25:22.423
- Didn't you have any?
- No.

25:25.888 --> 25:28.071
I should check on James.

26:02.516 --> 26:03.516
Morning.

26:06.196 --> 26:07.196
You OK?

26:07.636 --> 26:10.515
You been really quiet
since yesterday.

26:10.516 --> 26:12.755
- Have I?
- Yeah.

26:12.756 --> 26:17.075
Why don't we have a nice dinner
tonight or something? I'll cook.

26:17.076 --> 26:20.115
And we can talk about the wedding
and I could help you with this,

26:20.116 --> 26:21.555
you know, CPR training.

26:21.556 --> 26:24.115
You don't have to,
not if you don't want to.

26:24.116 --> 26:26.835
- No, I do.
- Besides, I know how this goes,

26:26.836 --> 26:30.195
We make plans and then you say
how you're busy with work.

26:30.196 --> 26:31.742
Well, I won't be.

26:32.276 --> 26:34.995
- Have you found new staff?
- Not yet.

26:34.996 --> 26:38.675
So how are you going to take
the evening off?

26:38.676 --> 26:40.915
- I'll find someone.
- By tonight?

26:40.916 --> 26:42.462
Morwenna, I will.

26:43.156 --> 26:44.156
All right.

26:46.996 --> 26:48.269
See you later.

26:55.796 --> 26:57.715
Has your friend
shaved his beard off?

26:57.716 --> 26:58.675
No, of course not.

26:58.676 --> 27:01.075
No, that would mean doing
something the smart way.

27:01.076 --> 27:03.795
No. Instead, he's just put cream
all over it.

27:03.796 --> 27:06.675
The cream won't be effective
unless he shaves.

27:06.676 --> 27:09.395
I got your test results back
and as I suspected,

27:09.396 --> 27:12.435
You both have a staphylococcal
infection.

27:12.436 --> 27:15.155
You are infecting him every time
you touch him with your finger

27:15.156 --> 27:19.475
And he in turn is re-infecting you
with his beard.

27:19.476 --> 27:22.515
So, what? We both have that
staphylococcal bacteria thing,

27:22.516 --> 27:24.699
but only he's got the...

27:24.756 --> 27:26.515
Sycosis vulgaris, yes.

27:26.516 --> 27:29.075
You are constantly reinfecting
one another

27:29.076 --> 27:31.475
With a bacterial infection
and that has got to stop.

27:31.476 --> 27:34.035
- Yeah, well, that won't be a problem.
- Good.

27:34.036 --> 27:36.115
Leave the dressing off,
let the air get to it,

27:36.116 --> 27:38.675
wear gloves for protection.
Finish the course of antibiotics

27:38.676 --> 27:41.395
and tell, erm, what's-his-name
to come in to the surgery

27:41.396 --> 27:45.395
And pick up a prescription.

27:45.396 --> 27:46.578
Next patient!

27:51.476 --> 27:53.022
- Morning.
- What?

27:53.236 --> 27:54.995
You're bright and cheery.

27:54.996 --> 27:57.395
Erm, Dad,
can you look after the pub tonight?

27:57.396 --> 27:58.995
Not on my own, no.

27:58.996 --> 28:01.075
Oh, please,
I need to fix things with Morwenna.

28:01.076 --> 28:04.275
- Why, what have you done now?
- Well, it's complicated.

28:04.276 --> 28:07.155
I hear there's a position available.

28:07.156 --> 28:10.035
- What, you want to work here?
- I do, yes.

28:10.036 --> 28:12.755
I'm at a little bit
of a loose end in the evenings.

28:12.756 --> 28:14.675
Maybe you should join
a club or society.

28:14.676 --> 28:16.755
I've been hearing
the book club's very popular.

28:16.756 --> 28:21.715
Oh, for my sins, I find work
is the best kind of relaxation.

28:21.716 --> 28:25.395
Here is my CV,
with numerous references.

28:25.396 --> 28:28.755
A lot of them
are from napkin companies,

28:28.756 --> 28:31.635
due to me having stakes
in the serviette industry.

28:31.636 --> 28:34.195
Oh.

28:34.196 --> 28:36.595
Well, I'll need to think about it.

28:36.596 --> 28:39.475
I've thought about it, you're hired.
Can you start tonight?

28:39.476 --> 28:43.315
Of course.
Oh, won't this be great, Bert?

28:43.316 --> 28:46.195
The two of us, working together,
side-by-side again!

28:46.196 --> 28:47.196
Super!

28:50.516 --> 28:54.035
That was your last patient,
you're all good to go to Truro.

28:54.036 --> 28:55.673
Oh, before you go,

28:56.116 --> 29:00.115
am I meant to practice CPR
on a dummy or a real person?

29:00.116 --> 29:02.675
Either will do, it doesn't matter.

29:02.676 --> 29:04.755
Portwenn Surgery.

29:04.756 --> 29:06.675
Er, yeah, OK. Slow down.

29:06.676 --> 29:12.120
Doc, it's Mrs Knott,
it sounds urgent.

29:13.236 --> 29:14.236
Yes?

29:14.516 --> 29:20.756
Doc? Doc, I just come home and
I found Miles, he's just lying here.

29:20.916 --> 29:24.595
He's struggling for breath,
I can't even get him to stand up.

29:24.596 --> 29:26.195
Any other symptoms?

29:26.196 --> 29:29.555
Yeah, he said he had
a tingling in his legs,

29:29.556 --> 29:31.475
I think he's getting worse.

29:31.476 --> 29:32.595
What's their address?

29:32.596 --> 29:34.995
Pendennick Farm,
it's on your way to the hospital.

29:34.996 --> 29:38.195
Fine, I'll be about 20 minutes.

29:38.196 --> 29:40.742
- What's her name?
- Shirley.

29:40.756 --> 29:43.475
- Good luck with the course.
- Yes.

29:43.476 --> 29:47.920
OK, yeah, he's on his way.

30:02.676 --> 30:05.875
- Where is he?
- He's this way. Quick now.

30:05.876 --> 30:07.315
Oh, no, God, no. Careful.

30:07.316 --> 30:09.075
That's Phillip,
he's a bit territorial.

30:09.076 --> 30:10.835
Well, keep it away from me.

30:10.836 --> 30:13.291
Go on, off with you, go on.

30:14.676 --> 30:15.676
Hello.

30:16.276 --> 30:17.276
Mr... Er...

30:20.596 --> 30:21.875
His pulse is racing.

30:21.876 --> 30:24.435
You said he was complaining
of a tingling sensation in his legs.

30:24.436 --> 30:26.528
Pins and needles, yeah.

30:27.316 --> 30:29.075
What is wrong with him?

30:29.076 --> 30:31.795
The swab test confirmed
the sycosis vulgaris,

30:31.796 --> 30:33.395
but I'm worried,
with the pins and needles,

30:33.396 --> 30:34.675
and the tightness of breath,

30:34.676 --> 30:37.075
That it's progressed to
Guillain-Barre polyneuropathy.

30:37.076 --> 30:39.155
- Guillain...?
- Barre. It's very rare,

30:39.156 --> 30:40.915
very serious nerve condition.

30:40.916 --> 30:42.675
Of course, he wouldn't be
in this position

30:42.676 --> 30:46.835
- If he'd taken my advice and
shaved his beard. - Oh, God.

30:46.836 --> 30:48.595
Well, there isn't time
to get an ambulance.

30:48.596 --> 30:54.858
I'll drive him to the hospital.
Help me get up.

30:57.556 --> 30:59.466
Is this all my fault?

30:59.476 --> 31:02.195
Well, no, the follicle infection
acted as a trigger.

31:02.196 --> 31:05.235
It depends on
an individual's metabolism.

31:05.236 --> 31:09.395
Normally, the immune system attacks
any germs that get into the body.

31:09.396 --> 31:11.955
But with people with Guillain-Barre,

31:11.956 --> 31:14.515
It mistakenly attacks
and damages nerves.

31:14.516 --> 31:16.755
I don't... I don't really
understand any of that.

31:16.756 --> 31:19.666
It doesn't matter, lie him flat.

31:27.316 --> 31:31.124
- Right, lay flat.
- OK.

31:32.436 --> 31:33.875
You ride in the back here with him,

31:33.876 --> 31:37.875
- keep him still and hold
that on his face. - OK.

31:37.876 --> 31:39.795
You pull the strap over his head.

31:39.796 --> 31:42.195
Put... Put the strap
around his head,

31:42.196 --> 31:43.955
keep his airway unblocked.

31:43.956 --> 31:44.956
Oh!

32:00.116 --> 32:02.480
Patient needs ventilating.

32:05.556 --> 32:10.636
Right, have you got him?

32:11.796 --> 32:13.875
I'm here, Miles,
I'm not going anywhere.

32:13.876 --> 32:15.240
- Sorry.
- What?

32:15.316 --> 32:18.195
- I'm sorry.
- It doesn't matter about that now.

32:18.196 --> 32:20.469
- Oh, God!
- Stop talking.

32:35.956 --> 32:38.835
So the course will take
approximately three hours

32:38.836 --> 32:42.195
and will cover all aspects of the...

32:42.196 --> 32:43.742
Doctor Ellingham.

32:43.956 --> 32:46.195
Obviously, not a believer
in punctuality.

32:46.196 --> 32:52.549
- I have an emergency with a patient.
- Take a seat.

32:52.596 --> 32:54.415
Right, we can begin.

32:55.476 --> 32:59.315
Now, while you are very
well-qualified people,

32:59.316 --> 33:02.675
you have nevertheless all been
selected for varying reasons

33:02.676 --> 33:05.395
to go through this refresher course.

33:05.396 --> 33:09.715
So however irritating or basic
you might find this,

33:09.716 --> 33:12.595
I would like you to pay close
attention to what we're doing.

33:12.596 --> 33:13.869
Any questions?

33:14.516 --> 33:16.275
In that case, let's crack on.

33:16.276 --> 33:20.435
Now, what do we mean by phlebotomy?

33:20.436 --> 33:23.155
The drawing of blood by means
of a venepuncture.

33:23.156 --> 33:29.873
Very good. Doctor Ellingham,
why don't you go first?

33:32.436 --> 33:34.164
What are you doing?

33:34.196 --> 33:35.955
Going to prepare
the needle and the syringe.

33:35.956 --> 33:38.355
No, no, you're not the doctor,
you're the patient,

33:38.356 --> 33:40.755
It's a role-play.

33:40.756 --> 33:42.035
Is that really necessary?

33:42.036 --> 33:44.595
It is important to understand
both sides of the coin.

33:44.596 --> 33:47.315
Doctor Khan,
you seem to know what you're doing,

33:47.316 --> 33:48.435
why don't you come up here

33:48.436 --> 33:54.995
and work through the process of
taking Doctor Ellingham's blood?

33:54.996 --> 33:55.996
Sit down.

34:08.824 --> 34:09.824
Hi!

34:10.583 --> 34:11.583
Hi, Louisa.

34:14.103 --> 34:16.023
See if you can get rid
of those windows.

34:16.024 --> 34:22.195
Can you knock them out, actually?
Repainting.

34:59.384 --> 35:00.384
Go ahead.

35:02.264 --> 35:05.303
Right, can you make
sure your sleeve is up...?

35:05.304 --> 35:08.183
- Yes.
- You've forgotten the details.

35:08.184 --> 35:09.783
- Sorry?
- Doctor Martin Ellingham,

35:09.784 --> 35:13.784
22 Manor Road, Portwenn,
Cornwall, PL27 3GG.

35:14.264 --> 35:17.143
Wait, you're
THE Doctor Martin Ellingham?

35:17.144 --> 35:20.983
- From Imperial? The surgeon, right?
- Yes.

35:20.984 --> 35:22.439
You're a legend!

35:23.064 --> 35:27.703
I'm down from there on placement,
I can't wait to tell them.

35:27.704 --> 35:30.743
- How come you're doing a
phlebotomy course? - Doctor Khan.

35:30.744 --> 35:33.824
Yes. Erm...

35:34.104 --> 35:36.343
Now, OK. Woo!

35:36.344 --> 35:39.223
I'm going to place
this tourniquet on you.

35:39.224 --> 35:40.823
The sleeve isn't above the elbow.

35:40.824 --> 35:41.824
I got it.

35:42.264 --> 35:44.503
Excellent.

35:44.504 --> 35:49.623
I'm going to place this tourniquet
on you and see if I can find a vein.

35:49.624 --> 35:53.463
I have had a few issues with that,
hence why I'm here.

35:53.464 --> 35:56.503
Once I have located a suitable vein,

35:56.504 --> 36:00.504
I will insert the needle
and take the blood.

36:00.824 --> 36:02.103
Hopefully!

36:02.104 --> 36:05.783
OK, stop, before you do any of this,
you have to calm the patient.

36:05.784 --> 36:08.343
- I'm fine.
- He's fine.

36:08.344 --> 36:11.383
- Calm the patient!
- Do you feel calm?

36:11.384 --> 36:13.943
- Yes, of course I do.
- Right.

36:13.944 --> 36:17.410
Erm... Excellent.

36:24.184 --> 36:29.992
I think we need to
talk it through, Pippa.

36:42.584 --> 36:45.623
Is there such a thing
as too much focus on pastoral?

36:45.624 --> 36:47.063
I'll make us a cup of tea.

36:47.064 --> 36:48.503
This is a small village school,

36:48.504 --> 36:51.063
children don't have
the same behavioural problems

36:51.064 --> 36:52.183
as they do in this city.

36:52.184 --> 36:55.703
Why is there water all over my desk?

36:55.704 --> 36:58.743
Mrs Ellingham always believed
that schooling should be rounded

36:58.744 --> 37:00.983
Instead of aimed
entirely at SATS results.

37:00.984 --> 37:03.223
Well, isn't that exactly
why the school isn't performing

37:03.224 --> 37:04.823
as well as it should be?

37:04.824 --> 37:07.543
Where is my timetable?
I left it right here.

37:07.544 --> 37:11.908
Never mind, I've got some
spares in the cupboard.

37:13.304 --> 37:18.566
- Louisa?
- It's not what it looks like.

37:19.864 --> 37:21.143
Right, let's see.

37:21.144 --> 37:24.503
The vein, now, where are you?

37:24.504 --> 37:25.777
Where are you?

37:30.744 --> 37:32.654
Two millimetres down.

37:41.144 --> 37:42.144
Here we go.

37:47.064 --> 37:49.623
- One moment.
- Doctor Ellingham!

37:49.624 --> 37:50.624
Louisa?

37:52.664 --> 37:53.846
Are you sure?

37:54.104 --> 37:56.503
- Right, I'm on my way.
- On your way?

37:56.504 --> 37:57.783
I have an emergency.

37:57.784 --> 37:59.863
You're in the middle of a course.

37:59.864 --> 38:04.183
- I'm a doctor.
- Doctor Ellingham!

38:04.184 --> 38:06.423
Legend!

38:06.424 --> 38:09.303
- Martin's on his way.
- Why were you hiding in her office?

38:09.304 --> 38:12.663
Hm? What? I wasn't, I was...
Well, I...

38:12.664 --> 38:14.423
I came to say hello,
nobody was here, so...

38:14.424 --> 38:16.663
Pippa, do we really
have to talk about this right now?

38:16.664 --> 38:18.423
Could you move your knee? OK.

38:18.424 --> 38:25.686
Should you be doing that?
You already made her faint once.

38:32.824 --> 38:33.824
Hello.

38:34.584 --> 38:35.584
I'm here.

38:41.304 --> 38:43.032
What are you doing?

38:44.504 --> 38:46.103
- I'm trying to help.
- It's... Er...

38:46.104 --> 38:48.343
Her heart's beating,
she's breathing,

38:48.344 --> 38:52.663
- It's a cardiac event,
not a cardiac arrest. - Oh.

38:52.664 --> 38:55.223
- Get some cold water.
- Right.

38:55.224 --> 38:56.224
Oh!

38:59.224 --> 39:00.224
Oh!

39:00.533 --> 39:03.068
- What are you doing?
- Wasn't that what you wanted?

39:03.070 --> 39:04.663
No!

39:04.664 --> 39:08.023
I need to stimulate the vagus nerve.

39:08.024 --> 39:10.423
And try and get her heart beat
back to normal.

39:10.424 --> 39:12.183
Her pulse is raging.

39:12.184 --> 39:15.863
She may have had a supraventricular
tachycardia episode.

39:15.864 --> 39:17.943
So does that mean
she's got a heart condition?

39:17.944 --> 39:20.983
Yeah, her heart starts to race
and then, very abruptly,

39:20.984 --> 39:24.183
Slows down, or stops.

39:24.184 --> 39:28.983
She was too busy and too annoying
to let me give her an ECG.

39:28.984 --> 39:32.984
Hello, you've had
a super electrical attack.

39:33.784 --> 39:36.023
- Can you hear me, Linda?
- Lorna.

39:36.024 --> 39:37.024
Yes.

39:37.784 --> 39:39.703
You were hiding in my cupboard.

39:39.704 --> 39:44.988
No, no,
I just popped by to say hello.

39:47.544 --> 39:49.463
Oh, oh, Doctor,
I wanted to say to you...

39:49.464 --> 39:51.063
Stop talking
and put the mask back on.

39:51.064 --> 39:54.263
Make sure she keeps it
on in the ambulance.

39:54.264 --> 39:56.265
Is she going to be OK?

39:56.344 --> 39:58.423
Yes, she should be,
they'll monitor her for 24 hours

39:58.424 --> 40:01.783
and she'll be off work
for a few weeks.

40:01.784 --> 40:04.663
- Were you really in her cupboard?
- Yes.

40:04.664 --> 40:07.863
I just wanted to see
the school was in good hands.

40:07.864 --> 40:09.783
By going in a cupboard?

40:09.784 --> 40:12.023
- This is all my fault, isn't it?
- This?

40:12.024 --> 40:13.943
No, this would have
happened sooner or later.

40:13.944 --> 40:16.823
It's better that it happened sooner,
when there were people around.

40:16.824 --> 40:19.063
But I still don't understand why
you were in a cupboard.

40:19.064 --> 40:21.463
Well, I was just in her office
and then I had her coming...

40:21.464 --> 40:23.863
It just seemed like the best
course of action at the time.

40:23.864 --> 40:25.463
- Oh, I see.
- James!

40:25.464 --> 40:27.555
- James.
- James, hello.

40:27.704 --> 40:29.523
How's your day been?

40:31.064 --> 40:35.223
Here,
so how are we going to do this?

40:35.224 --> 40:38.103
Before we start,
you need to answer a question

40:38.104 --> 40:40.183
and you need to be honest.

40:40.184 --> 40:41.581
OK.

40:42.424 --> 40:45.943
- Did you mean to propose to me?
- Oh, Morwenna.

40:45.944 --> 40:46.944
Yes, or no?

40:47.224 --> 40:48.224
Er...

40:52.024 --> 40:53.024
Erm...

40:53.944 --> 40:56.183
- No.
- Oh.

40:56.184 --> 40:57.623
But I'm glad I did.

40:57.624 --> 41:00.023
It's the best thing I've ever done.

41:00.024 --> 41:02.661
But you didn't mean to do it?

41:03.384 --> 41:04.384
No.

41:05.944 --> 41:08.983
I've... I've wanted to for ages,
but...

41:08.984 --> 41:11.863
Then why are you acting
like you don't want any part of it?

41:11.864 --> 41:16.763
I'm not, Morwenna, am...? Am I?

41:16.984 --> 41:18.743
It's just that, erm...

41:18.744 --> 41:22.583
You know, anything that's ever meant
something to me, you know, I've...

41:22.584 --> 41:23.948
I've ruined it.

41:24.504 --> 41:26.903
You know, once,
I went abroad to find my fortune

41:26.904 --> 41:29.303
and I ended up working
in a bottle factory.

41:29.304 --> 41:33.303
I ran a B&B right into the ground.

41:33.304 --> 41:35.214
And then there's you.

41:35.224 --> 41:37.407
And, you know, you're...

41:37.784 --> 41:40.239
- You're super.
- I'm super.

41:40.504 --> 41:43.323
I'm terrible at this, aren't I?

41:44.824 --> 41:47.703
I just said it and it came out
and you said, "Yes."

41:47.704 --> 41:49.614
And it was brilliant.

41:50.584 --> 41:53.303
But then I was like, "OK,
so when am I going to mess this up?"

41:53.304 --> 41:56.384
No, Al...

41:56.984 --> 41:59.543
A May wedding would be lovely.

41:59.544 --> 42:02.272
You know, we get the sunshine.

42:04.344 --> 42:08.628
I love you, you know that?

42:16.504 --> 42:20.503
All right, you can be quiet
and pretend to die now.

42:20.504 --> 42:22.687
OK, so... so we're good?

42:22.744 --> 42:26.743
Well, you're dying and I am gonna
to save you, so what do you think?

42:26.744 --> 42:28.343
I don't... I don't know.

42:28.344 --> 42:32.435
Right, OK,
so, interlock fingers, knuckles up.

42:32.824 --> 42:36.824
Erm, push down
five or six centimetres.

42:37.624 --> 42:39.383
- Right, one...
- Oh, God!

42:39.384 --> 42:41.303
- ...two...
- Morwenna, that's quite hard!

42:41.304 --> 42:44.023
- Three! Can you be quiet, please?
I'm trying to concentrate. - Sorry.

42:44.024 --> 42:45.783
Keep a steady rhythm.

42:45.784 --> 42:48.023
- One, two...
- Oh!

42:48.024 --> 42:50.263
- Oh, God, Al.
- Ow! Ow!

42:50.264 --> 42:51.901
Al? You all right?

43:00.664 --> 43:04.023
You could have cracked a rib.
There's nothing I can do for you.

43:04.024 --> 43:05.303
If the pain gets unbearable,

43:05.304 --> 43:08.823
Take 400 mg of your favourite
anti-inflammatory twice a day.

43:08.824 --> 43:10.583
I was just doing what it
said in the book.

43:10.584 --> 43:12.343
No, it's probably my fault,
weak ribs.

43:12.344 --> 43:13.890
No, I screwed up.

43:13.944 --> 43:15.703
You have to look
at the collapsed person

43:15.704 --> 43:17.303
and assess
the correct weight to use.

43:17.304 --> 43:19.780
That, and work remember
the rhythm of that song.

43:19.782 --> 43:20.823
What song?

43:20.824 --> 43:24.183
Staying Alive by the Bee Gees.
I didn't know you were a fan, doc.

43:24.184 --> 43:26.423
- I'm not.
- Should I sing it out loud?

43:26.424 --> 43:28.023
No, thank you, not now.

43:28.024 --> 43:30.263
Well, I suppose
we got our wedding song then.

43:30.264 --> 43:31.383
- Oh!
- Sorry.

43:31.384 --> 43:32.384
What song?

43:42.264 --> 43:43.264
How's Al?

43:43.704 --> 43:45.943
Cracked rib.

43:45.944 --> 43:49.463
Oh, I didn't get to ask before,
how did the phlebotomy course go?

43:49.464 --> 43:52.183
Erm, I don't know,
I didn't really finish it.

43:52.184 --> 43:53.184
Why not?

43:53.944 --> 43:55.703
Because you were
hiding in a cupboard.

43:55.704 --> 43:59.223
Oh, sorry about that.

43:59.224 --> 44:04.023
That's all right,
I wasn't really enjoying it.

44:04.024 --> 44:06.743
You know, I've been thinking
about what we discussed,

44:06.744 --> 44:11.017
about now being the best time
to... have a baby.

44:11.384 --> 44:13.476
Well, if we wanted one.

44:13.944 --> 44:16.023
Is this because of
only-child syndrome?

44:16.024 --> 44:19.383
Well, I thought it was,
but the more I thought about it,

44:19.384 --> 44:23.223
I realised,
I just think it's a good idea.

44:23.224 --> 44:25.134
For us and for James.

44:30.904 --> 44:31.904
Excuse me.

44:44.984 --> 44:48.663
So I just wanted to say thank you.

44:48.664 --> 44:50.903
You were right about Miles.

44:50.904 --> 44:55.223
You know, he had that, erm,
Guillain-Barre poly thing.

44:55.224 --> 45:01.303
And they said that if it hadn't been
for you, then he'd have been goner.

45:01.304 --> 45:05.463
- Good.
- Erm, I have some ice cream.

45:05.464 --> 45:06.743
My way of saying thank you.

45:06.744 --> 45:13.188
It's really not necessary,
thank you, good night.

45:28.024 --> 45:29.024
Yes.

45:31.064 --> 45:32.064
Yes?

45:33.944 --> 45:36.183
Another child.

45:36.184 --> 45:39.063
Yes, as in we should
discuss it more, or...?

45:39.064 --> 45:40.701
No, yes as in yes.

45:48.664 --> 45:52.343
May I interest you in signing
Doctor Ellingham's birthday card?

45:52.344 --> 45:55.063
Most of these say,
"Happy birthday, tosser."

45:55.064 --> 45:58.103
- If left untreated, it can be fatal.
- I need to sit down.

45:58.104 --> 45:59.383
You are sitting down.

45:59.384 --> 46:01.385
What's in your pocket?

46:01.944 --> 46:03.063
He's a finch.

46:03.064 --> 46:08.337
- Planning an early night then?
- No, you're not ovulating.
