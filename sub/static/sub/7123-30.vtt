00:38.104 --> 00:38.934
Huh.

00:39.005 --> 00:40.404
Is this like eating for you?

00:40.473 --> 00:42.907
I don't know about eating,
but it feels nice.

00:42.976 --> 00:44.136
Hmm.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.139
Mm.

00:48.214 --> 00:49.044
Hey.

00:49.115 --> 00:50.776
You two should get a room.

00:52.352 --> 00:55.549
You and that <i>log,</i>
not you and Finn.

00:55.622 --> 00:57.954
'Cause you're hugging
a log, you weirdo.

00:59.559 --> 01:02.323
Grrrr!

01:02.395 --> 01:03.225
Finn.

01:03.296 --> 01:04.126
Huh?

01:04.197 --> 01:06.290
Let me.

01:06.366 --> 01:07.458
Huh?!

01:08.501 --> 01:10.162
Huh?

01:10.236 --> 01:12.796
Hey, now. Stay away from me.

01:12.872 --> 01:14.601
Shoo! Shoo! Oh!

01:17.110 --> 01:19.442
Oh, so you want to
get real, do you?

01:19.512 --> 01:20.911
Well, check this.

01:20.980 --> 01:21.810
You seeing this?

01:21.881 --> 01:22.711
Huh?

01:22.782 --> 01:24.181
Oh!

01:25.518 --> 01:26.712
Whoa.

01:26.786 --> 01:28.014
Aah! Oh! Ugh!

01:28.088 --> 01:30.283
Why don't <i>you</i> get a room?

01:30.356 --> 01:31.356
Oof!

01:35.895 --> 01:37.556
Aah! My hams!

01:37.630 --> 01:38.858
Beat it, you freaky old trump!

01:57.517 --> 01:58.916
Huh?

01:58.985 --> 02:00.646
What's cooking? Smells good.

02:00.720 --> 02:01.880
Wha?

02:01.955 --> 02:03.081
Whaaah!

02:03.156 --> 02:03.986
Oh! Aah! Aah! Aah!

02:04.057 --> 02:04.887
Breath mint!

02:04.958 --> 02:06.220
Aah! Aaaah!

02:06.292 --> 02:07.292
Huh?

02:07.327 --> 02:08.520
Gah!

02:10.229 --> 02:12.027
My body is engulfed in flames!

02:14.634 --> 02:17.660
Oh, so good!

02:17.737 --> 02:18.897
- Hey!
- What?

02:18.972 --> 02:19.904
Blew it. Blew it.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.099
Huh?

02:21.174 --> 02:23.165
- You blew it. Eh-eh-eh-eh-eggs!

02:23.243 --> 02:24.073
Wha!

02:24.144 --> 02:25.236
Ninja kick!

02:25.311 --> 02:27.541
Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh eh-eh-eggs!

02:27.614 --> 02:28.842
File folder!

02:28.915 --> 02:30.974
Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eggs!

02:31.050 --> 02:32.608
Gorilla!

02:32.685 --> 02:34.676
Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eggs.

02:34.754 --> 02:35.948
Jake. Jake.

02:36.022 --> 02:38.081
I had an awesome dream.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.318
Flame Princess was there.

02:39.392 --> 02:40.791
My body was on fire.

02:40.860 --> 02:42.691
I think it was inspired
by Flame Princess

02:42.762 --> 02:44.161
battling Ice King yesterday.

02:44.230 --> 02:45.230
Hmm. That's weird.

02:45.298 --> 02:46.298
I had a dream, too.

02:46.366 --> 02:47.799
I'll tell you about it.

02:47.867 --> 02:50.358
So, then paintings were found,
and everyone's eyes lit up.

02:50.436 --> 02:53.667
Cinnamon Bun smiled and said,
"I saw it from miles away."

02:53.740 --> 02:56.334
<i>Man, I need to have
that dream again.</i>

02:56.409 --> 03:00.106
<i>I have to get Flame Princess
to beat down Ice King again.</i>

03:02.382 --> 03:04.077
Why'd you pick <i>this</i> spot?

03:04.150 --> 03:06.482
Why does anyone do anything?

03:06.553 --> 03:07.451
Hmm.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.181
Why do they?

03:10.290 --> 03:11.120
Mm?

03:11.191 --> 03:13.125
No, thanks.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.252
Suit yourself.

03:16.229 --> 03:17.229
Mm?

03:21.167 --> 03:22.225
Hey! I-l-look!

03:23.203 --> 03:24.431
Hey, look.

03:24.504 --> 03:26.424
There's that big jerk you
hate so much, remember?

03:27.273 --> 03:28.968
Hmm? Oh, hey, kids.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.839
Fine day for a picnic.

03:30.910 --> 03:32.138
Oh, dang.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.212
Did you hear that?

03:34.380 --> 03:36.245
I think he's, like,
making fun of you.

03:36.316 --> 03:37.248
What?

03:37.317 --> 03:38.249
Yeah.

03:38.318 --> 03:40.479
It's in the tone of his voice.

03:40.553 --> 03:42.544
What did you say to me?

03:42.622 --> 03:44.021
Uh, uh... w-what?

03:44.090 --> 03:45.090
W-what did I say?

03:46.192 --> 03:47.921
It <i>is</i> in the tone of your voice.

03:47.994 --> 03:48.926
L-look.

03:48.995 --> 03:49.927
Just take whatever
you want, okay?

03:49.996 --> 03:51.122
Take it all.

03:51.197 --> 03:52.841
It's all just prunes...
prunes and liver...

03:52.865 --> 03:53.865
Frozen, of course.

03:54.801 --> 03:55.801
Ugh!

04:02.575 --> 04:03.769
Bah!

04:03.843 --> 04:06.971
You might have what it takes
to slap these old jowls,

04:07.046 --> 04:10.209
but do you have what
it takes to face my...

04:10.283 --> 04:11.375
just a sec.

04:11.451 --> 04:14.784
Legion of Snow Warriors?!

04:14.854 --> 04:17.152
Go, fight! Protect me!

04:20.125 --> 04:22.117
Oh, boy.

04:22.195 --> 04:25.062
I don't like being
made fun of, Ice King.

04:25.131 --> 04:27.031
I don't like it at all!

04:27.100 --> 04:28.100
Whoa!

04:33.006 --> 04:34.564
Oh!

04:38.077 --> 04:38.907
Oh, man.

04:38.978 --> 04:41.003
Times! I call times!

04:42.815 --> 04:45.283
It's only okay if the person
who's making the fun is someone

04:45.351 --> 04:46.716
that I'm cool with.

04:46.786 --> 04:47.810
We're totes cool.

04:47.887 --> 04:49.149
I-I-I'm Ice King.

04:49.222 --> 04:53.318
And they do it in a
respectful and knowing way.

04:53.393 --> 04:54.223
Respect?

04:54.294 --> 04:55.226
I got all kinds of respect.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.455
Oh, yeah?

04:56.529 --> 04:58.292
Then what's with that
stupid, smirky face?

04:58.364 --> 04:59.364
Smirk?

04:59.432 --> 05:01.627
Oh, I-I smirk when I'm nervous.

05:01.701 --> 05:03.100
Ugh, bear hug!

05:03.169 --> 05:04.227
Whaaah!

05:05.371 --> 05:07.737
And also when I'm about to win!

05:08.708 --> 05:10.175
Boo-yah!

05:10.243 --> 05:13.644
And I didn't even get to test
out my new fireproof grundies.

05:13.713 --> 05:14.805
Put it away, man.

05:14.881 --> 05:15.973
You didn't win nothing.

05:18.751 --> 05:19.945
Are you okay?

05:20.019 --> 05:21.987
You feel lukewarm.

05:22.055 --> 05:24.421
I-I just need to burn a
couple of forests or

05:24.490 --> 05:27.050
something and get a
good night's sleep.

05:27.126 --> 05:29.321
Yeah... sleep.

05:34.634 --> 05:35.634
Milk.

05:39.872 --> 05:40.872
Milk.

05:44.944 --> 05:46.741
Play the sleep jam, BMO.

05:51.584 --> 05:52.983
Mm.

05:53.052 --> 05:54.713
What's cooking? Smells good.

05:54.787 --> 05:56.345
Wha?

05:56.422 --> 05:57.980
Hi-yah!

05:58.057 --> 06:00.116
What? Oh, no!

06:05.898 --> 06:08.230
Aah! Aah!

06:09.335 --> 06:10.427
Huh?

06:14.073 --> 06:15.370
Jake! I had another dream!

06:15.441 --> 06:16.481
My body was being blasted.

06:17.844 --> 06:20.074
But this time, Ice King was
blasting me with ice cubes.

06:20.146 --> 06:22.080
Oh! It was awful!

06:22.148 --> 06:23.843
And someone else was there.

06:23.916 --> 06:25.884
He was just laughing
and laughing.

06:25.952 --> 06:28.386
He was in the first dream,
too, but he was whispering.

06:28.454 --> 06:29.932
I couldn't make out
what he was saying.

06:29.956 --> 06:30.956
Oh, yeah.

06:30.990 --> 06:32.048
It was the Cosmic Owl.

06:32.125 --> 06:33.615
Pbht!

06:33.693 --> 06:36.457
What?! You didn't tell me
the Cosmic Owl was there!

06:36.529 --> 06:37.996
I couldn't see him last time.

06:38.064 --> 06:40.191
Dude, that means it was
a prophetic dream.

06:40.266 --> 06:41.858
You have to finish
the original dream.

06:41.934 --> 06:44.835
Cosmic Owl could be whispering
something wildly significant!

06:44.904 --> 06:47.464
You have to get Flame Princess
and Ice King to fight again

06:47.540 --> 06:48.973
so you can see the
end of the dream.

06:49.041 --> 06:50.041
Make them fight!

06:50.076 --> 06:51.202
Aah! Do it now!

06:51.277 --> 06:52.801
Aaaah!

06:52.879 --> 06:54.279
Dear Ice King, you
smell like stink.

06:54.347 --> 06:55.279
You're unpleasant, you're
not funny, you're old...

06:55.348 --> 06:56.280
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

06:56.349 --> 06:57.359
Sincerely, love, Flame Princess.

06:57.383 --> 06:58.816
P.S. Let us fight.

06:58.885 --> 07:00.284
Aaaah!

07:00.353 --> 07:01.764
Dear Flame Princess,
you're just the worst.

07:01.788 --> 07:02.865
Your hair is bad, your feet
smell like face cheeks...

07:02.889 --> 07:03.787
blah, blah, blah, blah.

07:03.856 --> 07:04.686
Let us meet up and fight, dummy.

07:04.757 --> 07:06.918
Sincerely, Ice King.

07:06.993 --> 07:07.891
Hmm.

07:07.960 --> 07:09.160
Flame Princess fight Ice King.

07:10.062 --> 07:10.960
Ice King.

07:11.030 --> 07:12.691
What?

07:12.765 --> 07:14.665
Ooh! Beard mail!

07:14.734 --> 07:17.032
"Dear Ice King,
you're not funny,

07:17.103 --> 07:19.799
you're old, and no Princess
will ever marry you ever,

07:19.872 --> 07:21.100
Simple Simon."

07:21.174 --> 07:23.836
Oh, fight.

07:23.910 --> 07:24.842
Flame Princess!

07:24.911 --> 07:26.208
Huh?

07:26.279 --> 07:29.248
"Dear Flame Princess, your
feet smell like face cheeks,

07:29.315 --> 07:31.442
your stupid candles
smell heinous,

07:31.517 --> 07:35.044
and you can't even kiss Finn
without totes freakin' out!"

07:35.121 --> 07:36.121
Aaah!

07:49.936 --> 07:50.766
Not my beard.

07:50.837 --> 07:51.667
Ohh!

07:51.737 --> 07:52.567
Pbht!

07:52.638 --> 07:53.468
Ow!

07:53.539 --> 07:54.539
Aaah!

08:01.981 --> 08:03.414
What is all that noise?

08:03.483 --> 08:05.144
Ach, mein gloob!

08:05.218 --> 08:08.984
Infern-o-o-o-o-o-o shot!

08:09.055 --> 08:10.317
I-I-I-Ice...

08:10.389 --> 08:11.913
uh, King!

08:16.762 --> 08:18.923
Aah! Whoa! Ow!

08:33.913 --> 08:35.107
Ergh! Stop that!

08:36.215 --> 08:38.342
Hows about some of this?!

08:38.417 --> 08:39.884
Yee... aah!

08:43.155 --> 08:44.395
Oh, beans! Oh, beans! Oh, beans!

08:46.626 --> 08:48.958
I maybe went too far
with this jazz.

08:51.297 --> 08:52.457
Flame Princess.

08:54.166 --> 08:55.463
Too hot.

09:05.811 --> 09:09.212
Aah!

09:10.249 --> 09:11.079
Mm.

09:11.150 --> 09:12.150
Huh?

09:13.319 --> 09:14.319
Uh.

09:17.189 --> 09:18.315
Wha. Wha-wha wha-wha?

09:19.292 --> 09:20.384
Wha-wha?

09:20.459 --> 09:22.620
Wha wh-wh-wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-
wha-wha-wha?

09:22.695 --> 09:24.492
Wha wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-wha?

09:24.564 --> 09:27.226
Wha wha-wha-wha-wha-
wha-wha-wha-wha-wha!

09:27.300 --> 09:28.232
You blew it.

09:28.301 --> 09:29.325
Huh?

09:33.005 --> 09:35.667
Okay. I can fix this.

09:35.741 --> 09:36.969
I can make it right.

09:38.578 --> 09:39.704
Ice King!

09:39.779 --> 09:40.609
Finn.

09:40.680 --> 09:41.908
I'm so sorry, man.

09:41.981 --> 09:43.812
Help, Gunter. Please.

09:44.850 --> 09:47.114
I-I meant after you save me.

09:51.791 --> 09:52.621
Wenk!

09:52.692 --> 09:53.522
Oh.

09:53.593 --> 09:54.617
Wenk, wenk.

09:54.694 --> 09:56.161
Come on.

09:56.228 --> 09:57.228
Let's get out of here.

09:57.263 --> 09:59.288
Oh! That's right.

09:59.365 --> 10:01.094
Carry me like a Princess.

10:01.167 --> 10:02.464
Wenk, wenk.

10:02.535 --> 10:03.365
Eh?

10:03.436 --> 10:06.701
Ice King!

10:06.772 --> 10:09.400
You can't escape me!

10:09.475 --> 10:10.475
Wha?

10:11.377 --> 10:12.401
Finn.

10:12.478 --> 10:13.478
Aaah!

10:13.546 --> 10:15.844
Ice, uh, whatever.

10:15.915 --> 10:17.940
I'm so, so sorry, Finn.

10:18.017 --> 10:18.881
Are you all right?

10:18.951 --> 10:19.951
No, Princess.

10:20.853 --> 10:22.047
<i>I'm</i> the one who's sorry.

10:22.121 --> 10:23.632
Ice King hasn't been
picking fights with you.

10:23.656 --> 10:25.419
It's... it's been me all along.

10:25.491 --> 10:26.583
What?

10:26.659 --> 10:28.456
So, <i>you</i> wrote that letter?

10:28.527 --> 10:29.789
Yes.

10:29.862 --> 10:32.296
But, look, it's just like...
I had this dream and...

10:32.365 --> 10:34.333
and it was because of
that fight you had.

10:34.400 --> 10:37.062
It was weird, but I also
liked it, but it...

10:37.136 --> 10:39.832
but it was important because the
Cosmic Owl was wh-wh-wha-wha.

10:39.905 --> 10:41.167
Whadda-wha-wha-wha.

10:41.240 --> 10:42.730
Wha-wha-wha, wha-wha-wha-wha.

10:42.808 --> 10:43.934
Wh-wha.

10:44.010 --> 10:45.170
Wh-wh-wh-wha.

10:45.244 --> 10:46.855
And so I had to get you
to beat up Ice King be...

10:46.879 --> 10:47.811
Shh!

10:47.880 --> 10:49.211
I should have known.

10:49.281 --> 10:51.772
That letter said things in
it that only you would know,

10:51.851 --> 10:55.719
personal things, Finn, and
you used them against me.

10:55.788 --> 10:58.757
I thought <i>you</i> were the
one person I could...

10:58.824 --> 11:00.985
I-I need some time alone.

11:01.060 --> 11:02.584
Princess.

11:05.097 --> 11:06.564
But...

11:06.632 --> 11:08.429
I-I-I said I was sorry.

11:11.971 --> 11:13.199
You blew it, man.
