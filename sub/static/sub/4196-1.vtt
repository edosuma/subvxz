01:31.320 --> 01:37.080
<i>The strange, almost unbelievable,
story of Robert Scott Carey</i>

01:37.280 --> 01:40.080
<i>began on a very ordinary summer day.</i>

01:40.280 --> 01:45.200
<i>I know this story better than anyone
because I am Robert Scott Carey.</i>

01:55.480 --> 02:00.360
- This is the way to spend a vacation.
- Mm-hmm.

02:00.560 --> 02:02.800
I'm thirsty.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.560
Mmm! That sun feels good.

02:05.760 --> 02:08.400
- I'm thirsty.
- Interesting.

02:08.600 --> 02:11.560
- A cold bottle of beer'd taste fine.
- Why don't you get it?

02:11.760 --> 02:13.040
- Me?
- Mm-hm.

02:13.240 --> 02:17.360
- I'm on vacation. All week.
- Well, so am I, my friend.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.240
- Louise?
- Hmm?

02:26.440 --> 02:29.600
- I think we should get married.
- We've been married six years.

02:29.800 --> 02:31.000
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

02:31.200 --> 02:33.200
Seems like six minutes.

02:33.400 --> 02:36.240
I am not gonna get you that beer.

02:37.280 --> 02:39.360
I provided the boat.
You provide the beer.

02:39.560 --> 02:42.440
- Your brother provided the boat.
- I'll make you a deal.

02:42.640 --> 02:45.960
- What?
- You get the beer, I'll get the dinner.

02:46.160 --> 02:49.840
- How's that?
- OK, you got yourself a deal.

02:50.040 --> 02:52.520
To the galley, wench.
Fetch me a flagon of beer.

02:52.720 --> 02:56.160
I'm sorry, Captain, but we're
out of flagons. It'll have to be a can.

02:56.360 --> 02:59.480
Out of flagons?
How are we to make the Philippines?

02:59.680 --> 03:02.840
We're not going, sir.
We're going home at the end of the week.

03:03.040 --> 03:05.000
Mutiny.

03:06.720 --> 03:10.320
- Make 'em cold!
- Like ice.

04:00.880 --> 04:04.800
- Scott, what was that?
- I don't know. Some kind of mist.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.960
Look at your chest.

04:17.320 --> 04:22.200
<i>But then, on an equally ordinary day,
six months later.</i>

04:24.640 --> 04:26.720
- Morning, Joe.
- Morning, Mrs Carey.

04:26.920 --> 04:30.680
- Looks like a nice day, huh?
- See you tomorrow.

04:34.200 --> 04:37.920
Here, kitty-kitty-kitty.
Here, kitty-kitty-kitty. Come on, Butch.

04:38.120 --> 04:41.760
That's a boy. There you go.

05:03.800 --> 05:07.720
- Scott? Scott, are you dressed yet?
- I'll be right there.

05:07.920 --> 05:09.920
All right.

05:14.440 --> 05:16.280
- Lou?
- Yes, dear?

05:16.480 --> 05:18.960
You sure you got the right
pants from the cleaners?

05:19.160 --> 05:21.280
Just a second.

05:27.720 --> 05:30.880
- You asked that yesterday morning.
- They still don't fit.

05:31.080 --> 05:33.520
- They still too loose?
- The cuffs are draggin'.

05:33.720 --> 05:35.400
They do look kinda big.

05:35.600 --> 05:38.600
I dunno what that cleaner's doing,
but tell him to cut it out.

05:38.800 --> 05:42.240
You're just losing weight.
It's very becoming, so don't complain.

05:42.440 --> 05:44.600
- You want one or two eggs?
- One.

05:44.800 --> 05:47.880
One?
Now that's why your pants don't fit.

06:06.200 --> 06:09.240
- Lou?
- Yeah?

06:10.200 --> 06:12.000
Hey, the shirt doesn't fit either.

06:12.200 --> 06:14.520
It's your shirt.
It's got your monogram on it.

06:14.720 --> 06:18.480
- What's that supposed...
- Eat your breakfast and forget it.

06:18.680 --> 06:22.360
I know a lot of people who'd like to
lose weight. What's your secret?

06:22.560 --> 06:28.440
- Maybe it's the cooking around here.
- Well, thanks a lot. Drink yourjuice.

06:28.640 --> 06:30.480
- Lou, do me a favour.
- What, honey?

06:30.680 --> 06:34.840
- Pick up a bathroom scale today.
- All right.

06:45.040 --> 06:47.280
Still get five foot eleven inches,
Mr Carey.

06:47.480 --> 06:50.320
- I've been six foot one since I was 17.
- Mm-hm.

06:50.520 --> 06:54.640
- What's the weight?
- Still 174 and a quarter pounds.

06:54.840 --> 06:59.360
I don't understand it.
That's a loss of almost ten pounds.

06:59.560 --> 07:02.280
I told you,
you're probably overworking yourself.

07:02.480 --> 07:05.760
You told me that when you overwork
you get nervous and lose weight.

07:05.960 --> 07:08.000
But I've never lost that much weight.

07:08.200 --> 07:10.920
Besides, I haven't been
particularly nervous lately.

07:11.120 --> 07:13.840
Not eating wouldn't
make me lose height, would it?

07:14.040 --> 07:17.000
Oh, I very much doubt if you've
been losing height, Mr Carey.

07:17.200 --> 07:19.400
Why don't you put your things on?

07:19.600 --> 07:23.480
You told me that you've been six
foot one since you were 17 years old.

07:23.680 --> 07:25.000
That's right.

07:25.200 --> 07:28.560
How many physical examinations
have you had since then?

07:28.760 --> 07:32.200
Oh, the draft board, the Navy,
a life insurance physical.

07:32.400 --> 07:35.200
That's not too many.
It's possible there might have been

07:35.400 --> 07:37.880
errors made on all of them
as regards your height.

07:38.080 --> 07:41.200
It often happens. A number of things
could cause such errors.

07:41.400 --> 07:45.920
If you stood erect, you'd measure out
as taller than you actually are.

07:46.120 --> 07:49.680
Or if your height was taken in the
morning, you'd measure out as taller.

07:49.880 --> 07:51.080
Why's that?

07:51.280 --> 07:54.040
Because people decrease in height
during the day.

07:54.240 --> 07:59.040
See, the body weight compresses the
spinal discs, the bone joints and so on.

07:59.240 --> 08:04.760
- I see. Two inches, Doctor?
- I wouldn't worry about it, Mr Carey.

08:04.960 --> 08:07.360
As far as I can see
you're in perfect health.

08:07.560 --> 08:11.160
Likely lost a little weight
due to an insufficient diet but...

08:11.360 --> 08:16.920
People don't get shorter, Mr Carey.
They just don't get shorter.

08:27.960 --> 08:30.320
What'd Charlie think about
your idea for the ad?

08:30.520 --> 08:34.679
Huh? Oh, he thinks it has possibilities.

08:40.640 --> 08:43.159
- Well?
- Four pounds.

08:43.360 --> 08:45.040
- Up or down?
- Down.

08:45.240 --> 08:48.400
That does it, my boy.
You're gonna start taking vitamins.

08:48.600 --> 08:51.040
I'm gonna get you so fat
on ice cream and cake

08:51.240 --> 08:53.840
you'll think you're
living in a child's paradise.

08:54.040 --> 08:57.240
- I don't think that's gonna fix it.
- Then we'll see a doctor.

08:57.440 --> 09:01.560
- You're due for a checkup anyway.
- I've already seen a doctor.

09:01.760 --> 09:03.840
- When?
- A week ago.

09:04.040 --> 09:06.960
Well, honey,
why didn't you say something about it?

09:08.800 --> 09:10.760
Come here, Louise.

09:12.520 --> 09:16.520
- Kiss me.
- You think that's gonna fix it, huh?

09:21.080 --> 09:24.560
You didn't have to stretch.
You used to stand on your toes.

09:24.760 --> 09:26.520
What? In your stocking feet?

09:30.640 --> 09:34.440
- I'm getting smaller, Lou. Every day.
- Well, that's silly, honey.

09:34.640 --> 09:36.480
People just don't get smaller.

09:38.200 --> 09:40.160
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

09:40.360 --> 09:43.880
We'll go back to the doctor tomorrow.
I'm sure he's got a pill for it.

09:55.600 --> 10:00.760
Don't worry, Butch. Everything's
gonna be all right. Go to bed.

10:38.560 --> 10:40.640
Well, that's the last of them, Mr Carey.

10:40.840 --> 10:45.280
- This has been a long week, Dr Bramson.
- I must have worn out your machine.

10:45.480 --> 10:48.600
I needed two full sets of pictures
spaced several days apart.

10:48.800 --> 10:53.280
I had to compare them before I...
Before I could be sure.

10:53.480 --> 10:55.520
Sure of what, Doctor? What is it?

10:55.720 --> 11:00.040
Relax, Doctor, you can't tell me
anything I haven't imagined.

11:02.600 --> 11:05.600
You are getting smaller.

11:05.800 --> 11:09.600
I... I don't profess to understand it,
Mr Carey.

11:09.800 --> 11:13.400
There's no medical precedent
for what's happening to you.

11:13.600 --> 11:16.280
I simply know that
you're getting smaller.

11:16.480 --> 11:20.080
The X-rays prove it beyond any doubt.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.440
But that's impossible.

11:22.640 --> 11:26.440
That's what we've always believed,
Mrs Carey.

11:29.040 --> 11:32.800
I'm gonna send you to the
California Medical Research Institute.

11:33.000 --> 11:37.040
If there is an explanation
for your phenomenon, why...

11:37.240 --> 11:39.800
They'll find it.

11:50.240 --> 11:53.160
<i>Then began a series of intensive tests.</i>

11:53.360 --> 11:58.800
<i>I drank a barium solution,
and stood behind a fluoroscope screen.</i>

11:59.000 --> 12:01.520
<i>They gave me radioactive iodine.</i>

12:05.120 --> 12:08.040
<i>And an examination
with a Geiger counter.</i>

12:09.520 --> 12:12.360
<i>I had electrodes fastened to my head.</i>

12:12.560 --> 12:17.120
<i>Water restriction tests, protein bond
tests, eye tests, blood cultures,</i>

12:17.320 --> 12:21.120
<i>X-rays and more X-rays.
Tests, endless tests.</i>

12:21.320 --> 12:25.760
<i>And then one day in the third week
the final examination.</i>

12:25.960 --> 12:28.680
<i>A paper chromatography test.</i>

12:30.040 --> 12:32.080
Now don't be despondent, Mr Carey.

12:32.280 --> 12:35.040
At least we've found out
what is happening to you.

12:35.240 --> 12:38.360
Gradual loss of nitrogen,
calcium, phosphorus.

12:38.560 --> 12:41.840
- This test may tell us why.
- I hope so.

12:42.040 --> 12:46.520
I think the strip should be dry by now.
We should find phospholipid,

12:46.720 --> 12:51.840
amino acids, cholesterol,
creatinine, and protein.

12:52.040 --> 12:56.240
These are the elements
most commonly found on the strip.

12:56.440 --> 12:59.080
Mm-hm.

12:59.280 --> 13:04.560
Wait a minute. This one doesn't belong.

13:10.920 --> 13:14.600
It certainly doesn't belong.
Here, take a look.

13:17.240 --> 13:19.600
Our analysis shows that
it's a rearrangement

13:19.800 --> 13:22.560
of the molecular structure
of the cells in your body.

13:22.760 --> 13:26.440
- You mean like a cancer?
- No.

13:26.640 --> 13:30.800
No, more like an anti-cancer,
causing a diminution of all the organs.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.320
Then you know what's
causing me to get smaller.

13:33.520 --> 13:36.480
We think we do, Mr Carey.
That's why I asked you here.

13:36.680 --> 13:39.720
Now I want you to tell me something.

13:39.920 --> 13:43.560
Have you ever been accidentally exposed
to any kind of germ spray?

13:43.760 --> 13:46.640
In particular, an insecticide,
a great deal of it.

13:46.840 --> 13:50.240
- Insecticide?
- Exactly.

13:50.440 --> 13:53.560
Has there ever been a time
when you were so exposed?

13:53.760 --> 13:56.440
Do you remember that day
I told you about the truck?

13:56.640 --> 13:58.920
Yes, about two months ago.

13:59.120 --> 14:01.400
I was on my way to the store
through an alley.

14:01.600 --> 14:05.440
As I was walking a truck turned in.
It was spraying trees.

14:05.640 --> 14:09.280
- Is that what's causing me to...
- No, that was only the beginning.

14:09.480 --> 14:13.760
You see, something happened to that
insecticide after it was in your system.

14:13.960 --> 14:16.520
Something fantastic and unprecedented.

14:16.720 --> 14:18.760
Something which, in Layman's terms,

14:18.960 --> 14:22.400
so affected the insecticide
that from a mildly virulent germ spray

14:22.600 --> 14:26.160
it created deadly chemical
reversal of the growth process.

14:26.360 --> 14:29.720
Have you been exposed to any
radioactivity in the past six months?

14:29.920 --> 14:33.640
Oh, no, of course not. I don't come in
contact with anything like that. I...

14:33.840 --> 14:37.560
Scott, wait a minute.
That day we were on the boat.

14:37.760 --> 14:40.320
- The boat?
- Charlie's boat. Remember?

14:40.520 --> 14:42.360
Well, yes, I remember.

14:43.880 --> 14:45.840
The mist.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.960
That mist!

14:58.680 --> 15:02.000
You want me to drive, honey?

15:02.200 --> 15:04.600
No, I'm all right.

15:04.800 --> 15:06.600
Louise...

15:07.640 --> 15:12.320
I want you to start thinking about us.
Our marriage.

15:12.520 --> 15:16.440
Some awful things might happen.
There's a limit to your obligation.

15:16.640 --> 15:19.040
Oh now, wait a minute.

15:19.240 --> 15:22.880
Look, I love you. Don't you know that?

15:23.080 --> 15:26.880
You love Scott Carey. He has a size
and a shape and a way of thinking.

15:27.080 --> 15:31.360
- All that's changing now.
- Not a darn thing's changed.

15:31.560 --> 15:34.200
When I married you I meant what I said.

15:34.400 --> 15:39.120
And as long as you've got
this wedding ring on, you've got me.

15:39.320 --> 15:41.880
Come on now, let's go home.

15:58.680 --> 16:01.160
The truth is,
I just lost the Bannister account.

16:01.360 --> 16:05.440
You know how big that account was.
Probably 40 per cent of my income.

16:05.640 --> 16:09.640
It's gone now and I just can't afford to
send you your pay cheques any more.

16:09.840 --> 16:12.680
You've done everything
that a brother possibly could do.

16:12.880 --> 16:14.760
Look, I don't like to say this but...

16:14.960 --> 16:17.200
There have been reporters
over at the plant.

16:17.400 --> 16:20.360
Looks like somebody at the
medical centre talked about you.

16:20.560 --> 16:24.320
I told them there was nothing in it,
but one of the reporters stayed behind.

16:24.520 --> 16:26.600
He was from the
American Press Syndicate.

16:26.800 --> 16:30.600
He said they might pay for the story.
If it's true.

16:30.800 --> 16:33.480
Scott, the story's going to
break anyway eventually.

16:33.680 --> 16:37.240
So whether you make them pay or not,
they're going to make the most of it.

16:37.440 --> 16:41.520
- So make them pay.
- No, Charlie.

16:41.720 --> 16:44.000
Well, think about it.

16:47.040 --> 16:50.400
All right. I'll think about it.

16:54.520 --> 16:57.320
<i>But really, was there any choice?</i>

16:57.520 --> 17:01.080
<i>We owed a great deal of money
and I had no job.</i>

17:01.280 --> 17:04.240
<i>There was no choice. None at all.</i>

17:04.440 --> 17:07.520
<i>And so I became famous.</i>

17:07.720 --> 17:10.040
<i>And still Robert Scott Carey,</i>

17:10.240 --> 17:14.520
<i>known to a nation as The Incredible
Shrinking Man, keeps getting smaller.</i>

17:14.720 --> 17:17.359
<i>How long will this phenomenon continue?</i>

17:17.560 --> 17:20.520
I want to apply for
an unlisted line please.

17:20.720 --> 17:23.760
This is a special case.

17:23.960 --> 17:27.000
My name is Louise Carey, my hus...

17:27.200 --> 17:30.760
Carey. C-A-R-E-Y.

17:30.960 --> 17:35.520
Now look, we've got to have an unlisted
line. That's all there is to it.

17:36.920 --> 17:38.520
I... I talked to you yesterday.

17:38.720 --> 17:41.960
- Has he come out yet?
- How big is he now?

17:42.160 --> 17:47.000
- Have you seen him?
- He's got to come out sometime.

17:47.200 --> 17:50.000
What's the television truck doing here?

17:50.200 --> 17:52.600
<i>We return you now to Magic Melody.</i>

18:02.600 --> 18:04.880
Yes, thank you very much.

18:12.840 --> 18:18.160
Scott? Scott, I've...

18:18.360 --> 18:22.040
- I've cancelled our phone.
- What?

18:22.240 --> 18:23.960
I said, I've cancelled our phone.

18:24.160 --> 18:27.480
They're gonna try to get us
an unlisted line sometime next week.

18:27.680 --> 18:30.760
- What do you mean, they're gonna try?
- They're just gonna try.

18:30.960 --> 18:33.280
A lot of people are
waiting for unlisted lines.

18:33.480 --> 18:37.560
Didn't you tell them who you're married
to? Scott Carey, the shrinking freak?

18:37.760 --> 18:39.640
- Don't.
- Use your influence.

18:39.840 --> 18:42.880
- I'm a big man! I'm famous!
- Please don't.

18:43.080 --> 18:46.400
Those reporters out there.
Why don't you tell them about it?

18:46.600 --> 18:49.560
Give 'em a new angle for their...
for their papers!

18:49.760 --> 18:53.640
Or will I save it for my book?
Yeah, that's what I'll do.

18:53.840 --> 18:56.120
A whole chapter devoted to telephones

18:56.320 --> 18:59.640
and one more joke
for the world to laugh at!

18:59.840 --> 19:03.240
Scott, people know. They realise.
They're not laughing at you.

19:03.440 --> 19:04.840
- They're not?
- No.

19:05.040 --> 19:07.000
Why not? It's funny, isn't it?

19:07.200 --> 19:12.240
But it is. See how funny I am?
The child that looks like a man.

19:12.440 --> 19:16.040
Go on, laugh, Louise.
Be like everyone else. It's all right.

19:16.240 --> 19:20.880
Well, why can't you look at me?
Look at me!

19:21.080 --> 19:25.480
Don't, Scott.

19:34.760 --> 19:38.160
Will they just let us alone?

19:38.360 --> 19:40.880
Will they just let us alone?

19:41.080 --> 19:46.440
Lou, honey, I'm sorry. I must be losing
my mind, talking to you like this.

19:46.640 --> 19:50.080
No, honey. I'm all right.

19:50.280 --> 19:53.720
- I know what you must be suffering.
- Do you?

19:56.080 --> 19:59.800
Yes, I guess it's been
a nightmare for you too.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.440
Maybe we've forgotten how to hope.

20:02.640 --> 20:05.360
But, Scott, there's so much to hope for.

20:05.560 --> 20:09.000
Any day now the doctors
say they may find the antitoxin.

20:09.200 --> 20:14.720
Sure. Lou, let's get out of this place
before we both go crazy.

20:14.920 --> 20:16.960
Somewhere where nobody can find us.

20:17.160 --> 20:21.440
All right, Scott. I'll...
I'll look for something.

20:21.640 --> 20:25.360
And try... Try not to worry.

20:25.560 --> 20:31.000
No, I'll let the doctors worry.
I'm two days behind on my book.

20:37.680 --> 20:41.400
<i>October 17th.
Height: 36-and-a-half inches.</i>

20:41.600 --> 20:43.600
<i>Weight: 52 pounds.</i>

20:43.800 --> 20:47.440
<i>We haven't been able to find a new house
and there still is no privacy,</i>

20:47.640 --> 20:50.400
<i>no relief,
and no word from the medical centre.</i>

20:50.600 --> 20:54.000
<i>- I fear that what life remains to me...</i>

21:00.480 --> 21:04.000
Hello? Yes, this is Carey.

21:08.400 --> 21:11.200
- Louise!
- Yes, Scott?

21:11.400 --> 21:13.560
The antitoxin, they found it.

21:13.760 --> 21:17.800
Oh, Scott. Are you sure?

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
Dr Silver wants us down there.
Right away!

21:27.280 --> 21:29.640
There's something you both
must understand.

21:29.840 --> 21:33.640
We're working with unknown factors.
Nothing is guaranteed.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.240
We're 50 per cent sure
this will be effective.

21:37.440 --> 21:40.520
The other 50 per cent,
we'll just have to pray.

21:40.720 --> 21:42.480
How long before we'll know?

21:42.680 --> 21:45.480
Mr Carey will remain here
under observation for a week.

21:45.680 --> 21:47.640
We should have the answer by then.

21:47.840 --> 21:50.320
- Are you ready?
- Ready.

21:59.440 --> 22:02.240
Weight: 52 pounds.

22:02.440 --> 22:05.520
Height: 36-and-a-half inches.

22:05.720 --> 22:08.080
What was last week's reading?

22:08.280 --> 22:13.640
Weight: 52 pounds. Height:
36-and-a-half inches. No change, Doctor.

22:13.840 --> 22:16.520
It's all over, Scott.
You're gonna be all right.

22:16.720 --> 22:20.920
How long will it take, Dr Silver?
To be normal again?

22:21.120 --> 22:25.440
Put on your robe now.
That'll be all, Miss Maltby.

22:25.640 --> 22:29.520
Mr Carey, we seem to have checked the
degenerative process of your disease.

22:29.720 --> 22:31.720
We've won that much.

22:31.920 --> 22:35.680
At this moment the growth capacity of
your body is as limited as any adult's.

22:35.880 --> 22:38.960
Whether or not you grow again
is another question.

22:39.160 --> 22:42.160
To help you,
we face a whole new set of problems.

22:42.360 --> 22:46.240
Then I'll spend the rest of my life...
like this?

22:46.440 --> 22:48.720
Mr Carey, I assure you,
we'll go on working.

22:48.920 --> 22:51.160
Every day we'll push
our knowledge further

22:51.360 --> 22:53.640
until one day we might
have the whole answer.

22:53.840 --> 22:56.000
Thank you, Doctor.

23:05.080 --> 23:08.480
<i>My relationships with the world
had ceased with everyone...</i>

23:08.680 --> 23:10.520
<i>...except my wife.</i>

23:10.720 --> 23:13.320
<i>And I knew I was driving Lou from me.</i>

23:13.520 --> 23:17.960
<i>But burning inside, adding its own
hideous pressure to everything else,</i>

23:18.160 --> 23:21.520
<i>was my desperate need for her.</i>

23:23.560 --> 23:27.920
- You want the paper, Scott?
- No. No thank you.

23:28.960 --> 23:34.160
Well I think I'll turn in. Come on.

23:35.240 --> 23:38.200
- Coming to bed?
- Yeah, soon.

23:38.400 --> 23:42.800
- Well, good night then.
- Good night, Louise.

23:46.800 --> 23:51.200
<i>I felt puny and absurd.
A ludicrous midget.</i>

23:51.400 --> 23:55.000
<i>Easy enough to talk of
soul and spirit and essential worth.</i>

23:55.200 --> 23:57.680
<i>But not when you're three feet tall.</i>

23:57.880 --> 24:03.160
<i>I loathed myself. Our home, the
caricature my life with Lou had become.</i>

24:04.200 --> 24:09.000
<i>I had to get out. I had to get away.</i>

24:12.080 --> 24:16.360
<i>For the first time since it happened,
I ran into the night. Alone.</i>

24:24.560 --> 24:29.520
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Here it is,
folks! The greatest show in the Midwest!

24:29.720 --> 24:33.440
Come on in and see all
the freaks and curiosities!

24:33.640 --> 24:38.560
See Dolly Dumpling, the fat lady!
She weighs 840 pounds!

24:38.760 --> 24:40.960
When she sits down,
she shakes and quivers

24:41.160 --> 24:44.720
like a bowl of jelly
on a cold and frosty morning!

24:44.920 --> 24:48.160
See Flamo! Flamo, the Fire-eater!

24:48.360 --> 24:53.360
Here is one of the greatest attractions
you'll ever see in your born days!

24:53.560 --> 24:57.560
You will remember these sights
for the rest of your natural life!

24:57.760 --> 24:59.320
Time for the big show.

24:59.520 --> 25:02.800
I would like you to meet a few
of the exhibits here on the platform.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.120
First we have Tiny Tina!

25:06.320 --> 25:11.480
Here she is. 36-and-a-half inches
of feminine pulchritude.

25:11.680 --> 25:16.280
You'll see freaks and curiosities
assembled from every part of the globe!

25:16.480 --> 25:20.440
The most unusual aberrations
assembled under this tent!

25:20.640 --> 25:23.480
Contrived by a tricky Mother Nature!

25:23.680 --> 25:26.120
Here they are in all their glory!

25:26.320 --> 25:30.960
This exhibit is not only entertaining,
it's educating...

26:02.480 --> 26:04.440
Hello.

26:05.640 --> 26:10.640
- Mind if I sit down?
- No. Please do.

26:15.680 --> 26:17.680
- Don't be late, Clarice.
- I won't.

26:17.880 --> 26:19.640
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:19.840 --> 26:23.560
- Pass me the sugar, huh?
- Oh, sure.

26:25.720 --> 26:28.480
I haven't seen you here before.
You with the carnival?

26:28.680 --> 26:31.120
Oh, no, I... No.

26:31.320 --> 26:34.400
- Just visiting then, huh?
- Yeah.

26:37.480 --> 26:41.560
- I'm Clarice Bruce.
- My name's Scott Carey.

26:41.760 --> 26:44.040
Hi, Scott.

26:47.040 --> 26:49.680
Scott Carey?

26:49.880 --> 26:52.200
I'm sorry,
maybe you don't want any company.

26:52.400 --> 26:57.560
No, don't go.
I want you to stay. Talk to me.

26:59.600 --> 27:03.000
- All right.
- How do you live with it, Miss Bruce?

27:03.200 --> 27:06.040
- What do you do?
- I was born a midget.

27:06.240 --> 27:10.360
It's the way I grew up. I know it's
happened to you and that's different.

27:10.560 --> 27:13.440
Different? That's another
way of saying alone, isn't it?

27:13.640 --> 27:15.800
Oh, but you're not alone now.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.240
Still, it must be hard
to forget the way things were.

27:19.440 --> 27:21.520
Yeah,
I'd like to burn it out of my mind.

27:21.720 --> 27:24.920
Maybe the best way to begin
is to start thinking about the future.

27:25.120 --> 27:30.320
- A future? In a world of giants?
- I've lived with them all my life.

27:30.520 --> 27:34.280
Oh, Scott, for people like you and me
the world can be a wonderful place.

27:34.480 --> 27:39.720
The sky is as blue as it is for the
giants. The friends are as warm.

27:39.920 --> 27:44.600
- I wish I could believe that.
- You've got to believe that.

27:44.800 --> 27:47.400
- Don't you?
- Yeah.

27:47.600 --> 27:50.400
Give me time, Clarice. I'll learn.

27:52.680 --> 27:57.320
- Oh! I'll be late for my show!
- Oh, look, can I see you again?

27:57.520 --> 28:00.920
- Mmm. If you like.
- I would.

28:01.120 --> 28:04.680
You know, Scott?
You're taller than I am.

28:04.880 --> 28:06.840
May I?

28:09.120 --> 28:10.880
Thank you.

28:12.640 --> 28:17.080
<i>That night I got a grip on life again.
I went back to work on my book.</i>

28:17.280 --> 28:19.960
<i>It absorbed me completely.</i>

28:20.160 --> 28:22.640
<i>I was telling the world
of my experience.</i>

28:22.840 --> 28:27.200
<i>And with the telling, it became easier.</i>

28:34.520 --> 28:37.240
- I think it's just fine, Scott.
- Do you really think so?

28:37.440 --> 28:40.360
I'm not much of a writer.
Just tryin' to tell what it's like.

28:40.560 --> 28:43.080
You don't know what it's meant to me,
meeting you.

28:43.280 --> 28:46.240
- Someone who understands.
- But you're so much better now.

28:46.440 --> 28:47.600
Thanks to you.

28:47.800 --> 28:50.920
Aw, not to me. Yourself.
You just stopped running, that's all.

28:51.120 --> 28:54.280
All I know is I can wake up in the
morning and want to live again.

28:54.480 --> 28:56.240
Actually want to live.

28:56.440 --> 29:00.440
It's a funny thing. Sometimes I begin
to think it's the world that's changed.

29:00.640 --> 29:03.200
- I'm the normal one
- That sounds like a good thing.

29:03.400 --> 29:06.800
Everybody out of step but you and me.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.560
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.
We can talk about another chapter.

29:11.800 --> 29:14.520
What is it, Scott?

29:14.720 --> 29:18.360
Two weeks ago I was taller than you.
You said so yourself.

29:18.560 --> 29:21.000
- Yes, I remember, but...
- Well can't you see?

29:21.200 --> 29:24.120
- I'm shorter now.
- Oh, Scott.

29:24.320 --> 29:28.200
It's starting again. It's starting.

29:28.400 --> 29:30.360
It's starting again!

29:49.400 --> 29:53.520
Scott? Scott?

29:57.080 --> 30:00.840
- Scott? Are you in there?
- Do you have to make such a racket?

30:01.040 --> 30:05.760
- I told you what happens in there!
- I'm sorry, Scott. I try to be careful.

30:05.960 --> 30:10.120
- Are you going out?
- Yes, for a little while.

30:10.320 --> 30:13.360
- Where?
- Just to the corner. To the store.

30:13.560 --> 30:17.160
- You'll come right back?
- Well of course I will.

30:17.360 --> 30:21.320
Why don't you try to get some rest?
Dr Silver wants to see you tomorrow.

30:21.520 --> 30:26.240
All right, go ahead.
Be sure the doors are locked!

30:58.120 --> 31:03.240
<i>Every day it was worse.
Every day a little smaller.</i>

31:03.440 --> 31:05.720
<i>And every day I became more tyrannical,</i>

31:05.920 --> 31:08.960
<i>more monstrous
in my domination of Louise.</i>

31:09.160 --> 31:12.160
<i>Heaven knows how
she lived through those weeks.</i>

31:13.200 --> 31:16.200
<i>Only I had the power to release her.</i>

31:16.400 --> 31:20.480
<i>If I could find the courage
to end my wretched existence.</i>

31:21.880 --> 31:26.160
<i>But each day I thought,
"perhaps tomorrow".</i>

31:26.360 --> 31:29.040
<i>Tomorrow the doctors will save me.</i>

34:54.600 --> 34:55.639
Scott!

35:15.320 --> 35:19.320
No. No. No.

35:21.520 --> 35:25.600
Oh, Scott. Scott.

35:30.200 --> 35:33.360
... drew deafening applause
when he announced that if elected

35:33.560 --> 35:37.200
he will do everything in his power
to reduce taxes.

35:37.400 --> 35:42.920
From Los Ángeles today, a tragic story.
The passing of Robert Scott Carey.

35:43.120 --> 35:47.120
The report of the death of the so-called
Shrinking Man comes from his brother.

35:47.320 --> 35:50.960
Carey's death was the result of an
attack by a common house cat,

35:51.160 --> 35:53.760
a former pet in the Carey home.

35:53.960 --> 35:58.440
He was the victim of the most fantastic
ailment in the annals of medicine.

35:58.640 --> 36:02.600
Thus ends the life of a man
whose courage and will to survive

36:02.800 --> 36:06.920
lasted until the the very end.
A man whose fantastic story

36:07.120 --> 36:10.800
was known to virtually every man,
woman and child in the civilised world.

36:11.000 --> 36:14.240
- Mr Carey?
- Yes?

36:14.440 --> 36:17.480
- You may go up. She wants to see you.
- Is she all right?

36:17.680 --> 36:21.120
The doctor gave her a heavy sedative
but it's hardly working at all.

36:21.320 --> 36:23.880
- I see.
- I'll get that prescription filled.

36:24.080 --> 36:26.520
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Fine.

36:45.880 --> 36:50.360
<i>My return to consciousness
was a plunge into a new level of pain.</i>

36:50.560 --> 36:53.200
<i>I realised I had fallen into a box.</i>

36:53.400 --> 36:57.800
<i>Its walls enclosed me
like some gigantic pit.</i>

37:05.720 --> 37:08.120
<i>I had to escape out of the box.</i>

37:08.320 --> 37:11.400
<i>Somehow I had to reach Louise,
to survive.</i>

38:17.320 --> 38:20.760
<i>The stairs stretched above me
as far as I could see.</i>

38:20.960 --> 38:23.680
<i>Cliff rising upon cliff.</i>

38:23.880 --> 38:26.080
<i>I knew I could never scale them.</i>

38:26.840 --> 38:28.320
Louise!

38:29.680 --> 38:34.680
Louise! The cellar! Look in the cellar!

38:34.880 --> 38:38.600
Louise! Please look for me! Louise!

38:41.080 --> 38:44.000
<i>Eventually Louise would
come to the cellar.</i>

38:44.200 --> 38:46.200
<i>Until then, I had to keep myself alive</i>

38:46.400 --> 38:51.480
<i>with whatever resources I could discover
in my basement universe. And in myself.</i>

39:37.280 --> 39:41.280
<i>The cellar floor stretched before me
like some vast primeval plain.</i>

39:41.480 --> 39:45.280
<i>Empty of life. Littered with the relics
of a vanished race.</i>

39:45.480 --> 39:48.680
<i>No desert island castaway
ever faced so bleak a prospect.</i>

40:17.960 --> 40:23.040
<i>I had discovered a water supply,
and even a dwelling place.</i>

40:24.400 --> 40:27.400
<i>Now, the search for food.</i>

40:29.600 --> 40:32.000
<i>I knew my ill-fitting clothes
were unsuited</i>

40:32.200 --> 40:34.320
<i>to the exertions that lay before me.</i>

40:58.800 --> 41:02.760
- You can't stay here, Louise. Not now.
- I... I don't know, Charlie.

41:02.960 --> 41:05.800
- I don't know what I wanna do.
- Lou, let me help you.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.040
You can stay with us,
but get out of here.

41:08.240 --> 41:12.440
If I could just be sure.
Charlie, maybe he's hurt someplace.

41:12.640 --> 41:15.440
- Maybe he's lost.
- We've looked everywhere. He's dead.

41:15.640 --> 41:19.200
I'm his own brother. I wouldn't
say a thing like that if I wasn't sure.

41:19.400 --> 41:22.480
- You saw the cat.
- All right, all right.

41:22.680 --> 41:28.040
Charlie, have you thought
how horrible it must have been?

41:28.240 --> 41:32.840
I just keep thinking that he needed me
and I wasn't there.

41:33.040 --> 41:34.720
- I wasn't there.
- Louise.

41:34.920 --> 41:38.160
You've got to get it out of your mind.

41:38.360 --> 41:41.320
I'll never get it out of my mind.

41:41.520 --> 41:43.880
I'll talk to the real estate people.

41:49.000 --> 41:52.200
<i>I never doubted that
sometime Louise would come.</i>

41:52.400 --> 41:54.960
<i>I couldn't allow myself to doubt.</i>

41:55.160 --> 42:00.640
<i>I had only to exist.
To search out enough food to sustain me.</i>

42:00.840 --> 42:02.720
<i>I was driven by hunger.</i>

42:02.920 --> 42:05.960
<i>And also by the horrible thought
that without nourishment,</i>

42:06.160 --> 42:08.360
<i>the shrinking process was quickening.</i>

51:07.440 --> 51:10.280
<i>I was weak and faint.</i>

51:10.480 --> 51:14.520
<i>Yet I knew, in order to exist,
I must eat.</i>

51:14.720 --> 51:18.120
<i>The food was still
a long climb ahead of me.</i>

51:29.720 --> 51:35.520
<i>But now, stretching endlessly before me,
I found a deep abyss.</i>

51:35.720 --> 51:38.640
<i>It was only a box and the space between.</i>

51:38.840 --> 51:43.280
<i>Yet to me it was the Grand Canyon
and the Mammoth Caves combined.</i>

51:43.480 --> 51:48.560
<i>Deep, dark, mysterious and dangerous.</i>

51:49.600 --> 51:52.560
<i>There was no possible way to cross,</i>

51:52.760 --> 51:57.560
<i>no matter how inventive,
how resourceful I thought myself.</i>

51:57.760 --> 52:03.440
<i>This time, in sight of my goal,
it seemed as if I must meet defeat.</i>

52:09.520 --> 52:12.360
<i>Suddenly I saw an opportunity,</i>

52:12.560 --> 52:15.520
<i>if I could move the stick
to the other side.</i>

52:16.720 --> 52:22.520
<i>I cursed myself. If only I were
a little bigger. A little stronger.</i>

52:28.240 --> 52:31.160
<i>I realised there was
just this one chance,</i>

52:31.360 --> 52:35.760
<i>and I had no choice, I had to take it.</i>

52:35.960 --> 52:40.360
<i>If I could leap from the paint stick
and reach the other side...</i>

52:40.560 --> 52:44.280
<i>But there was no time to think.
Only to act.</i>

56:49.200 --> 56:51.200
<i>My prison.</i>

56:51.400 --> 56:57.360
<i>Almost as far as I could see, a grave,
friendless area of space and time.</i>

57:00.080 --> 57:04.760
<i>And I resolved that as Man had
dominated the world of the sun,</i>

57:04.960 --> 57:07.920
<i>so I would dominate my world.</i>

59:49.760 --> 59:53.960
<i>In my hunt for food,
I had become the hunted.</i>

59:55.080 --> 59:57.600
<i>This time I survived.</i>

59:57.800 --> 01:00:03.320
<i>But I was no longer alone
in my universe. I had an enemy.</i>

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:07.280
<i>The most terrifying
ever beheld by human eyes.</i>

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:16.440
Charlie, there's a trunk I'd like to
take with me if you don't mind.

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:20.160
- It's in the basement. I'll show you.
- I'll put these in the car first.

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:22.000
Oh, all right.

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:53.480
Oh no, it's flooded!

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:56.840
The water heater.
I better have a look.

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:01.480
- Oh, this is terrible.
- I'll turn the water off.

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:06.400
Louise! Look for me! Louise! Charlie!

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:11.400
Charlie, I'm here! Charlie! Louise!

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:15.120
The water! Here in the water!

01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:17.120
Charlie!

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:22.800
I smell gas. Is that pilot off?

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.880
I'll turn it off.

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:28.360
Listen to me! Louise!

01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:32.400
Louise! Hear me! Please! Please!

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:35.320
- Can you fix it?
- There.

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:37.400
I'll get a plumber down here tomorrow.

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:43.400
Charlie!

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:50.480
- Where's your drain?
- It's there. It must be clogged.

01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:52.640
Charlie! Look for me!

01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:25.520
- Is that the trunk, Louise?
- Oh, yes, but don't bother about it.

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:28.520
- It's so wet. I'll pick it up later.
- It's OK.

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:31.360
I want you packed
and out of this house tonight.

01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:10.840
- Is that everything, Louise?
- Yes, that's everything.

01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:13.880
<i>I still had my weapons. With these
bits of metal I was a man again.</i>

01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:16.520
<i>If I was to die,
it would not be as a helpless insect</i>

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:18.800
<i>in thejaws of the spider monster.</i>

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:23.760
<i>A strange calm possessed me.</i>

01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:28.240
<i>I thought more clearly
than I had ever thought before,</i>

01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:32.440
<i>as if my mind were
bathed in a brilliant light.</i>

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:36.560
<i>I recognised that
part of my illness was rooted in hunger,</i>

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:42.240
<i>and I remembered the food on the shelf.
The cake threaded with spider web.</i>

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:46.040
<i>I no longer felt hatred for the spider.</i>

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:50.800
<i>Like myself, it struggled blindly
for the means to live.</i>

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.720
<i>If I was to fight it,
if I was to win the food,</i>

01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:56.720
<i>then it must be now
while strength remained,</i>

01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:00.120
<i>while I was still of sufficient size
to scale the wall.</i>

01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:04.800
<i>It was not decision that
drove me to the crate, but reflex,</i>

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.080
<i>as instinctive as the spider's.</i>

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:15.360
<i>My legs trembled.
Not with fear, but weakness.</i>

01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:19.680
<i>Yet somehow I felt within myself
a new source of power.</i>

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:24.200
<i>A giant strength,
urging me to the death struggle.</i>

01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:14.920
<i>My enemy seemed immortal.</i>

01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:19.800
<i>More than a spider, it was
every unknown terror in the world,</i>

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:24.600
<i>every fear fused into
one hideous night-black horror.</i>

01:08:26.439 --> 01:08:30.880
<i>Still, whatever else had happened,
my brain was a man's brain.</i>

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:34.760
<i>My intelligence
still a man's intelligence.</i>

01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:39.240
<i>An idea came to me. The scissors.</i>

01:08:39.439 --> 01:08:43.960
<i>Too heavy for me to employ as a weapon,
they might have another use.</i>

01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:46.439
<i>If I could impale the monster
with my hook,</i>

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:52.120
<i>fastened by a line to the scissors,
then push the scissors off the ledge.</i>

01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:59.640
<i>Whatever the risk, it was worth a try.</i>

01:09:22.279 --> 01:09:25.680
<i>I knew, sooner or later,
it would come charging down that web,</i>

01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:30.840
<i>skimming out blackly toward me.
One of us had to die.</i>

01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:10.680
<i>Come on down!</i>

01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:15.720
<i>Come on, you devil, I'm waiting for you!
Come on!</i>

01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:12.080
<i>This was the prize I had won.</i>

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:16.200
<i>I approached it
in an ecstasy of elation.</i>

01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:21.920
<i>I had conquered. I lived.</i>

01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:58.680
<i>But even as I touched the dry,
flaking crumbs of nourishment</i>

01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:02.560
<i>it was as if my body
had ceased to exist.</i>

01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:08.400
<i>There was no hunger. No longer
the terrible fear of shrinking.</i>

01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:21.600
<i>Again I had the sensation of instinct.</i>

01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:27.520
<i>Of each movement, each thought
tuned to some great directing force.</i>

01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:53.680
<i>I was continuing to shrink, to become...</i>

01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:57.400
<i>What? The infinitesimal?</i>

01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:01.040
<i>What was I?</i>

01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:03.760
<i>Still a human being?</i>

01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:07.360
<i>Or was I the man of the future?</i>

01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:21.240
<i>If there were other bursts of radiation,</i>

01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:25.600
<i>other clouds drifting
across seas and continents,</i>

01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:30.320
<i>would other beings follow me
into this vast new world?</i>

01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:35.400
<i>So close,
the infinitesimal and the infinite.</i>

01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:42.360
<i>But suddenly I knew they were really
the two ends of the same concept.</i>

01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:47.680
<i>The unbelievably small and the
unbelievably vast eventually meet,</i>

01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:50.920
<i>like the closing of a gigantic circle.</i>

01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:55.320
<i>I looked up,</i>

01:15:55.520 --> 01:16:00.360
<i>as if somehow I would
grasp the heavens, the universe,</i>

01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:05.600
<i>worlds beyond number. God's silver
tapestry spread across the night.</i>

01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:12.480
<i>And in that moment I knew the
answer to the riddle of the infinite.</i>

01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:17.080
<i>I had thought in terms of
Man's own limited dimension.</i>

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:20.000
<i>I had presumed upon Nature.</i>

01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:26.160
<i>That existence begins and ends
is Man's conception, not Nature's.</i>

01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:30.280
<i>And I felt my body dwindling,</i>

01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:34.760
<i>melting, becoming nothing.</i>

01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:40.280
<i>My fears melted away
and in their place came acceptance.</i>

01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:46.560
<i>All this vast majesty of creation,
it had to mean something.</i>

01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:49.680
<i>And then I meant something too.</i>

01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:54.680
<i>Yes, smaller than the smallest,
I meant something too.</i>

01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:59.320
<i>To God, there is no zero.</i>

01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:01.480
<i>I still exist.</i>
