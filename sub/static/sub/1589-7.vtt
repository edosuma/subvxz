00:01.160 --> 00:02.092
ANNOUNCER: Previously on
Pretty Little Liars...

00:03.400 --> 00:04.367
( phones beeping )
It's from "A".

00:04.400 --> 00:05.526
"Did you miss me, bitches?"

00:06.540 --> 00:07.689
( screams )

00:07.740 --> 00:10.231
You need to give me
those names, Paige.

00:10.270 --> 00:11.498
ARIA: Eddie wants
Ezra to know

00:11.540 --> 00:12.700
that there's something
to look into at Radley.

00:12.740 --> 00:15.129
Oh, my God, I think that's
supposed to be Mrs. DiLaurentis.

00:15.180 --> 00:17.375
Mrs. D was on the board
at Radley Sanitarium.

00:17.410 --> 00:19.071
Bethany was a patient there.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.769
Bethany was buried
in her yard.

00:20.820 --> 00:23.118
You think that "A" killed
Bethany and Mrs. D?

00:23.150 --> 00:24.686
Is there something going on
between you two?

00:24.720 --> 00:26.381
Yeah, that would be
a connection.
A slip?

00:26.420 --> 00:28.786
Caleb, I had no idea
when you'd come back

00:28.820 --> 00:29.752
or if you'd ever come back.

00:29.790 --> 00:31.121
I won't be staying long.

00:31.160 --> 00:32.650
Your hair, your clothes,

00:32.700 --> 00:34.520
a lots changed with you
since she's been back.

00:34.560 --> 00:36.494
Oh, yeah, and nothing's
changed with you?

00:36.530 --> 00:39.090
Lucas _and Melissa
are working wnth Mona.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.334
And they're all
after Alison.

00:41.440 --> 00:42.634
( screams )

00:42.670 --> 00:44.262
They remember
how Alison treated them.

00:44.310 --> 00:46.437
They don't want things to go
back to the way they were.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.129
Then maybe we can
really get rid of her.

00:48.180 --> 00:51.069
( grunting )

00:55.150 --> 00:57.289
Mr. Ibarra is the only
teacher of yours

00:57.320 --> 00:59.254
who wouldn't schedule
a Video conference With me

00:59.290 --> 01:01.087
while I was in Texas
with your dad.

01:01.120 --> 01:02.621
Is he new?

01:02.660 --> 01:04.548
Yes,
and he's very low-tech.

01:04.590 --> 01:06.558
He won't even use an
electric penCIl sharpener.

01:12.140 --> 01:13.368
Bye, Mom.

01:13.400 --> 01:14.799
Uh, Emily, wait a second.

01:15.870 --> 01:17.303
I just had a thought.

01:17.340 --> 01:20.309
Ask Alison to come by
for dinner.

01:20.340 --> 01:21.307
VVhen?

01:21.340 --> 01:22.375
Tonight.

01:22.410 --> 01:23.399
Tonight?

01:23.450 --> 01:25.145
Yeah. Spur of the moment.

01:25.180 --> 01:26.169
And you know what?

01:26.220 --> 01:27.175
Ask the other girls
to come, too.

01:27.220 --> 01:29.347
She was just at the house.

01:29.390 --> 01:32.257
Well, I know, but we didn't
really get a chance to talk.

01:32.290 --> 01:33.757
And with everything
Alison's been through,

01:33.790 --> 01:35.849
I just want her to know
that if she needs an ear

01:35.890 --> 01:38.529
that's attached to an adult,
I'm here for her.

01:38.560 --> 01:40.357
Okay.

01:42.470 --> 01:43.562
All of us?

01:43.600 --> 01:45.522
What does your mom
want with all of us?

01:45.570 --> 01:47.697
Well, I think
she's mostly asking Ali.

01:47.740 --> 01:49.833
That's not like your mom.

01:49.870 --> 01:50.632
She's a planner.

01:50.670 --> 01:52.274
Okay, I'm pretty sure
Emily's mom is

01:52.310 --> 01:53.902
not one of_ _
Mona's secret ninjas.

01:53.940 --> 01:56.272
Are we supposed to be
suspicious of everyone now?

01:56.310 --> 01:57.868
It saves time.

01:57.910 --> 01:59.844
Well, I don't think I'm gonna be
finished at Radley.

01:59.880 --> 02:01.768
I can't just put
that Bethany drawing

02:01.820 --> 02:03.708
up on the bulletin board
with my phone number.

02:03.750 --> 02:05.286
It's gonna take a while.

02:05.320 --> 02:06.912
"A" is not gonna
give us a while.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.757
Hey, are you going to
Ezra's later to help him

02:08.790 --> 02:10.451
move his research
and spy stuff?

02:10.490 --> 02:11.787
Sure.

02:11.830 --> 02:14.549
Look, Em, I will try
to make it, but...

02:14.600 --> 02:15.897
Can you put your mom off?

02:15.930 --> 02:17.795
No, not without
an epic excuse.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.764
Okay.

02:20.800 --> 02:22.768
Then we'll just do it,
get it over with.

02:22.810 --> 02:24.903
Your wish is our command.

02:24.940 --> 02:27.272
What is that
supposed to mean?

02:27.310 --> 02:28.299
( school bell ringing )

02:28.340 --> 02:29.477
I have to go to class.

02:34.820 --> 02:35.878
Hey!

02:35.920 --> 02:39.913
Um, do you think you can
walk me home after school?

02:39.960 --> 02:41.712
Everything that happened
with "A" at my house was

02:41.760 --> 02:42.784
just really intense.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.923
Sure.

02:44.960 --> 02:47.190
How's your arm?

02:47.230 --> 02:49.596
It's okay.
I'll be fine.

02:49.630 --> 02:52.463
I don't know
if I'll be fine.

02:52.500 --> 02:54.661
Do you think the teachers
will see my bruises?

02:54.700 --> 02:55.792
And what if they
ask questions?

02:55.840 --> 02:56.966
I mean,
that's the kind of thing

02:57.010 --> 02:58.705
that they have to report,
don't they?

02:58.740 --> 03:00.332
Ali, breathe.

03:00.380 --> 03:02.598
The concealer covers
most of It anyway.

03:04.880 --> 03:07.417
Hey, Emily.

03:07.450 --> 03:08.712
Hi, Sydney.

03:08.750 --> 03:11.810
You must be Alison.
I'm Sydney.

03:11.850 --> 03:13.750
That's a beautiful scarf.

03:17.990 --> 03:20.424
* Got a secret,
can you keep it? *

03:20.460 --> 03:22.826
* Swear this one you'll save

03:22.870 --> 03:25.521
_* Better lock it
In your pocket *

03:25.570 --> 03:27.959
* Taking this one
to the grave *

03:28.000 --> 03:29.934
* If I show you
then I know *

03:29.970 --> 03:32.939
* You won't tell what I said

03:32.980 --> 03:35.574
* 'Cause two can
keep a secret *

03:35.610 --> 03:37.840
* If one of them is dead

03:40.820 --> 03:41.775
A rat?

03:41.820 --> 03:44.288
Yesterday, after practice.

03:44.320 --> 03:45.116
I heard her screaming.

03:45.150 --> 03:47.789
Somebody put
a dead rat in her cap.

03:47.820 --> 03:48.855
You didn't hear about this?

03:48.890 --> 03:49.822
No.

03:49.860 --> 03:51.327
She was shaking all over.

03:51.360 --> 03:53.794
I guess she has a thing
with rodents.

03:53.830 --> 03:54.797
Who did it?

03:54.830 --> 03:55.819
No one's fessed up.

03:55.860 --> 03:58.522
Coach wants a team meeting,
but I don't think

03:58.570 --> 03:59.594
it was someone
on the Sharks.

03:59.640 --> 04:00.868
Everyone loves Paige.

04:00.900 --> 04:02.868
Likes her, I mean.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.730
Well, I haven't seen her yet.

04:04.770 --> 04:06.772
I don't think
she came to school.

04:09.010 --> 04:10.671
You okay, Emily?

04:10.710 --> 04:12.371
Yeah, I'm fine.

04:15.720 --> 04:16.812
What do you know
about this?

04:18.520 --> 04:20.010
You're gonna
have to give me a hint.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.618
What happened to Paige?

04:21.660 --> 04:23.321
Oh, the rat.

04:23.360 --> 04:26.295
Ah, God, it makes me irked
just to think about it.

04:26.330 --> 04:27.558
Hey, Sydney.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.420
Hey.

04:29.470 --> 04:32.564
Such a creepy thing to do
to someone as sweet as Paige.

04:32.600 --> 04:33.862
How is she?

04:33.900 --> 04:35.060
She stayed home today.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.465
Scared.

04:36.510 --> 04:39.035
A dead rat has "boy"
written all over it.

04:39.070 --> 04:41.732
Any particular boy?

04:41.780 --> 04:42.769
None comes to mind.

04:42.810 --> 04:44.801
Not even Noel Kahn?

04:48.480 --> 04:50.983
He lent me his notes
as a favor.

04:51.020 --> 04:52.908
Later.

05:10.010 --> 05:10.908
Caleb?

05:12.710 --> 05:13.972
What are you doing here?

05:14.010 --> 05:15.329
( sighs )

05:15.380 --> 05:16.745
Exit exams.

05:16.780 --> 05:18.941
Well, how's reading about
monsters gonna help you?

05:18.980 --> 05:21.448
Shouldn't you be
studying?

05:21.480 --> 05:22.447
I'll wing it.

05:22.490 --> 05:23.684
You can't wing it.

05:23.720 --> 05:25.119
It's like all of high school
in one test.

05:25.150 --> 05:26.708
Look, I'm good. Okay?

05:26.760 --> 05:29.820
If they ask who signed
the Emancipation Proclamation,

05:29.860 --> 05:30.986
I'll say Daniel Day Lewis.

05:31.030 --> 05:32.998
What?

05:33.030 --> 05:35.021
I believed it.

05:41.500 --> 05:42.569
Sorry.

05:42.610 --> 05:44.009
I should've asked.

05:45.010 --> 05:46.500
You never did.

05:51.910 --> 05:53.070
So what's going on?

05:53.120 --> 05:55.111
What do you mean?

05:55.150 --> 05:56.412
You only eat three at a time

05:56.450 --> 05:57.986
when you're bugging out
about something.

05:59.150 --> 06:00.219
Is it about Alison?

06:01.890 --> 06:04.085
Okay, Emily's mom is making
dinner for her tonight.

06:04.130 --> 06:05.586
And we all have to be there

06:05.630 --> 06:08.849
in case Mrs. Fields
decides to grill her, too.

06:08.900 --> 06:10.822
Why do you all have
to be there?

06:10.870 --> 06:12.861
How much immoral support
does Alison need?

06:12.900 --> 06:14.128
Caleb.

06:14.170 --> 06:15.990
If you're gonna make a break,
just do it.

06:16.040 --> 06:17.462
It's not that easy.

06:17.510 --> 06:19.774
I didn't say
it wouldn't be messy.

06:19.810 --> 06:22.574
Caleb, I've been
through a divorce. Okay?

06:22.610 --> 06:25.101
It's not just about
cutting off Alison.

06:25.150 --> 06:27.015
I don't want to get
into some weird custody battle

06:27.050 --> 06:28.472
over our friends.

06:28.520 --> 06:31.387
Well, if you lose them,
you've always got me.

06:39.030 --> 06:40.895
I should probably get in there.

06:40.930 --> 06:42.898
I could use the next
10 minutes to figure out

06:42.930 --> 06:44.898
why there are three branches
of government.

06:44.930 --> 06:46.659
Good luck.

07:13.230 --> 07:14.197
Hey there.

07:14.230 --> 07:15.959
You the new volunteer?

07:20.040 --> 07:21.098
Aria?

07:25.610 --> 07:27.032
I mangled it, didn't I?

07:27.080 --> 07:28.934
What?

07:28.980 --> 07:31.778
Your name on the badge.

07:33.980 --> 07:35.743
Oh, no.

07:35.780 --> 07:37.088
No, you got it right.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.549
Did you volunteer for the
reading program last year?

07:44.160 --> 07:46.651
Nope.
No, this is my first time here.

07:48.230 --> 07:49.993
Feel like we've met before.

07:53.970 --> 07:55.130
I don't think so.

08:06.010 --> 08:07.568
It's good to see you again,

08:07.620 --> 08:09.474
now that the smoke
has cleared.

08:11.050 --> 08:13.655
Yeah, my ears are
still ringing.

08:15.920 --> 08:17.854
Well, I'm glad
I'm not the only one

08:17.890 --> 08:18.982
that has to take these tests.

08:19.030 --> 08:21.294
I'm taking them to get out,

08:21.330 --> 08:22.888
you're taking them to get in.

08:24.900 --> 08:28.893
Either way, it all comes down
to the same thing.

08:28.940 --> 08:33.309
Pass-fail, win-lose.

08:33.340 --> 08:34.739
Is that what you learned
those two years

08:34.780 --> 08:35.929
someone had you in a box?

08:41.650 --> 08:43.186
I got out of the box,
didn't I?

08:43.220 --> 08:45.017
With a little help
from your friends.

08:45.050 --> 08:48.588
Everybody needs
someone to depend on.

08:48.620 --> 08:50.656
You seem to need
a lot of support.

08:50.690 --> 08:54.126
I'm not sure
I know what you mean.

08:54.160 --> 08:55.752
I'm not sure either.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.893
I don't know you
that well.

08:57.930 --> 08:59.261
You don't know me at all.

08:59.300 --> 09:00.995
That's right.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.759
I just know you
from what you leave behind.

09:03.810 --> 09:05.209
Like a tornado.

09:08.640 --> 09:10.904
Notice how the artist
used the paint.

09:10.950 --> 09:13.145
He wanted to capture a feeling
as much as the flower.

09:13.180 --> 09:15.011
I want you to do the same.

09:15.050 --> 09:18.611
Use any color that expresses
how the flower makes you feel.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.313
No, Donna,
don't do that.

09:21.360 --> 09:23.180
There are
no mistakes, guys.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.858
Great paintings often
come out of mistakes.

09:25.890 --> 09:27.027
Aria, would you mind
spreading out

09:27.060 --> 09:28.322
the other prints
on the table?

09:39.370 --> 09:40.974
( indistinct chatter )

09:51.020 --> 09:52.044
Thief.

09:54.920 --> 09:56.353
Thief.

09:56.390 --> 09:57.618
Rhonda.

09:57.660 --> 09:58.979
It's one thing
to not participate,

09:59.030 --> 10:00.258
it's another to disrupt.

10:00.300 --> 10:01.927
She stole my drawing!

10:01.960 --> 10:02.767
No, she didn't.

10:02.800 --> 10:05.928
This is Aria's
first class with us.

10:05.970 --> 10:08.029
Just ignore her.
She's having a day.

10:08.070 --> 10:09.196
What happened?

10:09.240 --> 10:11.003
Police may have upset her.

10:11.040 --> 10:14.009
That patient they found dead
was her former roommate.

10:26.290 --> 10:28.178
Hey, when did you
get back?

10:29.790 --> 10:30.859
Last night.

10:30.890 --> 10:31.857
Where's Dad?

10:31.890 --> 10:33.721
My apartment.

10:33.760 --> 10:34.795
Ithought
I'd give him some space

10:34.830 --> 10:37.958
and come here and maybe
talk some sense into Mom.

10:39.970 --> 10:40.994
Is he okay?

10:42.170 --> 10:44.331
He's all right
for the moment.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.146
Have you been
in the barn lately?

10:50.180 --> 10:52.000
No. No one has.

10:52.050 --> 10:54.416
Not since Mom fired
my sober-buddy. Why?

10:54.450 --> 10:57.339
He may have been sober,
but he was a lousy housekeeper.

10:57.390 --> 10:58.880
He left food out.

10:58.920 --> 11:01.150
Oh.

11:01.190 --> 11:03.055
Dad wants to sell
the house.

11:05.060 --> 11:06.152
Maybe they should.

11:06.190 --> 11:08.021
The house, Melissa.

11:08.060 --> 11:10.119
This is our home.

11:12.400 --> 11:14.288
Let me throw this away
and then we can talk.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.160
No, if he left a mess,
I should clean it up.

11:16.200 --> 11:17.701
He was here for me--
No, it's okay.

11:17.740 --> 11:19.162
Just let me do something,
okay? Please.

11:19.210 --> 11:21.201
Spencen
What is in here?

11:24.250 --> 11:25.308
Oh, my God!

11:32.990 --> 11:35.049
I told you
he left food out.

11:38.230 --> 11:40.221
I have to go wash
my hands now.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.967
( knocking on door)

11:52.980 --> 11:53.878
Where have you been?

11:53.910 --> 11:56.003
I got your S.O.S.
when I was at the store.

11:56.040 --> 11:57.803
What's going on?
What's wrong?

11:57.850 --> 11:59.044
What did you say to Alison?

12:00.250 --> 12:01.342
What?

12:01.380 --> 12:03.189
She just left me
a message, pissed.

12:03.220 --> 12:04.346
What did you say to her?

12:04.390 --> 12:06.950
Were you trying
to catch her in a lie?

12:06.990 --> 12:08.287
I don't need
to catch her, okay?

12:08.320 --> 12:10.288
I'm way ahead of her.

12:10.330 --> 12:12.958
Besides who cares
if Alison's pissed?

12:13.000 --> 12:14.228
You're trying to dump her
anyway, right?

12:14.260 --> 12:16.967
I don't need you
to do that for me.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.228
What is that?

12:18.270 --> 12:20.067
It's a beer.

12:20.100 --> 12:21.965
What are we celebrating?

12:22.000 --> 12:24.059
My freedom.

12:24.110 --> 12:26.101
I walked out
of that stupid test.

12:26.140 --> 12:28.176
Caleb, why would you
do that?

12:28.210 --> 12:30.075
Because Algebra
and Civics,

12:30.110 --> 12:32.442
they don't mean a damn thing
in the real world, Hanna.

12:32.480 --> 12:36.371
Wow. You are making some really
great life choices right now.

12:36.420 --> 12:38.217
Yeah, well,
it's called a decision.

12:38.250 --> 12:41.185
You're just mad 'cause
I can make them, you can't.

12:41.220 --> 12:42.482
How's this for a decision?

12:42.520 --> 12:44.954
You need to leave now.

12:44.990 --> 12:46.924
I have a dinner to go to.

12:51.970 --> 12:53.437
Enjoy the pot roast.

13:02.210 --> 13:03.939
( knocking on door)

13:10.120 --> 13:11.109
Spencen

13:11.150 --> 13:12.515
You ready?

13:12.550 --> 13:14.359
Sure.

13:21.330 --> 13:22.456
Wow.

13:22.500 --> 13:24.889
Wow what?

13:24.930 --> 13:26.898
Nothing. I just--

13:26.940 --> 13:31.866
Wow, I forgot how enthusiastic
you were about watching things.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.209
Have you heard from Aria?

13:36.240 --> 13:38.049
Yeah, I just talked to her.

13:38.080 --> 13:39.149
You should have waited.

13:39.180 --> 13:41.569
I can talk to Eddie myself
once the police finish.

13:41.620 --> 13:43.918
Look, in my experience
with Eddie Lamb

13:43.950 --> 13:45.383
he's much less likely
to talk to you

13:45.420 --> 13:46.489
after the police leave.

13:46.520 --> 13:48.112
He wants us_
to know something.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.185
He left a picture
on my doorstep.

13:50.230 --> 13:51.458
Yeah, because
he's a good guy,

13:51.490 --> 13:53.549
but he's really big
on self-preservation.

13:56.260 --> 13:57.591
Aria will be fine.

13:57.630 --> 13:59.120
Okay?

13:59.170 --> 14:01.593
She told me not to let you
do any heavy lifting.

14:01.640 --> 14:03.938
Hmm.

14:03.970 --> 14:05.062
Did you park downstairs?

14:05.110 --> 14:06.975
Around the corner.

14:07.010 --> 14:09.069
Good.

14:09.110 --> 14:11.601
I hope your friend's shed
has a lot of room.

14:11.650 --> 14:14.346
It's a little bit
more than Aria let on.

14:17.250 --> 14:22.608
Actually, would you let me
borrow one of those cameras?

14:25.230 --> 14:27.994
There's just somebody
that I want to keep my eye on.

14:31.530 --> 14:32.565
No problem.

14:36.440 --> 14:38.169
( indistinct chatter )

14:49.550 --> 14:50.949
You're a little out
of your neighborhood.

14:50.990 --> 14:53.288
Sometimes I just
like to walk.

14:54.390 --> 14:56.358
( sighs )
Pretty awful, isn't it,

14:56.390 --> 15:00.326
how things change
so quickly in this town?

15:00.360 --> 15:01.952
Somebody's your girlfriend,
then they're not.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.661
One day there's a house
and the next day...

15:05.970 --> 15:07.267
it's gone.

15:07.300 --> 15:08.562
Poof

15:10.270 --> 15:14.377
If you or one of your goon squad
played that trick on Paige...

15:14.410 --> 15:19.074
You can call me a lot of names,
but don't call me an amateur.

15:19.110 --> 15:20.145
A dead rat?

15:20.180 --> 15:21.169
Really?

15:23.090 --> 15:24.910
Give my love to Alison.

15:31.090 --> 15:32.921
EZRA: It's like I said.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.924
Thank you for showing up
on that roof.

15:41.470 --> 15:43.131
It's turning
into my greatest hit.

15:43.170 --> 15:44.432
It was pretty impressive.

15:49.480 --> 15:50.970
All those boxes...

15:52.450 --> 15:54.748
all those words,
and it wasn't even the book

15:54.780 --> 15:56.008
I wanted to write.

15:57.650 --> 15:59.083
What did you want
to write about?

16:01.520 --> 16:03.351
My family.

16:03.390 --> 16:04.527
My brother and me.

16:04.560 --> 16:07.256
What happened when my
parents divorced,

16:07.300 --> 16:08.722
and my mother and father

16:08.760 --> 16:11.160
changed from who we thought
they were to

16:11.200 --> 16:12.599
who they really are.

16:13.770 --> 16:15.089
And I was gonna
figure it out

16:15.140 --> 16:16.698
all on paper, but...

16:17.810 --> 16:19.038
I couldn't.

16:20.380 --> 16:23.702
Yeah, well,
families can be hard.

16:26.710 --> 16:27.847
( sighs )

16:27.880 --> 16:30.087
So I went with a mystery
that I thought I could solve.

16:30.120 --> 16:32.008
And not only did
I not solve it,

16:32.050 --> 16:33.688
I, um...

16:35.790 --> 16:37.189
I probably made it worse.

16:39.060 --> 16:40.129
I know that feeling.

16:42.660 --> 16:44.491
The camera is
for my Sister.

16:44.530 --> 16:46.395
She's connected
to all of this.

16:47.440 --> 16:48.464
I just have
to figure out how.

16:50.540 --> 16:53.077
Maybe we should put down
the puzzles and walk away.

16:55.140 --> 16:57.108
Now, well, when you
figure out how to do that,

16:57.150 --> 16:58.174
you give me a call, okay?

17:00.820 --> 17:02.139
You'll be the first one.

17:14.860 --> 17:16.054
( gasps )

17:17.700 --> 17:21.090
Rhonda, what are you
doing in here?

17:21.140 --> 17:22.129
That doesn't belong to you.

17:22.170 --> 17:23.535
You ripped that
out of my book.

17:23.570 --> 17:24.559
Where is it?

17:25.810 --> 17:26.560
Rhonda, I don't...

17:26.610 --> 17:28.578
She gave these to me,
not to you!

17:30.810 --> 17:32.402
Who gave them to you?
Bethany?

17:32.450 --> 17:33.769
You know what they do
to thieves?

17:33.820 --> 17:36.038
They cut off their hands.

17:37.320 --> 17:39.538
What you gonna do, little girl,
when you've got no hands?

17:52.530 --> 17:53.838
Why did Bethany
give that to you?

17:53.870 --> 17:56.293
What are you trying to say?
You think I'm a thief?

17:56.340 --> 17:57.364
You're the thief!

17:57.410 --> 17:58.809
No.
Hey.

17:58.840 --> 17:59.659
What's going on in here?

18:02.140 --> 18:03.471
What do you think
Aria stole from you?

18:06.350 --> 18:07.772
Rhonda, I asked
you a question.

18:09.220 --> 18:11.108
I need to take
my shower now.

18:50.330 --> 18:51.456
I got your text.

18:51.490 --> 18:52.923
Cramps? Really?

18:52.960 --> 18:54.655
Sneak up much?

18:54.700 --> 18:58.192
Aria's stuck at Radley,
Spencer bailed on me.

18:58.230 --> 19:00.539
I mean, it can't just be Ali,
my mom and me.

19:01.840 --> 19:03.535
When did your mom
start drinking beer?

19:03.570 --> 19:05.538
She washes her hair with it.

19:05.570 --> 19:06.798
Look, I kind of have a headache.

19:06.840 --> 19:08.899
Okay, you can have your
headache in two weeks

19:08.940 --> 19:10.134
to go with your cramps.

19:11.550 --> 19:12.346
I don't know.

19:12.380 --> 19:14.917
Hanna, my mom
is making pop-overs.

19:14.950 --> 19:16.269
You know what that means.

19:16.320 --> 19:18.641
Look, I've hit my Ali limit
for one day.

19:18.690 --> 19:19.839
Every minute with her

19:19.890 --> 19:21.687
just sucks so much
energy out of you.

19:21.720 --> 19:23.426
Yeah, well, she's really
nervous about all this.

19:23.460 --> 19:25.382
I mean, the cops have been
breathing down her neck.

19:25.430 --> 19:27.694
It's not the cops, Em,
it's your mom.

19:27.730 --> 19:28.822
Maybe she could use
some practice

19:28.860 --> 19:30.191
getting her story straight.

19:30.230 --> 19:31.424
We all could.

19:31.470 --> 19:32.619
Yeah, that's why
you need to be there.

19:33.700 --> 19:34.894
Em, what's going on
with you two?

19:36.300 --> 19:37.369
I don't know. It's--

19:38.970 --> 19:41.302
Ali's just been really needy.

19:44.010 --> 19:45.500
( sighs ) Fine.

19:45.550 --> 19:46.847
I'll get some shoes.

19:46.880 --> 19:47.812
Okay.

19:49.450 --> 19:51.418
And brush your hair.

19:51.450 --> 19:52.986
10 minutes, my house.

19:53.020 --> 19:54.487
Thanks.

20:06.870 --> 20:08.189
( indistinct chatter )

20:33.500 --> 20:35.798
RHONDA: Who told her she
could have that shower stall?

20:35.830 --> 20:38.390
That's my shower stall!

20:38.430 --> 20:40.739
Everybody around here's
taking all my stuff!

20:40.770 --> 20:41.759
Everybody!

21:11.800 --> 21:14.735
( laughing )

21:14.770 --> 21:16.533
Mrs. Horowitz means well.

21:16.570 --> 21:18.868
I really shouldn't laugh.

21:18.910 --> 21:20.901
Oh, no.
Seriously, please laugh.

21:20.940 --> 21:22.578
I need as much laughter
as I can get.

21:22.610 --> 21:24.749
Hey, Hanna.

21:24.780 --> 21:26.577
Hey, Mrs. Fields.

21:26.610 --> 21:27.577
Sorry, I'm late.

21:27.620 --> 21:28.769
No worries.

21:28.820 --> 21:29.570
We were just getting ready
to bring things to the table.

21:29.620 --> 21:30.780
Do you want something
to drink?

21:30.820 --> 21:31.787
Water is fine.

21:31.820 --> 21:33.754
Oh, there you go.

21:33.790 --> 21:34.950
Em, you want to
give me a hand?

21:34.990 --> 21:36.059
Sure.

21:43.600 --> 21:45.864
Hey, did you talk
to Caleb?

21:47.370 --> 21:48.792
He's not gonna
make any trouble.

21:48.840 --> 21:52.958
A boy like that can make trouble
without even trying.

21:53.010 --> 21:54.705
Well, I trust him.

21:54.740 --> 21:55.729
I don't.

21:55.780 --> 21:58.101
Now would be a really bad time
to make a mistake.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.947
Caleb is not a mistake.

21:59.980 --> 22:02.574
He is the most un-mistake thing
in my life.

22:02.620 --> 22:04.417
You have to keep
a clear head, Hanna.

22:04.450 --> 22:06.486
It's hard to do that
when you're kissing somebody.

22:06.520 --> 22:07.885
So what do you want me to do?

22:07.920 --> 22:08.716
And keep it simple

22:08.760 --> 22:10.682
because you know
I'm not very smart.

22:10.730 --> 22:12.357
I'm just saying.

22:12.390 --> 22:13.493
He came back to town,

22:13.530 --> 22:14.952
you were still
in a relationship.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.969
Maybe you should just cool it
a little bit,

22:18.000 --> 22:19.865
make sure that you're doing
the right thing...

22:19.900 --> 22:21.936
for everybody.

22:22.940 --> 22:24.908
Are you telling me
not to see Caleb?

22:26.910 --> 22:28.798
MRS. FIELDS:
Who wants a pop-over?

22:28.840 --> 22:29.829
Save one for me.

23:02.140 --> 23:03.368
Long day?

23:05.180 --> 23:06.807
Yeah.

23:06.850 --> 23:07.612
I'm actually really late

23:07.650 --> 23:09.072
to a friend's house
though,so".

23:09.120 --> 23:11.884
Volunteers don't usually
stay this late.

23:11.920 --> 23:14.855
Radley can be
a little overwhelming.

23:15.860 --> 23:17.111
Well, it's only
my first day.

23:17.160 --> 23:18.855
I'll catch on.

23:26.670 --> 23:28.695
What are you looking for?

23:28.740 --> 23:31.004
Um, I'm sorry.

23:31.040 --> 23:32.507
I'm late.
I have to go.

23:32.540 --> 23:33.529
( car beeping )

23:37.180 --> 23:39.842
( engine rewing )

23:42.150 --> 23:45.142
( phone ringing )

23:47.890 --> 23:50.154
Is this Ezra Fitz?

23:50.190 --> 23:54.024
So they gave us a deal
on the replacement windows.

23:54.060 --> 23:56.528
It's the second set of widows
we bought this year.

23:56.560 --> 23:59.028
A! Simon said
it was a "bad luck" discount.

23:59.070 --> 24:00.492
I could use one of them.

24:00.540 --> 24:01.996
I think we all could.

24:02.040 --> 24:03.132
If you ask me,

24:03.170 --> 24:04.831
I think
people make their own luck.

24:04.870 --> 24:07.873
Sometimes things happen
that aren't anybody's fault.

24:07.910 --> 24:12.643
Yeah, like, I don't know,
say like a meteor falls

24:12.680 --> 24:14.944
and hits your car,
but the walking around stuff,

24:14.980 --> 24:17.813
that's usually
somebody else's fault.

24:17.850 --> 24:19.044
Right, Ali?

24:19.090 --> 24:21.615
I think
what Hanna means is--

24:21.660 --> 24:23.013
No, Hanna knows
what Hanna means.

24:26.090 --> 24:28.229
Maybe you're right, Han.

24:28.260 --> 24:31.161
Maybe we do set ourselves up
for bad things.

24:31.200 --> 24:33.896
We don't mean to,
but we do.

24:35.670 --> 24:37.661
I mean
what happened to me...

24:39.070 --> 24:41.675
there were times in the dark
where I would just think...

24:42.680 --> 24:44.705
"What did I do to anyone

24:44.750 --> 24:46.968
that was so bad
to deserve this?"

24:47.010 --> 24:48.978
You can't blame yourself
for what happened.

24:49.020 --> 24:50.840
Sure, in the light,

24:50.890 --> 24:52.846
in clean clothes
and hot plate of food,

24:52.890 --> 24:54.983
that makes sense.

24:55.020 --> 24:57.580
But when you're by yourself,

24:57.630 --> 24:59.621
you don't even know
what day it is.

25:01.300 --> 25:03.768
The only one around
to blame is yourself.

25:05.170 --> 25:07.866
I did.

25:07.900 --> 25:10.733
I was so ashamed
of what had happened to me.

25:10.770 --> 25:12.032
Don't say that.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.529
I was ashamed.

25:17.950 --> 25:20.612
And that's why I asked Emily
and Hanna and the others

25:20.650 --> 25:23.881
to not tell anyone
when I came back.

25:23.920 --> 25:25.911
And they didn't.

25:25.950 --> 25:27.918
And that must have been
so hard for them.

25:33.330 --> 25:36.891
You_hav_e some _
very speCIal friends, Alison.

25:36.930 --> 25:38.659
I know.

25:48.910 --> 25:51.071
You're the special one,
Ali.

25:52.750 --> 25:56.174
There is no one
in the entire world like you.

25:59.950 --> 26:01.087
Cheers.

26:08.900 --> 26:11.323
( coughing )

26:11.370 --> 26:12.769
Are you all right?

26:14.170 --> 26:15.967
Yeah, I'm fine.

26:18.910 --> 26:20.002
Can I help you clear?

26:20.040 --> 26:21.871
Please.

26:21.910 --> 26:23.309
Great.

26:44.070 --> 26:45.025
Hanna.

26:45.070 --> 26:46.162
What?

26:46.200 --> 26:48.395
I had to have something
to wash down all the baloney

26:48.440 --> 26:49.930
we had with dinner.

26:59.980 --> 27:01.277
Look, I know that
it was my idea,

27:01.320 --> 27:02.969
but you really cannot go back
to Radley.

27:03.020 --> 27:03.987
I have to.

27:04.020 --> 27:06.318
Look, maybe Rhonda knows
who visited Bethany,

27:06.350 --> 27:08.056
who Bethany's friends were.

27:08.090 --> 27:10.684
The more I find out, the closer
we are to exposing "A."

27:11.690 --> 27:13.021
Let me see that drawing.

27:16.930 --> 27:18.989
This was the last thing
that Bethany drew.

27:19.030 --> 27:21.794
She must have left Radley
after this.

27:21.840 --> 27:23.239
Yeah, but did
she leave hours after?

27:23.270 --> 27:24.828
Weeks?
Days?

27:24.870 --> 27:27.771
And why did she end up
at the DiLaurentis' house?

27:27.810 --> 27:30.028
This early stuff
is so normal.

27:30.080 --> 27:32.298
It's just what you draw
in art class.

27:33.950 --> 27:36.748
So how did it go today
with Ezra?

27:36.780 --> 27:38.748
It was fine.

27:38.790 --> 27:42.180
You didn't say anything,
did you, about...

27:42.220 --> 27:46.020
Aria, why would I slip you
into a conversation?

27:46.060 --> 27:47.994
You guys have done
enough slipping on your own.

27:55.800 --> 27:56.789
Wow.

28:03.440 --> 28:05.044
Wait, that looks like
a Chagall,

28:05.080 --> 28:07.878
the woman flying
like that.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.808
She's not flying.

28:10.920 --> 28:12.478
She's falling.

28:12.520 --> 28:13.782
Look, look at the vines.

28:13.820 --> 28:15.287
Look at the bars
on the window.

28:15.320 --> 28:17.459
Someone falling at Radley?

28:19.490 --> 28:20.889
Toby's mother?

28:20.930 --> 28:22.056
You think that
Bethany saw that?

28:22.100 --> 28:24.967
Well, saw it
or heard about it.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.060
Wait, you think that Bethany
was the "fragile patient"

28:28.100 --> 28:30.068
that was on the roof
with Toby's mother that night?

28:30.100 --> 28:32.807
Who else knew
Bethany at Radley?

28:36.110 --> 28:37.077
That's Mrs. DiLaurentis,
isn't it?

28:37.110 --> 28:38.941
Yeah.

28:38.980 --> 28:39.947
Mrs. D was on the board.

28:39.980 --> 28:41.914
She was part of the cover-up.

28:41.950 --> 28:42.939
So Bethany left Radley

28:42.980 --> 28:45.778
and then she went looking
for Mrs. DiLaurentis.

28:45.820 --> 28:48.948
And found someone waiting
for her with a shovel.

28:48.990 --> 28:50.924
Maybe that person was "A."

28:52.330 --> 28:53.752
I have to show this
to Toby.

28:53.800 --> 28:54.789
Okay.
Well, take a picture.

28:55.730 --> 28:57.220
I've got to get this back
under the mattress

28:57.260 --> 28:58.898
before Big Rhonda
finds out it's missing.

28:58.930 --> 29:01.967
She really, really doesn't like
people touching her stuff.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.137
Okay.

29:11.080 --> 29:12.206
What are you doing?

29:12.250 --> 29:13.808
Taking your keys.

29:13.850 --> 29:15.272
You're leaving but I don't think
you should drive.

29:15.320 --> 29:16.969
Emily, I thought
I was helping you--

29:17.020 --> 29:18.419
Yeah, I needed help,
but you weren't helping.

29:20.350 --> 29:21.351
Here.

29:21.390 --> 29:23.153
I'll tell them
that your mom called

29:23.190 --> 29:24.452
and you had to leave.

29:27.060 --> 29:29.358
You know, all that stuff about
her blaming herself?

29:29.400 --> 29:31.061
Your mom didn't buy it.

29:31.100 --> 29:32.192
I was looking at her.

29:44.910 --> 29:45.979
SYDNEY: Hanna, right?

29:47.280 --> 29:48.474
It's Sydney.

29:48.520 --> 29:50.044
Emily's friend
from swim team?

29:50.080 --> 29:51.286
Oh, hey.

29:54.920 --> 29:57.184
Having a hot date
with my homework.

29:57.220 --> 29:59.051
You on your way out or...

29:59.090 --> 30:01.558
No, Ijust had dinner
over at Em's.

30:03.060 --> 30:05.119
Oh, must have been
some dinner.

30:06.430 --> 30:08.034
Do you want to sit
for a minute?

30:09.370 --> 30:11.031
No, I was just
gonna head home.

30:11.070 --> 30:12.537
Not like that, you're not.

30:12.570 --> 30:13.901
Wait it out with me.

30:13.940 --> 30:16.079
We'll split a panini.

30:17.950 --> 30:21.113
Okay, I guess I probably
could sober up a little bit.

30:21.150 --> 30:23.175
I've already yacked on
my mom once this week.

30:23.220 --> 30:27.111
Um, can I have a soy latte
with caramel

30:27.150 --> 30:28.117
and whipped cream?

30:28.160 --> 30:29.957
You?
Same.

30:29.990 --> 30:32.481
Did she eat anything?

30:32.530 --> 30:34.919
Just some salad.

30:34.960 --> 30:36.951
( sighs )

30:37.000 --> 30:38.865
I tried to coax her.

30:38.900 --> 30:40.527
She just doesn't have
any appetite.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.934
Because she knows
whose Side you're on.

30:43.970 --> 30:46.006
I'm not on anyone's side.

30:46.040 --> 30:48.179
Really? Then who is staying
in your apartment?

30:48.210 --> 30:50.075
What was I supposed to do?

30:50.110 --> 30:52.305
Send Dad to a hotel
because you're mad at him?

30:52.350 --> 30:54.318
I'm not mad at him!
Okay?

30:54.350 --> 30:56.568
I'm just trying to figure out
who he is

30:56.620 --> 30:58.918
and who you are and what Mom
and I are up against.

30:58.950 --> 31:00.508
Now who's taking sides?

31:06.130 --> 31:08.098
This isn't helping
anything,

31:08.130 --> 31:10.098
you and I
going at each other.

31:10.130 --> 31:12.223
It's bad enough
between Mom and Dad.

31:17.140 --> 31:19.108
Parents--

31:19.140 --> 31:22.598
Parents are not supposed
to stop loving each other.

31:22.640 --> 31:24.608
This is not about love.

31:24.650 --> 31:26.902
If it were about love,

31:26.950 --> 31:29.248
then there wouldn't be
bodies buried in baclqards

31:29.280 --> 31:30.872
up and down the street.

31:32.090 --> 31:33.978
This is about lies

31:34.020 --> 31:35.612
and whispered conversations

31:35.660 --> 31:37.958
that stop when somebody
walks into a room.

31:41.030 --> 31:42.657
It's about Alison.

31:44.130 --> 31:45.529
What really happened
to her...

31:48.300 --> 31:49.528
and what happened
to that poor girl

31:49.570 --> 31:51.504
who ended up
in the ground.

32:00.010 --> 32:01.272
You're right.

32:03.080 --> 32:04.183
Iam?

32:07.350 --> 32:11.081
But it's still about love,
Spencen

32:11.130 --> 32:16.090
Sometimes people do things
they can't explain...

32:17.060 --> 32:19.392
things that they regret.

32:20.570 --> 32:23.061
But it is
still about love.

32:30.540 --> 32:34.044
( door opens and closes )

32:34.080 --> 32:35.342
( beeping )

32:55.800 --> 32:59.031
Melted cheese
is the best booze-blocker.

32:59.070 --> 33:00.002
You can say that
again.

33:00.040 --> 33:02.076
No. ( chuckles )

33:02.110 --> 33:03.179
I need a napkin.

33:04.650 --> 33:06.504
I think
there's one under here.

33:10.150 --> 33:11.742
Yeah, here you go.

33:11.790 --> 33:13.041
Thank you.

33:14.260 --> 33:15.488
I was just reading about that.

33:15.520 --> 33:16.487
So scary.

33:16.520 --> 33:18.056
Apparently
they lost everything.

33:19.430 --> 33:22.456
Yeah. We were at Em's house
when it happened.

33:23.830 --> 33:25.559
Did you know
whoever lived there?

33:26.670 --> 33:27.489
Yeah.

33:27.530 --> 33:29.794
Yeah, our friend Toby
grew up there

33:29.840 --> 33:32.308
with his stepsister
Jenna.

33:32.340 --> 33:34.137
Her name
just keeps popping up.

33:34.180 --> 33:36.239
People seem to have
a lot of beef with her.

33:36.280 --> 33:38.748
Well, she definitely
has her own chuck to grind.

33:38.780 --> 33:40.509
And somebody thought

33:40.550 --> 33:42.472
her house would make
a good barbecue pit?

33:42.520 --> 33:46.388
( laughs ) God, I would love
to rake her over the coals.

33:47.820 --> 33:49.287
Actually,
that is not true.

33:51.290 --> 33:52.518
I just think
that the whole time

33:52.560 --> 33:54.790
we were fighting
someone else's battle.

33:54.830 --> 33:57.128
Have you ever wanted
to make up with Jenna?

33:57.160 --> 33:57.956
Quit fighting?

33:59.830 --> 34:02.139
I mean, there was
always a possibility

34:02.170 --> 34:05.333
that we could with Shana--
Jenna.

34:06.770 --> 34:10.536
But after everything that
happened in New York,

34:10.580 --> 34:13.048
it was just too late.

34:14.550 --> 34:16.438
Sounds juicy.

34:19.720 --> 34:21.756
Last chance
for chocolate mousse.

34:21.790 --> 34:24.281
Uh, I'm good.
Thank you.

34:24.330 --> 34:26.389
You know, I'm sorry
that Hanna had to leave,

34:26.430 --> 34:29.058
but it was really nice
having that time with Alison.

34:30.660 --> 34:33.322
Why was it so important
to have Ali here tonight?

34:36.600 --> 34:39.307
I wanted to see
the two of you together.

34:40.610 --> 34:41.577
You know,
hindsight's 20-20

34:41.610 --> 34:45.341
and I just realized that
maybe you thought of her

34:45.380 --> 34:48.178
as more than just a friend
before she left.

34:50.150 --> 34:50.775
I did.

34:55.360 --> 34:57.885
A lot changed
while she was gone.

34:57.920 --> 34:59.353
How do you feel now?

35:01.800 --> 35:03.825
I'm working on it.

35:06.470 --> 35:09.359
You know, Emily,
I still talk to people,

35:09.400 --> 35:11.800
you know,
people in the police force.

35:12.770 --> 35:14.135
And that story
that Alison told you

35:14.180 --> 35:15.704
about being kidnapped...

35:17.780 --> 35:19.839
it's got some problems.

35:22.520 --> 35:26.684
Look, honey, I can't tell you
how your heart should work.

35:26.720 --> 35:30.178
But just remember that you may
have saved Alison once...

35:32.490 --> 35:34.754
you don't have
to keep saving her.

35:47.670 --> 35:49.570
Hey, if you want
we can take these to go

35:49.610 --> 35:51.271
and I can drop you off
at home.

35:51.310 --> 35:52.675
Yeah, yeah.

35:52.710 --> 35:53.802
Sure.

35:56.450 --> 35:59.385
Um, actually
I think I might walk home.

35:59.420 --> 36:01.786
The air,
it will probably help.

36:01.820 --> 36:02.855
You sure?
Yeah.

36:02.890 --> 36:04.187
Okay.

36:04.230 --> 36:05.185
I'll see you at school.

36:05.230 --> 36:06.686
Thanks.

36:06.730 --> 36:07.719
Bye.

36:08.960 --> 36:12.669
* And you heard
I was trouble *

36:12.700 --> 36:15.931
* But your name is a wave
washing over me *

36:15.970 --> 36:18.905
* No games,
just a slave to you totally *

36:18.940 --> 36:22.398
* 'Cause I don't care _what
they say about you Virgo *

36:22.440 --> 36:24.806
* And you don't care
what they say about me Virgo *

36:24.850 --> 36:26.306
Did you blow off
your dinner?

36:27.710 --> 36:29.678
I got kicked out.

36:29.720 --> 36:31.278
Seriously?

36:31.320 --> 36:32.947
What happened?

36:32.990 --> 36:35.458
Did Emily's mom catch you
spitting into your napkin?

36:44.600 --> 36:45.726
Look, Hanna, I probably

36:45.770 --> 36:47.795
shouldn't be giving advice
about friends.

36:47.830 --> 36:50.333
You handle Alison
however--

36:50.370 --> 36:52.201
I don't want to
talk about Alison.

36:53.010 --> 36:54.978
I want to talk about us.

36:57.740 --> 36:58.843
What do you mean?

37:01.350 --> 37:03.773
I may be having a hard time
making decisions lately,

37:03.820 --> 37:06.345
but so have you.

37:08.890 --> 37:11.927
And when it comes to me...

37:11.960 --> 37:14.428
you've been on the fence
ever since you got back.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.264
Look, we've talked
about this.

37:18.300 --> 37:19.267
You and Travis--

37:19.300 --> 37:20.858
There is no_
"me and Tram."

37:20.900 --> 37:22.868
Not when you're back here.

37:27.040 --> 37:28.701
What do you want?

37:32.950 --> 37:34.577
I don't know.

37:36.320 --> 37:37.947
The time that I spent away
from here,

37:37.980 --> 37:40.915
it made me question a lot.

37:42.760 --> 37:43.909
I'm not the same person.

37:43.960 --> 37:48.294
I learned stuff about my family
and me...

37:49.700 --> 37:50.849
and the world.

37:55.570 --> 37:56.764
When I look
around this room

37:56.800 --> 37:59.337
I don't see the same stuff
that I used to.

38:03.880 --> 38:05.370
Do you see me?

38:07.850 --> 38:08.976
Of course.

38:11.920 --> 38:15.515
Then why don't
we just start there?

38:20.890 --> 38:24.769
* So pull me down
if you want to *

38:24.800 --> 38:27.963
* And I hope
that you want to *

38:28.000 --> 38:33.666
* 'Cause I want to be
your man *

38:33.710 --> 38:36.577
* And_I want to
say it loud *

38:36.610 --> 38:39.875
* You can show me
where trouble goes *

38:39.910 --> 38:43.118
* Tell me secrets
only trouble knows *

38:43.150 --> 38:46.608
* 'Cause you want to be
my girl *

39:11.880 --> 39:13.745
( beeping )

39:44.180 --> 39:48.048
I heard what happened to you
in the locker room.

39:49.520 --> 39:51.010
I should have
called you sooner.

39:52.920 --> 39:56.686
I'm sorry if this was because
of what you told me about Mona

39:56.720 --> 39:58.927
which I think it was.

40:00.190 --> 40:02.499
I'm sorry I put you
in the middle of all this.

40:03.860 --> 40:05.999
If you need anything,
please call me.

40:07.600 --> 40:11.468
Listen, even if you don't need
anything, just call.

40:11.510 --> 40:12.659
Please.

40:13.840 --> 40:15.068
Okay, I love--

40:16.980 --> 40:19.448
I'd love to hear from you.

40:19.480 --> 40:21.710
I hope you're all right.

40:21.750 --> 40:22.978
Bye.

40:26.190 --> 40:27.418
( cell phone beeps )

40:30.960 --> 40:32.655
I'm walking out my door
right now, Spencer.

40:34.800 --> 40:36.825
No,
I haven't talked to Hanna.

40:36.860 --> 40:37.895
Yeah.
Okay, I'm on my way.

40:37.930 --> 40:38.965
Bye.

40:41.740 --> 40:42.638
Ezra?

40:42.670 --> 40:46.037
You saw Eddie _
as you were leavmg, right?

40:47.070 --> 40:49.004
Yeah. In the parking lot.
Why?

40:50.680 --> 40:51.977
He called _
to set up a meeting.

40:52.010 --> 40:54.046
I waited for over an hour.

40:54.080 --> 40:55.445
Eddie never showed up.

40:58.950 --> 41:00.087
EMILY: That is not
how she was dressed

41:00.120 --> 41:02.111
when she left.

41:02.160 --> 41:03.149
Where is Ali going?

41:03.190 --> 41:04.828
Did you see her
come back?

41:04.860 --> 41:06.851
No.
Not yet.

41:06.890 --> 41:08.755
Well, how was she acting when
she left your house tonight?

41:08.800 --> 41:10.950
Hard to tell,
she left pretty early.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.127
Might have been
Hanna's fault though.

41:13.170 --> 41:14.125
She was drinking.

41:14.170 --> 41:15.694
In front of your mom?

41:15.740 --> 41:16.934
Yeah,
I had to kick her out.

41:16.970 --> 41:17.959
She knows I'm mad.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.501
She might not even show up.

41:19.540 --> 41:20.905
She has to show up.

41:20.940 --> 41:22.908
We have to figure out
what Ali's up to.

41:22.940 --> 41:26.000
( cell phones beeping )

41:31.650 --> 41:33.242
( door opens )

41:33.290 --> 41:34.609
Hey.

41:34.660 --> 41:36.059
Sorry, you guys,
I ran into Caleb

41:36.090 --> 41:38.581
and we had a few things
to talk about.

41:38.630 --> 41:39.483
What did I miss?

41:41.030 --> 41:42.156
Did you just get the text
that came in?

41:42.200 --> 41:43.258
It's from "A."

41:43.300 --> 41:44.665
No.

41:44.700 --> 41:45.667
Are you sure?

41:45.700 --> 41:46.894
Check your phone.

41:50.100 --> 41:52.204
I don't know
what text you're talking about.

41:57.680 --> 41:59.841
"New York, New York,
it's a hell of a town.

41:59.880 --> 42:02.747
Ali's keeping secrets.

42:02.780 --> 42:05.647
Maybe that's
because of Hanna's big mouth."

42:07.790 --> 42:09.519
Care to fill us in?
