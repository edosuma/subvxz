00:26.726 --> 00:28.751
Care to try
our new science water?

00:29.295 --> 00:31.663
The label is
all in lowercase.

00:32.999 --> 00:35.834
It's like drinking
E.E. Cummings!

00:35.902 --> 00:39.237
And each of our flavors
is named after a real word!

00:39.305 --> 00:41.920
Nourish.
Vitality.

00:42.675 --> 00:45.189
Purple.
Potato-lime.

00:45.778 --> 00:47.512
I love the '90s.

00:47.580 --> 00:48.988
New car smell.

00:49.672 --> 00:53.554
Excuse me, I'm feeling
a little over-hydrated.

00:53.589 --> 00:54.563
That's normal.

00:54.599 --> 00:57.197
It just means
your bladder's full of science.

00:57.232 --> 01:00.700
Now, if you'll excuse me,
our company just went bankrupt.

01:08.968 --> 01:10.885
Gotta find
a place to tinkle!

01:11.004 --> 01:12.963
Language!

01:16.237 --> 01:17.863
Schools have bathrooms!

01:17.898 --> 01:18.617
And I'm a woman,

01:18.638 --> 01:21.227
so my going in unattended
won't cause a panic.

01:23.850 --> 01:26.518
- Hey, Mrs. Simpson.
- Janey.

01:28.087 --> 01:29.885
Ooh,
that's Bart's class.

01:32.024 --> 01:34.070
Lousy teachers.

01:35.695 --> 01:37.894
Lousy hangover.

01:37.964 --> 01:40.609
This school has
really gone downhill.

01:43.202 --> 01:45.937
That's an
awfully crowded classroom.

01:51.124 --> 01:53.100
Three, two, one.

01:53.151 --> 01:55.666
Okay, children,
I've just been granted tenure.

01:55.748 --> 01:58.329
So I'm gonna sit back and
let Ralph teach for a while.

02:03.289 --> 02:05.991
Class, in what year was
one plus one?

02:07.360 --> 02:09.955
The answer is:
"The amazing Ralph"!

02:11.664 --> 02:15.166
The only person getting an education
here today was me!

02:15.234 --> 02:16.835
In how bad it is!

02:16.903 --> 02:19.028
Mrs. Simpson,
let me pour you a drink.

02:19.228 --> 02:21.097
Scotch? Vodka?
Gin?

02:21.132 --> 02:22.249
I've got
everything you want.

02:22.283 --> 02:24.743
I want my kids
in a decent school!

02:24.810 --> 02:27.079
Hey, I want the "check engine"
 light on my dashboard

02:27.146 --> 02:28.864
to shut off,
but that ain't gonna happen.

02:31.517 --> 02:35.417
And because of cutbacks,
they were combining Math with P.E.

02:35.488 --> 02:37.285
They were playing
dodge book!

02:37.320 --> 02:38.290
Look at this.

02:38.357 --> 02:40.659
Springfield Elementary's rating
is so low,

02:40.726 --> 02:42.632
it's more than
two standard deviations

02:42.667 --> 02:43.648
below the norm.

02:43.696 --> 02:45.931
Oh, I can't understand
that math reference,

02:45.998 --> 02:48.097
because I went to
Springfield Elementary!

02:48.167 --> 02:50.566
My cousin goes
to a much better school.

02:50.570 --> 02:52.203
He lives in Waverly Hills.

02:52.271 --> 02:54.706
Oh, their school system's
the best.

02:54.774 --> 02:58.012
Their auditorium and their gym
are two different rooms!

02:59.178 --> 03:01.279
We can't afford
to move to Waverly Hills!

03:01.347 --> 03:03.381
Their house prices have
commas in them.

03:03.449 --> 03:05.650
As it is, our lawn is just
green-painted cement.

03:09.855 --> 03:12.023
I just wish I could go
to a school like that--

03:12.091 --> 03:13.492
Even for one week.

03:13.559 --> 03:15.327
"'tis better to have
learned and lost,

03:15.394 --> 03:17.314
than never to have
learned at all."

03:17.430 --> 03:19.690
What if we got
a small apartment there?

03:19.725 --> 03:20.832
We wouldn't have
to live in it,

03:20.900 --> 03:23.609
but we would have
a Waverly Hills address.

03:23.636 --> 03:25.237
Mom,
that's brilliant!

03:25.304 --> 03:28.266
We could go to a school where
special doesn't always mean bad!

03:28.274 --> 03:30.275
And where the teachers
don't have to moonlight

03:30.343 --> 03:31.585
as telemarketers.

03:31.744 --> 03:34.936
As you know,
the music of Air Supply is timeless.

03:34.947 --> 03:37.882
And now their 50 biggest hits
are on four CDs.

03:37.950 --> 03:38.619
Wait, wait, wait.

03:38.644 --> 03:40.667
You're putting us
in a new school?!

03:40.702 --> 03:42.062
What about my friends?

03:42.288 --> 03:44.456
Oh,
elementary school friends--

03:44.623 --> 03:46.588
Those are forever!

03:46.659 --> 03:50.269
You're always gonna be friends
with Milhouse.

03:50.270 --> 03:54.397
# Stand by me,
oh, stand by me #

03:54.398 --> 03:56.179
- # Oh, stand now #
- # Oh, stand now #

03:56.180 --> 03:57.718
<i>- # Stand by me #
- # Stand by me #</i>

03:57.853 --> 04:00.202
- # Stand by me #
- # Stand by me #

04:01.440 --> 04:02.474
I need to
rent an apartment

04:02.542 --> 04:04.005
in the worst part of
Waverly Hills--

04:04.010 --> 04:05.535
The crappier,
the better.

04:05.570 --> 04:06.705
Ah,
so cheap, eh?

04:06.740 --> 04:09.461
"Ahso sheepay"
to you.

04:12.418 --> 04:13.852
I can't afford
this place--

04:13.919 --> 04:15.092
It's way too fancy.

04:15.188 --> 04:17.987
Sometimes,
there's not a train going by.

04:19.125 --> 04:20.759
Four walls?

04:20.826 --> 04:22.627
Hmm,
I was thinking more

04:22.695 --> 04:25.119
of something in a
two or three.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.834
No windows,
no parking,

04:29.902 --> 04:31.223
and a man died here.

04:31.258 --> 04:32.237
<i>Play it cool,
Homer.</i>

04:32.305 --> 04:34.005
<i>Don't let her know
it's perfect.</i>

04:34.173 --> 04:36.076
Yeah, um...

04:36.175 --> 04:39.681
Well, I'm looking at
a lot of murder sites right now.

04:39.945 --> 04:40.712
Where's the bedroom?

04:40.780 --> 04:41.584
Right here.

04:42.014 --> 04:42.904
Hmm?

04:43.049 --> 04:45.070
Tempting.
Tempting.

04:45.105 --> 04:46.151
Where's the bathroom?

04:46.219 --> 04:48.775
In the Ethiopian restaurant
at the end of the block.

04:48.788 --> 04:49.554
I'll take it!

05:18.918 --> 05:20.952
Well,
welcome to Waverly Hills.

05:21.020 --> 05:23.189
Your children can start
school immediately.

05:23.224 --> 05:24.122
Thank you!

05:24.190 --> 05:26.024
Now you'll be getting
a random visit

05:26.092 --> 05:28.275
from the inspector,
sometime this month.

05:28.310 --> 05:28.960
The what?

05:29.028 --> 05:30.528
It's just a formality

05:30.596 --> 05:32.722
to make sure
you actually live here.

05:32.757 --> 05:33.965
Some people
use the address

05:34.033 --> 05:36.436
just so their kids
can go to our schools.

05:36.469 --> 05:38.018
Oh,
I can see them now

05:38.018 --> 05:40.638
with their bald heads and
their blue-haired wives.

05:40.706 --> 05:42.595
How I despise them.

05:42.630 --> 05:45.110
Yeah, well,
here's our inspector now.

05:48.486 --> 05:50.816
Call it, friendo.

05:51.317 --> 05:53.418
Heads. I mean, tails.
I mean, on its side.

05:56.837 --> 05:57.848
Well done.

05:58.090 --> 06:00.386
Now, let me
validate your parking.

06:02.728 --> 06:03.878
That's not enough.

06:04.808 --> 06:05.730
Thank you.

06:10.418 --> 06:11.848
Good night, Marge.

06:12.687 --> 06:14.856
It's so kind of you
to live there

06:14.891 --> 06:17.126
so our kids can go
to a better school.

06:17.161 --> 06:19.193
When do I get
to move back home?

06:19.228 --> 06:21.256
You just have to stay there
until that

06:21.271 --> 06:24.831
psychopathic school inspector
makes a surprise visit.

06:24.899 --> 06:26.741
You can come home
when the heat's off.

06:26.776 --> 06:27.783
The heat is off.

06:27.819 --> 06:29.985
The hissing from the radiator
is a snake.

06:31.172 --> 06:34.707
Please just stay there till
Bart graduates high school.

06:34.742 --> 06:38.064
Oh, that's another
20 or 30 years.

06:46.490 --> 06:47.921
<i>Where am I?</i>

06:50.991 --> 06:53.839
Wow, your first day
at the new school!

06:53.874 --> 06:55.264
Lisa, have fun!

06:55.299 --> 06:56.262
Bart, don't!

07:00.134 --> 07:01.401
Look at this place.

07:01.469 --> 07:03.435
It's everything
I've ever dreamed of.

07:03.470 --> 07:05.247
On-campus stables!

07:09.643 --> 07:11.661
<i>Field trips to Europe!</i>

07:13.239 --> 07:14.814
Oh, my God!

07:14.882 --> 07:17.166
Look what they serve
in the cafeteria!

07:19.175 --> 07:20.143
Welcome!

07:20.178 --> 07:22.613
I'm your new principal,
Dr. Bettelheim.

07:22.648 --> 07:24.287
Oh, a doctorate!

07:24.322 --> 07:25.158
Wait!

07:25.226 --> 07:26.688
Don't matriculate
those students!

07:26.723 --> 07:28.118
Principal Skinner?

07:28.153 --> 07:30.231
We need Lisa Simpson at
Springfield Elementary.

07:30.266 --> 07:31.397
She's our top student,

07:31.467 --> 07:34.164
<i>and</i> she writes the fun facts
in the morning announcements!

07:34.484 --> 07:35.959
Skinner!

07:36.362 --> 07:37.600
Bettelheim.

07:37.635 --> 07:38.772
Super-intendent Chalmers?!

07:38.807 --> 07:41.418
What are you doing at...
another school?!

07:41.453 --> 07:43.176
Seymour,
as super-intendent,

07:43.244 --> 07:45.845
I supervise every school
in the district.

07:45.913 --> 07:49.660
So...
You're overseeing other people?

07:50.050 --> 07:53.101
I'm sorry if you
misunderstood our arrangement.

07:53.136 --> 07:54.850
What am I supposed
to tell our children?

07:54.885 --> 07:56.055
They already know,

07:56.123 --> 07:57.883
and they're happy
for me.

08:04.207 --> 08:05.198
Hey, neighbor.

08:05.233 --> 08:06.232
Welcome to the jungle,

08:06.300 --> 08:08.836
also known as
Royal Waverly Apartments.

08:08.871 --> 08:10.557
Brought you
a housewarming present.

08:12.873 --> 08:14.676
Oh, that was great.

08:14.711 --> 08:16.272
You mind if
I use that at work?

08:16.307 --> 08:17.505
It's yours,
my friend.

08:17.540 --> 08:18.822
Hey,
are you into poker?

08:18.857 --> 08:21.281
Well, I love to play,
but I'm not very good.

08:21.348 --> 08:24.511
Also, I always forget to cash my chips
back in for money.

08:25.110 --> 08:28.224
This man-crush
just got bro-mantic!

08:28.259 --> 08:30.006
You make words
into dudes.

08:30.041 --> 08:30.890
Guy-five!

08:30.958 --> 08:31.691
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

08:36.433 --> 08:37.063
Hi, newbie!

08:37.131 --> 08:39.566
I'm Caitlin with a C,
this is Katelyn with a K,

08:39.633 --> 08:41.611
and this is Kate Lynn,
two words.

08:41.647 --> 08:42.524
I'm Lisa.

08:42.897 --> 08:43.922
One word.

08:43.957 --> 08:47.035
So, Lisa, what's your favorite
Alaska Nebraska song?

08:47.070 --> 08:48.639
Mine's
"Touch a Star".

08:48.676 --> 08:51.093
Mine's
"Make It Yours: The Star Song".

08:51.128 --> 08:53.193
Uh,
who's Alaska Nebraska?

08:53.228 --> 08:55.347
"Who's Alaska Nebraska?"

08:55.382 --> 08:57.467
Only the greatest
16-year-old

08:57.502 --> 08:59.385
singer-slash-actress
in the world!

08:59.453 --> 09:01.497
Do you even know
how lame you are?

09:01.532 --> 09:04.090
I should warn you:
By using the term "lame,"

09:04.158 --> 09:06.926
you're violating the
Americans With Disabilities Act.

09:06.994 --> 09:09.437
Ew!
That makes you even lamer!

09:16.356 --> 09:17.990
B-plus?!

09:18.025 --> 09:19.135
Nice work.

09:19.170 --> 09:20.506
But I always get A's.

09:20.574 --> 09:22.508
At my old school,
I got so many A's,

09:22.576 --> 09:24.949
the teachers didn't even
check my work.

09:24.984 --> 09:26.879
Maybe that's why
you got so many A's.

09:27.678 --> 09:30.194
<i>Oh, my God,
you've been challenged!</i>

09:30.229 --> 09:32.752
<i>Well, Lisa,
let's see how you respond.</i>

09:39.960 --> 09:42.562
Bart, at this school,
I'm not a brain,

09:42.630 --> 09:44.931
I'm not popular,
I'm not anything!

09:44.999 --> 09:46.399
Not to worry,
at this school,

09:46.467 --> 09:47.721
we've got a clean slate.

09:47.756 --> 09:50.419
In fact,
I'm establishing my cred right now.

09:51.672 --> 09:52.456
Gotcha!

09:53.542 --> 09:54.913
- Hey!
- Come on.

09:54.948 --> 09:56.405
Take this
as a warning, kids.

09:56.440 --> 09:58.811
Bart Simpson
is the ultimate bad boy.

09:58.879 --> 10:01.414
Befriend him and
you'll wind up just like him--

10:01.482 --> 10:04.766
A rebel who does what he wants,
when he wants.

10:04.801 --> 10:05.470
Wow.

10:05.505 --> 10:07.920
Come on, tough guy,
let's go.

10:09.456 --> 10:11.429
- He's so bad!
- He's so bad!

10:17.905 --> 10:19.966
Okay, I held up
my side of the bargain.

10:20.033 --> 10:22.569
Now you have to go to
Ralphie's birthday party.

10:22.604 --> 10:23.870
Eh,
a deal's a deal.

10:23.937 --> 10:26.297
And you'll stay
till we cut the cake.

10:26.332 --> 10:26.976
Fine.

10:27.022 --> 10:29.860
I want one gift bag now,
and one when the party's over.

10:29.895 --> 10:30.969
Fine.
You got it.

10:34.361 --> 10:36.272
You wanted a pow-wow,
Chief?

10:36.307 --> 10:38.762
I know you've been dealing drugs
at the high school.

10:38.797 --> 10:42.193
But I'll look the other way
if you come to Ralphie's party.

10:42.228 --> 10:44.591
I ain't gonna pin
no tail on no donkey.

10:44.626 --> 10:46.926
Look, just come to the party.
It's gonna be fun.

10:46.994 --> 10:48.466
Batman's
gonna be there.

10:48.501 --> 10:49.829
Ba-Ba-Ba-Batman?!

10:49.897 --> 10:52.417
I ain't messin'
with no caped crusader!

10:59.072 --> 11:00.990
I wonder
what he did.

11:00.991 --> 11:02.909
I heard he burned down
his old school.

11:02.977 --> 11:04.623
I heard
he killed a groundskeeper!

11:04.858 --> 11:07.045
Oh, my,
that's a bit rough.

11:11.652 --> 11:14.921
Now, to turn my sis
from loser to schmoozer.

11:17.928 --> 11:18.992
Hmm...

11:20.214 --> 11:21.437
¿qué pasa,
ladies?

11:21.472 --> 11:22.730
You're that bad boy.

11:22.765 --> 11:24.731
What do you want from us,
bad boy?

11:24.798 --> 11:28.270
Don't tell anyone,
but my sister Lisa is best friends

11:28.305 --> 11:29.602
with Alaska Nebraska.

11:29.670 --> 11:31.020
- Get out of here!
- No way!

11:31.105 --> 11:32.105
You so lie!

11:32.173 --> 11:34.660
She didn't even know who
Alaska Nebraska was.

11:34.695 --> 11:37.910
Duh! She said that because
she respects Alaska's privacy.

11:37.978 --> 11:39.345
Just as
I have no doubt

11:39.413 --> 11:42.418
you guys will respect
Lisa's privacy.

11:53.180 --> 11:55.379
We're approaching
bandwidth overload, sir.

11:55.414 --> 11:57.432
It's gossip
at Waverly Elementary.

11:57.467 --> 11:58.457
How juicy is it?

11:58.492 --> 11:59.820
The juiciest!

12:02.366 --> 12:03.177
Hi, Lisa!

12:03.270 --> 12:05.304
- Hi, Caitlin.
- She knows my name!

12:05.372 --> 12:07.173
No,
she knows my name!

12:07.241 --> 12:08.895
Bart,
your plan worked!

12:08.930 --> 12:10.284
My plan
was to lie.

12:10.319 --> 12:11.128
Lie like hell.

12:11.163 --> 12:12.212
And that's what I did.

12:13.147 --> 12:14.614
Well, well.

12:14.681 --> 12:15.866
Seems like someone

12:15.900 --> 12:17.874
forgot about
a previous engagement

12:17.909 --> 12:20.918
at the bowling alley
from 2:00 to 4:30.

12:57.458 --> 12:59.671
Get him
and string him up.

13:02.696 --> 13:04.564
"You have the right
to be delighted.

13:04.631 --> 13:07.867
If you do not have a gift,
one will be provided for you."

13:12.208 --> 13:13.070
<i>It's open.</i>

13:13.588 --> 13:15.461
Marge,
I'm glad you came.

13:15.496 --> 13:16.788
There's a kegger
down the hall.

13:16.788 --> 13:18.811
We can go as soon as
I desecrate this corpse.

13:20.695 --> 13:23.119
I'm sorry, Marge.
Where are my manners?

13:23.164 --> 13:26.371
Did you want to taunt my kill, also?
Press the X button.

13:26.568 --> 13:28.000
Ooh, I'm doing it!

13:34.910 --> 13:36.182
I'll get us
some brewskies.

13:37.545 --> 13:38.613
Cup, my lady?

13:38.635 --> 13:41.248
Or would you care to
funnel it down thy throat?

13:42.617 --> 13:45.918
- Definitely a cup.
- Foam wasn't spilt in a day.

13:46.655 --> 13:48.164
Dude,
your date is hot!

13:48.223 --> 13:51.506
- Does she have a sister?
- Two, actually. Twins.

13:51.593 --> 13:53.394
- Twins!
- Twins!

13:54.028 --> 13:58.799
I was an astronaut for a little bit.
So many rules.

14:03.139 --> 14:05.172
Your hair smells nice!

14:07.743 --> 14:11.439
- Listen, I got a place down the hall.
- Oh, let's go.

14:14.483 --> 14:17.025
So, were you two
in the same accident,

14:17.060 --> 14:18.473
or...
or what?

14:22.424 --> 14:26.038
We don't need a bed.
We're not gonna be sleeping.

14:29.615 --> 14:32.659
We're not the only ones
having a good time.

14:33.034 --> 14:35.473
What in God's name
was I thinking?!

14:36.938 --> 14:38.840
Maybe you could
come over again.

14:38.849 --> 14:41.504
I'll cook you my special
microwave burritos.

14:41.710 --> 14:45.983
I stop the oven when the middle
is still a little bit frozen.

14:46.114 --> 14:49.008
You know
what a girl likes, mister.

14:49.159 --> 14:51.048
So, can I see you again?

14:51.219 --> 14:55.294
How about you, me and
my wife have a two-way?

14:57.525 --> 14:58.379
Hi.

14:59.528 --> 15:02.018
Lisa, I regraded your paper
from the other day,

15:02.053 --> 15:03.141
and you got an A.

15:03.365 --> 15:03.958
Really?

15:04.188 --> 15:06.298
My kid's a huge
Alaska Nebraska fan.

15:06.368 --> 15:09.123
If she could somehow get an
autographed photo or T-shirt,

15:09.204 --> 15:11.671
that would be
A-plus in my book.

15:12.073 --> 15:13.540
Did you just
wink at me?

15:13.942 --> 15:16.113
Oh, look, there are
pumpkin stickers on the floor.

15:16.148 --> 15:18.339
They must have fallen off
your homework for next week,

15:18.380 --> 15:19.625
which you don't have
to hand in.

15:23.051 --> 15:25.350
I didn't think
I'd get a fresh start like this

15:25.391 --> 15:26.712
till junior high.

15:27.122 --> 15:29.078
L'école, c'est moi!
(It's me, the school!)

15:30.025 --> 15:31.959
Oui. C'est toi!
(Yes. It's you!)

15:32.027 --> 15:35.216
Even the Ralph of this school
speaks French!

15:35.251 --> 15:36.473
Au revoir!
(Thank you!)

15:40.168 --> 15:41.936
I love tapas!

15:41.971 --> 15:44.722
It's like appetizers for
a meal that never comes.

15:45.740 --> 15:48.161
Try the
<i>flan de leche de cabra</i>.

15:48.243 --> 15:50.861
Be sure to dig around
in the gunk.

15:53.815 --> 15:54.905
Homie!

15:55.350 --> 15:58.151
A key to
your apartment!

15:59.988 --> 16:02.156
And I've got
a present for you,

16:02.157 --> 16:06.000
but you'll have to wait till
we're back at the apartment.

16:06.127 --> 16:07.647
Why can't
I have it now?

16:07.696 --> 16:09.044
You got
your present here.

16:09.231 --> 16:10.731
Basic fairness
dictates...

16:13.168 --> 16:14.473
Caitlin, hi.

16:14.803 --> 16:17.163
Do a reading
at your bar mitzvah?

16:17.172 --> 16:19.047
A sheynam dank!
(Thank you very much!)

16:19.174 --> 16:21.329
Now my bar mitzvah
means something.

16:21.364 --> 16:22.777
By the way,
I was wondering,

16:22.844 --> 16:25.196
there's this Alaska Nebraska
concert this weekend,

16:25.247 --> 16:27.317
and the tickets
are all sold out.

16:27.352 --> 16:30.881
Well, if it's sold out,
even Alaska Nebraska's best friend

16:30.916 --> 16:32.386
couldn't do anything
about that.

16:33.655 --> 16:35.212
Can't build more seats.

16:35.323 --> 16:37.674
Then get us
backstage passes.

16:39.605 --> 16:41.027
Surprise!

16:41.770 --> 16:43.364
I redecorated!

16:43.431 --> 16:44.749
Where are
my video games?

16:44.766 --> 16:46.305
My X-Box?!
My Wii?

16:46.334 --> 16:48.836
You don't need a Wii
now that I'm here.

16:48.871 --> 16:51.566
Because you and me
make us.

16:51.601 --> 16:52.298
You know,
you're starting

16:52.333 --> 16:54.192
to remind me a lot
of my first wife.

16:54.209 --> 16:56.706
We can talk about that
after brunch with my mother.

16:56.778 --> 16:57.771
Oh!

17:00.980 --> 17:02.183
<i>Ms. Nebraska,</i>

17:02.250 --> 17:05.406
your purified water and
fried chicken skins are here.

17:09.858 --> 17:12.973
I am so tired of fans
in my food.

17:13.361 --> 17:15.096
Alaska,
we've never met,

17:15.163 --> 17:17.395
but everyone thinks
I'm your best friend.

17:17.499 --> 17:19.181
Wait.
Wait, let me guess.

17:19.215 --> 17:21.468
I'm supposed to give
all your best friends

17:21.536 --> 17:23.681
front-row seats
and backstage passes.

17:23.715 --> 17:24.492
Could you?

17:24.527 --> 17:25.973
First,
riddle me this.

17:26.040 --> 17:28.476
What's your favorite episode
of my show?

17:28.511 --> 17:29.813
You have a show?

17:31.847 --> 17:35.482
Look, can you please,
please help a poor little girl

17:35.550 --> 17:37.148
who was just trying
to fit in?

17:37.152 --> 17:39.197
It's what half your songs
are about.

17:39.521 --> 17:40.448
You know what?

17:40.689 --> 17:43.125
I was a little girl who
didn't fit in, either.

17:43.160 --> 17:44.458
So you know
what I did?

17:44.526 --> 17:46.642
I got a new nose,
I got famous,

17:46.677 --> 17:48.497
and now I date
the starting point guard

17:48.532 --> 17:49.513
for the
L.A. Clippers.

17:49.548 --> 17:50.932
Now if
you'll excuse me,

17:50.979 --> 17:52.757
I have to go
meditate and smoke.

17:55.270 --> 17:57.154
Wait.
I want to ask you something.

17:57.189 --> 17:59.549
Could you tell I lip-synched
that whole speech?

17:59.584 --> 18:00.372
<i>You know what?</i>

18:00.427 --> 18:03.143
<i>I was a little girl who
didn't fit in, either.</i>

18:03.211 --> 18:04.323
<i>So you know
what I did?</i>

18:04.363 --> 18:06.034
<i>I got a new nose,
I...</i>

18:06.148 --> 18:07.348
That's amazing.

18:07.398 --> 18:08.999
I know.
Security!

18:09.034 --> 18:12.053
You know, I think
those shirts should say insecurity.

18:12.088 --> 18:14.679
Because if you feel you have to put
what you are on your shirt,

18:14.714 --> 18:16.196
then I feel
sorry for you.

18:16.291 --> 18:17.601
Do you feel
sorry for me?

18:17.701 --> 18:19.352
Guess not.

18:23.162 --> 18:24.560
Where have you been?

18:24.595 --> 18:26.211
We have mirrors to hang!

18:26.246 --> 18:27.243
I went to a movie.

18:27.333 --> 18:28.360
Without me?

18:28.368 --> 18:29.368
How'd you get there?

18:29.402 --> 18:31.075
- I drove.
- Without me?

18:31.831 --> 18:34.006
Sometimes I think this
50-square-foot apartment

18:34.074 --> 18:35.612
isn't big enough
for the both of us!

18:35.742 --> 18:37.810
Fine!
You can have your key back!

18:39.312 --> 18:41.397
I got it halfway.

18:41.449 --> 18:42.863
D'oh!
It went back.

18:46.553 --> 18:47.876
<i>City Inspector.</i>

18:49.589 --> 18:51.057
I'm here to verify

18:51.103 --> 18:53.916
that this is the residence
of Bart and Lisa Simpson.

19:09.275 --> 19:11.587
Hello, friendos.

19:15.281 --> 19:17.878
Here comes Lisa
with our backstage passes!

19:19.252 --> 19:21.376
People,
I'm not who you think I am.

19:21.488 --> 19:24.488
I'm just a transfer student
who wanted to make some friends.

19:24.590 --> 19:25.891
Yes,
I lied to you,

19:25.959 --> 19:28.110
but you only liked me
because of a lie.

19:28.227 --> 19:29.396
So if you
think about it--

19:29.431 --> 19:30.613
Get the liar!

19:40.506 --> 19:42.292
Those are
last year's shoes!

19:42.327 --> 19:43.132
Kill her!

19:43.142 --> 19:44.377
Also, it's Lisa!

19:44.412 --> 19:45.617
Kill her twice!

19:46.691 --> 19:47.936
Go, Dog, Go!

19:48.114 --> 19:49.813
With pages missing.

19:50.483 --> 19:53.310
Lego spaceship,
poorly assembled.

19:53.587 --> 19:56.685
Clearly, this is the home of
elementary school children.

19:56.823 --> 19:57.665
Too bad.

19:57.758 --> 19:59.785
I was looking forward
to killing you

19:59.821 --> 20:01.719
and making it look
like a suicide.

20:01.895 --> 20:03.964
Thank you, friendo.

20:03.897 --> 20:05.336
I am
not your friendo.

20:05.631 --> 20:06.460
But I thought...

20:06.833 --> 20:07.898
You said...

20:09.184 --> 20:10.454
<i>Mom! Dad!</i>

20:10.470 --> 20:13.240
I have to leave Waverly Hills
and never come back.

20:13.275 --> 20:14.285
I got to get back,
too.

20:14.374 --> 20:16.662
I just remembered I was playing
hide-and-seek with Milhouse.

20:16.676 --> 20:18.021
Three weeks?!

20:18.075 --> 20:20.487
This has got to be
some kind of record.

20:20.547 --> 20:22.539
I can't leave
my bachelor pad.

20:22.582 --> 20:24.268
My bros will miss me.

20:24.303 --> 20:24.956
No, we won't!

20:25.001 --> 20:27.320
Your comments when
we watch movies aren't funny.

20:27.387 --> 20:28.563
Why do you watch comedies

20:28.599 --> 20:30.289
if you don't want to hear
more jokes?

20:30.723 --> 20:31.392
Please...

20:31.421 --> 20:33.351
I just want to go back
to a place

20:33.386 --> 20:35.817
where I'm ostracized
for being me.

20:35.829 --> 20:37.825
Not for
who I pretend to be.

20:37.864 --> 20:38.916
What do you think,
Marge?

20:38.932 --> 20:41.120
Maybe we've outgrown
our first apartment.

20:41.167 --> 20:45.248
Yeah. A house in the suburbs
does sound pretty nice right now.

20:45.805 --> 20:48.998
Although, I am gonna miss
our little love nest.

20:57.416 --> 20:58.781
Get a room!

20:58.918 --> 21:00.619
- Come on, boy. Be cool!
- But...

21:00.666 --> 21:02.312
Be cool,
or you're grounded!
