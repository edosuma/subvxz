WEBVTT

00:01.540 --> 00:04.380
Previously on "How to Get Away
with Murder"...
They know everything.

00:04.380 --> 00:05.670
I can offer you and your son
protection,

00:05.670 --> 00:06.960
but I need information
in return.

00:06.960 --> 00:08.460
Nate: We need the video.

00:08.460 --> 00:09.920
Warden Sykes is the only one
who can sign off.

00:09.920 --> 00:11.290
Give me all
the security-cam footage

00:11.290 --> 00:12.830
from your visitor's room
on this date.

00:12.830 --> 00:15.330
What is this?
I'll tell you
who killed your father.

00:15.330 --> 00:16.460
You just need to
return the favor.

00:16.460 --> 00:17.460
Laurel.

00:17.460 --> 00:18.420
Is that...

00:18.420 --> 00:19.500
My mother.

00:19.500 --> 00:20.500
Annalise:
You called Paula Gladden,

00:20.500 --> 00:21.710
the guard who lied

00:21.710 --> 00:23.500
about Nate Senior
reaching for her gun!

00:23.500 --> 00:25.580
This is all fake.
There's a photo of you
meeting with him.

00:25.580 --> 00:27.040
Or are you gonna lie
about that, too?

00:27.040 --> 00:28.330
What?

00:28.330 --> 00:30.120
Emmett's not the lawyer
in the photo.

00:30.120 --> 00:32.250
Who is it?
Frank: Xavier Castillo.

00:32.250 --> 00:33.500
Laurel's brother.

00:47.420 --> 00:49.000
Mr. Lahey.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.620
You're not my lawyer.
Not yet.

00:50.620 --> 00:52.670
But I've been following
your case.

00:52.670 --> 00:54.460
Please, sit.

00:54.460 --> 00:56.170
Uh...

00:56.170 --> 00:59.380
There ain't no way anybody's
gonna poach me from Annalise --

00:59.380 --> 01:00.880
Ms. Keating did great work
on the class action --

01:00.880 --> 01:02.120
no one's denying that.

01:02.120 --> 01:04.960
She got me a big win
a-at the damn Supreme Court!

01:04.960 --> 01:06.540
She got herself a win,

01:06.540 --> 01:08.380
but your trial date
still hasn't been set --

01:08.380 --> 01:11.420
No, she said that the judge
is gonna set that any day now.

01:11.420 --> 01:13.170
That day may never come.

01:13.170 --> 01:14.710
Bull.
You're leaving your future

01:14.710 --> 01:18.540
in the hands of one woman
and a bunch of her law students.

01:18.540 --> 01:21.210
I can offer you a team of
lawyers with endless resources.

01:21.210 --> 01:22.620
We don't want you
to end up

01:22.620 --> 01:24.710
in some
mental health hospital --

01:24.710 --> 01:26.420
we want to get you
your actual freedom.

01:28.380 --> 01:30.080
Who sent you here?

01:30.080 --> 01:32.120
Come on, man.
I'm locked up

01:32.120 --> 01:34.540
with some of the best conmen
in the country.

01:34.540 --> 01:36.750
You think I don't know when
somebody's polishing a turd?

01:36.750 --> 01:39.040
Mr. Lahey, any smart lawyer
would want you as a client.

01:39.040 --> 01:41.170
Well, you know, that
slick suit and shined shoes

01:41.170 --> 01:43.580
don't make you half the man
Annalise is.

01:45.210 --> 01:46.580
I don't think you understand
what's at stake here.

01:46.580 --> 01:47.880
Ooh-whee.

01:47.880 --> 01:49.960
Now you gonna tell me
my business?

01:49.960 --> 01:51.540
Your life depends
on this decision.

01:51.540 --> 01:54.920
And your life depends on you
getting your ass out that door.

01:54.920 --> 01:56.750
You want me
to throw you out?

01:56.750 --> 01:59.040
But I might be old, but I can
still knock those teeth out.

02:07.420 --> 02:09.330
I think you're gonna
regret this.

02:21.380 --> 02:22.880
I'm so sorry, Nate.

02:22.880 --> 02:25.830
Just tell us why
he would do this.

02:28.500 --> 02:30.880
My father.
He wasn't going to let us win.

02:30.880 --> 02:33.250
Me, or Annalise --
Annalise:
Don't include me in this.

02:33.250 --> 02:35.960
I'm just saying my brother
wouldn't do this on his own.

02:35.960 --> 02:37.500
So you're defending him?
No --

02:37.500 --> 02:38.750
Then why didn't you
warn us about him?

02:38.750 --> 02:40.290
I haven't seen him
in years --

02:40.290 --> 02:42.380
But now he's a man capable
of killing his own mother?

02:42.380 --> 02:43.920
No, I'm just trying to figure
this out like you --

02:43.920 --> 02:45.750
I put your father in jail so
that we wouldn't have to deal

02:45.750 --> 02:47.040
with your family anymore,
Laurel!

02:47.040 --> 02:48.920
We always knew Jorge
would be a threat --

02:48.920 --> 02:51.170
Don't protect her!
She just found out
her mother died --

02:51.170 --> 02:53.420
Everyone's dead!
Nate's father, Wes...

02:53.420 --> 02:55.460
they're all dead
because of you!

02:55.460 --> 02:56.750
Not Laurel, her family --

02:56.750 --> 02:58.420
I'll do whatever I can
to fix this. Okay, Annalise?

02:58.420 --> 03:00.000
I didn't think that this
was gonna happen --

03:00.000 --> 03:01.540
Because you don't think!
Ever!

03:01.540 --> 03:03.290
My point is
it's not Laurel's fault.

03:03.290 --> 03:05.120
You're right.
It's your fault.

03:05.120 --> 03:07.580
Because I never wanted to hire
her as an intern, anyway.

03:07.580 --> 03:09.330
That was your penis
that decided that.

03:09.330 --> 03:10.880
So fine.
Hate me, then.

03:10.880 --> 03:14.330
I don't want
to hate anyone!

03:14.330 --> 03:17.120
I just want my life back,
because this isn't a life!

03:18.580 --> 03:21.250
It's hell. We're all living
in hell, and I want out!

04:04.790 --> 04:07.620
Oliver:
Maybe we, uh, test the DNA

04:07.620 --> 04:09.000
to make sure
it's her hair?

04:09.000 --> 04:10.620
Or we can hand it
over to the FBI --

04:10.620 --> 04:12.620
they can add it to evidence
on their little murder board.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.670
So Laurel's brother
scalps us next?

04:14.670 --> 04:16.920
I'm just saying, unless you
want to end up in coffins

04:16.920 --> 04:18.540
or you want to meet your birth
parents in an orange jumpsuit,

04:18.540 --> 04:19.830
we need to come up
with a plan.

04:19.830 --> 04:21.250
Since when do you want to
meet your birth parents?

04:21.250 --> 04:22.380
I sent in a stupid form.

04:22.380 --> 04:23.710
It'll take weeks
to get a response.

04:23.710 --> 04:26.000
I'll probably
change my mind by then.

04:29.710 --> 04:30.960
Michaela:
What did Annalise say?

04:30.960 --> 04:32.710
Uh...
just that she hates me.

04:32.710 --> 04:34.210
Understandable, really.

04:34.210 --> 04:36.750
Asher: I really need a whiff
of that magical baby scent

04:36.750 --> 04:38.580
right about now.
Yeah, me too.

04:45.710 --> 04:47.540
W-- I told you no --

04:47.540 --> 04:48.960
I figured, after
a good night's sleep,

04:48.960 --> 04:50.960
you'd have come
to your senses.

04:50.960 --> 04:53.380
You framed me
as a terrorist.

04:53.380 --> 04:55.000
Professor Keating's
the only reason

04:55.000 --> 04:57.080
I'm not locked up
right now.
She killed your father.

04:57.080 --> 04:59.000
I think she owes you way more
than some free legal counsel.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.880
Then why isn't she in jail?

05:00.880 --> 05:03.250
She's a genius --

05:03.250 --> 05:04.330
that is even
more obvious

05:04.330 --> 05:05.880
now that she's got you
on her side --

05:05.880 --> 05:07.040
I'm not on anyone's side.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.380
Yours either.

05:08.380 --> 05:10.040
Read this before
you decide that.

05:16.620 --> 05:17.620
Who is he?

05:17.620 --> 05:19.120
Your mother's ex.

05:19.120 --> 05:21.420
They were using
drugs together.

05:21.420 --> 05:22.880
Her drugs.

05:22.880 --> 05:26.830
Your mother survived too much
to go to jail, Gabriel.

05:26.830 --> 05:29.330
But that's on you.

05:29.330 --> 05:31.670
Choose Annalise,
or choose your mother.

05:51.960 --> 05:53.380
We have about five minutes.

05:53.380 --> 05:55.080
I only need one.

05:55.080 --> 05:57.170
Crawford's phone logs
are fake.

05:57.170 --> 05:58.880
You think that I have
the ability

05:58.880 --> 06:00.620
to fabricate
phone records?

06:00.620 --> 06:04.210
Not you, but I'm sure you had
a donor who works in technology.

06:05.880 --> 06:07.330
I guess we'll fight
this out in court.

06:07.330 --> 06:09.710
Who dug up my adoption papers
for you?

06:09.710 --> 06:11.250
I bet it was that
same donor.

06:11.250 --> 06:12.460
Or was it D.A. Miller?

06:12.460 --> 06:14.880
Look at where we are,
Annalise.

06:14.880 --> 06:16.540
This is who I am.

06:16.540 --> 06:19.290
Since when is blackmailing me
something Jesus would do?

06:19.290 --> 06:22.460
You forced me into
this predicament.

06:22.460 --> 06:25.380
30 years building
the life of my dreams,

06:25.380 --> 06:28.250
and it's ruined because
of a lie you started.

06:28.250 --> 06:29.380
You think that
I have the power

06:29.380 --> 06:31.290
to get the FBI to
investigate a Governor?

06:31.290 --> 06:32.880
Well, someone did.

06:32.880 --> 06:34.120
And it worked.

06:35.920 --> 06:37.330
But I'm innocent.

06:37.330 --> 06:40.210
God knows that,
even if you don't.

06:40.210 --> 06:42.120
I don't know
what's more fake --

06:42.120 --> 06:44.250
you or
those phone records.

06:44.250 --> 06:47.120
Then let the FBI
figure it out.

06:47.120 --> 06:50.790
I had no choice but to send over
Mr. Crawford's records myself.

06:54.880 --> 06:56.210
Tegan: It's happening.

06:56.210 --> 06:58.710
What is?
The FBI's here.

06:58.710 --> 07:01.290
They're taking in Emmett
right now.

07:01.290 --> 07:03.540
Go to him.
Tell him I'm gonna fix it.

07:03.540 --> 07:04.960
Fix it?

07:04.960 --> 07:07.120
This was the Castillos.
What?

07:07.120 --> 07:08.750
They're framing Emmett.
I can prove it.

07:08.750 --> 07:10.170
Just go help him.

07:10.170 --> 07:12.500
I can't.
We were wrong, Tegan.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.920
And who do you think that family
will come after next?

07:14.920 --> 07:16.580
Me.

07:16.580 --> 07:18.330
So I'm sorry...

07:18.330 --> 07:20.620
I'm staying out of this.

07:29.500 --> 07:32.080
Here.
Miller's burner logs.

07:32.080 --> 07:33.960
Nate and I called
every number...

07:33.960 --> 07:36.210
and this one,
right here...

07:36.210 --> 07:37.380
It's the only number
now disconnected.

07:37.380 --> 07:39.380
-Stop.
-Maybe it's Xavier's.

07:39.380 --> 07:40.540
That would prove
they were working together.

07:40.540 --> 07:41.790
No more assumptions.

07:41.790 --> 07:45.250
Hey, you're right --
assumptions aren't proof,

07:45.250 --> 07:46.460
but if we just
put our heads together --

07:46.460 --> 07:48.420
I've been working
this case for weeks,

07:48.420 --> 07:50.170
telling myself Miller died
for the right reasons.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.460
That's still true.

07:51.460 --> 07:52.460
He never said one word
that night

07:52.460 --> 07:53.750
about working with anybody.

07:53.750 --> 07:55.580
He would've ratted out
who put him up to this.

07:55.580 --> 07:56.540
But he didn't.

07:57.880 --> 07:59.710
No more guessing.

08:02.880 --> 08:05.170
I didn't do this, Nate.

08:05.170 --> 08:07.710
You and Bonnie
are wrong about this.

08:07.710 --> 08:10.380
Mom, it's too early
for any of that.

08:11.790 --> 08:13.540
All right, fine.
Her name's Bonnie.

08:13.540 --> 08:15.000
And that's all
I'm telling you.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.620
So if I hear
you called my secretary

08:16.620 --> 08:18.080
to find out more
about her,

08:18.080 --> 08:19.830
well, then,
I'm probably not gonna

08:19.830 --> 08:21.920
bring her home
for Christmas, okay?

08:21.920 --> 08:24.170
Um, can I call you back?

08:24.170 --> 08:26.080
I love you, too.

08:27.750 --> 08:28.880
Can I help you?

08:30.670 --> 08:32.290
Depends.

08:34.880 --> 08:37.040
Do you want to be the D.A.?

08:43.960 --> 08:46.920
You don't wanna be the
interim guy -- you wanna
be the permanent one.

08:46.920 --> 08:48.580
But you've got no clout,

08:48.580 --> 08:50.880
and you've got no money
for a campaign.

08:50.880 --> 08:53.460
We can offer you both of those,
just like we did for Denver.

08:53.460 --> 08:55.250
You know, your father
is in jail for killing him.

08:55.250 --> 08:57.080
Annalise Keating
killed Denver.

08:57.080 --> 08:58.830
What are you talking about?

08:58.830 --> 09:00.460
Denver was about to
put Keating away.

09:00.460 --> 09:02.580
She found out, so she fixed
both her problems at once.

09:03.750 --> 09:05.040
I have proof.

09:05.040 --> 09:06.460
Well, then,
give it to the FBI.

09:06.460 --> 09:07.830
They can help you get
your dad out of jail.

09:07.830 --> 09:09.080
That's not why I'm here.

09:09.080 --> 09:10.710
Yeah. You just offered
to buy my campaign.

09:10.710 --> 09:13.040
So we can hit back
at Annalise.

09:13.040 --> 09:14.250
I know
you want that, too.

09:18.380 --> 09:19.620
How?

09:21.080 --> 09:23.500
You're familiar with
her Supreme Court client, right?

09:33.420 --> 09:35.080
Is it too early
to start drinking,

09:35.080 --> 09:37.170
or should we just eat
our feelings?

09:37.170 --> 09:38.790
You know who can't do
either of those things?

09:38.790 --> 09:40.710
Everyone who's dead
on this board.

09:40.710 --> 09:42.120
Some of whom we've killed.

09:43.290 --> 09:45.670
Okay.

09:45.670 --> 09:47.170
No more screen-time for you.

09:47.170 --> 09:48.710
Why? Are you afraid
of facing your own guilt?

09:48.710 --> 09:49.920
Now's not the time to be
thinking about this.

09:49.920 --> 09:52.120
Look, the FBI knows that
we're the bad guys.

09:52.120 --> 09:54.750
Laurel's mom's gift-bag-head
is in the other room.

09:54.750 --> 09:56.000
Now is exactly the time
to be talking about this.

09:59.750 --> 10:01.460
Gabriel wants me
to come over.

10:01.460 --> 10:02.830
To "study"?

10:02.830 --> 10:04.330
He says it's urgent.

10:05.580 --> 10:06.790
Connor: What about
Michaela and Asher?

10:06.790 --> 10:09.500
Or the godparents Christopher
already has?

10:09.500 --> 10:11.250
You think Frank and Annalise
should raise my child?

10:11.250 --> 10:14.210
No. I think you
are going to raise your child.

10:14.210 --> 10:16.040
It's just in case
something happens.

10:16.040 --> 10:17.380
Nothing's going to happen.
Connor.

10:17.380 --> 10:19.330
Look at our lives.

10:19.330 --> 10:21.920
Look, you need
a back-up plan, sure.

10:21.920 --> 10:23.210
And Oliver, I get.

10:23.210 --> 10:24.920
I want him to raise all
the babies in the world, too.

10:24.920 --> 10:28.250
I never said I wanted a baby,
let alone all the babies.

10:28.250 --> 10:29.790
I'm just asking for you
to think about it.

10:29.790 --> 10:32.460
No, you drew up
legal guardianship documents

10:32.460 --> 10:33.920
with our names on them.

10:33.920 --> 10:37.460
I did it after I met your moms,
who are amazing.

10:37.460 --> 10:40.880
Laurel, I -- I am moody
and -- and selfish.

10:40.880 --> 10:43.040
Like, I'm probably
pathologically bad

10:43.040 --> 10:44.500
at caring about
other people's emotions.

10:44.500 --> 10:45.710
You care about Oliver,

10:45.710 --> 10:47.380
and that was very clear
at the wedding.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.750
It was a wedding!
Of course, you didn't
mean any of that.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.540
Listen to me, okay?
This isn't about

10:51.540 --> 10:53.170
what's best for me,
or for you, honestly...

10:53.170 --> 10:54.460
it's what's best
for Christopher.

10:54.460 --> 10:56.750
And looking back
at my childhood,

10:56.750 --> 10:58.790
I had money, privilege --

10:58.790 --> 11:00.880
everything a stable home
is supposed to provide

11:00.880 --> 11:02.210
except for one thing --

11:02.210 --> 11:03.750
love, okay?

11:05.580 --> 11:08.500
And both of you have more
of that than any of us.

11:23.750 --> 11:26.000
Who let you in here?

11:26.000 --> 11:28.540
I said I was your lawyer.
You just have to hire me.

11:28.540 --> 11:30.460
You just accused me
of killing a man, Annalise.

11:30.460 --> 11:32.330
Because that's what
Jorge Castillo

11:32.330 --> 11:33.920
wanted me to believe.

11:33.920 --> 11:36.170
Yeah, I know.

11:36.170 --> 11:38.380
I had that same look on my face
when I found out.

11:38.380 --> 11:40.170
But who else could fake
your phone records? Who?

11:40.170 --> 11:41.710
And then, when
you consider the fact

11:41.710 --> 11:44.000
that the Governor
fed them to me?

11:44.000 --> 11:45.250
You have proof?

11:45.250 --> 11:47.000
Yes.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.290
Look...

11:49.290 --> 11:51.880
I'm not going to waste your time
apologizing again.

11:51.880 --> 11:53.960
Instead, I'm promising
to get you out of here

11:53.960 --> 11:56.330
so you can run for D.A.

11:56.330 --> 11:58.620
And I don't make that promise
to anyone.

12:03.620 --> 12:04.750
Frank:
Annalise sold Emmett.

12:04.750 --> 12:05.920
She'll call as soon
as she gets him out.

12:05.920 --> 12:07.460
You hear from Nate?

12:07.460 --> 12:09.580
Bon?

12:09.580 --> 12:11.330
He was right.

12:11.330 --> 12:13.790
There's no way this number
is Xavier's.

12:13.790 --> 12:16.330
Why not?
Look at the date...

12:16.330 --> 12:18.290
I was at Julie's then.

12:18.290 --> 12:21.670
Ron was there for me that whole
time, calling every hour...

12:21.670 --> 12:24.000
And?
There's no way
he was planning

12:24.000 --> 12:26.580
on killing Senior
during all of that.

12:26.580 --> 12:28.330
I get why that's hard
to believe.

12:28.330 --> 12:30.080
He wasn't that guy, Frank.

12:31.420 --> 12:33.580
We were wrong.

12:33.580 --> 12:35.040
I need to stay here.

12:35.040 --> 12:37.210
I don't feel good
about this.

12:37.210 --> 12:38.500
I love you,

12:38.500 --> 12:40.120
but now
I can handle this.

12:40.120 --> 12:41.460
Julie:
I'll make it right.

12:41.460 --> 12:43.830
Help you find him
if that's what you want.

12:45.040 --> 12:48.670
She wants to help me
find him.

12:48.670 --> 12:50.380
Like it's that easy...

12:50.380 --> 12:52.170
And you?

12:52.170 --> 12:53.880
Do you want to find him?

12:55.830 --> 12:57.580
Tell me about your day.

12:57.580 --> 12:59.290
Please,

12:59.290 --> 13:01.830
I just need to talk
about something normal.

13:01.830 --> 13:03.460
Oh, God, normal?

13:03.460 --> 13:05.460
Um...

13:05.460 --> 13:08.880
Okay, uh, like how Peggy
spent about 10 minutes

13:08.880 --> 13:11.080
trying to tell me how she
couldn't upgrade my phone?

13:11.080 --> 13:12.670
Be nice to her.

13:12.670 --> 13:14.120
I'm too nice.
That's the problem.

13:14.120 --> 13:16.080
That is not a bad quality.

13:16.080 --> 13:18.000
Mm, well, it is for a D.A.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Stop.
I'm serious.

13:21.710 --> 13:24.290
How would you feel
if I decided not to run?

13:24.290 --> 13:27.000
You've wanted this
your whole life.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.540
I'm just thinking
about Denver.

13:28.540 --> 13:30.500
You know, all the shady people
he had to get in bed with

13:30.500 --> 13:31.790
to win a campaign?

13:31.790 --> 13:33.540
So do it your own way.

13:33.540 --> 13:35.380
Yeah,
like it's that easy.

13:35.380 --> 13:37.710
Come on.

13:40.250 --> 13:42.960
I'm sorry, honey,
I'm just...

13:42.960 --> 13:45.080
I'm tired.

13:45.080 --> 13:46.580
You'll call me first thing
in the morning?

13:46.580 --> 13:47.960
Of course.

13:51.620 --> 13:53.790
I love you.

13:53.790 --> 13:55.500
I love you, too.

14:35.330 --> 14:36.380
Xavier: Ron?
Hey.

14:38.750 --> 14:40.580
So?
I hope this is good news.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.380
Yeah.

14:42.380 --> 14:44.500
I'll do it.

14:46.960 --> 14:48.920
What do you need
from me?

14:55.580 --> 14:56.960
Nate: Warden.

14:59.880 --> 15:01.710
Listen, I gave that footage
to Winterbottom.

15:01.710 --> 15:03.380
It's one last gift
to the both of you.

15:03.380 --> 15:05.580
You gave it to her
so she can cover your ass.

15:05.580 --> 15:07.750
So you hear me out,
or that deal's over.

15:07.750 --> 15:09.460
What do you need?

15:09.460 --> 15:13.290
Xavier Castillo, was he involved
in my pops' transfer?

15:13.290 --> 15:15.250
Who?

15:15.250 --> 15:16.580
I'm serious --
Miller was the only guy

15:16.580 --> 15:18.620
I ever talked to
about your dad.

15:18.620 --> 15:20.670
The earliest we can transfer
him is Monday morning.

15:20.670 --> 15:22.330
Well, the hospital
I got him into

15:22.330 --> 15:23.750
will have the spot filled
by then.

15:23.750 --> 15:25.500
Well, you'll just have to
wait for a new spot.

15:25.500 --> 15:28.170
Okay, you don't understand --
I need this transfer to happen

15:28.170 --> 15:29.620
by tomorrow night
at the latest.

15:29.620 --> 15:31.170
We don't do transfers
at night.

15:31.170 --> 15:32.710
Then make an exception.

15:32.710 --> 15:34.710
Exceptions are how things
go wrong when you run a prison.

15:34.710 --> 15:36.170
Come on, man, please.

15:36.170 --> 15:38.670
Just help me out here,
okay?

15:38.670 --> 15:40.170
It's important to me.

15:41.250 --> 15:42.250
So I caved.

15:42.250 --> 15:43.380
I went against my gut

15:43.380 --> 15:45.120
and gave him
his night transfer.

15:45.120 --> 15:46.790
So, here we are.

15:46.790 --> 15:48.380
And you're coming up to me
like I did something wrong.

15:48.380 --> 15:49.460
Your guards did
something wrong.

15:49.460 --> 15:50.540
That's it.
We're done.

15:50.540 --> 15:52.460
You know their story
makes no sense.

15:52.460 --> 15:54.920
You were a cop.

15:54.920 --> 15:57.170
You know what happens when
a perp reaches for your gun --

15:57.170 --> 15:59.500
That didn't happen!
It happens all the time,

15:59.500 --> 16:01.580
especially when you're
dealing with mental cases.

16:01.580 --> 16:03.880
And your dad was one
of the worst.

16:11.250 --> 16:12.580
Hello?

16:12.580 --> 16:13.920
Man: This is a collect call

16:13.920 --> 16:14.960
from the Philadelphia
Police Department,

16:14.960 --> 16:16.080
10th District.

16:16.080 --> 16:17.540
To accept the call, say yes.

16:17.540 --> 16:18.750
Yes.

16:18.750 --> 16:20.750
Nate: It's me.
What happened?

16:20.750 --> 16:24.330
I went to the Warden.
Things got heated.

16:24.330 --> 16:26.500
What did you do?

16:26.500 --> 16:29.500
It was just a little shove,
but I'm gonna need help.

16:29.500 --> 16:30.580
Of course.
I'm on it.

16:30.580 --> 16:31.960
Wait...

16:31.960 --> 16:33.540
Sykes said Miller
forced him

16:33.540 --> 16:35.330
to schedule the transfer
at night.

16:38.120 --> 16:41.210
What did I tell you?
Miller was part of it.

16:41.210 --> 16:42.790
I'll get you out
as soon as I can.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.880
He was guilty, Bon.

16:57.790 --> 16:59.040
Emmett: Bad news?

16:59.040 --> 17:00.960
Family crap.

17:02.500 --> 17:05.080
Finally.

17:05.080 --> 17:07.420
Here's the security footage
showing Xavier Castillo

17:07.420 --> 17:09.460
meeting with Mr. Lahey
last fall.

17:09.460 --> 17:11.670
If that's not enough
to release my client,

17:11.670 --> 17:13.080
then you need to look closer
at the phone records

17:13.080 --> 17:14.540
that the Governor gave you.

17:14.540 --> 17:15.790
I'm sorry,
did we tell you

17:15.790 --> 17:17.380
what evidence we have
on Mr. Crawford?

17:17.380 --> 17:19.330
The phone records were
completely fabricated

17:19.330 --> 17:20.620
by the Castillos.

17:20.620 --> 17:22.250
Now, I can tell you why,

17:22.250 --> 17:24.290
or you can talk to his father
that you already have in prison.

17:24.290 --> 17:25.880
So you believe
Jorge Castillo arranged

17:25.880 --> 17:28.290
Mr. Lahey's murder
to hit back at you?

17:28.290 --> 17:29.460
And it worked.
Once they killed him,

17:29.460 --> 17:31.000
it broke my career
and my heart.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.040
And here we are.

17:38.830 --> 17:41.250
Mr. Crawford, I don't think
I need to explain to you

17:41.250 --> 17:43.250
that we're concerned
by your choice of attorney.

17:43.250 --> 17:44.620
Concerned or intimidated?

17:44.620 --> 17:45.920
Bayer:
You are a person of interest

17:45.920 --> 17:47.670
in the death of
Ms. Keating's client.

17:47.670 --> 17:49.540
Exactly. So in what world
would she represent me

17:49.540 --> 17:51.380
if I killed Mr. Lahey?

17:51.380 --> 17:53.540
Which he didn't, by the way.
Can he go now?

17:53.540 --> 17:55.790
Not yet.
I just handed you
your suspect

17:55.790 --> 17:57.500
on a silver platter --
what more do you need?

17:57.500 --> 17:59.380
An explanation of
this recording

17:59.380 --> 18:01.250
we discovered
in Mr. Crawford's office.

18:05.250 --> 18:07.540
Tegan: Emmett's guilty.

18:07.540 --> 18:09.080
Annalise: I want
to look him in the eye.

18:09.080 --> 18:11.330
Make his guilty ass sweat.

18:11.330 --> 18:14.290
Now would you like to consider
hiring different counsel?

18:19.290 --> 18:21.080
Gabriel:
If I show you this,

18:21.080 --> 18:22.750
it means I'm trusting you
with my life.

18:22.750 --> 18:24.210
That is perhaps too big
of an ask

18:24.210 --> 18:25.500
at this stage
in our relationship.

18:25.500 --> 18:26.460
Will you listen?

18:26.460 --> 18:28.500
Okay.

18:28.500 --> 18:29.420
I'm here.

18:30.920 --> 18:34.250
Telesco wants me to help her
find something on Annalise.

18:34.250 --> 18:37.210
I told her no, but...

18:37.210 --> 18:39.000
but then
she brought me this.

18:44.080 --> 18:45.580
It's my mom's ex --

18:45.580 --> 18:48.540
Telesco's gonna say that
my mom gave him the drugs.

18:48.540 --> 18:50.420
It's enough
for a murder charge.
She's bluffing.

18:50.420 --> 18:51.750
Either way,
if my mom finds out --

18:51.750 --> 18:53.460
Your mom's gonna find out
eventually, Gabriel.

18:53.460 --> 18:57.580
No. If she finds out the truth
about the drugs...

18:57.580 --> 18:58.540
What does that mean?

19:00.790 --> 19:02.120
Wait, y-you did this?

19:02.120 --> 19:03.380
I'll tell you
once you pass the bar

19:03.380 --> 19:04.500
and you can be my lawyer.

19:04.500 --> 19:05.670
So I'm right --
this was you?

19:05.670 --> 19:07.420
Just give me something
on Annalise

19:07.420 --> 19:09.330
that involves Sam's case,
or -- or Miller's...

19:09.330 --> 19:10.580
Annalise didn't do
anything wrong.

19:10.580 --> 19:11.880
Then why won't
Telesco stop?

19:11.880 --> 19:13.210
I don't know!
No, you do know.

19:13.210 --> 19:14.420
You know, just like everyone
else in that house does.

19:14.420 --> 19:16.000
No, we don't.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.580
Then what was Laurel gonna
tell Telesco to get immunity?

19:18.580 --> 19:19.880
What?

19:21.120 --> 19:23.120
Laurel Castillo!

19:23.120 --> 19:24.880
Get your ass downstairs
right now!!

19:24.880 --> 19:26.880
What happened?
I'm gonna make
her tell you.

19:26.880 --> 19:29.000
Tell you what?
Did you meet with
Agent Telesco

19:29.000 --> 19:31.210
so she could offer
you immunity?

19:31.210 --> 19:32.830
-Immunity for what?
-Is Gabriel lying,

19:32.830 --> 19:34.920
or is Telesco lying,
or are you lying?

19:34.920 --> 19:36.830
I didn't meet with her
about immunity --

19:36.830 --> 19:38.000
-So you lied to us?
-Snake!

19:38.000 --> 19:39.500
No, I just wanted her help
figuring out

19:39.500 --> 19:41.290
if it was my mother
making those calls.

19:41.290 --> 19:42.500
So you asked her
for a deal?

19:42.500 --> 19:44.460
Okay, Telesco brought up
an immunity deal --

19:44.460 --> 19:46.080
I obviously said no!

19:46.080 --> 19:47.460
Well, then,
why not just tell us that?

19:47.460 --> 19:49.000
To prevent this
from happening!

19:49.000 --> 19:51.620
Or you were actually thinking
of turning on us.

19:51.620 --> 19:53.170
Look, I have a son, okay?

19:53.170 --> 19:55.380
I have to consider every
opportunity to protect him.

19:55.380 --> 19:56.380
Are you off
your meds again?

19:56.380 --> 19:57.540
What does that mean,
Connor?

19:57.540 --> 19:59.460
An hour ago,
you asked Oliver and me

19:59.460 --> 20:01.380

and now we find out this?

20:01.380 --> 20:03.040
-You did what?
-Guardian like parent?

20:03.040 --> 20:05.250
Why would you even ask us
if you were gonna make a deal?

20:05.250 --> 20:06.620
Because I didn't
take the deal.

20:06.620 --> 20:08.460
And this is exactly why
Telesco went to Gabriel --

20:08.460 --> 20:09.960
so that we would all turn
on each other!

20:09.960 --> 20:11.330
And, look, it's working.

Xavier Castillo.

23:19.380 --> 23:21.790
Mr. Crawford, perhaps you didn't
understand what we meant

23:21.790 --> 23:22.880
by conflict of interest.

23:22.880 --> 23:24.170

Ms. Price, you're not

that phone records
can and have been doctored

23:34.460 --> 23:35.540

23:35.540 --> 23:37.040
You don't think
it's a little convenient

23:37.040 --> 23:39.290
that you're only coming forward
with this evidence now?

23:39.290 --> 23:41.330
You mean
because I'm Jane Doe?

23:43.790 --> 23:46.040

to illegal activities

23:48.210 --> 23:50.420
concerning going public.

23:50.420 --> 23:52.460
The evidence on this drive
wasn't part of that.

23:52.460 --> 23:54.580
You're willing to testify
to that under oath?

23:54.580 --> 23:57.040
Yes.
No, that's a breach
of privilege --

23:57.040 --> 23:58.620
you could get disbarred.

23:58.620 --> 24:00.710
Only if someone
inside this room talks.

24:03.210 --> 24:06.330
But I'm taking this risk
because that's how certain I am

24:06.330 --> 24:08.170
that Mr. Crawford
is innocent

24:08.170 --> 24:10.170
of any involvement
in Nathaniel Senior's murder.

24:10.170 --> 24:11.540
This doesn't explain
why the Castillos

24:11.540 --> 24:12.830
would frame Mr. Crawford
for the murder.

24:12.830 --> 24:14.080
Actually, it does.

24:15.830 --> 24:18.040
I'm running for D.A.

24:18.040 --> 24:19.330
The Castillos
have a history

24:19.330 --> 24:21.460
of keeping D.A.s
in their pocket.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.620
Having interacted
with me at C&G,

24:23.620 --> 24:24.880
they know I can't be bought.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.790

and make up now?

24:52.880 --> 24:53.960
Let me help you.

24:53.960 --> 24:56.420
Mr. Kubecka
was a garbage contractor

24:56.420 --> 24:58.500
who informed on the mob
and got killed.

24:58.500 --> 24:59.750
The court found
that the agents on the case

24:59.750 --> 25:01.880
were in breach of their duty
to provide reasonable protection

25:01.880 --> 25:03.580
for an informant.
This is about Gabriel?

25:03.580 --> 25:05.210
Not just Gabriel,
but Laurel's mother.

25:05.210 --> 25:07.000
You told Telesco
that your mom,

25:07.000 --> 25:08.290
an informant
in Witness Protection,

25:08.290 --> 25:09.880
may be in trouble.

25:09.880 --> 25:12.210
They did nothing,
and look what happened.

25:13.500 --> 25:15.960
We take the bag to the FBI,
argue that Telesco

25:15.960 --> 25:17.670
breached her duty
to protect Sandrine.

25:17.670 --> 25:20.120
They'll fire Telesco -- she'll
stop threatening Gabriel.

25:20.120 --> 25:21.620
Tell me that I'm not
a brilliant stud

25:21.620 --> 25:23.040
that you all want to
shag right now.

25:23.040 --> 25:24.080
No.

25:25.920 --> 25:27.620
This was a warning.

25:27.620 --> 25:30.000
If my brother finds out
that we go to the FBI,

25:30.000 --> 25:31.670
he's gonna kill me
and Christopher next.

25:31.670 --> 25:33.500
He won't know.
He wasn't even
supposed to know

25:33.500 --> 25:34.920
where my mother was,
either.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.620
Okay, well,
that was my best idea.

25:43.750 --> 25:45.960
Gladden's been lying
this whole time.

25:45.960 --> 25:49.000
So why believe that she's
suddenly telling the truth?

25:49.000 --> 25:50.500
I can be very convincing.

25:54.330 --> 25:55.210
As you know.

25:59.960 --> 26:02.750
What happened to you
being a better Frank?

26:02.750 --> 26:05.170
Maybe everybody else is better
if I'm just Frank.

26:07.920 --> 26:09.290
You believe her?
Of course.

26:09.290 --> 26:11.620
Xavier
is Jorge's little bitch.

26:11.620 --> 26:15.290
And for the rest of it,
well...

26:15.290 --> 26:17.330
that's for the two of us
to figure out.

26:19.540 --> 26:21.330
What do you mean
"the rest of it"?

26:30.420 --> 26:31.920

26:31.920 --> 26:33.790
You ready to do
what you promised?

26:33.790 --> 26:35.620
What did I promise?

26:39.580 --> 26:42.620
To fix this
for all of us.

26:58.040 --> 27:00.080
Xavier, hi.

27:00.080 --> 27:01.250
Ma'am, please step back.

27:01.250 --> 27:04.330

27:04.330 --> 27:05.670

27:05.670 --> 27:06.750
Annalise: And me?

27:10.830 --> 27:12.670
You happy to see me, too?

27:20.920 --> 27:22.960
Michaela:
This is Michaela Pratt.

27:22.960 --> 27:24.120
A text or e-mail
is preferred to voicemail.

27:24.120 --> 27:26.750
Um, look...

27:26.750 --> 27:30.290
i-if you don't want
to help me, fine.

27:30.290 --> 27:33.620
I-I'm used to handling things
on my own, anyway.

27:33.620 --> 27:36.500
I just thought that maybe
someone smarter than me

27:36.500 --> 27:42.500
could help me with this one,
but...no worries.

27:42.880 --> 27:44.790
I'll be good.

27:44.790 --> 27:46.540
Why am I starting
to feel sorry for him?

27:46.540 --> 27:47.620
Because he's smart --
that's what he wants.

27:47.620 --> 27:49.250
And I want to help him.
Michaela.

27:49.250 --> 27:50.540
Gabriel told us that Telesco
came to him

27:50.540 --> 27:51.830
when he didn't have to.

27:51.830 --> 27:53.500
Why would he do that
if we couldn't trust him?

27:53.500 --> 27:54.750
And -- And I know
that makes me sound naive,

27:54.750 --> 27:57.750
but...he has no one.

27:57.750 --> 27:59.460
Meanwhile,
we all have each other.

27:59.460 --> 28:00.580
Allegedly.

28:03.290 --> 28:06.210
Laurel almost sold us out,
and my idea was good.

28:06.210 --> 28:07.580
She was the only one
that said no.

28:07.580 --> 28:09.580
But it's the only way
that we take down Telesco

28:09.580 --> 28:12.540
and stall her stupid
Operation Bonfire.

28:12.540 --> 28:15.540
Take action now,
ask for forgiveness later.

28:15.540 --> 28:16.790
That's what
Annalise would do.

28:16.790 --> 28:18.210
And what you did
with Simon.

28:18.210 --> 28:21.250
Enough about Simon.
It worked, didn't it?

28:21.250 --> 28:22.790
Asher:
I say we take a vote.

28:22.790 --> 28:25.210
If it's not unanimous,
we don't do it.

28:26.330 --> 28:28.000
So, who's in?

28:34.080 --> 28:36.290
So, are you gonna deny
this is you?

28:36.290 --> 28:38.170
Say someone Photoshopped
your head?

28:39.290 --> 28:40.290
Stop.

28:41.670 --> 28:43.080
Can you just tell me
why you did this?

28:43.080 --> 28:45.330
Don't tell me
you did this for Dad.
I'm sorry. What is it
you think I did, huh?

28:45.330 --> 28:47.250
You paid those guards
to kill him!
No. No, no, no.

28:47.250 --> 28:48.880
I tried to get him to fire
his lawyer -- that's all.

28:48.880 --> 28:50.880
Why?
Why? Because this woman
has destroyed our family.

28:50.880 --> 28:52.500
Oh, please,
your family was destroyed

28:52.500 --> 28:53.580
way before I came along.

28:53.580 --> 28:54.710
You wanted to hurt me,

28:54.710 --> 28:56.170
and this was
your sick way of doing it.

28:56.170 --> 28:57.290
See, if I wanted
to hurt you,

28:57.290 --> 28:58.790
I'd actually hurt you
and not the old man.

28:58.790 --> 29:01.170
Oh, how?
By burning me up in my house?

29:01.170 --> 29:03.500
Scalping my head?

29:03.500 --> 29:05.500
What?
You know what
she's talking about.

29:05.500 --> 29:07.290
No, I don't.

29:07.290 --> 29:08.960
What you did to Mom.

29:10.670 --> 29:13.540
We're told you have evidence
regarding Sandrine Castillo?

29:13.540 --> 29:14.880
Asher: Yes, sir.

29:14.880 --> 29:16.580
Uh, I came on behalf
of Laurel Castillo,

29:16.580 --> 29:20.250
who was, uh, too scared
to come here herself.

29:20.250 --> 29:22.040
Why?
Because the last time
she was here,

29:22.040 --> 29:24.290
she talked
to Agent Telesco

29:24.290 --> 29:27.500
and told her that
her mother might be in danger.

29:27.500 --> 29:29.880
She did nothing, and...

29:29.880 --> 29:33.380
this, uh,
arrived at her door.

29:41.960 --> 29:45.420
It's Sandrine Castillo's.

29:45.420 --> 29:47.880
We believe she was killed
by her son.

29:50.250 --> 29:51.790
Xavier: I haven't heard
from Mom in months.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.250
Laurel: Because she didn't want
you to know where she was.

29:53.250 --> 29:55.000
Yeah, but you knew
where she was?

29:55.000 --> 29:56.830
No. But she called me
on Christmas --

29:56.830 --> 29:58.040
you probably
already know that,

29:58.040 --> 29:59.670
'cause that's how
you found out where she was.

29:59.670 --> 30:01.330
You were the last one that saw
her alive, Laurel -- not me.

30:01.330 --> 30:03.040
And she begged me
to forgive her.

30:03.040 --> 30:05.540
She dug her nails into my arm
asking me not to leave,

30:05.540 --> 30:06.830
because she knew

30:06.830 --> 30:09.210
that Christopher and I
weren't gonna be safe.

30:09.210 --> 30:10.670
And that's exactly
what happened.

30:10.670 --> 30:12.540
She was right.

30:12.540 --> 30:14.080
You've turned into Dad.

30:14.080 --> 30:15.380
Connor: Your mom's
just being careful.

30:15.380 --> 30:18.080
There's no way that
I'd have to be your dad.

30:18.080 --> 30:20.790
Even though
I would be good at it...

30:20.790 --> 30:22.830
because I think
you're very cool.

30:22.830 --> 30:24.540
And funny.

30:24.540 --> 30:26.170
And smart.

30:26.170 --> 30:29.710
Just like your mom and dad --
it's no surprise there...

30:30.790 --> 30:32.670
Wow.

30:37.330 --> 30:38.670
You know,
if Laurel doesn't die,

30:38.670 --> 30:40.960
maybe we should have
a baby of our own.

30:43.750 --> 30:45.460
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa!

30:45.460 --> 30:47.250
Xavier: You're not making
any sense right now.

30:47.250 --> 30:48.710
Can you just tell us
the truth, Xavier?

30:48.710 --> 30:50.620
You know, all I ever wanted
was for you to be happy --

30:50.620 --> 30:52.250
now look at what this woman
has done to you.

30:52.250 --> 30:53.750
I told you that
he would just lie.

30:53.750 --> 30:56.170
Can we go?
You go, I still have
something to say.

30:56.170 --> 30:57.380
I don't care
what you have to say.

30:57.380 --> 31:00.000
What did you offer Miller?
Hmm?

31:00.000 --> 31:01.580
Tell me.

31:01.580 --> 31:03.580
Did you promise
to make him D.A.?

31:03.580 --> 31:05.120
Pay for his campaign?

31:08.460 --> 31:10.040
Do you want
to be the D.A.?

31:11.540 --> 31:13.000
But you couldn't
win him over, could you?

31:13.000 --> 31:15.250
Because it's too easy
to play you.

31:15.250 --> 31:16.580
So that's what he did.

31:19.420 --> 31:20.620
So?
I hope this is good news.

31:20.620 --> 31:22.040
Yeah.

31:22.040 --> 31:23.460
I'll do it.

31:23.460 --> 31:24.880
What do you need from me?

31:24.880 --> 31:26.250
Talk to the Warden.

31:26.250 --> 31:29.250
Get the old man a transfer
on Thursday morning.

31:29.250 --> 31:30.920
My guards will be
working then.

31:30.920 --> 31:33.460
Thursday morning --
got it.

31:33.460 --> 31:35.880
You took his word for it.

31:35.880 --> 31:37.210
You believed
he would help you,

31:37.210 --> 31:38.830
and, instead,
the boy played you,

31:38.830 --> 31:41.830
because you couldn't bribe
a pathetic interim D.A.

31:41.830 --> 31:43.420
to get what you needed...

31:45.580 --> 31:48.040
You don't understand --
I need this transfer to happen

31:48.040 --> 31:49.380
by tomorrow night
at the latest.

31:49.380 --> 31:51.120
We don't do transfers
at night.

31:51.120 --> 31:52.500
Then make an exception.

31:52.500 --> 31:54.710
I bet that happens
a lot in your life.

31:54.710 --> 31:56.960
People take advantage
of your bad instincts...

31:56.960 --> 31:59.540
That's why your father fought
so hard to get Laurel back.

31:59.540 --> 32:01.920
She's the one who shares
his mind, his gut...

32:01.920 --> 32:03.710
you're the disappointment.

32:03.710 --> 32:05.880
It's why you fight so hard
for Daddy's love,

32:05.880 --> 32:07.750
but you fail every time.

32:07.750 --> 32:09.830
Just like you failed
at this.

32:09.830 --> 32:11.250
Who says I failed?

32:15.120 --> 32:16.420
Reporter:
Police have just confirmed

32:16.420 --> 32:18.170
that
Nathaniel Lahey Senior,

32:18.170 --> 32:20.380
the named plaintiff in a recent
Supreme Court case,

32:20.380 --> 32:22.670
was fatally shot this evening.

32:22.670 --> 32:24.330
Details have yet to emerge...

32:24.330 --> 32:26.830
...but reporters say Lahey
was being transferred

32:26.830 --> 32:28.880
to a mental health facility
when the shooting occurred...

32:30.250 --> 32:33.330
Nice try with the early
transfer.

32:33.330 --> 32:35.830
I guess
I underestimated you.

32:35.830 --> 32:38.620
And you, me.

32:38.620 --> 32:41.790
You play me again, I will
take out everyone you love.

32:41.790 --> 32:43.670
The girlfriend first.

32:46.920 --> 32:48.170
I'm sure your father
is not happy

32:48.170 --> 32:49.830
about the mess
you made here...

32:49.830 --> 32:51.620
You're not as good at this
as you think you are.

32:51.620 --> 32:53.790
Did the Governor approach you
with this plan? Huh?

32:53.790 --> 32:56.000
She promise to get your father
out of jail? Pardon him?

32:56.000 --> 32:58.750
Laurel, I'll be here
whenever you need me, okay?

32:58.750 --> 32:59.920
Be careful how far
you want to push this.

32:59.920 --> 33:01.620
Why should I be careful?

33:01.620 --> 33:03.250
You're the one helping
the Governor to bring me down,

33:03.250 --> 33:04.670
but guess what --
I'm still standing.

33:04.670 --> 33:05.670
Yeah,
so why come here, huh?

33:05.670 --> 33:06.750
Just so you could
shout at me?

33:06.750 --> 33:09.080
Shut up. You're just as boring
as you think.

33:10.380 --> 33:13.330
But you lost this round, boo.

33:13.330 --> 33:15.710
And the FBI has everything
they need to arrest you

33:15.710 --> 33:17.460
and your pathetic ass.

33:18.710 --> 33:20.620
Turn yourself in.

33:20.620 --> 33:23.120
Maybe they'll let you share
the same cell as your father.

33:28.830 --> 33:30.380
Just let me go.

33:30.380 --> 33:31.670
You and Dad.

33:46.620 --> 33:48.830
Yeah, it's me.

33:48.830 --> 33:50.500

33:50.500 --> 33:51.880

Of course they do.

33:53.120 --> 33:56.040
So, Plan B?

33:56.040 --> 33:57.880
She's given us
no other choice.

34:05.290 --> 34:06.960
This is insane.

34:06.960 --> 34:09.670
Okay. I know this isn't
a celebration, per se,

34:09.670 --> 34:11.330
but I feel like we need
to toast to the fact

34:11.330 --> 34:12.620
that we got
an FBI agent fired,

34:12.620 --> 34:15.580
a move that AK should
pay me the 64K for,

34:15.580 --> 34:18.830
even if Xavier comes
and tries to kill us.

34:18.830 --> 34:21.580

Please tell me
