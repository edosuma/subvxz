The elk?

Elk season's a month off.

04:50.328 --> 04:52.996
Means this is also a murder.

04:53.097 --> 04:55.565
Considering all the hunting
we got out here,

04:55.667 --> 04:58.268
it's pretty easy for game
wardens to make enemies fast.

respect what we do,

This time of year, the antlers

10:04.742 --> 10:07.043
No. Most head hunters
wouldn't even bother.

10:07.144 --> 10:10.080
Most poachers don't partially
gut the animal, either,

something else.

why the poacher took the head.

was killing elk

10:46.317 --> 10:48.084

Well, there's a big, big market
in herbal medicines

10:50.688 --> 10:52.188
if you can find
the raw materials.

10:52.289 --> 10:56.760

hire a few hunters to --

can make their remedies.

[ Whistling continues ]

35:37.331 --> 35:39.633
Please, um,
let me get that for you.

35:39.734 --> 35:41.568
Oh, thank you.

35:41.669 --> 35:44.104
The tea's already in the pot,

35:44.205 --> 35:46.373
and there's another cup
on the counter there.

35:46.474 --> 35:47.941
[ Whistling stops ]
You take a seat.

35:48.042 --> 35:50.377
Allow me.
Okeydokey.

35:50.478 --> 35:53.647
[ Water pouring ]

35:55.917 --> 35:57.551
There you go.

35:59.320 --> 36:03.990
I was so sorry to hear about
your wife's passing.

36:04.091 --> 36:06.359
You two knew one another?

36:06.460 --> 36:09.262
A little.
We were chemo buddies.

36:12.366 --> 36:15.101
She never mentioned you.
It was a group of us.

36:15.203 --> 36:18.471
We kind of
formed a private club.

36:18.573 --> 36:21.508
Martha would always say,
"Admission is free

36:21.609 --> 36:23.510
'cause we've all
paid our dues."

36:23.611 --> 36:25.712
[ Chuckles ]

36:27.949 --> 36:31.351
I was surprised
she was taken so quickly.

36:31.452 --> 36:35.956
Considering what I'm going
through at this stage,

36:36.057 --> 36:39.226
I'm grateful she was spared
this kind of pain.

36:42.129 --> 36:45.198
What kind of treatment do they have you on?
None.

36:45.299 --> 36:49.836
The last round of radiation
almost did me in.

36:49.937 --> 36:51.438
It's funny.

36:51.539 --> 36:54.174
You take medicine
trying to kill a disease,

36:54.275 --> 36:56.509
and it almost kills you.

36:56.611 --> 36:59.279
I told Lee, I said, no more.

36:59.380 --> 37:03.283
No more doctors, no more
hospitals, no more medicine.

37:03.384 --> 37:07.454
So, uh...
what's all this, then?

37:07.555 --> 37:11.157
Just herbal remedies.

37:11.259 --> 37:14.194
You familiar with a supplement
called velvetine?

37:14.295 --> 37:16.529
Yeah, Lee got it for me

37:16.631 --> 37:18.365
after he read about it
on the Internet.

37:18.466 --> 37:21.935
Supposed to be
some kind of miracle cure.

37:22.036 --> 37:24.471
I don't know if it's
making me any better,

37:24.572 --> 37:27.240
but it makes him feel better
when I take it.

37:27.341 --> 37:29.042
Do you know
where he gets it from?

37:31.112 --> 37:33.146
[ Grunts ]
[ Dishes clatter ]

37:38.286 --> 37:39.519
[ Screams ]
Lee!

37:39.620 --> 37:43.290
One man's already dead,
Lee! [ Grunts ]

37:43.391 --> 37:45.425
Lee! Stop this!

37:45.526 --> 37:46.626
You listen to her.

37:48.062 --> 37:48.728
Stop.

37:51.265 --> 37:53.967
[ Whimpers ]

37:57.271 --> 38:00.807
Lee, what is going on here?

38:00.908 --> 38:02.042
Please tell me.

38:02.143 --> 38:04.044
He was trying to save you.

38:04.145 --> 38:05.845
What?

38:05.946 --> 38:07.447
[ Sighs ]

38:07.548 --> 38:10.984
I was just trying to
get your medicine for you.

38:11.085 --> 38:13.253
The velvetine.

38:13.354 --> 38:16.323
Keith Dixon came by my shop

38:16.424 --> 38:18.925
with a sample of the velvetine,

38:19.026 --> 38:21.161
and it worked.

38:21.262 --> 38:24.097
I could see the change in you
right away.

38:24.198 --> 38:27.901
But when we ran out, I...

38:28.002 --> 38:30.537
I couldn't afford it.

38:30.638 --> 38:33.273
I looked everywhere,
tried everything.

38:33.374 --> 38:35.975
And you couldn't stand by,

38:36.060 --> 38:39.245
let that disease win --
you had to fight it.

38:39.346 --> 38:41.614
So you decided to
make your own velvetine.

38:41.699 --> 38:44.217
But that game warden caught me.

38:44.318 --> 38:48.388
He was gonna take me in,
and that would've meant jail.

38:48.489 --> 38:52.292
So we fought.

38:52.393 --> 38:55.195
And I stabbed him.
[ Sobs ]

38:55.296 --> 38:57.197
I couldn't let him
take me away --

38:57.298 --> 38:59.833
not -- not with Bonnie
in her condition.

38:59.934 --> 39:02.402
It was either him or your wife.

39:02.503 --> 39:04.371
[ Voice breaking ] Yes.

39:06.273 --> 39:08.541
Lee, baby.

39:08.642 --> 39:11.978
I am not getting better.

39:12.079 --> 39:14.381
You have to let me go.

39:14.482 --> 39:16.950
You have to.

39:17.051 --> 39:20.353
[ Crying ]
No. No. I never will.

39:23.624 --> 39:26.259
Hey.

39:26.360 --> 39:29.362
I was beginning to
wonder about you.

39:29.463 --> 39:31.865
You disappeared for a bit.

39:31.966 --> 39:34.367
Been a little preoccupied.

39:34.468 --> 39:37.203
Did you know Cady Longmire
was in a car accident?

39:37.304 --> 39:40.340
She okay?

39:40.441 --> 39:43.376
She will be.

39:43.477 --> 39:46.212
But I've been looking into the
circumstances of the accident,

39:46.313 --> 39:48.982
and I found some odd things.

39:49.083 --> 39:51.251
First...I found

39:51.352 --> 39:54.187
a round puncture in the
side wall of a brand-new tire

39:54.288 --> 39:57.457
on the station wagon
that Cady was driving.

39:57.558 --> 40:00.493
Not the tread,
but the side wall,

40:00.594 --> 40:04.531
meaning someone
flattened that tire on purpose.

40:04.632 --> 40:07.567
Also lifted a fingerprint
off the car

40:07.668 --> 40:10.570
right above the rear-back
flat tire.

40:10.671 --> 40:14.174
Belongs to a guy named
David Ridges.

40:14.275 --> 40:16.342
Tried to visit him at home,
he wasn't there,

40:16.444 --> 40:19.379
but I did find an interesting
detail on his résumé.

40:19.480 --> 40:21.981
You found...

40:22.082 --> 40:26.286
that David works for me.

40:26.387 --> 40:28.221
Normally, I wouldn't
blink at that.

40:28.322 --> 40:30.089
You have a lot of employees,

40:30.191 --> 40:32.125
but then I remembered
what you said

40:32.226 --> 40:35.295
about retail politics.

40:35.396 --> 40:38.465
Getting more of
our own voters to the polls,

40:38.566 --> 40:42.435
keeping more of
the other guy's voters away.

40:42.536 --> 40:45.271
You didn't have anything to do
with Cady's accident, did you?

40:45.372 --> 40:48.541
You know, my people have had

40:48.642 --> 40:51.978
a bad couple of centuries.

40:52.079 --> 40:55.148
Some of us have learned that
to get by in the present,

40:55.249 --> 40:57.250
you need to let go of the past.

40:57.351 --> 41:01.387
In fact, I'd imagine that
I have already forgotten more

41:01.489 --> 41:04.324
than most people
will ever experience

41:04.425 --> 41:07.927
in their lives.

41:08.028 --> 41:12.332
My advice to you
would be to do the same.

41:12.433 --> 41:14.067
Don't look back.

41:14.168 --> 41:17.036
Could lead to real pain.

41:17.137 --> 41:19.939
It's better to keep your eyes

41:20.040 --> 41:22.642
down the road, my man,

41:22.743 --> 41:25.545
on your very bright future.

41:25.646 --> 41:28.581
Not really an answer, Jacob.

41:34.388 --> 41:37.123
I'll see you around.

41:42.263 --> 41:44.531
Favorite from the Busy Bee.

Biscuits and gravy.

41:46.467 --> 41:48.134
Thank you.

41:52.540 --> 41:55.375
Have you gotten any sleep
in the last few days?

41:55.476 --> 41:58.278
I plan to.

41:58.379 --> 42:01.548
Things are starting to
settle down.

42:01.649 --> 42:05.285
Got a full team back
at the station again, so...

42:05.386 --> 42:07.587
decided to
keep your boyfriend on.

42:09.523 --> 42:11.958
He's not my boyfriend.

42:12.059 --> 42:15.361
I'm...
not sure what he is.

42:15.462 --> 42:18.331
Well, whatever.

42:18.432 --> 42:22.335
"Whatever"?
[ Chuckles ]

42:22.436 --> 42:25.738
I don't think I've ever heard you
say that word my entire life.

42:29.176 --> 42:32.445
I know I had some issues
with branch in the past, but...

42:32.546 --> 42:34.447
I got to let that go.

42:34.548 --> 42:39.218
I got to
let a lot of things go.

42:39.320 --> 42:41.487
Maybe I'm just
starting to mellow.

42:43.490 --> 42:46.392
I should
get hit by a car more often.

42:46.493 --> 42:48.628
No.

42:48.729 --> 42:51.230
Once was enough.
