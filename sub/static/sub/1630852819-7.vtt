that vaguely resembles a toilet.

00:53.787 --> 00:57.391
Are you se-- You peed in that?

00:57.391 --> 00:59.993
Oh, my-- That's the highest
squat of all time!

00:59.993 --> 01:02.262
-All right, all right, okay.
-Right.

01:02.262 --> 01:04.665
-Are you sure you're gonna be
able to find it on your own?
-Yeah.

01:04.665 --> 01:06.333
I know you're a grown man,
but like,

01:06.333 --> 01:08.035
-I do get a little
bit concerned that you're not...
-I know.

01:08.035 --> 01:10.837
-Yeah, it's totally fine.
-No, no, no, not there.

01:11.905 --> 01:15.242
-Does this ooze, too?
What's going on?
-No.

01:15.242 --> 01:18.712
-Yeah?
-I just feel like something...

01:18.712 --> 01:20.847
happened on the bench.
I don't know what.

01:20.847 --> 01:23.183
-I'm having, like, a lot of
half memories.
-Okay.

01:23.183 --> 01:25.886
Right now. That bodega
feels very familiar.

01:25.886 --> 01:27.387
I have no idea why.

01:27.387 --> 01:29.590
And also, we passed
a parking lot back there,

01:29.590 --> 01:31.792
-and something definitely
happened in it.
-Yeah.

01:31.792 --> 01:34.728
-But I don't, I don't know what.
-Okay.

01:34.728 --> 01:38.098
No, no, I get it. I worked at
this restaurant in high school,

01:38.098 --> 01:41.935
and I don't remember anything
about it, just the drinks.

01:41.935 --> 01:47.140
There was this vodka rum
brain freeze that was perfect.

01:47.140 --> 01:52.112
-Uh...
-Well, thank you for this tour
of how you've thrown up

01:52.112 --> 01:54.314
in every trash can
from here to Midtown.

01:54.314 --> 01:56.483
Oh, I would never drink
in Midtown.

01:56.483 --> 01:58.785
-Takes a lot of
the pressure off. Yeah.
-Good, I'm glad.

01:58.785 --> 02:01.388
Um, all right, well,
go have fun.

02:01.388 --> 02:03.123
I won't. I am pitching
my life's work

02:03.123 --> 02:07.227
to everybody that I hated in
high school, so there you go.

02:07.227 --> 02:09.329
-Well, I'm gonna go find a
crappy bathroom to change in.
-Cool. Sounds good.

02:09.329 --> 02:11.465
-I'll catch you later for
a virgin brain freeze, right?
-Yeah.

02:11.465 --> 02:15.402
-Oh, that's just ice, but...
-Sounds good.

02:15.402 --> 02:17.504
-Good luck!
-Thanks!

02:17.504 --> 02:20.307
STEPHANIE: It's so wild.
Like, they show you photos

02:20.307 --> 02:23.610
when they are toddlers
or like when they're 12,

02:23.610 --> 02:25.278
but you cannot
see them as adults.

02:25.278 --> 02:28.281
Like, what did this nose
grow into? You know?

02:29.149 --> 02:31.785
-Babe-a-rooney? Are you with me?
-Yes. Sorry.

02:31.785 --> 02:33.253
Sorry, sorry, sorry. Yes.

02:33.253 --> 02:35.622
Okay. Let's select some semen.

02:35.622 --> 02:39.459
No. Okay, it's not
a yucky game show, it's DNA.

02:39.459 --> 02:41.695
-Okay.
-It's for our baby. Okay.

02:41.695 --> 02:43.764
"Engineer with
an electric personality."

02:43.764 --> 02:46.767
Mmm. Let's hear his voice.

02:46.767 --> 02:50.103
MAN:
I grew up with two younger
sisters and one older brother.

02:50.103 --> 02:52.172
Our parents were loving
but very hardworking.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.674
So not around a lot.

02:53.674 --> 02:57.544
It's really nice and mellow,
it's like a warm buttery scotch.

02:57.544 --> 02:59.646
I wonder what inspired him.

02:59.646 --> 03:01.048
What do you mean?
What does that mean?

03:01.048 --> 03:02.816
You know, like in the room,
in the lab.

03:02.816 --> 03:05.519
You know, like...
(mimics beeping)

03:05.519 --> 03:07.120
Like, I think knowing that
would be

03:07.120 --> 03:09.156
a lot more revealing than
hearing the sound of voice.

03:09.156 --> 03:13.193
God, what if he was, like, doing
it while he was recording that?

03:13.193 --> 03:14.561
-Yuck town.
-(Josh meows)

03:14.561 --> 03:16.697
-Right, Josh?
-Josh was like "yuck."

03:16.697 --> 03:19.433
-(phone buzzes)
-Hold on, sorry. One sec.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.001
Seriously?

03:21.001 --> 03:22.836
I have to respond to
my sponsees. It's my job.

03:22.836 --> 03:25.906
-We can go back to this.
-It's literally not your job.

03:25.906 --> 03:28.642
Okay, fine. Whatever.

03:28.642 --> 03:30.343
We will see you after, but then

03:30.343 --> 03:31.845
you'll probably have to do
your real job

03:31.845 --> 03:33.747
and then we'll just never
get back to it.

03:33.747 --> 03:35.782
You always take him
when you're mad at me.

03:35.782 --> 03:37.684
I work off of his vibe,
not the other way around,

03:37.684 --> 03:38.985
so turn inward. Come on.

03:38.985 --> 03:41.521
-OLIVIA: He's freaking out.
-He loves me!

03:42.656 --> 03:43.824
(phone buzzing)

03:51.364 --> 03:53.366
(quiet chatter)

03:55.102 --> 03:57.671
(Samantha clears throat)

03:57.671 --> 04:00.674
NATHANIEL:
Oh, there she is! Sammy Fink!

04:00.674 --> 04:02.876
You made it!

04:02.876 --> 04:04.211
Come on up.

04:04.211 --> 04:05.512
-Up there?
-Yeah.

04:05.512 --> 04:07.214
-Come on up.
-Right. Is there a...?

04:07.214 --> 04:09.216
Yeah. Get up here.
Come on, let's do it.

04:13.553 --> 04:16.223
Come on in.
Make yourself comfortable.

04:16.223 --> 04:17.758
Have a seat.

04:17.758 --> 04:19.459
-Sweet office, right?
-Yeah.

04:19.459 --> 04:22.095
-Kick-ass view.
-Mm-hmm.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.631
-I guess I'll...
-Yeah.

04:24.631 --> 04:25.665
Cool chair, right?

04:25.665 --> 04:27.801
-Spooky.
-(chair creaks)

04:27.801 --> 04:30.470
Yeah. I've never sat in it.
So, is it comfortable?

04:30.470 --> 04:32.806
-Yeah.
-Oh, good.

04:32.806 --> 04:34.274
-Mm-hmm.
-So, look, uh...

04:34.274 --> 04:35.742
I gotta be honest with you,

04:35.742 --> 04:38.178
that-that thing
you sent me is brilliant.

04:38.178 --> 04:40.714
I mean, it really felt
like an alcoholic's take

04:40.714 --> 04:42.749
on Joan Didion's
"Leaving New York."

04:42.749 --> 04:47.154
-Wow. Thank you.
-Yeah, I mean, we would never
publish it here,

04:47.154 --> 04:49.956
but you should definitely
submit it somewhere smarter.

04:49.956 --> 04:54.161
Okay. Um, what kind of stuff
do you want to publish here?

04:54.161 --> 04:57.798
You know, we're looking for
a voice, a female voice,

04:57.798 --> 05:02.068
something that's, you know,
a little snarky, kinda bitchy,

05:02.068 --> 05:04.171
but you know, not in a mean way.

05:04.171 --> 05:06.506
It's coming from the woman,
so it's cool.

05:06.506 --> 05:09.543
Just somebody to kind of cover
local events like

05:09.543 --> 05:13.914
gallery openings, plays,
interactive experiences,

05:13.914 --> 05:14.948
whatever those are.

05:14.948 --> 05:15.949
I think I could do that.

05:15.949 --> 05:18.518
I have a female voice,

05:18.518 --> 05:21.021
-I'm not mean all the time.
-(chuckling) Right.

05:21.021 --> 05:23.356
Look, Sam, um...

05:23.356 --> 05:25.058
You could be a really
good fit here,

05:25.058 --> 05:27.227
that's why I thought of you,
but, um...

05:27.227 --> 05:29.996
I gotta...
I gotta be honest with you.

05:29.996 --> 05:33.700
Smug Media, they're owned
by a parent corporation.

05:33.700 --> 05:37.304
And that corporation
is all about "accountability."

05:37.304 --> 05:39.573
-Right.
-There were concerns.

05:39.573 --> 05:41.641
There were worries
when your name came up

05:41.641 --> 05:43.476
because of your past
behavior and...

05:43.476 --> 05:46.179
Yeah, yeah. You can tell them
that I'm fully accountable now.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.281
I mean, I have to be,
I have a probation officer.

05:48.281 --> 05:52.018
Uh, I will definitely
not tell them that.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.987
But, good to know.

05:55.188 --> 05:58.525
-Okay, I gotta ask.
-Mm-hmm.

05:58.525 --> 06:02.229
-Was I your bottom?
-Yeah, everyone always
wants to know that,

06:02.229 --> 06:03.663
but there wasn't really
a specific thing;

06:03.663 --> 06:04.931
it was just kind of like a hole

06:04.931 --> 06:06.766
that I kept digging
and digging and digging.

06:06.766 --> 06:09.302
You know. Ruined my
relationship with my mom,

06:09.302 --> 06:10.837
ruined my relationship
with my friends,

06:10.837 --> 06:12.372
impossible to date anybody...

06:12.372 --> 06:15.175
I just kind of ended up
as this, like, broken,

06:15.175 --> 06:18.845
sad, empty shell
of a human being.

06:20.046 --> 06:21.514
Oh.

06:22.782 --> 06:24.084
Okay.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.621
You know, I also, um...

06:27.621 --> 06:29.522
I threw up on
the Staten Island ferry once

06:29.522 --> 06:31.591
and the wind kind of blew it
right back in my face.

06:31.591 --> 06:33.793
(laughing):
Oh, God.

06:33.793 --> 06:35.729
-Gross! Really?
-Mm-hmm.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.364
-Did it get in your mouth?
-Yeah.

06:37.364 --> 06:40.433
Oh, my God. And then did you
throw up again? Like...

06:40.433 --> 06:43.570
(imitating vomiting)

06:43.570 --> 06:46.239
Oh, my God. See? This is
the kind of stuff I love.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.408
Like, this-- if we were
still at Bzzzzzzzzz,

06:48.408 --> 06:50.243
this would be
a perfect listicle.

06:50.243 --> 06:51.244
Oh, my God.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.716

-Hey, James? Trip Nemshin.
-How's it going, man?

07:17.237 --> 07:19.673
So, where's the rest
of your team?

07:19.673 --> 07:21.274
Oh, no team, just me.

07:21.274 --> 07:24.077
Oh. No, uh, no system architect?

07:24.077 --> 07:25.779
No, I did the infrastructure,
the coding, all of it.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.949
Wow, that's rare.
Never see that.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.284
Yeah, I'm like
a good steak, right?

07:33.186 --> 07:34.587
-Because of the rare...
-Yeah.

07:34.587 --> 07:35.855
-Yeah. Let's see what you got.
-Okay. All right.

07:35.855 --> 07:38.425
-Come on back!
-Yeah.

07:39.659 --> 07:40.827
VENDOR:
There you go, buddy.

07:40.827 --> 07:41.828
-You have a good one.
-Thanks, man.

07:43.363 --> 07:46.433
-Hot dog no relish lady.
-Yeah, that's me.

07:46.433 --> 07:48.368
-Hot dog guy!
-Yeah.

07:48.368 --> 07:50.937
I always wondered
if you were still alive.

07:50.937 --> 07:53.406
Well, uh... yeah.

07:53.406 --> 07:55.575
I'll... I'll take a hot dog,
no relish.

07:58.111 --> 08:01.114
Whoa. Sorry,
can you break a hundo?

08:01.114 --> 08:04.184
(chuckles) Good for you,
hot dog no relish,

08:04.184 --> 08:05.452
you're doing well.

08:08.021 --> 08:10.390
-There you go.
-Thanks.

08:10.390 --> 08:14.327
BOB:
Seven, eight, fifteen. Nice.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.462
(phone buzzing)

08:16.930 --> 08:19.699
-Wait, wait. It's Sam.
-Oh. Okay.

08:19.699 --> 08:20.934
-Hi!
-SAMANTHA: Hey.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.168
Are you okay? How'd it go?

08:22.168 --> 08:24.170
It was, uh, it was super weird,

08:24.170 --> 08:25.739
but I got myself a hot dog

08:25.739 --> 08:28.108
to feel better and I just wanted
to say thanks for the cash.

08:28.108 --> 08:30.310
-What cash?
-The hundred you slipped
in my bag.

08:30.310 --> 08:31.544
I mean, I'm gonna blow it

08:31.544 --> 08:33.847
all in the bodega,
but I appreciate it.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.648
I'll, uh, I'll call you
if I hear anything, okay?

08:35.648 --> 08:36.649
Love you.

08:36.649 --> 08:39.219
BOB (muttering):
Four, five, six.

08:39.219 --> 08:41.521
Eight, sixteen...

08:41.521 --> 08:43.189
Did you give my daughter money?

08:43.189 --> 08:45.759
Yes. Yeah.
You know, it's New York.

08:45.759 --> 08:49.529
I always tell my kids you gotta
have money for the muggers.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.765
What?

08:51.765 --> 08:54.067
Money for the muggers, you know,
if you get mugged,

08:54.067 --> 08:56.469
you gotta, you know, take
the money out, show them,

08:56.469 --> 08:58.905
throw it that way, and you run
the opposite direction.

08:58.905 --> 09:02.609
Why would you give
my adult daughter money?

09:02.609 --> 09:05.678
And why would you do that
without asking me first?

09:06.846 --> 09:10.283
I-I didn't even... I didn't even
think it was a thing.

09:10.283 --> 09:11.818
I mean, I didn't think that
was gonna be a problem.

09:11.818 --> 09:13.853
I'm so-- I...

09:13.853 --> 09:17.991
(sighs) You're right.
No. I should've definitely

09:17.991 --> 09:21.694
consulted with you on that.

09:21.694 --> 09:24.898
Yeah, I didn't. That's my bad.
I got "vane."

09:24.898 --> 09:26.866
I got "vane" here,
like a weather vane.

09:26.866 --> 09:29.702
That's 16 points.
That's pretty good.

09:29.702 --> 09:31.371
You're up.

09:32.472 --> 09:35.275
(phone buzzing)

09:35.275 --> 09:37.177
-Hello?
-NATHANIEL: Sammy Fink,

09:37.177 --> 09:38.244
what're you up to?

09:38.244 --> 09:39.712
Uh, you know, not much,

09:39.712 --> 09:41.581
just gonna walk around,
maybe buy a hot dog again.

09:41.581 --> 09:45.118
Oh, really? Ugh. Don't put that
crap in your body. It's not--

09:45.118 --> 09:47.253
Well, listen, not that
I monitor women's bodies.

09:47.253 --> 09:48.555
Eat whatever you want.

09:48.555 --> 09:50.723
I love all types. You know.

09:50.723 --> 09:53.793
Big, fat, skinny, Scandinavian.

09:53.793 --> 09:55.595
Um, anyway, listen,
some of us are going out later,

09:55.595 --> 09:56.763
you should join us.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.298
Oh, wow. Okay.

09:58.298 --> 09:59.466
-Uh, who's "us"?
-You know,

09:59.466 --> 10:01.134
like, just some
colleagues and some

10:01.134 --> 10:03.369
general office assholes.
You know, the kinda people

10:03.369 --> 10:06.673
you gotta vibe with
to get the job.

10:06.673 --> 10:09.109
Awesome, yeah. I will
definitely be there. Thank you.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.010
-Sweet. I'll send you
the details.
-Okay.

10:11.010 --> 10:12.345
Listen, just be yourself.

10:12.345 --> 10:15.849
All right? Not your old self,
uh, your new self.

10:15.849 --> 10:20.286
Uh, but not the new self
from today, just, you know...

10:20.286 --> 10:22.322
Focus on the fun parts and
don't worry about the sad stuff.

10:22.322 --> 10:23.423
-All right?
-Yeah.

10:23.423 --> 10:24.757
I'll see you tonight. Okay. Bye.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.762
So, my sobriety app isn't
a replacement for meetings,

10:29.762 --> 10:31.331
but it's a solution for those

10:31.331 --> 10:33.600
sometimes difficult times
in between.

10:33.600 --> 10:36.503
So not only will our users have
access to a social network

10:36.503 --> 10:38.505
tailored to
their recovery needs,

10:38.505 --> 10:40.507
but we have a tracking component

10:40.507 --> 10:44.010
that will bring us to
a new frontier in wellness.

10:44.010 --> 10:45.478

10:45.478 --> 10:49.315
Cool. Well, I look forward
to hearing from you guys...

10:49.315 --> 10:52.185
No, no need. I knew I wanted it
before you got here.

10:52.185 --> 10:53.786
How can we make this official?

10:54.954 --> 10:56.789
So, you wanna buy it?

10:56.789 --> 10:57.891
Yeah.

10:58.958 --> 11:00.160
Okay.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.328

or terrified.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.564

11:14.307 --> 11:15.775
Like, they have swelled up

11:15.775 --> 11:17.810

the injections.

11:17.810 --> 11:20.813
-Well, you look amazing.
-No, I don't.

11:24.150 --> 11:27.487

11:27.487 --> 11:30.523

get jawline breakouts.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.325

-It's medically advisable.
-And then also,
Joshy was in here,

11:40.533 --> 11:43.803

his song...

11:43.803 --> 11:46.306
♪ Joshy, I love you ♪

11:46.306 --> 11:48.408

11:56.516 --> 11:58.918
Or like he doesn't
recognize me anymore

11:58.918 --> 12:00.553
(crying):
because I'm fat.

12:00.553 --> 12:04.591
You're not fat.
That's crazy.

12:04.591 --> 12:07.794
-Baby, what is going on?
-I don't know.

12:07.794 --> 12:10.163
I don't know what's going on.

12:10.163 --> 12:13.066
-I mean, like,
are we ever gonna do this?
-Yes.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.068
-Of course. You're so close.
-Yeah,

12:15.068 --> 12:17.403
I'm so close. Are you?

12:20.673 --> 12:23.543
Yeah. So, like, the last
three miles of the marathon...

12:23.543 --> 12:26.246

but if you hydrate you're fine.

-Is that okay to say that?
-Thank you. Yeah.

12:40.326 --> 12:43.263
Everybody be cool.
This is Sam Fink,

12:43.263 --> 12:45.932
she's our top candidate
for the party reporter job.

12:45.932 --> 12:49.235
All right? So be nice, please.
Meaning...

12:49.235 --> 12:52.105
don't be yourselves,
ha-ha, ha-ha...

12:52.105 --> 12:55.074
So, that's cool. Sober, huh?

12:55.074 --> 12:58.411
-Yeah.
-You know, my brother's in
the program and he still rages.

12:58.411 --> 12:59.646
I mean, he used to be, like,

12:59.646 --> 13:01.080
way more fun
at Christmas parties

13:01.080 --> 13:02.081
when he drank, but...

13:02.081 --> 13:03.416
-Cool.
-Yeah.

13:03.416 --> 13:05.485
Yeah.

13:05.485 --> 13:07.320
So, I was just wondering...

13:07.320 --> 13:09.422
You just said "party reporter,"

13:09.422 --> 13:11.157
and I kind of thought
the job was like a...

13:11.157 --> 13:13.092
like a cultural events
type thing. Is the...?

13:13.092 --> 13:15.128
You know, it's like a combo.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.629
Like, you're writing,
but there's parties.

13:16.629 --> 13:19.165
-Cool.
-And Topher would do, like,

13:19.165 --> 13:20.333
-party stuff at bars.
-He would.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.635
-He was the last party reporter.
-Oh, cool.

13:22.635 --> 13:25.071
-Yeah.
-And so he always goes
to bars, and he was...

13:25.071 --> 13:27.373
So, what happened to--
what happened to Topher?

13:27.373 --> 13:29.309
Does he, like,
does he smell bad or...?

13:29.309 --> 13:31.244
-Oh, he was great.
-He was good.

13:31.244 --> 13:33.313
He was so great.
He just partied a little hard.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.615
So, you know, he'd get so wasted

13:35.615 --> 13:37.417
that he didn't turn stuff in
on time.

13:37.417 --> 13:40.086
Yeah, and you know, and
he-he lost custody of his kids.

13:40.086 --> 13:41.954
-It was pretty bad.
-Oof.

13:41.954 --> 13:44.957
But that's not a problem for you
'cause you had a bad girl phase

13:44.957 --> 13:46.626
and now that's
in the rearview, right?

13:46.626 --> 13:49.962
-Yeah.
-And now you're just like

13:51.030 --> 13:52.732

-But I...

13:52.732 --> 13:54.233
-We'll figure it out.
I don't want you...
-It's fine.

13:54.233 --> 13:57.270
-Yeah, for sure. Yeah.
-You're sure? Okay, good.

13:57.270 --> 13:59.539
So, where are you, uh,
living, anyway?

13:59.539 --> 14:02.475
-Uh, Malden.
-Okay, cool,

you don't actually share that
