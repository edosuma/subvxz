WEBVTT

00:02.089 --> 00:03.916
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Friends, we last left our Jane
saying goodbye

00:03.960 --> 00:07.355
to Michael and telling Rafael
she loved him. Only problem...

00:07.398 --> 00:09.052
It's just, it's too late.

00:09.096 --> 00:11.054
I just don't
trust you anymore, Jane.

00:11.098 --> 00:12.751
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Also too late
on the love train?

00:12.795 --> 00:14.231
Alba and her ex-boyfriend
Jorge.

00:14.275 --> 00:17.495
See, she married him so he could get his green card.

00:17.539 --> 00:19.802
Only problem:
she still loved him.

00:19.845 --> 00:22.022
I know, straight out
of a telenovela, right?

00:22.065 --> 00:23.371
Well, imagine this.

00:23.414 --> 00:25.547
Rogelio was starring
in the American remake

00:25.590 --> 00:27.070
ofThe Passions of Santos.

00:27.114 --> 00:28.680
And they finally shot
the pilot.

00:28.724 --> 00:31.379
And Petra?
She almost got shot as well.

00:31.422 --> 00:33.076
But J.R. saved her.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.251
Who is it? Who
did I just shoot?

00:34.295 --> 00:36.166
My ex-husband Milos.

00:36.210 --> 00:37.820
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And the happy couple
were on the up and up.

00:37.863 --> 00:40.475
Until... I didn't e-mail Milos.

00:40.518 --> 00:42.477
It's right here, Petra,
how you said you won't testify

00:42.520 --> 00:44.696
against him
if he gives you the hotel.

00:44.740 --> 00:46.785
I didn't write this.
I'm being set up.

00:46.829 --> 00:48.309
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And then this happened.

00:48.352 --> 00:50.876
Scary man.
He was just in our room.

00:50.920 --> 00:52.400
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And speaking of scary people,

00:52.443 --> 00:55.664
Rose, aka Sin Rostro,
was up to no good.

00:55.707 --> 00:57.579
We need to move up the timeline.

00:57.622 --> 01:00.060
I live just down
the hall, and...

01:00.103 --> 01:02.105
Would you like
to come in?

01:02.149 --> 01:04.107
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Poor Luisa. I can't watch.

01:04.151 --> 01:06.849
But you should. So let's see what happens next.

01:07.937 --> 01:09.982
When Jane Gloriana Villanueva

01:10.026 --> 01:11.506
was nine years old,

01:11.549 --> 01:13.551
she first fell in love with...

01:13.595 --> 01:15.118
reading.

01:15.162 --> 01:17.642
And because Jane loved love,

01:17.686 --> 01:18.991
she also fell in love with...

01:19.035 --> 01:20.515
historical nonfiction.

01:20.558 --> 01:22.038
Just kidding.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.605
Come on, guys.
You know this by now.

01:23.648 --> 01:25.607
Romance novels.

01:25.650 --> 01:27.696
What are you still doing up?

01:27.739 --> 01:30.002
It's bedtime.
Put the book away.

01:30.046 --> 01:31.526
Five more minutes, please?

01:31.569 --> 01:34.442
Nicholas is about to
propose to Francine.

01:34.485 --> 01:36.183
He's been
in love with her forever.

01:36.226 --> 01:38.620
And finally he won her over.

01:38.663 --> 01:41.536
You know that's not
really how it works, right?

01:41.579 --> 01:43.146
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
But actually, friends,

01:43.190 --> 01:44.626
for a long time,

01:44.669 --> 01:47.063
that is exactly
how it worked for Jane.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.152
With him. I'm a fighter.

01:49.196 --> 01:51.459
And him. I'm proposing.

01:52.590 --> 01:53.765
And even him.

01:53.809 --> 01:56.464
I am crazy about
this woman! Yeah.

01:56.507 --> 02:00.337
And then him again.
With a different name. I'm coming a-courtin'.

02:00.381 --> 02:02.339
And, yep, him again, too.

02:02.383 --> 02:05.342
All I want is to put
this ring on your finger.

02:05.386 --> 02:06.865
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
So, yes, friends.

02:06.909 --> 02:09.564
Love always came
easily to our Jane.

02:10.869 --> 02:13.524
That is, until it didn't.

02:19.704 --> 02:21.619
I just want to see
how Rafael is doing.

02:21.663 --> 02:23.273
He's completely avoiding me.

02:26.494 --> 02:28.670
He is.LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I'll let you be the judge.

02:28.713 --> 02:30.193
Hey!

02:30.237 --> 02:32.064
Where's your daddy?

02:32.108 --> 02:34.415
He said I'm a big boy
and can walk to the door myself.

02:41.770 --> 02:43.598
Hey there.

02:43.641 --> 02:45.948
Where's your daddy?Oh, he's avoiding you.

02:47.776 --> 02:49.560
It's so frustrating.

02:49.604 --> 02:51.693
How long is this gonna go on?

02:53.782 --> 02:55.653
But he's gonna come around
eventually, right?

02:55.697 --> 02:57.177
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
He has to, right?

02:58.961 --> 03:00.571
But this is a telenovela!

03:13.323 --> 03:15.847
Yeah.

03:15.891 --> 03:18.502
Okay. I know.

03:18.546 --> 03:19.764
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which brings us...

03:19.808 --> 03:22.637
Wait. What is Jane doing
at Rafael's?

03:22.680 --> 03:25.596
Remember, Jane, boundaries.

03:25.640 --> 03:28.295
Well, at least
she's not texting him.

03:29.731 --> 03:31.254
Oh, come on.

03:44.311 --> 03:45.964
Oh.

04:00.979 --> 04:03.112
JANE:
I'm so embarrassed.

04:03.155 --> 04:04.983
I made a complete
fool of myself.

04:05.027 --> 04:06.550
But it's an
impossible situation.

04:06.594 --> 04:07.856
I mean, he can't just

04:07.899 --> 04:10.206
cut me out of his
life completely.
I agree...

04:10.250 --> 04:11.990
We're co-parents, you know?
What if there's an emergency?

04:12.034 --> 04:13.427
Well, then...You know, something
serious with Mateo.

04:13.470 --> 04:14.602
We got to be able
to communicate.

04:14.645 --> 04:17.953
Can we communicate?
Let me talk.

04:17.996 --> 04:19.737
He's a great father.

04:19.781 --> 04:22.000
I-If there was an emergency,
he'd call.

04:22.044 --> 04:23.785
Yeah, based on
how he's acting?

04:23.828 --> 04:25.395
How can I be sure?

04:25.439 --> 04:28.833
Hon, you're just looking
for a hole to crawl through.

04:28.877 --> 04:29.965
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Better than crawling

04:30.008 --> 04:31.271
through one
of Rafael's windows.

04:31.314 --> 04:33.229
I really think you should
back off for a while.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.753
ROGELIO:
No! Dead?

04:35.797 --> 04:37.320
How could that be?

04:37.364 --> 04:40.454
Why, God, why?

04:40.497 --> 04:41.846
Oh, no.

04:41.890 --> 04:44.806
Who died? I-Is it your mom?
Your dad?

04:44.849 --> 04:46.155
My pilot.

04:46.198 --> 04:47.765
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
To be fair,

04:47.809 --> 04:49.637
Rogelio has spent much more
time with his pilot

04:49.680 --> 04:51.203
than with his parents lately.

04:51.247 --> 04:52.553
What happened?

04:52.596 --> 04:53.728
Well, I don't know.

04:53.771 --> 04:55.164
The network passed.

04:55.207 --> 04:56.426
It's crazy...

04:56.470 --> 04:58.733
but I'm going to confront
those executives.

04:58.776 --> 05:00.735
And I'm going to give them
a piece of my mind.

05:00.778 --> 05:03.172
And I'm not going to hold back!

05:03.215 --> 05:05.479
In telling you how much
I respect you

05:05.522 --> 05:07.872
and your opinions,
because I do.

05:07.916 --> 05:10.048
But I just don't understand
why don't you like

05:10.092 --> 05:12.747
the future Emmy award-winning
masterpiece

05:12.790 --> 05:15.184
that is The Passions
of Steve and Brenda?

05:15.227 --> 05:16.707
Look, we loved the idea

05:16.751 --> 05:18.927
of doing a big,
broad telenovela.

05:18.970 --> 05:20.668
But at the end of the day,

05:20.711 --> 05:24.280
well, it was a little too
conventional, actually.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.761
Let's make love
and then invade Switzerland.

05:30.155 --> 05:32.549
They've been neutral
for far too long.

05:32.593 --> 05:34.725
It feels like a
puffed-up soap opera.

05:34.769 --> 05:36.379
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Your point?

05:36.423 --> 05:38.120
In today's 500-show
peak TV world,

05:38.163 --> 05:39.687
it just doesn't stand out.

05:39.730 --> 05:41.906
Viewers today want
something edgy,

05:41.950 --> 05:43.560
just a little confusing,

05:43.604 --> 05:44.909
shadowy and dark
with shocking twists.

05:44.953 --> 05:46.911
Sci-fi elements are also big.

05:46.955 --> 05:48.696
Right. And assassins.

05:48.739 --> 05:50.306
Okay. Done.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.090
What's done?
All of that.

05:52.134 --> 05:53.135
I'll do it.

05:53.178 --> 05:54.919
I will come back
with a new proposal,

05:54.963 --> 05:56.878
with every single one
of your ideas incorporated.

05:56.921 --> 05:57.922
You don't need to pay me.

05:57.966 --> 05:59.359
Just promise me you'll read it.

05:59.402 --> 06:00.751
Please.

06:00.795 --> 06:02.449
This is my passion project,
as you know.

06:02.492 --> 06:05.974
Look, the-the truth
is, there's one more note

06:06.017 --> 06:08.629
we haven't told you.
And this one's, um...

06:08.672 --> 06:10.326
well, it's, it's definitely
the biggest.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.850
Whatever it is.
I'll make it so.

06:12.894 --> 06:14.330
It's about the stars.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.854
What about us?

06:16.898 --> 06:19.466
We actually need
them to be younger.

06:22.077 --> 06:25.036
How young are we talking?

06:25.080 --> 06:26.821
You're six years old. It's
time to start eating broccoli.

06:26.864 --> 06:28.997
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ugh. Broccoli.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.652
If I eat my broccoli, can
I have ice cream after?

06:31.695 --> 06:33.001
Uh, no bargaining.

06:33.044 --> 06:34.306
Daddy let me trade.

06:34.350 --> 06:36.657
Oh, yeah?

06:36.700 --> 06:38.441
How's your daddy doing?

06:38.485 --> 06:40.617
Better than me 'cause he doesn't
have to eat broccoli.

06:40.661 --> 06:45.840
But I mean, does he seem
happy or sad?
Regular.

06:45.883 --> 06:48.625
Oh.I bet he'll bring me
some ice cream tomorrow

06:48.669 --> 06:49.931
when he comes to school.

06:49.974 --> 06:51.672
Oh, he's coming
to school tomorrow?

06:51.715 --> 06:52.890
For the book fair.

06:52.934 --> 06:56.024
Oh. Good to know.

06:56.067 --> 06:58.330
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Uh-oh. Looks like Jane's wheels are spinning.

06:58.374 --> 07:00.332
GPS VOICE:
Turn right on Fremont Avenue.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.510
Make a U-turn.

07:03.553 --> 07:05.033
Why would I make a U-turn?

07:05.076 --> 07:06.948
Because you need to turn around
and go home.

07:06.991 --> 07:08.645
You have no business driving
to Mateo's school

07:08.689 --> 07:09.777
for the book fair.

07:09.820 --> 07:11.822
I'm serious, Jane.

07:11.866 --> 07:14.564
You need to take your mom's
advice and back off.

07:14.608 --> 07:17.741
You're acting cray.

07:21.179 --> 07:23.181
Good.
Now head on home.

07:26.054 --> 07:29.144
Seriously?
What are you doing?

07:29.187 --> 07:32.669
Oh, no. You can't turn me off,
sister. You're stalking him.

07:32.713 --> 07:34.671
You need to turn around
because you're steering

07:34.715 --> 07:37.021
into restraining order
territory.

07:40.851 --> 07:42.505
Hey there.RAFAEL :
Hi. Listen,

07:42.549 --> 07:44.420
I'm at Mateo's school
for the book fair,

07:44.464 --> 07:46.378
and when I got here,
there was a problem.

07:46.422 --> 07:47.554
What kind of problem?

07:47.597 --> 07:48.903
He had a meltdown

07:48.946 --> 07:50.208
and had to be taken
out of class.

07:50.252 --> 07:52.080
I think a kid said
something mean to him.

07:52.123 --> 07:53.081
He was crying,

07:53.124 --> 07:55.300
saying that he was a dummy.

07:55.344 --> 07:56.301
What?

07:56.345 --> 07:57.607
I know.

07:57.651 --> 07:59.217
I'm gonna talk to the teacher,

07:59.261 --> 08:01.437
but I just,
I wanted to tell you.

08:01.481 --> 08:06.007
Uh, yeah, you know, um, I happen
to be close by, so wait for me.

08:06.050 --> 08:07.791
I-I'll come by
and talk to her, too.

08:07.835 --> 08:09.140
Okay, sure.
What's your, uh, ETA?

08:09.184 --> 08:10.838
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, about 30 seconds.

08:10.881 --> 08:12.927
I'll be there really soon.

08:12.970 --> 08:16.060
The good news is Mateo
calmed down. He's back in class.

08:16.104 --> 08:18.585
He told us that Simon
called him a dummy

08:18.628 --> 08:20.543
and said that he was stupid.

08:20.587 --> 08:24.895
I know, and I spoke with Simon,
and that won't happen again.

08:24.939 --> 08:26.941
And I'm also gonna speak
to Simon's parents as well.

08:26.984 --> 08:28.943
Thank you.
Maybe Simon was insecure

08:28.986 --> 08:31.946
about his performance in school,
so he took it out on Mateo?

08:31.989 --> 08:34.035
Mm, that's one possibility.

08:34.078 --> 08:35.558
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
But judging by her tone,
not the right one.

08:35.602 --> 08:39.736
Look, I actually think
this incident

08:39.780 --> 08:41.346
might have stemmed
from the fact

08:41.390 --> 08:45.176
that Mateo is really struggling
with his reading.

08:45.220 --> 08:47.570
He is quite far behind
the rest of the class.

08:47.614 --> 08:50.007
Mateo's behind?

08:50.051 --> 08:53.010
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Wow. Jane really read
that situation wrong.

08:57.754 --> 09:00.627
Uh, so most of the class
is reading by now?

09:00.670 --> 09:03.238
Yes, most are. But there's
nothing to worry about.

09:03.281 --> 09:05.414
Most kids eventually
catch up.

09:05.457 --> 09:08.286
But I like to see a little more
letter recognition

09:08.330 --> 09:10.898
and, uh, you know,
a few sight words at this point.

09:10.941 --> 09:13.291
Okay, so what do we do?
How can we help?

09:13.335 --> 09:14.292
I wouldn't
pressure him.

09:14.336 --> 09:15.859
Just read a lot
to him.

09:15.903 --> 09:18.122
Play word games.
Just engage him.

09:18.166 --> 09:20.385
Okay. Got it.

09:20.429 --> 09:22.170
Yes, absolutely.
Thank you.

09:24.346 --> 09:27.131
I had no idea
that Mateo was behind.

09:27.175 --> 09:28.916
Me neither.

09:28.959 --> 09:30.395
How could we
have missed this?

09:30.439 --> 09:35.313
Well, things have been
a little... crazy.

09:35.357 --> 09:36.924
You know, with your husband
coming back

09:36.967 --> 09:38.186
from the dead and all.

09:38.229 --> 09:39.796
Hmm.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.406
Look, I'm sorry for creeping
around your apartment before.

09:41.450 --> 09:43.408
That was...Oh, don't worry about it.

09:43.452 --> 09:46.629
We should put it behind us
and focus on Mateo.

09:47.978 --> 09:51.242
We're a good team.
We can get him there.

09:51.286 --> 09:52.896
Yeah.

09:52.940 --> 09:55.595
Plus, I think it's better
that we know.

09:55.638 --> 09:58.162
You're right. We couldn't help
him if we were in the dark.

09:58.206 --> 10:02.210
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Although some people prefer
being in the dark.

10:02.253 --> 10:05.605
Okay, this is super hot,

10:05.648 --> 10:07.911
but I have to ask:

10:07.955 --> 10:10.044
why are we in a closet?

10:10.087 --> 10:11.915
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yeah. These two came out
a while ago.

10:11.959 --> 10:14.135
I got new security cameras,

10:14.178 --> 10:16.224
so, unless you want to give
the security guy downstairs

10:16.267 --> 10:18.226
a peep show,
this is the only blind spot.

10:18.269 --> 10:21.229
All right, so you put cameras
in your own bedroom?

10:21.272 --> 10:23.361
I need to find out
which one of Milos's goons

10:23.405 --> 10:25.363
is harassing us, so life
can just go back to normal.

10:25.407 --> 10:28.845
ELLIE:
Mommy? Where are you?

10:28.889 --> 10:31.761
Shoot. The girls are back.

10:31.805 --> 10:33.633
They're early.
I'm sorry.

10:33.676 --> 10:35.460
Okay.

10:36.461 --> 10:39.247
Hey!Mommy, we missed you.

10:39.290 --> 10:40.640
Can we sleep here tonight?

10:40.683 --> 10:42.729
Oh, not yet, girls.
You'll stay with your daddy

10:42.772 --> 10:44.426
until we figure out
who was out on the balcony.

10:44.469 --> 10:46.254
Can you come, too?

10:46.297 --> 10:48.212
To your father's?
What for?

10:48.256 --> 10:50.475
So the scary man
doesn't get you.

10:50.519 --> 10:52.260
Oh, no, I'm perfectly safe.

10:52.303 --> 10:55.089
Look, J.R.'s here.

10:55.132 --> 10:56.438
Girls, say hello.

10:56.481 --> 10:59.659
It's okay. Um, I think
the girls could use

10:59.702 --> 11:01.748
some alone time
with their mommy.

11:01.791 --> 11:04.489
I've got some things
to do anyway.

11:04.533 --> 11:06.187
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yeah, she couldn't get out

11:06.230 --> 11:07.188
of there fast enough.

11:07.231 --> 11:09.277
Slow down, Ma.

11:09.320 --> 11:12.062
I'm feeling better, but
I'm not ready to sprint.

11:12.106 --> 11:14.456
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Can I just say it's nice to see

11:14.499 --> 11:15.631
Xo on the mend.

11:17.502 --> 11:20.505
Let's sit for a minute
so I can catch my breath.

11:22.986 --> 11:25.641
So, what's going on?

11:43.267 --> 11:44.355
Are you guys studying?

11:49.186 --> 11:53.713
You also nervous about spending
all that time with Jorge?

12:01.982 --> 12:04.549
I know, right? She is not
used to being turned down.

12:07.161 --> 12:09.119
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
No way. Can't be.

12:09.163 --> 12:10.599
I don't know.

12:26.789 --> 12:28.486
You got this, Mom.

12:31.185 --> 12:33.056
I got this.

12:34.928 --> 12:37.408
Again, way too fast.

12:37.452 --> 12:39.062
Again, take your time.

12:39.106 --> 12:41.456
But this is so boring.

12:41.499 --> 12:43.719
Well, if you focus
we'll be done sooner.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.548
Now, come on,
what's the first letter?"R."

12:46.591 --> 12:48.680
Great. Now stretch it out
like a rubber band.

12:48.724 --> 12:50.770
Hey! What was that?

12:50.813 --> 12:52.119
I'm being a black belt.

12:52.162 --> 12:54.730
No karate-chopping the card.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.340
Now, can you stretch it out?

12:56.384 --> 12:57.559
No.

12:57.602 --> 13:01.128
Okay, I'll give you a hint.

13:01.171 --> 13:03.217
The word rhymes with "Ted."

13:04.392 --> 13:06.437
Come on, rhyming is fun.

13:06.481 --> 13:07.917
You like Dr. Seuss, right?

13:07.961 --> 13:09.745
He's got a black belt
in rhyming.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.660
Yes, karate. Hi-yah!

13:11.703 --> 13:13.401
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Sorry, but you kind of

13:13.444 --> 13:14.402
asked for it, Jane.

13:14.445 --> 13:16.273
Okay, the word is "red."

13:16.317 --> 13:18.841
Red, Ted, said.
See how they all rhyme?

13:18.885 --> 13:21.583
I can't do it.

13:21.626 --> 13:22.976
Yes, you can.

13:23.019 --> 13:25.021
You just have
to believe in yourself

13:25.065 --> 13:26.631
and keep trying,
even if it's hard.

13:26.675 --> 13:27.763
Huh?

13:27.807 --> 13:30.679
What rhymes with "sit"?

13:30.722 --> 13:31.898
I quit!

13:31.941 --> 13:33.856
I thought I could take
the network's notes,

13:33.900 --> 13:34.857
but it's impossible.

13:34.901 --> 13:36.424
How come he gets to quit?

13:36.467 --> 13:37.425
He doesn't.

13:37.468 --> 13:38.643
I did.Well, that's ridiculous.

13:38.687 --> 13:40.254
You're not gonna quit, Dad,

13:40.297 --> 13:41.472
and neither are you, Mateo,

13:41.516 --> 13:42.996
because the Villanueva-
de-la-Vega-Solanos

13:43.039 --> 13:44.258
aren't quitters.

13:44.301 --> 13:47.478
But what they want is too hard.

13:47.522 --> 13:49.393
Nothing is too hard.

13:49.437 --> 13:51.569
Mateo, I know reading
seems hard,

13:51.613 --> 13:53.963
but when you learn to do it,
it's gonna be as fun as karate.

13:54.007 --> 13:55.443
I promise.

13:55.486 --> 13:57.488
And, Dad, you've worked
too hard to give up.

13:57.532 --> 13:59.403
This isn't The Passions of Steve and Brenda.

13:59.447 --> 14:01.666
This is the passions
of Rogelio!

14:01.710 --> 14:02.885
You know, as hard
as it seems,

14:02.929 --> 14:05.148
we have to rise
to the challenge.

14:05.192 --> 14:06.976
Do you really think
it's possible?

14:07.020 --> 14:08.499
Of course.

14:08.543 --> 14:10.937
So, will you write
the proposal

14:10.980 --> 14:13.504
for the new version
of Steve and Brenda? Hmm?

14:13.548 --> 14:15.942
One that incorporates
all of their notes

14:15.985 --> 14:18.379
and still stars River and me,

14:18.422 --> 14:21.556
and also younger people
who think they're the stars.

14:21.599 --> 14:23.558
Dad, I don't think I'm
the best person for that.

14:23.601 --> 14:27.518
Come on, who's better than
the father-daughter dream team

14:27.562 --> 14:29.738
who got me a Paloma nomination?

14:29.781 --> 14:31.958
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And no one else
would take the job.

14:32.001 --> 14:34.482
What do you say, Jane?
Will you do it?

14:37.615 --> 14:38.834
You know what, yes.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.705
As hard as it seems,
I will write the proposal,

14:40.749 --> 14:42.490
because I rise to a challenge.

14:42.533 --> 14:44.187
This is gonna be great.

14:44.231 --> 14:45.232
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
That's up for debate.

15:18.656 --> 15:20.267
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Nice boundary-respecting, Jane.

15:31.060 --> 15:32.932
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Okay, well, that's just kismet.

16:06.530 --> 16:08.402
Ah...

17:23.129 --> 17:25.305
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I'd say
that's impressive at your age,

17:25.348 --> 17:27.611
even if it's make-believe.

17:33.574 --> 17:35.489
Do what, Mom?
What's wrong?

17:41.756 --> 17:43.323
You won't screw up.

17:51.809 --> 17:52.984
Then don't do it alone.

17:53.028 --> 17:54.421
I'll help you guys.

17:54.464 --> 17:56.597
And whenever your feelings
begin to take over,

17:56.640 --> 17:58.773
just squeeze my hand... okay?

17:58.816 --> 18:01.254
Okay.

18:01.297 --> 18:03.299
ROGELIO:
Together, we are unstoppable.

18:03.343 --> 18:05.127
So, here's what I'm
thinking, you know.

18:05.171 --> 18:06.563
The network wants
younger leads,

18:06.607 --> 18:08.609
so the obvious solution
would be to hire

18:08.652 --> 18:11.786
the best CGI guys in Hollywood
and age me down.

18:11.829 --> 18:14.484
Like Brad Pitt
in Benjamin Button.

18:18.662 --> 18:19.837
River can play my mother.

18:19.881 --> 18:24.625
America's first
mother/son co-presidents.

18:24.668 --> 18:28.629
That is definitely an...
an idea.

18:28.672 --> 18:30.457
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
But, judging by her tone,
not the right one.

18:30.500 --> 18:33.373
But you know,
since we're spitballing,

18:33.416 --> 18:35.853
in the book that I'm writing,
I go back and forth

18:35.897 --> 18:37.638
between the past
and the present,

18:37.681 --> 18:39.988
with younger and older versions
of all my characters.

18:40.031 --> 18:43.513
Yeah, flashbacks just
don't have the "wow" factor.

18:43.557 --> 18:44.601
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Hey...

18:44.645 --> 18:46.168
I'm not talking about
flashbacks.

18:46.212 --> 18:48.214
I'm talking about
multiple timelines.

18:48.257 --> 18:50.520
You and River can play
Steve and Brenda in the present,

18:50.564 --> 18:53.306
and the two younger leads
can play you guys in the past.

18:53.349 --> 18:56.700
We'll cut back and forth
between the past and present.

18:56.744 --> 18:58.833
I guess it could work
in a novel,

18:58.876 --> 19:00.704
but I don't want this to be
a boring book.

19:00.748 --> 19:03.011
No offense.

19:03.054 --> 19:04.273
Some taken.

19:04.317 --> 19:05.666
And it's not gonna be
like a boring book.

19:05.709 --> 19:07.885
It's gonna be more like
that TV show This Is Us.

19:07.929 --> 19:09.974
Oh, I love This Is Us.

19:10.018 --> 19:12.586
And I'm good friends
with Justin Hartley.

19:14.588 --> 19:16.807
ROGELIO: You know,
I am also a big star,

19:16.851 --> 19:19.549
so I know how hard
it is to go out

19:19.593 --> 19:20.855
and constantly get noticed,

19:20.898 --> 19:22.509
and have people talk
to you like they know you.

19:24.598 --> 19:25.555
Justin, right?

19:25.599 --> 19:27.601
Rogelio De La Vega.

19:27.644 --> 19:30.647
Just wanted to say hello,
one celebrity to another.

19:32.171 --> 19:37.176
You know, I find a nice,
full-body wax in advance

19:37.219 --> 19:39.656
really helps a tan soak in.

19:39.700 --> 19:41.528
Sugar wax or resin?

19:41.571 --> 19:43.965
Maybe Hartley can make a cameo.

19:44.008 --> 19:45.140
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yeah, right.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.750
Hartley doesn't do cameos.

19:46.794 --> 19:48.796
I'm in. Let's get started
on the proposal.

19:48.839 --> 19:51.625
Oh, actually, I have to be
at Raf's in 15 minutes

19:51.668 --> 19:53.061
for Mateo's study session.

19:53.104 --> 19:54.584
Why don't we get together
tomorrow night,

19:54.628 --> 19:55.759
and I'll give you
a rough draft?

19:55.803 --> 19:58.240
Okay. Well, go forth.
And remember...

19:58.284 --> 20:00.242
you're training
the third generation

20:00.286 --> 20:02.810
of De La Vega geniuses.

20:04.072 --> 20:05.378
Ball.

20:05.421 --> 20:07.684
Uh, bat.

20:07.728 --> 20:10.557
Uh, "T" sounds like "tuh."

20:10.600 --> 20:11.949
Mommy.
Hmm?

20:11.993 --> 20:13.255
What rhymes with bat?

20:13.299 --> 20:17.433
Bat, cat, sat.
Okay, your turn.

20:17.477 --> 20:18.782
Skip my turn.

20:18.826 --> 20:21.437
No, come on, Mr. Sweetface,
you can do it.

20:21.481 --> 20:24.353
Just one rhyme, and then
we'll take a break, okay?

20:24.397 --> 20:26.181
Heart.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.878
What other word
sounds like heart?

20:27.922 --> 20:29.619
RAFAEL :
Heart...

20:29.663 --> 20:32.666
Ha-art.

20:33.797 --> 20:35.712
Art?

20:35.756 --> 20:37.584
Art! Yes!Ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding!

20:37.627 --> 20:39.716
We have a winner!

20:39.760 --> 20:41.762
And fart.Fart!

20:41.805 --> 20:42.763
Yes. Yes!

20:42.806 --> 20:45.374
Heart, art, fart.

20:45.418 --> 20:47.289
Farty poopy pants.

20:47.333 --> 20:50.074
Well, that doesn't rhyme,
but farty party.

20:50.118 --> 20:51.075
And goopy poopy.

20:51.119 --> 20:52.294
And penis-teenis.

20:52.338 --> 20:54.688
Not really a word,
but it still rhymes.

20:54.731 --> 20:56.472
And now is a good time
to take a break.

20:56.516 --> 20:57.908
Cookie?Go ahead.

20:59.954 --> 21:03.305
So, maybe tomorrow
we can... grab breakfast.

21:03.349 --> 21:07.135
Just, um, us.
And talk.

21:08.702 --> 21:11.531
I work the morning shift
tomorrow. Can you do lunch?

21:11.574 --> 21:14.838
Can't. I have to get ready
for the open house on Fuller.

21:16.666 --> 21:18.581
We'll find another time.

21:18.625 --> 21:20.931
XIOMARA:
When, exactly?

21:20.975 --> 21:22.933
It was January,

21:22.977 --> 21:26.415
and I'd been working at
the gift shop for three months

21:26.459 --> 21:28.548
when Alba walked in.

21:33.553 --> 21:34.771
In English, Ma.

21:34.815 --> 21:36.773
Yes.

21:36.817 --> 21:41.517
Uh, Mrs. Cohen was
a mean old lady,

21:41.561 --> 21:42.953
but Jorge

21:42.997 --> 21:45.521
actually got her to smile.

21:45.565 --> 21:48.655
You have to hear this. Magical.

21:48.698 --> 21:50.657
Clearest ocean sound
you ever heard.

21:50.700 --> 21:52.702
Come on.

21:56.227 --> 21:59.448
ALBA:
He charmed us both that day.

22:01.494 --> 22:03.626
Good job.

22:03.670 --> 22:06.977
Jorge, how often are you
intimate with your wife?

22:09.284 --> 22:11.634
Two to three times a week.

22:11.678 --> 22:14.158
Impressive.LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
That's what I said.

22:15.725 --> 22:18.859
Alba, what would you say
is Jorge's greatest flaw?

22:20.817 --> 22:22.341
His pride.

22:22.384 --> 22:23.864
He won't admit it,

22:23.907 --> 22:28.695
but last week,
he loaded the dishwasher wrong

22:28.738 --> 22:30.740
and broke my
favorite dish.

22:39.793 --> 22:41.795
He's a very prideful man.

22:41.838 --> 22:44.711
Great answer, Ma. Very specific.

22:44.754 --> 22:46.669
You guys are
really nailing it.

22:46.713 --> 22:48.802
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Or finger-nailing it.

22:49.890 --> 22:51.413
Oh, hey, hon.Hey.

22:51.457 --> 22:52.719
We're just finishing up
our study session.

22:52.762 --> 22:53.720
Oh.How did yours go?

22:53.763 --> 22:55.199
Really good, actually.

22:55.243 --> 22:57.724
Uh, turns out, flatulence is key

22:57.767 --> 23:00.117
to maintaining Mateo's interest.
Now we know.

23:04.426 --> 23:06.820
And Raf and I are making plans
to get together.

23:06.863 --> 23:08.648
And it was his idea.

23:08.691 --> 23:10.780
Ah...

23:10.824 --> 23:13.783
That's really great,
but be careful.

23:13.827 --> 23:15.611
Oh, I've been careful, Ma,
my whole life.

23:15.655 --> 23:18.701
I don't want to be careful,
I want to be with Rafael.

23:18.745 --> 23:21.182
I love him and he loves me,
I know it.

23:21.225 --> 23:23.010
That doesn't just go away.

23:28.929 --> 23:31.235
PETRA: Stay over tonight?LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Plus side of having

23:31.279 --> 23:32.672
a psycho on the loose
at the hotel?

23:32.715 --> 23:34.108
The girls are sleeping
at their dad's again,

23:34.151 --> 23:36.415
so maybe come back,
or I'll come to you and then...

23:39.156 --> 23:40.941
I-I'll call you back.

23:42.246 --> 23:43.813
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
What language is that?

23:43.857 --> 23:46.076
Let me check. Oh, it is Czech.

23:46.120 --> 23:48.252
Oh, sorry.
You don't speak Czech.

23:50.907 --> 23:52.518
Hurry, Petra.

23:52.561 --> 23:55.912
Looks like our psycho's
been caught red-handed.

23:57.523 --> 23:59.481
Or, I guess, red-feathered.

23:59.525 --> 24:00.743
Call the police, now.

24:05.487 --> 24:07.881
We're back!
Oh, my girls,

24:07.924 --> 24:09.143
I'm so happy you're home.

24:09.186 --> 24:10.623
So are we.

24:10.666 --> 24:12.276
We missed our silk sheets.

24:12.320 --> 24:14.844
And our lavender bubble baths.

24:14.888 --> 24:17.847
Daddy's isn't organic.

24:20.850 --> 24:22.504
So, Pammy the Parrot?

24:22.548 --> 24:24.767
Really?Yes, the bird was compromised.

24:24.811 --> 24:26.552
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Total cuckoo.

24:26.595 --> 24:28.902
She denies it, but her time
cards put her at the hotel

24:28.945 --> 24:29.990
when each
of the incidents happened.

24:30.033 --> 24:31.818
I had her arrested.

24:31.861 --> 24:34.429
I guess you could say,
she clipped her wings.

24:34.473 --> 24:37.040
Put her in a cage,
on account of her fowl play...

24:37.084 --> 24:38.520
Yeah, but enough with the bird. Noted.

24:38.564 --> 24:41.697
The point is,
the danger is gone, thank God.

24:41.741 --> 24:43.873
On to the next disaster.ANNA: Mommy!

24:43.917 --> 24:45.832
Can we order room service?

24:45.875 --> 24:47.398
Of course. Whatever you want.

24:47.442 --> 24:49.052
The world is your oyster today.

24:49.096 --> 24:51.011
BOTH:
Ooh, oysters.

24:51.054 --> 24:53.274
You know who else
loves oysters? J.R.

24:53.317 --> 24:54.884
And she's coming over
for dinner tonight.

24:54.928 --> 24:56.843
All right,
say goodbye to your daddy.

24:56.886 --> 24:58.453
Come on.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.455
Mm.

25:03.676 --> 25:06.287
I want to spend time
with you alone, Jane.

25:06.330 --> 25:08.332
Just the two of us.

25:08.376 --> 25:11.161
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Get back
to the telenovela, Jane.

25:11.205 --> 25:15.122
Telenovela, telenovela,
telenovela.

25:39.407 --> 25:41.365
Okay, the big epic gesture.

25:41.409 --> 25:42.671
Think, Jane.

25:54.814 --> 25:56.859
Hey, Dad.

25:56.903 --> 25:59.427
Jane, my sensational scribe.

25:59.470 --> 26:01.429
Just wanted to check in
and make sure you got my text

26:01.472 --> 26:03.605
about how important
the romantic gesture is.

26:03.649 --> 26:05.085
Yep, I got it.

26:05.128 --> 26:06.477
Good. Because it has to be

26:06.521 --> 26:08.001
the thing
that changes everything.

26:08.044 --> 26:11.482
So think epic. Huge! Monumental.

26:11.526 --> 26:12.614
Understood.

26:12.658 --> 26:14.747
But also make it
small and personal.

26:14.790 --> 26:17.097
Huge but small. Got it.

26:17.140 --> 26:18.402
Of course you do.

26:18.446 --> 26:20.317
Now, go forth and write,
my talented daughter.

26:20.361 --> 26:22.319
Oops.

26:22.363 --> 26:23.973
You're also
my talented daughter.

26:24.017 --> 26:25.322
Bye, Dad.

26:31.633 --> 26:35.071
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, her own romantic hero.

26:35.115 --> 26:37.596
Talk about worlds colliding.

27:01.663 --> 27:03.622
And friends, in that moment,

27:03.665 --> 27:06.712
Jane knew exactly
what she had to do.

27:09.192 --> 27:11.194
I remembered where you said
you hide the keys

27:11.238 --> 27:13.196
from when I helped you
stage that apartment.

27:13.240 --> 27:14.458
I know tomorrow's open house
is a big deal,

27:14.502 --> 27:15.764
so I thought I'd help again.

27:15.808 --> 27:17.897
And I wanted
to make a gesture

27:17.940 --> 27:20.464
to say I love you, Rafael,
so much.

27:20.508 --> 27:22.771
And I want to remind you
of what we have,

27:22.815 --> 27:24.468
and how we can't
just give up on...

27:24.512 --> 27:26.166
Oh...

27:26.209 --> 27:30.823
Jane, this is my boss, Garret.

27:32.651 --> 27:35.218
Our clients weren't
available tomorrow,

27:35.262 --> 27:38.134
so we're showing them
the property today.

27:38.178 --> 27:40.397
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. Let me
just get out of your hair.

27:40.441 --> 27:41.877
Do you have romantic dates
in all the houses

27:41.921 --> 27:43.226
we're trying to sell?

27:43.270 --> 27:45.620
No, sir, I-I promise
that I would...

27:45.664 --> 27:47.709
You and your girlfriend need to
leave. I'll take it from here.

27:52.105 --> 27:54.107
I am so sorry.What the hell were you thinking?

27:54.150 --> 27:55.543
I thought that you were
gonna be alone,

27:55.586 --> 27:57.240
and I just wanted to make
a grand romantic gesture

27:57.284 --> 27:59.416
because there was an opening.What opening?

27:59.460 --> 28:01.027
Well, we were texting,

28:01.070 --> 28:03.029
and you invited me out alone.

28:03.072 --> 28:05.814
Because I wanted to talk about
Mateo without him overhearing.

28:05.858 --> 28:07.642
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Guess Mateo isn't the only one

28:07.686 --> 28:09.252
reading things wrong
these days.

28:09.296 --> 28:10.558
I'm so sorry. I misunderstood.

28:10.601 --> 28:12.081
I-I'll fix this.

28:12.125 --> 28:13.648
What's your boss's name?Stop, stop, stop.

28:13.692 --> 28:14.997
It's not for you to fix.

28:15.041 --> 28:16.172
Maybe I wasn't
clear before,

28:16.216 --> 28:19.132
but let me be
perfectly clear now:

28:19.175 --> 28:20.960
breakfast was never
supposed to be a date.

28:21.003 --> 28:23.136
And today?
I was just trying to do my job.

28:23.179 --> 28:24.224
And when I said
that we're a team,

28:24.267 --> 28:26.182
I didn't mean romantically.

28:26.226 --> 28:28.184
I am trying to be
a good co-parent.

28:28.228 --> 28:29.403
But you and I?

28:29.446 --> 28:30.926
Jane, we are through.

28:30.970 --> 28:33.189
So you need
to move on.

28:41.807 --> 28:43.765
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
We last left Jane having made
an epic gesture,

28:43.809 --> 28:47.073
which turned out to be
an epic failure.

28:47.116 --> 28:49.989
Just mortifying, for both of us.

28:50.032 --> 28:52.252
Oh, I feel horrible. I
don't know what to do, Mom.

28:52.295 --> 28:54.123
Well, you don't really
have a choice.

28:54.167 --> 28:55.429
Leave him alone.

28:55.472 --> 28:58.040
But I love him.

28:58.084 --> 29:00.303
And he's making a mistake.

29:00.347 --> 29:02.741
Can you even hear yourself?
Just because you love someone

29:02.784 --> 29:05.134
doesn't mean
you get to have them.

29:05.178 --> 29:06.875
Imagine if the roles
were reversed

29:06.919 --> 29:08.964
and you were a man
acting like this.

29:09.008 --> 29:10.183
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ooh, yes, let's.

29:21.585 --> 29:23.544
Oh, come on.

29:23.587 --> 29:26.547
I just wanted to say hi!

29:26.590 --> 29:29.376
Maybe a quick peek?

29:29.419 --> 29:31.160
I'm never giving up!

29:31.204 --> 29:33.946
Yeah, okay. I-I guess
when you put it that way,

29:33.989 --> 29:35.643
I was a little... Creepy?

29:35.686 --> 29:37.166
Overbearing.

29:37.210 --> 29:39.168
I know how hard it is,

29:39.212 --> 29:43.346
but you can't force someone
to feel something they don't.

29:43.390 --> 29:48.177
I just don't believe,
in my heart, that it's over.

29:48.221 --> 29:51.702
You don't have to believe it,
but you have to accept it.

29:53.008 --> 29:55.228
You're right.

29:55.271 --> 29:57.578
I'll leave him alone.

30:02.452 --> 30:04.454
Alba...
Hmm?

30:23.604 --> 30:26.041
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Okay, friends, let's do this.

30:26.085 --> 30:28.827
All right. Tell me about
your husband's family.

30:28.870 --> 30:32.091
Well, uh,
he has an older sister,

30:32.134 --> 30:34.397
and he's very close with...

30:34.441 --> 30:36.225
God. He's always been

30:36.269 --> 30:38.445
a big presence
in my wife's life.

30:38.488 --> 30:39.794
She loves...

30:39.838 --> 30:41.796
Spicy cheese puffs.

30:41.840 --> 30:46.409
I think they are disgusting, but
Jorge can't get enough of them.

30:46.453 --> 30:49.325
I don't think
there's anyone else...

30:49.369 --> 30:54.243
Who I could work with all day,
and live with,

30:54.287 --> 30:58.813
and still feel like I never
have enough time with.

30:58.857 --> 31:01.990
And she can read me so well.
She's not afraid to call me out

31:02.034 --> 31:06.821
on my stubbornness, like when
I load the dishwasher wrong

31:06.865 --> 31:08.779
and won't admit it.

31:08.823 --> 31:12.783
And she's the most generous
person I know.

31:12.827 --> 31:14.873
She always puts
her feelings aside,

31:14.916 --> 31:18.006
even when other people
are just being prideful.

31:18.050 --> 31:21.270
I never imagined

31:21.314 --> 31:24.883
I would be lucky enough
to have a wife like her.

31:27.929 --> 31:30.845
I cannot wait
to read what you wrote.

31:30.889 --> 31:33.282
Should I be prepared
to have my mind blown,

31:33.326 --> 31:34.762
my socks knocked off?

31:34.805 --> 31:36.416
Oh, uh...
Oh!

31:36.459 --> 31:38.853
Both! Should I read
the proposal aloud

31:38.897 --> 31:40.376
to maximize dramatic impact?

31:40.420 --> 31:42.596
I do a great Brenda.

31:42.639 --> 31:45.512
Actually, I haven't
written it yet.

31:45.555 --> 31:47.644
What?

31:47.688 --> 31:48.776
I'm so sorry.

31:48.819 --> 31:50.473
It's just been a crazy day.

31:50.517 --> 31:51.779
What happened?

31:51.822 --> 31:53.868
I thought you were writing.I was.

31:53.912 --> 31:56.175
But then I decided to make
a grand gesture to Rafael

31:56.218 --> 31:58.438
which went horribly wrong.

31:58.481 --> 32:01.006
So you just blew it off?

32:01.049 --> 32:03.486
I'm so sorry. I'll write it
by tomorrow, I promise.

32:03.530 --> 32:05.924
Jane, this show
is everything to me.

32:05.967 --> 32:07.273
My entire
American career

32:07.316 --> 32:09.057
is riding on it.

32:09.101 --> 32:10.972
The passions of Rogelio.

32:11.016 --> 32:12.495
That's what you said.

32:12.539 --> 32:13.975
I know.

32:14.019 --> 32:15.150
I'm so sorry, Dad.

32:17.022 --> 32:18.937
I'm just really disappointed.

32:22.201 --> 32:23.637
PETRA:
I feel bad.

32:23.680 --> 32:24.943
I wish we could go out to eat,

32:24.986 --> 32:26.857
but I don't want
to be too far from the girls.

32:26.901 --> 32:28.947
No, it's understandable.

32:28.990 --> 32:31.645
It's not like we're
slumming it here.

32:31.688 --> 32:33.864
I'm just glad we can
finally get back to normal.

32:33.908 --> 32:35.431
Me, too.

32:40.828 --> 32:42.351
Oh, my God. Get down! Gun!What?

32:42.395 --> 32:45.441
What?!I got to get
to the girls.

32:47.487 --> 32:49.010
Oh, thank God.

32:53.493 --> 32:55.016
Hello?

32:55.060 --> 32:57.366
Mrs. Solano? There's something
you should see.

32:57.410 --> 32:59.020
Yes. There's a sniper.

32:59.064 --> 33:00.804
Did you see them
on your cameras? Who is it?

33:00.848 --> 33:02.589
This is from
one of the new cameras

33:02.632 --> 33:04.025
on your balcony.

33:10.292 --> 33:11.685
Oh, my God.

33:13.339 --> 33:15.602
It was my daughters?

33:20.650 --> 33:22.348
I want you to know
I am not angry.

33:22.391 --> 33:25.786
I just need to know
what happened, okay?

33:25.829 --> 33:28.397
We wanted you and
J.R. to break up.

33:28.441 --> 33:31.618
So you pointed a laser
at her head?

33:31.661 --> 33:33.794
We were trying
to scare her away.

33:35.839 --> 33:38.059
What about the scary person
you saw in your room?

33:38.103 --> 33:39.234
That was us.

33:39.278 --> 33:40.844
Anything else?

33:40.888 --> 33:43.934
We sent fake e-mails
from you to Milos.

33:43.978 --> 33:45.588
Why would you do all this?

33:45.632 --> 33:47.155
To save you from her.

33:47.199 --> 33:49.549
Who? J.R.?

33:49.592 --> 33:51.116
She's a bad guy, Mommy.

33:51.159 --> 33:52.813
We do gun
drills in school

33:52.856 --> 33:54.815
in case bad guys come in.

33:54.858 --> 33:56.817
And we saw her with a gun.

33:56.860 --> 33:58.775
And that guy all bloody.

34:03.389 --> 34:05.739
You weren't asleep?
You saw that?

34:05.782 --> 34:09.351
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Looks like we all
read the situation wrong.

34:11.397 --> 34:12.963
Oh, girls.

34:13.007 --> 34:14.226
JANE:
I'm so sorry.

34:14.269 --> 34:15.618
You're right.

34:15.662 --> 34:17.142
I really messed up.

34:17.185 --> 34:18.621
And I hate the idea

34:18.665 --> 34:20.232
that my terrible judgment

34:20.275 --> 34:22.234
screwed things up
for you professionally.

34:22.277 --> 34:24.279
And I love you.

34:25.889 --> 34:27.239
And if you'll give me a chance,

34:27.282 --> 34:28.544
I promise
I'll make it up to you.

34:28.588 --> 34:30.024
Starting with this.

34:32.374 --> 34:35.290
It's my Ro-morse basket.

34:46.388 --> 34:48.129
Thank you.

34:48.173 --> 34:49.652
I really
appreciate this.

34:49.696 --> 34:51.480
Consider yourself forgiven.

34:51.524 --> 34:53.569
You can make me work
a bit harder, I deserve it.

34:53.613 --> 34:55.310
Well, you feel
bad enough.

34:55.354 --> 34:58.139
Plus, you made a
perfect Ro-morse basket

34:58.183 --> 34:59.793
without the help of
a props department.

34:59.836 --> 35:01.273
I know how
hard that is.

35:01.316 --> 35:03.971
Well, can we please
get back to work

35:04.014 --> 35:05.538
on the proposal?
I have some ideas.

35:05.581 --> 35:07.540
I would love that.Great.

35:07.583 --> 35:09.411
First of all, I really think
the story should be

35:09.455 --> 35:12.110
just as romantic for the old
people as it is for the young.

35:12.153 --> 35:13.850
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Speaking
of romantic old people...

35:17.811 --> 35:19.421
Actually, I'm sorry.

35:19.465 --> 35:21.771
But can we just stop referring
to them as old people?

35:21.815 --> 35:24.644
How about "slightly
less young people"?

35:24.687 --> 35:26.385
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Note taken.

35:26.428 --> 35:28.430
Now back to our
slightly less young people.

35:56.502 --> 35:58.286
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Twice.

36:14.563 --> 36:16.130
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Looks like Alba was reading

36:16.174 --> 36:17.392
Jorge right all along.

36:25.095 --> 36:26.706
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Aw...

36:26.749 --> 36:30.100
those slightly less young
people really are romantic.

36:31.189 --> 36:32.538
I like it.

36:32.581 --> 36:34.409
Hi-yah!
Oh. Whatcha doing?

36:34.453 --> 36:36.194
Practicing for
my belt test.

36:36.237 --> 36:38.021
I'm the best.
Where's Daddy?

36:38.065 --> 36:39.806
Oh, he'll be here soon,
Mr. Sweetface.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.244
Actually, I should text Raf.

36:43.288 --> 36:45.377
Make sure he picks up Mateo here
instead of Abuela's.

36:45.420 --> 36:47.988
Do you think
that's a good idea?

36:48.031 --> 36:49.642
It's a legit
parenting issue.

36:49.685 --> 36:51.165
I promise.

36:51.209 --> 36:53.341
I'm not just looking for
a reason to text him.

36:53.385 --> 36:54.647
Okay, but this
time allow me

36:54.690 --> 36:56.344
to assist you with your
writing assignment.

36:56.388 --> 36:58.955
The text must
be informative

36:58.999 --> 37:00.522
and not overbearing.

37:00.566 --> 37:03.177
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which I think we can all agree

37:03.221 --> 37:05.135
is another word for "creepy."

37:13.405 --> 37:14.884
Another emoji.

37:14.928 --> 37:16.625
Even after what happened.

37:16.669 --> 37:19.802
Okay, I rarely say this,
but less is more.

37:23.502 --> 37:25.460
Are you okay?

37:25.504 --> 37:28.507
I just keep thinking if I'd
done things differently...

37:28.550 --> 37:30.291
Well, you can't
change the past.

37:30.335 --> 37:32.641
You can only move
forward into the future.

37:32.685 --> 37:35.514
And who knows what
that will look like.

37:35.557 --> 37:37.167
That's it.
The future.

37:37.211 --> 37:39.169
I know, it's full
of possibility.
And it's how

37:39.213 --> 37:41.563
we make the slightly less
young people more intriguing.

37:41.607 --> 37:43.739
What if our
young leads' story

37:43.783 --> 37:45.567
is in present day
and you and River

37:45.611 --> 37:48.396
are living in the future?I like it, but is
it big enough?

37:48.440 --> 37:50.311
Let me finish.
In the future,

37:50.355 --> 37:52.182
in outer space.

37:52.226 --> 37:53.793
On Mars!

37:53.836 --> 37:55.664
It's brilliant.

37:55.708 --> 37:57.492
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And also
just a little confusing.

37:57.536 --> 37:59.581
Perfect.We can call it...

37:59.625 --> 38:03.019
This Is Mars.

38:03.063 --> 38:05.370
I have to call Justin
Hartley immediately.

38:05.413 --> 38:07.415
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Also feeling triumphant?

38:07.459 --> 38:09.896
I've never seen
a man so smitten.

38:09.939 --> 38:14.248
Jorge barely took his eyes
off you all afternoon.

38:25.868 --> 38:28.044
Oh, did you
tuck Mateo in?

38:28.088 --> 38:30.612
He rhymed two more words.

38:30.656 --> 38:33.833
They both rhyme with "tush"
but still progress, right?

38:36.444 --> 38:38.490
Ugh, it's just...

38:38.533 --> 38:40.666
of all the things Mateo
could struggle with.

38:40.709 --> 38:43.495
Hmm.The fact that
it's reading

38:43.538 --> 38:45.453
is really hard for me.

38:45.497 --> 38:47.455
I'm a writer, you know?

38:47.499 --> 38:49.109
I wanted him to love it.

39:09.085 --> 39:11.087
Oh, Ma...

39:29.671 --> 39:31.673
Oh, sorry.

39:31.717 --> 39:34.633
You are just making me
so emotional.

39:34.676 --> 39:37.462
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Speaking
of emotional mothers...

39:37.505 --> 39:39.551
They saw everything.

39:39.594 --> 39:42.423
I can't believe it. Of course
the girls are terrified of me.

39:42.467 --> 39:45.600
And you had that
poor parrot arrested.

39:45.644 --> 39:47.210
The bird's
been set free.

39:47.254 --> 39:49.169
Turns out she was
learning Czech so she could

39:49.212 --> 39:51.606
connect with the girls better
when they were at the Kids Club.

39:55.610 --> 39:57.569
What is it?

39:57.612 --> 39:58.570
What's wrong?

39:58.613 --> 40:01.311
I love you, J.R.

40:02.704 --> 40:04.619
But my children are my priority.

40:04.663 --> 40:06.621
Of course.
And right now,

40:06.665 --> 40:08.231
they're traumatized.

40:08.275 --> 40:10.016
And they're scared
to be around you.

40:11.060 --> 40:13.454
Which is why
I need to end things.

40:13.498 --> 40:15.325
I know this isn't fair.

40:15.369 --> 40:19.112
None of this is your fault.No, it is my
fault, actually.

40:19.155 --> 40:22.071
Since we got back
together, I haven't been

40:22.115 --> 40:24.639
putting in any
effort with the twins.

40:24.683 --> 40:26.598
I mean, the parrot
has been trying harder

40:26.641 --> 40:28.034
to bond with them.

40:28.077 --> 40:29.731
Let me try, at least.

40:29.775 --> 40:32.038
It might not work.I know.

40:32.081 --> 40:33.996
But you fought for us.

40:34.040 --> 40:36.042
Time and time again.

40:36.085 --> 40:37.696
Now it's my turn;
let me show

40:37.739 --> 40:39.741
the girls I am
not a bad guy.

40:39.785 --> 40:42.527
I want that more than anything.

40:42.570 --> 40:44.703
But I have to be
a mother first.

40:44.746 --> 40:46.052
Agreed.

40:46.095 --> 40:47.488
And if it seems like

40:47.532 --> 40:49.447
I am hurting the
girls in any way,

40:49.490 --> 40:51.579
I'll walk away.

40:53.320 --> 40:55.496
PETRA: So, J.R. and I
are working it out.

40:55.540 --> 40:58.151
But we need to consider
therapy for the girls.

40:58.194 --> 41:00.632
To really... address the trauma.

41:00.675 --> 41:02.329
Of course.
I agree.

41:02.372 --> 41:03.591
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Geez.

41:03.635 --> 41:05.724
How many stalkers
does this lady have?

41:07.856 --> 41:09.815
Thank you for being
so supportive.

41:11.860 --> 41:14.123
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, no. It's his stalker.

41:14.167 --> 41:16.648
Please don't be Jane.
Anybody but Jane.

41:19.781 --> 41:22.044
Hey, my favorite person in
the world. Are you almost home?

41:22.088 --> 41:24.438
Ugh, no,
still at the laundromat.

41:24.482 --> 41:26.658
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
He definitely has some
dirty laundry.

41:26.701 --> 41:28.790
BOBBY: Just folding
that tank top you got me.

41:28.834 --> 41:30.009
Love it, girl.

41:30.052 --> 41:31.401
Hey.

41:31.445 --> 41:33.186
Have you thought any more
about asking Rafael?

41:33.229 --> 41:35.536
If I can meet the kids?
I don't know.

41:35.580 --> 41:37.799
I want to, but we have
such a rocky history.

41:37.843 --> 41:39.584
Girl, don't doubt yourself.

41:39.627 --> 41:42.456
You are sober as a judge.
We go to yoga every day.

41:42.500 --> 41:44.980
You are ready
to be a loving aunt

41:45.024 --> 41:46.242
to your nieces and nephew.

41:46.286 --> 41:48.723
You're right.
I'm gonna call him.

41:48.767 --> 41:50.203
Good.

41:50.246 --> 41:52.205
Oh, shoot. Got to go;
laundry's done.
