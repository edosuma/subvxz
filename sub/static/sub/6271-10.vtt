14:17.056 --> 14:19.924
Where are you?

14:19.926 --> 14:22.160
Okay, I'll be right there.

14:32.238 --> 14:33.605
When did you get that?

14:37.243 --> 14:40.278
- Hey, I'm here
looking for whitney solloway.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.013
- She's 17.
- Hey, hey, hey--

14:42.015 --> 14:43.414
We're friends, okay?
- Fuck you!

14:43.416 --> 14:45.350
She's fucking 17!
[overlapping shouting]

14:45.352 --> 14:47.518
- Hey!
- I'm gonna fucking kill you.

14:47.520 --> 14:50.421
- [turns off tv]

14:50.423 --> 14:53.358
My mother hired
a private investigator.

14:53.360 --> 14:57.629
- What?
Why?

14:57.631 --> 15:00.965
- To build a case against you
in divorce proceedings.

15:00.967 --> 15:02.000
- I thought
we were taking a break.

15:02.002 --> 15:03.501
- He's really very good.

15:03.503 --> 15:05.270
He has all the names
of all the girls you took home,

15:05.272 --> 15:07.405
And he's got files on them
in his dossier.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.540
He actually says that,
used that word "dossier."

15:09.542 --> 15:11.910
- Oh, jesus christ, helen.

15:15.281 --> 15:16.648
- And the rubber room--

15:16.650 --> 15:20.051
When were you gonna tell me
about that?

15:20.053 --> 15:21.653
- Never.
- Why not?

15:21.655 --> 15:23.254
- 'cause it's none
of your fucking business.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.589
I'm still getting
my full fucking salary.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.391
- You think
that's what I care about?

15:26.393 --> 15:27.659
- How could you let your mother
hire a private investigator?

15:27.661 --> 15:29.427
- I don't let my mother
do anything.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.930
My mother does whatever
the fuck she wants to do,

15:31.932 --> 15:33.531
And she does not ask
my permission.

15:33.533 --> 15:34.933
- So is that why you called me
up here,

15:34.935 --> 15:37.135
To see how
you're gonna divorce me?

15:37.137 --> 15:38.403
- What is wrong with you?
- What's wrong with me?

15:38.405 --> 15:39.704
- Yeah, what's wrong
with you?

15:39.706 --> 15:41.339
Scotty lockhart
was fucking our daughter,

15:41.341 --> 15:43.007
And you don't tell me?
- When was I supposed to

15:43.009 --> 15:44.542
Fucking tell you?
You threw me out of the house.

15:44.544 --> 15:46.144
- Bullshit! Fuck you!
You are protecting yourself...

15:46.146 --> 15:47.145
- Now you're gathering evidence
against me,

15:47.147 --> 15:48.613
So you can take my children!

15:48.615 --> 15:50.148
- More than you're protecting
our daughter!

15:50.150 --> 15:51.282
- You think, for one moment,
that some judge

15:51.284 --> 15:52.483
Is gonna look
at that tape

15:52.485 --> 15:54.152
Of a father
defending his daughter

15:54.154 --> 15:55.486
And see some violent man
who doesn't deserve

15:55.488 --> 15:57.322
Custody of his children?
- I hate you so much!

15:57.324 --> 15:58.556
- If you want to divorce me,
that's one thing,

15:58.558 --> 16:00.158
But that shit is fucking
beneath you.

16:00.160 --> 16:04.495
- I don't want to divorce you,
you asshole!

16:04.497 --> 16:09.300
- You don't?
- No.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.369
- Well, what do you want?

16:15.741 --> 16:18.376
- I want you
to come home.

16:21.447 --> 16:24.716
I miss you.

16:24.718 --> 16:26.985
I can't do this alone.

16:26.987 --> 16:30.388
I hate my life
without you.

16:32.591 --> 16:36.361
You know--you know--
you know, you used to like me

16:36.363 --> 16:38.463
Because of how I am.

16:38.465 --> 16:42.333
I mean, I thought you chose me
for the way I am.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.402
You did.

16:46.071 --> 16:48.606
You did.
You wanted a certain life.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.675
And I gave that to you.

16:50.677 --> 16:53.244
You were tired
of being poor.

16:53.246 --> 16:55.780
You wanted a big family.
I could've stopped that too.

16:55.782 --> 16:58.016
I didn't need to have four kids
to try to make up

16:58.018 --> 17:00.685
For the wasteland
that was my childhood.

17:11.163 --> 17:15.400
You know, you never gave me
a chance.

17:15.402 --> 17:19.170
You never said,
"I'm different now."

17:20.572 --> 17:22.774
"I want something else."

17:22.776 --> 17:25.510
You just took it
all away.

17:25.512 --> 17:28.146
But I can change.
I can change.

17:28.148 --> 17:29.680
And I have been working
with dr. Gunderson

17:29.682 --> 17:31.249
Two times a week,
and I have new tools now.

17:31.251 --> 17:33.384
- Helen, helen, stop, stop.
Just stop, stop.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.520
It's okay.
It's okay.

17:35.522 --> 17:38.656
- [cries]

17:38.658 --> 17:41.426
- All gonna be okay.

17:41.428 --> 17:45.263
It's gonna be okay.

17:45.265 --> 17:48.733
It's okay.
It's okay.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.714
Did you just wipe your snot
all over my shirt?

18:03.716 --> 18:06.684
- [chuckles]

18:06.686 --> 18:08.086
Do you think
that's hot?

18:08.088 --> 18:09.287
- [chuckles]

18:59.771 --> 19:01.606
What time are you talking
to jeffries?

19:01.608 --> 19:05.910
- Now, man.
- What does he want from you?

19:05.912 --> 19:08.479
- I have no idea.
- He's gonna ask about me.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.748
Specifically about my car.
- Why?

19:10.750 --> 19:13.217
- It doesn't matter.
I need you to say nothing.

19:13.219 --> 19:15.453
You never met me.
You never fixed my car.

19:22.761 --> 19:25.830
- What's that worth?

19:25.832 --> 19:29.300
- How about 10 grand?
Will that do it?

19:29.302 --> 19:33.171
- No, but 20 will.

19:33.173 --> 19:35.273
- Okay, fine.

19:35.275 --> 19:36.574
I'll get you the cash
tomorrow.

19:36.576 --> 19:38.376
- Oh, come on, man.
Give me a break.

19:38.378 --> 19:41.846
You know, you got to give me
the cash today.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.781
- Okay, fine.

19:43.783 --> 19:46.450
I'll wire it to you
right now.

19:46.452 --> 19:47.852
- Damn, man.

19:47.854 --> 19:51.522
You must be
in some deep shit.

19:51.524 --> 19:54.592
- It's all gonna be fine.

19:56.662 --> 19:58.529
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:58.531 --> 20:03.201
- Hi.
- Dad, what are you doing here?

20:03.203 --> 20:06.537
- Your dad found out
that your boyfriend last summer

20:06.539 --> 20:08.839
Was not jack.

20:08.841 --> 20:10.274
- How?

20:10.276 --> 20:13.411
- Whitney, why did
you lie to me?

20:13.413 --> 20:14.679
- [sighs]

20:14.681 --> 20:16.314
Well, because I thought
you'd be upset.

20:16.316 --> 20:17.715
- I am.
I'm very upset, and I--

20:17.717 --> 20:20.284
We're gonna press charges.
- For what?

20:20.286 --> 20:22.687
- For statutory rape.
- Well, that's ridiculous.

20:22.689 --> 20:24.455
I'm 17.

20:24.457 --> 20:27.225
- You were 16 when it happened,
and he's 30 at least.

20:27.227 --> 20:30.494
He's probably older than that.
- Are you serious about this?

20:30.496 --> 20:32.863
- I'm very serious.
- Was this your idea?

20:32.865 --> 20:34.565
- Whitney, what this guy did
was a crime.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.367
- No, it wasn't.
It was consensual.

20:36.369 --> 20:38.236
- He took advantage of you.
- I'm telling you.

20:38.238 --> 20:41.839
I asked him to.
- He's 15 years older than you.

20:41.841 --> 20:43.507
- How old is alison?

20:46.245 --> 20:47.845
Really?

20:47.847 --> 20:49.714
What, you thought she wasn't
gonna tell me, dad?

20:49.716 --> 20:51.916
What was she supposed to say?
You grew apart?

20:51.918 --> 20:55.453
Jesus, I can't believe you
or you.

20:55.455 --> 20:56.654
You said it was over.

20:56.656 --> 20:58.022
You said you would never
forgive him.

20:58.024 --> 20:59.624
- Well, it's not that simple.

20:59.626 --> 21:00.925
- You said
he was a bad person

21:00.927 --> 21:02.994
Who had deliberately ruined
our lives.

21:02.996 --> 21:05.263
You said he might be
a sociopath.

21:05.265 --> 21:07.498
- I was angry.
- Well, I had to live with that.

21:07.500 --> 21:08.866
I had to go see dad
all the time

21:08.868 --> 21:10.468
And act like
everything was normal,

21:10.470 --> 21:12.937
All the time wondering,
"is he a sociopath?"

21:12.939 --> 21:14.038
- Come on.
Now, look.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.406
I never should
have said that.

21:15.408 --> 21:16.941
I'm sorry.
I apologize.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.943
- You--you're a hypocrite.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.778
You think you can just
walk back in here

21:20.780 --> 21:22.546
After four months
of not being here

21:22.548 --> 21:23.614
And be my parent?

21:23.616 --> 21:25.516
- I am your parent.

21:25.518 --> 21:28.019
Now, you may not like that
or me, but I'm still your dad.

21:28.021 --> 21:29.687
And by the way, we're not
asking permission here.

21:29.689 --> 21:31.022
We're telling you
what's about to happen.

21:31.024 --> 21:32.490
Is that clear?
- You can't do that.

21:32.492 --> 21:34.558
I love him.
- I don't care, whit.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.627
- You are a sociopath!
- Thank you.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.863
Thanks a lot for that.

21:40.299 --> 21:41.732
[door squeaks]

21:45.070 --> 21:48.306
She okay?
- Not really.

21:55.781 --> 21:58.049
- Told you
this was a bad idea.

21:58.051 --> 21:59.517
- Which part?

22:04.389 --> 22:07.658
- You know,
maybe we should--

22:07.660 --> 22:09.493
Maybe we should
just let it go.

22:11.930 --> 22:15.800
I mean, she obviously knew
what she was doing.

22:15.802 --> 22:18.336
She was almost 17.

22:22.708 --> 22:26.644
- I'm gonna press charges.
You can join me or not.

22:28.680 --> 22:31.682
[rummaging in the background]

22:49.501 --> 22:51.836
- Did you just change
in the bathroom?

22:51.838 --> 22:55.005
- Yeah.
- Why?

22:55.007 --> 22:57.575
- I don't know, noah.

23:04.783 --> 23:07.618
- Should I leave?

23:07.620 --> 23:09.520
- No.

23:09.522 --> 23:12.056
Please don't.

23:52.831 --> 23:55.833
[ringtone playing]

24:15.053 --> 24:16.987
[phone dings, vibrates]

24:23.862 --> 24:25.796
- Okay, everybody,
we'll be back by tonight,

24:25.798 --> 24:27.565
And you be good
for grandma, okay?

24:27.567 --> 24:29.733
- Where are you going?
- Going on a little trip.

24:29.735 --> 24:32.236
- Where's whitney?
- She's at her friend's house.

24:32.238 --> 24:33.938
- Is dad living
with us again?

24:33.940 --> 24:35.739
- I don't want
to talk about that right now.

24:35.741 --> 24:38.108
- I have an idea: Why don't you
and I go pick up whitney?

24:38.110 --> 24:39.944
Noah can spend the day
with his children,

24:39.946 --> 24:41.245
Who clearly miss him.

24:41.247 --> 24:43.080
- Mom, you said
you would watch them.

24:43.082 --> 24:45.983
- And I'd be happy to,
but considering the predicament

24:45.985 --> 24:47.885
Our whitney finds herself in,

24:47.887 --> 24:49.153
I just wonder if her father is
the appropriate role model.

24:49.155 --> 24:50.821
- Are you kidding me, margaret?
- Don't.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.890
- You think this situation
is somehow my fault.

24:52.892 --> 24:54.258
- Please don't.
Please.

24:54.260 --> 24:55.726
- No, you and bruce
have the worst values

24:55.728 --> 24:57.995
In the western world.

24:57.997 --> 24:59.563
You've been filling
whitney's head

24:59.565 --> 25:01.031
With your toxic,
narcissistic bullshit

25:01.033 --> 25:02.166
Since she was a child,

25:02.168 --> 25:03.968
And you stand there
judging me?

25:03.970 --> 25:06.237
- I'm sorry, noah.
What would you like me to do?

25:06.239 --> 25:08.172
Congratulate you
on finally revealing yourself

25:08.174 --> 25:10.774
To be the useless asshole
I always suspected you were?

25:10.776 --> 25:13.043
- Stop yelling at dad!
- Yeah, stop it!

25:13.045 --> 25:17.815
- Guys, just go.
We'll be fine.

25:27.125 --> 25:28.993
- Thank you, honey.

25:31.129 --> 25:33.731
- Bye.

25:43.542 --> 25:48.212
- You know
what I just figured out?

25:48.214 --> 25:50.748
- What?

25:54.686 --> 25:56.820
- I was so afraid
of marrying my father,

25:56.822 --> 26:00.024
I never realized

26:00.026 --> 26:03.160
I was marrying
my mother.

26:03.162 --> 26:04.562
[snickers]

26:10.702 --> 26:12.236
[sighs]

26:23.214 --> 26:26.050
Perfect.

26:38.330 --> 26:40.598
Where is she?

26:40.600 --> 26:43.601
- Inside
with my mother-in-law.

26:43.603 --> 26:46.203
- Is scotty in there?
- No.

26:46.205 --> 26:50.608
He's--he's gone.
- Gone where?

26:50.610 --> 26:53.143
- I don't know.

27:01.987 --> 27:05.189
[dishes clinking]

27:07.225 --> 27:10.961
- Mr. Solloway, hello.
Mrs. Solloway, hi.

27:10.963 --> 27:13.097
I'm cherry lockhart.
- You fucking traitor.

27:13.099 --> 27:14.365
I thought
we were friends.

27:14.367 --> 27:15.966
- Can we just sit down?

27:15.968 --> 27:18.369
And we'll just talk
this through, okay?

27:18.371 --> 27:20.004
- No, I'm sorry.

27:20.006 --> 27:22.039
I'm taking my daughter,
and I'm going home.

27:22.041 --> 27:23.907
- I know you want to,
but can we just speak?

27:23.909 --> 27:26.377
I just want to say
that I did not realize

27:26.379 --> 27:27.878
What was going on
this past summer

27:27.880 --> 27:29.713
Between my son and--

27:29.715 --> 27:31.015
I mean, if I'd known,

27:31.017 --> 27:33.317
I obviously would have
put a stop to it.

27:33.319 --> 27:35.719
He's much too old for her.
- Yes, I agree.

27:35.721 --> 27:37.121
Whitney, come on.
- Can I just ask?

27:37.123 --> 27:39.890
Have you called the police?

27:39.892 --> 27:43.394
- No, not yet.
- Oh, thank god.

27:43.396 --> 27:46.063
Please don't.
Please?

27:46.065 --> 27:47.331
I know my son.

27:47.333 --> 27:49.033

- That would make you
a fucking idiot.

40:53.852 --> 40:57.587
- I just want you
to have something that you love.

41:00.691 --> 41:03.660
- I love you.

41:03.662 --> 41:06.529
- I don't know how to fix
what's broken between us, cole.

41:06.531 --> 41:08.531
I-I don't think
it's fixable.

41:08.533 --> 41:10.033
- Okay, what if we go see
another therapist?

41:14.672 --> 41:16.072
- It's not gonna
bring him back.

41:16.074 --> 41:18.074
- I know that.

41:18.076 --> 41:20.710
- And that is the only thing
that can fix this for me.

41:20.712 --> 41:21.811
- No.
- I look at you.

41:21.813 --> 41:25.114
And I see his face.

41:25.116 --> 41:28.084
- People survive this.
They do.

41:28.086 --> 41:29.953
You know that.
It's incredibly hard,

41:29.955 --> 41:31.488
But they survive together.

41:31.490 --> 41:34.090
They heal together.
- I don't want to.

41:34.092 --> 41:37.093
It's too hard.
I don't want to do it.

41:41.632 --> 41:43.233
- Is this about him?

41:43.235 --> 41:46.970
Are you with him now?
- No.

41:46.972 --> 41:48.972
I haven't talked to him
since I last talked to you.

41:48.974 --> 41:52.175
It's not about him.
It's about me.

41:53.978 --> 41:57.847
I'm sorry.

41:57.849 --> 42:01.784
I am so, so sorry
gabriel died.

42:01.786 --> 42:05.188
I don't know what we did
to deserve that.

42:05.190 --> 42:09.859
We loved him.
We took good care of him.

42:09.861 --> 42:13.663
But he's gone,

42:13.665 --> 42:17.267
And I see him all over your face
and your body.

42:21.205 --> 42:23.139
You've changed for me.

42:28.012 --> 42:29.279
- What are you saying,
alison,

42:29.281 --> 42:31.781
That you want to forget
about him?

42:31.783 --> 42:34.651
- No.

42:34.653 --> 42:36.686
Forget about you.

42:53.203 --> 42:55.271
Why weren't
you watching him?

42:59.310 --> 43:02.111
- Excuse me?

43:02.113 --> 43:05.315
- I went to get a blanket.

43:05.317 --> 43:08.117
I left you alone
for three minutes.

43:08.119 --> 43:09.919
How could you have let him
go under?

43:09.921 --> 43:13.189
- Why wouldn't you just take him
to the fucking hospital?

43:13.191 --> 43:14.657
I'm gonna go surfing,

43:14.659 --> 43:16.259
And when I come back
to this house,

43:16.261 --> 43:19.596
I want you out of here, and
I never want to see you again.

43:21.799 --> 43:23.933
- Oh, good.
Thank god you're still here.

43:23.935 --> 43:25.735
You have to come with me.
- What?

43:25.737 --> 43:28.004
- That solloway girl
is here.

43:28.006 --> 43:29.839
Cherry's been trying
to call you.

43:29.841 --> 43:31.341
She's at the ranch,
and she's looking for scotty.

43:31.343 --> 43:32.709

43:32.711 --> 43:34.077
- Just will you come
with me, please?

43:34.079 --> 43:35.345
Quickly.
I'll explain in the car.

43:35.347 --> 43:38.147
You too.

43:52.963 --> 43:54.163
- Hi.

43:54.165 --> 43:56.633
Sorry to drag you both
into this.

43:56.635 --> 43:58.368
- Tell them
what you just told me.

43:58.370 --> 44:00.103
- Scotty and I were together
for a while,

44:00.105 --> 44:01.771
And my parents
just found out,

44:01.773 --> 44:03.840
And now they want to charge him
with statutory rape.

44:03.842 --> 44:04.841
- What?
- Yeah, look.

44:04.843 --> 44:06.776
It's not about him.

44:06.778 --> 44:08.845
They're going through something,
as I'm sure you'd know.

44:08.847 --> 44:10.179
- Hold on a second.
You and scotty?

44:10.181 --> 44:12.015
- Yes.
- Where is he?

44:12.017 --> 44:14.717
- Look, this isn't his fault.
You shouldn't blame him.

44:14.719 --> 44:18.054
- How old are you?
- What difference does it make?

44:18.056 --> 44:19.722
- How old are you?

44:19.724 --> 44:24.127
- I'm 17.
- Oh, jesus christ.

44:25.729 --> 44:30.033
- What do we do?

44:30.035 --> 44:33.302
- I don't know.

44:33.304 --> 44:36.272
- Maybe if I just speak
to your mother as a mother,

44:36.274 --> 44:38.074
I appeal
to her sympathy--

44:38.076 --> 44:40.777
She has sons of her own.
- No, that'll never work.

44:40.779 --> 44:42.679
- My mom pays lawyers
to do her talking.

44:42.681 --> 44:45.748
- Does she know where you are
right now?

44:45.750 --> 44:47.016
- No, I don't think so.

44:47.018 --> 44:49.085
- Well, maybe
you could call her.

44:49.087 --> 44:50.887
Get her to pick you up,

44:50.889 --> 44:52.221
And then cherry could have
the conversation in person.

44:52.223 --> 44:56.893
- Why don't you call him?
- Why?

44:56.895 --> 44:59.295
- We don't know
that your mother's behind this.

44:59.297 --> 45:02.965
If I was your father,
I would want to kill scotty.

45:02.967 --> 45:05.435
We need to talk to him
together,

45:05.437 --> 45:07.203
And if you call him,
he'll come.

45:07.205 --> 45:08.905
- And what if he comes alone?
- Oh, please.

45:08.907 --> 45:10.239
She'll never
let that happen.

45:10.241 --> 45:14.310
She's already made
that mistake once.

45:14.312 --> 45:15.978
- I-I don't want
to do this.

45:15.980 --> 45:18.915
- I don't give a shit
what you want, alison.

45:18.917 --> 45:20.850
Make the call.

45:25.789 --> 45:29.058
- Fine.

45:40.204 --> 45:42.739
- I need you
to say nothing.

45:42.741 --> 45:44.474
You never met me.
You never fixed my car.

45:44.476 --> 45:47.210
- What's that worth?

45:47.212 --> 45:50.947
- How about 10 grand?
Will that do it?

45:50.949 --> 45:54.817
- No, but 20 will.

45:54.819 --> 45:57.487
- Okay, fine.

45:57.489 --> 45:59.222
- Nice work, jake.

45:59.224 --> 46:02.091
All right, let's finish
the affidavit and get it in.

46:02.093 --> 46:03.826
- So do I get to keep
the money?

46:03.828 --> 46:06.429

to us in cash.

46:06.431 --> 46:08.030

46:08.032 --> 46:10.266
But you didn't call the irs,
right?

I got two kids at home

46:14.239 --> 46:15.505
And another one
on the way.

46:15.507 --> 46:17.240
I can't afford
to lose my business.

46:17.242 --> 46:19.275
- You better stop taking money
under the table, man.

46:19.277 --> 46:20.977
It's way too easy for me
to find that out.

46:20.979 --> 46:23.513

She doesn't want to come out.

- Hi.

48:20.097 --> 48:21.264
Where's cherry?

48:21.266 --> 48:23.132

She'll be here soon.
- All right, the party's over.

48:25.136 --> 48:26.969

to talk to you.

48:26.971 --> 48:28.504

in talking to her,

48:28.506 --> 48:29.505

- Stop.

48:42.520 --> 48:46.656

there's another side to you,

'cause she sure as shit

a lot to be upset about.

48:54.666 --> 48:56.532

Then we should do that,
but right now,

48:59.570 --> 49:01.270

with me anymore.
