01:06.533 --> 01:08.372
The story so far,

01:08.373 --> 01:11.332
'Miss Sharp made a friend
of everyone in her

01:11.333 --> 01:13.332
'new family, well almost everyone.'

01:13.333 --> 01:15.372
Be sure I have my eye always on you.

01:15.373 --> 01:17.332
'With the help of a dear friend,

01:17.333 --> 01:19.332
'Miss Sedley won back her
sweetheart.'

01:19.333 --> 01:20.333
George!

01:20.333 --> 01:21.333
'For now.'

01:21.334 --> 01:24.332
I don't like the look
of Sedley's affairs.

01:24.333 --> 01:25.333
I'm sorry!

01:25.334 --> 01:26.692
'Back in darkest Hampshire, menfolk

01:26.693 --> 01:29.332
'young and old fought for the chance
to partner Miss Sharp,

01:29.333 --> 01:32.332
'who preferred an offer
from the lady with the money.'

01:32.333 --> 01:34.332
Beware old London town,

01:34.333 --> 01:37.332
Miss Sharp is on her way.

01:37.333 --> 01:40.332
Tonight, Becky's fortunes go up,
and then down.

01:40.333 --> 01:42.332
Is she downhearted?

01:42.333 --> 01:44.332
No! This is Vanity Fair,

01:44.333 --> 01:46.852
a world where everyone is striving

01:46.853 --> 01:48.559
for what is not worth having.

02:41.181 --> 02:44.181
Oh, I so love to see her
in pretty clothes!

02:45.181 --> 02:47.221
She's worth every penny.

02:49.181 --> 02:51.860
She's an angel.

02:51.861 --> 02:56.180
The only one in the whole world
I can really trust.

02:56.181 --> 02:59.180
I wonder what on earth
we did without her in days gone by.

02:59.181 --> 03:01.180
Ow! Ow!

03:01.181 --> 03:03.180
Ow!

03:03.181 --> 03:08.181
For heaven's sake, Briggs,
everyday new snivel.

03:16.181 --> 03:17.593
We don't have much time.

03:42.181 --> 03:43.861
Napoleon's escaped!

03:48.021 --> 03:49.181
Who?

03:52.861 --> 03:55.380
Napoleon on the loose,
our old enemy gathering his forces!

03:55.381 --> 03:59.180
Duke of Wellington
recalled to command!

03:59.181 --> 04:00.181
Bless you, sir.

04:02.021 --> 04:04.181
Enemy forces...

04:08.701 --> 04:11.180
You haven't told her?

04:11.181 --> 04:12.181
Nothing to tell yet.

04:12.182 --> 04:15.180
Napoleon's escaped from Elba,
the Duke of Wellington's already

04:15.181 --> 04:18.946
in Belgium and there's nothing
for a soldier to tell his fiancee?

04:19.180 --> 04:23.180
You're not the one who has to deal
with her weeping and wailing.

04:23.181 --> 04:24.181
I'll put it off
as long as possible,

04:24.182 --> 04:26.830
I'll tell her
when we get our marching orders.

04:51.181 --> 04:53.181
I'm cold.

05:01.181 --> 05:03.181
I'm hot.

05:05.181 --> 05:07.180
I'm so scared.

05:07.181 --> 05:08.541
So scared.

05:10.181 --> 05:11.540
Don't leave me.

05:11.541 --> 05:15.181
I'm here. I'm here, I'm always here,
there's nothing to fear.

05:16.221 --> 05:19.020
Death, t'will come for me,

05:19.021 --> 05:21.180
and I shall face him alone,

05:21.181 --> 05:23.240
for I have done no good in my life.

05:24.181 --> 05:25.700
None.

05:25.701 --> 05:30.541
I will be one of those pathetic
women who die...

05:33.181 --> 05:34.541
...unmourned.

05:35.861 --> 05:37.181
Oh, Becky.

05:53.181 --> 05:55.380
Ow!
Misery guts!

05:55.381 --> 05:58.181
God damn your eyes!

06:03.181 --> 06:05.181
All gone wrong, it has, boy.

06:07.181 --> 06:08.181
All gone wrong.

06:11.181 --> 06:13.180
It's just here, that's the one.
Driver!

06:13.181 --> 06:16.180
Odd sort of place to live.

06:16.181 --> 06:19.180
It's a perfectly respectable
neighbourhood, Aunt.

06:19.181 --> 06:21.299
I know they'll be pleased to see us.

06:25.181 --> 06:26.181
Amelia!

06:26.182 --> 06:28.180
We were passing and I couldn't
resist

06:28.181 --> 06:29.220
and Matilda didn't object,
and so...

06:29.221 --> 06:32.180
The middling sort, are they?

06:32.181 --> 06:34.180
Stockbrokers, Aunt.

06:34.181 --> 06:36.220
But you hate that kind of snobbery.

06:36.221 --> 06:38.180
Oh, Becky!

06:38.181 --> 06:40.180
What a lovely surprise!

06:40.181 --> 06:42.181
Oh, Becky!

06:43.381 --> 06:46.180
Oh, George, look who's here!

06:46.181 --> 06:47.861
Miss Sharp.

06:56.541 --> 06:58.180
Won't you come in, Miss Crawley?

06:58.181 --> 07:00.860
Without a proper invitation?

07:00.861 --> 07:03.180
Well, perhaps it's the modern way.

07:03.181 --> 07:04.381
Quite.

07:40.181 --> 07:41.181
Tea, Madam?

07:41.182 --> 07:44.180
Wine, I think, Sam.

07:44.181 --> 07:46.180
Of course, wine, thank you.

07:46.181 --> 07:48.180
But Miss...

07:48.181 --> 07:49.181
In the garden?

07:49.182 --> 07:52.181
No, fresh air is
fatal to ladies of distinction.

07:53.701 --> 07:55.180
My dear Mrs Sedley,

07:55.181 --> 07:57.180
I do wonder at your judgement

07:57.181 --> 07:59.358
in letting him loose
on the porcelain.

08:10.181 --> 08:13.180
Sam, Sam, I'm so sorry.

08:13.181 --> 08:15.861
It's not me
you should be worrying about.

08:17.181 --> 08:19.180
How can they have wine, Miss?

08:19.181 --> 08:20.887
The master's sold the cellar.

08:21.221 --> 08:23.180
What?

08:23.181 --> 08:25.701
This is none of your concern,
Amelia.

08:26.861 --> 08:29.180
A gentleman is entitled
to sell his wine,

08:29.181 --> 08:32.179
it's an investment
just like any other.

08:32.181 --> 08:34.181
Did the sale raise enough, Mama?

08:36.181 --> 08:37.220
Enough to repay Mr Osborne?

08:37.221 --> 08:41.181
I'm not privy to the gentlemen's
business, now hush.

08:43.181 --> 08:45.180
I'm in a gentleman's family now,
Mr Osborne,

08:45.181 --> 08:47.180
good old English country stock,

08:47.181 --> 08:49.020
noble and serious,

08:49.021 --> 08:51.180
going back generations.

08:51.181 --> 08:54.180
So may I take it your new situation

08:54.181 --> 08:57.860
has not proved to be
the ordeal you feared, Miss Sharp?

08:57.861 --> 09:01.020
The wages are tolerable,
thank you for reminding me

09:01.021 --> 09:04.180
that I'm of the class of person
which needs to earn them.

09:04.181 --> 09:06.181
I only make a polite enquiry.

09:07.181 --> 09:10.180
Just think, Mr Osborne,

09:10.181 --> 09:12.180
had you not stood in Mr Joss's way

09:12.181 --> 09:14.180
you could have had a
Montmorency for a sister-in-law.

09:14.181 --> 09:16.180
Which, considering your own

09:16.181 --> 09:19.180
unimpressive pedigree, would have
been quite a coup.

09:19.181 --> 09:21.181
Who was your grandfather, exactly?

09:22.181 --> 09:23.700
He was a butcher.

09:23.701 --> 09:25.180
Voila.

09:25.181 --> 09:27.181
I'm not ashamed of my family.

09:28.181 --> 09:29.700
Nor I of mine, sire.

09:29.701 --> 09:30.861
Miss Sharp...

09:33.381 --> 09:38.180
...the carriage is ready,
and my aunt is tiring.

09:38.181 --> 09:40.181
Lord, she is that.

09:50.381 --> 09:52.180
He likes you.

09:52.181 --> 09:54.180
Hush, nonsense.

09:54.181 --> 09:56.700
He's rich, or he soon will be.

09:56.701 --> 09:59.180
He's so handsome.

09:59.181 --> 10:01.180
He is very handsome.

10:01.181 --> 10:02.860
Sharp by name,

10:02.861 --> 10:05.180
and sharp I fear by nature.

10:05.181 --> 10:06.220
Our Miss Sharp?

10:06.221 --> 10:10.180
Wild, proud, a desperate flirt,

10:10.181 --> 10:12.180
I only warn you as a friend,
Crawley.

10:12.181 --> 10:13.540
Well...

10:13.541 --> 10:15.181
Goodbye.

10:21.181 --> 10:25.381
...sage advice, thank you, my boy.

11:04.181 --> 11:06.180
Blast!

11:06.181 --> 11:07.181
Oh! Oh! Oh!

11:22.181 --> 11:24.180
She tripped over her dress.

11:24.181 --> 11:27.381
Horrocks, take the girls.

11:31.021 --> 11:32.700
Come along, girls.

11:32.701 --> 11:34.180
Is Mama dead?

11:34.181 --> 11:36.180
Let's get you upstairs.

11:36.181 --> 11:40.181
Mum's dead!

11:42.181 --> 11:45.180
Geddup!

11:45.181 --> 11:47.180
Geddup, I say, geddup!

11:47.181 --> 11:50.181
Geddup! Up! Get it up!

11:52.181 --> 11:53.181
Geddup!

12:07.796 --> 12:09.795
Oh, good morning Miss, er...

12:09.796 --> 12:12.795
Miss Sharp joins us
from Queen's Crawley.

12:12.796 --> 12:14.795
Oh, I was born on that estate, Miss!

12:14.796 --> 12:17.795
The son of a humble under-gardener,
married the cook,

12:17.796 --> 12:19.795
rose to be a butler. Now look at me.

12:19.796 --> 12:22.795
I can see you've done very
well for yourself, Mr Raggles.

12:22.796 --> 12:25.054
Not just a shopkeeper, not any more.

12:25.056 --> 12:28.242
Mrs Raggles and I plan
to buy a house to let.

12:28.244 --> 12:30.243
You shall be landlords!

12:30.244 --> 12:33.244
You climbed the very heights,
Mr Raggles.

12:35.244 --> 12:37.244
Some jam for your tea? Oh!

12:43.244 --> 12:45.480
Mr Raggles bought it
for you specially.

12:46.764 --> 12:50.244
Is there not a single little
sweetmeat in this house?

12:52.244 --> 12:53.604
Oh...

12:56.244 --> 13:01.764
The poor soul, how I long
to smooth her fevered brow.

13:08.244 --> 13:11.243
It's no pleasure to me
to sit up all night with her,

13:11.244 --> 13:13.715
and I wish she would
let you do it instead.

13:15.244 --> 13:17.244
Oh, my dear friend...

13:18.444 --> 13:20.244
...may I call you Arabella?

13:22.244 --> 13:23.283
Have another glass of wine.

13:23.284 --> 13:25.084
Oh, yes.

13:32.244 --> 13:34.283
You are still her companion,

13:34.284 --> 13:37.873
whereas I am but a poor little
girl without jot of harm in me.

13:40.244 --> 13:42.244
To friendship?

13:43.764 --> 13:45.244
To friendship.

13:47.244 --> 13:49.243
Yes, dear Becky,

13:49.244 --> 13:52.244
let no rivalry come between us.

13:53.244 --> 13:54.244
Becky!

13:56.084 --> 13:57.243
Becky!

13:57.244 --> 14:02.243
Have I not tended that
dear couch for 23 years?

14:02.244 --> 14:03.244
Oh!

14:03.245 --> 14:07.244
Have I not attended that
dear couch 23 years?

14:09.244 --> 14:11.244
Enter.

14:13.764 --> 14:15.243
What is it, Briggs?

14:15.244 --> 14:18.243
Your brother is here.

14:18.244 --> 14:21.244
With his hand out, no doubt?
Get rid of him, Becky.

14:22.244 --> 14:26.244
He is wearing black crepe. Oh!

14:35.924 --> 14:39.277
Miss Crawley offers her
condolences on your sad news, sir.

14:40.244 --> 14:43.244
Unfortunately,
she is not well enough to descend.

14:44.604 --> 14:46.444
It's not her I want, Miss.

14:49.244 --> 14:51.243
I want you Becky.

14:51.244 --> 14:54.244
Back at Queen's Crawley, directly.

14:55.244 --> 14:57.243
I hope to come soon, Sir,
once Miss Crawley's better.

14:57.244 --> 15:00.243
Her'll cast you off like an old shoe

15:00.244 --> 15:01.244
when she's worn you out,

15:01.245 --> 15:03.243
but me, Becky,

15:03.244 --> 15:06.244
I can't get on without you.

15:07.244 --> 15:09.283
The house all goes wrong.

15:09.284 --> 15:11.243
The girls run wild,

15:11.244 --> 15:13.283
all my accounts
have got muddled again.

15:13.284 --> 15:16.244
But Sir, I cannot leave your sister.

15:19.244 --> 15:21.243
Then come as Lady Crawley.

15:21.244 --> 15:23.244
Oh! Get out!

15:28.244 --> 15:31.244
Marry me, Becky.

15:32.924 --> 15:35.243
There, will that satisfy you?

15:35.244 --> 15:38.244
Come back with me and be my wife.

15:42.244 --> 15:43.763
Her ladyship not even buried,

15:43.764 --> 15:45.243
and Sir Pitt is on his knee,

15:45.244 --> 15:47.244
proposing to Miss Sharp!

15:49.084 --> 15:50.244
Get out my way!

15:52.244 --> 15:53.244
Shawl!

15:55.244 --> 15:58.243
You shall do what you like
and spend what you like,

15:58.244 --> 15:59.763
have it all your own way,

15:59.764 --> 16:02.470
I'll make you happy, you see if I
don't, Becky.

16:03.244 --> 16:05.083
Forgive me.

16:05.084 --> 16:07.243
You shall be the mistress
of Queen's Crawley.

16:07.244 --> 16:09.243
£4,000 a year.

16:09.244 --> 16:11.083
And when I'm gone,

16:11.084 --> 16:12.243
you can have the lot.

16:12.244 --> 16:14.244
I'll leave it all to you.

16:19.244 --> 16:20.924
Oh, I cannot marry you!

16:22.244 --> 16:24.603
If there's another suitor
with a better offer,

16:24.604 --> 16:26.840
I'd like to see
the whites of his eyes.

16:29.444 --> 16:30.764
There is no suitor.

16:32.244 --> 16:33.443
Then marry me, be my queen.

16:33.444 --> 16:37.244
Oh, sir, I'm married already.

16:38.244 --> 16:39.244
Uh?

16:41.244 --> 16:44.443
And who'd take you to be a wife
without a shilling to your fortune?

16:44.444 --> 16:46.244
Some street sweeper?

16:47.244 --> 16:49.243
Oh...

16:49.244 --> 16:51.763
If the proposal is respectable

16:51.764 --> 16:53.243
is not the gentleman

16:53.244 --> 16:55.243
supposed to kneel before the lady.

16:55.244 --> 16:56.774
Please God don't tell her.

16:58.444 --> 17:00.243
I have thanked Sir Pitt Crawley,
ma'am,

17:00.244 --> 17:03.284
but have told him
that I never can become his Lady.

17:05.243 --> 17:09.242
Pray, Miss Sharp, are you waiting
for the Prince Regent's divorce?

17:09.243 --> 17:12.242
If you think our family
is not good enough for you?

17:12.243 --> 17:14.762
You leave her alone, Matilda.

17:14.763 --> 17:18.242
Whether she marries me or not,
she's a good little girl.

17:18.243 --> 17:19.243
And I'm her friend.

17:19.244 --> 17:22.242
Don't be ridiculous, Pitt.

17:22.243 --> 17:26.242
Your room at Queen's Crawley is
waiting whenever you're ready.

17:26.243 --> 17:28.243
Off with you!

17:29.244 --> 17:30.244
Woof!

17:35.244 --> 17:36.244
Oh!

17:36.245 --> 17:39.083
Why on earth would
the child say no to him?

17:39.084 --> 17:41.243
And don't say old and ugly.

17:41.244 --> 17:43.243
Well, there must be some obstacle

17:43.244 --> 17:46.244
in the form of an existing
romantic attachment.

17:49.084 --> 17:50.261
Very astute, Briggs.

17:54.604 --> 17:58.243
Some apothecary perhaps?

17:58.244 --> 18:00.243
Or a house painter,

18:00.244 --> 18:03.243
or maybe a young curate
has touched your heart?

18:03.244 --> 18:07.243
He is young, certainly.

18:07.244 --> 18:09.244
More than that...

18:10.244 --> 18:12.244
...forgive me, I cannot say.

18:13.764 --> 18:16.603
My silly, lovestruck darling.

18:16.604 --> 18:19.243
I'll set the young
fellow up in a shop.

18:19.244 --> 18:21.243
You'll have to tell me
his name then,

18:21.244 --> 18:23.083
or I won't be able
to get him a sign.

18:23.084 --> 18:25.243
Oh, Miss Crawley, love me always,
promise you will love me always.

18:25.244 --> 18:27.283
Don't go sentimental on me,
Rebecca,

18:27.284 --> 18:29.244
it doesn't suit you.

19:32.244 --> 19:35.443
But for her sudden coldness,
I would have confessed all,

19:35.444 --> 19:37.763
right there and then.

19:37.764 --> 19:41.294
It was only when she'd said
she would set you up in a shop...

19:44.244 --> 19:46.244
You're not regretting it, are you?

19:47.244 --> 19:49.243
Lying here with you?

19:49.244 --> 19:51.243
Right now?

19:51.244 --> 19:53.243
How shall I regret marrying you?

19:53.244 --> 19:57.083
Because you could have married
the Lord of the Manor instead.

19:57.084 --> 19:59.320
I did regret that,
for one long moment.

20:01.244 --> 20:02.244
You booby, I'm joking.

20:02.244 --> 20:03.244
Hmm.

20:03.244 --> 20:04.244
I do keep wondering

20:04.245 --> 20:07.243
if we should have tried for
Matilda's blessing in advance.

20:07.244 --> 20:10.656
So much more romantic,
just running away though, wasn't it?

20:15.244 --> 20:18.243
If we tried, and she'd said no, you
might not have married me at all.

20:18.244 --> 20:20.284
Oh, yes I would.

20:22.244 --> 20:25.243
My Aunt adores us both.

20:25.244 --> 20:27.244
She will come round.

20:29.244 --> 20:30.924
I do have a plan.

20:33.924 --> 20:35.243
A letter,

20:35.244 --> 20:36.244
for Miss Briggs.
Oh!

20:36.245 --> 20:38.244
Miss Briggs never gets letters.

20:39.244 --> 20:41.243
It is from Miss Sharp!

20:41.244 --> 20:43.243
Miss Sharp?

20:43.244 --> 20:44.244
Yes, dear Becky.

20:44.245 --> 20:46.243
Is she not upstairs in her room?

20:46.244 --> 20:47.244
Oh!

20:47.245 --> 20:49.244
Well, come on!

20:52.764 --> 20:54.353
"Dear friend of my heart...

20:56.244 --> 20:59.243
"..break the news
as your delicate sympathy

20:59.244 --> 21:03.244
"will know how, to our dear,
our beloved benefactress.

21:04.924 --> 21:07.763
"Beg her to receive her children.

21:07.764 --> 21:10.243
Children? I don't understand
what you're talking about,

21:10.244 --> 21:11.244
can I see that?

21:11.245 --> 21:14.243
"For I am wedded

21:14.244 --> 21:18.244
"to the best
and most generous of men.

21:20.444 --> 21:22.764
"Miss Crawley's Rawdon...

21:24.244 --> 21:27.244
"..is my Rawdon.

21:32.244 --> 21:34.243
Married?

21:34.244 --> 21:36.243
To Rawdon?

21:36.244 --> 21:38.243
Monster!

21:38.244 --> 21:39.244
Wretch!

21:39.245 --> 21:42.243
Traitor! "Your affectionate and
grateful, Rebecca Crawley.

21:42.244 --> 21:44.443
Treasure hunter, revolutionary...

21:44.444 --> 21:47.243
"Tremble for the answer
which to seal her happiness."

21:47.244 --> 21:50.243
Tremble, vixen.

21:50.244 --> 21:51.764
Tremble in vain.

22:13.284 --> 22:15.244
Damn you!

22:17.244 --> 22:19.243
Anyone but him!

22:19.244 --> 22:21.244
Get out!

22:49.215 --> 22:50.406
I might have guessed.

22:50.407 --> 22:52.406
Someone has to clear up after you.

22:52.407 --> 22:55.406
You are stopping our letters
from getting to her.

22:55.407 --> 22:58.406
Dear Aunt Matilda is
prostrate with grief and affliction,

22:58.407 --> 23:01.406
such that the reading of begging
letters is medically prohibited.

23:01.407 --> 23:04.406
Yes, in other words.

23:04.407 --> 23:06.231
Mrs Crawley, lovely to see you.

23:08.407 --> 23:10.406
What if she never comes round,
Becks?

23:10.407 --> 23:12.446
What if she cuts me
off without a penny?

23:12.447 --> 23:14.406
Then I'll make your fortune.

23:14.407 --> 23:16.407
Gad, I really think you could.

23:17.927 --> 23:19.407
Oh, look.

23:20.407 --> 23:22.246
A sale!

23:22.247 --> 23:25.406
"Due to the bankruptcy
of John Sedley, stockbroker."

23:25.407 --> 23:28.406
Gad!
Sam!

23:28.407 --> 23:31.406
Hello! Where are the family,
where's Amelia?

23:31.407 --> 23:32.766
Search me.

23:32.767 --> 23:35.406
Mr Sedley went bust and I moved on.

23:35.407 --> 23:37.406
The Three Tuns in Blackfriars,

23:37.407 --> 23:40.247
if you ever find yourself
in need of a pint.

23:41.087 --> 23:42.676
Plenty more stuff in there.

23:44.407 --> 23:45.407
Vultures.

23:45.408 --> 23:48.407
Let's see
if we can afford some of the silver.

23:52.407 --> 23:54.766
Lot 11, for this fine landscape
painting,

23:54.767 --> 23:56.446
gilded frame, artist unknown.

23:56.447 --> 23:58.606
Who wants to start,
who wants to start the bidding.

23:58.607 --> 24:00.926
Oh, Rawdon, I must have this.

24:00.927 --> 24:03.406
You want a fat fellow
on an elephant?

24:03.407 --> 24:05.760
Amelia's brother was
a great pet of mine.

24:07.407 --> 24:09.406
Lot 12 for this beautiful piano,

24:09.407 --> 24:13.406
fine instrument, walnut casing,
well used,

24:13.407 --> 24:15.406
but well looked after,
who's gonna start the bidding then,

24:15.407 --> 24:16.407
ladies and gentlemen?

24:16.408 --> 24:17.606
14 guineas, 14 guineas,

24:17.607 --> 24:19.406
thank you Madam.
Becky.

24:19.407 --> 24:21.926
Amelia knows I never had a piano in
my life, she'd want me to have it.

24:21.927 --> 24:23.406
15, thank you. 16.

24:23.407 --> 24:26.406
That's twice what it's worth.
Shh.

24:26.407 --> 24:28.406
Looking for 17, 20, thank you, sir.

24:28.407 --> 24:32.446
25! 25 guineas then,
ladies and gentlemen,

24:32.447 --> 24:34.406
25 guineas for this fine piano...

24:34.407 --> 24:37.406
I don't know who my rival is,
but he has long pockets.

24:37.407 --> 24:39.406
It's going once, twice.

24:39.407 --> 24:43.406
Well bid, sir. OK, lot 13,

24:43.407 --> 24:46.407
ladies and gentlemen, this high
vase has...

24:58.927 --> 25:00.407
Captain Dobbin!

25:06.407 --> 25:07.643
What a terrible fate.

25:09.407 --> 25:11.407
To lose everything you have.

25:31.407 --> 25:32.446
My piano!

25:32.447 --> 25:35.407
Whoa! Just give me a hand there?

25:38.407 --> 25:39.407
Right you are.

25:39.408 --> 25:41.446
Amelia, what's the meaning of this?

25:41.447 --> 25:44.406
It means that George has not
forgotten me

25:44.407 --> 25:47.407
in spite of everything
that keeps us apart.

25:50.407 --> 25:51.766
You will send that piano back,

25:51.767 --> 25:53.406
you will also send back his letters,

25:53.407 --> 25:54.407
and any trinkets he has given you.

25:54.408 --> 25:56.406
You will make it clear to
Captain George Osborne

25:56.407 --> 25:58.406
that his engagement to you... No!

25:58.407 --> 26:00.446
...his engagement to you is ended.

26:00.447 --> 26:02.246
Mama?

26:02.247 --> 26:03.406
For pity's sake, Mr Sedley,

26:03.407 --> 26:05.406
she shall at least keep her piano.

26:05.407 --> 26:07.766
Is the honour of our family
completely worthless to you?

26:07.767 --> 26:10.406
That the man has made us bankrupt!

26:10.407 --> 26:14.926
Our name can never be united
with that of Osborne, never!

26:14.927 --> 26:16.407
Never!

26:33.407 --> 26:35.406
So what if old Sedley
owes your father a bit of money?

26:35.407 --> 26:38.406
It's more than a bit, Crawley.

26:38.407 --> 26:40.406
I mean, the old man
went down owing father thousands.

26:40.407 --> 26:42.406
Well, your father's got thousands.

26:42.407 --> 26:44.407
And if they were old friends...

26:45.407 --> 26:47.247
What difference does that make?

26:50.407 --> 26:53.406
Gentlemen, any grown man that
loved a woman,

26:53.407 --> 26:56.406
would run off and marry her,
and say damn to all the old rogues,

26:56.407 --> 26:58.407
or am I wrong?

26:59.407 --> 27:01.407
It's not as easy as that.

27:03.407 --> 27:07.406
Young George, here, called her
a wild and desperate flirt,

27:07.407 --> 27:10.406
but the new Mrs Crawley

27:10.407 --> 27:12.407
is making me very happy man.

27:14.247 --> 27:16.406
You got married? To Rebecca?

27:16.407 --> 27:17.447
I did.

27:19.407 --> 27:20.643
Captain Osborne, sir.

27:38.407 --> 27:40.406
'My dearest George,

27:40.407 --> 27:43.406
'my Papa has ordered me to return to
you these presents,

27:43.407 --> 27:46.447
'and I am to write to you
for the last time.

27:48.407 --> 27:49.926
'I release you from an engagement

27:49.927 --> 27:52.407
'that is impossible
in our present misery.

27:54.407 --> 27:56.406
'Goodbye my love.

27:56.407 --> 27:59.406
'I pray to God to bless you always.

27:59.407 --> 28:01.407
'Amelia.'

28:16.447 --> 28:18.407
Make way!

28:26.407 --> 28:30.172
All these years it never occurred
to me I might not marry Amelia.

28:32.087 --> 28:33.406
Yes?

28:33.407 --> 28:34.927
Sir, marching orders.

28:39.407 --> 28:41.406
It was never a decision I made,

28:41.407 --> 28:44.055
nor a decision I ever thought
would be unmade.

28:44.407 --> 28:45.407
It's not all about you, George.

28:45.408 --> 28:47.407
You know her, she'll be...

28:48.407 --> 28:50.407
...fine, won't she?

28:52.407 --> 28:54.407
Captain!

29:01.407 --> 29:03.406
But this is wonderful news!

29:03.407 --> 29:05.406
What, that I'm marching away to war?

29:05.407 --> 29:07.406
This is wonderful news
for our campaign,

29:07.407 --> 29:11.290
which is not against Napoleon,
but against your Aunt Matilda. So...

29:22.407 --> 29:23.407
Right...

29:23.408 --> 29:26.406
My dearest Aunt,

29:26.407 --> 29:28.766
I married a painter's daughter
and I'm not ashamed of the union.

29:28.767 --> 29:31.532
Run me through the body if I am!
Dear old booby.

29:33.407 --> 29:34.407
Before quitting these shores

29:34.408 --> 29:36.606
and commencing a battle which
may prove fatal...

29:36.607 --> 29:38.406
Steady on, Becks!

29:38.407 --> 29:40.525
...I beseech you, before I depart...

29:41.407 --> 29:43.247
...perhaps never to return.

29:48.407 --> 29:50.643
Am I too fast for you?
No, it's just...

29:54.407 --> 29:57.055
...well, it doesn't really
sound much like me.

29:58.607 --> 30:00.927
You want your letter
to sound like you?

30:02.247 --> 30:05.130
Dear Aunt, jolly warm here,
thanks for the cake(!)

30:09.407 --> 30:11.055
Perhaps I am a fool Becky...

30:11.447 --> 30:13.407
...you shouldn't say so.

30:41.407 --> 30:44.231
Oh, you darling,
'beseech' is spelt with two E's.

30:46.407 --> 30:49.406
I ask nothing from you
as the battle begins,

30:49.407 --> 30:51.406
but that we part not in anger.

30:51.407 --> 30:52.446
Believe that I love you for...

30:52.447 --> 30:55.406
"..yourself and not for money's
sake.

30:55.407 --> 30:58.406
"Let me, let me see you
before I go."

30:58.407 --> 31:00.406
That's not Rawdon!

31:00.407 --> 31:03.406
He never wrote me a letter in
his life without asking for money.

31:03.407 --> 31:07.407
But poor Captain Crawley
goes to war! And may perish.

31:08.407 --> 31:11.246
I still think it's romantic.

31:11.247 --> 31:14.407
Star-crossed lovers, and so on.
Briggs!

31:16.407 --> 31:19.406
Oh, Miss Crawley,
do forgive the dear creatures.

31:19.407 --> 31:20.407
Briggs!

31:20.408 --> 31:22.114
Sunlight is bad for invalids.

31:25.407 --> 31:28.407
Let us return
to the Lord for guidance.

31:32.407 --> 31:35.406
"It is not enough to come
forth with a demonstration,

31:35.407 --> 31:37.406
"however pathetic,

31:37.407 --> 31:39.406
"of the evanescent
character of all this..."

31:39.407 --> 31:41.446
Never a clever sort of boy, Rawdon,

31:41.447 --> 31:45.407
but a very, very, affectionate one.

31:47.407 --> 31:50.606
Affectionate enough to marry the
offspring of an opera girl,

31:50.607 --> 31:55.406
which term, though we ladies may
blush to admit we know,

31:55.407 --> 31:56.407
really means...

31:56.408 --> 31:58.406
No! Stop.

31:58.407 --> 32:00.406
Don't be cruel.

32:00.407 --> 32:02.407
...harlot.

32:03.927 --> 32:06.407
Never knows when to stop,
does she, Briggs?

32:24.407 --> 32:27.086
I'll do all the talking, you just
stand there,

32:27.087 --> 32:29.406
and look romantic,
and suffering and tall.

32:29.407 --> 32:30.447
Right.

32:32.407 --> 32:34.406
She's here.
Ugh.

32:34.407 --> 32:35.407
Oh.

32:36.407 --> 32:38.406
Oh, Arabella!

32:38.407 --> 32:40.406
Please forgive me,
it was not my idea to drag you

32:40.407 --> 32:42.406
into our tale of heartbreak and woe.

32:42.407 --> 32:43.407
I can't stay long,

32:43.408 --> 32:45.406
Martha is banished
to Queen's Crawley,

32:45.407 --> 32:48.446
and I am back in favour,
and wish to stay that way.

32:48.447 --> 32:51.927
I wrote to you,
for I only do as my Rawdon bids.

32:53.087 --> 32:54.406
My heart is his forever,

32:54.407 --> 32:57.406
yet soon he marches to war.

32:57.407 --> 33:00.406
Oh!
Oh, Arabella, imagine!

33:00.407 --> 33:03.407
Oh, I do! I do!

33:05.247 --> 33:08.406
I believe my proud friend begins
to regret her breach with you,

33:08.407 --> 33:09.767
Captain Crawley.

33:11.407 --> 33:12.407
Oh, let us make the plan.

33:12.408 --> 33:15.407
Oh! Yes, let's!

33:20.407 --> 33:25.406
My point is a man who can get 10,000
a year by staying at home

33:25.407 --> 33:29.406
is a fool to risk his life abroad.

33:29.407 --> 33:30.766
I am a soldier, father.

33:30.767 --> 33:34.406
Honour demands I must obey
my country's call.

33:34.407 --> 33:38.246
Honour demands you should not marry
that swindling, bankrupt's daughter.

33:38.247 --> 33:39.895
Mr Sedley is not a swindler.

33:42.407 --> 33:45.584
In any case, Miss Sedley has
broken off our engagement.

33:47.407 --> 33:50.406
Oh, then shall all my dreams
come true this night(!) Come.

33:50.407 --> 33:53.525
Yes, I hope you're comfortable where
you're staying...

34:00.407 --> 34:03.406
£200,000.

34:03.407 --> 34:05.927
Diamonds, as big as pigeons' eggs.

34:09.407 --> 34:10.447
Marry her, boy.

34:13.407 --> 34:16.085
Miss Rhoda, pleasure.

34:16.087 --> 34:17.407
Mr Osborne.

34:21.407 --> 34:22.607
So...

34:24.407 --> 34:31.406
You won't find in our humble
mansion that splendour of fare,

34:31.407 --> 34:34.406
to which you are accustomed, my dear
Miss Swartz,

34:34.407 --> 34:37.407
for I am a plain,
humble, British merchant.

34:42.407 --> 34:46.407
We are all creatures of modern
Britain, are we not, Miss Swartz?

34:48.407 --> 34:51.246
We take the places we deserve,

34:51.246 --> 34:54.406
not those to which we were born.

34:54.407 --> 34:56.407
I was born in Barbados.

34:58.407 --> 35:00.086
And do you miss it?

35:00.087 --> 35:02.406
The sun shines more
often over there,

35:02.407 --> 35:05.406
but the education is superior here.

35:05.407 --> 35:09.407
I hope to leave Miss Pinkerton's
very much an English lady.

35:10.407 --> 35:12.406
Miss Pinkerton's in Chiswick?

35:12.407 --> 35:14.466
Mmm, the very same, do you know it?

35:17.407 --> 35:20.819
I wonder if you were ever
friendly with Miss Amelia Sedley?

35:21.407 --> 35:23.086
I was!

35:23.087 --> 35:25.406
The dearest girl,
so kind and generous.

35:25.407 --> 35:27.406
Such friends we were...

35:27.407 --> 35:30.406
What lovely weather
we've had this week.

35:30.407 --> 35:31.525
Almost West Indian.

35:34.247 --> 35:35.659
Choose your course, boy.

35:41.407 --> 35:42.766
Miss Swartz, I love Amelia,

35:42.767 --> 35:45.407
and we've been engaged
almost all our lives.

35:52.407 --> 35:53.407
How dare you, sir?

35:53.408 --> 35:55.926
Dare is not a word to be used
on the eve of war

35:55.927 --> 35:59.406
to a gentleman and an officer of the
British Army.

35:59.407 --> 36:01.406
I shall say what
I like to my own son!

36:01.407 --> 36:05.086
I can cut him off without a shilling
if I like.

36:05.087 --> 36:07.406
I know very well that you give me
plenty of money, sir,

36:07.407 --> 36:10.406
you tell me so often there is no
fear of my forgetting.

36:10.407 --> 36:12.406
I'll have no beggar marriages!

36:12.407 --> 36:14.406
Who told me to love her?

36:14.407 --> 36:15.407
You.

36:15.408 --> 36:17.406
I might indeed have chosen
elsewhere,

36:17.407 --> 36:21.406
and looked higher, perhaps,
in your society, but I obeyed you.

36:21.407 --> 36:25.406
And now that her heart is mine,
you order me to fling it away,

36:25.407 --> 36:27.406
to punish her. To kill her perhaps.

36:27.407 --> 36:29.406
It is a shame, by heavens.

36:29.407 --> 36:30.926
Will you do as I tell you!

36:30.927 --> 36:33.406
Once and for all, sir!

36:33.407 --> 36:37.927
Or will you take your pack
and walk out of this house forever?

36:42.407 --> 36:45.407
I will do as my honour demands.

37:00.407 --> 37:02.606
Perhaps I should have worn the grey.

37:02.607 --> 37:04.406
It's not like you to get nervous.

37:04.407 --> 37:06.760
Perhaps we mistook
the place or the time.

37:09.407 --> 37:11.466
Oh, Miss Briggs is a friend indeed!

37:13.407 --> 37:16.407
Wait, wait for my signal.
Right.

37:22.407 --> 37:24.407
Now!

37:29.407 --> 37:31.246
Gad!

37:31.247 --> 37:32.406
Quick!

37:32.407 --> 37:34.406
Come on, Rawdon, hurry!

37:34.407 --> 37:36.406
It's our one chance!

37:36.407 --> 37:38.407
Let's march on Paris!

37:45.459 --> 37:46.939
Lovely day.

37:52.979 --> 37:56.938
You wish to speak to me? Speak!

37:56.939 --> 38:01.938
Ah. Yes, well, um, just, um, er,

38:01.939 --> 38:05.938
I am sorry, that we've had a, er,

38:05.939 --> 38:07.939
disagreement.

38:09.939 --> 38:10.939
She's a great girl, Aunt,

38:10.940 --> 38:12.938
and I, er,

38:12.939 --> 38:15.298
I couldn't be happier, and all that.

38:15.299 --> 38:18.939
She will betray you,
as she betrayed me.

38:20.299 --> 38:21.939
You must know, Aunt.

38:23.939 --> 38:25.938
I truly married for love.

38:25.939 --> 38:26.939
Ha!

38:26.940 --> 38:28.938
Then you are worse than a fool.

38:28.939 --> 38:31.939
She will drag
you down into the mire.

38:32.939 --> 38:35.939
You're a lost soul, Rawdon.

38:37.939 --> 38:39.175
I'm not without pity.

38:40.939 --> 38:41.939
Attend my lawyer tomorrow.

38:41.939 --> 38:42.939
Driver!

38:50.939 --> 38:51.978
Why did you get down?

38:51.979 --> 38:53.938
Because she told me to.

38:53.939 --> 38:55.938
You could have ridden with her
back to the house,

38:55.939 --> 38:57.938
squired her indoors,
pushed your advantage.

38:57.939 --> 38:59.938
Well, no I couldn't leave
you to get home on your own.

38:59.939 --> 39:01.938
Rawdon, how can you not have
realised I'm perfectly

39:01.939 --> 39:04.938
capable of being left to do
anything by myself?

39:04.939 --> 39:07.939
Unlike me, you mean?

39:10.779 --> 39:12.978
She bade me go to her
lawyers in the morning...

39:12.979 --> 39:15.274
...where there will be
something for me.

39:21.139 --> 39:22.939
Clever old booby.

39:35.939 --> 39:36.939
George.

39:37.939 --> 39:40.939
I've been walking all night.

39:46.939 --> 39:48.618
You are a true friend

39:48.619 --> 39:49.938
and a true gentleman, Dobbin,

39:49.939 --> 39:53.458
and I'm ashamed of how far
I lag behind you.

39:53.459 --> 39:54.938
I beg to impose on your friendship

39:54.939 --> 39:57.175
on a matter of the greatest
importance.

40:29.939 --> 40:32.779
A sight I never thought to see.

40:34.939 --> 40:36.939
Dobbin, I will do the right thing.

40:38.779 --> 40:39.939
Dearest Emmy...

40:41.939 --> 40:42.939
...dearest wife.

40:48.939 --> 40:51.938
What's this? Stop! Stop!

40:51.939 --> 40:53.938
Emmy, please come inside, please!

40:53.939 --> 40:55.979
Stand back, sir, for pity's sake.

41:05.939 --> 41:09.938
It seems to me that for all
the happiest moments of my life,

41:09.939 --> 41:13.938
you have been there.

41:13.939 --> 41:15.938
Did you have a friend to show
you the same

41:15.939 --> 41:17.938
kindness on the eve of your wedding?

41:17.939 --> 41:19.938
I was that fool who rushes in alone

41:19.939 --> 41:22.978
where battalions of angels
fear to tread.

41:22.979 --> 41:24.938
But you are happy, Becky?

41:24.939 --> 41:27.351
Financially,
there's room for improvement.

41:28.939 --> 41:30.938
But you really love him?

41:30.939 --> 41:32.138
Of course!

41:32.139 --> 41:34.938
Though, we are still honeymooning,

41:34.939 --> 41:36.938
there's plenty of time for the
scales to fall from our eyes.

41:36.939 --> 41:40.139
I can't remember
a time before I loved George.

41:41.619 --> 41:46.938
He's always been there.
He's so good. As you are.

41:46.939 --> 41:50.057
I could be good, I could be very
good on £5000 a year.

41:53.139 --> 41:55.938
All will be well, Becky.
In the end.

41:55.939 --> 41:57.939
What can prevent it?

42:26.939 --> 42:28.938
Morning!

42:28.939 --> 42:32.939
You shall be the prettiest
bride in the whole world.

42:34.939 --> 42:37.618
I only wish my family were here.

42:37.619 --> 42:39.458
I have always managed
that one of those.

42:39.459 --> 42:41.939
Now, we have husbands instead.

42:44.939 --> 42:48.618
And so I ask again, when war will
soon break over our heads,

42:48.619 --> 42:51.458
who are you to play with two young
people's affections,

42:51.459 --> 42:52.938
and break their hearts?

42:52.939 --> 42:53.939
I helped that villain's father

42:53.940 --> 42:55.458
when he had not
a shilling to his name,

42:55.459 --> 42:56.938
I'd rather see my daughter
dead at my feet

42:56.939 --> 42:58.938
than married to the son
of an ungrateful enemy.

42:58.939 --> 43:02.138
If you do not give her your consent,
sir, it would be her

43:02.139 --> 43:04.618
loving duty before God
to marry without it.

43:04.619 --> 43:06.938
Together, you and I,
we can stop this marriage,

43:06.939 --> 43:08.298
she listens to you.

43:08.299 --> 43:11.939
You cannot stand in the way
of your daughter's happiness!

43:12.939 --> 43:15.778
Am I to have power over nothing
in this world, Captain Dobbin?

43:15.779 --> 43:18.939
None of us has power over love, sir.

43:27.939 --> 43:28.939
Mistaken?

43:30.939 --> 43:32.938
No. Certainly.

43:32.939 --> 43:34.938
I see.

43:34.939 --> 43:36.938
Your aunt was quite clear.

43:36.939 --> 43:40.939
Clear. Yes. Always.

43:42.939 --> 43:44.939
Please convey my thanks to her.

43:49.939 --> 43:52.938
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
here in the sight of God,

43:52.939 --> 43:55.938
and in the face of this
congregation,

43:55.939 --> 44:01.779
to join together this man,
and this woman, in holy matrimony.

44:06.979 --> 44:12.299
And is commended of St Paul to be
honourable among all men.

44:13.939 --> 44:17.938
Therefore, if any man can
show any just cause why

44:17.939 --> 44:19.938
they may not
lawfully be joined together,

44:19.939 --> 44:21.938
let him now speak,

44:21.939 --> 44:24.138
or else here after,

44:24.139 --> 44:26.939
forever hold his peace.

44:30.939 --> 44:33.939
Wilt thou have this
woman to thy wedded wife?

44:34.939 --> 44:36.299
I will.

44:38.939 --> 44:41.298
Wilt thou have this man to thy
wedded husband?

44:41.299 --> 44:42.939
I will.

44:54.939 --> 44:58.939
I pronounce that they be man
and wife together.

45:18.939 --> 45:19.939
May I kiss the bride too?

45:19.940 --> 45:21.939
Once!

45:24.939 --> 45:26.939
And now it's your turn, William.

45:30.939 --> 45:32.298
Thank you,

45:32.299 --> 45:35.939
for everything you have
done to bring us to this happy day.

45:36.979 --> 45:38.938
£20?

45:38.939 --> 45:41.938
And the letter from her lawyer
saying please leave us alone now.

45:41.939 --> 45:43.938
My entire legacy from Aunt Matilda.

45:43.939 --> 45:46.587
Becks, it's not even
enough to cover the rent!

45:47.939 --> 45:50.458
Oh, we don't want be paying that!
We don't need the place anyway.

45:50.459 --> 45:52.938
No, we don't?
Why not?

45:52.939 --> 45:54.938
Becky, how will we manage now that
we are both married women

45:54.939 --> 45:57.938
but for an instant, before the war
carries our menfolk away?

45:57.939 --> 45:59.938
Nonsense, we'll go with them.

45:59.939 --> 46:02.938
Oh? No, no, I don't think
that's a good idea.

46:02.939 --> 46:04.938
Why not? Plenty of officers
take their wives.

46:04.939 --> 46:06.458
Oh, George, don't let us be parted.

46:06.459 --> 46:10.938
Ah, new adventure, in which Amelia
invades the low countries.

46:10.939 --> 46:12.939
Capital!

46:15.939 --> 46:18.139
Ah! Driver!

46:21.939 --> 46:23.938
We happen to have a spare umbrella.

46:23.939 --> 46:26.938
And so, Captain Dobbin,
you've laboured long

46:26.939 --> 46:30.587
and hard to achieve something I
cannot believe you really want.

46:32.939 --> 46:34.938
I'm, I'm very happy for them both.

46:34.939 --> 46:36.939
Becky?

46:37.939 --> 46:39.939
Shall we? Thank you, my love.
