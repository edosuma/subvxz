SAM'S BLOCKING ME
FROM JOINING THE PRACTICE.

00:15.083 --> 00:18.291
SAM IS NOT BLOCKING YOU.
OH, PLEASE.
VIOLET DOESN'T CARE RIGHT NOW

00:18.333 --> 00:20.834
IF YOU GIVE THE PARTNERSHIP
TO GODZILLA,

00:20.875 --> 00:22.834
ADDISON WOULD SAY IT TO MY FACE,
AND SINCE I'M PAYING

00:22.875 --> 00:25.041
WHAT YOU OWE,
YOU'D BE A FOOL TO BLOCK ME.

00:25.083 --> 00:27.375
THAT LEAVES SAM.
EVERYBODY'S REALLY BUSY,
CHARLOTTE.

00:27.417 --> 00:30.333
WE JUST HAVEN'T HAD TIME
TO DISCUSS IT.
YOU'RE MY MAN ON THE INSIDE.

00:30.375 --> 00:33.041
WORK YOUR MAGIC.

00:33.083 --> 00:36.583
WANT TO PLAY
PYTHON IN THE FOREST?

00:36.625 --> 00:38.583
I'M GONNA STAND UP
VERY SLOWLY NOW.

00:38.625 --> 00:40.125
WOULD YOU LET GO?

00:40.166 --> 00:41.583
YOU REALLY WANT ME TO?

00:41.625 --> 00:44.041
NO, CHARLOTTE. COME ON.
I'M REALLY LATE.

00:44.083 --> 00:46.166
MM.

00:46.208 --> 00:50.667

I WANT TO JOIN THE PRACTICE.

YEAH, YEAH, YEAH ♪

00:54.083 --> 00:56.250

00:56.291 --> 00:59.250
YOU FEEL SICK NOW,
BUT YOU GET ON THE STAND

00:59.291 --> 01:01.250
AND JUST LOOK STRAIGHT
AT THE PROSECUTOR--

01:01.291 --> 01:03.250
ONLY AT HIM.
THAT'S WHAT I DID, OKAY?

01:03.291 --> 01:05.250
VIOLET, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THIS

01:05.291 --> 01:06.834
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO.

01:06.875 --> 01:08.834
NO, I DO, I DO.
I WANT TO.

01:08.875 --> 01:10.083
OKAY.

01:20.250 --> 01:24.000
VIOLET TURNER.

01:28.166 --> 01:30.208
HEY.

01:30.250 --> 01:32.458
SORRY I'M LATE.

01:46.709 --> 01:49.083
PLEASE RAISE YOUR RIGHT HAND.

01:49.125 --> 01:51.083
DO YOU SOLEMNLY SWEAR
TO TELL THE TRUTH,

01:51.125 --> 01:53.166
THE WHOLE TRUTH
AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH?

02:00.250 --> 02:03.041
DR. TURNER...

02:03.083 --> 02:06.166
IT'S CUSTOMARY TO SAY "I DO."

02:15.792 --> 02:18.333
I CAN'T DO THIS.

02:18.375 --> 02:20.083
I...

02:20.125 --> 02:23.291
I CAN'T DO IT.

02:35.625 --> 02:38.000
ANY WORD ON THE TRIAL?
(Addison) NO, NOT YET.

02:38.041 --> 02:40.166
BUT VIOLET'S ON THE STAND
ALL DAY.

02:40.208 --> 02:43.041
OH, UH, I HEARD BACK
FROM STAN PARSONS.

02:43.083 --> 02:46.583
OOH, AND?
HE IS HAPPY WHERE HE IS.

02:46.625 --> 02:49.041
UGH! STAN REALLY WOULD'VE
FIT IN WELL HERE.

02:49.083 --> 02:52.041
WE COULD USE
ANOTHER ORTHO GUY.
YEAH, WELL, WE COULD USE
ANY DOCTOR AT THIS POINT.

02:52.083 --> 02:55.041
LOOK, WHAT IF--
JUST KEEP AN OPEN MIND HERE--

02:55.083 --> 02:58.333
WHAT IF WE JUST...
WENT WITH CHARLOTTE?

02:58.375 --> 03:01.709
YOU CANNOT SERIOUSLY THINK
THAT SHE WOULD FIT IN HERE.

03:01.750 --> 03:06.083
SHE'S SKILLED, SHE'S CONNECTED,
SHE'S A SPECIALTY WE DON'T HAVE.

03:06.125 --> 03:08.625
HEY. WH--

03:08.667 --> 03:11.000
WHAT HAPPENED?
WHY ARE YOU BACK?

03:14.291 --> 03:15.208
WH--

03:15.250 --> 03:17.041
SHE REFUSED TO TESTIFY.

03:17.083 --> 03:20.041
OH. WELL, DID YOU TRY
TO TALK TO HER ABOUT IT?
(Cooper) I TRIED.

03:20.083 --> 03:22.667
WELL, SHE NEEDS SUPPORT,
COOPER. IT'S HARD.

03:22.709 --> 03:24.750
I KNOW IT'S HARD
AND I AM SUPPORTING HER,

03:24.792 --> 03:26.750
BUT SHE WON'T TALK TO ME
ABOUT IT.

03:26.792 --> 03:29.750
SHE WON'T TALK TO ME, EITHER,
AND SHE WON'T TALK TO PETE,

03:29.792 --> 03:31.959
SO LOOKS LIKE IT'S YOUR TURN.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.959
WELL, IF SHE WON'T TALK
TO THEM,

03:34.000 --> 03:36.208
SHE'S NOT GONNA TALK TO ME.

03:36.250 --> 03:39.208
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

03:39.250 --> 03:41.875
NO, THEY TOLD US THAT
YOU'D LEFT THE PRACTICE.

03:41.917 --> 03:44.250
THEY--THEY PROMISED US
THAT YOU'D LEFT THE PRACTICE.
(Amelia) OKAY.

03:44.291 --> 03:46.250
YOU PEOPLE LIED TO US!
SHH.

03:46.291 --> 03:49.041
ZOE, YOU HAVE THIS ALL WRONG.
I DO NOT WORK HERE ANYMORE.

03:49.083 --> 03:51.000
YOU SCREW UP
OUR IMPLANTATIONS,

03:51.041 --> 03:53.834
AND THEN YOU FORCE US TO CARRY
EACH OTHER'S BABIES--
ZOE, PLEASE, JUST...

03:53.875 --> 03:56.041
I'M SORRY. JUST SIT.
I HAVE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.

03:56.083 --> 03:59.041
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE?
NO.

03:59.083 --> 04:02.250
NO, THE APPOINTMENT'S FOR ME.
OUR OBSTETRICIAN--
THINKS THERE MIGHT BE
SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE BABY.

04:02.291 --> 04:04.041
OKAY, WHICH ONE?
(both) MINE.

04:04.083 --> 04:07.083
SORRY. THE--THE BABY
THAT I'M CARRYING, HER SON.

04:07.125 --> 04:09.417
IT GETS A LITTLE CONFUSING
SOMETIMES.

04:09.458 --> 04:11.875
DR. CAREY SAID THAT WE NEEDED
A CONSULT--SURGICAL--

04:11.917 --> 04:15.709
AND THE ONLY ONE
HE'D RECOMMEND WAS YOU.
OKAY, UH, AMELIA,
WHILE YOU'RE HERE,

04:15.750 --> 04:18.041
WE'LL GO AHEAD AND GET
YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE CHECKED.

04:18.083 --> 04:20.458
ZOE, WHY DON'T YOU
COME ON BACK?
OKAY.

04:20.500 --> 04:22.041
(Amelia) OKAY. HMM.

04:22.083 --> 04:24.041
I'M SORRY THAT I BLEW UP.

04:24.083 --> 04:26.041
I-I THOUGHT I WAS OKAY
WITH EVERYTHING,

04:26.083 --> 04:28.458
BUT IT--IT'S BEEN HARD.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.875
MY PREGNANCY,
AMELIA'S PREGNANCY,

04:30.917 --> 04:35.041
AND THEN SEEING NAOMI AGAIN,
I JUST...

04:35.083 --> 04:38.625
SOMETHING IS WRONG, ISN'T IT?
GIVE ME A SECOND.

04:38.667 --> 04:42.125
DR. CAREY DEFLECTED
ALL MY QUESTIONS.
I WON'T DO THAT.

04:43.917 --> 04:46.542
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT IS IT?

04:46.583 --> 04:49.166
IT'S A TERATOMA.
IT'S A KIND OF TUMOR.

04:49.208 --> 04:51.083
SOMETIMES WHEN THE STEM CELLS
DIFFERENTIATE

04:51.125 --> 04:53.083
INTO CARTILAGE, BONE OR FLESH,

04:53.125 --> 04:55.709
THEY END UP
WHERE THEY DON'T BELONG.

04:55.750 --> 04:57.709
AND IN THIS CASE,
THE TUMOR IS LARGE ENOUGH,

04:57.750 --> 05:00.041
THAT IT'S TAKING OVER
THE BABY'S BLOOD SUPPLY.

05:00.083 --> 05:02.041
WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO
IS OPERATE,

05:02.083 --> 05:04.166
TRY TO SEPARATE THE TUMOR
FROM THE FETUS.

05:04.208 --> 05:07.041
AND WILL THAT FIX IT?
WELL, IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

05:07.083 --> 05:09.041
SOMETIMES IT WORKS.
SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T WORK.

05:09.083 --> 05:12.250
BUT WITHOUT SURGERY,
THE BABY WILL DIE.

05:12.291 --> 05:14.250
WELL, THIS IS AMELIA'S
LAST EMBRYO, SO I--

05:14.291 --> 05:17.250
I HAVE TO TELL YOU
THAT IF I DO THE SURGERY,

05:17.291 --> 05:19.250
I'LL NEED TO PERFORATE
THE UTERUS.

05:19.291 --> 05:22.291
SOMETIMES THAT CAN AFFECT YOUR
ABILITY TO CARRY ANOTHER CHILD.

05:22.333 --> 05:24.208
I KNOW IT'S AN AWFUL CHOICE.

05:24.250 --> 05:28.291
YOU'LL WANT TO TALK IT OVER
WITH YOUR HUSBAND, WITH AMELIA.
UH, NO. MARTIN LEFT.

05:28.333 --> 05:31.291
HE NEVER LIKED IT--THE HAVING
EACH OTHER'S BABY THING.

05:31.333 --> 05:35.166
AND HE--HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
THE BOND BETWEEN AMELIA AND I.

05:35.208 --> 05:37.166
IT'S--IT'S LIKE...

05:37.208 --> 05:41.125
BOTH BABIES
BELONG TO BOTH OF US.

05:41.166 --> 05:43.041
I CAN'T DO IT.

05:43.083 --> 05:45.125
MARTIN WILL COME BACK,

05:45.166 --> 05:48.041
AND WE--WE'VE ALWAYS WANTED
A BIG FAMILY.

05:48.083 --> 05:50.041
I JUST CAN'T.

05:50.083 --> 05:53.041
WELL, THEN I'D RECOMMEND
TERMINATING THE PREGNANCY.

05:53.083 --> 05:57.667
(sighs) MY GOD.
WHAT WILL THAT DO TO AMELIA?

05:57.709 --> 06:02.041
AND I--IF WE DO NOTHING,
IT'S GONNA DIE IN THE WOMB?

06:02.083 --> 06:03.333
YES.

06:03.375 --> 06:05.375
THEN I THINK
I SHOULD LET IT

06:05.417 --> 06:07.375
AND GET AMELIA FURTHER ALONG.

06:07.417 --> 06:10.375
I... I CAN'T HAVE HER THINK
THAT I JUST GAVE UP.

06:10.417 --> 06:13.041
I THINK THAT IT'S BETTER
FOR HER TO THINK

06:13.083 --> 06:15.625
THAT IT'S AN ACT OF GOD,
WHENEVER IT HAPPENS.

06:15.667 --> 06:20.041
ZOE, THIS IS AMELIA'S BABY.
SHE HAS THE RIGHT TO KNOW.
IT'S IN MY BODY,
AND I'M YOUR PATIENT.

06:20.083 --> 06:22.125
YOU CAN'T TELL HER
WITHOUT MY PERMISSION.
ZOE--

06:22.166 --> 06:25.000
YOU CAN'T TELL HER.

06:26.583 --> 06:28.583
YOU LOOK LIKE
SOMEBODY SHREDDED YOU.

06:28.625 --> 06:30.583
DID YOU TALK TO VIOLET AGAIN?

06:30.625 --> 06:32.583
NO, NO. I JUST, UH...

06:32.625 --> 06:35.834
REMIND ME NEVER, EVER
TO GO UPSTAIRS AGAIN.

06:35.875 --> 06:37.834
NO, I DIDN'T TALK TO VIOLET.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.834
I-I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY TO HER.

06:39.875 --> 06:42.583
YOU--YOU GONNA HAVE
ANOTHER RUN AT HER?
NOPE. I'M DONE.

06:42.625 --> 06:45.917
I TRIED. I PUSHED.
I... HAD NO EFFECT ON HER.

06:45.959 --> 06:48.083
SO IF SHE WANTS TO LET
KATIE WALK...

06:48.125 --> 06:51.709
PETE, KATIE IS NOT GONNA
WALK AWAY FROM THIS.

06:51.750 --> 06:53.709
NO, BUT THE DEFENSE
WILL LINE UP EXPERTS

06:53.750 --> 06:56.291
WHO WILL SAY SHE WAS CRAZY.
YEAH, WELL, WASN'T SHE?

06:56.333 --> 06:58.583
NOT GUILTY BY REASON
OF INSANITY IS NOT GUILTY,

06:58.625 --> 07:00.625
AND KATIE IS GUILTY.

07:00.667 --> 07:03.083
SIX MONTHS IN A NUT FARM,
SOME MEDS, A LITTLE THERAPY--

07:03.125 --> 07:06.208
AFTER WHAT SHE DID?
THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE.
YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW LONG IT'S GONNA BE.

07:06.250 --> 07:09.208
I MEAN, SHE--SHE--SHE COULD
BE IN THERE FOR YEARS.
I GOT ON THE STAND

07:09.250 --> 07:11.667
AND TOLD THEM ABOUT THE WOUND,
THE BLOOD,

07:11.709 --> 07:14.208
THE BABY GONE,
THINKING VIOLET WAS DEAD.

07:14.250 --> 07:17.208
BUT UNLESS VIOLET TELLS THE JURY
WHAT IT WAS LIKE,

07:17.250 --> 07:19.667
UNLESS THEY HEAR IT
FROM HER--

07:19.709 --> 07:22.875
BUT IF--IF VIOLET IS GONNA BE
TOO TRAUMATIZED...

07:22.917 --> 07:26.041
THEN SHE'LL JUST
KEEP BEING STUCK.

07:26.083 --> 07:28.250
SHE'LL NEVER BE VIOLET.

07:28.291 --> 07:30.208
AND I'LL STILL HAVE A SON

07:30.250 --> 07:33.625
WHOSE MOTHER CAN'T BRING HERSELF
TO CARE ABOUT HIM.

07:33.667 --> 07:37.125
SHE'S MISSING EVERYTHING...
(sighs)

07:37.166 --> 07:39.125
THE LITTLE SOUND HE MAKES
WHEN HE SMILES...

07:39.166 --> 07:43.959
THE WAY HIS EYES TRY TO TAKE IN
THE WHOLE WORLD AT ONCE.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
IT'S JUST GONNA TAKE TIME,
PETE.
WELL, SHE CAN HAVE
AS MUCH AS SHE WANTS.

07:47.041 --> 07:49.917
I'M DONE.

07:53.083 --> 07:56.583
COOPER PUT YOU UP TO THIS?
NO. WE'RE ALL CONCERNED
FOR YOU, VIOLET.

07:56.625 --> 07:58.583
WHY DOES IT MATTER
IF I TESTIFY OR NOT?

07:58.625 --> 08:01.458
WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO SIT THERE
AND RELIVE IT?

08:01.500 --> 08:05.041
WHY AM I THE ONLY PERSON WHO CAN
MAKE SURE KATIE GETS PUNISHED?
WELL, IT'S NOT ABOUT KATIE.
THIS IS ABOUT YOU.

08:05.083 --> 08:07.542
THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S ABOUT ME.
SO SITTING THERE FOR EIGHT,

08:07.583 --> 08:10.291
TEN HOURS A DAY ON THE STAND
WITH KATIE STARING AT ME?

08:10.333 --> 08:13.750
THAT WOULD BE LIKE LIVING
THROUGH IT ALL OVER AGAIN.
AREN'T YOU DOING THAT ANYWAY?

08:13.792 --> 08:16.959
AND DON'T SHRINKS ALWAYS SAY
IT'S GOOD TO--TO TALK?

08:18.542 --> 08:21.041
WELL, WHAT DO SHRINKS KNOW?

08:21.083 --> 08:23.417
I KNOW FACING HER
WILL BE HARD.

08:23.458 --> 08:26.333
BEING ON THE SAME PLANET
WITH HER IS HARD.

08:26.375 --> 08:29.333
ALL RIGHT. WELL, WE COULD
ALL CHIP IN AND GET HER

08:29.375 --> 08:32.208
ONE OF THOSE GUEST TRIPS
TO THE SPACE STATION, ONE-WAY.

08:32.250 --> 08:35.208
WE COULD PROBABLY GET A DISCOUNT
IF IT'S ONE-WAY, RIGHT?

08:35.250 --> 08:38.041
DR. TURNER, THERE'S SOMEONE
HERE TO SEE YOU.
WHO IS IT?

08:38.083 --> 08:41.333
A MR. KENT. HE SAYS TO
TELL YOU HE'S KATIE'S FATHER.
OKAY, UH,

08:41.375 --> 08:44.792
COULD YOU GIVE US
A SECOND, PLEASE?

08:44.834 --> 08:47.041
ALL RIGHT, VIOLET.

08:47.083 --> 08:50.125
VIOLET... IF YOU HAD
A PATIENT IN THIS SITUATION,

08:50.166 --> 08:54.166
WOULD YOU TELL YOUR PATIENT
TO FACE IT OR TO RUN AWAY?

08:54.208 --> 08:56.166
ALL RIGHT,
YOU SEE THAT CHAIR?

08:56.208 --> 08:59.208
I'M GONNA BE SITTING IN IT.

08:59.250 --> 09:02.208
IF YOU NEED HELP,
YOU LOOK AT ME, YOU BLINK,

09:02.250 --> 09:05.375
AND I'LL COME RIDING
TO THE RESCUE, OKAY?

09:05.417 --> 09:08.542
YOU... YOU CAN STILL BLINK,
CAN'T YOU?

09:08.583 --> 09:10.333
CAN YOU...

09:10.375 --> 09:13.458
OKAY.

09:16.667 --> 09:21.083
WHEN DR. WILDER TESTIFIED...

09:21.125 --> 09:24.291
WHAT HE FOUND--
TO HEAR...

09:24.333 --> 09:26.083
IT'S HORRIFYING.

09:26.125 --> 09:30.500
I-I CAN'T APOLOGIZE
TO YOU ENOUGH. JUST...

09:38.709 --> 09:40.667
YOU HELPED HER.

09:40.709 --> 09:44.083
WELL... IF THAT WERE TRUE,
WE WOULDN'T BE SITTING HERE.

09:44.125 --> 09:48.875
NO. NO, SHE COULDN'T
STOP TALKING ABOUT YOU,

09:48.917 --> 09:51.041
HOW YOU JUST KNEW.

09:51.083 --> 09:54.041
YOU KNEW
THAT ALL SHE WANTED

09:54.083 --> 09:56.834
WAS TO HAVE HER BABY
AND...

09:56.875 --> 10:01.125
BE NOT SICK ANYMORE.

10:01.166 --> 10:04.125
SHE TOLD ME I WAS
GOING TO BE SO PROUD OF HER.

10:04.166 --> 10:08.083
SHE SAID, "YOU'LL SEE, DAD.
I'M GONNA BE JUST LIKE MOM."

10:11.083 --> 10:14.542
IF THAT JURY
SENDS HER TO PRISON,

10:14.583 --> 10:17.208
SHE'LL DISAPPEAR.

10:17.250 --> 10:20.875
THIS ILLNESS
WILL EAT HER ALIVE.

10:20.917 --> 10:23.041
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

10:23.083 --> 10:26.458
KATIE WANTS TO SEE YOU.
SHE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU.

10:26.500 --> 10:30.792
SHE SAYS YOU'RE
THE ONLY PERSON WHO UNDERSTANDS.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.917
VIOLET TALKED TO YOU?
YEAH, I GUESS
SHE WAS JUST READY.

10:44.959 --> 10:47.875
YEAH, BUT TO YOU?
LOOK, DO YOU WANT TO HEAR
WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY OR NOT?

10:47.917 --> 10:49.875
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO TESTIFY

10:49.917 --> 10:52.792
BECAUSE SHE'S TERRIFIED
OF FACING KATIE.
THAT'S THE REVELATION?

10:52.834 --> 10:55.041
WE WERE INTERRUPTED.
KATIE'S FATHER SHOWED UP.

10:55.083 --> 10:58.041
WHY? WHAT DID HE WANT?
I DON'T KNOW.

10:58.083 --> 11:01.041
BUT WHEN HE LEFT, SHE WENT
AND HID IN THE LADIES ROOM.

11:01.083 --> 11:04.417
YOU GOT A MINUTE?
UH, YEAH.
JUST, UH, IN ONE MINUTE.

11:04.458 --> 11:06.792
I WAS TALKING TO SAM.

11:06.834 --> 11:10.625
OH, WE'RE JUST IN THE MIDDLE
OF A--
IT'LL ONLY TAKE A SECOND.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.959
I AM A DAMN FINE DOCTOR WITH
AN ESTABLISHED PATIENT BASE,

11:16.000 --> 11:18.959
AND AS I MADE CLEAR, I HAVE
GREAT IDEAS FOR EXPANDING IT.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.959
I HAVE THE CASH TO BUY IN. I'M
CHIEF OF STAFF AT ST. AMBROSE,

11:22.000 --> 11:24.959
SO I CAN STEER YOU SO MANY HEART
SURGERIES, YOU'LL BEG FOR MERCY.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.542
WHY ARE YOU STALLING?
BECAUSE I JUST DON'T THINK
YOU'RE--

11:27.583 --> 11:29.083
YOU'RE THE RIGHT FIT HERE.

11:29.125 --> 11:31.041
YOU KNOW,
WE'RE--WE'RE ALL FRIENDS,

11:31.083 --> 11:34.750
WE--WE RESPECT EACH OTHER,
WE GET ALONG.
UH-HUH.
I GUESS THAT WOULD BE WHY

11:34.792 --> 11:37.667
NAOMI AND PETE COULDN'T
GET OUTTA HERE FAST ENOUGH.

11:37.709 --> 11:40.041
WE NEED SOMEONE WHO IS
GREAT WITH PATIENTS,

11:40.083 --> 11:43.041
SOMEONE WHO'S GREAT WITH STAFF,
SOMEONE'S WHO CALM--
OH, YOU WANT NAOMI.

11:43.083 --> 11:45.041
OKAY, I-I DON'T WANT
TO BE MEAN,

11:45.083 --> 11:48.000
BUT I JUST DON'T LIKE YOU.

11:50.166 --> 11:52.375
OH.

11:52.417 --> 11:54.375
(scoffs) WELL, GOOD GRIEF.

11:54.417 --> 11:57.375
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO
WITH ANYTHING?

11:57.417 --> 12:00.291
(Addison clears throat)
EXCUSE ME.

12:00.333 --> 12:02.875
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT AMELIA AND ZOE.

12:02.917 --> 12:04.041
OKAY.

12:04.083 --> 12:06.041
THIS PLACE IS
A KINDERGARTEN.

12:06.083 --> 12:08.041
IF SOMEBODY'S OFFERING YOU
SOMETHING YOU NEED,

12:08.083 --> 12:10.083
DON'T YOU JUST GRAB AT IT

12:10.125 --> 12:12.041
INSTEAD OF WHINING ABOUT
YOUR DELICATE FEELINGS?

12:12.083 --> 12:13.625
WHAT ON GOD'S GREEN EARTH

12:13.667 --> 12:15.625
DO FEELINGS HAVE TO DO
WITH ANYTHING?

12:15.667 --> 12:18.041
IT'S GOOD FOR YOU
OR IT ISN'T. OH!

12:18.083 --> 12:20.250
YOU AGREE WITH ME?

12:20.291 --> 12:22.041
SURE.

12:22.083 --> 12:24.041
SOMETHING NEEDS DOING,
YOU JUST DO IT.

12:24.083 --> 12:26.083
OTHERWISE, WHAT GOOD ARE YOU?

12:26.125 --> 12:27.917
(door closes)

12:27.959 --> 12:29.500
IT'S AMELIA'S BABY.

12:29.542 --> 12:32.208
ETHICALLY, IT DOESN'T MATTER.
IT'S IN ZOE'S BODY.

12:32.250 --> 12:35.250
ZOE'S MY PATIENT.
I CAN'T BREACH CONFIDENTIALITY.

12:35.291 --> 12:37.875
I HATE THIS. I HATE THAT
THIS BABY IS SICK.

12:37.917 --> 12:41.917
I HATE THAT ZOE WON'T LET ME
EVEN TRY TO FIX IT...

12:41.959 --> 12:43.125
THAT I'M LYING TO AMELIA,

12:43.166 --> 12:45.333
THAT NAOMI'S
CAUGHT UP IN THIS AGAIN.

12:45.375 --> 12:47.417
WE'RE ALL CAUGHT UP IN IT.
IF THIS BABY DIES,

12:47.458 --> 12:49.041
THEN THE SETTLEMENT
GOES OUT THE WINDOW.

12:49.083 --> 12:51.041
IT'S BASED ON THESE TWO WOMEN

12:51.083 --> 12:53.750
BRINGING THESE BABIES TO TERM
AND THEN SWITCHING.

12:53.792 --> 12:56.542
IF THAT CAN'T HAPPEN, THEN WE'RE
FACING A MALPRACTICE SUIT.

12:56.583 --> 13:00.792
SO, NO. LYING TO AMELIA
WILL ONLY MAKE IT WORSE.
I KNOW THAT. I TRIED TO GET
ZOE TO CHANGE HER MIND.

13:00.834 --> 13:02.834
LOOK, NAOMI KNOWS THEM--

13:02.875 --> 13:04.834
DON'T EVEN THINK IT.

13:04.875 --> 13:08.333
YOU SAW HOW HOSTILE ZOE IS.
DO NOT BRING NAOMI IN.

13:08.375 --> 13:10.917
I JUST MEANT TO ASK HER--
IF LITIGATION STARTS AGAIN,

13:10.959 --> 13:14.959
THEY SMELL THAT
NAOMI'S BEEN INVOLVED--
THEY'LL GO AFTER HER FIRST.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.917
THEY'LL GO AFTER HER FIRST.
(sighs)

13:17.959 --> 13:20.125
SO NOBODY KNOWS WHAT
KATIE'S FATHER SAID TO VIOLET

13:20.166 --> 13:22.375
EXCEPT VIOLET,
AND SHE'S NOT TALKING,

13:22.417 --> 13:25.875
EXCEPT TO SAM,
AND NOT ABOUT THAT.
I DIDN'T GET A BABYSITTER
TO TALK ABOUT VIOLET.

13:25.917 --> 13:28.250
ALL RIGHT, WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO TALK ABOUT?
ANYTHING BUT THAT.

13:28.291 --> 13:30.709
UH, WELL, WE COULD TALK ABOUT,
UH, CHARLOTTE, MY BENEFACTOR.

13:30.750 --> 13:33.709
YOU UPSET
BECAUSE SHE PAID YOUR WAY?
NO. I LOVE BEING EMASCULATED.

13:33.750 --> 13:37.041
OKAY, NO VIOLET TALK
AND NO CHARLOTTE TALK.

13:37.083 --> 13:40.583
YOU WANT TO BET ON THE GAME?
IF YOU LOSE,
DO I COLLECT FROM CHARLOTTE?

13:40.625 --> 13:42.041
(man speaking indistinctly
on tv)

13:42.083 --> 13:44.041
(Sam) IF YOU COULD'VE
SEEN HER FACE.

13:44.083 --> 13:47.041
WHO KNEW CHARLOTTE
HAD FEELINGS?
COOPER.

13:47.083 --> 13:50.750
THANKS. THAT HELPS A LOT.
YOU CAN'T TELL
YOUR FRIEND'S GIRLFRIEND

13:50.792 --> 13:53.917
THAT YOU DON'T LIKE HER.
I KNOW, I TRIED... (laughs)
I TRIED TO DODGE HER,

13:53.959 --> 13:56.917
BUT SHE BACKED ME INTO A CORNER
AND KEPT ON TELLING ME

13:56.959 --> 13:59.625
ALL THE REASONS WHY
WE SHOULD HIRE HER AND--
WE SHOULD HIRE HER.

13:59.667 --> 14:02.709
YOU DON'T ACTUALLY
LIKE HER?
I LIKE HER CHECK.

14:02.750 --> 14:05.041
I LIKE THAT HIRING HER
WOULD MAKE COOPER HAPPY.

14:05.083 --> 14:08.041
I LIKE THAT WE WOULD BE MOVING
FORWARD IN AT LEAST ONE AREA.

14:08.083 --> 14:11.542
AND I LIKE HER SPECIALTY.
IT COULD BE GOOD FOR BUSINESS.

14:11.583 --> 14:14.250
LOOK, WE HAVE A PROBLEM.
SHE IS OUR SOLUTION.

14:14.291 --> 14:16.375
UGH.

14:16.417 --> 14:18.750
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
LET'S JUST GET IT OVER WITH.

14:18.792 --> 14:20.250
(Naomi) ADDIE?

14:20.291 --> 14:23.041
UH, HEY, UP HERE.

14:23.083 --> 14:24.959
OH, I'M INTERRUPTING.
MNH-MNH.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.959
MNH-MNH. I WAS
JUST LEAVING, REALLY.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.834
UH, AMELIA CAME TO SEE ME
THIS AFTERNOON.

14:29.875 --> 14:32.667
I WAS SURPRISED, TOO, GIVEN
WHAT HAPPENED THIS MORNING,

14:32.709 --> 14:36.041
BUT, UM, SHE THINKS THERE'S
SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE BABY,

14:36.083 --> 14:38.959
AND SHE THINKS THAT YOU AND ZOE
ARE LYING TO HER ABOUT IT.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.041
OKAY, LOOK, I KNOW
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE OUT OF THIS,

14:42.083 --> 14:45.959
BUT SHE--SHE LOOKS LIKE
SHE'S ABOUT READY TO EXPLODE.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.041
SO... IS SHE RIGHT?
ARE YOU LYING TO HER?

14:49.083 --> 14:50.875
THERE IS A PROBLEM.

14:50.917 --> 14:53.583
THAT WE CAN'T
TELL YOU ABOUT.

14:53.625 --> 14:55.834
OKAY. HOW SERIOUS IS IT?
NAI.

14:55.875 --> 14:59.041
CAN IT BE CORRECTED?
IS IT--
OH, THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
WE'RE PLAYING 20 QUESTIONS.

14:59.083 --> 15:01.709
THEY WERE NAOMI'S PATIENTS,
ALL RIGHT?

15:01.750 --> 15:04.208
LIKE IT OR NOT,
WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

15:04.250 --> 15:07.041
WE EITHER ALL SINK
OR WE ALL SWIM.

15:07.083 --> 15:09.041
IT'S A SACROCOCCYGEAL TERATOMA,

15:09.083 --> 15:12.083
AND IT'S ON THE BABY
THAT ZOE'S CARRYING.
WELL, CAN'T--CAN'T THAT
BE OPERATED ON?

15:12.125 --> 15:15.041
I'D LIKE TO TRY,
BUT ZOE SAID NO.
WELL, THAT CAN'T BE
THE END OF IT.

15:15.083 --> 15:18.041
WELL, LOOK, I KNOW YOU DON'T
WANT ME INVOLVED--
NOT A GOOD BEGINNING
OF A SENTENCE.

15:18.083 --> 15:21.125
AMELIA CAME TO ME,
AND I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

15:21.166 --> 15:22.917
I MEAN, ZOE'S MAD,

15:22.959 --> 15:25.709
BUT SHE WAS MY PATIENT,
AND I DO KNOW HER.

15:25.750 --> 15:28.875
SO GET ME INTO A ROOM WITH HER
AND MAYBE I CAN GET HER

15:28.917 --> 15:31.041
TO CHANGE HER MIND.

15:31.083 --> 15:34.333
YOU--YOU GUYS
HAVE TO LET ME TRY.

15:34.375 --> 15:37.375
(man yelling indistinctly)

15:39.041 --> 15:42.875
(keys jangling)

16:03.333 --> 16:05.000
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

16:07.834 --> 16:09.792
I'M ON MY MEDS.

16:09.834 --> 16:11.709
I'M MYSELF.

16:11.750 --> 16:14.917
I'VE HEARD THAT.

16:18.792 --> 16:20.750
SO YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?

16:20.792 --> 16:23.083
I...

16:23.125 --> 16:24.834
HOW ARE YOU?

16:30.583 --> 16:33.041
OH, D-DR. TURNER,
I AM...

16:33.083 --> 16:35.917
I'M--I'M SO SORRY.

16:35.959 --> 16:39.917
PLEASE... TELL ME YOU KNOW IT
WASN'T ME WHO DID THAT TO YOU.

16:39.959 --> 16:41.917
PLEASE TELL ME YOU KNOW THAT.

16:41.959 --> 16:43.208
WHY?

16:43.250 --> 16:45.208
SO THAT I'LL KNOW
YOU UNDERSTAND

16:45.250 --> 16:47.125
THAT I'M NOT A MONSTER.

16:47.166 --> 16:49.625
THAT'S WHY YOU WANTED
TO SEE ME?

16:49.667 --> 16:52.208
THAT... AND I WANT YOU
TO TESTIFY.

16:52.250 --> 16:55.041
WHEN DR. WILDER
WAS ON THE STAND,

16:55.083 --> 16:58.750
THE JURY LOOKED AT ME
LIKE I AM A MONSTER.
AND YOU THINK MY TESTIMONY
WOULD COUNTERACT THAT?

16:58.792 --> 17:01.166
I THINK IF YOU TESTIFY,
THE JURORS WILL KNOW--

17:01.208 --> 17:03.625
THEY WILL KNOW
THAT I WAS CRAZY THAT NIGHT.

17:03.667 --> 17:06.041
AND YOU'LL AVOID PRISON.
I WON'T GET HELP IN PRISON.

17:06.083 --> 17:08.041
I'LL SLIP.
I'LL BE CRAZY AGAIN.

17:08.083 --> 17:10.041
I-I DON'T EVER WANT
TO BE CRAZY AGAIN.

17:10.083 --> 17:13.000
I'M SCARED.
I'M SCARED OF THAT...

17:13.041 --> 17:15.625
THAT PERSON--
THAT PERSON WHO DID THAT.

17:15.667 --> 17:17.667
IT'S...

17:17.709 --> 17:19.834
IT'S NOT ABOUT
AVOIDING PUNISHMENT.

17:19.875 --> 17:22.959
IT'S JUST... (voice breaking)
I NEED--I NEED HELP.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.125
I NEED SOMEONE ON MY SIDE.

17:26.166 --> 17:28.542
(mutters)

17:28.583 --> 17:31.041
YOU--YOU--YOU--YOU--

17:31.083 --> 17:33.208
YOU GUTTED ME LIKE A PIG.

17:33.250 --> 17:36.250
(voice breaking) YOU RIPPED
MY BABY OUT OF MY BODY.

17:36.291 --> 17:38.250
YOU LEFT ME THERE
TO BLEED TO DEATH,

17:38.291 --> 17:40.834
AND NOW I SHOULD BE
ON YOUR SIDE?

17:40.875 --> 17:44.709
(normal voice) I SHOULD CARE
ABOUT HOW SORRY YOU ARE?

17:44.750 --> 17:47.709
I SHOULD GIVE A DAMN
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU?

17:47.750 --> 17:50.709
YOU MADE MY LIFE HELL.
YOU MADE ME CRAZY.

17:50.750 --> 17:55.083
AND NOW YOU WANT
A FREE PASS FROM ME?

17:57.625 --> 18:00.375
PLEASE, DR. TURNER.

18:00.417 --> 18:02.667
(Katie) PLEASE!

18:02.709 --> 18:06.041
DR. TURNER, PLEASE!

18:09.083 --> 18:10.542
(knock on door)

18:13.667 --> 18:16.667
THANK YOU
FOR AGREEING TO SEE ME.

18:16.709 --> 18:18.667
I KNOW HOW ANGRY YOU ARE,

18:18.709 --> 18:21.625
AND, UH, HOW MUCH YOU BLAME ME,
AND RIGHTFULLY SO--
I DON'T WANT YOUR APOLOGIES.

18:21.667 --> 18:23.041
DR. MONTGOMERY SAID

18:23.083 --> 18:26.083
THAT YOU HAD SOMETHING
THAT YOU NEEDED TO SAY TO ME,

18:26.125 --> 18:29.041
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST SAY IT?
AMELIA CAME TO SEE ME.

18:29.083 --> 18:31.041
YOU TOLD AMELIA?

18:31.083 --> 18:33.041
NO, I TOLD YOU I WOULDN'T.

18:33.083 --> 18:36.041
AMELIA CAME TO ME. SHE KNOWS
YOU'RE HIDING SOMETHING.

18:36.083 --> 18:39.625
SHE KNOWS THAT THERE IS
SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE BABY.
SO NOW YOU WANT TO ATONE

18:39.667 --> 18:42.875
BY TALKING ME INTO SOMETHING
THAT I DON'T WANT TO DO?
ZOE, LISTEN,
WHEN ALL THIS HAPPENED,

18:42.917 --> 18:45.875
I DID NOT WANT TO TALK YOU
INTO KEEPING THE BABY.

18:45.917 --> 18:48.750
ALL I WANTED WAS FOR YOU
TO SEE THINGS FROM ALL SIDES.

18:48.792 --> 18:50.041
IT WAS NOT ABOUT ME.

18:50.083 --> 18:52.041
THIS WAS SO YOU COULD FEEL

18:52.083 --> 18:54.458
AS OKAY WITH WHAT
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN

18:54.500 --> 18:58.041
AS YOU POSSIBLY COULD
GIVEN WHAT WE DID TO YOU--

18:58.083 --> 19:01.041
GIVEN WHAT I DID TO YOU,
WHAT I DID TO YOU.

19:01.083 --> 19:03.917
I WASN'T THE ONE
WHO CHANGED YOUR MIND.

19:03.959 --> 19:05.875
IT WAS AMELIA
AND IT WAS YOU,

19:05.917 --> 19:07.875
KNOWING THAT IT WAS
THE BEST THING

19:07.917 --> 19:09.875
GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

19:09.917 --> 19:12.041
IF THE SITUATION WERE
THE OTHER WAY AROUND,

19:12.083 --> 19:14.041
WOULDN'T YOU WANT
TO KNOW, ZOE?

19:14.083 --> 19:17.083
DON'T YOU SEE?
IT IS THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

19:17.125 --> 19:20.709
THIS IS MY BABY, TOO.
THEY'RE BOTH MINE.

19:20.750 --> 19:22.709
THEY'RE BOTH HERS.
IF I TELL HER NOW--

19:22.750 --> 19:24.709
TELL HER THAT I AM GOING TO
END THIS PREGNANCY--

19:24.750 --> 19:28.417
IT WILL BE BAD FOR HER--
HER BLOOD PRESSURE.

19:28.458 --> 19:30.750
SHE'S ALREADY AT RISK
FOR ECLAMPSIA.

19:30.792 --> 19:33.041
I MAY LOSE BOTH BABIES.
WE'LL LOSE BOTH.

19:33.083 --> 19:38.083
OR I COULD DO THE SURGERY,
AT LEAST TRY.

19:38.125 --> 19:39.375
(sighs)

19:43.083 --> 19:46.917
OKAY, IF YOU'RE GONNA CHOOSE
NOT TO HAVE THE SURGERY,

19:46.959 --> 19:49.959
THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO LET
ADDISON END THE PREGNANCY.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.375
IF YOU EVER WANT TO BE PREGNANT
AGAIN, IT IS THE SAFEST CHOICE.

19:52.417 --> 19:55.458
AND THAT MEANS...
TELLING AMELIA.
OKAY, I'LL TELL HER.

19:55.500 --> 19:58.667
BUT YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO HER
WHY THE SURGERY CAN'T BE DONE.

19:58.709 --> 20:01.041
YOU CANNOT PUT THAT ON ME.

20:07.083 --> 20:09.375
ABOUT CHARLOTTE...

20:09.417 --> 20:11.959
SHE WAS IN A BITCH OF A MOOD
WHEN I GOT HOME LAST NIGHT.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.959
COOPER, I'M SORRY.
I DON'T WANT YOUR APOLOGY.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.041
JUST MAKE A DECISION
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

20:16.083 --> 20:18.125
IS SHE IN OR IS SHE OUT?
COME ON.

20:18.166 --> 20:20.750
WE DID. YEAH, WE CALLED HER
THIS MORNING.

20:20.792 --> 20:22.500
SHE... SHE DIDN'T TELL YOU?

20:22.542 --> 20:26.041
UH, NO. I LEFT EARLY FOR ROUNDS.
WHAT IS IT, YES OR NO?

20:26.083 --> 20:29.959
SHE'S MOVING IN TO PETE'S
OLD OFFICE RIGHT NOW.

20:33.083 --> 20:36.458
YOU COULDA CALLED ME.

20:36.500 --> 20:38.041
CONGRATULATIONS.

20:38.083 --> 20:39.583
I WANTED TO SURPRISE YA.

20:39.625 --> 20:41.625
UH, JUST ANYWHERE
EXCEPT FOR THAT ONE.

20:41.667 --> 20:44.041
IT GOES ON THE DESK.

20:44.083 --> 20:46.041
WOW. (chuckles)

20:46.083 --> 20:47.458
THIS IS, UH,

20:47.500 --> 20:49.667
THIS IS GONNA BE GREAT.

20:49.709 --> 20:53.041
WAIT TILL YOU SEE WHAT I GOT
GOING ON IN HERE.

20:53.083 --> 20:55.083
UM, IS THIS WHAT I THINK
IT IS?

20:55.125 --> 20:58.208
YES.

20:58.250 --> 21:00.709
WHAT IS THIS FOR?

21:00.750 --> 21:03.041
I MEAN, WHY IS IT HERE?

21:03.083 --> 21:05.458
NEW JOB, NEW SPECIALTY.
PORN SHOP?

21:05.500 --> 21:07.041
SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION.

21:07.083 --> 21:08.458
YOU'RE A UROLOGIST.

21:08.500 --> 21:12.125
THAT AND NOW MORE. LOOK.
I HIRED A WEB DESIGNER.

21:12.166 --> 21:15.125

A CONDITION, GET INFORMATION.

21:21.083 --> 21:23.667
YOU BEEN THINKING ABOUT
THIS ONE FOR A WHILE?
YES.

21:23.709 --> 21:26.041
YOU DIDN'T THINK
TO MENTION THIS TO ME?

21:26.083 --> 21:28.709
IT JUST SLIPPED YOUR MIND?
IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS.

21:28.750 --> 21:31.041
AND WHAT DO YOU CALL IT? WHAT,
IS IT, LIKE, UH, GENITOLOGY?

21:31.083 --> 21:32.959
CAN'T-FUNCTION-OLOGY?
SEXOLOGY.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.583
IS THAT WHAT IT'S GONNA SAY
ON YOUR BUSINESS CARD--

21:35.625 --> 21:38.041
DR. CHARLOTTE KING,
SEXOLOGIST?

21:38.083 --> 21:41.166
KINDA SOUNDS A LITTLE BIT LIKE
A HOOKER OR A DOMINATRIX.

21:41.208 --> 21:43.166
YOU DID NOT JUST CALL ME
A HOOKER.

21:43.208 --> 21:46.166
NO, I SAID IT SOUNDS
A LITTLE BIT LIKE A HOOKER.
FOR GOD SAKES, COOPER.

21:46.208 --> 21:48.875
THIS IS A LEGITIMATE
MEDICAL SPECIALTY.

HAVE TROUBLE WITH SEX.

21:55.625 --> 21:58.041
THEY NEED A DOCTOR'S HELP.
I EMPHASIZE "DOCTOR."

21:58.083 --> 22:00.375
YOU KNOW WHAT?
UM, LET'S TABLE THIS.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.166

22:04.208 --> 22:07.041

22:09.083 --> 22:13.041
OH, GOOD. YES. SEE? THAT MEANS
YOU HAVE TO ANSWER ONE QUESTION.

22:13.083 --> 22:16.041
YOU STILL DON'T WANT
TO TALK TO ME?
NO, IT'S--IT'S NOT THAT.

22:16.083 --> 22:18.041
I'M JUST AFRAID
YOU'RE GONNA PRESSURE ME

22:18.083 --> 22:21.041
INTO DOING SOMETHING
I DON'T WANT TO DO.
YEAH, BUT SAM--
YOU TALKED TO SAM.

22:21.083 --> 22:23.041
NO PRESSURE.
I WILL NOT PRESSURE YOU.

22:23.083 --> 22:25.834
PROMISE.

22:25.875 --> 22:27.500
OKAY.

22:27.542 --> 22:29.542
WHAT'S THE QUESTION?

22:29.583 --> 22:33.125
WHY... DID KATIE'S FATHER
COME IN TO SEE YOU?

22:33.166 --> 22:36.083
TO TELL ME THAT
KATIE WANTS TO SEE ME.

22:36.125 --> 22:39.375
AND DID HE REALLY THINK
YOU WERE GONNA GO?
I DID GO.

22:39.417 --> 22:41.583
I THOUGHT THAT...

22:41.625 --> 22:45.041
IF I COULD FACE HER--
JUST US--

22:45.083 --> 22:47.041
THEN I COULD FACE HER
IN THE COURT.

22:47.083 --> 22:49.959
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?
I WOULD'VE GONE WITH YOU.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.583
HOW'D IT GO?

22:51.625 --> 22:54.750
I WANTED TO RIP HER LUNGS OUT,
BUT THE DEPUTY WAS THERE.

22:54.792 --> 22:58.166
WELL, THAT'S PROBABLY
A GOOD THING... FOR KATIE.
SHE WANTS TO ME TESTIFY.

22:58.208 --> 23:00.417
SHE WANTS ME TO SAY
THAT SHE'S CRAZY.

23:00.458 --> 23:04.083
AND... WHAT DO YOU WANT?

23:05.875 --> 23:08.458
WELL, DR. TURNER THINKS
SHE NEEDS HELP.

23:08.500 --> 23:11.041
BUT VIOLET WANTS HER DEAD.

23:11.083 --> 23:13.458
YOU CAN HAVE CONFLICTING
EMOTIONS ABOUT A PERSON.

23:13.500 --> 23:15.250
I SPEAK FROM EXPERIENCE.

23:15.291 --> 23:18.500
YEAH, BUT ONLY ONE OF US
CAN TESTIFY.

23:21.083 --> 23:23.750
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

23:25.834 --> 23:29.458
WELL, I THINK DR. TURNER'S
THE BEST PSYCHIATRIST I KNOW.

23:29.500 --> 23:32.000
BUT I WANT
WHAT'S BEST FOR VIOLET.

23:35.417 --> 23:38.375
THE TERATOMA DEPLETES
THE BABY'S BLOOD SUPPLY,

23:38.417 --> 23:41.417
AND THE FETUS CAN'T DEVELOP
OR THRIVE.

23:41.458 --> 23:43.667
AND THE BABY DIES?

23:43.709 --> 23:46.083
AMELIA, I WANTED TO TELL YOU.
I WAS--
AND IS--

23:46.125 --> 23:48.917
IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO
EXCEPT FOR THE SURGERY?

23:48.959 --> 23:51.083
I WISH THERE WERE.

23:51.125 --> 23:54.417
IF I THOUGHT
THAT THERE WAS A WAY--
NO, I UNDERSTAND. I DO.

I'M JUST--I'M A LITTLE
LIGHT-HEADED, I THINK.

24:03.083 --> 24:06.750
I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND TAKE
YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE NOW, OKAY?
OKAY.

SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

IS BEST.

IN BLOOD PRESSURE.

IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT.

31:30.542 --> 31:33.625
LISTEN, ALL OF THIS,
IT JUST HAPPENED.

31:33.667 --> 31:36.291
OKAY? COME HERE.

31:36.333 --> 31:38.500
MICHAEL IS STILL HERE.

31:38.542 --> 31:40.500
YOUR BABY IS FINE.

THE BABY?

31:53.834 --> 31:56.041
YOU COME BACK NOW?
AMELIA--

31:56.083 --> 32:00.667
NO, THIS ISN'T RIGHT.
NOW THAT THE BABY'S GONE?
NO, AMELIA, IT'S OKAY.

32:00.709 --> 32:04.208
HE LEFT YOU.
NO, I CALLED HIM.
I WANTED HIM TO COME.

GO THROUGH THIS ALL ALONE.

32:30.250 --> 32:32.125
I'M JUST THE SURROGATE.

32:32.166 --> 32:34.667
NO, NO. YOU'RE MUCH MORE
THAN THAT.
I THOUGHT I WAS.

32:34.709 --> 32:36.917

THAT'S--THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT?

32:36.959 --> 32:40.083

32:42.500 --> 32:45.041
AMELIA.

LOTS OF KIDS.

32:45.083 --> 32:47.041
AMELIA,
HE IS NOT YOUR BABY.

32:47.083 --> 32:50.041
YOU CANNOT JUST LEAVE
AND KEEP HIM.

32:50.083 --> 32:53.000
YES, I CAN.

32:54.542 --> 32:57.000
HE'S NOT YOURS.

32:57.041 --> 33:00.250
HE'S ALL I HAVE LEFT.

33:07.750 --> 33:10.542
THE LAST THING I REMEMBER
WAS HER WALKING OUT OF THE DOOR

33:10.583 --> 33:12.041
WITH THE BABY.

33:12.083 --> 33:14.417
NOTHING MORE?

33:14.458 --> 33:16.500
JUST BLOOD.

33:16.542 --> 33:20.417
I REMEMBER THE BLOOD...

33:20.458 --> 33:22.041
SPREADING OUT...

33:22.083 --> 33:23.709
ALL AROUND ME.

33:26.750 --> 33:29.333
(man)
THANK YOU, DR. TURNER.

33:29.375 --> 33:32.583
YOU AND DR. WILDER WERE
TREATING THE DEFENDANT,

33:32.625 --> 33:34.500
IS THAT RIGHT?
YES.

33:34.542 --> 33:37.917
AND YOU FELT IT WAS SAFE FOR HER
TO STOP TAKING HER MEDICATIONS?

33:37.959 --> 33:41.208
SHE REFUSED TO TAKE THEM.
SHE WAS AFRAID

33:41.250 --> 33:44.583
THAT THEY WOULD HARM THE BABY
THAT SHE WAS CARRYING.
DID YOU UNDERSTAND
THAT SHE HAD AN ILLNESS

33:44.625 --> 33:47.834
THAT REQUIRED MEDICATION?
I UNDERSTOOD THAT SHE COULD
BENEFIT FROM MEDICATION.

33:47.875 --> 33:50.166
DID SHE UNDERSTAND
THAT SHE WOULD BENEFIT--
OBJECTION. SPECULATION.

33:50.208 --> 33:53.041
YOUR HONOR, THE WITNESS
IS NOT JUST A VICTIM.

33:53.083 --> 33:54.875
SHE WAS THE DEFENDANT'S
PSYCHIATRIST.

33:54.917 --> 33:57.417
SHE'S AN EXPERT
IN MENTAL ABERRATIONS.

33:57.458 --> 33:59.834
I'LL ALLOW IT.

33:59.875 --> 34:02.041
WERE YOU AWARE THAT WITHOUT
PROPER MEDICATION,

34:02.083 --> 34:05.542
YOUR PATIENT WOULD LIKELY
LAPSE INTO A DELUSIONAL STATE?

34:05.583 --> 34:08.625
L-LIKELY IS NOT QUITE
THE RIGHT WORD.
ALL RIGHT.

34:08.667 --> 34:11.000
DO YOU THINK IT WAS POSSIBLE
FOR HER TO BECOME DELUSIONAL?

34:11.041 --> 34:13.542
YOUR HONOR, COUNSEL IS TRYING
TO BLAME THE VICTIM

34:13.583 --> 34:16.041
FOR NOT BEING CLAIRVOYANT.
I'LL REPHRASE.

34:16.083 --> 34:18.792
DR. TURNER,
IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION,

34:18.834 --> 34:22.834
ON THE NIGHT IN QUESTION,
WAS THE DEFENDANT DELUSIONAL?

34:31.834 --> 34:33.166
YES.

34:33.208 --> 34:36.625
(gallery murmuring)

34:36.667 --> 34:39.250
YES, SHE WAS.

34:39.291 --> 34:42.375

35:01.166 --> 35:04.041
DR. TURNER.

35:04.083 --> 35:05.291

35:08.792 --> 35:11.041
I HATE WHAT YOU DID TO ME.

35:11.083 --> 35:13.834
SO DO I.

35:13.875 --> 35:17.083
SO WHY?

35:17.125 --> 35:19.417
BECAUSE YOU WERE RIGHT.

35:19.458 --> 35:22.917
IT WASN'T YOU THAT NIGHT.

35:22.959 --> 35:27.458
IF I HAD SAID
YOU WERE JUST...

35:27.500 --> 35:29.959
EVIL...

35:30.000 --> 35:33.375
IT WOULD BE LIKE DENYING
EVERYTHING I DO.

35:33.417 --> 35:35.375
MORE THAN ANYONE,

35:35.417 --> 35:39.041
I'M SUPPOSED TO UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU WEREN'T YOU.

35:39.083 --> 35:42.000
AND I DO UNDERSTAND.

35:44.083 --> 35:46.792
BECAUSE I'M NOT ME EITHER.

35:49.375 --> 35:52.166
I HOPE YOU GET BETTER.

35:53.792 --> 35:56.625
I HOPE YOU GET BETTER, TOO.

36:00.875 --> 36:02.750
PERFECT.
YOU GIVE HER OUR BABY,

36:02.792 --> 36:06.041
SHE WALKS AWAY,
AND THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO.

36:06.083 --> 36:09.041
GOD KNOWS WHAT SHE'S
GONNA DO TO HIM.
SHE'S NOT GONNA HURT
THE BABY, MARTIN.

36:09.083 --> 36:13.417
SHE STOLE OUR BABY.
HOW CAN YOU BE THIS CALM?
CALM? I JUST LOST A BABY.

36:13.458 --> 36:17.333
AND WE'RE GONNA FIND HER
AND WE'RE GONNA GET IT BACK.
MARTIN, I WASN'T TALKING
ABOUT THAT BABY.

36:17.375 --> 36:20.417
I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE ONE
I WAS CARRYING.
HER BABY.

36:20.458 --> 36:23.041
HERS. MINE. I-I KNOW IT'S
HARD FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND,

36:23.083 --> 36:26.333
BUT WHEN A CHILD GROWS INSIDE
YOU, YOU FEEL LIKE IT'S YOURS.

36:26.375 --> 36:28.166
YOU'RE DEFENDING HER?
I'M UNDERSTANDING HER.

36:28.208 --> 36:30.458
MARTIN--
WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA SAY NOW?

36:30.500 --> 36:32.458
BECAUSE YOU KNOW
THE SETTLEMENT'S OUT THE WINDOW.

36:32.500 --> 36:35.375
THIS WAS NEVER ABOUT THAT,
MARTIN, FOR EITHER OF US.

36:35.417 --> 36:38.417
MARTIN--
WHAT? THAT'S OUR BABY.

36:38.458 --> 36:40.333
AND WE'LL GET HIM BACK.
WE WILL.

36:40.375 --> 36:42.834
SHE'S A GOOD PERSON, MARTIN.

36:42.875 --> 36:45.792
SHE'LL LOOK AT HIM, AND SHE'LL
KNOW THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
HOW CAN YOU EXCUSE HER?

36:45.834 --> 36:47.792
YOU RUSH IN HERE
AFTER MONTHS OF BEING AWAY,

36:47.834 --> 36:49.792
AND YOU'RE JUST HAPPY
THAT I'M OKAY.

36:49.834 --> 36:52.125

36:54.166 --> 36:57.583

MARTIN, YOU'RE MY HUSBAND,

36:59.500 --> 37:03.291

SO GLAD THAT YOU'RE BACK,

37:03.333 --> 37:05.250

37:05.291 --> 37:07.041

TO HER.
