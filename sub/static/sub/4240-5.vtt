Here's what happened last week.

00:03.295 --> 00:04.754
Quinn told Finn—
I'm pregnant.

00:04.838 --> 00:07.882
- But she didn't tell him
he's not the father— Puck is.
- What's up, MILF?

00:07.966 --> 00:09.759
-Can you believe that?
-Wow.
-That's not the only baby drama.

00:09.843 --> 00:12.679
Terri says she's pregnant,
but really she's faking
and Mr. Schuester doesn't know.

00:12.763 --> 00:14.472
Oh, my God.

00:14.556 --> 00:16.891
Rachel quit the Glee Club
because Sue got Sandy to
come back to direct a musical.

38:43.822 --> 38:45.406
I—

38:45.490 --> 38:49.535
I, uh— I screwed up
bringing her here.

38:49.619 --> 38:52.871
It was about me,
and Glee Club is supposed
to be about you guys.

38:52.956 --> 38:55.374
You don't need her
to be great.

38:55.458 --> 38:57.543
But we need her
for the second act.

38:57.627 --> 39:00.254
I'll just tell them
we had to cut the show short.

39:01.131 --> 39:03.924
Hey, guys,
you were great!

39:05.093 --> 39:06.719
Don't worry.

39:06.803 --> 39:08.762
There will be
other performances.

39:08.847 --> 39:11.348
Excuse me.

39:11.433 --> 39:13.934
I think I might
have a solution.

39:14.019 --> 39:17.771
In show business,
when a star can't perform
her understudy steps in.

39:19.232 --> 39:21.608
I'd be happy to go on for April,
if you’d let me.

39:21.693 --> 39:24.069
Since when are you willing
to be an understudy?

39:24.154 --> 39:27.406
- Since I quit the play.
- Really? Why?

39:30.118 --> 39:33.495
I realized being a star
didn't make me feel as special
as being your friend.

39:36.499 --> 39:40.919
If I'd let you down
when you needed me the most,
I'd never forgive myself.

39:43.131 --> 39:45.340
I know all the words
to the song.

39:45.425 --> 39:46.967
You don't know
the choreography.

39:49.888 --> 39:52.306
Then we're gonna
have to give her
a lot of help out there.

39:59.064 --> 40:00.814
Go get in your costume.

40:02.817 --> 40:04.735
Excuse me.
