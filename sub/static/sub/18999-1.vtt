01:50.280 --> 01:52.240
In other parts of the world,

01:52.365 --> 01:55.201
young men leave home and
travel far and wide...

01:55.285 --> 01:58.038
in search of a promising future.

01:58.121 --> 02:02.584
Their journeys are often fuelled
by dreams of triumphing over evil,

02:02.667 --> 02:04.794
finding a great love...

02:04.878 --> 02:08.381
or the hope of
fortunes easily made.

02:08.506 --> 02:13.386
Here in St. Cloud's, not even the decision
to get off the train is easily made,

02:13.511 --> 02:17.557
for it requires an earlier,
more difficult decision...

02:17.641 --> 02:21.936
add a child to your life
or leave one behind.

02:22.020 --> 02:25.857
The only reason people journey
here is for the orphanage.

02:25.982 --> 02:28.193
- Good morning.
- We have an appointment.

02:28.318 --> 02:30.987
Yes. Come in. Welcome to St.
Cloud's.

02:31.071 --> 02:33.531
We're going right
upstairs to see Dr Larch.

02:33.657 --> 02:36.117
I came as a physician to
the abandoned children...

02:36.242 --> 02:39.496
and unhappily pregnant women.

02:39.579 --> 02:42.123
I had hoped to become a hero.

02:42.248 --> 02:45.752
But in St. Cloud's, there
was no such position.

02:45.835 --> 02:48.588
In the lonely, sordid
world of lost children,

02:48.672 --> 02:51.758
there were no
heroes to be found.

02:51.841 --> 02:54.219
And so I became the
caretaker of many,

02:54.344 --> 02:56.388
father of none.

02:56.471 --> 02:59.766
Well, in a way, there was one.

02:59.849 --> 03:01.893
Here he is.

03:01.977 --> 03:04.604
His name was Homer Wells.

03:04.688 --> 03:09.109
I named him after
the Greek writer.

03:09.192 --> 03:11.236
You know, Homer, of course?

03:13.154 --> 03:17.784
And I made his name Wells
because I could tell he was...

03:17.867 --> 03:20.537
very deep.

03:20.620 --> 03:22.622
In truth, Nurse
Angela named him.

03:22.706 --> 03:25.959
Her father drilled wells, and she
once owned a cat named Homer.

03:26.042 --> 03:28.294
Bye-bye, Homer.

03:33.049 --> 03:36.094
- Good night, you Princes of Maine,
- Can we see the doctor?

03:36.177 --> 03:39.097
You Kings of New England.

03:39.180 --> 03:41.433
- Good night.
- Doctor?

03:41.516 --> 03:44.811
Doctor? There's something
wrong with him.

03:44.894 --> 03:48.148
- He never makes a sound.
- He didn't cry.

03:48.231 --> 03:51.776
Orphan babies learn
there's no point in it.

03:51.860 --> 03:55.196
Do you think we could have a look
at someone a little different?

04:01.703 --> 04:05.665
Thus was Homer Wells returned.
He was too happy a baby.

04:05.749 --> 04:08.293
Bye, Homer.

04:08.376 --> 04:13.131
The second family to adopt him had a
gift for getting sounds out of Homer.

04:13.214 --> 04:15.634
They beat him.

04:15.717 --> 04:18.094
He couldn't stop crying.

04:18.178 --> 04:21.680
Shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh.

04:24.434 --> 04:27.103
It's okay now.

04:27.187 --> 04:29.689
Nobody's gonna hurt you any more

04:29.773 --> 04:33.860
Here in St. Cloud's, I try to consider
with each rule I make or break...

04:33.943 --> 04:37.530
that my first priority
is an orphan's future.

04:37.614 --> 04:41.034
Twice adopted, twice returned.

04:41.117 --> 04:43.495
It didn't bode well.

04:47.457 --> 04:52.045
And yet it was always clear to
me that he was a special boy.

04:52.128 --> 04:55.382
Near the angle of the rib.
And...

04:55.465 --> 04:57.884
- It was with Homer's future in mind...
- Homer?

04:57.968 --> 05:02.305
- That I began his tutorials.
- If you're going to stay at St. Cloud's,

05:02.389 --> 05:04.474
I expect you to be of use.

05:04.557 --> 05:07.352
I admit that our
lessons were, in part,

05:07.435 --> 05:11.982
- the simple expression of a father's love.
- Homer.

05:12.065 --> 05:14.859
But in failing to
withhold love...

05:14.943 --> 05:17.904
and making the
orphanage his home,

05:17.988 --> 05:23.410
had I created a true and
everlasting orphan?

05:23.493 --> 05:26.705
- No!
- Keep breathing. You're gonna be okay.

05:26.788 --> 05:30.583
And so my excellent pupil learned
to look after abandoned children...

05:30.667 --> 05:34.671
- and to deliver unwanted babies.
- Relax!

05:34.754 --> 05:38.341
Long ago, I had decided
that sometimes...

05:38.425 --> 05:41.344
it was the women who
needed to be delivered.

05:48.351 --> 05:51.354
I chose my own path.

05:51.438 --> 05:54.899
No one would ever
choose for Homer Wells.

06:08.038 --> 06:11.291
I saw the splendour
of the moonlight

06:11.374 --> 06:16.296
On Honolulu Bay

06:16.379 --> 06:19.549
There's something
tender in the moonlight

06:19.632 --> 06:24.429
On Honolulu Bay

06:24.512 --> 06:29.142
And all the beaches
are full of peaches

06:29.225 --> 06:33.229
Who bring their youth along

06:33.313 --> 06:36.483
And in the glimmer
of the moonlight

06:36.566 --> 06:41.655
They love to sing this song

06:41.738 --> 06:47.661
If you like the Ukulele Lady

06:47.744 --> 06:52.624
- Ukulele Lady like you
- Dr Larch!

06:55.085 --> 06:57.712
Dr Larch!

07:00.090 --> 07:02.676
Dr Larch?

07:02.759 --> 07:05.095
We have two new patients.

07:05.178 --> 07:07.639
- One to deliver.
- Coming.

07:09.557 --> 07:12.686
- First pregnancy?
- Yes, for both.

07:12.769 --> 07:16.106
I presume you'd prefer
handling the delivery?

07:16.189 --> 07:18.858
All I said was, I don't
wanna perform abortions.

07:18.942 --> 07:21.486
I have no argument with
you performing them.

07:21.569 --> 07:24.864
You know how to help these women.
How can you not feel obligated...

07:24.948 --> 07:27.534
to help them when they can't
get help anywhere else?

07:27.617 --> 07:32.038
One: It's illegal. Two: I didn't ask
how to do it. You just showed me.

07:32.122 --> 07:36.501
What else could I have shown you, Homer? The
only thing I can teach you is what I know.

07:36.584 --> 07:40.380
In any life, you
have to be of use.

07:40.463 --> 07:42.716
Of use? Of use.

07:44.718 --> 07:49.556
That was good, Carla. That was perfect.
Everything's gonna be fine.

07:49.639 --> 07:53.518
- I don't wanna see it.
- You don't have to see it, dear. Don't worry.

07:53.601 --> 07:57.355
I don't even wanna know what
sex it is, so don't tell me!

07:57.439 --> 08:01.234
- We won't tell you. You're gonna be okay.
- Your baby's gonna be okay too.

08:01.318 --> 08:04.404
- I don't wanna know!
- That's a big boy.

08:04.487 --> 08:07.365
Let me see him.

08:07.449 --> 08:09.534
I wanna see him.

08:11.161 --> 08:13.872
- Would you mind joining me in the nursery?
- Okay.

08:17.917 --> 08:20.879
Wilbur, the adopting couple
is waiting in your office.

08:20.962 --> 08:25.008
Life is waiting. Let 'em wait.

08:25.091 --> 08:27.093
Where's the name sheet?

08:27.177 --> 08:29.512
Uh, nobody's named this one yet.

08:29.596 --> 08:35.434
Oh, it's my turn. Henceforth,
you shall be Little Dorrit.

08:35.518 --> 08:37.854
Oh.

08:37.937 --> 08:40.273
No, you don't like that, do you?

08:40.357 --> 08:42.859
He's a boy, that's why.

08:42.942 --> 08:45.195
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?

08:45.278 --> 08:48.114
- I don't think so.
- You do it.

08:48.198 --> 08:50.575
Okay.

08:50.659 --> 08:54.120
Henceforth, you shall
be Little Wilbur.

08:57.332 --> 08:59.292
I'm not crazy about
the "Little."

08:59.376 --> 09:02.545
Okay, just Wilbur then.

09:02.629 --> 09:07.550
We haven't had a Wilbur in a year or
so, have we? We used to have dozens.

09:07.717 --> 09:10.136
He sniffs that ether.
I've seen him do it.

09:10.220 --> 09:12.973
It's because he's too tired to sleep.
He has to.

09:13.056 --> 09:15.141
He smells like he could
put you to sleep.

09:15.225 --> 09:17.978
He's a doctor, Buster.
Doctors smell like ether.

09:18.061 --> 09:20.730
- You're a doctor, Homer. You don't smell like ether.
- I'm not a doctor.

09:20.814 --> 09:24.109
I haven't been to medical school. I
haven't even been to high school.

09:24.192 --> 09:28.822
- But you've studied with the old man for years.
- I'm not a doctor.

09:29.906 --> 09:31.825
I'm sorry, Homer.

09:31.908 --> 09:33.952
I saw the splendour
of the moonlight

09:35.161 --> 09:37.163
On Honolulu Bay

09:37.247 --> 09:39.332
Fuzzy is not uncommon.

09:39.416 --> 09:44.504
There's something about the premature
babies of alcoholic mothers.

09:44.587 --> 09:47.590
They seem to be susceptible to
every damn thing that comes along.

09:47.674 --> 09:50.468
I haven't read that.

09:50.552 --> 09:53.596
I haven't either, but you will.

09:53.680 --> 09:57.142
Those morons who write the books
ought to do some research here.

09:57.225 --> 09:59.769
Isn't Fuzzy just underdeveloped?

09:59.853 --> 10:02.022
When doesn't he have bronchitis?

10:02.105 --> 10:06.443
I wouldn't call his bronchial
infection underdeveloped, would you?

10:06.526 --> 10:09.321
Come on, Fuzz.

10:09.404 --> 10:12.615
Here we go. Feet up.

10:12.699 --> 10:14.951
There you are.

10:15.035 --> 10:17.829
- What's going on here?
- Sit up straight.

10:20.290 --> 10:24.627
Wilbur? Wilbur, can you
come out here, please?

10:24.711 --> 10:27.839
There you go.

10:27.922 --> 10:31.635
- Hi, Homer.
- Hey. What is it, Mary Agnes?

10:31.718 --> 10:35.555
Now calm down.

10:35.639 --> 10:39.559
- What is it?
- Look.

10:39.643 --> 10:42.896
Oh. Uh, did you bite it?

10:44.648 --> 10:47.525
- Did you bite your tongue?
- I don't remember.

10:49.235 --> 10:53.573
Uh, yeah. That looks like you bit it.
You'll be fine.

10:53.657 --> 10:57.744
Well, maybe I was kissing
someone and he bit me.

10:57.827 --> 11:00.914
Oh, I think you bit it. Maybe in
your sleep. Story time, Fuzzy.

11:00.997 --> 11:05.001
O Lord, support us
all the day long...

11:05.085 --> 11:09.214
until the shadows lengthen
and the evening comes...

11:09.297 --> 11:14.010
and the busy world is hushed and
the fever of life is over...

11:14.094 --> 11:16.096
and our work is done.

11:16.179 --> 11:18.181
Then in Thy mercy,

11:18.264 --> 11:22.894
grant us a safe lodging
and a holy rest...

11:22.978 --> 11:24.938
And peace at the last.

11:25.021 --> 11:28.525
- Amen.
- Amen.

11:28.608 --> 11:30.694
"A dog, which had lain
concealed till now...

11:30.777 --> 11:33.613
"ran backwards and
forwards on the parapet...

11:33.697 --> 11:35.865
"with a dismal howl.

11:35.949 --> 11:38.118
"And collecting
himself for a spring,

11:38.201 --> 11:41.621
"jumped for the dead
man's shoulders.

11:41.705 --> 11:44.290
"Missing his aim, he
fell into a ditch...

11:44.374 --> 11:47.127
"turning completely
over as he went...

11:47.210 --> 11:49.421
"and striking his head
against the stone,

11:49.504 --> 11:52.298
dashed out his brains."

11:52.382 --> 11:54.426
And that...

11:54.509 --> 11:56.469
Is the end of the chapter.

12:02.058 --> 12:04.227
That's it till tomorrow.

12:10.442 --> 12:13.737
Good night, you
Princes of Maine,

12:13.862 --> 12:15.822
you Kings of New England.

12:19.117 --> 12:22.162
Good night, Princes of
Maine, Kings of New England.

12:22.287 --> 12:24.289
Whoa.

12:25.457 --> 12:28.752
John, you all right?

12:28.877 --> 12:32.088
Why does Dr Larch say
that every night?

12:33.798 --> 12:37.260
- Maybe to scare us.
- No, you jerk.

12:37.385 --> 12:40.055
Dr Larch loves us.

12:40.138 --> 12:42.807
But why does he do that?

12:42.932 --> 12:47.228
- Does it because we like it.
- Do you like it, Curly?

12:48.396 --> 12:50.482
Yeah.

12:50.607 --> 12:53.360
I like it too.

12:53.568 --> 12:56.404
Watch the door.

12:56.488 --> 12:59.032
You two get Copperfield and Curly.
Buster's mine.

12:59.157 --> 13:02.327
- And remember, nobody touches Fuzzy.
- Attack!

13:02.410 --> 13:05.789
Hey!

13:14.839 --> 13:17.050
- Ow!
- Ouch.

13:27.102 --> 13:29.938
What do you think you're doing?

13:30.021 --> 13:34.401
Children, stop it. No fighting.
Share the snowballs.

13:39.948 --> 13:41.908
Fuzzy. Fuzzy.

13:42.033 --> 13:44.411
Listen to you.
You've been running.

13:56.047 --> 13:58.591
Hey, over here! Look! Pick me!

14:06.641 --> 14:10.061
I know the type. They'll
take one of the babies.

14:18.194 --> 14:20.155
Mary Agnes.

14:22.699 --> 14:26.911
Come here. Don't run.

14:26.995 --> 14:29.039
Fuzzy.

14:29.164 --> 14:31.291
Curly.

14:38.006 --> 14:41.009
John.

14:43.178 --> 14:45.138
Hazel.

14:47.557 --> 14:49.684
Andy.

15:14.959 --> 15:18.129
They wanted a girl, Curly.

15:18.213 --> 15:20.674
Nobody ever wants me.

15:20.799 --> 15:24.719
Oh, hey. Hey, come on.

15:24.803 --> 15:26.846
Come here.

15:26.930 --> 15:29.849
You know, you're one
of the best, Curly.

15:29.933 --> 15:32.185
And we wouldn't let
just anyone take you.

15:32.268 --> 15:35.897
Dr Larch wouldn't let just
anyone take any of us.

15:35.981 --> 15:37.983
Well, that's true.

15:38.066 --> 15:42.153
- Nobody's asked for me, have they?
- Nobody special enough, Curly.

15:42.237 --> 15:44.531
You mean somebody has?

15:44.614 --> 15:47.575
Only the right
people can have you.

15:47.659 --> 15:50.328
Now what do you say we
go unpack your suitcase?

15:50.412 --> 15:53.581
- It's movie night tonight, Curly.
- Okay.

16:23.153 --> 16:25.613
Look. Kong thinks
she's his mother.

16:25.697 --> 16:28.283
- His mother?
- He thinks she's his mother.

16:28.366 --> 16:32.912
- He doesn't think she's his mother, Fuzzy.
- He does so. He loves her.

16:32.996 --> 16:36.124
- That's why he holds her.
- Shh, Fuzzy.

16:39.294 --> 16:43.798
Fuzzy, how can she
be his mother?

16:43.882 --> 16:46.635
He just thinks she is.

16:50.972 --> 16:53.141
They want to replace me.

16:53.224 --> 16:55.977
The board of trustees
wants to replace me.

16:56.061 --> 16:58.313
They just want you to
hire some new help.

16:58.396 --> 17:01.650
We don't need any more help.
Some new things would be useful.

17:01.733 --> 17:04.152
Yuck!

17:04.234 --> 17:07.489
Aw, come on.

17:07.571 --> 17:11.492
- Homer, I need you.
- Happens every time.

17:13.662 --> 17:15.997
Kong, Kong, Kong,
Kong, Kong, Kong!

17:16.080 --> 17:20.001
Thought you'd taken care of this.
Always breaks in the same place.

17:20.085 --> 17:24.964
- It's your splice, isn't it?
- No, it is your splice. You blame me for everything.

17:25.048 --> 17:28.927
Angela, we need a new movie, a
new projector, a new typewriter.

17:29.010 --> 17:31.012
That's what needs
replacing around here.

17:31.096 --> 17:34.307
- Wilbur, we have a delivery.
- Homer, would you get this one?

17:34.391 --> 17:37.978
She's a patient, right?
She should see a doctor.

17:38.061 --> 17:41.815
Homer, you are a skilled
and gifted surgeon...

17:41.898 --> 17:45.652
with near perfect obstetrical
and gynaecological procedure.

17:45.735 --> 17:49.656
I just mean that I'd rather
fix the movie tonight.

17:50.782 --> 17:53.326
Okay, sure.

17:53.410 --> 17:55.787
You splice, I'll deliver.

18:03.586 --> 18:07.465
Come on, Fuzz. Let's go.
Let go. Come on.

18:07.549 --> 18:10.468
Homer, doesn't King Kong think
the woman is his mother?

18:10.552 --> 18:14.681
- That's right, Fuzz. That's what Kong thinks.
- That's why Kong loves her.

18:14.764 --> 18:17.225
It's your turn. I'll get this.

18:17.309 --> 18:20.895
Okay. Story time!

18:25.317 --> 18:28.570
The Personal History
of David Copperfield.

18:28.653 --> 18:32.073
Chapter one. "I am born."

18:32.157 --> 18:36.077
"Whether I shall turn out to
be the hero of my own life...

18:36.161 --> 18:41.249
"or whether that station will be held
by anybody else, these pages must show.

18:41.333 --> 18:44.169
"I was a posthumous child.

18:44.252 --> 18:47.589
"My father's eyes had closed
upon the light of this world...

18:47.672 --> 18:51.259
Six months when
mine opened on it."

18:51.343 --> 18:54.054
His father's dead, right?

18:54.137 --> 18:56.556
That's right, Fuzz.

18:56.640 --> 18:58.683
Is your father dead?

18:58.767 --> 19:02.145
Cirrhosis. It's a
disease of the liver.

19:03.772 --> 19:05.940
What, a liver killed him?

19:06.024 --> 19:10.362
No, alcohol killed him. He
drank himself to death.

19:10.445 --> 19:13.448
- But did you know him?
- Barely.

19:13.531 --> 19:16.451
But it hardly mattered
that I knew him.

19:16.534 --> 19:19.037
- Did you know your mother better?
- Mm-hmm.

19:19.120 --> 19:23.124
She's dead now too.
She was a nanny.

19:23.208 --> 19:25.210
What's a nanny do?

19:25.293 --> 19:27.712
She looks after other
people's children.

19:29.005 --> 19:31.383
- Did she grow up around here?
- No.

19:31.466 --> 19:35.637
- She was an immigrant.
- What's an immigrant?

19:36.888 --> 19:38.890
Someone not from Maine.

19:43.144 --> 19:45.605
Let us be happy for Hazel.

19:45.689 --> 19:48.984
Hazel has found a family.
Good night, Hazel.

19:49.067 --> 19:51.569
Good night, Hazel.

20:28.940 --> 20:33.862
I was dreaming about you.
How beautiful you were.

20:33.945 --> 20:36.448
- Ah, you weren't.
- I was.

20:36.531 --> 20:39.367
- And I was beautiful?
- You were.

20:39.451 --> 20:41.870
You are.

20:41.953 --> 20:44.164
It was fantastic.

20:46.916 --> 20:49.377
It was just the ether, Wilbur.

21:02.265 --> 21:06.519
- Hi.
- Hey, Eddie, look at this.

21:06.603 --> 21:12.192
- Homer, do you ever think about trying to find your parents?
- Not really.

21:12.275 --> 21:14.235
Why not?

21:14.319 --> 21:17.739
Well, they never did the things
parents are supposed to do.

21:17.822 --> 21:22.661
Dr Larch did those things and
Nurse Edna and Nurse Angela.

21:22.744 --> 21:26.456
Well, I wish I could meet
mine anyway, sometimes.

21:27.582 --> 21:29.751
What for?

21:31.670 --> 21:36.508
Well, I'd like to show 'em
that I could cook a little.

21:36.591 --> 21:39.260
- Mm-hmm.
- And...

21:39.344 --> 21:41.429
that I could drive a truck.

21:42.639 --> 21:44.724
Mm-hmm.

21:47.018 --> 21:51.940
Sometimes I wanna meet them so I can
kill them. Just sort of kill them.

22:01.032 --> 22:03.868
You know I'd never
kill anyone, right?

22:03.952 --> 22:06.121
- Mm-hmm. I know.
- Get away!

22:06.204 --> 22:08.748
Get the hell off of me!

22:08.832 --> 22:11.292
I think Mary Agnes
could kill someone.

22:11.376 --> 22:14.546
- What the hell do you think you're doing?
- I don't think so.

22:14.629 --> 22:18.216
No, she's... she's just
an emotional girl.

22:18.299 --> 22:20.635
What's she so emotional about?

22:20.719 --> 22:24.472
She got left here like the
rest of us, didn't she?

22:32.230 --> 22:34.816
Throw it to Copperfield.

22:34.899 --> 22:36.985
I go first.

22:37.068 --> 22:39.738
I'll be on Buster's team.

22:44.200 --> 22:46.494
Look!

22:46.578 --> 22:48.663
Her temperature is 104.

22:48.747 --> 22:51.458
Scoot down.

22:51.541 --> 22:55.170
Come on. Good girl. That's a girl.
Little more.

22:55.253 --> 22:59.007
Dear child, it won't hurt when I look.
I'm just gonna look.

22:59.090 --> 23:01.635
All right.

23:10.101 --> 23:12.771
Dear child, did you, uh,
do something to yourself?

23:12.854 --> 23:15.607
It wasn't me. It wasn't me.

23:15.690 --> 23:18.193
- Did you go to someone else?
- He said he was a doctor.

23:18.276 --> 23:23.323
- I would never have stuck that inside of me. It wasn't me.
- Listen, you've been very brave.

23:23.406 --> 23:25.784
- I'm going to put you to sleep.
- It wasn't me.

23:25.867 --> 23:29.162
Homer, I want you to see this.

23:29.245 --> 23:32.290
You won't feel it any more.

23:34.417 --> 23:39.339
You've been very brave.
We'll make it deep.

23:39.422 --> 23:41.508
- You sure?
- You bet.

23:41.591 --> 23:45.971
The fetus is unexpelled.
Her uterus is punctured.

23:46.054 --> 23:51.393
She has acute peritonitis, and
there's a foreign object.

23:51.476 --> 23:53.603
I think it's a crochet hook.

23:56.815 --> 24:00.568
Take this.

24:00.652 --> 24:04.489
If she had come to you four months
ago and asked for a simple D&C,

24:04.572 --> 24:06.574
what would you have done?

24:06.658 --> 24:11.413
Nothing! This is what
doing nothing gets you.

24:11.496 --> 24:15.834
It means that somebody else is gonna do
the job, some moron who doesn't know how.

24:19.671 --> 24:22.257
I wish you'd have come
to me, dear child.

24:35.979 --> 24:38.106
What did she die of?

24:38.231 --> 24:40.358
She died of secrecy.

24:40.483 --> 24:45.238
- She died of ignorance.
- Oh.

24:45.363 --> 24:49.075
Homer, if you expect people to be
responsible for their children,

24:49.200 --> 24:53.747
you have to give them the right to
decide whether or not to have children.

24:53.872 --> 24:57.125
- Wouldn't you agree?
- How about expecting people to be responsible enough...

24:57.250 --> 24:59.294
to control themselves
to begin with?

24:59.419 --> 25:02.797
How about this child? You
expect her to be responsible?

25:02.922 --> 25:05.800
I'm not talking about her.

25:05.925 --> 25:08.970
I'm talking about adults.

25:09.095 --> 25:11.264
You know who I mean.

25:16.061 --> 25:19.272
- What?
- It's just... It's just a marvel to me...

25:19.397 --> 25:23.610
that you still have such
high expectations of people.

25:23.735 --> 25:27.489
- I'm happy I amuse you.
- Look at it this way.

25:27.614 --> 25:31.451
What choice does Buster have?
What are his options?

25:31.576 --> 25:34.746
- Nobody will ever adopt him.
- Look at it this way.

25:34.871 --> 25:39.668
Buster and I are sitting here right beside you.
We could have ended up in the incinerator.

25:39.793 --> 25:44.673
Happy to be alive under any circumstances.
Is that your point?

25:52.806 --> 25:55.350
Happy to be alive?
Yeah, I guess so.

26:10.907 --> 26:15.704
- You're it.
- Pass it over here.

26:15.787 --> 26:20.250
- So many children. Are they all orphans?
- Well, it is an orphanage.

26:22.168 --> 26:24.379
- Who wants chocolate?
- I want some chocolate.

26:24.504 --> 26:26.881
Hi. Okay.

26:27.007 --> 26:30.510
They're getting in the car.
Watch your fingers.

26:30.593 --> 26:32.721
Hi.

26:32.846 --> 26:35.056
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:35.181 --> 26:38.101
- I'm the best.
- You are?

26:38.184 --> 26:40.937
Wow! The best? The best at what?

26:41.021 --> 26:44.941
- I'm the best one.
- The best one, huh?

26:45.025 --> 26:47.402
- I'm the best one of all the kids.
- You are?

26:47.527 --> 26:49.571
He seems like the best one.

26:56.328 --> 27:00.248
Well, let's see if we can take
care of that. Can you blow?

27:00.373 --> 27:02.917
I really am the best.
I just have a cold.

27:03.043 --> 27:06.629
Sorry. They're not used to
seeing a car like this.

27:06.713 --> 27:07.964
Ah, it's okay. I don't mind.

27:08.048 --> 27:10.091
Come on.

27:10.175 --> 27:12.719
Come on. Let's get out.
Come on now.

27:12.802 --> 27:15.263
- Oh, sure you can. Come on.
- Good morning.

27:17.223 --> 27:19.267
- Morning.
- Dr Larch.

27:19.351 --> 27:23.104
- Candy.
- Hi, I'm Wally. I brought some chocolates for the kids.

27:23.229 --> 27:26.900
Chocolates? How thoughtful.
Come on, Curly.

27:30.904 --> 27:33.990
- So, Mrs...
- Candy.

27:34.074 --> 27:36.201
Candy Kendall.

27:36.326 --> 27:38.953
Wally. Wally Worthington.

27:49.923 --> 27:52.258
How many months are you?

27:57.764 --> 28:01.977
- Uh, two.
- Two.

28:05.438 --> 28:07.983
Um...

28:08.108 --> 28:11.861
Are you... Are you the...
Are you doing the...

28:11.945 --> 28:14.948
Oh, no. Dr Larch will be
performing the procedure.

28:15.031 --> 28:17.492
- Oh, good.
- Okay.

28:17.575 --> 28:20.704
I was... I was just curious.

28:20.787 --> 28:23.373
Excuse me.

28:23.456 --> 28:26.334
The woman you delivered last
night, she's complaining of pain.

28:26.418 --> 28:29.879
Okay. I'll take a look.
Couple of minutes. Thank you.

28:41.641 --> 28:43.643
Are you okay?

28:43.727 --> 28:47.480
Yeah. I think it was the ether.

28:47.564 --> 28:51.234
Oh, the... That smell
must've got to me.

28:52.986 --> 28:56.573
Oh, God, this is all my fault.

28:56.656 --> 29:00.160
Homer, Steerforth got into the pantry.
He's eaten all the pie dough.

29:00.243 --> 29:03.663
- He wasn't sharing it either.
- He's down the hall throwing up.

29:03.747 --> 29:07.250
- He's such a pig.
- Don't call him a pig. It's not nice to call people names.

29:07.334 --> 29:09.794
But he is a pig.

29:12.839 --> 29:15.508
What kind of planes
do you fly in?

29:15.592 --> 29:17.594
AB-24 Liberator.

29:17.677 --> 29:21.723
Oh. Liberator.

29:21.806 --> 29:25.018
You enlisted?

29:25.101 --> 29:28.605
They wouldn't take me. I'm Class 4.
I have a heart defect.

29:28.688 --> 29:31.232
- Yeah? Is it serious?
- No.

29:31.316 --> 29:35.278
No, it's not serious. I'm just
not supposed to get excited.

29:35.362 --> 29:38.448
You know, no strain, no stress. I
try to keep calm all the time.

29:38.531 --> 29:42.285
I can't imagine there's any
strain or stress around here.

29:42.369 --> 29:45.205
Yeah.

29:50.460 --> 29:53.129
- How she's doing?
- Just fine.

29:53.213 --> 29:55.548
Good.

29:57.300 --> 29:59.469
Boy or a girl?

29:59.552 --> 30:02.263
- It's all over, dear.
- Yeah, it's all over, honey.

30:07.727 --> 30:12.148
I would really like to
have a baby one day.

30:12.232 --> 30:14.275
- I really would.
- Why, of course.

30:14.359 --> 30:17.112
You can have as many
children as you want.

30:17.195 --> 30:22.367
- I'm sure you'll have very beautiful children.
- Oh, yes, I'm sure. I'm sure.

30:24.744 --> 30:29.124
You'll have Princes of Maine.
You'll have Kings of New England.

30:31.501 --> 30:35.005
Lieutenant, I think you should
find yourself some fresh air.

30:47.559 --> 30:50.645
- I still don't feel so good.
- Cut it out, children.

30:50.729 --> 30:53.523
Homer, what's a runt?
Copperfield called me a runt.

30:53.606 --> 30:55.859
He was just kidding, Fuzz.

30:55.942 --> 30:58.653
- Here.
- Orange is my favourite colour.

30:58.737 --> 31:01.656
Should I keep the teeth orange?

31:01.740 --> 31:03.658
Homer, look.

31:03.742 --> 31:06.578
Homer, look, look.

31:07.871 --> 31:10.665
Homer, when is Halloween?

31:10.749 --> 31:13.460
- It's at the end of October.
- Is that soon?

31:13.543 --> 31:16.713
That's a few months away, Fuzz.

31:16.796 --> 31:21.217
Oh, it's the best time. Homer?

31:21.301 --> 31:25.055
- What is Honolulu?
- Honolulu?

31:25.138 --> 31:27.724
Hmm. It's a city.

31:27.807 --> 31:31.186
Oh. What's the moonlight like?

31:33.104 --> 31:35.315
Well, I've never been there,

31:35.398 --> 31:39.653
- but I think that it would probably be very bright.
- Oh.

31:39.736 --> 31:42.238
Why do we get pumpkins
only once a year?

31:45.158 --> 31:47.744
Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.

31:54.834 --> 31:58.672
Eeew, that's disgusting!
He does this all the time.

31:58.755 --> 32:00.924
Stop it right now.

32:30.954 --> 32:34.457
- Hey.
- Hey. How's she doin'?

32:34.541 --> 32:37.085
- Oh, she's fine.
- Good.

32:39.129 --> 32:41.131
Fine.

32:44.551 --> 32:49.055
I... I was wondering if
you could give me a ride?

32:49.139 --> 32:51.308
Sure.

32:51.391 --> 32:55.145
I'd be glad to.
Uh, a ride where?

32:55.228 --> 32:56.980
Where you goin'?

32:57.063 --> 32:59.649
We're headin' back
to Cape Kenneth.

32:59.733 --> 33:03.903
Cape Kenneth? That sounds fine.

33:05.238 --> 33:07.449
Okay.

33:19.377 --> 33:22.464
Doubtless you will let me know
what immensely worthwhile...

33:22.547 --> 33:26.176
or at least useful thing
that it is you find to do.

33:26.259 --> 33:29.012
I wasn't intending to leave
here to be entirely useless.

33:29.095 --> 33:32.932
I expect I'll find some
other way to be of use.

33:33.016 --> 33:37.187
- In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
- Of course.

33:37.270 --> 33:41.524
Are you so stupid you imagine you're
going to find a more gratifying life?

33:41.608 --> 33:44.527
What you will find is people like
the poor people who get left here.

33:44.611 --> 33:49.366
Only nobody takes care of them half as well.
You won't be able to take care of them either.

33:49.449 --> 33:54.371
There's no taking care of
anybody, not out there.

33:54.454 --> 33:58.291
You know I'm grateful for
everything that you've done for me.

33:58.375 --> 34:02.879
- I don't need your gratitude.
- I don't need this. I know all about my condition.

34:02.962 --> 34:06.883
It's your heart. You ought
to take it with you.

34:16.601 --> 34:19.896
Going where? Does he have
a plan of some kind?

34:19.980 --> 34:23.692
- Will he be back soon?
- I don't know. He's just leaving.

34:23.775 --> 34:26.735
You were the one who says
he needs to see the world.

34:26.820 --> 34:30.239
- That's what he'll do, is see the world.
- He's leaving.

34:30.322 --> 34:35.078
- He'll need clothes. He'll need some money.
- Let him try to make some money.

34:35.161 --> 34:37.539
That's part of seeing
the world, isn't it?

34:37.621 --> 34:41.126
Oh, Wilbur, stop it. You knew this was
going to happen. He's a young man.

34:43.253 --> 34:45.588
He's still a boy.

34:45.672 --> 34:49.259
Out in the world,

34:49.342 --> 34:51.761
he's still a boy.

34:51.844 --> 34:55.931
Just find him some
clothes, Wilbur.

34:56.016 --> 34:58.643
He could use some clothes.

35:24.878 --> 35:27.964
Homer.

35:28.048 --> 35:31.551
Copperfield. It'll be all right.

35:31.635 --> 35:36.640
Children, up on the porch.
Up, up.

35:36.723 --> 35:39.976
Say goodbye. Wave from here.

35:44.981 --> 35:47.067
- Bye. Bye.
- Bye, Homer.

35:55.241 --> 35:57.619
Bye, Homer.

35:59.412 --> 36:01.456
Come on.

36:20.100 --> 36:23.436
- I can walk. Put me down.
- Nope. I wanna carry you.

36:23.520 --> 36:27.649
- No, it's okay.
- Here, let me get this.

36:27.732 --> 36:30.694
Wally, put me down.

36:30.777 --> 36:33.279
Okay. Okay.

36:34.572 --> 36:37.117
Hey.

36:37.200 --> 36:40.870
Coming with us? That's good.

36:40.954 --> 36:43.498
You never know when you're
gonna need a doctor.

36:43.581 --> 36:46.167
- Do you want me to put the top up?
- No.

36:46.251 --> 36:49.295
- You might get cold.
- I want some fresh air.

36:57.053 --> 36:59.347
She'll be just fine.

37:03.685 --> 37:06.396
Is he gonna come out?

37:15.488 --> 37:19.242
- Bye, Homer.
- Bye, Curly.

37:19.367 --> 37:22.245
Sorry I have to go.

37:22.329 --> 37:26.041
It's not fair. You're too old.

37:33.506 --> 37:37.969
I couldn't find Buster. Maybe
you could tell him that l...

37:49.856 --> 37:53.276
- Bye, Homer!
- Don't go too far!

37:53.401 --> 37:55.695
Homer, bye!

37:57.322 --> 37:59.407
Hey, Homer!

38:33.274 --> 38:35.568
Let us be happy for Homer Wells.

38:35.694 --> 38:38.613
Homer has found a family.

38:38.738 --> 38:41.199
Aren't we all happy for Homer?

38:41.282 --> 38:45.328
- Yes.
- Good night, Homer.

38:45.412 --> 38:47.706
Good night, Homer.

38:51.710 --> 38:53.670
Good night, Homer.

39:45.180 --> 39:49.225
Actually, the army's
given me leave twice.

39:49.309 --> 39:52.687
First, when my father died. And now I'm
on leave to help my mom with the harvest.

39:52.771 --> 39:55.065
She's no farmer. Apples
were my dad's business,

39:55.190 --> 39:58.109
but with the war on
she's short of pickers.

39:58.193 --> 40:01.863
- Wally thinks apples are boring.
- I never said they were boring.

40:01.988 --> 40:05.575
Yes, you did. You said apples
weren't exactly flying.

40:05.700 --> 40:09.621
- They aren't.
- I think I would like the apple business.

40:09.704 --> 40:12.457
- You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
- No.

40:12.540 --> 40:16.795
- No, not really. I need a job.
- Where are you headed?

40:16.878 --> 40:19.631
- I don't know.
- What are you gonna do?

40:19.714 --> 40:21.966
I don't know.

40:22.050 --> 40:26.137
Is your family in the apple
business too, Candy?

40:26.221 --> 40:29.099
No. But I work there. I like it.

40:29.182 --> 40:31.309
My dad's a lobster man.

40:31.393 --> 40:33.937
- Oh, wow.
- Mm-hmm.

40:35.855 --> 40:38.984
I've never actually
seen a lobster.

40:39.985 --> 40:42.612
Are you serious?

40:42.696 --> 40:44.823
I've never seen
the ocean either.

40:44.906 --> 40:48.118
You... You've never
seen the ocean?

40:48.201 --> 40:50.829
That's not funny.
That's serious.

41:44.257 --> 41:46.468
It's beautiful.

41:48.637 --> 41:50.680
Yeah.

41:54.142 --> 41:56.311
Do you have cramps?

41:59.481 --> 42:01.983
They'll ease up soon.

42:02.067 --> 42:05.403
As long as the bleeding
isn't heavy, it's normal,

42:05.487 --> 42:07.906
it should taper off tomorrow.

42:07.989 --> 42:10.617
Catch!

42:12.327 --> 42:14.329
All right.

42:14.412 --> 42:16.414
- Throw it back.
- Okay.

42:16.498 --> 42:18.750
All right!

42:18.833 --> 42:22.754
Put your fingers on the laces.

42:22.837 --> 42:25.090
Here's China. Here's India.

42:25.173 --> 42:29.177
- Mm-hmm.
- Seven-hour round trip flight. It's called the "Burma run."

42:29.260 --> 42:32.764
And this part's called "Flying over
the hump." These are the Himalayas.

42:32.847 --> 42:35.266
How high do you fly there?

42:35.350 --> 42:39.562
Well, I have to fly 15,000 feet
within the first 35 minutes.

42:39.646 --> 42:42.232
Otherwise we won't make it
over the first mountain.

42:42.315 --> 42:45.235
- They got the worst air currents in the world.
- Dangerous, huh?

42:45.318 --> 42:49.447
Yeah. Actually, I volunteered.

42:49.531 --> 42:52.575
Did you really?

42:55.787 --> 42:59.624
Hey, look. If you're serious about wanting
a job, picking apples isn't that boring.

42:59.708 --> 43:03.420
Yeah? Oh, I would
love that, Wally.

43:08.717 --> 43:11.636
- See you around, Homer.
- Oh, yeah.

43:14.389 --> 43:17.892
- Thank you, for everything.
- Mm-hmm.

43:24.316 --> 43:26.318
Hi, Sam.

43:29.487 --> 43:31.489
Hi, Dad!

43:56.181 --> 43:58.433
Come on. You're
gonna meet my mom.

44:02.270 --> 44:06.274
By the way, I've been at
a wedding, all right?

44:06.358 --> 44:09.527
If it comes up, that's where
I met you, at the wedding.

44:18.036 --> 44:20.330
Wally? Wally, is that you?

44:20.413 --> 44:24.668
Mom, this is Homer Wells.

44:24.751 --> 44:27.379
- How do you do, Homer?
- Oh, good. How do you do?

44:27.462 --> 44:31.549
He's the most overqualified apple picker
you'll ever meet, but he's dying to learn.

44:31.633 --> 44:34.469
Really? Were you a friend
of the groom's, Homer?

44:34.552 --> 44:37.722
Homer's a friend of the groom's,
the bride's, everyone. Come on.

44:37.806 --> 44:41.851
In that case, maybe you'd like
to stay to dinner, Homer?

44:41.935 --> 44:45.230
- Another time, Mom.
- You gotta meet Mr Rose.

44:45.313 --> 44:47.732
You used up all the hot water!

44:47.816 --> 44:50.068
- You're usin' my soap, ain't you?
- I ain't usin' no soap.

45:01.621 --> 45:03.665
They're migrants.

45:03.748 --> 45:07.836
They pick the fruit. All kinds.

45:07.919 --> 45:10.922
They travel up and down the
coast with the seasons.

45:11.006 --> 45:14.175
The trick to Mr Rose is you
have to let him be boss.

45:14.259 --> 45:16.386
Oh, excuse me.

45:16.469 --> 45:19.597
- The sink's backed up again, Wally.
- Not again.

45:19.681 --> 45:22.726
- Thought you said you was gonna get us a plumber.
- Rose, this is Homer.

45:22.809 --> 45:26.604
- Homer, this is Mr Rose's daughter, Rose.
- You a plumber?

45:26.688 --> 45:30.025
Homer's the new picker. He's
gonna stay here with you.

45:32.319 --> 45:36.072
- He's stayin' here?
- Yeah.

45:36.156 --> 45:38.241
Uh-oh.

45:38.325 --> 45:42.579
This daughter of mine, she's just
Miss Hospitality, ain't she, Wally?

45:47.542 --> 45:51.254
New picker? You got lots
of experience, I expect.

45:51.338 --> 45:53.298
Homer's got no
experience, Arthur,

45:53.381 --> 45:56.092
but he's smarter than I am
and he's a fast learner.

45:56.176 --> 45:58.762
Mr Rose is gonna teach
you the apple business.

45:58.845 --> 46:02.140
Well, I believe this is history.

46:02.223 --> 46:05.143
We're makin' history,
Wally, ain't we?

46:05.226 --> 46:08.104
We're makin' history havin'
this young man stay with us.

46:10.565 --> 46:14.277
Why don't you show him around?

46:22.243 --> 46:24.788
Your name is Rose Rose?

46:24.871 --> 46:26.956
- Pretty, ain't it?
- Very.

46:27.040 --> 46:31.753
- You like to read?
- I really can't read that good.

46:38.885 --> 46:43.932
Homer, what does this say? Here.

46:49.854 --> 46:52.649
"I looked at the stars
and considered...

46:52.732 --> 46:56.152
"how awful it would be for a man
to turn his face to them...

46:56.236 --> 47:00.115
"and he froze to death and
see no help or pity...

47:00.198 --> 47:02.617
in all the glittering
multitude."

47:02.701 --> 47:05.286
More.

47:05.370 --> 47:07.872
Since you the one...

47:07.956 --> 47:10.208
who's smart enough to read,

47:10.291 --> 47:12.377
what's this here?

47:22.137 --> 47:25.807
- It's a list of rules it seems.
- Whose rules?

47:25.890 --> 47:28.059
I imagine they're
for us, I suppose.

47:28.143 --> 47:31.146
Go on then. Read 'em, Homer.

47:32.480 --> 47:34.941
"One: Please don't
smoke in bed."

47:38.987 --> 47:42.073
It's too late for that one.
Keep reading, Homer.

47:42.157 --> 47:46.202
"Two: Please don't operate the grinder
or press if you've been drinking."

47:46.286 --> 47:49.080
You know, they ain't
our rules, Homer.

47:49.164 --> 47:52.542
We didn't write 'em. I don't
see no need to read 'em.

47:53.668 --> 47:55.628
Okay.

48:04.262 --> 48:07.557
Good night, you
Princes of Maine,

48:07.641 --> 48:09.809
you Kings of New England.

48:34.709 --> 48:37.128
Hoo! Remember this.

48:37.212 --> 48:41.800
In the morning when the grass
is wet, you can make it slide.

48:43.969 --> 48:46.763
- Feel it?
- Yeah.

48:46.846 --> 48:50.266
It's almost like flying.

48:50.350 --> 48:53.478
Watch out for the trees.

48:53.561 --> 48:55.814
Trees are flak,
antiaircraft fire...

48:55.897 --> 48:58.650
from the geeks on the ground.

49:09.995 --> 49:12.622
- Hey, Homer.
- Hi.

49:12.706 --> 49:15.500
I was just showin'
Homer the orchard.

49:15.583 --> 49:18.086
- Kind of a geography lesson.
- Really?

49:18.169 --> 49:20.922
- Yeah.
- What's that?

49:21.006 --> 49:25.468
- What?
- This, here. Looks like you've been giving him flying lessons.

49:25.552 --> 49:28.138
Ah, he loved it. Didn't you?

49:30.265 --> 49:32.684
Wally here thinks people like
being whacked by branches.

49:32.767 --> 49:36.813
- Oh, I liked it.
- Really?

49:36.938 --> 49:39.607
Yeah!

49:41.318 --> 49:43.862
- You're unbelievable.
- Well, thank you very much.

50:05.342 --> 50:07.886
Hey! What's wrong with you?

50:08.011 --> 50:11.890
Sorry.

50:12.015 --> 50:16.227
That's Vernon. You better stay away from
him till he gets to know you better.

50:16.353 --> 50:20.023
- Then you best stay away from him even more.
- - Homer.

50:21.858 --> 50:24.527
Lieutenant's calling you. You
better watch your ass, Homer.

50:24.653 --> 50:26.571
Hey, Wally.

50:26.696 --> 50:28.698
- You gettin' along okay?
- Yeah.

50:33.328 --> 50:35.747
- Guess what.
- What?

50:35.872 --> 50:38.541
I'm shippin' out today.

50:38.667 --> 50:40.877
It's a little sooner
than I expected, but...

50:41.002 --> 50:46.424
I wanted to make sure that you're
settled and happy enough considering...

50:46.508 --> 50:49.177
Are you bored stiff or do you
think you can stick it out a bit?

50:49.302 --> 50:52.472
Yeah, of course. I'm
grateful for the job, Wally.

50:52.555 --> 50:55.725
I'm grateful too. It gives me peace of mind
knowin' you're here keepin' an eye on things.

50:55.809 --> 50:58.228
- Well, that's good.
- You about ready, Homer?

50:58.353 --> 51:00.563
Yeah.

51:00.647 --> 51:04.859
- Uh, look, Wally, thanks. I'm lucky I met you.
- I'm the lucky one.

51:04.985 --> 51:07.320
- No, really, I'm lucky.
- Do you wanna fight about it?

51:08.738 --> 51:11.908
- Kidding.
- Oh, okay.

51:11.992 --> 51:14.119
- Take care of yourself.
- Okay.

51:14.202 --> 51:16.162
Bye.

51:17.330 --> 51:19.541
Okay, Mr Rose.

51:47.402 --> 51:50.488
Turn. That's right.
Turn and pull.

51:50.572 --> 51:54.159
Turn and pull. Just like that.
Good. Good.

51:54.242 --> 51:57.495
Okay, that's good. Right now you're
pickin' mostly cider apples.

51:57.620 --> 52:00.540
All these drops here,
they good only for cider.

52:00.623 --> 52:03.460
And you're picking apples with
the stem only half the time.

52:03.543 --> 52:06.463
Golden rule, Homer. You wanna
pick the apple with the stem.

52:06.546 --> 52:10.634
Now, see that there? The
spur right above the stem?

52:10.717 --> 52:13.887
That's the bud for next year's apple.
That's called the "spur."

52:13.970 --> 52:16.264
Pick the spur, you're
pickin' two years in one.

52:16.389 --> 52:20.310
You're pickin' next year's apple before it have
a chance to grow. So you wanna leave that.

52:20.393 --> 52:23.063
- Okay.
- All right, let me see you work.

52:24.814 --> 52:27.692
Yeah. That's good.

52:29.653 --> 52:31.738
Yeah, that's much better.
That's better.

52:31.821 --> 52:34.199
I can see you got
yourself some education.

52:34.324 --> 52:37.243
Them good hands you got.

52:37.327 --> 52:40.705
Them hands you got, they know what
they're doin'. Ain't that right?

52:40.789 --> 52:44.542
- I guess so.
- All right.

52:44.626 --> 52:48.254
- You keep on workin', Homer. I'll be right back.
- Okay.

52:48.338 --> 52:50.799
Wilbur? Wilbur?

52:52.509 --> 52:55.887
Wilbur? You should read this.

52:55.971 --> 52:58.098
It's from the board.
Another letter.

52:58.181 --> 53:03.103
"Merely suggesting that some new
blood might benefit you all.

53:03.186 --> 53:06.690
Someone with new ideas in the
obstetrical and paediatric fields."

53:06.773 --> 53:10.610
I think they're just testing
some ideas for our next meeting.

53:10.694 --> 53:14.781
Dr Holtz seems nice. I think
he only wants to help.

53:14.864 --> 53:19.452
He's a goddam psychiatrist!
Of course he wants to help.

53:19.536 --> 53:21.746
He'd be happy to
help to commit me.

53:21.830 --> 53:24.416
It's this Mrs Goodhall you
have to be careful of, Wilbur.

53:24.499 --> 53:27.293
We have to be more than
careful of Mrs Goodhall.

53:27.377 --> 53:31.047
She has enough Christian zeal
to start her own country.

53:32.632 --> 53:35.552
I'd like to give her
a little ether.

53:35.635 --> 53:38.221
- So, what are you going to do?
- Take this.

53:41.391 --> 53:46.479
Homer Wells, born Portland,
Maine, March 2, 1915.

53:46.563 --> 53:48.773
But Homer was born here.

53:48.857 --> 53:51.735
- In what was it? 1922?
- Mm-hmm.

53:51.818 --> 53:55.447
Graduated Bowdoin College, 1935.

53:55.530 --> 53:58.116
Harvard School of
Medicine, 1939.

53:58.199 --> 54:01.328
- That's you, Wilbur. You went there.
- An internship,

54:01.411 --> 54:06.499
and two years of training at the
Boston Lying-In, South End Branch,

54:06.583 --> 54:09.336
he was judged an accomplished
gynaecological...

54:09.419 --> 54:12.088
- and obstetrical surgeon...
- That's not him.

54:12.172 --> 54:14.674
With experience in
paediatric care.

54:14.758 --> 54:16.926
Wilbur, you're making this up.

54:17.010 --> 54:21.348
Angela, the board is
going to replace me.

54:21.431 --> 54:24.434
That is what the
new blood is for.

54:24.517 --> 54:28.521
You mean they're going to replace you with
someone who doesn't perform abortions.

54:28.605 --> 54:31.858
Well, we can only guess at that.
They are against the law.

54:31.941 --> 54:34.486
These credentials are
against the law.

54:34.569 --> 54:39.199
We all know I trained Homer, so his
credentials are as good as mine.

54:39.282 --> 54:42.202
And don't be holy to
me about the law.

54:42.285 --> 54:44.579
What has the law ever
done for anyone here?

54:46.122 --> 54:49.793
So, what do you think
about my candidate?

54:49.876 --> 54:54.255
What about school records? Homer
doesn't have any diplomas.

54:55.548 --> 54:58.843
Come here, Edna, please.
Come here.

55:05.767 --> 55:08.144
He will have them.

55:08.228 --> 55:10.855
Wilbur!

55:10.939 --> 55:13.108
I don't know...

55:16.653 --> 55:18.822
All of these on there, okay.

55:18.905 --> 55:21.032
- Gotta pack 'em tight now, y'all.
- I got it.

55:21.116 --> 55:23.076
What do you think we do?

55:23.159 --> 55:26.579
- All aboard, Mrs Worthington.
- Thank you, Arthur.

55:26.663 --> 55:29.582
How's this crew this year?
Got any rotten apples?

55:29.666 --> 55:31.710
- It's a good crew, ma'am.
- Hey, Rose Rose.

55:31.793 --> 55:34.254
- You tryin' to break my finger? Damn!
- Just an accident.

55:34.337 --> 55:37.173
Excuse me.

55:37.257 --> 55:42.220
Well, maybe we got one bad apple,
but it's nothing we can't handle.

55:42.304 --> 55:44.097
I see.

55:44.180 --> 55:46.766
How's young Homer working out?

55:46.850 --> 55:48.852
- Good. He's a smart young man.
- Hey, Homer.

55:48.935 --> 55:51.730
- Wally was right about him. Real hard worker.
- Good.

55:51.813 --> 55:54.190
Mornin', Miss Worthington.

55:54.274 --> 55:58.445
Why don't you come up and visit me at the house?
I know I've got clothes that will fit you.

55:58.528 --> 56:01.239
- Okay.
- I'm sure I can find a ton of things to fit you.

56:01.323 --> 56:05.285
Rose don't really need any
more pickin' clothes, ma'am.

56:05.368 --> 56:08.538
- Uh-huh.
- Now don't be a party-pooper, Arthur.

56:08.621 --> 56:11.791
I have a beautiful blouse...

56:11.875 --> 56:14.461
- Hey, Rose Rose.
- Homer.

56:14.544 --> 56:16.629
- Hey.
- Hi.

56:16.713 --> 56:19.632
How you feelin'?

56:19.716 --> 56:22.636
When I'm not thinking
of Wally, I'm fine.

56:22.719 --> 56:26.097
I'm not really good
at being alone.

56:28.642 --> 56:31.811
Oh.

56:31.895 --> 56:34.606
Feeling much better. Thanks.

56:36.816 --> 56:38.943
Hey, listen.

56:39.027 --> 56:43.865
Maybe if you're free, you'd like to
come and have dinner at my dad's place?

56:46.201 --> 56:50.455
- Okay.
- You haven't seen a lobster yet, have you?

56:50.538 --> 56:53.291
- No.
- Oh, good.

57:08.765 --> 57:10.767
You're hungry, right?

57:27.283 --> 57:30.662
- What is that?
- - It's a drive-in movie theatre.

57:30.745 --> 57:32.706
- It's a movie outside?
- Yeah.

57:32.789 --> 57:34.791
- Oh, can we see it?
- Okay.

57:43.133 --> 57:46.720
- It's closed now because of the blackouts.
- Oh.

57:47.929 --> 57:50.890
It's so big.

57:50.974 --> 57:53.393
You smoke? You want a cigarette?

57:53.476 --> 57:56.062
Okay.

57:59.607 --> 58:03.820
Wally would kill me if
he saw me doin' this.

58:11.244 --> 58:14.039
- There you go.
- Thanks.

58:16.583 --> 58:18.585
So, you like movies?

58:18.668 --> 58:21.171
Yes. Seen only one, though.

58:24.007 --> 58:27.052
You've seen only one? Which one?

58:27.135 --> 58:30.847
Uh, King Kong. It's really good.

58:47.614 --> 58:49.616
Mmm. Oh.

58:49.699 --> 58:53.620
Wilbur, it's a pie apple. Here, look.
See? Try one of those.

58:53.703 --> 58:56.998
So he's an apple
expert now, is he?

58:59.876 --> 59:03.630
Oh, my, yes. That's a
far superior taste.

59:03.713 --> 59:05.715
And crisp too.

59:05.799 --> 59:08.301
So many apples are
disappointingly mealy.

59:08.385 --> 59:11.054
Wilbur, he picked
these for us himself.

59:11.137 --> 59:17.060
You don't find it depressing that
Homer Wells is picking apples?

59:17.143 --> 59:19.312
Or that he can't be bothered
to write us a proper letter?

59:19.396 --> 59:22.273
Wilbur, it's a gift.

59:22.357 --> 59:25.318
I'll show him a gift.

59:25.402 --> 59:27.988
I'll send him a gift he can use.

59:31.574 --> 59:34.744
There goes Jimmy Stewart
on his way to enlist.

59:34.828 --> 59:37.414
One of the most popular
stars on the screen.

59:37.497 --> 59:40.250
Today he's Lieutenant
Stewart, U.S.A.

59:47.257 --> 59:50.844
Crossing the equator, there's a lighter
side, as novices are introduced...

59:50.927 --> 59:54.014
to the traditional
realm of King Neptune.

59:54.097 --> 59:58.935
Boxing matches, helping relieve the
monotony of long, weary days at sea.

01:00:20.623 --> 01:00:22.876
Well, it looked
like you liked it.

01:00:22.959 --> 01:00:26.046
I did like it. All I said
was, it's no King Kong.

01:00:26.129 --> 01:00:30.842
I mean, first she loved him, then she
didn't. Then no one else could have him.

01:00:30.925 --> 01:00:34.596
No, but she did love him. How
many women have you known?

01:00:36.306 --> 01:00:40.143
And what did she die of exactly?

01:00:40.226 --> 01:00:44.731
She was torn apart. She
died of a broken heart.

01:00:44.814 --> 01:00:48.068
Oh. Well, I just...

01:00:48.151 --> 01:00:50.945
I need a better
medical explanation.

01:00:52.947 --> 01:00:57.619
Torn apart. At least King
Kong, he knew what he wanted.

01:01:00.664 --> 01:01:03.667
Hey, what you doin'
with that Candy, Homer?

01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:07.754
Makin' history, I suppose.

01:01:07.837 --> 01:01:11.925
- You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope.
- No trouble.

01:01:12.008 --> 01:01:16.513
That Candy, she's the
nicest girl I know.

01:01:16.596 --> 01:01:21.267
She's about the most beautiful girl I've ever
seen, but I don't know if she's the nicest.

01:01:21.351 --> 01:01:25.063
She's the nicest and most
beautiful girl I've ever known.

01:01:25.146 --> 01:01:27.774
See, that sounds like you
in trouble already, Homer.

01:01:27.857 --> 01:01:29.943
Sounds like big
trouble to me, Homer.

01:01:32.696 --> 01:01:35.740
- I'm not in trouble.
- Yeah, you is.

01:01:35.824 --> 01:01:38.368
I know when people
are in trouble.

01:01:38.451 --> 01:01:40.453
You is.

01:01:40.578 --> 01:01:42.455
His name is Homer Wells,

01:01:42.539 --> 01:01:46.376
and his pathetic resume
is the best I've seen.

01:01:46.459 --> 01:01:50.296
I find it hard to believe that the board
would be interested in this character.

01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:52.716
But he looks like an
excellent young man.

01:01:52.799 --> 01:01:55.302
A first-rate candidate.
Don't you think?

01:01:55.385 --> 01:01:58.305
He looks like a bleeding heart
missionary moron to me.

01:01:58.388 --> 01:02:01.641
But that would be the problem with any
doctor interested in coming here.

01:02:01.725 --> 01:02:04.311
- Do you know him?
- No, and I don't want to.

01:02:04.394 --> 01:02:06.604
He's doing missionary
work in India.

01:02:06.730 --> 01:02:11.943
I wrote to him weeks ago, but either
he's too holy or too busy to answer.

01:02:12.068 --> 01:02:14.988
Tomboy!

01:02:16.865 --> 01:02:20.368
Sorry. Okay. Come on.

01:02:21.911 --> 01:02:24.748
I fail to see how someone
courageous enough...

01:02:24.873 --> 01:02:28.585
to make a commitment to a foreign mission
is automatically to be dismissed.

01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:33.298
That part of the world requires precisely
the kind of dedication that is needed here.

01:02:33.506 --> 01:02:35.717
Does it snow in Bombay?

01:02:35.842 --> 01:02:39.262
One winter here and we'll be
shipping him south in a coffin!

01:02:39.387 --> 01:02:41.681
But Dr Larch, he seems
exceptionally qualified.

01:02:41.806 --> 01:02:44.392
I'm not talking about his
medical qualifications.

01:02:44.517 --> 01:02:49.606
It's the Christian thing that bothers me. I just
don't see it as being much use around here.

01:02:49.731 --> 01:02:53.693
I fail to see how a little
Christianity could hurt anyone here.

01:02:55.403 --> 01:02:58.948
Anyway, I was just showing you
this guy as an example...

01:02:59.074 --> 01:03:01.034
of what's available.

01:03:01.159 --> 01:03:05.372
- I didn't think you'd be interested.
- We're very interested.

01:03:05.497 --> 01:03:09.793
- Oh, yes, very.
- You wouldn't be opposed to meeting with him?

01:03:11.086 --> 01:03:14.464
Well, it wouldn't
hurt to meet him.

01:03:14.589 --> 01:03:18.134
- What's his name again?
- Dr Homer Wells.

01:03:18.259 --> 01:03:21.888
- It's a nice name. Very New England.
- Very Maine.

01:03:22.013 --> 01:03:24.140
A very local sounding name.

01:03:24.224 --> 01:03:26.184
Very.

01:03:30.605 --> 01:03:33.525
I told you. If I
appear to want it,

01:03:33.608 --> 01:03:35.652
they don't want it.

01:03:35.735 --> 01:03:38.989
If I appear to hate it,
they just gotta have it.

01:03:41.241 --> 01:03:44.411
- Excuse me. I just wanna ask you something.
- Edna, come dance with me.

01:03:44.536 --> 01:03:47.080
Let's be foolish tonight.
Come on.

01:03:47.205 --> 01:03:51.751
Does he know he's supposed to be in India?
Does he even want to come back?

01:03:51.876 --> 01:03:54.254
He's a field hand!

01:03:55.630 --> 01:03:58.133
What could possibly
hold him there?

01:04:01.636 --> 01:04:04.389
Homer! It's time to go!

01:04:04.472 --> 01:04:08.393
- Oh, I gotta go.
- Okay.

01:04:08.476 --> 01:04:14.149
Right now, we're usin' them
early Macs and Gravensteins.

01:04:14.232 --> 01:04:18.069
Cider is way too watery, man. We
ain't gonna get no good cider...

01:04:18.153 --> 01:04:21.823
till we start pickin' them Golden
Delicious and Winter Bananas...

01:04:21.948 --> 01:04:24.701
and Russets and
Baldwins, you know.

01:04:37.005 --> 01:04:39.924
What about worms? Don't
the drops have worms?

01:04:40.008 --> 01:04:44.512
Well, yeah, they got worms, Homer.
That ain't nothin' but protein, man.

01:04:46.806 --> 01:04:49.559
Jack?

01:04:49.643 --> 01:04:52.520
What the hell is you doin', man?

01:04:52.604 --> 01:04:56.733
Don't you know that cigarette's gonna ruin
this whole batch of cider? I can't have that.

01:04:56.816 --> 01:05:00.236
You gonna have to get that out of there.
You're gonna have to go fishin', boy.

01:05:00.362 --> 01:05:02.906
- You mean swimmin'?
- Swimmin' or fishin'.

01:05:02.989 --> 01:05:06.076
I ain't goin' in that vat
to fish out no cigarette.

01:05:09.329 --> 01:05:12.082
Now, Jack...

01:05:12.165 --> 01:05:14.376
Come on down here, man

01:05:32.018 --> 01:05:34.187
What business are you in, Jack?

01:05:36.398 --> 01:05:39.275
Just tell me what
business you're in.

01:05:39.359 --> 01:05:44.072
Just say you're in the apple business 'cause
that's the only business you wanna be in.

01:05:49.828 --> 01:05:53.832
Hey, Jack! Listen, Jack! You don't wanna go
in the knife business with Mr Rose, man.

01:05:53.915 --> 01:05:57.168
- What you wanna do?
- Just tell him you're in the apple business!

01:05:57.252 --> 01:05:59.504
- What you wanna do? What you want, man?
- Jack!

01:05:59.587 --> 01:06:03.091
- Tell him you in the apple business, boy!
- - It ain't worth it.

01:06:03.174 --> 01:06:06.720
- Shut up, Peaches!
- What you want?

01:06:12.434 --> 01:06:16.187
Now, I'm in the knife
business, Jack.

01:06:16.271 --> 01:06:18.481
I'm in the knife business!

01:06:18.565 --> 01:06:22.944
Let me tell ya, you don't wanna be in
no kind of knife business with me.

01:06:23.028 --> 01:06:25.697
Now I think it's time
for you to go fishin'.

01:06:29.617 --> 01:06:31.995
He kind of fast, ain't he, Jack?

01:06:32.078 --> 01:06:36.416
Well, the good news is, you're
already half undressed for swimmin'.

01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:41.546
Shoot, that Jack too
slow to get me.

01:06:41.629 --> 01:06:44.007
I was so fast I cut my own self.

01:06:44.090 --> 01:06:46.343
You really showed him, huh?

01:06:46.426 --> 01:06:49.012
You just about cut
your hand off.

01:06:49.095 --> 01:06:51.348
And all you cut off
him was his clothes.

01:06:51.431 --> 01:06:56.394
Now you know and I know you don't go to
nobody's jail for cuttin' a guy's clothes off.

01:06:56.478 --> 01:06:59.731
Ain't that right? Rose
Rose, ain't that right?

01:06:59.814 --> 01:07:02.067
- Oooh.
- Ain't that right, Homer?

01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:05.987
Easy, easy. Okay. Jus...

01:07:06.071 --> 01:07:07.864
Aaah! God...

01:07:10.617 --> 01:07:12.535
Not too much gas. There you go.

01:07:12.619 --> 01:07:14.829
You wanna go right in here.
Okay, okay, okay!

01:07:14.913 --> 01:07:18.625
Slow on the gas. You
really have to be gentle.

01:07:19.834 --> 01:07:21.920
That's the one. That's the one.

01:07:22.003 --> 01:07:24.255
We wanna stay right there.
Got it?

01:07:26.007 --> 01:07:28.802
Slowly, slowly, slowly.
Okay, okay, okay!

01:07:28.885 --> 01:07:32.681
You're a natural. You were
born to drive a car like this.

01:07:32.764 --> 01:07:36.726
- You think so?
- Yeah. So this is a speaker.

01:07:36.810 --> 01:07:39.229
This is where the sound
for the movie comes out.

01:07:39.312 --> 01:07:42.399
Oh. I love this place.

01:07:42.607 --> 01:07:44.985
This is, uh... Have you
seen a lot of movies here?

01:07:45.068 --> 01:07:47.612
Yes and no.

01:07:47.696 --> 01:07:50.657
When you come here, you don't
really care about the movie.

01:07:51.992 --> 01:07:53.994
You don't care about the movie?

01:07:54.077 --> 01:07:57.831
What are you so crazy
about movies for?

01:07:57.914 --> 01:08:02.460
Ah... That was my favourite night
at the orphanage. Movie night.

01:08:02.544 --> 01:08:06.756
We'd all... We'd all race
into the dining hall,

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:09.634
and, of course, everyone
wanted to sit in front.

01:08:09.718 --> 01:08:14.389
So we'd be packed in so tight you could
feel the kid next to you breathing.

01:08:18.935 --> 01:08:21.354
You don't miss it?

01:08:22.479 --> 01:08:25.692
I miss things. I miss people.

01:08:25.774 --> 01:08:28.028
I miss reading to the boys.

01:08:31.531 --> 01:08:33.825
You had so much
responsibility, huh?

01:08:33.908 --> 01:08:37.328
I didn't ask for any
responsibility.

01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:42.250
Just a little privacy.

01:08:43.585 --> 01:08:45.627
Well, you're in luck.
Let me show you.

01:08:45.712 --> 01:08:49.215
Because privacy is what
drive-in movies are all about.

01:08:49.299 --> 01:08:51.384
So, scrunch down like this.

01:08:52.594 --> 01:08:55.430
Come on. Scrunch down.

01:08:55.513 --> 01:08:57.557
All the way.

01:09:00.185 --> 01:09:02.395
And then give me your arm.

01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:05.689
Put your arm around me.

01:09:07.776 --> 01:09:12.529
You just cuddle and
hug and, you know.

01:09:12.613 --> 01:09:15.158
You don't really
watch the movie.

01:09:15.241 --> 01:09:18.286
I would watch the movie.

01:09:50.484 --> 01:09:53.904
Sorry, Fuzzy. It's
Homer's splice again.

01:10:03.289 --> 01:10:05.417
Fuzzy?

01:10:15.635 --> 01:10:17.762
Fuzz?

01:10:21.099 --> 01:10:23.643
If the little ones want
to know what happened,

01:10:23.727 --> 01:10:28.023
tell them that
Fuzzy was adopted.

01:10:29.899 --> 01:10:34.446
- Okay.
- So, what happened to Fuzzy?

01:10:35.530 --> 01:10:37.991
- He was adopted.
- Good.

01:10:46.416 --> 01:10:49.252
- Will they believe that, you think?
- They'll believe it...

01:10:49.336 --> 01:10:51.671
because they want to believe it.

01:10:55.008 --> 01:10:59.095
- Shouldn't we tell Homer?
- If Homer wanted to know what was happening here,

01:10:59.179 --> 01:11:02.974
he could pick up the
telephone and call us.

01:11:03.058 --> 01:11:08.188
I think it was a nurse or a nanny
who, uh, who adopted Fuzzy.

01:11:08.271 --> 01:11:10.982
Someone who could
take care of him.

01:11:11.066 --> 01:11:14.736
Because they had a better
breathing machine...

01:11:14.819 --> 01:11:17.030
than the one that Dr
Larch built for him.

01:11:17.113 --> 01:11:21.076
So I think we should be
happy for Fuzzy, okay?

01:11:23.370 --> 01:11:27.999
He found a family.
Good night, Fuzzy.

01:11:29.250 --> 01:11:31.378
Good night, Fuzzy.

01:11:39.678 --> 01:11:42.138
Homer. Morning, everybody.

01:11:42.222 --> 01:11:44.224
Mornin', Miss Olive.

01:11:44.307 --> 01:11:46.559
- Look. There's mail for you, Homer.
- Oh, thank you.

01:11:46.643 --> 01:11:51.523
Rose, I brought those clothes for you.
Come on. Let's go see if they fit.

01:11:53.149 --> 01:11:56.236
What's that?

01:11:58.863 --> 01:12:02.867
- Oh, ain't you gonna open it, Homer?
- No.

01:12:02.951 --> 01:12:05.453
Mind your business,
now, Peaches.

01:12:05.537 --> 01:12:07.622
- Sorry 'bout that, Homer.
- It's okay.

01:12:39.738 --> 01:12:43.616
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Oh, look. Right here.

01:12:49.873 --> 01:12:52.667
It's glass. Look at that.

01:12:52.751 --> 01:12:55.337
- Isn't that beautiful?
- Mm-hmm.

01:12:58.131 --> 01:13:01.301
Give me your hand. Feel that.

01:13:04.054 --> 01:13:06.181
- Feel that?
- Mm-hmm.

01:13:08.725 --> 01:13:10.810
The ocean rubs it
against the sand.

01:13:10.894 --> 01:13:12.979
That's how it gets that smooth.

01:13:15.482 --> 01:13:18.026
Takes a year for it to
get like that, though.

01:13:27.869 --> 01:13:30.038
Come on.

01:13:35.126 --> 01:13:37.796
Ah! You're too fast!

01:15:05.550 --> 01:15:07.844
He volunteered.

01:15:07.969 --> 01:15:12.891
Jesus. Nobody volunteers for the Burma run.
He said so himself.

01:15:13.016 --> 01:15:17.854
He just leaves me here. What does he want?
He wants me to wait for him?

01:15:17.979 --> 01:15:19.939
Oh, God, he knows me.

01:15:21.608 --> 01:15:23.818
He knows I'm not
good at being alone.

01:15:28.406 --> 01:15:32.535
This was right. I
know this was right.

01:15:32.619 --> 01:15:34.788
- You're right. This was right.
- Yeah.

01:15:37.165 --> 01:15:41.294
Just tell me. Do you want me to stay?
Do you want me to go?

01:15:42.587 --> 01:15:45.674
I don't know. I
really don't know.

01:15:45.799 --> 01:15:48.551
I just...

01:15:48.635 --> 01:15:50.845
think we should
just wait and see.

01:15:52.931 --> 01:15:54.975
Okay.

01:15:59.688 --> 01:16:02.107
- Are we all set?
- Yeah, that's it.

01:16:05.318 --> 01:16:07.904
Goodbye, Arthur. Thank you
again for all your hard work.

01:16:08.029 --> 01:16:10.949
- My pleasure, ma'am.
- Have a safe trip, Rose. God bless.

01:16:11.074 --> 01:16:13.034
- Take care now.
- Homer, you take care of yourself.

01:16:13.159 --> 01:16:15.120
- Okay. You too. Okay.
- We'll see you next year.

01:16:15.245 --> 01:16:17.205
- Homer, see you later.
- Bye, everyone. - Bye.

01:16:17.330 --> 01:16:21.209
- Don't freeze to death, Homer.
- Don't get yourself in no trouble, Homer.

01:16:21.334 --> 01:16:25.005
- Go on and freeze to death if you want to, Homer.
- Shut up, Jack.

01:16:29.301 --> 01:16:31.928
Take care of yourself, Homer.

01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:53.241
So you're staying.

01:16:55.702 --> 01:16:57.829
Olive told me.

01:16:59.956 --> 01:17:02.083
You know, you could
have told me yourself.

01:17:04.419 --> 01:17:08.715
I'm just waiting and
seeing, like you said.

01:17:37.243 --> 01:17:40.747
Dear Dr Larch, Thank you
for your doctor's bag,

01:17:40.872 --> 01:17:44.292
although it seems that I will not
have the occasion to use it,

01:17:44.376 --> 01:17:46.711
barring some
emergency, of course.

01:17:46.795 --> 01:17:49.839
I'm not a doctor.

01:17:49.923 --> 01:17:54.219
With all due respect to your
profession, I'm enjoying my life here.

01:17:54.302 --> 01:17:57.430
I'm enjoying being a
lobsterman and an orchardman.

01:17:57.514 --> 01:18:01.351
In fact, I've never
enjoyed myself as much.

01:18:01.476 --> 01:18:05.647
The truth is, I want to stay here.
I believe I'm being of some use.

01:18:19.953 --> 01:18:22.038
I've looked at so many women,

01:18:23.581 --> 01:18:25.834
and I've never...

01:18:27.085 --> 01:18:29.087
I've never felt a
thing, you know.

01:18:29.170 --> 01:18:31.172
I mean, I've seen everything.

01:18:32.507 --> 01:18:34.509
Just felt nothing.

01:18:36.094 --> 01:18:38.513
With you, it, uh...

01:18:43.184 --> 01:18:45.395
To look at you, it hurts.

01:18:48.523 --> 01:18:51.484
Come here.

01:19:02.454 --> 01:19:04.456
My dear Homer:

01:19:04.539 --> 01:19:06.750
I thought you were over
your adolescence...

01:19:06.833 --> 01:19:09.461
the first time in our lives
when we imagine we have...

01:19:09.544 --> 01:19:12.714
something terrible to hide
from those who love us.

01:19:16.092 --> 01:19:20.347
- Homer?
- Do you think it's not obvious to us what's happened to you?

01:19:20.430 --> 01:19:22.724
You've fallen in
love, haven't you?

01:19:24.684 --> 01:19:28.813
By the way, whatever you're up to
can't be too good for your heart.

01:19:28.897 --> 01:19:33.068
Then again, it's the sort of condition that
could be made worse by worrying about it,

01:19:33.151 --> 01:19:35.236
so don't worry about it.

01:19:37.989 --> 01:19:41.201
Dear Dr Larch:

01:19:41.284 --> 01:19:44.954
What I'm learning here may not be as
important as what I learned from you,

01:19:45.038 --> 01:19:47.707
but everything is new to me.

01:19:47.791 --> 01:19:50.585
Yesterday, I learned
how to poison mice.

01:19:50.669 --> 01:19:54.631
Field mice girdle an apple tree,
pine mice kill the roots.

01:19:54.714 --> 01:19:57.050
You use poison oats
and poison corn.

01:19:59.427 --> 01:20:03.139
I know what you have to do.
You have to play God.

01:20:03.223 --> 01:20:06.935
Well, killing mice is as close as
I want to come to playing God.

01:20:08.478 --> 01:20:10.480
Homer, here in St. Cloud's,

01:20:10.563 --> 01:20:13.233
I have been given the
opportunity of playing God...

01:20:13.316 --> 01:20:16.820
or leaving practically
everything up to chance.

01:20:16.903 --> 01:20:19.489
Men and women of conscience
should seize those moments...

01:20:19.572 --> 01:20:21.992
when it's possible to play God.

01:20:22.075 --> 01:20:24.160
There won't be many.

01:20:24.244 --> 01:20:26.371
Do I interfere when
absolutely helpless women...

01:20:26.454 --> 01:20:29.332
tell me they simply can't
have an abortion...

01:20:29.416 --> 01:20:33.420
that they simply must go through with
having another and yet another orphan?

01:20:33.503 --> 01:20:37.716
I do not. I do not
even recommend.

01:20:37.799 --> 01:20:40.135
I just give them what they want.

01:20:47.559 --> 01:20:50.103
You are my work of art, Homer.

01:20:50.186 --> 01:20:53.231
Everything else has
been just a job.

01:20:53.315 --> 01:20:56.401
I don't know if you've got
a work of art in you,

01:20:56.484 --> 01:21:00.071
but I know what your job
is: You're a doctor.

01:21:00.155 --> 01:21:02.574
I'm not a doctor.

01:21:02.657 --> 01:21:05.118
You're going to replace me.

01:21:05.201 --> 01:21:07.454
The board of trustees is
looking for my replacement.

01:21:07.537 --> 01:21:09.706
I can't replace you. I'm sorry.

01:21:09.789 --> 01:21:13.001
"Sorry"? I'm not sorry.

01:21:13.084 --> 01:21:16.004
Not for anything I've done.

01:21:16.087 --> 01:21:18.506
I'm not even sorry
that I love you.

01:21:31.770 --> 01:21:34.856
I think we may have
lost him to the world.

01:21:38.401 --> 01:21:41.071
Come on, come on.
Just read the label.

01:21:41.154 --> 01:21:43.239
- Come on. Come on.
- Okay.

01:21:43.323 --> 01:21:46.451
Okay. You can have the book.

01:21:46.534 --> 01:21:49.204
You can have the book, but
please don't tickle me.

01:21:56.920 --> 01:22:00.298
Oh.

01:22:00.382 --> 01:22:03.927
Who is it?

01:22:04.010 --> 01:22:06.554
Don't know.

01:22:12.394 --> 01:22:14.562
It's Mr Rose.

01:22:16.731 --> 01:22:18.400
Hey!

01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:24.990
- Hey, Homer.
- Hero. How ya doin'?

01:22:25.073 --> 01:22:26.950
Good. Miss Candy.

01:22:27.033 --> 01:22:29.411
- Hey, Homer.
- Good to see you again.

01:22:29.494 --> 01:22:31.663
- Thank you.
- Welcome back.

01:22:31.746 --> 01:22:33.748
- Hey, Muddy.
- Hi, Miss Candy.

01:22:33.832 --> 01:22:36.418
- We put in new sheets for you.
- I see you ain't freezed your ass off.

01:22:36.501 --> 01:22:38.586
- It's fine. I'm sure.
- I was just finishing.

01:22:40.130 --> 01:22:42.465
- Hey, Mr Rose.
- Peaches, how are you?

01:22:42.549 --> 01:22:44.676
- Good to see you again.
- Good to see you.

01:22:44.759 --> 01:22:46.928
- Leave it. It's good.
- You sure? - Candy.

01:22:48.263 --> 01:22:51.141
Mr Rose. Welcome back.

01:22:51.224 --> 01:22:53.351
Thank you.

01:22:53.435 --> 01:22:56.688
Don't this place
feel just like home?

01:22:56.771 --> 01:23:00.150
- Nicer than home.
- What you all been doin' make it feel so nice?

01:23:00.233 --> 01:23:02.527
- Hey, Rose.
- Rose, Rose.

01:23:02.610 --> 01:23:06.323
Good to see you again.
How are you?

01:23:06.406 --> 01:23:08.742
Where's Jack?

01:23:08.825 --> 01:23:12.329
He, uh, he just wasn't up
for the trip this season.

01:23:16.708 --> 01:23:19.294
Jack didn't know what
his business was.

01:23:21.296 --> 01:23:24.799
- Ain't that right, Muddy?
- Mm-hmm.

01:23:33.224 --> 01:23:36.186
Muddy, Muddy, half
these is bruised.

01:23:36.269 --> 01:23:38.980
This one ain't got no stem.
What is this, now?

01:23:39.064 --> 01:23:41.900
That's a spur, ain't it?

01:23:41.983 --> 01:23:44.611
You're in too much of a hurry.
What is wrong with you?

01:23:44.694 --> 01:23:46.738
You shakin' the tree to
get these apples down?

01:23:48.907 --> 01:23:51.868
You're bruisin' all
of these apples.

01:24:31.992 --> 01:24:34.160
Ain't you gonna eat
with us, Rose?

01:24:37.330 --> 01:24:41.209
- She used to eat with us.
- Maybe she ain't hungry this mornin'.

01:24:43.670 --> 01:24:45.797
She ain't hungry every mornin',

01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:48.049
'cause she's sick every mornin'.

01:25:01.229 --> 01:25:03.732
Hey, Rose. How you feelin'?

01:25:07.485 --> 01:25:10.780
Guess you must like
watchin' people be sick.

01:25:10.864 --> 01:25:13.283
No, I don't like
watchin' anyone be sick.

01:25:24.002 --> 01:25:27.213
Rose, how many months are you?

01:25:29.674 --> 01:25:31.801
Do you know?

01:25:34.929 --> 01:25:37.265
Do you know? Rose?

01:25:40.727 --> 01:25:43.188
What do you know about it?

01:25:43.271 --> 01:25:46.316
Well, I know more than I'd
like to know about it.

01:25:46.399 --> 01:25:50.278
Well, then, don't trouble
yourself none, Homer.

01:25:50.362 --> 01:25:52.489
This ain't your business.

01:25:57.243 --> 01:25:59.329
Right.

01:26:08.922 --> 01:26:11.883
What am I gonna do with a baby?

01:26:11.966 --> 01:26:14.052
I can't have a baby.

01:26:14.135 --> 01:26:16.137
What am I gonna do with a baby?

01:26:16.221 --> 01:26:20.976
- Huh?
- Whatever you want to do, Rose, I can help.

01:26:25.563 --> 01:26:29.985
I just mean that if you don't wanna
keep the baby, I know where you can go.

01:26:31.569 --> 01:26:35.031
You think Daddy's gonna
let me go anywhere? Huh?

01:26:36.533 --> 01:26:38.785
I ain't goin' nowhere.

01:26:41.538 --> 01:26:45.667
Why don't you just, uh, go
back to your pickin', Homer.

01:26:47.127 --> 01:26:49.629
I can take care of it
by myself, all right?

01:26:51.172 --> 01:26:53.466
What do you mean?

01:26:53.550 --> 01:26:57.679
I mean I could take care
of it by myself. Okay?

01:26:57.762 --> 01:27:00.015
Don't do anything, Rose.

01:27:03.518 --> 01:27:05.520
Don't do anything
to yourself, okay?

01:27:06.813 --> 01:27:09.816
Rose? Do you hear me?

01:27:09.899 --> 01:27:13.028
- Rose, do you hear me?
- Go on! - Homer?

01:27:22.620 --> 01:27:26.583
I think we should take her to St. Cloud's
and let her decide when she gets there.

01:27:26.708 --> 01:27:29.044
I told her. She doesn't
feel she can do that.

01:27:29.169 --> 01:27:31.546
Well, we have to
help her, right?

01:27:35.550 --> 01:27:37.927
We need to do
something, don't we?

01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:44.184
Homer?

01:27:56.613 --> 01:27:58.740
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:28:01.534 --> 01:28:05.830
I have some more clothes for you. I just
keep forgetting to bring them with me.

01:28:05.914 --> 01:28:09.084
I don't need no more clothes.
Thanks.

01:28:17.550 --> 01:28:19.844
I know what's goin' on, Rose.

01:28:19.970 --> 01:28:22.097
Homer told me.

01:28:23.932 --> 01:28:28.311
You don't know this, but I got
pregnant about a year ago.

01:28:36.444 --> 01:28:38.822
Do you want to have this baby?

01:28:41.783 --> 01:28:44.244
No?

01:28:45.495 --> 01:28:48.081
Who's the father? Does he know?

01:28:51.584 --> 01:28:55.630
If you don't want to have this baby, Homer
and I will take you to a place. It's safe.

01:28:55.755 --> 01:28:58.216
- He knows this doc...
- I can't go nowhere.

01:28:59.301 --> 01:29:01.344
Why?

01:29:03.763 --> 01:29:07.100
Rose, listen to me.

01:29:07.183 --> 01:29:09.144
You can tell me.

01:29:12.981 --> 01:29:17.193
It's okay.

01:29:20.989 --> 01:29:24.659
- Mornin'.
- Morning, Mr Rose.

01:29:27.495 --> 01:29:30.248
I'm gonna be up top, okay?

01:29:52.729 --> 01:29:56.066
Mr Rose.

01:29:57.942 --> 01:30:00.403
He's the father.

01:30:00.528 --> 01:30:03.156
- What?
- He's her baby's father.

01:30:03.239 --> 01:30:05.950
Mr Rose is her baby's father.

01:30:06.034 --> 01:30:09.412
Her baby. Mr Rose is the father.

01:30:09.496 --> 01:30:13.541
- What? Are you sure?
- I can't believe this.

01:30:13.625 --> 01:30:17.087
I knew there was something wrong.
What is she gonna do?

01:30:19.214 --> 01:30:23.301
God, I can't believe it. We have to
keep her away from that bastard.

01:30:34.646 --> 01:30:37.315
- Mr Rose?
- Homer.

01:30:37.399 --> 01:30:41.152
I know you ain't ready
for lunch, boy.

01:30:42.696 --> 01:30:45.907
- Is it, uh, true?
- What's that?

01:30:45.991 --> 01:30:48.618
Uh, are you...

01:30:49.828 --> 01:30:51.830
sleeping with your own daughter?

01:31:14.436 --> 01:31:17.480
I think you've been staying
up too late at night, Homer.

01:31:26.823 --> 01:31:28.825
You're having sex with
your own daughter.

01:31:28.908 --> 01:31:32.704
Ain't nobody havin' sex with my daughter!
Let me just tell you that.

01:31:32.787 --> 01:31:36.708
You're lying. Aren't you
ashamed of yourself?

01:31:40.128 --> 01:31:42.130
What do you care who hears?

01:31:42.213 --> 01:31:44.966
I mean, come on. They
know already, don't they?

01:31:45.050 --> 01:31:48.970
- They know, Mr Rose.
- And you know what your business is, boy!

01:31:49.054 --> 01:31:52.474
I know you don't wanna be in
no kind of business with me!

01:31:52.557 --> 01:31:56.353
- That's what I know.
- Yeah? Go on. Cut my clothes. I've got other clothes.

01:31:56.436 --> 01:31:59.689
You gonna come here talkin'
to me about lies and shame?

01:31:59.773 --> 01:32:02.692
Those people took you in, and
that boy Wally is away at war!

01:32:02.776 --> 01:32:05.862
- Yeah, well, she's your daughter!
- And I love her!

01:32:08.031 --> 01:32:10.325
Ain't never gonna do
nothin' to harm her.

01:32:16.915 --> 01:32:18.917
She's pregnant, you know that?
She's pregnant.

01:33:16.516 --> 01:33:19.394
No! No!

01:33:24.774 --> 01:33:27.193
He was over Burma when
he was shot down.

01:33:27.277 --> 01:33:31.031
There were no injuries from
the crash, just disease.

01:33:31.114 --> 01:33:35.952
When the plane was hit, the crew chief
and the radioman jumped close together.

01:33:36.036 --> 01:33:40.165
The co-pilot jumped third, all
on Captain Worthington's orders.

01:33:40.248 --> 01:33:43.835
- Come in.
- The captain was still flying the plane.

01:33:43.918 --> 01:33:47.547
None of the men on the ground could see
the sky. That's how thick the jungle was.

01:33:47.630 --> 01:33:51.801
They never saw the plane crash.
They never heard it crash.

01:33:51.885 --> 01:33:55.180
They never saw Captain
Worthington's parachute either.

01:33:55.263 --> 01:33:57.474
But he was missing for 20 days.
Why?

01:33:57.557 --> 01:34:02.187
He followed the Irrawaddy
River all the way to Rangoon.

01:34:02.270 --> 01:34:06.149
He managed to avoid the Japs
but not the mosquitoes.

01:34:07.317 --> 01:34:09.319
So it's malaria.

01:34:09.402 --> 01:34:11.613
It's, um, encephalitis "B."

01:34:11.696 --> 01:34:13.865
What's that?

01:34:13.948 --> 01:34:18.244
Captain Worthington is
paralysed from the waist down.

01:34:18.328 --> 01:34:20.455
He... He won't walk.

01:34:29.756 --> 01:34:33.259
- I'm sorry.
- When is he coming home?

01:34:33.343 --> 01:34:37.055
In about a month. By
the end of October.

01:34:53.029 --> 01:34:55.532
Just tell me. I'll do
whatever you wanna do.

01:34:56.616 --> 01:34:58.660
Nothing.

01:35:00.954 --> 01:35:03.081
Isn't that like
waiting and seeing?

01:35:06.084 --> 01:35:10.338
No. Nothing's nothing.

01:35:15.176 --> 01:35:17.220
I want Wally to come home.

01:35:20.682 --> 01:35:23.226
I'm afraid to see him too.

01:35:23.310 --> 01:35:27.188
- I know.
- Oh, don't do that, Homer.

01:35:33.695 --> 01:35:36.573
I just want to sit
here and do nothing.

01:35:40.327 --> 01:35:42.620
To do nothing.

01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:47.292
It's a great idea, really.

01:35:47.375 --> 01:35:50.920
Maybe if I just wait
and see long enough,

01:35:51.004 --> 01:35:54.716
then I won't have to do anything
or decide anything, you know?

01:35:54.799 --> 01:35:57.844
I mean, maybe if
I'm lucky enough,

01:35:57.927 --> 01:36:01.890
someone else will decide and
choose and do things for me.

01:36:03.016 --> 01:36:05.101
What are you talking about?

01:36:07.604 --> 01:36:11.733
But then again, maybe I
won't be that lucky.

01:36:14.527 --> 01:36:18.490
And it's not my fault.
It's not your fault.

01:36:20.575 --> 01:36:25.288
And that's just it. Someone's gonna
get hurt, and it's no one's fault.

01:36:25.372 --> 01:36:29.000
- I don't want to talk about this.
- If we just sit here...

01:36:29.084 --> 01:36:32.253
and we wait and see a
little while longer,

01:36:32.337 --> 01:36:36.299
then maybe you won't have to choose,
and I won't have todo anything!

01:36:36.383 --> 01:36:40.428
What do you want from me? Wally's
been shot down. He's paralysed.

01:36:40.512 --> 01:36:42.472
What do you want me to do?

01:36:42.555 --> 01:36:45.850
Nothing. I'm sorry.

01:36:49.938 --> 01:36:53.108
You're not the one who
has to do anything.

01:37:04.619 --> 01:37:07.330
Where you think you're goin'?

01:37:07.414 --> 01:37:09.624
I got to go, Daddy. You
have to let me go.

01:37:09.708 --> 01:37:13.461
Wait, Rose. Just wait. I ain't gonna let
you go nowhere in the middle of the night.

01:37:13.545 --> 01:37:15.547
- Hey. Hey.
- I can't stay here no more, Daddy.

01:37:15.630 --> 01:37:19.259
Hey, nothin'. You just go in the house.
This ain't none of your concern.

01:37:19.342 --> 01:37:21.428
- Just listen to me...
- You are forgettin' yourself now.

01:37:21.511 --> 01:37:24.681
This is my daughter!

01:37:24.764 --> 01:37:27.809
Now, I believe you got your
own mess you gotta deal with.

01:37:27.892 --> 01:37:29.894
- I wanna get...
- Ain't that right, Homer?

01:37:31.187 --> 01:37:33.523
Ain't that right, Homer?

01:37:33.606 --> 01:37:36.318
My daughter and I done told you.
This ain't your business.

01:37:36.401 --> 01:37:39.487
This ain't none
of your business!

01:37:39.571 --> 01:37:43.074
Ya even know what your
business is, Homer? Do ya!

01:37:43.158 --> 01:37:46.286
- What is your business?
- I'm in the doctor business.

01:37:46.369 --> 01:37:49.706
I can help. That's all I'm saying.
I can help.

01:38:16.399 --> 01:38:18.401
Forceps.

01:38:18.485 --> 01:38:22.656
Cervical stabilizer,
vulval pads.

01:38:22.739 --> 01:38:26.743
Set of sims. Set
of reinstadards.

01:38:26.826 --> 01:38:31.206
- Dakin's solution.
- She my little girl, Homer.

01:38:31.289 --> 01:38:35.293
She's gonna be all right, Mr Rose.
Nothin' to worry about.

01:38:42.300 --> 01:38:45.053
You ready, Rose?

01:38:48.723 --> 01:38:50.767
Fellas...

01:38:52.519 --> 01:38:54.604
Come on, y'all.

01:39:05.073 --> 01:39:07.325
I'm staying, Homer.

01:39:08.702 --> 01:39:10.745
Okay.

01:39:10.829 --> 01:39:14.749
If you stay, you
make yourself a use.

01:39:53.621 --> 01:39:56.124
Watch her breathing.

01:40:08.678 --> 01:40:10.680
You better go get some air.

01:40:18.146 --> 01:40:20.357
Oh!

01:40:30.825 --> 01:40:35.747
Oh, God!

01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:50.929
Hey.

01:40:53.264 --> 01:40:55.850
The heat will help the
cramps ease up a little.

01:40:58.311 --> 01:41:01.064
The bleeding is usually a
lot less within two days,

01:41:01.189 --> 01:41:04.025
but you just keep
checking the pad, okay?

01:41:06.277 --> 01:41:09.948
As long as it's not
heavy, it's normal.

01:41:45.692 --> 01:41:51.364
It's that Vernon. He keep askin' where
you, Rose Rose and Homer is at.

01:41:51.448 --> 01:41:54.451
Tell that Vernon to mind
his own business, Muddy.

01:41:56.870 --> 01:41:59.622
Told him y'all sick.

01:41:59.706 --> 01:42:02.459
You tell him whatever you want.

01:42:02.542 --> 01:42:05.003
You crew boss today.

01:42:19.392 --> 01:42:22.520
- You readin' the rules, Homer?
- Mm-hmm.

01:42:23.897 --> 01:42:25.857
What are they?

01:42:27.942 --> 01:42:30.028
Uh...

01:42:31.738 --> 01:42:33.782
"Please don't smoke in bed."

01:42:33.865 --> 01:42:36.785
We already heard
that one, Homer.

01:42:36.868 --> 01:42:42.415
"Two: Please don't operate the grinder
or press if you've been drinking."

01:42:42.499 --> 01:42:46.628
"Three: Please don't go up to
the roof to eat your lunch."

01:42:46.711 --> 01:42:48.713
That's the best
place to eat lunch.

01:42:48.797 --> 01:42:52.550
"Four: Please, even
if you are very hot,

01:42:52.676 --> 01:42:54.678
do not go up to the
roof to sleep."

01:42:54.761 --> 01:42:58.098
What do they think, go
up to the roof to sleep?

01:42:58.181 --> 01:43:00.642
- They must think we're crazy.
- They think we dumb niggers,

01:43:00.767 --> 01:43:03.103
so we need some dumb
rules, is what they think.

01:43:03.186 --> 01:43:05.563
The last one.

01:43:05.647 --> 01:43:09.067
"There should be no going
up on the roof at night."

01:43:09.150 --> 01:43:13.822
Now, why don't they just say,
"Don't go up on the roof"?

01:43:13.905 --> 01:43:17.283
- That's it?
- That's it.

01:43:17.367 --> 01:43:21.955
- Hmm.
- It don't mean nothin' at all.

01:43:22.038 --> 01:43:26.418
- And all this time I been wonderin' about 'em.
- They outrageous, them rules.

01:43:28.837 --> 01:43:30.964
Who live in this cider house?

01:43:37.053 --> 01:43:41.891
Who grindin' up those apples,
pressin' that cider,

01:43:41.975 --> 01:43:44.102
cleanin' up all this mess?

01:43:46.646 --> 01:43:51.276
Who just plain live here, just
breathin' in that vinegar?

01:43:55.447 --> 01:43:59.743
Well, someone who don't
live here made those rules.

01:44:02.746 --> 01:44:06.082
These rules ain't for us.

01:44:06.166 --> 01:44:09.461
We the ones supposed
to make our own rules.

01:44:11.046 --> 01:44:13.465
And we do.

01:44:13.548 --> 01:44:15.800
Every single day.

01:44:19.596 --> 01:44:21.640
Ain't that right, Homer?

01:44:22.724 --> 01:44:24.643
That's right.

01:44:27.395 --> 01:44:30.482
Then why don't you burn
them rules in the stove?

01:44:32.275 --> 01:44:34.819
Go 'head, Homer. Do it.

01:45:14.859 --> 01:45:16.987
Nothing is nothing, right?

01:45:19.322 --> 01:45:21.366
You know I love you.

01:45:22.867 --> 01:45:25.328
You know I do.

01:45:25.412 --> 01:45:27.539
You needed me.

01:45:28.832 --> 01:45:31.668
Now Wally's gonna need you.

01:45:31.751 --> 01:45:33.378
Homer.

01:45:37.841 --> 01:45:40.093
I'm sorry.

01:45:42.304 --> 01:45:45.390
At least there's no more
waiting and seeing.

01:45:48.059 --> 01:45:51.438
At least I got to see the ocean.

01:46:06.453 --> 01:46:10.457
Homer! Rose Rose done run away.

01:46:10.540 --> 01:46:14.419
- She took off in the middle of the night.
- She left on the bicycle.

01:46:14.502 --> 01:46:16.546
What?

01:46:20.967 --> 01:46:23.053
Nobody gonna find her.

01:46:23.136 --> 01:46:25.597
She long gone.

01:46:27.891 --> 01:46:30.644
I didn't try stop her.

01:46:30.727 --> 01:46:33.438
I just want to touch her
hand before she go.

01:46:34.564 --> 01:46:36.608
That's all I wanna do.

01:46:37.776 --> 01:46:40.153
That's all.

01:46:40.236 --> 01:46:42.322
I swear.

01:46:43.573 --> 01:46:46.242
Where she get that knife, Muddy?

01:46:46.326 --> 01:46:49.371
Look like your knife.

01:46:49.454 --> 01:46:51.539
No gal need to be out here
tryin' to hitch-hike...

01:46:51.623 --> 01:46:55.293
unless she got a good,
strong knife to hold onto.

01:46:56.836 --> 01:46:58.922
Where'd she get you?

01:46:59.005 --> 01:47:04.219
Just misunderstood me.

01:47:04.302 --> 01:47:08.139
I was tryin' to give her my knife, and
I reach out my hand to touch her.

01:47:08.223 --> 01:47:11.935
But see, I understand, Homer,

01:47:12.018 --> 01:47:14.270
if she don't see it like that.

01:47:14.354 --> 01:47:16.898
It's my fault.

01:47:16.982 --> 01:47:19.442
She good with that knife.

01:47:19.526 --> 01:47:22.779
She's fast.

01:47:22.862 --> 01:47:25.532
She a lot better with that
knife than you is, Muddy.

01:47:25.615 --> 01:47:28.034
Who do you suppose taught her?

01:47:29.536 --> 01:47:32.455
- You taught her, I suppose.
- That's right.

01:47:32.539 --> 01:47:35.667
That's right.

01:47:35.750 --> 01:47:37.794
There's more than one cut.

01:47:37.877 --> 01:47:41.715
That's 'cause I take my knife
and stick it in the wound.

01:47:41.798 --> 01:47:44.718
I stick my own knife in there.

01:47:44.801 --> 01:47:47.012
I poked it all around, Homer,

01:47:48.513 --> 01:47:51.349
tryin' to find the same
spot that she got.

01:47:52.684 --> 01:47:55.812
Now, look here.

01:47:55.895 --> 01:47:59.316
When you tell the police
how this happened,

01:47:59.399 --> 01:48:02.736
I want you to tell
it like this, hear?

01:48:02.819 --> 01:48:08.366
My daughter run off. I was so sad
about that, I stabbed myself.

01:48:08.450 --> 01:48:11.536
I was so unhappy that
she left that...

01:48:13.788 --> 01:48:15.790
I killed my own self.

01:48:15.874 --> 01:48:18.710
And that's the truth.

01:48:18.793 --> 01:48:20.879
Ain't that right?

01:48:23.715 --> 01:48:25.717
I wanna hear you say that.

01:48:25.800 --> 01:48:28.595
I was so unhappy that
my daughter run off...

01:48:30.805 --> 01:48:33.099
That...

01:48:33.183 --> 01:48:35.226
I killed my own self.

01:48:36.645 --> 01:48:39.939
- Ain't that right, Homer?
- That's right.

01:48:40.023 --> 01:48:44.235
- Huh, Muddy?
- Yeah, that's what happened.

01:48:44.319 --> 01:48:48.365
You lost your only daughter, so's you
killed yourself. That's what we say.

01:48:48.448 --> 01:48:53.119
That's right. That's the truth.

01:48:53.203 --> 01:48:55.538
I'm just tryin' to
put things straight.

01:48:55.622 --> 01:48:59.250
Sometimes you gotta
break some rules,

01:48:59.334 --> 01:49:01.544
put things straight.

01:49:03.713 --> 01:49:05.924
Ain't that right, Homer?

01:49:14.099 --> 01:49:16.226
Good.

01:50:15.577 --> 01:50:17.829
Do you think Rose will be okay?

01:50:17.912 --> 01:50:21.124
She'll be all right. She knows
how to take care of herself.

01:50:27.339 --> 01:50:30.258
This is for you. Olive
wanted me to bring it.

01:50:30.342 --> 01:50:32.510
Oh, thanks.

01:50:39.225 --> 01:50:43.063
I know you don't think much of being
needed, or of me for that matter, but l...

01:50:43.146 --> 01:50:47.025
I'm sorry for what I said
about Wally needing you.

01:50:47.108 --> 01:50:49.319
It was unnecessary.

01:50:52.072 --> 01:50:54.199
You had every right to be angry.

01:50:56.242 --> 01:50:58.328
No, you warned me.

01:50:58.411 --> 01:51:04.000
You told me you weren't
any good at being alone.

01:51:15.553 --> 01:51:18.473
Wally's gonna be okay.

01:51:18.556 --> 01:51:20.558
I know he is.

01:51:21.685 --> 01:51:23.728
Yeah?

01:52:09.190 --> 01:52:14.112
Dear Homer: I am writing you
to tell you about Dr Larch.

01:53:15.757 --> 01:53:17.842
Dr Larch?

01:53:20.011 --> 01:53:22.180
Dr Larch?

01:53:30.313 --> 01:53:32.440
Wilbur.

01:53:32.565 --> 01:53:34.693
Oh, Wilbur.

01:53:35.986 --> 01:53:38.113
Wilbur.

01:53:39.864 --> 01:53:42.784
And saw the splendour
of the moonlight

01:53:42.867 --> 01:53:47.747
On Honolulu Bay

01:53:47.831 --> 01:53:52.460
There's something tender in
the moonlight on Honolulu Bay

01:53:52.585 --> 01:53:54.879
I can assure you
that the overdose...

01:53:54.963 --> 01:53:57.090
was entirely accidental.

01:54:08.727 --> 01:54:12.063
Let us be happy for Dr Larch.

01:54:12.147 --> 01:54:17.360
Dr Larch has found a family.
Good night, Dr Larch.

01:54:17.444 --> 01:54:19.904
Good night, Dr Larch.

01:54:37.756 --> 01:54:40.300
- Come on, Muddy.
- Step on it, man!

01:54:40.425 --> 01:54:44.471
- Let's get on it.
- Get on it, man. I wanna get to the sunshine.

01:54:44.554 --> 01:54:46.848
- Ha-ha-ha!
- Homer!

01:54:46.973 --> 01:54:49.267
- Yeah!
- You ever seen a palm tree?

01:54:49.351 --> 01:54:51.394
Oh, he ain't never
been outta Maine!

01:54:51.478 --> 01:54:54.105
Ain't you sick of
pine trees, Homer?

01:54:54.189 --> 01:54:57.233
- Let me tell you something about Florida, Homer.
- - The sun shines!

01:54:57.317 --> 01:55:00.528
Man, it's so warm down there,
you can pick grapefruits...

01:55:00.612 --> 01:55:03.073
and oranges naked
if you want to.

01:55:03.198 --> 01:55:05.950
- Who would want to do that?
- - I'm just sayin' it's warm, Hero.

01:55:06.034 --> 01:55:09.621
You used to say it was too hot.

01:55:09.746 --> 01:55:11.623
Not me.

01:55:12.791 --> 01:55:15.752
I love them peaches.

01:55:15.835 --> 01:55:19.756
I love my peaches.

01:55:19.839 --> 01:55:23.760
Homer? Hey, what
you think, Homer?

01:55:23.885 --> 01:55:26.346
I'd love to go with you guys,

01:55:26.471 --> 01:55:28.848
but I have to move on.

01:55:33.228 --> 01:55:35.522
- Hey, you hear that, Muddy?
- What?

01:55:35.605 --> 01:55:38.525
- Boy said he ain't movin' on with us.
- Oh, Homer!

01:55:38.608 --> 01:55:42.320
Come on, Homer. Come
on down with us!

01:55:42.404 --> 01:55:47.575
- I can't do it, guys.
- Well, I reckon you gotta do what you gotta do.

01:55:53.832 --> 01:55:57.544
O Lord, support us
all the day long...

01:55:57.627 --> 01:56:02.340
until the shadows lengthen
and the evening comes...

01:56:02.424 --> 01:56:07.929
and the busy world is hushed and the fever
of life is over and our work is done.

01:56:08.013 --> 01:56:12.475
Then, in Thy mercy, grant us a
safe lodging and a holy rest...

01:56:12.559 --> 01:56:15.603
and peace at the last.

01:56:15.687 --> 01:56:17.772
Amen.

01:57:18.667 --> 01:57:21.252
Homer?

01:57:24.005 --> 01:57:27.008
Homer! It's Homer!

01:57:27.092 --> 01:57:30.637
Homer!

01:57:36.768 --> 01:57:38.853
Hey, Buster!

01:57:38.937 --> 01:57:41.022
Homer!

01:58:00.709 --> 01:58:05.797
- I was in Maine.
- Oh, look! Here comes Jennifer!

01:58:05.880 --> 01:58:08.550
Let me see.

01:58:08.633 --> 01:58:12.512
You're welcome. You're welcome.
It was my pleasure.

01:58:12.595 --> 01:58:15.015
It's gonna be chicken
fricassee tonight.

01:58:20.770 --> 01:58:23.565
- What's this?
- That's Homer's.

01:58:25.358 --> 01:58:27.819
You have something for me?

01:58:27.902 --> 01:58:30.655
Do I have something for you?

01:58:30.739 --> 01:58:35.285
Uh, let... You know what?
I have something.

01:58:35.744 --> 01:58:37.495
I do. Here.

01:58:39.539 --> 01:58:41.624
It's from the ocean.
It's for you.

01:58:41.708 --> 01:58:45.170
- What do you think?
- Good.

01:58:45.253 --> 01:58:48.131
- I made a room up for you.
- We thought that would be more comfortable.

01:58:48.214 --> 01:58:51.509
Oh, thank you. That
would be great.

01:58:51.593 --> 01:58:54.679
- You're not staying in here?
- I don't know.

01:58:54.763 --> 01:58:56.765
What do you think, Curly?

01:58:56.848 --> 01:58:58.933
What else do you have, Homer?

01:58:59.017 --> 01:59:02.646
- Do you have something else for me?
- Do you know what this is?

01:59:02.729 --> 01:59:07.609
- Oh, that's my heart.
- No, actually, it's Fuzzy's.

01:59:07.734 --> 01:59:09.944
There's nothing wrong
with your heart.

01:59:10.070 --> 01:59:15.533
Dr Larch wanted to keep you out of the war.
That's why he told you it was yours.

01:59:18.453 --> 01:59:20.914
I think he was worried
about his own heart.

01:59:21.039 --> 01:59:25.377
He said it would never stand up
to Homer Wells going off to war.

01:59:53.488 --> 01:59:55.699
"Thus I began my new life...

01:59:55.824 --> 02:00:00.662
"in a new name and with
everything new about me.

02:00:00.787 --> 02:00:03.623
"I felt like one in a dream.

02:00:03.707 --> 02:00:08.086
"The remembrance of my old life is
fraught with so much want of hope.

02:00:08.169 --> 02:00:11.589
"Whether it lasted for a year
or more or less I do not know.

02:00:13.049 --> 02:00:15.302
"I only know that it was...

02:00:15.427 --> 02:00:17.470
"and ceased to be.

02:00:18.930 --> 02:00:20.974
And there I leave it."

02:00:24.853 --> 02:00:27.272
Is that all?

02:00:28.648 --> 02:00:30.942
No, there's much
more to come, Curly.

02:00:32.068 --> 02:00:34.029
Well, that's tomorrow.

02:00:34.154 --> 02:00:36.281
Let's not give the story away.

02:00:46.082 --> 02:00:48.543
Good night, you
Princes of Maine,

02:00:48.626 --> 02:00:51.546
you Kings of New England.
