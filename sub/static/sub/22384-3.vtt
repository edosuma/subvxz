00:21.521 --> 00:22.521
Dusty!

00:23.565 --> 00:25.191
Dusty, how was it?

00:25.275 --> 00:26.609
How was what?

00:27.193 --> 00:30.071
"How was what?"
The greatest night of the year, of course.

00:30.155 --> 00:33.742
Oh. Oh, yeah, it was...
It was, uh, tubular.

00:33.825 --> 00:35.535
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

00:35.618 --> 00:37.704
- Did something happen?
- No. What? No.

00:37.787 --> 00:39.205
Are you constipated again?

00:39.289 --> 00:40.498
No. Mom!

00:40.582 --> 00:41.791
Okay, you're acting weird.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.376
I am not acting weird!

00:43.460 --> 00:44.461
- Whoa!
- Ah!

00:47.130 --> 00:50.675
Awesome, right? Yeah...
I rigged the trap with, uh,

00:50.759 --> 00:53.344
a motor to make it look like
I caught a ghost.

00:53.428 --> 00:54.596
Just like the movie.

00:54.679 --> 00:57.182
- Oh, Dusty.
- Yeah.

01:01.811 --> 01:04.688
Funny. Look at that. Look at that.

01:11.446 --> 01:13.281
I told you to keep quiet.

01:13.364 --> 01:16.534
All you had to do was stay still
for one minute.

01:16.618 --> 01:17.911
One minute.

01:19.996 --> 01:21.581
Sorry, Yertle.

01:21.664 --> 01:23.333
Temporary eviction, buddy.

01:34.260 --> 01:36.012
What are you, little guy?

01:40.391 --> 01:42.268
What were you doing in my trash?

01:43.394 --> 01:44.729
You hungry?

01:59.828 --> 02:00.828
Nougat.

02:01.329 --> 02:03.289
Go on, eat.

02:05.625 --> 02:06.625
Too hot?

02:08.711 --> 02:10.338
Sorry about that, little guy.

02:14.592 --> 02:16.052
You like nougat, too, huh?

02:19.055 --> 02:20.807
You're pretty cute, you know that?

02:20.890 --> 02:23.059
I'm glad I found you.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.231
D'Artagnan.

02:28.773 --> 02:30.775
I'm gonna call you d'Artagnan.

05:15.356 --> 05:16.691
Rise and shine.

05:22.488 --> 05:25.074
So that's it, huh?
You're still not talking?

05:28.828 --> 05:29.829
All right.

05:30.830 --> 05:33.916
I guess I'm just gonna have to, uh...

05:34.000 --> 05:37.336
enjoy this triple-decker
Eggo extravaganza on my own.

05:50.433 --> 05:51.434
Mmm!

05:52.185 --> 05:53.478
Mmm!

05:53.561 --> 05:54.562
Good, right?

05:55.355 --> 05:57.565
Know the great thing about it?
It's only 8,000 calories.

06:07.241 --> 06:08.868
You visited him again last night?

06:13.498 --> 06:14.707
He says he needs me.

06:16.250 --> 06:17.330
Want me to go check on him?

06:18.961 --> 06:20.401
I know that you miss him, all right?

06:21.589 --> 06:23.132
But it's too dangerous.

06:24.884 --> 06:27.220
You're the last thing he needs right now.

06:27.970 --> 06:29.889
You're gonna see him. Soon.

06:29.972 --> 06:34.143
And not just in that head of yours.
You're gonna see him in real life.

06:35.103 --> 06:37.814
I feel like I'm making progress
with these people.

06:38.606 --> 06:40.608
Friends don't lie.

06:40.691 --> 06:41.691
What?

06:41.734 --> 06:44.070
You say "soon" on day 21.

06:44.153 --> 06:47.448
You say "soon" on day 205.

06:48.032 --> 06:51.661
- You now say "soon" on day 326?
- What is this?

06:51.744 --> 06:54.224
You're counting the days now
like you're some kind of prisoner?

06:54.288 --> 06:56.290
When is "soon"?

06:56.374 --> 06:58.084
"Soon" is when...

06:58.751 --> 07:00.670
it's not dangerous anymore.

07:00.753 --> 07:02.088
When?

07:05.258 --> 07:06.926
- I don't know.
- On day 500?

07:07.009 --> 07:08.344
- I don't know.
- On day 600?

07:08.427 --> 07:10.179
- I don't know.
- Day 700?

07:10.263 --> 07:11.639
- On day 800?
- No!

07:11.722 --> 07:13.402
- I need to see him. Tell me!
- I said I...

07:13.850 --> 07:17.103
Oh! Shit! Shit!

07:17.645 --> 07:20.606
Friends don't lie!

07:27.905 --> 07:29.824
Jesus. Have you seen them?

07:30.408 --> 07:33.369
- We're looking, Mom.
- Yeah, we're... we're looking.

07:33.453 --> 07:36.080
- A-ha! Found 'em.
- Oh!

07:36.164 --> 07:38.004
Hiding under some jeans,
sneaky little buggers.

07:38.082 --> 07:40.751
Thank you. Thank you.
You're a life saver.

07:40.835 --> 07:43.379
Can you take Will to school today?
I cannot be late again.

07:43.463 --> 07:46.632
- He's staying over now?
- Can you just take Will, please?

07:46.716 --> 07:48.009
I can take him.

07:48.676 --> 07:51.554
- Will you make sure he gets in okay?
- Yeah, of course.

07:51.637 --> 07:54.117
What do you say, big guy?
Wanna go for a ride in the Bobmobile?

08:19.999 --> 08:23.294
Mr. Henderson, you know the rules.
Five at a time.

08:23.377 --> 08:24.377
Yep.

08:24.837 --> 08:27.632
One, two, three, four and five.

08:28.716 --> 08:29.717
Ten.

08:30.134 --> 08:31.928
You already have five books checked out.

08:32.010 --> 08:33.221
My mistake.

08:33.929 --> 08:34.972
However...

08:35.765 --> 08:39.727
I am on a curiosity voyage,
and I need my paddles to travel.

08:39.809 --> 08:41.479
These books...

08:42.395 --> 08:44.190
These books are my paddles.

08:45.316 --> 08:48.069
Five at a time.

08:48.152 --> 08:50.321
- Are you shitting me?
- Excuse me?

08:51.072 --> 08:52.198
What the hell is...

08:53.824 --> 08:56.035
- Mr. Henderson!
- I need my paddles!

09:05.419 --> 09:08.256
Was that you I heard milling around
last night, or was that a ghost?

09:08.339 --> 09:10.508
Yeah. Me, probably.

09:12.301 --> 09:15.721
- Another nightmare?
- Um... no.

09:18.766 --> 09:20.351
Did I ever tell you about Mr. Baldo?

09:21.894 --> 09:24.105
- Mr. Baldo?
- Yeah.

09:24.939 --> 09:26.524
I was a little younger than you,

09:26.607 --> 09:29.193
standing in line for the Ferris wheel
at the Roane County fair.

09:29.277 --> 09:31.028
- Mmm-hmm.
- And suddenly,

09:31.112 --> 09:33.823
I feel this fat white glove
tap me on the shoulder.

09:33.906 --> 09:36.158
I spin around, and there he is.

09:36.742 --> 09:37.743
Mr. Baldo.

09:38.327 --> 09:41.372
"Hey, kiddo, would you like a balloon?"

09:41.956 --> 09:44.458
Go ahead, laugh. It's funny.

09:44.542 --> 09:46.961
It wasn't funny back then,
I can tell you that.

09:48.170 --> 09:50.381
I couldn't get him out of my head.

09:50.464 --> 09:53.467
Every night, he would come
to me in my dreams.

09:53.551 --> 09:55.177
And every night when he came to me...

09:55.803 --> 09:56.803
I ran.

09:57.722 --> 10:02.059
It got so bad that I made
my mom stay in the room with me

10:02.143 --> 10:04.145
until I could fall asleep every night.

10:05.229 --> 10:06.397
- Really?
- Really.

10:06.981 --> 10:08.899
It went on like that for months.

10:08.983 --> 10:12.320
And then one day,
the nightmares suddenly stopped.

10:14.238 --> 10:16.032
- Wanna know how?
- How?

10:17.575 --> 10:19.160
Well, I fell asleep...

10:19.827 --> 10:23.372
and just like always,
Mr. Baldo came to me.

10:23.998 --> 10:26.667
Only this time, I didn't run.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.670
This time, I stood my ground.

10:30.254 --> 10:32.506
I just looked at Mr. Baldo

10:32.590 --> 10:35.926
in his stupid face, and I said,
"Go away. Go away!"

10:38.763 --> 10:41.557
Just like that, he was gone.

10:42.433 --> 10:43.517
Never saw him again.

10:45.144 --> 10:46.479
Easy-peasy, right?

10:48.522 --> 10:49.649
Easy-peasy.

10:49.732 --> 10:50.941
Just like that.

10:52.735 --> 10:55.154
I still don't get why
they call him zombie boy.

10:55.237 --> 10:57.877
I mean, I get it. He got lost in the woods
for a week or something,

10:57.907 --> 11:01.285
but why is he a zombie?
Because everyone thought he was dead?

11:01.369 --> 11:04.914
Yeah. I mean, we had a funeral
for him and everything.

11:04.997 --> 11:06.582
After a week?

11:06.666 --> 11:09.960
Well, see,
some other kid drowned at the quarry.

11:10.044 --> 11:12.713
We thought it was Will
because his body was super decomposed.

11:12.797 --> 11:13.797
What?

11:13.839 --> 11:15.424
Okay, that's not funny.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.593
It's not a joke, all right?
It's public knowledge.

11:17.676 --> 11:19.095
You can ask anybody.

11:19.178 --> 11:21.889
Except Will,
because he is really sensitive about it.

11:21.972 --> 11:22.973
All right?

11:23.849 --> 11:24.849
Okay.

11:31.232 --> 11:32.650
Have a great day, kiddo.

11:39.824 --> 11:41.343
The case of Phineas Gage

11:41.367 --> 11:43.953
is one of the great medical curiosities
of all time.

11:44.036 --> 11:49.166
Phineas was a railroad worker in 1848
who had a nightmarish accident.

11:49.250 --> 11:52.878
A large iron rod was driven
completely through his head.

11:54.088 --> 11:57.967
Phineas miraculously survived.
He seemed fine.

11:58.050 --> 12:00.386
And physically, yes, he was.

12:01.011 --> 12:04.348
But his injury resulted
in a complete change to his personality.

12:04.932 --> 12:07.476
So much so that friends that knew him

12:07.560 --> 12:10.896
started referring to him
as "No longer Gage."

12:10.980 --> 12:13.858
At the time, this was known
as the American Crowbar Case.

12:13.941 --> 12:15.276
Although it wasn't a...

12:15.359 --> 12:17.611
I am so sorry, Mr. Clarke.

12:17.695 --> 12:20.656
Really, I'm so sorry.
Please continue with the class.

12:20.739 --> 12:21.782
Don't mind me.

12:21.866 --> 12:24.076
Really, continue, please. Thanks.

12:24.952 --> 12:28.539
Although it wasn't a crowbar,
it was a rod, as I said.

12:28.622 --> 12:32.209
We have to meet. All of us.
At lunch, AV Club.

12:32.293 --> 12:33.210
Why?

12:33.294 --> 12:36.130
I have something that you won't believe.

12:38.883 --> 12:40.468
AV Club. Lunch.

12:41.469 --> 12:43.387
- Dustin!
- Yes, my lord?

12:43.471 --> 12:45.806
- Would you care to join the class now?
- Please, yes.

12:45.890 --> 12:47.850
- The case of Phineas Gage.
- Phineas Gage.

12:47.933 --> 12:50.769
- Page 104.
- 104. 104.

12:50.853 --> 12:53.189
- Focus.
- Focusing. Focusing.

12:53.981 --> 12:55.065
AV Club.

12:57.359 --> 12:59.570
And he began to curse,
using terrible words

12:59.653 --> 13:02.490
that I don't dare repeat here.

13:08.370 --> 13:10.581
And we found
some more by Gilbert's farm.

13:10.664 --> 13:12.249
Some real nasty stuff.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.376
- It was sticky.
- All right. Where else?

13:16.837 --> 13:17.880
That was it, Chief.

13:17.963 --> 13:19.673
That was it,
or you get tired of looking?

13:20.257 --> 13:23.844
- It was getting dark.
- I mean, it was really dark.

13:23.928 --> 13:25.888
They're called flashlights, you dipshits.

13:25.971 --> 13:29.934
Oh, okay. Someone woke up
on the wrong side of the bed this morning.

13:30.518 --> 13:32.228
More lady problems, Chief?

13:51.205 --> 13:54.792
Hey, Chief! Where you going?

13:54.875 --> 13:56.669
You want us to go back out there?

13:56.752 --> 13:59.088
- Why's he gotta kick the door?
- Hey, Chief!

14:59.273 --> 15:00.833
My granddad used to live here.

15:02.151 --> 15:03.652
Long time ago.

15:04.987 --> 15:07.281
I mainly just use it for storage now.

15:10.576 --> 15:12.202
Lot of history here.

15:19.668 --> 15:21.879
So, uh... what do you think?

15:22.880 --> 15:25.299
It's a work-in-progress.
You know, it's, uh...

15:26.592 --> 15:29.428
It takes a little imagination, but, uh...

15:29.511 --> 15:31.513
once we fix it up,
it's gonna be nice.

15:32.348 --> 15:33.349
Real nice.

15:35.559 --> 15:36.685
This is your new home.

15:41.398 --> 15:42.399
Home.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.783
Oh, yeah.

15:50.866 --> 15:52.451
Yeah, yeah.

15:53.118 --> 15:54.119

Okay.

17:41.018 --> 17:44.688
Now, this is called a trip wire.

17:44.772 --> 17:46.774
It's like an alarm.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.987
You, uh, set it up like this.

17:52.071 --> 17:55.115
And then, anybody gets close,

17:55.199 --> 17:59.203
it's gonna make a loud noise
like, uh, gunfire.

17:59.286 --> 18:01.038
Bang!

18:04.917 --> 18:06.752
Those bad men aren't gonna find ya.

18:08.170 --> 18:09.713
All right? Not way the hell out here.

18:10.339 --> 18:11.673
We'll take some precautions.

18:13.634 --> 18:15.552
There's gonna be a couple ground rules.

18:17.346 --> 18:18.346
Rule number one:

18:19.139 --> 18:20.933
always keep the curtains drawn.

18:23.435 --> 18:24.686
Rule number two:

18:25.521 --> 18:28.982
only open the door
if you hear my secret knock.

18:35.489 --> 18:36.532
And rule number three:

18:37.407 --> 18:40.911
don't ever go out alone,
especially not in the daylight.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.836
That's it. Three rules.

18:49.419 --> 18:50.963
I call 'em the, uh...

18:52.089 --> 18:53.549
Don't Be Stupid Rules.

18:55.592 --> 18:57.010
'Cause we're not stupid.

18:57.719 --> 18:58.719
Right?

18:59.596 --> 19:00.722
Not stupid.

19:20.367 --> 19:22.911
Harrington, right?

19:22.995 --> 19:25.956
I heard you used to run this school.
That true?

19:26.039 --> 19:28.333
King Steve, they used to call you, huh?

19:29.126 --> 19:30.210
Then you turned bitch.

19:30.294 --> 19:32.575
Hey, maybe you should just shut up
and just play the game.

19:38.635 --> 19:39.636
Whoo!

19:40.220 --> 19:43.557
That's what I'm talking about! Whoo!

19:43.640 --> 19:44.641
Steve?

19:46.894 --> 19:48.937
- What are you doing here?
- What do you think?

19:49.021 --> 19:51.565
Where were you this morning?
I missed first period.

19:51.648 --> 19:53.025
I figured Jonathan would take you.

19:53.734 --> 19:55.903
Wha... What are you talking about?

19:55.986 --> 19:58.405
Jesus,
you really can't handle your alcohol.

19:58.488 --> 19:59.489
Uh...

20:00.240 --> 20:02.910
You remember going
to Tina's party last night, right?

20:02.993 --> 20:04.786
- Yes.
- And then what?

20:04.870 --> 20:07.873
I remember dancing, and...

20:08.624 --> 20:09.833
spilling some punch.

20:09.917 --> 20:12.544
You got mad at me because I was drunk...

20:13.086 --> 20:14.838
and then you took me home.

20:14.922 --> 20:17.216
No, see, that's where
your mind gets a little bit fuzzy.

20:17.299 --> 20:20.052
That was your other boyfriend.
That was... That was Jonathan.

20:20.135 --> 20:22.679
- I don't understand.
- It's pretty simple, Nancy.

20:22.763 --> 20:24.681
- You were just telling it like it is.
- What?

20:24.765 --> 20:25.765
Uh...

20:26.475 --> 20:27.976
apparently, uh...

20:28.685 --> 20:32.773
we killed Barb and I don't care,
'cause I'm bullshit...

20:32.856 --> 20:36.485
and our whole... our whole relationship
is bullshit, and...

20:36.568 --> 20:39.248
I mean, pretty much everything
is just bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.

20:39.279 --> 20:41.490
Oh, yeah, also, you don't love me.

20:41.573 --> 20:44.576
I was drunk, Steve.
I don't remember any of that.

20:44.660 --> 20:47.537
So that makes everything that you said...
It's what? Just bullshit, too?

20:47.621 --> 20:48.956
- Yes.
- Well, then tell me.

20:49.039 --> 20:50.374
Tell you what?

20:50.874 --> 20:52.000
You love me.

20:54.336 --> 20:55.545
Really?

20:55.629 --> 20:56.630
Harrington!

20:56.713 --> 20:59.383
Dude, we need you, man.
That douchebag's killing us. Let's go!

20:59.466 --> 21:00.717
- All right!
- Come on!

21:08.308 --> 21:09.893
I think that you're bullshit.

21:18.527 --> 21:20.237
His name is d'Artagnan.

21:27.202 --> 21:28.203
Cute, right?

21:28.745 --> 21:31.123
- D'Artagnan?
- Dart for short.

21:31.707 --> 21:35.043
- And he was in your trash?
- Foraging for food.

21:36.086 --> 21:37.546
- You wanna hold him?
- No, no.

21:37.629 --> 21:39.148
- He doesn't bite.
- I don't want to...

21:39.172 --> 21:40.632
Oh, God, he's slimy!

21:41.758 --> 21:43.635
Ugh, he's like a living booger.

21:43.719 --> 21:45.470
Ugh, oh, God!

21:50.058 --> 21:51.143
What is he?

21:52.102 --> 21:53.979
My question exactly.

21:55.272 --> 21:57.607
At first, I thought
it was some type of pollywog.

21:57.691 --> 22:00.652
- Pollywog?
- It's another word for tadpole.

22:00.736 --> 22:03.497
- A tadpole is the larval stage of a toad.
- I know what a tadpole is.

22:03.530 --> 22:06.867
All right, then you know
that most tadpoles are aquatic, right?

22:06.950 --> 22:08.910
Well, Dart, he isn't.
He doesn't need water.

22:08.994 --> 22:11.121
Yeah, but aren't there
nonaquatic pollywogs?

22:11.204 --> 22:14.374
Terrestrial pollywogs?
Yep. Two to be exact.

22:14.458 --> 22:15.917
Indirana semipalmata.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.670
And the Adenomera andreae.

22:18.754 --> 22:21.173
One's from India,
one's from South America.

22:21.256 --> 22:22.966
So how did one end up in my trash?

22:23.050 --> 22:25.510
Maybe some scientists brought it here,
and it escaped?

22:25.594 --> 22:26.928
Do you guys see that?

22:27.012 --> 22:29.347
Looks like something
is moving inside of it.

22:36.521 --> 22:37.689
Whoa.

22:37.773 --> 22:38.899
It's okay. It's okay.

22:38.982 --> 22:41.151
I got you, little guy.

22:41.234 --> 22:43.904
I know you don't like that. It's okay.

22:43.987 --> 22:45.197
And there's another thing.

22:45.280 --> 22:47.908
Reptiles, they're cold-blooded.
Ectothermic, right?

22:47.991 --> 22:51.244
They love heat, the sun.
Dart hates it. It hurts him.

22:51.328 --> 22:54.039
So, if he's not a pollywog or a reptile...

22:54.122 --> 22:56.083
Then I've discovered a new species.

23:13.725 --> 23:15.102
We gotta show him to Mr. Clarke.

23:15.185 --> 23:17.955
- What if he steals my discovery?
- He's not gonna steal your discovery.

23:17.979 --> 23:20.899
You know, I'm thinking about calling it
Dustonious pollywogus.

23:20.982 --> 23:23.151
- What do you think?
- I think you're an idiot.

23:23.235 --> 23:25.075
When I become
rich and famous for this one day,

23:25.153 --> 23:26.473
don't come crawling back, saying,

23:26.530 --> 23:29.450
"Oh, my God, Dustin, I'm so sorry
for being mean to you back in 8th grade.

23:29.491 --> 23:30.491
Oh, my God."

23:38.083 --> 23:39.501
- Have a nice day.
- Thank you.

23:41.461 --> 23:42.461
Baloney?

23:43.505 --> 23:44.798
Mmm.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.802
- Last night was fun.
- Mmm-hmm.

23:49.886 --> 23:52.347
I'm sorry if I overstepped anything.

23:52.430 --> 23:54.599
No! No, you didn't.

23:55.976 --> 23:56.976
Okay.

23:57.894 --> 23:58.895
I mean...

23:59.813 --> 24:01.690
I... I like you so much.

24:02.816 --> 24:05.610
Not just you,
everything that comes with you.

24:06.278 --> 24:07.487
Your family, your boys.

24:08.238 --> 24:09.958
And I hope it's not
wishful thinking, but...

24:10.574 --> 24:12.659
I kinda feel like
I'm breaking through with them.

24:12.742 --> 24:15.078
Not so much Jonathan.
He's a tough cookie to crack, but...

24:15.162 --> 24:16.079
Yeah.

24:16.163 --> 24:20.041
With Will, I don't know,
I feel like we're connecting.

24:20.125 --> 24:21.459
He likes you, too.

24:21.543 --> 24:22.794
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

24:22.878 --> 24:24.171
I can tell.

24:24.254 --> 24:25.255
Good.

24:27.591 --> 24:30.844
Oh, there was...
something else I was gonna mention, but...

24:31.428 --> 24:33.180
It's not a big deal at all, but...

24:34.097 --> 24:37.559
I just noticed this morning that my JVC
was a little dinged up.

24:38.351 --> 24:40.854
- Your what?
- The video camera.

24:41.813 --> 24:42.939
- Oh.
- Yeah.

24:43.023 --> 24:45.150
It still works fine and everything.
I just...

24:45.233 --> 24:47.027
I went back and watched the tape...

24:47.694 --> 24:51.031
and there were some older kids
picking on Will.

24:51.573 --> 24:53.325
- What?
- They scared him.

24:53.408 --> 24:56.036
Who were they?
Were they the Zimmerman brothers again?

24:56.119 --> 24:57.329
Um, I don't know.

24:57.412 --> 24:59.292
They were wearing masks
or sort of makeup and...

24:59.372 --> 25:00.832
Maybe. They were the right age.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.334
I'll kill them.

25:02.417 --> 25:05.503
I swear to God, I will...
I will kill them.

25:05.587 --> 25:08.089
That's what I love about you.
You punch back.

25:09.174 --> 25:12.385
I was never really one
to put up a fight.

25:14.387 --> 25:16.598
I struggled a lot like Will
when I was a kid.

25:17.182 --> 25:18.225
With bullies.

25:18.308 --> 25:21.478
It's the ones like us,
that don't punch back,

25:21.561 --> 25:23.521
that people really take
advantage of, you know?

25:23.605 --> 25:26.024
They rub your nose in it,
just a little bit more.

25:27.901 --> 25:29.277
I don't know why they do that.

25:31.655 --> 25:34.366
Maybe it makes them feel powerful.

25:36.117 --> 25:37.577
I don't know.

25:37.661 --> 25:40.330
But, hey, look at me now.

25:41.122 --> 25:43.333
I get to date Joyce Byers. Ha!

25:43.416 --> 25:46.044
Are you kidding me? I get to date...

25:46.962 --> 25:48.588
It all works out in the end,
doesn't it?

25:48.672 --> 25:50.006
Yes, it does.

25:59.182 --> 26:01.017
Grass, crops, trees.

26:01.101 --> 26:03.478
Everything in this area
is either dead or dying,

26:03.561 --> 26:05.772
and that's a radius of over three miles.

26:05.855 --> 26:07.565
And it all leads back to here.

26:08.149 --> 26:12.487
See, these patterns here
are really pretty. I like the design.

26:13.071 --> 26:14.489
It's almost psychedelic.

26:15.448 --> 26:18.243
- This is a joke to you, huh?
- No, it's not a joke. I just...

26:18.326 --> 26:20.829
I don't understand what this
has to do with me, Chief Hopper.

26:20.912 --> 26:25.125
Whatever is happening is spreading
from this place, from this lab.

26:25.208 --> 26:29.129
That's impossible. It's...
The last burn was two days ago.

26:29.212 --> 26:30.505
It's contained.

26:30.588 --> 26:33.550
- What if there's a leak?
- A leak?

26:33.633 --> 26:36.344
- I don't know, man. You're the scientist.
- Exactly.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.888
And I'm telling you
there's nothing to worry about.

26:39.514 --> 26:40.674
- Convince me.
- Convince you?

26:40.724 --> 26:44.060
Yeah. You and your egghead friends

26:44.144 --> 26:47.605
go out there to every area on this map
and you run your tests,

26:47.689 --> 26:51.526
or whatever the hell it is you do,
and you see if anything comes up.

26:52.152 --> 26:53.737
All right, so...

26:53.820 --> 26:56.281
So you're... you're giving me orders now?

26:57.157 --> 26:58.157
No.

26:58.867 --> 27:00.952
- I keep things nice and quiet for you...
- Mmm-hmm.

27:01.036 --> 27:04.414
...and you keep your shit out of my town.

27:04.497 --> 27:05.790
That is the deal.

27:05.874 --> 27:08.960
I have done my part, now you do yours.

27:13.423 --> 27:14.758
Convince me.

27:16.760 --> 27:19.387
So, he asked you to take me home?

27:20.096 --> 27:21.096
Yeah.

27:21.556 --> 27:23.058
Yeah, he was upset.

27:23.141 --> 27:25.685
I mean, he was... He was really upset.

27:28.605 --> 27:30.357
But he was still worried about you.

27:32.901 --> 27:33.901
Hey.

27:33.943 --> 27:36.321
You need to cut yourself some slack, okay?

27:36.988 --> 27:39.449
People say stupid things
when they're wasted.

27:39.532 --> 27:40.784
Things they don't mean.

27:40.867 --> 27:42.369
Yeah, but that's the thing.

27:43.286 --> 27:44.454
What if I did mean it?

27:44.537 --> 27:48.917
All this time, I've been trying
so hard to pretend like everything's fine,

27:49.000 --> 27:51.002
but it's not.

27:51.086 --> 27:53.797
I... I feel like there's this...

27:54.756 --> 27:56.549
I don't know, like this...

27:56.633 --> 27:59.427
Like there's this weight
you're carrying around with you.

28:00.345 --> 28:01.721
All the time.

28:01.805 --> 28:02.972
I feel it, too.

28:04.057 --> 28:05.475
Yeah, but it's different for you.

28:06.309 --> 28:07.310
Will came home.

28:07.394 --> 28:08.394
Yeah.

28:08.937 --> 28:09.938
Yeah, he did.

28:10.688 --> 28:12.607
But he's not the same.

28:13.566 --> 28:17.153
I try to be there for him,
you know, to help him, but...

28:17.237 --> 28:19.948
I don't know.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.326
I mean, maybe...

28:24.786 --> 28:27.580
maybe things just can't go back
to the way they were.

28:29.624 --> 28:31.167
Doesn't that make you mad?

28:32.085 --> 28:32.961
Mad?

28:33.044 --> 28:36.005
Yeah, that those...
those people who did this,

28:36.089 --> 28:39.008
who ruined so many lives,
they just get away with it.

28:39.092 --> 28:41.010
The people responsible for this...

28:41.761 --> 28:43.596
- they're dead.
- Do you really believe that?

28:55.358 --> 28:56.484
Your mom's boyfriend.

28:57.318 --> 28:59.738
- He works at RadioShack, right?
- Yeah.

29:00.989 --> 29:01.989
Why?

29:04.117 --> 29:05.285
What are you thinking?

29:07.078 --> 29:09.289
Do you wanna skip fourth period?

29:09.372 --> 29:12.500
Isn't this fun?

29:30.643 --> 29:32.687
Pump your feet.

29:36.441 --> 29:39.694
"I would feel so sad if I thought
I was a disappointment to her...

29:39.778 --> 29:42.405
because she didn't live
very long after that, you see.

29:42.489 --> 29:45.867
She died of a fever
when I was just three months old.

29:46.701 --> 29:50.663
I do wish she'd lived long enough for me
to remember calling her mother.

29:50.747 --> 29:52.582
I think it would be so sweet
to say 'mother.'"

29:52.665 --> 29:54.334
Do I have a mother?

29:55.502 --> 29:57.170
Yeah, of course you have a mother.

29:57.837 --> 29:59.756
You couldn't really be born without one.

30:01.549 --> 30:03.092
Where is she?

30:03.176 --> 30:04.344
She...

30:07.013 --> 30:08.973
She's not around anymore.

30:10.600 --> 30:11.600
Gone?

30:13.019 --> 30:14.019
Yeah.

30:19.609 --> 30:21.277
I'm sorry about that, kid.

30:29.494 --> 30:33.081
"And, uh, father died
four days afterwards from fever, too.

30:33.164 --> 30:35.542
That left me an orphan
and folks were at their wits' end,

30:35.625 --> 30:38.586
so Mrs. Thomas said to me,
what to do with me.

30:38.670 --> 30:41.214
You see, nobody wanted me even then.

30:41.297 --> 30:43.049
It seems to be my fate."

30:43.758 --> 30:45.051
Is your mom here?

30:45.969 --> 30:46.970
Sweetie?

30:49.681 --> 30:50.682
School.

30:52.517 --> 30:54.310
Where is school?

30:54.394 --> 30:57.730
The school? It's, uh...
it's about a mile that way.

30:58.398 --> 30:59.398
At least.

31:00.358 --> 31:01.568
Where are your parents?

31:05.280 --> 31:07.115
Look, Mommy, look.

31:46.905 --> 31:49.532
RadioShack, Bob Newby speaking.
How can I help ya?

31:50.116 --> 31:51.242
Bob, it's Joyce.

31:51.326 --> 31:52.827
Hey, Joyce, how ya doing?

31:52.911 --> 31:55.830
Hey, um... I'm trying
to watch your video thingy,

31:55.914 --> 31:59.375
and the tape, it's... it's tiny.
It's like it's shrunk.

31:59.459 --> 32:02.253
That's 'cause it's a VHS-C,
not a VHS.

32:02.337 --> 32:04.881
You gotta find the RF-P1U
with coaxial cable

32:04.964 --> 32:07.008
so you can connect the video ins and outs.

32:07.091 --> 32:08.843
Bob, English.

32:08.927 --> 32:10.887
Right. Sorry. Um...

32:12.597 --> 32:16.184
No, yeah, I did the coaxial things
in the back, so I...

32:16.267 --> 32:18.728
This one just goes into the camera itself?

32:18.811 --> 32:21.940
- Yeah. Yeah, exactly.
- It's blue. I think it's working.

32:22.023 --> 32:23.250
I was thinking maybe tonight...

32:23.274 --> 32:24.734
Joyce?

32:28.237 --> 32:32.158
So you hit T to zoom in,
and W zooms back out.

32:32.241 --> 32:33.534
See? Easy-peasy.

32:59.602 --> 33:01.396
Watch it, zombie boy.

33:01.479 --> 33:03.147
Trick or treat, freak.

33:04.148 --> 33:05.149
Boo!

33:05.233 --> 33:08.111
Loser.

33:08.194 --> 33:10.989
Mike! Mike!

34:06.711 --> 34:09.380
Will, you coming?
Let's go show Mr. Clarke.

34:10.882 --> 34:11.882
What?

34:12.467 --> 34:13.760
What?

34:14.385 --> 34:15.803
It's about d'Artagnan.

34:15.887 --> 34:18.473
This is the reason I was late for class.

34:19.389 --> 34:21.059
Pretty neat. These doors function?

34:21.141 --> 34:23.518
Well, yeah, obviously.
But it's not about the trap.

34:23.603 --> 34:24.812
It's what's inside.

34:24.896 --> 34:27.940
Now, this very well may change
your perception of the world.

34:28.024 --> 34:29.143
Consider my interest piqued.

34:29.192 --> 34:32.320
All right, first,
let's just clarify that...

34:32.402 --> 34:34.655
this is my discovery, not yours.

34:34.739 --> 34:36.074
Dustin, Jesus! Just show him!

34:36.157 --> 34:37.757
- I'm just trying to clarify...
- Dustin!

34:37.824 --> 34:38.993
Okay, fine.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.078
Stop!

34:40.161 --> 34:42.205
I'm sorry, Mr. Clarke.
It was just a stupid prank.

34:42.288 --> 34:44.516
- What are you doing?
- I told him to stop. We need to go.

34:44.540 --> 34:46.375
- Mike!
- Right now. Right now!

34:50.755 --> 34:52.799
So, your sister coming or what?

34:54.007 --> 34:56.344
Screw it. That little shit can skate home.

34:58.012 --> 34:59.931
- And don't call her that.
- What?

35:00.014 --> 35:02.183
Sister. She's not my sister.

35:14.529 --> 35:16.447
Hello? Hello?

35:16.531 --> 35:18.783
- Guys, come on. Can I come in yet?
- No!

35:19.450 --> 35:22.161
- I don't understand.
- What do you not understand?

35:22.245 --> 35:25.081
Will saw something
that looked like Dart last year?

35:25.164 --> 35:27.125
Kind of, but there was no tail.

35:27.208 --> 35:29.293
But then he heard it yesterday.
The exact same sound.

35:29.377 --> 35:31.420
- Why didn't you tell us before?
- I wasn't sure.

35:31.504 --> 35:32.797
- A coincidence.
- Or not.

35:32.880 --> 35:34.757
What if when Will was stuck
in the Upside Down,

35:34.841 --> 35:36.425
he somehow acquired True Sight?

35:36.509 --> 35:37.426
True Sight?

35:37.510 --> 35:39.679
It gives you the power
to see into the ethereal plane.

35:39.762 --> 35:41.389
Elaborate.

35:41.472 --> 35:44.934
Maybe these episodes that Will keeps
having aren't really flashbacks at all.

35:45.017 --> 35:46.269
Maybe they're real.

35:46.352 --> 35:48.688
Maybe Will can somehow see
into the Upside Down.

35:48.771 --> 35:51.274
- So that would mean...
- Dart is from the Upside Down.

35:51.357 --> 35:53.776
- We have to take him to Hopper.
- I agree.

35:53.860 --> 35:56.028
No way. If we take him to Hopper,
Dart's good as dead.

35:56.112 --> 35:57.947
- Maybe he should be.
- How can you say that?

35:58.030 --> 35:59.710
How can you not?
He's from the Upside Down.

35:59.782 --> 36:02.618
Maybe. But even if he is, it doesn't
automatically mean that he's bad.

36:02.702 --> 36:05.102
That's like saying just because
someone's from the Death Star

36:05.163 --> 36:06.803
- doesn't make them bad.
- We have a bond.

36:06.873 --> 36:09.333
A bond? Just because he likes nougat?

36:09.417 --> 36:10.585
No, because he trusts me!

36:10.668 --> 36:11.961
He trusts you?

36:12.044 --> 36:13.713
Yes, I promised
I would take care of him.

36:18.134 --> 36:20.219
Guys, what's going on? Come on.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.709
- Don't hurt him.
- Only if he attacks.

36:33.733 --> 36:35.151
Just open it already.

36:41.240 --> 36:43.075
Holy shit!

36:50.458 --> 36:51.792
Oh, shit!

36:52.293 --> 36:53.336
No!

36:59.467 --> 37:00.467
What the...

37:01.302 --> 37:02.345
Oh, shit!

37:04.096 --> 37:05.139
Where'd he go?

37:05.223 --> 37:06.307
- What was that?
- Dart!

37:06.390 --> 37:07.850
- What?
- You let him escape!

37:07.934 --> 37:09.894
- Why did you attack him?
- Come on.

37:09.977 --> 37:12.146
Don't hurt him. Don't you hurt him!

37:19.111 --> 37:20.446
Jonathan?

37:21.280 --> 37:22.531
Uh... Mrs. Wheeler.

37:22.615 --> 37:24.659
- What a pleasant surprise.
- Yeah.

37:25.660 --> 37:27.912
- Uh, we have a test tomorrow.
- Hmm.

37:28.537 --> 37:32.375
- Oh, did you go shopping?
- Oh, uh, yeah. My Walkman broke.

37:32.458 --> 37:33.876
- Aw!
- Bummer.

37:33.960 --> 37:35.720
Anyway, we should go.
It's a really big test.

37:35.795 --> 37:37.129
- Yeah.
- So...

37:37.213 --> 37:38.673
- Stressful.
- Very.

37:39.423 --> 37:42.009
- Bye, Mrs. Wheeler.
- Bye! It's good to see you.

37:42.593 --> 37:45.388
Okay, are you sure about this?

37:45.471 --> 37:46.471
No.

37:58.150 --> 37:59.527
Hello. Marsha speaking.

38:00.361 --> 38:01.361
Hello?

38:02.071 --> 38:03.114
Hello?

38:03.197 --> 38:07.326
Mrs. Holland. Hi, it's, um... it's Nancy.

38:07.910 --> 38:08.953
Nancy?

38:09.036 --> 38:10.036
I, uh...

38:10.705 --> 38:14.750
I need to tell you something.
Something about Barb.

38:15.334 --> 38:16.919
About that night. I, uh...

38:17.503 --> 38:19.797
I, uh... I haven't been honest with you.

38:22.216 --> 38:24.593
But I can't tell you here on the phone.

38:25.052 --> 38:27.847
Meet me tomorrow,
Forrest Hills Park, 9:00 a.m.

38:27.930 --> 38:29.056
Don't tell anyone.

38:29.140 --> 38:31.517
And don't call me back here.
It's dangerous.

38:31.600 --> 38:32.935
Nancy, what is this?

38:33.019 --> 38:35.354
I just need you
to trust me. Please.

38:49.952 --> 38:52.079
Well, you were right
about these pumpkins.

38:52.163 --> 38:53.873
Some nasty stuff.

38:53.956 --> 38:56.083
And the smell...
Gee, mother of God.

38:56.167 --> 38:57.727
What exactly do you think
is going on...

38:57.793 --> 38:59.962
Well, I told you what I think.

39:00.046 --> 39:02.715
But we'll run the tests,
and we'll see what comes up.

39:03.382 --> 39:06.385
In the meantime, I just need you
to keep the area clear for us.

39:06.469 --> 39:08.429
I don't think it'll be
more than a day or two.

39:08.512 --> 39:10.264
What do you want me to tell people?

39:11.432 --> 39:13.351
I'm sure you'll figure something out.

39:14.894 --> 39:17.355
- Hey, Chief, you copy?
- Yeah.

39:17.438 --> 39:21.067
Do you remember that Russian girl
Murray was going on about the other day?

39:21.942 --> 39:24.612
Yeah, well, now I'm thinking
he's not so crazy after all.

39:26.697 --> 39:29.283
Stay where you are. Do not move.

40:17.498 --> 40:19.458
East is clear. No sign of Dart.

40:22.461 --> 40:24.547
Where'd you go, you little bastard?

40:46.193 --> 40:48.154
West is clear, too. Will?

40:49.029 --> 40:50.531
South is clear. Lucas?

40:51.073 --> 40:52.073
Anything?

40:53.659 --> 40:55.953
Excuse me! Mr. Sinclair!

40:56.036 --> 40:58.664
Sorry,
I was looking for study hall.

40:58.747 --> 40:59.747
Bye.

41:00.291 --> 41:01.291
Nothing here, man.

41:50.299 --> 41:52.843
- What the hell are you doing?
- What are you doing?

41:52.927 --> 41:54.529
- Why are you in here?
- Looking for Dart.

41:54.553 --> 41:55.993
- This is the boys' room.
- Yeah, so?

41:56.055 --> 41:57.598
So you should go home.

42:00.768 --> 42:02.811
- Why do you hate me so much?
- I don't hate you.

42:02.895 --> 42:05.916
- How can I hate you? I don't know you.
- But you don't want me in your party.

42:05.940 --> 42:06.940
- Correct.
- Why not?

42:06.982 --> 42:10.069
Because you're annoying.
Also, we don't need another party member.

42:10.152 --> 42:14.114
I'm our paladin, Will's our cleric,
Dustin's our bard, Lucas is our ranger,

42:14.198 --> 42:15.616
and El is our mage.

42:15.699 --> 42:18.869
- El? Who's El?
- Someone. No one.

42:18.953 --> 42:20.120
Someone or no one?

42:20.204 --> 42:23.457
She was in our party a long time ago.
She moved away, okay?

42:24.792 --> 42:25.918
She was a mage?

42:27.169 --> 42:29.547
Well, what could she do?
Like, magic tricks or something?

42:29.630 --> 42:31.423
Well, I could be your zoomer.

42:31.507 --> 42:33.842
- That's not even a real thing.
- It could be.

42:35.928 --> 42:38.097
- See? Zoomer.
- Mind-blowing.

42:38.180 --> 42:39.974
Come on, you know you're impressed.

42:42.935 --> 42:45.615
I don't see any tricks.
You're just going around in a circle.

42:45.688 --> 42:47.690
If it's so easy, you try it.

42:47.773 --> 42:49.316
- No.
- Why not?

42:49.400 --> 42:50.442
I don't know how.

42:50.526 --> 42:52.653
So, then you admit
it's kind of impressive.

42:52.736 --> 42:55.864
I think if I spent, like,
all day practicing, I could do that.

42:55.948 --> 42:58.576
I would give you a million bucks
if you could.

42:59.159 --> 43:00.703
Okay, you're making me dizzy.

43:00.786 --> 43:03.247
- Please just stop.
- I'll stop when I join your party.

43:03.330 --> 43:06.959
- Come on, just stop.
- It's a simple question. Am I in or out?

43:19.763 --> 43:21.682
Jesus! Are you all right?

43:21.765 --> 43:23.809
Yeah, yeah. I think so.

43:24.518 --> 43:26.312
- What happened?
- I don't know.

43:26.395 --> 43:29.189
It was like a magnet or something
pulling on my board.

43:29.273 --> 43:30.566
I know that sounds crazy.

43:47.124 --> 43:50.586
Come on, come on, come on!

43:57.718 --> 43:59.762
Hawkins Middle. May I help you?

43:59.845 --> 44:01.513
Yes. Hi, Doris. It's Joyce.

44:01.597 --> 44:03.223
- Uh, Joyce Byers.
- Joyce.

44:03.307 --> 44:06.935
Uh, Will has AV Club today.
Could you transfer me to Mr. Clarke?

44:07.019 --> 44:09.563
- Mr. Clarke? Huh. You know what?
- What?

44:09.647 --> 44:12.733
I just saw him leave for the day.
Maybe AV was canceled?

44:12.816 --> 44:14.652
- What?
- Would you like me to...

44:56.110 --> 44:57.111
Guys...

44:58.028 --> 45:00.280
- I found him.
- Where?

45:02.116 --> 45:04.743
In the bathroom by Mr. Salerno's.

45:04.827 --> 45:05.869
Copy that.

45:08.497 --> 45:09.497
It's okay.

45:09.998 --> 45:11.750
I'm not gonna hurt you.

46:02.885 --> 46:04.052
Hey, buddy.

46:05.345 --> 46:08.724
Come here. You know I won't hurt you.

46:09.808 --> 46:11.935
It's okay. It's just me.

46:13.061 --> 46:14.062
You're okay.

46:14.146 --> 46:16.315
- Let's go. Down here.
- We're coming!

46:19.109 --> 46:21.820
Stay low. Keep quiet.

46:24.198 --> 46:25.324
Where's Dart?

46:25.407 --> 46:27.201
- I don't know. Not here.
- What?

46:27.284 --> 46:30.704
- He said by Salerno's, right?
- Yeah, maybe Will has him.

46:32.414 --> 46:33.499
Where is Will?

46:40.714 --> 46:43.717
Only this time, I didn't run.

46:49.890 --> 46:52.726
This time, I stood my ground.

47:05.989 --> 47:08.408
I said, "Go away. Go away!"

47:09.326 --> 47:11.286
Go away!

47:15.541 --> 47:17.501
Go away!

47:18.752 --> 47:20.587
Go away!

47:21.004 --> 47:24.633
Go away! Go away!

47:25.217 --> 47:27.845
Go away!

47:37.020 --> 47:38.272
Easy-peasy, right?

47:40.691 --> 47:41.942
Easy-peasy.

47:44.027 --> 47:45.862
Just like that.
