00:08.279 --> 00:09.589
(Episode 3)

00:36.549 --> 00:39.149
Is this all over now?

00:40.119 --> 00:43.149
By any chance, is there\Nanything else I should do?

00:44.450 --> 00:45.950
I've never\Ndone this before.

01:26.830 --> 01:28.059
Constable Lee.

01:28.500 --> 01:29.899
Why are you calling me\Nat this hour?

01:33.240 --> 01:34.440
What? Detective Ha?

01:53.690 --> 01:54.690
Ms. Yoo.

01:56.059 --> 01:57.229
Constable Lee.

01:58.360 --> 01:59.630
What happened?

02:00.059 --> 02:01.600
He jumped\Nout of a window...

02:01.600 --> 02:03.100
and hurt his ankle.

02:03.199 --> 02:05.729
I called you because\Nhe might need your help.

02:05.770 --> 02:07.699
How's Detective Ha?\NIs he okay?

02:07.699 --> 02:09.369
Did he get hurt?\NIs he all right?

02:09.940 --> 02:10.940
He's over there.

02:29.059 --> 02:31.390
That's strange.\NHe was right there.

02:33.330 --> 02:34.460
What are you looking at?

02:35.460 --> 02:36.999
Gosh, you scared me.

02:38.170 --> 02:39.230
Are you okay?

02:39.999 --> 02:41.240
This won't kill me.

02:43.640 --> 02:44.839
What's with those shoes?

02:47.439 --> 02:48.540
They're comfy.

02:48.779 --> 02:50.809
Did you run over here\Nbecause you were worried?

02:51.010 --> 02:52.510
Of course I ran.

02:52.809 --> 02:55.849
I always wanted to solve\Nan arson case.

02:55.849 --> 02:57.950
I almost died back there.\NHow can you say that?

02:57.950 --> 03:00.559
You said it wasn't bad\Nenough to get killed.

03:08.929 --> 03:11.070
Gosh, you look so pitiful.

03:11.070 --> 03:12.939
Why don't you eat\Nat a restaurant?

03:12.939 --> 03:14.800
It's too late\Nto go to one.

03:17.469 --> 03:18.809
I shouldn't eat in here,\Nright?

03:19.040 --> 03:20.540
This is good.\NI'll go get another one.

03:25.480 --> 03:27.379
Did he really place first\Nin Police University?

03:28.279 --> 03:30.189
He never gets credit\Nfor what he does.

03:30.320 --> 03:31.649
He gets hit and hurt.

03:32.089 --> 03:33.520
Now it's fire.

03:35.460 --> 03:36.659
What a dummy.

03:38.490 --> 03:42.230
(Queen of Mystery 2)

03:53.439 --> 03:54.740
The arsonists\Nhas been caught?

03:54.740 --> 03:57.179
Yes, we're ready\Nfor a briefing.

03:57.179 --> 03:58.210
Let's go in.

03:59.050 --> 04:00.480
Name. Na Jin Tae.

04:01.420 --> 04:02.480
32 years old.

04:02.480 --> 04:04.520
Construction worker\Nin Baebang-dong site.

04:04.520 --> 04:05.520
At 17,

04:05.520 --> 04:06.589
he was expelled...

04:06.589 --> 04:07.790
for setting fire\Nto the high school gym.

04:07.790 --> 04:10.029
At 29, he was fined\Nand fired from his job...

04:10.029 --> 04:11.429
for distributing\Nillegal videos.

04:11.429 --> 04:12.529
Manager Jo.

04:12.899 --> 04:15.260
- Yes, sir.\N- He produced videos...

04:15.260 --> 04:16.800
Where is Wan Seung?

04:18.599 --> 04:20.999
He's really busy\Ntrying to take care of...

04:20.999 --> 04:22.339
an urgent business.

04:24.409 --> 04:26.339
I'm happy\Nhe's out of my sight.

04:27.779 --> 04:29.539
You won't have to worry\Nabout him.

04:30.909 --> 04:32.549
- Goodness.\N- My gosh.

04:32.549 --> 04:34.180
- Look at that.\N- Gosh.

04:34.779 --> 04:36.390
This is terrible.

04:36.989 --> 04:39.190
Why did the fire\Nbreak out?

04:39.190 --> 04:40.320
What happened?

04:40.320 --> 04:42.289
Was it just\Nthe second floor?

04:44.060 --> 04:45.529
You can't go in there.

04:45.930 --> 04:47.029
This is my house.

04:48.060 --> 04:49.260
I'm with him.

05:12.190 --> 05:13.320
Seo Hyun Soo.

05:14.919 --> 05:16.190
Seo Hyun Soo.

05:34.710 --> 05:35.839
Why do you look so shabby?

05:36.950 --> 05:39.680
I went to the scene\Nto find some clues.

05:40.820 --> 05:45.450
It looks like\Nyou've crawled all night.

05:46.289 --> 05:47.690
Did you find anything?

05:47.890 --> 05:49.289
She's completely burnt,

05:49.419 --> 05:51.190
so it's hard to get\Nfingerprints.

05:51.560 --> 05:52.589
Gosh.

05:53.229 --> 05:55.729
This is going to\Ntake time.

05:56.159 --> 05:59.640
Anyway, why are you\Nlooking for burnt bodies?

06:59.060 --> 07:01.760
There is no memo pad,\Nbut only a pen.

07:03.430 --> 07:04.870
You said you were from\Nthe headquarters.

07:05.229 --> 07:06.669
But I didn't get\Nany calls.

07:07.899 --> 07:10.469
I stopped by\Nbecause I was in the area.

07:10.469 --> 07:13.140
I'll stay here\Nfor a while.

07:13.779 --> 07:14.880
You take care.

07:15.180 --> 07:16.779
Okay, sir.

07:29.089 --> 07:30.289
Mr. Kim.

07:31.989 --> 07:33.200
Mr. Kim?

07:33.729 --> 07:35.399
I heard you've been\Nlooking for me.

07:35.659 --> 07:36.770
Who is this?

07:37.270 --> 07:38.669
I'm Hyun Soo.

07:39.469 --> 07:40.599
Seo Hyun Soo.

07:41.700 --> 07:43.239
Seo Hyun Soo.

07:45.239 --> 07:46.440
Can you\Nfigure something out?

07:49.710 --> 07:52.479
Fire is such\Na specialized field.

07:52.479 --> 07:55.279
I thought you were\NMs. Know-it-all.

07:58.020 --> 07:59.489
It's so wet.

08:08.359 --> 08:09.500
All right.

08:13.239 --> 08:15.599
Lady. Come here.

08:19.440 --> 08:20.580
Wear these.

08:21.109 --> 08:22.380
I'm okay.

08:22.739 --> 08:24.849
You'll catch a cold\Nif your shoes are wet.

08:25.649 --> 08:27.080
Don't mind me.

08:27.380 --> 08:28.919
I don't want to\Ncatch a cold from you.

08:30.349 --> 08:32.549
I don't think I can run\Nin these.

08:32.549 --> 08:35.159
Why do you always\Nthink of running?

08:39.559 --> 08:40.960
Your socks are all wet.

09:01.249 --> 09:03.089
I'm alive and well.

09:03.089 --> 09:04.489
Go and study for the exam.

09:04.489 --> 09:06.420
I don't want you\Nto blame me for failing.

09:06.420 --> 09:07.920
I have to catch\Nthe arsonist.

09:09.560 --> 09:12.560
Right. You wouldn't leave\Njust because I told you.

09:13.460 --> 09:16.200
Wrap everything up\Nwithout any hiccups.

09:17.300 --> 09:19.599
Yes, sir.\NDon't worry, sir.

09:31.509 --> 09:33.580
You didn't even unpack.

09:34.050 --> 09:35.680
The boxes are burnt,\Nbut not what's inside.

09:37.820 --> 09:39.519
The gas hasn't been\Ninstalled yet.

09:39.920 --> 09:41.460
No electric heating\Nappliances either.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.290
You said you grew up\Nwealthy.

09:44.290 --> 09:45.660
What's with this\Nshabby place?

09:46.259 --> 09:48.759
I thought you were moving\Nto a really nice place.

09:50.030 --> 09:51.030
Anyway,

09:51.400 --> 09:53.639
the fire didn't start in\Nthe room or the kitchen.

09:53.769 --> 09:55.839
Did someone start\Nthe fire outside then?

09:56.139 --> 09:59.310
Did you ever upset anyone?

10:01.009 --> 10:02.339
There's a lot, right?

10:03.680 --> 10:06.009
There must be since\NI'm a police officer.

10:06.619 --> 10:09.920
It can't be suspicious.\NIt has to look natural.

10:11.119 --> 10:13.389
Accident\Nor natural disaster.

10:14.359 --> 10:16.389
Fire wouldn't be bad\Neither.

10:16.830 --> 10:19.999
Is it necessary to kill?

10:20.099 --> 10:22.200
If not, it'll be\Na source of trouble.

10:23.099 --> 10:24.499
I've been through this.

10:24.999 --> 10:26.739
You don't want to\Nprune a tree,

10:31.940 --> 10:33.479
and end up with no fruit.

10:34.180 --> 10:36.180
It's necessary\Nfor the good of the whole.

10:36.410 --> 10:38.150
- But...\N- Mr. Gye.

10:38.609 --> 10:40.619
Have you developed\Nsome kind of affection?

10:41.320 --> 10:44.349
You're more sentimental\Nthan you look.

10:51.160 --> 10:53.900
Arsonists usually show up\Nat the scene of the crime.

10:53.900 --> 10:55.830
They get excited\Nand put out the fire,

10:55.999 --> 10:57.800
or they help out\Nat the scene.

10:58.030 --> 11:00.739
Did you see\Nanyone suspicious?

11:03.540 --> 11:04.670
Hey, come over here.

11:06.609 --> 11:07.910
Did you see\Nanyone suspicious?

11:07.910 --> 11:09.650
Anyone who was helping\Nto put out the fire...

11:09.650 --> 11:10.810
or someone who stood out?

11:10.950 --> 11:13.249
Well... That man.

11:13.719 --> 11:14.719
- Gosh.\N- Gosh, no.

11:14.719 --> 11:16.989
- We need to...\N- Shouldn't we go in?

11:16.989 --> 11:19.349
Gosh, we need to preserve\Nthe scene.

11:19.690 --> 11:20.759
You can't go in.

11:21.359 --> 11:22.420
Hey, Constable Lee.

11:23.060 --> 11:24.060
Gosh, yes?

11:24.259 --> 11:25.259
Why are you still here?

11:25.989 --> 11:27.099
I was worried.

11:27.099 --> 11:29.259
I was also checking if\Nthere's anyone suspicious.

11:29.259 --> 11:30.769
The way I see it, you're\Nmost suspicious.

11:31.430 --> 11:33.239
Go in and rest.

11:33.239 --> 11:34.239
Okay, sir.

11:42.379 --> 11:44.379
Should I really kill him?

11:44.780 --> 11:46.479
You just said\Nyou have to kill him.

11:48.479 --> 11:49.820
When he was six,

11:50.889 --> 11:53.660
he lost his parents and\Nlived with his relatives.

11:55.460 --> 11:58.129
He finally met\Nhis true love.

11:58.190 --> 12:01.160
He finally learned what\Nhappiness is about.

12:04.499 --> 12:05.499
Mr. Gye.

12:06.670 --> 12:07.800
Will you really...

12:07.800 --> 12:08.940
Then...

12:10.210 --> 12:12.839
let's make him pass\Na deadly crisis...

12:13.109 --> 12:16.379
and reunite with\Nthe main character.

12:16.410 --> 12:18.879
Can I really do that?

12:21.150 --> 12:23.650
(Office of\NCriminal Affairs Manager)

12:23.650 --> 12:24.719
Goodbye, sir.

12:29.290 --> 12:30.759
Gosh, I'm dizzy.

12:31.190 --> 12:34.729
I should write that darn\Nnovel myself or something.

12:37.070 --> 12:38.129
Mr. Gye.

12:39.099 --> 12:40.239
Hi, Sergeant Yuk.

12:40.499 --> 12:42.269
I brought Na Jin Tae in\Nthe interrogation room.

12:42.269 --> 12:43.269
What do you want me\Nto do with him?

12:44.009 --> 12:45.570
Make him confess by\Ntoday and close the case.

12:46.509 --> 12:47.509
Oh, right.

12:48.479 --> 12:50.849
How is Ha Wan Seung?

12:51.710 --> 12:53.119
I heard his house\Ncaught on fire.

13:23.879 --> 13:26.349
(Wumyung)

13:31.019 --> 13:32.349
(Lime)

13:32.849 --> 13:34.089
"Wumyung Lime".

13:38.460 --> 13:42.859
(Wumyung Lime)

13:44.499 --> 13:45.729
Let alone any anchor,

13:46.070 --> 13:47.670
there isn't any pot\Naround here.

13:49.269 --> 13:50.839
Do you raise chickens\Nby any chance?

13:50.839 --> 13:52.040
Chickens, my foot.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.940
Then why did you\Nbuy quicklime...

13:53.940 --> 13:55.180
from Wumyung Lime?

13:55.879 --> 13:57.009
It's mostly used for...

13:57.009 --> 13:58.550
disinfecting chicken\Nfarms or as fertilizer.

13:58.550 --> 14:00.080
Why would I buy\Nsuch a thing?

14:03.320 --> 14:04.950
- Lime...\N- Polystyrene may...

14:04.950 --> 14:06.859
catch on fire\Nif it's near lime.

14:08.489 --> 14:09.489
Quicklime?

14:22.469 --> 14:23.540
It's Na Jin Tae's doing.

14:34.920 --> 14:36.790
Is he the Arbiter of Fire?

14:37.550 --> 14:39.450
He didn't get caught...

14:39.450 --> 14:40.619
after committing arson\Nfor more than 34 times.

14:41.460 --> 14:44.030
So I wondered\Nhow great he was.

14:45.930 --> 14:47.759
I'll begin now.

14:49.999 --> 14:51.570
Did you start the fire\Non the truck...

14:51.999 --> 14:53.940
in Joongjin-dong?

14:53.940 --> 14:54.940
No.

14:55.369 --> 14:56.469
I see.

14:57.070 --> 14:59.469
What about Joongjin\NEnglish School?

14:59.469 --> 15:01.239
I've never been there.

15:01.780 --> 15:02.910
I see.

15:03.210 --> 15:05.410
You've never been there.

15:06.479 --> 15:07.849
Then you must not\Nhave started the fire...

15:07.849 --> 15:09.180
at the fourth franchise\Nof Genoise.

15:09.180 --> 15:11.889
Did Genoise open\Ntheir fourth franchise?

15:13.619 --> 15:15.460
I only know about\Nthe third franchise.

15:16.989 --> 15:18.160
Na Jin Tae?

15:18.729 --> 15:20.700
He got caught already.

15:20.700 --> 15:22.229
Maybe he bought it\Nbeforehand...

15:22.229 --> 15:23.330
for his alibi.

15:23.869 --> 15:24.969
I have a feeling\Nabout this...

15:24.969 --> 15:26.200
and my dream yesterday\Nwas weird too.

15:27.700 --> 15:28.869
You have something, right?

15:30.570 --> 15:31.639
You figured something\Nout, right?

15:33.080 --> 15:35.009
Are you popular among\Nconscripted policemen?

15:35.009 --> 15:36.509
What is this about now?

15:36.879 --> 15:39.550
I think one of them\Nis stalking you.

15:45.719 --> 15:47.060
Hey! Come over here.

15:49.259 --> 15:50.259
Come here.

15:50.660 --> 15:52.589
- Come here.\N- Gosh.

15:53.530 --> 15:54.900
You little punk.

16:02.099 --> 16:05.509
Seriously, this woman...

16:10.310 --> 16:13.280
- Do you love me?\N- No, what on earth...

16:13.550 --> 16:14.879
Then why would\Nyou stalk me?

16:14.879 --> 16:16.950
Well, he said he'd let me\Nuse my cellphone...

16:16.950 --> 16:18.719
if I kept an eye on you.

16:18.719 --> 16:20.790
- Who?\N- The Yuk Gye Partners.

16:20.790 --> 16:21.859
Who?

16:21.859 --> 16:23.989
Mr. Yuk and Mr. Gye.

16:25.160 --> 16:26.530
That makes sense.

16:27.560 --> 16:28.560
Why did they ask you\Nto do such a thing?

16:28.560 --> 16:29.800
To watch whether\Nyou meet up...

16:29.800 --> 16:31.430
with the detectives\Nfrom the headquarters.

16:31.430 --> 16:32.869
What did you\Nreport to them?

16:34.170 --> 16:36.710
About the fire...

16:36.710 --> 16:38.170
and that the lady is here.

16:38.670 --> 16:40.009
I need to report\Nabout the quicklime too.

16:40.009 --> 16:41.810
Are you trying to spy\Non me in front of my eyes?

16:43.580 --> 16:44.580
Right.

16:44.680 --> 16:46.109
My guess is right.

16:46.879 --> 16:48.450
My guess is right.

16:50.349 --> 16:52.450
Tell me what\Nyour guess is.

16:53.259 --> 16:54.320
There's...

16:55.820 --> 16:57.060
more than one culprit.

16:57.629 --> 16:59.030
There's someone else\Nother than Na Jin Tae?

16:59.229 --> 17:01.030
There's more? Awesome.

17:03.599 --> 17:05.569
Ma'am.

17:05.569 --> 17:07.700
A fire broke out\Nnearby last night.

17:07.700 --> 17:09.810
Police cars\Nand fire trucks...

17:09.868 --> 17:10.910
I know.

17:13.979 --> 17:15.079
Is it okay?

17:16.309 --> 17:18.479
I heard people\Ngot injured.

17:22.519 --> 17:23.749
I mean, the cake.

17:24.619 --> 17:25.619
Pardon?

17:26.089 --> 17:27.089
The other culprit...

17:27.589 --> 17:29.829
has something to do\Nwith the fourth franchise.

17:30.329 --> 17:32.860
Na Jin Tae caused the fire\Nat Genoise and got caught.

17:32.860 --> 17:34.930
We watched the video\Nof Arbiter of Fire too.

17:34.930 --> 17:36.370
That's about\Nthe third franchise.

17:36.670 --> 17:39.469
He didn't start the fire\Nat the fourth franchise.

17:40.670 --> 17:43.440
You didn't set neither\Nthe student residence,

17:43.440 --> 17:45.670
internet cafe, bar, nor\Ncar repair shop on fire.

17:45.910 --> 17:48.309
You didn't go anywhere\Nnear that mineral spring.

17:50.509 --> 17:53.420
You did nothing wrong.

17:54.450 --> 17:55.779
I'm telling you.

17:57.789 --> 17:59.190
Goodness.

18:00.620 --> 18:02.930
There must've been some\Nkind of misunderstanding.

18:02.930 --> 18:05.259
So release me already.

18:05.430 --> 18:06.759
Of course, I will.

18:07.259 --> 18:08.400
Before that,

18:09.400 --> 18:10.400
you need to go through...

18:11.069 --> 18:12.900
some procedures.

18:13.799 --> 18:16.440
It won't take a long time.

18:19.009 --> 18:20.009
Hold on.

18:24.749 --> 18:26.779
It's been bugging me\Na little.

18:27.719 --> 18:29.019
Sit properly.

18:33.019 --> 18:34.319
Be quiet.

18:37.390 --> 18:40.130
You aren't the only one\Nin this station, you know.

18:46.299 --> 18:48.239
Have a great time.

19:04.219 --> 19:05.950
Like you said,\Nthe MO is Na Jin Tae's.

19:05.950 --> 19:08.219
There are a lot of crazy\Narsonists in every town.

19:08.489 --> 19:10.590
But no one uses various\Nmethods like Na Jin Tae.

19:10.590 --> 19:12.789
He used quicklime,\Nacetone, alcohol, and...

19:12.789 --> 19:14.900
This culprit copied\NNa Jin Tae's way.

19:16.100 --> 19:17.170
It's a copycat crime?

19:17.469 --> 19:19.600
- Copycat? Gosh!\N- Quiet.

19:20.039 --> 19:22.069
It's just as\NNa Jin Tae did.

19:22.100 --> 19:25.170
The quicklime, delivery,\Nweather forecast,

19:25.309 --> 19:26.809
and covering it with\Na paper box too.

19:29.309 --> 19:31.610
If you make an order\Nas a non-member,

19:31.610 --> 19:33.749
no evidence is left.

19:33.749 --> 19:35.279
(Wumyung Lime)

19:35.920 --> 19:37.289
They copied\Nexactly the same.

19:37.420 --> 19:38.789
It's unnecessarily\Nsimilar.

19:40.920 --> 19:43.630
The culprit is\Nin our hands now.

19:43.729 --> 19:45.229
Let's track down\Nthe IP address first.

19:45.229 --> 19:46.900
It cannot be tracked\Nin the deep web.

19:46.900 --> 19:49.059
It's possible\Nfor the headquarters.

19:49.130 --> 19:51.269
Even FBI can't do it.

19:51.269 --> 19:53.069
We can't find even\Nthe IP address either.

19:53.069 --> 19:54.340
What do you\Nknow about FBI?

19:54.539 --> 19:57.370
We can find it if we go\Nthrough banks and ATMs.

19:57.710 --> 19:58.969
It's only\Na matter of time.

19:59.340 --> 20:01.239
So go home, and I'll go to\NJoongjin Police Station...

20:02.809 --> 20:03.850
You'll come\Nwith me, right?

20:03.850 --> 20:05.410
You know already,\Nso why do you ask?

20:08.719 --> 20:09.789
Why are you following us?

20:10.319 --> 20:11.519
I finished my duty.

20:11.590 --> 20:12.590
Keep watching the scene\Na little longer.

20:12.920 --> 20:13.920
What?

20:33.940 --> 20:35.680
I wanted to enjoy a\Nperformance after a while,

20:35.680 --> 20:37.150
but my mood was ruined.

20:37.680 --> 20:40.150
The kids had no manner\Nand were so rude.

20:40.380 --> 20:42.380
I wonder how their\Nparents educated them.

20:42.719 --> 20:44.319
They made a mess\Nwith toilet papers...

20:44.319 --> 20:45.950
when others were around.

20:50.789 --> 20:53.130
That's why you\Nstarted the fire, right?

20:54.229 --> 20:55.630
I only acted as\Nthe Arbiter of Fire.

20:59.799 --> 21:00.840
You punk.

21:00.940 --> 21:03.210
Who are you to judge them?

21:03.469 --> 21:04.509
What else?

21:04.840 --> 21:05.969
That's all.

21:09.950 --> 21:10.979
Hello?

21:11.710 --> 21:13.880
Hello? Hello?

21:27.430 --> 21:30.700
Look at this.\NYou're being absurd.

21:31.029 --> 21:33.670
- I didn't do it.\N- Look at this.

21:34.739 --> 21:36.039
It's huge.

21:36.809 --> 21:39.210
It's quite different from\NSeodong Police Station.

21:39.210 --> 21:40.739
You're so tacky.

21:41.180 --> 21:43.549
What's the problem?\NWhat is it?

21:43.809 --> 21:45.309
Constable Kim!

21:49.950 --> 21:51.420
(Footage recorded by\NFire Investigation Unit)

21:51.420 --> 21:52.690
Detective Ha.

21:52.690 --> 21:54.319
(Units record video\Nfootage of incidents.)

21:55.690 --> 21:57.829
I heard your house caught\Non fire. Are you okay?

21:57.960 --> 21:59.059
Yes.

21:59.160 --> 22:00.999
Did you hurt your ankle?

22:01.460 --> 22:03.569
This isn't good. You\Nshould take some days off.

22:03.569 --> 22:05.569
I'll tell\Nthe manager for you.

22:05.569 --> 22:07.569
- I still have work left.\N- Hey.

22:08.140 --> 22:11.569
Some may think\NI'm exploiting you.

22:11.940 --> 22:14.239
We already caught\Nthe serial arsonist.

22:15.440 --> 22:17.509
There's another arsonist.

22:17.509 --> 22:19.009
You can't be in here\Nwithout clearance.

22:19.009 --> 22:21.420
There is a copycat\Nof Na Jin Tae.

22:21.420 --> 22:23.819
And the copycat is\Nmore dangerous...

22:23.819 --> 22:24.950
and bolder than\NNa Jin Tae.

22:24.950 --> 22:26.390
You watched\Ntoo many movies.

22:26.590 --> 22:27.590
A copycat?

22:28.319 --> 22:29.829
Why don't you\Nhear her out...

22:29.829 --> 22:31.229
before you look down\Non her?

22:31.430 --> 22:34.400
Do I have to sit around\Nand listen to ladies talk?

22:34.829 --> 22:36.769
It's considered a theft\Nto touch that.

22:36.900 --> 22:38.870
You can't touch that.

22:40.140 --> 22:41.600
He already\Nmade a confession.

22:41.600 --> 22:43.509
We have the video footage.

22:43.509 --> 22:45.140
And we even have\Nhis fingerprints.

22:45.670 --> 22:47.739
There's nothing more\Nto investigate. It's over.

22:47.739 --> 22:50.410
There's a case where you\Nnever found a fingerprint.

22:51.309 --> 22:53.120
You didn't find it\Nat the fourth franchise.

23:12.329 --> 23:14.600
I'm right, aren't I?

23:16.140 --> 23:17.940
You didn't find\Na fingerprint there.

23:17.940 --> 23:20.009
We can't always\Nfind fingerprints.

23:20.009 --> 23:22.440
It could've been erased\Nwhen the fire was put out.

23:23.479 --> 23:24.680
There are\Ntwo different arsonists...

23:24.680 --> 23:25.880
for the 3rd\Nand the 4th franchise.

23:25.880 --> 23:27.450
The acetone used for\Nthe third store...

23:27.450 --> 23:29.049
smelled like strawberries.

23:31.719 --> 23:32.819
It smells like\Nstrawberries.

23:34.059 --> 23:35.690
But for the fourth store,

23:35.759 --> 23:37.460
it just smelled\Nlike acetone.

23:41.930 --> 23:43.170
It's acetone.

23:43.329 --> 23:44.870
So what?

23:45.100 --> 23:46.499
Who stores\Nvideo footage...

23:46.499 --> 23:48.640
in huge CDs like these?\NThis is so old.

23:48.640 --> 23:50.110
Don't touch those.\NPut them down.

23:50.110 --> 23:51.309
I'm not even interested.

23:52.110 --> 23:53.640
Acetone with fragrance...

23:53.640 --> 23:55.340
is usually used\Nto remove nail polish.

23:55.340 --> 23:57.610
He probably bought that\Nat a cosmetics shop.

24:03.850 --> 24:06.420
But the ones that have\Nno smell...

24:06.420 --> 24:08.460
are usually sold at\Na pharmacy or a market.

24:09.059 --> 24:11.390
So what? What are you\Ntrying to say?

24:14.600 --> 24:16.600
One of them thinks...

24:16.600 --> 24:19.229
acetone is\Ncosmetics product,

24:19.299 --> 24:22.539
and the other thinks\Nit's chemical.

24:23.039 --> 24:24.969
It's to confuse\Nthe investigation.

24:25.710 --> 24:27.309
He did it on purpose.

24:28.539 --> 24:31.610
Criminals these days\Nare really clever.

24:31.880 --> 24:34.249
He's been setting the same\Nfranchise on fire...

24:34.249 --> 24:36.450
with the same method.

24:36.450 --> 24:38.650
Did he just confuse you\Nwith acetone?

24:38.650 --> 24:41.019
Yes, it doesn't\Nmake sense.

24:42.559 --> 24:44.660
Cigarettes were\Ndifferent as well.

24:48.130 --> 24:51.269
You don't have to smoke\Nthe same cigarette.

24:51.400 --> 24:53.269
I smoke menthol\Nwhen my neck gets dry.

24:53.269 --> 24:54.840
There's a more\Nimportant difference.

24:55.469 --> 24:57.809
The arsonist for the third\Nstore actually smoked.

24:58.009 --> 25:00.340
But the fourth one\Njust lit it on fire.

25:00.739 --> 25:02.809
It was someone\Nwho couldn't smoke.

25:03.009 --> 25:05.049
You really don't get it,\Ndo you?

25:06.049 --> 25:08.279
He didn't do it because\Nit can give away his DNA.

25:08.279 --> 25:09.920
Let me tell you\None more time.

25:10.049 --> 25:12.219
Criminals these days are\Nreally well-versed...

25:12.219 --> 25:13.489
with DNA and fingerprints.

25:13.519 --> 25:15.960
You must be joking.

25:16.529 --> 25:18.590
His fingerprints were\Nfound, and he smoked...

25:18.590 --> 25:20.059
at the third franchise.

25:20.529 --> 25:23.170
You said the two are done\Nby the same criminal.

25:24.930 --> 25:26.739
You want to\Nshut her up, don't you?

25:26.900 --> 25:28.100
That happens to me\Noften too.

25:28.100 --> 25:30.039
But oddly,\Nshe's always right.

25:30.569 --> 25:31.739
Be quiet.

25:32.569 --> 25:35.880
So what?\NWho's the culprit?

25:36.140 --> 25:38.309
- The culprit is...\N- Ms. Yoo!

25:38.309 --> 25:39.350
Ms. Yoo.

25:40.019 --> 25:41.880
- Manager Jo.\N- Manager Jo.

25:43.920 --> 25:45.120
- Manager Jo.\N- I'm fine.

25:45.120 --> 25:47.059
Go away.

25:48.289 --> 25:49.590
Goodness.

25:49.890 --> 25:52.160
It's Ms. Yoo,\Nour honorary officer...

25:52.160 --> 25:53.700
who brought honor\Nto our station.

25:53.700 --> 25:56.400
I've been waiting. Why\Ndidn't you come sooner?

25:56.400 --> 25:57.870
Hello.

25:57.870 --> 26:00.640
Yes, I'm fine.

26:00.840 --> 26:04.009
It's an honor to\Nmeet you in person.

26:04.009 --> 26:06.440
If I had known\Nyou were coming,

26:06.440 --> 26:08.479
I would've gone out\Nto greet you myself.

26:08.910 --> 26:10.809
You don't have to do that.

26:10.809 --> 26:13.180
No, you deserve it.

26:13.549 --> 26:15.079
Please come to my room.

26:15.079 --> 26:17.219
Be careful.\NThe floor is slippery.

26:17.219 --> 26:20.460
Why are you cleaning this\Ntoday of all days?

26:20.460 --> 26:22.559
Be careful. Come this way.

26:23.160 --> 26:25.160
And what\Nwere you thinking?

26:25.360 --> 26:28.059
You should've brought her\Nto my room already.

26:28.059 --> 26:30.769
You let her stand around\Non a slippery floor.

26:31.469 --> 26:33.239
Please come.

26:33.239 --> 26:34.539
Step on\Nthese tissue papers.

26:34.539 --> 26:36.440
The floor is slippery.

26:36.440 --> 26:37.969
Step on these.

26:42.110 --> 26:43.309
You do know that\Nour station has...

26:43.309 --> 26:45.809
the highest arrest rate\Nin the country, right?

26:46.549 --> 26:49.019
But we don't have\Nenough budget...

26:49.019 --> 26:51.650
or people.\NIt's killing us.

26:52.150 --> 26:54.559
It's such a relief\Nto know...

26:54.559 --> 26:57.059
that there are\Npeople like you out there.

27:04.370 --> 27:06.340
Look at this lady.

27:06.700 --> 27:07.769
This is no good.

27:07.769 --> 27:10.509
Wan Seung and this lady\Nshouldn't be together.

27:10.509 --> 27:11.769
Make sure\Nyou separate them.

27:11.769 --> 27:13.309
Pour hot water on them\Nor something.

27:13.309 --> 27:16.509
The chief is going to be\Nreally concerned about it.

27:16.509 --> 27:19.009
How can I do anything\Nabout a civilian...

27:19.009 --> 27:20.979
who hasn't done a thing?

27:24.850 --> 27:27.559
What a headache. She was\Neven awarded for this.

27:33.029 --> 27:35.759
Never mind. I got this.

27:35.759 --> 27:37.600
(Happy Class with\NJoongjin Police Station)

27:38.229 --> 27:40.600
What? No one called you?

27:41.469 --> 27:43.410
No way.\NWe kept calling you...

27:43.410 --> 27:44.969
to tell you about\Nthe special class.

27:45.410 --> 27:47.279
Then I'll do it next time.

27:49.210 --> 27:52.049
There's another arsonist\Nother than Na Jin Tae.

27:52.249 --> 27:53.579
If you don't\Nget him now...

27:53.579 --> 27:54.680
Wait a minute.

27:54.680 --> 27:57.489
Are you giving up\Non fulfilling your duty?

27:57.950 --> 28:00.890
Then you can't\Nkeep your status...

28:00.890 --> 28:02.420
as an honorary officer.

28:02.420 --> 28:03.930
That's disappointing.

28:03.930 --> 28:04.989
Then...

28:05.329 --> 28:07.100
do I have to go by myself?

28:07.100 --> 28:08.100
No.

28:08.100 --> 28:10.900
(Interrogation Room)

28:10.900 --> 28:11.900
Detective Ha.

28:13.269 --> 28:15.239
Who said\Nyou can go in there?

28:16.200 --> 28:18.269
I never needed permission\Nto question a suspect.

Then does my break begin\Nas of now?

Organize the documents\Nin that box.

31:12.479 --> 31:13.850
Yes, sir!

31:20.960 --> 31:22.890
Just because\Nhe's a team leader...

31:23.090 --> 31:24.590
doesn't mean he can\Norder me around.

31:24.930 --> 31:26.759
He should help me first...

31:26.759 --> 31:28.700
before asking me for help.

31:28.900 --> 31:29.969
Darn it.

33:02.019 --> 33:04.460
Let's see.\NHow about Si Eun?

33:04.829 --> 33:06.160
What do you need to do\Nto become...

33:06.160 --> 33:07.499
an honorary\Npolice officer?

33:08.799 --> 33:12.100
You have to catch\N13 marriage scammers.

33:12.100 --> 33:13.440
All 13 scammers?

33:13.670 --> 33:14.799
If that's too many,

33:14.799 --> 33:17.340
you can just catch\None serial murderer.

33:20.440 --> 33:23.509
Don't talk about\Nserial murderer to kids.

33:24.249 --> 33:25.979
Is this the only acetone\Nyou carry?

33:25.979 --> 33:26.979
Yes.

33:26.979 --> 33:29.690
Did anyone buy this\Nin bulk recently?

33:29.690 --> 33:30.690
No.

33:31.190 --> 33:32.190
Okay.

33:32.190 --> 33:34.219
It was delivered and\Nleft outside the building.

33:34.489 --> 33:36.489
I asked the internet\Nshopping mall,

33:36.489 --> 33:37.989
but they don't have\Nany information...

33:37.989 --> 33:39.460
since it was ordered\Nby a non-member.

33:39.630 --> 33:41.229
Shouldn't there be\Na payment record?

33:41.529 --> 33:42.900
You need a warrant...

33:42.900 --> 33:44.370
to obtain customer\Ninformation.

33:44.370 --> 33:46.400
- What?\N- It's a sensitive issue.

33:46.640 --> 33:49.440
Gosh, a warrant.

33:51.410 --> 33:52.569
Other than\Ncatching culprits,

33:52.569 --> 33:54.239
what was the best thing\Nyou did?

33:58.450 --> 34:00.150
Taking\Nmy wedding ring off.

34:00.779 --> 34:02.180
Don't say such things.

34:02.180 --> 34:03.890
Divorce isn't something\Nto brag about.

34:03.890 --> 34:05.090
Don't say it.

34:05.090 --> 34:07.590
When is the most difficult\Ntime for you?

34:08.059 --> 34:10.630
When policemen do that.

34:12.998 --> 34:14.829
Doesn't this\Nlook like a bird?

34:15.460 --> 34:19.429
Ma'am, what happened\Nto that man?

34:20.670 --> 34:22.969
The man who started fires\Nin the neighborhood.

34:25.440 --> 34:26.809
He...

34:27.909 --> 34:29.010

Do you sell Peace?

34:58.210 --> 34:59.470
Not many stores\Ncarry that.

34:59.470 --> 35:00.479
Yes, we do.

35:02.010 --> 35:03.010
- Here.\N- No.

35:03.179 --> 35:04.849
I'm not here to buy it.

35:05.110 --> 35:06.780
Is there someone\Nwho buys this regularly?

35:06.780 --> 35:08.249
No, not really.

35:09.119 --> 35:10.820
But the man who just left\Nbought one.

35:22.929 --> 35:24.030

35:46.460 --> 35:48.490
Come over here.

35:48.889 --> 35:51.030
Ms. Yoo. Look how...

35:51.030 --> 35:53.159

35:53.159 --> 35:55.460
They are touched\Nby your story.

35:56.429 --> 35:59.070
"I want to learn more!" is\Nwhat they're saying...

We have a cooking class...

36:36.369 --> 36:38.670

36:43.280 --> 36:45.010
I mean...

36:48.479 --> 36:49.650
I need to\Ngo to the bathroom.

36:49.990 --> 36:51.789

36:56.559 --> 36:58.860
- Why?\N- It's a ladies' room.

36:58.860 --> 36:59.999
So what?

37:01.130 --> 37:02.360

37:32.860 --> 37:34.929

37:35.099 --> 37:36.829
Was the culprit really\Nnear the house?

37:37.070 --> 37:38.170
Quicklime was delivered,

37:38.170 --> 37:39.869
so that can't prove\Nhe was at the scene.

37:40.170 --> 37:42.340
Detective Ha. Did you\Nreport that you moved in?

37:42.340 --> 37:44.240
I didn't have a chance\Nbecause of the fire.

37:51.380 --> 37:53.079
How can you not know\Nyour own address?

37:53.079 --> 37:54.820
My place was on fire after\Nthree days of moving in.

37:55.179 --> 37:56.179
Wait.

37:57.349 --> 37:58.949
You're weird.

37:58.949 --> 38:00.559
How do you know\Nthe exact address?

38:00.690 --> 38:01.760
Were you planning\Nto visit me again?

38:01.760 --> 38:02.960
Are you obsessed with me?

38:02.960 --> 38:04.059
In your dreams.

38:05.690 --> 38:07.760
He got your address\Neasily.

38:07.760 --> 38:09.530
But he didn't know\Nthe exact unit.

38:10.999 --> 38:12.130

38:15.400 --> 38:16.470
That's strange.

38:16.539 --> 38:17.840
He wants me to leave it\Nout here.

38:20.340 --> 38:23.110
(Wumyung Lime)

38:24.280 --> 38:25.979
(Leave it at the mailbox\Nwhen nobody's home.)

He found out\Nwhere you lived because...

38:28.479 --> 38:31.389
He saw me\Ngo into my house.

38:32.389 --> 38:33.389
The culprit is...

38:33.789 --> 38:35.690

Sometimes in dramas,

39:44.929 --> 39:46.729
police officers turn out\Nto be the culprits.

39:46.729 --> 39:48.499
That's enough.\NAnything else?

39:49.059 --> 39:50.400
Oh, this woman.

39:51.099 --> 39:52.099
She was there...

39:52.099 --> 39:53.199
when the English\NSchool was on fire.

39:53.199 --> 39:54.769
She was wearing\Nsomething different then.

39:57.940 --> 39:59.309
She's wearing a gown.

39:59.579 --> 40:00.639
Is she a doctor?

40:13.659 --> 40:14.659
Ma'am.

40:15.019 --> 40:16.690
Won't you go to\Nthe second franchise?

40:17.929 --> 40:18.990
No.

40:20.659 --> 40:21.900
Could you go?

40:23.099 --> 40:24.800
I have to meet someone.

40:28.369 --> 40:29.499
You're lying.

How can you remember\Nevery passerby?

40:31.970 --> 40:33.679
I even remember\Ntheir clothes.

40:34.079 --> 40:35.510
He was there too.

40:35.639 --> 40:37.880
I'll make a call\Nand check if you're lying.

40:45.690 --> 40:46.760
Constable Lee.

40:46.760 --> 40:47.860
Were you at the scene...

40:47.860 --> 40:49.829
of Joongjin English\NSchool fire?

40:50.630 --> 40:53.329
He was wearing\Ncheap green running shoes.

40:54.630 --> 40:56.570
Do you have cheap\Ngreen running shoes?

40:58.729 --> 40:59.769
Okay.

40:59.769 --> 41:00.840
I was correct, right?

41:01.470 --> 41:03.369
No. Those are expensive.

41:04.110 --> 41:06.039
You have pretty good\Nmemory.

41:06.280 --> 41:07.409
She's a pharmacist.

41:07.740 --> 41:08.780
A pharmacist?

41:12.479 --> 41:14.220
There's a pharmacy\Nat the end over there.

41:14.820 --> 41:17.449
Doctors wouldn't go around\Nin their gowns like this.

41:18.150 --> 41:19.320
Zoom in.

41:20.220 --> 41:22.590
(Wonjae Pharmacy)

41:22.590 --> 41:24.090
"Wonjae Pharmacy"?

41:26.630 --> 41:30.030
(Wonjae Pharmacy)

41:30.030 --> 41:32.199
You, be on standby here.

41:32.429 --> 41:33.470
What?

41:38.139 --> 41:39.510
How can I help you?

41:54.619 --> 41:57.159
Excuse me.\NWhat are you looking for?

41:58.329 --> 41:59.490
(Acetone)

42:01.559 --> 42:02.659
I'll take this.

42:16.010 --> 42:18.710
Glue might work\Nbetter for hallucination.

42:19.380 --> 42:20.579
We have things to remove.

42:20.579 --> 42:21.679
By any chance,

42:22.150 --> 42:23.789
do you know\Na fire broke out...

42:23.789 --> 42:25.320
at Joongjin English\NSchool?

42:26.389 --> 42:28.860
I do. I saw it myself.

42:28.860 --> 42:30.360
I went to pick my son up\Nand saw it.

42:47.010 --> 42:48.979
I'm back from school.

42:50.309 --> 42:52.920
Wait,\Nit's the divorced lady.

42:53.949 --> 42:55.979
Did you spread your\Nstory even in school?

42:58.190 --> 42:59.590
You look smart.

43:01.220 --> 43:02.460
Do you want candy?

43:03.329 --> 43:04.559
Thank you.

43:04.729 --> 43:06.300
How polite.

43:07.300 --> 43:08.360
Won Jae.

43:08.630 --> 43:10.300
Go upstairs, and\Ndo your homework now.

43:11.170 --> 43:12.199
Okay.

43:20.909 --> 43:22.309
It hurts. Let me go.

43:22.309 --> 43:24.150
You little punk.

43:24.150 --> 43:26.920
Mister!\NWhat are you doing?

43:28.280 --> 43:29.920
I think I know\Nthat scary lady.

43:35.190 --> 43:37.260
Is she the culprit?

43:37.260 --> 43:38.289
No way.

43:38.289 --> 43:39.530
We saw the cigarettes.

43:39.530 --> 43:41.059
This acetone\Nsmells similar too.

43:41.400 --> 43:43.030
I'm getting the feeling.

43:43.229 --> 43:46.070
The culprit is\Nin that pharmacy.

43:46.400 --> 43:48.699
She's a fine pharmacist.\NWhy did she commit arson?

43:48.699 --> 43:51.039
You harassed her son.

43:51.039 --> 43:52.409
That can't be a reason.

43:52.409 --> 43:54.139
Na Jin Tae\Ncommitted arson...

43:54.139 --> 43:55.979
simply because the granny\Nsplashed water on him.

43:57.079 --> 43:58.309
Maybe...

43:58.610 --> 44:00.780
she even copied\Nthe reason for arson.

44:00.780 --> 44:02.650
That can't be\Nclear evidence.

44:03.150 --> 44:04.889
Did you go over the CCTV\Nfootages near the place...

44:04.889 --> 44:07.019
- taken between 3 to 4pm?\N- Yes, I did.

44:07.260 --> 44:08.690
She stayed at the pharmacy\Nthe whole time.

44:08.690 --> 44:09.829
- Are you sure?\N- Yes.

44:09.829 --> 44:11.530
I checked even without\Nblinking my eyes.

44:12.360 --> 44:13.800
- You just did.\N- No.

44:14.329 --> 44:15.630
Is there a back door?

44:19.199 --> 44:21.070
- It's mine.\N- I see.

44:23.470 --> 44:24.470
Hello?

44:27.039 --> 44:28.539
The owner of Genoise?

44:38.090 --> 44:40.460
Did you really witness\Nthe fire?

44:41.619 --> 44:43.990
Yes, I reported it too.

44:44.490 --> 44:47.630
I heard the fire truck\Nwas coming,

44:47.630 --> 44:49.429
so I felt relieved\Nand came back here.

44:54.199 --> 44:55.269
What's that?

45:00.309 --> 45:01.579
It's on fire.

45:08.349 --> 45:10.150
I'm in Joongjin West-dong.

45:10.690 --> 45:12.249
There's a house on fire.

45:13.119 --> 45:15.490
Yes, the alley\Nwith the pharmacy.

45:18.960 --> 45:20.630
The firetruck is\Ncoming already?

45:22.059 --> 45:24.769
I had no idea\Nit was your house.

45:27.539 --> 45:30.369
By the way, why did\Nyou want to see me?

45:30.840 --> 45:33.579
I went to the site\Na while ago...

45:34.079 --> 45:36.210
because I felt\Nuncomfortable.

45:38.309 --> 45:40.119
I'm not sure,

45:41.820 --> 45:43.449
but I think...

45:45.050 --> 45:46.820
I saw the arsonist.

45:47.360 --> 45:49.729
The arsonist? Where?

45:49.729 --> 45:51.429
There was someone\Nstanding...

45:52.760 --> 45:54.400
in front of your house,

45:55.460 --> 45:56.769
watching the fire.

46:04.639 --> 46:06.280
The firetruck is\Ncoming already?

46:06.840 --> 46:07.840
Then...

46:08.579 --> 46:10.280
is this all over now?

46:10.710 --> 46:13.720
By any chance, is there\Nanything else I should do?

46:14.550 --> 46:16.119
I've never\Ndone this before.

46:17.820 --> 46:20.420
I see. Thank you.

46:31.769 --> 46:32.769
At that time,

46:33.539 --> 46:36.340
I saw a yellow umbrella\Nfar away from here.

47:02.530 --> 47:04.699
That person was coming\Nto the main street,

47:06.070 --> 47:07.440
but then he\Ndisappeared suddenly.

47:09.269 --> 47:10.610
A yellow umbrella.

47:18.880 --> 47:20.849
If the person with\Na yellow umbrella...

47:20.849 --> 47:22.550
walked towards here\Nand disappeared...

47:22.550 --> 47:24.349
It means\Nhe lives around here.

47:25.789 --> 47:27.019
It's suspicious.

47:27.760 --> 47:29.519
- Detective Ha.\N- Yes?

47:29.519 --> 47:31.929
Are you okay? Your leg...

47:34.499 --> 47:36.829
What's this?

47:37.229 --> 47:38.729
What is this?

47:39.400 --> 47:40.800
What happened?

47:41.639 --> 47:42.970
What's wrong with you?

47:44.470 --> 47:47.110
You always get hurt.

47:47.240 --> 47:48.639
It's only this much\Nbecause it's me.

47:49.039 --> 47:51.380
I survived from the\Nburning house after all.

47:52.380 --> 47:53.519
Does it hurt a lot?

47:53.519 --> 47:55.050
It's bearable.

47:55.079 --> 47:57.320
Hang on a little.\NWe're almost there.

47:57.920 --> 47:59.449
I don't need to go\Nto a hospital.

47:59.449 --> 48:01.260
I just need to put\Na bandage around it.

48:02.090 --> 48:03.490
I'm sorry\Nfor causing trouble.

48:22.079 --> 48:24.610
Thank you.\NYou can go back now.

48:24.610 --> 48:26.679
I'll go after I see\Nyou get treated.

48:26.679 --> 48:28.920
It's okay.\NI'll be with him.

48:28.920 --> 48:30.550
You must be busy.\NYou can go.

48:30.550 --> 48:31.849
Aren't you busy?

48:31.920 --> 48:33.059
Let's go.

48:34.320 --> 48:36.019
Gosh, what should\Nwe do with it?

48:36.530 --> 48:39.289
Goodness.

48:48.599 --> 48:50.809
How could you\Nbe this ignorant?

48:50.809 --> 48:52.909
You should come to the\Nhospital if it's this bad.

48:53.110 --> 48:55.479
I'm not a doctor. I\Nthought it'd get better...

48:55.479 --> 48:56.780
when I took some rest.

49:00.079 --> 49:01.249
Here.

49:01.249 --> 49:02.349
What?

49:02.650 --> 49:03.650
What?

49:03.650 --> 49:06.559
I don't want to\Nsee you limping.

49:07.119 --> 49:08.519
I can walk alone.

49:09.360 --> 49:11.260
Then walk alone\Nas you wish.

49:25.039 --> 49:26.940
Well, the doctor told me\Nto be careful.

49:27.510 --> 49:30.079
If you want to\Nhelp me out so badly,

49:30.079 --> 49:31.479
I'll let you do that.

49:39.090 --> 49:40.190
Gosh, it's cold.

49:40.260 --> 49:41.860
Where will you sleep?

49:41.889 --> 49:43.590
I'll sleep at my house.\NOh, right.

49:44.090 --> 49:45.190
It burned down.

49:45.329 --> 49:47.229
You have to preserve\Nthe scene too.

49:47.599 --> 49:49.329
I'll just sleep\Nat a sauna then.

49:49.329 --> 49:50.499
I'm all right.

49:51.699 --> 49:53.800
You're injured.\NYou can't do that.

49:53.800 --> 49:55.570
Let's go to Baebang-dong.

49:55.599 --> 49:57.070
Kyung Mi isn't\Nat home either.

49:59.039 --> 50:01.240
She slipped out\Nafter taking the ring,

50:01.309 --> 50:02.579
so what's gotten into her?

50:04.179 --> 50:06.110
You don't have any\Nother intention, do you?

50:06.780 --> 50:08.579
I'm not that easy,\Nyou know.

50:09.320 --> 50:11.519
Sure, sure. I know.

50:11.519 --> 50:13.320
If you're planning to do\Nsomething while I'm hurt,

50:13.320 --> 50:15.360
you better give up.\NI'm an upright man.

50:15.360 --> 50:18.229
If you're that anxious,\Ngo sleep at a sauna.

50:18.729 --> 50:20.360
Gosh, it hurts so bad.

50:20.800 --> 50:22.329
Men must have\Nhealthy ankles.

50:22.329 --> 50:23.800
I might not be able to\Nwalk properly again.

50:24.199 --> 50:26.130
I guess men must be\Nhealthy in so many ways.

50:27.340 --> 50:28.599
Aren't you hungry?

50:29.300 --> 50:31.409
I ate cup noodles all day,\Nso I'm hungry.

50:31.409 --> 50:32.639
Let's hurry and go.

50:34.039 --> 50:35.809
I'll make you\Nsomething delicious.

50:39.179 --> 50:40.650
Can't we dine outside?

50:41.280 --> 50:42.780
Let's go already.

51:03.269 --> 51:04.639
Gosh, it's hot.

51:04.840 --> 51:06.210
There, there.

51:09.949 --> 51:12.150
How long will it take you\Nto cook doenjang stew?

51:14.979 --> 51:16.889
That's the thing with men.

51:16.889 --> 51:20.260
They think stew is just\Nwater and ingredients.

51:21.460 --> 51:22.590
Are you playing house?

51:23.490 --> 51:25.059
Move aside. Forget it.

51:26.429 --> 51:27.829
- Move.\N- What?

51:29.970 --> 51:31.670
What are you doing?

51:35.039 --> 51:36.409
Be careful.

51:37.139 --> 51:38.639
This is how you do it.

51:42.579 --> 51:44.579
You can't make\Nstew like that.

51:47.619 --> 51:48.949
You didn't even\Nput doenjang in.

51:49.079 --> 51:50.320
Isn't this doenjang stew?

52:04.229 --> 52:05.229
How is it?

52:06.240 --> 52:07.269
Is it weird?

52:13.179 --> 52:14.280
It's okay.

52:15.280 --> 52:16.550
You think this is okay?

52:17.349 --> 52:19.210
This isn't just okay.

52:20.979 --> 52:22.720
It's so good.

52:23.820 --> 52:24.889
You're the best.

52:25.690 --> 52:27.389
See? I told you\Nthat I'm a good cook.

52:27.619 --> 52:29.220
It's so good.

52:29.220 --> 52:30.760
You're much\Nbetter than me.

52:31.729 --> 52:33.429
Thanks for the food.

52:58.849 --> 53:00.920
I'm really tired.

53:00.920 --> 53:02.420
But why can't I\Ngo to sleep?

53:12.099 --> 53:13.970
It looks like\Nshe can't sleep either.

53:15.570 --> 53:17.769
Is it because she's too\Nexcited to be with me?

53:18.940 --> 53:20.079
Goodness.

53:20.880 --> 53:22.909
I'm not that special.

53:36.329 --> 53:37.530
Detective Ha.

53:38.429 --> 53:39.460
Are you asleep?

53:40.960 --> 53:43.329
She's more forward\Nthan she looks.

53:45.329 --> 53:46.499
Do I look that easy?

53:49.740 --> 53:50.740
Are you asleep?

53:55.280 --> 53:57.280
Why is he asleep already?

54:11.260 --> 54:12.360
You weren't sleeping?

54:14.059 --> 54:15.059
Lady.

54:16.030 --> 54:18.070
I'm not ready yet.

54:23.369 --> 54:26.409
How can you wait until you\Nget ready at this point?

54:27.880 --> 54:28.880
I...

54:29.409 --> 54:31.050
What do you want from me?

54:32.010 --> 54:33.079
I...

54:34.749 --> 54:35.749
You what?

54:36.320 --> 54:38.150
- I...\N- What?

54:50.900 --> 54:52.729
I think I know\Nwho the arsonist is.

54:58.210 --> 54:59.639
The arsonist? In the\Nmiddle of the night?

54:59.639 --> 55:00.639
If not that,

55:00.780 --> 55:03.809
why would I come call you\Nin this late night?

55:09.550 --> 55:10.690
Who's the arsonist?

55:11.720 --> 55:12.849
It's...

55:27.170 --> 55:28.440
Goodness.

55:29.710 --> 55:30.869
Won Jae.

55:31.309 --> 55:33.510
Have you been playing\Ngames on my phone?

55:44.650 --> 55:46.289
We watched TV.

55:46.289 --> 55:47.789
- We watched TV.\N- We watched TV.

55:47.789 --> 55:48.789
Last...

55:52.490 --> 55:54.630
- Fire!\N- Come here.

55:54.929 --> 55:56.869
- Let's go.\N- Fire!

55:57.729 --> 55:59.229
Come here, guys.

55:59.369 --> 56:00.539
What's he doing?

56:00.900 --> 56:03.010
(Joongjin English School)

56:12.349 --> 56:13.780
- Come here!\N- Hey!

56:13.780 --> 56:15.280
Hey, Won Jae!

56:15.280 --> 56:16.449
Won Jae, come here.

56:16.449 --> 56:18.190
- Won Jae, come.\N- Won Jae.

56:18.190 --> 56:19.190
Can't you hear me?

56:19.220 --> 56:22.059
Won Jae.\NWon Jae, come here.

56:22.059 --> 56:23.429
Won Jae, come here.

56:23.559 --> 56:25.490
Won Jae, hurry.

56:25.490 --> 56:26.499
Come here.

56:41.710 --> 56:43.449
All you need is...

56:43.610 --> 56:46.820
rubbing alcohol, a glass\Nbottle, and a lighter.

56:47.720 --> 56:49.349
The most important thing\Nis a truck.

56:49.849 --> 56:51.590
It has to be...

56:51.590 --> 56:53.289
A glass bottle\Nand a lighter.

56:55.289 --> 56:57.960
I can get rubbing alcohol\Nfrom the pharmacy.

56:59.159 --> 57:01.559
I just have to\Nset the truck on fire.

57:08.300 --> 57:11.039
I'll make sure\Nthis doesn't happen...

57:11.970 --> 57:13.179
ever again.

58:00.220 --> 58:01.659
How much for\Na pack of strawberries?

58:01.659 --> 58:03.389
Eight dollars each.

58:03.389 --> 58:04.630
How about this one?

58:04.630 --> 58:05.829
Is this eight dollars?

58:05.829 --> 58:07.900
Gosh, they look so good.

58:14.970 --> 58:16.470
Okay.

58:21.679 --> 58:23.349
That's 1, 2, 3, 4...

58:49.269 --> 58:51.010
- Goodbye.\N- Goodbye.

58:51.010 --> 58:52.269
Goodbye, little girl.

58:59.780 --> 59:02.380
Darn it,\Nit can't leave already.

59:13.059 --> 59:14.929
Which way is it\Nto block 103?

59:15.360 --> 59:17.499
Okay. Thanks.

59:24.110 --> 59:25.740
You have to wash it.

59:27.309 --> 59:28.409
Hello, Won Jae's mom.

59:28.409 --> 59:29.979
I'm eating it as it is.

59:32.280 --> 59:33.280
Yes.

59:34.220 --> 59:35.349
Won Jae did?

59:41.960 --> 59:44.360
Maybe he wanted to\Ncome and play at my house.

59:45.059 --> 59:46.929
- This is good.\N- Okay.

59:50.599 --> 59:51.869
Okay.

59:52.070 --> 59:53.470
When he gets here,

59:53.740 --> 59:55.099
I'll keep him around.

59:57.610 --> 59:58.809
Watch out!

01:00:16.889 --> 01:00:17.889
Watch out!

01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:52.329
Mom...

01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:54.900

(Queen of Mystery 2)

01:01:22.690 --> 01:01:25.429
If a detective gives up,\Nthe whole world gives up.

01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:27.400
It's not over\Nuntil it's over.

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:28.659
If you meddle...

01:01:28.659 --> 01:01:30.530
with my investigation\Nagain, I'll just...

01:01:30.530 --> 01:01:31.900
Just bite them.

01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:33.639
Don't treat him\Nlike a criminal.

01:01:33.639 --> 01:01:36.409
Won Jae has to learn\Nhow to be responsible.

01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:37.670
I was...

01:01:38.139 --> 01:01:40.280
supposed to study\Nin a place like this.

01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:43.210
I have to make\Ntop 100 today.

01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:46.249
