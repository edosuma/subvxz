02:33.911 --> 02:36.212
- Paulie, how's it look?
- Snitch says the cop's body's...

02:36.214 --> 02:39.815
about 300 yards down
in an abandoned tunnel.

02:39.817 --> 02:42.084
- Howie?
- Right behind you, Captain.

02:42.086 --> 02:44.654
Keep back till I process
the scene, okay?

03:59.870 --> 04:02.304
Watch out!

05:14.448 --> 05:18.618
- So where the hell is the car?
- I don't know.

05:18.620 --> 05:21.399
That's the last time I'm going
to take a goddamn red-eye.

05:21.424 --> 05:22.789
Maybe we can take a cab.

05:22.791 --> 05:25.592
<i>I'm gonna fire</i>
<i>this son of a bitch.</i>

05:25.594 --> 05:27.593
He's always got
an excuse.

05:32.699 --> 05:35.868
<i>Come on. We'll be home</i>
<i>before you know it.</i>

05:35.870 --> 05:37.770
Yeah, okay.

06:17.011 --> 06:21.113
Excuse me. Excuse me. I think
you're going the wrong way.

06:21.115 --> 06:24.583
Excuse me.

06:24.585 --> 06:26.619
Honey?
Honey, wake up.

06:26.621 --> 06:29.455
We're lost, or he's
taking us for a ride.

06:29.457 --> 06:31.557
We're in the middle
of nowhere.

06:31.559 --> 06:34.361
Hey, where the hell are you going?
I said Fifth Avenue.

06:36.898 --> 06:40.467
Hey! We're not
tourists here, man!

06:40.469 --> 06:42.736
Hey! Where are you going?

06:50.511 --> 06:52.379
<i>Let us out. Stop the car.</i>

06:54.315 --> 06:56.516
Stop this car, man!
Can't...

07:06.594 --> 07:08.929
Ah! Shit!

07:08.931 --> 07:12.299
- Oh, my God.
- Son of a bitch!

07:12.301 --> 07:14.668
Stop the goddamn car!

07:16.771 --> 07:18.439
Hey!

07:23.978 --> 07:25.912
- Please!
- Stop the car!

07:25.914 --> 07:26.971
Let us out!

07:26.996 --> 07:30.574
Stop the car, goddamn it!
Stop this car!

07:34.088 --> 07:36.155
<i>Good morning.</i>

07:36.157 --> 07:40.760
You're looking a little dehydrated.
How about some juice?

07:40.762 --> 07:43.062
How about two fingers
of vodka?

07:43.064 --> 07:45.965
A little early for vodka,
don't you think?

07:45.967 --> 07:48.401
Time, as you well know, is a
relative consideration, Thelma.

07:48.403 --> 07:50.836
- Juice.
- Vodka.

07:50.838 --> 07:52.872
- Juice.
- Vodka.

07:52.874 --> 07:54.640
Juice.

07:54.642 --> 07:56.909
- Coming!
- Join me in a drink, Richard?

07:56.911 --> 08:00.746
I'd love to, but a med-tech with
liquor on his breath? I think not.

08:00.748 --> 08:03.516
- <i>Thanks.</i>
- So how are you?

08:03.518 --> 08:06.351
Well, I'm better than
your heart-pacing gear.

08:06.353 --> 08:08.787
Every time I'm here,
it's skewed further out of spec.

08:08.789 --> 08:12.157
- You really need a new unit.
- I really need a new body.

08:12.159 --> 08:15.927
I'm afraid I can't help you with that, but
I'll bring your new unit by tomorrow.

08:15.929 --> 08:16.556
Okay.

08:16.581 --> 08:19.064
This one'll be
stable till then.

08:19.066 --> 08:21.065
- Thank you, Richard.
- You take it easy.

08:21.067 --> 08:24.803
I'll take it any way
I can get it.

08:30.810 --> 08:33.712
- <i>Good morning, Doctor.</i>
- <i>Hi, Richard.</i>

08:33.714 --> 08:36.047
Hey, would you
look at this?

08:36.049 --> 08:38.582
A... peregrine falcon.
Am I right?

08:38.585 --> 08:42.453
Yep. He likes cripples.

08:42.455 --> 08:45.690
There was a piece about them...

08:45.692 --> 08:48.626
in the Times the other day
nesting all over the city.

08:48.628 --> 08:52.797
Something to do with the architecture
of all these old New York buildings.

08:52.799 --> 08:54.699
I thought he liked
my company.

08:59.138 --> 09:02.807
They're a little shy. Uh, don't
take it personally, Barry.

09:02.809 --> 09:05.477
- Can I get you a drink, Doc?
- <i>No, thanks, Thelma. I'm fine.</i>

09:06.846 --> 09:09.181
Bed mode.

09:17.224 --> 09:19.726
- Got vodka in there?
- No.

09:19.728 --> 09:22.229
And you ain't gettin' any,
either.

09:22.231 --> 09:24.498
All right.
I'll let you guys talk.

09:27.702 --> 09:29.804
<i>So, Linc,</i>

09:29.806 --> 09:33.975
you can imagine how much sleep I've gotten
the past few days, considering your request.

09:33.977 --> 09:38.179
That's funny. Since I made my decision,
I've been sleeping like a baby.

09:38.181 --> 09:41.583
After all, you have survived,
beat all the odds.

09:41.585 --> 09:45.186
You know as well as I do there's work
on nerve regeneration every day.

09:45.188 --> 09:48.456
One... finger,
two shoulders and a brain.

09:48.458 --> 09:51.125
That's all I have, Barry.

09:51.127 --> 09:54.262
These dysreflexia seizures
are occurring more frequently.

09:54.264 --> 09:58.466
<i>Buildup of fluid in my spine</i>
<i>is a degenerative condition.</i>

09:58.468 --> 10:00.802
We both know I'm
waiting for the...

10:00.804 --> 10:04.606
seizure that's gonna
make me a vegetable.

10:04.608 --> 10:09.444
I don't want
to be a vegetable, Barry.

10:09.446 --> 10:12.947
I want to make the final
transition on my own terms.

10:15.484 --> 10:19.220
I'll get it done
with or without you.

10:19.222 --> 10:22.924
Oh, yeah? Yeah,
I suppose you would.

10:27.796 --> 10:29.696
So?

10:33.801 --> 10:35.969
- Okay.
- Okay, what?

10:39.907 --> 10:42.475
Okay, I'll assist you...

10:42.477 --> 10:44.845
in your final transition.

10:44.847 --> 10:45.711
<i>What about today?</i>

10:45.736 --> 10:48.048
<i>There are preparations
that have to be made.</i>

10:48.050 --> 10:49.363
<i>This is not a flu shot.</i>

10:49.388 --> 10:51.885
My business is in order.
My bags are packed.

10:51.887 --> 10:56.489
Besides, I've... I've got a medical conference
to go to. I've got a plane to catch.

10:56.491 --> 11:00.460
You're lying.
When do you get back?

11:02.095 --> 11:06.832
- Sunday.
- Okay. Sunday.

11:10.203 --> 11:11.203
I'll see you then.

11:11.211 --> 11:13.997
Get the hell out before
you change your mind.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.944
Don't bother to get up.
I'll show myself out.

11:18.946 --> 11:21.447
Yeah, I'll race you to the door.

11:21.449 --> 11:23.316
<i>Barry.</i>

11:25.686 --> 11:28.221
You are...

11:28.223 --> 11:30.089
<i>a very good friend.</i>

12:20.241 --> 12:22.142
Amelia?

12:23.979 --> 12:26.080
<i>Hey.</i>

12:26.082 --> 12:27.981
Hey. Morning.

12:29.050 --> 12:32.019
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

12:32.021 --> 12:33.920
I just couldn't sleep.

12:37.592 --> 12:40.227
What time is it?
It's early.

12:49.437 --> 12:51.539
I'm gonna be late for work.
I gotta shower.

12:51.541 --> 12:53.541
Come on. No, you don't.
Stay here.

12:53.543 --> 12:55.643
I... I gotta go.

13:07.323 --> 13:12.259
Hey, I'll make breakfast? No, thanks.
I'm gonna be late.

13:12.261 --> 13:14.461
Another
slam-bam-thank-you-ma'am?

13:18.166 --> 13:20.333
All right, look.

13:20.335 --> 13:22.802
My therapist tells me...

13:22.804 --> 13:26.506
I might not be getting what I
need out of this relationship.

13:26.508 --> 13:30.810
<i>Come on. What are we doing here? I
think you and me make a great couple.</i>

13:32.612 --> 13:36.381
You know where I stand on this.
You know what I want.

13:36.383 --> 13:39.618
Steve, we've been through this.

13:39.620 --> 13:42.120
I care about you.

13:42.122 --> 13:44.122
You know that.
I can't make a commitment.

13:53.498 --> 13:56.134
Go to work, then.

13:56.136 --> 13:59.170
<i>You're gonna be late.</i>

14:10.849 --> 14:13.751
So, Amelia, it's true
you're quitting the cops?

14:13.753 --> 14:15.753
No, I'm transferring
to Youth Services.

14:15.755 --> 14:18.489
You lucky fuck. You must have
one hell of a rabbi downtown.

14:18.491 --> 14:21.359
We're gonna miss you in this neighborhood.
3-post-11, here.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.452
<i>Be advised
frightened child at Amtrak site.</i>

14:23.477 --> 14:24.796
I'm a block away.
I'll take it.

14:24.798 --> 14:27.332
Some kid found something
over at the tracks.

14:27.334 --> 14:29.334
Finish eating.
I'll check it out.

14:29.336 --> 14:31.570
- See you, kid.
- All right.

14:57.396 --> 15:00.232
<i>3-post-11,
anything further on that 10-10?</i>

15:00.234 --> 15:02.668
Nothing yet.

15:04.571 --> 15:08.740
<i>Wait. I think I see him. Are you
the one who called the police?</i>

15:52.142 --> 15:54.043
Wait there, okay?

16:59.973 --> 17:03.576
- Are you outta your mind?
- Just shut off the engine, all right?

17:03.578 --> 17:05.578
There's been a homicide.
I can't let you through.

17:19.156 --> 17:21.458
My name's Amelia. What's your name?
Chris.

17:21.460 --> 17:26.262
Chris, hey. I got a job for you.
Here's some money.

17:26.265 --> 17:30.167
I need you to buy me one of
those cheapo cardboard cameras.

17:30.169 --> 17:32.469
The ones you can throw away?
Yeah.

17:32.471 --> 17:34.204
Okay.
Fast as you can.

17:40.645 --> 17:42.546
3-post-11 to Central.

19:33.497 --> 19:35.632
Send a bus. Get those
passengers out of here.

19:35.634 --> 19:38.602
- I saw a hand sticking out...
- Captain Cheney.

19:38.604 --> 19:42.473
Detective Solomon. First officer
on the scene is over there.

19:42.475 --> 19:46.277
<i>I found some strange stuff</i>
<i>on the tracks near the body.</i>

19:46.279 --> 19:48.613
I collected it
before it was washed away.

19:51.883 --> 19:54.385
- I also took some pictures.
- Thanks.

19:54.387 --> 19:56.787
You're the one
that stopped the train?

19:56.789 --> 19:59.523
Yes, sir. I thought it might have
disturbed the physical evidence.

19:59.525 --> 20:02.593
Why not shut down Grand Central
while you're at it, hmm?

20:02.595 --> 20:04.996
Patrolman Donahue?
Is that right?

20:04.998 --> 20:08.399
- Donaghy.
- A rookie, I take it.

20:08.401 --> 20:11.536
- No, sir.
- Pretty dumb.

20:11.538 --> 20:13.772
- <i>Captain?</i>
- <i>Yeah?</i>

20:13.774 --> 20:16.141
- <i>Guess who the vic turns out to be.</i>
- Talk to me.

20:16.143 --> 20:20.479
- Alan fucking Rubin.
- <i>Mr. Rebuild New York himself?</i>

20:20.481 --> 20:22.548
<i>Great.</i>

20:22.550 --> 20:25.618
<i>I don't want anybody entering this
area except for my crime scene guys.</i>

20:25.620 --> 20:27.887
<i>Okay?</i>

20:32.793 --> 20:35.729
Ah.

20:35.731 --> 20:39.199
<i>Knight to H-6. Check.</i>

20:41.202 --> 20:45.138
- You got company. Cops.
- <i>Tell them I'm busy.</i>

20:45.140 --> 20:48.675
- They said it was urgent.
- Tell them I'm out running.

20:48.677 --> 20:51.545
She's too polite for that,
Linc.

20:51.547 --> 20:54.482
<i>Hey! Lookee who's here.</i>

20:54.484 --> 20:58.886
I, uh... I caught
a serious situation, Linc.

20:58.888 --> 21:00.988
Yeah, well, that's
going around, Paulie.

21:00.990 --> 21:03.124
Chief Murphy sent me.

21:03.126 --> 21:05.760
Ah. Good chief.

21:06.519 --> 21:09.130
Have you heard about that
couple at the airport...

21:09.132 --> 21:11.632
got in a taxi
yesterday morning?

21:11.634 --> 21:14.468
- Never made it home?
- He don't watch the news anymore.

21:14.470 --> 21:17.305
You used to read four papers a
day, tape all the news shows.

21:17.307 --> 21:19.575
Now I just hit
the rewind button. A-3.

21:19.577 --> 21:21.877
<i>Things never</i>
<i>change, Paulie.</i>

21:21.879 --> 21:25.047
Yeah, well, that was Alan Rubin
and his wife in that taxi.

21:25.049 --> 21:28.484
<i>Found him dead, buried,</i>
<i>shot in the face.</i>

21:28.486 --> 21:30.853
<i>Hand sticking out of the ground</i>
<i>with his wife's wedding band...</i>

21:30.855 --> 21:34.357
shoved on one of his fingers
which was skinned to the bone.

21:34.359 --> 21:35.572
She's still missing.

21:35.597 --> 21:38.361
Excuse me while you
guys catch up, okay?

21:38.363 --> 21:43.935
Don't go too far, Thelma. We'll be letting
these nice gentlemen out in 30 seconds.

21:43.937 --> 21:47.138
Sounds like you got yourself
an open-and-shut there, Paulie.

21:47.140 --> 21:47.880
I don't think so.

21:47.905 --> 21:50.142
A man worth several
hundred million dollars...

21:50.144 --> 21:54.547
found dead with his wife's wedding
band on his mutilated hand.

21:54.549 --> 21:57.050
What's that tell you?

21:57.052 --> 21:59.652
<i>The doer is saying</i>
<i>he's got her.</i>

21:59.654 --> 22:02.855
He's probably contacting the family
right now, making a ransom demand.

22:02.857 --> 22:06.259
- I'd have been paged if he had.
- <i>Check your batteries.</i>

22:06.261 --> 22:08.595
It's definitely a ransom.

22:10.531 --> 22:13.300
Excuse me. Mr. Rhyme,
Kenneth Solomon.

22:13.302 --> 22:16.103
I've read all your books.
<i>Scene of the Crime...</i>

22:16.105 --> 22:19.106
at least a dozen times.

22:19.108 --> 22:21.709
It's great to actually meet you.

22:21.711 --> 22:23.711
Where do you find
these guys, Paulie?

22:23.713 --> 22:26.113
They wanna work
with the best.

22:26.115 --> 22:29.084
I guess now you're gonna
ask me to...

22:29.086 --> 22:31.086
discuss the crime scene
with you, huh?

22:31.088 --> 22:36.225
As a matter of fact, we've got a bunch of
physical evidence that doesn't make sense.

22:36.227 --> 22:39.294
Some seriously weird stuff.
It's all in the report.

22:39.296 --> 22:42.431
<i>Thelma?</i>

22:42.433 --> 22:44.967
Linc, you okay?

22:46.269 --> 22:48.270
- Hey, Linc, you okay?
- Out, now!

22:48.272 --> 22:51.674
- Anything we can do?
- Asses out of here now!

22:51.676 --> 22:54.945
Let me get you some air.
Breathe for me, Linc.

22:54.947 --> 22:58.148
I said out!

22:58.150 --> 23:02.220
<i>Come on. Deep breaths.</i>
<i>Deep breaths. Come on.</i>

23:02.222 --> 23:04.755
<i>Deep breaths.</i>
<i>I'm getting a B.P. on you.</i>

23:04.757 --> 23:08.993
<i>Come on, Rhyme. You gotta breathe.
Look at me. Breathe.</i>

23:12.531 --> 23:15.734
<i>Look at me. Deep breaths.</i>
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

23:15.736 --> 23:19.471
<i>You gotta take this oxygen. Come on, Rhyme.
Stay with me.</i>

23:19.473 --> 23:22.240
<i>Come on. You can do it.</i>
<i>Don't go out on me, now.</i>

23:22.242 --> 23:24.276
<i>Don't go out.</i>
<i>Come on. Look at me.</i>

23:54.639 --> 23:57.007
- Thelma?
- You okay?

23:57.009 --> 24:01.545
I would be okay if your powers of
resuscitation were a little less adept.

24:01.547 --> 24:05.015
Not on my shift, all right?

24:05.017 --> 24:07.718
If you have a problem with that,
you can just fire my ass.

24:07.720 --> 24:11.221
You know I provide generously for
you in my will. Keep that in mind.

24:11.223 --> 24:16.260
Rhyme, I am not interested in
having this conversation. Okay?

24:16.262 --> 24:20.431
Okay. Crime scene report
Sellitto left.

24:20.433 --> 24:24.001
Would you take those photos, load
them into the viewer for me?

24:24.003 --> 24:26.403
View scan.

24:31.242 --> 24:34.278
Okay. Let's look
at what we got here.

24:35.680 --> 24:39.583
Where it says "location..."
What's that...

24:39.585 --> 24:42.220
What's it say
about that newspaper?

24:42.222 --> 24:47.492
"Newspaper found beneath a coarse-thread
hex-bolt with '4:00 p.m.' circled on it."

24:47.494 --> 24:50.595
"4:00 p.m." Zoom.

24:51.730 --> 24:54.766
<i>Zoom. Zoom.</i>

24:54.768 --> 24:59.037
<i>What about the, uh, that little piece
of paper? What's the number on there?</i>

24:59.039 --> 25:01.707
A torn book page
with 119 on it.

25:01.709 --> 25:05.110
119, 4:00 p.m.

25:05.112 --> 25:08.247
<i>119, 4:00 p.m.</i>
<i>119, 4:00 p.m.</i>

25:08.249 --> 25:10.917
One... One...

25:10.919 --> 25:12.919
Eleven, nine.
What's today's date?

25:12.921 --> 25:15.255
Today's November 9.

25:15.257 --> 25:19.327
Phone mode.
Sellitto, Paulie. Call.

25:24.100 --> 25:25.867
<i>What?</i>

25:27.569 --> 25:31.439
Sad fact is a huge
percentage of inner-city kids...

25:31.441 --> 25:36.678
<i>are having their first drug
experiences at the fifth-grade level.</i>

25:36.680 --> 25:38.846
Now.

25:38.848 --> 25:41.816
Here are some of the drugs
they'll most likely be offered.

25:44.453 --> 25:46.454
Marijuana.

25:46.456 --> 25:50.157
How'd you like to get your
hands on that briefcase?

25:50.159 --> 25:53.393
<i>Barbiturates.</i>
<i>Amphetamines.</i>

25:53.395 --> 25:56.896
Cocaine.

25:56.898 --> 25:58.531
Rock cocaine.

26:08.109 --> 26:11.378
- You wanna tell me what this is about?
- You know who Lincoln Rhyme is?

26:11.380 --> 26:13.880
- Textbook guy?
- Yeah.

26:13.882 --> 26:17.384
- What does that have to do with me?
- We'll find out.

26:19.987 --> 26:22.889
Hey. Come on in.
They're right in there.

26:26.526 --> 26:28.729
And you're saying a
patrol cop took these pictures?

26:28.731 --> 26:31.926
Yeah, first one on the scene.
It started to rain.

26:31.951 --> 26:33.100
Smart cop.

26:33.102 --> 26:36.737
<i>Not only that, but had the balls to stop an
Amtrak from running over the crime scene.</i>

26:36.739 --> 26:39.172
<i>Here she is now.</i>
<i>Officer "Donahoe."</i>

26:39.174 --> 26:42.008
- Meet Lincoln Rhyme.
- Donaghy.

26:46.280 --> 26:50.449
Took some terrific photographs,
Officer.

26:50.451 --> 26:54.286
- You know who I am?
- I read your manual at the academy.

26:54.288 --> 26:58.390
- What'd you think of it?
- I'm not a book critic, sir.

26:58.392 --> 27:00.392
<i>But you found it useful.</i>

27:00.394 --> 27:03.294
- Yeah, I guess so.
- "Guess so." Sure you did.

27:03.296 --> 27:08.199
I mean, you stopped that train.
Photos you took.

27:08.201 --> 27:11.168
I'd say you have a natural
instinct for forensics.

27:11.170 --> 27:15.072
So what do we got, Paulie?

27:15.074 --> 27:18.776
We have footprints, size ten,
thanks to Officer Donaghy...

27:18.778 --> 27:21.412
<i>using a dollar bill</i>
<i>to establish scale.</i>

27:21.414 --> 27:24.515
<i>We have asbestos on a track bed</i>
<i>where there shouldn't be any.</i>

27:24.517 --> 27:27.919
<i>An iron bolt holding down</i>
<i>a, uh, piece of paper.</i>

27:27.921 --> 27:31.256
A book page with 119
written on it.

27:31.258 --> 27:34.394
<i>Decaying oxidation on the bolt's
head but not on the thread,</i>

27:34.396 --> 27:38.064
<i>which says to me that someone
removed it from somewhere else...</i>

27:38.066 --> 27:40.133
<i>and placed it there recently.</i>

27:40.135 --> 27:43.736
<i>Wouldn't you agree, Officer?
Wouldn't you agree, Officer Donaghy?</i>

27:48.375 --> 27:51.445
Paulie, I'm convinced that
this crime scene was staged.

27:51.447 --> 27:54.347
- Perp's trying to tell us something.
- What the fuck are you saying?

27:54.349 --> 27:57.517
Book page 119. 11, 9.
That's today's date.

27:57.519 --> 28:01.088
Newspaper, 4:00 p.m.
What time you got? 12:15.

28:02.190 --> 28:04.091
She's alive, Paulie.

28:04.093 --> 28:07.427
And he's gonna
kill her at 4:00. P.M.

28:09.831 --> 28:13.734
We have your interest yet,
Officer?

28:13.736 --> 28:16.470
I want you
to work the case with us.

28:16.472 --> 28:19.406
Uh, it's not my area.

28:19.408 --> 28:22.710
Are you being modest
or are you...

28:22.712 --> 28:25.212
a little uneasy about doing
some real police work?

28:26.498 --> 28:27.498
Excuse me?

28:27.522 --> 28:30.284
What department you
work in, Officer?

28:30.286 --> 28:33.454
Youth Services Division.
I picked her up at orientation.

28:33.456 --> 28:35.456
Ah, I see.
Youth Services.

28:35.458 --> 28:38.660
I've wait-listed over a year to get that
transfer, and I am not gonna jeopardize...

28:38.662 --> 28:43.097
Jeopardize what?
Cushy desk job?

28:43.099 --> 28:46.401
- Forensics is not my area.
- I disagree with you.

28:46.403 --> 28:48.402
You can't force me
to take this assignment.

28:51.706 --> 28:54.941
- I can.
- And if I refuse?

28:54.943 --> 28:57.310
I would say that you're putting
your career at serious risk.

28:57.312 --> 29:00.613
You think because of your condition you
have the right to push people around?

29:00.615 --> 29:02.782
I'm sorry.
That is truly pathetic.

29:02.784 --> 29:04.850
Truly?

29:04.852 --> 29:07.186
You're damn right, truly.

29:07.188 --> 29:10.489
Well, forgive me, <i>truly,</i>

29:10.491 --> 29:14.560
if I insist on having someone with
your brains and a fresh pair of eyes.

29:14.562 --> 29:17.362
<i>There's a life</i>
<i>at stake here, Officer.</i>

29:17.364 --> 29:20.466
Paulie, we're gonna need some key
people and some tech support.

29:20.468 --> 29:22.468
- Okay?
- I know the guys.

29:22.470 --> 29:24.470
Okay.

29:24.472 --> 29:26.606
What the hell
are you smiling at?

29:36.283 --> 29:38.284
Pull up a chair.

29:38.286 --> 29:42.021
I want you to tell me everything
you know about the crime scene.

29:42.023 --> 29:45.358
Basically, it's all in my report.
I read your report.

29:45.360 --> 29:47.960
I want to know
want you felt,

29:47.962 --> 29:50.430
what you feel...

29:50.432 --> 29:52.832
in the deepest recesses
of your senses.

29:52.834 --> 29:56.603
Why, you really are in love with the
sound of your own voice, aren't you?

29:56.605 --> 29:59.873
Now it's your voice I'm yearning to hear.
Pull up a chair. I won't bite you.

30:28.366 --> 30:31.535
The rifling on the .38 slug
they dug out of the victim...

30:31.537 --> 30:35.406
is consistent with a Webley, a very
old turn-of-the-century handgun.

30:35.408 --> 30:38.476
Thank you, Kenny. On the big board, please.
Paulie, what do you got on that bolt?

30:38.478 --> 30:42.046
There's three initials
on the head... N.S.G.

30:42.048 --> 30:44.682
And the bolt's not steel.
It's iron.

30:44.684 --> 30:47.185
<i>Iron? Iron, iron.</i>

30:47.187 --> 30:50.990
Making it old, like the Webley.

30:50.992 --> 30:53.392
<i>Officer Donaghy, what do you</i>
<i>know about asbestos?</i>

30:53.394 --> 30:56.362
Uh, it kills hard-working
Americans every day.

30:56.364 --> 30:59.086
Very good.
You computer literate?

30:59.111 --> 30:59.933
A little.

30:59.935 --> 31:03.905
Thelma! Thelma?
Where's my Thelma?

31:03.907 --> 31:05.940
<i>Yes.</i>

31:05.942 --> 31:08.276
<i>Thelma, meet Amelia.</i>
<i>Amelia, Thelma.</i>

31:08.278 --> 31:10.645
<i>Amelia hates my books</i>
<i>and also computers,</i>

31:10.647 --> 31:12.647
but she's got an A-plus nose
for evidence.

31:12.649 --> 31:16.952
So I want you to give her a crash
course in how to access D.E.P. files.

31:16.954 --> 31:21.389
<i>Check and see if there's any large asbestos
cleanups going on anywhere in the city, okay?</i>

31:21.391 --> 31:24.359
A.S.A.P.

31:24.361 --> 31:26.762
- Where the hell is Eddie Ortiz?
- <i>I'm right here!</i>

31:26.764 --> 31:29.998
- <i>¿Qué pasa, Paco?</i>
- <i>¿Qué pasa,</i> Eddie?

31:30.000 --> 31:32.466
How's the world's
crankiest criminalist doing?

31:32.468 --> 31:36.137
- Playing beat the clock, you know?
- Everybody's worst nightmare.

31:36.139 --> 31:39.673
You get into a cab, and there's a damn
psycho from Jersey behind the wheel.

31:39.675 --> 31:41.676
We don't know
he's from Jersey.

31:41.678 --> 31:44.446
Yeah, Bayonne. It's the toxins
in the water over there.

31:44.448 --> 31:46.494
What'd you do? Bring
the whole lab with you?

31:46.519 --> 31:48.449
Mama told me "be prepared."

31:48.451 --> 31:51.185
- Where do you want this shit?
- Over here in the corner.

31:51.187 --> 31:54.255
- <i>How is your mother?</i>
- Oh, God. She's 76,

31:54.257 --> 31:57.023
and she's schtupping
some guy named Morris.

31:57.025 --> 31:57.725
God bless her.

31:57.750 --> 32:00.427
But it's Morris the
schtarker I'm worried about.

32:00.429 --> 32:04.130
He's 79 with a tricky ticker
and an active pecker.

32:04.132 --> 32:05.831
Hey.

32:11.971 --> 32:13.134
Afternoon. Captain Cheney.

32:13.159 --> 32:15.640
Amelia, what do
you got on that asbestos?

32:15.642 --> 32:19.210
There's about a dozen cleanups
scattered about the five boroughs.

32:19.212 --> 32:21.245
<i>Put it up on the viewer for me,</i>
<i>will you, please?</i>

32:21.247 --> 32:24.315
<i>See if you can narrow it down to the
oldest location as soon as you can.</i>

32:24.317 --> 32:26.317
- <i>How're you doing, Howard?</i>
- Fine, thank you.

32:26.319 --> 32:27.016
How's it going?

32:27.041 --> 32:29.154
In the middle of the
middle, as you can see.

32:29.156 --> 32:30.083
Mm-hmm.

32:30.108 --> 32:33.791
Hey, Linc, look what I found
on the threading of that bolt.

32:33.793 --> 32:37.961
Huh. I was hoping to grab a minute
with you, if you don't mind.

32:37.963 --> 32:41.831
- Excuse me, Howard.
- Oh. Sorry, sorry.

32:41.833 --> 32:46.369
We got Officer Donaghy here to thank for
photographing the crucial evidence.

32:46.371 --> 32:49.539
Crucial evidence?
We don't know that.

32:49.541 --> 32:53.377
Listen, Linc, I just stopped by to make
sure you had all the support you need.

32:53.379 --> 32:58.015
As you know, I'm putting the full resources
of my department at your... disposal.

32:58.017 --> 33:00.418
And I appreciate it,
Howie. Thank you.

33:00.420 --> 33:02.520
<i>But the thing is, Linc,</i>

33:02.522 --> 33:07.225
you see, I've formalized the department's standard
procedures since you were in charge, so...

33:07.227 --> 33:09.961
Eddie, could you put what you
got up on my screen, please?

33:09.963 --> 33:13.698
<i>So I'd appreciate it</i>
<i>if you kept me in the loop.</i>

33:13.700 --> 33:17.335
- Absolutely.
- At all times.

33:17.337 --> 33:21.539
At all... Eddie, what the hell
is that we're looking at?

33:21.541 --> 33:25.610
<i>Uh, old paper.</i>

33:25.612 --> 33:27.745
<i>Coarse grade.</i>

33:27.747 --> 33:31.382
I'd say, uh,
80, 90 years old.

33:31.384 --> 33:33.718
Turn of the century,
it looks like.

33:33.720 --> 33:36.887
Huh. The perp
likes old.

33:36.889 --> 33:39.690
<i>Uh, fine, then.</i>

33:39.692 --> 33:43.627
Look, I'll be in my office if you need me.
Yeah, okay, Howard.

33:43.629 --> 33:45.629
Good.

33:49.535 --> 33:52.971
Old paper.
Old gun.

33:55.108 --> 33:58.844
<i>Buries his victim in a vintage</i>
<i>Civil War rail road bed.</i>

33:59.946 --> 34:02.648
Sand.

34:02.650 --> 34:06.051
Sand, sand. What... Eddie,
what do you got on the sand?

34:06.053 --> 34:10.688
Doesn't really
look like sand.

34:10.690 --> 34:13.793
- <i>I'm not sure.</i>
- Can you individuate it?

34:13.795 --> 34:16.596
Oh, if I had an E.D.X. here,
I could do anything.

34:16.598 --> 34:19.431
We don't have a goddamn
"E" the fuck "X," Eddie!

34:19.434 --> 34:22.569
Oh, look who forgot their chill
pill this morning. Excuse me.

34:22.571 --> 34:25.672
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>I'm all over this thing now.</i>

34:25.674 --> 34:29.742
Okay, we're talking,
uh, pearly looking.

34:29.744 --> 34:35.181
Some kind of a...
shellfish or something.

34:36.917 --> 34:38.818
Oyster shells maybe?

34:40.388 --> 34:43.657
Could be.

34:43.659 --> 34:46.626
Definitely. If I had to bet
on it, I'd say it was. Sure.

34:50.397 --> 34:53.237
All right, I got it. The
oldest asbestos sites are coming up.

35:23.463 --> 35:28.134
In 1913 when the Woolworth
Building was being built,

35:28.136 --> 35:31.871
workmen found the body of this
rich industrialist, Talbot Soames.

35:31.873 --> 35:35.208
<i>He'd been kidnapped the year before,
shot in the head and buried.</i>

35:35.210 --> 35:38.978
And what they thought was white sand
turned out to be oyster... shells.

35:38.980 --> 35:43.949
Crushed oyster shells. That's what they
used as landfill in lower Manhattan.

35:43.951 --> 35:46.718
<i>That's how Pearl Street got its name.
That's where Mrs. Rubin's gonna be.</i>

35:46.720 --> 35:49.054
Somewhere downtown.

35:49.056 --> 35:51.624
<i>She's gonna be underground.</i>

35:51.626 --> 35:56.796
<i>She's gonna be in a basement... near...
or in the Woolworth Building.</i>

35:56.798 --> 35:59.666
Hey, Paulie.
Call Emergency Services Unit.

35:59.668 --> 36:01.869
Have them meet us
down by the Woolworth Building.

36:01.871 --> 36:04.039
Tell them to start their search.
Maybe we'll get lucky.

36:04.041 --> 36:06.408
Okay? Eddie. Did you bring your van?
Yeah.

36:06.410 --> 36:08.410
Uh, it's downstairs.
<i>We're gonna need it.</i>

36:08.412 --> 36:11.914
Throw your keys to Amelia. Paulie,
you and Solomon go with her.

36:11.916 --> 36:14.016
- Shouldn't I go with them?
- <i>No, you gotta stay here with me.</i>

36:14.018 --> 36:16.852
<i>We gotta work that bolt.</i>
<i>That's the missing piece.</i>

36:16.854 --> 36:20.055
- Shall we keep Cheney in the loop?
- Fuck him.

36:20.057 --> 36:21.824
Fuck him.

36:25.095 --> 36:28.898
<i>Amelia. Trust me.</i>

36:28.900 --> 36:33.603
Follow those instincts you were born with.
I'll be with you...

36:33.605 --> 36:35.606
every step of the way.

36:46.051 --> 36:48.119
Jesus, 25 minutes left.

36:49.855 --> 36:54.259
- How did Rhyme get to be that way?
- He was born brilliant. It happens.

36:54.261 --> 36:57.128
I mean
the physical part.

36:57.130 --> 37:00.131
About four years ago, he was working
the body of a transit cop...

37:00.133 --> 37:03.534
been found shot
in a subway tunnel.

37:03.536 --> 37:07.038
Beam came down, damn near
cut him in half.

37:07.040 --> 37:11.642
Jesus. Family?

37:11.644 --> 37:14.178
Married sister in Phoenix.

37:14.180 --> 37:17.448
He never sees her.
Cut himself off.

37:17.450 --> 37:21.452
Technically, he's still on active
duty, collecting full pay.

37:21.454 --> 37:24.489
P.B.A. insurance picks up round-the-clock
care and all the gadgets.

37:24.491 --> 37:27.759
On weekends, always one or
two cops there lending a hand.

37:27.761 --> 37:31.029
- Tough deal winding up like that.
- You won't hear him complaining.

37:31.031 --> 37:33.499
Nah, he gets too much pleasure
pushing other people's buttons.

37:33.501 --> 37:36.268
In your case,
I'd be complimented.

37:36.270 --> 37:40.440
You gotta learn to relax around a
compliment, especially one from Rhyme.

37:40.442 --> 37:43.075
- You can be a little grating.
- Me?

37:43.077 --> 37:46.479
Kiddo, if you were any more
wound up, you'd be a Timex.

37:51.585 --> 37:54.186
He was a human
dynamo... writing books,

37:54.188 --> 37:58.124
lecturing all over the world,
giving expert opinion in trials,

37:58.126 --> 38:00.159
working half the crime scenes
in the city.

38:00.161 --> 38:03.763
- You know what he'd do in his downtime?
- I can't imagine.

38:03.765 --> 38:06.933
He'd collect things...
dirt, metals, plastics,

38:06.935 --> 38:10.337
hubcaps, plants,
musical strings,

38:10.339 --> 38:12.606
<i>medical tools,</i>
<i>anything you could think of.</i>

38:12.608 --> 38:13.148
Obsessive.

38:13.173 --> 38:15.309
No, he'd have it all
analyzed and catalogued...

38:15.311 --> 38:17.878
for his whatchacallit...
database.

38:19.814 --> 38:23.417
Jesus Christ! I'd like to get
there in one piece, if possible.

38:48.777 --> 38:51.212
New York Security Gate Company.
Start looking through those?

38:51.214 --> 38:52.434
- That might be good.
- What else?

38:52.459 --> 38:53.247
Nicholas Steven Gerard.

38:53.249 --> 38:56.617
- Elevator construction.
- Gotta be underground.

38:56.619 --> 38:58.619
I got a subway builder.
Sounds...

38:58.621 --> 39:01.956
Excuse me! N.S.G.
Niagra Steam Generation.

39:01.958 --> 39:05.226
Bought by Eastern Gas
and Electric in 1928.

39:05.228 --> 39:09.464
The six-inch iron bolt was used
mainly for steam pipe assemblies.

39:50.773 --> 39:54.943
No. No.

39:56.170 --> 39:58.446
349, you got 11 minutes left.
Where are you?

39:58.448 --> 40:01.315
We just hit
the financial district.

40:01.317 --> 40:06.053
There's a steam junction...
with big asbestos-coated pipes.

40:06.055 --> 40:08.956
That's where our victim's gonna be.
I'd bet my legs on it.

40:08.958 --> 40:11.025
She's gonna be
at Wall and Nassau.

40:11.027 --> 40:14.228
- <i>Wall and Nassau.</i>
- Has E.S.U. been notified?

40:14.230 --> 40:16.931
<i>They're on their way. They'll</i>
<i>probably get there before you.</i>

40:16.933 --> 40:21.268
E.S.U. says that steam is released through
that junction every day at 4:00 p.m.

40:21.270 --> 40:24.238
Shit, what's
this asshole up to?

40:24.240 --> 40:27.307
I don't know, but it's gonna happen
in about ten minutes and thirty seconds.

40:27.309 --> 40:30.677
All right, Linc,
we're here. We're going down there.

40:34.514 --> 40:36.582
Amelia?

40:36.584 --> 40:38.684
Yeah, I'm here.

40:38.686 --> 40:42.554
It's their job to try and save Mrs. Rubin's
life. It's your job to get ready and...

40:42.556 --> 40:45.457
<i>work the crime scene,</i>
<i>if necessary.</i>

40:47.426 --> 40:50.461
<i>There's some things you're gonna need.
Look in the back of the truck,</i>

40:50.463 --> 40:56.000
and you'll see an aluminum
suitcase and a radio headset.

40:57.135 --> 41:00.004
- See it?
- <i>Yeah, I see them.</i>

41:21.494 --> 41:25.730
There must be a way in.

41:25.732 --> 41:29.000
- <i>What's the problem here?</i>
- Fuckin' valves freeze up easy.

41:29.002 --> 41:31.068
Come on, guys.
Shut it off.

41:31.070 --> 41:34.706
- You there?
- I'm here.

41:34.708 --> 41:37.676
I'm inside the pipe.

41:42.548 --> 41:44.449
Go!

41:47.219 --> 41:49.921
I hear something!
I hear something!

41:49.923 --> 41:53.125
What is that? Someone's
in there! I can hear her crying.

41:53.127 --> 41:56.828
- Everyone, quiet now!
- Shut all the valves down.

42:06.472 --> 42:10.942
Mrs. Rubin?

42:10.944 --> 42:12.811
<i>Mrs. Rubin?</i>

42:15.281 --> 42:17.449
She's in there, Linc.

42:17.451 --> 42:21.520
<i>Mrs. Rubin,</i>
<i>we're on our way in now!</i>

42:21.522 --> 42:25.256
Come on, guys. Let's go, let's go.
Let's hurry the fuck up.

42:27.927 --> 42:29.069
Get drill and a tap.

42:29.094 --> 42:31.697
Somebody cut this
thing halfway through.

42:31.699 --> 42:33.765
There's no way to
turn that steam off, guys.

42:57.223 --> 42:58.723
Back! Back!

43:32.758 --> 43:35.593
Paulie?

43:35.595 --> 43:37.495
Paulie?

43:41.434 --> 43:44.536
Linc, she's gone.

43:44.538 --> 43:47.339
<i>The whole place</i>
<i>is scalded in steam.</i>

43:47.341 --> 43:49.275
Let's go!
This way!

43:49.277 --> 43:53.346
...is in some way... E.S.U. are gonna
blow a hole in the subbasement wall.

43:53.348 --> 43:55.548
- There's no other way in.
- It's my understanding...

43:55.550 --> 43:58.718
I'm working with Chief Murphy's
authorization on this, right?

43:58.720 --> 43:59.720
Yeah, that's right.

43:59.739 --> 44:02.956
I don't want those Emergency
Services guys rushing in there,

44:02.958 --> 44:06.560
trampling the evidence before we
get a chance to run the scene.

44:06.562 --> 44:07.466
<i>What do you want?</i>

44:07.491 --> 44:10.497
When they blow the hole, I
want Donaghy to go in first.

44:10.499 --> 44:15.268
Hey, come on, Linc. She's not trained for
this. We could get our asses in a sling.

44:15.270 --> 44:18.037
My ass has been in a sling
for four years.

44:18.039 --> 44:21.407
Tell Hanson and his beasts
that's what I want. Period.

44:21.409 --> 44:23.242
<i>All right.</i>
<i>You got it.</i>

44:30.551 --> 44:33.486
Okay, let's move!

44:39.193 --> 44:41.761
All the pipes in the
junction have been secured.

44:41.763 --> 44:43.764
Right. Check
all the way to Broadway.

44:43.766 --> 44:45.732
I'm doing this
under protest, Sellitto.

44:45.734 --> 44:47.768
<i>The perp could still be</i>
<i>in there, for Christ's sake.</i>

44:47.770 --> 44:50.704
Rhyme's in charge,
and they're his orders.

44:50.706 --> 44:54.007
You can't handle it in there,
I want you to get your ass out.

44:54.009 --> 44:56.544
- Amelia, you ready?
- Yeah.

44:56.546 --> 44:59.446
Listen to me.

44:59.448 --> 45:02.116
I'm with you
every step of the way.

45:02.118 --> 45:04.452
Go on.

45:05.454 --> 45:07.354
Good luck.

45:17.866 --> 45:20.167
- <i>I'm in.</i>
- Tell me what you see.

45:28.077 --> 45:30.945
Everything's been boiled to hell.

45:35.751 --> 45:39.454
Oh, God.
 What is it?

45:39.456 --> 45:42.057
It's an awful smell.

45:42.059 --> 45:44.826
That means you're close.

46:07.383 --> 46:11.120
- I can't believe I'm doing this.
- You're fine.

46:11.122 --> 46:16.058
Just fine. You're doing great.
Now just remember the academy.

46:16.060 --> 46:19.562
When you walk,
move in a straight line.

46:19.564 --> 46:22.264
We don't want to disturb
any footprints he might've left.

46:22.266 --> 46:24.667
Yeah, assuming he's gone.

46:32.743 --> 46:36.413
<i>There's no footprints.</i>
<i>There's nothing yet.</i>

46:50.363 --> 46:53.798
Oh, God.

46:53.800 --> 46:56.201
What?

46:56.203 --> 46:58.403
Talk to me.

46:58.405 --> 47:00.438
Talk to me, Amelia.

47:00.440 --> 47:03.475
<i>I can see her.</i>

47:08.414 --> 47:10.849
The steam pipe was opened,

47:10.851 --> 47:13.852
<i>and she's tied down</i>
<i>right in front of it.</i>

47:13.854 --> 47:16.721
Okay. There's nothing
you can do about that now.

47:16.723 --> 47:19.256
You can't do anything for her
but help her by...

47:19.258 --> 47:22.560
working the crime scene;
that's your job.

47:22.562 --> 47:25.197
<i>Open your suitcase.</i>
<i>Get your camera.</i>

48:09.143 --> 48:12.179
- I can't do this.
- You can do it.

48:12.181 --> 48:14.181
Yes, you can. Yesterday
you stopped a train.

48:14.183 --> 48:16.784
You can do anything you want
when you put your mind to it.

48:16.786 --> 48:18.686
Don't work me, Rhyme.

48:25.428 --> 48:27.529
<i>Just tell me</i>
<i>what to do next.</i>

48:27.531 --> 48:30.532
Very slowly, walk the grid...

48:30.534 --> 48:32.735
<i>one foot in front of the other.</i>

48:38.408 --> 48:40.476
I want you
to look around you now.

48:40.478 --> 48:43.513
Remember, crime scenes
are three dimensional.

48:43.515 --> 48:45.482
<i>Floors, walls and ceilings.</i>

48:53.324 --> 48:55.358
- <i>Rhyme.</i>
- Yeah, I'm here.

48:57.762 --> 49:00.831
There's something strange.

49:00.833 --> 49:02.733
Things he left for us?

49:06.771 --> 49:08.805
Yes.

49:08.807 --> 49:10.941
<i>In a cluster again?</i>

49:10.943 --> 49:12.776
<i>There's</i>
<i>a small piece of wood,</i>

49:12.778 --> 49:15.512
<i>and, uh, looks like</i>
<i>some hair.</i>

49:15.514 --> 49:17.648
All right, I'm gonna walk you
through collecting the evidence.

49:17.650 --> 49:19.917
You do everything
exactly as I say.

49:31.496 --> 49:33.731
- Oh, Jesus.
- Talk to me.

49:33.733 --> 49:37.201
- It's a bloody bone.
- <i>Where is it?</i>

49:39.136 --> 49:42.138
It's in my fucking hand.

49:42.140 --> 49:44.040
Human?

49:46.510 --> 49:48.511
I think so, yeah.

49:48.513 --> 49:52.949
All right.
Photograph it. Bag it.

50:10.933 --> 50:14.736
Okay, that's it.
I'm outta here.

50:14.738 --> 50:16.738
One more thing.

50:16.740 --> 50:19.307
We gotta process the body.

50:19.309 --> 50:23.445
Wha... I'm not a medical
examiner. I can't do that.

50:23.447 --> 50:27.682
<i>I'm not asking you to do an autopsy.
I just want you to...</i>

50:27.684 --> 50:29.584
Just describe the restraints.

50:36.559 --> 50:38.460
Okay.

50:43.400 --> 50:45.534
They're strange-looking
handcuffs.

50:45.536 --> 50:47.869
They look more like
old shackles or something.

50:52.608 --> 50:55.510
<i>There's a chain, uh,</i>
<i>across her waist.</i>

50:55.512 --> 50:59.548
<i>And her feet are, uh,</i>
<i>are bound with a rope.</i>

51:02.118 --> 51:05.120
Hands above her head?

51:05.122 --> 51:07.022
Yeah.

51:10.627 --> 51:12.961
<i>There's also a large, uh,</i>
<i>a piece of flesh...</i>

51:12.963 --> 51:16.598
<i>missing from her right forearm.</i>

51:16.600 --> 51:20.134
It's right down to the bone. It looks
like it was surgically removed.

51:21.269 --> 51:23.270
This is
what I want you to do.

51:23.272 --> 51:26.173
We're gonna need
those handcuffs, Amelia.

51:26.175 --> 51:29.810
It's probably our
best chance for good prints.

51:29.812 --> 51:31.912
The M.E. can remove them
when they get here.

51:31.914 --> 51:34.215
M.E. is all thumbs.
They're...

51:34.217 --> 51:36.217
They'll mess up the prints.

51:36.219 --> 51:39.587
Look in the suitcase.
There's a small saw.

51:47.763 --> 51:49.764
Okay.

51:49.766 --> 51:53.167
I want you to saw her hands off
at the wrist line.

51:53.169 --> 51:56.670
We gotta have those cuffs
for prints.

52:18.693 --> 52:20.728
I can't.

52:20.730 --> 52:23.731
Cut her hands off.
We need the handcuffs.

52:23.733 --> 52:25.500
I can't. No.

52:25.502 --> 52:30.204
Saw off her hands.
Take off the cuffs.

52:30.206 --> 52:32.306
- I can't.
- Listen to me.

52:32.308 --> 52:35.010
- Saw off her... We need those cuffs.
- I can't!

52:35.012 --> 52:37.512
- Amelia, we need...
- No! Fuck you!

52:39.882 --> 52:42.317
Amelia. Amelia.

52:47.890 --> 52:50.858
He wants the woman's hands cut off,
he can come and do it himself.

52:57.465 --> 53:01.702
Amelia? Amelia.

53:06.441 --> 53:08.342
Amelia.

53:26.161 --> 53:27.994
<i>That'll be 16.50.</i>

55:49.573 --> 55:52.041
Hello?

55:52.043 --> 55:53.943
Who is it?

56:08.391 --> 56:10.292
Hello?

56:26.476 --> 56:28.944
Jesus.

56:48.697 --> 56:50.898
Hey, hey, take it easy!

56:50.900 --> 56:52.667
<i>Shit! Solomon,</i>
<i>what are you doing?</i>

56:52.669 --> 56:56.904
- Are you okay?
- What the fuck are you doing?

56:56.906 --> 56:59.974
Rhyme's been trying
to call you for hours.

56:59.976 --> 57:02.510
Your phone's down.
He was concerned.

57:02.512 --> 57:06.982
My phone's fine.
I don't need his concern.

57:06.984 --> 57:10.952
He needs you over
to his place right away.

57:10.954 --> 57:15.190
Well, I don't work
for Lincoln Rhyme.

57:15.192 --> 57:18.426
Rhyme believes the evidence you collected
is telling him there's another vic in play.

57:18.428 --> 57:21.496
- And he is laying that at my feet?
- <i>Hey.</i>

57:21.498 --> 57:23.731
Don't shoot the messenger.

57:45.653 --> 57:49.422
- You just move in?
- <i>Uh, yeah, about a year ago.</i>

57:54.195 --> 57:56.096
Really?

58:13.081 --> 58:15.082
You were a model.

58:15.084 --> 58:18.752
- Yeah, when I was a kid.
- Kid model to street cop.

58:18.754 --> 58:20.654
There's a leap.

58:24.258 --> 58:27.359
For whatever it's worth,

58:27.361 --> 58:29.961
I thought what you did today
was pretty damn terrific.

59:13.106 --> 59:16.008
Hey, you guys,
I'm outta here.

59:16.010 --> 59:18.411
I'm gonna grab a cab.
I've got a paper to finish.

59:18.413 --> 59:20.413
I'm just gonna hang.
No problem.

59:20.415 --> 59:22.983
I'll be there
in a minute.

59:22.985 --> 59:25.819
- Can I finish that?
- Go for it.

59:30.493 --> 59:32.560
<i>I'll see you outside.</i>

59:39.367 --> 59:41.201
Taxi.

59:50.879 --> 59:53.815
That bone's definitely not human.

59:53.817 --> 59:56.885
- And the hair?
- Not human either.

59:56.887 --> 59:58.887
<i>Well, what is it?</i>

59:58.889 --> 01:00:01.557
I'm workin'
fast as I can.

01:00:02.826 --> 01:00:05.461
Glad to see
you could join us.

01:00:05.463 --> 01:00:09.065
I got Cheney on the line.
He wants you to brief him.

01:00:09.067 --> 01:00:11.534
Tell him I'll
call him back.

01:00:12.803 --> 01:00:15.705
Two things,

01:00:15.707 --> 01:00:18.508
First, you did a hell of a
job locating the evidence.

01:00:18.510 --> 01:00:22.445
There's no question
the perp knows forensics.

01:00:22.447 --> 01:00:25.515
<i>Now, as for the other</i>
<i>thing, the, uh...</i>

01:00:27.151 --> 01:00:32.055
you know, the victim's
hands, well, maybe, um...

01:00:34.158 --> 01:00:37.928
maybe it was too much to handle,
so we'll just forget it.

01:00:37.930 --> 01:00:42.166
- Is that your version of an apology?
- An apology?

01:00:42.168 --> 01:00:44.702
Is that why you
came over here?

01:00:44.704 --> 01:00:47.038
You really are
a piece of work.

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:48.973
Well, aren't we a pair.

01:00:51.311 --> 01:00:53.578
I think you're terrific.

01:00:57.050 --> 01:01:00.586
You got a hell
of an arrest record too.

01:01:00.588 --> 01:01:05.257
<i>High marks from all your bosses.
Definite gold shield potential.</i>

01:01:05.259 --> 01:01:08.694
Why do you want to throw it all
away to chase youth offenders?

01:01:08.696 --> 01:01:12.031
I don't feel I have any need
to explain that to you.

01:01:12.033 --> 01:01:14.033
Come on, Amelia,
cop to cop.

01:01:14.035 --> 01:01:17.904
Cop to cop, let's just leave
it at personal reasons.

01:01:17.906 --> 01:01:20.073
Okay.

01:01:20.075 --> 01:01:23.310
Doesn't have anything to do
with your father, does it?

01:01:28.416 --> 01:01:31.752
Man, you just keep charging
at walls, don't you?

01:01:31.754 --> 01:01:34.455
Stubbornness is
something we both share.

01:01:35.691 --> 01:01:38.093
You know, they say,
genetically speaking,

01:01:38.095 --> 01:01:40.862
that we come into this world
with a preordained destiny.

01:01:40.864 --> 01:01:43.598
I don't believe it, though.
For example, my parents.

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:46.134
Neither of them had more than
an eighth grade education,

01:01:46.136 --> 01:01:50.204
never read more than one book
between them, not one.

01:01:50.206 --> 01:01:53.118
I've read thousands.
I've written a dozen.

01:01:53.143 --> 01:01:54.675
What's your point?

01:01:54.677 --> 01:01:58.980
My point... is that destiny
is what you make it.

01:02:01.683 --> 01:02:04.952
Whatever happened to your father
doesn't mean it's gonna happen to you.

01:02:04.954 --> 01:02:08.589
<i>You're a great cop. You'll
make a terrific detective.</i>

01:02:09.791 --> 01:02:12.393
It's a gift.

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:14.962
<i>Don't throw it away.</i>

01:02:22.270 --> 01:02:24.338
<i>A report from</i>
<i>the Taxi Commission.</i>

01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:27.242
An NYU student was abducted
late last night.

01:02:27.244 --> 01:02:30.679
His girlfriend saw him struggling
to get out as the taxi driver...

01:02:30.681 --> 01:02:32.514
<i>was bludgeoning him</i>
<i>with a flashlight.</i>

01:02:32.516 --> 01:02:34.516
No description
of the driver.

01:02:34.518 --> 01:02:37.169
Okay, everybody, this
could be our next victim.

01:02:37.194 --> 01:02:38.052
Yeah, Tony.

01:02:38.054 --> 01:02:41.889
<i>Paulie here. It looks like
we got another victim.</i>

01:02:41.891 --> 01:02:45.059
Did you get a deadline
off that evidence yet?

01:02:46.761 --> 01:02:50.164
Not yet. Something I was
hoping you'd help me with.

01:04:10.579 --> 01:04:12.780
No! No!

01:04:12.782 --> 01:04:15.615
No!

01:04:17.185 --> 01:04:21.054
<i>Anyone for some osso buco?</i>

01:04:21.056 --> 01:04:23.290
What?

01:04:23.292 --> 01:04:27.728
The bone we found at the Wall
Street scene... veal shank.

01:04:27.730 --> 01:04:30.063
Braised and overly salted
to boot.

01:04:30.065 --> 01:04:32.166
- A cow bone?
- Uh-huh.

01:04:32.168 --> 01:04:36.169
And I also found a piece
of that old paper...

01:04:36.171 --> 01:04:38.138
<i>embedded in the bone.</i>

01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:41.308
Take a look.

01:04:43.443 --> 01:04:44.443
What's going on?

01:04:44.467 --> 01:04:47.080
Just do what you need to
do as quickly as possible.

01:04:47.082 --> 01:04:49.683
This came in from the F.B.I. It's about the
hair follicles. He says they're not human.

01:04:49.685 --> 01:04:53.453
A rodent, probably a rat. Get
this... they were shaved off.

01:04:53.455 --> 01:04:57.357
Now we're looking for a rat that shaves.
I really like that.

01:04:57.359 --> 01:05:00.327
I've known a few in my time.
How about you, Amelia?

01:05:00.329 --> 01:05:02.195
More than a few.

01:05:02.197 --> 01:05:05.799
It's consistent with underground,
that's for sure, huh?

01:05:05.801 --> 01:05:09.936
What's he trying to say to us? Definitely
communicating in our language.

01:05:09.938 --> 01:05:12.272
Leaving clues.
Forensic clues, at that.

01:05:12.274 --> 01:05:16.309
- Maybe it's a cop.
- Maybe.

01:05:16.311 --> 01:05:19.946
<i>Maybe he's trying to share the
responsibility of these murders with us.</i>

01:05:19.948 --> 01:05:23.249
If we don't figure out the clues
in time, the blood's on our hands.

01:05:23.251 --> 01:05:27.287
<i>And if we don't find the victim in time, we're
as responsible for the murders as he is.</i>

01:05:27.289 --> 01:05:29.890
What do you got on that dirt
you scraped from the wood?

01:05:29.892 --> 01:05:34.728
I don't have it 100 percent individuated,
but it does appear nitrogen-rich.

01:05:34.730 --> 01:05:38.933
- All set. Ready to rock and roll.
- Thanks for rushing, man.

01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:41.269
- <i>All right, Thelma.</i>
- Thank you, Richard.

01:05:41.271 --> 01:05:45.807
Nitrogen-rich. Explosive carbons.
Where do you find those in New York?

01:05:45.809 --> 01:05:49.012
Bomb sites.
Shooting ranges.

01:05:49.014 --> 01:05:51.681
Maybe an old fort
or an armory.

01:05:51.683 --> 01:05:54.984
- Let's not forget the shit factor, guys.
- The what?

01:05:54.986 --> 01:05:57.987
Manure becomes a nitrate
when it's aged.

01:05:57.989 --> 01:06:00.489
That's true.

01:06:00.491 --> 01:06:03.259
And you got
cow bones, huh?

01:06:03.261 --> 01:06:07.096
Old cow bones, old manure.
Turn of the century.

01:06:07.098 --> 01:06:11.300
Cows, farms,
pastures, rats.

01:06:11.302 --> 01:06:14.570
Dead cows.

01:06:14.572 --> 01:06:18.440
Where do you find...
In stockyards.

01:06:18.442 --> 01:06:21.043
Slaughterhouses...
that's what we wanna look for.

01:06:21.045 --> 01:06:23.778
<i>Stockyards and slaughterhouses</i>
<i>from turn of the century.</i>

01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:26.047
- <i>Let's start there.</i>
- Check the Internet.

01:06:26.049 --> 01:06:29.117
Okay, I want tax records,
sanitation records...

01:06:29.119 --> 01:06:32.921
and building code inspections,
last hundred years, okay?

01:07:15.934 --> 01:07:19.136
<i>Your blood pressure</i>
<i>is way up.</i>

01:07:22.241 --> 01:07:25.642
- You're pushing it too hard, Rhyme.
- I understand, Thelma.

01:07:25.644 --> 01:07:28.752
What do we got on the
stockyards over there?

01:07:28.777 --> 01:07:30.548
Almost there.

01:07:30.550 --> 01:07:33.150
- You okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

01:07:33.152 --> 01:07:35.753
I can't figure out
this damn time line...

01:07:35.755 --> 01:07:37.855
or these shards
of cardboard.

01:07:37.857 --> 01:07:40.324
- I don't know what the hell it means.
- Uh, yeah.

01:07:40.326 --> 01:07:43.593
We got three defunct stockyard sites.
There's one on the East Side.

01:07:43.595 --> 01:07:45.362
<i>Lexington and the Harlem
River Viaduct.</i> Good.

01:07:45.364 --> 01:07:49.866
Solomon, put the box down. Mark it down
on the viewer as she calls them off.

01:07:49.868 --> 01:07:53.369
Your blood pressure's gonna blow
a gasket if you don't slow down.

01:07:53.371 --> 01:07:57.440
My body has a mind of its own. It
doesn't listen to me, all right?

01:07:57.442 --> 01:07:59.142
What else, Amelia?

01:07:59.144 --> 01:08:02.879
Yeah, there's another
on the Hudson up at 155th.

01:08:02.881 --> 01:08:06.751
- Mark it down, Solomon.
- Look, your stats are going down.

01:08:06.753 --> 01:08:08.746
<i>You saw him have a
seizure the other day.</i>

01:08:08.771 --> 01:08:09.771
What else?

01:08:09.855 --> 01:08:12.193
There's one underground
at Greenwich and Houston.

01:08:12.218 --> 01:08:13.456
Mark it down, Solomon.

01:08:13.458 --> 01:08:18.661
- Why don't you knock it off, Linc?
- I don't need to knock it off!

01:08:27.837 --> 01:08:30.604
Wh-What was the first one
that you mentioned?

01:08:30.607 --> 01:08:33.008
Lexington and
the Harlem River Viaduct.

01:08:33.010 --> 01:08:35.777
- And when did it close?
- 1910.

01:08:35.779 --> 01:08:39.180
<i>Okay, what about, uh...</i>
<i>Houston and Greenwich?</i>

01:08:39.183 --> 01:08:41.216
- When is that?
- Uh, 1898.

01:08:41.218 --> 01:08:44.953
And Hudson and 155th
was closed in 1906.

01:08:44.955 --> 01:08:47.189
1906, 1898...

01:08:50.292 --> 01:08:52.194
All right.
Let's... 1898.

01:08:54.631 --> 01:08:56.865
Houston and Greenwich.
Call Emergency Services, Paulie.

01:08:56.867 --> 01:09:01.236
Tell 'em... meet us
at Houston and Greenwich, okay?

01:09:01.238 --> 01:09:04.773
Solomon, get on to Hanson.
He'll need about 20 guys.

01:09:06.777 --> 01:09:09.778
- You go with them.
- Come on, guys! Let's go!

01:09:29.196 --> 01:09:31.229
Linc, you there?

01:09:31.232 --> 01:09:33.499
Yeah. Ready.

01:09:33.501 --> 01:09:35.568
<i>We're here.</i>

01:09:35.569 --> 01:09:38.170
Okay. Amelia?

01:09:38.171 --> 01:09:40.238
Yeah.

01:09:40.241 --> 01:09:43.142
All right.
Same drill. I want you in first.

01:09:44.611 --> 01:09:46.578
Let's do it.

01:10:11.473 --> 01:10:13.775
You watch yourself,
Amelia.

01:10:19.515 --> 01:10:21.550
Man, I don't
like this.

01:10:21.552 --> 01:10:23.686
I don't like this.

01:10:26.723 --> 01:10:29.459
Linc, I got a bad feeling
about this, man.

01:10:29.461 --> 01:10:32.662
<i>I think all three of us</i>
<i>ought to get in there together.</i>

01:10:32.664 --> 01:10:34.597
Not yet, Paulie.
Just hold back.

01:10:40.839 --> 01:10:43.339
<i>I'm going down some stairs.</i>

01:10:46.042 --> 01:10:49.011
Cement walls.

01:10:52.150 --> 01:10:55.618
<i>Wood crates.</i>

01:10:55.620 --> 01:10:58.654
<i>Large columns.</i>

01:10:58.656 --> 01:11:02.158
<i>Smells like manure down here.</i>

01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:04.494
<i>Ortiz sure knows</i>
<i>his shit, huh?</i>

01:11:04.496 --> 01:11:07.763
Always has.

01:11:09.566 --> 01:11:12.301
Metal hooks...

01:11:12.303 --> 01:11:15.037
and a pen.

01:11:15.039 --> 01:11:17.106
It's a slaughterhouse.

01:11:30.819 --> 01:11:33.388
- Come on, guys.
- Go, go, go, go!

01:11:35.057 --> 01:11:37.325
E.S.U. are here.
You hold 'em off.

01:11:37.327 --> 01:11:39.895
Don't want 'em
contaminating the scene.

01:11:39.897 --> 01:11:43.832
Hold it. Hold up, hold up!

01:11:43.834 --> 01:11:45.901
You're not to go in.
Why?

01:11:45.903 --> 01:11:49.204
- Rhyme's orders.
- Fuck him! Get me Cheney on the line.

01:11:49.206 --> 01:11:51.740
<i>Crime scene C.O. on air.</i>

01:11:51.742 --> 01:11:54.777
- <i>Switch to channel 22 for E.S.U.</i>
- Fuck Rhyme.

01:12:06.357 --> 01:12:08.359
Maybe this one's
still alive.

01:12:08.361 --> 01:12:10.829
Perp didn't leave
a deadline.

01:12:10.831 --> 01:12:13.098
<i>What does that mean?</i>

01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:15.500
It means we're probably
too late.

01:12:15.502 --> 01:12:18.836
- You don't know that, Rhyme.
- Get off the line.

01:12:20.539 --> 01:12:22.774
Just move on, Amelia.

01:12:25.311 --> 01:12:29.448
You know, there's five basic
contaminants to every crime scene.

01:12:29.450 --> 01:12:32.851
I'll skip to the worst one...
other cops.

01:12:38.591 --> 01:12:40.526
I think
I hear something.

01:12:45.799 --> 01:12:47.700
I hate this shit.

01:12:56.509 --> 01:12:58.377
<i>I see something.</i>
<i>Something's there.</i>

01:13:17.397 --> 01:13:19.631
<i>I think I found him.</i>

01:13:19.633 --> 01:13:22.367
<i>I... I can't tell</i>
<i>if he's alive.</i>

01:13:26.206 --> 01:13:29.042
<i>Oh, geez.</i>
<i>He's covered in rats.</i>

01:13:29.044 --> 01:13:31.477
<i>They're all over him.</i>

01:13:42.123 --> 01:13:44.657
- We're goin' in.
- No, you're not. No, you're not!

01:13:51.232 --> 01:13:52.113
Go, go!

01:13:52.138 --> 01:13:55.425
Central, we have shots fired.
Shots fired.

01:14:04.344 --> 01:14:06.245
Oh, God.

01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:15.687
<i>You were right.</i>
<i>We never had a shot.</i>

01:14:17.023 --> 01:14:20.492
He cut him up pretty bad
and left him for the rats.

01:14:20.494 --> 01:14:24.196
<i>There's also a big cut in his leg.
It's right down to the bone.</i>

01:14:25.698 --> 01:14:27.866
<i>The blood</i>
<i>attracted the rats.</i>

01:14:33.074 --> 01:14:35.374
Goddamn son of a bitch.

01:14:43.583 --> 01:14:45.484
You okay?

01:14:53.660 --> 01:14:57.830
I'm fine. You wanna step aside
so I can walk the grid?

01:15:00.266 --> 01:15:03.069
Yeah. Yeah.
All right.

01:15:03.071 --> 01:15:07.240
Let's back 'em up. Let's give
her some room. Move it, guys.

01:15:07.242 --> 01:15:10.076
<i>Rhyme, I'm gonna walk the grid.</i>

01:15:10.078 --> 01:15:12.078
Okay.

01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:14.948
You know what to do.

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:36.402
Rhyme, I found it.

01:15:36.404 --> 01:15:38.638
<i>Another cluster.</i>

01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:41.774
It's a piece of old paper,
just like the other two.

01:15:41.776 --> 01:15:44.309
<i>And a matchbox.</i>

01:15:44.311 --> 01:15:49.047
Will somebody get that black suitcase
and bring it over here, please?

01:15:49.049 --> 01:15:51.984
<i>Pull out the brown envelope.</i>

01:15:55.255 --> 01:15:58.157
Sounds like you're starting
to enjoy this work.

01:16:04.230 --> 01:16:06.632
Damn!
The press is here.

01:16:09.569 --> 01:16:11.603
Right there,
right there.

01:16:14.909 --> 01:16:19.078
Lincoln Rhyme is no longer working this
case. I'm takin' over. Understood?

01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:23.015
Do what you wanna do, Captain, but maybe
you ought to check with Murphy first.

01:16:23.017 --> 01:16:25.184
Fuck Murphy
and fuck Rhyme.

01:16:25.186 --> 01:16:29.121
This has been cleared downtown.
We got a dead kid in there.

01:16:29.123 --> 01:16:33.092
I, for one, am not taking the heat
for that. You understand, hmm?

01:16:33.094 --> 01:16:36.929
Call Ortiz. Tell him and his crew
to vacate Rhyme's place now.

01:16:36.931 --> 01:16:39.665
Excuse me, but the victim was
already dead when we arrived.

01:16:39.667 --> 01:16:45.171
And you, half-assed patrolman working
a crime scene, those days are over.

01:16:45.173 --> 01:16:47.373
I'll take that evidence bag
now, thank you.

01:16:47.375 --> 01:16:50.075
You can take it with a chain
of custody voucher, sir.

01:16:52.579 --> 01:16:54.714
Are you outta your mind?

01:16:54.716 --> 01:16:58.078
<i>Cheney says he
wants all the evidence.</i>

01:16:58.103 --> 01:16:58.919
Hmm?

01:16:58.921 --> 01:17:01.555
Let's go. You're coming with us.

01:17:01.557 --> 01:17:03.624
<i>What, are you arresting me?</i>

01:17:03.626 --> 01:17:08.096
Just get in the car and
keep your mouth shut to the press.

01:17:21.178 --> 01:17:24.246
You're not gonna find any prints.
The guy's too good for that.

01:17:31.854 --> 01:17:36.291
Well, it looks like we have a
nice, clean friction print here.

01:17:36.293 --> 01:17:39.527
Unless, of course,
it's yours.

01:17:39.529 --> 01:17:42.163
No. I was wearing gloves
when I collected it.

01:17:42.165 --> 01:17:46.434
We'll know soon enough. Put
this through, highest priority.

01:17:46.436 --> 01:17:48.436
- <i>You got it.</i>
- Thank you.

01:17:59.015 --> 01:18:03.017
Hey, you know, I got a feeling this
perp's been in business a long time.

01:18:03.019 --> 01:18:06.321
Yeah, I hear you, but that's
Cheney's problem now.

01:18:06.323 --> 01:18:09.824
Yeah, that's what scares me.
Do me a favor, will you?

01:18:09.826 --> 01:18:12.994
Check and see if there's been any
homicides in the last 12 months...

01:18:12.996 --> 01:18:15.663
involving surgically removed
flesh exposing bone.

01:18:18.066 --> 01:18:21.669
No problem.
I'll see you soon.

01:18:21.671 --> 01:18:23.872
- Hope so, Eddie.
- <i>Hey, Thelma?</i>

01:18:23.874 --> 01:18:26.734
Don't you let him run no
circles around you now.

01:18:26.759 --> 01:18:28.100
Stay right, Eddie.

01:18:46.730 --> 01:18:51.600
Oh, that print. We just got
a positive I.D. on it.

01:18:51.602 --> 01:18:55.704
The guy has three
extremely violent priors.

01:18:55.706 --> 01:18:59.375
Oh, look at that.
Taxi license, no less.

01:18:59.377 --> 01:19:03.712
We got him. Let's go, boys!
Somebody call E.S.U.

01:19:21.467 --> 01:19:24.902
Now slide out
nice and easy.

01:19:37.449 --> 01:19:39.750
That explains
your print, Captain.

01:19:42.321 --> 01:19:45.156
He's now the
fourth victim of a killing spree...

01:19:45.158 --> 01:19:47.439
that has prompted NYPD brass
to launch a task force...

01:19:48.395 --> 01:19:50.462
<i>to track the killer.</i>

01:19:50.464 --> 01:19:55.300
<i>This morning's raid follows leads found
in one of the earlier murder sites.</i>

01:19:55.302 --> 01:19:57.302
- Hey!
- Hey.

01:19:57.304 --> 01:19:59.805
I was hoping
you'd show up.

01:19:59.807 --> 01:20:02.641
He's been worried about you.

01:20:02.643 --> 01:20:05.177
- ...Lincoln Rhyme.
- Yeah, sure.

01:20:05.179 --> 01:20:07.746
Viewers will know Rhyme
from his book, Scene of the Crime,

01:20:07.748 --> 01:20:11.617
<i>a chronicle of old New York's
most grisly murders...</i>

01:20:11.641 --> 01:20:12.118
Hey.

01:20:12.119 --> 01:20:15.119
<i>I didn't expect</i>
<i>to see you again.</i>

01:20:15.121 --> 01:20:17.888
Poor Cheney, huh?

01:20:17.890 --> 01:20:21.125
Grabbed the ball with both hands
and scored one for the other team.

01:20:21.127 --> 01:20:23.293
I can't comment at
this time... Yeah.

01:20:23.295 --> 01:20:27.297
I tried to warn him that the perp
was too smart to leave a print.

01:20:27.299 --> 01:20:30.133
How you doin' with that stuff?

01:20:30.135 --> 01:20:32.301
<i>Not too good.</i>

01:20:32.303 --> 01:20:36.106
<i>Two pieces of the puzzle,</i>
<i>but I don't know what it means.</i>

01:20:38.176 --> 01:20:40.276
Maybe this'll help.

01:20:40.278 --> 01:20:42.612
Cheney will have
your badge for that.

01:20:42.614 --> 01:20:46.282
<i>He wouldn't give me a chain of
custody voucher, so what could I do?</i>

01:20:46.284 --> 01:20:49.352
You could bring it
back to him.

01:20:49.354 --> 01:20:52.055
The man is a living monument
to ineptitude.

01:20:52.057 --> 01:20:54.591
True.
Let's take a look.

01:20:54.593 --> 01:20:56.960
<i>What do you got there?</i>

01:20:58.562 --> 01:21:01.164
<i>Ah! Third piece</i>
<i>of the puzzle.</i>

01:21:01.166 --> 01:21:04.067
There's something
really strange about it.

01:21:04.069 --> 01:21:05.969
You gotta smell it.

01:21:08.506 --> 01:21:10.540
Sure.

01:21:10.542 --> 01:21:12.943
Are you...
Oh, shoot.

01:21:17.883 --> 01:21:20.451
Sorry.

01:21:20.453 --> 01:21:22.687
It's okay.
Take your time.

01:21:28.426 --> 01:21:30.627
Okay.

01:21:33.532 --> 01:21:36.667
You have to put it
closer to my nose.

01:21:38.537 --> 01:21:41.839
What do you think it is?

01:21:43.074 --> 01:21:45.109
Kerosene?

01:21:47.647 --> 01:21:49.647
Possibly.

01:21:49.649 --> 01:21:52.216
This just came in
from Eddie Ortiz.

01:21:52.218 --> 01:21:55.386
Amelia, could you load these
into the viewer, please? Shit!

01:21:55.388 --> 01:21:57.955
Sorry about that,
Thelma.

01:21:57.957 --> 01:22:00.625
E.C.U.

01:22:02.663 --> 01:22:06.064
"Dear Linc, I'm enclosing photos

01:22:06.066 --> 01:22:08.734
"which took place
in the last 12 months."

01:22:08.736 --> 01:22:12.338
"Flesh has been surgically removed
from each of the victims' extremities."

01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:14.707
"I miss you.
Love, Eddie."

01:22:14.709 --> 01:22:17.571
I'm gonna spare myself the
pleasure, if you don't mind.

01:22:17.596 --> 01:22:18.835
<i>Okay, Thelma.</i>

01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:22.348
<i>Zoom.</i>

01:22:24.818 --> 01:22:26.886
Same mark.

01:22:26.888 --> 01:22:28.855
<i>Right.</i>

01:22:28.857 --> 01:22:32.525
<i>Zoom. Zoom.</i>

01:22:33.593 --> 01:22:35.628
<i>Zoom.</i>

01:22:38.431 --> 01:22:40.365
Same messages.

01:22:43.970 --> 01:22:45.936
<i>It's him.</i>

01:22:45.938 --> 01:22:49.706
The perp was trying
to make contact even then.

01:22:51.209 --> 01:22:53.710
But Cheney never
put it together.

01:22:58.217 --> 01:22:59.983
Thelma!

01:22:59.985 --> 01:23:02.552
Dysreflexia seizure,
a bad one.

01:23:02.554 --> 01:23:05.055
Hang on. Hang on, Rhyme. Breathe now.

01:23:05.057 --> 01:23:09.159
Come on. Breathe with me.
Damn catheter's blocked.

01:23:09.161 --> 01:23:13.863
<i>Let me get a B.P. on you. Stay with me.
Stay with me. Breathe!</i>

01:23:13.865 --> 01:23:16.733
Hang on. Hang on. Just let me check it.

01:23:18.970 --> 01:23:22.372
<i>Diastolic's over 125.</i>
<i>I gotta get it down now.</i>

01:23:27.712 --> 01:23:30.446
<i>Just give it</i>
<i>a few seconds to work.</i>

01:23:30.448 --> 01:23:33.483
<i>Come on, breathe with me.
Breathe with me, Rhyme. Rhyme?</i>

01:23:33.485 --> 01:23:35.618
<i>Rhyme! Rhyme!</i>

01:23:37.888 --> 01:23:40.890
Come on.

01:23:42.059 --> 01:23:44.060
Hang on, Rhyme.
Hang on.

01:23:44.062 --> 01:23:46.629
Is he gonna
make it?

01:23:46.631 --> 01:23:50.466
If he does,
he won't be happy.

01:23:50.468 --> 01:23:53.236
What... What are you
talking about?

01:23:53.238 --> 01:23:57.006
He's already finalized
arrangements to self-terminate.

01:24:00.577 --> 01:24:03.313
He's convinced
some doctor friend to help...

01:24:03.315 --> 01:24:06.984
with his "final transition,"
as he calls it.

01:24:06.986 --> 01:24:10.387
But suicide? I mean...
It's the seizures.

01:24:10.389 --> 01:24:14.692
Any one of 'em could put him
into a vegetative state.

01:24:14.694 --> 01:24:17.963
<i>That's what he fears</i>
<i>more than anything.</i>

01:24:19.933 --> 01:24:22.869
Who is it?

01:24:22.871 --> 01:24:26.539
- Captain Cheney!
- What can I help you with?

01:24:26.541 --> 01:24:29.276
Police business.
Open up, please.

01:24:29.278 --> 01:24:31.445
Mr. Rhyme is asleep.

01:24:31.447 --> 01:24:34.948
Well, wake him up.
I need to see him now.

01:24:37.885 --> 01:24:40.653
Let me deal with this asshole Cheney.
You watch him.

01:24:40.655 --> 01:24:43.156
Anything, just call me.
He's all right.

01:24:51.232 --> 01:24:53.400
Look, lady.

01:24:53.402 --> 01:24:57.503
Now, I hope you know that obstructing
justice is a felony offense.

01:24:57.505 --> 01:25:00.539
Look, don't "lady" me.
And I know my rights.

01:25:00.541 --> 01:25:03.030
<i>Unless you have a warrant,
you can't come in.</i>

01:25:03.055 --> 01:25:03.842
<i>I'm comin' in.</i>

01:25:03.844 --> 01:25:08.513
I have reason to believe there's
stolen evidence on these premises.

01:25:08.515 --> 01:25:11.149
<i>Now, what's</i>
<i>your full name, hmm?</i>

01:25:11.151 --> 01:25:13.584
<i>Thelma what?</i>

01:25:13.586 --> 01:25:17.788
You want to get official, huh?
What did you say your name was?

01:25:17.790 --> 01:25:21.759
All right. I'm not here
to play the name game, honey.

01:25:21.761 --> 01:25:24.862
You got a smart mouth, and it's
gonna get you in trouble one day.

01:25:24.864 --> 01:25:28.766
Yeah, and it also may bite your ass if you
don't stop trying to aggravate my patient.

01:25:28.768 --> 01:25:31.769
I'm gonna leave now,
but I'll be back.

01:25:31.771 --> 01:25:34.705
And when I come back,
it'll be with a warrant.

01:25:50.790 --> 01:25:55.526
I looked everywhere, and I thought
the conductor was gonna be so angry.

01:25:55.528 --> 01:26:01.198
I kept on searching everywhere, and
finally it was right on my lap.

01:26:05.471 --> 01:26:07.872
Grandma can't wait
to see you.

01:27:01.628 --> 01:27:03.696
What'd I do?

01:27:03.698 --> 01:27:06.699
First off, you're carrying a
fare and your meter's not on.

01:27:06.701 --> 01:27:09.803
Number two, your license is
not displayed...

01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:15.603
There's laws against molesting
the handicapped, you know.

01:28:18.106 --> 01:28:20.007
Yeah?

01:28:23.545 --> 01:28:26.513
I wasn't a pretty sight,
was I?

01:28:31.552 --> 01:28:34.954
Thelma told me about your plans
for your "final transition."

01:28:39.727 --> 01:28:42.929
Cop to cop, that subject's
not open to discussion.

01:28:45.065 --> 01:28:47.400
Why, would you miss me?

01:28:47.402 --> 01:28:51.737
Well, destiny's
what we make it, right?

01:28:53.206 --> 01:28:54.413
Touché.

01:28:54.438 --> 01:28:56.242
You seem to have your
reasons for checking out.

01:28:56.244 --> 01:29:00.513
I just... I would've expected
more from someone like you.

01:29:00.515 --> 01:29:05.586
Well, I might surprise you
and... live forever.

01:29:05.588 --> 01:29:08.282
Nothing you could do would
surprise me, Rhyme.

01:29:08.307 --> 01:29:08.956
<i>Well!</i>

01:29:08.958 --> 01:29:11.641
Look who's still in
the land of the living.

01:29:11.666 --> 01:29:12.860
For the moment.

01:29:12.862 --> 01:29:15.796
<i>Cheney was here,</i>
<i>huffin' and puffin'.</i>

01:29:15.798 --> 01:29:18.832
- Promised to return with a warrant.
- Sorry I missed him.

01:29:20.836 --> 01:29:23.904
- If that's him, tell him I'm, uh...
- Say no more.

01:29:23.906 --> 01:29:25.973
<i>Skiing.</i>

01:29:25.975 --> 01:29:30.244
Hello? Oh, hey, Paulie.
Hang on.

01:29:30.246 --> 01:29:33.080
Linc, I don't know if this is
anything more than a coincidence,

01:29:33.082 --> 01:29:36.783
but a taxi inspector was killed today
by a cabbie who was off the meter.

01:29:36.785 --> 01:29:40.621
Thing about this taxi, a witness... a
male, who wouldn't give his name...

01:29:40.623 --> 01:29:44.725
saw the taxi speeding away with an
old man and a little girl inside.

01:29:44.727 --> 01:29:48.462
- Probably the doer that called.
- Jesus, he's got a kid.

01:29:48.464 --> 01:29:50.765
And an old man.

01:29:50.767 --> 01:29:52.767
<i>- Thank you, Paulie.
- Okay.</i>

01:29:52.769 --> 01:29:56.971
We better take a closer look at
that third piece of the puzzle.

01:29:56.973 --> 01:29:58.973
Close.

01:29:58.975 --> 01:30:02.109
Three murders.
Three evidence clusters.

01:30:03.679 --> 01:30:06.447
Three pieces of paper.

01:30:06.449 --> 01:30:08.483
View scan.

01:30:20.931 --> 01:30:23.999
Come on, Thelma. You're the queen
of puzzles. What do you see?

01:30:25.535 --> 01:30:27.837
I'm looking.
I'm lookin'.

01:30:27.839 --> 01:30:32.174
What if we lower
the little one, that one?

01:30:36.546 --> 01:30:39.348
Twist that big one around.

01:30:50.327 --> 01:30:55.732
Doesn't that kind of look like a face?
Mouth, nose, eye.

01:30:55.734 --> 01:30:58.501
Enhance.

01:30:58.503 --> 01:31:00.370
<i>Fade.</i>

01:31:02.139 --> 01:31:04.674
That's a woman's face.

01:31:06.410 --> 01:31:08.611
Yes, it is.

01:31:08.613 --> 01:31:11.414
<i>It's a logo.</i>

01:31:11.416 --> 01:31:13.750
An old,

01:31:13.752 --> 01:31:15.852
turn-of-the-century...

01:31:15.854 --> 01:31:17.820
publisher's logo.

01:31:17.822 --> 01:31:20.156
You know it?

01:31:20.158 --> 01:31:24.227
I used to own a few of the books.
Gothic stories.

01:31:25.663 --> 01:31:27.764
Crime stories.

01:31:27.766 --> 01:31:31.601
<i>The killer is pointing us</i>
<i>to an old book.</i>

01:31:57.026 --> 01:31:59.428
Can I help you?

01:32:02.932 --> 01:32:06.401
I called before about
turn-of-the-century crime books.

01:32:06.403 --> 01:32:08.636
Around the corner.
Help yourself.

01:32:08.638 --> 01:32:10.705
Thanks.

01:33:29.189 --> 01:33:31.624
Aviation Two to Central.

01:33:31.626 --> 01:33:34.393
We're taking a flyby
at the Brooklyn Bridge.

01:33:34.395 --> 01:33:38.564
The report appears
unfounded at this time.

01:33:38.566 --> 01:33:41.801
<i>Will proceed to check East
River shoreline and advise.</i>

01:33:41.803 --> 01:33:45.304
I need more small boats over
here to search under the piers.

01:33:45.306 --> 01:33:47.974
It's by the heliport.
Under the piers.

01:33:47.976 --> 01:33:50.977
Lincoln, it was
the last murder in the book.

01:33:50.979 --> 01:33:54.146
- They've got to be along the shore here.
- Listen.

01:33:54.148 --> 01:33:57.583
The lab says the odor we smelled on
the third piece of the puzzle...

01:33:57.585 --> 01:33:59.685
is probably diesel fuel.

01:33:59.687 --> 01:34:04.022
There's an old boat refueling station
at the Staten Island ferry pier.

01:34:04.024 --> 01:34:06.324
Check the pilings
under the pier.

01:34:53.070 --> 01:34:56.438
Found them!
Over here!

01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:59.642
Here! Here!

01:34:59.644 --> 01:35:02.912
Central, I can see someone
with a light signaling us...

01:35:02.914 --> 01:35:05.748
<i>from the old</i>
<i>Staten Island ferry pier.</i>

01:35:05.750 --> 01:35:08.884
<i>There appears to be two bodies in
the water next to the pilings.</i>

01:35:16.059 --> 01:35:19.962
Subject signaling is most likely
NYPD officer at the site. Come on.

01:35:25.035 --> 01:35:28.237
Over here! Here!

01:35:35.312 --> 01:35:38.247
Watch the pilings!

01:35:40.450 --> 01:35:43.519
We've got divers
coming in to you now.

01:35:46.089 --> 01:35:49.224
Come over to the ladder.

01:35:52.461 --> 01:35:55.730
Central, be advised
aideds are out of the water...

01:35:55.732 --> 01:35:59.067
and E.S.U. is working
on them at this time.

01:35:59.069 --> 01:36:01.537
<i>Choppers on standby.</i>

01:36:05.009 --> 01:36:07.109
Rhyme, you there?

01:36:07.111 --> 01:36:10.612
Yeah. <i>Looks like we're too late.</i>

01:36:10.614 --> 01:36:13.348
Uh-uh, forget it.
He's dead.

01:36:13.350 --> 01:36:16.085
<i>Bring the chopper in.</i>

01:36:16.087 --> 01:36:18.287
The old man is gone.

01:36:18.289 --> 01:36:21.624
<i>They're still working on the little
girl, but it doesn't look good.</i>

01:36:23.729 --> 01:36:26.163
We need a Task Level
One mobilization, okay?

01:36:26.165 --> 01:36:28.865
Let's try it again. I know she's
still there. Come on, kid.

01:36:28.867 --> 01:36:31.734
Come on. Try it.

01:36:31.736 --> 01:36:34.638
Breathe. Come on.
You can do it.

01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:36.873
<i>Come on.</i>

01:36:36.875 --> 01:36:40.343
<i>Breathe. Breathe.</i>

01:36:42.614 --> 01:36:44.547
<i>There you go!</i>

01:36:44.549 --> 01:36:47.384
She's breathing.
I think she's gonna be okay.

01:36:47.386 --> 01:36:49.486
Can you hear me?

01:36:49.488 --> 01:36:53.357
- <i>I think she's gonna make it.</i>
- Good. Good.

01:36:53.359 --> 01:36:57.995
You gotta find the clues
that he left for us, Amelia.

01:36:57.997 --> 01:37:01.599
See what you can find
around the fuel tanks.

01:37:01.624 --> 01:37:02.624
All right.

01:37:25.857 --> 01:37:28.559
Lincoln, I found it.

01:37:28.561 --> 01:37:31.027
<i>It's a map of some kind,</i>

01:37:31.029 --> 01:37:35.632
<i>some chunk of a clean bone and
a piece of a metal or a badge.</i>

01:37:38.135 --> 01:37:40.871
<i>There are some initials engraved.
It looks like a...</i>

01:37:40.873 --> 01:37:44.608
a "P" and a "B," or a...

01:37:44.610 --> 01:37:47.377
<i>It's a "D."</i>
<i>It's definitely a "D."</i>

01:37:47.379 --> 01:37:50.280
P-D. It sounds
like a cop's badge.

01:37:50.282 --> 01:37:53.117
You think
he's gonna kill a cop?

01:37:53.119 --> 01:37:55.886
Could be.

01:37:57.122 --> 01:37:59.024
- Thelma.
- Maps?

01:38:00.727 --> 01:38:02.795
Tell me about the map.

01:38:02.797 --> 01:38:05.464
Looks like
an old subway map.

01:38:05.466 --> 01:38:08.267
<i>I don't recognize</i>
<i>any of the stations.</i>

01:38:09.769 --> 01:38:12.738
When I was scanning those
asbestos sites, I came across...

01:38:12.740 --> 01:38:15.607
<i>a lot of stations</i>
<i>that aren't in use anymore.</i>

01:38:15.609 --> 01:38:18.710
Okay, there it is,
the oldest station.

01:38:18.712 --> 01:38:23.549
<i>On your map, is there an old station
indicated at the tip of Manhattan?</i>

01:38:26.086 --> 01:38:30.255
<i>- Navy Street.</i>
- It's right next to the pier.

01:38:30.257 --> 01:38:33.592
<i>Oh, shit.</i>
<i>Cheney's here.</i>

01:38:38.766 --> 01:38:41.701
You talking to Rhyme on that thing?
Give me the radio!

01:38:43.470 --> 01:38:47.273
Yeah, listen, Linc. This is Cheney, man.
What the hell you doin'?

01:38:47.275 --> 01:38:50.175
<i>Stealing evidence is a goddamn felony.
You know that.</i>

01:38:50.177 --> 01:38:53.112
To my understanding, there's
no chain of evidence voucher.

01:38:53.114 --> 01:38:57.749
<i>Yeah? I got news for you. You are not
a cop anymore. You understand that?</i>

01:38:57.751 --> 01:39:00.686
<i>What you are is</i>
<i>a fucking meddling cripple.</i>

01:39:00.688 --> 01:39:03.856
I'm going to place
your gofer here under arrest.

01:39:03.858 --> 01:39:06.659
<i>You don't mind that,</i>
<i>do ya?</i>

01:39:06.661 --> 01:39:09.061
Lock her up!

01:39:10.230 --> 01:39:12.264
Where'd she go?

01:39:37.025 --> 01:39:39.326
I'm inside
the Navy Street tunnel.

01:39:39.328 --> 01:39:42.230
<i>There's grey dust everywhere.</i>
<i>It's all over my shoes.</i>

01:39:48.404 --> 01:39:52.007
<i>There's footprints,</i>
<i>one set of footprints.</i>

01:39:52.009 --> 01:39:55.244
Hello, Lincoln. Hello?

01:39:55.246 --> 01:39:57.846
Amelia? Hello?

01:39:57.848 --> 01:40:00.182
The mobile unit
you've called is not responding,

01:40:00.184 --> 01:40:02.651
- or is outside the coverage area.
- Recall.

01:40:05.789 --> 01:40:07.823
<i>God.</i>

01:41:03.747 --> 01:41:06.749
<i>No dust.</i>
<i>He changed the numbers.</i>

01:41:07.951 --> 01:41:10.786
7-8-4-9-9.
What is it?

01:41:10.788 --> 01:41:13.222
7-8-4-9-9.

01:41:14.625 --> 01:41:16.859
What does it mean?

01:41:16.861 --> 01:41:20.029
What does it mean?
7-8-4-9-9.

01:41:24.669 --> 01:41:26.770
<i>7...</i>

01:41:26.772 --> 01:41:29.339
8-4... 9-9.

01:41:36.514 --> 01:41:38.882
<i>Help me, Rhyme.</i>
<i>Help me.</i>

01:41:54.399 --> 01:41:57.367
He's gonna kill Rhyme.

01:42:19.727 --> 01:42:21.660
Coming.

01:42:26.733 --> 01:42:29.901
Hey. What are you
doing here?

01:42:49.924 --> 01:42:51.958
Thelma?

01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:54.427
<i>Is that Amelia?</i>

01:42:57.264 --> 01:42:59.165
Bed mode.

01:43:06.507 --> 01:43:09.843
Thelma?

01:43:16.985 --> 01:43:20.287
Thelma, is that you?

01:43:26.294 --> 01:43:29.762
No, it's me... Richard.

01:43:29.764 --> 01:43:32.598
Richard. What's up?

01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:36.802
Thelma asked me to come by,
check the heart pacing machine.

01:43:39.806 --> 01:43:42.607
Oh.

01:43:45.312 --> 01:43:49.180
<i>Uh... where is Thelma?</i>

01:43:49.182 --> 01:43:51.816
Out in the hall.

01:44:09.034 --> 01:44:11.536
Phone mode.

01:44:19.946 --> 01:44:24.083
I thought it was time we had a little
quiet moment together, you and I,

01:44:24.085 --> 01:44:26.052
<i>no interruptions.</i>

01:44:26.054 --> 01:44:29.054
Okay. What's on
your mind, Richard?

01:44:29.056 --> 01:44:32.725
I think it's time to set the
record straight, Mr. Rhyme.

01:44:32.727 --> 01:44:35.461
Syracuse.

01:44:35.463 --> 01:44:38.030
You remember Syracuse,
don't you?

01:44:38.032 --> 01:44:40.833
You wrote
an expert opinion.

01:44:40.835 --> 01:44:42.969
I've written thousands
of opinions, Richard.

01:44:42.971 --> 01:44:46.406
Don't fucking tell me
you don't remember Syracuse.

01:44:46.408 --> 01:44:49.809
<i>They called it an investigation.
It was a witch-hunt.</i>

01:44:49.811 --> 01:44:54.313
<i>There was a forensics cop</i>
<i>up in Syracuse, New York...</i>

01:44:54.315 --> 01:44:56.482
Marcus Andrews.

01:44:56.484 --> 01:44:59.585
Okay, yeah, that was
the cop that was...

01:44:59.587 --> 01:45:03.021
suspected of tampering with evidence
in some homicide cases, right?

01:45:03.023 --> 01:45:04.110
Nothing was tampered with.

01:45:04.135 --> 01:45:06.492
Six innocent people went
to jail; one hung himself.

01:45:06.494 --> 01:45:10.329
No, no, no. They went to jail because
they were guilty, they were scum.

01:45:10.331 --> 01:45:12.331
<i>He doctored</i>
<i>the serology reports.</i>

01:45:12.333 --> 01:45:13.415
No, nothing was doctored.

01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:15.667
<i>He planted blood evidence
at the crime scenes.</i>

01:45:15.669 --> 01:45:18.303
My work was impeccable.

01:45:19.572 --> 01:45:23.275
Where we going with this...

01:45:23.277 --> 01:45:25.277
Marcus?

01:45:29.416 --> 01:45:31.784
Your report
destroyed my life.

01:45:31.786 --> 01:45:34.120
You know my report
was not a legal finding.

01:45:34.122 --> 01:45:36.523
You never gave me the
opportunity to defend myself.

01:45:36.548 --> 01:45:37.724
I never even met you.

01:45:37.726 --> 01:45:40.426
I was sent to prison
for six years.

01:45:40.428 --> 01:45:43.329
I spent two more years
trying to get to you.

01:45:43.331 --> 01:45:46.032
Do you know what happens
to a cop in jail?

01:45:46.034 --> 01:45:49.669
Every day,
every single day,

01:45:49.671 --> 01:45:52.739
over and over,
I was brutalized.

01:45:52.741 --> 01:45:56.142
I became a human toilet,
because of your expert opinion.

01:45:56.144 --> 01:46:00.146
Well, you will never point the finger
of blame at anyone ever again.

01:46:03.451 --> 01:46:06.853
You were never as good as they
said you were. I played you.

01:46:06.855 --> 01:46:10.022
<i>I tested you.</i>
<i>I gave you every clue.</i>

01:46:10.024 --> 01:46:12.625
You and your little helper
couldn't save those people.

01:46:12.627 --> 01:46:14.994
Their blood is on your hands.
You failed.

01:46:14.996 --> 01:46:16.996
You failed, you fuck.

01:46:16.998 --> 01:46:20.832
Game of chess, Mr. Rhyme. Some
people win, some people lose.

01:46:20.834 --> 01:46:23.736
I win, Mr. Rhyme. I win, you lose.

01:46:27.108 --> 01:46:31.643
<i>What kind of vegetable would you
like to be, Mr. Rhyme? A carrot?</i>

01:46:34.848 --> 01:46:37.248
How about a zucchini?

01:46:38.484 --> 01:46:40.785
<i>Zucchini?</i>

01:46:40.787 --> 01:46:43.921
- You want to be a zucchini?
- Thelma!

01:46:43.923 --> 01:46:47.958
<i>I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.
Did you say zucchini?</i>

01:47:25.730 --> 01:47:28.199
<i>You want to play?</i>

01:47:39.546 --> 01:47:42.515
Shall we cut out
your tongue, Mr. Rhyme?

01:47:44.051 --> 01:47:46.552
How about your eye?
Your eye.

01:47:46.554 --> 01:47:50.656
I'll just pop it right out of there.
No, let's leave that for now...

01:47:50.658 --> 01:47:52.658
so you can watch me.

01:47:52.660 --> 01:47:57.163
You can watch me while I gut you
open right down the middle.

01:48:00.602 --> 01:48:02.802
What?

01:48:06.307 --> 01:48:08.941
What?

01:48:08.943 --> 01:48:11.010
What?

01:48:41.442 --> 01:48:43.610
Lincoln?

01:48:43.612 --> 01:48:46.946
Lincoln.
Can you hear me?

01:48:46.948 --> 01:48:48.949
Lincoln.

01:48:48.951 --> 01:48:51.418
Oh, God.

01:48:53.154 --> 01:48:55.956
- Two more in here.
- Step aside, ma'am.

01:49:49.008 --> 01:49:53.011
- I've always loved this view.
- I like it, too, Doc.

01:49:53.013 --> 01:49:56.881
It's looking better
every day.

01:49:56.883 --> 01:49:58.884
Hey, how you guys doin'?

01:49:58.886 --> 01:50:00.886
Good.

01:50:00.888 --> 01:50:03.989
Ho-ho, ho, ho, ho-ho!

01:50:03.991 --> 01:50:06.324
Ho-ho, ho, ho-ho!

01:50:06.326 --> 01:50:09.061
Hey, Linc! You got an
operating license for that?

01:50:09.063 --> 01:50:11.663
I got a learner's permit.

01:50:11.665 --> 01:50:13.698
<i>Mami, mira</i> Lincoln.
<i>Feliz Navidad.</i>

01:50:13.700 --> 01:50:15.534
<i>¿Cómo estás?</i>

01:50:15.536 --> 01:50:17.903
<i>Mira.</i>

01:50:17.905 --> 01:50:20.739
- How's your boyfriend Morris?
- He's in Florida.

01:50:20.741 --> 01:50:23.008
He play golf.
Playing golf?

01:50:23.010 --> 01:50:25.044
- <i>Captain Flash on wheels.</i>
- Yo, Paulie.

01:50:25.046 --> 01:50:27.213
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, everyone.

01:50:27.215 --> 01:50:30.884
Linc, if you gonna be cruisin',
you might as well be amusin'.

01:50:30.886 --> 01:50:33.554
- There you go.
- Thank you, Eddie.

01:50:33.556 --> 01:50:35.823
It's nice.
<i>Qué bonito.</i>

01:50:37.359 --> 01:50:39.360
Hey.
Come on in.

01:50:39.362 --> 01:50:41.796
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:50:41.798 --> 01:50:44.899
<i>- Merry Christmas.
- How you doin'?</i>

01:50:44.901 --> 01:50:48.103
- You're looking real good, Mr. Rhyme.
- "Mr. Rhyme"?

01:50:48.105 --> 01:50:51.673
It's Lincoln to you.
Loosen your shorts.

01:50:54.210 --> 01:50:56.644
Oh, my goodness!

01:50:56.646 --> 01:50:59.714
Oh, my goodness! Merry Christmas.
What are you doing here?

01:50:59.716 --> 01:51:02.850
- Merry Christmas, Uncle Linc.
- Oh, give me a kiss.

01:51:02.852 --> 01:51:05.519
Merry Christmas, Kimmy.
How are you?

01:51:05.521 --> 01:51:09.390
How you doin', Tony? My goodness, I didn't
know you were gonna make this trip.

01:51:09.392 --> 01:51:12.060
Wouldn't be a surprise
if you knew.

01:51:12.062 --> 01:51:14.529
I'm sorry. Amelia, this is my
sister Janine, her family.

01:51:14.531 --> 01:51:17.198
- Amelia.
- Yeah, I know. Hi.

01:51:17.200 --> 01:51:19.901
- You know?
- We've met.

01:51:19.903 --> 01:51:22.804
On the phone.
How you doin'?

01:51:25.474 --> 01:51:28.243
Merry Christmas, Lincoln.

01:51:38.654 --> 01:51:40.555
