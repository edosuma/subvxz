00:09.310 --> 00:13.480
When I was little,
my father was famous.

00:14.890 --> 00:18.450
He was the greatest samurai
in the Empire.

00:19.660 --> 00:22.630
He was the Shogun's decapitator.

00:23.370 --> 00:29.650
He cut out the head of 131
lords for the Shogun.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.590
It was a bad time
for the Empire.

00:40.590 --> 00:46.840
The Shogun just stayed inside this
castle, and he never came out.

00:47.710 --> 00:51.010
People said his brain
was infected by devils

00:52.090 --> 00:55.180
And Daddy's is brought in with evil.

00:56.030 --> 01:00.080
The Shogun said his
people were not loyal.

01:07.820 --> 01:10.250
He said he had a lot of enemies,

01:10.350 --> 01:13.290
but he killed more people than that.

01:20.040 --> 01:22.290
It was a bad time.

01:22.570 --> 01:25.880
Everybody's living in fear.

01:32.160 --> 01:34.640
But still we were happy.

01:35.910 --> 01:38.390
My father would come home to mother,

01:38.490 --> 01:43.120
and when he sees her,
he would forget about the killings.

01:43.800 --> 01:48.030
He wasn't scared of the Shogun,
but the Shogun was scared of him.

01:48.180 --> 01:49.200
Husband ...

01:49.640 --> 01:52.740
Maybe that was the problem.

01:55.820 --> 01:56.850
Azami.

02:00.930 --> 02:02.960
I had a bad dream.

02:03.860 --> 02:05.050
Don't be afraid.

02:06.140 --> 02:08.190
Bad dreams are only dreams.

02:10.139 --> 02:13.500
What a time you chose to be born,
Daigoro !

02:18.750 --> 02:21.970
At night, mother
would sing for us.

02:22.020 --> 02:25.900
My father would go into the temple
and pray for peace,

02:26.640 --> 02:30.070
He prayed for things to get better.

02:30.730 --> 02:33.120
Then one night ...

02:36.040 --> 02:40.760
The Shogun sent his
ninja spies to our house.

02:44.320 --> 02:46.750
They're supposed to kill my father

02:48.360 --> 02:50.010
But they didn't.

02:56.600 --> 03:00.190
That was the night everything changed.

03:00.770 --> 03:02.850
Forever.

03:03.210 --> 03:04.180
Azami ...

03:10.020 --> 03:14.060
Azami, your dream has come true!

03:14.170 --> 03:16.250
Dai ... Daigoro ...

03:16.250 --> 03:20.200
You must protect our son.

03:24.430 --> 03:26.040
They will pay

03:28.910 --> 03:31.060
In rivers of blood.

03:37.820 --> 03:42.500
That was when my father
left his samurai life

03:42.590 --> 03:44.980
and became a demon.

03:46.340 --> 03:49.020
He became an assassin,

03:49.260 --> 03:52.430
who walks on the road of vengeance.

03:54.830 --> 03:58.020
And he took me with him.

04:00.000 --> 04:06.074

04:07.910 --> 04:10.830
I don't remember most of it myself.

04:14.640 --> 04:17.769
I only remember the Shogun's ninjas

04:18.430 --> 04:21.350
hunting us wherever we go.

04:21.940 --> 04:24.030
And the bodies falling ...

04:24.760 --> 04:26.170
And the blood.

04:53.970 --> 04:56.060
You are marching toward death

04:56.700 --> 04:58.640
wherever you go,

04:58.890 --> 05:03.710
you cannot escape the Shogun.

05:30.920 --> 05:33.890
My father hardly ever talks anymore.

05:34.380 --> 05:38.060
We just go a little farther everyday.

05:38.710 --> 05:41.190
At night, we make a fire,

05:42.070 --> 05:43.630
have our tea

05:44.320 --> 05:46.600
and we listen for the ninjas.

05:47.090 --> 05:49.530
We never make a sound.

05:50.500 --> 05:53.270
Sometimes he tells me about the past

05:53.760 --> 05:55.560
and about mother.

05:56.920 --> 05:58.970
I try not to think about it

06:01.690 --> 06:04.130
but my father can't
help it.

06:06.080 --> 06:08.300
Sometimes he gets lost

06:09.140 --> 06:10.750
in the past.

06:18.540 --> 06:19.610
Daigoro.

06:21.020 --> 06:24.480
I have decided to escape

06:25.450 --> 06:27.450
and defy the Shogun.

06:27.690 --> 06:30.810
Today I will begin walking the road to hell.

06:31.100 --> 06:33.490
But you will choose
your own path.

06:52.380 --> 06:53.500
So ...

06:54.670 --> 06:57.200
soon you may be seeing heaven.

06:58.850 --> 07:00.430
Choose the sword

07:00.610 --> 07:02.850
and you will join me.

07:04.500 --> 07:06.060
Choose the ball

07:06.500 --> 07:09.320
and you'll join your mother
in death.

07:09.760 --> 07:12.920
You do not understand my words,
but you must choose.

07:25.630 --> 07:26.650
Come, my boy.

07:27.040 --> 07:28.850
Choose life or death.

08:12.520 --> 08:15.200
Your mother would be happy.

08:17.290 --> 08:19.970
My own son will defy the Shogun.

08:21.090 --> 08:23.420
You are my child.

08:28.150 --> 08:30.390
Assassin with son.

08:36.809 --> 08:38.909
By order of our lord Shogun,

08:38.909 --> 08:41.730
in the name of Emperor Gonigi,
son of heaven.

08:41.780 --> 08:43.679
You now have two choices:

08:43.730 --> 08:46.060
Swear eternal loyalty to your master,

08:46.060 --> 08:48.690
or commit harakiri
with your son.

09:03.100 --> 09:04.510
You are wrong.

09:04.810 --> 09:06.800
I have a third choice.

09:13.330 --> 09:14.690
You mad man!

09:14.790 --> 09:16.150
We command you!

09:20.580 --> 09:23.550
He defies the Shogun's orders!
Guards!

09:24.280 --> 09:26.280
Seize him! Stop him!

09:27.400 --> 09:29.200
What are you waiting for? Kill him!

09:29.250 --> 09:31.830
Can't you see he's a devil?
Kill him!

10:37.750 --> 10:41.990
You fool, bow
before your Shogun.

10:42.770 --> 10:45.060
We see you are trapped.

10:46.080 --> 10:48.610
You can never escape

10:49.000 --> 10:50.270
your fate:

10:51.140 --> 10:54.600
some death with honor in duel

10:54.700 --> 10:58.170
with my son, Lord Kurando.

10:59.470 --> 11:01.300
Why don't you accept?

11:03.120 --> 11:04.380
If you win,

11:04.530 --> 11:08.330
the Shogun will not
challenge you anymore to come back.

11:08.770 --> 11:09.790
How about it?

11:09.790 --> 11:13.980
Accept this offer

11:14.220 --> 11:16.940
or die here

11:16.940 --> 11:18.360
now.

11:20.940 --> 11:23.860
Defeat my son
in a fair fight

11:23.910 --> 11:26.540
and you will win your freedom.

11:29.410 --> 11:30.820
I agree.

11:41.140 --> 11:45.330
My son Kurando, the massacrer

11:45.570 --> 11:48.220
and his little bastard.

11:50.050 --> 11:53.750
My strategy will not fail

11:54.090 --> 11:56.560
What's his karma!

11:57.840 --> 12:00.730
Sun in the heavens

12:01.010 --> 12:04.510
blind the eyes of this mad wolf.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.870
Fly, Kurando, my boy.

12:07.970 --> 12:10.360
Fly to glory.

13:05.320 --> 13:07.810
Sometimes we come to a town,

13:08.290 --> 13:09.900
but it is bad for us.

13:10.050 --> 13:12.580
Because we are
not like other people.

13:13.020 --> 13:15.310
The towns are dangerous.

13:15.890 --> 13:19.200
The Shogun's ninjas are
everywhere.

13:20.170 --> 13:21.440
Our rooms are nice,

13:21.930 --> 13:23.780
and we have hot baths.

13:24.120 --> 13:26.410
Anybody could be a ninja

13:26.940 --> 13:30.110
Even a pretty girl
or a nice lady.

13:30.500 --> 13:32.540
And you never know who.

13:33.530 --> 13:34.580
Hey.

13:36.630 --> 13:38.290
Oh, how cute!

13:39.360 --> 13:42.770
Oh, merci? Thank you very much. Thank you.

13:44.470 --> 13:47.090
Can I roll it out to the back?

13:48.120 --> 13:50.800
This way inside, please, thank you.

13:50.800 --> 13:53.430
But sometimes you have to take a chance,

13:53.910 --> 13:55.910
if you want to take a bath.

13:57.610 --> 13:59.610
Let's rinse your feet.

14:00.880 --> 14:01.950
There.

14:02.530 --> 14:03.260
Matsu!

14:03.600 --> 14:04.520
Yes?

14:06.380 --> 14:09.150
Matsu! Why show your kindness to this guy?

14:09.540 --> 14:11.070
You let that man in here!

14:11.070 --> 14:12.510
It's just the kind of beggars!

14:12.510 --> 14:13.730
Oh I too can see!

14:13.730 --> 14:16.510
But don't you realize he's
a masterless samurai?

14:16.850 --> 14:18.370
They reek of troubles!

14:18.940 --> 14:20.890
If he doesn't pay,
he'll become violent.

14:21.230 --> 14:23.320
This person involves first of us.

14:45.570 --> 14:48.010
Sorry, sire, there's been a mistake,

14:48.400 --> 14:49.470
we have no...

14:49.470 --> 14:51.020
Can I pay now?

14:51.510 --> 14:53.360
And, would you keep this for me?

14:54.770 --> 14:56.820
One thousand pieces of gold.

14:56.820 --> 14:58.570
Oh, so much?

14:59.640 --> 15:01.100
I hope it's enough.

15:01.250 --> 15:04.460
Thank you very much, I am honored.
Thank you.

15:08.460 --> 15:10.510
Matsu, idiot servant!

15:11.670 --> 15:13.130
We must wash their feet.

15:15.270 --> 15:18.050
Oh, a strong little samurai boy!

15:18.530 --> 15:20.140
I'll wash your feet.

15:30.360 --> 15:31.440
Thank you.

17:23.970 --> 17:25.460
Can we go?

17:44.500 --> 17:46.910
Mostly, we just keep moving.

17:47.610 --> 17:49.370
It's safer that way.

17:50.340 --> 17:52.730
That's how I get my education.

17:53.410 --> 17:55.160
Just seeing things

17:55.600 --> 17:59.420
and always watching out for ninjas.

18:00.470 --> 18:02.550
Sometimes I fall asleep,

18:03.340 --> 18:05.430
but my father never does.

18:06.480 --> 18:10.400
That's good, because one time
when I was sleeping,

18:10.500 --> 18:13.470
the Shogun sent his
soldiers for me.

18:17.950 --> 18:20.040
Assassin, show yourself!

18:20.040 --> 18:23.160
This is Lord Bizen
your old comrade.

18:23.160 --> 18:25.250
I bring a message from my father,

18:25.250 --> 18:26.910
your former master.

18:27.440 --> 18:31.290
You have won your liberty,
but not your son's.

18:32.260 --> 18:36.550
Your son's life will be
payment for your foul crimes.

18:36.840 --> 18:41.220
The slow death of your son
will be an example to all men.

18:42.730 --> 18:43.900
Where is he?

18:44.820 --> 18:46.280
Turn him over!

18:51.980 --> 18:55.530
Prepare to witness his agony.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.760
He is the son of a mad wolf.

19:13.940 --> 19:15.110
Kill him!

19:48.510 --> 19:52.210
Bizen, my son, you fool!

19:52.500 --> 19:55.960
The wolf lured you to your grave.

19:56.780 --> 20:00.580
But I will risk the life
of all my sons

20:00.630 --> 20:04.720
to see his head on a stake.

20:10.800 --> 20:13.240
Farewell, my son.

20:20.830 --> 20:21.760
You!

20:22.000 --> 20:25.700
Listen to me, Lone Wolf.

20:27.250 --> 20:32.130
I want your head now.

20:32.180 --> 20:33.590
You can not kill me.

20:33.690 --> 20:36.900
By my eternal vow I will destroy you!

20:37.290 --> 20:43.130
You and your son are cursed

20:43.180 --> 20:45.370
for evermore!

20:46.440 --> 20:49.800
Bring your ninjas.
I will kill them all!

20:53.750 --> 20:58.570
I, Lord Kuragawa and
my ninja group greet you.

21:00.810 --> 21:05.040
We are here to report
the Shogun's wishes.

21:05.330 --> 21:10.010
My ninja women exists
to serve our master's move.

21:10.110 --> 21:12.980
We hunt a man
called Lone Wolf

21:13.130 --> 21:16.190
who fought a duel with our Shogun's heir.

21:16.680 --> 21:19.060
What was the outcome of this duel?

21:19.840 --> 21:21.160
Terrible.

21:25.930 --> 21:27.050
Traitor!

21:32.310 --> 21:35.760
Tell, please.
What can we do?

21:36.200 --> 21:40.000
We have orders to kill him,
it won't be easy.

21:40.970 --> 21:42.320
You fool!

21:42.630 --> 21:46.520
Maybe Lone Wolf
would only toy with you.

21:48.420 --> 21:50.030
May you want to see?

22:13.740 --> 22:15.250
These are your men?

22:15.350 --> 22:16.320
Yes.

22:17.490 --> 22:19.830
Show me your strongest man.

22:22.160 --> 22:23.670
Junai.

22:50.300 --> 22:52.640
Junai, find the way from the room.

22:53.130 --> 22:54.000
Yes.

22:54.930 --> 22:57.120
Try to escape from the room.

24:04.130 --> 24:11.130
This is your best man?
Lone Wolf would swallow him!

24:25.630 --> 24:27.920
My women will execute him.

24:51.440 --> 24:55.220
Always on the road, we stop
a lot at temples,

24:55.430 --> 24:57.870
to pray for the souls of the dead.

25:03.270 --> 25:08.820
That's how Kupel can find
my father.

25:10.670 --> 25:12.950
And they hire us to kill someone

25:13.400 --> 25:15.780
they are scared to kill themselves.

25:16.950 --> 25:21.670
They put up pictures of
a wolf on their temple gates.

25:28.250 --> 25:30.970
My father leaves a message.

25:46.750 --> 25:48.990
Then we meet in secret.

26:22.830 --> 26:24.970
Message... road side...

26:25.940 --> 26:29.200
Lone Wolf must be near.

26:45.370 --> 26:48.390
I am Hirado, local clan's chief.

26:49.170 --> 26:52.010
We hear you will kill
a man for money.

26:52.010 --> 26:56.860
They call me Lone Wolf,
assassin with son.

26:57.830 --> 26:59.970
In fact they say that..

27:00.510 --> 27:05.140
But you have to show me who you are,
something to assure me.

27:49.730 --> 27:51.920
The Shogun must have sent him.

27:56.740 --> 27:58.400
Is it enough proof?

28:02.140 --> 28:04.090
Tend to him.

28:35.890 --> 28:38.180
Assassin fees in advance.

28:38.620 --> 28:39.980
Bring the money.

28:55.660 --> 28:57.310
Check, please.

28:57.800 --> 29:00.820
1000 pieces of gold.

29:11.970 --> 29:14.110
We need your help.

29:14.300 --> 29:18.880
The men of our clan are proud
and dare to defy the Shogun

29:19.030 --> 29:21.110
who's taxing us without mercy.

29:21.110 --> 29:25.280
He takes 2/3 of our harvest,
and still think we cheat him!

29:25.550 --> 29:29.740
That is why he has sent
his fanatical brother, Lord Kiru,

29:29.740 --> 29:33.730
to infiltrate our brothers
with many ninja spies.

29:41.670 --> 29:44.830
The Shogun's brother's methods

29:44.880 --> 29:50.820
His ninja scours terrorize our people
by night with his supreme torturous  methods.

29:50.960 --> 29:55.520
Even now, they are probably
report him to Kiru.

29:55.520 --> 30:01.340
But even worse, now the Shogun
is sending special escorts by ship

30:01.430 --> 30:03.860
to bring Lord Kiru
safely home.

30:04.010 --> 30:07.470
Three brothers are called
the "Masters of Death".

30:08.250 --> 30:10.120
There are few who heard of them.

30:10.440 --> 30:12.680
One brother uses the claws.

30:13.800 --> 30:16.380
Another fight with a club.

30:17.260 --> 30:19.980
The third uses nailed fists.

30:23.200 --> 30:26.020
Together, they've killed many men.

30:26.560 --> 30:29.720
We beg you, kill Lord Kiru

30:29.720 --> 30:32.740
before they escort him across our borders.

30:32.840 --> 30:37.610
You have our unworthy prayer
for the success of your mission.

30:42.450 --> 30:46.230
We hope you will not fail.

30:47.660 --> 30:50.950
The future of our clan
depends on you

31:08.860 --> 31:10.910
When we're on the mission,

31:11.350 --> 31:16.850
I keep count of how many ninjas
my father killed.

31:16.860 --> 31:18.940
He says not to keep count

31:18.940 --> 31:21.720
Always to pray for
their souls.

31:23.110 --> 31:24.930
But if I don't keep count,

31:25.200 --> 31:27.660
I don't know how many
souls to pray for.

31:28.240 --> 31:30.190
So I keep count.

31:38.080 --> 31:41.580
So far it's 342.

32:13.160 --> 32:16.930
34 ... 5

33:34.830 --> 33:36.530
Daigoro!

35:30.950 --> 35:33.140
I am the Supreme Ninja!

41:01.680 --> 41:04.990
Father, are you cold?

41:11.080 --> 41:12.880
We've met Lone Wolf.

41:13.080 --> 41:16.390
Now may I suggest you put
your troops against him.

41:17.170 --> 41:21.650
He fought and killed
all but two of them!

41:26.810 --> 41:32.940
So what happened to your swordsmen
will happen to you too, next?

41:33.910 --> 41:38.440
Sorry, but your women are
all dead.

41:39.560 --> 41:43.260
This is intolerable.
He intimidated you.

41:43.900 --> 41:48.740
Don't worry, we are very
sure he'll lose his power

41:48.740 --> 41:50.470
when he's without his son.

41:50.910 --> 41:55.390
So you see, the little boy
is the way to him.

46:30.320 --> 46:31.640
Daigoro ...

47:41.550 --> 47:44.480
Prepare to die, Lone Wolf!

47:55.190 --> 47:56.790
Shameless cheat!

48:01.660 --> 48:04.580
You torture my boy.

48:05.150 --> 48:07.600
The well is very deep.

48:08.280 --> 48:11.500
Surrender now, or your
boy will drown.

48:14.270 --> 48:16.170
Cheer up, Lone Wolf.

48:17.050 --> 48:18.700
I refuse.

48:21.280 --> 48:23.670
It is a certain death.

48:24.970 --> 48:27.950
Throw away your sword.

48:34.960 --> 48:39.540
Kill him if you dare.
It doesn't weaken me.

48:41.590 --> 48:43.630
My son and I ...

48:44.120 --> 48:47.090
already have embraced our fate.

48:48.260 --> 48:52.390
Almost too heroic for one
without another son.

48:52.690 --> 48:55.710
In the sight of death,
my son will not give up.

48:56.970 --> 48:59.410
Ninja, now you shall see ...

49:00.420 --> 49:02.720
You will wish you have been wiser.

49:03.150 --> 49:04.270
Daigoro.

49:05.630 --> 49:08.460
Soon you'll stand by your mother's side.

49:11.090 --> 49:12.360
Understood?

51:20.790 --> 51:22.060
Daigoro.

52:01.300 --> 52:05.540
That was the first time
I ever saw my father

52:05.640 --> 52:07.920
spare the life of an enemy.

52:09.380 --> 52:11.280
He should have killed her,

52:12.010 --> 52:13.570
but he didn't.

52:15.230 --> 52:18.250
Maybe it's the way she looked at him

52:19.580 --> 52:23.070
Maybe she reminded him of someone.

52:34.600 --> 52:39.670
To find the Shogun's brother,
we had to take a ship.

52:39.810 --> 52:41.230
It was fun.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.600
But there are too many people
on the ship.

52:45.360 --> 52:47.750
Too many dangerous people.

53:40.140 --> 53:43.350
All aboard!

53:43.450 --> 53:47.540
All new passengers, get out
your money, please!

54:14.610 --> 54:15.780
Rebels.

54:18.800 --> 54:22.150
The Shogun has many enemies.

56:20.860 --> 56:24.800
Get rid of them, or the same
will happen to you.

56:24.900 --> 56:25.650
Yes.

56:25.660 --> 56:26.700
Now!

56:26.840 --> 56:27.670
Yes!

56:54.640 --> 56:56.200
With son?

57:13.100 --> 57:15.530
Masters of Death ...
Scum!

57:17.790 --> 57:19.130
Let me off at the next stop!

57:19.130 --> 57:21.320
- Don't worry! I'll be the one they ha...
- Let me off!

57:21.320 --> 57:23.180
- Do not do something!
- Do something!

57:23.180 --> 57:24.400
Please!

57:56.670 --> 57:58.770
It makes me sick!

57:58.960 --> 58:02.630
Those swines will butcher anyone
who walks in their way.

58:02.630 --> 58:04.950
It's just bad taste.

58:06.650 --> 58:10.690
Never mind.
They'll never make it to shore.

58:10.790 --> 58:12.500
I will see to that!

58:33.240 --> 58:38.490
Sorry to bother you.
Will you return my knife?

59:36.720 --> 59:38.570
Very strange.

59:39.450 --> 59:43.250
These cases are filled with oil
disguised as soy sauce.

59:43.930 --> 59:46.320
Someone plans to burn the ship?

59:54.200 --> 59:57.080
Scums drinking sake!

59:57.810 --> 01:00:00.190
I'll teach you to hurt
innocent people like that.

01:00:01.850 --> 01:00:03.840
Good. Stay below.

01:00:55.210 --> 01:00:59.200
Beings from hell. Now you roast!

01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:26.370
Fire!

01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:37.470
Listen to me.
You are trapped with a child.

01:01:38.010 --> 01:01:40.730
In case you escape,
you should know:

01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:45.840
We recognize you. The Shogun will
never forget about what was.

01:01:45.990 --> 01:01:48.960
We've sworn to deliver
Lord Kiru.

01:01:49.150 --> 01:01:55.190
But we will not attack you, as long as
you make no move against him.

01:01:55.290 --> 01:01:58.790
If you move, you will see some bloodshed

01:01:58.790 --> 01:02:01.030
You'd be wise not
to follow us.

01:02:01.030 --> 01:02:05.030
Even your mystic play is no match
to the Masters of Death.

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:02.280
Daigoro, be brave.

01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:49.070
Daigoro.

01:06:56.420 --> 01:06:57.780
There's no fire.

01:06:59.290 --> 01:07:01.870
We must warm ourselves or die.

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:06.690
How can't I? You saved me.

01:07:08.350 --> 01:07:10.150
You are trembling.

01:07:12.150 --> 01:07:14.680
More afraid of peace
than war?

01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:31.770
We felt bad
leaving her there.

01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:36.510
We knew she would have to
go back to the Shogun ...

01:10:36.510 --> 01:10:38.590
And commit harakiri.

01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:42.090
She was a ninja, and she
had failed.

01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:46.660
We went on, looking for
the Shogun's brother.

01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:40.220
They are here.

01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:43.140
They must be near.

01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:46.650
I sense the rebels,
I feel them somehow.

01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:51.080
Where can they be?
Watching us.

01:11:51.710 --> 01:11:53.170
No attack.

01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:55.950
Be very careful.

01:16:21.490 --> 01:16:22.710
So ...

01:16:23.190 --> 01:16:25.040
We have our reunion.

01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:32.050
Now we will show you
"Masters of Death."

01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:35.320
Come on.

01:17:36.030 --> 01:17:40.700
How could you throw your sword?

01:18:17.610 --> 01:18:24.180
Your technique ... is ...

01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:28.370
magnificent!

01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:32.700
When cut across the neck...

01:18:32.900 --> 01:18:38.540
a sound like wailing winter wind is heard...

01:18:40.690 --> 01:18:45.360
I always hope to cut someone
like that someday...

01:18:45.850 --> 01:18:48.480
to hear that sound ...

01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:56.270
But have it happen to my own neck
is ridiculous!...

01:19:43.790 --> 01:19:46.710
You can't touch me!
I am the Shogun's brother.

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:47.880
Out!

01:19:52.350 --> 01:19:56.930
The Shogun is nothing to me.

01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:59.510
Die!

01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:42.890
I guess I wish it was different.

01:20:43.870 --> 01:20:46.590
But a wish is only a wish!
