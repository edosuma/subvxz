00:22.022 --> 00:24.440
NARRATOR: Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.

00:32.324 --> 00:33.491
Frak me.

00:33.575 --> 00:35.660
Are you alive?

00:36.912 --> 00:38.913
BOOMER: It's probably
a Cylon itself.

00:38.997 --> 00:40.665
More of an animal, maybe,

00:40.749 --> 00:42.625
than the human models.

00:43.419 --> 00:46.337
Maybe they genetically
design it to perform a task.

00:47.756 --> 00:49.173
To be a fighter.

00:49.633 --> 00:51.467
Why defend...
For no frakking reason!

00:51.552 --> 00:53.302
Knock it off! Knock it off!

00:53.387 --> 00:54.971
Get the hell
out of here now.

00:57.057 --> 00:59.142
I am so sick of her.

01:00.644 --> 01:02.812
What am I doing?
What am I doing?

01:02.896 --> 01:03.938
No!

01:04.022 --> 01:06.399
What the hell happened? Kat's
made the trap a hundred times!

01:06.483 --> 01:08.067
Let me go!
Give me those.

01:08.152 --> 01:09.694
STARBUCK: What is this?
Oh, my God!

01:09.778 --> 01:11.195
Stims.

01:11.280 --> 01:14.115
And by the look of her she's
been taking them by the handful.

01:15.325 --> 01:16.909
I was burnt out.

01:17.870 --> 01:20.830
I started taking stims.
I was so stupid.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.583
As soon as I get back to
Galactica I'll send a rescue party.

01:23.667 --> 01:24.917
Yeah, right.

01:25.002 --> 01:28.337
If I say I'm gonna
do something, I do it.

01:28.422 --> 01:29.422
Count on it.

01:29.757 --> 01:31.382
My kind of woman.

01:33.761 --> 01:35.470
The Resistance Base Camp
is here.

01:35.554 --> 01:36.763
Three hundred clicks north

01:36.847 --> 01:38.598
of the only Cylon air base
in the area.

01:38.682 --> 01:41.851
I respect what you're
trying to do here, however...

01:41.935 --> 01:44.103
We have a duty
to the people we left behind.

01:44.188 --> 01:45.438
We understand that.

01:45.522 --> 01:48.232
We have to find a way to jump
back to Caprica and go get those...

01:48.317 --> 01:49.400
Kara!

02:02.206 --> 02:04.290
STARBUCK: (OVER RADIO)
Entering Sector 2-5-9.

02:04.374 --> 02:07.794
Keep your eyes open, Kat. This
is where BB and Jo-Jo bought it.

02:09.046 --> 02:12.507
Come on out, Scar, you ugly
Cylon son of a bitch. Let's party.

02:12.591 --> 02:15.259
I don't think
he's going to RSVP, Kat.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.470
He prefers surprise parties.

02:17.554 --> 02:20.014
KAT: Yeah? Well, he'll be
surprised when I blow his ass apart.

02:20.098 --> 02:21.933
Yeah, that'll be the day.

02:24.269 --> 02:27.480
Kassie. Kassie?
Wasn't that her name?

02:27.564 --> 02:28.773
STARBUCK: Whose name?

02:30.609 --> 02:31.818
Reilly's girlfriend.

02:31.902 --> 02:33.903
You know, Kat, I told you
I have no frakking idea.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.530
So give it a rest,
all right?

02:38.283 --> 02:40.535
STARBUCK: Reilly's dead
for one very simple reason.

02:40.619 --> 02:42.411
He couldn't control his fear.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.999
KAT: Yeah, poor idiot
cut and ran.

02:47.084 --> 02:49.877
Gave the toaster
a free shot up his ass.

02:50.379 --> 02:52.046
Scar spooked him.

02:52.506 --> 02:53.923
He saw
that motherfrakker's red eye

02:54.007 --> 02:56.467
coming straight for him
and he panicked.

02:56.927 --> 02:58.177
Reilly was a good stick.

02:58.262 --> 03:00.513
A little short on guts,
but a good stick.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.223
Beano had plenty.

03:03.517 --> 03:06.060
Took Cally an hour
to clean out his cockpit.

03:06.854 --> 03:09.939
Hey, does anybody remember the
name of Reilly's girlfriend?

03:10.858 --> 03:11.858
No.

03:12.276 --> 03:15.403
Karen, I think.
Died on Picon. Karen?

03:15.487 --> 03:18.155
No. Was it Kathy? Kathy?

03:18.657 --> 03:20.032
You guys,
what does it matter?

03:20.117 --> 03:21.742
Gonna hold
a little prayer circle,

03:21.827 --> 03:23.703
good cry, the whole thing?

03:23.787 --> 03:25.913
Actually, it does matter.

03:29.251 --> 03:30.209
Hi.

03:30.294 --> 03:32.336
Hey!
This is Ensign Baxton.

03:32.462 --> 03:33.921
Ensign Clark.

03:34.840 --> 03:37.425
And I guess
we're your new bunkmates.

03:38.302 --> 03:39.510
Welcome.

03:39.803 --> 03:42.638
We just finished
Viper training on Pegasus.

03:43.265 --> 03:45.266
Ready to kick
some Cylon butt.

03:45.392 --> 03:46.517
So was Beano.

03:46.602 --> 03:48.477
Who's Beano?

03:49.313 --> 03:50.479
Here.

03:55.652 --> 03:59.822
Oh, Scar is gonna smoke you
like a fine cigar, my man.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.115
Who's Scar?

04:01.199 --> 04:02.658
DUCK: Not who, what.

04:02.743 --> 04:06.370
The toasters' top gun. Deadliest
Raider in the Cylon fleet.

04:07.372 --> 04:10.124
Give me a break. What, they're
machines. One's the same as the next.

04:10.208 --> 04:13.586
Yeah, that's what we thought, till
Captain Thrace cut the brain out of one.

04:14.338 --> 04:15.922
HOTDOG: Scar's the best
they got.

04:16.006 --> 04:18.925
Lot of pilots died
going after that bastard.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.886
Why do they call him Scar?

04:21.970 --> 04:24.639
Oh, you'll find out
soon enough.

04:24.848 --> 04:27.308
He's got a taste for nuggets.
Easy pickings.

04:30.812 --> 04:31.938
KAT: Whoa!
Hold up, Starbuck.

04:32.022 --> 04:35.191
I think I got something. The Big
Spud. Lower rim. You see that?

04:37.194 --> 04:38.569
STARBUCK: Negative.

04:40.322 --> 04:42.865
There was a time you would
have noticed that before me.

04:43.909 --> 04:45.451
Fine, you're the shooter.

04:45.827 --> 04:47.078
KAT: You gotta keep up.

04:47.162 --> 04:49.288
STARBUCK: Kat,
please, don't screw up.

04:55.837 --> 05:00.049
So, how does Scar take out an
experienced pilot like Beano?

05:00.801 --> 05:01.884
He hides...
STARBUCK: He hides

05:01.969 --> 05:06.055
behind an asteroid, or the
debris field that you've ignored

05:06.848 --> 05:10.017
because it looked like
a bunch of harmless rocks.

05:10.852 --> 05:15.398
You see, Scar doesn't like to
fight till the odds are on his side.

05:16.566 --> 05:20.403
And then, suddenly,
out of nowhere, bam.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.657
He pops out,
blows you to pieces.

05:24.783 --> 05:27.868
And then jumps away
before you can return fire.

05:28.203 --> 05:30.121
Well, if you ask me,
I think Scar's a coward.

05:30.205 --> 05:31.372
(LAUGHING)

05:31.456 --> 05:34.583
This isn't dueling pistols
at dawn, this is war.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.086
You never wanna fight fair.

05:37.254 --> 05:40.047
You wanna sneak up
behind your enemy

05:40.132 --> 05:42.258
and club him
over the head.

05:43.427 --> 05:46.679
You see,
Scar understands that.

05:47.973 --> 05:49.390
And so do I.

05:50.934 --> 05:53.102
So that's why
I'm gonna kill him.

05:53.562 --> 05:54.687
You?

05:56.440 --> 05:58.441
Starbuck,
you can barely walk.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.528
Look who's talking.
Stim junkie.

06:02.612 --> 06:03.946
ALL: Whoa.

06:06.450 --> 06:10.327
You know, I wouldn't be calling anybody
a junkie if I were you, Starbuck.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.914
Not with the way you've been
pounding back that booze lately.

06:14.458 --> 06:16.417
One Tigh on this ship's
enough.

06:21.590 --> 06:23.632
Well, I got...

06:25.343 --> 06:29.055
I got 200 here, says I nail
Scar's chrome-plated ass.

06:29.139 --> 06:30.431
And when I do,

06:30.515 --> 06:33.601
you hand that top gun over to
me and pour me my first drink.

06:33.685 --> 06:35.227
PILOT 1: All right, Kat!

06:35.312 --> 06:37.730
Your lips will never
touch the rim, little girl.

06:37.814 --> 06:39.190
(PILOTS CHANTING)

it's got to be Scar.

you little frakker.

Starbuck,
kiss your 200 goodbye!

This guy's mine!

09:29.236 --> 09:30.986
STARBUCK: Something's
definitely wrong.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.655
That can't be Scar.

09:33.448 --> 09:36.033
He should be jumping
or wheeling a gun at us.

09:43.041 --> 09:44.500
I'll check our tails.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.013
Frak!

I'm hit, I'm hit, I'm hit!

10:07.649 --> 10:09.984
KAT: See, Beano opened fire
too early.

10:10.151 --> 10:11.277
You guys,

10:11.403 --> 10:13.445
you've gotta fill the
windscreen with the sucker

10:13.530 --> 10:15.072
or you're not going
to hit him.

10:17.033 --> 10:19.201
See, look.
He's still not close enough.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.662
Beano's already dead.
He just doesn't know it yet.

10:22.872 --> 10:25.165
Do any of you guys see
where he went wrong?

10:29.129 --> 10:31.005
There, you see that glint?

10:33.925 --> 10:35.134
There.

10:35.260 --> 10:36.510
That's a Raider.

10:36.594 --> 10:39.513
If Beano hadn't fixated on his
target, he'd have seen that.

10:39.597 --> 10:41.056
BB: Was it Scar?

10:51.735 --> 10:53.277
There he is,
boys and girls.

10:54.779 --> 10:57.531
There's the motherfrakker
I'm gonna kill.

11:01.244 --> 11:04.913
I'm afraid this is one of those
"good news, bad news" conversations.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.540
Bad news first.

11:07.292 --> 11:09.918
The mining ship's broken
another drill bit.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.670
We need to extend again.

11:11.755 --> 11:12.880
Another eight days.

11:12.964 --> 11:15.632
Eight more days.
Son of a bitch.

11:18.720 --> 11:21.722
They've just discovered an
incredibly rich vein of ore.

11:22.265 --> 11:24.975
Enough to build two entire
squadrons of Vipers.

11:25.060 --> 11:26.727
I can't walk away from that.

11:26.811 --> 11:28.270
What's the good news?

11:28.521 --> 11:32.524
The Pegasus production team has just
turned out its first combat-ready Viper.

11:32.859 --> 11:35.110
We are beginning
to replace our losses.

11:35.653 --> 11:38.238
Are they gonna be able
to replace pilots as well?

11:38.823 --> 11:41.033
STARBUCK: Let's review
the tactical situation.

11:41.117 --> 11:44.036
Four weeks ago, our
mining ship struck pay dirt

11:44.120 --> 11:45.537
on this asteroid.

11:45.622 --> 11:47.081
A pile of strategic metals

11:47.165 --> 11:49.041
that we need
to build new ships.

11:49.125 --> 11:51.960
Since we're sitting ducks
until the miners finish the job,

11:52.045 --> 11:54.380
the old man has sent the Fleet
out of harm's way

11:54.464 --> 11:56.340
under the protection
of Pegasus.

11:56.424 --> 11:59.468
Our job is to stay behind
and protect the miners.

11:59.552 --> 12:03.389
Unfortunately, this star system
is full of rocks and dust.

12:03.473 --> 12:06.058
Dradis cannot tell the rocks
from the bad guys,

12:06.142 --> 12:08.560
so our only reliable system
of detection is...

12:08.645 --> 12:10.104
Our eyeballs.

12:16.569 --> 12:20.656
Which means we have to put
those eyeballs way out there.

12:21.157 --> 12:23.992
Split up,
cover a huge perimeter.

12:24.160 --> 12:27.413
We'll be patrolling the area
in divisions of four

12:27.497 --> 12:28.914
at these picket points.

12:28.998 --> 12:31.625
Twos. We're going
in sections of twos.

12:31.709 --> 12:33.836
Are you planning the ops
for me now, too?

12:34.170 --> 12:35.421
(SIGHS)

12:35.505 --> 12:37.172

12:37.841 --> 12:41.260

to control a larger area.

in the briefings.

12:53.356 --> 12:55.023
(STARBUCK CLEARS THROAT)

12:55.525 --> 12:58.485
You're right.
So we do go in twos.

13:00.155 --> 13:02.281
PILOT: (WHISPERING) Great.
You ask her to spread out...

13:02.365 --> 13:06.535
Scar and his buddies are out
there, looking for easy kills.

13:07.078 --> 13:08.620
Let's not give them any.

13:08.705 --> 13:11.081
This operation is vital

13:11.749 --> 13:14.793
to the long-term survival
of this Fleet.

13:14.878 --> 13:16.044
ADAMA: Yes, it is.

13:17.046 --> 13:19.381
And we'll continue
to support it.

13:19.883 --> 13:22.301
They're grinding us down
Viper by Viper.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.970
Why have they stopped
coming at us en masse?

13:25.054 --> 13:27.598
Is it because we destroyed
their Resurrection ship?

13:27.682 --> 13:29.475
Starbuck's working on that.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.518
BOOMER: You know,
Scar has probably died

13:31.603 --> 13:33.645
and been reborn
a dozen times.

13:35.356 --> 13:37.191
You may have
faced him before.

13:37.901 --> 13:40.944
So what, Raiders
reincarnate, just like you?

13:41.321 --> 13:43.238
Yeah. Just like me.

13:45.575 --> 13:46.742
Great.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.369
What a frakking world.

13:50.914 --> 13:53.290
A Raider's much like
a trained animal,

13:53.374 --> 13:56.627
with basic consciousness
and survival instinct.

13:58.421 --> 14:01.840
You know, but with the destruction
of the Resurrection ship,

14:01.925 --> 14:04.510
when they die,
they're really dead.

14:05.386 --> 14:07.888
So, they're not gonna
mount mass attacks

14:07.972 --> 14:09.765
where they could have
major casualties.

14:11.434 --> 14:13.268
Raiders reincarnate.

Makes sense, doesn't it?

14:16.606 --> 14:18.565
It takes months for you
to train a nugget

14:18.650 --> 14:20.442
into an effective Viper pilot.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.570
And then they get killed and
then you lose your experience,

14:23.655 --> 14:25.364
their knowledge,
their skill sets,

14:25.448 --> 14:26.823
it's gone forever.

14:26.908 --> 14:29.535
So, if you could bring them back
and put them in a brand new body,

14:29.619 --> 14:31.203
wouldn't you do it?

14:31.287 --> 14:33.956
'Cause death then becomes
a learning experience.

14:37.335 --> 14:41.129
How... How many pilots
have we lost?

14:42.799 --> 14:44.633
I mean, have you lost?

14:50.765 --> 14:54.476
You know, there are times
when I look at you

14:57.063 --> 14:59.648
and I forget
what you are.

15:03.152 --> 15:04.736
All I see is

15:06.030 --> 15:07.614
that kid

15:08.950 --> 15:11.743
that spooched her landings
day after day.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.330
The kid that was
frakking the Chief

15:15.415 --> 15:17.916
and thinking she was
getting away with it.

15:22.630 --> 15:24.339
Yeah, I remember.

15:28.219 --> 15:30.345
You were
like a big sister.

15:44.986 --> 15:46.194
Kara,

15:47.155 --> 15:49.197
be careful of Scar, okay?

15:49.949 --> 15:51.074
He's filled with rage.

15:51.159 --> 15:52.534
About what?

15:53.244 --> 15:55.579
Dying's a painful
and traumatic experience.

15:56.331 --> 15:59.416
Every time he's reborn, he's
filled with more bitter memories.

16:00.877 --> 16:03.712
Scar hates you every bit
as much as you hate him.

16:13.556 --> 16:16.725
STARBUCK: A Raider is
a squirmy son of a bitch.

16:17.435 --> 16:20.646
You won't be able to keep him in
your sights for more than two seconds,

16:20.730 --> 16:23.815
so you have to deliver a
killing burst within that time,

16:23.900 --> 16:26.151
or he will turn
and nail you.

16:26.402 --> 16:28.236
All that yanking and banking

16:28.321 --> 16:30.989
gives you one hell
of a case of vertigo.

16:31.074 --> 16:33.116
And that is what
this chair simulates.

16:33.618 --> 16:35.369
KAT: All right, Jo-Jo!

16:35.453 --> 16:36.870
DUCK: Come on.
KAT: Come on, Jo-Jo.

16:36.954 --> 16:38.163
BB: Come on, Jo-Jo.
Let's go.

16:38.247 --> 16:39.665
DUCK: He's not looking
too great.

16:39.749 --> 16:40.791
Hang in there.
Come on.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.876
KAT: Hit him, hit him. Tough stuff. Go!

16:43.753 --> 16:45.212
(ALL SHOUTING)

16:45.296 --> 16:47.089
Hey, hey, hey.
BB: Jo-Jo, up, up, up!

16:48.675 --> 16:49.758
Time!

16:49.842 --> 16:51.259
(BUZZER SOUNDING)

16:53.805 --> 16:56.098
Not bad.
At least he hit the target.

16:56.557 --> 16:58.558
Well, that's a lot better
than I did the first time.

16:58.643 --> 17:00.686
I think I took out
that clock over there.

17:00.770 --> 17:02.437
So, what's the
all-time record?

17:02.522 --> 17:04.439
HOTDOG: Four hits
on the X-ring.

17:05.024 --> 17:07.234
Are you kidding?
Who did that?

17:08.653 --> 17:09.820
I did.

17:09.946 --> 17:12.864
Mind if I give it a shot,
for old times' sake?

17:12.949 --> 17:14.282
Be my guest.

17:15.785 --> 17:17.077
DUCK: Yeah.
KARA: Yeah.

17:17.161 --> 17:18.870
Come on, now, Kat.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.292
Two seconds.
DUCK: Go, Kat. Come on, Kat!

17:24.377 --> 17:26.878
WOMAN: Go, Kat. Get him!
STARBUCK: Time!

17:26.963 --> 17:28.463
(BUZZER SOUNDING)

17:32.719 --> 17:33.927
Five.
Yes!

17:34.011 --> 17:36.680
ALL: Whoa! All right!
Way to go!

17:36.806 --> 17:38.932
(BULLETS ZIPPING)
Frak! I'm hit! I'm hit!

17:39.016 --> 17:40.016
KAT: Starbuck!

17:40.101 --> 17:42.561
I'm hit, I'm hit,
I'm hit! Kat.

17:42.687 --> 17:45.105
Starbuck,
where the hell are you?

17:45.189 --> 17:46.982
Starbuck,
I lost visual on you.

17:51.863 --> 17:53.989
Starbuck,
what's your position?

17:57.410 --> 17:59.411
STARBUCK: Primary and
secondary hydraulics are bent.

17:59.495 --> 18:00.620
I can deal with it!

18:00.705 --> 18:03.373
Starbuck, I got no visual
on you! Where you at?

18:04.834 --> 18:06.918
Forget it, Kat.
Scar is mine.

18:09.422 --> 18:12.674
KAT: Don't be an idiot,
Starbuck! What's your position?

18:15.136 --> 18:17.345
STARBUCK: Yeah,
you remember me, don't you?

18:19.390 --> 18:23.226
You want my ass so bad you can
taste it. Well, keep coming!

18:23.311 --> 18:27.689
'Cause I guaran-frakking-tee you I
will put you down this time, for good!

18:38.075 --> 18:39.409
(GRUNTING)

18:39.744 --> 18:40.994
One more.

18:42.205 --> 18:44.873
HELO: Come on, Starbuck,
let's go. Get it up.

18:46.083 --> 18:47.417
(GRUNTING)

18:50.046 --> 18:52.214
Why are you pushing so hard?

18:53.841 --> 18:57.219
Kat's just another hotshot
kid out to make her bones.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.556
Like you were
before you met Anders.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.897
You ever think about him?

19:08.981 --> 19:10.398
What's the point?

19:10.483 --> 19:11.817
He's dead.

19:16.072 --> 19:17.072
Kara,

19:18.491 --> 19:20.659
if you didn't think he had
a chance of surviving,

19:20.743 --> 19:23.078
why'd you promise to return
with a rescue party?

19:23.913 --> 19:26.164
(PANTING) I thought I was...

19:29.085 --> 19:31.211
I don't know what I thought.

19:51.774 --> 19:54.901
Captain Thrace,
if Scar jumps us out there...

19:54.986 --> 19:57.279
Keep your eyes open
so he can't.

19:59.490 --> 20:01.575
But if I screw up
and he bushwhacks me,

20:01.659 --> 20:03.326
what do I do then?

20:05.288 --> 20:06.538
Come on.

20:06.706 --> 20:10.500
They drilled this into you over and
over and over again at basic air combat.

20:10.626 --> 20:12.252
I know, sir, but Scar
is something I'm not...

20:12.336 --> 20:15.046
Scar is no different
than any other attacker.

20:15.131 --> 20:17.632
If he comes at you,
turn into him.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.634
Get closer, pull the trigger.

20:19.719 --> 20:23.054
Into him. Get closer. Pull
the trigger. Thank you, sir.

20:23.139 --> 20:25.098
Don't run, or you'll die.

20:26.726 --> 20:27.851
Right.

20:32.148 --> 20:33.982
What are you waiting for?

20:34.191 --> 20:36.610
(SIGHS)
Nothing, sir.

20:38.988 --> 20:40.322
Come here.

20:40.823 --> 20:43.033
Come here,
I wanna talk to you.

20:44.327 --> 20:45.493
KAT: Now listen to me.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.829
You're flying Duck's
wing today, Baxton, right?

20:47.914 --> 20:49.956
Yes. Call sign BB,
sir.

20:50.041 --> 20:52.667
Okay, Duck's one of our
best pilots that we got.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.586
Okay, so just do what he
says, and you'll be fine.

20:54.670 --> 20:57.005
Just don't let the Raiders
get anywhere near the miners.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.423
Okay.
Yeah.

20:58.507 --> 20:59.633
Thank you, sir.

20:59.717 --> 21:01.259
Go get them, Tiger.

21:03.679 --> 21:04.930
Starbuck.

21:08.434 --> 21:10.644
That kid needs more
than a pat on the ass

21:10.728 --> 21:13.271
and a textbook quote
about tactics, okay?

21:13.356 --> 21:16.483
You wanna be the wet-nurse, go
right ahead, all right. Be my guest.

21:16.567 --> 21:19.277
His jacket says he's
a qualified Viper jock,

21:19.362 --> 21:23.073
so I either fly him or I ground
him and then we go up short.

21:24.408 --> 21:26.034
What's it gonna be?

21:26.786 --> 21:28.328
Your call, Kat.

21:31.499 --> 21:34.668
STARBUCK: Galactica, Starbuck.
Wilco return to base.

21:34.752 --> 21:36.002
DUALLA:
Roger that, Starbuck.

21:36.087 --> 21:37.253
DUCK: BB, Duck.

21:37.338 --> 21:40.298
Four Raiders from behind the
rock at left ten, coming hard.

21:40.383 --> 21:41.383
Looks like Scar.

21:41.467 --> 21:43.301
BB: Duck, BB,
what do we do?

21:43.386 --> 21:46.805
We don't have enough fuel
to mix it up. We bug out, BB.

21:46.889 --> 21:49.140
Let our relief deal with
them. We're going home.

21:49.225 --> 21:53.061
BB: Negative. Starbuck said to
turn into any attack. Weapons hot.

21:53.145 --> 21:55.313
You're bingo fuel.
Don't attack, you idiot.

21:55.398 --> 21:58.191
DUCK: Gods damn it, BB, this
is the frakking exception.

21:58.275 --> 21:59.943
Abort and reform!

22:00.194 --> 22:02.070
STARBUCK: Duck, Starbuck.
Position?

22:02.154 --> 22:04.030
Four-two alpha,
behind the Big Spud.

22:04.115 --> 22:06.741
We need a hand,
right frakking now.

22:07.702 --> 22:10.328
You're on your own, Duck.
Everybody's way out of range.

22:10.413 --> 22:12.914
STARBUCK: Duck,
be there in six minutes.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.833
KAT: Duck, Kat.
Eight minutes, out.

22:14.917 --> 22:17.585
BB: Duck, they're on
my six! Oh, my Gods.

22:17.670 --> 22:19.004
(YELLING) Duck!

22:38.315 --> 22:39.399
It's all right, Jo-Jo.

22:39.483 --> 22:41.026
MAN: Verify PC-2
pressure zero,

22:41.110 --> 22:44.279
throttles closed, oxygen
generator and master switches off.

22:48.659 --> 22:50.368
Check.
Shutdown complete.

22:50.453 --> 22:51.745
Nothing you could do,
Captain.

22:51.829 --> 22:53.288
Too far away.

22:56.792 --> 22:58.793
KAT: Nice work, Starbuck.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.920
What the hell happened to BB?

23:01.005 --> 23:02.464
What happened?

23:02.715 --> 23:05.800
He did exactly what you
told him to do, Captain.

23:07.136 --> 23:09.512
Him and Duck had bingo fuel
and a head start home,

23:09.597 --> 23:12.390
but instead, that FNG
turned and attacked.

23:12.975 --> 23:15.268
Scar lit him up
like a pinwheel.

23:15.895 --> 23:18.271
Why'd he try to
take on Scar by himself?

23:18.439 --> 23:20.023
Stupid idiot.

23:20.107 --> 23:22.067
"Try to run
and you're dead. "

23:22.151 --> 23:25.320
I heard you. You drilled that
into that poor moron's head.

23:26.697 --> 23:27.864
You know what?

23:27.948 --> 23:30.784
You and I both know that
99% of the time

23:30.868 --> 23:33.078
that is the right move.

23:33.996 --> 23:35.497
Not this time.

23:46.675 --> 23:48.510
APOLLO: You know
what gets me?

23:50.179 --> 23:54.099
I know that in two weeks
I won't remember his face.

23:55.851 --> 23:59.270
I can't remember any of their
faces after they're killed.

24:00.189 --> 24:02.899
No matter how hard I
try, they just fade.

24:04.693 --> 24:07.112
I don't even remember
their names.

24:09.198 --> 24:10.573
The names.

24:11.283 --> 24:14.577
Well, let's see,
there was Flattop,

24:19.375 --> 24:22.043
who bought it on
his thousandth landing.

24:22.753 --> 24:24.504
There was Chuckles.

24:25.297 --> 24:27.132
(LAUGHING)
Stop it, all right?

24:27.675 --> 24:29.384
Please,
it's not funny.

24:29.468 --> 24:30.468
All right.

24:30.553 --> 24:32.512
It's not funny.
It is funny.

24:32.888 --> 24:37.183
You know, the President says
that we're saving humanity

24:38.227 --> 24:41.396
for a bright, shiny future

24:43.065 --> 24:44.315
on Earth

24:45.651 --> 24:48.236
that you and I are
never gonna see.

24:50.531 --> 24:53.700
We're not.
Because we go out

24:54.827 --> 24:59.038
over and over again,

25:00.499 --> 25:04.586
until some day,
some metal motherfrakker

25:07.548 --> 25:11.050
is gonna catch us on a bad day
and just blow us away.

25:14.388 --> 25:17.307
Bright, shiny futures
are overrated, anyway.

25:28.110 --> 25:29.485
That's why

25:30.529 --> 25:33.990
we got to get what we can
right now.

25:36.493 --> 25:38.119
I'll drink to that.

25:40.581 --> 25:42.040
To right now.

25:48.130 --> 25:49.756
So why don't we?

25:52.593 --> 25:54.260
Why don't we what?

26:08.234 --> 26:09.692
Hey, wait a minute.
What?

26:09.777 --> 26:10.985
Wait a minute.

26:14.823 --> 26:16.532
Ow! Hey, slow down.

26:27.211 --> 26:29.128
Whoa. This isn't a race.

26:29.213 --> 26:31.756
Kara, what's going on?
What's going on?

26:32.132 --> 26:34.550
What's wrong with you?
All right?

26:36.262 --> 26:39.973
Okay, you know what? I don't
wanna know. I don't wanna know.

26:40.057 --> 26:41.849
Hey! What about us?

26:42.059 --> 26:43.977
There is no "us".
All right?

26:44.061 --> 26:45.603
I just wanted a good lay.

26:45.688 --> 26:48.439
There is nothing here.
Do you get that?

26:48.732 --> 26:50.233
Nothing!
Sure.

26:52.111 --> 26:53.444
My Gods!

26:58.826 --> 26:59.867
Hey.

27:02.371 --> 27:03.830
Well, that's just great.

27:03.914 --> 27:05.623
Frak or fight, huh?

27:05.708 --> 27:08.668
Okay, maybe I am
just a quick lay,

27:08.752 --> 27:10.461
but, Kara,
I'm also your friend.

27:10.546 --> 27:13.131
I am hung up
on a dead guy, okay?

27:14.133 --> 27:16.301
And it is pissing me off.

27:17.386 --> 27:19.721
And I don't know
what I'm doing.

27:24.059 --> 27:26.644
Anders, right? On Caprica.
The resistance fighter.

27:27.062 --> 27:28.771
Yeah, well, Samuel's dead,
so what does it matter?

27:28.897 --> 27:31.566
Oh, Kara, please, for once in your
life... I don't need your pity, Lee.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.151
You haven't got my pity!

27:33.235 --> 27:36.029
Listen, you are fine. You
are fine with the dead guys.

27:36.113 --> 27:38.406
It's the living ones
you can't deal with.

27:40.326 --> 27:41.534
(SIGHS)

28:59.196 --> 29:00.738
There you are. I got
visual on you, Starbuck.

29:00.823 --> 29:02.657
I'm inbound
about 15 out.

29:05.994 --> 29:07.078
Now!

29:09.748 --> 29:12.291
STARBUCK: All right, Scar, let's
see how much you like playing chicken

29:12.376 --> 29:14.252
when you can't downward,
you bitch.

29:14.378 --> 29:16.045
(GUN FIRING)
How's it feel, you bastard?

29:16.130 --> 29:19.674
One of us is gonna have to break
away first and it isn't gonna be me.

29:24.430 --> 29:28.015
KAT: Starbuck, wake up! He's a
machine! He's not gonna break!

29:30.144 --> 29:32.437
You're committing suicide,
Starbuck!

29:51.707 --> 29:53.458
In two-on-two engagements,

29:53.542 --> 29:56.794
Cylon Raiders like to isolate
individual Vipers,

29:57.588 --> 29:59.589
and then gang up on one,

30:00.799 --> 30:04.802
hoping to kill it before his
wingman has a chance to protect him.

30:08.056 --> 30:09.265
MAN: Captain.

30:18.567 --> 30:21.444
Which is exactly what happened
to Jo-Jo 20 minutes ago.

30:21.528 --> 30:23.070
KAT: Oh, no.
DUCK: Frak me.

30:23.572 --> 30:24.947
Was it Scar?

30:25.616 --> 30:29.160
The bastard smoked Jo-Jo and
jumped away in less than 15 seconds

30:29.244 --> 30:31.579
before his wingman
could get a shot off.

30:33.123 --> 30:34.916
And where were you?

30:37.836 --> 30:38.920
What?

30:39.755 --> 30:43.758
Flight schedule had you flying
lead for Jo-Jo on that patrol, so,

30:44.343 --> 30:47.178
why'd you assign Snake
to take your place?

30:47.596 --> 30:50.765
Was it too early in the
morning for you, Starbuck?

30:51.767 --> 30:54.769
What exactly are you
trying to say, Lieutenant?

30:55.354 --> 30:57.939
What I'm trying to say,
Captain,

30:58.023 --> 31:00.441
is maybe if you weren't up
all night drinking,

31:00.526 --> 31:02.610
Jo-Jo would have
still been here.

31:02.694 --> 31:04.487
PILOT: (WHISPERING)
Shut up.

31:05.781 --> 31:07.198
(CLEARS THROAT)

31:12.120 --> 31:13.788
Give us the room.

31:15.082 --> 31:16.707
(ALL MURMURING)

31:32.474 --> 31:34.475
What is it
with you, Katraine?

31:34.560 --> 31:39.146
Ever since I got back, you have
been on my ass like a bad rash.

31:39.565 --> 31:42.233
You know, coming in late for a
briefing 'cause you're hung over,

31:42.317 --> 31:43.317
that's bad enough,

31:43.402 --> 31:45.903
but when you back out
on a mission...

31:46.280 --> 31:50.866
I put Snake in my place because I was
in no condition to fly and I knew that.

31:52.119 --> 31:54.579
You see, unlike you,
I don't take a bunch of pills

31:54.663 --> 31:56.581
and then climb
in my cockpit so wired

31:56.665 --> 31:59.000
that I can't land
the frakking ship.

32:01.753 --> 32:04.297
Starbuck,
you're an embarrassment.

32:05.424 --> 32:07.800
You used to be the
hottest stick on the Fleet.

32:07.884 --> 32:08.968
Now,

32:10.178 --> 32:13.514
you're just a reckless drunk who
sends other people out to get killed.

32:20.230 --> 32:22.940
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?

32:23.025 --> 32:25.359
Are you going to hit me,
Starbuck?

32:30.115 --> 32:31.741
It scares you, doesn't it?

32:31.825 --> 32:33.451
Actually, no.

32:36.580 --> 32:39.123
You're afraid
most of the time, Kat.

32:40.208 --> 32:41.792
You're afraid that
you're going to end up

32:41.877 --> 32:44.253
like that picture
of Reilly's girlfriend.

32:45.881 --> 32:47.381
Some little

32:49.051 --> 32:53.220
forgotten picture
that nobody really remembers.

32:55.891 --> 32:59.060
You see, that's why
you're riding my ass so hard.

33:00.562 --> 33:02.772
So no one will notice
that Scar

33:03.690 --> 33:06.192
scares the living crap
out of you.

33:09.321 --> 33:10.571
(GRUNTS)

33:16.286 --> 33:17.703
Ten-hut!

33:24.086 --> 33:25.711
What's going on?

33:29.007 --> 33:31.342
A little tactical
discussion, sir.

33:33.095 --> 33:35.096
Well, it must have
been lively.

33:38.767 --> 33:39.934
All right,
I'm pairing you two up.

33:40.018 --> 33:42.728
Kat, I want you to fly Starbuck's
wing out by the Big Spud.

33:42.813 --> 33:44.230
Sir, I...

33:46.942 --> 33:50.027
I got a hunch a couple Raiders are
gonna try and sneak through that sector,

33:50.112 --> 33:53.781
so I want my heavy hitters
out there to greet them.

33:55.617 --> 33:57.493
Skids up in 49 minutes.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.084
Sir.

34:13.802 --> 34:15.052
Starbuck.

34:20.809 --> 34:22.309
Are you okay?

35:31.379 --> 35:33.297
STARBUCK: (OVER RADIO)
Entering Sector 2-5-9.

35:33.381 --> 35:36.884
Keep your eyes open, Kat. This
is where BB and Jo-Jo bought it.

35:37.385 --> 35:39.470
Kassie. Kassie?
Maybe that was her name?

35:39.888 --> 35:41.889
You know, Kat, I told you
I have no frakking idea.

35:41.973 --> 35:43.140
So give it a rest,
all right?

35:43.225 --> 35:45.184
KAT: Whoa, hold up, Starbuck.
You see that?

35:45.393 --> 35:47.394
Oh, yeah, it's got to be Scar.

36:01.034 --> 36:02.993
STARBUCK: Something's
definitely wrong.

36:03.078 --> 36:04.829
That can't be Scar.

36:07.791 --> 36:08.833
Frak! I'm hit!

36:08.917 --> 36:10.084
KAT: Starbuck!

36:10.168 --> 36:12.002
STARBUCK:
I'm hit, I'm hit, I'm hit!

36:15.423 --> 36:17.883
Don't be an idiot, Starbuck!
What's your position?

36:20.178 --> 36:22.304
STARBUCK: Yeah,
you remember me, don't you?

36:23.849 --> 36:25.432
There you are.
I got visual on you, Starbuck.

36:25.517 --> 36:27.017
I'm inbound
about 15 out.

36:27.102 --> 36:29.687
STARBUCK: All right, Scar, let's
see how much you like playing chicken

36:29.771 --> 36:31.522
when you can't downward,
you bitch.

36:32.148 --> 36:33.566
How's it feel, you bastard?

36:33.650 --> 36:36.735
One of us is gonna have to break away
first and it isn't going to be me.

36:36.820 --> 36:39.905
Starbuck, I'm inbound
your starboard...

36:42.284 --> 36:43.951
Starbuck, wake up!

36:45.036 --> 36:47.329
KAT: He's a machine!
He's not gonna break!

36:53.879 --> 36:56.422
He's a machine!
He's not gonna break!

36:57.215 --> 36:59.300
I do this and you lose.

37:01.219 --> 37:03.554
You're committing suicide,
Starbuck!

37:12.314 --> 37:13.898
I'm coming back.

37:20.655 --> 37:23.532
I said it. I meant it.

37:26.161 --> 37:27.286
Yeah, okay.

37:59.069 --> 38:00.611
Gods damn it!

38:07.869 --> 38:09.828
I am gonna put him
right in front of you.

38:09.913 --> 38:12.706
Do not miss him,
you frakking stim junkie.

38:24.886 --> 38:26.303
(GUN FIRING)

38:35.063 --> 38:36.647
(WHOOPING)

38:38.900 --> 38:41.819
That's the way it's done!
Yeah!

38:41.903 --> 38:44.029
Let's go home, Skipper!

38:44.114 --> 38:45.614
(KAT WHOOPING)

38:51.913 --> 38:53.580
(ALL CHEERING)

38:59.295 --> 39:01.547
KAT: (WHOOPING)
Captain Starbuck!

39:02.590 --> 39:04.091
Hey, Starbuck.

39:05.885 --> 39:07.594
My cup runneth dry.

39:10.515 --> 39:14.393
Seems I recall somebody boasting that
my lips would never touch this rim?

39:55.560 --> 39:57.061
WOMAN: For you, Kat.

40:01.316 --> 40:02.816
You earned it.

40:23.505 --> 40:24.671
To BB,

40:26.674 --> 40:27.841
Jo-Jo,

40:29.302 --> 40:30.511
Reilly,

40:32.180 --> 40:33.347
Beano,

40:35.517 --> 40:36.683
Dipper,

40:37.977 --> 40:39.186
Flattop.

40:41.356 --> 40:42.648
Chuckles.

40:44.692 --> 40:45.859
Jolly.

40:47.195 --> 40:48.529
Crashdown.

40:49.906 --> 40:51.198
Sheppard.

40:52.659 --> 40:53.659
Dash.

40:56.704 --> 40:57.913
Flyboy.

41:00.375 --> 41:01.708
Stepchild.

41:03.795 --> 41:05.045
Puppet.

41:07.715 --> 41:09.049
Fireball.

41:29.863 --> 41:31.405
To all of them.

41:34.826 --> 41:36.326
So say we all.

41:36.744 --> 41:38.954
ALL: So say we all!

41:39.539 --> 41:41.081
So say we all.

41:49.048 --> 41:51.258
I could have done it,
you know?

41:52.385 --> 41:53.927
I could have
taken out Scar.

41:56.389 --> 41:58.932
Head-on pass,
straight for him.

42:01.936 --> 42:04.396
Just needed
to get a little closer.

42:05.356 --> 42:06.982
So why didn't you do it?

42:07.317 --> 42:09.610
I probably would have
died in the process.

42:10.028 --> 42:12.029
The bastard was too good.

42:13.239 --> 42:16.450
A couple months ago, I wouldn't
even have thought about that.

42:16.701 --> 42:18.202
Would have just gone
for the glory,

42:18.286 --> 42:20.746
hoping I could pull it out
of the fire somehow.

42:21.456 --> 42:23.081
Don't be kicking yourself.

42:23.166 --> 42:26.210
You did the right thing and
called in your wingman, okay?

42:26.294 --> 42:28.962
Scar's dead. You and Kat
came back alive.

42:32.217 --> 42:33.759
That's not
why I did it, though.

42:33.843 --> 42:35.969
I can't get Anders
out of my head.

42:36.846 --> 42:40.349
I can't get over this insane
hope that maybe he's alive.

42:47.649 --> 42:49.691
You got something
to live for now,

42:49.776 --> 42:51.401
not just die for.

42:55.657 --> 42:56.990
(LAUGHING)

42:59.244 --> 43:00.661

43:02.872 --> 43:04.665

for the count.

43:04.832 --> 43:06.458
(GROANING)

43:09.128 --> 43:11.129
Time out. Okay.
