WEBVTT

00:01.702 --> 00:04.372
Our new health inspection report
came in. You want to guess
what we got? A "C," George,

00:04.405 --> 00:06.307
thanks to you
 and your culinary debauchery.

00:06.340 --> 00:07.775
I know I apologized
about being a jackass

00:07.808 --> 00:09.377
about your
new boyfriend,

00:09.410 --> 00:11.445
but I-I hope
that we can be friends again.

00:11.479 --> 00:13.181
I guess we kind of have to,

00:13.214 --> 00:15.449
if only for the sake
of the town, right?

00:15.483 --> 00:17.185
Vivian went away
with Charles.

00:17.218 --> 00:18.786
They're looking for houses
in Baton Rouge.
You could've

00:18.819 --> 00:20.688
stopped this.
She would've listened to you.

00:20.721 --> 00:22.090
What was I supposed to do?

00:22.123 --> 00:24.258
I asked you one favor.

00:24.292 --> 00:25.193
It wouldn't have worked.

00:30.798 --> 00:33.301
(birds chirping)

00:35.169 --> 00:37.271
Good morning, neighbor.

00:37.305 --> 00:39.507
Is it? 'Cause I just tripped
and fell in that hole

00:39.540 --> 00:42.276
that Joel dug trying
to give Lavon a "water feature"

00:42.310 --> 00:44.345
and twisted my ankle. Again.

00:44.378 --> 00:45.846
Well, let me take a look.
Maybe I can fix it.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.081
The only thing
I want you to fix,

00:47.115 --> 00:49.283
Zoe, is that damn hole.
Look,

00:49.317 --> 00:51.452
Wade, I know that you feel
like I let you down, but...

00:51.485 --> 00:53.287
I was just trying
to help you.

00:53.321 --> 00:54.488
I didn't want you to get hurt.

00:54.522 --> 00:57.091
Yeah, well, guess what. I did.

00:57.125 --> 00:58.292
I know.

00:58.326 --> 01:00.494
But the truth is,
it was out of my hands.

01:00.528 --> 01:02.396
Yours, too.
No matter what

01:02.430 --> 01:05.399
either one of us did,
Charles and Vivian...

01:05.433 --> 01:07.801
Look, Zoe, I get you were
only trying to help, all right?

01:07.835 --> 01:10.171
But, let's face facts,
it's probably better

01:10.204 --> 01:12.873
that I don't interact with you
or any of your relations.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.775
That's not fair.
Maybe not.

01:14.808 --> 01:16.777
But I probably should have
adopted this policy

01:16.810 --> 01:17.778
five months ago.

01:17.811 --> 01:19.780
Better yet, three years ago.

01:19.813 --> 01:21.815
(sighs)

01:24.152 --> 01:25.753
(sighs)

01:27.321 --> 01:29.223
LEMON:
Well, if it
isn't my partner.

01:29.257 --> 01:31.725
How nice of you to stop
by and steal our coffee

01:31.759 --> 01:33.127
while I spend
the morning taking

01:33.161 --> 01:33.994
phone calls from customers

01:34.027 --> 01:35.463
canceling
their dinner reservations.

01:35.496 --> 01:36.464
Oh, no.

01:36.497 --> 01:37.898
No, that's not because of...

01:37.931 --> 01:39.867
The big "C" that
the health department gave us

01:39.900 --> 01:41.769
because you had sex
in our kitchen?

01:41.802 --> 01:42.803
Shockingly, yes.

01:42.836 --> 01:46.307
Yes, and I am so very sorry
about that, Lemon.

01:46.340 --> 01:48.309
Well, you should be.
Because that "C,"

01:48.342 --> 01:51.879
compounded with the fact that
stupid Le Pain Perdu in Mobile

01:51.912 --> 01:53.881
is getting rave reviews
on stupid Walter Wallen's

01:53.914 --> 01:56.417
stupid food blog, is driving
our customers elsewhere

01:56.450 --> 01:58.219
and making me irate!
Wait,

01:58.252 --> 01:59.353
Walter Wallen?
I-I love that guy.

01:59.387 --> 02:01.355
I didn't know he was reviewing
restaurants in the area.

02:01.389 --> 02:02.723
Well, of course
you didn't.

02:02.756 --> 02:05.493
And, of course, because we have
no publicity machine,

02:05.526 --> 02:07.495
Walter Wallen's probably
on his way to Fairhope

02:07.528 --> 02:09.497
to review Olive and Sage.

02:09.530 --> 02:11.499
And what? You want me
to be that publicity machine?

02:11.532 --> 02:14.468
Lemon, we agreed that I would be
more of a silent partner here.
Yes, well,

02:14.502 --> 02:17.371
a silent partner would not
have sullied our reputation

02:17.405 --> 02:20.408
along with our kitchen.
Okay, you, George Tucker,

02:20.441 --> 02:22.810
are a loud, honking albatross.

02:28.882 --> 02:30.784
BRICK:
Whoa.
Right on time.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.786
Good heavens,
what on earth is wrong?

02:32.820 --> 02:36.224
Wanda had an... unexpected guest
from Down Under.

02:36.257 --> 02:37.525
Uh, Hugh Jackman?

02:37.558 --> 02:39.927
(sighs)
I wish. That man can dance.
Tom means

02:39.960 --> 02:43.197
I got my period. He's not
very good with the lady terms.

02:43.231 --> 02:46.534
Oh, Wanda, I know
how disappointing that can be,

02:46.567 --> 02:49.203
but... thi-this doesn't mean
anything in the larger picture.

02:49.237 --> 02:50.804
We'll get you on a new cycle
of clomiphene

02:50.838 --> 02:52.206
and we'll try again.

02:52.240 --> 02:53.441
See? Hope is not lost.

02:53.474 --> 02:54.542
That stuff
made me crazy.

02:54.575 --> 02:56.810
If we can't have
a baby without it,

02:56.844 --> 02:58.246
then we won't have a baby.

02:58.279 --> 03:00.448
I already have a goat.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.822
Hey, George.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.224
I need your help.

03:10.258 --> 03:11.292
Yeah. Not now.

03:11.325 --> 03:14.362
Okay, what can I do to show Wade
that I'm his friend?

03:14.395 --> 03:17.431
No. Not going there. Besides,

03:17.465 --> 03:19.900
I am busy trying to find
Mr. Walter Wallen.

03:19.933 --> 03:22.903
Oh, I love his blog. But isn't
he always super secretive

03:22.936 --> 03:24.438
about where he's going?
Yes.

03:24.472 --> 03:26.840
But by using advanced
methods of deduction,

03:26.874 --> 03:28.742
I think I have figured
out the man's pattern.

03:28.776 --> 03:32.480
You see, he never eats the same
type of food twice in one week,

03:32.513 --> 03:35.549
and he moves in
a counterclockwise spiral path

03:35.583 --> 03:38.819
through every county that
he's been through, from coast

03:38.852 --> 03:41.455
to capital.
So, with that in mind,

03:41.489 --> 03:43.257
I think I have been able
to triangulate

03:43.291 --> 03:44.358
where he's gonna be next.

03:45.826 --> 03:48.962
(chuckles)
Okay, super nerd.

03:48.996 --> 03:51.732
But once you find out
where he's going,

03:51.765 --> 03:53.467
how are you gonna know
who he is?

03:53.501 --> 03:54.968
(sighs)
Well, that's
the easy part.

03:55.002 --> 03:57.305
He will be the man dining alone
at a table

03:57.338 --> 03:59.473
with every item on the menu
in front of him.

03:59.507 --> 04:01.342
That's a lot of effort
for one review.

04:01.375 --> 04:04.478
(sighs)
Yeah, well, getting
a Five Forks review for Fancie's

04:04.512 --> 04:06.280
from Walter Wallen
is the only way to...

04:06.314 --> 04:07.247
make things up to Lemon, so...

04:07.281 --> 04:11.519
Yeah. Yeah, no,
I-I heard about that whole...

04:11.552 --> 04:14.288
human ice cream sundae
situation.

04:14.322 --> 04:17.524
I don't know, George. Seems
kind of like a ridiculous plan.

04:17.558 --> 04:20.728
Well, it's the only plan I got.

04:20.761 --> 04:23.931
See you.
(clears throat)

04:23.964 --> 04:28.802
Well, I ho... I hope it's not
one big fat waste of time!

04:33.874 --> 04:36.344
(car horn honks)

04:36.377 --> 04:38.446

 Media Access Group at WGBH
access.wgbh.org

04:47.955 --> 04:49.857
Oh, hey, A.B.

04:49.890 --> 04:51.492
Good
to see you.

04:51.525 --> 04:52.760
So, um...

04:52.793 --> 04:54.328
what's new?

04:54.362 --> 04:57.398
Not much. Oh, my parents
are visiting this weekend.

04:57.431 --> 04:59.032
Oh, hey, uh,
how was their retirement cruise?

04:59.066 --> 05:01.369
Hey, did they see
any orcas in Alaska?

05:01.402 --> 05:02.269
Did they ever get rid
of that guy

05:02.302 --> 05:04.071
in the next cabin
with the yappy dog?

05:04.972 --> 05:06.173
(chuckles)
Oh, yeah.

05:06.206 --> 05:09.377
Uh, your parents and I kind of
had this e-mail thing going.

05:09.410 --> 05:11.812
I haven't heard
from 'em lately, though.

05:11.845 --> 05:14.815
They're actually meeting Davis
today.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.083
Whoa.

05:16.116 --> 05:19.052
Didn't realize
y'all were so serious.

05:19.086 --> 05:21.455
We are. It's a big day.

05:23.591 --> 05:25.926
Oh, which
just got bigger.

05:25.959 --> 05:28.128
Seems like he's about
to meet you, too.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.930
Hi, sweetie.

05:29.963 --> 05:32.400
Um, Davis,
this is Lavon.

05:32.433 --> 05:33.567
Lavon, Davis.

05:33.601 --> 05:36.837
Nice, uh, to...
finally meet you.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.472
(chuckles)
You, too.
Yeah.

05:38.506 --> 05:40.040
(clears throat)

05:40.073 --> 05:43.511
Well, I'm gonna get going,
let y'all enjoy your day.

05:46.079 --> 05:47.415
I shouldn't have done that.
What?

05:47.448 --> 05:48.949
I overdid it with the handshake.

05:48.982 --> 05:50.851
Squeezed a little too hard.
I might've hurt him.

05:50.884 --> 05:53.153
You think you squeezed
Lavon Hayes' hand too hard

05:53.186 --> 05:54.154
and hurt him?

05:54.187 --> 05:56.424
With a handshake?
Yeah, if you see him later,

05:56.457 --> 05:57.991
just apologize
for me, okay?

05:58.025 --> 05:59.793
You're joking.

05:59.827 --> 06:01.529
I bet your hand
is killing you.

06:01.562 --> 06:03.797
Have you seen that guy?
Of course it is.

06:03.831 --> 06:06.400
Aw, walk it
off, sweetie.

06:07.435 --> 06:08.969
(knocking)

06:10.971 --> 06:13.941
Uh... All right, already.

06:13.974 --> 06:15.075
All right!

06:16.510 --> 06:17.778
Good morning.

06:17.811 --> 06:19.880
I just came
to check up on you again.

06:19.913 --> 06:22.049
Well, that's great,
but I'm fine.

06:22.082 --> 06:24.585
Just like I was yesterday
when you checked up on me

06:24.618 --> 06:26.053
and the day before.

06:26.086 --> 06:27.421
Well,

06:27.455 --> 06:28.489
you don't look fine.

06:28.522 --> 06:30.558
(inhales)
Or smell fine.

06:30.591 --> 06:31.825
Again, thank you.

06:31.859 --> 06:33.026
I have
an idea.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.563
You have heartbreak,
and I have...

06:35.596 --> 06:36.930
hostility.

06:36.964 --> 06:38.799
So how 'bout we both
take the day off

06:38.832 --> 06:40.400
and have a little fun for once?

06:41.602 --> 06:43.571
Like Ferris Bueller?

06:43.604 --> 06:46.006
Is that the one where the kid
gets left home alone?

06:46.039 --> 06:47.975
No, that would be Home Alone.

06:48.008 --> 06:50.511
Ferris Bueller then!
We play hooky.

06:52.045 --> 06:54.515
You know what?

06:54.548 --> 06:56.984
I kind of love it.

06:57.017 --> 06:59.787
Great! I'll even let you pick
where we go first.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.121
And...

07:01.154 --> 07:03.023
do not say "strip club."
Strip club?

07:09.863 --> 07:11.565
Dorrie,
Gerald, hi!

07:11.599 --> 07:14.167
AnnaBeth told me you'd be
visiting. How are you?

07:14.201 --> 07:16.169
Lavon. Hey. Hello.
Oh, yeah. We're good. Fine.

07:16.203 --> 07:17.070
How was Alaska?

07:17.104 --> 07:19.072
Oh, yes, Alaska.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.874
It was cold.
Very cold.

07:20.908 --> 07:22.576
So cold.

07:22.610 --> 07:24.578
I see.

07:24.612 --> 07:29.583
Well, uh, I hope you enjoy
the warm BlueBell hospitality.

07:29.617 --> 07:31.985
Y'all-y'all take care.

07:35.523 --> 07:39.560
Lavon, wait. I'm sorry. We
tried to be angry at you,

07:39.593 --> 07:41.161
but we can't be. We miss you!

07:41.194 --> 07:43.130
I know! Me, too!
(chuckles)

07:46.867 --> 07:48.869
Dr. Breeland?

07:48.902 --> 07:50.504
You might want to come.
We have a situation.

07:55.609 --> 07:58.979
Oh, Lordy, she's pushing
an empty baby carriage?

07:59.012 --> 08:02.082
Oh, I wish. I wish. Hey,

08:02.115 --> 08:04.985
sweetie, why don't you show
Brick what's in the, uh,

08:05.018 --> 08:07.087
baby stroller?
Of course.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.089
Isn't he wonderful?

08:09.122 --> 08:10.057
(shouts)

08:10.090 --> 08:11.058
(bleats)

08:11.091 --> 08:12.259
It's a goat.

08:12.292 --> 08:14.061
In a onesie.

08:14.094 --> 08:15.062
Your point?

08:15.095 --> 08:17.965
Oh. Nothing.
Nothing. No point.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.266
No point.
Uh,

08:19.299 --> 08:20.868
adorable.
(chuckles)

08:20.901 --> 08:22.302
(bleats)

08:22.335 --> 08:24.304
Oh...

08:24.337 --> 08:26.874
Yes, it is a situation.

08:26.907 --> 08:30.243
Now, just let me... let me try
and figure something out.

08:30.277 --> 08:33.280
Please hurry. I cannot teach
a goat to ride a bike.

08:33.313 --> 08:36.283
Probably.

08:36.316 --> 08:38.284
LEMON:
 This is where you wanted to go?

08:38.318 --> 08:41.288
I was thinking more along
the lines of a spa or a museum.

08:41.321 --> 08:43.591
Well, you're not gonna see
a cougar with a top hat

08:43.624 --> 08:45.759
and a monocle in any museum.

08:45.793 --> 08:49.062
You know, it's almost like he's
saying something about society.

08:49.096 --> 08:51.131
Yeah, I love it here.
(chuckles)

08:51.164 --> 08:53.166
(sighs)
Fine. Then I get

08:53.200 --> 08:55.235
to pick the lunch spot next
because I'm starving.

08:55.268 --> 08:56.604
Well, lucky for
you, young lady,

08:56.637 --> 08:58.972
this taxidermy shop
also serves food.

08:59.006 --> 09:01.174
The boneless chicken
wings are amazing.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.877
No. You've got
to be kidding.

09:03.911 --> 09:06.046
Carpe chicken
wing, young lady.

09:06.079 --> 09:08.916
Come on.

09:17.625 --> 09:19.059
George Tucker.

09:19.092 --> 09:21.228
Why, hello.

09:21.261 --> 09:23.797
What are you doing here?
(sighs)
Well,

09:23.831 --> 09:26.066
certainly not staking out
a prominent restaurant reviewer,

09:26.099 --> 09:27.200
if that's what you're thinking.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.869
You followed me?
And it took

09:28.902 --> 09:29.870
forever, by the way.

09:29.903 --> 09:32.072
You take those complete stops
very seriously.

09:32.105 --> 09:35.142
Listen, Zoe,
I'm not playing here, okay?

09:35.175 --> 09:37.210
I am here for business.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.379
And so am I.
I'm going to get Walter Wallen

09:39.412 --> 09:40.814
to review the Rammer Jammer.

09:40.848 --> 09:43.083
And I'm going to get Wade
to forgive me.

09:43.116 --> 09:43.817
No.

09:43.851 --> 09:44.952
No!

09:44.985 --> 09:47.821
No, these are my advanced
cartographic calculations.

09:47.855 --> 09:50.090
You can't just...
It's no use arguing.

09:50.123 --> 09:51.224
We are at an impasse.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.860
I am here, and I'm not leaving.

09:52.893 --> 09:54.962
I would say that you could
leave, only you can't

09:54.995 --> 09:56.964
because I don't know
how to get home. So there.

09:56.997 --> 09:58.632
Oh, no. No, no.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.307
Um, movies aren't a great
conversation starter either.

10:07.340 --> 10:09.877
Uh, my parents tapped
out after Top Gun.

10:09.910 --> 10:11.945
They figured they'd
never see anything better.

10:11.979 --> 10:13.847
Stop worrying.
I'm great with parents.

10:13.881 --> 10:15.983
They totally dig me.

10:16.016 --> 10:17.885
It's 'cause I used
the word "dig," isn't it?

10:17.918 --> 10:19.219
Partially. Also,

10:19.252 --> 10:20.988
maybe lose the vest?

10:21.021 --> 10:21.922
Seriously?

10:21.955 --> 10:24.324
Well, people your parents' age
really dig...

10:24.357 --> 10:26.293
really respond to this vest.

10:26.326 --> 10:27.294
(knocking)

10:27.327 --> 10:29.329
Losing the vest!

10:32.099 --> 10:33.867
(exhales sharply)

10:33.901 --> 10:35.335
(clears throat softly)

10:35.368 --> 10:37.204
Hello!
Hi!

10:37.237 --> 10:39.072
Oh, it's so great
to see you!
Hi, darling. How are you?

10:39.106 --> 10:40.107
Mwah!
Hi, honey.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.309
Hello! Mwah! Oh,

10:42.342 --> 10:44.277
uh, Mom and Dad,
this is Davis.

10:44.311 --> 10:45.813
Davis, this is my mom and dad.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.214
Or, um,
Gerald and Dorrie,

10:47.247 --> 10:49.316
as they are known
to people who aren't me.

10:49.349 --> 10:51.384
It's so nice to meet you.

10:51.418 --> 10:52.886
I'd ask you
to tell me about

10:52.920 --> 10:54.321
your cruise,
but AnnaBeth's been letting me

10:54.354 --> 10:55.555
see all the photos you sent.

10:55.588 --> 11:00.093
Oh. Well, then I guess we have
nothing to talk about, then.

11:00.127 --> 11:01.194
(both chuckling)

11:01.228 --> 11:04.031
(awkward chuckle)

11:04.064 --> 11:05.098
Yeah.

11:05.132 --> 11:06.299
Shall we sit?

11:06.333 --> 11:08.802
Yes! We love sitting!

11:08.836 --> 11:10.237
Oh, and pastries!

11:10.270 --> 11:13.273
Yay, yay, they make
everything better.

11:13.306 --> 11:15.909
(exhaling repeatedly)

11:15.943 --> 11:18.278
ZOE:
 George, we've been
 waiting here for an hour.

11:18.311 --> 11:20.313
Your map is wrong.
No. My map
is not wrong.

11:20.347 --> 11:21.949
Will you just let me
see that thing?

11:21.982 --> 11:23.917
No! This is... no,
this is my thing.

11:23.951 --> 11:26.053
This is not your thing.
You are an interloper.

11:26.086 --> 11:27.354
(sighs)

11:28.956 --> 11:30.991
ZOE:
Hey, George,

11:31.024 --> 11:33.093
what did you say
Walter Wallen
would look like?

11:33.126 --> 11:34.427
Nice try, Zoe.

11:34.461 --> 11:36.964
Sitting alone at a table
with every single dish

11:36.997 --> 11:38.966
on the menu?
Okay, stop talking.

11:39.967 --> 11:41.234
And... stop tapping!

11:41.268 --> 11:43.036
Just look over there.

11:46.206 --> 11:49.209
See? I told you
the map works.

11:49.242 --> 11:50.978
The map is alive!

11:54.948 --> 11:56.917
You know, maybe you're right.

11:56.950 --> 11:58.952
Uh, this place
is kind of creepy.

11:58.986 --> 12:00.353
(drops fork)
You want to go?

12:00.387 --> 12:01.221
Yes.

12:01.254 --> 12:03.356
MAN:
Uh, excuse me, uh,

12:03.390 --> 12:08.061
could you tell me how to get
to Olive and Sage in Fairhope?

12:08.095 --> 12:10.964
Wade Kinsella,
I could kiss you.

12:10.998 --> 12:12.966
Please don't. And why?

12:13.000 --> 12:15.335
If I'm not mistaken,
we have just been joined

12:15.368 --> 12:18.171
by the famous restaurant blogger
Walter Wallen!

12:18.205 --> 12:19.106
(chuckles): All right.

12:19.139 --> 12:21.108
Huh!

12:21.141 --> 12:23.010
SHELBY:
 Brick Breeland...

12:23.043 --> 12:24.845
Shelby?

12:24.878 --> 12:26.847
Surprise! It's us!

12:26.880 --> 12:28.448
Oh-ho...

12:28.481 --> 12:29.917
Oh-ho...

12:29.950 --> 12:31.919
My word.

12:31.952 --> 12:35.388
And this little angel
must be Ethel.

12:35.422 --> 12:39.126
Those dimples, they
would melt an igloo.

12:39.159 --> 12:41.962
She was just dying to meet
her Uncle Bricky, so...

12:41.995 --> 12:44.231
I drove her down
to BlueBell.
Well,

12:44.264 --> 12:46.033
may I say, motherhood
agrees with you.

12:46.066 --> 12:47.134
You look wonderful.

12:47.167 --> 12:49.002
Oh, well, I feel wonderful.

12:49.036 --> 12:52.439
Everything they say about a baby
changing your life is true.

12:52.472 --> 12:55.142
Well, you know, I can't wait
to catch up and hear it all,

12:55.175 --> 12:56.443
but I have patients all day.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.979
Maybe we could get together
for an early dinner?

12:59.012 --> 13:01.148
I would love that.

13:01.181 --> 13:03.216
But we have to go
somewhere baby-friendly.

13:04.251 --> 13:06.887
Actually... if you
need a break,

13:06.920 --> 13:10.323
I know the perfect people to
look after your precious bundle.

13:10.357 --> 13:12.292
Really? Oh, 'cause, well...

13:12.325 --> 13:15.295
I love my baby,
but an evening off
would be sublime.

13:15.328 --> 13:17.330
Well, I promise
it's a favor to them

13:17.364 --> 13:18.932
as much as for you.

13:18.966 --> 13:20.267
(laughs):
Well, you are on.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.469
Good. I'll call you.
Okay.

13:24.471 --> 13:27.908
Tom, tell Wanda to put
that goat out to pasture,

13:27.941 --> 13:30.010
'cause she is
about to fall in love

13:30.043 --> 13:32.379
with a real live human being.

13:32.412 --> 13:34.047
A podcast?

13:34.081 --> 13:36.416
Uh, yes, ma'am.
I-I host it
once a week.

13:36.449 --> 13:39.186
What the heck's
a podcast?
ANNABETH: Um,

13:39.219 --> 13:41.054
it's kind of like a radio show.

13:41.088 --> 13:42.923
Yeah, uh, but-but
for the Internet.

13:42.956 --> 13:44.357
Mine's about DIY.

13:44.391 --> 13:45.625
D-I-Y?

13:45.658 --> 13:47.060
Do It Yourself.

13:47.094 --> 13:48.862
Yeah, I-I talk about
all sorts of things

13:48.896 --> 13:52.265
you can, um-- spoiler
alert-- do yourself.

13:52.299 --> 13:53.266
(laughter)

13:53.300 --> 13:55.068
Well... (chuckles)

13:55.102 --> 13:57.637
So, how about football--
are you a football fan?

13:57.670 --> 14:00.273
Well, that's the one with
the oval ball, right?

14:02.675 --> 14:04.277
I'm kidding!

14:04.311 --> 14:06.947
No, Davis comes from
a football-loving family

14:06.980 --> 14:08.148
just like ours.
Yeah.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.918
But honestly, I think
the sport might

14:10.951 --> 14:12.019
go away entirely in five years.

14:12.052 --> 14:14.354
I mean, now that we know
all about those concussions.

14:14.387 --> 14:17.324
It makes it so hard
to watch, doesn't it?

14:19.259 --> 14:21.461
He's kidding!

14:21.494 --> 14:24.231
Oh, without football, what
would we do with our Sundays?

14:24.264 --> 14:26.099
Am I right?
Amen!

14:26.133 --> 14:27.467
Who wants to
go for a walk?

14:27.500 --> 14:29.469
It is a beautiful day.
I-I'd love a walk.

14:29.502 --> 14:33.907
Oh, actually, we're still
getting our sea legs, or...

14:33.941 --> 14:35.342
land legs, I suppose.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.978
You know, a nap
would fix us right up.
Mm.

14:38.011 --> 14:39.246
Oh, but y'all just got here.

14:39.279 --> 14:42.015
Oh, don't you worry, BananaBeth,
we'll be back this afternoon.

14:42.049 --> 14:45.986
Oh, uh, g-good.
'Cause I make a mean
three-bean chili.

14:46.019 --> 14:47.454
The trick-- four beans!

14:47.487 --> 14:49.122
Oh, four.

14:49.156 --> 14:51.458
Well, that just sounds great.
How nice.

14:53.326 --> 14:55.328
(big sigh)

14:56.329 --> 14:58.966
I-I know,
concussions--

14:58.999 --> 15:01.334
what was I thinking?
Oh, they're just tired.

15:01.368 --> 15:04.271
Besides, they have all night
to get to like you

15:04.304 --> 15:06.273
just as much as I do.

15:06.306 --> 15:09.009
Well... maybe not quite as much.

15:09.042 --> 15:11.178
Oh. Mmm.
Come here.

15:12.212 --> 15:13.680
Gerald.

15:13.713 --> 15:15.715
Dorrie. Uh, twice
in one day.
(chuckles)

15:15.748 --> 15:18.251
Uh, to what do I
owe the pleasure?

15:18.285 --> 15:21.054
Well, it was just so nice
running into you earlier,

15:21.088 --> 15:23.490
and, well...
Well, w-we had some free time
this afternoon,

15:23.523 --> 15:26.293
thought maybe
we could catch up, hang out.

15:26.326 --> 15:27.394
I-I'd love that!

15:27.427 --> 15:29.963
Oh, but wait,
is A.B okay with it?

15:29.997 --> 15:32.065
I mean, you are here to see her.

15:32.099 --> 15:34.034
Oh, we were just there.
Oh, she's fine.

15:35.335 --> 15:37.704
(chuckles):
Well, all right, come on in.

15:39.372 --> 15:42.042
WADE:
Well, it kind of does look like

15:42.075 --> 15:44.311
he sits inside all day--
so he's either a blogger

15:44.344 --> 15:46.446
or... I don't know,
serial killer.

15:46.479 --> 15:49.716
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go convince him
to review Fancie's.

15:49.749 --> 15:51.484
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, not so fast.

15:51.518 --> 15:54.187
If this guy can do so
much for restaurants,

15:54.221 --> 15:56.223
maybe I want him reviewing
the Rammer Jammer.

15:56.256 --> 15:59.059
No. Walter Wallen never reviews
more than one place in any town,

15:59.092 --> 16:00.727
and after what
George did to our kitchen,

16:00.760 --> 16:02.762
Fancie's needs
all the help it can get.

16:02.795 --> 16:05.698
Um, Lemon, I don't mean
to play the broken heart card,

16:05.732 --> 16:10.103
but mine is crushed, shattered,
possibly destroyed.

16:11.138 --> 16:12.439
Fine.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.374
(quietly):
Yes.
We both work together.

16:14.407 --> 16:16.109
Both reviews or nothing.

16:16.143 --> 16:17.310
You are a good friend.

16:17.344 --> 16:18.711
Yeah, yeah.
Now, tuck in your shirt

16:18.745 --> 16:20.280
and wipe the wing sauce
from your chin,

16:20.313 --> 16:21.681
because we need
to look presentable.

16:21.714 --> 16:23.250
That's not gonna happen.

16:26.086 --> 16:28.488
GEORGE:
You cannot seriously believe
that your situation

16:28.521 --> 16:30.357
is more important than mine.

16:30.390 --> 16:32.259
Oh, I can, because it is.
Wade needs it.

16:32.292 --> 16:34.361
And I need it
to show him how much I care.

16:34.394 --> 16:35.762
Well, Lemon needs this.

16:35.795 --> 16:39.699
And, also,
that other thing, too.

16:39.732 --> 16:42.469
Well, fine. I guess it's just
every person for themselves.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.237
What?! No!

16:44.271 --> 16:45.405
Zoe, Zoe...

16:45.438 --> 16:47.307
Zoe!
(shrieks)

16:48.241 --> 16:49.209
(groans)

16:51.344 --> 16:52.345
(both groan)

17:04.090 --> 17:05.758
LEMON (laughs):
We promise that we

17:05.791 --> 17:09.061
won't say anything, but you're
Walter Wallen, aren't you?

17:09.096 --> 17:10.329
Who?
Come on, pal,
let's see

17:10.363 --> 17:11.330
your driver's license.

17:11.364 --> 17:12.732
Come on.
No!

17:12.765 --> 17:14.334
(laughs):
Oh, he's just kidding.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.769
I was gonna say,
if you were Walter Wallen,

17:16.803 --> 17:20.507
I would tell you that I read
your blog daily. Your article

17:20.540 --> 17:22.442
about the nation's
ludicrous fixation

17:22.474 --> 17:24.711
with kale changed my life.

17:24.743 --> 17:26.146
Me, too.

17:26.179 --> 17:27.347
Kale, right?

17:27.380 --> 17:29.182
Boo!

17:29.216 --> 17:30.517
Thank you.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.185
And it was obviously

17:32.219 --> 17:34.354
a controversial stance
to take, you know?
Right.

17:34.387 --> 17:37.090
It was bold,
it was visionary. Dauntless.

17:37.124 --> 17:39.292
(whispers):
What's kale?

17:39.326 --> 17:41.328
(chuckles)
Where are you two from?

17:41.361 --> 17:43.130
Well...
A little slice
of heaven

17:43.163 --> 17:45.765
about an hour from here
called BlueBell. Mm-hmm.

17:45.798 --> 17:48.168
I've heard great things.

17:48.201 --> 17:50.170
Why, as it happens,
she and I are

17:50.203 --> 17:52.872
world-class
restauranteurs there.
Mm-hmm.

17:52.905 --> 17:56.243
Running into two
restaurant owners from BlueBell?

17:56.276 --> 17:57.310
I know.

17:57.344 --> 17:58.811
That seems like a sign.

17:58.845 --> 18:01.114
Tell me about it.
From the Lord.

18:01.148 --> 18:03.350
Do you want to take me to lunch?
Let's do it!

18:03.383 --> 18:05.252
(chuckles):
Come on, you dog!

18:05.285 --> 18:07.787
Arf.

18:07.820 --> 18:10.123
After you.

18:12.159 --> 18:14.194
Are you two okay?

18:14.227 --> 18:16.329
I saw that tumble you took.

18:16.363 --> 18:17.797
We're great.
We're fine.

18:17.830 --> 18:19.766
Oh. Good. Feel better.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.000
Uh, wait, sir...

18:21.033 --> 18:23.736
I understand how much
you appreciate your
anonymity, but...

18:23.770 --> 18:25.472
Oh, let me just say,
Mr. Wallen,

18:25.505 --> 18:27.507
that I am an enormous fan.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.342
(chuckles):
Is that so?

18:29.376 --> 18:31.378
Not as big of a fan
as I am, though. You see,

18:31.411 --> 18:33.480
as a matter of fact,
I've been trying
to track you down.

18:33.513 --> 18:35.748
Well, little stalker-ish,
if you ask me.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.284
Well, she followed me here,
so I don't really know

18:37.317 --> 18:39.486
who's calling who
a stalker in this situation.

18:39.519 --> 18:41.254
The point is, Mr. Wallen,

18:41.288 --> 18:43.356
that...
That any trip
to Mobile Bay

18:43.390 --> 18:45.525
would not be complete
without stopping by

18:45.558 --> 18:48.328
Fancie's in BlueBell.
The food there...

18:48.361 --> 18:49.762
Is very pretentious,

18:49.796 --> 18:50.997
in my opinion.

18:51.030 --> 18:54.301
But do you know what else is
in BlueBell? The Rammer Jammer.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.403
Very authentic.
Oh, the things they fry.

18:56.436 --> 18:58.405
It's so interesting
you say BlueBell.

18:58.438 --> 19:00.473
I was thinking
of just stopping by.

19:00.507 --> 19:03.743
The only problem is, my...
my car just broke down.

19:03.776 --> 19:04.811
I'll drive you.
I'll drive you.

19:04.844 --> 19:06.313
Oh...

19:06.979 --> 19:09.382
Or... George can drive you,

19:09.416 --> 19:12.285
and I'll come with,
pick up my car tomorrow.

19:12.319 --> 19:13.853
ZOE:
Yeah, you know,
'cause that's me.

19:13.886 --> 19:14.921
I'm easy breezy.

19:14.954 --> 19:18.258
ZOE:
Have I told you how much
I like your shirt?

19:18.291 --> 19:20.193
Oh...
(laughs)

19:20.227 --> 19:21.894
I j... uh, me, too.

19:21.928 --> 19:23.530
Easy breezy.

19:23.563 --> 19:24.964
ANNABETH:
It...

19:24.997 --> 19:26.399
it really is strange--

19:26.433 --> 19:28.201
they're generally
very prompt people.

19:28.235 --> 19:29.936
Yeah, I'm sure
they're on their way.

19:29.969 --> 19:32.205
Hey, hit me with that tomatillo.
Oh. Uh-huh.

19:32.239 --> 19:33.906
(sings quietly)

19:33.940 --> 19:35.775
Oh. Thank you.

19:35.808 --> 19:37.810
Oh, I have to admit,
you had some killer moves

19:37.844 --> 19:41.381
out there, Gerald.
Yeah, there's some juice
still left in the old tank.

19:41.414 --> 19:43.416
Not much, by the sound of
that huffin' and puffin'!

19:43.450 --> 19:45.385
(laughs)
Oh, that was a blast.

19:45.418 --> 19:46.953
You know, I can't
remember the last time

19:46.986 --> 19:49.322
I got to throw the ball
around with my old man.

19:49.356 --> 19:50.957
Well, no doubt
they're proud of you.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.459
We sure as heck are.

19:52.492 --> 19:54.427
You've had quite a year--
the Renaissance Faire,

19:54.461 --> 19:57.230
the French delegation,
and most important,

19:57.264 --> 19:59.432
stopping the merger--
you saved this town

19:59.466 --> 20:01.301
from the Gaineys,
from extinction.

20:01.334 --> 20:02.402
Amen.

20:02.435 --> 20:03.836
Thank you for being so kind.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.473
But actually I feel
like it's been a rocky year.

20:06.506 --> 20:09.542
I lost the county fair,
nearly lost the town.

20:09.576 --> 20:12.812
And worst, I lost your daughter.

20:12.845 --> 20:14.847
Any chance you and A.B. w...?

20:14.881 --> 20:17.350
No. Sorry to say.

20:17.384 --> 20:21.321
Well, still, we always want you
to be a part of our life.

20:21.354 --> 20:22.322
Well...

20:22.355 --> 20:24.257
that means the world to me.

20:24.291 --> 20:26.859
I mean, especially
since you're in town to...

20:26.893 --> 20:29.762
meet A.B.'s
new boyfriend, right?

20:29.796 --> 20:31.798
Uh-huh.
Sure are.

20:32.899 --> 20:35.268
I just need to make
a quick call.

20:35.302 --> 20:37.003
I'll be right back.

20:37.036 --> 20:39.272
She just needs
to make a quick call.

20:39.306 --> 20:40.873
She'll be right back.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.475
(quietly): All right.

20:42.509 --> 20:46.012
I-In good news,
the chili is better

20:46.045 --> 20:48.281
the longer it cooks.

20:48.315 --> 20:49.716
Maybe I should call
Sheriff Bill.

20:49.749 --> 20:52.785
(phone rings)
Not that he'd be able
to find them, but, you know...

20:52.819 --> 20:53.953
Oh. Oh.

20:53.986 --> 20:55.455
Thank the Lord.

20:55.488 --> 20:56.756
Mom?

20:56.789 --> 20:58.758
Oh, I'm so sorry, sweetheart.

20:58.791 --> 21:02.429
Your father and I...
overslept on our nap.

21:02.462 --> 21:04.764
Chalk it up to the boat lag.

21:04.797 --> 21:07.867
Well, up and at 'em, sailors.

21:10.370 --> 21:13.906
Davis put a lot of effort
into this meal.

21:13.940 --> 21:14.974
For you.

21:15.007 --> 21:16.909
We are on our way.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.345
Hey, who's in the mood

21:18.378 --> 21:19.912
for ice cream?
Can't say no to

21:19.946 --> 21:21.514
Rocky Road.

21:21.548 --> 21:23.450
Rocky Road?

21:23.483 --> 21:24.751
Are you kidding me?!

21:24.784 --> 21:27.387
You know what?
Stay at Lavon's.

21:27.420 --> 21:29.389
Your invitation
has been revoked.

21:30.823 --> 21:31.924
(exhales)

21:31.958 --> 21:33.793
In more good news,

21:33.826 --> 21:36.796
I make a killer leftover
chili casserole.

21:36.829 --> 21:38.965
I know.

21:38.998 --> 21:40.933
So, how you doing?

21:40.967 --> 21:42.034
Is the music okay?

21:42.068 --> 21:43.436
Um, is the
air conditioning good?

21:43.470 --> 21:45.772
I mean, if it's too much,
I can turn it down.

21:45.805 --> 21:46.873
It's definitely too much.
Oh,

21:46.906 --> 21:48.975
I'm fine, thanks.
Oh, my God.

21:49.008 --> 21:49.976
Did you see that?
No, what?

21:50.009 --> 21:52.345
On the side of the road.
I-I think it was a deer.

21:52.379 --> 21:53.380
Looked pretty bad,

21:53.413 --> 21:54.481
like it'd
been hurt.

21:56.583 --> 21:57.850
Wait, stop, st... Stop!

21:57.884 --> 21:58.918
All right.
GEORGE:
Okay, okay.

21:58.951 --> 21:59.919
Stop!
Okay.

21:59.952 --> 22:00.987
Do you mind if we pull over?

22:01.020 --> 22:02.121
Of course not.
Sure.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.890
Maybe I can help,
I'm a doctor.

22:03.923 --> 22:06.493
Oh.

22:07.894 --> 22:09.128
So...

22:09.161 --> 22:11.464
this is what George and Lemon

22:11.498 --> 22:13.032
have done with my Fancie's.

22:13.065 --> 22:15.768
Well, it certainly does
lack that special charm

22:15.802 --> 22:17.103
of your cabaret.

22:17.136 --> 22:18.371
(both laugh)

22:18.405 --> 22:19.872
So, tell me
everything. What is

22:19.906 --> 22:21.974
life like in Montgomery?

22:22.008 --> 22:23.843
Oh, I love it.

22:23.876 --> 22:26.913
I am plotting a production
of Little Mermaid

22:26.946 --> 22:27.947
done entirely underwater.

22:27.980 --> 22:30.483
And being squired around
by the lieutenant governor

22:30.517 --> 22:33.386
makes me feel like
Alabama royalty.

22:33.420 --> 22:35.822
Well.
We're not
romantically involved,

22:35.855 --> 22:36.856
if you were wondering.

22:36.889 --> 22:39.459
Uh, no, no. I was not.

22:39.492 --> 22:41.761
But he's a good father.

22:41.794 --> 22:43.863
Excellent tour giver.

22:43.896 --> 22:46.466
Well, great. Great, sounds
like you have it all.

22:46.499 --> 22:47.934
Well, the only thing
Montgomery's

22:47.967 --> 22:51.037
missing is the one thing that
I can only find in BlueBell.

22:51.070 --> 22:53.440
Oh, Dash's annual
 One Man Hamlet?

22:53.473 --> 22:55.074
No, Brick.

22:55.107 --> 22:56.142
You.

22:56.175 --> 22:57.477
(coughs)

22:57.510 --> 23:00.513
I want you back.
(coughs, exhales)

23:02.515 --> 23:03.916
GEORGE:
This is just a waste

23:03.950 --> 23:05.785
of time. That animal
probably already ran away.

23:05.818 --> 23:07.554
I cannot leave an injured
animal in the woods.

23:07.587 --> 23:09.021
I have the Hippocratic oath.

23:09.055 --> 23:10.590
Yeah, but not a
veterinarian's license,

23:10.623 --> 23:12.158
surprisingly.
Mr. Wallen,

23:12.191 --> 23:13.493
are you, uh... Are you sure

23:13.526 --> 23:15.194
that you saw the
animal in this

23:15.227 --> 23:16.563
area here?

23:17.964 --> 23:21.901
Sorry about this. But you two
just made it so easy.

23:23.069 --> 23:24.036
(cackles)
(engine starts)

23:24.070 --> 23:25.572
Wait, no.

23:25.605 --> 23:28.508
Bye, y'all.
No, no, no, no.

23:28.541 --> 23:29.842
No, that's my truck.

23:29.876 --> 23:32.979
That's my truck.
That's my truck. So...

23:36.048 --> 23:38.785
I have a feeling that wasn't
the true Walter Wallen.

23:38.818 --> 23:39.852
Just call somebody.

23:39.886 --> 23:41.420
'Cause my phone is in the truck.

23:42.622 --> 23:44.824
My phone is in there, too.

23:46.058 --> 23:48.895
It is 11 miles to BlueBell.

23:50.830 --> 23:52.965
Good thing I got
my hiking shoes on.

23:55.234 --> 23:56.869
George!

24:03.543 --> 24:05.812
The first steps inside
a restaurant speak volumes.

24:05.845 --> 24:08.080
Well, I hope this one
is saying good things to you.

24:08.114 --> 24:10.182
Oh, it certainly is.
The tasteful elegance

24:10.216 --> 24:12.952
is coming through
loud and clear.

24:12.985 --> 24:15.822
Well, the former owner turned
this place into a cabaret,

24:15.855 --> 24:17.857
so I went to extensive efforts

24:17.890 --> 24:20.827
to restore its sense
of class and refinement.

24:20.860 --> 24:22.094
Shelby.

24:22.128 --> 24:24.063
Daddy.

24:24.096 --> 24:26.065
What are you two
doing here? Together?

24:26.098 --> 24:27.967
BRICK: Oh, just grabbing dinner.
SHELBY: Oh, the usual.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.269
Just popped into town
to make your dad fall
back in love with me.

24:30.302 --> 24:32.772
What?
WADE: Uh, you know,
one of the great

24:32.805 --> 24:34.541
things about
Fancie's--

24:34.574 --> 24:37.076
the way it brings
together old friends.

24:37.109 --> 24:38.978
And new ones.

24:39.011 --> 24:41.914
Like our esteemed
guest here.
(exhales)

24:41.948 --> 24:43.950
Yes, of
course.

24:43.983 --> 24:46.218
Why don't I take you into
the main room so I can focus

24:46.252 --> 24:47.587
on showing you
the best of Fancie's

24:47.620 --> 24:48.755
without all
the distractions.

24:48.788 --> 24:52.859
Daddy, enjoy your meal.
And only your meal.

24:52.892 --> 24:55.161
Looks good,
don't mind if I do.

24:57.029 --> 24:59.098
Try not to
take it so hard.

24:59.131 --> 25:01.067
My parents
just know Lavon

25:01.100 --> 25:02.869
a little better
than you.

25:02.902 --> 25:04.303
Your parents adore him.

25:04.336 --> 25:06.205
You don't have to cover it up.

25:06.238 --> 25:08.775
It's infuriating.
No, it's fine.

25:08.808 --> 25:10.777
Honey, of course I want
to meet your parents.

25:10.810 --> 25:12.912
See where you come from.
It's important to me.

25:12.945 --> 25:14.013
And I will.

25:14.046 --> 25:15.314
We have time, but...

25:15.347 --> 25:18.017
spending, uh, another day
alone with you

25:18.050 --> 25:20.620
is pretty much a "W" for me.

25:20.653 --> 25:22.555
That's sports lingo I looked up.

25:22.589 --> 25:24.256
Oh. (chuckles)

25:24.290 --> 25:27.159
How come you are so
wonderful and levelheaded?

25:27.193 --> 25:30.129
Well, you forgot
handsome and charming.

25:30.162 --> 25:32.264
Oh, yes, mm-hmm.
That, too.

25:32.298 --> 25:34.266
Now, if you'll excuse me,

25:34.300 --> 25:37.103
I have some people who
need a talking to.

25:37.136 --> 25:38.805
(kiss)
Okay.

25:38.838 --> 25:40.840
Go get 'em.
Okay.

25:41.974 --> 25:44.611
God. (grunts)
(grunts)

25:44.644 --> 25:46.112
You know what?

25:46.145 --> 25:49.882
The authorities better find
my truck, or else, I swear...

25:49.916 --> 25:51.183
Don't blame me, okay?
'Cause your methods

25:51.217 --> 25:52.384
of triangulation stink.

25:52.418 --> 25:54.954
Hold on. You were the one
that was there distracting me.

25:54.987 --> 25:56.989
Okay? If you weren't there,
I would have figured out

25:57.023 --> 25:59.091
something was off
with that guy.
So now you're the Mentalist.

25:59.125 --> 26:00.359
You know... (growls)

26:00.392 --> 26:02.294
(car approaches)
Less talk,
more thumb. Hey!

26:02.328 --> 26:04.997
Hey!
Hey! (whistles)

26:09.168 --> 26:11.337
Yeah, I used to have
a truck like that,

26:11.370 --> 26:14.841
that I could drive us
home with, but, uh...
Shut...

26:14.874 --> 26:17.343
I don't understand why you're
being so difficult about this.

26:17.376 --> 26:19.812
People are always saying
we belong together.

26:19.846 --> 26:21.948
Who says that?
Everyone.

26:21.981 --> 26:24.951
Shelby, you left me
to go to Montgomery.

26:24.984 --> 26:27.219
And-And I mean
this in the kindest

26:27.253 --> 26:29.321
way possible, but...

26:29.355 --> 26:31.858
without you being in my life--

26:31.891 --> 26:33.960
it has been a huge relief.

26:33.993 --> 26:36.228
I d... I do not think
we are meant to be.

26:36.262 --> 26:38.297
But we are.

26:38.330 --> 26:40.066
We have to be.

26:40.099 --> 26:43.135
It's just hard.

26:43.169 --> 26:45.104
Everything is so hard.

26:45.137 --> 26:46.806
Alex is busy all the time.

26:46.839 --> 26:47.940
With what?

26:47.974 --> 26:50.109
He's the lieutenant governor.
He just has to sit around

26:50.142 --> 26:51.944
in case the governor-governor
gets shot.

26:51.978 --> 26:55.047
But at least you-you have
your beautiful baby.

26:55.081 --> 26:57.249
Oh, I love Ethel.

26:57.283 --> 26:58.150
When she's sleeping.

26:58.184 --> 27:00.386
Oh.
But the truth is,
when she's awake,

27:00.419 --> 27:03.122
she is terrifying.

27:03.155 --> 27:04.924
(wailing)

27:04.957 --> 27:08.928
Aah! This child's possessed.
Call Shelby.

27:08.961 --> 27:10.897
Have her come
and get it exorcised.

27:10.930 --> 27:13.132
TOM:
We cannot call Shelby.
We said we would babysit.

27:13.165 --> 27:15.267
And we will.
You want a baby so badly?

27:15.301 --> 27:16.869
You make it stop.

27:16.903 --> 27:18.337
Fine. Hi, baby.

27:18.370 --> 27:20.306
Uh, stop crying. Please stop
crying.

27:20.339 --> 27:22.041
Okay. I-I have cash.

27:22.074 --> 27:24.010
Okay... I...
it is not working.

27:24.043 --> 27:26.312
Oh, what, the cash bribe?
No, no, no.

27:26.345 --> 27:28.848
Brick and I thought that if
you spent time with Ethel,

27:28.881 --> 27:30.950
then you'd... then
you'd reconsider having

27:30.983 --> 27:32.018
a human infant.

27:32.051 --> 27:33.219
But this is the wrong baby.

27:33.252 --> 27:35.387
This is a bad one.
Oh, no,

27:35.421 --> 27:36.923
let's have ten of these.

27:36.956 --> 27:39.425
15.
Wanda, we have
to stick together.

27:39.458 --> 27:40.927
Otherwise the baby wins.

27:42.161 --> 27:44.096
* I like-a you

27:44.130 --> 27:45.798
* And you like-a me
(wailing fades)

27:45.832 --> 27:48.835
* And we like-a both the same
(quiet fussing)

27:48.868 --> 27:51.303
It's working.
(cooing)

27:51.337 --> 27:54.006
Course, she's
Shelby's kid.

27:54.040 --> 27:55.975
* I'd like to say

27:56.008 --> 27:57.309
* This very day

27:57.343 --> 28:01.047
* I'd like to share your name

28:01.080 --> 28:03.916
* 'Cause I love-a you

28:03.950 --> 28:06.052
* And you love-a me

28:06.085 --> 28:10.189
* And you love-a me the same
* And you love-a
both the same *

28:10.222 --> 28:11.924
* One live as two

28:11.958 --> 28:14.060
* Two live as one

28:14.093 --> 28:17.163
* Under the bamboo tree.

28:20.967 --> 28:22.334
A.B., hey.

28:22.368 --> 28:23.903
Oh, y-you just missed
your parents.

28:23.936 --> 28:26.839
Yes, I am well aware of that.

28:26.873 --> 28:29.441
Y-Your parents did
tell you they were here,

28:29.475 --> 28:31.143
didn't they?

28:31.177 --> 28:32.444
Oh, no.

28:32.478 --> 28:36.282
They were supposed to be
at my house. Davis cooked.

28:36.315 --> 28:37.817
Oh, no.

28:37.850 --> 28:40.352
I-I never would have had 'em
over if I knew, I swear.

28:40.386 --> 28:42.955
No, I-I'm not trying
to get in the middle.

28:42.989 --> 28:44.123
Again.

28:44.156 --> 28:45.357
My lesson has been learned.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.359
Mm, but yet again, you are.

28:47.393 --> 28:48.928
In the middle.

28:48.961 --> 28:50.162
Well, I can see that now.

28:50.196 --> 28:54.433
Lavon, do you get how hard it is
to be the boyfriend after you?

28:54.466 --> 28:55.835
What can I do?

28:55.868 --> 28:57.870
Oh, I'll tell you
what you can do.

29:02.308 --> 29:04.276
(sighs)

29:04.310 --> 29:07.079
* Ain't no gift
like the present tense *

29:07.113 --> 29:11.918
* Ain't no love
like an old romance *

29:11.951 --> 29:14.453
* Gots to make hay
when the sun is shinin' *

29:14.486 --> 29:18.057
* Can't waste time
when it comes time to dance *

29:20.159 --> 29:24.063
* Slammin' this door
with a heavy hand *

29:26.032 --> 29:27.433
Yeah, I call
that one the

29:27.466 --> 29:28.835
"Kick in the Pants."

29:28.868 --> 29:30.336
Reason should be self-evident.
(laughs)

29:30.369 --> 29:34.073
Fancie's was a, uh, beacon
of Southern perfection,

29:34.106 --> 29:36.008
but here you got
great atmosphere

29:36.042 --> 29:39.078
and secret shows with bands
like Needtobreathe.

29:39.111 --> 29:40.847
Wade deserves
all the credit.

29:40.880 --> 29:42.849
He's poured all of
himself into this place.

29:42.882 --> 29:44.083
It's been his dream.

29:44.116 --> 29:45.184
And Fancie's was hers.

29:45.217 --> 29:47.353
She took a good restaurant
and turned it into something

29:47.386 --> 29:49.155
way, way better.

29:49.188 --> 29:50.389
As I'm sure you're aware,

29:50.422 --> 29:53.125
I never do two reviews
in one town.

29:53.159 --> 29:55.427
That's the whole appeal
of my trademark

29:55.461 --> 29:58.197
Walter Wallen Five Fork
Scoring System.

29:58.230 --> 30:02.468
The WWFFSS is an
honorable system.

30:04.303 --> 30:06.973
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

30:07.006 --> 30:09.175
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

30:09.208 --> 30:11.077
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

30:11.110 --> 30:13.846
But there's a first time
for everything.

30:13.880 --> 30:15.447
Are you serious?
Seriously?

30:15.481 --> 30:18.150
If you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go write it up now.

30:18.184 --> 30:20.186
All right.
And it was a pleasure

30:20.219 --> 30:22.254
to meet you both, really.

30:22.288 --> 30:24.156
(kiss)
(gasps)

30:24.190 --> 30:28.060
See? Even as competitors we
still make great partners.

30:28.094 --> 30:29.228
Heck, yeah.
(whoops)

30:29.261 --> 30:31.097
(crowd whoops, applauds)

30:34.100 --> 30:35.935
Oh, maybe we should
stop or something.

30:35.968 --> 30:37.069
Start a fire.

30:37.103 --> 30:38.337
Oh, yeah, sure, a fire.

30:38.370 --> 30:40.039
Let's just
make it super easy

30:40.072 --> 30:41.974
for-for animals
and creepy woods people

30:42.008 --> 30:44.143
to find us.

30:44.176 --> 30:46.145
(sighs)

30:46.178 --> 30:49.215
All I wanted to do was to show
Wade that I cared about him.

30:49.248 --> 30:51.150
But now, not only
do we have no blogger,

30:51.183 --> 30:53.252
we have no wallets, no car,

30:53.285 --> 30:55.154
and we're probably
gonna get eaten by bears.

30:55.187 --> 30:58.190
No, we're not gonna...
Oh. Wait, hey. Hey,

30:58.224 --> 31:01.060
hey! Stop,
please, please.
Please don't be a serial killer.

31:03.262 --> 31:04.230
Hey, is that
Rudy?

31:04.263 --> 31:05.297
Rudy Truitt?

31:05.331 --> 31:06.298
Uh-huh.
Hey.

31:06.332 --> 31:08.968
Never been so happy
to see another human being.

31:09.001 --> 31:10.069
Or a Truitt.
(laughs)

31:10.102 --> 31:12.071
Y'all need a ride or something?
That would be great.

31:12.104 --> 31:13.139
Hop on in.

31:13.172 --> 31:15.474
(whoops)

31:15.507 --> 31:17.009
(chuckling)

31:17.043 --> 31:19.211
Ooh. Lucky running into you.

31:19.245 --> 31:21.380
Yeah. Me, too.

31:21.413 --> 31:23.449
Me and my brothers been
wanting to talk to you.

31:23.482 --> 31:25.384
Looks like tonight's
the night.

31:25.417 --> 31:26.986
Say what now?
Excuse me?

31:36.095 --> 31:39.131
(sighs)
Admit it, Kinsella,
I am a genius.

31:39.165 --> 31:41.367
We had a much better
day off than--

31:41.400 --> 31:44.070
what was his name?
Ferris Bueller?

31:44.103 --> 31:46.138
Exactly. Complete
with taxidermy,

31:46.172 --> 31:49.208
questionable chicken wings,
and a double Five Fork review.

31:49.241 --> 31:52.011
Today was a good day.

31:52.044 --> 31:55.147
But not good enough
to make you forget
about Vivian, huh?

31:55.181 --> 31:56.348
No.

31:56.382 --> 31:58.417
Well... on
to phase two.

31:58.450 --> 32:01.187
Ooh... strip club?
And not a strip club.

32:03.189 --> 32:05.124
ZOE:
Uh, I don't understand.
So you're not

32:05.157 --> 32:06.125
taking us home?

32:06.158 --> 32:07.426
Like, ever?
We will

32:07.459 --> 32:09.028
at some point.

32:09.061 --> 32:11.063
After you face
your punishment.

32:11.097 --> 32:14.233
Okay, what...
what are you talking about?

32:14.266 --> 32:15.734
George Tucker,

32:15.767 --> 32:18.137
we accuse you of breaking
our sister's heart

32:18.170 --> 32:20.472
and driving her to that
cretin, Scooter McGreevy.

32:20.506 --> 32:22.174
And then

32:22.208 --> 32:24.443
allowing her
to run off with him.

32:24.476 --> 32:27.179
Okay, I didn't... I didn't
have a choice. And that...

32:27.213 --> 32:28.047
wasn't...
Shh.

32:28.080 --> 32:30.349
You have the right
to remain silent.

32:30.382 --> 32:33.419
And, Zoe Hart,
we accuse you

32:33.452 --> 32:36.755
of making our muse,
Jo-el Stevens...

32:36.788 --> 32:38.757
leave us forever.

32:38.790 --> 32:42.328
We sentence you
to a punishment of our choosing.

32:42.361 --> 32:44.463
RUDY:
Chicken, you
watch them.

32:44.496 --> 32:48.200
Rocket and I are
gonna go figure out
a suitable punishment.

32:53.239 --> 32:55.707
(quietly):
Seriously...
I'm all scared.

32:55.741 --> 32:57.409
You need to fix this.

32:57.443 --> 32:59.711
Oh, parenting isn't easy,
but I promise you,

32:59.745 --> 33:01.680
in the end, it,
it is worth it.

33:01.713 --> 33:04.450
And you're talking to the
father of Magnolia Breeland.

33:04.483 --> 33:06.352
I'm just so tired.

33:06.385 --> 33:08.354
(laughs):
So, so tired.

33:08.387 --> 33:10.389
I nearly fell asleep
saying that sentence.

33:10.422 --> 33:12.758
Yeah, well, the first
few months can be brutal.

33:12.791 --> 33:14.460
So can the next 18 years.

33:14.493 --> 33:16.295
But I promise you--
the good

33:16.328 --> 33:18.197
outweighs the bad.

33:18.230 --> 33:19.765
Are you sure you don't want
to take me back?

33:19.798 --> 33:22.201
'Cause, boy, it would
be handy to have
someone tell me that.

33:22.234 --> 33:24.236
Plus, you're a doctor
and Ethel gets these rashes.

33:24.270 --> 33:26.072
Shelby...

33:26.105 --> 33:27.206
Right.

33:27.239 --> 33:28.774
Okay.

33:28.807 --> 33:30.476
Mm.

33:30.509 --> 33:31.810
Mm.

33:31.843 --> 33:35.214
Thank you, Brick,
for everything.

33:35.247 --> 33:37.749
Well, let's go get
your little baby back.

33:37.783 --> 33:40.486
No!
What do you mean, no?
She's my baby.

33:40.519 --> 33:41.820
She's just so happy here.

33:41.853 --> 33:44.256
We could work out
an exchange, you know.

33:44.290 --> 33:46.825
I'd keep Ethel; you take
my goat for a little while.

33:46.858 --> 33:48.527
He's so sweet.
You'll love him.

33:48.560 --> 33:51.197
Wanda, we are wasting
valuable time here,

33:51.230 --> 33:53.199
when Shelby could be sleeping.

33:53.232 --> 33:57.169
If you don't mind...

33:59.238 --> 34:01.273
(speaking indistinctly)

34:01.307 --> 34:02.408
(whispers): Ah,

34:02.441 --> 34:04.510
that's right.

34:04.543 --> 34:06.178
Bye, baby.

34:06.212 --> 34:07.679
TOM:
She's awesome.

34:07.713 --> 34:10.382
You're real lucky.
She is.

34:10.416 --> 34:13.152
And, well, maybe I kind
of want one now.

34:13.185 --> 34:15.387
Well, that is good to hear.

34:15.420 --> 34:17.822
I'll see you
in my office tomorrow?

34:20.192 --> 34:23.161
Gerald, Dorrie...
we need to talk.

34:23.195 --> 34:24.530
Oh, that's never good.

34:24.563 --> 34:27.333
Well, no, truth is, I think
you guys are amazing.

34:27.366 --> 34:32.170
But I think it would be best
for all involved if we...

34:32.204 --> 34:33.739
parted ways.

34:33.772 --> 34:36.308
No!
You should have
someone in your life

34:36.342 --> 34:39.311
who doesn't get crazy jealous
and make insane mistakes.

34:39.344 --> 34:41.547
Someone who loves
your daughter the
way she deserves.

34:42.547 --> 34:44.783
You could do better.

34:44.815 --> 34:46.452
Then Lavon Hayes?
No.

34:46.485 --> 34:49.821
Look, give the guy a chance.

34:51.223 --> 34:53.725
It doesn't mean
I won't miss you.

34:53.759 --> 34:55.893
We'll miss you, too, son.

34:55.927 --> 34:57.896
(quietly): Oh...

34:57.929 --> 34:59.298
(sighs)

34:59.331 --> 35:00.832
Well, on the bright side...

35:00.866 --> 35:04.336
at least we can go back
to hating the Tide.

35:05.437 --> 35:08.240
You know, I never
thought I'd say this,

35:08.274 --> 35:12.311
but I'm even gonna miss
that little lizard-
lovin' kid of hers.

35:12.344 --> 35:15.281
Well... you can't
blame yourself.

35:15.314 --> 35:17.449
Oh, I don't blame myself.

35:19.451 --> 35:21.119
And you can't blame Zoe, either.

35:22.954 --> 35:25.891
(sighs)

35:25.924 --> 35:29.428
(exhales) I mean, there's
a lot of things that
you can blame her for,

35:29.461 --> 35:33.299
but... in this instance,
it seems like you put her
in a really terrible position,

35:33.332 --> 35:34.900
and she did her best.

35:34.933 --> 35:37.436
I mean... all she's
really guilty of

35:37.469 --> 35:40.439
is witnessing your heart
get pounded.

35:40.472 --> 35:42.274
Again.

35:42.308 --> 35:44.776
Which probably
reminds you

35:44.810 --> 35:47.413
of how much power she has over
your heart in the first place.

35:51.317 --> 35:53.519
Talk less, drink more.

35:53.552 --> 35:55.554
(laughs)

35:57.556 --> 36:00.859
So, the rabbit goes
around the tree

36:00.892 --> 36:02.394
and back into
his hole.

36:02.428 --> 36:03.229
(chuckles)

36:03.262 --> 36:05.197
Thank you so much.
ROCKET:
Chicken,

36:05.231 --> 36:06.765
what's going on here?

36:06.798 --> 36:07.933
They say they're
entitled

36:07.966 --> 36:11.370
to a fair trial, it's
in the Constitution.

36:11.403 --> 36:13.839
I do love the Constitution.
Well, then you guys

36:13.872 --> 36:15.441
just have yourself
a seat.

36:16.442 --> 36:19.411
(George sighs, clears throat)

36:19.445 --> 36:21.947
Now, gentlemen,
the truth is,

36:21.980 --> 36:23.949
love... well, love...

36:23.982 --> 36:25.784
is a wild beast

36:25.817 --> 36:28.420
that no man or woman
could ever try and control.

36:28.454 --> 36:31.857
The truth here, gentlemen,
is that we are the victims,
we are the ones

36:31.890 --> 36:33.825
that had our hearts
tromped upon and broken.

36:33.859 --> 36:36.562
And you may ask me, well,
who was the guilty one, then?

36:36.595 --> 36:39.365
And I will tell you gentlemen
the guilty one here is love!

36:39.398 --> 36:40.532
Mm-hmm.

36:40.566 --> 36:41.900
Mm.

36:41.933 --> 36:43.535
But that's so sad.

36:43.569 --> 36:45.837
It's not a happy ending at all.

36:45.871 --> 36:48.307
If you can't get
the ones you love back,

36:48.340 --> 36:49.975
wh-what's gonna happen?

36:50.008 --> 36:51.943
Are you gonna die alone?

36:53.379 --> 36:54.780
CHICKEN:
We should keep
them here,

36:54.813 --> 36:55.881
poor things.

36:55.914 --> 36:57.449
We could fix
their broken hearts.

36:57.483 --> 36:59.785
Like those
baby ferrets.

36:59.818 --> 37:00.819
N-No!

37:00.852 --> 37:02.388
No.

37:02.421 --> 37:05.557
Because... you know,
the thing is,

37:05.591 --> 37:08.560
the heart fixes itself.
Mm.

37:08.594 --> 37:11.897
And both of ours...
are already healed.

37:11.930 --> 37:12.864
They are?

37:12.898 --> 37:13.865
Yep.

37:13.899 --> 37:15.534
'Cause now we love each other.

37:15.567 --> 37:16.868
We d...
Mm-hmm.

37:16.902 --> 37:18.003
OTHERS:
Aw...

37:18.036 --> 37:20.272
That's beautiful.

37:20.306 --> 37:21.973
It's like
a movie.

37:22.007 --> 37:24.009
A 3D movie.

37:24.042 --> 37:25.777
You have to stay
and celebrate.

37:25.811 --> 37:28.547
Rocket, Rudy, bring out
the good moonshine!

37:28.580 --> 37:30.048
We'll drink and
then we'll dance!

37:30.081 --> 37:32.551
Rocket, whip us up
some of them

37:32.584 --> 37:34.586
spray-cheese daiquiris.

37:35.987 --> 37:37.989
Run. Run!

37:39.090 --> 37:40.426
Whoo!

37:40.459 --> 37:42.027
Uh...

37:42.060 --> 37:43.362
Rocket?

37:43.395 --> 37:44.396
Rudy?

37:49.801 --> 37:50.969
(Zoe groaning)

37:51.002 --> 37:53.372
I can't feel my legs.

37:53.405 --> 37:55.407
Yeah, my, my lower back
feels like

37:55.441 --> 37:57.776
it's just being punched
repeatedly.

37:57.809 --> 37:59.378
At least we're free.

37:59.411 --> 38:01.913
Yeah. There's that.

38:01.947 --> 38:05.517
We actually made a...
pretty good team back there.

38:05.551 --> 38:06.385
(laughs)

38:06.418 --> 38:09.054
Yeah, and I guess
that we should, uh...

38:09.087 --> 38:10.756
well, talk
about that kiss.

38:10.789 --> 38:12.758
Yeah. Definitely.

38:12.791 --> 38:14.760
It was kind of amazing.

38:14.793 --> 38:17.496
Yeah. I almost forgot
how much I like kissing you.

38:19.398 --> 38:22.934
And here we are, both single.

38:22.968 --> 38:26.938
Both single for the first time
at the same time.

38:26.972 --> 38:28.540
Mm-hmm.
All right, you know

38:28.574 --> 38:31.076
we, we could just...
Yeah. Everything

38:31.109 --> 38:33.945
will be so easy if we just...
Stopped.

38:33.979 --> 38:36.982
If we just...
stopped looking,
if we just stopped

38:37.015 --> 38:39.084
all the shenanigans.

38:39.117 --> 38:42.120
Just...
Easy.

38:42.153 --> 38:43.489
So easy.

38:43.522 --> 38:45.323
But...
But.

38:46.958 --> 38:49.395
...easy isn't really
your thing, is it?

38:51.129 --> 38:52.230
You know,
somewhere along the line,

38:52.263 --> 38:54.966
after I picked you up
on the side of the road, I...

38:55.000 --> 38:56.535
I figured out that easy...

38:56.568 --> 38:59.438
well, easy really isn't
my thing either.

38:59.471 --> 39:01.407
You still glad
you gave me that ride?

39:01.440 --> 39:02.874
Of course I am.
(chuckles)

39:02.908 --> 39:04.843
Because... Zoe Hart...

39:04.876 --> 39:07.045
that day I found
a very good friend.

39:07.078 --> 39:10.115
(mock gasp)
Me?
You.

39:10.148 --> 39:13.485
And I hope it stays that way
 for a very long time.

39:13.519 --> 39:16.922
Now, I have to ask you,
Zoe Hart, friend to friend...
Mm-hmm, what's that?

39:16.955 --> 39:19.591
...are you sure you
did everything you
did for Wade today

39:19.625 --> 39:22.394
just to show him what
a good friend you are? Huh?
Yes.

39:22.428 --> 39:23.328
Why are you asking?

39:23.361 --> 39:26.064
That's why you did it
for Lemon, right?

39:26.097 --> 39:27.599
Yes, absolutely.

39:27.633 --> 39:29.100
Yeah.
(chuckles)

39:29.134 --> 39:31.169
*

39:31.202 --> 39:33.138
I-I guess my favorite
of your Alaska pictures

39:33.171 --> 39:35.974
were the orcas--
I'd kill to see
them in the wild.

39:36.007 --> 39:38.043
So, you like whales, Davis?

39:38.076 --> 39:40.111
Yeah. I minored
in marine biology.

39:40.145 --> 39:42.180
I love them.
Uh, not more

39:42.213 --> 39:44.015
than I love
your daughter, though.

39:44.049 --> 39:45.183
GERALD:
Ah, oh-ho...

39:45.216 --> 39:48.186
Uh, son, tell
me more about

39:48.219 --> 39:51.089
this, uh, DIY podcast.
'Cause, you know, if there's

39:51.122 --> 39:53.058
one thing I hate,
it's people who expect

39:53.091 --> 39:55.561
everyone else to
do things for 'em.
Do you think

39:55.594 --> 39:59.965
we could figure out
how to subscribe to that?
DAVIS: Ooh, maybe

39:59.998 --> 40:02.000
I should do a podcast
on how you can subscribe

40:02.033 --> 40:03.134
to a podcast.

40:03.168 --> 40:04.169
(laughter)

40:04.202 --> 40:05.871
Stop it.

40:08.073 --> 40:10.075
*

40:17.616 --> 40:18.984
Hello, George.
(yells)

40:19.017 --> 40:21.587
Geez, Lemon!
Let me guess:

40:21.620 --> 40:23.054
walk of shame?

40:23.088 --> 40:25.891
I am so not in the mood.

40:25.924 --> 40:28.093
Well, guess what,
I'm not here to argue.

40:28.126 --> 40:29.595
Because while you
were out gallivanting,

40:29.628 --> 40:31.597
doing God knows what
with God knows who,

40:31.630 --> 40:33.532
I managed
to fix Fancie's woes

40:33.565 --> 40:36.234
all by myself.

40:36.267 --> 40:40.105
Walter Wallen
reviewed Fancie's?

40:40.138 --> 40:42.207
LEMON:
Yes. No thanks to you.

40:42.240 --> 40:45.176
Once again, I was left
to clean up your mess.
I just wish that you

40:45.210 --> 40:48.013
cared one iota about this
business, and maybe we'd
actually get somewhere.

40:48.046 --> 40:49.214
You know what I'm saying?
Out!

40:50.549 --> 40:52.083
Out of my houseboat!

40:52.117 --> 40:53.819
What has gotten into you?

40:53.852 --> 40:56.087
You got three stairs there.
Watch your step.

40:56.121 --> 40:58.490
Good night!

40:58.524 --> 41:00.058
(sighs)

41:03.862 --> 41:05.864
*

41:08.133 --> 41:10.135
(whistling)

41:13.805 --> 41:15.073
(grunts)
Oh!

41:15.106 --> 41:16.575
Damn it!

41:16.608 --> 41:18.143
Unbe... Hey!
There you are.

41:18.176 --> 41:20.111
I damn near broke my leg
on that thing.

41:20.145 --> 41:22.113
I thought you said you
were gonna fix that hole.

41:22.147 --> 41:24.115
Yeah, well, I was busy.

41:24.149 --> 41:25.283
Yeah, of course you were.

41:25.316 --> 41:26.852
Are you serious?

41:26.885 --> 41:29.054
Do you have any idea what
I have just been through?

41:29.087 --> 41:30.956
What's stuck in your craw?

41:30.989 --> 41:32.891
That's it. I'm done.

41:32.924 --> 41:34.225
I un-apologize.

41:34.259 --> 41:36.595
I don't even want
to be your friend anyway!

41:36.628 --> 41:37.963
Hey. Whoa.

41:37.996 --> 41:39.197
You know what?
You want help

41:39.230 --> 41:40.999
with that hole?
Here's a tip:

41:41.032 --> 41:43.101
it's always
in the same place.

41:43.134 --> 41:45.837
It's not moving around,
trying to trick you.

41:45.871 --> 41:48.006
So why don't you just
watch where you're going?!

41:48.039 --> 41:50.876
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to go pass out.

41:50.909 --> 41:54.012
Hey, if you want to, I can teach
you how to do it, all right?

41:54.045 --> 41:56.815
It's real easy-- you
just take dirt from
one part of the ground

41:56.848 --> 41:59.084
and you move it to another.
Ignorance is nothing

41:59.117 --> 42:00.552
to be afraid of, Zoe Hart. Aah!

42:00.586 --> 42:03.589
ZOE:
Idiot!
