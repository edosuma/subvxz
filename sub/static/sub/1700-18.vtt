00:15.432 --> 00:17.433
Rach, we're running low
on résumés over here.

00:18.101 --> 00:20.436
Do you really want a job
with Popular Mechanics?

00:20.603 --> 00:23.897
Well, if you're gonna work for mechanics,
those are the ones to work for.

00:25.108 --> 00:27.484
Hey, look, you guys.
I'm going for anything here, okay?

00:27.652 --> 00:29.695
I can't be a waitress anymore. I mean it.

00:29.863 --> 00:33.574
I'm sick of the lousy tips.
I'm sick of being called "Excuse Me."

00:35.326 --> 00:37.578
Rach, did you proofread these?

00:37.787 --> 00:39.580
Uh, yeah. Why?

00:39.748 --> 00:45.419
Uh, nothing. I'm sure they'll be impressed
with your excellent "compuper" skills.

00:45.587 --> 00:48.005
Oh, my God!

00:48.173 --> 00:50.716
Oh, do you think it's on all of them?

00:53.970 --> 00:57.347
Oh, no, I'm sure the Xerox machine
caught a few.

01:48.817 --> 01:50.651
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

01:50.819 --> 01:53.278
Hey. Hi, ladies.

01:53.446 --> 01:55.948
Uh, can I get you anything?

01:56.116 --> 01:58.033
- Did you bring the mail?
- Lots of responses.

01:58.201 --> 02:01.120
Really? Sure we have scones left.

02:02.038 --> 02:03.080
Okay, read them to me.

02:03.248 --> 02:07.835
"Dear Miss Green: Thank you
for your inquiry. However..."

02:08.627 --> 02:11.088
- We have apple cinnamon...
- Okay, "Dear Miss Green"...

02:11.256 --> 02:14.424
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. No.

02:16.594 --> 02:17.636
- Wow.
- What?

02:17.804 --> 02:20.222
Your Visa bill is huge.

02:21.099 --> 02:22.141
Give me that.

02:22.517 --> 02:24.434
You know, I can't believe you.
Linda is so great.

02:24.602 --> 02:26.645
- Why won't you go out with her again?
- I don't know.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.564
Is this still about her whole...

02:28.731 --> 02:31.233
..."The Flintstones could
have really happened" thing?

02:32.527 --> 02:33.694
It's not just that.

02:33.862 --> 02:36.697
It's just, I want someone
who does something for me...

02:36.865 --> 02:38.782
...you know,
who gets my heart pounding...

02:39.742 --> 02:41.869
...who makes me, uh...

02:43.663 --> 02:46.039
Little play things with yarn?

02:47.667 --> 02:49.001
What?

02:49.210 --> 02:51.712
Could you want her more?

02:52.338 --> 02:53.338
Who?

02:53.506 --> 02:57.050
Who? Dee, the sarcastic sister
from What's Happening!!

03:00.138 --> 03:01.555
Who?

03:04.601 --> 03:07.186
Look, I am totally, totally over her, okay?

03:07.353 --> 03:08.937
- I just... Hi.
- Hi. Coffee?

03:09.105 --> 03:11.481
- No, we're fine.
- Okay.

03:16.863 --> 03:17.905
Shut up.

03:18.072 --> 03:19.948
We're not saying anything.

03:20.116 --> 03:22.701
- What?
- Uh, Joey cried last night.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.662
Thank you.

03:26.122 --> 03:27.414
We were playing poker, right?

03:27.582 --> 03:30.542
There was chocolate on the three.
It looked like an eight, all right?

03:31.586 --> 03:35.547
Oh, God, you should've seen him.
"Read them and weep."

03:35.715 --> 03:37.633
And then he did.

03:38.885 --> 03:42.554
Well, now, how come you guys
have never played poker with us?

03:42.722 --> 03:44.848
Yeah, what is that?
Like some kind of guy thing?

03:45.016 --> 03:46.892
Like some kind of sexist guy thing?

03:47.101 --> 03:49.394
Like, it's poker, so only guys can play?

03:49.771 --> 03:51.230
No. Women are welcome to play.

03:51.397 --> 03:52.731
Oh, okay, so then what is it?

03:52.899 --> 03:56.193
Some kind of, you know, like,
some kind of, you know, like...

03:56.361 --> 03:58.195
All right, what is it?

03:59.822 --> 04:02.032
There just don't happen
to be any women in our game.

04:02.200 --> 04:06.078
Yeah, we just don't happen to know any
women that know how to play poker.

04:06.246 --> 04:10.249
Oh, please. That is such a lame excuse.
I mean, it's a typical guy response.

04:10.416 --> 04:12.376
Excuse me, do any of you
know how to play?

04:12.543 --> 04:14.044
No.

04:15.421 --> 04:16.755
But you could teach us.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.423
No.

04:23.054 --> 04:27.557
Okay, so now we draw cards.

04:30.561 --> 04:33.021
So I wouldn't need any, right?
Because I have a straight.

04:33.189 --> 04:35.482
- Oh, good for you.
- Congratulations.

04:38.611 --> 04:40.445
Okay, Pheebs, how many do you want?

04:40.697 --> 04:45.701
Okay, I just need two.
The 10 of spades and the six of clubs.

04:47.453 --> 04:49.079
No, uh, Pheebs, you can't do that.

04:49.247 --> 04:51.123
I have the 10 of spades.
Here, you want it?

04:51.291 --> 04:52.666
Thanks.

04:53.835 --> 04:56.378
Uh, no, see, uh, you can't do that.

04:56.546 --> 04:58.922
No, no. That's okay. I don't need them.
I'm going for fours.

04:59.090 --> 05:00.465
Oh, you're...

05:06.139 --> 05:07.264
All right, here we go.

05:07.432 --> 05:10.684
We've got salmon roulettes
and assorted crudités.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.644
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Monica, what are you doing?

05:12.812 --> 05:16.648
This is a poker game. You can't serve food
with more than one syllable.

05:16.816 --> 05:20.277
It's got to be like chips
or dip or pretz...

05:22.822 --> 05:24.323
Okay, so at this point, the dealer...

05:24.490 --> 05:28.160
You know what? We got it. We got it.
Let's play for real. High stakes. Big bucks.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.704
All right, now, you sure?
Phoebe just threw away two jacks...

05:30.872 --> 05:32.581
...because they didn't look happy.

05:36.794 --> 05:39.963
But I'm ready. So just deal.

05:40.131 --> 05:43.091
Okay, all right, last minute lesson.
Last minute lesson. Joey.

05:43.468 --> 05:44.760
Three...

05:44.927 --> 05:46.428
...eight.

05:46.596 --> 05:48.597
Eight, three. All right. Here we go.

05:53.686 --> 05:55.771
Damn it, damn it, damn it.

05:55.938 --> 05:58.565
I see. So then, um, you were lying.

05:58.733 --> 06:01.026
- About what?
- About how good your cards were.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.944
Heh. I was bluffing.

06:03.196 --> 06:06.198
Aha. And what is "bluffing"?

06:07.950 --> 06:11.161
Is it not another word for lying?

06:11.704 --> 06:13.663
Okay, sorry to break up this party...

06:13.831 --> 06:16.041
...but I've got résumés to fax
before work tomorrow.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.502
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Rach, we've got to settle.

06:18.669 --> 06:20.420
Settle what?

06:21.089 --> 06:23.590
The Jamestown colony of Virginia.

06:25.468 --> 06:28.553
You see, King George
is giving us the land, so...

06:31.307 --> 06:34.476
The game, Rachel. The game.
You owe us money for the game.

06:34.644 --> 06:35.727
Oh, right.

06:35.895 --> 06:39.356
You know what, guys? It's their first time.
Why don't we forget about the money?

06:39.524 --> 06:42.150
Hell, no. We'll pay.

06:42.318 --> 06:45.570
Okay, Monica,
I had another answer all ready.

06:47.031 --> 06:48.198
And you know what?

06:48.366 --> 06:51.034
- We want a rematch.
- Well, that's fine with me.

06:51.202 --> 06:53.245
Could use the money.

06:54.205 --> 06:58.458
So, basically, you get your ya-yas
by taking money from all of your friends.

06:59.377 --> 07:02.796
- Yeah.
- Yes, and I get my ya-yas from lkea.

07:04.882 --> 07:08.510
You have to put them together yourself,
but they cost a little less.

07:09.554 --> 07:12.597
Look, Rachel, this is poker.
I play to win, all right?

07:12.765 --> 07:15.100
In order for me to win,
other people have to lose.

07:15.268 --> 07:18.854
So if you're gonna play poker with me,
don't expect me to be a nice guy.

07:19.021 --> 07:22.023
Okay, because once those cards
are dealt...

07:31.284 --> 07:32.617
Yeah?

07:35.955 --> 07:38.081
I'm not a nice guy.

07:44.881 --> 07:46.506
All right, boys. Let's eat.

07:46.674 --> 07:50.302
Ah, did you get that from
the "I Love Rachel" pizzeria?

07:51.012 --> 07:52.512
- You still on that?
- Come on.

07:52.680 --> 07:54.848
What was with that whole
Black Bart speech?

07:55.016 --> 07:58.435
"When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy".

07:59.228 --> 08:00.604
You're way off, pal.

08:00.771 --> 08:04.441
No, I don't think so.
See, Ross, because I think you love her.

08:05.151 --> 08:06.318
Uh, no.

08:06.486 --> 08:09.821
See, I might have had feelings for her
at one time. Not anymore.

08:09.989 --> 08:12.699
I just... Marcel.

08:12.867 --> 08:16.244
Where are you going with that disk?
You are not putting that on again.

08:16.412 --> 08:21.541
Marcel... Okay. If you press that button,
you are in very, very big trouble.

08:35.681 --> 08:38.433
You believe what a jerk Ross was being?

08:38.601 --> 08:41.019
Yeah, I know.
He can get really competitive.

08:44.565 --> 08:45.815
What?

08:45.983 --> 08:49.694
Oh. "Hello, Kettle, this is Monica.
You're black."

08:49.946 --> 08:51.655
Please.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.660
I am not as bad as Ross.

08:56.827 --> 09:00.288
Oh, I beg to differ.
The Pictionary incident?

09:00.998 --> 09:02.499
That was not an incident.

09:02.667 --> 09:07.254
I was gesturing and the plate
slipped out of my hand.

09:07.421 --> 09:08.755
Oh.

09:10.174 --> 09:14.636
- Oh! I got an interview. I got an interview.
- You're kidding. Where? Where?

09:14.804 --> 09:19.391
- Saks Fifth Avenue.
- Oh, Rachel.

09:19.642 --> 09:23.061
Oh, it's like the mother ship
is calling you home.

09:26.941 --> 09:30.110
- Well, what's the job?
- Assistant buyer.

09:30.278 --> 09:33.822
Oh! I would be shopping...

09:34.949 --> 09:36.908
...for a living.

09:38.953 --> 09:40.328
Okay, look. That's Aunt Iris.

09:40.496 --> 09:42.831
This woman has been playing poker
since she was 5.

09:42.999 --> 09:45.333
You've gotta listen
to every word she says.

09:45.501 --> 09:47.711
- Hi.
- Is Tony Randall dead?

09:48.004 --> 09:49.296
- Oh, why?
- I don't think so.

09:49.463 --> 09:52.507
Well, he may be now
because I think I hit him with my car.

09:52.717 --> 09:55.760
- My God. Really?
- No, that's bluffing. Lesson number one.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.639
Let me tell you something.

09:59.807 --> 10:03.393
Everything you hear
at a poker game is pure crap.

10:03.936 --> 10:05.937
- Nice earrings.
- Thank you.

10:08.733 --> 10:10.567
Girls, sit down.

10:10.735 --> 10:13.570
- Um, Aunt Iris, this is Phoebe, and Rachel...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:13.738 --> 10:16.781
Listen, I am parked at a meter.
Let's do it.

10:26.167 --> 10:29.586
Ross, could we please, please,
listen to anything else?

10:29.754 --> 10:31.212
All right.

10:47.563 --> 10:49.773
I'm gonna pay for that tonight.

10:54.945 --> 10:56.029
- Hi.
- Hey.

10:56.197 --> 10:57.656
Guess what, guess what, guess what.

10:57.823 --> 11:02.744
Uh, okay. The fifth dentist caved,
and now they're all recommending Trident?

11:08.751 --> 11:11.127
No, the interview.

11:11.295 --> 11:13.213
She loved me. She absolutely loved me.

11:13.381 --> 11:17.092
We talked for, like, two and a half hours.
We have the same taste in clothes.

11:17.385 --> 11:19.344
Oh, I went to camp with her cousin.

11:19.512 --> 11:23.056
And, oh, the job is perfect.
I can do this. I can do this well.

11:23.224 --> 11:24.599
That's great.

11:24.767 --> 11:26.559
God. And she told the funniest story.

11:26.727 --> 11:28.687
Okay, great,
you'll tell us and we'll laugh.

11:28.854 --> 11:30.772
Let's play poker.

11:32.441 --> 11:34.234
All right, listen, we talked about it...

11:34.402 --> 11:36.945
...and if you don't want to play,
we completely understand.

11:37.113 --> 11:40.198
Yes, yes. We can play some other game.
Like, I don't know...

11:40.366 --> 11:41.991
...Pictionary?

11:43.869 --> 11:45.161
Very funny. Very funny.

11:45.329 --> 11:47.789
I think we'd like to give poker another try.
Shall we, ladies?

11:47.957 --> 11:49.457
Yes, I think we should.

11:49.625 --> 11:51.209
Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?

11:51.377 --> 11:54.003
No, no. That's okay. You know what?
I'm gonna give it a go.

11:54.171 --> 11:55.380
- All right.
- All right.

12:06.600 --> 12:09.561
So Pheebs owes 7.50.
Monica, you owe $10.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.731
And, Rachel, you owe 15 big ones.

12:13.941 --> 12:15.692
Thanks for teaching us
"Crossed-eyed Mary."

12:15.860 --> 12:18.194
You guys, we gotta play that other way.

12:19.739 --> 12:23.658
All right, here's my 7.50, but I think
you should know that this money is cursed.

12:23.826 --> 12:26.286
- What?
- Oh, I cursed it.

12:27.997 --> 12:30.707
So now bad things will happen
to he who spends it.

12:31.459 --> 12:34.586
That's all right, I'll take it.
Bad things happen to me anyway.

12:35.671 --> 12:38.214
This way, I can break them up
with a movie.

12:38.382 --> 12:43.762
So that just leaves the big
Green poker machine, who owes 15.

12:43.971 --> 12:46.139
Hmm, oh, it's so typical:

12:46.307 --> 12:48.767
"Ooh, I'm a man. Ooh, I have a penis.

12:48.934 --> 12:52.812
Ooh, I have to win money
to exert my power over women."

12:56.358 --> 12:57.859
You know what? This is not over.

12:58.194 --> 13:01.279
We will play you again.
And we will win and you will lose.

13:01.447 --> 13:03.198
And you will beg and we will laugh.

13:03.365 --> 13:05.200
And we will take
every last dime you have.

13:05.367 --> 13:08.244
And you will hate yourselves forever.

13:09.830 --> 13:13.333
Hmm. Kind of stepped on
my point there, Mon.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.549
So you gals wanna hand over
your money now?

13:21.717 --> 13:24.844
That way, we don't have to go
through the formality of actually playing.

13:25.721 --> 13:29.974
No, that's fine. We'll see
who has the last laugh there, monkey boy.

13:32.895 --> 13:36.022
Okay, are we done with the chitchat?
Are we ready to play serious poker?

13:36.232 --> 13:39.943
Hey, you guys, look. The one-eyed jack
follows me wherever I go.

13:41.570 --> 13:43.488
Right, okay. Serious poker.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.908
Excuse me. Where are you going?

13:47.076 --> 13:48.409
Uh, to the bathroom.

13:48.577 --> 13:50.954
Do you wanna go to the bathroom
or do you wanna play poker?

13:51.121 --> 13:52.789
I wanna go to the bathroom.

13:55.125 --> 13:57.794
- All right, well, I'm gonna order a pizza.
- Oh, no, no, no.

13:57.962 --> 13:59.379
I'm waiting to hear from that job.

13:59.547 --> 14:02.131
And the store closes at 9,
so you can eat then.

14:02.967 --> 14:06.970
That's fine. I'll just have a Tic Tac
to hold me over.

14:07.930 --> 14:12.308
All right. Cincinnati. No blinds.
Everybody ante.

14:12.726 --> 14:14.310
Yes.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.521
Or no.

14:18.482 --> 14:19.941
All right.

14:20.109 --> 14:21.734
Your money's mine, Green.

14:21.902 --> 14:23.611
Your fly's open, Geller.

14:29.618 --> 14:31.286
You guys, you know what I just realized?

14:32.371 --> 14:35.456
"Joker" is "poker" with a "J."

14:37.835 --> 14:39.419
Coincidence?

14:40.713 --> 14:44.591
Hey, that's "jo-incidence" with a "C."

14:55.019 --> 14:58.605
- Uh, Phoebe. Phoebe...
- Yeah, I'm out.

14:59.356 --> 15:00.648
I'm in.

15:00.816 --> 15:02.025
Me too.

15:02.192 --> 15:03.985
Me too. All right. What do you got?

15:04.904 --> 15:09.407
Well, you better hop out of the shower,
because I got a flush.

15:12.328 --> 15:14.078
Well, well, well.

15:14.246 --> 15:18.917
Hop back in, bucko,
because I got four sixes.

15:19.084 --> 15:22.128
I got four sixes. I won. I actually won.

15:22.463 --> 15:26.549
Oh, my God. You know what?
I think I'm gonna make a little Ross pile.

15:28.135 --> 15:33.014
I think that one was Ross'.
And I think, oh, that one was Ross'.

15:34.475 --> 15:38.311
Well, I have got your money.
And you'll never see it.

15:38.479 --> 15:40.730
And your fly's still open.

15:41.065 --> 15:42.982
I made you look.

15:45.903 --> 15:48.446
- I'm in.
- I couldn't be inner.

15:48.614 --> 15:51.407
Monica? Monica, in or out?

15:51.617 --> 15:53.534
I hate this game.

16:01.627 --> 16:03.044
Okay, Joey, your bet.

16:03.462 --> 16:06.464
I fold, like a cheap hooker
who got hit in the stomach...

16:06.632 --> 16:09.509
...by a fat guy with sores on his face.

16:13.305 --> 16:14.472
Oh, I'm out.

16:15.766 --> 16:18.977
- Ross?
- Oh, I'm very in.

16:19.853 --> 16:22.021
- Chandler?
- Couldn't be more out.

16:22.189 --> 16:24.649
Me too. Rachel?

16:24.817 --> 16:29.404
Um, I will see you and I'll raise you.

16:29.571 --> 16:31.489
What do you say?
You wanna waste another buck?

16:32.491 --> 16:34.158
No, not this time.

16:34.326 --> 16:36.494
- So, what did you have?
- I'm not telling.

16:36.662 --> 16:37.829
- Come on, show them to me.
- No.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.498
- Show them to me. Let me see.
- Get your hands out of there.

16:40.666 --> 16:42.417
You know, I've had dates like this.

16:45.170 --> 16:48.256
Boy, you really can't stand to lose,
can you?

16:48.424 --> 16:49.924
Your whole face is getting red.

16:50.092 --> 16:53.678
Little veins popping out of your temple.

16:53.971 --> 16:57.265
Plus that shirt doesn't really
match those pants.

17:01.186 --> 17:02.353
First of all, I'm not losing.

17:04.356 --> 17:05.647
- Just deal.
- Hello? Rachel Green.

17:08.444 --> 17:09.694
Excuse me.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.445
It's about the job.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.615
Barbara, hi. How are you?

17:16.743 --> 17:18.118
Uh-huh?

17:19.079 --> 17:20.413
No, I understand.

17:21.582 --> 17:26.419
Yeah, oh, come on. No, I'm fine.
Don't be silly.

17:26.712 --> 17:30.965
Yeah. Oh, but you know,
if anything else opens up, please...

17:31.133 --> 17:35.386
Hello?

17:43.937 --> 17:45.188
Hmm.

17:51.028 --> 17:52.236
Sorry, Rach.

17:52.404 --> 17:54.614
Yeah, you know,
there's gonna be lots of other stuff.

17:54.782 --> 17:57.450
Yeah. Okay.

17:58.368 --> 18:00.828
Where were we? Oh. Okay.

18:00.996 --> 18:05.249
Five card draw. Uh, jacks are better.

18:05.417 --> 18:06.793
Nothing wild, everybody ante.

18:07.461 --> 18:09.754
Look, Rach, we don't have to do this.

18:10.589 --> 18:12.090
Yes, we do.

18:14.802 --> 18:16.803
- All right. Check.
- Check.

18:17.304 --> 18:18.554
I'm in for 50 cents.

18:19.348 --> 18:21.974
- Call.
- I'm in.

18:22.601 --> 18:25.228
I see your 50 cents...

18:25.395 --> 18:27.522
...and I raise you...

18:28.148 --> 18:29.607
...$5.

18:29.775 --> 18:32.193
I thought, uh, it was a 50-cent limit.

18:32.361 --> 18:35.446
Well, I just lost a job,
and I'd like to raise the bet 5 bucks.

18:35.614 --> 18:37.698
Does anybody have a problem with that?

18:38.659 --> 18:40.576
- Not at all.
- No, no.

18:44.915 --> 18:46.249
Loser?

18:54.258 --> 18:55.341
No, I fold.

18:55.717 --> 18:58.219
What do you mean, you fold?
Hey, come on, what is this?

18:58.387 --> 19:02.807
I thought that, "Once the cards
are dealt, I'm not a nice guy."

19:02.975 --> 19:04.517
I mean, what? Were you just full of it?

19:18.824 --> 19:19.824
I'm in.

19:20.742 --> 19:22.827
- How many you want?
- One.

19:24.413 --> 19:26.247
Dealer takes two.

19:26.748 --> 19:29.542
- What do you bet?
- I bet $2.

19:30.878 --> 19:31.878
Okay.

19:32.045 --> 19:33.796
See your 2...

19:34.339 --> 19:36.465
...and I raise you...

19:38.218 --> 19:40.261
...20.
- Wow.

19:44.892 --> 19:46.350
I see your 20...

19:47.769 --> 19:49.353
...raise you 25.

19:55.277 --> 19:57.361
See your 25...

19:57.696 --> 19:59.363
...and, uh, Monica, get my purse.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.579
Rachel, there's nothing in it.

20:08.957 --> 20:11.250
Okay, then get me your purse.

20:14.963 --> 20:17.882
Okay. Here you go. Good luck.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.175
Thank you.

20:19.676 --> 20:23.304
I saw your 25 and I raise you...

20:23.847 --> 20:25.556
...7.

20:26.475 --> 20:27.725
- Teen.

20:35.984 --> 20:38.027
Joey, I'm a little shy.

20:38.904 --> 20:41.530
That's okay, Ross. You can ask me.

20:48.038 --> 20:49.914
- What do you need? What do you need?
- Fifteen.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.166
- All right, here's 10.
- Here, I got 5, I got 5.

20:52.334 --> 20:53.709
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

20:55.295 --> 20:58.047
Okay, I am calling your 17.

20:58.215 --> 20:59.840
What do you got?

21:10.811 --> 21:12.186
Full house.

21:21.071 --> 21:22.154
You got me.

21:22.322 --> 21:23.406
Oh!

21:33.500 --> 21:36.294
- That's a tough hand to beat.
- I thought we had them.

21:36.461 --> 21:39.422
Well, when you don't have the cards,
you don't have the cards, you know?

21:40.257 --> 21:41.841
But look how happy she is.

21:53.603 --> 21:55.313
- Airmail.
- Airplane. Airport.

21:55.480 --> 21:59.400
Airport '75. Airport '77. Airport '79.

22:01.069 --> 22:02.153
Time's up.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.739
Bye Bye Birdie.

22:06.533 --> 22:08.659
That's a bird?

22:08.827 --> 22:10.411
That's a bird.

22:11.872 --> 22:13.789
Okay, okay, it's my turn.

22:15.876 --> 22:17.376
Go.

22:18.879 --> 22:21.839
Uh, Bean. Bean.

22:23.425 --> 22:25.843
- The Unbearable Lightness of Being.
- Yes!

22:29.181 --> 22:33.184
That you get?
