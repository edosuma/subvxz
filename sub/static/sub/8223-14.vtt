00:24.051 --> 00:26.004
When the poop hits the fan...

00:26.005 --> 00:29.767
Adam's now gonna build a rig
that consistently throws poo.

00:30.077 --> 00:33.218
...Does everyone in the
room really get covered?

00:33.219 --> 00:34.456
Oh, hold on a sec.

00:34.721 --> 00:37.154
Then, to find out
if getting cold feet

00:37.155 --> 00:39.589
means you actually
get cold feet...

00:39.590 --> 00:40.396
Ah.

00:40.397 --> 00:42.365
...Arachnophobe Grant...

00:43.156 --> 00:44.743
...Acrophobe Tory...

00:44.744 --> 00:46.580
That was terrifying.

00:46.581 --> 00:49.105
...And squeamish queen Kari

00:49.491 --> 00:52.795
bare their soles and
face their phobias.

00:52.796 --> 00:54.615
Science tastes like vomit.

00:57.185 --> 00:58.924
Who are the Mythbusters?

00:58.925 --> 01:00.173
Adam savage...

01:00.174 --> 01:01.683
It's scientific.

01:01.684 --> 01:03.311
...And Jamie Hyneman.

01:03.312 --> 01:05.196
I call it my little pop gun.

01:05.197 --> 01:09.433
Between them, more than 30 years
of special-effects experience.

01:09.925 --> 01:12.225
Joining them... Kari Byron...

01:12.226 --> 01:14.587
Explosives and electricity. Whoo!

01:14.746 --> 01:15.941
...Tory belleci...

01:15.942 --> 01:18.192
We're popping popcorn with lasers.

01:18.193 --> 01:19.342
...And Grant Imahara.

01:19.343 --> 01:20.535
I'm free! Aah!

01:20.536 --> 01:22.667
They don't just tell the myths.

01:22.691 --> 01:25.353
They put them to the test.

01:38.586 --> 01:40.389
"A watched pot never boils."

01:40.390 --> 01:43.496
"A stitch in time saves nine."
What are you doing?

01:43.497 --> 01:45.279
We're doing another idiom special,

01:45.280 --> 01:46.786
and I'm going through
fan submissions.

01:46.787 --> 01:47.847
What's next?

01:48.185 --> 01:50.195
"Cat has nine lives."

01:50.196 --> 01:51.347
Can we do that one?

01:51.348 --> 01:53.490
No, we cannot!

01:54.177 --> 01:55.866
"Wild goose chase."

01:55.867 --> 01:58.701
Can we eat the goose? No.
That one's out.

02:00.138 --> 02:01.926
We're never gonna get a
chance to do this one.

02:02.188 --> 02:04.301
"When the poop hits the fan."

02:04.888 --> 02:06.178
I think we can do that one.

02:06.179 --> 02:08.065
Really? What's the myth?

02:08.066 --> 02:10.116
Well, it's a worst-case scenario.

02:10.118 --> 02:12.149
It means that when the
poop hits the fan,

02:12.150 --> 02:14.704
crap's going everywhere,
and if you're anywhere in the vicinity,

02:14.705 --> 02:15.752
you're gonna get covered in it.

02:15.753 --> 02:18.852
And you think we can
do this tastefully?

02:18.853 --> 02:22.728
Well, maybe not tastefully,
but scientifically.

02:23.127 --> 02:24.003
Okay.

02:25.665 --> 02:26.997
So, the team are asking,

02:26.998 --> 02:30.411
when unexpected,
all-encompassing chaos ensues,

02:30.412 --> 02:33.630
does this idiomatic
allusion really hold true?

02:33.631 --> 02:36.828
If you actually flung
feces into a fan,

02:36.829 --> 02:38.833
would everyone in the vicinity

02:38.834 --> 02:41.542
end up covered in sh... shrapnel?

02:42.179 --> 02:43.792
This story's about poo.

02:46.198 --> 02:48.835
And in fact, it's about
poo flying everywhere.

02:51.097 --> 02:53.505
Obviously we don't want to
be exposed to this stuff,

02:53.506 --> 02:54.604
so with that in mind,

02:54.605 --> 02:57.656
we're gonna create our own
user-friendly version,

02:57.657 --> 02:59.991
which will be hygienic
and won't smell bad...

02:59.992 --> 03:03.035
Waiter, my poo has a hair in it.

03:03.036 --> 03:06.404
...Yet retains all its other
physical characteristics.

03:06.405 --> 03:09.690
Now, to do that,
we need to use some real poo,

03:09.691 --> 03:12.816
look really closely at it,
measure its qualities,

03:12.817 --> 03:14.795
and then try to replicate them.

03:14.796 --> 03:17.753
We've decided to use dog
poo for that purpose

03:17.754 --> 03:19.516
because it's readily available

03:19.792 --> 03:21.356
and it's what you might call

03:21.357 --> 03:24.178
your average,
middle-of-the-road excrement.

03:24.179 --> 03:27.539
Basically, they're opening up a
whole new field of science...

03:27.540 --> 03:30.230
uh, excrement metrics?

03:30.891 --> 03:32.665
Excrement metrics.

03:32.666 --> 03:34.003
We have come up with three metrics

03:34.004 --> 03:35.826
by which we are gonna
make our imitation poo.

03:35.827 --> 03:36.921
The first one... density.

03:36.922 --> 03:40.293
We found that 100 cubic
centimeters of real poo

03:40.294 --> 03:41.840
weighed 4.1 ounces.

03:41.841 --> 03:43.570
That's the weight
we're gonna shoot for.

03:43.571 --> 03:46.826
The next property I was
thinking of was compressibility.

03:46.827 --> 03:47.857
Second... compressibility.

03:47.858 --> 03:49.771
A two-inch-diameter puck,

03:49.772 --> 03:51.855
when we put a couple of
pounds of weight on it,

03:51.856 --> 03:54.663
actually compressed to a
four-inch-diameter puck.

03:54.664 --> 03:56.411
We're gonna look for the
same type of behavior

03:56.412 --> 03:57.774
from our imitation.

03:57.984 --> 03:59.783
What about stickiness?

03:59.784 --> 04:02.745
Third and final
metric is stickiness.

04:02.746 --> 04:04.601
We found that when our
puck was compressed

04:04.602 --> 04:05.957
between two sheets of acrylic,

04:05.958 --> 04:07.770
if we put a little weight
on the bottom sheet,

04:07.771 --> 04:11.091
it took four seconds to
unstick from the poo.

04:11.092 --> 04:12.867
We're gonna look for that
exact kind of behavior,

04:12.868 --> 04:15.807
and we feel, if we match
all three of these metrics,

04:15.808 --> 04:18.966
our imitation poo is gonna
be just like the real thing,

04:18.966 --> 04:20.911
with none of the downsides.

04:21.099 --> 04:22.835
Now that we know what
we have to replicate,

04:22.836 --> 04:24.819
it's time to make
our poo analogue.

04:24.820 --> 04:27.502
And strangely enough,
Jamie being Jamie,

04:27.503 --> 04:30.408
it's a skill he's
spent years refining.

04:30.409 --> 04:31.334
Flour.

04:31.646 --> 04:33.174
I actually have a
lot of experience

04:33.175 --> 04:34.928
doing something
rather like this...

04:34.929 --> 04:37.912
Cornmeal....Not making poop...

04:37.913 --> 04:38.852
Water.

04:39.043 --> 04:43.227
...But actually making
fake organic products,

04:43.228 --> 04:45.656
in particular food
products for commercials.

04:45.657 --> 04:46.777
Clay powder.

04:47.213 --> 04:49.851
I've made oversized cookies...

04:49.852 --> 04:50.638
Oil.

04:50.639 --> 04:53.066
...Every kind of a food
product you can imagine,

04:53.067 --> 04:57.613
and I find that you can create
just about anything you want.

04:57.808 --> 04:59.459
It's not looking too bad.

04:59.685 --> 05:02.223
And what the guys want is
a material that matches

05:02.224 --> 05:04.975
their three key excrement metrics.

05:04.976 --> 05:08.267
So, using a combination
of materials science...

05:08.268 --> 05:09.682
That's within 2%.

05:09.683 --> 05:13.356
...Cookery skills, and his
special-effects experience...

05:13.845 --> 05:16.532
It's really nice from a
compressibility standpoint.

05:16.994 --> 05:20.971
...Jamie makes his flour-based
goop feel like real poop.

05:20.972 --> 05:22.723
And you know what?

05:23.623 --> 05:25.349
My don't stink.

05:34.910 --> 05:38.075
All right, so first up for us
in idioms... getting cold feet.

05:38.076 --> 05:39.647
Oh, meaning that
fear prohibits you

05:39.648 --> 05:41.488
from doing something you
thought you could do.

05:41.489 --> 05:43.940
Exactly, like,
"I was gonna jump out of a plane,

05:43.941 --> 05:45.114
but I got cold feet."

05:45.115 --> 05:47.257
It sounds like the
question for us is

05:47.258 --> 05:49.938
do your feet actually
physically get colder

05:49.939 --> 05:51.883
as a response to being
afraid of something?

05:53.983 --> 05:55.463
To get cold feet

05:55.464 --> 05:58.716
is a wonderfully expressive,
idiosyncratic phrase.

05:58.717 --> 06:01.053
But when the fear
factor's dialed up,

06:01.054 --> 06:04.478
does the temperature of
your feet literally go down?

06:05.861 --> 06:07.682
Okay, to test this myth,
we're going to need

06:07.683 --> 06:10.331
a super-accurate way to monitor
the temperature of our feet.

06:10.332 --> 06:12.325
I'm thinking maybe
the thermal camera

06:12.326 --> 06:14.010
and some skin-temperature probes.

06:14.011 --> 06:15.707
All right, well,
we're also gonna have to come up

06:15.708 --> 06:17.562
with some horrifying
things for us to do,

06:17.563 --> 06:19.697
so that way we can measure
the temperature of our feet

06:19.698 --> 06:22.085
before and during the experiment.

06:22.183 --> 06:24.025
Actually, dude, here's the catch.

06:24.026 --> 06:26.012
The fans have already come up

06:26.013 --> 06:27.599
with the horrible
things for us to do,

06:27.600 --> 06:28.785
and here's the list.

06:28.786 --> 06:29.949
Oh, let me see. Let me see.

06:30.412 --> 06:31.512
All right, Grant,

06:31.513 --> 06:33.529
you don't like creepy-crawly
things touching you,

06:33.530 --> 06:35.413
so that's what you're
gonna have to do.

06:35.414 --> 06:36.147
Oh, yeah?

06:36.148 --> 06:38.719
Well, you get grossed out easily,

06:38.720 --> 06:41.200
so you are gonna have
to eat something nasty.

06:41.798 --> 06:43.095
What have they got for me?

06:43.096 --> 06:44.083
Well, the fans notice

06:44.084 --> 06:45.974
that you're most freaked
out when you're at heights,

06:45.975 --> 06:47.122
so we're gonna come up

06:47.123 --> 06:48.957
with something really
gnarly for you.

06:49.053 --> 06:51.234
I can't wait to see
what you come up with.

06:51.235 --> 06:53.040
This experiment's
gonna be kind of fun,

06:53.049 --> 06:55.620
except for when it's my turn.

06:56.209 --> 06:58.608
We are testing the myth
"cold feet."

06:58.609 --> 06:59.972
Now, the idea here is

06:59.973 --> 07:02.677
that your feet actually get
colder when you get scared.

07:02.678 --> 07:03.982
How are we gonna test this?

07:03.983 --> 07:06.152
We're gonna scare the
crap out of each other.

07:06.153 --> 07:07.669
Now, how will we be able to tell

07:07.670 --> 07:09.557
if the temperature
of our feet changes?

07:09.558 --> 07:10.465
With these.

07:10.466 --> 07:11.625
We have temperature sensors

07:11.626 --> 07:13.747
that we'll tape to different
areas of our feet.

07:13.748 --> 07:16.810
These will record, every 10 seconds,
the temperature,

07:16.811 --> 07:18.796
so that way, when we're
done with the experiment,

07:18.797 --> 07:20.445
we'll be able to plug
these into a computer

07:20.446 --> 07:23.795
and find out if our feet
actually did change temperature

07:23.796 --> 07:26.152
over the duration
of the experiment.

07:26.153 --> 07:28.775
So, in addition to the sensors,
on the other foot

07:28.776 --> 07:31.153
we'll be aiming this
thermal imaging camera.

07:31.154 --> 07:33.318
It'll be able to
detect and measure

07:33.319 --> 07:35.526
minute temperature changes.

07:36.026 --> 07:38.130
The average human body
temperature varies

07:38.131 --> 07:41.015
on who, where,
and when you measure it.

07:41.601 --> 07:45.888
Okay. K.B., you are 96.3.

07:45.916 --> 07:48.781
So establishing a
baseline skin temperature

07:48.782 --> 07:51.409
while calm and
resting is essential.

07:51.410 --> 07:53.442
So, we just took the
temperature of our feet,

07:53.443 --> 07:56.246
and we're all averaging
around 96 degrees.

07:56.247 --> 07:57.721
That's gonna be our baseline.

07:57.722 --> 07:59.783
Now it's time to scare each other.

07:59.784 --> 08:01.024
Aah!

08:01.025 --> 08:04.745
And first in line for a
dose of dread is Tory.

08:04.746 --> 08:06.591
And at king city airport,

08:06.592 --> 08:09.522
Kari and Grant have lined
up a terrifying test

08:09.523 --> 08:13.049
to take advantage of
Tory's fear of heights.

08:14.207 --> 08:17.798
A high-flying ride in a stunt
plane will surely provide

08:17.799 --> 08:20.806
the necessary motivation
for cold feet.

08:21.231 --> 08:23.381
And to measure the
temperature of his feet

08:23.382 --> 08:25.828
during the buildup and
throughout the flight,

08:25.829 --> 08:28.368
Tory will be using
the skin sensors.

08:28.768 --> 08:30.630
What do you think? Think I
could do some foot modeling?

08:30.631 --> 08:32.842
Uh, maybe for fungus cream.

08:33.467 --> 08:35.683
Plus he'll be wearing
a heart-rate monitor.

08:35.683 --> 08:38.730
And the man about to
set Tory's heart racing

08:38.731 --> 08:41.369
with a not-very-encouraging
safety briefing

08:41.370 --> 08:44.892
is world-class stunt
pilot Sean d. Tucker.

08:44.893 --> 08:47.106
You got to go into this
knowing it's dangerous.

08:47.107 --> 08:52.566
You got to go into this knowing
there's not very many margins.

08:52.567 --> 08:54.041
We got some outs here and there,

08:54.042 --> 08:55.716
but, you know,
you're entering the dark side

08:55.717 --> 08:56.745
when you're gonna
go flying with me

08:56.746 --> 08:57.818
in the low-level environment.

08:57.819 --> 08:59.316
Should I have worn man diapers?

08:59.317 --> 09:02.241
And if Sean hasn't already
got Tory's attention,

09:02.242 --> 09:06.565
a description of the negative-g
forces involved surely does.

09:06.566 --> 09:09.240
We're probably gonna
do 3 1/2 negative,

09:09.481 --> 09:11.053
and that's the most
I'd ever give you

09:11.054 --> 09:13.438
because they are the
very dangerous "g."

09:13.439 --> 09:14.862
And they sneak up on you,

09:14.863 --> 09:16.338
and they can break
things in your brain,

09:16.339 --> 09:17.819
they can detach your retina,

09:17.820 --> 09:19.495
and they can make
your eyeballs bleed.

09:19.496 --> 09:20.350
Great.

09:20.500 --> 09:22.263
Dude, I'm getting cold feet.

09:22.837 --> 09:26.465
And if it sounds horrifying,
it looks even worse,

09:26.466 --> 09:28.810
because before Tory climbs aboard,

09:28.811 --> 09:32.897
Sean goes solo for an
adrenaline-inducing demonstration.

09:33.334 --> 09:34.397
You know, at first I thought

09:34.398 --> 09:37.384
Tory got the easiest
of all the tasks,

09:37.385 --> 09:39.845
but now that I've heard exactly
what he's going to go through

09:39.846 --> 09:42.822
and seen him turn green and
his face completely drop,

09:43.047 --> 09:45.189
I think this might
be just crazy enough

09:45.190 --> 09:46.966
to scare the bejesus out of him.

09:46.967 --> 09:49.384
I'm a little bit happier now.

09:49.721 --> 09:51.298
Oh, my God, he's not even flying.

09:51.299 --> 09:52.437
I think he's falling.

09:52.438 --> 09:53.526
We have these story meetings.

09:53.527 --> 09:55.413
It's like, "oh, what can
we do to scare ourselves?

09:55.414 --> 09:58.058
What would be a good test
to see if we get cold feet?"

09:59.233 --> 10:01.833
Oh, my God. Wow.

10:01.834 --> 10:03.521
Okay, now he's just showing off.

10:04.382 --> 10:06.181
Well, if he's trying to scare me,
it's working.

10:06.182 --> 10:08.660
It always seems like a good idea
when we're talking about it,

10:08.661 --> 10:10.500
like, "hey, yeah,
I'llo in a stunt plane.

10:10.501 --> 10:11.494
That sounds like fun."

10:11.495 --> 10:13.293
You're looking a little pale, man.

10:13.294 --> 10:14.902
You actually do look green.

10:14.903 --> 10:16.305
I'm not gonna lie.

10:16.693 --> 10:19.231
I can't say I'm
thrilled about this one.

10:19.505 --> 10:22.668
But after being debriefed
on what we're gonna be doing

10:22.917 --> 10:25.030
and the dangers involved...

10:26.109 --> 10:28.235
It doesn't sound like
a great idea anymore.

10:28.697 --> 10:30.847
I think I'm actually
getting cold feet.

10:32.784 --> 10:34.577
Next on "Mythbusters"...

10:34.578 --> 10:36.658
Are you okay? No.

10:36.659 --> 10:40.405
...Tory has second thoughts,
but does he get cold feet?

10:40.406 --> 10:42.096
Oh, crap.

10:48.207 --> 10:52.237
Does getting cold feet mean
you actually get cold feet?

10:52.238 --> 10:55.725
To find out, Tory's facing
his fear of heights.

10:55.975 --> 10:59.014
Cue the fright flight of his life.

11:01.176 --> 11:03.637
We just watched Sean
go up in the air

11:03.638 --> 11:05.249
and do a few maneuvers
that he's gonna do

11:05.250 --> 11:07.171
while I'm inside the plane.

11:07.172 --> 11:11.412
He's spinning towards the earth,
upside down.

11:11.937 --> 11:13.250
And I have to tell you.

11:13.662 --> 11:16.899
I looked at the numbers.
I've done the calculations.

11:17.136 --> 11:18.574
And I've come to the conclusion

11:18.575 --> 11:19.811
that I don't want
to do this anymore.

11:19.812 --> 11:21.470
Dude, he's coming straight at us.

11:21.471 --> 11:23.260
Aah! Aah!

11:23.808 --> 11:24.771
What the...

11:24.772 --> 11:26.852
Oh, my God, this guy is nuts.

11:26.853 --> 11:30.246
And I'm trusting my
life in his hands?

11:30.471 --> 11:31.821
What if he passes out?

11:32.195 --> 11:34.333
I mean, what if this
is his day to go?

11:34.437 --> 11:36.925
I think all of us
were sort of wondering

11:36.926 --> 11:39.410
if Tory was really gonna
be afraid of this,

11:39.411 --> 11:43.022
because this is basically
an adrenaline-type activity,

11:43.023 --> 11:44.490
which Tory enjoys.

11:44.894 --> 11:46.704
So, to make sure,

11:46.705 --> 11:51.077
Kari and I have been waging
psychological warfare on Tory.

11:51.078 --> 11:53.094
If we have to jump, I'm gonna say,

11:53.331 --> 11:55.205
"bail out, bail out, bail out."

11:55.206 --> 11:58.880
And then after we've
explained all of the dangers

11:58.881 --> 12:02.180
including your parachute,
you know, not opening,

12:02.181 --> 12:03.581
you bumping off the tail.

12:03.582 --> 12:05.669
Be prepared.
You're gonna hit the tail.

12:05.917 --> 12:08.726
Boom, and you just
push yourself away.

12:08.727 --> 12:12.579
And hopefully by that time,
he's in the mind space

12:12.580 --> 12:17.244
where he can be anxiety-ridden
enough to have cold feet.

12:17.245 --> 12:19.869
Are you okay? No.

12:22.145 --> 12:23.468
And that right there

12:23.469 --> 12:26.043
is the look of a man
getting cold feet.

12:26.044 --> 12:27.641
But we won't know for sure

12:27.642 --> 12:30.923
until we access the foot
sensors after the test.

12:30.924 --> 12:35.665
But right now, for Tory,
after seems like a lifetime away.

12:35.674 --> 12:37.761
Oh, crap.

12:37.953 --> 12:39.912
As last words go, Tory,

12:39.913 --> 12:42.029
you might want to rethink those.

12:45.427 --> 12:46.564
Here we go.

12:51.714 --> 12:55.389
Oh, man. What are we doing?

13:11.023 --> 13:12.098
Bye.

13:16.276 --> 13:17.812
My heart rate just spiked.

13:17.813 --> 13:18.781
What are you?

13:19.081 --> 13:21.026
I'm over 100. Okay.

13:21.027 --> 13:24.501
Ohh. Let's see if I get cold feet.

13:25.614 --> 13:28.839
And if the anxiety juices
weren't already flowing...

13:29.138 --> 13:31.263
My palms are definitely sweaty.

13:35.032 --> 13:37.682
...There's the
tortuously slow climb

13:37.683 --> 13:40.895
to gain the required altitude
for the first maneuver.

13:41.269 --> 13:45.052
So not only is Tory now
anticipating the chaos to come,

13:45.053 --> 13:48.549
he's doing it way above
his comfort zone.

13:48.550 --> 13:51.324
I believe he's starting
with the inverted flat spin.

13:51.689 --> 13:53.681
Oh, man, yeah. You good now?

13:53.682 --> 13:55.605
Here we go. You ready? All right.

13:59.302 --> 14:04.264
Two. Three. Four.

14:04.430 --> 14:06.582
Oh, my gosh.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.768
You doing good? Yep.

14:08.917 --> 14:10.821
You're doing good? Oh, my God.

14:10.822 --> 14:13.247
How's that feel? Oh, my God.

14:14.077 --> 14:15.003
Ah.

14:15.952 --> 14:16.916
What's your heart rate?

14:16.917 --> 14:19.241
Uh...140.

14:20.991 --> 14:24.641
I have a feeling if he's
got cold feet right now.

14:24.968 --> 14:27.965
Oh, my God, that was terrifying.

14:28.179 --> 14:29.503
Whoo!

14:31.828 --> 14:34.355
They are not going
easy on him, are they?

14:34.356 --> 14:36.793
Nope, and for the next 15 minutes,

14:36.794 --> 14:38.954
Sean puts Tory
through the wringer,

14:38.955 --> 14:40.692
doing everything he can

14:40.693 --> 14:44.185
to scare the pants off
Tory and freeze his feet.

14:44.186 --> 14:47.847
Wow, the earth just keeps
moving all over the place.

14:50.882 --> 14:54.231
Oh, my God. Aah!

14:55.955 --> 14:56.755
Oh!

15:02.580 --> 15:03.194
You okay?

15:03.195 --> 15:05.218
I'm okay. How you feel?

15:05.219 --> 15:06.481
Oh, man.

15:07.710 --> 15:10.268
All right!

15:10.269 --> 15:14.198
Everything's good?
Everything's good?

15:14.199 --> 15:16.912
With Tory just about
hanging onto his lunch,

15:16.913 --> 15:21.285
it's time to bring him and
this test back down to earth.

15:21.286 --> 15:23.598
All right, Sean,
I think we got enough data.

15:23.599 --> 15:25.836
And I think I'm done.

15:29.511 --> 15:31.845
I made it. I made it.

15:31.846 --> 15:33.475
That was brutal.

15:33.476 --> 15:36.669
But the worst part wasn't
the actual maneuvers.

15:36.670 --> 15:38.831
Well, I mean,
it was partly the maneuvers.

15:38.832 --> 15:40.637
But it was right
before the maneuvers,

15:40.638 --> 15:42.313
the fear of the unknown.

15:42.314 --> 15:45.301
All right! Whoo! Whoo!

15:45.777 --> 15:46.801
It's empty.

15:47.113 --> 15:48.774
Oh, clean bag!

15:48.775 --> 15:51.610
Oh, my gosh, that was insane.

15:51.998 --> 15:53.599
Ohh!

15:54.175 --> 15:55.279
Let's go crunch some data,

15:55.280 --> 15:57.151
find out if you
actually got cold feet.

15:57.152 --> 15:58.875
Yeah, let's go look at the data.

15:59.709 --> 16:00.609
Aah!

16:00.820 --> 16:03.246
That was so intense.

16:03.247 --> 16:05.130
All right, well,
are you ready for our results?

16:05.131 --> 16:06.029
Yes. All right.

16:06.030 --> 16:07.579
Okay, well, you know
that your heart rate

16:07.580 --> 16:09.807
was elevated the entire day,
right? Yeah.

16:09.808 --> 16:12.640
Okay, well, if we look at the
temperature of your feet,

16:12.641 --> 16:14.402
all the way up to the plane ride,

16:14.403 --> 16:17.296
it's at 96.2, which is exactly
the same as your baseline.

16:17.297 --> 16:18.586
Seriously? Yeah.

16:18.587 --> 16:20.275
That's not looking
good for the myth.

16:20.276 --> 16:22.715
I mean, I know I might have
looked like I was having fun,

16:22.716 --> 16:24.311
but I was actually terrified.

16:24.312 --> 16:25.423
Yeah, but check this out.

16:25.424 --> 16:27.093
Before each of the big stunts,

16:27.094 --> 16:29.383
there was a slight drop in
temperature in your feet.

16:29.384 --> 16:31.147
Yeah, but it's only
a degree or two.

16:31.312 --> 16:34.653
Before getting into the plane,
I was actually terrified,

16:34.654 --> 16:36.563
and then before each
of those maneuvers,

16:36.564 --> 16:37.858
I was dreading it.

16:37.859 --> 16:40.151
But, I mean, such a small
change in temperature...

16:40.152 --> 16:41.896
we can't call this one yet.

16:41.897 --> 16:43.107
After the break...

16:43.108 --> 16:44.658
Ohh.

16:45.371 --> 16:47.608
...The poop starts flying.

16:52.629 --> 16:55.144
Interesting idioms
and the odd adage

16:55.145 --> 16:58.698
have proven to be fertile
territory for the Mythbusters.

17:01.484 --> 17:02.323
Dude.

17:03.685 --> 17:05.421
That is a lead balloon.

17:07.671 --> 17:11.196
So who better to make a
whole heap of fake poop...

17:11.198 --> 17:13.271
It's time to go into
mass production.

17:13.271 --> 17:14.912
...And see what really happens

17:14.913 --> 17:16.714
when it hits the fan?

17:16.714 --> 17:20.823
While we're at it, we're gonna
add a little blue food coloring.

17:21.248 --> 17:24.319
I don't know. Maybe it won't
gross people out so much.

17:24.320 --> 17:26.709
Once Jamie has squeezed...

17:26.710 --> 17:28.134
Ohh.

17:28.135 --> 17:31.420
...His physically accurate
excrement analogue

17:31.421 --> 17:33.946
into individual poop portions...

17:34.308 --> 17:37.120
...The turd tossing can begin.

17:37.400 --> 17:39.512
I think we're ready to test.

17:42.636 --> 17:45.001
You've probably already figured
out what we're going to do here,

17:45.002 --> 17:46.148
but I'll explain anyway.

17:46.149 --> 17:49.216
We're gonna hurl these
poos at this fan

17:49.217 --> 17:52.565
inside this 310-degree surround.

17:52.566 --> 17:55.438
The idea is that anything
that flies off this fan

17:55.439 --> 17:58.160
will be clearly visible
on this surround.

17:58.161 --> 17:59.523
Shall we get started?

18:01.173 --> 18:01.872
All right.

18:01.873 --> 18:04.061
Oh, it feels really...

18:04.415 --> 18:05.860
uh-huh. It's impressive.

18:05.861 --> 18:07.215
All right, here we go.

18:07.548 --> 18:10.384
In three, two, one.

18:13.945 --> 18:15.284
That... that was...

18:15.696 --> 18:17.634
I have to say I'm a
little disappointed.

18:17.958 --> 18:20.935
Well, you know, we kind of figured,
with that screen on it,

18:20.936 --> 18:24.528
it's not gonna fully penetrate
the blades of the fan.

18:24.529 --> 18:26.238
Right. The screen is out.

18:26.239 --> 18:28.008
But a closer look reveals

18:28.009 --> 18:29.703
that although it
wasn't as disappointing

18:29.704 --> 18:31.122
as they first thought...

18:32.246 --> 18:33.333
Oh, but look.

18:33.758 --> 18:35.871
There's actually a fair
bit of coverage over here.

18:36.220 --> 18:39.026
...Those few tiny
specks are by no means

18:39.027 --> 18:41.769
a dung-splattering home run.

18:41.770 --> 18:46.232
So cue take two, and this time,
free from its protective guard,

18:46.233 --> 18:50.409
will the fan slice, dice,
and fling feces in all directions?

18:50.410 --> 18:51.920
All right, here we go.

18:52.383 --> 18:57.079
One fan minus one grill
plus one poo equals...

18:58.558 --> 19:00.921
Equals a whole lot of not much,

19:00.922 --> 19:03.970
and so far the myth is
looking like a bust.

19:03.971 --> 19:08.075
With or without the grill,
poop is physically hitting the fan,

19:08.076 --> 19:11.297
but the odd splattered
speck does not constitute

19:11.298 --> 19:14.294
the catastrophe the idiom implies.

19:14.667 --> 19:16.605
But the guys aren't giving up yet.

19:16.606 --> 19:20.291
These preliminary tests
have yielded some info.

19:20.690 --> 19:22.218
I'll tell you what
I didn't expect.

19:22.219 --> 19:23.470
I thought that the cage

19:23.471 --> 19:26.308
would actually prevent the
poop from reaching the blades.

19:26.309 --> 19:28.096
I thought it was
like a non-starter,

19:28.097 --> 19:30.450
when it fact it acted more
like a kitchen implement,

19:30.451 --> 19:33.517
slicing and dicing the poop so
that it actually spread better

19:33.518 --> 19:36.261
with the cage on
than the cage off.

19:36.262 --> 19:38.299
Where does that leave us?
Where do we go from here?

19:38.300 --> 19:40.081
Where do we always go from here?

19:40.082 --> 19:41.099
Bigger...

19:41.549 --> 19:44.490
From a 12-inch fan
to a 20-inch fan...

19:44.491 --> 19:47.998
bigger cage, and the
blades are made of metal.

19:48.324 --> 19:49.236
Yeah.

19:50.404 --> 19:54.353
So, let's see if the
mean metal fan can.

19:54.540 --> 19:55.827
That worked pretty well.

19:55.990 --> 19:58.765
Oh, yeah, not bad.

19:59.941 --> 20:02.238
Not bad is not good enough.

20:02.239 --> 20:03.729
When the poop hits the fan,

20:03.730 --> 20:07.462
you expect a disaster of
poop-storm proportions.

20:09.076 --> 20:11.448
And so far, that hasn't happened.

20:11.449 --> 20:13.430
But that doesn't mean
it's not possible.

20:13.431 --> 20:16.119
Perhaps some combination
of variables,

20:16.120 --> 20:18.269
like the direction
and speed of the fan,

20:18.270 --> 20:20.072
or consistency of the poop,

20:20.073 --> 20:21.636
will make it happen.

20:22.023 --> 20:23.646
Before we start in
on other variables,

20:23.647 --> 20:24.937
I'd like to remove one.

20:24.938 --> 20:27.416
I don't want to rely on
myself for flinging the poo.

20:27.417 --> 20:30.566
I'd like to make a
repeatable poo thrower.

20:30.567 --> 20:31.968
Adam's now gonna build a rig

20:31.969 --> 20:35.589
that consistently throws
poo at 30 miles per hour.

20:35.590 --> 20:38.031
Yep, before they embark
on a series of tests

20:38.032 --> 20:41.262
that will isolate the myth's
best chance of being confirmed,

20:41.263 --> 20:43.314
they need some consistency.

20:43.676 --> 20:47.207
Unfortunately, Adam,
with his funky rotating catapult,

20:47.208 --> 20:50.625
seems to be consistently
missing the target.

20:51.088 --> 20:53.038
After four hours of work on this,

20:53.087 --> 20:55.480
it's really pretty,
but I think I have to abandon it.

20:55.481 --> 20:57.751
Not only is it not
going fast enough...

20:57.752 --> 20:59.741
a potentially fixable problem...

20:59.742 --> 21:02.637
it's not aiming anything
close to reliably.

21:02.638 --> 21:05.419
It's ending up on the floor.
The poo's ending up on the ceiling.

21:05.442 --> 21:08.425
I need it to be 100% reliable
in order to use this.

21:08.426 --> 21:11.978
So I'm gonna cut it to pieces
and try something else.

21:12.617 --> 21:15.954
Something else being a more
traditional catapult design

21:15.955 --> 21:18.106
that not only gives good speed...

21:19.418 --> 21:20.294
31.

21:20.703 --> 21:22.930
31! Nice!

21:22.931 --> 21:27.327
...It gets the round poop in
the square hole every time.

21:27.977 --> 21:30.149
Shall we get to testing?
I think so.

21:30.150 --> 21:30.947
All right.

21:32.659 --> 21:34.353
Coming up next on "Mythbusters,"

21:34.354 --> 21:37.321
face the arachnichair.

21:45.698 --> 21:48.335
Kari and Grant have shaken,
stirred,

21:48.336 --> 21:51.160
and taken Tory to
terrifying heights

21:51.161 --> 21:53.247
to find out if getting cold feet

21:53.248 --> 21:56.648
is a physical fact
or idiomatic fiction.

21:57.685 --> 21:58.779
Aah!

21:58.780 --> 22:01.034
Now, while it might sound
like a clever old saying,

22:01.035 --> 22:03.861
there could actually
be a biological basis

22:03.862 --> 22:05.152
for getting cold feet.

22:05.153 --> 22:06.638
When we experience fear,

22:06.639 --> 22:09.359
our bodies go through an
immediate and automatic response

22:09.360 --> 22:11.124
called the
fight-or-flight response,

22:11.125 --> 22:13.189
and that's the brain
preparing the body

22:13.190 --> 22:16.768
to either fight the threat
or run away from it.

22:16.769 --> 22:19.889
And a number of things happen,
but the important one for us

22:19.890 --> 22:21.970
is that the blood
vessels constrict,

22:21.971 --> 22:24.967
forcing blood towards the
major muscle groups...

22:24.968 --> 22:28.237
the ones that you might use
for fighting or running away.

22:28.523 --> 22:32.393
What that does is it takes blood
away from the extremities,

22:32.394 --> 22:35.159
which, normally,
the blood warms the extremities.

22:35.160 --> 22:39.810
So you could actually experience
cold hands or cold feet.

22:40.049 --> 22:42.127
And to see if Grant
gets cold feet,

22:42.128 --> 22:44.506
Kari and Tory have a devious plan

22:44.507 --> 22:47.424
that involves a spot
of phobia shopping.

22:47.425 --> 22:48.231
Owen.

22:48.232 --> 22:50.323
Kari, Tory, hi, how you doing?

22:50.324 --> 22:53.711
So, we need some creepy-crawly
things to freak Grant out,

22:53.712 --> 22:55.184
and we thought this would
be a good place to come.

22:55.185 --> 22:58.491
And with that, the guys get
right to the dark heart

22:58.492 --> 23:00.096
of Grant's nightmares...

23:00.393 --> 23:03.029
hairy, scary spiders.

23:03.262 --> 23:07.134
So, what we have here is
avicularia avicularia,

23:07.397 --> 23:09.671
the pink-toed tarantula.

23:10.035 --> 23:12.485
Man, they look hungry.

23:12.505 --> 23:14.257
Okay, so, I'm thinking...

23:14.344 --> 23:17.619
Whoa! These things
are gonna be perfect.

23:17.620 --> 23:19.781
...Jumping, active,
furry spiders all over Grant's head.

23:19.782 --> 23:21.196
How many of these do you have?

23:21.197 --> 23:22.228
25.

23:22.229 --> 23:23.611
I think that's perfect.

23:23.612 --> 23:26.066
This is gonna freak
him out for sure.

23:26.890 --> 23:27.696
Aah!

23:27.697 --> 23:30.851
Back at base, Kari and
Tory get down to business

23:30.852 --> 23:33.559
building a rig that
will put Grant in touch,

23:33.560 --> 23:36.043
literally, with his
eight-legged fears.

23:36.044 --> 23:37.358
So, what have we got here?

23:37.359 --> 23:38.103
Well, this would be

23:38.104 --> 23:43.011
your basic arachnid containment
and dispensary unit.

23:43.280 --> 23:46.452
Right here we've got the
tarantula delivery hole,

23:46.453 --> 23:50.011
so that we can be dropping the
spiders right on Grant's head.

23:50.311 --> 23:51.871
It's made out of a clear acrylic.

23:51.872 --> 23:53.953
And at the bottom right here,

23:53.954 --> 23:57.217
we have the
Grant-to-spider adapter.

23:57.642 --> 24:01.052
And with the torturee all
hooked up to the foot sensors

24:01.053 --> 24:03.194
and test time fast approaching...

24:03.541 --> 24:05.541
I'u a little... little nervous.

24:07.003 --> 24:08.291
...Our test subject

24:08.292 --> 24:11.222
is not exactly thinking
warm and fuzzy thoughts.

24:11.497 --> 24:12.693
Okay, so, it's well known

24:12.694 --> 24:15.042
that I don't like the
fish touching me.

24:15.043 --> 24:15.771
Help!

24:15.772 --> 24:18.293
On previous episodes,
I've mentioned this.

24:18.682 --> 24:20.480
Something just touched me!

24:20.481 --> 24:23.770
The spiders, I think, are, um...

24:23.771 --> 24:25.793
Help! Help!

24:26.068 --> 24:28.686
Well, they're...
they're on par, I think,

24:28.687 --> 24:29.887
with the fish touching me.

24:30.461 --> 24:33.498
Somehow, Grant,
I think this is gonna top that.

24:33.499 --> 24:34.404
Good to meet you.

24:34.405 --> 24:36.990
And this is our chair.

24:37.841 --> 24:39.327
The arachnichair.

24:39.328 --> 24:42.292
And this is going
to be living hell.

24:42.293 --> 24:45.742
Now, Grant has known roughly
what he was in for for a while.

24:45.743 --> 24:47.856
But as he takes in the details...

24:47.857 --> 24:49.180
Wait a minute. Here you go.

24:49.305 --> 24:51.430
That way the spiders
don't get in your eyes.

24:51.562 --> 24:53.613
...You can literally see his brain

24:53.614 --> 24:57.394
chemically shouting at his body,
"run, Grant, run."

24:57.544 --> 25:00.693
What we don't know is
whether that feeling of fear

25:00.694 --> 25:02.806
will result in cold feet.

25:05.054 --> 25:07.017
Get the spiders. Mm-hmm.

25:13.001 --> 25:16.163
While testing the idiom
"when poop hits the fan,"

25:16.164 --> 25:19.243
Adam and Jamie have seen
some promising signs.

25:19.244 --> 25:22.899
We're seeing our simulated
poo spread radially outwards

25:22.900 --> 25:24.488
directly from the blades.

25:24.738 --> 25:26.674
But for the myth to be confirmed,

25:26.675 --> 25:30.287
they need the feces to
fly to all four corners.

25:31.346 --> 25:35.401
So I've divided our testing
surround into four quadrants.

25:35.402 --> 25:38.341
This'll allow us to, test by test,

25:38.342 --> 25:41.069
quantify the type of
spread we're getting

25:41.070 --> 25:43.594
from each of the
iterations we're trying.

25:43.907 --> 25:45.415
So, now they're gonna run through

25:45.416 --> 25:48.068
all the possible combinations
that will give the myth

25:48.069 --> 25:50.656
its best possible
chance of success...

25:51.557 --> 25:53.893
Okay, so, high-speed fan,

25:54.081 --> 25:55.606
frontal direction,

25:55.831 --> 25:57.765
and regular poo.

25:57.766 --> 25:59.857
...The fan's speed, direction,

25:59.858 --> 26:02.673
and the consistency of
the material in question.

26:02.674 --> 26:05.260
And in a blur of a turd toss...

26:07.735 --> 26:09.935
Did you get some on you? I did.

26:10.397 --> 26:12.735
...And spray-pattern analyzing...

26:13.009 --> 26:15.447
Couple of spatters
in quadrant one.

26:15.708 --> 26:18.476
...The guys cover all the
possible permutations

26:18.477 --> 26:20.883
with poop of regular consistency.

26:20.884 --> 26:23.816
Obviously, poop comes in all
different kinds of consistencies,

26:23.817 --> 26:25.882
and we've tried a firmer version.

26:25.883 --> 26:28.202
Now it's time to try
a softer version.

26:28.203 --> 26:32.172
And Jamie's so proud of his new,
softer poo formula,

26:32.173 --> 26:34.421
he's getting all artistic on us.

26:34.422 --> 26:37.532
I'm actually developing
quite the technique here.

26:37.944 --> 26:40.869
I find it's best
to start vertical,

26:41.749 --> 26:44.636
doing a nice, tight, little coil,

26:44.786 --> 26:46.786
staying directly above.

26:47.512 --> 26:51.536
And then the trick is,
right as you come to the top,

26:51.834 --> 26:55.258
to do a little twist
with the plunger...

26:57.582 --> 27:00.444
ohh... while pulling up...

27:00.685 --> 27:03.708
And you get a nice, perky,
little tip at the end.

27:04.869 --> 27:07.281
Oh, yeah, wow.

27:08.182 --> 27:10.218
Oh, that feels just
like when my dog

27:10.219 --> 27:12.006
has been eating too
much soft food.

27:12.318 --> 27:15.181
Soft poo, from the front,
high-speed.

27:18.806 --> 27:22.643
Ohh. That's a whole
different kettle of fish.

27:24.733 --> 27:29.020
Much finer spray,
and we got a lot on the front one

27:29.021 --> 27:30.512
and some all the way on the back.

27:30.513 --> 27:33.808
Ohh, nice.
I think we're advancing.

27:34.477 --> 27:36.575
But that was as good as it gets...

27:36.576 --> 27:39.776
In three, two, one.

27:40.455 --> 27:42.611
...Because none of the
remaining combinations

27:42.612 --> 27:45.178
improve on that first
set of results.

27:45.658 --> 27:47.992
Well, we've determined
the worst-case scenario,

27:47.993 --> 27:49.132
which is the softer poo

27:49.133 --> 27:51.361
into the fan from the
front at high-speed.

27:51.362 --> 27:52.430
We're still not
getting the universal

27:52.431 --> 27:54.483
coverage that we're looking for.

27:54.484 --> 27:57.683
This myth is all about
complete catastrophe.

27:57.684 --> 28:00.339
And now that they know what
will give them the best chance,

28:00.340 --> 28:03.596
it's time to take
this test full-scale.

28:03.797 --> 28:07.078
Coming up, Grant digs
deep for science,

28:07.301 --> 28:11.101
and Adam marshals the
flat-packed poo platoon.

28:16.123 --> 28:18.810
Grant has his butt
in the arachnichair

28:18.811 --> 28:20.229
and his head in a box...

28:20.230 --> 28:23.948
a box that, in just a
few fear-filled moments,

28:23.949 --> 28:28.259
Kari and Tory will fill with
crawlies that creep Grant out...

28:28.260 --> 28:31.042
tarantulas...25 of them.

28:31.043 --> 28:34.341
Okay, Grant, I want you to meet

28:34.342 --> 28:36.680
avicularia avicularia,

28:37.630 --> 28:41.266
more commonly known as
the pink-toed tarantula.

28:41.496 --> 28:45.020
And to find out if Grant's
toes go from pink to blue,

28:45.021 --> 28:47.770
skin sensors are
monitoring one foot,

28:47.771 --> 28:49.970
and the other is
on thermal camera.

28:49.971 --> 28:53.395
They come from Brazil,
and they're aggressive eaters.

28:54.446 --> 28:55.832
As for the test parameters,

28:55.833 --> 28:58.797
Grant can call a halt to
proceedings whenever he wants.

28:58.798 --> 29:01.244
The e.M.T.S are on standby.

29:01.245 --> 29:03.720
Heart rate just jumped to 139.

29:03.895 --> 29:05.750
He has to keep his eyes open,

29:05.751 --> 29:08.964
and the test will last a
maximum of two minutes,

29:09.000 --> 29:10.475
which starts now.

29:10.813 --> 29:11.962
You ready? Here we go.

29:13.412 --> 29:14.850
Whoa.

29:15.691 --> 29:16.718
Keep your eyes open.

29:16.719 --> 29:18.982
Look at that dark one. Whoo!

29:28.970 --> 29:31.000
One more minute.
Kari: One more minute, Grant.

29:31.001 --> 29:32.973
Ah! Oh, my God.

29:33.371 --> 29:35.062
Oh, look at this one in his hair.

29:36.007 --> 29:37.357
Last spider.

29:42.557 --> 29:44.666
That one went straight
across his face.

29:44.667 --> 29:48.616
All the spiders are in,
and Grant is clearly scared.

29:48.866 --> 29:51.181
30 seconds left. 30 seconds left.

29:51.182 --> 29:53.564
What's also clear is
this is going to be

29:53.565 --> 29:56.244
the longest 30
seconds of his life.

29:56.245 --> 29:58.330
Trapped in the enclosed space,

29:58.331 --> 30:02.234
the spiders skitter,
scurry, creep, and crawl

30:02.235 --> 30:03.893
across his face and hair.

30:04.255 --> 30:08.468
It is, quite literally,
the stuff nightmares are made of.

30:11.070 --> 30:14.395
But finally,
he hears the magic words.

30:14.458 --> 30:16.844
Okay, let's take the box off.
All right, here we go.

30:16.845 --> 30:19.619
There's no spiders around his neck,
so we can slide this off.

30:19.620 --> 30:22.020
Wait, hold on, hold on.
Okay, good. Okay.

30:22.021 --> 30:23.708
Nice work, buddy.

30:23.709 --> 30:25.584
You made it! Yay!

30:29.211 --> 30:31.288
At least now I got an answer to,

30:31.289 --> 30:34.421
"what's the worst thing
you've ever done on the show?"

30:36.609 --> 30:37.372
You okay?

30:38.172 --> 30:38.896
Yeah.

30:39.083 --> 30:42.100
I don't really think I can
adequately describe that...

30:42.101 --> 30:45.000
that... that scurrying...

30:45.471 --> 30:47.376
Uh, that sensation.

30:47.377 --> 30:51.695
It's just like, not only
is it a really scary thing,

30:52.020 --> 30:53.970
but you just can't get away.

30:55.046 --> 30:56.300
Well, the experiment's over.

30:56.301 --> 30:57.680
We've got your baseline.

30:57.681 --> 30:59.245
We've got your temperature
during the test.

30:59.246 --> 31:00.709
We've got your temperature
before the test.

31:00.710 --> 31:02.387
So we're gonna go
compare all the results,

31:02.388 --> 31:03.556
and we'll tell you
if you got cold feet.

31:03.557 --> 31:06.318
Yeah, and by the looks of it,
I think you might have.

31:06.319 --> 31:08.057
I think I might have, too.

31:11.434 --> 31:12.810
All right, so, where do we stand?

31:12.811 --> 31:15.363
We are testing the idiomatic phrase,
"poop hitting the fan,"

31:15.364 --> 31:18.619
and we've taken as our guide
the soul of that phrase,

31:18.620 --> 31:20.716
which, to us, is,
when poop hits a fan,

31:20.717 --> 31:23.231
everyone around that fan
gets covered with poop,

31:23.232 --> 31:24.826
the worst-possible-case scenario.

31:24.827 --> 31:28.217
And we've tried pretty much
everything we can think of.

31:28.218 --> 31:29.762
We've tried hard poop.
We've tried soft poop.

31:29.763 --> 31:32.557
We've tried fast fans, slow fans,
plastic fans, metal fans,

31:32.558 --> 31:34.000
throwing it at the front,
throwing it at the back,

31:34.001 --> 31:36.205
and we've determined
really pretty definitively

31:36.542 --> 31:39.100
that any given poop
and any given fan

31:39.101 --> 31:41.417
do not equal universal coverage.

31:41.767 --> 31:42.966
But, of course,
we're not gonna leave it there,

31:42.967 --> 31:46.139
because we want to know
what would it take?

31:46.140 --> 31:48.277
And right now, we're
thinking what it would take

31:48.278 --> 31:52.364
is a really, really big fan and
a lot more room to work in.

31:54.176 --> 31:55.814
More room to work, you say?

31:55.815 --> 31:58.595
The hangar at the abandoned
Alameda naval base

31:58.596 --> 32:00.338
should probably do it.

32:00.414 --> 32:01.860
Right now, this is nothing

32:01.861 --> 32:05.130
but a massive
90,000-square-foot empty room.

32:05.131 --> 32:07.560
They used to build airplanes
here during world war ii,

32:07.561 --> 32:09.810
but soon, right
where I'm standing,

32:09.811 --> 32:12.055
the is gonna hit the fan.

32:12.730 --> 32:16.099
Yep, it's the perfect location
to take this test full-scale,

32:16.100 --> 32:19.410
and to confirm the catastrophic
consequences of the myth,

32:19.411 --> 32:22.710
they'll need to see everyone
in the vicinity covered.

32:22.711 --> 32:24.954
I wonder how they're
gonna test that.

32:25.590 --> 32:28.729
You may wonder how we're gonna
test the full spread of the poo

32:28.730 --> 32:29.841
in this large-scale experiment.

32:29.842 --> 32:31.001
Wonder no more.

32:31.002 --> 32:32.863
For the last two decades,

32:32.864 --> 32:35.741
I have been slowly
growing my own clone army

32:35.742 --> 32:38.285
specifically for
scientific testing.

32:38.522 --> 32:39.860
You ready, boys?

32:40.409 --> 32:41.459
They're ready.

32:41.966 --> 32:43.468
This right here is our fan.

32:43.469 --> 32:46.474
It's a 30-inch-diameter,
1,100-rpm,

32:46.475 --> 32:49.028
1/4-horsepower cage fan.

32:51.029 --> 32:54.125
Next, the guys put the
poop-delivery device into place,

32:54.126 --> 32:56.996
a state-of-the-art piece
of hoosier hardware

32:56.997 --> 32:58.900
called the Hyneman.

33:00.558 --> 33:02.596
That seems ideal. Yeah.

33:03.033 --> 33:06.241
Next, Jamie mixes up
plenty of poop substitute,

33:06.242 --> 33:08.553
using the same soft-serve formula

33:08.554 --> 33:10.908
that gave him the best
results in the shop.

33:11.358 --> 33:13.638
And if you thought no
one in their right mind

33:13.639 --> 33:16.367
would want to stand at the
eye of the poop storm,

33:16.408 --> 33:17.600
you'd be wrong.

33:17.601 --> 33:19.370
You didn't think I'd
pass up an opportunity

33:19.371 --> 33:21.075
to be part of this
experiment, did you?

33:23.546 --> 33:25.486
You know you look
taller in person?

33:26.046 --> 33:28.081
If there's any substance
to this idiom,

33:28.082 --> 33:30.229
when I'm done,
there should be blue poo

33:30.230 --> 33:32.969
on all of these dummies,
including Adam.

33:34.469 --> 33:35.501
Coming up on "Mythbusters,"

33:35.502 --> 33:36.933
would you eat one of these things?

33:37.391 --> 33:38.353
Get in there, fella.

33:44.702 --> 33:45.803
Grant has just had

33:45.804 --> 33:48.466
a face full of
spiders for science.

33:48.467 --> 33:50.193
But what do the numbers say?

33:50.194 --> 33:53.632
Oh! I thought Grant
was gonna pass out.

33:53.633 --> 33:54.757
What are his results?

33:54.758 --> 33:55.982
Okay, check this out.

33:56.182 --> 33:58.407
For his control, heart rate, 87,

33:58.408 --> 34:01.370
temperature of his feet, 96.3.

34:01.371 --> 34:02.796
Okay, that's normal.

34:03.058 --> 34:05.495
Okay, we stick the
spiders in front of him,

34:05.670 --> 34:07.907
heart rate, 139,

34:08.083 --> 34:11.342
and the temperature of
his feet dropped to 81.9

34:11.342 --> 34:13.510
and remained that temperature

34:13.511 --> 34:15.442
for the rest of the time
the spiders were on him.

34:15.443 --> 34:18.217
Wow. He actually got cold feet.

34:18.417 --> 34:21.254
An impressive drop of 15 degrees

34:21.255 --> 34:23.681
means the myth is heading
in the right direction.

34:23.683 --> 34:26.859
But remember, Tory's
test was inconclusive,

34:26.860 --> 34:29.659
so the guys can't
call the result yet...

34:30.045 --> 34:31.020
Aah!

34:31.047 --> 34:33.822
...Which means it's
Kari's turn to step up,

34:33.822 --> 34:37.609
bare her sole for science,
and face her worst fears...

34:37.610 --> 34:40.411
a meal made by Grant and Tory.

34:41.030 --> 34:41.884
To cold feet.

34:41.885 --> 34:43.408
And warm bugs.

34:43.409 --> 34:46.197
Their challenge is to
present vegetarian Kari

34:46.197 --> 34:48.859
with a buffet that
will cause her pause,

34:48.860 --> 34:52.121
a feast of fear to
give her cold feet.

34:52.346 --> 34:54.687
Now, preparing this feast,
if you can call it that,

34:54.688 --> 34:56.054
has been disgusting.

34:56.056 --> 34:57.177
I mean, it smells bad.

34:57.178 --> 34:58.798
I think that's done.

34:58.885 --> 35:01.627
It looks bad. It's gooey.
It's slimy.

35:01.628 --> 35:06.722
And then to finish it off...
A healthy coating of slime.

35:07.685 --> 35:09.968
I mean, I'm about this close
to throwing up myself,

35:09.969 --> 35:11.637
and I got a strong stomach.

35:11.638 --> 35:14.106
This is the largest snail
in American waters.

35:14.107 --> 35:15.868
I cannot imagine
what Kari is gonna do

35:15.869 --> 35:18.519
when she comes out and
sees what she has to eat.

35:18.520 --> 35:20.107
Oh, it smells so bad.

35:20.108 --> 35:21.687
And seated at her table,

35:21.688 --> 35:23.463
with her foot on thermal camera

35:23.464 --> 35:25.879
and her heart-rate
monitor on her wrist,

35:25.880 --> 35:30.028
her eyes are about to be
assaulted along with her nose.

35:31.840 --> 35:34.939
Okay. Hey, here's our buffet.

35:34.940 --> 35:37.642
We have chicken fingers,
which is a delicacy...

35:37.643 --> 35:39.630
Oh, God....In the
American south and China.

35:39.631 --> 35:42.417
Abalone. This is conch a la Grant.

35:42.418 --> 35:46.982
We have kidney and liver,
both uncooked and cooked,

35:46.983 --> 35:49.168
flavored with abalone slime.

35:49.169 --> 35:50.371
That way you have a choice.

35:50.372 --> 35:51.933
Don't forget the bung gut.

35:51.934 --> 35:55.411
Yeah, that is basically the
end of a pig's intestine,

35:55.412 --> 35:56.351
deep-fried.

35:56.352 --> 35:59.283
Incredibly, in addition
to this feast of fear,

35:59.284 --> 36:02.155
the guys are throwing in
a little live action...

36:02.156 --> 36:06.258
the specials supplied by Owen,
our provedore of phobias.

36:06.259 --> 36:09.737
Okay, I am sweating.
My palms are wet.

36:09.738 --> 36:11.582
Now, in case you're
thinking Grant and Tory

36:11.583 --> 36:13.477
are being unreasonably cruel,

36:13.478 --> 36:15.713
Kari doesn't have
to eat everything,

36:15.714 --> 36:17.197
just an entr*** and main.

36:17.198 --> 36:18.782
Choose any two.

36:19.222 --> 36:21.756
Well, uh, hmm.

36:21.842 --> 36:24.031
I can definitely eliminate a few.

36:24.416 --> 36:27.155
I'm not going to eat
anything that had...

36:28.617 --> 36:30.853
Any cuteness in its lifetime.

36:31.378 --> 36:33.671
The boys know I have
a very limited diet.

36:33.672 --> 36:35.290
I... I don't... I don't eat...

36:35.291 --> 36:37.379
I don't eat mammals.

36:38.304 --> 36:40.545
Definitely don't eat
things that are slimy.

36:40.546 --> 36:44.733
So...The bugs, strangely enough,

36:44.734 --> 36:47.240
were the best choice for me.

36:47.241 --> 36:50.434
They seemed the most sanitary,
considering most of this stuff

36:50.435 --> 36:52.152
was prepared in the shop, anyway.

36:52.315 --> 36:54.326
Come on, giant
hissing cockroach...

36:54.327 --> 36:57.027
just bite the head off,
and the rest is just like butter.

36:57.327 --> 36:59.093
Yeah. Like p***.

36:59.094 --> 37:03.430
You sure you don't want to try
the bung gut? Back up! Back up.

37:03.843 --> 37:05.181
It's our homemade recipe.

37:05.182 --> 37:08.038
Despite the staff's
helpful recommendations,

37:08.039 --> 37:09.670
Kari makes up her own mind.

37:09.671 --> 37:12.484
I think I'm gonna
go with small. Okay.

37:12.485 --> 37:14.616
These came out of a beehive,

37:14.617 --> 37:16.984
so I'm gonna pretend
they taste like honey.

37:18.985 --> 37:21.982
The wax worm...
the larvae of wax moths

37:21.983 --> 37:24.282
that live as parasites
in beehives.

37:24.283 --> 37:25.788
What's your heart rate at?

37:26.513 --> 37:28.363
116.

37:28.625 --> 37:31.641
Oh, my God, she's at 82.9 degrees.

37:31.642 --> 37:34.875
So far, that's a
drop of 13 degrees,

37:34.876 --> 37:36.549
and what's unlucky for Kari

37:36.550 --> 37:39.613
is she's yet to get
through her first course.

37:41.043 --> 37:41.994
Oh!

37:42.835 --> 37:44.110
She did it.

37:44.118 --> 37:46.326
And with the worm
putting up a fight,

37:46.327 --> 37:49.707
Kari's fight-or-flight
response is fully activated.

37:49.708 --> 37:50.155
That's good.

37:50.156 --> 37:52.655
It wiggled.
It wiggled in my throat.

37:52.942 --> 37:54.765
Heart rate... 149.

37:54.766 --> 37:57.595
Temperature is 79 degrees.

37:57.596 --> 37:59.293
I can feel it in my throat.

37:59.357 --> 38:01.507
Is it still moving? Mm-hmm.

38:03.882 --> 38:06.500
There's no doubt
Kari has cold feet,

38:06.501 --> 38:09.147
but the agreement was two courses.

38:09.148 --> 38:13.347
Plus, revenge is a dish
best served with live bugs.

38:13.647 --> 38:16.420
I want to know one thing. Yeah?

38:16.421 --> 38:18.368
Why is it that I am a grown woman

38:18.369 --> 38:20.584
and boys are still trying
to make me eat bugs?

38:20.585 --> 38:22.531
Again, working on the principle

38:22.532 --> 38:25.171
that gross things are
best swallowed small...

38:25.172 --> 38:27.070
Oh, you better eat it.
It's getting away.

38:27.183 --> 38:30.527
...Kari selects the
Chinese brown cricket.

38:30.528 --> 38:32.116
Hey, don't play with your food.

38:32.117 --> 38:33.227
You're like a cat.

38:33.228 --> 38:35.006
You're just playing with your
food till you eat it, huh?

38:35.007 --> 38:37.045
Shut up, both of you!

38:37.495 --> 38:40.342
With Kari on edge
and close to fight,

38:40.343 --> 38:42.395
the cricket's flight is up.

38:43.446 --> 38:44.321
Oh!

38:46.361 --> 38:47.642
Oh! Over this.

38:53.753 --> 38:55.247
Not sure the cricket
was the best choice.

38:55.248 --> 38:56.063
I'll tell you why.

39:00.774 --> 39:02.287
Oh, it's stuck.

39:03.611 --> 39:05.302
You ever get a popcorn shell

39:05.303 --> 39:06.588
stuck in the back of your throat?

39:06.589 --> 39:08.760
I think... I think there's a leg.

39:08.797 --> 39:11.785
I think... I think
there's a leg back there.

39:12.334 --> 39:13.310
Medic, standby.

39:13.311 --> 39:14.913
After a short break

39:14.914 --> 39:17.230
to release the cricket
back into the wild...

39:17.231 --> 39:19.178
Science tastes like vomit.

39:19.179 --> 39:20.977
...Get her heart rate
back under control,

39:20.978 --> 39:22.752
and rein her composure,

39:22.753 --> 39:25.206
Kari is ready to
discuss the results.

39:25.207 --> 39:27.302
Check out here your control.

39:27.303 --> 39:29.382
You started out with
a heart rate of 110,

39:29.383 --> 39:32.094
and your foot temperature
is 96 degrees.

39:32.095 --> 39:33.900
And when you walk into the room,

39:33.901 --> 39:35.742
your heart rate goes up to 130,

39:35.743 --> 39:38.803
and the temperature of
your feet went down to 84.

39:38.804 --> 39:40.550
Well, I think that
graph is pretty clear.

39:40.551 --> 39:43.857
The decline in temperature
in my foot just goes

39:44.871 --> 39:48.204
particularly here when
you eat your first bug...

39:48.205 --> 39:50.623
your heart rate goes to 149.

39:50.624 --> 39:52.588
And when you started
choking on the cricket,

39:52.589 --> 39:53.974
look where your heart rate is.

39:53.975 --> 39:55.257
Oh, my God.

39:55.258 --> 39:58.029
And your temperature
is 78.6 degrees.

39:58.030 --> 39:59.469
So, for Kari and Grant,

39:59.470 --> 40:01.540
the idiom is clearly confirmed.

40:01.541 --> 40:03.384
Their foot temperature dropped

40:03.385 --> 40:06.052
by an astonishing
15 degrees or more.

40:06.053 --> 40:09.184
But Tory's results weren't
nearly as conclusive,

40:09.185 --> 40:11.038
so where does that leave us?

40:11.313 --> 40:13.165
So, you had a small
drop in temperature.

40:13.166 --> 40:15.490
It wasn't quite as
significant as Grant or mine,

40:15.491 --> 40:16.913
but still a drop,

40:16.914 --> 40:18.499
so we're gonna have to
call this one plausible.

40:18.500 --> 40:21.008
Wow, that's cool.
All right, plausible.

40:21.009 --> 40:23.921
Plausible it is.
You can get cold feet.

40:28.559 --> 40:30.034
When poop meets fan,

40:30.035 --> 40:33.935
is it really a complete disaster
for everyone in the room?

40:34.321 --> 40:35.776
In three.

40:35.777 --> 40:39.744
To find out, Jamie, Adam and
their crew of crap catchers...

40:39.745 --> 40:40.563
Two.

40:40.564 --> 40:43.188
...Have gone big... real big.

40:43.189 --> 40:44.101
One.

40:44.709 --> 40:45.660
Ohh!

40:47.609 --> 40:48.359
Ugh!

40:50.650 --> 40:51.724
Nice!

40:51.725 --> 40:52.984
Oh, that was a good one.

40:52.985 --> 40:54.449
Oh, hold on a sec.

40:57.416 --> 41:01.097
Now, that is what you
call poop hitting the fan.

41:01.098 --> 41:04.189
Everyone from the
cameraman to Jamie, Adam,

41:04.190 --> 41:06.439
and every member
of the poo platoon

41:06.440 --> 41:09.101
got at least some
level of coverage.

41:10.389 --> 41:11.842
And I think you'd agree with me

41:11.843 --> 41:14.436
that when it comes to poo
flying around the room,

41:14.437 --> 41:16.525
any poo is bad.

41:17.325 --> 41:18.702
Adam wasn't the only one.

41:18.703 --> 41:20.820
I got it on my beret.
I got it on my shirt.

41:20.821 --> 41:22.338
I even got it on my moustache.

41:22.339 --> 41:25.240
And we had spray ending
up all the way out

41:25.241 --> 41:27.574
to about 40 feet
away from the fan.

41:27.811 --> 41:28.902
That's quite a spray.

41:28.903 --> 41:32.040
I got to say, this is another
in a long line of myths

41:32.041 --> 41:33.260
in which in the small scale,

41:33.261 --> 41:36.044
I didn't think things were
looking too good for the myth,

41:36.045 --> 41:37.235
but in the large scale,

41:37.497 --> 41:39.834
all of a sudden they're
looking pretty darned good.

41:40.533 --> 41:42.800
Yep, under the correct
circumstances,

41:42.801 --> 41:45.934
the myth's catastrophe
criterion has been matched,

41:45.935 --> 41:49.086
and the fat lady is
warming her tonsils.

41:49.709 --> 41:51.815
But before she breaks into song,

41:51.816 --> 41:56.420
Adam and Jamie have still got
two buckets of unused fake poo.

41:56.421 --> 41:58.069
Now, what to do?

41:58.070 --> 41:59.456
That's what I'm talking about.

41:59.457 --> 42:01.828
Yep, it's the
Mythbusters' patented

42:01.829 --> 42:04.019
ramping it up to ridiculous,

42:04.020 --> 42:07.919
and to make sure they deliver
on a suitably super-sized scale,

42:07.920 --> 42:10.094
they're upscaling the fan

42:10.095 --> 42:12.915
and flinging the poop
from all directions.

42:12.916 --> 42:15.828
Oh, yeah. Perfect.

42:15.829 --> 42:16.845
We figure this time around,

42:16.846 --> 42:19.627
we're gonna deliver our poop
from multiple directions.

42:19.890 --> 42:21.201
Are you ready, Adam?

42:21.202 --> 42:22.703
I am ready, sir.

42:23.417 --> 42:25.330
All different directions,

42:25.680 --> 42:27.092
in three,

42:27.580 --> 42:29.904
two, one.

42:42.826 --> 42:46.089
I'm covered with it.
It got all over me from up here.

42:46.090 --> 42:49.001
And with that,
this myth is all over with.

42:49.251 --> 42:50.975
Let's inspect the troops,
shall we?

42:51.250 --> 42:52.719
Spattered, spattered,

42:52.720 --> 42:54.424
oh, spattered, messed up,

42:54.425 --> 42:56.685
spattered, spattered, spattered,

42:56.686 --> 42:58.892
spattered, spattered,
and spattered.

42:58.893 --> 43:00.025
Where does that leave us?

43:00.363 --> 43:02.012
I don't know... covered in poop?

43:02.013 --> 43:04.187
It does. I'd call
this one plausible.

43:04.188 --> 43:06.850
Under the right
circumstances, I agree.

43:15.639 --> 43:18.595
What's that, boy?
I know that was really cool.

43:18.596 --> 43:19.933
And if you want to see it, too,

43:19.934 --> 43:23.114
you can log on to discovery.
Com/mythbusters.

43:23.115 --> 43:24.378
Who's a good boy?

43:24.578 --> 43:34.778
