00:59.532 --> 01:03.534
It has been one year
since we last communed...

01:04.251 --> 01:09.274
One year since you blessed me
with your vision.

01:09.275 --> 01:13.019
I thank you for the gift
you share with us...

01:14.217 --> 01:20.306
For showing us
what the future holds.

01:41.053 --> 01:44.912
Father,
what future did you see?

01:46.732 --> 01:49.207
Father?

01:49.230 --> 01:51.178
What's wrong?

01:52.893 --> 01:56.196
I saw the face of the man

01:56.219 --> 01:58.720
who will kill me.

02:00.404 --> 02:05.025
Sync, corrected by icephoenix

02:25.253 --> 02:27.513
Your little goddess friend
must have told you more.

02:27.525 --> 02:29.531
No, Kuji just said

02:29.555 --> 02:31.563
there was a great journey
that you were to go on.

02:31.585 --> 02:33.769
A great journey, which means
that something is coming

02:33.793 --> 02:35.672
and I want to know about it.

02:35.695 --> 02:37.750
Just accept what will be.

02:37.773 --> 02:40.114
No, Cook,
I can't just accept what will be.

02:40.130 --> 02:42.912
I want to be ready for the future
before it happens.

02:42.936 --> 02:46.367
You're starting to sound like
those crazy stone people.

02:46.391 --> 02:48.841
Stone people?

02:48.865 --> 02:51.110
What, statues?

02:51.133 --> 02:53.939
The Order of the Stone.

02:53.963 --> 02:55.911
Don't you people know anything?

02:55.927 --> 02:59.227
We know when you are trying
to pass rat off as chicken.

02:59.250 --> 03:00.976
Again.

03:04.549 --> 03:08.356
Religious folk. They believe
they have this mystical rock

03:08.376 --> 03:10.716
that will show them the future.

03:10.739 --> 03:12.972
And it's not rat.

03:14.287 --> 03:17.841
But it's not chicken either.

03:17.865 --> 03:20.883
- Best not to ask.
- So do you know where they are,

03:20.907 --> 03:22.269
this Order of the Stone?

03:22.281 --> 03:24.141
I thought you weren't
supposed to tell him anything.

03:24.163 --> 03:26.764
- I haven't.
- A man should never see his future.

03:26.788 --> 03:29.101
Cook, that wasn't my question.

03:30.052 --> 03:32.388
Look, apparently
I'm going on this journey,

03:32.412 --> 03:35.281
a journey that's so important
even a god sat up and took notice.

03:35.304 --> 03:37.933
I need to find out what that is.

03:37.945 --> 03:39.753
- I have.
- So I'll ask you again.

03:39.772 --> 03:42.602
Do you know
where that stone might be?

03:54.802 --> 03:58.031
That stone is somewhere
in this city

03:58.054 --> 04:00.757
and we're going to find it.

04:01.990 --> 04:05.992
Can somebody please tell him
this isn't a good idea.

04:06.016 --> 04:10.563
I agree. Knowing
your own future isn't natural,

04:10.586 --> 04:12.845
whatever your reasons might be.

04:12.868 --> 04:17.010
What if the future sees one of us
injured or worse?

04:17.033 --> 04:19.944
Wouldn't you want to know about it
so we could avoid it?

04:19.966 --> 04:23.944
If it was the future,
we couldn't avoid it.

04:24.742 --> 04:30.944
You could try.
Come on.

04:34.905 --> 04:38.263
Nice.

04:41.769 --> 04:43.612
Father?

05:03.487 --> 05:06.223
I've been thinking about
the vision that you've had.

05:07.127 --> 05:09.604
As have I.

05:09.628 --> 05:12.257
For so long,
we have looked to the stone,

05:12.280 --> 05:15.103
have trusted what it shows us.

05:16.465 --> 05:20.084
But to see my own death...

05:21.736 --> 05:24.836
Can the future be changed?

05:28.670 --> 05:32.451
If this stranger does harm you,

05:32.474 --> 05:35.398
what will happen to the Order?

05:35.415 --> 05:39.195
Brother Farman will take my
place as Grandmaster.

05:40.475 --> 05:44.886
- But I always assumed that I would be--
- Well, then you were wrong.

05:49.245 --> 05:51.077
Such a waste.

05:51.101 --> 05:54.427
Such a waste.
You keep this stone locked away

05:54.451 --> 05:58.539
when it should be shared
amongst us all.

05:58.562 --> 06:01.706
That is why you will never be ready.

07:14.525 --> 07:17.636
- Excuse me. We are--
- Pilgrims.

07:19.991 --> 07:22.692
Yes, pilgrims.

07:23.243 --> 07:25.914
We're on a journey
to find the great stone.

07:25.915 --> 07:27.595
You know how we could do that?

07:27.619 --> 07:29.744
All can see the stone.

07:33.484 --> 07:35.809
Great. How?

07:35.833 --> 07:39.854
You have to petition the great Azdi
to allow you to join the Order.

07:39.865 --> 07:45.967
But prostrating yourself before him,
that's not enough. No. No.

07:47.632 --> 07:51.788
And then you have to study and
meditate to ensure that

07:51.812 --> 07:56.426
your cluttered little mind
can handle the visions from the stone.

07:56.449 --> 07:59.080
And how long does that take?

07:59.103 --> 08:03.152
Blink of an eye, really.
Thirty, maybe forty--

08:03.175 --> 08:05.383
- Days?
- Years.

08:09.182 --> 08:11.307
Well worth the journey,
wasn't it?

08:14.188 --> 08:16.292
There must be a way that
we can get to it.

08:16.315 --> 08:19.971
- There is. He told you.
- No, Gunnar, a quicker way.

08:19.995 --> 08:22.707
Maybe we could steal the stone.

08:22.730 --> 08:25.774
Let me guess.
You came to see the stone.

08:27.523 --> 08:29.315
Now you've realized
what that involves

08:29.338 --> 08:31.757
and you see what a
wasted journey you've had.

08:40.142 --> 08:44.792
Maybe not a complete waste.
Excuse me.

08:54.051 --> 08:56.653
I've often thought,
with his muscles,

08:56.676 --> 08:58.708
your brains and my light fingers,

08:58.731 --> 09:01.419
there isn't a vault in the land
that would stand a chance.

09:01.437 --> 09:04.278
Not forgetting Cook
and his deadly cuisine.

09:04.302 --> 09:06.136
You wouldn't even come close.

09:06.159 --> 09:10.196
- I don't think we're asking you.
- And also, we're just talking.

09:10.219 --> 09:12.384
Hypothetically.
We're not looking for trouble.

09:12.407 --> 09:14.684
Oh, neither am I, but still.
The fact remains,

09:14.707 --> 09:16.352
stealing the stone...

09:17.937 --> 09:20.838
For a start, it isn't in a vault.

09:22.085 --> 09:25.220
It's hidden deep underground

09:25.666 --> 09:29.376
surrounded by deadly traps and pitfalls.

09:30.977 --> 09:34.219
They do say it's the most beautiful stone.

09:34.243 --> 09:37.438
It's heart-shaped and deepest red.

09:37.506 --> 09:41.500
It's in the middle of the most
devious maze ever designed by man.

09:41.524 --> 09:43.570
It's bigger than a city.

09:43.593 --> 09:49.158
Even if you could find a way in,
you'd never find a way out.

09:49.182 --> 09:51.309
I think I could.

09:52.236 --> 09:53.481
Really?

09:53.504 --> 09:55.518
You've heard of the
Maze of Madrigal?

09:55.542 --> 09:57.185
No.

09:57.209 --> 10:00.719
It's a puzzle,
a model created by the Egyptians.

10:00.743 --> 10:04.976
Some of the greatest minds
have spent months trying to solve it.

10:05.516 --> 10:08.720
I did it in three days.

10:10.388 --> 10:12.472
That's not that impressive.

10:12.496 --> 10:13.963
I was nine years old.

10:16.697 --> 10:19.443
Maybe we should talk some more.

10:20.311 --> 10:24.260
I know the only way is the true way:
To join the Order.

10:24.284 --> 10:27.984
You mean to
waste forty years of your life

10:28.001 --> 10:32.586
waiting to see a future that,
after all that time, is no longer there.

10:32.610 --> 10:35.681
Maybe there is more than
one way to see what's coming.

10:36.702 --> 10:40.184
You know that moment
you catch a stranger's eye...

10:40.208 --> 10:45.167
Just for a second,
you see many possible futures.

10:46.530 --> 10:48.245
Sinbad?

10:52.794 --> 10:54.795
You could ignore him.

10:55.781 --> 10:57.846
We could continue
this conversation elsewhere.

10:57.847 --> 10:59.993
Sinbad?

11:00.732 --> 11:03.658
Maybe later?

11:05.537 --> 11:08.417
That's the thing about the future,
isn't it?

11:08.440 --> 11:11.192
- Nobody knows.
- Ahem!

11:18.366 --> 11:20.441
This had better be important.

11:20.465 --> 11:23.069
Yes, it is.

11:23.094 --> 11:26.404
- So this man here, Riff?
- Riff.

11:26.874 --> 11:32.161
He said that if we help him,
he can take us to the stone.

11:33.218 --> 11:37.837
If you help me navigate the labyrinth,
I will get you in.

11:39.011 --> 11:41.113
Why would we need your help?

11:41.136 --> 11:45.239
Because there's only one key that can
open the door to the labyrinth.

11:45.259 --> 11:49.133
That key belongs to
the Grandmaster of the Order...

11:50.554 --> 11:52.449
My beloved father.

12:00.162 --> 12:03.583
So... interested?

12:09.040 --> 12:11.059
Are you sure you want to do this,

12:11.082 --> 12:13.600
go up against your father?

12:13.624 --> 12:16.922
You have no idea how long
I've wanted to see that stone

12:16.933 --> 12:18.757
and how many times
I've begged my father

12:18.781 --> 12:20.888
and how many times he's said,
"No, never."

12:20.912 --> 12:23.141
So, yes, very sure.

12:23.775 --> 12:25.513
Maybe he had good reason.

12:25.536 --> 12:26.908
You help us, we help you,

12:26.931 --> 12:29.605
- everyone gets what they want.
- Exactly.

12:30.720 --> 12:32.836
- What's waiting for us in there?
- Nothing.

12:32.848 --> 12:36.311
Don't lie to me.
You're setting us up. I know it.

12:36.334 --> 12:37.696
- Ten seconds.
- No, please.

12:37.720 --> 12:39.399
That's how long you've got
to tell us the truth

12:39.422 --> 12:41.219
or I'll snap your windpipe
like rice paper.

12:41.236 --> 12:43.160
- I'm telling the truth!
- Four, three, two, one!

12:43.183 --> 12:45.456
Please, no!
I just need your help!

12:48.603 --> 12:50.945
He's telling the truth.

12:51.465 --> 12:53.792
I'm sorry, but we have to be sure.

12:53.816 --> 12:57.127
- We've walked into traps before.
- It's our speciality.

12:58.007 --> 12:59.815
Let's do this.

13:05.793 --> 13:07.896
You enjoyed that, didn't you?

13:37.364 --> 13:41.649
I told you I would keep
my side of the bargain.

13:52.379 --> 13:56.618
Hey. This way.

14:25.060 --> 14:29.381
The markings and the symbols on
the wall reveal the route to the stone.

14:42.253 --> 14:46.433
But choose the wrong path
and only death awaits.

15:05.423 --> 15:07.643
Don't get left behind.

15:22.391 --> 15:24.599
Interesting.

15:24.622 --> 15:30.614
Each corridor has these letters,
but it's in script I've never seen before.

15:30.638 --> 15:32.498
- So what does that mean?
- I don't know.

15:32.522 --> 15:35.745
I just need to find a way to translate.

15:37.790 --> 15:41.187
- I'll work it out.
- I'm sure you will.

15:41.210 --> 15:44.928
And, Anwar, thanks for doing this.
I know it seems like--

15:44.951 --> 15:51.139
We're in one of the world's
biggest puzzles and it's great.

15:52.703 --> 15:55.721
Now... left.

15:55.744 --> 15:58.860
No, no, straight ahead, I think.

16:00.058 --> 16:03.557
Yes.
Straight ahead.

16:17.148 --> 16:19.626
Different every time.

16:19.649 --> 16:22.764
There are letters repeated,
but it should form a logical pattern.

16:22.788 --> 16:24.490
I just need to find it.

16:24.514 --> 16:29.564
Find it? You said you could do this.
You've been leading the way.

16:29.587 --> 16:32.205
I'm close to cracking it, really.

16:32.229 --> 16:35.856
No, no, this is not good enough!
This is not good enough!

16:35.879 --> 16:38.525
Shouting at him isn't going to help.

16:38.548 --> 16:41.695
I'm sorry,
did I interrupt your concentration?

16:41.718 --> 16:45.448
You see,
it appears that we are now lost!

16:45.471 --> 16:48.734
And it's your fault. It's your fault!

16:48.758 --> 16:53.282
Gentlemen, we appear to be lost
down to this idiot's incompetence.

16:53.307 --> 16:55.982
- Don't you see--
- Don't move.

16:56.240 --> 16:58.060
You've stepped on a trap.

17:03.199 --> 17:07.132
- It's pressure sensitive.
- Note the holes in the wall beside him.

17:07.155 --> 17:10.609
The moment you step off,
they'll fire darts at you,

17:10.634 --> 17:11.949
most likely poison darts.

17:11.972 --> 17:14.450
Either way,
it's not going to be pretty.

17:14.473 --> 17:16.874
- Any second now, he's going to panic...
- Oh, god.

17:16.897 --> 17:19.195
And I'm going to have to...

17:27.708 --> 17:30.015
Protect him.

17:37.720 --> 17:40.127
We're now trapped because of him.

17:40.151 --> 17:42.454
You said you could get--
You said--

17:42.478 --> 17:44.336
You boasted that
you could get us through

17:44.359 --> 17:46.889
- and now we are trapped and now we--
- Quiet! Shh! Listen.

17:48.829 --> 17:52.411
Who's here? Who's here?

17:53.154 --> 17:55.126
Show yourselves.

17:56.723 --> 18:00.615
No, don't. No, it's my father.
He can't see me.

18:00.639 --> 18:04.917
Leave him.
It's too dangerous.

18:04.940 --> 18:09.362
This is a sacred place.
It is forbidden to enter.

18:09.385 --> 18:13.260
Without knowledge of the labyrinth,
you will be lost forever.

18:16.790 --> 18:18.516
You.

18:19.843 --> 18:21.732
You are the one.

18:23.141 --> 18:25.677
The assassin who will kill me.

18:26.358 --> 18:28.812
Guards, seize them!

18:31.429 --> 18:33.699
Come with us!

19:00.206 --> 19:02.401
Ah!

19:17.193 --> 19:19.600
I came here to see the stone.

19:19.623 --> 19:22.306
I had no intention of harming you.

19:22.329 --> 19:27.285
I have to do what I can to protect myself,
to protect the Order.

19:27.309 --> 19:30.362
You are too dangerous to set free.

19:31.779 --> 19:34.616
So what,
you imprison me here?

19:35.812 --> 19:39.041
- Not imprison, no.
- I don't understand.

19:43.069 --> 19:48.376
I can see no other way.
My judgement is death.

20:44.448 --> 20:48.517
You wanted to see me?

20:59.725 --> 21:05.341
You stole the key and took outsiders
into the sacred place!

21:06.762 --> 21:10.533
You will be taken to our
monastery in Mescatonia.

21:10.557 --> 21:14.797
Perhaps the brothers there
will succeed where I have failed.

21:14.820 --> 21:17.098
Now leave me.

21:17.885 --> 21:20.492
I must prepare myself.

21:32.016 --> 21:35.245
How is the execution to be done?

21:35.269 --> 21:36.959
Poison.

21:37.452 --> 21:39.730
It's the surest way.

21:44.763 --> 21:47.017
Are you to administer
the poison yourself?

21:47.041 --> 21:49.072
It is my decision.

21:53.290 --> 21:55.075
Let me do it.

21:56.801 --> 21:59.349
Before you send me away.

21:59.897 --> 22:03.913
Let me do this one thing for you
to show that there is hope in me.

22:03.936 --> 22:05.894
No, I cannot.

22:07.784 --> 22:09.170
You're a man of learning.

22:09.193 --> 22:11.861
And if you do this,
then it will change you.

22:11.873 --> 22:16.244
- Let me give the poison.
- Riff.

22:16.537 --> 22:19.691
I'm the one who stole the key.

22:19.714 --> 22:24.299
I'm the one who has brought
all this upon us.

22:24.322 --> 22:30.178
And you're right.
It is time I took responsibility.

22:59.553 --> 23:02.829
You can't do this! No!

23:02.853 --> 23:06.229
You can't kill me when
I've done nothing wrong!

23:06.246 --> 23:09.649
Please! Don't!

23:15.612 --> 23:19.057
Be brave.
Be brave.

24:19.614 --> 24:23.250
I guess we go back to the ship.

24:29.641 --> 24:34.138
No.
This is wrong.

24:36.275 --> 24:39.900
We can't leave his body behind.

24:39.916 --> 24:44.738
We have to give him a proper burial.

24:44.806 --> 24:49.654
That much... we do.

25:20.745 --> 25:24.467
Easy, easy.

25:24.983 --> 25:28.622
It'll take a few minutes
for the drug to wear off.

25:29.702 --> 25:32.139
Ah.

25:32.140 --> 25:34.600
I don't know what you did.

25:35.457 --> 25:39.155
Maybe death would have been
the better option.

25:47.990 --> 25:51.207
I kept my end of the bargain,
now you keep yours.

26:04.335 --> 26:05.909
No.

26:05.932 --> 26:09.290
What? No! Wait!
We had a deal, remember?

26:09.298 --> 26:11.518
I help you, you force my father

26:11.541 --> 26:13.596
to give me the route to the maze.
That's what you said.

26:13.620 --> 26:15.710
I lied.

26:15.733 --> 26:18.166
Well, you used me. Fine.

26:18.624 --> 26:24.463
Fine, you're not going to help me,
then you don't get him.

26:35.534 --> 26:40.642
I don't need you.
I can make my own way to the stone.

26:40.665 --> 26:43.907
I don't need either of you.

26:43.908 --> 26:46.820
Riff! Wait!

26:46.843 --> 26:49.712
Don't try and move.

26:49.990 --> 26:51.676
It is you.

26:55.721 --> 26:58.704
The collar you are wearing
has lethal blades.

26:58.727 --> 27:03.258
As long as you remain within
close distance to this, you stay alive.

27:03.281 --> 27:06.859
If you try and run away,
you will break the magnetic connection.

27:06.883 --> 27:11.343
And if that happens, the blades
will go straight into your neck.

27:11.367 --> 27:14.135
You will die.

27:14.136 --> 27:16.047
Who are you?

27:16.070 --> 27:19.170
Bounty hunter.
Sent to collect.

27:20.074 --> 27:22.306
Sent by who?

27:22.329 --> 27:25.068
Her name's Taryn.

27:27.886 --> 27:29.529
Father?

27:30.618 --> 27:33.430
- Father?
- What?

27:34.968 --> 27:38.698
Your enemies have sent
another to kill you.

27:38.722 --> 27:41.211
She's a bounty hunter named Tiger.

27:41.234 --> 27:45.570
- Now this time, it's not safe for you--
- I have a duty to protect the stone.

27:45.593 --> 27:49.728
Just listen to me, Father.
Please just listen to me!

27:49.751 --> 27:52.278
It is not safe.
Do you understand?

27:52.289 --> 27:55.021
If you stay, they will kill you.

27:55.041 --> 27:58.340
I cannot walk away.

28:00.807 --> 28:02.392
The labyrinth.

28:03.108 --> 28:05.339
Yes, that's the safest place.

28:05.351 --> 28:07.606
Only you know how to
navigate it and bypass its traps.

28:07.629 --> 28:10.130
You must go there.

28:12.068 --> 28:13.477
Yes.

28:14.992 --> 28:17.953
And I will protect you.

28:18.962 --> 28:22.393
Perhaps I have misjudged you.

28:35.934 --> 28:39.879
I'm not going with you.
I'm not going to be Taryn's little prize.

28:39.902 --> 28:42.345
You don't know who you're
dealing with.

28:42.368 --> 28:45.962
Neither do you.

28:53.394 --> 28:55.073
Nice.

29:04.022 --> 29:05.666
Very nice.

29:24.334 --> 29:26.283
I have the advantage.

29:26.306 --> 29:29.500
Really?
Because your dagger says otherwise.

29:32.566 --> 29:35.079
And yet you're looking
in my eyes

29:35.102 --> 29:38.707
and you're thinking about
the girl you met in the bar earlier.

29:39.594 --> 29:43.750
You're remembering
when she smiled at you.

29:43.764 --> 29:46.634
She's here before you.

29:47.760 --> 29:50.481
And the moment is real.

29:52.576 --> 29:54.719
Thank you.

29:57.591 --> 30:00.233
Playtime's over.

30:02.652 --> 30:05.928
- We go now.
- Make me.

30:06.727 --> 30:08.898
You can't, can you?

30:08.899 --> 30:11.316
Because she told you not to.

30:11.340 --> 30:15.057
Taryn told you to take me alive.

30:19.285 --> 30:21.422
How fast are you?

30:21.446 --> 30:23.269
- Why?
- Oh.

30:38.560 --> 30:39.969
What do you think you're doing?

30:39.993 --> 30:42.438
If Riff is going to force his father
to show him the stone,

30:42.462 --> 30:46.415
it means that I have a chance
to find it and see my future.

30:47.337 --> 30:50.213
Do you understand the collar?
If you try and run, you will die.

30:50.237 --> 30:52.304
And you'll have failed your job.

30:52.328 --> 30:56.143
This collar isn't keeping me with you.
It's keeping you with me.

31:02.108 --> 31:04.493
Maybe they moved the body.

31:05.914 --> 31:08.626
Best check these first.

31:34.171 --> 31:36.393
He's still alive.

31:36.416 --> 31:38.908
Gunnar, look.

31:40.107 --> 31:43.336
Of course.

31:43.347 --> 31:44.914
What?

31:44.938 --> 31:46.946
Look.

31:47.967 --> 31:49.359
ARGO?

31:49.383 --> 31:53.175
A-R-G: Anwar, Rina, Gunnar.

31:53.199 --> 31:56.134
- What about the O?
- That's not an O.

31:56.156 --> 31:59.687
It's a drawing of a stone.

31:59.710 --> 32:04.332
Somehow he is still alive and
he's gone after that damned stone.

32:05.853 --> 32:08.993
Taryn wants you alive,
but I don't need you conscious.

32:09.017 --> 32:13.067
Sure, just drag me through
town in full view of everyone.

32:14.922 --> 32:20.577
Then again, if you help me,
I'll submit.

32:20.601 --> 32:23.304
You can complete your job.

32:24.126 --> 32:28.330
I hope whatever Taryn has in store for you
is exceedingly painful.

32:46.471 --> 32:50.008
Stay close and follow my step.

32:50.648 --> 32:52.443
How do we--

32:56.620 --> 32:59.579
How are we going to get in
without a key?

33:08.099 --> 33:11.361
You sure you're going to find
your way through this time?

33:25.783 --> 33:28.144
Quickly.

33:57.672 --> 34:01.028
Father, are we close?

34:01.052 --> 34:03.153
This way.

34:10.618 --> 34:12.649
So where to now?

34:12.672 --> 34:14.533
You said you could do this.

34:14.550 --> 34:18.284
It's the writing. These letters.
It doesn't make sense.

34:18.306 --> 34:22.934
I'm pretty sure I know every
script there is and this--

34:25.498 --> 34:27.512
They're just shapes.

34:29.985 --> 34:33.726
We're supposed to think they're letters.
That's the beauty of it.

34:33.750 --> 34:36.920
Even letter are made up of
lines and angles.

34:43.900 --> 34:45.984
This way.

35:11.438 --> 35:14.634
Don't move.

35:14.658 --> 35:17.147
You've stepped on a trap.

35:18.955 --> 35:20.960
- Quick, give me your sword.
- So you can kill me?

35:22.322 --> 35:24.483
So I can deflect the poison darts.

35:24.507 --> 35:28.348
You're not fast enough.
If you try and run, you'll die.

35:33.492 --> 35:36.569
Stop moving
and give me your sword.

35:41.613 --> 35:43.832
Fine.

35:46.459 --> 35:49.175
If you leave me,
you will die.

35:53.447 --> 35:56.574
You can't just go!

36:23.159 --> 36:28.346
If you have the chance to
neutralize your enemy, you take it.

36:31.090 --> 36:33.650
That's the difference
between you and me.

36:33.651 --> 36:36.240
You think we're enemies.

36:36.264 --> 36:39.493
I think we're just
getting to know each other.

36:44.362 --> 36:47.230
Sinbad!

36:53.970 --> 36:56.206
Lost?

36:58.024 --> 37:00.907
Some nights I, um...

37:02.102 --> 37:05.843
- I think I can hear it calling me.
- Riff.

37:05.867 --> 37:10.577
Promising me visions of
what will be.

37:10.600 --> 37:13.345
Step down.

37:24.065 --> 37:27.780
You said maybe you'd misjudged me.
Well, why not give me the chance?

37:27.804 --> 37:30.627
Because you're not ready.

37:30.650 --> 37:32.728
And you never will be.

37:32.746 --> 37:39.367
For once in your pathetic life,
respect my decision!

37:39.391 --> 37:43.759
For once in yours, respect mine!

37:43.783 --> 37:47.517
The prophecy.
But you're dead.

37:47.541 --> 37:49.079
How?

37:49.103 --> 37:51.846
- He has come to kill me.
- I will protect you.

37:51.870 --> 37:57.636
No. No matter what you think of me,
I am not a killer.

37:57.660 --> 38:02.393
Riff, put the sword down.

38:08.220 --> 38:11.907
Riff!

38:30.177 --> 38:35.813
I understand.
I understand now.

38:42.785 --> 38:47.611
It wasn't my fault.
He made me do it.

38:50.183 --> 38:52.766
He didn't step away.

38:56.204 --> 38:58.482
Doesn't matter, you see,

38:58.505 --> 39:02.015
'cause it's the stone.
That's what matters.

39:02.031 --> 39:04.907
Do you really think it was worth it?

39:04.926 --> 39:08.770
This justifies killing your own father?

39:12.588 --> 39:15.605
We'll see if it's worth it now.

39:16.404 --> 39:18.423
No!

39:53.172 --> 39:59.959
We have to go.
This place isn't for us.

40:16.701 --> 40:19.895
So... what happens now?

40:21.410 --> 40:24.533
Taryn's waiting.

40:30.619 --> 40:33.262
A blood debt overrides all.

40:35.621 --> 40:38.280
I have no business with you.

40:38.303 --> 40:41.308
Won't that cause problems?

40:44.613 --> 40:47.781
I don't think of tomorrow.

40:48.347 --> 40:52.982
Just the moment.

40:53.005 --> 40:58.402
Well, in this moment,
do you need a lift?

41:06.641 --> 41:09.682
Tell me,
what did you see?

41:09.705 --> 41:12.240
When you smashed the stone,
what did you see?

41:12.263 --> 41:14.873
Cook, nothing. It wasn't real.
It was jus a a stone.

41:14.896 --> 41:18.161
Sinbad, tell me.

41:19.804 --> 41:25.029
I can't let myself believe what I saw.

41:26.110 --> 41:27.911
Why?

41:30.212 --> 41:33.890
The stone shattered and in each fragment,
in each shard,

41:33.891 --> 41:38.962
I saw so many futures,
some where I was a king,

41:38.986 --> 41:44.503
some where I was fool,
I was rich, I was poor...

41:46.521 --> 41:49.890
I was in love...

41:49.914 --> 41:53.375
I was heartbroken.

41:55.081 --> 41:57.464
But there was one future
that stood out,

41:57.488 --> 42:00.493
one that shone
brighter than all the others...

42:02.682 --> 42:08.190
An unnatural sky above
a vast decaying city...

42:10.285 --> 42:13.352
and my brother,

42:13.376 --> 42:18.466
alive, in my arms.

42:20.324 --> 42:26.066
I know what you saw...
The land of the dead.

42:27.663 --> 42:30.644
So is it possible?
Can I go there?

42:30.645 --> 42:33.664
I can see him again?

42:34.392 --> 42:38.722
Sinbad, the futures you see...

42:38.734 --> 42:41.110
They're all true.

42:41.134 --> 42:46.852
They're for you to decide.
They're blank, unwritten, waiting.

42:48.401 --> 42:51.242
They're your tomorrow.
