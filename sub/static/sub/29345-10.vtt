WEBVTT

00:00.934 --> 00:03.237
I'll see you at the lake.

00:03.904 --> 00:04.905
(gasps)

00:06.940 --> 00:10.744
ANNOUNCER: AHS 1984.
Wednesdays at 10:00 on FX.

00:12.346 --> 00:13.481
(motors revving)

00:13.514 --> 00:17.118
ANNOUNCER: FX presents Mayans.

00:19.553 --> 00:21.021
- Previously on
"Mayans M.C."...

00:21.055 --> 00:23.023
- The Irish have nowhere
to bring their guns.

00:23.057 --> 00:24.892
I'm sorry to be droppin'
all this shit

00:24.925 --> 00:27.395
in your laps right now but--
- You wanna bring them south.

00:27.428 --> 00:28.529
- Aye.

00:28.562 --> 00:30.531
We have contacts in Tijuana.

00:30.564 --> 00:32.700
- The Vatos Malditos.

00:32.733 --> 00:35.903
- Bad blood with you
and the shot caller?

00:35.936 --> 00:38.372
Palo.
- Something like that.

00:38.406 --> 00:41.275
- I think it's in our best
interest to avoid retaliation.

00:41.309 --> 00:42.576
If Riz had died,

00:42.610 --> 00:43.911
if what happened
to you was permanent,

00:43.944 --> 00:45.713
I wouldn't hesitate
to strike back.

00:45.746 --> 00:47.415
- Forgive me.

00:54.788 --> 00:57.891
- Riz didn't make it.
We're going to war.

01:00.328 --> 01:02.029
- Why is Potter texting you?

01:02.062 --> 01:03.797
- He's threatening
to deport my dad.

01:03.831 --> 01:05.032
- I need to know the truth

01:05.065 --> 01:06.600
about what happened
in the desert--

01:06.634 --> 01:09.137
the rebels, Adelita,
Galindo, Palomo,

01:09.170 --> 01:10.238
all the pieces.

01:10.271 --> 01:12.906
- I can get you information
about Potter.

01:12.940 --> 01:15.576
I know Miguel wants to use it
to save Adelita.

01:15.609 --> 01:17.378
If you want to save your
father, let me know.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.046
The money orders,

01:19.079 --> 01:21.582
they match entries I found
in a household ledger.

01:21.615 --> 01:22.983
Same dates,
same amounts.

01:23.016 --> 01:25.786
- Dita Galindo.
- It's Miguel's mom.

01:25.819 --> 01:29.457
- It wasn't Miguel.
Dita ordered the hit.

01:29.490 --> 01:31.659
- I'm so sorry.

01:37.465 --> 01:40.000
Good morning.
- Morning.

01:41.602 --> 01:42.803
- Pop.

01:43.771 --> 01:44.972
- Thanks.

01:48.276 --> 01:49.943
You sleep at all?

01:49.977 --> 01:51.645
- What do you think?

01:53.013 --> 01:54.047
- Yeah.

02:00.321 --> 02:02.323
- You were right, Angel.

02:03.324 --> 02:05.826
This obsession buried me
nine years ago.

02:07.328 --> 02:08.662
It's doing it again.

02:15.736 --> 02:17.905
I should have let it go.

02:26.547 --> 02:27.948
- What happened nine years ago

02:27.981 --> 02:30.318
should have never landed
on you alone.

02:33.354 --> 02:36.424
I should have been there
with you, EZ.

02:38.592 --> 02:40.027
That night...

02:45.566 --> 02:48.035
I'm fucking sorry, bro.
I should have believed you.

02:50.538 --> 02:51.872
Fucking helped you.

02:54.041 --> 02:55.709
- No.

02:56.410 --> 03:02.716
Your mother's dead...
because of what I did.

03:04.718 --> 03:07.355
My sin.

03:07.388 --> 03:10.190
- It doesn't matter anymore,
Pop.

03:10.224 --> 03:13.894
- Yes, it does.

03:18.131 --> 03:21.869
I'm gonna talk to Dita today...

03:21.902 --> 03:24.372
get the truth.

03:28.809 --> 03:32.012
Why don't you take that?

03:32.045 --> 03:34.882
It's been ringing
all morning.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.720
- Hey.

04:07.748 --> 04:10.584
We lost Riz last night.

04:10.618 --> 04:12.953
- Shit.

04:21.094 --> 04:24.264
- We figure this
shit out together.

04:24.298 --> 04:26.934
Understand?

04:26.967 --> 04:30.804
- Yeah.
- Don't do anything without us.

05:06.340 --> 05:09.610
- * Mother of exiles

05:09.643 --> 05:11.379
* The torch of hope

05:11.412 --> 05:13.881
* In the toss of the tempest

05:13.914 --> 05:16.817
* Threw us Madison's rope

05:16.850 --> 05:20.320
* But the brazen giant

05:20.354 --> 05:22.456
* With limbs astride

05:22.490 --> 05:25.693
* Blocks the golden door

05:25.726 --> 05:29.363
* To the U.S. of Lies

05:29.397 --> 05:33.834
* Damn your huddled masses

05:33.867 --> 05:36.336
* Scrub our floors

05:36.370 --> 05:38.672
* Cut our grasses

05:38.706 --> 05:41.842
* I am a wolf

05:41.875 --> 05:44.378
* A wild cur

05:44.412 --> 05:46.414
* Cut from the pack

05:48.048 --> 05:50.551
* With blood on my fur

05:50.584 --> 05:53.020
* Every howl

05:53.053 --> 05:56.056
* Marks the debt

05:56.089 --> 06:00.861
* 'Cause a beaten dog

06:00.894 --> 06:03.363
* Never forgets

06:11.939 --> 06:14.442
* Never forgets

06:29.156 --> 06:32.760
- Anything you need,
you let us know.

06:32.793 --> 06:34.995
- Thank you so much.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.932
Oh, my God.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.971
- Yeah.
Okay.

06:45.673 --> 06:48.241
- When?

06:48.275 --> 06:50.444
- Hey, everything cool?

06:50.478 --> 06:51.579
- Yeah.

06:51.612 --> 06:55.082
- Stayed at my pop's
last night.

06:55.115 --> 06:56.817
- How's she holding up?

06:56.850 --> 06:58.285
- Rough.

06:58.318 --> 07:01.288
Riz was her only family
this side of the border.

07:06.126 --> 07:09.663
Uh, just talked
to the hospital.

07:09.697 --> 07:12.299
They have to hold on to
the body for a few days.

07:12.332 --> 07:16.604
Autopsy.
Insurance stuff.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.764
- Rough morning.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.298
- Yep.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.168
- Take your time here.

07:48.201 --> 07:50.037
We'll wait for you
at the clubhouse.

07:50.070 --> 07:53.674
- Wait for me?
Why?

07:57.545 --> 07:59.346
Riz is dead.

07:59.379 --> 08:02.683
You know how this shit
is going down.

08:03.817 --> 08:06.153
The Vatos pay.

08:06.186 --> 08:08.622
- Shit is blowing up, Bish.

08:08.656 --> 08:11.659
Other charters caught wind
of your call.

08:11.692 --> 08:14.427
It's not good.
- I don't give a fuck.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.065
This is San Pa's business.

08:19.066 --> 08:21.234
We handle shit our way.

08:21.268 --> 08:24.538
- Bish, we just wanna talk
to Bishop the king.

08:24.572 --> 08:26.707
Make sure he knows
the ramifications

08:26.740 --> 08:29.610
of what Bishop the president
is about to do.

08:43.791 --> 08:45.425
- You all right, Prez?

08:45.458 --> 08:46.526
- Yeah.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.729
- Why are the Kings
still here?

08:50.798 --> 08:52.465
- Paperwork.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.903
You ready for the vote
tomorrow night?

08:55.936 --> 08:57.571
- I'm ready.

09:17.991 --> 09:19.660
- For the groundbreaking?

09:21.128 --> 09:23.797
- Yeah.
Just some notes.

09:27.601 --> 09:30.804
- I'm gonna go
to City Planning,

09:30.838 --> 09:32.640
talk to Ileana.

09:32.673 --> 09:35.575
See what people actually say
at these ceremonies.

09:35.609 --> 09:37.611
- How is Ileana?

09:40.247 --> 09:44.117
Losing her--her house,
her staff.

09:44.151 --> 09:48.421
So much trauma and suffering.

09:48.455 --> 09:50.323
She could probably use
a fresh start.

09:50.357 --> 09:53.627
- No, she's fine.

09:54.962 --> 09:57.631
- I guess you were right.

09:59.166 --> 10:01.635
It all worked out for the best.

10:05.973 --> 10:08.608
- Your mom
has Dr. Luna today,

10:08.642 --> 10:12.445
so I'll have Paco drop her off,
wait until she's done.

10:12.479 --> 10:15.916
- Great.
Thank you.

10:22.355 --> 10:24.457
- I know what's at stake.

10:27.494 --> 10:30.430
But you can't force
my hand on this.

10:30.463 --> 10:33.133
- You're right, carnal.

10:33.166 --> 10:35.803
But you need to know
what's going down.

10:35.836 --> 10:38.171
- Portland and Spokane
have been waiting two years

10:38.205 --> 10:39.840
for the gun business.

10:39.873 --> 10:44.311
They set up buyers
from Vancouver to Montana.

10:44.344 --> 10:48.982
If we blow this VM deal,
they're ready to defect.

10:49.016 --> 10:52.119
- What?
- Split off.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.353
Wear a fringe patch,

10:53.386 --> 10:55.288
take the gun
business themselves.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.224
They're already talking
to Chibs.

10:57.257 --> 10:59.359
- And you know what happens
to an M.C.

10:59.392 --> 11:01.361
if that shit goes down.

11:01.394 --> 11:03.563
Rocks the faith, brother.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.734
Inside and out.

11:06.767 --> 11:09.169
We lose the unity.

11:09.202 --> 11:11.705
We lose everything.

11:16.744 --> 11:18.511
- Fuck.

11:22.349 --> 11:26.353
- Just talk to Palo,
one-on-one.

11:26.386 --> 11:28.221
Hear what he has to say.

11:28.255 --> 11:31.224
He knows he fucked up.

11:35.095 --> 11:37.030
- Good.

11:37.064 --> 11:39.599
Thank you.

11:39.632 --> 11:41.101
- Where?

11:41.134 --> 11:43.236
- Between TJ and Tecate.

11:43.270 --> 11:45.338
Palo's abuelita's.

11:45.372 --> 11:48.208
He's there for a few days.

11:48.241 --> 11:50.710
Guess it's her birthday.

11:54.081 --> 11:56.283
- I'll take Hank.

11:56.316 --> 11:58.518
Don't say anything
to my guys.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.720
Not until I know
what this looks like.

12:00.754 --> 12:02.823
- Of course.

12:05.458 --> 12:07.227
We'll be at Vicky's.

12:07.260 --> 12:09.763
Let us know
when you're back.

12:27.447 --> 12:29.582
That ain't good.

12:29.616 --> 12:31.751
Trying to get Bishop
to change his mind.

12:31.785 --> 12:34.221
Recant the payback.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.655
- It's fucked, bro.

12:35.688 --> 12:37.825
Dondo said Portland's
threatening to split.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.259
- You serious?

12:39.292 --> 12:40.961
- What does that mean?

12:40.994 --> 12:42.462
- It doesn't fucking matter.

12:42.495 --> 12:44.264
- Dude, Portland's
the second biggest charter.

12:44.297 --> 12:45.665
- They wanna bail,
let them.

12:45.698 --> 12:47.935
We're the ones living
in the fucking jungle, man.

12:47.968 --> 12:49.602
Risking our asses every day.

12:49.636 --> 12:51.805
Those coconut-ass norteÃ±os
want shit handed to them?

12:51.839 --> 12:53.606
Fuck that.
- All right, we get it.

12:53.640 --> 12:56.776
- You don't get shit--this
just can't be about the money.

12:56.810 --> 12:59.612
I had that life, and I ain't
gonna live it again.

12:59.646 --> 13:01.781
This shit happened
for a reason.

13:01.815 --> 13:04.484
The next right thing
is an eye for an eye.

13:04.517 --> 13:06.686
Think about that, boy scout,

13:06.719 --> 13:09.256
Think about what this means
and why you want it.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.924
And if the reason
ain't something

13:10.958 --> 13:12.259
that you can feel in here,

13:12.292 --> 13:14.194
then do yourself a favor.

13:14.227 --> 13:16.796
Move the fuck on.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.068
Get the fuck out of my way!

13:34.681 --> 13:36.549
- I'm so sorry.
- You okay, Chucky?

13:36.583 --> 13:38.218
- Oh, I should have been
more alert.

13:38.251 --> 13:40.387
Always in the way.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.022
Don't be in the way!

13:42.055 --> 13:43.957
Be the ball, Chucky.

13:43.991 --> 13:45.993
Stay in your lane,
stay in your lane.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.127
Always be the ball.

14:09.216 --> 14:11.851
- Hey, brother.

14:11.885 --> 14:14.354
I'm sorry.

14:17.891 --> 14:19.726
- Come on.

14:23.630 --> 14:25.899
- It's crazy.

14:25.933 --> 14:28.068
Crazy couple of days.

14:28.101 --> 14:30.070
- Crazy's the easy part.

14:30.103 --> 14:33.740
It's what happens after crazy
that fucks you up.

14:38.445 --> 14:40.914
- Hey.
You moving offices?

14:42.449 --> 14:44.884
- I took another job.

14:44.918 --> 14:46.619
- What?

14:46.653 --> 14:48.221
- In San Diego.

14:48.255 --> 14:50.623
To be closer to my sister.

14:51.992 --> 14:54.561
- As a city planner?

14:54.594 --> 14:56.763
- Housing authority.

14:56.796 --> 14:59.599
- That's not what you do.

15:05.338 --> 15:07.407
Ileana.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.943
Did someone force you
to take this?

15:09.977 --> 15:12.212
- It was the right move, Emily.
- No, no, no.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.280
You don't have to do this.
I--

15:13.313 --> 15:15.415
- It's too late.
It's done.

15:15.448 --> 15:18.418
You and your husband
got what you wanted.

15:18.451 --> 15:19.719
- What?

15:19.752 --> 15:21.654
What did Miguel do?
- Really?

15:21.688 --> 15:26.026
Jesus Christ, just leave me
and my family alone.

15:38.138 --> 15:41.508
- Hey.
- Thank you for coming.

15:49.382 --> 15:52.019
- Everything okay last night?

15:52.052 --> 15:54.787
Dropping you off?

15:54.821 --> 15:57.124
- Yeah, it was fine.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.228
Is Felipe doing all right?

16:02.729 --> 16:05.198
- Um, I don't know.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.975
- The information on Potter.

16:19.546 --> 16:23.216
She was a witness Potter
was involved with.

16:23.250 --> 16:25.785
They had a kid.

16:25.818 --> 16:30.323
I wrote it down,
everything Miguel told me,

16:30.357 --> 16:32.792
and it is enough
to knock Potter

16:32.825 --> 16:36.163
a few rungs down the ladder,
and at the very least,

16:36.196 --> 16:37.530
declaw him.

16:37.564 --> 16:39.532
- Jesus.

16:39.566 --> 16:44.871
- EZ, promise me nothing
happens to Miguel.

16:51.544 --> 16:53.580
- I--I promise.

16:55.582 --> 16:58.351
If we use it,
nothing happens to Miguel.

16:58.385 --> 17:00.687
- Thank you.

17:08.561 --> 17:10.497
- Where'd Galindo
get this shit?

17:10.530 --> 17:13.233
- Palomo.

17:18.805 --> 17:21.908
- To use against Potter
to get Adelita back.

17:26.879 --> 17:29.216
Why'd Emily give it to you?

17:37.790 --> 17:41.294
- I got one of Potter's
texts last night.

17:41.328 --> 17:43.296
Emily saw my reaction.

17:48.968 --> 17:51.338
I told her Potter
was blackmailing us.

17:53.640 --> 17:56.309
Using Pops as leverage.

17:56.343 --> 17:59.579
She gave me this and said
I could use it to free Pop

17:59.612 --> 18:02.415
if I promised not
to hurt Miguel.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.424
- We use it to free Pop,

18:11.458 --> 18:13.960
Galindo won't be able
to use it for Adelita.

18:19.999 --> 18:21.834
It's your call, Angel.
- Fuck no.

18:21.868 --> 18:23.303
- Yes, it is.

18:28.308 --> 18:32.679
I know how you feel
about Adelita,

18:32.712 --> 18:35.215
how much you're gonna
love that kid.

18:42.489 --> 18:46.859
Just say the word, hermano,
and I'll shred all of this.

18:46.893 --> 18:48.928
We'll let Galindo play it out,

18:48.961 --> 18:51.464
use it to get Adelita back.

18:51.498 --> 18:56.703
But I had to bring this to you,
give you the choice.

18:56.736 --> 18:59.706
No more secrets.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.684
- I'm gonna go check on Pop.

19:13.052 --> 19:15.922
Let me know what you wanna do.

19:32.372 --> 19:34.707
- Call Potter.

19:39.712 --> 19:42.181
Set a meeting.

19:42.215 --> 19:44.217
- Yeah?

19:47.687 --> 19:49.889
Okay.

20:09.742 --> 20:13.580
I trust all went well
with lioness and cub.

20:13.613 --> 20:15.582
- No complications.

20:15.615 --> 20:17.450
- Hmm.

20:17.484 --> 20:20.420
The circle of life continues.

20:24.090 --> 20:26.192
Have we drawn blood?
- Yes.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.694
If there's a match,
we should know

20:27.727 --> 20:29.396
by end of day tomorrow.
- Good.

20:29.429 --> 20:34.267
Then we move Luisa Espina
into the interrogation wing.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.211
-  Hola, amor .

21:37.163 --> 21:38.831
- Marisol.

21:43.169 --> 21:45.372
Did you have her killed?

21:47.807 --> 21:51.844
Did you hire someone
to kill both of us?

21:57.083 --> 22:00.520
- Miguel had just made
his first development deal.

22:03.423 --> 22:07.193
Jose and I came out
to celebrate.

22:09.228 --> 22:11.998
We went to the local
festival.

22:13.199 --> 22:15.702
- You saw Marisol and me.

22:21.340 --> 22:24.511
Dita, why?

22:24.544 --> 22:28.381
Almost 20 years had passed.

22:30.717 --> 22:34.120
- It was mostly about Miguel.

22:35.287 --> 22:38.290
I couldn't lose him, too.

22:40.527 --> 22:44.096
And now he was
in your backyard.

22:44.130 --> 22:47.233
I knew you suspected
he was your son.

22:48.535 --> 22:51.404
I was afraid you would try
to connect with him,

22:51.438 --> 22:55.408
but when I saw you
with Isabel,

22:55.442 --> 22:59.278
even after all those years,
I hated it.

22:59.311 --> 23:02.882
I could see how much
you loved her.

23:02.915 --> 23:05.485
- Jesus Christ.

23:26.606 --> 23:31.010
- There was nothing to share.
Nothing.

23:31.978 --> 23:34.246
That part of my life was over.

23:55.301 --> 23:59.071
- It's time for me to go,
Felipe.

23:59.105 --> 24:02.709
Not by an act of nature.

24:03.643 --> 24:06.445
That failed.

24:08.781 --> 24:11.150
It has to be you.

25:24.891 --> 25:26.726
- Ride okay?

25:28.628 --> 25:30.196
- Yeah.

25:41.941 --> 25:45.612
- Turns 90 tomorrow
and still works like she's 25.

25:48.047 --> 25:50.049
- Talk inside?

25:51.584 --> 25:53.052
- Yeah.

26:21.113 --> 26:22.649
- Sure you wanna do this?

26:22.682 --> 26:25.517
We don't have to do this if--
- Yeah, we do.

26:27.186 --> 26:29.488
- Haven't told me why.

26:33.092 --> 26:35.294
After that day in the desert,

26:35.327 --> 26:38.264
when Adelita sent me away--

26:38.297 --> 26:41.500
sent us all away...

26:41.533 --> 26:44.904
I don't know, man,
it fuckin'...

26:44.937 --> 26:47.273
split me in half, you know?

26:49.208 --> 26:51.577
Like something changed.

26:51.610 --> 26:54.513
I finally saw who she was.

26:55.648 --> 26:58.217
A little bit of who I could be.

27:00.319 --> 27:04.456
So now any time I feel lost...

27:06.125 --> 27:07.426
Fucked up, sad and shit,

27:07.459 --> 27:10.196
I ask myself what
she would do...

27:11.497 --> 27:13.833
And what she would say.

27:17.403 --> 27:19.706
- She'd tell you to help Pop.

27:22.308 --> 27:25.477
- Yeah, and she'd be
fucking proud of me.

27:28.681 --> 27:31.684
And then there's also
the real possibility that

27:31.718 --> 27:33.686
if we use that shit
to free her,

27:33.720 --> 27:36.689
she would fucking
send us home again.

27:42.194 --> 27:44.563
- I'm proud of you, Angel.

27:45.431 --> 27:48.735
- Tch.
Shut up.

27:55.374 --> 27:58.277
Can't we just shoot this guy
in the fucking face?

28:00.379 --> 28:02.882
- That's plan B.

28:09.221 --> 28:12.324
- The gentlemen bikers.

28:12.358 --> 28:15.327
Fate continues to steer,

28:15.361 --> 28:18.697
and all roads lead back to us.

28:19.866 --> 28:22.935
I trust the contents
will be worth my commute.

28:22.969 --> 28:24.170
- Yeah.

28:24.203 --> 28:27.206
Everything about
your favorite Latina

28:27.239 --> 28:29.341
and all the dirty
little secrets.

28:46.993 --> 28:49.661
- Remember her?

28:51.297 --> 28:53.099
- What is this?

28:53.132 --> 28:55.167
- It's fate, motherfucker.

28:56.068 --> 28:58.771
- We know she was a witness
for prosecution.

28:58.805 --> 29:01.640
Capital murder case
that you won.

29:01.673 --> 29:05.277
We also know you were
sleeping with her.

29:07.513 --> 29:09.982
- Then this shit happened.

29:13.585 --> 29:16.255
- We send this to your
superiors in the DOJ,

29:16.288 --> 29:18.390
I'm pretty sure
knocking someone up

29:18.424 --> 29:20.993
is considered manipulating
a witness.

29:23.195 --> 29:24.430
- Your career is fucked.

29:24.463 --> 29:27.299
- Or maybe we just
visit Mama.

29:27.333 --> 29:28.968
She's pretty hot.

29:30.769 --> 29:33.072
I'm sure it'd be worth
the commute.

29:37.043 --> 29:38.610
- Hey--

29:38.644 --> 29:39.946
- Sir!

29:41.047 --> 29:43.682
- Back...the fuck up.

29:43.715 --> 29:45.684
Back up.

29:45.717 --> 29:47.786
- Sir,
is everything all right?

29:51.657 --> 29:53.759
- Just a momentary
flash of passion,

29:53.792 --> 29:56.262
Agent Smithers,
stand--stand down.

29:56.295 --> 29:58.464
Everything's fine.

30:24.423 --> 30:26.658
I'm waiting.

30:26.692 --> 30:30.562
- You're gonna drive back
to your fifth ring of hell

30:30.596 --> 30:34.133
and you're gonna throw out
anything you have

30:34.166 --> 30:36.535
on Ignacio Cortina.

30:37.703 --> 30:41.207
He didn't exist.
You understand?

30:41.240 --> 30:43.575
Then you're gonna enter Felipe
and Marisol Reyes

30:43.609 --> 30:49.315
into the CIS database
and make them US citizens.

30:49.348 --> 30:51.650
You got 24 hours.

30:51.683 --> 30:54.653
- Even I can't restructure
the immigration process--

30:54.686 --> 30:58.357
- If there is not a letter
from Immigration Services

30:58.390 --> 31:01.427
on my old man's doorstep
by tomorrow night,

31:01.460 --> 31:04.596
this shit lands
on the D.A.G.'s desk.

31:04.630 --> 31:08.200
- And you can hang on to those.

31:08.234 --> 31:11.270
We have the originals.

31:15.107 --> 31:18.744
- You've fucked with me
and my family enough.

31:20.079 --> 31:22.514
It's over.

31:55.447 --> 31:56.715
Thank you, Grandmother.

31:56.748 --> 31:58.050
Happy birthday.

31:58.084 --> 31:59.451
-  Bring the offer
to the Kings.

31:59.485 --> 32:02.488
Figure out how
to compensate my guys.

32:02.521 --> 32:05.824
- It's the best thing
for both clubs.

32:05.857 --> 32:08.094
- Yeah.

32:09.495 --> 32:11.563
- I'll reach out to Charming.

32:11.597 --> 32:14.066
Let Chibs know
we're moving ahead.

32:23.675 --> 32:25.177
- So how'd it go?

32:25.211 --> 32:29.481
- Uh, I played it
the way I had to.

32:29.515 --> 32:31.183
- Yeah.

32:32.651 --> 32:35.654
Kings gave you no choice.

32:38.557 --> 32:42.694
- You talked to Grandma?
- Yeah.

32:42.728 --> 32:45.497
She's excited about
her party tomorrow.

33:10.889 --> 33:12.024
- Pop?

33:12.058 --> 33:13.825
- Hey.

33:14.660 --> 33:15.994
- You okay?

33:16.028 --> 33:18.597
- Yeah.
Sit down, please.

33:28.374 --> 33:31.177
- What's going on?

33:31.210 --> 33:32.978
- I talked to Dita.

33:33.011 --> 33:35.147
She confessed.

33:35.181 --> 33:36.715
- Fuck.

33:37.783 --> 33:40.752
She knew it'd come down
to this.

33:40.786 --> 33:42.521
- Come down to what?

33:42.554 --> 33:44.956
- She wants to die, son.

33:46.392 --> 33:48.860
Thinks the fire didn't kill her

33:48.894 --> 33:50.762
because that's what
I'm supposed to do.

33:50.796 --> 33:53.265
- She's fucking crazy.

33:53.299 --> 33:54.733
- Probably.

33:54.766 --> 33:57.436
- You can't do it, Pop.

33:57.469 --> 34:02.308
- I've been trying to hide from
Ignacio Cortina for 30 years.

34:04.743 --> 34:08.714
But the things he did,
the violence,

34:08.747 --> 34:10.916
the betrayal...

34:13.552 --> 34:17.156
That's truth that
couldn't be ignored.

34:18.990 --> 34:22.761
So Felipe Reyes
has to pay the price.

34:22.794 --> 34:25.964
- Y--you're not making
any sense.

34:39.111 --> 34:43.915
Go with your brother.
Do whatever you need to do.

34:43.949 --> 34:47.018
Let me deal with the sins
of the past.

34:48.187 --> 34:49.688
- No.

34:51.457 --> 34:53.925
- Don't argue with me.

34:53.959 --> 34:57.563
I told you,
I can take care of this.

34:57.596 --> 34:59.165
Now go.

34:59.198 --> 35:01.300
- We're not going.
- Stop it!

35:02.534 --> 35:05.103
Don't disrespect me.

35:06.305 --> 35:08.207
My decision.

35:09.541 --> 35:11.510
I'll do what I need to do.

35:12.311 --> 35:16.748
Now get the fuck out of here.
Leave me to it.

35:16.782 --> 35:18.317
Both of you.

35:45.711 --> 35:48.180
- * Your breath is sweet

35:48.214 --> 35:52.651
* Your eyes are like
two jewels in the sky *

35:52.684 --> 35:55.687
- Everything okay with Galindo?

35:57.356 --> 35:59.024
- I wasn't with Galindo.

35:59.057 --> 36:00.726
We were on the other side.

36:00.759 --> 36:02.160
I sat down with Palo.
- I fucking knew it!

36:02.194 --> 36:03.829
You caved to the--
- You interrupt me again,

36:03.862 --> 36:07.366
I'm gonna gouge your
fucking eyes out myself.

36:07.399 --> 36:11.036
- * Your loyalty
is not to me but *

36:11.069 --> 36:13.339
- Let Ramos and Canche
know we're back.

36:13.372 --> 36:15.173
Table.
Now.

36:25.717 --> 36:28.254
- MamÃ¡, permiso ?

38:21.500 --> 38:23.168
-  Yes.

39:11.216 --> 39:12.884
Thank you.

39:16.422 --> 39:20.225
Good night.

39:20.258 --> 39:22.293
- Te quiero, Miguel.

39:25.731 --> 39:27.933
- Te quiero, Mama.

39:38.977 --> 39:41.079
- It's not how I planned it.

39:43.248 --> 39:45.083
But the shot caller crown...

39:46.485 --> 39:49.054
It shines a light
on the choices I make.

39:51.156 --> 39:53.291
So I navigate
the best way I can.

39:54.893 --> 39:56.628
I know you hate
doing it this way.

39:58.263 --> 40:00.265
Feels like you're betraying
the patch.

40:01.767 --> 40:03.268
But we'll figure it out.

40:05.804 --> 40:07.105
I promise you that.

40:11.610 --> 40:15.280
Ramos and Canche are out there,
waiting.

40:16.347 --> 40:17.516
Please...

40:20.652 --> 40:23.088
Play it smart.

40:23.121 --> 40:24.690
Don't blow shit up.

40:37.135 --> 40:39.237
- You motherfuckers
got what you wanted?

40:39.270 --> 40:40.438
We take the bullet,

40:40.472 --> 40:41.807
the rest of the M.C.
take the prizes?

40:41.840 --> 40:44.109
Fuck you!
Fuck you, huh?

40:44.142 --> 40:45.611
Betrayal!
Fuck you!

40:45.644 --> 40:47.278
- Coco!

40:47.312 --> 40:50.281
- Fuck you, homie!
Straight up fuck you!

40:54.620 --> 40:56.788
- Stay in your lane,
stay in your lane.

40:56.822 --> 40:59.390
Hey.
Hey, Chucky, wait.

41:00.291 --> 41:03.328
Hey...hey, I'm sorry about
what happened.

41:03.361 --> 41:06.297
- No, that's okay.
- No, it wasn't.

41:06.331 --> 41:07.666
I fucking love you, Chucky.

41:13.471 --> 41:15.306
We all do.

41:25.350 --> 41:27.653
- You made the right call,
carnal .

41:27.686 --> 41:30.656
- Yeah, I did.

41:30.689 --> 41:33.224
- Your crew will come
around.

41:40.666 --> 41:42.233
- Safe trip.

41:42.267 --> 41:45.236
- Yeah, thanks, brother.

41:45.270 --> 41:46.905
- You sure about this, jefe ?

41:49.741 --> 41:51.543
- Nope.

43:13.191 --> 43:15.360
- Si, senora.

44:01.472 --> 44:04.876
You gotta be fucking
kidding me.

44:05.677 --> 44:09.180
- That's how we feel about
the Santo Padre Agra Park.

44:09.214 --> 44:10.816
It's not just about

44:10.849 --> 44:14.519
revitalizing
the valley's agriculture.

44:14.552 --> 44:19.691
It is about
reinvigorating hope.

44:26.865 --> 44:29.735
Thank you.

44:46.051 --> 44:48.219
- Congratulations.

44:48.253 --> 44:49.254
- Thank you, Mayor.

44:51.890 --> 44:53.725
- Thank you.

45:25.156 --> 45:27.425
- Hey.

45:27.458 --> 45:29.761
You talk to Pop?
- I called.

45:29.795 --> 45:30.896
No answer.

45:33.631 --> 45:36.401
Let's head to the shop.
- Yeah.

45:37.102 --> 45:38.636
- Hey-o.

45:41.973 --> 45:43.875
From a lovely woman.

45:43.909 --> 45:48.146
Older, soft-spoken,
very nice hair.

46:02.093 --> 46:03.929
- Thanks, Chucky.

46:29.720 --> 46:31.556
Hmm?

46:32.057 --> 46:34.359
Oh, yes.

46:34.392 --> 46:36.627
Si.
Uh--uh, yes.

46:39.831 --> 46:42.934
Thank you.

46:42.968 --> 46:44.469
Yes?

46:44.502 --> 46:47.305
- I got DNA results back
from Cali Corrections.

46:47.338 --> 46:49.207
- Mm-hmm.

46:49.240 --> 46:52.110
There was a match.
I double checked.

46:52.143 --> 46:54.846
It's his kid.

47:04.222 --> 47:08.059
She's awake if you wanna
talk to her.

47:15.566 --> 47:18.669
- No, that--that won't
be necessary.

47:20.271 --> 47:23.674
After the meal is over...

47:27.012 --> 47:29.047
Take the baby.

48:00.645 --> 48:03.681
- What are we doing here?

48:03.714 --> 48:06.084
- I know this
is difficult for you

48:06.117 --> 48:08.053
but it's the right thing.

48:08.086 --> 48:10.421
- No, it's not.

48:10.455 --> 48:12.157
Psychotic.

48:13.724 --> 48:15.626
I'm not gonna kill you,
Dita.

48:15.660 --> 48:17.362
I can't.
- I know.

48:17.395 --> 48:19.130
I realized that yesterday.

48:25.770 --> 48:28.606
- What are they doing here?
- I asked them to come.

48:28.639 --> 48:30.908
- The fuck did you do?

48:36.281 --> 48:39.784
Nothing's gonna happen here.
Go back to your bikes.

48:42.020 --> 48:43.488
EZ.

48:43.521 --> 48:45.823
- The fuck do you want
from us?

48:45.856 --> 48:47.258
- Karma.

48:47.292 --> 48:52.497
One of you Reyes men has
to help me right a wrong today.

48:52.530 --> 48:54.265
A mother for a mother.

48:54.299 --> 48:55.633
- Jesus.

48:55.666 --> 48:57.435
- I left notes
for the people I love.

48:57.468 --> 48:59.104
They'll think it's a suicide.

48:59.937 --> 49:02.507
No blame will fall on anyone.

49:04.475 --> 49:07.645
- I'll do it.
- No.

49:07.678 --> 49:09.580
- She's got a can full of gas.
She wants to burn.

49:09.614 --> 49:12.183
- I'll do it.
- Ignacio could.

49:13.651 --> 49:15.786
Felipe cannot.

49:17.855 --> 49:20.825
It's okay, mi amor .
- He's not your love.

49:30.568 --> 49:33.971
- I was the one
that pulled this thread.

49:34.005 --> 49:36.674
I have to end this.

49:36.707 --> 49:39.844
- EZ, this is not you.

49:41.012 --> 49:42.647
- Yeah, Pop.

49:44.849 --> 49:46.684
It is.

49:54.192 --> 49:56.761
Take him to the truck.

49:58.696 --> 50:00.865
- Come on, Pop.

50:25.456 --> 50:27.525
I'm deeply sorry--

50:27.558 --> 50:30.928
- This isn't about you
or your fucking karma.

50:34.232 --> 50:36.134
You destroyed my family.

51:22.113 --> 51:23.614
Amen.

51:40.531 --> 51:43.168
- Look at me.

51:46.637 --> 51:48.773
Look at me.

54:24.995 --> 54:26.263
- He's definitely made things

54:26.297 --> 54:28.299
a little more interesting
around here.

54:29.834 --> 54:31.669
- Had a rocky start,

54:31.702 --> 54:33.471
but finished strong.

54:34.505 --> 54:37.274
That's not a comment
on sponsorship.

54:37.308 --> 54:38.609
- Yeah, it is.

54:45.650 --> 54:48.285
- Anyone else?

54:48.319 --> 54:50.988
Pros or cons?

54:54.625 --> 54:57.127
- I didn't want this for him.

54:58.329 --> 55:00.498
That's why I was
a shitty sponsor.

55:01.198 --> 55:04.268
EZ was supposed to be the one
who got the fuck out.

55:04.301 --> 55:08.138
Fuck, man.
He had it all.

55:12.410 --> 55:13.544
But now...

55:14.812 --> 55:16.514
He belongs to us.

55:18.749 --> 55:21.419
This family.

55:22.587 --> 55:25.956
We need him.

55:25.990 --> 55:29.159
I need him.

55:33.864 --> 55:35.500
- Ezekiel Reyes...

55:38.335 --> 55:41.672
Has he earned the right
to carry the Macuahuitl

55:41.706 --> 55:45.943
and take a seat at
la mesa del guerrero ?

56:01.726 --> 56:03.828
- Come on.

56:03.861 --> 56:06.631
- What happened?

56:09.467 --> 56:12.570
- Sorry, bro.

56:49.907 --> 56:52.477
- Take off the kutte.

57:01.619 --> 57:04.288
- On the table.

57:23.140 --> 57:25.710
- Congratulations, Ezekial.

57:27.311 --> 57:29.480
Welcome to the tribe.

58:03.514 --> 58:05.650
- Sew that on.

58:05.683 --> 58:08.986
We got a party to go to.

58:45.890 --> 58:49.026
- We good?

58:49.059 --> 58:52.029
- Yeah.

58:52.062 --> 58:55.532
- This is who we are now, bro.

58:55.566 --> 58:59.103
You understand that?
- I do.

59:00.237 --> 59:03.073
- It's not what
I wanted for you.

59:04.575 --> 59:07.211
There's no one else
I'd rather have by my side.

59:07.244 --> 59:10.014
- I love you, Angel.

59:10.047 --> 59:13.050
Shut up, Ezekiel.

59:54.992 --> 59:56.761
- They fucking love me!

59:56.794 --> 59:59.764
- Got the sheriffs looking
for the SUV.

59:59.797 --> 1:00:02.099
- She didn't say anything?
- No, sir.

1:00:02.132 --> 1:00:04.301
I was gone, like, 20 seconds.

1:00:04.334 --> 1:00:05.770
I didn't even know
she could drive.

1:00:05.803 --> 1:00:10.775
- Miguel, she left us a letter.

1:00:17.281 --> 1:00:21.285
- * Never can a man
get lost *

1:00:21.318 --> 1:00:25.322
* Seeking out
a higher grade *

1:00:25.355 --> 1:00:27.792
* Marching at an order

1:00:27.825 --> 1:00:34.264
* Given by another to behave

1:00:34.298 --> 1:00:37.034
* And never can a man
be seen *

1:00:38.535 --> 1:00:42.873
- * Hidin' in
the willow tree *

1:00:42.907 --> 1:00:45.142
* The pulling
at the branches *

1:00:45.175 --> 1:00:47.311
* Always keeping

1:00:47.344 --> 1:00:50.380
* One eye on the scene

1:00:53.017 --> 1:00:54.985
- Give them a few minutes,

1:00:55.019 --> 1:00:57.354
then pull them away.

1:00:57.387 --> 1:00:59.656
I'll call the sheriffs.

1:01:02.192 --> 1:01:06.130
- * The truth kept hidden
for a moment *

1:01:06.163 --> 1:01:09.900
* My brothers of thunder

1:01:09.934 --> 1:01:13.170
* My sisters of steel

1:01:15.940 --> 1:01:19.676
* Teach me the ways
of the broken *

1:01:19.710 --> 1:01:23.513
* 'Cause together
we run *

1:01:23.547 --> 1:01:29.019
* In pieces we heal

1:01:29.053 --> 1:01:32.089
* Heal

1:01:36.260 --> 1:01:37.762
- What is it?

1:01:41.098 --> 1:01:43.600
- Tell Paco it's time.

1:01:50.808 --> 1:01:56.413
- * Heal

1:01:59.449 --> 1:02:03.854
* At every corner
hanging heads *

1:02:03.888 --> 1:02:08.025
* The neighborhood smells
of death *

1:02:08.058 --> 1:02:12.262
* Leaving just a street light
only witness *

1:02:12.296 --> 1:02:16.901
* To the killing hand of man

1:02:16.934 --> 1:02:20.737
* And never can a man
stay then *

1:02:20.771 --> 1:02:25.943
* If the spirit
isn't dead with him *

1:02:27.677 --> 1:02:30.647
* You'll find him in the
garden digging holes *

1:02:30.680 --> 1:02:34.084
* Like an angry little kid

1:02:36.153 --> 1:02:39.556
* In a silent house

1:02:39.589 --> 1:02:45.229
* Where Adam lost Eve

1:02:45.262 --> 1:02:48.565
* The truth kept hidden
for a moment *

1:02:48.598 --> 1:02:53.003
* My brothers
of thunder *

1:02:53.037 --> 1:02:56.140
* My sisters of steel

1:02:58.608 --> 1:03:01.946
* Teach me the ways
of the broken *

1:03:01.979 --> 1:03:05.782
* 'Cause together
we run *

1:03:05.816 --> 1:03:11.355
* In pieces we heal

1:03:11.388 --> 1:03:15.525
* Heal

1:03:15.559 --> 1:03:21.298
* Heal

1:03:23.533 --> 1:03:28.472
* In pieces we heal

1:03:28.505 --> 1:03:33.310
* Heal

1:03:33.343 --> 1:03:38.515
* Heal

1:03:41.751 --> 1:03:46.390
* Never can a man get lost

1:03:46.423 --> 1:03:50.961
* Seeking out a higher grade

1:03:50.995 --> 1:03:54.498
* Heal

1:04:04.374 --> 1:04:06.010
- No--no!

1:05:05.502 --> 1:05:07.237
- I don't see Palo.

1:05:07.271 --> 1:05:09.439
- Find him.

1:05:09.473 --> 1:05:11.408
- Yeah.

1:05:11.441 --> 1:05:13.510
- On it.

1:05:32.262 --> 1:05:33.597
- Yeah?

1:05:33.630 --> 1:05:36.133
- Congratulations, Papa.

1:05:37.534 --> 1:05:40.604
Your son was born yesterday.

1:05:40.637 --> 1:05:42.672
Healthy and full of life.

1:05:42.706 --> 1:05:44.108
- You fucking with me?

1:05:44.141 --> 1:05:47.711
- On the contrary, Angel.
I'm commiserating.

1:05:49.813 --> 1:05:51.815
We share a common bond now.

1:05:53.717 --> 1:05:55.552
We both know the...

1:05:56.820 --> 1:06:01.291
Unbearable loneliness of
losing the woman we love.

1:06:01.858 --> 1:06:06.330
And we both feel the primal,

1:06:06.363 --> 1:06:08.965
familial pain...

1:06:12.502 --> 1:06:17.741
Every time we realize
that our sons...

1:06:19.743 --> 1:06:22.646
Will never know who we are.

1:06:25.582 --> 1:06:27.751
Welcome to the tribe.

1:06:43.733 --> 1:06:45.502
- Hey, over here!

1:06:45.535 --> 1:06:47.804
Inside.

1:06:51.608 --> 1:06:53.543
- Did you find Palo?

1:06:55.045 --> 1:06:56.480
- No.

1:06:56.513 --> 1:06:59.049
Found him.

1:07:03.387 --> 1:07:06.022
- Fuck me.

1:08:11.655 --> 1:08:14.324
(gasps, breathing shakily)

1:08:14.358 --> 1:08:16.126
(footsteps)

1:08:19.329 --> 1:08:21.165
(metal scraping)

1:08:30.807 --> 1:08:33.177
ANNOUNCER: AHS 1984.

1:08:33.210 --> 1:08:36.480
All new,

1:08:37.814 --> 1:08:39.616
WOMAN: Thank you
for joining the focus group.

1:08:39.649 --> 1:08:43.287
I just want to say thanks
to the suits back there
for allowing us to be here.

1:08:43.320 --> 1:08:45.955
He thinks that's
a two-way mirror.

1:08:45.989 --> 1:08:49.859
-Dee, did you just scale up
the side of the building?
-Free soloed!

1:08:49.893 --> 1:08:53.997
You gotta beef up security.
You know how easy it was for me
to get in that window?

1:08:56.300 --> 1:08:58.968
What kind of people do you think
you're gonna attract with that?

1:08:59.002 --> 1:09:01.805
Young bohemians
with no sexual boundaries.

1:09:01.838 --> 1:09:02.872
(grunts)

1:09:02.906 --> 1:09:04.174

1:09:08.978 --> 1:09:11.915
(upbeat music plays)

1:09:13.650 --> 1:09:15.552
-WOMAN: Oh, my God!
-MAN: Ooh.

1:09:15.585 --> 1:09:17.521
Look at
these hardwood floors!

1:09:17.554 --> 1:09:19.823
(upbeat music plays)

1:09:24.928 --> 1:09:26.563
I'm Brittany's dad.

1:09:26.596 --> 1:09:29.065
I work
in the security industry.

1:09:29.098 --> 1:09:31.034
Have you ever
killed anybody?

1:09:31.067 --> 1:09:32.902
Uh, once.

1:09:34.604 --> 1:09:36.373
I'm just kiddin', mate.
I'm just kiddin'.
