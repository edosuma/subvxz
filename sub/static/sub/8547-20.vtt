Jess, I really appreciate
you doing this last-minute.

01:37.470 --> 01:40.067
I thought when I committed
to chaperoning the field trip,

01:40.069 --> 01:41.835
I would be able
to take the day off.

01:41.837 --> 01:44.171
Don't worry. I'm looking
forward to it, actually.

01:44.173 --> 01:46.875

You ok?

01:53.852 --> 01:55.546
Yeah. I'm good.

01:55.548 --> 01:57.250
A little tired, maybe.

01:57.252 --> 01:59.354
Ok. I left you some cash
in the kitchen,

01:59.356 --> 02:01.353
in case you guys want to
get some pizza tonight.

02:01.355 --> 02:02.355

It's in Bethesda at the home

called the police.

02:46.365 --> 02:48.396
Nothing's been disturbed?
No, ma'am.

02:48.398 --> 02:50.197
You're seeing what
the responding officers saw.

02:50.199 --> 02:52.901
Is that music I hear
in the background?

02:52.903 --> 02:55.867
Yeah. A phonograph in the study
playing “Jingle Bells”

02:55.869 --> 02:57.107
over and over.

02:57.109 --> 02:58.802

02:58.804 --> 03:00.441
The unsub may have been
trying to recreate

03:00.443 --> 03:01.905
the atmosphere
of a holiday meal.

03:01.907 --> 03:03.711

their hands were bound.

Maybe two of the intended
victims were no-shows.

03:12.152 --> 03:13.350
Or managed to escape?

03:13.352 --> 03:14.813
Well, escape seems unlikely

in the house, Ezra?

Were you and Lance
friends?

05:03.471 --> 05:05.268
We were in love.

05:06.334 --> 05:09.267
Why didn't we just stay away

05:09.269 --> 05:11.171
Who wanted you
to stay away?

05:11.173 --> 05:13.170
Lance's dad.
He hated me.

05:13.172 --> 05:14.473
Because you're gay?

05:14.475 --> 05:15.473
Yeah.

05:15.475 --> 05:18.442
But, you know,
Lance said screw it.

05:18.444 --> 05:20.483
It was his mom's birthday
and we were gonna go

of the night.

06:02.426 --> 06:05.557
So I go down
the stairs and...

06:05.559 --> 06:10.063
I hear this creepy
Christmas music playing.

06:11.769 --> 06:15.063

<font color="#D900D9">[Crying]</font>

06:20.746 --> 06:22.241

So your response was to run back upstairs
and hide in the bedroom.

06:39.446 --> 06:43.452
I panicked. I saw police car
lights outside and I panicked.

06:46.188 --> 06:47.849
Why did we have to go?

06:47.851 --> 06:50.183
Why didn't we just stay away?

06:51.153 --> 06:53.254
Why?

06:56.729 --> 07:00.567
There's no sign of robbery
or forced entry.

07:00.569 --> 07:03.568
Dirty dishes in the sink.
They already had their birthday dinner.

07:03.570 --> 07:06.569
4 dishes,
4 sets of silverware.

07:06.571 --> 07:09.106
Frank, Donna, Clara,
and Jenna.

07:09.108 --> 07:12.116
But 5 wine glasses.

07:12.118 --> 07:13.252
You're right.

07:13.254 --> 07:15.420
So who joined them
for a drink?

07:17.054 --> 07:19.588
I guess the killer
wanted the victim to go through

07:19.590 --> 07:22.124
a make-believe dinner
again before he shot them.

07:22.126 --> 07:24.826
I don't think so.

07:24.828 --> 07:25.922
Look.

07:25.924 --> 07:28.928
The splatter,
it's on the tablecloth

07:28.930 --> 07:30.233
but not the plates.

07:30.235 --> 07:32.128
He shot them first
and then set the table.

07:32.130 --> 07:35.092
The ritual wasn't
for the victims,

07:35.094 --> 07:37.629
it was for the unsub's
own gratification.

07:40.133 --> 07:42.598
Obviously there was some
sort of fight in here.

07:42.600 --> 07:45.628
Or someone wanting
to make it look that way.

07:45.630 --> 07:46.835
What do you mean?

07:46.837 --> 07:48.635
There's precision
to the disarray.

07:48.637 --> 07:50.666
In an actual fight,
damage tends to follow

07:50.668 --> 07:52.939
the path of the struggle,
much like debris in a storm.

07:52.941 --> 07:54.804
This feels more like
a calm, methodical

07:54.806 --> 07:56.108
breaking of specific items.

07:56.110 --> 07:58.148
And coupled with
the dining table,

07:58.150 --> 08:00.241
that's very elaborate staging.

08:00.243 --> 08:04.612
It's more like pathology
than a diversionary tactic.

08:04.614 --> 08:07.749
Look, the music's
arranged by genre.

08:07.751 --> 08:09.381
Got big band, classical,

08:09.383 --> 08:12.453
jazz, and Christmas music.

08:12.455 --> 08:14.518
Hey, Spence.

08:18.265 --> 08:20.433
<font color="#808080">Hotch:</font> Dillon Kingman's

08:20.435 --> 08:22.433

08:22.435 --> 08:23.937
No activity on his cell
phone or credit cards.

08:23.939 --> 08:26.433
And Jenna's last social media
post said that her boyfriend

08:26.435 --> 08:28.040
was at the house
the day of the murders.

08:28.042 --> 08:29.975
I'm having him brought in.

08:29.977 --> 08:31.407
How'd it go?

08:31.409 --> 08:34.477
I'll be the first to admit
my gut's not infallible.

08:34.480 --> 08:36.813
3 marriages and 3 divorces
can attest to that.

08:36.816 --> 08:39.381
But right now it's telling me
Ezra didn't do it.

08:39.383 --> 08:42.515
And for what it's worth,
my gut is with Rossi on this one.

08:42.517 --> 08:44.914
Did both of your guts
forget he tried to flee

08:44.916 --> 08:46.553
the crime scene
covered in blood?

08:46.555 --> 08:49.217
Lance and Ezra were a couple.

08:49.219 --> 08:51.210
His grief seems genuine,

08:51.234 --> 08:53.456
and there was no gunshot
residue on his hands.

08:53.688 --> 08:55.454
And all the victims
were corralled one by one,

08:55.456 --> 08:57.695
tied up, positioned at a table,
and then executed.

08:57.697 --> 08:59.864
After which, the killer
laid out a table setting

08:59.866 --> 09:01.832
that would make
Martha Stewart proud.

09:01.834 --> 09:04.001
<font color="#808080">Morgan:</font> Ezra was too wasted
to manage all of that.

09:04.003 --> 09:05.937

are on their way back.

09:05.939 --> 09:08.085
Blood was also found
in Frank Kingman's study.

09:08.109 --> 09:09.011
It's at the lab.

09:09.012 --> 09:12.211
Well, if that turns out to be Frank's,
aybe this is a kidnapping.

09:12.213 --> 09:14.244
There is a lot of money in the family.
Donna's an heiress.

09:14.246 --> 09:15.884
Frank works
in commercial real estate.

09:15.886 --> 09:17.882
It doesn't make any sense
as a kidnapping strategy.

09:17.884 --> 09:21.753
Murder 4 people and then
expect a ransom to be paid?

09:21.755 --> 09:24.018
Sir, I found something.

09:24.020 --> 09:26.828
So, eldest son, Dillon Kingman,
has a fancy car

09:26.830 --> 09:29.531
and a fancy apartment,
but no visible means of support.

09:29.533 --> 09:31.027

and presto.

we went to the mall

a birthday gift.

to dinner last night?

10:11.109 --> 10:13.969
No. I was working.

10:13.971 --> 10:17.575
Um, I deliver packages
for a courier service.

10:17.577 --> 10:19.742
Someone can confirm this?

10:19.744 --> 10:22.109
Wait.

10:22.111 --> 10:24.276
You--you think
that I did it?

10:24.278 --> 10:27.412

establish an alibi.

10:27.414 --> 10:29.452

I put in my notice

10:29.454 --> 10:31.084
and then finished out
my shift.

10:31.086 --> 10:32.588
Why did you quit?

10:32.590 --> 10:34.188
I've been meaning to
for a while.

10:34.190 --> 10:36.156
They make us use our own
cars for deliveries

10:36.158 --> 10:38.420
and don't reimburse us
enough for gas.

10:38.422 --> 10:41.365
Tell us about
Jenna's family.

10:41.367 --> 10:43.197
Enemies? Problems?

10:43.199 --> 10:45.629
Not really.

10:45.631 --> 10:48.605
Jenna's dad
was kind of weird.

10:48.607 --> 10:51.437
Paranoid. Always
accusing people of things.

10:51.439 --> 10:53.405
For instance?

10:53.407 --> 10:56.642
He kept telling me that I'd better
not get his daughter pregnant,

10:56.644 --> 11:00.810
which is crazy, because me and Jenna
weren't even having sex.

11:00.812 --> 11:03.314
She was waiting
till she got married.

11:03.316 --> 11:05.912
What about Lance and Ezra?

11:05.914 --> 11:09.318
Mr. Kingman was a jerk
about them, too.

11:09.320 --> 11:11.484
Jenna told me that
nobody in the house

11:11.486 --> 11:13.987
was even allowed to talk
about how Lance was gay.

11:13.989 --> 11:16.219
And Jenna's older
brother Dillon?

11:16.221 --> 11:18.491
I barely met him.

11:18.493 --> 11:20.595
He and his dad
hated each other, though.

11:20.597 --> 11:23.628
It sounds like Frank Kingman
didn't play well with others.

11:23.630 --> 11:25.028
He didn't.

11:25.030 --> 11:26.597
Which is weird,

11:26.599 --> 11:30.068
because Jenna's mom
was really nice.

11:30.070 --> 11:33.834
Do you know what the issues were
between Dillon and his father?

11:33.836 --> 11:35.105
No.

11:35.107 --> 11:36.607
I asked Jenna
about it once

11:36.609 --> 11:38.774
and she changed
the subject.

11:38.776 --> 11:43.008
She knew, she just
didn't want to tell me.

11:44.978 --> 11:47.448
Just sign and initial right there,
we'll be ready to go.

11:47.450 --> 11:48.616
Thank you very much,
officer.

11:48.618 --> 11:49.848
No problem,
Mr. Hotchner.

11:49.850 --> 11:51.888
It's tough, I know.

11:51.890 --> 11:53.519
Was there any damage?

11:53.521 --> 11:55.119
A broken window is all.

11:55.121 --> 11:56.928
The store owner knows
the situation.

11:56.930 --> 11:59.225
He's sympathetic.
He isn't going to press any charges.

11:59.227 --> 12:00.930
All he wants
is his window replaced.

12:00.932 --> 12:02.202
Of course.

12:02.204 --> 12:04.266
When did your father-in-law
sell the store?

12:04.268 --> 12:06.434
Uh, 2008.

12:06.436 --> 12:09.106
I used to go there with my parents
when I was a kid.

12:09.108 --> 12:12.241
Mr. Brooks was so nice.
He'd always show me a card trick.

12:12.243 --> 12:13.745
That sounds like him.

12:13.747 --> 12:15.512
Well, ok,
I think he's ready.

12:15.514 --> 12:16.544
<font color="#D900D9">[Buzzer]</font>

12:16.546 --> 12:20.110
Roy, I brought you
a coat in case you want--

12:20.112 --> 12:22.045
Shut up.

12:27.472 --> 12:28.942
Frank Kingman
did a lot of business

12:28.944 --> 12:32.478
in the Toronto area, so we've
got the border patrol on alert.

12:32.689 --> 12:34.888
You know, this is beginning
to remind of “Clue.”

12:34.890 --> 12:37.518
Colonel Mustard's in the billiard room
with the candlestick.

12:37.520 --> 12:38.926
Well, if it's clues
you're looking for,

12:38.928 --> 12:40.222
we might be able
to help you.

12:40.224 --> 12:42.062
Prints from an extra wine glass
in the kitchen sink

12:42.064 --> 12:43.728
belong to Lance Kingman.

12:43.730 --> 12:47.464
Lance and his dad were supposedly
in the middle of a blowout argument,

12:47.466 --> 12:48.736
not sipping Merlot.

12:48.738 --> 12:50.137
I guess they
worked things out.

12:50.139 --> 12:51.370
Or Ezra's lying.

12:51.372 --> 12:53.410
What if Lance caved
to his father's wishes

12:53.412 --> 12:54.906
and ended things with Ezra?

12:54.908 --> 12:56.378
That could have pushed
Ezra over the edge.

12:56.380 --> 12:57.778
<font color="#808080">Rossi:</font>
My money's on Dillon.

12:57.780 --> 13:00.018
Deep in debt,
hated his father, still AWOL.

13:00.020 --> 13:02.420
And with everyone dead,
maybe a lot of that

13:02.422 --> 13:05.053
Stancroft Electronics money
funnels his way.

13:05.055 --> 13:07.660
Frank Kingman isn't necessarily dead.
What if he's the killer?

13:07.662 --> 13:08.757
I'm not seeing the why.

13:08.759 --> 13:10.892
Same why that applies to Dillon.

13:10.894 --> 13:12.700
Inheritance money.

13:12.702 --> 13:14.396
We'd better find one
or both of them soon.

13:14.398 --> 13:15.106
Dillon already found us.

13:15.130 --> 13:17.339
He just turned himself in
to Alexandria P.D.

13:17.607 --> 13:19.606
They're bringing him here.

13:19.608 --> 13:21.405
I'm so sorry, Aaron.
How is he?

13:21.407 --> 13:24.340
He's resting. Jessica,
when was the diagnosis?

13:24.342 --> 13:25.909
Last week.

13:25.911 --> 13:28.918
Why didn't you
say anything?

13:28.920 --> 13:31.615
He's my father.
He's my responsibility,

13:31.617 --> 13:33.624
not yours.

13:33.626 --> 13:36.759
I was gonna talk to you
about it tonight.

13:36.761 --> 13:40.424
I even left an assisted living
brochure on your desk.

13:40.426 --> 13:41.800
Ok. Well, he's fine,

13:41.802 --> 13:43.465
and we'll both see you guys

13:43.467 --> 13:45.201
when you get back
from the museum, ok?

13:45.203 --> 13:46.337
Thanks, Aaron.

13:46.339 --> 13:48.369
Good-bye.

14:08.258 --> 14:09.856
This is ridiculous.

14:09.858 --> 14:12.329
Coming all the way up here.

14:12.331 --> 14:13.562
I'm not even dressed.

14:13.564 --> 14:15.065
Jessica said she'll
bring you some clothes

14:15.067 --> 14:16.568
when she and Jack
come home.

14:16.570 --> 14:19.336
I got all kinds of clothes
at my house.

14:23.009 --> 14:25.242
What are you doing?

14:25.244 --> 14:28.313
I've got an active case
that I need to stay on top of.

14:28.315 --> 14:30.081
Thought you had an office
for that.

14:30.083 --> 14:32.786
I do, but I can
stay in touch

14:32.788 --> 14:34.786
with the phone
and the computer.

14:34.788 --> 14:38.120
I don't need no damn
babysitter.

14:40.153 --> 14:42.224
You're enjoying this,
aren't you?

14:44.257 --> 14:45.926
No, I'm not.

14:45.928 --> 14:48.198
The hell you aren't.
You're mad

14:48.200 --> 14:52.196
because I've never
forgiven you for what happened.

14:52.198 --> 14:54.666
And now this is payback.

14:54.668 --> 14:57.400
Roy, this has nothing
to do with the past.

14:57.402 --> 14:59.368
The hell it doesn't.

14:59.370 --> 15:02.535
It has everything to do
with what we are.

15:02.537 --> 15:04.103
It's all we got.

15:04.105 --> 15:07.710
You. Me.

15:07.712 --> 15:09.910
And the sweet past.

15:12.015 --> 15:15.316
<font color="#D900D9">[Scoffs]</font> Damn.

15:30.516 --> 15:32.850
So, Dillon told police
that he had been hiking

15:32.852 --> 15:35.226
through the Great Smoky Mountains
for the past week.

15:35.228 --> 15:37.891
Right. And Elvis
is alive and well

15:37.893 --> 15:40.963
and cutting a new album
in my basement.

15:40.965 --> 15:45.201
Well, shall we see
what he has to say for himself?

15:46.570 --> 15:48.230
You've got to find
my father.

15:48.232 --> 15:49.999
He's the one
who did this.

15:50.001 --> 15:51.398
You sound awfully certain.

15:51.400 --> 15:52.702
Everyone's dead,
and he's gone.

15:52.704 --> 15:53.838
Who else could it be?

15:53.840 --> 15:55.605
Ok. Well, let's talk
about who else,

15:55.607 --> 15:57.005
starting with you.

15:57.007 --> 15:58.844
Me?
Mm-hmm.

15:58.846 --> 16:00.908
If I did it, why the hell
would I turn myself in?

16:00.910 --> 16:04.715
Mm. Insider tip, Dillon.
We tend to look doubly hard

16:04.717 --> 16:06.441
at the helpful suspects.

16:06.443 --> 16:09.582
Now, I don't suppose there was anyone
on that trail in Tennessee

16:09.584 --> 16:11.212
that can verify
your alibi?

16:11.214 --> 16:13.978
I did not kill my family.

16:13.980 --> 16:17.543
We're wasting time
right now. Move on.

16:18.681 --> 16:21.918
Ok. Uh, what can you tell me
about Ezra Warren?

16:21.920 --> 16:22.950
Lance's boyfriend?

16:22.974 --> 16:24.751
Why do you want
to know about him?

16:24.752 --> 16:27.189
Assume I've got my reasons.

16:27.191 --> 16:30.558
I don't know.
Ezra's a weird guy.

16:30.560 --> 16:33.258
Druggie.
He's got a bad temper.

16:33.260 --> 16:34.690
How do you know
about his temper?

16:34.692 --> 16:37.162
I saw him kick
my dad's Jaguar once.

16:37.164 --> 16:38.194
Hard.

16:38.196 --> 16:40.531
He put a dent
in the side this big.

16:41.868 --> 16:44.736
Ok, now, what about
your sister Jenna?

16:44.738 --> 16:47.270
Anything we should know
about her?

16:47.272 --> 16:49.701
Jen...

16:49.703 --> 16:51.836
She was just
a party girl.

16:51.838 --> 16:54.738
She liked to have fun.
Not really bright.

16:54.740 --> 16:59.807
Her boyfriend Marc painted
a much more conservative picture.

16:59.809 --> 17:03.874
That she was saving herself
for sex until she was married.

17:03.876 --> 17:06.407
Saving herself?

17:06.410 --> 17:08.608
No, that ship sailed
long before Marc.

17:08.611 --> 17:11.648
Jenna told me
the no sex part was his idea.

17:11.651 --> 17:14.217
She wanted
to jump his bones.

17:14.219 --> 17:16.786
But why would Marc lie
about something like that?

17:16.788 --> 17:19.888
I've got a theory.

17:19.891 --> 17:23.290
Now would be a great time
to share that theory.

17:23.291 --> 17:25.729
Put it this way--

17:25.731 --> 17:27.695
Marc was a lot more
into Lance

17:27.698 --> 17:29.727
than my sister.

17:29.729 --> 17:31.429
You think Marc was gay.

17:31.431 --> 17:33.061
That's how
it looked to me.

17:33.063 --> 17:35.228
So he was only dating
your sister Jenna

17:35.230 --> 17:36.964
to get close
to your brother.

17:36.966 --> 17:38.531
I'm telling you
what I saw.

17:38.533 --> 17:40.169
And trust me,

17:40.171 --> 17:42.263
Ezra saw it, too.

17:44.534 --> 17:46.467
<font color="#D900D9">[Cell phone rings]</font>

17:48.203 --> 17:49.705
What have you got, Garcia?

17:49.707 --> 17:51.506
Sir, I'm sorry to bother you,
but you told me to call

17:51.508 --> 17:52.770
if I found something,
and I found something.

17:52.772 --> 17:54.171
Yeah, what is it?

17:54.173 --> 17:56.948
Ok, going through Frank
Kingman's business, the financials.

17:56.950 --> 17:58.483
He's been paying
a consulting fee

17:58.485 --> 18:01.948
of $20,000 twice a year
for the last 25 years

18:01.950 --> 18:03.957
to a C.L. Gilliam
and Associates.

18:03.959 --> 18:06.791
Ok. Firstly, there isn't
nor has there ever been

18:06.793 --> 18:09.591
a company in the United States
working under that name.

18:09.593 --> 18:12.261
Secondly, the payments
abruptly stopped 10 months ago.

18:12.263 --> 18:14.830
Right around the time Frank
stopped sending money to Dillon.

18:14.832 --> 18:16.534
Exactamente. And thirdly,

18:16.536 --> 18:18.871
the payments were made
at the same dates every year,

18:18.873 --> 18:21.872
May 3 and--
creepy drumroll--December 24.

18:21.874 --> 18:23.837
Jingle the jingle bells,
anyone? Hmm?

18:23.839 --> 18:25.646
All right, expand
your search for Gilliam

18:25.648 --> 18:27.646
and see if May 3 holds
any special significance

18:27.648 --> 18:29.511
right.
For the Kingman family.

18:29.513 --> 18:32.519
So why aren't you
on speaking terms with your father?

18:32.521 --> 18:34.023
I hate the man.

18:34.025 --> 18:36.191
I always have.

18:36.193 --> 18:37.487
Really?

18:37.489 --> 18:39.695
Why does that
surprise you?

18:39.697 --> 18:43.830
Personally, I would--
i would find it hard to hate someone

18:43.832 --> 18:47.997
that gave me $5,000 a month
for 7 years, but...

18:47.999 --> 18:51.469
No, that--that was just
an advance on my trust fund.

18:51.471 --> 18:53.838
Of course it was.

18:55.544 --> 18:58.477
You have a lot of money
issues now, don't you, Dillon?

18:58.479 --> 19:00.613
Debt. Behind on your rent.

19:00.615 --> 19:03.350
My entire family
just got murdered.

19:03.352 --> 19:05.086
I could be next.

19:05.088 --> 19:06.398
Please, forgive me

19:06.422 --> 19:08.262
if I'm not worried about
unpaid rent right now.

19:08.290 --> 19:09.370
Yeah, the thing is, Dillon,

19:09.385 --> 19:10.985
you weren't worried
two weeks ago either.

19:11.489 --> 19:14.061
What are you talking about?

19:14.063 --> 19:16.523
You were pricing condos
in Georgetown.

19:16.525 --> 19:18.091
Expensive ones.

19:18.093 --> 19:22.438
Almost like you were expecting
some sudden change of fortune.

19:23.673 --> 19:26.975
It checks out.
Frank brought his Jaguar

19:26.977 --> 19:28.196
in February to the body shop

19:28.220 --> 19:30.220
to repair a shoe-sized dent
on the driver's door.

19:30.241 --> 19:33.014
So, Ezra does have a history
of violent behavior

19:33.016 --> 19:34.478
towards Frank Kingman.

19:34.480 --> 19:37.415
That along with being odd man out
in the love triangle.

19:37.417 --> 19:41.421
My gut hasn't gotten any more reliable
since my third divorce.

19:41.423 --> 19:43.021
Thank you, Penelope.

19:43.023 --> 19:44.254
Mm-hmm.

19:45.160 --> 19:46.790
I heard you were hungry,

19:46.792 --> 19:49.891
so I thought I might bring you
a little surprise.

19:49.893 --> 19:51.890
What is in this?

19:51.892 --> 19:54.394
It's a croissant
and it's still warm!

19:54.396 --> 19:56.498
Oh, you love me
and I love you.

19:56.500 --> 19:58.034
I know I flirt
with Derek,

19:58.036 --> 19:59.336
but that's like
an animal blood

19:59.338 --> 20:00.632
in the nostrils
type of thing.

20:00.634 --> 20:03.672
What we have is a pure
transcendent blueberry-filled--

20:03.674 --> 20:04.968
<font color="#D900D9">[beep]</font>
Uh-oh.

20:04.970 --> 20:06.473
What is it?

20:06.475 --> 20:10.115
Uh, Dillon Kingman's Great Smoky alibi
just went up in smoke.

20:10.117 --> 20:11.652
And according
to his credit card,

20:11.654 --> 20:13.653
he went to the same
local gas station twice yesterday.

20:13.655 --> 20:15.821
2.2 gallons at 7:03 a.m.

20:15.823 --> 20:19.558
And 15.4 gallons
at 9:22 p.m.

20:19.560 --> 20:20.789
What kind of car
does he drive?

20:20.791 --> 20:22.461
Audi A6, 2012.

20:22.463 --> 20:24.364
With a highway to city
ration of 4 to 1,

20:24.366 --> 20:26.132
averaged to 29 miles
per gallon,

20:26.134 --> 20:27.667
which is standard for
that make, model, and year,

20:27.669 --> 20:30.730
he traveled roughly 450 miles, which
assuming one way and back

20:30.732 --> 20:33.169
puts his destination--
225 miles away.

20:39.475 --> 20:42.545
I want to believe you,
Ezra. I really do.

20:42.547 --> 20:44.545
But it's not getting
any easier.

20:44.547 --> 20:48.082
The car thing was a one-time deal.
I just lost my temper.

20:48.084 --> 20:50.155
What about Marc Clifford?

20:50.157 --> 20:51.387
Jenna's boyfriend?

20:51.389 --> 20:53.260
Well, rumor has it
that Marc and Lance

20:53.262 --> 20:55.660
spent time together.

20:55.662 --> 20:58.164
What are you getting at?
Marc is straight.

20:58.166 --> 21:01.636
Is he? Because Marc chose
not to have sex with Jenna

21:01.638 --> 21:03.468
even though
she was more than willing.

21:03.470 --> 21:05.372
Yeah, probably because
he was too busy screwing around

21:05.374 --> 21:07.508
with his other girlfriends.

21:07.510 --> 21:10.172
That's right. He had
two or three around town.

21:10.174 --> 21:12.475
Lance found out, got pissed,
told him to knock it off.

21:12.477 --> 21:14.843
He didn't want his sister
getting hurt like that.

21:14.845 --> 21:18.515
Lance took that much
interest in his sister's dating life?

21:18.517 --> 21:21.218
Well, with what was going on
with the parents, yeah.

21:21.220 --> 21:23.186
What do you mean?

21:24.524 --> 21:27.691
Nobody was supposed
to know this, but...

21:27.693 --> 21:29.563
They were planning
on separating.

21:29.565 --> 21:31.931
The marriage was finished.

21:36.005 --> 21:38.571
I made you a sandwich, Roy,
if you're hungry.

21:38.573 --> 21:42.043
This is what you and Jessica
have been doing behind my back.

21:42.045 --> 21:44.243
You went through my desk?

21:44.245 --> 21:46.107
I'm an old man
with Alzheimer's.

21:46.109 --> 21:49.682
I'm not responsible
for my actions.

21:49.684 --> 21:52.114
I didn't even know
about the situation until today.

21:52.116 --> 21:53.513
Ohh...

21:53.515 --> 21:56.216
Happy Hoofers Club.

21:56.218 --> 21:57.985
That's when they take you
to a mall

21:57.987 --> 22:00.719
that you walk around.
Big deal, huh?

22:00.721 --> 22:03.253
You know, bingo tournaments.

22:03.255 --> 22:04.692
Movie nights with popcorn.

22:04.694 --> 22:06.324
What's wrong
with movie nights?

22:06.326 --> 22:09.197
It's a damn nursing home,
that's what's wrong with it!

22:09.199 --> 22:12.198
I can go to the movies
and chew popcorn by myself.

22:12.200 --> 22:14.502
I've been to these places
before.

22:14.504 --> 22:17.301
They take you there
to shrivel up and die.

22:17.303 --> 22:18.972
Roy, the doctors have said
you're gonna need more help.

22:18.974 --> 22:22.435
Doctors. I could write a book
of what doctors don't know.

22:22.437 --> 22:23.571
I'm fine.

22:23.573 --> 22:25.075
You broke into your
old store this morning

22:25.077 --> 22:27.779
and you told the police
that you were opening up for business.

22:27.781 --> 22:28.723
I got a little mixed up.

22:28.747 --> 22:30.482
Now you're not allowed
to get mixed up?

22:30.483 --> 22:31.848
They could have
taken you to jail.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.215
This is jail!

22:33.217 --> 22:35.878
This is jail!

22:35.880 --> 22:39.915
I make a mistake,
a change of clothes fixes that.

22:39.917 --> 22:43.554
You make a mistake...

22:43.556 --> 22:46.449
I lose my daughter.

22:51.290 --> 22:53.424
Yeah.

23:05.357 --> 23:07.092
I'm getting
double-teamed now?

23:07.094 --> 23:10.736
Well, you're in
twice as much trouble now.

23:10.738 --> 23:12.569
Lincoln Tunnel toll booth,

23:12.571 --> 23:14.841
time-stamped at 9:05
yesterday morning.

23:14.843 --> 23:17.105
Nowhere near the Great Smoky Mountains
last time I checked.

23:17.107 --> 23:19.775
And don't bother lying
about who your friend is.

23:19.777 --> 23:21.206
We already know.
Vice I.D.'d her.

23:21.208 --> 23:23.774
She's a call girl
who operates out of D.C.

23:23.776 --> 23:25.110
Clients are lobbyists,
politicos.

23:25.112 --> 23:27.245
I can explain that.

23:28.983 --> 23:32.789
I drive girls to the clients
and I bring them back.

23:32.791 --> 23:34.588
That's all.

23:34.590 --> 23:37.523
I need the job.
I'm about to get evicted.

23:37.525 --> 23:38.587
It's still illegal.

23:38.589 --> 23:40.626
I'm broke.
I mean seriously, broke.

23:40.628 --> 23:43.393
5 grand a month from your
father's just hush money, huh?

23:46.099 --> 23:47.864
He was having an affair.

23:47.866 --> 23:49.367
I found out by accident.

23:49.369 --> 23:52.231
I was home from school
my freshman year of college

23:52.233 --> 23:55.367
and I saw him outside
a motel with some woman.

23:55.369 --> 23:59.839
Freshman. So this affair
had been going on for 7 years?

23:59.841 --> 24:01.975
I think it went on
a lot longer than that.

24:01.977 --> 24:03.575
Why did he cut you off?

24:04.616 --> 24:06.214
He said he ended the affair

24:06.216 --> 24:07.844
and came clean with my mom.

24:07.846 --> 24:09.779
Do you know who
this other woman is?

24:09.781 --> 24:12.282
No. I only saw her
that one time.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.954
She was maybe
in her early 40s,

24:14.956 --> 24:17.249
reddish hair, short.

24:21.393 --> 24:24.824
Ok. And we have a new frontrunner
in the suspect game.

24:24.826 --> 24:26.495
Maybe when Frank
ended things,

24:26.497 --> 24:29.260
his mistress decided
to destroy his family.

24:29.262 --> 24:31.259
Saving the most personal
kill for the wife,

24:31.261 --> 24:32.691
the role she felt
she deserved.

24:32.693 --> 24:34.227
Hell hath no fury.

24:34.229 --> 24:38.834
Except this scorned woman
would be closing in on 50 by now.

24:38.836 --> 24:41.106
Now, Dillon said
she was short.

24:41.108 --> 24:42.632
Would she have
the physicality

24:42.634 --> 24:44.238
to pull off a mass killing
like this?

24:44.240 --> 24:46.605
What if Frank and his mistress
are in this together?

24:46.607 --> 24:49.308
Ezra said Frank and Donna
were planning to separate.

24:49.310 --> 24:51.173
And Donna had
most of the money.

24:51.175 --> 24:54.046
Could be. Get rid
of the family, take the cash,

24:54.048 --> 24:55.550
disappear
to the islands.

24:55.552 --> 24:58.750
Um, I'm not positive,
but I'm pretty, pretty positive

24:58.752 --> 25:00.885
that C.L. Gilliam is...

25:00.887 --> 25:02.388
Cora Gilliam.
She's a bookkeeper

25:02.390 --> 25:03.883
who lives and works
in Rockville, Maryland.

25:03.885 --> 25:05.219
What makes you think
she's the one?

25:05.221 --> 25:07.019
She's the right age.
She fits the description.

25:07.021 --> 25:10.000
She's never been married.
And she was living well above her means

25:10.001 --> 25:12.831
until precisely 10 months ago
when she had to downsize.

25:12.833 --> 25:14.969
She moved to an apartment.
She put up her house for sale.

25:14.971 --> 25:15.937
Huh?

25:15.939 --> 25:18.169
Well, let's
go have a chat.

25:24.246 --> 25:27.887
Cora Gilliam, FBI!
Open the door.

25:33.094 --> 25:35.556
Oh!
Stop!

25:36.893 --> 25:37.994
Gun!

25:37.996 --> 25:40.730
Get your hands away
from the weapon!

25:43.131 --> 25:45.536
Oh!

25:45.538 --> 25:47.999
The gun's registered to me.
I'm allowed to carry it.

25:48.001 --> 25:49.903
Carrying it's not the problem.

25:49.905 --> 25:52.535
Pointing it at FBI agents
is the problem.

25:52.537 --> 25:54.374
I was scared.

25:54.376 --> 25:56.374
I saw the news reports
about Frank and his family.

25:56.376 --> 25:57.773
I thought I could be next.

25:57.775 --> 25:59.212
Do you know where Frank is?

25:59.214 --> 26:02.412
No. We haven't seen
each other in nearly a year.

26:02.414 --> 26:03.749
That's the truth.

26:03.751 --> 26:05.381
How long were
the two of you together?

26:05.383 --> 26:06.380
26 years.

26:06.382 --> 26:08.219
How did it start?

26:09.757 --> 26:11.019
I was 19.

26:11.021 --> 26:13.923
Single mom of a 2-year-old
and barely making it,

26:13.925 --> 26:15.059
and then I met Frank.

26:15.061 --> 26:17.521
Was he married then?

26:20.394 --> 26:23.431
He and his wife had just come back
from their honeymoon.

26:23.433 --> 26:26.861
And that didn't send up
a red flag about his character?

26:26.863 --> 26:28.331
When you're
as desperate as I was,

26:28.333 --> 26:30.930
there's no such thing
as a red flag.

26:30.932 --> 26:34.566
And you yourself never got married
or had any other children?

26:34.568 --> 26:38.530
Frank's a...
controlling person.

26:38.532 --> 26:41.002
We had an agreement.

26:41.004 --> 26:43.568
I would be there for him
exclusively,

26:43.570 --> 26:46.733
and in exchange he'd
take care of me financially.

26:46.735 --> 26:49.331
It sounds colder than
it was. We loved each other.

26:49.333 --> 26:53.235
And then he just suddenly
ended it 10 months ago?

26:53.237 --> 26:56.339
It wasn't all that sudden.

26:56.341 --> 26:58.346
Things had been
winding down.

26:58.348 --> 27:00.681
After my son graduated
high school 6 years ago,

27:00.683 --> 27:02.849
we saw each other
less and less.

27:02.851 --> 27:04.880
Why?

27:05.784 --> 27:08.012
I don't know why.

27:09.315 --> 27:12.247
Maybe he finally
just got tired of me.

27:13.553 --> 27:16.413
Men are men.

27:17.719 --> 27:19.821
<font color="#D900D9">[Door opens]</font>
Dad!

27:19.823 --> 27:21.220
Hey, buddy.
How was it?

27:21.222 --> 27:23.156
I went inside
a space capsule.

27:23.158 --> 27:25.588
Uh-huh.
That's awesome. Was it amazing?

27:25.590 --> 27:27.627
I thought I heard
my favorite grandson.

27:27.629 --> 27:29.323
Look what I got,
grandpa.

27:29.325 --> 27:30.427
Look at that.

27:30.429 --> 27:32.428
A Spitfire MK-2?

27:32.430 --> 27:35.868
That fighter plane is the greatest fighter
plane that was ever built.

27:35.870 --> 27:37.406
Want to play
my new video game?

27:37.408 --> 27:38.576
You want to get beat?

27:38.578 --> 27:39.578
You're goin' down.

27:39.579 --> 27:40.914
You--you--

27:40.915 --> 27:45.584
you're dreaming, boy.
You're dreaming.

27:49.290 --> 27:50.688
How's he been?

27:50.690 --> 27:52.791
Oh, about what you'd expect.

27:52.793 --> 27:55.656
He went through my desk
and found the brochure.

27:55.658 --> 27:57.456
What did he say?

27:57.458 --> 27:59.192
What's this button for?

27:59.194 --> 28:00.432
To turn left.

28:00.434 --> 28:02.232
Oh.

28:02.234 --> 28:03.232
Whoa!

28:03.234 --> 28:04.904
Not that far.

28:04.906 --> 28:06.935
There's no way he can
stay at home, is there?

28:06.937 --> 28:09.071
Not without
around-the-clock help.

28:09.073 --> 28:10.792
He's on a fixed income

28:10.816 --> 28:12.644
and there's no way
that I can afford that.

28:13.345 --> 28:15.575
I'd offer to have him
here, but...

28:15.577 --> 28:17.247
He'd never do that.

28:17.249 --> 28:18.943
I know.

28:18.945 --> 28:21.215
I'm all out of options,
Aaron.

28:21.217 --> 28:23.984
My place is way too small.

28:23.986 --> 28:26.351
His sister said that
she was gonna take him,

28:26.353 --> 28:28.559
but 3 days ago
she broke her hip.

28:28.561 --> 28:31.589
And that place
in West Virginia,

28:31.591 --> 28:33.596
they need an answer
by tomorrow,

28:33.598 --> 28:36.394
or otherwise they'll give it
to someone else.

28:36.396 --> 28:38.697
I'm an awful person.

28:38.699 --> 28:39.993
No, you're not.

28:39.995 --> 28:43.065
It's gonna kill him.

28:43.067 --> 28:44.802
He's a proud man.

28:44.804 --> 28:47.636
And nobody wants to give up
their independence.

28:47.638 --> 28:51.706
And my whole life,
he was the rock.

28:53.949 --> 28:55.610
I have to go back to work,

28:55.612 --> 29:00.249
but stay for dinner and we'll both talk
to him tonight. Ok?

29:00.251 --> 29:01.985
Thank you.

29:01.987 --> 29:04.857
I don't want
to do this alone.

29:10.360 --> 29:11.861
<font color="#D900D9">[Jack laughs]</font>

29:11.863 --> 29:13.659
Yeah, but that's yours.

29:13.661 --> 29:15.858
Yeah, I got the knack
of it now.

29:15.860 --> 29:18.794
Now I'm gonna whup you.
You're toast.

29:18.796 --> 29:19.993
You're toast.

29:19.995 --> 29:21.864
Yeah, well, we'll see.

29:21.866 --> 29:23.997
I'm the Wookiee master.

29:23.999 --> 29:26.427
You're about to be
dethroned.

29:26.429 --> 29:27.843
You let Cora go?

29:27.844 --> 29:29.148
Apparently she's still got
enough money

29:29.172 --> 29:31.162
tucked away
to dial up a good lawyer.

29:31.163 --> 29:33.403
Hotch says
he's on his way back.

29:38.376 --> 29:39.878
All right, spill it, Spence.

29:39.880 --> 29:42.014
You got that thing going on.

29:42.016 --> 29:44.046
Cora said when she met
Frank, she had a child.

29:44.048 --> 29:45.181
Yeah, that's right.

29:45.183 --> 29:46.517
But then she said
that same kid

29:46.519 --> 29:48.557
graduated from
high school 6 years ago.

29:48.559 --> 29:50.188
If he was two
when she met Frank,

29:50.190 --> 29:51.723
he would have graduated
10 years ago.

29:51.725 --> 29:53.187
The math doesn't line up.

29:53.189 --> 29:54.690
Well, it does if
she didn't have the child

29:54.692 --> 29:56.194
until after
she met Frank Kingman.

29:56.196 --> 29:58.859
What if her kid
is actually his?

30:00.564 --> 30:02.161
And there's no paper trail?

30:02.163 --> 30:04.296
Sir, I really can't find
anything.

30:04.298 --> 30:05.283
Cora's child must have been

30:05.307 --> 30:07.537
home-schooled, home-doctored,
home everything.

30:07.968 --> 30:09.732
Frank probably demanded
complete secrecy.

30:09.734 --> 30:12.003
An illegitimate child
would destroy the marriage.

30:12.005 --> 30:13.667
I'll keep digging,
but there's not--

30:13.669 --> 30:16.740
You said the payments to Cora were.
on May 3 and Christmas Eve, right?

30:16.742 --> 30:17.875
Yeah.

30:17.877 --> 30:18.907
Well, check to see
if May 3

30:18.909 --> 30:20.411
could be
the child's birthday.

30:20.413 --> 30:21.843
His birthday--
his birthday! Yes!

30:21.845 --> 30:24.444
I'm gonna take that
nugget of brilliance and run with it.

30:24.446 --> 30:25.853
All right, thanks.

30:25.855 --> 30:27.421
Have the police been dispatched
to Cora's apartment?

30:27.423 --> 30:28.454
They're on their way.

30:28.456 --> 30:30.055
Well, the kid had motive.
Seeing his mother

30:30.057 --> 30:31.687
unceremoniously dumped
by an absentee dad.

30:31.689 --> 30:34.023
<font color="#808080">Reid:</font> Especially if
he and his mom

30:34.025 --> 30:35.431
were shut out of
the family afterwards.

30:35.433 --> 30:37.400
He came back for revenge.

30:49.409 --> 30:52.510
Ok, but why now?
Did the unsub finally just snap?

30:52.512 --> 30:54.749
Everything fell apart
10 months ago.

30:54.751 --> 30:57.149
The secret affair was out.
The blackmail and extortion stopped.

30:57.151 --> 30:59.551
And something happened in the
Kingman family between then and now.

30:59.553 --> 31:00.751
Jenna got a new boyfriend.

31:00.753 --> 31:03.055
Now, why wouldn't Marc
Clifford have sex with her?

31:03.057 --> 31:04.361
According to Ezra,
he wasn't gay.

31:04.363 --> 31:06.563
And he was sexually active
with other women around town,

31:06.564 --> 31:07.995
so it wasn't a moral issue.

31:07.997 --> 31:10.171
Well, what if he knew
something she didn't?

31:10.173 --> 31:12.467
That she was
his half-sister.

31:23.723 --> 31:25.785
Sit down, Mom.

31:25.787 --> 31:29.162
We have something
to celebrate.

31:30.628 --> 31:32.362
Thanks, baby girl.
You're the best.

31:32.364 --> 31:34.897
Garcia says that Marc Clifford grew up
by the name of Marc Powers.

31:34.899 --> 31:36.399
That's why he was
so hard to find.

31:36.401 --> 31:38.599
Rockville P.D. says
there's no sign of Cora

31:38.601 --> 31:40.102
or anybody else
at her apartment.

31:40.104 --> 31:41.238
Maybe she's on the run.

31:41.240 --> 31:42.933
Or Marc's already
gotten to her.

31:45.407 --> 31:49.077
This house
brings back memories.

31:51.384 --> 31:53.415
It's too bad
you have to sell it.

31:53.417 --> 31:55.519
I never should have
told you the truth.

31:55.521 --> 31:57.751
I would have figured out
that you lied.

31:57.753 --> 32:01.687
You had money,
and then you didn't.

32:02.625 --> 32:04.791
I only lied to protect you.

32:04.793 --> 32:07.663
About who my father
really was.

32:07.665 --> 32:09.231
I can see why.

32:11.371 --> 32:15.305
Instead you gave me
Captain Frank Powers.

32:15.307 --> 32:19.872
Lost in action while
gallantly serving in Desert Storm.

32:19.874 --> 32:21.910
You grieving at home.

32:21.912 --> 32:25.384
Pregnant with his unborn son.

32:25.386 --> 32:27.953
You were a little boy
with no father.

32:27.955 --> 32:29.418
You deserved a hero.

32:32.261 --> 32:33.859
Hero.

32:36.966 --> 32:41.771
Every dinner you would
set out a plate for him.

32:41.773 --> 32:42.971
Remember?

32:42.973 --> 32:46.339
You, me,
and that empty plate.

32:46.341 --> 32:50.673
Night after night
after night.

32:50.675 --> 32:55.048
Keeping alive the hope
that one day he would return.

33:02.290 --> 33:04.792
I want to show you something.

33:18.103 --> 33:19.636
Aah!

33:19.638 --> 33:23.340
<font color="#D900D9">[Gasping]</font>

33:23.342 --> 33:25.140
He's home at last, Mom,

33:25.142 --> 33:27.205
in the spot we always
saved for him.

33:32.465 --> 33:34.269
There's still no sign
of Marc or Cora.

33:34.369 --> 33:35.502
We've put an APB out.

33:35.504 --> 33:37.064
Garcia said Cora
had downsized recently.

33:37.374 --> 33:38.706
That's right. She moved
into the apartment

33:38.708 --> 33:39.769
and put her house
up for sale.

33:39.771 --> 33:41.137
We should find out
if the house has sold yet.

33:41.139 --> 33:45.374
<font color="#D900D9">[Gasping]</font>

33:45.376 --> 33:47.174
Take a seat.

33:47.176 --> 33:49.814
Sit down. Take a seat.

33:53.281 --> 33:55.454
You know how I did it?

33:56.623 --> 34:00.787
I got my gun and some rope...

34:00.789 --> 34:02.889
and I went over to their house.

34:02.891 --> 34:07.320
Lance and his dad
had been arguing,

34:07.322 --> 34:09.757
but they stopped
when I came in.

34:14.328 --> 34:17.303
Frank just gave me
a disgusted look

34:17.304 --> 34:18.905
and left the room.

34:18.907 --> 34:21.306
I was a nuisance as usual.

34:21.309 --> 34:23.676
I followed after Frank.

34:26.416 --> 34:27.951
I hit him with the gun.

34:27.953 --> 34:29.184
He was out cold.

34:29.186 --> 34:32.960
So I tied him up and went back into
the dining room.

34:32.963 --> 34:38.899
I put the gun on Jenna and made
Lance tie everyone to their chairs.

34:38.900 --> 34:40.603
<font color="#D900D9">[Indistinct shouting.
Stop it!

34:40.605 --> 34:42.804
Sit here right now.
Just sit.

34:42.806 --> 34:45.172
No. No, no.

34:45.175 --> 34:46.478
Too tight, huh?

34:46.480 --> 34:48.014
And then I tied Lance up.

34:48.016 --> 34:50.985
I shot them all.

34:53.059 --> 34:56.024
Afterwards, I reset the table.

35:03.363 --> 35:06.297
And put on appropriate music.

35:08.873 --> 35:11.903
<font color="#D900D9">[”Jingle Bells” playing]</font>

35:13.538 --> 35:16.209
And finally...

35:16.211 --> 35:18.746
It was as it should have been.

35:29.254 --> 35:33.018
With me in my rightful spot

35:33.020 --> 35:36.024
at the head of the table.

35:36.026 --> 35:40.525
I brought Frank back here
and killed him.

35:40.527 --> 35:44.795
But at least before
he went, he knew.

35:44.797 --> 35:49.095
You've done
a terrible thing, Marc.

35:49.097 --> 35:50.862
Yeah.

36:01.666 --> 36:04.663
I have a confession
to make.

36:07.201 --> 36:09.007
I called you a liar.

36:09.009 --> 36:14.112
But I told you
a lie, too.

36:14.114 --> 36:16.377
What do you mean?

36:18.188 --> 36:21.217
I told you
I shot them all.

36:21.219 --> 36:24.424
But when I tried to pull the trigger
on Donna, I couldn't.

36:27.488 --> 36:30.726
I strangled her.
And as my hands

36:30.728 --> 36:33.492
I squeezed tighter
around her throat,

36:33.494 --> 36:36.293
I pretended
that she was you, Mom.

36:38.831 --> 36:40.932
What are you
gonna do to me?

36:40.934 --> 36:44.908
I'm gonna reunite
the two of you.

36:44.910 --> 36:46.710
Together at last,

36:46.712 --> 36:47.742
forever.

36:47.744 --> 36:50.245
Marc Clifford, FBI.
Show me your hands.

36:50.247 --> 36:52.918
<font color="#808080">Morgan:</font> Do it now.
Nobody else needs to get hurt.

36:53.816 --> 36:56.620
Don't worry, Mom.

36:56.622 --> 36:59.314
I killed you
already, anyway.

37:01.283 --> 37:03.657
You're as dead as he is.

37:25.936 --> 37:28.237
Dad, can we build
my plane tonight?

37:28.239 --> 37:30.668
Of course. The adults
need a little time first, though, ok?

37:30.670 --> 37:32.339
Ok.

37:34.570 --> 37:36.966
Here we go.

37:36.968 --> 37:38.334
The talk.

37:38.336 --> 37:39.301
Dad...

37:39.303 --> 37:41.907
It's a good facility,
Roy.

37:41.909 --> 37:43.603
It's only 3 hours away--

37:43.605 --> 37:46.241
Actually, Aaron,
I've been thinking.

37:46.243 --> 37:48.745
Dad, do you remember
when I told you

37:48.747 --> 37:51.441
I got a promotion
at my job last month?

37:51.443 --> 37:52.577
Mm-hmm.

37:52.579 --> 37:54.985
That I'd be supervising
a new software unit.

37:54.987 --> 37:56.281
Well, yes.

37:56.283 --> 37:58.289
Well, I was going to use
the extra money

37:58.291 --> 38:00.257
to move into an apartment
closer to town,

38:00.259 --> 38:03.322
but if I stay
in the same complex,

38:03.324 --> 38:06.962
we can get
a two-bedroom place.

38:06.964 --> 38:09.964
I want you to live with me.

38:09.966 --> 38:12.973
Ohh...

38:12.975 --> 38:15.676
That's...

38:15.678 --> 38:18.369
That is very sweet
of you.

38:19.305 --> 38:21.805
But no.

38:21.807 --> 38:22.940
Why not?

38:22.942 --> 38:24.706
Because I don't want
to be a burden.

38:24.708 --> 38:25.841
You wouldn't be.

38:25.843 --> 38:27.608
You're really handy
around the house

38:27.610 --> 38:28.872
and I could use the help.

38:28.874 --> 38:30.671
Mm.

38:30.673 --> 38:32.574
You're awfully quiet.

38:32.576 --> 38:34.645
Well, it's up to you.

38:34.647 --> 38:39.317
I will say that Jack
would like having you close.

38:40.984 --> 38:43.350
Ho Happy Hoofers.

38:43.352 --> 38:46.021
No bingo tournaments.

38:46.023 --> 38:47.052
Hmm.

38:47.054 --> 38:49.122
And we can still have
popcorn and movies.

38:53.530 --> 38:55.224
Ok.

38:56.067 --> 38:57.794
Ok?

38:57.796 --> 38:59.498
Ok.

39:00.867 --> 39:05.503
Ok. I am going
to go get our things.

39:05.505 --> 39:07.805
When we get home,
we can start planning

39:07.807 --> 39:09.301
what your room's
gonna look like.

39:09.303 --> 39:11.036
Great.

39:11.910 --> 39:14.444
I think it's
a good solution.

39:14.446 --> 39:17.579
Oh, I'm sure you think
it's a great solution. Sure.

39:17.581 --> 39:21.048
Given the fact that
you conceived the idea.

39:21.050 --> 39:24.048
My brain may be checking out,

39:24.050 --> 39:26.553
but I'm not an idiot.

39:26.555 --> 39:28.417
Jessica told me a while ago

39:28.419 --> 39:33.562
that her promotion
was in title only.

39:33.564 --> 39:36.763
And this song and dance
that you two have been doing

39:36.765 --> 39:39.531
for my benefit...

39:39.533 --> 39:42.068
You're giving her
the extra money, aren't you?

a rematch on that car race thing.

Ok.

39:51.451 --> 39:53.817

of Haley.

39:59.289 --> 40:01.791
I see her in his eyes.

40:01.793 --> 40:04.927
Small things he does.

40:04.929 --> 40:07.829
I see it, too.

40:07.831 --> 40:10.867
You and me,
we're not good, you know.

40:10.869 --> 40:14.899
I'll never forgive you
for what happened.

40:14.901 --> 40:17.466
I wish you didn't
feel that way.

40:17.468 --> 40:21.642
Oh, don't be
so understanding.

40:21.644 --> 40:25.010
For once,
take the low road

40:25.012 --> 40:27.514
and tell me
to take a hike.

40:27.516 --> 40:30.547
I think about what Haley would want
for this family.

40:30.549 --> 40:32.251
Well, I do, too.

40:32.253 --> 40:34.155
She'd want to be alive still,

40:34.157 --> 40:37.187
and she's want to be
Jack's mom again.

40:37.189 --> 40:40.691
She wouldn't want us
holding on to anger

40:40.693 --> 40:43.793
or pointing fingers
at each other.

40:43.795 --> 40:46.096
I'm pointing anyway.

40:46.098 --> 40:49.600
You'll be rid of me
soon enough.

40:51.337 --> 40:54.133
The doctors told me that

40:54.135 --> 40:56.636
there will
come a day when...

40:56.638 --> 40:59.677
I won't know who she is.

40:59.679 --> 41:02.910
Just a stranger.

41:02.912 --> 41:05.646
No anger.

41:05.648 --> 41:08.052
No pain.

41:08.054 --> 41:10.620
No regret.

41:25.134 --> 41:32.173
You know, this disease
may not be a curse after all.

41:32.175 --> 41:36.341
Come on, Dad, let's go.

41:37.351 --> 41:39.182
