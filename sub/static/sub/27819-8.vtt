00:00.125 --> 00:02.417
Roman Lesnitsky.
Low-level FSB analyst.

00:02.500 --> 00:04.458
He could be the key
to what Pavel is planning.

00:04.542 --> 00:05.959
We wanna hear
all about Kingfisher.

00:06.041 --> 00:08.625
Kingfisher is a project,
and I am the grand designer.

00:08.709 --> 00:10.500
Pavel was tasked with
carrying out my plan.

00:10.583 --> 00:12.625
Hassan Ahmed, the final piece
of the puzzle.

00:12.709 --> 00:15.125
Hassan Ahmed, founder of
a radical Jihadist group

00:15.208 --> 00:17.125
behind a number of bombings
across Indonesia.

00:17.208 --> 00:19.125
So, we get
to Hassan before Pavel.

00:19.208 --> 00:21.125
He's the thread that can unravel
this whole thing.

00:21.208 --> 00:23.041
Eyes on Hassan.
Gonna go loud.

00:25.625 --> 00:26.875
Stick to the plan. I'll cover.

00:26.959 --> 00:28.375
- Go. Go, go, go!
- Go, go.

00:29.750 --> 00:31.208
Alpha Two, going mobile!

00:34.041 --> 00:35.875
Zero, we're being grabbed
by local military.

00:35.959 --> 00:38.041
Colonel Aldo,
Indonesian Armed Forces.

00:38.709 --> 00:39.625
I need to get to the team.

00:39.709 --> 00:41.500
Incoming!

00:43.875 --> 00:45.583
Fuckin' hell, boss!

00:45.834 --> 00:47.750
I may have misled you.
I'm taking us off books.

00:48.083 --> 00:48.959
Illegal ops.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.333
You think it's the right thing
to do, we're good.

00:50.417 --> 00:52.166
I'm going mobile,
tracking Hassan.

00:52.250 --> 00:54.000
I have eyes on a suitcase nuke.

00:54.083 --> 00:56.291
If I get a shot at Hassan,
I'm gonna take it.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:15.125 --> 01:17.500
Sorry about that.

01:21.041 --> 01:23.417
Where were we?

01:23.500 --> 01:25.500
I think you were about
to apologize

01:25.583 --> 01:27.041
for having me drugged, bagged,

01:27.125 --> 01:28.917
and dragged to wherever this is

01:29.000 --> 01:31.417
and offer me a ride home.

01:31.500 --> 01:33.875
Well, you've kept
your sense of humor.

01:33.959 --> 01:35.583
Good.
You'll need it.

01:37.417 --> 01:41.417
Entering Russia
without our permission.

01:41.500 --> 01:43.875
Advancing into Indonesia.

01:43.959 --> 01:46.458
Again, without our permission.

01:46.542 --> 01:48.542
You took your team
off books, Alexander,

01:48.625 --> 01:51.000
and you didn't even tell them.

01:51.083 --> 01:54.917
You risked their entire careers.

01:57.375 --> 01:59.709
I stand by my decisions.

01:59.792 --> 02:01.542
Really?

02:01.625 --> 02:03.917
After all that's happened?

02:04.000 --> 02:06.208
Pavel.

02:06.291 --> 02:08.083
Katrina.

02:08.166 --> 02:10.125
Hassan, the mall,

02:10.208 --> 02:13.500
the bomb, the death, the coup.

02:15.959 --> 02:18.917
You stand by it?

02:19.000 --> 02:22.500
You sent Sergeant Wyatt
and Corporal Novin

02:22.583 --> 02:25.834
after Hassan,
the terrorist you suspected

02:25.917 --> 02:28.291
of working with Pavel Kuragin.

02:31.792 --> 02:33.959
Zero.
Come in, Zero.

02:35.500 --> 02:38.083
Called it.
They've jammed the signal.

02:39.500 --> 02:42.083
Half an hour
since last contact with Chetri.

02:42.166 --> 02:43.375
Yeah, she's smart.

02:43.458 --> 02:45.250
If there was trouble,
she would have got out.

02:45.333 --> 02:47.583
If she got out.

02:52.750 --> 02:54.625
Moving.

03:50.083 --> 03:51.834
- Nobody move!
- Don't move!

03:51.917 --> 03:53.709
Any of your boys
so much as blink

03:53.792 --> 03:55.625
and I'll put holes
in the boss man, here!

03:55.709 --> 03:58.709
Look like you're having some
technical difficulties there.

04:01.333 --> 04:02.458
What the... hey, get down!

04:02.542 --> 04:04.125
Down!

04:06.417 --> 04:08.500
Get to Hassan!
Get to Hassan!

04:08.583 --> 04:10.375
- Go!
- Move!

04:11.834 --> 04:15.208
It's the same assholes
that tried to kill us before!

04:15.291 --> 04:17.416
Get back!

04:18.959 --> 04:20.959
Going for the nuke!

04:21.041 --> 04:23.375
Suppressing!

04:30.375 --> 04:31.959
I got it!
Fall back!

04:33.291 --> 04:35.709
Move, move!

04:43.959 --> 04:45.208
We need to find a way out.

04:45.291 --> 04:47.250
Exit left!

04:50.583 --> 04:52.041
There, on the left.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.542
All right, maybe not.

04:54.625 --> 04:57.000
We'll go up.

04:57.083 --> 04:58.959
Come on, come on, come on!

04:59.041 --> 05:01.375
Get in there!

05:03.417 --> 05:05.583
Wyatt, let's go!

05:08.458 --> 05:11.000
Come on, come on!

05:17.875 --> 05:20.834
We've got a terrorist, a nuke,

05:20.917 --> 05:23.500
and a corrupt military unit
coming after us.

05:23.583 --> 05:26.750

Hands.

07:14.959 --> 07:16.709
Oy.

07:16.792 --> 07:18.083
Oy, have you seen her?

07:18.166 --> 07:19.542
No.

07:19.625 --> 07:21.542
Take a good look.

07:21.625 --> 07:24.250
No.
No, I have not.

07:26.333 --> 07:27.834
That was a trap.

07:27.917 --> 07:29.333
No shit.

07:29.417 --> 07:31.208
They massacred my people.

07:31.291 --> 07:32.375
Yeah, that's because
you were trying

07:32.458 --> 07:34.291
to arm a fucking nuke, asshole.

07:34.375 --> 07:35.709
But you've been set up.

07:35.792 --> 07:38.583
Ten years ago, there was
a mosque planned for this site.

07:38.667 --> 07:41.583
But the developers decided
to build their mall instead,

07:41.667 --> 07:44.166
and now they plan
to make it even bigger,

07:44.250 --> 07:45.417
even brighter.

07:45.500 --> 07:48.375
At least you'll have
a Starbucks, mate.

07:50.333 --> 07:53.417
My nephew did not even
believe in the cause.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.917
He just wanted to impress me.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.500
He thought I was important.

07:57.583 --> 07:59.250
Oh, bro, you are very important.

07:59.333 --> 08:00.166
Trust me.

08:00.250 --> 08:01.792
Teaming up with Pavel.

08:01.875 --> 08:03.000
Yeah.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.417
Living, breathing evidence

08:04.500 --> 08:06.458
of Russia meddling
with a foreign power.

08:06.542 --> 08:07.667
You're our star witness.

08:07.750 --> 08:09.000
How you going for an exfil?

08:09.083 --> 08:11.417
Okay, looks like there's
an employee stairwell.

08:11.500 --> 08:14.250
Back of the department store
over there, one floor down.

08:14.333 --> 08:16.041
Well, there's cameras
at every junction.

08:16.125 --> 08:18.750
If we move, they'll see us.

08:18.834 --> 08:20.667
Stay here, we're dead.

08:20.750 --> 08:24.000
We've got to get Hassan
and the nuke out of here.

08:24.083 --> 08:25.542
Let's go.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.458
Is there a reason

08:29.542 --> 08:32.291
you sent your team in
without you?

08:32.375 --> 08:35.792
A rogue splinter group
within the Indonesian military

08:35.875 --> 08:38.000
was working alongside
the Russians.

08:38.082 --> 08:40.332
I needed to speak
to the military commander

08:40.417 --> 08:41.750
and warn him.

08:41.833 --> 08:43.792
Running your own little black op

08:43.875 --> 08:45.917
on foreign soil...

08:46.000 --> 08:47.709
without licenses?

08:47.792 --> 08:50.709
It's Afghanistan all over again.

08:52.625 --> 08:54.375
What is this place, anyway?

08:54.458 --> 08:55.750
This is the kind of place

08:55.834 --> 08:58.333
we get the right answers,
Alexander.

08:58.417 --> 09:00.500
If we don't...

09:00.583 --> 09:03.083
well, then, perhaps
it's the kind of place

09:03.166 --> 09:04.583
you don't leave.

09:04.667 --> 09:06.792
So...

09:06.875 --> 09:08.208
you went to see

09:08.291 --> 09:11.000
the Military Commander,
General Dewanto,

09:11.083 --> 09:13.875
with no authority whatsoever.

09:13.959 --> 09:16.333
With respect, General Dewanto,

09:16.417 --> 09:19.375
we believe Aldo
has resurrected Skuad Komodo

09:19.458 --> 09:22.208
and may well even be working
with the Russians.

09:22.291 --> 09:23.667
Why would he do that?

09:23.750 --> 09:25.000
For what purpose?

09:25.083 --> 09:28.458
You are the ones conducting
an illegal op in my country.

09:28.542 --> 09:31.000
Colonel Aldo...

09:31.083 --> 09:33.083
is a son of Jakarta.

09:34.750 --> 09:35.750
What's the matter, big fella?

09:35.834 --> 09:38.458
Trouble with your come?

09:38.542 --> 09:39.667
Do you have a safe room here?

09:39.750 --> 09:41.208
Somewhere we can fall back to
if need be?

09:41.291 --> 09:43.250
There is a military escort
due within the hour.

09:43.333 --> 09:45.291
I'm thinking of something
a bit more immediate.

09:45.375 --> 09:47.041
At the same time,

09:47.125 --> 09:49.375
they will take you
and have you thrown

09:49.458 --> 09:51.792
into a high security
military prison.

09:51.875 --> 09:54.458
If Colonel Aldo

09:54.542 --> 09:56.291
were planning a coup,

09:56.375 --> 09:57.500
then the first thing
that he would do

09:57.583 --> 09:59.208
is come after the head
of the military.

10:00.291 --> 10:01.709
Get back!

10:17.709 --> 10:18.709
Clear right.

10:18.792 --> 10:20.166
Yeah, door's clear.

10:20.250 --> 10:22.625
- You okay?
- Dewanto's been hit.

10:29.667 --> 10:31.417
Colonel Aldo.

10:31.500 --> 10:32.917
Have you located them?

10:33.000 --> 10:35.041
We have locked on the building,

10:35.125 --> 10:38.000
but there's still 400,000
square feet of mall to cover.

10:38.083 --> 10:40.542
You need the terrorist.

10:40.625 --> 10:42.166
And you need that bomb.

10:42.250 --> 10:44.667
You are the reason
the British are here.

10:44.750 --> 10:46.417
And I am the one
that armed your men

10:46.500 --> 10:48.750
and gave you this opportunity.

10:48.834 --> 10:50.125
Take down Hassan,

10:50.208 --> 10:52.125
reveal his terrifying bomb plot

10:52.208 --> 10:54.625
to a nation so grateful
to be saved,

10:54.709 --> 10:57.250
they will cheer you on
as you seize power.

10:57.333 --> 11:00.208
Then maybe we don't
need you anymore.

11:00.291 --> 11:01.667
You need me.

11:01.750 --> 11:04.625
Dewanto is still alive.

11:04.709 --> 11:07.542
Your squad's attempt
to eliminate him failed,

11:07.625 --> 11:10.542
and he will end
your coup like...

11:14.458 --> 11:17.834
I will make sure Dewanto
is taken care of.

11:20.041 --> 11:21.417
You need to let me go in there.

11:21.500 --> 11:24.500
Skuad Komodo have
their reputation for a reason.

11:24.583 --> 11:27.083
They will get the job done.

11:27.166 --> 11:29.000
We need you as our last resort.

11:29.083 --> 11:31.959
And because you don't
trust me, is that it?

11:32.041 --> 11:32.875
No.

11:32.959 --> 11:35.250
Because I don't want
to lose you.

11:43.875 --> 11:45.417
They've got something.

11:45.500 --> 11:47.583
Yeah, they're taking down
surveillance.

11:47.667 --> 11:49.625
There.

11:57.583 --> 11:59.875
Reckon they'll be on their way.

12:01.750 --> 12:04.291
Well, then let's be
somewhere else.

12:04.375 --> 12:06.166
Don't suppose you're a doctor.

12:06.250 --> 12:07.291
No, I'm his translator.

12:07.375 --> 12:09.500
- You got a first aid kit?
- Under the sink.

12:14.500 --> 12:15.625
Need a pair of hands over here.

12:15.709 --> 12:16.875
What's your name?
Sophia.

12:16.959 --> 12:18.750
Sophia, I need you
to help me, okay?

12:18.834 --> 12:21.500
I need you
to go around there, please.

12:21.583 --> 12:23.667
All right, can you put this on?

12:25.000 --> 12:26.458
Put your hands on
and press down on the wound.

12:26.542 --> 12:27.458
Right here, yeah, yeah.

12:27.542 --> 12:28.667
He's not gonna make it, is he?

12:28.750 --> 12:29.834
I've seen worse.

12:29.917 --> 12:32.083
Okay, we stabilize him,
move him out.

12:32.166 --> 12:34.542
Proper medical attention,
he might have a chance.

12:34.625 --> 12:37.041
Switch hands in three, two, one.

12:37.125 --> 12:38.542
Yep.

12:38.625 --> 12:40.542
Boss, if these guys are smart
they might have a back-up plan.

12:40.625 --> 12:41.667
There could be more on the way.

12:41.750 --> 12:44.291
Get the place locked down
best you can.

12:44.375 --> 12:46.000
All right, yeah.

12:46.083 --> 12:48.208
Okay.

12:49.917 --> 12:52.041
You've lost them.

12:53.792 --> 12:56.458
Aldo's surveillance cameras
not used anymore

12:56.542 --> 12:58.500
for good reason.

12:58.583 --> 13:02.250
Lower resolution, wider angles.

13:03.959 --> 13:06.542
Let's go.

13:06.625 --> 13:08.667
But they'll do the job.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.834
I'm wondering...

13:32.917 --> 13:34.458
if it's an arrogance,

13:34.542 --> 13:37.750
the way you thrust
your people into danger.

13:37.834 --> 13:39.542
Should we talk about Helmand?

13:39.625 --> 13:42.208
- It's not relevant.
- I'd say it is.

13:42.291 --> 13:44.083
You took your squad

13:44.166 --> 13:46.208
to meet a hostile Shia warlord

13:46.291 --> 13:49.500
in the hope of an alliance
against the Taliban.

13:49.583 --> 13:52.041
How many people died
in that ambush?

13:52.125 --> 13:55.542
I'd have thought you'd have
learned your lesson.

13:55.625 --> 13:57.750
- I have.
- And there it is.

13:57.834 --> 13:59.166
That temper.

13:59.250 --> 14:02.417
The one that drives you
into your rash decisions.

14:07.875 --> 14:10.792
Why do you think
I rejected command after that?

14:10.875 --> 14:12.250
Sadly, it's common knowledge.

14:12.333 --> 14:14.750
You hit the bottle
and lost your nerve.

14:16.542 --> 14:19.291
My nerve's just find.

14:19.375 --> 14:21.333
That's the problem.

14:21.417 --> 14:23.000
Mind you, if the stakes
were high enough,

14:23.083 --> 14:24.667
I'd do exactly
the same thing again.

14:24.750 --> 14:25.875
I'd risk my team.

14:25.959 --> 14:27.458
And what are those stakes?

14:27.542 --> 14:31.542
This "Kingfisher"
conspiracy of yours?

14:35.500 --> 14:39.291
All Russia really wants
is to be a superpower again.

14:39.375 --> 14:41.667
Ever since their invasion
of the Ukraine,

14:41.750 --> 14:45.417
we've kept them in check
with punitive sanctions.

14:45.500 --> 14:47.750
But this Indonesian coup
was a test run

14:47.834 --> 14:49.917
for a different form of warfare.

14:50.000 --> 14:54.125
Covertly overthrowing nations,
installing puppet leaders,

14:54.208 --> 14:56.250
reaping the economic benefits.

14:56.333 --> 14:59.125
They'd be off the leash.

14:59.208 --> 15:00.667
Sanctions would be irrelevant.

15:00.750 --> 15:02.709
They could roll their tanks
across Eastern Europe

15:02.792 --> 15:04.750
knowing the West
is powerless to intervene

15:04.834 --> 15:08.792
for fear of nuclear conflict,
and if we don't stop them...

15:08.875 --> 15:11.125
You're saying they'd just
carry on into Britain,

15:11.208 --> 15:12.166
into America.

15:12.250 --> 15:13.875
I'm saying they'd be so strong

15:13.959 --> 15:16.166
they could whatever
they damn well wanted.

15:16.250 --> 15:18.083
And you believe
this was the plan

15:18.166 --> 15:21.709
of Pavel and Katrina all along?

15:21.792 --> 15:22.834
I believe this is

15:22.917 --> 15:25.792
an officially sanctioned
Kremlin op, yes.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.041
So this is what you claim
your team was doing:

15:32.125 --> 15:35.375
Extracting Hassan
and the nuclear device

15:35.458 --> 15:39.000
to use as evidence
of Russia's misdeeds.

15:39.083 --> 15:43.417
What is it they say
about the best laid plans?

15:43.500 --> 15:46.291
They're coming this way.
We got to move.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.917
- Hassan's running!
- Shit.

16:15.333 --> 16:17.250
Fuck!

16:28.166 --> 16:29.542
Moving.

16:29.625 --> 16:31.375
Oh, fuck!

16:36.500 --> 16:37.750
Jammed.

16:37.834 --> 16:40.125
Novin.

16:45.375 --> 16:47.166
Yeah.

17:17.375 --> 17:19.000
Clear.

17:19.083 --> 17:20.416
You hurt?

17:20.500 --> 17:24.583
I'm sure there's
something in there, mate.

17:28.500 --> 17:31.250
Yeah, that'll leave a mark.

17:31.333 --> 17:34.000
Just have to find someone
who digs scars, eh?

17:36.834 --> 17:38.417
All right, it's gonna sting.

17:40.125 --> 17:43.417
Three, two...

17:49.750 --> 17:51.291
There's gonna be more coming.

17:51.375 --> 17:53.500
Yeah.

17:53.583 --> 17:55.625
That is why you...

17:55.709 --> 17:57.834
are gonna take the nuke... sorry.

17:59.083 --> 18:01.917
And do a secondary exfil.

18:03.208 --> 18:04.792
Cheers, mate.

18:04.875 --> 18:07.208
I'm pretty sure...

18:07.291 --> 18:08.750
there's some
maintenance elevators

18:08.834 --> 18:11.041
right here, near the food court.

18:11.125 --> 18:12.250
They won't be working,

18:12.333 --> 18:14.583
but you'll be able
to climb down.

18:14.667 --> 18:15.917
What, you're not coming?

18:16.000 --> 18:17.583
Russia arming
radical terrorists?

18:17.667 --> 18:18.750
We need Hassan to talk,

18:18.834 --> 18:21.041
so I'd better find him
before the boys in black do.

18:21.125 --> 18:23.625
Copy that.

18:26.625 --> 18:27.667
Good?

18:27.750 --> 18:30.125
Watch your back.

18:30.208 --> 18:31.959
Oy, if you see Zarkova...

18:32.041 --> 18:35.041
I'll send her your love.

18:35.125 --> 18:36.709
Send her this, too.

18:36.792 --> 18:38.208
Hey, keep an eye out for Chetri.

18:38.291 --> 18:40.792
Kid's got to be
around here somewhere.

19:54.208 --> 19:56.625
You get five seconds.

19:56.709 --> 19:59.667
F-five...

19:59.750 --> 20:02.959
fucking seconds to be scared.

20:07.041 --> 20:08.792
Then you just do it.

20:08.875 --> 20:11.291
Just do it.

20:33.625 --> 20:34.792
Okay.

20:39.250 --> 20:41.458
House is locked down
best we can, boss.

20:41.542 --> 20:43.208
But if it gets all
"Rio Bravo" out there,

20:43.291 --> 20:45.583
we're in trouble.

20:45.667 --> 20:47.834
What about you, General?
Ready to move?

20:47.917 --> 20:49.834
We wait for my men.

20:49.917 --> 20:51.834
I take orders from no one.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.333
We're not giving you orders,
you fool.

20:53.417 --> 20:56.500
We're trying to save
your bloody life.

20:56.583 --> 20:58.834
Give me a moment.

21:07.291 --> 21:10.625
You know what, General,
I'm curious...

21:10.709 --> 21:12.917
about your friend Aldo.

21:13.000 --> 21:17.041
Why did you shut down
his team, Skuad Komodo?

21:17.125 --> 21:18.875
He was a good man,

21:18.959 --> 21:21.083
but he went too far.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.208
Abductions,
extra-judicial killings,

21:25.291 --> 21:27.125
turning your military
into a death squad.

21:27.208 --> 21:30.208
Yeah, I could see how
that could make life difficult.

21:30.291 --> 21:32.375
But you stripped them all
of their ranks,

21:32.458 --> 21:34.709
court marshaled
every last one of them

21:34.792 --> 21:38.125
except for one man.

21:38.208 --> 21:40.917
Why keep Aldo on as Colonel?

21:43.166 --> 21:45.792
I thought it would
make him loyal.

21:51.083 --> 21:53.917
Everything all right?

21:54.000 --> 21:56.750
Yeah, just thinking.

21:56.834 --> 21:59.000
If you hadn't have
stopped those men.

21:59.083 --> 22:00.291
You can't play "what if."

22:00.375 --> 22:03.041
Yes, you can.
Everyone does.

22:03.125 --> 22:05.250
What if you had a different job?

22:05.333 --> 22:08.875
What if you didn't have
to do the things you do?

22:15.166 --> 22:17.542
What if you stop worrying?

22:17.625 --> 22:19.458
Trust us.

22:19.542 --> 22:21.458
The General's men will be here
in 15 minutes.

22:21.542 --> 22:23.083
Then we'll be gone.

22:23.166 --> 22:24.375
You risked your life for him

22:24.458 --> 22:26.250
even though he threatened
to have you locked up.

22:28.166 --> 22:31.291
Yeah, well, that's definitely
part of the job.

22:31.375 --> 22:32.875
Risking your life for dickheads.

22:32.959 --> 22:33.917
You joke about it,

22:34.000 --> 22:36.834
but there's not many
like you left, Sergeant.

22:39.041 --> 22:40.291
15 minutes?

22:40.375 --> 22:42.750
Yeah, then we're gone.

23:17.291 --> 23:19.667
They have lost four men already.

23:19.750 --> 23:22.417
Still within
acceptable parameters.

23:24.667 --> 23:26.083
Aldo has sent in his Captain,

23:26.166 --> 23:28.166
but Pavel, you need me in there.

23:28.250 --> 23:29.792
20 see you as a traitor.

23:29.875 --> 23:32.250
They will kill you on sight.

23:32.333 --> 23:35.500
Remember the first week
of Alpha Group?

23:35.583 --> 23:37.417
They taught us Ivan Ilyin,

23:37.500 --> 23:39.166
Russian spirit.

23:49.041 --> 23:51.959
I told you, no Russian.

23:54.291 --> 23:56.834
And be careful.

24:09.583 --> 24:11.709
That one.

24:11.792 --> 24:14.041
That one is mine.

24:32.333 --> 24:35.083
Watch out, guys!

24:44.333 --> 24:46.291
Shit.

25:36.667 --> 25:39.834
Hey, don't!

25:39.917 --> 25:41.083
Step away.

25:41.166 --> 25:43.458
Step away!

25:45.208 --> 25:46.625
Let's go, come on.

25:49.125 --> 25:50.667
Oh, you son of a bitch.

26:22.750 --> 26:24.291
Hassan's coming with me.

26:26.458 --> 26:29.375
Don't you Americans
ever get tired

26:29.458 --> 26:33.625
of telling the rest
of the world how to behave?

26:33.709 --> 26:35.375
Honestly, yeah.

26:35.458 --> 26:37.291
Maybe you should quit, then.

26:37.375 --> 26:40.542
You know...

26:40.625 --> 26:43.375
between you and me...

26:43.458 --> 26:45.917
I've seriously been
considering it.

26:50.834 --> 26:53.000
Please...

26:53.083 --> 26:56.125
walk away.

26:56.208 --> 26:59.208
Can't do that.

28:36.709 --> 28:38.375
Don't even try it.

28:38.458 --> 28:40.959
Drop it.

29:11.709 --> 29:13.166
Thank you.

29:13.250 --> 29:15.542
Well...

29:15.625 --> 29:18.500
I think I should be the one
saying "thank you."

29:18.583 --> 29:20.375
Just for a second there,

29:20.458 --> 29:21.750
I thought we were somebody else.

29:21.834 --> 29:23.333
Somewhere else.

29:23.417 --> 29:25.625
Yeah.

29:26.500 --> 29:29.875
Sooner or later, though...

29:29.959 --> 29:32.083
got to get back to work.

29:33.291 --> 29:35.250
I know.

29:55.208 --> 29:56.625
Hang in there.

29:56.709 --> 29:58.750
Your men will be here
any moment.

29:58.834 --> 30:01.333
Move.
It's only Dewanto I want.

30:01.417 --> 30:04.417
God, you're not working
for Aldo as well, are you?

30:04.500 --> 30:06.458
Nyet.

30:20.709 --> 30:23.250
Pavel is coming.

30:23.333 --> 30:25.583
Run.

30:30.750 --> 30:32.625
Boss, we need to get
the fuck out of here.

30:32.709 --> 30:34.417
Another dead person

30:34.500 --> 30:37.250
who can't confirm your story?

30:37.333 --> 30:39.625
You're accusing Russia

30:39.709 --> 30:41.959
of using deep cover agents

30:42.041 --> 30:45.417
to attempt to assassinate
foreign dignitaries?

30:45.500 --> 30:47.625
Not accusations.

30:47.709 --> 30:50.125
Just facts.

30:50.208 --> 30:52.959
I'll check point.

30:53.041 --> 30:55.083
Get your hands off me.

30:55.166 --> 30:58.125
Look, if my Sergeant
says to move...

30:58.208 --> 31:00.125
we're moving.

31:04.917 --> 31:07.458
Boss?

31:12.083 --> 31:13.834
Get down!

31:16.291 --> 31:18.458
- You hit?
- Yeah.

31:18.542 --> 31:19.917
Get eyes on the tango.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.125
Moving.

31:23.959 --> 31:26.500
Shit.

31:28.709 --> 31:30.917
I warned Dewanto...

31:31.000 --> 31:33.041
over and over again.

31:33.125 --> 31:35.000
Men like Hassan
will come back to haunt us.

31:35.083 --> 31:37.208
Yeah, but you facilitated it.

31:37.291 --> 31:38.625
Along with the Russians.

31:38.709 --> 31:42.125
One of Hassan's bombs
wiped away 13 of our men

31:42.208 --> 31:45.000
over a decade-and-a-half ago.

31:45.083 --> 31:47.792
How can we forgive that?

31:47.875 --> 31:50.959
Even jail was an insult
to their memory.

31:54.041 --> 31:55.750
Colonel, I get it.

31:55.834 --> 31:59.166
You look at men like Dewanto,
you look at your government...

31:59.250 --> 32:01.625
allowing Hassan
to walk free under what?

32:01.709 --> 32:04.542
The guise of, uh...
of rehabilitation?

32:04.625 --> 32:06.625
You ask yourself,

32:06.709 --> 32:08.875
"What was it all for?"

32:08.959 --> 32:10.667
But trust me,
you cannot save your country

32:10.750 --> 32:11.792
by selling it out.

32:11.875 --> 32:13.625
Then you're just a puppet
for the Russians,

32:13.709 --> 32:14.917
and everything you have...

32:15.000 --> 32:18.208
your ports, your resources,
your gas, your oil,

32:18.291 --> 32:21.375
hell, even your army...
it's all theirs.

32:21.458 --> 32:23.166
And that's worse than anything
Dewanto ever did.

32:23.250 --> 32:26.208
Hell, even Hassan was loyal
to his own.

32:28.041 --> 32:30.500
But Colonel, you ask me?

32:30.583 --> 32:33.709
You're not even fit
for the uniform.

34:26.917 --> 34:29.875
Come on.

34:29.958 --> 34:31.708
Gracie!

34:35.125 --> 34:36.792
We can still talk about this.

34:36.875 --> 34:38.417
You wanna talk?

34:38.500 --> 34:41.333
Where the hell is Chetri?

34:47.833 --> 34:51.333
Do you know what this is?

34:51.417 --> 34:53.750
It's a remote transmitter.

34:53.833 --> 34:55.708
Unfortunately, it was damaged

34:55.792 --> 34:57.625
in the fight with
Sergeant Wyatt.

34:57.709 --> 35:00.208
I tried to repair it but, uh...

35:00.291 --> 35:02.458
it needs someone
with more expertise.

35:04.500 --> 35:06.333
I wouldn't...

35:06.417 --> 35:07.375
Hmm?

35:07.458 --> 35:09.458
I wouldn't know where to start.

35:09.542 --> 35:11.375
Oh, please.

35:11.458 --> 35:14.375
You broke out
of a Russian safe house.

35:14.458 --> 35:16.291
You modified my data leecher

35:16.375 --> 35:18.458
to steal intel from a drug lord.

35:18.542 --> 35:21.542
You are very capable.

35:21.625 --> 35:24.542
Much more than I could ever be.

35:31.500 --> 35:33.041
What...

35:33.125 --> 35:35.917
is it for?

35:36.000 --> 35:38.750
It always helps
to have a "plan B."

35:38.834 --> 35:41.291
Why have a bomb...

35:41.375 --> 35:43.542
if it won't go off?

35:46.834 --> 35:49.083
I warned you,
I'm loyal to my country.

35:49.166 --> 35:50.750
This is loyalty?

35:50.834 --> 35:52.417
A bloody nuke?

35:52.500 --> 35:54.417
It was never meant
to be detonated.

35:54.500 --> 35:55.458
Bullshit.

35:55.542 --> 35:57.208
The Indonesian Colonel
takes down Hassan

35:57.291 --> 35:59.959
and shows the nuke as evidence
of how weak the government is.

36:00.041 --> 36:01.333
Yeah, I get it.

36:01.417 --> 36:04.000
It's all a shitty power grab.

36:04.083 --> 36:06.583
Was it worth
the death of your team?

36:08.667 --> 36:12.417
I was there, remember?
I saw what he did to you.

36:15.458 --> 36:17.750
Don't come any closer.

36:17.834 --> 36:19.625
I have this under control.

36:19.709 --> 36:22.041
Don't come any closer!

36:27.542 --> 36:28.959
I didn't need to do that!

36:29.041 --> 36:30.041
Yeah, all right.

36:30.125 --> 36:33.375
How about I write you
a "thank you" card?

36:33.458 --> 36:34.959
Pavel, please.

36:35.041 --> 36:36.625
Think about what you're doing.

36:36.709 --> 36:38.041
I know exactly what I am doing.

36:38.125 --> 36:40.208
Death toll, fallout,
blast radius...

36:40.291 --> 36:42.500
which, by the way,
we are outside.

36:42.583 --> 36:45.709
I mean, it's not
Lesnitsky's plan,

36:45.792 --> 36:48.417
but, you know...

36:48.500 --> 36:51.083
fuck Lesnitsky.

36:52.375 --> 36:53.709
I won't be a part of this.

36:53.792 --> 36:57.750
All of this is only happening
because 20 got in the way.

37:00.125 --> 37:02.667
No one will know...

37:02.750 --> 37:05.500
if you help me.

37:05.583 --> 37:08.458
You can walk away.

37:11.583 --> 37:14.834
I'll know.

37:14.917 --> 37:17.583
Okay.

37:17.667 --> 37:19.834
I tried polite.

37:22.250 --> 37:25.166
Now we do the other way.

37:28.083 --> 37:30.500
It's the transistor, isn't it?

37:35.417 --> 37:38.041
It's broken loose.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.709
Ah.

38:01.542 --> 38:04.250
Always the small things.

38:24.458 --> 38:26.041
Pavel, don't.

38:46.458 --> 38:48.625
Wanna talk?

38:48.709 --> 38:51.375
Where is she?

39:42.291 --> 39:45.166
Don't make me do this.

39:45.250 --> 39:48.333
I doubt you were told
to take me alive.

39:48.417 --> 39:51.834
One of us is going
to have to follow orders.

39:51.917 --> 39:54.041
Not always.

39:54.125 --> 39:55.750
Not if they're wrong.

40:00.291 --> 40:03.417
Oh, fuck it.

40:07.417 --> 40:08.667
I'm tired.

40:08.750 --> 40:12.083
I don't even know
what I'm fighting for anymore.

40:12.166 --> 40:14.417
My team deserved better
than this.

40:23.458 --> 40:25.875
Check it, check it.
Go, go, go.

40:32.250 --> 40:34.709
Bring it over here.

40:38.417 --> 40:41.166
- It's counting down.
- But I don't understand.

40:41.250 --> 40:43.250
He... he said
it couldn't be armed.

40:43.333 --> 40:45.750
160 seconds to detonation.

40:45.834 --> 40:46.917
Uh, okay.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.542
I'm gonna let you
take the lead on this.

40:50.959 --> 40:52.500
Bloody spaghetti junction.

40:52.583 --> 40:54.125
Okay, what have we got here?

40:54.208 --> 40:57.166
There's tampers,
firing currents, reflectors.

40:57.250 --> 40:58.709
The junction box,
explosive lens.

40:58.792 --> 40:59.709
One minute 30.

40:59.792 --> 41:01.250
There's no time
to trace each wire.

41:01.333 --> 41:02.875
Hey!

41:02.959 --> 41:03.875
Wait, wait, wait.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.500
You two working together, or...?

41:05.583 --> 41:07.083
- Nuke is primed.
- What?

41:07.166 --> 41:09.583
- Minute 30.
- Uh, minute 25.

41:09.667 --> 41:11.500
He gets it's an estimate.

41:11.583 --> 41:13.333
You got firing currents,
you got a junction box...

41:13.417 --> 41:15.208
Yeah, we know the parts, Wyatt.

41:15.291 --> 41:17.083
Best option
is to trace a wire and cut it.

41:17.166 --> 41:18.458
Yeah, all right, but which wire?

41:18.542 --> 41:20.000
There's splitters,
and there's intersections here.

41:20.083 --> 41:21.417
Uh, it'd be an educated guess.

41:21.500 --> 41:23.750
- That's the best you got?
- I stress the word "educated."

41:23.834 --> 41:25.000
I don't think
we should touch the wires.

41:25.083 --> 41:26.041
Why not?

41:26.125 --> 41:27.542
Because this is
a Gopan Laghari design,

41:27.625 --> 41:29.667
and I think if we cut one wire,
no matter which one...

41:29.750 --> 41:31.250
It'll detonate anyway.

41:31.333 --> 41:32.917
Exactly.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.250
All right, so what are we doing?

41:34.333 --> 41:36.667
Okay, so it's not easy
to set off a nuclear device.

41:36.750 --> 41:37.709
It's why you need experts.

41:37.792 --> 41:39.250
So I think if we...
if we shoot the bomb,

41:39.333 --> 41:40.834
it will not detonate.

41:40.917 --> 41:42.333
I'm sorry, you're saying
"shoot the bomb"?

41:42.417 --> 41:44.667
No, okay, so to stop
the detonation process

41:44.750 --> 41:46.125
we need to stop the timers,

41:46.208 --> 41:47.500
so we need to target
the countdown battery.

41:47.583 --> 41:49.875
Except there's some
tamper-proof shit in the way.

41:49.959 --> 41:51.750
Which is why
a bullet might work.

41:51.834 --> 41:53.625
So you are saying
shoot the bomb!

41:53.709 --> 41:55.125
As I explained, shooting it

41:55.208 --> 41:56.583
will most likely not set it off.

41:56.667 --> 41:58.500
I am not comfortable
putting a live round

41:58.583 --> 41:59.959
into a thermonuclear device.

42:00.041 --> 42:01.208
Just saying.
40 seconds.

42:01.291 --> 42:03.291
A precise shot could damage
the power supply, but...

42:03.375 --> 42:04.375
"Most likely" and "could"

42:04.458 --> 42:05.875
are not phrases
I'm comfortable with.

42:05.959 --> 42:08.458
Okay, yeah, yeah.
What was your plan again.

42:10.667 --> 42:12.834
All right, fuck it.
Let's shoot the bomb.

42:12.917 --> 42:14.834
- Where's the battery?
- It's the casing on the left.

42:14.917 --> 42:15.959
No, it's over here on the right

42:16.041 --> 42:16.959
with the supply wire.

42:17.041 --> 42:17.959
No, no, no...

42:18.041 --> 42:19.458
I know what I'm fucking
talking about.

42:19.542 --> 42:22.125
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

42:22.208 --> 42:24.792
I... I mean, there's margin
for error, of course.

42:24.875 --> 42:25.834
30 seconds.

42:25.917 --> 42:27.792
Yes or no?

42:31.291 --> 42:32.542
Yes.

42:32.625 --> 42:35.000
Good enough for me.

42:44.417 --> 42:45.375
Nothing happened.

42:45.458 --> 42:46.542
I mean, that's a good thing,
right?

42:46.625 --> 42:48.500
Yeah, unless we just damaged
the display

42:48.583 --> 42:50.667
and the actual countdown
is still going.

42:50.750 --> 42:52.667
Well, we've got 20 seconds
to find out.

42:52.750 --> 42:54.000
It's probably a good time
to tell you

42:54.083 --> 42:55.333
that if we get out
of this alive,

42:55.417 --> 42:56.625
I'm kinda done with this life.

42:56.709 --> 42:58.333
There's my last words.

42:58.417 --> 43:01.667
This is not Russia,
and this is not me.

43:03.709 --> 43:06.166
And I know where Chetri is.

43:06.250 --> 43:08.291
Fucking asshole.

43:10.375 --> 43:13.917
Three... two...

43:34.458 --> 43:37.542
Is everyone okay?

43:37.625 --> 43:40.625
Define "okay," sir.

43:40.709 --> 43:42.375
Hassan is dead.

43:42.458 --> 43:44.542
The nuke got primed to blow.

43:44.625 --> 43:46.625
But don't worry, I shot it.

43:46.709 --> 43:48.375
S-sorry, you shot it?

43:48.458 --> 43:50.750
- Did that work?
- No, Mac, it didn't.

43:50.834 --> 43:52.041
It went off.

43:52.125 --> 43:53.291
You didn't hear it?

43:53.375 --> 43:56.583
Wow, to think I was worried
about you dickheads.

43:56.667 --> 43:57.959
Wait, where's Chetri?

43:58.041 --> 43:59.250
Zarkova.

43:59.333 --> 44:02.208
She said she knew where she was
and I let her go.

44:02.291 --> 44:04.125
And why the hell
didn't you go with her?

44:04.208 --> 44:06.417
I had to make a choice, sir.

44:06.500 --> 44:08.917
She was afraid of what Pavel
might do to Chetri

44:09.000 --> 44:11.333
if he saw me.

44:22.959 --> 44:26.125
It's okay, I'm here to help you.

44:26.208 --> 44:27.959
It's okay.

44:30.208 --> 44:32.083
No, it's not.

44:34.625 --> 44:37.083
You have no idea
what he's gonna do.

44:46.166 --> 44:47.625
Pavel?

44:47.709 --> 44:49.041
Katrina.

44:49.125 --> 44:53.000
I'm thinking you have
finally chosen a side.

44:53.083 --> 44:55.625
You were willing to kill me.

44:56.875 --> 44:59.625
I'm willing to do
what needs to be done.

45:01.291 --> 45:04.250
Pavel, listen to me.

45:04.333 --> 45:06.250
Whatever you are planning to do,

45:06.333 --> 45:09.125
you don't need to do this.

45:10.917 --> 45:12.959
We can still go home.

45:40.750 --> 45:43.166
Hello?

45:47.250 --> 45:49.500
Hello?

45:56.125 --> 45:58.917
What about Zarkova?

45:59.000 --> 46:02.625
Where do you think
her loyalties lie?

46:02.709 --> 46:05.083
- With her country.
- You sure of that?

46:05.166 --> 46:06.750
I think she's a good soldier
that's had a lot

46:06.834 --> 46:09.709
of very difficult decisions
to make.

46:09.792 --> 46:12.000
Sounds like someone
who has a crush.

46:13.875 --> 46:15.709
That's the second time
you've done that.

46:15.792 --> 46:19.542
The first was when you said
I had "an arrogance."

46:19.625 --> 46:22.458
Barely worth noticing,
but twice now.

46:22.542 --> 46:24.792
It's your sentence construction.

46:24.875 --> 46:26.583
It's almost like someone
who's learned English

46:26.667 --> 46:28.208
as a second language.

46:30.417 --> 46:32.875
Why am I here?

46:32.959 --> 46:34.375
Who are you, really?

46:34.458 --> 46:36.542
You're being absurd.

46:39.667 --> 46:41.417
One last time:
Who are you?

47:09.000 --> 47:11.583
Alexander!

47:13.834 --> 47:15.542
Alexander.

47:15.625 --> 47:18.250
They... they wanted
to find out about Pavel

47:18.333 --> 47:20.291
to corroborate my story.

47:20.375 --> 47:21.792
And who is "they"?

47:21.875 --> 47:24.417
Alpha Group? FSB?

47:24.500 --> 47:27.458
Let's just say...

47:27.542 --> 47:30.542
this goes higher up than that.

47:32.417 --> 47:34.792
They think that Pavel is trying
to force the West and Russia

47:34.875 --> 47:38.250
into a war
that neither side can avoid.

47:39.208 --> 47:41.875
And the feeling is that 20

47:41.959 --> 47:45.208
might be best placed
to stop him.

47:51.375 --> 47:53.250
I'm sorry, it's been a long day.

47:53.333 --> 47:55.333
Let me just get this straight:

47:55.417 --> 47:58.083
Russia's asking for our help?

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
Yes.

48:03.083 --> 48:04.875
We are.

48:04.959 --> 48:07.542
Welcome to Moscow, Colonel.

48:35.375 --> 48:37.709
