WEBVTT

03:18.107 --> 03:18.908
Don't move!

03:18.941 --> 03:19.741
Hands in the air!

03:19.775 --> 03:20.575
I said drop it!

03:47.065 --> 03:47.865
Clear!

03:47.899 --> 03:49.100
Check the side room,

03:49.133 --> 03:49.967
we're heading down
for Brooks, copy?

04:05.612 --> 04:07.048
Hands, show me your hands!

04:07.082 --> 04:08.116
Show me your hands, now!

04:08.149 --> 04:09.816
Don't fucking move!

04:14.421 --> 04:16.654
Damien Brooks,
you're under arrest.

04:16.688 --> 04:17.523
Yeah.

04:18.524 --> 04:19.559
Put the shit down.

04:19.591 --> 04:20.426
Let's go.

04:24.029 --> 04:24.930
And there he his.

04:31.302 --> 04:32.269
Look at you slip.

04:32.303 --> 04:34.070
Yeah, it looks that way.

04:34.104 --> 04:36.772
So this is where you've
been hiding, in plain sight?

04:37.841 --> 04:39.774
Well, I've been where
I've been sheriff,

04:41.110 --> 04:42.578
I've not been hiding.

04:42.610 --> 04:43.846
Right.

04:43.879 --> 04:46.247
And all the same for
the Sinaloa cartel?

04:46.280 --> 04:47.882
Yeah, me and El
Gordo are cool,

04:49.317 --> 04:53.253
but this ain't him,
it ain't me either.

04:53.286 --> 04:55.621
Look, I just came here
to pick me up some weed.

04:56.622 --> 04:57.456
Fuck you.

04:58.623 --> 05:01.427
I got you, possession
still puts you away.

05:02.660 --> 05:03.862
Not what you were
hoping for though.

05:03.895 --> 05:06.097
I'll see you in
about 10 years mate.

05:06.131 --> 05:07.499
Yeah, give or take.

05:08.466 --> 05:10.167
Get him out of my face.

05:12.136 --> 05:13.137
See you around sherif.

05:25.147 --> 05:28.681
At least four people are
confirmed dead tonight.

05:28.715 --> 05:32.620
One British national and
members of the Sinaloa cartel.

05:32.652 --> 05:35.455
Local sheriff under
investigation after a drug bust

05:35.488 --> 05:36.788
turns deadly.

05:36.823 --> 05:38.358
Sheriff Tucker,
can you tell me what

05:38.391 --> 05:41.059
happened here tonight,
Sheriff Tucker?

05:41.093 --> 05:43.794
New information tonight
as the has now placed

05:43.829 --> 05:46.197
sheriff William Tucker
on administrative leave

05:46.230 --> 05:48.299
pending an internal review,

05:48.332 --> 05:50.967
after he led a failed
raid on an alleged illegal

05:51.001 --> 05:52.402
marijuana operation.

05:52.435 --> 05:56.006
We'll have more details as
the story continues to unfold.

05:56.039 --> 05:58.374
Sheriff William Tucker has
officially been removed

05:58.407 --> 05:59.642
from office.

05:59.674 --> 06:01.143
Now his firing has
come under scrutiny

06:01.177 --> 06:03.744
by the governor's office
as sheriff deputies claimed

06:03.777 --> 06:07.215
the botched raid resulted
only in 10 pounds of marijuana

06:07.248 --> 06:09.349
and a handful of
illegal weapons.

06:09.383 --> 06:12.152
The deaths of three foreign
nationals took center stage

06:12.186 --> 06:15.254
as the leader, Damien
Brooks known as the Brit,

06:15.288 --> 06:17.823
has been sentenced to
five years for possession.

06:17.857 --> 06:21.860
William Tucker has declined
any comment on his behalf.

08:23.461 --> 08:24.796
Looking really good.

08:27.164 --> 08:31.268
Yeah baby, you pound that.

08:39.408 --> 08:40.509
Don't ignore me.

08:49.150 --> 08:50.950
I know you can hear me.

08:50.984 --> 08:52.152
Did you saw something?

08:53.486 --> 08:55.055
Come lotion me up.

08:55.088 --> 08:57.289
Can I literally get a
workout in without you asking

08:57.323 --> 08:58.691
for something?

08:58.724 --> 09:01.994
Uh, can I get something
before you getting a workout in?

09:02.027 --> 09:03.094
Don't start girl.

09:05.830 --> 09:06.799
Forget it.

09:12.002 --> 09:12.969
Yeah.

09:13.003 --> 09:14.637
Hey, don't yeah at me.

09:14.670 --> 09:15.806
Who's this?

09:15.838 --> 09:17.139
Who do you
think it is? Your daddy.

09:17.173 --> 09:19.141
Fuck off, what do you want?

09:19.175 --> 09:20.209
Where's your girl?

09:20.242 --> 09:22.344
Doing Jack shit as usual.

09:22.377 --> 09:23.678
Get her on too.

09:23.712 --> 09:24.814
Psst!

09:34.721 --> 09:36.389
All right, we're both on.

09:36.422 --> 09:38.590
The babe and the bad ass,

09:38.623 --> 09:41.360
you know, I kinda feel
it in my nut sack.

09:41.393 --> 09:43.695
Uh, you wish baby.

09:43.729 --> 09:45.896
- Are we on?
- We're on.

09:45.930 --> 09:47.398
So what's the plan?

09:47.431 --> 09:49.835
Our boy from London just
got out a few hours ago

09:49.867 --> 09:52.435
and we're coordinating a
little meet up with him.

09:52.469 --> 09:54.404
I'll text you once
I know what's what.

09:54.437 --> 09:56.005
I have to find that
pain in the ass,

09:56.039 --> 09:58.006
you know who I'm talking about.

09:58.040 --> 10:00.275
I'll ring him in and get
him back on the job for us.

10:00.309 --> 10:01.744
The brains.

10:01.778 --> 10:05.113
He's probably tripping balls
on some Ayahuasca retreat

10:05.146 --> 10:06.381
in Peru.

10:06.414 --> 10:09.282
The brains, shit, he's
high as fuck right now

10:09.316 --> 10:11.451
and you're going to have
to sober him up enough

10:11.485 --> 10:14.254
to walk straight, much less
do what he has to do for real.

10:14.287 --> 10:16.222
Yeah, I'll handle him.

10:16.255 --> 10:17.556
You two just stay on ice.

11:01.527 --> 11:03.628
My friend, proud papa,

11:03.661 --> 11:05.831
his little girl is
about to become DA.

11:07.298 --> 11:10.167
To your boy, they're making
us feel real old, don't they?

11:10.200 --> 11:11.034
Salute.

11:13.771 --> 11:15.104
Time is the enemy, right?

11:17.673 --> 11:18.909
- What you did.
- I didn't do nothing.

11:18.941 --> 11:20.608
You're the only one
that did a damn thing

11:21.609 --> 11:23.813
and I know the price you paid.

11:23.846 --> 11:25.980
Those two DEA fucks deserve
every inch of the beat down

11:26.014 --> 11:26.947
you gave them.

11:27.816 --> 11:28.949
Would you stop?

11:28.982 --> 11:30.017
I only wish it
hadn't cost you career.

11:30.050 --> 11:31.985
Yeah well, it ain't over.

11:33.152 --> 11:34.287
You know what today is?

11:35.688 --> 11:37.825
Today's the day that goddamed
chicken flies the coop.

11:37.858 --> 11:38.690
I caught him.

11:39.958 --> 11:41.293
Brit?

11:41.326 --> 11:42.160
Yep.

11:44.863 --> 11:45.996
I'm gonna do it again.

11:47.131 --> 11:47.965
Redemption.

11:50.633 --> 11:51.468
Bill.

11:54.137 --> 11:54.971
Bill?

12:00.242 --> 12:01.043
I gotta go.

12:01.076 --> 12:02.277
Tucker?

12:02.310 --> 12:03.311
Where are you going?

12:03.344 --> 12:05.346
To work, I'll be back relax.

13:18.207 --> 13:20.776
The water's hot,
the toilet works,

13:20.809 --> 13:22.912
sorry this isn't the Ritz.

13:22.945 --> 13:24.980
No, this is, uh, this is good.

13:27.381 --> 13:28.415
These for me?

13:28.448 --> 13:29.383
Don't lose them.

13:34.654 --> 13:36.055
Do you have any
questions for me?

13:36.088 --> 13:38.223
Are we clear on your curfew
and our meeting times?

13:38.256 --> 13:43.261
- Yes ma'am.
- Good.

13:44.728 --> 13:46.865
You know I got myself a
new pager, look at that.

13:46.898 --> 13:48.399
Basically.

13:48.432 --> 13:51.534
Okay so, in by sundown, we set
you up with a few interviews

13:51.568 --> 13:53.737
to get you integrated
back into the system.

13:55.572 --> 13:58.440
Everything you need is in
here along with a bus pass

13:58.473 --> 14:00.576
and address of where
you need to go.

14:00.609 --> 14:03.277
Now, you did time for weed
and weed is legal now,

14:03.311 --> 14:05.747
so it's a little tricky.

14:05.781 --> 14:07.615
We won't be on you as if you
had smuggled kilos of heroin

14:07.648 --> 14:09.115
or Coke but nonetheless,
the law is the law

14:09.149 --> 14:10.818
and I gotta do my job.

14:10.851 --> 14:13.921
So don't be a in my ass and I
won't be pain in yours, copy?

14:14.854 --> 14:15.688
Yes ma'am.

14:18.290 --> 14:19.592
Happy about the TV though.

14:21.026 --> 14:24.395
There's no cable, but
it comes with a fire stick

14:24.429 --> 14:26.798
and the WiFi is
decent, you'll survive.

14:26.831 --> 14:30.601
Just stay out of trouble Brooks,
and stop calling me ma'am.

14:34.470 --> 14:35.304
Layla.

14:36.472 --> 14:37.573
What?

14:37.607 --> 14:38.774
What's a fire stick?

14:40.342 --> 14:42.078
You'll figure it out.

15:21.076 --> 15:22.811
Hey Jeff.

15:22.845 --> 15:23.979
Here's your coffee.

15:24.013 --> 15:24.947
Thank you.

15:24.980 --> 15:26.380
You wanna take it for a ride?

15:26.413 --> 15:27.882
Yeah.

15:27.915 --> 15:30.617
Hey baby, hook your uncle
up with some vegan eggs.

15:30.651 --> 15:31.551
On it babe.

15:31.585 --> 15:32.518
Cool, I'm going to meditate.

15:32.551 --> 15:34.286
Hey girly, how are you?

15:34.320 --> 15:36.622
Hey cute girl, it's
so good to see you.

15:36.656 --> 15:38.490
Want some of my vegan eggs?

15:38.523 --> 15:40.358
Yeah like, I don't even
know how they make them

15:40.392 --> 15:43.062
but they're yum, so yummy.

15:47.564 --> 15:50.500
Oh Paulo, got up soon and
I accept your sweet kisses.

15:50.533 --> 15:52.770
What the fuck
was all that about?

16:00.208 --> 16:02.243
You're really here, Tony.

16:02.276 --> 16:03.511
Yeah, I'm really here.

16:05.747 --> 16:07.883
Oh, this is good,

16:07.916 --> 16:09.382
this is good, come on.

16:10.350 --> 16:11.518
And they're here too.

16:12.953 --> 16:14.154
The vortex.

16:14.186 --> 16:15.822
We're all here,
Cici, bring it in.

16:15.855 --> 16:17.423
Fuck off.

16:17.456 --> 16:19.658
Told you he'd be fucked up.

16:19.692 --> 16:23.327
Jeff, you gotta come with us.

16:23.361 --> 16:24.763
All right man, whatever dude.

16:24.797 --> 16:25.998
Can we have some eggs first?

16:26.030 --> 16:28.699
Baby, put some more
vegan eggs on the grill.

16:28.733 --> 16:30.701
It's not eggs,
shit's going down.

16:32.401 --> 16:33.335
Right here?

16:33.369 --> 16:34.838
Shit's gonna go down right here,

16:34.871 --> 16:37.741
little group love session?
All right, I think they're in.

16:37.774 --> 16:40.876
Ew, gross, fuck no.

16:40.910 --> 16:42.745
The Brit's here and
we have to rendezvous,

16:42.778 --> 16:47.716
so clean up and whatever,
we gotta go, now,

16:48.883 --> 16:50.349
Always the bossy
one, aren't you Janel?

16:50.383 --> 16:51.719
And a hot one.

16:51.752 --> 16:53.386
Now get dressed, let's roll.

16:58.091 --> 16:59.591
Don't tell anybody.

16:59.624 --> 17:01.761
but I think I projected
this, this moment.

17:02.961 --> 17:04.896
I don't know what
the fuck that means.

17:05.964 --> 17:07.165
But it's good to see you.

17:08.298 --> 17:10.567
Hey, how'd you
even find me anyways?

17:10.599 --> 17:11.434
This story.

17:12.770 --> 17:14.904
I gotta really stop
posting on social media, man.

17:14.938 --> 17:16.071
You're supposed
to be the brains,

17:16.106 --> 17:17.439
you fucking suck at this.

17:18.640 --> 17:20.374
You're not worried
about the cartels?

17:20.407 --> 17:22.176
They wanna cut your
fucking head off

17:23.178 --> 17:24.213
It wasn't my fault.

17:48.599 --> 17:50.299
You like the dirty
white boys, don't you?

17:50.333 --> 17:51.168
Shut up.

17:59.374 --> 18:02.811
You're in the wrong
hood, motherfucker.

18:04.212 --> 18:05.279
Stop, Kuko!

18:08.281 --> 18:09.116
Come on!

18:10.017 --> 18:11.118
Come on, man!

18:14.386 --> 18:15.755
Stop Kuko, don't do this!

18:15.789 --> 18:17.356
You don't have to do this

18:17.389 --> 18:18.191
Where's the Brit?

18:18.224 --> 18:19.491
I don't know, man.

18:19.525 --> 18:21.160
- Where is he?
- I said, I don't know man.

18:21.193 --> 18:22.627
Fuck, I don't know shit.

18:22.660 --> 18:24.495
I don't know anything, I don't
fucking keep tabs on him.

18:24.529 --> 18:25.764
You piece of shit,

18:25.798 --> 18:27.265
don't think you can
fuck with the cartel

18:27.297 --> 18:28.298
I was just trying to
fuck your sister, I swear.

18:28.331 --> 18:29.432
I mean, I was not...

18:29.466 --> 18:30.868
You're dead.

18:30.902 --> 18:31.935
Oh fuck, come on please
don't fucking kill me.

18:33.036 --> 18:34.537
Relax all of you, relax!

18:34.570 --> 18:36.773
Relax, relax, relax, everybody
relax, we're getting our boy.

18:36.807 --> 18:38.640
Be cool, back up.

18:38.673 --> 18:40.675
Give me the frat boy,
that's it. Get up boy.

18:40.709 --> 18:42.443
You've got some balls.

18:42.477 --> 18:45.479
El Gordo heard about the
move you made on his shit.

18:45.512 --> 18:47.115
Well, that's strange, cause
I didn't make any moves.

18:47.148 --> 18:48.649
Yeah right, ese.

18:48.682 --> 18:50.217
Then we hear one of
your boys in the hood

18:50.250 --> 18:52.052
fucking with one of our own.

18:52.085 --> 18:53.452
Yeah, okay.

18:53.486 --> 18:56.889
Well, mate think about
it. love is love.

18:56.923 --> 18:58.024
Fuck you.

18:58.057 --> 18:59.491
Well, this is unnecessary.

19:00.559 --> 19:01.794
Let's calm this thing
down, should we?

19:01.828 --> 19:02.994
Bring it down, come on.

19:06.031 --> 19:08.132
You really wanna shoot
fucking holes in each other

19:08.165 --> 19:09.399
over a chick.

19:09.432 --> 19:12.002
That chick is one of
El Gordo's daughters.

19:12.036 --> 19:13.670
Nice job, fuck face.

19:13.704 --> 19:14.503
I couldn't hold myself.

19:14.536 --> 19:15.805
Yeah, of course.

19:15.839 --> 19:17.307
Well, you know that
does change things.

19:17.339 --> 19:19.374
But it ain't about her,
ese, this is about the money

19:19.408 --> 19:20.909
that never made it to the DEA.

19:22.343 --> 19:24.213
I have no fucking clue
what you're talking about,

19:25.280 --> 19:27.048
but I do respect the situation.

19:28.448 --> 19:30.584
Tell El Gordo, that we...

19:30.617 --> 19:31.451
Hey,

19:32.551 --> 19:33.385
easy man.

19:39.258 --> 19:41.260
It's okay bro, it's cool.

19:41.293 --> 19:42.728
I know it's cool.

19:42.761 --> 19:43.862
We're leaving now, please tell
them to put the guns down.

19:43.895 --> 19:45.330
Fuck you.

19:45.362 --> 19:46.998
Put the fucking guns down!

19:47.031 --> 19:48.432
Fuck that shit.

19:48.465 --> 19:50.234
What's up ese?

19:59.275 --> 20:00.375
Put 'em down.

20:03.778 --> 20:05.046
On the floor.

20:08.381 --> 20:09.549
Uh uh, baby.

20:13.453 --> 20:14.620
We're leaving now.

20:15.487 --> 20:16.890
Have a good night gentlemen.

20:21.492 --> 20:23.228
Let's get these motherfuckers!

20:28.565 --> 20:29.700
Let's go!

20:29.734 --> 20:31.202
Get it moving, Cici.

20:32.903 --> 20:34.738
Move that ass, Brit.

20:37.606 --> 20:38.807
Get it moving Cici, go!

20:47.581 --> 20:49.950
Come on, let's
have some vegan eggs.

20:49.983 --> 20:51.985
Baby, put some more
eggs on the barby.

21:15.371 --> 21:16.638
Nice.

21:16.673 --> 21:18.741
You know, your swing's
getting better, Leo.

21:18.775 --> 21:20.242
Yeah, what would you know?

21:20.275 --> 21:21.743
You hate golf.

21:21.777 --> 21:24.913
I don't hate golf, cause
I'm just not old enough

21:24.947 --> 21:26.579
or bored enough to play it.

21:26.613 --> 21:28.249
Or rich enough.

21:28.282 --> 21:30.751
Well, I guess that's
why we are here, right?

21:30.785 --> 21:31.618
That's right.

21:32.786 --> 21:36.189
So you uh, ready to play
the back nine with me?

21:37.324 --> 21:39.524
Call's been made,
all confirmed.

21:39.557 --> 21:41.459
Got your caddies lined up?

21:41.492 --> 21:42.962
Mh-mmh

21:42.995 --> 21:43.828
Good.

21:44.996 --> 21:47.464
Oh Leo, come on, you
can do better than that.

21:47.497 --> 21:48.833
You're making me nervous.

21:50.734 --> 21:53.303
I tell you what, you
meet me at the club house

21:54.237 --> 21:55.805
and we'll see what's what.

21:57.306 --> 21:58.341
Sounds like a plan.

21:59.875 --> 22:00.776
There you go.

22:00.810 --> 22:02.110
How's business?

22:02.143 --> 22:03.610
Business?

22:03.644 --> 22:05.914
Business is great, trust me.

22:09.984 --> 22:11.352
Look at that.

22:11.385 --> 22:12.552
Well, I see your swing's
getting better Leo.

22:12.585 --> 22:13.420
Thanks.

22:15.554 --> 22:16.389
Hey,

22:18.490 --> 22:19.558
it's great to see you.

22:20.993 --> 22:21.827
Game time.

22:27.098 --> 22:28.666
That's beautiful.

22:42.745 --> 22:44.979
Dude, what were you thinking
banging that cartel chick?

22:45.013 --> 22:48.816
I was thinking about love
and ecstasy and coitus.

22:48.850 --> 22:51.885
Look man, she came on to
me, I just merely obliged.

22:51.918 --> 22:54.553
Obliged, you two
are some dumb asses.

22:54.587 --> 22:57.089
You should change your names,

22:57.123 --> 22:59.358
brawns and brains, get
the fuck outta here.

23:00.393 --> 23:01.227
He's late.

23:02.193 --> 23:03.661
Doesn't he have a curfew now?

23:03.695 --> 23:05.562
Like they got him an ankle
bracelet and all that, right?

23:05.596 --> 23:08.032
He can hack into anything
with a circuit board.

23:08.065 --> 23:09.366
That's him right there.

23:13.070 --> 23:14.504
Hey, how do you
think he got the ride?

23:14.536 --> 23:16.873
Is there like a prison ride
share app or something?

23:16.906 --> 23:18.841
No man, he's out of the
joint for five minutes,

23:18.875 --> 23:19.975
and he got a free ride.

23:23.577 --> 23:25.780
Holy fucking shit.

23:25.813 --> 23:26.613
Good to see you brother.

23:26.647 --> 23:27.715
You look good.

23:27.748 --> 23:29.582
You too, buddy.

23:29.616 --> 23:30.550
Good to see you.

23:31.584 --> 23:32.685
Mr. Bentley.

23:32.719 --> 23:33.820
Mr. Brooks.

23:36.723 --> 23:37.622
How you doing?

23:37.656 --> 23:39.058
Good to see you brother.

23:39.091 --> 23:41.393
Come, bring your mama sugar.

23:41.427 --> 23:44.028
Hey, that's mine,
cool it now buddy.

23:44.062 --> 23:45.730
Get your hands off my girl.

23:46.630 --> 23:48.533
Wait, you guys
are an item now?

23:48.565 --> 23:49.534
Mh-mmh.

23:49.566 --> 23:50.901
Going on three years.

23:50.934 --> 23:53.804
She's a pain in the
ass, but I love her.

23:53.837 --> 23:54.938
Love you too, babe.

23:54.971 --> 23:56.038
Cool.

23:56.072 --> 23:58.240
Come on, I missed you.

23:58.274 --> 23:59.607
Good to see you.

24:01.575 --> 24:02.877
So guys we all know
that prison sucks,

24:02.911 --> 24:05.480
so we can bypass any
more asking that stuff.

24:07.348 --> 24:08.882
You're about to
become millionaires.

24:08.916 --> 24:09.917
Yeah!

24:11.418 --> 24:12.252
Fucking A,

24:12.286 --> 24:13.353
show us where to dig.

24:15.154 --> 24:17.390
It's game time
ladies and gents.

24:17.423 --> 24:18.257
Game time.

24:22.461 --> 24:24.096
We always knew it was
going to take a load of years

24:24.129 --> 24:25.464
to shake up the entire system.

24:25.497 --> 24:29.066
But with the DEA shattering
and us fucking up

24:29.100 --> 24:30.501
the entire cartel network,

24:30.534 --> 24:32.936
they do not have the
juice they used to have.

24:32.969 --> 24:34.971
That's where our strength lies.

24:35.004 --> 24:37.906
El Gordo's underground, that
whole syndicate's disbanded.

24:37.940 --> 24:41.176
Maybe a few of his ex
guys and sheriff Tucker,

24:41.210 --> 24:42.077
he was onto us.

24:42.111 --> 24:43.512
For a minute.

24:43.544 --> 24:45.012
But now people would
rather Twitter their balls

24:45.046 --> 24:47.248
than doing a Google search
looking for another legend.

24:47.281 --> 24:48.149
You've been searching, right?

24:48.182 --> 24:49.516
Anything on the Sinaloa case?

24:49.549 --> 24:51.585
Not really, other than
some kid in El Centro

24:51.617 --> 24:53.019
doing research papers.

24:54.521 --> 24:55.754
That's what I'm talking
about right there.

24:55.788 --> 24:57.823
Then what are we waiting for?

24:57.857 --> 24:59.325
Let's get what we've
been waiting for,

24:59.358 --> 25:02.360
cause I am sick of
this influencer shit.

25:02.393 --> 25:04.696
We need our real cash, now.

25:07.664 --> 25:09.032
What the fuck man, I'm
I missing something?

25:09.066 --> 25:10.634
What's an influencer?

25:11.702 --> 25:13.703
You see that ass?

25:13.736 --> 25:15.438
She throws on a bikini
and takes a selfie

25:15.471 --> 25:18.107
with some get skinny
milkshake and boom,

25:18.141 --> 25:19.774
they send us $5000 a month.

25:19.808 --> 25:20.775
All right, here we go.

25:20.809 --> 25:22.043
Think skinny,

25:22.077 --> 25:23.111
Aha.

25:23.145 --> 25:23.979
No, uh uh.

25:24.012 --> 25:25.280
Boobs.

25:25.313 --> 25:26.614
Hold the bottle up.

25:26.647 --> 25:27.515
Yes, that's it.

25:27.548 --> 25:28.782
Think skinny.

25:28.816 --> 25:30.184
I fucking am asshole.

25:30.217 --> 25:32.118
But suck it in
though, suck it in.

25:32.152 --> 25:33.786
Now give me some ass.

25:33.820 --> 25:36.489
Aha, that's it.

25:39.591 --> 25:40.627
What?

25:40.659 --> 25:41.793
Yeah.

25:41.827 --> 25:43.295
Serious.

25:43.328 --> 25:44.462
Hang on man, I've only been
gone for five fucking minutes,

25:44.495 --> 25:45.329
what happened?

25:46.664 --> 25:49.333
I believe that we fractured
our space time dimension

25:49.367 --> 25:52.035
into an alternate reality
where the collective of self

25:52.068 --> 25:54.738
and society has
shifted the influence,

25:54.771 --> 25:56.539
thus creating the current
universe we're in.

25:56.572 --> 25:58.307
And let me tell you,
bro, it's not a good one.

25:58.340 --> 25:59.441
Ain't that the truth?

26:00.876 --> 26:04.345
I believe that shit, ancient
aliens, Prometheus, area 51,

26:04.379 --> 26:06.414
the vortex, that shit's real.

26:07.681 --> 26:08.616
The vortex.

26:09.750 --> 26:11.151
We watch a lot
of history channel.

26:11.185 --> 26:14.187
No way, it's fucking
bullshit man.

26:14.220 --> 26:15.656
That's 100% true.

26:15.688 --> 26:17.223
No, absolutely not.

26:17.256 --> 26:18.524
Not true, bullshit.

26:19.524 --> 26:21.693
Garbage, that's fiction, bro.

26:21.726 --> 26:23.395
That technology did not exist.

26:24.729 --> 26:27.198
No, it didn't, the
fucking oninaki came down,

26:27.231 --> 26:30.434
gave the caveman laser beams
so they can cut that stone.

26:30.467 --> 26:31.868
Look at how perfect that is.

26:33.136 --> 26:34.737
Wait a minute, let
me get this straight.

26:34.771 --> 26:38.240
You think fucking space fairy
creatures just came down

26:38.273 --> 26:41.944
to earth and handed out
laser swords to homo erectus.

26:41.977 --> 26:44.011
Yes I do, and what the
fuck are you laughing at?

26:44.045 --> 26:46.347
What's so funny, that's science.

26:46.380 --> 26:47.548
Crystals?

26:47.582 --> 26:48.783
- Crystals turn...
- The more the better.

26:49.950 --> 26:52.519
Damien, just tell us
our next move, babe.

26:52.552 --> 26:55.689
Let's get our cash and get
the hell out of this country.

26:55.721 --> 26:57.624
Yeah, I love to
hear that, love

27:00.125 --> 27:02.527
So here's how it's
gonna go down.

27:02.560 --> 27:04.362
So I'm assuming these
are up to date, yeah?

27:04.395 --> 27:05.964
Yeah, give or take
a couple of weeks.

27:05.997 --> 27:07.965
Just shut your fucking fluff.

27:09.132 --> 27:11.201
Here we go, I've been
looking forward to this.

27:11.235 --> 27:13.136
There you go, one
for you lovely lady,

27:14.070 --> 27:15.271
and there's a couple for you.

27:15.304 --> 27:17.373
You are going to have to
get to know these guys.

27:17.406 --> 27:19.808
Both of them are douche
bags, early retirement

27:19.841 --> 27:22.310
after the Sinaloa bust went bad.

27:22.344 --> 27:24.714
Killed three kids
between them on duty.

27:24.746 --> 27:25.980
Word in the street from my guys

27:26.013 --> 27:26.914
is at they're still at homeless

27:26.947 --> 27:28.349
just hanging out at the same bar

27:30.784 --> 27:32.952
here in Coachella, right there.

27:35.521 --> 27:36.923
Can't wait, right?

27:36.956 --> 27:38.257
Circle jerk time.

27:39.626 --> 27:40.559
These are guys who couldn't
possibly get drunk enough

27:40.592 --> 27:42.294
to take or go home with them,

27:42.327 --> 27:43.894
they'd be onto us in a snap.

27:43.928 --> 27:45.930
We'll get creative,
don't worry.

27:45.963 --> 27:47.265
No doubt about that.

27:47.298 --> 27:48.132
You jealous?

27:48.165 --> 27:49.332
Tiny bit.

27:49.366 --> 27:51.968
You the only dick I ever had.

27:52.002 --> 27:54.904
Now that's the kind of
stuff that makes me miss you.

27:54.938 --> 27:56.905
Okay, what about us?

27:56.939 --> 27:59.609
That's easy, I need you
guys to break into the old DEA

27:59.643 --> 28:01.076
storage warehouse.

28:01.110 --> 28:03.444
Get your hands on the hard
drive and the trash bag logs,

28:03.478 --> 28:05.313
you know, from my old bust.

28:05.346 --> 28:06.848
Check.

28:06.881 --> 28:08.982
I wasn't going to
make it easy for them.

28:09.016 --> 28:12.119
There's no way I was going
to let them find $33 million

28:12.152 --> 28:14.320
in the desert in the
middle of nowhere.

28:14.353 --> 28:15.788
You're a genius, man.

28:15.821 --> 28:17.758
You couldn't even have told
them if you'd wanted to.

28:17.790 --> 28:20.492
No that's what, what makes
them thirsty you know.

28:21.694 --> 28:22.961
Human firewall.

28:24.329 --> 28:29.333
So, we hack the
mainframe's database,

28:30.067 --> 28:30.968
some shit like that.

28:31.868 --> 28:33.303
And then we pull that shit out

28:33.336 --> 28:35.538
and we put it on a floppy disk.

28:35.571 --> 28:38.273
Yeah, a floppy disk, and then
we'll get in a time machine

28:38.307 --> 28:41.644
and go back to 1987 and
put it into an old computer

28:41.678 --> 28:44.545
in my sister's room and drink
Tang and watch scary movies.

28:44.578 --> 28:45.846
What is wrong with you?

28:45.880 --> 28:47.114
Maybe we'll go look
for a pot of gold

28:47.148 --> 28:48.015
you leprechaun motherfucker.

28:48.049 --> 28:48.849
Fucking dick warts

28:48.883 --> 28:49.717
Ladies.

28:51.151 --> 28:54.655
Yo, you have 48 hours to
pull this off from report.

28:56.322 --> 28:57.256
Clocks ticking.

29:00.092 --> 29:01.959
Oh yeah, I forgot.

29:01.993 --> 29:04.630
I don't have a motor,
who's taking me home?

29:04.663 --> 29:05.830
I got it.

29:05.863 --> 29:07.732
Hey, I don't have
a motor either.

29:07.765 --> 29:09.132
Fuck you, Jeff.

29:09.166 --> 29:10.534
Can I, I gotta go with them.

29:12.369 --> 29:13.203
Bye.

29:26.681 --> 29:27.848
Same old Jeff.

29:30.951 --> 29:32.686
He's like a
fucking 12 year old.

29:33.687 --> 29:34.688
12 year old stoner.

29:37.590 --> 29:39.891
So what's up with
you man, you good?

29:42.227 --> 29:43.095
Yeah, I'm okay.

29:44.095 --> 29:44.929
Really?

29:46.631 --> 29:48.600
Yeah, I'm doing all right.

29:48.633 --> 29:50.867
Look, I know
you're zan as fuck,

29:50.900 --> 29:55.571
you are always very chill, but
Jesus, 6 years in the joint.

29:58.040 --> 30:00.677
Well, a perfect heist takes
time, straight ahead buddy.

30:00.710 --> 30:02.410
All these desert roads
look the fucking same.

30:02.443 --> 30:03.277
Yeah, they do.

30:05.413 --> 30:06.849
Look,

30:06.881 --> 30:10.183
I'm not the guy to question
how you put all this together.

30:10.217 --> 30:13.620
Honestly, man, like the ins
and outs kinda hurts my brain

30:13.653 --> 30:15.221
when I think about it,

30:16.322 --> 30:18.557
but I need that
money and I'm here.

30:20.593 --> 30:22.961
What are you going to do
while we're doing out there?

30:22.994 --> 30:24.362
Me?

30:24.396 --> 30:25.396
I've gotta get a job.

30:26.563 --> 30:29.199
Like a person,
like a real job job?

30:30.267 --> 30:32.101
Yeah, one of those.

30:32.135 --> 30:33.436
Mate, I'm on parole.

30:35.004 --> 30:36.272
I gotta get a 9-5.

30:38.407 --> 30:39.241
Right.

30:40.442 --> 30:43.477
Like I said, a perfect
heist takes time, right?

30:43.511 --> 30:45.079
You should take
a left hand turn.

30:45.112 --> 30:47.783
When we get there, you drop
me around the corner, okay?

30:47.816 --> 30:49.482
I'm being watched.

30:49.516 --> 30:50.450
No shit.

30:50.483 --> 30:51.317
Yeah.

31:08.932 --> 31:10.066
Shit.

31:33.687 --> 31:36.456
Here you go,
god bless you man.

31:45.362 --> 31:46.964
Did this guy just
give you money?

31:46.997 --> 31:47.965
Yeah, he did.

31:49.299 --> 31:51.635
- And you took it.
- I did.

31:51.669 --> 31:52.502
Thanks.

31:56.138 --> 31:57.640
It's a nice day.

31:58.641 --> 32:00.175
Really?

32:00.209 --> 32:01.209
Yeah, look around.

32:02.243 --> 32:03.077
Dad.

32:03.978 --> 32:05.546
Would you stop?

32:05.581 --> 32:08.248
I'm fine, just
been working late.

32:10.818 --> 32:11.652
You're working?

32:13.185 --> 32:14.053
You're retired.

32:15.321 --> 32:16.823
They retired you.

32:17.691 --> 32:18.524
Uh-hum.

32:20.860 --> 32:22.962
Honestly, we're
worried about you.

32:22.994 --> 32:23.796
Who's we?

32:23.829 --> 32:24.897
Me and mom, obviously.

32:29.500 --> 32:30.835
I'm not saying anything.

32:30.869 --> 32:32.569
Well, your face
says everything.

32:35.672 --> 32:37.506
Cut her a break,
that guy's harmless.

32:38.908 --> 32:40.643
Okay look, I would
really, really love it

32:40.676 --> 32:43.143
if you would come tomorrow,
when they swear me in.

32:43.177 --> 32:44.713
I will, sure.

32:44.746 --> 32:47.014
Yes, mom will be there
and he'll be there,

32:47.949 --> 32:49.683
but you're my dad.

32:51.417 --> 32:53.152
You'll always be my dad,
no matter how shitty

32:53.186 --> 32:54.087
your life becomes.

32:55.722 --> 32:58.925
My kid, District Attorney.

32:58.958 --> 33:00.225
I get it from my daddy.

33:02.360 --> 33:03.194
Okay.

33:08.298 --> 33:09.667
Oh, I gotta go.

33:09.700 --> 33:11.101
I love you.

33:11.134 --> 33:11.969
Take a shower.

33:14.638 --> 33:15.471
Bye DA.

33:23.044 --> 33:24.512
But would you take it?

33:24.547 --> 33:27.015
You can't just walk out
of an interview like that

33:27.047 --> 33:28.683
Well, when you've been
the recipient of disrespect

33:28.716 --> 33:31.384
like that I would wonder if
there is a law against it.

33:31.417 --> 33:33.185
You just need a job, Damien.

33:33.219 --> 33:34.788
I know, but this aint it.

33:35.989 --> 33:36.823
Sorry.

33:50.801 --> 33:52.636
No, absolutely not.

33:54.738 --> 33:55.738
That's a lot...

33:55.772 --> 33:57.006
Hold on, one second.

33:59.742 --> 34:02.343
You ever fired a gun in
combat, actual line of duty?

34:04.646 --> 34:06.582
You guys carry?

34:06.615 --> 34:09.717
No, we don't, but I'm
just curious about you.

34:09.750 --> 34:10.918
You know, just in case.

34:12.118 --> 34:14.219
I mean, just in
case I fired a weapon

34:14.253 --> 34:15.755
some point in my life.

34:15.789 --> 34:17.489
Yeah, you don't
follow well, do you?

34:17.523 --> 34:20.291
Yeah, that's what my mother
always used to tell me.

34:20.324 --> 34:22.260
Your mom said that? Well,
let me tell you something here.

34:22.293 --> 34:23.728
When you're out in
the field in combat,

34:23.762 --> 34:25.996
mom's not gonna have your
back, so that's why I'm asking

34:26.030 --> 34:26.931
Yeah.

34:26.965 --> 34:28.165
It gets real out there.

34:28.197 --> 34:29.433
I know you're thinking,
no it's a mini course,

34:29.466 --> 34:30.934
gotta be safe, I
bring my family here,

34:30.967 --> 34:32.936
but I'm telling you right now,
that down by the ninth hole,

34:32.969 --> 34:34.938
some crazy shit goes down.

34:36.672 --> 34:39.909
It's cool, I just don't see
the relevance, if I'm honest,

34:39.942 --> 34:41.242
You don't see the what?

34:41.275 --> 34:42.177
Relevance.

34:42.210 --> 34:43.344
The relevance?

34:43.377 --> 34:44.746
Relevance.

34:44.779 --> 34:46.781
Relevance, there is
absolutely none of that required

34:46.815 --> 34:48.181
for the job.

34:48.215 --> 34:50.985
We have no relevance.

34:51.851 --> 34:52.987
I see that.

34:53.020 --> 34:55.520
Thank you.

34:56.388 --> 34:57.790
Have a lovely, will you?

35:05.964 --> 35:07.965
Damien, what the hell?

35:09.366 --> 35:11.802
I mean look, this
guy, mini-golf?

35:11.836 --> 35:14.537
I mean, it's funny but
kind of a waste of time.

35:14.571 --> 35:16.806
Can I just set up
some SAB's myself?

35:18.541 --> 35:22.443
Okay fine, but it
has to be approved.

35:22.477 --> 35:23.311
That's fair.

35:24.580 --> 35:26.380
Can I get some air?

35:26.413 --> 35:27.548
Go.

35:28.482 --> 35:29.684
Goodness.

35:45.697 --> 35:47.032
Well, I don't understand
what you're so mad about.

35:53.537 --> 35:55.504
Are you talking
about that waitress?

35:55.538 --> 35:57.840
Is this about the waitress?

35:59.676 --> 36:00.743
Leo.

36:00.777 --> 36:02.510
Mr. Brooks.

36:02.544 --> 36:04.880
Look what you've done to
the place, it look nice.

36:04.913 --> 36:06.347
Thank you.

36:06.380 --> 36:08.415
We're opening up another one
in may, we're really expanding.

36:08.448 --> 36:10.084
I'd really liked you
to be part of my team.

36:10.117 --> 36:13.318
Well, I'd like that very
much, pleased you considered me.

36:13.352 --> 36:15.387
Wait a second, this
is the parole officer?

36:15.421 --> 36:18.991
I'm sorry, did you get lost
looking for our model search?

36:19.024 --> 36:20.159
Joking, joking.

36:20.191 --> 36:21.192
Leo Cap.

36:21.225 --> 36:22.828
Layla Lopez.

36:22.861 --> 36:25.096
I'm here to make sure
Damien gets a job.

36:25.129 --> 36:27.397
He says that you might be
the guy who might be able

36:27.431 --> 36:28.833
to take a chance on him.

36:28.866 --> 36:30.601
Well, we are in the
business of taking chances,

36:30.635 --> 36:31.768
Miss Layla.

36:31.802 --> 36:33.070
It's just Layla.

36:33.103 --> 36:34.738
Okay, Layla, okay.

36:34.771 --> 36:37.505
This is Francesca, she's
my VP of public relations.

36:37.540 --> 36:39.407
And she'll be taking care
of him, watching over him

36:39.441 --> 36:40.676
while he's working.

36:40.710 --> 36:43.011
We'll take you up to
his new office, okay?

36:43.044 --> 36:44.145
Can't wait to see

36:48.783 --> 36:49.616
This is it.

36:50.718 --> 36:52.351
This is what?

36:52.385 --> 36:53.921
Damien's new office.

36:53.954 --> 36:54.787
Wait, what?

36:56.221 --> 36:57.890
This is bullshit.

36:57.924 --> 36:59.391
No, I assure you it's not.

36:59.424 --> 37:01.693
Mr. Brooks will monitoring
and filtering scam artists,

37:01.727 --> 37:04.062
they're constantly
bombarding this casino.

37:04.096 --> 37:07.531
From up here, he's secure and
way from any cash handling

37:07.565 --> 37:09.900
or any real floor activity.

37:09.934 --> 37:13.737
Zero interaction with any
of the dealers or cashiers,

37:13.770 --> 37:16.371
he sees something suspicious,
he calls it in on the walkie

37:16.405 --> 37:19.575
and basically he's my
eagle eye in the sky.

37:20.743 --> 37:23.112
And provided he can pass
a standard drug test,

37:23.145 --> 37:24.646
he can start work tomorrow.

37:24.680 --> 37:27.380
I think that's more
than reasonable, Mr. Leo.

37:27.414 --> 37:29.517
I guess what we need
now is a plastic cup.

37:31.283 --> 37:32.085
Plastic cup.

37:32.119 --> 37:33.220
Plastic cup.

37:33.252 --> 37:34.087
Right away.

37:46.931 --> 37:48.365
That went well.

37:51.668 --> 37:53.771
You think you're slick?

37:54.937 --> 37:55.972
Why, because I got a job?

37:56.005 --> 37:57.339
No, because you're playing me

37:57.372 --> 37:59.142
and you're playing the system.

37:59.175 --> 38:00.576
Love, let's get one
thing straight, okay?

38:00.610 --> 38:02.409
I'm not playing shit.

38:02.443 --> 38:03.945
I got convicted
for smuggling drugs

38:03.979 --> 38:05.412
and if you wanna get
technical, it's for weed.

38:05.446 --> 38:08.115
And I believe that
is 100% legal now,

38:08.149 --> 38:10.283
so if anyone is being
played by the system.

38:13.787 --> 38:14.654
Whatever.

38:14.687 --> 38:16.288
Something doesn't feel right.

38:16.321 --> 38:18.457
Have you ever thought
of, I mean, just a concept,

38:18.490 --> 38:22.995
have you ever thought of treating
me as a actual human being

38:23.028 --> 38:25.428
rather than parole number 15
on your to do list for the day?

38:25.462 --> 38:27.765
Because then maybe you would
see that not everything

38:27.799 --> 38:29.200
is as you think it is.

38:30.635 --> 38:31.701
Is that right?

38:34.204 --> 38:35.572
Yeah, that's right.

38:36.906 --> 38:39.208
Because then if you did that,
maybe you could consider

38:39.241 --> 38:43.111
you and parole number 15, I
don't know, seeing a movie,

38:43.144 --> 38:44.311
grabbing some food or something.

38:45.479 --> 38:46.281
You're crazy.

38:46.313 --> 38:47.782
Yeah, tiny bit.

38:47.816 --> 38:49.783
But you know, in a fun way
not in some weird creepy

38:49.817 --> 38:52.119
Norman Bates kind of way.

38:52.152 --> 38:55.054
Right, and he
just loved his mama.

38:55.087 --> 38:56.589
I rest my case.

38:58.257 --> 38:59.792
Buckle up.

38:59.826 --> 39:00.826
Yes ma'am.

39:52.435 --> 39:53.871
Gracias mijita.

40:00.942 --> 40:02.677
Ese, I just found out.

40:02.711 --> 40:04.980
The Brit, he's out and
he's with his crew.

40:06.780 --> 40:08.048
Here, in Califas

40:21.226 --> 40:23.328
So do you want
us to bring him in?

40:58.591 --> 40:59.592
Uno mas por favor.

41:01.693 --> 41:02.827
You have somewhere to be?

41:02.861 --> 41:04.930
Yeah, I'm on
watch, new parolee.

41:04.963 --> 41:07.331
Who are you kidding, you've
been done with all that

41:07.364 --> 41:08.599
by a mile.

41:08.632 --> 41:11.502
Not even close, got
me a score to settle.

41:15.271 --> 41:16.472
I'm going.

41:16.506 --> 41:18.408
Tucker, don't you
even think about it.

41:18.440 --> 41:20.142
This ain't over yet.

41:20.175 --> 41:21.009
Bill?

41:28.049 --> 41:29.951
Sheriff Tucker's
back in the saddle.

41:31.618 --> 41:32.451
You got it.

42:32.102 --> 42:33.570
All right.

42:33.603 --> 42:36.072
Let's see if these access codes
are worth the price we paid.

42:41.010 --> 42:41.844
Yes!

42:43.444 --> 42:44.445
Ladies first.

42:54.587 --> 42:58.124
Come on man, leave that
fucking thing, come on.

43:08.966 --> 43:10.000
Dude, what are we looking for?

43:10.034 --> 43:11.301
I want 3%.

43:12.302 --> 43:13.136
It's a door.

43:14.637 --> 43:16.005
That's a door.

43:16.039 --> 43:17.240
That's the men's room.

43:18.440 --> 43:20.275
Will you stop staring
at all the pictures?

43:20.308 --> 43:24.212
We're looking for a door, not
a photograph of J Edgar Hoover

43:27.482 --> 43:28.382
Oh shit.

43:29.717 --> 43:30.817
Look at that.

43:33.219 --> 43:35.622
The master vault,
and I found it.

43:35.655 --> 43:37.389
It's not in a vault.

43:39.124 --> 43:40.225
It's not?

43:40.259 --> 43:42.461
Look at that, man.

43:43.661 --> 43:46.532
Look at this, files,
these are the files.

43:46.564 --> 43:50.233
I mean, come on, look at that,
this is like serious shit.

43:50.267 --> 43:51.935
This is not what
we are looking for.

43:51.968 --> 43:54.471
Come on, this is what we
wanted, employee records,

43:54.504 --> 43:59.509
Oh, that has to be important,
they saved it on VHS.

43:59.975 --> 44:00.775
It's VHS.

44:00.809 --> 44:02.277
Yeah.

44:02.310 --> 44:03.812
They're not going to store
anything important on VHS.

44:03.845 --> 44:04.679
They're not?

44:05.847 --> 44:08.649
Maybe they'll have
it on a floppy desk.

44:08.682 --> 44:11.553
It's not even a floppy
disk, this is a CD ROM.

44:11.585 --> 44:13.286
You're just being like
this because I found it

44:13.319 --> 44:14.921
and you didn't, it's okay.

44:14.954 --> 44:16.557
Because I told you, we're
not looking for a vault.

44:16.589 --> 44:18.057
What are we looking for?

44:18.091 --> 44:20.225
We're looking for a freaking
room, I told you a room...

44:20.258 --> 44:21.393
This is a room.

44:21.426 --> 44:22.627
This is a vault room,

44:22.661 --> 44:24.563
we're looking for
like a server room.

44:24.595 --> 44:25.729
What is this?

44:25.763 --> 44:27.064
You're an idiot.

44:27.098 --> 44:28.265
And this is a server.

44:29.767 --> 44:30.934
What a fucking asshole.

44:44.278 --> 44:45.447
Go fuck yourself.

44:46.948 --> 44:49.484
You motherfucker, you
can't hit shit, look at you.

44:50.784 --> 44:51.818
Fuck you, can't
shoot for shit,

44:51.852 --> 44:53.954
that's why you can't hit shit.

44:53.987 --> 44:56.490
And that's why I hit
your wife last night.

44:56.523 --> 44:58.190
Oh, you didn't invite me, bro.

44:59.058 --> 44:59.892
Nope.

45:01.126 --> 45:02.327
Let's go.

45:02.360 --> 45:03.596
All right, bud.

45:06.197 --> 45:08.298
This is why I hate
coming to straight bars.

45:08.332 --> 45:11.168
Like look, you got a frat boy
row and a bunch of club skanks

45:11.201 --> 45:12.969
who can't get laid
by the life end.

45:14.403 --> 45:16.205
Relax, let them have fun.

45:17.373 --> 45:18.874
Are you having fun?

45:18.907 --> 45:20.443
Hell yeah, badass.

45:20.476 --> 45:22.978
Okay babe, time to clock in.

45:42.994 --> 45:43.828
Shit.

45:45.730 --> 45:47.633
I told you not to bring
that stupid fucking thing.

45:47.665 --> 45:49.132
This is legit.

45:49.166 --> 45:50.501
Legit, it's a
fucking vacuum cleaner,

45:50.535 --> 45:51.469
and lower your voice.

45:51.502 --> 45:52.903
No it's not, it's a waxer.

45:52.936 --> 45:54.837
God, you're a fucking waxer.

45:54.870 --> 45:57.139
Yeah, I waxed your mom's ass.

45:57.173 --> 45:58.307
We'll talk about that later.

45:58.340 --> 45:59.241
You know, why
don't you carry this,

45:59.275 --> 46:00.576
you're the muscular one.

46:00.609 --> 46:03.178
I'm the brains, I'm
supposed to be looking.

46:03.211 --> 46:04.480
You're the brains, all right.

46:04.513 --> 46:05.680
And you're the brawn.

46:07.881 --> 46:08.749
Oh shit.

46:10.951 --> 46:12.052
What did we do?

46:16.355 --> 46:18.090
Be cool dude,
let me handle this.

47:01.159 --> 47:03.161
What the fuck did you
tell those guys about me?

47:04.062 --> 47:06.030
I said you were a great guy.

47:06.064 --> 47:07.432
You're full of shit.

47:07.465 --> 47:09.199
No, I'm not.

47:09.233 --> 47:11.201
Did you always
have that mustache?

47:11.235 --> 47:14.638
Maybe, or maybe it's
just an awesome cover.

47:14.671 --> 47:16.906
I took theatrical makeup
classes in college.

47:18.007 --> 47:18.807
You're full of shit.

47:18.840 --> 47:19.675
No, I promise you

47:24.079 --> 47:26.146
Which one of those are you on?

47:29.016 --> 47:30.149
I'll take the one in brown.

48:13.520 --> 48:16.088
Okay, what I'm
looking for is like a...

48:16.122 --> 48:17.957
Should be a little
bigger than these

48:22.027 --> 48:23.429
Seriously?

48:23.462 --> 48:24.828
There's fucking Christmas
lights in that box,

48:24.862 --> 48:25.996
this room's bullshit.

48:27.064 --> 48:28.932
What do you expect, man,

48:28.966 --> 48:31.100
it's turned into
a storage closet.

48:31.134 --> 48:32.603
Dude, I can tell by
the back of your head,

48:32.636 --> 48:34.170
you don't know what
the fuck you're doing.

48:34.203 --> 48:35.606
Oh, really?

48:35.639 --> 48:37.272
This has all the information
that we need on it.

48:37.306 --> 48:39.174
This has the last known
whereabouts of the Sinaloa cartel,

48:39.207 --> 48:41.276
this has the last known
whereabouts of the truck,

48:41.310 --> 48:43.612
where the $33
million disappeared.

48:43.645 --> 48:45.313
So I think if you
just give it a minute,

48:45.346 --> 48:48.114
let this talk to this,
we'll be out of here.

48:48.148 --> 48:49.049
Hurry the fuck up, man.

48:49.082 --> 48:50.785
We're here because of you.

48:50.817 --> 48:52.620
Tony listen, I know you
think that this whole thing

48:52.653 --> 48:54.721
is my fault, but let me tell
you something, it's not.

48:54.754 --> 48:56.389
I didn't bang El
Gordo's daughter.

48:56.423 --> 48:58.023
Yeah, well it's not
my fault all right?

48:58.057 --> 48:59.291
Yes, it is.

48:59.325 --> 49:01.794
Think about it, I met
Olivia through Damien,

49:01.826 --> 49:03.562
Damien introduced us.

49:03.595 --> 49:06.363
So this is just a
big play by Damian,

49:06.397 --> 49:08.800
he was taking El Gordo's
mind off of his money

49:08.832 --> 49:10.300
and putting it
onto his daughter.

49:10.334 --> 49:12.902
So he's more concerned with
me and his daughter hooking up

49:12.935 --> 49:14.738
than he is his $33 million.

49:14.771 --> 49:17.206
And when his $33 million
is being transported

49:17.239 --> 49:18.507
across the desert, what happens?

49:18.541 --> 49:20.241
It just magically disappears?

49:20.275 --> 49:22.445
Or maybe that's
what Damien wanted.

49:23.579 --> 49:25.846
We were just pawns
in his game of chess.

49:25.879 --> 49:27.382
You were the diversion.

49:27.415 --> 49:28.650
Right, I was the diversion.

49:28.683 --> 49:31.150
Fucking Damien,
that's pretty slick.

49:31.184 --> 49:32.653
You finally get it.

49:32.686 --> 49:34.822
Man, I'm really proud of
you, welcome to the party.

49:34.854 --> 49:36.656
Hack this fucking
thing, let's go.

49:57.239 --> 49:58.441
Hey, what's up?

49:58.475 --> 50:00.341
How you doing, gorgeous?

50:00.376 --> 50:02.378
Just here having some fun.

50:02.411 --> 50:03.379
Thanks for the drinks.

50:03.412 --> 50:04.245
You're welcome.

50:05.748 --> 50:08.516
How about you, you're
just having some fun too?

50:08.549 --> 50:10.518
Yeah, same.

50:10.551 --> 50:11.351
Cool.

50:11.386 --> 50:12.753
Cool.

50:12.786 --> 50:14.053
Cool.

50:20.726 --> 50:24.194
Hey, hands up
fool, remember me?

50:25.430 --> 50:27.264
Party at your guys
crib, all right?

50:27.297 --> 50:30.066
Ladies, wait, what are
we getting into here?

50:30.099 --> 50:31.367
Oh parties, I love parties.

50:31.402 --> 50:33.804
Oh, there's a
party in my pants.

50:33.837 --> 50:35.406
She likes parties a lot.

50:35.439 --> 50:38.541
I got a party in my pants.

50:38.574 --> 50:39.375
High five

50:39.409 --> 50:40.810
High five!

50:40.843 --> 50:43.144
Pants party,
it's a pants party.

50:43.177 --> 50:44.379
Ew.

50:44.413 --> 50:47.314
It's over here, come
over here with me.

50:47.348 --> 50:48.549
It's so far.

50:48.582 --> 50:50.785
I know, I know,
piggy back ride.

50:51.786 --> 50:52.952
Oh, fuck me.

50:55.954 --> 50:58.090
Oh yeah, this is ridiculous.

50:58.123 --> 51:00.124
You're a grown man.

51:00.158 --> 51:01.460
Oh God, okay.

51:01.493 --> 51:04.061
Okay, get up on this,
come on, get on up.

51:05.263 --> 51:06.930
Come on, before I have
to man handle you.

51:21.943 --> 51:23.412
You good?

51:23.446 --> 51:25.847
I'll get the car, throw
their asses in, yeah?

51:25.880 --> 51:26.714
Yeah.

51:29.016 --> 51:30.283
Oh shit.

51:33.887 --> 51:34.721
Remember me?

51:36.789 --> 51:38.056
- Fuck.
- Fuck.

51:41.794 --> 51:43.795
Papa wants to
speak to the Brit.

52:05.814 --> 52:09.517
Damien, I'm not
interrupting anything, am I?

52:13.887 --> 52:14.721
Hello, Layla.

52:16.055 --> 52:18.691
No, I've just been working,
just doing my thing.

52:18.724 --> 52:21.125
Long day at work, not
used to that you know.

52:21.159 --> 52:22.895
Right, work.

52:24.094 --> 52:24.896
- You okay?
- Uh-huh

52:24.929 --> 52:26.865
Everything good?

52:26.898 --> 52:29.534
I've been a good boy, didn't
get home late than my curfew,

52:29.567 --> 52:31.033
didn't even touch this thing.

52:32.669 --> 52:34.136
Let me see.

52:34.170 --> 52:36.439
I'm doing as I'm supposed
to do, and now a check...

52:41.176 --> 52:45.112
So parolee number 15,
you asked the other day.

52:46.781 --> 52:48.114
Ready to catch that movie?

52:49.583 --> 52:52.218
I mean, I could also put
this back on and go home.

52:52.252 --> 52:53.086
Well,

52:54.721 --> 52:56.321
you're buying.

52:56.356 --> 52:57.657
No shit.

52:57.690 --> 52:58.825
You barely just got a job.

52:58.858 --> 53:00.324
It's true.

53:00.359 --> 53:03.261
Hey, I gotta put
my shoes on again.

53:04.095 --> 53:05.697
Hurry up.

53:05.731 --> 53:07.330
Yes ma'am.

53:17.273 --> 53:19.842
It's good to be out, you know.

53:19.875 --> 53:20.709
It is.

53:25.078 --> 53:26.748
I haven't seen
a movie in like,

53:26.781 --> 53:27.715
Six years?

53:29.617 --> 53:31.117
Yeah, six years.

53:33.921 --> 53:35.054
I mean, we saw movies

53:35.888 --> 53:37.523
but it wasn't in a

53:37.557 --> 53:39.625
it wasn't in a
real movie theater.

53:40.993 --> 53:41.893
I get it.

53:43.562 --> 53:45.697
I used spend every
weekend at the movies,

53:45.730 --> 53:50.601
I mean literally every
weekend, all weekend.

53:50.634 --> 53:52.436
Such a nerd boy.

53:52.469 --> 53:54.102
Any favorites?

53:54.136 --> 53:55.939
Yeah, loads, too
many to mention.

53:57.774 --> 53:58.608
I guess,

54:01.108 --> 54:02.344
I guess I'm a Bond guy.

54:04.312 --> 54:06.212
That explains a lot.

54:06.246 --> 54:07.080
Why's that?

54:08.749 --> 54:12.586
Danger, espionage, women.

54:13.420 --> 54:15.822
That's me, every day.

54:23.861 --> 54:25.095
The turn's the other way.

54:26.163 --> 54:27.765
Taking me somewhere new, Layla?

54:29.132 --> 54:31.267
Why, you're afraid of
taking you somewhere intimate

54:31.300 --> 54:32.636
Mr. Brooks?

54:32.669 --> 54:35.805
Kinda scared, but,
I can handle intimate.

54:48.349 --> 54:51.184
Is this intimate
enough for you?

54:52.151 --> 54:52.987
Yeah.

54:54.621 --> 54:57.255
I could never have done
this before, not, you know,

54:57.289 --> 54:58.858
not with a guy like you.

55:01.125 --> 55:02.628
Oh, you mean an English man.

55:04.663 --> 55:06.063
No, a parolee.

55:08.633 --> 55:11.134
Look, we don't
have to do this,

55:12.636 --> 55:14.303
we can go see a
movie, it's okay.

55:16.506 --> 55:17.340
But I want to.

55:19.808 --> 55:21.577
It's been a minute.

55:56.171 --> 55:57.006
Dammit.

55:58.841 --> 55:59.675
Women.

56:07.548 --> 56:09.083
It was nice though.

56:28.733 --> 56:30.167
Yeah.

56:30.232 --> 56:31.001
William
Tucker, this is Francesca

56:31.034 --> 56:32.201
with Mr. Leo's office.

56:32.234 --> 56:33.670
He'd like to see
you at the casino.

56:33.704 --> 56:35.271
- Who?
- Today.

56:46.715 --> 56:47.549
Leo Cap.

56:48.749 --> 56:51.385
Go, meet me in the office.

56:54.554 --> 56:55.555
Sheriff Tucker,

56:56.556 --> 56:58.791
welcome to Fantasy Springs.

56:58.825 --> 57:00.392
So how'd you get my number?

57:00.425 --> 57:01.560
That doesn't matter,

57:02.894 --> 57:05.262
what matters is, how bad
do you wanna close the door

57:05.296 --> 57:08.132
on that chase you've been
on for the last six years?

57:08.165 --> 57:09.633
What are you talking about?

57:11.068 --> 57:14.003
A friend of ours wanted me
to relay a message to you.

57:15.270 --> 57:16.271
Is that right?

57:16.306 --> 57:17.140
That's right.

57:21.944 --> 57:22.845
And what's that?

57:24.277 --> 57:27.415
I read in a paper a few
years ago that a couple

57:27.448 --> 57:31.651
of your men killed a few
guys in a bust gone bad

57:31.685 --> 57:34.921
over a couple of
pounds of marijuana.

57:34.955 --> 57:36.021
Yeah, that's right.

57:37.790 --> 57:40.092
Well, that same friend
wanted me to tell you

57:41.427 --> 57:44.763
that ends today, 4:00 PM.

57:50.033 --> 57:52.002
What's this, coordinates?

57:52.035 --> 57:54.237
I'd go strapped if
I were you, sheriff.

57:54.269 --> 57:55.104
I always do.

58:07.114 --> 58:09.750
Yeah, it's me.

58:09.784 --> 58:11.252
It's done.

58:21.960 --> 58:23.928
Dude, it smells
like shit in here.

58:23.961 --> 58:26.430
Like it actually smells like
a mix of carrots and shit.

58:26.464 --> 58:28.266
We're gonna
fucking die here.

58:28.299 --> 58:29.666
Fucking morons.

58:29.699 --> 58:31.468
Shut the fuck up white boy.

58:32.836 --> 58:33.970
That wasn't Cici.

58:34.004 --> 58:35.438
I said, shut the fuck up.

58:35.472 --> 58:36.305
The bags.

58:39.341 --> 58:40.176
Hey.

58:41.576 --> 58:43.178
Hey, white boy.

58:43.211 --> 58:44.813
What are you
doing here, Olivia?

58:46.648 --> 58:48.215
You never called me back.

58:51.318 --> 58:52.386
Stop, Kuko?

58:53.486 --> 58:54.887
Come on!

58:54.921 --> 58:57.190
Don't do this Kuko, you
don't have to do this.

59:02.527 --> 59:04.796
See, I told you she wanted me.

59:04.830 --> 59:06.330
It's true, I did.

59:08.165 --> 59:09.834
That was then, and this,

59:11.668 --> 59:12.836
this is now.

59:15.371 --> 59:17.308
And Papa wants to
speak to your boss.

59:17.373 --> 59:18.707
Lady, we don't
know where he is.

59:22.010 --> 59:22.845
We do.

59:40.860 --> 59:42.260
Together again.

59:46.397 --> 59:47.965
Yeah, as always.

59:49.733 --> 59:50.868
You look good.

59:50.901 --> 59:51.735
Thank you.

59:53.536 --> 59:57.506
Look, we're not animals here,
we're just here to talk.

59:57.540 --> 01:00:01.810
And I can think of about 33
million things to talk about,

01:00:02.711 --> 01:00:04.179
you know?

01:00:04.212 --> 01:00:06.847
Look, Olivia, I don't have
the money, I never have.

01:00:06.881 --> 01:00:09.550
You can ask the DEA, fuck faces.

01:00:10.951 --> 01:00:12.685
Wasn't my gentlemen, it
certainly wasn't my fuck up.

01:00:12.719 --> 01:00:13.953
Oh no?

01:00:13.987 --> 01:00:15.521
Absolutely not.

01:00:15.555 --> 01:00:17.358
So maybe it was
their fuck up, right?

01:00:17.389 --> 01:00:19.458
But they don't know
where the money went.

01:00:20.959 --> 01:00:22.961
They said the Sinaloa bus was
delivered to a drop off point

01:00:22.995 --> 01:00:24.595
in the middle of the Salton sea

01:00:24.629 --> 01:00:26.063
and no one ever saw it again.

01:00:27.231 --> 01:00:29.399
Everyone knows that
story, give me a break,

01:00:29.432 --> 01:00:30.967
it's on the bloody internet.

01:00:31.001 --> 01:00:33.103
- So it's legend now, right?
- That's right.

01:00:33.136 --> 01:00:34.738
Millions buried
out in the desert.

01:00:34.771 --> 01:00:37.172
Many people have tried to
find it, you know that?

01:00:38.407 --> 01:00:40.409
Daddy even took sonar out there,

01:00:40.442 --> 01:00:41.542
you know, excavation site guns.

01:00:41.576 --> 01:00:42.777
You know what they found?

01:00:44.112 --> 01:00:44.946
No.

01:00:46.748 --> 01:00:48.515
Don't fucking
get cute right now.

01:00:50.083 --> 01:00:50.918
You don't know,

01:00:52.686 --> 01:00:54.954
no, they found bags of dirt

01:00:54.987 --> 01:00:57.723
with X's sprayed on
them, buried deep.

01:00:57.757 --> 01:01:02.761
So now, you tell
me what they are,

01:01:03.595 --> 01:01:04.496
what you've been planning

01:01:04.529 --> 01:01:06.730
and where the fuck is our money.

01:01:06.764 --> 01:01:07.932
Olivia I...

01:01:14.137 --> 01:01:15.605
The parole
officer is a nurse?

01:01:15.638 --> 01:01:17.106
No dude,
it's his daughter.

01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:19.675
Papa has been wanting to
talk to you for some time.

01:01:25.947 --> 01:01:27.782
No misunderstanding,
Mr. Brooks,

01:01:30.284 --> 01:01:32.852
only tell us where it is,

01:01:34.487 --> 01:01:36.121
or your people are next.

01:01:37.489 --> 01:01:38.958
My people are next for what?

01:01:40.125 --> 01:01:42.160
Last chance Mr. Brooks.

01:01:43.395 --> 01:01:44.595
Please.

01:01:44.629 --> 01:01:47.266
Papa doesn't give
second chances, Damien.

01:01:47.298 --> 01:01:49.866
Calm, correct and recall.

01:01:50.968 --> 01:01:53.036
Kill them all.

01:01:55.972 --> 01:01:56.906
Okay, okay, okay.

01:02:05.013 --> 01:02:06.847
I'll tell you where the money is

01:02:08.082 --> 01:02:10.352
but we've all got
to go, all of us,

01:02:10.385 --> 01:02:11.851
including these fuck faces.

01:02:37.006 --> 01:02:39.675
Maybe trusting me one
more time wouldn't hurt.

01:02:50.418 --> 01:02:51.252
I'm sorry.

01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:59.125
My daughters will take you,
that wasn't so hard, was it?

01:02:59.758 --> 01:03:00.658
No.

01:03:00.692 --> 01:03:03.995
Pride, is no good amigo.

01:03:04.029 --> 01:03:07.097
When you think you're
too smart, it's not good.

01:03:09.133 --> 01:03:12.369
This is not about who
is smart and who is not.

01:03:14.637 --> 01:03:16.706
This is about money.

01:03:24.812 --> 01:03:28.916
And this piece of shit
messing with my daughter.

01:03:28.949 --> 01:03:32.685
No, you disrespectful
piece of shit!

01:03:32.719 --> 01:03:34.422
Papa.

01:03:34.455 --> 01:03:36.188
You happy?

01:03:41.592 --> 01:03:43.561
We make $30 million a month,

01:03:45.330 --> 01:03:47.031
you think I care
about that money?

01:03:47.065 --> 01:03:48.165
No sir.

01:03:49.166 --> 01:03:50.667
Fuck that money.

01:03:52.135 --> 01:03:55.071
But respect has a fucking price,

01:03:56.572 --> 01:03:59.974
and that price is $33
million or your heads

01:04:00.008 --> 01:04:01.743
on a fucking spike!

01:04:08.483 --> 01:04:12.752
So now, let's
take a ride, yeah?

01:04:13.619 --> 01:04:15.788
Sounds like a good idea.

01:05:36.822 --> 01:05:39.825
- Let's go Loco.
- I'll make it easy.

01:05:52.336 --> 01:05:53.836
- Let's go.
- Fuck.

01:05:53.869 --> 01:05:56.138
If this is all for nothing
and we're on some bullshit,

01:05:56.172 --> 01:05:57.873
fake chase, de mata.

01:05:57.907 --> 01:05:59.073
Calm down, Layla.

01:06:00.376 --> 01:06:01.343
Fuck you, man.

01:06:13.587 --> 01:06:15.888
So did your guys
bring what we need?

01:06:15.922 --> 01:06:16.889
Of course we did.

01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:23.428
I don't think you're
dressed for this ladies,

01:06:23.461 --> 01:06:25.363
you wanna cut me free?

01:06:28.032 --> 01:06:29.999
- Kuko.
- Fuck that.

01:06:30.033 --> 01:06:31.535
Just do it Kuko.

01:06:34.204 --> 01:06:35.305
You tricky white boy.

01:06:42.444 --> 01:06:43.711
Well, I think it's gonna
probably take me all day

01:06:43.744 --> 01:06:46.381
unless you cut my crew free.

01:06:47.714 --> 01:06:48.549
Do it.

01:06:49.483 --> 01:06:50.717
Hurry the fuck up Kuko.

01:07:01.092 --> 01:07:03.362
Fucking asshole.

01:07:03.395 --> 01:07:05.396
Okay well, give them
the disk, log them in

01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:07.699
and answer the bypass code.

01:07:07.731 --> 01:07:08.566
What?

01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:10.702
Fuck that, no way, man.

01:07:10.734 --> 01:07:12.436
Uh uh, I ain't
giving up my money.

01:07:13.769 --> 01:07:14.870
You're not?

01:07:14.904 --> 01:07:16.038
Jeff, just fucking do it.

01:07:16.072 --> 01:07:16.872
No.

01:07:16.906 --> 01:07:18.039
Jeff, what the hell?

01:07:18.073 --> 01:07:19.408
Do you wanna die?

01:07:19.442 --> 01:07:21.076
Listen to your girl white boy.

01:07:22.010 --> 01:07:22.844
Fuck!

01:07:36.489 --> 01:07:37.523
What's on the disk?

01:07:38.790 --> 01:07:40.426
The actual GPS location.

01:07:42.294 --> 01:07:43.961
Don't be putting
something that aint right,

01:07:43.995 --> 01:07:45.830
my men will kill
you where you stand.

01:07:46.963 --> 01:07:49.433
There, it's logged
in, you can do the rest.

01:07:49.467 --> 01:07:51.167
I'm fucking done.

01:07:53.637 --> 01:07:56.071
Okay, show
us where it is, Brit.

01:07:56.105 --> 01:07:57.607
Come on, we don't got all day!

01:08:03.279 --> 01:08:04.846
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:08:04.879 --> 01:08:06.813
Officer down, 10:00,

01:08:06.847 --> 01:08:09.651
This is sheriff Bill
Tucker, shots fired.

01:08:09.684 --> 01:08:11.451
Track this call, send support.

01:08:18.189 --> 01:08:19.924
What have you done?

01:08:19.957 --> 01:08:22.295
They were essential to the
location you dumb fuck!

01:08:22.328 --> 01:08:24.429
Who are you calling
dumb fuck, ese,

01:08:24.462 --> 01:08:25.363
I'll blast your ass too.

01:08:25.397 --> 01:08:26.830
No, you won't Kuko, stop.

01:08:26.863 --> 01:08:28.399
Calm your man down.

01:08:33.970 --> 01:08:35.037
Yeah, you're right.

01:08:36.037 --> 01:08:39.073
You know, because this fucker

01:08:40.243 --> 01:08:42.143
executes two men
for taking a step,

01:08:42.176 --> 01:08:44.613
you trigger happy mother fucker!

01:08:44.645 --> 01:08:47.782
Olivia, say the fucking
word, fuck this money.

01:08:47.814 --> 01:08:48.783
What do you mean
fuck the money?

01:08:48.814 --> 01:08:49.983
Daddy's going to be pissed.

01:08:50.015 --> 01:08:51.151
Who cares?

01:08:51.184 --> 01:08:52.787
- I fucking care.
- What am I doing guys?

01:08:52.819 --> 01:08:55.287
You're fucking answering
the code white boy.

01:08:55.322 --> 01:08:56.154
Fucking do it.

01:08:57.490 --> 01:08:58.792
Wait.

01:08:58.823 --> 01:08:59.957
No, don't wait.

01:08:59.991 --> 01:09:01.193
Don't fucking wait.

01:09:01.225 --> 01:09:03.362
Don't touch that
fucking thing, Jeff.

01:09:10.667 --> 01:09:11.702
Fuck!

01:09:11.734 --> 01:09:13.169
Cover!

01:09:13.203 --> 01:09:15.805
Stay safe.

01:09:29.616 --> 01:09:30.983
Cici, start the car now!

01:09:31.017 --> 01:09:31.884
Let's go!

01:09:33.086 --> 01:09:37.657
What the fuck's happening!

01:09:47.698 --> 01:09:50.201
Mate, piss off, I've got this.

01:09:52.536 --> 01:09:54.103
Come on!

01:10:29.065 --> 01:10:30.967
Jeep is carrying the
daughters of Sinaloa cartel boss

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.903
Joje Gordinez,
suspects in second SUV

01:10:33.936 --> 01:10:36.339
belong to Damien
Brooks, copy that?

01:10:44.111 --> 01:10:45.079
That's far enough.

01:10:51.084 --> 01:10:52.752
Looks like you got
me again, sheriff.

01:10:54.086 --> 01:10:54.920
Did I?

01:10:56.322 --> 01:10:58.725
I don't know what to tell you.

01:10:58.757 --> 01:11:01.427
You're going to
jail all over again,

01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:03.495
all these men are
dead because of you.

01:11:03.529 --> 01:11:07.097
Yeah, DEA, crooked as fuck.

01:11:09.167 --> 01:11:11.568
Couple of murdering
shit bags back there.

01:11:11.601 --> 01:11:12.669
You don't know that.

01:11:13.537 --> 01:11:14.371
Don't I?

01:11:17.273 --> 01:11:21.544
Sheriff go home, spend some
quality time with your daughter.

01:11:23.278 --> 01:11:24.179
What'd you say?

01:11:24.212 --> 01:11:26.681
I said go home, enjoy life.

01:11:26.714 --> 01:11:28.882
I mean, isn't that what
the fuck it's about?

01:11:31.385 --> 01:11:33.085
Fucking enjoying life.

01:11:33.119 --> 01:11:34.188
There is no money.

01:11:35.188 --> 01:11:36.756
This was all for
nothing, Brooks,

01:11:36.789 --> 01:11:38.391
just tell me it
was all bullshit.

01:11:41.793 --> 01:11:42.627
I'm leaving now,

01:11:44.563 --> 01:11:45.397
this is goodbye.

01:11:46.897 --> 01:11:48.299
You're not going anywhere.

01:11:49.700 --> 01:11:54.304
I am, this can be the
end here, Mr. Tucker.

01:11:55.305 --> 01:11:56.439
For both of us.

01:11:56.473 --> 01:11:58.341
I'll kill you
were you stand, son.

01:11:58.374 --> 01:12:01.810
I ain't got nothing
else, this is it.

01:12:01.844 --> 01:12:04.011
You lost your life,
I took that from you,

01:12:05.179 --> 01:12:06.380
that's on me.

01:12:11.551 --> 01:12:14.987
Let me make it right, give
it all back and some more.

01:12:17.389 --> 01:12:18.224
Think about it.

01:12:19.358 --> 01:12:20.960
You just took down
the second in command

01:12:20.992 --> 01:12:24.229
of the Sinaloa cartel,
you got a squad back there

01:12:24.262 --> 01:12:27.130
on the FBI's most wanted
list, and there's a laptop

01:12:27.165 --> 01:12:29.633
that belongs to El Gordo's
daughter with the IP addresses

01:12:29.666 --> 01:12:31.869
of their now on
unencrypted communications.

01:12:33.504 --> 01:12:35.505
That's a huge fuck
up for the syndicate.

01:12:37.773 --> 01:12:39.609
They'll reward you
for this, sheriff.

01:12:41.843 --> 01:12:43.945
And for us, I think
there's some wonder in it.

01:12:47.248 --> 01:12:49.517
Let's close the door on
this right, shall we?

01:12:52.219 --> 01:12:53.386
You won't see me again.

01:12:55.421 --> 01:12:59.056
I don't know, and the money?

01:13:00.526 --> 01:13:02.995
They say it's buried
out there somewhere.

01:13:03.027 --> 01:13:03.829
Right.

01:13:03.862 --> 01:13:04.695
Who knows?

01:13:06.464 --> 01:13:07.598
See you around, sir.

01:14:01.577 --> 01:14:04.546
El Día de los Muertos,
beautiful, right?

01:14:04.579 --> 01:14:05.413
Yes it is.

01:14:07.848 --> 01:14:09.383
Thank you for coming today.

01:14:09.417 --> 01:14:11.451
I know it's not your thing.

01:14:11.484 --> 01:14:13.954
No, I wouldn't miss it,
it was a nice ceremony.

01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:16.722
Well, you proud
of your little girl?

01:14:16.755 --> 01:14:17.590
Mh-mhh.

01:14:19.258 --> 01:14:20.426
I got something for you.

01:14:21.594 --> 01:14:22.494
Dad.

01:14:22.528 --> 01:14:24.295
Go on sweet heart, open it.

01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:32.502
Hey, I'm done, it's over.

01:14:33.971 --> 01:14:36.305
I just want to be your
dad now, if that's okay.

01:14:39.508 --> 01:14:40.642
Thank you.

01:14:40.675 --> 01:14:42.177
Come here.

01:14:42.210 --> 01:14:43.612
I love you Jamie.

01:15:00.459 --> 01:15:01.259
Hello?

01:15:01.293 --> 01:15:02.861
Layla.

01:15:02.894 --> 01:15:06.797
Damien, you're fucking crazy.

01:15:06.831 --> 01:15:08.766
I think so.

01:15:08.799 --> 01:15:10.267
You know we're going to
find you and your crew.

01:15:10.301 --> 01:15:12.936
Papa will hunt you down.

01:15:12.969 --> 01:15:16.639
Well, it's a big wide
world, I'll take my chances.

01:15:18.073 --> 01:15:20.042
What, you're making that
last dramatic phone call

01:15:20.075 --> 01:15:22.144
to the girl who got
the drop on the Brit?

01:15:23.578 --> 01:15:26.681
You won't have an old cop
to save your ass next time.

01:15:26.714 --> 01:15:28.449
No, it's not that phone call.

01:15:28.482 --> 01:15:30.684
Just a polite one letting
you know it's over.

01:15:31.852 --> 01:15:34.987
But I'm not, who do
you think runs shit now?

01:15:36.889 --> 01:15:38.290
Well, good for you.

01:15:38.324 --> 01:15:39.892
Game fucking on.

01:15:39.925 --> 01:15:42.794
See I, I think
I'm done with games,

01:15:42.827 --> 01:15:45.230
but I do want you to ask
yourself one question.

01:15:47.164 --> 01:15:48.165
Where's your sister?

01:16:03.845 --> 01:16:05.179
You okay?

01:16:05.212 --> 01:16:06.047
Yeah.

01:16:07.048 --> 01:16:08.416
These fucking girls man.

01:16:34.237 --> 01:16:36.038
You beautiful son of a bitch.

01:16:36.939 --> 01:16:38.507
- Champaign.
- Nice.

01:16:38.541 --> 01:16:39.442
Great to see you.

01:16:40.775 --> 01:16:43.411
Ladies, you look
gorgeous, champagne on me.

01:16:43.445 --> 01:16:44.245
Thank you lovely.

01:16:44.279 --> 01:16:45.080
This guy.

01:16:45.114 --> 01:16:46.081
Come here brother.

01:16:46.115 --> 01:16:47.715
Great to see you.

01:16:47.748 --> 01:16:48.782
Shall we toast?

01:16:48.816 --> 01:16:50.151
Not without me.

01:16:52.286 --> 01:16:53.120
There he is.

01:16:56.156 --> 01:16:57.356
Ola.

01:16:57.390 --> 01:16:59.357
Hey, and here
she is, a wild card.

01:16:59.391 --> 01:17:01.194
Guess daddy's going
to be mad at me.

01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:02.894
Salute.

01:17:11.468 --> 01:17:14.404
So Mr. Brooks,
how did you do it?

01:17:18.108 --> 01:17:19.241
You wanna tell?

01:17:19.274 --> 01:17:21.144
No, you tell her.

01:17:21.177 --> 01:17:23.878
Come on, you do it, I'm tired.

01:17:25.313 --> 01:17:27.248
All right look, me and
Damien had been running drugs

01:17:27.281 --> 01:17:29.049
for your dad for years.

01:17:29.082 --> 01:17:32.619
And once we found out
about the DEA bust,

01:17:32.652 --> 01:17:35.755
Damien decided it was time to
make a little retirement plan.

01:17:35.788 --> 01:17:38.225
Our good friend, Mr. Leo Cap,
he happens to be best friends

01:17:38.257 --> 01:17:39.892
with the head of
the truckers union.

01:17:39.925 --> 01:17:41.559
Big Paul, it's
great to see you.

01:17:41.593 --> 01:17:44.729
This is for you, tell
your boys next shipment

01:17:44.763 --> 01:17:46.232
is on Thursday.

01:17:46.264 --> 01:17:47.264
We'll be ready, we'll have
the boys circle the wagon.

01:17:47.297 --> 01:17:48.565
Thanks buddy.

01:17:48.599 --> 01:17:50.801
The car wash, that was
just the perfect cover.

01:17:50.834 --> 01:17:53.269
We took the trucks that
were heading in the carwash,

01:17:53.302 --> 01:17:54.771
diverted them into the
middle of the desert,

01:17:54.804 --> 01:17:57.573
we swapped the cash for dirt,
but somebody was gonna have

01:17:57.607 --> 01:17:58.640
to take the fall.

01:17:59.941 --> 01:18:02.644
Well, you know,
this guy in prison.

01:18:02.677 --> 01:18:04.247
No way.

01:18:04.279 --> 01:18:05.780
I'd have been fine in prison.

01:18:08.816 --> 01:18:09.950
So I did the stretch,

01:18:11.118 --> 01:18:12.852
bought Jeff here some
time to make plans

01:18:12.886 --> 01:18:15.288
for the second
half of this thing.

01:18:15.321 --> 01:18:16.955
And we knew your father
would be on to us,

01:18:16.989 --> 01:18:18.357
because we took his money

01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:20.859
and my buddy here
took his little girl.

01:18:25.496 --> 01:18:28.431
Look I knew your
father would be out for blood

01:18:28.465 --> 01:18:30.467
as soon as I made parole.

01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:32.536
And the data disk drive thing,

01:18:32.569 --> 01:18:34.770
they're just virus
trackers for the cartels.

01:18:34.804 --> 01:18:36.438
And those two DEA guys.

01:18:36.472 --> 01:18:37.506
Bad dudes.

01:18:37.540 --> 01:18:39.675
Well, they're dead now.

01:18:39.708 --> 01:18:42.211
They got done for human
trafficking, but fuck them.

01:18:47.815 --> 01:18:50.717
We knew there were murderers
on the payroll for the cartel

01:18:50.751 --> 01:18:54.288
and they did know the last
known location of the shipment.

01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:56.123
Yeah, but what they didn't
know is how big of a raging

01:18:56.156 --> 01:18:58.623
hard on the sheriff would
have to bust your ass.

01:18:58.657 --> 01:19:00.058
He did.

01:19:00.092 --> 01:19:02.794
And then your sister becoming
his parole officer, I mean,

01:19:02.828 --> 01:19:03.962
that was up with that.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.968
So once we figured it all
out, we used the sheriff

01:19:12.001 --> 01:19:14.370
and Layla as pawns to bring
them all out into the open.

01:19:14.404 --> 01:19:16.839
Then the Sheriff swoops
in, saves the day,

01:19:16.872 --> 01:19:19.608
sets things right,
everybody wins.

01:19:21.877 --> 01:19:23.744
And as for you and me, mi amor,

01:19:24.912 --> 01:19:26.547
you wanted out, your
sister's the boss now,

01:19:26.581 --> 01:19:28.915
she's probably going
to fucking kill us.

01:19:28.949 --> 01:19:31.351
And I think, being millionaires,
we'll have no problem

01:19:31.384 --> 01:19:32.652
hiding from her.

01:19:32.686 --> 01:19:34.720
Okay, okay, but
where's the cash?

01:19:37.257 --> 01:19:38.557
Leo?

01:19:38.591 --> 01:19:39.825
All right.

01:19:39.859 --> 01:19:42.827
I've been cleaning that
money for five years.

01:19:42.861 --> 01:19:46.530
The shipment's been on Rezland
since the very beginning,

01:19:46.563 --> 01:19:50.734
and no pain in the ass,
DEA, FBI or cowboy cops

01:19:50.767 --> 01:19:53.170
were able to get
anywhere near it.

01:19:53.203 --> 01:19:55.004
There's nothing like
an urban legend,

01:19:55.037 --> 01:19:59.507
keep people wanting and looking,
buried treasure, MacGuffin,

01:19:59.541 --> 01:20:01.077
all that Hollywood bullshit.

01:20:01.110 --> 01:20:02.444
And what's it worth now, Leo?

01:20:02.477 --> 01:20:07.448
With interest, $51.2 million.

01:20:09.550 --> 01:20:10.850
I like that.

01:20:10.884 --> 01:20:13.019
- Cheers thots.
- I'll drink to that.

01:20:18.824 --> 01:20:19.925
Where are we going?

01:20:21.727 --> 01:20:23.461
Uh, anywhere the fuck we want?

01:20:24.395 --> 01:20:27.031
Yeah, you choose.

01:20:27.064 --> 01:20:29.367
I'm gonna take a nap.

01:20:29.399 --> 01:20:31.269
Just make sure there's
sunshine, okay?

01:20:48.116 --> 01:20:52.019
Papa, Olivia.

01:20:57.523 --> 01:20:58.357
Olivia?
