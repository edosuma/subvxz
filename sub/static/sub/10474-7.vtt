00:37.680 --> 00:42.070
In Poplar in 1960, the
midwives of Nonnatus House

00:42.120 --> 00:44.310
were on perpetual duty.

00:44.360 --> 00:49.350
New life arrived with every
season, at every time of day.

00:49.400 --> 00:52.270
And in the mists and darkness
of the autumn...

00:52.320 --> 00:53.910
Nearly there, my love.

00:53.960 --> 00:57.510
.. birth sparked a little
light into the gloom,

00:57.560 --> 01:01.430
bringing mystery and hope, the
unknown and the longed for...

01:01.480 --> 01:04.220
burning like a candle in the night.

01:07.480 --> 01:09.630
We've got her from here, Mr Dent.

01:09.680 --> 01:11.220
All right?

01:12.880 --> 01:14.420
That's it.

01:25.120 --> 01:27.670
Thank goodness the water in
Bow is only off for tonight.

01:27.720 --> 01:29.350
We're bursting at the seams.

01:29.400 --> 01:32.500
~ Ah, Mrs Dent.
~ Yes.
~ Let's get you settled.

01:36.040 --> 01:39.270
We've the delivery room ready and
I've commandeered Dr Turner's office

01:39.320 --> 01:41.990
as a second delivery area,
though I'm just wondering

01:42.040 --> 01:44.110
if I should call in
another pair of hands?

01:44.160 --> 01:46.630
Delivering baby when the
Luftwaffe's raining down all

01:46.680 --> 01:48.910
kind of carnage, that's a challenge.

01:48.960 --> 01:51.390
But a lack of running
water and a packed ward?

01:51.440 --> 01:54.540
We'll take that in our
stride, Mrs Turner.

01:56.800 --> 01:59.030
No, it can't be.

01:59.080 --> 02:01.150
"Goldilocks?"

02:01.200 --> 02:02.550
I'm sorry?

02:02.600 --> 02:05.190
Marion Gold? It's me, Shirley Copper.

02:05.240 --> 02:06.550
Well, Dent now.

02:06.600 --> 02:07.710
That's about right,

02:07.760 --> 02:11.630
I can't walk two paces without
bumping into something.

02:11.680 --> 02:13.990
Bow Girls, '48?

02:14.040 --> 02:16.470
I was going out with Ian Dent
and you was stepping out

02:16.520 --> 02:18.230
with that posh one from the Grammar.

02:18.280 --> 02:20.470
Oh, he fancied himself
something rotten.

02:20.520 --> 02:22.550
What was his name? Geoffrey...

02:22.600 --> 02:25.110
Godfrey. My husband.

02:25.160 --> 02:27.360
You ain't changed a bit.

02:28.080 --> 02:31.270
I sent a Christmas card
every year to your mum's.

02:31.320 --> 02:33.310
Well, if this ain't the
cherry on the cake!

02:33.360 --> 02:36.360
This'll make the time
fly by, won't it?

02:36.880 --> 02:40.280
Let's get you into bed, Mrs Dent,
see how far along you are.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.590
And you've done all of this
with your pinhole camera?

02:49.640 --> 02:52.750
Imagine what I could do
with a real camera, Dad.

02:52.800 --> 02:56.670
Getting into the Photographic Club
almost guarantees you a merit badge.

02:56.720 --> 02:59.430
As does making sure this bathroom
is back in working order

02:59.480 --> 03:02.020
by the time Mum comes off duty.

03:04.240 --> 03:06.840
You didn't have to walk me home.

03:07.080 --> 03:11.390
Well, I take the safety of
my volunteers very seriously.

03:11.440 --> 03:13.950
Anything could happen,
this time of night.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.430
You didn't seem too bothered
about Arthur Tuft.

03:16.480 --> 03:18.110
He lives in Limehouse.

03:18.160 --> 03:21.520
Well, maybe I didn't
like his conversation.

03:23.160 --> 03:26.440
Never knew a man could make a
week in Sorrento last so long.

03:32.360 --> 03:34.310
You should keep that locked.

03:34.360 --> 03:37.230
Don't be daft, I know
everyone round here.

03:37.280 --> 03:39.960
Besides, I've got protection.

03:42.920 --> 03:44.630
Good night, Fred.

03:44.680 --> 03:46.600
Night, Vi.

03:58.640 --> 04:02.350
Come on, keep it coming,
yes, not long now, not long.

04:02.400 --> 04:05.350
That's it, go on, go on!
Oh, nearly there, now!

04:05.400 --> 04:08.510
Listen to me, in a minute
I'm going to ask you

04:08.560 --> 04:11.270
to do some little breaths
- just gentle ones.

04:11.320 --> 04:13.230
Like playing the flute?

04:13.280 --> 04:15.550
Yeah, if you like, like
the flute, that's it.

04:15.600 --> 04:18.269
But when I ask for it, all right?

04:21.000 --> 04:24.320
Yes, here we come!
Push, push, push, yes!

04:27.520 --> 04:30.590
Little breaths, please,
little breaths.

04:30.640 --> 04:33.270
That's it. Keep it
light, keep it easy.

04:33.320 --> 04:36.070
Good, very good.

04:36.120 --> 04:39.750
MARION GROANS

04:39.800 --> 04:43.600
~ Ooo, you've got a little girl.
~ BABY CRIES

04:47.480 --> 04:50.080
You have a beautiful daughter...

04:52.480 --> 04:55.220
.. and every inch of her is yours.

04:56.120 --> 04:57.660
I love you.

05:03.800 --> 05:05.510
Has Goldilocks had hers yet?

05:05.560 --> 05:09.790
I need all your concentration.
Nothing else matters.

05:09.840 --> 05:11.510
Another push?

05:13.000 --> 05:15.230
~ Come on, Shirley.
~ I can't do it any more.

05:15.280 --> 05:16.830
We know you're exhausted,

05:16.880 --> 05:19.710
but we want Baby out and
you're doing so brilliantly.

05:19.760 --> 05:21.230
Contraction coming.

05:21.280 --> 05:24.670
Come on now, Shirley,
all the energy you have.

05:24.720 --> 05:27.110
One more push for Baby.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.720
That's it.

05:29.840 --> 05:33.110
You're so close now, Shirley.

05:33.160 --> 05:37.230
Push now, I know it stings.
Keep pushing, it will help.

05:37.280 --> 05:39.880
That's it. That's it. That's it!

05:45.480 --> 05:48.020
You've got a daughter, Shirley.

06:04.080 --> 06:07.150
Now, do remember to push
my borough laundry service.

06:07.200 --> 06:10.390
It's available to all
incontinence patients.

06:10.440 --> 06:14.310
Bed linen washed and returned,
quite free of charge.

06:14.360 --> 06:16.990
That's a list of all our sufferers.

06:17.040 --> 06:19.430
Of course, Nurse Crane.
I'll do my best.

06:19.480 --> 06:22.470
Your best is a tick against
every name on that list.

06:22.520 --> 06:24.070
PHONE RINGS

06:24.120 --> 06:27.280
I'd lead the charge with you, but
I'm telephone bound this morning.

06:30.960 --> 06:32.670
Dad!

06:32.720 --> 06:35.310
I was up half the night
looking for that.

06:35.360 --> 06:37.470
I used to take it everywhere.

06:37.520 --> 06:39.910
A real camera for you, Tim.

06:39.960 --> 06:41.990
Thank you.

06:42.040 --> 06:44.270
It's even got a timer.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.910
For the great self portrait.

06:46.960 --> 06:49.500
"Photographer as a young tyke."

06:50.920 --> 06:52.550
There's a girl.

06:52.600 --> 06:54.310
BABY VOICE: Yes!

06:54.360 --> 06:56.990
Yes, that's right.

06:57.040 --> 07:00.510
Oh! Fingers all strong
like monkey paws.

07:00.560 --> 07:02.600
Ooh, yes.

07:04.320 --> 07:05.950
LOUD EXPLOSION

07:06.000 --> 07:08.110
Good grief! What on earth?!

07:08.160 --> 07:10.870
Fire in the laundry room!
We need to evacuate.

07:10.920 --> 07:12.910
We need to go now. Take the babies.

07:12.960 --> 07:16.060
~ That's it!
~ I'll get the others. BELL RINGS

07:17.720 --> 07:20.830
That's all right. Nothing to
worry your cotton socks about.

07:20.880 --> 07:25.910
We have a fire and we need
to leave quickly and calmly.

07:25.960 --> 07:31.150
Anyone who doesn't feel able
to walk, say so immediately.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.270
Take my arm, Shirley.

07:34.200 --> 07:36.350
~ Can you manage, Mrs Smith?
~ Yes, yes, yes.

07:36.400 --> 07:38.830
They've dropped it, haven't
they? The bomb.

07:38.880 --> 07:40.110
ALL: What?!

07:40.160 --> 07:41.630
Oh, where's my baby, Sister?

07:41.680 --> 07:44.790
Sister Evangelina has your
babies, don't worry.

07:44.840 --> 07:47.270
Your babies are safe. Hurry now.

07:47.320 --> 07:49.120
Fast as you can.

07:53.760 --> 07:55.870
Is anyone hurt? Where's Shelagh?

07:55.920 --> 07:59.430
COUGHING: She's getting them out.
We got everyone. She's coming.

07:59.480 --> 08:02.790
This way, ladies. Quickly,
there you are.

08:02.840 --> 08:04.320
Careful!

08:06.960 --> 08:08.470
Are you all right?

08:08.520 --> 08:10.630
Yes.

08:10.680 --> 08:12.270
There we are.

08:12.320 --> 08:15.960
Everyone to Nonnatus. We'll check
you and your babies there.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.800
This way ladies.

08:29.160 --> 08:30.870
Do let me help you, Mrs Mills.

08:30.920 --> 08:35.080
Oh, no, Sister, it's good for me and
Tommy would hate for anyone to see.

08:38.960 --> 08:42.559
Ah, I've put your egg white
on the side, Sister.

08:50.960 --> 08:53.310
~ Hello, Sister.
~ Hello, Mr Mills.

08:53.360 --> 08:55.590
Let's see to that dressing for you.

08:55.640 --> 08:57.200
Uh-oh!

09:00.760 --> 09:03.560
I'm going to roll you now, Mr Mills.

09:06.080 --> 09:07.880
Ah!

09:11.440 --> 09:13.630
I'm sorry, I know it's
uncomfortable for you.

09:13.680 --> 09:15.420
No, not at all.

09:21.320 --> 09:23.860
It's looking very much better.

09:26.440 --> 09:29.440
I'm going to seal it
with the egg white.

09:31.160 --> 09:32.630
Sister...

09:32.680 --> 09:35.310
There's a new lady and she says

09:35.360 --> 09:38.460
I can't do the washing
for Tommy no more.

09:45.160 --> 09:47.350
(Is she from the Government?)

09:47.400 --> 09:51.750
This is Nurse Gilbert.
She's with us at Nonnatus.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.510
I was just explaining to Mrs Mills

09:53.560 --> 09:56.070
about the council's
new laundry service.

09:56.120 --> 09:59.950
Nurse Crane is very keen that anyone
entitled should make good use of it.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.550
May I put your husband
down for it, Mrs Mills?

10:02.600 --> 10:04.110
It's free of charge

10:04.160 --> 10:07.510
and you can't possibly manage
like this at your age.

10:07.560 --> 10:10.150
Will you tell the lady
she's very kind,

10:10.200 --> 10:12.190
but we wouldn't need a service?

10:12.240 --> 10:13.950
But the damp!

10:14.000 --> 10:16.550
It's a terrible risk to your husband.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.950
I see he had pneumonia
this time last year.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.270
Thank you, Nurse Gilbert.

10:23.400 --> 10:25.830
So sorry to have disturbed
you, Mrs Mills.

10:25.880 --> 10:28.080
I'll come back tomorrow.

10:31.360 --> 10:32.870
I don't understand.

10:32.920 --> 10:35.950
Surely she would benefit from
the service more than anyone.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.710
She's so frail.

10:37.760 --> 10:40.790
But Mr Mills would be terribly upset
if he thought he was on a list

10:40.840 --> 10:44.110
in a council office or at Nonnatus.

10:44.160 --> 10:47.110
You do know he's a
relative of Fred's?

10:47.160 --> 10:48.710
I had no idea.

10:48.760 --> 10:52.270
And Mrs Mills may be frail,
but her pride's strong.

10:52.320 --> 10:55.110
We must help her keep hold
of it as long as she can.

10:55.160 --> 10:56.550
I just want to help.

10:56.600 --> 10:58.150
I see he suffers with bedsores and,

10:58.200 --> 11:01.990
well, this would be one
thing off their plates.

11:02.040 --> 11:05.600
Sometimes we have to wait for
our help to be asked for.

11:06.840 --> 11:10.030
Nurse Crane wanted a tick against
every name on the list.

11:10.080 --> 11:14.200
Then, with the greatest of respect,
Nurse Crane will have to be patient.

11:16.720 --> 11:21.190
Now, everyone, because we can't care
for you in the Maternity Home,

11:21.240 --> 11:23.950
we're going to visit you
daily in your own homes.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.590
But if there is anything
that concerns you,

11:26.640 --> 11:28.710
you telephone us immediately.

11:28.760 --> 11:31.590
Your husbands are expecting
you, we've informed them all.

11:31.640 --> 11:35.510
Er, Mr Smith will pick you
up himself - he's on his way.

11:35.560 --> 11:39.510
Mrs Lawes? Dr Turner will see
you now. Please come through.

11:39.560 --> 11:41.150
I thought we was goners.

11:41.200 --> 11:45.310
It's all been very
upsetting, I must say.

11:45.360 --> 11:46.990
What a little darling.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.670
And yours.

11:48.720 --> 11:50.550
She's lovely, Shirley.

11:50.600 --> 11:53.700
Did you hear what Auntie
Goldilocks said?

11:55.760 --> 11:58.100
Marion, are you all right?

12:02.240 --> 12:04.040
She's beautiful.

12:05.200 --> 12:06.510
Can you believe it?

12:06.560 --> 12:09.070
We don't see each other for
years, then here we are -

12:09.120 --> 12:10.670
daughters on the same day.

12:10.720 --> 12:12.390
That's fate, that is.

12:12.440 --> 12:15.230
You probably don't remember
Shirley from school, do you?

12:15.280 --> 12:17.350
Take Baby, Godfrey.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.340
I want to get home.

12:21.880 --> 12:24.070
Well, that's us, then, Shirley.

12:24.120 --> 12:26.150
Oh, right. You on the phone?

12:26.200 --> 12:29.790
I don't suppose there's much
point. We're moving to Basildon.

12:29.840 --> 12:32.150
That's even more reason
for a good old natter.

12:32.200 --> 12:34.590
School's a long time ago, Shirley.

12:34.640 --> 12:36.910
We've both got busy lives now.

12:36.960 --> 12:38.700
Right you are.

12:50.400 --> 12:53.140
~ Your usual, dear?
~ Thank you, Miss.

13:03.440 --> 13:05.750
~ Will there be anything else?
~ Oh, no, Miss.

13:05.800 --> 13:08.200
Thank you, you're very kind.

13:17.160 --> 13:20.270
MUSIC: Only the Lonely by Roy Orbison

13:20.320 --> 13:24.070
You sure you don't want me
to stay? Delia won't mind.

13:24.120 --> 13:26.190
Don't be ridiculous...

13:26.240 --> 13:29.320
even if you do so obviously
prefer her company to mine.

13:32.800 --> 13:34.870
Patsy, I'm quite all right.

13:34.920 --> 13:37.310
No-one was hurt.

13:37.360 --> 13:39.990
Besides, I need to read
my copy of Vogue -

13:40.040 --> 13:42.830
there's a waiting list
for it after me.

13:42.880 --> 13:44.630
Go!

13:44.680 --> 13:47.350
I'll try to be quiet coming back.

14:26.680 --> 14:28.420

14:31.040 --> 14:33.840
I sometimes feel as if we're ghosts.

14:35.160 --> 14:38.260
Half with each other,
but mostly without.

14:39.280 --> 14:43.390
I think it would be easier to do what
everyone's so bloody insistent on

14:43.440 --> 14:47.120
and get married and just accept
that you and I can never be.

14:48.400 --> 14:51.830
Delia, do you think I can bear it?

14:51.880 --> 14:55.380
I think you cope better

Do you think it's wise for the
children to be carrying turnips

16:05.200 --> 16:06.630
with lighted candles?

16:06.680 --> 16:08.550
Well, it is a lantern parade.

16:08.600 --> 16:12.350
It is the turnips' glow that

16:12.400 --> 16:14.070

No, dear, of course we don't.

Do not speak for the Pagans.

16:18.160 --> 16:23.310
They say Halloween is the night that
the dead return to walk among us.

~ Which we have absolutely no evidence for.
~ You mustn't worry, dear.

16:26.760 --> 16:29.470
Jesus came back from the
dead and did miracles.

16:29.520 --> 16:32.080

I'd like to see a ghost.

You can put your hand through

16:38.800 --> 16:42.280
I've never touched a cloud but
I bet it feels like candyfloss.

16:43.560 --> 16:45.750
Glenda Severs, come back at once.

16:45.800 --> 16:48.870
My mother's dead and I
should like to see her.

16:48.920 --> 16:50.910
Will you bring her
back for Halloween?

16:50.960 --> 16:52.700
Glenda Severs.

16:57.920 --> 17:01.190
I don't think either of us
actually heard you say "no".

17:01.240 --> 17:04.319
Am I the authority on

17:09.800 --> 17:11.270
~ Fred.
~ Uh-huh.

17:11.319 --> 17:14.349
Do you think you might find
the time to visit Mr Mills?

17:14.400 --> 17:18.109
I know he and Mrs Mills are
on their own a good deal.

17:18.160 --> 17:21.630
I'm sure your friendly face now and
then would be much appreciated...

17:21.680 --> 17:23.589
if you get the time.

17:23.640 --> 17:25.950
Oh, Sister, I'm so glad I caught you.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.270
I couldn't sleep last
night for worrying

17:28.319 --> 17:31.070
about how I'd rather put my foot
in it with Mr and Mrs Mills.

17:31.120 --> 17:32.710
You mustn't upset yourself.

17:32.760 --> 17:35.830
A friend of a friend, a nurse,
she's making a study of bedsores

17:35.880 --> 17:40.230
and I thought it might be useful
for you to help Mr Mills.

17:40.280 --> 17:43.750
She advises against cleaning the
sores with hydrogen peroxide.

17:43.800 --> 17:46.150
She can't be suggesting
we do nothing?

17:46.200 --> 17:48.910
She seems to have had success
by simply turning the patients

17:48.960 --> 17:50.670
every two hours.

17:50.720 --> 17:53.670
Of course, I'll read these
but I just don't know

17:53.720 --> 17:56.030
if I could manage to
visit every two hours.

17:56.080 --> 17:58.220
Then might I help you?

17:59.240 --> 18:02.030
Now, how are we doing
on my laundry take-up?

18:02.080 --> 18:05.550
G-Getting there, Nurse
Crane. Pushing on.

18:05.600 --> 18:09.590
I believe it was you who said,
"Softly, softly, catchee monkey."

18:09.640 --> 18:11.990
Mmm. Not too soft, mind,

18:12.040 --> 18:13.980
or monkey scarpers.

18:34.480 --> 18:36.670
I must say, I'm rather surprised.

18:38.400 --> 18:40.670

18:46.680 --> 18:48.030

18:48.080 --> 18:51.640
Though if you heard Ian, you'd
think she'd be called Princess.

18:55.000 --> 18:59.070
Oh! Glad to see you're
concentrating on security.

18:59.120 --> 19:02.630
Well, now that you've made
me all nervous, Fred...

19:02.680 --> 19:05.870
Sister Monica Joan is doing
something with turnips

19:05.920 --> 19:08.230
and she wants some nice
ribbon to hang them on.

19:08.280 --> 19:10.830
Right, well, if you're hanging
them and they're hollow,

19:10.880 --> 19:14.310
then the half inch should
be strong enough, but...

19:14.360 --> 19:17.360
take the inch wide,
be on the safe side.

19:19.840 --> 19:21.990
My dad's cousin...

19:22.040 --> 19:24.590
he's not too good these days.

19:24.640 --> 19:28.230
I haven't been in as
much as I should have.

19:28.280 --> 19:32.640
I've left things and now I don't
know quite where to start.

19:33.680 --> 19:35.680
Fred, you just go.

19:36.680 --> 19:38.550
It's just, oh...

19:38.600 --> 19:41.390
I'm no good at the old chitchat.

19:41.440 --> 19:43.040
Oh, Fred.

19:46.120 --> 19:49.230
I had that dream again last night.

19:49.280 --> 19:51.110
You know, the one I get,

19:51.160 --> 19:54.150
the one, the one I had
at the end of the war.

19:54.200 --> 19:56.390
When I came home?

19:56.440 --> 19:58.310
And I could smile again.

Now, Mr Mills, this is Nurse Gilbert.

20:15.120 --> 20:17.510
She has some very
interesting suggestions

20:17.560 --> 20:19.270
as to how we might help you.

20:19.320 --> 20:21.550
By turning you every few hours,

20:21.600 --> 20:24.270
we should relieve some of the
pressure on your bedsores.

20:24.320 --> 20:26.950
We hope you'll be more
comfortable as a result of it.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.110
No, no, no, no, don't
trouble yourself.

20:29.160 --> 20:31.470
Oh, Nurse, if you could make
him more comfortable...

20:31.520 --> 20:33.350
We'll do our best, Mrs Mills.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.630
In the meantime, I'm afraid
you'll have to put up

20:35.680 --> 20:37.470
with seeing a little more of us.

20:37.520 --> 20:40.390
Let's pop you on your side, Mr Mills.

20:46.280 --> 20:48.220
(One, two, three.)

20:51.360 --> 20:54.790
Now then, Deborah, what have you
got to be grizzling about, hey?

20:54.840 --> 20:56.800
BABY FUSSES

20:58.240 --> 21:01.150
What is it, Sister?

21:01.200 --> 21:03.870
There's a blueness to her lips.

21:03.920 --> 21:06.950
I would like Doctor to
have a little look at her.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.270
May I use your telephone?

21:13.800 --> 21:16.110
My old dad loved that picture house.

21:16.160 --> 21:17.910
It's where he met my mum.

21:17.960 --> 21:20.030
Same for me and Gert.

21:20.080 --> 21:22.190
Oh! Oh, let me help, Mrs Mills.

21:22.240 --> 21:25.280
Oh, no, dear. It's just
lovely you're both here.

21:27.920 --> 21:30.390
(She's very nice, Frederick.)

21:31.360 --> 21:33.430

21:33.480 --> 21:36.070
~ 50 years married, we are.

21:40.560 --> 21:42.070
That's lovely.

21:42.120 --> 21:45.150
And you each know what the other's
thinking before you even think it.

21:45.200 --> 21:47.830
And you don't need to talk, even.

21:47.880 --> 21:51.640
Me and my Bert weren't together that
long, but we was just as happy.

22:00.520 --> 22:04.590
I'm going to have Deborah seen
by the Hospital for Sick Children.

22:04.640 --> 22:08.950
I can't be sure, but I'm picking
up what may be a heart murmur.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.790
Oh, Lord.

22:10.840 --> 22:12.830
Oh, Mrs Smith, worrying won't help.

22:12.880 --> 22:15.590
Great Ormond Street has
some wonderful doctors.

22:15.640 --> 22:18.870
The hospital has a
specialist heart unit.

22:18.920 --> 22:22.020
Mrs Smith, we will
find out what's wrong.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.630
Oh...

22:30.680 --> 22:33.350
I thought I'd save you a journey.

22:35.440 --> 22:37.630

22:50.360 --> 22:52.630
Oh, whatever's the matter?

22:52.680 --> 22:54.470
I can't worry Tommy.

22:54.520 --> 22:57.390
You're right and that's
why you must be helped.

22:57.440 --> 22:59.550
Please, Mrs Mills...

22:59.600 --> 23:01.470
let me help you.

23:01.520 --> 23:03.150

~ But they're for Tommy.

23:15.920 --> 23:18.230
I shan't take from his care.

23:18.280 --> 23:20.430
We have enough care for both of you.

23:20.480 --> 23:22.220

23:26.080 --> 23:29.390
Gert kept all that worry to herself,

23:29.440 --> 23:32.510
because she didn't
want to upset Tommy.

23:32.560 --> 23:36.520
They couldn't live without each
other, you can see it, can't you?

23:39.920 --> 23:41.990
You need a hot drink.

23:54.120 --> 23:56.120
You made your point.

23:59.280 --> 24:01.230
Turkish coffee.

24:01.280 --> 24:04.710
My son, Derek, brought it back from
a holiday and I've been saving it.

24:04.760 --> 24:07.400
He says the secret's hot milk.

24:08.400 --> 24:09.990
And these cups...

24:10.040 --> 24:13.510
Well, these are what the
Italians are using in Soho.

24:13.560 --> 24:16.030
So consider yourself spoiled.

24:20.680 --> 24:22.270
Gert will get good care.

24:22.320 --> 24:24.190
The Nonnatuns will make sure of that.

24:24.240 --> 24:26.390
And we'll look in on them all we can.

24:26.440 --> 24:28.840
Thank you for what you done.

24:30.600 --> 24:32.940
I should be getting back...

24:33.800 --> 24:37.350
I meant to put a bicycle
chain on one of the bikes.

24:37.400 --> 24:40.140
It needs to be done before tonight.

24:41.440 --> 24:42.710
Fred?

24:43.680 --> 24:47.270
We're too old to be silly
about this, aren't we?

24:47.320 --> 24:49.590
Now either you like me...

24:50.400 --> 24:51.990
.. or you don't.

24:52.040 --> 24:53.590
I do.

24:53.640 --> 24:55.550
Oh, I do.

24:55.600 --> 24:57.940
But I know how hard it is.

24:58.560 --> 25:00.760
You can't let them go...

25:01.520 --> 25:04.320
.. and they can't let you go either.

25:06.040 --> 25:10.200
Fred, I've known him since 16.

25:11.680 --> 25:13.310
I know.

25:13.360 --> 25:15.300
All your life, Vi.

25:33.200 --> 25:34.830
How is she?

25:34.880 --> 25:36.220
Please.

25:39.400 --> 25:43.320
Professor Gribben oversees
the heart and lung unit here.

25:45.760 --> 25:50.080
He knows more about the infant heart
than almost anyone in the world.

25:51.320 --> 25:53.350
Deborah couldn't be in better hands.

25:53.400 --> 25:55.150
But what is it?

25:55.200 --> 25:57.540
What's the matter with her?

25:58.240 --> 26:00.550
She has a heart murmur.

26:00.600 --> 26:02.940
What we don't know is why.

26:03.640 --> 26:06.350
They can't make a diagnosis
without gauging

26:06.400 --> 26:09.550
the blood pressure within her heart.

I'm at a crucial stage.

27:05.760 --> 27:07.630
What was on there?

I'm trying to think

~ Hello!
~ Oh, hello!

27:37.560 --> 27:41.160
Did you find out about
my mother? Is she coming?

27:41.480 --> 27:44.550
Supernatural beings...

27:44.600 --> 27:48.630
are not mine to give
assurances on behalf of.

27:48.680 --> 27:51.020
I've written her a letter.

27:51.880 --> 27:54.620
You will give it to her, won't you?

27:55.560 --> 27:57.630
She might not recognise me, you see.

27:57.680 --> 27:59.350
She died when I was born.

27:59.400 --> 28:02.270
Glenda, dear, does your
father know you're here?

28:02.320 --> 28:05.790
He don't care about me, he's
got Maureen and the new baby.

28:05.840 --> 28:08.840
Besides, I've got to
get back to school.

28:10.480 --> 28:11.880
Oh.

28:13.320 --> 28:16.960
How exactly do you propose
communicating with the departed?

28:18.560 --> 28:21.550
~ Leonora Severs, departed?
~ HE CHUCKLES

28:21.600 --> 28:25.100
The only place she's passed
on to is Liverpool.

28:30.160 --> 28:34.150
This is where the hole is, between
the lower two chambers.

28:34.200 --> 28:36.630
Please, I don't want
to see that picture.

28:36.680 --> 28:38.230
I'm so sorry.

28:38.280 --> 28:42.320
I thought it might help explain what
Professor Gribben is suggesting.

28:44.240 --> 28:46.590
I know how difficult this must be.

28:46.640 --> 28:48.240
Her heart...

28:49.160 --> 28:51.190
.. it's her soul, isn't it?

28:51.240 --> 28:53.070
Her nature.

28:53.120 --> 28:55.190
How will she be complete?

28:55.240 --> 28:59.470
How will she love if it's opened
up, if it's changed in any way?

28:59.520 --> 29:02.270
Her soul won't be touched, my love.

29:02.320 --> 29:06.030
This is a procedure that could
help the blood flow properly

29:06.080 --> 29:09.440
to her lungs in order that
it obtain enough oxygen.

29:10.960 --> 29:13.910
Nothing would be done until
she is at least 18 months.

29:13.960 --> 29:16.750
But if it can wait until then,
why does she need it at all?

29:16.800 --> 29:19.670
It's a matter of
practicality, Mrs Smith.

29:19.720 --> 29:22.110
She's too small.

29:22.160 --> 29:24.870
If she were older and
you were agreeable,

29:24.920 --> 29:27.110
the surgeons would operate now.

29:27.160 --> 29:29.710
That's how much she needs it?

29:29.760 --> 29:32.110
Without the shunt operation,

29:32.160 --> 29:35.360
the fear is Deborah may
not survive infancy.

29:39.840 --> 29:41.380
Mr Severs?

29:43.560 --> 29:45.430
Glenda's father?

29:45.480 --> 29:47.350
What's happened? Is she all right?

29:47.400 --> 29:50.710
Please don't be alarmed and
forgive me tracking you down.

29:50.760 --> 29:53.830
Glenda seems to think
her mother's passed away

29:53.880 --> 29:57.070
and is hoping her ghost
will return on Halloween.

29:57.120 --> 29:58.950
That won't be possible, will it?

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
Even if it were possible,
if you follow.

30:05.240 --> 30:07.510
That woman...

30:07.560 --> 30:09.630
still wreaking havoc.

30:10.560 --> 30:12.270
As far as I'm concerned,

30:12.320 --> 30:15.620
my wife, Maureen, she's
Glenda's mother now.

30:16.680 --> 30:19.950
It's not my business, I know, but
Glenda wants to see her very much.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.750
See her?

30:21.800 --> 30:24.270
Leonora ran out on her
when she was three months.

30:24.320 --> 30:27.190
Oh, Mr Severs, I had no idea.

30:27.240 --> 30:29.910
Well, it's not something
a man wants to talk about,

30:29.960 --> 30:32.360
how his wife cheated on him.

30:33.560 --> 30:36.590
But I loved that little kid
since the day she was born,

30:36.640 --> 30:38.950
just as if she were my own.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.990
and I'd rather she mourned
a ghost than know the truth,

30:42.040 --> 30:45.740
that her mother never even
wrote to ask after her.

30:54.680 --> 30:57.150
It's a nasty lesion, Mrs Mills.

30:57.200 --> 31:00.230
I'm going to arrange for you
to be seen by a specialist.

31:00.280 --> 31:02.830
I just want some cream for it.

31:02.880 --> 31:04.670
You'll be seen at The London

31:04.720 --> 31:08.030
and we'll make sure Nurse
Gilbert can go with you.

31:08.080 --> 31:10.270
I'll be in touch as soon as I can.

31:10.320 --> 31:12.230
Thank you, Dr Turner.

31:12.280 --> 31:15.150
Tommy can't manage on his own.

31:15.200 --> 31:17.190
No-one will be managing alone.

31:17.240 --> 31:19.470
Sister Mary Cynthia will
look after Mr Mills

31:19.520 --> 31:22.270
while I'm with you at the hospital.

31:22.320 --> 31:24.080
(Oh, right.)

31:29.760 --> 31:32.100
Thought I'd find you here.

31:34.960 --> 31:37.430
I hate to think of her alone.

31:38.440 --> 31:40.910
God watches over all of us...

31:41.640 --> 31:44.510
.. even when we think he's forgotten.

31:44.960 --> 31:47.300
She's got an angel's kiss.

31:50.120 --> 31:52.950
The little birthmark,
on her right leg.

31:53.000 --> 31:56.360
My granny used to call it
a kiss from the angels...

31:58.520 --> 32:00.460
.. for protection.

32:01.520 --> 32:04.320
Sounds like she knew a thing or two.

32:12.160 --> 32:15.190
When you return from memory
lane, Nurse Franklin,

32:15.240 --> 32:17.190
may I suggest you organise an area

32:17.240 --> 32:20.540
in which we can store
those records securely.

32:22.960 --> 32:25.310
Mrs Dent wants some details
for her birth book.

32:25.360 --> 32:26.560
Mmm.

32:28.240 --> 32:32.040
I'd quite forgotten little
Jackie had a birth mark.

32:32.840 --> 32:36.240
It's faded now, but it
was rather distinctive.

32:46.040 --> 32:48.110
SHE CLEARS HER THROAT

33:11.480 --> 33:13.160
SHE SIGHS

33:32.160 --> 33:34.750
Oh!

33:34.800 --> 33:36.520
SHE GROANS

33:40.440 --> 33:44.910
SISTER EVANGELINA GASPS FOR AIR

33:44.960 --> 33:47.500
Sister Evangelina? What is it?

33:49.560 --> 33:52.030
I've made a terrible mistake.

33:54.160 --> 33:57.230
I've made a dreadful,
dreadful mistake.

33:57.280 --> 34:00.710
What could you possibly do that
could cause such distress?

34:00.760 --> 34:03.630
The Dent baby is with the Smiths

34:03.680 --> 34:07.030
and the Smith baby is with the Dents.

34:07.080 --> 34:09.719
SHE SOBS

34:13.840 --> 34:15.830
All the other babies were tagged.

34:15.880 --> 34:19.989
It's just those two because of the
fire and I had them in my arms,

34:20.040 --> 34:22.429
and I knew which was which!

34:22.480 --> 34:24.880
~ SHE WHIMPERS
~ Thought I did!

34:25.920 --> 34:28.630
I muddled them up.

34:28.679 --> 34:31.550
I gave each baby to the wrong mother.

34:32.800 --> 34:34.469
What am I going to do?

34:34.520 --> 34:37.060
What on earth am I going to do?

34:39.400 --> 34:40.600
Ah!

34:45.560 --> 34:47.120
Thank you.

34:49.840 --> 34:53.830
Godfrey Smith had surgery for a
broken arm a couple of years ago.

34:53.880 --> 34:55.469
We'll have his details.

34:55.520 --> 34:57.710
Yes, here we are.

34:57.760 --> 34:59.900
Blood group A Negative.

35:01.240 --> 35:03.790
And Marion Smith...

35:03.840 --> 35:06.270
blood group, O Negative.

35:06.320 --> 35:08.190
And the baby?

35:08.240 --> 35:11.190
Here we are. Deborah Smith.

35:11.240 --> 35:12.790
Blood group...

35:12.840 --> 35:14.380
O Positive.

35:15.320 --> 35:20.030
Two rhesus negative parents cannot
make a rhesus positive baby.

35:20.080 --> 35:22.070
It is not possible.

35:22.120 --> 35:24.550
What of the Dents, Mrs Turner?

35:24.600 --> 35:27.200
We only have Mrs Dent's details.

35:29.760 --> 35:31.150
O Positive.

35:31.200 --> 35:34.240
Well, that explains our
rhesus positive baby.

35:36.040 --> 35:38.670
Debbie belongs to the Dents

35:38.720 --> 35:41.470
~ and Jackie to the Smiths.
~ SHE SOBS

35:41.520 --> 35:44.030
This is not your mistake alone.

35:44.080 --> 35:47.870
We are a team and we
will resolve this.

35:47.920 --> 35:49.760
How?

35:55.280 --> 35:59.190
I hear you've been rather prodded
and poked today, Mrs Mills.

35:59.240 --> 36:00.830
I'm sorry about that.

36:00.880 --> 36:03.990
Oh, it's no matter, sir.

36:04.040 --> 36:07.340
The lesion is what we
call a fungating wound.

36:08.520 --> 36:10.470
Are you in pain?

36:10.520 --> 36:12.070
Oh...

36:12.120 --> 36:14.230
it's not too bad, sir.

36:14.280 --> 36:16.190
Considerable pain, sir.

36:16.240 --> 36:18.870
I'm sorry, Mrs Mills, but you are.

36:18.920 --> 36:22.220
We'd expect that with
a lesion of this type.

36:22.880 --> 36:25.350
I'm afraid it has revealed...

36:25.400 --> 36:28.400
a cancer beneath your
skin, Mrs Mills.

36:31.080 --> 36:33.910
We'd like to perform
a radical mastectomy.

36:33.960 --> 36:37.110
The procedure would involve
removing the breast...

36:37.160 --> 36:38.670
Oh, God.

36:38.720 --> 36:41.470
.. and underlying pectoralis muscle

36:41.520 --> 36:45.040
and a number of underarm lymph nodes.

36:47.480 --> 36:49.470
That way we'll know, without doubt,

36:49.520 --> 36:52.520
if it's spread to the
lymphatic system.

36:53.160 --> 36:57.120
If it's spread to the lymph nodes,
we'll follow up with radiotherapy.

36:58.480 --> 37:00.670
I-It's an awful lot to take in.

37:00.720 --> 37:02.950
I think we'll need some time.

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
We'd want to bring
Mrs Mills in quickly.

37:07.360 --> 37:09.510
Am I dying, sir?

37:09.560 --> 37:11.900
~ Without surgery, yes.
~ Oh.

37:13.080 --> 37:15.680
A-And with it, am I still dying?

37:18.840 --> 37:22.480
You'll have less pain and
more time, Mrs Mills.

37:36.040 --> 37:38.910
Lightning Chance might
do well tomorrow.

37:38.960 --> 37:41.310
Gert said no more bets.

37:41.360 --> 37:42.830
Quite right, too.

37:42.880 --> 37:44.390
She was always the brains.

37:44.440 --> 37:47.550
Mmm. I was the looks.

37:47.600 --> 37:49.310
Mmm, to be fair,

37:49.360 --> 37:51.230
that's Gert, too.

37:52.080 --> 37:55.390
~ You're a lucky man, Tommy.
~ So are you.

37:55.440 --> 37:57.390
Mrs Gee's a lovely lady.

37:57.440 --> 37:59.750
Yes, she is.

37:59.800 --> 38:01.280
She is.

38:03.160 --> 38:07.670
I think her Bert must've been like
you, cos she can't forget him.

38:07.720 --> 38:09.860
Well, does she have to?

38:11.680 --> 38:14.750
I can't compete with
someone who's perfect.

38:14.800 --> 38:17.110
Nobody's perfect.

38:17.160 --> 38:19.270
Love makes us that way.

38:19.320 --> 38:22.420
You have to open your
heart to them first.

38:27.440 --> 38:29.710
We'll get back and we'll
put the kettle on

38:29.760 --> 38:32.710
and we'll have a nice cup of tea and
we'll think about what to do next.

38:32.760 --> 38:36.990
You mustn't worry and you won't
be on your own for any of it.

38:37.040 --> 38:40.350
Do you need to sit down, Mrs
Mills? O-O-Or some water?

38:40.400 --> 38:42.310
I thought he'd go first.

38:42.360 --> 38:44.830
I always wanted it that way,

38:44.880 --> 38:47.790
that I should always
be there for him...

38:47.840 --> 38:50.520
that he would never be alone.

38:51.600 --> 38:54.150
Oh, Nurse...

38:54.200 --> 38:55.830
what do I say to him?

38:55.880 --> 38:57.310
You mustn't think that way.

38:57.360 --> 39:00.710
~ You must only think of getting better.
~ Yes.

39:00.760 --> 39:02.360
(Oh, Tommy.)

39:12.280 --> 39:14.350
I think we must come
straight out with it.

39:14.400 --> 39:15.870
There is no way to soften the blow.

39:15.920 --> 39:18.720
~ KNOCK AT DOOR
~ I think you're right.

39:20.720 --> 39:23.310
Are the parents on their way?

39:23.360 --> 39:26.150
I should face these
poor people alone.

39:26.200 --> 39:27.830
This is not your mistake.

39:27.880 --> 39:29.590
And it's not your punishment.

39:29.640 --> 39:31.270
This must be about a resolution.

39:31.320 --> 39:34.190
~ What will condemnation solve?
~ It's what I deserve.

39:34.240 --> 39:36.670
You deserve a medal.

39:36.720 --> 39:39.550
You put all those babies
before your own safety.

39:39.600 --> 39:41.670
Because of you, all are well.

39:41.720 --> 39:43.830
I've destroyed two families.

39:43.880 --> 39:46.990
Sister Evangelina, you are my family.

39:47.040 --> 39:50.270
We will find a way
through... all of us.

39:50.320 --> 39:53.120
The Smiths, the Dents and Nonnatus.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.720
DOOR OPENS

39:59.840 --> 40:02.070
I'm always saying what
a small world it is.

40:02.120 --> 40:05.510
I'm afraid it's no coincidence that
you're all here together, Mr Dent.

40:05.560 --> 40:07.510
Paperwork, is it? For the babies?

40:07.560 --> 40:08.830
Please sit down.

40:08.880 --> 40:11.230
Our baby's in the hospital.
What's this all about?

40:11.280 --> 40:12.990
The hospital?

40:13.040 --> 40:14.590
What's wrong?

40:14.640 --> 40:16.670
Marion, what's wrong?

40:16.720 --> 40:19.190
I'm afraid we have some very...

40:19.240 --> 40:20.980
difficult news.

40:21.760 --> 40:25.550
In the evacuation following the
fire in the Maternity Home,

40:25.600 --> 40:28.400
a very grave mistake was made.

40:31.640 --> 40:36.790
I didn't put the name tags on the
babies before I took them out.

40:36.840 --> 40:40.430
I thought I knew who was who...

40:40.480 --> 40:42.680
but I'm afraid I didn't.

40:44.960 --> 40:47.310
Your babies were muddled.

40:47.360 --> 40:49.470
Mrs Dent...

40:49.520 --> 40:51.430
your baby was born with a birthmark,

40:51.480 --> 40:54.780
which I know you've seen
is no longer there.

40:56.920 --> 40:58.520
Mrs Smith...

40:59.560 --> 41:04.550
.. baby Deborah now has a birthmark
on her lower right leg,

41:04.600 --> 41:06.740
the size of a sixpence?

41:07.840 --> 41:10.110
But the nurse said it could fade,

41:10.160 --> 41:13.030
so it stands to reason
they can come up an' all?

41:13.080 --> 41:15.510
For protection...

41:15.560 --> 41:17.360
an angel's kiss.

41:18.680 --> 41:22.200
We've confirmed our mistake
from your blood groups.

41:23.880 --> 41:27.760
It's not biologically possible
for Deborah to be your child.

41:29.960 --> 41:31.710
I can't take this in.

41:31.760 --> 41:35.350
We know how very distressing this is.

41:35.400 --> 41:38.590
I'm sorry that you are faced with
the possibility of losing a child

41:38.640 --> 41:40.390
that you've grown to love.

41:40.440 --> 41:45.550
Our hope is that, because events
happened relatively swiftly,

41:45.600 --> 41:48.510
bonds could be re-established.

41:48.560 --> 41:52.710
You gave our baby to them while
we've been to hell with theirs?

41:52.760 --> 41:55.500
And we've given our love to yours.

41:56.600 --> 41:58.000
Please.

41:59.320 --> 42:01.230
Tell me what's wrong with my baby?

42:01.280 --> 42:03.630
Deborah has a heart condition

42:03.680 --> 42:06.920
that stops her blood
receiving enough oxygen.

42:08.840 --> 42:12.070
I wish I could say you have
all the time in the world,

42:12.120 --> 42:16.550
but a decision will need to be
made over Deborah's surgery.

42:16.600 --> 42:18.550
Surgery?

42:18.600 --> 42:20.350
But she's just a tot.

42:20.400 --> 42:22.950
She needs a great deal of care.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.630
She's very delicate.

42:25.680 --> 42:27.230
She needs her mother.

42:27.280 --> 42:29.230
She needs someone capable.

42:29.280 --> 42:30.830
And you think I'm not?

42:30.880 --> 42:33.110
You never took anything seriously.

42:33.160 --> 42:35.790
Not school, or life.

42:35.840 --> 42:39.960
And I can't imagine you with a baby
with a heart that does not work.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.200
Oh, come along, Godfrey.

42:45.920 --> 42:49.400
I've got to be home in case the
hospital telephones, not here.

42:52.960 --> 42:55.630
This is an awful lot to take in.

42:55.680 --> 42:58.070
Go home, Mr and Mrs Dent,

42:58.120 --> 43:02.160
where you may have peace
to think matters over.

43:06.280 --> 43:08.510
I can't see the good of it.

43:08.560 --> 43:10.710
The operation, I mean.

43:10.760 --> 43:13.750
I'd be away, I wouldn't
know for how long.

43:13.800 --> 43:15.830
I don't want to be away.

43:15.880 --> 43:18.220
I want to be here for you.

43:18.960 --> 43:21.350
You must have the operation, Gert.

43:21.400 --> 43:23.470
But it might all be for nothing.

43:23.520 --> 43:25.830
They might not get the cancer out.

43:25.880 --> 43:28.080
We'll pray that they do.

43:29.760 --> 43:31.830
I don't want to lose you...

43:31.880 --> 43:34.880
not until every last fight's lost.

43:36.400 --> 43:38.590
We go through what we
go through together.

43:38.640 --> 43:41.180
We live for one another, Gert.

43:42.040 --> 43:45.520
Be with me as long as
ever you can, please.

43:49.040 --> 43:50.360
Mmm.

43:51.400 --> 43:53.940
Her little heart's not working.

43:55.320 --> 43:58.320
And we're not in the
hospital with her.

43:59.520 --> 44:01.660
I can't hardly take it.

44:07.040 --> 44:09.580
How can I love Jackie so much?

44:11.280 --> 44:13.270
She ain't even mine.

44:13.320 --> 44:15.120
She's my world.

44:16.680 --> 44:19.220
I never knew happiness like it.

44:20.520 --> 44:23.920
Everything's different
now she's in our lives.

44:25.040 --> 44:27.110
I keep thinking...

44:27.160 --> 44:28.710
are they kind?

44:28.760 --> 44:32.360
Do they love her? The way
we love Jackie, I mean.

44:34.840 --> 44:37.380
It can't be made right, can it?

44:39.360 --> 44:42.560
Whatever we do, we've
lost our little baby.

44:47.600 --> 44:50.600
They say God works
in mysterious ways.

44:51.280 --> 44:53.420
He tests us with pain.

44:54.200 --> 44:56.630
And yet, he's sparing us. He...

44:56.680 --> 44:59.220
He's giving us another chance.

45:00.880 --> 45:04.030
Course, it will hurt
in the short term,

45:04.080 --> 45:07.030
but in the long run, we'll
forget all of this.

45:07.080 --> 45:10.070
We're blessed. We can
have our baby back.

45:10.120 --> 45:12.550
Our baby is in Great Ormond Street.

45:12.600 --> 45:14.070
She's not.

45:14.120 --> 45:15.390
She's with those fools.

45:15.440 --> 45:17.110
You said it yourself!

45:17.160 --> 45:18.870
~ And, well, she's perfect.
~ Stop it!

45:18.920 --> 45:21.830
Don't ask me to bring up a child
who's not even mine, who...

45:21.880 --> 45:24.670
~ who won't even live beyond infancy.
~ She will live.

45:24.720 --> 45:27.230
~ She'll have the surgery and she'll live.
~ She's not ours.

45:27.280 --> 45:28.670
Shirley can't look after her.

45:28.720 --> 45:30.460
Not like I can.

45:37.880 --> 45:40.680
SOFT CRYING

45:44.800 --> 45:46.960
Useless, useless!

45:48.600 --> 45:50.720
SOBBING: You fool!

45:53.920 --> 45:56.510
My thoughts exactly.

45:56.560 --> 46:01.080
I have always found that drainer
an exercise in precarious balance.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.270
I never liked this china.

46:14.080 --> 46:15.620
Whereas...

46:17.960 --> 46:20.910
.. YOU are irreplaceable...

46:20.960 --> 46:23.760
and we would be so lost without you.

46:24.960 --> 46:28.280
SISTER EVANGELINA CRIES

46:42.200 --> 46:45.520
~ You need to wrap up, the mist's coming in.
~ Ow!

46:47.880 --> 46:49.310
Oh, promise me, Sister.

46:49.360 --> 46:51.470
Promise me you'll look after him.

46:51.520 --> 46:55.950
I promise. And already, his bedsore
is looking a good deal better.

46:56.000 --> 46:59.000
Think only of getting
well, Mrs Mills.

47:02.120 --> 47:05.870
We live for each other,
we always have.

47:05.920 --> 47:08.460
We will have more time, Tommy.

47:09.360 --> 47:11.230
Hurry back to me.

47:12.400 --> 47:14.120
~ Hmm?
~ Yes.

47:41.760 --> 47:45.920
Pack, and non-pack, remember
what we do with our lanterns?

47:48.880 --> 47:50.590
Where is she? Where's Mother?

47:50.640 --> 47:53.030
Glenda, dear child.

47:53.080 --> 47:55.820
I cannot bring your mother to you.

47:58.240 --> 48:01.550
But your father's here and
he very much wants to see you.

48:01.600 --> 48:04.760
~ He don't care about me.
~ Don't talk that way.

48:06.880 --> 48:08.620
Glenda. Glenda!

48:10.400 --> 48:12.710
I came to see you, didn't I?

48:12.760 --> 48:15.300
See this parade you're part of.

48:18.160 --> 48:20.560
I'm sorry you miss your mum.

48:22.760 --> 48:25.230
She'd have wanted to see you tonight.

48:25.280 --> 48:27.880
She'd have loved you so much.

48:30.080 --> 48:32.750
Why don't you talk about her?

48:32.800 --> 48:34.480
It hurts.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.350
But I will, love, when you're older.

48:38.400 --> 48:40.940
I wanted her to watch over me.

48:42.040 --> 48:44.190
That's my job, you see.

48:44.240 --> 48:46.110
And your mum...

48:46.160 --> 48:49.990
made me promise her that,
just before she passed on.

48:50.040 --> 48:56.150
She said, "My little girl is the
most precious thing in the world

48:56.200 --> 49:00.640
"and you're to treasure her every
single minute of every day."

49:02.640 --> 49:04.230
And I do.

49:04.280 --> 49:07.580
But I'm sorry for the
times you don't see it.

49:19.120 --> 49:20.990
We're not dead...

49:21.840 --> 49:24.440
.. and we won't live as we were.

49:25.000 --> 49:28.500
We'll find a way to be
together, I promise you.

49:33.360 --> 49:35.700
I'm on first watch tonight.

49:37.000 --> 49:38.750
Oh, you're staying?

49:38.800 --> 49:41.070
We're to look after you
until Mrs Mills can.

49:41.120 --> 49:43.190
That was our promise.

49:53.040 --> 49:56.270
Hello, Fred. It's nice to see you.

49:56.320 --> 50:00.110
~ What's all this, you having a clear out?
~ Yeah, well, I'm packing it in.

50:00.160 --> 50:02.270
I mean, I've just
been pottering along

50:02.320 --> 50:04.750
and I can't see the point any more.

50:04.800 --> 50:07.590
My son's suggested I stay
with him in Plymouth.

50:07.640 --> 50:09.390
For your holidays?

50:09.440 --> 50:12.270
SHE SIGHS Bit longer than that, Fred.

50:12.320 --> 50:15.320
I mean, what's to be here for, eh?

50:19.680 --> 50:21.680
I'm after a padlock.

50:22.600 --> 50:24.440
Oh. Er...

50:32.520 --> 50:35.960
I could let you have a bit off
the price on this one, cos...

50:38.680 --> 50:39.990
Fred?

50:40.040 --> 50:42.110
I don't want you going to Plymouth.

50:42.160 --> 50:44.750
Don't want you going anywhere
unless it's with me.

50:44.800 --> 50:48.630
I don't care if I have to share you
with Bert, or the memory of him.

50:48.680 --> 50:50.150
Violet...

50:51.640 --> 50:53.910
.. I wish we were a pair.

50:55.480 --> 50:57.350
I wish you'd marry me.

50:57.400 --> 51:00.070
Well, why don't you ask me, then?

51:00.720 --> 51:02.230
I just did.

51:02.280 --> 51:04.030
Oh, yeah!

51:04.080 --> 51:06.270
Well, then...

51:06.320 --> 51:08.150
yes.

51:08.200 --> 51:09.640
Yes!

51:12.520 --> 51:15.630
You know I said I'd give you a
bit off the price of that padlock?

51:15.680 --> 51:18.220
It's cos I don't have the key.

51:20.760 --> 51:22.190
Well...

51:22.240 --> 51:25.840
we'll have to stay here
forever, then, won't we?

51:27.280 --> 51:30.350
There's nothing more you
could have done, my love.

51:30.400 --> 51:32.790
I have to make sure it
never happens again.

51:32.840 --> 51:35.710
The Maternity Home
must be above error.

51:35.760 --> 51:38.920
We have the name tags, the
identification records.

51:44.960 --> 51:47.360
I couldn't love Angela more.

51:48.480 --> 51:51.220
Not even if I'd given birth to her.

51:53.280 --> 51:56.280
It's the same as I
feel about Timothy.

51:58.040 --> 52:01.150
And if you were in Marion
or Shirley's place?

52:01.200 --> 52:03.510
If you had the choice?

52:03.560 --> 52:06.870
So different, what those
poor parents are facing.

52:06.920 --> 52:08.680
Angela is ours.

52:09.960 --> 52:13.470
There are a billion other babies out
there, but I don't think of them.

52:13.520 --> 52:15.120
Only of her.

52:15.920 --> 52:18.560
It's not about reason, or logic.

52:20.680 --> 52:24.580
(We shouldn't be talking
like this in front of her.)

52:25.760 --> 52:27.750
Oh, do you have to?

52:27.800 --> 52:31.750
Not strictly, but it embarrasses
you and that keeps us entertained.

52:31.800 --> 52:35.390
I feel rather different about
saving your bacon now, Mum.

52:35.440 --> 52:37.030
Ooh.

52:37.080 --> 52:41.480
Well, perhaps we'll feel different
about your pocket money on Saturday.

52:44.560 --> 52:47.670
You photograph each
baby when it's born.

52:47.720 --> 52:50.590
That way, no-one will
ever lose their mothers

52:50.640 --> 52:52.230
and you won't have to feel rotten

52:52.280 --> 52:55.910
~ about something that wasn't your fault.
~ Oh, Tim.

52:55.960 --> 52:57.630
Thank you.

52:57.680 --> 53:02.760
Now my finger definitely won't
be over the lens this time.

53:04.160 --> 53:08.480
So we have the chance...

53:11.080 --> 53:13.880
.. of a picture worth keeping.

53:22.320 --> 53:24.710
Say "cheese".

53:24.760 --> 53:26.880
Cheese.

53:36.600 --> 53:38.870
She will live, won't she?

53:40.240 --> 53:42.510
They don't make promises.

53:43.040 --> 53:45.780
She'll need so much care, Shirley.

53:47.280 --> 53:48.750
We were friends once.

53:48.800 --> 53:51.200
We're not children any more.

53:52.040 --> 53:54.150
Deborah may not live.

53:54.200 --> 53:55.950
Why would you take that on?

53:56.000 --> 53:58.750
Because I carried her for nine months

53:58.800 --> 54:01.600
and I loved her more with every day.

54:02.840 --> 54:05.230
I don't want another
minute without my baby.

54:05.280 --> 54:07.520
JACKIE FUSSES

54:13.800 --> 54:15.830
You carried Jackie.

54:15.880 --> 54:17.750
How could you be without her?

54:17.800 --> 54:19.940
I can't think that way.

54:20.960 --> 54:22.830
It isn't right, what's happened,

54:22.880 --> 54:25.310
but it's happened and we
have to just go on with it.

54:25.360 --> 54:27.680
JACKIE CRIES

54:28.840 --> 54:30.980
I don't want a choice.

54:31.600 --> 54:34.640
I don't want to wonder and
I don't want to compare.

54:36.120 --> 54:38.920
I want to love what feels like mine.

54:42.560 --> 54:45.100
You can't even stop her crying.

54:56.600 --> 54:59.000
You couldn't manage Deborah.

55:02.480 --> 55:04.350
I can't let her down.

55:04.400 --> 55:06.310
She needs me.

55:06.360 --> 55:08.800
JACKIE CRIES LOUDER

55:16.000 --> 55:17.940
They both need us.

55:19.160 --> 55:22.030
Do you think I could
bear to lose Jackie?

55:22.080 --> 55:24.620
The thought of it makes me ill.

55:38.160 --> 55:40.310
This ain't in my head, Marion.

55:40.360 --> 55:42.360
This is in my heart.

55:43.360 --> 55:45.700
I need to be with my baby.

55:59.720 --> 56:01.750
I'm sorry, what I said...

56:01.800 --> 56:03.600
the other night.

56:04.560 --> 56:07.660
Truth is, I always
wanted to be like you.

56:08.760 --> 56:11.150
You always seemed happy.

56:11.200 --> 56:13.140
It's because I was.

56:14.840 --> 56:16.910
I had my best friend.

56:44.920 --> 56:48.600
We go forward, Sister. Together...

56:50.960 --> 56:52.700
.. as a family.

57:13.840 --> 57:18.310
Light will often pierce the darkness
when we least expect it.

57:18.360 --> 57:22.200
And if we're fortunate,
when we need it most...

57:23.760 --> 57:25.870
.. science can pave the way.

57:25.920 --> 57:28.830
But we need human hands to guide us

57:28.880 --> 57:33.000
and love to illuminate
the path that lies ahead.

57:35.760 --> 57:37.560
Hi. Ah!

57:40.480 --> 57:42.160
Oh!

57:53.880 --> 57:56.870
TRIXIE: The one thing that
makes me feel better...

57:56.920 --> 57:59.390
is a glass of Scotch.

57:59.440 --> 58:01.910
I'm aware there are better
times for me to be going off

58:01.960 --> 58:03.910
to do a fortnight's
course at The London.

58:03.960 --> 58:05.910
Have you managed to prepare
any food for Neil?

58:05.960 --> 58:07.990
~ I can't face boiling milk.
~ SHE RETCHES

58:08.040 --> 58:10.830
Oh, this is more than morning
sickness, Mrs Turner!

58:10.880 --> 58:14.910
The boiler has died from inattention.

58:14.960 --> 58:18.070
I may yet suffer the same fate.

58:18.120 --> 58:20.750
PATSY: Oh, Delia. You don't
want to end up in some...

58:20.800 --> 58:23.670
filthy hole, living cheek by
jowl with a lot of students.

58:23.720 --> 58:26.590
FRED: Did you get the letter
about my lady friend?

58:26.640 --> 58:29.240
Yes, Dad, I did.
