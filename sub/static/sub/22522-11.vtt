15:46.942 --> 15:49.968
...have now effectively been silenced.

15:55.784 --> 15:57.718
And we've done worse than that...

15:57.920 --> 16:00.320
...because there persists
till this day...

16:00.522 --> 16:04.117
...a traffic in the dead bodies
of whales.

16:04.326 --> 16:07.420
There are humans who gratuitously
hunt and slaughter whales...

16:07.630 --> 16:12.567
...and market the products
for dog food or lipstick.

16:13.469 --> 16:17.769
Many nations understand why
whale murder is monstrous...

16:17.973 --> 16:20.464
...but the traffic
continues chiefly...

16:20.676 --> 16:24.237
...by Japan and Norway
and the Soviet Union.

16:25.147 --> 16:27.342
<i>We use "monster" to describe</i>
<i>an animal...</i>

16:27.583 --> 16:30.746
<i>... somehow different from us,</i>
<i>somehow scary.</i>

16:31.553 --> 16:33.521
<i>But who's the more monstrous...</i>

16:33.722 --> 16:35.815
<i>... the whales,</i>
<i>who ask to be left alone...</i>

16:36.025 --> 16:38.687
<i>... to sing their rich</i>
<i>and plaintive songs...</i>

16:38.961 --> 16:42.920
...or the humans, who set out
to hunt them and destroy them...

16:43.132 --> 16:47.228
...and have brought many whale species
close to the edge of extinction?

16:49.638 --> 16:53.165
We're interested in communication
with extraterrestrial intelligence.

16:53.375 --> 16:55.275
Wouldn't a good beginning be...

16:55.477 --> 16:58.275
...better communication
with terrestrial intelligence...

16:58.480 --> 17:01.847
...with other human beings
of different cultures and languages...

17:02.051 --> 17:04.246
...with the great apes,
with the dolphins...

17:04.453 --> 17:06.944
...but particularly with the whales?

17:35.951 --> 17:39.546
<i>To survive, a whale must</i>
<i>know how to do things.</i>

17:39.755 --> 17:42.189
<i>This knowledge is stored</i>
<i>in two principal ways...</i>

17:42.391 --> 17:45.986
<i>... in the whale's genes</i>
<i>and in their very large brains.</i>

17:46.195 --> 17:48.060
<i>We can think of their</i>
<i>genes and brains...</i>

17:48.263 --> 17:51.164
<i>... as something like libraries</i>
<i>inside their bodies.</i>

17:51.367 --> 17:54.131
<i>The information in the DNA,</i>
<i>the genetic information...</i>

17:54.336 --> 17:56.133
<i>... includes how to nurse...</i>

17:56.338 --> 17:58.499
<i>... how to convert</i>
<i>shrimp into blubber...</i>

17:58.707 --> 18:02.643
<i>... how to hold your breath on a dive</i>
<i>one kilometer below the surface.</i>

18:02.845 --> 18:05.678
<i>The information in the brains,</i>
<i>the learned information...</i>

18:05.881 --> 18:07.439
<i>... involves such things as...</i>

18:07.649 --> 18:08.707
<i>... who's your mother...</i>

18:08.917 --> 18:12.375
<i>... or what the meaning is of</i>
<i>that song we're hearing just now.</i>

18:15.557 --> 18:18.549
<i>The gene library</i>
<i>of whales and people...</i>

18:18.761 --> 18:20.251
<i>... and everybody else on Earth...</i>

18:20.462 --> 18:22.054
<i>... is made of DNA.</i>

18:22.264 --> 18:24.357
<i>The only function</i>
<i>of this complex molecule...</i>

18:24.566 --> 18:28.400
<i>... is to store and copy information.</i>

18:32.408 --> 18:36.367
<i>We see here the set of instructions</i>
<i>in human DNA...</i>

18:36.578 --> 18:41.242
<i>... written in a language billions</i>
<i>of years older than any human tongue.</i>

18:41.450 --> 18:43.384
<i>Each colored cluster of atoms...</i>

18:43.585 --> 18:47.021
<i>... is a letter in the genetic alphabet:</i>
<i>The language of life.</i>

18:47.222 --> 18:48.689
<i>There are billions of letters...</i>

18:48.891 --> 18:52.156
<i>... many billions of bits</i>
<i>of information.</i>

18:52.661 --> 18:54.788
<i>If you came from somewhere</i>
<i>very different...</i>

18:54.997 --> 18:58.057
<i>... you wouldn't be able</i>
<i>to specify a whale or a person...</i>

18:58.267 --> 19:01.703
<i>... in a game of 20 Questions</i>
<i>with only 20 bits.</i>

19:01.904 --> 19:05.305
<i>But a game called</i>
<i>10 Billion Questions...</i>

19:05.507 --> 19:07.202
<i>... might just work.</i>

19:07.409 --> 19:08.740
<i>Every organism on Earth...</i>

19:08.944 --> 19:11.708
<i>... contains as its</i>
<i>inheritance and legacy...</i>

19:11.914 --> 19:13.779
<i>... a portable library.</i>

19:13.982 --> 19:18.351
<i>And the more bits of information</i>
<i>you have, the more you can do.</i>

19:21.990 --> 19:24.185
<i>The simplest organism, a virus...</i>

19:24.393 --> 19:26.623
<i>... needs only about 10,000 bits.</i>

19:26.829 --> 19:30.890
<i>Equal to the amount of information</i>
<i>on one page of an average book.</i>

19:31.099 --> 19:32.828
<i>These are all the instructions</i>
<i>it needs...</i>

19:33.035 --> 19:35.868
<i>... to infect some other organism</i>
<i>and to reproduce itself...</i>

19:36.071 --> 19:39.472
<i>... which are the only things</i>
<i>that viruses are any good at.</i>

19:39.675 --> 19:43.202
<i>A bacterium uses roughly</i>
<i>a million bits of information...</i>

19:43.412 --> 19:45.175
<i>... about 100 printed pages.</i>

19:45.380 --> 19:47.644
<i>Bacteria have a lot more</i>
<i>to do than viruses.</i>

19:47.850 --> 19:52.378
<i>They're not thoroughgoing parasites.</i>
<i>Bacteria have to make a living.</i>

19:56.124 --> 19:59.252
<i>What about a free-swimming</i>
<i>one-celled amoeba?</i>

19:59.461 --> 20:01.725
<i>These creatures are</i>
<i>also microscopic...</i>

20:02.197 --> 20:04.358
<i>... but in the realm</i>
<i>of one-celled animals...</i>

20:04.566 --> 20:05.999
<i>... they are giants.</i>

20:06.201 --> 20:09.227
<i>The whales of the microbial world.</i>

20:09.438 --> 20:13.966
<i>Each contains about 400 million bits</i>
<i>in its DNA...</i>

20:14.176 --> 20:18.237
<i>... the equivalent of about</i>
<i>80 volumes of 500 pages each.</i>

20:18.447 --> 20:21.075
<i>That's how much information</i>
<i>it takes to make an amoeba...</i>

20:21.283 --> 20:26.220
<i>... a creature like a small city</i>
<i>wandering through a drop of water.</i>

20:29.992 --> 20:32.153
<i>And what about a whale</i>
<i>or a human being?</i>

20:32.361 --> 20:34.226
Well, the answer seems to be...

20:34.429 --> 20:38.297
...that there's 5 billion bits.

20:38.500 --> 20:42.527
Five billion bits of information
in our encyclopedia of life...

20:42.738 --> 20:45.605
...in the nucleus of every one
of our cells.

20:45.807 --> 20:49.368
So if written out in,
say, ordinary English...

20:49.578 --> 20:52.206
...those instructions,
that information...

20:52.414 --> 20:56.282
...would fill 1000 volumes.

20:56.485 --> 20:57.577
Think of it.

20:57.786 --> 21:02.018
In every one of the 100 trillion
cells in your body...

21:02.224 --> 21:05.193
...there's the contents of a complete
library of instructions...

21:05.394 --> 21:09.387
...on how to make every part of you.
Those cells are smart.

21:09.598 --> 21:12.089
If this were my gene library...

21:12.301 --> 21:15.202
...it would contain everything
my body knows how to do...

21:15.404 --> 21:17.133
...without being taught.

21:17.339 --> 21:20.137
The ancient information...

21:20.342 --> 21:25.177
...is written in exhaustive,
careful, redundant detail.

21:25.380 --> 21:29.043
How to laugh, how to sneeze,
how to walk...

21:29.251 --> 21:31.651
...how to recognize patterns,
how to reproduce...

21:31.853 --> 21:33.912
...how to digest an apple.

21:34.423 --> 21:37.085
If written out in
the language of chemistry...

21:37.292 --> 21:38.850
...what would the instructions...

21:39.061 --> 21:41.791
...for digesting the sugar
in an apple look like?

21:41.997 --> 21:44.022
Well, let's see.

21:45.100 --> 21:47.728
Amino acid synthesis,
polypeptide chains...

21:47.936 --> 21:52.270
...transfer RNA, genetic code,
enzyme expression...

21:52.474 --> 21:55.034
...enzyme phosphorylation.
We're getting warm.

21:55.243 --> 21:59.111
Hexose monophosphate shunt,
citric acid cycle...

21:59.314 --> 22:01.874
Here we are.
Anaerobic glycolysis.

22:02.084 --> 22:03.711
Now, eating an apple...

22:03.919 --> 22:06.479
...may seem like
a very simple thing...

22:07.222 --> 22:08.951
...but it's not.

22:09.157 --> 22:13.059
In fact, if I consciously had to
remember and direct...

22:13.261 --> 22:17.595
...all the chemical steps required to
get energy out of food...

22:17.799 --> 22:19.960
...I'd probably starve to death.

22:20.168 --> 22:24.935
And yet, even a bacterium
can do anaerobic glycolysis.

22:25.140 --> 22:30.077
That's why apples rot.
It's lunchtime for the bacteria.

22:30.278 --> 22:33.805
They and we and all
the creatures in between...

22:34.016 --> 22:37.315
...possess similar
genetic instructions.

22:37.519 --> 22:40.010
Our separate gene libraries...

22:40.222 --> 22:42.952
...have many pages in common...

22:43.158 --> 22:46.252
...which is another reminder
of the deep interconnection...

22:46.461 --> 22:49.157
...of all living things
on our planet because of...

22:49.364 --> 22:51.389
...a common evolutionary heritage.

22:54.236 --> 22:56.761
Our present human technology...

22:56.972 --> 23:01.875
...can duplicate only a tiny fraction
of the intricate biochemistry...

23:02.077 --> 23:06.309
...which our bodies seem
to perform so effortlessly.

23:06.515 --> 23:09.075
But we're just beginning
the study of biochemistry.

23:09.284 --> 23:13.448
Evolution has had
billions of years of practice.

23:14.423 --> 23:16.857
The DNA knows.

23:18.060 --> 23:22.656
Now, what if what we had
to do was so complicated...

23:22.864 --> 23:26.891
...that even several billion bits
of information wasn't enough?

23:27.102 --> 23:30.594
What if, for example, the environment
were changing so fast...

23:30.806 --> 23:34.264
...that the pre-coded
genetic encyclopedia...

23:34.476 --> 23:37.934
...which may have served us perfectly
well in the past is now...

23:38.146 --> 23:41.240
...not perfectly adequate?

23:41.450 --> 23:43.008
Why, then...

23:43.218 --> 23:47.484
...even a gene library of
1000 volumes wouldn't be enough.

23:47.689 --> 23:50.886
That's why we have brains.

23:54.362 --> 23:56.626
Like our other organs,
the brain has evolved...

23:56.832 --> 23:59.300
...increasing over millions of years...

23:59.501 --> 24:02.493
...in complexity
and information content.

24:02.704 --> 24:07.141
Its structure reflects all the stages
through which it has passed.

24:07.576 --> 24:12.275
The brain has evolved
from the inside out.

24:12.481 --> 24:16.110
Deep inside is the oldest part,
the so-called brain stem.

24:16.718 --> 24:19.346
It conducts many of the basic
biological functions...

24:19.554 --> 24:21.988
...including the rhythms of life...

24:22.190 --> 24:25.023
...like heartbeat and respiration.

24:25.227 --> 24:28.196
The higher functions
of the brain have evolved...

24:28.396 --> 24:31.957
...in three successive stages
according to a provocative insight...

24:32.167 --> 24:35.000
...by the American biologist
Paul MacLean.

24:35.203 --> 24:39.537
You see, capping the brain stem is
the so-called R-complex...

24:39.741 --> 24:41.504
"R" for reptile.

24:41.710 --> 24:43.439
It's the seat of...

24:43.678 --> 24:46.875
...aggression, ritual,
territoriality...

24:47.082 --> 24:48.947
...and social hierarchies.

24:49.151 --> 24:52.314
It evolved some hundreds of millions
of years ago...

24:52.521 --> 24:54.819
...in our reptilian ancestors.

24:55.023 --> 24:59.790
So, deep inside our brains
is something rather like...

24:59.995 --> 25:02.293
...the brain of a crocodile.

25:02.497 --> 25:06.160
Surrounding the R-complex is
the limbic system...

25:06.368 --> 25:07.596
...or mammal brain.

25:07.803 --> 25:10.101
It evolved some tens of millions
of years ago...

25:10.539 --> 25:13.030
...in ancestors who were
mammals all right...

25:13.241 --> 25:17.678
...but not yet primates
like monkeys or apes.

25:17.879 --> 25:21.440
It's a major source
of our moods and emotions...

25:21.650 --> 25:24.949
...our concern and care
for the young.

25:25.153 --> 25:28.987
And then, finally,
on the outside of the brain...

25:29.591 --> 25:32.651
...living in a kind of
uneasy truce with...

25:32.861 --> 25:36.558
...the more primitive brains beneath,
is the cerebral cortex...

25:36.765 --> 25:39.165
...evolved millions of years ago...

25:39.367 --> 25:41.858
...in ancestors who were primates.

25:55.183 --> 25:57.651
This is the point of embarkation...

25:57.853 --> 25:59.946
...for all our cosmic journeys.

26:00.155 --> 26:01.850
The cerebral cortex...

26:02.057 --> 26:05.254
...where matter is transformed
into consciousness.

26:05.460 --> 26:09.760
Here, comprising more than
two-thirds of the brain mass...

26:09.965 --> 26:13.765
...is the realm both of intuition
and of critical analysis.

26:13.969 --> 26:17.166
It's here that we have
ideas and inspirations.

26:17.372 --> 26:19.135
Here that we read and write.

26:19.341 --> 26:22.674
Here that we do mathematics and music.

26:22.878 --> 26:26.575
The cortex regulates
our conscious lives.

26:26.781 --> 26:29.716
It is the distinction
of our species...

26:29.918 --> 26:31.909
...the seat of our humanity.

26:32.120 --> 26:34.384
Art and science live here.

26:34.589 --> 26:38.491
Civilization is a product
of the cerebral cortex.

26:41.096 --> 26:42.222
<i>Behind the forehead...</i>

26:42.430 --> 26:45.365
<i>... are the frontal lobes</i>
<i>of the cerebral cortex.</i>

26:45.567 --> 26:48.127
<i>They may be where we</i>
<i>anticipate events...</i>

26:48.336 --> 26:50.566
<i>... where we figure out the future.</i>

26:50.772 --> 26:53.002
<i>But if we can foresee</i>
<i>an unpleasant future...</i>

26:53.208 --> 26:55.142
<i>... we can take steps to avoid it.</i>

26:55.343 --> 26:57.368
<i>Down here in the frontal lobes...</i>

26:57.579 --> 27:00.139
<i>... may be the means</i>
<i>of ensuring human survival...</i>

27:00.348 --> 27:03.078
<i>... if we have the wisdom</i>
<i>to pay attention.</i>

27:06.021 --> 27:10.458
<i>Inside the cerebral cortex is</i>
<i>the microscopic structure of thought.</i>

27:10.659 --> 27:14.254
<i>The language of the brain is not</i>
<i>the DNA language of the genes.</i>

27:14.462 --> 27:17.989
<i>What we know is encoded</i>
<i>in cells called neurons...</i>

27:18.199 --> 27:19.530
<i>... tiny switching elements...</i>

27:19.734 --> 27:23.534
<i>... every connection representing</i>
<i>one bit of information.</i>

27:23.738 --> 27:26.935
<i>How many neurons do each of us have?</i>
<i>Maybe 100 billion.</i>

27:27.142 --> 27:30.441
<i>Comparable to the number of stars</i>
<i>in the Milky Way galaxy.</i>

27:30.645 --> 27:35.173
<i>And there are something like</i>
<i>100 trillion neural connections.</i>

27:37.252 --> 27:41.586
This intricate and marvelous
network of neurons...

27:41.790 --> 27:45.556
...has been called
an enchanted loom...

27:45.760 --> 27:48.558
...where millions of
flashing shuttles...

27:48.763 --> 27:51.459
...weave a dissolving pattern.

27:51.666 --> 27:55.227
Even in sleep, the brain is pulsing
and throbbing and flashing...

27:55.437 --> 27:58.338
...with the complex business
of human life:

27:58.540 --> 28:01.566
Dreaming, remembering,
figuring things out.

28:01.776 --> 28:04.904
Our thoughts, our visions,
our fantasies...

28:05.113 --> 28:08.105
...have a tangible, physical reality.

28:08.316 --> 28:10.113
What does a thought look like?

28:10.318 --> 28:14.254
Well, it's made of hundreds
of electrochemical impulses.

28:15.056 --> 28:16.717
Over there, for example, is...

28:16.925 --> 28:18.324
...a spark of a memory.

28:18.526 --> 28:19.788
Maybe...

28:19.995 --> 28:23.954
...the smell of lilacs on a country
road in childhood.

28:24.165 --> 28:28.499
And there goes a bit of
an anxious all points bulletin.

28:28.703 --> 28:32.195
Perhaps, "Where did I leave my keys?"

28:34.909 --> 28:38.037
<i>The neurons store sounds too...</i>

28:38.246 --> 28:40.043
<i>... and snatches of music.</i>

28:40.248 --> 28:44.582
<i>Whole orchestras play</i>
<i>inside our heads.</i>

28:49.991 --> 28:54.257
<i>The landscape of the human</i>
<i>cerebral cortex is deeply furrowed.</i>

28:54.462 --> 28:55.895
<i>There's a good reason for it.</i>

28:56.097 --> 28:57.587
<i>These convolutions...</i>

28:57.799 --> 29:01.792
<i>... greatly increase the surface area</i>
<i>available for information storage...</i>

29:02.003 --> 29:05.302
<i>... in a skull of limited size.</i>

29:09.644 --> 29:12.807
<i>The world of thought is</i>
<i>divided into two hemispheres.</i>

29:13.014 --> 29:15.744
<i>Over there is the right hemisphere</i>
<i>of the cerebral cortex.</i>

29:15.950 --> 29:18.612
<i>It's mainly responsible</i>
<i>for pattern recognition...</i>

29:18.820 --> 29:21.914
<i>... intuition, sensitivity,</i>
<i>creative insights.</i>

29:22.123 --> 29:24.318
<i>And over here is</i>
<i>the left hemisphere...</i>

29:24.526 --> 29:28.690
<i>... presiding over rational, analytic</i>
<i>and critical thinking.</i>

29:34.269 --> 29:37.363
These are the two sides...

29:37.572 --> 29:41.599
...the dual strengths,
the essential opposites...

29:41.810 --> 29:43.778
...that characterize human thinking.

29:43.978 --> 29:46.538
Before us are the means...

29:46.748 --> 29:50.809
...both for generating ideas
and for testing their validity.

29:51.019 --> 29:55.319
There's a continuous dialogue between
the two hemispheres of the brain...

29:55.523 --> 29:59.892
...channeled through this immense
bundle of nerve fibers...

30:00.095 --> 30:02.859
...which is called
the corpus callosum.

30:03.064 --> 30:07.398
It's a bridge between
creativity and analysis...

30:07.602 --> 30:11.663
...both of which are necessary
if we are to understand the world.

30:13.208 --> 30:17.110
<i>The information content of</i>
<i>the human brain expressed in bits...</i>

30:17.312 --> 30:19.678
<i>... is comparable to the number</i>
<i>of connections between...</i>

30:19.881 --> 30:21.348
<i>... the neurons in the cortex...</i>

30:21.549 --> 30:23.449
<i>... about 100 trillion bits...</i>

30:23.651 --> 30:26.449
<i>... 10 to the 14th connections.</i>

30:26.654 --> 30:30.112
<i>If written out in English,</i>
<i>it would fill 20 million volumes...</i>

30:30.325 --> 30:32.793
<i>... as many as in the</i>
<i>world's largest libraries.</i>

30:32.994 --> 30:36.555
<i>The equivalent of 20 million volumes</i>
<i>worth of information...</i>

30:36.764 --> 30:39.130
<i>... is inside the heads</i>
<i>of every one of us.</i>

30:39.334 --> 30:44.067
<i>The brain is a very big place</i>
<i>in a very small space.</i>

30:46.141 --> 30:50.601
Most of the books in the brain are
up here in the cerebral cortex.

30:50.812 --> 30:53.713
Down there, in the basement
of the brain...

30:53.915 --> 30:55.940
...are the functions
that our ancestors...

30:56.151 --> 30:58.142
...mainly depended on for survival:

30:58.353 --> 31:01.345
Aggression, child rearing, sex...

31:01.556 --> 31:04.047
...the willingness to
follow leaders blindly.

31:04.259 --> 31:07.660
Lots of things that we can still
recognize in our lives today.

31:07.862 --> 31:09.955
Of the higher brain functions...

31:10.165 --> 31:11.792
...some of them, like...

31:12.000 --> 31:14.025
...reading, writing, speaking...

31:14.235 --> 31:19.138
...seem to be located in particular
places in the cerebral cortex.

31:19.340 --> 31:21.535
On the other hand, each memory...

31:21.743 --> 31:26.146
...seems to be stored in many
separate locales in the brain.

31:26.347 --> 31:29.043
Old memories are in lots of places.

31:35.924 --> 31:37.755
Here is one of my earliest memories.

(CLICKS ON RADIO)

31:56.277 --> 31:59.644
(MUSIC PLAYS)

32:14.195 --> 32:16.390
That was a long time ago.

32:18.399 --> 32:21.095
But its imprint has not faded...

32:21.302 --> 32:24.271
...in the library of this brain.

32:31.813 --> 32:35.146
But the brain does much more
than just recollect.

32:35.350 --> 32:36.578
It inter-compares.

32:36.784 --> 32:39.184
It synthesizes. It analyzes.

32:39.387 --> 32:41.855
It generates abstractions.

32:46.995 --> 32:49.725
<i>The simplest thought,</i>
<i>like the concept of the number one...</i>

32:49.931 --> 32:52.229
<i>... has an elaborate,</i>
<i>logical underpinning.</i>

32:52.433 --> 32:54.094
<i>The brain has its own language...</i>

32:54.302 --> 32:57.169
<i>... for testing the world's</i>
<i>structure and consistency.</i>

32:57.372 --> 32:59.932
<i>But we never see the machinery</i>
<i>of logical analysis...</i>

33:00.141 --> 33:01.972
<i>... only the conclusions.</i>

33:03.878 --> 33:06.608
There is so much more
that we must figure out...

33:06.814 --> 33:08.475
...than the genes can know.

33:08.683 --> 33:11.117
That's why the brain library...

33:11.319 --> 33:14.755
...has 10,000 times
more information in it...

33:14.956 --> 33:16.389
...than the gene library.

33:16.591 --> 33:21.290
Our passion for learning is
the tool for our survival.

33:26.567 --> 33:30.503
<i>And unlike the musty bindings</i>
<i>of our gene library...</i>

33:30.705 --> 33:33.139
<i>... in which hardly a word</i>
<i>changes in a century...</i>

33:33.341 --> 33:37.004
<i>... the brain library is</i>
<i>made of loose-leaf books.</i>

33:37.211 --> 33:41.170
<i>We're constantly adding</i>
<i>new pages and new volumes.</i>

33:49.257 --> 33:52.920
Emotions and ritual
behavior patterns...

33:53.127 --> 33:54.924
...are built very deeply into us.

33:55.129 --> 33:58.030
They're part of our humanity.

33:58.232 --> 34:00.792
But they're not
characteristically human.

34:01.002 --> 34:02.993
Many other animals have feelings.

34:03.204 --> 34:06.833
What distinguishes our
species is thought.

34:07.041 --> 34:11.910
The cerebral cortex is,
in a way, a liberation.

34:12.113 --> 34:14.240
We need no longer be trapped...

34:14.449 --> 34:17.475
...in the genetically inherited
behavior patterns...

34:17.685 --> 34:20.017
...of lizards and baboons:

34:20.221 --> 34:22.849
Territoriality and aggression...

34:23.057 --> 34:25.457
...and dominance hierarchies.

34:25.660 --> 34:27.127
We are, each of us...

34:27.328 --> 34:30.855
...largely responsible for what
gets put into our brains...

34:31.065 --> 34:35.263
...for what, as adults,
we wind up caring for...

34:35.470 --> 34:37.062
...and knowing about.

34:37.271 --> 34:40.297
No longer at the mercy
of the reptile brain...

34:40.508 --> 34:43.909
...we can change ourselves.

34:44.112 --> 34:46.376
Think of the possibilities.

35:18.012 --> 35:20.003
<i>The city, like the brain...</i>

35:20.214 --> 35:22.682
<i>... has evolved in successive stages.</i>

35:22.884 --> 35:25.682
<i>The vestiges of its past are</i>
<i>still retained...</i>

35:25.887 --> 35:29.186
<i>... among the constructions</i>
<i>of the present.</i>

35:37.498 --> 35:40.331
<i>A city like New York developed</i>
<i>from a small center...</i>

35:40.535 --> 35:44.471
<i>... and slowly grew leaving many</i>
<i>of the old parts still functioning.</i>

35:44.672 --> 35:47.641
<i>Some of the major streets</i>
<i>date to the 17th century.</i>

35:47.842 --> 35:50.470
<i>Its commercial hub,</i>
<i>to the 18th century.</i>

35:50.678 --> 35:53.044
<i>The water and gas works,</i>
<i>to the 19th.</i>

35:53.247 --> 35:57.547
<i>The electrical and communications</i>
<i>systems, to the 20th century.</i>

36:07.895 --> 36:10.887
<i>The city has evolved</i>
<i>much faster than the brain.</i>

36:11.098 --> 36:12.963
<i>Only 10,000 years ago...</i>

36:13.167 --> 36:15.397
<i>... the human brain looked exactly</i>
<i>as it does today...</i>

36:15.603 --> 36:17.070
<i>... and we were just as smart.</i>

36:17.271 --> 36:18.670
<i>But there were no cities...</i>

36:18.873 --> 36:23.674
<i>... only a few scattered encampments</i>
<i>in the vast primordial forests.</i>

36:23.878 --> 36:25.675
<i>Today, it's just the opposite.</i>

36:25.880 --> 36:30.817
<i>Forests and grasslands often seem like</i>
<i>scattered islands in a sea of cities.</i>

36:32.453 --> 36:34.580
<i>If you were an observer</i>
<i>from an alien world...</i>

36:34.789 --> 36:36.950
<i>... you would've noticed that</i>
<i>something complicated...</i>

36:37.158 --> 36:40.150
<i>... has been happening</i>
<i>over the last few thousand years.</i>

36:40.361 --> 36:43.228
<i>It might take you a while</i>
<i>to figure out the details...</i>

36:43.431 --> 36:45.831
<i>... but you would recognize</i>
<i>by its complexity...</i>

36:46.033 --> 36:48.831
<i>... unmistakable evidence</i>
<i>for intelligent life.</i>

36:49.837 --> 36:51.896
<i>On closer scrutiny,</i>
<i>you might recognize...</i>

36:52.106 --> 36:53.835
<i>... individual, intelligent beings.</i>

36:59.981 --> 37:03.678
<i>The evolution of the city is due</i>
<i>to their conscious activity.</i>

37:04.285 --> 37:07.743
<i>Millions of human beings working,</i>
<i>more or less, together...</i>

37:07.955 --> 37:10.719
<i>... to preserve the city,</i>
<i>to reconstruct it...</i>

37:10.925 --> 37:12.415
<i>... and to change it.</i>

37:26.007 --> 37:28.976
<i>It might be more efficient</i>
<i>if all civic systems...</i>

37:29.176 --> 37:31.940
<i>... were periodically replaced</i>
<i>from top to bottom.</i>

37:32.146 --> 37:33.841
<i>But, as in the brain...</i>

37:34.048 --> 37:36.881
<i>... everything has to work</i>
<i>during the renovation.</i>

37:37.084 --> 37:38.984
<i>So the city mostly adds new parts...</i>

37:39.186 --> 37:42.917
<i>... while the old parts continue,</i>
<i>more or less, to function.</i>

37:46.127 --> 37:48.288
<i>For example, in the 17th century...</i>

37:48.496 --> 37:50.657
<i>... you traveled between</i>
<i>Brooklyn and Manhattan...</i>

37:50.865 --> 37:53.095
<i>... across the East River by ferry.</i>

37:53.301 --> 37:56.828
<i>In the 19th century, the technology</i>
<i>became available to construct...</i>

37:57.038 --> 37:58.835
<i>... a suspension bridge</i>
<i>across the river.</i>

37:59.040 --> 38:02.066
<i>It was built precisely at the site</i>
<i>of the ferry terminal...</i>

38:02.276 --> 38:05.973
<i>... because major thoroughfares</i>
<i>were already converging there.</i>

38:07.214 --> 38:10.342
<i>When it was possible to construct</i>
<i>a tunnel under the river...</i>

38:10.551 --> 38:14.851
<i>... that, too, was built in the same</i>
<i>place and for the same reason.</i>

38:15.056 --> 38:18.822
<i>This use and restructuring of</i>
<i>previous systems for new purposes...</i>

38:19.026 --> 38:22.427
<i>... is very much like the pattern</i>
<i>of biological evolution.</i>

38:22.630 --> 38:25.064
Or consider Third Avenue.

38:25.266 --> 38:26.756
In the 17 th century...

38:26.968 --> 38:30.836
...you made your way uptown
on foot or on horseback.

38:31.339 --> 38:34.069
A little later, there were coaches...

38:34.275 --> 38:37.676
...the horses prancing,
the coachmen cracking their whips.

38:38.279 --> 38:41.942
<i>And then these were replaced</i>
<i>by horse-drawn trolleys...</i>

38:42.149 --> 38:45.516
<i>... clanging along fixed tracks</i>
<i>on this avenue.</i>

38:45.720 --> 38:48.211
<i>Then electrical technology</i>
<i>developed...</i>

38:48.422 --> 38:52.051
<i>... and a great elevated railway line</i>
<i>was constructed...</i>

38:53.027 --> 38:56.827
<i>... called the Third Avenue EI,</i>
<i>which dominated the street...</i>

38:57.031 --> 39:01.400
<i>... until 1954, when it was</i>
<i>utterly demolished.</i>

39:01.602 --> 39:06.539
<i>Anyway, the El was then replaced</i>
<i>by buses and taxicabs...</i>

39:06.807 --> 39:09.037
...which still are the main forms...

39:09.243 --> 39:11.473
...of public transportation
on Third Avenue.

39:12.279 --> 39:15.373
Now as gasoline becomes
a rare commodity...

39:15.583 --> 39:19.110
...the combustion engine will be
replaced by something else.

39:19.320 --> 39:24.257
Maybe public transport
on Third Avenue in the 21 st century...

39:24.792 --> 39:29.525
...will be by, I don't know,
pneumatic tubes or electric cars.

39:30.331 --> 39:34.597
Every step in the evolution
of Third Avenue transport...

39:34.802 --> 39:36.997
...has been conservative...

39:37.204 --> 39:39.365
...following a route
first laid down...

39:39.573 --> 39:41.336
...in the 17 th century.

39:41.542 --> 39:45.638
But the brain is still more
conservative than the city.

39:45.880 --> 39:49.680
If this were the brain, we might have
horse-drawn trolleys...

39:49.884 --> 39:51.579
...and the El and buses...

39:51.786 --> 39:54.277
...all operating simultaneously...

39:54.488 --> 39:57.013
...redundantly, competitively.

39:57.224 --> 40:00.091
The vestiges of earlier history
clearly in evidence.

40:11.172 --> 40:13.606
When our genes could not store...

40:13.808 --> 40:16.538
...all the information necessary
for our survival...

40:16.744 --> 40:19.907
...we slowly invented brains.

40:20.648 --> 40:25.278
But then the time came, maybe
tens of thousands of years ago...

40:25.553 --> 40:27.680
...when we needed to know more than...

40:27.888 --> 40:30.288
...could conveniently be stored
in brains.

40:34.061 --> 40:38.293
<i>So we learned to stockpile</i>
<i>enormous quantities of information...</i>

40:38.499 --> 40:39.989
<i>... outside our bodies.</i>

40:40.201 --> 40:43.170
<i>We are the only species on Earth,</i>
<i>so far as we know...</i>

40:43.370 --> 40:46.396
<i>... to have invented</i>
<i>a communal memory.</i>

40:46.607 --> 40:50.202
<i>The warehouse of that memory</i>
<i>is called the library.</i>

40:52.913 --> 40:54.744
<i>Libraries also have evolved.</i>

40:54.949 --> 40:57.144
<i>The Assyrian library</i>
<i>of Ashurbanipal...</i>

40:57.351 --> 40:59.683
<i>... had thousands of clay tablets.</i>

40:59.887 --> 41:02.788
<i>The celebrated Library of Alexandria</i>
<i>in Egypt...</i>

41:02.990 --> 41:06.118
<i>... consisted of almost</i>
<i>a million papyrus scrolls.</i>

41:06.327 --> 41:09.626
<i>Great modern libraries,</i>
<i>like the New York Public Library...</i>

41:09.830 --> 41:12.822
<i>... contain some 10 million books.</i>

41:15.870 --> 41:20.307
That's more than 10 to the 14th bits
of information in words.

41:20.508 --> 41:24.535
More than 100 trillion bits,
and if we count pictures...

41:24.745 --> 41:28.772
...it's something like 10 to the 15th
bits of information.

41:28.983 --> 41:31.144
Now, that's more than 10,000 times...

41:31.352 --> 41:34.412
...the total number of bits
of information in our genes.

41:34.622 --> 41:36.180
Something like 10 times...

41:36.390 --> 41:39.791
...the total amount of information
in our brains.

41:39.994 --> 41:42.656
If I were to read a book a week...

41:42.863 --> 41:45.559
...for my entire adult lifetime...

41:45.766 --> 41:47.734
...and I lived an ordinary lifetime...

41:47.935 --> 41:49.163
...when I was all done...

41:49.370 --> 41:52.862
...I would've read maybe
a few thousand books.

41:53.073 --> 41:54.335
No more.

41:54.542 --> 41:59.206
In this library,
that's from about here...

42:04.518 --> 42:05.951
...roughly...

42:07.655 --> 42:10.146
...to about here.

42:10.357 --> 42:13.417
But that's only
a 10th of a percent or so...

42:13.627 --> 42:16.323
...of the total number of books
in the library.

42:16.530 --> 42:20.660
The trick is to know
which books to read.

42:22.536 --> 42:25.096
But they're all here.

42:34.415 --> 42:38.442
What an astonishing thing a book is.

42:38.652 --> 42:42.144
It's a flat object made from a tree...

42:42.356 --> 42:46.793
...with flexible parts
on which are imprinted...

42:46.994 --> 42:49.929
...lots of funny dark squiggles.

42:50.130 --> 42:52.360
But one glance at it...

42:52.566 --> 42:55.399
...and you're inside
the mind of another person.

42:55.603 --> 42:59.334
Maybe somebody dead
for thousands of years.

42:59.540 --> 43:01.508
Across the millennia...

43:01.709 --> 43:05.236
...an author is speaking
clearly and silently...

43:05.446 --> 43:08.347
...inside your head, directly to you.

43:08.549 --> 43:12.542
Writing is perhaps the greatest
of human inventions.

43:12.753 --> 43:15.688
Binding together people
who never knew each other.

43:15.890 --> 43:18.654
Citizens of distant epochs.

43:18.859 --> 43:22.226
Books break the shackles of time.

43:22.429 --> 43:27.366
A book is proof that humans
are capable of working magic.

43:27.635 --> 43:30.968
And this room is filled with magic.

43:33.173 --> 43:36.233
Some of the earliest
authors wrote on...

43:36.877 --> 43:39.903
...bones and stones.

43:40.114 --> 43:44.414
Cuneiform writing is the remote
ancestor of the Western alphabet.

43:44.618 --> 43:48.520
It was invented in the Near East
about 5000 years ago.

43:48.722 --> 43:50.349
Its purpose?

43:50.557 --> 43:51.649
To keep records.

43:51.859 --> 43:55.556
Records of the purchase of grain,
the sale of land...

43:55.763 --> 43:59.563
...the triumphs of kings,
the statutes of priests...

43:59.767 --> 44:01.928
...the positions of the stars...

44:02.136 --> 44:04.934
...the prayers to the gods.

44:05.139 --> 44:07.903
This cone was made...

44:08.108 --> 44:10.599
...around the year 2350 B.C.

44:10.811 --> 44:14.941
4300 years ago, there were people
chipping and chiseling away...

44:15.149 --> 44:16.707
...the message on this cone.

44:16.917 --> 44:18.714
What is that message?

44:18.919 --> 44:20.716
It's a prayer.

44:20.921 --> 44:24.379
The inscription on this cylinder...

44:25.392 --> 44:27.656
...honors a king.

44:28.195 --> 44:32.529
Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon,
in the 6th century B.C.

44:32.733 --> 44:36.396
For thousands of years, writing was
chiseled into stone...

44:36.603 --> 44:40.630
...scratched onto wax
or bark or leather...

44:40.841 --> 44:44.743
...painted on bamboo
or silk or paper...

44:44.945 --> 44:48.142
...but always in editions of one copy.

44:48.349 --> 44:50.180
One copy at a time...

44:50.384 --> 44:53.979
...always, except for
inscriptions on monuments...

44:54.188 --> 44:56.247
...for a tiny readership.

45:09.336 --> 45:12.635
But then in China...

45:12.840 --> 45:15.570
...between the 2nd
and the 6th centuries...

45:15.776 --> 45:19.735
...paper, ink and printing
with carved wooden blocks...

45:19.947 --> 45:22.541
...were all invented,
more or less, together...

45:22.750 --> 45:27.687
...permitting many copies of a work
to be made and distributed.

45:27.955 --> 45:31.152
This is Chinese magic...

45:31.358 --> 45:33.383
...from the 12th century.

45:34.895 --> 45:37.329
It took 1000 years for
the idea to catch on...

45:37.531 --> 45:40.659
...in relatively remote
and backward Europe.

45:40.868 --> 45:44.736
Just before the invention
of movable type...

45:45.005 --> 45:47.269
...around the year 1450...

45:47.474 --> 45:50.272
...there were only a few
tens of thousands of books in Europe.

45:50.477 --> 45:53.037
Every one of them handwritten.

45:53.247 --> 45:58.082
Fifty years later, there were
10 million printed books in Europe.

45:58.285 --> 46:02.551
Learning became available to
anyone who could read.

46:02.756 --> 46:05.987
Suddenly, books were being
printed all over the world.

46:06.193 --> 46:09.219
Magic was everywhere.

46:11.031 --> 46:12.794
<i>It is 23 centuries...</i>

46:13.000 --> 46:15.400
<i>... since the founding</i>
<i>of the Alexandrian library.</i>

46:15.936 --> 46:19.770
<i>Since then, 100 generations</i>
<i>have lived and died.</i>

46:19.973 --> 46:22.806
<i>If information were passed on</i>
<i>merely by word of mouth...</i>

46:23.010 --> 46:25.069
<i>... how little we should know</i>
<i>of our own past...</i>

46:25.279 --> 46:27.645
<i>... how slow would be our progress.</i>

46:27.848 --> 46:30.078
<i>Everything would depend on</i>
<i>what we'd been told...</i>

46:30.284 --> 46:31.876
<i>... on how accurate the account.</i>

46:32.086 --> 46:33.883
<i>Ancient learning might be revered...</i>

46:34.088 --> 46:37.182
<i>... but in successive retellings,</i>
<i>it would become muddled...</i>

46:37.391 --> 46:38.790
<i>... and then lost.</i>

46:38.992 --> 46:41.927
<i>Books permit us to</i>
<i>voyage through time...</i>

46:42.129 --> 46:45.121
<i>... to tap the wisdom</i>
<i>of our ancestors.</i>

46:46.834 --> 46:50.201
<i>A library connects us with</i>
<i>the insights and knowledge...</i>

46:50.404 --> 46:53.134
<i>... of the greatest minds</i>
<i>and the best teachers...</i>

46:53.340 --> 46:56.366
<i>... drawn from the whole planet</i>
<i>and from all our history...</i>

46:56.577 --> 46:58.807
<i>... to instruct us without tiring...</i>

46:59.012 --> 47:01.845
<i>... and to inspire us to make</i>
<i>our own contributions...</i>

47:02.049 --> 47:05.712
<i>... to the collective knowledge</i>
<i>of the human species.</i>

47:13.794 --> 47:17.594
There's a fair number
of Gutenberg Bibles...

47:17.798 --> 47:20.665
...and first folios of Shakespeare
in the world...

47:20.868 --> 47:23.200
...but most of the books
you see here...

47:23.403 --> 47:27.772
...are limited editions with
very few surviving copies.

47:27.975 --> 47:29.966
But there also exists in the world...

47:30.177 --> 47:33.544
...mass printings
of paperbound books...

47:33.747 --> 47:37.342
...that I think are still
more wonderful.

47:37.551 --> 47:39.951
For the price of a modest meal...

47:40.154 --> 47:42.884
...you get the history of Rome.

47:43.524 --> 47:47.460
Books are like seeds:
They can lie dormant for centuries...

47:47.661 --> 47:52.325
...but they may also produce flowers
in the most unpromising soil.

47:52.533 --> 47:57.470
These books are the repositories
of the knowledge of our species...

47:57.738 --> 48:00.901
...and of our long
evolutionary journey...

48:01.108 --> 48:04.771
...from genes to brains to books.

48:23.130 --> 48:24.722
<i>Libraries in ancient Egypt...</i>

48:24.932 --> 48:26.900
<i>... bore these words on their walls:</i>

48:27.668 --> 48:31.001
<i>"Nourishment for the soul."</i>

48:31.371 --> 48:35.933
<i>And that's still a pretty fair</i>
<i>assessment of what libraries provide.</i>

48:52.960 --> 48:56.123
<i>Even at night, the city,</i>
<i>like the brain...</i>

48:56.330 --> 48:59.094
<i>... is busy assimilating</i>
<i>and distributing information.</i>

48:59.299 --> 49:01.062
<i>Information keeps it alive...</i>

49:01.268 --> 49:05.466
<i>... and provides the tools to</i>
<i>adapt to changing conditions.</i>

49:07.541 --> 49:08.803
<i>The long human journey...</i>

49:09.009 --> 49:13.275
<i>... from genes to brains</i>
<i>to books continues.</i>

49:17.384 --> 49:19.181
<i>Information itself evolves...</i>

49:19.386 --> 49:23.686
<i>... nurtured by open communication</i>
<i>and free inquiry.</i>

49:26.893 --> 49:29.088
<i>The units of biological</i>
<i>evolution are genes.</i>

49:29.496 --> 49:32.192
<i>The units of cultural</i>
<i>evolution are ideas.</i>

49:32.399 --> 49:34.697
<i>Ideas are transported</i>
<i>all over the planet.</i>

49:34.968 --> 49:36.595
<i>They reproduce through communication.</i>

49:36.937 --> 49:40.168
<i>They are selected by</i>
<i>analysis and debate.</i>

49:40.374 --> 49:44.470
<i>In the last few millennia, something</i>
<i>extraordinary has happened on Earth.</i>

49:45.212 --> 49:48.545
<i>Rich information from</i>
<i>distant lands and peoples...</i>

49:48.749 --> 49:51.240
<i>... has become routinely available.</i>

49:52.686 --> 49:54.847
<i>The number of bits to which</i>
<i>we have access...</i>

49:55.055 --> 49:57.148
<i>... has grown dramatically.</i>

50:02.029 --> 50:04.463
<i>Computers can now store and process...</i>

50:04.665 --> 50:07.691
<i>... enormous amounts of information</i>
<i>extremely rapidly.</i>

50:07.901 --> 50:10.665
<i>In our time, a revolution has begun.</i>

50:10.871 --> 50:12.771
<i>A revolution</i>
<i>perhaps as significant...</i>

50:12.973 --> 50:15.635
<i>... as the evolution</i>
<i>of DNA and nervous systems...</i>

50:15.842 --> 50:17.332
<i>... and the invention of writing.</i>

50:18.478 --> 50:21.845
<i>Direct communication among</i>
<i>billions of human beings...</i>

50:22.049 --> 50:25.246
<i>... is now made possible by</i>
<i>computers and satellites.</i>

50:25.919 --> 50:28.854
<i>The potential for a global</i>
<i>intelligence is emerging.</i>

50:29.056 --> 50:33.254
<i>Linking all the brains on Earth</i>
<i>into a planetary consciousness.</i>

50:37.064 --> 50:39.123
<i>Elsewhere, there may be brains...</i>

50:39.333 --> 50:41.130
<i>... even planetary brains...</i>

50:41.335 --> 50:43.769
<i>... but there will be no brains</i>
<i>quite like ours.</i>

50:43.970 --> 50:47.804
<i>Mutation and natural selection are</i>
<i>basically random processes.</i>

50:48.008 --> 50:49.873
<i>If the Earth were started</i>
<i>over again...</i>

50:50.077 --> 50:52.011
<i>... intelligence might</i>
<i>very well emerge...</i>

50:52.212 --> 50:56.581
<i>... but anything closely resembling</i>
<i>a human being would be unlikely.</i>

50:57.951 --> 51:02.320
<i>On another planet with a different</i>
<i>sequence of random processes...</i>

51:02.522 --> 51:04.217
<i>... to make heredity diversity...</i>

51:04.424 --> 51:06.619
<i>... and a different environment...</i>

51:06.827 --> 51:09.159
...to select particular
combinations of genes...

51:09.363 --> 51:12.093
...the chance of finding beings
very similar to us...

51:12.299 --> 51:13.766
...must be close to zero.

51:14.334 --> 51:16.393
But the chance of finding another
form of intelligence...

51:16.603 --> 51:17.695
...isn't close to zero.

51:17.904 --> 51:22.034
Their brains may well have evolved
from the inside out as ours have.

51:22.242 --> 51:26.042
They may well have switching elements
analogous to our neurons...

51:26.246 --> 51:28.441
...but their neurons might
be different.

51:28.648 --> 51:32.311
Maybe they're superconductors which
work at very low temperatures...

51:32.519 --> 51:35.317
...in which case,
their speed of thought...

51:35.522 --> 51:38.423
...might be 10 million times
faster than ours.

51:39.159 --> 51:42.060
Or perhaps their neurons are not in...

51:42.262 --> 51:45.129
...direct physical contact
with each other...

51:45.332 --> 51:47.664
...but in radio communication.

51:47.868 --> 51:49.631
So a single intelligent being...

51:49.836 --> 51:53.203
...could be distributed
among many different organisms.

51:53.407 --> 51:56.399
There may be planets in which
intelligent beings have...

51:56.610 --> 52:00.774
...not 10 to the 11 th neurons each,
as we do...

52:00.981 --> 52:04.246
...but 10 to the 20th
or 10 to the 30th.

52:04.951 --> 52:08.284
I wonder what they would know.

52:08.488 --> 52:10.115
If we could make contact...

52:10.323 --> 52:11.415
...there would be...

52:11.625 --> 52:15.823
...much in their brains that would be
of enormous interest to ours.

52:16.563 --> 52:18.053
<i>And vice versa.</i>

52:18.265 --> 52:20.165
<i>I think extraterrestrial</i>
<i>intelligence...</i>

52:20.367 --> 52:23.165
<i>... even beings astonishingly</i>
<i>more evolved than we...</i>

52:23.370 --> 52:26.862
<i>... will be curious about us,</i>
<i>about what we know, how we think...</i>

52:27.073 --> 52:31.169
<i>... the course of our evolution,</i>
<i>the prospects for our future.</i>

52:32.245 --> 52:35.544
<i>Within every human brain,</i>
<i>patterns of electrochemical impulses...</i>

52:35.749 --> 52:38.513
<i>... are continuously forming</i>
<i>and dissipating.</i>

52:38.718 --> 52:41.915
<i>They reflect our emotions,</i>
<i>ideas and memories.</i>

52:42.122 --> 52:44.283
<i>When recorded and amplified...</i>

52:44.491 --> 52:47.255
<i>... these impulses sound like this.</i>

52:47.461 --> 52:49.986
(RUMBLING)

52:50.197 --> 52:52.995
<i>But would an extraterrestrial being,</i>
<i>no matter how advanced...</i>

52:53.200 --> 52:56.226
<i>... be able to read the mind</i>
<i>that made these sounds?</i>

52:56.436 --> 52:59.462
<i>We ourselves are far</i>
<i>from being able to do so.</i>

53:00.207 --> 53:03.665
<i>But in fact, we have sent</i>
<i>the very impulses you are hearing...</i>

53:03.877 --> 53:07.870
<i>... reflecting the emotions, ideas</i>
<i>and memories of one human being...</i>

53:08.081 --> 53:11.744
<i>... on a voyage to the stars.</i>

53:19.025 --> 53:22.153
<i>In August and September 1977...</i>

53:22.362 --> 53:25.195
<i>... two</i> Voyager <i>spacecraft</i>
<i>were launched...</i>

53:25.398 --> 53:29.858
<i>... on an epic journey to</i>
<i>the outer solar system and beyond.</i>

53:30.403 --> 53:34.430
<i>Their scientific mission was</i>
<i>to explore the giant planets...</i>

53:34.774 --> 53:36.605
<i>... first Jupiter</i>
<i>and its satellites...</i>

53:36.810 --> 53:39.904
<i>... and then Saturn</i>
<i>and its system of moons.</i>

53:47.954 --> 53:50.514
<i>Close encounters with</i>
<i>these great worlds...</i>

53:50.724 --> 53:54.751
<i>... accelerate the</i> Voyager <i>spacecraft</i>
<i>out of the solar system.</i>

53:57.030 --> 53:59.794
<i>As an incidental consequence</i>
<i>of their trajectories...</i>

54:00.000 --> 54:03.492
<i>... they will be carried inexorably</i>
<i>into the realm of the stars...</i>

54:03.703 --> 54:05.933
<i>... where they will wander forever.</i>

54:07.841 --> 54:10.833
<i>The ships will be slightly eroded</i>
<i>within the solar system...</i>

54:11.044 --> 54:13.877
<i>... by micrometeorites,</i>
<i>planetary rings systems...</i>

54:14.080 --> 54:16.139
<i>... and radiation belts.</i>

54:20.086 --> 54:21.553
<i>But once past the planets...</i>

54:21.755 --> 54:24.383
<i>... they will endure</i>
<i>for a billion years...</i>

54:24.591 --> 54:27.992
<i>... in the cold vacuum</i>
<i>of interstellar space.</i>

54:29.029 --> 54:30.724
<i>Perhaps in the distant future...</i>

54:30.931 --> 54:34.560
<i>... beings of an alien civilization</i>
<i>will intercept these ships.</i>

54:34.768 --> 54:36.360
<i>They'll examine our spacecraft...</i>

54:36.570 --> 54:39.937
<i>... and understand much about</i>
<i>our science and technology.</i>

54:41.074 --> 54:45.101
<i>But a machine alone can tell</i>
<i>only so much about its makers.</i>

54:45.312 --> 54:48.110
<i>So each bears a golden</i>
<i>phonograph record...</i>

54:48.315 --> 54:51.250
<i>... with not only the brain waves</i>
<i>of a woman from Earth...</i>

54:51.451 --> 54:56.047
<i>... but also an anthology of music,</i>
<i>pictures and sounds of our planet...</i>

54:56.256 --> 54:59.453
<i>... including greetings</i>
<i>in 60 human languages...</i>

54:59.659 --> 55:02.924
<i>... and the salutations</i>
<i>of the humpback whales.</i>

55:03.129 --> 55:06.394
<i>The record cover bears instructions</i>
<i>on how to hear the sounds...</i>

55:06.600 --> 55:08.795
<i>... and see the pictures</i>
<i>encoded on the disk.</i>

55:09.002 --> 55:12.938
<i>Including some snapshots</i>
<i>from the family album...</i>

55:13.139 --> 55:15.232
<i>... of a distant world.</i>

55:44.070 --> 55:46.903
<i>The</i> Voyager <i>record is</i>
<i>a message in a bottle...</i>

55:47.107 --> 55:49.735
<i>... cast into the cosmic ocean.</i>

55:49.943 --> 55:52.912
<i>It contains some of our thoughts</i>
<i>and our feelings...</i>

55:53.113 --> 55:55.240
<i>... something of the information</i>
<i>we store...</i>

55:55.448 --> 55:58.884
<i>... in genes and brains and books.</i>

56:00.320 --> 56:02.379
<i>The recipients, if any...</i>

56:02.589 --> 56:06.525
<i>... will understand the pictures</i>
<i>and sounds incompletely at best.</i>

56:06.726 --> 56:08.990
<i>But one thing would</i>
<i>be clear about us:</i>

56:09.195 --> 56:11.993
<i>No one sends such a message</i>
<i>on such a journey...</i>

56:12.198 --> 56:15.361
<i>... without a positive passion</i>
<i>for the future.</i>

56:15.568 --> 56:18.036
<i>For all the possible vagaries</i>
<i>of the message...</i>

56:18.238 --> 56:21.401
<i>... they will be sure that</i>
<i>we were a species endowed...</i>

56:21.608 --> 56:25.977
<i>... with hope and perseverance,</i>
<i>at least a little intelligence...</i>

56:26.179 --> 56:30.445
<i>... and a longing to make</i>
<i>contact with the cosmos.</i>
