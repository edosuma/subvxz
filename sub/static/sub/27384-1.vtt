[cheering]

00:24.334 --> 00:26.612
[thudding]

00:27.786 --> 00:30.030
- [Tommy] I know
you have it in you.

00:30.064 --> 00:31.031
Bring it out.

00:32.929 --> 00:33.895
Bring it out.

00:36.001 --> 00:37.037
Bring it out.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.488
[tense music]

00:42.973 --> 00:45.424
- [Danny] You've got the item?

00:52.983 --> 00:54.088
- As promised.

00:56.125 --> 00:59.542
You'll never be
able to [mumbling].

00:59.576 --> 01:00.819
[mellow music]

01:00.853 --> 01:02.683
â™ª Ooh

01:47.072 --> 01:50.179
- [Tommy] It wasn't that long
ago when it all went down.

01:50.213 --> 01:52.905
Sure, the bullets, the
blood and the bodies

01:52.940 --> 01:55.425
have all been cleaned
up by now, but,

01:55.460 --> 01:59.291
psychologically, the damage
had already been done.

01:59.326 --> 02:01.155
That's where I come in.

02:01.190 --> 02:02.708
It all started
with Jackson Bolt.

02:02.743 --> 02:06.367
I did my best to clean up
that brother's head, but...

02:06.402 --> 02:08.610
God, I tried, I really did.

02:09.957 --> 02:12.511
[mellow music]

02:15.687 --> 02:16.515
- Jackson.

02:17.758 --> 02:18.655
What?

02:18.690 --> 02:19.622
Jackson.

02:24.213 --> 02:25.628
- You're not listening to me.

02:26.732 --> 02:27.664
- Wait.

02:27.699 --> 02:28.838
Jackson.

02:28.872 --> 02:31.047
Jackson, listen to me.

02:31.081 --> 02:32.669
- [Jackson] 'Cause
he's always over there.

02:32.704 --> 02:33.636
- This is what
I'm talking about.

02:33.670 --> 02:35.431
You never listen.

02:35.465 --> 02:37.122
- Darla, we do this every time.

02:38.468 --> 02:39.262
Hold on a minute.

02:39.297 --> 02:40.125
- Where are you?

02:41.230 --> 02:42.369
- [Gunman] Don't
come any closer, man.

02:42.403 --> 02:43.715
I don't wanna fucking shoot you.

02:43.749 --> 02:44.681
- [Jackson] You're
not gonna shoot me.

02:44.716 --> 02:45.958
Your safety's on.

02:47.615 --> 02:52.068
[thudding]
[grunting]

03:03.942 --> 03:05.081
You know something?

03:05.115 --> 03:06.116
[gunshot blasting]
[screaming]

03:06.151 --> 03:08.084
- Is that gunfire I can hear?

03:08.118 --> 03:10.017
- [Jackson] He better
not be wearing my robe.

03:11.156 --> 03:11.950
- You know, you know what?

03:11.984 --> 03:13.158
Forget it.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.642
- [Jackson] I don't
have time for this shit.

03:16.713 --> 03:17.680
- Kinda like this.

03:20.614 --> 03:23.582
[gunshots blasting]

03:29.105 --> 03:31.349
[crashing]

03:36.043 --> 03:39.046

04:21.329 --> 04:26.300
[gunshot blasting]
[thudding]

04:30.856 --> 04:32.582
- Can't believe
you killed 'em all.

04:35.344 --> 04:36.172
- Pow.

04:44.698 --> 04:45.906
- This is it, right?

04:45.940 --> 04:46.769
- Yep.

04:49.668 --> 04:50.497
- Everything?

04:51.670 --> 04:52.568
[sighing heavily]

04:52.602 --> 04:53.431
- Yeah.

04:55.881 --> 04:56.710
- Get out.

04:57.918 --> 04:59.402
- [Jackson] Seems like
I was in Tommy's office

04:59.437 --> 05:02.336
every other week, right
after another blood bath.

05:02.371 --> 05:04.027
But I didn't care.

05:04.062 --> 05:06.547
We kept him busy and it
kept the streets clean.

05:12.657 --> 05:15.487
Let's take a minute to meet
a couple of shall we say,

05:15.522 --> 05:17.386
service providers.

05:17.420 --> 05:21.010
They go by the name of Sky
Malone and Diamond Doll.

05:21.044 --> 05:22.080
They were always
trying to get away

05:22.114 --> 05:25.221
from their lowlife pimp, Jimmy.

05:25.255 --> 05:27.396
[weeping]

05:31.227 --> 05:32.504
- [Diamond] What happened?

05:33.885 --> 05:37.475
- I almost threw myself
in front of a bus, but

05:37.509 --> 05:39.580
I keep seeing Naomi's face.

05:41.168 --> 05:42.859
- Listen to me.

05:42.894 --> 05:44.827
We're gonna get through this.

05:44.861 --> 05:45.897
I have a plan.

05:47.105 --> 05:49.107
I've been hiding money
in the trunk of my car,

05:49.141 --> 05:50.453
under the spare tire.

05:52.386 --> 05:54.181
Got exactly 2,500.

05:56.010 --> 05:57.702
All I need is 15.

05:57.736 --> 06:00.256
[tense music]

06:02.707 --> 06:04.329
[mumbling]

06:04.364 --> 06:07.539
Found a guy, I'm gonna
pay him to kill Jimmy

06:08.713 --> 06:11.025
and we can leave this shithole.

06:11.060 --> 06:13.131
- Yeah, we'll we're
gonna get caught.

06:13.165 --> 06:15.754
- That's why I want you
to follow behind me.

06:15.789 --> 06:17.515
You make sure no
one's at my back.

06:21.553 --> 06:23.141
It's gonna be okay.

06:24.832 --> 06:25.661
- Okay.

06:27.041 --> 06:29.354
[melancholy music]

06:29.389 --> 06:31.908
You're gonna see Naomi again.

06:31.943 --> 06:33.151
- Okay.

06:33.185 --> 06:34.290
- You're gonna see
your baby again.

06:35.705 --> 06:38.639
[weeping]

06:38.674 --> 06:41.849
[mellow clanky music]

06:52.170 --> 06:54.655
- [Jackson] I really
did my job well,

06:54.690 --> 06:57.520
but damn, my home
life was a wreck.

06:58.556 --> 07:00.143
- I want us to work.

07:04.320 --> 07:06.426
Work, that's the problem.

07:09.083 --> 07:11.189
Oh God, Jackson, I do miss you.

07:13.640 --> 07:16.297
[phone ringing]

07:21.475 --> 07:22.303
- Darla.

07:25.824 --> 07:27.032
- I was just thinking about you.

07:27.067 --> 07:28.620
- I hope that's a good thing.

07:28.655 --> 07:29.552
- I think I can--

07:29.587 --> 07:31.036
- I've been thinking Darla.

07:31.071 --> 07:33.522
I'm not gonna take every case
that comes down the pike.

07:35.938 --> 07:37.042
How's your mom?

07:37.077 --> 07:38.630
[staticky chattering]

07:38.665 --> 07:41.081
- She's not happy I'm here
back in London, though.

07:41.115 --> 07:41.944
- Yeah.

07:42.945 --> 07:44.636
- I want us to work, Jackson.

07:44.671 --> 07:45.844
I really do.

07:48.329 --> 07:50.090
- I promise I won't
blow it this time.

07:51.194 --> 07:52.782
Just come home.

07:52.817 --> 07:55.198
- [Darla] I'll be home soon.

07:55.233 --> 07:57.718
[tense music]

08:16.150 --> 08:18.877
[mystical music]

08:26.264 --> 08:28.646
[whimpering]

09:21.422 --> 09:22.562
[chattering]

09:22.596 --> 09:24.046
- [Man] I didn't
take your skateboard.

09:24.080 --> 09:25.254
- [Man] I know you took it.

09:25.288 --> 09:26.324
- I don't even have
your skateboard.

09:26.358 --> 09:28.222
- I know, you liar.

09:28.257 --> 09:29.914
- [Man] I didn't
take your skateboard.

09:29.948 --> 09:30.846
[thudding]
[groaning]

09:30.880 --> 09:32.675
- [Officer] Follow me.

09:35.747 --> 09:37.438
- Hey Sarge, got her again.

09:37.473 --> 09:39.061
Maybe she shouldn't wear red.

09:39.095 --> 09:40.407
- I like it.

09:40.441 --> 09:41.753
- Wanna book her?

09:41.788 --> 09:42.720
- Yeah.

09:42.754 --> 09:45.170
[mumbling]

09:45.205 --> 09:46.344
- Can you help me find my dog?

09:46.378 --> 09:48.001
His name is Jovar.

09:48.035 --> 09:49.140
He's this small.

09:49.174 --> 09:52.005
[chattering]

09:52.039 --> 09:54.663
- Sergeant, I need your
attention on this right away.

09:56.009 --> 09:57.286
And help her find her dog.

10:01.462 --> 10:04.189
[mystical music]

10:17.478 --> 10:19.722
- [Jackson] Me, trying
to be a super cop,

10:19.757 --> 10:23.105
I totally ignored the one
person I loved the most.

10:23.139 --> 10:23.968
Darla.

10:25.072 --> 10:26.177
Damn, I miss her.

10:26.211 --> 10:28.869
[phone buzzing]

10:32.528 --> 10:33.736
- [Answering Machine
Woman] Sorry, no one

10:33.771 --> 10:35.151
is available to
accept your call.

10:35.186 --> 10:37.188
Please leave a message
after the tone.

10:37.222 --> 10:38.396
[beeping]

10:38.430 --> 10:40.018
- Hi Darla.

10:40.053 --> 10:42.642
[mellow music]

10:44.885 --> 10:47.198
I don't know how we got here.

10:47.232 --> 10:48.648
All I know is that I miss you.

10:50.995 --> 10:52.341
I hope you get this message.

10:55.137 --> 10:55.931
I love you.

11:05.803 --> 11:08.495
[uptempo music]

11:38.663 --> 11:39.940
This is Jimmy.

11:39.975 --> 11:42.494
He's the lowlife scum
of a human being pimp.

11:42.529 --> 11:44.289
He's the poster
boy for depravity.

11:44.324 --> 11:46.153
- Are all the little
fillies in my stable

11:46.188 --> 11:47.983
in a bad mood today?

11:48.017 --> 11:50.192
- How many more months
do I have to pay interest

11:50.226 --> 11:55.162
with my ass, literally,
to Bobby fucking No Nose?

11:56.405 --> 11:57.958
- 'Til Christmas.

11:57.993 --> 12:00.823
- I don't think I can
make it past Halloween.

12:00.858 --> 12:02.756
- Next time you
won't be so eager

12:02.791 --> 12:04.309
to borrow money from the mob.

12:05.414 --> 12:07.140
Payback's a bitch, isn't it?

12:08.003 --> 12:10.212
[sniffing]

12:14.181 --> 12:17.184
- Once I pay off
Bobby and pay you off,

12:17.219 --> 12:18.910
I need a little vacation.

12:20.809 --> 12:22.017
- Where are we gonna go?

12:22.051 --> 12:26.642
- No, I said I need
a little vacation.

12:26.676 --> 12:27.505
- Oh yeah?

12:28.471 --> 12:29.852
That reminds me.

12:29.887 --> 12:31.129
Bobby called.

12:31.164 --> 12:33.925
He needs his next
party this Sunday,

12:33.960 --> 12:35.685
right after nine o'clock mass.

12:40.173 --> 12:44.073
- Do you have any
compassion for anyone?

12:44.108 --> 12:45.178
- Yeah, for me.

12:45.212 --> 12:46.351
[slapping]

12:46.386 --> 12:48.664
[groaning]

12:57.190 --> 13:01.125
- [Jackson] Yeah, Jimmy had
a real way with the ladies.

13:03.886 --> 13:06.544
[heart beating]

13:15.035 --> 13:16.209
- Where the hell's Bolt?

13:18.867 --> 13:19.868
Get your ass in here.

13:23.009 --> 13:24.182
- [Jackson] And it
seems like I was in

13:24.217 --> 13:26.667
the chief's office
every other week, too.

13:26.702 --> 13:28.290
- Sit down.

13:28.324 --> 13:29.325
- [Jackson] I might
as well have my name

13:29.360 --> 13:30.395
on the office door.

13:34.330 --> 13:35.504
- You know what this is?

13:35.538 --> 13:36.643
Tommy's report on you.

13:37.575 --> 13:38.403
It's bullshit.

13:40.095 --> 13:42.511
On top of that, I've
got the D.A. on my--

13:42.545 --> 13:44.133
- Chief Stone.

13:44.168 --> 13:48.344
Oh, just the man I
wanna see behind bars.

13:48.379 --> 13:49.725
And you're gonna make it happen,

13:49.759 --> 13:52.555
so help me or it's
your ass, too.

13:52.590 --> 13:54.040
Jackson, you have
screwed this division

13:54.074 --> 13:55.593
for the last time.

13:55.627 --> 13:56.490
You're going down.

14:01.357 --> 14:03.394
- I can't keep
putting up with this.

14:03.428 --> 14:05.396
I can't keep covering
for your ass.

14:07.053 --> 14:07.847
Are you drinking?

14:11.471 --> 14:13.542
Get your personal shit
together, will you?

14:16.200 --> 14:17.132
Get West in here.

14:28.350 --> 14:30.628
[mumbling]

14:33.389 --> 14:36.047
This is a buddy of yours.

14:36.082 --> 14:37.255
You gotta check him out.

14:38.463 --> 14:40.362
And you two, get your
shit together, too.

14:46.299 --> 14:47.127
Well?

14:48.094 --> 14:48.922
Go.

15:06.940 --> 15:09.080
[tapping]

15:11.496 --> 15:13.119
- Bobbo, hey.

15:13.153 --> 15:15.569
Yeah, yeah, we got
it set up for Sunday.

15:15.604 --> 15:17.537
Yeah, I wanna get you two,

15:17.571 --> 15:19.056
no, okay, okay one's enough.

15:19.090 --> 15:20.091
Yeah, you're gonna like her.

15:20.126 --> 15:22.162
Okay, have a great day and oh,

15:22.197 --> 15:24.164
got another call
coming in thanks.

15:24.199 --> 15:25.372
Vince.

15:25.407 --> 15:26.580
Hey, I'm glad you called.

15:26.615 --> 15:28.134
Yes, I was gonna tell
you the good news.

15:28.168 --> 15:30.930
Everything is going really well

15:30.964 --> 15:33.829
and I'm gonna get those
files from you Tuesday

15:35.106 --> 15:36.659
and I think the new office

15:36.694 --> 15:39.835
is gonna be open by wuh,
excuse me just a sec.

15:41.492 --> 15:42.700
Excuse me?

15:42.734 --> 15:45.151
You're coming out here
looking like this?

15:45.185 --> 15:46.566
Go fucking change.

15:47.532 --> 15:48.948
Go.

15:51.536 --> 15:54.022
Anyway, what I was saying
is, I think that things

15:54.056 --> 15:56.576
are gonna be pretty cool because

15:56.610 --> 16:02.375
once we get these girls out
and get new business going,

16:02.409 --> 16:04.756
I think I'm gonna be happier.

16:04.791 --> 16:06.448
You wouldn't believe
what I go through.

16:06.482 --> 16:11.349
My God, it's, all the
meditation, all the drugs,

16:11.384 --> 16:14.042
all the praying in the
world hasn't helped.

16:14.076 --> 16:16.976
These girls just don't
really know their job.

16:18.425 --> 16:20.876
Look, I'm gonna have
to call you back.

16:25.191 --> 16:26.882
- I got raped tonight.

16:30.403 --> 16:32.336
- You're a dirty little whore.

16:32.370 --> 16:36.064
That's kinda like saying a
boxer got beat up or something.

16:36.098 --> 16:37.824
Who cares?

16:38.998 --> 16:39.999
God.

16:40.033 --> 16:41.310
- I can't keep doing this.

16:43.450 --> 16:46.419
I wanna see my mom and my baby.

16:48.490 --> 16:50.906
- And you will, I
promise, very soon.

16:52.804 --> 16:54.599
- I wanna hold my baby.

16:55.566 --> 16:56.394
- I know.

16:57.878 --> 17:01.089
And you keep saying this but
[mumbling] focus on business.

17:01.123 --> 17:02.331
Okay?

17:02.366 --> 17:03.608
I've got some things
coming down the pike.

17:03.643 --> 17:04.678
I can't really tell
you about everything

17:04.713 --> 17:06.577
but everything's gonna change

17:06.611 --> 17:10.063
and you're gonna be a
free woman very, very soon

17:10.098 --> 17:12.065
but you gotta keep
your little mouth shut

17:12.099 --> 17:14.516
unless I tell you to open
it for certain things,

17:14.550 --> 17:16.104
if you know what I mean, okay?

17:17.346 --> 17:19.659
[sniffling]

17:20.625 --> 17:22.903
- I was raped tonight!

17:22.938 --> 17:25.113
- God sakes, woman.

17:25.146 --> 17:27.391
I'm trying to run
a business here.

17:32.361 --> 17:34.536
[sobbing]

17:58.629 --> 18:01.735
[funky uptempo music]

18:16.854 --> 18:18.787
- Get your ass back in the car.

18:18.821 --> 18:19.684
- Who the fuck you
think you're talking to?

18:19.719 --> 18:20.789
- I'm talking to you, man.

18:20.823 --> 18:23.274
Get your ass back in the car.

18:23.309 --> 18:25.794
[tense music]

18:26.726 --> 18:27.761
- Hey, hey.

18:27.796 --> 18:29.453
What's going on here?

18:29.487 --> 18:32.007
[tense music]

18:33.422 --> 18:34.389
- [Jackson] Toy cop.

18:36.356 --> 18:37.840
- You guys accepting
applications?

18:37.875 --> 18:39.394
- [Jackson] The tip came in
that my old fight promoter

18:39.428 --> 18:41.189
was doing something illegal.

18:41.223 --> 18:42.949
- [Receptionist]
Hi, can I help you?

18:42.983 --> 18:44.192
- [Jackson] I'm
here to see Danny.

18:44.226 --> 18:45.434
- [Receptionist] Do you
have an appointment?

18:46.849 --> 18:48.541
- [Jackson] So, I
do what I do best.

18:49.576 --> 18:52.096
[tense music]

19:01.485 --> 19:02.865
- [Danny] I got the delivery.

19:07.249 --> 19:08.837
- Danny, Danny, Danny.

19:10.045 --> 19:10.977
- [Danny] Just because
you killed somebody

19:11.011 --> 19:13.462
in the ring, you pussy out.

19:14.981 --> 19:18.087
And you cost me millions.

19:18.122 --> 19:19.779
- You know why I'm here.

19:19.813 --> 19:21.332
What is it this time?

19:21.367 --> 19:25.440
Gambling, prostitution, hmm?

19:25.474 --> 19:28.719
- [Danny] No, I play chess.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.485
[tense music]

19:38.453 --> 19:42.940
[thudding]
[grunting]

20:17.112 --> 20:18.493
- [Man] Stop, ha!

20:22.255 --> 20:24.740
[tense music]

20:34.750 --> 20:35.544
- Yeah?

20:38.927 --> 20:40.342
You guys are coming up short.

20:43.552 --> 20:45.451
Need to get your
asses over to 42.

20:46.762 --> 20:47.660
Like now.

20:51.905 --> 20:52.734
Now.

21:03.192 --> 21:04.435
Hey, wake up.

21:04.470 --> 21:06.368
[groaning]

21:06.403 --> 21:08.646
[mumbling]

21:13.410 --> 21:15.032
- See ya tonight after business.

21:15.066 --> 21:17.483
[chattering]

21:22.211 --> 21:23.937
- Little light on the weight.

21:23.972 --> 21:25.249
- [Man] Here you go pops.

21:26.112 --> 21:27.631
Bye.

21:27.665 --> 21:28.632
- [Man In Red Hat] Can you
do a fucking lightweight?

21:28.666 --> 21:29.460
Come on, man.

21:29.495 --> 21:30.392
- Don't worry about it.

21:30.427 --> 21:31.324
It's not your fucking problem.

21:31.359 --> 21:32.498
- Took you so fucking long?

21:32.532 --> 21:34.189
- I was only up
there for 10 minutes.

21:34.223 --> 21:35.017
- You was up there
for 20 minutes--

21:35.052 --> 21:36.156
- Whatever, man.

21:38.573 --> 21:39.367
- [West] What the
fuck happened--

21:39.401 --> 21:40.229
- Man, get outta here.

21:43.336 --> 21:44.510
- How's Darla?

21:44.544 --> 21:45.476
- That's it.

21:46.546 --> 21:47.409
Get outta the car.

21:47.444 --> 21:48.237
- [West] What?

21:54.002 --> 21:55.762
- I'm so tired of
your shit, man.

21:55.797 --> 21:57.074
Tired of your shit.

21:57.108 --> 21:57.902
- What you pushing
on me for, man?

21:57.937 --> 21:59.663
[thudding]

21:59.697 --> 22:00.871
The fuck, Bolt?

22:03.114 --> 22:04.702
We're partners man!

22:05.738 --> 22:06.842
You can't do this.

22:06.877 --> 22:08.361
- [Jackson] He was lucky.

22:08.396 --> 22:12.123
I felt like shit, but a call
came in about a drug deal

22:12.158 --> 22:14.540
going down in one of
Danny's apartments.

22:14.574 --> 22:17.059
[tense music]

22:17.094 --> 22:20.200
[uptempo beat music]

22:40.220 --> 22:43.707
[thudding]
[grunting]

22:43.741 --> 22:45.087
- Fuckin' bitch.

22:45.122 --> 22:48.746
[thudding]
[grunting]

22:48.781 --> 22:51.024
[crashing]

22:54.165 --> 22:55.546
Mother fuck.

22:55.581 --> 22:56.375
- What's up?

22:58.653 --> 23:01.552
[gunshots blasting]

23:03.209 --> 23:06.661
[uptempo music]

23:06.695 --> 23:07.489
- Efficient.

23:12.494 --> 23:13.737
[gunshot blasting]

23:13.771 --> 23:16.084
- Fuck.

23:16.118 --> 23:17.499
Punk mother fucker.

23:17.534 --> 23:22.021
[thudding]
[grunting]

23:24.299 --> 23:26.784
[cracking]
[yelling]

23:26.819 --> 23:28.683
Son of fucking bitch.

23:29.718 --> 23:30.926
[cracking]

23:30.961 --> 23:32.445
- Oh my God, what the
hell's going on in here?

23:35.897 --> 23:37.795
[gunshots blasting]

23:37.830 --> 23:40.488
[uptempo music]

23:43.352 --> 23:46.045
- Before you go out, be
sure [mumbling] mess.

23:48.012 --> 23:48.944
- [West] Screw yourself.

23:56.158 --> 23:58.540
- West, freeze.

23:58.575 --> 24:00.749
But then I realized I couldn't
pull the trigger on my gun.

24:00.784 --> 24:01.819
- Matter?

24:01.854 --> 24:02.993
Can't pull the trigger?

24:03.027 --> 24:04.132
Let me help you.

24:04.166 --> 24:06.272
[gunshot blasting]

24:06.306 --> 24:08.792
[tense music]

24:10.276 --> 24:13.590
[melancholy rock music]

24:15.592 --> 24:18.008
Managed to slip through the
hands of some rookie cops.

24:18.042 --> 24:20.597
[mumbling]

24:20.631 --> 24:23.945
[melancholy rock music]

24:36.578 --> 24:40.617
Diamond's 11:30 john found
her dead and called 9-1-1.

24:42.688 --> 24:46.001
[melancholy rock music]

25:11.786 --> 25:14.202
While Jimmy rejoiced over
the paramedic's inability

25:14.236 --> 25:16.411
to resuscitate
Diamond, Sky was busy

25:16.445 --> 25:17.619
doing what she needed to do

25:17.654 --> 25:19.828
to make a downpayment
on Jimmy's demise.

25:31.426 --> 25:35.361
Jimmy cried like he cared,
but it was all just an act.

25:35.395 --> 25:37.259
Jimmy had a real
way with the ladies.

25:42.886 --> 25:45.716
- Yeah, I know, I
know, he's a problem,

25:45.751 --> 25:47.753
but it's our problem, not yours.

25:47.787 --> 25:49.064
Look, just do your job.

25:49.099 --> 25:50.031
We'll do ours.

25:57.038 --> 25:58.349
- You wanted to see me, Chief?

25:58.384 --> 25:59.212
- Yeah.

26:00.420 --> 26:03.078
I had you transferred
here for a reason.

26:03.113 --> 26:06.150
Your buddy's in trouble
and you're gonna watch him.

26:08.118 --> 26:09.671
And you can start with his wife.

26:10.810 --> 26:12.501
But not like West.

26:15.953 --> 26:18.162
- [Darla] David, is
this really necessary?

26:20.371 --> 26:24.134
- Darla, you and I both know
Jackson didn't kill anybody.

26:25.411 --> 26:26.274
His partner.

26:27.551 --> 26:28.828
I've got one word for you.

26:30.554 --> 26:32.142
Framed.

26:32.176 --> 26:34.972
- Look, I can assure
you he is not here.

26:35.007 --> 26:38.113
If you want to protect me, you
can do it from outside, okay?

26:39.598 --> 26:41.910
Now, I'm gonna go
upstairs to rest

26:41.945 --> 26:45.155
and when I wake up, I
want you out of my house.

26:49.366 --> 26:50.643
- I know he's here, Darla.

27:00.446 --> 27:03.035
[door slamming]

27:11.802 --> 27:12.596
- Hey.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.253
- Good job, baby.

27:14.287 --> 27:16.427
- He's gone, I think we're safe.

27:16.462 --> 27:18.291
- He's the only one I trust.

27:18.326 --> 27:19.568
- I know.

27:19.603 --> 27:20.431
- Hey.

27:23.400 --> 27:26.541
I need you to give him
this cell phone, okay?

27:26.575 --> 27:28.716
Don't let anybody see you do it.

27:28.750 --> 27:29.578
- Okay.

27:30.752 --> 27:32.651
- I'm gonna follow
up on a few things,

27:34.169 --> 27:39.727
kill some people and call
him in the morning, alright?

27:39.761 --> 27:40.555
- Mmm hmm.

27:40.589 --> 27:41.867
- I gotta go.

27:41.901 --> 27:43.109
- Okay.

27:43.144 --> 27:44.076
- I miss you.

27:44.110 --> 27:45.525
- I miss you, too.

27:49.598 --> 27:51.462
- Remember the time
when we went swimming

27:51.497 --> 27:52.878
and you fell in the pool?

27:52.912 --> 27:54.603
[chuckling]

27:54.638 --> 27:56.675
- Yes, I remember the time.

27:59.125 --> 27:59.954
- Those were good times.

27:59.988 --> 28:02.784
[melancholy music]

28:07.513 --> 28:10.930
- When this is all over,
we need to talk, okay?

28:14.071 --> 28:14.900
- Okay.

28:32.987 --> 28:35.783
[traffic zooming]

28:46.759 --> 28:50.142
According to the news, that
man Bolt was on the run,

28:50.176 --> 28:52.592
but I was actually on the hunt.

28:52.627 --> 28:53.973
- Hey David, I got a
line on that Texas game.

28:54.008 --> 28:54.940
You in?

28:54.974 --> 28:55.734
- Oh yeah, man, I'm down.

28:55.768 --> 28:56.562
- Let's do it.

28:56.596 --> 28:57.494
- Let's do that.

28:57.528 --> 29:00.255
[phone ringing]

29:00.290 --> 29:01.118
Hello?

29:01.153 --> 29:02.257
- David, hey it's J.B.

29:03.603 --> 29:05.053
You got anything on Danny?

29:05.088 --> 29:07.124
- Nah, and do I got
something for you.

29:07.159 --> 29:08.401
- [Man] How about
making that bet partner?

29:08.436 --> 29:10.058
- Ugh, get outta here.

29:11.577 --> 29:13.752
He's got this big old fight
lined up for Saturday night.

29:13.786 --> 29:16.616
Yeah, supposed to be
five guys against one.

29:16.651 --> 29:17.445
- This Saturday?

29:17.479 --> 29:18.342
Like, in a few days?

29:18.377 --> 29:19.205
- Yeah.

29:19.240 --> 29:20.759
- Are there any details?

29:20.793 --> 29:23.382
- The who's who of fighters
and some surprise kickboxer.

29:23.416 --> 29:25.694
Yeah, some sort of mystery man.

29:25.729 --> 29:27.973
- Yeah, I think I know
who the kickboxer is.

29:28.007 --> 29:29.008
- Yeah.

29:29.043 --> 29:29.837
- Is there a website?

29:29.871 --> 29:31.217
- No website, huh uh.

29:31.252 --> 29:32.736
- Look, man.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.911
I got a little problem I
need you to help me with.

29:34.945 --> 29:37.189
- So, that's why
your wife left you.

29:37.223 --> 29:38.190
[chuckling]

29:38.224 --> 29:40.537
- Man, I'm gonna kick your ass.

29:40.571 --> 29:42.125
- Too soon?

29:42.159 --> 29:43.505
- Got this pain in my head.

29:44.886 --> 29:47.095
My God, it's ringing, it hurts.

29:47.130 --> 29:48.648
Can't pull the
trigger on my gun.

29:48.683 --> 29:49.649
- What?

29:49.684 --> 29:51.375
- I need you to research Danny.

29:51.410 --> 29:52.825
I'll catch up with you later.

29:56.518 --> 29:58.313
You can find Danny
in one of two places.

29:58.348 --> 30:00.246
His office or his bar.

30:00.281 --> 30:02.421
I decided to start
with his office.

30:02.455 --> 30:05.320
There was something about that
silver briefcase on his desk.

30:05.355 --> 30:07.219
I just had to know
what was in it.

30:07.253 --> 30:08.082
Hey!

30:09.290 --> 30:13.777
[thudding]
[grunting]

30:25.271 --> 30:26.100
- Freeze!

30:26.134 --> 30:26.997
Don't move.

30:28.033 --> 30:30.345
[chuckling]

30:33.072 --> 30:33.970
Toy cop, huh?

30:35.074 --> 30:37.352
[thudding]

30:39.838 --> 30:40.700
- Toy cop.

30:53.679 --> 30:55.336
Sky had everything planned out.

30:58.201 --> 30:59.512
What she needed to do
was bring the money

30:59.547 --> 31:01.514
to a guy in the suit,
sitting by the window

31:01.549 --> 31:03.689
at the coffee shop
at a certain time.

31:03.723 --> 31:05.346
What could possibly go wrong?

31:08.314 --> 31:12.008
- Looks like we both clean
up pretty well, don't we?

31:12.042 --> 31:15.356
- I was just gonna get coffee.

31:15.390 --> 31:17.392
I was gonna see if you
wanted anything, too.

31:17.427 --> 31:18.946
- I want a lot,

31:18.980 --> 31:21.258
starting with your pretty
little ass in this chair.

31:27.333 --> 31:30.716
You know I was up all
night tossing and turning,

31:30.750 --> 31:34.927
agonizing over what to tell
you about my new business.

31:34.962 --> 31:36.584
- What new business?

31:37.654 --> 31:41.796
- My brother is a hired killer.

31:46.974 --> 31:49.183
[slurping]

31:51.633 --> 31:54.188
He's been teaching
me everything.

31:54.222 --> 31:55.914
Pretty cool, huh?

31:55.948 --> 31:58.226
- [Waitress] Can I get
you something to drink?

31:58.261 --> 32:00.090
You're good for now?

32:00.125 --> 32:01.609
- I'm doing fine, thank you.

32:04.612 --> 32:08.719
I did my first practice kill
last night and I love it.

32:08.754 --> 32:11.067
It's even better
than peddling flesh.

32:12.413 --> 32:15.105
The other thing that I
haven't been telling you

32:15.140 --> 32:17.521
is that every day I have
to make a phone call

32:17.556 --> 32:20.869
to my brother down
in L.A. and every day

32:20.904 --> 32:24.528
I have to remind him not
to kill that nice woman

32:26.082 --> 32:29.982
and not to kill that
little bastard baby.

32:31.742 --> 32:33.537
And I have to tell him

32:34.883 --> 32:39.543
not to go to 4999
Manchester Circle.

32:39.578 --> 32:41.580
[tense music]

32:41.614 --> 32:43.340
Apartment 18.

32:45.480 --> 32:46.861
- You know what, Jimmy?

32:46.895 --> 32:49.726
Someday, you're not
gonna hold all the cards,

32:49.760 --> 32:52.660
and when that day comes,
you're gonna be sorry.

32:55.559 --> 32:59.149
- Here's to that day being
many years in the future.

32:59.184 --> 33:01.151
- I'd spit in your
fuckin' face right now

33:01.186 --> 33:03.222
if I didn't know that
you'd like it so much.

33:03.257 --> 33:05.811
- You paint me to
be such a perv, Sky.

33:05.845 --> 33:07.606
But look at yourself.

33:07.640 --> 33:10.298
- I'm paying for my sins, okay?

33:10.333 --> 33:12.542
At least I'm trying.

33:12.576 --> 33:13.370
You.

33:14.889 --> 33:18.444
Someone's gonna come along
and have to make you pay.

33:18.479 --> 33:20.136
- I can't wait.

33:21.102 --> 33:24.002
[tense music]

33:24.036 --> 33:26.521
- Ladies and gentlemen,
I am Cecil J. Blondie,

33:26.556 --> 33:27.833
at least I used to be.

33:27.867 --> 33:29.800
So good to see you all
coming out here today

33:29.835 --> 33:32.113
to Sergeant Pepper's,
especially you, Frank.

33:32.148 --> 33:34.150
We've got a great show
for you lined up today

33:34.184 --> 33:36.290
as long as Jennifer remembers
to kick a little higher,

33:36.324 --> 33:37.877
keep her leg in the
air and it shouldn't be

33:37.912 --> 33:40.052
too much of a stretch
for her, we like to hope.

33:40.087 --> 33:41.502
Go ahead and put
your hands together

33:41.536 --> 33:44.194
but keep it in your
pants for the Frat Girls!

33:44.229 --> 33:46.472
[clapping]

33:51.270 --> 33:53.100
[uptempo sexy music]

33:53.134 --> 33:57.380
- Okay, let's start with
the burlesque stab and go.

33:58.864 --> 33:59.658
Slap.

34:01.177 --> 34:03.282
[mumbling]

34:08.873 --> 34:11.359
- Yeah, babies, come on.

34:11.393 --> 34:13.051
[chattering]

34:13.085 --> 34:15.293
- Hey there, hey, hey, hey.

34:15.329 --> 34:16.123
- [Woman] Son of a bitch!

34:16.157 --> 34:16.951
[grunting]

34:16.985 --> 34:18.469
- [Woman] Get out.

34:22.094 --> 34:24.407
[screaming]

34:31.241 --> 34:32.242
- [Jackson] My bout
with depression

34:32.277 --> 34:34.244
was getting worse and worse.

34:34.279 --> 34:36.695
Killing Danny may not
prove my innocence,

34:36.728 --> 34:39.248
but it just might cheer
me up a little bit.

34:39.284 --> 34:40.456
- [Danny] Jackson Bolt.

34:41.355 --> 34:43.529
Hard time as always, my brother.

34:46.601 --> 34:48.603
- Give me one reason
why I shouldn't fuckin'

34:48.638 --> 34:50.571
kill you right now.

34:50.605 --> 34:52.123
- Oh, Jackson.

34:52.159 --> 34:54.713
'Cause I'm the guy with
an eyewitness that knows

34:54.746 --> 34:56.163
you didn't really kill anybody.

34:56.197 --> 34:57.750
- But that would implicate you.

34:57.785 --> 35:01.099
- I never let the truth get
in the way of a good story.

35:01.133 --> 35:02.238
- I'm not following.

35:02.272 --> 35:03.756
- And you never will,

35:03.791 --> 35:05.448
because while you're running
around playing checkers,

35:05.482 --> 35:06.966
I'm playing a
thinking man's game.

35:07.001 --> 35:09.383
A civilized game, chess.

35:09.417 --> 35:12.006
It's more civilized
and highly profitable.

35:12.040 --> 35:15.251
You see, half these cops,
they wanna kill you.

35:15.285 --> 35:18.323
The other half, well,
your partner was no saint.

35:18.357 --> 35:20.290
He was screwing a
bunch of guys' wives.

35:21.395 --> 35:26.331
[thudding]
[grunting]

35:26.365 --> 35:28.574
[tense music]

35:28.609 --> 35:31.267
- [Ruby] Fuck you
and your badge.

35:31.301 --> 35:35.788
[thudding]
[grunting]

37:12.471 --> 37:14.162
[thudding]

37:14.197 --> 37:14.991
- Bitch.

37:15.025 --> 37:17.752
[screaming]

37:17.787 --> 37:19.306
[breathing heavily]

37:19.340 --> 37:21.308
- Hoo hooey, Jackson.

37:21.342 --> 37:23.102
You still got it, boy.

37:23.137 --> 37:27.521
But remember my friend,
king beats pawn every time.

37:28.694 --> 37:29.799
- [Jackson] Pretty sure
that was an audition

37:29.833 --> 37:31.421
for Danny's event in a few days.

37:32.698 --> 37:34.079
What the hell was he up to?

37:43.122 --> 37:46.125
- Hey pumpkin, you look so sad.

37:46.160 --> 37:47.472
What's going on?

37:48.611 --> 37:50.509
You know what today is?

37:50.544 --> 37:53.685
It's take your kid to work day.

37:53.719 --> 37:55.203
But you know what?

37:55.238 --> 37:58.966
Instead of you following
Daddy around all day,

37:59.000 --> 38:02.176
I need you to sit
tight and wait.

38:03.453 --> 38:05.110
Now, give me your hand.

38:05.144 --> 38:06.042
- [Sky] What? No.

38:06.076 --> 38:07.250
- I said give me your hand.

38:20.401 --> 38:22.265
- You're gonna be [mumbling].

38:22.300 --> 38:24.440
[dinging]

39:27.675 --> 39:29.919
[blasting]

39:31.265 --> 39:33.025
- [Sky] What'd you do?

39:33.060 --> 39:35.787
- I'm starting to
get the hang of this.

39:35.821 --> 39:38.065
[blasting]

39:39.722 --> 39:40.516
[uptempo hip-hop music]

â™ª Here's my rebuttal

39:42.069 --> 39:45.417
â™ª It's my time,

â™ª Don't hate the

40:04.056 --> 40:05.955
â™ª Hear a lot of music

40:05.989 --> 40:08.751
â™ª Even in my dreams

40:08.785 --> 40:13.480
â™ª Sweet funky music
with a melody

40:13.514 --> 40:15.309
â™ª Straight from my heart

40:15.343 --> 40:18.243
â™ª I'm here today

- What the hell?

41:06.636 --> 41:09.225
Alright, come on.

41:09.259 --> 41:12.815
Let me see you.

41:12.849 --> 41:14.713
Goddamn, bro.

41:14.748 --> 41:17.026
Don't you know how to
make an appointment, man?

41:17.060 --> 41:18.476
- Two, you're all booked up.

41:20.063 --> 41:20.995
Better check your fridge.

41:21.030 --> 41:22.997
You're almost outta beer.

41:23.032 --> 41:25.483
- What the hell you doin'
in my refrigerator, anyway?

41:25.517 --> 41:26.414
- I got's thirsty.

41:30.695 --> 41:31.592
- Then drink.

41:31.627 --> 41:33.663
- It's like I was sayin' fellas.

41:33.698 --> 41:36.494
You know, I hired you guys
to track somebody down.

41:36.528 --> 41:39.600
Turns out, I know
exactly where he is.

41:39.635 --> 41:40.636
- [Biker] Where's the guy?

41:40.670 --> 41:43.397
- It's Jackson Bolt, cop killer.

41:49.507 --> 41:51.198
- [Biker] We got a job to do.

41:51.232 --> 41:54.339
The address is 357 Gibbs Lane.

41:54.373 --> 41:55.961
We'll see ya there.

41:55.996 --> 41:58.930
[engines grumbling]

42:10.838 --> 42:13.738
- Okay, we've done this before.

42:13.772 --> 42:14.911
Just trying to get
something done.

42:14.946 --> 42:16.464
Sure you can handle
it this time?

42:18.846 --> 42:21.055
Alright, so I'll tell
ya what I'm gonna do.

42:21.090 --> 42:23.230
Just for the record,
I'm gonna record

42:23.264 --> 42:25.335
this conversation, alright?

42:28.407 --> 42:30.099
Okay, so what I
want you to do now

42:30.133 --> 42:31.997
is just try to relax, alright?

42:32.032 --> 42:33.171
Just lay down.

42:34.206 --> 42:36.174
Let your mind wander, see if we

42:36.208 --> 42:37.762
can get something done, alright?

42:44.216 --> 42:49.912
So, try to remember all these
things that happened to you.

42:49.946 --> 42:50.464
Take me back there.

42:50.498 --> 42:51.810
Make me,

42:51.845 --> 42:52.880

have to do this?

43:01.268 --> 43:02.752
- Just relax.

43:02.787 --> 43:04.754
Take a deep breath, alright?

43:04.789 --> 43:05.583
One more time.

Tell me what you see.

Just, if you relax, will come.

43:21.702 --> 43:22.738
Don't fight me.

43:22.772 --> 43:23.601

Tell me what you hear, what
you see, what you smell.

43:58.014 --> 43:58.843
Maybe two.

44:04.469 --> 44:05.263
I'm sorry, Tommy.

44:05.297 --> 44:06.126
I can't do this.

Two guys are hittin' me.

- Man, can I just go get a beer?

44:50.446 --> 44:51.585
- Yeah.

44:51.619 --> 44:52.586
This one you're gonna
have to pay for.

46:52.119 --> 46:53.120
That's easy to say.

46:53.155 --> 46:54.604
You got your gun in your hand.

46:54.639 --> 46:56.123
I got my piece over there.

46:56.158 --> 46:57.538
I mean, it's easy to do.

listen to my idea?

48:28.836 --> 48:29.734
- Oh, I don't know.

48:29.768 --> 48:30.908
I just can't find Jackson.

48:30.942 --> 48:31.943
I can't--

48:31.978 --> 48:33.772
- Shh, shh, shh.

48:33.807 --> 48:34.981
There's only so many
places he could go

48:35.015 --> 48:36.810
to have that thing removed.

48:36.844 --> 48:38.570
I'm already on it.

48:38.605 --> 48:39.537
- There was something in my head

48:39.571 --> 48:41.194
that had to come out.

48:41.228 --> 48:43.955
I just remember waking
up in the hospital.

48:43.990 --> 48:45.025
Did they get it out?

48:46.026 --> 48:47.338
- Seriously, Bolt?

48:47.372 --> 48:48.201
Pizza?

48:49.374 --> 48:51.445
You are on a clear liquid diet.

48:52.584 --> 48:53.516
That's your dinner.

48:58.452 --> 48:59.246
- Hell yeah, they got it.

48:59.281 --> 49:00.489
It's right here, man.

49:00.523 --> 49:01.352
- Oh.

49:02.870 --> 49:04.217
Who knows I'm here?

49:04.251 --> 49:05.804
- Man, I checked you
in with a fake I.D.

49:05.839 --> 49:06.771
Only me and Darla.

49:06.805 --> 49:10.085
- Oh, Darla?

49:10.119 --> 49:11.638
Man, she's gonna want to
have to come up here and--

49:11.672 --> 49:13.122
- No, man, no.

49:13.157 --> 49:14.468
Now, calm down, she's good,
I told her all about it.

49:14.503 --> 49:15.504
Everything's fine.

49:17.575 --> 49:18.956
- What about the blonde?

49:18.990 --> 49:21.372
- Ah, that would
be Bonnie Cardoza.

49:21.406 --> 49:23.063
Yeah, she works at Genotech.

49:23.098 --> 49:25.100
She's friends with
your boy, Danny.

49:25.134 --> 49:26.998
I think he paid off
her gambling debts

49:27.033 --> 49:27.895
and in return,

49:29.173 --> 49:32.072
she got him this
mind control device.

49:33.522 --> 49:35.593
I'm sure they have bigger
plans than just you.

49:35.627 --> 49:36.456
- Wow.

49:37.664 --> 49:39.390
What'd you do with her?

49:39.424 --> 49:41.150
- Oh, you mean like
unnatural acts?

49:41.185 --> 49:43.911
- [Jackson] No, no, asshole.

49:43.946 --> 49:45.534
Where is she?

49:45.568 --> 49:46.328
- She's fine.

49:46.362 --> 49:47.501
She's safe.

49:47.536 --> 49:49.227
We did just that
homework like you asked.

49:49.262 --> 49:50.090
- Good.

49:50.988 --> 49:53.162
Good, did you bring my bag?

49:53.197 --> 49:53.991
- [David] Duh.

49:55.716 --> 49:56.545
It's right here.

49:57.477 --> 49:58.996
- Get me my thing out my bag.

49:59.030 --> 50:00.618
- You get up outta that
bed and I'll give you

50:00.652 --> 50:01.826
that thing in your bag.

50:04.587 --> 50:05.795
- I'm gonna kick your ass, man.

50:05.830 --> 50:07.314
- That's what you keep sayin'.

50:10.283 --> 50:12.492
Look a little
wobbly there, Chief.

50:12.526 --> 50:15.012
[tense music]

50:18.084 --> 50:20.155
I think you're looking
for this, right here.

50:26.471 --> 50:27.300
You ready?

50:28.266 --> 50:31.304
[uptempo beat music]

50:39.588 --> 50:41.693
- I'm looking for someone.

50:42.936 --> 50:43.695
Jackson.

50:44.800 --> 50:45.732
Jackson Bolt.

50:48.631 --> 50:49.667
- Sorry, sir.

50:51.807 --> 50:53.395
[mumbling]

50:53.429 --> 50:54.258
- Wrong answer.

50:54.292 --> 50:57.226
[gunshots blasting]

51:09.721 --> 51:11.206
- Bolt.

51:11.240 --> 51:13.380
[thudding]
[grunting]

51:13.415 --> 51:15.831
- Man, you almost got
us fuckin' killed.

51:16.901 --> 51:18.178
- [Jackson] I like his suit.

51:18.213 --> 51:19.800
- Hey, it will fit you, I think.

51:22.631 --> 51:24.391
- Freeze, get on
the fucking ground!

51:25.668 --> 51:28.568
[gunshot blasting]

51:30.811 --> 51:32.468
[tense music]

51:32.503 --> 51:35.471
[gunshots blasting]

51:52.661 --> 51:53.455
- Bolt!

51:54.456 --> 51:57.286
[gunshot blasting]

51:57.321 --> 52:00.186
[tense beat music]

52:03.465 --> 52:04.707
- I'm good, man, I'm good.

52:04.742 --> 52:06.330
It went straight through.

52:06.364 --> 52:08.055
Take this, get 'em man.

52:08.090 --> 52:09.643
I got your back.

52:09.678 --> 52:12.129
Go get 'em, go get 'em.

52:15.062 --> 52:16.650
- Number One, check in.

52:16.685 --> 52:18.169
- Number One, checking in.

52:18.204 --> 52:19.136
We got cops, sir.

52:20.447 --> 52:21.621
Too many cops.

52:21.655 --> 52:23.070
I think we gotta
get outta here, man.

52:23.105 --> 52:24.727
- I don't pay you to think.

52:24.762 --> 52:26.695
I pay you to do your job.

52:26.729 --> 52:28.869
Now, if you leave this
building without securing

52:28.904 --> 52:32.425
the package, I will hunt you
down and kill you personally.

52:32.459 --> 52:33.633
Do you understand?

52:34.772 --> 52:36.256
- Roger that, sir.

52:36.291 --> 52:39.190
[gunshot blasting]

52:42.124 --> 52:46.577
[thudding]
[grunting]

52:46.611 --> 52:47.405
- I don't have a gun.

52:47.440 --> 52:48.544
[gunshot blasting]

52:48.579 --> 52:49.925
- Number Three.

52:49.959 --> 52:51.892
Do you have the backpack?

52:51.927 --> 52:54.136
- 'Course I got the
fucking backpack.

52:54.171 --> 52:57.035
[tense beat music]

52:58.761 --> 53:03.110
Oh, fuck.

53:05.906 --> 53:07.184
[thudding]
[grunting]

53:07.218 --> 53:09.047
- Mr. Roundtree.

53:09.082 --> 53:10.463
We need another specimen.

53:11.429 --> 53:12.430
- [Mr. Roundtree] I just peed.

53:12.465 --> 53:13.535
- Well, drink some water.

53:13.569 --> 53:14.536
We need it.

53:14.570 --> 53:16.158
Ring the bell when you're done.

53:16.193 --> 53:19.748
[thudding]
[grunting]

53:19.782 --> 53:21.163
- I gotta get outta here.

53:24.304 --> 53:25.685
Time for a mixed drink.

53:36.454 --> 53:38.767
[swooshing]

53:41.425 --> 53:42.288
Ah freedom.

53:46.947 --> 53:51.435
[thudding]
[grunting]

54:00.823 --> 54:03.101
This bitch just got peed on.

54:04.275 --> 54:08.762
[thudding]
[grunting]

54:19.014 --> 54:20.118

[breathing heavily]

55:58.700 --> 56:00.874
[beeping]

56:02.462 --> 56:03.601
- [Surgeon] Okay, ladies,
let's get this liver in.

56:03.636 --> 56:04.775
I've got a date tonight.

56:06.363 --> 56:07.571
- [Nurse] Thank God.

56:07.605 --> 56:08.434
- [Surgeon] There's
always an option.

56:08.468 --> 56:09.538
Hey!

56:09.573 --> 56:10.815
- Shh.

56:10.850 --> 56:11.471
- [Nurse] What are
you doing in here?

56:11.506 --> 56:12.438
- Shh, shh, shh.

56:12.472 --> 56:13.231
- [Surgeon] Excuse me, sir.

56:13.266 --> 56:13.749
Sir, can't you see--

56:13.784 --> 56:14.578
- Shh.

56:14.612 --> 56:16.752
[beeping]

56:20.549 --> 56:21.447
- [Surgeon] Gentlemen.

56:21.481 --> 56:22.586
- Shut up.

56:22.620 --> 56:23.414
- [Surgeon] Gentlemen.

56:23.449 --> 56:24.242
This is an O.R.

56:24.277 --> 56:25.899
- I said shut up!

56:30.283 --> 56:31.664

57:21.990 --> 57:23.647
[groaning]

57:23.681 --> 57:24.510
- Sorry, man.

57:26.512 --> 57:28.479
It's the way it's gotta be.

57:28.514 --> 57:30.654
[beeping]

57:35.313 --> 57:37.281
- [Jackson] In case you
were missing Jimmy and Sky,

57:37.315 --> 57:38.938
here they are, right
on time just to do

57:38.972 --> 57:40.526
a little dirty work for Danny.

57:40.560 --> 57:43.908
- So, what you're saying
is, this is a two-man job?

57:43.943 --> 57:46.014
- Like I said a
hundred times, yes.

57:46.048 --> 57:47.291
Of course it is.

57:47.325 --> 57:49.396
- What I mean is,
I can't fuck up

57:49.431 --> 57:50.743
or you lose your paycheck.

57:53.987 --> 57:58.544
[grunting]
[smooching]

58:00.407 --> 58:02.582
Don't make me fall
in love with you.

58:02.617 --> 58:04.411
- Jimmy, you're not getting me.

58:04.446 --> 58:07.345
- Oh, I'm getting
you alright, Sky,

58:07.380 --> 58:09.589
but what I don't want is for you

58:09.624 --> 58:13.420
to get kinda goofy all of a
sudden and change the plans

58:13.455 --> 58:16.354
because I might
accidentally grab this gun

58:16.389 --> 58:20.566
and spray your gray matter all
over the concrete out there.

58:20.600 --> 58:22.326
Do you want that?

58:22.360 --> 58:26.606
Your 100% commitment
to me is more important

58:26.641 --> 58:27.987
than this little gig here.

58:28.021 --> 58:31.473
Now, let's get out
there and do it.

58:34.200 --> 58:37.099
[doorbell ringing]

58:41.828 --> 58:43.140
Mrs. Bolt?

58:43.174 --> 58:44.624
- Yes.

58:44.659 --> 58:48.179
- Hi, I'm Officer DeSouza,
this is Officer Wright

58:48.214 --> 58:50.112
and we're here to
replace the gentlemen

58:50.147 --> 58:51.666
who have been watching you.

58:51.700 --> 58:53.633
- Oh, what happened to Greg?

58:53.668 --> 58:55.635
- He's dead to the world, tired.

58:55.670 --> 58:57.085
We had to let him go.

58:57.119 --> 58:58.707
- There is one thing
you could do for me.

58:58.742 --> 58:59.674
- [Jimmy] Sure.

58:59.708 --> 59:00.640
- I need to go somewhere.

59:00.675 --> 59:02.055
- You know what?

59:02.090 --> 59:04.679
We have strict instructions
to take you nowhere

59:04.713 --> 59:06.784
unless you had to
go to the hospital.

59:06.819 --> 59:08.993
- Yes, I do.

59:09.028 --> 59:09.787
I need to go to the hospital.

59:09.822 --> 59:10.616
- [Jimmy] Which one?

59:10.650 --> 59:11.686
- Mercy Hospital.

59:11.720 --> 59:12.825
- Let's get crackin'.

59:12.859 --> 59:13.791
Come on.

59:13.826 --> 59:16.207
- Great, I'll just get my bag.

59:20.315 --> 59:21.799
- [Sky] After you.

59:25.907 --> 59:27.874
- Thank you so much for this.

59:34.847 --> 59:36.952
[screaming]

59:36.987 --> 59:38.782
- So sorry about this.

59:39.955 --> 59:41.094
You know what?

59:41.129 --> 59:42.682
Seems much worse than it is, but

59:43.614 --> 59:44.788
now that we're together,

59:45.961 --> 59:50.483
I think you and I
can make things work.

59:50.517 --> 59:51.691
We're both victims here.

59:52.589 --> 59:54.763
- I'm nothing like you.

59:54.798 --> 59:56.834
- Yes, you are.

59:56.869 --> 01:00:01.839
You know, you're a lady,
and I understand that.

01:00:03.116 --> 01:00:06.672
But right now, you're my lady,

01:00:07.949 --> 01:00:10.952
and when we get through
this little ordeal,

01:00:10.986 --> 01:00:15.335
I think maybe we
can both escape.

01:00:15.370 --> 01:00:17.579
- Don't be stupid.

01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:19.512
He'll kill us both
and you know it.

01:00:20.478 --> 01:00:21.272
- You know what?

01:00:21.307 --> 01:00:22.549
I don't think so.

01:00:22.584 --> 01:00:24.586
I'm extremely valuable to him.

01:00:24.621 --> 01:00:25.587
- Pfft.

01:00:25.622 --> 01:00:27.762
- He's got a lot
of plans for me,

01:00:27.796 --> 01:00:28.659
and you know what?

01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:31.282
I've got a few plans for you.

01:00:32.525 --> 01:00:37.012
But, do this right, this
doesn't have to go down

01:00:37.047 --> 01:00:39.808
your throat 'cause I'd
hate to see what would

01:00:39.843 --> 01:00:42.984
happen to those
beautiful [mumbling].

01:00:44.261 --> 01:00:47.747
So, what do you say
we work together?

01:00:47.782 --> 01:00:48.575
Okay?

01:00:48.610 --> 01:00:49.680
- Fuck you.

01:00:49.715 --> 01:00:50.923
- Okay.

01:00:50.957 --> 01:00:51.751
That's a great idea.

01:00:51.786 --> 01:00:54.098
- Don't touch me.

01:00:54.133 --> 01:00:55.962
- Oh, please, dear.

01:00:55.997 --> 01:00:59.690
You don't understand
me at all, do you?

01:00:59.725 --> 01:01:01.071
- Keep away from me.

01:01:03.107 --> 01:01:08.250
- How could I keep away from
something so precious like you?

01:01:08.285 --> 01:01:09.596
Please understand.

01:01:09.631 --> 01:01:10.425
[spitting]

01:01:10.459 --> 01:01:11.288
Oh!

01:01:14.601 --> 01:01:17.259
Oh my, this is
always how it starts.

01:01:19.227 --> 01:01:20.331
I think this is yours.

01:01:22.989 --> 01:01:27.649
[clanking]
[whimpering]

01:01:37.521 --> 01:01:38.833
I think she doesn't like me.

01:01:38.867 --> 01:01:40.800
- Zip it up.

01:01:40.835 --> 01:01:42.837
One day that dick's
gonna get you killed.

01:01:45.391 --> 01:01:46.219
- Idea.

01:01:47.634 --> 01:01:48.497
Threesome.

01:01:51.362 --> 01:01:52.432
- Fuck you.

01:01:52.467 --> 01:01:53.261
Partner.

01:01:54.227 --> 01:01:56.436
[laughing]

01:02:02.511 --> 01:02:04.686
- Your man is an asshole.

01:02:04.721 --> 01:02:06.170
- He's not my man.

01:02:07.413 --> 01:02:11.037
So, maybe you can help
me get away from him.

01:02:12.418 --> 01:02:13.660
- You got a gun.

01:02:13.695 --> 01:02:14.489
- This?

01:02:14.523 --> 01:02:15.904
It's not even loaded.

01:02:15.939 --> 01:02:16.733
He took my clip.

01:02:21.185 --> 01:02:23.429
[thudding]

01:02:33.094 --> 01:02:33.991
[chuckling]

01:02:34.026 --> 01:02:35.234
- Comfortable?

01:02:35.268 --> 01:02:36.511
Is that better?

01:02:36.545 --> 01:02:38.099
'Cause that borrowed
suit you was wearing,

01:02:38.133 --> 01:02:39.583
it was a little snug.

01:02:39.617 --> 01:02:40.826
Kinda worried about ya,
thought you were gonna

01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:43.104
start singing soprano in
the Vienna Boys' Choir.

01:02:45.969 --> 01:02:46.763
Tough name.

01:02:47.729 --> 01:02:50.076
Anyway, it's like they say man.

01:02:50.111 --> 01:02:52.872
All's fair in love
and war and us,

01:02:52.907 --> 01:02:54.771
we're almost the
end of the line.

01:02:54.805 --> 01:02:56.048
- End of the line?

01:02:56.082 --> 01:02:58.636
Danny, what are
you talking about?

01:02:58.671 --> 01:03:02.019
- Mother fucker,
chess, I told you.

01:03:02.054 --> 01:03:05.022
I'm about to castle my rook
and I know you wanna knock

01:03:05.057 --> 01:03:07.611
all the pieces off the
board, make a big mess,

01:03:07.645 --> 01:03:09.440
but this game's still in effect.

01:03:10.648 --> 01:03:11.857
- What game?

01:03:11.891 --> 01:03:12.650
Danny, what are
you talking about?

01:03:12.685 --> 01:03:13.582
[doorbell ringing]

01:03:13.617 --> 01:03:14.376
- Ha, not now, my friend.

01:03:14.411 --> 01:03:15.999
I think we have guests.

01:03:16.033 --> 01:03:17.069
Ruby?

01:03:17.103 --> 01:03:20.003
[doorbell ringing]

01:03:24.973 --> 01:03:26.699
You're gonna love this.

01:03:26.733 --> 01:03:27.596
Check it out.

01:03:27.631 --> 01:03:29.495
Look what I did for you.

01:03:34.638 --> 01:03:36.640
Ladies and gentlemen, I know
you have a lot of questions.

01:03:36.674 --> 01:03:38.193
Let's get started.

01:03:38.228 --> 01:03:39.988
- What are your plans for a
sports themed fashion line?

01:03:40.023 --> 01:03:42.922
- Hey, hey, hey, this
is a Danny original.

01:03:42.957 --> 01:03:43.992
This man looks good, don't he?

01:03:44.027 --> 01:03:46.132
- When was your last fight?

01:03:46.167 --> 01:03:47.824
- It's been awhile,
it's been awhile,

01:03:47.858 --> 01:03:49.342
but it'll be alright.

01:03:49.377 --> 01:03:50.309
- Is there any truth to
the rumor that this fight

01:03:50.343 --> 01:03:51.966
isn't properly sanctioned?

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.899
- We have all of our paperwork.

01:03:53.933 --> 01:03:56.384
I'll have my secretary get
it to you in the morning.

01:03:56.418 --> 01:03:57.626
[mumbling]

01:03:57.661 --> 01:03:58.558
- Danny, I heard
you were indicted

01:03:58.593 --> 01:03:59.490
for illegal sports activity.

01:03:59.525 --> 01:04:00.698
Can you explain?

01:04:02.631 --> 01:04:03.563
- It's all conjecture.

01:04:03.598 --> 01:04:05.048
Nothing's ever been proven.

01:04:05.082 --> 01:04:07.222
- I heard that you had
to fight four pit bulls

01:04:07.257 --> 01:04:08.327
just to prepare for this fight.

01:04:08.361 --> 01:04:09.190
Is that true?

01:04:09.224 --> 01:04:10.432
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:04:10.467 --> 01:04:12.055
No dogs were hurt
during the training.

01:04:12.089 --> 01:04:12.883
We're animal lovers.

01:04:12.918 --> 01:04:14.126
We are dog people.

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:15.610
Love dogs.

01:04:15.644 --> 01:04:17.163
- Mr. Bolt, it's been 10
years since your last fight.

01:04:17.198 --> 01:04:19.165
Are you properly
trained for this?

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:20.546
- This man is a machine.

01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:21.927
This man is an
officer of the law.

01:04:21.961 --> 01:04:23.445
He is a policeman.

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:25.827
Every day out there on those
streets, that's his training.

01:04:25.862 --> 01:04:27.311
He's gonna be ready.

01:04:27.346 --> 01:04:28.899
- Danny, is there any truth
to the rumor that you're

01:04:28.934 --> 01:04:31.833
connected to a prostitution
ring with a man named Jimmy?

01:04:31.868 --> 01:04:33.317
- Ha ha ha!

01:04:33.352 --> 01:04:34.974
This press conference is over.

01:04:35.009 --> 01:04:36.217
Ruby.

01:04:36.251 --> 01:04:37.425
- [Ruby] You heard him.

01:04:37.459 --> 01:04:39.047
Get the fuck out!

01:04:39.082 --> 01:04:40.083
[chuckling]

01:04:40.117 --> 01:04:40.911
- Cheers.

01:04:42.706 --> 01:04:44.397
Y'all have a good day.

01:04:44.432 --> 01:04:45.226
Thank you for coming out.

01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:46.089
Appreciate you.

01:05:02.243 --> 01:05:03.140
- [Jackson] Remember that guy

01:05:03.175 --> 01:05:04.279
who helped me pull the trigger?

01:05:04.314 --> 01:05:06.212
Yeah, that's Rusty Brown.

01:05:06.247 --> 01:05:09.319
Another two-bit wannabe
gangster that works for Danny.

01:05:09.353 --> 01:05:11.183
His prints were all over my gun.

01:05:11.217 --> 01:05:13.702
- I tell you I had nothing
to do with it, man.

01:05:18.949 --> 01:05:20.226
You don't have any weapon.

01:05:21.814 --> 01:05:23.816
- You need us to show
it to you, dummy?

01:05:23.850 --> 01:05:26.715
We found the gun used to kill
Detective West Rassmuesen.

01:05:28.131 --> 01:05:30.443
- [Cop] It's got your
fingerprints all over it.

01:05:32.066 --> 01:05:33.136
- I been set up.

01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:38.520
- We got evidence tying you to
this and 10 other homicides.

01:05:38.555 --> 01:05:41.144
- [Cop] You've got
five minutes to think

01:05:41.178 --> 01:05:44.492
about what you're gonna do.

01:05:44.526 --> 01:05:45.942
It's gonna change your life.

01:05:47.909 --> 01:05:48.910
- Not in a good way.

01:05:52.327 --> 01:05:53.639
He ain't no killer.

01:05:53.673 --> 01:05:54.467
We should just let him go.

01:05:54.502 --> 01:05:56.021
- [Cop] Yeah, bullshit.

01:05:56.055 --> 01:05:58.402
- Just open the door, we don't
got enough evidence, do we?

01:05:58.437 --> 01:06:00.232
- Yeah, like I said.

01:06:01.198 --> 01:06:02.786
- We're gonna be here all night.

01:06:05.927 --> 01:06:07.618
- Have you talked
to your wife today?

01:06:07.653 --> 01:06:08.930
Do you know where she is?

01:06:10.414 --> 01:06:11.691
- Do you want me to
throw the fight, Danny?

01:06:11.726 --> 01:06:12.865
Is that it?

01:06:12.899 --> 01:06:14.142
- Throw the fight?

01:06:14.177 --> 01:06:17.111
I want you to die in the ring.

01:06:17.145 --> 01:06:18.215
Make it look good.

01:06:18.250 --> 01:06:21.805
Nine, 10 rounds, but die.

01:06:21.839 --> 01:06:24.601
And that's gonna be
checkmate mother fucker.

01:06:24.635 --> 01:06:26.534
- [Jackson] How does a man
on the run wanted for killing

01:06:26.568 --> 01:06:28.294
his partner [mumbling]
boxing ring?

01:06:31.228 --> 01:06:34.300
Somehow, Danny took
care of everything.

01:06:34.335 --> 01:06:36.958
[chattering]

01:06:36.993 --> 01:06:39.202
[thudding]

01:06:41.273 --> 01:06:43.516
[mumbling]

01:06:44.931 --> 01:06:48.659
[thudding]
[bell ringing]

01:06:48.694 --> 01:06:51.455
What about that
chick in my dreams?

01:06:51.490 --> 01:06:53.492
Turns out, she was an
expert at implanting

01:06:53.526 --> 01:06:55.321
mind control devices.

01:06:55.356 --> 01:06:57.565
She worked for
Danny, or that's what

01:06:57.599 --> 01:06:58.600
everyone thought at the time.

01:06:58.635 --> 01:06:59.808
- Get the fuck up.

01:07:01.810 --> 01:07:02.915
And you are gonna
tell me everything

01:07:02.949 --> 01:07:04.882
I fucking wanna know right now.

01:07:04.917 --> 01:07:06.436
- Please.

01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:08.058
- I wanna know where Darla is!

01:07:08.093 --> 01:07:09.473
- You don't understand.

01:07:09.508 --> 01:07:12.062
- [David] I don't care.

01:07:12.097 --> 01:07:13.753
- He's going to kill me!

01:07:13.788 --> 01:07:16.204
- I need to know
where Darla is now!

01:07:16.239 --> 01:07:18.586
[crowd chattering]
[thudding]

01:07:18.620 --> 01:07:21.209
[bell ringing]

01:07:27.491 --> 01:07:30.080
[mumbling]

01:07:30.115 --> 01:07:30.943
- Whoo!

01:07:39.952 --> 01:07:42.437
[tense music]

01:08:06.185 --> 01:08:07.945
[thudding]

01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:09.533
- Yeah! Yeah!

01:08:09.568 --> 01:08:11.259
- Whoo, whoo, whoo!

01:08:11.294 --> 01:08:12.640
[crowd cheering]

01:08:12.674 --> 01:08:14.918

01:08:30.209 --> 01:08:32.694
[tense music]

01:08:40.495 --> 01:08:41.738
- Oh Jackson.

01:08:41.772 --> 01:08:42.911
What the fuck did
you get me into?

01:08:47.813 --> 01:08:49.228
- Red, are you there?

01:08:49.263 --> 01:08:51.161
Red, it's about dinnertime.

01:08:51.196 --> 01:08:53.888
- Yeah, one more perimeter
sweep, then I'll take it in.

01:08:55.407 --> 01:08:57.892
[tense music]

01:09:02.517 --> 01:09:05.417
[gunshots blasting]

01:09:22.710 --> 01:09:24.298
[thudding]

01:09:24.332 --> 01:09:26.609
- They should stop the fight.

01:09:26.645 --> 01:09:29.578
[crowd chattering]

01:09:30.475 --> 01:09:32.720

01:09:32.754 --> 01:09:35.447

01:09:35.481 --> 01:09:37.689
[thudding]

01:09:46.042 --> 01:09:47.769
- [Jackson] All I had
to do to save Darla

01:09:47.804 --> 01:09:50.288
was allow myself to
get beaten to death.

01:09:50.323 --> 01:09:53.189
I'd do anything for Darla,
even laid out my life,

01:09:53.223 --> 01:09:54.638
and Danny knew that.

01:09:54.673 --> 01:09:57.814
He bet his entire life savings
on these fights tonight.

01:09:57.848 --> 01:10:00.610
[crowd cheering]

01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:06.650
- He's gettin' up.

01:10:06.685 --> 01:10:08.376
I can't believe it!

01:10:08.411 --> 01:10:10.930
[crowd cheering]

01:10:10.965 --> 01:10:14.417

[gunshots blasting]

01:10:47.346 --> 01:10:49.797
- Man, you guys really
need to learn how to shoot.

01:10:54.629 --> 01:10:59.255
[chattering]
[thudding]

01:11:01.809 --> 01:11:03.707

[thudding]

01:11:06.710 --> 01:11:08.229
- You think you're okay?

01:11:08.264 --> 01:11:10.818
- You do care about
me, don't you?

01:11:10.852 --> 01:11:13.407
- I just think we
make a great team.

01:11:13.441 --> 01:11:16.651
- Yeah, I think so too.

01:11:16.686 --> 01:11:20.172
- Were you serious
about going to Mexico?

01:11:20.206 --> 01:11:21.622
- Deadly serious.

01:11:22.899 --> 01:11:24.418
- So, we're really
leaving tonight?

01:11:24.452 --> 01:11:25.350
- We are.

01:11:25.384 --> 01:11:26.868
I've got the tickets right here.

01:11:27.731 --> 01:11:28.732
Midnight tonight.

01:11:30.009 --> 01:11:31.977
- Can you do me a favor, then?

01:11:32.011 --> 01:11:33.081
Please?

01:11:33.116 --> 01:11:33.944
- What is it?

01:11:35.187 --> 01:11:38.604
- Will you call your
brother and just ask him

01:11:38.639 --> 01:11:42.781
to leave my mom alone and
don't do anything to my baby?

01:11:42.815 --> 01:11:43.609
Just, just--

01:11:43.644 --> 01:11:44.472
- Come on.

01:11:44.507 --> 01:11:45.749
- Just for a few days.

01:11:45.784 --> 01:11:46.578
- Why? Why?

01:11:46.612 --> 01:11:47.475
- Please.

01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:48.338
- Why should I?

01:11:48.373 --> 01:11:49.166
- Please.

01:11:54.655 --> 01:11:55.966
- Bro.

01:11:56.001 --> 01:11:57.554
Yeah, it's me.

01:11:57.589 --> 01:11:58.624
You know what?

01:12:00.350 --> 01:12:03.077
I'm not gonna be calling
you for a few days.

01:12:03.111 --> 01:12:05.079
I'm gonna be gone
and when I get back

01:12:05.113 --> 01:12:07.115
that's when I'll call you,
so don't call me, okay?

01:12:07.150 --> 01:12:07.978
Goodbye.

01:12:13.984 --> 01:12:17.678
[thudding]
[grunting]

01:12:17.712 --> 01:12:19.127
- Ha!

01:12:27.343 --> 01:12:28.274
- Oh!

01:12:28.309 --> 01:12:29.275
[stammering]

01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:32.140
[gunshot blasting]

01:12:32.175 --> 01:12:33.072
- Are you okay?

01:12:36.973 --> 01:12:37.801
- I am now.

01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:41.598
Where's Darla?

01:12:41.633 --> 01:12:42.427
- [Sky] There.

01:12:46.603 --> 01:12:49.917
- This is the fighter that
Jackson Bolt is waiting for.

01:12:49.951 --> 01:12:53.714
The only fighter to beat
Jackson, 10 years ago.

01:12:53.748 --> 01:12:55.232
Over to Sheila,
with the interview.

01:12:55.267 --> 01:12:56.199
- Thank you, Rick.

01:12:56.233 --> 01:12:57.511
Hi, I'm here with Abrafo.

01:12:57.545 --> 01:12:59.444
How are you feeling
about today's fight?

01:12:59.478 --> 01:13:01.515
- I ain't thinking about it.

01:13:01.549 --> 01:13:02.550
- Is there anything
new that we should

01:13:02.585 --> 01:13:03.827
be expecting from you today?

01:13:03.862 --> 01:13:05.484
I know you're a very
successful kickboxer,

01:13:05.519 --> 01:13:07.555
so, we're all anticipating to
see what you do in the ring.

01:13:07.590 --> 01:13:09.419
- I'm gonna do the
same shit I did to Bolt

01:13:09.454 --> 01:13:12.180
that I did last
time, whoop his ass.

01:13:13.354 --> 01:13:16.081
[crowd chattering]
[thudding]

01:13:16.115 --> 01:13:18.946
- [Jackson] Abrafo was the one
fighter I could never beat.

01:13:20.396 --> 01:13:25.401
[thudding]
[crowd chattering]

01:13:28.576 --> 01:13:30.544
I guess this is the end.

01:13:30.578 --> 01:13:32.787
[mumbling]

01:13:33.857 --> 01:13:34.927
- Oh.

01:13:34.962 --> 01:13:36.308
- [Darla] David, my God.

01:13:36.342 --> 01:13:37.240
Get these things off me.

01:13:37.274 --> 01:13:39.035
- [David] I got you, I got you.

01:13:39.069 --> 01:13:42.279
[whimpering]

01:13:42.314 --> 01:13:44.454
[weeping]

01:13:53.532 --> 01:13:54.360
I got you.

01:13:57.605 --> 01:13:58.813
- [Darla] Where's Jackson?

01:13:58.848 --> 01:14:02.921
[phone ringing]
[crowd catcalling]

01:14:02.955 --> 01:14:03.749
- Hello?

01:14:05.786 --> 01:14:08.029
Jackson, it's for you.

01:14:08.064 --> 01:14:08.892
- Jackson.

01:14:09.790 --> 01:14:11.895
She's safe, I got her, man.

01:14:13.449 --> 01:14:14.277
I got her.

01:14:15.692 --> 01:14:18.419
[crowd cheering]

01:14:19.627 --> 01:14:21.836
[thudding]

01:14:28.774 --> 01:14:32.191
- I don't know what
the heck's happening.

01:14:36.472 --> 01:14:39.129
[tense music]

01:14:39.164 --> 01:14:44.134
[crowd chattering]
[bell ringing]

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.174
- I don't believe this.

01:14:49.208 --> 01:14:50.658
He's gonna throw
him outta the ring!

01:14:50.693 --> 01:14:53.281
[thudding]
[crowd booing]

01:14:53.316 --> 01:14:56.077
- [Jackson] Danny lost
every cent he had that day.

01:14:56.112 --> 01:14:59.805
[crowd chattering]

01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:02.118
[thudding]

01:15:05.535 --> 01:15:08.849
All he had to do was open his
briefcase and press a button.

01:15:08.883 --> 01:15:09.712
[mumbling]

01:15:09.746 --> 01:15:12.922
[chattering]

01:15:12.956 --> 01:15:15.683
[crowd cheering]

01:15:26.452 --> 01:15:28.696
[thudding]

01:15:32.907 --> 01:15:34.668
- [Jackson] Unless, of
course, someone thought

01:15:34.702 --> 01:15:36.393
Danny was too much
of a liability.

01:15:36.428 --> 01:15:41.433
[blasting]
[crowd catterwalling]

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:46.438
[thudding]

01:15:46.472 --> 01:15:48.716
[mumbling]

01:15:50.338 --> 01:15:51.270
â™ª I'm a statement

01:15:51.305 --> 01:15:52.617
â™ª [mumbling]

01:15:52.651 --> 01:15:53.997
â™ª No feelings at all

01:15:54.032 --> 01:15:55.999
- [Darla] Is that pineapple
pizza I can smell?

01:15:56.034 --> 01:15:57.898
- [Jackson] Yeah, I was hungry.

01:15:57.932 --> 01:15:59.451
- And you're not having this.

01:16:02.385 --> 01:16:04.836
- You know you shouldn't
be eating that.

01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:06.838
- I'm hungry, come on.

01:16:06.872 --> 01:16:08.598
- Why can't I look after you?

01:16:08.633 --> 01:16:10.393
David, hi.

01:16:10.427 --> 01:16:11.946
The big guy was just
talking about you.

01:16:11.981 --> 01:16:14.155
- Yeah, talking about
kicking my ass, right?

01:16:14.190 --> 01:16:15.536
- Oh, that's what it was.

01:16:15.571 --> 01:16:17.849
See, I thought he
said, "Kiss my ass."

01:16:17.883 --> 01:16:19.195
- No, I know I'm right.

01:16:19.229 --> 01:16:20.265
I'm sure of it.

01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:22.647
- Sky, how are you?

01:16:22.681 --> 01:16:24.096
- Marvelous.

01:16:24.131 --> 01:16:27.099
Now that I met the most
beautiful man I've ever seen.

01:16:28.342 --> 01:16:29.239
- Beautiful.

01:16:29.274 --> 01:16:30.862
She calls this beautiful.

01:16:30.896 --> 01:16:31.966
[chuckling]

01:16:32.001 --> 01:16:33.105
Whatever.

01:16:33.140 --> 01:16:34.313
[mumbling]

01:16:34.348 --> 01:16:35.625
- Shall I give
you guys a minute?

01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:38.179
- Nah, we just came in
to check on ya, buddy,

01:16:38.214 --> 01:16:39.042
see how you're doing.

01:16:39.077 --> 01:16:40.250
Want you to rest up.

01:16:40.285 --> 01:16:41.389
We'll come back and
see ya tomorrow.

01:16:41.424 --> 01:16:42.425
- Love you, partner.

01:16:42.459 --> 01:16:43.633
- Love you too, brother.

01:16:47.672 --> 01:16:49.397
- Thank you, Jackson.

01:16:53.643 --> 01:16:54.713
- Get outta here.

01:16:54.748 --> 01:16:55.818
[phone ringing]

01:16:55.852 --> 01:16:56.646
- [Darla]} Hello?

01:16:56.681 --> 01:16:57.474
- Hello, Darla?

01:16:57.509 --> 01:16:59.062
- Hi.

01:16:59.097 --> 01:17:00.236
How is your day going?

01:17:00.270 --> 01:17:01.686
- Nah, it's all going good.

01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:02.618
It's all going good.

01:17:02.652 --> 01:17:03.964
- Can he make an appointment?

01:17:03.998 --> 01:17:05.482
- No, that's a good idea.

01:17:05.517 --> 01:17:08.554
I think it would be nice if
both of you came in together.

01:17:08.589 --> 01:17:10.315
I'd love to see
both of you, okay?

01:17:10.349 --> 01:17:11.765
- Thanks, Tommy.

01:17:11.799 --> 01:17:13.387
- Alright, I look forward to it.

01:17:13.421 --> 01:17:14.250
Bye.

01:17:18.668 --> 01:17:19.807
- Tommy.

01:17:19.842 --> 01:17:20.636
- Oh.

01:17:22.983 --> 01:17:24.191
You know how I feel about him.

01:17:24.225 --> 01:17:26.538
- I know, but you
need to see him.

01:17:30.093 --> 01:17:31.336
- Go get me a pizza.

01:17:31.370 --> 01:17:32.199
[chuckling]

01:17:32.233 --> 01:17:33.062
- Stop it.

01:17:33.096 --> 01:17:35.443
[chuckling]

01:17:37.963 --> 01:17:38.861
- Oh, God.

01:17:38.895 --> 01:17:41.139
- Get some rest, okay?

01:17:41.173 --> 01:17:43.037
- Alright, love you.

01:17:43.072 --> 01:17:44.073
- Love you, too.

01:17:44.107 --> 01:17:45.108
- Get outta here.

01:17:45.143 --> 01:17:47.490
[chuckling]

01:17:57.742 --> 01:17:59.536
[clinking]

01:17:59.571 --> 01:18:02.056
[tense music]

01:18:02.954 --> 01:18:05.542
[uptempo music]

01:18:10.824 --> 01:18:12.377
â™ª I try to forget you

01:18:12.411 --> 01:18:14.793
â™ª I try to escape

01:18:14.828 --> 01:18:18.176
â™ª This feeling in my heart

01:18:18.210 --> 01:18:19.764
â™ª Try to erase you

01:18:19.798 --> 01:18:22.249
â™ª By running away

01:18:22.283 --> 01:18:26.046
â™ª But your love has
left me scarred

01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:29.843
â™ª Now I feel so lost inside

01:18:29.877 --> 01:18:33.605
â™ª My whole world's gone empty

01:18:33.639 --> 01:18:36.815
â™ª I just wanna feel alive

01:18:36.850 --> 01:18:39.715
â™ª Alive

01:18:39.749 --> 01:18:43.442
â™ª I climb the highest mountain

01:18:43.477 --> 01:18:47.653
â™ª Swim the seven seas

01:18:47.688 --> 01:18:51.692
â™ª Do anything for a
second chance at love

01:18:51.727 --> 01:18:54.212
â™ª That was meant for me

01:18:54.246 --> 01:18:56.973
â™ª There's no other
way of saying

01:18:57.008 --> 01:18:58.561
â™ª No other way to

01:18:58.595 --> 01:19:01.875
â™ª Get around these feelings

01:19:01.909 --> 01:19:04.015
â™ª You're the one

01:19:04.049 --> 01:19:05.223
â™ª You're the one

01:19:05.257 --> 01:19:09.952
â™ª Every day you
are my everything

01:19:11.091 --> 01:19:14.646
â™ª I don't want
nobody else but you

01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:17.166
[uptempo beat music]

01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:22.171
â™ª And if loving [mumbling]
all I wanna do

01:19:24.621 --> 01:19:27.452
â™ª And if you don't come back

01:19:27.486 --> 01:19:32.181
â™ª My whole life is through

01:19:32.215 --> 01:19:37.220
â™ª So I don't want
nobody else but you

01:19:38.981 --> 01:19:43.951
â™ª Nobody else but you

01:19:44.883 --> 01:19:46.229
â™ª Don't tell me it's over

01:19:46.264 --> 01:19:48.680
â™ª It's never too late

01:19:48.714 --> 01:19:51.925
â™ª If hope is all I have

01:19:51.959 --> 01:19:53.650
â™ª Then I'll keep on wishing

01:19:53.685 --> 01:19:55.998
â™ª I'll pray every day

01:19:56.032 --> 01:20:00.140
â™ª For the love that I once had

01:20:00.174 --> 01:20:03.419
â™ª 'Cause I feel so lost inside

01:20:03.453 --> 01:20:07.319
â™ª My whole world's gone empty

01:20:07.354 --> 01:20:12.359
â™ª I just wanna feel alive

01:20:13.670 --> 01:20:17.329
â™ª I'll climb the
highest mountain

01:20:17.364 --> 01:20:20.919
â™ª Sail the seven seas

01:20:20.954 --> 01:20:25.544
â™ª Do anything for a
second chance at love

01:20:25.579 --> 01:20:27.926
â™ª That was meant for me

01:20:27.961 --> 01:20:30.826
â™ª There's no other
way of saying

01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:32.103
â™ª No other way to

01:20:32.137 --> 01:20:36.003
â™ª Get around these feelings

01:20:36.038 --> 01:20:37.729
â™ª You're the one [mumbling]

01:20:37.763 --> 01:20:40.007
â™ª You're the one every day

01:20:40.042 --> 01:20:44.149
â™ª You're my everything

01:20:44.184 --> 01:20:49.120
â™ª I don't want
nobody else but you

01:20:51.053 --> 01:20:55.989
â™ª And if loving [mumbling]

01:20:58.508 --> 01:21:00.786
â™ª And if you don't come

01:21:00.821 --> 01:21:05.722
â™ª I realize it's through

01:21:06.862 --> 01:21:11.107
â™ª So I don't want
nobody else but you

01:21:12.522 --> 01:21:17.562
â™ª Nobody else but you

01:21:21.048 --> 01:21:24.362
â™ª Nobody else, nobody else

01:21:24.396 --> 01:21:28.228
â™ª No

01:21:28.262 --> 01:21:31.679
â™ª There's nobody
else, nobody else

01:21:31.714 --> 01:21:35.683
â™ª Nobody else but you

01:21:35.718 --> 01:21:37.582
