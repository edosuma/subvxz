38:32.533 --> 38:34.467
- Max needs help.
- I'll get the girls.

38:34.467 --> 38:36.467
We'll get everything in,
and then we'll just go in one.

38:36.467 --> 38:37.600
- Perfect.
- We don't need to be like...

38:37.600 --> 38:39.200
- All right.

38:39.200 --> 38:40.600
- Lauren, Lauren, Hannah.
Get ready.

38:40.600 --> 38:42.233
We're gonna go to the beach.
Now, now.

38:42.233 --> 38:43.667
- What's taking so long?
- All right, ladies.

38:43.667 --> 38:45.333
Are we ready?
- Thank you.

38:45.333 --> 38:47.600
- Max?
At the beach?

38:47.600 --> 38:49.367
- You're gonna love your picnic.

38:50.734 --> 38:53.700
- Definitely got a interesting
way of managing.

38:53.700 --> 38:55.633
- Oh, my gosh.

38:55.633 --> 38:57.433
- Yay.

38:57.433 --> 38:59.300
- You all right?
- Hey, Max.

38:59.300 --> 39:02.533
- Everyone's having fun, and
I'm sweating my bollocks off.

39:02.533 --> 39:04.533
- Such a glamorous life,
isn't it?

39:04.533 --> 39:05.700
- Yeah.

39:05.700 --> 39:07.567
Number one
beach picnic organizer.

39:07.567 --> 39:09.033
- It's okay.
- [groans]

39:09.033 --> 39:10.266
- Thank you.

39:11.633 --> 39:12.633
- Where's the bow line?

39:12.633 --> 39:14.033
Supposed to be in your hand.

39:14.033 --> 39:15.300
Go back to the steering wheel.

39:15.300 --> 39:16.567
You're in forward.

39:16.567 --> 39:18.400
I want you to go back out there,

39:18.400 --> 39:20.533
and I want you to practice going
in and out of reverse, okay?

39:20.533 --> 39:22.266
We're limited with crew members.

39:22.266 --> 39:24.567
I want her to feel confident
in handling that tender.

39:24.567 --> 39:26.667
I want the bow line
in your hand.

39:26.667 --> 39:29.433
Practice.
Go forward, go reverse.

39:29.433 --> 39:31.133
- But, like, we're on charter.

39:31.133 --> 39:32.667
That's not the time
to be training people.

39:32.667 --> 39:35.467
- How is the food getting here?
- Uh, tender.

39:35.467 --> 39:38.133
- That's how you learn.
Reverse.

39:38.133 --> 39:41.600
- We're right in the middle of
getting the beach picnic set up.

39:41.600 --> 39:44.333
Interior's counting on me.
I'm feeling very nervous.

39:44.333 --> 39:47.066
- Come get me--I've got to show
you how to do it.

39:47.066 --> 39:48.300
- F---.

39:48.300 --> 39:49.300
[tense music]

39:53.266 --> 39:53.500
- All right, so,

39:53.500 --> 39:54.100
- All right, so,
here's what we're gonna do.

39:55.734 --> 39:57.200
Ready?
- Oh, my God, poor Malia.

39:57.200 --> 39:58.667
- See how this bow line's here?
- Yeah.

39:58.667 --> 40:00.433
- I like that
the captain's so involved.

40:00.433 --> 40:03.033
- You worked on a dive boat,
so you understand

40:03.033 --> 40:06.133
how efficient one needs to be
on their own.

40:06.133 --> 40:09.567
- I don't know how
she hasn't snapped.

40:09.567 --> 40:11.734
- Adam, Hannah.
What's your ETA?

40:11.734 --> 40:13.133
- I'm ready when you are.
Waiting.

40:13.133 --> 40:14.433
It's all cold food.

40:14.433 --> 40:16.233
- Legend.
Thank you.

40:16.233 --> 40:18.300
- Don't stand there
and watch me.

40:18.300 --> 40:20.100
Go find something else to do.

40:20.100 --> 40:21.300
- Okay.

40:21.300 --> 40:22.734
If I was chief stew,

40:22.734 --> 40:24.333
Adam would never talk to me
that way.

40:24.333 --> 40:26.100
- And that's how
you speak your mind.

40:26.100 --> 40:27.600
- Sandy, Sandy, Hannah?

40:27.600 --> 40:30.200
If we could get a tender run
quickly with the food,

40:30.200 --> 40:31.500
that would be great.

40:31.500 --> 40:33.633
It's not the time to be
giving lessons.

40:33.633 --> 40:35.500
Can we not wait till
the guests get off

40:35.500 --> 40:37.433
and we're not in the middle
of a beach picnic?

40:37.433 --> 40:39.467
- Yes, ready to go
to the beach, guys?

40:39.467 --> 40:41.200
- Yeah.
- Awesome.

40:41.200 --> 40:42.467
All the guests are ready,
so they're just

40:42.467 --> 40:44.500
gonna bring it all together.

40:44.500 --> 40:46.166
- She's gonna send the food now,

40:46.166 --> 40:47.767
at the same time
as the guests,

40:47.767 --> 40:49.767
which is exactly what
I didn't want to do,

40:49.767 --> 40:52.033
'cause I wanted everything
set up before they got here.

40:52.033 --> 40:53.700
I really don't know
whether I'm gonna last

40:53.700 --> 40:55.433
the charter season
with this captain.

40:55.433 --> 40:57.633
Like, I'm getting annoyed,
which is really scary,

40:57.633 --> 41:00.333
'cause it's day three.
- Yeah.

41:00.333 --> 41:03.133
- This season on
"Below Deck Mediterranean"...

41:03.133 --> 41:05.100
[all toasting]

41:05.100 --> 41:08.100
- I absolutely love Croatia.
It's just so magical.

41:08.100 --> 41:09.367
- This is why you let
the captain decide

41:09.367 --> 41:10.400
where you're going.

41:10.400 --> 41:12.000
- [screaming]

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
- It's my first time
in Croatia,

41:13.000 --> 41:14.400
and it's awesome.

41:14.400 --> 41:16.000
[laughs]

41:16.000 --> 41:18.066
- We all live, drink, eat,

41:18.066 --> 41:19.133
work together...

41:19.133 --> 41:20.500
all: Oh!

41:20.500 --> 41:22.533
I'm a yachtie.
It's what we do.

41:22.533 --> 41:24.200
- They're not wearing
any clothes.

41:24.200 --> 41:25.533
- There are unmentionable parts

41:25.533 --> 41:27.633
staring right into my eyeballs.

41:27.633 --> 41:29.000
- [laughs]
- Oh, no.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.467
- You've got beautiful women.

41:30.467 --> 41:32.066
You've got lots of money.

41:32.066 --> 41:33.367
I feel like there
is some flirting.

41:33.367 --> 41:36.100
I get distracted by the ladies.

41:36.100 --> 41:37.533
- Well,
it's got onions all in it.

41:37.533 --> 41:40.000
- Can we get another one
with no chives?

41:40.000 --> 41:41.567
- Well, that's not gonna
happen, so they can f--- off.

41:41.567 --> 41:43.533
- Sometimes the actions of one

41:43.533 --> 41:45.300
have consequences for the many.

41:45.300 --> 41:47.433
- We need somebody to help us
with a flight to Spain.

41:47.433 --> 41:49.133
- So you're their travel agent?

41:49.133 --> 41:51.166
- The sink is overflowing.
I need help.

41:51.166 --> 41:53.033
Everyone saw.

41:53.033 --> 41:54.633
- You have two co-workers

41:54.633 --> 41:56.166
with your tongue
in their mouths.

41:56.166 --> 41:57.367
- That's probably a bad idea.

41:57.367 --> 41:59.000
- Is this like a threesome?

41:59.000 --> 42:00.133
- I've never hooked up
with a crewmate.

42:00.133 --> 42:01.700
It'll make all of us look bad.

42:01.700 --> 42:04.367
- If I want to go around
and f--- everyone on this boat,

42:04.367 --> 42:05.667
that's my prerogative.

42:05.667 --> 42:07.100
- I kissed a f---ing whore.

42:07.100 --> 42:08.133
- Thanks for your support,
Lauren.

42:08.133 --> 42:09.700
Why don't you go f--- Ben?

42:09.700 --> 42:12.500
- I'm being ostracized over
this whole Bobby thing.

42:12.500 --> 42:14.667
It never ends well for the girl
that breaks girl code.

42:14.667 --> 42:16.100
- Stop, stop!
F---.

42:16.100 --> 42:17.266
I ruined it.
- Jesus Christ!

42:17.266 --> 42:18.567
- That can never happen.

42:18.567 --> 42:19.767
- I just give the guests
what they ask for

42:19.767 --> 42:21.400
on their preference sheet.

42:21.400 --> 42:23.200
- What's that,
a resting bitch face?

42:23.200 --> 42:25.734
- F--- you, bro.
- No, no, no, no!

42:25.734 --> 42:27.200
- Oh, God!
Woman down.

42:27.200 --> 42:28.433
- Don't be a smartass.

42:28.433 --> 42:30.266
- Don't tell me
what to do, Bobby.

42:30.266 --> 42:32.300
- I feel this season,
you've been a lousy chief stew.

42:32.300 --> 42:34.533
- Guys, you're now looking
at the new lead deckhand.

42:34.533 --> 42:35.734
- You guys have had relations.

42:35.734 --> 42:37.333
It's a conflict of interest.

42:37.333 --> 42:39.166
That is Leadership 101.

42:39.166 --> 42:41.033
- You cannot cross that line.

42:41.033 --> 42:42.600
- Do you want to go speak
to Captain Sandy about it?

42:42.600 --> 42:44.000
- Bobby, get over it, bro.

42:44.000 --> 42:45.533
[glass shattering]
- Holy sh--!

42:45.533 --> 42:46.600
- What was that?
- [gasps]

42:46.600 --> 42:48.066
- Croatia doesn't deserve

42:48.066 --> 42:49.300
all of this f---ing drama.

42:49.300 --> 42:51.300
- There is blood everywhere.

42:51.300 --> 42:53.667
- Suck it up,
and don't bring it on deck.

42:53.667 --> 42:56.066
- F---ing kidding me?
F--- off.

42:56.066 --> 42:57.567
[air spraying]

42:57.567 --> 42:59.333
- [squeaky voice] Yeah,
this is definitely helium.

42:59.333 --> 43:01.066
[laughter]

43:01.066 --> 43:03.233
