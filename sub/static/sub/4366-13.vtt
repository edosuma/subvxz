WEBVTT

00:01.972 --> 00:03.598
You are being watched.

00:04.133 --> 00:06.535
The government
has a secret system--

00:06.537 --> 00:11.156
A machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

00:11.158 --> 00:13.408
I know, because I built it.

00:13.410 --> 00:15.744
I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror,

00:15.746 --> 00:17.613
but it sees everything...

00:17.615 --> 00:20.365
Violent crimes
involving ordinary people,

00:20.367 --> 00:21.816
people like you,

00:21.818 --> 00:25.487
crimes the government
considered irrelevant.

00:25.489 --> 00:28.857
They wouldn't act,
so I decided I would.

00:28.859 --> 00:30.709
But I needed a partner--

00:30.711 --> 00:33.428
Someone with the skills
to intervene.

00:33.430 --> 00:37.633
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

00:37.635 --> 00:39.551
You will never find us.

00:39.553 --> 00:41.553
But victim or perpetrator,

00:41.555 --> 00:44.489
if your number's up,
we'll find you.

01:15.421 --> 01:18.223
Good morning, Mr. Reese.

01:24.230 --> 01:25.880
Mr. Reese?

01:25.882 --> 01:28.767
A bit of a bad connection.

01:28.769 --> 01:30.819
Were you able
to convince Mr. Billick

01:30.821 --> 01:32.821
to abandon his plan
to kill his ex-wife?

01:32.823 --> 01:35.524
I'm working on it, Finch.

01:35.526 --> 01:36.908
Whoa-ah!

01:46.402 --> 01:48.537
Yeah, Finch. What is it?

02:08.524 --> 02:12.361
Pretty sure that's
a parole violation, Teddy.

02:12.363 --> 02:14.396
Hello, Finch.

02:14.398 --> 02:16.398
Billick and I just came
to an understanding.

02:16.400 --> 02:18.900
Good,
because we have a new number.

02:18.902 --> 02:21.269
Had a feeling
you were going to say that.

02:21.271 --> 02:22.487
I'm sending you an address.

02:22.489 --> 02:23.938
Call me when you get there.

02:23.940 --> 02:26.775
You sure he's the right guy?

02:26.777 --> 02:30.379
He's perfect.

02:35.718 --> 02:37.969
So what's this guy's story,
Finch?

02:37.971 --> 02:41.473
Scott Powell-- 38.

02:41.475 --> 02:44.459
He's a construction
project manager for the city.

02:44.461 --> 02:46.628
Seems like a family man.

02:46.630 --> 02:48.230
His wife's name is Leslie.

02:48.232 --> 02:51.516
Son is Owen, daughter Mia.

02:51.518 --> 02:52.934
Oh, my goodness.

02:52.936 --> 02:54.135
What are you working on there?
A doggie?

02:54.137 --> 02:55.487
A horse.

02:55.489 --> 02:56.738
It's a horse.
Of course it's a horse.

02:56.740 --> 02:59.024
I knew it was a horse.
I was just testing.

02:59.026 --> 03:00.325
Did you lose your watch?

03:00.327 --> 03:03.111
Uh, no.
It's around here somewhere.

03:03.113 --> 03:06.081
All right, guys,
daddy's got to go to work.

03:06.083 --> 03:07.999
- All right. Bye.
- Love you, baby.

03:08.001 --> 03:09.968
- You too. Be good.
- All right.

03:11.754 --> 03:14.623
Are you still there,
Mr. Reese?

03:14.625 --> 03:17.542
You ever crave a more
conventional life, Finch?

03:17.544 --> 03:21.747
If by "conventional" you mean
a life without the numbers,

03:21.749 --> 03:24.199
it has crossed my mind.

03:24.201 --> 03:27.335
It looks like Powell
has a pretty normal one.

03:27.337 --> 03:29.438
If there's one thing
our little venture

03:29.440 --> 03:31.690
has proven, Mr. Reese,
it's that people are rarely

03:31.692 --> 03:35.844
what they seem.

03:43.286 --> 03:46.621
Finch, looks like Powell's
playing hooky.

03:46.623 --> 03:48.707
He's heading into a park.

03:48.709 --> 03:49.958
Could be meeting somebody.

03:49.960 --> 03:53.211
Are you up on his phone?

03:53.213 --> 03:55.330
I'm about to be.

04:07.677 --> 04:08.860
Hi, yeah.

04:08.862 --> 04:11.062
Calling about the installer job
you have listed

04:11.064 --> 04:13.014
in the--
in the paper here.

04:13.016 --> 04:15.100
I'm sorry, sir.
That position's been filled.

04:15.102 --> 04:17.853
Oh. Um,
well, do you have

04:17.855 --> 04:19.738
any other positions available
at this time? Or--

04:22.108 --> 04:25.527
Finch, Powell's
not skipping work,

04:25.529 --> 04:26.528
he's out of work.

04:26.530 --> 04:28.029
Yes.

04:28.031 --> 04:30.749
I'm just discovering that
the city's employee directory

04:30.751 --> 04:32.467
is grossly out of date.

04:32.469 --> 04:34.669
A casualty
of public employee cutbacks.

04:34.671 --> 04:37.372
The same cutbacks have put
Mr. Powell out of a job--

04:37.374 --> 04:38.740
Eight months ago.

04:38.742 --> 04:42.377
Judging by the way
he was acting with his family,

04:42.379 --> 04:44.429
they have no idea.

04:44.431 --> 04:47.616
That's a long time to go
without a paycheck.

04:55.090 --> 04:58.560
These flutes are silver plated.

04:58.562 --> 05:01.062
And engraved.
I ain't expecting

05:01.064 --> 05:03.198
another Leslie and Scott
to come in the shop.

05:03.200 --> 05:06.067
Look, I can't use
any of this stuff.

05:06.069 --> 05:07.903
Now, if you have another watch

05:07.905 --> 05:11.406
like you had the last time...

05:17.112 --> 05:19.781
I'll let you have all
of it for 100 bucks.

05:19.783 --> 05:22.000
- Sorry.
- 50.

05:22.002 --> 05:24.503
Look, pal,
take your junk and clear out,

05:24.505 --> 05:26.304
- all right?
- Don't call my stuff junk!

05:26.306 --> 05:30.592
Hey, you want
I should call the cops?

05:30.594 --> 05:33.311
No, man.

05:38.818 --> 05:40.769
Finch, this guy's about ready
to hit rock bottom.

05:40.771 --> 05:42.070
I ran Powell's credit.

05:42.072 --> 05:43.805
He's maxed out on every one
of his cards

05:43.807 --> 05:45.857
with the exception of the one
he shares with his wife.

05:45.859 --> 05:47.442
And that's almost at its limit.

05:47.444 --> 05:49.661
You suspect
he might be a threat?

05:49.663 --> 05:52.163
Well, he just about took
a pawnbroker's head off

05:52.165 --> 05:53.915
for a few bucks.
See if Detective Carter

05:53.917 --> 05:56.150
can run a background check
on this guy.

05:56.152 --> 05:57.986
What about Detective Fusco?

05:57.988 --> 05:59.754
He's handling another matter
right now.

05:59.756 --> 06:00.872
I'll keep a close eye on Powell

06:00.874 --> 06:02.007
until we know
what we're dealing with.

06:02.009 --> 06:03.508
Good.
And I'm going to want

06:03.510 --> 06:05.493
to get a look
at his home computer.

06:05.495 --> 06:06.962
So I'll be joining you tonight.

06:06.964 --> 06:10.665
Really.
Ever been on a stakeout, Finch?

06:10.667 --> 06:11.967
No.
Should I bring anything?

06:11.969 --> 06:13.668
Warm clothes,
something to read,

06:13.670 --> 06:16.805
- and an empty water bottle.
- Empty?

06:16.807 --> 06:19.658
There are no bathrooms
on a stakeout, Finch.

06:29.518 --> 06:31.786
He's getting good
at leading two lives.

06:31.788 --> 06:34.239
Unfortunately,
they're on a collision course.

06:39.712 --> 06:41.413
Hungry already, Finch?

06:41.415 --> 06:44.583
No. And if I was,
it wouldn't be for something

06:44.585 --> 06:49.504
with...
Disodium inosinate.

06:49.506 --> 06:54.142
Can is made of aluminum.

06:54.144 --> 06:55.594
Its dimensions are perfect

06:55.596 --> 06:59.180
for capturing wi-fi radio waves.

07:05.271 --> 07:08.857
Point this at the house.

07:10.660 --> 07:15.230
His home wi-fi network
has WPA password protection.

07:15.232 --> 07:17.799
- Can you crack it?
- Just did.

07:19.369 --> 07:23.004
Spends a lot of time
on political websites,

07:23.006 --> 07:26.341
blogging about a congressman--
Michael Delancey.

07:26.343 --> 07:29.711
Not a big fan
of the Congressman.

07:31.080 --> 07:33.798
This is interesting.
Here's a big file--

07:33.800 --> 07:37.919
Encrypted.

07:41.223 --> 07:43.257
I'm going to have to take this.

07:43.259 --> 07:46.478
I'll be right back.

07:49.765 --> 07:50.982
Hello.

07:50.984 --> 07:52.100
Mr. Powell?

07:52.102 --> 07:53.535
This is
the Work Time temp agency.

07:53.537 --> 07:56.821
You called us several weeks ago
about an event staff position.

07:56.823 --> 07:59.724
- Uh-huh.
- We have two-day job placement

07:59.726 --> 08:01.326
for you,
if you're still available.

08:01.328 --> 08:03.111
Absolutely, yes.

08:03.113 --> 08:06.948
They need you there
at 12:30.

08:06.950 --> 08:08.583
Sounds great.
Thank you very much.

08:08.585 --> 08:11.953
Thank you very much.

08:11.955 --> 08:15.456
Looks like Powell's fortunes
may be turning around.

08:15.458 --> 08:18.259
I hope so.

08:18.261 --> 08:21.730
But we still don't know why
the machine gave us his number.

08:33.193 --> 08:34.359
Detective?

08:34.361 --> 08:36.309
Looked up your guy.

08:36.312 --> 08:38.163
Nothing but a couple
of traffic tickets

08:38.164 --> 08:40.664
and an application
for a firearms license

08:40.667 --> 08:42.884
for a rifle.
Otherwise he's clean.

08:42.885 --> 08:44.652
I see.
Okay, thank you.

08:44.654 --> 08:47.122
Should I
be worried about this guy?

08:47.124 --> 08:51.659
That's what we're trying
to determine, Detective.

08:51.661 --> 08:54.462
That file
from Powell's computer,

08:54.464 --> 08:58.950
it was a PGP-encrypted,
anonymous email account.

08:58.952 --> 09:02.187
All these emails are addressed

09:02.189 --> 09:04.272
to congressman Delancey's office.

09:04.274 --> 09:07.158
The same congressman
that Powell had a beef with?

09:07.160 --> 09:09.360
Delancey pushed
for the budgetary cutbacks

09:09.362 --> 09:11.396
that prompted the city layoffs.

09:11.398 --> 09:13.848
He cost Powell his job.

09:13.850 --> 09:18.953
So why would Powell be working
a fundraiser for Delancey?

09:18.955 --> 09:21.956
Does he own
any registered weapons?

09:21.958 --> 09:24.459
Carter said he applied
for a firearms license--

09:24.461 --> 09:26.544
A rifle.

09:26.546 --> 09:29.998
These are death threats,
Mr. Reese.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.533
Powell's not here for a job,

09:32.535 --> 09:34.652
he's going
to assassinate Delancey.

09:57.500 --> 09:58.866
Mr. Reese,

09:58.868 --> 10:00.201
did you find Powell?

10:00.203 --> 10:02.837
We need to get to him before
he gets to the congressman.

10:08.427 --> 10:10.228
Sir,

10:10.230 --> 10:12.347
you need to come through
the main line.

10:12.349 --> 10:17.235
Thanks.

10:17.237 --> 10:18.770
We've got a problem, Finch,

10:18.772 --> 10:21.940
Powell's already inside.

10:25.894 --> 10:28.196
We should probably get
in there then.

10:40.075 --> 10:43.244
You stay close
to the congressman.

10:43.246 --> 10:45.597
Keep your eyes open
and be ready to move.

10:45.599 --> 10:48.716
Move?
If somebody starts shooting,

10:48.718 --> 10:51.019
what exactly
do you expect me to do?

10:51.021 --> 10:54.272
You'll think of something,
Finch.

11:06.268 --> 11:08.069
Polls look good, Mike.

11:08.071 --> 11:09.904
Thanks to your endorsement,
Senator.

11:09.906 --> 11:12.273
Do you remember Pete Matheson
my campaign manager?

11:12.275 --> 11:14.125
Sure.
You're doing a hell of a job.

11:14.127 --> 11:17.796
Oh, thank you, Senator.
Thank you very much.

11:17.798 --> 11:21.166
Powell must be downstairs
with the staff.

11:21.168 --> 11:23.668
- Are you with Delancey?
- Close by.

11:23.670 --> 11:25.136
Listen, listen, Mike.

11:25.138 --> 11:26.838
Uh, as long as a got you,
let me ask you a favor.

11:26.840 --> 11:29.290
Back off the rhetoric,
understand?

11:29.292 --> 11:32.260
Calling out certain large donors
makes for great stumping,

11:32.262 --> 11:34.429
but it also
makes people uncomfortable.

11:34.431 --> 11:36.264
By "people," you mean you?

11:36.266 --> 11:38.466
Just keep it in mind,
Congressman.

11:38.468 --> 11:40.785
We want you
to have a long, long career.

11:42.688 --> 11:43.938
Listen, this is odd.

11:43.940 --> 11:45.773
Those threatening emails
that Powell sent

11:45.775 --> 11:46.858
to the Congressman--

11:46.860 --> 11:49.077
They're being flagged
by my system.

11:49.079 --> 11:50.328
Ladies and gentlemen,

11:50.330 --> 11:51.646
we'd like you
to please take your seats.

11:51.648 --> 11:53.981
- Thank you.
- Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

11:53.983 --> 11:55.483
Thank you for joining us
this afternoon.

11:55.485 --> 11:56.951
I'm Pete Matheson.

11:56.953 --> 11:58.703
You know, a few years back,

11:58.705 --> 12:02.340
my friend and business partner
came to me and said,

12:02.342 --> 12:04.442
"hey, I'm thinking
of running for office."

12:07.763 --> 12:09.013
...Popular,

12:09.015 --> 12:10.998
I think we can all agree
that they have always been...

12:11.000 --> 12:12.433
The IP addresses match,

12:12.435 --> 12:15.854
but there are big discrepancies
in the TTL values,

12:15.856 --> 12:17.889
and the headers are failing
to authenticate.

12:17.891 --> 12:19.357
What are you getting at, Finch?

12:19.359 --> 12:21.142
Those anonymous emails
didn't originate

12:21.144 --> 12:22.527
in Powell's laptop.

12:22.529 --> 12:26.180
They were copied onto it
from a remote location.

12:26.182 --> 12:28.533
Finch, I'm more interested
in finding the guy with the gun

12:28.535 --> 12:29.951
than I am
in fixing his computer.

12:29.953 --> 12:32.904
Congressman Michael Delancey.

12:36.175 --> 12:40.027
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you for coming.

12:40.029 --> 12:41.045
And thank you too.

12:42.132 --> 12:43.698
I think his system's
been hacked.

12:45.552 --> 12:47.819
Mr. Reese?

12:52.725 --> 12:54.208
- Mr. Reese?
- Ow!

12:54.210 --> 12:56.877
- Confetti?
- I think Powell's being set up.

13:09.692 --> 13:12.493
There he is! There!

13:12.495 --> 13:14.479
In the balcony!

13:53.402 --> 13:56.955
I can't tell how badly
the Congressman is wounded.

13:56.957 --> 13:58.990
Yeah, I lost the real shooter.

13:58.992 --> 14:02.443
The emails, the job--
Powell was set up.

14:02.445 --> 14:04.228
Listen to me!
It wasn't me!

14:04.230 --> 14:05.747
I didn't do anything!

14:05.749 --> 14:07.749
Why won't you listen to me?

14:07.751 --> 14:09.917
The question is, by who?

14:28.185 --> 14:32.188
This is a shocking
and a tragic day.

14:32.190 --> 14:33.939
We're all just praying
that he'll pull through.

14:33.941 --> 14:35.574
That's-- that's all.

14:35.576 --> 14:37.777
Whoever shot
Congressman Delancey

14:37.779 --> 14:39.779
and framed Powell
went to a lot of trouble.

14:39.781 --> 14:41.197
They had to hack his computer,

14:41.199 --> 14:43.916
they spoofed his Internet
search history and emails.

14:43.918 --> 14:46.402
They knew exactly
what information to manipulate

14:46.404 --> 14:48.371
so that he looked guilty
to the police.

14:48.373 --> 14:51.674
Fooled us...
And your machine.

14:51.676 --> 14:55.177
No, the machine doesn't
get fooled.

14:55.179 --> 15:01.083
If Powell isn't the threat,
then he must be in danger.

15:01.085 --> 15:03.552
Well, he's the patsy then.

15:03.554 --> 15:07.223
Maybe he wasn't supposed to make
it out of the fundraiser alive.

15:07.225 --> 15:09.425
Did you get a look
at the shooter?

15:09.427 --> 15:12.978
Not a good one.
But he was a pro.

15:12.980 --> 15:16.098
Deadeye shot
with a preplanned escape route.

15:16.100 --> 15:18.200
Different skill set
than our hacker, so...

15:18.202 --> 15:20.820
Different people?

15:20.822 --> 15:22.604
We're looking at a team.

15:22.606 --> 15:24.106
First thing to determine

15:24.108 --> 15:27.042
is how the hacker
got into his computer.

15:27.044 --> 15:28.944
This may take me a little time.

15:28.946 --> 15:32.248
I'll check on Powell.

15:35.586 --> 15:38.854
You.
I thought I could trust you.

15:42.843 --> 15:45.978
Your partner said
I shouldn't worry about Powell.

15:45.980 --> 15:47.796
Then he goes and shoots
a congressman.

15:47.798 --> 15:50.232
And now the feds brought him
in to my precinct.

15:50.234 --> 15:52.134
He didn't do it.
I was there.

15:52.136 --> 15:54.103
Well, we got a banquet hall
full of witnesses

15:54.105 --> 15:56.972
- saying otherwise.
- Right. Well, he was set up.

15:56.974 --> 16:00.159
- Set up? By who?
- We don't know yet.

16:00.161 --> 16:01.861
But we could use some help.

16:01.863 --> 16:04.246
There's not much I can do.

16:04.248 --> 16:05.998
The feds are running this show.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.484
They're taking him into
interrogation now.

16:08.486 --> 16:09.785
I need to know
what they're saying.

16:09.787 --> 16:11.787
I told you,
there's nothing I can do.

16:11.789 --> 16:17.009
Carter, it could help save
an innocent man.

16:17.011 --> 16:18.294
I didn't shoot anyone.

16:18.296 --> 16:20.129
It was your rifle
found at the scene.

16:20.131 --> 16:21.714
I don't own a rifle!

16:21.716 --> 16:23.849
It's registered in your name.

16:23.851 --> 16:28.053
- It must have been the guy.
- Uh, which guy exactly?

16:28.055 --> 16:31.307
The one you say attacked you?
Or the who worked there.

16:31.309 --> 16:34.109
No, the guy who-- who--
who worked there

16:34.111 --> 16:37.146
who took me up to the balcony
to rig the confetti cannon.

16:37.148 --> 16:38.781
No one on the staff
saw this guy.

16:38.783 --> 16:40.816
And he's not
in any security footage.

16:40.818 --> 16:43.903
He was right there.

16:43.905 --> 16:46.021
I saw him.

16:46.023 --> 16:47.540
He must have known
where the cameras were.

16:47.542 --> 16:49.792
This whole thing is a setup.

16:49.794 --> 16:51.360
Did you call
the staffing agency?

16:51.362 --> 16:53.128
There's no record
of any company named Work Time

16:53.130 --> 16:54.213
in the tristate area.

16:54.215 --> 16:56.248
That's impossible.
They called me.

16:56.250 --> 16:59.468
What about your gloves?

16:59.470 --> 17:01.687
Why'd they test positive
for gunshot residue?

17:01.689 --> 17:03.389
I don't know.
I got them from the guy.

17:03.391 --> 17:06.392
Right, right.
The guy.

17:19.772 --> 17:21.022
You still there?

17:21.025 --> 17:22.907
Yeah.
What happened?

17:22.910 --> 17:24.410
Hospital just called.

17:24.412 --> 17:27.378
Congressman Delancey
didn't make it.

17:29.833 --> 17:33.886
Powell's looking at murder one.

17:37.207 --> 17:38.874
Les, it's me.

17:38.876 --> 17:40.759
Oh, my God, Scott,
where are you?

17:40.761 --> 17:42.545
It's all a big mistake.

17:42.547 --> 17:44.797
The FBI is searching the house.

17:44.799 --> 17:48.750
- The news says you shot someone.
- No, listen.

17:48.752 --> 17:51.554
These things they're saying,
Leslie, they're all lies.

17:51.556 --> 17:54.256
- No. Are the kids with you?
- Yes.

17:54.258 --> 17:56.275
I want you to take them
next door, okay?

17:56.277 --> 17:59.028
- Okay.
- Now, listen.

17:59.030 --> 18:01.230
They're probably going
to ask you to go with them

18:01.232 --> 18:03.265
and answer some questions.

18:03.267 --> 18:05.784
Now, Leslie--
Leslie, listen to me.

18:05.786 --> 18:07.269
You do what they ask, okay?

18:07.271 --> 18:11.240
Okay.

18:11.242 --> 18:12.908
You have another computer?

18:12.910 --> 18:15.461
No.
What computer?

18:17.831 --> 18:20.449
- What's going on, Scott?
- I don't know.

18:20.451 --> 18:23.252
I need you to trust me, okay?

18:23.254 --> 18:26.171
Everything's going
to be all right.

18:26.173 --> 18:28.007
I love you.

18:28.009 --> 18:30.142
I love you too.

18:38.268 --> 18:40.352
What is it?

18:40.354 --> 18:43.138
I think Powell
could still be in danger.

18:43.140 --> 18:44.490
How so?

18:44.492 --> 18:47.076
In frame jobs, the decoy
usually doesn't make it.

18:47.078 --> 18:49.511
If they're not taken out
at the scene,

18:49.513 --> 18:51.130
they're eliminated soon after...

18:51.132 --> 18:53.916
Staged to look
like a suicide or accident.

18:53.918 --> 18:56.518
Are you speaking
from experience, Mr. Reese?

18:56.520 --> 18:57.886
Point is it ties up
the loose ends.

18:59.023 --> 19:01.590
Here.
I think I may have found a way

19:01.592 --> 19:03.592
- to our hacker.
- How?

19:03.594 --> 19:07.046
A trojan horse...Hidden
in one of Powell's emails.

19:07.048 --> 19:09.765
Invitation to a job fair?

19:09.767 --> 19:11.600
When Powell RSVPed,
the trojan was installed.

19:11.602 --> 19:14.970
It opened a port on his computer
that allowed the hacker access.

19:14.972 --> 19:17.005
I'm now installing
that same trojan.

19:17.007 --> 19:19.508
You purposely infected
your own computer?

19:19.510 --> 19:21.644
No, I created a virtual system.

19:21.646 --> 19:24.012
Now the trojan can still run,
and we can see where it leads.

19:24.014 --> 19:26.615
- Back to the hacker.
- Yes.

19:26.617 --> 19:29.318
Wow.
The coding is so complex.

19:29.320 --> 19:31.036
It's really clever.

19:31.038 --> 19:34.073
But not clever enough--
We're connected.

19:34.075 --> 19:35.691
Can you get their location?

19:35.693 --> 19:37.209
No, the IP address is masked.

19:37.211 --> 19:39.695
But we can see
what they're looking at.

19:39.697 --> 19:42.381
Looks like a floor plan.

19:42.383 --> 19:44.166
Finch, that's
a federal courthouse downtown.

19:44.168 --> 19:45.801
Carter said
the FBI was now running

19:45.803 --> 19:47.703
the Powell investigation.

19:50.007 --> 19:51.223
If you really think
Powell is innocent

19:51.225 --> 19:53.258
you need to come up
with some evidence fast.

19:53.260 --> 19:55.427
- Is he still in your custody?
- He was.

19:55.429 --> 19:58.764
- The feds have him.
- Where are they taking him?

19:58.766 --> 20:01.216
The courthouse,
for arraignment tomorrow.

20:01.218 --> 20:04.103
- Why? What are you thinking?
- Thanks.

20:04.105 --> 20:05.721
The FBI's got Powell.

20:05.723 --> 20:07.523
They have no idea
they're dropping him off

20:07.525 --> 20:09.108
into the hands
of the assassins.

20:09.110 --> 20:11.777
What can I do?

20:11.779 --> 20:13.328
Send me the most direct route

20:13.330 --> 20:16.398
from the Eight Precinct
to the courthouse.

20:16.400 --> 20:19.034
I'm doing it now.

20:40.757 --> 20:42.274
Watch out!
Watch out!

21:09.587 --> 21:13.422
You're the guy who tackled me.
Who are you?

21:13.424 --> 21:15.624
One of the only people
who know you're innocent.

21:15.626 --> 21:16.759
What do you want?

21:16.761 --> 21:18.510
Right now,
to get you to someplace safe.

21:18.512 --> 21:19.595
Safe?

21:19.597 --> 21:21.480
You just kidnapped me
from the FBI.

21:21.482 --> 21:23.965
Go ahead, Finch.
I've got Powell.

21:23.967 --> 21:26.435
I haven't been able
to unmask the hacker's IP.

21:26.437 --> 21:30.739
But here's a vulnerability
in the firewall.

21:33.644 --> 21:36.111
Yes.

21:36.113 --> 21:39.281
Okay, now we're in.

21:39.283 --> 21:40.649
Never doubted you.

21:40.651 --> 21:43.418
Now let's see
who's behind the curtain.

21:45.873 --> 21:47.989
Wait, something's wrong.

21:47.991 --> 21:49.424
What is it?

21:49.426 --> 21:53.545
We didn't hack in,
we were let in.

21:53.547 --> 21:55.347
It's a honeypot.

21:59.018 --> 22:01.019
Program is sophisticated.

22:01.021 --> 22:02.354
They're using a worm

22:02.356 --> 22:05.724
to infect any devices connected
to our private network.

22:05.726 --> 22:07.843
Including our phones.

22:07.845 --> 22:09.177
They're listening to us
right now.

22:09.179 --> 22:11.063
- Destroy your phone.
- Wait.

22:11.065 --> 22:13.699
You know how to find me.

22:16.352 --> 22:18.620
Who are you?

23:13.420 --> 23:17.357
I'll take this one.

23:17.359 --> 23:19.525
Keep the change.

23:25.666 --> 23:33.623
212-555-0159.

23:39.214 --> 23:41.998
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.334
Here.
Put this on.

23:44.336 --> 23:49.505
You're the most wanted man
in New York.

23:53.311 --> 23:59.615
- 212-555-0159.

24:05.690 --> 24:07.407
Mr. Reese.

24:07.409 --> 24:09.158
Finch, what the hell happened?

24:09.160 --> 24:10.910
I'm afraid
I underestimated our hacker.

24:10.912 --> 24:12.445
As a consequence, my equipment

24:12.447 --> 24:13.529
at the library is compromised.

24:13.531 --> 24:15.581
So for the time being,
I'm mobile.

24:15.583 --> 24:17.633
Shhh!

24:21.121 --> 24:24.507
Listen, I felt like we
might need a little extra help

24:24.509 --> 24:26.492
looking for
congressman Delancey's killer,

24:26.494 --> 24:27.827
so I've called in a specialist--

24:27.829 --> 24:29.379
Someone with
an intimate knowledge

24:29.381 --> 24:32.164
of the political arena.
Oh, here she is.

24:32.166 --> 24:33.833
- I have to go.
- Wait a minute.

24:33.835 --> 24:35.518
Specialist? She?

24:35.520 --> 24:38.855
Finch?

24:48.817 --> 24:51.367
Hey, I reserved the room.

24:51.369 --> 24:54.987
Take a study break.

24:54.989 --> 24:57.206
Nice work, dude.

25:00.577 --> 25:02.027
Please.

25:02.029 --> 25:06.632
Thank you for meeting me on
such short notice, Ms. Morgan.

25:06.634 --> 25:08.217
I work when I'm needed, Mr.--

25:08.219 --> 25:10.136
Harold-- Please.

25:10.138 --> 25:14.540
I am curious
how you got my number.

25:14.542 --> 25:17.760
Mutual friend.
He assisted you on a...

25:17.762 --> 25:21.431
Delicate negotiation with a
certain pharmaceutical company.

25:21.433 --> 25:25.101
So you're the guy
on the other end of the phone.

25:25.103 --> 25:26.385
How is John?

25:26.387 --> 25:27.987
On the run, as usual.

25:27.989 --> 25:30.239
He's actually helping
another one of our clients

25:30.241 --> 25:31.524
even as we speak.

25:31.526 --> 25:34.911
And, in the same way that
he was able to assist you,

25:34.913 --> 25:40.199
we were hoping that you might
be able to return the favor.

25:42.419 --> 25:43.920
I don't understand.

25:43.922 --> 25:46.372
One man took my husband away
from all of you?

25:46.374 --> 25:48.174
We believe he's part
of an armed group--

25:48.176 --> 25:49.909
Possibly terrorists.

25:49.911 --> 25:53.096
Did your husband have any...

25:53.098 --> 25:55.214
Radical political views,
Mrs. Powell?

25:55.216 --> 25:56.682
Terrorists?
No.

25:56.684 --> 26:01.604
Scott would never be involved
in anything like that.

26:01.606 --> 26:03.923
If you don't believe me,
ask his friends, his coworkers.

26:03.925 --> 26:05.925
You do know that
your husband's been out of work

26:05.927 --> 26:07.276
for the past eight months?

26:07.278 --> 26:09.695
No. Scott goes to work
every day.

26:09.697 --> 26:14.233
Have you taken a look
at your finances recently?

26:17.621 --> 26:20.773
It seems pretty clear
that you don't know your husband

26:20.775 --> 26:24.043
as well as you think,
Mrs. Powell.

26:29.950 --> 26:31.116
Our client was

26:31.118 --> 26:32.835
at Congressman Delancey's
fundraiser.

26:32.837 --> 26:36.455
- As a guest?
- The shooter.

26:36.457 --> 26:37.757
He was framed.

26:37.759 --> 26:39.559
We're looking for
the actual shooter.

26:39.561 --> 26:42.595
Well, you boys certainly do
like a challenge, don't you?

26:42.597 --> 26:44.430
I've come up with a list
of alternative suspects--

26:44.432 --> 26:46.465
People who might have wanted
the Congressman dead.

26:46.467 --> 26:48.935
Well, all of these people have
been at each other's throats

26:48.937 --> 26:50.302
at some point.

26:50.304 --> 26:53.606
Whoever killed Delancey,
it goes way beyond politics.

26:53.608 --> 26:56.308
Prior to running for office,

26:56.310 --> 26:59.195
Delancey owned
a contracting company.

26:59.197 --> 27:02.698
DA's office has quietly been
preparing an investigation

27:02.700 --> 27:04.700
into the company
for several months.

27:04.702 --> 27:06.953
How do you know that?

27:06.955 --> 27:08.988
- Never mind.
- There were allegations

27:08.990 --> 27:11.507
of corner cutting and payoffs

27:11.509 --> 27:12.792
to city inspectors.

27:12.794 --> 27:14.510
Strange way for Delancey
to run his business,

27:14.512 --> 27:15.828
considering his
anti-corruption platform.

27:15.830 --> 27:16.879
It is.

27:16.881 --> 27:19.549
But he wasn't running
the business.

27:19.551 --> 27:22.518
Matheson--
Delancey's campaign manager.

27:22.520 --> 27:25.688
And business partner.

27:25.690 --> 27:27.172
For two years,

27:27.174 --> 27:29.174
Delancey is in
full-time campaign mode--

27:29.176 --> 27:32.344
Not really running
the day-to-day of his business.

27:32.346 --> 27:35.481
So the bribes
and the corner cutting--

27:35.483 --> 27:38.067
They must have happened
under Matheson's watch.

27:38.069 --> 27:43.289
Unless he could say Delancey
was really running things.

27:43.291 --> 27:45.791
Which he could if Delancey
wasn't around to defend himself.

27:45.793 --> 27:48.544
Even if this was true,

27:48.546 --> 27:52.732
we have no proof that
Matheson had Delancey killed.

27:52.734 --> 27:57.086
Let's go get some.

27:57.088 --> 27:58.871
Excuse me, sorry.

27:58.873 --> 28:00.089
Why'd your husband do this?

28:00.091 --> 28:01.874
I'm sorry.
Just-- just please.

28:01.876 --> 28:04.227
Did he really kill him?

28:06.763 --> 28:09.315
I don't get it.

28:09.317 --> 28:11.667
Why would anyone want
to do this to me?

28:14.438 --> 28:18.157
They needed a patsy.
And you fit the role.

28:18.159 --> 28:21.027
They?

28:21.029 --> 28:23.562
Who's they?

28:34.925 --> 28:36.792
Uhh!

28:52.926 --> 28:55.144
Come on.
Let's go!

29:03.870 --> 29:06.405
We're all feeling terrible...

29:06.407 --> 29:09.775
Just make sure that everybody
can stay as long as they want.

29:09.777 --> 29:11.460
I just got to get back
to the office, okay?

29:12.964 --> 29:14.964
Excuse me.

29:14.966 --> 29:17.416
- Mr. Matheson.
- Look, I'm sorry.

29:17.418 --> 29:19.669
- I've said everything--
- I'm not a reporter.

29:19.671 --> 29:21.337
My name is Zoe Morgan.

29:21.339 --> 29:23.956
I helped a friend of yours--
Jay Tanner-- Last year.

29:23.958 --> 29:26.342
Little matter
of a paternity suit.

29:26.344 --> 29:27.960
Oh, yes, well,
I'm sure we don't need

29:27.962 --> 29:29.345
those services right now,
thank you.

29:29.347 --> 29:31.597
Paternity suits
aren't my specialty.

29:31.599 --> 29:32.932
Crisis management is.

29:32.934 --> 29:36.335
And right now, I think
that's exactly what you need.

29:38.655 --> 29:39.689
All right.

29:39.691 --> 29:40.806
All right, Ms. Morgan,

29:40.808 --> 29:42.992
why don't you tell me
why I need <i>you.</i>

29:42.994 --> 29:45.695
One--
Your impending investigation

29:45.697 --> 29:47.079
with the DA's office.

29:47.081 --> 29:48.698
- I have lawyers on retainer.
- Two--

29:48.700 --> 29:49.982
The killing of your
business partner--

29:49.984 --> 29:52.501
Congressman Delancey.

29:52.503 --> 29:54.253
Excuse me?

29:54.255 --> 29:55.988
Delancey would have testified
that you were the one

29:55.990 --> 29:58.490
behind the shortcuts
and payoffs.

29:58.492 --> 30:01.961
Now that he's dead,
you can lay the blame on him.

30:01.963 --> 30:03.429
Who the hell
do you think you are?

30:03.431 --> 30:06.298
Your partner was going to burn
you, so you burned him first.

30:06.300 --> 30:08.333
I get it.
But your vendor?

30:08.335 --> 30:11.187
Your vendor dropped the ball.

30:11.189 --> 30:14.990
The man that you set up
is missing-in-action.

30:17.310 --> 30:19.695
You know, if you're going
to do something wrong,

30:19.697 --> 30:22.732
do it right.

30:22.734 --> 30:24.349
I can find Powell.

30:24.351 --> 30:27.853
Bring him to you
or whomever you like.

30:27.855 --> 30:29.121
For a price, of course.

30:29.123 --> 30:31.123
I don't know
what you're referring to.

30:31.125 --> 30:34.193
And I think it's time
that you leave.

30:34.195 --> 30:35.661
Keep the card.

30:35.663 --> 30:37.747
Might come in handy.

30:54.815 --> 30:56.882
I thought
I was clear on how this works--

30:56.884 --> 30:58.818
I call you,
not the other way around.

30:58.820 --> 31:01.520
I hired you because I thought
you could handle this.

31:01.522 --> 31:02.721
And I am.

31:02.723 --> 31:05.441
Then why is Powell still alive?

31:05.443 --> 31:08.060
You assured me
of your abilities.

31:08.062 --> 31:10.562
And right now,
I'm not seeing any of them.

31:10.564 --> 31:12.731
I could have
every email you've sent,

31:12.733 --> 31:15.534
contact you've called
and password you've used.

31:15.536 --> 31:16.786
I could empty
your bank accounts,

31:16.788 --> 31:18.704
liquidate your stocks,
and even send your ex-wife

31:18.706 --> 31:21.240
the location
of your house in Bermuda.

31:27.214 --> 31:29.682
All right, stop it, stop it.
You've made your point.

31:29.684 --> 31:31.550
Powell and his friend
will be taken care of.

31:31.552 --> 31:35.638
You just make sure
to have my final payment ready.

31:44.315 --> 31:45.481
Where are you?

31:45.483 --> 31:46.866
I'm headed downtown.

31:46.868 --> 31:48.200
The client's getting nervous.

31:48.202 --> 31:52.604
They just dropped
into the subway at 23rd and 8th.

31:52.606 --> 31:55.658
Got it.

32:05.952 --> 32:07.470
It's a transmitter.

32:07.472 --> 32:09.171
That's how the guy
at the hotel found us.

32:09.173 --> 32:11.457
Could have planted it today,

32:11.459 --> 32:14.059
maybe sometime earlier.

32:14.061 --> 32:16.479
Probably at your house.

32:16.481 --> 32:19.398
They've been to my house?

32:21.634 --> 32:24.103
Whoever is behind this
left little to chance.

32:24.105 --> 32:26.021
But I need you
to stay focused, Scott,

32:26.023 --> 32:28.274
so I can get you back
to your family.

32:28.276 --> 32:32.695
I doubt I got a family
to go back to right now.

32:32.697 --> 32:35.814
I know about your job.

32:35.816 --> 32:39.118
I know about the money,
the lies.

32:39.120 --> 32:42.421
Yeah, I know what it's like
to live inside a lie.

32:42.423 --> 32:43.706
I've lived there for so long,

32:43.708 --> 32:45.591
it feels like
there's no way out.

32:45.593 --> 32:49.128
But there always is.

32:51.464 --> 32:54.850
I just needed
a little more time, you know.

32:54.852 --> 32:59.605
To get a job,
to get on my feet.

32:59.607 --> 33:03.359
I was going to tell Leslie.

33:03.361 --> 33:05.694
But now it's too late.

33:05.696 --> 33:08.314
No, it's not.

33:08.316 --> 33:11.650
We're going to get you
out of this.

33:14.287 --> 33:16.655
These people...

33:16.657 --> 33:19.291
They killed a congressman.

33:19.293 --> 33:23.245
Are you going to promise me
that they won't kill us too?

33:26.833 --> 33:28.133
I didn't think so.

33:28.135 --> 33:30.135
I need to talk to my wife.
Now.

33:30.137 --> 33:32.221
That's not possible.
Not right now.

33:32.223 --> 33:33.389
We need to keep our heads down.

33:33.391 --> 33:35.140
I could die.

33:35.142 --> 33:40.512
And-- and the person
who I love most in life

33:40.514 --> 33:44.183
would think that
I'm nothing more than a killer.

33:44.185 --> 33:47.236
Do you have any idea
what that feels like?

33:49.406 --> 33:52.358
Actually, I do.

33:52.360 --> 33:54.726
Of course, in my case,

33:54.728 --> 33:57.580
it was true.

33:57.582 --> 33:59.248
Now, come on, let's go.

33:59.250 --> 34:02.668
Stand away from the door.

34:09.043 --> 34:10.376
Carter.

34:10.378 --> 34:11.594
Hello, Detective.

34:11.596 --> 34:13.295
What the hell
were you thinking...

34:13.297 --> 34:15.547
Taking down
a prisoner transfer?

34:15.549 --> 34:18.550
It worked.
Listen, I need a favor.

34:18.552 --> 34:20.469
Powell needs
to talk to his wife.

34:20.471 --> 34:22.855
- Now.
- Are you crazy?

34:22.857 --> 34:24.974
You know the feds
are up on her phone.

34:24.976 --> 34:27.559
He needs this, Carter.

34:37.786 --> 34:40.456
Mrs. Powell.

34:40.458 --> 34:42.157
Did you leave your kids
with your neighbor?

34:42.159 --> 34:43.442
Yes.
Is something wrong?

34:43.444 --> 34:46.295
No, uh, they're just calling
to check in.

34:48.130 --> 34:49.415
Follow me.

34:59.676 --> 35:01.093
Hello?

35:01.095 --> 35:03.128
Hi, Leslie.
Hi. It's me.

35:03.130 --> 35:05.564
Scott?
Where are you?

35:05.566 --> 35:07.900
I'm okay.
Listen...

35:07.902 --> 35:11.303
Leslie,
I'm really, really sorry.

35:11.305 --> 35:14.473
Oh, my God, Scott,
did you shoot that man?

35:14.475 --> 35:16.075
No, no, of course not.

35:16.077 --> 35:18.310
- You got to believe me, Les.
- Do I?

35:18.312 --> 35:21.146
You've been out of work
for eight months, Scott.

35:21.148 --> 35:23.082
What have you been doing
every morning?

35:23.084 --> 35:26.585
Looking for work--
Anywhere and everywhere.

35:26.587 --> 35:29.705
And our credit cards?
Our savings?

35:29.707 --> 35:32.374
I know, babe, I know.

35:32.376 --> 35:34.760
Why, Scott?

35:34.762 --> 35:37.596
Because I couldn't...

35:37.598 --> 35:41.316
I couldn't tell you
that I was fired.

35:43.186 --> 35:45.003
I thought
we told each other everything.

35:45.005 --> 35:48.673
I know.
Listen, Leslie,

35:48.675 --> 35:51.527
I'm going to make this right,
I promise.

35:56.182 --> 35:57.900
You can tell her
the rest in person.

35:57.902 --> 35:58.984
We need to move now.

35:58.986 --> 36:00.903
I gotta go.
I love you.

36:05.909 --> 36:07.593
Scott?

38:01.606 --> 38:03.524
Excuse me.
My name is Scott Powell.

38:03.526 --> 38:05.425
Stay where you are!
Do not turn around!

38:05.427 --> 38:07.978
Raise your hands!

38:11.149 --> 38:14.935
- Transport's waiting on us.
- You got it.

38:43.132 --> 38:44.648
Is it finished?

38:44.650 --> 38:46.850
Not quite.

38:46.852 --> 38:49.520
But I suspect it will be soon.

39:16.631 --> 39:18.115
I hired you

39:18.117 --> 39:20.117
because I thought
you could handle this.

39:20.119 --> 39:21.334
And I am.

39:21.336 --> 39:23.804
Then why is Powell still alive?

39:23.806 --> 39:25.389
You assured me
of your abilities.

39:25.391 --> 39:29.676
And right now,
I'm not seeing any of them.

39:52.533 --> 39:55.869
There he is!

39:57.088 --> 39:59.723
All right, folks,
get back, please.

39:59.725 --> 40:01.374
Sir--

40:01.376 --> 40:03.376
- Can you make a statement?
- Glad to be home, sir?

40:03.378 --> 40:06.730
Hey, Mr. Powell,
what's it like to be home, sir?

40:06.732 --> 40:09.600
- Glad to be home?
- Did you get any threats?

40:09.602 --> 40:11.351
What are you going to do
in reaction to this?

40:11.353 --> 40:15.572
- Zoe.
- John.

40:17.776 --> 40:20.994
I hear we have you to thank
for catching Matheson.

40:20.996 --> 40:22.896
Glad I could help.

40:22.898 --> 40:27.918
Although there is
a matter of payment.

40:27.920 --> 40:30.570
Buy me a drink?

40:30.572 --> 40:33.340
Did you miss your wife?

40:33.342 --> 40:36.009
- I did missed my wife.
- You once told me a story

40:36.011 --> 40:37.594
about a guy
who could say two words

40:37.596 --> 40:39.379
that would make
the reporters go away.

40:39.381 --> 40:42.249
Ever figure out what he said?

40:56.932 --> 40:59.432
I see that
Mr. Powell has been released.

40:59.434 --> 41:01.618
Still has a long road
ahead of him, though.

41:01.620 --> 41:03.770
Indeed.

41:03.772 --> 41:06.606
But I suspect that soon
he'll be on his way back.

41:06.608 --> 41:08.709
I control a company
that's decided

41:08.711 --> 41:10.610
to build a new facility
in New York.

41:10.612 --> 41:13.630
They could use a man like Powell
overseeing things.

41:13.632 --> 41:16.049
That's noble of you, Finch.

41:16.051 --> 41:19.253
Hardly. I just value
good people, Mr. Reese.

41:21.455 --> 41:23.957
You follow up on the hacker?

41:23.959 --> 41:27.895
She seems to cover her tracks
as efficiently as you do.

41:27.897 --> 41:31.732
I was able to trace the signal
to an address

41:31.734 --> 41:35.819
which the FBI received
by way of an...Anonymous tip.

41:35.821 --> 41:37.437
Sadly, they were too late.

41:37.439 --> 41:39.472
It seems the hacker
was using the dorm room

41:39.474 --> 41:41.575
of an unsuspecting
college student

41:41.577 --> 41:42.860
who had been on winter break.

41:42.862 --> 41:46.864
I need to determine the damage
to my system.

41:46.866 --> 41:49.616
I'll contact you
when another number comes up.

41:49.618 --> 41:51.368
Take care, Finch.

43:14.402 --> 43:18.055
"Next time."

43:41.553 --> 43:44.395
Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.
