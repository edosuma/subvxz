WEBVTT

01:53.915 --> 01:56.949
Ages and ages ago,

01:56.951 --> 02:00.185
in the time of our ancestors,

02:00.187 --> 02:04.322
the forces of evil
led by Shadower

02:04.324 --> 02:07.260
had subjugated almost
the entire world.

02:15.737 --> 02:18.370
The kingdom of Golan Mor,

02:18.372 --> 02:21.807
the last remaining
bulwark of civilization,

02:21.809 --> 02:25.178
was on the verge of
succumbing to evil's fury.

03:04.686 --> 03:06.453
My valiant warriors.

03:08.488 --> 03:11.489
Sire, shouldn't we be in battle?

03:11.491 --> 03:15.427
Hold onto your bold
enthusiasm my young Altar,

03:15.429 --> 03:18.498
there is a much more substantial
task that awaits you.

03:19.299 --> 03:20.835
And I did not want it.

03:21.836 --> 03:25.940
We are the last stronghold
of the Ancestral World.

03:27.575 --> 03:30.978
Shadawar spreads
death and destruction.

03:32.647 --> 03:35.315
One last effort is
all I ask of you.

03:36.551 --> 03:39.885
An extreme sacrifice to
slow down his advance

03:39.887 --> 03:42.289
to completion of the
Great Wizard spell.

03:43.356 --> 03:44.257
Don't worry, Sire.

03:46.027 --> 03:47.425
We are ready.

03:47.427 --> 03:48.261
No.

03:49.463 --> 03:52.767
You cannot imagine
what power he wields.

03:54.068 --> 03:57.337
I assure you it is
something beyond our means.

03:58.472 --> 04:00.608
All we can do is slow him down.

04:11.753 --> 04:12.653
He's coming.

04:38.980 --> 04:41.582
You treacherous son of a bitch!

04:43.050 --> 04:46.921
Your point of view is
limited, but I understand.

04:47.387 --> 04:48.488
We were at peace!

04:49.422 --> 04:52.091
All the kingdoms were at peace!

04:52.093 --> 04:53.391
Are you crazy?

04:53.393 --> 04:54.760
No, brother.

04:54.762 --> 04:56.361
It was not peace.

04:56.363 --> 04:59.532
It was a privileged
situation for us nobles.

04:59.534 --> 05:01.066
It was a stalemate.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.501
It was immobility.

05:02.503 --> 05:04.603
It was death.

05:04.605 --> 05:06.439
Things had to get started.

05:07.074 --> 05:09.043
And this is the solution?

05:09.911 --> 05:11.646
Complete destruction?

05:13.047 --> 05:14.445
Yes.

05:14.447 --> 05:17.082
While my King and
faithful friend strove

05:17.084 --> 05:20.085
to hold back Shadawar
on the battlefield,

05:20.087 --> 05:25.092
I, Melek, in those
last moments of my life

05:26.493 --> 05:30.031
was preparing to cast
my darkest spell.

05:35.636 --> 05:38.170
The King's valiant soldiers

05:38.172 --> 05:40.840
fought fiercely
to stop Shadawar.

05:52.119 --> 05:54.822
But all seemed to be lost.

06:23.184 --> 06:24.685
Is that all you have?

06:26.486 --> 06:27.989
You're not worthy.

06:28.923 --> 06:30.091
I am Shadawar!

06:35.796 --> 06:38.398
Hold fast, my King, hold fast!

06:39.399 --> 06:43.502
We are the Last Keepers
of the Ancestral World,

06:43.504 --> 06:47.942
and we will survive to
sing songs of this moment.

06:48.643 --> 06:49.176
Why?

06:51.078 --> 06:52.412
Why all this?

06:53.114 --> 06:54.513
Are you a fool?

06:54.515 --> 06:55.714
No!

06:55.716 --> 06:57.516
I'm the god of destruction!

06:57.518 --> 06:59.618
Melek!

06:59.620 --> 07:01.720
Here I am, my friend.

07:01.722 --> 07:04.424
This is for you!

07:16.604 --> 07:20.572
That day, Shadawar,
the god of destruction,

07:20.574 --> 07:22.908
and all his army,

07:22.910 --> 07:25.546
were defeated by my sacrifice.

07:27.281 --> 07:31.884
Golan Mor came at the head of
those who did not want to fall

07:31.886 --> 07:33.786
into the alliance of Shadawar.

07:37.091 --> 07:39.224
But war is terrible

07:39.226 --> 07:42.995
and even a great leader
cannot win forever,

07:42.997 --> 07:45.933
especially cannot conquer time.

07:47.234 --> 07:49.668
More and more tired,

07:49.670 --> 07:52.104
Golan Mor was waiting
for the moment

07:52.106 --> 07:55.808
when he passed the
command to his two sons,

07:55.810 --> 07:57.545
Iruma and Mairok.

07:59.613 --> 08:02.181
The two brothers
were valiant leaders,

08:02.183 --> 08:03.882
and under their leadership,

08:03.884 --> 08:08.255
the forces still loyal to
Shadawar suffered heavy defeats.

08:09.256 --> 08:12.624
The forces of chaos retreated.

08:12.626 --> 08:14.760
Peace was coming back.

09:51.425 --> 09:52.326
And you're done.

09:54.361 --> 09:57.062
Although, the enemy's not
gonna tell you the same.

09:57.064 --> 09:57.996
You're more than
likely gonna have

09:57.998 --> 09:59.665
a blade piercing your neck.

10:01.202 --> 10:02.970
I really thought
I was in trouble.

10:04.171 --> 10:06.105
You know what amazes me?

10:06.107 --> 10:07.306
Even after almost a
decade of fighting

10:07.308 --> 10:10.644
Shadawar's evil forces, you
still carry a tender heart.

10:11.779 --> 10:14.648
You know Mairok,
sometimes I just wish...

10:15.783 --> 10:16.984
I just wish you would...

10:18.385 --> 10:20.119
Be more like you, brother.

10:20.121 --> 10:20.888
No.

10:21.590 --> 10:22.623
I wish you wouldn't hesitate.

10:23.724 --> 10:25.324
Because when it comes time
to fight those evil forces,

10:25.326 --> 10:28.360
as you know, they are
not gonna show mercy,

10:28.362 --> 10:29.130
so why should you?

10:30.331 --> 10:32.431
All right, how about a rematch?

10:32.433 --> 10:33.667
Go.

11:06.967 --> 11:10.068
Mairok, are you okay?

11:10.070 --> 11:11.504
I think so.

11:12.773 --> 11:14.206
Iruma, behind you!

11:14.208 --> 11:15.073
- Mairok!
- Iruma, no!

11:15.075 --> 11:16.377
No, Iruma!

12:13.568 --> 12:14.802
Get up, my son.

12:20.307 --> 12:21.342
I'm sorry, Father.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.811
We <i>will</i> find your brother.

12:25.547 --> 12:26.814
Come with me.

12:34.488 --> 12:37.491
Atia, I believe you
have news for us.

12:37.958 --> 12:42.229
Yes, my king, but
you have to act immediately.

12:43.598 --> 12:45.264
Explain, Atia.

12:45.266 --> 12:48.066
Prince Iruma
is still alive

12:48.068 --> 12:51.506
but there is a reason that
he has not yet been killed.

12:53.207 --> 12:56.341
Our enemies have hidden
their intentions,

12:56.343 --> 12:59.878
which have been obscured
up to this point.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.116
I ask you forgiveness, sire.

13:03.585 --> 13:06.451
Don't ask me for forgiveness.

13:06.453 --> 13:07.988
I want to know what's going on.

13:08.757 --> 13:13.626
The forces of chaos are losing
the war with their weapons.

13:13.628 --> 13:16.596
That's why they decided
to use a descendant

13:16.598 --> 13:20.432
of the original ancestral
lineage of the world

13:20.434 --> 13:23.505
to use one of our
weapons against us.

13:24.438 --> 13:26.106
The Sacred Armor.

13:27.542 --> 13:30.210
But I thought the Sacred
Armor was just a legend.

13:31.045 --> 13:31.879
No, my son.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.515
It was used in a previous war,

13:35.517 --> 13:38.319
but considered too dangerous
by the Mother of All.

13:39.153 --> 13:41.887
It was then broken into
four different pieces,

13:41.889 --> 13:44.590
each of which was
entrusted to a Guardian.

13:44.592 --> 13:47.593
But now it is possible
that the forces of chaos

13:47.595 --> 13:50.962
will use Iruma to retrieve it.

13:50.964 --> 13:55.570
Iruma risks becoming a puppet
in the hands of our enemies.

13:58.105 --> 13:59.106
I will recover it.

14:00.508 --> 14:02.140
I will find it before they do

14:02.142 --> 14:04.443
and I will save Iruma.

14:04.445 --> 14:07.513
It will be very
difficult, Prince Mairok.

14:07.515 --> 14:11.149
If you move with an army,
or even a group of men,

14:11.151 --> 14:12.986
you risk being attacked.

14:14.488 --> 14:16.589
I know you have a spell

14:16.591 --> 14:20.562
that can make only one person
invisible to their magic.

14:23.997 --> 14:25.497
So I will go alone.

14:25.499 --> 14:26.333
Sire?

14:50.991 --> 14:51.626
Atia!

14:56.397 --> 14:57.231
I'm...

14:58.198 --> 14:59.099
I'm fine.

14:59.768 --> 15:02.604
The spell requires
a lot of energy.

15:08.610 --> 15:11.611
You will not feel
anything, but it worked.

15:11.613 --> 15:14.381
You will be invisible
to the enemies.

15:18.118 --> 15:20.954
I promise, Father, I
will bring Iruma home.

15:23.190 --> 15:24.224
I trust you, boy.

16:49.644 --> 16:50.645
Atia!

16:51.746 --> 16:53.144
Open the portal.

16:57.084 --> 16:57.785
Good luck, my son.

17:23.877 --> 17:25.112
Wow!

17:54.576 --> 17:57.242
Do you think I
don't trust my son?

17:57.244 --> 18:00.613
Monitoring him will
not be helpful.

18:00.615 --> 18:04.717
Indeed, this spell of
connection, though protected,

18:04.719 --> 18:07.789
could give our enemies
a way to re-trace us.

18:09.156 --> 18:10.190
We'll run the risk.

18:11.325 --> 18:13.795
I know he's the only one who
can complete the mission.

18:15.228 --> 18:16.363
I don't wanna lose him too.

18:34.247 --> 18:35.282
Vo' Segh ngo?

18:40.888 --> 18:43.589
Do you belong to
the ancient race?

18:43.591 --> 18:44.424
Yes.

18:46.794 --> 18:50.261
Are you here for
the Sacred Armor?

18:50.263 --> 18:50.798
Yes.

18:51.498 --> 18:55.202
I possess one of the four
stones that can summon one part,

18:56.671 --> 19:00.305
but this stone keeps
the balance of my lands.

19:00.307 --> 19:02.608
The entire Ancestral World

19:02.610 --> 19:04.277
is in danger of being destroyed.

19:05.345 --> 19:07.882
I need that stone in order
to keep that from happening.

19:08.650 --> 19:12.285
You had entrusted
this in our care.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.286
There's a war out there.

19:15.288 --> 19:16.822
I've seen it.

19:16.824 --> 19:17.659
I fought in it.

19:18.893 --> 19:21.493
You don't want this to
end badly for everyone,

19:21.495 --> 19:24.297
I beg you, please
give me that stone.

20:32.466 --> 20:35.333
And you would like to
save the Ancestral World

20:35.335 --> 20:36.804
from the forces of evil?

20:41.776 --> 20:43.609
You make me laugh.

20:43.611 --> 20:44.910
You're pathetic.

20:44.912 --> 20:47.247
I've tried to be patient
with you, splinter face.

20:53.353 --> 20:54.486
I am Mairok!

20:56.891 --> 20:58.023
Son of Golan Mor!

21:01.662 --> 21:04.364
I have fought on the
bastions of Orion!

21:05.833 --> 21:07.969
I have defeated the
armies of Shadawar!

21:08.836 --> 21:10.004
What do you know about me?

21:43.538 --> 21:44.870
He succeeded.

21:44.872 --> 21:48.406
Have confidence in
your son, my king.

21:48.408 --> 21:52.412
The time available is
short, but he will do it.

23:10.925 --> 23:12.558
Please.

23:12.560 --> 23:14.860
Do not force me to kill you!

23:16.764 --> 23:20.735
I am here to save the Ancestral
World and everyone in it!

23:24.238 --> 23:26.505
And that includes all of you.

24:40.047 --> 24:41.082
Sisters, get up.

24:58.733 --> 24:59.266
Warrior.

25:00.334 --> 25:02.503
Why disturb the
peace of my temple?

25:04.271 --> 25:05.671
It was not my intention.

25:05.673 --> 25:07.208
My sincerest apologies.

25:08.576 --> 25:09.577
Why are you here?

25:10.144 --> 25:12.044
To save the Ancestral World

25:12.046 --> 25:14.181
from that bastard
Shadawar's tyranny.

25:15.649 --> 25:16.617
Shadawar.

25:18.285 --> 25:19.086
Get up.

25:19.787 --> 25:21.255
Come inside and tell me more.

25:26.293 --> 25:27.828
But, my queen.

25:28.662 --> 25:29.864
Sister, quiet!

25:32.333 --> 25:34.199
I can understand perfectly well

25:34.201 --> 25:37.102
that this man has no
hostile intention.

25:37.104 --> 25:40.207
Therefore, I want to listen
to what he has to say.

25:41.142 --> 25:41.976
Free him!

26:27.788 --> 26:28.789
Where's the stone?

26:30.391 --> 26:32.326
The stone that evokes
the Sacred Armor?

26:33.694 --> 26:34.361
I have it.

26:35.729 --> 26:36.931
How do you know what that is?

26:38.365 --> 26:40.365
I thought by now the
memory of that stone

26:40.367 --> 26:41.902
would have been lost in time.

26:43.737 --> 26:44.903
How do you know?

26:44.905 --> 26:47.641
You're so... young.

26:48.142 --> 26:51.178
I am much older than you
can imagine, young one.

26:52.446 --> 26:55.116
So, what do they call you?

26:57.384 --> 27:00.686
I am Mairok, son of Golan Mor.

27:02.022 --> 27:03.657
A prince, of course.

27:05.392 --> 27:09.461
I am Lantris and I have
been here for many years

27:09.463 --> 27:11.396
without being able to grow old.

27:11.398 --> 27:13.200
Without being able to leave.

27:13.868 --> 27:16.070
And all because of that bastard.

27:22.042 --> 27:25.878
A long time ago,
Shadawar began to conquer

27:25.880 --> 27:29.014
the surrounding territories
of your father's kingdom.

27:29.016 --> 27:33.152
One by one, rulers devoted
themselves to his cause

27:33.154 --> 27:34.388
betraying Golan Mor.

27:35.956 --> 27:39.660
His evil reign reached
even as far as these lands.

27:41.028 --> 27:45.030
My Amazons and I resisted
as long as we could,

27:45.032 --> 27:47.500
but our efforts were futile

27:47.502 --> 27:49.401
and in our defeat

27:49.403 --> 27:50.371
Shadawar took over.

27:51.805 --> 27:53.506
He possessed one of the stones

27:53.508 --> 27:55.209
that could evoke
the Sacred Armor,

27:56.744 --> 27:59.444
and he used that
power against me,

27:59.446 --> 28:01.813
binding me to the stone forever.

28:01.815 --> 28:03.315
You fought with honor,

28:03.317 --> 28:07.085
and thus I'll spare the lives
of you and your Amazons.

28:07.087 --> 28:09.522
I'll be back when
the time is rights.

28:09.524 --> 28:12.257
Until then, you will be cursed

28:12.259 --> 28:14.126
to be the guardian of the stone!

28:14.128 --> 28:17.763
Over time, some of
the Shadawar's allies

28:17.765 --> 28:21.268
tried to overthrow him
and seize the stone.

28:23.003 --> 28:27.806
One of them managed
to mortally wound me

28:27.808 --> 28:29.410
or, so I thought.

28:30.778 --> 28:31.812
I did not die.

28:35.482 --> 28:37.049
After that,

28:37.051 --> 28:40.185
I met a clairvoyant named Atia.

28:40.187 --> 28:43.956
I sought her help to figure
out what had happened to me.

28:43.958 --> 28:48.829
Shadawar used the power of the
stone to make you immortal.

28:49.797 --> 28:52.798
And only through that same stone

28:52.800 --> 28:56.770
you can get back to being
an ordinary human being.

28:58.472 --> 29:01.840
She did everything in her
power to break the spell

29:01.842 --> 29:04.044
but Shadawar's curse
was too powerful.

29:12.353 --> 29:14.088
Only that one day

29:15.055 --> 29:20.060
a warrior will come who will
be able to break the spell.

29:22.830 --> 29:23.464
So,

29:24.566 --> 29:26.331
why should I care about saving

29:26.333 --> 29:28.469
this Ancestral World of yours?

29:30.070 --> 29:31.138
It's not just that.

29:32.607 --> 29:35.042
It is to save someone
very important to me.

29:37.177 --> 29:38.012
Tell me more.

29:43.951 --> 29:45.217
I don't have much time before

29:45.219 --> 29:47.886
my brother becomes a
puppet in their hands.

29:47.888 --> 29:49.087
With that armor...

29:49.089 --> 29:50.889
they can destroy the
entire Ancestral World

29:50.891 --> 29:51.825
and everyone in it.

29:52.893 --> 29:54.228
And that includes your Amazons.

30:01.869 --> 30:02.537
I understand.

30:04.539 --> 30:06.204
And I will help you

30:06.206 --> 30:10.010
but I cannot give you the
stone, so I will go with you.

30:11.178 --> 30:12.545
No.

30:12.547 --> 30:14.012
It's something I
must do on my own.

30:14.014 --> 30:15.648
Don't be a fool, Mairok.

30:15.650 --> 30:17.182
I'm immortal

30:17.184 --> 30:20.454
and an ally that cannot
die may be very beneficial.

30:22.356 --> 30:23.525
I don't know what to say.

30:26.327 --> 30:27.428
How about goodnight?

31:02.162 --> 31:02.996
Lantris!

31:05.499 --> 31:06.501
Who are you?

31:08.703 --> 31:10.168
Did Shadawar send you?

31:10.170 --> 31:11.438
What have you done with Lantris?

32:25.112 --> 32:26.779
Lantris!

32:26.781 --> 32:27.582
No, no, no, no, no, no.

32:30.484 --> 32:31.684
I didn't mean to.

32:31.686 --> 32:32.687
I didn't mean to.

32:34.789 --> 32:37.757
Lantris, I didn't mean to.

32:46.601 --> 32:48.068
I thought you were the one.

32:50.572 --> 32:53.071
I did not die, I will never die!

32:53.073 --> 32:56.074
My family, my friends,
they've all disappeared

32:56.076 --> 32:58.412
and I will stay like
this, alone forever.

33:01.148 --> 33:01.716
Forgive me.

33:03.050 --> 33:04.485
Forgive me, Mairok.

33:08.756 --> 33:10.324
I really thought
you were the one.

33:16.129 --> 33:18.698
I knew I couldn't
convince you to kill me.

33:18.700 --> 33:19.534
I'm sorry.

33:22.102 --> 33:22.737
I'm sorry.

33:50.598 --> 33:51.431
Wait here.

34:00.875 --> 34:02.042
Sisters, get up.

34:03.878 --> 34:06.344
I've decided to join
the prince's journey.

34:06.346 --> 34:08.112
But, my queen!

34:08.114 --> 34:09.815
My duty is to guard the stone.

34:09.817 --> 34:12.484
Wherever the stone
goes, I'll go with it

34:12.485 --> 34:14.119
and maybe on this
trip I'll find a way

34:14.121 --> 34:15.822
to break the spell
that had cursed me.

34:16.891 --> 34:19.291
Okay, but we come with you.

34:19.293 --> 34:20.458
No.

34:20.460 --> 34:22.193
The prince is
protected by a spell

34:22.195 --> 34:24.362
that makes him invisible
to his enemies,

34:24.364 --> 34:27.134
and even this curse allows
me to be invisible as well.

34:28.402 --> 34:29.502
But...

34:29.504 --> 34:31.335
I need you here.

34:50.324 --> 34:52.324
My king.

34:52.326 --> 34:53.826
Well, Atia?

34:53.828 --> 34:58.330
The prince was able
to recover the second stone.

34:58.332 --> 35:00.165
So,

35:00.167 --> 35:01.769
everything is
going as it should.

35:03.170 --> 35:04.804
Maybe there is a hope.

35:04.806 --> 35:06.739
I'm sure, my lord.

35:06.741 --> 35:11.176
And now your son is also
being helped by someone.

35:11.178 --> 35:11.813
What?

35:13.514 --> 35:15.548
The mission has been discovered?

35:15.550 --> 35:16.882
No, my lord,

35:16.884 --> 35:21.219
this is someone that I
have known a long time ago.

35:21.221 --> 35:23.221
Mairok, are you okay?

35:24.458 --> 35:25.827
Maybe we should slow down.

35:27.729 --> 35:28.830
You don't understand!

35:29.897 --> 35:30.898
We don't have time!

35:32.867 --> 35:36.502
If even one of the stones falls
in the hands of our enemies,

35:36.504 --> 35:39.172
my brother and the
entire Ancestral World

35:40.875 --> 35:41.709
are doomed!

35:46.981 --> 35:47.815
Mairok!

36:04.431 --> 36:05.731
Mairok.

36:05.733 --> 36:07.332
What happened?

36:07.334 --> 36:09.234
The vital signs of Mairok.

36:09.236 --> 36:11.269
What happened to him?

36:11.271 --> 36:12.738
- Is...
- No,

36:12.740 --> 36:13.641
not dead.

36:14.909 --> 36:17.643
But they are very weak.

36:17.645 --> 36:18.846
Wounded in combat?

36:20.347 --> 36:22.782
Was he betrayed by that
person you told me about?

36:22.784 --> 36:24.850
No, my lord.

36:24.852 --> 36:27.620
Your son is...

36:27.622 --> 36:28.554
An idiot!

36:28.556 --> 36:30.288
What a complete idiot.

36:30.290 --> 36:32.692
I've never met someone
so devoted to his cause

36:32.694 --> 36:33.895
to risk his own life for it.

36:34.962 --> 36:36.196
Lantris.

36:37.699 --> 36:38.931
What happened?

36:38.933 --> 36:39.901
You fell unconscious.

36:41.468 --> 36:43.468
Now could you
please explain to me

36:43.470 --> 36:45.270
why you kept hidden the wound

36:45.272 --> 36:47.207
that I caused you
during our fight?

36:50.712 --> 36:54.481
You really are an idiot, Prince
Mairok, son of Golan Mor.

37:09.362 --> 37:10.328
Ah.

37:10.330 --> 37:10.965
Careful.

37:14.602 --> 37:15.435
Better.

37:20.307 --> 37:20.942
Get some rest.

37:21.909 --> 37:23.477
The stone should help you heal.

37:24.377 --> 37:25.012
Yeah.

37:26.480 --> 37:27.378
What about you?

37:27.380 --> 37:28.482
You must be exhausted.

37:29.316 --> 37:31.382
Since I've been given
this curse, Mairok,

37:31.384 --> 37:35.757
I do not feel the need to
rest, nor drink, nor eat, nor...

38:41.388 --> 38:41.987
What's wrong?

38:41.989 --> 38:42.790
What are you thinking?

38:47.795 --> 38:50.763
Many men wish for immortality.

38:50.765 --> 38:53.766
But if they really knew what
it meant to be immortal,

38:53.768 --> 38:55.703
I'm sure they would
change their minds.

39:01.776 --> 39:02.610
Oh, look.

40:31.599 --> 40:32.767
Look, there.

40:57.558 --> 40:58.958
It seems too damn easy.

40:58.960 --> 40:59.760
I agree.

41:00.194 --> 41:02.194
That's why I will try
to take the stone.

41:02.196 --> 41:03.529
But...

41:03.531 --> 41:04.665
Mairok, use your head.

41:05.733 --> 41:07.700
Right, you're invincible.

41:07.702 --> 41:08.803
That's right.

41:30.057 --> 41:30.791
Lantris!

41:35.296 --> 41:36.630
Don't worry about me.

41:39.133 --> 41:41.569
What are you
do in my reign?

41:42.636 --> 41:44.236
Guardian!

41:44.238 --> 41:45.539
Show yourself!

41:47.608 --> 41:49.677
We're not here to fight,
we just need your help.

41:51.212 --> 41:52.146
Guardian!

41:53.214 --> 41:56.217
Prove to me you
are worthy of your first name.

41:58.652 --> 41:59.820
Free Lantris!

42:02.356 --> 42:03.591
Or what?

42:04.725 --> 42:05.726
All right, then...

42:11.999 --> 42:13.599
Do you
really want to generate

42:13.601 --> 42:16.103
the wave of energy that
could destroy this temple?

42:17.104 --> 42:18.170
Why not?

42:18.172 --> 42:20.875
That way you won't be able
to hide like a coward.

42:21.742 --> 42:23.911
And if
I were to kill her?

42:26.113 --> 42:27.312
That's impossible.

42:27.314 --> 42:28.149
She's immortal.

42:29.350 --> 42:30.551
Really?

42:34.255 --> 42:35.990
You're just trying
to confuse me!

42:40.795 --> 42:43.328
She said she wants to
get rid of the curse,

42:43.330 --> 42:45.030
but not die right away.

42:45.032 --> 42:46.265
Shut up.

42:46.267 --> 42:48.734
And if now
that she has known you,

42:48.736 --> 42:50.771
she no longer wishes to die?

42:53.274 --> 42:54.306
Shut up!

42:54.308 --> 42:55.309
And you!

42:56.277 --> 42:59.378
Everyone would see that
you're madly in love with her.

42:59.380 --> 43:03.117
You would not want to see her
die, right, Prince Mairok?

43:10.724 --> 43:12.226
You can do better than that.

43:14.962 --> 43:15.996
I'll be right back.

43:30.911 --> 43:31.745
Show yourself!

43:51.732 --> 43:53.033
How about you try that again?

43:55.570 --> 43:57.037
How is this possible?

43:58.739 --> 44:00.205
I can see you now.

44:28.369 --> 44:30.802
It's the connection
between the stones.

44:30.804 --> 44:32.006
I can sense your energy.

44:32.907 --> 44:34.308
Prepare to die.

45:16.050 --> 45:17.384
I'm sorry, guardian.

45:20.387 --> 45:22.122
This is not how I
wanted it to end.

45:23.558 --> 45:24.925
Now, free Lantris.

45:25.859 --> 45:27.259
Don't worry.

45:27.261 --> 45:29.962
Your time will come soon enough.

45:29.964 --> 45:32.164
Soon you will all die,

45:32.166 --> 45:34.502
Prince Mairok, son of Golan Mor.

45:35.369 --> 45:36.835
How do you know me?

45:36.837 --> 45:40.506
I was created to protect
the stone from Shadawar

45:40.508 --> 45:42.874
and he's making his return.

45:42.876 --> 45:44.577
You've been here for too long.

45:44.579 --> 45:46.078
Shadawar is dead.

45:46.080 --> 45:48.415
Melek defeated him with
a spell 10 years ago.

45:49.316 --> 45:52.351
All that actually died
was his physical form,

45:52.353 --> 45:54.853
not his soul, which lived on.

45:54.855 --> 45:57.258
He still commands
the dark forces...

45:57.825 --> 46:00.826
and now has a new physical form,

46:00.828 --> 46:03.295
a body from the ancestral race,

46:03.297 --> 46:06.131
and once he finds
that Sacred Armor,

46:06.133 --> 46:08.068
then nothing will
be able to stop him.

46:11.305 --> 46:12.237
Mairok!

46:12.239 --> 46:13.171
Lantris!

46:14.875 --> 46:16.308
My brother,

46:16.310 --> 46:18.045
the host body for Shadawar.

46:21.583 --> 46:22.783
Look,

46:23.752 --> 46:26.351
I'm not going to tell you
I know what you're feeling

46:26.353 --> 46:28.588
but don't lose control.

46:28.590 --> 46:30.623
You already have
three of the stones.

46:30.625 --> 46:31.792
Only one is left.

46:33.227 --> 46:34.194
We'll make it in time.

46:34.928 --> 46:35.462
We will.

46:37.398 --> 46:38.499
What do we do about him?

46:39.867 --> 46:41.503
There's nothing
you can do for me.

46:42.936 --> 46:45.871
I'm going back into the shadows

46:45.873 --> 46:47.107
where I've always been.

46:48.510 --> 46:50.275
But beware,

46:50.277 --> 46:53.278
because Shadawar is coming back!

46:53.280 --> 46:57.015
And the Ancestral World will
enter an age of darkness

46:57.017 --> 46:59.151
it has never seen before.

47:11.365 --> 47:12.532
He did it.

47:12.534 --> 47:13.965
Yes, my king,

47:13.967 --> 47:18.403
and every stone and each
test makes him stronger,

47:18.405 --> 47:20.575
increases his powers.

47:21.108 --> 47:23.110
There is only one stone left.

47:24.378 --> 47:26.579
What do you see in the future?

47:26.581 --> 47:29.281
Maybe he really will succeed
in saving his brother.

47:29.283 --> 47:32.150
He has already
demonstrated many times

47:32.152 --> 47:34.920
his value in battle.

47:34.922 --> 47:37.989
Why do you doubt
Mairok, my liege?

47:37.991 --> 47:39.659
Mairok has always
lived in the shadow

47:39.661 --> 47:41.228
of his older brother Iruma.

47:43.297 --> 47:46.066
I thought he was a poor
imitation of his older brother.

47:47.535 --> 47:48.503
I was wrong.

47:50.337 --> 47:53.305
He's a worthy son
and a great warrior.

47:53.307 --> 47:55.541
He has a pure heart.

47:55.543 --> 48:00.548
And the man who can accomplish
this task is a man like him.

48:01.716 --> 48:04.216
A man who deeply
loves his brother.

48:04.218 --> 48:09.223
A man who believes in something
for which is worth fighting.

49:38.580 --> 49:39.313
There it is.

49:40.080 --> 49:41.379
We're almost there.

49:41.381 --> 49:43.348
We will find your brother.

49:43.350 --> 49:44.351
I know.

49:44.786 --> 49:45.986
I know!

49:46.588 --> 49:49.589
You are not alone,
remember this.

49:59.333 --> 50:00.232
Lantris, I...

50:00.234 --> 50:02.200
Whatever nonsense
you're about to say,

50:02.202 --> 50:05.072
just wait until we've
recovered the last stone.

50:06.373 --> 50:07.107
Right.

50:08.108 --> 50:08.643
Let's go.

51:08.468 --> 51:09.537
Look there.

51:30.257 --> 51:31.691
Go find the stone.

51:31.693 --> 51:33.093
I'll take care of this.

51:33.561 --> 51:34.394
Right.

53:06.587 --> 53:07.421
Welcome.

53:15.697 --> 53:17.362
I just need the stone.

53:17.364 --> 53:18.198
I don't wanna fight.

53:32.613 --> 53:34.682
Oh well, twice the fun.

56:16.611 --> 56:17.645
Yes.

56:54.882 --> 56:56.215
Oh, come on.

57:00.254 --> 57:01.088
Mairok?

57:02.023 --> 57:02.957
A little help?

57:12.633 --> 57:14.735
Perhaps you could
be a hero after all.

57:16.170 --> 57:16.969
Perhaps.

57:16.971 --> 57:18.804
Did you get the stone?

57:18.806 --> 57:19.874
Of course I did.

57:28.215 --> 57:31.152
My king, he did it.

57:31.752 --> 57:33.187
Sorry to have
doubted you, my son.

58:14.161 --> 58:16.764
Lantris, where is your stone?

58:48.896 --> 58:51.864
Is that supposed to happen?

58:51.866 --> 58:53.734
I have no idea!

58:55.002 --> 58:57.002
I was just trying to
prevent someone else

58:57.004 --> 58:58.839
from evoking the Sacred Armor!

59:00.307 --> 59:01.675
It is not possible.

59:03.377 --> 59:04.845
What is not possible?

59:06.247 --> 59:07.248
Atia, tell me.

59:07.982 --> 59:10.749
When the four stones
came together,

59:10.751 --> 59:13.385
their joint power
swept away the magic.

59:13.387 --> 59:14.555
What do you mean?

59:15.356 --> 59:16.488
Explain yourself!

59:16.490 --> 59:21.126
That now Mairok is visible
to the forces of Shadawar.

59:21.128 --> 59:22.861
Do something!

59:22.863 --> 59:24.265
Warn him of the danger he is in!

59:24.932 --> 59:27.900
My powers are not strong enough.

59:27.902 --> 59:30.869
I can't reach it with my mind.

59:30.871 --> 59:35.576
Now Mairok is alone.

59:37.878 --> 59:39.647
The Sacred Armor.

59:42.783 --> 59:43.882
Mairok, what's that?

59:43.884 --> 59:44.752
Stay back!

59:46.687 --> 59:48.322
That's the same
portal my brother...

59:49.890 --> 59:51.192
My brother, Iruma!

59:53.727 --> 59:55.629
Mairok, watch out!

59:56.397 --> 59:59.064
Remember what the
Shadow told you!

01:00:01.368 --> 01:00:02.203
Iruma!

01:00:03.671 --> 01:00:04.903
Brother!

01:00:04.905 --> 01:00:05.739
Brother.

01:00:09.276 --> 01:00:12.311
I was imprisoned by
Shadawar's forces.

01:00:12.313 --> 01:00:14.413
They had me imprisoned until
someone gathered the stones

01:00:14.415 --> 01:00:15.916
to evoke the Sacred Armor.

01:00:17.718 --> 01:00:18.352
Iruma.

01:00:33.067 --> 01:00:35.868
Your weak-minded brother
tried to stop me.

01:00:35.870 --> 01:00:39.037
Little did he know,
nothing can stop Shadawar!

01:00:39.039 --> 01:00:40.472
Not even death!

01:00:44.478 --> 01:00:46.011
No!

01:01:53.847 --> 01:01:55.716
You would have been
better off staying dead.

01:02:01.055 --> 01:02:02.356
You want to fight me?

01:02:03.290 --> 01:02:04.959
You really are an idiot.

01:02:05.993 --> 01:02:06.827
Yeah, maybe,

01:02:08.362 --> 01:02:10.329
but don't underestimate
this idiot.

01:02:18.472 --> 01:02:19.306
Iruma!

01:02:20.508 --> 01:02:21.308
Brother!

01:02:23.244 --> 01:02:26.413
Please, tell me a part of
you is still inside there!

01:02:27.515 --> 01:02:28.916
Mairok, please.

01:02:42.363 --> 01:02:43.895
It's too easy...

01:02:43.897 --> 01:02:44.932
...brother.

01:02:49.336 --> 01:02:51.236
<i>I wish
you wouldn't hesitate</i>

01:02:51.238 --> 01:02:53.872
<i>because when it comes time
to fight those evil forces,</i>

01:02:53.874 --> 01:02:55.541
<i>they are not going
to show mercy.</i>

01:02:55.543 --> 01:02:56.875
<i>So why should you?</i>

01:03:57.371 --> 01:03:59.971
Time to die, sweet prince.

01:03:59.973 --> 01:04:01.942
And next up, your beloved king.

01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:07.647
Iruma,

01:04:07.649 --> 01:04:10.248
Father, forgive me.

01:04:12.386 --> 01:04:13.220
No!

01:05:11.478 --> 01:05:14.379
I'm sorry, my king.

01:05:14.381 --> 01:05:16.682
Everything is lost.

01:05:16.684 --> 01:05:17.519
Mairok.

01:05:19.119 --> 01:05:19.953
Iruma.

01:05:21.455 --> 01:05:22.289
Shadawar!

01:05:24.992 --> 01:05:27.025
How is this possible?

01:05:27.027 --> 01:05:28.761
I swore I'd return, Golan Mor.

01:05:28.763 --> 01:05:29.997
Atia!

01:05:30.698 --> 01:05:32.232
Call the guards!

01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:36.736
I fear she is so
overwhelmed with emotion

01:05:36.738 --> 01:05:39.106
to be able to find her words.

01:05:41.074 --> 01:05:43.310
What happened to my sons?

01:05:44.111 --> 01:05:46.779
Your children are all
dead, my dear king.

01:05:50.384 --> 01:05:51.952
And now it's your turn.

01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:57.022
The era of the Ancestral
World ends here.

01:05:57.024 --> 01:05:59.725
This is the rise of my kingdom.

01:05:59.727 --> 01:06:02.394
The beginning of chaos!

01:06:02.396 --> 01:06:07.401
However, this isn't the
right stage for my triumph.

01:06:13.207 --> 01:06:14.141
Come, King.

01:06:15.209 --> 01:06:16.511
It's time to die.

01:06:18.813 --> 01:06:22.316
This time, no one and
nothing will be saving you.

01:06:34.228 --> 01:06:35.062
Mairok!

01:06:36.798 --> 01:06:38.031
Mairok!

01:06:39.734 --> 01:06:40.600
Mairok!

01:06:42.770 --> 01:06:43.836
Mairok!

01:06:43.838 --> 01:06:45.138
Mairok?

01:06:45.673 --> 01:06:46.508
Mairok.

01:06:48.408 --> 01:06:49.243
Lantris.

01:06:50.812 --> 01:06:52.444
You're right.

01:06:52.446 --> 01:06:53.445
I really am an idiot.

01:06:53.447 --> 01:06:54.346
No.

01:06:58.385 --> 01:06:59.219
Mairok.

01:07:00.354 --> 01:07:02.657
Mairok, stay with me.

01:07:03.525 --> 01:07:05.490
Mairok, don't!

01:07:05.492 --> 01:07:07.158
Mairok, please don't!

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:08.493
Mairok!

01:07:08.495 --> 01:07:10.130
Please don't leave me, Mairok!

01:08:10.758 --> 01:08:14.492
The era of the Ancestral
World ends here.

01:08:14.494 --> 01:08:16.162
You are a fool, Shadawar.

01:08:16.764 --> 01:08:20.165
You may kill me, but
you will never win.

01:08:26.908 --> 01:08:29.376
Please.

01:08:42.724 --> 01:08:45.459
When you placed the last stone,

01:08:47.962 --> 01:08:49.863
I could feel the spell breaking.

01:08:52.466 --> 01:08:54.636
I haven't yet turned
back into a mortal

01:08:56.904 --> 01:08:59.237
but I can now fully control

01:08:59.238 --> 01:09:00.841
the energy that
makes me immortal.

01:09:13.921 --> 01:09:15.988
What happened?

01:09:15.990 --> 01:09:18.591
Don't worry about it.

01:09:22.496 --> 01:09:25.198
I finally realized
what my purpose is.

01:09:27.434 --> 01:09:29.770
You are the warrior
I was waiting for.

01:09:32.607 --> 01:09:34.174
I love you, Mairok.

01:09:35.408 --> 01:09:36.742
No.

01:09:36.743 --> 01:09:38.511
Don't do this.

01:09:38.513 --> 01:09:40.682
My life is worth nothing
compared to yours.

01:09:41.948 --> 01:09:43.951
I lived centuries, Mairok.

01:09:46.754 --> 01:09:49.756
But I've never felt truly
alive until I met you.

01:09:54.361 --> 01:09:55.195
Lantris.

01:09:55.997 --> 01:09:57.429
Lantris!

01:09:57.431 --> 01:09:59.701
An important destiny
awaits you, young God.

01:10:02.402 --> 01:10:04.670
Go.

01:10:04.672 --> 01:10:05.973
Save your kingdom.

01:10:09.510 --> 01:10:10.343
Lantris.

01:10:15.049 --> 01:10:17.482
I'll come back, my love.

01:11:30.992 --> 01:11:32.591
Shadawar!

01:11:32.593 --> 01:11:35.027
You will pay for what
you've done to me!

01:11:35.029 --> 01:11:36.796
You're still alive?

01:11:36.798 --> 01:11:38.065
That damned immortal.

01:11:39.399 --> 01:11:40.835
I should have killed you both.

01:12:03.524 --> 01:12:05.860
You don't want to understand.

01:12:07.394 --> 01:12:10.330
This is the Sacred Armor!

01:12:22.009 --> 01:12:24.411
Should this little
scene impress me?

01:12:29.449 --> 01:12:31.351
It's the Sacred Armor, Shadawar.

01:12:32.119 --> 01:12:33.588
Exactly like yours.

01:12:35.957 --> 01:12:37.558
<i>Perhaps
even more powerful.</i>

01:12:38.125 --> 01:12:40.159
<i>You see, the armor is a concept,</i>

01:12:40.161 --> 01:12:42.561
<i>created long ago to store
a large amount of energy</i>

01:12:42.563 --> 01:12:44.096
<i>in physical form.</i>

01:12:44.098 --> 01:12:47.066
<i>What you wear is simply a
container of that energy.</i>

01:12:47.068 --> 01:12:48.500
<i>And the stones that evoke it</i>

01:12:48.502 --> 01:12:50.137
<i>are only one means
to harness it.</i>

01:12:51.138 --> 01:12:54.840
<i>These arm guards given
to me by my father.</i>

01:12:54.842 --> 01:12:57.076
<i>I created a bond
with that energy</i>

01:12:57.078 --> 01:12:58.777
<i>and I'm now powerful
enough to evoke</i>

01:12:58.779 --> 01:13:00.413
<i>a sacred armor of my own!</i>

01:14:54.829 --> 01:14:58.263
Only through
sacrifice and loss,

01:14:58.265 --> 01:15:02.536
a prince learns how
to become a king.

01:15:03.571 --> 01:15:04.505
And so...

01:15:05.172 --> 01:15:09.543
a new history of
the Ancestral World began.

01:15:10.644 --> 01:15:13.247
But this is another story.
