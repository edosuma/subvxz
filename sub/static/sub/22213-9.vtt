Dawson Pitt?

00:03.837 --> 00:04.772
Yeah.

00:04.872 --> 00:08.376
(grunting)

00:08.476 --> 00:11.212
He puts the San Francisco Police
on me, I'm not gonna make it.

00:11.312 --> 00:13.447
If it's between holding out
or prison,

00:13.547 --> 00:16.184
eventually I'm gonna tell them
whatever they want to know.

00:16.284 --> 00:18.086
And I can't
leave my daughter.

00:18.186 --> 00:20.188
Just because you're not
going to juvenile hall

00:20.288 --> 00:22.356
doesn't mean we can go back
to the way things were.

00:22.456 --> 00:23.291
Mom, Help me!

00:23.391 --> 00:25.393
You have to trust me!

00:25.959 --> 00:28.862
-Mom, please, no!
-(Crying)

00:28.962 --> 00:29.863
You ran away?

LEXI: Got all the way
to the Colony,

00:31.299 --> 00:32.966
the squatter house
in Oakland.

Bullshit-free living.

I have to leave soon.

00:35.969 --> 00:37.571
D: This guy who's
looking for you.

00:37.671 --> 00:41.109
Hector Ibarra.
He wants the baby.

00:41.209 --> 00:42.643
I can take care
of Hector.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.378
I know that
you think that you can.

00:44.478 --> 00:47.415
You can't stop it, and so you
better not get in the way of it.

00:47.515 --> 00:51.552
No more talking to Dr. Chance.
That is over.

00:51.652 --> 00:53.787
D: Lambert took care of him
like a boss.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.557
He was murdered so he couldn't
dump Lambert in the shit.

00:56.657 --> 00:58.326
CHANCE:
It was Stevie Benjamin.

00:58.426 --> 01:00.060
The DNA from under
his fingernails

01:00.161 --> 01:02.330
will match the DNA
on this fork.

01:02.430 --> 01:03.831
If it's a match,
I'll tell you the name then.

01:03.931 --> 01:06.934
DET. LACEY: Dr. Chance?
Can we talk to you, please?

01:07.034 --> 01:07.968
Talk to me about what?

01:08.068 --> 01:09.670
The aggravated assault
and battery

01:09.770 --> 01:11.605
of a man named Dawson Pitt.

02:05.793 --> 02:08.696
I need both your thumbs
at the same time.

02:08.796 --> 02:11.699
Just relax your hands.

02:11.799 --> 02:14.335
Now your right four fingers.

02:14.435 --> 02:17.305
I'm gonna roll them all
individually for you, sir, okay?

02:17.405 --> 02:19.307
I -- Yeah, yeah, okay.

02:19.407 --> 02:22.142
DET. LACEY: We showed Mr. Pitt
what we call a six-pack --

02:22.243 --> 02:25.078
six photographs of people
all the same race,

02:25.179 --> 02:27.748
age, height,
coloring, characteristics.

02:27.848 --> 02:30.184
We asked him to point out
if the man who attacked him

02:30.284 --> 02:34.222
was one of the six,
and he picked you.

02:34.322 --> 02:36.757
Had you ever met Mr. Pitt
before that night?

02:38.659 --> 02:41.995
How will I know when my lawyer
gets here?

02:42.095 --> 02:43.231
Will he show up
to this room,

02:43.331 --> 02:45.065
or will they pretend
they don't know where I am

02:45.165 --> 02:47.201
until you're done
with your questions?

02:49.903 --> 02:52.105
Going to take you to booking
now, sir, all right?

02:52.206 --> 02:53.941
When your lawyer shows up,
I'm gonna have the desk sergeant

02:54.041 --> 02:55.376
tell them
to meet us down there.

02:55.476 --> 02:57.711
-All right.
-Come on with me, this way.

Your call has been forwarded

03:08.121 --> 03:08.956
(beep)

03:09.923 --> 03:12.092
Hi, it's me.
If you ever check your messages,

03:12.192 --> 03:15.929
you probably know by now
that I left that fucking place.

03:16.029 --> 03:19.767
And if that's
what you thought --

03:19.867 --> 03:21.068
if that's what you thought
would help me,

03:21.168 --> 03:23.136
well, you're wrong.

03:23.237 --> 03:24.938
I have a place to stay
for a while,

03:25.038 --> 03:26.740
and this isn't my number.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.376
The camp has my phone.

03:28.476 --> 03:30.244
And maybe that's a good thing,
'cause right now,

03:30.344 --> 03:33.247
I really don't want to
talk to you, Dad.

03:33.347 --> 03:36.116
But I just -- I thought you
should know I'm okay.

Uh, I'm good.

You awake, pendejo?

Huh?

04:36.644 --> 04:38.346
The fuck were you thinking?

04:38.446 --> 04:42.115
You say you know where she is,
and then not tell?

04:43.551 --> 04:45.319
(breathing heavily)

04:49.790 --> 04:53.193
Fuck it, man. He's out.
I need a smoke.

04:53.293 --> 04:56.630
Don't go anywhere.

04:56.730 --> 04:59.333
Chico, keep an eye
on this fucker.

04:59.433 --> 05:01.569
He comes around,
say something.

Oh, well, I hope you feel
better than you look!

05:28.762 --> 05:30.731
I doubt it.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.833
I'm sorry. I was
expecting Christina.

05:32.933 --> 05:34.402
Did you call her?

05:34.502 --> 05:37.571
Yeah, well, she's not
interested in helping...

05:37.671 --> 05:39.773
at all.

05:39.873 --> 05:41.875
(sighs) Got it.

05:41.975 --> 05:43.276
(indistinct talking)

05:43.377 --> 05:45.513
You mean,
you posted my bail?

05:45.613 --> 05:47.515
-Um, meh.
-How?!

05:47.615 --> 05:49.049
-You know --
-Where'd you get the money?

05:49.149 --> 05:51.585
I've been saving a lot of money
for a security deposit

05:51.685 --> 05:53.587
so I can move out
of my mom's place.

05:53.687 --> 05:57.024
And I was pretty --
I was pretty close!

05:57.124 --> 05:58.258
But it's fine.

05:58.358 --> 05:59.693
Lucy, th--

05:59.793 --> 06:03.864
(speaking Korean)

06:03.964 --> 06:07.100
"Even monkeys fall from trees,"
or whatever.

06:07.200 --> 06:10.370
That is a fact.

06:10.471 --> 06:11.905
This is dead.

06:12.005 --> 06:13.607
I need to check
my messages.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.275
Here.

06:16.810 --> 06:18.712
I'm going to get you
your money back.

06:18.812 --> 06:19.980
I promise you.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.482
Yeah.

06:21.582 --> 06:24.418
-Can you...?
-Yeah.

06:24.518 --> 06:26.119
How much did you put up?

06:26.219 --> 06:28.422
Um, $8,000.

06:28.522 --> 06:30.624
Jesus, Lucy.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.460
(phone vibrating)
I don't know what to say.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.628
You are a wanted man.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.597
(vibrating continues)

06:36.697 --> 06:38.331
(knock on door)

06:42.169 --> 06:43.136
What?

06:43.236 --> 06:44.472
She's okay.

06:44.572 --> 06:45.506
(sobs)
You saw her?

06:45.606 --> 06:47.174
No, but she, uh --
she called.

06:47.274 --> 06:49.109
She left a voicemail.

06:49.209 --> 06:51.011
She didn't say
where she is.

06:51.111 --> 06:52.446
Uh, she didn't say
where she's headed,

06:52.546 --> 06:53.814
but she said she's
going to reach out

06:53.914 --> 06:54.915
as soon as she gets
settled.

06:55.015 --> 06:57.250
She sounds pretty angry
at both of us.

06:57.350 --> 06:59.753
But she called you.
(sighs)

06:59.853 --> 07:02.355
That doesn't mean anything.

07:02.456 --> 07:05.125
You don't get to come in here
and tell me what things mean.

07:07.461 --> 07:09.597
We don't know where she is.

07:09.697 --> 07:11.532
And you just
got out of jail?

07:12.933 --> 07:15.435
Well, I think maybe
I understand

07:15.536 --> 07:17.004
what she might be
thinking right now.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.172
Right, no, you --
you understand.

07:19.272 --> 07:24.645
You -- You keep telling her
that the dangerous, furious way

07:24.745 --> 07:27.515
that's she's acting is --
it's natural.

07:29.149 --> 07:32.486
It's chemical,
it's -- it's not even her fault,

07:32.586 --> 07:37.324
because...she's exactly
like you.

07:37.424 --> 07:38.692
Which leaves me,

07:38.792 --> 07:40.794
and I don't understand anything.
-Christina --

07:40.894 --> 07:43.731
No, I don't, I don't
understand anything anymore.

07:43.831 --> 07:45.065
I just -- I-I sit here

07:45.165 --> 07:48.636
and I wait for
the next thing to happen.

07:56.243 --> 07:58.011
(grunting and shouting)

07:58.111 --> 07:59.647
(sighs)

07:59.747 --> 08:01.882
Since I am alone,
I'd like to be alone.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.684
(grunts)

08:07.655 --> 08:10.323
I'll call you
if I hear anything.

08:10.423 --> 08:13.827
**

08:13.927 --> 08:14.928
Aaah!

08:15.028 --> 08:17.665
(grunting)

08:23.837 --> 08:25.172
(gun cocks)

08:38.886 --> 08:44.725
**

08:44.825 --> 08:50.698
**

08:50.798 --> 08:56.704
**

09:00.908 --> 09:04.544
Our problem is you went to
that club looking for Pitt.

09:04.645 --> 09:07.114
And he didn't start the fight,
you did.

09:09.249 --> 09:11.619
(sighs) So, if all this
goes south,

09:11.719 --> 09:13.887
what am I looking at?

09:13.987 --> 09:15.789
Okay. Well...

09:17.290 --> 09:19.593
Anywhere from six months
to two years.

09:19.693 --> 09:20.894
Depends
on the judge's mood.

09:20.994 --> 09:22.562
Oh, fuck.

09:22.663 --> 09:26.466
Yeah. But let's cross that
bridge when we get to it.

09:26.566 --> 09:30.403
For now, is there anything else
you want to tell me?

09:30.503 --> 09:33.506
Anything I need to know?

09:33.607 --> 09:36.009
Yeah.

09:36.109 --> 09:40.247
There's been an issue recently
at the VOVC.

09:42.582 --> 09:47.287
Past patients, the people who
hurt them, victimized them --

09:47.387 --> 09:50.157
They've been attacked,
beaten.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.159
Okay.

09:52.259 --> 09:53.260
By who?

09:53.360 --> 09:55.528
You?

09:55.629 --> 09:57.364
Wait, don't answer that.

09:57.464 --> 10:01.669
Does anyone think you were
involved in these attacks?

10:01.769 --> 10:03.971
Or think they can
connect you to them?

10:04.071 --> 10:07.307
**

10:07.407 --> 10:09.276
Yeah.

10:14.214 --> 10:16.216
And she's pretty upset
about it.

10:16.316 --> 10:20.153
Okay. So,
what is she gonna do

10:20.253 --> 10:23.356
about what she thinks
she knows?

10:27.160 --> 10:28.796
WOMAN:
I don't know where she is!

10:28.896 --> 10:31.799
MAN: It's like sandwiches,
stuff like that.

10:31.899 --> 10:34.467
(indistinct talking)

10:41.474 --> 10:43.376
(knock on door)

10:45.545 --> 10:47.380
You serious?

10:50.050 --> 10:53.186
Hi. I heard maybe
I could stay here.

10:53.286 --> 10:54.988
My friend gave me
this address.

10:55.088 --> 10:56.223
Lexi?

10:56.323 --> 10:59.226
(indistinct talking)

10:59.326 --> 11:01.361
Um...

11:01.461 --> 11:03.831
if you want it, there's space
on the second floor.

11:03.931 --> 11:05.265
Okay.

11:05.365 --> 11:06.666
But that's all it is.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.902
Just space,
it's not a fucking dorm.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.504
Well, I can take care
of myself.

11:11.604 --> 11:12.840
(chuckles)

11:12.940 --> 11:14.407
Yeah, you're gonna have to.
Come on.

11:20.413 --> 11:22.215
LAMBERT: I got to be
in court by 2:00.

11:22.315 --> 11:25.085
But it matched.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.353
It did?

11:26.453 --> 11:28.555
The DNA on the fork
you gave me

11:28.655 --> 11:31.759
matched the DNA from
the Stevie Benjamin case.

11:31.859 --> 11:34.928
So, now, tit-for-tat.
Whose DNA was it?

11:37.430 --> 11:41.935
Frank Lambert,
Assistant District Attorney.

11:45.605 --> 11:46.907
Frank Lambert
that I know?

11:47.007 --> 11:48.075
Uh-huh.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.945
Frank Lambert?
(chuckles)

11:52.045 --> 11:53.580
Shut the fuck up.

11:55.148 --> 11:57.217
Are you pranking me?
Is this a prank?

11:57.317 --> 11:59.086
It's not a prank.

12:01.454 --> 12:04.057
When Stevie Benjamin
was killed,

12:04.157 --> 12:07.995
Frank Lambert was a teenager
living in Mendota.

12:08.095 --> 12:09.729
So was Ryan Winter.

12:09.830 --> 12:12.800
He was in foster care under
the name "Matthew Debbs."

12:12.900 --> 12:14.802
They both knew
Stevie Benjamin.

12:16.970 --> 12:19.572
I think they killed him
together.

12:27.614 --> 12:30.117
I couldn't figure out
why Hynes

12:30.217 --> 12:33.486
would go out to Winter's house
the night he was killed,

12:33.586 --> 12:35.856
but if Lambert called him,
if his friend Frank called him,

12:35.956 --> 12:38.158
he would have gone.

12:41.161 --> 12:42.963
Fuck.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.102
(door opens)

12:51.438 --> 12:53.506
I was afraid you'd
be gone already.

12:53.606 --> 12:54.808
(scoffs)

12:54.908 --> 12:57.310
I was at the bus station
when you called,

12:57.410 --> 13:00.380
about to go to Vegas.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.149
Are you okay?

13:02.249 --> 13:03.650
Yeah.

13:05.819 --> 13:07.620
Do you even know
what you did?

13:07.720 --> 13:09.322
Pretty sure I do.

13:09.422 --> 13:11.358
Those men you killed?

13:11.458 --> 13:13.793
They belonged to Hector.

13:13.894 --> 13:16.696
And he belongs to someone, too.
Where I come from --

13:16.796 --> 13:18.665
Everyone belongs
to someone else,

13:18.765 --> 13:20.467
and once his bosses
find out what you did,

13:20.567 --> 13:21.734
they're going to put a price
on your head

13:21.835 --> 13:23.303
and every gangbanger
in the East Bay

13:23.403 --> 13:25.338
is going to come after
to collect it.

13:25.438 --> 13:28.475
I wanted to help you,
and I will.

13:28.575 --> 13:30.210
Whatever it takes.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.178
"Whatever it takes."

13:31.278 --> 13:32.880
"Whatever it takes"
is Hector dead.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.348
Awesome.

13:35.448 --> 13:37.217
It's not a joke.
I know.

13:42.422 --> 13:47.160
If -- If we're
gonna do this,

13:47.260 --> 13:50.197
we have to ask first.

13:50.297 --> 13:52.332
To go after Hector,
we have to ask for permission.

13:52.432 --> 13:56.503
You can do that?
I can try!

13:56.603 --> 13:58.605
But it's gonna have to
be in person,

13:58.705 --> 14:00.273
and it's gonna have to be
down in TJ.

14:00.373 --> 14:02.075
And if it doesn't work,
then that's it.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.912
There's no more running,
there's no more anything.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.758
Okay.

14:18.858 --> 14:21.028
So, let's go.

14:21.128 --> 14:23.730
Let's go before
I change my mind.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.868
(zipper opening, closing)

14:28.969 --> 14:31.972
"D" --
what is "D" anyway?

14:32.072 --> 14:34.807
What is it, D-E-E?

14:34.908 --> 14:36.709
Or is it just
the letter "D"?

14:36.809 --> 14:37.945
If it's just the letter,

14:38.045 --> 14:40.247
then it's gotta have to
stand for something,

14:40.347 --> 14:41.748
so what does it
stand for?

14:41.848 --> 14:45.085
**

14:45.185 --> 14:47.220
Okay.
(chuckles)

14:47.320 --> 14:49.122
Okay, so you're just
going to come with me,

14:49.222 --> 14:52.059
and we're going to go
and ask for permission
to kill El Martillo,

14:52.159 --> 14:54.627
and you're not going to give me
your full name.

14:54.727 --> 14:59.166
Mm-hmm. This is crazy,
you and me, whatever.

14:59.266 --> 15:00.333
I don't even know
what is this.

15:01.501 --> 15:03.103
It feels like a story or
something, it's not even real.

15:03.203 --> 15:07.507
**

15:07.607 --> 15:11.945
**

15:12.045 --> 15:16.416
**

15:16.516 --> 15:20.820
**

15:20.920 --> 15:25.192
**

15:25.292 --> 15:27.494
It's as real as it gets.

15:27.594 --> 15:31.864
**

15:31.965 --> 15:36.303
**

15:36.403 --> 15:38.371
(sighs) Oh, fuck.

15:38.471 --> 15:40.507
-Cool.
-Careful not to spill there.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.309
Sid! Look at you.

15:42.409 --> 15:45.678
God, you're in court more than
you are on cases these days.

15:45.778 --> 15:48.448
What can I say?
I guess I just feel most
alive when I'm under oath.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.517
-(chuckles)
-This is Art Barnes.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.052
He's up here
from Mendota PD.

15:52.152 --> 15:53.386
-Hey. Mendota?
-Yep.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.488
You're kidding me.
I'm from Mendota!

15:55.588 --> 15:57.557
Oh my Go-- come on in.
You want to come in?

15:57.657 --> 15:59.226
Come on.

15:59.326 --> 16:00.793
How can I help
you guys?

16:00.893 --> 16:03.363
We got something we want to
talk to you about.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.365
Wait a minute, Sid.
I'm sorry.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.734
I just want to go out
on a limb here.

16:07.834 --> 16:09.636
Now, you show up
in my office,

16:09.736 --> 16:12.539
you got a detective with you
from Mendota.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.041
Now, that doesn't
happen every day,

16:14.141 --> 16:17.377
so I'm thinking...
cold case, right?

16:17.477 --> 16:19.079
And being from Mendota,

16:19.179 --> 16:21.514
there is only one case
that I ever heard of

16:21.614 --> 16:25.385
or can even think of that comes
close to fitting the bill.

16:25.485 --> 16:29.356
So, I got to ask,
is this about Stevie Benjamin?

16:31.724 --> 16:33.260
Yeah.

16:33.360 --> 16:37.197
Wow. Hmm, great.

16:37.297 --> 16:38.698
Well, how can I help?

16:41.268 --> 16:42.369
We've got a problem.

16:42.469 --> 16:45.072
Well, you're in
my domain here,

16:45.172 --> 16:46.773
so I can make
things happen.

16:46.873 --> 16:48.041
What do you need?
Search warrant?

16:48.141 --> 16:49.876
You've got a problem.

16:49.976 --> 16:51.744
(chuckles)

16:51.844 --> 16:53.613
I got a problem?

16:53.713 --> 16:55.282
Okay, what's my problem?

16:55.382 --> 16:59.752
In '91, DNA was taken from
the fingernails of Stevie.

16:59.852 --> 17:03.090
Long story short, comparative
analysis brought it back to you.

17:06.459 --> 17:08.761
How do you explain
that, Frank?

17:14.234 --> 17:15.935
(scoffs)

17:16.035 --> 17:18.305
Wow.

17:18.405 --> 17:21.074
(sighs)

17:21.174 --> 17:24.111
I mean, you guys knew
that we were friends, right?

17:24.211 --> 17:25.745
Stevie and I?

17:26.646 --> 17:30.383
We played basketball every
weekend and most weekdays,

17:30.483 --> 17:33.653
including the day
that he went missing.

17:33.753 --> 17:36.389
And when I say "play,"
we played.

17:36.489 --> 17:39.259
I mean, there was tripping,
elbows,

17:39.359 --> 17:40.827
except, um...

17:40.927 --> 17:43.230
Except what?

17:43.330 --> 17:46.933
I don't -- Look,
it's taken me a long time

17:47.033 --> 17:48.568
to get over this, okay?

17:48.668 --> 17:51.238
The way I left it
with Stevie that day.

17:51.338 --> 17:52.772
(sighs)

17:52.872 --> 17:55.742
Long story short, we were
playing like we always did.

17:55.842 --> 17:57.977
We got into it
over a jump ball.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.347
Punches were thrown,
Stevie got pissed,

18:00.447 --> 18:04.351
he took off,
and that was it, you know?

18:04.451 --> 18:06.119
That was the end of it.

18:06.219 --> 18:09.356
It happened a hundred --
hundred times before.

18:09.456 --> 18:12.925
I just figured...
(sighs)

18:13.025 --> 18:15.595
I just figured he'd get over it
by tomorrow, you know?

18:15.695 --> 18:21.168
And then -- Or I'd say
I was sorry, but...

18:21.268 --> 18:24.537
I guess tomorrow never came.

18:24.637 --> 18:27.540
Anyway, I'm sorry, guys.

18:27.640 --> 18:31.978
You must have thought --
I don't know what you thought.

18:32.078 --> 18:35.315
But I got no answers.

18:35.415 --> 18:37.317
Just sad memories.

18:39.386 --> 18:41.120
Anyway, I got court,

18:41.221 --> 18:45.292
so I'm afraid I got to
cut it short right now.

18:45.392 --> 18:47.294
But I'll see you guys out.

18:50.397 --> 18:52.699
And I want to thank you guys
both for coming.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.801
I know it's a long way.

18:54.901 --> 18:57.036
**

18:57.136 --> 19:01.808
Hey, uh, if you wanted
my DNA,

19:01.908 --> 19:04.577
I would have spit in a cup
for you, Sid.

19:04.677 --> 19:07.914
All you had to do was ask.

19:08.014 --> 19:13.486
I mean, we're supposed to be
friends, aren't we?

19:16.389 --> 19:19.091
You have a safe trip back,
Detective.

19:24.764 --> 19:28.368
**

19:28.468 --> 19:32.004
**

19:32.104 --> 19:34.040
(shouting in distance)

19:34.140 --> 19:37.844
**

19:37.944 --> 19:39.111
(chuckles)

19:39.212 --> 19:41.848
(knock on door)

19:41.948 --> 19:44.784
CHANCE: So, what does that mean?
What do we do now?

19:44.884 --> 19:48.688
Nothing.
There's nothing we can do.

19:48.788 --> 19:51.924
If Lambert had said that
he didn't know Stevie,

19:52.024 --> 19:55.027
that he'd never crossed
paths with him,

19:55.127 --> 19:58.231
we'd have the DNA
to call him a liar.

19:58.331 --> 20:00.400
But he said that
they were friends.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.235
He explained it away.

20:02.335 --> 20:03.936
And you believed him?

20:04.036 --> 20:07.374
No. And he knows it.

20:07.474 --> 20:09.876
But we got nothing else,
and he knows that, too.

20:12.612 --> 20:14.547
You know, hearing about
Stevie's murder

20:14.647 --> 20:17.216
when I was a kid --

20:17.317 --> 20:22.789
Living through that fear
made me want to become a cop.

20:22.889 --> 20:26.759
**

20:26.859 --> 20:29.095
I never thought
I'd find his killer.

20:30.463 --> 20:31.498
(glasses clink)

20:31.598 --> 20:33.566
I thought that was
bad enough,

20:33.666 --> 20:37.270
but...now I know it wasn't.

20:37.370 --> 20:40.172
Now I know there's
something worse.

20:41.941 --> 20:44.644
LAMBERT:
Did Winter say anything about it
when he confessed to you?

20:44.744 --> 20:46.245
No.

20:46.346 --> 20:47.580
What do you think?

20:47.680 --> 20:50.417
Do you think he -- you think
he had an accomplice?

20:58.625 --> 21:00.660
Jesus!

21:00.760 --> 21:02.329
What happened this time?

21:02.429 --> 21:03.930
I got stupid.

21:04.030 --> 21:06.499
He got jumped
by Barrio Cazadores.

21:06.599 --> 21:10.370
It's a long story,
and it isn't finished yet.

21:11.471 --> 21:13.039
What does that mean?

21:13.139 --> 21:15.642
It's fine.
I'm gonna fix it.

21:15.742 --> 21:18.445
We're heading down to Tijuana
to work out the details.

21:18.545 --> 21:20.513
-Is that a smart idea?
-Yup.

21:20.613 --> 21:23.015
I need to get my stuff.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.651
What's up?

21:24.751 --> 21:28.355
Velerio went to Lambert
with the DNA results.

21:29.522 --> 21:31.724
Let me guess.

21:31.824 --> 21:34.527
Lambert slithered out
from under him somehow.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.899
So, that's it then.

21:39.999 --> 21:43.870
Lambert was ready for us before
we even knew he existed, doc.

21:43.970 --> 21:46.138
He's out of our reach.

21:46.238 --> 21:48.408
So don't beat yourself up.

21:48.508 --> 21:50.242
Hynes of all people
would understand.

21:50.343 --> 21:52.144
You went to the wall
over this.

21:52.244 --> 21:54.046
I got arrested.

21:54.146 --> 21:56.215
What the fuck are
you talking about?

21:56.315 --> 21:58.518
Aggravated battery.

21:58.618 --> 22:00.920
I'm out on bail now.

22:01.020 --> 22:05.358
Apparently Dawson Pitt picked me
out of a photo lineup.

22:07.259 --> 22:09.696
Sounds like you should come
to Mexico with us.

22:09.796 --> 22:11.598
Can't.
Got to go to court.

22:11.698 --> 22:15.267
Lucy posted the bail, so she's
on the hook for the money.

22:15.368 --> 22:17.904
I-I get all that,
but you should still come.

22:18.004 --> 22:19.939
Why?

22:20.039 --> 22:21.674
What are you even
going there to do?

22:21.774 --> 22:22.942
Not important.

22:23.042 --> 22:25.878
It sort of really is
important, actually.

22:25.978 --> 22:28.915
Don't tell me this is
some kind of cartel thing.

22:29.015 --> 22:30.583
Christ!

22:30.683 --> 22:33.720
Have you and she ever even been
to the fucking movies?

22:33.820 --> 22:36.623
Why are you trying to argue
about this, doc?

22:38.124 --> 22:40.259
You said Pitt picked you
out of a lineup.

22:40.359 --> 22:44.296
You got an alibi I don't know
about, or an evil twin?

22:44.397 --> 22:47.199
So, you're just gonna go to
court and see what happens?

22:47.299 --> 22:48.535
I'll tell you what happens --

22:48.635 --> 22:50.437
You're going to prison,
leaving your daughter --

22:50.537 --> 22:52.439
the thing you've said
you'd never do.

22:54.574 --> 22:57.977
Two years.
That's what they say.

22:58.077 --> 22:59.812
But your name's
not going to come up,

22:59.912 --> 23:00.913
whatever happens,
I promise you that.

23:01.013 --> 23:02.649
What the fuck, doc?!

23:02.749 --> 23:05.752
I don't --
Honestly, I don't regret it.

23:05.852 --> 23:06.919
I don't.

23:07.019 --> 23:08.220
I don't regret
what I've done

23:08.320 --> 23:11.290
or what I've asked you
to do on my behalf.

23:11.390 --> 23:12.459
I'm guilty of it.

23:12.559 --> 23:14.160
I'm gonna take
responsibility for it.

23:14.260 --> 23:16.796
That's probably the best thing
I can do for Nicole right now.

23:16.896 --> 23:19.065
Pretty stupid, getting
locked up and leaving her

23:19.165 --> 23:20.667
over a fucking moral
abstraction.

23:20.767 --> 23:22.602
Is it?

23:22.702 --> 23:25.404
An abstraction, I mean.

23:25.505 --> 23:27.273
Because it feels
real to me.

23:27.373 --> 23:30.242
I felt guilty because
I wasn't able to do more.

23:30.342 --> 23:32.011
So I did more.

23:32.111 --> 23:35.582
And I reinforced
the cycle of fallout

23:35.682 --> 23:36.783
that we're all trapped in

23:36.883 --> 23:38.485
because I wanted to
have control.

23:38.585 --> 23:41.420
But I didn't have control
'cause no one has control.

23:41.521 --> 23:43.122
But...

23:43.222 --> 23:46.859
So, why you did it
doesn't matter?

23:46.959 --> 23:49.028
All intents and purposes,

23:49.128 --> 23:51.464
you and Matty Willis
are the same?

23:51.564 --> 23:55.134
And Wade Pardo and Lambert?
Because you're not.

23:55.234 --> 23:58.538
Everyone's got to take
responsibility

23:58.638 --> 24:02.475
for what we're doing, for what
we've done to each other.

24:02.575 --> 24:04.811
And I can't ask
of other people

24:04.944 --> 24:07.013
something that I won't
ask of myself.

24:08.314 --> 24:10.316
I can get money, doc.

24:10.416 --> 24:11.784
You can pay Lucy back
on the deal,

24:11.884 --> 24:13.119
but you need to come
with us.

24:13.219 --> 24:14.654
No, D, no.

24:14.754 --> 24:17.824
What you did,
what we did --

24:17.924 --> 24:19.492
you were just
trying to help.

24:19.592 --> 24:22.061
Yeah, I was trying to help,
but I didn't.

24:22.161 --> 24:24.063
And so that means you should
go into the system?

24:24.163 --> 24:25.331
You can't just show up

24:25.431 --> 24:28.134
and tell me I'm supposed to
leave you here to that.

24:29.569 --> 24:33.139
Doc, I get that you
want to atone, to do penance,

24:33.239 --> 24:36.208
but find another way.
There has to be one.

24:38.678 --> 24:40.246
Please!

24:45.351 --> 24:47.186
It'll be all right.

24:49.589 --> 24:52.058
No, it won't.

24:55.394 --> 24:57.997
(sighs)
You should probably go.

25:01.433 --> 25:06.739
**

25:06.839 --> 25:12.044
**

25:12.144 --> 25:17.416
**

25:17.516 --> 25:22.889
**

25:28.127 --> 25:29.929
What the fuck are you
doing here, Eldon?

25:30.029 --> 25:32.632
I told you,
"Don't come back here"!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

25:32.732 --> 25:34.567
And I'm sorry all of this
landed on you,

25:34.667 --> 25:36.535
but I'm gonna make
it right.

25:37.770 --> 25:40.539
I'm going to plead guilty
to assaulting Dawson Pitt.

25:40.640 --> 25:43.142
You d assault him!

25:43.242 --> 25:44.777
Just because you're throwing
yourself on your sword

25:44.877 --> 25:47.046
doesn't make that go away.
-It's gonna end this.

25:47.146 --> 25:49.782
It's going to take the attention
off you, off the unit.

25:49.882 --> 25:52.785
It's going to let your donors
and your grant writers relax.

25:52.885 --> 25:56.488
It's not just Dawson Pitt!
It's all of them!

25:56.589 --> 25:59.458
It's your bald friend
still roaming around the streets

25:59.558 --> 26:00.993
like some kind
of assassin.

26:01.093 --> 26:02.394
This is all me.

26:02.494 --> 26:05.297
It starts and ends with me.

26:05.397 --> 26:09.068
That's for the police
to decide...

26:09.168 --> 26:13.105
for a court,
for a judge.

26:15.107 --> 26:17.910
Well, that's up to you.

26:18.010 --> 26:20.680
(scoffs)

26:20.780 --> 26:23.983
So my choice is to sit on
what I know,

26:24.083 --> 26:26.819
become another one
of your accomplices,

26:26.919 --> 26:30.757
or watch this place
turn into a punchline,

26:30.857 --> 26:33.993
undermine everything
that it stands for.

26:34.093 --> 26:37.596
**

26:37.697 --> 26:41.133
**

26:41.233 --> 26:44.971
Leave.
Or I'll call security.

26:48.607 --> 26:51.177
(door opens)

26:53.512 --> 26:56.548
D: So, you ready to tell me
who we're going to see?

26:56.649 --> 26:59.218
A friend from when
I was a kid.

26:59.318 --> 27:02.989
He used to live in a Catholic
orphanage and later the street.

27:04.556 --> 27:08.494
At mealtime, my grandmother
would feed him also.

27:08.594 --> 27:10.396
We were close.

27:10.496 --> 27:14.667
(Brian Jonestown Massacre's
"Anemone" plays)

27:14.767 --> 27:17.804
* I wanna know how you feel

27:17.904 --> 27:22.141
**

27:22.241 --> 27:25.878
* 'Cause I

27:25.978 --> 27:29.248
* I only play it for real

27:29.348 --> 27:31.884
**

27:31.984 --> 27:34.854
* You should be picking me up

27:34.954 --> 27:37.556
**

27:37.656 --> 27:40.760
* Instead you're
dragging me down *

27:40.860 --> 27:42.762
**

27:42.862 --> 27:44.764
You were close.

27:44.864 --> 27:46.565
What happened?

27:46.665 --> 27:48.768
("Anemone" continues playing)

27:48.868 --> 27:51.003
(sighs) We grew up.

27:51.103 --> 27:54.941
I went to work
for my tía Lina in her business,

27:55.041 --> 27:58.677
coyotaje -- smuggling
people into Cali.

27:58.778 --> 28:01.580
She did it right.
She took care of people,

28:01.680 --> 28:07.053
didn't cheat them, and he went
to work for the cartel.

28:07.153 --> 28:08.687
Now he runs the interests

28:08.788 --> 28:11.390
for the cartel in Tijuana
and El Norte.

28:11.490 --> 28:15.227
But Cesar never forgot us,
my abuela and me.

28:15.327 --> 28:17.129
He never forgot
what we did for him

28:17.229 --> 28:20.900
when he was young...
and helpless.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.270
Is he friends
with Hector?

28:24.370 --> 28:28.440
Hector is...
useful to him.

28:28.540 --> 28:32.244
**

28:32.344 --> 28:36.048
**

28:36.148 --> 28:39.551
And what about you?

28:39.651 --> 28:41.587
Am I friends with Hector?
No.

28:41.687 --> 28:45.257
**

28:45.357 --> 28:48.327
What happened with him?

28:50.129 --> 28:53.499
He loved me, and...

28:53.599 --> 28:55.835
I thought that I would
be all right.

28:55.935 --> 28:59.738
I thought that I could deal
with it,

28:59.839 --> 29:01.440
but I couldn't.

29:01.540 --> 29:03.509
**

29:03.609 --> 29:05.344
I can't.

29:05.444 --> 29:09.148
**

29:09.248 --> 29:12.985
**

29:13.085 --> 29:16.789
**

29:16.889 --> 29:19.158
(shouting in distance)

29:29.501 --> 29:31.170
Lorena.

29:33.005 --> 29:35.007
(speaking Spanish)

29:36.308 --> 29:39.178
Gracias.

29:39.278 --> 29:41.848
This is my friend D.

29:47.887 --> 29:51.490
The man with
the pencils, right?

29:54.626 --> 29:56.963
It's nice to see you
again, Lori.

29:57.063 --> 29:59.731
You left without
saying goodbye.

29:59.832 --> 30:02.835
I'm sorry.
I know.

30:02.935 --> 30:05.571
And I know it wasn't easy.

30:05.671 --> 30:07.573
Not for Hector, either.

30:07.673 --> 30:10.342
All he wants to talk
about is you.

30:10.442 --> 30:12.544
And about the baby.

30:12.644 --> 30:15.214
His baby.

30:15.314 --> 30:17.549
You know what
you're having yet?

30:21.187 --> 30:22.654
A boy.

30:22.754 --> 30:25.524
Wonderful.

30:25.624 --> 30:27.159
And does Hector know?

30:27.259 --> 30:29.195
That you're having a boy?

30:33.565 --> 30:36.268
So, is that why
you are here, maybe?

30:36.368 --> 30:38.905
To ask me to persuade him
to leave you alone?

30:39.005 --> 30:41.073
There is no
persuading Hector.

30:41.173 --> 30:42.942
No, there is not.

30:43.042 --> 30:44.676
Why he's so good
at what he does.

30:44.776 --> 30:47.279
(chuckles) I know.

30:47.379 --> 30:49.248
I know the way things are.

30:51.183 --> 30:54.586
I've come to ask for permission
to change them.

30:54.686 --> 30:56.956
(chuckles)

30:57.056 --> 31:00.059
Change them?

31:00.159 --> 31:02.028
Only one way to do that.

31:04.630 --> 31:07.299
I can replace El Martillo,

31:07.399 --> 31:09.535
but if things don't go
how you want,

31:09.635 --> 31:11.703
can your child replace
his mother?

31:11.803 --> 31:14.941
If things don't go
the way that I want,

31:15.041 --> 31:17.143
my child won't ever know
that I existed.

31:17.243 --> 31:18.544
So...

31:18.644 --> 31:23.882
**

31:23.983 --> 31:26.618
You try.

31:26.718 --> 31:29.088
And I won't stand
in your way.

31:29.188 --> 31:31.790
But if you succeed,

31:31.890 --> 31:34.160
you come back
and work for me.

31:35.461 --> 31:37.997
No matter what the business is,
the business is coyotaje.

31:38.097 --> 31:39.598
No.

31:41.100 --> 31:44.236
She wanted out. She was out.
She stays out.

31:44.336 --> 31:46.405
Martillo goes away,
it'll be on me.

31:46.505 --> 31:49.408
I'll owe you then,
but not her, not anymore.

31:49.508 --> 31:52.678
If you can take care
of El Martillo,

31:52.778 --> 31:56.248
you might be worth
something...to someone.

32:00.119 --> 32:03.255
My guess would be
you and I never speak again.

32:10.529 --> 32:12.464
D: How often does
he come here, do you know?

32:12.564 --> 32:14.200
Once in the morning
and once at night,

32:14.300 --> 32:17.136
but it's been a long time
since I've been here.

32:17.236 --> 32:18.770
I don't --

32:18.870 --> 32:20.539
Hector.

32:22.774 --> 32:24.443
He's careful.

32:24.543 --> 32:27.446
I'd say his guys
have some training.

32:27.546 --> 32:30.182
I like how they carry
themselves.

32:30.282 --> 32:32.451
You like it?

32:32.551 --> 32:34.020
I don't.

32:34.120 --> 32:35.387
I don't like any of it.

32:35.487 --> 32:37.656
How can you go up
against so many?

32:37.756 --> 32:39.625
(music plays indistinctly)

32:39.725 --> 32:41.893
Maybe...

32:41.994 --> 32:43.162
Maybe we should go back.

32:43.262 --> 32:44.530
When he's not here?

32:44.630 --> 32:47.333
One guy in charge
with a gun.

32:48.467 --> 32:49.968
That's it?

32:50.069 --> 32:51.570
One guy, one gun?

32:51.670 --> 32:54.373
Everybody knows this is
a cartel safe house,

32:54.473 --> 32:56.375
El Martillo's house.

32:56.475 --> 33:01.013
So Hector doesn't need
a big crew to hold it.

33:01.113 --> 33:05.217
It's just the fear
is enough.

33:15.994 --> 33:17.729
There's a car behind us.

33:19.498 --> 33:21.933
I think
they're following us.

33:23.035 --> 33:24.370
D!

33:24.470 --> 33:28.174
**

33:28.274 --> 33:30.442
They're still there.

33:30.542 --> 33:32.211
**

33:32.311 --> 33:34.780
There's no turn here.

33:34.880 --> 33:36.915
D, there's
no turning here!

33:37.015 --> 33:38.517
What?!

33:38.617 --> 33:43.055
**

33:43.155 --> 33:47.593
**

33:47.693 --> 33:52.231
**

33:52.331 --> 33:56.768
**

33:56.868 --> 34:01.307
**

34:01.407 --> 34:03.875
Kai, Raf, Jaimito,

34:03.975 --> 34:06.112
Gomez, Snake, Triple E.

34:06.212 --> 34:08.614
This is Lorena.

34:08.714 --> 34:11.250
(sighs)
You stupid shit!

34:11.350 --> 34:14.220
(men chuckle)

34:14.320 --> 34:15.987
I'm sorry.

34:16.088 --> 34:19.091
This is the tribe.
Some of it, anyway.

34:19.191 --> 34:21.727
I called them to come down
from Oakland.

34:21.827 --> 34:25.564
I wasn't going to underestimate
an opponent twice in one week.

34:26.832 --> 34:28.667
Let's see
what you brought.

34:28.767 --> 34:34.440
**

34:34.540 --> 34:40.146
**

34:40.246 --> 34:42.748
D: Beautiful.

34:42.848 --> 34:44.350
Great.

34:46.452 --> 34:47.686
All right.

34:47.786 --> 34:49.355
We'll meet back here
tomorrow night.

34:49.455 --> 34:50.922
Copy that.

34:53.325 --> 35:00.098
**

35:00.199 --> 35:01.833
(engine starts)

35:01.933 --> 35:06.205
**

35:06.305 --> 35:10.542
**

35:10.642 --> 35:12.211
(truck departs)

35:12.311 --> 35:14.713
My name is Darius Pringle.

35:23.522 --> 35:25.857
Apology accepted.

35:36.034 --> 35:39.805
**

35:39.905 --> 35:41.840
(phone rings)

35:41.940 --> 35:44.376
WOMAN:
You have one new message.

35:44.476 --> 35:47.513
(beep)
NICOLE: Hey, Dad, it's me.

35:47.613 --> 35:49.381
I thought it over,
and I realized

35:49.481 --> 35:52.351
I wasn't being very
responsible.

35:52.451 --> 35:54.186
I should have at least told you
where I was going.

35:54.286 --> 35:55.554
TAS: She's up there.

35:55.654 --> 35:58.023
I'm in Oakland.

35:58.123 --> 36:01.227
I'm staying at this house
on Argyle Street, 4051.

36:01.327 --> 36:03.229
(indistinct conversations)

36:03.329 --> 36:06.265
I'm using someone else's phone,
so don't bother calling back,

36:06.365 --> 36:08.066
but I just thought you should
know where I am

36:08.166 --> 36:09.901
in case of an emergency.

36:10.001 --> 36:15.006
**

36:15.106 --> 36:20.178
**

36:20.279 --> 36:25.284
**

36:25.384 --> 36:27.185
CHANCE: Hey.

36:27.286 --> 36:30.055
Nic, I swear to you
I had nothing to do

36:30.155 --> 36:33.191
with the decision
to send you to that camp.

36:33.292 --> 36:35.427
Your mom -- She didn't
tell me about it

36:35.527 --> 36:36.862
until after she'd done it.

36:36.962 --> 36:39.598
And I drove out there. I was --
I was gonna come get you,

36:39.698 --> 36:43.535
and I --
(sighs) I got arrested.

36:43.635 --> 36:44.870
What?

36:44.970 --> 36:47.939
I -- I beat someone up.

36:48.039 --> 36:50.208
(sighs)

36:50.309 --> 36:52.077
Oh, babe.

36:52.177 --> 36:54.813
Oh, God,
it's good to see you.

36:54.913 --> 36:56.081
How're you doing?

36:56.181 --> 36:57.716
I'm okay.

36:57.816 --> 37:00.252
Listen, Nic,
I am going to plead guilty.

37:00.352 --> 37:01.953
Why?

37:02.053 --> 37:03.589
Because I am.

37:03.689 --> 37:07.326
Because I did it,
and I needed to stop.

37:07.426 --> 37:08.994
Yeah, but,
so you go to prison?

37:09.094 --> 37:10.128
Uh-huh.

37:10.228 --> 37:11.430
For how long?

37:11.530 --> 37:14.232
I don't know.
Could be two years.

37:15.434 --> 37:17.336
It could be less.
It could be less!

37:17.436 --> 37:20.939
Hey, listen, Nic,
you're -- two years.

37:22.173 --> 37:24.410
Two years,
you're going to be eighteen.

37:24.510 --> 37:26.312
All right, you're going to be
starting out

37:26.412 --> 37:27.913
on a whole,
new stage of life.

37:28.747 --> 37:32.117
Maybe we can take that step
together.

37:32.217 --> 37:34.786
(voice breaking) Yeah, but
what happens until then?

37:34.886 --> 37:36.588
(sighs)

37:36.688 --> 37:38.123
Dad, no.

37:38.223 --> 37:40.191
Dad, no, I-I can't live
with her, you know that!

37:40.292 --> 37:42.961
Yeah, I know.
Listen, listen.

37:44.996 --> 37:48.334
Look, I know you're --
I know you're angry.

37:48.434 --> 37:49.868
(sighs)

37:49.968 --> 37:54.540
But people fuck up,
all right?

37:54.640 --> 37:57.343
It's the -- it's the
distinguishing characteristic

37:57.443 --> 37:59.711
of our species.

38:01.513 --> 38:05.283
And bad decisions,
they can come from malice

38:05.384 --> 38:08.787
or sometimes love,
but if you think hard,

38:08.887 --> 38:12.558
you know deep down what side of
the line your mother lives on.

38:12.658 --> 38:16.061
**

38:16.161 --> 38:17.629
(sniffles)

38:17.729 --> 38:20.966
And I know that you're not
the only one who feels lost.

38:21.066 --> 38:22.968
Dad, I can't!

38:23.068 --> 38:26.004
I can't just go back to her
like it didn't happen!

38:26.104 --> 38:27.639
Honey,
you can't stay here.

38:27.739 --> 38:29.341
Well, I-I could stay
with Carl and D.

38:29.441 --> 38:32.310
No, baby. Carl's with his
family. D's in Tijuana.

38:32.411 --> 38:34.513
Well, then, here.

38:34.613 --> 38:36.582
Dad, you're going
to prison.

38:36.682 --> 38:38.417
Here is the only place.

38:38.517 --> 38:41.820
**

38:41.920 --> 38:43.755
Well, then, where?

38:43.855 --> 38:48.026
**

38:48.126 --> 38:52.263
**

38:52.364 --> 38:56.502
**

38:56.602 --> 39:00.739
**

39:00.839 --> 39:04.943
**

39:05.043 --> 39:07.579
Thank you, Lucy.
It means a lot

39:07.679 --> 39:08.947
just knowing she's here
with you

39:09.047 --> 39:11.016
until she figures
stuff out with her mother.

39:11.116 --> 39:13.619
I-I can't tell you --
-You don't have to. I get it.

39:13.719 --> 39:16.121
I mean, hmm,
I don't -- I don't get it,

39:16.221 --> 39:18.724
but I assume that I will
one day

39:18.824 --> 39:22.794
and, in the meantime,
actual free babysitting.

39:25.564 --> 39:27.365
I got something for you.

39:27.466 --> 39:29.701
(trunk opens)

39:32.070 --> 39:33.204
What?

39:33.304 --> 39:34.873
Now, if you want
to sell this,

39:34.973 --> 39:36.908
I would ask for 8 grand
to start with.

39:37.008 --> 39:40.245
If you want to keep it,
I bet it will appreciate.

39:40.345 --> 39:42.280
It's a painting
I bought with Nicole.

39:42.380 --> 39:43.782
It used to hang
in my living room.

39:43.882 --> 39:45.617
It just makes me happy,
I don't know why.

39:45.717 --> 39:48.219
You should keep it.

39:48.319 --> 39:50.255
I don't think they're
gonna let me decorate.

39:50.355 --> 39:53.625
Oh, um, yeah, okay.

39:53.725 --> 39:55.293
Uh, thank you.

39:57.162 --> 40:00.432
Listen, I-I understand
how your parents feel,

40:00.532 --> 40:02.100
but I think
they're wrong.

40:02.200 --> 40:05.270
Besides the occasional
lapse in judgment,

40:05.370 --> 40:07.439
I think you could
really help people.

40:07.539 --> 40:09.608
And you deserve that.

40:09.708 --> 40:10.942
I think you should
go back to school,

40:11.042 --> 40:12.511
you should get your degree,
and get out there,

40:12.611 --> 40:15.914
and you can be for patients
what you've always been for me.

40:16.014 --> 40:18.016
Yeah. Okay. I will.

40:19.985 --> 40:21.352
Good.

40:21.453 --> 40:23.755
**

40:23.855 --> 40:25.256
Anyway...

40:25.356 --> 40:27.826
**

40:27.926 --> 40:31.863
And I want you to figure out
how to be in the world

40:31.963 --> 40:34.199
in a way
that doesn't hurt you.

40:34.299 --> 40:36.802
You deserve that.

40:36.902 --> 40:40.872
**

40:40.972 --> 40:44.943
**

40:45.043 --> 40:46.845
JUDGE MATHEWS:
Dr. Chance, to the charge

40:46.945 --> 40:48.780
of aggravated battery,
how do you plead?

40:48.880 --> 40:52.150
Guilty or not guilty?
-Guilty.

40:52.250 --> 40:54.853
By entering a plea of guilty,
you'll be giving up your right

40:54.953 --> 40:56.555
to have a trial,
do you understand?

40:56.655 --> 40:57.823
I do.

40:57.923 --> 40:59.457
Accordingly,
I find the defendant

40:59.558 --> 41:01.226
is acting voluntarily

41:01.326 --> 41:03.228
and that he fully understands
his rights.

41:03.328 --> 41:05.497
Therefore, I accept
the plea of guilty

41:05.597 --> 41:07.298
to the charge
of aggravated battery

41:07.398 --> 41:11.069
as outlined
in docket number 401217.

41:11.169 --> 41:14.239
I see the state has submitted
their sentencing recommendation?

41:14.339 --> 41:16.307
Yes, Your Honor.

41:16.407 --> 41:18.143
Given the violent nature
of this crime

41:18.243 --> 41:21.146
and the serious injuries
Mr. Pitt sustained,

41:21.246 --> 41:24.182
we ask the court for the maximum
sentence of four years.

41:24.282 --> 41:26.417
I understand that both parties
want to present witnesses

41:26.518 --> 41:28.754
to help with my sentencing
recommendation.

41:28.854 --> 41:31.189
Mr. Jakes, I have your list
of names here.

41:31.289 --> 41:32.658
Yes, Your Honor.

41:32.758 --> 41:35.026
And the prosecution would
like to present someone,

41:35.126 --> 41:36.728
Ms. Saavedra?
-Yes, Your Honor.

41:36.828 --> 41:39.565
I expect Dr. Clayton
to be here shortly.

41:39.665 --> 41:42.534
KIRSTEN: Did you look at all
the fear around you?

41:42.634 --> 41:46.938
The pain, the randomness,
and think,

41:47.038 --> 41:49.040
"I'm going to become
a fucking vigilante"?

41:50.842 --> 41:52.778
Mr. Jakes,
are you ready to proceed?

41:52.878 --> 41:53.845
Yes, Your Honor.

41:53.945 --> 41:56.181
And there are people
here today

41:56.281 --> 41:59.751
who have asked to be heard
on behalf of Dr. Chance.

42:02.120 --> 42:06.024
ALEX: When the lawsuit against
Dawson Pitt fell apart,

42:06.124 --> 42:10.128
my dad just, like, went dark.

42:10.228 --> 42:12.263
SANDRA: 'Til I started working
with Dr. Chance,

42:12.363 --> 42:15.466
I'd -- I'd wake up screaming
every single night.

42:15.567 --> 42:18.870
My son had just turned 13
when I got shot.

42:18.970 --> 42:20.872
Not anymore.

42:20.972 --> 42:23.074
GRETCHEN: I had to stop taking
BART to work

42:23.174 --> 42:26.244
because I was scared of
everybody who got on.

42:26.344 --> 42:28.446
CLARA: People were nice
in the beginning,

42:28.546 --> 42:29.781
but they got tired of it.

42:29.881 --> 42:32.984
JIMMY: Dr. Chance, he sat down
with Eddie on his own time

42:33.084 --> 42:34.620
to talk him through it.

42:34.720 --> 42:37.823
I'm not saying people should
break the law or whatever,

42:37.923 --> 42:41.126
but I-I feel like I know
why he did what he did.

42:41.226 --> 42:44.329
KIRSTEN:
You've risked everything
I've worked for my whole life.

42:44.429 --> 42:46.397
The only hope
for all these people

42:46.497 --> 42:48.934
who have almost been destroyed,
and for what?

42:49.034 --> 42:53.839
I think he wanted to stand up
for us -- for me and my dad.

42:53.939 --> 42:58.644
Dr. Chance helped me realize
who I am,

42:58.744 --> 43:01.747
other than just a victim.

43:01.847 --> 43:06.484
**

43:06.584 --> 43:09.487
Ms. Saavedra, where are we
with Dr. Clayton?

43:09.587 --> 43:11.857
Dr. Clayton left a message
that she won't be coming.

43:11.957 --> 43:14.092
If it pleases the court --
-I'm moving on.

43:14.192 --> 43:15.661
-Yes, Your Honor.
-Good.

43:15.761 --> 43:18.263
I'll consider the additional
testimony provided,

43:18.363 --> 43:20.431
reconvene in two days' time
for sentencing.

43:20.531 --> 43:21.499
(gavel bangs)

43:24.936 --> 43:26.638
(brakes squeal)

43:31.877 --> 43:34.512
(speaking indistinctly)

43:37.783 --> 43:40.318
(indistinct talking)

43:42.153 --> 43:47.058
**

43:47.158 --> 43:49.127
(gun cocks)

43:49.227 --> 43:51.863
(indistinct shouting)

43:56.534 --> 43:58.069
You can turn around.

43:58.169 --> 44:01.907
(dog barking)

44:02.007 --> 44:04.242
(speaking Spanish)

44:04.342 --> 44:06.344
It was you.

44:06.444 --> 44:07.979
Oakland, huh?

44:08.079 --> 44:10.916
The man looking to die
for some pussy.

44:12.017 --> 44:14.419
I'm not the one
who's gonna die.

44:14.519 --> 44:15.987
Not yet.

44:16.087 --> 44:17.889
You want to live?
Take her and go.

44:17.989 --> 44:21.659
She means nothing to me,
worse than a Tijuana whore.

44:21.760 --> 44:25.831
But sometime soon,
when the time is right,

44:25.931 --> 44:28.399
I'm coming for my son.

44:28.499 --> 44:31.269
That is my best offer.

44:31.369 --> 44:36.074
Mine...is you get
to pick how you die.

44:36.174 --> 44:39.010
I'd like to gut you like
the fat fuck you are.

44:39.110 --> 44:42.748
Your asshole friends
can shoot me when you're dead.

44:42.848 --> 44:44.382
Awesome.

44:49.220 --> 44:50.789
(grunting)

44:50.889 --> 44:53.124
(dog barking)

45:00.531 --> 45:05.136
(barking continues)

45:26.992 --> 45:29.227
(knock on door)

45:31.963 --> 45:33.498
Hey!

45:35.733 --> 45:37.102
What do you want?

45:37.202 --> 45:39.004
"What do I want?"
I want to come inside.

45:39.104 --> 45:40.839
It's about to start
pouring.

45:40.939 --> 45:42.107
Come on.

45:42.207 --> 45:44.475
Thanks.

45:44.575 --> 45:46.411
You know, you probably
already know this,

45:46.511 --> 45:49.414
but you do not live in
a good neighborhood, my friend.

45:49.514 --> 45:52.483
I got your address.
I thought it was a mistake.

45:52.583 --> 45:56.087
You know, cops call this block
"Pill Hill". So --

45:56.187 --> 45:57.823
Why are you here?

45:57.923 --> 46:00.158
Why are you so hostile?

46:00.258 --> 46:02.660
And why are you surprised
to see me?

46:02.760 --> 46:05.596
This is what I do
for a living, okay?

46:05.696 --> 46:07.298
I'm in the closure
business.

46:07.398 --> 46:10.168
Like, uh, that DNA shit?

46:10.268 --> 46:12.938
That started with you,
right?

46:13.038 --> 46:14.505
What DNA shit?

46:14.605 --> 46:16.975
Come on.

46:17.075 --> 46:19.644
Show me your phone.

46:23.882 --> 46:26.617
Wake it up,
close all the windows.

46:26.717 --> 46:30.288
Yeah, see, that's
a good, little app, right?

46:30.388 --> 46:33.324
Person could do
real damage with that.

46:33.424 --> 46:34.826
Put it on the table.

46:39.965 --> 46:41.699
Okay.

46:41.799 --> 46:43.902
Now, where were we?

46:44.002 --> 46:45.236
Oh, I remember!

46:45.336 --> 46:47.839
Sid Velerio and that
fucking hump from Mendota

46:47.939 --> 46:50.308
coming to my office,
trying to entrap me.

46:50.408 --> 46:52.143
That was good.

46:52.243 --> 46:54.379
Were you behind that?

46:54.479 --> 46:56.347
The DNA started with Hynes.

46:56.447 --> 46:57.715
I just wanted to finish it.

46:57.815 --> 46:58.984
Why do you care?

46:59.084 --> 47:04.355
What is it that you think
that you know about me?

47:04.455 --> 47:07.158
That you killed
Travis Weber.

47:07.258 --> 47:09.327
The better
I got to know Winter,

47:09.427 --> 47:11.997
the stranger Travis' death
seemed to me.

47:12.097 --> 47:14.765
It was expedient.
It was nonspecific.

47:14.866 --> 47:16.734
It was out-of-character
for him.

47:16.834 --> 47:18.669
It was not motivated
by any pathology

47:18.769 --> 47:20.872
but by self-preservation.

47:20.972 --> 47:22.840
But if it was you...

47:22.941 --> 47:27.345
**

47:27.445 --> 47:30.615
(breathes deeply)

47:31.782 --> 47:35.086
Poor Travis.
When he got out of the hospital,

47:35.186 --> 47:38.123
he was scared,
he wanted to leave town.

47:38.223 --> 47:40.458
So, someone
from the DA's office

47:40.558 --> 47:44.262
offered him a free plane ticket
and a ride to the airport.

47:45.563 --> 47:46.965
Was that the only time?

47:47.065 --> 47:48.599
Was wh the only time?

47:48.699 --> 47:50.969
That you were there,
with Winter.

47:51.069 --> 47:54.973
When something feels
that good,

47:55.073 --> 47:57.275
does a person ever
just do it once?

47:57.375 --> 47:58.776
No.

47:58.876 --> 48:01.779
Especially if it's part
of a shared psychosis.

48:05.883 --> 48:07.452
I'm sorry.

48:07.552 --> 48:09.120
What'd you call me?

48:09.220 --> 48:11.957
Folie à deux.

48:12.057 --> 48:14.659
Madness of two people.

48:14.759 --> 48:18.596
One individual is psychotic,
is dominant.

48:18.696 --> 48:21.899
The other one is suggestible,
susceptible.

48:22.000 --> 48:26.837
They're both operating
under the same delusion.

48:28.006 --> 48:31.776
Winter's madness drove him,
but you exploited it,

48:31.876 --> 48:35.846
you capitalized on his trauma
for your own purposes.

48:35.947 --> 48:36.982
He wanted to get out of it,

48:37.082 --> 48:38.583
but you made sure
that he wouldn't,

48:38.683 --> 48:41.953
couldn't,
all the way to the end.

48:42.053 --> 48:43.921
Why would I do that?

48:44.022 --> 48:46.324
Hmm?
Why would I do any of that?

48:46.424 --> 48:47.758
Because you wanted to.

48:47.858 --> 48:50.528
Because you like it.

48:50.628 --> 48:52.597
Because your entire
neural network

48:52.697 --> 48:55.133
is conditioned
to that now.

48:55.233 --> 48:57.535
When you were entrenched
with Winter,

48:57.635 --> 49:01.706
your reactions,
sexual and psychological,

49:01.806 --> 49:05.343
were all responses
of power and terror.

49:05.443 --> 49:08.879
Now he's gone.

49:08.980 --> 49:14.152
So you're alone with your
desires, your responses.

49:14.252 --> 49:16.821
**

49:16.921 --> 49:19.390
You're going to be staring
down the barrel

49:19.490 --> 49:20.891
of the rest of your life

49:20.992 --> 49:23.128
without anyone to help you
achieve them.

49:26.564 --> 49:28.833
What a thing it is,
in life,

49:28.933 --> 49:32.703
to find even one person who
understands your darkest heart,

49:32.803 --> 49:34.972
let alone two.

49:35.073 --> 49:36.574
You're right.

49:36.674 --> 49:39.010
He is gone.

49:39.110 --> 49:41.179
But I'm not alone.

49:41.279 --> 49:44.015
I wouldn't do that
to myself.

49:44.115 --> 49:45.316
Come on, doc.

49:45.416 --> 49:48.053
You think I don't know
how to plan for contingencies?

49:48.153 --> 49:52.490
You know, if there's one thing
that I've learned from my job,

49:52.590 --> 49:54.092
it's how to prepare,

49:54.192 --> 49:57.862
it's how to play
the long game, right?

49:57.962 --> 50:02.333
He is gone,
but I'm not alone.

50:02.433 --> 50:04.902
(echoing)
But I'm not alone.
But I'm not alone.

50:05.002 --> 50:08.039
The only real
folie à deux here

50:08.139 --> 50:10.508
is not between Winter and me.

50:10.608 --> 50:12.877
It's you and Winter, doc.

50:12.977 --> 50:15.113
And your shared delusion

50:15.213 --> 50:19.250
is that you told him
that he was worth helping.

50:20.751 --> 50:22.287
And he believed you.

50:22.387 --> 50:25.723
**

50:25.823 --> 50:28.126
(echoing) What is it that you
think you know about me?

50:30.228 --> 50:34.899
You know, if there's one thing
that I've learned from my job,

50:34.999 --> 50:37.034
it's how to prepare,

50:37.135 --> 50:39.870
it's how to play
the long game.

50:39.970 --> 50:41.606
(door closes)

50:41.706 --> 50:46.277
**

50:46.377 --> 50:49.414
Come on, doc, you think
I don't plan for contingencies?

50:52.583 --> 50:55.986
You're right. He is gone.

50:56.087 --> 50:57.888
But I'm not alone.

50:57.988 --> 51:04.262
**

51:04.362 --> 51:07.765
When something feels that good,

51:07.865 --> 51:10.668
does a person
ever just do it once?

51:12.837 --> 51:15.573
JUDGE MATHEWS: Mr. Jakes, have
you heard from your client?

51:15.673 --> 51:18.443
JAKES:
I spoke to him yesterday, at
which point he clearly stated

51:18.543 --> 51:20.010
he would be present
at today's hearing.

51:20.111 --> 51:21.646
Have you spoken
with him today?

51:21.746 --> 51:23.948
I have tried to reach him
repeatedly, Your Honor,

51:24.048 --> 51:26.751
but, as of yet,
I have not been able to.

51:26.851 --> 51:30.755
(indistinct talking)

51:30.855 --> 51:33.424
Then I have no choice but
to suspend my decision,

51:33.524 --> 51:35.126
levy a fine of $10,000,

51:35.226 --> 51:37.962
and issue a bench warrant
for Dr. Chance's arrest.

51:38.062 --> 51:40.431
(gavel bangs)

51:40.531 --> 51:43.368
**

51:43.468 --> 51:45.170
Hey.

51:45.270 --> 51:46.637
Where is he?

51:46.737 --> 51:52.177
**

51:52.277 --> 51:54.179
Shit.

51:58.816 --> 52:00.551
Just a scratch.

52:01.652 --> 52:03.788
Big scratch.

52:03.888 --> 52:06.857
Couple big scratches.

52:06.957 --> 52:09.227
So you finally
skipped bail, huh?

52:09.327 --> 52:11.696
You figure out a way
to get it right --

52:11.796 --> 52:13.898
what you did to society?

52:13.998 --> 52:15.700
**

52:15.800 --> 52:17.502
Sort of.

52:17.602 --> 52:21.005
Fuck's that mean?

52:21.105 --> 52:23.241
It means Lambert.

52:23.341 --> 52:25.976
He's not gonna stop.

52:26.076 --> 52:28.045
**

52:31.148 --> 52:37.021
**

52:37.121 --> 52:42.927
**

52:43.027 --> 52:48.866
**

52:48.966 --> 52:54.772
**

52:54.872 --> 53:00.678
**

53:00.778 --> 53:06.584
**

53:06.684 --> 53:12.523
**

53:12.623 --> 53:18.463
**

53:18.563 --> 53:24.402
**

53:24.502 --> 53:27.372
