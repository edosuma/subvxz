WEBVTT

00:59.526 --> 01:00.460
SUN-DONG

01:22.715 --> 01:24.551
I don't hear Sun-dong's voice.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.119
Is her microphone off?

01:26.419 --> 01:27.654
Then it's not a duet.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.422
Sun-dong is out.

02:26.746 --> 02:28.148
I'm out.

02:30.316 --> 02:31.551
I really hope you do well.

02:33.419 --> 02:34.354
Go, Hae-seong.

02:35.488 --> 02:36.322
Okay.

02:43.630 --> 02:44.797
She must be an idiot.

02:53.373 --> 02:54.440
Keep it together.

04:17.590 --> 04:18.625
Is it the sound crew's fault?

04:18.691 --> 04:20.760
She must not have checked the batteries.

04:23.429 --> 04:26.799
Principal Ju, do we have sound problems?
Shouldn't they restart?

04:27.133 --> 04:28.835
-Hold on.
-What?

05:58.691 --> 06:00.426
JUDGE

06:04.797 --> 06:05.698
Shin Hae-seong.

06:06.899 --> 06:09.135
Check and see if there are batteries.

06:27.720 --> 06:30.590
I would have given you another
chance had the microphone been broken,

06:31.524 --> 06:35.161
but you basically walked into
a battlefield without checking your ammo.

06:37.697 --> 06:38.564
Shin Hae-seong,

06:39.265 --> 06:40.166
you are out.

06:45.738 --> 06:47.440
Rian, you did a good job,

06:48.841 --> 06:50.176
however,

06:51.110 --> 06:52.111
you're out too.

07:06.692 --> 07:08.828
You should have handed
your mic to Hae-seong

07:08.895 --> 07:10.763
for her to sing her parts
in order to pull off a duet.

07:11.431 --> 07:15.268
You practically pushed her off the stage.
That's bad stage manners.

07:17.403 --> 07:18.237
Out.

07:56.676 --> 07:58.177
You took the batteries out, didn't you?

08:01.380 --> 08:02.215
What?

08:02.281 --> 08:04.250
We used the same mic.

08:04.917 --> 08:07.286
Why would the batteries
suddenly disappear?

08:08.621 --> 08:12.391
I saw you handing the mic to Hae-seong.

08:13.726 --> 08:16.829
Don't, Sun-dong. Please.

08:19.265 --> 08:20.333
Unbelievable.

08:25.471 --> 08:26.739
Why are you staring at me like that?

08:28.140 --> 08:30.176
You didn't have to do that.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.818
I want to be alone.

09:47.086 --> 09:47.987
Go away.

09:52.825 --> 09:54.093
Go away.

09:56.228 --> 09:57.163
Go!

10:01.100 --> 10:01.934
Fine.

10:03.202 --> 10:04.370
I did it.

10:06.772 --> 10:07.607
So what?

10:09.508 --> 10:11.510
What are you going to do about it?

10:17.717 --> 10:18.918
I know it wasn't you.

10:21.554 --> 10:24.690
I know you would never stoop that low.

10:26.859 --> 10:28.327
Why are you defending me?

10:32.565 --> 10:33.733
Just leave me alone.

10:36.268 --> 10:37.303
Go away.

11:26.652 --> 11:29.121
No wonder they call you a stalker.
You're always spying.

11:33.125 --> 11:34.660
What's there to see, anyway?

11:39.331 --> 11:40.299
Put your shoe on.

11:42.601 --> 11:43.769
I did it.

12:33.219 --> 12:34.720
Do I have to help you with your shoes now?

13:25.137 --> 13:27.106
That's Hong-ju's part.
Why is Na-na singing it all?

13:27.540 --> 13:31.177
Hong-ju must have volunteered
to stay quiet to make Na-na the star.

13:33.078 --> 13:34.980
How romantic.

14:25.130 --> 14:27.666
Forget about what happened today.

14:28.534 --> 14:30.336
This isn't the first time
things have been unfair.

14:31.670 --> 14:32.504
No.

14:33.906 --> 14:36.075
I'm going to remember every second of it.

14:38.611 --> 14:40.112
I grew up like a princess,

14:41.180 --> 14:44.116
so I had nothing to draw on
when it came to crying scenes.

14:47.686 --> 14:49.121
I'll remind myself of what happened today

14:50.522 --> 14:52.224
to nail the crying scenes.

14:56.695 --> 14:58.430
I'll consider this an acting lesson.

16:30.055 --> 16:31.256
What are you doing?

16:32.291 --> 16:33.559
What did I do?

16:37.396 --> 16:38.530
Stop, that's gross.

16:40.065 --> 16:41.934
It was the director who started

16:42.267 --> 16:45.070
this joke of making a super idol group
and making partners compete.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.078
What you did was nothing
compared to what that jerk did.

16:53.645 --> 16:57.416
Shin Hae-seong, you did well.
I feel so much better now.

16:57.916 --> 16:59.885
I'm not in the mood to joke around.

17:00.953 --> 17:02.588
Good grief.

17:12.498 --> 17:13.399
Found them.

17:14.266 --> 17:15.401
What are you doing?

17:22.708 --> 17:23.909
Rian is being falsely accused,

17:24.143 --> 17:26.545
and she will end up in the low-level class
all because of me.

17:27.846 --> 17:31.050
Are you going to tell the truth?

17:38.624 --> 17:42.361
But why are you taking
my side all of a sudden?

17:42.761 --> 17:43.595
What?

17:44.930 --> 17:47.032
You're worried about me.

17:48.200 --> 17:49.034
Gosh.

17:49.234 --> 17:50.702
Does it seem like I'm worried about you?

17:52.704 --> 17:53.672
Never mind then.

18:06.418 --> 18:07.553
I have something to tell you.

18:09.955 --> 18:12.458
Do you have evidence
that I messed with your mic?

18:12.791 --> 18:14.793
No, it's not that...

18:14.860 --> 18:17.396
Did you take out the batteries?

18:18.397 --> 18:19.231
What?

18:21.967 --> 18:24.636
Rian had no reason to do it.
She knew she would beat you.

18:25.637 --> 18:27.940
The batteries couldn't have slid out
on their own.

18:29.041 --> 18:30.476
-What is he implying?
-No way...

18:31.009 --> 18:34.346
Wasn't it you who took them out
because you got cold feet?

18:39.918 --> 18:42.588
If that's not the case,
I'm sorry, but if...

18:43.422 --> 18:46.859
-The thing is--
-Even if that is the case,

18:49.828 --> 18:52.231
all she needs to do is apologize.
What else do you expect her to do?

18:53.632 --> 18:55.267
Do you have proof that she took them out?

18:58.170 --> 19:01.840
Look at them.
They're set on framing Hae-seong.

19:02.608 --> 19:05.410
Don't you know Hae-seong
is the daughter of a pastor?

19:05.911 --> 19:07.279
-Of course, we do.
-Of course, we do.

19:11.350 --> 19:12.317
You really didn't do it?

19:12.918 --> 19:13.819
It's okay.

19:14.920 --> 19:15.821
That's enough.

19:28.967 --> 19:32.171
Mind your own business
and get ready for the performance.

19:34.239 --> 19:37.643
I hope you're not thinking of lip syncing.

19:38.977 --> 19:40.445
Don't embarrass me, all right?

20:10.609 --> 20:11.777
You've been practicing.

20:12.611 --> 20:14.413
What are you talking about?
I was just warming up.

20:16.915 --> 20:19.284
If you can't get into the rhythm
in the first place,

20:19.651 --> 20:22.354
you can't get yourself
to even start to dance.

20:23.222 --> 20:28.594
Novices like yourself
tend to freeze up on stage.

20:29.795 --> 20:30.629
Watch this.

20:40.372 --> 20:42.608
Do the same thing but with no basketball.

20:43.909 --> 20:46.144
Think of it as playing basketball
on stage.

20:48.614 --> 20:50.082
Yu-jin, you're up.

22:31.216 --> 22:33.385
Move. Don't get in the way.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.189
Do the same thing but with no basketball.

22:40.826 --> 22:41.827
Get out of the way.

22:53.071 --> 22:56.174
-Yu-jin!
-Yu-jin!

23:04.049 --> 23:06.651
-When did he learn to dance?
-He's good.

23:57.469 --> 23:58.670
Jin Yu-jin.

24:00.939 --> 24:01.840
You're out.

24:21.960 --> 24:26.498
Out with the director
for violating students' rights!

24:26.565 --> 24:28.233
-Out with him!
-Out with him!

24:28.300 --> 24:32.637
Out with Oz for violating
our children's human rights!

24:32.704 --> 24:34.506
-Out with Oz!
-Out with Oz!

24:34.573 --> 24:37.943
-Out with differentiated classes.
-Out!

24:38.009 --> 24:42.047
Out with the director
for violating students' rights!

24:42.113 --> 24:43.782
-Out with him!
-Out with him!

24:43.849 --> 24:47.118
Why are you violating the sanctity
of an educational institution?

24:47.185 --> 24:48.153
Goodness.

24:48.453 --> 24:50.388
The violation of students' rights...

24:51.957 --> 24:55.427
-Isn't that the principal?
-Where?

24:55.494 --> 24:57.729
-Do you call yourself a principal?
-Where's the director?

24:57.796 --> 25:00.098
-Where is he?
-Step down!

25:00.532 --> 25:03.835
-How can you let this happen?
-This isn't a school.

25:04.503 --> 25:07.539
Excuse me. Please, everyone.

25:07.873 --> 25:11.176
You shouldn't be doing this.
What would the students learn?

25:11.243 --> 25:14.513
He's the principal, for crying out loud.

25:14.579 --> 25:15.647
"Principal"?

25:15.714 --> 25:18.517
My son is being forced
to transfer to another school

25:18.583 --> 25:20.285
for going out with a girl.

25:20.352 --> 25:22.320
What kind of teacher does that?

25:22.721 --> 25:25.390
You put my daughter
in that low-level class, didn't you?

25:25.991 --> 25:28.660
Now, please calm down.

25:29.160 --> 25:31.630
-The authority of teachers--
-Who are you, anyway?

25:32.163 --> 25:33.965
-Get lost.
-Get out of our way.

25:40.605 --> 25:41.606
Oh, Lord.

25:43.208 --> 25:46.111
Now, calm down! Please!

25:46.745 --> 25:48.046
Is this the best you can do?

25:48.480 --> 25:51.349
If you're going to protest,
you should do it right.

25:51.917 --> 25:54.753
Do you think picketing will bring change?

25:55.520 --> 25:56.488
Come on now.

25:57.556 --> 26:03.295
Why don't you come to my office
later this afternoon?

26:03.695 --> 26:06.364
If you're going to protest, you should
do it right. This won't change things.

26:06.431 --> 26:09.634
-What is this?
-Please make way.

26:09.701 --> 26:11.036
He's so shameless.

26:11.102 --> 26:12.437
You should go inside. It's cold out.

26:32.057 --> 26:33.325
Gosh.

26:38.863 --> 26:40.565
Don't worry about her. Don't worry.

26:41.499 --> 26:45.003
We're only separated
for supplementary classes,

26:45.070 --> 26:46.738
so it shouldn't be bad, right?

26:46.805 --> 26:48.540
-I'm sure it'll be fine.
-I hope so.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.308
I'm more worried about the dorm.

26:50.942 --> 26:52.510
Will they really kick us out?

26:53.945 --> 26:55.747
My dad will throw a fit if he finds out.

26:57.682 --> 26:59.784
Shin Hae-seong, your dad's here.

27:00.051 --> 27:01.620
-What?
-Oh, boy.

27:02.754 --> 27:05.056
Could you just pretend you didn't see me--

27:05.123 --> 27:07.826
Mr. Shin, she's here.

27:11.830 --> 27:12.797
Dad.

27:25.110 --> 27:28.079
Students assigned to the low-level class,
get on the bus.

27:30.482 --> 27:31.316
-Us?
-Us?

27:31.983 --> 27:34.285
-Go.
-But we have a class...

27:34.352 --> 27:35.987
-Let's go.
-Where are we going?

27:37.188 --> 27:39.290
-Where are we going?
-Come on. Let's go.

27:45.330 --> 27:47.966
Dad, I have to get on the bus.

27:48.299 --> 27:51.336
I brought you some apples
to share with your friends--

27:51.403 --> 27:53.405
Just leave them.
Someone will take them for you.

27:53.471 --> 27:54.372
Wait,

27:54.873 --> 27:57.942
did they really separate you
into accelerated and low-level classes--

27:58.009 --> 28:01.579
If I miss the bus, there's no hope, Dad.

28:01.780 --> 28:02.714
I have to run.

28:04.816 --> 28:07.585
And next time, call before you come.

28:07.819 --> 28:09.454
The schedule here is really off the wall.

28:09.521 --> 28:10.355
Okay?

28:10.422 --> 28:12.457
Goodbye.

28:14.459 --> 28:16.895
Hae-seong! The apples...

28:17.328 --> 28:18.329
Who are you?

28:19.464 --> 28:20.899
Express delivery?

28:21.766 --> 28:22.667
What?

28:24.436 --> 28:26.237
-What are you doing?
-Let's go.

28:26.304 --> 28:27.839
Are we being taken to a slaughterhouse?

28:30.675 --> 28:31.743
"Slaughterhouse"?

28:32.711 --> 28:34.946
-We don't have all day.
-Wait.

28:35.747 --> 28:36.848
Where are we going?

28:37.782 --> 28:39.284
Ms. Hyeon!

28:47.325 --> 28:48.460
Where are they taking them?

29:01.339 --> 29:03.742
The fresh smell of nature.

29:04.442 --> 29:06.277
The air is so fresh.

29:13.485 --> 29:14.586
Listen up!

29:15.353 --> 29:19.791
You will now experience hell.

29:38.743 --> 29:39.844
JB!

29:42.113 --> 29:44.082
-I know what happened.
-About what?

29:44.149 --> 29:47.118
I'm sure Rian was taken to that place.

29:47.886 --> 29:50.555
The place they took us
when we were trainees.

29:53.191 --> 29:54.192
Don't you remember?

29:54.659 --> 29:57.228
The creepy-looking drill sergeant.
Ring any bells?

29:58.429 --> 29:59.430
No way.

30:05.537 --> 30:09.707
-Psy!
-Psy!

30:09.774 --> 30:14.679
-Psy!
-Psy!

30:14.746 --> 30:16.014
-Psy!
-Psy!

30:16.681 --> 30:18.383
Are you giving us a lesson?

30:19.050 --> 30:21.853
Aren't you too busy
to be doing something like this?

30:22.453 --> 30:23.755
Oz does get the best people for us.

30:24.355 --> 30:25.690
To the training ground.

30:26.124 --> 30:29.127
Counting only the first ten
who gets there.

30:30.562 --> 30:31.563
Run!

30:33.331 --> 30:34.732
-What's he talking about?
-I knew it.

30:53.051 --> 30:55.420
You are racehorses.

30:55.720 --> 30:57.722
Racehorses!

30:58.122 --> 31:00.859
Run!

31:00.925 --> 31:01.826
BOOT CAMP

31:01.893 --> 31:03.228
DO OR DIE

31:05.063 --> 31:06.831
Our dear Rian is back.

31:07.699 --> 31:09.467
You might make a career out of this.

31:15.039 --> 31:21.713
Put your most prized possession
into the basket.

31:22.146 --> 31:23.114
Start now.

31:26.017 --> 31:29.087
I'm not who you think I am,

31:31.089 --> 31:33.925
nor am I an impersonator
who does B-grade club shows.

31:35.360 --> 31:36.327
Aggressively,

31:36.928 --> 31:37.996
and with great intensity...

31:43.134 --> 31:46.004
I will breathe new life into you.

31:46.871 --> 31:49.073
Human rehabilitation.

31:50.074 --> 31:54.712
Until each of you are reborn,
no one's leaving this boot camp.

31:55.747 --> 31:57.482
And if you somehow manage
to weasel yourself out,

31:59.050 --> 32:00.351
you may end up coming back.

32:03.321 --> 32:06.491
Your prized possessions will now be hidden

32:06.557 --> 32:11.396
in every nook and cranny
of this campground.

32:11.462 --> 32:12.397
What?

32:13.398 --> 32:15.133
Are you out of your mind?

32:15.967 --> 32:18.403
Don't tell me you just tried
to start a conversation with me.

32:19.938 --> 32:22.273
I need my notebook back. I can't lose it.

32:22.540 --> 32:25.176
-You are not in a regular society.
-Then am I in the military?

32:25.610 --> 32:27.578
Your state of mind is rotten to the core.

32:29.480 --> 32:32.216
-Yours, too.
-Yes, sir.

32:33.351 --> 32:36.988
-When a friend does wrong,
-When a friend does wrong,

32:37.055 --> 32:40.458
-I've done wrong.
-I've done wrong.

32:41.125 --> 32:45.563
-When a friend does wrong,
-When a friend does wrong,

32:45.863 --> 32:49.467
-I've done wrong.
-I've done wrong.

32:49.534 --> 32:51.102
Training is self-service.

32:51.536 --> 32:55.039
All you have to do is get through
a few training and obstacle courses

32:55.106 --> 32:59.344
to find the hidden possessions
and return them to their owners.

33:00.144 --> 33:03.081
Until the very last item
is found and returned,

33:03.448 --> 33:06.551
no one is leaving this camp.

33:07.018 --> 33:10.388
He calls this simple training? Good grief.

33:11.255 --> 33:14.092
A student spoke without being spoken to.

33:14.425 --> 33:16.728
Do ten squats. Go.

33:17.161 --> 33:19.397
-Jeez.
-No way.

33:21.866 --> 33:24.669
-When a friend
-When a friend

33:25.703 --> 33:27.538
-does wrong,
-does wrong,

33:28.773 --> 33:32.710
-I've done wrong.
-I've done wrong.

33:33.778 --> 33:37.682
-When a friend does wrong,
-When a friend does wrong,

33:38.783 --> 33:41.285
-I've...
-What's the matter?

33:41.352 --> 33:44.956
-Rian, wake up.
-What's the matter?

33:45.623 --> 33:46.824
-What's wrong?
-Rian!

33:46.891 --> 33:48.359
-Rian.
-Hey, are you okay?

33:48.426 --> 33:51.195
-Are you okay?
-Wake up, Rian.

33:51.629 --> 33:55.266
Rian!

33:58.803 --> 34:00.104
What a shame.

34:01.572 --> 34:04.542
Our dear Rian's acting
hasn't improved at all.

34:05.743 --> 34:08.146
Just awful. Listen up, everyone.

34:08.212 --> 34:12.884
You're currently witnessing
the epitome of bad acting.

34:13.284 --> 34:17.288
Look at the way her legs
are perfectly aligned

34:17.355 --> 34:19.991
to execute the princess-in-distress look.

34:20.058 --> 34:22.226
Her eyes are moving nervously
under her eyelids.

34:24.962 --> 34:26.898
You may end up coming here
a third time, Rian.

34:28.266 --> 34:29.934
We have to set this right.
Give me 50 squats.

34:30.001 --> 34:30.835
Go!

34:32.070 --> 34:35.673
-Darn it.
-Jeez.

34:44.816 --> 34:47.218
Sun-dong, you are doing it great.

34:47.785 --> 34:49.921
A bit more. We can do this.

34:49.987 --> 34:52.457
Just a bit more. One more step.

34:54.225 --> 34:55.660
I made it!

34:58.496 --> 34:59.363
-Seven.
-Seven.

35:00.598 --> 35:01.466
-Eight.
-Eight.

35:02.934 --> 35:03.768
-Nine.
-Nine.

35:05.136 --> 35:05.970
-Ten.
-Ten.

35:07.305 --> 35:08.172
-Eleven.
-Eleven.

35:09.474 --> 35:10.475
-Twelve.
-Twelve.

35:11.109 --> 35:14.078
I'm aware that there are many problems
with the school as it currently stands.

35:14.345 --> 35:15.980
But what power do I, the principal, have?

35:16.214 --> 35:18.749
I don't own the school.
Who owns it, you ask?

35:18.816 --> 35:20.918
That's right. It's the students.

35:21.285 --> 35:25.556
We should demand that the school
be returned to the students.

35:25.623 --> 35:26.457
Who should we talk to?

35:26.524 --> 35:27.725
The foundation? No.

35:28.359 --> 35:29.327
As I've already told you,

35:29.393 --> 35:33.698
the Office of Education
and millions of netizens will support you.

35:33.764 --> 35:36.200
-What is he saying?
-What?

35:36.267 --> 35:38.402
At a time like this,

35:38.469 --> 35:42.039
we should work together
to speak in a unified voice

35:42.106 --> 35:42.940
to get the school...

35:45.943 --> 35:46.777
Well...

35:48.412 --> 35:50.448
the parents and I were
in the middle of a talk about...

35:50.882 --> 35:51.849
Oh, okay.

35:55.253 --> 35:58.689
Hello, I'm Lee Gang-cheol,
the director of the foundation.

36:01.292 --> 36:04.996
I'm very well aware why you're all here.

36:06.664 --> 36:07.899
I know how worried you are.

36:10.835 --> 36:12.970
I'll cut to the chase.

36:14.338 --> 36:17.608
We have no desire to work with students

36:19.143 --> 36:23.447
who do not wish to follow
our school's rules and regulations.

36:24.515 --> 36:29.453
That's not what Principal Ju
was saying just now.

36:32.156 --> 36:33.057
Similar though.

36:35.927 --> 36:39.597
Let's say your children
have been thrown into the sea.

36:41.165 --> 36:42.433
I have to pull them out,

36:43.234 --> 36:47.004
but I can't swim out to the deep sea

36:47.705 --> 36:50.441
to grab every single one of them.

36:51.709 --> 36:55.580
I have to pull out
those who are within my grasp first.

36:55.947 --> 36:56.781
So,

36:57.481 --> 37:00.952
you'll abandon those kids
who have fallen to the very bottom?

37:01.719 --> 37:03.454
Nobody can help them.

37:04.889 --> 37:07.124
It's up to them
to do what it takes to survive.

37:08.059 --> 37:11.796
That's why we separated the kids
into different classes

37:12.897 --> 37:14.765
and sent them to boot camp
to equip them for survival.

37:15.633 --> 37:17.935
If they have any drive,
they'll do what they have to.

37:18.436 --> 37:21.839
And if they don't,
this isn't meant for them.

37:22.907 --> 37:24.475
But I'll promise you this.

37:25.576 --> 37:28.012
If they manage to get themselves
within my grasp,

37:30.181 --> 37:31.549
I will definitely...

37:32.817 --> 37:33.951
pull them out of the water.

37:43.294 --> 37:44.629
This is absurd.

37:47.198 --> 37:48.032
Hey.

37:51.168 --> 37:54.005
This is gross. It tastes like cardboard.

37:54.472 --> 37:56.574
There's no place like home.

37:57.408 --> 38:00.511
The old adage really resonates
with me now.

38:00.645 --> 38:02.413
What did we do to deserve this?

38:02.880 --> 38:06.050
This is all Principal Ju's fault.

38:06.350 --> 38:08.452
He's the one who outed us.

38:09.487 --> 38:11.956
He's always catering
to the director's every whim.

39:04.308 --> 39:05.576
Rise and shine.

39:06.310 --> 39:08.179
Rise and shine.

39:09.280 --> 39:14.285
Rise and shine!

39:18.422 --> 39:19.256
Hey.

39:19.790 --> 39:21.892
You look so ordinary without your makeup.

39:23.594 --> 39:25.830
Don't put your makeup on.
It makes you look like a witch.

39:38.676 --> 39:40.611
There's a little swing set

39:41.912 --> 39:43.414
near the back of the training ground.

39:44.815 --> 39:46.684
There should be a treasure box there.

39:48.519 --> 39:49.987
We found one there last time.

39:52.390 --> 39:53.991
Go and get it.

39:54.492 --> 39:56.260
Why can't you?

39:57.027 --> 39:59.630
I'm telling you
because I don't feel like going.

40:01.232 --> 40:03.467
You don't want to be stuck in this camp
any longer, do you?

40:27.792 --> 40:29.760
Where's the treasure box
she was talking about?

40:55.453 --> 41:00.224
I looked around the swing set,
but there was nothing there.

41:01.692 --> 41:03.461
-Can't you read the sign?
-What?

41:05.796 --> 41:06.964
NOT FOR USE BY TWO OR MORE PEOPLE

41:07.765 --> 41:08.599
Oh, right.

41:11.502 --> 41:13.204
Hey! It's swaying.

41:15.706 --> 41:16.574
Sorry.

41:21.111 --> 41:23.581
You always cause trouble
and then say you're sorry.

41:25.716 --> 41:27.618
I'm only going through this crap
because of you.

41:33.958 --> 41:35.392
If you're really sorry,

41:36.293 --> 41:38.062
stay far away from me.

41:40.097 --> 41:40.931
Okay.

41:41.832 --> 41:42.867
I'll get going.

41:58.516 --> 41:59.517
Rian!

42:01.585 --> 42:02.453
Hey!

42:05.222 --> 42:06.090
Are you okay?

42:06.524 --> 42:07.591
Wake up.

42:27.611 --> 42:33.017
-Twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five...
-Violating a safety regulation here

42:33.083 --> 42:35.886
is like bungee jumping
after cutting the bungee cord.

42:35.953 --> 42:37.421
-Understood?
-Twenty-eight,

42:37.955 --> 42:42.026
twenty-nine, thirty, thirty-one--

42:42.860 --> 42:46.931
Where is your focus?
You do not call out the 30th.

42:46.997 --> 42:49.133
Another thirty. Go!

42:49.800 --> 42:54.238
Three, four, five...

42:55.005 --> 42:57.575
...twenty-nine, thirty.

43:01.478 --> 43:03.514
Fifty. Go!

43:03.981 --> 43:06.884
Is Rian seriously injured? Did she hurt
her neck or something like that?

43:07.418 --> 43:08.953
Is she really okay?

43:10.154 --> 43:12.556
Shouldn't we take her to the hospital?

43:13.090 --> 43:15.459
One hundred! Go!

43:18.128 --> 43:20.731
One, two...

43:21.532 --> 43:26.103
...thirty-one, thirty-two, thirty-three...

43:26.904 --> 43:31.642
...fifty-five, fifty-six, fifty-seven...

43:58.035 --> 43:58.869
Was that...

44:00.838 --> 44:03.841
Was that another acting stunt of yours?

44:04.241 --> 44:06.377
I always do better on retakes.

44:06.877 --> 44:08.779
Do you have any idea how worried I was?

44:11.849 --> 44:13.317
Am I supposed to feel bad?

44:14.952 --> 44:15.786
No.

44:17.888 --> 44:20.190
I won't feel bad
about what I've done to you,

44:21.892 --> 44:23.727
so don't feel bad
about what you've done to me.

44:26.397 --> 44:28.098
What have you done to me?

44:30.000 --> 44:31.568
You took out the batteries,

44:32.336 --> 44:33.570
didn't you?

44:34.571 --> 44:35.506
No.

44:36.640 --> 44:37.641
You really didn't?

44:38.909 --> 44:40.344
Don't dump that on me.

45:02.099 --> 45:03.033
Let's go.

45:04.868 --> 45:05.703
Where to?

45:05.836 --> 45:06.870
To get Rian.

45:07.137 --> 45:09.006
How are we going to get there
at this hour?

45:13.177 --> 45:14.344
We'll take Ms. Ahn's car.

45:15.312 --> 45:16.847
It was in her office.

45:17.514 --> 45:18.816
I don't think she'll be back tonight.

45:18.882 --> 45:21.618
She wasn't around all day,
and it's almost curfew.

45:22.920 --> 45:24.254
Aren't you worried about Rian?

45:25.255 --> 45:27.224
I know you still have feelings for her.

45:29.393 --> 45:32.062
You're the only one
who has a driver's license.

45:32.129 --> 45:32.996
Come on.

45:45.375 --> 45:49.279
We've had a lot to drink.
We should get going.

45:49.680 --> 45:51.148
You know what?

45:51.982 --> 45:55.352
I really try hard to avoid eating sea eel.

45:56.587 --> 45:57.621
Do you know why?

45:58.822 --> 46:03.093
Because it's so delicious.

46:03.994 --> 46:07.765
Once I start eating it, I can't stop.

46:08.398 --> 46:09.600
Ultimately,

46:12.102 --> 46:13.403
I end up gaining weight.

46:17.007 --> 46:18.108
But...

46:20.177 --> 46:21.245
today,

46:22.079 --> 46:25.983
I'm so heartbroken

46:27.217 --> 46:28.986
that I need to comfort myself

46:30.087 --> 46:33.123
with yummy sea eel.

46:40.397 --> 46:41.665
Oh, no.

46:44.301 --> 46:46.637
Come on. How will you face us tomorrow?

46:48.806 --> 46:52.976
Why didn't you hold the director back
like you're doing to me right now?

46:55.712 --> 46:57.214
Sugar cube.

47:00.384 --> 47:01.218
Excuse me?

47:01.285 --> 47:05.355
You sent our kids to hell.

47:10.561 --> 47:13.230
And you took the accelerated class.

47:13.764 --> 47:16.500
Why do I get the low-level class?

47:17.167 --> 47:19.236
Does that make any sense?

47:19.303 --> 47:20.404
Isn't it ludicrous?

47:20.470 --> 47:23.173
She's very drunk. She's too drink.

47:25.008 --> 47:27.010
Stop whining.

47:28.779 --> 47:29.613
What?

47:31.281 --> 47:32.549
Come on, Ms. Hyeon.

47:32.616 --> 47:34.084
That's a bit...

47:35.652 --> 47:38.155
You sound like a mosquito. A mosquito.

47:40.891 --> 47:41.892
Do I...

47:43.427 --> 47:44.795
sound like a mosquito?

47:45.562 --> 47:47.397
No way.

47:48.198 --> 47:50.634
No, she wanted to know
if you liked mojitos.

47:51.134 --> 47:54.071
-She called me a mosquito.
-Mosquito? No way.

47:54.504 --> 47:57.307
Your whiny voice
calls for an insect repellent.

48:09.486 --> 48:10.687
Ms. Hyeon?

48:17.094 --> 48:19.062
There must be negative energy
lingering at Kirin.

48:19.897 --> 48:21.665
No one's normal.

48:22.266 --> 48:24.001
Am I like a mosquito to you?

48:30.274 --> 48:31.875
MR. LEE

48:33.911 --> 48:34.811
Yes, Mr. Lee.

48:36.546 --> 48:37.381
Really?

48:38.548 --> 48:39.816
I'll be right there.

48:42.052 --> 48:43.420
Sugar cube!

48:43.987 --> 48:46.356
Don't run away!

48:49.860 --> 48:50.761
I won.

48:52.129 --> 48:53.697
I won.

48:57.434 --> 48:59.336
I won,

48:59.736 --> 49:02.906
so the drinks are on you.

49:04.741 --> 49:06.109
I won.

49:11.848 --> 49:13.550
I won.

49:34.771 --> 49:35.605
Seul.

49:39.076 --> 49:40.978
I can go now, right? My guardian's here.

49:43.413 --> 49:44.548
You're not going anywhere.

49:46.149 --> 49:47.284
Are you her guardian?

49:50.721 --> 49:52.356
You reek of booze.

49:55.258 --> 49:56.159
Sorry.

49:57.327 --> 49:58.562
You don't have to be sorry.

49:59.563 --> 50:00.530
Let's go.

50:03.400 --> 50:04.701
Hey, kid!

50:09.006 --> 50:09.840
Listen up.

50:11.241 --> 50:12.576
Who made me an outsider?

50:13.577 --> 50:14.444
You guys, right?

50:15.679 --> 50:17.280
Who tried to take my money?

50:18.582 --> 50:19.583
You guys, right?

50:21.485 --> 50:23.120
And who was it that threw the first punch?

50:24.321 --> 50:25.288
You guys, right?

50:26.089 --> 50:27.024
Don't look me in the eye.

50:30.060 --> 50:30.961
Listen, lady.

50:31.795 --> 50:33.530
Do a better job of raising your daughter.

50:34.765 --> 50:35.766
My goodness.

50:53.350 --> 50:54.384
Thanks.

50:54.684 --> 50:56.520
Don't mention it. Drive safely.

51:07.097 --> 51:08.165
I want to go to Mom.

51:08.999 --> 51:10.100
Let me go to Australia.

51:11.301 --> 51:13.937
You're a loner
because you always beat kids up.

51:14.404 --> 51:16.306
I beat them up because they shun me.

51:18.442 --> 51:20.644
I suppose it's better
than getting beaten up.

51:23.914 --> 51:25.182
Let me go to Australia.

51:33.523 --> 51:37.594
You will now think about
how indebted you are to your parents.

51:38.061 --> 51:41.131
Go into the very depths of your soul

51:41.431 --> 51:44.434
and write a letter to your parents now.

51:45.735 --> 51:48.472
Who is it that turned
your parents' hair gray?

51:48.538 --> 51:52.375
Who is it that made their shoulders droop?

51:52.442 --> 51:55.712
The wrinkles of age
on their hands and face...

51:56.179 --> 51:57.547
Who's responsible for them?

51:57.848 --> 51:59.416
Me? You?

52:00.117 --> 52:01.251
We all caused our parents grief.

52:01.585 --> 52:06.356
Like the ashes and soot of this campfire,
we have charred our parents' hearts.

52:06.423 --> 52:08.625
All because we never listened to them.

52:12.696 --> 52:13.530
Are you welling up?

52:15.132 --> 52:16.099
You're allowed to cry.

52:17.200 --> 52:18.635
I'm welling up as well.

52:20.604 --> 52:21.571
Don't hold back your tears.

52:23.473 --> 52:27.811
Think about your parents
and what they've sacrificed for you.

52:28.545 --> 52:30.480
Our beloved parents...

52:30.847 --> 52:31.815
Let's all say it together.

52:31.882 --> 52:37.020
-Our beloved parents.
-"Our beloved parents."

52:37.087 --> 52:41.491
-Our beloved parents.
-"Our beloved parents."

52:42.425 --> 52:45.128
Let's say it one more time.
Our beloved parents.

52:45.495 --> 52:47.297
-Our beloved parents.
-Good grief.

52:47.931 --> 52:51.201
-"Our beloved parents."
-"Our beloved parents."

52:56.206 --> 52:57.574
Hello.

53:02.312 --> 53:04.214
Who do we have here?
You've decided to come back?

53:05.815 --> 53:08.818
Once in a blue moon,
we get volunteer returnees like this.

53:10.687 --> 53:13.557
I doubt that. It's nice to see you again.

53:14.391 --> 53:16.326
Not bad.

53:16.393 --> 53:18.495
You can lie with a straight face now.

53:18.562 --> 53:20.163
It's all thanks to you, sir.

53:20.630 --> 53:24.034
We got worried about our friends.
So, we're here for a visitation.

53:24.901 --> 53:26.703
Where's Rian?

53:38.148 --> 53:39.449
Where is she?

53:43.887 --> 53:44.788
She's not here?

53:45.322 --> 53:48.792
Isn't it common sense
to follow safety regulations?

53:52.229 --> 53:53.730
It was a slipup.

53:54.631 --> 53:56.233
She's very sorry as it is.

53:56.299 --> 53:57.867
Must you make her feel worse?

53:58.335 --> 53:59.336
Slipup?

54:00.770 --> 54:03.006
Are you sure it was just a slipup?

54:04.374 --> 54:05.408
What are you implying?

54:06.977 --> 54:07.877
Who knows?

54:08.712 --> 54:10.647
She may have wanted
something bad to happen to Rian.

54:11.414 --> 54:12.882
What's up with you?

54:14.251 --> 54:18.788
You don't know how I feel,
so that was uncalled for.

54:19.823 --> 54:24.527
You don't care
how hurtful your words can be, do you?

54:25.595 --> 54:29.733
Since you have loving fans,
love must not mean much to you.

54:31.601 --> 54:33.470
But one of your fans left you today.

54:35.839 --> 54:36.673
From now on,

54:37.807 --> 54:38.842
I'm not your fan anymore.

54:47.017 --> 54:48.218
Wow, Shin Hae-seong.

54:49.185 --> 54:50.520
Boot camp did wonders for her.

54:56.693 --> 54:58.828
How do you feel about losing a fan?

54:59.963 --> 55:01.064
Jeez, fine.

55:01.464 --> 55:03.967
Shouldn't we look for Rian?
It's getting late.

55:06.369 --> 55:09.306
You two stay here.
I think I know where she is.

55:25.188 --> 55:27.390
Where are those stupid treasure boxes?

55:29.326 --> 55:31.494
I need to find them all
by the end of the night.

55:34.164 --> 55:36.433
I can do it.

55:37.033 --> 55:37.867
Yes, I can.

55:46.509 --> 55:48.044
Where in the world is she?

56:16.639 --> 56:18.007
What are you doing here?

56:19.943 --> 56:22.445
-You must be okay.
-What?

56:23.880 --> 56:25.181
Why are you here?

56:28.118 --> 56:29.753
It's not what you're thinking.

56:32.222 --> 56:34.758
I thought maybe they had hid
a treasure box here like last time.

56:39.729 --> 56:41.931
You should go.

56:47.737 --> 56:49.406
I'm embarrassed, so just go.

57:01.951 --> 57:02.886
We found it!

57:03.553 --> 57:04.387
What is it?

57:07.490 --> 57:08.324
Ta-da.

57:09.859 --> 57:10.827
What's that?

57:11.127 --> 57:12.562
My most prized possession.

57:14.464 --> 57:15.565
These belong to you?

57:17.767 --> 57:20.937
Yes, it's the first pair I wore out
from training and dancing.

57:25.542 --> 57:26.376
It's a present.

57:33.316 --> 57:34.517
I have nine more pairs to go.

57:35.285 --> 57:38.721
I'll make my debut by the time
I wear out nine more pairs.

57:42.592 --> 57:44.294
This is the first pair.

57:45.462 --> 57:48.765
I'll also give you one of the second pair,
the third pair, and so on.

57:51.301 --> 57:52.502
Like couples have matching rings.

58:05.515 --> 58:07.917
This is just trash. Give me a break.

58:08.885 --> 58:12.388
But it symbolizes
all my hard work and passion.

58:15.525 --> 58:16.359
Forget it.

59:15.919 --> 59:17.120
You suck.

59:19.122 --> 59:19.956
What?

59:25.461 --> 59:26.396
You...

59:29.265 --> 59:30.433
really suck.

59:39.175 --> 59:41.177
What are you doing?

59:45.848 --> 59:47.417
I'm helping you

59:48.918 --> 59:50.386
wearing out the next nine pairs.

1:00:04.067 --> 1:00:05.134
Do you have something to say?

1:00:06.836 --> 1:00:07.670
No.

1:00:13.276 --> 1:00:14.210
Me neither.

1:00:16.613 --> 1:00:17.513
Do you...

1:00:20.817 --> 1:00:24.020
still have the nine sneakers I gave you?

1:00:29.726 --> 1:00:30.893
Why do you want to know?

1:00:59.956 --> 1:01:00.890
Shin Hae-seong!

1:01:02.158 --> 1:01:03.192
Shin Hae-seong!

1:01:04.027 --> 1:01:05.194
Gosh.

1:01:06.396 --> 1:01:07.530
Shin Hae-seong!

1:01:08.698 --> 1:01:10.266
Where the heck is she?

1:01:11.300 --> 1:01:12.669
Shin Hae-seong!

1:01:28.051 --> 1:01:28.885
I found it.

1:01:34.791 --> 1:01:36.092
How many have you guys found?

1:01:39.395 --> 1:01:41.831
Why are you meddling in affairs
of the low-level class?

1:01:42.632 --> 1:01:43.900
Mind your own business.

1:01:45.301 --> 1:01:46.903
You can end the search in an hour.

1:01:47.637 --> 1:01:48.938
Should I still mind my own business?

1:01:50.373 --> 1:01:51.374
-Really?
-Are you serious?

1:01:53.976 --> 1:01:55.078
We have four more to go.

1:01:57.113 --> 1:01:58.247
These are the ones we've found.

1:01:59.749 --> 1:02:01.951
Get four of these boxes.

1:02:02.685 --> 1:02:03.820
They should be in the office.

1:02:06.089 --> 1:02:07.824
Put in anything into each box
and hand them in.

1:02:08.324 --> 1:02:09.592
The drill sergeant has no idea

1:02:09.726 --> 1:02:11.661
what you put in that basket
in the first place.

1:02:12.662 --> 1:02:17.333
He isn't stupid enough
not to have checked beforehand.

1:02:19.068 --> 1:02:21.070
You have nothing to lose
by trying it though.

1:02:23.973 --> 1:02:26.209
I'll get the boxes.

1:02:49.766 --> 1:02:52.902
FROM SHIN HAE-SEONG TO SHIN SANG-HYEOK

1:02:58.040 --> 1:02:58.875
Found it.

1:03:04.046 --> 1:03:06.649
-What is that?
-Nothing.

1:03:33.376 --> 1:03:34.443
I found it!

1:03:47.657 --> 1:03:48.825
Jeez, Shin Hae-seong!

1:03:52.094 --> 1:03:53.329
What are you doing here?

1:03:54.397 --> 1:03:57.133
-I looked all over for you.
-Why?

1:03:58.100 --> 1:03:59.635
Anyway, let's get back.

1:04:00.336 --> 1:04:01.938
All right. Hold your horses.

1:04:02.205 --> 1:04:03.406
Mama's coming.

1:04:03.773 --> 1:04:04.907
Mama, my foot.

1:04:07.376 --> 1:04:08.511
Hey, are you okay?

1:04:16.752 --> 1:04:18.387
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

1:04:25.561 --> 1:04:26.495
That was fun.

1:04:27.663 --> 1:04:28.497
What?

1:04:29.866 --> 1:04:31.367
Should I fall again?

1:04:31.834 --> 1:04:32.802
My gosh.

1:04:47.717 --> 1:04:49.952
There are so many stars.

1:04:52.421 --> 1:04:53.522
Look at that.

1:04:54.156 --> 1:04:58.728
Doesn't that giant star
look fat and yummy?

1:05:01.197 --> 1:05:05.167
I bet it's crispy on the outside,
and when you bite into it,

1:05:05.234 --> 1:05:10.339
it will explode in your mouth
and give you a good singing voice.

1:05:17.914 --> 1:05:20.650
Oh, right. I found the last four boxes.

1:05:24.754 --> 1:05:25.688
Ta-da.

1:05:27.723 --> 1:05:28.557
This is mine.

1:05:29.225 --> 1:05:30.793
You've been running around
to look for these?

1:05:31.494 --> 1:05:32.328
Yes.

1:05:33.262 --> 1:05:34.563
All alone?

1:05:37.900 --> 1:05:39.402
I wanted to be of some help.

1:05:42.872 --> 1:05:43.940
Otherwise,

1:05:45.708 --> 1:05:47.576
I would have felt
really pathetic about myself.

1:05:56.185 --> 1:05:57.320
It's a composition notebook.

1:05:57.920 --> 1:05:59.055
Give that back.

1:06:03.559 --> 1:06:07.396
-Only if you sing me a song.
-What?

1:06:08.030 --> 1:06:09.565
Sing just one song.

1:06:11.000 --> 1:06:13.502
If you don't want to sing one of yours,
sing anything.

1:06:14.337 --> 1:06:16.205
I don't sing for just anyone.

1:06:17.273 --> 1:06:18.107
Forget about it.

1:06:19.175 --> 1:06:20.409
But you're a good singer.

1:06:22.745 --> 1:06:25.581
If I could sing as well as you,

1:06:27.249 --> 1:06:30.019
I'd sing for everyone and anyone
every single day.

1:06:32.021 --> 1:06:32.855
Please?

1:06:33.756 --> 1:06:34.657
Just one song.

1:08:11.187 --> 1:08:12.121
Let's see.

1:08:12.188 --> 1:08:13.522
This should fit you perfectly.

1:08:13.589 --> 1:08:15.825
It'll look great on you.

1:08:16.692 --> 1:08:17.726
Isn't it great?

1:08:18.160 --> 1:08:19.628
Look, it looks great.

1:08:19.695 --> 1:08:20.529
Here, try it on.

1:08:23.766 --> 1:08:25.868
Come on, try it on just once.

1:08:28.237 --> 1:08:29.238
Gosh.

1:08:30.306 --> 1:08:31.340
Oh, well.

1:09:00.402 --> 1:09:01.504
I...

1:09:02.938 --> 1:09:05.040
wanted to be a singer.

1:09:07.943 --> 1:09:08.944
Me too.
