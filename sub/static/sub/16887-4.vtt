00:01.500 --> 00:03.000
who'd like
to dedicate this next song

00:03.000 --> 00:05.600
to the James Buchanan
varsity football team.

00:05.600 --> 00:07.300
Go, Cougars!

SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA. 1998.

01:27.700 --> 01:29.000
IN CASE OF EMERGENCY
LOVE YOU, DADDY

01:37.900 --> 01:39.800
You know, you don't have to
keep buying stuff for cover

01:39.800 --> 01:41.100
BURBANK, CALIFORNIA. 2008
just 'cause you're
in here all the time.

01:41.100 --> 01:43.300
BURBANK, CALIFORNIA. 2008
I actually needed
new iPod speakers.

01:43.400 --> 01:44.500
I'm just saying it's
perfectly plausible

01:44.500 --> 01:44.900
that you're in
here to discuss

01:44.900 --> 01:46.800
dinner plans with
me, your boyfriend.

01:46.800 --> 01:49.800
Okay, sweetie, what are you in
the mood for, Thai or Chinese?

01:50.100 --> 01:51.100
Wait, really?
No, I'm still

01:51.100 --> 01:52.600
digesting my Honey
Nut Cheerios.

01:52.600 --> 01:53.800
Okay, I'm a
little unprepared

01:53.800 --> 01:56.000
to discuss dinner
plans at this point.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Oh, unless we're...

01:57.000 --> 01:59.200
unless we're not going
to be actually eating.

01:59.200 --> 02:01.200
Will we be eating food
or are we just saying

02:01.200 --> 02:02.500
we'll be eating food?

02:02.700 --> 02:03.700
Not that it really
matters, it just...

02:03.700 --> 02:05.100
it'll factor into
lunch, you know?

02:05.100 --> 02:06.600
Can I get a straight
answer from you, Sarah?

02:06.600 --> 02:08.400
I mean, you don't have
to be so secretive

02:08.400 --> 02:09.900
or dodgy about pad
Thai noodles...

02:09.900 --> 02:11.600
Bogey at your six.

02:14.600 --> 02:16.600
Roger that- secure
the asset immediately.

02:16.600 --> 02:18.000
Take him to the Orange Orange.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.700
Hey, ow, ow,
okay, okay, okay.

02:20.700 --> 02:21.600
You stay here.

02:21.600 --> 02:22.500
Why, what's going on?

02:22.500 --> 02:23.700
I couldn't shake
a suspicious tail,

02:23.700 --> 02:25.500
so until we establish
the depth of the threat,

02:25.500 --> 02:27.000
you're staying put- don't move.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.200
Touch nothing.

02:28.500 --> 02:30.300
Wait for me, got it?

02:30.500 --> 02:31.600
Whatever.

02:41.400 --> 02:42.700
Oh, wow.

02:43.900 --> 02:47.600
I can't believe I'm this close
to an actual DU97.

02:47.600 --> 02:51.200
Freon-cooled, reconfigurable
30-teraflop architecture

02:51.200 --> 02:55.100
with modules for cryptanalysis
and video processing.

02:55.600 --> 02:57.300
She's so beautiful.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.300
I know you.

03:15.400 --> 03:17.000
And I never
forget a face.

03:18.600 --> 03:21.300
Buy More, courtyard.

03:21.600 --> 03:22.500
AKWARD

03:22.500 --> 03:24.900
Guess I just have one
of those familiar faces.

03:24.900 --> 03:25.600
Jackpot.

03:25.600 --> 03:27.500
That's not it-
I know you.

03:27.500 --> 03:30.000
I tried my hand at acting
a while back.

03:30.000 --> 03:30.900
It'll come to me.

03:30.900 --> 03:32.800
I was on a national
television commercial.

03:32.800 --> 03:34.300
I ate a messy cheeseburger.

03:34.300 --> 03:35.400
Maybe that's it.

03:35.700 --> 03:38.000
I know exactly who you are.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.800
We went to high school together!

03:42.600 --> 03:43.500
What?

03:43.500 --> 03:45.500
Wait, wait, wait,
don't tell me your name.

03:45.800 --> 03:46.700
I'll get it.

03:47.400 --> 03:48.800
I never forget
a face.

03:49.500 --> 03:51.600
You look so
different now.

03:51.700 --> 03:52.900
Well, for the
better, I mean.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.200
Oh, I'm sure you
have me confused

03:55.200 --> 03:56.800
- with someone else...
- Jenny!

03:58.000 --> 03:59.700
That's it: Jenny Burton!

04:01.800 --> 04:03.400
Jenny Burton?

04:03.500 --> 04:04.800
Heather Chandler.

04:10.700 --> 04:12.200
Well, Heather Ratner now.

04:12.200 --> 04:13.700
I married
Mark Ratner.

04:18.300 --> 04:20.300
James Buchanan High,
class of '98.

04:20.300 --> 04:22.500
Go, Cougars!

04:22.700 --> 04:24.000
Heather, of course.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.500
Um, how have you been?

04:26.100 --> 04:28.200
Oh, my God, Mark,
look who it is.

04:28.800 --> 04:29.900
It's Jenny Burton.

04:30.500 --> 04:31.000
Who?

04:31.000 --> 04:32.600
Jenny Burton from
high school.

04:32.600 --> 04:34.600
You know, the one.

04:35.200 --> 04:37.200
Oh, yeah, hi, Jenny.

04:38.500 --> 04:39.900
Heading down for the reunion
this weekend?

04:39.900 --> 04:43.100
Oh, no, I'm not much
of a reunion person.

04:43.700 --> 04:44.600
Hey.

04:44.900 --> 04:46.800
I told you to stay put.

04:46.800 --> 04:48.400
I know, I just, you know...

04:48.600 --> 04:50.000
the tummy is a-rumbling.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.900
- Chuck.
- Yes, honey?

04:51.900 --> 04:53.300
Is this your
boyfriend?

04:53.300 --> 04:54.900
Wait, you know
these people, sweetie?

04:54.900 --> 04:57.900
- NO.
-  I'm Heather- we all went to high school together.

04:59.300 --> 05:00.500
Come on!

05:00.500 --> 05:02.700
Of all the semi-tart
Asian influenced

05:02.700 --> 05:04.400
frozen yogurt shops
in all the towns

05:04.400 --> 05:06.400
in all the world,
you walked into hers?

05:06.400 --> 05:08.100
I know, it's
crazy, right?

05:08.100 --> 05:09.200
We live
in Westlake now

05:09.200 --> 05:10.500
because its closer
to Mark's work,

05:10.500 --> 05:12.300
but we go down
there all the time.

05:13.200 --> 05:14.600
Do you? You go...

05:15.300 --> 05:17.000
go down there, huh?

05:17.900 --> 05:19.400
Weather's real nice
this time of year.

05:19.400 --> 05:21.300
Do you need a to-go lid?

05:21.300 --> 05:22.300
Well, come on now.

05:22.300 --> 05:24.300
Weather's always great
in San Diego.

05:24.800 --> 05:25.600
Yes, it is!

05:25.600 --> 05:27.400
That's what I always say,
down there

05:27.400 --> 05:29.800
in San Diego where you're from.

05:30.200 --> 05:30.700
I'm Chuck, by the way,

05:30.700 --> 05:32.800
but around here,

05:33.100 --> 05:34.800
people just know me as...

05:36.600 --> 05:38.500
as Jenny's Chuck.

05:39.400 --> 05:40.300
Jenny and Chuck.

05:40.800 --> 05:41.600
Chuck and Jenny.

05:41.700 --> 05:43.200
Chuck, I'm Mark Ratner.

05:44.500 --> 05:45.300
VOICE RECOGNITION: MATCH

05:45.300 --> 05:46.300
VINTHROP-KELLER
AERONAUTICS

05:50.000 --> 05:50.700
Brain freeze.

05:50.700 --> 05:52.700
I think I had a little
too much yogurt.

05:55.200 --> 05:56.000
Hey.

05:56.500 --> 05:58.000
What are you guys doing
for dinner tonight?

05:58.000 --> 05:59.200
You got any plans?
'Cause maybe

05:59.200 --> 06:00.200
we could all
get together

06:00.200 --> 06:02.100
and reminisce about old times.

06:02.100 --> 06:03.200
Sounds great.

06:03.400 --> 06:05.100
I mean, any friends of Jenny
are friends of mine.

06:05.100 --> 06:06.900
Oh, I don't know, Chuck,

06:06.900 --> 06:08.500
it might be pretty
boring for you

06:08.500 --> 06:11.300
to take a trip
down memory lane with us.

06:11.300 --> 06:13.200
Good God, no, not at all.

06:13.200 --> 06:15.500
I can't think of anything
that I'd rather do

06:15.500 --> 06:16.700
than spend an evening

06:17.700 --> 06:19.100
learning all about...

06:20.000 --> 06:21.100
my Jenny.

<i>Gather 'round, clock punchers.</i>

07:03.800 --> 07:04.800
Big announcement.

07:05.300 --> 07:05.900
I'm not coming in

07:05.900 --> 07:07.700
for a few days-
got a meeting.

07:07.700 --> 07:09.600
Oh, some fat cats
over at corporate?

07:09.600 --> 07:10.400
Nope.

07:11.300 --> 07:12.800
With a bunch
of fat catfish

07:12.800 --> 07:14.200
over in Lake Havasu.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.900
And while I'm away,
Mr. Patel here

07:17.300 --> 07:18.700
will be in charge.

07:18.800 --> 07:19.800
Party hardy.

07:20.900 --> 07:22.500
Or the opposite of that?

07:22.500 --> 07:25.600
I want you to give Lester
the same respect you give me.

07:25.600 --> 07:26.800
When you look
at him,

07:27.200 --> 07:28.700
I want you
to see Big Mike

07:29.100 --> 07:31.900
and not some
scrawny-ass Indian kid

07:31.900 --> 07:33.800
with a Bay City
Rollers hairdo.

07:34.300 --> 07:35.300
Thank you, sir.

07:35.300 --> 07:36.200
That's it.

07:36.400 --> 07:37.500
Back to the salt mine.

07:39.000 --> 07:39.900
<i>Dinner? Come on!</i>

07:39.900 --> 07:41.400
What the hell
were you thinking, Chuck?

07:41.400 --> 07:42.300
What was I
supposed to do?

07:42.300 --> 07:43.000
I flashed on the guy.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.200
Those people
are from my past,

07:44.200 --> 07:46.500
a past you have no business
poking around in.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.300
Well, I'm sorry, I was
just trying to do my job.

07:48.300 --> 07:50.500
I thought you'd be happy
I used a little initiative.

07:50.500 --> 07:52.400
Uh, don't kill the messenger.

07:52.400 --> 07:53.700
Not the kid's fault
you went to high school

07:53.700 --> 07:55.500
with a treasonous scumbag.

07:56.200 --> 07:58.100
Good morning, boys and girl.

07:58.100 --> 08:01.600
First matter of
business: Mark Ratner.

08:01.700 --> 08:03.900
He's an engineer
at Winthrop-Keller Aeronautics,

08:03.900 --> 08:06.100
has clearance to
extremely sensitive plans

08:06.100 --> 08:08.200
for future weapons
technology.

08:08.200 --> 08:11.400
Picture the next generation
of F-22 Raptors.

08:11.500 --> 08:13.500
Essentially, a superbomber.

08:14.200 --> 08:16.000
This technology
has been leaked.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.400
Chuck's instincts
were good.

08:17.400 --> 08:18.800
Your mission is
to go to dinner

08:18.800 --> 08:21.600
with the Ratners, see if Chuck
flashes off of anything.

08:21.600 --> 08:23.700
General, I apologize,
but I'm afraid

08:23.700 --> 08:25.500
I must recuse myself
from this mission.

08:25.500 --> 08:27.100
My cover has been compromised.

08:27.100 --> 08:28.100
Agent Walker,

08:28.100 --> 08:31.000
you have preexisting social
history with the target.

08:31.500 --> 08:33.900
Seems to me like you
have the perfect cover.

08:34.100 --> 08:37.299
But it's not a cover,
ma'am, it's me.

08:37.600 --> 08:41.100
Well, I hope you
enjoy Italian food.

08:41.500 --> 08:42.600
<i>Buon appetito.</i>

08:44.200 --> 08:45.100
<i>With Big Mike gone,</i>

08:45.300 --> 08:46.200
I've come up
with a plan

08:46.200 --> 08:48.100
to revolutionize
Buy More sales.

08:48.100 --> 08:50.900
<i>From now on, we're gonna work
with our customers</i>

08:50.900 --> 08:54.100
to create a mutually
agreed upon price.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.300
Yeah, but how are we supposed
to do that? I mean...

08:57.100 --> 08:58.700
As this is
a teaching hospital...

08:59.600 --> 09:00.900
watch and learn,
my friends.

09:01.000 --> 09:01.900
Watch and learn.

09:05.200 --> 09:06.900
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:06.900 --> 09:08.700
So, you're in the market
for a new TV.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.000
- Yeah. 
- You shopping for your mother?

09:11.200 --> 09:12.000
What?

09:12.300 --> 09:13.400
No, it's for me.

09:13.700 --> 09:15.300
This one's a little
dainty, isn't it?

09:16.200 --> 09:19.100
You want the complete
entertainment experience.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.400
I would recommend
this one.

09:21.700 --> 09:24.500
Uh, I can't
afford this one.

09:24.500 --> 09:27.000
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

09:27.600 --> 09:30.000
Don't get caught up in this.

09:30.200 --> 09:31.300
This...

09:32.000 --> 09:33.300
is just a suggestion.

09:35.100 --> 09:36.500
How about you make me an offer?

09:36.800 --> 09:37.700
Okay.

09:39.700 --> 09:41.400
How about you shave 300 bucks
off that price?

09:41.400 --> 09:43.800
- Sold.
- Really?

09:47.600 --> 09:48.400
Hey there.

09:48.400 --> 09:49.800
May I help you
with this washer and dryer?

09:50.000 --> 09:51.600
Oh, afraid it's
not in my budget.

09:51.600 --> 09:53.500
I'm only in the
market for a dryer.

09:53.800 --> 09:56.000
Ma'am, that's like
buying one new shoe.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.900
No, no, no, no,
make me an offer.

09:58.400 --> 09:59.900
You happy with
that price?

10:00.400 --> 10:02.600
Guess I'd be happier
if it was 100 bucks cheaper.

10:02.900 --> 10:04.900
I live for your smile.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.600
Let me take off $200.

10:08.200 --> 10:09.100
Deal.

10:13.500 --> 10:14.400
I'll sell you
that computer

10:14.400 --> 10:16.900
for 400 bucks
off sticker price.

10:19.100 --> 10:20.200
Hey, buddy, what's going on?

10:20.700 --> 10:22.200
Lester's new sales policy.

10:23.800 --> 10:25.200
We're giving away
the merchandise.

10:25.600 --> 10:27.000
Throw in
a wireless mouse?

10:27.100 --> 10:29.700
<i>Throw in a wireless mouse
and a bonus computer.</i>

10:29.700 --> 10:31.100
That's gonna
end badly.

10:31.600 --> 10:32.500
I know.

10:32.900 --> 10:33.900
I know, Chuck.

10:34.100 --> 10:35.300
That's part of the fun.

10:35.600 --> 10:36.500
Sold.

10:40.500 --> 10:41.600
You're early.

10:42.300 --> 10:43.500
Technically, I'm right on time

10:43.500 --> 10:45.200
for my pre-mission
debriefing.

10:45.600 --> 10:46.700
What are you talking about?

10:46.700 --> 10:48.000
Standard spy protocol.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.200
You know, I need some stats
for my cover tonight.

10:50.200 --> 10:51.500
- Chuck, I'm really...
- No need to apologize

10:51.500 --> 10:54.700
if you didn't have time
for full dossier preparation.

10:54.700 --> 10:57.600
I think we'll just go over a few
facts together if that's okay.

10:59.900 --> 11:01.700
Fantastic. I'll go first.

11:01.700 --> 11:04.200
Uh, tonight, I'll be playing the
role of Jenny's boyfriend Chuck.

11:04.200 --> 11:06.300
He works at the Buy More,
not living up to his potential.

11:06.300 --> 11:08.600
Sister is Ellie, doctor,
engaged to a doctor.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.900
There, all up to speed
on Jenny's boyfriend.

11:10.900 --> 11:11.900
Your turn.

11:12.500 --> 11:13.800
I'm not doing this.

11:14.100 --> 11:15.400
Okay, here's what we know
thus far.

11:15.500 --> 11:16.200
Jenny Burton went to

11:16.200 --> 11:17.400
James Buchanan
High School

11:17.400 --> 11:20.100
in San Diego, California,
class of 1998.

11:20.100 --> 11:21.400
Is it safe to assume
that "Jenny"

11:21.400 --> 11:22.900
is a diminutive of "Jennifer?"

11:22.900 --> 11:24.500
Back off, Chuck.

11:24.600 --> 11:27.900
You have as much information as
is pertinent to this assignment.

11:29.500 --> 11:31.600
Spell "Jenny" with
an "I" or would...

11:31.900 --> 11:33.100
All Jenny's boyfriend
needs to know

11:33.100 --> 11:36.700
is that Jenny hates
questions about her past.

11:38.900 --> 11:40.200
You got that?

11:40.700 --> 11:41.900
I'm good.
Yeah, I'm good.

11:45.300 --> 11:46.700
How do you do that?

11:53.700 --> 11:54.700
So, Mark,

11:54.700 --> 11:57.200
uh... what line of work
are you in?

11:57.200 --> 11:58.600
Uh, engineering.

11:59.300 --> 12:00.400
Actually, what
I'm working on

12:00.400 --> 12:01.800
is technically...

12:01.800 --> 12:03.400
- top secret.
- And let's keep it that way,

12:03.400 --> 12:04.900
'cause no one gives a rip.

12:06.900 --> 12:09.700
So, how long have you two
lovebirds been together?

12:09.700 --> 12:10.800
- Months.
- Years.

12:10.900 --> 12:12.300
That add up to years.

12:12.300 --> 12:14.800
You know, I don't even remember
my life before Chuck.

12:18.000 --> 12:18.800
What's the matter with you?

12:18.800 --> 12:19.700
You're sweating
like a pig.

12:19.700 --> 12:20.900
It's kind of gross.

12:20.900 --> 12:22.200
No. Oh, sorry.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.800
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

12:24.300 --> 12:25.900
Would you excuse me
for a minute?

12:26.000 --> 12:26.800
Sure.

12:30.100 --> 12:31.700
So, Jenny, is your

12:31.700 --> 12:33.500
job at the yogurt shop,
like, a career

12:33.500 --> 12:34.600
or are you
keeping yourself

12:34.600 --> 12:36.600
in Top Ramen
between acting gigs.

12:36.600 --> 12:38.400
Oh, I-I've got
a few things going on.

12:38.400 --> 12:39.700
I mean, Chuck,
if you had told me

12:39.700 --> 12:41.400
in high school that Jenny Burton
wanted to grow up

12:41.400 --> 12:43.300
to be a movie star,
I would've said,

12:43.300 --> 12:45.100
"Dream,
little duckling, dream. "

12:45.600 --> 12:46.600
And now here we are.

12:52.600 --> 12:54.600
Your time is up,
Mr. Ratner.

13:01.800 --> 13:03.400
Soup looks delicious, Chuck.

13:03.400 --> 13:05.100
Mmm, it is.

13:05.600 --> 13:07.000
Cilantro,
very controversial.

13:07.000 --> 13:07.900
You either love
it or hate it.

13:07.900 --> 13:09.200
Me, I love it.

13:09.200 --> 13:11.500
So, Jenny, when's the last time
you were down in San Diego?

13:11.500 --> 13:13.500
Mm, it's
been a while.

13:13.500 --> 13:15.500
Mm, don't get to visit
your dad much?

13:18.000 --> 13:20.400
Um, excuse me,
more wine, please.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.100
Ah, yes.

13:22.100 --> 13:24.600
It's a lovely pinot
noir, earthy, complex,

13:24.600 --> 13:26.700
- with a hint of cherry blossoms.
- So, you know when you're kids

13:26.700 --> 13:27.700
and there's
always that funhouse

13:27.700 --> 13:28.700
that all the kids
hang out at.

13:28.700 --> 13:29.300
Would you say that was

13:29.300 --> 13:30.500
the case with Jenny's

13:30.500 --> 13:33.300
- house-condo-apartment?
- Oh!
- Oh! 
- Oh, my God.

13:33.300 --> 13:34.500
I'm so sorry.

13:34.500 --> 13:36.700
God, I'm-I'm
such a spaz.

13:36.700 --> 13:38.300
Now, there's the Jenny we know.

13:39.700 --> 13:41.100
Excuse me.
Beg your pardon.

13:47.500 --> 13:50.500
Not the first American tax
dollars wasted on a man's lap.

13:52.100 --> 13:53.300
Give us the plans now.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.800
I need to know 
that if I hand over the plans,

13:57.900 --> 13:59.500
no harm will come to my wife.

14:07.900 --> 14:08.400
Oh, my God.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.300
Who the hell are you?
Who is this guy?!

14:10.700 --> 14:11.600
This is setup?

14:11.600 --> 14:13.600
No! God, no!
He's no one!

14:13.700 --> 14:14.600
That's a little hurtful.

14:14.600 --> 14:15.600
He's just the
boyfriend

14:15.600 --> 14:16.900
of some-some girl
that I went

14:16.900 --> 14:18.400
to high school with!

14:18.900 --> 14:21.300
I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna
grab some club soda

14:21.300 --> 14:23.000
to take care of my stain.

14:23.600 --> 14:26.800
So, Heather, uh, how do you
stay in such great shape?

14:26.800 --> 14:29.500
Got obsessed with karate 'cause
my instructor's such a hottie.

14:29.500 --> 14:30.900
I'm a black belt now.

14:31.800 --> 14:32.600
I clued in you didn't want

14:32.600 --> 14:33.900
to talk about
your dad's situation

14:33.900 --> 14:35.400
in front of your BF.

14:35.500 --> 14:36.700
Does Chuck not know?

14:38.100 --> 14:39.900
Uh, do you mind if I take over?

14:40.100 --> 14:40.900
Oh, no.

14:40.900 --> 14:42.000
It's my first day.

14:42.900 --> 14:44.400
- Go check on Chuck.
- If you promise

14:44.400 --> 14:45.600
not to filet her
before I get back.

14:45.600 --> 14:47.700
- I can't promise anything.
- Okay.

14:48.200 --> 14:49.900
Took a knife skills course

14:49.900 --> 14:51.500
at the culinary academy.

14:51.500 --> 14:53.400
Is that to further
your yogurt career,

14:53.400 --> 14:54.700
or are you
angling towards

14:54.700 --> 14:55.700
something bigger?

14:55.700 --> 14:58.200
Say, carving station at Lawry's.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.600
So, what you know?

15:03.600 --> 15:04.900
I don't know anything.

15:04.900 --> 15:07.300
I just came in to do
my little boy business.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.300
Turn on hand dryer,

15:09.400 --> 15:10.900
so no one hear him scream.

15:12.500 --> 15:14.300
Hear who scream? Me scream?

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
You?

15:22.000 --> 15:22.600
All right.

15:22.600 --> 15:23.300
Gonna pull the van around

15:23.300 --> 15:24.200
so we can stow these guys.

15:24.200 --> 15:25.200
Be right back.

15:26.200 --> 15:27.200
Oh.

15:37.600 --> 15:38.500
How?

15:39.100 --> 15:40.200
How did you do that?

15:40.300 --> 15:41.100
Uh...

15:41.800 --> 15:43.100
Uh, you know,

15:43.500 --> 15:46.800
it's a self-defense thing
I took at the Y.

15:46.900 --> 15:47.900
It was pretty comprehensive.

15:48.400 --> 15:48.900
Are you nuts?

15:48.900 --> 15:50.300
These guys are killers!

15:50.300 --> 15:51.900
Bullies are like bears,
you know?

15:51.900 --> 15:54.100
They're more afraid of you
than you are of them.

15:54.100 --> 15:55.200
Or is that bees?

15:55.500 --> 15:56.500
Actually,
it is bee.

15:56.500 --> 15:58.300
Anyway, when you're dealing
with the Russian mob...

15:58.300 --> 16:01.300
How, how did you know
they're connected to the mob?

16:02.300 --> 16:03.200
Wait a minute.

16:04.400 --> 16:06.000
I know exactly who you are.

16:06.600 --> 16:07.300
Dude!

16:07.700 --> 16:09.200
You're the man!

16:09.600 --> 16:10.800
I'm hardly the man.

16:10.900 --> 16:11.500
So who do you work for?

16:11.500 --> 16:12.800
Is it the FBI?

16:13.000 --> 16:14.700
CIA? NSA?

16:14.700 --> 16:18.800
I, you know, I can't
discuss the particulars.

16:19.300 --> 16:20.100
Okay.

16:20.200 --> 16:21.300
I get it, I get it.

16:21.700 --> 16:24.200
But just tell me, does-does
Jenny know who you really are?

16:24.200 --> 16:25.500
Jenny knows nothing.

16:25.600 --> 16:26.500
Of course not.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.900
But anyway, I-I just
want to thank you so much

16:30.900 --> 16:32.800
for saving my life.

16:34.000 --> 16:34.700
Can't you just

16:34.900 --> 16:37.000
tell me your name, Agent...?

16:38.000 --> 16:38.900
Carmichael.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.500
Special Agent
Charles Carmichael.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.600
This is not a negotiation.

16:53.500 --> 16:54.500
Okay, Ratner,

16:55.100 --> 16:56.300
here's how this is
gonna go down.

16:56.300 --> 16:56.900
Wait.

16:56.900 --> 16:57.900
You're our waiter.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.200
From the
restaurant.

16:59.200 --> 17:01.400
Man, we really screwed you
on the tip.

17:01.600 --> 17:02.900
You want into
witness protection,

17:02.900 --> 17:04.599
you're gonna have
to scratch our back, too.

17:05.300 --> 17:06.200
What do you mean?

17:07.400 --> 17:09.700
Those two goons from last night,
they don't report back

17:09.700 --> 17:11.700
to their boss, he's gonna
want a follow-up meet.

17:12.099 --> 17:13.400
We're gonna cover that drop.

17:13.599 --> 17:14.700
He contact
you yet?

17:15.900 --> 17:18.599
I'm sorry, but I
prefer to deal only

17:18.599 --> 17:20.800
with Special
Agent Carmichael.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.099
The man saved my life
last night.

17:29.100 --> 17:31.800
Is that right,
Special Agent Carmichael?

17:32.300 --> 17:33.300
Uh...

17:36.000 --> 17:36.900
It's funny...

17:37.900 --> 17:39.000
You should really see me

17:39.200 --> 17:42.000
scale buildings with
suction cups, 'cause I'm...

17:42.800 --> 17:43.700
I'm very good at that.

17:43.700 --> 17:46.000
I only dabble in the violence.
So...

17:46.400 --> 17:48.900
Modesty doesn't suit you,
Mad Dog.

17:51.500 --> 17:52.200
Mad Dog?

17:52.200 --> 17:54.400
Why... Why do they
call him that?

18:08.300 --> 18:10.400
Listen, I got to know
where your next meet's at, okay?

18:11.300 --> 18:12.700
And I'll ask you real politely.

18:12.900 --> 18:14.600
My partner here, he's a maniac.

18:15.200 --> 18:16.000
It's...

18:16.100 --> 18:17.800
It's fine when
it's to protect you,

18:18.200 --> 18:20.300
but you don't want to be
on the receiving end of Mad Dog.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.500
That's how I got this.

18:23.400 --> 18:24.300
Huh?

18:24.700 --> 18:26.300
I parked in his spot once.

18:26.800 --> 18:27.500
This scar

18:27.600 --> 18:31.400
reminds me every day-
don't mess with Mad Dog.

18:31.400 --> 18:32.000
Now, I'm gonna ask you...

18:32.000 --> 18:33.600
Let me ask you
one more time.

18:35.500 --> 18:36.600
Where's the meet?

18:36.600 --> 18:39.000
Look, I-I don't know, okay?

18:39.000 --> 18:39.800
He texts me.

18:39.800 --> 18:41.300
That's it, that's all I know.

18:46.600 --> 18:47.700
He's all yours,
Mad Dog.

18:47.700 --> 18:48.500
No, no! I...

18:48.500 --> 18:49.500
Wait a minute.

18:49.500 --> 18:50.900
This, this is him,

18:51.000 --> 18:52.600
right now. He's-he's-he's...

18:52.600 --> 18:54.400
He's texting me right
now! This is him!

18:56.000 --> 18:57.300
Okay, he wants to meet tonight.

18:57.300 --> 18:58.700
But-but that doesn't
work for me.

18:58.700 --> 18:59.500
I can't meet tonight.

18:59.500 --> 19:00.600
Tonight's my reunion,

19:00.600 --> 19:02.000
and my wife has
really been looking

19:02.000 --> 19:04.200
forward to this- she
wants to be reunion queen.

19:04.200 --> 19:05.100
I couldn't disappoint her.

19:05.100 --> 19:06.400
Stop talking!

19:06.900 --> 19:08.000
You'll meet him there.

19:08.100 --> 19:10.400
I... I-I don't know about this.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.100
No one's gonna
mess with you, man.

19:13.500 --> 19:14.600
I got your back.

19:16.400 --> 19:17.200
Okay.

19:18.100 --> 19:19.200
Okay, I'll do it.

19:20.900 --> 19:21.900
No!

19:22.600 --> 19:23.500
This can't be right!

19:23.500 --> 19:28.500
No! No! No! No!

19:28.500 --> 19:30.800
No! How did
this happen?!

19:30.900 --> 19:31.600
No!

19:31.600 --> 19:33.100
Hey, Chuck, what's up, buddy?
What are you doing here?

19:33.100 --> 19:34.600
- I thought it's your day off. 
- Yeah.

19:34.600 --> 19:36.700
I had to swing by the mall to
pick something up for Sarah.

19:36.700 --> 19:38.300
It's a long story.
What's going on with Lester?

19:38.300 --> 19:39.800
What is happening?!

19:40.000 --> 19:41.900
Is this broken?!
Are you broken?!

19:42.600 --> 19:44.000
He's been at it for,
like, 15 minutes.

19:44.900 --> 19:45.700
Hey.

19:45.800 --> 19:46.900
What's going on?
Everything okay?

19:46.900 --> 19:47.900
Chuck.

19:48.200 --> 19:49.300
Chuck, thank God you're here.

19:49.300 --> 19:50.800
You-you'll know what to do.

19:50.800 --> 19:52.400
Look, so the new
Friendly Negotiations

19:52.400 --> 19:54.300
sales strategy
worked brilliantly.

19:54.300 --> 19:55.700
Right? We moved
the largest volume

19:55.800 --> 19:57.200
of big-ticket merchandise
in four years.

19:57.200 --> 19:58.900
But no matter how many times
I crunch the numbers,

19:59.200 --> 20:01.000
we're still out 2,700 bucks.

20:01.900 --> 20:03.100
Well, you forgot
to carry the one,

20:03.100 --> 20:05.000
so actually it's 3,700.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.800
What?! Oh,
my God!

20:08.100 --> 20:09.400
I'm sorry I let you down, sir.

20:09.400 --> 20:10.000
All right, come on.

20:10.600 --> 20:11.600
Pull yourself
together here, man.

20:11.600 --> 20:12.200
All right, everybody, listen up.

20:12.200 --> 20:14.200
We are up excrement creek
without a paddle.

20:14.200 --> 20:15.600
Okay? So we're just
looking for a few ideas

20:15.600 --> 20:17.600
to make a lot of cash
by tonight. Any ideas?

20:17.600 --> 20:19.700
My mom knows a dude
who will torch the place.

20:19.900 --> 20:21.400
Our troubles will
go up in flames.

20:21.400 --> 20:22.200
Yeah.

20:23.100 --> 20:24.300
While I'm impressed by

20:24.300 --> 20:26.500
the outside-of-the-box nature
of Jeff's pitch,

20:26.600 --> 20:27.400
I'm thinking
maybe

20:27.400 --> 20:28.600
a simpler solution.

20:28.600 --> 20:29.800
Remember when we were
in high school

20:29.800 --> 20:31.000
and we were hard
up for cash,

20:31.000 --> 20:31.900
so when your
parents were out

20:31.900 --> 20:33.300
of town, we'd host
a big kegger,

20:33.300 --> 20:35.300
invite everybody
and charge by the head.

20:36.700 --> 20:38.100
That's great, Chuck,
that's perfect.

20:38.100 --> 20:39.600
- That's what we're gonna do.
- Yes!

20:39.600 --> 20:41.300
No, no, no, I was... that...

20:41.300 --> 20:43.100
I... that was a good idea
if we were 16.

20:43.100 --> 20:44.500
Invite people from the mall.

20:44.500 --> 20:46.200
And I can call
my best friend, Beer,

20:46.500 --> 20:48.300
see if he can make it
on such short notice.

20:48.300 --> 20:51.000
This could actually work,
this could actually work.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.800
Great, good, glad I'll
be 100 miles away.

21:07.800 --> 21:08.700
LET GO!

21:23.100 --> 21:24.300
Hey, Jenny.

21:26.200 --> 21:27.400
You must be getting
pretty lonely

21:27.400 --> 21:28.900
with your dad locked up.

21:31.900 --> 21:34.100
Call me if you ever need a man
around the house.

21:49.200 --> 21:50.200
What?

21:50.300 --> 21:51.600
Brought you a present.

21:51.700 --> 21:53.000
Well, it's not
my birthday.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.500
Oh, one down,

21:54.500 --> 21:57.700
364 and a quarter
possibilities to go.

21:59.300 --> 22:01.400
Just open the box, hmm?

22:05.600 --> 22:07.200
Why do I need
a new dress for?

22:08.000 --> 22:09.900
I know you're gonna see
this as a glass half-empty,

22:09.900 --> 22:11.200
but I think it's a
real opportunity...

22:11.200 --> 22:13.200
- Spill it! 
- We have to go to your reunion.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.500
Look, I know that you don't like

22:16.500 --> 22:18.600
talking about your past,
much less revisiting it,

22:18.600 --> 22:20.800
but the reunion is where
the drop's going down.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.500
Look, I'm sorry.

22:22.500 --> 22:23.500
It's just...

22:24.400 --> 22:25.200
High school...

22:26.000 --> 22:27.700
It was a tough time
for me, okay?

22:28.100 --> 22:28.800
Tell me about it.

22:28.800 --> 22:29.800
I- I-I get that.

22:29.800 --> 22:31.100
Trying to figure out
who you are

22:31.100 --> 22:32.700
and what you're gonna do
with the rest of your life

22:32.700 --> 22:35.100
while constantly distracted
with raging hormones.

22:35.100 --> 22:37.800
- I... 
- It was more than that for me.

22:42.700 --> 22:46.300
Hey... it'll be okay.

22:46.600 --> 22:47.300
Trust me.

22:50.100 --> 22:51.600
Besides, everybody
remembers high school

22:51.600 --> 22:52.800
way worse than it was.

23:02.800 --> 23:04.100
YOU LOOK GREAT

23:06.100 --> 23:08.200
Welcome Cougar,
class of '98!

23:08.600 --> 23:09.400
Hi.

23:09.700 --> 23:10.900
Jennifer Burton?

23:11.900 --> 23:13.000
Burton?

23:13.000 --> 23:14.400
Ooh, here.

23:15.000 --> 23:15.600
Thanks.

23:15.600 --> 23:17.800
Wait. You're Jenny Burton?

23:19.000 --> 23:20.200
I am if it says I am

23:23.500 --> 23:25.700
OH, MY GOD.

23:26.300 --> 23:27.700
Hey, hey.

23:27.700 --> 23:28.900
Hey, hey, hey.

23:31.200 --> 23:32.700
No one's gonna mess
with you, Sarah, okay?

23:32.700 --> 23:33.900
I got your back.

23:39.500 --> 23:40.400
Wow!

23:40.400 --> 23:41.500
Oh.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
It's not that bad.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.200
- It's not that bad. 
- Mm-hmm.

23:48.200 --> 23:50.200
WELCOME BACK 
COUGARS CLASS OF 1998!

24:04.800 --> 24:05.900
Thank you.

24:06.700 --> 24:08.000
Remember, the only difference

24:08.000 --> 24:09.700
between high school
and a high school reunion is

24:09.700 --> 24:11.700
that you don't get suspended
for being drunk.

24:22.800 --> 24:23.700
Want to dance?

24:23.700 --> 24:24.700
Fortunately for you,
I was at the top

24:24.700 --> 24:27.400
of my game in '98.
Oh, a little bit of that.

24:27.900 --> 24:29.500
Come that, oh, and then...
and then mirror that,

24:29.500 --> 24:30.600
you know,
just kind of...

24:30.900 --> 24:32.200
What? What is it? You okay?

24:32.400 --> 24:34.800
So, my buddies and I
checked out the room

24:34.800 --> 24:36.500
and picked the
best-looking girl here.

24:36.700 --> 24:38.600
Decided to come
introduce myself

24:38.600 --> 24:40.700
to the woman I'll be
waking up with tomorrow.

24:42.700 --> 24:43.300
Dick Duffy.

24:43.300 --> 24:45.400
And I'm Chuck,
Jenny's boyfriend, so...

24:45.600 --> 24:48.100
Jenny? Wait. Jenny Burton?

24:48.900 --> 24:49.800
Damn!

24:50.100 --> 24:52.200
Ten years has been
very sweet to you.

24:52.900 --> 24:53.700
Thank you.

24:53.700 --> 24:55.600
Ten years is a hell
of a long time,

24:56.000 --> 24:58.500
especially to someone living
in an eight by ten cell.

25:00.900 --> 25:02.200
<i>How is your dad?</i>

25:06.900 --> 25:07.400
PAROLED 
LAS VENTURAS PRISON 4 YEARS: GRAND THEFT AUTO

25:11.700 --> 25:12.400
Nachos!

25:12.400 --> 25:13.700
Nachos! I
smell nachos!

25:13.700 --> 25:14.300
That's gonna
hit the spot.

25:14.300 --> 25:16.000
Let's get some
nachos. Bye, Dick.

25:17.600 --> 25:18.400
I think that's him,
that's the guy.

25:18.400 --> 25:20.300
- What guy? 
- Duffy. I just flashed on Duffy.

25:20.300 --> 25:21.700
What'd you do?
Attend Bad Guy High?

25:21.700 --> 25:22.600
What are you talking about?

25:22.600 --> 25:24.300
Well, Duffy has some kind of
connection to the Russian mob.

25:24.300 --> 25:26.200
I'm pretty sure he's the
guy that Ratner is supposed

25:26.200 --> 25:28.100
to connect with to hand
off the super-bomber plans.

25:28.100 --> 25:30.000
Makes sense.
He's always been a jerk.

25:30.300 --> 25:32.600
Okay, you go catch Ratner up,
have him set up the meet.

25:33.100 --> 25:34.200
I'll tip off the DJ.

25:34.300 --> 25:35.500
Why? Why the DJ?

25:46.400 --> 25:47.000
CUSTOMER SERVICE

25:53.100 --> 25:53.900
Dude, look at this.

25:53.900 --> 25:54.800
We're in a sweet spot.

25:54.800 --> 25:55.900
People are loving this.

25:55.900 --> 25:57.300
I can't believe
this is actually working.

25:57.400 --> 25:58.400
Hey! Hey!
Take off your shoes!

25:58.400 --> 25:59.500
Take off your shoes!

25:59.500 --> 26:01.700
Tell them
to wipe their feet, right?

26:04.700 --> 26:06.100
Keep it... Will you please
keep it down?

26:07.700 --> 26:08.900
Keep the fingers
off the merchandise

26:08.900 --> 26:09.800
over there, please.

26:16.000 --> 26:16.600
Please. Please.

26:16.600 --> 26:18.000
We got to be considerate
of the neighbors, okay?

26:18.000 --> 26:19.400
No, no, no, no, no, no!

26:19.400 --> 26:21.000
No! No!

26:21.900 --> 26:23.600
This the way you people treat
your own homes?!

26:24.000 --> 26:26.600
My bosses at Langley have
informed me that that's the guy

26:26.600 --> 26:27.500
who's been texting you.

26:28.700 --> 26:30.400
Our target is Dick Duffy?

26:31.800 --> 26:33.000
Of course!

26:33.700 --> 26:36.100
The guy who terrorizes
me in high school

26:36.100 --> 26:37.900
is now going
to terrorize the entire world

26:37.900 --> 26:39.400
with my super-bomber.

26:39.400 --> 26:40.300
You're gonna be just fine.

26:40.300 --> 26:42.100
You have my personal guarantee.

26:47.800 --> 26:50.200
Uh, excuse me, Dick?

26:52.400 --> 26:53.200
I believe
I'm supposed

26:53.200 --> 26:56.200
to see you
about a certain transaction.

26:56.500 --> 26:57.400
Ratner.

26:57.600 --> 26:58.500
You're the last guy I thought

26:58.500 --> 27:00.400
I'd be having
this conversation with.

27:00.700 --> 27:01.200
All right, fine.

27:01.200 --> 27:02.900
Meet me outside
in five minutes.

27:06.400 --> 27:08.200
Welcome class of '98!

27:09.400 --> 27:10.800
Go Cougars.

27:18.500 --> 27:18.900
Never should have

27:18.900 --> 27:20.600
stolen the
bomber plans.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.500
I should have gone
right to you guys.

27:22.700 --> 27:23.500
But they threatened my wife.

27:23.500 --> 27:25.000
I wasn't
thinking straight.

27:26.100 --> 27:26.700
You see,

27:26.700 --> 27:28.900
I'm just a guy who likes math,

27:29.300 --> 27:31.200
you know, and
somehow I got

27:31.200 --> 27:34.200
a beautiful girl like that
to fall in love with me.

27:34.300 --> 27:36.200
I have to pinch
myself sometimes.

27:36.300 --> 27:37.300
It's like
I'm dreaming.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
Ah, forget it, Agent Carmichael.

27:50.800 --> 27:52.200
I mean,
how can I expect a cool guy

27:52.200 --> 27:53.600
like you to understand?

27:54.900 --> 27:56.200
You know what, Mark?

27:58.600 --> 28:01.000
Sometimes the nerd
gets the girl.

28:08.700 --> 28:09.900
In the middle of something?

28:10.400 --> 28:11.600
Got time for you.

28:11.900 --> 28:13.300
Where's your boyfriend at?

28:13.500 --> 28:14.900
Oh, don't worry
about him.

28:15.900 --> 28:16.200
Can't believe

28:16.200 --> 28:18.300
you're that same Jenny
from high school.

28:18.600 --> 28:20.500
You've changed so much.

28:20.500 --> 28:23.000
Well, I'm still the same girl
on the inside.

28:23.600 --> 28:24.900
Bet you miss your daddy.

28:25.700 --> 28:27.100
He's been gone so long.

28:28.700 --> 28:31.400
But you know, baby,
you can always call me daddy.

28:33.200 --> 28:34.000
Ooh!

28:35.500 --> 28:38.100
That's all right.
I like my ladies rough.

28:41.100 --> 28:41.900
Great.

28:43.300 --> 28:45.600
Now we know he's a perv,
don't know if he's the perp.

28:45.700 --> 28:46.400
Yeah, sorry.

28:46.400 --> 28:48.500
I'm just working out
some childhood issues.

28:53.500 --> 28:56.000
Knockoff watches,
bootleg DVDs.

28:56.600 --> 28:57.000
He came out here

28:57.000 --> 28:58.300
to sell Ratner a dime bag.

28:58.300 --> 28:59.200
Guy's small time.

28:59.200 --> 29:01.600
So if Duffy isn't
our guy, then who is?

29:05.500 --> 29:07.200
My husband spilled everything
to the Feds.

29:07.200 --> 29:08.400
That's him and his handler.

29:08.400 --> 29:09.900
I overheard them talking.
He's some

29:09.900 --> 29:11.600
CIA bad ass named Carmichael.

29:13.900 --> 29:15.000
Kill 'em both.

29:56.300 --> 29:57.500
Give him to me.

29:57.700 --> 29:59.500
Find your own
freakin' fish!

30:01.600 --> 30:06.200
- GIVE ME THAT!- YOU'RE A FOOL!

30:06.200 --> 30:07.400
Norman!

30:21.500 --> 30:22.400
That's it!

30:24.500 --> 30:25.900
Party's over! Get out!

30:27.900 --> 30:29.600
Right now!

30:38.400 --> 30:40.800
I mean, was I born
to be a lawman? No.

30:41.300 --> 30:42.500
I'd say it's more
of a calling.

30:42.900 --> 30:44.000
I got a bit
of the shine.

30:48.700 --> 30:49.300
GANG ACTIVITY

30:51.600 --> 30:52.100
FORGERY

30:55.200 --> 30:56.000
Oh, no.

30:56.800 --> 30:57.600
What's oh, no?

30:57.600 --> 30:59.500
Slight wrinkle in the plan,
got to improvise.

30:59.500 --> 31:00.600
Move!

31:05.600 --> 31:06.600
Welcome!

31:07.000 --> 31:08.900
James Buchanan High,
Class of '98!

31:08.900 --> 31:10.100
Go Cougars!

31:14.400 --> 31:15.100
Uh...

31:15.700 --> 31:17.200
Uh, for those of you
who remember me,

31:17.200 --> 31:19.300
I clearly need no introduction,

31:19.300 --> 31:20.600
and for those
of you who don't,

31:21.300 --> 31:22.700
I'm not up here
to talk about myself anyway.

31:22.700 --> 31:24.900
No. I'm here to talk
to you about some people

31:24.900 --> 31:26.700
that will cause
you to flash,

31:26.800 --> 31:28.300
flash back,
that is.

31:28.300 --> 31:30.200
So, maybe with a...
with a few hints

31:30.200 --> 31:31.600
and a little bit of luck,

31:31.700 --> 31:33.000
we can find two
special Cougars,

31:33.000 --> 31:34.200
and throw some
love on them.

31:34.200 --> 31:36.000
Oh, how about... how about

31:36.000 --> 31:38.400
- this guy, huh?
- Michael Adler.

31:38.700 --> 31:40.200
Drooled his way
through Spanish class?

31:40.200 --> 31:41.400
<i>縎e habla espanol?</i>

31:41.400 --> 31:42.600
I know you
do, Michael.

31:43.800 --> 31:46.500
And, uh, who, uh...
who else do we have?

31:46.500 --> 31:47.400
Hey, she is a part of this.

31:47.400 --> 31:48.500
You go. I got these two.

31:48.600 --> 31:50.000
Oh! Oh! How about, uh...

31:50.000 --> 31:52.200
How about this guy
here? Come on, folks.

31:52.400 --> 31:53.900
I know you know
him. Chippy!

31:54.100 --> 31:56.100
Our one and only Chippy Sternin!

31:56.300 --> 31:57.500
Remember, all-star

31:57.500 --> 32:00.400
pole-vaulter, who was
unfortunately sidelined

32:00.400 --> 32:02.900
- with a horrible case of impetigo? 
- Come on, let's go.

32:02.900 --> 32:04.500
I was rooting for you,
buddy. I thought you were

32:04.500 --> 32:05.900
gonna go all-state,
but you know what?

32:05.900 --> 32:07.200
It wasn't
in the cards.

32:07.200 --> 32:08.500
Come on,
love on those guys really.

32:08.500 --> 32:10.800
Just throw some arms
around them.

32:13.300 --> 32:14.200
Heather?

32:16.100 --> 32:17.300
Who's drunk?
You're drunk.

32:17.300 --> 32:18.300
All right,
fantastic.

32:18.300 --> 32:19.800
Heather,
why'd you do it?

32:20.000 --> 32:21.900
Revenge of the
Cheerleaders.

32:22.200 --> 32:22.900
We marry the geeks

32:22.900 --> 32:24.200
because they're the ones
with the future.

32:24.200 --> 32:26.400
But my husband wasn't
ambitious enough.

32:26.600 --> 32:29.200
And they were offering
a lot of money.

32:34.600 --> 32:36.000
Who do you work for?
I can help you.

32:38.200 --> 32:39.300
I'm self-employed.

32:39.400 --> 32:41.100
Your name has been at
the top of my list

32:41.100 --> 32:43.000
of 'People who need
good ass-kicking. '

32:48.500 --> 32:50.300
Get in the locker now,
Ratner.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.100
You have three seconds

32:53.100 --> 32:54.900
to tell me
where the plans are.

32:56.700 --> 32:57.600
One...

32:58.200 --> 32:59.000
two...

33:03.800 --> 33:05.900
Agent Carmichael, help!

33:05.900 --> 33:07.100
GREATEST HITS '98
Before I go here's a classic

33:07.100 --> 33:08.700
from 1998.

33:16.600 --> 33:17.500
Help!

33:17.800 --> 33:18.600
Let me out!

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
Hello?

33:43.900 --> 33:45.800
You should've been
suspicious of me right off.

33:45.800 --> 33:47.300
I mean, why would
a girl like me

33:47.300 --> 33:49.800
ever fall in love
with a dorky nerd like him?

33:50.200 --> 33:51.600
You'd be surprised.

34:06.500 --> 34:07.900
Thanks a lot,
Mad Dog.

34:08.000 --> 34:08.699
Always count
on you to be

34:08.699 --> 34:10.199
in the right place
at the right time.

34:12.900 --> 34:13.900
Wh-wha...

34:18.500 --> 34:20.600
I knew you wouldn't let me down,
Agent Carmichael.

34:26.500 --> 34:28.000
Glad I'm not the one
who has to tell Ratner

34:28.000 --> 34:29.900
about his wife's
involvement in all this.

34:30.500 --> 34:32.300
That's why love
is for suckers.

34:32.800 --> 34:33.100
Yeah.

34:33.100 --> 34:34.400
Hey, you seen Sarah
anywhere?

34:35.400 --> 34:36.500
Sucker.

34:42.199 --> 34:43.699
Now, I got to ask.

34:44.500 --> 34:46.400
How'd you wind up working
for the Feds?

34:46.900 --> 34:49.900
I mean, if you had told me
in high school

34:50.000 --> 34:52.300
that Jenny Burton wanted
to grow up to be an agent,

34:52.699 --> 34:55.100
I would've said, "Dream,
jailbird's daughter,

34:55.600 --> 34:56.500
dream. "

34:58.500 --> 34:58.800
Guess you didn't

34:58.800 --> 35:01.100
follow in daddy's
footsteps after all.

35:21.200 --> 35:22.500
Go Cougars.

35:31.300 --> 35:32.800
And the queen
of the class

35:32.800 --> 35:36.600
of 1998's ten-year reunion is...

35:37.000 --> 35:38.600
Jennifer Burton!

35:41.300 --> 35:42.200
Jenny?

35:42.800 --> 35:43.900
Where are you?

35:46.300 --> 35:47.900
There you are!

35:49.500 --> 35:50.800
Come on up here, Jenny.

35:56.700 --> 35:58.400
See you at the
20th, Jenny!

36:13.200 --> 36:13.800
Don't worry.

36:13.800 --> 36:14.700
We'll fix this.

36:14.700 --> 36:16.500
It'll-It'll
be all good.

36:17.700 --> 36:18.700
It'll be all good.

36:54.800 --> 36:55.500
Come on, guys,
we're almost there.

36:55.500 --> 36:57.300
Big Mike's gonna be here
any minute. Let's go!

37:03.100 --> 37:03.500
<i>Listen up,</i>

37:03.500 --> 37:04.700
listen up, listen up.

37:04.900 --> 37:06.800
Um, first of all,
I just

37:06.800 --> 37:08.500
want to acknowledge
that

37:08.500 --> 37:10.100
I know that I'm not
the easiest man

37:10.100 --> 37:13.900
to work for, but I want to thank
you for all your hard work.

37:13.900 --> 37:15.800
And mean it this time.

37:15.900 --> 37:17.300
<i>I mean, guys,</i>

37:17.300 --> 37:21.100
<i>what we've accomplished here
is incredible.</i>

37:21.400 --> 37:23.300
<i>And each and every one of you</i>

37:23.300 --> 37:26.300
is a big bright,
shining star.

37:28.100 --> 37:30.400
Oh, mother crapper,
the fish!

37:46.000 --> 37:46.700
Glue's still a little wet,

37:46.700 --> 37:48.500
but we had no choice, dude.

37:50.700 --> 37:51.500
Morgan.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.600
You did all this for me

37:54.700 --> 37:57.300
when I haven't always been
very kind to you?

37:59.600 --> 38:00.500
May I ask you why?

38:02.400 --> 38:02.900
I don't know, man.

38:02.900 --> 38:05.200
I thought, you know, if I
was there for you selflessly,

38:05.200 --> 38:08.400
that you would see that people
are essentially kind at heart.

38:10.600 --> 38:13.900
You know, and maybe you
wouldn't walk around

38:14.000 --> 38:15.400
so afraid in this world.

38:19.600 --> 38:20.700
Dude, are
you crying?

38:21.100 --> 38:22.600
Come on, I'm just
doing my job.

38:22.600 --> 38:23.700
Oh, Mike's coming.

38:25.100 --> 38:26.700
Work you've done here
is outstanding.

38:26.700 --> 38:29.300
Everyone's on time,
store is tidy.

38:29.300 --> 38:31.000
Even smells like a
pine-scented forest.

38:31.700 --> 38:32.700
Nice touch, Patel.

38:37.800 --> 38:40.200
Will you look
at these sales totals?

38:41.900 --> 38:43.500
With the kind of brisk
business you've done here

38:43.500 --> 38:46.100
in my absence,
I should go away more often.

38:46.100 --> 38:46.500
Sir,

38:46.500 --> 38:48.000
if I might, um,
the truth is that the,

38:48.000 --> 38:49.700
the pressure of management,

38:49.700 --> 38:51.400
it's, it's
just too much.

38:51.800 --> 38:53.800
I would really,
uh, appreciate it

38:53.800 --> 38:56.000
if I could just resume
my former position.

38:57.400 --> 38:58.700
- You sure, son?
- Yes.

38:59.600 --> 39:00.800
Yes, thank you.

39:02.800 --> 39:04.200
What the hell?

39:04.800 --> 39:06.000
<i>Norman!</i>

39:08.600 --> 39:10.700
Isn't that supposed
to be a raw steak?

39:10.700 --> 39:12.700
Not on a Buy More salary,
thank you very much.

39:12.700 --> 39:14.700
I did, however,
scrape together enough cash

39:15.000 --> 39:16.500
to get you a cooked one as well.

39:16.800 --> 39:18.100
Medium rare with...

39:18.100 --> 39:19.800
- Extra pickles?
- extra pickles.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.500
Come on, who do you think
you're dealing with here?

39:22.500 --> 39:23.600
Well, I never doubted you,

39:23.600 --> 39:25.600
Special Agent
Charles Carmichael.

39:26.900 --> 39:28.400
So I guess the big secret
about you

39:28.400 --> 39:31.200
is that you used to be just
a typical high school student.

39:33.700 --> 39:35.300
Wish I knew what happened
to change that.

39:41.300 --> 39:42.800
IN CASE OF EMERGENCY
LOVE YOU, DADDY

40:00.100 --> 40:01.600
Nice toss.

40:02.700 --> 40:03.800
Who are you?

40:04.100 --> 40:06.800
I'm the man who put
your father in prison.

40:10.700 --> 40:13.900
The question is: Who are you?

40:14.800 --> 40:17.500
In San Diego, you
go by Jenny Burton.

40:18.700 --> 40:20.700
In Wisconsin,
it's Katie O'Connell.

40:21.700 --> 40:24.300
In Cleveland, it's
Rebecca Franko.

40:24.900 --> 40:27.100
Funny thing is when I looked
at your birth certificate...

40:27.100 --> 40:28.300
I get your point.

40:28.300 --> 40:29.500
What do you want?

40:30.000 --> 40:32.500
Your father scammed some
pretty dangerous people.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.400
I saved his life by
putting him in jail.

40:36.500 --> 40:38.700
Well, don't expect
a thank-you note.

40:39.600 --> 40:41.500
I can save your life, too.

40:49.800 --> 40:52.000
No, not that way.

40:52.900 --> 40:54.300
Your dad trained
you pretty well.

40:56.500 --> 40:58.300
The CIA can do even better.

41:00.900 --> 41:03.200
You like names so much, hmm?

41:04.200 --> 41:06.100
What do you think
about Sarah Walker?

41:11.700 --> 41:13.300
Sarah Walker,
hello.

41:16.100 --> 41:17.600
Okay, fine.

41:17.700 --> 41:19.700
I'll answer one question
about my past.

41:19.700 --> 41:21.000
You've earned that much.

41:23.200 --> 41:24.600
Hmm.

41:28.900 --> 41:30.000
No, thanks.

41:32.900 --> 41:35.100
I don't need to know more,
not about who you were,

41:36.200 --> 41:39.000
'cause as much as you don't
think so, I know who you are.

41:41.400 --> 41:43.800
A girl I'd like to share
a cheeseburger with.

41:49.700 --> 41:50.600
Should I get a knife?
I'll get

41:50.600 --> 41:52.900
- a knife.
- That won't be necessary.

41:56.000 --> 41:59.200
That's awesome
and a little disturbing.
