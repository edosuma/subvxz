00:13.000 --> 00:17.300
i'm glad you like it.

00:17.300 --> 00:18.900
i love it.

00:21.100 --> 00:22.700
what time is it?

00:24.100 --> 00:25.600
Are you insane? 
Come back to bed.

00:25.600 --> 00:27.000
And miss all the good sunlight?

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
Come on, Ilsa,
it's not like

00:28.000 --> 00:30.100
the civil war is going
to go anywhere.

00:32.299 --> 00:33.300
Tempting.

00:34.100 --> 00:35.200
But I have a deadline.

00:36.300 --> 00:37.100
Yeah...

00:37.800 --> 00:39.500
Why did I ever let myself
get involved

00:39.500 --> 00:40.600
with a photo-journalist?

00:40.600 --> 00:43.100
And how did I get
myself mixed up with a--

00:43.200 --> 00:44.300
what do you call yourself again?

00:44.300 --> 00:45.700
An energy consultant.

00:45.700 --> 00:46.800
What does that even mean?

00:46.800 --> 00:48.900
It means I get to sleep in late.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.600
Here's my offer,
Yeah?

00:50.700 --> 00:53.200
- Mr. Energy Consultant.
- Mm-hmm.

00:53.500 --> 00:56.200
You stay in bed and preserve
your precious energy.

00:59.700 --> 01:01.500
And I'll be back
before you know it.

01:02.900 --> 01:04.300
Bye-bye, Sugar Bear.

02:19.400 --> 02:20.900
 <i>Did you hear a word I said?</i>

02:22.000 --> 02:23.100
 <i>Hello?</i>

02:23.300 --> 02:24.600
Do you speak English?

02:25.100 --> 02:28.100
 <i>Parla usted Inglese?</i>
Hello?

02:29.200 --> 02:29.700
Yeah.

02:29.700 --> 02:30.900
Then why aren't you moving?

02:30.900 --> 02:32.600
Because if you
were listening,

02:32.600 --> 02:36.100
then you'd be walking to the register
to get me my 300 bucks!

02:35.800 --> 02:37.000
Sir, I repeat:

02:37.000 --> 02:40.100
I cannot offer you a refund
without a valid receipt.

02:40.100 --> 02:41.500
You can't give
me a refund,

02:41.600 --> 02:43.100
you won't give
me an exchange.

02:43.100 --> 02:45.000
What exactly are you capable of doing,

02:45.100 --> 02:46.200
Big Johnny?

02:46.200 --> 02:47.800
You sad, impotent oaf?

02:48.800 --> 02:50.700
I'm capable of stopping your heart...

02:50.500 --> 02:52.100
Hey, hey, hey,
whoa, whoa, whoa,

02:52.100 --> 02:54.000
hey john, ??? problem here.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.100
- Let me guess, it's the auto-focus, right?
- Yeah.

02:56.100 --> 02:58.100
Happens all the time.
It's a quick...

02:58.100 --> 03:00.000
quick, quick fix, and I can
take care of it personally.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.200
If you'll just leave
your name and number

03:01.200 --> 03:02.100
at the Nerd Herd desk,

03:02.100 --> 03:03.800
I'll take care of it
in a jiff, okay?

03:04.000 --> 03:06.400
- Was that so hard?
- Thank you. Have a good day.

03:07.700 --> 03:09.900
Just breathe, Casey, breathe.

03:09.900 --> 03:10.800
Breathe... or growl.

03:10.800 --> 03:12.900
Growling also works.
Very good.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Very, very good.

03:15.900 --> 03:16.600
Hey.

03:18.500 --> 03:19.400
You're not going
to believe it.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.400
Oh, you got that
server to work?

03:20.400 --> 03:23.300
I got Tara Reid's phone number.

03:23.600 --> 03:26.600
What have I told you about
stalking "celebrities" online?

03:26.600 --> 03:28.400
And, by the way, who doesn't
have her phone number?

03:29.300 --> 03:30.700
Is that the Grand
Saville's main database?

03:30.700 --> 03:33.900
I can access every guest staying
at L.A.'s swankiest hotel.

03:33.900 --> 03:36.200
It's got it all:
room numbers, credit cards,

03:36.200 --> 03:37.400
spank-per-view records...

03:37.400 --> 03:38.800
That's super, Jeff.
Really good work.

03:38.800 --> 03:40.700
I'll let the hotel know
that their computer's ready.

03:40.700 --> 03:44.900
You're giving away
the holy grail! Tara!

03:45.600 --> 03:47.400
Grand Saville,
please don't sue us.

03:54.500 --> 03:55.800
Dmitry Siljak--

03:56.300 --> 03:57.800
known alias
of black market arms dealer

03:57.800 --> 03:59.700
specializing in former Soviet...

04:16.200 --> 04:18.800
Okay. Man, I'm going to have
a headache tomorrow.

04:27.500 --> 04:28.800
Ilsa Trinchina.

04:29.500 --> 04:32.400
AP photographer, rumored lover
of undercover NSA agent.

04:32.400 --> 04:33.900
Whereabouts unknown.

04:35.300 --> 04:36.400
Sugar Bear?

04:40.100 --> 04:42.300
Sugar Bear's
girlfriend's in town.

04:48.400 --> 04:49.200
Casey, hey, hey, hey!

04:49.200 --> 04:49.900
Wait up! wait up!

04:50.500 --> 04:52.700
I just had the mother lode
of all bad guy flashes.

04:54.500 --> 04:55.900
- Who are they?
- Mostly Russian.

04:55.900 --> 04:58.400
All traveling under aliases,
fake passports.

04:58.700 --> 04:59.800
That means they're
arms dealers,

04:59.800 --> 05:02.100
- money launderers, black market smugglers...
- Yeah.

05:02.100 --> 05:03.600
Apparently, they're all
having a douche bag

05:03.600 --> 05:05.100
convention down
at the Grand Saville.

05:05.100 --> 05:06.200
I'll run it up the flagpole,

05:06.200 --> 05:07.400
see what command wants us to do.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.500
Uh... one more thing.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.100
There was another name,

05:11.200 --> 05:13.100
one name that I flashed on
actually,

05:13.200 --> 05:14.400
but I left it--

05:14.800 --> 05:17.300
her-- off of the list.

05:17.400 --> 05:18.900
What the hell are you talking
about, Bartowski?

05:18.900 --> 05:23.300
Does the name Ilsa Trinchina

05:23.300 --> 05:24.800
mean anything to you...

05:25.400 --> 05:26.600
Sugar Bear?

05:28.400 --> 05:29.900
You say that
name ever again

05:29.900 --> 05:31.200
and I will end you.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.200
Nod if you understand.

05:35.500 --> 05:39.000
Casey... you're hurting
the Intersect.

06:24.800 --> 06:25.400
Hey.

06:25.700 --> 06:27.100
Try this. It's the new

06:27.100 --> 06:28.800
breakfast corndog
with country sausage

06:28.800 --> 06:30.300
and syrup wrapped
in pancake.

06:30.300 --> 06:31.700
Thank you, but maybe
a little bit later.

06:31.700 --> 06:33.200
I have some serious
business to discuss--

06:33.200 --> 06:34.700
matter of national security.

06:34.800 --> 06:36.500
Casey's ex-girlfriend
is in town.

06:36.600 --> 06:37.200
What? How do you know?

06:37.200 --> 06:37.800
I flashed.

06:37.800 --> 06:39.300
Her name is Ilsa Trinchina.

06:39.300 --> 06:40.900
Super-hot,
super-sexy and staying

06:40.900 --> 06:42.700
at the Grand Saville
as we speak.

06:42.700 --> 06:44.100
- Does Casey know?
- Oh, yeah. Almost ripped

06:44.100 --> 06:45.900
my head off; it must've been
a pretty bad break-up.

06:45.900 --> 06:47.400
You know for the longest
time, I always imagined

06:47.400 --> 06:50.300
Casey was built like a Ken doll,
you know, downstairs.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.000
I don't know what kind of woman

06:52.000 --> 06:53.900
would go for a guy like Casey.

06:53.900 --> 06:56.700
I was, uh, I was kind of hoping
you'd help me find out.

06:57.500 --> 06:58.600
Ilsa is a civilian.

06:58.600 --> 06:59.600
She's a foreign national.

06:59.600 --> 07:00.900
The Intersect has,
like, nothing on her

07:00.900 --> 07:02.600
except for some love letters
that now I'll never

07:02.600 --> 07:03.800
be able
to scrub out of my brain.

07:03.800 --> 07:06.100
You want me to go
behind Casey's back,

07:06.400 --> 07:08.400
reallocate CIA resources

07:08.400 --> 07:10.200
and violate this
woman's privacy,

07:10.200 --> 07:12.300
so you can find out
what their story is?

07:12.400 --> 07:14.100
Tell me you're not curious.

07:16.400 --> 07:17.700
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:17.700 --> 07:20.400
I'm Ellie Bartowski.
Chuck's sister.

07:20.800 --> 07:22.100
Oh, yes, of course.

07:22.100 --> 07:24.400
I recognize
Chuck's sensual mouth.

07:25.700 --> 07:26.500
Devon.

07:28.100 --> 07:29.400
- Lester.
- Jeff.

07:29.400 --> 07:31.200
Well, any coworker
of Chuck's is

07:31.200 --> 07:34.800
a guy who can help me
pick some stuff out to buy.

07:36.500 --> 07:37.700
Jeff, Lester, uh...

07:37.800 --> 07:39.300
Why don't you give my guests
a little breathing room?

07:39.300 --> 07:41.800
We have business to discuss.

07:46.800 --> 07:47.600
So?

07:49.100 --> 07:50.500
What can I help you
with today, ma'am?

07:50.500 --> 07:51.900
Well, this year
for our anniversary,

07:51.900 --> 07:54.000
Devon and I are making
a little bit more money...

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
So we decided to buy

07:55.000 --> 07:57.100
one large gift instead
of two smaller ones.

07:57.100 --> 07:57.700
Awesome, right?

07:57.700 --> 08:00.000
Ooh, gives me a chill
when you say it, babe.

08:02.300 --> 08:04.000
Have we settled
on what that item may be?

08:04.300 --> 08:05.000
- Yes.
- Yes.

08:09.400 --> 08:10.400
Beautiful, isn't she?

08:13.800 --> 08:15.000
Beautiful, isn't she?

08:15.800 --> 08:17.300
Think of all the great
things we can watch.

08:17.300 --> 08:19.400
Think of all the great
things we can wash.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
I want you guys to know
that I'm not just a salesman.

08:23.700 --> 08:26.500
I've come to think of myself
as a retail therapist.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.200
Ellie, why do you really
want the television?

08:30.400 --> 08:32.000
So that we can spend
more time together.

08:32.299 --> 08:33.700
Quiet evenings at home,

08:34.000 --> 08:35.299
cuddling on the couch.

08:35.400 --> 08:36.200
That's good.

08:36.299 --> 08:37.700
Good. Devon...

08:39.600 --> 08:41.400
What is really behind
the washer and dryer?

08:42.100 --> 08:43.799
So we can spend
more time together.

08:43.900 --> 08:45.400
- What?
- No more Laundromats.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.500
We come home from a ride
and go onto a run

08:47.500 --> 08:49.000
without worrying
about dirty shorts.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
I never go running with you.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.800
Well, maybe you would
with a drawer full

08:51.800 --> 08:53.300
of clean jog bras, babe.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.000
Oh, sorry. Hold on.

08:56.700 --> 08:57.700
That's the hospital.
I have to go.

08:57.700 --> 08:59.600
What am I supposed to do
about our anniversary gift?

08:59.600 --> 09:02.200
You know what, honey? Why don't
you just surprise me, okay?

09:03.000 --> 09:03.700
Love you.

09:07.300 --> 09:09.300
We received your report, Major.

09:09.400 --> 09:11.600
Ex-KGB, Eastern Bloc thugs,

09:11.600 --> 09:13.300
Russian arms dealers...

09:13.600 --> 09:15.300
Frankly, we're not
used to seeing

09:15.300 --> 09:17.900
this particular crowd
stateside these days.

09:17.900 --> 09:20.000
Least not since President Reagan
won The Cold War, huh, General?

09:20.000 --> 09:22.500
So you want us to infiltrate
the Grand Saville?

09:22.500 --> 09:24.700
The hotel's bar has been booked
for a private party

09:24.700 --> 09:25.600
early this evening.

09:25.600 --> 09:27.200
Fine, I'll clear my schedule,

09:27.200 --> 09:28.600
but just 'cause it's you,
General.

09:28.700 --> 09:31.700
Mr. Bartowski,
it's up to you to tell us

09:31.700 --> 09:34.700
what these criminal agents
are all doing in Los Angeles.

09:34.700 --> 09:37.000
You and Agent Walker
are going undercover.

09:37.100 --> 09:39.200
We need you to press
some Russian flesh,

09:39.200 --> 09:40.700
see what you can flash on.

09:40.800 --> 09:43.000
And, uh... good luck.

09:43.700 --> 09:45.100
So, what about you, Casey?

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
- What about me?
- I don't know.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.400
I just thought
if Sarah and I have to go

09:49.400 --> 09:51.400
to the hotel to press
some Russian flesh,

09:51.400 --> 09:52.500
you might want to drop
in on a certain

09:52.500 --> 09:54.100
somebody whose name
I will not...

09:54.100 --> 09:54.600
- Chuck...
- Okay, fine.

09:54.600 --> 09:56.500
I'll shut up
now. Geez, what?

09:57.200 --> 09:58.200
What is with that guy?

09:58.200 --> 09:59.700
He really doesn't want
to see his ex, does he?

09:59.700 --> 10:00.800
I doubt it.

10:01.600 --> 10:02.800
Ilsa's dead.

10:08.300 --> 10:08.700
 <i>I don't get it.</i>

10:08.700 --> 10:10.100
If Casey's
girlfriend is dead,

10:10.100 --> 10:12.000
who's the Ilsa Trinchina
staying in this hotel?

10:12.000 --> 10:13.700
Probably someone traveling
on a fake passport.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.200
It happens all
the time in Russia.

10:15.200 --> 10:17.600
People die and their
personal info gets recycled.

10:17.600 --> 10:19.000
My God, that's
so horrible.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.800
No wonder Casey's so messed up.

10:21.100 --> 10:22.800
casey, Oh, hey...

10:22.800 --> 10:23.500
Hey, I just-- you know what,

10:23.500 --> 10:25.300
I'm sorry about
what I said earlier.

10:25.300 --> 10:26.600
Drop it, Chuck.
You heard the General.

10:26.600 --> 10:27.900
We've got work to do.

10:28.800 --> 10:30.000
Those are our Russians.

10:31.700 --> 10:33.700
Wait, wait, wait--
this isn't a black tie thing.

10:33.700 --> 10:35.000
I'm way overdressed.

10:36.100 --> 10:37.200
Yeah, lose the jacket.

10:42.700 --> 10:43.600
What's this?

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Yeah, perfect.

10:46.300 --> 10:47.100
You know, it would
have been nice to know

10:47.100 --> 10:49.000
that I was the help
on this mission.

10:49.700 --> 10:51.600
I could have done
some character study.

10:51.700 --> 10:52.900
Recognize
anyone, Chuck?

10:54.500 --> 10:56.200
That's, uh, Dmitry Siljak.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.300
Black market arms dealer.

11:02.200 --> 11:04.600
Sergey "Noodles" Romanov.

11:04.600 --> 11:06.000
Freelance hit man.

11:08.600 --> 11:09.800
Sacha!

11:09.900 --> 11:11.900
Is that you,
my sweet Sacha?

11:12.200 --> 11:13.100
Everybody, meet

11:13.300 --> 11:15.400
fourth cousin
on my mother's side.

11:15.900 --> 11:19.300
Sacha, come and give
your cousin great big hug!

11:19.300 --> 11:21.000
Ow! Ow! Ow!

11:21.000 --> 11:22.100
Hey.

11:23.300 --> 11:24.300
Sacha!

11:25.600 --> 11:27.600
 <i>Da. Da. Da.</i>

11:27.900 --> 11:29.400
Russian. Sacha.

11:30.100 --> 11:31.900
Sacha wants to dance!

11:32.100 --> 11:33.900
No. No, dance, no.
 <i>Nyet, nyet, nyet, nyet.</i>

11:33.900 --> 11:34.800
No.

11:37.400 --> 11:38.800
How much for
the whole night?

11:40.200 --> 11:42.700
Don't touch me again, pig.

11:42.700 --> 11:45.400
Get low! Get low!

11:48.600 --> 11:50.900
We are great dancers,
aren't we, us Russians?

11:50.900 --> 11:52.700
Like-Like Baryshnikov!

11:53.100 --> 11:55.200
 <i>White Nights?</i> Anybody
seen <i>White Nights?</i>

11:56.200 --> 11:57.800
- You like what I was doing?
You like what I was doing?
- Yes. Yes.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.200
We're in
a circle.

11:59.400 --> 12:00.500
Hold hands.

12:15.200 --> 12:18.100
Sacha, you like blonde?

12:19.100 --> 12:20.000
Come here!

12:20.200 --> 12:21.200
Very nice!

12:21.500 --> 12:24.000
She is all
yours, Sacha!

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Oh!

12:27.000 --> 12:28.900
She's here.
Ilsa is here.

12:29.400 --> 12:30.500
What? Are you sure?

12:30.900 --> 12:32.300
Look over there.

12:35.300 --> 12:36.600
Our cover has
been compromised.

12:36.600 --> 12:38.700
- Request team extraction.
- I'm on it.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.200
Ilsa?

12:50.600 --> 12:51.800
Oh, my God.

12:59.100 --> 13:00.400
How are you alive?

13:00.700 --> 13:03.600
No one could have
survived that blast. How did you...?

13:05.900 --> 13:07.500
I'm so sorry.

13:07.800 --> 13:09.100
Why are you sorry?

13:09.200 --> 13:10.500
All I remember is,

13:11.100 --> 13:12.900
I woke up in a hospital
in Grozny

13:12.900 --> 13:14.800
two weeks after the blast.

13:14.900 --> 13:16.900
I couldn't see,
I couldn't hear.

13:17.400 --> 13:20.200
It took another two months
for me to remember my name.

13:22.600 --> 13:24.900
But I never forgot your face.

13:28.200 --> 13:29.500
We're Russian!

13:29.600 --> 13:31.500
Oh. Motherland!

13:33.100 --> 13:34.100
Come with me.

13:34.600 --> 13:35.900
Keep on coming.

13:36.700 --> 13:38.300
You crazy people.

13:38.900 --> 13:39.900
We've got to get
him out of here.

13:39.900 --> 13:41.500
Oh, come on. The guy spent
four years of his life

13:41.500 --> 13:42.700
thinking he'd never
see her again.

13:42.700 --> 13:44.100
His cover has been compromised.

13:44.100 --> 13:45.400
Can't the man live
without a cover

13:45.400 --> 13:46.600
for just a couple of minutes?

13:46.600 --> 13:48.000
Hello, everybody.

13:48.400 --> 13:50.000
How are we doing tonight, huh?

13:57.400 --> 13:58.700
Sarah? Sarah,

13:58.700 --> 14:00.800
I think I know what brought
all the baddies together.

14:01.400 --> 14:02.200
Him.

14:02.500 --> 14:03.600
Victor Federov.

14:03.800 --> 14:05.100
A Russian
oligarch with ties

14:05.100 --> 14:06.300
to everything from the mob

14:06.300 --> 14:08.400
to a plot
to overthrow Parliament.

14:08.500 --> 14:10.600
What brings you to Los Angeles?
Why-Why are you here?

14:10.600 --> 14:12.600
Please, I'd like
to introduce you

14:12.600 --> 14:16.200
to a woman who will make me
the happiest man on earth

14:16.200 --> 14:18.400
by becoming my wife.

14:18.400 --> 14:20.100
Ilsa Trinchina!

14:46.100 --> 14:46.900
Hey, buddy.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
How are you feeling?

14:49.200 --> 14:50.100
How am I feeling?

14:50.100 --> 14:51.900
Yeah, uh, you know,

14:51.900 --> 14:53.000
about last night?

14:54.400 --> 14:55.900
Our mission
was a success.

14:55.900 --> 14:57.000
You I.D.'d Victor
Federov.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Agent Walker's
been assigned

14:58.000 --> 14:59.700
to set up a surveillance
on the target.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.700
In short, I feel
fan-eff'in-tastic.

15:02.200 --> 15:05.400
Well... okay. I-I
mean, I guess, uh,

15:05.400 --> 15:06.700
you know, I was
referring more

15:06.700 --> 15:09.100
to the you and Ilsa
situation.

15:09.900 --> 15:11.300
Thought maybe you'd want
to talk about the fact

15:11.300 --> 15:13.700
that the girl you thought
was dead isn't actually dead.

15:14.500 --> 15:15.400
No.

15:16.100 --> 15:17.400
Great. Good, good.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.400
Really good session here, Casey.

15:19.400 --> 15:20.900
Really feel like
you're making a breakthrough.

15:20.900 --> 15:22.300
Look, I just...
I just want you to know

15:22.300 --> 15:23.700
that I'm a good
listener, okay?

15:23.700 --> 15:25.600
So, if you ever want
to talk about anything.

15:25.700 --> 15:27.000
If you want to use me

15:27.000 --> 15:29.700
as a sounding board
for your emotions, or...

15:34.500 --> 15:35.800
Finding everything okay?

16:06.600 --> 16:07.500
Come on, buddy.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.300
Just give me
something, anything.

16:09.300 --> 16:10.300
Where is she from?

16:10.600 --> 16:11.700
Or where did you two meet?

16:11.700 --> 16:13.200
Why is this so important
to you, Chuck?

16:14.500 --> 16:16.200
Why the hell do you care
so much about me and Ilsa?

16:16.200 --> 16:18.400
I don't... I don't
know, man, okay?

16:18.400 --> 16:19.900
I just... I-I think it
would be nice to know

16:19.900 --> 16:21.600
that you had a life before...

16:23.400 --> 16:24.300
this.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.900
I just figured, if a guy
like you can find love--

16:27.100 --> 16:28.600
no offense, Casey--

16:29.000 --> 16:30.600
then maybe there's
hope for me, too.

16:30.600 --> 16:31.800
Maybe this whole
spy business

16:31.800 --> 16:33.700
isn't as screwed up
as I think it is.

16:35.200 --> 16:36.400
Hmm.

16:36.500 --> 16:38.300
Hmm? That's-That's...
Okay, you know what?

16:38.300 --> 16:39.500
If you want to
go through life

16:39.500 --> 16:41.100
all emotionally-constipated
and alone,

16:41.100 --> 16:42.000
then suit yourself.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.800
I'll let you get back to
protecting the greater good,

16:43.800 --> 16:45.400
you freakin' robot.

16:47.100 --> 16:48.500
I met her
in a flower market.

16:52.100 --> 16:53.100
In Rome.

16:57.100 --> 17:00.400
Ilsa was the most beautiful
thing I'd ever seen.

17:02.100 --> 17:03.300
I knew it.

17:07.500 --> 17:09.200
It's alive!

17:32.100 --> 17:33.800
Yeah! There she
is. There she is.

17:33.800 --> 17:34.600
Hey, you think
Ellie's going

17:34.600 --> 17:36.700
to be cool that you went
with the washer and dryer?

17:36.700 --> 17:37.900
Ah, no worries.

17:39.800 --> 17:40.700
Oh, hey, Babe.

17:40.700 --> 17:42.000
Happy
Anniversary!

17:44.200 --> 17:45.700
You got the washer and dryer.

17:45.700 --> 17:47.200
Well, you told me
to surprise you.

17:47.300 --> 17:48.700
So, surprise!

17:51.200 --> 17:54.500
You getting what you want
isn't a surprise.

17:55.400 --> 17:56.400
What's that supposed to mean?

17:56.400 --> 17:58.900
It means that I would like
to go to brunch,

17:58.900 --> 18:01.700
but you would rather
go rock climbing.

18:01.700 --> 18:04.700
Or I want to go wine
tasting in Napa, but
you would rather

18:04.700 --> 18:07.400
go to Baja and go kite surfing.

18:07.800 --> 18:09.100
It's always about
what you want.

18:09.300 --> 18:10.100
Come on, Babe.

18:10.300 --> 18:11.600
It's just a washer
and dryer.

18:12.600 --> 18:14.700
It's not just a washer
and dryer.

18:14.900 --> 18:16.100
It's about what it represents.

18:16.100 --> 18:17.700
It represents clean clothes.

18:17.700 --> 18:19.500
Have you guys
ever considered...?

18:19.500 --> 18:20.000
- What?
- What?

18:20.000 --> 18:21.300
Well, that maybe,

18:21.300 --> 18:22.500
on an unconscious level,

18:22.500 --> 18:25.300
Devon, uh, has the need
to exercise

18:25.300 --> 18:27.400
or go on these extreme
adventures because,

18:27.400 --> 18:29.800
well, maybe
he's scared of intimacy,

18:30.200 --> 18:31.400
of being tied down.

18:31.600 --> 18:32.700
- Yes! Exactly!
- No!

18:32.700 --> 18:34.100
Ellie, how does that
make you feel?

18:36.600 --> 18:41.300
Like I'm banking on my future
with a giant, muscley child.

18:42.900 --> 18:44.200
And I can't do it anymore.

18:48.400 --> 18:51.000
And, Devon, you--
how do you feel?

18:52.100 --> 18:53.800
Of course, naturally. Sure.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.100
Sure, it was great.

18:56.700 --> 18:59.000
You know, we had what
we had, but it's over.

18:59.900 --> 19:01.100
So, that-that's it?

19:01.600 --> 19:03.300
You're just going to let her
walk back out of your life?

19:03.300 --> 19:05.100
Seems like
the smart play, Chuck.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.200
Nice girls don't marry
corrupt Russian oligarchs.

19:09.200 --> 19:10.200
Well, I hate to
break it to you,

19:10.200 --> 19:11.900
but nice girls don't
go around marrying guys

19:11.900 --> 19:13.100
like you, either.

19:14.200 --> 19:16.200
G-man assassin?
International spy?

19:16.200 --> 19:18.600
I mean, pardon me for
saying it, Casey, but
at least on paper,

19:18.600 --> 19:20.500
you're kind of
an unsavory dude.

19:21.200 --> 19:22.000
Granted.

19:22.800 --> 19:24.400
But Ilsa never knew
what I do for a living.

19:24.400 --> 19:26.000
That's exactly my point.

19:27.400 --> 19:28.900
What if Ilsa doesn't know

19:28.900 --> 19:30.500
what her fiancé Victor does
for a living,

19:30.500 --> 19:31.500
either?

19:33.000 --> 19:33.900
What are you saying I do?

19:33.900 --> 19:35.200
Stick to your
strengths, buddy.

19:35.200 --> 19:36.600
Come on. You're a fighter.

19:36.600 --> 19:38.100
You got to fight for her.

19:40.700 --> 19:42.200
<i>This is a terrible idea, Chuck.</i>

19:42.200 --> 19:43.100
We shouldn't be here.

19:43.100 --> 19:44.200
- Can we just go...?
- Negatory.

19:44.200 --> 19:45.900
We have passed the
point of no return.

19:45.900 --> 19:47.800
- No retreat, soldier.
- This isn't a mission.

19:47.800 --> 19:49.200
We're just two guys
sneaking down a hall

19:49.200 --> 19:50.700
like a couple
of numb nuts.

19:51.800 --> 19:54.400
- Hey.
- What are you two doing here?

19:54.500 --> 19:56.100
I'd like to apologize,
Agent Walker.

19:56.100 --> 19:57.500
Uh, Chuck here convinced me...

19:57.500 --> 19:59.800
To come... to come down to
the hotel, and to bring me,

19:59.800 --> 20:01.300
because I... maybe I
could flash on some stuff.

20:01.300 --> 20:02.800
Some cool stuff or
things or whatever.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.600
You volunteered
to go on an all-night stakeout?

20:05.600 --> 20:06.800
Doesn't sound like me, does it?

20:06.800 --> 20:08.500
I know. But I couldn't sleep.

20:08.600 --> 20:10.800
So I thought
it would do me some good

20:10.800 --> 20:12.200
to-to... to, uh, you know,

20:12.200 --> 20:13.600
look at some surveillance
monitors or something.

20:13.600 --> 20:15.000
Maybe... 
... knock me right out.

20:15.000 --> 20:15.900
So...

20:17.200 --> 20:18.100
This way.

20:22.800 --> 20:25.600
I've already tapped
into the hotel security feed.

20:25.700 --> 20:26.500
You two get comfy.

20:26.500 --> 20:28.100
I'm going to deliver
the surveillance

20:28.100 --> 20:30.800
- to the bridal suite.
- Good bug.

20:30.800 --> 20:32.400
With any luck, we'll get
enough dirt off the wire

20:32.400 --> 20:34.300
to take the target down
on U.S. soil.

20:34.500 --> 20:35.200
Hmm.

20:35.500 --> 20:36.300
Have fun.

20:36.300 --> 20:38.600
Don't wait up. Just going
to be looking at, uh...

20:38.700 --> 20:39.800
...monitors and...

20:46.800 --> 20:47.700
Um, Casey?

20:48.100 --> 20:49.000
What, did you flash?

20:49.000 --> 20:50.300
Look who's hitting the bar
the night before

20:50.300 --> 20:51.400
her own wedding.

20:53.500 --> 20:54.400
Now, does that look
like the face

20:54.400 --> 20:56.100
of a woman who's happy
about getting married?

20:59.100 --> 20:59.900
Where's she going?

21:02.300 --> 21:03.100
Look, look, look, look.

21:03.100 --> 21:04.100
This is your chance, buddy!

21:04.100 --> 21:05.800
This is your chance!
Look at her, Casey.

21:05.800 --> 21:07.400
She's just sitting there
waiting for you.

21:09.200 --> 21:10.100
Wait a second.

21:10.100 --> 21:11.800
You're scared,
aren't you?

21:12.800 --> 21:14.100
Don't be an idiot.

21:16.900 --> 21:19.400
Kemo sabe.
Come on, man, look,

21:19.600 --> 21:20.500
you don't want to
spend the rest

21:20.500 --> 21:22.200
of your life
hating yourself

21:22.200 --> 21:24.600
for what you didn't have
the guts to say tonight.

21:24.600 --> 21:25.900
Okay? Believe me.

21:26.400 --> 21:27.200
I know.

21:39.100 --> 21:39.800
Hey,

21:39.900 --> 21:41.200
this is a private floor.

21:42.600 --> 21:43.700
Ooh.

21:49.100 --> 21:50.500
Casey, you're going to have
to deliver the package.

21:50.500 --> 21:51.900
I've got a body to take care of.

21:52.100 --> 21:53.200
Keys are in the sugar.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.100
Deliver the package?

21:58.700 --> 22:00.000
Casey, do you read me?

22:00.700 --> 22:01.300
Uh...

22:03.100 --> 22:04.600
Yeah, uh, copy that.

22:04.600 --> 22:05.700
On my way.

22:20.200 --> 22:21.600
Bonsoir.

22:21.600 --> 22:23.000
Housekeeping.

22:33.100 --> 22:35.100
Okay. Eenie, meenie,

22:35.500 --> 22:36.600
miney...

22:38.000 --> 22:38.800
moe.

23:07.600 --> 23:08.600
Oh...

23:20.600 --> 23:22.900
These stupid
keys never work.

23:36.100 --> 23:37.400
Come here.

23:39.400 --> 23:40.700
Oh, Casey.

23:41.400 --> 23:42.400
Oh, Ilsa.

23:42.700 --> 23:43.700
I've missed you.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.300
- I missed you.
- i missed you, too.

24:01.200 --> 24:02.200
Bartowski.

24:04.500 --> 24:05.600
What the hell
are you doing here?

24:05.600 --> 24:06.900
Listen, I-I'm, I'm really sorry.

24:06.900 --> 24:10.100
I know this is very awkward,
but Ilsa is a bad girl.

24:10.100 --> 24:11.700
She's a very bad girl.

24:14.600 --> 24:16.200
Drop the gun, Sugar Bear.

24:17.700 --> 24:18.500
See?

24:20.200 --> 24:21.900
Mind telling me
what a nice girl like you

24:21.900 --> 24:23.000
is doing with a gun, Ilsa?

24:23.000 --> 24:24.500
Same thing as
you, Casey.

24:24.700 --> 24:26.400
I tried to warn you;
she's a spy.

24:26.800 --> 24:27.500
Who do you work for?

24:27.500 --> 24:29.600
Why don't you ask your friend?
He's already seen my files.

24:29.600 --> 24:31.500
Uh... yeah, I did.

24:31.500 --> 24:32.700
She's French
Secret Service.

24:32.700 --> 24:34.800
But, but, but wouldn't that
put us all on the same side,

24:34.800 --> 24:35.900
kind of, sort of,
doesn't it?

24:35.900 --> 24:38.200
- You lied to me.
- Says the energy consultant.

24:38.200 --> 24:40.100
What about the bomb
in Grozny?

24:40.400 --> 24:43.100
That "I never forgot
your face" garbage?

24:43.100 --> 24:44.600
Oh, that bomb.

24:44.600 --> 24:47.400
- Ilsa.
- Quick, hide.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.200
You have to trust me.

24:53.300 --> 24:54.300
Ilsa.

24:56.800 --> 24:58.400
Ilsa.

24:58.400 --> 24:59.700
Baby.

25:01.100 --> 25:03.800
Where have you been hiding,
Ilsa?

25:03.800 --> 25:06.300
I can't wait any longer.

25:06.400 --> 25:10.700
How about we start
our honeymoon <i>now?</i>

25:10.700 --> 25:12.900
Oh, Victor.

25:14.800 --> 25:16.700
Don't even think about it;
you don't know who's on top.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
You guys, get out of here
before he wakes up.

25:30.900 --> 25:32.800
All right...
here you go.

25:33.100 --> 25:34.400
Michael,
in or out?

25:35.600 --> 25:37.500
Hey, thanks for letting me join
your game, boys.

25:37.500 --> 25:38.700
Perfect distraction.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.800
Captain here had a fight
with his lady friend.

25:40.800 --> 25:43.600
Oh... the doghouse.

25:44.300 --> 25:46.000
Been there many a time,
my friend.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.700
- No, you haven't.
- Guys,

25:47.700 --> 25:50.100
Ellie and I are just going
through a little rough patch.

25:50.100 --> 25:51.100
- Both trying to figure...
-Let me share

25:51.100 --> 25:54.300
- one thing that I know from personal experience.
- No, you don't.

25:54.300 --> 25:57.200
You do not need some broad
holding your maracas

25:57.300 --> 25:58.500
in a vise.

25:58.700 --> 26:00.500
Yeah,
man-cake like you,

26:00.700 --> 26:03.600
you should install a turnstile
on your bedroom door.

26:04.400 --> 26:05.300
Yeah.

26:06.200 --> 26:06.800
- Huh.
- So...

26:06.800 --> 26:07.900
in or out?

26:10.600 --> 26:13.500
All right...
I have absolutely nada.

26:13.500 --> 26:14.600
- Pair of threes.
- I missed my straight.

26:14.600 --> 26:16.900
- Busted flush.
- Trip nines, gentlemen.

26:18.200 --> 26:20.000
- Big man.
- Daddy takes it home.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
Fine, all right,
rules is rules.

26:24.400 --> 26:25.800
This is what's great
about boys' night.

26:25.800 --> 26:27.900
Hey, man-cake,
what do you think?

26:27.900 --> 26:30.500
Want to do this again
tomorrow, single guy?

26:30.500 --> 26:32.900
I got a surgery I got to do.

26:33.900 --> 26:34.500
Dude, we
want to take

26:34.500 --> 26:35.800
your pants off.

26:37.200 --> 26:40.400
Oh, we got to get
that guy's pants off.

26:43.700 --> 26:44.800
And then?

26:45.200 --> 26:46.400
It wasn't long after
we were married

26:46.400 --> 26:48.800
that Victor went back
to Czechoslovakia.

26:49.200 --> 26:50.000
Hey, Casey,

26:50.000 --> 26:50.600
we need to talk.

26:50.600 --> 26:53.100
- Is it related to last night?
- Uh...

26:53.100 --> 26:54.500
- well, yeah.
- Then I don't want

26:54.500 --> 26:55.200
to talk about it.

26:55.200 --> 26:57.200
- Listen, Casey.
- No, you listen.

26:57.500 --> 26:58.400
Whatever you
thought existed

26:58.400 --> 27:00.600
between me and Ilsa, you
were wrong, all right?

27:00.600 --> 27:02.500
That person has gone
back to being dead to me.

27:02.900 --> 27:04.100
You have something
to say, Chuck?

27:04.100 --> 27:07.600
Yeah, just that there's a
dead lady waiting to see you.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.700
How did you find me, Ilsa?

27:24.900 --> 27:26.600
Your friend left
this under the bed.

27:27.500 --> 27:28.800
He's not much
of a spy.

27:31.800 --> 27:32.800
So what do you want?

27:33.300 --> 27:34.000
I didn't want
to leave things

27:34.000 --> 27:35.400
the way we left
them last night.

27:35.400 --> 27:38.100
With you getting plowed
by a drunk Russian crime boss?

27:38.100 --> 27:39.400
You should get used
to that.

27:41.300 --> 27:43.000
We've been investigating
Victor Federov

27:43.000 --> 27:45.900
since the Paris commuter
train bombings back in '02.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.200
My agency has tried everything
to take him to trial,

27:48.600 --> 27:50.200
but his organization
is airtight,

27:50.300 --> 27:52.100
totally legit
from the outside.

27:52.400 --> 27:53.900
The only way we could
take him down was...

27:53.900 --> 27:56.800
By screwing it out of him?
How, uh...

27:57.400 --> 27:58.200
French.

27:58.500 --> 27:59.500
If you are French.

27:59.700 --> 28:01.000
- Casey, please...
- I make one call

28:01.000 --> 28:03.500
and you, Victor,
and half the Grand Saville

28:03.600 --> 28:04.700
are packed on a plane,

28:04.700 --> 28:07.300
shipped off to the nearest
detention center of my choice.

28:07.300 --> 28:08.300
You're not going
to do that.

28:08.300 --> 28:11.100
Really?
Why is that?

28:11.100 --> 28:12.800
That would be
unprofessional.

28:13.400 --> 28:14.600
And that's not you.

28:17.900 --> 28:19.600
I wish things
could be different.

28:23.200 --> 28:24.600
I'm sorry, Casey.

28:31.900 --> 28:32.800
Good-bye.

28:54.700 --> 28:56.600
A lot of Scotch
and a little Neil.

28:57.500 --> 28:58.600
Everything
okay, buddy?

28:58.800 --> 29:00.900
Just enjoying myself
a little R & R.

29:01.800 --> 29:02.800
Mm-hmm.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.200
- Want a drink?
- No, no.

29:04.200 --> 29:05.700
Thanks, though,
I really appreciate it.

29:06.500 --> 29:09.300
No, just, uh, just thought
I'd check in on you, you know,

29:09.300 --> 29:11.600
what with Ilsa getting married
in an hour and...

29:11.600 --> 29:13.000
Thanks for reminding me.

29:14.400 --> 29:17.500
Here's to John Casey
dodging another bullet.

29:19.900 --> 29:21.700
It's not
like I want the wife and kids

29:21.700 --> 29:24.200
and the Little League practice
and the minivan

29:24.200 --> 29:26.800
and the Costco runs
on the weekend.

29:27.600 --> 29:29.300
Yeah, really, you don't?

29:29.300 --> 29:30.700
'Cause I-- it, it seems to me

29:30.700 --> 29:33.100
that you'd kind of be
into the whole American Dream.

29:33.300 --> 29:34.100
Nah.

29:36.600 --> 29:37.900
I do what I do...

29:38.200 --> 29:40.400
so all those other slobs
out there can have it.

29:41.100 --> 29:43.200
What, uh, what would you say
your dream is?

29:44.900 --> 29:46.000
You're looking at it.

29:56.600 --> 29:57.900
- Sarah.
- Hi.

29:57.900 --> 29:59.600
Hi, I'm so glad you're here.

29:59.600 --> 30:00.300
Uh, yeah,

30:00.300 --> 30:01.500
- me, too.
- Uh, I'm having

30:01.500 --> 30:02.800
a little... a little wine.

30:02.800 --> 30:04.000
- You want some?
- Uh...

30:04.000 --> 30:06.700
I'm actually fine,
but you go ahead.

30:06.700 --> 30:07.700
Okay.

30:08.600 --> 30:10.000
Um, is Chuck here?

30:10.000 --> 30:10.500
Uh-uh.

30:10.500 --> 30:13.400
No, it's, um, it's just,
just me tonight,

30:13.400 --> 30:16.800
um, all, all by myself.

30:18.200 --> 30:19.100
Oh.

30:19.200 --> 30:22.300
Um, are you okay?

30:22.300 --> 30:24.400
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

30:25.000 --> 30:25.800
Okay.

30:32.600 --> 30:34.200
Ellie, are you
sure you're okay?

30:34.200 --> 30:37.100
It's just that...
I have both feet in

30:37.200 --> 30:39.000
and Devon
only has one foot in,

30:39.000 --> 30:41.900
so then it's just me
taking care of three feet

30:42.100 --> 30:43.400
and I want it
to be us,

30:43.400 --> 30:44.700
you know,
taking care of four feet.

30:44.700 --> 30:46.000
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

30:46.200 --> 30:47.200
Completely.

30:47.300 --> 30:49.200
Of course you do.

30:49.200 --> 30:51.600
- I'm going to go get us
some more wine.
- Okay.

30:54.500 --> 30:55.500
Besides, Chuck,

30:55.900 --> 30:58.100
it's not like Ilsa left me
empty-handed.

30:58.300 --> 30:59.400
- What's that?
- Mm...

30:59.400 --> 31:03.000
just a cheap little trinket
I used to think meant something.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.300
You mind telling
me what that is?

31:21.300 --> 31:24.500
It's an RX-77 long-range
audio transmitter.

31:24.500 --> 31:25.900
Someone was listening in
on Ilsa?

31:25.900 --> 31:27.700
- With a Russian-made bug.
- That means

31:27.700 --> 31:28.900
they heard last night.

31:30.900 --> 31:32.500
That means
Victor knows she's a spy.

31:33.700 --> 31:35.600
Whoa, uh, hey, Ca-Casey,
Casey, Casey, Casey.

31:35.600 --> 31:37.300
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
where are you going?

31:37.600 --> 31:39.200
- To stop a wedding, Chuck.
- No, no, no.

31:39.200 --> 31:40.200
No, you're not, no, you're not.

31:40.200 --> 31:42.900
Scotch and driving--
very, very bad combo

31:42.900 --> 31:45.400
and as far as I know,
also illegal.

31:46.700 --> 31:47.800
You're absolutely right.

31:48.500 --> 31:49.300
you're driving.

31:51.600 --> 31:52.700
I need pants.

31:56.100 --> 31:58.200
Ho, hi, hey,
hey, hey, hey.

31:58.200 --> 31:59.100
What's going on, Chuck?

31:59.100 --> 32:00.800
Hey, Victor planted a bug
on Ilsa.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.100
He knows she's a spy.

32:02.200 --> 32:03.200
She's walking into a trap.

32:03.200 --> 32:03.800
this way.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.600
Okay, uh, I'll see you soon.

32:07.100 --> 32:08.700
Uh, Ellie,
I hate to do this to you.

32:08.700 --> 32:10.400
No, no, no, no, no.
No, we were just going to...

32:10.700 --> 32:11.400
we were going
to talk about Chuck

32:11.400 --> 32:12.800
and where you see that going...

32:12.800 --> 32:14.300
You know, we're going
to talk about this

32:14.300 --> 32:15.700
as soon as I get back.

32:17.100 --> 32:18.000
Devon?

32:18.000 --> 32:19.200
Oh, I was just
looking for...

32:19.900 --> 32:21.400
Oh, hey, what's going
on here, ladies?

32:21.400 --> 32:23.100
Having ourselves
a little cocktail?

32:23.100 --> 32:25.400
Sarah, please...
please don't leave tonight.

32:25.400 --> 32:27.000
I just really can't be alone
right now.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.600
- Please.
- Uh... Morgan?

32:28.600 --> 32:31.000
Ellie's feeling a
little, uh... upset.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.400
So, if you could just...

32:32.400 --> 32:33.400
Absolutely. Got it.
I'm your man.

32:33.400 --> 32:34.200
Okay.

32:34.700 --> 32:36.100
Ellie, I'll talk
to you soon.

32:37.600 --> 32:40.300
Hey, hey, easy, easy, El.

32:40.700 --> 32:41.900
Ole Morgan's here now.

32:41.900 --> 32:43.700
I'm not gonna leave
your side, I promise.

32:47.200 --> 32:49.000
You've always been
really sweet to me.

32:49.000 --> 32:49.900
Ah... come on.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.700
I thought we issued a "no
touch" policy back in '98.

32:57.600 --> 32:58.900
Hmm? Remember that?

33:00.600 --> 33:01.500
Buddy?

33:02.300 --> 33:05.000
This is not how I imagined it
over and over, but...

33:05.800 --> 33:07.000
let's get you to bed, huh?

33:07.500 --> 33:08.200
Come on.

33:09.500 --> 33:10.500
Come on, there.

33:11.400 --> 33:12.400
Come on, old girl.

33:14.300 --> 33:16.800
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

33:24.700 --> 33:25.600
Where did you
get that?

33:25.600 --> 33:26.400
Shh.

33:29.900 --> 33:31.500
Ilsa. Ilsa...

33:34.400 --> 33:36.200
I assume you're
with the bride's party?

33:43.400 --> 33:45.700
Ow! Ow, that's tight.

33:45.700 --> 33:47.500
You make
for a handsome groom.

33:47.500 --> 33:49.200
It's a shame
to ruin the suit.

33:49.200 --> 33:50.500
Ruin it how, exactly?
How would you ruin it?

33:50.500 --> 33:52.000
With bullet holes
or blood or...?

33:52.000 --> 33:53.400
Shut up, Chuck.
Shutting up.

33:54.200 --> 33:54.800
Where's Ilsa?

33:54.800 --> 33:56.000
Waiting at the ceremony.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.400
Quite a woman, huh?

33:57.400 --> 33:58.400
I'm going to miss her.

33:58.400 --> 33:59.100
Oh, well.

33:59.100 --> 34:00.900
At least we get to enjoy
wedding night, huh?

34:00.900 --> 34:01.900
Leave her out of this.

34:01.900 --> 34:03.600
I have another proposal.

34:03.700 --> 34:08.000
I was so moved by listening
to you and Ilsa say good-bye,

34:08.300 --> 34:11.800
what if I told you
you get to keep the girl?

34:11.800 --> 34:13.100
Casey, you want to tell
me what's going on?

34:13.100 --> 34:17.400
In fact, how would you and Ilsa
like to go on my honeymoon?

34:17.400 --> 34:19.400
I love that idea.
I don't even have to go.

34:19.900 --> 34:21.800
You mean let me die
in your place?

34:21.900 --> 34:24.000
What'd you have in mind, Victor,
a plane crash

34:24.000 --> 34:27.400
over the Pacific, a fiery wreck
that leaves nothing behind

34:27.400 --> 34:29.300
but our two charred corpses?

34:29.400 --> 34:30.300
Three corpses.

34:30.400 --> 34:33.800
Your friend will play
the role of pilot,

34:34.199 --> 34:36.900
or maybe one of those
man-stewardesses?

34:37.800 --> 34:39.100
If you'll excuse me,

34:39.400 --> 34:42.100
my associates have come
to see me married.

34:42.100 --> 34:43.800
I would hate
to disappoint them.

34:45.199 --> 34:46.800
You guys...

35:02.800 --> 35:05.000
Casey, I don't want to die
as a man-stewardess.

35:05.000 --> 35:05.900
Relax.

35:06.500 --> 35:08.300
I think I see a scenario
where we both get out of here

35:08.300 --> 35:09.800
with acceptable losses.

35:11.300 --> 35:13.800
What exactly is your version
of acceptable?

35:13.800 --> 35:15.900
Breaks and punctures,
possible loss of a limb,

35:15.900 --> 35:17.300
no major organ damage.

35:38.100 --> 35:39.700
Hey, Comrades.

35:40.300 --> 35:42.000
Mind if I ask you two fellas
a question?

35:48.100 --> 35:49.400
Where did you learn
to tie people up,

35:49.400 --> 35:51.200
a <i>Rocky and Bullwinkle</i> cartoon?

35:51.400 --> 35:53.500
I don't think that you're
helping right now.

35:53.800 --> 35:54.600
Hello?

35:57.200 --> 35:59.200
No wonder you lost the Cold War.

35:59.300 --> 36:02.000
A couple of Girl Scouts could
tie people up better than this.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.200
Casey, what are you...?

36:03.900 --> 36:04.900
Whoa!

36:07.800 --> 36:10.200
Like you said, Chuck,
I'm sticking to my strengths.

36:10.200 --> 36:11.800
How many times do we have
to go through this?

36:14.800 --> 36:16.400
Where's Chuck Bartowski?

36:20.200 --> 36:21.100
That had to hurt.

36:24.700 --> 36:26.100
Baddie at six o'clock.

36:28.800 --> 36:31.300
Oh! How you like me now, sucka?

36:36.000 --> 36:38.500
Ooh, Cas... Casey?
Casey! Casey!

36:42.400 --> 36:44.600
High... very...
it's so very high!

36:48.000 --> 36:49.100
Get 'em! Get 'em!

36:49.100 --> 36:50.800
Oh! Casey!

36:53.000 --> 36:54.100
I can't hold us.

36:54.600 --> 36:56.100
I have very weak thighs.

36:56.300 --> 36:56.900
Casey!

36:58.200 --> 36:59.100
Last chance.

36:59.100 --> 37:00.500
Where's Chuck Bartowski?

37:42.200 --> 37:44.300
Hope I'm not too late
to object to this union.

37:46.900 --> 37:49.200
Take these two to my plane

37:49.500 --> 37:50.400
and strangle them.

37:50.400 --> 37:51.700
They're not going anywhere.

37:52.900 --> 37:53.700
Really?

37:53.900 --> 37:55.200
Who's gonna stop me?

37:55.400 --> 37:56.100
One little girl

37:56.100 --> 37:58.000
with one little gun?

38:04.800 --> 38:06.300
Casey, this is
unacceptable.

38:06.300 --> 38:07.300
Shut up, Chuck.

38:12.200 --> 38:13.400
Try two little girls.

38:14.300 --> 38:15.700
She looks good with a gun.

38:33.300 --> 38:35.000
Morgan! Morgan!

38:35.000 --> 38:36.700
Damn, Mom,
I got my headgear on.

38:36.700 --> 38:38.600
Wake up. Wake up.

38:38.800 --> 38:39.800
Oh, thank God.

38:40.600 --> 38:42.500
Oh, thank God.
Oh, God.

38:42.900 --> 38:44.100
What are you
doing in here?

38:44.600 --> 38:45.600
What are you...
what are you talking about?

38:45.600 --> 38:47.200
You begged me not to leave.

38:47.900 --> 38:50.900
Ow. Okay.

38:51.400 --> 38:52.100
There's um...

38:52.800 --> 38:54.500
oh, there's aspirin on
your side of the...

38:55.300 --> 38:56.200
that side of the bed.

38:56.200 --> 38:57.800
If you could get
me six, please?

38:57.900 --> 39:01.300
Yeah. Anything you, uh,
anything you need.

39:03.400 --> 39:04.100
Here.

39:05.500 --> 39:07.300
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

39:07.400 --> 39:08.400
For last night.

39:09.700 --> 39:10.700
You know nothing happened.

39:10.700 --> 39:12.100
Mostly thanks for that.

39:13.500 --> 39:16.100
Look, Ellie, I would pretty much
do anything for you.

39:16.100 --> 39:18.600
You're kind of like
a sister to me.

39:22.300 --> 39:23.800
A sister I want
to have sex with so bad.

39:23.800 --> 39:25.000
Oh, God, Morgan.

39:25.300 --> 39:27.400
Whoa! Hey, big guy.
What's up, man?

39:27.400 --> 39:29.100
Nothing-nothing
happening over here.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.600
Just kind of...
Not the face!

39:30.800 --> 39:32.200
Honey, come here.

39:32.200 --> 39:33.300
I want to show
you something.

39:38.400 --> 39:39.700
Happy Anniversary, baby.

39:39.900 --> 39:40.600
Devon.

39:40.600 --> 39:42.800
I'm sorry I got
so mad at you.

39:43.600 --> 39:44.600
No, you were right.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.100
I was being selfish.

39:46.400 --> 39:48.800
I got a glimpse of what my life
would be like without you.

39:49.600 --> 39:50.600
Not a pretty picture.

39:54.200 --> 39:55.100
Uh, dude?

39:55.600 --> 39:57.100
I feel like I owe you
an explanation,

39:57.100 --> 39:59.500
and I want you to know
that nothing happened

39:59.500 --> 40:01.200
between me and your lady
last night, I swear.

40:01.200 --> 40:02.000
I know, man.

40:02.700 --> 40:03.500
What... wait.

40:03.500 --> 40:04.500
What do you mean
"you know, man"?

40:04.500 --> 40:06.400
You don't think there exists
a scenario where Ellie,

40:06.400 --> 40:07.600
devastated over her loss of you,

40:07.600 --> 40:10.300
comes into my arms
for the conso-lovin' prize?

40:10.400 --> 40:11.300
Think about it.

40:12.300 --> 40:13.000
No.

40:16.200 --> 40:18.100
It was good
working with you, Casey.

40:18.200 --> 40:19.100
You, too.

40:36.400 --> 40:37.700
What does he think
he's doing?

40:38.100 --> 40:39.700
Guess he's trying
to spy on us.

40:39.800 --> 40:41.900
- He's got a lot to learn.
- Mm-hmm.

40:42.800 --> 40:43.700
Well, I've got to go.

40:44.100 --> 40:45.200
Victor's waiting
at the airport

40:45.200 --> 40:47.900
at a holding cell.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.700
His extradition papers
just came in.

40:51.700 --> 40:53.600
Well, you lovebirds
have a safe flight.

40:55.100 --> 40:56.500
Sorry you had to
blow your cover.

40:57.400 --> 40:58.400
I'm gonna miss Ilsa.

40:58.400 --> 40:59.700
I'm sure I'll find a new one.

40:59.700 --> 41:01.400
I hope to meet her someday.

41:03.300 --> 41:04.100
Well...

41:06.100 --> 41:08.400
you better get going or you're
going to miss your flight.

41:18.100 --> 41:18.900
Good-bye, Ilsa.

41:21.200 --> 41:22.100
Good-bye, Casey.

41:25.100 --> 41:25.800
Hey.

41:27.300 --> 41:28.300
Just so you know.

41:29.600 --> 41:30.900
I'm happy you're not dead.

41:43.700 --> 41:44.900
What's up, killer?

41:45.700 --> 41:48.400
You got yourself a new special
lady-friend, or what?

41:49.800 --> 41:51.200
She's hopping a plane.

41:51.400 --> 41:53.200
What? Are you serious?

41:53.700 --> 41:55.000
You guys gonna
stay in touch?

41:56.500 --> 41:58.000
She's going back undercover.

41:58.200 --> 41:59.800
Wow, that really sucks.

42:00.200 --> 42:01.600
It's a spy's life, Chuck.

42:03.100 --> 42:04.400
Well, don't you worry, buddy.

42:05.100 --> 42:07.200
You'll always have me,
I'm not going anywhere.

42:08.800 --> 42:09.600
Uh-huh.

42:13.400 --> 42:14.200
Well, Casey,

42:15.400 --> 42:18.100
I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

42:19.900 --> 42:20.600
Hey!

42:24.800 --> 42:25.600
Or not.
