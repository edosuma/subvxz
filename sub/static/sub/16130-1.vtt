00:13.366 --> 00:24.374
Subtitles by demonseye

02:56.000 --> 02:58.594
of my destiny
and the beginning of yours.

02:58.636 --> 03:00.433
When you first
came to me,

03:00.471 --> 03:04.669
you were the most undisciplined
youth I had ever laid eyes on.

03:04.708 --> 03:07.392
And yet, you proved
yourself worthy

03:07.427 --> 03:09.018
to be the next guardian.

03:09.210 --> 03:13.040
You have fulfilled
the Three Noble Prophecies.

03:13.083 --> 03:15.574
You defeated an army
of enemies,

03:15.619 --> 03:18.349
while a flock of cranes
circled above.

03:18.389 --> 03:22.485
And then... you battled for love
in the palace of jade.

03:22.526 --> 03:23.636
And finally,

03:23.863 --> 03:25.875
you freed brothers
you never knew...

03:26.397 --> 03:27.629
with the family you never had.

03:27.664 --> 03:30.104
Now you must make
the final sacrifice.

03:30.139 --> 03:31.680
You must give up
your name.

03:31.969 --> 03:34.275
I have already
forgotten it, master.

03:43.387 --> 03:45.565
The Scroll of the Ultimate.

03:46.917 --> 03:49.812
Whoever reads its words
out loud in their entirety

03:49.847 --> 03:52.462
will gain the power
to control the world

03:52.497 --> 03:56.226
and turn it into a paradise
or a living hell.

03:57.526 --> 04:00.129
Mankind is not ready
for so much power

04:00.164 --> 04:01.691
and may never be.

04:01.828 --> 04:04.746
That is why it is our duty
to protect the Scroll

04:04.781 --> 04:07.665
from being read by anyone,
including ourselves.

04:09.499 --> 04:12.119
Five times the Year
of the Ram has passed

04:12.154 --> 04:16.211
since I became The Next
from my honored predecessor

04:16.245 --> 04:20.269
and his master before him,
and so on, and so on.

04:20.325 --> 04:23.403
I have been protecting
the Scroll for sixty years.

04:23.438 --> 04:25.222
Now it is your turn.

05:42.034 --> 05:43.085
It... is done.

05:52.094 --> 05:55.846
The next sixty years should be
very interesting for you.

06:07.458 --> 06:10.479
It's time for me to do what
I've always wanted to do

06:10.619 --> 06:14.687
ever since those pesky British
showed up in 1904.

06:14.965 --> 06:16.168
What's that, master?

06:17.046 --> 06:18.807
Take a vacation.

06:30.825 --> 06:32.106
Scroll...

06:32.135 --> 06:34.183
You must protect Scroll.

06:34.218 --> 06:36.917
Master! Master!

06:50.100 --> 06:52.735
Stay hidden,
no matter what. Go!

07:02.695 --> 07:04.507
My brother monks...

07:05.124 --> 07:07.349
you have seen
the destructive power

07:07.384 --> 07:09.843
which is mine to command.

07:13.257 --> 07:15.667
I also have the power...

07:18.028 --> 07:22.761
to leave this blessed monastery
in peace.

07:22.800 --> 07:25.199
Enjoy your vacation, master.

07:25.969 --> 07:31.228
I trust you will do
what's best for all of us...

07:32.276 --> 07:34.123
and step aside.

07:35.112 --> 07:36.806
No?

07:48.192 --> 07:49.523
Fire!

07:58.202 --> 07:59.604
The Scroll.

08:25.060 --> 08:27.496
Okay, let's go in.

08:38.275 --> 08:39.741
Anybody home?

08:45.516 --> 08:48.217
I don't like monkeys.

09:26.190 --> 09:27.452
The Scroll.

09:29.307 --> 09:33.464
You may be good,
but you are not bulletproof.

10:38.418 --> 10:39.658
Monk?

10:40.338 --> 10:41.481
Monk!

10:44.677 --> 10:45.690
Monk!

10:46.741 --> 10:47.672
Monk!

11:09.893 --> 11:11.836
Rush hour.

11:21.171 --> 11:23.148
I'm sorry. I'll get that.
I'm sorry.

11:24.541 --> 11:25.872
No problem.

11:33.083 --> 11:34.516
Sorry.

11:40.991 --> 11:44.209
You picked the wrong pocket
to pick, prick!

11:46.229 --> 11:48.322
Sorry about that, officer.

11:54.871 --> 11:56.065
Nice cuffs.

11:59.142 --> 12:00.232
Officer needs assistance.

12:00.363 --> 12:02.551
<i>Six-foot Caucasian male,
black leather jacket,</i>

12:02.586 --> 12:03.882
<i>heading north Bishop Square.</i>

12:03.917 --> 12:05.072
On my way.

12:13.390 --> 12:14.618
Do you see him?

12:16.526 --> 12:18.090
Yep. Got him.

12:19.730 --> 12:22.563
<i>Get into position.
Wait for my move.</i>

12:22.599 --> 12:25.098
<i>Confirming visual on the target.
I got him at nine o'clock.</i>

12:25.452 --> 12:26.805
<i>Pick him up.
We have a go.</i>

12:27.295 --> 12:28.645
<i>Approaching target now.</i>

12:29.039 --> 12:31.190
- Hey!
- Go, go, go!

12:31.341 --> 12:33.735
<i>The target is on the run.
Don't let him get away!</i>

12:37.732 --> 12:39.772
Hey! Stop!

12:40.050 --> 12:42.162
<i>Bishop Square platform.
Officer in pursuit!</i>

12:52.763 --> 12:53.855
Hey, man, what's up?

12:55.765 --> 12:57.111
Out of my way, punk!

13:13.016 --> 13:14.118
Coming through!

13:15.986 --> 13:17.196
Get out of the way!

13:18.822 --> 13:19.637
Katie!

13:20.393 --> 13:23.389
- Oh, mommy!
- Somebody get her!

13:26.537 --> 13:27.456
Katie!

13:29.332 --> 13:31.402
Let's get out of here.
Let's go!

13:32.602 --> 13:33.796
Somebody help.

13:35.486 --> 13:37.907
She's stuck. Grab her leg.

13:38.808 --> 13:40.830
- Mommy.
- It'll be okay.

13:40.929 --> 13:42.022
Do it!

13:42.746 --> 13:44.436
Oh, my God!
Get her out of there!

13:52.889 --> 13:54.296
Get ready to pull!

14:10.540 --> 14:12.741
You son of a bitch.
You just lost my whole stash.

14:12.776 --> 14:15.031
Be happy.
You helped save a human life.

14:15.066 --> 14:18.077
Yeah? Well, last time I checked,
there's no reward for that.

14:18.882 --> 14:21.059
Tell me, how did you do that
back there?

14:21.218 --> 14:22.238
Practice.

14:23.854 --> 14:25.852
Who the hell are you,
anyway?

14:26.990 --> 14:29.091
That's not the question
you need to ask.

14:29.126 --> 14:31.193
You should be asking
yourself who you are.

14:31.629 --> 14:34.515
Your mind is filled
with compassion.

14:34.572 --> 14:37.098
That's why you risked your life
to help the child.

14:37.133 --> 14:39.196
But your mind
is also impure.

14:39.325 --> 14:41.319
So you forget
the spiritual reward

14:41.354 --> 14:43.314
and think only
of the financial.

14:43.507 --> 14:44.573
Well, if you're so pure,

14:44.853 --> 14:46.950
why were all those guys
in suits chasing you?

14:46.985 --> 14:48.029
It doesn't concern you.

14:48.064 --> 14:50.820
Let me guess:
FBI, CIA, INS...

14:50.855 --> 14:53.577
I said...
it doesn't concern you.

15:01.291 --> 15:02.553
Unbelievable.

15:04.992 --> 15:06.798
I'm sorry!

15:11.434 --> 15:14.604
Every man's life
concerns every other man.

15:15.299 --> 15:17.560
Especially if
he is on the noble path

15:17.595 --> 15:20.205
to true enlightenment.

15:22.837 --> 15:25.766
Can you accept
my apology?

15:30.554 --> 15:32.367
Apology accepted.

15:32.656 --> 15:35.416
- Thanks for helping me.
- No problem, man.

15:51.441 --> 15:54.115
You're boosting
in the wrong turf!

16:06.957 --> 16:09.136
Get your punk ass
over here.

16:09.171 --> 16:11.462
Finger-man here
calls himself Kar.

16:11.728 --> 16:14.823
Got caught ripping off marks
at the Bishop Square subway station.

16:14.858 --> 16:16.137
Funktastic's the name...

16:17.300 --> 16:18.790
and profit's the game.

16:18.835 --> 16:20.136
See, I'm a businessman...

16:20.364 --> 16:24.524
and my fiscal policy towards
crime consists of two words:

16:26.009 --> 16:27.320
zero tolerance.

16:27.744 --> 16:31.669
Unless, of course, the criminal in question
has an officially authorized franchise.

16:31.772 --> 16:33.079
And you ain't got one.

16:33.180 --> 16:35.404
I'm supposed to pay you for
the right to rip people off?

16:35.439 --> 16:37.942
- That's right.
- 60% off the top.

16:38.037 --> 16:39.503
This entitles you
to squatter's rights

16:39.538 --> 16:41.122
in Mr. Funktastic's cribs,

16:41.307 --> 16:43.255
chow at his greasy spoons

16:43.290 --> 16:48.428
and protection provided
by Mr. Funktastic and his crew.

16:49.666 --> 16:51.531
And that's us.

16:51.915 --> 16:55.141
You know,
it's really enticing.

16:55.714 --> 16:58.421
But if this is an example
of a Funktastic crib,

16:58.895 --> 17:01.645
I'm gonna check myself
into a Motel 6.

17:04.047 --> 17:04.922
That's good.

17:06.432 --> 17:07.762
Pretty funny.

17:08.952 --> 17:11.085
You'd be a corpse already,
mate, if not for the fact

17:11.119 --> 17:12.992
I heard you're
an exceptionally good earner.

17:14.027 --> 17:15.428
Maybe I heard wrong.

17:15.463 --> 17:17.740
In which case,
you're nothing to me, mate.

17:17.973 --> 17:19.402
You're less than nothing.

17:19.436 --> 17:22.805
Around here,
less than nothing means dead.

17:24.619 --> 17:26.210
You heard right
about me.

17:26.300 --> 17:29.035
I just, uh, I-I need some time
to think over your offer.

17:29.070 --> 17:31.608
In the meantime,
take this.

17:32.004 --> 17:33.415
It's okay.

17:35.078 --> 17:37.022
An offer of good faith.

17:39.638 --> 17:43.960
What do you think I am,
Kar, a bloody tourist?

17:46.751 --> 17:47.971
You come down here
and try to palm

17:48.006 --> 17:50.925
that made-in-a-Bangkok-sweatshop
piece of shit off on me?

18:11.614 --> 18:13.235
You got big orchestras, mate.

18:14.376 --> 18:16.011
Too bad
I have to cut 'em off.

18:18.988 --> 18:20.660
I have no idea
what you just said.

18:20.785 --> 18:22.586
Your balls.

18:23.593 --> 18:26.699
He's gonna cut off
your balls.

18:36.106 --> 18:38.029
- Cut him, Diesel.
- He's mine.

18:38.308 --> 18:39.765
Come on, shorty!

18:40.576 --> 18:42.107
You messed up, bro.

18:42.612 --> 18:44.187
You're in
for a treat now, boy.

18:44.547 --> 18:45.970
Show him
what it's all about.

18:51.755 --> 18:52.563
Jesus!

19:08.972 --> 19:10.629
What the hell
you looking at?

19:10.664 --> 19:12.286
You're just
so damn beautiful.

19:12.776 --> 19:14.484
Especially
when you're angry.

19:18.752 --> 19:20.081
That's my bird.

20:16.306 --> 20:18.943
<i>He will defeat
an army of enemies</i>

20:19.086 --> 20:22.272
<i>while a flock of cranes
circles above.</i>

20:23.758 --> 20:25.547
Impossible.

20:26.182 --> 20:27.510
Besides...

20:28.145 --> 20:29.890
he's going to lose.

20:52.909 --> 20:54.510
Get up, boss! Get up!

21:02.942 --> 21:04.572
- Come on, Mr. F, take him!
- Get him!

21:04.607 --> 21:07.260
- Got him.
- Yeah, where you going now, baby?

21:08.179 --> 21:11.415
- Oh, he's kinda nice.
- Yeah, work it.

21:15.398 --> 21:16.352
Shit.

21:20.803 --> 21:22.824
Fancy shit now, huh?

21:22.939 --> 21:24.330
It is over.

21:25.605 --> 21:30.594
Hey, come on. I'm bored
with beating on this loser.

21:31.247 --> 21:35.040
Besides, fighting always
gets me hot.

21:41.784 --> 21:43.856
Lucky for you, this bit
of crumpet's come by begging

21:43.891 --> 21:45.597
for some of
my Funktastic love.

21:49.716 --> 21:52.025
Me or my people
ever see you boosting

21:52.060 --> 21:53.298
in our territory again,
mate...

21:53.505 --> 21:55.061
I'm gonna snip
your hampton clean off

21:55.096 --> 21:56.957
mince it and serve it
as a shishkebab.

21:57.815 --> 21:59.592
Now piss off.

22:34.978 --> 22:37.619
Congratulations
on your victory.

22:39.366 --> 22:42.627
Though, technically,
you were saved by a girl.

22:42.852 --> 22:44.009
It was your charm

22:44.044 --> 22:46.431
that convinced the girl
to lead them away.

22:46.655 --> 22:49.809
Hey, Mr. Do-gooder,
if you were watching

22:49.844 --> 22:52.241
the whole thing back there,
how come you didn't help me out?

22:52.276 --> 22:54.158
Because you stole from me.

22:54.967 --> 22:56.370
Oh, yeah. That.

22:56.833 --> 22:59.805
But your fighting
is very impressive.

22:59.840 --> 23:01.180
Where do you study?

23:02.197 --> 23:03.382
Golden Palace.

23:04.107 --> 23:05.449
Golden Palace?

23:07.543 --> 23:11.150
You studied with the venerable
fighting monks of Jin-Gong?

23:11.606 --> 23:13.167
Whatever, man.

23:13.247 --> 23:17.161
Look, it's been really great spending
more quality time with you, you know that,

23:17.196 --> 23:19.255
but I gotta run, okay?

23:19.769 --> 23:23.494
Sorry about stealing
your... whatever the hell that is.

23:23.771 --> 23:26.227
Good luck with
that enlightenment stuff.

23:27.196 --> 23:32.024
The most undisciplined youth
I have ever laid eyes on.

23:50.119 --> 23:52.018
- Not so fast.
- Not so fast?

23:52.180 --> 23:54.469
I've been trying to get down you
for a bloody long long time

23:54.504 --> 23:55.959
and every time
we're about to go all the way

23:55.994 --> 23:57.233
you up and run out on me.

23:57.369 --> 23:59.393
Nobody knows where you go,
what you do.

23:59.428 --> 24:01.165
No one knows anything
about you.

24:02.784 --> 24:05.016
You know
I'm worth waiting for.

24:25.922 --> 24:27.884
Sorry, baby.
You're on my list

24:27.919 --> 24:29.971
but you're not at the top.

24:30.203 --> 24:31.131
What?

24:34.297 --> 24:36.189
Piss off,
you little tart.

24:37.333 --> 24:38.702
I'm finished with you.

24:38.737 --> 24:40.989
Hey, girl.
Where's your necklace?

24:44.073 --> 24:45.077
Oh, shit.

25:00.160 --> 25:02.139
Relax, folks.
Enjoy the intermission.

25:02.174 --> 25:04.083
We have warm soda,
stale popcorn

25:04.118 --> 25:06.228
and dried seaweed snacks
at the concession.

25:06.263 --> 25:07.973
Hey, dickweed! Fix it!

25:08.475 --> 25:11.182
- I'm on it.
- You missed the reel change.

25:11.377 --> 25:13.187
Anybody asks for
their money back,

25:13.222 --> 25:14.642
I'm adding it to your rent.

25:14.677 --> 25:16.028
They already saw half of it.

25:16.063 --> 25:18.030
And I'm through
taking your messages!

25:18.065 --> 25:19.796
My name is Kojima,

25:20.263 --> 25:23.170
not Sony, Sanyo, Toshiba.

25:23.212 --> 25:24.387
Whoever heard
of a Japanese guy

25:24.422 --> 25:27.266
owning a Chinese
movie theater anyway?

25:27.301 --> 25:30.111
Ooohhh, I heard that,
you smart-ass!

25:31.787 --> 25:33.206
You have two choices, Kar...

25:33.564 --> 25:35.808
you can sit on your butt
and do nothing

25:35.843 --> 25:40.970
or fly like a phoenix from
the ashes of your pathetic life.

25:41.197 --> 25:43.258
I'm flying, I'm flying!

25:47.403 --> 25:48.686
People, relax.

25:49.381 --> 25:50.777
Come on,
projection boy!

25:50.812 --> 25:54.230
I'm tired of the white screen!
Give me some color here! Hey!

26:22.705 --> 26:26.488
So, this is the Golden Palace
where you learn how to fight.

26:28.358 --> 26:31.134
What... the hell
are you doing here?

26:31.169 --> 26:34.067
I should have known
from your sloppy technique.

26:38.087 --> 26:40.339
This is my place, okay?

26:40.923 --> 26:42.959
Get out... right now.

26:42.994 --> 26:45.953
An enlightened man would
offer a humble traveler

26:45.988 --> 26:47.514
shelter for the night,

26:47.608 --> 26:52.978
and share a quiet conversation
over a bowl of... Cocoa Puffs.

26:53.214 --> 26:54.320
Really?

26:55.104 --> 26:58.084
Well, I guess I ain't
that enlightened,

26:58.119 --> 27:01.700
cause I was thinking more...
of kicking your freaky ass

27:01.868 --> 27:04.299
back to wherever the hell
it comes from.

27:08.718 --> 27:13.402
For someone who says
he wants to kick my freaky ass,

27:14.330 --> 27:16.494
you do a lot of talking.

27:16.861 --> 27:20.010
Really? Well...

27:21.130 --> 27:23.107
I warned you,
old man.

27:25.466 --> 27:28.473
Oh. Got a little quickness
in you, don't you?

27:43.786 --> 27:46.389
Okay, fine.

27:46.826 --> 27:48.740
Guess I can't
make you get out.

27:56.466 --> 27:59.066
I overheard people
calling you... "Car".

28:00.403 --> 28:03.748
Spelled with a "K".
It's Cantonese.

28:03.819 --> 28:06.732
Funny,
you don't look Cantonese.

28:07.009 --> 28:09.120
It means "family", okay?

28:09.312 --> 28:10.787
I figure I never
had one growing up,

28:10.822 --> 28:13.734
but... from now on
I'll never be without.

28:15.484 --> 28:18.345
I'm afraid you are
mispronouncing your name, sir.

28:18.621 --> 28:21.117
It should sound
more like... "Ga".

28:21.924 --> 28:25.052
Look, it's my name, okay?

28:25.094 --> 28:26.997
I'll pronounce it
however I want.

28:27.923 --> 28:30.045
What about you?
What's your name?

28:31.219 --> 28:32.971
I don't have one.

28:34.526 --> 28:35.794
What do you mean?

28:36.072 --> 28:38.709
You gave yourself a name.
I gave mine up.

28:38.744 --> 28:40.176
Hey, what are you doing?

28:43.311 --> 28:44.989
Put that down.
Come on.

28:47.238 --> 28:50.058
All right. This is a Rolex.
You don't touch that.

28:50.093 --> 28:51.366
I know.

28:52.755 --> 28:53.542
So...

28:54.658 --> 28:57.451
why did you steal
the girl's necklace?

28:58.751 --> 29:00.043
I didn't steal it.

29:00.157 --> 29:02.948
I just, uh... I borrowed it.

29:04.647 --> 29:06.924
Look, I think she's into me.

29:06.959 --> 29:09.166
I mean,
I know she's into me.

29:09.201 --> 29:11.923
So, I'm going to return
her "lost" necklace,

29:11.958 --> 29:14.639
thereby making her
instantly indebted to me

29:14.674 --> 29:17.320
and placing me instantly
in her good graces.

29:17.646 --> 29:19.879
Deeply... in her good graces.

29:20.616 --> 29:22.432
It's foolproof.

29:24.353 --> 29:27.236
Except for one fool,
which will be you.

29:27.271 --> 29:32.282
If she realizes what you did,
your entire plan will backfire.

29:37.987 --> 29:42.724
Whoa-ho, whoa, whoa!
You're sleeping in my bed?

29:42.759 --> 29:45.453
It is quite comfortable,
thank you.

29:45.488 --> 29:47.201
You're absolutely crazy.

29:48.144 --> 29:51.841
You eat my food,
you sleep in my bed.

29:51.881 --> 29:53.413
That's great.

29:53.448 --> 29:56.356
You could at least tell me
why those guys were chasing you.

30:00.189 --> 30:00.995
All right.

30:02.925 --> 30:05.617
Let me put it in language
you will understand.

30:06.148 --> 30:07.267
Okay.

30:08.998 --> 30:12.464
Why do hot dogs
come in packages of ten,

30:12.499 --> 30:16.531
while hot dog buns
come in packages of just eight?

30:19.421 --> 30:21.404
What the hell is that?

30:21.430 --> 30:23.648
You can't answer my question
with another question,

30:23.929 --> 30:25.654
especially
one as stupid as that!

30:25.689 --> 30:28.442
When you attain
a state of enlightenment

30:28.477 --> 30:31.196
that allows you
to answer my question

30:32.154 --> 30:34.707
I'll answer yours.

30:34.894 --> 30:36.516
Good night.

30:36.959 --> 30:38.349
What?

31:50.964 --> 31:52.327
Ladies and gentlemen,

31:52.362 --> 31:54.802
as the newly-appointed
executive director

31:54.837 --> 31:56.394
of the Human Rights
Organization,

31:56.429 --> 31:58.749
I would like to welcome
you all here today.

31:59.312 --> 32:02.097
Now, please,
pardon our appearance.

32:02.132 --> 32:05.454
As you can see,
we're still under construction.

32:05.489 --> 32:08.776
But... we wanted you,
our most generous supporters

32:08.811 --> 32:11.363
to have a preview
of our new exhibit.

32:11.954 --> 32:14.392
You see, out of the rubble
that was Europe

32:14.427 --> 32:15.901
at the end of World War II,

32:15.936 --> 32:19.971
men and women of good will,
people like yourselves,

32:20.200 --> 32:22.683
decided to build
an organization dedicated

32:22.718 --> 32:25.166
to the prevention
of human rights abuses

32:25.201 --> 32:26.957
all around the Earth,

32:27.387 --> 32:29.853
and today
I am here to tell you...

32:29.972 --> 32:31.980
we failed.

32:32.940 --> 32:37.231
Thanks to... all of you
and many others like you,

32:37.266 --> 32:39.251
we are able
to continue this fight,

32:39.572 --> 32:42.489
this fight
against hate, violence,

32:42.524 --> 32:46.617
oppression, and cruelty
in all its forms.

32:51.076 --> 32:52.422
Excuse me.

32:52.761 --> 32:53.740
Yes.

32:53.851 --> 32:55.580
Do you ever worry
that some of the people

32:55.615 --> 32:58.023
that come here
may be inspired?

32:58.058 --> 33:00.989
Oh, I hope each and every person
that comes here will be inspired.

33:01.024 --> 33:03.622
I mean,
inspired to do it again.

33:03.860 --> 33:07.469
Oh... Well, granted, there are
an awful lot of sick people

33:07.504 --> 33:08.702
in this world,
but, thankfully,

33:08.737 --> 33:11.742
most of them don't attend
our functions.

33:12.081 --> 33:13.561
I have an idea.

33:15.517 --> 33:18.069
How about instead
of... showing atrocity,

33:18.897 --> 33:23.817
you do an exhibit that shows
man's... humanity... towards man?

33:23.937 --> 33:27.822
You don't help anyone
by shielding them from reality.

33:31.066 --> 33:34.420
Tell me...
Deep down inside...

33:34.682 --> 33:36.769
in the very bottom
of your soul...

33:37.273 --> 33:39.232
who would you choose to be?

33:40.811 --> 33:42.830
The one about to be shot?

33:46.582 --> 33:49.473
Or the one about to do
the shooting?

33:52.021 --> 33:55.695
I really must go.
It's been a pleasure.

34:17.446 --> 34:18.757
Oh, thank you.

34:18.793 --> 34:20.070
Thank you.

34:20.255 --> 34:21.915
What's going on?

34:22.130 --> 34:24.268
The event was
quite successful.

34:24.304 --> 34:26.407
That's not
what I'm talking about.

34:26.442 --> 34:28.431
Have you found it?

34:28.489 --> 34:30.228
Yes. Now, uh...

34:31.067 --> 34:33.399
unfortunately,
we also lost it.

34:36.231 --> 34:39.096
I'm surrounded
by weakness and failure.

34:39.130 --> 34:41.414
No. That was before.

34:41.630 --> 34:43.507
Now I'm here.

34:46.708 --> 34:50.399
You are surrounded by
respect, admiration...

34:51.914 --> 34:53.757
and love.

34:57.583 --> 35:00.415
We'll find the Scroll.
It's only a matter of time.

35:00.450 --> 35:05.787
Time... is the one thing
I'm running out of.

35:06.729 --> 35:10.860
For sixty years,
I have been chasing the Scroll.

35:11.100 --> 35:13.725
It holds the power
to rejuvenate me,

35:13.832 --> 35:15.372
to make me young again,

35:15.606 --> 35:20.027
and to finally cleanse the world
of all inferior races,

35:20.062 --> 35:24.448
as it should have been cleansed
all those years ago.

35:28.150 --> 35:29.602
That's the power.

35:30.452 --> 35:33.237
You let it slip
through your fingers, Nina.

35:33.989 --> 35:36.557
I have men combing the city
as we speak, Opa.

35:38.059 --> 35:39.888
Here you go.
All right, who's next?

35:39.923 --> 35:41.374
Plain with mustard,
please.

35:43.532 --> 35:44.983
Coming right up, ma'am.

35:46.101 --> 35:48.493
Hey! Watch it!

35:51.340 --> 35:53.434
Excuse me, sir!

35:55.077 --> 35:57.125
I believe you dropped this.

36:01.216 --> 36:02.381
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

36:02.416 --> 36:03.231
Thank you.

36:04.220 --> 36:05.791
What the hell was that?

36:05.904 --> 36:08.044
Sleight of hand.

36:08.812 --> 36:10.525
Man, I thought
I was through with you.

36:10.560 --> 36:12.753
Now you show up again
and you're picking my pocket?

36:12.980 --> 36:16.392
The pocket was yours,
but not what I picked.

36:16.541 --> 36:17.787
Don't you have
anything better to do

36:17.822 --> 36:20.785
than follow me around and screw up
my attempts to make a little extra cash?

36:20.820 --> 36:22.917
Here you go.
- Thanks, man.

36:25.486 --> 36:28.647
- Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Whoa, whoa.

36:29.311 --> 36:31.697
What, you-you got something
against hot dogs now?

36:31.732 --> 36:33.917
Cause, if I remember correctly,
last night

36:33.952 --> 36:36.717
you were using them to try
teach me ultimate enlightenment.

36:36.919 --> 36:39.589
I was translating
universal truth

36:39.624 --> 36:42.260
into words
you would understand.

36:42.891 --> 36:45.676
But this...
to keep the body pure,

36:45.711 --> 36:48.613
one must not kill
any living creature.

36:48.648 --> 36:51.516
I didn't kill it.
I'm gonna eat it.

36:52.381 --> 36:54.395
And by the way,
I got the answer

36:54.430 --> 36:56.376
to your little question
from last night.

36:56.411 --> 36:57.952
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Check this out.

36:58.751 --> 37:01.367
The reason hot dogs
come in packages of ten

37:01.678 --> 37:03.856
and hot dog buns come
in packages of just eight

37:03.891 --> 37:06.577
is that you always need
more buns for your hot dogs.

37:06.612 --> 37:09.659
So, no matter how much you get,
how much you win, or how much you achieve,

37:10.387 --> 37:13.614
you can never, ever let yourself
feel like it's enough.

37:16.501 --> 37:19.354
No, but good try.

37:20.529 --> 37:23.667
For a guy I barely know,
you're really starting to annoy me.

37:23.854 --> 37:27.512
Knowing others
means you are wise,

37:28.524 --> 37:31.524
but knowing yourself
means you are enlightened.

37:31.524 --> 37:34.742
Enough with all this
fortune cookie philosophy, okay?

37:35.577 --> 37:37.013
<i>Target in sight.</i>

37:38.144 --> 37:39.288
<i>Hold your position.</i>

37:39.452 --> 37:41.066
This is America.

37:41.066 --> 37:42.556
We don't have
enlightenment here.

37:42.556 --> 37:46.027
We have... Big Macs, strip clubs...

37:46.027 --> 37:49.189
shopping malls,
Las Vegas, and HBO!

37:49.425 --> 37:50.621
Got it?

37:52.394 --> 37:54.833
Hey, you! Kar!

38:08.017 --> 38:12.314
He-hey! You don't quite look like
the bad girl you did last night.

38:12.314 --> 38:13.690
My necklace.

38:15.183 --> 38:16.040
Excuse me?

38:16.040 --> 38:18.237
Last night
I lost my necklace.

38:18.331 --> 38:20.011
Something tells me
you may have an idea

38:20.011 --> 38:21.793
of how I can get it back.

38:26.161 --> 38:29.156
Well, I guess I could keep
my eyes and my ears open.

38:29.598 --> 38:31.346
What's in it for me?

38:31.381 --> 38:35.282
It belonged to my mom.
It's important to me.

38:35.625 --> 38:38.240
I guess...
I'd owe you one.

38:39.174 --> 38:40.323
Who's your friend?

38:42.611 --> 38:43.680
Him?

38:44.813 --> 38:48.912
Ah, he's my personal bodyguard.
Watches my back.

38:49.584 --> 38:51.882
He's an incredibly deadly
Shaolin monk.

38:51.920 --> 38:53.826
Ten fingers, ten toes....

38:54.323 --> 38:56.287
Twenty reasons to die.

38:57.020 --> 38:59.590
Shaolin monks shave
their heads every day.

39:02.576 --> 39:04.839
You're no Shaolin monk.

39:05.801 --> 39:07.887
Tibetan... Buddhist, maybe?

39:07.887 --> 39:10.609
This young lady
is nobody's fool.

39:34.529 --> 39:36.660
Yeah, tell me about it.

39:40.202 --> 39:42.469
You know, last night
was the first time

39:42.469 --> 39:45.432
that I've ever seen anybody
stand up to Funktastic.

39:46.008 --> 39:48.039
Incredibly brave and...

39:48.436 --> 39:50.977
incredibly stupid
at the same time.

39:52.681 --> 39:54.572
Interesting mix.

39:57.252 --> 39:58.905
I'm sorry.
I have to go.

40:00.756 --> 40:02.116
Where are you going?

40:26.014 --> 40:26.764
Over there!

40:27.215 --> 40:29.419
There they are!
Come on!

40:29.694 --> 40:32.243
Sorry, man!
This is your fight, not mine!

40:32.287 --> 40:33.299
Good luck!

40:37.592 --> 40:38.615
Oh, shit!

40:51.628 --> 40:52.887
Come on! Come on!

40:55.243 --> 40:56.314
Thought about it,
man!

40:56.394 --> 40:58.290
Couldn't just leave you
hanging like that!

40:58.290 --> 40:59.544
Watch out!

41:16.765 --> 41:17.990
Man down!

41:30.245 --> 41:31.918
Kar, let's go!

41:35.016 --> 41:36.169
This way!

41:36.618 --> 41:38.361
These guys
don't give up easy!

41:38.521 --> 41:40.805
They haven't for sixty years!

41:45.794 --> 41:46.445
Hold up!

41:56.114 --> 41:57.649
Inside! Quick!

42:18.407 --> 42:19.566
<i>Where'd he go?</i>

42:19.633 --> 42:20.367
<i>I don't know.</i>

42:20.913 --> 42:23.262
Out the back!
They went out the back!

42:40.948 --> 42:43.023
Wow, you're really popular.

42:48.765 --> 42:50.163
Brother Tenzin.

42:50.821 --> 42:52.133
Brother.

42:53.061 --> 42:54.874
Allow me to offer you
a place to freshen up

42:55.103 --> 42:58.180
and a cup of
our finest butter tea.

42:58.833 --> 42:59.789
Please.

43:04.071 --> 43:07.195
Hey, can I have some tea?
I'm thirsty, man.

43:10.512 --> 43:12.559
Been doing
a lot of running lately.

43:14.015 --> 43:15.967
Something I said?

43:20.729 --> 43:22.281
What's up, man?

43:23.024 --> 43:23.567
That's how we do it.

43:23.567 --> 43:26.073
There you go.
That's where you let go.

43:28.530 --> 43:30.034
Really?

43:32.467 --> 43:35.529
Tell me, brother,
who is the young man?

43:35.870 --> 43:37.723
He's a thief.

43:38.287 --> 43:40.499
You got one hell
of a handshake.

43:41.776 --> 43:45.984
Unfortunately,
it's not strong enough.

43:51.108 --> 43:54.079
A thief?
And you bring him here?

43:54.079 --> 43:57.295
Water which is too pure
has no fish.

43:57.330 --> 43:59.387
Yes, I see.

43:59.728 --> 44:01.467
My uncle told me
what happened

44:01.467 --> 44:03.952
in the Temple of Sublime Truth
sixty years ago,

44:03.952 --> 44:06.233
when you became The Next
and protected him.

44:06.233 --> 44:07.618
He was just a child...

44:07.793 --> 44:10.516
but he never forgot
what he saw that day...

44:11.139 --> 44:13.281
the wonders of the Scroll.

44:14.552 --> 44:18.574
For sixty years,
we have been preparing.

44:19.247 --> 44:21.409
Now the Year of the Ram
is once again upon us

44:21.409 --> 44:23.457
and we have a number
of very apt pupils

44:23.457 --> 44:24.757
right here
in our humble temple,

44:26.179 --> 44:29.819
and one very strong candidate.

44:31.259 --> 44:32.814
Not bad.

44:34.497 --> 44:36.498
I'm not even trying.

44:38.233 --> 44:41.312
You thought you were gonna win,
but you're not.

44:42.771 --> 44:45.820
- You think so?
- I know so.

44:46.846 --> 44:49.450
It is not a matter
of study alone.

44:49.632 --> 44:51.741
There are the Prophecies.

44:51.741 --> 44:54.749
Surely you agree, brother,
the Prophecies do not apply

44:54.749 --> 44:57.525
to such a common thief,
a pickpocket.

44:57.525 --> 45:01.258
The Prophecies
must apply to everyone

45:02.290 --> 45:04.190
or they mean nothing.

45:04.225 --> 45:05.676
Of course.

45:13.301 --> 45:15.599
- You let go first.
- No way.

45:20.322 --> 45:23.737
Hey... Just playing around.

45:23.867 --> 45:25.281
Next time, brother.

45:25.461 --> 45:28.023
Yeah, next time.

45:32.187 --> 45:33.811
You helped me
get away from those men.

45:33.811 --> 45:35.844
Maybe there is some help
I can give you...

45:37.971 --> 45:40.001
with your fighting.

45:40.468 --> 45:42.334
Let's do it.

45:45.867 --> 45:47.465
Here, here.

45:49.270 --> 45:50.935
Special medicine.

45:55.838 --> 45:59.043
Hey. That's cool.
It's comfy.

45:59.214 --> 46:00.763
It's fast-acting.

46:00.763 --> 46:02.383
This stuff is great.
What is it?

46:02.568 --> 46:05.941
Homemade...
from my own urine.

46:10.807 --> 46:13.143
That's disgusting.

46:13.561 --> 46:15.442
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

46:15.442 --> 46:17.303
I'm looking for someone.
His name is Kar.

46:17.303 --> 46:19.682
I asked around,
and I heard that he works here.

46:19.682 --> 46:22.776
What's a pretty girl like you
want to see him for?

46:22.776 --> 46:24.533
I think that
he may be in trouble.

46:24.704 --> 46:27.815
Damn right he is in trouble.
Half the day has gone by

46:27.815 --> 46:30.761
and he still hasn't got back
with tonight's movie.

46:30.761 --> 46:32.954
So you're saying
you haven't seen him all day?

46:32.954 --> 46:36.948
Don't worry.
Kar can take care of himself.

46:37.318 --> 46:40.687
That's part of why
I trust him to help me.

46:41.302 --> 46:42.920
What's the other part?

46:42.920 --> 46:45.919
I just don't know why,
but I keep thinking...

46:46.334 --> 46:49.201
that kid's got potential.

46:50.393 --> 46:52.277
So they tell me.

47:02.110 --> 47:03.941
Will you make sure
that he gets this?

47:03.978 --> 47:05.483
What am I, a secretary?

47:05.483 --> 47:07.036
Please.

47:11.535 --> 47:13.692
You're welcome!

47:24.165 --> 47:26.340
"Bad Girl"?

47:28.369 --> 47:30.695
You must learn
the unity of opposites.

47:30.839 --> 47:32.920
Be mobile
and stationary,

47:33.208 --> 47:35.981
defensive
and offensive.

47:54.524 --> 47:57.845
You attack with
all the wrong weapons, Kar.

48:10.745 --> 48:12.114
It is not about anger.

48:12.114 --> 48:14.367
It's about peace.

48:24.058 --> 48:25.323
It's not about power.

48:26.060 --> 48:27.796
It's about grace.

48:39.240 --> 48:41.241
It's not about
knowing your enemy.

48:41.776 --> 48:44.417
It's all about
knowing yourself.

49:06.668 --> 49:07.943
How'd you do that?

49:07.943 --> 49:09.138
The air...

49:09.138 --> 49:12.171
you can't see it,
but it fills your lungs.

49:15.777 --> 49:17.433
It's as real as blood

49:17.506 --> 49:19.819
or flesh, or bone,

49:19.819 --> 49:22.278
or earth, or water.

49:22.317 --> 49:24.646
Once you realize this...

49:24.786 --> 49:26.599
you treat the air
the same way.

49:26.599 --> 49:29.781
You step on it
as you would a stone.

49:29.781 --> 49:32.962
You swim through it,
as you would the sea.

49:33.190 --> 49:36.107
And all you have to do
is believe.

49:36.107 --> 49:37.658
Believe what?

49:38.132 --> 49:41.077
The laws of gravity
don't exist?

49:43.104 --> 49:45.402
If you truly believe
that they don't,

49:45.402 --> 49:47.406
then they don't.

49:54.887 --> 49:56.246
Get down!

50:31.444 --> 50:33.620
Hold the Scroll.
Don't lose it.

50:42.832 --> 50:44.039
Right there!

50:53.908 --> 50:54.881
Stay here.

51:14.783 --> 51:17.149
<i>This is Air Team.
Target is on the roof.</i>

52:23.397 --> 52:24.121
Oh, no.

52:54.723 --> 52:58.435
Oh, shit!

53:19.751 --> 53:22.215
<i>I'm hit!
I'm pulling out!</i>

53:35.369 --> 53:37.194
Come on! Come on!

53:37.255 --> 53:38.606
No!

53:54.311 --> 53:55.520
Help!

54:03.722 --> 54:05.025
Are you okay?

54:06.220 --> 54:09.377
Look, I'm sorry
about the Scroll.

54:09.377 --> 54:10.589
And thanks
for saving my life...

54:11.452 --> 54:14.066
I just came this close
to being killed.

54:14.381 --> 54:17.234
I'm a pickpocket,
not a hero.

54:17.234 --> 54:18.975
I'm outta here.

54:25.686 --> 54:28.091
Don't you want
to know the truth?

54:29.099 --> 54:31.549
Well, it's about time
you came clean.

54:37.429 --> 54:39.524
- Golden Palace Theater.
- Very good.

54:40.866 --> 54:42.946
Who are these guys
after the Scroll?

54:42.981 --> 54:45.616
Mercenaries led by a Nazi.

54:45.616 --> 54:48.401
A hungry ghost
obsessed with the past.

54:52.377 --> 54:54.881
You speak like you were born
in the Punjab, my friend.

54:55.170 --> 54:57.339
In fact, I would say
you were a follower

54:57.339 --> 54:59.026
of the Guru's path
yourself, but, uh...

54:59.026 --> 55:01.158
I know.
Not enough hair.

55:01.586 --> 55:02.512
You like this music?

55:03.345 --> 55:04.079
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

55:04.079 --> 55:06.224
It's the bomb-diggity.

55:07.793 --> 55:09.752
Excuse me. I have to talk
to my baby mama-to-be.

55:09.752 --> 55:10.892
Go ahead.

55:12.124 --> 55:13.713
In Kashmir, I studied

55:13.713 --> 55:16.051
the enlightened teachings
of the Gurus

55:16.051 --> 55:18.015
until Struker found me again.

55:18.015 --> 55:20.439
Struker?
He's the leader?

55:20.439 --> 55:23.713
His dream is to remake the world
in his own image.

55:23.713 --> 55:28.379
Every race, creed, color
he deems inferior... destroyed.

55:28.488 --> 55:30.082
Total genocide.

55:30.215 --> 55:32.915
If all this insanity
is even remotely true,

55:33.182 --> 55:35.383
you should've let me die
and save the Scroll.

55:35.383 --> 55:37.537
I place great value
on your life

55:37.558 --> 55:41.415
but not as much as I place
on the life of the world.

55:47.566 --> 55:48.886
Well?

55:59.474 --> 56:02.738
It's a recipe
for noodle soup.

56:05.902 --> 56:07.456
Noodle soup?

56:15.694 --> 56:17.326
You may be
my granddaughter,

56:18.163 --> 56:21.496
but that will only
protect you for so long.

56:22.834 --> 56:24.456
Then where's the Scroll?

56:24.536 --> 56:26.969
On my body. In my soul.

56:27.031 --> 56:28.946
I've been running
for a long time.

56:28.946 --> 56:30.672
Too many close calls.

56:30.672 --> 56:33.000
The Scroll needed
to be someplace safe.

56:33.000 --> 56:35.693
So, you've been protecting
the Scroll for, like, 60 years?

56:37.249 --> 56:40.207
Look at you.
You haven't aged one bit.

56:41.104 --> 56:43.879
Whoever is entrusted
with the Scroll

56:43.879 --> 56:46.254
gains the trust of time.

56:46.291 --> 56:48.513
If you become ill,
you will recover.

56:48.513 --> 56:50.723
If injured,
you will heal.

56:50.723 --> 56:54.053
He who protects the Scroll
is protected by it.

57:05.811 --> 57:07.452
Hello there.

57:07.583 --> 57:09.980
Sorry, but the show's
been delayed.

57:10.015 --> 57:12.931
Can I offer you popcorn?
On the house.

57:12.959 --> 57:16.054
No, thanks.
Health Department.

57:16.683 --> 57:18.834
I got an "A", see?

57:19.404 --> 57:21.368
You have a young man
working for you.

57:21.368 --> 57:24.084
He lives here. Well,
that's a serious violation

57:24.084 --> 57:25.984
of health and safety codes.

57:26.171 --> 57:28.340
I don't know
what you're talking about.

57:30.807 --> 57:32.836
Does that jog your memory?

57:35.907 --> 57:38.705
I'm calling the cops,
you crazy bitch.

57:41.899 --> 57:43.393
No, I'm not crazy.

57:43.915 --> 57:45.589
But I am a bitch.

57:45.717 --> 57:48.503
Man, if I knew I was gonna pay,
I wouldn't have cabbed it.

57:51.423 --> 57:53.576
Yo, Mr. Kojima.

57:55.393 --> 57:56.981
My boss doesn't seem
to be here

57:56.981 --> 57:59.526
which means you don't get
to watch me get yelled at.

58:05.146 --> 58:06.775
"Bad Girl."

58:26.258 --> 58:27.659
Mr. Kojima!

58:41.728 --> 58:44.337
Kar, over here.

59:08.133 --> 59:10.156
I'm sorry, Kar.

59:11.336 --> 59:13.709
I should have never
gotten you involved.

59:14.009 --> 59:16.080
I just...
- You just what?

59:16.377 --> 59:19.896
I had a crazy notion that maybe
you could fulfill a prophecy

59:19.896 --> 59:23.990
once told to me by
another old man before he died.

59:26.952 --> 59:28.674
They are never
going to stop

59:28.737 --> 59:31.754
until they get me
and the Scroll.

59:35.123 --> 59:38.961
Go someplace safe
and forget about all of this.

59:42.500 --> 59:44.441
Goodbye, Kar.

01:00:23.177 --> 01:00:24.848
Time to fly.

01:00:36.221 --> 01:00:37.513
Monk!

01:00:45.919 --> 01:00:47.853
Monk!

01:01:05.509 --> 01:01:06.941
Shit.

01:01:08.653 --> 01:01:10.114
Open up!

01:01:13.058 --> 01:01:14.596
Somebody!

01:01:17.395 --> 01:01:18.697
Excuse me.
- Go away.

01:01:18.789 --> 01:01:20.706
Look, I'm sorry
if I woke you, but...

01:01:21.549 --> 01:01:24.020
Do you remember me
from before?

01:01:25.203 --> 01:01:26.831
I was with the monk.

01:01:27.043 --> 01:01:28.138
Look...

01:01:30.141 --> 01:01:31.154
Look, I have to find him.

01:01:31.154 --> 01:01:33.269
- No, not here.
- No!

01:01:34.646 --> 01:01:35.308
Stop.

01:01:38.783 --> 01:01:40.181
He is a friend.

01:02:33.037 --> 01:02:33.748
Hi.

01:02:37.675 --> 01:02:39.247
Listen to me, man.

01:02:41.904 --> 01:02:43.957
You can't do this alone.

01:02:44.382 --> 01:02:49.046
I carry the responsibility
of the Scroll on my shoulders.

01:02:49.046 --> 01:02:50.969
No one else's.

01:02:52.791 --> 01:02:56.332
If I have to carry it
another sixty years, I will.

01:02:58.229 --> 01:03:00.224
I'll be safe here
till the morning.

01:03:00.224 --> 01:03:01.940
But then I'm leaving.

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:03.802
What about me?

01:03:03.802 --> 01:03:08.018
I'm sorry, Kar, but this way
is better for both of us.

01:03:08.706 --> 01:03:09.592
No!

01:03:10.041 --> 01:03:12.011
You can't abandon me
like this.

01:03:12.346 --> 01:03:14.871
Not after everything
you just put me through.

01:03:18.401 --> 01:03:20.788
Cause now I got nothing.

01:03:28.295 --> 01:03:29.912
They're here.

01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:50.327
- My brothers!
- You have to escape.

01:03:50.327 --> 01:03:51.528
Escape to where?

01:03:55.449 --> 01:03:57.398
- Where is he?
- Downstairs.

01:03:57.398 --> 01:03:58.652
Stop! No!

01:04:08.823 --> 01:04:09.582
Why?

01:04:09.582 --> 01:04:11.215
I don't want
to protect the Scroll.

01:04:11.215 --> 01:04:14.060
I want to read it.
Take the power.

01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:17.088
Even if I have
to share it.

01:04:26.518 --> 01:04:28.245
Is this your idea
of a joke?

01:04:41.966 --> 01:04:44.818
Trust me.
I'll get us out of the city.

01:04:48.306 --> 01:04:49.959
My brother monks...

01:04:50.171 --> 01:04:54.239
when I finally get my hands
on your brother with no name,

01:04:54.239 --> 01:04:56.649
he will, of course,
resist my efforts

01:04:56.649 --> 01:04:59.890
to secure the location
of the Scroll.

01:04:59.951 --> 01:05:01.808
But with this machine...

01:05:01.886 --> 01:05:05.940
I'll torture the information
I need out of him.

01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:09.960
And now for...
a little test.

01:05:10.962 --> 01:05:12.070
What?

01:05:13.174 --> 01:05:16.178
No! Let me go!
What are you doing?

01:05:16.434 --> 01:05:17.604
We had a deal!

01:05:17.735 --> 01:05:19.395
Did you really think...

01:05:19.629 --> 01:05:23.251
I was going to share
ultimate power with you?

01:05:32.383 --> 01:05:34.348
Engage hydro system.

01:05:35.286 --> 01:05:37.313
Hydro systems engaged!

01:05:50.873 --> 01:05:55.080
Too bad you have
no useful information for me.

01:06:01.030 --> 01:06:03.091
Now find me the monk.

01:06:11.089 --> 01:06:12.834
Skipper's cool.

01:06:12.869 --> 01:06:14.795
He's gonna take us
right where we wanna go.

01:06:19.697 --> 01:06:21.041
You all right, man?

01:06:21.099 --> 01:06:22.589
Yeah.

01:06:25.621 --> 01:06:28.553
You led me to the path
I should have chosen.

01:06:29.374 --> 01:06:31.161
Thank you, Kar.

01:06:33.134 --> 01:06:35.278
Isn't it customary
to call a girl

01:06:35.278 --> 01:06:37.756
before you show up
at her house?

01:06:37.989 --> 01:06:41.018
Yeah. I figured it's in
the middle of the night.

01:06:42.141 --> 01:06:44.538
If I call her up, she might say
"No way in hell."

01:06:44.538 --> 01:06:46.294
But if I show up
in person...

01:06:46.695 --> 01:06:49.516
she's not gonna say "no"
to my charming face.

01:06:51.896 --> 01:06:53.203
You know what, man?

01:06:53.203 --> 01:06:56.555
I'm not taking advice
about women from a monk.

01:06:59.370 --> 01:07:03.807
I wasn't born a monk.
Nobody is.

01:07:18.389 --> 01:07:20.777
Hiding here for the night?
Bad idea.

01:07:20.777 --> 01:07:22.959
You must
trust your instincts.

01:07:23.207 --> 01:07:27.006
Where could we be safer than
in a house surrounded by guards?

01:07:27.698 --> 01:07:29.442
So, how do we
get in, genius?

01:07:29.442 --> 01:07:32.430
Why ask me?
You are the thief.

01:07:35.307 --> 01:07:38.547
Okay. The two principles
of every rip-off

01:07:38.547 --> 01:07:40.141
are misdirection
and speed.

01:07:40.141 --> 01:07:41.435
Misdirection.

01:07:54.726 --> 01:07:56.256
And speed.

01:08:14.212 --> 01:08:16.077
Coast is clear.
Let's go.

01:08:23.187 --> 01:08:24.376
All right.

01:08:35.233 --> 01:08:36.580
How 'bout a boost?

01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:39.042
How about you do this one
on your own?

01:08:41.238 --> 01:08:42.724
Okay.

01:08:56.323 --> 01:08:58.225
- You're okay?
- Just checking the distance.

01:08:58.225 --> 01:08:59.200
- I know.
- It's good.

01:08:59.200 --> 01:08:59.844
Hurry up.

01:08:59.844 --> 01:09:02.866
- Sure you don't wanna do it?
- No, I'm fine.

01:09:03.533 --> 01:09:05.042
Okay.

01:09:07.645 --> 01:09:08.988
You're good.

01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:11.037
Check this out.

01:09:14.796 --> 01:09:16.051
Oh, shit!

01:09:25.082 --> 01:09:26.685
Don't say anything.

01:09:27.484 --> 01:09:29.941
You feel a little bit dizzy?
Do you?

01:09:29.953 --> 01:09:32.593
- I'm okay.
- Good.

01:09:32.657 --> 01:09:34.404
You're enjoying this,
aren't you?

01:09:34.692 --> 01:09:37.107
Very much, yeah.
Do it.

01:09:38.654 --> 01:09:40.100
Okay. Forget everything
you've ever learned

01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:41.978
about how
the universe operates.

01:09:43.167 --> 01:09:45.247
I can step on the air
like a stone...

01:09:45.955 --> 01:09:48.197
swim through it
like the sea.

01:09:48.968 --> 01:09:51.587
All I gotta do is believe.

01:10:07.643 --> 01:10:09.089
Not bad.

01:10:26.811 --> 01:10:29.179
Well, well, well,
what do we have here?

01:10:30.162 --> 01:10:34.441
Lover of weird insects
and deadly reptiles.

01:11:05.116 --> 01:11:08.102
Hey... Bad Girl.

01:11:08.719 --> 01:11:09.676
Oh, jeez!

01:11:12.739 --> 01:11:15.113
Kar, what the hell
are you doing here?

01:11:17.261 --> 01:11:17.912
Lose this?

01:11:18.729 --> 01:11:20.778
I didn't lose it.
You stole it.

01:11:21.881 --> 01:11:23.450
That's not true.

01:11:24.062 --> 01:11:25.416
You're a liar.

01:11:27.033 --> 01:11:30.034
Come on, you're a pickpocket.
You expect me to believe that?

01:11:30.034 --> 01:11:33.017
Yeah. I'm a nice guy.
I wouldn't steal from you.

01:11:33.694 --> 01:11:35.604
You can't lie for shit.

01:11:37.048 --> 01:11:38.790
I'm a terrific liar.

01:11:39.969 --> 01:11:42.284
Okay. I did take it...

01:11:42.414 --> 01:11:46.790
but, uh, I was just... I was borrowing it
so I could give it back.

01:11:46.881 --> 01:11:49.197
Look, it was
a stupid thing to do, okay?

01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:51.386
Sometimes I can be kind of...
- An asshole!

01:11:52.797 --> 01:11:54.240
Yeah, I may have lied to you
about the necklace

01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:56.533
but I never lied to you
about who I am.

01:11:57.381 --> 01:11:58.669
You're saying that I did?

01:11:58.669 --> 01:12:00.964
Yeah. Look at this place.

01:12:01.238 --> 01:12:02.616
I thought you were
from the streets like me,

01:12:02.616 --> 01:12:05.422
but... it turns out you're
some spoiled little rich girl.

01:12:05.422 --> 01:12:07.186
You don't know
a damn thing about it.

01:12:07.186 --> 01:12:08.454
I think I do.

01:12:16.522 --> 01:12:18.124
You kinda liked that,
didn't you?

01:12:20.157 --> 01:12:21.390
Is this what you want?

01:12:27.898 --> 01:12:29.264
Why are you really here?

01:12:29.264 --> 01:12:32.066
I came here because
I thought I could trust you.

01:12:32.211 --> 01:12:34.726
That monk... has got
these mystical words

01:12:34.726 --> 01:12:36.210
tattooed on his body...

01:12:36.674 --> 01:12:38.928
that some psycho
from World War II needs

01:12:38.928 --> 01:12:41.510
in order to take over
the whole goddamn world.

01:12:44.255 --> 01:12:45.701
You're crazy!

01:12:48.109 --> 01:12:51.104
Kar. Kar,
are you okay?

01:12:52.559 --> 01:12:54.132
He'll be fine.

01:12:54.458 --> 01:12:55.639
What are you doing here?

01:12:55.639 --> 01:12:57.985
That is not a question
you need to ask.

01:12:57.985 --> 01:13:00.139
Instead, you should be
asking yourself

01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:03.924
why you run away from
this palace every night...

01:13:04.535 --> 01:13:06.268
then race back to it
each morning.

01:13:06.268 --> 01:13:07.949
With all due respect...

01:13:08.667 --> 01:13:11.308
please don't tell me
how to live my life, okay?

01:13:11.396 --> 01:13:13.967
I'm not telling you
how to live your life.

01:13:14.178 --> 01:13:16.618
I'm only suggesting
you would be happier

01:13:16.618 --> 01:13:18.798
living one complete life...

01:13:18.798 --> 01:13:21.674
instead of two lives
that are incomplete.

01:13:24.380 --> 01:13:25.408
Kar...

01:13:28.213 --> 01:13:31.516
Hey. You were right. I think
I should have called first.

01:13:32.530 --> 01:13:33.811
I'm sorry.

01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:37.184
My life's... complicated.

01:13:37.835 --> 01:13:40.909
My dad's Ivan Kerensky.

01:13:41.439 --> 01:13:42.284
What?

01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:46.049
Ivan the Terrible?

01:13:50.714 --> 01:13:53.785
You're a Russian Mafia princess?
That's perfect.

01:13:53.785 --> 01:13:55.425
My name is Jade...

01:13:56.112 --> 01:13:59.341
and my dad is serving
twenty years in federal prison.

01:13:59.564 --> 01:14:01.328
So maybe now
you understand why

01:14:01.328 --> 01:14:03.623
we keep everything
about myself secret.

01:14:03.924 --> 01:14:08.688
Because the street is the one place
where I can earn my own respect.

01:14:15.539 --> 01:14:18.759
"He will battle for love
in the palace of jade."

01:14:20.945 --> 01:14:22.881
Two out of three.

01:14:23.581 --> 01:14:25.724
Two out of three what?

01:14:28.619 --> 01:14:30.647
Prophecies.

01:14:35.254 --> 01:14:36.238
Look out!

01:15:02.796 --> 01:15:04.268
Clever.

01:15:06.657 --> 01:15:10.269
Careful with that body of his.
It's priceless.

01:15:25.509 --> 01:15:28.092
They must have found your address
when they killed Kojima.

01:15:28.193 --> 01:15:29.823
We need to get moving.

01:15:30.648 --> 01:15:31.812
Where the hell
are we supposed to go?

01:15:31.812 --> 01:15:33.982
The Human Rights Organization
downtown.

01:15:34.418 --> 01:15:35.633
That's crazy.

01:15:35.633 --> 01:15:38.508
That bitch,
who just wrecked my house,

01:15:39.557 --> 01:15:41.311
she's the executive
director there.

01:15:41.311 --> 01:15:43.880
I was there this morning
for an exhibit opening.

01:15:46.497 --> 01:15:48.893
My dad always told me
that the best place to hide

01:15:48.893 --> 01:15:51.086
is the last place
they would expect.

01:15:51.086 --> 01:15:52.786
And the Human Rights
Organization

01:15:52.786 --> 01:15:55.825
is the last place anyone
would ever expect to find

01:15:55.825 --> 01:15:58.932
some of the biggest
human rights abusers in history.

01:16:02.479 --> 01:16:06.352
Thanks.
I gotta do this on my own.

01:16:06.387 --> 01:16:08.464
Monk's the only family I got.

01:16:11.989 --> 01:16:13.934
I can help.

01:16:14.409 --> 01:16:17.816
How do you like
my armor-plated car... Kar?

01:16:19.496 --> 01:16:20.413
We can use the subway

01:16:20.413 --> 01:16:21.943
to reach the old water main,
which will get us

01:16:21.943 --> 01:16:24.011
into the Human Rights
building from below.

01:16:25.298 --> 01:16:27.731
Jeez! That's a nice
collection of toys

01:16:27.731 --> 01:16:29.929
your father
keeps in the garage.

01:16:33.010 --> 01:16:35.168
Who said
these were my dad's?

01:16:37.628 --> 01:16:38.705
My grandfather
used to tell me

01:16:38.705 --> 01:16:41.102
stories about you
when I was a little girl.

01:16:41.352 --> 01:16:42.321
I used to think
you were a myth,

01:16:42.321 --> 01:16:44.725
something he made up
to lull me to sleep at night

01:16:44.725 --> 01:16:46.466
and then one day...

01:16:48.586 --> 01:16:50.616
he showed me these.

01:16:53.031 --> 01:16:56.841
Ever wonder how he kept
finding you all through these years?

01:16:59.370 --> 01:17:02.109
Oh, my name's Nina,
by the way.

01:17:02.673 --> 01:17:04.995
You don't have a name,
do you?

01:17:05.509 --> 01:17:07.976
That's, uh, kind of sexy.

01:17:12.682 --> 01:17:16.261
How far down do
these tattoos go, I wonder?

01:17:22.126 --> 01:17:23.317
That far.

01:17:23.394 --> 01:17:25.005
Well, I guess
I'll have to scan it all...

01:17:25.863 --> 01:17:28.591
every inch. Oh, well.

01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:34.196
Big job.
Someone's got to do it.

01:17:48.118 --> 01:17:48.917
You know...

01:17:49.283 --> 01:17:52.008
we might not make it
out of this thing alive.

01:17:52.589 --> 01:17:53.938
Out of my car?

01:17:56.193 --> 01:17:59.988
You got a lot of guts for coming
with me on this insane ride.

01:18:00.497 --> 01:18:02.797
Guts and insanity.

01:18:03.131 --> 01:18:04.657
Interesting mix.

01:18:04.657 --> 01:18:06.726
Not making it out
of this thing alive...

01:18:07.471 --> 01:18:09.360
that would really suck.

01:18:10.307 --> 01:18:12.786
Under the circumstances.

01:18:13.195 --> 01:18:14.376
Yeah.

01:18:15.813 --> 01:18:17.641
Definitely.

01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:39.767
Look at me... monk.

01:18:42.404 --> 01:18:46.617
For you,
the years were nothing...

01:18:47.606 --> 01:18:51.205
but I withered
and grew old.

01:18:54.618 --> 01:18:57.861
But all that is about
to change. Nina!

01:19:21.979 --> 01:19:23.636
Find out
what's going on, Nina!

01:19:24.211 --> 01:19:25.389
Now!

01:20:22.706 --> 01:20:24.634
You two, to the right.

01:20:32.382 --> 01:20:33.928
Don't move!

01:20:35.652 --> 01:20:36.888
Guys...

01:20:37.621 --> 01:20:41.539
it's not about anger.
It's about peace.

01:20:54.204 --> 01:20:56.311
You do have potential.

01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:05.869
The monk is down here.
I can feel it.

01:21:54.492 --> 01:21:57.764
And now,
the last verse.

01:22:09.656 --> 01:22:10.533
Where...

01:22:11.740 --> 01:22:13.516
where's the rest of it?

01:22:18.956 --> 01:22:21.079
Where's the last verse
of the Scroll?

01:22:21.258 --> 01:22:22.915
Where is it?

01:22:23.715 --> 01:22:25.681
I memorized it.

01:22:27.064 --> 01:22:31.329
Just in case someone like you
managed to get this far.

01:22:42.070 --> 01:22:43.629
Fine.

01:23:02.199 --> 01:23:05.116
Oh, shit.
We gotta move!

01:23:12.409 --> 01:23:13.842
Get up!

01:23:14.987 --> 01:23:16.175
Come on!

01:23:37.749 --> 01:23:39.503
Hello, my dear.

01:23:42.845 --> 01:23:45.692
Fancy meeting you here.

01:24:48.205 --> 01:24:51.470
Now you will tell me
what I want to know.

01:25:26.977 --> 01:25:30.739
This is getting
very annoying.

01:26:34.477 --> 01:26:36.408
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

01:26:36.408 --> 01:26:38.238
Let's go back there
and finish him off.

01:26:39.850 --> 01:26:42.000
I'll fight him myself.

01:26:42.485 --> 01:26:43.800
You're not ready.

01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:47.388
Oh, really?
I rescued you, didn't I?

01:27:02.973 --> 01:27:05.713
- Kar, stay back!
- No way.

01:27:19.411 --> 01:27:20.401
Kar!

01:28:36.700 --> 01:28:38.155
My God.

01:29:16.473 --> 01:29:17.177
The last verse...

01:29:17.904 --> 01:29:19.540
or I destroy you!

01:29:19.685 --> 01:29:20.957
Destroy me...

01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:24.778
and the Scroll
will be gone forever.

01:29:58.782 --> 01:30:01.243
You may be willing
to sacrifice yourself...

01:30:01.369 --> 01:30:04.026
but are you willing
to watch him die first?

01:30:10.493 --> 01:30:12.137
The last verse...

01:30:13.496 --> 01:30:15.259
or I drop him.

01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:24.397
Kar! Remember...

01:30:25.642 --> 01:30:27.644
you can beat him!

01:31:01.778 --> 01:31:03.575
If I can't have it...

01:31:04.380 --> 01:31:08.407
I will take you
and the Scroll with me!

01:31:08.451 --> 01:31:11.889
For sixty years, I have given
you the chance to change.

01:31:11.955 --> 01:31:14.112
I will never change!

01:31:43.495 --> 01:31:45.067
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:31:55.445 --> 01:31:56.864
It's over?

01:31:57.138 --> 01:31:58.591
Not yet.

01:32:03.606 --> 01:32:05.350
You are The Next, Kar.

01:32:06.509 --> 01:32:09.958
When you rescued them,
you fulfilled the Third Prophecy.

01:32:13.783 --> 01:32:18.393
My time has ended.
Yours has come.

01:33:19.482 --> 01:33:21.063
It is done.

01:33:27.457 --> 01:33:28.538
Look out!

01:34:09.991 --> 01:34:11.084
Jade?

01:34:22.278 --> 01:34:24.869
<i>He will defeat
an army of enemies...</i>

01:34:24.940 --> 01:34:28.287
<i>while a flock of cranes
circles above.</i>

01:34:28.298 --> 01:34:31.788
<i>Come on. I'm bored
with beating on this loser.</i>

01:34:33.009 --> 01:34:36.253
<i>He will battle for love
in a palace of jade.</i>

01:34:39.616 --> 01:34:41.798
<i>He will free the brothers
he never knew</i>

01:34:41.798 --> 01:34:43.569
<i>with the family
he never had.</i>

01:34:43.569 --> 01:34:46.107
You both fulfilled
the Prophecies.

01:34:46.107 --> 01:34:48.547
Not two lives
that are incomplete...

01:34:49.138 --> 01:34:51.816
one complete life.

01:35:15.175 --> 01:35:19.057
I guess you're not the only one
that's bulletproof.

01:35:43.823 --> 01:35:44.931
Kar.

01:35:56.072 --> 01:35:58.285
Your preparation
is complete.

01:35:58.380 --> 01:36:01.305
Except for...
one last thing.

01:36:03.413 --> 01:36:06.525
The final verse of the Scroll.

01:36:14.991 --> 01:36:17.278
And the second part.

01:36:24.742 --> 01:36:27.225
Now you are inseparable.

01:36:27.970 --> 01:36:30.626
The unity of opposites.

01:36:31.908 --> 01:36:33.825
Enjoy your vacation.

01:36:46.637 --> 01:36:47.631
What are you doing?

01:36:47.684 --> 01:36:50.822
Checking to see
nothing is missing.

01:36:51.461 --> 01:36:56.742
I remember the first hug
you gave me.

01:36:59.102 --> 01:37:00.191
Hey.

01:37:02.238 --> 01:37:04.944
So, I, uh,
I figured it out.

01:37:05.369 --> 01:37:07.499
Why hot dogs come
in packages of ten

01:37:07.499 --> 01:37:10.619
and... hot dog buns
come in packages of eight?

01:37:12.237 --> 01:37:13.602
See, the thing is, uh...

01:37:13.832 --> 01:37:15.907
Life doesn't always work out
according to plan...

01:37:16.134 --> 01:37:19.066
so... be happy
with what you got...

01:37:19.282 --> 01:37:20.893
cause you can always
get a hot dog.

01:37:20.893 --> 01:37:23.304
You got it.
