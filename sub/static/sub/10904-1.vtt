00:14.640 --> 00:17.473
There is a place

00:17.520 --> 00:22.150
That is so hard to find

00:25.520 --> 00:28.273
Behind the walls

00:28.320 --> 00:33.633
We build inside our minds

00:34.600 --> 00:38.912
Some break the walls
some break the rules

00:38.960 --> 00:44.273
Some even get things changed

00:45.560 --> 00:49.553
And when they do
that leads to the truth

00:49.600 --> 00:53.388
Yet questions still remain

00:53.440 --> 00:56.193
But all that it's saying

00:56.240 --> 01:01.553
Somewhere in life
there's a joy to be

01:01.600 --> 01:07.038
Between the hope and reality

01:07.080 --> 01:10.755
There in a mirror
and then the street

01:10.800 --> 01:14.918
That's where you'll find

01:14.960 --> 01:19.909
People in search of a life

01:29.840 --> 01:32.434
And what of love

01:32.480 --> 01:37.270
Is that a point of view

01:40.320 --> 01:42.834
And when you're alone

01:42.880 --> 01:48.000
It can seem so confused

01:49.880 --> 01:53.998
That's when a friend
can pull you in

01:54.040 --> 01:59.068
Lend you a helping hand

02:00.280 --> 02:04.239
But what happens when
your only friend

02:04.280 --> 02:08.592
Sells you out in the end

02:08.639 --> 02:11.108
How do you face it

02:11.160 --> 02:16.314
Somewhere in life
there's a joy to be

02:16.360 --> 02:21.878
Between the hope and reality

02:21.920 --> 02:25.595
There in a mirror
and then the street

02:25.640 --> 02:29.952
That's where you'll find

02:30.000 --> 02:33.834
People in search of a life

02:33.880 --> 02:37.236
In search of a life

02:39.800 --> 02:43.270
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

02:45.800 --> 02:49.236
Searchin'

02:50.800 --> 02:53.439
Lookin' in a bottle

02:59.440 --> 03:01.670
Lookin' in a needle

03:04.760 --> 03:09.231
Lookin' in the street,
yeah, yeah, yeah

03:10.600 --> 03:15.879
Searchin'

03:17.680 --> 03:19.955
Everywhere

03:24.280 --> 03:34.030
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh

03:34.080 --> 03:36.275
Oh-oh-oh

03:44.840 --> 03:46.273
Straight from Brooklyn
better known as Crooklyn

03:46.320 --> 03:48.072
Never take us short
cos Brooklyn's the borough

03:48.120 --> 03:50.236
Straight from Brooklyn
better known as Crooklyn

03:50.280 --> 03:52.874
Never take us short
cos Brooklyn's the borough

03:52.920 --> 03:55.229
We did it like that
and now we do it like this

03:55.520 --> 03:57.909
We did it like that
and now we do it like this

04:00.200 --> 04:02.077
Yeah.

04:02.120 --> 04:05.237
Now the clock hits
who got the cocaine

04:05.280 --> 04:07.874
Don't tell me it's
the little kids on Soul Train

04:07.920 --> 04:10.036
The metaphor sent
from my brain to my jaw

04:10.080 --> 04:12.435
It comes from other places
not the typical places

04:12.480 --> 04:14.755
Journalistic values are yellow
and then the court falters

04:14.800 --> 04:17.632
You watch Channel Zero
and that bitch Barbara Walters

04:17.680 --> 04:19.875
She'll have you believe
black invented crack

04:19.920 --> 04:23.356
When President Lyndon had to form
a law way back in '63 with Kennedy

04:23.400 --> 04:24.674
Yes, the double-cross

04:24.720 --> 04:27.359
Remember that's when they blew
his fucking head off

04:27.400 --> 04:30.790
Vietnam vets come back lookin'
like one-armed pets

04:30.840 --> 04:32.717
Mixin' thoughts, purer text

04:32.760 --> 04:35.228
No picket fence,
no job, no ATM in the car

04:35.280 --> 04:37.111
Blue collar comes to bourgeois

04:37.160 --> 04:39.116
Depressed in your chest...

04:39.160 --> 04:41.594
- Chuck D is the bomb, boy.
- What?

04:41.640 --> 04:44.438
Get the fuck outta here.
Chuck D ain't shit.

04:44.480 --> 04:48.075
That nigger Chuck D is assed out,
and the rest of Public Enemy.

04:48.120 --> 04:50.475
Speech, motherfucker. What about him?

04:50.520 --> 04:52.158
Speech? He a bitch-ass nigger.

04:52.200 --> 04:55.431
How the fuck this thing gonna say
Chuck D the hardest rapper?

04:55.480 --> 04:59.109
- Nigger ain't never shot nobody.
- You gotta be hard nowadays!

04:59.160 --> 05:01.833
First, I know niggers
ain't slappin' bitches up.

05:01.880 --> 05:03.632
They ain't takin' pussy.

05:03.680 --> 05:06.717
Niggers ain't shootin' up,
ain't done time for murder.

05:06.760 --> 05:08.193
How the fuck they hard?

05:08.240 --> 05:11.676
Do what you gonna do. I ain't buyin'
shit that ain't hard-core.

05:11.720 --> 05:14.598
You ain't gotta shoot nobody
to prove you're hard-core.

05:14.640 --> 05:16.471
- What kinda shit is that?
- Hold on.

05:16.520 --> 05:20.399
Only niggers I have representin'
is my man Tupac, G-Rap and Wu-Tang.

05:20.440 --> 05:24.035
- Motherfuckin' Dr Dre, straight up.
- You said it. No fuckin' around.

05:24.080 --> 05:26.310
Niggers talkin'
all this positive shit.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.669
Motherfuckin' world ain't positive.

05:28.720 --> 05:32.508
That's why motherfuckin'
sex and violence sell more records.

05:32.560 --> 05:34.551
I like positive rappers, get it?

05:34.600 --> 05:39.799
- Get the fuck outta here.
- Them niggers ain't homeboys.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.957
Put them poor-ass niggers over there.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.479
Come on, come on, yo, yo.

05:44.520 --> 05:47.557

Get your ass over there!
You supposed to be on the lookout.

05:55.560 --> 05:58.597
- This ain't no joke.
- It's hot outside, man.

05:58.640 --> 06:00.870
We gots to get that money.

06:00.920 --> 06:03.309
I understand that, too,
but it's hot, man.

Two? All right, brother.

- Yeah.

06:42.280 --> 06:44.350
Shit, you know that, man.

06:48.200 --> 06:51.272
Children of the ghetto

06:55.120 --> 06:58.954
Runnin' wild and free

07:02.720 --> 07:06.315
In a country's jungle

07:09.960 --> 07:14.158
Filled with misery

07:17.480 --> 07:20.278
There's no inspiration...

07:22.000 --> 07:24.594
What's up, man?
You got the money?

07:24.640 --> 07:27.552
To brighten up their day...

07:27.600 --> 07:29.909
Keep an eye out, all right?

07:30.880 --> 07:33.155
Raise up!

Motherfucker! Come here!

Stand the fuck up.

07:53.720 --> 07:56.439
Where the vials at, man?
I know you're carrying.

07:56.520 --> 07:59.637
Collars for dollars. What the fuck

07:59.680 --> 08:01.750
Yes, yes. Ah, gotcha.

08:01.800 --> 08:04.439

- Don't be touchin' me, man.

08:04.480 --> 08:06.311

08:06.360 --> 08:09.397
Get off my ass! I don't be playin'

08:09.440 --> 08:12.318
- I love the smell of surprise...
- Smell your fuckin' breath.

08:12.360 --> 08:15.272
It smells
like victory, brother!

08:19.280 --> 08:23.239
Always in the news

08:26.560 --> 08:29.791
Toughness is their motto

08:33.760 --> 08:38.275
And bitter are their blues...

08:39.280 --> 08:43.432
Open your fuckin' mouth.
Lift up your fuckin' tongue.

08:43.480 --> 08:45.755
Lemme see under your tongue. Open.

08:46.960 --> 08:50.111

Yo, Rodney.

10:18.520 --> 10:20.511
I'm tellin' you.

10:23.480 --> 10:26.711
Maybe you won't have to
take it much longer.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.117
You know who that is?
That's Darryl.

10:56.160 --> 11:00.153
That's Darryl Adams, the thief.
That's who that is.

11:00.200 --> 11:02.077
He's stealin' from me.

11:02.120 --> 11:05.669
Layin' back in the cut, passin'
some baggies and rakin' in the dough.

11:05.720 --> 11:10.191
Nice indoors work, huh, Darryl?.
Clean, safe.

11:10.240 --> 11:12.834
You got this clown

11:12.880 --> 11:14.518
Why him? What's up with me?

11:14.560 --> 11:17.028
Cos you like my son, man.

11:18.160 --> 11:19.912
Strike, my son.

If I'm so much your son, why my black
ass always on them benches?

11:23.160 --> 11:25.993
I need you to be
where I need you to be.

11:26.040 --> 11:28.190
Had this dream last night.

11:29.240 --> 11:31.674
I'm standin' in the desert
with all my kids.

11:31.720 --> 11:34.359
My for-real kids,
my kids from the store.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.675
They's all laid out in front
of me like they's my army.

11:40.040 --> 11:42.395
God comes up, points at you.

11:43.160 --> 11:47.995
Tells me, "This one right here is
gonna be your sword and your staff. "

11:49.720 --> 11:51.711
God, man. God said that.

11:51.760 --> 11:53.955
He pointed right at you.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.912
Darryl Adams wasn't even in
the motherfuckin' dream,

11:57.960 --> 12:00.758

12:00.800 --> 12:03.234

12:08.000 --> 12:11.037
You know Errol

12:11.080 --> 12:13.230
The virus.

12:14.240 --> 12:16.993
My man messed around

12:18.280 --> 12:20.510
Anyway, can you see Errol in there,

12:20.560 --> 12:24.917

15:44.680 --> 15:45.999
Who?

15:46.040 --> 15:48.235
- My Man.
- Well, who that?

15:48.280 --> 15:51.352
Look, My Man. A friend of a friend.

15:52.400 --> 15:54.118
He'll do the job.

15:54.160 --> 15:57.311
- How much he talkin' about?
- Nothin'.

15:57.360 --> 15:59.237
So what's the deal?.

16:00.480 --> 16:02.914
I'm listenin'.
What you want me to do?

16:02.960 --> 16:06.270
Nothin', man. All right?
Just chill. All right?

16:06.320 --> 16:09.198
So my little mans,
my nephews, how they doin'?

16:13.280 --> 16:15.236
I miss my kids, man.

16:15.280 --> 16:17.635
Why don't you just
take your ass home then?

16:32.560 --> 16:35.438
There's the motherfucker.
What's up, Strike?

16:36.600 --> 16:38.113
Yo, black, we closed.

16:38.160 --> 16:40.720
Besides, I thought
you don't eat this shit

16:40.760 --> 16:42.990
because it fucks with your stomach.

16:43.040 --> 16:44.553
This is Ahab's, nigger.

16:44.600 --> 16:49.071
We ain't got no Di-Gel,
no Kaopectate, no pussy-Bismol!

16:51.280 --> 16:53.919
Boom! Gotcha!

16:58.280 --> 17:00.191
Boom. Gotcha.

17:00.240 --> 17:03.357
You still here, motherfucker?
What's up?

17:03.400 --> 17:07.473
Mylanta! We need more Mylanta
out here for this girl!

17:07.520 --> 17:09.032
Boom!

17:11.599 --> 17:13.238
Probably a fuckin' triple-header.

17:13.280 --> 17:15.430
Outdoors in the mud,
60 casings around,

17:15.480 --> 17:19.598
and a big herd of Nubians
stepping all over everything, man.

17:23.079 --> 17:25.752
- Alla salute.
- Mazel tov.

17:28.600 --> 17:31.797
Ahh! I just don't like
them aeroplane bottles.

18:00.520 --> 18:02.590
What the fuck happened?

18:02.640 --> 18:05.393
- Oh, that boy got shot up!
- Who did?

18:09.000 --> 18:12.629
I wouldn't know. I wasn't here, so
I can't talk intelligently about it.

18:12.680 --> 18:16.639
Yo, uh... I wouldn't want you
not to talk intelligently.

18:18.800 --> 18:20.870
The body cold already.

18:20.920 --> 18:23.593
Excuse me. Coming through. Thank you.

18:23.640 --> 18:25.835
Damn! Excuse me

18:27.400 --> 18:30.119
Hey! Welcome to the show
that never ends.

18:30.160 --> 18:32.037
Bartucci, what you got?

18:32.080 --> 18:35.197
We got a black male, dead man.
Darryl Adams, 22 years old.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.390
He's the night manager of this joint.

18:37.440 --> 18:40.955
Kid's standin' by the door having
a conversation with another male.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.468
Pop, pop, poppity-pop.
Darryl goes down.

18:43.520 --> 18:45.317
Shooter does a Carl Lewis.

18:45.360 --> 18:48.238
Neighbourhood says
there's four shots fired.

18:48.280 --> 18:50.350
At this point, that's all she wrote.

18:50.400 --> 18:52.834
- Robbery?
- Nah. Way too fast.

18:52.880 --> 18:54.871
Drugs? Was he a scumbag?

18:54.920 --> 18:57.912
To tell you the truth,
I never seen this kid before.

19:01.200 --> 19:03.794
Boys, Darryl Adams.
Darryl Adams, the boys.

19:03.840 --> 19:06.718
- Hey, Darryl.
- Hello in there.

19:08.160 --> 19:10.674
Live by the gun,
die by the gun.

19:12.040 --> 19:15.350
- The kid had brains.
- Good thing he was wearin' his gold.

19:15.400 --> 19:17.311
Bing, bing, bing. Ricochet Rabbit.

19:17.360 --> 19:19.351
I still think it was the food here.

19:19.400 --> 19:21.789
Hal, get in there,
tell me what you got.

19:24.040 --> 19:26.156
There she blows.

19:26.200 --> 19:28.589
Let's see.
No powder burns on the face.

19:28.640 --> 19:33.077
- These eyes have lied.
- Looking about 30, 35 years old.

19:33.120 --> 19:35.350
- Doors one and two.
- OK, let's see.

19:35.400 --> 19:36.719
Nothin' up the sleeve.

19:36.760 --> 19:39.228
He might get better,
but he ain't never gettin' well.

19:39.280 --> 19:41.191
- And presto!
- Hey, slapped him five.

19:41.240 --> 19:43.151
On the light hand side.

19:43.200 --> 19:46.829
Hey, look at that. Looks like some
kind of an Egyptian peace sign.

19:46.880 --> 19:49.792
You're right there. It says goodbye.

19:49.840 --> 19:52.752
Hey, Moe. My main man.
Gonna need prints off that door.

19:52.800 --> 19:55.473
Fuck you, Rocco.
That'll really narrow it down

19:55.520 --> 19:57.954
We'll get half the yos
in Brooklyn off this door.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.434
- What, did you eat at Ahab's Burger?
- Yeah.

20:00.480 --> 20:02.630
- You owe me six more.
- I love my job, too.

20:02.680 --> 20:04.159
More prints than my ex-wife.

20:04.200 --> 20:06.839
- He wearing any?
- Be with you in a second.

20:06.880 --> 20:09.553
Must be his golf jacket.
It's got 18 holes.

20:10.040 --> 20:11.917
Oh, Christ!

20:13.160 --> 20:14.434
What the fuck did he eat?

20:14.480 --> 20:16.550
Come out, come out,
wherever you are

20:16.600 --> 20:18.795
The monkey's on the trolley car

20:18.840 --> 20:22.150
Looks like they did come out.
Here's one. Two. Two exits.

20:22.200 --> 20:23.758
What's the grapevine say?

20:23.800 --> 20:27.076
What they always say.
"We keep our ear to the grindstone. "

20:27.120 --> 20:29.429
- Was he clockin'?
- I don't know.

20:29.480 --> 20:31.516
- Hal, how ya doin'?
- How ya doin', Lar.

20:31.560 --> 20:33.471
- Check the pockets.
- Yeah.

20:33.520 --> 20:36.034
Son of a bitch! That's Darryl Adams!

20:36.080 --> 20:37.195
Who?

20:37.240 --> 20:39.800
He worked in Rodney's candy store.
I saw him a lot.

20:39.840 --> 20:42.149
If he worked for Rodney,
he was clockin'.

20:42.200 --> 20:45.237
- Hal, check the pockets again.
- Sure. Hold on.

20:45.280 --> 20:47.396
- Nothin'.
- What's up, Darryl?.

20:49.160 --> 20:52.550
Clockin' like a motherfucker, man.

20:52.640 --> 20:54.596
You guys done yet?

20:54.640 --> 20:57.279
Ho! Marvello the magician!

20:57.320 --> 21:00.232
- Catch a bullet with his teeth.
- What a catch!

21:00.280 --> 21:03.431
- What a smile.
- Darryl, you've outdone Willie Mays.

21:03.480 --> 21:05.038
You got my vote for MVP.

21:05.080 --> 21:07.753
Another stain on the sidewalk, huh?

21:09.640 --> 21:12.200
Get a pail and a mop.
Get it over with.

21:12.240 --> 21:13.355
One, two, three.

21:16.440 --> 21:17.839
Arrivederci!

21:17.880 --> 21:21.793
All right. Show's over!
Officers, send 'em home!

21:21.840 --> 21:23.558
- See ya, Hal.
- Take care.

21:23.600 --> 21:26.990
Yo, Moe, don't make me have to come
back for those fuckin' prints!

21:27.040 --> 21:29.474
- What you cursin' about?
- I'm sorry.

21:32.520 --> 21:34.317
Beep beep.

21:35.520 --> 21:37.670
Excuse me.

21:37.720 --> 21:39.790
All right. I won't do it gain.

21:39.840 --> 21:41.831
I'm outta here, man.

21:49.880 --> 21:52.997
- Got 50 bucks?
- Nah, man.

21:53.440 --> 21:55.715
Well, all I find, all I keep.

21:59.160 --> 22:01.674
Don't be lookin' at me
in the eye, nigger.

22:01.720 --> 22:04.996
Your ass will be on this mural, too.
I know that look.

22:05.040 --> 22:09.477
See, you wonderin' how
I got that AIDS, ain't ya?

22:09.520 --> 22:12.956
- Nah, man.
- You a lyin' motherfucker!

22:13.000 --> 22:15.719
It wasn't from fuckin'
with them punks.

22:15.760 --> 22:17.910
I ain't no homosexual.

22:17.960 --> 22:20.758
No, man, I ain't say
all that, all right?

22:20.800 --> 22:23.155
Fuckin' with this shit.

22:26.360 --> 22:28.590
I can't believe I got this shit.

22:28.640 --> 22:32.792
All this time
in these motherfuckin' streets!

22:32.840 --> 22:35.718
And I'm a smart motherfucker.

22:36.800 --> 22:39.598
I know I should've
left that shit alone.

22:40.840 --> 22:43.638
One time I was studyin'
to be an accountant.

22:45.280 --> 22:49.831
Now this shit is fuckin' my body up.
I have a goddam death sentence.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.834
That's why I don't
give a shit about nobody.

22:54.880 --> 22:57.474
And I don't wanna
see your ass no more!

22:58.280 --> 23:02.239
Cos you ain't got no business
out here fuckin' with this shit.

23:02.280 --> 23:05.477
You'll end up like me. Or worse.

23:06.920 --> 23:08.672
My old man...

23:08.720 --> 23:10.915
was a preacher.

23:13.400 --> 23:17.075
And when I started messin'
with this shit,

23:18.960 --> 23:21.190
he said, "You gonna pay for that.

23:23.160 --> 23:25.833
"You gonna pay for that shit, boy. "

23:28.000 --> 23:30.639
He was right.

23:30.680 --> 23:35.549
You can't cheat this shit no... mo'.

23:35.600 --> 23:37.591
Get the fuck outta here!

23:40.880 --> 23:43.678
Why you wanna be
always arguin' with me?

23:43.720 --> 23:46.712
No, wait. Listen to me.
How many pair sneakers you got?

23:46.760 --> 23:49.035
- The pair I got on makes six.
- Yo, Rodney.

23:49.080 --> 23:52.277
- Wait a second. Six, right?
- Yeah.

23:52.320 --> 23:55.790
- How many pair o' feet you got?
- Two, like everybody else.

23:55.840 --> 23:58.354
He don't see what I'm talkin' about.

23:58.400 --> 24:00.470
- You don't, do you?
- What, man?

24:00.520 --> 24:04.229
How you gonna make ten and spend ten,
nigger? Ten minus ten make what?

24:04.280 --> 24:06.396
- Zero.
- You wanna be a zero nigger?

24:06.440 --> 24:08.908
- I don't want me no zero nigger.
- You ain't got one.

24:08.960 --> 24:11.520
Right. Now you see
what I'm sayin' to you?

24:11.560 --> 24:13.949
Nigger wanna spend
all his money like that

24:14.000 --> 24:16.309
gonna wake up broke
every day of his life.

24:16.360 --> 24:19.716
Why? Cos the nigger
don't believe in hisself.

24:19.760 --> 24:22.957
Thinkin' like a two-minute clock
instead of the long haul.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.638
Long term. See your future.

24:24.680 --> 24:27.831
Y'all come work for me,
this shit gonna be very different.

24:27.880 --> 24:29.518
You gonna be savin' crazy money.

24:29.560 --> 24:33.189
You gonna buy your moms
a house in Strong Island. Right?

24:38.800 --> 24:42.076
Everybody stick out your hands
like this, palm down.

24:43.680 --> 24:46.194
- What you all see?
- Black.

24:46.240 --> 24:48.959
- What you see?
- You 'posed to be seein' green.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.036
All right. You get it, man?

24:51.080 --> 24:53.196
No. You get it, nigger? You get it?

24:53.240 --> 24:54.468
- I got it.
- All right.

24:58.240 --> 24:59.514
Excuse me. Excuse me.

24:59.560 --> 25:02.313
- You all have a job to do inside?
- Yeah.

25:02.360 --> 25:05.750
Well, let's go. Who trash?

25:13.160 --> 25:14.878
What's the matter with you?

25:14.920 --> 25:17.434
Man, you ain't heard what happened?

25:17.480 --> 25:19.835
I ain't heard nothin'.

25:19.880 --> 25:22.997
You told me if I wanted
to get off them benches...

25:23.040 --> 25:24.314
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:24.360 --> 25:28.239
All's I hear is that Ahab's
lookin' for a new night manager.

25:28.280 --> 25:29.793
I heard that.

25:32.280 --> 25:35.829
Look here. You gonna chill
for a week or two, right?

25:35.880 --> 25:39.589
Let the shit die down.
Be workin' still at my spot.

25:39.640 --> 25:43.076
You gonna be on the benches,
but Ahab is the joint.

25:43.120 --> 25:46.476
I'm tellin' you.
I got it. I'm all right.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.271
Nigger look bad, boy.

25:51.320 --> 25:55.233
What we're gonna do, we're gonna mix
the shit up with the food traffic.

25:55.280 --> 25:59.558
Right? See, right now, we're doin'
way too much business from my spot.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.556
We got a crowd of black,
white customers,

26:01.600 --> 26:04.194
out-of-state license plates,
what have you.

26:04.240 --> 26:09.030
Somebody gonna check that out. They
gonna drop a dime on me, call 911.

26:09.080 --> 26:11.753
With my jacket,
I can't go back to jail.

26:11.800 --> 26:15.110
Ahab gonna be a nice front.
You did good, Strike.

26:15.160 --> 26:16.559
You did good.

26:16.600 --> 26:20.832
Now why you lookin' like that?
Somethin' wrong?

26:20.880 --> 26:22.677
Huh?

26:24.760 --> 26:27.593
You know it's me and you, right?

26:27.640 --> 26:30.791
What I tell you?
You like my son, right?

26:30.840 --> 26:33.957
I'm gonna look out for you. Right?

26:34.000 --> 26:36.639
- I ain't let you down yet, have I?
- Nah.

26:36.680 --> 26:38.238
OK, then.

26:38.280 --> 26:41.352
Come in here. I'm gonna get
somethin' to eat for you.

26:41.400 --> 26:43.197
Come on.

26:47.920 --> 26:49.194
Strike. What's up with
that train set you got?

26:49.240 --> 26:51.800
- It's all right.
- Fuckin' Choo-Choo Charlie.

26:51.840 --> 26:54.593
You readin' a train book? Choo-choo!

26:54.640 --> 26:58.110
Every man should have a hobby.
What's yours? Collectin' welfare?

26:58.160 --> 27:02.233
That shit ain't funny, man. Word up.
Why you tryin' to play me, Strike?

27:02.280 --> 27:04.475
I don't talk about them...
Fuck that, man!

27:04.520 --> 27:07.193
I don't talk about them toys
inside your crib.

27:07.240 --> 27:09.959
Yeah, I know, cos I'll
bust your motherfuckin' ass.

27:11.960 --> 27:14.520
Yo, Shorty, what you laughin' at?

27:17.360 --> 27:20.875
- One time says freeze!
- Fuck!

27:23.560 --> 27:25.835
Hey, little man. Stay right there.

27:27.280 --> 27:29.316
Stand up, mastermind.

27:32.880 --> 27:36.429
Hmm. Oh. Is that Rodney?

27:36.480 --> 27:38.710
- Rodney rang?
- You oughtta know.

27:39.680 --> 27:42.717
- Y'all hear that noise about Darryl?.
- Yeah, man.

27:42.760 --> 27:45.991
Yeah, well, I had to tell
his moms and pops last night.

27:46.040 --> 27:48.429
That ain't no joke. I hate it.

27:48.480 --> 27:49.959
Rough.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.231
I just hope I never have to notify
none of your parents.

27:53.280 --> 27:55.271
Leave this shit alone!

27:57.840 --> 28:00.718
How them trains comin'?

28:03.440 --> 28:05.795
Little man, come here. Come here.

28:08.080 --> 28:12.312
What'd I tell you about bein' around
these knuckleheads? Huh?

28:12.360 --> 28:16.672
Now, I'm watchin' you.
Go on upstairs.

28:16.720 --> 28:20.474
Yo, Andre. Why don't you go chase
some criminals or somethin'?

28:32.920 --> 28:35.309
Yo, Shorty. What you lookin' at?

28:35.360 --> 28:38.716
Yo, come here, man.
Yeah, you. Come here.

28:38.760 --> 28:41.638
Come on. Hurry up.

28:43.400 --> 28:45.197
Come here.

28:46.440 --> 28:49.512
God damn, Shorty!
This is some nappy shit.

28:49.560 --> 28:52.279
When the last time you been
in a barber shop?

28:52.320 --> 28:53.469
I don't know.

28:58.200 --> 29:00.191
'Put your hands up. '

29:00.240 --> 29:03.710
Ding-ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding!

29:03.760 --> 29:05.478
Watch out. Flip. Shoot.

29:07.960 --> 29:09.188
Yo.

29:09.240 --> 29:13.199
Watch out! Duck! Now what? Come on.
Throw us somethin' else.

29:13.240 --> 29:14.355
Yo!

29:14.400 --> 29:16.709
- Where you manners at?
- Thanks.

29:16.760 --> 29:19.149
- What's your name, Shorty?
- Tyrone Jeeter.

29:19.200 --> 29:21.509
All right. Shorty.

29:22.320 --> 29:25.995
Yo, there goes
my brother, Victor. Shit.

29:26.040 --> 29:27.917
- Wait here, all right?
- All right.

29:27.960 --> 29:29.951
Be right back.

29:35.600 --> 29:37.272
Vic!

30:00.360 --> 30:03.193
Uh! Watch out! Oh, man!

30:03.240 --> 30:05.629
Uh! Uh! Flip!

30:22.120 --> 30:25.237
- Who did this? Huh? Who did this?
- ¿Qué?

30:25.280 --> 30:28.636
Who did this? Who did this?
Who did this?

30:28.680 --> 30:31.240
Who did this? Who did this?

30:31.280 --> 30:34.795
Who's tryin' to be my son's daddy
and gave him this haircut?

30:34.840 --> 30:38.674
Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?

30:39.960 --> 30:42.190
Nobody don't know
nothin' now, huh?

30:42.240 --> 30:44.629
Yo no se nada.

30:44.680 --> 30:48.309
I know you. I know you.

30:48.360 --> 30:50.999
Cedric Stanley Gilmore.

30:53.400 --> 30:56.358
And I know you, too. Ronnie Dunham.

30:56.400 --> 30:57.833
Shit.

30:57.880 --> 31:00.440
You used to live
next door to me, remember?

31:00.480 --> 31:04.951
I know your mother. Gloria.

31:05.000 --> 31:11.155
You all ain't nothin' but a bunch of
good-for-nothin', death-dealin' scum.

31:11.200 --> 31:14.078
I find out who's been
messin' with Tyrone,

31:14.120 --> 31:18.511
I'm gonna put a bullet
in your butt my own damn self.

31:18.560 --> 31:21.233
Don't let me find Andre either.

31:23.680 --> 31:25.750
Have a good Sunday.

31:30.920 --> 31:34.117
Shit. I know that bitch
ain't talkin' to me.

31:34.160 --> 31:36.071
- Scientific, man, shut up.
- You shut up, man.

31:38.640 --> 31:45.716
OK, Victor? Ready to go?

31:50.520 --> 31:52.590
Normally I'd cuff you, brother,

31:52.640 --> 31:55.234
but you look like
the kind of guy I can trust.

31:58.840 --> 32:02.071
Like I said.
I had some drinks at Kool Breeze.

32:02.120 --> 32:04.759
- Uh, Scotch.
- "Some"?

32:04.800 --> 32:07.075
Like two or three.

32:07.120 --> 32:10.237
I usually go in there
after most work nights.

32:10.280 --> 32:13.238
Uh-huh. How long were you in there?

32:13.280 --> 32:17.034
Uh, I don't know.
About eight-thirty till about ten.

32:17.080 --> 32:20.231
Uh, see... My shift... at Hambones -

32:20.280 --> 32:22.589
I'm a... I'm a manager.

32:23.600 --> 32:25.397
It don't end till ten.

32:25.440 --> 32:28.273
I wasn't feelin' very good,
so I left early.

32:29.640 --> 32:32.791
You weren't feelin' good,
so you went to Kool Breeze?

32:33.640 --> 32:38.509
It wasn't like it was a "goin' home"
not feelin' good.

32:38.560 --> 32:41.074
You had a headache? An argument?

32:45.400 --> 32:47.595
No, I just... just tired, man.

32:49.080 --> 32:50.513
Go ahead.

32:50.560 --> 32:54.439
So I left Kool Breeze,
uh, started walkin' home.

32:54.480 --> 32:56.948
I cut through Ahab's parking lot.

32:57.000 --> 33:00.470
And this guy just flexed on me, man.
He jumped outta nowhere.

33:00.520 --> 33:03.239
I got scared. You know the rest.

33:03.280 --> 33:05.271
Tell me, Victor.

33:07.200 --> 33:09.191
I just... I shot him.

33:10.640 --> 33:13.234
Hey, little man.
I like that cut.

33:13.280 --> 33:15.874
- Where'd you get it?
- Barber shop.

33:22.960 --> 33:26.794
You know, you used to have
a good head on your shoulders

33:26.840 --> 33:28.796
before Rodney got a hold of you.

33:28.840 --> 33:31.070
Still do.

33:31.120 --> 33:35.989
You know, Ronald, I been lookin' out
for you since you been yea high.

33:36.040 --> 33:39.828
Now, you don't want my guidance?
Fine. It's your life.

33:39.880 --> 33:41.871
Let me tell you somethin'.

33:41.920 --> 33:45.515
You even glance in the direction
of that little kid Tyrone,

33:45.560 --> 33:49.155
and I'm gonna fuck you up so bad
you're gonna wish I had killed you.

33:49.200 --> 33:51.919
Now, do we have an understanding?

33:51.960 --> 33:54.793
Do we have an understanding?

33:54.840 --> 33:57.400
Yeah.

33:57.440 --> 34:00.318
Why do we keep goin' through this?
I told you already.

34:00.360 --> 34:05.070
The guy jumped outta nowhere, I
got scared... Bam! Then I ran. I ran!

34:05.120 --> 34:06.838
You mean bam, bam, bam, bam.

34:06.880 --> 34:09.838
- What?
- Four bullets in the body.

34:10.920 --> 34:13.956
- Where did you carry the gun?
- In my gym bag.

34:15.040 --> 34:16.632
What else you carry in it?

34:18.320 --> 34:21.915
My uniform from Hambones,
a sandwich from home.

34:21.960 --> 34:24.554
I don't eat Hambones myself,
as quiet as it's kept.

34:24.600 --> 34:28.639
OK. Was the, uh,
gym bag zippered, locked?

34:30.360 --> 34:32.351
Don't shake your head, Victor.

34:32.400 --> 34:34.755
- Where's my mattresses?
- What?

34:34.800 --> 34:37.360
I told you about my mattresses
for them kids.

34:37.400 --> 34:41.678
They ask, "You say we gonna have
a tumblin' club. We need mattresses. "

34:41.719 --> 34:45.793
And I say, "Well, Strike's
buyin' 'em. He promised. "

34:45.840 --> 34:48.070
Now, look, I ain't busted you yet,

34:48.120 --> 34:51.954
but till I do,
you gonna be my main benefactor.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.878
You gonna sponsor this club,
you understand me?

34:54.920 --> 34:58.754
And, Ronald, I'm only tellin'
you one more time, you hear?

34:59.800 --> 35:02.598
The store was closed.
One of them Jewish holidays.

35:02.640 --> 35:05.916
- What Jewish holiday?
- I don't know. Pick one.

35:05.960 --> 35:09.396
Tomorrow, all right?
I swear, I'll swing by tomorrow.

35:09.440 --> 35:12.238
Andre, these cuffs is too tight, man.

35:12.280 --> 35:14.157
You and me used to be tight.

35:14.200 --> 35:18.671
Am I under arrest?
What for?

35:19.720 --> 35:22.951
Could you uncuff me, please,
and let me outta here?

35:23.000 --> 35:25.275
You don't have to live like this.

35:26.680 --> 35:30.116
There's more than just these projects
out there, you know.

35:30.160 --> 35:32.674
Don't you wanna go someplace
you never been?

35:32.720 --> 35:36.269
I mean, you love trains,
but you've only ridden the subway.

35:39.960 --> 35:41.871
Go on, man. Get outta here.

35:41.920 --> 35:44.559
And get them mattresses
for my kids, hear?

35:45.520 --> 35:48.557
- Never.
- Never?

35:48.600 --> 35:51.592
You never walked by
on a hot day with your two kids?

35:51.640 --> 35:54.200
- Stopped in for a soda?
- With my two kids?

35:54.240 --> 35:56.879
I barely see my two kids.
I'm always working.

35:56.920 --> 35:59.434
When I get home, I'm exhausted.

35:59.480 --> 36:01.118
Do you have any kids?

36:01.160 --> 36:03.958
Yeah. I have
a two-year-old daughter.

36:04.640 --> 36:07.757
Have you ever come home so tired

36:07.800 --> 36:11.315
you hated the sound
of your own kids cryin'?

36:12.280 --> 36:14.555
Your own flesh and blood.

36:15.600 --> 36:18.353
My wife, Sharon, says,
"Quit a job. You got two. "

36:18.400 --> 36:21.870
What the hell she thinks I got
two jobs for in the first place?

36:21.920 --> 36:24.229
Look, I'm... I'm tryin', man.

36:24.280 --> 36:27.317
I am really tryin'
to move us out of the projects.

36:27.360 --> 36:29.157
You know what I'm sayin'?

36:29.200 --> 36:33.512
I'm working, I'm saving,
I'm trying to do the best I can.

36:34.560 --> 36:37.313
Provide those ends. I gotta work.

36:38.320 --> 36:41.118
I'm never late. I gotta work.

36:42.720 --> 36:44.597
Victor, listen to me.

36:45.280 --> 36:48.636
You're a good, decent,
church-goin', God-fearin' kid.

36:48.680 --> 36:50.716
And if you did pull the trigger,

36:50.760 --> 36:55.356
there has to be a reasonable answer
other than what you've told me here.

36:55.400 --> 36:59.393
I gotta ask myself, why would Darryl,
the night manager at Ahab's,

36:59.440 --> 37:01.908
try to rob you
in his own parking lot?

37:03.600 --> 37:05.955
So I think it had to be personal.

37:06.000 --> 37:09.913
Mm-mm. No.
I never saw him before in my life.

37:09.960 --> 37:12.633
- He flexed, you shot?
- I'm through with it.

37:12.680 --> 37:15.672
I told you what happened.
What else do you want?

37:15.720 --> 37:17.950
- The truth.
- The truth is lookin' at you!

37:18.000 --> 37:22.596
If he did something, if he threatened
your family, this helps you.

37:22.640 --> 37:27.270
You were buggin' - "can't sleep,
can't eat". This helps you in court.

37:27.320 --> 37:30.118
What did that prick do to you?

37:34.240 --> 37:36.549
It was self-defence.

37:38.520 --> 37:40.954
Self-defence, huh?

37:44.240 --> 37:46.276
I wanna see what you see.

37:47.280 --> 37:49.999
Uh. I disagree.

37:50.040 --> 37:53.157
I don't think I do look
that fuckin' stupid.

37:57.760 --> 38:00.228
Dang, man. In the papers.

38:00.280 --> 38:02.953
I thought Vic was legit.
What happened?

38:03.000 --> 38:05.116
Boy already had like five jobs.

38:08.080 --> 38:09.479
Ooh-ooh!

38:09.520 --> 38:13.229
Aw, shit, man! What the fuck
the homo-cide want now?

38:18.600 --> 38:22.798
235 Hoyt,
Mandela projects, all right?

38:22.840 --> 38:25.229
- Yo, Tyrone.
- What's up?

38:25.280 --> 38:28.238
Come over here and watch
the car for me, all right?

38:28.280 --> 38:31.078
- All right?
- Yeah, cool. What you gonna give us?

38:31.120 --> 38:32.917
Catch you in a little bit.

38:32.960 --> 38:34.951
We ain't gonna do it
for free.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.150
I'll take care
of you later.

38:40.640 --> 38:43.359
Excuse me, sir.
Which building is 235 Hoyt?

38:43.400 --> 38:45.595
- Right there.
- Thank you.

39:06.760 --> 39:08.557
Is that Nintendo or Sega?

39:08.600 --> 39:10.591
- Sega.
- What's it called?

39:10.640 --> 39:13.632
- "Gangsta. "
- Whatever happened to Tiddlywinks?

39:14.480 --> 39:17.916
Rocco, don't you know this is
the new sensation across the nation?

39:17.960 --> 39:21.669
- Where you goin'?
- My friend's house.

39:22.440 --> 39:25.512
Everybody wants
to be a gangsta, right?

39:26.480 --> 39:30.234
Yeah, you like that, right?
You like lookin' at that, right?

39:30.280 --> 39:32.748
- Wanna know how much it costs.
- I know that.

39:32.800 --> 39:36.918
Yeah, I'm sure.
Probably want to buy one, right?

39:36.960 --> 39:39.155
How you know I don't got one?

39:40.200 --> 39:42.555
- Why did he have that gun?
- Everybody has one.

39:42.600 --> 39:45.034
- Does he drink a lot?
- He only drank at night.

39:45.080 --> 39:47.150
That makes two of us.

39:47.760 --> 39:51.070
- How about drugs?
- He's clean as the Board of Health.

39:51.120 --> 39:53.839
Did he have
any new friends recently?

39:53.880 --> 39:56.917
- Hangin' out with any new people?
- Not that I know of.

39:56.960 --> 40:00.953
You must be thinking of Ronald,
but he hasn't lived here in a while.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.116
- He's quite the athlete.
- Yes.

40:03.160 --> 40:06.038
- You boys must be proud of your dad.
- Yes.

40:06.080 --> 40:08.071
I'll bet. Something's not right.

40:08.120 --> 40:11.032
When I'm workin' on something,
I gotta make it right.

40:11.080 --> 40:15.119
These are my two sons,
Victor and Ronald.

40:15.160 --> 40:19.233
Victor's a hard-working,
handsome young man.

40:19.280 --> 40:23.353
He doesn't lie. If he said it was
self-defence, it was self-defence.

40:23.400 --> 40:25.038
Why don't you believe him?

40:25.080 --> 40:27.594
Do you mind
if I borrow these?

40:27.640 --> 40:31.155
I have to go around and retrace
his steps the other night,

40:31.200 --> 40:33.668
- and I'd rather not show a mug shot.
- Sure.

40:33.720 --> 40:36.393
You be good boys.
Take care of your mother.

40:36.440 --> 40:39.193
- Strike.
- You know him?

40:39.640 --> 40:41.278
He's an arrogant piece of shit.

40:41.320 --> 40:44.198
Comes into my store all the time
like he craps beige.

40:44.240 --> 40:48.677
He used to work with Rodney
last year in his store, with Darryl.

40:48.720 --> 40:50.711
Now he runs the crew on the benches.

40:50.760 --> 40:53.638
Clocks for Rodney just like Darryl.
Let's bring him in.

40:53.680 --> 40:56.240
- What up, man?
- They went to the ninth floor.

40:56.280 --> 40:58.430
Shit! I knew it.

40:59.080 --> 41:02.117
- Did they say anything?
- Asked me about "Gangsta".

41:02.160 --> 41:04.151
- Anything else?
- Nah.

41:04.200 --> 41:06.668
All right, Shorty.
You did good, man.

41:06.720 --> 41:09.359
Go upstairs before your mom
come down flippin'.

41:09.400 --> 41:10.992
All right.

41:11.880 --> 41:14.030
Go on upstairs.

41:15.080 --> 41:17.196
- Who you hidin' from?
- Come on, man.

41:17.240 --> 41:18.912
What you sneakin' up on me for?

41:18.960 --> 41:21.474
I'm not gonna keep tellin' you
to leave him be.

41:21.520 --> 41:23.875
- Tell him!
- How you feel about your brother?

41:23.920 --> 41:25.911
It's fucked up, man.

41:26.920 --> 41:29.434
I heard he confessed.
You been to see him?

41:29.480 --> 41:31.038
I'm goin'. I'm goin'.

41:31.080 --> 41:34.356
You need to have your stomach
checked out.

41:34.400 --> 41:37.597
By the way, my kids thank you
from the bottom of their hearts

41:37.640 --> 41:39.551
for their mattresses.

41:39.600 --> 41:42.478
Now doesn't that make you feel good?

41:45.080 --> 41:46.593
You know this kid?

41:49.600 --> 41:53.115
- Yep. He was in here.
- When?

41:53.160 --> 41:55.958
Boy was in here Friday.
He had one drink.

41:56.000 --> 41:59.037
- One drink? Wasn't drunk?
- Nope.

41:59.080 --> 42:02.436
- He was rude.
- Yeah.

42:03.960 --> 42:08.272
'Ooh! I'm just gettin' warmed up.
But it's The Bomb. '

42:08.320 --> 42:10.595
Was he with anybody?

42:10.640 --> 42:14.235
He came in alone.
Might've had a conversation.

42:14.280 --> 42:16.555
Can't recollect.

42:17.440 --> 42:19.795
Do you recollect the shooting?

42:19.840 --> 42:22.274
Hell, yeah.
Who do you think called the cops?

42:22.320 --> 42:24.356
So that's who you're lookin' for?

42:24.400 --> 42:27.836
Do you remember if the kid was here
before or after the shooting?

42:27.880 --> 42:30.075
He was in here before.
You know how I know?

42:30.120 --> 42:33.669
Cos I was watchin' him.
I never saw him before. He was jumpy.

42:33.720 --> 42:36.712
Thought he might have been
one of those stick-up kids.

42:40.480 --> 42:43.790
This is Strike. Jesus Christ.

42:47.040 --> 42:50.032
They don't look alike to me.

42:50.080 --> 42:51.832
What about him?

42:52.880 --> 42:56.475
Oh, yeah. Victor? A regular.
What's up with him?

43:00.920 --> 43:04.595
Strike, how come you didn't tell me
your brother did it?

43:04.640 --> 43:07.108
Come on, Rodney, man.
What, you forgot?

43:07.160 --> 43:10.709
- You told me you didn't wanna know.
- Yeah, you right.

43:12.360 --> 43:15.193
Victor popped Darryl?.

43:15.240 --> 43:17.674
Hey, I don't know if he even did it.

43:17.720 --> 43:20.280
Victor your brother.
You supposed to know.

43:20.320 --> 43:22.595
Errol, Errol, just...

43:25.920 --> 43:29.151
We ain't had that conversation
about Darryl, did we?

43:29.200 --> 43:30.713
What conversation?

43:30.760 --> 43:33.832
There, you see? Ain't no problem.

43:33.880 --> 43:35.472
Go ahead, man. Break.

43:42.760 --> 43:44.557
That's my boy!

43:45.760 --> 43:49.548
Came in one night only,
on the night of the shooting.

43:49.600 --> 43:53.991
Has the jumps. Never sat down.
Left sober before the shooting.

43:55.000 --> 43:58.276
Yo's jacket shows
possession with intent,

43:58.320 --> 44:00.550
possession of unlicensed firearm,

44:00.600 --> 44:03.717
and assault, for which
he still owes three years.

44:04.720 --> 44:07.598
Listen to me, Rocco.
He's all strung out.

44:07.640 --> 44:09.358
Has a few schnorts over his limit.

44:09.400 --> 44:12.995
He gets fried, walks out of Kool
Breeze with the heater in his bag.

44:13.040 --> 44:15.235
The Adams guy jumps out,
startles him.

44:15.280 --> 44:17.555
Pops the first guy
who steps on his Nikes.

44:17.600 --> 44:19.397
It's like a capper on a bad day.

44:19.440 --> 44:23.194
That's how these Nubians do it. He
gets religion, comes in, gives it up.

44:23.240 --> 44:25.276
I'm not wasting my time on this.

44:25.320 --> 44:29.154
Come on, Larry. Can't you see
what they're tryin' to pull?.

44:29.200 --> 44:32.476
Larry. Yo walks in,
says he's the shooter.

44:32.520 --> 44:35.318
No record,
two adorable kids, two jobs.

44:35.360 --> 44:37.669
Model citizen. Claims self-defence.

44:37.720 --> 44:40.439
- OK. All right.
- Who's gonna argue?

44:40.480 --> 44:43.756
Now, this other one... Strike.

44:43.800 --> 44:47.759
If he tried that, they'd throw
the key away. He's a known scumbag.

44:47.800 --> 44:50.951
No wonder this sounds like horseshit.
He's lying.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.911
Victor never got off that bar stool.

44:52.960 --> 44:55.554
- Yo was taken away for his brother.
- For what?

44:55.600 --> 44:58.592
Brotherly love?
Fear? For money? What?

44:58.640 --> 45:00.949
They ran a game on me, these two,

45:01.000 --> 45:03.514
cos this cocksucker
is an innocent man.

45:03.560 --> 45:06.233
Just because a Nubian -
excuse me, Lieutenant -

45:06.280 --> 45:09.272
got a wife, a job, kids,
a dog and a bank account,

45:09.320 --> 45:10.719
he can't be a shooter?

45:10.760 --> 45:13.752
You did everything but stick
your tongue down his throat.

45:13.800 --> 45:16.519
The kid didn't budge.
Rocco, listen to me.

45:16.560 --> 45:20.235
Even if this Victor kid is sellin' us
a line of shit on the tape...

45:20.280 --> 45:24.034
which is what they all do anyhow,
even if they're givin' it up...

45:24.080 --> 45:27.356
this is still a good,
solid "closed by arrest".

45:27.400 --> 45:31.029
And if I'm wrong, and Rodney
conspired in on this, or Strike...

45:31.080 --> 45:35.312
or the fuckin' Medellín cartel,
I don't give a fuck.

45:35.360 --> 45:36.839
Cos we got the shooter.

45:38.440 --> 45:40.874
We locked up the wrong brother.

45:40.920 --> 45:44.799
The wrong brother. Yeah. Yeah.
Well, it's on you, OK?

45:47.160 --> 45:51.358
What I want to know is where the fuck
did these yos get balls big enough

45:51.400 --> 45:53.960
to think that they could
put this one past me?

45:54.000 --> 45:58.232
I'm tired of hearin' that "yo" shit
from you. Back off.

45:58.280 --> 46:00.350
I'm sorry, Lieutenant. Excuse me.
I don't mean any offence.

46:02.960 --> 46:05.428
Anybody can bust off an oowop.
What makes Vic any different?

46:05.480 --> 46:07.675
Come on, man.
Papers say he had a.38.

46:07.720 --> 46:10.951
- Regardless what the papers say.
- Wait, motherfucker.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.958
When was the last time
you bust off an oowop?

46:14.000 --> 46:17.959
I never murdered nobody,
but I'm gonna murder someone now!

46:18.000 --> 46:22.118
Yo, yo, chill. Hold it, man. Kill
that noise. Homo-cide creepin' up.

46:22.160 --> 46:24.037
How you doin', fellas?

46:25.080 --> 46:27.799
Look who's here.
Ronnie Dunham, big man.

46:27.840 --> 46:31.071
- Ronnie?
- Can I talk to you a minute?

46:33.280 --> 46:35.111
Go on, bitch.

46:36.960 --> 46:39.599
I'm Rocco Klein,
DA's Homicide Squad.

46:40.360 --> 46:42.476
- You got a minute?
- Homo-cide.

46:42.520 --> 46:46.229
I'm doin' the Darryl Adams job.
Your brother, you know?

46:46.280 --> 46:47.679
How's he doin'?

46:47.720 --> 46:50.280
Wouldn't know. Haven't seen him yet.

46:51.360 --> 46:54.830
That's no joke in there.
You been in?

46:56.000 --> 46:58.798
Just overnight on a confusion.
Wasn't no thing.

47:03.400 --> 47:06.073
Errol. I thought you were dead.

47:06.120 --> 47:09.078
I was. I came back.

47:09.120 --> 47:11.031
Mr Barnes waiting for you?

47:11.080 --> 47:13.196
Nah, not me.

47:14.840 --> 47:16.796
I'm not happy about this.

47:16.840 --> 47:20.833
Your brother fessed up,
but it was some bullshit explanation.

47:20.880 --> 47:22.916
Ronnie, you know what he told us?

47:22.960 --> 47:25.713
How the fuck would I know?
I wasn't there.

47:25.760 --> 47:30.515
- Wasn't there?
- Where he was telling you all this.

47:30.560 --> 47:32.676
What do you think happened?

47:33.720 --> 47:35.517
Got me.

47:36.120 --> 47:40.033
You think him and Darryl
had some static? A beef?

47:40.080 --> 47:42.833
- Did you know Darryl Adams?
- No, no, no.

47:42.880 --> 47:45.553
- You didn't know Darryl Adams?
- Nah, man.

47:45.600 --> 47:49.195
I never met him, nothin'. Nah.

47:49.240 --> 47:51.959
When's the last time
you saw your brother?

47:52.000 --> 47:54.753
- It's been a while.
- Week, month, year?

47:54.800 --> 47:56.756
- Yeah.
- Which one?

47:56.800 --> 47:58.836
Two months.

47:58.880 --> 48:00.871
Two months?

48:02.480 --> 48:03.879
You wanna get that?

48:03.920 --> 48:07.196
What you talkin'? That ain't mine.

48:07.240 --> 48:09.037
What do you know?

48:09.600 --> 48:12.433
Ronnie, I was lookin' for
some help, some insight.

48:12.480 --> 48:14.948
Your brother's got those kids,
your nephews.

48:15.000 --> 48:16.956
Hey, maybe the guy was a crackhead.

48:17.000 --> 48:20.117
Darryl?. A crackhead?
Crackin' up? Says who?

48:21.440 --> 48:24.910
Ain't nobody sa... It's just...
It's just around, you know.

48:24.960 --> 48:26.996
You know what I'm tryin' to say.

48:27.040 --> 48:29.235
- You clocking?
- Nah.

48:30.240 --> 48:33.835
- How long you been clocking?
- What is you? Deaf? I don't hustle.

48:33.880 --> 48:36.872
Look. Here's my card.

48:36.920 --> 48:40.595
You hear anything...
boom - pick up the phone.

48:40.640 --> 48:43.029
- Boom.
- Good.

48:43.080 --> 48:45.469
I'll be seein' ya around, Ronnie.

48:51.360 --> 48:53.715
Cos I wouldn't do this

48:53.760 --> 48:55.512
Lord, if I tried...

48:58.280 --> 49:02.353
- What he want?
- Somethin' about my brother.

49:07.880 --> 49:09.757
This is from Rodney.

49:11.640 --> 49:14.598
He say whack it up...
into ounces.

49:17.280 --> 49:19.874
He'll hit you off... later.

49:20.800 --> 49:22.950
Yeah, all right.

49:23.960 --> 49:25.313
Hm.

49:30.920 --> 49:32.956
- Jo-Jo. You know Rodney Little?
- Sure.

49:33.000 --> 49:36.675
- Rodney's got this yo, Strike.
- Likes to drink the chocolate Moos.

49:36.720 --> 49:39.951
I need yo to talk to me. You mind
laying some cards on him for me?

49:40.000 --> 49:41.991
- Depends.
- Need him to sweat.

49:42.040 --> 49:45.396
- What'll you do for me?
- Nothin' you don't do for yourself.

49:45.440 --> 49:48.955
Strike, my man!
This is a new day, Strike.

49:49.000 --> 49:53.232
Dinkins out, Rudy in. Law and order.
Cut the budget. Party's over.

49:53.280 --> 49:56.511
Crackdown on drugs, crime, niggers,

49:56.560 --> 50:00.553
spics, homeless, squeegeemen,
African-Americans.

50:00.600 --> 50:03.637
Have a seat. So what's up?

50:03.680 --> 50:05.477
Not a thing, Detective.

50:05.520 --> 50:07.829
Detective? Call me Jo-Jo.

50:07.880 --> 50:10.519
You like basketball?.

50:10.560 --> 50:12.790
Nah. I don't like sports.

50:12.840 --> 50:16.230
- What do you like?
- Trains.

50:16.280 --> 50:20.512
Choo-choo trains?
You can't dunk a basketball?.

50:20.560 --> 50:23.120
- Nah.
- Nah. Get the fuck outta here, man.

50:23.160 --> 50:26.277
You been slammin'
before you was crawlin'.

50:26.320 --> 50:29.232
All right, listen.
I'm here cos I like you.

50:29.280 --> 50:32.158
I do. Now, tomorrow night's
gonna be knocko night.

50:32.200 --> 50:35.476
We're coming down on these projects
like a fuckin' broom.

50:35.520 --> 50:38.671
So if I was you,
I'd take my homies out, say 9pm,

50:38.720 --> 50:41.996
for some chocolate Moolies
or whatever it is you drink,

50:42.040 --> 50:43.837
till about 11, bet?

50:43.880 --> 50:45.313
Yeah, bet.

50:45.360 --> 50:47.828
I look out for you,
you look out for me.

50:47.880 --> 50:50.997
- Yeah, all right.
- No, no, no. No "all right".

50:51.040 --> 50:54.874
I look out for you,
you look out for me.

50:58.280 --> 51:02.159
- You look like 500.
- 500. That's a start.

51:02.200 --> 51:05.112
Good. Every week, I look out for you.

51:05.160 --> 51:09.551
I tell you when we're hittin'. Week
in, week out, you look out for me.

51:09.600 --> 51:11.477
- Cool?.
- Cool.

51:11.520 --> 51:13.590
This is my man Kirby.

51:16.400 --> 51:19.676
Kirby gonna double back in
like 30 minutes. You lay it on him.

51:19.720 --> 51:24.236
You tell your boy Rodney
I got some good stuff he could use.

51:24.280 --> 51:26.953
Finest, highest quality.

51:28.960 --> 51:30.951
Peace out.

51:40.760 --> 51:42.637
I think you dropped this.

51:42.680 --> 51:45.319
If I was you,
I think I'd call this guy.

51:46.280 --> 51:47.793
Larry.

51:48.360 --> 51:50.032
Yo, Strike.

52:03.400 --> 52:07.632
- Been waiting for 40 minutes...
- Who's here to see Victor Dunham?

52:11.400 --> 52:14.790
You told me he was gonna
come down a half-hour ago.

52:14.840 --> 52:17.559
Watch your tone,
young lady.

52:30.960 --> 52:33.394
Aw, man. I love you. I love you, man.

52:33.440 --> 52:35.795
- Cool, man.
- You look good.

52:39.640 --> 52:41.437
After you, man.

52:46.120 --> 52:48.156
Somebody got bored shaving.

52:49.200 --> 52:51.919
So they decided
to cut me up with a razor.

52:56.840 --> 52:59.195
And they stole my sneakers, too.

53:00.480 --> 53:02.072
Yo, big brother.

53:04.120 --> 53:06.315
You made the papers, man.

53:15.160 --> 53:19.995
Ronnie...
Can you get me outta here, man?

53:20.040 --> 53:23.715
- I'll try. What's the bail?.
- 50,000.

53:23.760 --> 53:26.228
50?! God damn!

53:27.160 --> 53:30.391
- What's the cash options?
- My lawyer says maybe in a week...

53:30.440 --> 53:33.716
I can get that, um,
that ten per cent thing.

53:33.760 --> 53:35.512
- Maybe Rodney got...
- Rodney?

53:35.560 --> 53:38.632
Tell motherfuckers
to stop fuckin' with you.

53:38.680 --> 53:41.877
Yeah, man.
Yeah. Yeah. Maybe.

53:44.280 --> 53:47.238
Look, man, I'm gonna try
to get you outta here, OK?

53:47.280 --> 53:51.671
Ronnie, some of these brothers...
some of these men...

53:52.280 --> 53:54.396
they love jail, man.

53:54.440 --> 53:57.716
But all this, this ain't for me, man.

53:58.680 --> 54:01.148
I'm gonna get you
outta here, all right?

54:07.840 --> 54:10.115
You kiss my babies for me, please?

54:11.160 --> 54:14.755
- All right.
- Thank you.

54:19.040 --> 54:21.679
We've been open
for about a year.

54:22.560 --> 54:25.313
We've done pretty well so far.

54:28.240 --> 54:30.993
When I read about it,
my heart was broken.

54:31.040 --> 54:32.712
Victor is a sweetheart.

54:32.760 --> 54:35.832
- Was he ever late for work?
- Never. Like Swiss movement.

54:35.880 --> 54:38.314
- Did he ever steal?.
- No, he was honest.

54:38.360 --> 54:40.954
- Get any visitors?
- No.

54:43.800 --> 54:45.677
See him in here?

54:45.720 --> 54:47.119
No.

54:47.160 --> 54:50.914
Victor was my buffer.
He could talk and reason with them.

54:50.960 --> 54:53.758
Anybody ever threaten him?

54:53.800 --> 54:56.030
Open up your eyes
and realise things is tough

54:56.080 --> 54:58.958
Your shit is my rough
when you livin' in the city

54:59.000 --> 55:01.309
Walk with your head high
step with the bitty-bop

55:01.360 --> 55:04.033
Got to survive
when you slam or you do or die

55:04.080 --> 55:06.548
Cos niggers try to read through
a nigger's eyes...

55:06.600 --> 55:08.875
- May I help you?
- Huh?

55:08.920 --> 55:11.912
- May I help you?
- Yeah, let me the fuck in the store.

55:11.960 --> 55:15.111
This is a store, right?
People buy shit in the store.

55:15.160 --> 55:18.596
- What do you wish to buy, brother?
- I wish to buy what you got.

55:20.200 --> 55:22.156
Maybe we don't have what you want.

55:22.200 --> 55:25.351
Unbelievable. What are you,
the security house nigger?

55:25.400 --> 55:28.710
- What? They rent you by the hour?
- We're just trying to help...

55:28.760 --> 55:29.954
Fuck that, man!

55:30.000 --> 55:33.709
Cos I'm black, that automatically
mean I'm gonna steal something.

55:33.760 --> 55:36.957
Nigger, I came in here

55:37.000 --> 55:38.513

Chinese bitch store!

55:43.360 --> 55:45.351
Fuck you, motherfucker!

55:45.400 --> 55:48.472
I'm gonna bring my steel
and pump bullets in your ass.

55:48.520 --> 55:49.714
Think I'm playing?

55:49.760 --> 55:52.911
You disrespectin' me

55:52.960 --> 55:55.428
Listen up, man.

55:55.480 --> 55:57.152
How much you make in a month?

55:57.200 --> 56:01.751
See this? See this?
It's a hundred dollar bill, right?

56:03.520 --> 56:05.750
Use it in your kid's birthday.

56:05.800 --> 56:09.634
I'm gonna come back here.
I'm gonna kill your ass.

56:09.680 --> 56:11.272
Thank you.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.434
I'm gonna kill your ass.

56:16.680 --> 56:20.150
- What did he want?
- Nothin'.

56:22.000 --> 56:26.118
- Did that kid ever come back?
- No.

56:33.080 --> 56:37.039
- Hey, what's up, Mr Brown?
- Hey, Mr Dunham.

56:37.080 --> 56:40.117
Yo, Ty, that's my landlord,
Mr Brown. Say, what's up?

56:40.160 --> 56:42.993
- How you doing, sir?
- Pleased to meet you, young man.

56:43.040 --> 56:45.270
This is Tyrone.
This is my little brother.

56:45.320 --> 56:48.756
Anybody bother you, and his head's
out here, you let me know.

56:48.800 --> 56:51.598
I got something
for the crackheads my damn self.

56:51.640 --> 56:54.837
You do like your big brother.
Leave those drugs alone.

56:54.880 --> 56:57.394
Hey, I got some food on the stove.
See ya later.

56:57.440 --> 57:01.831
All right. Peace.
Now, go up the steps. Hurry up.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.878
Hey, Shorty.
What you doin'? Don't touch that.

57:06.920 --> 57:10.037
Buggin'. You know anything
about what you're touchin'?

57:10.080 --> 57:12.196
No!

57:13.120 --> 57:14.439
Little buster.

57:16.040 --> 57:20.033
Lionel Trains, right?
They was built in the early 1900s.

57:20.080 --> 57:23.993
But them cheap shits,
they only ran on dry cell batteries.

57:24.040 --> 57:26.998
But, yo, after World War II,

57:27.040 --> 57:31.192
when more folks started getting
electricity in their cribs,

57:31.240 --> 57:33.959
boom, they made the new ones.

57:34.000 --> 57:37.117
Yeah, phat, right?
Yeah.

57:37.160 --> 57:41.551
Yo, profit's all in the cut.
Don't never forget that.

57:43.360 --> 57:46.955
Yo, Shorty, if I ever see
or even hear about you

57:47.000 --> 57:51.357
messin' with this stuff right here,
man, sniffin' or pipin' up...

57:51.400 --> 57:54.312
Yo, come here, man.

57:54.360 --> 57:56.112
The word to my mother.

58:00.640 --> 58:02.471
Put a cap in your ass.

58:02.520 --> 58:05.398
This ain't no TV movie
violence bullshit neither.

58:05.440 --> 58:07.158
This stuff out here is real.

58:07.200 --> 58:10.317
Real bullets hurt.
And real guns kills you dead.

58:10.360 --> 58:13.989
See this right here?
This is.25 automatic.

58:15.360 --> 58:18.670
I keeps this for all them
ill niggers out there.

58:18.720 --> 58:22.030
Like that one dude Errol.
Now that brother's crazy.

58:22.080 --> 58:24.878
He will blast your ass,
just won't give a fuck.

58:24.920 --> 58:27.832
The messed-up thing is
that they never find the body.

58:27.880 --> 58:29.836
Just the blood stains on the ground.

58:29.880 --> 58:32.952
If he ever try to creep up on me,
I'm gonna gat his ass.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.150
You best be ready
to do the same shit, too.

58:35.200 --> 58:38.033
Aw, don't think
that just cos you're 12,

58:38.080 --> 58:41.550
small and shit,
that he won't smoke you.

58:41.600 --> 58:44.353
Just last year,
he caught himself a ten-year-old.

58:44.400 --> 58:48.154
I knows you probably thinking about
what Mr Brown said earlier and all.

58:48.200 --> 58:50.714
But, chill, don't even
sweat that shit, man.

58:50.760 --> 58:53.593
He's old and po'.
He don't know what time it is.

58:53.640 --> 58:55.790
This is how you get
that money right here.

58:55.840 --> 58:58.513
How do you think I got
that phat-ass train set?

58:58.560 --> 59:00.755
From pumpin'
this white shit right here.

59:00.800 --> 59:03.598
Any fly shit you want
in this world, it costs money.

59:03.640 --> 59:08.873
And this is how you get it. Hustling.
Don't never forget that shit neither.

59:12.080 --> 59:16.198
Yo, Shorty, you're smart, right?
Well, answer me this.

59:17.160 --> 59:20.516
Boss buys him a key
for $22,000, right?

59:20.560 --> 59:23.791
Cuts it up to 3,500 $10 bottles.

59:23.840 --> 59:29.472
Boss takes 60%, $17,000 profit,
leaving up $7,000,

59:29.520 --> 59:31.511
50% of which is mine.

59:32.680 --> 59:34.671
How much for me?

59:38.880 --> 59:40.632
3,500.

59:40.680 --> 59:43.399
My man, Shorty.
Keep hittin' them books, all right?

59:43.440 --> 59:44.668
All right.

59:44.720 --> 59:48.315
If I ever catch you playing hooky,
I'll put a cap in your ass.

59:48.360 --> 59:51.796
My name is M-O
and don't you forget it

59:51.840 --> 59:54.991
Takin' out your boys
and you don't know how I did it

59:55.040 --> 59:57.600
Pickin' off your crew one by one

59:57.640 --> 01:00:01.030
Don't step in my way
cos I just might have a gun

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:04.038
May be loaded just might not be

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:06.435
Cos I'm a menace to society

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:09.517
My name not Thiggy-thiggy
but I still get hip

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:12.711
- So back the fuck up and just
- Chill

01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:15.513
Cos steppin' on me
you'll be a-writin' your will

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:18.358
I'm like an Energizer
can't never die

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:21.676
Ba, ba, ba, ba, nice try

01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:24.678
Ha, ha, ha,
I saw you run in the building

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:27.632
Throwing up my guns
to the ceiling

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:30.353
Ba, ba, ba, here I go again

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:33.039
Ba, ba, ba, cops are comin' in

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:35.674
Run into the back, man
I'm fast up the staircase

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:37.199
I got no time to waste

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:40.312
Nobody seen my face
so I leave without a trace...

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:46.833
Make the drops over on Smith Street
from now on.

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:48.518
Yeah, all right.

01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:51.233
Oh, yeah, crooked-ass Jo-Jo.

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:53.714
He said he got
some weight for you to buy.

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:56.035
Forget that motherfucker.

01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:59.675
Fuckin' faggot.
He tapped me up for $500, too.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.993
Errol told me you talked
to the homicide cop.

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:11.314
- How'd that go?
- It was aight.

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:15.511
"Aight" or all right?

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:19.556
It was "aight," all right?

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:30.232
I ever tell you about
the first time I killed somebody?

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:31.349
Nah.

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:33.311
Errol Barnes made me do it...

01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:36.713
cos it was three guys burned us
on some bogus dope.

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:42.234
'Errol's already killed
the other two, right?

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:43.508
'We got the third guy. '

01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:47.030
Be cool, man.
Chill, motherfucker, chill.

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:49.116
Ain't you all sorry
you fucked with us?

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:50.434
I ain't fucked with you.

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:53.552
You're lucky we don't blow your ass
off like them crackers down South.

01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:56.751
- Look, I hate this shit, man.
- What the fuck is my name?

01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:59.268
- Errol, man.
- You're goddam right.

01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:01.470
'Motherfucker
crying like a baby.

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:03.875
'Tears, snot flying, and shit.
Errol turned to me. '

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:08.357
Says, "You got
to cap him, or I'm gonna cap you. "

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:11.551
Man, come on, that shit
ain't necessary, man.

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:15.036
'I ain't gonna cap that boy.
He's scared like a motherfucker. '

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:18.356
You think I'm playin' with you?
Open your mouth.

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:20.231
You gonna take this piece...

01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:23.158
and you're gonna put that
motherfucker's brains out.

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:26.670
- You understand me?!
- I got it.

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:30.279
Go to it.

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:32.595
I said you shouldn't
have did that shit, man.

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:36.394
- Come on, please! Please!
- On three, Rodney.

01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:38.829
I can't stop my hand from shakin'.

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:42.839
- Don't you chump out on me.
- I can't stop my hand from shakin'!

01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:44.757
- Cap him!
- All right!

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:46.358
Please...

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:52.240
Don't you wish
you'd done us right?

01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:56.558
Hey, hey, hey. Don't you
ever, ever fuck with me, boy.

01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:02.270
Do you know me now? I'm a bad man.

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:05.915
Errol couldn't have me runnin'
around here knowin' what he did

01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:09.111
without somethin' personal
hangin' over my head, too.

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:11.355
Personal, Strike.

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:14.631
Otherwise, I might give him up
someday, you understand?

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:19.919
Strike, that's the reason why

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:23.999
I needed you to be bloody
on this Darryl thing.

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:27.032
You hear me?

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:30.115
'Errol Barnes, boy. '

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:33.596
Motherfucker had a sawed-off
shotgun right in my mug, Strike.

01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:36.552
He's my best friend, too.

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:42.879
- What's the matter with you?
- Shit!

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:48.231
You gotta take care of yourself.

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:51.192
Here. Wipe that off.

01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:54.477
You OK?

01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:58.437
You ain't seen my doctor, have you?

01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:01.517
- Huh?
- Nah.

01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:06.429
Strike, why I got to tell you things
two and three and four times, huh?

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:09.074
Why you don't want to listen to me?

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:11.997
You OK?

01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:16.599
Shit.

01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:20.155
To be honest, I don't really
give a fuck because you lied to me.

01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:24.239
Lied about what? You said Darryl
had a drug problem, a crackhead.

01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:27.033
I asked around. The guy was clean.

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:29.036
I was just speculatin'.

01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:31.389
That's some nasty-ass speculatin'.

01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:37.757
Damn. You're comin'
at me with mad questions.

01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:39.950
I'm just tryin'
to answer them shits.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.072
Then you said you never met 'im.

01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:45.236
Maybe just by eye, all right?

01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:49.319
"Just by eye. "
You and him never had any static?

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:50.952
Naw.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.788
There's no way Victor could've been
cuttin' through the parking lot

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:57.877
in the dark, and Darryl would've
mistaken him for you?

01:04:57.920 --> 01:04:59.558
Naw, man.

01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:01.750
Cos you and your brother,
in the dark,

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:03.870
probably look like two peas in a pod.

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:07.071
What the fuck you sayin'?
All black people look alike at night?

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:10.351
I can't even tell you guys
apart in the day.

01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:12.436
Hey, you got jokes.

01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:15.358
- You and your brother close?
- Not really.

01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:19.109
I forgot. Long-lost brothers.
When was the last time?

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:21.674
A month.

01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:24.359
Strike, you told me
two months before.

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:26.675
If you know so much,
why you keep asking?

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:29.632
- You know what Alzheimer's is?
- Some kind of beer?

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:32.433
Wise guy. You visit him yet?

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:34.713
Yeah.

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:37.431
He's claimin' self-defence.

01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:41.155
He goes to trial with that,
those two nice kids of his,

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:44.272
by the time he'll be gettin'
out, they'll be goin' in.

01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:47.312
Did it ever occur to you
maybe he didn't even do the shit?

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:48.713
You know who did?

01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:51.115
Who did it?

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:53.594
Come on, man, I gotta go. I'm sick.

01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:58.638
- Here's my card.
- Got two already.

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:02.110
You better have that checked out.

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:09.270
Hey, what the fuck y'all lookin' at?

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:12.188
Oh, shit!

01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:14.557
You all right, man?

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.231
Strike! Strike! You smokin' crack,
motherfucker, huh?

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:22.350
Get the fuck up!

01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:27.789
Get an ambulance, man!
Let's get an ambulance!

01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:30.115
Let's get him the hell
outta here.

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:32.833
He'll be all right. He'll be fine.
Watch it, guys.

01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:38.076
One, two, three.
Let's go!

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:41.110
Here you go. It's all right, man.

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:43.958
- Hit that pipe today?
- Dice that shit. He don't use.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.992
Anyone ever tell you not to do drugs?
Where do you live?

01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:49.873
I'll give you that.
Just get him to hospital.

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:52.912
Welcome to Ahab's.
May I take your order, please?

01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:55.394
Yes,
we need a Double Whaler on a bun.

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:57.510
'With cheese?'

01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:00.870
Yes, with cheese.
A fried shrimp boat.

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:02.433
'One fried shrimp boat. '

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:03.629
- Two.
- Yeah, two.

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:05.033
'Two fried shrimp... '

01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:11.868
Uh, could I please get my
Captain Ahab with a clam roll?.

01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:14.434
- Captain Ahab, Captain...
- What's up, boys?

01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:17.472
Hey, it's a nice car you got.

01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:20.353
- Yeah, it's my dad's car.
- How ya doin'?

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:22.630
Power windows,
air bags, cellular phone.

01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:25.240
Bet he paid a pretty penny for this.

01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:28.477
Oh, yeah. We were lookin'
for the Short Hills Mall.

01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:30.511
- It's not here.
- No?

01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:33.393
Come down from Connecticut
just to buy some whiting?

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:35.476
Some golf balls.

01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:38.318
You buy anything else around here
I should know about?

01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:40.237
- Some gum.
- No.

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:42.589
You like soul food?

01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:44.631
Can't say I do.

01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:48.036
- You like to wear lipstick?
- Todd, why don't we get outta here?

01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:50.640
McCauley does
in the back... occasionally.

01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:53.353
- You like skirts?
- Something we did wrong?

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:56.198
- You ever suck a black man's dick?
- Let's get outta here!

01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:59.437
A big, 16-inch tar baby?

01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:01.550
- No?
- No.

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:04.990
If I toss this car and I find any
drugs, I got 12 baboons in a cage

01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:07.952
who are gonna be callin'
you boys Mary all night.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.718
- Come on, Todd.
- Shut up, man!

01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:12.354
- Who's got the drugs?
- We don't have anything.

01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:14.675
- You got five seconds.
- Todd's got the drugs!

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:17.598
- Shut up, man!
- Todd's got the drugs.

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:20.154
- Fuck you guys, man!
- Put your hands on the car.

01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:22.316
- Take it easy!
- Fucking cocksucker!

01:08:22.359 --> 01:08:25.988
Fucking touch him again, I'll rip
your throat out. Get your hands up.

01:08:40.479 --> 01:08:42.470
- What's up?
- You tell me.

01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:44.511
What you up to, man?

01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:47.393
You the one involved
in all the drama out here.

01:08:47.439 --> 01:08:50.876
How you always know
when I'm comin' out of somewhere?

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:54.037
Don't you know I know everything?

01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:56.389
Didn't I tell you
to go see my doctor?

01:08:56.439 --> 01:08:59.238
Didn't I tell you to stop
drinkin' that Moo shit?

01:08:59.279 --> 01:09:02.511
Yeah, you did, you did.
No doubt, man, no doubt.

01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:05.756
- How you so smart and so stupid?
- Cut me some slack.

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:08.872
I heard that Homicide came back
on you again yesterday.

01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:10.956
He ain't sayin' I'm in.
He's just fishin'.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.591
You and him fuck buddies now?

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:16.269
- You got jokes, man.
- Come on, get in, get in.

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:23.716
- How do you feel?.
- I'm all right.

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:27.917
You better be, cos we got
another big order come in.

01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:30.837
Hey, Rod.

01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:38.509
If God created anything better
than crack cocaine,

01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:41.279
he kept that shit for hisself.

01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:45.194
I mean, that shit
is like truth serum.

01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:47.390
It will truly expose who you are.

01:09:47.439 --> 01:09:51.274
I mean, you happen to be
a low-life rat bastard motherfucker,

01:09:51.319 --> 01:09:54.790
who will sell off his newborn
for a suck off that glass dick,

01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:57.195
crack will bring it
right on in the light.

01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:00.277
I don't care you black,
white, Chinese, rich, poor.

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:02.754
You take that first hit,
you on a mission.

01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:05.075
And that mission will never end.

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:08.635
Even when the house,
the money, loved ones are gone,

01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:12.434
they send you to the joint,
you still gonna try to cop.

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:14.277
No doubt.

01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:19.348
Only time it ends, Strike, that
mission, when you six feet under.

01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:23.279
That's the reason I don't ever want
to hear about you using this shit.

01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:26.039
- You understand me?
- You crazy?

01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:27.798
All right, then.

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:32.152
Cos it's also the reason why
I ain't never goin' outta business.

01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:34.714
I'm a great businessman, Strike.

01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:37.797
And I got me the world's
greatest product.

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:41.832
Now you think about that.

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:47.114
Yo, so what up?

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:48.798
I'm gonna see you at the store.

01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:51.035
- Go ahead.
- All right.

01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:57.196
You believe I used to deal with that
woman when she looked like somethin'?

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:01.270
Yeah. You didn't know that, did you?

01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:03.072
She used to look good, right?

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:06.430
She looked better than she look now.

01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:18.192
- Finest shit we got today.
- Let me see.

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:21.312
- Yeah.
- 50 dollars.

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:23.999
But ain't y'all pregnant,
though, y'all?.

01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:26.838
- You got to maintain that, man.
- We already know that.

01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:29.235
That's the last
I'm gonna sell to y'all.

01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:31.669
Y'all got to take care
of that little girl.

01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:39.953
Got red caps?

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.275
I'm getting tired
of these nickels, man.

01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:45.437
Where the dimes at, Lou?
We don't got it like that.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.072
Come on, let's do this.

01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:55.111
You got it?

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:20.678
I got reds and I got yellows.

01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:22.790
- What you need?
- Two yellow ones.

01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:24.831
- Want two yellows?
- I want two reds.

01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:28.350
All right, Veronica. Slow down, girl.
Why you in such a hurry?

01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:31.790
- Because I wanna get out of here.
- Wanna get outta here?

01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:35.029
- Let me see this money.
- No, I said two.

01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:37.594
- Let me see the money. Chill.
- I want yellow.

01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:39.551
- You want yellows?
- I want reds.

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:42.637
It's the same shit. Both
of 'em just to crack your ass up.

01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:45.194
- I want three of 'em.
- And I said two.

01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:02.036
You notice the tablecloths out there,
with the African prints?

01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:05.516
The nice carpeting and the plants
hanging from the ceilings?

01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:07.994
It's all Victor's ideas.

01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:13.034
You see, Victor always wanted to make
this place like somebody's home.

01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:15.469
He treated everybody with respect.

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:19.274
The workers, the customers...
even the clockers.

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:22.994
Like, you asked me
about last Friday night.

01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:25.315
'We got three
cocolo chocho face maricones

01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:28.557
'trying to set up shop out there,
right in front of my business. '

01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:33.720
I reach for my... trusty Roberto
Clemente Louisville Slugger here,

01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:37.275
and I'm ready to bash in a head,
I'm ready to bash in an arm.

01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:39.072
But Victor, Victor, he says...

01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:42.635
No, Jesus, no.
Let me handle them, please.

01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:46.997
We set somebody up
in the bathroom there.

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:50.077
Put somebody over there
as a lookout in the window.

01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:52.554
Sorry, but you brothers
can't clock in here.

01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:55.956
This is a family place,
and I need you to respect that.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.879
Here. Take these jumbo sodas.
This is a Pepsi.

01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:04.189
An orange. A root beer.

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:08.550
I would appreciate it very much...

01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:11.797
if you would leave when
you finish your jumbo sodas.

01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:15.469
Usually they would just be happy
to get the free jumbo sodas,

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:19.638
but on this night, Leroy pulls out
a roll this big and says...

01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:25.516
My boss says that he'll pay you $300
a week if you let us set up here.

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:29.993
What did he say?

01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:35.239
Victor puts please and thank you into
every sentence. So, it was either...

01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:36.872
No. Please, thank you.

01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:39.832
- Or...
- Please. No, thank you.

01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:43.031
What? You tryin' to be fuckin'
burger boy of the month, man?

01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:47.914
Wait. Your girlfriend likes you
smellin' like burgers?

01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:49.393
No. My wife...

01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:54.070
Oh, your wife, your wife.
Got it. I see, OK, look.

01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:56.350
We're tryin' to do something here.

01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:57.515
I can respect that.

01:14:57.560 --> 01:15:00.836
You take your business outside,
and I'll handle my business inside.

01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:04.589
You can't even smile, man. You don't
like this job. Feel that money.

01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:08.474
- It's power.
- I need you to respect that.

01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:13.597
I'm gonna miss you, man.

01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:16.757
So, I have to check the floor.
I got a business to run.

01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:20.236
- So, Hay-sus...
- I pronounce it "Jesus".

01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:22.748
I feel more comfortable
calling you "Hay-sus".

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:26.429
My mother called me Jesus, my father
called me Jesus. You call me Jesus.

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:30.029
All right, Jesus. So is that why
Victor left early Friday?

01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:31.832
He said he wasn't feeling well.

01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:37.398
- Fuck. I gotta make a call.
- There's a phone out in front.

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:39.158
Wasn't feeling well?.

01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:43.034
Would you feel well after working
65 hours a week in a place like this?

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:45.958
It'll make you sick. Try it. Give me
your badge, I'll give you my apron.

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:49.549
How much cheese
you make yesterday, yo?

01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:52.558
I made like a motherfuckin' yard.
I did all right.

01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:55.034
- Yo, Strike!
- Here comes Shorty.

01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:57.071
- Take this.
- Shorty, what I told you?

01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:58.314
It's yours.

01:15:58.360 --> 01:15:59.918
I told you!

01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:01.757
- Here comes your moms.
- Oh, shit.

01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:03.677
- It's yours.
- You crazy?

01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:06.951
- What did I say? Huh? You hear me?
- What are you doin'?

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.788
You hear me? I told you!
You leave my son alone!

01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:13.877
Don't you ever put your motherfuckin'
hands in my face.

01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:16.673
I will put my hands
wherever I want to!

01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:18.676
You stop buying him shit.

01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:20.631
I ain't buyin' him shit.

01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:24.194
- Fuck!
- Go home. Go!

01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:27.596
The Nikes,
the Sega game, the haircut!

01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:30.276
You thought you were slick, right?

01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:33.517
I saw him riding the bike.
You wouldn't let him bring that home.

01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:36.233
You best stay the fuck
out of my face.

01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:40.637
I am not scared of you.
Maybe you're scared of Andre.

01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:42.511
You get Andre. I don't give a fuck.

01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:47.031
You are sellin'
your own people death.

01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:50.876
All of y'all. I'm not gonna let you
take him with you.

01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:53.195
You hear me?
I can't let you do that.

01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:55.754
I can't let you do that.

01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:59.234
Can't! You understand?

01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:01.396
I'm gonna go get Andre.

01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:05.870
She took a pop at him, the ho.

01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:09.430
Yeah, here come your friend, man.

01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:12.278
Now you're beatin' up
on defenceless women?

01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:15.517
- What gives?
- Come on, man. She attacked me.

01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:18.949
Can I talk to you a minute?
Have a seat.

01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:24.550
Don't look so depressed.
Worse things could happen.

01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:33.919
Hey, Ronnie, have I treated you
like a hard-on out here?

01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:35.473
What?

01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:37.715
Have I not treated you
like a man out here?

01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:40.513
Talked to you
with respect, courtesy, huh?

01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:42.232
What you talkin' about?

01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:44.475
Why you tryin' to make
a fuckin' fool outta me?

01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:47.353
- What you talkin' about?
- What am I talkin' about?

01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:49.516
You told me you
didn't know Darryl Adams.

01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:53.269
I'm running around like
a horse's ass on that.

01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:55.595
Not only did I find out
that you know him,

01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:58.518
but you worked a year with him
at Rodney's store.

01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:00.391
Why the fuck didn't you tell me?

01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:02.795
I thought you meant
this other Darryl.

01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:04.353
What other Darryl?.

01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:05.992
If you knew some other Darryl,

01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:08.679
you should have said,
"Yeah, I know him," right?

01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:11.712
- I don't get it.
- I only know one Darryl.

01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:14.672
You said you didn't see
your brother in two months.

01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:16.358
- Oh, God.
- You got all kind...

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:19.233
What? Ronnie, don't "Oh, God" me.

01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:22.670
You got all kinds of pissed off
at me just like you are now,

01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:25.757
- cos I forgot you said that, right?
- Yeah.

01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:27.472
Well, guess what?

01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:29.078
I go into the Kool Breeze,

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:32.430
the bar your brother was in
just before the shootin',

01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:36.029
the bartender ID'd you
in there that night.

01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:38.719
He even remembered the drink
he made for you.

01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:42.673
Pina colada, straight out of a can.
Does this ring a bell?.

01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:45.237
Why did you lie to me?

01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:48.352
- Cos man, it's my brother.
- What's your brother?

01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:50.038
Your brother made you lie?

01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:51.957
Tryin' to look out for him.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.560
Explain to me how lyin' helps him.
He's locked up.

01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:56.955
What you sayin'?
You tryin' to pin this on me?

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:58.752
I didn't say that. You said that.

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:02.156
I asked you why you throwin' me
a line of shit. Why did you say that?

01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:05.795
Oh, man.
See, you fuckin' with my words.

01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:08.957
You confusin' me.
Twistin' my shits around.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:12.675
Me? Oh, who's twistin' who
here, Ronnie?

01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:16.952
All's I'm askin' is why did you
try to play me like a jerk?

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.798
- Please, stop fuckin' with me.
- What's in it for you?

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:22.877
What the fuck is this?
20 questions or somethin'?

01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:25.718
We already spoke about this shit.

01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:28.479
Hey, Ronnie! I just want to know
what you know.

01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:30.238
Am I under arrest?

01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:33.750
Fuck, no! If I arrest you,
I can't talk to you.

01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:35.995
Then the conversation's over.

01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:38.918
Fine. You don't have to do shit.

01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:41.349
But if you wanna continue
to do business here,

01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:46.155
without Jo-Jo and his crew puttin'
their hands in your pockets,

01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:48.714
I would think about
takin' a ride right now.

01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:50.557
What the fuck I look like?

01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:53.717
I ain't goin' nowhere
with your homo-cide ass.

01:19:57.200 --> 01:19:58.519
Look.

01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:01.153
Shit.

01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:05.317
Are you comin' or what?

01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:18.197
How you doin'?

01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:22.434
Man, you crazy, man?
I ain't goin' up in there.

01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:24.357
No?

01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:37.071
Yo, Rocco. Yeah, yeah, come on, come
on, man. I ain't got nothin' to say.

01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:40.112
I was prayin'
you could help me out here.

01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:41.718
Because to tell you the truth,

01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:44.718
I've come completely around
to your way of thinking.

01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:49.788
- What's my way of thinkin'?
- I know your brother is innocent.

01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:53.196
If Victor was my brother
and I knew what you know,

01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:56.516
every day of my life
would be a living hell.

01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:00.229
You think we can do something
about this?

01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:02.669
- About what?
- All bullshit aside.

01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:05.518
You, me, Victor, we all know
who did Darryl Adams.

01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:07.789
Who?

01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:09.831
Who do you think?

01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:11.950
I don't know. You tell me.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.115
You!

01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:14.991
- Me?
- You little fuck. You did it.

01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:17.031
I know it, you know it!

01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:18.957
- Your brother knows it.
- Shit.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:23.039
What's the thinkin' on this,
that if Victor claims self-defence,

01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:25.469
he'll get off
because he has no record?

01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:27.476
His life is over!

01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:30.114
I know it's rough out here
for young, black males

01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:32.958
with racism, no jobs,
single parent families...

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.195
- Fuck that.
- Don't fuckin' gesture at me.

01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:36.719
Have some fuckin' respect.

01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:39.957
But you're the fuckin' king snake!

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:43.276
You're a low-down, cold-blooded,
evil junkyard nigger...

01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:46.437
- .. like I've never seen in my life.
- What you talkin' about?

01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:48.710
What'd you do, offer him money?

01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:51.672
Who the fuck are you kiddin'?
You're not the Mafia.

01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:55.759
You're not even Rodney Little! You're
a skinny-ass snake motherfucker.

01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:59.509
You think you're hot shit. You ain't
nothing but a cold, fucking fart.

01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:02.279
You don't know a motherfuckin' thing
about me.

01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:04.834
You just a racist-ass,
nigger-hating cop.

01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:07.155
You don't know how it is
for brothers.

01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:09.191
And you motherfuckin' definitely...

01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:12.118
- Don't point...
- .. nothin' about what's goin' on.

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:14.549
Don't you fuckin' point
your finger at me.

01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:17.160
What's goin' on? What don't I see?

01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:20.033
I ain't tellin' you shit
till I see my lawyer.

01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:21.479
Listen. I talked to...

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:23.556
Look at me.
I got something nice to say.

01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:27.639
I talked to all your brother's
people. He's one of the decent ones.

01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:31.719
Probably in his deluded decency,
he thinks he's doing a noble thing.

01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:35.753
But you and Victor playin' me
for a patsy? Usin' me?

01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:37.358
Back up with that shit.

01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:40.517
I read you like a Marvel fuckin'
Spiderman comic book!

01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:43.677
I been inside your bald pea brain
since you were born.

01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:45.995
20 fuckin' years!

01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:48.235
You don't play me, I play you!

01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:52.517
Fuck!

01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:57.238
Rocco, you can't do this
in front of our house.

01:22:57.280 --> 01:22:59.236
Understand? It's no good.

01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:03.117
Strike.

01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:09.315
You want to make yourself crazy
goin' after someone else on this?

01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:11.510
There's your man, right over there.

01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:13.596
Hold on.

01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:17.438
Man, get your little ass in the car.

01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:20.916
Fuck Rodney. Yo thinks
he's gonna okey-doke me.

01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:24.077
He's goin' down, Larry.
Down for the fuckin' count.

01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:25.314
Take it easy.

01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:28.432
- How ya doin'?
- Fuck you, too, Rodney.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:34.152
- Come on. Hey! Take it easy.
- I'm gonna cripple that cocksucker.

01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:35.758
I swear on my mother's grave,
I'm gonna cripple him.

01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:40.032
You were supposed to be
at my spot an hour ago.

01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:43.959
What am I supposed to do?
Tell Homicide I can't talk now?

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.356
I gotta go bag up some ounces
for my boss, Rodney Little?

01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:49.868
- He arrest you?
- Nah.

01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:52.639
Why didn't you tell him
to go fuck hisself?

01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:56.751
Well, what did he want?

01:23:56.800 --> 01:24:00.031
Nothin' much.
You know, same old, same old.

01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:03.518
- He ask about me?
- Nah.

01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:07.711
- Huh?
- Nah. Damn.

01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:11.116
Cos I never said nothin' to you
about shootin' nobody.

01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:14.550
All's I said, you want Darryl's spot,
you got to get it for yourself.

01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:17.831
- Shit, I didn't even say that.
- Fuck you, Rodney.

01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:27.871
Excuse me. Who the fuck are you
talkin' to like that?

01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:30.593
You outta your motherfuckin'
mind, hmm?

01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:35.591
You think I'm one of them little crew
niggers sittin' on a project bench?

01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:39.751
Open your mouth, nigger.
You feel that?

01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:43.831
I put this gun in your bad breath
smellin' mouth,

01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:45.472
I will pull the trigger.

01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:47.988
I'll splatter
what little brains you got

01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:51.157
all over the Corinthian
leather interior of my car.

01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:54.510
This is my wife's brand-new car,
so you know I don't give a fuck.

01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:56.516
- You understand?
- Yeah.

01:24:56.560 --> 01:25:00.075
- Do you understand me, bitch?
- Yeah!

01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:02.076
Let me tell you somethin' else.

01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:07.278
If I ever hear about you talkin' to
that Homicide one more time,

01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:10.630
that Rocco, I don't care
if he asks you the time of day,

01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:12.557
if I hear about my name comin' up,

01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:15.910
I'm gonna know it was you
and I'm gonna kill ya.

01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:19.475
I mean, you are 1-87
on the street, understand?

01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:22.512
- Do you understand me?
- Yeah.

01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:24.551
Word is bond.

01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:28.388
Now get your motherfuckin'
ass outta my car.

01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:30.476
Who bought you this shit?

01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:32.909
Strike bought you that shit?

01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:35.554
Where your mama at?
She know you out here?

01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:36.794
When I was a little boy,

01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:39.673
my daddy would have kicked my butt
all over this street.

01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:42.598
- I don't have a father, all right?
- You got one now.

01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:45.359
When Errol is talkin' to you,
you listen.

01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:48.676
- You're not my daddy.
- I'm your daddy now.

01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:49.914
You get your butt...

01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:52.474
You little motherfuckers,
get outta here!

01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:55.478
Hey, look here.
Now I got to deal with this.

01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:57.511
Look at this.

01:25:57.560 --> 01:25:59.357
Shit.

01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:01.789
What the fuck is he doin'?

01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:07.273
I'm a bad man.
Errol!

01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:09.311
Get your hand off me.

01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:15.318
- What are you doin', man?
- Get the fuck outta here.

01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:17.191
Errol, come here.

01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:24.391
Step off.

01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:39.150
Hey, Shorty.
Now, fun and games is over.

01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:41.668
I warned your ass
about Errol, didn't I?

01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:44.473
- Huh? Didn't I?
- What's goin' on here?

01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:47.193
I don't want to see your ass
hangin' around me no more.

01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:49.435
- What'd I do?
- Now take your ass home.

01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:51.755
I don't want to see
your ass no more!

01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:54.519
You a little nigger.
This is real nigger shit.

01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:57.552
You need to be in school.
Get your ass up...

01:26:57.600 --> 01:26:59.875
- I thought I was def!
- Shut the fuck up!

01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:01.911
Take your ass home to your moms.

01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:05.157
Get the fuck up them steps.
Hurry up, man!

01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:10.394
- Hurry the fuck up!
- Shouldn't have taught me then.

01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:12.992
Punk.

01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:21.516
I busted these
four yuppie dickheads over at Ahab's.

01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:23.869
They drove down
in Daddy's Benz to cop.

01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:25.558
So fuckin' what?

01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:28.990
I'm gonna use them to pinch that
motherfucking shinehead Rodney.

01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:31.235
I got 'im set up.

01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:33.837
You got Rodney set up?

01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:36.633
Got that fuckin' yo
set up just like the movie.

01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:41.311
Let me do a favour for ya.

01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:44.079
Me and Mazilli know the prick.
Let us pick him up.

01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:45.599
You'd owe me two favours.

01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:48.632
You ain't gonna let me forget.
I ain't worried.

01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:51.069
No, I won't.

01:27:55.680 --> 01:28:00.435
I wash my face in dirty water

01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:08.840
Cos it gives my mind a little order

01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:16.670
And I play that game
just like I should do

01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:24.471
But my whole world slips away

01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:32.995
I live my life, I live it slowly

01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:40.556
And I take my time, I'm in no hurry

01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:43.273
Yeah, I'm livin'

01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:48.517
And when I go
then I would surely...

01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:53.960
Hey, Mr Mazilli.

01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:58.159
Klein. What you need, man?

01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:01.351
- I need you, brother.
- Oh, yeah?

01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:04.790
- For what?
- I got me a warrant on ya.

01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:07.673
- Warrant for what?
- Arrest.

01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:12.076
You want to arrest me?
For what, Mazilli?

01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:14.588
You must have sold
to an undercover, man.

01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:15.914
Oh, man, please!

01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:18.474
You so desperate
you sellin' shit yourself?

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:19.919
Excuse me.

01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:21.837
All right.

01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:24.678
- Who tryin' to set me up?
- What do I know?

01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:28.110
- Come on, man.
- I'm Homicide, man.

01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:32.119
How long we been
doin' business, huh?

01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:35.152
All of a sudden
it don't count for nothin'?

01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:38.317
All I know is, somebody says
Rodney's your buddy.

01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:41.955
He's not gonna break balls
if you go in. So?

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:43.592
Right, Rodney?

01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:48.030
Rocco Klein, Rocco Klein.
I always wanted to ask you.

01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:52.232
You Italian, you a Jew? What are you?
You can't make up your mind?

01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:53.872
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:57.549
I'm from the lost Black Tribe
of Israel, the Yos.

01:29:57.600 --> 01:30:01.195
Now put the rag away, lock up,
get your shit, and let's go.

01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:06.072
I'm a businessman, all right?
I'm tryin' to make a dollar.

01:30:06.120 --> 01:30:09.635
- Yeah, I'm proud of ya. Let's go.
- We got a job, too, OK?

01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:12.431
Skyler, go find Errol.

01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:14.948
Tell him to come down
and mind the store for me.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.594
Tell my wife to get
my bail money together, too.

01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:20.279
Give Errol my best, all right?

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:25.718

on that psychopath.

Yo, genius. Who do you think?

He's in a jam. It must've been
the chocolate Moos.

01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:22.272
Get the ball.
Yeah, get it. Good.

01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:33.429
Got it? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

with that bail situation?

- Down to $5,000.
- Word.

01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:55.833
Good. Good. It's about fuckin' time.
Check this out.

01:33:57.240 --> 01:33:59.435
Strike, somebody's gonna see you.

01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:03.514
Put that away. Hurry up.

01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:08.674
That's $5,000 right there,
all right?

01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:12.349
Give that to Mommy. Tell her
to get her son up out of jail.

01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:15.472
Don't tell her I gave it
to you, all right?

01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:17.511
You goin' somewhere?

01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:21.471
I might, but I don't know.

01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:25.195
Ronald, you need
to talk to your mother.

01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:31.070
- You listenin'?
- Yeah, I hear you.

01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:35.835
Thanks.

OK, let's go. The Dunham brothers
are up, and he catches it. Yes!

01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:00.638
- Yo, Scientific?
- What's up, B? What's up?

01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:02.750
What you guys
just sitting around for?

01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:06.110
What the fuck you yellin' at?
That nigger Rodney got locked up.

01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:08.037
- For what?
- You don't know why?

01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:10.674
- No, I don't.
- Strike!

01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:12.199
You know.

01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:14.515
- Yo, Strike! Yo, Strike!
- Y'all hold on.

01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:16.437
Yo, Shorty. Get out of here, man!

01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:19.472
I gotta talk to you.
I said I gotta talk to you!

01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:21.351
- Get out of here!
- Hey, Ronnie.

01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:23.550
- Stop iggin' me!
- Ah, fuck!

01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:25.716
Put it here, pal.

01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:28.149
Let me talk to you for a minute.

01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:30.156
So you wanna fuck with me?

01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:32.953
Let me show you
what fuckin's all about.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.434
What the fuck
you talkin' about, man?

01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:38.916
Your man is in the joint.
I just came by to thank you.

01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:42.191
Yo! Yo, fuck you, Rocco.
You can't pin this shit on me!

01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:45.710
Oh, no? All I know is that
Rodney makes bail tomorrow.

01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:47.432
He'll be back out on the street.

01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:49.869
What do you think your homies
will tell him?

01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:54.630
If I was you, I'd fly down to the
DA's office, get my ass protected.

01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:58.468
I don't even be fuckin' around
no more. I don't be hustlin'.

01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:00.317
Ronald, do yourself a favour.

01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:02.271
Tell me what really happened.

01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:05.437
How your boss Rodney
pressured you into doing Darryl.

01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:08.597
I tell you, that nigger
set Rodney up, man. I know it.

01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:13.509
Nobody wants you on this. You had
no choice. Rodney had you scared.

01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:15.152
Kill or be killed, right?

01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:18.158
You don't even know
what the fuck you talkin' about.

01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:20.350
You just got me killed
on some dumb shit.

01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:23.392
Black man say he didn't do somethin',
you don't believe him.

01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:26.238
Say he did do something,
you still don't believe him.

01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:27.713
Have a good life.

01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:30.751
Oh, fuck!

01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:36.998
Yo, y'all. I know you niggers
know I wouldn't diss Rodney.

01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:38.871
Homo-cide is buggin'. Word up.

01:36:38.920 --> 01:36:43.118
Word to Allah, man. You a
motherfuckin' punk ass lyin' bitch!

01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:46.591
Fuck you! I'll fuck you up!

01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:48.429
You a fuckin' snitch!

01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:51.790
That nigger snitched on Rodney!
And you punch like a bitch!

01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:35.278
Your mama's in her bed.

01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:37.515
Well, I ain't gonna wake her.

01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:39.596
You don't get it, do you?

01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:42.154
- Yo.
- 'Errol. '

01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:43.315
Yo.

01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:49.309
- I'm in the lockup.
- Lockup? For what?

01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:51.430
I don't know.

01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:54.472
I'm still trying
to figure it out myself.

01:37:56.200 --> 01:37:58.316
'But I know who put me here.

01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:02.591
'That little... punk ass Strike. '

01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:05.359
- 'Strike?'
- 'Mm-hmm. '

01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:09.236
'You know what you gotta do, right?'

01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:12.909
- 'It's done. '
- 'I'll see you tomorrow. '

01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:16.315
Yo.

01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:27.632
- You still around here, nigger?
- What you think?

01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:30.433
All right. I guess
Errol ain't find your ass yet.

01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:33.517
- Errol?. What he want?
- Yo, Strike!

01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:38.877
- What he want, stupid?
- How the fuck I'm 'posed to know?

01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:42.549
Maybe he wanna play
with your fuckin' train set

01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:48.877
- Man, fuck you.
- Fuck you, nigger! I mean, snitch.

01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:50.273
Shit.

01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:54.279
Yo, Shorty, how many...
How many times I gotta tell you, man?

01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:55.958
Stop sweatin' me. You a kid.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.719
This is grown-up stuff.
You gonna get hurt out here.

01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:01.752
Now, take your little bag
of candy, take your little bike

01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:04.234
and go find some friends, all right?

01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:06.669
Damn! Fuckin' kids, man.

01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:15.952
Oh, shit!

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.514
Boogie-Down was performing

01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:20.869
Down with the sounds called VDP

01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:22.512
Boogie-Down was performing

01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:25.832
It ain't no joke

01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:27.916
Back in the days
I knew rap would never die

01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:30.758
I used to listen
to Awesome-2 on WHBI

01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:32.631
I used to hear all kind
of rap groups

01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:35.797
Before samplin' loops
rappers wore bell-bottom Lee suits

01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:37.398
Me and Kenny couldn't afford that

01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:40.352
So we would go to the park
while they was jammin' to hear rap

01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:42.356
I used to listen
till the cops broke it up

01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:45.073
Always thought to myself
"Damn, why they fucked it up"

01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:47.680
But nevertheless
I was in love with the microphone

01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:49.995
And it stayed that way
until I left home

01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:52.156
On the streets of New York
now I'm free

01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:54.555
But with freedom
comes big responsibility

01:39:54.600 --> 01:39:56.636
I used to walk around
driven by the force

01:39:56.680 --> 01:39:59.558
I remember how large Super
Rhymes was when he fell off

01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:01.670
I used to wonder about crews
that used to rock

01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:04.393
They were large but none of them
could manage to stay on top

01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:06.271
Do you ever think about
when you outta here

01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:08.993
Record deal and video outta here

01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:11.190
Mercedes-Benz
and Range Rover outta here

01:40:11.240 --> 01:40:13.629
No doubt BDP is old school
but we ain't goin' out...

01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:15.750
What you want, little...

01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:22.198
Yo, Ty! Ty!

01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:24.390
You little motherfucker!

01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:28.558
Some years went by, I signed myself
into a group home...

01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:31.160
What the fuck is wrong with you, huh?
You buggin'?

01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:34.511
Shit.

01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:38.391
I don't know what happened.

01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:42.718
I've known this kid his whole life,
his mother, too. Good, decent people.

01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:46.548
Now, whatever happened out there,
it was a big mistake.

01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:50.798
I mean... I mean, Tyrone's never been
in trouble before. He's like...

01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:55.072
He's like, uh, 85th percentile
on the national education test.

01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:59.716
I mean, uh...
Now this thing could ruin his life.

01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:01.557
Please.

01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:06.237
Just help him with his moms
and his statement.

01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:08.515
You know what I'm askin'.

01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:23.509
Does my son have to go to jail?.

01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:30.669
Would you permit me to talk to him?

01:41:35.960 --> 01:41:38.997
If you talk to him, does he still
have to go to jail?.

01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:44.270
Tyrone, you know
what you did, don't you?

01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:47.596
- Yeah.
- You know it was wrong?

01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:54.519
- He knows.
- OK. We got that outta the way.

01:41:55.600 --> 01:41:57.591
You did wrong.

01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:02.950
But you were scared, right?
You couldn't help it.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:04.991
My son was terrified.

01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:13.399
Tyrone, you're a good kid, but it's
tough growin' up in the projects.

01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:18.275
Drugs, crime, peer pressure. You know
what that means, peer pressure?

01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:21.995
- Yes.
- I hear you're real intelligent.

01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:26.470
Don't your friends make fun of you

01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:29.637
when you get straight As,
speak correct English,

01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:32.956
attend school,
go to classes, don't hang out?

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.116
Don't they call you white boy?

01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:39.073
Don't they call you soft because
you ain't hanging with them hard?

01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:44.119
I know they do, but all you
want to do is the right thing.

01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:47.709
But they keep threatening you,
threatening your mother.

01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:50.916
Tyrone.

01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:53.838
So you get a gat.
So you, too, can be hard-core.

01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:56.713
Protect yourself and your mother.

01:42:56.760 --> 01:43:00.355
- Do you know the man you shot?
- Yeah.

01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:03.437
That was Errol Barnes,
a stone killer.

01:43:03.480 --> 01:43:07.075
He did time
for killin' a kid your age.

01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:10.032
Here you are, riding your bike,
minding your own business.

01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:11.752
You have a gun for protection.

01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:14.268
All of a sudden,
there's Errol, that kid killer,

01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:16.550
standing right in front of you.

01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:19.068
He's got this horrible look
in his beady eyes.

01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:20.872
You see him reaching...

01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:23.354
Tyrone, look at me.
Look at me, Tyrone.

01:43:23.400 --> 01:43:26.710
You see him reaching for that.38
stuck in his waist.

01:43:26.760 --> 01:43:30.992
You know he's gonna gat you.
Then who's gonna protect your mother?

01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:36.318
You never fired that gun before, but
Errol was about to pull that trigger.

01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:38.669
You're scared.

01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:41.951
All you wanna do is ride your bike.
It's either him or you.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:45.675
But this killer in front of you.
There's no time to think,

01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:47.790
his finger is on the trigger.

01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:52.509
Boom, boom. The gun just appeared
in your hand.

01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:54.630
That's what happened.

01:43:57.200 --> 01:43:59.270
That's what exactly happened.

01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:02.995
And when I ask you what happened
with the tape recorder on,

01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:07.830
that's exactly what
you're going to tell me, right?

01:44:07.880 --> 01:44:10.792
Because you always tell the truth.

01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:14.077
Now, one last thing.

01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:18.716
We need to know - again, tell
the truth - where'd you get the gat?

01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:22.998
- I found it.
- Where'd you find it?

01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:26.077
- In the bushes.
- Where in the bushes?

01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:31.789
I'm not turning it on yet.
Where in the bushes?

01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:35.799
- What bushes?
- The bushes near my building.

01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:38.957
Tyrone, you gotta help me out here.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:40.831
And your mama.

01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:45.191
The truth.

01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:50.911
OK. I borrowed it by accident.

01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:55.351
From who? Remember,
you always tell the truth.

01:44:55.400 --> 01:44:57.868
I borrowed it by accident
from Strike.

01:44:57.920 --> 01:44:59.638
Strike?

01:44:59.680 --> 01:45:01.477
Motherfucker!

01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:10.278
All right, son. All right.
You did the right thing.

01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:14.598
I was tryin' to give it back to him,
but he doesn't speak to me any more.

01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:18.713
I keep trying...
but he keeps iggin' me.

01:45:18.760 --> 01:45:20.716
All right, son.

01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:24.275
I'm gonna put the recorder on now.

01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:27.471
You state your name,
and you tell the story, relax,

01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:29.511
just the way you told it to me.

01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:35.273
- Your name?
- Tyrone Jeeter.

01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:40.111
Oh, shit.

01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:43.436
Fuck that nigger up, man!
What the fuck you doing?

01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:46.597
You ruined that boy's life,
you fuckin' parasite!

01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:48.756
I had nothin'
to do with that shit!

01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:50.597
I'm tired of excuses!

01:45:51.400 --> 01:45:52.628
Tired of excuses.

01:45:52.680 --> 01:45:55.319
- 'Mommy!'
- You know nothin'!

01:45:55.360 --> 01:45:58.113
"It's not my fault. "
I'm not hearin' that shit!

01:45:58.160 --> 01:46:00.799
It's motherfuckers like you
mugged Rosa Parks.

01:46:00.840 --> 01:46:03.832
- Who the fuck is Rosa Parks?
- Who the fuck is Rosa Parks?!

01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:07.668
- It's hard on the brothers.
- You stupid, ignorant motherfucker!

01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:12.111
Brothers?! Brothers! Is this the way
you take care of your brothers, huh?

01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:16.358
Real brothers take responsibility.
I'm gonna make damn sure you do.

01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:19.312
I won't be fuckin' around.
I'm done with that.

01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:21.112
Done with it? Done with that?

01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:23.754
You bet you are.
You are done from these streets.

01:46:23.800 --> 01:46:27.031
You're gone from this project,
and you're gone from New York.

01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:28.911
You hear me?

01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:30.791
Oh, shit!

01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:33.910
Come on, you son of a bitch!

01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:36.997
Yo, why don't you stomp
that nigger too, man?

01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:39.474
- Come on, man.
- Get back! Get back!

01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:41.954
- Gonna shoot everybody?
- Get the fuck back!

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.070
Come on! You want somethin'?

01:46:44.120 --> 01:46:47.112
You got it, man! You got it! What?

01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:49.751
Get up.

01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:51.995
Get up, get up, get up!

01:46:56.840 --> 01:47:00.958
If I ever see you again,
I'm going to kill you!

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.753
I'm gonna shoot you in your dome,
put a gun in your hand

01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:08.157
and say you tried to raise up on me
for this beat down you just got.

01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:12.229
Do you understand? Do you understand?

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:16.797
Shit!

01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:36.678
He wants to fly
but his wings won't let him go

01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:41.191
He wants to travel
but don't wanna go so low

01:47:41.240 --> 01:47:44.118
Oh-oh, Daddy, when I grow up

01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:46.310
I want to be a silent hero...

01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:50.035
Ah, look who's here!
I was just comin' to get you.

01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:53.031
Rodney or Andre?

01:47:57.080 --> 01:48:00.152
Rodney! Take a number, you're next!

01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:05.272
What'd you think
you was gonna do? Become president?

01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:08.471
Yo, man! Why did Tyrone
do that stupid shit for?

01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:11.557
The boy did it for you.
He was protecting you.

01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:14.273
Rodney ain't no fool.
He sent Errol after you,

01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:16.993
and this poor fuckin' kid
stepped into the breach.

01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:18.473
David and Goliath.

01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:22.195
Now he's a 12-year-old murderer.
Way to go, Strike.

01:48:22.240 --> 01:48:24.276
Yo, don't lay that on me, all right?

01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:25.673
Don't lay that on you?

01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:30.236
- I had nothin' to do with Tyrone.
- You had nothin' to do with it?

01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:33.272
Can you look yourself
in the fuckin' mirror and tell me

01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:35.197
you had nothin' to do with Tyrone?

01:48:35.240 --> 01:48:37.549
Why the fuck you have to come
shake my hand anyway?

01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:41.149
Didn't I tell you not to play me?
Did I not tell you that?

01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:44.875
I don't give a fuck what you said!
You can't put this weight on me!

01:48:44.920 --> 01:48:47.673
Nah, why should you carry
the fuckin' weight?

01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:49.995
You must be a wonderful
fuckin' guy,

01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:52.759
everybody tryin' to protect you
- Tyrone, Victor.

01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:56.395
You know what? They all went down
protecting you from the same guy,

01:48:56.440 --> 01:48:58.237
and he's still out there.

01:48:58.280 --> 01:49:00.555
I'm the only one
that can protect you now.

01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:03.034
That's right. Me. Me.

01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:06.390
So you tell me how Rodney
pressured you into cappin'...

01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:07.555
Oh, man!

01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:10.398
.. Darryl Adams,
and we'll drop him down a hole.

01:49:11.240 --> 01:49:14.471
Don't tell me Rodney
pulled the trigger if he didn't.

01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:17.398
All's you gotta do now
is tell me the truth.

01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:19.078
Did you shoot Darryl Adams?

01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:24.356
No, man, no. Damn.

01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:26.709
- Who did?
- Scientific.

01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:33.396
- Who the fuck is Scientific?
- He's with my crew.

01:49:33.440 --> 01:49:35.715
- Did you see him kill Darryl Adams?
- No.

01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:37.876
- Did he tell you he killed Darryl?.
- No!

01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:40.912
- Did he tell anybody?
- I don't know! Why you sweatin' me?

01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:42.473
It was Errol Barnes!

01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:46.638
Get up!
Get up, you fuckin' lyin' cocksucker!

01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:47.999
You crazy?

01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:51.316
I'm gonna hand-feed you
to fuckin' Rodney myself!

01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:53.999
I swear to God!
It was a nigger named My Man.

01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:56.076
My brother said My Man would do it.

01:49:56.120 --> 01:49:59.157
- My Man?
- I didn't have the heart to do him!

01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:02.510
- I didn't have the heart to do 'im!
- Victor said My Man would do it.

01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:05.074
We was in Kool Breeze and shit,
a- a-and Victor,

01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:07.588
he just told me,
he was like, he said, "My Man".

01:50:07.640 --> 01:50:10.712
Maybe Victor was so drunk
he did tell My Man to do it.

01:50:10.760 --> 01:50:13.149
Bullshit, bullshit!
Let's go see Rodney.

01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:14.315
Rocco.

01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:17.557
If you don't get your hand
off my son, you better...

01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:21.639
- Victor called me from the bar.
- You ain't gotta tell him nothin'.

01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:23.352
Victor called me from the bar.

01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:28.191
Mom? I think I'm gonna
do somethin' bad.

01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:31.589
Ma, I can feel it.

01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:34.473
Look, I'm just tired, that's all.

01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:36.670
I'm just sick and tired.

01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:42.553
And somebody's gotta pay.
Somebody's gotta pay.

01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:45.194
He came back into the house
an hour later.

01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:52.599
Victor! Baby, what's wrong?

01:50:55.400 --> 01:50:58.312
Oh, Mama, I shot somebody!

01:50:58.360 --> 01:51:01.033
I shot somebody.

01:51:03.160 --> 01:51:04.752
'He was throwin' up all night.

01:51:04.800 --> 01:51:08.190
'I didn't even know that other boy
was lyin' dead in the parking lot. '

01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:11.915
The next morning... he says
that he can't get out of bed -

01:51:11.960 --> 01:51:14.315
his legs are cramped, he can't walk.

01:51:14.360 --> 01:51:16.749
Mama, let me tell you,
it was just like a dream,

01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:19.997
like somebody else
was pullin' the trigger, you know?

01:51:27.920 --> 01:51:30.070
And that's what happened.

01:51:30.120 --> 01:51:32.350
Mommy, I swear,
I'm gonna help Victor.

01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:34.311
What is going to happen to my son?

01:51:34.360 --> 01:51:36.635
Did you get the money from Sharon?

01:51:36.680 --> 01:51:39.274
- Huh? For the bail?.
- She wouldn't take it.

01:51:51.800 --> 01:51:54.360
My son Victor...

01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:56.789
said it was self-defence.

01:51:56.840 --> 01:51:58.637
Believe him!

01:52:39.880 --> 01:52:41.518
Shit!

01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:45.633
Shit.

01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:53.195
"Bitch... you is dead. "

01:52:56.200 --> 01:52:59.636
Motherfucker
stole my bags, too.

01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:03.992
Yo, Strike. Your boy Rodney
took a piss in your car.

01:53:10.920 --> 01:53:13.150
So, where do you want
to live, Ronnie?

01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:16.317
I don't know, man.
You tell me.

01:53:17.920 --> 01:53:21.310
We's goin' to the Port Authority
Bus Terminal.

01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:25.197
Please, Rocco, man,
take me to Penn Station.

01:53:26.120 --> 01:53:27.758
Same difference.

01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:45.355
'Self-defence. Self-defence.

01:53:46.760 --> 01:53:49.877
'Victor is pleading self-defence. '

01:53:49.920 --> 01:53:53.469
So, what's up with Tyrone?
Does he get bail?.

01:53:56.200 --> 01:53:58.430
No bail on juveniles.

01:53:58.480 --> 01:54:01.597
His mother has him until the trial.

01:54:01.640 --> 01:54:04.438
So, how much time is he gonna get?

01:54:07.160 --> 01:54:10.755
Maybe a half-year
in a youth house, if he's lucky.

01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:16.158
Yo, Rocco, before I get out, man,
just answer me this one question.

01:54:16.200 --> 01:54:18.794
Why was you so gung-ho
about all this shit, man?

01:54:18.840 --> 01:54:20.353
Most cops...

01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:24.154
Brothers killin' other brothers
ain't no big thing. Blasé, blasé.

01:54:24.200 --> 01:54:29.274
What made you care about me, my
brother Victor, Darryl Adams, Tyrone?

01:54:29.320 --> 01:54:31.629
Huh? What made you give a shit?

01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:40.192
If I ever see you again,

01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:44.358
I'll book you on charges
of criminal solicitation

01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:47.153
and conspiracy to commit murder.

01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:50.351
I'll let Andre beat you down again,

01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:52.709
then pick up Rodney
on the same charges,

01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:55.513
and I'll make sure you two
share the same cell.

01:54:55.560 --> 01:54:57.551
The same fuckin' bed.

01:54:58.920 --> 01:55:00.956
Do you understand me clearly?

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.070
Yeah, I understand you clearly.

01:55:04.120 --> 01:55:08.079
I just wanted to say thanks, for
gettin' me outta town, that's all.

01:55:13.480 --> 01:55:16.677
It ain't mine, man.
I stopped doin' that.

01:55:19.200 --> 01:55:21.191
Get the fuck outta the car.

01:55:37.640 --> 01:55:41.189

How about you, sir?

01:56:32.320 --> 01:56:34.151
"I'll kill you. "

01:56:34.200 --> 01:56:37.590
I guess somebody read his shirt
the wrong way, huh?

01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:41.110
Whoo!
Right through his fuckin' mouth.

01:56:43.200 --> 01:56:45.873
Another stain on the sidewalk.

01:56:45.920 --> 01:56:49.708
- Hal! Lunch.
- Another dead motherfucker.

01:56:50.760 --> 01:56:54.150
DMF. All right.
Well, Hal, let's go to work.

01:56:54.200 --> 01:56:56.919
- Take it away, Lieutenant.
- OK. Catch you next time.

01:56:56.960 --> 01:56:58.359
Hey, guys.

01:56:58.400 --> 01:57:00.675
They should blow these projects
to Timbuktu.

01:57:00.720 --> 01:57:04.349
Why bother? They kill themselves
anyway, like a self-cleaning oven.

01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:05.992
No fuss, no mess.

01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:08.793
That's how the Nubians do it.
Cycle of shit.

01:57:08.840 --> 01:57:11.229
- Take it easy, guys.
- Take it easy.

01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:17.031
What the fuck happened?

01:57:17.080 --> 01:57:20.516
One snap, that kid
Scientific got shot up.

01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:22.551
What's a Scientific?

01:57:25.200 --> 01:57:29.637
That could be you next.
Mr Scientific.

01:57:29.680 --> 01:57:33.389
Nothin' you ain't seen
before, eh, fellas?

01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:36.115
Did you see anything over there?

01:57:36.160 --> 01:57:41.439
Back in the early 1900s,
when trains ran on batteries,

01:57:41.480 --> 01:57:44.392
when people had no electricity
in their houses...

01:57:45.880 --> 01:57:48.314
After World War II, right?

01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:50.157
- Tyrone.
- Huh?

01:57:50.200 --> 01:57:53.192
- You know I love you, don't you?
- Yeah.

01:57:56.920 --> 01:57:59.036
- After World War II, right?
- Yeah.

01:57:59.080 --> 01:58:02.436
When people started getting
electricity in their houses,

01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:05.233
they made these - the new ones.

01:58:05.280 --> 01:58:06.872
Wanna hear a whistle?

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:47.994
Here is my hand
for you to hold

01:59:49.040 --> 01:59:54.034
Here's a part of me
they have not sold

01:59:55.080 --> 02:00:00.154
I've wandered far, I've had my fill

02:00:01.200 --> 02:00:06.194
I need you now
do you love me still

02:00:07.240 --> 02:00:10.949
Only you have seen

02:00:13.200 --> 02:00:17.273
The hidden part of me

02:00:19.320 --> 02:00:24.269
Call me foolhardy if you will

02:00:25.440 --> 02:00:31.197
I loved you when
do you love me still

02:00:32.160 --> 02:00:37.359
So many smiles
and lies surround me

02:00:38.400 --> 02:00:43.155
Empty expectations, faceless fears

02:00:44.200 --> 02:00:48.591
Sometimes this life
is a bitter pill

02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:55.118
I love you now
do you love me still

02:01:20.080 --> 02:01:25.029
You have been mine
since time untold

02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:31.108
Our love is immortal don't you know

02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:37.029
Others will come and they will go

02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:43.234
But I loved you young
and I'll love you old

02:01:44.280 --> 02:01:49.195
Only you have seen

02:01:50.200 --> 02:01:53.556
The other side of me

02:01:56.320 --> 02:02:01.155
Call me naive, I think you will

02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:08.150
But I loved you then
do you love me still

02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:14.149
Here are the eyes that only see you

02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:20.320
Here's a mouth
that only calls your name

02:02:21.360 --> 02:02:25.638
Here is a song they cannot kill

02:02:26.680 --> 02:02:32.118
I love you now
do you love me still

02:02:33.305 --> 02:02:39.680
