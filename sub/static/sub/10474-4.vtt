MATURE JENNY: 'There was a
rhythm to the days in Poplar.

00:40.060 --> 00:43.850
'Church on Sunday, clinic
on a Tuesday afternoon,

00:43.900 --> 00:46.210
'wages paid each Friday

00:46.260 --> 00:50.130
'and babies born early or late
and hardly ever when expected.

00:50.180 --> 00:52.810
'But that they would arrive
was never doubted, or

00:52.860 --> 00:56.900
that for some there would
be pain as well as joy.'

00:58.980 --> 01:01.970
I don't know what's happened
to acting Sister Franklin!

01:02.020 --> 01:04.010
Clinic isn't going
to get any less busy

01:04.060 --> 01:07.330
just because she's decided
to make her grand entrance

01:07.380 --> 01:09.180
15 minutes late!

01:10.100 --> 01:11.690
Chop, chop!

01:11.740 --> 01:15.290
It would help if we didn't have to clear
up after the youth club every time.

01:15.340 --> 01:17.410
We have 32 expectant

01:17.460 --> 01:19.490
and post natal mothers
on the list today

01:19.540 --> 01:21.810
and 15 babies for vaccinations.

01:21.860 --> 01:26.170
In which case, you need to do your
best work, so we nurses can do ours.

01:26.220 --> 01:29.290
I'll make sure all of our patients
get ample time with a midwife

01:29.340 --> 01:31.250
and with Doctor, if they need it.

01:31.300 --> 01:32.850
Ample time?!

01:32.900 --> 01:35.730
Just keep moving them along
and lining them up.

01:35.780 --> 01:39.180
The medical staff will
decide what they need.

01:41.700 --> 01:45.010
If you're looking for your ashtray,
it was put in the wrong box.

01:45.060 --> 01:48.690
Nurse Crane. Once seen,
never forgotten.

01:48.740 --> 01:50.250
I was a midwife for ten years!

01:50.300 --> 01:52.770
BANGING ON DOOR All right, all right!

01:52.820 --> 01:55.570
Do you want me to call in
the bobbies on horseback?

01:55.620 --> 01:58.530
Nurse Mount, take Nurse
Franklin's list.

01:58.580 --> 02:02.410
And step to it, we can't
afford any slackers today.

02:02.460 --> 02:05.200
CHILD: Come on, let's get in first.

02:05.260 --> 02:06.850
Good morning, ladies!

02:06.900 --> 02:08.169
BABY WAILS

02:08.220 --> 02:09.889
Good morning!

02:12.340 --> 02:16.770
I've been on the telephone with the Bishop's
secretary for the last half an hour.

02:16.820 --> 02:18.570
Well, go on. Don't be a tease.

02:18.620 --> 02:21.370
What did the Bishop want
with a lowly curate?

02:21.420 --> 02:23.650
Apparently, he likes the
work I've been doing,

02:23.700 --> 02:25.970
wants to meet me in
person to tell me so.

02:26.020 --> 02:27.290
How marvellous.

02:27.340 --> 02:30.050
Are we supposed to go to
him or is he coming here?

02:30.100 --> 02:33.090
Well, he'll want to
meet me too, won't he?

02:33.140 --> 02:34.890
I didn't actually ask him.

02:34.940 --> 02:37.370
Well, of course he will.
I'm going to be your wife.

02:37.420 --> 02:39.930
Well, I think the bishop would
be very foolish not to want to

02:39.980 --> 02:42.290
meet the best asset
this lowly curate has.

02:42.340 --> 02:45.420
Make sure you get straight back
on the telephone and tell him so.

02:48.140 --> 02:50.450
NURSE CRANE: Come along now.

02:50.500 --> 02:52.970
Oh, rotten pains in my back, yeah.

02:53.020 --> 02:57.020
Oh, and the midwife telling
me I'm not even in labour.

02:58.460 --> 03:01.650
Mrs Colter, please. Didn't
we discuss this?

03:01.700 --> 03:04.490
Not upsetting these mothers
with your anecdotes,

03:04.540 --> 03:06.770
not least of all your daughter-in-law.

03:06.820 --> 03:09.050
I won't have her believing
any fairy stories,

03:09.100 --> 03:12.050
nurse, about the "miracle
of childbirth".

03:12.100 --> 03:15.100
But you'd happily fill her
head with Grimms' tales?

03:18.100 --> 03:21.060
~ Mrs Cole? Mrs Bridget Cole?
~ Me.

03:31.220 --> 03:33.930
There's a very reliable clock
on the church tower -

03:33.980 --> 03:36.490
I suggest you set your watch by it.

03:36.540 --> 03:38.770
I'm sorry, Nurse Crane.

03:38.820 --> 03:40.570
It's not good enough.

03:40.620 --> 03:44.290
As acting sister, you should
be an example to the others.

03:44.340 --> 03:46.280
Pull your socks up!

03:47.620 --> 03:49.930
I sometimes think you've got
as many frills inside that

03:49.980 --> 03:52.520
head as you've got on that cap.

03:54.980 --> 03:59.450
King Henry VIII, six
wives he wedded -

03:59.500 --> 04:01.650
one died, one survived,

04:01.700 --> 04:05.570
two divorced, two beheaded.

04:05.620 --> 04:09.330
Poor Anne Boleyn was the first
to have her head chopped off with

04:09.380 --> 04:11.650
a very sharp sword.

04:11.700 --> 04:15.090
~ Ugh!
~ One good swing and off it rolled.

04:15.140 --> 04:18.860
What do you think you're doing?!
They're five year olds!

04:19.860 --> 04:21.769
Mrs Bowe, what's the matter?

04:21.820 --> 04:24.290
She was telling him such stories.

04:24.340 --> 04:27.290
I'll not get him off
to sleep tonight.

04:27.340 --> 04:30.580
I was merely nurturing
our fledging historians.

04:31.660 --> 04:33.330
I know you were, Sister.

04:33.380 --> 04:37.260
But perhaps, just for now, you
might help me roll some bandages?

04:42.540 --> 04:46.530
Your pregnancy is quite advanced for this
to be your fist clinic visit, Mrs Cole.

04:46.580 --> 04:49.170
I haven't really had time before
now - been busy working -

04:49.220 --> 04:51.020
and it's 'Miss'.

04:53.180 --> 04:56.880
Do you think that makes
me a wicked woman, Sister?

04:57.220 --> 05:00.210
You're here as a mother-to-be
and I'm here as a midwife.

05:00.260 --> 05:04.330
Let's leave questions of wickedness
at the door, shall we?

05:04.380 --> 05:07.290
The first thing we'll do is
take your medical history,

05:07.340 --> 05:10.450
then check your weight and blood
pressure and baby's heartbeat.

05:10.500 --> 05:14.970
After that, Dr Turner will need
to take a blood sample from you.

05:15.020 --> 05:16.820
Pass it through.

05:25.660 --> 05:28.850
We've got orders from Billingham's
for more cable-laid rope

05:28.900 --> 05:32.210
and Reeks want lengths
of 18 thread yarn.

05:32.260 --> 05:35.010
~ That's what we like to hear!
~ Isn't it just?

05:35.060 --> 05:38.650
We're heading for the best summer
we've had for a fair while.

05:38.700 --> 05:40.610
It'd mean the world to my old dad,

05:40.660 --> 05:43.900
seeing the business thriving,
seeing it all kept alive.

05:44.900 --> 05:47.770
This would mean the world and all.

05:47.820 --> 05:49.970
Someone to follow in his footsteps

05:50.020 --> 05:51.490
and mine.

05:53.420 --> 05:56.250
Mrs Robbins, I thought
I'd missed you!

05:56.300 --> 05:59.370
Sorry, I didn't see the time.

05:59.420 --> 06:02.090
This is my husband Frank.

06:02.140 --> 06:04.140
Pleased to meet you.

06:04.580 --> 06:06.210
Is everything all right?

06:06.260 --> 06:07.810
Oh, it's just a routine call.

06:07.860 --> 06:10.610
~ Need to check everything's
ready for the baby.
~ Ready?

06:10.660 --> 06:14.330
She's bought enough and knitted enough
to kit out a full ship's crew.

06:14.380 --> 06:16.650
There's nothing like being prepared.

06:16.700 --> 06:18.500
~ See ya.
~ See ya.

06:20.140 --> 06:23.410
I sometimes reckon he's the
hardest working man in Poplar.

06:23.460 --> 06:27.450
When it comes out, Nurse, just
you make sure it's a boy.

06:27.500 --> 06:29.040
SHE LAUGHS

06:32.100 --> 06:33.610
On an invitation

06:33.660 --> 06:36.530
you'd put "The Right Reverend
the Lord Billy Smith,

06:36.580 --> 06:38.130
"Bishop of wherever".

06:38.180 --> 06:41.050
But in person, you should call
him either just "Bishop"

06:41.100 --> 06:42.970
or "My Lord Bishop".

06:43.020 --> 06:47.530
Oh. I was going to call him "Your
Grace". Have I got that wrong?

06:47.580 --> 06:49.050
Your call, Babs!

06:49.100 --> 06:52.930
"Your Grace" is just for Archbishops,
not that I've ever met one.

06:52.980 --> 06:56.130
My father's parish was in the
roughest bit of Liverpool.

06:56.180 --> 06:59.450
When I turned 21, my godmother
said I could choose

06:59.500 --> 07:03.690
between a holiday in Portofino
or a course at Lucie Clayton.

07:03.740 --> 07:05.770
I'm starting to wish
I'd picked the latter.

07:05.820 --> 07:09.650
I've never been abroad. I'd plump
for Portofino every time.

07:09.700 --> 07:12.330
Oh, you'd hate it.
They don't sell Tizer.

07:12.380 --> 07:13.530
THEY LAUGH

07:13.580 --> 07:17.170
To be frank, Trixie, I don't know why you're
rolling out all these whistles and bells.

07:17.220 --> 07:19.250
Surely all the usual
etiquettes apply.

07:19.300 --> 07:21.970
Don't talk with your mouth full
and never discuss politics,

07:22.020 --> 07:23.370
money or religion.

07:23.420 --> 07:26.570
How can I not discuss
religion? He's a bishop.

07:26.620 --> 07:29.610
Perhaps you should make a list
of interesting things to say

07:29.660 --> 07:32.850
about the weather and what's
going on in Somaliland.

07:32.900 --> 07:34.850
Why Somaliland?

07:34.900 --> 07:39.450
It's been in the news and clergymen
love news from Africa.

07:39.500 --> 07:40.970
SHE SIGHS

07:41.860 --> 07:43.930
I need another drink.

07:59.220 --> 08:02.450
~ WOMAN: Hello, sweetheart.
~ You all right, Brenda?

08:02.500 --> 08:04.640
Going inside, are you?

08:10.620 --> 08:14.180
JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS

08:17.100 --> 08:19.450
SHE COUGHS

08:19.500 --> 08:21.540
PEOPLE CHATTER

08:23.140 --> 08:25.130
Hello, I'm Sister Winifred.

08:25.180 --> 08:29.730
I think nobody here wants
saving. Thanks all the same.

08:29.780 --> 08:31.690
No, actually, I'm the midwife.

08:31.740 --> 08:33.809
I'm here to see Miss Cole.

08:33.860 --> 08:37.169
Ah!! Bridget! Come after me, please.

08:37.220 --> 08:38.659
Yes, up.

08:41.299 --> 08:43.690
Everything here seems
to be in good order.

08:43.740 --> 08:45.890
I'm sure I must have
forgotten something.

08:45.940 --> 08:48.250
MAN: 'Where you going?!'

08:48.300 --> 08:50.980
It's not always so bad as this.

08:53.860 --> 08:57.980
Hope you remember what you said, about leaving
talk of wickedness outside the door.

09:02.620 --> 09:05.370
Do you intend to go back to your
business after baby's born?

09:05.420 --> 09:07.490
I never really stopped.

09:07.540 --> 09:11.210
I don't do the full works.

09:11.260 --> 09:14.010
Can't lose my regulars.

09:14.060 --> 09:16.730
I'm just wondering...

09:16.780 --> 09:20.620
Do you think this is the right
kind of place to bring up a child?

09:22.380 --> 09:26.050
It's my home, my family.

09:26.100 --> 09:27.730
This baby won't ever want for love,

09:27.780 --> 09:29.450
isn't that what's important?

09:29.500 --> 09:31.490
GLASS SMASHES

09:31.540 --> 09:32.860
Dora!

09:36.220 --> 09:39.450
Dora, come away from
there in your bare feet.

09:39.500 --> 09:42.530
Did I do that? Break that?

09:42.580 --> 09:44.250
It's OK.

09:44.300 --> 09:45.810
Who's this?!

09:45.860 --> 09:49.130
Dora. This is Sister
Winifred, the midwife.

09:49.180 --> 09:52.090
She's come to check everything's
ready for my little bun.

09:52.140 --> 09:54.050
I should have a look at that for you.

09:54.100 --> 09:56.370
Let the sister have a look.
She's from the clinic.

09:56.420 --> 09:59.730
No! I'll have no doctor lock me up!

09:59.780 --> 10:01.210
Dora, don't be silly.

10:01.260 --> 10:03.010
I'll go to no hospital!

10:03.060 --> 10:04.890
I just want to clean the wound, Dora.

10:04.940 --> 10:08.380
Once they get their hands on
me, they won't let me out.

10:09.860 --> 10:12.600
Let me. She'll be fine if I do it.

10:15.940 --> 10:19.210
It's probably best if you
go, Sister. I'm sorry.

10:19.260 --> 10:22.200
She won't calm down
while you're here.

10:26.140 --> 10:28.330
I'm sorry.

10:28.380 --> 10:32.330
When she gets in a state, only
really me can calm her down.

10:32.380 --> 10:35.210
She doesn't really trust
any of the other girls.

10:35.260 --> 10:37.850
Is she always
disorientated like that?

10:37.900 --> 10:39.170
Comes and goes.

10:39.220 --> 10:42.250
But she has been getting
worse, the last few months.

10:42.300 --> 10:44.850
Those lesions, they're
known as gummas.

10:44.900 --> 10:48.210
~ I'd like to bring Dr Turner
to examine her and...
~ No.

10:48.260 --> 10:51.530
You heard how she is about doctors.
It's a terror she has.

10:51.580 --> 10:53.290
She needs treatment.

10:53.340 --> 10:56.700
I think what Dora is suffering
from is quite advanced syphilis.

10:58.980 --> 11:00.890
You knew?

11:00.940 --> 11:04.210
She'd had it for years,
ever since I've known her.

11:04.260 --> 11:07.810
~ You can't go on looking
after her in your condition.
~ We're fine.

11:07.860 --> 11:10.130
We look after each other.

11:13.580 --> 11:16.930
I think we're ready. I hope we are.

11:16.980 --> 11:19.370
~ Goodness!
~ Please.

11:19.420 --> 11:21.960
I see what your husband meant!

11:27.260 --> 11:31.970
And what about this beautiful
little thing? Did you knit this?

11:32.020 --> 11:34.170
No, my mother,

11:34.220 --> 11:37.490
God rest her soul. Was
mine when I was a baby.

11:37.540 --> 11:39.730
She saved it for me...

11:39.780 --> 11:41.730
in case I have a daughter of my own.

11:41.780 --> 11:44.170
Mrs Robbins, whatever
your husband says,

11:44.220 --> 11:46.730
it's perfectly all right for
you to want a little girl.

11:46.780 --> 11:50.810
As long as it's healthy,
I don't mind what it is.

11:50.860 --> 11:52.770
I don't want to let Frank down.

11:52.820 --> 11:56.930
I really can't believe when the
day comes he'll see it like that.

11:56.980 --> 12:00.480
We've been wanting a baby
for such a long time.

12:02.140 --> 12:04.770
We got to thinking it was
never going to happen.

12:04.820 --> 12:08.010
And now it has and that's
just wonderful -

12:08.060 --> 12:10.330
boy or girl.

12:10.380 --> 12:11.850
Isn't it?

12:13.580 --> 12:15.890
I wanted to go straight
round to that ropery

12:15.940 --> 12:18.810
and tell Mrs Robbins' husband
he was being most unfair.

12:18.860 --> 12:22.250
It's one thing to quietly hope
and quite another to go on and on

12:22.300 --> 12:24.210
until his wife is terrified.

12:24.260 --> 12:25.970
Male or female, for good or ill,

12:26.020 --> 12:29.050
that baby's gender was
decided months ago.

12:29.100 --> 12:32.130
All the same, I'm baffled that
anyone thinks that girls

12:32.180 --> 12:33.570
aren't the equal of boys.

12:33.620 --> 12:37.210
I don't think they are the equal
of boys - I think they're better.

12:37.260 --> 12:40.570
But what if the girls themselves
don't think they're better?

12:40.620 --> 12:44.970
The women I visited today are
selling themselves so cheaply.

12:45.020 --> 12:47.370
What other wares have they to offer,

12:47.420 --> 12:51.850
but to live in the rank sweat of an
enseamed bed, stew'd in corruption,

12:51.900 --> 12:54.530
honeying and making love?

12:54.580 --> 12:58.210
I sometimes wonder what the last
two wars were for, in that respect.

12:58.260 --> 13:00.930
Every time the world
goes up in flames,

13:00.980 --> 13:04.530
they draft women in to pick up
the slack and then once it's over,

13:04.580 --> 13:08.010
it's back in your box
and don't say boo!

13:08.060 --> 13:12.010
And now, keeping one hand
under baby's bottom,

13:12.060 --> 13:15.460
we lower our little boy
or girl into the bath.

13:17.700 --> 13:20.770
If you've tested the water
correctly, with your elbow,

13:20.820 --> 13:24.450
baby shouldn't be too startled
by the change in temperature.

13:24.500 --> 13:28.250
~ QUIET SOBBING Mrs Robbins?
~ Sorry.

13:28.300 --> 13:31.740
I know it's a doll,
not a real baby...

13:33.060 --> 13:35.810
I think everything's getting
just a bit too much, isn't it?

13:35.860 --> 13:38.370
Hormones can be beastly things.

13:38.420 --> 13:40.160
Nurse Gilbert!

13:41.420 --> 13:44.580
I think Mrs Robbins needs
a little sit down.

13:46.740 --> 13:51.450
~ Sister, are you free to come
with me on a house call?
~ Of course, Doctor.

13:51.500 --> 13:55.660
~ Which patient is it?
~ Bridget Cole. Her blood tests came back.

13:57.060 --> 14:00.970
I'll have a word with Dr Turner and
tell him you haven't been sleeping.

14:01.020 --> 14:04.690
If you're lucky, he might give
you a sedative to help you sleep.

14:04.740 --> 14:09.130
The most important thing is that
you rest and try not to worry.

14:09.180 --> 14:11.570
I wouldn't be surprised if
he's not already thinking

14:11.620 --> 14:14.290
he can find some young
slip of a thing instead.

14:14.340 --> 14:15.970
What on Earth do you mean?

14:16.020 --> 14:19.330
Some girl still young enough
to give him... two,

14:19.380 --> 14:22.850
three... half a dozen sons.

14:22.900 --> 14:25.980
I'm sure it hasn't
even crossed his mind.

14:35.140 --> 14:38.930
Didn't I say? Dora doesn't want
to see a doctor, she just won't!

14:38.980 --> 14:42.050
Miss Cole, he's not here about Dora.

14:42.100 --> 14:44.940
Go on, Dora. Go on.

14:46.620 --> 14:49.850
It's about the blood sample
we took at the clinic.

14:49.900 --> 14:54.180
Miss Cole, the result shows that
you're infected with syphilis.

14:55.260 --> 14:57.930
I can't be. How can I?

14:57.980 --> 15:00.930
If it goes untreated, there are
very serious consequences for you.

15:00.980 --> 15:02.410
I always took precautions,

15:02.460 --> 15:05.690
always used a proper peroxide
douche after all my customers.

15:05.740 --> 15:08.970
The use of a douche is not enough
to fight an infection like this.

15:09.020 --> 15:12.370
This syphilis could also endanger
the life of your baby.

15:12.420 --> 15:15.290
We need to transfer you to
the maternity home to begin

15:15.340 --> 15:16.970
a course of penicillin injections.

15:17.020 --> 15:20.370
There is a chance, if the disease
is at an early stage,

15:20.420 --> 15:23.360
the infection may
still be contagious.

15:24.780 --> 15:26.320
Oh, my God!

15:34.380 --> 15:40.450
~ Good afternoon, Mr Robbins.
Are you here about your wife?
~ No, I'm not.

15:40.500 --> 15:42.730
It's my father's birthday today.

15:42.780 --> 15:45.410
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to intrude.

15:45.460 --> 15:48.260
No, it's all out in the open, Nurse.

15:49.900 --> 15:52.890
Frank was my father.

15:52.940 --> 15:56.380
His sons are me and my
brothers, Bill and John.

15:59.060 --> 16:03.610
17th of September 1939, my
dad's ship was torpedoed -

16:03.660 --> 16:05.730
he went down with it.

16:06.900 --> 16:10.730
In the spring of '45, my
brothers got blown up.

16:10.780 --> 16:14.530
They were on a minesweeper
in the Bay of Biscay.

16:14.580 --> 16:18.170
I ended up with three sets of
medals and the family business.

16:18.220 --> 16:21.320
This is their memorial,
most of the time.

16:22.460 --> 16:25.400
But on special occasions,
I come here.

16:45.140 --> 16:48.640
I'm going to bring my son
when he's old enough.

16:54.140 --> 16:57.970
Mr Robbins, the baby may be
a boy, but may also be a girl.

16:58.020 --> 17:00.930
Your wife can't choose
and neither can you.

17:00.980 --> 17:04.569
I promised my dad to carry
on the business with a son.

17:04.619 --> 17:06.290
I need a son.

17:17.940 --> 17:19.770
Hello there.

17:19.819 --> 17:23.329
Tom, what do you think about offering
the Bishop something more

17:23.380 --> 17:27.050
continental for afternoon
tea? Or is traditional best?

17:27.099 --> 17:30.650
Dainty sandwiches, jam, cream
scones, lots of Darjeeling?

17:30.700 --> 17:32.330
I could ask Barbara.

17:32.380 --> 17:35.570
She seems to know everything about
bishops and all the etiquette.

17:35.620 --> 17:39.210
~ Trixie...
~ You see, her father is a canon,
he's a residentiary one,

17:39.260 --> 17:40.690
not an honorary one.

17:40.740 --> 17:42.930
Did you know there
are different kinds?

17:42.980 --> 17:47.130
Trixie, when the Bishop comes,
you just need to relax.

17:47.180 --> 17:49.690
Remember, he's coming
primarily to speak to me.

17:49.740 --> 17:52.170
Now, I'm expected by the
summer fete committee

17:52.220 --> 17:54.890
and I'm at least 20 minutes late.

18:01.820 --> 18:06.220
Welcome to the Poplar Ritz. Full room
service and tea in constant supply.

18:07.700 --> 18:09.970
I'll leave you to unpack.

18:13.420 --> 18:17.490
I'll be back shortly to give
you your first injection.

18:17.540 --> 18:20.280
I tried to get rid of it, you know?

18:21.020 --> 18:22.690
Gin and a hot bath.

18:22.740 --> 18:24.880
Never fails, Dora said.

18:25.740 --> 18:30.330
By the time I knew it hadn't worked,
must have been four months gone.

18:30.380 --> 18:33.570
Went to a woman to
have it dealt with.

18:33.620 --> 18:37.010
Got as far as her door,
but I couldn't do it.

18:37.060 --> 18:38.970
Why not?

18:39.020 --> 18:44.130
I thought, if it's so keen to get
itself born, might as well go

18:44.180 --> 18:46.570
and have it...

18:46.620 --> 18:48.260
and love it.

18:49.300 --> 18:51.770
Give it the love I never had.

18:54.340 --> 18:56.130
And now,

18:56.180 --> 18:59.690
I could be bringing it
into the world diseased,

18:59.740 --> 19:03.410
~ like I'm diseased.
~ Bridget, you're here to have treatment.

19:03.460 --> 19:06.930
There's a decent chance your baby
will be healthy when it's born

19:06.980 --> 19:10.210
and that you'll be well enough
to take good care of it.

19:10.260 --> 19:12.400
I am grateful, Sister.

19:14.900 --> 19:17.570
SHE SIGHS

19:17.620 --> 19:22.050
I just don't understand why after
such great strides in modern

19:22.100 --> 19:25.690
medicine, we're still treating women
like Bridget Cole for syphilis.

19:25.740 --> 19:27.050
Well, it's largely

19:27.100 --> 19:30.770
because these girls refuse to ask
their clients to use sheaths.

19:30.820 --> 19:33.250
But that doesn't make sense.

19:33.300 --> 19:38.010
~ Has nobody explained to them?
~ Yes. I tried myself some years ago.

19:38.060 --> 19:41.130
They told me their customers
don't like them

19:41.180 --> 19:43.210
and that was the end of the matter.

19:43.260 --> 19:48.130
~ But surely their customers are at risk too.
~ Of course they are.

19:48.180 --> 19:52.010
Here's last year's report
from the Board of Health -

19:52.060 --> 19:55.340
every instance of venereal
disease meticulously noted.

19:56.700 --> 20:01.890
If I could, I'd force every man who
sidles down Cable Street to read it

20:01.940 --> 20:05.570
and they'd still say using a sheath
is like going for a paddle

20:05.620 --> 20:07.560
with your socks on.

20:10.060 --> 20:12.770

20:25.660 --> 20:28.130
I must have cycled 20 miles today.

20:28.180 --> 20:31.130
I walked in from those bike
sheds like John Wayne.

20:31.180 --> 20:34.250
I was beginning to
think you'd forgotten!

20:34.300 --> 20:39.010
We said we'd go to the Hand and Shears
to have a little brightener.

20:39.060 --> 20:41.530
Out of your uniform, spit-spot.

20:41.580 --> 20:45.220
If you're good, I'll treat
you to a bitter lemon.

20:48.740 --> 20:51.410
~ Sergeant Noakes?
~ Oh, evening, Sister.

20:51.460 --> 20:54.770
I was testing out what they
say about a watched pot.

20:54.820 --> 20:59.810
~ Oh, what's that then?
~ That it never boils.
~ Oh.

20:59.860 --> 21:03.050
Sergeant Noakes, how many
prostitutes are there in Poplar?

21:03.100 --> 21:04.810
Um...

21:04.860 --> 21:07.530
Well, I don't know exactly. Um...

21:08.540 --> 21:11.970
As an educated guess, perhaps...

21:12.020 --> 21:14.250
Six or 700?

21:14.300 --> 21:16.770
Can you introduce me to some?

21:18.940 --> 21:21.850
And what exactly is it
you plan to do, Sister?

21:21.900 --> 21:25.450
I'm hoping that by educating
the women in these places and

21:25.500 --> 21:29.970
encouraging them to use sheaths, I'd
be helping them protect themselves,

21:30.020 --> 21:33.050
meaning we won't have
any more Bridget Coles.

21:33.100 --> 21:35.770
Might I be excused Compline?

21:35.820 --> 21:39.290
~ You want to start tonight?
~ Yes. And not too late.

21:39.340 --> 21:42.900
Sergeant Noakes thinks we ought
to try to miss their rush hour.

21:46.980 --> 21:50.730
I'm in your hands, Sergeant
Noakes. Where shall we start?

21:50.780 --> 21:53.410
This way, Sister.

21:53.460 --> 21:55.050
You'll be all right.

22:29.220 --> 22:31.610
There's plenty of other

22:31.660 --> 22:34.600
if I start waving
rubbers in his face.

22:40.940 --> 22:42.930
Binky?! Really?

22:42.980 --> 22:45.850
His wife calls him Binky?

22:45.900 --> 22:48.410
The more I hear about my
Bishop, the more I like him.

22:48.460 --> 22:52.330
Well, this is all according to Pop,
who only knows him by reputation.

22:52.380 --> 22:55.570
But he tells me the Bishop
is teetotal and rather

22:55.620 --> 22:58.570
passionate about it, so don't let
him know how much you like a drink!

22:58.620 --> 23:01.850
~ How much I like a drink?
~ Oh, you know what I mean.

23:01.900 --> 23:03.290
At the end of a day,

23:03.340 --> 23:07.210
Patsy and I always like to guess
how soon Trixie's Bar will open!

23:07.260 --> 23:10.290
And that's what you
call it? Trixie's Bar?

23:10.340 --> 23:12.810
It's all said in fun, Trixie.

23:21.380 --> 23:24.380
Aren't you coming down
for tea, Sister?

23:26.420 --> 23:29.820
I understand we have Battenburg cake.

23:30.980 --> 23:34.010
I saw them marching, like Amazons,

23:34.060 --> 23:38.050
banners billowing, votes for women!

23:38.100 --> 23:41.780
I would have joined them,
had I not labours of my own.

23:48.060 --> 23:50.130
See how young she is.

23:51.060 --> 23:52.860
My 40th year.

23:58.060 --> 24:00.460
Such a summer it was.

24:01.620 --> 24:03.970
I remember women, decent women,

24:04.020 --> 24:08.730
wading into the Serpentine on
the day of the coronation...

24:08.780 --> 24:10.980
for King George.

24:13.780 --> 24:18.050
I carried my purpose
wherever it was needed,

24:18.100 --> 24:22.140
putting the putrid beasts of squalor
and disease to the sword.

24:25.420 --> 24:27.860
I was so capable then...

24:29.100 --> 24:31.690
.. agile...

24:31.740 --> 24:33.880
like a swift in slight.

24:35.700 --> 24:38.300
At the very height of my powers.

24:42.780 --> 24:43.890
And now...

24:43.940 --> 24:45.620
SHE SCOFFS

24:47.820 --> 24:52.770
~ Sister, you're still a valued
part of Nonnatus House.
~ No.

24:52.820 --> 24:54.490
I'm a relic,

24:54.540 --> 24:58.460
a curiosity and a nuisance.

25:00.820 --> 25:03.730
They say in the newspaper
we're degenerate.

25:03.780 --> 25:06.980
They call us common
prostitutes. SHE WINCES

25:10.060 --> 25:13.490
And all of that makes
us stick together.

25:13.540 --> 25:16.890
Do you want your child growing
up in an environment like that?

25:16.940 --> 25:18.730
Not really.

25:18.780 --> 25:22.050
But can you see me working
in an office, day after day?

25:22.100 --> 25:23.810
Or as a housewife?

25:23.860 --> 25:26.810
~ I went to visit a very nice
mother and baby home last week.
~ Oh.

25:26.860 --> 25:29.610
I know about those places.

25:29.660 --> 25:33.130
Dormitories, daily chores,
lots of prayers...

25:33.180 --> 25:35.650
This place isn't at all like that.

25:35.700 --> 25:37.930
One of the midwives from
Nonnatus works there

25:37.980 --> 25:41.410
and she's very good at setting
up fresh chances for new mums.

25:41.460 --> 25:43.170
KNOCK AT DOOR

25:43.220 --> 25:45.560
The desk woman say it's OK.

25:46.380 --> 25:49.250
Well, all right. But you
must put on this gown

25:49.300 --> 25:53.300
and take it off and wash
your hands before you leave.

25:54.140 --> 25:56.130
Everybody miss you, Bridget,

25:56.180 --> 25:58.180
especially Dora.

26:05.060 --> 26:09.690
~ So, Dora's going crazy since you not there.
~ What are you talking about?

26:09.740 --> 26:13.420
So, put the clothes on. I will
check if the nurse is coming back.

26:16.740 --> 26:20.370
Tom, I'm not sure if my
secretary told you why

26:20.420 --> 26:22.410
I wanted to meet you today.

26:22.460 --> 26:26.490
No. Just that you were reasonably
happy with the work I've been doing.

26:26.540 --> 26:29.370
Very happy. Very happy indeed.

26:29.420 --> 26:31.050
You've shown the kind of freshness

26:31.100 --> 26:34.970
and vigour that the
modern Church needs.

26:35.020 --> 26:36.330
No.

26:36.380 --> 26:40.890
So much so that when I heard about
a parish that was coming vacant,

26:40.940 --> 26:45.650
not immediately, the man in the
chair, an old and dear friend is

26:45.700 --> 26:50.540
due to retire in a year, I thought
you might be just right for it.

26:52.220 --> 26:54.490
I see.

26:54.540 --> 26:56.730
Goodness!

26:56.780 --> 26:59.250
I... I'm very gratified, Bishop.

26:59.300 --> 27:01.330
It's in St Anne's,

27:01.380 --> 27:04.980
a pretty challenging area
of poverty in Newcastle.

27:06.380 --> 27:08.570
Newcastle?

27:08.620 --> 27:12.170
I'm sorry, it's just that we
had in mind a more rural home to

27:12.220 --> 27:14.360
bring up our children.

27:22.420 --> 27:25.450
I'll make another
pot of tea, shall I?

27:25.500 --> 27:29.930
The parish has its fair share
of delinquents and unfortunates,

27:29.980 --> 27:33.700
but I'm sure there are rough
diamonds to be found.

27:38.700 --> 27:42.610
You'll be glad to hear Mrs Alice
Ambrose has had a healthy baby girl.

27:42.660 --> 27:46.010
Oh, splendid! I'm afraid you
won't have time for a rest.

27:46.060 --> 27:48.690
We've just had a call. It sounds
like Mrs Colter's in labour.

27:48.740 --> 27:50.940
Right, off I go!

27:52.140 --> 27:54.090
Oh, you can sterilise
when you get there.

27:54.140 --> 27:56.970
Was the call from June Colter
or is her mother-in-law still

27:57.020 --> 28:00.620
~ staying over?
~ I'm afraid it was her mother-in-law.

28:05.220 --> 28:08.650
Trixie, all I'm saying is
it wasn't your place or mine

28:08.700 --> 28:10.170
to take the Bishop to task.

28:10.220 --> 28:14.010
He was talking about sending us
to a slum district in Newcastle!

28:14.060 --> 28:16.730
I just said I was hoping for
something less... challenging.

28:16.780 --> 28:19.050
And then sat there with a face
like thunder for the rest

28:19.100 --> 28:20.450
of the afternoon.

28:20.500 --> 28:23.650
It was made very clear that
I shouldn't talk while the men

28:23.700 --> 28:27.420
were discussing important matters
that clearly I have no say in!

28:36.140 --> 28:38.140
Trixie...

28:40.940 --> 28:43.890
This morning, I sat with
a man whose wife had died.

28:43.940 --> 28:47.610
She was 21 and had Hodgkins Disease.

28:47.660 --> 28:49.970
He wanted me to explain God's plan.

28:50.020 --> 28:53.220
He wanted to know why it was
worth him living any more.

28:54.460 --> 28:58.690
That, for me, is what life
in the Church is about

28:58.740 --> 29:03.210
and that is why I will go where the
Bishop feels I can do most good.

29:03.260 --> 29:06.490
I understand that. Really, I do.

29:06.540 --> 29:10.610
But after four years in Poplar,
all I want is for our children to

29:10.660 --> 29:14.360
grow in a place with trees
and maybe no tenements.

29:15.380 --> 29:19.850
Trixie, when you marry me,
you'll be marrying the Church.

29:19.900 --> 29:22.250
Be honest, have you ever wondered

29:22.300 --> 29:25.650
whether that's really
going to suit you?

29:25.700 --> 29:27.440
No, I haven't.

29:28.340 --> 29:29.860
Have you?

29:41.940 --> 29:44.180
LAUGHTER AND MUSIC

29:46.900 --> 29:48.970
Everybody's laughing.

29:55.620 --> 29:57.930
Move! Move! Out my way!

29:57.980 --> 30:01.210
Shift it! Will you move?

30:01.260 --> 30:03.090
Move! Dora?

30:03.140 --> 30:05.850
Dora?

30:05.900 --> 30:07.450
It's me. Hello.

30:07.500 --> 30:09.040
All right?

30:09.860 --> 30:11.890
You all right?

30:11.940 --> 30:14.170
Let's get you upstairs.

30:14.220 --> 30:16.210
Come on, let's get you out of here.

30:16.260 --> 30:19.460
You should be ashamed
of yourselves! Move!

30:22.660 --> 30:27.060
♪ Sometimes, we'll sigh

30:28.380 --> 30:32.380
♪ Sometimes, we'll cry

30:35.060 --> 30:42.460
♪ And we'll know why just you
and I know true love ways. ♪

31:24.820 --> 31:28.340
WATER SPLASHES

31:29.820 --> 31:32.250
Oh!

31:32.300 --> 31:37.570
You're doing really well,
June, but do try to relax.

31:37.620 --> 31:40.530
We've plenty of time before
baby's ready to pop out.

31:40.580 --> 31:43.570
Plenty of time. You think
this is proper labour,

31:43.620 --> 31:46.010
you've got another think
coming, hasn't she, Nurse?

31:46.060 --> 31:48.940
Mrs Colter, could I have a word?

31:52.100 --> 31:54.930
I have delivered babies in
many different circumstances -

31:54.980 --> 31:57.130
routine or complicated.

31:57.180 --> 32:00.050
Now, compare your own largely
third-hand experiences

32:00.100 --> 32:02.850
and decide which of
us you trust more to

32:02.900 --> 32:07.020
help your daughter-in-law bring your
first grandchild into the world.

32:12.460 --> 32:14.370
Has she reached full term?

32:14.420 --> 32:16.820
No, she's only eight months.

32:17.700 --> 32:20.170
MUSIC AND CHATTER

32:20.220 --> 32:22.690
This way.

32:22.740 --> 32:24.660
She's upstairs.

32:30.300 --> 32:32.250
SHE MOANS IN PAIN

32:32.300 --> 32:34.540
Bridget.

32:35.660 --> 32:38.370
Sister, I'm sorry. I only
came back to check on Dora.

32:38.420 --> 32:39.930
Let's take a look at you.

32:39.980 --> 32:42.890
Bridget, this is Nurse Crane,
here to give us a bit of help.

32:42.940 --> 32:46.010
And how often are the
contractions, Miss Cole?

32:46.060 --> 32:48.860
They feel about every bloody minute!

32:54.780 --> 32:55.980
Oh!

33:07.740 --> 33:10.500
Good, strong heartbeat. Legs up.

33:19.020 --> 33:21.730
She's too advanced to move her
back to the maternity home.

33:21.780 --> 33:25.880
Bridget, we're going to have
to deliver your baby here.

33:26.620 --> 33:29.170
~ Knees down.
~ If she hasn't finished her treatment,

33:29.220 --> 33:31.850
we have to assume the syphilis
is still contagious.

33:31.900 --> 33:33.490
I'll call for Dr Turner?

33:33.540 --> 33:38.090
~ My back is killing me.
~ Well, let's get you onto
your hands and knees -

33:38.140 --> 33:41.300
~ that'll ease the pressure.
~ Ooh!
~ Here we go. There you go.
~ Oh!

33:52.980 --> 33:55.090
~ BANGS DOOR
~ Help! Is anyone there?

33:55.140 --> 33:57.010
I need a midwife!

33:59.060 --> 34:02.500
~ BANGING ON DOOR
~ I need some help!

34:04.980 --> 34:07.140
BANGING CONTINUES

34:08.219 --> 34:11.889
~ I need help!
~ Here's a knocking indeed!

34:11.940 --> 34:15.929
~ Is anyone there?
~ If a man were porter of hell-gate...

34:15.980 --> 34:19.090
~ Oh!
~ What are you about?
~ It's you!

34:19.139 --> 34:22.090
This is no night to be abroad!

34:22.139 --> 34:24.330
Can I see a midwife?

34:24.380 --> 34:26.210
Please!

34:26.260 --> 34:29.370
This is highly untoward.

34:29.420 --> 34:32.010
Why did you not utilise
the telephone?

34:32.060 --> 34:36.170
My husband took the
kids to Canvey Island

34:36.219 --> 34:40.290
and the phone on the bottom
of our street is... bust.

34:40.340 --> 34:43.370
SHE WHIMPERS IN PAIN

34:43.420 --> 34:46.610
All will be well, my dear.

34:46.659 --> 34:48.530
All will be well.

34:51.020 --> 34:53.770
I'm scared it won't be.

34:53.820 --> 34:56.330
I came cos my waters broke...

34:56.380 --> 34:58.250
and it don't look right!

34:58.300 --> 35:01.060
It was sort of...green coloured.

35:04.580 --> 35:07.210
You did well to seek assistance

35:07.260 --> 35:09.930
and it shall be obtained for you.

35:13.340 --> 35:15.540
I need a proper midwife!

35:16.420 --> 35:17.900
All abed?

35:21.980 --> 35:24.250
Will nobody attend to us?

35:25.380 --> 35:27.850
We are in need of assistance!

35:38.180 --> 35:41.330
Come with me.

35:41.380 --> 35:44.290
~ Come where?
~ To a place of safety,

35:44.340 --> 35:46.740
where you will be cared for.

35:53.820 --> 35:55.900
Argh!

35:57.220 --> 36:00.970
~ Breathe. Breathe.
~ It's never coming out!

36:01.020 --> 36:02.810
I can see the head now, Bridget.

36:02.860 --> 36:07.330
Slow and controlled pushes now,
Bridget. Slow and controlled.

36:07.380 --> 36:09.780
You're in the home straight.

36:11.940 --> 36:16.810
No more pushing now. Let me see you
blowing out those candles for me.

36:16.860 --> 36:18.600
The head's out.

36:20.740 --> 36:24.450
~ Shoulders are out. You're nearly there.
~ Argh!

36:24.500 --> 36:26.290
Urgh!

36:26.340 --> 36:29.890
BABY CRIES

36:29.940 --> 36:32.130
Well done!

36:32.180 --> 36:34.170
My baby.

36:34.220 --> 36:36.570
There she is.

36:36.620 --> 36:39.770
You have a little girl, Bridget.

36:39.820 --> 36:42.690
We need to examine her and clean her.

36:45.180 --> 36:47.380
Dr Turner's on his way.

36:55.620 --> 36:58.770
Are you sure this is the right way?

36:58.820 --> 37:02.530
You must take your lead from Lao-Tzu,

37:02.580 --> 37:05.570
the Chinese philosopher.

37:05.620 --> 37:10.450
He has it that a journey of
a thousand miles begins with

37:10.500 --> 37:12.370
a single step.

37:12.420 --> 37:15.810
This is Poplar, not bloody China!

37:15.860 --> 37:17.780
Indeed.

37:21.260 --> 37:25.690
I'm pleased to say June Colter
had a large, very sweet, baby girl

37:25.740 --> 37:28.010
without a single complication.

37:28.060 --> 37:33.490
Excellent. That's two in one day.
And how is her mother-in-law?

37:33.540 --> 37:38.090
I tried being firm with
her - it seemed to work.

37:38.140 --> 37:41.690
Mr Robbins just called - he
thinks his wife is in labour -

37:41.740 --> 37:45.210
but you've been on your
feet since breakfast.

37:45.260 --> 37:49.060
Go and alert Nurse Franklin - she
should be ready to take over.

37:53.380 --> 37:56.140
KNOCK AT DOOR

38:00.900 --> 38:04.010
Wakey-wakey!

38:04.060 --> 38:05.980
Trixie?

38:07.420 --> 38:09.180
Oh, Trixie!

38:24.860 --> 38:27.600
I'll take care of this one for you.

38:33.340 --> 38:35.050
Careful.

38:35.100 --> 38:38.170
We're in need of assistance!

38:38.220 --> 38:42.130
Sister Monica Joan! What's happened?

38:42.180 --> 38:46.570
Mrs Bowe presented herself
at Nonnatus House.

38:46.620 --> 38:48.450
Her waters broke.

38:48.500 --> 38:52.050
There was... She knew
there was a problem.

38:52.100 --> 38:55.370
You've both done exactly
the right thing.

38:55.420 --> 38:58.850
The doctor isn't here just now,

38:58.900 --> 39:03.700
but we'll get Mrs Bowe out of these
wet things and come up with a plan.

39:25.620 --> 39:28.690
Baby's heart rate is a little slow.

39:28.740 --> 39:31.170
I'm going to check
how dilated you are,

39:31.220 --> 39:35.540
~ but I think you're going to have
to have baby here and quickly.
~ No!

39:38.340 --> 39:41.220
Fortune has favoured us, Mrs Bowe.

39:42.900 --> 39:45.730
Mrs Turner has delivered
more babies than

39:45.780 --> 39:50.850
there are stars in the
Great Andromeda Nebula.

39:50.900 --> 39:55.660
We'll need a delivery pack and clean
towels from the storeroom, Sister.

39:58.580 --> 40:02.210
~ And the breathing was normal
just after the birth.
~ Yes.

40:02.260 --> 40:06.620
But now the respiration rate is over
60 and the heart rate is over 150.

40:08.860 --> 40:12.860
Baby's not pinking up
well. It's cyanosed.

40:15.620 --> 40:19.530
~ She looks so beautiful, doesn't she?
~ She does.

40:19.580 --> 40:22.330
Very beautiful.

40:22.380 --> 40:27.130
But so fragile. Oh, there can't
be anything wrong with her.

40:27.180 --> 40:29.890
Please, don't let there be!

40:29.940 --> 40:33.130
Argh!

40:33.180 --> 40:36.330
Argh! Ah!

40:36.380 --> 40:41.010
Baby's head is almost here, Eileen. I
know it stings, but just pant for me.

40:41.060 --> 40:44.090
Pant. Pant. Pant.

40:44.140 --> 40:46.730
All is well, my dear.

40:46.780 --> 40:48.730
Do as Mrs Turner says.

40:48.780 --> 40:50.450
Pant, Eileen.

40:50.500 --> 40:53.010
SHE PANTS

40:53.060 --> 40:55.970
~ Your baby's head is born, Eileen!
~ Argh!

40:56.020 --> 40:59.610
How blessed we were to
meet with Mrs Turner.

40:59.660 --> 41:02.760
How blessed I was to
meet with y... Argh!

41:05.820 --> 41:10.370
Now, I think if you can give
me one enormous brave push,

41:10.420 --> 41:15.290
we're going to be able to meet
this beautiful, beautiful baby.

41:15.340 --> 41:17.170
I can't!

41:17.220 --> 41:20.170
~ I can't!
~ Now, now.

41:20.220 --> 41:22.380
Be of good courage!

41:24.060 --> 41:27.760
~ Nurse, she's through here.
~ Thank you, Mr Robbins.

41:28.860 --> 41:32.410
You're doing really well, Susan.
Another big push for me.

41:32.460 --> 41:34.010
I can't push any more.

41:34.060 --> 41:36.200
You can. Just one more.

41:38.500 --> 41:41.290
Goodness, I can see the head, Susan!

41:41.340 --> 41:44.730
This little one's in quite a hurry
to come and say hello to you.

41:44.780 --> 41:46.650
Here come the shoulders.

41:46.700 --> 41:49.810
Oh! BABY CRIES

41:49.860 --> 41:53.220
~ There you are, little one.
~ Is it a boy?

41:57.620 --> 42:00.020
You have a very lovely baby.

42:00.980 --> 42:03.050
A beautiful daughter.

42:07.460 --> 42:10.000
Say hello to your little girl.

42:13.900 --> 42:16.010
Isn't she beautiful?

42:16.060 --> 42:17.970
Hello.

42:18.020 --> 42:20.090
That's all the hard work over.

42:20.140 --> 42:23.170
Now, we just have to
wait for the placenta.

42:23.220 --> 42:26.620
~ KNOCK ON DOOR
~ Nurse? Is everything all right?

42:30.820 --> 42:33.420
BABY CRIES

42:36.460 --> 42:40.180
Look at her. Now, wasn't she
worth all that hard work?

42:41.660 --> 42:43.650
Aren't you...?

42:43.700 --> 42:45.500
Aren't you just?

42:50.140 --> 42:53.050
~ I thought I was going to lose her.
~ No.

42:53.100 --> 42:55.810
Let us give thanks
to the Lord, our God.

42:55.860 --> 42:59.450
I'm going to have a thank
you list as long as my arm.

42:59.500 --> 43:03.530
I looked straight past you
when you opened the door -

43:03.580 --> 43:06.980
~ I shouldn't have.
~ Oh, it's no matter.

43:08.140 --> 43:11.770
I've been struggling for a
name for this little madam.

43:11.820 --> 43:13.690
Everything I liked,

43:13.740 --> 43:17.420
I heard being yelled out in the
street by somebody else's mother.

43:18.980 --> 43:22.020
I want something... special.

43:24.140 --> 43:26.020
Like er...

43:27.540 --> 43:30.050
Yours might do the trick...

43:30.100 --> 43:32.250
as long as we drop the Joan.

43:32.300 --> 43:36.130
I had an aunt called Joan
- I couldn't stand her.

43:36.180 --> 43:39.050
You're going to call the baby Monica?

43:43.820 --> 43:45.760
It is an honour...

43:48.900 --> 43:50.610
.. unearned.

43:50.660 --> 43:52.650
No, it ain't.

43:52.700 --> 43:55.300
It goes lovely with her surname.

43:56.500 --> 43:58.420
Don't it?

43:59.740 --> 44:02.660
Miss Monica Anne Bowe.

44:10.980 --> 44:14.330
I was hoping the injection of
Ergometrine would do the job,

44:14.380 --> 44:17.690
but the placenta doesn't
seem to want to come.

44:17.740 --> 44:20.290
What's happening in there?
Is everything all right?

44:20.340 --> 44:22.890
Don't tell him it's a girl, not yet,

44:22.940 --> 44:24.610
please!

44:24.660 --> 44:26.050
I won't,

44:26.100 --> 44:27.890
I promise.

44:27.940 --> 44:30.810
But I do need to speak to him, Susan.

44:37.340 --> 44:41.490
~ You need to make a telephone
call, Mr Robbins.
~ What's going on?

44:41.540 --> 44:45.660
Call Dr Turner and tell him that
your wife has a retained placenta.

44:51.460 --> 44:54.370
The ambulance will take you
to the hospital, Mrs Robbins.

44:54.420 --> 44:56.450
They'll take good care of you there.

44:56.500 --> 44:58.810
She'll be all right, won't she?

44:58.860 --> 45:00.690
They'll give her a
general anaesthetic.

45:00.740 --> 45:04.290
Everything will be easier
once she's there.

45:04.340 --> 45:06.370
And the baby?

45:06.420 --> 45:08.020
Is it a boy?

45:09.460 --> 45:11.370
Tell me, what is it?

45:11.420 --> 45:14.660
You have a very beautiful
baby daughter, Mr Robbins.

45:21.140 --> 45:24.410
Frank, please...

45:24.460 --> 45:27.730
Just look at her, at least.

45:27.780 --> 45:29.780
Frank...

45:34.740 --> 45:38.290
How could you turn your back
on your own newborn daughter?

45:38.340 --> 45:39.610
Are you listening to me?

45:39.660 --> 45:42.050
Nurse Gilbert, I'm going
to drive you home.

45:42.100 --> 45:43.930
He can't treat his wife like that!

45:43.980 --> 45:46.970
You have had a long
and exhausting day.

45:47.020 --> 45:49.650
We can collect your bicycle
in the morning.

45:49.700 --> 45:52.800
There is nothing more
for you to do here.

46:14.340 --> 46:18.610
The London called, about
booking in Mrs Robbins.

46:18.660 --> 46:22.450
They told me that you and not Nurse
Franklin were the nurse attending.

46:22.500 --> 46:26.890
~ Sorry, Sister.
~ You didn't help the problem by hiding it.

46:26.940 --> 46:29.530
APPROACHING VOICES

46:29.580 --> 46:33.130
There's no need for anyone
else to know about this.

46:33.180 --> 46:35.890
You look exhausted.

46:35.940 --> 46:38.210
Go and get some rest.

46:38.260 --> 46:41.130
I'll get Nurse Franklin into her bed.

46:42.940 --> 46:46.130
From a grand total of ten deliveries,

46:46.180 --> 46:50.770
which I'm reliably informed is
the most in one day since 1957...

46:50.820 --> 46:52.330
GASPS

46:52.380 --> 46:56.490
.. Sister Winifred delivered two.
I also delivered two - twins.

46:56.540 --> 47:00.170
Sister Julienne and Nurse
Mount only managed one each.

47:00.220 --> 47:04.450
~ GIGGLES
~ But an exhausting three babies, all girls,

47:04.500 --> 47:07.050
were brought into the
world by Nurse Gilbert.

47:07.100 --> 47:09.050
~ THEY APPLAUD
~ Oh, bravo!

47:09.100 --> 47:11.970
Not forgetting our very
own Sister Monica Joan,

47:12.020 --> 47:15.130
who so ably assisted Mrs Turner.

47:15.180 --> 47:17.170
~ Hurray!
~ Hurray! THEY APPLAUD

47:17.220 --> 47:20.330
Although, I do seem to have
forgotten Nurse Franklin.

47:20.380 --> 47:24.210
~ Where's she disappeared to now?
~ She's upstairs, resting.

47:24.260 --> 47:27.010
A little under the weather.

47:27.060 --> 47:32.380
The way Mrs Turner tells the tale,
all credit goes to you, Sister.

47:33.420 --> 47:37.970
But now, it's time everyone
went up to their beds.

47:38.020 --> 47:40.220
Tomorrow is another day.

47:48.340 --> 47:50.500
Thank you.

48:01.900 --> 48:05.810
The perineum was intact and
there was minimal blood loss.

48:05.860 --> 48:10.210
But Patrick, I was so nervous.
I still can't believe I did it.

48:10.260 --> 48:13.130
I can! You were always
the most accomplished

48:13.180 --> 48:15.210
midwife at Nonnatus House.

48:15.260 --> 48:19.450
~ Skills like that don't
just vanish when you retire.
~ I suppose not.

48:19.500 --> 48:22.770
It was as though everything
I'd ever learned or known was

48:22.820 --> 48:25.370
there at the flick of a switch.

48:25.420 --> 48:28.250
I sometimes think you're
wasted as my receptionist.

48:28.300 --> 48:29.730
No, I'm not.

48:29.780 --> 48:33.370
When I let somebody else take over
your office you were in utter

48:33.420 --> 48:35.370
chaos within weeks.

48:35.420 --> 48:39.690
There are plenty of other
midwives in the world.

48:39.740 --> 48:42.940
But I only have... one wife.

48:51.900 --> 48:54.850
This, Angela, is them
doing their mushy stuff.

48:54.900 --> 48:57.640
You really need to get used to it.

49:04.540 --> 49:08.780
I feel foolish and so selfish
for what I did last night.

49:10.420 --> 49:14.290
A few days ago, it felt like
everything was in place.

49:14.340 --> 49:18.250
I'm sure things are not as terrible
as you might feel they are.

49:18.300 --> 49:20.690
The wedding was all planned.

49:20.740 --> 49:23.900
The Bishop was delighted
with what Tom was doing.

49:25.180 --> 49:27.520
Tom's a good committed man.

49:28.500 --> 49:30.650
And what am I?

49:30.700 --> 49:34.050
Nurse Franklin, you make a great
contribution to our work -

49:34.100 --> 49:36.890
one slip cannot alter that.

49:36.940 --> 49:38.610
Perhaps he's right.

49:38.660 --> 49:41.960
Perhaps I'd never make
a good curate's wife.

49:43.100 --> 49:47.370
I'd never had a row with
him before about anything...

49:47.420 --> 49:48.960
not really.

49:50.540 --> 49:55.810
Felt like it was all
starting to fall apart.

49:55.860 --> 49:57.600
I had a drink.

49:58.540 --> 50:00.620
Then I couldn't stop.

50:03.620 --> 50:06.290
I used to hear my father
telling the whole world

50:06.340 --> 50:08.690
he didn't have a problem with drink.

50:08.740 --> 50:12.370
~ Have you spoken to Mr Hereward about this?
~ No.

50:12.420 --> 50:14.890
Please. He mustn't find out.

50:14.940 --> 50:18.010
Are you sure that's how you
want your marriage to begin -

50:18.060 --> 50:21.170
with a deception, a secret?

50:21.220 --> 50:24.860
He won't want to marry me if
he found out. What man would?

50:26.460 --> 50:28.770
Think very carefully.

50:28.820 --> 50:32.620
A secret can be a very corrosive
thing between a man and wife.

50:37.020 --> 50:39.490
She's such a beautiful thing.

50:40.740 --> 50:43.770
I can see she has Frank's eyes.

50:43.820 --> 50:47.420
When she smiles, she's
a Robbins, she really is.

50:51.060 --> 50:55.010
Oh, he's driving me mad,
him and his stupid promise.

50:55.060 --> 50:57.890
Mr Robbins lost his father
and two brothers in the war.

50:57.940 --> 51:01.250
He made a promise to their
memory that a son of his would

51:01.300 --> 51:03.090
carry on the family name.

51:03.140 --> 51:05.370
He'll come round, Susan.

51:05.420 --> 51:08.250
He's not even held her.

51:08.300 --> 51:12.530
He's hardly even looked
at her, his own daughter.

51:12.580 --> 51:16.570
Mrs Robbins, it won't do your health
any good to allow yourself to

51:16.620 --> 51:18.530
get so anxious about this.

51:18.580 --> 51:21.450
I keep looking at the suitcase
on the top of that wardrobe

51:21.500 --> 51:25.170
and I keep thinking, "Will
I come home one day to find my

51:25.220 --> 51:28.770
"things are packed and him telling
me he doesn't want to see her?"

51:28.820 --> 51:30.760
Of course he won't.

51:34.820 --> 51:37.560
I can't apologise for the Bishop...

51:38.420 --> 51:42.130
.. or his plans for a parish
for me in Newcastle.

51:42.180 --> 51:45.650
I know that, now.

51:45.700 --> 51:47.850
Then, what?

51:47.900 --> 51:53.010
~ You were right to say that
I wouldn't make a good wife.
~ I didn't say that.

51:53.060 --> 51:56.690
To be a curate's wife is
a challenging thing. I...

51:56.740 --> 51:58.940
I wanted you to be sure.

52:00.700 --> 52:02.420
And I'm not.

52:05.180 --> 52:06.780
Tom...

52:08.100 --> 52:10.410
.. the truth is,

52:10.460 --> 52:13.540
I can't live up to what you
and the Church expect of me.

52:17.500 --> 52:20.780
And so I can't keep the promise
that this ring represents.

52:25.500 --> 52:27.840
Trixie, what are you doing?

52:57.460 --> 52:59.780
Trixie...

53:03.540 --> 53:05.260
Trixie!

53:10.100 --> 53:11.970
Bridget?

53:12.020 --> 53:14.130
~ Is everything all right?
~ Oh.

53:14.180 --> 53:15.890
Look at me.

53:15.940 --> 53:18.740
I'm crying every time I look at her.

53:19.380 --> 53:21.920
She's a beautiful little girl.

53:22.380 --> 53:25.010
I'm glad to hear, so
far, she seems healthy.

53:25.060 --> 53:28.340
I am the luckiest mummy
in the world, aren't I?

53:34.060 --> 53:36.370
And when this little girl grows up?

53:36.420 --> 53:38.090
Will she follow in
the family business?

53:38.140 --> 53:41.570
Are you here to tell me off,
or to check on my baby?

53:41.620 --> 53:43.160
I'm sorry.

53:44.060 --> 53:47.610
I'm glad to hear your
treatment's working, too.

53:47.660 --> 53:50.290
I owe you a lot, Sister.

53:50.340 --> 53:51.770
Thank you.

53:51.820 --> 53:54.360
You could do something for me.

53:55.100 --> 53:59.060
You could help stop what happened
to you happening to the other girls.

54:08.660 --> 54:12.260
I'm not so fond of paperwork
either, Mr Robbins.

54:13.020 --> 54:15.050
Doctor.

54:15.100 --> 54:17.090
My wife send you?

54:17.140 --> 54:21.210
~ Did she tell you I was
being a terrible father?
~ No.

54:21.260 --> 54:24.000
I came because I'm a father myself.

54:24.460 --> 54:26.650
Good for you.

54:26.700 --> 54:28.170
Any sons?

54:29.140 --> 54:31.090
One.

54:31.140 --> 54:34.330
And I promised his mother,
before she died,

54:34.380 --> 54:36.850
I would always keep him safe.

54:39.180 --> 54:42.100
I'm sorry... for your loss...

54:43.740 --> 54:46.170
.. but this isn't your business.

54:46.220 --> 54:49.250
Last year, he was almost
taken from me...

54:49.300 --> 54:50.770
by polio.

54:51.860 --> 54:55.540
So, you see, I know a bit
about family promises.

54:56.540 --> 54:58.770
I've let my father down.

54:58.820 --> 55:01.330
By your own measure, yes.

55:01.380 --> 55:03.610
But do you really think
your father would care

55:03.660 --> 55:05.490
more for the sign above this door

55:05.540 --> 55:08.280
than the happiness of your family?

55:08.700 --> 55:10.770
About his grandchild?

55:11.620 --> 55:14.650
I needed a son...

55:14.700 --> 55:16.010
not a girl.

55:16.060 --> 55:18.600
Times are changing, Mr Robbins.

55:19.260 --> 55:22.260
There are women in
Parliament, already.

55:22.740 --> 55:25.210
By the time the two of
us are in the ground,

55:25.260 --> 55:28.000
this world will be unrecognisable.

55:31.740 --> 55:35.170
We have to be proud
of our children...

55:35.220 --> 55:37.960
and give them all the love we have.

55:40.340 --> 55:43.370
Your daughter needs you.

55:43.420 --> 55:44.960
Go to her.

55:45.780 --> 55:48.050
Be a proud father to her.

56:11.900 --> 56:14.060
BABY STIRS

56:52.340 --> 56:54.540
That's your grandfather.

56:55.180 --> 56:57.970
He taught me everything
I know about cables,

56:58.020 --> 56:59.960
yarns and hawsers.

57:00.860 --> 57:03.820
No rope, no Navy.

57:05.340 --> 57:07.280
No Navy, no Empire.

57:09.660 --> 57:13.060
My grandfather used to
say that to me when...

57:21.860 --> 57:25.300
I thought it was time to tell my daughter
how important this place is...

57:30.580 --> 57:32.520
.. for our family.

57:33.500 --> 57:36.610
Big smile, and...

57:36.660 --> 57:41.010
'The longest nights are
seldom seen approaching.

57:41.060 --> 57:44.650
'The storms may not be
heard until they break,

57:44.700 --> 57:46.610
'like life itself.

57:46.660 --> 57:50.100
'Challenges and change are
there to be confronted...

57:51.100 --> 57:55.090
'.. and we must weather
them - alone or together,

57:55.140 --> 57:57.970
'watching for the sunlight

57:58.020 --> 58:00.380
'and waiting for the dawn.'

58:08.940 --> 58:10.730
Hello.

58:10.780 --> 58:12.330
Can I help?

58:12.380 --> 58:14.290
She doesn't speak English.

58:14.340 --> 58:17.490
This is a happy day,
Sister Mary Cynthia.

58:17.540 --> 58:18.730
Welcome home.

58:18.780 --> 58:21.130
I'm not sure it's a
good idea, Patrick.

58:21.180 --> 58:23.210
You're looking terribly
tired as it is.

58:23.260 --> 58:26.090
We can help with the birth
and after - all free.

58:26.140 --> 58:28.890
Oh, sorry, can you
translate all that?

58:28.940 --> 58:30.210
Of course!

58:30.260 --> 58:33.210
It's like something you could
see after a car accident,

58:33.260 --> 58:36.460
or some other great force,
such as an assault.
