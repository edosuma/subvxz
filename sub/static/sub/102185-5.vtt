that attacked us.

when you were working
in Gotham?

39:15.440 --> 39:17.006
- I've made a few
trips there.

39:17.050 --> 39:18.573
I'm a big Knights fan.

39:18.617 --> 39:21.489
- And I called my buddy
who'd been working

39:21.533 --> 39:25.014
the Gotham beat
for more than a decade,

39:25.058 --> 39:27.756
pretty high stakes game
you played.

39:27.800 --> 39:30.193
And...

39:30.237 --> 39:33.109
There is this.

39:34.372 --> 39:36.896
So I don't know
what your goal is here,

39:36.939 --> 39:40.073
but, if you're gonna be
in my precinct--

39:40.116 --> 39:43.468
how about we cut the bull,
and you be honest with me.

39:48.603 --> 39:51.432
- Fair enough.

39:51.476 --> 39:52.825
I wasn't planning
to announce this

39:52.868 --> 39:56.350
until I got my bearings.

39:56.394 --> 39:57.917
On the orders of
the governor,

39:57.960 --> 39:59.397
I'm here to locate
and apprehend

39:59.440 --> 40:02.835
a rogue meta-human,
whatever the cost.

40:02.878 --> 40:04.706
And quite frankly,

40:04.750 --> 40:08.275
it's about time someone
address the long-standing issue

40:08.318 --> 40:11.234
this precinct ignored.

40:11.278 --> 40:13.019
- You want to arrest The Flash?

40:13.062 --> 40:15.369
- No--he's clean.

40:15.413 --> 40:17.502
So far.

40:17.545 --> 40:22.463
I'm here for someone
far more dangerous.

40:22.507 --> 40:25.597
The meta-human fugitive
known as Killer Frost.

40:28.643 --> 40:34.693
<i>♪</i>

40:39.611 --> 40:41.961
- How is he?

40:42.004 --> 40:45.225
- Better. I think.

40:45.268 --> 40:46.835
Barry's system
was overwhelmed

40:46.879 --> 40:48.097
with the same strange
signatures

40:48.141 --> 40:50.404
that I found in Nora's system.

40:50.448 --> 40:52.101
His vitals have stabilized
a bit,

40:52.145 --> 40:53.712
which is good news, but

40:53.755 --> 40:55.627
as to when
he'll be fully healed,

40:55.670 --> 40:58.107
it's difficult to say.

40:58.151 --> 41:02.111
- If Psych or Fuerza
were to attack right now,

41:02.155 --> 41:03.635
we're totally on our own.

41:03.678 --> 41:07.334
- Because I wasn't
fast enough.

41:07.377 --> 41:10.293
- Nora.
-

41:10.337 --> 41:13.253
This physical form
is new for me.

41:13.296 --> 41:16.082
I didn't know its limitations.

41:16.125 --> 41:19.302
I can feel
how weak he still is.

41:19.346 --> 41:21.827
How weak we both still are.

41:23.219 --> 41:25.178
What happened to Barry?

41:25.221 --> 41:28.398
- He was attacked by
a powerful meta-psychic.

41:28.442 --> 41:31.489
- Who showed him
his greatest fear?

41:32.577 --> 41:36.450
That same psychic was
the second of my attackers.

41:36.494 --> 41:40.367
- Fuerza and Psych?
They both hurt you?

41:40.410 --> 41:42.325
- Who are they?

41:42.369 --> 41:44.763
- I think...

41:44.806 --> 41:46.721
they're just like me.

41:46.765 --> 41:52.814

42:15.968 --> 42:17.535
