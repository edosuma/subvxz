We live on one level of existence.</i>

00:06.798 --> 00:08.300
<i>But there are others.</i>

00:08.467 --> 00:11.937
<i>These hidden dimensions
of reality are everywhere...</i>

00:12.095 --> 00:15.850
<i>...far away, across the light-years,
beneath our feet...</i>

00:16.015 --> 00:19.611
<i>...and even inside you and me.</i>

00:19.770 --> 00:23.195
<i>We are made of atoms.</i>

00:24.107 --> 00:25.780
There are more atoms in your eye...

00:25.943 --> 00:29.618
...than there are stars in all the galaxies
of the known universe.

00:34.243 --> 00:38.749
The same is true of any solid object
larger than the tip of your little finger.

00:38.914 --> 00:42.714
I'm a collection of 3
billion billion billion...

00:42.876 --> 00:46.380
...intricately arranged atoms
called Neil deGrasse Tyson.

00:46.547 --> 00:49.972
You're a similar collection
with a different name.

00:50.217 --> 00:53.812
We don't usually think of ourselves this
way, because that level of reality...

00:53.971 --> 00:56.099
...lies beyond the realm of our senses.

00:56.265 --> 00:58.814
But we're not gonna let that stop us.

00:58.976 --> 01:02.321
We can go deeper into the wonder.

Atoms let matter do funny things.

02:49.544 --> 02:52.718
To understand water, you need to know
what its atoms are doing.

02:52.881 --> 02:56.385
Every molecule of water is composed
of two tiny hydrogen atoms...

02:56.551 --> 02:58.895
...attached to a larger oxygen atom.

02:59.054 --> 03:00.931
That's why we call it H20.

03:01.932 --> 03:03.934
If it's not too hot or too cold...

03:04.101 --> 03:07.105
<i>...the molecules can slide
and tumble past each other.</i>

03:07.270 --> 03:09.318
<i>There's stickiness between the molecules...</i>

03:09.481 --> 03:12.405
<i>...but not enough to lock them
into a rigid solid.</i>

03:12.567 --> 03:15.116
That's what makes something a liquid.

03:15.278 --> 03:16.871
<i>The sun warms the water.</i>

03:17.030 --> 03:20.455
<i>And with more energy,
the molecules move faster.</i>

03:20.617 --> 03:22.460
<i>That's all that temperature is.</i>

03:22.619 --> 03:24.462
<i>Those molecules are moving fast enough...</i>

03:24.621 --> 03:27.500
<i>...to break the weak bonds
that hold them to their neighbors.</i>

03:27.666 --> 03:29.213
<i>That's evaporation.</i>

03:29.376 --> 03:33.222
<i>The air we breathe is made
of nitrogen and oxygen molecules...</i>

03:33.380 --> 03:36.975
<i>...with a scattering of water vapor
and carbon dioxide.</i>

03:37.467 --> 03:39.094
<i>Incoming!</i>

03:39.261 --> 03:41.138
<i>That's condensation.</i>

03:41.304 --> 03:43.727
<i>A dewdrop is the momentary triumph...</i>

03:43.890 --> 03:46.143
<i>...of condensation over evaporation.</i>

03:46.309 --> 03:47.777
<i>And while it lasts...</i>

03:47.936 --> 03:51.315
<i>...it's a little cosmos
with its own worlds...</i>

03:51.481 --> 03:54.325
<i>...creatures, drama.</i>

03:54.484 --> 03:57.738
<i>To explore the far-ï¬‚ung realms
of this dewdrop...</i>

03:57.904 --> 04:00.032
<i>...we're gonna need a ship.</i>

04:00.741 --> 04:02.493
<i>One with twin engines...</i>

04:02.659 --> 04:05.913
<i>...science and imagination.</i>

04:11.001 --> 04:12.799
That's a single-celled
paramecium...

04:13.503 --> 04:15.926
...one of a multitude
of skilled hunter-warriors...

04:16.089 --> 04:18.262
...that roam the dewdrop.

04:18.425 --> 04:20.769
But they too are hunted.

04:23.054 --> 04:24.351
<i>The Dileptus...</i>

04:24.514 --> 04:26.516
...the paramecium's
mortal enemy.

04:26.683 --> 04:29.653
<i>The paramecium might get lucky
and score a direct hit.</i>

04:29.811 --> 04:30.858
<i>Even if it doesn't...</i>

04:31.021 --> 04:33.365
...the recoil from the barrage
will put some distance...

04:33.523 --> 04:36.197
<i>...between the paramecium
and its attacker.</i>

04:38.779 --> 04:40.372
<i>What can I say?</i>

04:40.530 --> 04:42.157
That's life in the dewdrop.

04:54.377 --> 04:56.721
That little guy is a tardigrade...

04:57.756 --> 05:00.726
<i>...an animal smaller
than the head of a pin.</i>

05:03.220 --> 05:04.972
<i>Don't underestimate them.</i>

05:05.138 --> 05:08.483
<i>Tardigrades have been living on this planet
a lot longer than we have.</i>

05:08.642 --> 05:11.486
<i>About 500 million years.</i>

05:13.980 --> 05:15.573
<i>For every one of us...</i>

05:15.732 --> 05:19.077
<i>...there's at least a billion of them.</i>

05:22.072 --> 05:24.120
They can make a living
anywhere on Earth...

05:24.282 --> 05:26.785
...in the frigid peaks
of the tallest mountains...

05:26.952 --> 05:29.375
...in the cauldrons
of erupting volcanoes...

05:29.538 --> 05:31.836
<i>...the deep ocean vents
at the bottom of the sea.</i>

05:31.998 --> 05:33.250
<i>Tardigrades are so tough...</i>

05:33.416 --> 05:36.716
<i>...they can survive naked
in the vacuum of space.</i>

05:37.045 --> 05:38.843
They've survived all five...

05:39.005 --> 05:42.134
...of the most recent
mass extinctions on this planet.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.678
A visitor from another world
could be forgiven...

05:44.970 --> 05:48.850
...for thinking of Earth
as the planet of the tardigrades.

05:51.935 --> 05:55.781
If we're ever gonna get to the bottom
of this dewdrop, better get a move on.

05:59.109 --> 06:03.455
<i>Every leaf and tiny clump of moss
has hundreds of thousands...</i>

06:03.613 --> 06:06.457
...of microscopic mouths called stomata.

06:06.616 --> 06:09.665
Plants breathe through them,
taking in carbon dioxide...

06:09.828 --> 06:12.377
...and exhaling the oxygen
that we need to live.

06:13.123 --> 06:15.296
<i>The plants can survive without us.</i>

06:15.458 --> 06:17.051
<i>But we and all the other animals...</i>

06:17.210 --> 06:19.679
<i>...we'd be toast without them.</i>

06:20.255 --> 06:22.974
The plants make food out of sunlight.

06:23.133 --> 06:24.726
We animals can't do that.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.558
<i>To see how they do it...</i>

06:26.720 --> 06:28.188
<i>...we have to go deeper...</i>

06:28.346 --> 06:31.099
<i>...make ourselves
about a thousand times smaller...</i>

06:31.266 --> 06:33.143
<i>...to get into their treasure house...</i>

06:33.310 --> 06:37.156
<i>...the place where they keep
the good stuff, the chlorophyll.</i>

06:37.314 --> 06:41.319
<i>That's the molecule
that converts sunlight into energy.</i>

06:44.195 --> 06:46.573
<i>Every one of those rectangles
is a plant cell.</i>

06:46.740 --> 06:48.333
<i>And those tiny green vehicles...</i>

06:48.491 --> 06:51.335
<i>...are its energy factories.</i>

06:51.494 --> 06:55.965
If we could steal their trade secrets, it
would trigger a new Industrial Revolution.

06:56.166 --> 06:59.340
But to spy on them,
we're gonna need to go deeper still.

07:12.557 --> 07:17.313
<i><font color="#808080">TYSON :</font> What alien world has the Ship
of the Imagination carried us to this time?</i>

07:17.479 --> 07:19.652

07:19.814 --> 07:22.988
<i>...contained within a dewdrop.</i>

07:23.818 --> 07:26.196
<i>We're on an industrial espionage mission.</i>

07:27.197 --> 07:29.040
If we can penetrate the trade secrets...

07:29.199 --> 07:31.702
...of the manufacturing process
in that chloroplast...

07:31.868 --> 07:34.542
...let's just say our whole future
hangs in the balance.

07:35.705 --> 07:37.878
<i>This chloroplast is using sunlight...</i>

07:38.041 --> 07:42.171
<i>...to break water molecules
into atoms of hydrogen and oxygen.</i>

07:42.337 --> 07:46.012
<i>It combines the hydrogen
with carbon dioxide to make sugar...</i>

07:46.174 --> 07:48.677
<i>...and releases the oxygen
as a waste product.</i>

07:48.843 --> 07:52.063
<i>To see how it happens,
we have to go even deeper...</i>

07:52.222 --> 07:53.940
<i>...get even smaller.</i>

07:54.099 --> 07:56.852
<i>We're talking atomic scale.</i>

07:57.018 --> 07:58.144
<i>Bingo.</i>

07:58.311 --> 08:00.439
<i>This assembly line is the heart...</i>

08:00.605 --> 08:03.074
<i>...of the molecular industrial complex.</i>

08:03.233 --> 08:04.405
<i>At the molecular level...</i>

08:05.026 --> 08:07.404
<i>...things happen too fast for us to see...</i>

08:07.570 --> 08:11.074
<i>...so we'll have to slow them down
about a billion times.</i>

08:14.285 --> 08:16.708
<i>Those larger molecules are carbon dioxide.</i>

08:16.871 --> 08:20.216
<i>Each one of them is made
of one carbon and two oxygen atoms.</i>

08:20.375 --> 08:23.094
<i>When sunlight strikes
a green molecule of chlorophyll...</i>

08:23.253 --> 08:26.052
<i>...it sets in motion a series
of chemical reactions...</i>

08:26.214 --> 08:27.932
<i>...breaking apart water molecules...</i>

08:28.091 --> 08:31.015
<i>...and freeing energetic electrons.</i>

08:32.554 --> 08:34.101
<i>And that's just the day shift...</i>

08:34.264 --> 08:37.234
<i>...when sunlight supplies
the incoming stream of energy.</i>

08:37.600 --> 08:40.274
<i>There's a second shift
that works day and night...</i>

08:40.437 --> 08:43.691
<i>...using the solar energy kept in reserve.</i>

08:44.858 --> 08:47.202
<i>The energy of the free electrons
is put to work...</i>

08:47.360 --> 08:51.206
<i>...combining carbon dioxide
with hydrogen from the water.</i>

08:51.364 --> 08:53.492
<i>The end product is sugar...</i>

08:53.658 --> 08:56.286
<i>...which stores the solar energy.</i>

08:56.619 --> 09:01.716
<i>The chloroplast is a 3-billion-year-old
solar energy collector.</i>

09:01.875 --> 09:04.128
<i>This submicroscopic solar battery...</i>

09:04.294 --> 09:07.389
<i>...is what drives all the forests
and the fields...</i>

09:07.547 --> 09:09.515
<i>...and the plankton of the seas...</i>

09:09.674 --> 09:12.974
<i>...and the animals, including us.</i>

09:13.136 --> 09:16.686
<i>The solar-powered biosphere
collects and processes...</i>

09:16.848 --> 09:20.728
<i>...six times more power
than our entire civilization.</i>

09:20.894 --> 09:24.319
<i>We understand on a chemical level
how photosynthesis works.</i>

09:24.481 --> 09:27.155
<i>We can re-create the process
in a laboratory...</i>

09:27.317 --> 09:29.991
<i>...but we're not as good
at it as plants are.</i>

09:30.153 --> 09:31.370
<i>And that's not surprising...</i>

09:31.529 --> 09:34.578
<i>...considering nature's been at this
for billions of years...</i>

09:34.741 --> 09:36.288
<i>...and we've only just started.</i>

09:36.451 --> 09:40.081
<i>But if we could figure out
the trade secrets of photosynthesis...</i>

09:40.246 --> 09:43.841
<i>...every other source of energy
we depend on today...</i>

09:44.000 --> 09:46.628
...coal, oil, natural gas...

09:46.795 --> 09:48.843
<i>...would become obsolete.</i>

09:49.005 --> 09:52.225
<i>Photosynthesis is the ultimate green power.</i>

09:52.383 --> 09:53.805
<i>It doesn't pollute the air...</i>

09:53.968 --> 09:55.936
<i>...and is, in fact, carbon neutral.</i>

09:56.096 --> 09:58.383
<i>Artificial photosynthesis,
on a big enough</i>

09:58.395 --> 10:00.693
<i>scale, could reduce the
greenhouse effect...</i>

10:00.850 --> 10:04.104
<i>...that's driving climate change
in a dangerous direction.</i>

10:04.854 --> 10:08.700
Uh-oh. Place is evaporating.
Time to get out of here.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.538
How fleeting is the life of a dewdrop.

10:13.696 --> 10:16.495
It condenses from thin air
in the cool of the night...

10:16.658 --> 10:19.127
...only to vanish with the heat
of the day.

10:19.285 --> 10:22.038
And what of its inhabitants,
the tardigrades?

10:22.205 --> 10:23.422
They'll be fine.

10:23.581 --> 10:25.379
They can go without water for years.

10:27.794 --> 10:31.298
<i><font color="#808080">TYSON :</font> It's hard to imagine, but plants
covered the surface of the Earth...</i>

10:31.464 --> 10:33.558

10:33.716 --> 10:36.515
<i>...before they put forth

10:36.803 --> 10:39.477

10:49.816 --> 10:53.912

10:54.070 --> 10:56.414

10:56.573 --> 10:59.372
...or the crimson of a red, red rose.

11:06.833 --> 11:11.384
<i>Orchids were among the first
flowering species to appear on Earth...</i>

11:11.546 --> 11:13.924
<i>...and they're the most diverse.</i>

11:15.633 --> 11:20.104
<i>Darwin was particularly fascinated
by the comet orchid of Madagascar...</i>

11:20.263 --> 11:23.107
<i>...a flower whose pollen is hidden
at the bottom...</i>

11:23.266 --> 11:26.736
<i>...of a very long, thin spur.</i>

11:28.062 --> 11:32.283
<i>There can be no stronger test
of an idea than its predictive power.</i>

11:32.442 --> 11:35.616
<i>On the basis of his theory of evolution
through natural selection...</i>

11:35.778 --> 11:39.828
<i>...Darwin speculated that somewhere
on the island of Madagascar...</i>

11:39.991 --> 11:42.119
<i>...there must live flying insects...</i>

11:42.285 --> 11:45.004
<i>...with extraordinarily lengthy tongues. ..</i>

11:45.163 --> 11:47.757
<i>...ones long enough to reach the pollen.</i>

11:47.916 --> 11:50.635
<i>No one had ever seen such a beast there...</i>

11:50.793 --> 11:55.594
<i>...but Darwin insisted that an animal
fitting this description must exist.</i>

11:55.757 --> 11:58.226
<i>Few people at the time believed him.</i>

11:58.384 --> 12:01.137
<i>It wasn't until more than 50 years later...</i>

12:01.304 --> 12:03.306
<i>...that Darwin was proven right.</i>

12:04.307 --> 12:09.029
<i>In 1903, a huge hawk moth
called the Morgan's sphinx...</i>

12:09.187 --> 12:11.565
<i>...was discovered in Madagascar.</i>

12:11.731 --> 12:14.075
<i>Attracted by the comet orchid's scent...</i>

12:14.234 --> 12:18.080
<i>...the moth slurps its pollen
with its foot-long tongue...</i>

12:18.238 --> 12:20.957
<i>...exactly as Darwin expected it would.</i>

12:25.787 --> 12:29.337
<i>It's even more amazing
that the Morgan's sphinx was discovered...</i>

12:29.499 --> 12:32.844
<i>...when you consider that more than
90 percent of Madagascar's rain forests...</i>

12:33.002 --> 12:35.004
<i>...have been destroyed.</i>

12:35.171 --> 12:37.515
<i>In the years
since Darwin's famous prediction...</i>

12:38.007 --> 12:42.683
<i>...this moth species could have easily
become extinct with all the others...</i>

12:42.845 --> 12:46.816
<i>...every one of them a unique phrase

12:56.734 --> 12:59.112
Ah, the fragrance of lilacs.

12:59.279 --> 13:03.500
It's one of those scents that triggers
a whole constellation of associations...

13:03.658 --> 13:06.628
...all those Junes of long ago.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.129
But how does that happen?

13:08.288 --> 13:12.043
How does a smell prompt a movie
to start running in your head?

13:12.208 --> 13:13.926
It's not something we can see.

13:14.085 --> 13:16.713
Could it be a wave of energy, like light?

13:16.879 --> 13:19.678
Or is it some kind of microscopic particle?

13:19.841 --> 13:21.309
It's actually a molecule.

13:21.801 --> 13:26.477
Every odor we can sense, whether it
comes from burnt toast, gasoline...

13:26.639 --> 13:28.892
...or a field of lilacs...

13:29.058 --> 13:30.901
...it's a cloud of molecules.

13:31.769 --> 13:35.319
These molecules have particular shapes.

13:35.481 --> 13:36.528
<i>When I inhale them...</i>

13:36.691 --> 13:40.946
<i>...they stimulate a particular set
of receptor cells in my nose.</i>

13:41.821 --> 13:44.574
<i>An electrical signal then
travels to my brain...</i>

13:44.741 --> 13:48.416
<i>...which identifies this scent as lilac.</i>

13:51.456 --> 13:55.506
<i>Other scents are carried by different
molecules with different shapes.</i>

<i>The network of neurons

<i>...over hundreds of millions
of years of evolution.</i>

14:52.016 --> 14:53.609

27:53.088 --> 27:54.931
<i>The deeper we go into the sun...</i>

27:55.090 --> 27:58.970
<i>...the greater the squeezing
and the higher the temperature.</i>

27:59.136 --> 28:00.558
<i>In the heart of the sun...</i>

28:00.721 --> 28:05.192
<i>...the atoms are moving so fast
that when they collide, they fuse.</i>

28:05.350 --> 28:07.819
<i>Their nuclei touch.</i>

28:08.896 --> 28:11.820
<i>The sun is a nuclear fusion reactor...</i>

28:11.982 --> 28:14.235
<i>...held together by its own gravity.</i>

28:14.401 --> 28:17.621
<i>It's balanced between
the inward pull of gravity...</i>

28:17.779 --> 28:21.283
<i>...and the outward push of its hot gases.</i>

28:24.244 --> 28:27.168
That balance has lasted
billions of years...

28:27.331 --> 28:30.926
...providing stability that made possible
the evolution of life on Earth.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.337
In the sun's core...

28:33.503 --> 28:35.955
...the fusion of hydrogen
into helium releases

28:35.967 --> 28:38.430
nuclear energy in the
form of photons.

28:38.592 --> 28:41.971
These particles of light
slowly work their way to the surface...

28:42.137 --> 28:44.139
...where they're seen as sunlight.

28:44.306 --> 28:47.651
Helium is the ash
of the sun's nuclear furnace.

28:49.686 --> 28:51.688
The sun is a medium-sized star.

28:51.855 --> 28:55.155
Its core is only a lukewarm
10 million degrees.

28:55.317 --> 28:58.491
Hot enough to fuse hydrogen,
but too cold to fuse helium.

28:59.446 --> 29:02.199
There are many stars in the galaxy
that get much hotter...

29:02.366 --> 29:05.620
...because they're more massive
and have more gravity.

29:05.786 --> 29:11.008
<i>Such stars fuse helium into heavier
elements, like carbon and oxygen.</i>

29:11.166 --> 29:15.342
<i>In their old age, they gently
diffuse these elements into space.</i>

29:17.756 --> 29:22.011
Other stars, more massive yet,
live fast and die young...

29:22.177 --> 29:24.305
...in cataclysmic supernova
explosions.

29:24.972 --> 29:28.943
In our galaxy, such stars
go supernova about once a century.

29:30.686 --> 29:34.611
<i>Those explosions are far hotter
than the core of the sun.</i>

29:34.773 --> 29:39.449
<i>Hot enough to transform elements like
iron into all the heavier ones...</i>

29:39.611 --> 29:42.490
<i>...and spew them into space.</i>

29:42.656 --> 29:44.078
The Large Magellanic Cloud...

29:44.241 --> 29:46.619
...is a neighboring galaxy
of our Milky Way.

29:46.785 --> 29:49.208
It's visible in the skies
of the southern hemisphere.

29:49.913 --> 29:51.881
When a supernova explodes...

29:52.040 --> 29:56.216
...its brightness rivals that
of its entire galaxy.

30:06.847 --> 30:12.320
But all that light is only about 1 percent
of the energy liberated in the explosion.

30:12.477 --> 30:15.356
The rest of the energy is carried off
by the most common...

30:15.522 --> 30:18.321
...and the most mysterious particles
in the cosmos.

30:18.483 --> 30:21.202
There are trillions of them
passing through you right now.

30:21.361 --> 30:23.784
And yet tracking down
even one of them...

30:23.947 --> 30:27.417
...will take us to one of
the strangest places on Earth.

30:36.918 --> 30:40.968
<font color="#808080">TYSON :</font> Stalking the wild
neutrino is the rarest of sport.

30:41.131 --> 30:45.102
The lengths one must go to track them down
is nothing short of astonishing.

30:46.178 --> 30:48.897
Welcome to Super-Kamioka...

30:49.056 --> 30:52.560
...the subterranean Japanese
neutrino-detection chamber...

30:52.726 --> 30:55.525
...more than a half mile
beneath Earth's surface.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.860
You might ask,
"Well, who in their right mind...

30:58.023 --> 31:01.243
...would bury an astronomical observatory
so far underground?"

31:01.443 --> 31:04.788
Those who hunt the most elusive prey
in the cosmos:

31:05.280 --> 31:06.532
the neutrino.

31:06.698 --> 31:09.360
This enormous array
of light detectors

31:09.372 --> 31:12.046
surrounding 50,000 tons
of distilled water...

31:12.204 --> 31:15.378
...is a trap designed to
catch neutrinos only.

31:15.707 --> 31:17.960
Other particles, such as cosmic rays...

31:18.126 --> 31:21.050
...mostly protons and electrons
that rain down from space...

31:21.213 --> 31:24.012
...cannot get through all that rock
above us.

31:24.174 --> 31:26.802
But matter poses no obstacle
to a neutrino.

31:27.511 --> 31:30.401
A neutrino could pass
through a hundred

31:30.413 --> 31:33.314
light-years of steel
without even slowing down.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.944
Neutrinos hardly interact
with matter at all.

31:36.103 --> 31:39.323
That's why you need so much of it
to catch even one of them.

31:39.564 --> 31:40.611
On those rare occasions...

31:40.774 --> 31:44.529
...when a neutrino actually does collide
with a particle of ordinary matter...

31:44.694 --> 31:48.415
...it produces a ghostly
ring-shaped flash of light.

31:49.032 --> 31:54.380
We're lying in wait for a particle
that weighs next to nothing.

31:54.538 --> 31:56.415
Even the miniscule electron...

31:56.581 --> 31:59.835
...has more than a million times its mass.

32:00.001 --> 32:01.503
There!

32:01.878 --> 32:05.974
When the supernova in the Large
Magellanic Cloud blew its top in 1987...

32:06.133 --> 32:08.636
...this is what it would have looked like
in here.

32:08.802 --> 32:12.181
Now remember, the Large Magellanic
Cloud is in our southern hemisphere...

32:12.347 --> 32:15.772
...so the neutrinos didn't come through
that half-mile of rock above us.

32:15.934 --> 32:19.529
They had to pass through the thousands
of miles of rock and iron below us...

32:19.688 --> 32:21.315
...to reach this detector.

32:21.481 --> 32:22.653
But the coolest thing...

32:22.816 --> 32:24.784
...was that those neutrinos hit Earth...

32:24.943 --> 32:28.538
...three hours before
the light from the supernova did.

32:28.697 --> 32:30.870
If nothing can travel faster than light...

32:31.032 --> 32:33.831
...how could that possibly be?

32:39.332 --> 32:42.552
<i>This is a dead star walking.</i>

32:42.711 --> 32:47.683
<i>It may look normal, but deep within it,
something cataclysmic is happening.</i>

32:47.841 --> 32:50.014
<i>This blue supergiant star...</i>

32:50.177 --> 32:54.557
<i>...has already begun to explode inside.</i>

32:58.477 --> 33:01.105
<i>Like rats deserting a sinking ship...</i>

33:01.271 --> 33:04.366
<i>...the neutrinos produced in the heart
of the exploding star...</i>

33:04.524 --> 33:06.947
<i>...race outward at near
the speed of light...</i>

33:07.110 --> 33:10.865
<i>...through the overlying mass
in only a few seconds.</i>

33:11.031 --> 33:16.003
<i>But the shock wave of the exploding gas
plods along from the center of the star...</i>

33:16.161 --> 33:19.631
<i>...at one ten-thousandth
the speed of light...</i>

33:19.831 --> 33:22.334
...until it finally reaches
the star's surface...

33:22.501 --> 33:26.256
...turning it into Supernova 1987A.

33:32.511 --> 33:34.462
It took hours for the
explosion to reach the

33:34.474 --> 33:36.436
surface of the star and
blow it wide-open...

33:36.598 --> 33:38.726
...exposing the superhot core.

33:38.892 --> 33:41.941
The neutrinos had
an insurmountable head start.

33:42.103 --> 33:44.680
That's why the flash of
light arrived on Earth

33:44.692 --> 33:47.280
so much later than the
shower of neutrinos.

33:47.609 --> 33:51.364
Before anyone had ever snared
the wild neutrino...

33:51.530 --> 33:55.626
...it existed in the mind
of a theoretical physicist.

33:56.117 --> 34:00.372
Just as Charles Darwin knew there must be
an extremely long-nosed creature...

34:00.539 --> 34:02.917
...flying around somewhere
in Madagascar...

34:03.083 --> 34:07.384
...a 20th-century physicist
named Wolfgang Pauli...

34:09.297 --> 34:11.583
...was desperately
seeking a particle to

34:11.596 --> 34:13.893
rescue one of the pillars
of modern physics.

34:14.052 --> 34:16.896
The law of the conservation
of energy.

34:26.063 --> 34:27.690
So why didn't I flinch?

34:27.857 --> 34:30.076
Because the laws of science
differ fundamentally...

34:30.235 --> 34:32.487
...from those of
other human endeavors.

34:32.654 --> 34:35.373
In order for an idea
to become a scientific law...

34:35.532 --> 34:37.784
...it has to be unbreakable.

34:37.951 --> 34:42.956
That's why I was willing to bet this face
on the laws of conservation of energy.

34:43.748 --> 34:45.876
Now, if you try this at home...

34:46.042 --> 34:48.420
...take care not to give
the cannonball a push.

34:48.587 --> 34:49.839
That's adding energy...

34:50.005 --> 34:52.884
...and the ball will surely
come back and do some damage.

34:53.049 --> 34:56.349
You just have to let it go, like this:

34:56.969 --> 34:58.017
By lifting the ball...

34:58.179 --> 35:00.022
...you give it gravitational energy...

35:00.181 --> 35:02.855
...which is the potential
to fall and accelerate.

35:03.310 --> 35:06.530
The Cannonball is going fastest
when it's at the bottom of its arc.

35:06.688 --> 35:09.225
At that moment, it's
converted all of its

35:09.237 --> 35:11.785
gravitational energy to
the energy of motion.

35:11.943 --> 35:13.035
<i>As it swings...</i>

35:13.194 --> 35:15.270
<i>...the cannonball is
constantly exchanging one</i>

35:15.282 --> 35:17.370
<i>of these two kinds of
energy for the other.</i>

35:17.532 --> 35:20.206
<i>But the total amount of energy
remains constant.</i>

35:20.368 --> 35:24.248
That's an example
of the law of conservation of energy.

35:24.414 --> 35:26.166
Once the cannonball is released...

35:26.333 --> 35:29.712
...it can never gain more energy
than it had to begin with.

35:29.878 --> 35:32.882
It has no way to fly up
and break my nose.

35:33.048 --> 35:36.769
The energy accounting books
are always strictly balanced.

35:36.926 --> 35:38.849
There's no such thing as cheating.

35:39.012 --> 35:40.514
So in the 20th century...

35:40.680 --> 35:44.230
...when physicists first calculated
the energy of atoms precisely...

35:44.392 --> 35:48.898
...they were startled to discover
an apparent violation of this law.

35:50.065 --> 35:52.659
They found that
in some radioactive atoms...

35:52.817 --> 35:56.742
...the nucleus can spontaneously
eject an electron.

35:56.905 --> 36:00.079
This transforms the atom
into a different element.

36:00.241 --> 36:02.243
The physicists were mystified.

36:02.410 --> 36:06.210
The energy of the escaped electron
plus that of the new element...

36:06.373 --> 36:09.422
...adds up to less than the energy
in the original nucleus.

36:09.834 --> 36:14.635
But the law says, "Thou shalt not
destroy or create energy."

36:14.798 --> 36:17.176
So where did the missing energy go?

36:17.759 --> 36:24.187
In 1930, Wolfgang Pauli predicted
there must be an undiscovered particle.

36:24.349 --> 36:27.068
One that makes off
with the missing energy.

36:27.227 --> 36:28.274
At the time...

36:28.436 --> 36:31.536
...Pauli lamented that
such a phantom particle

36:31.548 --> 36:34.660
might be so minute,
swift and evasive...

36:34.818 --> 36:37.788
...as to forever defy detection.

36:37.946 --> 36:41.746
But that was a rare failure
of his imagination.

36:41.908 --> 36:45.287
Because science is always searching
for a way to go deeper still.

36:45.620 --> 36:46.872
A generation later...

36:47.038 --> 36:50.042
...Pauli's neutrinos were actually
detected for the first time...

36:50.208 --> 36:52.711
...in radiation from a nuclear reactor.

36:52.877 --> 36:57.223
And we've been finding them,
with difficulty, ever since.

36:57.632 --> 36:59.054
There are scientists today...

36:59.217 --> 37:02.687
...who are trying to find a way
to ride those neutrinos...

37:02.846 --> 37:05.816
...all the way back
to the beginning of time.

37:07.434 --> 37:13.692
We'll go as far as they have gone
to come up against the wall of forever.

37:22.657 --> 37:25.126
<i><font color="#808080">TYSON :</font>
The wall of forever is nothing new.</i>

37:25.285 --> 37:30.792
<i>Our ancestors came up against it almost
as soon as they first started imagining it.</i>

37:30.957 --> 37:34.928
<i>A million dawns ago,
in the 13th century BC...</i>

37:35.086 --> 37:37.965
<i>...the Egyptians built this temple
at Abu Simbel...</i>

37:38.131 --> 37:43.683
<i>...to honor the pharaoh Ramses II,
depicted here in four colossal statues.</i>

37:44.304 --> 37:46.648
<i>Reigning even above this mighty king...</i>

37:46.806 --> 37:51.653
<i>...is the falcon-headed Ra-Harakhte,
god of the sun.</i>

37:56.941 --> 38:00.286
<i>The temple was designed
so that the light from the rising sun...</i>

38:00.445 --> 38:04.541
<i>...could only enter the sanctuary
on two days every year.</i>

38:05.909 --> 38:07.536
<i>As the rays enter the temple...</i>

38:07.702 --> 38:11.206
<i>...they burnish the statues of the gods
with their golden light...</i>

38:11.372 --> 38:14.546
<i>...before penetrating the sanctuary.</i>

38:15.376 --> 38:19.222
<i>Even then, one god remains in shadow...</i>

38:19.380 --> 38:21.929
<i>...Ptah, lord of creation...</i>

38:22.091 --> 38:26.847
<i>...as if the origin of the universe
must forever be concealed.</i>

38:31.267 --> 38:34.567
<i>Feel the sun on your face.</i>

38:34.729 --> 38:39.701
<i>The energy that warms you began its
journey some 10 million years ago...</i>

38:39.859 --> 38:42.112
<i>...in the heart of the sun.</i>

38:43.738 --> 38:45.115
<i>Unlike neutrinos...</i>

38:45.281 --> 38:49.161
...the photons needed that long to work
their way out from the core to the surface.

38:50.370 --> 38:55.752
Why? Because they were colliding billions
of times per second with the sun's atoms...

38:55.917 --> 38:59.512
...every collision sending them off
in a random direction.

38:59.671 --> 39:01.924
Once they finally reached the surface...

39:02.090 --> 39:05.594
...they were free to dash nonstop
at the speed of light...

39:05.927 --> 39:09.602
...in a mere eight minutes
and 2O seconds from the sun to you.

39:11.599 --> 39:15.775
<i>Ten-million-year-old light on your face.</i>

39:17.897 --> 39:22.573
What was happening
when that light left the heart of the sun?

39:28.825 --> 39:31.464
The cosmic calendar
compresses the entire

39:31.476 --> 39:34.127
13.8-billion-year history
of the universe...

39:34.289 --> 39:35.916
...into a single year.

39:36.082 --> 39:38.961
Every month represents
about a billion years.

39:39.127 --> 39:42.097
Every day, about 40 million years.

39:42.255 --> 39:45.304
The universe is so old
that on the cosmic calendar...

39:45.466 --> 39:48.936
...10 million years ago
only takes us back as far as...

39:49.637 --> 39:55.485
...6 p.m. on the last evening
of the last day of the year.

39:55.643 --> 39:57.145
And what about us?

39:57.312 --> 39:59.406
Humans had yet to evolve.

39:59.564 --> 40:00.907
Ten million years ago...

40:01.065 --> 40:03.067
...our ancestors were anthropoid apes...

40:03.234 --> 40:05.657
...swinging through the trees of Africa.

40:05.820 --> 40:08.824
To us, 10 million years
seems like a long time...

40:08.990 --> 40:14.463
...but it's only the length of an afternoon
on the timescale of the cosmos.

40:17.248 --> 40:22.345
The sun began fusing hydrogen
4500 million years ago.

40:22.503 --> 40:25.507
August 31st on the cosmic calendar.

40:25.840 --> 40:30.687
<i>Our Milky Way Galaxy
is about 10,000 million years old.</i>

40:30.845 --> 40:35.225
The first galaxies
formed a few billion years earlier.

40:35.934 --> 40:39.689
And something keeps me from going
any further back in time.

40:40.313 --> 40:42.361
What is this?

40:45.526 --> 40:48.075
It's the nature of light and time.

40:48.237 --> 40:51.036
Because light travels at a finite speed...

40:51.199 --> 40:52.701
...to look across space...

40:52.867 --> 40:55.541
...is to look back in time.

40:58.581 --> 41:03.382
So the farther we see,
the older the light.

41:03.920 --> 41:08.847
This is as far back in the history
of the cosmos as we can see with light.

41:09.008 --> 41:13.730
It's a baby picture of the universe
when it was only 380,000 years old.

41:14.305 --> 41:19.482
That's 15 minutes into January 1st
on the cosmic calendar.

41:20.061 --> 41:24.737
If we look as far as we can see in any
direction using microwave telescopes...

41:24.899 --> 41:26.572
...this is what we see...

41:26.734 --> 41:29.408
...the glow left over from the Big Bang.

41:29.570 --> 41:33.200
Imagine that all the matter and energy
of the observable universe...

41:33.366 --> 41:37.837
...was concentrated into something
no larger than this.

41:39.455 --> 41:41.583
That's the size of the universe...

41:41.749 --> 41:47.427
...when it was a trillionth of a trillionth
of a trillionth of a second old.

41:47.588 --> 41:50.558
All the matter and energy
of the hundred billion galaxies...

41:50.717 --> 41:54.062
...now splayed out across
the billions of light-years...

41:54.220 --> 41:58.726
...were once pent up
in something the size of a marble.

41:58.891 --> 42:01.770
Can you imagine how tightly packed
that marble must have been?

42:01.936 --> 42:04.940
Far too dense for any kind of light
to move through it...

42:05.106 --> 42:08.485
...but no obstacle for the likes
of neutrinos.

42:08.651 --> 42:11.825
The Big Bang must have produced
stupendous numbers of neutrinos...

42:11.988 --> 42:15.788
...which flew unhindered through
that inconceivable crush of matter.

42:15.950 --> 42:18.999
The very thing that makes them
almost impossible to detect...

42:19.162 --> 42:22.364
...is what allows neutrinos
to sail through the

42:22.376 --> 42:25.590
curtain that conceals
the beginning of time.

42:25.752 --> 42:26.844
Where are they now?

42:27.003 --> 42:30.678
They're here, they're there,
everywhere throughout the universe.

42:30.840 --> 42:34.470
Neutrinos from creation
are within you.

42:34.802 --> 42:39.148
From a marble to the cosmos.

42:49.692 --> 42:55.540
<i>This is the road that Thales and Democritus
put us on some 2500 years ago.</i>

42:55.698 --> 42:57.746
<i>A road of endless searching.</i>

42:57.909 --> 43:01.163
<i>A relentless, systematic hunt
for new worlds...</i>

43:01.329 --> 43:04.959
<i>...and an ever-deepening
understanding of nature.</i>

43:05.458 --> 43:12.467
<i>Who among you will pick up that torch
and take us down that next stretch of road?</i>
