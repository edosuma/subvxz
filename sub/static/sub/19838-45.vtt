00:05.370 --> 00:09.500
<b>Leol has chased Morel into 
an underground church,</b>

00:09.500 --> 00:11.720
<b>where they will now fight one another.</b>

00:19.350 --> 00:22.500
<b>This ability only activates when it rains.</b>

00:22.740 --> 00:24.070
<b><i>Inamura!</i></b>

02:01.970 --> 02:06.980
<b>Return x And x Retire</b>

02:12.630 --> 02:14.860
<b>My Inamura</b>

02:15.210 --> 02:16.870
<b>summons waves!</b>

02:23.190 --> 02:27.030
<b>Well? Aren't my big waves rad?</b>

02:28.370 --> 02:31.750
<b>I can easily wash away your wimpy smoke!</b>

02:41.720 --> 02:43.930
<b>You're having trouble moving 
in the water, right?</b>

02:45.630 --> 02:49.380
<b>You like how easily my board can maneuver?</b>

02:49.380 --> 02:52.190
<b>If you stand still, I'll give you a quick death.</b>

02:52.580 --> 02:54.440
<b>That's not your ability.</b>

02:56.190 --> 02:58.120
<b>It belongs</b>

02:58.680 --> 03:00.070
<b>to my buddy!</b>

03:07.340 --> 03:09.710
<b><i>Oh, making a boat of smoke?</i></b>

03:10.750 --> 03:13.380
<b><i>So he can stand on that smoke?</i></b>

03:18.580 --> 03:21.550
<b>You think that's enough to defeat my waves?</b>

03:21.700 --> 03:25.190
<b>I told you, that's not your ability!</b>

03:29.680 --> 03:33.060
<b>This one is my own original...</b>

03:44.460 --> 03:46.160
<b><i>Tornave!</i></b>

03:44.930 --> 03:47.220
<b>Maelstrom!!
Tornave</b>

04:02.240 --> 04:03.720
<b><i>The current's so strong...</i></b>

04:04.060 --> 04:05.890
<b><i>I can't tell up from down.</i></b>

04:06.310 --> 04:07.290
<b><i>This is bad.</i></b>

04:07.980 --> 04:10.570
<b><i>I can't control my body at all...</i></b>

04:12.220 --> 04:15.730
<b><i>I stop my opponent's 
movements with a whirlpool.</i></b>

04:16.340 --> 04:17.230
<b>Here I go!</b>

04:17.980 --> 04:20.730
<b><i>Then, I finish him with a harpoon from above!</i></b>

04:22.110 --> 04:25.760
<b><i>My harpoon can match the speed of sound,</i></b>

04:25.760 --> 04:30.060
<b><i>and pierce a whale at the very bottom 
of the ocean, even from the sky!</i></b>

04:30.060 --> 04:31.470
<b>Take this!</b>

04:33.750 --> 04:35.920
<b><i>He disappeared?</i></b>

04:40.530 --> 04:41.730
<b><i>Impossible!</i></b>

04:41.730 --> 04:44.400
<b><i>The whirlpool should have incapacitated him.</i></b>

04:45.400 --> 04:47.380
<b><i>He had no way to escape.</i></b>

04:53.140 --> 04:54.690
<b>Bastard...</b>

04:55.260 --> 04:56.690
<b>How did you do it?</b>

04:58.180 --> 05:00.690
<b>I simply exhaled.</b>

05:01.840 --> 05:06.150
<b>When it comes to lung capacity, 
no one in the world beats me.</b>

05:07.550 --> 05:12.700
<b><i>He used his breath as jet propulsion 
to break out of the whirlpool?</i></b>

05:14.230 --> 05:17.460
<b>Okay, it's my turn now!</b>

05:18.040 --> 05:20.440
<b>It's your turn?</b>

05:20.840 --> 05:25.330
<b>In this battle, you don't get a turn!</b>

05:25.330 --> 05:28.090
<b>All you get to do is drown in my waves!</b>

05:28.450 --> 05:32.090
<b>During this exchange, I've learned three things.</b>

05:34.420 --> 05:36.320
<b>First, I now know your power.</b>

05:36.960 --> 05:40.740
<b>Somehow, you're able to use 
other people's abilities.</b>

05:41.410 --> 05:42.980
<b>And those earphones</b>

05:44.020 --> 05:46.850
<b>have nothing to do with your power.</b>

05:46.850 --> 05:49.210
<b>They're either for show or for luck.</b>

05:50.280 --> 05:53.210
<b>Or it means someone is sending you orders.</b>

05:55.910 --> 06:00.950
<b><i>If he meant to impair his hearing 
to strengthen his power,</i></b>

06:01.300 --> 06:04.050
<b><i>he shouldn't be able to hear me talk.</i></b>

06:06.200 --> 06:07.760
<b>What's the third thing?</b>

06:07.970 --> 06:10.000
<b>Your lifespan.</b>

06:10.000 --> 06:13.760
<b>That Inamura ability belongs 
to a Hunter named Grachan.</b>

06:15.250 --> 06:18.870
<b>You probably encountered and defeated 
him when he was sent</b>

06:18.870 --> 06:20.250
<b>to fight the Chimera Ants.</b>

06:20.600 --> 06:24.530
<b>I'll punish you for stealing my buddy's ability!</b>

06:25.380 --> 06:28.280
<b>Your life ends today!</b>

06:29.070 --> 06:30.340
<b>Hold on...</b>

06:30.340 --> 06:32.540
<b>That's a totally one-sided misinterpretation.</b>

06:32.900 --> 06:36.450
<b>I was protecting myself from humans 
who were hunting me down.</b>

06:36.450 --> 06:38.790
<b>It was self-defense.</b>

06:39.240 --> 06:42.780
<b>And I didn't steal his ability.</b>

06:43.660 --> 06:45.550
<b>I'm just borrowing it for a bit.</b>

06:46.270 --> 06:49.020
<b>Just borrowing it for a bit?</b>

06:49.790 --> 06:53.280
<b>That's an excuse thieves use.</b>

06:55.460 --> 06:59.310
<b>Well, arguing with you is pointless.</b>

06:59.830 --> 07:02.430
<b><i>I'd like to get my hands on his ability,</i></b>

07:02.430 --> 07:05.070
<b><i>but defeating him is more important.</i></b>

07:05.650 --> 07:10.860
<b>Right now, our top priority 
is to defeat one another.</b>

07:12.490 --> 07:13.830
<b>I'll repeat myself...</b>

07:14.390 --> 07:17.400
<b>I'm sorry, but you don't get a turn!</b>

07:19.260 --> 07:22.340
<b><i>Big Wall!</i></b>

07:19.660 --> 07:21.710
<b>Giant Wave
Big Wall</b>

07:26.720 --> 07:29.150
<b>I'm flooding this underground church.</b>

07:29.150 --> 07:31.680
<b>My wall of water's gonna suck you in!</b>

07:31.680 --> 07:34.180
<b>Just try and find your way to the surface!</b>

07:44.390 --> 07:47.280
<b>Now, will he make it up?</b>

07:47.710 --> 07:49.930
<b>Will I smash his skull with my board?</b>

07:49.930 --> 07:52.010
<b>Launch my harpoon through his gut?</b>

07:52.010 --> 07:53.360
<b>Which do I choose?</b>

07:54.040 --> 07:55.500
<b><i>Either way,</i></b>

07:55.500 --> 07:59.780
<b><i>if he shows his face above water, he's done.</i></b>

08:05.260 --> 08:07.330
<b><i>He isn't coming back up...</i></b>

08:08.550 --> 08:11.190
<b><i>Has he drowned?</i></b>

08:11.190 --> 08:12.010
<b><i>No,</i></b>

08:12.770 --> 08:15.690
<b><i>he was confident about his lung capacity.</i></b>

08:16.390 --> 08:19.340
<b><i>That means he can survive for 
ten or twenty minutes.</i></b>

08:20.000 --> 08:21.540
<b><i>No, wait.</i></b>

08:21.540 --> 08:22.880
<b><i>It's just possible</i></b>

08:22.880 --> 08:26.150
<b><i>that he's able to remain underwater like a whale!</i></b>

08:39.480 --> 08:40.650
<b><i>There you are!</i></b>

08:41.250 --> 08:42.950
<b>Don't move!</b>

08:42.950 --> 08:45.170
<b>I'll impale you with my harpoon.</b>

08:47.160 --> 08:49.090
<b><i>Bubbles on the opposite side, too?</i></b>

08:51.330 --> 08:52.490
<b><i>And over here!</i></b>

08:53.990 --> 08:54.920
<b><i>And over there!</i></b>

08:56.280 --> 08:58.830
<b><i>There are air bubbles everywhere...</i></b>

08:59.390 --> 09:00.430
<b><i>I see...</i></b>

09:01.640 --> 09:07.060
<b><i>It's possible, if he formed his smoke 
into a hose with multiple branches.</i></b>

09:07.060 --> 09:09.940
<b><i>That way, he wouldn't give away his position.</i></b>

09:10.180 --> 09:13.460
<b>Hey! How long are you gonna stay under?</b>

09:13.460 --> 09:17.200
<b>Do you expect me to give up and drain the water?</b>

09:18.200 --> 09:19.760
<b><i>No, that isn't it!</i></b>

09:20.870 --> 09:22.890
<b><i>The bubbles are camouflage!</i></b>

09:23.500 --> 09:24.580
<b><i>Is he running?</i></b>

09:25.790 --> 09:29.480
<b><i>If his lung capacity is that great, it's possible</i></b>

09:29.480 --> 09:33.710
<b><i>he could swim out through the maze of 
underground corridors leading down here.</i></b>

09:35.200 --> 09:37.470
<b><i>I can't let him escape!</i></b>

09:38.060 --> 09:43.060
<b><i>I told Welfin and Brovada to stay out of this, 
so I could take all the credit...</i></b>

09:47.070 --> 09:48.410
<b><i>My head's spinning?</i></b>

09:48.890 --> 09:50.880
<b><i>And my chest hurts...</i></b>

09:51.320 --> 09:53.730
<b><i>Have I been poisoned?</i></b>

10:00.600 --> 10:02.280
<b><i>My board disappeared?</i></b>

10:02.280 --> 10:05.270
<b><i>Is it because my physical and 
mental stability are compromised?</i></b>

10:07.730 --> 10:08.920
<b><i>Can't move...</i></b>

10:09.310 --> 10:10.410
<b><i>Can't breathe...</i></b>

10:11.140 --> 10:15.220
<b><i>My power stopped working, 
but the water hasn't gone away?</i></b>

10:15.630 --> 10:17.930
<b><i>Because we're underground?</i></b>

10:18.340 --> 10:20.090
<b><i>Crap...</i></b>

10:21.900 --> 10:26.240
<b><i>I let him think he had the advantage 
so I could turn the tables on him.</i></b>

10:26.240 --> 10:30.270
<b><i>But it looks as though the one 
who was backed into a corner...</i></b>

10:30.940 --> 10:32.800
<b><i>was me...</i></b>

10:42.010 --> 10:43.610
<b><i>Am I gonna die?</i></b>

10:44.410 --> 10:48.750
<b><i>Am I... Am I gonna die here?</i></b>

10:55.640 --> 10:58.510
<b><i>So he was using smoke hoses</i></b>

10:58.510 --> 11:01.180
<b><i>to send air bubbles everywhere.</i></b>

11:01.900 --> 11:04.290
<b><i>But what kind of...</i></b>

11:04.290 --> 11:06.490
<b><i>poison did he use?</i></b>

11:08.460 --> 11:11.020
<b><i>That was faster than I expected.</i></b>

11:11.630 --> 11:13.950
<b><i>The poison you've inhaled is lethal.</i></b>

11:13.950 --> 11:16.530
<b><i>But it's something naturally found in air.</i></b>

11:18.110 --> 11:20.330
<b><i>Carbon dioxide.</i></b>

11:19.220 --> 11:21.270
<b>Carbon Dioxide</b>

11:22.340 --> 11:24.830
<b>Morel used his immense lung capacity</b>

11:25.290 --> 11:28.330
<b>to suck in the stagnant air trapped in the church,</b>

11:28.330 --> 11:32.330
<b>and exhaled it with an increased 
concentration of carbon dioxide.</b>

11:35.460 --> 11:37.710
<b><i>I started my attack</i></b>

11:37.710 --> 11:40.920
<b><i>before you ever began.</i></b>

11:42.220 --> 11:44.530
<b><i>If he was telling the truth,</i></b>

11:44.530 --> 11:47.850
<b><i>Grachan should be getting his ability back.</i></b>

12:12.790 --> 12:15.360
<b><i>I have a few hours in which to move around.</i></b>

12:15.830 --> 12:19.590
<b><i>During that time, I must see 
them with my own eyes!</i></b>

12:23.370 --> 12:26.640
<b><i>I've observed Bizeff's movements 
with my crystal ball.</i></b>

12:27.010 --> 12:29.470
<b><i>I know how to leave this area.</i></b>

12:32.970 --> 12:35.040
<b><i>Even if Bizeff learns I've escaped,</i></b>

12:35.580 --> 12:40.450
<b><i>he can't tell anyone because 
he's kept this area a secret.</i></b>

12:53.800 --> 12:55.250
<b><i>They are...</i></b>

12:56.770 --> 12:58.400
<b><i>up above.</i></b>

13:50.130 --> 13:52.450
<b><i>I can't go any farther.</i></b>

13:54.010 --> 13:55.560
<b><i>But...</i></b>

14:35.870 --> 14:38.600
<b>Oh? How are you feeling?</b>

14:44.730 --> 14:46.680
<b>Octopus! Where am I?</b>

14:46.680 --> 14:48.180
<b>How long was I out?</b>

14:48.180 --> 14:49.610
<b>Don't call me an octopus!</b>

14:53.640 --> 14:56.930
<b>This is an underground clinic for folks 
with roots in the underworld.</b>

14:57.460 --> 15:00.670
<b>You were out for two whole days.</b>

15:01.240 --> 15:03.000
<b>Two days?! I need to get going!</b>

15:03.000 --> 15:03.630
<b>Hey!</b>

15:04.070 --> 15:05.380
<b>You shouldn't move around!</b>

15:05.380 --> 15:06.880
<b>Your wounds will reopen.</b>

15:08.450 --> 15:10.290
<b>I have to follow through with the plan...</b>

15:10.290 --> 15:10.880
<b>Fool!</b>

15:11.370 --> 15:15.230
<b>You were just on the verge of death!</b>

15:15.620 --> 15:16.840
<b>You need a few days before—</b>

15:16.840 --> 15:18.890
<b>Oh, you're awake?</b>

15:19.820 --> 15:21.520
<b>That's great.</b>

15:21.750 --> 15:23.420
<b>Thanks for everything you've done.</b>

15:23.420 --> 15:25.000
<b>I'm checking out now.</b>

15:25.360 --> 15:27.030
<b>Not until you pay me.</b>

15:27.790 --> 15:31.530
<b>Your total bill comes to 1.8 million Jenny.</b>

15:31.530 --> 15:34.780
<b>If you can't pay, I'll take body parts instead.</b>

15:35.670 --> 15:38.910
<b>I don't have my wallet on me. 
I'll wire it to you when I get back.</b>

15:39.500 --> 15:42.830
<b>I'm not stupid enough to trust 
that you'll keep that promise.</b>

15:43.220 --> 15:47.460
<b>Until you find someone to bring 
the money, you're staying here.</b>

15:47.860 --> 15:49.880
<b>I don't have time for that!</b>

15:49.880 --> 15:51.130
<b>Give me a phone!</b>

15:53.770 --> 15:56.230
<b>It costs 10,000 Jenny per minute.</b>

15:56.230 --> 15:58.870
<b>Would you just shut up and go away?</b>

15:58.870 --> 15:59.990
<b>Hello?</b>

15:59.990 --> 16:01.050
<b>Hey, it's me.</b>

16:01.050 --> 16:02.690
<b>Killua!</b>

16:03.120 --> 16:05.090
<b>Where are you? Are you okay?</b>

16:05.090 --> 16:06.310
<b>What happened?</b>

16:06.650 --> 16:08.320
<b>I'll explain when I see you.</b>

16:09.060 --> 16:11.310
<b>A strong enemy gave me some trouble.</b>

16:11.310 --> 16:12.900
<b>I've been in the hospital.</b>

16:13.380 --> 16:14.540
<b>Oh...</b>

16:14.950 --> 16:15.950
<b>Well, I'm glad you called.</b>

16:16.410 --> 16:18.250
<b>This means you're okay now, right?</b>

16:18.250 --> 16:20.580
<b>Yeah, I'll be back soon.</b>

16:20.580 --> 16:21.960
<b>Anything happen on your side?</b>

16:22.240 --> 16:25.430
<b>We've found a strong ally.</b>

16:25.800 --> 16:27.960
<b>He's bonding with Knuckle.</b>

16:28.520 --> 16:31.960
<b>We have a plan that could 
defeat the King if it goes well.</b>

16:32.400 --> 16:33.460
<b>Oh...</b>

16:33.460 --> 16:35.970
<b>We should meet, so I can hear what you think.</b>

16:36.550 --> 16:37.450
<b>Okay.</b>

16:37.860 --> 16:41.420
<b>Then, I need you to send money 
to a certain bank account.</b>

16:41.730 --> 16:44.380
<b>If you do that, we can rendezvous today.</b>

16:47.360 --> 16:49.360
<b>That just leaves Palm.</b>

16:49.360 --> 16:51.700
<b>You haven't been able to reach her?</b>

16:51.700 --> 16:52.330
<b>No.</b>

16:52.820 --> 16:55.110
<b>She's probably still in the palace...</b>

16:55.680 --> 17:00.120
<b>But wouldn't that mean Neferpitou's 
<i>Nen</i> has already exposed her?</b>

17:00.390 --> 17:03.380
<b>I imagine she's in the warehouse, 
beneath the palace.</b>

17:03.840 --> 17:07.550
<b>There are about five kilometers 
of corridors surrounding it.</b>

17:07.890 --> 17:09.530
<b>Pitou's <i>En</i> can't reach that far.</b>

17:09.980 --> 17:15.820
<b>But since the exit is in the 
palace, she can't get out.</b>

17:18.270 --> 17:20.080
<b>How's Knov-san doing?</b>

17:20.580 --> 17:21.640
<b>Well...</b>

17:22.400 --> 17:24.340
<b>he's probably out of this fight.</b>

17:29.510 --> 17:32.650
<b>But he did manage to place the exits.</b>

17:33.120 --> 17:35.500
<b>There's no change to our plan.</b>

17:38.000 --> 17:39.520
<b>Three days to go...</b>

17:46.920 --> 17:51.400
<b><i>His wounds are already healed!</i></b>

18:00.340 --> 18:01.430
<b>No problem.</b>

18:03.600 --> 18:06.970
<b>Okay, I confirmed receipt of the money.</b>

18:06.970 --> 18:09.960
<b>You can leave. Right now.</b>

18:20.110 --> 18:21.700
<b>What are you doing?</b>

18:22.350 --> 18:23.260
<b>Let's go.</b>

18:23.260 --> 18:24.010
<b>Huh?</b>

18:24.340 --> 18:25.700
<b>We're gonna join my buddies.</b>

18:26.300 --> 18:27.560
<b>I'll introduce you.</b>

18:31.820 --> 18:32.910
<b>But...</b>

18:36.110 --> 18:38.640
<b>Well, I won't force you.</b>

18:39.780 --> 18:41.600
<b>I'll just tell you this.</b>

18:41.600 --> 18:42.580
<b>Thank you.</b>

18:43.560 --> 18:45.240
<b>Uh, wait...</b>

18:45.570 --> 18:46.740
<b>Actually...</b>

18:50.080 --> 18:51.230
<b>It's okay if I come?</b>

18:52.570 --> 18:54.630
<b>I mean, I'm just a...</b>

18:56.390 --> 18:57.380
<b>What?</b>

18:57.980 --> 19:01.240
<b>Was I the only one who thought 
we were already friends?</b>

19:06.210 --> 19:07.220
<b>It's really...</b>

19:08.080 --> 19:09.250
<b>okay?</b>

19:09.890 --> 19:11.760
<b>It isn't about what's okay.</b>

19:11.760 --> 19:13.410
<b>It's whether you're coming or not.</b>

19:14.310 --> 19:16.760
<b>I'm going! I'm going with you!</b>

19:23.670 --> 19:25.390
<b>I want to make something clear.</b>

19:26.180 --> 19:28.480
<b>The next time something like this happens,</b>

19:28.480 --> 19:30.520
<b>I won't bother thanking you.</b>

19:31.640 --> 19:36.170
<b>So if something happens, 
and I end up helping you,</b>

19:36.640 --> 19:38.760
<b>you don't need to thank me.</b>

19:40.430 --> 19:42.530
<b>Friends are supposed to help friends.</b>

19:45.090 --> 19:47.140
<b>From now on, we'll be working together.</b>

19:47.140 --> 19:49.110
<b>So we'll be helping each other.</b>

19:49.520 --> 19:52.790
<b>Supporting each other isn't a big deal.</b>

19:53.760 --> 19:57.240
<b>It'd be lame to thank each other 
for every little thing.</b>

19:59.990 --> 20:02.770
<b><i>Yeah, this is it.</i></b>

20:03.580 --> 20:05.900
<b><i>This is the world I wanted.</i></b>

20:06.570 --> 20:09.230
<b><i>The world I longed for and sought...</i></b>

20:09.550 --> 20:13.160
<b><i>But deep down, I thought 
it was beyond my reach...</i></b>

20:13.600 --> 20:16.500
<b><i>That it wasn't meant for me... 
And wouldn't happen...</i></b>

20:17.020 --> 20:18.940
<b><i>I'd given up on this world.</i></b>

20:19.580 --> 20:22.520
<b><i>I thought it wasn't meant to be...</i></b>

20:26.100 --> 20:28.240
<b>Killua, I'm...</b>

20:28.770 --> 20:31.280
<b>I'm so happy, I could die!</b>

20:31.280 --> 20:33.790
<b>Huh? Why are you crying?</b>

20:34.200 --> 20:35.690
<b>Because...</b>

20:36.090 --> 20:38.390
<b>Because you're doing this for me!</b>

20:39.470 --> 20:40.910
<b>Come on...</b>

20:41.660 --> 20:43.680
<b>I want to make one more thing clear.</b>

20:44.770 --> 20:47.550
<b>The world you're stepping into is far more brutal</b>

20:48.090 --> 20:50.430
<b>than the world of the Chimera Ants.</b>

20:51.980 --> 20:53.930
<b>They may seem similar,</b>

20:53.930 --> 20:57.860
<b>but there's a huge difference between 
risking a life and throwing it away.</b>

21:02.640 --> 21:05.020
<b>People staring death in the face every day</b>

21:05.020 --> 21:07.410
<b>don't want to hear that someone's ready to die.</b>

21:08.220 --> 21:11.860
<b>Only people who maintain a daily 
regimen to stay in tip-top shape,</b>

21:11.860 --> 21:16.410
<b>and can swallow just enough poison to 
fall short of a lethal dose, get to survive.</b>

21:18.580 --> 21:19.960
<b>That's how it goes.</b>

21:21.330 --> 21:23.310
<b>Are you ready to join us?</b>

21:26.610 --> 21:28.160
<b><i>How could you know</i></b>

21:29.710 --> 21:33.110
<b><i>the words I most wanted to hear?</i></b>

21:36.370 --> 21:37.800
<b>A foolish question.</b>

21:37.800 --> 21:39.480
<b>I see paradise before me.</b>

21:40.620 --> 21:43.490
<b>I'm going, no matter what it costs me.</b>

21:46.650 --> 21:48.420
<b><i>I've seen the other side...</i></b>

21:49.550 --> 21:51.800
<b><i>I've made contact.</i></b>

21:52.120 --> 21:53.670
<b><i>I've learned it really exists...</i></b>

21:56.690 --> 21:59.050
<b><i>And I can reach it!</i></b>

23:24.380 --> 23:26.530
<b>Next time: Gungi x Of x Komugi.</b>

23:26.530 --> 23:28.150
<b>2-1-3, marshal.</b>

23:28.150 --> 23:29.610
<b>4-5-1, knight.</b>

23:29.610 --> 23:31.390
<b>8-7-uh...</b>

23:31.390 --> 23:32.100
<b>lieutenant general!</b>

23:32.100 --> 23:34.230
<b>4-3-3... 2?</b>

23:34.230 --> 23:36.020
<b>My phone number!</b>
