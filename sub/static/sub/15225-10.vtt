01:38.968 --> 01:41.434
May I have your attention,
please?

01:41.467 --> 01:43.267
God knows, I hate to interrupt

01:43.300 --> 01:47.300
the important conversations
I know you're all having,

01:47.334 --> 01:51.567
but someone special
is retiring today

01:51.601 --> 01:55.467
after 41 years
with Sunshine Cabs.

01:55.501 --> 01:58.734
These are the last receipts

01:58.767 --> 02:05.033
that will ever be turned in
by our old friend Maxie...

02:07.334 --> 02:09.334
What is that, "Mulch"?

02:09.366 --> 02:11.334
Mulcher?

02:11.367 --> 02:12.601
Melcher.

02:12.634 --> 02:13.601
Terrible handwriting.

02:13.634 --> 02:16.367
Nerves go first, huh, Maxie?

02:16.400 --> 02:22.968
Anyway, it's customary,
when a person retires

02:23.000 --> 02:25.667
to present them
with a little gift

02:25.701 --> 02:28.667
to help them keep track
of the time.

02:28.701 --> 02:30.667
So here you are, Maxie,

02:30.701 --> 02:37.133
a lovely calendar depicting
12 different scenes

02:37.167 --> 02:39.901
of American highways.

02:39.934 --> 02:41.701
Use it in good health.

02:50.567 --> 02:51.968
Thank you.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.434
You know, a lot of you...

02:54.467 --> 02:58.868
Rodriguez, 993.

02:58.901 --> 03:00.467
Murphy...

03:00.501 --> 03:01.567
Louie...

03:01.601 --> 03:03.601
Beat it, Max.

03:05.634 --> 03:07.601
Look, uh, Jeff,

03:07.634 --> 03:11.634
if anybody wants me,
I'll be in the library.

03:22.701 --> 03:24.801
Just act natural

03:24.834 --> 03:26.267
and don't make a fuss
over this.

03:26.300 --> 03:28.534
Over a briefcase?

03:28.567 --> 03:30.767
This isn't <i>any</i>
briefcase, Elaine.

03:30.801 --> 03:32.267
I was cruising
the Broadway District,

03:32.300 --> 03:33.801
like I do on Thursdays,

03:33.834 --> 03:35.000
you know, hoping
to make a contact.

03:35.033 --> 03:36.133
The guy I picked up

03:36.167 --> 03:38.501
left this in the back
of the cab, right?

03:38.534 --> 03:40.701
And I was thinking that maybe
there's a chance this guy

03:40.734 --> 03:42.601
might be important
in the theater, you know?

03:42.634 --> 03:44.400
Oh, and he's going to
owe you a favor

03:44.434 --> 03:45.701
for returning this, right?

03:45.734 --> 03:47.434
Hey, Elaine, you know,

03:47.467 --> 03:49.033
there are a lot of ways
to make it in the theater,

03:49.067 --> 03:50.400
and if being nice
is one of them,

03:50.434 --> 03:51.701
I'm willing to give it a shot.

03:51.734 --> 03:52.968
Beautiful thought, Bob.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.100
Beautifully put.
Thanks.

03:54.133 --> 03:55.334
Hey, what's up?

03:55.367 --> 03:57.234
Shh. I don't want Louie
to know about this.

03:57.267 --> 03:58.934
I found it in
the back of my cab.

03:58.968 --> 04:01.868
You have that, too, huh?

04:01.901 --> 04:06.234
I'm always finding stuff
people leave behind--

04:06.267 --> 04:11.901
old magazines, gloves, meat...

04:11.934 --> 04:13.467
Meat?

04:13.501 --> 04:16.300
Not good meat-- chewy.

04:16.334 --> 04:17.666
Oh.

04:17.701 --> 04:21.466
Jim, sit down.

04:21.500 --> 04:23.634
Anyway, if I'm going
to return this

04:23.667 --> 04:24.834
I got to get it unlocked

04:24.868 --> 04:26.367
to find out
who it belongs to,

04:26.400 --> 04:28.567
but I've been trying,
and I can't do it.

04:28.601 --> 04:29.701
I thought the rule was,

04:29.734 --> 04:31.534
anything you find in a cab,
you got to turn in to Louie.

04:31.567 --> 04:33.634
Anything that goes
into Louie's cage

04:33.667 --> 04:35.234
vanishes from
the face of the earth.

04:35.267 --> 04:38.567
Yes, with the definite exception
of Louie himself.

04:38.601 --> 04:41.167
Hey, you know what? There are
initials on this-- N.Z.

04:41.200 --> 04:42.968
Norman Zelnick!

04:43.000 --> 04:45.334
My God.

04:45.367 --> 04:46.834
Who's Norman Zelnick?

04:46.868 --> 04:49.267
I was hoping
one of you would know.

04:49.300 --> 04:51.601
Geeze.

04:56.400 --> 04:59.701
All right, so I guess we're just
gonna have to bust it open, huh?

04:59.734 --> 05:02.067
No, no, no, Tony.
I don't want to
ruin the case.

05:02.100 --> 05:03.968
Ooh... Latka's a mechanic.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.167
He's got to have something
that can open this.

05:05.200 --> 05:06.534
Yeah, that's right.

05:06.567 --> 05:07.534
Latka, come here.

05:07.567 --> 05:08.534
What?

05:08.567 --> 05:09.734
Take a look at this case.

05:09.767 --> 05:11.334
You think you can open it?

05:11.367 --> 05:12.501
Oh, sure, I can.

05:12.534 --> 05:14.400
I have just the right tool.

05:15.534 --> 05:17.901
Give him a chance,
give him a chance.

05:17.934 --> 05:19.400
( <i>yelling</i> )

05:19.434 --> 05:21.567
Latka!

05:21.601 --> 05:23.567
What the hell is this, Iwo Jima?

05:25.100 --> 05:26.400
What's going on here?

05:26.434 --> 05:29.267
Louie, Louie, I found
this briefcase

05:29.300 --> 05:30.367
in the back of my cab

05:30.400 --> 05:32.534
and you're not getting it.

05:32.567 --> 05:35.267
Well, why don't you open it
and find out whose it is?

05:35.300 --> 05:37.667
Oh, you think
it's that easy, huh?

05:37.701 --> 05:41.133
Well, I've been trying,
I been trying and I
can't do it.

05:41.167 --> 05:42.234
I'll open it for you.

05:42.267 --> 05:45.968
Yeah, what makes you
think you can open it?

06:23.367 --> 06:26.033
Ten bucks, Wheeler.

06:27.367 --> 06:29.400
All right, ten bucks.

06:29.434 --> 06:31.501
Easy to come by.

06:31.534 --> 06:32.534
Do your worst.

06:32.567 --> 06:34.200
Pleasure doing business
with you.

06:34.234 --> 06:35.834
All right.
Come on, come on.

06:46.067 --> 06:48.567
Okay, okay...

06:48.601 --> 06:49.868
you ain't getting anything
that's in there, Louie.

06:49.901 --> 06:50.901
What? What?

06:50.934 --> 06:52.133
What? What?
Come on, now,

06:52.167 --> 06:53.300
you got your money.
Now, get out of here.

06:53.334 --> 06:55.000
Go! Shoo! Shoo!
Scram, mush, mush!

07:04.434 --> 07:05.567

07:05.601 --> 07:07.234
I got... I got to have
something out of

07:07.267 --> 07:08.567
that briefcase.

to, please!

Louie, you get
out of here, Louie...

07:10.834 --> 07:12.334
No, I mean it, Wheeler,
I mean it.

07:12.367 --> 07:13.334
Get out of here.

Uh, Bob,
I think he's serious.

07:15.367 --> 07:17.601
He needs this.
He's not like us.

Just anything, Wheeler,
anything.

07:52.067 --> 07:54.300
A <i>human being</i> couldn't.

Looks like the guy
who owns this

07:58.267 --> 07:59.234
is a pretty rich dude.

I may have
hit the jackpot.

08:02.234 --> 08:03.868
I don't know
who this guy is.
Let's see.

08:03.901 --> 08:05.734
But he's got a picture
of Stephen Sondheim.

08:05.767 --> 08:06.934
Oh, let me see.

08:06.968 --> 08:08.067
That's Stephen Sondheim?

08:08.100 --> 08:09.200
Yeah, the guy
on the left.

08:09.234 --> 08:10.567
I don't recognize
the other guy.

08:10.601 --> 08:12.067
Maybe that's Norman Zelnick.

08:12.100 --> 08:13.667
Hmm.

08:16.701 --> 08:20.334
There isn't any
Norman Zelnick.

08:20.367 --> 08:22.701
Wait, Bobby.

08:22.734 --> 08:25.534
I've heard that name before.

08:27.234 --> 08:28.701
Oh, my gosh!
Look at this!

08:28.734 --> 08:30.701
It's a picture
of Paul Newman!

08:30.734 --> 08:33.534
Hey, yeah, and the guy
up here is the same guy

08:33.567 --> 08:35.366
as the picture down here.

08:35.400 --> 08:36.868
Whose briefcase
this must be.

08:36.900 --> 08:38.234
This is fun.

08:38.267 --> 08:40.734
Hey, hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

08:40.767 --> 08:42.100
What are we doing here?

08:42.133 --> 08:43.868
Are we trying to find out
the name of the guy

08:43.900 --> 08:45.567
who owns this,
so we can give
it back to him

08:45.601 --> 08:47.367
or are we just
snooping through
his briefcase?

08:47.400 --> 08:49.267
We're just snooping
through his briefcase.

08:49.300 --> 08:50.467
And loving every minute of it.

08:50.501 --> 08:53.667
Whoa, look what I got here--
his appointment book.

Oh, wow, look at that.

08:57.434 --> 08:59.701
"Tuesday, lunch,
L. Strasberg."

08:59.734 --> 09:01.467
That's Lee Strasberg.

"Wednesday,

09:03.334 --> 09:05.033
Minnelli.
Doesn't say.

09:05.067 --> 09:06.400
Got to be.

09:06.434 --> 09:08.868
Wow, he's having lunch
with somebody famous

( <i>chuckling</i> ):
Oh, look at this.

09:13.400 --> 09:15.901
He knows Cary Grant--
an autographed picture.

09:15.934 --> 09:17.567
Oh, wow.

09:19.434 --> 09:20.734
Who do you figure
this guy is?

09:20.767 --> 09:21.734
I don't know.

09:21.767 --> 09:23.567
Maybe he's an agent,
maybe a producer.

09:23.601 --> 09:25.734
Or maybe a real estate
salesman.

09:25.767 --> 09:27.801

Uh-huh.

09:27.834 --> 09:29.400

He sells real estate.
Well...

09:30.968 --> 09:33.033
What's he doing with all these
pictures of celebrities?

09:33.067 --> 09:36.234
I don't know. He must, uh,
specialize in famous people.

09:36.267 --> 09:37.767
Sorry, Bobby.
( <i>scoffs</i> )

09:37.801 --> 09:39.968
Well, what's he doing the
rest of the week, Elaine?

09:40.000 --> 09:41.934
I don't know.
I'm starting to
feel real funny

09:41.968 --> 09:43.400
about looking
through this.
Ah...

09:43.434 --> 09:45.267
I mean, it is private
property, you know?

09:45.300 --> 09:47.100
Aah...
So one more.

09:47.133 --> 09:49.300
Okay. All right.

09:49.334 --> 09:50.767
"Woody's costume party,
Saturday night."

That's it.

09:51.801 --> 09:52.868
That's it.

09:52.901 --> 09:55.067
That's one of Woody Allen's
famous parties.

09:55.100 --> 09:58.400
He throws them once a year.
It's a tradition...

09:58.434 --> 10:00.901
All the biggest celebrities
in the world show up there.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.000
Yeah, biggies,
like Neal Zacherman, hmm?

10:03.033 --> 10:04.534
No, no, Alex.
Nah...

10:04.567 --> 10:06.267
Really big stars, too.

10:06.300 --> 10:07.767
I didn't read
about it in
the paper.

10:07.801 --> 10:09.968
Well, it's not in the papers.
It's a secret.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.701
He wants to keep out
the crashers.

10:11.734 --> 10:13.901
Oh! You know,
except for
the people

10:13.934 --> 10:15.701
who are invited to
this party, I mean,

10:15.734 --> 10:18.133
we may be the
only ones who
know about it.

10:18.167 --> 10:19.701
That's very likely.

10:19.734 --> 10:21.200
Yeah.

Scarlett O'Hara.

10:28.501 --> 10:29.501
I'll be Cyrano.

who anyone is.

It'll be great.
Yes!
Yes!

If you get caught,
you're gonna look foolish.

10:41.200 --> 10:42.634
It's worth the risk.

help my career.

to be contact city.

to you, go ahead.

What do you
need me for?

10:53.434 --> 10:55.234
Well, if you go, that
means it's not so nuts.

10:57.200 --> 10:59.601
So, the only way you're not
gonna look as crazy as you are

10:59.634 --> 11:01.000
is if I look
as crazy as you are?

where the party is,

12:32.734 --> 12:35.467
that means Louie

from ourselves?

in the same room with them.

Latka, that's the worst
possible thing you could do.

ask other celebrities
for their autographs.

Bobby, that's okay.
Take it easy.

20:06.868 --> 20:09.667

what this means?

20:09.701 --> 20:11.501
Hal Prince is
going to find out

on him snuck in here to do it.

from famous people.

20:22.968 --> 20:24.901
Yeah, well,
who'd you get, Latka?

20:24.934 --> 20:26.367
Well... Look.

20:26.400 --> 20:29.901
First... first here
is George Hanson.

20:29.934 --> 20:33.901
It says, "Best wishes
to my buddy, Latka."

20:33.934 --> 20:36.267
And next here is, uh...

20:36.300 --> 20:37.534
"Nice costume, Latka."

20:37.567 --> 20:39.934
Signed... is
signed by Fran

20:39.968 --> 20:41.767
Petricini.

20:41.801 --> 20:45.534
"Here's looking
at you, Latka.

20:45.567 --> 20:47.334
Gus Bates."

20:47.367 --> 20:49.267
Who <i>are</i> these people?

20:49.300 --> 20:52.133
Well, there
is Gus Bates
over there

20:52.167 --> 20:54.167
in the Lone
Ranger outfit.

20:54.200 --> 20:56.067
You know, suddenly,
I'm not so sure

20:56.100 --> 20:57.634
we are where
we think we are.

20:57.667 --> 20:59.868
Boy, I know
that feeling.

21:01.567 --> 21:04.133
This explains something
I heard earlier.

21:04.167 --> 21:06.667
I heard somebody said
that they were in the Pacific

21:06.701 --> 21:08.501
with this guy Woody
during World War II.

21:08.534 --> 21:11.634
I figured they meant
he was entertaining the troops.

21:11.667 --> 21:13.200
Woody Allen
would have been

21:13.234 --> 21:15.234
about four years old
in World War II.

21:15.267 --> 21:17.734
I didn't know when he got
started in show business.

21:19.200 --> 21:20.701
So, who are
these people, then?

21:20.734 --> 21:22.400
Friends of Neal
Zacherman's.

21:22.434 --> 21:24.834
Yeah, probably a bunch
of real estate people.
Mm-hmm.

21:24.868 --> 21:27.701
That means I didn't throw up
on Hal Prince. ( <i>chuckles</i> )

21:27.734 --> 21:30.234
You're still young.

21:30.267 --> 21:31.701
Come on, let's get
out of this place.

21:31.734 --> 21:32.901
Come on, let's
go have a beer.

21:32.934 --> 21:34.067
Yeah.
Come on.
Yeah.

21:34.100 --> 21:35.801
Yeah, let's go.
Come on.
That's a good idea.

21:35.834 --> 21:38.200
Where's the
nearest U.S.O.?

21:38.234 --> 21:39.634
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

21:39.667 --> 21:40.634
What?
Wait a minute.

21:40.667 --> 21:41.734
We're crazy, huh?

21:41.767 --> 21:43.534
What's the big deal?

21:43.567 --> 21:44.834
A moment ago,
we were having

21:44.868 --> 21:46.267
the greatest party
of our life

21:46.300 --> 21:48.634
because we, uh, thought
we were among celebrities.

21:48.667 --> 21:50.367
So what if they're
not celebrities?!

21:50.400 --> 21:52.367
They still could be interesting
people, can't they?

21:52.400 --> 21:55.634
I'm going to
get to know,
uh, Gus Bates.

21:57.400 --> 22:00.000
Hi. I'm Alex Rieger.

22:00.033 --> 22:01.267
I'm Gus Bates.

22:02.701 --> 22:04.534
Wait up, you guys!

22:04.567 --> 22:06.801
( <i>Dixieland jazz playing</i> )

22:29.601 --> 22:31.667
( <i>sighs</i> )

22:31.701 --> 22:33.901
Oh, we're
almost home.

22:33.934 --> 22:36.334
What a depressing night.

22:36.367 --> 22:37.334
You're telling me.

22:37.367 --> 22:39.300
ALEX:
Aw, come on, Elaine. Hey!

22:39.334 --> 22:41.701
You know, I mean,
you might have lost Rhett,

22:41.734 --> 22:44.968
you might have lost Al Pacino,
but you still got Patty...

22:45.000 --> 22:46.033
Maxine...

22:46.067 --> 22:47.067
And Laverne.

22:47.100 --> 22:48.234
ALEX:
Hit it, girls.

22:49.434 --> 22:52.200
* <i>Bei mir bist du schon</i> *

22:52.234 --> 22:54.434
* Please let me explain 

22:54.467 --> 22:58.434
* <i>"Bei mir bist du schon"</i>
means that you're grand *

23:00.033 --> 23:03.200
* <i>Bei mir bist du schon</i> *

23:03.234 --> 23:05.234
* Again I'll explain 

23:05.267 --> 23:09.400
* It means you're
the fairest in the land *

23:09.434 --> 23:12.167
* I could say <i>"bella, bella"</i> *

23:12.200 --> 23:14.534
* Even say <i>"wunderbar"</i> *

23:14.567 --> 23:18.234
* Each language
only helps me tell you *

23:18.267 --> 23:20.000
* How grand you are 

23:20.033 --> 23:22.667
* I tried to explain 

23:22.701 --> 23:25.033
* <i>Bei mir bist du schon</i> *

23:25.067 --> 23:30.234
* So kiss me and say
you'll understand. *

23:41.067 --> 23:44.467
( <i>theme music playing</i> )

24:08.033 --> 24:09.567
WOMAN:
Night, Mr. Walters.
