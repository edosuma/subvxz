07:40.000 --> 07:42.900
AND ONE WORD OF ADVICE
BEFORE I LET YOU GO ââ

07:43.000 --> 07:46.460
WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT USE
THE PARTY PALACE BOOTH

07:46.560 --> 07:48.500
I HAD SET UP
FOR THIS PARTY.

07:48.600 --> 07:49.780
WHY NOT?

07:49.880 --> 07:52.500
IT'S MUCH TOO MUCH PARTY
FOR YOU, PARTY HORSE.

07:52.600 --> 07:56.060
IT'S THE BEST PARTY
IN THE UNIVERSE ââ IN A BOX.

07:56.160 --> 07:58.260
JUST THOUGHT
I'D WARN YOU.

07:58.360 --> 07:59.740
WELL, GOODBYE.

07:59.840 --> 08:02.060
DUDES,
I'M SO CONFUSED.

08:02.160 --> 08:03.620
GO FOR IT, MAN.

08:03.720 --> 08:05.720
MAYBE THIS IS THE LAST BIT
OF PARTYING YOU NEED

08:05.320 --> 08:07.320
TO GET THE PARTYING
OUT OF YOUR SYSTEM FOR GOOD.

08:07.080 --> 08:09.080
I'LL DO IT.

08:09.520 --> 08:10.820
AWWW, YEAH!

08:10.920 --> 08:13.580
GET READY FOR THE NEW ME,
CHRISSY!

08:13.680 --> 08:15.680
( ALARM BLARING )
Female voice:
<i>PARTY HORSE DETECTED.</i>

08:15.200 --> 08:17.200
HUH? WHAT IS THAT?
<i>INITIATING LOCKDOWN.</i>

08:17.760 --> 08:19.460
( LAUGHS MANIACALLY )

08:19.560 --> 08:22.300
THE REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY
WORKED PERFECTLY!

08:22.400 --> 08:25.100
I'VE FINALLY TRAPPED
PARTY HORSE!

08:25.200 --> 08:26.740
SO, WAIT. HOLD ON.
I'M SORRY.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.840
IS THERE, LIKE, <i>NOT</i>
A REALLY COOL PARTY IN THIS BOX?

08:28.920 --> 08:30.420
YOU FOOL.

08:30.520 --> 08:32.380
THIS ISN'T A PARTY
IN A BOX.

08:32.480 --> 08:35.940
IT'S A BOX THAT SUCKS THE PARTY
OUT OF YOUR BONES ââ

08:36.040 --> 08:37.500
PERMANENTLY!
( GASPS )

08:37.600 --> 08:41.320
PREPARE YOURSELF,
PARTY HORSE 42699.

08:41.800 --> 08:45.640
YOUR PARTY
IS ABOUT TO GET POOPED!

08:46.520 --> 08:47.260
( BOTH GASP )

08:47.360 --> 08:49.020
STOP!!

08:49.120 --> 08:51.540
DAD! STOP IT!

08:51.640 --> 08:52.820
NO, CHRISSY.

08:52.920 --> 08:54.920
IF THIS IS WHAT'LL STOP ME
FROM PARTYING,

08:54.240 --> 08:55.500
THEN I'LL DO IT.

08:55.600 --> 08:56.620
FOR YOU.
BUT ââ

08:56.720 --> 08:57.820
HE SAID
HE'LL DO IT!

08:57.920 --> 08:59.380
( WHIRRING )

08:59.480 --> 09:00.780
( GASPS )

09:00.880 --> 09:02.620
OH! OH!

09:02.720 --> 09:03.580
OH, I CAN'T WATCH!

09:03.680 --> 09:06.160
PARTY HORSE 42699?

09:07.560 --> 09:09.560
( WHIRRING STOPS )

09:18.200 --> 09:21.700
I...LIKE EATING SANDWICHES...

09:21.800 --> 09:24.140
AND...FANTASY FOOTBALL.

09:24.240 --> 09:26.240
EUGH!
EUGH!

09:24.800 --> 09:26.800
UH...WHAT?

09:27.240 --> 09:28.980
AT LAST!
I'VE DONE IT!

09:29.080 --> 09:31.340
I'VE BROKEN
PARTY HORSE!

09:31.440 --> 09:33.980
WELL DONE,
PRINCIPAL PARTY HORSE, SIR.

09:34.080 --> 09:35.660
IS THIS WHAT YOU WANTED,
CHRISSY?

09:35.760 --> 09:36.860
NO!

09:36.960 --> 09:38.700
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO TELL YOU
ALL ALONG,

09:38.800 --> 09:41.160
BUT YOU NEVER EVEN CHILLED OUT
LONG ENOUGH TO LISTEN TO ME!

09:41.240 --> 09:43.460
I JUST WANTED YOU
TO TAKE IT DOWN A NOTCH.

09:43.560 --> 09:44.500
THAT'S ALL?

09:44.600 --> 09:45.820
WELL, I CAN DO THAT.

09:45.920 --> 09:47.740
CHANGE HIM BACK,

09:47.840 --> 09:49.580
DRINK UP, BABE.

09:49.680 --> 09:51.680

09:55.200 --> 09:56.220
HERE YOU GO, BABE.

09:56.320 --> 09:58.480

FOR YOU.

09:59.840 --> 10:01.840
OH, BABE!

10:03.560 --> 10:05.900
PARTY HORSE

10:06.000 --> 10:07.940

10:08.040 --> 10:09.900

10:10.000 --> 10:11.500
( GROANS )

10:11.600 --> 10:13.580
( German accent )
IT IS ABOUT ZE LONG GAME, HM?

10:13.680 --> 10:15.420
THANKS FOR ALL YOUR HELP
WITH THIS, GUYS.

10:15.520 --> 10:16.980
YOU HAVE

10:17.080 --> 10:19.060

10:22.360 --> 10:24.260
( GRUNTS, SIGHS )

10:24.360 --> 10:25.260
THERE'S NOTHING ââ

10:25.360 --> 10:26.260
( GASPS )

10:26.360 --> 10:28.360
( GROANS )
