WEBVTT

00:19.229 --> 00:21.106
- Patrick.
- Hey, Patrick.

00:21.272 --> 00:22.649
We are kinda drunk.

00:22.816 --> 00:24.275
- Oh, boy.
- So drunk.

00:24.442 --> 00:26.277
Like inappropriate-
for-a-work-party drunk.

00:26.444 --> 00:28.571
Like stop-me-if-I-start-
doing-cartwheels.

00:28.738 --> 00:30.615
It's kinda my thing
when I'm wasted.

00:30.782 --> 00:32.826
I think I remember that
from the Christmas party.

00:32.992 --> 00:34.703
How long do you guys
think this is gonna go?

00:36.579 --> 00:38.665
- David Beckham is beckoning us.
- I can't believe that he gets

00:38.832 --> 00:41.042
to take credit for a game that he
barely worked on.

00:42.919 --> 00:44.337
Uh, hello, hello, hello.

00:44.504 --> 00:45.964
As you know, I'm not normally
one for speeches,

00:46.131 --> 00:47.882
but, uh,
it has to be said,

00:48.049 --> 00:50.760
15 million units
in less than a month

00:50.927 --> 00:53.513
is bloody brilliant!

00:53.680 --> 00:56.141
And it must be celebrated.
It must.

00:56.307 --> 00:58.643
So, to you.

00:59.894 --> 01:01.521
To Most Dangerous Games.

01:09.487 --> 01:11.489
Hey, hey, hey.

01:11.656 --> 01:13.491
Where are you going?
The party's just getting started.

01:13.658 --> 01:14.993
Mind if cut out early?
You don't need me

01:15.160 --> 01:16.953
for anything anymore, do you?

01:17.120 --> 01:18.997
Uh, well, that's
a pretty loaded question.

01:19.164 --> 01:21.750
For work purposes.
You don't need me to stay, right?

01:21.916 --> 01:24.169
No, of course not.
Today's completely extracurricular--

01:24.335 --> 01:26.129
Awesome.
Thank you.

01:28.047 --> 01:29.591
Patrick.

01:32.886 --> 01:34.804
Jesus.

01:34.971 --> 01:36.765
This is unbearable.

01:39.267 --> 01:40.894
How are you not a wreck?

01:41.060 --> 01:42.562
I haven't been
able to sleep all week.

01:42.729 --> 01:44.606
Maybe you should
take something for that.

01:46.232 --> 01:48.485
Oh, I see.
Right.

01:49.444 --> 01:51.112
So that's how this
is going to be, is it?

01:51.279 --> 01:53.156
- What do you want me to say?
- I don't know. I didn't think it'd

01:53.323 --> 01:55.074
- be this easy for you.
- It's not that it's easy for me.

01:55.241 --> 01:58.036
You chose Jon.
That's it. End of story.

01:58.203 --> 01:59.788
We're both grownups, okay?
We don't have to make

01:59.954 --> 02:01.414
a big deal about it.

02:01.581 --> 02:04.042
I think it's actually kind of
a relief. No more sneaking around.

02:04.209 --> 02:05.919
No more pretending
that we're not together.

02:06.085 --> 02:07.712
No more lies
or secrets or stress.

02:07.879 --> 02:10.048
- It's good.
- Mm-hmm.

02:10.215 --> 02:12.383
And no one got hurt.

02:12.550 --> 02:14.177
It'll be fine, Kevin.

02:58.805 --> 03:00.390
"Anyone with
a driver's license

03:00.557 --> 03:02.517
wanna help me
pick up a truck?"

03:14.070 --> 03:16.030
- Is it safe?
- What do you mean?

03:16.197 --> 03:18.241
You do know I can always tell
when you're spanking

03:18.408 --> 03:20.535
- the monkey, right?
- Oh, God. I was using headphones.

03:20.702 --> 03:22.328
And your silence
speaks volumes.

03:22.495 --> 03:25.039
- Okay.
- Where you going?

03:25.206 --> 03:26.666
Uh, Richie needs help
with something.

03:26.833 --> 03:29.043
- Excuse me?
- He needs someone

03:29.210 --> 03:30.795
with a license
to drive a truck for him.

03:30.962 --> 03:33.256
And you just happened
to volunteer?

03:33.423 --> 03:35.633
Yes, I just happened
to volunteer.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.468
I'm sorry.
Do you have an opinion about that?

03:37.635 --> 03:39.512
I'm sorry.
No, it's super cool.

03:39.679 --> 03:42.015
I think it's so smart that you and
Richie are trying to get back

03:42.181 --> 03:45.018
together mere weeks after Kevin.
That's not what I'm doing.

03:45.852 --> 03:48.855
- Okay. You sure about that?
- Yes, I'm sure.

03:49.022 --> 03:51.065
Just, honestly,
Paddy, please,

03:51.232 --> 03:52.775
don't let this
be a rebound thing.

03:52.942 --> 03:55.111
Especially not with Richie
now that he's with Brady.

03:55.278 --> 03:56.571
Listen, this is not
a rebound thing.

03:56.738 --> 03:58.948
I just miss being friends with him
and hanging out. That's all.

04:00.325 --> 04:02.160
Just please
be careful, okay?

04:02.327 --> 04:04.621
If you're not going to work today,
will you please clean the bathroom?

04:04.787 --> 04:07.290
Your fur balls are making me dry
heave every time I take a shower.

04:55.964 --> 04:59.467
Hey, how you doing?
Uh, are you at work?

05:08.851 --> 05:10.520
What are you
doing here, Sammi?

05:10.687 --> 05:12.772
You know we got
the common room for that.

05:12.939 --> 05:14.899
It's too loud in there.

05:15.066 --> 05:17.568
What are you doing here?
You don't work today.

05:17.735 --> 05:19.904
I'm still catching up.

05:20.071 --> 05:21.531
Is Eddie around?

05:21.698 --> 05:24.075
You mean your boyfriend?

05:24.242 --> 05:27.120
- Is that why you came in?
- Where is he?

05:27.829 --> 05:29.747
He's home, sick.

05:29.914 --> 05:31.249
What's wrong with him?

05:31.416 --> 05:34.293
I don't know.
He just gets sick sometimes.

05:37.088 --> 05:38.297
You know you can just
do it online now.

05:38.464 --> 05:40.758
Well, that's the thing,
it expires after three months

05:40.925 --> 05:42.719
and I hate going
to the DMV.

05:42.885 --> 05:44.971
Well, yeah.
Seventh level of hell.

05:45.138 --> 05:47.390
Exactly.

05:47.557 --> 05:50.727
So we'll take the BART there
and then we'll drive back.

05:50.893 --> 05:53.271
Yeah, I'm excited. I've never driven
an ice cream truck before.

05:53.438 --> 05:56.190
And you're sure
you can drive stick?

05:56.357 --> 05:57.442
Can I ever.

05:57.608 --> 05:59.777
Sorry. It was a bad joke.

05:59.944 --> 06:01.237
What are you
gonna do with it?

06:01.404 --> 06:03.614
Is it gonna be like
your mobile salon?

06:03.781 --> 06:05.116
Uh, we're selling it,
actually.

06:05.283 --> 06:06.993
You know, that's not
really a bad idea.

06:07.160 --> 06:09.537
You could drive around
the Mission cutting hair.

06:09.704 --> 06:12.540
No, me and my cousin
have this little side thing

06:12.707 --> 06:16.377
where we take junk trucks
and sell them for a profit.

06:16.544 --> 06:18.713
Oh, you flip 'em.
Yeah, exactly.

06:18.880 --> 06:21.299
This one we're selling
to some hipster fuckers

06:21.466 --> 06:23.843
who are gonna sell
shrimp meatballs out of it.

06:24.010 --> 06:26.387
- Doesn't that sound so stupid?
- Yeah, shrimp meatballs?

06:26.554 --> 06:28.765
But, I'm not gonna lie,
actual meatballs

06:28.931 --> 06:30.224
sound kinda good right now.

06:30.391 --> 06:32.143
You want to stop and eat?

06:32.310 --> 06:35.438
Uh...
Uh, no.

06:36.230 --> 06:38.149
- Remember this place?
- Yeah.

06:39.650 --> 06:42.278
Thanks again
for doing this.

06:42.445 --> 06:44.572
Please.
It's what friends do.

06:44.739 --> 06:46.240
Right?

06:48.659 --> 06:50.369
Also, I didn't really feel
like being at work today.

06:50.536 --> 06:53.873
Plus, I have ulterior motives.

06:56.834 --> 06:58.503
I wanna see
where you grew up.

07:00.838 --> 07:03.466
Okay, so now I'm getting
an image of you on a BMX

07:03.633 --> 07:05.551
riding around the block.
Is that right?

07:05.718 --> 07:07.887
- I never had a bike.
- Oh.

07:08.054 --> 07:09.555
I did have a badass
skateboard though.

07:09.722 --> 07:11.432
Oh, no way.
That is so cool,

07:11.599 --> 07:13.851
and so the opposite of me.
I was so not cool.

07:14.018 --> 07:17.271
I spent an entire year riding around
on my sister's old bike.

07:17.438 --> 07:19.857
- Was it pink?
- No, it was not pink.

07:20.024 --> 07:21.776
But it was plastered with
<i>My Little Pony</i> stickers

07:21.943 --> 07:24.904
and glitter-- So much glitter.
It was really bad.

07:26.030 --> 07:27.073
I kind of got
used to it, actually,

07:27.240 --> 07:30.660
but then my dad took it away
and gave me a boys' bike instead.

07:30.827 --> 07:32.328
- Oh, man.
- Yeah, I know.

07:32.495 --> 07:35.623
It was so boring and brown.
I missed all that sparkle.

07:35.790 --> 07:37.291
Yeah, I bet you did.

07:40.378 --> 07:42.713
So how often
do you come back here?

07:42.880 --> 07:45.049
Um, only when
I need to,

07:45.216 --> 07:47.218
and I make it so I don't
need to often.

07:48.761 --> 07:50.888
Are things any better
with your dad?

07:52.306 --> 07:53.641
Pretty much the same.

07:53.808 --> 07:55.685
Bummer.

07:58.521 --> 08:00.022
You know,
I am kind of hungry.

08:01.232 --> 08:03.317
Of course you are, Patrick.

08:03.484 --> 08:05.444
You're always hungry.

08:12.743 --> 08:14.537
Hey, it's AgustÃ­n.

08:16.330 --> 08:18.583
- What are you doing here?
- I heard you were sick.

08:18.749 --> 08:21.502
I brought
some matzo ball soup.

08:21.669 --> 08:23.838
Without texting first?

08:24.005 --> 08:25.506
I wanted to surprise you.

08:25.673 --> 08:27.717
I'm basically
Typhoid Mary right now.

08:27.884 --> 08:29.927
So better just
leave it by the door.

08:30.094 --> 08:31.971
- What?
- Yeah, leave it by the door.

08:32.138 --> 08:34.682
And thank you.
That's super sweet of you.

08:34.849 --> 08:36.767
No, no, no.
Please stop being ridiculous.

08:36.934 --> 08:38.769
Okay?
Open the door.

08:38.936 --> 08:40.771
I'm not leaving.

08:40.938 --> 08:43.691
<i>I'm not leaving
I'm not going</i>

08:43.816 --> 08:45.359
Fuck.

08:46.986 --> 08:48.905
I just wanted
to check up on you.

08:50.198 --> 08:52.783
- You're not sick.
- No.

08:52.950 --> 08:56.037
But I'm preventing illness
by taking a mental health day.

08:56.204 --> 08:58.623
Oh, I see. Well, I just wanted
to check up on you,

08:58.789 --> 09:02.460
and I'm glad to see that
Saint Eddie's not perfect after all.

09:02.627 --> 09:06.172
I've got soup for you.
It's got balls in it.

09:06.339 --> 09:07.924
Love balls.

09:08.549 --> 09:10.468
I'm just asking
because I thought

09:10.635 --> 09:13.304
he would've
driven the truck for you.

09:13.471 --> 09:15.264
- Why?
- Well, because he's the guy

09:15.431 --> 09:17.308
you're dating. So it makes sense
that he would, right?

09:17.475 --> 09:18.893
First of all,
he's on a deadline.

09:19.060 --> 09:21.812
Second of all,
I wouldn't say that we're dating.

09:21.979 --> 09:24.357
Oh, are things not okay
between you and the ginger?

09:25.441 --> 09:27.401
No, things are fine
between me and Brady.

09:27.568 --> 09:30.071
I just don't want to leap and say
that we're dating, that's all.

09:30.238 --> 09:33.783
But, I mean,
you like him, right?

09:33.950 --> 09:37.787
Yeah. Trust me. This time I'm not
going to jump the gun.

09:39.121 --> 09:41.499
Wow. I walked right
into that one, didn't I?

09:41.666 --> 09:43.834
Uh, yeah.
You sorta did.

09:44.001 --> 09:46.128
Come on. What are you gonna eat?
Everything's amazing.

09:46.295 --> 09:47.755
You know, we can talk
about these things--

09:47.922 --> 09:49.507
- about Brady and--
- I know.

09:49.674 --> 09:51.842
I just want you to choose
what you're going to eat.

09:52.009 --> 09:54.345
People get pissed
when you make them wait, you know?

09:54.512 --> 09:58.474
Okay. How giant is
the "giant burrito"?

09:58.641 --> 10:01.310
Uh, it's pretty big.

10:01.477 --> 10:05.273
Okay.

10:05.439 --> 10:07.400
- And for you?
- Giant burrito.

10:08.651 --> 10:11.195
Ooh, this burrito is good.

10:11.362 --> 10:13.823
Told you.

10:13.990 --> 10:15.700
So how's Kevin?

10:19.287 --> 10:21.205
Yeah. Uh, there is
no more Kevin.

10:21.372 --> 10:24.375
I mean, he's not
dead or anything, but we just...

10:24.542 --> 10:26.669
Well, I was going to say "broke up,"
but how can you say break up

10:26.836 --> 10:28.421
when you never were
really together, right?

10:28.587 --> 10:29.880
I ended it.

10:31.173 --> 10:33.718
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

10:33.884 --> 10:35.386
What happened?

10:35.553 --> 10:37.972
Just too much lying.
Way too much.

10:38.139 --> 10:39.765
He was never gonna leave Jon,
and I just started

10:39.932 --> 10:42.893
to feel so shitty, like
really fucking shitty

10:43.060 --> 10:46.439
about Kevin, about myself,
about everyone, so...

10:46.605 --> 10:48.441
...it was just the right
thing to do,

10:48.607 --> 10:50.192
you know?
It just took me a little while

10:50.359 --> 10:53.571
to figure out what everybody else
already knew.

10:53.738 --> 10:56.991
Well, either way, I'm sorry.
Break-ups are always rough.

10:57.158 --> 10:59.035
Yeah, they are.

10:59.201 --> 11:02.163
But to be real with you,
I didn't like you in that situation.

11:02.330 --> 11:04.498
So I'm glad you ended it.

11:12.381 --> 11:15.259
<i>Pato,</i> you--
you got a little...

11:15.426 --> 11:17.094
Oh.

11:18.471 --> 11:19.638
Thank you.

11:22.391 --> 11:25.061
I don't know why you let me
order a burrito the size of a baby.

11:30.441 --> 11:33.527
Well, look at you
in your place of power.

11:33.694 --> 11:36.489
So you managed to get off
after all.

11:36.655 --> 11:38.949
Of course I did.

11:39.116 --> 11:42.286
Three months,
I've been asking to see your office.

11:42.453 --> 11:44.914
- And I keep telling you...
- Now that I'm finally allowed.

11:45.081 --> 11:48.417
...there's nothing to see. It's the same
gamer nerds as in Seattle.

11:48.584 --> 11:52.088
I don't know. I think it's sexy
to see you in your element.

11:56.842 --> 11:59.512
- You okay?
- Yeah, sorry.

11:59.678 --> 12:03.474
It's just all this fucking glass.
People can see in.

12:04.600 --> 12:07.686
Well, I saw the machine.

12:07.853 --> 12:10.147
Are we making t-shirts?

12:10.314 --> 12:13.526
Yes, we are making t-shirts, Jon,
and we are drinking beer

12:13.692 --> 12:16.570
and we're gonna jump the queue
because I'm the boss.

12:16.737 --> 12:20.116
All right.
Well, then the boss and I...

12:20.282 --> 12:22.284
...maybe go
on the inversion table?

12:24.036 --> 12:25.663
Whatever you want, Jon.

12:30.501 --> 12:32.336
So this was
your uncle's place?

12:32.503 --> 12:34.338
Uh, yeah it was,
and my dad's,

12:34.505 --> 12:35.756
but they don't
work here anymore.

12:35.923 --> 12:37.007
Okay.
It's cool.

12:41.011 --> 12:42.680
- Wait, this is the truck?
- This is it.

12:42.847 --> 12:44.223
- Right here?
- Yeah.

12:44.390 --> 12:47.768
Oh, God, this is a clunker.

12:47.935 --> 12:49.770
- Oh!
- Ah, how do you turn this thing off?

12:49.937 --> 12:53.107
- How do you turn this off?
- The button right there.

12:53.357 --> 12:55.067
Oh, that gave me
goosebumps.

12:55.234 --> 12:57.778
Come here, you.

12:59.363 --> 13:02.116
Now who's this
adorable <i>guerito?</i>

13:02.283 --> 13:04.160
Ceci, this is Patrick.
Patrick this is my cousin Ceci.

13:04.368 --> 13:06.370
Is this the <i>pinche puto</i> Patrick

13:06.537 --> 13:07.621
that broke your heart?

13:07.788 --> 13:09.957
That Patrick?

13:10.124 --> 13:14.879
Oh, wow.

13:15.045 --> 13:16.922
He's doing me a favor.

13:17.089 --> 13:19.758
Sorry. I forgot to warn you about my
cousin's weird sense of humor.

13:19.925 --> 13:22.428
That's okay. I don't mind.
It's so nice to meet you, Cici.

13:22.595 --> 13:23.846
- Ceci.
- "Sigh-see."

13:24.013 --> 13:26.056
- Ceci. Ceci.
- Circe?

13:26.223 --> 13:28.225
You know what? Don't call me
anything. How about that?

13:28.392 --> 13:30.644
Ceci, my friend Patrick here
is doing me a favor by coming out

13:30.811 --> 13:34.231
here with me. So please behave.
<i>Por favor.</i>

13:34.773 --> 13:37.776
Uh, no. We got to get going.

13:37.943 --> 13:40.362
No, you're having a <i>pinche</i> beer
because you weren't raised by wolves.

13:40.529 --> 13:42.490
- I wouldn't mind having a beer.
- See?

13:42.656 --> 13:44.825
He wouldn't mind
having a beer.

13:44.992 --> 13:46.243
- Hey, Manny.
- Hey.

13:46.410 --> 13:47.745
Bring these dudes
some <i>chelas</i> from the fridge.

13:47.912 --> 13:50.206
<i>- Uno</i> beer. <i>Chelas?</i>
- Stop it.

13:50.372 --> 13:53.125
Okay,
that gave me life.

13:53.292 --> 13:55.503
I guess I have to pretend
I'm sick more often.

13:55.669 --> 13:58.214
- Do you do that a lot?
- What, play hooky?

13:58.380 --> 13:59.423
Mm-hmm.

13:59.632 --> 14:01.300
I've been known to play
the poz card now and again.

14:01.467 --> 14:04.178
It's the one positive thing
about being positive.

14:04.345 --> 14:06.472
HIV humor.
Jeez.

14:06.639 --> 14:09.433
This tat says I'm allowed.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.477
How long
you been poz for?

14:11.644 --> 14:13.729
Okay. No, see, we're not
gonna, like, sit down

14:13.896 --> 14:15.773
and do the Barbara Walters
interview thing.

14:15.940 --> 14:18.984
She's retired. You're not replacing
her, so sorry about it.

14:19.151 --> 14:21.403
Oh, my God, but you brought it up.
and if it was the other way around,

14:21.570 --> 14:23.405
it would've been one of the first
things you would've asked me

14:23.572 --> 14:24.823
when we met.

14:24.990 --> 14:28.494
Yeah, but I would've done it
charming and adorable.

14:28.661 --> 14:31.914
That wasn't charming?
That wasn't adorable?

14:32.081 --> 14:33.874
Fine. I've known
for about three years,

14:34.041 --> 14:36.043
so I guess I had it
a year before that.

14:37.628 --> 14:39.421
Do you know
how you got it?

14:40.548 --> 14:43.175
I was doing a lot of meth,

14:43.342 --> 14:45.970
and I was at this...

14:46.136 --> 14:48.639
...uh, dungeon sex party

14:48.806 --> 14:50.683
in a sling
as the courtesy bottom.

14:50.849 --> 14:54.478
So really it could've been any
number of guys who took their turns.

14:55.479 --> 14:58.148
Wow.

14:58.315 --> 14:59.900
I'm kidding.

15:00.067 --> 15:01.694
Jesus, Mary.

15:05.155 --> 15:06.240
All right.

15:06.407 --> 15:10.744
I got it from a guy who said he was
negative when he wasn't.

15:10.911 --> 15:12.580
A boyfriend at the time.

15:12.746 --> 15:13.956
Wow.

15:15.666 --> 15:17.585
Are you disappointed
it wasn't like

15:17.751 --> 15:20.504
"Bukkake Sex Pig Party
Part 666?"

15:20.671 --> 15:22.339
No, not at all.
Not at all.

15:22.506 --> 15:25.968
- Okay, good.
- What about your family?

15:26.135 --> 15:28.512
- What about them?
- Do they know?

15:28.679 --> 15:30.306
Mm, not yet.

15:30.472 --> 15:32.224
Well, what about your tattoo?

15:34.268 --> 15:36.979
I just tell them it's because
I'm a positive person.

15:37.146 --> 15:39.648
I mean,
I'm not lying, right?

15:41.191 --> 15:44.361
All right.
No more questions.

15:44.528 --> 15:46.864
Finally.

15:47.031 --> 15:49.742
Let's have some fun.

15:49.908 --> 15:51.327
What kind of fun?

15:54.079 --> 15:55.914
That's what you need
right there, <i>primo.</i>

15:56.081 --> 15:58.375
You need to get you one of those
good Mexican guys.

15:58.542 --> 16:01.503
<i>Ya pÃ¡rale</i> with these wishy-washy
white boys you keep dating

16:01.670 --> 16:03.589
who end up breaking
your heart every time.

16:03.756 --> 16:05.215
If you don't shut it,
we're leaving, <i>cabrona.</i>

16:05.382 --> 16:07.593
Hey, remember
the <i>gringo</i> with the Vespa?

16:07.760 --> 16:09.303
- You were a mess!
- Wait, there was a <i>gringo</i>

16:09.470 --> 16:11.138
with a Vespa? I wanna hear about
the <i>gringo</i> with a Vespa.

16:11.305 --> 16:13.557
Hey, Manny, let me borrow that rag
so I can shove it in her mouth.

16:13.724 --> 16:15.601
White guys are the fucking worst.
They walk around like

16:15.768 --> 16:18.312
they own everything.
I would never date a fucking <i>gringo.</i>

16:19.396 --> 16:22.107
I'm sorry-- Sorry, but isn't
that a little bit racist?

16:22.733 --> 16:23.817
Which part?

16:24.026 --> 16:25.986
What you just said
about white guys.

16:26.153 --> 16:27.821
She's just talking shit
to get at you.

16:27.988 --> 16:30.240
- She's dated plenty of white boys.
- So you were kidding.

16:30.407 --> 16:32.534
Was I?

16:32.701 --> 16:34.411
All right, <i>prima.</i>
It's been real, but we gotta jet.

16:34.578 --> 16:37.164
Hey, are you gonna pass by
your mom's before you go?

16:38.248 --> 16:40.668
No.

16:40.834 --> 16:44.380
And what? You're gonna leave and not
even ask about <i>La Adelita?</i>

16:46.048 --> 16:48.175
- Oh, damn!
- Wow.

16:48.342 --> 16:50.427
<i>Prima</i>, man, it looks beautiful.

16:50.594 --> 16:52.054
- It's incredible. Can I touch it?
- No.

16:52.221 --> 16:53.555
- Oh.
- You got the keys, Manny?

16:53.722 --> 16:55.349
- Did you do this all yourself, Ceci?
- Mm-hmm.

16:55.516 --> 16:57.184
It's a masterpiece.

16:57.351 --> 17:00.104
Hey. I know I've been
giving you a hard time,

17:00.270 --> 17:03.565
but I was just really
rooting for you.

17:03.732 --> 17:06.485
I've never seen him
be so into anyone.

17:06.652 --> 17:08.529
Well, not in a long time,
and then...

17:08.696 --> 17:10.447
...when he came
to borrow 200 bucks

17:10.614 --> 17:12.866
for some suit for some wedding
you were taking him to,

17:13.033 --> 17:14.868
that's when I knew.

17:16.954 --> 17:18.706
Too bad.

17:20.332 --> 17:22.334
- Hell yeah. You hear that?
- Yeah.

17:22.501 --> 17:24.169
Now that's
an engine.

17:53.657 --> 17:55.451
- What are you doing?
- What?

17:56.660 --> 17:58.078
Come on.

17:58.245 --> 18:00.164
Miami, I think you got
your signals crossed.

18:00.330 --> 18:02.499
Wait, wait, wait.
You play that specific song,

18:02.666 --> 18:04.209
You do that little
lip-synch for your life--

18:07.254 --> 18:09.840
And your huge cock flopping
around in your flimsy shorts

18:10.007 --> 18:13.135
and you're telling me
you're not throwing game at me.

18:13.302 --> 18:15.888
Newsflash: your hair's not
that curly and your skin's

18:16.054 --> 18:17.806
not that brown. Okay?

18:17.973 --> 18:20.350
All right, well...
you're telling me it's just me

18:20.517 --> 18:23.312
that was feeling
something happening between us?

18:23.479 --> 18:25.022
I'm sorry.

18:26.190 --> 18:28.734
I mean, I'm sorry if guys
take off their panties

18:28.901 --> 18:32.070
every time you say so...
but no.

18:34.114 --> 18:35.616
All right.

18:37.034 --> 18:39.036
I guess I'm officially
embarrassed.

18:40.662 --> 18:42.372
You should be
embarrassed.

18:42.539 --> 18:44.208
You give up
way too easily.

18:48.295 --> 18:50.380
But this isn't
anything official, okay?

18:50.547 --> 18:52.341
- Yeah, sure.
- This is just-- No, no.

18:52.508 --> 18:53.675
This is just me and you
fooling around

18:53.842 --> 18:55.803
because I like
your dance moves, all right?

19:02.643 --> 19:05.646
God, that music
is so creepy!

19:05.813 --> 19:08.941
It's like if the Addams Family
had an ice cream truck,

19:09.107 --> 19:10.734
and were pedophiles.

19:10.901 --> 19:13.737
Although Uncle Fester was
definitely a pedophile, right?

19:17.407 --> 19:19.034
Oops, sorry.

19:19.201 --> 19:20.452
Stop it.

19:20.619 --> 19:21.912
Quit it.

19:22.079 --> 19:24.623
We're not doing your whole,
Cheerleaders in a car wash fantasy.

19:24.790 --> 19:26.333
Oh, come on.
No wet t-shirts?

19:26.500 --> 19:27.668
Stop it.

19:27.835 --> 19:29.586
And it's frat guys
in a car wash.

19:29.753 --> 19:32.089
Is that you, Donado?

19:32.256 --> 19:33.966
Oh, shit.

19:35.717 --> 19:36.927
What's up, Hector?

19:37.094 --> 19:38.679
Hey, what are you selling
<i>paletas</i> these days?

19:38.846 --> 19:40.764
The salon business
must not be doing so good.

19:40.931 --> 19:43.058
Barber shop, not salon.
I work at a barber shop.

19:43.225 --> 19:45.561
Hey, how's your dad?

19:46.687 --> 19:48.313
You know, last time I saw him,
he looked real good.

19:48.480 --> 19:49.648
Oh, yeah?

19:49.815 --> 19:51.525
Hey, did you hear...

19:51.692 --> 19:54.236
...everybody came to the wedding.
It was real <i>suave.</i>

19:54.945 --> 19:56.864
We missed you, bro.
Yeah, I heard all about it.

19:57.030 --> 19:59.116
Hi, I'm Patrick.
Nice to meet you.

19:59.283 --> 20:00.993
Hi.

20:01.159 --> 20:03.495
Sorry. Is this, uh...

20:04.830 --> 20:07.124
- ...is this your dude?
- No, <i>cabrÃ³n</i>. He's a friend.

20:07.291 --> 20:09.334
Actually, I'm the--
what did your cousin say?

20:09.501 --> 20:11.753
I'm the <i>pinche puto...</i>

20:11.920 --> 20:13.380
...the ex.

20:15.299 --> 20:18.468
Shit.
This is the ex?

20:18.635 --> 20:20.137
You got something
to say about it, Hector?

20:20.304 --> 20:23.140
Nah, man.
Just thinking about your dad.

20:24.266 --> 20:26.101
Why don't you mind
your own fucking business, man?

20:26.268 --> 20:29.062
Easy, easy.
Live and let live.

20:31.523 --> 20:33.483
Look, I gotta get going.

20:33.650 --> 20:35.986
It was good
to see you, Ricardo.

20:36.153 --> 20:37.779
And the ex.

20:45.329 --> 20:48.373
I'm sorry about that.
That just came out.

20:48.540 --> 20:50.834
Why?
It's true, isn't it?

20:53.211 --> 20:55.005
That guy's a fucking asshole.

20:57.549 --> 21:00.135
Our ice cream truck
is way cooler than his car.

21:01.178 --> 21:02.262
In my opinion.

21:02.429 --> 21:04.932
Hey, watch it.

21:05.098 --> 21:06.934
Now you want to play.

21:09.853 --> 21:12.731
So this thing with your dad
is like legit bad, huh?

21:14.358 --> 21:16.151
Just complicated.

21:17.444 --> 21:19.196
Have you ever thought
about talking to him?

21:21.281 --> 21:23.200
No offense, Patrick, but you don't
know shit about my dad.

21:23.367 --> 21:24.701
No, I know.
I know.

21:24.868 --> 21:28.163
But I know you...

21:28.330 --> 21:30.916
and if your dad
is anything like you...

21:31.083 --> 21:33.585
- Where you going with this?
- No, just...

21:33.752 --> 21:37.214
You have a slight tendency
sometimes to just be a little...

21:37.381 --> 21:38.507
What?

21:38.674 --> 21:41.385
- ...just a little stubborn.
- Uh, excuse me?

21:41.551 --> 21:44.012
Just a little bit.
No, you know that you are.

21:47.265 --> 21:49.351
Just a little.

21:49.518 --> 21:52.062
I confronted my mom
and things are better.

21:52.229 --> 21:54.523
I mean, they're not completely,
but definitely improving.

21:54.690 --> 21:56.566
Yeah, well, my dad
isn't your mom.

21:56.733 --> 21:58.568
He comes from a totally
different world than your mom.

21:58.735 --> 22:00.028
You saw it here today.

22:00.195 --> 22:02.030
No, I know it's not
the same at all,

22:02.197 --> 22:04.574
and I didn't mean
to imply that it is, but...

22:04.741 --> 22:07.452
...at the same time...

22:07.619 --> 22:09.371
I don't know.
I know what it's like

22:09.538 --> 22:13.542
to feel like you can't be yourself
when you go home.

22:13.709 --> 22:15.002
And so you
either stay away

22:15.168 --> 22:18.672
or you go home
and kind of pretend.

22:18.839 --> 22:20.424
Yeah, well, that's what
I don't wanna do anymore.

22:20.590 --> 22:23.552
- I don't want to pretend.
- Yeah, so you stay away.

22:23.719 --> 22:26.555
But then if you're
anything like me,

22:26.722 --> 22:28.598
you kind of want to go home
because it's your family.

22:28.765 --> 22:30.767
Right?
So...

22:30.934 --> 22:33.812
...I don't know, you're kind of
forced to confront it.

22:35.272 --> 22:37.149
But still, my dad,
he's just...

22:37.315 --> 22:38.608
...fucking tough.

22:38.775 --> 22:41.111
Well, listen, if your dad
is a raging homophobe,

22:41.278 --> 22:43.280
then I say
fuck him, okay?

22:43.447 --> 22:47.784
Never speak to him again,
but what if he's not?

22:47.951 --> 22:50.078
Then...
I don't know.

22:50.245 --> 22:52.247
You're annoying,
you know that?

22:52.414 --> 22:54.458
You know that, don't you?

22:54.624 --> 22:56.043
So fucking annoying.

22:56.209 --> 22:58.253
Sometimes people
will tell me that, yes.

22:59.963 --> 23:01.715
If you think this is going to get me
to change my mind

23:01.798 --> 23:02.799
and go see my dad today--

23:02.883 --> 23:04.384
No, not at all.
I'm not expecting that.

23:04.551 --> 23:06.803
Although that would mean I'd get
to see your childhood bedroom,

23:06.970 --> 23:09.389
which I'm all about.
But, no, that's a different visit.

23:09.556 --> 23:12.100
I'm just-- I'm just saying
you should think about it.

23:16.980 --> 23:18.648
I think it's time to go.

23:21.943 --> 23:24.613
Oh, my God.
This music is crazy.

23:24.780 --> 23:27.532
It's endlessly
horrifying every time.

23:27.699 --> 23:29.701
I love it.
I hope they keep it.

23:29.868 --> 23:31.745
Turn it off.

23:34.664 --> 23:36.708
Thank you for doing this,
by the way.

23:36.875 --> 23:39.127
If we make it back alive,
I owe you.

23:39.294 --> 23:41.546
I want to
tell you something.

23:41.713 --> 23:43.882
Will you let me
tell you something?

23:44.049 --> 23:45.550
Depends on what it is.

23:45.717 --> 23:47.886
I need to apologize...

23:48.887 --> 23:50.972
...for what happened with us,
you know, how it ended.

23:51.139 --> 23:54.226
Then no, you can't.
Just keep driving

23:54.392 --> 23:55.769
- and be quiet.
- No, no. Seriously.

23:55.936 --> 23:59.272
These last few months have been
so fraught with grossness

23:59.439 --> 24:02.025
that I need to at least try to be
honest for like two minutes.

24:02.192 --> 24:03.902
Or you could just say nothing
and I could buy you

24:04.069 --> 24:05.862
that beer like I promised.

24:06.029 --> 24:08.698
No, listen,
when Ceci told me

24:08.865 --> 24:10.659
about how you borrowed
the money for that suit--

24:10.826 --> 24:13.203
Fuck that mouth of hers. She is not
getting that money.

24:13.370 --> 24:16.456
No, no, no. It just reminded me how
fucking sweet and amazing you were,

24:16.623 --> 24:20.710
not just that day, but the entire
time we were together.

24:20.877 --> 24:23.755
- This is not a good idea, Patrick.
- No, listen. I...

24:24.881 --> 24:27.801
That night that we were standing
in front of my apartment,

24:27.968 --> 24:29.678
I just...

24:29.845 --> 24:33.723
...I need you to know that it wasn't
because I didn't like you enough,

24:33.890 --> 24:37.894
and it wasn't because I couldn't
imagine us together in the future.

24:38.061 --> 24:41.857
It's just that when you asked me
if I was ready...

24:45.485 --> 24:47.571
...it was a complicated night.

24:49.239 --> 24:51.783
- What do you mean?
- It was just very...

24:53.535 --> 24:56.037
- Very what?
- ...fucked up and confusing.

24:56.204 --> 24:59.541
Okay? I didn't know what was
happening with us, and...

25:00.834 --> 25:02.919
...I was at work
right before I saw you,

25:03.086 --> 25:07.424
and Kevin and me,
we...

25:08.717 --> 25:10.010
Hooked up.

25:11.636 --> 25:12.846
Yeah, but I
need you to know

25:13.013 --> 25:14.806
that it's nothing that ever
happened before...

25:14.931 --> 25:17.559
- I fucking knew it.
- ...and it's not something I planned.

25:18.727 --> 25:20.729
I'm not trying
to make an excuse

25:20.896 --> 25:23.773
or say that it didn't mean anything
because obviously...

25:25.650 --> 25:28.403
I just wanted to say that I'm...

25:28.570 --> 25:31.114
...sorry, okay?
I never apologized--

25:31.281 --> 25:32.490
You got drumsticks?

25:32.657 --> 25:35.452
- What?
- Drumsticks. I want drumsticks.

25:36.620 --> 25:38.163
Get out of here, kid.

25:42.792 --> 25:44.044
You're not gonna

25:44.211 --> 25:45.837
punch me in the face now,
are you?

25:46.004 --> 25:47.923
Or make me walk home?

25:51.134 --> 25:54.179
- Let's just go back to the city.
- That's all you're gonna say?

25:56.681 --> 25:58.433
It's in the past.

26:00.560 --> 26:03.313
And, yeah, it doesn't feel great,
but I mean...

26:04.397 --> 26:06.608
...you had something
with Kevin, right?

26:07.901 --> 26:10.278
And I'm with Brady now,

26:10.445 --> 26:12.239
and I like him.

26:16.493 --> 26:18.286
The truth is...

26:20.205 --> 26:22.332
despite you being a...

26:27.379 --> 26:30.006
...I would be very sad if you weren't
in my life any more.

26:34.177 --> 26:35.595
Me too.

26:39.349 --> 26:41.434
So does that mean
we're friends?

26:43.979 --> 26:45.438
We'll try to be.

26:55.240 --> 26:57.575
I'll take friends.

27:00.620 --> 27:03.206
Wait!
I want my drumstick!
