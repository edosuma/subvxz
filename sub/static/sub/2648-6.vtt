WEBVTT

00:04.213 --> 00:06.454
Oh, hi, honey.
Breakfast will be ready in a minute.

00:07.549 --> 00:11.049
Aaah! My hand!

00:11.136 --> 00:13.592
Aaah!

00:13.680 --> 00:16.468
Very funny, Mom. I know it's Halloween.

00:16.558 --> 00:18.302
Nice fake hand.

00:18.393 --> 00:20.967
 Aaah! Aaah!

00:23.232 --> 00:26.647
We love Halloween, especially Claire.

00:26.735 --> 00:28.811
It's my favorite holiday.

00:28.904 --> 00:31.477
Ever since I was a kid,
I loved scary things.

00:31.573 --> 00:33.281
If there was a new horror movie in town...

00:33.367 --> 00:35.158
I was the first in line.

00:35.244 --> 00:37.035
- One, please.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.698
Then I met Phil.

00:38.789 --> 00:40.283
Two, please.

00:40.958 --> 00:42.831
<i># Hey, hey #</i>

00:42.918 --> 00:44.875
<i># Hey, hey #</i>

00:44.962 --> 00:46.919
<i># Hey, hey #</i>

00:47.005 --> 00:48.998
<i># Hey, hey #</i>

00:49.091 --> 00:50.087
<i># Hey ##.</i>

00:53.470 --> 00:54.964
Okay.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.628
All right, do me. Do me, do me, do me.

00:57.724 --> 00:59.682
- Cam, I have to say, I feel kinda sexy.

00:59.768 --> 01:02.057
Well, squeaky sexy, but...

01:02.145 --> 01:06.013
You know I'd be enjoying this more if
Halloween wasn't such a tough day for me.

01:06.108 --> 01:08.859
But I want you to go to work...

01:08.944 --> 01:10.604
and knock their socks off.

01:10.696 --> 01:13.447
My last job was
at a pretty conservative law firm.

01:13.532 --> 01:15.359
<i>No one there would ever</i>
<i>dress up for Halloween.</i>

01:15.450 --> 01:17.657
<i>But apparently, at
this new company...</i>

01:17.744 --> 01:21.445
Right now I'm thinkin'
either vampire or werewolf.

01:21.540 --> 01:23.283
Every year it's harder to decide.

01:23.375 --> 01:24.869
Wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.834
So people really come
to work in costumes here?

01:26.920 --> 01:29.921
- Are you kidding? It's epic, bro.
- Epic.

01:31.216 --> 01:32.710
<i>I'm already the new guy.</i>

01:32.801 --> 01:35.375
I don't want to be
the non-participation guy too.

01:35.470 --> 01:37.095
Not on my watch.

01:37.181 --> 01:41.344
Unfortunately, Halloween was marred
for me personally by an incident long ago.

01:41.435 --> 01:44.519
- Now it's just a day I have to get through.
- So you said.

01:44.605 --> 01:48.056
All right, so everybody has to be here at
5:30 to rehearse our house of horrors.

01:48.150 --> 01:50.641
- You guys have your costumes ready?
- Yeah, but it's a secret.

01:50.736 --> 01:52.859
Me and Manny came up
with something together.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.440
I love that.

01:54.531 --> 01:57.069
- Can I have some candy?
- No. How about you, Alex?

01:57.159 --> 02:00.528
I haven't really thought about it. I've
got, like, three huge exams tomorrow.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.909
Honey, you can't just slap something
together at the last minute.

02:02.998 --> 02:04.907
If you gave this costume
half as much time and attention...

02:05.000 --> 02:07.787
as you give your homework,
you wouldn't be in this situation.

02:07.878 --> 02:10.120
Can I remind you
you have one child who's not mediocre?

02:10.214 --> 02:13.049
Check it. I'm a scary black cat.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.007
The only person
that costume scares is me.

02:15.093 --> 02:16.588
- Go change it.
- To what?

02:16.678 --> 02:18.920
I don't know. One of your old costumes.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.135
I am sparing you an entire day...

02:22.226 --> 02:24.349
of guys asking you
if you have a rough tongue.

02:24.436 --> 02:26.061
Eww.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.269
- <i>  Yello.</i>
- Hi, Dad. It's me.

02:28.357 --> 02:30.563
I wanted to make sure
you and Gloria were ready for tonight.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.394
- What's tonight?
- <i>What do you mean, what is tonight?</i>

02:32.486 --> 02:34.110
Dad, it's Halloween. You know this.

02:34.196 --> 02:36.438
Calm down, Morticia. I'm just teasing you.

02:36.532 --> 02:39.023
- <i>We'll be there.</i>
- Yeah, but in costume this time.

02:39.117 --> 02:41.240
You can't just show up
with a backwards baseball cap...

02:41.328 --> 02:43.285
and call yourself Snoop Dogg,
like you did last year.

02:43.372 --> 02:45.032
I didn't even know who that guy was.

02:45.123 --> 02:47.033
Haley turned my hat around
and told me to say it.

02:47.125 --> 02:48.703
I thought he was a dog detective.

02:48.794 --> 02:50.288
Listen, don't worry.

02:50.379 --> 02:52.252
We got the whole thing worked out.

02:52.339 --> 02:54.581
- Bye-bye.

02:56.301 --> 02:57.796
- <i>Hola,</i> Jay.
- Where are you?

02:57.886 --> 03:00.377
I have Manny in the carpool,
and we're going to the dropout.

03:00.472 --> 03:02.714
Dropout... You mean that Eddie kid?
Yeah, he's a moron.

03:02.808 --> 03:06.224
No, the dropout,
where you drop the kids in the school.

03:06.311 --> 03:07.806
She means "drop-off."

03:07.896 --> 03:09.474
That's what I said.

03:09.565 --> 03:13.147
Listen. Did you ever do anything
about costumes for Claire's thing tonight?

03:13.235 --> 03:14.859
<i>I'm going to pick them
up this afternoon.</i>

03:14.945 --> 03:16.487
You're going to be a gargle...

03:16.572 --> 03:18.398
and I'm going to be an
evil village <i>bruja.</i>

03:18.490 --> 03:20.898
- I know less now than I did before I asked.
- Hmm.

03:20.993 --> 03:23.531
A <i>bruja</i> is a witch,
and a gargle is a gargle.

03:23.620 --> 03:26.290
- She means "gargoyle."
- That's what I said.

03:26.373 --> 03:27.867
<i>As long as you got it covered...</i>

03:27.958 --> 03:29.582
because if Claire
doesn't get her Halloween...

03:29.668 --> 03:32.455
she turns into a real
rhymes with <i>bruja.</i>

03:32.546 --> 03:34.918
Oh, no. No, no, no.

03:35.007 --> 03:36.501
- I'm the only one.

03:40.137 --> 03:41.964
 Hey, someone's got the spirit.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.682
Look at those tools.

03:44.766 --> 03:47.092
Every year. What a couple of douches.

03:47.186 --> 03:49.095
- Oh, no.
- <i> </i>

03:50.689 --> 03:52.598
<i>There are exactly three people</i>
<i>in costume here...</i>

03:52.691 --> 03:54.767
a tool, a douche and me...

03:54.860 --> 03:56.603
and I don't have time
to go home and change.

03:56.695 --> 03:58.189
<i>Calm down.</i>

03:58.280 --> 04:00.154
Did you bring in
the dry cleaning from last night?

04:00.240 --> 04:01.984
Are you really getting on me
about the dry clean...

04:02.075 --> 04:03.700
Oh, I have suits in the trunk.

04:03.785 --> 04:06.656
Look at that.
Yesterday's lazy cures today's crazy.

04:06.747 --> 04:09.416
 Yes, thank you. Thank you.

04:09.499 --> 04:10.828
Okay.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.997
- Hey, Charlie.
- There you are. I need you in the Lampkin meeting.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.584
- If I could just maybe...
- Five minutes.

04:17.673 --> 04:19.168
- Okay.
- Okay, hey...

04:19.259 --> 04:20.718
- First legal question.
- Yeah?

04:20.802 --> 04:22.546
Can I fire those idiots for no reason?

04:22.638 --> 04:24.132
Oh, my gosh.

04:24.223 --> 04:27.426
- Those are some major guns you got there.

04:34.566 --> 04:36.060
Why won't this...

04:38.070 --> 04:40.561
Hey, Phil. Lookin' good.

04:40.656 --> 04:43.775
Thanks. Wait'll you see
what we got planned for tonight.

04:43.867 --> 04:46.109
Claire and I are goin'
as Corpse Bride and groom...

04:46.203 --> 04:48.955
As if there's any other kind. Am I right?

04:49.039 --> 04:51.115
- I'm saying that marriage kills you.
- Judy left me.

04:52.084 --> 04:54.705
Oh, my God. I am so sorry.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.712
When someone your age dies,
what's the first thing you wanna know?

04:57.798 --> 04:59.506
Died of what? Right?

04:59.591 --> 05:01.999
You wanna hear it was something
that could never happen to you.

05:02.094 --> 05:03.754
It's the same with divorce.

05:03.846 --> 05:08.009
Tell me it was booze, cheating,
physical abuse... no problem.

05:08.100 --> 05:11.433
I'm a monogamous social drinker,
and Claire only sleep-hits me.

05:11.520 --> 05:14.272
Just don't tell me
it came from out of the blue.

05:14.356 --> 05:16.514
I was totally blindsided.

05:16.608 --> 05:18.435
I guess somewhere along the way...

05:18.527 --> 05:20.270
she stopped finding me delightful.

05:20.362 --> 05:23.612
Well, that's... That's coconuts.
You're super-delightful.

05:23.699 --> 05:25.359
Not to Judy.

05:25.450 --> 05:27.657
She used to laugh
at everything I had to say...

05:27.744 --> 05:30.449
but now I can't even remember
what her laugh sounds like.

05:30.539 --> 05:32.116
Claire can do it. It's uncan...

05:33.876 --> 05:35.619
I should go back inside.

05:35.711 --> 05:37.371
I have a dish to wash.

05:37.462 --> 05:40.713
Okay, but, hey, Jerry,
if you need anything...

05:40.799 --> 05:43.041
All right? I'm your rock.

05:48.056 --> 05:50.132
You are not gonna believe this.

05:50.225 --> 05:51.719
Judy just left Jerry.

05:51.810 --> 05:54.135
Oh, yeah. She was so unhappy.

05:54.229 --> 05:57.396
- How's he doing?
- He's not taking it as well as you are.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.559
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
I don't mean to be insensitive.

05:59.651 --> 06:01.443
I've just got a lot to get done.

06:01.528 --> 06:03.188
I don't find you insensitive.

06:03.280 --> 06:04.988
I find you delightful.

06:05.073 --> 06:07.446
- Do you find me delightful?
- Oh, God, I just remembered...

06:07.534 --> 06:09.527
Jerry's supposed to be
our porch scarecrow.

06:09.620 --> 06:11.328
Can you ask him if he'll still do it?

06:11.413 --> 06:13.240
He's kind of a mess right now.

06:13.332 --> 06:16.416
Yeah, but... it might
make him feel better to be around people.

06:17.711 --> 06:20.629
I'll try, but his whole world
just turned upside down.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.339
Can you imagine?

06:22.424 --> 06:24.132
One minute you're happily married.

06:24.218 --> 06:26.424
The next minute
you're completely by yourself...

06:34.228 --> 06:36.434
I don't need excuses.
I need this lawsuit to go away.

06:36.522 --> 06:38.431
Now who's responsible
for the Keith deposition?

06:38.524 --> 06:42.817
  Uh, well, I was, sir.
But in my defense, I was told...

06:42.903 --> 06:45.524
Take those stupid fangs out, Dale.

06:45.614 --> 06:47.772
- Sorry.
- For starters, it's daytime.

06:47.866 --> 06:49.491
Vampires sleep during the day...

06:49.576 --> 06:51.450
which you may soon
have plenty of time for.

06:51.537 --> 06:54.241
I'm sorry, but I was told
that we didn't need Keith.

06:54.331 --> 06:55.790
Who told you that?

06:55.874 --> 06:57.950
 I-I may have...

06:58.043 --> 07:00.878
- I may have done that, sir.
- That's disappointing.

07:00.963 --> 07:02.671
But at least Mitchell's new here.

07:02.756 --> 07:05.508
Twilight, you're not, so get it done.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.051
Meeting adjourned.

07:07.135 --> 07:09.377
Client's waiting for us in my office.
We're already late.

07:09.471 --> 07:10.930
Let's roll.

07:11.014 --> 07:12.758
- Wow. You've really been hittin' the gym.
- Yeah, well...

07:15.561 --> 07:17.470
Every time I tried
to get out of that costume...

07:17.563 --> 07:19.389
I got dragged into another meeting.

07:19.481 --> 07:22.731
It was the worst Halloween ever.

07:22.818 --> 07:25.523
Really, Mitchell?
The worst Halloween ever?

07:25.612 --> 07:28.779
You had squeaky thighs.
I lost a childhood.

07:29.533 --> 07:31.193
Jay! This came for you.

07:31.285 --> 07:33.408
Oh, hi, honey. What is it?

07:33.495 --> 07:35.369
I called your secretary and told her...

07:35.455 --> 07:38.243
to order you some crackers
and those cheeses that you like.

07:38.333 --> 07:40.207
- The tiny little ones.
- Thanks.

07:40.294 --> 07:42.535
Did you pick up my gargle costume too?

07:42.629 --> 07:44.705
- Are you making fun of me?
- No.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.467
First Manny correcting me, and now you?

07:47.551 --> 07:50.089
- If I have a problem, I want to know, Jay.
- Honey, look.

07:50.179 --> 07:52.800
English is your second language.
You're doin' great.

07:52.890 --> 07:56.590
Yeah, you're not helping
by protecting my feelings.

07:56.685 --> 07:58.476
I want you to be honest with me.

07:58.562 --> 08:00.104
Okay, well, I may have noticed...

08:00.189 --> 08:02.893
some tiny little mistakes
you might want to take a look at.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.059
- Like what?
- Just little mispronunciations.

08:05.152 --> 08:08.022
Like, for example, last night
you said we live in a "doggy-dog" world.

08:08.113 --> 08:11.149
- So?
- It's "dog-eat-dog" world.

08:11.241 --> 08:12.901
Yeah, but...

08:12.993 --> 08:14.618
that doesn't make any sense.

08:14.703 --> 08:17.574
Who wants to live in a world
where dogs eat each other?

08:17.664 --> 08:22.125
Doggy-dog world is a beautiful world
full of little puppies.

08:22.211 --> 08:23.871
What else do I say wrong?

08:25.255 --> 08:27.331
Well, it's not "blessings in the skies."

08:27.424 --> 08:29.298
It's "blessings in disguise."

08:29.885 --> 08:31.463
What else?

08:31.553 --> 08:34.673
"Carpal tunnel syndrome"
is not "carpool tunnel syndrome."

08:35.390 --> 08:36.885
And what else?

08:38.018 --> 08:40.342
- It's not "vo-lump-tuous."
- Okay, enough.

08:40.437 --> 08:43.936
I know that I have an accent,
but people understand me just fine.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.978
- What the hell is this?
- I told you, Jay.

08:47.069 --> 08:50.485
I called your secretary and told her
to order you a box of baby cheeses.

08:52.908 --> 08:55.577
Oh, so now that is my fault too.

08:59.122 --> 09:03.167
Can you tell Claire that I'm not really up
for being a scarecrow?

09:03.252 --> 09:04.995
Judy and I used to love Halloween.

09:05.087 --> 09:06.546
It's her favorite holiday.

09:06.630 --> 09:07.793
- Huh.
- You know?

09:07.881 --> 09:09.838
Gosh. I hate to think of you
sitting in there alone...

09:09.925 --> 09:12.546
running through all this in your head...
what could you have done differently?

09:13.637 --> 09:15.012
What <i>could</i> you
have done differently?

09:15.097 --> 09:16.888
It's actually a little hard
for me to talk about.

09:16.974 --> 09:18.847
Don't push me away. I'm not Judy.

09:20.102 --> 09:22.675
- I could have been more spontaneous.
- Uh-huh.

09:22.771 --> 09:25.606
I could have tried
to have been more fun and sexy...

09:25.691 --> 09:27.185
like it was in the old days.

09:27.276 --> 09:29.352
Spontaneous and sexy. I got it. Yup.

09:29.444 --> 09:31.651
Remember. I'm here for you, okay?

09:36.076 --> 09:37.570
What the hell is that?

09:37.661 --> 09:40.152
What? You told me
to put on an old costume.

09:40.247 --> 09:41.907
Not from when you were eight.

09:41.999 --> 09:43.742
Are you trying to get candy
or Japanese businessmen?

09:43.834 --> 09:45.743
Change it. Go.

09:47.296 --> 09:50.581
Jerry is a no-go on the 'crow.

09:50.674 --> 09:52.334
- You've been over there this whole time?
- Yeah.

09:52.426 --> 09:54.465
He was venting. I couldn't break free.

09:54.553 --> 09:56.546
God. You are sexy.

09:56.638 --> 09:58.548
- Honey?
- Not so fast.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.099
I don't think we're done here, my darlin'.

10:00.184 --> 10:01.678
Sweet pea, I need to get down.

10:01.768 --> 10:03.512
Oh, we can get down.
We can get way down.

10:03.604 --> 10:05.845
Oh, God! Phil!

10:18.952 --> 10:21.194
No. No, no, no, no, no!

10:24.791 --> 10:28.326
- Okay.

10:37.513 --> 10:39.007
Okay.

10:51.902 --> 10:54.227
No. No, no, no, no.

10:54.321 --> 10:55.946
Okay.

10:56.031 --> 10:57.940
Okay, focus, Mitchell. Focus, focus.

11:02.371 --> 11:05.288
<i>I'm trapped in a men's room,</i> <i>and
all I have on is the Spider-Man suit.</i>

11:05.374 --> 11:06.868
Hot. Who is this?

11:06.959 --> 11:09.960
Somebody took my shirt, and all the rest
of my clothes are all "toilety."

11:10.045 --> 11:12.536
- I'm screwed.
- Why don't you just tell Charlie the truth?

11:12.631 --> 11:16.166
I can't. I already messed up once today,
and I can't risk it.

11:16.260 --> 11:17.754
I have another suit in my trunk...

11:17.845 --> 11:19.921
but I can't get to the car
without going through the office.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.472
You know what's ironic?

11:21.557 --> 11:23.882
Who could really help you now
is Spider-Man.

11:29.439 --> 11:30.934
He's here.

11:47.374 --> 11:50.624
Okay. Okay. Okay.

11:50.711 --> 11:52.668
No. No, no, no, no, no.

12:13.734 --> 12:13.775
Behold my creation!

12:13.775 --> 12:15.768
Behold my creation!

12:15.861 --> 12:17.853
Monster, do my bidding.

12:17.946 --> 12:20.520
I do as you command, master.

12:20.616 --> 12:23.949
Okay, Mom, you cannot
have a problem with this.

12:24.036 --> 12:25.530
I'm Mother Teresa.

12:25.621 --> 12:29.203
- Are you kidding me?
- What? I'm her back when she was hot.

12:29.291 --> 12:31.414
I will pay you $10
to go put on more clothes.

12:31.502 --> 12:33.411
Bet it's the first time
you ever heard that one.

12:33.504 --> 12:35.496
Okay, you know what? Here. Here we go.

12:36.381 --> 12:38.041
Let's just cover you up.

12:38.133 --> 12:42.380
All right, now. I just wanna run through
this really quick with everybody.

12:42.471 --> 12:44.131
Uh, first it's "Trick or treat"...

12:44.223 --> 12:45.883
- and then Phil...
- "Come in, if you dare."

12:45.974 --> 12:49.639
Right, and then Dad does
the thunder and the lightning and the fog.

12:49.728 --> 12:52.349
Usher the children in,
past Alex in her cage...

12:52.439 --> 12:54.147
- I'm in a cage?
- Yes.

12:54.233 --> 12:56.272
You're in a house of horrors,
being held against your will.

12:56.360 --> 12:58.233
Yeah, I know.
So why do we need the cage?

12:58.320 --> 13:03.065
And then Gloria pops up as the evil
village <i>bruja</i> and she says...

13:03.158 --> 13:06.408
"Welcome to your nightmare."  

13:06.495 --> 13:08.618
And then Cam and Haley do their thing.

13:08.705 --> 13:10.248
Kids get their candy.
They are ushered out.

13:10.332 --> 13:12.159
They think it's all over, but it's not...

13:12.251 --> 13:15.121
because out on the porch,
the scarecrow pops to life...

13:15.212 --> 13:17.619
Pow! For one final "aah!"

13:17.714 --> 13:19.956
- And that's Mitchell. You're the scarecrow.
- Oh, no.

13:20.050 --> 13:21.959
No. I was in a costume all day.
It was awful.

13:22.052 --> 13:23.879
It's nothing compared to when I was...

13:23.971 --> 13:26.129
- You don't own bad Halloweens.
- Don't I?

13:26.223 --> 13:27.847
We get it, Cam. Hard day.

13:27.933 --> 13:29.593
Mitchell, please.
The costume's in the kitchen.

13:29.685 --> 13:31.345
- Come on.

13:31.436 --> 13:32.931
 All right.
- Claire. Claire.

13:33.021 --> 13:34.979
- Before you go, I just want you to know...
- Okay, the wig.

13:35.065 --> 13:36.559
- I love you more...
- That's-That's...

13:36.650 --> 13:38.441
- Thanks, honey.
- You're my best friend!

13:39.653 --> 13:41.112
 Hey, guys.
- Hey.

13:41.196 --> 13:43.521
Wow. God, you guys look great.

13:43.615 --> 13:45.941
Thank you, Phil. I try my best.

13:46.034 --> 13:48.241
You look very dead-like.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.072
Gloria, stop it. I said I was sorry.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.622
Oh, no, no, Jay.

13:51.707 --> 13:55.289
For now on, I only speakin'
proper American...

13:55.377 --> 13:57.785
so I don't embarrass you.

13:58.839 --> 14:00.298
Did she just get back from the dentist?

14:00.382 --> 14:02.173
She's mad at me because I told her...

14:02.259 --> 14:04.252
sometimes people can't understand her.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.969
Make it right, Jay.

14:06.054 --> 14:07.714
We're all just hanging by a thread.

14:07.806 --> 14:09.799
Hey, Dad! Oh, you look great.

14:09.892 --> 14:11.552
Oh, good. Okay, Gloria's in position.

14:11.643 --> 14:13.470
Hi, Gloria. Here you go. Right back here.

14:13.562 --> 14:15.887
Claire, I don't know that
I'm feeling up to this.

14:15.981 --> 14:17.475
Why, Cam?

14:17.566 --> 14:19.440
What happened that is so awful...

14:19.526 --> 14:21.353
you simultaneously can't speak of it...

14:21.445 --> 14:23.105
and yet can't stop talking about it?

14:23.197 --> 14:25.403
- I can't. It's too emotional.
- Okay. Some other time.

14:25.490 --> 14:26.819
- I was 10.
- Oh, God.

14:26.909 --> 14:28.486
Dressed as Quasimodo,
on a front porch...

14:28.577 --> 14:31.531
with my best friend, Timmy Reglar...
a Ghostbuster.

14:31.622 --> 14:33.448
There was a bucket of candy with a sign.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.497
- It said "Take one."
- One.

14:35.584 --> 14:37.909
- Timmy took the entire bucket and put it in his bag.
- Mmm.

14:38.003 --> 14:40.838
Timmy didn't play by the rules.
It's what I liked and feared about him.

14:40.923 --> 14:42.915
- Oh.
- Then the bag broke.

14:43.008 --> 14:46.342
As a crowd of kids rounded the corner,
saw the pile of candy...

14:46.428 --> 14:48.136
Timmy said, "Cam did it!"

14:48.222 --> 14:49.846
Trick or treat!

14:49.932 --> 14:51.640
Oh, good.
Aren't you glad you got that out?

14:51.725 --> 14:55.011
Okay, everybody, our first victims.
This is not a rehearsal.

14:55.103 --> 14:56.598
 You ready? You ready?
- Yes. Yes.

14:56.688 --> 14:57.851
Okay.

14:57.940 --> 15:01.309
Come in, if you dare.

15:03.403 --> 15:06.357
- Dad.
 Huh? Oh. Let me see...

15:06.448 --> 15:09.200
Thank you for joining us on our...

15:09.284 --> 15:11.076
No, no, no.
First the thunder and the lightning.

15:11.161 --> 15:13.035
Yeah, right. I got it.

15:13.121 --> 15:14.201
Perfect.

15:14.289 --> 15:18.536
Thank you for joining us
on our special night.

15:18.627 --> 15:22.043
Other children haven't fared so well.

15:22.130 --> 15:25.665
  Welcome to your nightmare.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

15:26.426 --> 15:27.885
What the hell is that?

15:27.970 --> 15:29.547
Can we just get our candy?

15:29.638 --> 15:35.059
Okay, but beware of the fog,
for you might not be able to see ahead.

15:37.145 --> 15:39.387
Timmy starting running.
I wanted to run too...

15:39.481 --> 15:42.233
but my hunch got stuck
on a rosebush, and that's when I fell.

15:42.317 --> 15:43.432
I fell hard.

15:43.527 --> 15:45.021
I can see his feet.

15:45.112 --> 15:48.445
Okay, here.
Here, children, have some candy.

15:48.532 --> 15:50.489
Happy Halloween.

15:53.495 --> 15:55.618
Okay, that was bad. That was a bad start.

15:55.706 --> 15:59.573
Uh, first of all, Dad,
thunder, lightning, fog cue...

15:59.668 --> 16:01.162
And we skipped Alex altogether.

16:01.253 --> 16:04.207
And Gloria, since when
do you speak English?

16:04.298 --> 16:08.592
Oh, so now you have
a problem with the way I speak?

16:08.677 --> 16:12.378
Like father, like daughter
in this dog-eat-dog family.

16:14.016 --> 16:16.589
Okay, places! Places!
Good. Mitchell's good.

16:16.685 --> 16:18.263
Honey, I love you so much...

16:18.353 --> 16:20.311
Not now. Not now.

16:20.397 --> 16:23.398
Come in, if you dare.

16:24.193 --> 16:25.603
- Dad.
 What?

16:25.694 --> 16:27.521
- Dad!
- Oh, right, right.

16:27.613 --> 16:29.273
<i> </i>

16:29.364 --> 16:31.690
- Phil, that's you.
- No, Dad... Fog, fog.

16:31.783 --> 16:35.698
Thank you for joining us
on our special night.

16:35.787 --> 16:39.239
Other children haven't fared so well.

16:39.333 --> 16:42.334
Oh, help me. Help me.

16:42.419 --> 16:46.464
  Welcome to your nightmare.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

16:46.548 --> 16:48.624
Now your treats are over here...

16:48.717 --> 16:54.222
but with all the fog,
you may not be able to see... ahead.

16:54.306 --> 16:57.058
And everyone was screaming,
"That's him! Get Quasimodo!"

16:57.142 --> 17:01.471
And then the townspeople started chasing
me and that's when I wet my pants!

17:01.563 --> 17:04.233
I wet my pants! I wet my pants.

17:05.317 --> 17:07.144
- This place is weird.
- Yeah.

17:07.236 --> 17:08.730
- Let's go.
- Yeah, come on.

17:12.324 --> 17:15.194
- Son of a...
- What is wrong with everyone?

17:15.285 --> 17:16.944
Cam, "townspeople"? Really?

17:17.037 --> 17:18.531
I lived on a farm. They lived in town.

17:18.622 --> 17:20.116
They <i>were</i> the townspeople.

17:20.207 --> 17:24.417
And Dad...
Dad, it goes lightning, thunder, fog cue.

17:24.502 --> 17:27.076
This whole thing is a colossal fog cue.

17:27.172 --> 17:29.924
Claire just doesn't understand, Cam.

17:30.008 --> 17:33.923
Maybe she's never been picked on
for been different.

17:34.012 --> 17:35.672
When, Gloria?

17:35.764 --> 17:39.180
When have you ever been picked on
for "been different"?

17:39.268 --> 17:41.509
Ask the gargle.

17:41.603 --> 17:43.263
What is she saying?

17:44.356 --> 17:45.387
Gloria!

17:46.733 --> 17:49.485
 Think she went insane.
- She's not insane!

17:49.570 --> 17:52.487
- She's my mother.
- I'm your mother now!

17:53.866 --> 17:56.866
Gloria, I wanna tell you a story...

17:56.952 --> 17:58.861
about a guy eating in a diner, alone.

17:58.954 --> 18:02.240
Behind him he hears a woman talking.
He doesn't turn around.

18:02.332 --> 18:07.290
Five minutes, 10 minutes, just listening
for the woman, the life in her voice.

18:07.379 --> 18:11.080
And before he even sees her,
he realizes he's fallen in love.

18:11.175 --> 18:13.333
Now I give you a guess who that guy is.

18:17.097 --> 18:18.046
Oh, my dad was...

18:20.309 --> 18:23.512
- You know what? I'm just gonna go.
- No. Come on, Cam.

18:23.604 --> 18:26.355
Uh, if Uncle Cam's leaving,
I'm just gonna go upstairs and study.

18:26.440 --> 18:28.895
Yeah, I have a party to go to, so...

18:28.984 --> 18:31.142
She punched me in the face!

18:31.236 --> 18:33.941
  He came out of nowhere, and
he scared the baby cheeses out of me.

18:34.031 --> 18:35.858
Hey, you're talking normal again.

18:35.949 --> 18:38.820
<i>Ay.</i> I love the
story about the old man.

18:38.911 --> 18:40.239
Nobody said "old."

18:40.329 --> 18:42.072
- Oh, Cam, can we please just go?
- Yes.

18:42.164 --> 18:43.824
Yeah, go. Please. I don't care.

18:43.916 --> 18:47.119
- Oh, Claire...
- No. No. I'm done!

18:47.211 --> 18:48.705
I'm done.

18:50.255 --> 18:52.047
I'm not done, <i>so</i> not done.

18:52.132 --> 18:53.591
Look, here's the thing.

18:53.675 --> 18:55.419
We-We have fireworks
at Christmas now...

18:55.511 --> 18:57.135
because that's what they do in Colombia.

18:57.221 --> 18:58.715
I don't mind.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.597
Thanksgiving...
That used to be me roasting a turkey...

19:00.682 --> 19:03.387
until the gays took it over
with whatever new turkey cooking craze...

19:03.477 --> 19:06.229
it is that you saw on the Food Network,
and I'm fine with that too.

19:06.313 --> 19:11.224
All I ask... all I ask...
is that you leave me Halloween. Yeah, Halloween.

19:11.318 --> 19:15.067
I realize it is a crazy-ass holiday for a
grown woman to care about this much...

19:15.155 --> 19:17.397
but it is <i>my</i> crazy-ass holiday.

19:18.492 --> 19:19.986
Mine.

19:27.042 --> 19:28.785
That's a lot of complaining
from somebody...

19:28.877 --> 19:31.712
who asked for thirds
of our tandoori turkey last year.

19:34.299 --> 19:35.414
- Claire...
- No!

19:35.509 --> 19:36.968
No, not ready to talk!

19:37.052 --> 19:39.210
- No.

19:39.304 --> 19:40.799
Listen.

19:41.974 --> 19:43.800
I know I haven't been much help today.

19:43.892 --> 19:47.724
That whole Jerry and Judy thing,
it really hit me hard.

19:47.813 --> 19:49.805
Is that why you've been
acting like such a nut all day?

19:49.898 --> 19:52.140
- You know, what if someday that's us?
- Honey...

19:52.234 --> 19:54.939
Look, you might not want
to hear this right now...

19:55.028 --> 19:56.653
after the meltdown I just had in there...

19:56.738 --> 20:00.190
but you're kinda stuck with me.

20:01.368 --> 20:03.574
- You promise?
- Oh.

20:05.914 --> 20:07.373
- I do.

20:11.712 --> 20:14.333
Trick or treat!

20:14.423 --> 20:16.830
We should just put out a bowl of candy
and have a cocktail, right?

20:16.925 --> 20:18.123
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:18.218 --> 20:20.460
Come in, if you dare.

20:20.554 --> 20:22.760
  Thank you for joining us
on our special night.

20:22.848 --> 20:25.137
 Other children haven't fared so well.
- Hey.

20:25.225 --> 20:26.803
 Help me! Help me!
- She's doing it.

20:26.894 --> 20:30.808
 Welcome to your nightmare, <i>muchachos!</i>
- No! No.

20:32.900 --> 20:35.735
  With all this fog,
it might be hard to see ahead.

20:35.819 --> 20:37.646
 Aaah!

20:37.738 --> 20:40.739
 Yeah!
- Yeah!

20:45.954 --> 20:47.448
- Wow.
- We're back in the game.

20:47.539 --> 20:49.164
- Let's go.
- I love it! I love it!

20:51.293 --> 20:52.918
- No, it wasn't.
- I did it for you.

20:55.964 --> 20:56.048
Oh, and one time she says,
"Don't choke...

20:56.048 --> 20:58.290
Oh, and one time she says,
"Don't choke...

20:58.383 --> 21:01.005
or I'll have to give you
the Hindenburg maneuver."

21:01.094 --> 21:03.004
Oh, one time she caught me staring off
and she goes...

21:03.096 --> 21:04.295
"Cam, what's wrong?

21:04.389 --> 21:05.884
You look like a deer in head lice."

21:07.059 --> 21:09.217
In the service, I had a job...

21:09.311 --> 21:11.932
briefly... handling explosives...

21:12.022 --> 21:14.347
which sounds dangerous, but it's not.

21:14.441 --> 21:15.900
You store them at the right temperature...

21:15.984 --> 21:17.479
you have no problems...

21:17.569 --> 21:19.194
If you tell her she
doesn't have a choice...

21:19.279 --> 21:22.066
she'll say,
"Don't you give me an old tomato."

21:22.157 --> 21:24.565
- Or when she's...
- Okay, enough!

21:24.660 --> 21:26.237
You try speaking in another language!

21:26.328 --> 21:28.155
Everybody out of my house!

21:28.247 --> 21:30.120
Until you do.

21:35.420 --> 21:36.452
