Long, long ago
deep in the forest

00:10.140 --> 00:14.039
there was a hidden village
where tiny creatures lived.

00:14.060 --> 00:18.219
They called themselves Smurfs.
They were good.

Then there was Gargamel,
the evil wizard.

He was bad.

Well, the forest
is still there.

And if you listen,
you may hear Gargamel's rage.

13:12.029 --> 13:16.049
Oh, well, Azrael.
At least we're on dry land.

13:16.070 --> 13:17.230
[lightning crackling]

13:19.200 --> 13:21.129
[meows]

13:28.049 --> 13:29.090
[meows]

13:29.110 --> 13:33.009
Wait for me, miserable cat.

13:33.029 --> 13:35.070
(Smurfette)
Oh, Papa Smurf, do you think

13:35.090 --> 13:37.080
we'll ever find Painter
and Poet?

13:37.100 --> 13:43.090
It's a big island, Smurfette.
We'll find them tomorrow.

13:43.110 --> 13:46.000
[snoring]

13:48.149 --> 13:50.210
[Gargamel yells]
Yeow!

13:50.230 --> 13:53.000
Ouch!

13:55.090 --> 13:56.210
[Azrael meowing]

13:58.139 --> 14:01.200
Catch it, Azrael, catch it.
That's our breakfast.

14:01.220 --> 14:05.159
Don't let him get away.
Gotcha.

14:05.179 --> 14:09.139
Ugh! Well,
there went our breakfast.

14:09.159 --> 14:11.220
[meowing]

14:12.000 --> 14:13.159
[snoring]

14:15.080 --> 14:16.230
[fly buzzing]

14:20.000 --> 14:21.110
Smurf.

14:25.190 --> 14:27.070
[grunts]

14:29.169 --> 14:32.059
[all yawning]

14:34.179 --> 14:36.100
Up, up, up, my little Smurfs.

14:36.120 --> 14:39.100
We have to find
Poet and Painter.

14:39.120 --> 14:45.009
[yawns]
I hate waking up.

14:48.169 --> 14:51.080
[monkeys chattering in distance]

14:55.070 --> 15:00.029
Look at this, Azrael.
A ridiculously tiny little boat.

15:00.049 --> 15:04.070
[laughs]
Wait. It's a Smurf boat.

15:04.090 --> 15:07.179
Azrael, there are Smurfs
on this island.

15:07.200 --> 15:09.059
[sniffs]

15:09.080 --> 15:11.000
[growls]

15:14.000 --> 15:17.009
Now they'll never escape.

15:17.029 --> 15:19.120
[laughs]

15:23.139 --> 15:29.110
[in unison]
Poet! Painter!
Poet! Painter!

15:29.129 --> 15:32.169
Oh, for some smurfcakes
and smurfberry jam

15:32.190 --> 15:36.029
the morning reminds me
of how hungry I am.

15:36.049 --> 15:37.159
Oh, it's no use, Painter.

15:37.179 --> 15:40.159
The only inspiration I have
is for food.

15:40.179 --> 15:44.139
Ah, me also.
All I can think of is the food.

15:44.159 --> 15:47.169
I almost miss the village
and the other Smurfs.

15:47.190 --> 15:49.039
[SPEAKING IN FRENCH]

15:49.059 --> 15:52.029
- But it's much better here.
- Oh! Oui! Oui!

15:52.049 --> 15:55.070
Just the same, I-I wonder
what they're doing right now.

15:55.090 --> 15:58.190
Ha, probably
working as usual. Ha, ha.

15:58.210 --> 16:00.049
Cleaning up..

16:00.070 --> 16:03.090
[sighs]
...the breakfast dishes.

16:03.110 --> 16:05.179
Yes, yes. And getting ready..

16:05.200 --> 16:08.029
[sighs]
...for lunch.

16:08.049 --> 16:10.179
[both moaning]

16:12.110 --> 16:15.009
[instrumental music]

16:23.080 --> 16:29.090
[stammering]
Ga-Ga-Ga-Gargamel!

16:29.110 --> 16:31.129
[Azrael snarling]

16:31.149 --> 16:34.039
[intense music]

16:36.129 --> 16:39.059
Quickly, smurf into
that crevasse.

16:44.220 --> 16:46.000
Shh.

16:46.019 --> 16:47.179
[sniffing]

16:49.000 --> 16:50.179
(Gargamel)
'Azrael!'

16:50.200 --> 16:53.169
Get back here.
We have Smurfs to find.

16:56.059 --> 16:57.120
Azrael!

16:58.070 --> 16:59.169
'Move your tail.'

17:00.220 --> 17:03.100
Ooh, you're such
a nincompuss, Azrael.

17:03.120 --> 17:06.079
I told you to hunt Smurfs,
not wander off.

17:06.098 --> 17:08.230
[meowing]

17:11.118 --> 17:14.220
Inspiration, where is thy sting?

17:15.000 --> 17:18.069
I've got it!
"Ode to a Fried Egg."

17:18.089 --> 17:19.220
Ugh! You cannot do that, Poet.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.180
I am creating the portrait
of the fried egg.

17:23.200 --> 17:27.079
"Fred egg?" Oh, anyway,
I thought of it first.

17:27.098 --> 17:29.029
Make yours poached.

17:29.049 --> 17:32.210
I refuse.
The poached egg make me sick.

17:32.230 --> 17:35.160
Well, your paintings
make me sick.

17:35.180 --> 17:39.049
- That is so?
- Yeah, that is so.

17:39.069 --> 17:44.089
- 'Then I give you the fat lip.'
- 'And I give you the fat head.'

17:44.109 --> 17:48.009
Well, my little Smurfs,
I think our search is over.

17:48.029 --> 17:53.109
- You are a, uh-uh, fruitcake!
- 'And you're a, uh-uh-uh--'

17:53.130 --> 17:57.140
Poet! Painter!
Stop this smurfing at once.

17:57.160 --> 17:59.009
(Poet and Painter)
Papa Smurf!

17:59.029 --> 18:00.180
[Azrael sniffs]

18:00.200 --> 18:02.230
Good work, Azrael.

18:03.009 --> 18:04.210
[Azrael meows]

18:05.000 --> 18:08.069
'Now all we have to do
is follow them.'

18:08.089 --> 18:10.039
[Azrael meows]

18:10.059 --> 18:12.109
But, Papa Smurf,
we can't leave.

18:12.130 --> 18:15.140
I haven't smurfed
my greatest poem yet.

18:15.160 --> 18:18.059
And I, my greatest masterpiece.

18:18.079 --> 18:19.220
[intense music]

18:20.000 --> 18:21.130
[whimpers]

18:21.150 --> 18:23.029
- Azrael!
- Azrael!

18:23.049 --> 18:24.170
And where there's Azrael,
there's--

18:24.190 --> 18:27.049
- Azrael!
- Gargamel!

18:27.069 --> 18:30.200
Catch them, Azrael,
or I'll turn you into a furball.

18:30.220 --> 18:33.079
[music continues]

18:33.099 --> 18:36.210
- Ah!
- I forgot my masterpieces.

18:36.230 --> 18:38.109
And my poems.

18:44.220 --> 18:45.220
[panting]

18:46.000 --> 18:48.150
Hey, someone smurfed our boat.

18:48.170 --> 18:52.049
- Gargamel.
- You called, Papa Smurf?

18:52.069 --> 18:56.089
Azrael, we're about to make
our catch of the day.

18:56.109 --> 18:58.150
[cackles]

18:58.170 --> 19:01.150
[snarls]

19:01.170 --> 19:03.059
[coughs]

19:03.079 --> 19:05.210
I'm not afraid of you,
Gargamel!

19:05.230 --> 19:07.210
Ow, my corns!

19:07.230 --> 19:10.009
[whimpering]

19:10.029 --> 19:13.009
You'll pay for this,
you miserable Smurfs.

19:16.130 --> 19:21.049
Soon, Azrael,
we'll be feasting on Smurfs.

19:21.069 --> 19:23.079
[meowing]

19:25.049 --> 19:26.160
[both gulps]

19:26.180 --> 19:28.089
We've gotta save them, Painter.

19:28.109 --> 19:30.059
Ah, oui, but how?

19:30.079 --> 19:33.049
I don't know. But we better
think of something fast.

19:33.069 --> 19:34.170
Come on.

19:36.130 --> 19:42.160
[cackles]
The end is near, you sniveling
Smurfs. It's supper time.

19:42.180 --> 19:45.220
Any last words before we eat?

19:46.000 --> 19:47.170
[cackles]

19:47.190 --> 19:51.170
Yes, Mr. Gargamel,
I have some last words.

19:51.190 --> 19:56.140
Another one? Well, uh-uh-uh,
say what you will, Smurf.

19:56.160 --> 19:59.069
And then I'll cook you too.

19:59.089 --> 20:00.190
[cackles]

20:00.210 --> 20:02.029
[gulps]

20:04.049 --> 20:05.170
[gasps]

20:07.039 --> 20:10.200
"Oh, pity poor Gargamel
the Great

20:10.220 --> 20:14.089
"he won't have any more
Smurfs to hate.

20:14.109 --> 20:16.220
'"He had to have them all
for dinner'

20:17.000 --> 20:20.009
'"But after today,
he's going to get thinner.'

20:20.029 --> 20:26.160
[sniffles]
"Sadly, this will be
Gargamel's very last treat

20:26.180 --> 20:31.150
for never again
will he have Smurfs to eat."

20:31.170 --> 20:34.099
[sobbing]
Oh, no. Oh, no.

20:34.119 --> 20:38.150
Oh, you're right.
Oh, it's true, it's true.

20:38.170 --> 20:41.059
[wailing]

20:43.130 --> 20:48.099
Oh, boo-hoo. Boo-hoo.
That was so good.

20:48.119 --> 20:50.099
[all crying]

20:53.079 --> 20:56.079
You-you can go, Poet Smurf.

20:56.099 --> 20:59.180
I must have one more Smurf
to kick around.

20:59.200 --> 21:07.039
[sobbing]
Otherwise, what kind of future
could I have without Smurf?

21:08.200 --> 21:11.180
That was a real
smurf of art, Poet.

21:11.200 --> 21:15.059
Ah, oui. It was
your greatest masterpiece.

21:15.079 --> 21:19.130
- Par excellence. Mwah.
- Oh, why, thank you, thank you.

21:19.150 --> 21:22.009
But we still have
one big problem, Papa Smurf.

21:22.029 --> 21:26.099
- How do we get off this island?
- Hmm, that is a problem.

21:26.119 --> 21:31.000
(Gargamel)
'Azrael, the Smurfs
have escaped. Find them!'

21:31.019 --> 21:33.049
- Smurfs, follow me.
- 'I hate Smurfs!'

21:33.069 --> 21:36.059
'Azrael, after them.
They're getting away.'

21:36.079 --> 21:38.009
[Azrael meowing]

21:41.130 --> 21:44.049
That log. Smurf it into
the water, quickly.

21:45.140 --> 21:47.180
This way, Azrael.

21:47.200 --> 21:50.029
There they are. There they are,
Azrael, get them!

21:50.049 --> 21:52.069
[intense music]

21:52.089 --> 21:56.140
- Gargamel, over here!
- Oh, it's you!

21:56.160 --> 21:58.210
G-g-get him, Azrael.
Get them both!

21:58.230 --> 22:00.039
[Azrael meows]

22:00.059 --> 22:02.170
Quickly, quickly.

22:02.190 --> 22:05.089
[music continues]

22:07.180 --> 22:09.140
They went into that cave,
Azrael.

22:09.160 --> 22:11.119
[Gargamel and Azrael moan]

22:11.140 --> 22:15.220
Painter, this mural is
your greatest masterpiece ever.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.130
Ah, merci, Poet, merci.

'Papa Smurf, wait.'

22:20.150 --> 22:24.170
(Gargamel)
'I can't take this anymore.
I hate those Smurfs!'

22:24.190 --> 22:27.079
'Smurfs, I'll get you!'

22:27.099 --> 22:30.150
To the boat, Azrael.
They won't get far.

22:30.170 --> 22:32.180
[intense music]

22:34.140 --> 22:38.039
(Smurfette)
Papa Smurf,
they're gaining on us.

22:38.059 --> 22:39.220
Don't worry, Smurfette.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.140
(Gargamel)
'Help! Help, we're sinking!'

22:42.160 --> 22:45.049
Help! Oh, get off, you fool.

[yells]
Yeow! Help!

22:47.099 --> 22:49.150
[Azrael meows]

22:49.170 --> 22:56.000
Smurfs! I'll get you, if
it's the last thing I ever do!

22:56.019 --> 23:00.160
How did you do that, Papa Smurf?
More of your amazing magic?

23:00.180 --> 23:05.049
No magic, Brainy. I simply
smurfed their drain plug.

23:05.069 --> 23:09.029
Ah, "Ode to a Drain Plug."

23:14.230 --> 23:17.029
[theme music]
