HMM?

07:46.033 --> 07:47.134
YEAH, HE'S HERE.

07:47.167 --> 07:50.170
[laughing]

07:50.203 --> 07:52.706
- WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?
- WHAT WAS WHAT ABOUT?

07:52.740 --> 07:54.975
- WITH JOSH.
YOU LOOKED AT ME AND LAUGHED.

07:55.008 --> 07:56.977
- WHAT? THAT'S CRAZY, BRO.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.145
[gasps]

07:58.178 --> 07:59.947
ARE YOU JEALOUS OF JOSH?

07:59.980 --> 08:00.848
- OH, YOU MEAN "JOSH-WA"?

08:00.881 --> 08:03.150
- GUYS, I'M REAL--

08:03.183 --> 08:05.886
- YOU'RE JEALOUS.
THAT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF SWEET.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.621
- I DON'T GET JEALOUS.
- GOOD, 'CAUSE I DIDN'T

08:07.655 --> 08:09.189
GET JEALOUS WHEN YOU STARTED
GETTING FREE WIFI

08:09.222 --> 08:10.724
FROM THAT CABLE GUY
WHO FELL OFF THE ROOF.

08:10.758 --> 08:12.159
ALAN?-
- YEAH, YEAH, ALAN.

08:12.192 --> 08:13.894
- ALAN WAS DIFFERENT.
ALAN WAS BLOWING ME.

08:13.927 --> 08:16.229
NOW, UNLESS JOSH IS BLOWING YOU,
I TOTALLY GET IT.

08:16.263 --> 08:18.131
- HE'S NOT BLOWING ME.
- DO YOU?

08:18.165 --> 08:19.667
- HE'S NOT BLOWING ME.
- OKAY, SURE.

08:19.700 --> 08:22.570
- HEY, SOPHIE,
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

08:22.603 --> 08:23.804
I THOUGHT THEY RELEASED YOU
DAYS AGO.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.072
- CAN WE HELP YOU?

08:25.105 --> 08:27.040
- HI, I'M BRIAN,
THE PARAMEDIC

08:27.074 --> 08:28.241
WHO BROUGHT SOPHIE
TO THE HOSPITAL.

08:28.275 --> 08:29.743
IS SHE OKAY?

08:29.777 --> 08:31.244
- WELL, HER PROM DATE
CANCELLED ON HER.

08:31.278 --> 08:33.046
- WHAT?
WHAT A JERK!

08:33.080 --> 08:35.348
- HE SAID IT'S BECAUSE
HE COULDN'T AFFORD IT,

08:35.382 --> 08:37.484
BUT SHE THINKS IT'S BECAUSE
OF THE BRUISES.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.753
SHE WANTED TO SEE
IF THE DOCTORS COULD DO ANYTHING

08:39.787 --> 08:41.655
TO SPEED UP
THE HEALING PROCESS.

08:41.689 --> 08:45.092
- UNFORTUNATELY,
IT'S JUST GONNA TAKE TIME.

08:45.125 --> 08:46.727
HEY, SOPHIE.

08:46.760 --> 08:50.731
- I LOOKED UP JENNIFER GARNER'S
PROM PICTURE.

08:50.764 --> 08:52.199
YEAH, YOU LIED.

08:52.232 --> 08:54.034
SHE LOOKED AMAZING.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.235
- I DID LIE ABOUT THAT.

08:55.268 --> 08:57.170
YOU DESERVE THE TRUTH.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.539
THAT GUY WHO CANCELLED ON YOU,
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

08:59.573 --> 09:01.274
- JEREMY TRAVERS.

09:01.308 --> 09:04.678
- WELL, JEREMY TRAVERS
IS ONE DUMB MOTHER,

09:04.712 --> 09:06.446
YOU CAN GUESS THE REST.
AM I RIGHT, SOPHIE'S DAD?

09:06.479 --> 09:08.081
- NEVER TRUSTED HIM.
- YEAH.

09:08.115 --> 09:10.050
ANY GUY WOULD BE LUCKY
TO GO TO THE PROM WITH YOU.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.952
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY THAT.
- I'M SURE THERE'S

09:11.985 --> 09:13.721
THOUSANDS OF GUYS
WAITING TO TAKE HIS PLACE.

09:13.754 --> 09:16.456
- EVERYBODY WHO WANTS TO GO
ALREADY HAS A DATE.

09:16.489 --> 09:18.425
SO...

09:18.458 --> 09:20.093
- WHAT IF I TOOK YOU?

09:20.127 --> 09:21.461
- YOU'D DO THAT FOR ME?

09:21.494 --> 09:24.231
- WITH YOUR PARENTS' BLESSING,
I WOULD.

09:24.264 --> 09:25.599
- WELL...[stammers]
- THAT'S--

09:25.633 --> 09:27.067
- WHAT A GENTLEMAN.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.201
- THAT'S REALLY NICE OF YOU,
BRIAN.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.603
- AWESOME!

09:29.637 --> 09:31.238
WELL, I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION
FOR YOU.

09:31.271 --> 09:32.305
CUMMERBUND OR VEST?

09:32.339 --> 09:34.374
- YOUR CHOICE.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.309
- OH! OKAY, CURVEBALL.

09:36.343 --> 09:38.411
ALL RIGHT, ONE MORE QUESTION.

09:38.445 --> 09:40.748
DO YOU WANT TO BE SURPRISED
OR DO YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU

09:40.781 --> 09:42.149
WHAT I'M GOING WITH RIGHT NOW?

09:42.182 --> 09:43.450
- WHATEVER.

09:43.483 --> 09:46.419
- OKAY, SURPRISE IT IS.

09:46.453 --> 09:48.121
CUMMERBUND.
IT'S CUMMERBUND.

09:48.155 --> 09:51.158
I'M SORRY, I GOT TOO EXCITED.
I SPILLED THE BEANS.

09:51.191 --> 09:52.292
IT'S ALWAYS GONNA BE CUMMERBUND,
ISN'T IT?

09:52.325 --> 09:53.293
OKAY.

09:55.663 --> 09:57.164

10:02.703 --> 10:03.837
- EXCUSE ME?

10:05.639 --> 10:06.840

JOHNNY?

10:08.676 --> 10:11.011

JOSH CONVINCED ME TO TRY IT.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.012
- OH, JOSH.

10:12.045 --> 10:13.513
- JOSH ASKED YOU

10:13.546 --> 10:14.982
- YEAH.

10:15.015 --> 10:16.583
HE'S BEEN HOOKING ME UP
WITH ALL THIS STUFF.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.285
I TOLD HIM I WANTED TO DO
SOMETHING COOL FOR HIM.

10:18.318 --> 10:20.587
HE WAS LIKE, "MAKE ME DINNER
SOME NIGHT,"

10:20.620 --> 10:22.589
AND I WAS LIKE, "ALL RIGHT."
[chuckles]

10:22.622 --> 10:24.091
WHAT WAS I GONNA DO,
SAY NO?

10:24.124 --> 10:25.592
- HELL, YEAH, YOU SAY NO!

10:25.625 --> 10:27.594
- I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.629

11:37.430 --> 11:40.067

12:07.660 --> 12:09.797
I HAD TO STIR THE ROUX
FOR LIKE AN HOUR.

12:09.830 --> 12:10.931
- AH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, BRO.

12:10.964 --> 12:12.399
I CAN'T HAVE ANY KANGAROO.

12:12.432 --> 12:15.068
NOT AFTER EVERYTHING

OH! YOU DID IT ANYWAY,
AFTER I ASKED YOU NICELY NOT TO.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.087

12:34.121 --> 12:35.755
- WOW, JOHNNY.

YOU'VE GOT FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE
SYNDROME, DUDE.

12:51.371 --> 12:52.739

OKAY, I LOOK TERRIBLE.

[whispers]
GRAPES.

14:26.033 --> 14:28.902

14:47.254 --> 14:49.722
- WHY'D YOU SAY IT LIKE THAT?
[laughs]

14:49.756 --> 14:51.458
- LIKE WHAT?

14:51.491 --> 14:53.126
IT'S GOOD.

14:54.594 --> 14:55.795
- BE HONEST, BRO.
I CAN TAKE IT.

14:55.828 --> 14:57.230
[weak chuckle]

14:58.665 --> 15:00.067

15:07.240 --> 15:09.242
JOHNNY.
- THE SHRIMP IS FINE, MOUSSE.

15:09.276 --> 15:10.777
- FINE? DID JOSH DRIVE
ALL THE WAY FROM ANDERSONVILLE

15:10.810 --> 15:12.212
FOR "FINE"?
I DON'T THINK SO.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.713
I CAN TOTALLY MAKE SOME MORE--
YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:13.746 --> 15:15.315
I'M GONNA MAKE SOME MORE

AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I ACTUALLY HAVE TO GET GOING.

15:21.154 --> 15:23.423
I'VE GOT ANOTHER THING.

15:23.456 --> 15:26.926
- OH...I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU HAD SOMETHING ELSE TONIGHT.

15:29.296 --> 15:35.235

THIS WAS JUST A CASUAL THING.

15:35.268 --> 15:39.272

16:03.530 --> 16:05.665
HE'S THE PARAMEDIC
THAT SAVED ME.

16:05.698 --> 16:07.334

16:07.367 --> 16:09.036
MAJOR UPGRADE.

SORRY FOR YOU, IN A BAD WAY,

WE GET OUT THERE

16:21.581 --> 16:24.451
AND MIX IT UP A LITTLE BIT?
- NO, I'M HONESTLY FINE.

16:24.484 --> 16:25.652
- FINE?

16:25.685 --> 16:27.520
THERE IS NO WAY,

16:41.434 --> 16:42.635
THAT'S A GOOD SONG.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.371
I CAME HERE THINKING
ABOUT THAT SONG.

16:44.404 --> 16:45.872
I HEARD THAT SONG IN MY HEAD

NOT TO SAY NOTHING.

17:34.821 --> 17:36.523
- WE WERE TRYING
TO GIVE HIM A HEAD START.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.291

GONNA CHASE AFTER HIM?

17:38.325 --> 17:40.227
