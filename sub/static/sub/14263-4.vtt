I could take on that thing
if I could mutate.

13:15.026 --> 13:17.194
Come on, Carter.
You can do it.

13:17.262 --> 13:20.064
Mutate! Mutate!

13:21.766 --> 13:25.803
Man, I have got to work
on my timing.
[ Snarling, Screeching ]

13:32.678 --> 13:35.813
When it is ready,
we will start loading
the X-fire fuel.

13:35.881 --> 13:39.250
I think this is the power supply
for that laser cannon.

13:39.318 --> 13:43.754
You mean, that little
box of fuel could run a laser
big enough to destroy a city?

13:43.822 --> 13:47.458
That X-fire is so powerful
they'll only need a few pellets.

13:47.526 --> 13:51.595
So what would happen
if we loaded all the fuel
into the generator?

13:51.663 --> 13:55.132
Well, the generator
would overload.
The fuel would blow.

13:55.200 --> 13:58.669
And you said that stuff
has enough kick
to orbit a building.

13:59.905 --> 14:03.641
Come on. Let's find where
they're keeping that fuel.

14:06.078 --> 14:09.346
[ Panting ]
We got away from it,
dude.

14:09.414 --> 14:12.350
You have a rich fantasy life,
Michelangelo.

14:14.585 --> 14:17.755
[ Crackling ]
There's
the X-fire fuel.

14:19.624 --> 14:22.559
Be careful.
The slightest bump
could set it off.

14:22.627 --> 14:25.095
Yeah. There's no way
we could do this...

14:25.163 --> 14:27.531
if we mutated again.

14:27.599 --> 14:29.833
Put it down.
Put it down!

14:32.103 --> 14:35.039
Aw, great.
<i>Now</i> what do we do?

14:35.073 --> 14:39.243
We can't give up.
We'll just have to be
extra careful.

14:42.847 --> 14:47.451
Dude, I think we're
about to become the Teenage
Mutant <i> Crispy</i> Turtles!

14:48.486 --> 14:49.954
Or maybe not!

14:51.523 --> 14:55.392
All right!
Let's annihilate that
stinkin' sack of bolts!

14:58.996 --> 15:01.532
So much for Dregg's
ultimate weapon.

15:04.136 --> 15:06.269
Whuh-oh.

15:07.405 --> 15:08.772
Big deal.

15:08.840 --> 15:12.109
We can trash two
just as easily as one.

15:17.148 --> 15:19.583
Okay, how about four?

15:28.060 --> 15:29.860
[ Both Yelling ]

15:31.029 --> 15:34.999
Dude, this is not gonna be
as easy as we thought!

15:37.001 --> 15:39.169
[ Snarling ]

15:41.339 --> 15:44.375
Guys, come in.
We got big trouble.

15:45.176 --> 15:47.110
Terrific.
No Turtles.

15:47.178 --> 15:48.612
Now what?
[ Beeping ]

15:48.647 --> 15:51.182
The wrist ray!

15:51.249 --> 15:53.350
We designed this to stun
the Techno-Gangsters.

15:53.417 --> 15:57.254
- [ Beeping ]
- But maybe it'll slow down
that overblown gecko.

15:57.322 --> 15:59.756
[ Tires Screeching ]

16:05.930 --> 16:07.464
All right!
It's working!

16:11.336 --> 16:16.807
Oh, no. At the rate he's going,
he'll devour the whole city
in no time.

16:18.810 --> 16:22.846
- [ Hissing ]
- Man! It just keeps
getting bigger!

16:28.286 --> 16:29.887
[ Roaring ]

16:29.954 --> 16:32.756
Suddenly I feel like
a midnight snack!

16:35.293 --> 16:38.261
My mom didn't raise me
to be a hot lunch!

16:41.366 --> 16:43.434
[ Roaring ]

16:54.078 --> 16:56.913
[ Grunting, Shrieking ]

16:59.384 --> 17:01.552
[ Roaring ]

17:04.455 --> 17:06.457
[ Groans ]
Oh, man!

17:07.090 --> 17:09.393
What hit me?

17:13.230 --> 17:15.898
Time to call in the cavalry.

17:15.967 --> 17:18.367
[ Tires Screeching ]

17:18.369 --> 17:21.872
[ Grunting ]
I wonder if Carter's having
a better night than we are.

17:21.939 --> 17:26.209
Every time we trash
one of these things,
two more appear!

17:26.277 --> 17:28.412
Yeah.
They're worse than rabbits.

17:28.479 --> 17:30.080
[ Gasping ]
Don't you see?

17:30.147 --> 17:32.182
We can't fight 'em
like this.

17:32.250 --> 17:35.119
[ Both Grunting ]

17:36.854 --> 17:40.157
We can't fight 'em
like this either.
Run for it!

17:41.559 --> 17:43.794
What are we waiting for?

17:43.862 --> 17:46.663
If we drop these pellets,
they'll explode.

17:46.731 --> 17:49.967
And these mutated hands
are too big and clumsy.

17:50.034 --> 17:53.603
We got to get... back...
to... normal.

17:54.339 --> 17:56.072
Whew!
Whoa!

17:56.140 --> 17:58.809
- Finally!
- Come on. Let's get to work.

18:03.148 --> 18:06.249
[ Laughing ]
The Turtles are finished.

18:06.317 --> 18:10.721
The power supply for the laser
cannon should be operational
in half an hour, Lord Dregg.

18:10.788 --> 18:15.459
Then I can blast
the human race
into submission.

18:15.526 --> 18:17.361
[ Motorcycle Revs ]

18:22.032 --> 18:25.469
Whoa! Looks like the guys
have been having
a serious party.

18:27.906 --> 18:30.207
At least we can use
our weapons again.

18:30.275 --> 18:34.244
Wait. Remember how
Leonardo and Donatello
fell through the floor?

18:34.312 --> 18:37.280
Why, yes. It's one
of my fondest memories.

18:37.348 --> 18:40.484
Follow me, dude,
and get ready to swing for it!

18:40.552 --> 18:44.188
Come on, you metal maniacs!
Here we are!

18:44.255 --> 18:47.324

finally gone out of your mind.

Watch this!

get out of here?
Stand back, guys!

Come on!
We've gotta go!
Are you kiddin'?

19:12.316 --> 19:16.453
We've made it through
all of Dregg's defenses.
Now we can finish that maniac.

19:16.521 --> 19:19.923
Splinter said brute force
wasn't the answer.

19:19.991 --> 19:23.593
Yeah, dude.
It sure didn't work
against those repli-creeps.

19:23.661 --> 19:27.531

gonna run away just when
we've got Dregg cornered.

- Uh, guys?
- Carter!

19:29.600 --> 19:33.002
- What are you doing here?
- Well, I couldn't raise you
on the Turtle-com.

19:33.070 --> 19:35.472
This place is probably
jamming the frequency.

19:35.539 --> 19:37.474
And while you've been
fooling around here,

19:37.542 --> 19:40.210
a monster
the size of a Mack truck
has been tearing up the city.

19:40.277 --> 19:41.578
What?
What?
What?

19:41.646 --> 19:43.146
Why didn't you
say so?

So--
[ Chuckles ]

19:46.851 --> 19:49.286

too much for them.

19:49.353 --> 19:53.723
No matter. In 20 minutes,
my laser cannon will be on line.

19:53.791 --> 19:57.861
And then it will be too late
for the entire world!

19:57.928 --> 20:00.531
There's only one place
this monster
could have come from--

20:00.598 --> 20:02.332
Dregg's genetics lab.

20:02.400 --> 20:04.668
From the egg that fell out
of the incubator.

20:04.735 --> 20:09.239
Uh-huh. And you say
every time the thing eats
something metal it grows?

20:09.307 --> 20:11.008
Yeah, that's right.

20:11.075 --> 20:14.278
Maybe there's a connection
to the fact that the incubator
was made of zantronium.

20:14.346 --> 20:16.046
Well, yeah, b-but what--

20:16.113 --> 20:19.483
A-And why did the egg hatch
<i>after</i> it was out
of the incubator?

20:19.551 --> 20:21.985
Maybe it wasn't
an incubator at all, dude.

20:22.053 --> 20:24.421
Michelangelo,
that's brilliant!

20:24.489 --> 20:27.391
Zantronium
blocks energy waves.

20:27.459 --> 20:30.427
The vat actually <i> prevented</i>
the egg from hatching.

20:30.495 --> 20:32.696
Zantronium inhibits
the monster's growth.

20:32.764 --> 20:36.232
Yeah, so we've got to find
a whole lot of it. Fast!

20:36.300 --> 20:39.236
No sweat.
You know the Goulding Tower?
Yeah!

20:39.303 --> 20:42.272
Oh, I read somewhere
that Goulding
was a rare metals freak.

20:42.340 --> 20:45.175
And he made
the top of the building
out of pure zantronium.

20:45.209 --> 20:48.445

Now all we've got to do
is get that monster up there.

20:48.513 --> 20:50.580

got its attention.

really gonna work?

In theory, yes.

with a lot of confidence,

the finishing touch--

"Dregg was here."
That oughta give the world
a message!

still has his fortress
and that laser cannon.

- Not for long he doesn't.
- What do you mean, dude?

22:01.686 --> 22:06.156

all of that superfuel into
the laser's power supply.

When he tries to use
that cannon,

he's gonna get
a big surprise!

is on line, Lord Dregg.

are no match for--

of the story already.
