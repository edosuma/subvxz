NOW, CLASS, I KNOW YOU'RE ALL
LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR HOLIDAY,

SO I'M NOT GOING TO ASSIGN
ANY HOMEWORK.

[STUDENTS CHEERING]

01:31.342 --> 01:33.678
BUT YOUR LEAF COLLECTIONS
ARE GOING TO BE DUE

01:33.845 --> 01:35.054
THE DAY YOU GET BACK.

01:35.221 --> 01:38.224
I ALREADY
HAVE EVERY LEAF
IN WALNUT GROVE

01:38.391 --> 01:39.726
IN MY BAG.

01:39.893 --> 01:41.186
THAT'S VERY GOOD, WILLIE,

01:41.352 --> 01:43.062
BUT I'M SURE
SOME OF THE OTHER STUDENTS

01:43.229 --> 01:44.814
CAN USE THE TIME TO COMPLETE
THEIR COLLECTIONS.

01:44.981 --> 01:48.067
MISS BEADLE,
OUR PA IS TAKING US
ON A CAMP-OUT.

01:48.234 --> 01:51.070

ALL KINDS OF LEAVES
UP IN THE HILLS.

01:51.237 --> 01:52.614
Miss Beadle:
THAT'S WONDERFUL, LAURA.

01:52.781 --> 01:54.073
I'M SURE
YOU CAN BRING BACK

01:54.240 --> 01:55.575
SOME UNUSUAL SPECIMENS
TO SHOW THE CLASS.

01:55.742 --> 01:56.951

01:57.118 --> 01:59.496
SHE'S GOING SOMEWHERE SPECIAL
TO HUNT FOR LEAVES.

01:59.662 --> 02:02.081
SHE'LL GET BETTER LEAVES
THAN ANYONE ELSE.

02:02.248 --> 02:03.500
YEAH'.
THAT'S CHEATING.

02:03.666 --> 02:05.001
WILLIE, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

COULD FIND THEM ALL.

BE GRADED?

02:12.967 --> 02:14.427
YES, MARY, YOU WILL,

02:14.594 --> 02:16.930
AND THE BEST COLLECTION
WILL BE PLACED IN A BOOK,

02:17.096 --> 02:19.307
AND IT WILL BE PUT RIGHT HERE
ON MY DESK FOR DISPLAY.

02:19.474 --> 02:21.476

DON'T THINK

02:55.093 --> 02:58.555
THAT HE'S GOING TO SPEND
ALL OF HIS TIME FISHING,
DO YOU?

02:58.721 --> 03:00.306
I HAPPEN TO KNOW
THAT HE SETS
A GREAT STORE

03:00.473 --> 03:04.185

SO HE'S GOING TO
HELP THEM ALL HE CAN.

03:04.352 --> 03:06.521

I EXPECT YOU TO FIND OUT
WHERE THEY'RE GOING.

03:12.527 --> 03:16.656
THEN YOU TAKE YOUR SON
AND YOUR DAUGHTER
TO THE EXACT SAME SPOT.

NO MORE EXCUSES.

GOOD TIME TO PUT
A LINE IN THE WATER.

SPLIT BAMBOO ROD IN,

I MIGHT TAKE OFF
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS

HERE, LET ME SEE THAT.

05:34.043 --> 05:35.795
I'VE NEVER FISHED
WITH ONE OF THESE.

05:35.962 --> 05:38.506
WELL, YOU LET ME KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE FISHING,

05:38.673 --> 05:40.883

YOU COULD TRY ONE OUT.

WHY DON'T YOU
COME ALONG WITH US?

BE INTRUDING?

AROUND, TOO.

OF THIS STUFF

TO CAMP OUT.

IN THE WILDERNESS
ONCE IN A WHILE.

09:08.341 --> 09:09.508
YES, IT DOES.

09:09.675 --> 09:12.553

TAKE US AS CHILDREN.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.013
IT WAS GRAND.

SOME COCOA.

MAMA USED TO PUT ME
IN CHARGE OF HER SAMOVAR,

09:20.811 --> 09:22.605
AND I WOULD LOAD IT
INTO THE SURREY,

09:22.772 --> 09:24.357

THAT IT WASN'T SCRATCHED

09:24.523 --> 09:25.900

09:26.067 --> 09:27.193

09:27.360 --> 09:28.778

FOR THE COCOA, ISN'T IT?

09:28.945 --> 09:29.987
YES.

09:30.154 --> 09:33.824
OH, AND THEN WE WOULD GO OFF
TO OUR FAVORITE HILLTOP,

09:33.991 --> 09:35.826
AND IT WAS
A MARVELOUS VANTAGE POINT

09:35.993 --> 09:38.037
FOR WATCHING THE BOATING
ON THE RIVER.

09:38.204 --> 09:40.831
OH, WELL,
I ENVY YOU.

09:40.998 --> 09:43.793
I REALLY WISH
I WAS GOING ALONG.

09:43.960 --> 09:45.711
WELL, I THINK
THIS CAMP-OUT

09:45.878 --> 09:47.922
IS GOING TO BE
A BIT ROUGHER
THAN THAT.

09:48.089 --> 09:50.716
OH, PERHAPS, BUT STILL,

09:50.883 --> 09:53.761

THE SMELL OF FRESH COFFEE

09:53.928 --> 09:56.389

THINGS AREN'T ALWAYS

09:58.599 --> 10:00.434
QUITE THE WAY
WE REMEMBER THEM.

10:00.601 --> 10:02.770

TO FORGET

10:02.937 --> 10:05.022

LIKE MOSQUITOES

10:05.189 --> 10:06.399
AND SNAKES.

10:06.565 --> 10:10.194
OH, WELL, I SUPPOSE SO,
BUT STILL I WOULD ENJOY

10:10.361 --> 10:14.073
WATCHING THE CHILDREN
ENJOYING THEMSELVES AS I DID.

OH, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT THE CHILDREN.

10:16.367 --> 10:18.369
I'LL LOOK AFTER THEM
AS THOUGH THEY WERE MY OWN.

YES, INDEED,
AND THERE IS THE STORE.

10:21.414 --> 10:28.546
YES, I MUST...STAY HERE
AND TAKE CARE OF THE STORE.

10:28.713 --> 10:30.256

10:30.423 --> 10:32.174

ARRANGEMENTS SOONER.

10:32.341 --> 10:35.761

NO. NO.

25:49.758 --> 25:53.637
YOU KNOW, I NEVER REALIZED
WHAT A FINE OUTDOOR
PERSON YOU ARE.

25:53.803 --> 25:59.059
OH, YES. YES. WELL,
THERE WAS A TIME

25:59.226 --> 26:02.520
WHEN I GAVE LESSONS
TO MY BROTHER.

26:02.687 --> 26:04.022

Harriet: YES,
THERE WAS A TIME

26:11.404 --> 26:13.782
WHEN THE OUTDOORS
WAS MY LIFE.

26:13.949 --> 26:16.701
OH, I USED TO BE
VERY ATHLETIC.

26:16.868 --> 26:19.829
I GUESS YOU CAN TELL THAT
BY NELLIE AND WILLIE.

26:19.996 --> 26:23.208
WELL, YOU KNOW,
THEY GET IT FROM ME.

26:23.375 --> 26:25.794
OH, WELL,
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER,

26:25.961 --> 26:28.004
THERE WASN'T
ANYTHING--AAH'.

26:33.885 --> 26:39.557
AH, WELL, MAYBE I COULD
USE JUST A LITTLE HELP.

26:43.937 --> 26:45.480
THAT IS SOME BIG FISH
YOU CAUGHT, NELS.

26:45.647 --> 26:46.898
WAIT TILL EDWARDS
HEARS ABOUT IT.

26:47.065 --> 26:48.733
OH, HE'LL HAVE CAUGHT
A BIGGER ONE,

26:48.900 --> 26:50.944
BUT NOT WITH
A WITNESS AROUND.

HOW'D YOU DO?

27:00.245 --> 27:01.454
Charles:
HOW DID WE DO?

27:01.621 --> 27:04.249
YOU ASK THE 2 BEST
FISHERMEN IN HERO TOWNSHIP
THAT QUESTION?

27:04.416 --> 27:05.709
Nels: LOOK AT THAT.

27:05.875 --> 27:08.169
HOW DO YOU LIKE THOSE,
HUH, WILLIE, NELLIE?

27:08.336 --> 27:09.087

AT PA'S FISH.

27:10.880 --> 27:11.923

THINK OF THAT?

27:12.090 --> 27:13.258

IT'S BEAUTIFUL'.

27:13.425 --> 27:14.342
Laura: HE GOT A LOT.

27:14.509 --> 27:18.471
WELL, HARRIET,
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

27:18.638 --> 27:21.641
THAT'S AS GOOD
A JOB AS I HAVE
EVER SEEN.

27:21.808 --> 27:23.810
I NEVER THOUGHT
YOU COULD DO THAT
ALL BY YOURSELF.

27:23.977 --> 27:25.103
OH, WELL, I...

27:25.270 --> 27:28.064
I WAS AMAZED THAT MRS. OLESON
IS SUCH A FINE CAMPER.

27:28.231 --> 27:30.191
WHY, SHE EVEN HELPED ME
WITH MY WORK.

27:30.358 --> 27:32.610
OH, WELL,
NO, I CAN'T TAKE
ALL OF THE CREDIT,

27:32.777 --> 27:34.029
BUT IF I DO
SAY SO MYSELF...

27:34.195 --> 27:36.072
THESE ARE BEAUTIFUL.
THEY'RE GOING TO
COOK UP VERY NICELY.

27:36.239 --> 27:37.699
TAKE A LOOK
AT THE ONE
NELS CAUGHT.

27:37.866 --> 27:40.118
I THOUGHT
HE HAD HOOKED
INTO A WHALE.

27:40.285 --> 27:41.578
I CAN'T TAKE CREDIT.

27:41.745 --> 27:43.455
IT JUST HAPPENED
TO HIT MY LINE FIRST.

27:43.621 --> 27:47.250
HA HA HA'. WELL, TO PRESERVE
THE HONOR OF THE INGALLS FAMILY,

27:47.417 --> 27:49.044
I'LL JUST HAVE TO
COOK THEM UP.

27:49.210 --> 27:51.004
OH, NO, THAT WON'T
BE NECESSARY, DEAR.

27:51.171 --> 27:52.881
I DON'T MIND.
I HAVE TO COOK
OURS ANYWAY.

DONE SO MUCH FOR ME,

27:54.632 --> 27:55.800

ENOUGH TO DO

27:55.967 --> 27:57.302
FOR YOURSELF
AND YOUR FAMILY.
I'LL COOK THEM.

CAN HANDLE IT VERY
NICELY, THANK YOU.

28:02.307 --> 28:03.892

28:05.935 --> 28:07.562
THANK YOU
VERY MUCH, NELS.

28:07.729 --> 28:09.481

SWEET OF YOU.

28:09.647 --> 28:11.524

I HAVE A FIRE
ALREADY STARTED.

28:11.691 --> 28:13.485

OUT OF THE WAY,

28:13.651 --> 28:15.987

SIT DOWN HERE,
PUT YOUR FEET UP,

28:16.154 --> 28:18.490

TO COOK YOU
A MESS OF FISH

FINISH UP NOW, GIRLS.

A BIG DAY.

SHARE WITH ME,

30:05.221 --> 30:06.556
IF I FIND
A SPECIAL ONE,

30:06.723 --> 30:08.057
I WON'T SHARE IT
WITH YOU.

IF YOU AREN'T GOING TO
SHARE WITH NELLIE,

30:13.605 --> 30:15.607
THEN DON'T EXPECT NELLIE
TO SHARE WITH YOU.

30:15.773 --> 30:17.108
I WON'T.

30:20.320 --> 30:21.905
LOOK.

30:23.281 --> 30:25.074
WHAT IS IT?

30:25.241 --> 30:27.619
IT'S THE POISON IVY.

30:27.785 --> 30:29.913
WHAT'LL WE DO?

30:31.206 --> 30:35.168

GO TO BED...NOW.

WE BETTER TELL PA.

30:41.799 --> 30:43.009
IT'S TOO LATE.

30:43.176 --> 30:45.428
BESIDES, IT WAS
WILLIE'S OWN FAULT.

30:45.595 --> 30:49.057
WELL, WE COULD PRETEND
THAT THE FIRST TIME
WE SAW THE POISON IVY

30:49.224 --> 30:52.143
WAS WHEN MRS. OLESON
PICKED IT UP.

30:52.310 --> 30:53.561
THAT WOULD BE LYING.

30:53.728 --> 30:55.480
IF WE JUST DON'T
SAY ANYTHING,

30:55.647 --> 30:56.689
AT LEAST
WE WON'T BE LYING.

30:56.856 --> 30:58.441
YOU'RE RIGHT.

30:58.608 --> 31:00.485
ANYWAY, MAYBE SHE DIDN'T
TOUCH IT ENOUGH.

31:00.652 --> 31:03.363

BREAK OUT.

NOW, YOUR MOTHER'S
RIGHT.

SPREADS POISON IVY.

AGREE MORE.

THAT WILLIE AND I

32:19.105 --> 32:21.941

WHO CONTRACTED
THIS POISON IVY?

UM...WELL, WE HOPE
YOU GET BETTER SOON.

32:26.738 --> 32:29.032

OUR CHORES.

ROLL UP OUR BEDS

THERE ISN'T SOMETHING
I CAN DO FOR YOU?

I COULD TAKE IT AS WELL.

THAT ONE SHOULD IMPOSE

32:56.392 --> 32:57.769

ON OTHERS.
