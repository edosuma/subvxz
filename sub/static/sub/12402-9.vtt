[indistinct conversations]

00:09.636 --> 00:11.137
I think I want to be funny.

00:11.221 --> 00:12.222
[Dagmar laughs]

00:12.305 --> 00:14.182
That's a good one. [chuckles]

00:14.265 --> 00:15.975
-[cell phone chimes]
-[sighs]

00:16.059 --> 00:17.310
Oh, guys...

00:17.393 --> 00:19.270
Was it that Vaginismus guy again?

00:19.354 --> 00:20.355
Yeah, it's like...

00:20.438 --> 00:22.148
He wants to go for dinner.

00:22.232 --> 00:24.067
Well, what's wrong with that?

00:24.150 --> 00:26.152
You used to get excited
when a guy would call you

00:26.236 --> 00:27.403
after riding the rails.

00:27.487 --> 00:30.156
Oh, yeah, like an old dirty hobo.

00:30.240 --> 00:31.658
He's not my type of guy.

00:31.741 --> 00:33.034
You know, he's like,

00:33.117 --> 00:35.119
"You're great. I'd love to see you again."

00:35.203 --> 00:37.789
I was like, "Oh, okay." What is that?

00:37.872 --> 00:39.082
Maybe he likes you.

00:39.165 --> 00:40.583
Huh?

00:40.667 --> 00:42.168
And maybe you like him?

00:42.252 --> 00:44.003
Maybe that's why you're freaked out.

00:44.087 --> 00:46.130
-Maybe not. Maybe I don't.
-Maybe so.

00:46.214 --> 00:49.676
Maybe I think about him a little bit,
just in my dreams, though.

00:49.759 --> 00:52.595
And I've changed
a couple of my passwords to "Scott"

00:52.679 --> 00:55.974
because it's the perfect
number of letters for a password,

00:56.057 --> 00:58.309
S-C-O-T-T.

00:58.393 --> 01:01.271
But there's no... I have to stress pee.

01:01.396 --> 01:02.355
[laughs] Okay.

01:03.231 --> 01:05.275
I think we should help her chill out.

01:05.358 --> 01:08.820
I saw this amazing thing
on <i>Anderson Cooper 360,</i>

01:08.903 --> 01:11.489
<i>AC360</i> for those of us
within the Coop Troop.

01:11.573 --> 01:13.283
It was like a meme...

01:13.366 --> 01:15.451
meets a prank/trend.

01:15.535 --> 01:18.079
Why do you insist on behaving
like I'm your friend?

01:18.162 --> 01:19.747
Okay, here's what we do, right?

01:19.831 --> 01:22.333
We grab a phone
when the friend is not looking,

01:22.417 --> 01:25.586
we scroll through their contacts,
randomly select one person,

01:25.670 --> 01:28.548
and we text them, "How ya doing?" [laughs]

01:28.631 --> 01:30.591
Oh, my God. I'm gonna do it.

01:30.675 --> 01:32.093
Will you keep a look out?

01:32.176 --> 01:34.971
-I'm not even listening.
-Let's pick a funny name...

01:35.054 --> 01:36.973
-[grumbling]
-...and send, "How ya..."

01:37.056 --> 01:38.057
Think it has an apostrophe?

01:38.141 --> 01:40.852
-Oh, she's coming. Ah!
-[cell phone chimes]

01:43.563 --> 01:46.316
Did you have fun in the bathroom?

01:46.399 --> 01:47.483
There was a line.

01:47.567 --> 01:49.527
Okay. [laughing]

01:50.111 --> 01:52.196
-Oh, God!
-Why's she laughing so much?

01:53.573 --> 01:56.909
I don't know. I tune her out.
I definitely recommend it.

01:56.993 --> 01:58.202
[cell phone chimes]

01:58.286 --> 01:59.954
-Look.
-Oh, God.

02:01.748 --> 02:03.833
Why is Jill Kwatney-Adelman texting me?

02:04.667 --> 02:07.420
You just got "How ya doin'?" done!

02:07.503 --> 02:09.464
[laughing] That's what's happened.

02:09.547 --> 02:12.717
-It came out of nowhere.
-Larissa, you did this? No, no.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.093
I did it, I did it.

02:14.177 --> 02:17.221
Jill Kwatney-Adelman
and I had a huge blowout.

02:17.305 --> 02:18.723
She hates me.

02:18.806 --> 02:22.060
She's not gonna wanna get a
"How you doin'?" from me.

02:22.143 --> 02:25.605
Well, you're a comedian,
so I thought you loved laughter.

02:25.688 --> 02:29.609
She is the one person
on my contact list who is a problem.

02:29.692 --> 02:31.611
Anybody else, like...

02:31.694 --> 02:34.614
like, Angela would have been-- No. Okay.

02:34.697 --> 02:36.741
Or Solange... Okay, well...

02:36.824 --> 02:39.535
Amy, or, Sar...
Joy... Jen... Bri... Sue...

02:40.370 --> 02:42.705
No. Okay, Amy.

02:43.539 --> 02:44.582
-Did I just mention her?
-Yeah.

02:44.666 --> 02:47.043
Okay, that... that wasn't right.
Jesus.

02:47.126 --> 02:51.464
My contact list is a minefield
of shattered relationships.

03:07.480 --> 03:08.815
[Maria] Thanks for seeing me, Karen.

03:08.898 --> 03:10.858
I'm worried
I've ruined all my friendships.

03:10.942 --> 03:12.819
-Friendships don't last.
-[gasps]

03:13.403 --> 03:15.863
The only friendship
you need to be concerned with

03:15.947 --> 03:18.866
is the one with the gal in the mirror.

03:18.950 --> 03:19.826
Hmm, okay.

03:19.909 --> 03:21.619
-Let me ask you something.
-Mmm-hmm?

03:22.203 --> 03:25.456
How would you feel if you got
a "How you doin'?" from yourself?

03:26.457 --> 03:27.959
That would throw me.

03:28.042 --> 03:29.710
-Good, be confused.
-Yeah. Yeah.

03:29.794 --> 03:32.130
-Sit with it.
-Well, that's great, um...

03:32.213 --> 03:33.965
but I'm just worried, 'cause like,

03:34.048 --> 03:37.135
the only two friends
who will still be friends with me

03:37.218 --> 03:38.970
are Dagmar and Larissa.

03:39.053 --> 03:40.722
Yeah, because you're bipolar

03:40.805 --> 03:42.473
and you're hard to stay friends with.

03:42.557 --> 03:44.726
People are just gonna fall by the wayside.

03:44.809 --> 03:45.810
And that's life...

03:45.893 --> 03:46.853
for you.

03:46.936 --> 03:47.937
Oh.

03:48.062 --> 03:51.691
-Get to know it.
-Okay.

03:51.774 --> 03:53.943
I'm actually bipolar II, which means--

03:54.026 --> 03:56.362
That you're twice as hard
to stay friends with...

03:56.446 --> 03:57.280
than normal.

03:57.363 --> 03:58.698
You know what they say,

03:58.781 --> 04:01.325
"Bipolar, bye-bye friends."

04:01.993 --> 04:03.119
Do they say that?

04:03.202 --> 04:05.163
I think they probably
wouldn't to your face,

04:05.246 --> 04:06.914
but they'd say it to their real friends.

04:06.998 --> 04:09.125
I think that would be funny
for all of them.

04:09.208 --> 04:10.209
[Maria] Oh...

04:11.461 --> 04:14.380
Maybe I should make things right
with Jill Kwatney-Adelman.

04:14.464 --> 04:17.175
Maybe this is a part
of my road to wellness,

04:17.257 --> 04:19.761
to reconnect, to try again.

04:20.928 --> 04:23.055
-Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah.
-Yeah?

04:23.681 --> 04:25.808
Everyone's coming
from a different place...

04:25.892 --> 04:27.977
From those places come different feelings.

04:28.060 --> 04:30.730
I need to get in touch with those people

04:30.813 --> 04:32.440
and their feelings.

04:33.107 --> 04:37.737
And then I'll never leave
another friend behind, you know?

04:37.820 --> 04:39.947
I'll call it, "No friend left behind."

04:41.282 --> 04:42.408
What did you just say?

04:42.492 --> 04:44.535
No friend left behind.

04:44.619 --> 04:47.413
That is very good. That is... very good.

04:48.039 --> 04:51.751
[chuckles] Does it give you insight
into my psyche?

04:51.834 --> 04:53.002
Oh, fuck, no. [laughs]

out of the blue,

09:47.463 --> 09:51.509
Are you prepared to propel this pug
to the pinnacle of his pooch profession?

09:51.592 --> 09:54.178
I am. Proudly.

09:55.179 --> 09:57.640
[both screaming and giggling]

09:58.474 --> 10:01.227
It's so crazy
how we're so close now.

10:01.310 --> 10:03.187
-[Jill] I know.
-Come here. Oh...

10:03.312 --> 10:04.522
-[screaming]
-Oh, God!

10:04.605 --> 10:08.359
[Maria] <i>I guess you're wondering</i>
<i>how this relationship got off track.</i>

10:08.442 --> 10:10.319
Oh, listen to this, hun-bun bear.

10:10.402 --> 10:13.572
Oprah and Gayle are gonna go
to outer space

10:13.656 --> 10:15.616
and, you know, maybe...

10:15.699 --> 10:17.785
try and broadcast a show from there.

10:17.868 --> 10:19.245
Oh.

10:19.328 --> 10:22.039
Would you go into outer space
if you had the chance?

10:23.999 --> 10:25.000
Yes.

10:26.210 --> 10:28.754
[Jill] Knock, knock, special delivery.
Fun on four legs.

10:28.838 --> 10:30.840
[Marilyn] Hi, Jill.

10:30.923 --> 10:32.675
Oh, you are such a good friend.

10:32.758 --> 10:35.886
You're just like your mom,
God rest her soul.

10:35.970 --> 10:38.180
She didn't see that
hockey puck coming, did she?

10:39.223 --> 10:40.516
And look at that!

10:40.599 --> 10:43.602
You brought that sweet,
precious Dusty with you.

10:43.686 --> 10:45.354
Maria just loves your dog.

10:45.437 --> 10:48.482
Well, that's not Dusty.
We had to put Dusty down.

10:48.566 --> 10:52.069
Well, he did it himself.
I put a gun and some pills in his crate...

10:52.153 --> 10:53.696
-and he did the rest.
-Really?

10:53.779 --> 10:57.116
This is Rusty.
She's a genetic clone of Dusty.

10:57.199 --> 10:58.993
All the good parts, none of the diarrhea.

10:59.076 --> 11:01.537
Well, look at you, playing God.

11:01.620 --> 11:04.665
I think I'm gonna go to the cafeteria...

11:04.748 --> 11:06.917
and get Rusty some Jell-O.

11:07.585 --> 11:09.086
-Have a seat.
-[Jill] Thank you.

11:09.753 --> 11:13.257
-All right, I'll be right back.
-All right. Rusty, away.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.135
How are you?

11:16.886 --> 11:18.429
I don't wanna live anymore.

11:18.512 --> 11:20.264
Oh, I heard that.

11:20.347 --> 11:21.682
So, listen...

11:21.765 --> 11:24.226
I was reading about
depression and mental illness

11:24.310 --> 11:25.769
in my latest issue of <i>Bark.</i>

11:26.186 --> 11:27.897
And it turns out
that the human brain

11:27.980 --> 11:29.815
is more like a dog's brain
than people think.

11:30.774 --> 11:34.236
Let me try something
that I do with my dogs before we compete.

11:36.947 --> 11:38.824
Who's a good boy?

11:38.908 --> 11:41.243
[gasps] Who wants num-nums?

11:41.327 --> 11:42.328
Who's gonna get it?

11:43.829 --> 11:45.414
[blows dog whistle]

11:46.248 --> 11:47.875
-Away!
-[barking]

11:50.044 --> 11:51.086
So how do you feel now?

11:51.170 --> 11:52.630
Like I want to kill myself.

11:52.713 --> 11:54.006
Oh, still?

11:55.049 --> 11:56.050
[sighs]

11:57.176 --> 11:58.177
Okay, fine.

11:58.260 --> 11:59.970
If you don't want to be happy...

12:00.054 --> 12:03.557
I will give you my permission to...

12:03.641 --> 12:04.642
let go.

12:05.893 --> 12:07.144
You just say the word

12:07.227 --> 12:09.563
and I will leave you alone with Rusty.

12:09.647 --> 12:12.107
She's worked hospice before.
She knows what to do.

12:12.191 --> 12:14.860
[inhales deeply] Okay.

12:16.737 --> 12:19.448
You won't feel a thing.
It'll take about an hour.

12:24.161 --> 12:25.996
Rusty, lights out.

12:29.917 --> 12:32.461
[Maria] <i>Rusty made several attempts</i>
<i>to kill me.</i>

12:32.544 --> 12:34.880
<i>It proved to me,</i>
<i>not that I wanted to live,</i>

12:34.964 --> 12:37.091
<i>but that I didn't want to be</i>
<i>killed by a dog.</i>

12:37.174 --> 12:38.634
<i>I have Jill to thank for that.</i>

12:38.717 --> 12:41.762
Can you believe this dingleberry,
not two months ago,

12:41.845 --> 12:43.639
was lying in the hospital all like,

12:43.722 --> 12:46.100
"I don't want to live.
I want to kill myself."

12:46.183 --> 12:48.602
Now look at her.
Having a drink, enjoying the nightlife.

12:48.686 --> 12:51.271
-[Maria chuckles]
-Aren't you glad yours truly, JK,

12:51.355 --> 12:54.358
kicked your ass and said,
"Get the H up, girl! Get it!"

12:54.441 --> 12:56.944
[laughing] I herded her
out of death's corral.

12:57.027 --> 12:59.863
Get it! Come by! Away! [laughing]

13:00.906 --> 13:02.032
That's shepherd talk.

13:02.992 --> 13:05.494
Ooh, look at my hot-as-shit
husband over there.

13:05.577 --> 13:08.372
Norm Adelman. Mmm, mmm, mmm.
He's a good boy.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.833
-Mmm-hmm.
-He's a real good boy.

13:10.916 --> 13:13.460
Maybe one day you'll get someone
to put a ring on it.

13:13.544 --> 13:16.046
-Yeah...
-[clicks tongue] Hardware. JK.

13:16.130 --> 13:18.590
Oh, yeah. Norm's pretty great. He's great.

13:18.674 --> 13:20.259
Married nine years next month.

13:20.342 --> 13:21.677
-Oh...
-Remember our wedding?

13:21.760 --> 13:23.637
Yeah, so fun!

13:23.721 --> 13:24.972
Remember you never got us a present?

13:25.055 --> 13:26.598
I feel horrible about that.

13:26.682 --> 13:29.059
Yeah.
Not horrible enough to make it right.

13:29.143 --> 13:30.436
-Oh, okay.
-[chuckles]

13:30.519 --> 13:33.772
Oh, my shit. There's my crush.

13:33.856 --> 13:35.149
Ho!

13:35.899 --> 13:37.317
-Who?
-His name's Todd.

13:38.027 --> 13:39.528
He works at Aetna with Norm.

13:39.611 --> 13:40.612
He's pretty cute.

13:40.696 --> 13:42.614
One time he was playing tennis
with Norm

13:42.698 --> 13:44.450
and he lunged in for a drop shot

13:44.533 --> 13:47.703
and totally turkey-eyeballed me. [scoffs]

13:49.246 --> 13:50.748
Know what I mean by turkey-eyeballed?

13:51.623 --> 13:52.624
No.

13:52.708 --> 13:54.126
His balls came out of his shorts.

13:54.209 --> 13:55.210
Okay.

13:56.211 --> 13:58.380
-I got to go wizzle my dizzle.
-Okay, yeah.

14:01.050 --> 14:03.135
-Hello, Todd.
-Hey.

14:03.218 --> 14:04.219
[Todd] Beer.

14:08.474 --> 14:09.725
You sure like chips.

14:11.894 --> 14:13.645
What? Oh.

14:13.729 --> 14:15.147
Yeah, sorry.

14:15.230 --> 14:16.398
This...

14:16.482 --> 14:20.736
Sometimes I eat compulsively when...
I feel anxious.

14:22.404 --> 14:23.864
I'm Todd.
I work with Norm.

14:24.698 --> 14:26.492
I'm Maria. I'm friends with Jill.

14:26.575 --> 14:28.494
I just got out of a mental hospital.

14:29.161 --> 14:30.704
Makes sense if you're friends with Jill.

14:30.788 --> 14:31.914
[laughs]

14:32.831 --> 14:33.916
[muffled] That's funny.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.377
You wanna go out sometime?

14:36.460 --> 14:38.379
What? [stutters] With me?

14:38.462 --> 14:39.755
Like on a date?

14:41.382 --> 14:43.675
Yeah? Yeah. [laughs nervously]

14:43.759 --> 14:45.552
Cool, I'll get your number. I'll call ya.

14:45.636 --> 14:46.720
Very cool.

14:49.890 --> 14:51.100
[chuckling]

14:53.394 --> 14:54.645
Do you have a new asshole?

14:54.770 --> 14:55.938
What?

14:56.063 --> 14:59.149
If you don't, I'm gonna buy you one
so I can rip it for you.

15:00.067 --> 15:02.694
-[kicks counter]
-I had dibs on Todd.

15:02.778 --> 15:04.738
What... You can't have dibs,
you're married.

15:04.822 --> 15:07.741
Shh! Don't say that.
My husband is right there.

15:07.825 --> 15:09.410
Dibs are dibs, asswipe.

15:09.493 --> 15:11.036
Consider this a friendship ender.

15:12.246 --> 15:13.414
Wait, you're just...

15:13.497 --> 15:15.666
You're gonna call off our friendship?

15:15.749 --> 15:18.043
Yeah, I am. Friendship over.

15:18.127 --> 15:21.088
If my husband asks,
it's because of the wedding present

15:21.171 --> 15:22.714
that you never gave us.

15:24.883 --> 15:26.093
Goodbye, ex-friend.

15:26.927 --> 15:29.555
I hope you enjoy
getting your butt fingered by Todd.

15:29.638 --> 15:30.639
Norm!

15:30.722 --> 15:31.723
Away.

15:38.063 --> 15:39.314
They're my ride.

15:42.151 --> 15:44.403
[Maria] God, life's so quirky, you know?

15:44.486 --> 15:46.989
[stutters] I decided to herd with Bert.

15:47.072 --> 15:48.740
Then boom, you know, I see you.

15:48.824 --> 15:51.702
It's like the universe doesn't want us
to not be friends.

15:51.785 --> 15:55.456
Whoa, look at that pretzel bread sandwich.

15:55.539 --> 15:57.207
Mmm, I want that so bad.

15:57.916 --> 15:59.751
You should get it. You deserve it.

15:59.835 --> 16:01.003
Oh, I can't.

16:01.086 --> 16:03.130
-I have celiac disease.
-Oh.

16:03.213 --> 16:05.841
-[imitates whooshing] Whoop.
-Oh.

16:05.924 --> 16:07.885
-That's the sign for celiac.
-Ah.

16:07.968 --> 16:10.387
Gluten-free since 2003.

16:10.471 --> 16:12.264
-Raise the roof.
-[man] Fuck you.

16:12.347 --> 16:14.600
I didn't... I had no idea. I didn't know.

16:14.683 --> 16:16.602
Well, we haven't really had any--

16:16.685 --> 16:18.812
Boy, that sandwich does look good.

16:18.896 --> 16:21.315
I think I'm gonna get it. [chuckles]

16:22.357 --> 16:24.151
-I have a gift for you.
-[gasps]

16:24.234 --> 16:26.528
-What?
-Yeah. It's your wedding gift.

16:26.612 --> 16:29.406
-I didn't... Yeah.
-[gasps] Thank you.

16:29.490 --> 16:30.866
Congratulations.

16:30.949 --> 16:32.451
-Oh.
-I'm sorry that I didn't

16:32.534 --> 16:35.204
give it to you before your divorce.

16:35.287 --> 16:38.582
Oh, it's okay.
It's never too late to get a present.

16:38.665 --> 16:39.958
[chuckling]

16:41.376 --> 16:42.419
It's a pizza stone.

16:42.503 --> 16:44.505
Do you hate it? Oh...

16:44.588 --> 16:46.715
Oh, God! Oh!

16:47.216 --> 16:51.428
I can't believe you can sit here
and shove that pretzel bread in my face!

16:52.221 --> 16:54.181
The only thing
I'm more allergic to than wheat

16:54.264 --> 16:56.266
is your gluten-covered bullshit!

16:56.350 --> 16:59.853
It's you and Todd Swain-Villagatos
all over again!

16:59.937 --> 17:03.941
And then you had the balls
to get me a pizza stone?

17:04.023 --> 17:06.693
How many ways
can you offend me with bread?

17:06.777 --> 17:09.946
You're like the Viet Cong of celiac!
And this is your...

17:10.030 --> 17:11.490
Bread Offensive!

17:14.117 --> 17:15.410
[Maria mumbling]

17:18.955 --> 17:21.250
Hey... No friend left behind!

17:21.333 --> 17:22.501
-What?
-Yes.

17:23.042 --> 17:26.421
I am so sorry, Jill.
I don't know what I was thinking.

17:26.505 --> 17:28.632
You are totally right.

17:28.715 --> 17:34.179
[stutters] I was very, very selfish
in ordering this pretzel bread sandwich.

17:34.263 --> 17:36.306
Sometimes my blood sugar gets low

17:36.390 --> 17:38.559
and I don't think straight.

17:38.642 --> 17:42.271
Hmm, that sounded like
it started as a true apology,

17:42.354 --> 17:44.690
-but now I'm hearing excuses.
-Okay.

17:44.773 --> 17:46.900
You're right. You're right.

17:46.984 --> 17:49.403
What I did was inexcusable.

17:49.486 --> 17:52.656
Our friendship is worth so much more to me

17:52.739 --> 17:54.366
than any pretzel bread.

17:54.449 --> 17:55.617
And?

17:55.701 --> 17:57.202
I'm sorry--

17:57.286 --> 17:58.495
And?

17:58.579 --> 17:59.955
I love you?

18:02.457 --> 18:03.292
And?

18:03.375 --> 18:06.628
I... am ready to herd sheep!

18:06.712 --> 18:08.046
That's the sign of a champion.

18:08.130 --> 18:10.173
-Oh! [sighs] Oh...
-And a friend.

18:10.257 --> 18:11.967
-A champion friend.
-Okay.

18:12.050 --> 18:13.635
-[both laugh]
-I herd that.

18:13.719 --> 18:14.928
-[both laughing]
-What?

18:15.012 --> 18:16.597
You herd? [laughs]

18:16.680 --> 18:18.932
-You herd that?
-[both laughing]

18:19.016 --> 18:21.518
Friendship, that's all that matters.

18:22.227 --> 18:24.062
[Maria] <i>No friend left behind.</i>

18:24.146 --> 18:25.689
<i>That was the answer.</i>

18:25.772 --> 18:28.275
<i>If only I had known that in the past.</i>

18:28.358 --> 18:31.737
I love my new
Maria Bamford Pepper Stepper Pepper-bot.

18:31.820 --> 18:33.488
It combines my two favorite things:

18:33.572 --> 18:35.449
jogging and peppers.

18:35.532 --> 18:37.659
Sometimes I just need to do this.

18:37.743 --> 18:39.119
[whirring]

18:39.202 --> 18:40.454
[crunching]

18:41.371 --> 18:42.414
Mmm!

18:43.665 --> 18:46.001
Oh, I'm sorry... Hey, can we...

18:46.918 --> 18:48.629
Can we stop for a second?

18:48.712 --> 18:49.921
-I can't breathe.
-[man] Cut!

18:50.005 --> 18:52.132
I'm getting pepper seeds down in my lungs.

18:52.215 --> 18:53.216
-Okay.
-[Bruce] Maria.

18:53.300 --> 18:54.509
Bruce?

18:54.593 --> 18:56.219
You're banned from this lot.

18:56.303 --> 18:57.304
Oh, fuck me.

18:57.387 --> 18:59.431
-How did you get past security?
-All I had to do...

18:59.514 --> 19:01.433
-was slip by this one--
-[grunts]

19:01.516 --> 19:02.976
Oh, God, Bruce! No, wait.

19:03.060 --> 19:04.686
I know him. Don't touch him!

19:04.811 --> 19:06.897
He's been on a shit cruise. Yeah.

19:07.522 --> 19:08.857
Oh, Bruce. [panting]

19:08.940 --> 19:10.776
Bruce, are you alive?

19:10.859 --> 19:11.860
-I'm okay.
-Okay.

19:11.943 --> 19:13.028
-It's fine.
-Okay, good.

19:13.111 --> 19:15.447
Barbara used to run me over with her car.

19:15.989 --> 19:18.158
Billy Shatner taught me
how to roll with the impact.

19:18.241 --> 19:20.702
[Karen] Well, well. Here we go again.

19:20.786 --> 19:23.455
Johnny Shit Cruise Sequoia Fucker
just came

19:23.538 --> 19:25.499
out of the sea to drag you back
to his shit ship.

19:25.582 --> 19:27.959
What're you doing
with that monkey on your back?

19:28.043 --> 19:32.297
It's not a monkey. It's a Maria Bamford
Pepper Stepper Pepper-bot!

19:32.381 --> 19:34.091
[Pepper-bot speaks]
[Karen] The only monkey

19:34.174 --> 19:36.176
on her back is you, Bruce.

19:36.343 --> 19:37.511
Fuck off, tree!

19:37.594 --> 19:38.804
Shrub, actually.

19:38.887 --> 19:40.180
You never fed me peppers.

19:40.263 --> 19:42.641
I'm a mogul. I'm a brand!

19:42.724 --> 19:44.976
I'm a tastemaker, I'm a pacemaker.

19:45.060 --> 19:47.437
-Preach!
-I'm an earthquaker, I'm J. Lo.

19:47.521 --> 19:49.231
-Better than that. I'm M. Lo.
-Word!

19:49.314 --> 19:50.691
-Better than that, I'm M. Bam.
-Word.

19:50.774 --> 19:52.943
I'm better than that,
I'm Bam, Bam, Bam...

19:53.026 --> 19:55.320
Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam...

19:55.404 --> 19:57.072
-[Maria continues]
-Listen to the biotch.

19:57.155 --> 19:59.282
Listen to my biotch.

19:59.366 --> 20:01.451
[Maria and Pepper-bot] Bam, Bam, Bam...

20:02.119 --> 20:03.537
She's really funny, right?

20:04.621 --> 20:06.623
Bam. I keep getting better. God!

20:06.707 --> 20:07.833
Suck it, life!

20:07.916 --> 20:09.710
Maria, you're talking way too fast.

20:09.793 --> 20:11.420
You're really getting me scared.

20:11.503 --> 20:13.672
-Are you okay?
-Well, I'm okay.

20:13.755 --> 20:15.757
I'm more than okay. You're the tree.

20:16.717 --> 20:17.718
I'm a shrub.

20:17.801 --> 20:20.971
Look at you, just out there
thinking about yourself.

20:21.054 --> 20:22.055
Just like trees!

20:22.139 --> 20:25.392
This is what you do.
You play the sympathy card.

20:25.475 --> 20:26.560
You're a manipulator.

20:26.643 --> 20:28.645
That's why Kindler stays.

20:28.729 --> 20:31.022
That's why Barbara stays.

20:31.106 --> 20:32.941
On that point, allow me to correct you.

20:33.024 --> 20:34.776
-Barbara has not stayed.
-[Karen] Know what?

20:34.860 --> 20:37.446
You should just change your name
to Boo-hoo-ruce.

20:38.280 --> 20:40.532
Boo-hoo-ruce!

20:40.615 --> 20:42.784
Boo-hoo-ruce!

20:42.868 --> 20:44.745
Boo-hoo-ruce!

20:44.828 --> 20:48.081
[all chanting] Boo-hoo-ruce!
Boo-hoo-ruce!

20:48.165 --> 20:50.876
Boo-hoo-ruce! Boo-hoo-ruce!

20:50.959 --> 20:53.920
-[chanting continues]
-You know, I had this exact dream.

20:54.546 --> 20:57.048
I'm standing here, dressed like a shrub,

20:57.132 --> 21:00.177
being openly derided
by a group of my betters.

21:00.260 --> 21:01.887
[chanting continues] Boo-hoo-ruce!

21:01.970 --> 21:02.971
[Pepper-bot] Boo-hoo-ruce!

21:03.054 --> 21:05.182
-Boo-hoo-ruce!
-[chanting stops]

21:06.516 --> 21:07.517
So that's it, Maria?

21:08.435 --> 21:09.978
We're over?

21:10.103 --> 21:11.563
Friendship and all?

21:11.646 --> 21:13.398
[voice trembling] Yes, Bruce.

21:14.399 --> 21:15.400
We're over.

21:15.484 --> 21:16.485
[sighs]

21:18.028 --> 21:19.946
I'll always cherish you.

21:21.490 --> 21:22.574
[straining]

21:24.993 --> 21:26.661
-[muffled crying]
-You don't need him.

21:26.745 --> 21:28.413
-You're one of us now.
-Okay.

21:28.497 --> 21:30.040
I'm proud of you.

21:32.334 --> 21:33.960
I'm proud of you, too.

21:34.669 --> 21:36.671
-Come here. Come here.
-Okay.

21:36.755 --> 21:38.548
-[grunts]
-Ow.

21:42.886 --> 21:45.514
[Maria] <i>Bruce was a true friend</i>
<i>and I left him behind.</i>

21:45.972 --> 21:48.517

[Maria] Bert, what's wrong, kid?

21:52.521 --> 21:54.940
Aren't you excited to compete?

21:55.023 --> 21:57.526
Come on, I know
you want to share your gifts.

[announcer over PA]

21:59.069 --> 22:01.446

22:01.530 --> 22:02.948
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

22:03.031 --> 22:04.032
He's just a little off.

22:04.449 --> 22:05.617
You better get him on.

22:05.700 --> 22:07.786
We need him for the group scores.
If Bert doesn't compete, we lose.

22:07.869 --> 22:10.121
-He just doesn't seem into it.
-[whimpering]

22:10.205 --> 22:12.290
I don't know what... Oh...

22:12.374 --> 22:14.125
You need to be the alpha, Maria.

22:14.209 --> 22:15.544
He doesn't know what he wants.

22:15.627 --> 22:17.003
You tell him what you want.

22:17.087 --> 22:20.423

We want you, if you can, to try--

[announcer] <i>Final call for Bert Bamford.</i>

For fuck's sake, give me the dog.

22:24.678 --> 22:26.263
[Bert whines frantically]

22:26.346 --> 22:28.223
No, he doesn't like that!

22:28.306 --> 22:30.600
Nobody likes that!

22:33.311 --> 22:35.230
[panting]

22:36.523 --> 22:37.857
[distorted voice] No!

22:41.611 --> 22:42.862

22:42.946 --> 22:46.032
Jill Kwatney-Adelman, née Kwatney,

22:46.116 --> 22:51.788
I embarked upon this personal quest
to honor my promise to the universe,

22:51.871 --> 22:53.915
to leave no friend left behind.

22:53.999 --> 22:57.919
Jill Kwatney-Adelman, née Kwatney...

22:58.003 --> 22:59.004
friend...

23:00.839 --> 23:03.717
I leave thee... behind.

23:06.636 --> 23:07.846
Oh, that's great.

23:08.430 --> 23:09.848
Fuck you, Maria!

23:11.266 --> 23:13.560
-And fuck you.
-[dog whimpers]

23:15.353 --> 23:17.063
[Maria sobbing]

23:24.321 --> 23:27.616
I'm sorry. So sorry. I'm sorry, Bert.

23:31.536 --> 23:34.122
[sobbing] I'm so sorry, Bert.

23:34.205 --> 23:35.999
You had great talent

23:36.082 --> 23:40.670
and I let my bullshit interfere
in your destiny.

23:40.754 --> 23:42.922
[Bert] Sweet Maria.

23:43.006 --> 23:45.216
Oh, Bert. [sobbing]

23:45.300 --> 23:48.136
[Bert] It was never my destiny
to herd sheep.

23:48.219 --> 23:52.390
This wrinkled, slobbering body
is capable of many great things.

23:53.058 --> 23:57.562
I am a painter, philosopher,
writer of poetry,

23:57.646 --> 24:01.024
-but I desire to do none of these things.
-Okay.

24:01.107 --> 24:05.779
[Bert] I choose to lie upon
the hardwood floor, snoring my life away.

24:05.862 --> 24:07.238
Yeah.

24:07.322 --> 24:09.491
And occasionally shitting where I sleep.

24:10.158 --> 24:11.409
Oh.

24:11.493 --> 24:12.994
[Bert] The truth of the matter is

24:13.078 --> 24:17.874
I was the gasoline that inflamed
Jill Kwatney-Adelman's fire

24:17.957 --> 24:21.419
and revealed her awful, demonic force.

24:21.503 --> 24:25.215
You bear no responsibility
for her striking me.

24:25.298 --> 24:27.050
For like Jesus on the cross...

24:27.801 --> 24:31.680
-I sacrificed myself for you...
-[chuckles]

24:31.763 --> 24:35.892
...so you might see that
she was no friend at all.

24:35.975 --> 24:39.479
And ergo, could and indeed,
must be left behind.

24:40.105 --> 24:41.147
Oh.

24:41.231 --> 24:45.527
Your promise to the universe
remains unbroken.

24:45.610 --> 24:47.362
[sobbing] Bert.

24:48.613 --> 24:49.948
Bert!

24:53.326 --> 24:55.370
You are a true friend.

24:55.453 --> 24:59.999
You are one friend
who I will never leave behind!

-[cell phone chimes]
-Oh. [chuckles]

25:03.837 --> 25:05.004
[gasps] It's from Scott.

25:05.088 --> 25:07.257
[Bert] What does his text say?

25:07.340 --> 25:09.843
He says, "How you doin'?" Huh.

25:09.926 --> 25:11.010
Is he saying hi?

25:11.094 --> 25:13.722
Or is he doing that
<i>Anderson Cooper 360</i> prank meme?

25:13.805 --> 25:18.059
[Bert] I can only lead you so far.
You are no sheep.

25:18.143 --> 25:21.271
It is your job to decide indeed

25:21.354 --> 25:24.441
if this is just an <i>Anderson Cooper 360</i>
viral prank meme,

25:24.524 --> 25:29.279
or if this is an opportunity
to really feel something.

25:30.238 --> 25:31.489
I got it, Bert.
