WEBVTT

00:00.240 --> 00:03.840
Please, don't try anything you're about to see at home.

00:04.030 --> 00:05.840
We're what you call experts.

00:09.890 --> 00:11.930
On this episode of Mythbusters:

00:12.090 --> 00:14.730
I'm gonna have to warn my mom before she watch this episode.

00:16.090 --> 00:19.910
Adam and Jamie face off in an epic battle of fire...

00:20.170 --> 00:21.950
That is insane!

00:21.950 --> 00:22.930
and ice.

00:25.120 --> 00:27.310
They want to test the viral video claim

00:27.310 --> 00:28.730
that a fire extinguisher

00:28.730 --> 00:31.170
can protect you from a flame thrower.

00:34.340 --> 00:35.370
I lived!

00:35.670 --> 00:36.640
Holy @#￥%……&.

00:36.980 --> 00:38.400
Then, in the desert,

00:38.400 --> 00:39.670
This is so cool!

00:39.690 --> 00:42.060
Kari, Grant and Tory go high tech...

00:42.060 --> 00:45.290
OK, helicopter's in position, and ready for the test.

00:45.290 --> 00:48.570
to take on a myth from the movie "Body of Lies".

00:48.600 --> 00:49.980
I'm getting ready to be kidnapped.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.970
Using a car induced dust cloud,

00:52.100 --> 00:54.090
can you really cloak your movements

00:54.090 --> 00:56.430
from high-altitude a spy drone?

01:01.520 --> 01:03.350
Who are the "Mythbusters"?

01:04.519 --> 01:05.540
Adam Savage,

01:05.540 --> 01:06.850
It's scientific.

01:06.850 --> 01:08.090
and Jamie Hyneman.

01:08.240 --> 01:09.640
Fun for the whole family.

01:10.230 --> 01:14.410
Between them, more than 30 years of special effects experience.

01:14.850 --> 01:16.540
Together with Kari Byron,

01:16.540 --> 01:18.430
I was less excited after my first kiss.

01:18.430 --> 01:19.670
Tory Belleci,

01:19.680 --> 01:21.380
Why are we doing this?

01:21.450 --> 01:22.580
and Grant Imahara.

01:23.200 --> 01:24.450
Who wants some?

01:24.550 --> 01:26.290
They don't just tell the myths,

01:27.360 --> 01:29.650
they put them to the test.

01:41.470 --> 01:42.460
What's on the docket?

01:42.600 --> 01:44.420
Something you and I know quite well,

01:44.420 --> 01:45.850
the meeting of opposites.

01:45.850 --> 01:47.560
You're goona have to be more specific.

01:47.630 --> 01:49.110
Okay. Fire versus ice.

01:49.350 --> 01:51.070
It's a viral video that's been going around

01:51.140 --> 01:52.460
where two hillbillys pull up

01:52.530 --> 01:54.600
into the middle of nowhere and face off,

01:54.670 --> 01:56.210
one armed with a flame thrower,

01:56.290 --> 01:58.110
the other armed with a fire extinguisher.

01:58.270 --> 02:00.040
They both fire their devices

02:00.040 --> 02:02.060
and fire and ice meet in the middle.

02:02.130 --> 02:03.810
And apparently, according to the clip,

02:03.810 --> 02:05.080
cancel each other out.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.660
Dibs on the flame thrower.

02:07.200 --> 02:08.530
Don't you want to hear more about the story?

02:08.630 --> 02:09.190
No.

02:09.479 --> 02:10.289
All right then.

02:10.660 --> 02:11.590
Roll the clip.

02:13.680 --> 02:16.500
What do you get when you cross an internet viral video

02:17.170 --> 02:18.730
and an elemental duel?

02:19.030 --> 02:22.020
An epic clash of fire and ice.

02:23.890 --> 02:26.960
But can you actually beat back a flame thrower attack

02:27.020 --> 02:29.900
with a plume of CO2 from a fire extinguisher?

02:30.950 --> 02:33.440
The team want to know if these striking images

02:33.610 --> 02:36.740
are film fakery or fiery fact.

02:37.190 --> 02:38.370
So, where do you want to begin?

02:39.030 --> 02:40.370
Oh, let's say we set up a small scale

02:40.370 --> 02:41.710
as a proof of concept.

02:41.850 --> 02:42.880
I mean, I can throw together

02:42.880 --> 02:44.520
a little flame thrower in minutes.

02:45.050 --> 02:47.300
But, as I'm thinking about it, you know,

02:47.300 --> 02:50.580
they show a normal CO2 fire extinguisher in that clip.

02:50.650 --> 02:52.440
And I'm not so sure they fire that far.

02:52.790 --> 02:53.940
Easy enough to figure out.

02:54.000 --> 02:54.870
We've got one down stairs.

02:54.930 --> 02:57.700
Let's just throw up a gauge and see how far it propels.

02:57.700 --> 02:58.710
Okey.

03:01.120 --> 03:04.240
So, before the guys throw down small scale flames...

03:04.830 --> 03:06.270
Well, let's scale it up.

03:06.270 --> 03:07.050
they're going to check

03:07.050 --> 03:09.780
that a standard 15-pound fire extinguisher,

03:09.860 --> 03:11.010
like the one in the clip,

03:11.010 --> 03:13.320
can even go the required distance.

03:14.100 --> 03:17.200
So, 25 times 6 is 150.

03:17.640 --> 03:19.140
60 feet between these guys,

03:19.140 --> 03:20.850
which means each of these things

03:21.560 --> 03:23.710
has to shoot 30 feet

03:23.730 --> 03:25.550
in order to meet in the middle, at least.

03:25.570 --> 03:26.690
Yeah, at least.

03:26.980 --> 03:28.230
That's the mark to match.

03:28.230 --> 03:30.490
But first here's Professor Savage

03:30.590 --> 03:32.370
for "Firefighting 101".

03:32.370 --> 03:33.470
Here's what you don't understand.

03:33.470 --> 03:34.720
There is nothing special about these.

03:34.720 --> 03:37.400
These are your standard issue run of the mill

03:37.470 --> 03:40.430
what we call 15-pound CO2 fire extinguishers.

03:40.430 --> 03:42.150
CO2 means carbon dioxide.

03:42.160 --> 03:43.160
And that's what they are filled with.

03:45.030 --> 03:47.130
And when pull the pin and squeeze the lever,

03:47.140 --> 03:49.740
that CO2 comes out of the nozzle at the bottom of this cone,

03:50.400 --> 03:51.840
and it flashes to a gas.

03:51.840 --> 03:54.920
That CO2 gas comes out in a big smoky billow,

03:54.950 --> 03:56.990
creating a nonoxygenated environment

03:57.000 --> 03:59.040
where fire can't burn.

03:59.700 --> 04:00.760
The question we are concerned with

04:00.760 --> 04:03.650
is will it actually fire out 30 feet?

04:03.650 --> 04:06.060
Honestly, I don't think so.

04:06.060 --> 04:07.770
But that's why we are doing this test.

04:07.770 --> 04:10.090
Three, two, one.

04:16.209 --> 04:17.510
I think that's pretty far.

04:18.100 --> 04:20.540
The target to get the myth over the first hurdle

04:20.579 --> 04:22.000
was around 30 feet.

04:22.130 --> 04:24.330
And after studying the high speed footage,

04:24.330 --> 04:25.450
Adam's happy.

04:25.580 --> 04:28.610
I'd say that the unmodified fire extinguisher

04:28.680 --> 04:31.480
fired its gaseous billow 25 feet,

04:31.810 --> 04:34.570
which is shockingly close to the clip.

04:34.590 --> 04:37.340
I think it's time to put it up

04:37.380 --> 04:39.140
against Jamie's impromptu flame thrower.

04:40.690 --> 04:43.390
Impromptu and top secret.

04:43.390 --> 04:44.560
Even though we tell people

04:44.560 --> 04:46.190
not to do what we do at home,

04:46.530 --> 04:48.710
when it comes to home made flame throwers,

04:49.030 --> 04:50.640
I'm just not gonna show you how to do it.

04:50.640 --> 04:51.960
With the curtain closed

04:51.960 --> 04:53.860
on the flame thrower puppet show,

04:55.010 --> 04:57.210
it's on to a proof of concept test.

04:57.220 --> 04:59.190
And they won't be shooting it in the shop.

04:59.420 --> 05:00.970
Obviously, we can't be squirting

05:00.970 --> 05:02.930
lit gasoline around inside in shop.

05:02.930 --> 05:05.670
So, we've come to the San Francisco Fire Department

05:05.670 --> 05:07.330
Treasure Island Training Facility.

05:08.970 --> 05:10.870
I'm ready to do battle with the Hyneman.

05:11.150 --> 05:12.440
And we're goona to do it here.

05:12.440 --> 05:13.970
But do what exactly?

05:13.970 --> 05:15.690
The whole point of this exercise is to see

05:15.780 --> 05:18.630
if my fire extinguisher can have any appreciable effect

05:18.710 --> 05:20.990
on Jamie's flame thrower.

05:21.230 --> 05:24.520
And to do it, he'll be wearing the full fire-proof suit,

05:24.520 --> 05:27.020
or what he likes to call, his dancing suit.

05:27.390 --> 05:28.860
How do you want to do this thing?

05:29.240 --> 05:30.460
Well, for safety's sake,

05:30.460 --> 05:32.740
why don't I stay put with my stream of fire

05:32.780 --> 05:34.950
and you kinda walk into it with the extinguisher.

05:34.980 --> 05:36.810
I like that better than the alternative.

05:36.810 --> 05:38.070
- Let's do it.  - Okay.

05:39.460 --> 05:40.880
So, in small scale,

05:40.980 --> 05:42.140
Adam and Jamie are looking to

05:42.140 --> 05:44.050
explore the concept of the myth.

05:44.800 --> 05:49.210
All right, fire extinguisher versus flame thrower, small scale.

05:49.250 --> 05:50.240
Is it possible...

05:50.300 --> 05:51.210
I'm ready.

05:52.030 --> 05:55.340
that a standard work place CO2 fire extinguisher

05:55.370 --> 05:57.170
like the one in the viral video...

05:57.370 --> 05:58.520
Let's light her up.

05:59.970 --> 06:03.730
can snuff out an airborne jet of flaming gasoline?

06:10.730 --> 06:13.160
Next up, Tory, Grant and Kari

06:13.190 --> 06:15.700
kick up a dust storm for a kidnapping.

06:15.860 --> 06:16.770
All right, guys, what do we got?

06:16.890 --> 06:18.700
This one involves fast cars,

06:18.700 --> 06:20.500
dust storms and spy drones.

06:20.500 --> 06:23.040
Are we testing the myth from the movie "Body of Lies"?

06:23.090 --> 06:24.540
Yes. And this is the one

06:24.540 --> 06:26.870
where Leonardo Dicaprio is getting kidnapped,

06:26.870 --> 06:29.110
but he's being monitored by a spy drone.

06:29.210 --> 06:31.890
Now, to fool the drone, his kidnappers show up in cars,

06:32.020 --> 06:33.890
drive in a circle, create a dust storm

06:33.890 --> 06:35.000
effectively blinding it.

06:35.170 --> 06:36.980
This would be awesome to test.

06:40.250 --> 06:42.690
It's a classic scene from the silver screen.

06:42.690 --> 06:44.700
In the movie "Body of Lies",

06:44.970 --> 06:48.610
a band of highly organized SUV driving bad guys

06:49.140 --> 06:52.440
kidnap our hero by cleverly cloaking their movements

06:52.440 --> 06:55.700
from a high altitude spy drone with a dust cloud.

06:57.250 --> 07:00.410
But can a manufactured-by-motor dust storm

07:00.410 --> 07:04.040
really blind state-of-the-art military technology?

07:04.690 --> 07:07.090
Now, my gut feeling is, this could possibly work.

07:07.090 --> 07:08.900
I mean, have you ever driven on a dusty road

07:08.900 --> 07:09.770
behind somebody?

07:09.770 --> 07:11.570
The car in front of you disappears.

07:11.610 --> 07:13.620
Yeah, but that's when you're enveloped in dust.

07:13.620 --> 07:14.880
This myth is about someone

07:14.880 --> 07:16.820
observing from above the dust cloud.

07:16.910 --> 07:19.680
I think the good news is, we don't need a spy drone.

07:19.800 --> 07:21.440
I think we can get the same kind of camera

07:21.440 --> 07:22.720
and mount it onto something else in there,

07:22.720 --> 07:23.660
like a helicopter.

07:23.660 --> 07:25.320
All right, well it sounds like all we need now

07:25.320 --> 07:26.230
is a dusty location,

07:26.230 --> 07:28.120
some SUVs and a target to kidnap.

07:28.470 --> 07:30.480
Oh, one more thing, you're totally blind

07:30.480 --> 07:31.670
when you are driving in a dust storm.

07:31.670 --> 07:33.150
So, maybe we need to come up with

07:33.150 --> 07:35.230
some sort of a system for driving in a circle

07:35.230 --> 07:37.440
without actually being able to see.

07:37.440 --> 07:39.970
Yeah. I guess driving blind could be disastrous.

07:41.420 --> 07:42.360
Correct.

07:43.080 --> 07:45.650
By the time the team takes this test to the desert,

07:45.680 --> 07:49.110
they'll require the military like precision and planning

07:49.110 --> 07:51.740
to safely carry out the dangerous driving

07:54.240 --> 07:57.440
So, it's a trip to the emergency vehicle operation's course...

07:57.790 --> 07:59.600
Let's have some fun.

08:00.390 --> 08:02.200
where Grant and Tory will test

08:02.200 --> 08:04.010
the safty precautions necessary

08:04.050 --> 08:07.130
to pull off the sand-eye-blind driving the myth requires.

08:07.910 --> 08:10.880
It's gonnal require laser sharp concentration.

08:13.490 --> 08:14.540
Sorry @#￥%……&.

08:16.660 --> 08:19.150
Oh, no, @#￥%……&!

08:20.570 --> 08:23.640
Grant didn't get the laser sharp concentration memo.

08:24.310 --> 08:25.370
We haven't even started,

08:25.370 --> 08:27.450
and it's a lot more dangerous than we thought.

08:28.740 --> 08:31.430
Now, since what we are doing is creating a dust storm,

08:31.440 --> 08:33.360
which means limited visibility.

08:33.620 --> 08:35.429
And since we don't want to crash into each other,

08:35.500 --> 08:38.030
we are instituting a number of safety procedures.

08:38.140 --> 08:40.830
Every car will be outfitted with this strobe light.

08:41.120 --> 08:44.690
It's got a portable rumble strip in the form of this chain.

08:47.520 --> 08:49.420
Lay this out along the perimeter,

08:49.420 --> 08:51.330
and that will tell us when we are on path.

08:51.450 --> 08:53.310
And we'll gonna take these delineators

08:53.310 --> 08:55.670
and create a giant circle that the cars can follow,

08:55.810 --> 08:57.650
and we're gonna have a slapstick on the front of the car,

08:57.650 --> 08:59.820
so when the car passes by, it hits it,

08:59.870 --> 09:01.810
letting the driver know that he's still on track.

09:01.810 --> 09:03.520
It's kind of like a giant "Wheel of Fortune."

09:05.170 --> 09:06.990
And because we don't have our own dust storm,

09:06.990 --> 09:09.940
we are going to create our own dust storm with opaque paper.

09:10.820 --> 09:12.220
Ready for a dust storm?

09:12.480 --> 09:13.360
Bye-bye.

09:14.710 --> 09:16.240
What could possibly go wrong?

09:17.940 --> 09:20.260
With the paper supposedly simulating

09:20.260 --> 09:21.760
the visibility of a dust storm...

09:21.840 --> 09:22.780
I'm ready.

09:22.900 --> 09:25.460
and one fender-bender already under their belt,

09:25.830 --> 09:27.840
the team starts slow and careful.

09:28.220 --> 09:28.870
All right.

09:28.910 --> 09:30.430
Let's start at five miles an hour

09:30.430 --> 09:32.480
and move up to ten miles an hour.

09:32.480 --> 09:35.820
In three, two, one, drive.

09:36.060 --> 09:39.180
With just two drivers and not the full set of four,

09:39.310 --> 09:42.210
the question is, can they drive nearly blind...

09:42.210 --> 09:43.210
Start braking.

09:43.210 --> 09:45.080
and in a tight circle safely.

09:45.080 --> 09:46.660
You're way off course, stop.

09:46.660 --> 09:48.030
The answer would appear to be...

09:48.340 --> 09:50.020
no, no, they can't.

09:53.180 --> 09:54.390
Where the hell am I?

09:56.310 --> 09:59.260
Next, Jamie super sizes his sizzler...

09:59.480 --> 10:01.400
It's 100% illegal.

10:01.890 --> 10:04.310
while Adam pumps up the gas.

10:15.730 --> 10:17.920
This viral video suggests that

10:17.920 --> 10:19.650
if a mean-looking dude is going to

10:19.650 --> 10:21.230
fire a flame thrower at you,

10:21.340 --> 10:24.650
you can hold back the flames with a fire extinguisher.

10:24.990 --> 10:28.280
Apparently, the cloud of CO2 will balance out

10:28.280 --> 10:30.960
the burning gasoline by meeting it in the middle.

10:32.920 --> 10:33.790
I'm ready.

10:34.490 --> 10:35.460
First up though...

10:35.570 --> 10:36.620
Okay, bring it in.

10:38.730 --> 10:40.930
Adam and Jamie want to know how to go

10:40.930 --> 10:43.230
with a more modest-sized flame thrower.

10:45.520 --> 10:46.330
That worked.

10:49.830 --> 10:51.920
It certainly put out Jamie's fire,

10:52.200 --> 10:55.060
but it wasn't an unqualified success.

10:55.430 --> 10:57.160
It seems my effective distance

10:57.160 --> 10:59.730
is really about this distance,

10:59.730 --> 11:01.490
not like the full 20 feet.

11:01.660 --> 11:04.270
Yeah, it's interesting, it seems that there has to be

11:04.270 --> 11:06.930
absolutely complete coverage of the CO2,

11:07.050 --> 11:08.250
or it's gonna continue to burn.

11:08.930 --> 11:11.500
Something the thermal imaging camera backs up.

11:12.250 --> 11:13.900
The cold jet of CO2

11:13.900 --> 11:16.790
only becomes truly effective at close range.

11:16.980 --> 11:18.040
That's a problem,

11:18.040 --> 11:19.920
because the myth would have us believe

11:19.970 --> 11:24.030
it can hold back a full-sized flame thrower 25 feet away.

11:25.760 --> 11:27.380
And a close look at the high speed

11:27.380 --> 11:30.390
confirms the poor result in terms of distance.

11:30.750 --> 11:33.520
Okay. I'm definitely pushing the flame back in here,

11:33.590 --> 11:35.770
at just under ten feet.

11:36.090 --> 11:37.670
I think I'm about to put it -- there it is.

11:37.730 --> 11:38.380
I put it out.

11:38.900 --> 11:41.080
But you had to almost be covering me

11:41.290 --> 11:44.740
with the CO2 froth to go out, and in the clip...

11:44.740 --> 11:45.800
They're 60 feet apart.

11:45.800 --> 11:48.590
So I absolutely need to beef that thing up.

11:48.730 --> 11:50.490
Yep, based on the results so far,

11:50.670 --> 11:52.800
the team believes the standard extinguisher

11:52.800 --> 11:55.030
used in the clip will have no chance.

11:55.600 --> 11:56.960
And if that's the case,

11:56.960 --> 11:59.800
Adam wants a backup, to ramp it up.

12:00.020 --> 12:02.050
So, he'll be making a second extinguisher

12:02.050 --> 12:06.060
with extensive modifications and using the force.

12:06.780 --> 12:07.750
Here's what's happening,

12:08.070 --> 12:10.380
I clearly need more power.

12:11.720 --> 12:13.440
I'm going to start the experiment process

12:13.440 --> 12:16.050
by measuring the 15-pound fire extinguisher,

12:16.120 --> 12:17.510
using my pressure swingometer.

12:19.080 --> 12:20.370
And I'm gonna be comparing that

12:20.370 --> 12:22.020
against all my subsequent measurements

12:22.020 --> 12:23.730
from all the modifications I'm gonna make.

12:24.040 --> 12:25.450
It might seem that what's happening here

12:25.450 --> 12:26.450
is the meeting of opposites--

12:26.450 --> 12:28.600
fire, and the thing that puts out the fire.

12:28.670 --> 12:30.140
But in fact, it's actually just about force.

12:30.400 --> 12:31.980
The fire's pushing forward with the force,

12:32.010 --> 12:34.860
and I need to meet that with an equal and opposite force.

12:34.970 --> 12:37.970
I don't need a white billowy cloud went to 25 feet.

12:38.160 --> 12:41.690
I need to push the fire back from 25 feet.

12:41.960 --> 12:42.650
So I'm going to start by

12:42.650 --> 12:44.020
increasing the size of my extinguisher.

12:46.020 --> 12:48.800
I will go from 15 pounds to 50 pounds.

12:51.110 --> 12:52.900
Then with a few modifications,

12:52.970 --> 12:54.800
we'll see if I can get that pressure wave

12:54.800 --> 12:56.820
extending out almost 25 feet.

12:57.000 --> 12:57.910
Go.

12:58.640 --> 13:00.950
While Adam looks to beef up his blast,

13:03.230 --> 13:06.510
Jamie invites his inner pyromaniac to the party,

13:06.610 --> 13:09.630
by making a military grade flame thrower.

13:09.630 --> 13:12.810
My task now is to make an honest-to-goodness flame thrower.

13:12.860 --> 13:14.440
That's gonna be the manifold.

13:14.460 --> 13:18.200
And given that we are using high pressures, flammable fluids

13:18.290 --> 13:19.680
and they are lit,

13:19.680 --> 13:22.800
I need to make sure that whatever I'm using is really sturdy.

13:23.080 --> 13:26.210
With that in mind, I'm gonna use these air tanks.

13:26.300 --> 13:28.590
They're made for thousands of psi.

13:28.760 --> 13:30.290
So, given that we are only gonna be

13:30.290 --> 13:32.400
putting hundreds of psi in them,

13:32.470 --> 13:34.760
I figure that they're gonna be plenty safe for us to use.

13:35.100 --> 13:36.970
The air tanks will contain the fuel.

13:38.460 --> 13:40.180
But as for the details on the rest,

13:40.220 --> 13:42.010
well, we can't show you that.

13:42.010 --> 13:43.920
Seriously, this thing right here

13:43.920 --> 13:45.270
is in a league of its own.

13:45.270 --> 13:47.140
It's 100% illegal.

13:47.440 --> 13:49.960
We were able to do it only under the direct supervision

13:49.960 --> 13:52.410
of a number of different governmental agencies.

13:52.420 --> 13:54.640
And let me tell you, it was an ordeal.

13:54.920 --> 13:57.480
So, don't even think about it.

13:58.970 --> 14:01.700
Which gives you an idea of what Adam is up against.

14:02.950 --> 14:04.610
And after toying with a variety

14:04.610 --> 14:06.880
of nozzles, outlets and tubing,

14:06.990 --> 14:09.640
he decides H2O is the way to go,

14:09.710 --> 14:12.990
in order to tackle Jamie's super sized sizzler.

14:14.250 --> 14:15.090
Try it out.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.890
to the CO2 stream to try and get more force.

14:20.990 --> 14:22.420
I want to push back this fire.

14:22.420 --> 14:24.020
And that's where this comes in.

14:24.030 --> 14:25.930
It's a pressurized container full of water,

14:25.940 --> 14:27.730
and I'm gonna feed through this tube

14:27.800 --> 14:30.110
into a nozzle on the side of this nozzle,

14:30.110 --> 14:31.090
which very much looks like this,

14:31.090 --> 14:33.100
water comes in here, CO2 comes out here.

14:33.130 --> 14:35.420
Hopefully, what ends up coming out of the business end

14:35.420 --> 14:37.940
of the cone has a lot more force behind it.

14:42.630 --> 14:43.890
Dude!

14:46.840 --> 14:48.020
That was great.

14:48.200 --> 14:50.830
Adam wanted more force and he's got it.

14:51.120 --> 14:54.360
Mixing the stream of water to the super cold CO2

14:54.520 --> 14:57.750
results in a cloud of fire quenching ice crystals.

14:58.090 --> 15:00.080
And the additional massive of water

15:00.300 --> 15:02.750
adds that much more force to the equation.

15:06.220 --> 15:07.490
I've got my flame thrower,

15:07.490 --> 15:09.790
and Adam has his beefed up fire extinguisher.

15:11.120 --> 15:13.500
I guess there is nothing to do now but to take them out,

15:13.500 --> 15:15.830
put them head to head and see what happens.

15:20.150 --> 15:22.180
Kari, Grant and Tory are taking on

15:22.180 --> 15:25.770
a hollywood tall tale of international espionage.

15:26.090 --> 15:29.110
Can you really use a car-induced dust storm

15:29.300 --> 15:32.080
to fool the aerial eye of a spy drone?

15:34.620 --> 15:37.460
And to safely recreate the dangerous driving

15:37.460 --> 15:38.530
required in the myth...

15:39.710 --> 15:40.640
Sorry @#￥%……&.

15:40.870 --> 15:42.930
the team's gonna need a lot of practice.

15:43.590 --> 15:44.550
Start braking.

15:45.260 --> 15:46.970
You're way off course. Stop.

15:47.170 --> 15:50.140
But after a tough frustrating day of testing

15:50.140 --> 15:51.670
and tweaking their guidance systems,

15:51.970 --> 15:53.540
they realized the real issue

15:53.540 --> 15:56.040
has been right in front of their eyes all along.

15:57.010 --> 15:58.760
I can't see bugger all.

15:58.980 --> 16:00.280
The basic thing we misjudged

16:00.280 --> 16:02.050
is the transparency of our paper.

16:02.200 --> 16:05.290
We were trying to get around 10 to 15% visibility.

16:05.340 --> 16:07.940
But we ended up with basically 0% visibility.

16:07.940 --> 16:09.940
Right now, we can't see anything.

16:10.270 --> 16:11.910
So we're gonna have to come back tomorrow,

16:12.070 --> 16:13.590
and come up with a better solution

16:13.590 --> 16:15.130
to simulate the sandstorm.

16:16.570 --> 16:19.850
Yep, what's required is a new day, a new location,

16:20.070 --> 16:23.480
and a plan named after the second letter of the alphabet.

16:25.660 --> 16:27.390
And this is plan B.

16:27.590 --> 16:29.920
We'll put this burlap on the our windshields.

16:31.720 --> 16:34.020
And this should give us about 10% visibility,

16:34.140 --> 16:35.270
that of a dust storm.

16:35.680 --> 16:37.470
Confident in their new solution,

16:37.470 --> 16:38.810
the team has stripped back

16:38.810 --> 16:41.200
their safety systems to the bare minimum,

16:41.240 --> 16:44.670
and upped the ante by matching the myth's four cars.

16:45.180 --> 16:47.700
So, with Grant coordinating communications...

16:47.870 --> 16:50.430
Three, two, one, go.

16:52.770 --> 16:56.040
and Tory, Kari and two mythterns behind the wheel,

16:56.200 --> 16:58.600
it looks like they have nailed the visibility issue.

16:59.650 --> 17:00.930
Yeah, it's been good.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.390
Because although they can just barely see,

17:03.500 --> 17:07.099
the view, just like in a dust storm, is severely limited.

17:07.180 --> 17:09.200
And it's only their safety systems

17:09.319 --> 17:10.630
that are keeping them on track.

17:12.720 --> 17:13.630
This is insane!

17:13.740 --> 17:15.569
And that means, they can go to work...

17:15.680 --> 17:17.160
Everybody could just speed up a little.

17:17.170 --> 17:20.500
practicing their four-car dust-making dance.

17:20.569 --> 17:22.160
This is working!

17:22.190 --> 17:23.710
Let's take it to the desert.

17:33.080 --> 17:36.070
Adam and Jamie are about to turn up the heat...

17:36.890 --> 17:39.130
Nice day for a flame thrower.

17:39.130 --> 17:41.510
armed and extremely dangerous.

17:41.510 --> 17:43.980
It's my own personal kick ass version

17:43.980 --> 17:45.840
of a military flame thrower.

17:45.880 --> 17:48.540
They have arrived at exactly the right location.

17:48.730 --> 17:50.750
The first rule of firing a flame thrower

17:50.820 --> 17:51.820
in the state of California is

17:51.820 --> 17:53.150
that you pretty much can't do it.

17:53.800 --> 17:57.110
But if somehow you get permission to do it, like we have,

17:57.470 --> 17:58.560
you need to do it in a place

17:58.620 --> 17:59.790
where you're not going to set anything on fire.

17:59.900 --> 18:01.190
That's what brings us here

18:01.190 --> 18:04.130
to the Yolo county bomb range in northern California.

18:04.390 --> 18:05.890
Acres of barren landscape

18:05.980 --> 18:09.010
where we can fire our flame thrower to our heart's content.

18:09.250 --> 18:11.810
The danger lies in the risky combination

18:11.810 --> 18:14.070
of flammable liquids and high pressure.

18:14.070 --> 18:15.500
And here's how it works.

18:15.520 --> 18:17.060
I've got two tanks full of fuel.

18:17.190 --> 18:18.580
I've got a third tank

18:18.580 --> 18:20.550
full of inert gas at high pressure

18:20.780 --> 18:23.720
that I will use to pressurize the fuel tanks,

18:23.720 --> 18:25.630
such that when I pull on the lever,

18:26.180 --> 18:29.120
all of that fuel will empty out the end of this gun,

18:29.200 --> 18:31.730
and burn in about four seconds.

18:31.790 --> 18:35.730
Cue pyrotechnician extraordinary, J. D. Streett,

18:35.860 --> 18:38.600
the man tasked with overseeing the safe use

18:38.740 --> 18:41.360
for extremely dangerous piece of equipment.

18:43.550 --> 18:45.960
And with the tanks now filled with gasoline...

18:46.740 --> 18:48.200
Secondary valve opening up.

18:48.200 --> 18:49.080
Adam and Jamie...

18:49.080 --> 18:49.990
Safety is off.

18:50.170 --> 18:53.340
get set for the first live lit test.

18:54.200 --> 18:54.950
You're open.

18:54.950 --> 18:57.100
The gun is hot, the pressure on.

18:57.100 --> 18:58.820
It's time to let rip.

18:58.870 --> 19:00.050
First flame test.

19:00.050 --> 19:04.110
In three, two, one.

19:09.470 --> 19:10.680
Dude!

19:15.580 --> 19:16.420
That worked.

19:16.500 --> 19:17.380
That worked.

19:17.540 --> 19:19.840
That was spooky as hell.

19:20.430 --> 19:23.720
Jamie just test-fired our home-built flame thrower,

19:23.720 --> 19:25.720
and it worked fantastically.

19:25.720 --> 19:27.130
I think that might be the scarest thing

19:27.130 --> 19:29.180
that's ever been built on this show.

19:29.370 --> 19:30.420
It's right up there.

19:31.730 --> 19:34.910
It looked to spray a wand of hot death,

19:35.100 --> 19:36.610
between 60 and 80 feet,

19:36.610 --> 19:38.830
which is exactly where we wanted it to be.

19:42.340 --> 19:45.640
The stream of burning gasoline successfully matches

19:45.640 --> 19:48.340
the mythical clip for distance and volume.

19:48.620 --> 19:50.100
But for the test itself,

19:50.100 --> 19:53.590
Adam will have to stand in the line of fire, literally.

19:53.870 --> 19:56.010
To do that, he's going to use a safehouse.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.100
And here's one he prepared earlier.

19:58.100 --> 19:58.910
Right here.

19:59.500 --> 20:02.140
Before we actually conduct the full size experiment,

20:02.140 --> 20:03.640
we need to make sure that my shield here

20:03.640 --> 20:05.570
will actually do its job.

20:06.150 --> 20:08.000
I need to be able to stand in the path

20:08.000 --> 20:09.690
of this flame thrower, and not get burnt.

20:09.690 --> 20:10.610
Are you ready?

20:10.690 --> 20:11.590
I'm ready.

20:11.630 --> 20:14.080
So, Jamie's going to point it right at this thing

20:14.080 --> 20:16.540
while there is no one behind it, and fire.

20:16.820 --> 20:20.710
And only if we determined that will safely keep me from getting burnt

20:20.720 --> 20:21.690
are we going to use it.

20:21.820 --> 20:25.220
Glass house flame test,

20:25.910 --> 20:30.000
in three, two, one.

20:39.940 --> 20:41.590
That looks like it might keep me safe.

20:41.890 --> 20:42.900
It looks good.

20:43.270 --> 20:45.220
All the devices are working perfectly.

20:45.270 --> 20:47.360
The flame looks exactly like it does

20:47.430 --> 20:49.100
in the clip that we are trying to replicate,

20:49.500 --> 20:52.040
and the glass house seems to be holding up just fine,

20:52.040 --> 20:53.600
so I think Adam is going to be safe.

20:54.790 --> 20:56.080
I think that worked beautifully.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.210
Now, what we gotta do is wait for it to get dark.

20:59.430 --> 21:00.920
Jamie's not lying.

21:01.040 --> 21:02.910
because to match the mythical clip

21:02.910 --> 21:05.080
and face off with fire and ice

21:05.140 --> 21:08.120
they need a atmospheric nighttime backdrop.

21:08.810 --> 21:10.450
Next on "Mythbusters,"

21:10.510 --> 21:14.540
the team decamp to a deserted dusty desert location.

21:14.610 --> 21:16.880
You can't tell, but I'm smiling right now.

21:19.490 --> 21:23.050
Please do not try what you're about to see at home.

21:23.120 --> 21:24.710
We're what you call experts.

21:24.770 --> 21:25.650
Can't you tell?

21:31.930 --> 21:35.240
Unmanned military spy drones are state of the art,

21:35.290 --> 21:36.330
eyes in the sky.

21:36.470 --> 21:38.250
But is it possible to obscure

21:38.520 --> 21:43.290
nefarious ground level activities from their cameras with a dust cloud?

21:47.810 --> 21:50.270
To find out, the team has decamped

21:50.330 --> 21:54.140
to a dramatic and cinematic deserted desert location.

21:55.060 --> 21:57.140
This is beautiful!

21:57.210 --> 21:59.790
And at first light, it's time for action.

21:59.860 --> 22:01.890
We've come out to the Black Rock Desert in Nevada

22:01.940 --> 22:03.790
so that we can test our "Body of Lies" myth.

22:03.850 --> 22:06.250
Now that's that you can hide from a drone in a dust storm.

22:06.310 --> 22:07.720
This should be the perfect location

22:07.770 --> 22:10.030
because it's entirely gypsum dust.

22:11.910 --> 22:13.180
So here's the set up,

22:13.240 --> 22:15.550
we are gonna create a giant ring out here in the desert,

22:15.550 --> 22:17.870
similar to our practice run,

22:18.870 --> 22:20.030
Hi, let's set it up.

22:20.090 --> 22:22.940
drive around in a circle to create our dust storm.

22:24.090 --> 22:25.290
Kari is gonna be our target.

22:25.600 --> 22:27.080
We're gonna be driving around her,

22:27.120 --> 22:28.490
and create as much dust as we can.

22:28.530 --> 22:29.720
When we get enough dust,

22:29.790 --> 22:31.660
we are gonna put her into one of the SUVs

22:31.730 --> 22:33.850
and then all of them are gonna go in different directions.

22:34.560 --> 22:36.900
And I will spot from the helicopter

22:36.970 --> 22:40.290
and try and guess which of the cars the target is in.

22:40.700 --> 22:42.650
My feeling is, if we create enough dust,

22:42.720 --> 22:44.020
he's not gonna be able to tell.

22:44.610 --> 22:46.150
The circle is complete.

22:47.180 --> 22:50.920
So the first order of business for Tory and his team of drivers

22:50.990 --> 22:54.530
is a practice run to find out if the dust making conditions

22:54.590 --> 22:56.000
are the same as in the movie.

22:56.890 --> 22:58.540
Now let's if we can kick up some dust.

22:58.610 --> 23:00.380
The drivers start off slow,

23:00.450 --> 23:03.070
using their high visibility cones to stay on track.

23:04.450 --> 23:05.930
They build up speed.

23:06.010 --> 23:08.090
You can't tell but I'm smiling right now.

23:08.250 --> 23:12.240
And the result down here at ground level at least is impressive.

23:12.340 --> 23:13.100
I think it's gonna work.

23:13.180 --> 23:15.040
The thick dust hanging in the air,

23:15.110 --> 23:16.920
makes for tough driving conditions.

23:17.220 --> 23:18.910
Holy crap.

23:18.920 --> 23:20.250
Look how hard it is to see.

23:20.460 --> 23:23.170
And it looks just like the mythical movie scene,

23:23.250 --> 23:27.340
but the true test will come once Grant gets an aerial perspective.

23:27.430 --> 23:30.000
So we're not using a spy drone in this myth,

23:30.070 --> 23:31.190
we are using a helicopter.

23:31.240 --> 23:32.910
We've got the same type of camera,

23:32.980 --> 23:35.690
the same lens and we're gonna set up the same framing

23:35.690 --> 23:38.410
for judging this dust cloud.

23:38.800 --> 23:42.350
It's as close as you can get to flying a spy drone without

23:42.410 --> 23:45.380
actually flying a spy drone out of a military base.

23:46.430 --> 23:47.030
All right,

23:47.280 --> 23:50.260
I'm ready to be the kidnap target in this dust storm.

23:50.320 --> 23:52.760
Now unlike the movie, I'm actually going to be in this car here.

23:53.120 --> 23:56.350
This is for my protection because, let's face it,

23:56.660 --> 24:01.310
four cars going around in circles in a practically blind dust storm

24:01.370 --> 24:03.840
just doesn't seem like a good place to be standing around.

24:07.720 --> 24:09.700
And that means it's go time.

24:10.050 --> 24:12.570
Grant "Eye in the sky" Imahara,

24:12.640 --> 24:15.350
establishes a high altitude vantage point.

24:15.830 --> 24:19.510
Ok, we are in position, ready to begin the test.

24:21.160 --> 24:22.450
Just like the Movie,

24:22.520 --> 24:25.180
lead driver Tory and his three accomplices,

24:25.260 --> 24:27.300
surround kidnapping target Kari.

24:28.020 --> 24:31.760
We're starting test one for our "Body of Lies" target acquisition.

24:32.040 --> 24:34.330
And increase the speed of circling,

24:34.400 --> 24:38.020
attempting to mask their actions from Grant with a dust cloud.

24:41.020 --> 24:41.830
Will it work?

24:42.200 --> 24:44.260
We're starting to get a really good dust cloud.

24:44.510 --> 24:46.100
When the team on the ground decide

24:46.100 --> 24:48.150
the dust cloud thickness is at its apex,

24:48.150 --> 24:50.080
they decide to go for it.

24:50.120 --> 24:51.470
I'm getting ready to get kidnapped.

24:53.260 --> 24:55.500
With swift military like precision,

24:55.560 --> 24:58.900
one of the cars pulls out of the circle and alongside Kari.

24:59.880 --> 25:00.770
Here we go.

25:03.430 --> 25:04.330
I've got her.

25:05.160 --> 25:07.150
From the ground, as she jumps in,

25:07.220 --> 25:09.220
the scene is pretty much obscured,

25:09.300 --> 25:10.980
but was it a success?

25:11.030 --> 25:14.300
Was Grant and his high tech drone camera fooled?

25:14.690 --> 25:16.160
All right, did you see me?

25:32.140 --> 25:35.250
It's hot versus cold at 60 feet

25:35.320 --> 25:38.040
or as we used to refer to when Jamie was duelling a lot

25:38.300 --> 25:40.810
in the olden days, ten paces.

25:40.870 --> 25:44.250
I will be armmed with a fifteen pound standard issue

25:44.310 --> 25:45.890
cone-tipped fire extinguisher.

25:47.480 --> 25:50.290
And I've got four gallons of high pressure gasoline

25:50.290 --> 25:52.610
that's gonna give me a good 60 feet.

25:53.950 --> 25:55.580
If the clip is real,

25:55.630 --> 25:59.550
my white CO2 plume of smoke ought to meet his fireball

25:59.880 --> 26:01.150
somewhere in the middle.

26:06.080 --> 26:09.520
The myth suggests a standard 15-pound fire extinguisher

26:09.840 --> 26:11.860
could stop an attack from a flame thrower

26:12.140 --> 26:15.150
by meeting it in midair 25 feet away

26:15.510 --> 26:17.650
and effectively putting it out.

26:20.230 --> 26:23.170
However, as the less than spectacular performance against

26:23.460 --> 26:25.860
Jamie's small scale flame thrower proved,

26:26.160 --> 26:30.250
it is unlikely Adam is going to successfully beat back the burn.

26:32.730 --> 26:33.990
This is gonna be scary.

26:38.850 --> 26:40.460
This's a funny thing about flame throwers,

26:40.500 --> 26:42.860
you are not supposed to place yourself in their path,

26:42.920 --> 26:45.110
so we've taken every precaution.

26:45.600 --> 26:46.960
Ok, everyone set?

26:47.040 --> 26:47.730
We're going hot.

26:47.790 --> 26:51.800
This house is made of fireproof glass, fireproof silicone, steel,

26:52.260 --> 26:54.130
wooden sides that will keep the fire

26:54.130 --> 26:55.850
from wrapping around and enveloping me.

26:56.920 --> 27:00.220
I'm also wearing a full proximity suit with a hood.

27:00.740 --> 27:02.750
On my command of go.

27:03.220 --> 27:03.900
Ready.

27:04.030 --> 27:06.440
All of this should keep me perfectly safe.

27:06.850 --> 27:08.750
Well we're about to find out.

27:08.830 --> 27:12.220
But just in case, Adam's mom, please look away now.

27:12.340 --> 27:14.340
Two, one, go!

27:26.340 --> 27:28.440
I lived! Holy @#￥%……&.

27:28.970 --> 27:30.250
That was awesome.

27:31.530 --> 27:34.050
I don't think my fire extinguisher did very much.

27:35.420 --> 27:37.000
But that was awesome.

27:40.340 --> 27:42.600
Yep, that was a little too much fire

27:42.600 --> 27:44.430
for Adam's little extinguisher.

27:44.490 --> 27:45.970
Tonight this is something else.

27:46.040 --> 27:47.470
Three, two, one and then...

27:47.750 --> 27:49.080
hellfire.

27:50.150 --> 27:54.270
You just pulled the trigger and wait for it to run out.

27:54.340 --> 27:55.320
It seemed to me like

27:55.320 --> 27:59.770
I was pretty much bathing Adam and his little house in fire.

27:59.870 --> 28:02.390
I don't think my extinguisher did very much

28:02.390 --> 28:03.590
because for most of that test,

28:03.910 --> 28:07.930
all I could see was fire enveloping my entire little house.

28:08.670 --> 28:09.980
And I was totally protected.

28:10.050 --> 28:11.820
It worked just like we planned.

28:11.900 --> 28:13.630
The safety precautions worked.

28:13.690 --> 28:17.610
Adam successfully survived five terrifying seconds

28:17.760 --> 28:19.990
inside a giant fireball.

28:20.170 --> 28:22.240
But as for an actual result,

28:22.310 --> 28:24.060
it's over to the high speed footage.

28:25.710 --> 28:28.510
I'm not having any effect on you whatsoever.

28:29.050 --> 28:30.710
Completely enveloped in a fireball there.

28:31.630 --> 28:34.660
It was like a mountain of fire rolling towards you.

28:35.150 --> 28:36.750
That is insane!

28:37.070 --> 28:39.830
I'm gonna have to warn my mom before she watches this episode.

28:39.890 --> 28:41.160
She's gonna think I died in there.

28:41.240 --> 28:43.000
The clip is pretty much busted,

28:43.040 --> 28:46.660
but remember, I suspected it might not work

28:46.710 --> 28:49.330
which is why I built this bad boy.

28:49.780 --> 28:52.990
It's got a 1,500 psi high capacity

28:52.990 --> 28:55.140
ball valve water in feed

28:55.140 --> 28:57.220
to get the most amount of pressure

28:57.220 --> 29:00.140
and volume out of the CO2 cloud as I possibly can.

29:04.260 --> 29:05.410
I'm ready, Hyneman!

29:05.480 --> 29:06.840
In the test in the shop,

29:07.500 --> 29:10.400
I was able to have a significant amount of back pressure

29:10.400 --> 29:11.850
at 25 feet.

29:11.900 --> 29:13.620
That really ought to allow me

29:13.680 --> 29:16.610
to push Jamie's fire ball back to where it belongs,

29:16.670 --> 29:18.020
away from my little house here.

29:19.320 --> 29:22.870
Meeting Jamie's flame in the middle may be a tough ask.

29:22.940 --> 29:23.700
I'm ready!

29:23.940 --> 29:26.360
But can Adam's modified monster

29:26.420 --> 29:27.010
I'm ready!

29:27.090 --> 29:30.120
even improve his chances of survival?

29:30.170 --> 29:32.570
Three, two, one.

29:39.300 --> 29:40.660
This is so cool.

29:40.730 --> 29:42.200
We have our own helicopter.

29:42.900 --> 29:44.060
We got these vehicles.

29:44.940 --> 29:47.810
We're tearing up and down the desert creating dust clouds,

29:47.880 --> 29:49.330
trying to hide Kari from

29:49.390 --> 29:50.650
the cameras in the sky.

29:50.710 --> 29:52.690
I mean I feel like a big kid

29:52.780 --> 29:54.840
playing in a sandbox with all these toys.

29:56.380 --> 29:58.630
But with the dust settling on test one,

29:58.680 --> 30:02.750
did Tory and his toys manage to kidnap Kari successfully?

30:03.760 --> 30:05.380
All right, did you see me?

30:05.550 --> 30:09.060
Did Grant spot which vehicle Kari was smuggled into?

30:09.540 --> 30:12.480
It's the car that went toward our camp.

30:12.750 --> 30:14.210
You got me!

30:18.180 --> 30:19.640
Grant had it covered.

30:19.640 --> 30:22.940
In the key area, the center of the circle above Kari,

30:22.990 --> 30:25.200
the dust cloud just wasn't thick enough to

30:25.240 --> 30:29.280
deceive the pin sharp resolution of the military-grade camera.

30:30.190 --> 30:33.360
Now if you look at the amount of dust being created by these SUVs,

30:33.690 --> 30:35.180
it looks like a lot.

30:35.230 --> 30:37.610
But from the air, it's a totally different story.

30:37.720 --> 30:40.210
It looks like a ring of dust

30:40.260 --> 30:41.870
and in the middle is Kari's car

30:41.870 --> 30:43.470
which is still perfectly visible.

30:43.510 --> 30:45.950
So if Tory and Kari are gonna get away with the kidnap,

30:46.010 --> 30:47.990
they're gonna have to come up with a different technique.

30:48.130 --> 30:49.510
All right, we're making those donuts,

30:49.510 --> 30:50.910
Grant's having no problem seeing us.

30:50.960 --> 30:53.260
Yeah we're not kicking up the dust that you see in the movie.

30:53.310 --> 30:54.800
But one thing I happen noticing

30:54.800 --> 30:57.500
is when we're flying across the desert at a high speed,

30:57.500 --> 30:58.790
we are kicking up so much dust.

30:58.860 --> 31:00.470
So maybe we set up the cars

31:00.470 --> 31:02.460
and we just fly by them at high speeds

31:02.460 --> 31:05.060
and hopefully we create a dust cloud thick enough

31:05.120 --> 31:06.270
that we hide you from Grant.

31:08.040 --> 31:10.050
With the donut technique busted,

31:10.100 --> 31:12.220
Tory and Kari have another plan they hope

31:12.220 --> 31:15.340
will put this myth back on a straight and narrow,

31:16.590 --> 31:20.210
a plan based on the theory that a high speed fly by

31:20.260 --> 31:24.070
creates more dust that circling the target at moderate speeds.

31:24.430 --> 31:26.420
Ok, helicopter's in position

31:26.480 --> 31:27.740
and ready for the test.

31:30.500 --> 31:32.760
This is the new dust cloud plan.

31:32.820 --> 31:35.240
We have the target car which I will be waiting in.

31:35.250 --> 31:38.260
We're going to have two kidnap vehicles pull alongside of it.

31:39.020 --> 31:41.830
Here comes the two kidnappers.

31:44.350 --> 31:47.750
Then we have Tory and another dustmaker car

31:47.750 --> 31:49.290
zooming by as fast as they can

31:49.600 --> 31:51.830
creating a huge dust cloud.

31:55.450 --> 31:57.920
Here comes the dust cloud makers.

31:59.650 --> 32:03.060
One dust car, two dust cars.

32:12.510 --> 32:16.600
Then Grant has to guess what vehicle I am in.

32:17.110 --> 32:18.140
And what do you know?

32:19.970 --> 32:21.640
I can't see anything!

32:22.840 --> 32:25.000
I cannot see anything.

32:25.440 --> 32:28.210
By driving past upwind at high speed,

32:28.250 --> 32:30.790
a thick cloud of dust perfectly obscures

32:30.790 --> 32:32.590
the scene of the kidnapping crime.

32:33.340 --> 32:35.640
Ok, they're all driving off.

32:38.270 --> 32:39.290
I don't know.

32:39.550 --> 32:40.660
I'm not sure.

32:40.730 --> 32:44.000
And Grant doesn't have a clue which car Kari is in.

32:44.480 --> 32:45.820
We did it! Yeah!

32:47.230 --> 32:50.200
Ok, so the dust cloud that we were able to create

32:50.200 --> 32:53.580
actually made a canopy so that Grant could not find me.

32:54.100 --> 32:55.930
Dude, I thought that was totally gonna be busted,

32:55.960 --> 32:59.080
but it turns out you beat the video camera.

32:59.150 --> 33:01.040
Yeah, we beat the video camera.

33:01.080 --> 33:02.430
You know, that's what they had in the movie,

33:02.510 --> 33:05.470
but we know the drones also have thermal cameras.

33:07.280 --> 33:10.360
And they would easily been able to switch over to thermal camera

33:10.630 --> 33:12.160
and see the heat signature.

33:12.200 --> 33:14.350
I say we set this up again with flare camera

33:14.410 --> 33:17.100
and see if we can hide the person with the dust cloud.

33:17.520 --> 33:19.150
All right, I'm ready for another shot.

33:19.250 --> 33:20.900
Let's see if we can fool you this time.

33:21.890 --> 33:23.630
Coming up on "Mythbusters",

33:23.830 --> 33:26.930
What does it take to beat a thermal imaging camera?

33:33.840 --> 33:36.520
So far the myth that you can hide from a spy drone's video camera

33:36.720 --> 33:39.500
by creating a dust cloud is kind of a mixed bag.

33:39.530 --> 33:40.690
See on the one hand,

33:40.780 --> 33:42.950
if you use the ring method like they do in the movie,

33:43.010 --> 33:44.020
that doesn't work at all.

33:44.310 --> 33:45.880
All right, did you see me?

33:45.950 --> 33:48.900
It's the car that went towards our camp.

33:48.960 --> 33:50.830
But if you use the method that we came up with,

33:50.830 --> 33:52.310
which is the high speed fly-by,

33:52.470 --> 33:53.800
that does works.

33:53.800 --> 33:56.550
And it is able to visually obscure you from the camera.

33:57.730 --> 33:59.390
I can't see anything!

34:00.790 --> 34:02.900
I cannot see anything.

34:03.210 --> 34:04.340
We're not done yet,

34:04.500 --> 34:06.280
because it turns out these spy drones

34:06.290 --> 34:08.310
are equipped with another type of technology,

34:08.989 --> 34:11.420
forward-looking infrared cameras.

34:11.489 --> 34:13.300
These pick up heat signatures.

34:13.350 --> 34:15.800
It should have no problem picking out a warm body

34:15.860 --> 34:18.429
even if it's obscured by a dust cloud.

34:18.639 --> 34:20.230
There's nowhere to hide now.

34:20.850 --> 34:22.639
Grant's right to be confident,

34:22.699 --> 34:26.570
unmanned drones are regularly used on search and rescue missions,

34:26.630 --> 34:30.409
and they're duly equipped with state-of-the-art camera technology,

34:30.460 --> 34:32.270
including thermal imaging,

34:32.270 --> 34:35.460
to find and locate human heat signatures.

34:36.960 --> 34:38.909
And that means to beat Grant,

34:39.020 --> 34:42.909
Okay, helicopter is in position and ready to go.

34:47.639 --> 34:51.489
Kari and Tory will really have to get their spy on.

34:51.620 --> 34:53.219
Because on this test,

34:53.290 --> 34:56.800
Grant's using a full range of technology at his disposal.

34:59.260 --> 35:01.480
Here come the dust makers.

35:02.810 --> 35:04.450
There's the cloud.

35:04.530 --> 35:06.980
As before, the high speed fly-by cloud

35:06.980 --> 35:09.510
obscures the regular video camera.

35:13.140 --> 35:14.170
Get in there.

35:15.950 --> 35:16.910
Oh yeah!

35:16.990 --> 35:17.900
I see her.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.980
I've got your number, Kari.

35:20.120 --> 35:24.180
But the heat signature from the scurrying bodies is as bright as,

35:24.480 --> 35:26.320
as bright as their body temperature.

35:26.610 --> 35:28.080
you're in the car on the right.

35:28.130 --> 35:29.440
It was really a game changer,

35:29.500 --> 35:32.370
where as they were obscured visually with the dust,

35:32.430 --> 35:33.600
with the flare camera,

35:33.840 --> 35:35.150
I can see right through that.

35:35.190 --> 35:38.770
I could see like little white dots walking between vehicles,

35:38.820 --> 35:42.360
so that made it really easy to pick out where Kari went.

35:43.800 --> 35:46.200
All right, you could run from the thermal imaging camera,

35:46.200 --> 35:47.210
but you can't hide.

35:47.280 --> 35:48.370
Apparently.

35:48.450 --> 35:49.880
But you know what, I'm inspired.

35:49.930 --> 35:51.170
We fooled you with dust,

35:51.220 --> 35:53.920
I think we can actually cloak ourselves from that camera as well.

35:53.980 --> 35:55.690
I think the challenge is on,

35:55.760 --> 35:56.760
and you're going down, sucker.

35:56.760 --> 35:58.020
All right, let's see!

35:59.690 --> 36:02.630
And to take down spy master Imahara,

36:02.700 --> 36:07.410
team kidnap heads back to the shop for a camouflage conversation.

36:07.470 --> 36:11.140
So we need to find out if it's even possible to beat the infrared camera.

36:11.190 --> 36:13.220
So, we're gonna send it into the sky,

36:13.290 --> 36:14.770
just as if it was the drone,

36:14.830 --> 36:18.270
and see if we can come up with the technique to get by it undetected.

36:19.700 --> 36:21.080
Psychedelic.

36:21.150 --> 36:24.280
Now, Kari and Tory do have some info to go on.

36:26.860 --> 36:30.540
After all, they previously been successful at beating an

36:30.550 --> 36:33.710
infrared motion camera with a glass screen.

36:34.700 --> 36:37.530
Using that knowledge, they've got a head start,

36:37.630 --> 36:40.430
but these are different circumstances.

36:40.490 --> 36:42.230
All right, glass works, but

36:42.430 --> 36:43.270
Look at that.

36:43.340 --> 36:44.900
you need a huge piece.

36:44.950 --> 36:48.220
It's just gonna be too heavy, too cumbersome and too dangerous.

36:48.290 --> 36:50.110
Yeah, it's far from practical,

36:50.190 --> 36:52.690
so they play with a few similar ideas.

36:53.040 --> 36:57.520
Before Kari comes up with an even "cooler" idea.

37:05.630 --> 37:07.730
That makes a huge cloud above you.

37:07.810 --> 37:10.490
You can't see anything. The whole thing turns black.

37:10.550 --> 37:13.130
But will a cold blast of CO2

37:13.130 --> 37:16.900
work well enough to fool eagle-eyed Imahara's thermal camera?

37:20.170 --> 37:21.850
Well, let's find out.

37:21.900 --> 37:23.740
It's the final showdown.

37:23.750 --> 37:26.960
Ok. We are good to go, good to go in the helicopter.

37:27.020 --> 37:29.070
The set-up is the same as before.

37:29.410 --> 37:31.720
Ok. Kidnap vehicles, move in.

37:36.090 --> 37:37.690
The kidnap team is going to

37:37.690 --> 37:40.870
create a dust cloud to block the standard video camera.

37:41.180 --> 37:42.280
Okay, Here they go.

37:43.310 --> 37:45.280
But this time, in addition,

37:45.380 --> 37:48.770
the team adds a little cool CO2 to the mix.

37:53.090 --> 37:55.610
What the heck is that?

37:55.820 --> 38:00.140
That is two clouds of thermal camera obscuring CO2.

38:03.110 --> 38:05.010
I can't tell anything!

38:09.170 --> 38:13.070
And Kari is whisked away unseen by the bad guys.

38:15.390 --> 38:17.000
That was pretty cool.

38:17.370 --> 38:20.710
Now see, I thought I had them with the thermal imaging camera.

38:20.980 --> 38:23.590
When the CO2 goes off it's like this-

38:23.650 --> 38:26.430
this blue and black cloud and

38:26.490 --> 38:28.480
you can't see anything behind it.

38:30.180 --> 38:33.480
But remember, the original method used in the myth,

38:33.530 --> 38:35.540
four cars circling the victim,

38:35.610 --> 38:38.670
didn't quite pan out as well as the "Mythbuster"s' efforts.

38:39.260 --> 38:40.350
So we busted this myth

38:40.350 --> 38:43.120
but just the technique used in the Hollywood movie.

38:43.170 --> 38:45.950
It's the car that went towards our camp.

38:47.190 --> 38:48.530
We took those same elements,

38:48.590 --> 38:50.730
moving vehicles in the dusty desert,

38:50.840 --> 38:53.100
Here comes the dust cloud makers.

38:53.170 --> 38:55.050
and created a cloud so thick,

38:55.110 --> 38:58.590
we're able to obscure the high-tech cameras and kidnap Kari.

39:00.180 --> 39:02.330
But the most interesting part of this for me

39:02.390 --> 39:03.900
was actually we got to figured out

39:03.970 --> 39:06.060
how to get past the thermal camera.

39:08.630 --> 39:10.590
I can't tell anything!

39:10.970 --> 39:13.920
Getting to go back to the shop and come up with our own method

39:13.990 --> 39:16.020
and have it be better than the movies,

39:16.930 --> 39:18.050
that was awesome.

39:19.440 --> 39:21.810
Well the technique used in the movie is busted.

39:21.880 --> 39:24.820
But you can beat a video camera with a dust cloud

39:24.890 --> 39:27.660
and you can beat a thermal imaging camera with CO2.

39:27.890 --> 39:28.690
So it's possible.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.450
I just think Hollywood needs to give us a call

39:30.670 --> 39:32.270
before they write their spy movies.

39:32.650 --> 39:33.620
Hollywood, hear that? [Call us]

39:43.470 --> 39:47.790
Adam is about to face off against Jamie's super-sized sizzler

39:47.850 --> 39:49.910
with his beefed up extinguisher.

39:50.440 --> 39:52.420
I am ready!

39:55.070 --> 39:55.910
I'm ready.

39:55.950 --> 39:56.930
This is it.

39:56.990 --> 39:59.400
Even with a souped up super extinguisher,

39:59.460 --> 40:02.580
can Adam hold off Jamie and survive?

40:02.690 --> 40:05.750
Three, two, one. Go!

40:13.170 --> 40:15.600
It's difficult to tell during the chaos.

40:16.750 --> 40:20.500
But for a moment, Adam's powerful blast of ice crystals

40:20.560 --> 40:23.160
does seem to push back the tide of flames.

40:26.720 --> 40:28.140
I think I got him.

40:30.410 --> 40:32.190
Adam clearly thinks so.

40:32.250 --> 40:35.240
But to see for sure, it's over to the super slow-mo.

40:35.540 --> 40:38.710
This time Adam is actually making an impression.

40:38.740 --> 40:40.960
He may not have matched the mythical clip

40:40.960 --> 40:42.590
and met the flames in the middle.

40:43.320 --> 40:45.010
Oh, look at that!

40:45.570 --> 40:46.880
Oh, that's beautiful.

40:46.970 --> 40:48.770
But he's certainly holding them off

40:48.840 --> 40:51.420
and preventing them from engulfing the safehouse.

40:51.860 --> 40:53.600
It almost reached you.

40:54.350 --> 40:57.040
It wasn't exactly like it was in the clip.

40:57.220 --> 40:59.070
No. Oh man, look at that.

40:59.110 --> 41:01.130
I'm totally beating back the fire.

41:01.470 --> 41:03.610
It's not, definitely not meeting in the middle,

41:03.680 --> 41:06.940
but I am successfully pushing back your flame thrower.

41:07.660 --> 41:10.050
You're-you're just sneaking through by a hair,

41:10.110 --> 41:11.410
but you're holding me off.

41:11.470 --> 41:13.110
That is incredible.

41:14.930 --> 41:16.270
I feel really good.

41:16.410 --> 41:20.270
Jamie has spent literally weeks obsessed with this flame thrower

41:20.340 --> 41:23.960
and I have run my fire extinguisher and various iterations

41:24.300 --> 41:28.230
through like probably 20 to 30 separate tests in the shop.

41:28.710 --> 41:30.380
And it all came down

41:30.450 --> 41:33.420
to my 50-pounder actually pushing back

41:33.660 --> 41:34.960
Jamie's Fire ball.

41:35.020 --> 41:37.510
The first try was no competition.

41:37.570 --> 41:40.940
That flame just completely enveloped the extinguisher,

41:41.020 --> 41:44.140
the house it was inside and everything.

41:44.670 --> 41:45.750
It was no contest.

41:47.830 --> 41:49.950
The second time was a little different.

41:50.130 --> 41:52.610
He actually held me off.

41:52.920 --> 41:54.320
How do you want to call it?

41:54.390 --> 41:56.400
Unfortunately we got to say it's busted.

41:56.680 --> 41:58.460
I mean the 15-pound fire extinguisher was

41:58.510 --> 42:02.300
absolutely no match at all for your flame thrower.

42:02.350 --> 42:04.910
Even the heavy duty one that you put together

42:04.910 --> 42:07.460
just barely held me off.

42:07.530 --> 42:09.260
But it didn't look anything like the clip.

42:09.950 --> 42:11.060
This one's totally busted.

42:11.760 --> 42:13.130
Busted, but awesome!
