11:09.636 --> 11:11.004
We gotta get home.

11:11.071 --> 11:12.906
- Oh, ladies?
- Cigarette?

11:12.973 --> 11:15.508
We don't smoke.
Come on, Zelda.

11:15.575 --> 11:16.944
It's awful late.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.446
Why don't you let us
walk you ladies home?

11:19.512 --> 11:20.848
Why should we?

11:20.914 --> 11:21.849
Yeah, why should we?

11:21.915 --> 11:23.516
We can walk ourselves home.

11:23.583 --> 11:26.787
Because you're not gonna
find two more amusing fellas

11:26.854 --> 11:28.431
in this whole group of
regimental monkeys,

11:28.455 --> 11:30.023
I can tell you that.

11:30.090 --> 11:32.592
Well, you don't seem
that funny right now.

11:32.659 --> 11:35.062
That's what the gin's for.

11:35.128 --> 11:37.898
So, how's about it, ladies?

11:42.302 --> 11:43.603
Well, all right.

11:43.670 --> 11:45.773
But no getting handsy.

11:48.275 --> 11:50.878
No going to the devil,
Private Harold.

11:50.944 --> 11:53.380
Remember, all our daddies
tote guns.

11:53.446 --> 11:54.915
You watch yourself, Zelda.

11:54.982 --> 11:56.449
I'm fixin' to.

11:56.516 --> 11:58.118
Bye, now.

12:01.789 --> 12:03.957
You got one of those for me?

12:15.035 --> 12:17.938
So, where are you
from, Private Landon?

12:18.005 --> 12:21.408
Uh, my name is Lloyd.

12:21.474 --> 12:22.475
But I like Landon.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.344
It suits you.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.646
Chicago.

12:26.713 --> 12:29.149
Just outside Chicago, actually.

12:29.216 --> 12:32.019
Where are they
sending you, Landon?

12:32.085 --> 12:35.288
Just received orders to join
the 67th on Long Island.

12:35.355 --> 12:38.691
And then we're on to
the Marne to fight the Huns.

12:38.826 --> 12:40.227
France?

12:40.293 --> 12:42.362
Well, aren't you just terrified?

12:42.429 --> 12:44.564
Hell, no.

12:44.631 --> 12:46.266
I've never been abroad.

12:46.333 --> 12:48.635
This is my first time
out of Chicago,
and I'm, uh...

12:48.701 --> 12:52.705
I'm ready to see the world.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.975
My ma keeps sending
me these letters

12:55.042 --> 12:57.244
telling me to see
the Eiffel Tower.

12:57.310 --> 13:01.648
And the Arch Du Triumph
or however they say it,
but...

13:01.714 --> 13:04.617
she doesn't understand
I'm gonna be covered in mud

13:04.684 --> 13:06.319
in some trench
on the front lines.

13:06.386 --> 13:09.156
Not on a grand tour.

13:12.860 --> 13:14.127
They, uh...

13:14.194 --> 13:16.429
try to have us write
our Last Will and Testament

13:16.496 --> 13:17.865
before we go.

13:17.898 --> 13:20.968
But I ain't gonna do that.

13:21.034 --> 13:23.670
It seems like bad luck to me.

13:23.736 --> 13:26.373
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.141
Yeah.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.110
I know.

13:33.246 --> 13:35.682
I'm gonna leave Montgomery.

13:35.748 --> 13:37.484
- You are?
- Yeah.

13:37.550 --> 13:39.552
Where are you gonna go?

13:39.619 --> 13:42.589
Baltimore.
Philadelphia.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.892
Someplace that's not the South.

13:44.925 --> 13:47.027
I like the South.

13:47.094 --> 13:48.996
The women are beautiful.

13:49.062 --> 13:52.165
And the food is aces.

13:52.232 --> 13:55.068
I'm sick of all these
old buildings.

13:55.135 --> 13:57.770
Old people, old houses.

13:57.905 --> 13:59.907
Everything's old here.

13:59.973 --> 14:02.910
I want to go someplace
shiny and new

14:02.943 --> 14:05.512
that's not obsessed
with the past.

14:11.318 --> 14:13.486
Well, this is it, Landon.

14:16.089 --> 14:18.025
I don't even know your name.

14:18.091 --> 14:21.261
Miss Zelda Sayre.

14:35.442 --> 14:37.510
Well...

14:37.577 --> 14:40.147
Miss Zelda Sayre.

14:40.213 --> 14:43.383
Do you think you could
wait for a fella like me?

14:43.450 --> 14:45.318
Oh...

14:45.385 --> 14:46.953
Probably not.

14:46.954 --> 14:49.656
I don't wait for anyone.

14:49.722 --> 14:52.525
Good luck in France, Landon.

14:52.592 --> 14:55.128
I hope you get to
see the Eiffel Tower.

15:06.006 --> 15:08.641
It is 1:30
in the morning.

15:08.708 --> 15:11.111
I'm sorry, Daddy.

15:11.178 --> 15:13.013
I went for a walk with Livy,

15:13.080 --> 15:14.357
we must have lost track of time.

15:14.381 --> 15:17.384
Zelda, why must you always lie?

15:17.450 --> 15:18.851
I'm not lying, I...

15:18.986 --> 15:20.820
I saw you kiss that Yankee.

15:20.887 --> 15:22.689
And I can smell the gin

15:22.755 --> 15:24.557
and cigarette smoke
all over you.

[ scoffs ]

15:26.059 --> 15:27.794
Ish kabibble.

15:27.860 --> 15:29.362
Zelda Sayre, you come back here.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.731
You do not walk away
from your father

15:31.798 --> 15:33.533
when he is addressing you.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.902
I am ashamed that
a daughter of mine

15:36.003 --> 15:37.537
is just a little hussy,

15:37.604 --> 15:40.373
kissing strange men in front
of all our neighbors

15:40.440 --> 15:43.476
with absolutely no
sense of propriety.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.812
Well, isn't that the way
hussy's do?

15:45.878 --> 15:49.782
You just think you can
do as you please,

15:49.849 --> 15:52.085
but that's not the way
life works.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.287
Trust me, I know.

15:57.024 --> 15:58.625
I know.

16:38.098 --> 16:42.069
Mama says conflict
develops the character.

17:37.757 --> 17:39.859
Idn't it divine?

17:39.926 --> 17:41.046
Would you like to try it on?

17:41.128 --> 17:44.231
I don't know.

17:44.297 --> 17:47.033
I might like this green one.

17:47.134 --> 17:49.469
[scoffs]
Are you sure your mama

17:49.536 --> 17:52.405
would let you wear
a dress that short?

17:54.441 --> 17:56.476
Bless your heart
for your concern,

17:56.543 --> 17:59.846
but honestly,
I'm looking for something
a bit more Au courant.

17:59.912 --> 18:04.484
That is exactly what
Coco Chanel showed
in Paris this spring.

18:04.551 --> 18:07.620
You can't get more
Au courant, dear.

18:07.687 --> 18:10.290
You're right, I'll probably
have to go to New York

18:10.357 --> 18:13.159
to find something more
up to date than these
old things.

18:13.160 --> 18:16.463

about tardiness all morning.

19:08.415 --> 19:10.116
Good morning, everyone.

19:10.217 --> 19:12.519
The war continues.

19:12.585 --> 19:15.455
And so, we must continue,

19:15.522 --> 19:17.424
even redouble our efforts

19:17.490 --> 19:20.126
for membership and productivity.

19:20.227 --> 19:26.232
Today, we work on
leg and body bandages.

19:26.233 --> 19:29.969
One of you holds
the bolt of the fabric.

19:30.036 --> 19:33.005
That person is the rollee.

19:33.072 --> 19:34.807
How'd it go last night?

19:34.874 --> 19:37.277
I'll tell you later.

19:37.344 --> 19:38.878
That sounds interesting.

19:38.945 --> 19:40.813
Not to the Judge.

19:40.880 --> 19:43.783
I had a letter from
Arthur Brennan yesterday.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.918
Was it thumbs under
or forefingers under?

19:45.985 --> 19:47.019
Fingers.

19:47.086 --> 19:48.255
Who's Arthur Brennan?

19:48.321 --> 19:50.457
That boy from Atlanta
with the rich daddy.

19:50.523 --> 19:53.626
He enlisted.
He's down in El Paso.

19:53.693 --> 19:56.429
Sent me his pin and said
he'd write every day.

19:56.496 --> 19:58.064
But you don't even like him.

19:58.130 --> 19:59.130

19:59.165 --> 20:01.233
Tattle later, ladies.

At the country club?

20:19.085 --> 20:20.253
I'm not going to that thing.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.221
But it's a benefit for our boys.

20:22.289 --> 20:25.057
I know, I'm just
tired of that set.

20:25.124 --> 20:27.193
I've dated every
single one of them.

20:27.260 --> 20:29.662
They're so safe and predictable.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.698
That's why last night
was so fun.

20:31.764 --> 20:35.234
At least they're men, not props.

20:35.302 --> 20:36.382
What else are you gonna do?

20:36.436 --> 20:37.937
Stay home and read a book?

20:38.004 --> 20:41.941
Oh, Zelda, just the person
I was hoping would be here.

20:42.008 --> 20:43.543
Hello, Mrs. Riggs.

20:43.610 --> 20:46.679
I am in charge of
the entertainment
for the benefit tonight,

20:46.746 --> 20:49.882
and we'd so love it
if you would come

20:49.949 --> 20:53.420
and perform one of your
little ballet solos
for the crowd.

20:53.486 --> 20:57.023
It is always such
a hit with the young people.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.391
Right, girls?

20:58.458 --> 20:59.692
That's right.

20:59.759 --> 21:00.936
I can't think of anything better

21:00.960 --> 21:03.863
than watching Zelda
do her little dance.

21:03.930 --> 21:06.466
Let me talk to Mama.
See what she thinks.

21:06.533 --> 21:08.801
All right, dear.
You let me know.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.036
All right.

21:14.006 --> 21:15.542
Come on, Zelda.
Just do it.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.544
I don't want to, Ellie.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.111
I haven't practiced in weeks.

21:19.178 --> 21:20.580
I don't want
to look like an idiot.

You'll be the best
looking idiot in the room.

21:27.186 --> 21:29.188

you like will be there.

than spend another minute

right smart.

And so is Peyton Mathis.

21:53.880 --> 21:55.381
He already has his own business.

21:55.382 --> 21:56.983
I don't like that Mathis boy.

21:57.049 --> 21:59.552
He's too old
to be gallivanting
with you and your group.

21:59.619 --> 22:01.454
He's a rooster anyway.

22:01.521 --> 22:03.556
What does that mean?

22:03.623 --> 22:05.558
I don't need to hear
about any of that.

I just don't want you taking
up with that Mathis boy.

Oh, Judge, Sara Riggs
is really in a fix.

22:11.163 --> 22:14.400
She needs Zelda to be
the entertainment tonight.

make her own decisions.
