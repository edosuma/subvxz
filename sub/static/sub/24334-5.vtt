NARRATOR:
Apparently on Legion...

00:04.963 --> 00:06.432
LENNY:
I'm dead.

00:06.465 --> 00:09.101
You killed me.

00:09.135 --> 00:10.869
You killed me.

00:10.902 --> 00:13.105
-I... didn't.
-Yeah, you did.

00:13.139 --> 00:14.906
And I got to say, not cool, man.

00:14.940 --> 00:18.410
DAVID: Are you you at all?
Or is this just a mask?

00:18.444 --> 00:22.548
We're trapped.

00:22.581 --> 00:24.516
(both laughing)

00:24.550 --> 00:26.152
LENNY:
You got to help me.

00:26.185 --> 00:27.953
I'm like a pet.

00:27.986 --> 00:30.089
Or a houseplant.

00:30.122 --> 00:32.491
Can you talk to him?

00:32.524 --> 00:34.960
Get me out of here?

00:34.993 --> 00:38.964
What would you do?
A new life?

00:38.997 --> 00:40.466
A new body?

00:40.499 --> 00:43.802
LENNY: I'd live
the living shit out of it.

00:43.835 --> 00:46.938
And then what?

01:01.053 --> 01:03.122
(bell dings)

01:20.106 --> 01:22.274
(tone sounds)

01:22.308 --> 01:24.543
WOMAN (over P.A.):
New symptom alert.

01:24.576 --> 01:27.213
Unexplained malaise.

01:27.246 --> 01:30.816
Any shift in reality
may signal an attack.

01:30.849 --> 01:32.851
If you feel something,

01:32.884 --> 01:34.286
say something.

01:42.561 --> 01:45.097
This room is scary.

01:46.132 --> 01:48.700
Hand, please.

01:48.734 --> 01:50.136
What?

01:50.169 --> 01:53.139
Your hand.

02:01.580 --> 02:02.748
(electronic whirring)

02:02.781 --> 02:04.750
(whimpering)

02:11.089 --> 02:13.425
Ow.

02:15.961 --> 02:17.396
Name, please.

02:21.967 --> 02:24.136
Where's David?

02:24.170 --> 02:26.071
I really want to talk to David.

02:32.211 --> 02:34.180
It's right there.

02:34.213 --> 02:37.115
Say your name, please.

02:42.421 --> 02:45.624
Do you have any Benzedrine?
Bennies?

02:45.657 --> 02:48.860
Adderall? Nitrous?

02:48.894 --> 02:53.265
Maybe some Liquid Paper?
Anything?

03:00.406 --> 03:02.841
Lenny Busker.

03:02.874 --> 03:06.044
Is Lenny your given name?

03:08.814 --> 03:11.417
Lenore.

03:11.450 --> 03:13.652
After my gran-gran.

03:15.020 --> 03:16.622
She was...

03:16.655 --> 03:20.926
Let's just say she was a...

03:20.959 --> 03:23.329
real salty broad
and leave it at that.

03:23.362 --> 03:25.364
And what do you see
when you look at this?

03:28.967 --> 03:30.802
A card.

03:30.836 --> 03:34.240
And what's on the card?

03:37.343 --> 03:39.144
What do you...?

03:39.177 --> 03:41.947
Nothing. It's...
It's a blank card.

03:41.980 --> 03:44.816
Hmm.

03:49.988 --> 03:51.156
Is this...?

03:51.189 --> 03:53.859
Are you...

03:53.892 --> 03:56.695
Are you guys suspending the
laws of gravity or something?

03:56.728 --> 03:59.398
What do you see now?

04:01.433 --> 04:03.835
Look...

04:03.869 --> 04:07.205
Man, I... I'm just
here to help, okay?

04:07.239 --> 04:09.908
I... I was a...

04:09.941 --> 04:11.710
what do you...

04:11.743 --> 04:13.579
a hostage, right?

04:13.612 --> 04:15.514
-His hostage.
-Hmm.

04:15.547 --> 04:16.715
Violated.

04:16.748 --> 04:19.885
Like a puppet, so...

04:19.918 --> 04:20.986
But...

04:21.019 --> 04:25.257
Now I'm... happy ending,
I escaped.

04:25.291 --> 04:27.393
Oh. How?

04:27.426 --> 04:28.894
I just...

04:34.600 --> 04:38.904
You were a consciousness without
physical form. You are now a...

04:38.937 --> 04:42.341
living, bleeding body,
so my question to you is this:

04:42.374 --> 04:45.911
how does that occur?

04:52.384 --> 04:54.185
(whispering):
My gran-gran.

04:56.622 --> 04:59.425
She liked her Rondo citrus soda,

04:59.458 --> 05:01.693
and when I say
Rondo citrus soda, I mean,

05:01.727 --> 05:06.231
vodka in a
Rondo citrus soda can.

05:08.367 --> 05:12.771
She-she was, like,

05:12.804 --> 05:15.907
one of those clocks
that's all fives.

05:15.941 --> 05:18.377
You know, those people that say
they only drink after 5:00,

05:18.410 --> 05:22.147
but then, when you look on
their clock, it's all fives.

05:22.180 --> 05:24.550
Well, I...

05:24.583 --> 05:26.885
I would go over there
every day after school.

05:30.021 --> 05:33.959
"Happy hour," she would call it.

05:33.992 --> 05:35.827
-"Happy hour."
-Mm.

05:38.163 --> 05:41.967
Yeah, we would watch cartoons

05:42.000 --> 05:43.735
and then we would celebrate

05:43.769 --> 05:47.806
by drinking Rondo citrus soda
in a can.

05:47.839 --> 05:49.107
And I was nine.

05:49.140 --> 05:52.611
(whispering):
Are you the Shadow King?

05:52.644 --> 05:55.547
It was just me and my mom.

05:57.616 --> 05:59.585
Divorce.

05:59.618 --> 06:03.622
My mom, she wanted a big family,
but...

06:03.655 --> 06:06.392
her uterus fell out
when I was born, so...

06:06.425 --> 06:09.795
Plus, it turned out
that, um, my daddy,

06:09.828 --> 06:12.163
he liked watching black guys
bang pre-teen girls

06:12.197 --> 06:15.333
on the Internet more than he
liked, say, going to work, so...

06:15.367 --> 06:18.169
Is David coming soon?

06:18.203 --> 06:20.238
Because I-I really need
to talk to David.

06:29.247 --> 06:32.350
There are rooms
deep beneath this building

06:32.384 --> 06:36.522
where people are dumped
and forgotten.

06:36.555 --> 06:38.557
I would plan on that.

06:40.892 --> 06:43.294
He knows where the monks
hid the body.

06:43.328 --> 06:44.530
Farouk.

06:48.900 --> 06:50.936
The desert that
used to be a valley.

06:50.969 --> 06:54.406
He knows.

06:54.440 --> 06:57.108
Why did you come here?

06:57.142 --> 06:59.878
I told you. I told you, man.

06:59.911 --> 07:02.948
I'm a victim, okay? Remember?

07:02.981 --> 07:06.852
Poor old Lenny,
whose gran-gran got her drunk

07:06.885 --> 07:09.488
when she was nine and then, bam!

07:09.521 --> 07:11.322
She was just pulled
into some crazy shit.

07:11.356 --> 07:12.624
Are you clear?

07:12.658 --> 07:14.993
I was dropped inside of a wall.

07:15.026 --> 07:16.562
Are you clear?

07:16.595 --> 07:18.497
Inside of a wall.
Did you hear me?

07:18.530 --> 07:19.898
Do you know what that's like?

07:19.931 --> 07:22.768
My ass was in one room,
my tits were in another.

07:22.801 --> 07:25.937
Then he took my mind
and he made me do things, okay?

07:25.971 --> 07:27.839
I'm not a bad person. I'm not.

07:27.873 --> 07:30.241
-You've been arrested 13 times.
-Okay.

07:30.275 --> 07:32.878
Sure, but...

07:32.911 --> 07:36.448
there's bad and then
there's really bad, right?

07:36.482 --> 07:39.017
I mean...

07:39.050 --> 07:41.520
what did I ever do
except hustle to get high?

07:41.553 --> 07:44.723
Man? I mean, shit, sometimes
you got to throw a brick

07:44.756 --> 07:46.191
through a window

07:46.224 --> 07:48.226
or make some guy think
you're gonna suck his dick

07:48.259 --> 07:50.529
under the highway
and then your pimp shows up

07:50.562 --> 07:52.564
and he's got a rubber revolver,

07:52.598 --> 07:54.533
so the guy's on the ground
and he's begging,

07:54.566 --> 07:57.469
"Please, don't kill me,
I've got a family," or whatever.

07:57.503 --> 08:00.706
Shit. That's just business,
okay? I am not a villain.

08:00.739 --> 08:04.275
Whose body is that?

08:10.716 --> 08:12.651
Can I just...

08:14.252 --> 08:16.221
Can I just please talk to David?

08:16.254 --> 08:18.123
Please?

08:18.156 --> 08:19.958
The end of the world
is coming, Daddy.

08:19.991 --> 08:22.894
We don't got a lot of time.

08:22.928 --> 08:24.129
(bell dings)

08:27.566 --> 08:29.935
Just, please...

08:33.972 --> 08:36.975
("Heroin" by
The Velvet Underground playing)

08:54.960 --> 08:59.497
* I don't know

09:02.033 --> 09:05.003
* Just where I'm going

09:12.844 --> 09:17.082
* But I'm

09:17.115 --> 09:19.918
* Gonna try

09:19.951 --> 09:22.120
* For the kingdom

09:22.153 --> 09:23.755
* If I can

09:23.789 --> 09:27.593
* 'Cause it makes me feel
like I'm a man *

09:27.626 --> 09:31.029
* When I put a spike
into my vein *

09:31.062 --> 09:34.232
* And I tell you things
aren't quite the same *

09:34.265 --> 09:37.368
* When I'm rushing on my run

09:37.402 --> 09:38.804
* And I feel

09:38.837 --> 09:41.372
* Just like Jesus' son

09:41.406 --> 09:44.676
* And I guess that
I just don't know *

09:44.710 --> 09:47.078
* And I guess
that I just don't know. *

09:49.414 --> 09:53.351
Will I have to, um, you know,

09:53.384 --> 09:55.186
touch it?

09:55.220 --> 09:56.688
The body?

09:58.023 --> 09:59.858
Oh, no. Uh, not afraid.

09:59.891 --> 10:03.629
It's... just a new suit.

10:03.662 --> 10:05.363
Cream.

10:05.396 --> 10:08.700
-Cashmere flannel.
-(chuckles)

10:08.734 --> 10:11.069
When you become my age,
you realize

10:11.102 --> 10:15.807
it's not about the thing done.
It's the beauty of the plan.

10:24.582 --> 10:28.887
What is the universe
without each sunrise?

10:28.920 --> 10:31.623
That's how we judge our gods--

10:31.657 --> 10:34.926
not on their math
but their poetry.

10:34.960 --> 10:37.663
I'm just unclear on the
circumstances of the recovery.

10:37.696 --> 10:41.700
Are we talking a mausoleum?
Is it a pine box six feet under?

10:41.733 --> 10:43.534
A golden sarcophagus?

10:43.568 --> 10:46.972
Hmm. There will be earth.

10:50.075 --> 10:51.643
Bugs. Beetles.

10:51.677 --> 10:53.411
Oh...

10:53.444 --> 10:54.680
Bones still sticky.

10:54.713 --> 10:56.014
No.

10:56.047 --> 10:57.649
Some digging required.

10:57.683 --> 11:01.419
But the reward--

11:01.452 --> 11:05.757
a sunrise like you
have never seen.

11:05.791 --> 11:08.026
Unreal.

11:11.096 --> 11:14.565
Nothing's felt real to me
for a very long time.

12:17.662 --> 12:21.733
* When the bats were flying...

12:24.035 --> 12:25.203
Allow me.

12:25.236 --> 12:26.738

12:26.772 --> 12:29.908

PTONOMY:
See, we have these concepts.

14:11.676 --> 14:14.779
The past, the present,
the future.

14:14.812 --> 14:16.814
The past I get.

14:16.848 --> 14:18.850
It's everything
that happened before.

14:18.884 --> 14:22.287
And the future is everything
that's still to come.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.689
But what is the present?

14:27.725 --> 14:28.960
(chuckles)

14:28.994 --> 14:30.661
PTONOMY:
Think about light...

14:30.695 --> 14:33.198
about the speed of light.

14:33.231 --> 14:35.633
Yeah, no matter how close
something is,

14:35.666 --> 14:38.336
it still takes time for
its image to reach your eye.

14:40.271 --> 14:43.508
My glasses, say.

14:43.541 --> 14:47.278
I show them to you,

14:47.312 --> 14:50.315
and it takes time for the image
to reach your eye.

14:51.816 --> 14:53.618
And more time
for that signal to go

14:53.651 --> 14:55.486
from your eye to your brain,

14:55.520 --> 14:57.355
and even more time
for your brain to process

14:57.388 --> 14:59.857
what you're seeing
into information

14:59.891 --> 15:01.359
your body can react to.

15:01.392 --> 15:05.863
Sure, it's millionths
of a second, but still,

15:05.897 --> 15:08.366
it's not now.

15:14.072 --> 15:17.208
So, my theory is...

15:17.242 --> 15:20.078
there is no present.

15:20.111 --> 15:23.381
There's only past and future.

15:26.551 --> 15:30.821
The past and future of what?

15:33.224 --> 15:36.962
Can I...
Can I see those?

15:39.931 --> 15:42.934
It's okay.

15:46.104 --> 15:48.673
You say you remember
everything, right?

15:49.707 --> 15:51.709
Yeah.

15:59.985 --> 16:02.988
What color are my eyes?

16:03.021 --> 16:04.889
Brown.

16:08.093 --> 16:10.328
Wrong.

16:13.564 --> 16:16.667
They were brown...

16:16.701 --> 16:18.069
in your old body.

16:21.973 --> 16:24.075
Whose body is that?

16:24.109 --> 16:27.212
Mm. The body that
you should be worried about

16:27.245 --> 16:29.147
is his.

16:29.180 --> 16:31.749
Because once he gets it,
he's coming after us.

16:31.782 --> 16:34.552
-Us?
-Yes. Us.

16:34.585 --> 16:37.955
I'm with you, baby.

16:37.989 --> 16:41.226
I am.
I'm one of the good guys, okay?

16:41.259 --> 16:45.530
That whole "evil Lenny" thing,
that was...

16:45.563 --> 16:47.698
I was just pretending, I was
just faking it so that he...

16:47.732 --> 16:49.567
And now what are you faking?

16:49.600 --> 16:51.969
Nothing.

16:59.810 --> 17:02.113
Hold still.

17:02.147 --> 17:03.848
This may hurt.

17:13.824 --> 17:16.661
(distorted laughter over TV)

17:26.637 --> 17:28.005
Hold on, something's wrong.

17:28.039 --> 17:29.674
I'm just gonna...

17:32.043 --> 17:33.811
(grunts)

18:01.172 --> 18:03.174
(distorted noise)

18:18.423 --> 18:20.425
(Lenny gasping)

18:26.264 --> 18:28.233
(Ptonomy panting)

18:28.266 --> 18:30.067
Shit.

18:30.101 --> 18:31.969
Buy a girl a drink first.

18:32.002 --> 18:33.971
(both panting)

18:54.525 --> 18:56.694
(whimpering)

18:57.895 --> 19:00.097
(tone sounds)

19:00.131 --> 19:02.600
MAN (over P.A.):
Yellow six alpha.

19:02.633 --> 19:05.170
Orange puma nine.

19:05.203 --> 19:07.138
Seven blue doom.

19:24.255 --> 19:26.257
(wind whooshing)

19:28.426 --> 19:30.761
NARRATOR: Have you ever seen
a shape in a cloud,

19:30.795 --> 19:33.831
or a face in a knot of wood?

19:44.342 --> 19:46.477
...in a piece of toast.

19:52.082 --> 19:53.951
Or does he?

20:05.896 --> 20:07.465
For thousands of years,

20:07.498 --> 20:10.000
our survival depended
on being able

20:10.034 --> 20:12.337
to spot patterns in nature

20:12.370 --> 20:15.206
to find predators hiding
in the wild.

20:15.240 --> 20:16.941
(hisses)

20:18.343 --> 20:20.645
And so now, centuries later,

20:20.678 --> 20:23.013
we are still looking,

20:23.047 --> 20:26.284
still searching every cloud
for faces,

20:26.317 --> 20:29.954
as if our lives depend on it.

20:29.987 --> 20:33.991
So strong is our belief
that a pattern must exist

20:34.024 --> 20:36.361
that the human mind
will project the pieces

20:36.394 --> 20:38.396
that don't fit.

20:41.532 --> 20:43.834
So, where the pessimist
sees danger

20:43.868 --> 20:45.403
hiding behind every back,

20:45.436 --> 20:48.673
the optimist sees friendship.

20:50.808 --> 20:53.644
Which is why,

20:53.678 --> 20:55.513
when we encounter coincidence,

20:55.546 --> 20:59.250
we often see conspiracy.

21:48.366 --> 21:50.100
FAROUK:
Doesn't bother you.

21:52.002 --> 21:53.270
What we do?

21:54.305 --> 21:56.374
Morality?

21:56.407 --> 22:00.244
-Hmm.
-Moral-ity.

22:00.277 --> 22:02.780
Mo-rality.

22:02.813 --> 22:06.216
Oh... right.

22:07.652 --> 22:09.387
The electrons
that make up this car

22:09.420 --> 22:11.288
were part of a star once.

22:11.322 --> 22:14.759
A star that exploded
billions of years ago,

22:14.792 --> 22:18.228
killing any and all life
that may have existed

22:18.262 --> 22:19.864
on hundreds of planets.

22:19.897 --> 22:22.500
Or did it?

22:27.338 --> 22:30.775
My point--
if those atoms still exist,

22:30.808 --> 22:35.746
if they are holding
this car together as we speak,

22:35.780 --> 22:40.284
then perhaps the idea
of life and death...

22:40.317 --> 22:44.054
-is obscene.
-Hmm.

22:44.088 --> 22:49.126
Wait, maybe not obscene,
but irrelevant.

22:55.299 --> 22:57.668
What were we
talking about again?

22:57.702 --> 23:00.237
Morality...

23:00.270 --> 23:02.440
of killing...

23:04.008 --> 23:06.010
Not...

23:08.078 --> 23:10.615
Because you and I,
we are not human.

23:14.552 --> 23:16.120
The lion.

23:16.153 --> 23:19.156
Does a lion ask the morality
of killing a deer,

23:19.189 --> 23:22.427
or a mantis of killing
a hummingbird?

23:22.460 --> 23:25.129
Homo supérieur...

23:26.531 --> 23:28.633
OLIVER (whispering):
Melanie.

23:28.666 --> 23:31.001
*

23:31.035 --> 23:32.870
(birds chirping)

23:36.674 --> 23:39.276
FAROUK:
So, you see...

23:39.309 --> 23:42.880
the morality is not the problem.

23:45.883 --> 23:48.218
I'm going to kill you, you know.

23:48.252 --> 23:50.087
(laughs softly)

23:52.156 --> 23:53.891
(laughs softly)

23:53.924 --> 23:56.360
(engine rumbling nearby)

24:06.070 --> 24:08.072
(car engine starts)

24:19.083 --> 24:21.085
*

24:53.918 --> 24:55.920
(chuckles)

24:57.387 --> 24:59.223
(chuckles)

25:01.959 --> 25:03.594
Finally.

25:06.230 --> 25:08.966
(exhales)

25:08.999 --> 25:11.001
(chuckles)

25:13.437 --> 25:15.840
You know what hit me earlier?

25:18.208 --> 25:20.477
I had no idea...

25:20.511 --> 25:23.714
what silence was...

25:23.748 --> 25:25.716
until Farouk was out of my head.

25:25.750 --> 25:27.184
Real silence.

25:27.217 --> 25:30.087
I can even hear the room.

25:31.622 --> 25:33.624
-Hmm.
-The air moving.

25:34.959 --> 25:37.728
A heartbeat.

25:37.762 --> 25:41.398
What was her name?
Your gran-gran?

25:41.431 --> 25:42.867
Lenore.

25:42.900 --> 25:44.535
Like me.

25:44.569 --> 25:46.604
And if I gave you

25:46.637 --> 25:49.339
a Rondo citrus soda right now...

25:49.373 --> 25:52.643
Just the words
make my tongue sticky.

25:54.478 --> 25:57.447
Did you ever date men?

25:57.481 --> 25:59.984
Yeah, of course.

26:00.017 --> 26:01.619
There was one boy,

26:01.652 --> 26:03.754
in high school.

26:03.788 --> 26:05.756
Jordan Balish.

26:05.790 --> 26:07.592
Lasted a week.

26:07.625 --> 26:09.493
Why?

26:09.526 --> 26:12.029
Because if he was gonna jab
something hard into me,

26:12.062 --> 26:14.464
I sure as shit
was gonna return the favor.

26:14.498 --> 26:16.901
(chuckles)

26:20.871 --> 26:23.173
(whispers):
Twizzler.

26:27.778 --> 26:30.247
You're still working for him.

26:30.280 --> 26:32.316
-The Shadow King.
-Mm-mm.

26:32.349 --> 26:34.551
Lenny, I can read your mind.

26:40.290 --> 26:44.061
Okay, I'm not
not working for him,

26:44.094 --> 26:47.097
but it wasn't my idea, I swear.

26:47.131 --> 26:49.934
I swear.
He put spiders in there.

26:49.967 --> 26:53.337
-Sewed 'em up into my brain.
-Look... here's my problem.

26:53.370 --> 26:56.506
I can't tell the difference
between your ideas and his--

26:56.540 --> 26:59.610
they all look the same-- so
how do I know you're not lying?

26:59.644 --> 27:01.612
Some of my memories...

27:01.646 --> 27:03.748
like...

27:03.781 --> 27:06.083
how I stole my mom's checkbook

27:06.116 --> 27:07.652
and then her
social security number,

27:07.685 --> 27:09.687
and then took out
all these loans in her name

27:09.720 --> 27:11.622
until she...

27:11.656 --> 27:13.390
Did that happen? Her funeral?

27:13.423 --> 27:16.927
Okay. You said you found
his body-- Farouk. Where?

27:16.961 --> 27:18.863
I don't know-- but he found it,

27:18.896 --> 27:20.965
and he sent me here to tell you.

27:20.998 --> 27:22.532
Why?

27:28.138 --> 27:30.274
(exhales)

27:30.307 --> 27:32.409
(long inhale)

27:34.411 --> 27:36.714
(sighs)
There.

27:39.083 --> 27:41.686
He can't reach you now--
I'm protecting you.

27:44.722 --> 27:46.824
It doesn't matter, kid.

27:48.125 --> 27:50.761
I've got no intel.

27:50.795 --> 27:53.063
The sensei kept secrets.

27:53.097 --> 27:54.564
From me and from Oliver.

27:54.598 --> 27:56.300
He kept us
in these little drawers,

27:56.333 --> 27:57.768
you know, like in the morgue,

27:57.802 --> 28:00.137
and then took us out
when he wanted to play.

28:00.170 --> 28:03.741
We only saw what
he wanted us to see.

28:06.744 --> 28:08.946
And why are you really here?

28:12.817 --> 28:14.952
Because I missed you.

28:16.987 --> 28:18.689
Come on.

28:18.723 --> 28:21.291
Clockworks, remember?

28:21.325 --> 28:22.993
David and Lenny?

28:23.027 --> 28:25.730
The good old times?

28:25.763 --> 28:27.131
We were like...

28:27.164 --> 28:28.632
white on rice.

28:28.665 --> 28:29.900
(exhales)

28:29.934 --> 28:32.136
And I know-- he sent me-- but...

28:32.169 --> 28:34.438
can't it be both?

28:35.472 --> 28:37.775
Lenny...

28:37.808 --> 28:40.444
how are you real?

28:42.146 --> 28:44.081
You tell me.

28:44.114 --> 28:46.050
The guy's like a god.

28:46.083 --> 28:49.253
He's a mutant with
psychic powers; he's not a god.

28:49.286 --> 28:50.320
(child's distorted shout)

28:52.723 --> 28:54.191
What?

29:00.798 --> 29:02.900
Whose body is that?

29:03.934 --> 29:05.602
I don't know.

29:05.635 --> 29:08.305
I just...

29:08.338 --> 29:11.308
I told you, I was in my drawer,
and then I just...

29:11.341 --> 29:12.877
woke up.

29:12.910 --> 29:14.378
You woke up?

29:14.411 --> 29:15.980
I'm not lying.

29:16.013 --> 29:18.849
I was in the absent place,
and then I just...

29:20.050 --> 29:22.119
There she was...

29:22.152 --> 29:24.054
in the mirror...

29:24.088 --> 29:26.523
looking back at me.

29:27.557 --> 29:29.593
With blue eyes?

29:29.626 --> 29:31.495
Yeah.

29:31.528 --> 29:33.998
That part's weird.

29:34.031 --> 29:36.233
*

29:57.354 --> 30:00.858
(wind turbine
whooshing rhythmically)

30:04.128 --> 30:06.563
*

30:35.325 --> 30:37.862
What you said before--

30:37.895 --> 30:40.430
that you kill me--

30:40.464 --> 30:42.466
well...

30:42.499 --> 30:46.103
you have been
in the sun too long.

30:48.906 --> 30:51.775
I'm more powerful than you.

30:55.612 --> 30:57.214
Then again...

30:57.247 --> 31:00.584
maybe I've found your weakness.

31:00.617 --> 31:03.553
Oh, my weakness.

31:05.923 --> 31:07.992
You'll see.

31:08.025 --> 31:11.095
But in the moment of attack...

31:11.128 --> 31:13.663
and then it will be too late.

31:13.697 --> 31:15.699
(laughing)

31:16.934 --> 31:18.602
What fun.

31:18.635 --> 31:22.406
(laughing):
What a grand amusement.

31:22.439 --> 31:24.508
Uh, may I...

31:24.541 --> 31:26.576
please have a hint?

31:26.610 --> 31:28.778
-You may.
-Uh-huh?

31:28.812 --> 31:32.983
Your hint is a simple
mathematical question.

31:33.017 --> 31:35.920
What is one...

31:35.953 --> 31:37.621
plus one?

31:37.654 --> 31:39.156
Two.

31:42.526 --> 31:44.261
Incorrect.

31:47.297 --> 31:49.566
Ah, you're very sly.

31:49.599 --> 31:51.001
(chuckles)

31:51.035 --> 31:53.070
A true snake.

31:54.704 --> 31:57.174
Come. Go to work.

31:57.207 --> 31:59.409
*

32:05.082 --> 32:07.784
(indistinct radio chatter
in distance)

32:17.261 --> 32:19.096
Huh.

32:22.499 --> 32:24.534
You're not lying.

32:24.568 --> 32:28.338
You really don't know
how you got here.

32:28.372 --> 32:30.274
I told you.

32:30.307 --> 32:34.078
I just... woke... up.

32:34.111 --> 32:36.780
(shuddering)

32:48.792 --> 32:50.995
(grunting)

33:13.984 --> 33:16.286
I-I don't understand.

33:16.320 --> 33:18.122
Why-why would he
make you real again?

33:18.155 --> 33:20.057
Why send you here?

33:20.090 --> 33:22.059
He has a plan.

33:23.460 --> 33:26.563
That's all I know.
I'm sorry.

33:33.203 --> 33:35.805
AMY (faint, distorted):
* Happy birthday to you

33:35.839 --> 33:38.075
* Happy birthday to you

33:38.108 --> 33:40.144
* Happy birthday, dear David

33:40.177 --> 33:41.778
* Happy birthday to you

33:41.811 --> 33:43.613
* Happy birthday
to you *

33:43.647 --> 33:45.915
* Happy birthday to you

33:45.949 --> 33:47.984
* Happy birthday, dear David

33:48.018 --> 33:50.054
* Happy birthday to you.

33:56.060 --> 33:59.496
(wind turbine
whooshing rhythmically)

34:01.998 --> 34:05.369
(indistinct radio chatter)

34:12.109 --> 34:14.078
-(softly): Hey.
-(kisses)

34:14.111 --> 34:15.679
How was your day?

34:15.712 --> 34:17.747
Eh, acceptable.

34:17.781 --> 34:20.950
Donuts were made and sold.

34:20.984 --> 34:22.986
Miles driven.

34:25.922 --> 34:28.125
I had that dream again.

34:29.526 --> 34:31.928
During the day this time.

34:31.961 --> 34:34.164
What, you took a nap?

34:35.999 --> 34:37.367
What?

34:41.905 --> 34:43.540
Oh.

34:45.242 --> 34:47.211
Yeah.

34:47.244 --> 34:49.479
Took a nap.

34:51.915 --> 34:54.651
(exhales)

34:54.684 --> 34:56.920
Basket.

34:56.953 --> 34:59.923
Was wrong way around.

34:59.956 --> 35:02.259
It was wearing clothes.

35:03.893 --> 35:06.730
In... my dream...

35:06.763 --> 35:09.899
I had a mustache.

35:09.933 --> 35:12.669
-(laughing)
-Charming. Charming.

35:12.702 --> 35:17.141
And when I spoke my voice was...

35:17.174 --> 35:18.542
was music.

35:18.575 --> 35:20.577
What was I saying?

35:23.580 --> 35:27.751
* And now we are this

35:27.784 --> 35:30.820
* The machine that bleeds

35:30.854 --> 35:36.526
* The organizing principle.

35:36.560 --> 35:38.328
So...

35:38.362 --> 35:40.397
(laughs)

35:40.930 --> 35:42.466
Hmm.

35:47.070 --> 35:49.539
Hon?

35:51.508 --> 35:53.643
Probably nothing.

35:53.677 --> 35:56.746
What?

36:02.219 --> 36:04.221
Just...

36:06.423 --> 36:07.924
Do you ever have that feeling

36:07.957 --> 36:11.060
that something bad
is gonna happen?

36:11.094 --> 36:15.232
But also maybe that
it hasn't happened yet?

36:19.236 --> 36:20.970
There's a word for it.

36:21.004 --> 36:22.839
What is it?

36:30.447 --> 36:32.816
Dread.

36:34.284 --> 36:36.052
(turbine stops)

36:36.085 --> 36:38.087
(wind whooshing)

36:59.843 --> 37:03.280
(breathing heavily)

37:13.590 --> 37:17.927
AMY:
Where are the guards?

37:17.961 --> 37:19.963
(doorbell rings)

37:22.499 --> 37:24.268
Stay here.

37:24.301 --> 37:26.703
Ben.

37:41.718 --> 37:43.887
Ben?

37:43.920 --> 37:47.023
Who's there?

37:47.056 --> 37:49.426
(bottle clatters)

37:54.931 --> 37:57.401
(door creaking)

38:27.297 --> 38:29.899
(creaking)

38:49.786 --> 38:52.221
(water running)

39:05.635 --> 39:09.939
* Happy birthday to you

39:09.973 --> 39:14.243
* Happy birthday
to you *

39:14.277 --> 39:19.115
* Happy birthday, dear...

39:20.817 --> 39:23.019
Oliver?

39:29.426 --> 39:33.763
What did they do
with my old body?

39:33.797 --> 39:35.965
The one in the wall?

39:42.439 --> 39:43.940
They buried it.

39:43.973 --> 39:46.443
Where?

39:49.446 --> 39:51.981
In the desert.

39:52.015 --> 39:54.618
(panting)

39:54.651 --> 39:56.219
Maybe.

39:56.252 --> 40:00.189
What?

40:00.223 --> 40:03.192
I'm not sure
Farouk found his body.

40:03.226 --> 40:07.731
I think he found mine.

40:07.764 --> 40:10.366
OLIVER:
Good news. Your brother's back.

40:10.400 --> 40:13.102
David?

40:16.139 --> 40:19.208
OLIVER:
I've come to take you to him.

40:19.242 --> 40:23.112
Great.

40:23.146 --> 40:27.283
I'll just...
I'll go get my coat.

40:37.994 --> 40:39.996
*

40:54.110 --> 40:59.215
* Don't come around here
no more... *

41:00.249 --> 41:02.318
(Amy screaming)

41:02.351 --> 41:06.490
* Don't come around here
no more *

41:10.093 --> 41:15.499
* Whatever you're looking for

41:17.501 --> 41:21.771
* Don't come around here
no more... *

41:21.805 --> 41:24.908
(screaming)

41:24.941 --> 41:28.277
* I've given up

41:32.315 --> 41:35.819
* I've given up

41:40.089 --> 41:43.326
* I've given up

41:43.359 --> 41:48.364
* On waiting any longer

41:48.397 --> 41:50.734
* I've given up

41:50.767 --> 41:53.069
* On this love...

41:53.102 --> 41:54.538
What are you doing?

41:54.571 --> 41:57.473
Finding the sculpture
in the stone.

41:57.507 --> 41:59.909
(screaming)

42:09.586 --> 42:13.557
* I don't feel you any more

42:17.527 --> 42:21.598
* You darken my door

42:24.433 --> 42:29.472
* Whatever you're looking for

42:31.841 --> 42:33.009
* Don't come around here
no more... *

42:33.042 --> 42:34.644
DAVID:
No, no, no!

42:34.678 --> 42:36.145
AMY:
Oh, no!

42:36.179 --> 42:38.147
No!

42:38.181 --> 42:42.586
No! No! (screaming)

42:44.588 --> 42:49.458
* I've given up

42:52.629 --> 42:55.364
* I've given up

42:55.398 --> 42:59.603
* You tangle my emotions

42:59.636 --> 43:02.138
* I've given up

43:02.171 --> 43:05.775
* Honey, please,
admit it's over... *

43:05.809 --> 43:08.211
(screaming)

43:11.047 --> 43:14.217
(gasps)

43:14.250 --> 43:16.653
* Stop, don't

43:18.387 --> 43:21.791
* Stop, don't

43:21.825 --> 43:26.630
* Stop walking down my street

43:27.697 --> 43:29.699

43:36.239 --> 43:40.209

43:40.243 --> 43:44.080
No!

43:44.113 --> 43:45.982
-(crying): Let me out!
-What's happening?

43:47.050 --> 43:50.453
* Stop, don't

43:57.727 --> 43:59.663
* Don't come around here

44:14.610 --> 44:17.446
(crying):
Let me out.

44:17.480 --> 44:19.849
-Hey.
-(crying): No, no, no, no.

44:19.883 --> 44:21.851
It's okay. It's okay.

44:21.885 --> 44:24.654
Shh. It's okay. It's okay.

44:24.688 --> 44:26.656
-YOUNG DAVID: Wait up, Amy.
-(laughter)

44:27.724 --> 44:31.360
* Hey, stop, don't

44:31.394 --> 44:32.696
* Hey

44:32.729 --> 44:34.731
(Farouk laughing)

44:36.733 --> 44:40.536
DAVID:
I'm coming for you.

44:40.569 --> 44:45.174
