WEBVTT

00:03.699 --> 00:04.047
.

00:05.483 --> 00:06.658
- Hey, hope I'm not
interrupting.

00:06.702 --> 00:08.834
- No, come on in.
I'm just researching

00:08.878 --> 00:11.402
Lutheran Kindergarten options
options for the baby.

00:11.446 --> 00:14.188
- Yeah, they fill up fast,

00:14.231 --> 00:16.364
especially
the accredited ones.

00:16.407 --> 00:20.020
- So, I've been doing a little
future planning myself.

00:20.063 --> 00:23.240
And I was thinking that maybe

00:23.284 --> 00:27.505
I might wanna, um,
become a manager like you.

00:30.552 --> 00:31.944
Like me?

00:31.988 --> 00:33.598
- Yeah.

00:33.642 --> 00:37.472
that is some interesting news.

00:37.515 --> 00:40.170
- And I was wondering if maybe
you'd be willing to write

00:40.214 --> 00:41.563
a letter of recommendation

00:41.606 --> 00:44.000
for the management
training program.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.220
I'm sorry, are you okay?

00:46.263 --> 00:47.743
Yeah, I'm sorry.

00:47.786 --> 00:51.660
This is just like
the happiest day of my life.

00:51.703 --> 00:54.706
I am gonna teach you
everything that I know.

00:54.750 --> 00:58.493
You are gonna be
the best manager--sorry--

00:58.536 --> 01:01.322
manage-ess that they have
ever seen.

01:01.365 --> 01:03.063
- I'm pretty sure
that the training program

01:03.106 --> 01:04.542
will cover most of
what I need--

01:04.586 --> 01:06.022
- Oh, there is no way that
I am sending you

01:06.066 --> 01:07.415
into that lion's dean unarmed.

01:07.458 --> 01:09.286
I gotta start building
your curriculum.

01:09.330 --> 01:12.333
- Oh, um, that sounds like
a lot work,

01:12.376 --> 01:14.465
and I know how valuable
your time is.

01:14.509 --> 01:16.946
- No, do not even think about
paying me for this.

01:16.989 --> 01:18.600
Lesson one:

01:18.643 --> 01:22.952
Typing using
the "home row" method.

01:25.998 --> 01:27.870
♪

01:27.913 --> 01:29.741
So, you wanna be a manager.

01:29.785 --> 01:31.830
You've worked
your little tush off.

01:31.874 --> 01:33.745
You're on the fast track.

01:33.789 --> 01:37.053
But sloooow down.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.360
You still got a lot to learn.

01:39.403 --> 01:43.277
Welcome to tape four
of "Management Overview."

01:43.320 --> 01:45.235
- Last night.

01:45.279 --> 01:46.758
He stayed up till 11:30.

01:46.802 --> 01:48.586
He actually fell asleep
through most of part one,

01:48.630 --> 01:50.501
but then he farted himself
awake.

01:50.545 --> 01:52.373
- This is what you get
for wanting to be a manager.

01:52.416 --> 01:54.636
Just a sweaty idiot snoring

01:54.679 --> 01:56.290
and farting through
his basement.

01:57.465 --> 01:58.857
- God, no.
Why would I?

01:58.901 --> 02:00.598
- I just figured since
you're an assistant manager,

02:00.642 --> 02:02.296
the next logical step
would be--

02:02.339 --> 02:03.862
- What's wrong with being
an assistant manager?

02:03.906 --> 02:05.081
- Nothing, nothing.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.039
If you're happy,
I'm not judging you.

02:07.083 --> 02:08.606
- It sounds like
you're judging her.

02:08.650 --> 02:10.521
- Guys, this really doesn't
have to be a group thing.

02:10.565 --> 02:13.307
- I wanna start my own
business someday.

02:13.350 --> 02:15.352
- Oh, my God, so do I.

02:15.396 --> 02:18.747
- Wait, is this
really happening?

02:18.790 --> 02:20.966
Are we really starting
a business together?

02:22.316 --> 02:24.100
I hate you for saying it first,
but yes.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.972
- Guys, remember this moment--
we just witnessed history.

02:27.016 --> 02:29.279
- Sometimes, as a manager,

02:29.323 --> 02:31.673
you've gotta be a shark.

02:34.632 --> 02:37.200
- I think he missed
the pause button.

02:37.244 --> 02:39.637
- I got tricked into starring
in a video once.

02:39.681 --> 02:41.335
It was hilarious.

02:44.686 --> 02:47.297
- ♪ That I got to be
the wild one ♪

02:47.341 --> 02:50.257
♪ Ooh, yeah,
I'm a wild one ♪

02:50.300 --> 02:51.867
♪

02:58.090 --> 02:59.396
- Oh, yeah.

02:59.440 --> 03:01.833
I mean, come on,
who'd have thunk it?

03:01.877 --> 03:05.010
Yesterday you were just
some nobody floor manager,

03:05.054 --> 03:09.624
and now here you are ordering
ice pops all by yourself.

03:09.667 --> 03:11.234
- It's been a whirlwind.
- Yeah.

03:12.714 --> 03:15.195
- Uh-buh-buh-buh!
Euuuhh!

03:16.892 --> 03:21.505
A-C-E-S-T: "Always Check
Everything Seven Times."

03:23.246 --> 03:26.249
Isn't that five or six times
too many?

03:26.293 --> 03:28.164
- You would be surprised
how many mistakes

03:28.208 --> 03:30.297
I pick up on the seventh
check.

03:30.340 --> 03:32.212
- Seven times, got it.

03:32.255 --> 03:33.952
Okay, and then I hit submit.

03:33.996 --> 03:37.260
- Ah--yes, but if you ever
forget where you are,

03:37.304 --> 03:39.131
here's a little
mnemonic device,

03:39.175 --> 03:40.698
you know,
to help you remember.

03:40.742 --> 03:44.136
First ♪ Mark the unit's
inventory price ♪

03:44.180 --> 03:45.573
♪ And unit quantity

03:45.616 --> 03:47.488

03:47.531 --> 03:49.054

you want be ♪

03:49.098 --> 03:50.795
- Glenn, really, I--
- ♪ Then look it over

03:50.839 --> 03:52.580
♪ One more time in case

03:52.623 --> 03:54.277
♪ Then sign it, date it,
click submit ♪

03:54.321 --> 03:55.931
♪ And throw it in the lake

03:55.974 --> 03:58.934
But don't do that last part,
'cause it's just for the rhyme.

03:58.977 --> 04:02.024
- Hey, I've been thinking about
what you said,

04:02.067 --> 04:03.721
about how I should be ashamed
of my job.

04:03.765 --> 04:05.375
- Oh, I didn't actually mean
you should be ashamed--

04:05.419 --> 04:06.985
- No, no, no.
You were right to ridicule me

04:07.029 --> 04:08.291
in front of everyone.

04:08.335 --> 04:10.293
It was harsh
but a real wake-up call.

04:10.337 --> 04:12.121
- Okay, again, I wasn't trying
to ridicule you. I--

04:12.164 --> 04:14.906
- Truth is, I don't wanna do
this for the rest of my life.

04:14.950 --> 04:18.475
But I don't wanna be a manager
either, so...what do I do?

04:18.519 --> 04:21.435
- I mean, you could do
whatever you want.

04:21.478 --> 04:23.480
Could I be a giraffe?

04:23.524 --> 04:25.656
- Well, within reality.
- Yeah, exactly.

04:25.700 --> 04:28.137
How quickly we go from "you can
be whatever you wanna be"

04:28.180 --> 04:30.313
to "within reality."
Okay, drop what you're doing.

04:30.357 --> 04:31.619
We have to figure this out.

04:31.662 --> 04:34.361
- It is the least you can do

04:34.404 --> 04:35.971
after the way you
humiliated me.

04:36.014 --> 04:38.539
You can't just shiv someone
and then walk away.

04:38.582 --> 04:40.454
You need to help mop up
the blood.

04:40.497 --> 04:42.325
Mop up my blood, Jonah.

04:42.369 --> 04:45.415
- What if we call our business
"Divinity"?

04:45.459 --> 04:47.809
But the word Divinity
is written upside down.

04:47.852 --> 04:50.290
- Mmm-hmm, love it, but also
kind of hate it.

04:50.333 --> 04:52.292
What about "Just Us"?

04:55.338 --> 04:57.558
- Just "Just Us."

04:57.601 --> 05:01.605
- "Just Just Us"
or just..."Just Us"?

05:01.649 --> 05:02.954
- Hey, any chance you guys
could go talk

05:02.998 --> 05:04.652
over somebody else's head?
- Shh.

05:04.695 --> 05:06.262
We are trying to create
a lifestyle brand

05:06.306 --> 05:07.785
slash multimedia platform.

05:07.829 --> 05:10.745
- Yeah, you obviously
don't get Chateo.

05:10.788 --> 05:12.268
- Chateo!

05:12.312 --> 05:15.053
I love it!
- I actually thought of it

05:15.097 --> 05:17.099
a while ago, but I was sitting
on it, 'cause I just wanted it

05:17.142 --> 05:18.970
to, like, slip out
and sound super casual.

05:19.014 --> 05:20.450
Oh, my God!

05:20.494 --> 05:22.626
- Okay, so the guy that
we're going to talk to

05:22.670 --> 05:24.759
at the distribution center
is named Ronald Stimple.

05:24.802 --> 05:26.630
And here's a few tidbits
I collected

05:26.674 --> 05:28.153
to help us out
during the call.

05:28.197 --> 05:30.417
- We need to know that he wears
a mouth guard at night

05:30.460 --> 05:32.419
to order paper towels?
- Okay, Amy,

05:32.462 --> 05:35.291
managing a store
is about relationships.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.945
Business is personal.

05:36.988 --> 05:39.164
That's why when you ask
a question that's too personal,

05:39.208 --> 05:41.341
they say "it's none of your..."

05:41.384 --> 05:43.299
- "Business."
- Exactly.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.953
God, you're a fast learner.

05:44.996 --> 05:47.172
- Would you mind
actually putting that

05:47.216 --> 05:48.696
in the recommendation letter?

05:48.739 --> 05:51.263
Which, by the way, they said
"the sooner the better,"

05:51.307 --> 05:52.352
but no pressure.

05:52.395 --> 05:53.614
- Yeah, I'm not feeling any.

05:53.657 --> 05:56.573
Okay, so, Ronald
is 47 years old,

05:56.617 --> 05:58.749
he's in a handball league,
he had a deaf girlfriend

05:58.793 --> 06:02.405
when he was 16, and he's
thinking about a vasectomy,

06:02.449 --> 06:04.407
but I think he's showing off.

06:04.451 --> 06:05.669
- Shipping.

06:05.713 --> 06:07.410
- Hey, Ronald, Glenn Sturgis
here.

06:07.454 --> 06:09.412
Time to order some more
paper towels.

06:09.456 --> 06:10.761
- Okay, no problem.

06:10.805 --> 06:12.197
- Okay, anyway,
how's it going with--

06:13.547 --> 06:15.200
And that is how that is done.

06:15.244 --> 06:16.680
- So interesting...
- Yeah.

06:16.724 --> 06:18.639
- To see behind the curtains.
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

06:18.682 --> 06:20.858
All right, next up
is Fern Rosato.

06:20.902 --> 06:22.860
Now,
she's married to a woman,

06:22.904 --> 06:25.080
so watch how casually
I bring up

06:25.123 --> 06:26.995
"Xena: Warrior Princess."

06:32.696 --> 06:32.870
.

06:32.914 --> 06:34.176
- Ah!

06:35.830 --> 06:38.615
I'm supposed to be tuning into
the rhythms of the store.

06:38.659 --> 06:41.966
Or trusting my inner manager.
I'm not sure.

06:42.010 --> 06:43.446
Glenn was playing
"Chariots of Fire"

06:43.490 --> 06:44.795
really loudly at the time.

06:44.839 --> 06:45.883
- Sounds like
you're learning a lot.

06:45.927 --> 06:47.407
- Oh, yeah.
Earlier today,

06:47.450 --> 06:49.365
I got to order
ice pops all by myself.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.846
- Nice! Sounds like
it's totally worth it.

06:51.889 --> 06:53.674
- Well, I think in the end
it will be.

06:53.717 --> 06:55.066
I'm just glad to finally be

06:55.110 --> 06:56.894
taking control of my life
again, you know?

06:56.938 --> 06:59.723
No more crying over
stupid mistakes I made

06:59.767 --> 07:01.116
as a high school student.

07:01.159 --> 07:02.944
If I'm unhappy with my life,
then you know,

07:02.987 --> 07:04.293
it's up to me to change that.

07:04.336 --> 07:06.513
- For me, I think it started
with my parents.

07:06.556 --> 07:09.559
They didn't love each other
enough to love their kids.

07:09.603 --> 07:11.866
- Oh, um, I...

07:11.909 --> 07:13.215
Oh.

07:16.958 --> 07:18.481
- Okay, next question.

07:18.525 --> 07:19.700
"In your career,
would you rather work

07:19.743 --> 07:20.962
with your hands
or at a desk?"

07:21.005 --> 07:22.398
- Well, if I choose the desk,

07:22.442 --> 07:23.530
am I not allowed to use
my hands?

07:23.573 --> 07:25.096
I mean, am I typing
with my face?

07:25.140 --> 07:27.098
- I think you're getting
bogged down with the details.

07:27.142 --> 07:29.884
Just answer off the top
of your head.

07:29.927 --> 07:33.409
- Pfff. I mean, I don't--
I don't know, it depends.

07:33.453 --> 07:36.151
I mean, "work with your hands"
could be code for "massage,"

07:36.194 --> 07:37.805
which could be code
for "prostitution."

07:37.848 --> 07:39.067
I mean, do I wanna be
a prostitute?

07:39.110 --> 07:41.461
Again, depends.
Who are my clients?

07:41.504 --> 07:43.724
- Let's try a different
section.

07:43.767 --> 07:45.247
Um, okay.

07:45.290 --> 07:47.162
"Rank the following
four qualities

07:47.205 --> 07:49.294
"from most to least important:
flexible hours,

07:49.338 --> 07:53.081
coworker relationships,
social impact, salary."

07:53.124 --> 07:54.299
- Four-way tie.

07:56.737 --> 07:58.260
- That's...okay.

07:58.303 --> 07:59.914
- Yeah.
- I'll just--all right.

07:59.957 --> 08:02.525
- Okay, uh, what about
this one?

08:02.569 --> 08:03.961
How does it make you feel?

08:04.005 --> 08:05.441
- Scared.

08:06.355 --> 08:07.922
- Interesting.
You said the last one

08:07.965 --> 08:10.098
also made you feel scared.

08:10.141 --> 08:11.621
- Yeah.

08:11.665 --> 08:13.623
- Okay.

08:13.667 --> 08:15.146
- Hey, is that
the Pizza Hut font?

08:15.190 --> 08:17.540
- Yes. Just how does it
make you feel?

08:17.584 --> 08:20.761
- Like, um...hungry.

08:20.804 --> 08:24.460
- No. We want sophisticated,
bold,

08:24.504 --> 08:26.288
offensive, inclusive.

08:26.331 --> 08:28.116
.
I'm sorry,

08:28.159 --> 08:29.900
I thought that we weren't
doing "bold."

08:29.944 --> 08:32.120
- I thought we were
doing "bold."

08:32.163 --> 08:34.122
Okay, maybe we should just
forget the whole thing.

08:34.165 --> 08:35.776
Okay, I'm out.

08:35.819 --> 08:39.649
What if instead of "bold"
we did "extreme"?

08:40.520 --> 08:42.304
- Okay, okay, back in.

08:42.347 --> 08:44.001
I love "extreme."

08:44.045 --> 08:47.265
We just solved our first
business crisis.

08:47.309 --> 08:50.094
- I love making business
decisions.

08:50.138 --> 08:53.445
- Okay, I have hidden
several rule violations

08:53.489 --> 08:55.360
somewhere in this section.

08:55.404 --> 08:56.797
And, go.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.407
- That trash can
is overflowing.

08:58.450 --> 09:00.540
That fluorescent light bulb
is out.

09:00.583 --> 09:02.106
That mannequin's
missing an arm.

09:02.150 --> 09:03.934
There is a bottle
of grape soda

09:03.978 --> 09:05.414
that doesn't belong in
women's wear and it's leaking.

09:05.457 --> 09:07.155
These sweaters
aren't really folded.

09:07.198 --> 09:08.591
They're just sort of wadded up
into balls.

09:08.635 --> 09:11.115
And Brett should be wearing
a shirt.

09:12.856 --> 09:14.118
- That was really good.

09:14.162 --> 09:16.033
You even found some
I didn't notice.

09:16.077 --> 09:19.471
Okay, so, this next part
is called:

09:19.515 --> 09:21.169
"Backwards
and on Roller-Skates."

09:21.212 --> 09:23.519
'Cause a great manager
should be able to do this job

09:23.563 --> 09:26.348
backwards and on roller-skates.

09:26.391 --> 09:29.307
- Glenn, this really isn't
necessary.

09:29.351 --> 09:31.266
I mean, I know
all of this stuff,

09:31.309 --> 09:32.833
and what I don't know,
I'm sure I'll learn

09:32.876 --> 09:34.835
in actual management
training.

09:34.878 --> 09:39.579
- So, you don't want my fake
management training,

09:39.622 --> 09:41.189
is what you're saying.

09:41.232 --> 09:43.365
- I mean, I wanna say
exactly,

09:43.408 --> 09:46.673
but I'm trying not to hurt
your feelings.

09:46.716 --> 09:48.849
- Sorry I wasted your time.

09:52.026 --> 09:54.289
- Brett, for future reference,
if a manager asks you

09:54.332 --> 09:56.857
to take off your clothes,
you can say no.

09:58.380 --> 10:01.122
- Okay, what about
Professional flavor tester?

10:01.165 --> 10:03.559
- Pass. I don't want
my sister's job.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.346
- Enforcement.
- Pass.

10:08.390 --> 10:10.044
- Also, pass.

10:10.087 --> 10:11.567
- Why didn't you just say that
to being with?

10:11.611 --> 10:12.829
- I'm trying to be open.

10:12.873 --> 10:14.396
- Maybe you could be
a bike messenger.

10:14.439 --> 10:17.181
- Uh, like Joseph Gordon-Levitt
in "Premium Rush"?

10:17.225 --> 10:19.444
I think I'll pass on being
chased around by a corrupt cop

10:19.488 --> 10:21.533
because I'm unknowingly
delivering $50,000

10:21.577 --> 10:23.884
to a Chinese human trafficker,
thanks.

10:23.927 --> 10:25.276
- What are you trying to do,
get her killed?

10:25.320 --> 10:27.235
Is that a job?

10:27.278 --> 10:29.846
- I don't think
I see that listed here.

10:29.890 --> 10:31.935
- It's a pass anyway.
- Ah.

10:31.979 --> 10:33.676
- Too worried about the bends.

10:33.720 --> 10:36.853
- Amy, hey.

10:36.897 --> 10:38.159
Are you the one
who keeps putting

10:38.202 --> 10:39.856
pictures of naked horses
in my locker?

10:41.684 --> 10:43.164
- Not this naked.

10:43.207 --> 10:45.993
They're just...putting it all
out there.

10:46.036 --> 10:47.647
- No, Marcus, no.

10:47.690 --> 10:50.432
I am not the one putting
naked horses in your locker.

10:50.475 --> 10:52.826
- Okay.

10:52.869 --> 10:55.480
Also, did you septuple-check
this purchase order?

10:55.524 --> 10:57.091
It just showed up.

10:57.134 --> 11:00.572
- No, because you don't need to
check something seven times.

11:00.616 --> 11:02.139
That is not right.

11:02.183 --> 11:05.795
Obviously, it was a typo.
I meant to write 120.

11:05.839 --> 11:08.668
Who would need 12,000 boxes
of ice pops?

11:08.711 --> 11:10.104
We don't have room for that.

11:10.147 --> 11:12.584
No, sorry, sir.
Can you not bring this in?

11:12.628 --> 11:14.021
- Sorry, lady, not my problem.

11:14.064 --> 11:15.805
- You cannot hold us
to this deal.

11:16.676 --> 11:19.635
No, okay, sir, you may not
bring this in here.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.289
Absolutely not.
All right, fine.

11:21.332 --> 11:24.727
You are not going anywhere.

11:24.771 --> 11:26.033
Oh, God.

11:26.076 --> 11:27.512
Okay, these shoes
have no traction.

11:30.646 --> 11:31.038
.

11:31.081 --> 11:33.127
- This is way too many
ice pops.

11:33.170 --> 11:34.650
- It's fine.
It's fine.

11:34.694 --> 11:37.827
We just have to sell them
as quickly as possible.

11:37.871 --> 11:39.873
Now, in the middle of winter.

11:39.916 --> 11:42.353
- Yeah, it's like when you were
playing in the snow as a kid,

11:42.397 --> 11:44.181
and your mom would come out
with a delicious tray

11:44.225 --> 11:46.401
of ice-cold milkshakes.

11:46.444 --> 11:48.490
- Um, does Glenn know
about this?

11:48.533 --> 11:51.841
- No, and he doesn't need to,
so let's get all these

11:51.885 --> 11:53.669
into the freezer
before he sees them.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.018
- The freezer's full.

11:55.062 --> 11:56.237
And based on my experience
with ice,

11:56.280 --> 11:57.760
these things are gonna melt.

11:57.804 --> 11:59.370
- Well, it's January, Marcus.

11:59.414 --> 12:02.199
Outside is a freezer, so just
hide them somewhere outside.

12:02.243 --> 12:04.027
- You want me to just hide

12:04.071 --> 12:06.203
all of these boxes
somewhere outside?

12:06.247 --> 12:08.205
- Absolutely.

12:08.249 --> 12:09.729
I'm pretty good
at hiding things.

12:09.772 --> 12:11.295
My girlfriend lived with me
for an entire year

12:11.339 --> 12:13.384
during high school.
My mom had no idea.

12:13.428 --> 12:15.299
I hid her in my stuffed animals
like E.T..

12:15.343 --> 12:17.171
- Why did you have so many
stuffed animals in high school?

12:17.214 --> 12:18.650
- Do we need someone
to distract Glenn

12:18.694 --> 12:19.956
while we try to sell them?

12:20.000 --> 12:22.785
I can make myself
cry on command. Watch.

12:22.829 --> 12:24.656
Ooh, it's not happening.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.571
Oh wait, here it comes.

12:26.615 --> 12:29.749
Okay, everyone look away.
I'm gonna pull out a nose hair.

12:29.792 --> 12:31.011
- Ugh!

12:31.054 --> 12:32.055
Cheyenne and I will
distract him.

12:32.099 --> 12:33.404
- Okay, yeah, great.

12:33.448 --> 12:35.276
That's a plan.
We have a plan.

12:35.319 --> 12:38.235
- Yeah, Marcus is just gonna
hide these boxes somewhere.

12:38.279 --> 12:41.238
Mateo and Cheyenne are gonna
distract Glenn with something.

12:41.282 --> 12:42.892
And Justine's gonna cry.

12:42.936 --> 12:45.590
This is some "Tinker Tailor
Soldier Spy" level .

12:45.634 --> 12:46.809
- Yeah.

12:46.853 --> 12:48.811
- It's pretty good.

12:51.858 --> 12:58.038
♪

12:58.908 --> 12:59.996
- Hey, Glenn.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.215
I don't know if you heard,

13:01.258 --> 13:03.783
but Mateo and I are starting
a business.

13:03.826 --> 13:05.262
- "Chateo."

13:05.306 --> 13:07.264
- Oh, that's really great.

13:07.308 --> 13:09.527
- Well, and since
you're a businessman,

13:09.571 --> 13:12.792
we were wondering if we could
sit here with you

13:12.835 --> 13:16.796
for the next...couple of hours,

13:16.839 --> 13:18.449
and just really learn from you.

13:18.493 --> 13:20.364
- Really,
you want my help?

13:20.408 --> 13:21.931
- Oh, yes.
- Uh, yes.

13:21.975 --> 13:23.846
- Please.
- Absolutely.

13:23.890 --> 13:25.543
- Okay, have a seat.

13:26.631 --> 13:29.721
- Ugh, I thought I was starting
to find Coat Guard interesting,

13:29.765 --> 13:32.942
but I think I'm just enjoying
this octopus in a sailor hat.

13:32.986 --> 13:35.684
- Well, I think we've been
through every job,

13:35.727 --> 13:36.990
and there's nothing left.

13:37.033 --> 13:38.600
- There's gotta be something.

13:38.643 --> 13:40.471
Do you think space mailman
will ever be a thing?

13:40.515 --> 13:42.125
- Look, you can't expect
to figure out

13:42.169 --> 13:43.344
your entire future in a day.

13:43.387 --> 13:45.955
I spent 200 grand
on higher education,

13:45.999 --> 13:47.217
and I still haven't
figured it out.

13:47.261 --> 13:49.872
Your parents must be pissed.

13:49.916 --> 13:51.395
- Nope. All student loans.

13:51.439 --> 13:54.398
- You have $200,000
in student loan debt?

13:54.442 --> 13:56.531
Ha! I mean, the interest
on that alone

13:56.574 --> 13:58.315
must be more than
you make here.

13:58.359 --> 14:01.144
- Well, yeah.
I mean, sure...

14:01.188 --> 14:02.450
- That means every single day,

14:02.493 --> 14:04.147
even after you've worked
a full day,

14:04.191 --> 14:06.062
you are more in debt than
you were the day before.

14:06.106 --> 14:07.368
- Uh-huh.

14:07.411 --> 14:09.239
- Wow, I thought I was
in trouble,

14:09.283 --> 14:11.502
but...ha! I mean,
you're just as lost as I am,

14:11.546 --> 14:13.374
andyou're 2 hundy
in the hole.

14:13.417 --> 14:14.897
That's pretty weird
to think about, huh?

14:16.812 --> 14:18.988
- That is weird.

14:19.032 --> 14:20.511
- Attention shoppers:

14:20.555 --> 14:22.165
it's 10 degrees Fahrenheit
outside,

14:22.209 --> 14:25.255
so why not take home
a frosty case of ice pops?

14:25.299 --> 14:26.561
It makes about as much sense

14:26.604 --> 14:28.302
as most of the stuff
you buy here.

14:28.345 --> 14:30.739
I'm looking at you,
Spoon Painting Guy.

14:33.220 --> 14:36.179
- Sir, would you like to try
a tasty ice pop?

14:36.223 --> 14:38.181
Ma'am, you look like
you could use

14:38.225 --> 14:39.704
a refreshing pick-me-up.

14:39.748 --> 14:44.057
Celebrate winter with yummy,
ice-cold ice pops.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.842
- Are these okay
for a diabetic?

14:46.886 --> 14:48.626
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

14:48.670 --> 14:49.758
Thanks.

14:49.801 --> 14:51.542
- And just like that,

14:51.586 --> 14:55.111
you have a mug of steaming hot
purple cider.

14:55.155 --> 14:58.419
Get your ice pops,
ice pops, ice pops.

14:58.462 --> 14:59.376
Hey, oh.

14:59.420 --> 15:01.335
Look alive, look alive.

15:01.378 --> 15:03.685
Half a cup of milk,
a handful of kale,

15:03.728 --> 15:07.907
a scoop of protein powder,
add three ice pops,

15:09.996 --> 15:11.823
That's what fiber sounds like.

15:11.867 --> 15:15.915
Have a heavenly day.
Have a heavenly day.

15:15.958 --> 15:19.222
And then...voila.

15:20.963 --> 15:22.225
Mmm.

15:22.269 --> 15:24.662
If your daddy says
you can't have them,

15:24.706 --> 15:28.579
then you scream and scream
and scream your head off

15:28.623 --> 15:30.103
until he says yes.

15:30.146 --> 15:32.975
Just a little like--
it's like popcorn.

15:33.019 --> 15:36.152
- They said it couldn't be
done, but just like that,

15:36.196 --> 15:39.677
12,000 ice pops disappeared.

15:42.767 --> 15:44.465
Mindfreak, right?

15:44.508 --> 15:46.423
- I think this is one
of those situations where

15:46.467 --> 15:49.252
the job you did
is so incredibly bad

15:49.296 --> 15:53.082
and such a massive
waste of time

15:53.126 --> 15:55.955
that it circled around
to genius.

15:58.261 --> 15:59.610

Whoa!

17:12.683 --> 17:14.120
- Okay.

17:15.251 --> 17:19.342
- Uh, I am just, uh, stunned

17:19.386 --> 17:23.216
by how nice our parking lot is.

17:23.259 --> 17:26.741
Well done.
Very well done.

17:26.784 --> 17:30.049
- It is.
It is a nice parking lot.

17:30.092 --> 17:31.833
all: Oh!

17:31.876 --> 17:33.095
- Oh...oh...

17:33.139 --> 17:35.706
oh...oh!

17:35.750 --> 17:38.361
- You're not supposed to cut
through like that.

17:41.451 --> 17:41.625

17:41.669 --> 17:43.671
- Do you think Glenn
was really mad?

17:43.714 --> 17:45.020
I mean, it's hard to tell
with him.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.587
He turns purple
for so many reasons.

17:46.630 --> 17:47.762
- Mm-hmm.

17:47.805 --> 17:49.068
Hey, this might not be
the best time,

17:49.111 --> 17:50.417
but I need to get reimbursed

17:50.460 --> 17:51.853
for the giant photo
of the parking lot.

17:51.896 --> 17:54.029
Kinda maxed out
my mom's credit card.

17:54.073 --> 17:57.511
- Uh...no.

17:59.991 --> 18:02.124
- But you said
"hide the ice pops."

18:02.168 --> 18:05.649
I did exactly what you said.

18:05.693 --> 18:08.957

of these feel right to you.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.133
First up, me as a chef.

18:11.177 --> 18:13.179
- Yummers.

- I did.

18:18.706 --> 18:20.882
- You have to say "9-1-1."
- Okay.

18:20.925 --> 18:23.406
- Okay. Astronaut.

18:23.450 --> 18:26.322
- Come on, she obviously
just made a mistake.

18:26.366 --> 18:27.976
- We don't take returns.
You know that.

18:28.019 --> 18:30.631
- Well, maybe you could
just take half of them back,

18:30.674 --> 18:32.589
and then in future purchases--

18:32.633 --> 18:34.591
- Amy, I got this.

18:34.635 --> 18:37.986
Come on, Donovan, like,
we--we know each other.

18:38.029 --> 18:40.075
We've worked together
for years.

18:41.511 --> 18:43.034
- Like, I know that you
tore your meniscus

18:43.078 --> 18:44.384
playing handball, remember?

18:44.427 --> 18:47.126
And you've got a bulldog
named Velvet.

18:47.169 --> 18:49.693
- There's nothing I can do.

18:50.694 --> 18:52.566
- I also know about
the waitress.

18:52.609 --> 18:54.002
- Yeah.

18:54.045 --> 18:55.873
On April 7th,
you told me that your wife

18:55.917 --> 18:57.397
was going out of town
for a month.

18:57.440 --> 18:59.181
But then on April 21st,
you told me

18:59.225 --> 19:00.574
that you'd "pounded a waitress

19:00.617 --> 19:03.054
until her eyes
rolled back in her head."

19:03.098 --> 19:04.708
I didn't wanna hear about it
at the time,

19:04.752 --> 19:07.015
but now I'm glad I did.

19:10.540 --> 19:11.585
I'll take them back.

19:11.628 --> 19:13.674
- That is wonderful!

19:13.717 --> 19:16.329
See, I knew we could come
to an understanding, Donovan.

19:16.372 --> 19:17.634
Thanks for stopping by.

19:17.678 --> 19:20.246
yourself,
Glenn.

19:20.289 --> 19:22.378
- Again, I'm sorry about
the typo.

19:22.422 --> 19:24.641
I didn't know
it would get so dark.

19:24.685 --> 19:26.687
- I feel like everyone
works Monday to Friday,

19:26.730 --> 19:29.080
so we should do Tuesday,
Thursday, Sunday

19:29.124 --> 19:30.299
from 10:00 pm to 2:00 am.

19:30.343 --> 19:31.822
- Smart.

19:31.866 --> 19:33.346
Then we could do lots
of business with Tokyo.

19:33.389 --> 19:34.434
- Yes.

19:34.477 --> 19:36.610
- Hey,
if you guys are serious

19:36.653 --> 19:38.568
about starting a business,
would it be crazy

19:38.612 --> 19:40.309
if we teamed up?

19:40.353 --> 19:41.919
- Yeah, yeah.

19:41.963 --> 19:44.052
I mean, I went to
business school.

19:44.095 --> 19:45.836
It was only a year,
but you know, it's something.

19:45.880 --> 19:47.621
And I have a lot
of great ideas.

19:47.664 --> 19:48.883
Hey, you know what?
How 'bout this?

19:48.926 --> 19:50.711
The next day
that we all have off,

19:50.754 --> 19:52.887
let's get together and just
brainstorm some business ideas.

19:52.930 --> 19:54.367
Maybe we could do
some research--

19:54.410 --> 19:56.107
- I'm gonna cut you off
right there.

19:56.151 --> 19:58.545
You know we're not actually
gonna start a business, right?

19:59.937 --> 20:01.374
- No, I mean, we always
tell ourselves

20:01.417 --> 20:02.766
that we're gonna do
something,

20:02.810 --> 20:04.246
but I think in the back
of our heads,

20:04.290 --> 20:06.161
we both know we're never
actually gonna do it.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.902
Right?
- God, no.

20:07.945 --> 20:09.382
- Ah--oh, okay.

20:09.425 --> 20:11.688
- It's like when people
talk about starting a band.

20:11.732 --> 20:14.038
- Oh, my God, we should
start a band.

20:14.082 --> 20:15.736
- Yes!

20:15.779 --> 20:17.781
- I don't play
any instruments.

20:17.825 --> 20:19.914
- Again, we're not actually
gonna do this.

20:19.957 --> 20:22.569
- Oh, right--yes.
So then, yeah, sure.

20:24.048 --> 20:25.572
- You know, I always thought
a good name for a band

20:25.615 --> 20:28.183
would be the Hardtime Ramblers.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.663
- All in favor...
- Ugh!

20:29.706 --> 20:31.534
- Of voting Jonah
out of the band?

20:31.578 --> 20:35.451
- Glenn, I'm really sorry
I messed up the order.

20:40.978 --> 20:42.589
What is this?

20:42.632 --> 20:45.287
- My recommendation
for the program.

20:45.331 --> 20:46.767
- Mm-hmm.

20:46.810 --> 20:48.682
- Mm-hmm.

20:48.725 --> 20:50.858
- Glenn, thank you.

20:50.901 --> 20:53.339
- You know, I made a mistake
or two coming up.

20:53.382 --> 20:54.775
- Mm-hmm.

20:54.818 --> 20:56.167
- Oh, yeah.

20:56.211 --> 20:57.299
- Yeah.

20:57.343 --> 20:58.518
- Oh.

20:58.561 --> 21:00.781
- On time, I gave $100
in change

21:00.824 --> 21:02.957
when it was only
supposed to be 35 cents.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.132
- Oh.

21:04.175 --> 21:05.438
- And then another time,

21:05.481 --> 21:08.179
I forgot to put anybody
on the schedule,

21:08.223 --> 21:11.095
and I had to work the whole day
alone in the store.

21:11.139 --> 21:12.140
- Hmm.

21:12.183 --> 21:13.794
- And then, uh,
and then one time

21:13.837 --> 21:15.926
I ate everybody's lunch
by accident.

21:15.970 --> 21:20.366
And, um--oh, I accidentally
ordered some adult toys

21:20.409 --> 21:21.758
'cause I thought
they were puzzles.
