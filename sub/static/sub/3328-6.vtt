WEBVTT

00:04.800 --> 00:06.768
HOLMES:
I present to you

00:06.800 --> 00:11.066
the human condition in
all its sordid glory.

00:11.110 --> 00:13.237
It's a bunch
of guys in a cell.

00:15.280 --> 00:17.703
We_ have _a ﬁnite numlper
of Friday nights In our lives.

00:17.750 --> 00:19.411
Why are we spending
one of them here?

00:19.450 --> 00:21.145
Because it's
Friday night.

00:21.180 --> 00:23.045
This is when the holding cells
are at their busiest.

00:23.090 --> 00:24.489
You have before you

00:24.520 --> 00:25.782
a gilded opportunity

00:25.820 --> 00:28.152
to sharpen your
deductive prowess.

00:28.190 --> 00:29.259
Each one of these men,

00:29.290 --> 00:30.780
whether they
realize it or not,

00:30.830 --> 00:33.458
is telling you the story
of how he came to be here.

00:33.500 --> 00:35.127
It's written in their_
bearing, on their clothing.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.424
So, look at the guy
and then tell you what they did.

00:37.470 --> 00:39.131
There's like 20 people
in here.

00:39.170 --> 00:41.058
You find that
intimidating?

00:41.100 --> 00:43.159
Plaid shirt,
very nervous,

00:43.210 --> 00:44.802
obviously never been
in jail before.

00:44.840 --> 00:46.831
Keeps fiddling with
his wedding ring,

00:46.880 --> 00:47.733
feeling guilty
about something,

00:47.780 --> 00:50.669
probably the hooker
he picked up earlier.

00:50.710 --> 00:51.802
Popped collar--

00:51.850 --> 00:53.215
drunk and
disorderly.

00:53.250 --> 00:54.069
That one's a layup.

00:54.120 --> 00:56.486
Tattoo guy is, uh...

00:58.350 --> 01:00.079
Would you like a hint?
No.

01:00.120 --> 01:02.179
His crime involves a litter
of purebred Yorkshire terriers.

01:02.230 --> 01:04.255
I said I don't want
a hint.

01:06.230 --> 01:07.356
This could take
a while.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.594
I'm gonna get
a coffee.

01:08.630 --> 01:10.393
Do you want?
No.

01:12.400 --> 01:14.197
MAN:
Hey.

01:14.240 --> 01:15.537
Can you do me next?

01:19.280 --> 01:21.134
Got to warn you,
if you hit "latte,"

01:21.180 --> 01:22.204
you're not going to recognize
what comes out.

01:22.250 --> 01:24.707
(laughs)
I just got a coffee, thanks.

01:24.750 --> 01:26.570
I'm Craig Basken.
I work a lot of nights.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.440
Oh. Joan Watson.

01:28.480 --> 01:31.187
You're one of the, uh,
the consultants, right?

01:31.220 --> 01:33.757
Yeah.
You work, uh, with the
guy with the socks.

01:33.790 --> 01:35.212
(laughs)

01:35.260 --> 01:38.423
Listen, um, I know you
guys work the stuff

01:38.460 --> 01:40.348
that Captain Gregson
calls you in on,

01:40.400 --> 01:42.891
but I caught this string of
robberies in the West Village.

01:42.930 --> 01:45.569
Uh, someone's knocking
over falafel carts,

01:45.600 --> 01:47.363
and it's not the
crime of the century

01:47.400 --> 01:49.209
and it shouldn't be
that hard to clear.

01:49.240 --> 01:50.207
But you're stuck.

01:50.240 --> 01:52.299
Yeah, so...

01:52.340 --> 01:56.572
I thought maybe I'd,
uh, I'd hit you up,

01:56.610 --> 01:57.872
get another
perspective.

01:57.910 --> 01:59.275
I hope that's not
too much to ask.

01:59.320 --> 02:00.241
No, no, it's not
a problem.

02:00.280 --> 02:02.180
Sherlock and I would be
happy to take a look.

02:02.220 --> 02:04.279
I said hi to that
guy once, and, uh,

02:04.320 --> 02:07.517
h-he said that I interrupted
his train of thought.

02:07.560 --> 02:10.358
He, uh, called
me a bell-end,

02:10.390 --> 02:15.191
so I was thinking maybe you
could have a look-- just you.

02:15.230 --> 02:18.222
Um, sure, yeah.

02:18.270 --> 02:19.635
Great.

02:19.670 --> 02:20.739
I'll just, uh, grab
the case file.

02:20.770 --> 02:23.603
Okay.

02:25.610 --> 02:28.408
Hi, honey.

02:28.440 --> 02:30.169
It's your mom.

02:30.210 --> 02:32.314
I'm calling again.

02:32.350 --> 02:34.170
Just wondering
if you're gonna call me back

02:34.220 --> 02:35.642
before the end of the semester.

02:35.680 --> 02:37.511
I hope you're having
a great time.

02:37.550 --> 02:38.881
I love you.

02:38.920 --> 02:41.388
Where is your husband?
(gasps, drops phone)

02:43.560 --> 02:46.358
Where is your husband?

02:46.400 --> 02:49.892
My, my husband--
I, I don't know.

02:49.930 --> 02:51.761
Where is he?

02:54.300 --> 02:55.460
(alarm blaring)

03:05.880 --> 03:07.871
(banging)

03:16.960 --> 03:18.222
(thumping)

03:20.700 --> 03:22.668
(door closes)

03:22.700 --> 03:24.361
OPERATOR:
911. What's your emergency?

03:24.400 --> 03:26.265
Yes, a man broke into my house.

03:26.300 --> 03:27.665
He was armed.

03:28.700 --> 03:31.931
I shot him. There's blood.

03:31.970 --> 03:33.232
Is he still there, ma'am?

03:33.280 --> 03:35.305
Are you safe?

03:35.340 --> 03:37.808
I think he's gone.

03:37.850 --> 03:39.670
Okay, he said that he came
for my husband.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.676
You have to make sure
that he's okay.

03:41.720 --> 03:43.847
Where is your husband now?

03:43.890 --> 03:45.778
He's working, I think.

03:45.820 --> 03:47.310
He's with the 11th Precinct.

03:47.360 --> 03:48.679
Your husband's a police officer?

03:48.720 --> 03:50.426
He's the captain there.

03:50.460 --> 03:52.451
His name's Tommy Gregson.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.882
(indistinct radio transmission)

04:18.050 --> 04:19.984
She's back in
the kitchen, Captain.

04:24.760 --> 04:26.751
You're okay.

04:29.370 --> 04:30.894
Are you okay?

04:30.930 --> 04:35.299
Yeah. Yeah.

04:35.340 --> 04:37.706
I was working out in the garage
when I heard the gun go off.

04:37.740 --> 04:38.900
All right, I'm gonna
need you to walk me

04:38.940 --> 04:40.669
through everything
you remember.

04:40.710 --> 04:42.507
Is the captain all right?
Holmes, yeah, he's fine.

04:42.550 --> 04:44.745
He's inside with his_ wife.
I'm givmg 'em a minute.

04:44.780 --> 04:47.510
Hey, I said I'm giving
'em a minute.
All right.

04:47.550 --> 04:48.744
This is Jim Monroe-- he
lives across the street,

04:48.780 --> 04:51.010
got a quick look
at our guy.

04:51.050 --> 04:52.017
James Monroe?

04:52.050 --> 04:54.359
Yes, like the fifth president.

04:54.390 --> 04:56.927
My dad was reading his
biography when I was born.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.552
Anyway, I heard the shots.

04:58.590 --> 05:00.626
I saw a guy wearing a mask
come running out.

05:00.660 --> 05:03.458
He was halfway down the street
by the time I got over here.

05:03.500 --> 05:04.694
Can you describe him?

05:04.730 --> 05:05.560
He took his mask off
while he was running,

05:05.600 --> 05:06.897
but he was almost a
hundred feet away.

05:06.940 --> 05:10.432
His back was to me.
He had dark hair.

05:10.470 --> 05:11.459
Wish I could tell you more.

05:11.510 --> 05:13.671
Sorry to interrupt
your doctrine.

05:13.710 --> 05:14.677
You know there's blood

05:14.710 --> 05:15.734
on the car over here?

05:20.580 --> 05:22.616
Yeah, Cheryl said
she hit the guy.

05:22.650 --> 05:24.015
Doesn't look
like he lost much blood.

05:24.050 --> 05:26.848
He could run,
so maybe she just grazed him.

05:26.890 --> 05:29.017
Bell,

05:29.060 --> 05:30.880
she's ready to talk.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.756
CHERYL: Just seemed
like it happened so fast.

05:34.800 --> 05:35.755
He was already inside

05:35.800 --> 05:38.963
when I came home, and I...

05:39.000 --> 05:40.797
I don't even know how he got in.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.808
You didn't have the alarm on?

05:45.770 --> 05:48.034
He had this mask on.

05:48.080 --> 05:49.968
I can describe it_ to
a comp05ite artist.

05:50.010 --> 05:51.671
He had a Glock
handgun--

05:51.710 --> 05:53.746
a 21, I think.

05:53.780 --> 05:56.988
He was about six-two,
maybe 170 pounds,

05:57.020 --> 05:59.955
and I would definitely recognize
his voice if I heard it again.

05:59.990 --> 06:03.653
Now, before tonight,
had either of you two noticed

06:03.690 --> 06:05.658
anything odd--
cars you didn't recognize,

06:05.690 --> 06:08.818
anyone who seemed unusually
interested in the captain?

06:10.170 --> 06:11.569
You?

06:11.600 --> 06:13.761
No.

06:16.100 --> 06:18.568
But I'm not living here
at the moment.

06:21.810 --> 06:24.608
For how long?

06:24.650 --> 06:26.777
For about a month.

06:26.820 --> 06:30.881
Mrs. Gregson, your
mother just got here.

06:33.790 --> 06:35.781
Okay.

06:41.560 --> 06:44.461
Now, look, my wife's the
victim here, I'm the target,

06:44.500 --> 06:46.934
so obviously I can't
run point on this case,

06:46.970 --> 06:50.007
so let me _be clear: I'm not
running p0int when I tell you

06:50.040 --> 06:53.168
I want a rush on the prints
and the serology.

06:53.210 --> 06:55.838
If this guy's got
a vendetta against a cop,

06:55.880 --> 06:58.098
there's a good chance
he's in the system.

07:00.150 --> 07:02.914
Captain.

07:02.950 --> 07:05.441
It hardly needs saying,
but Watson and I will devote

07:05.490 --> 07:07.515
our full attention
to this matter.

07:07.560 --> 07:09.687
We might need access
to your files,

07:09.730 --> 07:10.981
personal
and professional.

07:11.030 --> 07:12.554
There's a good chance we'll need

07:12.600 --> 07:14.556
to examine your life
in minute detail.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.864
You don't tend to shed much
light on your private affairs,

07:16.900 --> 07:19.562
so... comfortable with that?

07:19.600 --> 07:20.931
Whatever you need.

07:20.970 --> 07:23.962
Just help Marcus
find this guy.

07:29.680 --> 07:31.170
WATSON:
Did you know that
Captain Gregson

07:31.210 --> 07:33.576
turned down a promotion
that would have made him

07:33.620 --> 07:35.576
the youngest detective
in the NYPD?

07:35.620 --> 07:37.645
He didn't want to work
for Internal Affairs.

07:37.690 --> 07:39.009
He is also,

07:39.050 --> 07:41.484
judging by his e-mails,
surprisingly tolerant

07:41.520 --> 07:43.488
of forwarded videos
of mischievous kittens.

07:43.530 --> 07:45.953
He never talks about
any of these things.

07:45.990 --> 07:47.651
I guess I shouldn't
be surprised. I mean,

07:47.700 --> 07:48.997
none of us even knew
he was separated

07:49.030 --> 07:50.895
until tonight.
I knew.

07:50.930 --> 07:52.989
Had my suspicions,
anyway.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.667
He's been arriving
earlier in the morning,

07:54.700 --> 07:57.009
leaving later, stopped
bringing home-packed lunches.

07:57.040 --> 07:59.235
Well, if you knew, then why
didn't you say something to him?

07:59.270 --> 08:00.908
Well, why would I?

08:00.940 --> 08:02.498
His work hasn't suffered.

08:02.550 --> 08:04.108
If anything, he's been
slightly more focused.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.914
Quite frankly, I'm surprised
it's taken this long

08:06.950 --> 08:08.508
for the captain's marriage
to buckle.

08:08.550 --> 08:10.040
He's an excellent detective.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.149
What does that
have to do with it?

08:12.190 --> 08:15.751
Well, as you know, detection
is a calling, not a job.

08:15.790 --> 08:17.621
Hardly leaves one
with time left over

08:17.660 --> 08:20.026
to sustain the elaborate ruse
of marriage.

08:20.060 --> 08:22.028
Because, of course,
you think marriage

08:22.060 --> 08:23.266
is an elaborate ruse.

08:23.300 --> 08:25.120
There are other ways
to describe it.

08:25.170 --> 08:27.832
An unnatural arrangement
which forces its participants

08:27.870 --> 08:29.167
into an unhealthy monogamy.

08:29.200 --> 08:32.101
An accretion of petty fights
and resentful compromises

08:32.140 --> 08:33.835
which, like
Chinese water torture,

08:33.880 --> 08:35.905
slowly transforms both parties

08:35.940 --> 08:38.272
into howling, neurotic versions
of their former selves.

08:38.310 --> 08:39.868
Yeah.

08:39.920 --> 08:43.048
So, anyway, I found
about 20 cases so far

08:43.090 --> 08:45.012
with perps that
fit the description

08:45.050 --> 08:47.712
that Mrs. Gregson gave us.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.853
So, I'll keep
sifting through,

08:49.890 --> 08:52.029
if you want to take
a look at them.

08:52.060 --> 08:53.948
Mmm, not necessary.
I was fairly certain

08:54.000 --> 08:55.820
that listing
the captain's enemies

08:55.860 --> 08:57.259
via reviewing his casework

08:57.300 --> 08:59.268
was a fool's errand.

08:59.300 --> 09:00.631
Now I'm all but positive.

09:00.670 --> 09:01.739
The kind of criminal

09:01.770 --> 09:03.237
the captain pursues
tends to be

09:03.270 --> 09:05.261
intelligent--
the sort of person who knows

09:05.310 --> 09:07.938
that attacking a policeman
is very bad business indeed.

09:07.980 --> 09:10.949
I believe that we are hunting
for a different class of person.

09:10.980 --> 09:13.869
Someone driven
by sound and fury.

09:13.920 --> 09:15.239
An idiot.

09:15.280 --> 09:18.989
Someone like, for example,
Dustin Bishop.

09:19.020 --> 09:20.954
There was little of interest
in the captain's in-box,

09:20.990 --> 09:24.255
so I took the time
to sift through his...

09:24.290 --> 09:25.882
spam filter.

09:25.930 --> 09:28.023
Now, Mr. Bishop
has been sending the captain...

09:28.060 --> 09:30.096
fan letters,
I suppose you'd call them,

09:30.130 --> 09:31.666
for quite some time now.

09:31.700 --> 09:34.134
They get more intimate
with the passage of time.

09:34.170 --> 09:36.900
More disturbing.
WATSON: "Hey, buddy,
can I still call you buddy

09:36.940 --> 09:38.100
"even though
you never write back?

09:38.140 --> 09:39.732
"I don't know
what your problem is,

09:39.780 --> 09:41.077
but I know I'm getting upset."

09:41.110 --> 09:42.202
This guy sounds like a stalker.

09:42.240 --> 09:44.299
_ Mmm. Looks like
just the sort of person

09:44.350 --> 09:46.818
_ to catch a bullet_ _
during a botched home inva5ion.

09:46.850 --> 09:48.841
Don't you think?

09:49.890 --> 09:51.778
(elevator bell clinging)

09:52.790 --> 09:54.018
MAN:
Good morning, sir.

09:54.060 --> 09:55.049
Morning.

09:56.060 --> 09:57.027
Hello, Captain.

09:57.060 --> 09:58.618
Morning.
WOMAN: Hi, sir.

09:58.660 --> 10:00.127
Hey.
Morning, Captain.

10:00.160 --> 10:02.128
Hello.

10:02.160 --> 10:05.766
Please tell me you have
some actual work to talk about.

10:05.800 --> 10:08.166
Yeah. We just heard back
from Latent Prints.

10:08.200 --> 10:10.407
All the prints
on Cheryl's car were hers.

10:10.440 --> 10:13.079
Perp must've had gloves on.
We did get a good

10:13.110 --> 10:16.238
DNA sample from the blood,
but there was no match in CODIS.

10:16.280 --> 10:18.077
I know, not what
we hoped for,

10:18.110 --> 10:19.816
but I got
a detail together,

10:19.850 --> 10:22.887
and Holmes and Watson
are off running down

10:22.920 --> 10:24.785
some Holmes-and-
Watson thing, so...

10:24.820 --> 10:26.959
Mmm.
And Ijust
wanted to say I'm...

10:26.990 --> 10:30.027
I'm sorry about you and Cheryl.

10:31.060 --> 10:33.028
Thanks.

10:33.060 --> 10:35.153
What else?
I caught this case,
so I have to be

10:35.200 --> 10:37.896
the one to ask--
you sure there's no way

10:37.930 --> 10:39.898
the separation's connected
to what happened last night?

10:39.940 --> 10:41.168
Come on.

10:44.710 --> 10:47.031
It's a trial separation.

10:47.080 --> 10:50.049
It's... it's no big deal.

10:50.080 --> 10:52.173
Kids are gone from home now,

10:52.210 --> 10:54.417
and everything feels
a little different.

10:56.890 --> 10:59.688
Aanay, Cheryl wants
some time alone;

10:59.720 --> 11:01.859
I'm giving it to her.

11:01.890 --> 11:04.984
That's the whole story.

11:05.030 --> 11:06.895
Thanks.
Okay.

11:06.930 --> 11:10.923
And, uh, I'll let you know when
we have anything, all right?

11:15.040 --> 11:16.905
Dustin Bishop!

11:16.940 --> 11:18.737
Would you open the door, please?

11:18.770 --> 11:21.000
We'd like to talk to you
about your correspondence

11:21.040 --> 11:23.247
with Thomas Gregson.

11:23.280 --> 11:25.202
(water running)

11:25.250 --> 11:27.115
You hear the
water running?

11:27.150 --> 11:29.789
Yeah.

11:33.120 --> 11:35.315
After you.

11:37.160 --> 11:39.799
(clicking)

11:42.230 --> 11:44.460
(water running)

12:06.520 --> 12:09.057
(door creaks open)

12:09.090 --> 12:11.126
(water running)

12:11.160 --> 12:14.220
He's got a gunshot wound.
He's lost a lot of blood.

12:26.440 --> 12:28.032
Yeah. Thanks.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.048
So, that was
the hospital.

12:30.080 --> 12:32.105
The doctors pulled
a .38-caliber slug

12:32.150 --> 12:34.243
out of Bishop's
right shoulder.

12:34.280 --> 12:36.885
He's stable, but he won't
be awake for a while.

12:36.920 --> 12:38.285
Also, we should get
the preliminary

12:38.320 --> 12:39.958
DNA results back
soon, we'll know

12:39.990 --> 12:41.878
for sure if he's the one
who broke into your house.

12:41.920 --> 12:42.955
HOLMES:
We shouldn't waste
time waiting.

12:42.990 --> 12:45.083
The DNA won't be a match.

12:45.130 --> 12:47.052
This guy's got my pictures
all over his wall.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.295
The doctors just took my wife's
bullet out of his shoulder.

12:49.330 --> 12:50.922
I don't believe
it was your wife's bullet.

12:50.970 --> 12:52.267
I believe
that Bishop shot himself.

12:52.300 --> 12:53.289
Surely you noted

12:53.340 --> 12:54.830
the two handguns
in the bathroom.

12:54.870 --> 12:55.894
There was a Glock 21,

12:55.940 --> 12:57.430
same as the assailant carried,

12:57.470 --> 12:59.062
and then there was
the .38 revolver,

12:59.110 --> 13:00.077
same one used
to shoot the attacker.

13:00.110 --> 13:01.805
Why would Bishop shoot himself?

13:01.840 --> 13:03.205
Well, I think
he intended to confess

13:03.250 --> 13:04.842
to a crime he didn't commit.

13:04.880 --> 13:06.040
Man is clearly
disturbed.

13:06.080 --> 13:07.342
There are antipsychotic
medications

13:07.380 --> 13:09.211
in the bathroom cabinet;
they haven't been refilled

13:09.250 --> 13:11.309
in quite some time.
Two guns, a prescription.

13:11.350 --> 13:13.215
That doesn't mean
Bishop didn't do it.
No, but

13:13.260 --> 13:15.216
the fact that he shot himself
in the wrong shoulder does.

13:15.260 --> 13:17.558
The blood on your wife's car
was on the driver's side

13:17.590 --> 13:18.887
window, had to have been
on the left

13:18.930 --> 13:20.329
of the attacker as he fled.

13:20.360 --> 13:22.328
Ergo, the wound was
in his left shoulder.

13:22.360 --> 13:24.920
Bishop shot himself
in the right shoulder.

13:24.970 --> 13:27.461
(phone chimes)
It's the lab.

13:27.500 --> 13:30.060
Blood's not a match.

13:30.110 --> 13:32.169
It's wrong type.

13:32.210 --> 13:34.269
Look, I know
it's frustrating,

13:34.310 --> 13:35.538
_ but whoever broke
into your house knows

13:35.580 --> 13:37.548
we're looking for him,
he knows we got

13:37.580 --> 13:39.502
a protective detail
on Cheryl, on you.

13:39.550 --> 13:41.313
He's not getting violent again.

13:56.900 --> 13:58.299
(gunshot)

14:05.410 --> 14:07.071
BELL:
Name is Sam Clennon.

14:07.110 --> 14:09.977
According to the evidence, you
two have a friend in common.

14:10.010 --> 14:12.046
GREGSON:
I've never seen
this guy before.

14:12.080 --> 14:14.275
Never even
heard his name.

14:14.320 --> 14:16.072
Are you sure he was killed
by the same man

14:16.120 --> 14:17.109
that threatened Mrs. Gregson?

14:17.150 --> 14:19.038
Sure? No.

14:19.090 --> 14:22.355
But a security camera
outside Mr. Clennon's

14:22.390 --> 14:24.358
building caught
this around

14:24.390 --> 14:26.620
10:30 last night.

14:26.660 --> 14:28.457
I already showed this to Cheryl.

14:28.500 --> 14:31.060
She's pretty positive
it's the same guy.

14:31.100 --> 14:33.989
And Clennon was shot
with a Glock 21,

14:34.040 --> 14:35.894
just like the gun
she described.

14:35.940 --> 14:37.601
Now, if this is our guy,
and I'm thinking it is,

14:37.640 --> 14:40.006
got to figure this is what
he had in store for you

14:40.040 --> 14:42.201
the other night.
Obviously, last night
wasn't the first time

14:42.240 --> 14:44.401
someone tried to kill
Mr. Clennon.

14:44.450 --> 14:46.008
No, he's ex-mil...
Military, yeah.

14:46.050 --> 14:47.142
Shrapnel wounds are a bit
of a giveaway.

14:47.180 --> 14:50.445
As is the sun damage to
his hands and face. Afghanistan?

14:50.490 --> 14:53.186
He was between tours.
Got back a few weeks ago.

14:53.220 --> 14:54.949
There's an old
bullet wound here.

14:54.990 --> 14:57.129
More intrigued
by the stab wound.

14:57.160 --> 14:59.048
Most injuries sustained
by soldiers in the Middle East

14:59.090 --> 15:01.923
are from IED blasts or gunshots.

15:01.960 --> 15:04.520
This man has managed
to get himself stabbed.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.060
Almost quaint.

15:06.100 --> 15:08.989
You're sure you've never seen
this guy before?

15:09.040 --> 15:11.565
Neven
I'm not sure
I trust that answer.

15:11.610 --> 15:14.579
Trust it. _ _
Oh, I'm just saying it's
possible there's a connection

15:14.610 --> 15:16.703
between Mr. Clennon and you,
and you don't remember.

15:16.740 --> 15:20.119
This man's death,
although unfortunate,
must be viewed as progress.

15:20.150 --> 15:22.573
We now know the killer
has an agenda which
is not limited to you.

15:22.620 --> 15:25.111
Watson and I
Will continue

15:25.150 --> 15:27.254
to pore over your case files.

15:27.290 --> 15:30.680
If we can find a connection,
maybe we can find the culprit.

15:30.730 --> 15:31.958
Gentlemen.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.254
(door opens)

15:36.300 --> 15:38.029
(door closes)

15:38.070 --> 15:39.492
One more thing.

15:39.530 --> 15:41.361
A dog walker in
your neighborhood

15:41.400 --> 15:43.209
called the precinct
a little while ago,

15:43.240 --> 15:45.162
said she'd seen the same
light blue pickup truck

15:45.210 --> 15:46.563
parked in front of your house

15:46.610 --> 15:48.168
on at least two occasions
last week.

15:48.210 --> 15:50.599
Light blue?

15:52.610 --> 15:54.419
No.

15:59.720 --> 16:01.711
Oh, Detective Basken.

16:04.530 --> 16:07.192
I just wanted to let you know
that it's gonna take me

16:07.230 --> 16:09.289
a few more days before I can dig
into those files,

16:09.330 --> 16:11.059
what with everything happening
with Captain Gregson.

16:11.100 --> 16:13.694
Okay. Um...

16:13.740 --> 16:16.197
uh, Holmes didn't talk to you?

16:19.170 --> 16:22.139
You solved the case
that Basken gave me?

16:22.180 --> 16:23.101
What's a Basken?

16:23.150 --> 16:25.106
Detective Basken.

16:25.150 --> 16:27.072
He asked me to look
into a string of robberies.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.348
I brought the files home
with me yesterday.

16:28.380 --> 16:30.211
Oh, yes.
That Basken.

16:30.250 --> 16:33.151
I refer to most of the
detectives here as "not Bell."

16:33.190 --> 16:35.055
He just told me
that you e-mailed him last night

16:35.090 --> 16:37.024
with the rap sheet of a guy
that you thought

16:37.060 --> 16:38.652
was robbing food vendors
in the West Village.

16:38.690 --> 16:41.090
Basken just picked him up
an hour ago, and he confessed.

16:41.130 --> 16:43.223
I was up late last night
ruminating the captain's case.

16:43.270 --> 16:45.261
The files you're talking about
were in the study,

16:45.300 --> 16:46.619
and I needed a palate cleanser.

16:46.670 --> 16:48.467
A palate cleanser?

16:48.500 --> 16:50.263
The solution presented itself
rather quickly.

16:50.310 --> 16:52.107
Was I supposed to keep it
to myself?

16:52.140 --> 16:54.028
It was my case.
In point of
fact, Watson,

16:54.080 --> 16:55.331
it was Detective Basken's case.

16:55.380 --> 16:57.268
You were merely consulting.
As was I.

16:57.310 --> 16:59.073
I didn't ask you
to look into it.

16:59.110 --> 17:00.646
Nor did you ask me not to.
No, I...

17:00.680 --> 17:02.170
We live together,
we work together, Watson.

17:02.220 --> 17:04.142
When it comes
to cases,

17:04.190 --> 17:06.579
there is no "his" or "hers";
there is partnership.

17:06.620 --> 17:08.315
I assist you, you assist me.

17:08.360 --> 17:11.249
What matters is the result.
Or do you disagree?

17:11.290 --> 17:13.224
It's not about disagreeing...
BELL:
Hey, I just got

17:13.260 --> 17:14.727
the contact info
for Sam Clennon's mom.

17:14.760 --> 17:16.489
Thought you might want
to come with me

17:16.530 --> 17:18.259
to make the next of kin
notification,

17:18.300 --> 17:20.097
see if she can point us
toward anyone

17:20.140 --> 17:22.563
who had a problem with her son.

17:22.600 --> 17:25.467
Unless you're in the
middle of something.

17:25.510 --> 17:27.239
No.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.134
We're good.

17:30.610 --> 17:32.544
(sighs)

17:34.380 --> 17:36.371
Hey, guys.

17:39.550 --> 17:42.383
Hot coffee.

17:45.560 --> 17:48.757
Hi. I didn't realize
you'd be stopping by today.

17:48.800 --> 17:51.360
Is everything okay?

17:51.400 --> 17:53.265
Mind if we talk inside?

17:53.300 --> 17:55.234
Sure.

17:59.410 --> 18:02.277
Mikey put on some weight, huh?

18:02.310 --> 18:05.143
He was so skinny
back when he was a uni.

18:05.180 --> 18:06.670
I could've stirred my coffee
with him.

18:06.710 --> 18:10.111
Have you seen
Steven Accorsi lately?

18:10.150 --> 18:13.859
Bell told me someone
saw a light blue pickup

18:13.890 --> 18:15.858
parked in front of our
house a few times.

18:15.890 --> 18:17.619
And I was thinking,
"Hey, wait a minute.

18:17.660 --> 18:20.424
I know someone with
a light blue pickup."

18:20.460 --> 18:22.325
He's a friend.

18:22.360 --> 18:23.463
Always has been.

18:23.500 --> 18:24.865
A friend...

18:24.900 --> 18:27.460
who's suddenly
in the habit

18:27.500 --> 18:29.866
of parking in front
of our house.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.765
He came here twice.
The first time,

18:31.810 --> 18:34.438
I just needed some help
moving some furniture.

18:34.480 --> 18:36.471
And the second?

18:38.450 --> 18:40.441
I made him dinner.

18:41.750 --> 18:43.718
Nothing happened.

18:43.750 --> 18:45.411
Nothing is going to happen.

18:45.450 --> 18:47.213
Steven knows that.

18:48.290 --> 18:50.326
(sighs)

18:50.360 --> 18:53.557
Yeah, well,
maybe he's not the person

18:53.600 --> 18:56.319
I'm having a real
problem with right now.

18:56.360 --> 18:58.260
I'm sorry.

18:58.300 --> 19:01.337
Do you not know the definition
of the word "separated"?

19:01.370 --> 19:04.305
I can have dinner
with whoever I want.

19:04.340 --> 19:07.173
You said all you needed
was some time.

19:07.210 --> 19:09.371
Well, were you under the
impression that I was just going

19:09.410 --> 19:11.708
to be meditating here
like a monk?

19:11.750 --> 19:15.345
You never said anything
about seeing other people.

19:15.380 --> 19:17.439
I said that I wasn't happy.

19:17.490 --> 19:20.288
I suppose I should just, uh,

19:20.320 --> 19:23.528
go out and pick up some...

19:23.560 --> 19:25.357
floozy at a bar.

19:25.390 --> 19:27.290
You want to? Be my guest.

19:30.730 --> 19:33.437
What I want...

19:33.470 --> 19:35.495
is to be with my wife.

19:35.540 --> 19:37.462
Now?

19:37.510 --> 19:41.276
After 28 years of missed dinners
and weekends at the precinct?

19:41.310 --> 19:42.834
Come on.

19:42.880 --> 19:47.510
When did I ever tell you I
wanted to be anything but a cop?

19:47.550 --> 19:51.748
When did I tell you that I was
always gonna be okay with that?

19:55.520 --> 19:59.456
MRS. CLENNON:
He made it through three tours
in Afghanistan.

20:02.530 --> 20:04.725
He comes back here, where
he's supposed to be safe,

20:04.770 --> 20:07.489
and gets killed
in his own home.

20:07.540 --> 20:08.962
Mrs. Clennon,

20:09.000 --> 20:11.560
we think what happened
to your son may be connected

20:11.610 --> 20:13.578
to a break-in at the home

20:13.610 --> 20:15.805
of a New York Police captain
the other night.

20:15.840 --> 20:18.377
Does the name Thomas Gregson
mean anything to you?

20:18.410 --> 20:20.412
No.

20:20.450 --> 20:22.270
_ Sam never
mentioned him before?

20:22.320 --> 20:23.912
Neven

20:23.950 --> 20:26.510
Can you think of anyone who
might have wanted to hurt Sam?

20:26.550 --> 20:28.518
No.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.482
Everybody liked him.

20:30.530 --> 20:32.555
Not everyone, obviously.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.355
There was his killer, of course,

20:36.400 --> 20:38.994
but also the person
who stabbed him.

20:39.030 --> 20:40.895
You know about that?
Well, I noticed

20:40.940 --> 20:43.568
the mark this morning.
I-I said to my colleagues

20:43.610 --> 20:46.568
that I thought it might not be
due to his military service.

20:46.610 --> 20:48.373
Would that be correct?

20:48.410 --> 20:51.573
Well, yes and no.

20:51.610 --> 20:54.545
During Sam's last tour,
there was this...

20:54.580 --> 20:56.639
guy who was having trouble
adjusting.

20:56.680 --> 21:00.980
Sam knew how hard deployment
could be, wanted to help, but...

21:01.020 --> 21:03.727
this guy...
(sighs)

21:03.760 --> 21:06.923
Jacob, he was too far gone.

21:06.960 --> 21:09.019
He snapped one day.

21:09.060 --> 21:11.893
He came at Sam with a knife.

21:11.930 --> 21:13.295
Do you remember
Jacob's last name?

21:13.340 --> 21:14.830
Esparza.

21:14.870 --> 21:17.668
Okay, I'll reach out
to the Army, see if we can't get

21:17.710 --> 21:20.406
some current contact info
on Mr. Esparza.

21:20.440 --> 21:23.307
You could try Lieutenant Monroe.

21:23.350 --> 21:24.374
Monroe?

21:24.410 --> 21:25.843
James.

21:25.880 --> 21:29.418
He was Sam's commanding officer
in Afghanistan.

21:29.450 --> 21:32.010
He lives here
in New York.

21:32.050 --> 21:34.018
The fifth president.

21:34.060 --> 21:35.618
WATSON:
We talked to him
outside the captain's house

21:35.660 --> 21:36.957
the other night.

21:36.990 --> 21:38.423
I remember. Buzz cut.

21:38.460 --> 21:39.449
Tattoo on his arm.

21:39.490 --> 21:41.958
Did you get a house number?

21:42.000 --> 21:44.594
(phone ringing)

21:45.970 --> 21:47.597
What?

21:47.640 --> 21:49.335
Captain, your assistant said
you'd gone to see your wife.

21:49.370 --> 21:50.337
Are you still there?

21:50.370 --> 21:51.564
I'm just leaving. Why?

21:51.610 --> 21:53.532
Your neighbor, James Monroe,
you need to take

21:53.580 --> 21:55.536
your wife's protective detail,
go to his house.

21:55.580 --> 21:57.468
What? Why?

21:57.510 --> 21:58.738
We now know the connection
between you

21:58.780 --> 22:00.611
and the second victim,
Sam Clennon.

22:00.650 --> 22:02.811
Or, rather, we know
that there is no connection.

22:02.850 --> 22:04.408
The killer wasn't after you.

22:04.450 --> 22:05.712
That's not what he told Cheryl.

22:05.750 --> 22:07.957
No, he-he told her
he was after her husband.

22:07.990 --> 22:09.582
Never mentioned you by name.

22:09.620 --> 22:11.656
O'Malley, Grell,
I need you with me.

22:13.430 --> 22:14.852
Sam Clennon _served under
James Monroe in Afghanistan.

22:14.900 --> 22:16.128
They knew each other.

22:16.160 --> 22:17.798
More importantly, if you enter

22:17.830 --> 22:19.559
Monroe's address
into "Maps Earth,"

22:19.600 --> 22:21.465
a picture of your house
comes up.

22:21.500 --> 22:23.434
It's quite common, apparently.

22:23.470 --> 22:24.869
Although instead of receiving
something as mundane

22:24.910 --> 22:26.502
as a pizza
ordered by your neighbor...

22:26.540 --> 22:28.804
I got the guy
that was coming to kill him.

22:28.840 --> 22:30.444
We need to locate

22:30.480 --> 22:31.799
Lieutenant Monroe
before the killer

22:31.850 --> 22:33.374
realizes his mistake.

22:33.420 --> 22:34.569
(doorbell ringing)

22:34.620 --> 22:36.542
James, it's Tommy Gregson.

22:36.580 --> 22:37.808
I need to speak with you.

22:37.850 --> 22:39.408
You home?
(knocking)

22:39.450 --> 22:40.678
It's important.

22:50.730 --> 22:52.618
BELL:
The M.E. thought
he was killed last night,

22:52.670 --> 22:54.035
just a few hours
after Sam Clennon.

22:54.070 --> 22:55.765
No prints or DNA found
at the scene,

22:55.800 --> 22:57.563
but those casings
were from a Glock 21.

22:57.610 --> 23:01.137
So you were right.
This was the work of our guy.

23:01.180 --> 23:02.807
BELL:
Yeah, looks that way.

23:02.840 --> 23:05.445
Now, the good news is, we think
we've identified a suspect.

23:05.480 --> 23:07.448
Name is Jacob Esparza.

23:07.480 --> 23:09.812
He served under
James Monroe in Afghanistan.

23:09.850 --> 23:11.784
So did Sam Clennon.

23:11.820 --> 23:14.186
Height and weight would be in
line with Cheryl's description.

23:14.220 --> 23:16.780
Clennon's mother told us
he was attacked by Esparza

23:16.820 --> 23:18.822
in their barracks
about a year ago.

23:18.860 --> 23:20.623
Clennon took a
knife to the gut.

23:20.660 --> 23:22.093
Now, the incident report

23:22.130 --> 23:23.620
that Lieutenant Monroe wrote up

23:23.670 --> 23:24.796
pretty much sealed
Esparza's fate.

23:24.830 --> 23:28.459
But Esparza says
it was trumped up, and that

23:28.500 --> 23:30.707
Monroe and Clennon had
it in for him for months.

23:30.740 --> 23:32.765
Also, given the fact that he
dropped out of high school

23:32.810 --> 23:34.505
and he barely
passed his GED,

23:34.540 --> 23:35.871
makes him something less
than a Rhodes scholar,

23:35.910 --> 23:37.207
which makes it less surprising

23:37.240 --> 23:38.844
that he broke
into the wrong house.

23:38.880 --> 23:40.142
(phone chimes)
Hmm. Sorry.

23:40.180 --> 23:42.114
It's Crawford and Gleason.

23:42.150 --> 23:44.186
They just picked up Esparza
at his residence.

23:44.220 --> 23:45.949
GREGSON:
Hey, I know
I still can't

23:45.990 --> 23:48.015
take point, but let me know
when they get here.

23:48.060 --> 23:50.585
All right.

23:50.630 --> 23:52.780
(Gregson clears throat)

23:53.830 --> 23:55.024
(door closes)

23:55.060 --> 23:56.220
You need something?

23:56.260 --> 23:59.866
You, uh... you
glanced at me.

23:59.900 --> 24:01.128
I beg your pardon?

24:01.170 --> 24:02.865
You glanced at me twice
earlier on.

24:02.900 --> 24:04.458
Yeah, I do that
sometimes

24:04.510 --> 24:06.831
when someone's standing
right in front of me.

24:06.870 --> 24:08.838
Yeah, but your glances
were furtive.

24:10.650 --> 24:13.210
I was thinking
about asking you something

24:13.250 --> 24:14.911
after all this is over,

24:14.950 --> 24:16.975
and then I realized
how crazy it was,

24:17.020 --> 24:18.885
so I decided
to keep it to myself.

24:18.920 --> 24:20.478
You know,
people can do that.

24:20.520 --> 24:21.851
Is it something about your wife?

24:25.160 --> 24:28.095
I found out today
that she's seen this guy

24:28.130 --> 24:30.826
that she grew up with
a couple of times.

24:30.870 --> 24:32.519
"A friend."

24:32.570 --> 24:33.935
He's a contractor.

24:33.970 --> 24:36.131
He did some work
on our house over the years.

24:36.170 --> 24:38.058
So you were thinking
of asking me to investigate him?

24:38.110 --> 24:40.931
I was thinking about,
and then I reconsidered,

24:40.980 --> 24:44.177
because like I said,
it was a crazy...

24:44.210 --> 24:47.873
Anyway, it's...
it's probably too late.

24:47.920 --> 24:50.138
She and I... talked.

24:54.860 --> 24:57.055
_ I don't think
it's gonna work out.

25:03.000 --> 25:07.539
If you should need
someone to talk to, then,

25:07.570 --> 25:09.891
please know I'll, uh...

25:09.940 --> 25:12.204
I'll make Watson
available to you.

25:16.580 --> 25:17.877
(laughs)

25:17.910 --> 25:20.743
BELL: _
You see something
funny, Jacob?

25:20.780 --> 25:22.748
Just thinking.

25:22.780 --> 25:26.079
Even dead, these guys are still
managing to mess with me.

25:26.120 --> 25:28.554
So you admit you
weren't a fan.

25:28.590 --> 25:30.217
No.

25:30.260 --> 25:32.820
BELL:
You, Jacob, are what we
in law enforcement call

25:32.860 --> 25:34.054
a "cool customer."

25:34.100 --> 25:35.897
It's not exactly
what I expected

25:35.930 --> 25:37.625
given your, uh,
military record.

25:37.670 --> 25:39.797
Yeah, probably 'cause
you believed all that crap

25:39.830 --> 25:41.036
about me cracking up,

25:41.070 --> 25:42.628
right?

25:42.670 --> 25:44.638
There some other reason
you stabbed Sam Clennon?

25:47.640 --> 25:50.871
I proposed to my girl right
before I left for Afghanistan.

25:50.910 --> 25:53.105
Three months into my deployment,
I find out

25:53.150 --> 25:55.243
she's shacked up
with my best friend.

25:55.280 --> 25:57.942
Weren't married yet,
but it still felt like adultery.

25:57.990 --> 26:00.959
So, when I found out that one
of the guys from my unit was

26:00.990 --> 26:03.288
hooking up with a girl
who I knew had a husband

26:03.320 --> 26:07.029
back in the States,
I took that real seriously.

26:07.060 --> 26:10.325
You saying you stabbed Clennon
because he was having an affair?

26:10.360 --> 26:13.158
I called him_out _
because he was havmg an affair.

26:13.200 --> 26:15.031
He got physical.

26:15.070 --> 26:16.890
I was just defending myself.

26:16.940 --> 26:19.204
That's not how
this murdered man

26:19.240 --> 26:20.901
described the incident
in his report.

26:20.940 --> 26:22.874
Course he didn't, 'cause Clennon

26:22.910 --> 26:25.003
was the lieutenant's boy.
They were tight.

26:25.050 --> 26:26.779
Can you account
for your whereabouts

26:26.810 --> 26:30.246
the last two nights between the
hours of 8:00 and 11:00 p.m.?

26:30.280 --> 26:32.339
I was home.

26:32.390 --> 26:33.687
Can anyone verify that?

26:33.720 --> 26:35.688
Nah.
If we were to ask you

26:35.720 --> 26:38.655
to take off your shirt, would we
find any fresh bullet wounds?

26:40.060 --> 26:42.358
I look shot to you?

26:42.400 --> 26:45.062
The individual we're looking for
got winged the other night.

26:45.100 --> 26:46.920
You don't have a wound,
you don't have anything

26:46.970 --> 26:48.733
to worry about.

27:00.310 --> 27:02.915
Guess I got nothing
to worry about.

27:10.830 --> 27:12.684
You're conscious. Excellent.
We're gomg to Queens.

27:12.730 --> 27:13.958
Why are we going
to Queens?

27:14.000 --> 27:15.194
To visit the home wrecked

27:15.230 --> 27:16.720
by home-wrecker
Sam Clennon, of course.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.660
Jacob Esparza gave us
the name of the woman

27:18.700 --> 27:20.258
that Clennon was sleeping with
in Afghanistan.

27:20.300 --> 27:22.097
Elizabeth Roney.
Looked into her.

27:22.140 --> 27:25.268
Turns out, not a fellow soldier,
but an archaeologist overseeing

27:25.310 --> 27:27.904
the excavation of artifacts
from a Buddhist temple.

27:27.940 --> 27:29.134
I'd say that her husband
had motive

27:29.180 --> 27:30.875
to want Clennon dead.
Wouldn't you?

27:30.910 --> 27:33.708
Yeah, but why kill
Lieutenant Monroe, as well?

27:33.750 --> 27:36.116
As I said the other day, Watson,
monogamy is not a natural state.

27:36.150 --> 27:38.038
In Dr. Roney's case, perhaps
one affair was not enough.

27:42.020 --> 27:45.023
(barking)

27:47.260 --> 27:49.694
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

27:49.730 --> 27:51.220
Oh, I'm really sorry.

27:51.270 --> 27:53.830
She's, uh,

27:53.870 --> 27:55.292
sort of a man-hater.

27:55.340 --> 27:58.036
Goes crazy every time
some guy walks past the yard.

27:58.070 --> 27:59.139
We weren't walking past,
actually.

27:59.170 --> 28:00.467
We were walking in.

28:00.510 --> 28:01.829
Elizabeth Roney?

28:01.880 --> 28:02.904
Yeah. Beth.

28:02.940 --> 28:04.373
Can I help you?

28:04.410 --> 28:06.378
I'm sorry.

28:06.410 --> 28:08.469
This is just a
lot to take in.

28:08.520 --> 28:11.739
Sam and I weren't together
very long, but still,

28:11.790 --> 28:14.759
it's-it's hard to
believe he's gone.

28:14.790 --> 28:17.384
I'm surprised you didn't hear
about what happened on the news.

28:17.420 --> 28:21.459
I've been overseeing a dig
in Kabul the last few days.

28:21.500 --> 28:23.821
Um, ordinarily, I'd be on site,

28:23.870 --> 28:27.226
but when teaching opportunities
pop up here in New York,

28:27.270 --> 28:29.238
I take advantage
of the technology.

28:29.270 --> 28:32.000
These, um... are
eight and a half hours ahead,

28:32.040 --> 28:33.439
so I've been
keeping odd hours,

28:33.470 --> 28:35.074
pulling a lot of all-nighters.

28:35.110 --> 28:37.169
Is your hus...
(barking)

28:37.210 --> 28:40.008
Gotham!

28:40.050 --> 28:43.076
Sorry. Like I said,
problems with men.

28:43.120 --> 28:45.418
Hmm. Is your husband around?

28:45.450 --> 28:47.247
We'd like to speak
with him, as well.

28:47.290 --> 28:50.453
Why would you want
to talk to Cameron?

28:50.490 --> 28:52.788
Sam Clennon, the man
that you had an affair with

28:52.830 --> 28:54.491
in Afghanistan,
was found dead, murdered

28:54.530 --> 28:56.350
in his home two nights ago.

28:56.400 --> 28:59.267
If you were me, wouldn't you
want to speak with your husband?

28:59.300 --> 29:01.439
Okay, there's been
some confusion.

29:01.470 --> 29:06.066
Yes, Sam and I were involved,
but it wasn't an affair.

29:06.110 --> 29:07.259
Not by a long shot.

29:07.310 --> 29:08.902
What do you mean?

29:08.940 --> 29:11.408
When we met, I was
excavating a site

29:11.450 --> 29:13.441
in Afghanistan called Mes Aynak.

29:13.480 --> 29:16.176
Sam's unit was assigned
as a security detail.

29:16.220 --> 29:18.438
Before I left the states,
Cameron and I were already

29:18.490 --> 29:20.082
halfway through
divorce proceedings.

29:20.120 --> 29:21.815
Yeah, technically,
we were married,

29:21.860 --> 29:23.384
but we weren't
a couple.

29:23.420 --> 29:25.183
Cameron moved to Arizona
to be With his new girlfriend,

29:25.230 --> 29:26.879
and I went to Mes Aynak.

29:26.930 --> 29:28.522
Now that I'm back,
I'm even mailing him

29:28.560 --> 29:30.926
some of his
old stuff.

29:34.140 --> 29:36.062
Were you ever
romantically involved

29:36.100 --> 29:37.362
with Lieutenant James Monroe?

29:37.400 --> 29:39.209
No.

29:39.240 --> 29:41.299
Why would you ask me that?

29:41.340 --> 29:44.548
Look, I wish I could tell you
Cameron was

29:44.580 --> 29:48.072
some nut or bad person,
but he wasn't.

29:48.120 --> 29:50.987
Even if he knew about Sam--
which he didn't--

29:51.020 --> 29:53.045
he would not have hurt him.

29:56.320 --> 29:58.254
(Buddhist chants playing
over stereo)

29:58.290 --> 30:01.157
I found the case ﬁle
that Detective Basken gave me

30:01.200 --> 30:02.997
right outside my room.

30:03.030 --> 30:04.463
I put it there.

30:04.500 --> 30:06.127
Any particular reason?

30:06.170 --> 30:08.161
You seemed miffed
that I'd solved it.

30:08.200 --> 30:09.599
I thought, for
your own training,

30:09.640 --> 30:11.232
you might want to
review the file,

30:11.270 --> 30:12.931
see if the answer
presents itself.

30:12.970 --> 30:14.176
I don't want to solve it now.

30:14.210 --> 30:16.007
I wanted to solve it
when it was unsolved.

30:16.040 --> 30:17.439
And I was only miffed
because I didn't have

30:17.480 --> 30:19.243
_ a chance to...
to figure it out on my own.

30:19.280 --> 30:22.113
As I explained, the essence of
our arrangement is partnership.

30:22.150 --> 30:24.289
Partnership implies equality.

30:24.320 --> 30:26.845
I'm good at this.
We both know that.

30:26.890 --> 30:29.279
You've been solving cases
since you were a kid.

30:29.320 --> 30:30.856
I've got some catching up to do.

30:30.890 --> 30:33.586
It takes, what, 10,000 hours
to master a skill?

30:33.630 --> 30:36.895
This file was an opportunity
for me to put some time in.

30:36.930 --> 30:39.194
Now it's not.
Okay, I don't want busywork,

30:39.230 --> 30:40.993
thank you very much.
I want to be useful.

30:41.040 --> 30:43.395
But you're meditating,
apparently.

30:45.240 --> 30:48.573
I'm learning everything
I can about Mes Aynak.

30:50.580 --> 30:53.140
Oh, that's the site
where Beth Roney worked

30:53.180 --> 30:54.340
with those
two Victims, right?

30:54.380 --> 30:56.314
Jacob Esparza
was stationed there, too.

30:56.350 --> 30:58.181
It seems to be a crossroads
in this particular puzzle.

30:58.220 --> 31:00.211
Fascinating place.

31:00.250 --> 31:03.151
The remains of several ancient
Buddhist settlements sit atop

31:03.190 --> 31:04.885
the world's second largest

31:04.930 --> 31:06.249
copper deposit.

31:06.290 --> 31:08.349
Six years ago, a Chinese company
was granted a lease

31:08.400 --> 31:10.322
to mine the copper,
but they can only do so

31:10.360 --> 31:11.566
once the site is razed.

31:11.600 --> 31:13.295
They're just going
to destroy it?

31:13.330 --> 31:15.059
Well, they would
if they had their way.

31:15.100 --> 31:18.228
But the plans incurred quite
a bit of negative press,

31:18.270 --> 31:19.601
in response to which

31:19.640 --> 31:22.370
the Afghan government
set up a rapid excavation.

31:22.410 --> 31:26.642
The mining is currently
on hold until 2014.

31:26.680 --> 31:29.217
Anything which is not
carefully removed before then

31:29.250 --> 31:30.945
will be lost forever.

31:30.990 --> 31:32.287
But they're beautiful.

31:32.320 --> 31:33.480
Not beautiful
enough, apparently,

31:33.520 --> 31:35.249
to delay access
to the world's

31:35.290 --> 31:38.020
second largest
copper deposit.

31:38.060 --> 31:40.119
James Monroe
and Sam Clennon

31:40.160 --> 31:41.388
were part of the unit
which was assigned

31:41.430 --> 31:43.921
to provide security
for the dig,

31:43.970 --> 31:45.392
a hastily-assembled
excavation

31:45.430 --> 31:46.988
of priceless artifacts.

31:47.030 --> 31:48.292
Corners were cut.

31:48.340 --> 31:50.262
You think they stole
from the site?

31:50.300 --> 31:51.961
I'm casting about for motive

31:52.010 --> 31:53.261
where it's proven
difficult to come by.

31:53.310 --> 31:55.130
Was anything reported stolen?
No.

31:55.180 --> 31:56.306
Which could mean

31:56.340 --> 31:58.274
that the robbery
was a phenomenal success.

31:58.310 --> 32:01.313
Or that it never happened.

32:04.750 --> 32:06.388
(sighs)

32:13.230 --> 32:16.256
Watson, you attempted
to work through the night.

32:16.300 --> 32:18.359
Ex_cellent.
Hmm. Did you sleep?

32:18.400 --> 32:20.220
In brief intervals.

32:20.270 --> 32:23.364
Tea, Tibetan fried bread.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.368
And the answer
we're looking for.

32:25.410 --> 32:27.139
What is this?

32:27.170 --> 32:28.706
It is a list of every artifact

32:28.740 --> 32:31.538
catalogued
at Mes Aynak thus far.

32:31.580 --> 32:34.071
_ The site contains
nine different temples.

32:34.120 --> 32:36.076
They've excavated seven.

32:36.120 --> 32:37.519
In each of those temples,

32:37.550 --> 32:39.609
they have found
a carved votive bowl

32:39.650 --> 32:41.709
common to Buddhist temples.

32:41.760 --> 32:43.512
Unique to copper-rich Mes Aynak,

32:43.560 --> 32:46.723
_ the bowls are adorned _
With green copper ornamentation.

32:46.760 --> 32:48.990
Hmm. Interesting.

32:49.030 --> 32:50.998
Not the answer I was looking
for, but interesting.

32:51.030 --> 32:52.622
They have found a bowl
in each of the temples

32:52.670 --> 32:54.399
they've excavated,
except for the last one.

32:54.440 --> 32:56.567
The one overseen
by Monroe and Clennon.

32:56.600 --> 32:58.306
In that dig,
there's no bowl.

32:58.340 --> 33:01.400
It was thought lost
to plunder or time or shelling,

33:01.440 --> 33:03.169
but I believe
it was stolen.

33:03.210 --> 33:05.371
Here is a picture
of one of the bowls

33:05.410 --> 33:08.174
recovered at the site.

33:08.220 --> 33:09.448
WATSON:
Beth Roney had a bowl

33:09.480 --> 33:11.141
just like this
in her office yesterday.

33:11.190 --> 33:12.441
She was working
With Monroe and Clennon.

33:12.490 --> 33:14.287
She prevented it from
being catalogued, and then she

33:14.320 --> 33:16.288
got it into their hands
so they could remove it

33:16.320 --> 33:18.356
from the site.
Okay, Why would she
steal an artifact

33:18.390 --> 33:20.426
and then just leave it
out in the open?

33:20.460 --> 33:21.620
No one even knows
it's missmg.

33:21.660 --> 33:23.321
She obviously felt
confident enough to hide it

33:23.360 --> 33:25.089
amongst other souvenirs
from her excavations.

33:25.130 --> 33:26.324
She isn't working alone.

33:26.370 --> 33:28.235
We know that a man
committed the murder,

33:28.270 --> 33:30.261
so she and her partner
are simply eliminating

33:30.300 --> 33:32.234
the other profit participants.

33:32.270 --> 33:33.532
Eat.

33:33.570 --> 33:36.539
Detective Bell is procuring
a search warrant.

33:36.580 --> 33:38.502
Once we've retrieved the bowl,
it should be simple enough

33:38.550 --> 33:40.643
to compel Dr. Roney to turn
on her accomplice, and then

33:40.680 --> 33:43.410
we'll have to decide What to do
With the rest of our afternoon.

33:44.550 --> 33:47.110
BETH:
This is absurd.

33:47.150 --> 33:49.209
(dog barking)
I'm a scientist.

33:49.260 --> 33:51.581
I don't steal
from my digs.

33:51.630 --> 33:53.586
It was sitting
right here.

33:53.630 --> 33:56.827
We got a warrant. We'll turn
this place upside down.

33:56.860 --> 33:58.396
I doubt they'll
find anything.

33:58.430 --> 34:00.489
She hid it somewhere
after our visit yesterday.

34:00.530 --> 34:02.339
I hope not--
'cause if she did,

34:02.370 --> 34:04.406
we got nothing on her.

34:10.110 --> 34:11.543
We searched her place
from top to bottom.

34:11.580 --> 34:12.842
There's no trace
of the bowl

34:12.880 --> 34:14.518
we think she stole
from the Afghan temple.

34:14.550 --> 34:16.177
Well, it was at her
house yesterday.

34:16.220 --> 34:17.369
Sherlock and I
both saw it.

34:17.420 --> 34:19.081
Well, Ms. Roney says
they're mistaken,

34:19.120 --> 34:21.384
and that she had nothing
to do With the murders

34:21.420 --> 34:23.183
of Clennon or Monroe.

34:23.220 --> 34:24.858
Obviously, our
visit spooked her.

34:24.890 --> 34:26.528
She must have passed
the artifact off

34:26.560 --> 34:27.788
to her coconspirator.

34:27.830 --> 34:29.320
We could check
her cell activity,

34:29.360 --> 34:30.725
see _Which towers
carried her Signal.

34:30.760 --> 34:33.399
That way we'd have
a rough idea where she went.

34:33.430 --> 34:35.466
She spent all night
on two videoconference calls.

34:35.500 --> 34:37.229
15 archaeologists
on two different continents

34:37.270 --> 34:38.464
confirm she wasn't

34:38.510 --> 34:40.660
away from her computer
longer than five minutes.

34:40.710 --> 34:42.473
In all likelihood, her
accomplice came to her,

34:42.510 --> 34:45.172
removed the bowl and all
other incriminating eVIdence.

34:45.210 --> 34:47.849
Yeah, well, without proof,
we don't have much choice.

34:47.880 --> 34:50.212
We have to let her go.

34:51.250 --> 34:52.683
(sighs)

34:56.860 --> 34:59.522
(Buddhist chants playing
over stereo)

35:00.690 --> 35:02.396
(needle scratches record)

35:04.670 --> 35:05.898
I'm giving up on meditation.

35:05.930 --> 35:07.898
Because we haven't figured out

35:07.930 --> 35:10.262
Who Beth Roney's partner is yet?

35:10.300 --> 35:13.201
We've only been at it
for a couple of hours.

35:13.240 --> 35:15.174
We can't even find
any suspects to evaluate.

35:15.210 --> 35:17.474
She seems to have no boyfriend,
no close friends.

35:17.510 --> 35:20.502
To put a finer point on it:
no friends of any sort.

35:20.550 --> 35:23.439
Her every waking hour
is occupied by work.

35:23.480 --> 35:25.482
Mmm, wonder What
that's like.

35:27.250 --> 35:29.286
Where'd that come from?

35:29.320 --> 35:30.753
Oh. The attic.

35:30.790 --> 35:32.519
It's for you.

35:32.560 --> 35:37.350
It is without doubt my most
loathed article of furniture.

35:37.400 --> 35:38.867
I'm touched.

35:38.900 --> 35:40.788
I was thinking about
What you said yesterday

35:40.830 --> 35:42.331
about wanting
to improve yourself.

35:42.370 --> 35:43.598
I support the instinct.

35:43.640 --> 35:45.505
But when _it comes
to investigation,

35:45.540 --> 35:49.328
I cannot restrict myself
to your current pace.

35:49.380 --> 35:51.940
And the trunk
is gonna help me how?

35:51.980 --> 35:54.244
Inside, you
Will find files

35:54.280 --> 35:55.838
on several cold cases.

35:55.880 --> 35:57.643
My cold cases.

35:59.590 --> 36:02.354
They are the handful
of mysteries

36:02.390 --> 36:03.914
in all of my career

36:03.960 --> 36:06.554
Which have eluded
my powers of deduction.

36:06.590 --> 36:09.525
So the next time
you wish to hone your skills

36:09.560 --> 36:13.667
on a solo venture,
I encourage you to peruse them.

36:13.700 --> 36:15.531
I've already given them my all.

36:15.570 --> 36:17.868
Mmm. So there's little risk
that I would arrive

36:17.900 --> 36:19.936
at a solution before you.
(soft chuckle)

36:25.310 --> 36:28.370
You might even succeed
Where I have failed.

36:31.490 --> 36:33.242
Thanks.

36:33.290 --> 36:35.451
Aanay. ..
(clears throat)

36:35.490 --> 36:37.583
these are Detective
Bell's canvass reports.

36:37.620 --> 36:39.622
Useless.

36:39.660 --> 36:41.992
None of Dr. Roney's
neighbors heard or saw

36:42.030 --> 36:45.693
anyone approaching her house
between our two visits.

36:45.730 --> 36:47.721
No one heard anything--

36:47.770 --> 36:50.637
but her partner was there.

36:50.670 --> 36:53.662
Her partner
Who we know is a man.

36:53.710 --> 36:54.836
(barking)

36:54.880 --> 36:57.599
BELL:
You want to get your dog

36:57.640 --> 36:59.642
under control?
No.

36:59.680 --> 37:01.648
I don't.
You're not welcome here.

37:01.680 --> 37:03.272
None of you are.

37:03.320 --> 37:04.514
Well, you
can do it,

37:04.550 --> 37:05.744
or Officer Dunn here can.

37:05.790 --> 37:07.439
It's your choice.

37:07.490 --> 37:08.889
Gotham!

37:08.920 --> 37:10.478
Come on.

37:13.730 --> 37:15.322
(door closes)

37:18.930 --> 37:20.898
So, let me guess.

37:20.930 --> 37:22.898
You have another warrant?

37:22.940 --> 37:26.307
We do-- only this one
is of the "arrest" variety.

37:26.340 --> 37:28.706
(chuckles) What?
BELL:
We've identified

37:28.740 --> 37:31.538
the man who shot
Sam Clennon and James Monroe.

37:31.580 --> 37:33.571
Your ex-husband,
Cameron Hecht.

37:33.610 --> 37:36.613
HOLMES:
We had the right man the
other day, just wrong motive.

37:36.650 --> 37:38.618
He didn't kill your old
partners because of some tryst;

37:38.650 --> 37:40.618
he killed them because
he was your new partner.

37:40.650 --> 37:42.754
That's insane.

37:42.790 --> 37:44.849
I told you, we got divorced

37:44.890 --> 37:46.426
over a year ago.

37:46.460 --> 37:47.859
And then you reconciled.

37:47.890 --> 37:49.721
According to him,
at least.

37:49.760 --> 37:51.728
You talked to Cameron?
HOLMES:
At great length.

37:51.770 --> 37:53.965
You told us he was in Arizona,
but a quick check

37:54.000 --> 37:55.592
of his recent
credit card activity

37:55.640 --> 37:57.733
revealed he was,
in fact, in New York.

37:57.770 --> 37:59.601
He had much the same
look on his face

37:59.640 --> 38:01.676
When we knocked on_his
hotel room door last night.

38:01.710 --> 38:03.405
WATSON: As soon as
we made it clear

38:03.440 --> 38:05.340
how it simple it was
to compare his DNA

38:05.380 --> 38:07.405
to the blood droplets
he left at the captain's house,

38:07.450 --> 38:08.849
he rolled on you.
He told us about

38:08.880 --> 38:10.609
the bowl you stole
and a few other artifacts,

38:10.650 --> 38:11.719
how you thought
you could get

38:11.750 --> 38:13.388
over a million dollars
for them.

38:13.420 --> 38:15.559
How did we think to
look for him, you ask?

38:15.590 --> 38:18.388
Well, you have your femi-Nazi
hound to thank for that.

38:18.430 --> 38:20.386
(barking)
WATSON:
Your neighbors didn't recall

38:20.430 --> 38:22.955
hearing anything unusual
between our two visits,

38:23.000 --> 38:25.423
including the barking
of your dog.

38:25.470 --> 38:27.620
Curious. We know that
your partner was a man,

38:27.670 --> 38:30.059
and that he'd managed
to get in and out

38:30.100 --> 38:32.705
of your home Without
upsetting her.

38:32.740 --> 38:35.777
So was it someone that she
had grown used to over time,

38:35.810 --> 38:39.075
or was it someone that she'd
Simply never forgotten?

38:39.110 --> 38:40.748
BELL:
Beth Roney,

38:40.780 --> 38:42.975
you have the right
to remain silent.

38:43.020 --> 38:44.681
Anything you say

38:44.720 --> 38:47.883
_can and_wil| be used
against you in a court of laW.

38:49.620 --> 38:51.383
(knocking)

38:51.430 --> 38:52.829
Come in.

38:57.700 --> 38:59.725
What's that?

38:59.770 --> 39:01.761
Background check
on Steven Accorsi.

39:01.800 --> 39:03.688
I never gave you his name.

39:03.740 --> 39:05.059
You told me
that he was

39:05.110 --> 39:06.805
a contractor Who'd done
some work on your home,

39:06.840 --> 39:08.808
so I looked at some building
permits that had been issued...

39:08.840 --> 39:11.741
I told you I didn't want you
doing anything about it.

39:11.780 --> 39:13.748
Well, I wanted to help.

39:13.780 --> 39:15.771
Aside from a few
unpaid parking tickets,

39:15.820 --> 39:17.549
your wife's suitor appears to be

39:17.580 --> 39:20.447
above board. Sorry if that's
not What you wanted to hear.

39:20.490 --> 39:21.718
No, you keep that.

39:21.760 --> 39:23.079
I... I don't want it.

39:23.120 --> 39:24.951
(exhales)

39:24.990 --> 39:28.448
Hmm. Your wife is aware that
you didn't like him, correct?

39:28.500 --> 39:30.798
Your feelings were...
clear to her?

39:30.830 --> 39:33.094
Only for the last
30 years, yeah.

39:33.130 --> 39:34.666
Why?

39:34.700 --> 39:37.032
Well, it's just...
interesting, out of...

39:37.070 --> 39:39.038
all the men she
could have entertained,

39:39.070 --> 39:42.779
she chose the one most likely
to elicit a reaction from you.

39:42.810 --> 39:45.108
Maybe she thought I deserved it.

39:45.150 --> 39:46.777
(sighs)

39:46.810 --> 39:48.812
Mmm. Pictures
of you around the house,

39:48.850 --> 39:51.739
it's odd that they're
still on display. No?

39:51.790 --> 39:54.657
Well, we haven't told the kids
about the separation yet.

39:54.690 --> 39:57.409
She's just...
keeping up appearances.

39:59.090 --> 40:02.423
You should know, Captain,
I usually cheer

40:02.460 --> 40:04.052
the end of any marriage.

40:04.100 --> 40:06.762
As an institution, I think
it's outlasted its usefulness

40:06.800 --> 40:08.028
by quite a large...

40:08.070 --> 40:10.061
margin.
Huh.

40:10.100 --> 40:13.968
And yet I've come to appreciate
the premise of partnership.

40:14.010 --> 40:17.036
It's far more intricate_
than I had preVIously imagined.

40:17.080 --> 40:20.902
The very smallest gesture
can speak volumes.

40:20.950 --> 40:23.771
You're telling me
not to give up?

40:23.820 --> 40:25.515
I'm telling you,
you should never have entered

40:25.550 --> 40:26.812
into the charade
that is wedded matrimony.

40:26.850 --> 40:28.886
(laughs softly)

40:29.960 --> 40:32.451
You had a partner.

40:32.490 --> 40:34.799
Perhaps you still do.

40:43.200 --> 40:45.134
(doorbell rings)

40:47.910 --> 40:49.468
(laughing):
Hi.

40:49.510 --> 40:50.909
Who's this?

40:50.940 --> 40:51.838
Hi!

40:51.880 --> 40:53.848
Her name's Gotham.

40:53.880 --> 40:55.916
Her owner's gonna
be away for a while.

40:55.950 --> 40:57.713
But I got to warn you,

40:57.750 --> 40:59.889
she's got a thing
about strange men.

40:59.920 --> 41:02.957
(chuckling): I had to give her
half a roast beef sandwich

41:02.990 --> 41:04.855
to get her in the car.

41:04.890 --> 41:08.826
Oh, doesn't like strange
men-- now I get it.

41:08.860 --> 41:10.657
Hi.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.992
I wanted you to know that...

41:18.770 --> 41:23.207
...I understand that this
separation isn't just some...

41:23.240 --> 41:25.800
waiting period.

41:25.850 --> 41:29.513
I put you in second
position for too long.

41:29.550 --> 41:32.280
And you deserve better.

41:32.320 --> 41:34.982
So I'm gonna work
to give it to you.

41:35.020 --> 41:37.113
I'm not gonna push.

41:37.160 --> 41:40.857
You need space.

41:40.890 --> 41:43.154
I respect that.

41:45.200 --> 41:48.533
But I'm not gonna
throw in the towel.

41:48.570 --> 41:51.061
You take this time,

41:51.100 --> 41:53.568
do What you got to do,

41:53.610 --> 41:56.670
and I'll take it, too.

41:56.710 --> 41:58.200
*

41:58.240 --> 42:01.073
Figure out What
I can do better.

42:05.020 --> 42:07.887
Thank you.

42:07.920 --> 42:10.718
Good night, sweetheart.

42:12.860 --> 42:15.090
*

42:23.040 --> 42:25.634
*
