WEBVTT

00:03.104 --> 00:05.406
RUSH: I may be on
 the verge of discovering

00:05.439 --> 00:09.177
the true nature
 o Destiny's mission.

00:09.210 --> 00:12.213
ELI: You've had
 control of this ship
 the whole time!

00:12.246 --> 00:13.747
Why wouldn't you
 tell anyone?

00:13.781 --> 00:17.185
The Lucian Alliance
 is planning an attack
 on Earth.

00:17.218 --> 00:20.154
YOUNG: I killed Riley.
 I suffocated him
 with my own hands.

00:20.188 --> 00:22.756
You are a good commander.

00:22.790 --> 00:25.259
YOUNG: There is no mission
 other than getting
 these people home.

00:25.293 --> 00:26.494
RUSH: It was never about
 going home,

00:26.527 --> 00:28.396
it's about getting us
 to where we're going.

00:28.429 --> 00:31.765
That is the mission.

00:31.799 --> 00:34.235
How do you know our names?
 You're the Ancestors.

00:34.268 --> 00:36.870
It sounds like ALS,
 Lou Gehrig's Disease.

00:36.904 --> 00:38.406
Hell of a lot of data here.

00:38.439 --> 00:40.908
Yeah, it looks like
 they documented everything.

00:40.941 --> 00:44.044
ELI: We've been searching
 what we were able
 to transfer from the archive.

00:44.078 --> 00:45.679
The ALS cure
 wasn't in there.

00:45.713 --> 00:48.182
JASON: What were those things?
 ELI: A mechanical army
 of drones.

00:48.216 --> 00:50.284
WRAY: We encountered them
 a little while ago.

00:50.318 --> 00:52.052
It seems they've been
 tracking us ever since.

00:52.086 --> 00:53.787
RUSH: This one canister
 alone will last for years.

00:53.821 --> 00:55.889
PARK: For CO2 scrubbing.

00:55.923 --> 00:57.258
BRODY: We'll certainly
 need it with all these
 extra people on board.

00:57.291 --> 00:59.460
CHLOE: Well, it's just
 10 days till we drop them off

00:59.493 --> 01:01.662
with the people
 on the expedition planet.

01:08.001 --> 01:11.805
NOVUS RESIDENT: I'd like to
 thank you all for coming
 to this very special occasion,

01:11.839 --> 01:14.742
the dedication of
 our beautiful new school.

01:14.775 --> 01:17.211
Hey. Do you have
 those calculations?

01:17.245 --> 01:20.314
...laying down the foundation
 for our educations.

01:20.348 --> 01:22.683
That's why this new school
 bears his name.

01:23.851 --> 01:25.319
Bottom left corner.

01:25.353 --> 01:28.322
...do my best to uphold
 his legacy of inquiry...

01:28.356 --> 01:31.225
Here's hoping something
comes of Mr. Brody's
paper-making project.

01:31.259 --> 01:32.025
(CHUCKLES)

01:35.329 --> 01:36.997
Now, please help me welcome...

01:37.030 --> 01:38.832
How many times
 have you watched that?

01:38.866 --> 01:40.268
...two-term mayor...

01:40.301 --> 01:41.335
(PLAYBACK STOPS)

01:41.369 --> 01:44.172
There's no TV.

01:44.205 --> 01:46.340
Look, really, Eli, if you've
 nothing better to do, there's
 far more important things...

01:46.374 --> 01:48.776
I'm adding this footage
 to my documentary.

01:48.809 --> 01:50.511
I think it's important.

01:50.544 --> 01:51.879
Oh, yeah, why's that, then?

01:53.314 --> 01:54.448
They're our descendants.

01:54.482 --> 01:56.049
Not mine. I wasn't there.

01:57.218 --> 01:58.952
Okay, they're still us.

02:00.854 --> 02:02.990
Humans?

02:03.023 --> 02:05.193
I just wish they
 hadn't all left.

02:05.226 --> 02:08.395
I kind of liked the idea
 of having new faces around.

02:09.062 --> 02:11.131
Oh, yeah?

02:11.165 --> 02:13.133
Well, if they really
 did spread all over
 the galaxy,

02:13.167 --> 02:16.036
I would suggest that
the chances of bumping into
them again are pretty high.

02:18.239 --> 02:20.874
Plus, this isn't
 a passenger ship.

02:36.056 --> 02:37.458
What's this?

02:37.491 --> 02:39.860
It's a gas giant.

02:39.893 --> 02:42.230
For some reason,
 Destiny's decided to maneuver
 around a fat gas giant

02:42.263 --> 02:43.264
in order to line up
 with the star.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.634
What's that about?

02:46.667 --> 02:49.169
Well, I'm sure
 Destiny has its reasons.
 It's happened before.

02:49.203 --> 02:50.338
Yeah, but it takes forever.

02:50.371 --> 02:52.240
Are you in a hurry
 to be somewhere?

02:52.273 --> 02:54.542
Well, no, but power reserves
 are still at 40%.

02:54.575 --> 02:57.811
It's as bad
 as my grandfather.

02:57.845 --> 03:00.214
He was always filling
 his Buick at half a tank.

03:00.248 --> 03:01.915
Destiny's kind of
 doing the same thing.

03:03.584 --> 03:05.085
It just struck me as funny.

03:05.118 --> 03:06.920
RUSH: Oh, yeah, that is funny.

03:06.954 --> 03:08.489
That his life and the lives
 of those around him

03:08.522 --> 03:10.090
depended on making it
 to the next gas station.

03:10.123 --> 03:11.559
That's bloody hilarious,
 really.

03:12.893 --> 03:14.828
YOUNG: We there yet?

03:14.862 --> 03:16.129
Thirty seconds from contact.

03:19.467 --> 03:22.169
This is Young.
 We are about to perform
 an aero-braking maneuver.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.937
There may be turbulence.
 Stand by.

03:26.574 --> 03:28.509
Good morning.
 Morning.

03:28.542 --> 03:29.977
You good?
 Tired.

03:52.266 --> 03:54.067
We've got drones,
 dead ahead, a ton of them!

03:54.101 --> 03:55.869
And a command ship.
 What the hell
 are they doing here?

03:55.903 --> 03:57.471
BRODY: Coming right at us.

04:23.196 --> 04:24.298
SCOTT: Where did they
 come from?

04:24.332 --> 04:25.999
Maybe they were here
 all along

04:26.033 --> 04:28.135
and we couldn't see them
 from behind the planet.

04:28.168 --> 04:29.937
Still have a couple of minutes
 or so before we can safely
 go back into FTL.

04:29.970 --> 04:32.239
How soon will they be
 on top of us?
 A couple minutes.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.407
YOUNG: Lieutenant, let's see
 if we can get around them.

04:33.441 --> 04:34.508
Yes, sir.

04:41.214 --> 04:42.983
Sir, the swarm of drones
 and the command ship

04:43.016 --> 04:45.152
are maneuvering to stay
 between us and the star.

04:45.185 --> 04:46.053
Unless you want
 to head right at them...

04:46.086 --> 04:46.820
That is a negative.
 Where the hell is...

04:46.854 --> 04:48.522
ELI: How many of them
 are there?

04:48.556 --> 04:51.158
Oh, I don't know.
 I lost count at about 100.

04:51.191 --> 04:52.926
Can we jam them?
 Drones are 30 seconds out.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.194
I can't jam them
 in 30 seconds.

04:54.227 --> 04:55.563
RUSH: Doesn't matter,
 we can jump soon.

04:55.596 --> 04:57.531
We should just punch through.
 They won't follow us
 into the star.

04:57.565 --> 04:59.032
We're never
 going to make it.
 We need to refuel.

04:59.066 --> 05:00.133
Well, Destiny can choose
 another star.

05:00.167 --> 05:01.702
There's no point
 in fighting
 unless we have to.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.971
Ten seconds to contact.

05:04.004 --> 05:05.673
Lieutenant, go to FTL.
 RUSH: Not for another
 15 seconds.

05:05.706 --> 05:08.041
How is that not close enough?
 SCOTT: They're firing.

05:15.416 --> 05:17.385
Five seconds.
 Lieutenant, stand by.

05:17.418 --> 05:20.921
Yes, sir.
FTL in three, two, one.

05:29.262 --> 05:31.164
This is Young.
 We are clear of the drones.

05:33.266 --> 05:35.002
Okay, what the hell was that?

05:35.035 --> 05:37.137
It's like they were
lying in wait.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.572
Could be we just got unlucky.

05:38.606 --> 05:40.240
You mean they just
 happened to be here?

05:40.273 --> 05:41.542
Well, they have
 to be somewhere.

05:41.575 --> 05:45.212
Yeah, but space
 is really, really big.

05:45.245 --> 05:47.047
RUSH: Look, as far as we know,
 they can only track us

05:47.080 --> 05:50.451
when we activate the stargate,
 so, please,
 let's not overreact.

05:54.121 --> 05:56.957
How about let's
 not under-react?

06:10.270 --> 06:13.073
You don't really think
 it was a coincidence.

06:13.106 --> 06:14.442
Call it wishful thinking
 if you like.

06:14.475 --> 06:17.110
Because you
realize if it's not
a coincidence...

06:17.144 --> 06:19.279
Then we have
 a very big problem.

06:19.312 --> 06:22.015
No. No, no, no,
 we're totally screwed.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.451
This could be it,
 the end of the line.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.052
Yeah, I just said that.

06:27.287 --> 06:29.623
So why do we need
 to find another star?

06:29.657 --> 06:32.392
Destiny will just fly
 towards the nearest
 red dwarf in our path.

06:32.426 --> 06:35.062
RUSH: Which is exactly why
 we shouldn't go to that one.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.366
You think they were
 waiting for us.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.034
Look, we know
 they can't track us,

06:41.068 --> 06:43.236
but it is possible
 that they can predict
 our course.

06:43.270 --> 06:46.239
Meaning, if Destiny
 hadn't plotted that
 time-consuming maneuver...

06:46.273 --> 06:48.041
We would've had to
 fight it out for
 the whole three hours

06:48.075 --> 06:49.309
before we could go to FTL.

06:49.342 --> 06:51.111
Or be forced
 to jump prematurely.

06:51.144 --> 06:52.746
Which would have shredded
 our FTL drive...

06:54.782 --> 06:56.650
We got lucky.

06:56.684 --> 06:59.720
Yeah, we did,
 but we can't count on
 luck a second time.

06:59.753 --> 07:04.692
Plus, we've no option
 but to recharge,
 so we go off the path.

07:14.802 --> 07:16.336
Contacts?

07:16.369 --> 07:17.671
JAMES: Nothing yet.

07:17.705 --> 07:20.407
We're too far out from
the primary for sensors
to pick anything up.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.742
I wouldn't celebrate.

07:21.775 --> 07:24.745
Why did we drop out
so far away?

07:24.778 --> 07:28.448
To make sure that the
 minimum time elapsed before
 we could go back to FTL.

07:28.482 --> 07:31.351
Don't want to run into drones
 with time on the clock.

07:31.384 --> 07:34.522
I still don't understand
 what they want from us.

07:34.555 --> 07:37.257
ELI: It's nothing personal.
 It's what they're programmed
 to do.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.493
Destroy all technology
 other than their own,

07:39.527 --> 07:41.829
and apparently,
 they weren't programmed
 to give up.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.797
A few seconds away from FTL
capability, sir.

07:43.831 --> 07:45.499
YOUNG: Copy that.

07:45.533 --> 07:46.466
ELI: (SIGHING)
 So far so good.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.537
This room needs more chairs.

07:50.571 --> 07:52.806
Here. Please, go ahead.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.808
No, no, that's your...
 What am I, Captain Kirk?

07:54.842 --> 07:56.844
I need to stretch
my legs anyway. Please.

07:57.344 --> 07:58.512
Thank you.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.617
Don't touch anything.

08:03.651 --> 08:05.719
And that's three hours.
 We can jump any time now.

08:05.753 --> 08:08.321
That's good.
 ELI: That's huge.

08:08.355 --> 08:11.224
I mean, I don't want
 to jinx anything
 but I think we might...

08:11.258 --> 08:13.794
(BEEPING)
 Sir, we've got
 a contact down range.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.629
Damn it.
 They headed our way?

08:15.663 --> 08:18.465
SCOTT: Yes, sir,
 multiple drones,
 multiple vectors.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.901
There's a command ship, too,
 holding position between us
 and the star.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.736
It's a blockade.

08:22.770 --> 08:24.237
YOUNG: How long
 before they reach us?
 It doesn't matter.

08:24.271 --> 08:25.472
We can't fight our way
 through this.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.507
Plus, we're running low
 on power anyway.

08:27.541 --> 08:28.676
Lieutenant,
 get us out of here.
 SCOTT: Yes, sir.

08:35.448 --> 08:37.350
So Sergeant Greer
 was bang-on
 in his assessment.

08:37.384 --> 08:39.720
The drones cannot track us,

08:39.753 --> 08:42.590
so instead they've blockaded
 the stars from which
 Desti recharges.

08:42.623 --> 08:45.525
They can't possibly
 be waiting at every star
 in your path.

08:45.559 --> 08:47.728
It doesn't matter.
 They only have to be
 at the next one.

08:47.761 --> 08:49.496
What do you mean?
 RUSH: Well, our reserves
 are such

08:49.529 --> 08:50.931
that we're only going
 to get one more chance.

08:50.964 --> 08:52.165
Systems are shutting down
 all over.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.533
I just lost power
 in the infirmary.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.504
RUSH: Well, fortunately,
 Eli has an idea.

08:57.537 --> 09:00.674
It's absolute insanity,
 and it's the only choice
 we've got.

09:00.708 --> 09:03.443
Don't over-sell it.

09:03.476 --> 09:08.215
(SIGHS) Okay, so the drones
 have figured out our weakness.

09:08.248 --> 09:09.850
Destiny needs to replenish
 its reserves,

09:09.883 --> 09:12.185
and only uses certain kinds
 of stars to do it.

09:12.219 --> 09:15.623
Main sequence,
spectral K or M,
mostly red dwarves.

09:15.656 --> 09:18.458
So we recharge off
another kind of star.
What's so crazy about that?

09:18.491 --> 09:20.928
The only way to make sure
 the drones won't be waiting

09:20.961 --> 09:24.632
is to pick a star that
 Destiny wouldn't fly
 into in a million years.

09:24.665 --> 09:27.300
No, don't tell me.
 Death Star.

09:27.334 --> 09:28.335
(LAUGHS)

09:30.470 --> 09:31.639
Close.

09:31.672 --> 09:32.673
Uh... (GULPS)

09:33.841 --> 09:35.475
A blue supergiant.

09:37.510 --> 09:38.846
Are you kidding me?

09:39.813 --> 09:40.948
We said it was crazy.

09:40.981 --> 09:43.383
Yeah, it's crazy
 times a thousand!

09:43.416 --> 09:46.787
Do you have
 any idea how much heat
 a Class O star puts out?

09:46.820 --> 09:49.256
I'm telling you right now,
 we can't survive something
 like that.

09:49.289 --> 09:51.391
And I never said we would.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.727
Well, then,
 I think it's a very bad plan.

09:53.761 --> 09:56.229
ELI: The shields will hold...
VOLKER: Yeah, which
is terrific, Eli,

09:56.263 --> 09:57.965
except the temperatures
we're talking about

09:57.998 --> 10:01.568
are way outside Destiny's
 life support margins.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.737
A few compartments
 are going to get
 over 400 degrees.

10:03.771 --> 10:08.241
Which is why the majority
 of the crew will go to
 a planet within range,

10:08.275 --> 10:11.011
and a team will stay behind
to manually pilot the ship
through.

10:11.044 --> 10:14.347
Why not just program
 the ship to do it,
 and all of you can go?

10:14.381 --> 10:18.351
Because even if Destiny
 accepted the program,
 which I doubt,

10:18.385 --> 10:21.521
the core systems would
 shut themselves down
 because of the temperature.

10:21.554 --> 10:22.656
Somebody's got
 to stay on board.

10:24.024 --> 10:26.326
And just who gets
 to decide that?

10:26.359 --> 10:28.528
(SIGHS) We use
 the communication stones

10:28.561 --> 10:30.430
and get the most
 qualified people aboard.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.265
The most qualified people
 are already on board.

10:32.299 --> 10:33.801
That's myself and Eli.

10:33.834 --> 10:34.835
You're volunteering
for this?

10:38.505 --> 10:42.509
This is our own lives
 that are on the line.
 You're not even bloody here.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.646
But those kind
of temperatures...

10:46.680 --> 10:48.381
The suits can handle it.

10:48.415 --> 10:51.284
It won't be comfortable,
 but, yeah.

10:51.318 --> 10:54.788
Wait, how do we know there'll
 be a planet orbiting this star
 you're talking about?

10:54.822 --> 10:57.624
Well, there won't be,
 certainly not a habitable one.

10:57.657 --> 11:01.561
But we think there will be
 at least one or two stargates
 in nearby star systems.

11:01.594 --> 11:04.531
Won't an active
stargate attract drones
to the planet we go to?

11:04.564 --> 11:06.967
Eventually, yeah.
 But hopefully not before
 we can gate back.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.736
Hopefully not.

11:08.769 --> 11:11.371
Are we sure the drones won't
 expect us to try this?

11:11.404 --> 11:13.406
It's crazy times a thousand.

11:13.440 --> 11:17.845
I take it back, Eli.
 It's a great plan.

11:17.878 --> 11:20.748
Okay, guys, I'll try to sell
 this idea to homeworld, but
 I'm telling you right now...

11:20.781 --> 11:22.883
David, we're not
 asking permission.

11:22.916 --> 11:26.353
We're informing you. We're
 low on power, and we don't
 have time to screw around.

11:26.386 --> 11:27.587
We're doing this.

11:36.063 --> 11:40.500
If we keep them on the vine,
 we could have smoking
 sundried tomatoes.

11:40.533 --> 11:43.536
Smoking, all right.
 Every plant in here is
 going to burn to the ground.

11:43.570 --> 11:45.773
Well, don't ask me
 why that doesn't
 happen every time.

11:45.806 --> 11:48.942
Well, the EM of
 a Class O star is just
 too intense for the shield

11:48.976 --> 11:52.946
to attenuate over such
 a large transparent surface.

11:52.980 --> 11:55.783
I'm guessing the
 observation deck is not
 the place to be, either.

11:55.816 --> 11:57.785
It'll be like an oven
 in there, too,

11:57.818 --> 12:01.021
but Brody is working on
 refrigerating our original
 hydroponics compartment

12:01.054 --> 12:03.423
so there'll be plants
 to start over.

12:03.456 --> 12:07.694
Start over. Just when we were
 on the verge of being able
 to feed ourselves.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.930
If we just had
 a little more time.

12:09.963 --> 12:14.467
Destiny drops out in
20 minutes, we gate off the
ship 10 minutes after that.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.904
Save what you can,
cross your fingers.

12:21.775 --> 12:24.978
This is Young.
 All personnel to the
 Gate Room for evacuation.

12:25.012 --> 12:26.980
Pack light,
 you will not be gone long.

12:35.622 --> 12:36.857
Did you do that?
 No.

12:41.128 --> 12:42.362
Come on.

12:53.006 --> 12:54.374
Colonel, the bridge
 just locked down.

12:55.943 --> 12:58.812
Understood!
Head to the Gate Room.

12:58.846 --> 13:02.182
I hope we don't have
 to use any bullets.
 We're running low.

13:02.215 --> 13:03.851
Brody'll have to make
 some new ones.

13:03.884 --> 13:04.852
That's time, sir.

13:10.824 --> 13:12.525
Colonel!
 You should be
 in the Gate Room.

13:12.559 --> 13:14.427
There's a third suit.
 We should take advantage
 of it.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.029
Well, Rush said
 he and Eli...

13:16.063 --> 13:17.931
Yeah, there's new hybrids
 in the dome we could
 lose forever.

13:17.965 --> 13:21.001
Medicinals that might help
 T.J. from worlds we'll
 never go back to.

13:21.034 --> 13:23.003
Well, that whole
compartment's going
to go up in flames.

13:23.036 --> 13:25.772
You have to gate off the ship
 while we still have the power
 to dial out.

13:25.805 --> 13:28.541
That leaves more than
 enough time to collect
 as many as I can,

13:28.575 --> 13:30.810
then back up Rush and Eli.

13:30.844 --> 13:32.612
Okay.
 'Cause Rush isn't
 as great as he thinks.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.514
And besides,
 I'm our expert
 on the suits.

13:34.547 --> 13:36.716
I said okay. Good luck.

13:36.749 --> 13:37.885
Okay.

13:45.092 --> 13:47.560
Everyone here?
 Except Rush.

13:47.594 --> 13:50.630
Nice of him to see us off.
 And Dr. Park.

13:50.663 --> 13:53.033
What?
 She volunteered
 to use the third suit.

13:53.066 --> 13:57.070
Didn't even try
 to talk her out of it.
 She can handle herself.

13:57.104 --> 13:59.873
YOUNG: FTL drop-out
 in three, two...

14:07.948 --> 14:10.683
This is Rush.
 We're on direct approach
 to a Class O star,

14:10.717 --> 14:12.685
roughly 24 solar masses.

14:12.719 --> 14:14.187
No drones in sight.

14:14.221 --> 14:15.855
That's good.
 What's our clock?

14:15.889 --> 14:17.590
I can't give you
 a precise time on that.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.993
To be safe, no less
 than seven hours.

14:20.027 --> 14:22.129
Understood, stand by.
 Gates in range?

14:23.296 --> 14:24.797
We got one.

14:25.632 --> 14:26.799
I'll take it. Dial it up.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.202
(DIALING GATE)

15:13.013 --> 15:14.847
Holy crap,
 we dialed Pittsburgh.

15:17.817 --> 15:19.252
Atmosphere
and temperature's good.

15:19.286 --> 15:21.321
It looks like
 a human city, all right.

15:21.354 --> 15:23.823
The archive said
 our people spread out
 from Novus for centuries.

15:23.856 --> 15:27.827
That's enough time for dozens
 of planets to be settled
 with large populations.

15:27.860 --> 15:29.562
They don't seem as advanced.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.898
Depending on resources,
ideology, isolation,

15:31.931 --> 15:33.166
they'd all advance
at different rates.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.602
This has to be one of them.

15:35.635 --> 15:39.139
Make that "used to be."
 Looks abandoned. I'm not
 seeing any indication of life.

15:39.172 --> 15:41.041
Well, we'll find out
 when we get there.
 Lieutenant, move us out.

15:42.142 --> 15:43.876
All right, people, let's go!

15:56.023 --> 15:58.291
Hey, crazy or not,
 it's a hell of a plan.

15:59.892 --> 16:01.161
Thanks.
 Yeah.

16:02.895 --> 16:04.864
I should go suit up,
 help Lisa in the dome.

16:04.897 --> 16:07.167
I'll see you sometime
after 0700.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.736
Ish! We'll dial when
 it's cool enough to come back.

16:26.319 --> 16:29.389
All right, people,
 let's find a spot and relax.

16:29.422 --> 16:30.390
We're going to be
 here for a while.

16:33.260 --> 16:35.395
Well, my gut says
 to stay put and wait it out,

16:35.428 --> 16:37.730
but this could be a gold mine.
 What do you guys think?

16:37.764 --> 16:38.898
Cities have hospitals.

16:38.931 --> 16:40.400
I've been washing
bandages for months.

16:40.433 --> 16:41.968
If we could even
 find a pharmacy...

16:42.001 --> 16:44.337
Or a grocery store.
 Or a gun store.

16:44.371 --> 16:47.240
Thing is, these people
 left for a reason.
 We don't know what.

16:47.274 --> 16:48.875
Have you ever been
 to Pittsburgh?

16:48.908 --> 16:50.743
Hey! I was born there.

16:53.946 --> 16:56.416
I think it's
worth the risk.

16:56.449 --> 16:59.386
All right. We'll go out
in small teams,
light armaments.

16:59.419 --> 17:02.055
Yes, sir.
 Wait, shouldn't we all go?

17:02.089 --> 17:03.323
We'd cover
 more ground that way, sir.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.192
This already goes against
my better judgment.

17:05.224 --> 17:08.194
I want you two to stay put,
and you keep these people
safe, understood?

17:08.228 --> 17:09.262
Yes, sir.

17:09.296 --> 17:10.997
Colonel...
 YOUNG: You, too.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.832
Could hit the fan
 in here just as easily
 as out there.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.201
If we are not back
 in seven hours,

17:14.233 --> 17:15.768
I want you to get everyone
 back on the ship.

17:15.801 --> 17:18.738
No search teams,
 no waiting, okay?

17:18.771 --> 17:20.272
Anything in particular
 you want me to look for?

17:21.308 --> 17:22.742
I'd kill for a new outfit.

17:23.810 --> 17:25.944
I'll keep that in mind.

17:25.978 --> 17:27.314
Good luck.
 Thanks.

17:43.830 --> 17:45.398
We'll head this way.
Be smart.

17:45.432 --> 17:46.933
Yes, sir.

17:57.277 --> 17:58.978
ELI: This was a good idea.

17:59.011 --> 18:02.048
Yeah, I just wanted
 to grab as many
 as we can, you know?

18:02.081 --> 18:03.983
In some ways,
 this garden was
 our biggest accomplishment.

18:04.016 --> 18:05.985
You mean besides the still?

18:06.018 --> 18:09.156
(CHUCKLES) I mean,
 besides staying alive.

18:09.189 --> 18:13.993
You know, I come here
 a lot just to think ever
 since it got repaired.

18:14.026 --> 18:18.765
You know when you lay down
 on the ground and you
 look up at the stars?

18:18.798 --> 18:21.934
My father and I used
 to do that a lot
 when I was a kid.

18:21.968 --> 18:24.337
He taught me
 all the constellations.

 always changing.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.346

Well, time to stop
 doing that. Rush out.

 to grab a few more.
 I'll be right behind you.

 how long they've been gone.

19:12.352 --> 19:15.922
It's hard to say.
Nature can reclaim
a city pretty fast.

 figure out is why
 there's no vehicles.

Don't waste time searching

 anything useful in them.

 I'm going in.

Lieutenant!
 Yeah?

19:36.443 --> 19:38.811
GREER: We should split up,
 go on opposite sides
 of the street.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.980
We'll cover more ground.

19:41.013 --> 19:45.184
Yeah, good idea.
 Brody, Chloe and you two,
 you're with me.

20:04.604 --> 20:06.873
You're not wearing your suit.

20:06.906 --> 20:08.441
Well, there's
 plenty of time before
 we reach the star.

20:08.475 --> 20:10.910
Plus, we can work
 better without them.

20:10.943 --> 20:12.545
Yeah, but now
 I look ridiculous.

20:14.381 --> 20:16.249
Yeah.

Will you double-check
 these figures for me?

Then what?

Well, it's your plan,
you tell me.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.892
I know that,
 I was just asking.

20:25.925 --> 20:26.826
So was I.

20:28.328 --> 20:30.463
I asked first.

20:30.497 --> 20:33.966

 have to know exactly
 what we're doing here.

 for improvisation.

If we get this wrong,
 we've got a very big problem.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.139
Yeah, we'll be dead.

20:40.172 --> 20:42.475

 so how do you want to do this?

 the question.

20:44.811 --> 20:46.946
Oh, bloody hell,
we're all doomed.

20:46.979 --> 20:49.982
What! We pilot the ship
 manually through the star.

20:50.016 --> 20:51.384
That's the plan.
 Who is going to be the pilot,

20:51.418 --> 20:53.520
and who is going
 to be the co-pilot?

20:54.521 --> 20:56.155

 that in the end

that it's going
 to take both of us
 to pull this off,

21:00.593 --> 21:03.330
but only one of us
 should input the actual
 course corrections.

 who that should be.

25:17.216 --> 25:18.184
Go! Go!

25:27.459 --> 25:28.795
(DRONE HUMMING)

25:29.528 --> 25:31.497
Lieutenant?

25:31.530 --> 25:32.732
I hear it,
 but I can't see it.

25:41.373 --> 25:43.409
Colonel, we have what
 appears to be a single
 drone at our position.

25:43.442 --> 25:45.511
Request permission to engage.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.947
That's a negative!
We don't know
how many there are.

25:47.980 --> 25:50.783
Go to radio silence.
 Do not reveal your position.

25:50.817 --> 25:51.818
Young out.

26:18.310 --> 26:20.246
Guys?

26:20.279 --> 26:22.915
Destiny's closed off
 the compartment
 from the rest of the ship,

26:22.949 --> 26:25.785
and for some reason we don't
 understand is refusing
 our override command.

26:25.818 --> 26:27.654
We're working on it,
but in the meantime,

26:27.687 --> 26:29.922
you should put the rest
 of your suit on.

26:29.956 --> 26:31.523
We're only a few minutes out.
 It's gonna start getting
 pretty hot in here.

26:32.491 --> 26:33.292
Okay.

26:36.428 --> 26:39.298
We don't have time for this.
 It was a good idea.

26:39.331 --> 26:40.967
Yeah, well, maybe it was,
 but she took too long,

26:41.000 --> 26:42.802
and now she could
 end up paying the price.

26:51.010 --> 26:52.211
Hey.
 Hey.

26:53.512 --> 26:55.281
Success?

26:55.314 --> 26:58.517
The hospital's probably
in the part of the city
that was taken out.

26:58.550 --> 27:00.787
We found what passed
 for a pharmacy.
 Mostly cleaned out, but...

27:00.820 --> 27:02.689
Why don't you take what
 you've got back to the gate.

27:02.722 --> 27:04.356
It's gonna be dark soon.
 What about Scott
 and Greer's team?

27:04.390 --> 27:06.325
I'll worry about them.
 You guys get going.

27:19.305 --> 27:19.906
What's it doing?

27:21.908 --> 27:24.476
I'm not sure.
 I think it knows we're here.

27:24.510 --> 27:26.746
Are you sure there's
 only one?
 One too many.

27:32.852 --> 27:35.021
Give me a can.
 Give me a can.

28:02.448 --> 28:07.653
Guys? You haven't forgotten
 about me, have you?

28:07.686 --> 28:09.722
We're still working on it.

28:09.756 --> 28:11.858
That's the second time
 Destiny' tried to abort
 our approach,

28:11.891 --> 28:13.760
and the second time
 I've had to override it.

28:13.793 --> 28:16.328
If it lets you do that,
 why won't it let us
 open that damn door?

28:16.362 --> 28:19.531
I don't understand that,
 either.

28:19.565 --> 28:22.568
That's it. I'm going
 down there to try
 to pry the door open.

28:25.938 --> 28:27.706
Dr. Park, this is Rush,
can you hear me?

28:27.740 --> 28:29.108
Yeah, I'm still here.

28:29.141 --> 28:32.511
Now, listen very carefully.

28:32.544 --> 28:36.582
Eli is spending more time
 and energy on your predicament
 than we can afford.

28:36.615 --> 28:37.784
Well, thank you, Eli!

28:37.817 --> 28:38.785
No, no, no,
 you don't understand.

28:38.818 --> 28:42.521
The point is Eli has
to stop worrying about you

28:42.554 --> 28:45.958
and start worrying about
 the more important task
 of flying this ship.

28:45.992 --> 28:47.626
You're what's important!
 Don't listen to him...

28:47.659 --> 28:48.995
RUSH: You're wearing
 the EVA suit.

28:49.028 --> 28:52.131
That should provide you
with enough protection
even inside the dome.

28:52.164 --> 28:54.133
You know that better than me.

28:54.166 --> 28:57.804
You want me to stay in here?
 What about the plants I saved?

28:57.837 --> 29:02.474
Dr. Park, forget about
 the plants and please
 listen to me very carefully.

29:02.508 --> 29:05.744
There's a collection pool
 near the center
 of the compartment.

29:05.778 --> 29:07.980
As long as you're fully
 immersed and secure

29:08.014 --> 29:10.817
during the transition
 through the star then
 the water should provide

29:10.850 --> 29:13.385
enough protection
to see you through.

29:13.419 --> 29:14.686
Do you really think
 that's going to work?

29:15.754 --> 29:17.356
I promise you it will.

29:18.958 --> 29:20.392
Look, I'm sorry,
but there's really
no other way.

29:20.426 --> 29:21.794
Rush out.

29:24.696 --> 29:26.498
Son of a bitch.

29:29.535 --> 29:30.803
She'll be fine.

29:52.892 --> 29:55.995
It was probably drawn in
 by the stargate
 activation at first.

29:56.028 --> 29:57.696
Then it picked up
 our radio signals.

29:57.729 --> 30:01.033
Whatever. We can't stay.

30:01.067 --> 30:02.568
Sooner or later,
 we've got to make a move.

30:03.535 --> 30:04.536
Listen!

30:04.570 --> 30:06.005
(SECOND DRONE APPROACHING)

30:13.145 --> 30:15.014
(DRONE FLIES OVERHEAD)

30:15.047 --> 30:19.852
Do you hear that?
 They're coming!

30:19.886 --> 30:22.588
Everybody stay still
 and stay quiet.

30:24.523 --> 30:25.992
(DRONES HUMMING)

30:32.064 --> 30:34.000
There's two of them
 out there now.

30:34.033 --> 30:36.802
Bet there's a lot more left
over after the attack.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.570
Probably scattered
 all over the planet.

30:38.604 --> 30:40.907
What are we going to do?
 I don't know, but...

30:46.112 --> 30:50.216
Okay, it's made
 the Lieutenant's position.

30:50.249 --> 30:52.851
When I start firing,
 you run.

31:16.808 --> 31:18.177
What are you doing?
 This thing is showing

31:18.210 --> 31:19.778
two other planets in range.

31:19.811 --> 31:22.548
Yeah, but only this one's
 in range of Destiny.

31:22.581 --> 31:24.616
Well, I'm not going
 to sit around here
 waiting to get killed.

31:24.650 --> 31:26.052
(DIALING GATE)

31:26.085 --> 31:27.719
Hey! What are you doing?

31:28.754 --> 31:29.755
Getting the hell...

31:38.998 --> 31:41.233
This is James.
 Morrison tried
 dialing the stargate,

31:41.267 --> 31:42.501
but I think
 I stopped him in time.

31:42.534 --> 31:44.903
Negative, negative.
One of the drones
is now headed your way.

31:44.937 --> 31:45.938
Stay off your radio and...

32:08.360 --> 32:09.161
Get out of there!

32:48.700 --> 32:50.569
Thanks for
 the backup, sir.
 All good.

32:54.173 --> 32:56.175
Come on, we should
 get out of the open.

33:00.079 --> 33:01.247
You found something?
 YOUNG: Let's move!

33:14.326 --> 33:16.795
(ALARM BLARING)

33:16.828 --> 33:18.764
I get it, you don't want
 to do this! Can we shut
 that off, please?

33:20.232 --> 33:21.033
(ALARM STOPS)

33:22.034 --> 33:23.902
Thank you.

33:23.935 --> 33:25.871
Navigation systems
 are beginning to shut
 themselves down.

33:27.173 --> 33:29.808
You now have
 full manual control.

33:29.841 --> 33:31.610
Got it.
 Our approach is good.

33:37.283 --> 33:41.353
Mean interior temperature
 just passed 150 degrees
 Fahrenheit and rising.

33:41.387 --> 33:43.822
What if Destiny locked down
 that compartment

33:43.855 --> 33:46.758
and wouldn't let us override
 because it knew that the dome

33:46.792 --> 33:48.860
couldn't sustain the stress
 of going through the star?

33:51.963 --> 33:53.199
You already thought of that.

33:53.232 --> 33:55.201
I considered
 the possibility, yes.

33:55.234 --> 33:57.336
You told her she'd be fine.

33:57.369 --> 34:00.106
And I still believe that,
 but only if you do what
 you're here to do

34:00.139 --> 34:02.208
and stop worrying
 about something you
 can do nothing about!

34:03.142 --> 34:04.276
(EXPLOSION)

34:08.214 --> 34:09.215
Damn!

34:41.347 --> 34:42.813
(DRONE APPROACHES OVERHEAD)

34:49.955 --> 34:53.225
This is James.
 We've got a drone
 at the front door.

34:53.259 --> 34:55.393
Damn it, L.T.,
 I said to stay off your radio.

34:55.427 --> 34:57.763
They are drawn to the signal!

34:57.796 --> 34:59.431
Yes, sir.
I'm counting on it.

35:24.890 --> 35:27.125
Nice shot.
Thank you.

35:28.360 --> 35:31.129
Anyone hurt?
 JAMES: Yeah, Morrison.

35:31.163 --> 35:32.198
I broke his nose.

36:22.214 --> 36:23.882
Okay, we're in the star!

36:23.915 --> 36:26.885
Shields are holding.
 Activating collectors.

36:28.053 --> 36:28.954
We're going in too steep.

36:30.956 --> 36:32.858
Variance is nominal,
 you're doing fine.

36:32.891 --> 36:34.860
The magnetic fluctuations
 are way greater
 than I predicted.

36:34.893 --> 36:36.495
I'm not sure I can
 stay ahead of it.
 You can do this.

36:36.528 --> 36:38.196
I don't know why
I ever thought I could!

36:38.230 --> 36:40.031
I know you can.
 There are too many variables!

36:40.065 --> 36:42.067
Eli! You're the only one
 who can!

36:58.917 --> 37:01.119
SCOTT: Sure this is
 the right way, sir?
 YOUNG: It's a shortcut.

37:01.152 --> 37:03.021
GREER: Are you sure?
 YOUNG: It's the one
 I took to find you.

37:03.054 --> 37:03.989
Yes, I'm sure.

37:11.997 --> 37:13.599
RUSH: Reserves are
 at maximum capacity.

37:14.500 --> 37:16.402
Retracting collectors.

37:16.435 --> 37:19.571
We're pulling out,
 entering the photosphere.

37:19.605 --> 37:22.641
Sub-light drives
 are at full power!

37:22.674 --> 37:24.343
We've done it!
 Almost.

37:44.363 --> 37:45.597
(SCREAMING)

37:49.200 --> 37:52.170
We did it.
We made it through.

37:52.203 --> 37:56.107
Mean interior temperature,
 310 degrees.

37:56.141 --> 37:59.411
Oh, is that all?
 (LAUGHING)

37:59.445 --> 38:02.247
I should start cooling
 the Gate Room first.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.148
They could be back...
 (BEEPING)

38:08.387 --> 38:10.956
What?
 The hydroponic dome's
 been breached.

38:14.025 --> 38:15.527
Eli!

38:15.561 --> 38:18.364
WRAY: This was printed
 on the third day
 of the attack.

38:18.397 --> 38:21.467
The plan was to move
 the stargate from a place
 they called Terminus

38:21.500 --> 38:24.169
to an older part
 of the city.
 I guess here.

38:24.202 --> 38:26.372
No technology
 to attract them.

38:26.405 --> 38:29.107
WRAY: From what I can
make out, volunteers
were driving vehicles

38:29.140 --> 38:32.444
away from the city
 to draw the drones.

38:32.478 --> 38:33.979
Save as many people
 as they could.

38:37.416 --> 38:39.385
Sir, welcome back.

38:39.418 --> 38:41.286
Nice work, Lieutenant.

38:41.319 --> 38:44.155
Varro's the one
who fired the shot.

38:44.189 --> 38:46.492
Well, let's just get
 out of here before
 more show up.

38:46.525 --> 38:47.659
Half hour to go.

38:50.061 --> 38:51.963
How is that not close enough?

38:51.997 --> 38:53.198
What's in the bag?

38:53.231 --> 38:55.200
Hopefully that
 is your new outfit.

38:55.233 --> 38:59.405
I couldn't find a gun store
 or a grocery store,
 but I found a dry cleaner.

39:11.617 --> 39:15.053
Lisa, come in!
Lisa, it's Eli,

39:15.086 --> 39:17.355
I'm outside,
can you hear me?

39:17.389 --> 39:19.958
I'm at the door!
 The compartment's vented.

39:21.427 --> 39:24.062
Rush, did you hear that?
 Yes, yes.

39:24.095 --> 39:25.964
We're through the star.
 I may be able to override.

39:29.300 --> 39:30.201
Are you secure?

39:31.470 --> 39:32.270
Ready!

39:35.140 --> 39:36.475
Take my hand!

39:54.660 --> 39:57.395
I got you.
 You're okay.

39:57.429 --> 40:00.766
(SOBBING) Eli, I can't see!

40:10.108 --> 40:12.243
(RUMBLING)

40:16.347 --> 40:18.083
It sounds different
 than before.

40:18.116 --> 40:19.818
I don't much like
 the difference.

40:19.851 --> 40:22.488
Dial the gate.
 No, we're 10 minutes
 too soon.

40:22.521 --> 40:24.022
YOUNG: Close enough!

40:25.757 --> 40:27.358
(DIALING GATE)

41:21.212 --> 41:23.849
(EXCLAIMS)
 It's hot in here.
 You're 10 minutes early.

41:23.882 --> 41:25.851
We didn't have
 much of a choice.

41:25.884 --> 41:28.219
Lieutenant Johansen,
 there's a patient waiting
 for you in the infirmary.

41:28.253 --> 41:29.721
Eli's with her now.
 What happened?

41:29.755 --> 41:31.823
Flash blindness.
Hopefully it's temporary.

41:33.659 --> 41:34.492
But otherwise?

41:35.426 --> 41:37.829
Eli got us through.

41:37.863 --> 41:40.331
I kept checking
 his calculations
 looking for a mistake,

41:40.365 --> 41:41.432
but there wasn't any.

41:43.535 --> 41:47.639
It was genius.
 I've never seen
 anything like it.

41:47.673 --> 41:50.676
Please don't tell him
 I told you that.
 He might have to do it again.

41:50.709 --> 41:52.477
The drones aren't
 going to fall for
 that trick again.

41:52.510 --> 41:55.346
Plus, the star's
 extremely rare,
 so the chance of...

41:55.380 --> 41:58.416
So we're back
 to where we started.

41:58.449 --> 42:02.220
Well, not exactly.
 At least we've got
 a full tank of gas.

42:04.389 --> 42:05.190
Yay.
 Yay.
