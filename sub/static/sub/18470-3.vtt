00:25.720 --> 00:28.710
And that's another six for Leo Henderson.

00:28.760 --> 00:32.840
Lower Pampling Panthers are now 94 for 3.

00:35.720 --> 00:38.160
Leo is batting like a god.

00:43.280 --> 00:45.990
Another boundary there!

00:46.040 --> 00:49.080
- He's going to win the game!
- Don't curse it.

00:50.120 --> 00:52.720
Panthers are at 98 for 3.

00:53.760 --> 00:56.270
He needs to score a four or they're out.

00:56.320 --> 00:58.910
Do you think he'll do it?

01:00.400 --> 01:02.990
Badger's Drift have bowled well today

01:03.040 --> 01:07.120
but the Panthers' star batsman
has hit them all over the park.

01:19.120 --> 01:23.070
And the Panthers have done it!
Congratulations to Lower Pampling.

01:23.120 --> 01:25.830
They meet Morton Shallows Sharks
in the mid-week semi-final.

01:25.880 --> 01:28.630
Well done! Jolly good show!

01:29.680 --> 01:34.430
Today's man of the match
is of course Leo Henderson!

01:34.480 --> 01:36.750
Leo! Leo!

01:36.800 --> 01:39.910
Thank you all for coming today
for this, the first ever

01:39.960 --> 01:42.990
Midsomer County Premier League C-10 Slam!

01:43.040 --> 01:44.710
Yes!

01:44.760 --> 01:47.670
Charity buckets are at the exits.

01:47.720 --> 01:50.840
Please give generously to the
Causton Heroes Benevolent Fund.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.740
What the hell were you playing at?

02:21.800 --> 02:24.070
What are you doing here?

02:25.800 --> 02:28.800
Have you come to tell me how great I am?

02:29.600 --> 02:31.600
Well, what is it?

03:51.000 --> 03:52.990
Ladies and gentlemen...

03:53.040 --> 03:55.950
Ladies and gentlemen,
please remain in your seats.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.940
Play will resume as soon as possible.

04:02.160 --> 04:04.160
This way, sir.

04:08.240 --> 04:10.910
Leo Henderson. Local quantity surveyor

04:10.960 --> 04:13.030
and captain of the Lower
Pampling Panthers.

04:13.080 --> 04:14.830
His team just made it through

04:14.880 --> 04:17.190
to the semi-finals of
the Midsomer C-10 Slam.

04:17.240 --> 04:19.230
C-10?

04:19.279 --> 04:22.670
It's a ten-overs-a-side game.
Originated in Australia.

04:22.720 --> 04:25.470
It's staged all week culminating
in a grand final on Sunday.

04:25.520 --> 04:27.190
And what do the winners get?

04:27.240 --> 04:30.470
A chance to play in the bigger,
prestigious Australian version.

04:30.520 --> 04:33.260
Sounds like a prize worth winning.

04:34.040 --> 04:36.030
Anything on time of death?

04:36.080 --> 04:38.990
He died less than an hour ago apparently.

04:39.040 --> 04:41.030
That was turned up to maximum.

04:41.080 --> 04:45.910
20 rock-hard balls were bowled
at top speed straight at him.

04:45.960 --> 04:48.150
If at first you don't succeed...

04:48.200 --> 04:50.190
John?

04:50.240 --> 04:52.240
Sarah?

04:56.480 --> 04:59.150
I need to get my
sixth-formers back to school.

04:59.200 --> 05:01.070
This is an odd history lesson.

05:01.120 --> 05:04.230
I don't suppose you picked up on anything?

05:04.280 --> 05:06.270
No. I was too busy enjoying the game.

05:06.320 --> 05:08.790
Although I could tell it
wasn't everyone's cup of tea.

05:08.840 --> 05:11.670
A fair few didn't stay till the end.

05:11.720 --> 05:13.310
Do you know who it is yet?

05:13.360 --> 05:15.190
Leo Henderson.

05:15.240 --> 05:17.190
Oh, no, that's awful.

05:17.240 --> 05:18.950
You know him?

05:19.000 --> 05:22.550
Well, he single-handedly won
the match for Lower Pampling.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.940
Right, I'll see you later.

05:28.800 --> 05:32.200
Will she be going on
the incident board, sir?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.990
Who found the body?

05:35.040 --> 05:37.510
He's over here.

05:37.560 --> 05:39.430
Lower Pampling's 12th man.

05:39.480 --> 05:42.780
He said he went in to
put some things away.

05:43.120 --> 05:45.110
One Jack Morris.

05:45.160 --> 05:48.160
I wonder if I might have a word, Mr M...

05:49.400 --> 05:50.940
.. Morris?

05:52.680 --> 05:54.350
Call me Jack.

05:55.800 --> 05:59.950
Winter, talk to... the team
manager and Leo's teammates.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.990
See if there was any friction
out there on the field.

06:03.040 --> 06:04.950
And afterwards talk to his wife.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
Establish whether he had
any enemies outside cricket.

06:09.480 --> 06:11.480
Now would be good.

06:13.720 --> 06:15.720
Yes, sir.

06:18.480 --> 06:21.350
Would you like to come with me, sir?

06:24.040 --> 06:25.830
I really don't know.

06:25.880 --> 06:27.190
Leo played a blinder

06:27.240 --> 06:28.790
but apart from a bit of sledging,

06:28.840 --> 06:30.950
Badger's Drift took the defeat well.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.510
I'm sorry. Wade McMaster.
I'm the team manager.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.830
Just trying to establish
if anything went on

06:36.880 --> 06:38.710
between the teams after the game.

06:38.760 --> 06:42.030
Obviously, no-one likes to lose
but it would be pretty extreme.

06:42.080 --> 06:43.630
There wasn't any animosity?

06:43.680 --> 06:46.150
No, this may be a different
version of cricket

06:46.200 --> 06:48.190
but the core values remain the same.

06:48.240 --> 06:51.310
A game played by gentlemen.

06:51.360 --> 06:54.270
Leo was a big influence on the team.

06:54.320 --> 06:57.420
I don't know how we'll recover from this.

07:02.540 --> 07:04.150
This is different.

07:04.200 --> 07:06.200
Just a little.

07:07.800 --> 07:10.310
Jack Morris?

07:10.360 --> 07:14.060
My old games master at
school, taught me cricket.

07:16.800 --> 07:19.470
When you found Mr Henderson,
did you touch anything?

07:19.520 --> 07:21.470
I'm sure you know me better than that.

07:21.520 --> 07:24.200
I thought I did... Mr Morris.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.540
New interview room? I like it.

07:35.680 --> 07:37.710
Would you prefer to go to the station?

07:37.760 --> 07:41.480
You know I'm not involved.
All I did was find the body.

07:42.520 --> 07:44.710
Why are you here, Jones?

07:44.760 --> 07:46.750
Tricky question.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.550
And you know I'd tell you if I could.

07:49.600 --> 07:53.830
You turn up in Midsomer and you
don't think to get in contact?

07:53.880 --> 07:56.790
- It's awkward.
- Because you're working?

07:56.840 --> 08:00.550
All I'm doing is renting a room
off a distant family friend.

08:00.600 --> 08:02.510
Whatever it is you're really up to,

08:02.560 --> 08:04.950
it can't get in the way
of my investigation.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.110
I'm just here to take in some cricket.

08:07.160 --> 08:09.700
Hopefully get a game if I can.

08:10.280 --> 08:13.430
We both know you're
here for more than that.

08:13.480 --> 08:16.470
But this murder takes
priority at all times.

08:16.520 --> 08:19.350
And if you come across
anything connected to it,

08:19.400 --> 08:21.400
you have to tell me.

08:24.280 --> 08:26.550
Sure.

08:26.600 --> 08:28.600
Thank you.

08:30.200 --> 08:32.309
I know this is difficult, Mrs Henderson,

08:32.360 --> 08:34.870
but I do need to ask you
just a few more questions.

08:34.919 --> 08:37.710
Only, we are treating
this as a suspicious death.

08:37.760 --> 08:39.750
Oh, my God.

08:39.799 --> 08:42.990
Did you have much contact with
Leo after he won the match?

08:43.039 --> 08:45.030
Erm...

08:45.080 --> 08:47.070
N-No.

08:47.120 --> 08:50.470
He was with his teammates.
I was in the members' area.

08:50.520 --> 08:53.620
Can you think of anyone that disliked him?

08:55.480 --> 08:58.780
I'm not sure there was
anything to dislike.

08:59.680 --> 09:01.950
Thank you for your time.

09:06.320 --> 09:08.310
Can I see Mel?

09:08.360 --> 09:10.270
Sorry. I'm Serena Luthando.

09:10.320 --> 09:12.070
We've been friends since we were kids.

09:12.120 --> 09:15.630
I think she'd appreciate that.
I know you've given a statement

09:15.680 --> 09:18.990
but can you think of anyone
that held a grudge against Leo?

09:19.040 --> 09:22.870
Well, I know half the village
are up in arms about C-10.

09:22.920 --> 09:26.110
There were even threats sent
to Leo and Elliot, my husband.

09:26.160 --> 09:28.670
- What sort of threats?
- Just emails.

09:28.720 --> 09:31.950
We didn't tell Mel. We didn't
see the point in worrying her.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
OK. Thank you.

09:35.800 --> 09:38.230
Oh, Mel, I'm so sorry!

09:38.280 --> 09:40.280
I'm so, so sorry.

09:51.480 --> 09:53.270
I could use a drink.

09:53.320 --> 09:55.470
Yeah, I think we all could.

09:55.520 --> 09:57.510
Kia's over there.

09:57.560 --> 10:00.660
I'll bring the drinks over. On the house.

10:04.600 --> 10:06.790
Just so you know, Fitz. You're out.

10:06.840 --> 10:10.540
What? I kept my end of
the bargain. You saw that.

10:17.400 --> 10:20.920
- I can't believe
what's happened. - Yeah.

10:22.960 --> 10:24.960
Are you OK?

10:30.000 --> 10:31.910
SOCO dusted the bowling
machine for prints.

10:31.960 --> 10:33.910
Nothing, wiped clean.

10:33.960 --> 10:35.950
Also his wife and teammates all check out.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.110
I'm hoping you had better
luck with Jack Morris.

10:38.160 --> 10:40.150
His alibi checks out, Jones.

10:40.200 --> 10:43.110
I'm Winter, sir.

10:43.160 --> 10:46.160
Let's see what Mr Luthando can tell us.

10:48.120 --> 10:51.350
This C-10 competition has
clearly upset someone.

10:51.400 --> 10:54.710
What did they send to Leo Henderson?

10:54.760 --> 10:58.790
It was pretty basic. It just
said, "You're a disgrace."

10:58.840 --> 11:01.030
And that was mailed from the same account?

11:01.080 --> 11:03.070
Yeah, it was.

11:03.120 --> 11:07.030
StopC-10@big-browsemail.co.uk

11:07.080 --> 11:09.070
Thank you.

11:09.120 --> 11:11.110
I thought it was just nonsense.

11:11.160 --> 11:13.750
I'll get Tech to take a look at it.

11:13.800 --> 11:16.550
Tell me, Mr Luthando, how did
you get involved in C-10?

11:16.600 --> 11:18.390
Ah.

11:18.440 --> 11:22.150
I saw it in Australia.
I bought the franchise.

11:22.200 --> 11:24.710
There's never been anything
like this in Midsomer.

11:24.760 --> 11:27.190
The healthy crowd suggests
it's going to be popular.

11:27.240 --> 11:29.190
And it doesn't eat into your life

11:29.240 --> 11:31.430
like five days of dreary test cricket.

11:31.480 --> 11:35.910
Some would argue that the beauty
of cricket is its gentle pace.

11:37.800 --> 11:39.800
Excuse me.

11:41.320 --> 11:44.150
You're kidding.

11:44.200 --> 11:45.710
Not today?

11:45.760 --> 11:49.270
- Mr Luthando?
- Unbelievable.

11:49.320 --> 11:52.620
A referendum. To try
and ban the C-10 Slam.

11:53.400 --> 11:56.350
The council are asking the
entire village to vote on it.

11:56.400 --> 11:58.550
Who runs the council?

11:58.600 --> 12:01.510
Two dinosaurs, Germaine
Troughton and St John Beachwood.

12:01.560 --> 12:03.510
Would that be the same Germaine Troughton

12:03.560 --> 12:05.230
who used to captain England Ladies?

12:05.280 --> 12:07.270
Mm.

12:07.320 --> 12:09.390
As the old girl lives and almost breathes.

12:09.440 --> 12:12.990
She's against C-10, I take it?

12:13.040 --> 12:17.200
Want to know who sent these
threats? I'd start with her.

12:18.280 --> 12:19.920
Mm.

12:29.520 --> 12:32.550
- Mr Morris.
- Hello.

12:32.600 --> 12:34.200
Again.

12:35.240 --> 12:36.710
What can I help with now?

12:36.760 --> 12:38.950
We're actually looking
for Germaine Troughton,

12:39.000 --> 12:42.750
who I presume is the distant
family friend you mentioned.

12:42.800 --> 12:44.800
That, she is.

12:46.160 --> 12:49.880
I was just nipping out, so...
I'll tell her you're here.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.400
Him again.

13:05.240 --> 13:07.230
I'll be back later.

13:07.280 --> 13:09.550
Do try hanging your jacket
up when you get back.

13:09.600 --> 13:11.590
It's what the hooks are for.

13:11.640 --> 13:13.840
Will you come this way?

13:18.600 --> 13:21.870
Tell me, Mrs Troughton, do
you know anything about these?

13:21.920 --> 13:24.630
Absolutely not. Who
were they addressed to?

13:24.680 --> 13:26.670
Elliot Luthando.

13:26.720 --> 13:30.750
But, more importantly,
one went to Leo Henderson.

13:30.800 --> 13:34.030
We heard you were very
much against the C-10.

13:34.080 --> 13:36.910
And I told Elliot and Leo to their faces

13:36.960 --> 13:38.510
exactly what I think.

13:38.560 --> 13:41.310
I do not hide behind threatening emails.

13:41.360 --> 13:44.990
I've got a referendum that's
gonna put a stop to all this.

13:45.040 --> 13:47.030
Oh, that was your idea?

13:47.080 --> 13:50.190
St John and I have listened
to a lot of complaints.

13:50.240 --> 13:52.790
Anyone specific spring to mind?

13:52.840 --> 13:55.880
Too many to mention. Hence the referendum.

13:56.920 --> 14:00.150
You enjoyed an illustrious cricket career.

14:00.200 --> 14:02.790
And yet now you want to ban it?

14:02.840 --> 14:06.390
Don't you want to keep
village cricket alive?

14:06.440 --> 14:10.150
Chief Inspector, C-10 is not
the future of village cricket.

14:10.200 --> 14:13.360
It would be the death of it.

14:49.200 --> 14:51.190
Mel.

14:51.240 --> 14:53.310
Hi, Jack.

14:53.360 --> 14:54.990
I meant to come and see you earlier.

14:55.040 --> 14:57.030
How are you?

14:57.080 --> 14:59.070
Still dazed. Can't take it in.

14:59.120 --> 15:01.110
I'm not sure any of us can.

15:01.160 --> 15:04.440
Leo was one of the good
guys. I liked him a lot.

15:09.760 --> 15:12.760
Sounds like you've already got company.

15:38.360 --> 15:40.360
Hello?

15:52.600 --> 15:54.600
Hello?

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
Ah!

16:05.280 --> 16:07.270
Jack!

16:07.320 --> 16:09.470
He went through there.

16:36.800 --> 16:38.590
I have good news.

16:38.640 --> 16:41.430
Leo is dead.

16:41.480 --> 16:43.620
You can come back now.

16:51.680 --> 16:54.470
Is there anywhere I won't
find you in Lower Pampling?

16:54.520 --> 16:55.990
How's Melody?

16:56.040 --> 16:59.190
Mrs Henderson's still pretty shaken up.

16:59.240 --> 17:02.150
Did she mention to you that
anything had been taken?

17:02.200 --> 17:05.109
She had a look around, but
there's nothing missing.

17:05.160 --> 17:09.069
You must be pretty er...
fit playing cricket.

17:09.119 --> 17:10.510
I work at it.

17:10.560 --> 17:12.630
Not enough to catch the thief, though.

17:12.680 --> 17:15.430
Not for want of trying.

17:15.480 --> 17:18.230
- Seems odd.
- Explain "odd".

17:18.280 --> 17:21.230
Well, you're probably fitter
than the average man or woman

17:21.280 --> 17:23.829
and yet you couldn't keep up.

17:23.880 --> 17:25.750
Well, maybe they play cricket as well.

17:25.800 --> 17:27.790
Maybe.

17:27.839 --> 17:30.150
How well did you know Leo Henderson?

17:30.200 --> 17:32.310
- How is that relevant?
- I'm curious.

17:32.360 --> 17:35.350
- I've already discussed this.
- Not with me.

17:35.400 --> 17:37.670
I've been here a couple of months.

17:37.720 --> 17:39.430
I got to know him pretty well.

17:39.480 --> 17:42.670
He was a great captain
and a great batsman.

17:42.720 --> 17:45.630
OK. Well, if anything
else springs to mind.

17:45.680 --> 17:47.280
It won't.

17:48.600 --> 17:50.040
OK.

17:58.560 --> 18:00.190
Fetch, then.

18:00.240 --> 18:03.830
Your investigation won't stop
the C-10 competition, will it?

18:03.880 --> 18:05.950
Nice to know where your priorities lie.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.550
Sounds like Daddy's got a tough case.

18:08.600 --> 18:11.790
Sorry. It's more something
odd happened yesterday.

18:11.840 --> 18:16.110
- Came out of the blue. - Do you
need to talk about it? - It'll keep.

18:16.160 --> 18:18.710
Just as well. We need to get moving.

18:18.760 --> 18:20.950
See you later.

18:26.040 --> 18:28.980
Disappointingly, not a traditionalist.

18:32.760 --> 18:34.630
So the impact of the first ball

18:34.680 --> 18:36.630
knocked Leo Henderson unconscious,

18:36.680 --> 18:38.750
and he fell backwards into the netting.

18:38.800 --> 18:41.110
Then more cricket balls were fired at him

18:41.160 --> 18:43.950
and one of them hit his heart
full on and stopped it dead.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.990
Sounds a bit gratuitous.

18:46.040 --> 18:48.030
Or someone in a rage.

18:48.080 --> 18:50.080
Thanks, Kam.

18:54.920 --> 18:58.110
Kam, have you got a minute?

18:58.160 --> 19:00.270
- What is it?
- Probably nothing.

19:00.320 --> 19:01.790
But...

19:01.840 --> 19:03.710
Barnaby doesn't seem that bothered

19:03.760 --> 19:06.030
but everywhere I turn, I
bump into Jack Morris.

19:06.080 --> 19:09.630
Is that the good-looking
one who found the body?

19:09.680 --> 19:11.350
Good-looking?

19:11.400 --> 19:14.310
That's what the girls in SOCO were saying.

19:14.360 --> 19:16.430
If you're worried about
it, talk to Barnaby.

19:16.480 --> 19:19.030
Every time I do, he closes it down.

19:19.080 --> 19:22.990
That guy checked out. You're
seeing things that aren't there.

19:23.040 --> 19:26.670
Right. Well, I think that
concludes this month's meeting.

19:26.720 --> 19:30.470
If I can just remind
everyone to cast their votes

19:30.520 --> 19:32.750
on the future of C-10.

19:32.800 --> 19:34.790
St John?

19:34.840 --> 19:37.150
We will announce the result
on the day of the final.

19:37.200 --> 19:38.540
Mm-hm.

19:39.600 --> 19:41.070
Mr Luthando.

19:41.120 --> 19:43.430
I have something for your agenda.

19:43.480 --> 19:45.750
What happened to respect?

19:46.440 --> 19:50.630
The minute Leo dies, you
call for a referendum.

19:50.680 --> 19:53.390
It's just a matter of... bad timing.

19:53.440 --> 19:55.390
Or good timing.

19:55.440 --> 19:57.830
I don't quite follow, Mr McMaster.

19:57.880 --> 20:01.270
People are gonna feel
very uneasy about C-10 now.

20:01.320 --> 20:03.710
You couldn't have got
worse publicity for it.

20:03.760 --> 20:05.510
We merely sit on the council.

20:05.560 --> 20:08.390
Our stance is completely impartial.

20:08.440 --> 20:12.110
I've got a question. Why do you
hate C-10 so much, St John?

20:12.160 --> 20:17.430
As I said, and clearly I
thought, we are impartial.

20:17.480 --> 20:20.510
- I'm not talking about
"we", but "you". - Calm down.

20:20.560 --> 20:24.110
Look, if you're gonna vote for something,

20:24.160 --> 20:25.830
vote for Leo.

20:25.880 --> 20:27.910
He loved this game.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.150
Please.

20:30.200 --> 20:33.000
Please... don't let it die.

20:41.680 --> 20:43.990
I checked Leo's finances. There's no will,

20:44.040 --> 20:46.110
and his life insurance is pretty basic.

20:46.160 --> 20:47.750
So he wasn't killed for money.

20:47.800 --> 20:49.710
That's where it gets confusing.

20:49.760 --> 20:52.230
I found a receipt for a
first-class luxury cruise.

20:52.280 --> 20:54.790
I called up the travel agency
to check and they confirmed

20:54.840 --> 20:57.950
that Leo paid for the trip
in cash. £10,000 give or take.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.390
But there's been no withdrawal
from his accounts for that amount?

21:01.440 --> 21:04.430
No, sir. There's nothing to tell
us where that money came from.

21:04.480 --> 21:07.020
Then I wonder if his wife can.

21:09.760 --> 21:13.560
It's over. They're not gonna
vote for C-10 now, are they?

21:14.840 --> 21:17.150
Enough of that. We play on, Elliot.

21:17.200 --> 21:18.870
You haven't even got a captain.

21:18.920 --> 21:21.150
Yes, we do, sis. Fitz.

21:21.200 --> 21:22.590
Me?

21:22.640 --> 21:24.190
Do it for Leo.

21:24.240 --> 21:27.070
- I dunno. I...
- Come on, be my captain.

21:27.120 --> 21:29.710
The team needs a leader
now more than ever.

21:29.760 --> 21:31.950
How about that?

21:32.000 --> 21:34.590
- Thanks, Uncle Wade.
- Happy now?

21:34.640 --> 21:37.380
I will be when you get a round in.

21:41.040 --> 21:43.030
What do you think about that, Mum?

21:43.080 --> 21:45.150
- Are you getting my messages?
- Yes.

21:45.200 --> 21:47.190
- And?
- Later.

21:47.240 --> 21:49.240
OK?

21:52.600 --> 21:54.590
A cruise?

21:54.640 --> 21:57.480
Oh, Leo.

22:00.680 --> 22:03.430
Mrs Henderson?

22:03.480 --> 22:05.190
One of the last times we spoke,

22:05.240 --> 22:08.550
he said he had a surprise
for me. Wouldn't say what.

22:08.600 --> 22:10.600
Expensive surprise.

22:12.440 --> 22:14.230
We...

22:14.280 --> 22:16.270
We'd had a few problems.

22:16.320 --> 22:20.470
Years ago now, he was always
trying to make it up to me.

22:20.520 --> 22:23.790
When you say "problems"...

22:23.840 --> 22:26.150
Usual stuff.

22:26.200 --> 22:28.830
Mrs Henderson, Leo paid
for the trip in cash.

22:28.880 --> 22:30.910
Could you tell us where
that money came from?

22:30.960 --> 22:32.470
Cash?

22:32.520 --> 22:35.760
It's a loose end and
we'd like to tie it up.

22:36.800 --> 22:40.270
We don't have that sort
of money lying around.

22:40.320 --> 22:43.630
Maybe he got it from a friend, a relative?

22:43.680 --> 22:47.950
I suppose Elliot may
have loaned it to him.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.190
Mr Luthando,

22:49.240 --> 22:52.150
we'd like to know if you gave
Leo a cash loan recently.

22:52.200 --> 22:54.510
In the region of £10,000.

22:54.560 --> 22:56.550
I wish.

22:56.600 --> 22:59.910
This year's profits will only
just cover the set-up costs.

22:59.960 --> 23:02.030
It's more of a long-term plan.

23:02.080 --> 23:03.550
I'm intrigued, Mr Luthando.

23:03.600 --> 23:06.430
You're running an architect's practice,

23:06.480 --> 23:08.430
but you're pursuing C-10.

23:08.480 --> 23:11.550
You should try getting planning
permission past this council.

23:11.600 --> 23:13.910
All Germaine ever does
is reject my submissions.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.750
And the woman loathes me.

23:15.800 --> 23:19.030
Sounds like C-10 is a form of revenge.

23:19.080 --> 23:22.080
Wasn't the plan, but now you mention it,

23:23.240 --> 23:25.440
I rather like the idea.

23:27.080 --> 23:28.550
Hm.

23:42.840 --> 23:44.840
It's high.

23:45.960 --> 23:49.060
C-10 got you more excited than you let on?

23:50.720 --> 23:52.720
Here.

23:54.240 --> 23:57.240
I call this one... Cilla.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.270
You call them all Cilla.

24:04.240 --> 24:06.240
Thank you.

24:36.240 --> 24:37.990
You wanted to see me?

24:38.040 --> 24:40.350
I want back in, Butler.

24:40.400 --> 24:42.390
We've had this discussion.

24:42.440 --> 24:46.190
And I'm sorry, because you're
a good kid and I like you.

24:46.240 --> 24:48.310
You don't understand.

24:48.360 --> 24:50.360
I'm the Captain now.

24:53.440 --> 24:55.430
He'd booked a luxury cruise.

24:55.480 --> 24:58.110
I kept saying to him, "You don't
have to do things like that.

24:58.160 --> 25:01.460
We're fine. We've been
fine for years now."

25:03.240 --> 25:06.110
I know this is still very raw but...

25:07.160 --> 25:09.700
.. it's the anniversary today.

25:10.240 --> 25:12.630
Have you being listening
to what I'm saying?

25:12.680 --> 25:14.990
Of course.

25:15.040 --> 25:16.710
It's just that...

25:16.760 --> 25:18.750
It's what we do, Mel.

25:18.800 --> 25:21.510
- You know that.
- You can count me out.

25:21.560 --> 25:22.950
What?

25:23.000 --> 25:24.990
Leo's been murdered.

25:25.040 --> 25:27.110
What's the point now?

25:36.840 --> 25:39.990
Oh, no, no, no. You're
closing your stance.

25:40.040 --> 25:42.070
It's an old habit.

25:42.120 --> 25:43.720
So break it.

25:46.640 --> 25:47.790
Broken.

25:47.840 --> 25:49.390
Don't get too full of yourself.

25:49.440 --> 25:52.840
Your hand-eye co-ordination
just rescued you.

25:54.440 --> 25:57.070
Think you'll win the vote to ban C-10?

25:57.120 --> 25:59.790
It'll be close, but I'm hopeful.

26:03.560 --> 26:05.640
Out.

26:07.560 --> 26:10.390
Told you, open your stance.

26:10.440 --> 26:12.910
You've got a good eye.
Germaine might not agree.

26:12.960 --> 26:15.150
So how about batting for
us in the semi-final?

26:15.200 --> 26:17.670
I was thinking you could
come in number three or four.

26:17.720 --> 26:19.950
I'm more of an opening batsman.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.950
You want to take Leo's place?
Fine, the position's yours.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.550
We can hardly prop him
up at the stumps, can we?

26:26.600 --> 26:29.600
Two games away from a trip to Australia.

26:32.440 --> 26:36.440
She doesn't know it yet,
but the old girl's history.

26:40.280 --> 26:43.190
I can't help thinking that
the wrong person was murdered.

26:43.240 --> 26:46.470
Surely, it should've been Elliot.
Leo was just another player

26:46.520 --> 26:50.220
like everyone else on the
Lower Pampling eleven.

26:50.440 --> 26:52.710
What's that doing there?

26:53.600 --> 26:55.950
Something's still bugging me about Morris.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.710
I looked for his statement,
couldn't find it anywhere.

26:58.760 --> 27:01.230
Oh, it should be on my desk.

27:01.920 --> 27:03.060
Oh.

27:58.720 --> 28:00.710
I'm glad you called.

28:00.760 --> 28:04.960
Well, I thought I should tell
you face to face that um...

28:06.000 --> 28:09.270
.. I've been asked to open the
batting for Lower Pampling.

28:09.320 --> 28:11.310
Leo's position?

28:11.360 --> 28:13.400
I can tell them no.

28:15.040 --> 28:17.030
Actually...

28:17.080 --> 28:20.080
I'd rather it was you than anyone else.

28:24.440 --> 28:26.030
It's just a branch.

28:26.080 --> 28:28.150
Yeah. Didn't think I was the jumpy type.

28:28.200 --> 28:30.870
I'd say you've got good grounds.

28:34.040 --> 28:36.040
I could always stay.

28:37.240 --> 28:39.830
On the sofa, of course.

28:39.880 --> 28:42.550
Won't Germaine wonder where you've got to?

28:42.600 --> 28:45.110
I'll tell her I was
practising for the semi-final.

28:45.160 --> 28:47.430
In the dark?

28:47.480 --> 28:49.680
I eat a lot of carrots.

28:54.240 --> 28:56.150
I've never really lost someone,

28:56.200 --> 28:59.300
so I can only imagine what it does to you.

29:00.240 --> 29:03.180
It makes you forgive them everything.

29:03.680 --> 29:06.590
You focus on the good things.

29:06.640 --> 29:08.630
In fact, it's...

29:08.680 --> 29:11.550
it's like the bad never happened.

29:11.600 --> 29:14.700
I doubt there was any bad between you two.

29:15.840 --> 29:18.180
No-one escapes that, Jack.

29:19.840 --> 29:21.990
Look, I know it's not much,

29:22.040 --> 29:26.080
but if we make it to the final,
I'd like you to come and watch.

29:27.240 --> 29:30.960
In that case, you'd better
make it to the final.

31:17.200 --> 31:19.870
The threatening emails
sent to Elliot and Leo,

31:19.920 --> 31:22.430
I've traced them to a
computer's IP address.

31:22.480 --> 31:24.470
They were sent from the local library.

31:24.520 --> 31:26.590
So I compared the times
the emails were sent

31:26.640 --> 31:29.230
to the times that people came
to the library. Guess what?

31:29.280 --> 31:30.990
It's someone we know?

31:31.040 --> 31:33.710
St John Beachwood.

31:33.760 --> 31:35.270
We'd better have a word.

31:35.320 --> 31:36.870
Thought I'd drop this off.

31:36.920 --> 31:39.550
Leo Henderson's autopsy report.

31:39.600 --> 31:41.790
The personal touch. I like it.

31:41.840 --> 31:42.980
Hm.

31:49.200 --> 31:52.120
- Yes?
- Can we meet?

31:54.400 --> 31:57.150
I'll be there.

31:57.200 --> 31:59.190
Ah!

31:59.240 --> 32:01.230
You didn't come back last night.

32:01.280 --> 32:03.270
No.

32:03.320 --> 32:06.190
I... I caught up with an old friend.

32:08.800 --> 32:11.190
You...

32:11.240 --> 32:14.240
you will put a stop to this, won't you?

32:21.440 --> 32:24.150
Have you organised a police
presence for the semi-final?

32:24.200 --> 32:25.790
Already done, sir.

32:25.840 --> 32:29.350
Good work. If Leo's death
is connected to the C-10,

32:29.400 --> 32:32.140
we need extra eyes on the ground.

32:32.400 --> 32:35.470
- I'll be back shortly.
- What about St John Beachwood?

32:35.520 --> 32:37.520
He can wait for now.

32:40.200 --> 32:42.590
See? That's not like Barnaby.

32:42.640 --> 32:44.510
There's something definitely going on.

32:44.560 --> 32:46.960
OK. Leave it with me.

32:49.960 --> 32:51.960
Hello. You good boy.

32:53.200 --> 32:56.200
I was really sorry to hear about Sykes.

32:58.400 --> 33:00.150
You asked me to inform you

33:00.200 --> 33:02.710
of anything that might
help the investigation.

33:02.760 --> 33:04.470
The thing is, if I hand it over...

33:04.520 --> 33:07.510
- If? - What I mean is I need it back.

33:07.560 --> 33:10.230
They'll want to process what
I've found back in Brighton.

33:10.280 --> 33:12.830
If it was anyone else...

33:12.880 --> 33:15.550
John Barnaby. A man amongst men.

33:16.400 --> 33:19.590
I found this locked in Leo's
office. There's five grand.

33:19.640 --> 33:21.430
Found it how?

33:21.480 --> 33:23.550
His widow asked me to stay the night.

33:23.600 --> 33:25.510
Slept on the sofa.

33:25.560 --> 33:27.590
Won't Melody be missing this?

33:27.640 --> 33:29.630
I don't think she knows about it.

33:29.680 --> 33:31.750
- This was Leo's secret.
- So the question is,

33:31.800 --> 33:34.510
who gave this money to him? And why?

33:34.560 --> 33:38.310
And if I find that out, do
we have the same agreement?

33:38.360 --> 33:40.070
Of course.

33:40.120 --> 33:43.190
Germaine's not a distant
family friend at all, is she?

33:43.240 --> 33:45.230
You know I can't answer that, sir.

33:45.280 --> 33:48.070
Hello!

33:48.120 --> 33:50.950
- Ben! Oh, my goodness.
- Sarah.

33:51.000 --> 33:54.750
You thought you'd surprise me?
It's a lovely surprise at that.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.790
- How good to see you.
- You, too.

33:56.840 --> 33:58.590
Hi, Betty, you've grown.

33:58.640 --> 34:00.790
Is that the rabbit I sent her?

34:00.840 --> 34:03.310
Yeah, she loves it. She
can't sleep without it.

34:03.360 --> 34:05.070
Her godfather got something right.

34:05.120 --> 34:06.670
I knew you were the man for the job.

34:06.720 --> 34:09.389
John suggested some relative I can't bear.

34:09.440 --> 34:11.550
Nice to know I got past
your selection process.

34:11.600 --> 34:13.350
Every time. Is your gran out of hospital?

34:13.400 --> 34:15.510
Yeah, thanks, she's fighting fit.

34:15.560 --> 34:17.030
OK, good. And how's Kate?

34:17.080 --> 34:18.909
Loving the sea views.

34:18.960 --> 34:20.870
- Anyway...
- You will stay for lunch?

34:20.920 --> 34:23.150
Slightly tricky.

34:23.199 --> 34:26.300
- Jones'll call again, I'm sure.
- Yeah.

34:26.920 --> 34:29.550
You can't be going?
You've only just got here.

34:29.600 --> 34:31.870
Sarah, I don't want to say
this to you of all people

34:31.920 --> 34:34.800
but... you haven't seen me.

34:43.400 --> 34:46.230
I don't understand, sir. You
can't say where this came from?

34:46.280 --> 34:49.830
Not at the moment. Can you
ask Kam, nicely of course,

34:49.880 --> 34:53.000
- to do the forensics on this?
- Sure.

34:54.360 --> 34:58.870
By the way, did anybody check
Melody Henderson's house

34:58.920 --> 35:00.630
post the burglary?

35:00.680 --> 35:03.870
SOCO dusted, that's
all. Nothing came back.

35:03.920 --> 35:06.710
Then ask Kam, doubly nicely,

35:06.760 --> 35:10.670
to go there and check, see
if anything was missed.

35:10.720 --> 35:12.720
Sir.

35:14.640 --> 35:16.640
Panthers!

35:18.160 --> 35:21.670
You should've come with me
yesterday. It would have helped.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.990
Helped you or me, though?

35:24.600 --> 35:26.150
I thought we had a deal?

35:26.200 --> 35:28.910
You weren't gonna come and
watch till the final, remember?

35:28.960 --> 35:30.790
I wasn't sure you'd make it to the final.

35:30.840 --> 35:34.000
- I'd better have a quick net.
- You'd better.

35:37.880 --> 35:39.870
Threatening emails? I'm sorry.

35:39.920 --> 35:41.910
I'm a complete Luddite.

35:41.960 --> 35:44.270
You're barking up the wrong tree there.

35:44.320 --> 35:47.430
I must get to the semi-final.

35:47.480 --> 35:49.470
Just a moment, Mr Beachwood.

35:49.520 --> 35:51.510
Before you dash off...

35:51.560 --> 35:53.150
You signed in to use the computer

35:53.200 --> 35:57.200
at the corresponding times
that the emails were sent.

35:57.520 --> 36:00.030
You really mustn't tell Germaine.

36:00.080 --> 36:03.430
Germaine? This is a murder
investigation, Mr Beachwood.

36:03.480 --> 36:05.430
This was purely for her, I swear.

36:05.480 --> 36:07.910
But why threaten Leo Henderson?

36:07.960 --> 36:10.430
Clearly you've never met the man.

36:10.480 --> 36:13.070
Will I be charged over this?

36:13.120 --> 36:16.350
Not this time. But please
don't give me any reason

36:16.400 --> 36:19.070
to come back here, Mr Beachwood.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Is everything OK?

36:29.040 --> 36:31.760
Er... yes. Absolutely, yes.

36:57.600 --> 36:59.590
Mr Morris.

36:59.640 --> 37:01.870
Serena, isn't it?

37:01.920 --> 37:03.510
I thought we should have a word.

37:03.560 --> 37:05.830
Have to be quick, game's about to start.

37:05.880 --> 37:07.870
It's just that...

37:07.920 --> 37:10.310
Mel's pretty vulnerable right now.

37:10.360 --> 37:12.230
I think I noticed that,

37:12.280 --> 37:15.070
but thanks.

37:15.120 --> 37:17.110
I want you to stay away from her.

37:17.160 --> 37:19.630
That's not your call.

37:19.680 --> 37:21.670
I'm making it "my call".

37:21.720 --> 37:26.150
So stay out of her house
and out of her life.

37:26.200 --> 37:28.200
Do you understand?

37:31.040 --> 37:33.470
- What the hell?
- Keep your distance...

37:33.520 --> 37:36.160
Mr Morris.

37:49.640 --> 37:53.640
Go, Panthers! Whoo!

37:56.800 --> 37:59.390
You've got some nerve.

37:59.440 --> 38:02.270
We're in the eye of the storm, Germaine.

38:02.320 --> 38:04.950
No better place to make a stand.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.270
And the Panthers seem to be struggling

38:07.320 --> 38:10.390
after electing to field
first in today's semi-final.

38:10.440 --> 38:12.910
Oooh!

38:12.960 --> 38:14.910
Wide ball... Wide.

38:14.960 --> 38:18.230
Another wide from the Panthers' captain.

38:18.280 --> 38:20.550
That's some of the worst
bowling I've ever seen.

38:20.600 --> 38:23.230
I've had a bad day, OK? And
remember who you're talking to.

38:23.280 --> 38:25.390
I'm the Captain.

38:25.440 --> 38:27.430
And with two overs to go,

38:27.480 --> 38:30.070
still holding his own for Lower Pampling

38:30.120 --> 38:32.520
is newcomer Jack Morris.

38:38.800 --> 38:40.630
Oh, that's a lovely strike

38:40.680 --> 38:42.230
for four runs.

38:42.280 --> 38:44.270
He's pretty good, this Jack Morris.

38:44.320 --> 38:46.310
Yeah. Yeah, he is.

38:46.360 --> 38:48.750
Wonder of wonders, you've
got the afternoon off.

38:48.800 --> 38:52.270
I had some time due. Besides,
this game'll be quick.

38:52.320 --> 38:55.070
To be honest, it's good
to escape for a bit.

38:55.120 --> 38:56.950
It's a tough case that John's working on.

38:57.000 --> 39:00.000
Mm, he seems a bit uptight about it.

39:01.320 --> 39:03.630
Sorry, I feel like I'm
prying where I shouldn't be,

39:03.680 --> 39:05.310
but you two are OK?

39:05.360 --> 39:07.790
Yeah. Yeah, we've never been happier.

39:07.840 --> 39:09.750
That's what I said to Winter.

39:09.800 --> 39:12.760
Oooh!

39:14.560 --> 39:17.880
And there's a four, another four.

39:23.240 --> 39:26.640
He's played some classic
shots, your lodger.

39:27.000 --> 39:31.470
It's like he's watched some old
footage of you in your pomp.

39:32.920 --> 39:35.390
Well, perhaps he has at that.

39:38.800 --> 39:41.950
He'll get two there.
Mate, what are you doing?

39:42.000 --> 39:44.670
- You promised me.
- I will sort it, I swear.

39:44.720 --> 39:47.660
Morris needs one more boundary to win.

39:56.880 --> 39:58.680
And there it is!

40:00.080 --> 40:02.030
Pampling Panthers are through to the final

40:02.080 --> 40:03.670
with an excellent batting display

40:03.720 --> 40:06.150
to bring them back from
the brink of defeat.

40:06.200 --> 40:10.190
Thanks go once again to the
Lower Pampling cheerleaders.

40:10.240 --> 40:11.910
They've been fantastic today.

40:11.960 --> 40:13.270
Very entertaining!

40:13.320 --> 40:18.390
The new guy's too good. Best
get him onside before the final.

40:18.440 --> 40:21.840
Maybe show him what a
great captain you are.

40:28.800 --> 40:30.790
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

40:30.840 --> 40:34.960
Listen up, everyone, I've got a
very sombre announcement to make.

40:36.640 --> 40:39.180
First drinks are on the house!

40:39.600 --> 40:41.710
My boys did Leo proud. We're in the final.

40:41.760 --> 40:44.750
- Captain Fantastic.
- Dunno if I did that much.

40:44.800 --> 40:46.990
I am so coming to Australia with you.

40:47.040 --> 40:49.710
Well, we're not quite there yet.

40:51.400 --> 40:53.910
You'd have made Leo
proud batting like that.

40:53.960 --> 40:55.470
Ah, I'm glad you think so.

40:55.520 --> 40:58.230
Sis, where's Elliot?

40:58.280 --> 41:01.590
Where do you think? Work as usual.

41:01.640 --> 41:04.030
The man needs some family time.

41:04.080 --> 41:06.750
You think I don't tell him that?

41:08.480 --> 41:10.480
Gin and tonic.

41:11.520 --> 41:13.520
Last Chance Saloon.

41:35.200 --> 41:37.350
That was a pretty special innings.

41:37.400 --> 41:39.470
Well, someone had to
make up for your bowling.

41:39.520 --> 41:41.920
Yeah, listen, about that...

41:43.800 --> 41:46.880
You're a smart guy. You
knew what I was doing, right?

41:48.160 --> 41:50.830
How many wides and no balls
did they tell you to bowl?

41:50.880 --> 41:52.550
I counted five in two overs.

41:52.600 --> 41:54.670
See, I knew it, I knew you were smart.

41:54.720 --> 41:57.460
But also you haven't told anyone.

41:57.680 --> 41:59.670
Which intrigues me.

41:59.720 --> 42:01.720
Who am I gonna tell?

42:03.000 --> 42:06.990
Listen, Jack, I'm going to
be open and honest here.

42:07.040 --> 42:09.230
I can make you a lot of money. You and me,

42:09.280 --> 42:12.750
if we throw the final,
we can cash in big-time.

42:12.800 --> 42:15.110
- You've got the wrong guy.
- You don't understand.

42:15.160 --> 42:18.310
I keep screwing up and I
need to make this happen.

42:18.360 --> 42:20.830
It's just not cricket, mate.

42:44.880 --> 42:46.630
Yeah, it's Fitz.

42:46.680 --> 42:50.780
Doesn't matter how I got
your number. We need to talk.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.990
- You all right?
- Yeah, fine.

42:53.040 --> 42:55.580
Look... I'll be back in a bit.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.870
Hi, sorry, I was gonna
join you at the pub.

43:06.920 --> 43:08.670
I just got a bit bogged down.

43:08.720 --> 43:10.710
Never mind.

43:10.760 --> 43:13.150
Pounding headache. Might have a lie down.

43:13.200 --> 43:15.910
- Serena...
- Yes?

43:15.960 --> 43:18.030
When I've got C-10 all set up and running,

43:18.080 --> 43:20.080
I'll have more time.

44:13.960 --> 44:17.160
C'mon, pick up the
phone, pick up the phone!

44:46.680 --> 44:47.910
Easy!

44:47.960 --> 44:50.630
That's taking tree hugging
a bit far, isn't it?

44:50.680 --> 44:54.270
One Fitz Theara, Captain
of Lower Pampling.

44:54.320 --> 44:56.670
- Another dead Captain.
- Indeed.

44:56.720 --> 44:59.110
Someone had the strength
to do that to him?

44:59.160 --> 45:01.910
We've found evidence that
a blunt force was used

45:01.960 --> 45:04.030
on top of a sharpened cricket stump.

45:04.080 --> 45:06.590
Several times until he
was pinned to the tree.

45:06.640 --> 45:08.510
Who found him?

45:08.560 --> 45:09.990
Over there.

45:10.040 --> 45:13.910
She was on her way to visit
a patient in the village.

45:13.960 --> 45:17.150
- OK, let's get the stump out.
- Got it.

45:17.200 --> 45:19.190
- Are we ready?
- OK. Easy.

45:19.240 --> 45:21.230
- Easy, now.
- OK, we got him.

45:21.280 --> 45:23.230
- Slowly.
- Hold him up.

45:23.280 --> 45:25.230
OK, careful.

45:25.280 --> 45:28.630
Just move the body across on his front.

45:28.680 --> 45:31.470
Careful.

45:31.520 --> 45:33.520
Careful...

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
What's all that?

45:41.200 --> 45:43.800
It's the first I've seen of it.

45:44.960 --> 45:47.830
Can you get me some pictures?
It could be that he was pinned

45:47.880 --> 45:50.680
to this particular tree on purpose.

45:51.000 --> 45:54.870
I wanna know where that came from ASAP.

45:54.920 --> 45:57.310
See if there are any missing
from the cricket club.

45:57.360 --> 45:59.550
Also, check phone records,

45:59.600 --> 46:03.350
who didn't like Fitz,
who last saw him alive.

46:03.400 --> 46:05.190
You think it's the same killer?

46:05.240 --> 46:07.470
The second captain to be murdered.

46:07.520 --> 46:11.120
It's beginning to look
like a poisoned chalice.

46:14.400 --> 46:16.400
Barnaby.

46:18.400 --> 46:20.510
I'm sorry to do this but I...

46:20.560 --> 46:22.630
I do need to ask you some questions.

46:22.680 --> 46:24.950
Did you know the victim?

46:25.760 --> 46:27.710
Yes, he was my daughter's boyfriend.

46:27.760 --> 46:30.830
- So you knew him well?
- Reasonably.

46:30.880 --> 46:33.590
Can you think of anyone that
might want to do this to him?

46:33.640 --> 46:36.280
I'm sorry, I can't.

46:38.400 --> 46:40.270
He was a really decent lad.

46:40.320 --> 46:42.670
I can't imagine anyone who'd
want to do this to him.

46:42.720 --> 46:44.710
Kia! Kia!

46:44.760 --> 46:47.360
Kia! Kia. Ssh.

46:50.400 --> 46:52.390
I was waiting up for him.

46:52.440 --> 46:54.430
I don't understand.

46:54.480 --> 46:55.950
Ssh.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.600
Why was he all the way up here?

46:59.760 --> 47:01.750
Mum.

47:01.800 --> 47:04.430
It's OK. It's OK.

47:04.480 --> 47:07.270
It's OK. It's OK.

47:07.320 --> 47:08.920
Ssh.

47:13.520 --> 47:16.950
Kam didn't find any traces
or fibres on Fitz's body.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.790
- Time of death?
- Around 7:00pm last night.

47:19.840 --> 47:21.470
Also, we don't know what it means

47:21.520 --> 47:23.550
but the notches on the tree,

47:23.600 --> 47:25.390
there are exactly 20 of them.

47:25.440 --> 47:27.150
The last one made a day ago at most.

47:27.200 --> 47:29.270
- And the other 19?
- When were they made?

47:29.320 --> 47:31.660
Kam's still running tests.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
Barnaby.

47:36.280 --> 47:38.270
Oh, he is?

47:38.320 --> 47:40.310
Thank you.

47:40.360 --> 47:42.830
Look smart, we have a guest.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.870
Sorry, but I'm gonna need your help.

47:50.200 --> 47:53.030
My bosses have sanctioned I
work openly with you from now on.

47:53.080 --> 47:55.070
What bosses?

47:55.120 --> 47:59.510
I couldn't tell you before,
but Jones was once... you.

47:59.560 --> 48:01.360
DI Ben Jones.

48:04.120 --> 48:07.430
I'm working undercover on a
large-scale match-fixing ring.

48:07.480 --> 48:09.590
We believe it originated in Australia

48:09.640 --> 48:11.630
with the start of C-10 over there.

48:11.680 --> 48:13.750
But now it's popping
up all over the country,

48:13.800 --> 48:15.950
and for match fixers, it's ideal.

48:16.000 --> 48:20.150
The amateur game flies under
the usual watchdog radars.

48:20.200 --> 48:22.070
I had you down as a suspect.

48:22.120 --> 48:26.420
Well, if it helps any, I
would've had myself down as one.

48:27.200 --> 48:30.470
So what exactly is Germaine
Troughton's role in all this?

48:30.520 --> 48:33.910
As far as Germaine's
concerned, I'm Jack Morris.

48:33.960 --> 48:35.950
I couldn't infiltrate a cricket team

48:36.000 --> 48:37.990
without having a
connection to the village.

48:38.040 --> 48:40.230
So Germaine was approached
and sworn to secrecy.

48:40.280 --> 48:43.670
She agreed as soon as she thought
it might put an end to C-10.

48:43.720 --> 48:46.190
What I want to know is, do
you think there's a connection

48:46.240 --> 48:48.070
between the murders and match fixing?

48:48.120 --> 48:50.350
I didn't initially.

48:50.400 --> 48:52.550
But last night

48:52.600 --> 48:55.430
Fitz approached me and
openly encouraged me

48:55.480 --> 48:58.110
to sign up, make myself a lot of money.

48:58.160 --> 49:01.190
And then Fitz gets murdered
straight afterwards.

49:01.240 --> 49:03.510
I'm worried it's because
I turned him down.

49:03.560 --> 49:06.710
Why did you do that? Surely,
that's the break you wanted?

49:06.760 --> 49:08.430
I couldn't risk appearing too keen.

49:08.480 --> 49:11.670
I was gonna go back today,
tell him I'd slept on it.

49:11.720 --> 49:14.950
So if Fitz was murdered
because you turned him down,

49:15.000 --> 49:17.470
what did Leo Henderson
do to get himself killed?

49:17.520 --> 49:20.430
My guess is he won the quarter-final.

49:20.480 --> 49:22.510
And you think he was bribed not to?

49:22.560 --> 49:24.350
It's a hunch, at best.

49:24.400 --> 49:27.270
It would explain how he
paid for the cruise in cash.

49:27.320 --> 49:29.750
So Leo was meant to give
his wicket away cheaply?

49:29.800 --> 49:32.590
More that he didn't score
past a certain total.

49:32.640 --> 49:35.030
See, the betting works in insidious ways.

49:35.080 --> 49:38.230
They back the number of
wides bowled, no-balls,

49:38.280 --> 49:41.710
runs a certain batsman makes, run-outs.

49:41.760 --> 49:45.030
So it looks as if it's just
another game of cricket.

49:45.080 --> 49:48.470
- Only it's orchestrated.
- Mm-hm.

49:48.520 --> 49:51.870
We need to know exactly how
these bets are being laid.

49:51.920 --> 49:54.430
If it's illegal, it
could be on the Dark Web.

49:54.480 --> 49:57.910
If Leo and Fitz were
murdered by match fixers,

49:57.960 --> 50:01.280
then I'm afraid we have to hope
you get approached again, Jones.

50:05.960 --> 50:07.430
- Hello.
- Hello.

50:07.480 --> 50:09.790
C-10 will bring lots of
business to the village.

50:09.840 --> 50:13.150
If I win, we all win. So
please think about it carefully.

50:13.200 --> 50:16.400
- I can rely on you, Peter.
- Don't worry.

50:16.480 --> 50:20.150
- Have you spoken to Kia yet?
- I haven't had a second.

50:20.200 --> 50:23.590
Elliot, some things are more important.

50:23.640 --> 50:25.910
You don't understand how
wrong you are, Serena.

50:25.960 --> 50:28.390
Really... no idea.

50:28.440 --> 50:31.110
Hello, lovely.

50:31.160 --> 50:34.230
Even if you don't like
cricket, think of the profits.

50:34.280 --> 50:36.550
Johnnie, nice to see you.

50:40.400 --> 50:42.400
No.

50:45.800 --> 50:49.390
There's no laptop or tablet and
no sign of Fitz's phone either.

50:49.440 --> 50:51.430
Perhaps his killer took it.

50:51.480 --> 50:54.350
But I found invoices for the
building work Fitz carried out.

50:54.400 --> 50:58.350
Seems Elliot Luthando
owes him a lot of money.

50:58.400 --> 51:02.430
Look into Luthando, find out
everything you can about him.

51:02.480 --> 51:06.630
Maybe he's running the C-10 as
a cover for the match fixing.

51:06.680 --> 51:10.720
Leo was Elliot's best friend.
Leo didn't play ball, did he?

51:18.080 --> 51:20.390
You got a moment?

51:20.440 --> 51:22.580
Looks like I have now.

51:23.720 --> 51:25.790
You were talking to Fitz yesterday.

51:25.840 --> 51:27.990
Poor guy, terrible business.

51:28.040 --> 51:30.030
Tragic. But...

51:30.080 --> 51:33.470
I was wondering... Did
he say anything to you?

51:33.520 --> 51:36.150
Yeah. "Well played."

51:36.200 --> 51:38.190
You're a funny guy.

51:38.240 --> 51:41.150
Tell you what. Why don't you
tell me what you think he said?

51:41.200 --> 51:46.030
That you could be a valuable commodity.

51:46.080 --> 51:48.190
I'm not that guy.

51:48.240 --> 51:50.670
Everyone's that guy...
for the right price.

51:50.720 --> 51:53.070
Look at you.

51:53.120 --> 51:56.750
You've no job, you're shacked up
with that old girl. What is it?

51:56.800 --> 51:59.030
You get made redundant?
Did your wife leave you?

51:59.080 --> 52:04.910
Leo was barely cold and you
were straight round to Melody's.

52:04.960 --> 52:08.070
- That's a desperate man.
- So it was you at her house?

52:08.120 --> 52:10.550
I was just looking for what was mine.

52:10.600 --> 52:12.990
I paid Leo a lot of money
to get himself out early.

52:13.040 --> 52:16.150
But he just couldn't
resist a shot at glory.

52:16.200 --> 52:18.190
What if I'm made of the same stuff?

52:18.240 --> 52:21.710
Don't be a fool, Jack.
Everyone wants a better life.

52:21.760 --> 52:24.230
Especially someone like you.

52:49.480 --> 52:51.480
My God...

52:52.920 --> 52:55.830
OK. Thanks.

52:55.880 --> 52:57.990
Had someone digging into Elliot's finances

52:58.040 --> 52:59.710
and how about this?

52:59.760 --> 53:01.590
He was on the verge of bankruptcy.

53:01.640 --> 53:02.750
Hm.

53:02.800 --> 53:06.080
Which could make match
fixing extremely tempting.

53:09.400 --> 53:12.270
Tell us about your
relationship with Fitz Theara.

53:12.320 --> 53:14.310
There wasn't one.

53:14.360 --> 53:16.350
Try a little harder.

53:16.400 --> 53:18.790
We know that he worked
for you now and then.

53:18.840 --> 53:22.310
You owed him money for work he
carried out several months ago.

53:22.360 --> 53:25.390
Where were you last night
between 6:30 and 7:00pm?

53:25.440 --> 53:27.430
Here.

53:27.480 --> 53:30.350
I fell asleep at my desk.

53:30.400 --> 53:32.590
- Working late, then?
- Always.

53:32.640 --> 53:34.510
We checked with the planning committee.

53:34.560 --> 53:36.910
You haven't submitted
anything in three months.

53:36.960 --> 53:39.350
You're nearly bankrupt,

53:39.400 --> 53:41.550
so we'd like to know
where you got the finance

53:41.600 --> 53:44.190
to put the C-10 tournament on.

53:44.240 --> 53:47.150
- Your information is wrong.
- What are you working on now?

53:47.200 --> 53:48.750
That's my business.

53:48.800 --> 53:52.350
Winter, unplug Mr Luthando's
computer, would you?

53:52.400 --> 53:54.190
Excuse me?

53:54.240 --> 53:58.190
We have uncovered
evidence of match fixing.

53:58.240 --> 54:00.030
Your C-10 Slam has been infiltrated.

54:00.080 --> 54:05.190
Hang on. The matches were rigged?

54:05.240 --> 54:07.710
Two men who we know were
involved have been murdered.

54:07.760 --> 54:11.360
You have connections to both and no alibi.

54:13.800 --> 54:15.800
I'm not a murderer.

54:25.600 --> 54:28.030
I'm a gambler.

54:28.080 --> 54:31.190
I... bet on anything.

54:31.240 --> 54:32.710
Even the C-10. So, please...

54:32.760 --> 54:35.860
you'd be doing me a favour. Take it away.

54:41.800 --> 54:45.300
When will the result of
the vote be announced?

54:45.800 --> 54:48.740
Between the innings of the C-10 final.

54:50.880 --> 54:53.150
I'm sorry I have to play.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
No, you're not.

54:58.000 --> 55:01.270
But if it helps to catch a match fixer...

55:03.360 --> 55:05.360
I'll get it.

55:15.200 --> 55:17.190
Who is it?

55:17.240 --> 55:19.510
Oh, it's some prankster.

55:31.080 --> 55:33.070
Thank you.

55:33.120 --> 55:35.510
So I was carbon dating
the notches in the tree

55:35.560 --> 55:37.590
when one of my team found this.

55:37.640 --> 55:39.350
The petals are fading,

55:39.400 --> 55:41.550
so it must have been there
before Fitz was killed.

55:41.600 --> 55:43.870
Also, I've got an update on the tree.

55:43.920 --> 55:46.230
As far as I can tell,
the notches were made

55:46.280 --> 55:48.990
roughly around the same day every year.

55:49.040 --> 55:53.120
- And the last notch was made?
- Two days ago.

55:54.200 --> 55:57.670
So there are 20 notches on the tree

55:57.720 --> 56:00.910
and let's not forget 20 cricket
balls were used to batter Leo.

56:00.960 --> 56:03.750
Could be a coincidence.

56:03.800 --> 56:05.550
Winter, indulge me, would you?

56:05.600 --> 56:07.710
Of course, sir.

56:07.760 --> 56:10.470
Go back 20 years, find out
if anything unusual happened

56:10.520 --> 56:13.320
in Lower Pampling around that time.

56:54.520 --> 56:57.150
I was going to call you last night.

56:57.200 --> 56:59.470
But I know Serena warned you off.

56:59.520 --> 57:02.790
Then she'll have to try harder than that.

57:02.840 --> 57:04.950
Any idea who might have left you this?

57:05.000 --> 57:07.670
- Not really.
- Not really?

57:07.720 --> 57:09.710
I mean, no.

57:09.760 --> 57:12.590
I'm not sure I want to find out either.

57:12.640 --> 57:15.990
- Look, I'll call the police.
- Do you have to?

57:16.040 --> 57:18.510
You don't want to report it?

57:18.680 --> 57:20.640
If you don't mind.

57:40.880 --> 57:44.150
Butler Styles approached
me, then left me this.

57:44.200 --> 57:46.830
15K up front, and another 15
after I do what they want.

57:46.880 --> 57:48.870
They?

57:48.920 --> 57:51.350
Butler can't be the brains behind this.

57:51.400 --> 57:53.310
He's the gopher, the middle man.

57:53.360 --> 57:55.350
All the same, we'll look into him.

57:55.400 --> 57:57.950
- Who else are we looking at?
- That's the next step.

57:58.000 --> 58:01.270
- These people are dangerous.
- I'm too close to walk away.

58:01.320 --> 58:03.390
- Then at least do us a favour?
- What?

58:03.440 --> 58:06.950
Don't become Captain. The last
two didn't have a lot of luck.

58:07.000 --> 58:10.000
I'll bear that in mind. Oh, by the way.

58:11.440 --> 58:13.750
Someone left this for Melody last night.

58:13.800 --> 58:15.870
Might be significant.

58:21.680 --> 58:23.320
Jones.

58:24.360 --> 58:26.360
I know, sir.

58:35.080 --> 58:38.390
Let's ask St John why we keep
finding his beheaded flowers.

58:38.440 --> 58:41.470
Sir, you might want to
take a look at this.

58:41.520 --> 58:44.750
That's Melody Henderson and
that's Serena Luthando.

58:44.800 --> 58:48.750
With a girl who went missing
two decades ago, no less.

58:48.800 --> 58:53.550
Cilla Troughton, daughter of
retired England cricket captain

58:53.600 --> 58:55.600
Germaine Troughton.

58:57.360 --> 58:58.720
Hm.

59:05.360 --> 59:07.390
I don't understand.

59:07.440 --> 59:10.630
We believe we found a memorial
of sorts to your daughter.

59:10.680 --> 59:13.230
I'm sorry. What are you saying?

59:13.280 --> 59:15.670
Why would there be a memorial?

59:15.720 --> 59:18.830
Would you care to explain
these, Mr Beachwood?

59:18.880 --> 59:22.470
Only, we found one where
Fitz Theara was murdered.

59:22.520 --> 59:25.150
This was attached to a wreath
sent to Melody Henderson.

59:25.200 --> 59:27.190
Can you tell us how they got there?

59:27.240 --> 59:29.270
What has that got to do with Cilla?

59:29.320 --> 59:30.590
Mr Beachwood?

59:30.640 --> 59:34.270
I'm sorry, I'm at a complete loss.

59:34.320 --> 59:36.390
We saw the beheaded
flowers in your garden.

59:36.440 --> 59:40.670
- And I know you saw them, too.
- Probably vandals.

59:40.720 --> 59:42.710
Is there something you'd like to tell us?

59:42.760 --> 59:45.790
Has Cilla returned to Lower Pampling?

59:45.840 --> 59:47.870
No, of course she hasn't.

59:47.920 --> 59:49.670
I'd know if she had.

59:49.720 --> 59:52.760
- You haven't heard from her?
- Not in 20 years.

59:56.400 --> 59:58.750
Aha, see you got my little gift, then.

59:58.800 --> 01:00:01.230
It's a lot of money.

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:03.270
The tip of a very big iceberg.

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:06.320
Step into my office and I'll
give you your instructions.

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:09.910
I don't bite.

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:13.190
- It's not your bite that worries me.
- Meaning what?

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:15.510
I want to talk to the organ
grinder, not the monkey.

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:17.670
- Now, listen!
- No, mate. You listen.

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:19.830
I don't want to end up like Leo or Fitz.

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:22.270
I want guarantees from the top man.

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:23.790
Or woman.

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:26.110
It doesn't work like that.

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:28.300
Then it's time it did.

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:40.430
We've got a problem.

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:13.680
Hello?

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:17.880
Mel?

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:20.220
Serena.

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:24.870
You got the same text?

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:26.120
Yes.

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:30.480
Serena...

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:34.470
They're not moving.

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.070
Good. Now, let's get out of here.

01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:39.320
- Hello?
- Let's just call someone.

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:52.710
Hello, girls.

01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:54.700
Long time, no see.

01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:57.060
Cilla?

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:26.430
Mm. That's nice.

01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:28.750
A little memorial for me.

01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:32.700
Did you like the ones I left for you?

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:36.350
Oh, sorry, did I scare you?

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:38.400
I don't understand.

01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:41.670
Why are you here?

01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:44.390
And why have you called us to the tree?

01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:46.470
Because this is where you left me.

01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:52.240
Curled up, crying, begging.

01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:56.420
When did you get back?

01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:01.020
You're asking the wrong question, Mel.

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:04.440
Listen. Can you hear it?

01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:10.720
That's the sound of your
scared hearts pounding.

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:15.750
Count the beats, go on.

01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:18.230
Then add them together.

01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:20.990
And then you'll get a sense
of just how frightened I was

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:23.840
when you left me here 20 years ago.

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:27.910
So you're here to get your own back?

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:36.480
You know the deal!

01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:47.880
Well, put it down to the not
uncommon fear of being killed.

01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:09.360
Yeah, I'm laughing so hard right now.

01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:14.680
Let's do this face to face!

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:34.390
Wade?

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:36.910
You've got two choices, Jack.

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:43.320
One, you fix the match.

01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:47.910
Or two... I fix you.

01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:50.080
Don't screw it up...

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:53.120
.. Captain.

01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:56.830
Captain?

01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:59.620
I'll throw that in with the deal.

01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:30.910
Why are you here?

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:32.550
Why haven't you arrested Cilla?

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:35.750
We spoke to her mother. She
had no idea she was even back.

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:38.030
Talk us through what happened last night.

01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:41.470
We know Cilla disappeared
20 years ago. But not why.

01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:49.110
We were friends.

01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:51.160
The three of us.

01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:54.510
Inseparable.

01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:57.840
We had our own code, our own rules.

01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:01.660
All for one, and all that.

01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:04.390
But it clearly didn't last.

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:06.710
Mel married young.

01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:10.080
Leo was the prize catch, the
one all the girls wanted.

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:17.600
And then, after a while,
he looked elsewhere.

01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:21.030
To Cilla.

01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:23.070
They had an affair?

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:25.390
It tore Mel's heart out.

01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:29.640
All those years of
friendship reduced to nothing.

01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:35.640
So...

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:39.760
.. we went after Cilla.

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:47.390
We drove her to the
outskirts of the village

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:51.480
in the dead of night, screamed, shouted...

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:57.440
And we told her...

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:02.270
.. don't ever come back.

01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:04.590
But why the memorial?

01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:09.190
After she left, we
regretted what we'd done.

01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:11.350
We tried to find her, but we couldn't.

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:13.470
Time went past and...

01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:17.960
.. we started to think something
must have happened to her.

01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:22.040
And now she's back.

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:25.350
You need to speak to your mother.

01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:29.310
What happens if she bumps
into Serena or Melody

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:31.350
and they tell her they've seen you?

01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:33.390
Imagine what that would do to her.

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:35.780
She did a lot worse to me.

01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:38.430
She misses you.

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:40.550
I've missed you, too.

01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:46.470
I know that, and you've always
been like a father to me.

01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:49.350
But you need to let this go.

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:02.990
Is Cilla Troughton staying here?

01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:05.040
Come in.

01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:13.270
I went for a walk last night.

01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:15.710
Arrest me.

01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:18.229
You left two women terrified.

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:20.630
Poor them.

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:23.680
I'd like to hear your version
of what happened 20 years ago.

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:26.910
I fell for the wrong man,

01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:30.720
yet I was the one hounded
out of the village.

01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:34.229
They say it takes two to tango?

01:08:34.279 --> 01:08:35.950
Not in this case.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.590
When did you come back to Lower Pampling?

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:41.670
After Leo was killed. Trust me.

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:43.630
We'll still need to know your whereabouts

01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:45.910
at the times of both murders.

01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:47.790
I didn't meet Fitz, let alone know him.

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:52.390
Cilla, we know you have a
police record for stalking.

01:08:52.439 --> 01:08:53.990
We ran a check on you.

01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:56.630
Ten years ago you had a
restraining order placed on you.

01:08:56.680 --> 01:09:00.350
A family complained you showed
up everywhere they went.

01:09:00.399 --> 01:09:02.670
Is that all you've got?

01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:04.910
Like it or not, you're involved

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:06.550
in a murder investigation, Cilla.

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:08.939
Well, you've got it wrong.

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:17.590
Don't leave the village
without letting us know.

01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:20.149
Listen, you mustn't be angry.

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:23.830
Cilla?

01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:26.750
I told you. I don't want to see her.

01:09:32.279 --> 01:09:35.590
Wade McMaster approached Jones last night.

01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:37.950
He's the brains behind the match fixing.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.029
Butler Styles is his right-hand man.

01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:43.470
Question is, can we put either of them

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:45.870
at the scenes of the murders?

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:48.590
The tech team went through
Elliot Luthando's computer.

01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:51.870
They found a link to a gambling
site taking bets on the C-10.

01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:54.630
Have they managed to get an IP address?

01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:56.870
No match with Wade or Butler's computer.

01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:59.860
- Who then?
- They're tracing it now.

01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:03.880
Why am I here?

01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:10.510
You do know what you've
been doing, don't you, Kia?

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:12.190
Helping my uncle.

01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:13.870
Working on his betting site.

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:16.750
- That's a crime?
- It is when it's match fixing.

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:20.110
The odds are crooked, the games are fixed.

01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:22.360
No.

01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:26.000
My Uncle Wade wouldn't do that.

01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:29.750
He wouldn't.

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:32.740
Your boyfriend Fitz was also involved.

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:36.110
It might be why he was murdered.

01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:40.350
It's true, Kia.

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:42.390
But last time I saw him...

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:48.070
he had a plan, we were going
to Australia for the C-10 trip.

01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:50.590
Possibly on illegal proceeds.

01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:53.830
No.

01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:55.870
Fitz would've told me.

01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:59.160
He couldn't. Your uncle
wouldn't allow that.

01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:05.430
Kia, your father places
bets on Wade's gambling site.

01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:09.480
He's almost bankrupt because
of the losses he's incurred.

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:15.510
Your uncle has all but
wrecked your parents' lives.

01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:17.750
And he could be linked to both murders.

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:20.000
You could help us, Kia.

01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:26.640
I don't understand.

01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:30.910
I don't know what to say.

01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:36.100
Where have you been?
What have you been doing?

01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:38.910
That's a good question.

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:43.800
Cleaner, dishwasher, barmaid.

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:47.660
I've had to be to survive.

01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:51.430
You never thought to come home?

01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:53.280
To what exactly?

01:11:56.840 --> 01:11:59.360
So why are you here now?

01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:05.790
I got tired of seeing you
on your own, Germaine.

01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:08.390
I couldn't bear it, so a few months ago

01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:10.710
I set about looking for Cilla.

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:13.110
And you kept that from me?

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:17.040
He tracked me down. He thought
he could make things better.

01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:24.350
I hoped so, too, but when I got
back I just couldn't face you.

01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:28.070
How could you just... disappear?

01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:30.430
Every time the phone rang
I thought it might be you.

01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:33.270
You seriously thought that?

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:35.320
After what you did?

01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:39.230
I called you that night.

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:43.060
After Serena and Mel were so horrible.

01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:47.310
I needed to be somewhere safe.

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:49.630
I never really understood
what was happening.

01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:52.470
You didn't even listen.

01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:56.520
You said, "No, I don't want you here!"

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:02.390
Living together was
hopeless. It never worked.

01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:04.920
"I don't want you here."

01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:08.460
Those were your words.

01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:11.560
And then you hung up on me.

01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:17.760
Well... here I am.

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:23.150
We could try again, couldn't we?

01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:30.900
I knew this was a mistake.

01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:17.830
There's no sign upstairs, sir.

01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:20.350
- Try the back.
- Yes, sir.

01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:25.910
They picked up Butler,
but Wade's gone AWOL.

01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:28.500
All local forces are on alert.

01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:32.310
Killing Leo I can understand.

01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:34.110
But Fitz played his part,

01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:37.230
he bowled wides and no-balls.
He didn't let them down.

01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:40.710
So why kill him and then
risk their entire set-up

01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:42.470
by approaching a new player in Jones?

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:45.390
You don't think the murders are
linked to the match-fixing?

01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:48.150
It doesn't add up. What
have you got for me?

01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:50.870
This is the file on
Cilla's restraining order.

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:52.870
It wasn't the family
she kept trying to see

01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:54.830
but more specifically their adopted son.

01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:56.870
And how old is this child now?

01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:58.510
19.

01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:02.270
Which means he was conceived 20 years ago.

01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:03.870
That number keeps coming up, sir.

01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:05.390
Do you think this is Cilla's son?

01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:08.590
If it is, it's likely
that Leo is the father.

01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:10.630
Odd no-one mentioned it.

01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:12.110
Indeed.

01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:15.800
I suspect we may find the
answer at the C-10 final.

01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:24.230
I see you've been washing your own kit?

01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:26.280
For once.

01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:31.000
I even hung my jacket up. That's
got to be worth a gold star.

01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:36.060
Aren't you gonna wish me luck?

01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:43.270
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:46.190
welcome to the first ever final

01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:47.990
of the Midsomer County

01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:51.390
Premier League C-10 Slam!

01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:53.440
Serena, please.

01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:58.470
Your brother, he made
fools of us all, Serena.

01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:01.030
Well, he wasn't the only
one to fool us, was he?

01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:04.480
At least he didn't
gamble away all our money.

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:08.590
It's a beautiful day for a beautiful game!

01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:11.270
It's nice to see so many people here.

01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:14.070
Go, Panthers! Go, go, go, Panthers!

01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:15.390
Whoo!

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:21.150
Go, Panthers!

01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:22.870
Go, go, go, Panthers!

01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:24.190
Whoo!

01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:36.150
Nine, eight,

01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:37.510
seven,

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:40.230
six, five, four,

01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:43.430
three, two, one!

01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:46.830
That's a brilliant
wicket for Lower Pampling.

01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:48.510
I don't see Jones out there.

01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:50.670
I didn't know we were looking for him.

01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:52.710
We're not.

01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:54.760
OK...

01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:58.790
Oh. Have you come to watch the final?

01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:00.670
This is a work visit, I'm afraid.

01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:02.870
I knew you were a modernist.

01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:06.720
- We noticed Ben isn't playing.
- Isn't he?

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
His car's here.

01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:22.750
Hey!

01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:24.800
I don't understand.

01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:37.990
What have I ever done to you?

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.430
You're gonna regret this.

01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:48.430
I promise you.

01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:50.480
No answer.

01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:56.910
I need a last known triangulation

01:17:56.960 --> 01:18:00.060
on the phone number I'm about to send you.

01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:03.630
We're on, sir.

01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:05.680
You'd better go.

01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:15.110
St John.

01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:17.150
Chief Inspector.

01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:19.270
There's something that's been worrying me.

01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:21.470
Why now?

01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:24.710
Why decide to track Cilla
down now after all these years?

01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:26.760
What happened?

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:31.120
I'm sorry.

01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:34.320
I should have told you.

01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:37.520
Hello!

01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:40.840
Hello?

01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:49.870
I couldn't believe it when you texted me.

01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:51.270
You come alone?

01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:53.630
- Where have you been?
- I know how to hide.

01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:55.670
I might beg to differ.

01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:58.660
This was for making me believe in you.

01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:01.910
We've got you on a series
of match-fixing counts.

01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:04.270
But what I want to know is,
where have you got Jones?

01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:06.870
Jones? Who's Jones? Jack Morris.

01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:09.520
He'll be at the game, won't he?

01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:16.950
Winter, I've got the triangulation back.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.140
I know where Jones is.

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:24.390
Just so you know, your grip's all wrong.

01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:26.310
One more innings?

01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:29.520
Germaine.

01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:34.590
That was some risk you took.

01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:38.840
Living with a policeman while
trying to get away with murder.

01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:43.870
Leo wasn't planned.

01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:46.910
Just a spur of the moment
thing. Red mist descending.

01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:48.950
You need to learn to count to ten.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.360
What did Leo do that upset you so much?

01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:56.230
I never had any time for him.

01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:58.750
This wasn't about C-10, was it?

01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:00.630
I don't know what you mean.

01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:03.550
We know about your grandson.

01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:05.590
Cilla's son.

01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:09.550
He contacted you, didn't he?

01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:11.590
He was looking for his mother.

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:15.710
You couldn't help him, couldn't
offer him a single thing.

01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:18.320
So I went to see Leo.

01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:22.910
Find out whatever he knew about his son.

01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:27.070
Turned out he'd known about him all along.

01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:31.750
All he was worried about
was Melody finding out.

01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:33.470
He threatened me.

01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:38.070
He said if she did find out,
I would be very, very sorry.

01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:41.510
But after the quarter-final
you sought Leo out again.

01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:43.560
I was so angry.

01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:48.070
He was so uncaring about Cilla.

01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:52.680
So arrogant, boasting
about his great innings.

01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:57.590
I kept thinking about Cilla's life...

01:20:57.640 --> 01:21:00.150
and my life.

01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:03.320
How they could have been so much better.

01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:07.990
I just wanted to shut him up.

01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:12.280
And the bowling machine was right there.

01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:16.520
Tell me about Fitz.

01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:22.440
He was just outside the
practice area when I killed Leo.

01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:29.310
I had no idea until he
phoned me and he wanted money.

01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:32.470
Lots and lots of money.

01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:35.270
And what about me, Germaine?

01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:37.320
I thought you knew.

01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:43.280
The way you looked at
me this morning. You...

01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:45.630
The stump...

01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:48.590
my test match trophy stump...

01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:51.430
.. had been on the wall and
it wasn't there any more.

01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:54.720
The stump you used to kill Fitz.

01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:59.510
You're a policeman, you
must have worked it out.

01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:02.350
I thought you knew.

01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:05.000
I didn't even notice, Germaine.

01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:10.350
Mum?

01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:14.990
No! No, take her away, I don't
want her to see me like this.

01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:17.150
You heard from my son? What did he say?

01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:18.670
Did he ask about me?

01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:20.920
He was looking for you.

01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:24.400
There was no way that I could help him.

01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:30.550
If you knew how much I
regretted all those years...

01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:32.630
I called you that night...

01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:35.150
I was trying to tell
you that I was pregnant

01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:37.910
and all you had to do was listen.

01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:39.950
And you didn't.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
What have you done?

01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:47.840
I am... so sorry.

01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:52.160
For everything.

01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:56.900
I really let the side down, didn't I?

01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:00.960
And you.

01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:27.920
Thanks.

01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:34.910
You're lucky it was your head.

01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:36.950
Very amusing.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.990
And thanks for the help with Wade.

01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:41.030
Any time.

01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:43.480
Wait, please...

01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:55.120
There's something... I want to give you.

01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:00.110
Should have given it to you years ago.

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:01.670
- No.
- Take it.

01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:03.350
The house is yours.

01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:04.800
I can't.

01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:07.760
Take it!

01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:11.230
I want you to be safe.

01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:15.400
And I want your... son to be safe.

01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:18.710
I know he wants you to call him.

01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:21.630
Look after him.

01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:24.550
Like I should have looked after you.

01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:29.630
As promised, the results
of the C-10 referendum.

01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:34.030
Those in favour of C-10... 188.

01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:37.670
Those against...

01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:40.230
181.

01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:41.990
The vote in favour wins!

01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:45.160
C-10 looks set to stay.

01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:50.270
Don't get too excited, Elliot.

01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:53.720
Kia and I will be running
things from now on.

01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:01.190
Serena...

01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:03.710
I'm going to find Cilla.

01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:06.430
It's time to apologise properly.

01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:09.760
Are you coming?

01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:20.830
Howzat?

01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:23.230
Clean bowled.

01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:24.920
Germaine.

01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:37.270
And there's still all to
play for in the C-10 final.

01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:40.270
With one ball remaining,

01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:43.420
the whole competition could go either way.

01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:07.110
Come on, Jones!

01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:09.430
I'm not sure he should even be playing.

01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:11.550
Well, if he collapses, I'm a doctor.

01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:13.590
Of sorts.

01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:16.510
Maybe I should introduce you
two properly after the game.

01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:18.270
- What do they need?
- A six.

01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:21.230
- He'd better hold his nerve.
- His nerve will be fine.

01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:23.550
He was very well trained.

01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:35.590
Yes!

01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:37.440
And it's a six!

01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:39.760
Yes.

01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:42.270
A fantastic competition.

01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:46.470
Congratulations to the
Lower Pampling Panthers.

01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:48.750
Thanks also to the runners-up,

01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:50.710
Causton Crusaders.

01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:53.560
See you all again next year, folks.

01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:03.750
Hey-hey-hey!

01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:06.070
Not too shabby, Captain Jones.

01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:07.550
Australia, here you come.

01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:10.870
- Australia?
- Oh, I doubt that.

01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:13.390
- Well done, Jones.
- You're being subtle.

01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:16.750
Oh, I'm out of practice.
Not used to being single.

01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:19.910
Single? What, you finished
with er... what's-his-name?

01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:22.900
- You never said.
- You never asked.

01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:26.300
Shall we get the beers in?

01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:28.760
Yeah.

01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:34.430
So, how you finding him?

01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:35.670
Does he still stand there

01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:37.870
and do that weird squinting
when he's thinking?

01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:39.590
Loads. I thought he was short-sighted.

01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:41.150
Never calls you by your first name.

01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:42.470
I don't think he knows it.

01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:44.030
- You never know
- what he's thinking

01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:47.180
- We're not mind-readers.
- Thank you...

01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:50.680
Ben and...

01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:53.990
- Jamie, sir.
- Jamie...

01:27:57.720 --> 01:27:59.720
Cheers.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:03.990
Thank you.

01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:07.360
So, a little bird tells me
you've not been yourself lately.

01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:11.830
I finally realised the future
isn't actually on its way.

01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:14.480
In truth, it's already arrived.

01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:17.630
Ah, Paddy, my boy.

01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:19.670
You were right all along!

01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:21.720
We've got to move with the times.
