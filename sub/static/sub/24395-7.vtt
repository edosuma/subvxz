in the last call.

12:12.887 --> 12:15.002
All the data suggests
it's an empty threat.

12:15.004 --> 12:17.499
I don't care about your data.
If we pay him off now,

12:17.501 --> 12:19.806
he releases my husband... yes or no?

12:20.962 --> 12:24.363
Well, I believe so, yes.
But it risks leaving

12:24.365 --> 12:25.898
your brother-in-law bankrupt.
I mean, you give me

12:25.900 --> 12:27.700
more time and pay less.

12:27.702 --> 12:29.836
No. No. It... it's still a gamble.

12:30.608 --> 12:32.171
I want this to be over.

12:32.173 --> 12:34.712
If Michael's willing to pay,
why can't you hear that?

12:34.737 --> 12:36.876
ERIC: Oh, we do. Absolutely. But
sometimes you got to question

12:36.878 --> 12:39.512
what your instinct's telling you
and take a different path.

12:40.451 --> 12:42.782
Either way, you pay a price.

12:48.656 --> 12:50.256

12:50.670 --> 12:52.391
But you didn't.

12:52.393 --> 12:54.227
They were screwing each other.

12:54.229 --> 12:55.862
- Brooke and Michael.
- No.

12:55.864 --> 12:58.131
We looked at that,
and categorically they weren't.

12:58.133 --> 12:59.699
I'm stating a fact.

12:59.701 --> 13:01.834
She married a loser
and decided to switch rides.

13:01.836 --> 13:03.402
That baby she's carrying

13:03.404 --> 13:05.004
isn't Gerry's... it's Michael's.

13:05.006 --> 13:06.472
And she's being arrested right now.

13:07.931 --> 13:10.676
You are so behind the curve,
it's embarrassing.

13:14.449 --> 13:16.682
These are transcripts

13:16.684 --> 13:18.851
of a deleted conversation
retrieved from the hard drive

13:18.853 --> 13:20.720
on Brooke Reed's laptop.

13:21.618 --> 13:23.036
Evidence...

13:23.725 --> 13:25.725
of a contract she made on the dark web

13:25.727 --> 13:27.393
with an unknown professional

13:27.395 --> 13:29.295
to kidnap and kill her husband

13:29.297 --> 13:32.532
for a payment of no less
than half a million dollars.

13:32.534 --> 13:34.505
The kicker is...

13:35.715 --> 13:37.336
her demanding Michael see it.

13:38.092 --> 13:40.239
She wanted him to see his brother die

13:40.241 --> 13:42.875
as payback for ending their affair.

13:43.348 --> 13:44.644
Turns out Michael wasn't as thrilled

13:44.646 --> 13:46.212
about having a kid as she'd hoped.

13:46.935 --> 13:48.414
It's why she didn't
want you and your team

13:48.416 --> 13:49.715
getting involved.

13:50.271 --> 13:52.552
Why she was so insistent you settle

13:52.554 --> 13:54.787
before the ransom dropped too low.

13:56.259 --> 13:58.224
She played you, Eric.

13:58.655 --> 13:59.559
And someone else

13:59.561 --> 14:01.366
paid the price.

14:02.575 --> 14:04.697
Just like Freddie Woods.

14:12.540 --> 14:14.307
Freddie was a friend of yours?

14:14.309 --> 14:15.875
And my supervisor.

14:15.877 --> 14:18.010
Until you got him killed.

14:18.591 --> 14:21.147
You're confused, Agent Kendall.

14:21.678 --> 14:23.349
Damien Delaine got Freddie Woods killed.

14:23.351 --> 14:26.506
- Not me.
- It was your incompetence

14:26.508 --> 14:28.387
that triggered his trap.

14:28.389 --> 14:30.690
You screwed up that negotiation, too.

14:30.692 --> 14:34.694
Only this time, you don't get to go home.

14:36.602 --> 14:38.297
I didn't do it! I didn't do it!

14:38.299 --> 14:39.665
Why would I kill my husband?

14:39.667 --> 14:41.667
I didn't do it! You have to tell them!

14:41.669 --> 14:44.070
I didn't do it! She's telling the truth.

He was godfather to one of Todd's kids.

He blames you for Freddie's death.

Well, that's not gonna happen.

17:16.619 --> 17:18.586
Mrs. Reed is being charged with murder.

17:18.588 --> 17:20.741
The FBI is not gonna let us talk to her.

If she goes to jail,
that leaves whoever did this

Eric, Agent Kendall has a transcript

19:26.316 --> 19:27.582

I mean, there's a-a science
and a protocol to support it,

21:11.021 --> 21:12.887
but in the end, I go with my gut.

21:12.889 --> 21:14.470

21:14.472 --> 21:16.470
If I can't trust myself,

21:16.472 --> 21:18.893
if I can't depend on
my own instincts, I'm finished.

about this case,

21:32.809 --> 21:34.242

21:34.244 --> 21:36.544
Brooke Reed didn't hire that kidnapper.

21:36.546 --> 21:38.246

was attracted to her.

“If I get rid of my brother...”

22:14.751 --> 22:16.168
of Agent Kendall.

22:18.164 --> 22:19.221
(DOOR CLOSES)

22:19.223 --> 22:20.865
You got it.

22:45.774 --> 22:47.574
<i>(KNOCKING ON DOOR)</i>

22:55.725 --> 22:57.818
Who have you come to save now?

23:12.075 --> 23:13.421
Hey.

23:13.423 --> 23:15.002
Hi, uh...

23:15.478 --> 23:17.451
I'm just working up a profile
on Agent Kendall.

23:17.453 --> 23:19.715
Great. I'll help.

23:27.657 --> 23:29.573
What I said to Eric...

23:30.553 --> 23:31.926
you were thinking it, too.

23:31.928 --> 23:33.428
And saying it helps how?

23:33.430 --> 23:34.741
Because no one ever does.

23:36.501 --> 23:38.902
Everyone's too afraid to say anything

23:38.904 --> 23:41.337
about how they feel, what they want...

23:43.739 --> 23:46.283
I don't want to live
like that anymore, Oliver.

23:46.711 --> 23:48.827
Yeah, neither do I.

23:54.352 --> 23:55.618
We told them

23:55.620 --> 23:57.587
that Eric's never lost a hostage,

23:57.589 --> 23:58.888
but 17 years ago,

23:58.890 --> 24:00.523
he couldn't save my mother either,

24:00.525 --> 24:03.593
and that's why he can't face this.

24:04.134 --> 24:06.195
He needs to help people, not feel

24:06.197 --> 24:08.138
like he's contributed to their death.

24:09.434 --> 24:11.141
So do I.

24:13.538 --> 24:15.229
Yeah.

24:16.174 --> 24:17.607
You were right, Mr. Beaumont.

24:17.609 --> 24:19.175
I should've listened to you.

24:19.177 --> 24:21.610
You said that I would go broke.

24:22.914 --> 24:25.648
I'm gonna have to sell it all,

24:25.650 --> 24:27.658
lay everyone off.

24:28.186 --> 24:31.495
I think I got a buyer
for the car, though, so...

24:32.490 --> 24:34.824
It's too late for Gerry, though.

24:38.730 --> 24:40.921
I'm not a liar, Mr. Beaumont.

24:42.434 --> 24:44.600
I didn't sleep with my brother's wife.

24:44.602 --> 24:46.235
But you wanted to.

24:46.237 --> 24:49.339
Yeah, well, you know, so did she.

24:49.930 --> 24:52.375
She came on to me pretty hard one night,

24:52.377 --> 24:54.310
but I said no,

24:54.312 --> 24:56.879
- because I loved my brother.
- (CORK POPS)

24:56.881 --> 24:59.449
FBI thinks she's pregnant
with your child.

25:01.984 --> 25:04.053
Yeah, I know.

25:04.055 --> 25:06.055
They showed me her laptop.

25:06.057 --> 25:08.491
(SCOFFS) You know, if
you're hiring a hit man,

25:08.493 --> 25:10.226
why not just pay him?

25:10.743 --> 25:11.761
Why justify it

25:11.763 --> 25:14.872
with a whole pack of lies
and say that I was the father?

25:15.789 --> 25:18.584
I thought Gerry was
the crazy one. (CHUCKLES)

25:22.941 --> 25:25.108
- What do you mean, Mr. Reed?
- Oh, come on.

25:25.110 --> 25:26.676
You think Gerry's restaurant
would've failed

25:26.678 --> 25:28.277
if I was the one backing him?

25:29.094 --> 25:32.548
He would've rather got money
from some mobster,

25:32.550 --> 25:35.218
just to show that he was
a better businessman.

25:35.220 --> 25:37.787
He thought he was building an empire.

25:39.813 --> 25:42.524
You know what the worst part
of this whole thing is...

25:43.261 --> 25:44.427
is that it's my fault.

25:44.943 --> 25:46.229
I took 'em in.

25:46.231 --> 25:48.865
I gave his wife a taste of the good life.

25:48.867 --> 25:50.400
(CHUCKLES)

25:50.402 --> 25:52.368
You know, if she'd got away with it,

25:52.370 --> 25:55.496
I probably would've
married her out of guilt,

25:56.413 --> 25:58.720
and that kid would've really been mine.

26:00.084 --> 26:02.845
Gerry's paranoia would've come true.

26:21.366 --> 26:22.765
What's happened? What's wrong?

26:23.021 --> 26:24.287
Nothing.

26:24.312 --> 26:26.302
We're just working on a profile
for Todd Kendall.

26:26.304 --> 26:28.237
How'd it go with Michael?
You think he's behind this?

26:28.239 --> 26:31.340
No, but you were right, Maxine.

26:31.907 --> 26:34.010
- I-I was?
- We all were.

26:34.012 --> 26:37.013
Every call we made, every
decision can still hold true

26:37.015 --> 26:39.348
if the No-End scenario was fake.

26:39.350 --> 26:40.917
What are you talking about?

26:40.919 --> 26:42.852
Gerry's still alive.

26:45.757 --> 26:47.256
Now all we got to do is prove it

26:47.258 --> 26:50.359
before he decides
to kill someone for real.

26:59.486 --> 27:00.852
Eric...

27:01.745 --> 27:04.489
we saw Gerry Reed get shot and killed.

27:04.491 --> 27:05.457
Did we?

27:05.459 --> 27:07.025
Yes.

27:07.027 --> 27:08.894
Okay.

27:08.896 --> 27:10.529
Here's Brooke and Gerry
toasting with Barlucci

27:10.531 --> 27:11.963
at the opening of their restaurant,

27:11.965 --> 27:14.890
found on Gerry's laptop. And here...

27:14.892 --> 27:18.403
is the exact same video
on Gerry's social media page.

27:20.789 --> 27:23.032
Gerry matted him out of the video.

27:23.034 --> 27:24.967
So he didn't want a felon on his website.

27:24.969 --> 27:26.278
What does that prove?

27:26.280 --> 27:28.847
If Gerry had the skills to
edit someone out of a video,

27:28.849 --> 27:30.615
he also had the skills

27:30.617 --> 27:32.968
to edit someone in.

27:35.823 --> 27:38.290
So, you're saying the kidnapper was...

27:38.292 --> 27:40.172
Holy crap. Gerry Reed.

27:40.174 --> 27:42.736
Staging his own death
on a video green screen

27:42.738 --> 27:43.716
to fool us.

27:43.718 --> 27:45.497
OLIVER: Pre-set squibs under his shirt

27:45.499 --> 27:47.799
with fake blood, a gun firing blanks...

27:47.801 --> 27:48.900
Gerry under that mask the whole time,

27:48.902 --> 27:50.135
disguising his voice.

27:50.137 --> 27:51.603
But even if that's all true,

27:51.605 --> 27:54.172
what about the burnt body,
Gerry's dental records?

27:54.174 --> 27:56.468
- Oh.
- ERIC: What?

27:56.470 --> 27:58.310
I'm just remembering something.

27:58.312 --> 28:02.681
Uh... I checked Gerry's social media log.

28:02.683 --> 28:06.084
Two weeks ago, he removed
Joe Hearst as a friend.

28:06.086 --> 28:08.053
That's the only person
he's ever done that to.

28:08.055 --> 28:09.988
- Okay, that's intriguing.
- It gets better.

28:10.692 --> 28:12.735
Joe Hearst is a security guard

28:12.737 --> 28:14.693
at Mount Hood Medical University...

28:14.695 --> 28:17.028
one of the biggest repositories

28:17.030 --> 28:19.301
of donated bodies for medical research,

28:19.303 --> 28:22.234
- and a dental school.
- Cadaver central.

28:22.236 --> 28:23.702
Chase it down. Get the proof.

28:23.704 --> 28:26.355
- Where are you going?
- To see Brooke.

28:26.940 --> 28:28.573
We're not out of this yet.

28:32.402 --> 28:34.079
TODD: You got some nerve, Beaumont.

28:34.081 --> 28:36.548
Have you got a confession out of Brooke?

28:36.550 --> 28:38.850
Michael won't budge either.
Your hit man, Barlucci...

28:38.852 --> 28:41.257
I mean, he's got an ironclad alibi.

28:41.259 --> 28:43.244
- Who told you that?
- Well, if he didn't,

28:43.246 --> 28:44.122
you would've charged me by now.

28:44.124 --> 28:46.170
But you don't have
enough evidence yet, do you?

28:46.172 --> 28:48.794
No way on earth am I letting
you talk to Brooke Reed.

28:48.796 --> 28:50.929
You'd be listening to every word I say.

28:50.931 --> 28:52.097
What do you have to lose?

28:53.048 --> 28:54.866
Go back to your hotel, Beaumont.

28:55.259 --> 28:57.636
I'm busy, and you're wasting my time.

28:57.638 --> 28:58.970
(IMITATING FREDDIE WOODS):
Break the case.

28:58.972 --> 29:01.373
Use any means possible.
Just bring it home.

29:01.375 --> 29:03.809
You quote Freddie Woods at me again,

29:03.811 --> 29:06.578
and you'll get very hurt
resisting arrest.

29:06.580 --> 29:09.481
I know how to trigger your
hot spot, Agent Kendall,

29:10.107 --> 29:12.568
just like I know how to trigger Brooke's.

29:15.904 --> 29:17.722
That rage you're feeling?

29:17.724 --> 29:19.491
It's the exact same rage
that Brooke has at me

29:19.493 --> 29:20.592
for screwing things up.

29:20.594 --> 29:21.793
Now, you put her in front of me

29:21.795 --> 29:25.091
while she is still raw
and scared, and she'll talk.

29:25.093 --> 29:26.598
If she confesses,

29:26.600 --> 29:28.834
you'll get what you really want:

29:29.470 --> 29:31.703
My head in a noose.

29:34.357 --> 29:35.368
MAXINE: <i>So, Mr. Hearst,</i>

29:35.370 --> 29:36.575
you knew Gerry Reed?

29:36.577 --> 29:39.010
Yeah, Gerry and I were friends,

29:39.012 --> 29:41.079
until I wised up on him.

29:41.471 --> 29:42.581
You “wised up”?

29:42.583 --> 29:45.417
Caught him trying to
make a copy of these.

29:46.294 --> 29:48.088
Those keys access the morgue here?

29:49.187 --> 29:50.990
He didn't get hold of them.

29:50.992 --> 29:52.592
I mean, he might have wanted to,

29:52.594 --> 29:55.595
but, uh, I kept a real
tight hold, believe me.

29:55.597 --> 29:57.363
Mr. Hearst, just wondering...

29:57.365 --> 29:59.823
have any cadavers gone missing recently?

30:00.769 --> 30:02.659
- Well, how do you know that?
- (SCOFFS)

30:06.522 --> 30:08.908
You get my husband killed
and me arrested.

30:08.910 --> 30:10.910
Some negotiator you are.

30:10.912 --> 30:12.378
I said I couldn't negotiate blind.

30:12.380 --> 30:14.394
It only works with full disclosure.

30:14.396 --> 30:17.183
I told you everything,
you son of a bitch.

30:17.185 --> 30:18.284
You said you didn't have an affair

30:18.286 --> 30:19.986
- with your husband's brother.
- I didn't!

30:19.988 --> 30:21.454
No matter what <i> he</i> thinks.

30:21.456 --> 30:22.655
ERIC: But you wanted to.

30:23.388 --> 30:24.858
MAXINE: <i>Gerry befriends Joe,</i>

30:24.860 --> 30:27.227
makes a copy of the keys,
and steals a body.

30:27.229 --> 30:28.795
And uses his I.T. skills

30:28.797 --> 30:31.131
to change his dental records
so they come up a match.

30:31.133 --> 30:34.134
That's why the kidnapper asked
for Gerry's medication.

30:34.136 --> 30:36.770
Misdirection, to strengthen the illusion

30:36.772 --> 30:37.971
he was genuinely captive.

30:37.973 --> 30:39.572
Having earlier doctored Brooke's laptop

30:39.574 --> 30:42.575
with fake intel because
he genuinely thought

30:42.577 --> 30:44.711
his wife was having
an affair with his brother.

30:45.202 --> 30:47.213
How do we prove all this?

30:47.215 --> 30:50.216
Without any hard evidence,
we'll all still be indicted,

30:50.218 --> 30:52.352
and Gerry will be free
to do whatever he wants.

30:52.354 --> 30:53.987
Unless Eric can get Brooke to talk.

30:56.505 --> 30:57.891
Don't lie to me.

30:57.893 --> 30:59.492
I'm not lying!

31:04.513 --> 31:08.034
One night, six months ago,

31:08.036 --> 31:09.636
we'd had too much wine.

31:09.638 --> 31:11.437
Gerry was out.

31:11.439 --> 31:13.916
Michael initiated, but I was
the one who stopped it.

31:13.918 --> 31:15.528
You expect me to believe that?

31:15.530 --> 31:16.810
I already told you.

31:16.812 --> 31:18.945
- I loved my husband.
- ERIC: Gerry knew that.

31:18.947 --> 31:20.947
He just didn't believe it, did he?

31:22.197 --> 31:24.741
He could be a little paranoid.

31:25.487 --> 31:27.987
- I wonder why.
- Because he was insecure.

31:27.989 --> 31:29.856
I couldn't ever

31:29.858 --> 31:33.793
convince him that his passion
and his brilliance

31:33.795 --> 31:36.563
and his crazy recklessness

31:36.565 --> 31:40.233
meant that I didn't ever want
anyone else.

31:43.772 --> 31:46.339
When my baby's born, take a DNA test.

31:46.341 --> 31:49.142
You'll see. It's Gerry's.

31:50.392 --> 31:52.478
What if Gerry didn't believe that?

31:53.061 --> 31:54.370
What if he thought

31:54.372 --> 31:55.715
that the baby was actually Michael's?

31:55.717 --> 31:57.483
I mean, on top of all his other failures,

31:57.485 --> 31:59.419
that kind of betrayal?

31:59.943 --> 32:01.054
He would've had to pay you both

32:01.056 --> 32:02.555
back for that, wouldn't he?

32:02.557 --> 32:03.958
What the hell are you talking about?

32:03.960 --> 32:06.159
Mrs. Reed didn't kill her husband.

32:06.161 --> 32:07.827
No one did,

32:07.829 --> 32:10.530
because Gerry isn't dead.

32:10.532 --> 32:13.068
He staged his kidnapping

32:13.070 --> 32:15.501
to steal Michael's money,
and then he set up Brooke

32:15.503 --> 32:18.371
by faking that hit man exchange
on her laptop.

32:18.373 --> 32:20.139
Gerry is the one

32:20.141 --> 32:22.542
- you should be chasing.
- You've lost your mind.

32:22.883 --> 32:24.551
We have a body.

32:25.947 --> 32:27.180
Dental records.

32:27.182 --> 32:28.781
I know. All faked.

32:28.783 --> 32:30.516
This interview is terminated.

32:31.933 --> 32:33.533
Get her out of here.

32:34.368 --> 32:36.222
You have to listen to him, please.

32:36.224 --> 32:39.330
If Gerry's alive, everything he's done...

32:39.332 --> 32:41.194
It's not enough.

32:58.092 --> 33:00.213
You ordering a DNA test on the body?

33:00.215 --> 33:01.547
Don't press your luck.

33:01.549 --> 33:03.049
Look, if Freddie Woods was your mentor,

33:03.051 --> 33:05.592
you're too good an agent
to look the other way.

33:06.635 --> 33:09.214
So now you're gonna kiss my ass.
Is that it?

33:09.216 --> 33:11.758
All right, all right, let-let's
just pretend for a minute

33:11.760 --> 33:13.893
that I'm right and Gerry
did fake his own death.

33:14.434 --> 33:15.762
If he wanted his wife

33:15.764 --> 33:17.997
in prison, you think all he'd take

33:17.999 --> 33:19.432
from his brother was his money?

33:19.434 --> 33:21.768
He would want a more
terminal payback than that.

33:21.770 --> 33:24.090
You think he's gonna try
to kill Michael Reed.

33:24.092 --> 33:25.805
Given Gerry's pathological paranoia,

33:25.807 --> 33:27.273
I'd say it's the only logical conclusion.

33:27.275 --> 33:29.542
I mean, this was always
a three-part plan.

33:29.950 --> 33:31.961
- Three parts.
- One:

33:31.963 --> 33:33.546
Fake his kidnapping
to bankrupt his brother

33:33.548 --> 33:34.547
and pocket the money.

33:36.351 --> 33:38.518
witness his death and then
pay for their betrayal

33:38.520 --> 33:40.920
BY THREE: Sending Brooke to prison

33:40.922 --> 33:42.255
and Michael to the morgue.

33:42.257 --> 33:43.823
And you want me to send a man
to Michael's house.

33:43.825 --> 33:45.091
- Is that it?
- No.

33:45.093 --> 33:46.159
Gerry will want his brother's death

33:46.161 --> 33:47.260
to look like a suicide

33:47.262 --> 33:48.661
so he can still walk away.

33:48.663 --> 33:49.929
You go in guns blazing,

33:49.931 --> 33:51.988
and he'll kill Michael and himself.

33:52.437 --> 33:54.233
It's all still conjecture.

33:54.235 --> 33:57.686
You either bring me some proof,
or you're finished.

33:59.104 --> 34:00.840
If I can't save Michael...

34:01.255 --> 34:03.122
I'm finished anyway.

35:17.623 --> 35:19.661
begging you for scraps while
you're stealing my wife.

35:19.663 --> 35:22.403
- Gerry, please, just put...
- Shut up.

35:22.405 --> 35:23.859
Be quiet.

35:23.860 --> 35:25.994
Okay. All right. We-we kissed.

35:25.996 --> 35:28.029
Okay, we kissed, but that's it.
That's all we did.

35:28.031 --> 35:30.332
I-I didn't mean to hurt you. Okay?

35:30.334 --> 35:32.667
Okay. That's why you're
gonna kill yourself,

35:32.669 --> 35:34.135
because of all the remorse you feel

35:34.137 --> 35:35.503

One night, six months ago.

37:39.728 --> 37:40.893
And then, five weeks later,
she's pregnant?

Please, let him out.

how to ruin their lives
without ruining mine.

Your life is not ruined.
