WEBVTT

00:03.136 --> 00:05.804
Thanks for coming.
Would you like a receipt with that?

00:07.073 --> 00:08.638
Don't forget to take a mint.

00:11.878 --> 00:14.314
Thanks for coming.
Would you like a receipt with that?

00:14.414 --> 00:16.206
Don't forget to take a mint.

00:19.652 --> 00:22.088
Thanks for coming.
Would you like a receipt with that?

00:22.188 --> 00:23.946
Don't forget to take a mint.

00:26.592 --> 00:28.987
Thanks for coming.
Would you like a receipt with that?

00:30.363 --> 00:32.087
Don't forget to take a mint.

00:46.813 --> 00:49.538
Thanks for coming.
Would you like a receipt with that?

00:51.084 --> 00:52.444
Don't forget to...

00:55.822 --> 00:59.225
Somebody, I can't remember who it was,

00:59.325 --> 01:03.229
once said that every man's life
ends the same way.

01:03.329 --> 01:06.599
It's only the details
of how he lived and died

01:06.699 --> 01:09.527
that distinguishes him
from the next guy.

01:13.039 --> 01:15.901
...super waterbed blowout.
No mattress is...

01:37.697 --> 01:39.165
For most people nowadays,

01:39.265 --> 01:41.831
the American dream doesn't really exist.

01:42.635 --> 01:46.566
For my friend, Ray Tuckby,
it was no different.

02:07.093 --> 02:12.094
Trona, California, had to be about
the weirdest place I ever saw...

02:13.299 --> 02:17.170
like being on the moon
yet less than three hours from L.A.,

02:17.270 --> 02:20.098
and it could get hot as hell...

02:20.940 --> 02:23.734
in the summer, up to 130.

02:33.186 --> 02:36.321
At one time,
Trona was a town full of promise.

02:38.858 --> 02:41.253
That promise had long been forgotten...

02:42.128 --> 02:45.064
along with the movie theater,
the Ford dealership,

02:45.164 --> 02:46.626
and the swimming hole.

02:49.669 --> 02:52.429
But it was still where Ray called home.

03:01.514 --> 03:04.205
Now, home for most people
was a place of refuge.

03:05.017 --> 03:07.208
For Ray, it was anything but that.

03:08.020 --> 03:10.154
In fact, it was just the opposite.

03:11.057 --> 03:13.493
Sixty for a sack. You got three.

03:13.593 --> 03:14.694
All right.

03:14.794 --> 03:16.256
What's it gonna cost?

03:17.597 --> 03:19.162
Hold on a second there, Ray.

03:22.401 --> 03:23.590
All right.

03:27.173 --> 03:28.975
Afternoon there, Dirk.

03:29.075 --> 03:30.476
You're late on the rent, Ray.

03:30.576 --> 03:31.611
Really?

03:31.711 --> 03:33.279
Damn, Dirk. Sorry about that.

03:33.379 --> 03:36.182
I'll fly a check on over to you
as soon as I get cleaned up.

03:36.282 --> 03:38.284
Don't make a habit out of it.

03:38.384 --> 03:40.017
You know I got a short temper.

03:45.591 --> 03:49.887
It was pretty much the same routine
day in and day out for Ray...

03:50.730 --> 03:53.694
punch in at 9:00, out at 5:00.

03:55.201 --> 03:59.428
By 5:30, he'd arrive
at his house on Cyril Street...

04:00.306 --> 04:04.636
and every day, the welcome wagon
was there to greet him.

04:06.746 --> 04:08.607
You! Ray!

04:09.882 --> 04:11.017
Oh, howdy, Selma.

04:11.117 --> 04:13.886
You might want to think about
cleanin' up your yard.

04:13.986 --> 04:17.553
Goddamn turtle
turned this place into a shithole.

04:22.728 --> 04:25.298
Sure thing, Selma.
I'll get on it over the weekend.

04:25.398 --> 04:28.267
You think you're such a big shot,
Mr. Something Special?

04:28.367 --> 04:29.625
Doubt it.

04:36.175 --> 04:37.865
Ignore that old hag.

04:40.112 --> 04:41.481
Want a swig?

04:41.581 --> 04:42.648
Nah. Thanks, Den.

04:42.748 --> 04:46.850
Ray, how's Stevie there doin'?

04:47.653 --> 04:48.855
He's good.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.520
Yo, Steve-o!

04:51.557 --> 04:52.951
Me and you, buddy.

04:54.060 --> 04:55.495
Take care now.

04:55.595 --> 04:57.092
Always do, Ray.

04:58.397 --> 04:59.791
Always do.

05:05.905 --> 05:07.273
Hi, Charlene.

05:07.373 --> 05:08.374
Hello, Ray.

05:08.474 --> 05:09.842
How was your day?

05:09.942 --> 05:11.302
Just fine.

05:14.847 --> 05:16.742
Any thoughts on dinner?

05:17.617 --> 05:19.808
I didn't know what you'd want.

05:21.020 --> 05:22.388
Oh well, then.

05:22.488 --> 05:25.191
How 'bout I head on over
to the Rite-Valu and get us some?

05:25.291 --> 05:27.186
What an inspired notion.

05:30.463 --> 05:32.153
Any ideas?

05:33.332 --> 05:34.521
Pizza.

05:35.668 --> 05:37.130
Pizza's fine, Ray.

05:38.771 --> 05:40.404
Want to come with?

05:46.078 --> 05:48.974
Might be nice for you
to get out once in a while.

05:49.815 --> 05:52.585
Let's just say that Ray's wife Charlene

05:52.685 --> 05:54.220
had some issues,

05:54.320 --> 05:57.957
which meant he handled
most of the domestic duties,

05:58.057 --> 06:00.953
like the daily trips
to the local market.

06:02.595 --> 06:07.066
The Rite-Valu didn't have much,
but it did have one thing...

06:07.166 --> 06:09.334
Nora McCalley.

06:18.911 --> 06:19.879
Hey, Nora.

06:19.979 --> 06:22.114
Oh, hey, Ray.

06:22.214 --> 06:24.116
That delivery of
frozen pizzas come in yet?

06:24.216 --> 06:25.618
Supposed to have gotten them today,

06:25.718 --> 06:28.284
but Cliff's engine blew up
on his way back from town.

06:29.188 --> 06:31.457
Guess I'll go for the Dinty Moore, then.

06:31.557 --> 06:32.959
That's heat-and-serve, ain't it?

06:33.059 --> 06:35.161
Sure is. Over on aisle five.

06:35.261 --> 06:36.519
Right.

06:41.867 --> 06:44.604
You notice that Chevron station
around the bend's nearly done?

06:44.704 --> 06:45.671
It's a pretty sight.

06:45.771 --> 06:48.007
About the prettiest thing
in this whole county.

06:48.107 --> 06:50.409
- They puttin' in a mini-mart?
- Yep.

06:50.509 --> 06:52.878
If that doesn't do in this place,
I don't know what will.

06:52.978 --> 06:54.113
Well...

06:54.213 --> 06:57.116
I'm sure they're not gonna have
fresh fruit and things.

06:57.216 --> 06:59.407
Or, for that matter, you.

07:01.087 --> 07:02.845
Oh, that'll be $4.10.

07:03.789 --> 07:05.047
Five.

07:05.925 --> 07:07.456
Keep the change.

07:08.461 --> 07:10.296
Now, Ray, you gotta stop doing that.

07:10.396 --> 07:12.298
It's my pleasure, Nora.

07:12.398 --> 07:15.192
If you're not the most
generous man I've ever met!

07:18.337 --> 07:22.530
Well, guess I'll be seeing
you... tomorrow.

07:23.909 --> 07:25.235
I'll be here.

07:33.619 --> 07:35.955
How many cars
did you process today, dear?

07:36.055 --> 07:37.517
146.

07:38.424 --> 07:39.659
Quite a lot, isn't it?

07:39.759 --> 07:41.427
Heavier than normal.

07:41.527 --> 07:42.921
And how was your day?

07:43.829 --> 07:46.799
I found a half-off coupon
on Bounty paper towels

07:46.899 --> 07:48.794
with no expiration date.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.203
Isn't that something?

07:51.303 --> 07:53.172
I guess it is, yeah.

07:53.272 --> 07:54.907
What about you, son?

07:55.007 --> 07:58.844
I busted some windows
on a couple of houses down the street.

07:58.944 --> 08:01.747
I want to burn down
that shitbox up the street

08:01.847 --> 08:04.016
that that dead guy croaked in.

08:04.116 --> 08:05.751
Now, son, we talked about this.

08:05.851 --> 08:07.386
You got to work on your anger.

08:07.486 --> 08:09.950
I wouldn't have any
if you took me to Betsy's.

08:10.756 --> 08:11.991
We'll see, son.

08:12.091 --> 08:13.893
All you say is "Soon, son."

08:13.993 --> 08:16.320
Do I look like I'm getting any younger?

08:19.165 --> 08:20.559
I'll get it.

08:25.538 --> 08:26.727
Hello?

08:27.973 --> 08:30.141
No, this is his son Edward.

08:34.113 --> 08:35.506
Okay.

08:38.951 --> 08:40.453
Who was that, dear?

08:40.553 --> 08:41.913
Aunt Penny.

08:48.861 --> 08:50.460
What did she want?

08:51.463 --> 08:55.724
Grandma's in the hospital,
in a "comma" or something.

09:00.439 --> 09:02.664
I wasn't really listening.

09:05.411 --> 09:09.315
This looks like a fun one, Ma.
Pigs in a Twinkie.

09:09.415 --> 09:13.176
"Thinly slice one end off each Twinkie.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.922
"Stuff a cooked sausage
into each Twinkie.

09:17.022 --> 09:19.725
"Place the Twinkies
in a shallow baking dish

09:19.825 --> 09:23.162
"and bake for 10 minutes
or until the Twinkies are warm.

09:23.262 --> 09:25.293
Serve warm with syrup."

09:26.098 --> 09:27.199
Penny?

09:27.299 --> 09:28.400
Hey, Ray.

09:28.500 --> 09:29.568
Oh, hey, Eddie.

09:29.668 --> 09:32.037
I came as soon as I heard.
What happened, anyhow?

09:32.137 --> 09:35.274
Well, I think she was trimming
a hangnail over the toilet,

09:35.374 --> 09:37.804
passed out,
hit her head on the porcelain.

09:38.677 --> 09:41.413
I been here all day
trying to get her conscious enough

09:41.513 --> 09:43.442
to give me that meringue recipe.

09:46.118 --> 09:48.788
Hey, Ma. How you feeling?

09:48.888 --> 09:50.422
You comfortable?

09:50.522 --> 09:51.891
Guys.

09:51.991 --> 09:54.226
Oh, here we go.

09:54.326 --> 09:55.528
Mark.

09:55.628 --> 09:57.363
Hey, Uncle Mark.

09:57.463 --> 09:59.221
Hey.

10:01.400 --> 10:04.203
The fruits from my loins.

10:04.303 --> 10:05.271
Ma!

10:05.371 --> 10:08.440
Your meringue recipe...
three parts lemon, two parts sugar?

10:08.540 --> 10:09.729
Ma?

10:10.743 --> 10:12.011
Oh, Mama...

10:12.111 --> 10:13.778
Mama.

10:15.014 --> 10:17.850
He's been like this all day.

10:17.950 --> 10:19.310
Hey, Mark.

10:20.119 --> 10:21.911
How's business going?

10:22.721 --> 10:24.183
Pretty darn good.

10:25.057 --> 10:27.860
Introduced a new flavor
this week from Poland,

10:27.960 --> 10:30.129
Champagne Silk.

10:30.229 --> 10:32.090
It goes down real easy.

10:32.898 --> 10:34.066
Sounds great.

10:34.166 --> 10:37.803
Sauerkraut is, without question,
the superfood of the future.

10:37.903 --> 10:39.229
Daddy!

10:41.106 --> 10:42.708
Hi, everyone.

10:42.808 --> 10:44.839
- Hey, Joanne.
- Joanne.

10:45.644 --> 10:48.414
Mark, can I have
a private word with you, please?

10:48.514 --> 10:51.350
Joanne, get back in the car.

10:51.450 --> 10:52.751
Your kids need you.

10:52.851 --> 10:54.553
You are coming home this instant!

10:54.653 --> 10:56.582
Would you shut them up, please?

10:57.990 --> 10:59.358
Tommy, no!

10:59.458 --> 11:02.491
Those kids have got germs!
Get them out of this room!

11:07.399 --> 11:13.138
As we all know, family gatherings
can be quite taxing at times,

11:13.238 --> 11:17.397
but everything in Trona was taxing...
that was nothin'new.

11:18.210 --> 11:20.579
Dirk and his posse, for some time,

11:20.679 --> 11:23.939
had a hold on most things in town...

11:24.917 --> 11:26.552
but lately, it seemed that hold

11:26.652 --> 11:30.481
was getting closer
and closer to home for Ray.

11:33.425 --> 11:34.827
Afternoon, Spoonie.

11:34.927 --> 11:36.185
Toll road.

11:37.029 --> 11:38.130
How's that?

11:38.230 --> 11:39.761
Five bucks to pass.

11:40.866 --> 11:42.034
You're joshin', right?

11:42.134 --> 11:44.169
Do I look like I'm joshin' you, retard?

11:44.269 --> 11:47.768
Five bones or I beat the crap
out of your kid every day next week.

12:00.819 --> 12:02.384
Don't hurt my boy, you hear?

12:03.188 --> 12:04.685
He never did anything to you.

12:06.325 --> 12:07.860
Good call, Ray-gay.

12:07.960 --> 12:10.424
I might kick his ass
anyhow just for fun.

12:23.675 --> 12:25.678
Dirk! Hey, Dirk!

12:25.778 --> 12:27.279
Why you keep hounding me, woman?

12:27.379 --> 12:29.415
I'm working on my bike.
Can't you see that?

12:29.515 --> 12:32.084
All you guys shut your mouths
and go in the house before...

12:32.184 --> 12:34.750
Kid's a modern-day Charles Manson.

12:54.239 --> 12:56.839
You ever notice
how Dirk gets all them chicks?

12:58.410 --> 13:00.510
He ain't as good-looking as me, is he?

13:01.580 --> 13:03.515
He's got the devil in him, Ed.

13:03.615 --> 13:06.283
Who cares when you're that successful?

13:07.086 --> 13:08.854
Who wants dessert?

13:08.954 --> 13:12.091
Dessert? What a nice twist.

13:12.191 --> 13:13.926
Oh, I don't think we have anything.

13:14.026 --> 13:17.196
I was just interested
to see who might be...

13:17.296 --> 13:19.327
interested.

13:21.567 --> 13:23.462
I'll have a look anyway.

13:30.275 --> 13:33.312
Hey, Dad, could we
go get my rocks off tonight?

13:33.412 --> 13:36.648
Son, I don't like that kind of talk.
You know better than that.

13:36.748 --> 13:39.685
You keep saying you're going
to take me and never deliver.

13:39.785 --> 13:41.453
You're just a bullshit artist.

13:41.553 --> 13:42.879
Who's an artist?

13:45.023 --> 13:47.054
Guess what I found in the freezer?

13:52.131 --> 13:54.196
What do you say to your mother, son?

13:56.034 --> 13:59.203
Gee, thanks, Ma. This looks delicious.

14:13.919 --> 14:15.888
Now, Betsy's wasn't exactly

14:15.988 --> 14:18.457
where Ray had hoped Eddie
would lose his virtue,

14:18.557 --> 14:22.227
but Ray still owed his son
a graduation present

14:22.327 --> 14:25.697
and decided it was probably
as good a gift as any.

14:25.797 --> 14:27.466
Evening, ladies.

14:27.566 --> 14:29.334
What can we do for you, sugar?

14:29.434 --> 14:30.736
This here's my son Ed.

14:30.836 --> 14:35.474
Need to get his cherry popped.
I don't want that on my head.

14:35.574 --> 14:37.503
But he's a good, clean kid, honest.

14:38.644 --> 14:42.507
$50 for the full treatment,
and I'll be real gentle.

14:45.384 --> 14:47.019
Can't I have 'em both?

14:47.119 --> 14:49.421
Let's not get ahead of ourselves, son.

14:49.521 --> 14:51.657
Can you do $35? That's all I got.

14:51.757 --> 14:53.258
Yeah, okay.

14:53.358 --> 14:56.995
Meet me around the corner
at the Aloha, room 107.

14:57.095 --> 14:59.092
Give me a ten-minute head start.

15:00.799 --> 15:03.058
You sure this is
how you want to lose it, honey?

15:03.869 --> 15:05.730
Don't worry about me, blood.

15:06.738 --> 15:08.963
Just lay back and enjoy the ride.

15:09.908 --> 15:12.744
Shit, I might have to watch this.

15:12.844 --> 15:14.807
Appreciate it, ma'am.

15:16.148 --> 15:17.906
Any time you wanna come back...

15:45.644 --> 15:48.335
Well, this is a big day for you, son.

15:49.381 --> 15:50.570
I guess.

15:51.383 --> 15:54.553
Remember what I told you.
Always be a gentleman.

15:54.653 --> 15:57.356
Never go poking around
without asking if it's okay first.

15:57.456 --> 15:59.590
They're human beings too, these whores.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.157
Brush your teeth today?

16:03.695 --> 16:04.987
I don't remember.

16:05.797 --> 16:07.055
Shower?

16:08.333 --> 16:09.801
Couple nights ago.

16:09.901 --> 16:12.501
Well... that'll do ya.

16:13.405 --> 16:16.073
Sounds to me like
you're ready for the big plunge.

16:17.276 --> 16:18.877
It's about time.

16:18.977 --> 16:22.169
Most of the guys in school
got laid by third grade.

16:23.015 --> 16:25.951
Ed, we all march to the sound
of our own drummer.

16:26.051 --> 16:28.082
Don't ever forget that.

16:29.488 --> 16:30.916
Okay, then.

16:34.326 --> 16:37.796
Here's the cash and some rubbers

16:37.896 --> 16:41.930
your Uncle Mark brought me back
from the Grenada conflict in '83.

16:44.870 --> 16:46.471
You sure they're still good?

16:46.571 --> 16:48.740
U.S. Government issue.

16:48.840 --> 16:50.701
I think they got Kevlar in 'em.

16:51.743 --> 16:54.213
Okay, I gotta run by the hospital,

16:54.313 --> 16:55.814
check on your grandma.

16:55.914 --> 16:57.775
I'll see you in an hour, okay?

16:59.217 --> 17:00.475
Yeah?

17:02.421 --> 17:04.088
Good luck, son.

18:15.060 --> 18:16.989
You want some music?

18:29.341 --> 18:30.701
You okay, honey?

18:32.911 --> 18:34.976
I don't want to do this.

18:36.415 --> 18:38.276
You mean have sex?

18:41.019 --> 18:45.713
I kept buggin' my dad
so he'd think I was normal.

18:48.126 --> 18:51.090
It's not that I don't have
any sex drive or nothin'.

18:52.764 --> 18:53.899
It's just...

18:53.999 --> 18:57.134
You want the first time to be
with someone you care about.

19:02.974 --> 19:04.641
I wish I'd waited.

19:08.947 --> 19:10.315
Where are you from?

19:10.415 --> 19:12.117
Born in Mobile,

19:12.217 --> 19:14.486
came out here
a few months ago with my mama.

19:14.586 --> 19:16.378
She's what you call a medium.

19:17.589 --> 19:18.949
What's that?

19:19.758 --> 19:22.017
Well, you know, like, a psychic.

19:22.828 --> 19:25.030
Someone who predicts things.

19:25.130 --> 19:27.599
Anyhow, me and her had a falling out,

19:27.699 --> 19:30.502
as they say, so I hit the trail,

19:30.602 --> 19:32.929
and now I live in this here motel.

19:35.440 --> 19:37.267
Did she predict that?

19:38.844 --> 19:40.375
I don't know.

19:47.252 --> 19:49.181
You want to go out sometime?

19:51.490 --> 19:52.491
Really?

19:52.591 --> 19:57.854
Get a meal, or some... something...

19:59.764 --> 20:01.124
Yeah.

20:03.869 --> 20:05.661
Let me give you my card.

20:06.471 --> 20:11.074
If you give me 24-hour notice,
I can arrange for a night off.

20:14.179 --> 20:15.447
How do you say your name?

20:15.547 --> 20:17.044
Rochelle.

20:20.652 --> 20:22.149
Cool.

20:23.588 --> 20:26.725
Dr. Habibi, please report to room 243.

20:26.825 --> 20:28.322
Dr. Habibi.

20:32.163 --> 20:34.433
Dr. Richards, please report to the O.R.

20:34.533 --> 20:36.200
Dr. Richards.

20:57.689 --> 20:59.447
Afternoon, Spoonie.

21:01.159 --> 21:03.428
Let's go. Cough it up, Ray-gay.

21:03.528 --> 21:05.564
You owes me
from last time, don't forget.

21:05.664 --> 21:07.092
That I do.

21:12.037 --> 21:13.738
Here you be.

21:13.838 --> 21:15.006
See that?

21:15.106 --> 21:18.443
See how easy things is
when you understand who's boss?

21:18.543 --> 21:19.971
Oh, yeah.

21:30.388 --> 21:34.046
You dumb... son of a bitch.

21:40.465 --> 21:42.067
Well, lookie who's home early.

21:42.167 --> 21:43.502
Yo, Ray!

21:43.602 --> 21:47.973
Double guards to the finish line.
Come to the yard. Come to the yard.

21:48.073 --> 21:50.468
- I got fancy wine coolers, man.
- Hey, guys.

21:55.880 --> 21:57.240
Hey, Ed, what's up?

21:58.283 --> 22:00.041
That Uncle Mark's car outside?

22:01.486 --> 22:03.119
Where's your mother?

22:04.723 --> 22:07.483
Son, I asked you a question.

22:17.335 --> 22:19.170
- Touch my balls.
- You send me!

22:19.270 --> 22:20.372
You send me.

22:20.472 --> 22:22.908
- Touch my balls.
- You send me.

22:23.008 --> 22:25.802
Yeah! Touch my goddamned balls!

22:33.618 --> 22:34.910
Charlene?

22:37.155 --> 22:38.379
Mark?

22:40.659 --> 22:43.953
Dear... you're home early.

22:44.896 --> 22:47.832
How was your day?

22:47.932 --> 22:49.190
Hey, Ray.

22:52.470 --> 22:56.197
Charlene, can I have a word with you?

23:13.725 --> 23:15.859
Mind givin' your mom and me a moment?

23:27.939 --> 23:30.403
Mark's been pretty tore up
about your mom.

23:32.077 --> 23:34.404
He just needed
a little compassion is all.

23:38.550 --> 23:41.344
You never were very understanding,
were you, Ray?

23:43.455 --> 23:45.122
This been goin' on a while?

23:46.624 --> 23:47.984
Charlene.

23:49.461 --> 23:50.787
Since...

23:53.598 --> 23:57.234
'bout nine months before Eddie was born.

24:00.538 --> 24:02.296
The boy know?

24:05.376 --> 24:07.271
I would imagine.

24:13.318 --> 24:16.385
Why'd you force me to be with you
if I wasn't his father?

24:17.655 --> 24:19.914
Damn, Charlene, I wasn't even 18.

24:24.562 --> 24:26.957
All them pretty girls wanted you.

24:31.770 --> 24:33.870
You need to leave, Charlene.

25:03.802 --> 25:05.492
That you, Ray?

25:10.642 --> 25:12.610
What are you doin' out here
all by yourself?

25:12.710 --> 25:13.912
Not much.

25:14.012 --> 25:16.181
You want me to open back up
so you can get a soda?

25:16.281 --> 25:18.349
Got my paycheck today.
It'll be my treat.

25:18.449 --> 25:19.980
No. Thanks, though.

25:20.985 --> 25:22.277
You okay?

25:23.288 --> 25:27.058
This oughta make you feel better...
I got your favorite dessert in today.

25:27.158 --> 25:28.393
Banana instant pudding.

25:28.493 --> 25:31.329
I hid half a case for you
in personal sundries,

25:31.429 --> 25:33.231
aisle two, behind the deodorant.

25:33.331 --> 25:36.234
Should be quite awhile
before anybody finds it.

25:36.334 --> 25:37.936
Catch my meaning?

25:38.036 --> 25:39.931
That's awful sweet of you.

25:41.639 --> 25:44.330
Oh, Ray, what is it? Tell me.

25:45.143 --> 25:46.678
Just some trouble at home,

25:46.778 --> 25:49.414
me and Charlene stuff.

25:49.514 --> 25:51.416
That's horrible.

25:51.516 --> 25:54.285
I just want to sit here for a while,
if you don't mind.

25:54.385 --> 25:55.520
'Course.

25:55.620 --> 25:57.522
I better skedaddle, anyway.

25:57.622 --> 25:59.624
Don't wanna miss "The Big Spin" on TV.

25:59.724 --> 26:02.119
I came within two numbers last time.

26:03.294 --> 26:05.396
Well... 'night, Ray.

26:05.496 --> 26:07.186
Goodnight.

27:30.915 --> 27:32.173
Yo, Ray.

27:33.785 --> 27:35.816
Dirk shut off the power again.

27:36.955 --> 27:38.452
Did you pay the rent, Den?

27:39.357 --> 27:41.159
My welfares check's late.

27:41.259 --> 27:42.594
You gotta pay the man, Den.

27:42.694 --> 27:45.630
It affects the whole block
if even one household ain't current.

27:45.730 --> 27:47.765
You know how he is that way.

27:47.865 --> 27:51.236
That punk... he deserves
to have his face rearranged,

27:51.336 --> 27:53.304
stealin' our electricity.

27:53.404 --> 27:55.629
It's hotter than hell in there!

28:16.961 --> 28:18.822
Okay, good to go.

28:20.665 --> 28:22.196
You can do it, Char.

28:23.234 --> 28:25.595
"One small step for man" type deal.

28:26.404 --> 28:27.372
No, I can't.

28:27.472 --> 28:31.301
It's... for... the... best!

28:32.276 --> 28:34.842
Yeah. See how easy that was?

28:37.281 --> 28:38.349
You look so pretty.

28:38.449 --> 28:40.218
You look so pretty in the sunshine.

28:40.318 --> 28:41.886
- We did it.
- You sure did.

28:41.986 --> 28:43.354
You did it all by yourself.

28:43.454 --> 28:45.451
We did it. Oh, my God.

28:55.633 --> 28:57.767
Funny thing about change...

28:58.703 --> 29:01.838
it's kinda like pullin' off a bandage.

29:02.840 --> 29:07.739
Hurts like hell when you do it,
but you always feel better after.

29:27.198 --> 29:28.490
Yo, Ray.

29:29.801 --> 29:34.305
Was that Eddie I seen... headin' off
in your brother's car awhile back?

29:34.405 --> 29:36.307
That'd be him.

29:36.407 --> 29:38.666
Who was that woman with him?

29:40.011 --> 29:41.112
Charlene.

29:41.212 --> 29:42.401
Serious?

29:43.281 --> 29:45.847
Lord, I can't remember
the last time I seen her.

29:47.218 --> 29:48.749
She don't get out much.

29:49.687 --> 29:51.218
Not a lot, no.

29:53.224 --> 29:54.721
You all right, Ray?

29:57.795 --> 29:59.764
You know if you ever
need someone to talk to,

29:59.864 --> 30:01.759
you got a friend right here.

30:02.800 --> 30:04.524
Just like that night in '89.

30:05.336 --> 30:06.571
Who made that key block,

30:06.671 --> 30:08.706
time runnin' out, you sprintin' upfield?

30:08.806 --> 30:10.408
You did, Den.

30:10.508 --> 30:12.266
A thing of beauty that was.

30:13.077 --> 30:14.938
Me and you, Ray.

30:15.746 --> 30:17.971
We won that game together, we did.

30:20.785 --> 30:22.253
Pay your rent, Den.

30:22.353 --> 30:24.180
Yeah. I know.

30:28.626 --> 30:31.496
That's good, now stabilize it
so I can see it better.

30:31.596 --> 30:34.399
Okay. Yeah, now... now...
now just kinda...

30:34.499 --> 30:35.800
I've never met a guy

30:35.900 --> 30:37.902
who picked up trash from the roadside

30:38.002 --> 30:39.604
who wasn't in a work program.

30:39.704 --> 30:42.340
Excuse me. This your place?

30:42.440 --> 30:43.541
Yeah, I guess it is.

30:43.641 --> 30:46.511
Just wondering if it'd be okay
to dump this trash in your bins.

30:46.611 --> 30:47.612
Oh, yeah, no problem.

30:47.712 --> 30:50.710
But that's what I found
endearing about Ray.

30:51.649 --> 30:53.017
At least he was tryin'.

30:53.117 --> 30:55.153
You got it, boss.

30:55.253 --> 30:56.320
I don't know.

30:56.420 --> 30:58.689
Everybody in town
keeps talkin' about this place.

30:58.789 --> 31:00.391
Yeah? You live around here?

31:00.491 --> 31:02.215
Yep, just around the bend.

31:03.794 --> 31:05.363
Is there any traffic at all?

31:05.463 --> 31:06.898
- Hardly ever.
- None, huh?

31:06.998 --> 31:10.292
Except during holidays, sometimes
folks head out to Death Valley.

31:11.702 --> 31:13.271
You own Chevron?

31:13.371 --> 31:14.539
Own it? No.

31:14.639 --> 31:16.441
I'm just an independent operator.

31:16.541 --> 31:18.709
I'm from Bakersfield.
My name's Merl Stryker.

31:18.809 --> 31:20.812
Ray Tuckby. It's a pleasure, Merl.

31:20.912 --> 31:22.280
Welcome to Trona.

31:22.380 --> 31:24.382
Thank you. Yes, it's quite a place here.

31:24.482 --> 31:26.751
I've never seen anything quite like it.

31:26.851 --> 31:31.222
It's just... pretty sorry-ass.

31:31.322 --> 31:33.424
I hope you don't mind, I mean...

31:33.524 --> 31:34.792
nothing grows here.

31:34.892 --> 31:36.727
Well, soil's too poisoned.

31:36.827 --> 31:39.363
Plus, it hasn't rained here
in about forever.

31:39.463 --> 31:42.066
Used to be beautiful,
though, as I remember.

31:42.166 --> 31:46.104
Mid-'80s, state diverted our water
from Owens River to L.A.

31:46.204 --> 31:49.040
The lake dried up,
the chemical companies moved in,

31:49.140 --> 31:50.408
place went to hell.

31:50.508 --> 31:52.676
That's a sad story.

31:53.611 --> 31:56.447
Who's that little fucker
that charges me to get into town?

31:56.547 --> 31:58.282
That'd be Dirk or one of his boys.

31:58.382 --> 32:00.184
They sort of run things around here.

32:00.284 --> 32:01.686
Kids?

32:01.786 --> 32:04.122
They're responsible
for most of the revenue.

32:04.222 --> 32:05.957
He got his own meth lab.

32:06.057 --> 32:07.492
What about the cops?

32:07.592 --> 32:08.893
Ain't none here.

32:08.993 --> 32:12.363
When the state declared this area
a toxic waste site a few years back,

32:12.463 --> 32:14.499
anybody respectable cleared out.

32:14.599 --> 32:17.001
Then they offered
these places at a cut rate.

32:17.101 --> 32:18.936
Dirk near bought up the town.

32:19.036 --> 32:21.739
Story's gettin' sadder and sadder.

32:21.839 --> 32:25.409
Hey, Ray, is there a place
around here to get a cup of joe?

32:25.509 --> 32:27.445
I'm hittin' my morning crash.

32:27.545 --> 32:30.581
Market in town has a coffee pot,
one of them bottomless jobs,

32:30.681 --> 32:33.284
and 'bout the prettiest gal
you'll ever set eyes on.

32:33.384 --> 32:36.553
Oh, yeah? I think that's
where we should go.

32:47.665 --> 32:49.066
- Mornin', Ray.
- Hey, Nora.

32:49.166 --> 32:51.969
This here's Merl Stryker,
owner of that Chevron station.

32:52.069 --> 32:55.139
- Nora McCalley.
- Well, it is an honor, Mr. Stryker.

32:55.239 --> 32:56.240
How do you do, ma'am.

32:56.340 --> 32:58.940
That's quite a place
you're building out there.

32:59.744 --> 33:03.471
Ray was not telling a lie
when he said you are a fox.

33:05.416 --> 33:08.553
Well, maybe in contrast
to the surroundings.

33:08.653 --> 33:10.087
What can I get for you two?

33:10.187 --> 33:11.956
Couple cups of coffee if it's fresh.

33:12.056 --> 33:13.416
Just made a batch.

33:17.295 --> 33:19.964
This place looks like a cyclone hit it.

33:20.064 --> 33:22.466
There's not much in the way of supplies.

33:22.566 --> 33:24.028
We get by basically.

33:24.835 --> 33:25.970
Here you go.

33:26.070 --> 33:28.973
The Cremora's just behind you
on the counter, sir.

33:29.073 --> 33:30.706
Thank you, honeybunch.

33:34.845 --> 33:36.180
Do something with your hair?

33:36.280 --> 33:37.572
Me?

33:46.057 --> 33:47.747
Got any dreams, Ray?

33:53.064 --> 33:54.390
Dreams?

33:55.232 --> 33:56.400
Yeah.

33:56.500 --> 33:59.437
Dreams. A man's got to strive
for something big in life.

33:59.537 --> 34:03.138
Otherwise, he doesn't mean
a rat's ass to himself or society.

34:03.941 --> 34:06.711
To be honest, I basically just
go from one day to the next

34:06.811 --> 34:08.779
trying to feel good about myself.

34:08.879 --> 34:11.382
I'm 58 years old.
I still got big dreams.

34:11.482 --> 34:14.674
Mean to tell me you didn't have
big ones even when you were a kid?

34:16.320 --> 34:17.646
Some.

34:18.522 --> 34:21.726
What about what you
were telling me about before,

34:21.826 --> 34:26.197
how you thought it'd be great
if this area all came back.

34:26.297 --> 34:28.397
That's a big dream of sorts, isn't it?

34:30.967 --> 34:32.498
I guess.

34:35.172 --> 34:37.670
Maybe have that lake
full of trout and bass...

34:39.210 --> 34:42.106
nice outdoor eatery
on that pier down yonder...

34:44.614 --> 34:47.118
a place where people
could get a cold drink,

34:47.217 --> 34:49.079
admire the beauty again.

34:50.521 --> 34:53.690
Now you're talking.
It sounds pretty good to me.

34:59.029 --> 35:00.731
Well, Merl, I gotta get on to work.

35:00.831 --> 35:02.667
Nice to make your acquaintance.

35:02.767 --> 35:04.268
Pleasure was mine.

35:04.368 --> 35:05.899
Thank you for the coffee.

35:06.904 --> 35:08.696
Keep the wheels turning.

35:12.877 --> 35:14.908
There you go.

35:19.150 --> 35:23.087
If you eat a little more food,
you can be sleeping in your own bed.

35:23.187 --> 35:24.649
Won't that be nice?

35:26.590 --> 35:30.590
Yeah, that's it.

35:31.395 --> 35:32.823
It's good, huh?

35:33.764 --> 35:36.364
Vanilla custard, yes indeed.

35:37.802 --> 35:41.665
Yes, that's my good girl.

35:44.208 --> 35:46.774
I want you out of my house.

35:47.645 --> 35:48.903
What, Ma?

35:49.780 --> 35:52.883
Get that crap away from me,
you kiss-ass.

35:52.983 --> 35:57.988
All you want is that meringue recipe,
and it'll never happen.

35:58.088 --> 36:01.392
You couldn't cook
your way out of a Ziploc.

36:01.492 --> 36:04.661
No wonder you could
never hold on to a man.

36:05.463 --> 36:09.827
You're going to end up a lesbian
if you're not one already.

36:10.634 --> 36:12.358
Evening, miss.

36:14.104 --> 36:15.464
Hello.

36:16.807 --> 36:18.509
I hate your guts.

36:18.609 --> 36:20.211
I don't care.

36:20.311 --> 36:23.114
I have never asked you
for one thing, God damn...

36:23.214 --> 36:24.315
Then don't.

36:24.415 --> 36:27.685
You are gonna cough up
that fucking recipe.

36:27.785 --> 36:30.187
Dream on, you old maid.

36:30.287 --> 36:31.889
Don't push me.

36:31.989 --> 36:33.554
Don't push me.

37:06.857 --> 37:09.218
Ma, I brought your favorite.

37:10.995 --> 37:12.287
Ma?

37:13.564 --> 37:14.890
Penny?

37:19.236 --> 37:25.170
For today we are mourning the loss
of two remarkable individuals...

37:26.377 --> 37:30.614
Penny Varrow,
a willful woman of character

37:30.714 --> 37:33.250
who led an independent life,

37:33.350 --> 37:39.223
most recently running a crisis center
for abandoned spouses...

37:39.323 --> 37:41.058
and Ruth Tuckby,

37:41.158 --> 37:46.363
devoted mother, wife,
and local knitting legend,

37:46.463 --> 37:51.302
who strove to make
the lives of those around her richer.

37:51.402 --> 37:54.839
They were both good women

37:54.939 --> 37:59.371
who celebrated their differences
throughout a rocky relationship.

38:01.946 --> 38:05.946
Well, ultimately celebrated them
a little too much, I reckon.

38:13.657 --> 38:15.290
Mark. Mark!

38:22.700 --> 38:23.868
Mark!

38:23.968 --> 38:24.935
Shut up.

38:25.035 --> 38:26.259
- Mark.
- Ray.

38:27.104 --> 38:28.472
Hey, Clem.

38:28.572 --> 38:31.297
I'm... I'm sorry for your loss.

38:32.610 --> 38:36.780
I know this is not the best time
to talk business, but...

38:36.880 --> 38:38.115
That's okay.

38:38.215 --> 38:40.484
The bulk of the estate goes
to you and your brother.

38:40.584 --> 38:42.353
The house, as you may know,

38:42.453 --> 38:44.722
was pretty heavily leveraged
awhile back,

38:44.822 --> 38:48.423
plus she didn't have much
in the way of medical coverage.

38:49.360 --> 38:50.561
Right.

38:50.661 --> 38:54.695
Son, this here's your share.

38:56.700 --> 38:58.235
Thanks for all your help, Clem.

38:58.335 --> 38:59.559
Sorry.

39:00.371 --> 39:02.339
Oh, I forgot to give you this.

39:02.439 --> 39:04.436
Your mama wanted you to have it.

39:06.944 --> 39:08.979
Well, if there's anything else you need,

39:09.079 --> 39:12.112
I'll be in Ridgecrest, bored to tears.

39:40.210 --> 39:43.013
Eddie? You got a minute?

39:43.113 --> 39:44.871
Not today, Ray. I'm busy.

39:46.383 --> 39:48.218
I need to speak to you, son.

39:48.318 --> 39:49.849
R'ch'lle, excuse us.

39:50.654 --> 39:51.912
Here you go.

39:55.826 --> 39:57.050
What is it?

39:57.928 --> 39:59.390
I got something for you.

40:00.064 --> 40:01.365
Like what?

40:01.465 --> 40:02.633
You should have this.

40:02.733 --> 40:05.269
Your grandma
would've wanted it that way.

40:05.369 --> 40:06.729
Go on, take it.

40:11.709 --> 40:13.544
Eleven hundred bucks?

40:13.644 --> 40:14.912
For college.

40:15.012 --> 40:16.679
College?

40:18.582 --> 40:20.417
What the hell's
the matter with you, Ray?

40:20.517 --> 40:23.320
I got better things to do
with this money and my time

40:23.420 --> 40:25.485
than get some stupid education.

40:27.024 --> 40:29.283
Me and R'ch'lle is moving in together.

40:32.029 --> 40:33.719
I just wanted to say that...

40:34.598 --> 40:38.199
even though we both know
you're not my own flesh and blood...

40:39.470 --> 40:41.570
I still love you, son.

40:42.639 --> 40:45.672
Hey, let's get a move on.
I'm gonna be late for work.

40:48.812 --> 40:50.914
Dirk offered me a gig.

40:51.014 --> 40:52.850
I'm finally gonna make some real coin.

40:52.950 --> 40:54.318
That's a dead end, Ed.

40:54.418 --> 40:55.552
Not to me, it ain't.

40:55.652 --> 40:58.719
Ed, this train is leaving the station.

40:59.857 --> 41:01.115
Ed...

41:03.093 --> 41:04.487
I'll see you around.

41:05.429 --> 41:07.431
If you need anything, son,
you let me know.

41:07.531 --> 41:09.858
Yeah. All right.

41:35.359 --> 41:37.661
Dirk's boys held up
the delivery truck again.

41:37.761 --> 41:40.191
All we got left
is Shake 'n Bake, aisle five.

41:40.998 --> 41:43.325
But... we're out of chicken.

41:44.868 --> 41:46.228
These'll do me.

41:47.237 --> 41:49.371
I was going to eat light tonight anyhow.

41:53.744 --> 41:58.347
Pork rinds and a large bag
of ranch-flavored sunflower seeds.

41:59.383 --> 42:00.751
Anything to drink with that?

42:00.851 --> 42:04.077
Nah. Plenty of water in the tap,
I always say.

42:06.323 --> 42:09.326
I bet you could use
a home-cooked meal one of these days.

42:09.426 --> 42:11.287
Yeah, well...

42:17.835 --> 42:19.798
Sorry about you and Charlene...

42:20.637 --> 42:22.065
and your mom...

42:23.407 --> 42:25.006
and Penny.

42:25.909 --> 42:28.412
Trying to look at it as a new beginning.

42:28.512 --> 42:30.304
May take me awhile to get there.

42:31.615 --> 42:34.118
Anyway, thanks
for coming to the funeral.

42:34.218 --> 42:35.385
Saw you sitting in back.

42:35.485 --> 42:37.084
Oh, my pleasure, Ray.

42:38.488 --> 42:40.087
So, what are you doing later?

42:41.391 --> 42:44.027
Later, like... tonight later?

42:44.127 --> 42:46.597
Yeah, for a start.

42:46.697 --> 42:48.899
Well, I'll probably just go home

42:48.999 --> 42:52.965
and sort through all
the death papers and stuff, I guess.

42:53.770 --> 42:54.738
You?

42:54.838 --> 42:58.275
I'd really like to go
into Ridgecrest and see a movie.

42:58.375 --> 43:00.077
- It's been awhile.
- Yeah?

43:00.177 --> 43:03.447
Maybe get a bite after at that
new Arby's folks are talking about?

43:03.547 --> 43:05.916
Oh, yeah. I drove by it a couple times.

43:06.016 --> 43:08.150
Might be worth checking out.

43:14.691 --> 43:17.227
Well... see you soon, Nora.

43:17.327 --> 43:19.051
Hope so, Ray.

44:55.892 --> 44:57.116
Nora.

44:58.462 --> 45:00.430
You wanna go on a date...

45:00.530 --> 45:01.832
with me?

45:01.932 --> 45:05.067
Been waiting 18 years for you to ask.

46:51.274 --> 46:53.243
Where'd you get all this fresh food?

46:53.343 --> 46:56.446
Got up bright and early this morning,
drove special out to Ridgecrest.

46:56.546 --> 46:57.804
Cook it yourself?

46:59.182 --> 47:02.219
That's about the sweetest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

47:02.319 --> 47:04.488
I mean, that is,
if you did do it for me.

47:04.588 --> 47:05.880
I did.

47:08.258 --> 47:11.361
Ray, how come you never got
out of here when you had the chance?

47:11.461 --> 47:13.629
Me? I don't know.

47:14.598 --> 47:17.267
I know you got that offer
a few years back, going to L.A.,

47:17.367 --> 47:19.262
work for that friend of your dad's.

47:20.770 --> 47:22.232
Didn't suit me, I guess.

47:25.375 --> 47:26.735
This is my home.

47:28.011 --> 47:29.473
I used to love it here.

47:31.281 --> 47:32.971
Summers felt endless.

47:33.783 --> 47:35.085
Swimming, fishing,

47:35.185 --> 47:37.945
just being able to breath
all that cool, fresh air.

47:38.822 --> 47:41.616
I hold on to those memories,
a lot of other ones, too.

47:42.859 --> 47:44.361
Like that one in second grade

47:44.461 --> 47:47.397
when Mrs. Kinney took us
on that field trip to this very spot

47:47.497 --> 47:49.833
and I got a baked bean stuck in my nose?

47:49.933 --> 47:51.601
You remember that?

47:51.701 --> 47:53.904
I wouldn't stop crying.

47:54.004 --> 47:56.406
You came right over,
just like a little prince.

47:56.506 --> 47:58.141
You picked me up and you carried me

47:58.241 --> 47:59.738
all the way back to the bus.

48:00.677 --> 48:03.547
I thought it was so romantic...

48:03.647 --> 48:06.016
except maybe that part
about you insisting

48:06.116 --> 48:07.584
on trying to fish the thing out

48:07.684 --> 48:10.053
with one of your dad's pipe cleaners.

48:10.153 --> 48:12.322
Doctor said you nearly
gave me a lobotomy.

48:12.422 --> 48:14.624
Yeah, I managed to block
that out, actually.

48:14.724 --> 48:16.118
Oh, you did?

48:19.462 --> 48:21.198
I thought it was sweet.

48:21.298 --> 48:23.934
How concerned you were about me,
how much you cared.

48:24.034 --> 48:26.327
Yeah, well...

48:28.972 --> 48:30.332
What about you?

48:31.141 --> 48:32.809
Didn't you ever think about leaving?

48:32.909 --> 48:35.112
From time to time.

48:35.212 --> 48:36.947
How come you never did, then?

48:37.047 --> 48:38.949
That cheerleading scholarship to UOP

48:39.049 --> 48:41.149
sure was a big deal
for you to turn down.

48:42.219 --> 48:43.886
A girl has her reasons.

49:04.474 --> 49:06.143
I had a wonderful afternoon, Ray.

49:06.243 --> 49:07.603
Me, too, Nora.

49:08.778 --> 49:10.580
Now, I want you to keep those leftovers.

49:10.680 --> 49:12.682
I made extra
for you to take to work all week.

49:12.782 --> 49:13.783
You sure?

49:13.883 --> 49:16.286
You can't eat packaged food
the rest of your life.

49:16.386 --> 49:18.455
That stuff'll kill you.

49:18.555 --> 49:22.122
Getting a real home-cooked meal
like that sure was something else.

49:29.199 --> 49:34.666
Listen, I know how you must be
feeling about Eddie and all.

49:40.343 --> 49:42.977
You always had
the most beautiful heart, Ray.

49:47.717 --> 49:51.353
Well, I've got to get back to my shift,
so I'll talk on you?

49:52.055 --> 49:53.415
Okay.

50:59.856 --> 51:01.853
Where's my mom and dad?

51:13.336 --> 51:14.537
Yeah?

51:14.637 --> 51:15.872
Dirk here?

51:15.972 --> 51:18.375
Saw him around awhile ago.

51:18.475 --> 51:19.835
Dirk?

51:20.643 --> 51:21.969
Dirk!

51:23.580 --> 51:26.850
Oh, I forgot.
He's up at the plant up the street,

51:26.950 --> 51:29.243
but you ain't supposed to go up there.

51:33.790 --> 51:35.759
Adjust that... adjust that choke.

51:35.859 --> 51:37.890
Hand me that wrench.

51:44.167 --> 51:47.671
Boy, all these leaky drums sure look
like an accident waiting to happen.

51:47.771 --> 51:49.873
What are you doing here?
You ain't allowed.

51:49.973 --> 51:52.664
Well, I wanna talk to you about my son.

51:53.476 --> 51:55.945
I'd like it if you didn't drag him
into your line of work.

51:56.045 --> 51:57.547
He ain't even yours, old man.

51:57.647 --> 52:00.016
I'm just saying you
don't need him working for you,

52:00.116 --> 52:01.613
all the guys you got.

52:03.486 --> 52:05.313
Do me this favor, Dirk.

52:07.056 --> 52:09.192
- Favor?
- Yeah, this one time.

52:09.292 --> 52:10.960
I ought to kick your ass right now.

52:11.060 --> 52:12.429
I don't want trouble, Dirk.

52:12.529 --> 52:15.031
I'm just saying it'd be
a nice thing for you to do,

52:15.131 --> 52:17.634
letting him have
a proper shot at a future.

52:17.734 --> 52:19.069
He's a real good kid.

52:19.169 --> 52:21.504
I know. That's why
he's gonna be working for me.

52:21.604 --> 52:23.567
No, but see...

52:25.241 --> 52:28.611
Only thing I see is
a pathetic jerk who's trespassing.

52:28.711 --> 52:31.436
You tell your neighbors
to pay their rent.

52:32.482 --> 52:34.284
Get the fuck off my property.

52:34.384 --> 52:35.915
Bitch.

52:57.574 --> 52:59.409
You pay the rent yet, Den?

52:59.509 --> 53:01.411
Oh, not real... really.

53:01.511 --> 53:02.746
We've been through this.

53:02.846 --> 53:05.378
You're letting everybody down
when you don't.

53:06.516 --> 53:07.717
Ray, I know that.

53:07.817 --> 53:10.854
Denny, you better do something
about the heat, goddamn it.

53:10.954 --> 53:12.781
I'm bustin' a gasket in here.

53:14.958 --> 53:16.989
I don't want him getting into drugs.

53:18.728 --> 53:20.293
I don't care if I'm not...

53:21.731 --> 53:25.001
Then you tell his real father
to take responsibility for once

53:25.101 --> 53:27.030
and give the boy some guidance.

53:27.837 --> 53:29.163
Charlene?

53:54.998 --> 53:57.534
Here's your rent.
It's too hot to stand on ceremony.

53:57.634 --> 53:59.035
So you walk that over to Dirk's

53:59.135 --> 54:01.571
and you tell him to turn
the power back on, okay?

54:01.671 --> 54:03.306
Roger that, Ray.

54:03.406 --> 54:04.808
I'll make good. I swear.

54:04.908 --> 54:07.377
Soon, Den. I can't swing two rents.

54:07.477 --> 54:10.213
Get Selma to quit smoking the ice
and pay your bills.

54:10.313 --> 54:11.347
We clear?

54:11.447 --> 54:13.171
Oh, we're clear as day.

54:15.518 --> 54:18.388
Well, I'm gonna have to put a shirt on.

54:18.488 --> 54:19.916
Then I'll get on it.

54:23.393 --> 54:25.462
Twirling action, like this here.

54:25.562 --> 54:27.197
That's right. You like that?

54:27.297 --> 54:29.699
See? Yeah? Help yourself.
Take everything.

54:29.799 --> 54:31.668
Next time bring your cars.

54:31.768 --> 54:32.836
You got 'em all?

54:32.936 --> 54:35.472
I got as many Huggies as I can carry.

54:35.572 --> 54:37.740
I'm gonna sell this shit on eBay.

54:37.840 --> 54:40.376
The free washer fluid
sure was a nice touch.

54:40.476 --> 54:43.246
Look, Nora, you just
swipe your credit card and go.

54:43.346 --> 54:45.639
Kind of feels
like we're in the big city.

54:46.683 --> 54:47.984
Hey, you guys.

54:48.084 --> 54:49.853
- Hey, Stryker.
- Hi, Nora.

54:49.953 --> 54:51.721
This place is just gorgeous.

54:51.821 --> 54:54.390
Thank you. I'm very, very proud of it.

54:54.490 --> 54:58.228
All I ask is every once in a while
you come on in and fill up a tank.

54:58.328 --> 55:00.029
- Sure.
- Yeah, okay.

55:00.129 --> 55:03.633
And Ray, how's
all that dreaming going, buddy?

55:03.733 --> 55:04.868
A little at a time.

55:04.968 --> 55:07.864
A little at a time,
that's all we can ask for.

55:08.671 --> 55:11.465
- Have fun.
- That man is something else.

55:14.677 --> 55:18.214
You might like to know Eddie's
been doing a real good job for me.

55:18.314 --> 55:19.811
You oughta be proud.

55:20.817 --> 55:22.886
So, are you all of a sudden
the big sugar daddy

55:22.986 --> 55:24.821
for anybody who needs their rent paid?

55:24.921 --> 55:27.323
It's getting awful hot, Dirk.

55:27.423 --> 55:29.826
Some folks are having
a hard time making ends meet.

55:29.926 --> 55:32.028
Maybe you ought
to mind your own business.

55:32.128 --> 55:33.596
It is my business.

55:33.696 --> 55:36.126
Shut off the power, it hurts all of us.

55:37.467 --> 55:40.465
Acting like a tough guy
in front of your new girlfriend here.

55:41.738 --> 55:44.207
Since you're such a rich man,
maybe I oughta raise your rent.

55:44.307 --> 55:46.910
Maybe I should buy a genny
so I don't need your power.

55:47.010 --> 55:48.878
You ain't allowed to do that.

55:48.978 --> 55:50.372
Is that a fact?

55:52.949 --> 55:55.811
I'm gonna lay this out for you
once and for all, old man.

55:56.619 --> 56:00.523
The way things work around here
is everybody does what I tell them to,

56:00.623 --> 56:01.991
and that goes for you double.

56:02.091 --> 56:06.625
Now, you don't like it,
and you're gonna get your ass kicked.

56:07.463 --> 56:09.096
Hey, it's mine!

56:13.536 --> 56:15.238
Better hear what I say, Ray.

56:15.338 --> 56:18.508
Hey, knock it off, all of you,
before I lock you in the dog run again.

56:18.608 --> 56:19.676
Give me that!

56:19.776 --> 56:20.843
Sorry, Dirk.

56:20.943 --> 56:24.237
Fighting over a bottle of antifreeze?
What the fuck is that?

56:25.048 --> 56:26.182
It smells great.

56:26.282 --> 56:28.313
Hope I didn't overcook it.

56:41.597 --> 56:42.889
Okay.

56:45.601 --> 56:47.029
The moment of truth.

56:58.114 --> 56:59.415
Can I make a toast?

56:59.515 --> 57:00.704
Sure.

57:03.319 --> 57:06.289
To the only dinner party
this house has ever known,

57:06.389 --> 57:09.959
and to you, Nora,
for being a part of it.

57:10.059 --> 57:11.761
That was beautiful, Ray.

57:11.861 --> 57:13.050
Thank you.

57:24.307 --> 57:27.101
You sit in the chair there,
and I'll sit on the floor.

57:32.715 --> 57:35.051
Sorry all the proper furniture's gone.

57:35.151 --> 57:36.753
Yeah, it'd be nice

57:36.853 --> 57:39.155
if there was a place
we could be comfortable.

57:39.255 --> 57:40.479
Yeah.

57:56.773 --> 57:59.168
Whoa, nearly 8:45.

58:00.777 --> 58:02.645
Both got to work tomorrow
and everything.

58:02.745 --> 58:05.505
Actually, tomorrow's my day off.

58:06.816 --> 58:08.176
Is that a fact?

58:13.022 --> 58:14.621
Seem warm in here?

58:16.492 --> 58:18.216
I think it's fine, Ray.

58:19.028 --> 58:20.456
It's fine.

58:23.666 --> 58:24.958
What's that light?

58:26.068 --> 58:27.530
There, out front.

58:40.049 --> 58:41.546
Oh, Ray.

58:44.420 --> 58:47.054
Things are gonna have
to change around here, Nora.

58:48.191 --> 58:49.659
And he wasn't kidding.

58:49.759 --> 58:51.060
Everyone was gettin' fed up

58:51.160 --> 58:53.463
with the whole deal in this town,
including me.

58:53.563 --> 58:55.164
Where am I dropping you, Ray?

58:55.264 --> 58:56.829
Got to get in to work.

58:57.733 --> 59:00.903
Insurance guy said he'd drop
the check by end of the day.

59:01.003 --> 59:03.865
What kind of car you think
600 bucks buys these days?

59:04.674 --> 59:06.398
More than my Gremlin.

59:08.945 --> 59:10.942
Elmo, pull over a sec.

59:30.633 --> 59:33.028
- Merl?
- Damn.

59:39.008 --> 59:41.836
Son of a bitch.
Elmo, give me a hand here.

59:46.082 --> 59:47.250
Be right there.

59:47.350 --> 59:50.713
I'll get you. Today would be nice.

59:52.021 --> 59:54.023
That punk Dirk.

59:54.123 --> 59:55.458
I got him good, though.

59:55.558 --> 59:57.493
I think I might've broken his nose.

59:57.593 --> 59:59.818
His... jerks...

01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:03.366
they just held me down,
beat the shit out of me.

01:00:03.466 --> 01:00:05.401
We gotta get you to a hospital, Merl.

01:00:05.501 --> 01:00:08.135
No, just take me home.
My missus will clean me up.

01:00:24.921 --> 01:00:26.556
Quite a place you got here, Merl.

01:00:26.656 --> 01:00:28.016
Thank you, Ray.

01:00:29.158 --> 01:00:30.459
- Oh, honey.
- Oh, my word.

01:00:30.559 --> 01:00:31.994
There she is, my darling.

01:00:32.094 --> 01:00:35.131
What happened to you?
I have been worried sick.

01:00:35.231 --> 01:00:38.000
Bunch of thugs beat up
on your pop at the gas station.

01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:39.602
Her pop?

01:00:39.702 --> 01:00:41.103
This is my old lady, son.

01:00:41.203 --> 01:00:44.006
I told you about having big dreams, Ray.

01:00:44.106 --> 01:00:46.175
- Come on.
- Okay. Oh...

01:00:46.275 --> 01:00:48.067
Honey, I need a hot bath.

01:00:50.046 --> 01:00:53.716
Oh, yeah, honey, come on.
Gonna take care of Daddy?

01:00:53.816 --> 01:00:55.074
My goodness.

01:00:55.885 --> 01:00:57.074
Damn.

01:01:09.231 --> 01:01:11.067
Evening, gentlemen.

01:01:11.167 --> 01:01:12.468
Hi, Nora.

01:01:12.568 --> 01:01:15.037
Hey. That the new car?

01:01:15.137 --> 01:01:18.641
Barely runs.
It'll be fine once we get done with it.

01:01:18.741 --> 01:01:21.177
Sorry to barge in on you,
but I could use some help.

01:01:21.277 --> 01:01:23.279
Sure. That's nice. Where'd you get that?

01:01:23.379 --> 01:01:25.915
Thrift store in Ridgecrest.
You want to help me get it inside?

01:01:26.015 --> 01:01:27.083
Let me go lock up.

01:01:27.183 --> 01:01:30.318
No. It's for you, Ray.

01:01:31.854 --> 01:01:33.316
You got this for me?

01:01:34.724 --> 01:01:36.292
How come?

01:01:36.392 --> 01:01:39.662
Just thought it'd be nice for you
to have a place to get comfortable

01:01:39.762 --> 01:01:44.133
so you can have company,
to chat and things.

01:01:44.233 --> 01:01:45.593
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:01:47.970 --> 01:01:49.572
Think you could give us a hand, Den?

01:01:49.672 --> 01:01:51.897
Got a couple of long necks
with your name on 'em.

01:01:52.708 --> 01:01:54.076
You got yourself a deal.

01:01:54.176 --> 01:01:55.900
Heavy little thing.

01:01:58.114 --> 01:02:00.549
Dang if that don't look just great.

01:02:00.649 --> 01:02:03.044
Man, that was quite a workout.

01:02:04.186 --> 01:02:05.488
I sure am thirsty.

01:02:05.588 --> 01:02:08.120
Oh, right. Got you covered.

01:02:10.993 --> 01:02:12.353
Damn.

01:02:13.229 --> 01:02:15.897
This place is
a hell of a lot nicer than my hole.

01:02:19.268 --> 01:02:20.770
You know, I was thinking

01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:24.972
maybe me and you could
get together sometime...

01:02:26.308 --> 01:02:27.998
reminisce.

01:02:28.911 --> 01:02:30.408
About what?

01:02:31.247 --> 01:02:32.415
Here you go, Den.

01:02:32.515 --> 01:02:34.216
Oh, bitchin'.

01:02:34.316 --> 01:02:35.778
See you guys later.

01:02:38.287 --> 01:02:39.689
He's a character, that boy.

01:02:39.789 --> 01:02:41.490
He's harmless enough.

01:02:41.590 --> 01:02:43.359
His wife's another kettle of fish.

01:02:43.459 --> 01:02:45.461
- Was she in our class?
- Not for very long.

01:02:45.561 --> 01:02:49.162
Think she got thrown out for beating up
the vice principal or something.

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:52.597
Take it for a test drive.

01:03:00.443 --> 01:03:01.677
Well, what do you think?

01:03:01.777 --> 01:03:02.845
Feels good.

01:03:02.945 --> 01:03:04.806
Mmm, yeah.

01:03:08.984 --> 01:03:10.879
You're awful sweet, aren't you?

01:03:11.687 --> 01:03:13.456
Well, you tell me.

01:03:13.556 --> 01:03:15.280
Well, I think you are, yeah.

01:03:16.559 --> 01:03:18.021
Real sweet.

01:03:24.366 --> 01:03:26.727
Well, I didn't mean
to barge in like this...

01:03:27.903 --> 01:03:30.506
so you just enjoy this here sofa,

01:03:30.606 --> 01:03:34.010
and maybe sometime
we'll get to share it together again.

01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:37.336
I don't think I'll let anyone else
sit on it except for you and me.

01:03:38.314 --> 01:03:40.072
What's so funny? I'm serious.

01:03:41.951 --> 01:03:43.786
Now, why are you looking
at me like that?

01:03:43.886 --> 01:03:46.489
- Like what?
- Just like that.

01:03:46.589 --> 01:03:49.553
Like I got something in my teeth.

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:53.295
Is that really
how I'm looking at you, Ray?

01:03:53.395 --> 01:03:56.393
Well, not exactly, I guess...

01:03:57.666 --> 01:04:00.102
but you sure look at me different
than any woman ever has.

01:04:00.202 --> 01:04:01.904
Oh, now...

01:04:02.004 --> 01:04:03.398
What's that about?

01:04:04.673 --> 01:04:06.108
Well, maybe I'm just enjoying

01:04:06.208 --> 01:04:09.468
being able to sit with you face to face
after all these years.

01:04:10.379 --> 01:04:12.715
How, until recently,
I hadn't got to spend

01:04:12.815 --> 01:04:16.719
more than five or ten minutes
at a time with you since 11th grade,

01:04:16.819 --> 01:04:18.816
but how that was enough for me.

01:04:25.494 --> 01:04:28.130
Well, as you like say,
you got to get up early, so...

01:04:28.230 --> 01:04:29.795
I ain't saying it now.

01:04:30.633 --> 01:04:33.165
Yeah, well, maybe I am.

01:04:39.175 --> 01:04:41.275
Hey, Nora, let's get loaded.

01:04:58.994 --> 01:05:01.897
...in front of my house.
Eddie, come with me.

01:05:01.997 --> 01:05:04.033
Get the fuck away from my bike, man.

01:05:04.133 --> 01:05:05.101
Seriously.

01:05:05.201 --> 01:05:06.993
All right. Let's go.

01:05:59.088 --> 01:06:00.812
Hurry up. Hurry up, man.

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:12.789
Take it.

01:07:05.521 --> 01:07:08.019
Spoonie, you keep a lookout.
Eddie, come with me.

01:07:12.961 --> 01:07:16.398
Goddamn it, what did I tell you
about doing that in front of me!

01:07:16.498 --> 01:07:17.600
What are you, six?

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:18.801
Sorry, Dirk.

01:07:18.901 --> 01:07:20.261
It's fucking gross.

01:07:23.172 --> 01:07:25.340
Which one of you inbreds
left the door unlocked?

01:07:26.642 --> 01:07:28.002
Where's the lock?

01:07:29.111 --> 01:07:31.472
- For what?
- For the door, you idiot.

01:07:33.082 --> 01:07:35.918
- I ain't no idiot.
- You're such a fucking idiot!

01:07:36.018 --> 01:07:37.119
You're an idiot.

01:07:37.219 --> 01:07:39.011
- What?
- What?

01:07:59.341 --> 01:08:03.912
Denny, hey, dumbass!
The power's off again.

01:08:04.012 --> 01:08:06.840
- Denny!
- All right, woman, I hear you.

01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:10.986
Hey, Ray? Power's off again.

01:08:11.086 --> 01:08:12.254
So's the water.

01:08:12.354 --> 01:08:13.889
Ray, I'm current on the rent.

01:08:13.989 --> 01:08:16.885
I swear everybody
in the neighborhood's all paid, too.

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:19.595
Did you take out the goddamn batteries?

01:08:19.694 --> 01:08:21.529
I think it's a plug-in.

01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:23.194
Plug it in to fucking what?

01:08:25.267 --> 01:08:29.238
Hello. I'm sweating
my balls off out here.

01:08:29.337 --> 01:08:32.675
Yeah, I was right in the middle
of my weekly shower.

01:08:32.774 --> 01:08:35.877
Well, there's nothing
we can do about it tonight, so...

01:08:35.978 --> 01:08:38.247
How abouts we just don't
pay our rents no more?

01:08:38.346 --> 01:08:41.050
- He'll have to do what we says.
- Want to risk being thrown out?

01:08:41.149 --> 01:08:44.183
- Where you gonna move, Den?
- In with you.

01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:47.183
Then what are we supposed to do?

01:08:49.291 --> 01:08:51.026
You all just cope a little while,

01:08:51.126 --> 01:08:53.260
and we'll get squared soon, I promise.

01:09:08.743 --> 01:09:10.171
Fucking...

01:09:11.345 --> 01:09:12.569
Bitch!

01:09:14.683 --> 01:09:16.251
Go to town and get the Huggies.

01:09:16.350 --> 01:09:17.720
Bitch, what do you think I'm doing?

01:09:17.819 --> 01:09:20.288
- I'm a responsible-ass father.
- I asked you five hours ago.

01:09:20.389 --> 01:09:22.224
I know what the hell
I'm supposed to be doing.

01:09:22.323 --> 01:09:23.524
Get the Huggies!

01:09:23.625 --> 01:09:26.055
Just mind your own babies, goddamn it.

01:09:54.089 --> 01:09:55.057
What?

01:09:55.157 --> 01:09:57.325
You wanna work off
the rent money you owe me?

01:09:58.594 --> 01:09:59.862
Like a... a job?

01:09:59.962 --> 01:10:03.932
Take this list, go in to Ridgecrest
to a Supply Sergeant.

01:10:04.032 --> 01:10:06.335
Well, Ray, I'm sort of busy today.

01:10:06.435 --> 01:10:08.337
Too bad. Do it.

01:10:08.437 --> 01:10:10.366
Be at my house, 11:00.

01:10:11.273 --> 01:10:13.304
And tell Selma to bring her A game.

01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:21.481
Scotty. Scotty.

01:10:23.285 --> 01:10:25.419
Got a little assignment for you.

01:10:28.624 --> 01:10:31.452
Don't you think "Happy Days"
is just the best?

01:10:32.394 --> 01:10:34.663
It is awfully good.

01:10:34.763 --> 01:10:36.555
There's no denying it.

01:10:39.535 --> 01:10:42.602
We really do have quite a lot
in common, don't you think?

01:10:43.572 --> 01:10:45.034
I do, Ray.

01:10:53.248 --> 01:10:55.507
Special Ops to the rescue.

01:10:58.854 --> 01:11:03.923
Now, Ray, this may be a little short,
but I let out the crotch.

01:11:09.231 --> 01:11:11.400
Den, there's just no way.

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:13.190
- No?
- No.

01:11:14.002 --> 01:11:15.533
Just a thought.

01:11:20.609 --> 01:11:22.936
Well, it's not
a Junior Miss pageant, Ray.

01:11:23.745 --> 01:11:25.003
Door's open.

01:11:26.882 --> 01:11:28.417
Hey, kids.

01:11:28.517 --> 01:11:29.751
Thanks for showing, Merl.

01:11:29.851 --> 01:11:31.420
I wouldn't miss this for the world.

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:34.590
I can't wait to chew that jerk
a new set of butt cheeks.

01:11:34.690 --> 01:11:36.992
Howdy, folks. Am I late?

01:11:37.092 --> 01:11:39.595
- Right on time.
- Well, how cool is that?

01:11:39.695 --> 01:11:42.523
I don't think I've been on time
my whole life.

01:11:45.867 --> 01:11:48.170
Who invited the Chippendales reject?

01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:50.233
Scotty, you forget to change?

01:11:51.373 --> 01:11:54.269
Never mind. Running behind schedule.

01:11:56.612 --> 01:11:58.013
Hey, everybody.

01:11:58.113 --> 01:12:01.077
Heard you folks need
a little ass kicked.

01:12:01.883 --> 01:12:05.883
Coming up on 2300 hours.
Everyone clear on their mission?

01:12:06.722 --> 01:12:08.290
- You bet.
- Yeah.

01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:11.159
All right, then.
Let's light this candle.

01:12:11.259 --> 01:12:12.289
Right.

01:12:13.128 --> 01:12:14.386
Okay, let's go.

01:12:15.998 --> 01:12:18.200
What has gotten into you, Ray Tuckby?

01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:21.094
Life, Nora. Life's gotten into me.

01:12:28.343 --> 01:12:30.746
I mean, can you just imagine
these dinosaurs thundering

01:12:30.846 --> 01:12:33.916
over the Earth in the Jurassic age?

01:12:34.016 --> 01:12:35.376
Here we go.

01:12:37.719 --> 01:12:40.114
Let's go over here. Get down.

01:12:42.157 --> 01:12:44.222
Twenty bucks says it won't go off.

01:12:45.627 --> 01:12:48.853
Make it 30, and it's a deal.

01:12:54.302 --> 01:12:56.163
I'll have to owe you the extra ten.

01:12:59.508 --> 01:13:01.835
Okay, I guess.

01:13:06.048 --> 01:13:07.049
What the heck?

01:13:07.149 --> 01:13:10.182
Didn't Dirk say nobody
was allowed up here?

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:19.428
Excuse me.

01:13:19.528 --> 01:13:22.629
I'm lost, and I cannot find my way.

01:13:23.498 --> 01:13:25.233
Where you trying to get to?

01:13:25.333 --> 01:13:26.898
Bakersfield.

01:13:28.303 --> 01:13:31.940
Highway is just down yonder.

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:34.265
How can I ever repay you?

01:13:56.131 --> 01:13:57.855
Hey, what are you doing here?

01:14:03.105 --> 01:14:04.670
Coming!

01:14:05.474 --> 01:14:06.663
Yeah?

01:14:08.944 --> 01:14:11.442
Hey there! Excuse me.

01:14:13.248 --> 01:14:15.780
What the hell you doing?
Get out of my house!

01:14:26.962 --> 01:14:29.096
Never did appreciate that breed.

01:14:44.713 --> 01:14:47.381
That's quite a talent
your wife's got there.

01:14:48.717 --> 01:14:50.782
She do parties as well?

01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:53.555
Knock it off, you perv.

01:14:53.655 --> 01:14:55.657
- Is he dead?
- Candy, get out here!

01:14:55.757 --> 01:14:56.992
There's a dead guy.

01:14:57.092 --> 01:14:58.960
Shut up! You'll wake the baby.

01:14:59.060 --> 01:15:01.125
Boy, am I glad Denny shoots blanks.

01:15:02.330 --> 01:15:03.298
Okay, let's go.

01:15:03.398 --> 01:15:05.767
I'll hand him up to you.
You start loading the truck.

01:15:05.867 --> 01:15:08.934
Just so you know,
babies give me the heebie-jeebies.

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:14.435
Good job, Den. Come on.

01:15:17.579 --> 01:15:18.939
Come on.

01:15:30.926 --> 01:15:32.991
Remember, Selma, be gentle.

01:15:33.829 --> 01:15:35.155
Go on.

01:15:37.933 --> 01:15:39.566
Yuck.

01:15:42.938 --> 01:15:44.506
So what's it gonna be, tough guy?

01:15:44.606 --> 01:15:46.603
Join the resistance or get vaporized?

01:15:52.581 --> 01:15:54.850
That's our cue. Come on.

01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:56.351
Just another minute.

01:15:56.451 --> 01:15:57.753
Well, here goes.

01:15:57.853 --> 01:16:00.613
Gonna make ourselves
a whole new future, gentlemen.

01:16:02.290 --> 01:16:03.325
What's wrong?

01:16:03.425 --> 01:16:07.117
I was just kinda hoping
I could push the button, Mr. Tuckby.

01:16:07.929 --> 01:16:09.865
I really like blowin' shit up.

01:16:09.965 --> 01:16:12.901
All right, but
no funny business, you hear?

01:16:13.001 --> 01:16:14.532
Tits!

01:16:18.573 --> 01:16:20.638
Get the truck and take him to the dump.

01:16:21.309 --> 01:16:22.477
For real, Dirk?

01:16:22.577 --> 01:16:24.246
Deal with it, goddamn it!

01:16:24.346 --> 01:16:27.413
This is for calling me an idiot
every day of my life, Dirk.

01:16:35.090 --> 01:16:37.092
Go get a potato sack and some twine.

01:16:37.192 --> 01:16:38.950
I'll go get the truck.

01:16:43.298 --> 01:16:44.692
What the... hey!

01:16:46.801 --> 01:16:49.805
That's for giving me heat rash, mo-fo.

01:16:49.905 --> 01:16:51.072
It can go boy, it can go girl.

01:16:51.172 --> 01:16:53.408
Scotty, you do whatever
the hell you want with him.

01:16:53.508 --> 01:16:56.233
It's not just for a girly girl or a boy.

01:16:57.078 --> 01:16:58.245
Do it again.

01:17:11.793 --> 01:17:13.461
Oh, my Lord.

01:17:13.561 --> 01:17:15.729
I think I fudged my pants.

01:17:22.804 --> 01:17:24.039
Oh, those babies.

01:17:24.139 --> 01:17:26.773
I just want to eat them up,
they're so precious.

01:17:33.381 --> 01:17:35.105
There it is.

01:17:38.653 --> 01:17:40.582
Shit, man, that was fun.

01:17:43.325 --> 01:17:45.117
My God, we've done good, Ray.

01:17:46.361 --> 01:17:49.564
Just like that game we won
against Solvang back in '89

01:17:49.664 --> 01:17:53.823
when I made that key block
and basically walked into the end zone.

01:17:55.170 --> 01:17:57.072
You remember, right, Ray?

01:17:57.172 --> 01:17:58.532
My key block?

01:17:59.441 --> 01:18:03.245
Turned out the little twerp
wasn't that hard to take down.

01:18:03.345 --> 01:18:06.448
Just a bit of guts
and determination from all of us,

01:18:06.548 --> 01:18:11.776
Dirk and company went over faster
than a one-legged cat in a sand box.

01:18:16.558 --> 01:18:18.350
Let us down!

01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:26.401
Good job, guys.

01:18:26.501 --> 01:18:28.168
Pleasure's right here, Ray.

01:18:30.271 --> 01:18:32.939
Get this thing off of me. Somebody help!

01:18:33.842 --> 01:18:35.976
That hurts, goddamn it.

01:18:38.113 --> 01:18:39.814
Let's get the record straight, punk.

01:18:39.914 --> 01:18:41.549
You're going to apologize right now

01:18:41.649 --> 01:18:44.753
for making life a dark, ugly experience
in this here community,

01:18:44.853 --> 01:18:46.888
or Scotty's going to teach you
what true pain is.

01:18:46.988 --> 01:18:48.423
We clear?

01:18:48.523 --> 01:18:49.781
Eat me.

01:18:50.892 --> 01:18:52.560
Got another surprise for you.

01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:53.690
Merl?

01:18:55.830 --> 01:18:58.533
Sasquatch Two, this is Sasquatch One.

01:18:58.633 --> 01:19:00.735
We're ready for Operation Clean Sweep.

01:19:00.835 --> 01:19:02.170
Roger that, Sasquatch One.

01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:05.740
You and your cohorts
are going to take a nice long time out.

01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:06.808
Gentlemen.

01:19:06.908 --> 01:19:08.910
No fucking way. I didn't do nothing.

01:19:09.010 --> 01:19:10.871
Well, we don't see it that way.

01:19:13.348 --> 01:19:15.016
Take care now.

01:19:15.116 --> 01:19:16.340
Somebody help me.

01:19:17.819 --> 01:19:21.156
Candy, Tammy, Wanda, Jeanine?

01:19:21.256 --> 01:19:25.060
I made this town.
I made this town what it is.

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:27.195
You all have roofs over your head
because of me,

01:19:27.295 --> 01:19:29.064
all of your ugly-ass heads.

01:19:29.164 --> 01:19:31.733
Oh, no. He's gonna be crying.

01:19:31.833 --> 01:19:34.736
He's going to prison,
gonna learn his lesson.

01:19:34.836 --> 01:19:37.739
He's off. Oh, hey.

01:19:37.839 --> 01:19:39.574
Hey, hold on, hold on.

01:19:39.674 --> 01:19:42.001
Can I just say a few more things?

01:19:43.044 --> 01:19:45.513
What if I, like, turn over
a whole new loaf,

01:19:45.613 --> 01:19:47.415
or whatever that is, and I'll change?

01:19:47.515 --> 01:19:48.516
Sorry, Spoon.

01:19:48.616 --> 01:19:51.486
You go clean up and come back,
and we'll make nice, deal?

01:19:51.586 --> 01:19:54.311
All right, deal.
Wait, you're pinching my wrist.

01:20:13.374 --> 01:20:16.444
Ray, you know, my wife is
in need of a little rehab herself.

01:20:16.544 --> 01:20:18.880
I was thinking maybe
we could put her on a bus.

01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:21.375
You're gonna have
to deal with that on your own.

01:20:23.084 --> 01:20:25.548
God, I hate to piss that woman off.

01:20:30.325 --> 01:20:32.083
Right on schedule.

01:20:34.395 --> 01:20:36.331
Those girls over there.

01:20:36.431 --> 01:20:37.732
Well, Ray...

01:20:37.832 --> 01:20:39.522
I'll see you around.

01:20:55.917 --> 01:20:57.948
Well, what now, Ray?

01:20:59.187 --> 01:21:01.184
I guess that's up to us.

01:21:07.495 --> 01:21:09.097
You know how they say

01:21:09.197 --> 01:21:13.128
"The more things change,
the more they stay the same"?

01:21:16.437 --> 01:21:17.865
Well...

01:21:44.132 --> 01:21:46.596
Can you believe this?

01:22:03.318 --> 01:22:05.452
Sounds nice.

01:22:09.991 --> 01:22:11.351
Nora...

01:22:14.195 --> 01:22:16.798
Remember awhile back,
you asked me why I never left Trona?

01:22:16.898 --> 01:22:19.334
Yes, I do.

01:22:19.434 --> 01:22:23.536
Well, it was 'cause of you.

01:22:24.472 --> 01:22:27.008
This place is hell, Nora,

01:22:27.108 --> 01:22:29.978
but knowing I'd get to come through
that Rite-Valu door every day

01:22:30.078 --> 01:22:32.678
and see your sweet face
made it paradise.

01:22:33.748 --> 01:22:35.142
Ditto.

01:22:45.126 --> 01:22:46.850
What the hey was that?

01:22:48.529 --> 01:22:50.265
It's called a French kiss.

01:22:50.365 --> 01:22:51.759
A what?

01:22:52.567 --> 01:22:55.537
It's a little more intimate
than a regular kiss.

01:22:55.637 --> 01:22:59.207
I read about it recently
in one of those Harlequin books

01:22:59.307 --> 01:23:01.843
over in the miscellaneous section,
aisle three.

01:23:01.943 --> 01:23:03.838
It sure was different.

01:23:04.646 --> 01:23:06.245
Kind of like a toothbrush...

01:23:07.048 --> 01:23:08.272
but I liked it.

01:23:09.083 --> 01:23:11.052
You can try it if you want to.

01:23:11.152 --> 01:23:12.478
Okay.

01:23:13.921 --> 01:23:14.923
You sure?

01:23:15.023 --> 01:23:17.657
Whatever you're comfortable with.

01:23:26.634 --> 01:23:28.392
I think I'm getting the hang of it.

01:24:09.877 --> 01:24:12.046
There are two types of heroes.

01:24:12.146 --> 01:24:14.282
One changes himself,

01:24:14.382 --> 01:24:17.118
the other changes those around him.

01:24:17.218 --> 01:24:19.153
Is that some of your
famous lemon meringue?

01:24:19.253 --> 01:24:21.256
Recipe's been in my family
for generations.

01:24:21.356 --> 01:24:22.357
Bring on a slice or two.

01:24:22.457 --> 01:24:23.591
Coming right up. Den?

01:24:23.691 --> 01:24:27.228
Well, I guess in the end, Ray was both.

01:24:27.328 --> 01:24:28.463
I'll help you, darling.

01:24:28.563 --> 01:24:30.526
Right this way, folks.

01:24:33.835 --> 01:24:36.299
R'ch'lle, you're doing a great job.

01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:40.908
How's the back holding up, hon?

01:24:41.008 --> 01:24:42.698
Just fine, Ray.

01:24:44.045 --> 01:24:47.415
Eddie, I think we're gonna need
to add another pastry chef.

01:24:47.515 --> 01:24:49.182
I'm already on it, Pop.

01:24:51.152 --> 01:24:55.186
Hey, where can a man and his missus
get something to eat around here?

01:24:56.057 --> 01:24:58.359
- How have you been, friend?
- Ray, how you doin'?

01:24:58.459 --> 01:25:00.461
It looks like we're on
the same schedule.

01:25:00.561 --> 01:25:02.363
- Nora, you look really nice.
- Hi.

01:25:02.463 --> 01:25:03.798
- You know Angel?
- Yes. Hi.

01:25:03.898 --> 01:25:05.633
Well, we were just driving around,

01:25:05.733 --> 01:25:07.535
and we thought maybe we'd come to see

01:25:07.635 --> 01:25:09.737
what kind of progress you were making.

01:25:09.837 --> 01:25:13.775
I wanna tell you, Ray, you got it all.

01:25:13.875 --> 01:25:15.443
I am so proud of you.

01:25:15.543 --> 01:25:17.912
Well, couldn't have done it without you.

01:25:18.012 --> 01:25:19.873
I know that.

01:25:21.315 --> 01:25:23.818
How about a table
for a couple hungry people?

01:25:23.918 --> 01:25:25.553
Oh, by the way,

01:25:25.653 --> 01:25:28.549
I heard that meringue is to die for.

01:25:31.325 --> 01:25:32.549
Right this way.

01:25:33.661 --> 01:25:38.266
Maybe the American dream
does still exist,

01:25:38.366 --> 01:25:40.767
even for my friend Ray...

01:25:40.768 --> 01:25:44.631
and even in a place like Trona.
