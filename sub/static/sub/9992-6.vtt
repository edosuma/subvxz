WEBVTT

00:00.642 --> 00:02.017
Mommy!

00:04.213 --> 00:05.425
Mommy!

00:10.302 --> 00:11.504
Mommy!

00:17.505 --> 00:20.105
- Mommy!
- Ariel?

00:23.033 --> 00:24.551
Ariel, where are you?

00:26.173 --> 00:28.851
Ariel, talk to Mommy.

00:28.923 --> 00:31.359
- Mommy!
- Where are you?

00:32.804 --> 00:33.920
Ariel?!

00:38.057 --> 00:38.948
Joe?

00:39.695 --> 00:42.624
Allison, Joe's not here.

00:44.882 --> 00:45.871
Who are you?

00:46.810 --> 00:47.864
Where's Ariel?

00:50.473 --> 00:51.489
You know me.

00:53.855 --> 00:54.841
I'm the golem.

00:57.211 --> 00:58.332
I'm the devil.

01:00.098 --> 01:01.189
I'm a monster.

01:03.751 --> 01:04.952
And your little girl?

01:06.324 --> 01:07.947
She's in the trunk of my car.

01:08.972 --> 01:11.496
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've come back to get the other ones...

01:11.645 --> 01:13.478
No! No!

01:21.107 --> 01:22.631
I need you awake.

01:22.918 --> 01:25.965
I can do awake. Just give me a couple of hours.

01:26.400 --> 01:29.232
- Joe.
- Okay, okay, I'm awake.

01:30.235 --> 01:33.169
I'm awake, mostly. What's going on, bad dream?

01:33.267 --> 01:35.391
Yeah. No.

01:36.318 --> 01:37.563
Did you hear that?

01:38.002 --> 01:40.244
- Mommy!
- It's Ariel!

01:42.575 --> 01:43.844
I'll check on Marie.

01:45.958 --> 01:48.175
- She's okay.
- Mommy!

01:53.992 --> 01:55.451
Mommy!

01:56.724 --> 02:00.239
Tell me, darling, was there a doll in this dream?

02:01.114 --> 02:03.106
Other than you, you mean?

02:04.242 --> 02:08.411
Okay. And Saturday Ariel has a soccer game, so...

02:08.741 --> 02:10.186
we have to pick up snacks.

02:10.902 --> 02:11.912
Again?

02:13.704 --> 02:17.995
Okay, fine, just... this time let's bring something good.

02:18.062 --> 02:21.000
No fruit, you know? I felt like an idiot last time.

02:21.082 --> 02:24.048
If you want to feed growing girls grease and sugar,

02:24.108 --> 02:26.330
then you could stop by the market and pick it up yourself.

02:26.403 --> 02:26.986
Fine.

02:30.556 --> 02:32.192
Isn't this always the case?

02:32.684 --> 02:36.002
I'm finally tired enough to go back to sleep, and the sun's coming up.

02:36.602 --> 02:37.851
Wait a second.

02:38.111 --> 02:39.269
Just wait a second.

02:39.397 --> 02:40.539
What's the matter, you miss something?

02:41.184 --> 02:42.434
You could say that.

02:42.756 --> 02:44.097
I'm a week late.

02:44.226 --> 02:45.321
Late for what?

02:47.555 --> 02:49.207
Oh, you're that kind of late?

02:50.615 --> 02:51.640
Late late?

02:52.194 --> 02:54.179
Yeah, Joe, a week late.

02:54.352 --> 02:55.413
Late late.

02:56.897 --> 02:59.815
Well. Guess I'm awake now.

03:01.000 --> 03:07.074

03:45.771 --> 03:49.778
You know what, when you stop and think about it, I think it's kind of neat.

03:50.023 --> 03:52.122
Or at least it could be, if it actually happened.

03:52.235 --> 03:53.593
If what actually happened?

03:53.709 --> 03:55.978
- Nothing.
- Nothing. Neat?

03:56.213 --> 03:59.911
Yeah. We've been to this barbecue a couple times before-- we know what to expect.

04:00.612 --> 04:02.961
It's not like you're in it alone. I'll help.

04:03.136 --> 04:06.182
Oh. You'll help-- oh, that's great.

04:06.280 --> 04:07.154
I'll tell you what.

04:07.313 --> 04:09.305
I'll gain the 60 pounds this time,

04:09.361 --> 04:11.640
but you can have the hemorrhoids and the swollen ankles,

04:11.696 --> 04:13.760
'cause that  would be really helpful-- that would be neat.

04:13.827 --> 04:16.196
- What are you guys talking about?
- Nothing.

04:16.591 --> 04:19.108
And while you're at it, maybe you could take three months off from work

04:19.166 --> 04:21.087
- so you could stay home and breast-feed.
- Very funny.

04:21.194 --> 04:22.685
- Mommy!
- What?

04:23.523 --> 04:25.064
Mommy said "breast."

04:25.342 --> 04:26.913
All right, I'm sorry I said anything.

04:27.169 --> 04:28.024
Me, too.

04:29.775 --> 04:32.714
So where does all this giddy good cheer come from?

04:33.047 --> 04:36.477
You suddenly like your cars filled with sticky car seats?

04:36.683 --> 04:40.240
You've grown accustomed to waking up early on Sunday mornings and not having sex?

04:41.033 --> 04:45.601
You're hooked on the smell of ripe diapers and you're worried it's gonna end sometime soon?

04:47.942 --> 04:50.148
- Talk to me.
- I don't have anything to say.

04:50.445 --> 04:52.785
I was feeling good about the possibility, but you've made me see

04:52.846 --> 04:54.909
the error of my ways and I've changed my mind.

04:55.119 --> 04:58.970
Liar. You think I'm mean and selfish and unromantic and...

04:59.047 --> 05:00.434
Why do you ask me questions?

05:01.181 --> 05:02.682
If you think you know what I'm thinking,

05:02.758 --> 05:04.488
why put me through the trouble of answering?

05:05.616 --> 05:09.829
Look, I want to have a little boy, too. Maybe not right this second, but...

05:09.911 --> 05:11.094
Is that what you think this is about?

05:13.910 --> 05:15.512
Did you finish your math homework?

05:16.389 --> 05:17.668
Most of it.

05:18.094 --> 05:19.858
Most of it is not all of it.

05:19.947 --> 05:23.224
You know you're not gonna get better if you don't work on the problems you can't solve.

05:23.761 --> 05:27.028
-  I know, I know.
- Ariel didn't finish her math homework.

05:27.325 --> 05:28.287
Ariel...

05:28.583 --> 05:29.598
Don't be mad.

05:29.782 --> 05:31.247
I just don't like it.

05:31.503 --> 05:34.492
Don't like math? But math is the best!

05:36.007 --> 05:38.958
Daddy should know-- math is how he makes his living.

05:39.131 --> 05:41.352
I thought you were an aerospace engineer.

05:41.451 --> 05:42.449
Oh, boy.

05:42.914 --> 05:45.434
What is it you think an aerospace engineer does, honey?

05:46.089 --> 05:47.087
I don't know.

05:48.736 --> 05:49.322
What?

05:49.414 --> 05:52.383
Okay, you and me, tonight, by the kitchen table.

05:52.511 --> 05:53.606
What are you talking about?

05:53.738 --> 05:55.163
Dad's gonna tutor you in math.

05:55.653 --> 05:59.821
- Oh, no, no, please, no. No! No!
- Yes, oh, yes. Everybody in the car.

05:59.929 --> 06:02.361
Oh, please, no? Oh, great.

06:02.667 --> 06:05.234
About earlier-- I am excited.

06:05.553 --> 06:06.887
I'll get excited.

06:07.450 --> 06:09.914
And I will stay home and breast-feed. You'll see.

06:10.763 --> 06:12.427
You know, before anyone gets too excited,

06:12.498 --> 06:14.858
we should make sure it's really, you know, happening.

06:15.412 --> 06:17.664
What, you're not gonna pee on a stick for me, too?

06:20.517 --> 06:22.980
I'll pick up a pregnancy test at lunch!

06:23.066 --> 06:25.095
Bring it home. I'm good at tests.

06:26.881 --> 06:29.818
- You made my job very easy.
- Well, that's nice of you to say.

06:32.292 --> 06:35.493
- Thank you again for all your help, Mr. Swanstrom.
- My pleasure. I'm just glad I could help.

06:35.569 --> 06:37.126
- Hey, Allison.
- Hey.

06:40.607 --> 06:41.345
Going down?

06:41.933 --> 06:43.250
No. Thank you.

06:44.273 --> 06:46.372
- Okay. See you. 
- Bye.

06:48.252 --> 06:49.276
Nice fella.

06:49.373 --> 06:51.222
Excuse me, but who was that man?

06:51.293 --> 06:51.928
What  man?

06:52.015 --> 06:53.767
That man, that man in the elevator.

06:54.212 --> 06:56.142
Oh. That man.

06:56.228 --> 06:59.194
Allison, that man was a true human oddity,

06:59.246 --> 07:01.389
the kind of man you don't meet every day in this city.

07:01.467 --> 07:06.443
A throwback to another time, when Phoenicians actually cared for the well-being of others.

07:06.511 --> 07:09.925
Allison, that man was an honest-to-God Good Samaritan.

07:09.996 --> 07:11.552
And does this good Samaritan have a name?

07:11.641 --> 07:13.243
Yeah. Jared Swanstrom.

07:13.335 --> 07:16.022
And what makes Mr. Swanstrom such a Good Samaritan?

07:17.196 --> 07:20.225
Last night, that young man happened to look out his apartment window

07:20.283 --> 07:23.002
and notice that the apartment across the way was being burglarized.

07:23.073 --> 07:26.074
He phoned the police, gave them a complete description of the burglar,

07:26.145 --> 07:29.225
and this morning he positively identified the man in a lineup.

07:29.289 --> 07:32.821
This afternoon he's coming back to give us his official statement, and...

07:33.003 --> 07:35.915
in the event of a trial, he's already agreed to testify.

07:35.985 --> 07:37.727
- So he's a witness?
- Yes.

07:37.809 --> 07:39.277
Why, did you think he was a criminal?

07:41.122 --> 07:42.529
Why would I think that?

07:45.048 --> 07:46.128
A hundred and eight.

07:48.944 --> 07:49.923
Eighty-one.

07:50.206 --> 07:52.177
Look at it this way-- you were half right.

07:52.759 --> 07:55.242
You dreamt about the guy, and there he was the next day.

07:55.342 --> 07:56.871
I'm just saying it's weird, that's all.

07:56.950 --> 08:00.854
I mean, last night I dream about this violent, scary guy, and today there he is?

08:01.203 --> 08:03.989
And he's all, "Howdy, ma'am, can I hold that elevator for you?"

08:04.213 --> 08:09.216
Am I a terrible husband if I interject here that your dreams are often subject to interpretation?

08:09.276 --> 08:11.959
- And that given the possible state of your hormones... 
- 66.

08:12.052 --> 08:13.342
Let's leave my hormones out of this.

08:13.398 --> 08:15.948
My hormones are innocent until proven impregnated.

08:16.024 --> 08:18.108
- So moved.
- Seventy-seven.

08:18.519 --> 08:20.203
Is that Ariel? Where are you?

08:20.361 --> 08:21.729
Home sweet home.

08:22.496 --> 08:24.653
I finished that DOD project ahead of schedule,

08:24.698 --> 08:27.489
so I figured I'd take the afternoon off and get a jump on tutoring.

08:27.715 --> 08:30.847
Oh, boy, you're really campaigning for father of the year, huh?

08:30.920 --> 08:32.302
Just trying to be helpful.

08:32.900 --> 08:34.390
Speaking of which,

08:34.591 --> 08:37.889
don't forget to bring everything home that we need to prepare for your test.

08:37.985 --> 08:40.960
Oh, yes, my little pop quiz-- I haven't forgotten.

08:41.159 --> 08:42.245
Very funny.

08:42.398 --> 08:45.886
And you'll be happy to know that Ariel does not have a problem with math.

08:45.982 --> 08:49.202
She's doing grade-level stuff here, she doesn't even have to work anything out.

08:49.316 --> 08:51.108
Clearly, she takes after her dad.

08:51.200 --> 08:53.279
- Oh, she snores?
- 51.

08:53.448 --> 08:54.538
Not so funny.

08:55.982 --> 08:58.164
- So, when you gonna take it?
- Take what?

08:58.705 --> 08:59.566
The test.

08:59.735 --> 09:02.997
Oh, I think you're supposed to take it in the morning. It's more accurate or something.

09:03.125 --> 09:04.476
So we have to wait all night?

09:04.616 --> 09:07.108
What's your rush? Thinking about painting the nursery blue?

09:07.384 --> 09:09.489
I'm actually at the drugstore right now.

09:09.744 --> 09:12.227
Tell Ariel to keep up the good work, and I'll see you later.

09:12.648 --> 09:15.458
Oh, they're having a sale on boys' disposable diapers.

09:15.535 --> 09:16.883
You want me to pick up a pack?

09:17.128 --> 09:19.755
Nah. I outgrew those a while ago.

09:20.085 --> 09:21.951
- Love you.
- You better.

09:34.613 --> 09:36.743
I look across at the other apartment, and...

09:37.081 --> 09:37.911
Yes?

09:40.956 --> 09:42.283
Allison, what's up?

09:42.594 --> 09:45.405
I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were in the middle of an interview.

09:45.867 --> 09:46.962
What can I help you with?

09:48.248 --> 09:50.781
Well, I was... done for the day,

09:50.879 --> 09:54.049
so I wanted to know if you needed anything, 'cause I thought I would...

09:57.648 --> 09:59.957
I'm sorry. You look so familiar.

10:02.430 --> 10:06.255
Jared Swanstrom, this is a colleague of mine, Allison Dubois.

10:06.357 --> 10:09.659
Allison, this is the gentleman who witnessed that robbery

10:09.736 --> 10:11.523
that I told you about that's been so helpful.

10:11.615 --> 10:14.989
Oh, right, that's it, the elevator this morning. Of course.

10:15.072 --> 10:17.027
Thank you so much for everything you're doing.

10:17.376 --> 10:20.995
Everyone keeps saying that. I guess I didn't realize I had another choice.

10:21.088 --> 10:23.821
Oh, you'd be amazed how apathetic most people are.

10:24.636 --> 10:26.622
It's a pleasure to meet somebody like you.

10:26.786 --> 10:27.912
It's a pleasure to meet you.

10:30.254 --> 10:31.511
- Allison?
- Excuse me.

10:33.756 --> 10:34.634
Excuse  me.

10:38.772 --> 10:41.367
Hey... you all right?

10:41.445 --> 10:42.392
Thank you.

10:43.075 --> 10:44.301
Do you want someone to drive you home?

10:44.363 --> 10:45.463
No, I'm okay.

10:50.508 --> 10:51.869
Have you seen your doctor?

10:52.136 --> 10:53.513
No, not yet.

10:54.409 --> 10:56.263
Is that what you think? No, no, no.

10:56.334 --> 10:58.326
It  has nothing to do with me-- it's him.

10:58.704 --> 11:00.481
He shook my hand, and he...

11:01.331 --> 11:04.675
he was saying something to me, but I couldn't hear what he was saying.

11:04.746 --> 11:06.508
Wait a second. What?

11:06.605 --> 11:09.445
You're saying that Swanstrom made you feel ill?

11:09.514 --> 11:12.901
It was like a... a dull roar in my head,

11:12.970 --> 11:16.870
and I could hear my... blood pulsing through me, and I saw things...

11:16.942 --> 11:18.422
All right, come on, let's sit down.

11:22.098 --> 11:24.658
Women. Murder, torture.

11:24.761 --> 11:26.445
There were so many of them, and he...

11:26.814 --> 11:29.159
I've never seen somebody so in their element.

11:29.574 --> 11:30.638
He's a killer.

11:31.114 --> 11:34.710
- Who's a killer, Allison?
- He is. That man.

11:35.640 --> 11:38.063
Your... Good Samaritan.

11:38.801 --> 11:41.422
He's killed women; he kills them, lots of them.

11:42.071 --> 11:45.445
Allison, maybe you should clarify your own condition before you speculate...

11:45.528 --> 11:47.637
- It has nothing to do with my own condition.
- I'm just saying...

11:47.735 --> 11:51.125
I've been pregnant before. I know what it is to be pregnant.

11:51.815 --> 11:55.189
- I've been pregnant three times-- this is not pregnant.
- All right.

11:55.347 --> 11:57.565
Whatever it is, we... we need to get you home.

11:57.938 --> 11:59.342
All right? Come on.

12:04.293 --> 12:06.006
You will check on him, right?

12:06.745 --> 12:11.055
If you go home and promise to relax, take a few days off, then... yeah.

12:15.429 --> 12:17.353
And you'll call me as soon as you get something?

12:17.435 --> 12:19.960
Allison, get some rest.

12:41.950 --> 12:42.970
You don't look good.

12:44.388 --> 12:47.065
Beautiful, but not terribly good.

12:47.508 --> 12:48.607
What's the matter?

12:48.802 --> 12:51.520
I had a little... episode.

12:52.012 --> 12:53.066
You have a tough day?

12:53.767 --> 12:56.962
Sort of. I puked in front of my boss.

12:57.132 --> 12:59.108
Was that before or after you asked for the raise?

13:00.726 --> 13:02.545
Come on, let's get you to bed.

13:15.968 --> 13:17.407
I feel so guilty.

13:17.580 --> 13:18.641
About what?

13:19.193 --> 13:20.996
You look so miserable, and I'm...

13:22.148 --> 13:23.366
I'm excited.

13:24.105 --> 13:25.389
It's not what you think.

13:25.835 --> 13:29.235
Oh, baby, I think it's time we had a chat about the birds and the bees.

13:29.331 --> 13:30.842
You're late, you're nauseous.

13:30.974 --> 13:33.068
Face it. I think we're talking table for six.

13:33.140 --> 13:34.522
Relax Maitre d'.

13:35.444 --> 13:38.004
It has nothing to do with the birds and the bees.

13:38.922 --> 13:40.503
I saw that man again.

13:41.134 --> 13:42.614
The one from my dream.

13:43.329 --> 13:44.696
The one I told you about.

13:45.246 --> 13:47.712
The solid citizen who saw the burglary?

13:48.204 --> 13:50.349
I touched him, I shook his hand.

13:50.810 --> 13:52.688
That's what made me ill.

13:54.097 --> 13:57.968
Allison, people get ill because something disturbs the body's chemical equilibrium,

13:58.633 --> 14:02.028
not because they shook hands with somebody who's...

14:02.110 --> 14:08.392
Evil? Joe, this man is evil in the most unimaginable ways.

14:08.961 --> 14:11.026
Because he looks so benign.

14:11.244 --> 14:13.292
Because he looks so friendly, so nice.

14:17.542 --> 14:18.919
And not only that.

14:19.932 --> 14:22.790
He has a kind of radar for innocence.

14:23.822 --> 14:26.303
He can spot it a mile away.

14:27.137 --> 14:28.720
And  once he's found it,

14:30.111 --> 14:33.010
he becomes obsessed with possessing it.

14:34.587 --> 14:36.659
He seems so harmless...

14:38.159 --> 14:41.458
so when he offers them a ride, they almost always accept.

14:44.006 --> 14:49.082
Then he drugs them, and by the time they come to, they're tied up somewhere, helpless.

14:50.939 --> 14:54.401
Then he rapes them, bathes them.

14:54.605 --> 14:57.622
Rapes them again, drugs them some more.

14:58.338 --> 15:02.624
And when he can no longer convince himself of their innocence, he kills them...

15:05.024 --> 15:08.291
takes their bodies, puts them in their car, drives them to the desert

15:08.352 --> 15:12.608
and dumps them there for the animals to feast on.

15:14.114 --> 15:15.848
There have been lots of them.

15:16.330 --> 15:17.574
Maybe six.

15:18.024 --> 15:21.235
But there's this one woman in particular I keep seeing.

15:22.168 --> 15:25.075
She has red hair, blue eyes.

15:25.776 --> 15:27.174
A beautiful girl.

15:27.450 --> 15:30.093
She told him her name was Sharona.

15:30.381 --> 15:32.120
She was his first.

15:32.504 --> 15:34.635
He didn't really want to part with her.

15:35.288 --> 15:37.206
He loved her in his own way,

15:37.470 --> 15:40.574
but the smell was beginning to become noticeable.

15:41.756 --> 15:46.078
And even as he walked her body towards its sandy, dusty resting place,

15:46.590 --> 15:48.847
he swore he'd never do this again.

15:49.553 --> 15:52.733
Never fall in love with someone only to have to part with them.

15:53.794 --> 15:56.235
But even as he made the promise,

15:56.743 --> 15:58.570
he knew he couldn't keep it.

16:01.102 --> 16:02.416
Honey?

16:04.423 --> 16:05.462
Honey?

16:12.309 --> 16:13.716
How was your day?

16:17.746 --> 16:20.617
Would you do me a favor and go get me one of those tests?

16:21.637 --> 16:22.896
What are you talking about?

16:23.587 --> 16:26.320
Well, if I'm not pregnant, I really want a drink.

16:27.397 --> 16:29.649
I thought you said mornings were more accurate.

16:29.731 --> 16:31.584
I did say that, didn't I?

16:31.923 --> 16:33.622
That was stupid of me.

16:36.552 --> 16:38.077
Get some rest, Al.

16:47.955 --> 16:49.004
Morning.

16:49.883 --> 16:50.871
Allison?

16:52.137 --> 16:53.743
It's barely 8:20.

16:53.984 --> 16:56.022
Nobody's even here for another 40 minutes.

16:56.104 --> 16:58.346
Well, I had to run the kids to school, so I just thought...

16:58.408 --> 17:01.009
I don't remember asking you to come in this morning.

17:01.453 --> 17:04.300
I mean, how are you? You feeling better?

17:04.404 --> 17:05.249
A little.

17:05.551 --> 17:08.888
You didn't. I actually came in sort of on my own.

17:08.944 --> 17:10.881
I was wondering about Jared Swanstrom.

17:10.992 --> 17:13.143
Jared Swanstrom? Yeah, what about him?

17:13.224 --> 17:16.278
Well, you promised me you'd look into his background. Check him out.

17:18.387 --> 17:20.358
I guess you haven't had a chance yet.

17:20.638 --> 17:23.972
Allison, it's not the habit of the District Attorney's office

17:24.054 --> 17:28.433
to run criminal background checks on citizens who come forward to report crimes.

17:28.530 --> 17:31.350
- Well, you told me you'd check it out.
- And you told me that you'd get some rest.

17:31.437 --> 17:33.676
- I feel fine.
- Well, you don't look fine.

17:33.808 --> 17:38.114
And you're not acting fine. You're acting a bit paranoid. A bit obsessive.

17:38.587 --> 17:39.926
Allison, please go home.

17:40.096 --> 17:43.701
I'll call you when and if there's a reason to.

17:44.012 --> 17:47.141
But you will check, right? You are going to run his name.

17:47.213 --> 17:48.278
You did promise.

17:52.567 --> 17:55.175
And there's a girl. A victim, I think.

17:55.262 --> 17:56.839
She has red hair. Her name's Sharona.

17:56.933 --> 17:59.890
She's a student, a local. Arizona State, maybe.

18:00.464 --> 18:04.125
Could you just check and see if maybe there's a missing persons report?

18:04.227 --> 18:05.906
Something open? Please?

18:06.004 --> 18:06.889
All right, Allison.

18:08.825 --> 18:10.007
Thank you.

18:11.626 --> 18:13.003
I'll wait for your call.

18:17.175 --> 18:19.300
I have much good news to report.

18:19.408 --> 18:21.102
I shall be the judge of that.

18:21.236 --> 18:24.569
All persons under five feet of height are officially in bed.

18:24.727 --> 18:25.674
I'm proud of you.

18:25.757 --> 18:27.600
And reporting from the math front,

18:28.025 --> 18:31.374
I think if you take a look at these equations I did with Ariel this evening,

18:31.490 --> 18:35.050
it'll become pretty damn obvious that her only problem with fourth grade math

18:35.268 --> 18:37.804
- is that it isn't tenth grade math.
- Excuse me?

18:37.866 --> 18:39.058
She's bored, Al.

18:39.447 --> 18:40.861
She's advanced.

18:41.597 --> 18:44.091
Look at these. I put together some geometry problems.

18:44.337 --> 18:47.035
Geometry? Joe, you're giving her geometry?

18:47.097 --> 18:48.407
She's nine years old.

18:48.495 --> 18:51.070
And  nine rhymes with Einstein.

18:51.485 --> 18:52.704
Sort of.

18:53.124 --> 18:55.674
I'm telling you, she did a spectacular job.

18:55.771 --> 18:58.008
She's performing way above grade level.

18:58.192 --> 19:00.087
Frankly, she reminds me of me.

19:00.400 --> 19:04.224
A nine-year-old girl reminds you of you? Hmm.

19:04.583 --> 19:08.115
You're taking a perfectly sweet figure of speech and you're turning it into something...

19:08.197 --> 19:10.732
I don't even want to contemplate what you must be thinking.

19:10.814 --> 19:12.277
Why are you staring at the phone?

19:12.528 --> 19:13.802
It's almost 9:30.

19:14.094 --> 19:15.385
Are you expecting a call?

19:15.549 --> 19:17.151
The DA's office.

19:17.955 --> 19:20.121
- But it's not going to happen.
- How do you know?

19:20.255 --> 19:23.132
I went in to see him today. I told him about my dreams.

19:23.654 --> 19:24.510
Really?

19:26.112 --> 19:27.618
After you took the test?

19:29.368 --> 19:30.326
Allison...

19:31.836 --> 19:35.369
Peeing in the morning is kind of automatic, honey. I just didn't think about it.

19:37.771 --> 19:38.938
Right.

19:40.459 --> 19:42.778
So you forgot to use the test this morning.

19:44.393 --> 19:46.730
Well, I suppose there's more pee where that came from.

19:46.828 --> 19:48.026
You can bet on it.

19:50.587 --> 19:52.839
I guess I'll still sleep with you tonight.

19:53.261 --> 19:55.516
Thank you, kind sir.

20:01.616 --> 20:02.889
Nothing?

20:03.043 --> 20:05.587
Less than nothing. Naught.

20:06.637 --> 20:12.362
He was never suspected of murder, but he does volunteer at a homeless shelter once a month.

20:12.490 --> 20:15.448
No arrests for assault, but he does attend church regularly.

20:15.536 --> 20:17.957
No speeding tickets or parking tickets,

20:18.030 --> 20:21.322
and he is a mentor to a fatherless boy in Tempe.

20:22.260 --> 20:25.115
I was thinking of asking the mayor to give him the key to the city, but I was afraid

20:25.167 --> 20:29.038
his Honor would be threatened in the presence of someone with so much moral fiber.

20:29.744 --> 20:32.750
And you might find it comforting to know there have been no red-headed women

20:32.775 --> 20:36.815
named Sharona reported missing or murdered in this state since 1983.

20:38.463 --> 20:39.611
Okay.

20:40.748 --> 20:42.462
Allison, this is good news.

20:43.598 --> 20:45.510
Sometimes it's good to be wrong.

20:46.184 --> 20:48.007
- Mommy?
- Yeah?

20:48.093 --> 20:50.926
Look. Daddy said I got them all right.

20:51.135 --> 20:55.022
Wow. Wow, this looks complicated, sweetie.

20:55.241 --> 20:58.314
I know, but it wasn't. Daddy was really happy.

20:58.811 --> 21:01.242
He's very proud of you. He told me so.

21:02.527 --> 21:03.787
Mommy?

21:06.199 --> 21:09.701
Do you think Daddy sometimes wishes I was a boy?

21:11.197 --> 21:12.184
No.

21:13.798 --> 21:17.509
Daddy loves you very much just the way you are.

21:18.130 --> 21:20.592
Okay. Just checking.

21:21.488 --> 21:22.548
Mommy?

21:23.843 --> 21:26.419
You won't let the bad man hurt us, will you?

21:27.084 --> 21:30.084
- What bad man?
- I think she's talking about me.

21:41.124 --> 21:42.142
Damn.

21:43.104 --> 21:45.353
I was thinking. I got distracted.

21:47.100 --> 21:49.238
Yeah. That thinking will do that every time.

21:49.971 --> 21:51.701
The bad Samaritan, I presume?

21:51.824 --> 21:53.728
Stop giving him cute names.

21:55.428 --> 21:57.528
I was thinking about his guts, actually.

21:57.615 --> 21:59.791
Small intestine? Large intestine?

22:00.042 --> 22:01.480
Not those kind of guts?

22:01.982 --> 22:03.216
Think about it.

22:04.219 --> 22:07.917
You've kidnapped, tortured and killed a handful of women

22:08.131 --> 22:10.030
and raised absolutely no suspicion.

22:10.129 --> 22:14.911
I mean, if you're any kind of self-respecting sociopath who takes any kind of pride in their work,

22:16.302 --> 22:18.878
that must to be absolutely intoxicating, right?

22:18.961 --> 22:21.444
I was thinking the kids aren't going to be up for another 15 minutes

22:21.506 --> 22:23.245
and I was going to ask you if you want to have sex, but,

22:23.318 --> 22:26.589
I don't know, you started talking and the urge just suddenly left me.

22:26.685 --> 22:30.449
How do you up that rush? How do you sustain that thrill?

22:30.634 --> 22:34.309
By walking into the district attorney's office and offering to help him solve a crime.

22:34.386 --> 22:35.553
That's pretty gutty.

22:35.620 --> 22:37.525
- Or?
- Or?

22:37.583 --> 22:39.886
Or there's no guts involved because he didn't do it.

22:40.182 --> 22:41.605
Because it never happened.

22:42.226 --> 22:43.884
Because he's just a good Samaritan.

22:43.957 --> 22:45.392
Because there are no dead co-eds.

22:45.456 --> 22:48.108
Because this whole scenario exists only...

22:50.053 --> 22:51.569
Because I might be pregnant?

22:51.960 --> 22:54.565
Or because you don't want to deal with the possibility. I don't know.

22:54.687 --> 22:58.548
All I know is, it takes a lot less energy to piss on a piece of plastic

22:58.657 --> 23:02.666
than it does to ponder the twisted courage of a man you've met for all of two minutes.

23:10.805 --> 23:11.984
Swanson...

23:13.796 --> 23:15.137
Swanstrom.

23:15.803 --> 23:17.687
Jared Swanstrom.

23:18.301 --> 23:21.660
Arrogant bastard's even listed in the phone book.

23:49.006 --> 23:52.663
This is dumb. This is, like, the dumbest thing I've ever done in my life.

24:29.941 --> 24:31.866
Yes, hi. This is Allison Dubois.

24:31.932 --> 24:33.828
I work with the district attorney's office.

24:35.312 --> 24:36.705
Yes, this is an emergency.

24:36.808 --> 24:39.378
I have reason to believe I'm following a car

24:39.439 --> 24:42.430
that's being used to transport the dead body of a murder victim.

24:43.176 --> 24:45.947
Dubois. D-U-B-O-I-S.

24:47.945 --> 24:49.981
No. No one's being murdered right now,

24:50.294 --> 24:52.516
but I believe the murderer is in the process of getting away

24:52.567 --> 24:55.297
or at the very least attempting to destroy the evidence.

24:55.657 --> 24:58.071
His license plate is 1-2-6...

24:58.271 --> 24:59.792
F-I-O.

25:01.528 --> 25:06.121
I don't know. I'm... at the corner of Chaparral and Miller, traveling north.

25:09.277 --> 25:11.911
No. I already told you-- no one is being murdered right now.

25:13.857 --> 25:16.161
What do you mean, "Is he breaking any other laws?"

25:16.258 --> 25:19.827
I told you. I believe there is a dead body in his trunk.

25:24.118 --> 25:27.702
Look, I can't drive and talk at the same time. He's getting away.

25:28.818 --> 25:30.544
He's getting on the freeway.

25:32.622 --> 25:35.472
What do you mean, that's outside your jurisdiction? Oh, hell.

25:41.070 --> 25:45.344
Yes. I'm talking about a crime happening right now, or an accident anyway.

25:45.432 --> 25:49.810
We are at the Chaparral on-ramp. Not on the freeway, still in your jurisdiction.

25:50.198 --> 25:53.188
Yes, ma'am. No, I did it. I hit him with my car. Now, hurry. Please.

25:53.268 --> 25:55.708
- Are you okay?!
- He's approaching my vehicle!

25:56.599 --> 25:59.062
Did I, did I stop short or something?

26:00.281 --> 26:03.296
Hey, I know you. You're the woman from the D.A.'s. Are you okay?

26:05.703 --> 26:08.166
Okay, they're here. They're here. Thank you.

26:10.265 --> 26:14.207
Sir, move away from the window. Move away from the window, okay?

26:14.386 --> 26:15.205
Just back off.

26:19.076 --> 26:20.090
You all right, ma'am?

26:20.330 --> 26:22.266
We're fine. You're fine, right? She's fine.

26:22.338 --> 26:25.410
- Great, I need to see your license and registration, please.
- Okay, but I think we can work this out ourselves.

26:28.123 --> 26:31.133
Sir, turn around and put your hands on the hood. I need you to spread your feet, okay?

26:31.221 --> 26:31.937
Excuse me?

26:32.040 --> 26:33.597
I'm going to have an officer pat you down.

26:35.163 --> 26:37.365
- You call 911, ma'am?
- Yes, Officer.

26:37.795 --> 26:41.067
Is this the man... driving the vehicle you claim has a body in the trunk?

26:41.138 --> 26:42.338
What? What did you tell them?

26:42.552 --> 26:44.149
Sir, we're gonna have to look in the trunk.

26:45.005 --> 26:46.786
All right, this is crazy. I mean, this is a joke, right?

26:46.909 --> 26:50.472
- You have no right to look in my car.
- Let me tell you how this works, okay?

26:50.897 --> 26:53.611
You're gonna open the trunk willingly, or I'm gonna take you downtown

26:53.683 --> 26:55.362
and we're all gonna sit around while I get a warrant.

26:55.423 --> 26:57.297
It's not a question of if, it's a question of when.

26:57.400 --> 26:59.702
- Wait. Why'd you do this? Why did you call them?
- Hey, hey! Sir.

26:59.788 --> 27:02.187
Why don't you direct all your comments and questions at me, okay?

27:02.290 --> 27:03.190
I don't understand.

27:03.329 --> 27:05.361
I witnessed a robbery and now this, this...

27:05.448 --> 27:06.805
Hey. Watch yourself, okay?

27:06.892 --> 27:11.183
Just, this woman from the D.A.'s office is stalking me.

27:12.718 --> 27:14.880
Ma'am? Your story hasn't changed, has it?

27:14.962 --> 27:16.343
I know what I saw.

27:16.539 --> 27:17.741
He killed a woman.

27:17.829 --> 27:20.645
Then he rolled her up in a rug and put her in his trunk.

27:21.157 --> 27:22.734
Officer, that's completely absurd.

27:23.195 --> 27:24.925
All right, look. This is your last chance.

27:25.172 --> 27:28.115
- Fine. Fine.
- Good. let's have a look.

27:29.662 --> 27:30.731
Hold onto this.

27:36.522 --> 27:37.920
That's the rug, but...

27:39.272 --> 27:41.827
Yeah. But what?

27:42.001 --> 27:44.254
The one that I saw was older. It was stained.

27:44.555 --> 27:47.346
I don't know what you "saw," but this rug is brand new.

27:48.084 --> 27:51.088
My friend works at a carpet warehouse and they just went out of business. He left this for me.

27:51.160 --> 27:53.755
- I picked it up this morning.
- I don't know what to tell you.

27:53.859 --> 27:56.445
- Well, I'd start with "I'm sorry."
- Thank you.

27:56.516 --> 27:58.052
- I'm sorry.
- Thanks.

27:58.508 --> 28:00.484
I'm gonna issue you two summonses, Ms. Dubois.

28:00.566 --> 28:03.413
One for reckless driving, and the other for filing a false report.

28:03.485 --> 28:05.927
- But, Officer, wait.
- Don't compound the situation, okay?

28:05.999 --> 28:08.190
I'll also gonna file a report with the D.A's office and let them know

28:08.246 --> 28:11.595
that you summoned for police assistance here when there wasn't a need for it, okay?

28:11.877 --> 28:15.399
Sir, you want to file harassment charges against Ms. Dubois?

28:19.203 --> 28:21.158
No. No. Not at this time.

28:21.257 --> 28:23.500
Good. Now, I want you both to get back in your vehicles,

28:23.595 --> 28:25.751
call your insurance companies, and be on your way.

28:25.834 --> 28:27.590
- Do I make myself clear?
- Yes, sir.

28:27.676 --> 28:29.249
Perfectly.

28:29.540 --> 28:30.308
Damn.

28:37.245 --> 28:39.589
Does Daddy know that you crushed the car?

28:39.682 --> 28:41.091
Yes, I called him.

28:41.732 --> 28:44.153
Daddy is going to kill you when he gets home.

28:44.250 --> 28:46.400
Ariel... Mommies and daddies don't kill each other.

28:46.472 --> 28:48.531
Sometimes they get disappointed. Sometimes they get annoyed,

28:48.612 --> 28:50.988
but by and large, mommies and daddies don't kill each other.

28:53.124 --> 28:54.505
Okay, sweetie.

28:55.326 --> 28:56.702
Let's have a tea party.

28:57.694 --> 29:00.055
Now, let's do homework.

29:03.153 --> 29:04.787
What? You don't have any homework?

29:05.236 --> 29:08.996
No. I do, but I sorta want to wait for Daddy to get home.

29:09.062 --> 29:11.908
Well, Daddy's got his class tonight. He won't be home till late. Can I help?

29:12.040 --> 29:15.881
No, I don't think so. It's math, and he really makes math easy.

29:15.949 --> 29:17.136
Well, I know math.

29:17.729 --> 29:18.723
Sort of.

29:20.217 --> 29:21.642
I'll tell you what.

29:21.856 --> 29:25.297
You get your book and I'll get my abacus, and we'll give it a shot.

29:34.207 --> 29:36.680
No... I need Daddy.

29:37.110 --> 29:38.667
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

29:38.738 --> 29:39.515
Why?

29:42.701 --> 29:45.445
Because he gives me the answers.

29:46.330 --> 29:49.536
Wait a second. Daddy does not give you the answers.

29:50.770 --> 29:54.580
Well... he kind of shows them to me.

29:57.160 --> 29:59.684
What do you mean, he shows them to you, darling?

30:00.979 --> 30:01.963
I don't know.

30:02.453 --> 30:04.347
He looks at the problem with me,

30:05.711 --> 30:09.150
and I just see the numbers in my head and I just write them down.

30:13.717 --> 30:16.703
And you don't see any numbers when you're with me, right?

30:16.868 --> 30:23.399
Yeah... I do, but they have letters in them, too, so I know they can't be right.

30:26.294 --> 30:27.311
Okay...

30:29.271 --> 30:30.429
Tell you what.

30:30.898 --> 30:32.728
Write them down. Show them to me.

30:49.333 --> 30:50.819
Watch Marie for second.

30:51.273 --> 30:52.481
What about my homework?

30:53.551 --> 30:54.658
I'll just need a second.

30:55.743 --> 30:57.218
Try to work it out for yourself.

30:57.356 --> 30:59.337
Work it out?

31:20.078 --> 31:21.789
District Attorney, Devalos' office.

31:21.855 --> 31:23.591
Hi. This is Allison Dubois.

31:23.811 --> 31:26.929
I have this license plate number I need to check for this case I'm working on.

31:26.995 --> 31:28.926
I think it might be a rental car.

31:29.013 --> 31:31.665
Well, to be honest, the police usually handle that kind of thing.

31:31.737 --> 31:33.268
You know, I used to work over there.

31:33.499 --> 31:36.888
Why don't you give it to me and I'll call it over and see what I can find out.

31:36.975 --> 31:38.131
Terrific. Thank you.

31:38.210 --> 31:42.433
Okay, the number is "4-2-7-Q-U-I."

31:42.857 --> 31:45.454
Did you say "Q-U-I"?

31:45.546 --> 31:46.500
Are you sure about that?

31:46.804 --> 31:47.757
What do you mean?

31:48.167 --> 31:53.691
Well, if I remember correctly, the first letter on an Arizona plate advances with each new run.

31:53.754 --> 31:55.954
Right now, we're issuing plates with "F."

31:56.155 --> 31:59.430
I believe the plate you just read me doesn't exist yet.

32:00.077 --> 32:02.190
What do you mean? When will it exist?

32:02.840 --> 32:06.430
I'm guessing we'll get to Q anywhere from seven to ten years from now.

32:08.755 --> 32:10.743
Mommy...

32:13.425 --> 32:16.026
Mommy...

32:17.413 --> 32:18.380
Joe?

32:18.534 --> 32:20.106
Mommy...

32:24.012 --> 32:26.557
Mommy...

32:30.705 --> 32:33.274
Mommy...

32:36.793 --> 32:39.747
I think you owe me an apology, Allison.

33:20.692 --> 33:22.003
Trouble sleeping?

33:23.097 --> 33:23.872
No.

33:25.530 --> 33:27.082
Sleeping's easy.

33:27.281 --> 33:29.344
Sleeping's a dream.

33:30.241 --> 33:33.415
It's the waking stuff that can really screw with your head.

33:40.007 --> 33:41.734
I don't know what to tell you, Joe.

33:44.158 --> 33:46.614
I guess I didn't take the test because I was...

33:47.464 --> 33:48.436
afraid.

33:50.562 --> 33:52.518
Afraid I would be pregnant.

33:53.265 --> 33:55.093
Afraid I wouldn't be.

33:56.680 --> 34:00.909
Depending on the time of day, I guess I just didn't really like either choice.

34:03.679 --> 34:05.175
I'm sorry.

34:07.115 --> 34:08.174
Me, too.

34:18.011 --> 34:18.918
But you know what?

34:20.248 --> 34:22.797
We already have three great kids.

34:26.992 --> 34:29.387
Yeah, I need to talk to you about that, too.

34:29.597 --> 34:30.427
Okay.

34:33.016 --> 34:35.177
Our wonderful daughter Ariel,

34:36.157 --> 34:41.788
who is so beautiful and smart and exceptional in so many ways...

34:42.630 --> 34:47.108
just isn't exceptional in the way you hoped.

34:54.132 --> 34:56.460
She doesn't take after me at all, does she?

34:58.643 --> 35:00.072
She takes after you.

35:05.509 --> 35:09.522
By the time we got to advanced algebra, I suspected.

35:11.018 --> 35:13.471
But I guess I didn't really want to know for sure.

35:14.812 --> 35:17.163
I guess there's a lot of that going around.

35:19.415 --> 35:21.771
So, ask me about my case.

35:21.863 --> 35:23.061
How goes the case?

35:23.609 --> 35:26.159
It's going, it's going, it's gone.

35:26.308 --> 35:27.198
Really.

35:32.134 --> 35:34.714
Because it never really happened.

35:36.163 --> 35:38.626
Because he really is a good Samaritan.

35:39.839 --> 35:42.450
Because there are no dead co-eds.

35:44.308 --> 35:47.759
Because the whole thing only existed...

36:08.803 --> 36:10.533
Hi. Is he in?

36:10.589 --> 36:12.217
Court. Was he expecting you?

36:12.299 --> 36:17.061
No. I thought I'd surprise him. I have to do a little fence mending, some apologizing.

36:17.133 --> 36:18.899
I saw the fax from the Chief of Police.

36:18.997 --> 36:21.055
Which reminds me, there's something here for you.

36:21.311 --> 36:24.936
Didn't you ask us to check on a possible missing "Sharona"?

36:25.971 --> 36:28.941
- College student with red hair?
- Yeah.

36:29.073 --> 36:33.138
No. Not only are there none missing, there's been only been one Sharona born

36:33.200 --> 36:37.071
within a 50-mile radius of Phoenix since 1980, and she's only 14.

36:40.040 --> 36:41.290
Wait a second.

36:49.938 --> 36:50.982
Sharona?

36:51.458 --> 36:53.189
I'm sorry, do I know you?

36:54.157 --> 36:57.059
No. But I need to talk to you for a second.

36:57.755 --> 37:00.101
It's okay, really. We can do it right here.

37:01.226 --> 37:04.385
My name is Allison Dubois and I need to tell you something.

37:04.460 --> 37:06.626
And you're going to think it sounds sort of crazy.

37:06.690 --> 37:08.744
You're going to think I'm some weird old lady

37:08.811 --> 37:12.235
who you met at school who told you this strange story,

37:12.343 --> 37:13.695
and that's fine.

37:14.053 --> 37:16.228
As long as you just listen.

37:17.576 --> 37:18.875
Okay.

37:19.593 --> 37:21.324
Seven years from now,

37:21.851 --> 37:24.539
a man is going to come up to you on the street.

37:25.123 --> 37:28.184
You'll be in college, you'll be very pretty.

37:28.527 --> 37:32.813
You'll be carrying your books and one of your shoelaces will be untied.

37:33.176 --> 37:37.517
This man, he'll offer to hold your books while you tie your shoelace.

37:37.861 --> 37:39.606
He'll seem nice and polite

37:39.837 --> 37:43.047
and you'll think, "maybe a little old for me but harmless."

37:43.288 --> 37:45.362
But he isn't harmless.

37:45.592 --> 37:48.982
He will rape you and murder you if you let him.

37:49.765 --> 37:53.037
So when he offers you a ride, say no.

37:53.231 --> 37:56.098
And then just walk away.

37:56.185 --> 37:57.752
And if he won't let you,

37:58.260 --> 38:01.285
then you fight, scream,

38:01.433 --> 38:03.041
bite him, kick him.

38:03.600 --> 38:07.107
Just promise me you won't get in that car, okay?

38:07.250 --> 38:08.391
Promise me.

38:08.998 --> 38:11.644
Wait a sec, you came here to tell me

38:11.875 --> 38:15.252
about something you think might happen seven years from now?

38:15.350 --> 38:18.894
Just promise me you will fight like hell. Promise me.

38:18.980 --> 38:20.992
Look, lady, you're right, this is crazy.

38:21.100 --> 38:24.448
Sharona! You don't have to believe anything I say.

38:25.230 --> 38:27.444
You just have to remember it.

38:27.976 --> 38:29.937
You will, won't you?

38:31.110 --> 38:32.231
I can tell.

38:32.635 --> 38:34.115
And you will fight.

38:35.984 --> 38:38.242
And you're going to have a great life.

38:57.844 --> 38:58.894
Slam dunk.

38:59.098 --> 39:01.779
Judge took about a minute and half to decide to throw the book

39:01.839 --> 39:06.396
at Phoenix's favorite cat burglar thanks to the testimony of our good friend here.

39:07.032 --> 39:08.261
How's your car?

39:09.803 --> 39:11.415
You and I need to talk.

39:11.661 --> 39:12.694
Tomorrow.

39:13.559 --> 39:14.518
Jared.

39:20.114 --> 39:21.604
I gotta tell you, lady,

39:22.545 --> 39:23.891
you floor me.

39:24.501 --> 39:28.326
After all I've done, all I'm doing, why would... why would you do what you did?

39:28.382 --> 39:30.047
Why did you say those things to the police?

39:30.127 --> 39:31.035
I'm sorry.

39:31.127 --> 39:33.840
- Well, you ought to be.
- But it's true.

39:34.337 --> 39:35.171
Excuse me?

39:35.258 --> 39:37.788
Or it will be... in the next seven to ten years.

39:37.859 --> 39:41.915
What? This is crazy. I have never hurt anybody.

39:41.997 --> 39:45.622
- I could never hurt anyone.
- Then don't.

39:46.195 --> 39:50.625
Look, I don't know who it is that breaks your heart or crushes your spirit

39:50.680 --> 39:54.141
or pushes you over that line that people like you cross so easily...

39:54.208 --> 39:58.391
- No one's going to break my heart.
- Admit it, you think about it all the time.

39:58.530 --> 40:02.580
You think about how you'll do it-- what it'll feel like,

40:02.815 --> 40:05.677
what they'll smell like, what they'll taste like.

40:05.881 --> 40:08.017
You know who you really are.

40:08.949 --> 40:10.153
You're the golem.

40:11.350 --> 40:12.702
You're the devil.

40:13.463 --> 40:14.980
You're a monster.

40:16.767 --> 40:18.268
Now do me a favor.

40:18.610 --> 40:20.432
Do the world a favor.

40:20.591 --> 40:23.152
Make a liar out of me.

40:29.197 --> 40:30.856
Tell Mr. Devalos I had to go.

40:30.957 --> 40:32.194
I'll do that.

40:40.744 --> 40:41.800
You're wrong.

40:48.787 --> 40:50.138
Let's hope so.
