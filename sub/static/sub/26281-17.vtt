00:00.400 --> 00:02.306
<i>Previously on "The Good Doctor"...</i>

00:02.308 --> 00:05.104
<i>Dr. Murphy, you shouldn't
be in contact with patients.</i>

00:05.106 --> 00:07.295
Or their families. Do you understand?

00:07.297 --> 00:08.487
Don't be stupid.

00:08.489 --> 00:09.708
What? There's no cameras in here.

00:13.701 --> 00:15.768
Dr. Lim, Dr. Melendez.

00:18.205 --> 00:21.474
I do not want to be a pathologist.

00:21.476 --> 00:25.611
Dr. Han, you need to make me
a surgical resident again.

00:33.421 --> 00:35.054
Hey.

00:35.056 --> 00:38.324
What are you doing up so early?

00:38.326 --> 00:39.692
I'm not up early.

00:39.694 --> 00:41.060
I never went to bed.

00:41.062 --> 00:42.895
Oh, my God. Didn't you get my text?

00:42.897 --> 00:44.903
I told you I was spending
the night with Jake.

00:47.034 --> 00:51.118
I don't want to be a pathologist.

00:51.639 --> 00:52.939
Oh.

00:52.941 --> 00:55.608
It's... that still.

00:57.111 --> 00:58.667
Shaun...

00:59.247 --> 01:02.921
no one's life goes exactly
like they dreamed as a kid.

01:04.650 --> 01:08.154
You're still a doctor.
Still saving lives.

01:08.156 --> 01:10.957
Just in a lab instead of
an operating room.

01:20.769 --> 01:21.934
Where are you going?

01:21.936 --> 01:24.237
I'm going to walk to work.

01:24.239 --> 01:26.239
The hospital's four miles away.

01:26.241 --> 01:31.077
Studies have shown that walking
boosts creative inspiration.

01:31.079 --> 01:33.579
- Shaun, I just think...
- You don't understand.

01:33.581 --> 01:35.581
You don't understand.

01:40.054 --> 01:41.921
Neither does Dr. Han.

01:45.893 --> 01:48.895
I need to change his mind.

01:48.897 --> 01:50.463
I don't know how.

01:59.173 --> 02:01.774
Mm, we're gonna be late.

02:01.776 --> 02:03.276
So stop.

02:08.550 --> 02:10.049
Mm.

02:10.050 --> 02:12.451
And don't be smiling at me
when you see me in the hall.

02:12.453 --> 02:15.454
I smile at everyone. I'm a friendly guy.

02:15.456 --> 02:17.290
You'd be a horrible poker player.

02:31.039 --> 02:32.538
- What're you doing?
- Murphy's on the corner.

02:32.540 --> 02:33.739
Move it.

02:33.741 --> 02:35.208
That's not where his bus drops off.

02:35.210 --> 02:36.742
Do you think he saw us?

02:36.744 --> 02:37.910
He's not looking over here.

02:37.912 --> 02:39.946
Well, that doesn't
mean anything with him.

02:39.948 --> 02:41.848
We got to get out of here
before the light turns.

02:43.450 --> 02:45.218
Let's go! Move it!

03:02.637 --> 03:06.038
Through the generous support of St.
Bonaventure Foundation,

03:06.040 --> 03:08.608
we've been able to transport
Kenny and his mother

03:08.610 --> 03:10.176
from their home in Mississippi.

03:10.178 --> 03:11.444
And we'll be covering the costs

03:11.446 --> 03:14.013
of surgery and post-op recovery.

03:14.015 --> 03:16.048
And all I have to do
is buy one CD a month

03:16.050 --> 03:17.350
for the next 100 years.

03:19.187 --> 03:21.754
No repayment necessary.

03:21.756 --> 03:24.891
We appreciate you allowing us
to share your case

03:24.893 --> 03:27.793
as an educational opportunity
for our staff.

03:27.795 --> 03:31.030
You know what they say...
those who can't... teach.

03:31.032 --> 03:33.633
And as you can see,
I can't do much of anything.

03:35.870 --> 03:38.838
Actually, y'all haven't
really seen anything yet.

03:38.840 --> 03:40.746
How about we get this party started?

03:42.442 --> 03:45.244
The neurofibroma started as a small bump

03:45.246 --> 03:47.079
near the base of the spine.

03:53.087 --> 03:54.553
In less than six months,

03:54.555 --> 03:57.957
it encircled his abdomen
and grew to over 100 pounds,

03:57.959 --> 04:00.860
the blood supply becoming so
intertwined with the patient's,

04:00.862 --> 04:03.329
it was deemed inoperable.

04:03.331 --> 04:05.831
But we've been able to come up
with an innovative surgical plan

04:05.833 --> 04:08.100
that will allow us
to slowly peel the tumor

04:08.102 --> 04:11.537
off the front and back
of his torso in one piece

04:11.539 --> 04:13.839
and give Kenny his life back.

Synced & corrected by -robtor-

04:25.553 --> 04:27.586
We didn't expect to see you.

04:27.588 --> 04:31.023
This is just about logistics,
witness lists, scheduling.

04:31.025 --> 04:32.224
The hospital's attorney

04:32.226 --> 04:33.960
could've handled this
on his own, Dr. Han.

04:33.962 --> 04:36.862
I understand, but I wanted to be here.

04:36.864 --> 04:38.464
Three reasons really.

04:38.466 --> 04:40.333
If my doctors are gonna be
judged in this room,

04:40.335 --> 04:41.901
I wanted to see the place,

04:41.903 --> 04:43.703
see all of you, and see the mood...

04:43.705 --> 04:45.504
Well, we try to make it very casual.

04:45.506 --> 04:48.007
I know.

04:48.009 --> 04:49.942
But have you ever been judged?

04:49.944 --> 04:51.577
I have.

04:51.579 --> 04:53.012
It's scary.

04:53.014 --> 04:54.280
Someone has gone to the trouble

04:54.282 --> 04:56.515
of checking out
every aspect of your actions,

04:56.517 --> 04:58.150
every decision you've made.

04:58.152 --> 05:01.220
You don't know what they know,
what they're gonna ask,

05:01.222 --> 05:03.662
what could be misunderstood,
misinterpreted.

05:05.225 --> 05:07.693
Also, and this is kind of embarrassing,

05:07.695 --> 05:10.830
but our lawyer...

05:10.832 --> 05:13.399
probably not the best.

05:13.401 --> 05:15.034
I decided to save a few dollars on him.

05:15.036 --> 05:17.470
So I could hire a private investigator...

05:17.472 --> 05:19.805
check all of <i>you</i> out.

05:19.807 --> 05:22.274
We're not the ones on trial here.

05:22.276 --> 05:24.210
See?

05:24.212 --> 05:27.013
You say you make it casual,
and then you call it a trial.

05:27.015 --> 05:29.048
Now, I'm sure she won't find anything.

05:29.050 --> 05:31.017
I mean, nothing too crazy, right?

05:31.019 --> 05:34.776
Maybe just something... embarrassing.

05:35.256 --> 05:38.238
Maybe a lapse of judgment here or there.

05:39.060 --> 05:40.159
I mean, like I was saying,

05:40.161 --> 05:43.095
you parse every choice anyone has made,

05:43.097 --> 05:45.297
gonna be a few things
they'd rather not revisit.

05:45.299 --> 05:46.532
Am I right?

05:49.002 --> 05:50.202
And the third reason?

05:52.672 --> 05:55.107
I thought maybe you'd want
to work out a compromise.

06:07.388 --> 06:09.088
The surgery went well.

06:09.090 --> 06:10.956
We were able to fully evacuate

06:10.958 --> 06:13.626
the subdural hematoma
without any complications.

06:17.230 --> 06:19.899
It's a good thing you didn't
hesitate to bring her in.

06:19.901 --> 06:22.201
Oh. One advantage of being
an insecure, first-time mom

06:22.203 --> 06:24.904
who panics every time
her child has a slight fever.

06:24.906 --> 06:27.506
Did I just hear you admit
that you're insecure?

06:27.508 --> 06:29.842
The girl who double-majored
in Physics and Chemistry

06:29.844 --> 06:31.844
because the Dean told her
they were the two toughest?

06:31.846 --> 06:34.047
Mom guilt ruins us all. You'll see.

06:34.049 --> 06:35.714
Whenever you decide
to give up the motorcycle

06:35.716 --> 06:36.749
and settle down.

06:36.751 --> 06:37.983
No way.

06:37.985 --> 06:39.985
My kid's going to kindergarten
on the back of a Ducati.

06:41.756 --> 06:43.522
I'm sorry. I need to go
check on another patient.

06:43.524 --> 06:45.847
Oh, how long will she need to stay here?

06:46.327 --> 06:48.461
I'm still not sure
what caused the bleeding.

06:48.463 --> 06:52.898
I didn't see any signs of an
aneurysm or AVM, so that's good.

06:52.900 --> 06:55.468
I'll have a better idea when
I get the post-op test results

06:55.470 --> 06:57.169
back from Pathology.

07:00.340 --> 07:01.574
Thank you.

07:04.978 --> 07:07.146
This is why I love Pathology.

07:07.148 --> 07:09.148
We don't just fix stuff.

07:09.150 --> 07:11.348
We figure out how it got broken

07:11.373 --> 07:12.585
and why.

07:12.587 --> 07:14.220
Good morning.

07:14.222 --> 07:16.355
Just checking to make sure
you got my clot specimen

07:16.357 --> 07:18.057
- and blood draws.
- Just logged them in.

07:18.059 --> 07:21.393
Great. And if there's any way
to expedite, I'd appreciate it.

07:21.395 --> 07:25.131
The mom's a friend of mine
and stressed to the max.

07:25.133 --> 07:26.676
I'm pretty sure the bleed was caused...

07:26.701 --> 07:28.234
Stop.

07:28.236 --> 07:31.937
I'm sorry. I meant... please stop.

07:31.939 --> 07:33.873
I'd rather not know what you think.

07:33.875 --> 07:36.742
It causes confirmation bias.

07:36.744 --> 07:38.177
Copy that.

07:40.748 --> 07:43.115
Hey. Um...

07:43.117 --> 07:46.241
Did I see you on Hanover Street
this morning?

07:46.754 --> 07:49.622
I... don't know.

07:51.091 --> 07:54.126
Were you on Hanover Street this morning?

07:54.128 --> 07:56.061
Yes.

07:56.063 --> 07:58.920
I walked to work.

07:59.834 --> 08:03.736
Did you... see anything interesting...

08:03.738 --> 08:05.135
on the walk?

08:07.240 --> 08:09.055
Hmm...

08:10.778 --> 08:11.810
S-Shaun?

08:14.080 --> 08:15.814
We can't both expedite your results

08:15.816 --> 08:17.983
and reminisce about our morning walks.

08:17.985 --> 08:19.818
Sorry. Carry on.

08:24.292 --> 08:26.192
You're totally freaking out, aren't you?

08:26.194 --> 08:28.527
No, I'm not freaking out.

08:28.529 --> 08:29.762
All my patients freak out

08:29.764 --> 08:31.330
waiting for their final test results.

08:31.332 --> 08:34.099
For 48 hours, you don't know
if you've won the lottery

08:34.101 --> 08:37.001
or... if you're gonna be dead
in a few months.

08:37.004 --> 08:38.270
Hell, I freak out, too.

08:38.272 --> 08:39.804
It's the only time I feel helpless.

08:39.807 --> 08:40.940
The treatment's over.

08:40.942 --> 08:43.275
There's nothing left to do but... wait.

08:43.277 --> 08:45.244
I'm a little stressed.

08:45.246 --> 08:47.279
That speech... not helpful.

08:47.281 --> 08:50.316
My advice. Embrace it.

08:50.318 --> 08:51.584
You're experiencing emotions

08:51.586 --> 08:53.986
only a few people on Earth
will ever understand.

08:53.988 --> 08:56.555
The kind Hemingway wrote about.

08:56.557 --> 08:58.518
- I'm more of a Faulkner guy.
- You would be.

08:58.520 --> 09:01.093
- You don't like Faulkner?
- No, I don't like Faulkner.

09:01.095 --> 09:02.628
Nobody really likes Faulkner.

09:02.630 --> 09:03.902
I like Faulkner.

09:05.131 --> 09:06.738
Right.

09:09.971 --> 09:11.409
Anyway...

09:11.872 --> 09:14.079
if there's anything you need from me,

09:14.475 --> 09:16.642
even if it's just to talk,

09:16.644 --> 09:18.277
you have my direct number.

09:18.279 --> 09:19.712
Do not hesitate to use it.

09:22.450 --> 09:24.381
I appreciate that.

09:25.686 --> 09:30.422
And I would like to show my gratitude.

09:30.424 --> 09:31.957
I know I haven't been

09:31.959 --> 09:33.392
the easiest patient to deal with.

09:33.394 --> 09:35.461
That's not necessary.

09:35.463 --> 09:37.062
I mean, if you want,

09:37.064 --> 09:38.430
you can make a donation
to cancer research.

09:38.432 --> 09:39.732
I already donate.

09:39.734 --> 09:42.001
I wanted to thank <i>you,</i>
<i>not society at large.</i>

09:42.003 --> 09:46.038
How about... Have you ever tried
Macallan's Sherry Oak 25?

09:46.040 --> 09:47.306
I don't drink.

09:47.308 --> 09:48.841
And I just said it's not necessary.

09:48.843 --> 09:51.377
How about a weekend in Ojai?
I hear the spa is amazing.

09:51.379 --> 09:53.812
- No means no.
- I'm not trying to molest you.

09:53.814 --> 09:55.247
I just want to thank you.

09:55.249 --> 09:57.116
And you have, and you are very welcome.

09:57.118 --> 09:58.417
Why do you have to control
every little thing?

09:58.419 --> 10:00.686
I have pepper spray in my purse.
Don't make me use it.

10:09.563 --> 10:12.598
Carly, I am gonna need 60 units

10:12.600 --> 10:14.533
of type B-positive packed red blood cells

10:14.535 --> 10:15.734
held for O.R.

10:15.736 --> 10:16.869
- 60?
- Mm-hmm.

10:16.871 --> 10:19.004
You operating on a hemophiliac elephant?

10:19.006 --> 10:22.541
Our patient has a 200-pound neurofibroma.

10:22.543 --> 10:23.842
Cool.

10:23.844 --> 10:25.744
There's more blood in the tumor
than the patient,

10:25.746 --> 10:29.181
so we're gonna have to follow
Massive Transfusion Protocol.

10:29.183 --> 10:30.349
You...

10:32.253 --> 10:35.854
You might need antifibrinolytic agents

10:35.856 --> 10:37.996
to control the bleeding.

10:38.426 --> 10:40.726
That's a good idea. Thanks.

10:40.728 --> 10:45.130
I could do some research
on cell salvage techniques.

10:45.132 --> 10:46.832
Cancer is a risk, but if we were...

10:46.834 --> 10:48.767
I'm sorry, Shaun.

10:48.769 --> 10:53.205
Melendez has put together
a pretty big team, so...

10:53.207 --> 10:55.107
we have everything we need.

11:03.417 --> 11:05.818
I talked to Murphy. He definitely saw us.

11:05.820 --> 11:06.952
What'd he say?

11:06.954 --> 11:08.354
It's not what he said. It's how he acted.

11:08.356 --> 11:10.856
He was clearly uncomfortable
talking to me.

11:10.858 --> 11:13.359
He's uncomfortable talking to <i>everyone.</i>

11:13.361 --> 11:14.693
We need to get out in front of this.

11:14.695 --> 11:16.428
Tell Andrews before someone else does.

11:16.430 --> 11:18.697
We need to figure out
exactly what Murphy saw.

11:18.699 --> 11:21.834
How? We can't just ask him
if he saw us making...

11:21.836 --> 11:23.202
bread.

11:23.204 --> 11:25.404
We're not gonna get anywhere
with indirect questions.

11:25.406 --> 11:27.005
I'll talk to him.

11:27.007 --> 11:28.874
You think you can read him
better than I can?

11:28.876 --> 11:31.477
No, but if at first you don't succeed...

11:31.479 --> 11:33.178
Let the man try?

11:34.514 --> 11:36.348
Dr. Han wants to see you two.

11:36.350 --> 11:38.250
- Both of us?
- Yep.

11:38.252 --> 11:39.418
Yep.

11:51.691 --> 11:53.024
Have a seat.

11:56.069 --> 11:58.785
Actually, we've been meaning
to talk to you.

11:59.540 --> 12:02.541
- The issue is...
- Dr. Han met with the medical board.

12:02.543 --> 12:05.778
We're not going to be suspended
or reprimanded.

12:05.780 --> 12:07.613
The hospital will pay fines
on your behalf,

12:07.615 --> 12:08.680
and you'll need to complete

12:08.682 --> 12:10.582
a few continuing education classes.

12:10.584 --> 12:13.091
But overall, not bad.

12:13.554 --> 12:15.154
Thank you.

12:15.156 --> 12:17.189
Yeah, thanks.

12:17.191 --> 12:19.758
Does this mean I'm back
on the surgical team?

12:19.760 --> 12:21.827
No. It does not.

12:21.829 --> 12:24.363
You convinced the Board
that he's competent.

12:26.466 --> 12:27.699
You're welcome.

12:42.750 --> 12:46.585
We got a big problem.
With our tiny patient.

12:46.587 --> 12:49.388
I did a repeat assessment
of the pre-op CT's

12:49.390 --> 12:52.090
and found a trace subarachnoid bleed.

12:52.092 --> 12:54.493
But there was no bruise on her scalp.

12:54.495 --> 12:55.727
I know.

12:55.729 --> 12:57.396
The only way she could get this injury

12:57.398 --> 12:58.964
is if someone shook her,

12:58.966 --> 13:00.866
and they would have to shake her hard.

13:03.102 --> 13:05.871
S-Someone abused her.

13:11.828 --> 13:13.329
No.

13:13.331 --> 13:14.463
I've known Laura since high school.

13:14.465 --> 13:15.698
She's the most composed,

13:15.700 --> 13:17.399
even-tempered person I've ever met.

13:17.401 --> 13:19.468
And she's totally devoted to that baby.

13:19.470 --> 13:20.502
What about the father?

13:20.504 --> 13:21.971
She conceived via a donor.

13:21.973 --> 13:23.639
A nanny, a relative,

13:23.641 --> 13:25.674
a-a boyfriend who's been helping out?

13:25.676 --> 13:27.443
She waited so long for this...

13:27.445 --> 13:29.712
wanted to do everything herself.

13:29.714 --> 13:31.669
Then it has to be her.

13:32.316 --> 13:34.049
We need to call
Child Protective Services.

13:34.051 --> 13:35.089
No.

13:36.220 --> 13:37.686
Not yet.

13:37.688 --> 13:39.221
I'm gonna do an MRI

13:39.223 --> 13:42.324
to rule out benign enlargement
of the extra-axial space.

13:42.326 --> 13:45.027
- Before we ruin her life...
- Good idea.

13:45.029 --> 13:48.464
Except for the part
about <i>you</i> doing the test.

13:48.466 --> 13:50.065
She's your friend.

13:50.067 --> 13:51.866
You think I'd try to help
someone cover up child abuse?

13:51.868 --> 13:53.068
I don't know you well enough

13:53.070 --> 13:54.203
to know what you would or wouldn't do

13:54.205 --> 13:55.735
to protect a friend.

13:56.340 --> 13:58.941
I could do the MRI.

13:58.943 --> 14:00.576
I'm not the mother's friend.

14:00.578 --> 14:02.578
But you are a pathologist.

14:02.580 --> 14:04.702
Giving MRI's is not your job.

14:06.516 --> 14:08.484
Page Farmer. Have him do it.

14:08.486 --> 14:09.818
On it.

14:19.830 --> 14:21.130
Murphy.

14:21.132 --> 14:22.364
We need to talk.

14:28.738 --> 14:30.506
I don't have a girlfriend.

14:32.709 --> 14:34.565
Okay.

14:34.912 --> 14:39.648
Is that consistent with what
you've deduced and seen

14:39.650 --> 14:40.849
regarding my life?

14:42.686 --> 14:44.053
Yesss?

14:45.889 --> 14:47.122
Good.

14:49.492 --> 14:50.826
Enjoy your apple.

15:04.909 --> 15:06.208
It's not fair.

15:06.210 --> 15:07.643
Shaun is being punished for mistakes

15:07.645 --> 15:09.945
that Han thinks
he <i>might</i> make in the future.

15:09.947 --> 15:11.747
He's not punishing him.

15:11.749 --> 15:13.415
He just saved his ass.

15:13.417 --> 15:15.617
Okay, Kenny. The MRA's gonna help us map

15:15.619 --> 15:16.986
the blood supply to the tumor.

15:16.988 --> 15:18.420
If you could just lie still.

15:18.422 --> 15:19.755
No talking until we're done.

15:19.757 --> 15:21.423
Sure, no problem.

15:21.425 --> 15:23.025
We should take a stand.

15:23.027 --> 15:25.260
- Meaning what?
- Stage a walkout?

15:25.262 --> 15:28.297
How much does one of these
bad boys cost, anyway?

15:28.299 --> 15:29.565
About $3 million.

15:29.567 --> 15:32.134
But it's worthless
unless you stop talking.

15:32.136 --> 15:34.203
Sorry. My bad.

15:34.205 --> 15:36.338
Us getting fired is not gonna do
anything to help Shaun.

15:36.340 --> 15:38.671
And I'm not even sure
we should be helping him.

15:39.243 --> 15:40.342
Did you ever stop to think

15:40.344 --> 15:42.644
that maybe Han knows what he's doing?

15:42.646 --> 15:44.179
Shaun has made mistakes,

15:44.181 --> 15:46.682
but he has three more years of residency.

15:46.684 --> 15:49.318
That is plenty of time to improve.

15:49.320 --> 15:51.720
Yes, you can build a winning team

15:51.722 --> 15:53.255
through supportive training,

15:53.257 --> 15:55.457
but you can also do it
by recruiting the best

15:55.459 --> 15:57.192
and pushing them. Relentlessly.

15:57.194 --> 16:00.429
No feelings. No charity. No loyalty.

16:00.431 --> 16:02.131
Those who thrive and get better

16:02.133 --> 16:03.632
than they ever thought
they could, you keep...

16:03.634 --> 16:06.201
...and those who don't, you cut.

16:06.203 --> 16:07.341
That's not good.

16:07.366 --> 16:09.138
It works for Jeff Bezos
and Bill Belichick.

16:09.140 --> 16:10.672
I'm not talking about
your leadership lecture.

16:10.674 --> 16:12.007
I'm talking about this.

16:14.177 --> 16:16.167
We need to page Melendez.

16:17.314 --> 16:20.115
What are you talking about? You know me!

16:20.117 --> 16:22.484
How could you possibly believe
I could hurt my baby?

16:22.486 --> 16:25.954
I don't. Which is why I ordered
the additional tests.

16:25.956 --> 16:29.458
But did you never leave her
with anyone else?

16:29.460 --> 16:32.261
Even for just a few minutes
so that you could take a nap?

16:32.263 --> 16:34.060
Or a bath?

16:34.632 --> 16:37.399
Taking care of a newborn.
It's... It's exhausting.

16:37.401 --> 16:39.768
No. It isn't.

16:39.770 --> 16:41.570
After waiting for so long,

16:41.572 --> 16:44.320
every single moment,
no matter how hard...

16:45.576 --> 16:47.281
It's not exhausting.

16:48.079 --> 16:49.511
It's a joy.

16:53.717 --> 16:57.083
Laura, I know you love her...

16:57.822 --> 17:00.122
but you're still human.

17:00.124 --> 17:01.924
You must get tired sometimes.

17:01.926 --> 17:03.826
I don't! Really.

17:03.828 --> 17:05.761
You don't understand because you...

17:05.762 --> 17:07.762
because you haven't experienced it.

17:07.765 --> 17:10.098
But when you love someone so much...

17:12.335 --> 17:14.002
The tests.

17:14.003 --> 17:16.137
They have to be wrong.

17:19.188 --> 17:22.377
We expected the tumor to grow
since the last scans,

17:22.378 --> 17:24.359
but not to this extent.

17:24.682 --> 17:25.747
Blood vessels that I thought

17:25.749 --> 17:27.281
we'd be able to quickly cauterize

17:27.284 --> 17:29.282
are now thicker than my thumb.

17:29.820 --> 17:31.420
It's impossible to remove the tumor

17:31.422 --> 17:33.322
without causing you to bleed to death.

17:36.392 --> 17:37.659
No.

17:39.429 --> 17:41.063
I don't care how risky it is.

17:42.732 --> 17:45.000
I'd rather die in surgery
than continue to live

17:45.002 --> 17:47.936
with this huge, damn tick

17:47.938 --> 17:49.138
sucking the life out of me.

17:49.140 --> 17:52.374
Kenny, as long as your heart
remains healthy,

17:52.376 --> 17:54.598
you basically will be, too.

17:55.279 --> 17:57.513
And we can do a better job
treating the pain.

17:57.893 --> 18:00.313
I don't want to be treated.

18:00.818 --> 18:02.818
I want to be cured.

18:02.820 --> 18:04.753
I want my life back.

18:06.022 --> 18:07.923
I always thought all...

18:07.925 --> 18:10.192
all I had to do was get enough money,

18:10.194 --> 18:12.158
or find the right doctors...

18:13.097 --> 18:15.230
But if you're telling me
there's no hope...

18:24.108 --> 18:26.380
I appreciate everything y'all done.

18:27.411 --> 18:29.545
Or at least tried to do.

18:41.928 --> 18:44.563
The injuries from shaking a baby
are much different

18:44.565 --> 18:46.231
than from blunt force trauma.

18:46.233 --> 18:49.167
Oh, that's awful... but also interesting.

18:49.169 --> 18:51.803
It's like you're a detective
in a murder mystery.

18:51.805 --> 18:53.972
Only, thank God, the baby's not dead.

18:53.974 --> 18:56.975
That's exactly what Carly said.

18:56.977 --> 19:00.078
She likes solving medical mysteries.

19:00.080 --> 19:03.248
She's very smart. And aggressive.

19:03.250 --> 19:05.951
Well, how do she treat you? Is she nice?

19:05.953 --> 19:08.820
Yes, she's very nice.

19:08.822 --> 19:11.022
She wants me to stay in her department.

19:11.024 --> 19:13.425
She thinks we make a good team.

19:13.427 --> 19:16.228
So it sounds like you have
a case you're interested in

19:16.230 --> 19:19.308
and a coworker you like
who's nice to you.

19:19.733 --> 19:22.728
Maybe Pathology won't be
that bad after all.

19:27.474 --> 19:29.174
I have work to do.

19:35.816 --> 19:37.516
Since it seems we're gonna be
working together

19:37.518 --> 19:39.518
for a while longer...

19:39.520 --> 19:42.254
maybe it is time
we came out of the closet.

19:42.256 --> 19:43.388
Maybe?

19:43.390 --> 19:45.457
Are you saying you want to?

19:45.459 --> 19:46.958
Do you want to?

19:46.960 --> 19:48.827
Maybe.

19:48.829 --> 19:51.129
You're afraid it would
make things awkward?

19:51.131 --> 19:52.797
People seeing us as a couple?

19:52.799 --> 19:54.966
Yes, obviously.

19:54.968 --> 19:56.601
But at the moment, I'm more afraid

19:56.603 --> 19:58.336
that we wouldn't
be having this conversation

19:58.338 --> 20:00.324
if Murphy hadn't almost busted us.

20:01.341 --> 20:04.743
Which makes me think we're not
ready to have this conversation.

20:08.481 --> 20:10.609
It's understandable if we aren't.

20:11.118 --> 20:12.551
We've both been in relationships

20:12.553 --> 20:13.852
we thought were gonna last...

20:16.203 --> 20:19.724
Yeah. Understandable,
but why should we even care

20:19.726 --> 20:21.526
what people at work think?

20:23.864 --> 20:26.464
So, should we talk to Andrews?

20:30.102 --> 20:32.590
Maybe. What do you think?

20:34.341 --> 20:35.974
Maybe.

20:39.913 --> 20:41.640
Uh, Sawchuck?

20:42.382 --> 20:44.483
- Sorry for the wait.
- Oh. Thank you.

20:44.585 --> 20:46.585
Excuse me, duck curry and rice?

20:46.587 --> 20:47.986
40 minutes? Really?

20:47.988 --> 20:49.788
Sorry, the kitchen fell a bit behind.

20:49.790 --> 20:51.323
- It shouldn't be much longer.
- You're not just behind.

20:51.325 --> 20:52.824
People have come in after me,

20:52.826 --> 20:55.393
they've gotten their food,
gone home, eaten.

20:55.395 --> 20:57.128
They're in their PJs, watching a movie.

20:57.130 --> 20:59.698
I'm so sorry. I'll check right now.

20:59.700 --> 21:02.234
- Duck curry.
- Here you go, sir.

21:02.236 --> 21:04.135
Duck curry, brown rice.

21:04.137 --> 21:06.871
- White rice.
- Um, excuse me.

21:06.873 --> 21:08.473
- Duck curry with brown rice?
- Yes.

21:08.475 --> 21:10.842
- Connelly?
- That's me. Thank you.

21:10.844 --> 21:12.477
What are you guys doing back there?

21:12.479 --> 21:13.778
I'm so sorry, Sir.

21:13.780 --> 21:15.347
You know what? I'm tired of sorry.

21:15.349 --> 21:16.848
I just... I want my food!

21:16.850 --> 21:18.416
I'm sorry. It should just be
another minute.

21:18.418 --> 21:20.452
I don't want to wait any longer!

21:23.257 --> 21:24.823
I'm sorry.

21:24.825 --> 21:25.991
Sorry. I'm sorry.

21:25.993 --> 21:27.158
I didn't... I didn't mean to yell.

21:27.160 --> 21:28.627
I'm so sorry.

21:28.629 --> 21:32.831
Carry on. Carry on. Enjoy your...

21:37.070 --> 21:39.771
She's always trying to one-up us.

21:39.773 --> 21:41.039
Morgan.

21:41.041 --> 21:42.974
She's not staying late because
she wants to do research.

21:42.976 --> 21:45.744
She's staying late so that Han
can <i>see</i> she's staying late.

21:45.746 --> 21:47.812
It's just who she is.
Don't take it personal.

21:47.814 --> 21:49.124
Mm.

21:49.750 --> 21:51.916
My dad's a Taekwondo grandmaster.

21:51.918 --> 21:53.318
Coached me growing up.

21:53.320 --> 21:55.887
He always used to say,
"Only you can beat you."

21:55.889 --> 21:57.856
Well, my mom's a lounge singer,
and she used to say,

21:57.858 --> 21:59.291
"Upstage me and I'll beat your ass."

21:59.293 --> 22:00.792
You'd think if you're selling boba,

22:00.794 --> 22:01.993
you'd have straws wide enough

22:01.995 --> 22:03.361
to get the balls through the damn thing.

22:03.363 --> 22:04.796
I can't believe you drink that stuff.

22:04.798 --> 22:07.866
It's like putting gummy bears in a drink.

22:10.771 --> 22:12.070
You give up?

22:12.072 --> 22:13.338
Want a soda instead?

22:17.744 --> 22:19.611
I see you.

22:19.613 --> 22:22.533
Which is, I assume,
your primary objective.

22:23.550 --> 22:26.451
I didn't even know you were still here.

22:26.453 --> 22:28.253
I've been reading
the latest journal articles

22:28.255 --> 22:30.989
- on neurofibroma...
- Go home.

22:30.991 --> 22:33.258
There's nothing you can do
for Kenny Grimm.

22:33.260 --> 22:35.293
And you're gonna have
other patients tomorrow.

22:38.664 --> 22:41.166
I got an idea.

22:41.168 --> 22:43.773
If we embolize the larger
blood vessels to the tumor

22:43.775 --> 22:44.836
before surgery,

22:44.838 --> 22:46.538
we can use your body's clotting factor

22:46.540 --> 22:48.039
to help clog them.

22:48.041 --> 22:50.108
This should reduce
hemorrhaging during surgery

22:50.110 --> 22:53.605
and allow us to excise the tumor
without you bleeding out.

22:53.947 --> 22:56.715
We'll steer a catheter through
an artery in your thigh...

22:56.717 --> 22:58.316
- Yes.
- Kenny...

22:58.318 --> 22:59.984
maybe you should let them finish.

22:59.986 --> 23:03.021
No, I shouldn't.

23:03.023 --> 23:04.556
And, yes, you should.

23:04.558 --> 23:07.392
Yes, yes, yes. As soon as possible. Yes.

23:10.029 --> 23:11.196
Thank you.

23:17.336 --> 23:18.570
The tests came back.

23:18.572 --> 23:20.105
They confirm the previous results.

23:20.107 --> 23:22.774
Well, they're wrong.
There must be some other...

23:22.776 --> 23:25.243
There has to be another test! Please.

23:25.245 --> 23:26.611
Ma'am, you're gonna need to come with us.

23:26.613 --> 23:28.380
- You need help.
- From <i>you!</i>

23:28.382 --> 23:30.515
You're my friend,
and you called the police?!

23:30.517 --> 23:32.217
Well, someone hurt your baby.
If it wasn't you...

23:32.219 --> 23:34.319
No one hurt my baby! You're wrong!

23:34.321 --> 23:35.887
How can you not believe me?!

23:42.172 --> 23:44.389
Just need to get a few more
branches off the aorta

23:44.391 --> 23:45.699
and we're done.

23:49.543 --> 23:51.275
Well done, Dr. Browne.

23:56.383 --> 23:57.416
What's the fluid status?

23:57.418 --> 23:59.051
CVP is 14 and rising.

23:59.053 --> 24:01.320
Get diuretics on deck.
40 milligrams I.V. Lasix.

24:01.322 --> 24:03.155
Careful. If his pressure goes too low,

24:03.157 --> 24:04.556
his kidneys won't perfuse.

24:04.558 --> 24:06.892
I need you to keep his CVP
between 8 and 12.

24:06.894 --> 24:08.560
He can't tolerate much more of this.

24:08.562 --> 24:09.962
We need to get him to an O.R.

24:09.964 --> 24:12.631
Embolizing his vessels caused
third spacing of fluids

24:12.633 --> 24:14.166
to the body and lungs.

24:14.168 --> 24:15.300
We saved the operation,

24:15.302 --> 24:17.235
but now we only have half the time do it.

24:20.369 --> 24:22.274
Hey.

24:22.276 --> 24:23.308
Any word?

24:23.310 --> 24:24.409
No, not yet.

24:24.411 --> 24:27.045
Well, I-isn't there someone
from Radiology

24:27.047 --> 24:29.348
who can expedite,
someone who owes you a favor?

24:29.350 --> 24:32.884
Even if there was,
I would not waste it on you

24:32.886 --> 24:34.920
because <i>you</i> do not need it.

24:38.492 --> 24:41.026
You are one of the most willful
patients I've ever had,

24:41.028 --> 24:43.395
and the finish line is in sight.

24:43.397 --> 24:46.260
All you need to do
is just run through the tape.

24:47.034 --> 24:49.835
Look, if it helps, as soon as
I'm done with this patient,

24:49.837 --> 24:51.236
we can talk some more.

24:51.238 --> 24:53.071
I can write you a script

24:53.073 --> 24:54.706
for something to help you
with the anxiety,

24:54.708 --> 24:56.241
but I don't think you need it.

24:56.243 --> 24:57.642
You got this.

25:03.751 --> 25:05.817
- More suction.
- Me, too.

25:05.819 --> 25:07.252
More sponges.

25:12.192 --> 25:13.558
Retract.

25:15.695 --> 25:17.165
That's it.

25:17.531 --> 25:19.398
What's his estimated blood loss?

25:19.400 --> 25:21.666
About 8 1/2 liters.

25:21.668 --> 25:23.802
The entire human body

25:23.804 --> 25:27.384
typically only has 5 1/2 liters of blood.

25:27.841 --> 25:30.142
Yeah, I know.

25:30.144 --> 25:32.110
Let's get 30 more units on deck of PRBC.

25:33.447 --> 25:35.847
Add cryo, fresh frozen plasma,
and platelets to that.

25:47.461 --> 25:51.830
We should have checked
for blood breakdown products.

25:51.832 --> 25:53.498
If you don't mind, I'm trying
to pay attention to this.

25:53.500 --> 25:55.233
I wasn't talking to you.

25:55.235 --> 25:57.169
Or about this patient.

26:01.507 --> 26:05.143
We need to reexamine the
subdural blood clot specimens.

26:05.145 --> 26:07.746
If there's hemosiderin
deposition and chronic membranes

26:07.748 --> 26:09.114
including fibrous wall,

26:09.116 --> 26:11.817
it could prove it was not abuse.

26:11.819 --> 26:13.118
What else could it be?

26:13.120 --> 26:15.153
The tests proved non-accidental trauma.

26:15.155 --> 26:17.622
Yes. The tests were right.

26:22.963 --> 26:25.297
Resected portion is secure.

26:25.299 --> 26:26.765
I.V.'s and central line?

26:26.767 --> 26:28.066
- Secure.
- Secure.

26:28.068 --> 26:29.468
Okay, everybody, get in position.

26:29.470 --> 26:31.470
Let's flip this pancake.

26:31.472 --> 26:32.737
On three.

26:32.739 --> 26:36.174
One, two, three.

26:37.611 --> 26:39.411
Wait. His heart rate spiked.

26:39.413 --> 26:40.512
Lay him back down.

26:40.514 --> 26:42.814
Softly. Softly.

26:44.818 --> 26:46.985
We okay?

26:46.987 --> 26:48.420
Yeah. Just a blip.

26:48.422 --> 26:49.621
Once more with feeling.

26:49.623 --> 26:53.492
Ready? One, two, three.

26:57.731 --> 26:59.865
- How are we doing?
- Good. He's stable.

26:59.867 --> 27:01.900
All right, swab the posterior
incision site.

27:01.902 --> 27:04.069
Okay, scalpel and sponge on a stick.

27:04.071 --> 27:05.937
He's crashing.

27:05.939 --> 27:07.139
He's ventilating fine.

27:07.141 --> 27:08.907
We've got no immediate
blood loss or hemorrhaging.

27:08.909 --> 27:10.375
It looks like distributive shock.

27:10.377 --> 27:12.878
I need stat labs and
initiate shock resuscitation.

27:16.284 --> 27:18.651
He's got a high white count
and what looks to be

27:18.653 --> 27:20.614
a systemic pro-inflammatory
cytokine release.

27:20.639 --> 27:21.972
Cutting off the blood supply to the tumor

27:21.974 --> 27:23.106
is causing post embolization syndrome.

27:23.108 --> 27:24.541
I need intra-arterial lidocaine,

27:24.543 --> 27:26.176
130 milligrams of methylprednisolone,

27:26.178 --> 27:27.444
and start antibiotics.

27:27.446 --> 27:29.079
Should we be trying
to reverse the embolization?

27:29.081 --> 27:30.447
Restore blood flow to the tumor?

27:30.449 --> 27:31.748
Well, then, we'd risk him
bleeding out even faster.

27:31.750 --> 27:33.083
We need to abort.

27:33.085 --> 27:34.785
Cut off what we already excised
and leave the rest.

27:34.787 --> 27:37.131
- No. We can't give up.
- We're not giving up.

27:37.133 --> 27:38.438
We're stopping a futile procedure

27:38.440 --> 27:39.523
to save the patient.

27:41.327 --> 27:43.860
We need to get Murphy in here.
It's a blood flow problem.

27:43.862 --> 27:46.530
Murphy has a special talent
for visualizing complex anatomy.

27:46.532 --> 27:48.817
We don't have time.
We need to stop the P.E.S. now.

27:48.819 --> 27:51.242
- Page Dr. Murphy.
- No. Do not page Dr. Murphy.

27:51.267 --> 27:52.299
I get it. You like him.

27:52.301 --> 27:53.600
But we don't have time for an audition.

27:53.602 --> 27:54.968
I'm trying to save my patient's life.

27:54.970 --> 27:56.704
<i>My</i> patient. Which means it's <i>my</i> call.

27:56.706 --> 27:58.672
I am also trying to save
your patient's life,

27:58.674 --> 28:00.541
so I'm urging you to stop wasting time.

28:00.543 --> 28:01.909
Now we've cut away almost half.

28:01.911 --> 28:03.110
That's all we can do right now.

28:03.112 --> 28:04.578
So let's remove it and give him a chance

28:04.580 --> 28:06.413
to live and fight another day.

28:09.151 --> 28:10.684
The breakdown products show

28:10.686 --> 28:12.319
the injury that caused the hematoma

28:12.321 --> 28:14.988
happened at least seven weeks ago.

28:14.990 --> 28:16.824
When was she born?

28:16.826 --> 28:19.389
A little over seven weeks ago.

28:20.262 --> 28:22.996
But the vacuum delivery
must've caused a subdural bleed

28:22.998 --> 28:24.965
which re-bled two days ago.

28:24.967 --> 28:27.968
The baby wasn't abused.

28:32.975 --> 28:35.542
Shaun, we need you in the O.R.

28:49.325 --> 28:51.759
Any thoughts, Dr. Murphy?

28:53.963 --> 28:56.830
You don't have enough time.

28:56.832 --> 28:59.399
You can't fully map
the circulatory system

28:59.401 --> 29:01.602
and remove the tumor
without killing the patient.

29:01.604 --> 29:02.936
It's too complex.

29:06.275 --> 29:08.809
Well, at least he was brief
and to the point.

29:08.811 --> 29:09.943
Now, can we do what I...

29:09.945 --> 29:11.879
But you don't have to do it quickly.

29:13.715 --> 29:15.315
We slow down, he bleeds out.

29:15.317 --> 29:16.750
If you clamp the aorta,

29:16.752 --> 29:18.786
it could lower the blood flow
to the tumor enough

29:18.788 --> 29:20.587
to slow the release of the cytokines.

29:20.589 --> 29:21.855
Clamping the aorta

29:21.857 --> 29:24.291
will kill the intestines,
kidneys, and legs.

29:24.293 --> 29:27.294
Not if we release the clamp
every 10 minutes.

29:27.296 --> 29:29.429
Give it just enough blood
to stop the cytokines

29:29.431 --> 29:31.598
but not so much that he bleeds to death.

29:39.942 --> 29:41.388
Let's do it.

29:42.311 --> 29:44.478
Thank you for the consult, Dr. Murphy.

29:46.915 --> 29:48.782
Reposition him to lateral.

29:48.784 --> 29:50.647
Secure I.V. and central line.

29:51.387 --> 29:53.775
- Secure.
- 10 blade.

29:54.557 --> 29:57.257
Starting midline laparotomy.

29:57.259 --> 29:59.155
Debakey.

29:59.829 --> 30:02.162
Opening up the lesser sac.

30:02.164 --> 30:03.797
Vessel loops.

30:07.101 --> 30:08.790
Get a Rumel ready.

30:09.705 --> 30:11.438
I need umbilical tape.

30:23.685 --> 30:27.855
MRI exams show chronic changes
of surgery and radiation,

30:27.857 --> 30:32.526
but no sign of residual tumor detected.

30:32.528 --> 30:33.827
No signs.

30:33.829 --> 30:35.362
None.

30:35.364 --> 30:38.365
Zero. Zippo. Zilch.

30:45.207 --> 30:46.573
Wow.

30:46.575 --> 30:49.109
We'll do another MRI
in six months just to be sure,

30:49.111 --> 30:51.211
but you are in the clear.

30:52.847 --> 30:55.148
This is exactly what we hoped for.

30:55.150 --> 30:56.316
<i>Kinehora.</i>

30:56.318 --> 30:57.351
Tuh, tuh, tuh.

30:57.353 --> 30:59.086
Knock on wood.

31:13.067 --> 31:15.135
- Thank you.
- Oh, you son of a bitch.

31:15.137 --> 31:16.303
I told you.

31:16.305 --> 31:17.537
You told me no.

31:21.409 --> 31:23.377
It's too heavy for diamonds.

31:23.379 --> 31:25.312
Is it a Magic 8 Ball?

31:25.314 --> 31:26.446
Will you just open it?

31:33.421 --> 31:35.622
I don't like baseball.

31:35.624 --> 31:37.291
I do.

31:38.693 --> 31:41.261
So you got me something <i>you</i> like?

31:41.263 --> 31:44.719
I caught that foul ball
down the third base line...

31:45.768 --> 31:47.968
on my 13th birthday.

31:47.970 --> 31:52.105
My dad was amazed that I snagged it.

31:52.107 --> 31:55.742
After the game,
we went outside the stadium.

31:55.744 --> 31:57.878
And I was a shy kid,
but my father pushed me

31:57.880 --> 32:01.403
to ask my favorite players
to sign it, and they all did.

32:02.217 --> 32:04.985
Bert Campaneris, Rollie Fingers,

32:04.987 --> 32:07.087
Reggie Jackson, Catfish Hunter.

32:09.190 --> 32:12.326
If it happened today,
it'd all be on video.

32:12.328 --> 32:15.829
But all I have to remember
that awesome day...

32:15.831 --> 32:17.497
is that ball.

32:21.069 --> 32:22.803
I wanted you to have something

32:22.805 --> 32:24.805
that mattered to me.

32:30.679 --> 32:33.647
- Aaron, I can't.
- Oh, yes, you can.

32:42.858 --> 32:43.991
Bye.

32:47.229 --> 32:49.200
Cancer changes people.

32:49.798 --> 32:52.799
I've had patients tell me
it was a blessing.

32:52.801 --> 32:55.135
That their lives were better after.

32:55.137 --> 32:56.624
They're idiots.

32:57.373 --> 32:58.905
Maybe.

33:02.878 --> 33:06.246
Would you have thought of such
a wonderful gift 11 months ago?

33:31.703 --> 33:33.303
Care to do the honors?

33:43.315 --> 33:44.848
Let's take it up.

34:29.592 --> 34:30.793
I'm so sorry.

34:33.110 --> 34:34.710
I should've trusted you.

34:39.429 --> 34:41.197
Please talk to me, Laura.

34:41.199 --> 34:43.731
Yell at me if you want. I deserve it.

34:44.569 --> 34:47.193
- It's not your fault.
- Yes, it is.

34:47.672 --> 34:49.505
I should have done more research,

34:49.507 --> 34:52.375
looked harder
for an alternative diagnosis.

34:52.377 --> 34:55.344
I mean it's not your fault
you are the way you are.

34:57.582 --> 35:00.583
You don't understand
the love a mother feels.

35:02.319 --> 35:06.156
I understand that a lot of
mothers abuse their children.

35:06.158 --> 35:08.715
You don't understand love.

35:09.294 --> 35:13.029
Because you've never allowed
yourself to be vulnerable.

35:15.065 --> 35:17.333
Even when you were married to Kashal,

35:17.335 --> 35:20.003
you never really committed.

35:21.672 --> 35:23.973
You always expect the worst in people.

35:25.509 --> 35:27.721
Because that's all you see in yourself.

35:33.952 --> 35:35.618
Okay.

35:41.660 --> 35:44.792
I've never been in so much pain...

35:45.297 --> 35:47.497
but felt so good.

35:47.499 --> 35:49.165
We'll up your pain meds.

35:49.167 --> 35:51.935
You're still gonna need some
skin and soft tissue grafts,

35:51.937 --> 35:53.736
but the hard part's done.

35:53.738 --> 35:56.105
Your prognosis is excellent.

35:56.107 --> 35:58.174
Thank y'all so much.

35:59.744 --> 36:01.144
What am I taking this thing home in?

36:01.146 --> 36:03.613
A glass bottle?
Y'all got something that big?

36:03.615 --> 36:06.182
He's just being a smart ass.

36:11.957 --> 36:13.656
Are you sure you want to do this?

36:13.658 --> 36:14.924
Shut up.

36:34.044 --> 36:36.546
I saved the patient.

36:36.548 --> 36:38.615
I deserve to be a surgeon.

36:40.284 --> 36:41.584
Dr. Murphy...

36:41.586 --> 36:46.562
Dr. Han, I want my old job back.

36:49.760 --> 36:51.427
You're making a mistake.

36:51.429 --> 36:52.662
Am I, Shaun?

36:52.664 --> 36:54.264
Yes.

36:54.266 --> 36:57.367
Because it seems like you're
doing really well in Pathology.

36:57.369 --> 36:59.569
You made a great save on an earlier case

36:59.571 --> 37:01.804
and a great save today.

37:01.806 --> 37:04.674
You keep doing well, and, over time,

37:04.676 --> 37:07.477
we can build to you having
more responsibility.

37:16.620 --> 37:18.054
No.

37:21.892 --> 37:24.060
I'm a surgeon.

37:29.501 --> 37:33.936
I am not leaving your office
until you reinstate me.

37:39.978 --> 37:41.577
What are you doing, Shaun?

37:41.579 --> 37:43.279
Do you think ordering me to do something

37:43.281 --> 37:44.714
will change my mind?

37:44.716 --> 37:47.483
Do you really think it's
a good idea to try and bully me?

37:50.054 --> 37:53.754
I am a surgeon.

37:54.626 --> 37:56.993
I am a surgeon.

37:56.995 --> 38:00.229
Do you realize that
you're proving my point?

38:00.231 --> 38:01.964
That you're acting immature?

38:01.966 --> 38:04.400
Showing that you don't know
how to communicate

38:04.402 --> 38:06.369
and you can't control your emotions?

38:06.371 --> 38:09.939
I am a surgeon!

38:09.941 --> 38:12.523
But you do have a talent that I value.

38:13.678 --> 38:15.545
So I'm gonna give you one last chance

38:15.547 --> 38:17.213
to maintain your dignity

38:17.215 --> 38:21.150
and leave my office... now.

38:23.254 --> 38:25.021
Because if I have to call Security,

38:25.023 --> 38:28.224
you understand that I'm also
gonna have to fire you.

38:34.332 --> 38:38.134
I am a surgeon!

38:38.136 --> 38:41.471
I am a surgeon!

38:41.473 --> 38:44.507
I am... I am a surgeon!!

38:44.509 --> 38:47.977
I am a surgeon, Dr. Han!

38:47.979 --> 38:50.413
I am a surgeon!
