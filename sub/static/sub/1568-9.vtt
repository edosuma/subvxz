WEBVTT

00:01.418 --> 00:02.251
Previously on "The 100"...

00:03.253 --> 00:04.087
Hundreds
of your people

00:04.296 --> 00:05.213
are trapped inside
Mount Weather.

00:05.422 --> 00:06.589
Their blood is used
as medicine.

00:06.799 --> 00:08.049
My people are
prisoners there, too.

00:08.258 --> 00:09.842
Why are you
showing us this?

00:10.052 --> 00:10.969
Because I'm afraid.

00:11.178 --> 00:11.970
Of what?

00:12.179 --> 00:13.221
That you're next.

00:13.430 --> 00:14.472
Harper didn't show
up for breakfast.

00:14.682 --> 00:16.140
You guys seen her?

00:16.350 --> 00:17.517
The only way to save
both our people

00:17.726 --> 00:18.685
is if we join together.

00:18.894 --> 00:19.978
I'm in love
with you.

00:20.187 --> 00:21.479
Everything I've done,
all that matters

00:21.689 --> 00:22.814
is that you're OK.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.774
Deliver me the one
you call Finn.

00:24.984 --> 00:28.486
Our truce begins
with his death.

00:28.696 --> 00:30.655
No. Finn!

00:30.864 --> 00:31.990
What will
they do to him?

00:32.199 --> 00:34.283
Finn took 18 lives.

00:34.493 --> 00:36.744
He will suffer the pain
of 18 deaths.

00:38.288 --> 00:42.083
I love you, too.

00:42.292 --> 00:43.501
You're gonna be OK.

00:43.711 --> 00:44.711
Thanks,
princess.

00:49.591 --> 00:50.883
No!

01:36.388 --> 01:38.723
Let me.

01:40.184 --> 01:41.851
They would've
tortured him.

01:42.061 --> 01:43.978
I had to. I--

01:44.188 --> 01:47.273
it's OK. It's OK.

01:47.483 --> 01:50.109
I had to.
It's OK.

01:50.319 --> 01:52.487
What did I do?

01:59.495 --> 02:01.913
The commander
is ready to talk.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.582
Mm-hmm.

02:21.475 --> 02:25.686
Blood has
answered blood.

02:25.896 --> 02:28.356
Some on my side say
that's not enough.

02:28.565 --> 02:29.857
They wanted
the murderer to suffer

02:30.067 --> 02:32.401
as our tradition
demands,

02:32.611 --> 02:34.445
but they do not know
that your suffering

02:34.655 --> 02:36.614
will be worse.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.241
What you did tonight
will haunt you

02:38.450 --> 02:41.536
until the end
of your days.

02:41.745 --> 02:43.788
Still, there will
be restitution.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.707
The body will be given
to the people of Tondc,

02:46.917 --> 02:49.544
murderer and murder
joined by fire.

02:49.753 --> 02:51.587
Only then
can we have peace.

02:51.797 --> 02:53.506
No. No.
We've done enough.

02:53.715 --> 02:55.216
The boy should be buried
by his own people.

02:55.425 --> 02:58.136
Enough? We were owed
the pain of 18 deaths.

02:58.345 --> 03:00.054
We were owed
our righteous kill.

03:00.264 --> 03:02.056
My village
deserves justice.

03:02.266 --> 03:04.517
You don't want justice.
You want vengeance.

03:04.726 --> 03:06.644
You have not seen
my vengeance.

03:06.854 --> 03:09.147
We'll do it...

03:09.356 --> 03:11.524
But when it's over,
we talk about how

03:11.733 --> 03:13.901
to get our people
out of Mount Weather,

03:14.111 --> 03:15.153
all of our people.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.155
We want the same
things, Clarke.

03:17.364 --> 03:19.782
Good.
When do we leave?

03:19.992 --> 03:22.034
Now.

03:23.829 --> 03:25.746
Choose your
attendants.

03:30.377 --> 03:33.379
Clarke, you don't
have to do this.

03:33.589 --> 03:35.423
Yes, I do.

03:35.674 --> 03:38.009
If this truce
doesn't hold,

03:38.218 --> 03:41.387
I killed Finn
for nothing.

03:47.144 --> 03:51.647
Clarke is right.
We need to do this.

03:51.857 --> 03:52.940
Peace with
the grounders

03:53.150 --> 03:54.400
is the only way
we'll survive.

03:54.610 --> 03:55.776
Oh, I don't think
they know what peace is.

03:55.986 --> 03:56.944
The commander does.

03:57.154 --> 03:58.654
She's a child.

03:58.864 --> 04:01.157
They're being led
by a child.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.911
So are we.

04:18.592 --> 04:21.219
Go away.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.012
Raven, I'm sorry.

04:23.222 --> 04:25.348
I said, go away!

04:25.557 --> 04:27.183
I know how hard
this must be for you,

04:27.392 --> 04:28.935
but I'm leaving
with the grounders,

04:29.144 --> 04:32.188
and I need you to keep
working on the radio.

04:32.397 --> 04:34.315
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

04:34.524 --> 04:35.608
They need
to take him now.

04:35.817 --> 04:36.734
Like hell, they do.
Get off.

04:36.944 --> 04:39.320
Give us a minute,
please. Raven--

04:39.529 --> 04:40.988
you agreed to this?

04:41.198 --> 04:42.740
We're taking him
back to the village

04:42.950 --> 04:44.075
where the massacre
took place.

04:44.284 --> 04:45.785
There's
a death ritual.

04:45.994 --> 04:47.954
It's the only way
to get our people

04:48.163 --> 04:49.455
out of Mount Weather.

04:51.041 --> 04:55.169
Then I'm coming, too,
and--don't worry--

04:55.379 --> 04:57.213
I'll bring
your damn radio.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.678
Oh...

05:06.265 --> 05:08.599
Oh...

06:14.249 --> 06:15.541
Anything?

06:15.751 --> 06:17.418
Keep looking.

06:17.627 --> 06:18.544
Whatever happened
to Harper,

06:18.754 --> 06:19.587
someone must have
seen something.

06:19.796 --> 06:20.713
How many places
could she be?

06:20.922 --> 06:22.256
We're in
a sealed bunker.

06:22.466 --> 06:24.216
There has to be rooms
we don't know about,

06:24.426 --> 06:26.010
places that
aren't mapped.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.012
Well?
Is it possible?

06:28.221 --> 06:29.805
I doubt it,
but maybe.

06:30.015 --> 06:31.849
Thanks. You are
just a big help.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.976
Easy, Miller.
Maya is on our side.

06:34.186 --> 06:35.186
Are you sure
about that?

06:35.395 --> 06:36.354
Yes. I'm sure.

06:36.563 --> 06:37.855
She's risking more
than any of us.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.023
Really? Is she's gonna
end up in the kennel, too,

06:39.274 --> 06:40.191
if she gets caught?

06:40.400 --> 06:43.652
Stop it.
I found something.

06:43.862 --> 06:46.822
That leads to an antenna
on the ground, OK?

06:47.032 --> 06:48.407
If we can
access the radio,

06:48.617 --> 06:50.618
we can send a message
over the Arkwide channel,

06:50.827 --> 06:51.952
tell them we're here.

06:52.162 --> 06:54.288
The only radio
is in the command center

06:54.498 --> 06:56.082
on level 7,
highly restricted.

06:56.291 --> 06:57.583
You got in before.

06:57.793 --> 06:59.835
Only because it was scheduled
for decontamination.

07:00.045 --> 07:01.212
That won't work again
so soon.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.880
We don't need
the radio.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.965
We need the wires
that run into it. Here.

07:05.175 --> 07:08.302
The art warehouse.
That I can get us into.

07:08.512 --> 07:11.055
Good. Now all
we have to do

07:11.264 --> 07:12.973
is break through a
two-foot section of wall,

07:13.183 --> 07:14.475
find the
outgoing wire,

07:14.684 --> 07:15.684
and Jack it to
a closed system

07:15.894 --> 07:16.936
without being
heard by anyone

07:17.145 --> 07:18.521
in the command center
or in the field.

07:18.730 --> 07:21.440
That's all, huh?
No.

07:21.650 --> 07:23.317
We'll also need to steal
some copper wire,

07:23.527 --> 07:25.152
the guard schedules,
and a walkie-talkie--

07:25.362 --> 07:28.114
oh, yeah--and
a big-ass hammer.

07:50.762 --> 07:53.639
Hey, you doing
all right?

07:55.725 --> 07:56.684
Yeah.

07:59.187 --> 08:01.355
You did
the right thing.

08:03.233 --> 08:05.985
Now I get
to live with it.

08:06.194 --> 08:08.320
You still think this truce
is a bad idea, don't you?

08:08.530 --> 08:10.072
I think we're wasting
time with politics

08:10.282 --> 08:12.032
while our friends
are in trouble.

08:12.242 --> 08:14.201
We need their army to get
to Mount Weather, Bellamy,

08:14.411 --> 08:15.536
and you know it.

08:15.745 --> 08:16.954
Their army has been
getting their ass kicked

08:17.164 --> 08:18.539
by Mount Weather
forever.

08:18.748 --> 08:20.749
What we need
is an inside man,

08:20.959 --> 08:22.501
someone to be
our eyes and ears.

08:22.711 --> 08:24.587
Forget it.
It's too dangerous.

08:24.796 --> 08:26.672
Clarke, if you can
make it out,

08:26.882 --> 08:28.132
I can make it in.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.885
I said no.

08:31.094 --> 08:33.637
Since I don't take
orders from you,

08:33.847 --> 08:36.974
I'm gonna need
a better reason.

08:37.184 --> 08:40.436
I can't lose
you, too, OK?

09:21.144 --> 09:22.603
Brief me.

09:22.812 --> 09:24.021
Yes, sir.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.981
The commander's force
never attacked the ark.

09:26.191 --> 09:28.234
Instead, at 0600
this morning,

09:28.443 --> 09:31.320
they withdrew into
these woods here.

09:31.530 --> 09:33.322
Outsiders never
withdraw, lieutenant.

09:33.532 --> 09:35.115
No, sir, but under
this commander,

09:35.325 --> 09:37.451
they do
make alliances.

09:37.661 --> 09:38.786
Is that what
happened here?

09:38.995 --> 09:40.204
It's unclear, sir,

09:40.413 --> 09:42.289
but it's a possibility
we need to consider.

09:42.499 --> 09:44.583
Sir, if this is
an alliance

09:44.793 --> 09:46.252
between the outsiders
and the ark,

09:46.461 --> 09:48.003
there are things we
can do to break it.

09:48.213 --> 09:49.588
We let them
kill each other

09:49.798 --> 09:50.756
so they don't
come here

09:51.007 --> 09:52.007
to take their
people back.

09:52.217 --> 09:54.176
I don't care how many
men they have.

09:54.386 --> 09:56.136
They will not get
past our defenses.

09:56.346 --> 09:59.515
Sir, we shouldn't take
this threat lightly.

10:01.351 --> 10:03.185
We're not,
lieutenant.

10:03.395 --> 10:04.853
You have my word
on that.

10:05.063 --> 10:06.647
Nothing is gonna
stop us

10:06.856 --> 10:09.316
from getting
to the ground.

10:21.663 --> 10:24.873
Clarke, it's safer
on our side.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.084
We need to trust
them, Bellamy.

10:28.461 --> 10:31.255
There are
no more sides.

10:40.515 --> 10:42.516
Hey...

10:43.643 --> 10:48.522
We need to talk
about Jaha.

10:48.732 --> 10:51.150
I can't keep him
locked up forever.

10:51.359 --> 10:53.652
Maybe I should
shocklash him.

10:54.863 --> 10:57.573
I was gonna
suggest a pardon.

10:57.782 --> 10:59.199
Hmm.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.415
Clarke
is a survivor.

11:08.418 --> 11:10.252
She'll get
through this, too.

11:16.051 --> 11:18.344
Natrona.

11:35.487 --> 11:37.946
"Natrona"?

11:40.033 --> 11:41.784
Traitor.

11:41.993 --> 11:43.702
My people fear me.

11:45.622 --> 11:48.874
They think the reaper
is still inside.

11:50.126 --> 11:53.045
You can talk to me

11:53.254 --> 11:55.089
about what happened.

11:55.298 --> 11:58.884
I can't.

11:59.094 --> 12:01.804
You're not
that monster.

12:04.182 --> 12:06.850
I hope you're right.

12:58.862 --> 13:00.904
Weapons.

13:01.114 --> 13:04.283
We need to disarm
before we enter.

13:56.044 --> 13:58.170
Nou ogonzaun.
Veida! Veida!

13:58.379 --> 14:00.214
Nou ogonzaun!
Veida!

14:00.423 --> 14:02.174
Veida! Ripa!

14:02.383 --> 14:03.342
Veida!
Veida!

14:25.824 --> 14:27.241
Uh!

14:32.831 --> 14:35.582
Commander, stop him.

14:35.792 --> 14:38.252
Please. They'll blame us
for this, too.

14:38.461 --> 14:40.587
Uh!

14:49.097 --> 14:52.015
The sky people
march with us now.

14:53.309 --> 14:56.937
Anyone who tries to stop that

14:57.146 --> 14:59.898
will pay with their life.

15:06.197 --> 15:07.656
Warm welcome.

15:31.264 --> 15:32.723
Right here.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.017
The communication lines
are behind this wall.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.613
Heh heh.

15:50.992 --> 15:53.702
Big-ass enough
for you?

15:53.912 --> 15:54.745
Wait. They'll hear you.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.872
This was the plan.
I knew it.

15:57.081 --> 15:58.332
She's afraid of losing
her blood supply.

15:58.541 --> 16:00.125
Look. You don't have
to like me, Miller,

16:00.126 --> 16:01.335
and you can blame me
all you want

16:01.544 --> 16:02.544
for what my people
are doing,

16:02.754 --> 16:04.004
but I'm trying to
make things right.

16:04.213 --> 16:06.173
Then get the hell
out of my way.

16:06.382 --> 16:07.716
5 seconds.

16:07.926 --> 16:09.009
What happens
in 5 seconds?

16:09.218 --> 16:11.720
Miller realizes
what a dick he is?

16:17.018 --> 16:19.353
Friend owed me
a favor.

16:19.562 --> 16:22.314
Time it to
the blasts.

16:37.664 --> 16:40.415
Jackpot.

16:54.097 --> 16:56.139
"People of Tondc,

16:56.349 --> 16:59.685
in fire, we cleanse
the pain of the past."

17:14.951 --> 17:16.201
Clarke...

18:36.282 --> 18:37.866
I've set it up
to play our SOS

18:38.076 --> 18:39.785
on a loop over
the Arkwide channel.

18:39.994 --> 18:41.578
If I can get it
to transmit,

18:41.788 --> 18:44.206
somebody is bound
to hear it.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.752
Oh, that don't
sound good.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.254
I've heard this

18:51.464 --> 18:53.381
on the black box
of the exodus ship

18:53.591 --> 18:57.135
right before it crashed.

18:57.345 --> 18:59.221
They crashed
the exodus ship.

18:59.430 --> 19:01.932
Jamming signal.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.601
What are they
jamming now?

19:04.811 --> 19:06.478
Everything,

19:06.687 --> 19:07.687
probably to keep our people
from talking to each other.

19:07.897 --> 19:09.356
Are we totally
screwed?

19:09.565 --> 19:12.317
I wouldn't say
totally.

19:16.114 --> 19:18.573
I lost someone
special to me, too.

19:21.661 --> 19:25.288
Her name was Costia.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.707
She was captured
by the ice nation,

19:27.917 --> 19:31.419
whose queen believed
she knew my secrets.

19:31.629 --> 19:32.921
Because
she was mine...

19:34.757 --> 19:38.885
They tortured her,
killed her,

19:39.095 --> 19:41.555
cut off her head.

19:41.764 --> 19:43.223
I'm sorry.

19:43.432 --> 19:45.809
I thought I'd never
get over the pain,

19:46.018 --> 19:48.353
but I did.

19:48.563 --> 19:50.105
How?

19:50.314 --> 19:53.275
By recognizing it
for what it is--

19:55.194 --> 19:57.279
weakness.

19:57.488 --> 20:00.866
What is? Love?

20:02.285 --> 20:04.911
So you just
stopped caring

20:05.121 --> 20:07.622
about everyone?

20:12.086 --> 20:14.087
I could never
do that.

20:14.297 --> 20:17.257
Then you put the people
you care about

20:17.466 --> 20:20.552
in danger, and the pain
will never go away.

20:22.889 --> 20:25.599
The dead are gone,
Clarke.

20:27.643 --> 20:30.187
The living
are hungry.

21:07.350 --> 21:11.019
Please accept this gift,
commander.

21:11.229 --> 21:13.688
We drink this
at special occasions.

21:13.898 --> 21:16.650
I believe
this qualifies.

21:27.495 --> 21:30.956
Thank you, Marcus
of the sky people.

21:31.165 --> 21:32.666
You're welcome,
Lexa.

21:32.667 --> 21:36.544
Kom trikru.

21:36.754 --> 21:39.089
Just don't drink
too much of it.

21:40.508 --> 21:43.551
Clarke, let us
drink together.

21:43.761 --> 21:46.012
It would be
my pleasure.

22:02.530 --> 22:04.447
And allow me.

22:20.214 --> 22:23.383
Tonight we celebrate
our newfound peace.

22:23.592 --> 22:26.011
Tomorrow
we plan our war.

22:26.220 --> 22:29.389
To those we've lost

22:29.598 --> 22:31.766
and to those
we shall soon find.

22:34.895 --> 22:37.522
Uh!

22:43.279 --> 22:45.572
It's poison!

22:45.781 --> 22:47.574
It was the sky people.

22:47.783 --> 22:50.452
Yaagh!

22:50.661 --> 22:51.786
This wasn't us.

22:51.996 --> 22:52.912
You have to know
this wasn't us.

22:56.959 --> 22:58.710
No.

23:01.464 --> 23:03.757
No. No.
We didn't do this.

23:03.966 --> 23:05.050
Gustus warned me
about you,

23:05.259 --> 23:06.343
but I didn't listen.

23:06.552 --> 23:07.385
Lexa, please--

23:07.595 --> 23:08.762
tell me something,
Clarke.

23:08.929 --> 23:10.347
When you plunged the knife
into the heart

23:10.514 --> 23:12.557
of the boy you loved,

23:12.767 --> 23:14.851
did you not wish
that it was mine?

23:23.319 --> 23:25.445
That's not mine.

23:27.490 --> 23:28.573
I'm telling you,
that's not mine.

23:28.783 --> 23:30.075
He put it there
when he searched me.

23:35.956 --> 23:39.542
No sky person
leaves this room.

23:44.632 --> 23:46.091
Do something.

23:46.300 --> 23:47.717
Indra...

24:07.321 --> 24:08.488
Damn it.

24:08.697 --> 24:10.073
So now we're
totally screwed?

24:10.282 --> 24:11.783
Our message
is broadcasting,

24:11.992 --> 24:13.118
but it's over
a jammed frequency.

24:13.327 --> 24:14.452
So then
unjam it.

24:14.662 --> 24:16.037
What do you think
I've been trying to do?

24:16.247 --> 24:17.122
Looks like the only
way to shut it down

24:17.331 --> 24:18.415
is from the source.

24:18.624 --> 24:19.916
I need 5 minutes in
the command center.

24:20.126 --> 24:21.418
No way. You heard Maya.
It's too dangerous.

24:21.627 --> 24:24.337
The guard is coming.

24:24.547 --> 24:25.922
Right.
No. Leave it.

24:26.132 --> 24:27.590
Right.

24:28.843 --> 24:29.717
OK.

24:39.687 --> 24:40.854
All right. Quick.

24:45.526 --> 24:48.319
He's too close.
What are we gonna do?

24:50.281 --> 24:51.990
I got an idea.
What?

24:52.199 --> 24:53.450
This.

24:56.162 --> 24:59.706
Out now.

24:59.915 --> 25:01.916
Don't let me catch
you kids in here again.

25:03.461 --> 25:06.379
Sorry.

25:10.426 --> 25:12.552
Raven...

25:12.761 --> 25:14.053
I need to know
the truth.

25:14.263 --> 25:16.055
I'd step back
if I was you.

25:16.265 --> 25:18.183
You wanted me to
kill Lexa yesterday.

25:18.392 --> 25:21.853
If you tried to poison
her, I need to know.

25:23.063 --> 25:26.941
You're the only
murderer here.

25:33.824 --> 25:35.867
Leave me alone.

25:37.828 --> 25:39.954
You gave me
no choice.

25:40.164 --> 25:43.416
Why did you
turn yourself in?

25:46.545 --> 25:47.587
Baby, you OK?

26:13.989 --> 26:16.157
Listen to me, Clarke.

26:16.367 --> 26:18.451
I know how you feel,

26:18.661 --> 26:20.870
like the pain
will never go away,

26:21.080 --> 26:22.372
but Lexa is wrong.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.582
You won't be haunted
by this forever.

26:24.792 --> 26:27.418
The pain will fade.

26:27.628 --> 26:30.255
What got me through
was loving you.

26:37.555 --> 26:39.889
What is it?

26:41.058 --> 26:44.185
You're talking
about dad?

26:44.395 --> 26:46.187
What I did to Finn

26:46.397 --> 26:47.855
was nothing like
what you did to him.

26:48.065 --> 26:49.357
Don't do this
now, Clarke.

26:49.567 --> 26:50.984
I was protecting
everyone.

26:51.193 --> 26:52.485
I didn't
have a choice.

26:52.695 --> 26:53.736
You did.
No.

26:53.946 --> 26:55.113
You turned him in.

26:55.322 --> 26:57.574
No. I trusted Thelonious
to talk to your father

26:57.783 --> 26:59.367
and convince him
not to go public.

26:59.577 --> 27:01.286
You knew dad
would never stop.

27:01.495 --> 27:02.787
You knew what would
happen to him.

27:02.997 --> 27:05.331
I was protecting
everyone, too.

27:05.541 --> 27:08.585
I was protecting you.

27:12.631 --> 27:15.174
Clarke, please.

27:22.683 --> 27:25.518
We are the same.

27:36.363 --> 27:37.822
They find the radio?

27:38.032 --> 27:39.324
No. Where's Monty?

27:39.533 --> 27:41.576
Thought he was
with you.

27:41.785 --> 27:44.537
I haven't
seen him.

27:57.926 --> 27:59.719
Again?

27:59.928 --> 28:02.055
We were hosed down
yesterday.

28:02.264 --> 28:04.849
Routine follow-up.
Shouldn't take long.

28:21.283 --> 28:23.284
We have to get
out of here.

28:26.163 --> 28:28.247
We have to get
out of here.

28:31.960 --> 28:33.878
Tearing each other
and yourself apart

28:34.088 --> 28:35.922
isn't a way
to get through this.

28:43.681 --> 28:46.849
Lexa needs this alliance
just as much as we do.

28:47.059 --> 28:48.851
She's shown herself
to be flexible.

28:49.061 --> 28:51.145
She listens to you.

28:51.355 --> 28:53.898
She thinks we
tried to kill her.

28:54.108 --> 28:55.650
But we know
we didn't.

28:55.859 --> 28:57.443
So let's figure out
who did.

28:57.653 --> 28:59.987
Who would
want her dead?

29:00.197 --> 29:02.073
Too many to count.

29:02.282 --> 29:04.450
Forming an alliance
with you was a risk,

29:04.660 --> 29:06.744
especially after what
Finn did to this village.

29:06.954 --> 29:07.787
So it had
to be someone

29:07.996 --> 29:08.913
trying to break
the alliance.

29:20.926 --> 29:22.385
How's Gustus?

29:22.594 --> 29:23.553
Gustus will live.

29:24.847 --> 29:26.222
Wait. Wait.
What are you doing?

29:26.432 --> 29:27.432
She didn't
poison anyone.

29:27.641 --> 29:29.434
I argued for
all of you to die,

29:29.643 --> 29:31.686
but the commander
is merciful.

29:31.895 --> 29:33.354
She wants only one.

29:33.564 --> 29:36.357
She's innocent.
I don't care.

29:36.567 --> 29:38.651
They move,
they bleed.

29:38.861 --> 29:41.571
Hey, hey, stop.
Let her go.

29:44.658 --> 29:46.242
The rest of you
are free.

29:46.452 --> 29:49.412
When she's dead,
so is the alliance.

29:51.457 --> 29:53.499
You should run.

30:03.218 --> 30:05.720
I take no joy
in this, raven.

30:07.598 --> 30:11.184
But this time,
justice will be done.

30:11.393 --> 30:15.772
I didn't do it.
How is that justice?

30:15.981 --> 30:17.774
We have to do
something.

30:17.983 --> 30:18.983
Wait. We can't.

30:19.193 --> 30:20.401
Lincoln,
talk to them.

30:20.611 --> 30:22.570
Aah!

30:28.827 --> 30:30.453
Aah!

30:30.662 --> 30:33.372
Lincoln, talk to them.
These are your people.

30:33.582 --> 30:35.708
Not anymore.

30:35.918 --> 30:37.502
You're not longer
safe here, my friend.

30:37.711 --> 30:39.504
I'll do my best to
make sure you get away.

30:39.713 --> 30:41.422
Then you'll be
on your own.

30:43.217 --> 30:46.010
Clarke,
we need to move now.

30:46.220 --> 30:49.055
I can't save
anyone.

30:56.230 --> 30:59.774
Say something.

31:04.696 --> 31:06.823
Clarke, now.

31:10.661 --> 31:13.120
It wasn't
in the bottle.

31:17.584 --> 31:18.709
Clarke, stop.
What are you doing?

31:18.919 --> 31:20.211
You'll get
yourself killed.

31:20.420 --> 31:23.256
I need that bottle now.

31:24.550 --> 31:25.716
Stop.

31:28.387 --> 31:31.556
Let her pass!

31:31.765 --> 31:34.350
One of your people tried
to kill you, Lexa,

31:34.560 --> 31:36.018
not one of mine.

31:36.228 --> 31:37.770
You should've run.

31:37.980 --> 31:40.523
I can prove it.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.372
Explain.

31:56.582 --> 31:58.291
The poison wasn't
in the bottle.

31:58.500 --> 31:59.750
It was in the cup.

32:09.511 --> 32:11.220
It was you.

32:13.390 --> 32:17.018
He tested the cup.
He searched raven.

32:17.227 --> 32:19.020
Gustus would
never harm me.

32:19.229 --> 32:21.022
You weren't
the target.

32:21.231 --> 32:23.566
The alliance was.

32:23.775 --> 32:26.319
We didn't do this,
and you know it.

32:37.998 --> 32:40.708
This alliance would
cost you your life, Heda.

32:43.420 --> 32:45.671
I could not
let that happen.

32:48.258 --> 32:51.344
This treachery
will cost you yours.

33:00.062 --> 33:03.814
Uhh...

33:22.084 --> 33:24.543
Come on.

33:28.799 --> 33:32.218
Alpha station,
you better be listening.

33:35.097 --> 33:37.807
OK. Here we go.

33:38.016 --> 33:42.019
Jamming signal
deactivated.

33:42.229 --> 33:44.522
Jasper, on radio: We don't know
how much time we have left.

33:44.731 --> 33:47.566
Please hurry.
This is Jasper Jordan.

33:47.776 --> 33:49.819
We need help.
47 of us are trapped...

33:50.028 --> 33:51.779
Yes!

33:51.989 --> 33:55.408
Yes! Yes--

33:55.617 --> 33:57.201
please hurry.

33:57.411 --> 34:00.037
This is Jasper Jordan.
We need help.

34:00.247 --> 34:01.956
You sure they went
together to that village?

34:02.165 --> 34:03.749
Sure as we can be.

34:03.959 --> 34:05.710
Sir, I told you

34:05.919 --> 34:08.421
we need more boots
on the ground.

34:08.630 --> 34:10.423
Sergeant...

34:10.632 --> 34:12.466
Why aren't you
at your post?

34:12.676 --> 34:15.511
Sir. Routine Decon, sir.

34:20.100 --> 34:21.976
All clear, gentlemen.

34:36.324 --> 34:39.410
Hold up.

34:39.619 --> 34:41.412
You forgot
to log in.

34:43.331 --> 34:47.418
Whoops.
I'm always doing that.

34:56.386 --> 34:57.845
Oh.

35:05.729 --> 35:11.150
Thanks for saving me.
Take care.

35:15.864 --> 35:19.408
You said it
was all clear.

35:20.911 --> 35:23.287
Your entry says
something else.

35:23.497 --> 35:26.207
You sure? Huh.
That's weird.

35:26.416 --> 35:29.085
If you don't mind,
I'll fix it later.

35:29.294 --> 35:31.170
I have another
room to check.

35:34.633 --> 35:36.717
Oh!

35:52.442 --> 35:55.486
Ugh...

35:59.908 --> 36:02.451
Uh!

36:02.661 --> 36:06.789
This would've
been Finn.

36:08.250 --> 36:11.544
Rrgh!

37:05.223 --> 37:07.141
Ugh...

37:17.485 --> 37:19.737
We're not
so different,

37:19.946 --> 37:22.114
are we?

37:37.464 --> 37:40.132
How did you know
it was Gustus?

37:40.342 --> 37:42.885
He'd do anything
for her

37:43.094 --> 37:45.304
to protect her.

37:45.513 --> 37:47.681
Just makes sense.

37:47.891 --> 37:50.309
Look at the thanks
he got.

37:52.062 --> 37:53.520
Guys...

37:54.648 --> 37:55.814
What is it?

37:56.024 --> 37:59.985
Listen to this.

38:00.195 --> 38:03.280
Talk to him.
Say something.

38:03.490 --> 38:05.324
It's repeating.

38:05.533 --> 38:07.284
They're alive.

38:07.494 --> 38:09.370
We need
to do this now.

38:09.579 --> 38:12.873
You've got the alliance.
Now is the time to use it.

38:13.083 --> 38:15.417
First, we need
an inside man.

38:15.627 --> 38:17.503
You were right.

38:17.712 --> 38:19.046
Without someone
on the inside

38:19.256 --> 38:21.674
to lower their defenses,
turn off the acid fog,

38:21.883 --> 38:24.343
an army is useless.

38:24.552 --> 38:25.886
You should go.

38:26.096 --> 38:27.721
I thought you
hated that plan,

38:27.931 --> 38:29.473
that I would
get myself killed.

38:29.683 --> 38:33.936
I was being weak.
It's worth the risk.

38:36.231 --> 38:38.649
My map of
Mount Weather.

38:38.858 --> 38:41.485
Find a way to get on
that radio and talk to us.

38:45.865 --> 38:47.866
Good luck.

38:49.661 --> 38:51.203
Bell,
how are you gonna--

38:51.413 --> 38:53.289
I can get you
through the tunnels.

38:53.498 --> 38:55.666
He can't
go back there, not yet.

38:55.917 --> 38:57.918
Let me show you
what to look for.

38:58.128 --> 39:00.170
Look.
I have to.

39:00.380 --> 39:02.423
I need to face
what I've done.

39:02.632 --> 39:04.967
Then let's face it
together.

39:05.176 --> 39:07.678
No. You're needed here.
You know our ways.

39:07.887 --> 39:09.972
Without that,
this alliance will fail.

39:12.309 --> 39:14.768
I won't
let that happen.

39:14.978 --> 39:17.604
I know you won't.

39:42.922 --> 39:46.884
Love is weakness.

40:02.359 --> 40:04.818
Clarke...

40:10.200 --> 40:12.451
This is for you.

40:15.121 --> 40:17.998
They're ashes
from the fire.

40:18.208 --> 40:21.085
I thought you could
scatter them somewhere,

40:21.294 --> 40:24.171
might help you
say good-bye.

40:24.381 --> 40:26.924
I already
said good-bye.

41:11.094 --> 41:12.803
Uh!

41:17.892 --> 41:19.685
Harper.

41:19.894 --> 41:24.940
Hey, Harper, what
did they do to you?

41:25.150 --> 41:29.069
47.

41:29.279 --> 41:32.990
They built one
for each of us.
