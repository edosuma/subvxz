WEBVTT

00:29.612 --> 00:33.199
Hans Jonas discussed the responsibilities
of modern science in relation to life.

00:35.285 --> 00:38.371
I named this virus the Jonas Virus.

00:39.539 --> 00:42.083
It is my responsibility to find a cure.

00:44.627 --> 00:45.712
I will not give up.

01:23.208 --> 01:28.546
I'M FUCKING SEXY

01:49.025 --> 01:51.528
-Hey. Help me!
-Fuck.

01:54.906 --> 01:55.824
Shit.

01:59.202 --> 02:01.037
Damn it. Come here.

04:18.883 --> 04:20.093
Ji-min!

04:20.176 --> 04:21.594
-Stop her!
-What are you doing?

04:21.678 --> 04:22.804
-Let go.
-What's with you?

04:22.887 --> 04:24.180
Let go of me!

04:24.264 --> 04:25.431
-Please come down.
-Don't.

04:25.515 --> 04:28.226
I want to die! Leave me alone!

04:28.309 --> 04:29.394
Don't be like this.

04:29.477 --> 04:31.688
I don't want to live!

04:31.771 --> 04:33.940
-Ji-min.
-I want to die!

04:34.023 --> 04:37.694
Please leave me alone! Please!

04:37.777 --> 04:39.821
Let go of me!

04:39.904 --> 04:43.616
Please let me go!

04:45.910 --> 04:47.912
My mom and dad both died.

04:51.040 --> 04:53.209
What am I supposed to do alone?

04:57.839 --> 04:59.632
Why would you die, you crazy idiot?

05:00.425 --> 05:01.843
What's the use in living?

05:02.468 --> 05:03.845
Still, you should live anyway.

05:04.804 --> 05:05.972
I have nobody.

05:07.849 --> 05:10.935
I don't have a mom or a dad.

05:12.520 --> 05:15.064
I have nowhere to go
and no one waiting for me.

05:16.566 --> 05:19.694
No one to scold me or praise me.

05:21.195 --> 05:22.447
Do you know how that feels?

05:26.200 --> 05:27.785
No, I don't.

05:27.869 --> 05:29.954
So stop acting like you know everything.

05:30.580 --> 05:32.165
Who are you to tell me to live?

05:33.249 --> 05:34.959
Have you been in my shoes?

05:35.043 --> 05:36.627
-No.
-Exactly.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.047
Just leave me alone.

05:40.798 --> 05:44.135
I almost always come last in every exam.

05:45.428 --> 05:47.847
Well, not completely last.

05:51.142 --> 05:53.102
Whenever I get my report card, my dad says

05:53.728 --> 05:56.314
my grades won't shoot up
and get me into Seoul National University,

05:56.397 --> 05:57.940
so I shouldn't bother having hope.

05:59.859 --> 06:02.403
He says I should just
make sure I don't get hurt or sick

06:04.280 --> 06:05.907
and to just be healthy.

06:06.532 --> 06:07.700
I don't want to hear it.

06:08.451 --> 06:09.702
I don't want to hear anything.

06:11.037 --> 06:12.497
I didn't believe him.

06:14.415 --> 06:16.459
He'd love it
if I got into Seoul University.

06:17.627 --> 06:19.462
He was only saying that.

06:21.672 --> 06:22.548
But…

06:25.259 --> 06:27.345
there was something he said
that I did believe.

06:32.308 --> 06:34.310
He said that if anything happened to me…

06:38.189 --> 06:40.441
he'd be the first one there.

06:41.734 --> 06:42.902
But he didn't come.

06:45.988 --> 06:46.906
He didn't.

06:50.493 --> 06:51.452
But who knows?

06:53.454 --> 06:54.831
Maybe he can't come.

06:58.459 --> 06:59.794
What if

07:00.545 --> 07:01.796
my dad died?

07:04.507 --> 07:06.217
At least you have hope.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.012
I have nothing.

07:13.391 --> 07:14.392
Is there hope?

07:20.189 --> 07:22.275
Should I wait for my dad?

07:23.943 --> 07:26.028
Or should I run away?

07:27.405 --> 07:29.115
I don't know anything.

07:30.992 --> 07:33.035
I-sak died, Gyeong-su died…

07:35.496 --> 07:38.207
I wish no one else would.

07:39.750 --> 07:40.751
What the hell?

07:41.586 --> 07:42.670
Why are you crying?

07:43.254 --> 07:44.589
Please don't die, Ji-min.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.428
I wish no one else would die.

07:51.554 --> 07:52.430
No one.

08:00.146 --> 08:01.189
I want to leave.

08:03.441 --> 08:05.485
I feel like I'll go insane in here.

08:06.986 --> 08:08.196
Okay, let's go.

08:10.823 --> 08:11.866
Let's leave.

08:13.743 --> 08:15.161
I hate it here.

08:18.539 --> 08:19.665
But how do we get out?

08:21.876 --> 08:23.920
And we have nowhere to go anyway.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.433
Ji-min. Sorry, but just a minute.

08:51.197 --> 08:52.240
Gross.

08:53.658 --> 08:56.202
Can't you people smell? It stinks.

08:56.285 --> 08:57.662
Breathe through your mouth.

08:58.162 --> 08:59.455
What are you doing?

09:01.874 --> 09:03.501
I think we can get out of here.

09:05.836 --> 09:08.673
This is where we are.
This is where Cheong-san is.

09:09.257 --> 09:13.177
If we play music only on this speaker,
the zombies will go left.

09:13.261 --> 09:15.179
Then we'll take the stairs on the right,

09:15.263 --> 09:18.558
get Cheong-san, and go to the rooftop
using the center stairs.

09:19.392 --> 09:20.226
The rooftop? Why?

09:21.310 --> 09:22.770
Choppers keep flying around.

09:23.521 --> 09:25.856
If we light a fire there,
they may come to save us.

09:26.440 --> 09:29.735
Will the zombies really go
toward the speakers?

09:30.319 --> 09:32.738
I think she's right
that they're drawn to sound.

09:32.822 --> 09:35.908
That's right. They come running
whenever they hear us.

09:35.992 --> 09:38.869
Can we just turn on certain speakers?

09:38.953 --> 09:41.998
Yes. We'll turn on the ones
in the cafeteria, yard, and library, too,

09:42.081 --> 09:43.666
and draw them there.

09:43.749 --> 09:46.586
That's right. You were
in the broadcasting club in tenth grade.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.755
Yes, because my mom made me.

09:49.839 --> 09:51.257
That's all good, but

09:52.466 --> 09:53.968
how can we play music?

09:54.677 --> 09:56.637
There's no Internet so we can't stream.

09:59.682 --> 10:00.558
That.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.354
That?

10:06.939 --> 10:09.609
This is ancient. Will it work?

10:42.058 --> 10:42.933
Who wants to do it?

10:44.685 --> 10:46.437
I've never done it before.

10:46.520 --> 10:48.856
Somebody do it. Anyone.

10:49.440 --> 10:51.359
I'll do it, then.

10:56.781 --> 10:57.990
Cheong-san, are you there?

10:58.699 --> 10:59.992
-We--
-What are you doing?

11:00.743 --> 11:01.577
Check.

11:02.161 --> 11:03.537
Cheong-san, do you hear us?

11:04.163 --> 11:05.414
It's Su-hyeok.

11:06.123 --> 11:09.627
We'll come to you so stay put.

11:09.710 --> 11:10.878
Got it?

11:11.420 --> 11:13.964
Don't come, moron. You can't come here.

11:14.632 --> 11:16.342
I know what you'll say,

11:17.218 --> 11:20.096
but we can't hear you from here.

11:20.179 --> 11:21.472
Don't come.

11:21.972 --> 11:24.975
So don't go anywhere. Wait for us.

11:26.268 --> 11:29.230
You really can't go anywhere, okay?

11:32.274 --> 11:33.317
We'll come now.

11:34.777 --> 11:35.861
All good.

11:36.445 --> 11:38.114
Let's get out of here.

11:38.197 --> 11:40.282
The smell of poop makes me want to barf.

11:40.366 --> 11:41.242
It's yours.

11:41.826 --> 11:43.869
-It's not just mine.
-Yes, it is.

11:43.953 --> 11:45.371
-Really?
-Yes.

11:45.454 --> 11:47.081
These punks.

11:54.463 --> 11:55.715
Cheong-san.

12:00.678 --> 12:02.346
Please stay still.

12:03.556 --> 12:06.142
I know you never listen to me,
but listen this time.

12:27.204 --> 12:28.497
Why won't it work?

12:29.707 --> 12:32.084
-Isn't it useless, then?
-That's right.

12:35.796 --> 12:37.757
Time for meditation.

12:42.303 --> 12:46.307
Once again, another joyful day
at school has begun.

12:48.934 --> 12:51.729
Everyone, close your eyes

12:52.730 --> 12:55.858
and calm your hearts.

12:58.360 --> 13:03.115
-Broadcasting room first.
-Happy lives come from happy hearts.

13:06.494 --> 13:08.370
Turn off the right and middle speakers.

13:08.454 --> 13:10.372
BUILDING CENTER - RIGHT - LEFT

13:15.836 --> 13:16.712
It sounds distant.

13:17.713 --> 13:19.381
Yes. I only hear it from the left.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.804
-They're going to the speakers.
-Really?

13:26.472 --> 13:27.473
It worked, right?

13:33.896 --> 13:34.939
Damn it.

13:39.026 --> 13:41.195
ONE HEART

13:55.376 --> 13:56.293
Bare-su.

13:56.794 --> 13:57.795
Let's go.

14:00.422 --> 14:02.508
-Hold on.
-What? Why?

14:10.307 --> 14:12.393
There's one more.

14:12.476 --> 14:13.686
What?

14:37.918 --> 14:39.545
I'm really going now.

14:43.048 --> 14:43.883
Let's go.

14:43.966 --> 14:45.384
Walk slowly.

14:48.429 --> 14:49.972
Check the left first.

14:56.937 --> 14:57.938
BROADCASTING ROOM

15:00.232 --> 15:01.275
Fuck.

15:01.901 --> 15:02.776
Close it.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.070
Close it.

15:07.573 --> 15:09.408
Fuck, I could've been killed.

15:09.491 --> 15:10.701
Asshole, you said it was clear.

15:10.784 --> 15:13.787
-What? Why?
-There's still one left.

15:14.496 --> 15:15.456
Look.

15:30.471 --> 15:31.388
What do we do?

15:31.472 --> 15:33.265
Is something wrong with him?

15:33.349 --> 15:34.475
Not any more than you.

15:34.558 --> 15:36.602
-Shut up, you prick.
-Sorry.

15:36.685 --> 15:39.688
Everyone else followed the sound,
but he's still there by himself.

15:40.272 --> 15:41.398
Maybe he's deaf.

15:41.482 --> 15:44.818
Fuck. How could he hear when he's dead?

15:44.902 --> 15:47.613
What about the others?
They all respond to sound.

15:48.989 --> 15:50.115
Shit. Beats me.

15:51.241 --> 15:52.117
Damn it.

15:53.243 --> 15:54.244
How do we get out?

15:54.328 --> 15:55.412
Hold on.

15:56.163 --> 15:57.414
Let's wait a little bit.

15:59.959 --> 16:00.876
I'll look.

16:01.585 --> 16:02.586
Let's wait.

16:07.257 --> 16:11.261
We are all beautiful.

16:13.472 --> 16:19.228
We are in
the most beautiful times of our lives.

16:27.277 --> 16:28.487
We can't wait any longer.

16:29.405 --> 16:32.074
Take the others and walk past him
as carefully as possible.

16:33.367 --> 16:34.785
I'll do what I can from behind.

16:38.539 --> 16:39.373
Okay.

16:43.377 --> 16:44.420
Let's go.

16:47.047 --> 16:52.594
…will never perish
even when all else withers and dies.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.055
Hold on tight.

16:56.306 --> 16:57.558
Don't let go.

17:00.978 --> 17:07.943
BROADCASTING ROOM

18:08.087 --> 18:09.046
Run!

18:15.302 --> 18:16.136
Damn it.

18:38.075 --> 18:39.201
Lee Cheong-san.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.876
ROOFTOP

19:28.375 --> 19:31.336
Today will be another joyful day.

19:33.505 --> 19:35.966
You moron.

19:37.718 --> 19:39.094
You let this loser get you?

19:45.184 --> 19:46.268
Thanks.

19:46.351 --> 19:48.395
Of course. I saved your life.

19:50.480 --> 19:51.398
Where's Cheong-san?

19:51.481 --> 19:52.399
Cheong-san?

19:53.442 --> 19:54.943
Why do you ask?

19:55.027 --> 19:55.986
I want to kill him.

19:56.653 --> 19:57.946
What are you talking about?

20:01.200 --> 20:02.492
I'm going to kill him.

20:10.959 --> 20:11.877
You're badly hurt.

20:13.253 --> 20:14.087
Are you okay?

20:17.132 --> 20:18.467
I'm good.

20:18.550 --> 20:20.469
I'm so fucking good.

20:21.678 --> 20:22.638
Where's Cheong-san?

20:23.805 --> 20:24.806
Stop it.

20:29.102 --> 20:30.520
You were always like that.

20:32.481 --> 20:33.523
That's right.

20:36.193 --> 20:37.069
"Do this."

20:38.237 --> 20:39.112
"Don't do that."

20:39.988 --> 20:41.323
Always ordering me around.

20:42.991 --> 20:44.243
It's okay.

20:46.119 --> 20:47.704
Since you were a better fighter than me.

20:49.456 --> 20:51.667
But you can't do that anymore. Fuck!

21:03.345 --> 21:05.013
You're nothing special.

21:36.003 --> 21:36.962
Scared, right?

21:38.422 --> 21:39.506
I know you're scared.

21:40.882 --> 21:41.883
Hey.

21:43.427 --> 21:44.344
Aren't you scared?

21:46.680 --> 21:47.639
You crazy asshole.

21:49.725 --> 21:51.143
You weak asshole.

22:05.907 --> 22:07.868
You motherfuckers!

22:07.951 --> 22:09.161
I said stop it!

22:27.929 --> 22:28.972
Let's go.

22:34.311 --> 22:35.228
Hurry up.

22:38.023 --> 22:39.608
There's one coming. Run!

22:44.404 --> 22:46.198
Hey, what's the code?

22:48.283 --> 22:49.910
-Three-two-one-zero!
-Three-two-two-zero?

22:50.786 --> 22:52.371
Three-two-one-zero, damn it!

22:52.454 --> 22:54.664
Three, two, two…

22:55.957 --> 22:57.292
It won't open! What is it?

22:58.293 --> 22:59.628
-Three-two-one-zero!
-Damn it!

22:59.711 --> 23:01.588
Three, two…

23:01.671 --> 23:02.547
Mi-jin!

23:09.805 --> 23:12.224
It worked! It's open!

23:12.307 --> 23:13.600
-Come on!
-Hey! Hurry!

23:18.021 --> 23:19.523
Hurry!

23:19.606 --> 23:20.649
Joon-seong!

23:20.732 --> 23:21.733
Help me.

23:21.817 --> 23:23.151
Come on!

23:24.528 --> 23:25.987
What are you waiting for? Hurry!

23:26.613 --> 23:27.656
Hurry! Get in here!

23:29.199 --> 23:30.117
Get in here!

23:39.501 --> 23:40.544
I'm fucking tired.

23:41.962 --> 23:44.589
-Damn it.
-Are you crying?

23:46.216 --> 23:47.384
You're crying?

23:48.093 --> 23:49.469
How humiliating.

23:51.596 --> 23:53.473
What is this?

23:53.557 --> 23:55.642
What the fuck happened to you?

23:55.725 --> 23:57.436
What do I do now?

23:57.519 --> 23:58.437
Let me see.

23:59.396 --> 24:00.397
Were you stabbed?

24:01.773 --> 24:04.192
Why the fuck did you get stabbed,
you moron?

24:06.903 --> 24:09.656
Get the first aid kit.
I said get the fucking first aid kit!

24:10.323 --> 24:11.658
Where is it?

24:15.245 --> 24:16.580
Hey.

24:18.039 --> 24:18.915
Where were you?

24:20.000 --> 24:20.834
Cheong-san.

24:21.877 --> 24:22.878
Where's On-jo?

24:24.463 --> 24:25.380
On-jo!

24:28.800 --> 24:29.968
Are you hurt? Are you okay?

24:30.886 --> 24:31.720
Asshole.

24:33.221 --> 24:35.223
How did you know I was here?

24:37.726 --> 24:39.436
I told you not to go.

24:39.519 --> 24:41.229
Why don't you ever listen?

24:41.813 --> 24:44.191
Hey, save the lovers' quarrel for later.

24:44.274 --> 24:45.484
Let's go.

24:46.485 --> 24:48.528
-Where?
-We have to get to the rooftop.

24:48.612 --> 24:50.697
-Before the music ends.
-Let's go. Hurry.

24:50.780 --> 24:51.615
Wait.

24:51.698 --> 24:53.909
Where's Su-hyeok? Su-hyeok isn't here.

24:54.701 --> 24:57.454
-Hey. Where are you going?
-Hey!

25:19.643 --> 25:21.770
Are you insane? Don't go by yourself--

25:21.853 --> 25:24.439
-Go in! Go inside!
-They're coming.

25:25.607 --> 25:26.691
Hurry!

25:29.110 --> 25:30.278
The curtains.

25:38.870 --> 25:40.038
There's a zombie there.

25:41.498 --> 25:43.750
It's caught under the piano,
so it can't move.

25:54.719 --> 25:55.804
We can't make it…

25:57.806 --> 25:58.974
to the rooftop, can we?

26:01.476 --> 26:02.894
We're trapped again, aren't we?

26:04.938 --> 26:06.439
There are zombies outside, so…

26:08.108 --> 26:09.442
Let's think a little.

26:09.526 --> 26:10.527
This is so annoying.

26:20.120 --> 26:20.954
Hey.

26:21.663 --> 26:22.706
Hey, Prez.

26:25.292 --> 26:26.293
Were you bit?

26:27.127 --> 26:28.169
That's a bite mark, right?

26:41.349 --> 26:43.852
Don't push, jerk!

26:46.062 --> 26:47.564
Can't you see we're all in line?

26:49.190 --> 26:50.400
We're all waiting!

26:58.617 --> 26:59.993
I'm sick of this food.

27:00.076 --> 27:02.162
I can't eat pork. Is there anything else?

27:02.954 --> 27:04.039
-Hey!
-Take it and go!

27:04.122 --> 27:05.832
-Hold on.
-Get out.

27:05.915 --> 27:07.751
I can't eat pork!

27:07.834 --> 27:10.170
-Give it a rest!
-That's enough!

27:10.253 --> 27:11.755
Do you think this is your home?

27:24.351 --> 27:27.228
I'm okay.
Are our phones still not working?

27:28.021 --> 27:30.940
No. They won't work here either.

27:32.859 --> 27:34.194
Shouldn't an assembly member

27:35.737 --> 27:37.364
be able to find a way out of here?

27:40.408 --> 27:41.284
I know.

27:41.868 --> 27:43.411
I've never been treated like this.

27:43.495 --> 27:46.247
There's nothing
an assembly member can't do.

27:46.331 --> 27:47.582
Don't be sarcastic.

27:48.583 --> 27:52.629
I've never done
anything illegal or improper.

27:52.712 --> 27:54.547
Then can't you do it just this once?

27:55.256 --> 27:56.383
I really need to go.

27:57.842 --> 27:58.843
Wait a little while.

27:59.469 --> 28:03.223
Once we're tested, I'll get you a chopper
and send you to the school.

28:03.306 --> 28:04.683
The test isn't the problem.

28:05.392 --> 28:07.936
Even if we test negative,
we'll still have to quarantine.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.897
It was nine days for MERS,
two weeks for Covid-19,

28:10.980 --> 28:12.774
and three weeks for Ebola.

28:13.483 --> 28:16.945
Then what? We have to stay here
even after we get tested?

28:17.570 --> 28:19.531
It depends on the incubation period--

28:28.623 --> 28:30.125
Please try not to leave leftovers,

28:30.208 --> 28:32.502
and leave your empty food containers
by the door.

28:33.169 --> 28:34.087
Wait.

28:37.006 --> 28:37.966
Special Mission Unit?

28:38.675 --> 28:40.135
I was a master sergeant.

28:41.010 --> 28:42.011
Are you a senior officer?

28:42.929 --> 28:45.223
He was also with Special Forces.

28:45.306 --> 28:46.433
Nice to meet you, sir.

28:46.516 --> 28:49.686
Sorry. I'd buy you a meal
if we had met outside.

28:49.769 --> 28:50.979
It's fine.

28:51.062 --> 28:54.065
How long are they considering
for quarantine?

28:54.149 --> 28:55.442
We don't know.

28:55.525 --> 28:56.651
Yes, you do.

28:56.735 --> 28:57.652
We don't.

28:57.736 --> 29:00.947
They don't know what this is,
so they don't know the incubation period.

29:01.030 --> 29:04.367
From what I hear,
they're thinking a minimum of one month.

29:04.451 --> 29:07.203
What? That means we have
to be here for at least a month.

29:07.287 --> 29:08.955
Wait until you get tested.

29:09.038 --> 29:09.956
Wait a minute.

29:11.624 --> 29:12.751
Yes, sir.

29:12.834 --> 29:13.668
Well,

29:14.586 --> 29:15.754
I'm really sorry,

29:16.838 --> 29:19.340
but I have to get out of here.

29:20.967 --> 29:21.843
Sir.

29:22.594 --> 29:25.430
Even judges and prosecutors
are standing by and waiting.

29:25.513 --> 29:26.931
Connections don't work here.

29:27.015 --> 29:29.851
I know. I'm really sorry.

29:30.810 --> 29:32.729
-I sincerely apologize.
-For what?

29:40.153 --> 29:41.780
What are you going to do?

29:46.493 --> 29:47.702
What are you doing?

29:52.874 --> 29:56.169
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I have to get to the school.

29:56.252 --> 29:58.922
I said I'd follow the protocols
to help you.

29:59.005 --> 30:02.425
In the past, there were too many lives
I couldn't save due to those protocols.

30:08.598 --> 30:09.641
I'm going.

30:10.683 --> 30:14.020
Please help them
so they are not punished too severely.

30:15.230 --> 30:18.441
You created the mess,
but you want me to clean it up?

30:24.739 --> 30:26.241
You're a mother as well.

30:27.784 --> 30:28.660
And I'm a father.

30:38.127 --> 30:39.212
Hey.

30:39.295 --> 30:40.380
Why did you do that?

30:40.922 --> 30:42.674
He tried to get up.

30:44.759 --> 30:45.677
What should I do?

30:46.344 --> 30:47.887
Don't even think about coming.

30:49.138 --> 30:50.849
Stay after what I just did?

30:50.932 --> 30:51.766
You…

31:24.173 --> 31:26.301
We can't go this way.

31:40.148 --> 31:41.900
There are no kids in school uniforms.

31:43.735 --> 31:45.153
No one got out.

31:46.487 --> 31:47.739
No one was saved.

31:50.867 --> 31:51.743
No.

31:51.826 --> 31:53.119
It's not what it looks like.

31:53.202 --> 31:54.370
Move. Step back.

31:54.454 --> 31:55.538
I'm telling you it's not.

31:57.749 --> 31:58.583
Tell him.

31:58.666 --> 32:00.001
You weren't bitten by a zombie.

32:08.843 --> 32:10.094
Why won't you say anything?

32:11.137 --> 32:12.055
It wasn't a zombie.

32:13.598 --> 32:14.933
Gwi-nam bit her.

32:15.516 --> 32:16.517
Who?

32:16.601 --> 32:18.353
Gwi-nam. The bully.

32:18.436 --> 32:20.271
-Yoon Gwi-nam?
-Yes.

32:21.272 --> 32:24.192
Nam-ra. Were you really bitten by Gwi-nam?

32:27.320 --> 32:28.154
Say it clearly.

32:28.237 --> 32:29.739
It's true.

32:33.701 --> 32:35.536
Gwi-nam was bitten by zombies.

32:39.248 --> 32:41.334
What bullshit is that? Moron.

32:42.001 --> 32:43.044
I saw him get bit.

32:44.003 --> 32:45.797
If you get bitten by zombies, you turn.

32:45.880 --> 32:47.674
-So if Gwi-nam bit her--
-You're wrong!

32:50.134 --> 32:51.427
MUSIC ROOM

32:54.097 --> 32:55.264
Gwi-nam wasn't a zombie.

32:57.350 --> 32:58.643
He wasn't.

32:59.686 --> 33:01.145
He spoke. He recognized me.

33:02.063 --> 33:04.107
You saw. He wasn't a zombie.

33:07.819 --> 33:10.029
Are you sure he was bitten by a zombie?

33:10.113 --> 33:11.364
Yes.

33:12.824 --> 33:14.367
Then I'll turn into a zombie too.

33:15.702 --> 33:16.577
Stop that.

33:18.955 --> 33:20.164
I…

33:22.750 --> 33:24.252
Never mind. I'm leaving.

33:24.836 --> 33:26.921
Thanks, Su-hyeok.

33:29.090 --> 33:29.966
Hey, Prez.

33:36.097 --> 33:38.307
You never call me by my name.

33:47.775 --> 33:49.068
You're not one of them.

33:53.906 --> 33:55.366
She won't turn into a zombie.

33:55.908 --> 33:57.076
Don't you trust me?

33:59.162 --> 34:00.538
I saw Gwi-nam get bit.

34:01.789 --> 34:04.292
-It happened while we fought.
-I fought him too.

34:05.585 --> 34:06.544
That's how I know.

34:23.853 --> 34:24.854
See this?

34:26.355 --> 34:29.817
If she turns, I'll throw her
out the window so she can't attack you.

34:31.903 --> 34:33.196
So don't say anything.

34:33.279 --> 34:35.990
-Su-hyeok.
-Don't say anything, asshole.

34:38.076 --> 34:39.827
You don't need to do this.

34:41.412 --> 34:42.872
You stay quiet too.

34:51.172 --> 34:52.048
Don't come closer.

34:53.925 --> 34:55.301
I warned you.

34:56.844 --> 34:57.970
Screw you.

34:59.013 --> 35:00.306
I warned you first.

35:01.224 --> 35:02.183
Stay away.

35:02.266 --> 35:03.434
Gyeong-su was enough.

35:04.936 --> 35:06.437
I won't lose any more friends.

35:10.608 --> 35:12.568
-Get out of the way.
-I said stay away.

35:13.444 --> 35:14.862
I told you to stop it, fucker.

35:14.946 --> 35:16.155
Get out of my way!

35:16.239 --> 35:17.698
Stop it, both of you!

35:33.589 --> 35:35.049
If I feel strange at all…

35:39.512 --> 35:41.139
I'll make sure I die.

35:43.850 --> 35:44.725
I'm sorry, but--

35:44.809 --> 35:46.185
No need to be sorry.

35:48.396 --> 35:50.481
I'm not sorry towards any of you either.

35:53.151 --> 35:54.110
I'm sorry.

35:55.778 --> 35:56.654
Su-hyeok.

35:58.281 --> 35:59.532
Push me if I turn.

36:01.784 --> 36:02.827
Hey!

36:22.013 --> 36:23.222
That's enough.

36:23.973 --> 36:25.433
She should've turned by now.

36:26.475 --> 36:27.351
No.

36:28.144 --> 36:29.562
She was bitten by Gwi-nam.

36:30.313 --> 36:31.564
She should be fine.

36:32.273 --> 36:33.900
He was bitten by zombies.

36:35.318 --> 36:36.652
Su-hyeok says he wasn't one.

36:38.029 --> 36:39.488
I saw it with my own eyes.

36:39.989 --> 36:41.782
Su-hyeok has no reason to lie.

36:42.366 --> 36:43.951
And I do?

36:44.577 --> 36:45.661
Still, Su-hyeok--

36:45.745 --> 36:47.663
I know you like him,

36:47.747 --> 36:49.790
but this is a different matter.

36:53.085 --> 36:54.587
Why are you bringing that up now?

36:56.380 --> 36:58.007
Stop taking his side all the time.

37:00.843 --> 37:01.969
I am not--

37:02.053 --> 37:03.262
Yes, you are.

37:25.576 --> 37:26.661
Does it hurt a lot?

37:27.954 --> 37:31.040
I said we shouldn't come out!

37:31.123 --> 37:32.959
I said we would all die!

37:33.459 --> 37:36.545
We stopped the bleeding.
You'll be fine when you get to a hospital.

37:36.629 --> 37:39.382
How can I go to a hospital right now?

37:39.465 --> 37:40.633
Damn it.

37:40.716 --> 37:42.468
Yes, you can. Don't worry.

37:42.551 --> 37:45.513
It's all your fault. It's your fault.

37:45.596 --> 37:47.515
Stop whining. You won't die.

37:52.186 --> 37:54.063
Hey. No luck?

37:58.609 --> 38:01.279
See? I told you it wouldn't work.

38:01.362 --> 38:03.572
Stop it already! You're not dying!

38:29.598 --> 38:30.683
Su-hyeok.

38:31.767 --> 38:33.227
Su-hyeok.

38:34.395 --> 38:36.897
I feel weird. I'm hungry.

38:41.902 --> 38:42.945
Su-hyeok.

38:44.780 --> 38:46.782
Why do you smell so good?

38:57.501 --> 38:58.336
Nam-ra.

39:00.504 --> 39:01.422
Su-hyeok!

39:24.737 --> 39:25.780
Get out of the way!

39:25.863 --> 39:27.823
-Don't do it.
-Move!

39:30.868 --> 39:32.203
I told you to stop, fuck.

39:32.286 --> 39:33.329
You moron.

39:39.210 --> 39:41.629
Hey. Cut it out. Stop it already!

39:41.712 --> 39:43.589
-Let go of me!
-They're going to come in!

39:44.423 --> 39:45.383
-Let go!
-Don't do it!

39:45.466 --> 39:47.802
-Watch out, On-jo!
-Get out of my way! Let go of me!

39:48.386 --> 39:50.971
Stop it. Are you blind?
Can't you see Nam-ra?

39:51.722 --> 39:53.891
She would have blood on her mouth
if she bit him.

40:00.523 --> 40:01.649
Did you see it?

40:02.775 --> 40:04.360
Is he bleeding? No, right?

40:04.443 --> 40:06.237
She's right. There's no wound.

40:07.738 --> 40:09.657
But if Gwi-nam bit her--

40:09.740 --> 40:11.659
She's still fine so she's okay.

40:16.497 --> 40:17.665
Put that down.

40:19.792 --> 40:20.918
Stop being so stubborn.

40:27.383 --> 40:28.509
Let go.

40:29.385 --> 40:31.429
I got it so let go.

40:34.348 --> 40:35.558
Why won't you drop that?

40:37.143 --> 40:38.436
None of your business.

40:53.826 --> 40:54.785
You're okay, right?

40:55.995 --> 40:58.247
-Why are you taking my side?
-What?

40:59.623 --> 41:00.624
It's weird.

41:01.876 --> 41:03.127
You hated me.

41:07.756 --> 41:08.883
I still do.

41:11.469 --> 41:12.887
But what's wrong is wrong.

41:19.685 --> 41:23.272
She seems fine. Let's…

41:23.355 --> 41:25.274
She should've turned by now.

41:25.900 --> 41:26.734
No.

41:31.197 --> 41:34.742
I'm not okay. I wanted to bite Su-hyeok.

41:34.825 --> 41:36.035
That's not true.

41:37.203 --> 41:38.078
Stop that.

41:38.162 --> 41:39.914
No, I really did.

41:41.248 --> 41:42.750
I wanted to bite him.

41:43.334 --> 41:44.627
What do you mean?

41:45.336 --> 41:46.295
That's all.

41:49.465 --> 41:50.549
I wanted to bite him.

41:57.473 --> 41:59.975
I don't think I should stay with you guys.

42:00.059 --> 42:02.478
If I hadn't come to my senses,
I would've bit him.

42:02.561 --> 42:04.647
Hey, stop that. What's wrong with you?

42:08.150 --> 42:09.151
I'll go.

42:09.235 --> 42:10.528
Wait.

42:13.030 --> 42:15.157
Did you see Gwi-nam get bitten by zombies?

42:15.241 --> 42:16.659
How many times must I tell you?

42:16.742 --> 42:18.410
Did you see him turn?

42:19.662 --> 42:20.496
No, I didn't.

42:21.413 --> 42:22.456
I was busy running away.

42:24.875 --> 42:27.628
Su-hyeok, you definitely fought Gwi-nam?

42:28.212 --> 42:30.172
Yes, I did.

42:32.341 --> 42:34.468
There's no reason
for either of you to lie.

42:35.177 --> 42:37.513
Maybe Gwi-nam was bitten but didn't turn.

42:38.097 --> 42:40.849
In the movies,
there are people who are immune.

42:42.434 --> 42:43.936
Still, she tried to bite him.

42:45.104 --> 42:46.230
And she could have.

42:47.856 --> 42:49.692
Regardless, she isn't normal.

42:50.276 --> 42:51.902
I can't be with her.

42:51.986 --> 42:53.028
Ji-min.

42:53.112 --> 42:55.030
What? Am I wrong?

42:58.284 --> 42:59.201
I don't know.

43:01.662 --> 43:03.163
I don't know what we should do.

43:03.789 --> 43:05.291
So? What do you want us to do?

43:05.958 --> 43:06.792
Please.

43:11.213 --> 43:12.673
Don't fight.

43:18.762 --> 43:20.472
If I leave, it'll solve everything.

43:25.728 --> 43:29.315
Don't go. Where would you go? Stop it.

43:29.398 --> 43:30.232
Please.

43:33.736 --> 43:35.738
Let's not let anyone else die.

43:43.537 --> 43:44.788
Hyeon-ju and I-sak's hands

43:45.706 --> 43:47.625
were very cold before they turned.

43:51.253 --> 43:52.463
Nam-ra's hands are warm.

43:53.088 --> 43:54.131
She isn't a zombie.

43:55.049 --> 43:57.301
So let's just talk about
how to get to the roof.

43:57.384 --> 43:59.094
-No.
-Ji-min!

43:59.178 --> 44:00.262
No!

44:01.055 --> 44:04.433
She may be fine now,
but who knows when she'll turn?

44:05.309 --> 44:08.228
The rest of you say something.
This is wrong.

44:08.312 --> 44:10.564
She said so herself
that she wanted to bite him.

44:10.648 --> 44:12.775
She has zombie blood flowing in her veins!

44:13.734 --> 44:15.319
Zombies killed my mom and dad.

44:16.820 --> 44:18.113
My innocent mom…

44:33.629 --> 44:34.546
Hey.

44:36.298 --> 44:37.466
Give me your hand.

44:38.509 --> 44:40.594
-What are you doing?
-Tying our hands together.

44:41.887 --> 44:43.764
Stop it. Stop.

44:47.309 --> 44:48.477
Stop it.

45:01.740 --> 45:03.992
Happy? She can't go to you
even if she turns.

45:06.912 --> 45:08.205
She can only bite me.

45:29.935 --> 45:31.687
What do you plan to do?

45:31.770 --> 45:32.813
I have to leave.

45:33.897 --> 45:35.399
It won't take long on that.

45:42.865 --> 45:44.616
I don't think it'll start.

45:44.700 --> 45:47.745
Why are you so damn pessimistic?

45:47.828 --> 45:50.914
The one earlier was in an accident.
That one's obviously fine.

45:51.665 --> 45:53.459
How can two people ride that?

45:54.543 --> 45:55.419
Three.

45:58.046 --> 45:59.757
You're really taking the baby?

46:00.340 --> 46:03.385
If we leave the baby here, it'll die.

46:11.143 --> 46:12.227
Here.

46:12.311 --> 46:13.437
Sit in the back

46:13.520 --> 46:15.522
and beat up anyone who gets close.

46:16.690 --> 46:18.192
I can't go. No way.

46:18.275 --> 46:21.528
You bastard.
I'll report you for desertion.

46:23.280 --> 46:24.406
Fine, go ahead.

46:25.324 --> 46:29.328
Given the situation, the court will agree
these were extenuating circumstances.

46:29.411 --> 46:32.080
-Court? Extenuating circumstances?
-Yes.

46:33.457 --> 46:34.541
You're pretty smart.

46:34.625 --> 46:36.460
Yes, I am. I go to Seoul University.

46:36.543 --> 46:39.421
Okay, then.
I'll break all the windows on my way out

46:39.505 --> 46:40.839
so that they can get in.

46:44.301 --> 46:45.302
No!

46:50.974 --> 46:52.017
Damn it.

46:52.684 --> 46:53.685
Let's go.

46:54.311 --> 46:56.355
A person should use his head.

46:56.438 --> 46:59.483
We need to stay alive
to tell someone about the laptop.

46:59.566 --> 47:03.487
CHEONGSAN CHICKEN

47:05.781 --> 47:07.282
-What's that?
-Help!

47:07.366 --> 47:10.077
-Hey.
-Help!

47:10.160 --> 47:11.036
Come here!

47:26.093 --> 47:28.220
We should've just gone when we decided to!

47:29.263 --> 47:31.431
Are you going
to save everyone in the world?

47:31.515 --> 47:33.267
-Are you an angel?
-I'm a detective.

47:33.350 --> 47:34.351
Damn it.

47:38.230 --> 47:39.731
-Take the baby.
-Okay.

47:43.485 --> 47:44.444
Are you okay?

47:45.279 --> 47:46.280
Are you hurt?

47:47.865 --> 47:48.949
Mommy.

47:50.576 --> 47:54.204
-Mommy is over there.
-Where?

47:54.913 --> 47:55.914
Where's your mommy?

47:59.167 --> 48:00.252
Is…

48:00.335 --> 48:01.753
is that your mommy?

48:02.963 --> 48:04.006
The one wearing red?

48:09.845 --> 48:13.682
Sir. I don't know how to hold babies,

48:14.600 --> 48:16.310
but this baby keeps smiling at me.

48:16.393 --> 48:18.145
-Wait a minute.
-What do I do?

48:20.188 --> 48:21.607
Stay still for a minute.

48:38.373 --> 48:39.541
Fuck.

48:41.627 --> 48:43.295
What's wrong with this world?

49:09.279 --> 49:10.447
It'll all be okay.

49:11.615 --> 49:14.785
Hey. If she's immune,
does that mean she's okay

49:15.452 --> 49:16.954
even if she gets bitten?

49:17.037 --> 49:18.413
Probably.

49:18.997 --> 49:20.874
Fuck. I'm so jealous.

49:21.625 --> 49:24.002
But she still has zombie blood
flowing in her veins.

49:24.753 --> 49:26.380
She isn't completely a zombie.

49:27.714 --> 49:28.966
A hambie?

49:29.049 --> 49:30.175
What's a hambie?

49:30.258 --> 49:31.468
Half zombie?

49:31.551 --> 49:32.427
What the hell?

49:32.511 --> 49:33.887
It's like half-half.

49:33.971 --> 49:35.305
Like half spicy, half fried…

49:35.847 --> 49:38.266
-I want fried chicken.
-Stop it.

49:38.850 --> 49:40.644
We haven't even had water for two days.

49:40.727 --> 49:43.563
Is it true we'll die
if we don't have water for three days?

49:45.148 --> 49:47.317
I don't know.
Don't talk to me. I'm hungry.

49:47.401 --> 49:51.321
Dae-su, don't you want
that soda we had on our way to school?

49:53.699 --> 49:55.367
-Aren't you dying for it?
-Yes.

49:57.077 --> 49:59.454
I want Hot Six with Pocari.

50:00.372 --> 50:05.168
I'll see your soda, Hot Six, and Pocari
and raise you an iced vanilla latte.

50:05.252 --> 50:07.546
How could you think about food
with a zombie right here?

50:07.629 --> 50:10.007
Stop it. Nam-ra isn't a zombie.

50:10.090 --> 50:10.966
Hambie.

50:11.049 --> 50:12.175
That's still a zombie.

50:12.259 --> 50:13.969
Let's not do that among ourselves.

50:15.095 --> 50:16.346
We're all we have.

50:17.097 --> 50:20.183
She's right. Prez is better than Na-yeon.

50:20.267 --> 50:22.769
Don't even say her name. She's subhuman.

50:23.353 --> 50:26.565
Gyeong-su died because of her,
and Ms. Park…

50:26.648 --> 50:27.649
That's true.

50:28.567 --> 50:31.862
If it weren't for Na-yeon,
they'd still be with us.

50:33.363 --> 50:34.448
That's right.

50:34.531 --> 50:37.826
The PTA asked the parents
to send stuff before the competition

50:37.909 --> 50:39.995
and asked my mom to send some chicken.

50:40.078 --> 50:40.996
Chicken?

50:41.079 --> 50:44.207
We would've seen it if it were here.

50:44.291 --> 50:45.751
There's nothing here.

50:47.878 --> 50:48.712
Hold on.

50:51.298 --> 50:52.674
Fuck. Maybe it's in here.

50:53.258 --> 50:54.092
Hey.

50:54.176 --> 50:55.886
-What?
-We don't know what's in there.

50:55.969 --> 50:58.055
We need to eat and survive first.

50:59.681 --> 51:02.893
-Fuck. It's locked.
-It's locked, damn it.

51:06.104 --> 51:07.272
Let's open it.

51:07.939 --> 51:09.399
Find something to open it.

51:09.483 --> 51:12.152
-Hurry.
-Look for something. Hurry.

51:23.997 --> 51:25.290
What do you think?

51:25.373 --> 51:28.210
-That wall is our only way out, right?
-That's our best option.

51:29.753 --> 51:31.963
Security is insane.
We're completely trapped.

51:32.464 --> 51:35.175
-Let's go over it.
-Are you sure? We'll be seen for sure.

51:36.510 --> 51:37.719
That's the only way.

51:37.803 --> 51:44.768
RESTRICTED AREA
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

52:17.008 --> 52:18.385
-What?
-Rope.

52:20.804 --> 52:22.389
Drop me a rope.

52:27.519 --> 52:29.146
-U-sin.
-Yes?

52:30.063 --> 52:31.148
My God.

52:32.274 --> 52:33.358
Stay alive.

52:33.984 --> 52:35.694
What are you doing? Take me with you.

52:37.279 --> 52:39.489
Captain!

52:41.950 --> 52:42.993
Captain!

52:47.747 --> 52:48.623
Freeze.

52:49.499 --> 52:50.333
Freeze!

52:51.376 --> 52:52.669
What are you doing?

52:55.380 --> 52:56.548
Stop right there.

52:57.257 --> 52:58.216
What the hell?

52:58.884 --> 53:00.051
I told you not to move!

53:00.135 --> 53:01.761
I'm on patrol, punk.

53:04.431 --> 53:06.683
Which unit are you with?

53:06.766 --> 53:07.726
Sorry.

53:08.476 --> 53:09.311
Pardon?

53:28.121 --> 53:29.080
It won't work?

53:30.332 --> 53:31.458
Should we knock it down?

53:36.463 --> 53:37.339
Damn it.

53:38.006 --> 53:40.884
PTA DONATIONS

53:46.598 --> 53:48.016
Hey. Take it easy.

53:56.775 --> 53:58.610
Hey. Keep it down! Quiet!

54:00.695 --> 54:01.613
Hey.

54:02.113 --> 54:03.198
Stop it.

54:07.953 --> 54:08.828
It won't work.

54:09.537 --> 54:10.747
What a waste of energy.

54:20.173 --> 54:21.967
Don't play any music either.

54:46.491 --> 54:47.909
My mom and dad…

54:50.370 --> 54:52.706
came to the school to save me,

54:55.041 --> 54:56.084
but the cops…

54:58.628 --> 55:00.130
and firefighters never came.

55:03.133 --> 55:05.260
If anyone sees this later,

55:05.969 --> 55:07.387
please punish

55:08.430 --> 55:09.931
everyone who should have come.

55:12.350 --> 55:13.727
Everyone abandoned us.

55:15.061 --> 55:15.979
All of them.

55:18.481 --> 55:20.191
I swear I'll make you pay.

55:32.245 --> 55:33.121
Mom.

55:35.373 --> 55:36.291
Dad.

55:40.295 --> 55:42.255
I'll stay alive and get revenge.

55:45.550 --> 55:47.260
I'll get revenge on the zombies…

55:50.263 --> 55:51.806
and everyone else, Mom.

56:18.208 --> 56:19.209
Mom.

56:20.418 --> 56:21.294
Dad.

56:22.379 --> 56:23.296
Hi.

56:25.340 --> 56:28.885
I'm fine. The kids are really good to me.

56:30.637 --> 56:32.305
Want to see them?

56:40.897 --> 56:41.731
Well…

56:44.651 --> 56:45.777
Mom, Dad…

56:48.863 --> 56:50.031
I miss you.

56:51.991 --> 56:53.201
I miss you.

56:55.370 --> 56:56.496
And…

56:58.915 --> 57:00.417
I'm so sorry.

57:09.634 --> 57:11.302
Give it to me too.

57:22.313 --> 57:23.189
Mom.

57:23.940 --> 57:25.358
I want a raise in my allowance.

57:28.736 --> 57:30.238
-Is it ready to go?
-Yes.

57:32.907 --> 57:36.202
Music and lyrics
by intergalactic superstar Yang Dae-su.

57:37.537 --> 57:38.371
Beat.

57:40.915 --> 57:44.127
Chicken tastes better fried in olive oil

57:44.627 --> 57:47.964
Pork tastes better than soy meat

57:48.047 --> 57:51.259
Strawberry cake tastes better
Than plain strawberries

57:51.342 --> 57:54.929
What makes me laugh, laugh, laugh

57:55.013 --> 57:56.389
Is trans fat

57:56.473 --> 57:57.515
Cheong-san?

58:13.490 --> 58:14.324
Mom.

58:16.534 --> 58:17.410
It's me.

58:18.453 --> 58:19.913
Dad, you're okay too, right?

58:22.415 --> 58:23.291
I'm…

58:25.376 --> 58:26.544
I'm doing okay.

58:52.862 --> 58:53.696
Hi, Dad.

58:54.948 --> 58:55.907
You're okay, right?

58:57.534 --> 58:59.744
I waited for you all night,
but you didn't come,

58:59.827 --> 59:01.496
so we're trying our best to hang on.

59:02.997 --> 59:07.043
You said being healthy is the best
even if I don't get good grades.

59:15.510 --> 59:18.429
You said you'd come first
if anything happened.

59:21.516 --> 59:23.142
You're okay, right?

59:31.901 --> 59:33.736
You have to be okay, Dad.

59:34.529 --> 59:36.573
You don't have to come save me.

59:42.870 --> 59:44.831
But still, I wish you'd come.

59:49.252 --> 59:52.839
I really thought you would come.

1:00:10.231 --> 1:00:11.858
But I'm okay.

1:00:17.530 --> 1:00:19.824
I only say this
when you give me my allowance,

1:00:22.452 --> 1:00:24.078
but I'll say it for free today.

1:00:26.706 --> 1:00:27.665
Dad.

1:00:29.542 --> 1:00:30.501
I love you.

1:00:35.089 --> 1:00:36.215
I love you.

1:00:39.636 --> 1:00:41.387
I love you so much.

1:04:43.170 --> 1:04:45.631

LOCATIONS, INSTITUTIONS,
