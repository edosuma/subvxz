So, how you feeling today?

07:24.000 --> 07:25.584
Life's a trip.

07:25.584 --> 07:27.125
Yeah, life is a big trip.

07:27.125 --> 07:28.792
When you left,

07:28.834 --> 07:30.709
all of a sudden,

07:30.751 --> 07:33.209
the topic of vacation came up

07:33.250 --> 07:35.959
and then nima was like "Belize"

07:35.959 --> 07:37.292
and then I think everyone got

07:37.292 --> 07:39.125
on the Belize bandwagon.

07:39.167 --> 07:40.834
So, I was calling

07:40.834 --> 07:42.459
to tell you two things.

07:42.501 --> 07:43.834
One, I wanna invite you

07:43.834 --> 07:45.167
to Belize.

07:45.209 --> 07:46.584
I'm in, let's do it.

07:46.626 --> 07:48.959
And two, I wanted to tell you

07:49.000 --> 07:51.959
that I am having dinner

07:52.000 --> 07:54.542
with your wife, just me and her.

07:56.292 --> 07:58.584
I'm gonna invite her to Belize.

07:58.626 --> 08:00.209
No, I'm not down with that.

08:00.209 --> 08:01.792
You're...

08:01.834 --> 08:02.959
Down with what?

08:03.000 --> 08:04.167
- Reza's not trying.
- To be malicious,

08:04.167 --> 08:05.459
He's trying to help, right?

08:05.501 --> 08:06.501
You're not down with me

08:06.542 --> 08:07.959
having dinner with your wife?

08:08.000 --> 08:10.501
Nope. But if my friends

08:10.501 --> 08:11.751
would not get involved,

08:11.792 --> 08:12.792
it would make things

08:12.792 --> 08:13.792
a lot easier for me.

08:13.834 --> 08:15.083
I'm not interested

08:15.083 --> 08:16.334
in sitting down

08:16.334 --> 08:18.626
for a Mike-bashing session.

08:18.667 --> 08:20.250
I'm not here to like,

08:20.292 --> 08:21.292
get involved

08:21.292 --> 08:22.292
in y'all's relationship,

08:22.334 --> 08:23.667
I'm coming to invite

08:23.667 --> 08:24.959
your wife to Belize,

08:25.000 --> 08:27.042
that's it, okay?

08:27.042 --> 08:28.042
And I'll call you as soon

08:28.042 --> 08:29.042
as we're done.

08:29.083 --> 08:30.876
Okay, don't worry. Bye.

08:30.876 --> 08:31.959
Hey.

08:31.959 --> 08:33.042
Hi, how are you?

08:33.042 --> 08:34.209
Good, how are you?

08:34.209 --> 08:35.375
Good.

08:35.375 --> 08:38.042
You look so nice.

08:38.042 --> 08:39.375
Good to see you,

08:39.375 --> 08:40.709
good to see you.

08:40.751 --> 08:42.792
- Everywhere I go now,
- the first question I ask is,

08:42.834 --> 08:45.209
"Is there alcohol here?"

08:45.209 --> 08:46.209
I know, I'm like,

08:46.209 --> 08:47.209
where's our server?

08:47.209 --> 08:48.501
I need a drink.

08:48.542 --> 08:50.042
- Literally, that's.
- The first thing I ask now,

08:50.042 --> 08:51.209
It's really bad.

08:51.250 --> 08:53.375
- Yeah, I just got off the phone.
- With your husband.

08:55.542 --> 08:56.876
- Hi.
- Hi guys, how are you?

08:56.918 --> 08:58.000
- Can I get you anything?
- We'd love to order.

08:58.042 --> 08:59.375
- Some drinks, please.
- Okay.

08:59.375 --> 09:01.709
- Can I please.
- Get a grey goose dirty Martini?

09:01.709 --> 09:03.876
- And I'll do a maker's mark.
- And ginger ale, please,

09:03.876 --> 09:04.876
With lots of lime.

09:04.918 --> 09:06.083
Thank you, Julia.

09:10.250 --> 09:11.584
So, after you left

09:11.584 --> 09:12.918
the fashion show,

09:12.959 --> 09:14.918
we started talking about like,

09:14.959 --> 09:16.167
we... everyone needs a trip.

09:16.209 --> 09:18.334
- Asa's like, "I need a trip,
- I'm worn out."

09:18.375 --> 09:20.209
So, we were throwing places out

09:20.250 --> 09:22.083
and nima suggested Belize

09:22.125 --> 09:24.083
- and a lot of people.
- Got on board with that.

09:24.083 --> 09:26.918
So, I was wondering

09:26.959 --> 09:28.542
if you would join us

09:28.584 --> 09:30.834
for a little trip to Belize.

09:30.876 --> 09:33.751
I think it would do both of you

09:33.751 --> 09:35.375
a lot of good mentally,

09:35.417 --> 09:38.375
just not to be here.

09:43.417 --> 09:46.000
I have to be really honest

09:46.042 --> 09:47.584
and I haven't been honest

09:47.584 --> 09:49.125
at all.

09:51.459 --> 09:53.083
- I don't think.
- I'm gonna go back to him.

09:53.125 --> 09:54.501
Why?

10:09.292 --> 10:10.542
I don't think

10:10.542 --> 10:11.792
I'm gonna go back to him.

10:11.792 --> 10:13.167
Why?

10:14.292 --> 10:15.959
He cheated on me

10:15.959 --> 10:17.584
and he's making up

10:17.626 --> 10:19.250
every excuse in the world

10:19.292 --> 10:21.083
as to why I left.

10:22.626 --> 10:23.834
I don't wanna ask,

10:23.834 --> 10:25.042
like, details and stuff

10:25.083 --> 10:26.584
because I don't wanna pry

10:26.626 --> 10:28.125
into your personal life.

10:28.125 --> 10:30.542
Are you a hundred percent sure?

10:30.584 --> 10:32.501
- Like, is it rumor and innuendo,
- no.

10:32.501 --> 10:33.501
- Because there's a lot of...
- I saw proof.

10:33.501 --> 10:34.667
Crap around us.

10:34.667 --> 10:35.667
This was the first time

10:35.667 --> 10:36.667
I saw proof

10:36.709 --> 10:38.501
with my own two eyes.

10:38.501 --> 10:39.667
I'm not surprised

10:39.667 --> 10:41.667
but Mike is an admitted ho,

10:41.667 --> 10:43.125
maybe a reformed ho.

10:43.167 --> 10:44.459
I know that he tells me

10:44.501 --> 10:46.167
- he's only putting.
- His ding-a-ling.

10:46.167 --> 10:47.834
In one spot right now,

10:47.876 --> 10:49.667
but he does talk about,

10:49.667 --> 10:51.000
you know,

10:51.000 --> 10:52.334
missing that whole life.

10:52.334 --> 10:55.125
Reza, for five years

10:55.167 --> 10:57.125
- he told me everything.
- Was a rumor.

10:57.167 --> 10:59.000
- Everyone was talking.
- And I was ignoring it,

10:59.000 --> 11:00.792
- Standing by his side.
- Because I trusted my husband.

11:00.834 --> 11:02.667
- And I trusted.
- What he told me was real.

11:02.667 --> 11:04.000
- Right.
- But now I'm married.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.959
- And six months later,
- this is happening.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.125
- Right.
- Right now,

11:07.167 --> 11:09.167
I feel really confused.

11:10.626 --> 11:11.834
I still love Mike

11:11.834 --> 11:13.000
and I always will love Mike.

11:13.042 --> 11:14.459
I keep wanting to wake up

11:14.459 --> 11:15.876
and think it's like a nightmare,

11:15.918 --> 11:18.000
but it's real.

11:22.042 --> 11:23.292
Until and if

11:23.292 --> 11:24.542
I can get past this

11:24.584 --> 11:26.876
in my mind,

11:26.918 --> 11:29.042
I can't move back home.

11:29.042 --> 11:30.459
I guess you have to figure out

11:30.501 --> 11:32.542
- if it's what you want anymore.
- Right.

11:32.542 --> 11:34.542
- Because from the way.
- He makes it sound,

11:34.542 --> 11:37.042
He's willing to put in the work.

11:37.042 --> 11:38.417
Like, he's looking for advice

11:38.417 --> 11:39.792
and direction.

11:39.834 --> 11:41.542
- Hey, I'm sorry to interrupt.
- Your drinks are coming.

11:41.542 --> 11:42.626
- Cool.
- Are you ready to order food?

11:42.667 --> 11:43.876
- Let's order some appetizers...
- Sure.

11:43.876 --> 11:45.209
Or something.

11:45.209 --> 11:46.375
- Can we get.
- The chicken tenders,

11:46.375 --> 11:48.334
- The buffalo ones?
- Sure.

11:48.375 --> 11:49.709
Can we get the hummus plate?

11:49.751 --> 11:50.876
And some waters, please.

11:50.876 --> 11:52.167
Sure.

11:52.167 --> 11:53.459
Thank you.

11:53.501 --> 11:55.918
You know what's best for you.

11:55.918 --> 11:57.417
I'm not gonna assume

11:57.417 --> 11:58.876
that I have

11:58.918 --> 12:01.083
any, like, Sage advice.

12:01.083 --> 12:02.167
I didn't know that

12:02.167 --> 12:03.250
that was going on.

12:03.250 --> 12:04.709
Thank you.

12:04.751 --> 12:06.250
He's a little bit of a dog,

12:06.292 --> 12:07.751
but I know that he loves you.

12:07.751 --> 12:09.167
He's just...

12:09.167 --> 12:10.542
He's very stupid.

12:10.584 --> 12:11.709
- He's...
- A little rough.

12:11.751 --> 12:13.584
- Around the edges.
- Yeah, he's nitpicky,

12:13.626 --> 12:15.334
He's controlling.

12:15.375 --> 12:16.501
You can put it here.

12:16.542 --> 12:18.459
Oh, the most.

12:20.542 --> 12:22.083
- You just gotta crack.
- The whip on him.

12:22.083 --> 12:24.042
I should've trained him sooner.

12:24.083 --> 12:25.876
- So when you told him.
- You were hanging out with me,

12:25.918 --> 12:27.584
What did he say?

12:27.626 --> 12:29.042
I cannot talk to him

12:29.042 --> 12:30.417
about any of this, by the way,

12:30.459 --> 12:31.542
because my hope

12:31.542 --> 12:32.584
is that you guys

12:32.584 --> 12:34.250
end up getting back together

12:34.292 --> 12:36.751
and because he is a hot-head

12:36.792 --> 12:38.542
and he cares about

12:38.542 --> 12:40.292
what people think way too much.

12:40.292 --> 12:41.459
I'm gonna tell him

12:41.459 --> 12:42.626
we had a great conversation,

12:42.667 --> 12:44.292
that's all I'm gonna say.

12:44.292 --> 12:45.918
Is that okay with you?

12:47.000 --> 12:48.375
And you're gonna think

12:48.375 --> 12:49.751
about Belize.

12:53.959 --> 12:55.542
I'll think about it.

12:55.584 --> 12:56.584
Thank you.

12:58.959 --> 13:00.501
You look stunning.

13:01.667 --> 13:03.250
- Do you.
- I did a little turn for you.

13:03.292 --> 13:05.125
- I love it. I love it.
- Goodnight.

13:05.167 --> 13:06.334
Thank you.

13:18.167 --> 13:19.250
Hi.

13:19.250 --> 13:20.334
Let me just tell you,

13:20.334 --> 13:21.834
nothing went down.

13:21.834 --> 13:23.000
It was all good,

13:23.000 --> 13:24.167
I invited her to Belize.

13:24.167 --> 13:26.334
- She said she was gonna think.
- About it.

13:26.334 --> 13:28.000
- You don't have anything.
- To worry about.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.125
She loves you,

13:29.125 --> 13:30.250
she's just hurt,

13:30.292 --> 13:31.501
she's trying

13:31.501 --> 13:32.667
to figure out her sh...

13:32.667 --> 13:34.167
And you've gotta let her have

13:34.209 --> 13:35.667
that space and that time.

13:35.667 --> 13:36.834
Yeah, I've got to work

13:36.834 --> 13:38.000
on that.

13:38.042 --> 13:39.375
Mike's spiraling

13:39.375 --> 13:40.667
out of control

13:40.667 --> 13:42.167
and he does not see

13:42.167 --> 13:43.667
all of the blessings

13:43.709 --> 13:46.501
and the positivity in his life.

13:46.542 --> 13:48.501
- I think that.
- If he got Jessica back,

13:48.501 --> 13:50.083
He would have a better

13:50.083 --> 13:51.626
perspective on his life.

13:51.667 --> 13:54.250
Are you still coming to Belize?

13:54.292 --> 13:55.751
I guess so.

13:55.792 --> 13:57.083
And if it's not good,

13:57.083 --> 13:58.334
I'll get us a private jet

13:58.375 --> 14:00.459
and I'll fly me and you

14:00.459 --> 14:02.542
out of there, the rest of those

14:02.542 --> 14:04.167
- fools... the rest of those fools.
- Can stay,

14:04.209 --> 14:05.209
How about that?

14:05.209 --> 14:07.042
- All right, man.
- Okay.

14:07.042 --> 14:08.667
- I love you, Mikey,
- I'll talk to you later.

14:08.709 --> 14:09.709
- Love you man.
- Bye.

14:09.709 --> 14:10.834
Bye, bye.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
[Music playing]

14:21.751 --> 14:23.542
- Hey.
- Honey, I think today.

14:23.542 --> 14:25.709
Might be the hottest day

14:25.751 --> 14:27.876
of the year for me personally.

14:27.918 --> 14:29.501
I look like I just dove

14:29.501 --> 14:31.042
into a swimming pool

14:31.083 --> 14:32.709
of my own sweat.

14:32.709 --> 14:34.709
I'm having like, a bad hair day,

14:34.709 --> 14:36.042
a bad makeup day.

14:36.042 --> 14:37.542
I don't know, I'm about

14:37.542 --> 14:39.042
to go get my lashes done though

14:39.083 --> 14:40.501
with golnesa, actually.

14:40.542 --> 14:41.542
So...

14:41.584 --> 14:43.000
Good luck with that.

14:43.042 --> 14:44.918
- After the fashion show,
- Adam and I,

14:44.918 --> 14:46.417
We started googling

14:46.417 --> 14:47.918
rheumatoid arthritis

14:47.918 --> 14:50.918
and sh...'s not adding up.

14:50.918 --> 14:52.584
Yeah, she's just now gone

14:52.584 --> 14:54.209
to this doctor

14:54.250 --> 14:55.876
for blood tests

14:55.918 --> 14:57.876
- to find out.
- What treatment options,

14:57.918 --> 14:59.000
Not that all

14:59.000 --> 15:00.083
the treatment options

15:00.125 --> 15:01.542
should even be classified

15:01.542 --> 15:02.918
as "chemo."

15:02.918 --> 15:04.209
So what's going on?

15:04.250 --> 15:05.709
They're gonna do like,

15:05.751 --> 15:07.209
extractions out of my knee

15:08.250 --> 15:10.000
- -okay.
- And the second part.

15:10.042 --> 15:12.501
Is me starting the chemo.

15:12.542 --> 15:13.959
Golnesa has been telling us

15:13.959 --> 15:15.375
that she's gonna start

15:15.417 --> 15:16.751
chemotherapy today.

15:16.751 --> 15:18.334

18:55.375 --> 18:56.667
simple blood test.

19:09.876 --> 19:11.667
- which just means that.
- When they measure it,

- If there's a gap,
- it fills the gap.

19:13.167 --> 19:14.501

- That there's a gap.

19:14.542 --> 19:15.751

29:38.417 --> 29:39.459
Yeah.

29:39.459 --> 29:41.375
Oh, wow.

29:41.417 --> 29:42.417
Mine is not this big at all.

29:42.459 --> 29:44.459
This is so cute.

29:44.501 --> 29:46.042
- Where are we gonna eat.
- Tonight?

29:46.083 --> 29:47.459
- In the restaurant right here.
- Okay.

29:47.501 --> 29:49.584
- Isn't that cool to wake up.
- Naked, ahh.

29:49.626 --> 29:51.375
- I don't want flies.
- Coming in here.

29:51.417 --> 29:52.792
- Put on some bug spray.
- There's already a bug.

29:52.792 --> 29:54.167
Just flew in.

29:54.167 --> 29:55.542
Well, that's gonna happen.

29:55.584 --> 29:58.584
[Music playing]

30:01.501 --> 30:03.918
Hello?

30:03.959 --> 30:05.959
Salam.

30:05.959 --> 30:07.959
Get in.

30:09.125 --> 30:10.334
- Okay.
- What are you looking at?

30:10.334 --> 30:11.417
I'm looking at everybody.

30:11.459 --> 30:12.584
No.

30:12.626 --> 30:13.834
- Get in the water.
- Hey, Reza.

30:13.834 --> 30:15.667
- Huh?
- I'd like to talk to you.

30:15.667 --> 30:16.834
- Though, in private.
- I would love to talk to you.

30:16.834 --> 30:18.167
I don't need an audience.

30:18.167 --> 30:19.501
Let's go.

30:19.542 --> 30:20.584
I'm gonna take a nap

30:20.584 --> 30:21.626
on her ass.

30:22.792 --> 30:24.167
Come on.

30:24.167 --> 30:25.167
Reza and I made a deal

30:25.167 --> 30:26.167
when we were camping

30:26.167 --> 30:28.167
- that if we ever have an issue.
- With each other,

30:28.209 --> 30:29.584
We would sit and talk

30:29.626 --> 30:30.959
face to face about it.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.459
- Why don't you put.
- Some shoes on?

30:36.000 --> 30:37.584
I'm gonna be very, very real

30:37.626 --> 30:38.667
- with you.
- Okay.

30:38.667 --> 30:39.667
- A hundred percent.
- Real with you.

30:39.709 --> 30:41.375
Go ahead.

30:41.375 --> 30:43.042
Part of me didn't wanna come

30:43.042 --> 30:44.959
- because when I got.
- This information,

30:45.000 --> 30:47.709
I was so, like,

30:47.709 --> 30:49.000
wow.

30:49.042 --> 30:51.209
It was that you're saying

30:51.209 --> 30:54.334
I'm either faking

30:54.375 --> 30:56.167
or over-exaggerating my ra.

30:56.209 --> 30:57.876
- One hundred percent.
- Okay.

30:57.918 --> 30:59.709
Yeah, for someone

30:59.751 --> 31:02.876
to even mildly insinuate

31:02.918 --> 31:04.876
that I'm making it up

31:04.876 --> 31:06.042
or I'm exaggerating

31:06.042 --> 31:07.667
or I'm doing anything,

31:07.709 --> 31:09.334
it really hurts

31:09.375 --> 31:11.042
and then for that one person

31:11.042 --> 31:12.375
to be my friend,

31:12.375 --> 31:14.709
that's saying to me,

31:14.709 --> 31:15.959
"open up to me,"

31:16.000 --> 31:17.334
tell me what's going on.

31:17.375 --> 31:18.584
"Talk about it with me,"

31:18.626 --> 31:19.834
and I do.

31:19.876 --> 31:21.709
For the first time in five years

31:21.751 --> 31:23.000
that I've had this disease,

31:23.000 --> 31:24.250
I do.

31:24.250 --> 31:26.417
My ra's getting a lot worse,

31:26.417 --> 31:27.584
it's attacked

31:27.584 --> 31:28.751
my whole body right now.

31:28.751 --> 31:30.417
My doctors have said

31:30.417 --> 31:32.042
I have to do chemo.

31:33.918 --> 31:35.083
And I get this

31:35.083 --> 31:36.918
as a f... ing response,

31:36.959 --> 31:38.751
it's so f... ed up, Reza.

31:38.792 --> 31:40.042
When I heard this,

31:40.042 --> 31:41.250
I was like, are you... ugh.

31:41.250 --> 31:42.250
Like, I was just,

31:42.292 --> 31:43.751
my teeth were gonna break out

31:43.751 --> 31:45.417
I was cringing so hard.

31:45.417 --> 31:46.417
And that's why I was like,

31:46.459 --> 31:48.250
- "I can't get on.
- This f... ing flight."

31:48.292 --> 31:49.375
I need a moment.

31:49.417 --> 31:50.501
- I need to get.
- My thoughts together.

31:50.542 --> 31:52.834
Because golnesa, who she is,

31:52.876 --> 31:54.250
is she pops off

31:54.250 --> 31:55.417
and I'm not trying

31:55.417 --> 31:56.542
to be that person anymore.

31:56.584 --> 31:58.250
- I've had my fair share.
- Of being questioned.

31:58.292 --> 32:00.000
And doubted by this group.

32:00.042 --> 32:01.083
I mean, for god's sakes,

32:01.083 --> 32:02.584
I took a polygraph test

32:02.584 --> 32:04.501
two times to prove myself

32:04.542 --> 32:06.125
to this group last year

32:06.125 --> 32:08.250
- and they saw.
- That I was telling the truth.

32:08.292 --> 32:10.209
- Do I need.
- To get another polygraph test.

32:10.250 --> 32:12.209
To prove that I have a disease?

32:12.250 --> 32:13.417
In the last year,

32:13.459 --> 32:14.959
- that's why I've been.
- So mentally f... ed up,

32:15.000 --> 32:16.209
It's because for the first time,

32:16.250 --> 32:18.125
- it's hit me.
- That I have this disease.

32:18.167 --> 32:19.459
And it's for the rest of my life

32:19.459 --> 32:21.042
- and that I could pass.
- This on to my kids.

32:21.083 --> 32:23.375
This is real sh... for me.

32:23.417 --> 32:25.042
- I'm glad we're having.
- This conversation.

32:25.083 --> 32:26.751
My problem came

32:26.792 --> 32:28.042
when my mom hit me up

32:28.042 --> 32:29.292
in tears...

32:29.334 --> 32:30.751
You told me that.

32:30.792 --> 32:32.459
- And she thought.
- You had cancer.

32:32.501 --> 32:34.459
And then, I've had conversations

32:34.501 --> 32:36.542
with your homie, sherv,

32:36.584 --> 32:38.542
- and I've had conversations.
- With mj.

32:38.584 --> 32:39.584
Okay.

32:39.584 --> 32:40.584
I'm talking to people

32:40.626 --> 32:41.792
and everyone is saying

32:41.792 --> 32:43.959
things are not adding up,

32:43.959 --> 32:45.667
and I'm wondering

32:45.667 --> 32:47.334
why is my friend

32:47.375 --> 32:48.792
telling me stories

32:48.792 --> 32:50.167
that aren't adding up?

32:50.167 --> 32:51.250
I hate that.

32:51.292 --> 32:52.959
You can't blame a person

32:53.000 --> 32:54.250
for speculating

32:54.250 --> 32:55.501
and then when I'm hearing

32:55.501 --> 32:57.250
- you're going.
- To the doctor with mj.

32:57.292 --> 32:59.334
And she kept asking the doctor,

32:59.334 --> 33:00.584
he never uttered

33:00.584 --> 33:01.834
the word "chemotherapy,"

33:01.834 --> 33:03.334
- you were the one.
- That kept bringing it up.

33:03.375 --> 33:04.667
Okay,

33:04.667 --> 33:06.834
my results are in

33:06.834 --> 33:09.501
and I do have to start

33:09.542 --> 33:10.792
- this chemo. So...
- Okay,

33:10.834 --> 33:12.167
Has something gone

33:12.167 --> 33:13.459
to your heart?

33:15.042 --> 33:16.792
My fear was that it did.

33:16.834 --> 33:18.667
It could be a million things.

33:18.667 --> 33:20.125
It's a very,

33:20.125 --> 33:21.584
very invisible disease.

33:21.626 --> 33:23.250
- What I'm gonna say right now.
- To you is...

33:23.292 --> 33:25.125
- Yes?
- I have to start this chemo.

33:25.167 --> 33:26.667
I would really like it

33:26.667 --> 33:28.876
if you can be there.

33:28.876 --> 33:30.876
I would love to come.

33:30.876 --> 33:32.542
Do I believe gg now?

33:32.542 --> 33:34.042
I mean,

33:34.083 --> 33:36.876
it's been five years.

33:36.876 --> 33:37.876
Like family

33:37.918 --> 33:39.542
I've embraced this girl.

33:39.542 --> 33:42.292
Five years of suspicion,

33:42.334 --> 33:44.876
innuendo and lies.

33:44.876 --> 33:46.167
Part of me believes her

33:46.209 --> 33:47.459
but another part of me

33:47.459 --> 33:48.709
thinks she's exaggerating.

33:48.709 --> 33:50.042
I feel like the nearest

33:50.042 --> 33:51.375
and dearest person to me

33:51.417 --> 33:53.501
that has a doubt is you,

33:53.542 --> 33:55.334
so I wanna start with you.

33:55.375 --> 33:57.167
Absolutely.

33:58.417 --> 33:59.876
- Coming up...
- Hey, you're like,

33:59.876 --> 34:01.209
- "I apologize."
- How come you're always there.

34:01.209 --> 34:02.501
- In the middle of something...
- Shut the f... up.

34:02.542 --> 34:03.876
- With sh... popping?
- I said I never apologize.

34:03.876 --> 34:05.167
- You shut the f... up and watch.
- Out when you f... ing [Inaudible]

34:05.209 --> 34:06.667
- No, shut the f... up.
- I said I never apologize.

34:06.709 --> 34:08.042
- Listen,
- I'm a motherf... ing man,

34:08.083 --> 34:10.417
- Nobody talks to me like that.
- No, you wanna f... ing...

34:19.876 --> 34:21.000
- She has nothing else.
- Going on in her life.

34:21.042 --> 34:22.918
- She has no job.
- No boyfriend.

34:22.918 --> 34:24.584
- She wakes up at 1:30
- in the afternoon.

34:24.584 --> 34:26.751
- Strategizes until 5 pm.
- About how to start some drama.

34:26.792 --> 34:28.751
- Goes out and gets drunk.
- Until the next day.

34:28.751 --> 34:29.918
Yeah.

34:29.959 --> 34:31.709
So if you really care...

34:31.751 --> 34:32.918
Sometimes you gotta

34:32.918 --> 34:34.083
punch somebody...

34:34.125 --> 34:36.042
To help them.

34:36.083 --> 34:37.250
I'm definitely starting to see

34:37.250 --> 34:38.334
what the rest of the group

34:38.334 --> 34:39.417
is saying about golnesa.

34:39.417 --> 34:40.834
She's not easy to deal with.

34:40.876 --> 34:42.918
- I think golnesa exaggerates.
- Everything in life.

34:50.125 --> 34:51.709
- What's up,
- you've reached Tommy.

34:51.751 --> 34:53.459
- I'll get back to you.
- As soon as I can.

34:53.459 --> 34:55.918
Hey babe, it's me.

34:55.959 --> 34:57.125
I was looking for you

34:57.167 --> 34:58.959
and I don't know where you are,

34:58.959 --> 35:00.292
because I keep calling you

35:00.292 --> 35:01.626
whenever I have service,

35:01.667 --> 35:02.792
which is not that often

35:02.834 --> 35:04.667
because it's a patchy

35:04.667 --> 35:06.459
agricultural island.

35:06.459 --> 35:08.584
And I just want you to know

35:08.626 --> 35:09.626
I'm thinking of you.

35:09.626 --> 35:10.792
- And maybe I'll just call you.
- Back.

35:10.792 --> 35:11.876
In like, five minutes

35:11.876 --> 35:12.959
after I poop.

35:12.959 --> 35:13.959
Okay, bye.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.709
This just isn't a good sign.

35:15.751 --> 35:17.459
- I'm just getting sent.
- To voice-mail.

35:17.459 --> 35:18.542
Over and over again.

35:18.584 --> 35:19.584
Maybe I need to read

35:19.584 --> 35:20.584
between the lines.

35:20.626 --> 35:22.792
Maybe I'm supposed to live alone

35:22.792 --> 35:24.584
forever,

35:24.626 --> 35:25.709
like vida.

35:27.792 --> 35:29.250
You guys.

35:29.292 --> 35:30.334
Let's go.

35:31.626 --> 35:34.083
F..., I miss my wife, dude.

35:34.125 --> 35:36.292
So badly, I swear to god.

35:36.334 --> 35:37.918
- I thought.
- She'd be here by now.

35:37.959 --> 35:39.292
F... man, me too.

35:39.334 --> 35:41.000
- She's not even answering.
- My texts.

35:44.959 --> 35:48.167
This is stunning.

35:48.209 --> 35:49.334
- Wow.
- See, this is how it looked.

35:49.334 --> 35:50.834
At the table at my house.

35:50.834 --> 35:52.125
Is there food here?

35:52.167 --> 35:53.751
- [Inaudible]
- My back's to the thing.

35:53.792 --> 35:55.250
- No, you're fine.
- Everyone's coming,

35:55.292 --> 35:56.584
It's gonna be beautiful.

35:56.626 --> 35:57.626
Right here, boo boo,

35:57.667 --> 35:59.501
[speaking farsi]

35:59.542 --> 36:01.125
Appetizer.

36:01.167 --> 36:02.334
Babe,

36:02.334 --> 36:03.501
I've been eating all day.

36:03.501 --> 36:04.834
I have not been eating.

36:04.834 --> 36:05.918
Babe.

36:05.918 --> 36:06.959
You guys,

36:07.000 --> 36:09.167
can we do, like,

36:09.167 --> 36:11.626
let's do around the table

36:11.667 --> 36:13.209
and like,

36:13.209 --> 36:14.751
come clean with something.

36:14.792 --> 36:16.209
- What are we saying. - Around the table?
- You start.

36:16.250 --> 36:17.792
We all like,

36:17.792 --> 36:19.292
take something from in here

36:21.042 --> 36:22.209
and then confess it

36:22.250 --> 36:25.042
and burn it and take it.

36:25.083 --> 36:26.626
Come clean about something.

36:26.667 --> 36:27.876
How often do you masturbate?

36:27.876 --> 36:29.209
How often do you masturbate?

36:29.209 --> 36:30.709
I try to do it

36:30.751 --> 36:32.709
at least once a day.

36:32.709 --> 36:33.709
Me too.

36:33.751 --> 36:34.834
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

36:34.876 --> 36:36.334
- Me too.
- Oh god, man.

36:36.375 --> 36:38.375
- I'm nowhere near that.
- I try, I don't always get it.

36:38.375 --> 36:39.709
- Nima?
- I have to masturbate.

36:39.709 --> 36:41.000
At least once a day too.

36:41.042 --> 36:42.167
My confession

36:42.167 --> 36:43.292
is that I feel like

36:43.334 --> 36:46.042
I've been enabling golnesa.

36:46.042 --> 36:47.167
That's a beautiful thing.

36:47.209 --> 36:48.626
And I know

36:48.626 --> 36:50.042

38:19.751 --> 38:20.834
No, you don't.

38:20.834 --> 38:22.125

38:22.125 --> 38:23.417

38:23.459 --> 38:24.834
- You were there.

That he was saying,

38:26.125 --> 38:27.417

And then you...

38:35.876 --> 38:37.626
And then it came up.

38:37.667 --> 38:38.792
I didn't bring it up.

38:38.834 --> 38:39.918
- So what?
- So why am I being antagonized.

38:39.959 --> 38:41.000

38:47.292 --> 38:49.167
- I still wanna finish.
- My thought, I'm sorry,

38:49.167 --> 38:50.250
- I have to say it.
- Finish your thought.

38:50.292 --> 38:51.751
So what I was gonna say was,

38:51.792 --> 38:53.167
- I know you're going through.
- A lot of stuff.

38:53.167 --> 38:54.417

38:54.417 --> 38:55.626

39:05.334 --> 39:06.542

- I've been like...

39:08.584 --> 39:10.542

39:20.876 --> 39:22.000

- At Asa's runway show.

39:23.751 --> 39:25.626
- For no reason.
- That's bullsh...

39:25.667 --> 39:26.959

39:26.959 --> 39:28.292
