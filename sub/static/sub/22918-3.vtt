WEBVTT

00:11.320 --> 00:12.800
[Elizabeth] Now, Anne, what's this?

00:12.880 --> 00:14.760
-[Anne] A penguin.
-[Elizabeth] Very good.

00:14.840 --> 00:18.000
And, Charles, who do you suppose
is surrounded by penguins at the moment?

00:18.080 --> 00:20.000
-[Charles] Daddy.
-[Elizabeth] Yes, that's right.

00:20.080 --> 00:22.920
That's because he's in the Antarctic,
and from there,

00:23.000 --> 00:26.800
he goes to the South Shetland Islands,
then he goes on to the Falkland Islands.

00:26.880 --> 00:30.320
And then he goes all the way up here,
to Ascension Island.

00:31.040 --> 00:32.840
All these are
British Overseas Territories,

00:32.920 --> 00:34.920
and they have to be visited
every once in a while,

00:35.000 --> 00:37.080
so they don't feel neglected or forgotten,

00:37.160 --> 00:39.280
and don't get any silly ideas
like becoming independent.

00:39.360 --> 00:41.160
-Right, brushed your teeth?
-[Charles] Yes.

00:41.240 --> 00:42.960
-Good. Have you said your prayers?
-Yes.

00:43.040 --> 00:45.760
-Jolly good. Right. Night-night.
-[Anne] Night-night, Mommy.

00:46.320 --> 00:47.480
[Nanny] Come along, children.

00:47.560 --> 00:49.720
[Elizabeth] Oh, we might put a picture
of the Duke of Edinburgh

00:49.800 --> 00:52.600
by the children's bed,
so they recognize him when he gets back.

00:53.280 --> 00:55.080
Five months is a long time at that age.

00:55.160 --> 00:57.440
-[Nanny] Yes, ma'am.
-[footsteps approaching]

01:00.600 --> 01:03.440
-[Elizabeth] Oh, what's that?
-From His Royal Highness, ma'am.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.640
Footage from the Royal Tour.

01:05.880 --> 01:06.720
How nice.

01:08.880 --> 01:11.160
We might watch that instead
of our next film.

01:16.200 --> 01:17.200
[door closes]

01:28.520 --> 01:30.880
[sighs]

01:39.040 --> 01:40.680
[cocks gun]

01:45.520 --> 01:48.920
[phone ringing]

01:50.560 --> 01:52.280
Kensington 3742.

01:53.440 --> 01:54.320
Tommy.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.360
[scissors snipping]

03:13.920 --> 03:16.480
[airplane engines whining]

03:16.560 --> 03:18.960
[indistinct chattering]

03:25.280 --> 03:27.840
The Prime Minister returns
after three weeks in Jamaica.

03:27.920 --> 03:29.280
And here he is now!

03:29.360 --> 03:31.440
[reporters clamoring]

03:32.360 --> 03:34.000
[camera shutters clicking]

03:35.040 --> 03:39.000
Thank you. Thank you.
It's wonderful to be back amongst you.

03:40.240 --> 03:45.280
As you know, I, uh... I went away
to concentrate on my health.

03:46.040 --> 03:49.880
I'm now fully fit to resume my duties.

03:50.640 --> 03:53.200
-Thank you.
-[reporters clamoring]

03:55.440 --> 03:57.280
Quiet, everyone. Sit down you two.

03:57.360 --> 03:59.520
-[Anne] It's starting.
-Charles, come on, darling.

03:59.600 --> 04:04.160
Now, he's sent some notes to accompany
the footage, so I'll read aloud.

04:06.040 --> 04:08.040
-[light clicks]
-[projector whirs]

04:09.000 --> 04:10.360
"Hello, all of you!"

04:10.440 --> 04:11.280
[all] Hello!

04:11.360 --> 04:13.600
-[Elizabeth laughs] "Hello, Daddy!"
-[Anne] Hello, Daddy!

04:13.680 --> 04:15.840
[Elizabeth]  "I can picture
you all perfectly,

04:15.920 --> 04:19.160
sitting there wishing it was
Creature from the Black Lagoon.

04:19.240 --> 04:20.560
[all laughing]

04:20.640 --> 04:25.680
But instead, this is just
boring old me arriving..."

04:25.760 --> 04:27.240
-[Anne] Penguins!
-That's not Daddy, is it?

04:27.320 --> 04:28.560
"...at King George Island..."

04:28.640 --> 04:30.240
Look! [laughs]

04:30.320 --> 04:32.960
"...a hundred miles
off the coast of Antarctica..."

04:33.040 --> 04:35.520
-[Margaret] There's your daddy.
-[Anne] Is that Daddy?

04:35.600 --> 04:39.480
"...and nestled between the white bones
of ancient whales.

04:39.560 --> 04:42.840
Here we've made some new friends,
and Mike was rather smitten."

04:42.920 --> 04:45.160
-Look how tame they are.
-[Margaret] He's got a beard!

04:45.240 --> 04:46.960
Yes, yes.
They're all growing beards.

04:47.040 --> 04:49.280
-It makes them look a bit shifty.
-[laughter]

04:49.360 --> 04:52.360
Oh, no, don't say that.
It makes him look like an explorer.

04:56.520 --> 04:58.760
-[Queen Mother] What's that?
-This is very funny, Mommy.

04:58.840 --> 05:03.720
Um, "We've even installed some signage
so we can find our way home."

05:03.800 --> 05:06.920
Oh, Buckingham Palace!
Oh, that's good. I like that.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.400
"It's a bit of a commute to the office,
though."

05:09.480 --> 05:11.000
[laughing]

05:13.720 --> 05:16.680
[inaudible dialogue]

05:21.400 --> 05:23.600
"Luckily, we found some friends
for company,

05:23.680 --> 05:27.560
the British Hunting Aerosurvey teams,
who make

05:27.640 --> 05:30.320
excellent tennis companions."
Oh, look. [laughs]

05:30.400 --> 05:32.680
They're all playing tennis.
Isn't that silly?

05:32.760 --> 05:33.960
[Queen Mother] Goodness me!

05:34.040 --> 05:37.000
[Elizabeth] "Now, some things
about huskies that you never knew.

05:37.080 --> 05:39.680
They have eyes of different colors."

05:39.760 --> 05:42.600
-Oh, like the Kaiser.
-[Elizabeth] Oh, Mommy. [laughs]

05:43.160 --> 05:46.960
"But most of all,
they really, really like tennis balls."

05:47.040 --> 05:48.120
Yes, we can see that.

05:48.360 --> 05:50.880
"And they have claws to ensure
they don't slip on the ice."

05:50.960 --> 05:53.000
Oh, look, now, Philip's on one.

06:00.240 --> 06:02.920
"Joining our family
of animals are the penguins...

06:03.960 --> 06:06.880
and seals, who send their love to you all.

06:06.960 --> 06:07.920
As do I.

06:10.520 --> 06:11.960
Your loving papa...

06:12.800 --> 06:13.640
and husband.

06:15.720 --> 06:16.720
Philip."

06:28.440 --> 06:30.120
[projector clicking]

06:36.600 --> 06:38.480
-[Elizabeth] Good morning.
-[car door opens]

06:40.080 --> 06:40.920
[car door closes]

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Tommy?

06:43.400 --> 06:44.600
Your Majesty.

06:44.680 --> 06:46.800
I thought you were supposed to be
in happy retirement.

06:46.880 --> 06:49.680
-I am, ma'am.
-Then what on earth are you doing here?

06:50.240 --> 06:52.960
Oh, dear. Either you missed the place
more than you could bear,

06:53.040 --> 06:53.880
which would be--

06:53.960 --> 06:55.160
-Tragic.
-Yes.

06:56.080 --> 06:58.480
Or there's a serious problem,
and you've been called in to help.

06:58.560 --> 07:01.640
Yep. Just a routine matter
with Colonel Adeane, ma'am.

07:01.720 --> 07:04.560
It's hardly routine if he sent
one of the royal cars.

07:05.240 --> 07:07.640
Well, in actual fact, that's my car.

07:07.720 --> 07:08.880
We gave you a car?

07:08.960 --> 07:11.880
You did, ma'am.
As part of the farewell package.

07:11.960 --> 07:13.200
Not the driver too, surely?

07:13.280 --> 07:14.240
The driver too.

07:15.960 --> 07:18.080
-Was that me?
-I believe so.

07:18.600 --> 07:21.960
Well, you've always held a very special
place in all of our hearts, Tommy.

07:22.640 --> 07:23.840
Anyway, I must go.

07:24.040 --> 07:24.920
Windsor, ma'am?

07:25.480 --> 07:26.520
No, Sandringham.

07:27.200 --> 07:29.680
Michael's re-arranged things
to give me a couple of days off.

07:29.760 --> 07:31.080
Quite right.

07:32.240 --> 07:33.080
[laughs]

07:33.160 --> 07:36.280
-[car starts]
-[door closes]

07:41.920 --> 07:44.520
[Lascelles]  You did well
to bring this to me, Michael.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.960
I've served three generations
of the royal family, four monarchs...

07:51.920 --> 07:56.680
and done a good many things
to protect them, mostly from themselves,

07:56.760 --> 08:00.120
but this is the first time
I shall endeavor

08:00.200 --> 08:04.080
to save someone else's marriage
in order to safeguard the Crown.

08:04.800 --> 08:08.640
Not that we give a fig about the Parkers
or their happiness, you understand.

08:09.120 --> 08:11.120
Not a fig, Tommy. [scoffs]

08:17.280 --> 08:19.920
[telegram machine buzzing]

08:24.240 --> 08:26.200
[Morse code beeping]

08:38.480 --> 08:39.800
[Elizabeth]  Dear Philip...

08:40.720 --> 08:44.280
I cannot tell you how much we enjoyed
watching the film you sent.

08:44.920 --> 08:47.000
It was lovely to set eyes on you again.

08:48.560 --> 08:52.200
And the children were very impressed
by the whales and penguins.

08:53.120 --> 08:55.360
You looked very handsome, I thought,

08:55.440 --> 08:56.960
in your whaling outfit,

08:57.520 --> 08:59.240
-and hirsute, too.
-[knocks on door]

08:59.320 --> 09:01.480
[men chattering]

09:01.560 --> 09:04.440
"...and I can never forget
what my grandmother said to me

09:04.520 --> 09:06.600
about being married to a man
with a beard."

09:06.680 --> 09:09.960
[men cheering and laughing]

09:10.040 --> 09:11.600
She goes on, but actually no,

09:11.680 --> 09:13.000
I'm not going to repeat that bit.

09:13.080 --> 09:15.200
[man] Oh, come on.
Don't be a spoilsport.

09:15.280 --> 09:17.160
-Come on!
-[Philip] Ah!

09:17.240 --> 09:18.480
[cheering]

09:19.120 --> 09:20.040
Bloody hell!

09:20.120 --> 09:22.960
I think we can safely say
a very, very warm welcome

09:23.040 --> 09:25.160
-awaits His Royal Highness's return.
-[men clapping]

09:25.240 --> 09:27.880

[muted chattering]

09:47.560 --> 09:49.840
[chattering]

09:51.600 --> 09:52.840
Good morning.

09:53.720 --> 09:55.160
[Cabinet members] Morning.

09:55.680 --> 09:57.960
First of all, I must thank you

09:58.040 --> 10:01.680
for the way in which you have
all carried on without me...

10:02.800 --> 10:07.080
and for the manner in which Rab
has very competently

10:07.160 --> 10:08.720
stood in for me in my absence.

10:08.800 --> 10:12.560
You've kept me informed of all the major
decisions that had to be taken.

10:13.320 --> 10:17.320
In all these months,
we have been a united government.

10:18.320 --> 10:21.960
And we shall remain a united government.

10:22.040 --> 10:24.040
[Macmillan] But we're not
a united government,

10:24.120 --> 10:25.360
are we, Anthony?

10:26.080 --> 10:30.200
The war you insisted on has left us
as divided as Caesar and Pompey

10:30.280 --> 10:31.840
and the country in chaos.

10:32.280 --> 10:35.800
There is no petrol in the pumps.
There are no tins on the shelves.

10:35.880 --> 10:38.040
Our allies are aligned against us.

10:38.120 --> 10:40.920
Our international reputation is
in tatters.

10:41.680 --> 10:44.880
How adroitly your weather vane spins,
Harold.

10:47.320 --> 10:51.280
You were for the war... as I remember.

10:51.360 --> 10:54.080
Only as long as it was legal.

10:56.120 --> 10:56.960
You...

10:58.360 --> 10:59.320
liar!

11:03.800 --> 11:04.760
Liar!

11:05.920 --> 11:09.000
You wanted it every bit as much as I did!

11:12.840 --> 11:14.720
You'd have torn off Nasser's scalp

11:14.800 --> 11:17.320
with your own fingernails
given the chance,

11:17.880 --> 11:21.160
taken the oil from that canal
and set the Middle East ablaze!

11:21.240 --> 11:24.000
You've lost the trust of the people
and of the party.

11:25.160 --> 11:26.160
It's the end of the road.

11:27.040 --> 11:31.280
A road which you willingly led me down!

11:36.520 --> 11:38.320
And would you abandon me?

11:39.960 --> 11:41.080
Here?

11:44.960 --> 11:45.800
Hmm?

11:47.080 --> 11:48.240
[Cabinet member clears throat]

11:55.720 --> 11:56.600
All of you.

12:00.800 --> 12:01.880
Come now, Anthony...

12:04.160 --> 12:05.360
you know as well as I...

12:08.680 --> 12:10.680
there is no justice in politics.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.400
[children shouting]

12:20.440 --> 12:21.320
[dog barking]

12:22.000 --> 12:23.680
[dog whimpering]

12:24.360 --> 12:26.360
[man shouting]

12:31.560 --> 12:32.720
Captain Lascelles?

12:34.440 --> 12:35.400
Mrs. Parker.

12:37.320 --> 12:39.000
-What brings you here?
-[Lascelles] Oh.

12:40.440 --> 12:42.320
A retired man must make friends

12:42.400 --> 12:44.880
with all the good reading spots
in London.

12:44.960 --> 12:46.480
What are you reading, may I ask?

12:46.560 --> 12:48.600
Tell me that it's romantic poetry.

12:48.960 --> 12:50.080
Military history.

12:50.640 --> 12:52.640
The campaigns of Napoleon.

12:54.560 --> 12:56.120
-Your son?
-[Eileen] Yes.

12:56.200 --> 12:58.240
[Lascelles] Lieutenant Commander Parker
must be very proud.

12:58.880 --> 13:01.920
He might be.
If he knew what the children looked like.

13:02.560 --> 13:04.080
He's away again. On tour.

13:04.160 --> 13:05.800
You have my sympathy.

13:06.360 --> 13:08.560
I know from my own wife
how difficult that can be.

13:08.640 --> 13:11.400
Being left alone with the children
for days,

13:11.480 --> 13:13.480
[chuckles] sometimes weeks on end.

13:14.040 --> 13:17.280
Well, I'm sure that strong marriages
find a way through it.

13:18.120 --> 13:19.560
I'm afraid it's broken ours.

13:20.760 --> 13:22.160
I am sad to hear that.

13:23.360 --> 13:25.360
Might I ask if you'll hold off on any

13:25.440 --> 13:29.000
instruction or public announcement
just a little while longer?

13:29.720 --> 13:31.800
As we both know, the Duke of Edinburgh

13:31.880 --> 13:34.600
is performing important royal duties
on this tour,

13:34.680 --> 13:37.720
and we wouldn't want any story
breaking in the newspapers

13:37.800 --> 13:39.600
that might undermine his efforts.

13:40.680 --> 13:44.640
Or impugn the royal marriage.

13:45.840 --> 13:51.280
That's what you came here for, isn't it?
This wasn't a coincidence at all.

13:51.360 --> 13:54.040
You came here
because you knew it's where I'd be,

13:54.320 --> 13:57.800
and you wanted to put in a word
on their behalf. It's pathetic.

13:59.120 --> 14:01.960
Still their round-the-clock lackey,
even in retirement.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.600
[train whistle blows]

14:21.400 --> 14:22.280
[corgis barking]

14:22.360 --> 14:26.280
[Adeane]  Sorry to disturb you, ma'am.
I've just had a call from Downing Street.

14:26.840 --> 14:30.840
The Prime Minister has requested
an audience, as a matter of urgency.

14:30.920 --> 14:34.080
He's on the train
and will be with us by three p.m.

14:47.120 --> 14:50.440
[announcer over PA]  Platform one,
London train.

14:50.800 --> 14:52.720
Please stand back from the edge.

15:03.240 --> 15:05.960
[mob] Eden! Eden!

15:06.040 --> 15:07.800
[mob booing]

15:07.880 --> 15:09.560
[mob shouting]

15:29.200 --> 15:30.040
Thank you.

15:43.640 --> 15:45.840
[clamoring]

15:52.040 --> 15:53.400
[shouting]

15:53.480 --> 15:55.760
[car horn honking]

16:07.480 --> 16:08.560
[women] Eden must go!

16:11.680 --> 16:13.880
[Eden] Of course,
I asked for second opinions.

16:13.960 --> 16:15.480
I asked for third opinions.

16:16.080 --> 16:18.640
I implored them to let me carry on.

16:18.720 --> 16:22.120
But I'm afraid the doctors were
of one voice, one mind.

16:23.880 --> 16:27.080
The time has come to put my health
above the country...

16:29.160 --> 16:30.040
and to...

16:32.320 --> 16:33.280
Uh...

16:35.480 --> 16:37.160
To offer you my resignation.

16:41.080 --> 16:43.720
I'm sorry if I, uh...

16:46.120 --> 16:47.600
disappointed you.

16:48.160 --> 16:49.560
Did I suggest that you had?

16:50.080 --> 16:52.360
No, but I...

16:55.640 --> 16:57.120
I think you thought it.

16:57.200 --> 16:58.120
[sighs]

17:00.000 --> 17:00.840
I...

17:04.840 --> 17:10.000
I did think that the decision
to go to war was rushed.

17:11.040 --> 17:14.520
And I was sorry to see you lie
to the House, when you told them

17:14.600 --> 17:17.040
that you had no prior knowledge
of the Israelis' intentions.

17:19.240 --> 17:20.960
We both know that to be untrue.

17:22.160 --> 17:24.160
But, wrong though it was...

17:24.720 --> 17:26.280
I did have sympathy for you.

17:29.720 --> 17:35.480
To have waited in the wings for so long
and to have supported a great man

17:35.560 --> 17:40.360
like Winston so patiently, so loyally.

17:41.480 --> 17:45.040
And then to finally have your opportunity
to measure yourself against him.

17:48.040 --> 17:49.360
To do nothing is

17:49.440 --> 17:51.680
often the best course of action...

17:54.040 --> 17:58.720
but I know from personal experience
how frustrating it can be.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.720
History was not made
by those who did nothing.

18:07.120 --> 18:12.200
So, I suppose it's only natural
that ambitious men, driven men...

18:13.880 --> 18:15.560
want to go down in history.

18:17.600 --> 18:20.840
Or make history by going down.

18:45.720 --> 18:47.400
[Lascelles on phone]
I do think the time has come

18:47.480 --> 18:49.800
where we have no option
but to tell Her Majesty

18:49.880 --> 18:51.440
about the Parker divorce,

18:51.520 --> 18:55.640
and to warn her that regardless of how
blameless the Duke of Edinburgh is

18:56.080 --> 18:58.000
or isn't in the matter,

18:58.080 --> 19:00.960
that newspapers will be newspapers,
and questions will now

19:01.200 --> 19:03.920
inevitably be asked about the state
of the royal marriage.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
[Adeane] Hmm.

19:07.600 --> 19:09.760
[Lascelles] I sense trepidation, Michael.

19:10.480 --> 19:13.040
If you'd rather,
I can always handle it myself.

19:13.120 --> 19:14.280
No, I'll take care of this...

19:15.480 --> 19:18.440
and try to find a moment on the train
to mention it to Her Majesty.

19:18.720 --> 19:19.760
Good luck, Michael.

19:27.560 --> 19:31.760
[Adeane]  Sorry to disturb you, ma'am.
A telegram arrived from Lord Salisbury,

19:31.840 --> 19:35.320
and the recommendation is
that Sir Anthony's successor

19:35.400 --> 19:36.920
should be Mr. Macmillan.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.520
Of course. Thank you.

19:44.800 --> 19:48.560
-Yes, what is it, Michael?
-Uh, it's just to say...

19:49.400 --> 19:51.840
and we could, of course,
discuss this on our return

19:51.920 --> 19:54.120
to the palace if Her Majesty prefers.

19:54.200 --> 19:55.960
No. Do sit down, Michael.

19:57.960 --> 19:58.840
Thank you, ma'am.

20:00.520 --> 20:03.000
Um, but it seems that...

20:04.120 --> 20:08.640
Mrs. Parker, uh, who is the wife
of Lieutenant Commander Parker...

20:08.720 --> 20:10.800
Yes, I know who Eileen is.

20:11.360 --> 20:12.240
[laughs nervously]

20:12.320 --> 20:18.440
Um, she has decided
to sue her husband for divorce.

20:19.760 --> 20:23.400
Goodness. Is that what you wanted
to talk to me about?

20:23.480 --> 20:25.240
Yes. Um...

20:26.600 --> 20:30.440
And that while, of course,
there is no suggestion whatsoever

20:30.520 --> 20:32.800
of any impropriety
on the part of His Royal Highness,

20:32.880 --> 20:35.800
the Duke of Edinburgh, we should perhaps
be bracing ourselves

20:35.880 --> 20:38.320
for one or two irritating headlines.

20:38.400 --> 20:41.280
-[laughs nervously]
-Why? Whatever for?

20:42.560 --> 20:44.160
What is it that she's alleging?

20:44.960 --> 20:47.760
Cruelty, unlawful desertion and, uh...

20:48.240 --> 20:49.800
[train whistle blows]

20:49.880 --> 20:51.240
Uh, adultery, ma'am.

20:53.120 --> 20:56.600
We're just aware of the fact that
Lieutenant Commander Parker

20:56.680 --> 21:00.680
is His Royal Highness's private secretary,
he's a close friend,

21:00.760 --> 21:03.560
and there is this letter, I believe.

21:04.320 --> 21:05.160
A letter?

21:06.280 --> 21:11.240
Written by Lieutenant Commander Parker
to his fellow members of the lunch club,

21:11.320 --> 21:16.360
bragging about exploits
on the royal tour.

21:16.440 --> 21:17.600
What sort of exploits?

21:22.880 --> 21:25.240
-Uh...
-No... [inhales]

21:25.320 --> 21:28.600
I don't need an answer to that question.
Thank you, Michael.

21:29.760 --> 21:30.680
Thank you, ma'am.

21:37.600 --> 21:38.440
[door closes]

21:46.520 --> 21:47.640
[urinating]

21:47.720 --> 21:48.560
[zips pants]

21:49.440 --> 21:52.640
[toilet flushing]

21:52.720 --> 21:55.640
[water running]

21:58.720 --> 22:00.160
[sighs]

22:04.440 --> 22:05.280
[knock on door]

22:05.560 --> 22:06.520
[door opens]

22:07.800 --> 22:09.280
Mr. Macmillan, Your Majesty.

22:16.200 --> 22:17.160
[door closes]

22:18.000 --> 22:18.840
Your Majesty.

22:21.080 --> 22:23.120
I gather soundings have been taken,

22:23.800 --> 22:25.840
and that you have been chosen
by your colleagues

22:25.920 --> 22:29.400
as the man most able to unite
the government and lead this country

22:29.480 --> 22:31.280
following Sir Anthony's resignation.

22:31.400 --> 22:32.280
Yes, ma'am.

22:33.880 --> 22:34.720
Congratulations.

22:37.800 --> 22:41.120
Although I fear you've inherited
something of a poisoned chalice.

22:41.200 --> 22:46.280
[laughs] It's true.
The storm is now raging against us.

22:47.040 --> 22:50.720
With Eden's war,
we've discarded the moral advantage

22:50.800 --> 22:53.880
or any goodwill we once held.

22:53.960 --> 22:57.320
Not to mention
the dire economic situation.

22:58.480 --> 23:00.120
It's really been quite ruinous.

23:00.200 --> 23:04.240
But it wasn't just Eden's war, was it?

23:05.040 --> 23:07.800
It was a war prosecuted by a government

23:08.120 --> 23:12.720
of which you, as chancellor,
were a major constituent part.

23:13.280 --> 23:17.080
I also seem to remember
that you were one of the loudest voices

23:17.160 --> 23:19.400
in support of the war in the beginning.

23:21.920 --> 23:26.960
One always has to accept one's own part,
I believe...

23:28.680 --> 23:29.640
in any mess.

23:36.240 --> 23:37.080
Prime Minister.

23:38.480 --> 23:39.360
Your Majesty.

23:41.440 --> 23:43.120
[rings bell]

23:43.200 --> 23:44.360
[door opens]

23:56.200 --> 24:00.000
Michael, could you ask them
to send 'round one of the cars?

24:02.640 --> 24:04.000
[officer 1 over radio]  Bridge receiving.
Go ahead.

24:04.080 --> 24:06.080
[officer 2 over radio]  D-Watch
requests permission to leave.

24:06.160 --> 24:07.840
[officer 1 over radio]  Granted.
Affirmative.

24:26.600 --> 24:28.280
[officer 2 over radio]  Ship's communication
to bridge.

24:28.360 --> 24:29.760
[officer 1 over radio]  Bridge receiving.
Go ahead.

24:29.840 --> 24:31.360
[indistinct radio chatter]

24:47.440 --> 24:48.280
[knock on door]

24:51.440 --> 24:52.280
[sighs]

24:53.920 --> 24:54.880
Do you have a moment?

25:03.400 --> 25:04.640
What were you thinking?

25:06.280 --> 25:10.320
You know the rules. No letters to anyone.

25:12.200 --> 25:14.120
I told Baron to be discreet.

25:16.680 --> 25:19.840
But somehow the letter got back to Eileen.

25:19.920 --> 25:21.920
And now she has written to the palace...

25:24.880 --> 25:27.840
to give notice of her intention
to sue me for divorce.

25:32.440 --> 25:34.640
Which means it's got back
to you-know-who.

25:36.440 --> 25:37.520
Yes.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.600
I think we have to assume so.

25:51.400 --> 25:53.520
[woman laughing]
Don't tease me like that.

26:01.600 --> 26:03.000
-[man] Good morning.
-[woman] Good morning.

26:29.240 --> 26:31.440
[Elizabeth] I remember how
we used to do this in Malta.

26:32.160 --> 26:33.840
Go grocery shopping together.

26:34.640 --> 26:36.000
Feels like a long time ago.

26:36.920 --> 26:37.840
Yes.

26:44.960 --> 26:47.480
The reason I came here today is, uh...

26:50.280 --> 26:52.440
because I heard, with great sadness,

26:53.160 --> 26:55.120
that there are difficulties
in your marriage.

26:57.720 --> 26:59.840
And I would like to know
if there's anything that I or...

27:00.440 --> 27:01.840
anyone else can do to help.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.240
My marriage to Mike is beyond help.

27:06.080 --> 27:06.920
I see.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.240
Our separation has been inevitable
for some time.

27:10.760 --> 27:13.640
I had intended to divorce Mike years ago,
but because of the attention

27:13.720 --> 27:17.040
surrounding Group Captain Townsend
and Princess Margaret...

27:18.000 --> 27:19.400
I decided to hold back.

27:19.480 --> 27:20.440
Thank you.

27:21.720 --> 27:24.040
But that was then. This is now.

27:26.640 --> 27:27.720
What's changed?

27:29.000 --> 27:32.240
Nothing has changed. That's the problem.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
It just got worse.

27:34.080 --> 27:38.480
And while some women may elect
to put up with this sort of humiliation,

27:38.560 --> 27:42.960
I simply have too much respect for myself
and my children to bear it.

27:45.280 --> 27:47.440
I'm afraid I don't know
what you're talking about.

28:01.960 --> 28:03.160
[Eileen] Then read this.

28:11.240 --> 28:12.080
[Elizabeth] Hmm.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.400
Don't bury it, ma'am...

28:31.320 --> 28:32.360
or sweep it away.

28:33.640 --> 28:35.640
It's there, in black and white.

28:44.800 --> 28:46.760
Might I ask you a favor?

28:48.640 --> 28:51.920
That you hold off your announcement,
just while we work out what to do,

28:52.000 --> 28:52.880
in light of this?

28:53.240 --> 28:56.640
I've had enough of favors to you people.

28:57.760 --> 29:00.880
My entire adult life
has been favors to you.

29:01.320 --> 29:05.720
You people aren't even remotely aware
of the cost of the damage to families

29:05.800 --> 29:07.320
and marriages in your service.

29:07.800 --> 29:10.720
I've instructed a solicitor.
That's my decision.

29:14.280 --> 29:17.840
[camera shutters clicking]

29:17.920 --> 29:23.240
Gentlemen, I would like to make
a brief statement on behalf of my client,

29:23.320 --> 29:24.920
Mrs. Eileen Parker.

29:28.440 --> 29:32.200
"Having endured an unhappy marriage
for some years now,

29:32.520 --> 29:34.120
I have come to the sad conclusion

29:34.200 --> 29:37.400
that a formal separation
is the best option for us both.

29:38.640 --> 29:41.920
My husband has shown
no inclination or enthusiasm

29:42.000 --> 29:45.160
for the responsibilities of parenthood
or marriage...

29:46.480 --> 29:49.440
and divorce remains the only solution."

29:50.000 --> 29:52.240
-Thank you.
-[all speaking indistinctly]

29:53.360 --> 29:54.640
Mr. Lewis!

29:55.800 --> 29:59.720
Duke's best friend and wife separate,
read all about it!

29:59.800 --> 30:01.320
Read all about it!

30:09.280 --> 30:11.960
[typewriter clicking]

30:37.640 --> 30:38.480
No.

30:54.280 --> 30:57.360
[seagulls squawking]

30:59.560 --> 31:00.560
[knock on door]

31:03.400 --> 31:04.960
[door opens]

31:05.600 --> 31:06.440
[Mike] Sir.

31:08.000 --> 31:08.840
Uh...

31:09.640 --> 31:11.680
Telegram from my lawyer in London.

31:11.760 --> 31:16.080
His view is that, yes, the newspaper
coverage is bad, but it's not disastrous,

31:16.160 --> 31:19.520
and he feels confident it'll all die down
in 48 hours.

31:20.240 --> 31:21.840
He thinks we can ride it out.

31:22.920 --> 31:25.000
You and I both know
that's wishful thinking.

31:26.760 --> 31:28.640
I've had my own telegram from London.

31:35.200 --> 31:36.440
I-- [clears throat]

31:37.360 --> 31:40.080
I hope you're not going to make
this next step difficult for me.

31:48.120 --> 31:48.960
No.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.680
You'll have my resignation first thing.

31:52.760 --> 31:53.760
I'll need it now.

32:11.040 --> 32:12.680
I hereby offer my resignation...

32:16.680 --> 32:18.800
as Principal Private Secretary
to the Duke of Edinburgh.

32:18.880 --> 32:20.000
Effective immediately.

32:21.200 --> 32:22.040
Accepted.

32:26.320 --> 32:28.880
You've worked for me for long enough.
You know the rules.

32:29.920 --> 32:31.320
Who we are. How it works.

32:32.880 --> 32:37.240
There is no room for mistakes.
There is no room for scandal.

32:37.800 --> 32:39.360
There is no room for humanity.

32:42.520 --> 32:44.840
I think you should probably leave us
in Gibraltar.

32:46.200 --> 32:49.120
Might I suggest a policy
of "no comment" on all counts,

32:49.200 --> 32:50.520
and especially no letters?

32:53.280 --> 32:54.160
Yes, of course.

33:00.920 --> 33:01.960
[door opens]

33:04.520 --> 33:05.520
[exhales deeply]

33:13.440 --> 33:15.880
[seagulls squawking]

33:18.240 --> 33:20.640
[chattering]

33:20.720 --> 33:22.240
[reporter 1] Commander Parker!

33:22.320 --> 33:24.040
[reporter 2] Did the Duke fire you, sir?

33:30.040 --> 33:32.240
[clamoring]

33:36.080 --> 33:38.760
[reporter 3] Just a few words?
Just a few words, sir?

33:38.840 --> 33:39.680
Piss off.

33:40.440 --> 33:41.440
Go on, piss off.

33:41.960 --> 33:45.880
Go on now. Go on!
Go on, I've got nothing to say. Piss off!

33:47.440 --> 33:50.840
[Lascelles]  Following the resignation
of Lieutenant Commander Parker,

33:50.920 --> 33:54.840
the British press have fallen into line
and been overwhelmingly supportive.

33:55.160 --> 33:56.240
[Queen Mother]  But?

33:56.320 --> 34:00.520
[Lascelles]  I'm afraid the foreign
newspapers have not been so kind.

34:01.120 --> 34:04.160
Yesterday, a story broke
in the  Baltimore Sun...

34:04.240 --> 34:06.440
-[laughs] Where?
-Baltimore, Mommy.

34:07.280 --> 34:09.679
...claiming that the capital was awash
with rumor

34:09.760 --> 34:12.159
that the Duke of Edinburgh
was romantically involved

34:12.239 --> 34:15.639
with an unnamed woman
whom he met on a regular basis

34:15.720 --> 34:19.360
in the West End apartment
of a society photographer, Baron Nahum.

34:19.960 --> 34:24.120
Nahum is also president
of the Thursday Club in Soho,

34:24.199 --> 34:26.600
of which the Duke of Edinburgh
is a founder member.

34:26.679 --> 34:30.560
Anyway, that story has rather
lit the touch paper.

34:30.840 --> 34:35.120
The British press has caught on,
with  The Manchester Guardian  reporting,

34:35.199 --> 34:37.239
"Not since the first rumors of a romance

34:37.320 --> 34:41.600
between the former King Edward VIII
and Mrs. Ernest Simpson

34:42.080 --> 34:46.000
have Americans gobbled up
the London dispatches so avidly."

34:47.480 --> 34:48.320
Go on.

34:48.920 --> 34:53.679
The  Sunday Pictorial,  on its front page,
reminds its readers that the royal family

34:53.760 --> 34:58.320
"is loved and envied throughout the world
because it is a family."

34:58.560 --> 35:02.320
Time  magazine has a headline:
"Too Much Thursdaying."

35:02.400 --> 35:05.520
It goes on to say,
"Not since Wallis Simpson

35:05.600 --> 35:08.680
stalked the corridors of Buckingham Palace
have the eyes of the world

35:08.760 --> 35:13.920
been turned so beadily
towards those chintz drapes."

35:27.080 --> 35:29.560
I say we fly the Duke of Edinburgh back
straight away.

35:30.760 --> 35:33.520
That's one thought, Your Majesty.
And it's a good one.

35:34.320 --> 35:36.160
The devil's advocate might argue,

35:36.240 --> 35:39.560
and I'd be interested to hear Michael's
thoughts on this,

35:39.640 --> 35:44.480
that the Duke's early return,
obviously stage-managed by the palace,

35:44.720 --> 35:47.720
might appear too much of a concession
to the newspapers

35:47.960 --> 35:51.520
and pour even more petrol on the flames.

35:52.880 --> 35:53.880
I would agree.

35:55.560 --> 35:57.080
[Lascelles] And we don't want that.

35:58.640 --> 35:59.640
[Queen Mother] No.

36:05.680 --> 36:06.640
So, what then?

36:15.360 --> 36:16.200
What?

36:19.360 --> 36:20.800
[knock on door]

36:20.880 --> 36:21.720
[Philip] Yes?

36:22.120 --> 36:22.960
[door opens]

36:23.480 --> 36:25.280
[valet] The Admiral
would like a word, sir.

36:26.120 --> 36:28.680
[Philip] That's fine.
Tell him he can come.

36:28.760 --> 36:31.560
[valet] As a matter of fact,
he suggested you go to see him, sir.

36:44.560 --> 36:47.000
[man speaking indistinctly over radio]

36:55.840 --> 36:57.360
-Thank you, sir.
-[crew member] Sir.

37:02.880 --> 37:05.840
[Smith] ...but if something has to
attack Chinese currents in a Flycatcher

37:05.920 --> 37:08.240
and then put down on the deck
of a Hermes...

37:08.320 --> 37:09.160
Admiral.

37:10.840 --> 37:12.520
Oh, do come in, commander.

37:13.320 --> 37:14.440
Thank you.

37:14.520 --> 37:15.840
[Smith] Buckingham Palace
has been in touch

37:15.920 --> 37:19.040
regarding your reunion photo-call
with Her Majesty the Queen.

37:19.120 --> 37:21.000
With you? Not me?

37:21.560 --> 37:23.160
I am in command of this ship.

37:24.480 --> 37:25.520
I am her husband.

37:27.040 --> 37:30.480
It's been agreed that Her Majesty will fly
out to Lisbon a day ahead of schedule.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.440
-As I see it, your instructions...
-Instructions?

37:33.920 --> 37:35.200
[Smith] ...are to meet her
at the airfield.

37:35.280 --> 37:38.280
They've been quite specific
for how the reunion is to be managed.

37:45.720 --> 37:46.640
Thank you.

38:27.160 --> 38:29.080
[seagulls squawking]

38:32.160 --> 38:33.000
Tie.

38:37.080 --> 38:39.200
Not that one.
One that's fit for an adult.

38:39.480 --> 38:40.640
Those were the instructions.

38:40.720 --> 38:42.880
For God's sake. It has hearts on it.

38:45.040 --> 38:46.200
And the hat, too?

38:46.280 --> 38:48.360
-Yes, sir.
-I hate hats.

38:48.440 --> 38:50.600
I believe its value on this occasion

38:50.680 --> 38:53.120
is not in its being worn,
but in its being removed.

38:53.200 --> 38:54.040
Ah.

38:54.800 --> 38:57.480
"In a gesture of chivalry and deference."

38:57.560 --> 38:59.120
Before I enter the aircraft.

38:59.600 --> 39:01.520
Before you reach the stairs
of the aircraft.

39:03.760 --> 39:04.640
[sighs]

39:06.040 --> 39:08.040
[clamoring]

39:23.200 --> 39:24.080
Michael.

39:24.160 --> 39:25.640
[Adeane] Your hat, sir.

39:38.120 --> 39:41.080
[man] Yes, perhaps it would be prudent
to postpone the civic lunches...

39:41.160 --> 39:42.000
[Philip coughs]

39:44.320 --> 39:45.200
Darling.

40:02.240 --> 40:03.120
We'll talk later.

40:06.320 --> 40:07.160
Shall we?

40:19.360 --> 40:20.560
[reporter 1] Your Majesty!

40:21.480 --> 40:25.240
And here they are.
Reunited at last, but for how long?

40:25.320 --> 40:26.480
[reporter 2] Your Royal Highness!

40:29.200 --> 40:30.560
[shouting]

40:33.240 --> 40:34.680
[reporter 3] Have you missed her?

40:37.800 --> 40:40.080
[reporter 4] ...and display
a united front to the world.

40:40.160 --> 40:42.880
This will do little to quell rumors
of a rift.

41:09.680 --> 41:11.520
[foghorn sounds]

41:11.600 --> 41:13.560
[reporter 1] Unprecedented scenes here

41:13.640 --> 41:15.560
as photographers
from all over the world...

41:15.640 --> 41:17.360
[reporter 2] The Queen
and the Duke of Edinburgh

41:17.440 --> 41:20.080
hide from the world's eyes
on board the Royal Yacht.

41:21.200 --> 41:23.800
[reporter 3] Now the eyes of the world
turn towards the Royal Yacht,

41:23.880 --> 41:25.680
on which they have sought shelter.

41:27.400 --> 41:28.960
[Elizabeth] No, no. No, I see.

41:29.880 --> 41:30.720
Thank you.

41:38.360 --> 41:40.360
That was the palace press secretary.

41:43.120 --> 41:46.080
-In his view, the steps we've taken--
-[Philip] The show we've put on.

41:48.800 --> 41:52.080
The steps that we've taken
haven't quite done the trick.

41:54.520 --> 41:56.720
The rumors still haven't gone away.

42:03.240 --> 42:05.560
[door creaks]

42:06.280 --> 42:08.680
I think we both agree
it can't go on like this.

42:14.840 --> 42:15.680
No.

42:30.520 --> 42:34.400
So I thought we might
take this opportunity...

42:35.720 --> 42:38.880
without the children,
without distraction...

42:40.360 --> 42:41.960
to lay our cards on the table...

42:44.520 --> 42:46.480
and talk frankly for once...

42:47.520 --> 42:51.360
about what needs to change
to make this marriage work.

42:51.960 --> 42:54.080
All right. Who goes first?

42:54.560 --> 42:58.120
Stupid question. If I've learned one thing
by now, it's that I go second.

42:59.840 --> 43:02.720
If I am to go first,
that's where I'd start.

43:05.760 --> 43:06.600
Your complaining.

43:07.280 --> 43:09.040
-My complaining?
-It's incessant.

43:09.120 --> 43:10.960
Whining and whingeing like a child.

43:11.040 --> 43:12.040
Are you surprised?

43:12.800 --> 43:15.360
The way those god-awful mustaches
that run the palace continue

43:15.440 --> 43:16.280
to infantilize me.

43:16.360 --> 43:19.160
-If you weren't behaving like an infant--
-Giving me lists, instructions.

43:19.240 --> 43:21.480
"Do this, don't do that,
wear this, don't wear that,

43:21.560 --> 43:24.120
say this, not that." Can you imagine
anything more humiliating?

43:24.200 --> 43:27.120
Yes. As a matter of fact, I can.

43:29.360 --> 43:31.920
I've learned more about humiliation
in the past few weeks

43:32.000 --> 43:33.800
than I hoped I would in a lifetime.

43:41.080 --> 43:43.840
I've never felt more alone
than I have in the past five months.

43:45.760 --> 43:46.840
And why do you think that was?

43:48.560 --> 43:51.520
-Because of your behavior.
-Because you sent me away.

43:51.600 --> 43:54.600
-Yes. And why do you think that was?
-I don't know. You tell me.

43:55.160 --> 43:56.880
Because you're lost.

43:56.960 --> 43:59.720
You're lost in your role,
and you're lost in yourself.

44:00.480 --> 44:01.360
Christ!

44:02.920 --> 44:04.320
-[Philip pours drink]
-Look...

44:06.120 --> 44:09.600
I realize this marriage has turned out
to be something quite different

44:09.680 --> 44:12.080
-to what we both imagined.
-Understatement.

44:12.160 --> 44:14.720
And that we both find ourselves in a...

44:15.960 --> 44:17.080
Prison?

44:20.680 --> 44:23.840
In a situation that is unique.

44:25.920 --> 44:28.200
Our marriage is different
to any other in the country because

44:28.760 --> 44:31.160
the exit route
which is open to everyone else...

44:31.240 --> 44:32.200
Divorce?

44:32.760 --> 44:34.600
Yes, divorce.

44:36.640 --> 44:38.080
It's not an option for us.

44:41.360 --> 44:42.200
Ever.

44:45.120 --> 44:46.120
[puts glass down]

44:51.960 --> 44:52.840
[exhales]

44:53.680 --> 44:54.520
No.

45:04.200 --> 45:08.240
This... This restlessness of yours,
it has to be a thing of the past.

45:11.520 --> 45:12.600
It's what I need.

45:13.920 --> 45:15.520
And it's what our family needs.

45:18.400 --> 45:19.480
The monarchy's too fragile.

45:19.560 --> 45:22.800
You keep telling me yourself,
one more scandal,

45:22.880 --> 45:25.960
one more national embarrassment
and it would all be over.

45:32.680 --> 45:34.640
So, what would make it easier on you?

45:36.360 --> 45:38.880
To be in, not out.

45:42.360 --> 45:43.520
What will it take?

45:47.360 --> 45:48.720
You're asking my price?

45:52.360 --> 45:56.040
I'm asking... what it will take.

46:08.400 --> 46:09.240
All right.

46:11.480 --> 46:16.160
To make it work... to make it bearable...

46:17.160 --> 46:20.520
I'll need the respect and acknowledgment
of the dreaded mustaches.

46:21.240 --> 46:22.480
Please stop calling them that.

46:22.560 --> 46:25.280
[Philip] I'll stop calling them that
when they don't all have one.

46:25.360 --> 46:28.240
An end to their snobbery and prejudice,
no more being sniffed at

46:28.320 --> 46:30.880
for being a foreigner with a background
nobody understands.

46:30.960 --> 46:33.000
You will earn their respect
with your behavior.

46:33.080 --> 46:34.960
No. No. No.

46:35.040 --> 46:39.200
I will earn their respect with the only
thing those creatures understand:

46:39.280 --> 46:40.280
a gesture, a statement.

46:40.360 --> 46:43.240
Something irrefutable that shuts them up
and commands their respect.

46:43.320 --> 46:46.680
Right now, I am currently outranked
by my eight-year-old son!

46:46.760 --> 46:48.960
Well, yes, of course.
He's the heir to the throne.

46:58.280 --> 47:00.200
I am his father, Elizabeth.

47:02.880 --> 47:05.640
[thunder rumbling]

47:08.800 --> 47:10.320
[Duke of Norfolk]  Her Majesty the Queen

47:10.400 --> 47:15.800
has been pleased by Letters Patent
under the Great Seal of the Realm

47:16.120 --> 47:20.520
bearing the date
the 22nd of February, 1957,

47:20.600 --> 47:22.440
to give and to grant

47:23.280 --> 47:26.840
unto his Royal Highness,
the Duke of Edinburgh,

47:27.400 --> 47:30.200
the style and titular dignity

47:30.480 --> 47:36.440
of a prince of the United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

47:39.080 --> 47:43.200
The Duke of Edinburgh
shall henceforth be known

47:43.280 --> 47:48.320
as His Royal Highness,
the Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.

49:54.200 --> 49:56.920
"O, famous son of England, this is he.

49:57.640 --> 50:00.000
Great by land and great by sea.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.200
Thine island loves thee well,

50:03.280 --> 50:06.080
thou greatest sailor
since our world began."

50:06.160 --> 50:07.160
[camera shutter clicks]

50:07.240 --> 50:08.840
Quite marvelous, sir. Thank you.

50:10.080 --> 50:12.440
"Now to the roll of muffled drums,

50:12.520 --> 50:15.200
to thee the greatest soldier comes.

50:15.280 --> 50:17.840
For this is he,
O give him welcome.

50:17.920 --> 50:21.560
This is he, England's greatest son.

50:21.880 --> 50:24.120
He that gained a hundred fights,

50:24.640 --> 50:27.000
nor ever lost an English gun."

50:28.560 --> 50:29.400
[camera shutter clicks]

50:29.480 --> 50:31.480
Quite magnificent, sir.

50:32.600 --> 50:33.520
Quite marvelous.

50:33.600 --> 50:36.560
Michael? Do you have a moment?

50:36.640 --> 50:37.560
Of course, ma'am.

50:43.680 --> 50:46.800
[scissors snipping]

50:48.440 --> 50:50.400
[water splashes]

51:20.400 --> 51:21.680
Sorry it's a bit gloomy.

51:22.560 --> 51:23.400
[Philip] A bit?

51:24.360 --> 51:26.840
[Mike] I was never much good
around the house without Eileen.

51:26.920 --> 51:28.600
[Philip] You could have at least
put the fire on.

51:29.080 --> 51:31.920
Hey. I've provided whiskey, all right?

51:32.000 --> 51:34.840
I've burnt some sausages.
Who do you think you are, royalty?

51:34.920 --> 51:35.960
[Philip laughs]

51:38.800 --> 51:41.040
[Mike] Here you are. [sighs]

51:50.280 --> 51:53.160
-To our wives and sweethearts.
-May they never meet.

51:53.240 --> 51:54.760
[both chuckle]

51:55.760 --> 51:58.400
What will you do now?
Go back to the Navy?

51:58.480 --> 52:01.280
No. I'm going back home.

52:01.920 --> 52:03.080
The Navy is home.

52:03.920 --> 52:04.880
My other home.

52:05.400 --> 52:06.640
Australia.

52:06.720 --> 52:07.560
Oh.

52:09.120 --> 52:10.160
Can I come?

52:12.240 --> 52:14.200
And I thought everything
was all sorted in your world.

52:14.280 --> 52:17.200
Well, as sorted as it can be.
When you sell yourself.

52:27.800 --> 52:30.440
-She wants more children.
-[inhales] Ouch!

52:30.520 --> 52:33.640
I told her the last thing the world needs
is more royal mouths to feed.

52:33.720 --> 52:37.840
She said, "You should think of it
as a second act."

52:37.920 --> 52:39.320
Of what? A Greek tragedy?

52:39.400 --> 52:40.960
Of her life as a mother.

52:41.720 --> 52:42.760
[Philip laughs]

52:43.880 --> 52:46.480
-That makes sense, from her perspective.
-Hmm.

52:47.080 --> 52:49.040
Charles isn't a child to her, is he?

52:49.640 --> 52:50.920
He's also the Crown.

52:51.720 --> 52:55.960
A living embodiment
of who will replace her. Supersede her.

52:58.320 --> 53:00.040
Loving a child who,
through no fault of his own,

53:00.120 --> 53:02.040
represents your own death can't be easy.

53:02.120 --> 53:05.400
-No.
-Because she's a little cold with him.

53:08.200 --> 53:09.360
She tries her best.

53:10.280 --> 53:12.920
Might be nice to have a couple of kids
that are just kids.

53:13.440 --> 53:14.920
Not mortal threats.

53:15.720 --> 53:16.840
Who she can actually love.

53:19.000 --> 53:20.080
[doorbell buzzing]

53:20.160 --> 53:21.000
Ah.

53:23.040 --> 53:24.600
It's the airport driver.

53:29.720 --> 53:33.280
