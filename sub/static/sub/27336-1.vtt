00:24.040 --> 00:29.240
Trampled by the dark army of Fury
and scorched by the dragon's breath

00:29.400 --> 00:32.455
The peace and harmony
between the 12 kingdoms of

00:32.479 --> 00:35.632
Nazroth is little more
than a distant memory.

00:36.840 --> 00:40.993
Emerging from the chaos and
surrounded by the stench of death

00:41.160 --> 00:45.836
The Princess of Zaldah has survived
the destruction of her castle.

00:46.520 --> 00:50.798
Armed with a powerful dragon egg
snatched from the rubble of her castle

00:50.960 --> 00:55.670
And the knowledge that her brother
is behind the army of fury bloods

00:55.840 --> 00:57.592
She must save her people

00:57.920 --> 00:59.149
There's a war coming.

00:59.480 --> 01:03.758
Giving her strength are her most
loyal and courageous Royal Knights

01:03.920 --> 01:07.695
Joining forces with Katori
Warrior Women to stop their

01:07.720 --> 01:11.873
common enemy Prince Favian from
conquering the entire realm.

01:12.200 --> 01:15.909
Kingdoms will fall, crushed
beneath the feet of

01:15.960 --> 01:19.555
a thousand and torched
by unstoppable dragons.

01:19.760 --> 01:23.310
Out of the ashes a Kingdom will rise.

02:17.920 --> 02:18.910
H's amply

02:19.680 --> 02:20.829
Where is everyone?

03:46.760 --> 03:47.750
Stay behind me Princess

04:30.960 --> 04:32.917
Our blows only seem to slow them George.

04:34.880 --> 04:35.870
As do our Hades

04:36.160 --> 04:37.514
It's like they don't feel pain.

04:38.280 --> 04:39.918
Can weapons not harm them?

04:40.318 --> 04:41.786
They don't know their injuries.

05:05.520 --> 05:06.510
Take thew heads

05:07.760 --> 05:09.831
Then let us cut off their
heads and be done with it.

05:21.800 --> 05:22.915
So that's how we kill them.

05:24.320 --> 05:25.754
Search the building for weapons.

05:29.520 --> 05:32.478
Drag the bodies into the
barn, lock the door.

05:48.960 --> 05:51.918
How much more of that stuff are you
going to put on me? It stinks.

05:53.080 --> 05:55.435
The more we apply the faster we'll heal.

05:55.760 --> 05:56.750
Would you prefer I stop?

05:56.840 --> 05:58.592
If you put it like that.

05:58.920 --> 06:00.957
Then enough of your moaning

06:03.400 --> 06:04.993
You have a healing touch Your Highness.

06:06.040 --> 06:07.110
And a good stitch.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.150
Thank you

06:10.960 --> 06:12.560
We need to get you out of those clothes.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.992
I mean, you shouldn't look like royalty.

06:16.520 --> 06:17.999
We'll attract unwanted attention.

06:20.400 --> 06:24.439
Yes. these clothes do seem less
appropriate now than ever before.

06:25.360 --> 06:27.237
There'll be many desperate
people on the road.

06:27.760 --> 06:28.875
Not just the My

06:29.960 --> 06:31.758
Anyone could be working with Prince Favian.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.671
There'll be a high price on
your head Your Highness.

06:36.040 --> 06:38.919
I saw some clothes in the
cottages, you should gel changed

06:43.040 --> 06:45.998
How did Favian even get these eggs.

06:47.760 --> 06:49.433
And what is he using them for?

06:50.760 --> 06:52.956
I don't know but I don't like it.

06:53.320 --> 06:57.917
- There is the power in [he eggs of dragons
- No good ever came from using magic.

06:58.440 --> 07:00.556
And even having that thing
near us is bad luck.

07:02.120 --> 07:04.589
It must have something to
do with the fury bloods

07:08.720 --> 07:10.836
or maybe he's trying to
raise a dragon army.

07:13.840 --> 07:15.558
That would make him incredibly powerful.

07:16.160 --> 07:17.594
No one has ever enslaved a dragon.

07:18.240 --> 07:19.913
No ones ever found a dragons egg before

07:21.200 --> 07:22.190
What d'you mean?

07:22.760 --> 07:25.559
The dragons are believed to
live in the jagged mountains.

07:26.280 --> 07:29.238
Beyond the volcanoes and rivers
of lava, they are impossible

07:29.280 --> 07:32.159
to cross by man and the mountains
too treacherous to climb.

07:32.720 --> 07:35.712
And the seas either side
are too perilous that no

07:35.760 --> 07:38.593
ship's captain will ever
dare to navigate them.

07:40.120 --> 07:43.375
Well. we know Favian
is commanding the fury

07:43.400 --> 07:46.756
and he seeks to wrest
the throne from father.

07:48.400 --> 07:49.879
But how is he doing it'?

07:50.440 --> 07:54.274
There is another. one who
is yet to reveal himself.

07:55.360 --> 07:56.350
There must be.

07:56.920 --> 07:59.639
Favian doesn’t have the knowledge
or power to do this on his own.

08:01.360 --> 08:02.350
Or the courage

08:08.960 --> 08:09.950
What is that'?

08:11.360 --> 08:13.476
It came from the dragon
that destroyed the castle

08:15.960 --> 08:20.875
Get some sleep, at first light
we push to the Northern Castle.

08:22.240 --> 08:23.355
I'll take first watch.

08:24.120 --> 08:25.190
Wan! some company George?

08:25.720 --> 08:27.472
No, rest up old friend

11:09.005 --> 11:11.121
George. Dimia.

11:20.445 --> 11:21.560
Thank god we found ya

11:27.365 --> 11:28.514
You're the King's Knights

11:29.845 --> 11:30.835
You were at the Inn.

11:31.845 --> 11:33.165
Everyone we're safe

11:34.485 --> 11:35.600
You have to save us

11:38.405 --> 11:39.395
What happened'?

11:42.805 --> 11:48.323
Kettlage was overrun by [he restless dead
These furies

11:48.845 --> 11:50.358
Killed so many of us.

11:51.285 --> 11:55.244
We lost our daughter. Please help us.

11:55.725 --> 11:56.795
Where are you headed?

11:58.325 --> 12:02.762
To the King's Western Castle if it
pleases you ma'am. We'll be safe there.

12:03.645 --> 12:05.238
The King's army will protect us.

12:13.125 --> 12:14.115
What's wrong'?

12:17.845 --> 12:20.121
Please let us shelter within
the safety of the walls

12:20.685 --> 12:22.517
Please you have to protect us.

12:22.765 --> 12:27.236
- Please, sirs. Don't leave us to die.
- Please. please. have mercy.

12:27.565 --> 12:29.203
- We are honorable people
- Enough.

12:33.965 --> 12:35.478
The castle has been destroyed.

12:37.565 --> 12:39.078
You'll find no refuge there.

12:40.165 --> 12:41.360
All this way for nothing.

12:42.485 --> 12:44.900
Lies. They don't want to help us.
Nothing can

12:44.925 --> 12:47.485
bring down the castle walls
not even these fury.

12:48.205 --> 12:50.082
What Sir George says is true

12:50.845 --> 12:54.122
The castle was overrun
and completely destroyed

12:54.485 --> 12:58.240
You must come with us to the North Castle,
that is the only way you will be safe.

12:58.845 --> 13:00.279
What could destroy the castle?

13:03.805 --> 13:04.795
Here

13:12.925 --> 13:15.917
It's come back for the egg.

13:17.325 --> 13:18.679
Then we give it what it wants

14:27.085 --> 14:29.554
I told you all that thing would
bring us nothing but trouble.

14:34.245 --> 14:35.235
Good riddance

14:36.685 --> 14:38.244
Until it comes back again.

15:07.365 --> 15:08.594
They need lo wait here

15:10.405 --> 15:11.634
You need to see this

15:14.125 --> 15:15.399
Dimia, stay with the Princess.

15:45.405 --> 15:46.395
What's wrong'?

15:47.285 --> 15:50.801
Furies. as far as the eye can see and
they're heading straight towards us.

15:54.285 --> 15:55.275
What are we to do?

15:56.045 --> 15:58.605
We're gonna die. We're all gonna die.

15:59.525 --> 16:01.004
Ooh. we've lost everything.

16:02.685 --> 16:05.564
I knew we shouldn't have
gone this way, I told you!

16:06.325 --> 16:09.300
- Like we should have gone down to-
- I am the townsman and you do as I say.

16:09.325 --> 16:10.440
Stop fighting.

16:17.005 --> 16:18.120
Stop fighting.

16:20.845 --> 16:21.835
What are we gonna do?

16:23.525 --> 16:24.640
What are we going to do'?

16:27.445 --> 16:30.039
We're out off, there's no my through

16:32.445 --> 16:33.765
There must be thousands of them.

16:35.205 --> 16:37.276
This was the Prince's plan all along.
To surround

16:37.325 --> 16:39.396
us and finish off everyone
who's not loyal to him.

16:40.365 --> 16:43.960
How do we get to the Northern Castle?
We have to warn father.

16:44.485 --> 16:47.523
We need to protect the people of
our kingdom. of all the kingdoms.

16:47.845 --> 16:51.156
Favian wants us to bow at his
feet, we mustn’t let him win.

16:59.885 --> 17:01.364
Maybe we head back to Kalon

17:03.005 --> 17:04.075
D'you think we'll make it?

17:04.605 --> 17:06.642
Favian surely has the
Kingdom surrounded by now.

17:07.365 --> 17:09.753
I just have this sick feeling
that inside of me that we are

17:09.845 --> 17:12.233
not fighting with our Katori
sisters to the final toll

17:13.565 --> 17:16.557
As do I. But what shame do we have?

17:22.204 --> 17:23.877
These are unbearable odds George

17:25.605 --> 17:29.838
We can't go back north. Now we
can't go south. W-What now?

17:30.365 --> 17:33.357
East. To the coast and safety by the sea.

17:35.805 --> 17:37.842
No means in which to buy passage.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.796
Here. Take this

17:43.045 --> 17:45.060
Give this to the captain
of the Kings Armada.

17:45.085 --> 17:46.883
Tell him to set sail for the Red Islands.

17:47.005 --> 17:51.715
And to take you there to safety. Tell him
to remain there until he gets more orders.

17:52.045 --> 17:55.322
Just make sure that he takes the
whole Armada from the land.

17:57.765 --> 17:59.365
- You're not going to come with us?
- No!

17:59.925 --> 18:03.202
Our path leads into darkness.
You'll be safer on the seas.

18:05.405 --> 18:06.475
Let me come with you

18:10.005 --> 18:10.995
I can help.

18:11.845 --> 18:12.835
I can become a Knight

18:12.925 --> 18:15.360
To become a Knight takes years
of dedication and training.

18:16.165 --> 18:17.200
We began at childhood.

18:18.645 --> 18:22.559
You're a townsman, your
responsibility is to these people.

18:25.805 --> 18:28.115
- But you take Katori with you.
- I said no.

18:30.365 --> 18:32.959
It's. err. it's Bryce.
it's Bryce isn't it'?

18:33.765 --> 18:37.520
Part of being a Knight is obeying orders even
if those orders are disagreeable to you.

18:39.365 --> 18:41.045
What is the best way to get to the castle?

18:42.605 --> 18:44.039
We go through The Dark Kingdom.

18:48.725 --> 18:50.921
The Dark Kingdom is an evil place.

18:51.405 --> 18:53.715
No-one of sane mind has
ventured into that land.

18:53.765 --> 18:55.199
H's the mos! direct mute

18:55.685 --> 18:59.041
The fury are closing in, we have no choice.

18:59.325 --> 19:02.124
But George... The Dark Kingdom...

19:03.245 --> 19:05.805
No-one has ever survived The Dark Kingdom.

19:18.285 --> 19:22.165
The air is thick with whispers,
talk of overthrowing the King

19:22.325 --> 19:25.875
Ssssh. the very bricks of this
castle listen for deceit.

19:26.245 --> 19:30.398
The bricks may Helen bu! so do
I, there are changes coming.

19:30.525 --> 19:34.041
You speak of treason. You want us killed'?

20:24.485 --> 20:27.045
Your Majesty, you wished
to hear the report.

20:31.565 --> 20:32.555
Your majesty?

20:34.725 --> 20:35.760
Forgive me Commander.

20:37.445 --> 20:39.959
My mind is with my wife, the Queen

20:42.005 --> 20:43.916
I fear she gets weaker by the day

20:45.725 --> 20:46.760
You were saying}

20:47.685 --> 20:49.961
We have not had word
from the Western Castle.

20:50.565 --> 20:53.364
The messenger's um! we
sen! has not returned and

20:53.405 --> 20:55.874
we fear for the Prince
and Princess' safety.

20:56.605 --> 20:57.640
Their safely?

20:59.325 --> 21:01.123
But we sent a whole battalion there?

21:02.005 --> 21:05.202
What if George and his
men weren't successful?

21:06.765 --> 21:09.200
What if the dragon has
destroyed [he castle?

21:11.685 --> 21:12.800
What of my daughter'?

21:14.325 --> 21:15.838
What if... if...

21:20.365 --> 21:21.719
No need to worry Father.

21:22.525 --> 21:26.803
The Western Castle is safe and
secure as am I and sister.

21:27.285 --> 21:28.275
Favian.

21:29.165 --> 21:30.599
What are you doing here?

21:31.645 --> 21:34.398
wanted lo be close to you and mother

21:35.645 --> 21:37.044
Where is the battalion.

21:37.445 --> 21:40.900
I do not need any battalion
to hide behind Father.

21:40.925 --> 21:44.202
I would brave any danger
to be at Mothers side.

21:45.405 --> 21:49.160
The battalion remains with
the people at the castle.

21:50.205 --> 21:53.323
An old heart warms with
your gallantry my son.

21:56.805 --> 21:58.034
But Favian...

22:00.285 --> 22:02.276
Where is Elizabeth?

22:03.365 --> 22:05.641
Do you believe all the stories
of The Dark Kingdom?

22:06.405 --> 22:08.078
They're not just stories Your Highness.

22:09.285 --> 22:11.196
Those who have ventured
in have never returned.

22:12.125 --> 22:13.274
Only their screams.

22:13.965 --> 22:14.955
M's true

22:15.725 --> 22:18.001
The Katori know of many
souls lost to that place.

22:18.605 --> 22:20.357
What are these myths you tell of?

22:21.205 --> 22:25.756
Myths! Huh! The legend tells of a
sorcery by the name of the Magister.

22:25.965 --> 22:28.878
And he descended into the
deepest and darkest valley.

22:29.285 --> 22:35.042
Once he was there he used his powers to create
such abhorrent abominations of creatures

22:35.605 --> 22:39.155
The strange mist fell on the land
and for two hundred years the name

22:39.205 --> 22:42.561
'The Dark Kingdom' has struck fear
in the heart of the innocents.

22:43.765 --> 22:46.598
And yet. that is where we are headed.

22:47.325 --> 22:49.441
Bu! it can! be (me, can it?

22:50.245 --> 22:51.804
That is the stuff of nightmares.

22:52.965 --> 22:56.595
No-one knows, no-one living anyway

23:50.845 --> 23:52.438
Maul you to leach me how to fight

23:56.565 --> 23:59.318
if half the legends are true
I'll need to be of better use.

24:00.365 --> 24:01.355
As you wish.

24:04.245 --> 24:05.519
Richard, swords

24:13.725 --> 24:16.763
Take the sword. Hold it like this.

24:17.565 --> 24:19.954
It has to become part of
you, not something you hold.

24:20.005 --> 24:22.042
Let the weight move with
you. not against you.

24:24.085 --> 24:25.917
Now draw it into your
body and lean forward.

24:28.605 --> 24:31.199
Many attacker will charge you down.
With the blade

24:31.245 --> 24:33.555
in this position. it'll
surely find its mark.

24:34.605 --> 24:36.437
From here, you defend

24:40.725 --> 24:41.715
Good

24:42.925 --> 24:43.915
You ready?

24:47.325 --> 24:48.315
Good

24:49.045 --> 24:51.400
Use your body and footwork
to avoid the News.

24:53.645 --> 24:54.635
Show me

24:56.605 --> 24:57.595
Attack

25:00.605 --> 25:01.595
Try.

25:05.565 --> 25:06.555
Good

26:34.165 --> 26:35.564
Sirens!

26:38.285 --> 26:44.076
Fish. Fishy Puh. Tuh.. Sc good

27:46.845 --> 27:48.961
There's been something I've
been meaning to tell you.

27:49.365 --> 27:50.355
Goon

27:51.845 --> 27:53.677
The stable girl I talked of...

27:54.245 --> 27:56.316
Elizabeth and I we-

27:56.605 --> 27:57.800
I know.

27:59.125 --> 28:00.195
How long have you known'?

28:00.565 --> 28:03.034
I wasn't sure until we were
in the castle two nights ago.

28:04.005 --> 28:08.795
It wasn't supposed to happen. A Knight and
a Princess. that's why I kept it a secret.

28:09.045 --> 28:10.683
There'll be many that will disapprove.

28:11.365 --> 28:12.514
But not you my friend?

28:12.805 --> 28:17.800
No. But we have a treacherous road
ahead, you must have a clear head.

28:20.725 --> 28:22.716
You weren't asleep last night, were you'?

28:23.285 --> 28:24.639
No.

28:25.205 --> 28:28.675
Always protecting me. even from myself.

28:28.805 --> 28:31.240
Always Sir. Always.

28:58.125 --> 29:02.801
Do you think the King
suspects anything is amiss?

29:03.245 --> 29:04.724
It's possible My Lord.

29:05.005 --> 29:05.995
Possible?

29:06.525 --> 29:08.482
Instruct the Magister...

29:09.765 --> 29:12.120
To have our Furies ready

29:12.765 --> 29:15.598
To stand outside the castle gates

29:16.205 --> 29:22.395
We must ensure that my dear
sister and her beloved Knights...

29:23.125 --> 29:24.115
Are finished.

29:25.165 --> 29:29.238
There is still no sign of her,
nor of Sir George or Sir Richard.

29:29.845 --> 29:32.519
Wan! them found

29:33.725 --> 29:37.434
Tell the Magister to send
Furies that have known them.

29:38.565 --> 29:44.277
Anyone turned that knows how
these Knights think find

29:45.565 --> 29:48.159
And destroy them

29:48.365 --> 29:50.003
As you command My Lord

29:53.485 --> 29:54.475
What is it?

29:55.005 --> 29:59.203
Nothing. I hear no birds. No animals.

29:59.845 --> 30:00.960
No insects

30:02.125 --> 30:03.115
We're here

30:04.205 --> 30:06.116
The threshold of The Dark Kingdom.

30:07.005 --> 30:08.882
A place of no! day nor night

30:09.365 --> 30:10.400
I don't like it.

30:12.045 --> 30:13.274
None of us do

30:14.925 --> 30:15.915
Whatta we do now?

30:18.885 --> 30:22.321
Prepare yourselves, once we cross the
boundary there'll be no turning back.

30:30.885 --> 30:32.034
Are you ready Knight?

30:33.205 --> 30:35.845
I could have died happy in
the arms of that Siren.

30:36.445 --> 30:37.799
We move quickly and quietly.

30:38.645 --> 30:40.443
We mustn't attract any attention.

31:20.005 --> 31:20.995
What is it?

31:23.245 --> 31:26.044
Large Heavy

31:27.005 --> 31:29.076
Tracks are maybe two or three hours old.

31:31.965 --> 31:33.035
H's a Demon

31:34.885 --> 31:39.118
Mailers not. The tracks lead in
the other direction. Let's go.

31:46.885 --> 31:49.001
The Kingdom is overrun with Fury

31:50.005 --> 31:52.315
Fury' those are just stones

31:52.605 --> 31:57.156
Ne. Ne, no, no they're real. They
killed my daughter. And my husband

31:58.685 --> 31:59.675
M's true

32:00.205 --> 32:03.197
Our Village and the Western
Castle have been destroyed.

32:04.445 --> 32:05.799
Where are the King's messengers?

32:06.005 --> 32:07.200
Likely killed.

32:08.645 --> 32:11.717
The Royal Knights, they
told me to give you this.

32:13.725 --> 32:14.700
Please.

32:14.725 --> 32:16.124
You must help us.

32:16.325 --> 32:19.955
They said to set sail for The Red Islands.

32:20.285 --> 32:21.275
Captain?

32:26.845 --> 32:28.119
Whose blood is this?

32:28.925 --> 32:30.245
My husband's.

32:31.685 --> 32:37.363
He's just... he was just an Inn Keeper
and he couldn't fight off these Fury.

32:38.205 --> 32:39.559
We has! everything

32:41.165 --> 32:43.884
We have our orders We make haste

32:44.645 --> 32:45.999
For The Red Islands

33:09.245 --> 33:10.235
What is it?

33:10.645 --> 33:11.635
We're being watched

33:11.725 --> 33:12.840
Take cover.

33:48.325 --> 33:50.157
Let': leave before that thing comes back

33:53.125 --> 33:54.445
What ms that?

33:55.045 --> 34:00.723
I do not know, nor do I care to know. Nor do
I wish to find out what it was afraid of.

34:01.205 --> 34:03.003
That's what we all should be afraid of.

34:03.765 --> 34:04.835
This is magic

34:06.125 --> 34:07.604
Let's get out of this place.

34:21.925 --> 34:26.362
Search your rotten minds, seek
out your old commander George.

34:26.685 --> 34:31.839
Find him and the Princess wherever they
hide. Do not rest until they are dead.

34:40.645 --> 34:42.362
I can't believe Bryce left us.

34:42.525 --> 34:45.277
He's selfish, some townsman he is

34:45.605 --> 34:47.118
He has his own demons.

34:47.405 --> 34:50.362
I'll need you to come to the
Captain and tell us why we are

34:50.405 --> 34:53.158
headed for The Red Islands and
my we have you on board

35:02.485 --> 35:04.556
You must tell me about these Fury.

35:04.965 --> 35:08.083
- Look, we have run for our lives.
- The Knights told us to come to you.

35:08.365 --> 35:10.003
To protect the people of Xaldah.

35:11.605 --> 35:17.601
We're on the brink and only our actions
will ensure the future of our Kingdom.

36:19.925 --> 36:21.324
You wish to see me Father.

36:24.925 --> 36:27.565
It is customary to knock before you enter.

36:28.245 --> 36:31.636
Your messenger said it was
urgent so no time to waste

36:34.165 --> 36:37.044
I prefer to stand and take in the room.

36:39.205 --> 36:40.275
Sit.

36:49.485 --> 36:51.442
There is something you are not telling me.

36:58.605 --> 37:03.281
As far as I am aware, the castle is intact.

37:04.565 --> 37:08.479
And why would the castle not he intact?

37:13.125 --> 37:16.038
Magic. I can smell it.

37:24.445 --> 37:27.085
Ssssssh.

37:27.245 --> 37:28.235
You hear that?

37:30.125 --> 37:31.559
Sounds like a rock slide.

37:34.005 --> 37:35.234
We have lo push forward

38:23.525 --> 38:24.595
Keep moving

38:27.245 --> 38:28.918
We're going to get crushed.

38:41.805 --> 38:42.795
Form up

38:43.125 --> 38:45.165
What good are our weapons
going to be against that'?

38:45.325 --> 38:47.601
Stop it. You're just annoying it.

38:47.685 --> 38:48.675
Elizabeth. No.

38:49.125 --> 38:50.524
- He'll kill her.
- Wait.

38:52.445 --> 38:53.435
Wan

38:59.165 --> 39:04.365
You're treading on my home

39:04.645 --> 39:05.760
Forgive us.

39:07.165 --> 39:08.439
We did not know

39:09.085 --> 39:15.275
Our land has been destroyed and we are
trying to find safety. We mean you no harm.

39:16.445 --> 39:19.039
Drop your weapons

39:44.085 --> 39:46.042
Careful

39:46.605 --> 39:50.758
This mean place.

39:52.565 --> 39:54.158
Thank you for your kindness

39:56.885 --> 40:00.594
Kind-ness.

40:29.045 --> 40:30.080
Well that was weird.

40:30.165 --> 40:32.460
We were all ready to fight
but all it took was a

40:32.485 --> 40:34.761
moment of softness from
the Princess to stop it.

40:35.765 --> 40:37.563
Elizabeth. please never do that again.

40:39.765 --> 40:42.564
It's alright George. You can trust me.

40:42.845 --> 40:45.155
The story was of rocks moving with intent

40:45.605 --> 40:47.403
The rocks were actually alive.

40:48.245 --> 40:51.124
Maybe we should be more mindful of
the interpretations of the legends.

40:51.765 --> 40:58.114
Yeah. Of course. Now. my friends.
please can we get out of this place.

41:50.205 --> 41:55.484
His time is over. It is time I became King.

41:55.685 --> 41:58.598
What is it you would have me do My Lord?

41:59.005 --> 42:02.919
Find a way to get the Furies
within the castle walls.

42:03.045 --> 42:08.518
Maul to lake this castle within two days

42:09.885 --> 42:11.319
As you with My Lord.

42:17.925 --> 42:21.520
And you, dear sister.

42:22.485 --> 42:26.240
Where in the four comers are you?

42:39.485 --> 42:40.520
Ssssh

42:47.525 --> 42:48.674
Did anybody see that?

42:49.685 --> 42:50.800
<i>We've gm company</i>

42:51.885 --> 42:53.284
We are being Matched

43:00.325 --> 43:01.645
I've seen at least two of them.

43:04.845 --> 43:06.165
How much further George?

43:08.805 --> 43:12.275
Maybe a day. Two. But the terrain's
going to have to start going

43:12.325 --> 43:15.397
up if we're ever going to make
it out of this dark realm.

43:22.205 --> 43:27.678
This place stinks, makes my skin itch.

43:43.965 --> 43:48.243
There

44:05.245 --> 44:06.235
Quickly.

45:20.445 --> 45:22.356
She's gone.

47:08.605 --> 47:10.118
Some kind of Carnivore.

48:58.165 --> 48:59.155
Katori

49:03.925 --> 49:05.199
hm a Knight

49:32.845 --> 49:34.995
<i>Take mam Lord Rem</i>

50:36.125 --> 50:38.401
Face From

50:43.845 --> 50:45.677
A place never of day nor night

50:48.325 --> 50:50.635
A twilight of never-ending nightmares.

51:18.005 --> 51:19.234
Stop.

51:20.285 --> 51:21.275
Halt.

52:05.605 --> 52:08.165
Bring them to mm

53:41.405 --> 53:45.956
Bryce! Slayer of beasts.

53:50.445 --> 53:54.404
Bryce! Slayer of beasts!

54:00.245 --> 54:04.557
Katori. What are you doing here?

54:11.765 --> 54:13.722
It's not safe. Follow me.

54:51.005 --> 54:51.995
You did that?

54:52.885 --> 54:54.717
You managed to slay all those beasts?

54:56.045 --> 54:57.035
I did.

54:57.485 --> 54:58.634
Use caution with him.

55:08.805 --> 55:10.603
Mighty warrior you must be Bryce.

55:11.485 --> 55:12.998
To have slain all those creatures

55:15.165 --> 55:16.599
How do you know vino I am?

55:17.005 --> 55:18.962
You were singing you own praises by name.

55:32.925 --> 55:34.882
So many enemies slain

55:35.445 --> 55:36.560
Yet here you are

55:37.605 --> 55:39.562
Not so much as a scratch on you

55:41.085 --> 55:42.200
I am fast.

55:42.365 --> 55:43.480
No you're not

55:45.485 --> 55:47.123
I am a warrior.

55:48.605 --> 55:50.755
And I did kill all of those beasts.

55:52.525 --> 55:54.357
And you all should be cautious of me.

55:54.565 --> 55:55.714
Is that so'?

55:58.645 --> 56:00.795
What are you doing so far from home Bryce?

56:01.085 --> 56:02.564
I'm tracking a group of Knights.

56:03.125 --> 56:04.195
And Kalon

56:07.085 --> 56:08.200
I am have lo save them

56:09.925 --> 56:11.359
You're tracking Katori'?

56:11.765 --> 56:12.755
Liar'

56:14.325 --> 56:15.315
Who?

56:15.685 --> 56:17.642
And why would these Katori need your help?

56:18.645 --> 56:22.434
There is a dark army swarming the Kingdom.

56:24.245 --> 56:26.805
Sir George needs to know
if they are following him.

56:31.245 --> 56:34.363
These Katori. they are
the Knight's prisoners?

56:36.805 --> 56:39.923
No. They're working together.

56:40.245 --> 56:41.644
Dimia has betrayed us.

56:45.685 --> 56:48.245
A slayer such as yourself will be of use.

56:49.045 --> 56:54.119
Come Bryce. Let us find your
Knights and these Katori.

57:13.285 --> 57:18.564
Pm Reno. Lord of The Dark Kingdom
Who are you?

57:19.645 --> 57:22.717
What are you doing in my bud?

57:26.485 --> 57:27.714
We're just passing through

57:28.445 --> 57:31.403
So if you'll give us back our
weapons we'll be on our way.

57:31.645 --> 57:35.275
Be on your way?

57:35.645 --> 57:38.876
No outsider has ever entered my Kingdom

57:39.685 --> 57:42.723
No! You will stay as my guests.

57:43.445 --> 57:46.995
Your guests? Do you always
bind the hands of your guests?

57:48.685 --> 57:52.155
Who are you'? What are you doing here?

57:53.045 --> 57:55.434
We are just passing through

57:55.845 --> 57:58.405
No-one passes through here

58:01.125 --> 58:02.923
All other routes are closed to us.

58:03.285 --> 58:05.196
Bandits.

58:05.285 --> 58:08.243
Yes. You're on the run

58:09.005 --> 58:12.794
No mailer. To pass through here is death

58:13.125 --> 58:15.740
We did not know the laws
of your land and there

58:15.765 --> 58:18.075
were none to ask. Please
just lei us pass.

58:18.485 --> 58:23.605
You're too entertaining to let you leave.

58:24.005 --> 58:28.681
You've slain many of my people and
somehow lived to enter my chamber.

58:28.885 --> 58:32.674
And dare to tell me to let you pass.

58:33.085 --> 58:35.474
- I, I, we didn't mean.
- Silence!

58:36.405 --> 58:39.124
Strip them of their armor, take them away.

58:39.445 --> 58:42.915
I will decide what to do with them.

58:55.285 --> 58:56.275
A bite or a sling?

58:56.325 --> 58:57.315
Bite.

58:57.645 --> 58:58.635
What is that'?

58:58.965 --> 59:00.981
- Where's it coming from'?
- Sssssh. Listen.

59:02.885 --> 59:04.114
Follow me, let's go.

59:05.085 --> 59:06.155
HWY

59:06.485 --> 59:07.475
It's too late.

59:07.845 --> 59:08.835
No.

59:09.085 --> 59:10.075
<i>Run.</i>

01:00:03.005 --> 01:00:03.995
Halt

01:00:05.805 --> 01:00:07.716
Maul to hear what they have lo say

01:00:08.965 --> 01:00:13.163
Retic. it is I. your master.
These are my creations.

01:00:13.325 --> 01:00:17.842
Hear me now I have [racked two
Knights and a Princess here

01:00:18.365 --> 01:00:19.514
Do you have them?

01:00:20.045 --> 01:00:21.558
A Princess?

01:00:22.205 --> 01:00:23.525
Do you have them?

01:00:24.125 --> 01:00:26.924
Possibly, what are they to you?

01:00:27.405 --> 01:00:29.157
Bring them before me

01:00:29.965 --> 01:00:30.955
No.

01:00:31.005 --> 01:00:32.962
You dare defy your master?

01:00:33.045 --> 01:00:35.321
Master? Master!

01:00:35.805 --> 01:00:39.958
You have no power here ever since you
abandoned us to serve your Prince

01:00:40.085 --> 01:00:42.804
I created you, you will obey me.

01:00:43.045 --> 01:00:45.321
MN not. None of us will

01:00:46.285 --> 01:00:48.356
I rule The Dark Kingdom now.

01:00:48.565 --> 01:00:52.115
I created you and I can destroy you.
Do not anger

01:00:52.165 --> 01:00:55.442
me or I will send my Fury
army to destroy you.

01:00:56.125 --> 01:00:59.516
You forget the army of
abominations that you

01:00:59.565 --> 01:01:02.762
left behind. They are
now mine to command.

01:01:03.605 --> 01:01:07.838
Retic. my son. I do not
want to invade your home.

01:01:08.205 --> 01:01:09.764
I know you have them

01:01:10.245 --> 01:01:12.077

- She gave you orders
- So did George.

You really though! you'd 'MN your freedom?

I'm the master of this place and
I decide who lives and who dies.

01:14:54.885 --> 01:14:56.319
Kill them all!

01:15:10.605 --> 01:15:13.420
We've searched for you
on your unsanctioned

01:15:13.445 --> 01:15:16.244
quest. You've betrayed
us for these Knights.

01:15:17.005 --> 01:15:18.154
Now you must die

01:15:33.125 --> 01:15:34.524
You will never be Queen

01:15:55.125 --> 01:16:00.279
I do not betray Katori. These
Knights saved our lives.

01:16:00.805 --> 01:16:03.035
Fight me. Or fight with us.

<i>Have “mercy.</i>

01:17:12.805 --> 01:17:15.843
Retic. We began the day as enemies.

01:17:16.965 --> 01:17:20.356
The only way we will win
the war is as allies.

01:17:24.085 --> 01:17:29.922
We all have one common enemy. We
will only defeat him together.

01:17:32.125 --> 01:17:35.083
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

01:17:41.685 --> 01:17:44.438
How long before the Fury
surround the castle?

01:17:45.445 --> 01:17:46.924
A day my Lord

01:17:47.445 --> 01:17:52.076
Well tell him to hurry up Goddammit, people
will notice the King is missing soon.

01:17:52.485 --> 01:17:53.634
As you wish.

01:17:55.485 --> 01:17:57.715
How many Dragonlings have now hatched?

01:17:59.205 --> 01:18:01.765
Maul him to make them subservient lo me

01:18:03.805 --> 01:18:09.835
I want all the Dragonlings under
my command and under my rule.

01:18:14.005 --> 01:18:18.283
Very well. I accept your
offer of an alliance.

01:18:22.405 --> 01:18:23.918
George' what about the Fury?

01:18:24.885 --> 01:18:29.118
They say if you slay the sorcery that casts
the spell. the spell is then lifted.

01:18:30.285 --> 01:18:31.275
Let us hope.

01:18:36.085 --> 01:18:43.003
Failure and disobedience is unacceptable.
You are weak and inferior creatures.

01:18:43.685 --> 01:18:50.637
I shall command my Fury army to eradicate
you. the Princess, the Kinghts. Katori...

01:18:50.965 --> 01:18:54.180
Every living thing in
The Dark Kingdom. Your

01:18:54.205 --> 01:18:57.243
existence no bugs! has
any meaning to me.

01:19:02.565 --> 01:19:07.514
Have no fear. These outsiders
see us for what we are.

01:19:08.285 --> 01:19:12.404
We are all warriors. We
have a common enemy.

01:19:13.325 --> 01:19:18.877
Our creator wishes to destroy our Kingdom
and he wishes to destroy their Kingdom.

01:19:19.485 --> 01:19:21.795
Together we strong.

01:19:23.525 --> 01:19:29.237
Together we can stop him. Assemble
the army. For tomorrow...

01:19:29.765 --> 01:19:31.244
We go lo war

01:19:39.725 --> 01:19:42.001
What have you done Favian'?

01:19:45.365 --> 01:19:49.518
The Northern Castle will soon be mine.

01:19:52.365 --> 01:19:54.720
What manner of creatures are they'?

01:20:05.685 --> 01:20:10.441
They are my creatures
They are Furies Father

01:20:11.045 --> 01:20:17.200
They are what have been stopping
messengers, killing troops...

01:20:18.445 --> 01:20:23.599
And they are what will
gain me your Kingdom.

01:20:25.645 --> 01:20:26.760
But why?

01:20:28.325 --> 01:20:29.645
Why do this?

01:20:31.605 --> 01:20:35.314
Does your thirst for power mean
you will turn my Subjects...

01:20:35.405 --> 01:20:41.924
They are not your Subjects anymore

01:20:42.805 --> 01:20:45.957
They will either accept me as their ruler.

01:20:46.565 --> 01:20:52.277
Or be destroyed by my army.

01:20:57.365 --> 01:20:58.639
Your army?

01:21:00.325 --> 01:21:03.740
No Favian'? No. What have you done'?

01:21:03.765 --> 01:21:05.915
No Favian'? No. What have you done'?

01:21:06.445 --> 01:21:09.244
Where is your sister, where is she'?
