WEBVTT

00:07.155 --> 00:08.213
Hey.

00:08.389 --> 00:11.256
Everybody, down on the floor!
Drop it. Don't move.

00:12.760 --> 00:15.127
- The safe.
- What safe?

00:17.632 --> 00:19.862
Go. Go.

00:23.338 --> 00:27.502
No panic code. Open it clean.

00:51.299 --> 00:52.323
L.AP.D.

00:53.101 --> 00:54.500
Stop!

01:03.378 --> 01:04.402
What the hell?

01:28.836 --> 01:33.603
A little madness in the spring
is wholesome even for the king.

01:34.609 --> 01:37.704
- Deeks speaks Dickinson.
- Deeks doesn't speak Dickinson.

01:37.879 --> 01:41.110
- No. Deeks is full of the Dickinson.
- That I believe.

01:41.282 --> 01:42.647
Well, I would like to know why.

01:42.817 --> 01:44.444
Because springtime is fully upon us,

01:44.619 --> 01:47.418
and with it, the age-old opportunity
to enrich one's life.

01:47.589 --> 01:50.081
Yeah? Spring break?
Aren't you a maybe little old for that?

01:50.258 --> 01:52.659
Mm-mm. Not spring break.
Spring cleaning.

01:53.127 --> 01:54.185
Every year,

01:54.362 --> 01:57.229
I disinfect my entire electronic world.
So Instagram,

01:57.398 --> 02:00.026
Twitter, DVR, iPod, Facebook,
the whole shebang.

02:00.568 --> 02:01.865
- You're on Facebook?
- Yeah.

02:02.036 --> 02:03.094
I mean, we use aliases

02:03.271 --> 02:05.740
and don't post any pictures
that would compromise us.

02:06.708 --> 02:08.472
- Us?
- Yeah. I'm on too.

02:08.643 --> 02:10.803
But unlike Deeks, my page
doesn't need to be sanitized.

02:10.945 --> 02:14.472
Wait a minute, so you special agent
ninjas don't dust off your digitals?

02:14.649 --> 02:15.810
I dust my digitals daily.

02:17.986 --> 02:19.010
Smell that?

02:19.187 --> 02:22.452
That, my friend, is Downy fresh
Facebook, so fresh and so clean.

02:22.624 --> 02:24.820
- You're deleting friends, aren't you?
- Yeah.

02:24.993 --> 02:28.019
The first casualties to go are people
that post pictures of their entrées.

02:28.196 --> 02:30.528
I've got zero tolerance
for Foodbookers.

02:30.698 --> 02:32.826
- He's talking about Eric.
- Okay. You know what?

02:33.001 --> 02:35.698
You need to climb off
your Seabiscuit there, Kensi,

02:35.870 --> 02:38.032
because you are dangling
by a thermionic thread.

02:38.206 --> 02:39.264
Uh, why?

02:39.440 --> 02:42.137
Because you post, like,
these obtuse and vague photos

02:42.310 --> 02:43.436
that elicit a response.

02:43.611 --> 02:44.942
You know what you are, Kensilina?

02:45.113 --> 02:46.911
- You're a Vaguebooker.
- A Vaguebooker?

02:47.248 --> 02:49.768
I mean, there are worse things,
but I really can't think of any.

02:49.917 --> 02:53.080
How about the dude
that dedicates 11 albums to his dog?

02:54.622 --> 02:56.590
Caught a case.
Granger's up in Ops.

03:02.664 --> 03:04.029
Uh, hey, so, um...

03:05.566 --> 03:07.806
do I seem like the type of person
who would Vaguebook?

03:08.303 --> 03:09.429
Mr. Hanna.

03:09.604 --> 03:10.628
A moment, please.

03:11.272 --> 03:13.206
Come on. I... Um.

03:17.845 --> 03:18.869
Last Tuesday.

03:19.213 --> 03:20.237
Olive Garden.

03:20.415 --> 03:22.713
I posted my Tortellini al Forno.

03:24.385 --> 03:25.648
You hit like.

03:25.920 --> 03:27.547
Did I?

03:28.122 --> 03:29.817
Take a good look, Mr. Hanna.

03:30.191 --> 03:33.058
This is a blast
from your task force past.

03:33.227 --> 03:34.251
It's the XD-8.

03:34.796 --> 03:37.493
It's the finest unmanned aerial vehicle
the Navy could buy.

03:37.899 --> 03:41.028
Valor Avionics puts a bow
on the project later this week.

03:41.202 --> 03:42.260
Better late than never.

03:42.437 --> 03:45.372
Red tape had XD-8
in near dissolution,

03:45.540 --> 03:48.202
but it was willed to completion
by Valor's chief engineer.

03:48.376 --> 03:49.866
Jessica Peyton.

03:50.044 --> 03:52.536
I was on her protection detail
in Saudi Arabia.

03:52.714 --> 03:55.911
She had control of everything on this
project, not her 10-year-old daughter.

03:56.084 --> 03:57.176
Riley.

03:58.086 --> 04:02.182
Whom, as I recall, made quite
the impression on you, yes?

04:02.357 --> 04:07.625
Yeah. She was like this little pint-sized
ball of energy and fun.

04:07.795 --> 04:09.194
She's missing, Sam.

04:10.465 --> 04:11.591
Since when?

04:12.767 --> 04:15.464
It's been several weeks.

04:16.337 --> 04:19.034
Investigators believe she was taken
by her own father.

04:19.339 --> 04:23.106
This morning, four armed men
boosted a copy of XD-8 software

04:23.277 --> 04:25.746
from Valor Avionics headquarters.

04:25.913 --> 04:29.281
This is sensitive intel that SECNAV
doesn't want listed on eBay.

04:29.584 --> 04:32.417
And you think Riley's disappearance
and the robbery are related?

04:32.587 --> 04:36.524
I think you know how I feel
about coincidences.

04:36.991 --> 04:39.187
L.A.P.D. found
the getaway van at LAX,

04:39.360 --> 04:41.556
but it was wiped clean of prints.

04:41.863 --> 04:42.887
Interestingly enough,

04:43.064 --> 04:46.056
they left behind one single Dorito

04:46.234 --> 04:49.534
and this CD booklet for a rock band.

04:53.975 --> 04:56.501
Ninety seconds from when the robbers
entered until they left.

04:56.677 --> 05:00.341
L.A.P.D. had several cars in the vicinity
and saw them as they slipped out.

05:00.515 --> 05:03.780
- And they couldn't catch them?
- They lost them in the crowd.

05:03.951 --> 05:06.716
They thought they were
there to participate in a flare mob,

05:06.888 --> 05:08.822
some kind of
spontaneous dance thing.

05:08.990 --> 05:10.583
Flash mob.

05:12.727 --> 05:13.751
Potato, "potato."

05:13.928 --> 05:18.593
There was an anonymous ad
for the flash mob posted on Craigslist.

05:19.233 --> 05:22.396
When the performers arrived, there
was a box of chrome masks waiting.

05:22.570 --> 05:24.038
They all put one on.

05:24.205 --> 05:25.604
And became the perfect decoys.

05:25.773 --> 05:27.741
XD-8's the Navy's new UAV.

05:27.909 --> 05:29.843
The project has
attracted the attention

05:30.011 --> 05:32.036
of a number of militant
and terrorist groups.

05:32.213 --> 05:34.113
Including the Tehrik-e Taliban.

05:34.282 --> 05:36.307
Wire chatter revealed
they were planning to attack

05:36.484 --> 05:38.748
the XD-8's development team.

05:38.920 --> 05:41.082
A task force was created
to protect them.

05:41.255 --> 05:42.620
I remember that.

05:42.957 --> 05:45.324
Sam, weren't you assigned
to the engineer, Jessica Peyton?

05:45.493 --> 05:47.018
And her 10-year-old daughter, Riley.

05:47.395 --> 05:49.955
Nell just sent a video.
Bring it up, Eric.

05:50.131 --> 05:52.623
We were holed up in the house
all day, every day.

05:53.501 --> 05:56.129
She wanted to learn to play the drums
her dad bought her.

05:56.304 --> 05:58.363
So I took some time
to teach her the basics.

05:58.539 --> 06:01.031
Believe it or not, she only wanted
to learn to play one song,

06:01.209 --> 06:04.235
- by one group, Together Pangea.
- Hard rock.

06:04.412 --> 06:05.470
My kind of girl.

06:05.646 --> 06:07.978
- She's MIA.
- Well, she's with her father,

06:08.149 --> 06:11.141
who'd been threatening
to leave his wife for months.

06:11.319 --> 06:14.619
There's no reason to assume Riley's
in imminent danger, Agent Hanna.

06:14.956 --> 06:17.050
Eric, bring up the evidence photos.

06:18.593 --> 06:20.288
Here's the reason.

06:20.661 --> 06:23.528
This was found under
the rear floor mat of the getaway van.

06:23.698 --> 06:25.427
"Together Pangea.”

06:26.501 --> 06:29.436
Then what is this,
if it isn't just some rock CD?

06:29.737 --> 06:32.331
It's a little girl's SOS.

06:38.479 --> 06:41.414
I didn't even know what had happened
until after the shots were fired.

06:41.582 --> 06:43.380
TEC-9 is quite a wake-up call.

06:43.551 --> 06:45.815
Well, fortunately,
they only got the software.

06:45.987 --> 06:48.147
The physical XD-8 was assembled
here in our main hangar

06:48.289 --> 06:49.984
then shipped down
to San Diego last week.

06:50.157 --> 06:52.251
- Camp Pendleton?
- Yeah. Secured by Bravo Company

06:52.426 --> 06:54.292
in Area 31.

06:57.398 --> 06:58.661
There she is, Sam.

06:58.833 --> 07:00.995
Just as flawless
as when we delivered her.

07:01.335 --> 07:04.134
- Your software is missing, Jessica.
- Yeah. Only a beta version.

07:04.639 --> 07:07.336
We've already rewritten most of
the code, rendering it obsolete.

07:07.508 --> 07:09.203
Plus, they don't have the hardware.

07:09.377 --> 07:11.971
And even if they did,
the XD-8 has a built-in fail-safe.

07:12.547 --> 07:14.427
It only launches after a retina scan
or verifies

07:14.582 --> 07:17.108
that the user is a principal engineer
with our development team.

07:17.285 --> 07:20.687
So as you can see, guys,
in reality, they have nothing.

07:20.855 --> 07:21.879
Maybe not.

07:22.957 --> 07:24.677
But we believe your daughter's
disappearance

07:24.825 --> 07:26.418
may be related to the robbery.

07:26.594 --> 07:29.564
Agent Callen, Riley's with her father,
Ben, back east.

07:29.730 --> 07:31.596
Safe and sound. Believe me.

07:31.766 --> 07:35.100
Jessica, you filed a police report saying
your husband took her without consent.

07:35.269 --> 07:36.464
I was angry.

07:36.637 --> 07:38.071
But then Ben explained himself.

07:38.806 --> 07:41.173
She's in good hands.
He's a great father.

07:41.342 --> 07:43.572
We just weren't meant
to be a couple.

07:43.911 --> 07:46.437
You haven't spoken to Ben or Riley
since he took her back east?

07:46.614 --> 07:49.208
No. For Riley's protection.

07:49.383 --> 07:51.112
I don't even have a phone number.

07:51.285 --> 07:52.810
This project's
put our lives in danger,

07:52.987 --> 07:55.183
so I knew deep down,
she'd be safer with Ben.

07:56.057 --> 08:00.551
He's homeschooling her, they're living
under aliases far away from here.

08:00.728 --> 08:02.696
It's just temporary, Sam.

08:03.497 --> 08:07.491
Ben sends Jess a letter every week
to check in. Just no return address.

08:08.836 --> 08:11.498
Unfortunately, the project's
had a few setbacks,

08:11.672 --> 08:14.112
but we're finally wrapping up
and they'll be coming home soon.

08:30.424 --> 08:34.087
So all the radio station presets
in my Caddy?

08:34.260 --> 08:35.956
- They're changed.
- Decontaminated.

08:36.130 --> 08:38.394
A man can only stomach
so much Michael Bublé.

08:38.566 --> 08:40.926
Coming from the guy who has the
Josh Groban Christmas album.

08:41.068 --> 08:42.592
- Easy, tiger.
- Yeah.

08:42.770 --> 08:45.137
Eric said 200 chrome masks
were delivered here.

08:45.306 --> 08:46.398
Edgar Ramirez.

08:46.574 --> 08:49.134
Probably cost more than
his whole mortgage.

08:51.412 --> 08:54.074
Mr. Ramirez. Federal agents.

08:56.884 --> 08:59.080
Mr. Ramirez?

09:03.090 --> 09:04.285
There's one on the floor.

09:05.826 --> 09:08.761
One, two, three.

09:14.935 --> 09:16.266
Clear.

09:17.972 --> 09:19.804
Kens. Go, go, go!

09:35.256 --> 09:36.519
You okay?

09:36.691 --> 09:37.920
Yeah.

09:48.534 --> 09:52.095
Looks like Kid Rock's
throwing a very disorganized yard sale.

09:52.271 --> 09:53.761
Kid Rock? Really?

09:53.940 --> 09:55.374
Okay, rule numero uno,

09:55.541 --> 09:58.203
when a hero saves your life,
you can't make fun of the said hero.

09:58.378 --> 10:00.938
Um, I'm not sure you saved my life,
per se.

10:01.114 --> 10:03.412
Okay, well, let's just do
the math then, per se.

10:03.583 --> 10:05.779
One triggered IED,
one clueless person

10:05.952 --> 10:07.647
equals two people still breathing.

10:07.820 --> 10:08.981
Okay, fine, maybe you did,

10:09.155 --> 10:12.489
but I think we both know that you
owed me about a dozen already.

10:17.230 --> 10:18.425
Guys, I got a laptop.

10:18.731 --> 10:20.460
Well, kind of got a laptop.

10:24.470 --> 10:25.938
The whole place was wired.

10:26.372 --> 10:29.307
They used a plastic-coated,
multi-strand stainless steel.

10:29.475 --> 10:33.309
It's really popular with people
who like to blow other people up.

10:35.081 --> 10:36.207
Sam?

10:39.419 --> 10:41.012
RDX.

10:41.187 --> 10:43.383
Like a cheaper, more accessible C4.

10:45.658 --> 10:48.059
Well, this thing's best days
are behind it.

10:48.227 --> 10:49.661
So is this right arm.

10:49.829 --> 10:52.025
Actually, it's only missing a left.

10:52.899 --> 10:54.697
And what the hell...?

11:09.715 --> 11:12.082
Holy s'mores, Batman.

11:12.251 --> 11:14.413
This gives new meaning
to fried hard drive.

11:14.587 --> 11:17.852
Well, I did a swift hard-wire to discover
a cloaked short key

11:18.024 --> 11:19.389
for user access.

11:19.559 --> 11:22.790
That's some pretty high-level security
for a personal laptop.

11:22.962 --> 11:25.021
That it is.

11:25.198 --> 11:29.533
And now I've begun
what will be a monumental restoration.

11:29.902 --> 11:32.667
Stella is going to get
her groove back.

11:32.839 --> 11:33.897
Did you say "Stella"?

11:34.307 --> 11:36.332
- Yeah, that's what I named her.
- Wow.

11:36.509 --> 11:39.945
This could end up as quite the notch
on your bedpost.

11:43.483 --> 11:44.780
- I'm gonna go now.
- Okay.

11:44.951 --> 11:46.441
Yeah.

11:56.362 --> 11:57.852
Yame Gyokuro.

11:58.498 --> 12:01.866
- Your tea, right?
- Gyo-kuro.

12:02.168 --> 12:05.399
It took me eons
to grasp the proper diction.

12:06.205 --> 12:07.764
All the more reason to drink coffee.

12:09.075 --> 12:13.876
So one unidentified fingerprint
was lifted from the CD booklet.

12:14.046 --> 12:16.105
It could belong to Riley Peyton.

12:16.282 --> 12:17.841
Or 7 billion other people.

12:18.017 --> 12:22.045
You feel Agent Hanna
may be reaching a bit on this one?

12:22.555 --> 12:23.886
What do you think?

12:25.091 --> 12:28.959
I think his track record
gives him a little leeway.

12:31.931 --> 12:35.231
Until it adversely affects the course
of the investigation.

12:36.702 --> 12:38.397
I mean,
even for the greatest agents,

12:38.571 --> 12:40.835
emotion proves to be
the enemy of truth.

12:42.074 --> 12:44.736
Are you reading Dostoyevsky again,
Owen?

12:47.079 --> 12:49.309
John le Carré.

12:49.482 --> 12:51.883
Arm's on the way to the lab
to be ID'd.

12:52.051 --> 12:53.678
Good.

12:55.588 --> 12:57.420
Granger doesn't seem convinced.

12:57.590 --> 13:00.287
Riley Peyton's disappearance
is related to any of this.

13:01.060 --> 13:03.688
Wouldn't be the first time
Granger's been wrong.

13:03.863 --> 13:06.958
Probably thinks that
since it's an old van,

13:07.133 --> 13:08.931
rental, lot of people
cycling through it,

13:09.101 --> 13:13.004
that CD booklet could've ended up
there for any number of reasons.

13:13.539 --> 13:15.379
Granger's really
thought all this through, huh?

13:16.642 --> 13:17.768
He has.

13:17.944 --> 13:19.935
Well, I would start
by reminding Granger

13:20.413 --> 13:22.780
that the van was wiped clean.

13:23.182 --> 13:26.345
And they missed the booklet
because it was wedged under a mat.

13:26.852 --> 13:29.378
I'd also tell Granger
that I can feel it in my gut

13:29.689 --> 13:31.987
that Riley needs our help.

13:33.259 --> 13:35.057
What do you think Granger
would say to that?

13:35.695 --> 13:37.356
I don't know.

13:38.331 --> 13:39.526
But I say we go find her.

13:45.304 --> 13:48.740
If Sam's right, Jessica Peyton's job
has put her daughter at risk.

13:48.908 --> 13:50.967
I just... I can't imagine.

13:51.143 --> 13:54.511
Seriously. Kind of makes you wonder
if it's even worth it, you know?

13:54.680 --> 13:56.876
The having kids.

13:57.049 --> 14:00.178
- I thought you liked kids.
- No, I do. I love kids.

14:00.353 --> 14:01.980
Just, you know, other people's kids.

14:02.154 --> 14:03.747
You don't want your own someday?

14:04.323 --> 14:05.984
I mean, I thought that I did.

14:06.158 --> 14:10.186
You know, and then there's, you know,
there's things like this, so...

14:10.496 --> 14:12.487
What? Things like what?
What's this?

14:12.665 --> 14:14.997
You know, things like this case,
this situation.

14:15.167 --> 14:17.607
That's the whole thing, when
I was undercover, I was fearless.

14:17.737 --> 14:19.171
You know why that was?

14:19.338 --> 14:20.897
You didn't have to
worry about anybody?

14:21.073 --> 14:23.073
Yeah, because I was on my own,
you don't have to...

14:23.175 --> 14:25.576
Nobody has any control over you
when you're on your own.

14:25.978 --> 14:29.676
That's true, but then again, you don't
have anybody looking after you, either.

14:29.849 --> 14:31.078
No one's got your back.

14:31.517 --> 14:34.418
- Oh, my God.
- What?

14:34.587 --> 14:37.784
I just realized
you're the yin in my yang.

14:38.691 --> 14:40.557
So to speak.

14:40.860 --> 14:42.885
Explain to me
how you have this capability

14:43.062 --> 14:44.894
of making everything
sound so wrong.

14:45.064 --> 14:48.034
It's a gift, isn't it? I'm just saying,
like, you're the right to my wrong.

14:48.200 --> 14:49.565
I'm like the good to your evil.

14:49.735 --> 14:51.726
- The Beast to my Beauty?
- That's hurtful.

14:51.904 --> 14:53.668
Guys, I got something.

14:53.839 --> 14:56.159
I just finished the post-mortem
resuscitation on the laptop

14:56.309 --> 14:58.509
- you found at the trailer.
- Does it belong to Ramirez?

14:58.644 --> 15:00.544
- I don't know yet.
- What did you resuscitate?

15:00.713 --> 15:02.272
This.

15:03.549 --> 15:06.382
I am Riley Peyton.

15:06.752 --> 15:08.151
Lam 10 years old.

15:09.855 --> 15:12.825
My father is Ben Peyton.

15:13.693 --> 15:14.956
We are kidnapped.

15:15.361 --> 15:17.386
Oh, my God. Sam was right.

15:17.563 --> 15:19.156
The men say...

15:20.800 --> 15:23.030
they'll kill us

15:23.369 --> 15:25.337
if you don't give them
what they want.

15:25.671 --> 15:26.951
Do we have a time stamp on this?

15:27.373 --> 15:28.431
Nine days ago.

15:28.607 --> 15:29.972
- Location?
- No.

15:30.142 --> 15:32.270
- Sorry.
- Please.

15:32.945 --> 15:34.970
Do exactly as they say.

15:37.583 --> 15:39.813
Or we'll die.

15:55.500 --> 15:56.797
We need help.

15:57.201 --> 15:58.862
Please.

15:59.037 --> 16:01.301
Do exactly as they say.

16:03.575 --> 16:06.374
We need help.

16:07.946 --> 16:09.141
Or we'll die.

16:14.986 --> 16:17.011
I am Riley Peyton.

16:17.188 --> 16:19.680
If there's anything in there,
Eric and Nell will find it.

16:22.060 --> 16:24.893
My father is Ben Peyton.

16:25.797 --> 16:26.855
We are kidnapped.

16:27.031 --> 16:30.057
- You ever meet Ben Peyton?
- Yeah.

16:30.668 --> 16:31.760
Once.

16:32.437 --> 16:33.495
And?

16:34.539 --> 16:36.371
He was nice.

16:36.808 --> 16:38.537
He was odd.

16:39.510 --> 16:40.671
I don't know if I trust him.

16:42.513 --> 16:43.674
And the mom?

16:44.782 --> 16:46.910
Work-obsessed.

16:47.185 --> 16:48.675
She's no mother of the year
candidate,

16:48.853 --> 16:50.821
but I don't think she knew
Riley was in danger.

16:50.989 --> 16:53.390
- So much for a mother's intuition.
- Yeah.

16:54.158 --> 16:56.786
- Listen, you got to stop...
- Watching the tape.

16:56.961 --> 16:58.793
- I know.
- Good.

16:59.764 --> 17:01.596
- Well, let's head up to...
- Go up to Ops.

17:01.766 --> 17:03.962
See what the others have.

17:04.202 --> 17:06.193
Partner's intuition?

17:07.171 --> 17:09.070
Something like that.

17:12.510 --> 17:14.035
Come on.

17:18.616 --> 17:23.554
The meat puzzle you recovered was
positively identified as Edgar Ramirez.

17:23.721 --> 17:25.314
Cause of death is still unknown.

17:25.490 --> 17:28.323
Aggravated battery last May,
several priors,

17:28.492 --> 17:31.394
violation of a restraining order,
possession of narcotics,

17:31.562 --> 17:33.257
- resisting arrest...
- He's a bad guy.

17:33.431 --> 17:34.899
We get it, Nell. What else?

17:35.066 --> 17:38.900
We ran a full-scale trace on Ramirez's
cell phone and credit cards.

17:39.070 --> 17:40.799
Turns out he was
a creature of routine.

17:40.972 --> 17:42.770
Every afternoon
for the last two weeks,

17:42.940 --> 17:46.342
he's been going to a high-end outdoor
mall right across from Valor Avionics.

17:46.911 --> 17:48.140
- Convenient.
- Right.

17:48.312 --> 17:49.837
And every day at the same time,

17:50.014 --> 17:51.814
he met with these three men
in the food court.

17:51.949 --> 17:54.975
We're not able to ID them.
The security cameras are too far away.

17:55.153 --> 17:56.643
Think they know Ramirez is dead?

17:56.821 --> 17:57.913
They do if they killed him.

17:58.089 --> 18:00.353
They got about 40 minutes
until their daily powwow.

18:00.525 --> 18:02.653
A little less, actually,
if you want to mic them.

18:02.827 --> 18:04.507
That spiffy dresser
over there on the left,

18:04.662 --> 18:08.292
he gets his shoes shined every day
at the mall before they meet.

18:09.634 --> 18:11.124
I know that look and I don't like it.

18:11.769 --> 18:12.793
Just saying.

18:16.207 --> 18:18.904
Just for the record, there is
such a thing as a shoe shine girl.

18:19.077 --> 18:20.670
Come on. Be positive.

18:21.345 --> 18:22.744
At least you get to keep the tips.

18:22.914 --> 18:24.939
No chance Hetty's gonna
let you keep that.

18:25.116 --> 18:28.711
Yeah, it's not gonna be a problem,
considering I've only earned $11 so far.

18:28.886 --> 18:32.117
You're not getting tips because your
sleeves are all stained with shoe polish.

18:32.390 --> 18:34.518
- You're a mess.
- Callen has a point, Deeks.

18:34.692 --> 18:36.172
If you can't keep your sleeves clean,

18:36.327 --> 18:38.819
why would you be able to keep your
customers' socks clean?

18:38.996 --> 18:41.761
I'm gonna go ahead and classify
that under "Good to Know."

18:44.469 --> 18:47.336
Focus. Six o'clock, Deeks.
Target's headed your way.

18:49.307 --> 18:50.832
I got him.

18:52.076 --> 18:54.636
Make sure your button camera
lands a clean shot of his face.

18:55.913 --> 18:57.608
Hey, boss.

19:01.919 --> 19:02.977
Where's Rod?

19:03.287 --> 19:05.255
Rod? Rod's out sick.

19:05.423 --> 19:07.383
But don't worry, he taught me
everything he knows.

19:07.525 --> 19:10.085
I'm in a hurry. Make it quick.

19:14.799 --> 19:15.994
His name is John Stikler.

19:16.167 --> 19:19.501
He's got a lengthy rap sheet,
mostly low-level misdemeanors.

19:19.804 --> 19:21.602
I think I got eyes
on our other two suspects.

19:21.773 --> 19:22.934
Coming in the west entrance.

19:23.875 --> 19:25.866
Come on.
You really can't ID these guys?

19:27.078 --> 19:29.513
Sorry, cameras are just too wide.

19:30.915 --> 19:32.940
So, uh, where you from, pal?

19:33.417 --> 19:34.543
Here and there.

19:34.719 --> 19:36.559
Oh, yeah?
That's outside of Albuquerque, right?

19:40.291 --> 19:42.316
It wasn't that funny.

19:42.593 --> 19:43.822
Deeks, how are we doing?

19:43.995 --> 19:46.987
Looking good and looking shiny.
Look at that, huh?

19:47.165 --> 19:49.395
You can see yourself, like a mirror.

19:49.567 --> 19:52.195
- All right, you're ready for the world.
- Unh.

19:55.139 --> 19:56.800
Not bad.

19:57.542 --> 20:00.409
- Get yourself a haircut.
- Ah!

20:00.578 --> 20:01.704
Right. Thanks, boss.

20:04.982 --> 20:06.108
Punk didn't even tip me.

20:06.284 --> 20:08.719
- What about the mic, Deeks?
- It's secure.

20:11.823 --> 20:12.881
I said 1.

20:13.591 --> 20:15.753
Relax.

20:18.196 --> 20:19.493
Hey, what's the rush?

20:19.664 --> 20:21.098
Keep your phone on.

20:33.044 --> 20:36.309
That's it?
I shined boots all day for that?

20:36.480 --> 20:38.471
No mention of Ramirez's absence.

20:39.784 --> 20:40.808
Must know he's dead.

20:41.919 --> 20:44.479
Kensi, Deeks, take him out quietly.

20:44.655 --> 20:46.020
Copy that.

20:53.164 --> 20:54.928
We got a runner.
He must've made me.

21:00.638 --> 21:02.299
What the...?

21:03.040 --> 21:04.474
Hey!

21:11.015 --> 21:13.177
Should've left a tip, John.

21:14.051 --> 21:15.746
- I want to file a complaint.
- Heh.

21:15.920 --> 21:18.080
We'll let you fill out a comment card
when you go home.

21:18.222 --> 21:20.156
- What am I being charged with?
- Treason.

21:20.324 --> 21:22.486
- Treason?
- Yeah.

21:22.660 --> 21:24.219
Been following your crew for weeks.

21:26.063 --> 21:28.532
Listen, man, I'm just the driver.

21:28.699 --> 21:30.497
I make it a point
not to ask questions.

21:31.836 --> 21:33.565
So, what,
you're like Uber for criminals?

21:35.473 --> 21:38.636
Hey. You know this guy?

21:39.210 --> 21:41.178
Nope. Who is he?

21:41.545 --> 21:44.879
According to your cell phone records
and his dental records,

21:45.049 --> 21:47.814
his name was Edgar Ramirez.

21:48.219 --> 21:49.243
Dental records?

21:53.691 --> 21:55.557
Oh, jeez.

21:55.993 --> 21:58.587
- That's Eddie?
- That's most of him.

21:58.896 --> 22:00.227
Our guess is that you're next.

22:00.398 --> 22:04.494
Hey, man, like I said, I'm just
the driver. I don't ask questions.

22:04.869 --> 22:07.065
Eddie got me involved
with these dudes.

22:07.238 --> 22:10.105
They were looking to hire some guys
for a job, so...

22:10.274 --> 22:13.039
- Who are they?
- I don't know. I don't ask...

22:13.210 --> 22:15.144
Questions. Yeah.

22:15.313 --> 22:17.281
Well, you better start
answering some.

22:17.448 --> 22:19.007
When did you first meet them?

22:19.183 --> 22:22.084
I gave them a ride back
from Redondo Beach.

22:22.253 --> 22:25.245
- What kind of car they have you drive?
- It was a van.

22:25.423 --> 22:26.549
- Anybody with them?
- No.

22:26.724 --> 22:28.089
- What they talk about?
- Nothing.

22:28.259 --> 22:30.751
Redondo's an hour plus in traffic.
Somebody was talking.

22:30.928 --> 22:32.453
Not to me.

22:32.830 --> 22:37.267
But I heard them mention this wall,
some project they were making.

22:37.435 --> 22:39.875
They were creepy. I didn't
want them to think I was listening,

22:40.004 --> 22:43.406
so I tuned them out.
I don't need any trouble.

22:43.574 --> 22:45.201
That's too bad.

22:45.376 --> 22:47.105
Because right about now,
that's all you got.

22:50.414 --> 22:52.405
Do you think
whoever stole the XD-8 software

22:52.583 --> 22:54.210
is gonna try and build
their own drone?

22:54.385 --> 22:56.012
They stole the software
for a reason.

22:56.187 --> 22:58.554
Cartels are building
million-dollar narco-subs.

22:58.723 --> 23:00.885
What's to stop them from building
an unmanned drone?

23:01.058 --> 23:03.418
We know Hezbollah's been
partnering up with Mexican cartels,

23:03.561 --> 23:07.555
financing their terrorist activities
through drugs, counterfeiting.

23:08.699 --> 23:11.725
Joint operation to get their hands
on a UAV like the XD-8

23:11.902 --> 23:13.370
is not out of the question.

23:13.537 --> 23:16.336
That's pretty sophisticated technology
to build one from scratch.

23:18.409 --> 23:20.969
What if you knew
where to get the parts?

23:21.679 --> 23:23.579
I assure you there's only been one
XD-8 built.

23:23.748 --> 23:26.274
Yeah, but multiple replacement parts
were fabricated for it.

23:26.450 --> 23:28.350
- Yes.
- Many of which are unaccounted for.

23:28.519 --> 23:30.199
Well, inventory goes missing,
Agent Callen.

23:30.354 --> 23:32.034
It's a fact of any
manufacturing operation.

23:32.189 --> 23:34.021
Even for a top-secret weapon?

23:34.191 --> 23:37.456
Anything unaccounted for was probably
sent to Camp Pendleton for spares.

23:38.462 --> 23:40.453
Well, keep looking.
Let me know what you find.

23:40.631 --> 23:43.601
- We will keep you apprised.
- Thank you, major.

23:44.935 --> 23:47.700
Camp Pendleton received
less than half of the listed inventory.

23:48.239 --> 23:51.334
I bet the parts they did receive are
probably the easiest ones to duplicate.

23:51.509 --> 23:53.409
And by letting those pieces
slip through,

23:53.577 --> 23:55.875
they delay rousing suspicion
about the rest.

23:57.581 --> 23:59.845
I would really suggest
a security upgrade, doc.

24:00.985 --> 24:02.384
We'll do that, Agent Callen.

24:03.988 --> 24:06.047
You have my card, gentlemen.

24:13.697 --> 24:16.689
They have the software
and several pieces of hardware.

24:17.168 --> 24:19.528
But they know they still can't launch
without a retinal scan

24:19.670 --> 24:21.434
from one of the
development engineers.

24:21.605 --> 24:23.801
That's where Riley
and her dad come in.

24:24.675 --> 24:27.201
They're to leverage Jessica Peyton.

24:39.956 --> 24:42.516
Emilio, how many times
do I have to tell you,

24:42.692 --> 24:45.184
- no mask, no painting?
- Sorry.

24:46.129 --> 24:47.619
Nice work, Sal.

24:48.131 --> 24:49.223
Thanks, Mrs. P.

24:51.200 --> 24:53.294
Someone has the Navy's
latest drone prototype.

24:53.469 --> 24:55.733
All they need is one of its engineers
to launch it.

24:56.606 --> 24:58.700
And for that,
they need Jessica Peyton.

25:00.343 --> 25:01.970
Think she's telling us everything?

25:02.145 --> 25:03.306
Jessica's a good lady, G.

25:04.047 --> 25:07.813
Her and her husband started this gang
outreach program over six years ago.

25:08.084 --> 25:10.416
They've helped hundreds of kids.

25:10.586 --> 25:12.850
It was a simple yes or no question.

25:13.823 --> 25:14.881
I'm not a simple person.

25:19.662 --> 25:21.061
Nell's monitoring Peyton's cell.

25:21.230 --> 25:24.063
So far, no calls or texts. And Eric's
got eyes on the neighborhood.

25:24.233 --> 25:26.395
What are we waiting for?

25:32.408 --> 25:35.844
What's going on?
Why are you guys here?

25:36.245 --> 25:38.475
It's about your husband
and your daughter.

25:38.648 --> 25:40.480
What about them?

25:40.850 --> 25:41.942
They're in serious trouble.

25:43.219 --> 25:44.812
How?

25:44.987 --> 25:47.149
My husband took every precaution.

25:47.323 --> 25:49.121
He took Riley far away.

25:49.592 --> 25:51.458
Well, unfortunately, not far enough.

25:59.669 --> 26:02.366
Two blocked calls. Hopefully,
it's them trying to contact you.

26:02.538 --> 26:06.065
I didn't pick up, but you'll be able
to trace them if they call again?

26:06.242 --> 26:07.835
We're gonna try.

26:09.579 --> 26:12.480
- What if they know I'm with you?
- We made sure we weren't followed.

26:12.648 --> 26:15.208
Tech team is gonna make it look like
your phone's in your office.

26:15.618 --> 26:17.484
Just agree to what they want.

26:17.653 --> 26:20.623
We need you to act like you believe
they're in total and complete control.

26:22.825 --> 26:24.190
Can I ask to speak to Riley?

26:30.533 --> 26:32.194
Answer it.

26:32.402 --> 26:33.927
You can do it.

26:35.471 --> 26:36.529
Hello?

26:36.706 --> 26:39.266
Ms. Peyton, I have your daughter.

26:39.442 --> 26:42.002
But you already know that,
don't you?

26:42.178 --> 26:44.340
- Are you alone?
- Yes.

26:45.248 --> 26:46.306
You're lying.

26:46.482 --> 26:49.941
No, I'm not. I'm in my office
and the door is locked.

26:50.119 --> 26:52.816
That's strange, because I'm looking
in your office right now

26:52.989 --> 26:54.582
and it appears to be empty...

26:54.757 --> 26:57.249
- Could have someone in the office.
- They could be bluffing.

26:58.761 --> 27:02.595
Are you with the two men who came
to see you at your outreach center?

27:02.765 --> 27:07.430
No. They just stopped by to ask me
about some missing equipment.

27:07.737 --> 27:08.761
Hello?

27:10.506 --> 27:13.441
Hello? Are you still there?

27:14.744 --> 27:17.645
I want to see my daughter.

27:18.848 --> 27:21.818
Then I suggest
you do exactly as I say.

27:21.984 --> 27:24.612
This is your last chance.

27:28.958 --> 27:30.392
Nell, what do you got?

27:30.560 --> 27:33.029
No luck tracing the call,
but we expected that.

27:33.196 --> 27:34.356
What about the meeting place?

27:34.497 --> 27:37.228
Qutdoor cafe, no real
surveillance cameras to speak of.

27:37.400 --> 27:40.097
- And we're running out of time.
- We're running out of options.

27:40.536 --> 27:42.527
They're gonna grab Peyton.
It's their only play.

27:43.673 --> 27:44.697
Is it?

27:45.208 --> 27:48.405
Is she the only engineer whose
retina scan can launch this thing?

27:48.578 --> 27:51.047
No. But she's the only one
whose family is missing.

27:51.214 --> 27:52.875
Maybe it's misdirection.

27:53.049 --> 27:54.983
While you guys are chasing
after Peyton's family,

27:55.151 --> 27:58.416
the terrorists grab Dr. Milhouse or one
of the principal engineers from Valor

27:58.588 --> 27:59.612
and launch the UAV.

28:01.757 --> 28:04.590
- Sam's been right so far.
- Be a hell of a time to be wrong.

28:06.062 --> 28:07.860
- Where's Hetty?
- On the phone

28:08.030 --> 28:10.727
trying to explain
why the Navy's newest UAV

28:10.900 --> 28:13.631
might make its debut flight
at the hands of terrorists.

28:13.803 --> 28:15.293
Shouldn't you be doing that?

28:15.471 --> 28:17.303
Seniority has its privileges.

28:18.040 --> 28:20.338
Besides, I figured you could use
the help in the field.

28:20.510 --> 28:21.602
Nell, you're with me.

28:21.777 --> 28:23.643
Beale, hold down the fort.

28:25.581 --> 28:27.640
Let's go bring this little girl home.

28:32.021 --> 28:34.991
Her daughter and husband
could be killed at any moment.

28:35.157 --> 28:36.625
All she can do is sit here and wait.

28:37.159 --> 28:39.526
That fifth cup of coffee
can't be helping.

28:39.695 --> 28:42.995
What? I'm just saying, the last thing
we need is for her to be wired

28:43.165 --> 28:44.758
and suddenly have to go
find a bathroom.

28:45.568 --> 28:48.196
Your brain really doesn't work
like everybody else's, does it?

28:48.371 --> 28:50.669
No. No, it doesn't.

28:50.840 --> 28:53.434
Like Steve Jobs said,
"I think different.”

28:54.143 --> 28:55.611
Don't think he was
talking about you.

28:55.778 --> 28:58.042
- Or was he?
- No, he wasn't.

28:59.515 --> 29:01.779
Still no activity on Peyton's cell.

29:04.754 --> 29:07.189
Hey, Dad.

29:07.790 --> 29:10.282
- Dad?
- Yeah.

29:12.461 --> 29:13.792
It's already been an hour.

29:13.963 --> 29:15.590
So, what,
you think we spooked them?

29:15.765 --> 29:17.494
He may just be trying to sweat her

29:17.667 --> 29:18.793
and us.

29:19.201 --> 29:20.327
They'll call her.

29:20.736 --> 29:21.828
They have to.

29:22.004 --> 29:24.837
I'm beginning to think Deeks is right
about her caffeine intake.

29:25.007 --> 29:27.567
She's getting awfully fidgety
and she keeps looking over at us.

29:27.743 --> 29:30.371
We told her ten times never to look
in any of our directions.

29:33.015 --> 29:37.145
Hi. Oh, wow. What are...? What...?
What are we doing here? What's that?

29:37.320 --> 29:40.449
I'm giving her a reason to look. It's
either that or I throw my coffee at you.

29:40.623 --> 29:42.853
Well, thank you so much
for not scalding me in the face

29:43.025 --> 29:45.392
- instead of giving me kisses.
- Ha-ha-ha.

29:48.764 --> 29:51.165
Here we go, guys.
Peyton just got her text message.

29:51.334 --> 29:53.496
"Unknown sender.

29:53.769 --> 29:56.431
294 Washington Avenue,
Los Angeles.”

29:56.606 --> 29:58.574
- Oh, that's pretty close.
- Yeah.

30:00.443 --> 30:01.604
It's an abandoned store.

30:04.880 --> 30:06.279
All right. Peyton's en route.

30:07.817 --> 30:10.081
Stick with her.
Sam and I will try and beat her there.

30:25.201 --> 30:27.966
I have a suspicion we're not the
only ones with eyes on her right now.

30:28.137 --> 30:31.232
Maintain a two-car buffer, Deeks.
Don't want to spook them now.

30:31.607 --> 30:32.631
Copy that.

30:32.808 --> 30:34.867
Do your best
to keep eyes on her, Beale.

30:35.044 --> 30:36.739
I got her.

30:38.481 --> 30:40.609
- What the hell is she doing?
- I have no idea.

30:42.418 --> 30:44.318
Eric, she pulled into some garage.

30:44.487 --> 30:45.784
That's not the address.

30:45.955 --> 30:48.117
I know, but we've still
got eyes on her.

30:52.395 --> 30:54.295
I can't access
any cameras in the garage.

31:01.737 --> 31:03.466
She's stopped.

31:06.242 --> 31:08.108
Jessica.

31:10.513 --> 31:12.379
Jessica.

31:20.156 --> 31:21.590
She ditched her car.

31:22.992 --> 31:24.824
And us.

31:55.291 --> 31:56.349
Mr. Callen?

31:57.126 --> 31:59.493
What's your status?

31:59.729 --> 32:01.595
We're screwed.

32:04.033 --> 32:05.523
What about her cell phone, Eric?

32:05.701 --> 32:08.363
It's still in the parking garage.
She must have left it in her car.

32:15.978 --> 32:17.098
Do you have eyes on her yet?

32:17.246 --> 32:18.577
We're gonna sweep the garage.

32:19.014 --> 32:21.142
- Up or down?
- Up.

32:28.224 --> 32:30.386
- Did you locate her?
- No.

32:31.327 --> 32:32.658
She must have switched cars.

32:35.798 --> 32:37.892
- Think she's in on it?
- No way.

32:38.067 --> 32:39.831
How'd she know to lose us?

32:40.002 --> 32:42.596
How's she know where the switch
was gonna take place?

32:42.772 --> 32:44.866
- They must have contacted her.
- How?

32:45.040 --> 32:46.960
She's been in our custody
since we picked her up.

32:47.109 --> 32:49.544
We were there when they called.
We're on her phone.

32:50.913 --> 32:52.403
Sam, look,

32:52.581 --> 32:54.447
I know you want to trust her.

32:54.617 --> 32:56.057
You feel like you owe it to the kid.

32:56.986 --> 32:58.454
But maybe they're not
the same thing.

32:58.621 --> 33:00.680
Somebody must have got to her
at the cafe.

33:01.390 --> 33:04.621
All right? She went right
to the garage from there.

33:04.927 --> 33:06.088
We need to backtrack.

33:06.695 --> 33:09.528
- Sam.
- What? I thought you trusted me.

33:09.698 --> 33:14.602
I do. I am trying to,
but you need to look at the facts.

33:14.770 --> 33:16.101
A little girl is in trouble.

33:16.272 --> 33:18.240
That's the only fact that matters.

33:21.377 --> 33:22.401
Okay, got it.

33:24.346 --> 33:25.370
Anything?

33:25.548 --> 33:27.141
None of the workers here
have records.

33:27.316 --> 33:30.183
We could run credit card transactions,
see if we get a hit on anybody.

33:30.352 --> 33:32.912
We had eyes on her the whole time.
Nobody spoke with her.

33:33.689 --> 33:35.783
What's with your partner?

33:37.426 --> 33:39.258
He's focused.

33:40.596 --> 33:42.564
Got any ideas?

33:43.165 --> 33:45.224
Maybe someone
wrote on her coffee cup?

33:45.401 --> 33:46.664
The employees are clean.

33:46.836 --> 33:48.964
Listen, nobody got to her, Sam.

33:49.138 --> 33:51.300
I mean, the only person
she was looking at was us

33:51.473 --> 33:52.599
and we were right there.

33:55.244 --> 33:56.769
Damn.

33:57.413 --> 33:59.814
- What?
- The wall.

34:00.549 --> 34:02.643
The damn wall.

34:03.319 --> 34:05.185
- What are you talking about?
- The graffiti.

34:05.354 --> 34:08.255
It's done by the same guys that were
tagging at Peyton's outreach center.

34:08.424 --> 34:11.860
She wasn't looking at Kensi and
Deeks, she was looking at the wall.

34:12.027 --> 34:15.929
The cell must've had some kids in the
outreach program keep an eye on her.

34:16.632 --> 34:19.862
Sign says, "1227 Ivar, ground floor."

34:20.902 --> 34:22.667
That's the address
of the parking garage.

34:23.272 --> 34:25.672
- Peyton didn't switch cars.
- They were waiting for her.

34:25.841 --> 34:27.831
Now they're taking her
to the UAV to launch it.

34:28.277 --> 34:29.335
They beat us.

34:29.511 --> 34:31.036
- Not yet.
- No?

34:31.380 --> 34:33.438
They have the software,
the hardware,

34:33.782 --> 34:36.614
Jessica Peyton and her family.
What do we got?

34:38.353 --> 34:40.049
We've got their driver.

34:41.123 --> 34:42.487
- What was the money for?
- What?

34:42.658 --> 34:45.025
- The money you were paid at the mall.
- You asked me that.

34:45.194 --> 34:48.562
I told you, to rent a truck.
Come on, guys, I'm just the driver.

34:48.731 --> 34:50.358
- Where? When?
- Transport. I don't know

34:50.532 --> 34:53.194
when or where.
They're gonna call me.

34:58.407 --> 35:00.375
Three missed calls.

35:02.244 --> 35:03.268
Call them back.

35:03.445 --> 35:05.925
- Tell them you got the truck.
- What if they don't believe me?

35:06.482 --> 35:08.602
Then you'll wish you'd blown up
with your buddy Eddie.

35:09.251 --> 35:11.345
- He wasn't my buddy.
- But he is dead.

35:24.900 --> 35:27.392
- You alone?
- Of course.

35:27.569 --> 35:29.003
Check it.

35:31.874 --> 35:33.205
It's empty.

35:33.375 --> 35:37.141
- So, what are we hauling?
- None of your concern.

35:38.180 --> 35:39.841
Open it.

35:43.352 --> 35:45.013
Check it.

35:58.934 --> 36:00.925
It's the kid from the skate park.

36:01.437 --> 36:02.529
This one too.

36:18.020 --> 36:21.581
All right, boys, let's, uh, load it up.

36:21.757 --> 36:24.385
Federal agents!
Hands where we can see them!

36:25.327 --> 36:27.557
Drop it. Down. All the way down.

36:27.997 --> 36:30.796
- On the ground.
- Turn around.

36:31.066 --> 36:32.124
Hands behind your back.

36:36.638 --> 36:37.662
Down.

36:40.743 --> 36:43.075
Hey. Where's the little girl
and her father?

36:43.245 --> 36:44.644
In the back.

36:45.347 --> 36:46.940
All the way down. Stay down.

36:47.583 --> 36:49.176
All the way down.

36:49.651 --> 36:50.914
Stay down.

36:51.086 --> 36:52.576
Put your hands behind your back.

36:52.755 --> 36:54.985
- Down.
- Stay down!

36:57.092 --> 36:58.856
Sam.

36:59.228 --> 37:00.627
- You guys okay?
- Oh, thank God.

37:00.796 --> 37:02.662
Yeah, we're okay.
What about my wife?

37:02.831 --> 37:04.663
- Ben? Riley?
- Jess?

37:04.833 --> 37:07.268
- Jess. Jess.
- Mom!

37:08.103 --> 37:12.006
I am so sorry, Riley.

37:12.274 --> 37:14.174
I love you so much, sweetie.

37:14.877 --> 37:16.641
I know.

37:16.945 --> 37:19.175
I love you too.

37:24.853 --> 37:26.844
I knew you would find us, Sam.

37:32.094 --> 37:34.426
I think this belongs to you.

37:38.967 --> 37:40.662
Keep it.

37:41.003 --> 37:42.493
For good luck.

37:44.606 --> 37:46.700
It worked for me.

37:49.878 --> 37:51.209
You made your own luck.

38:00.456 --> 38:02.447
Thank you so much.

38:02.624 --> 38:04.388
Thank you.

38:06.762 --> 38:09.527
You have time for a little jam session
this weekend?

38:13.402 --> 38:14.528
You bet.

38:15.471 --> 38:16.939
You still playing rock?

38:17.106 --> 38:18.540
I'm a one-trick pony.

38:20.275 --> 38:21.367
Work on that foot.

38:52.274 --> 38:56.677
Marine Corps recovered the stolen
XD-8 software and hardware.

38:57.546 --> 39:00.743
Yes, I've already informed
the SECNAV.

39:02.084 --> 39:06.248
- You did?
- I figured it was the least I could do.

39:06.421 --> 39:09.880
Considering the bad news
I had to give them earlier.

39:10.626 --> 39:14.119
Why?
Would you prefer to have done it?

39:14.530 --> 39:16.089
No.

39:17.933 --> 39:19.025
That's fine.

39:22.471 --> 39:24.303
I figured as much.

39:29.077 --> 39:31.136
Good night, Owen.

39:41.223 --> 39:43.487
- Buy you a drink, Sam?
- Ah.

39:44.526 --> 39:45.823
Not tonight, Kensilino.

39:45.994 --> 39:48.429
- Going home to the family.
- All right. Callen?

39:49.264 --> 39:50.288
I've actually got a date.

39:51.233 --> 39:52.723
- You?
- Mm-hm.

39:52.901 --> 39:55.393
All right.
I'll get a beer with you, partner.

39:55.571 --> 39:57.767
- To drink or post on Facebook?
- Ooh.

39:58.840 --> 40:00.467
Brewbooker.

40:03.579 --> 40:05.707
That was one time.

40:05.881 --> 40:09.044
- And how dare you, sir?
- I'm buying.

40:10.152 --> 40:11.278
Yeah.

40:11.787 --> 40:12.811
Hey.

40:14.056 --> 40:15.615
Thanks for trusting me, Mr. Callen.

40:16.425 --> 40:17.620
Thank you for being right.

40:20.262 --> 40:21.752
Here.

40:22.531 --> 40:24.090
I can't take that.

40:24.266 --> 40:25.461
She gave it to you.

40:25.634 --> 40:26.965
Now I'm giving it to you.

40:27.436 --> 40:29.200
Little birdie told me it's good luck.

40:32.140 --> 40:33.699
What am I supposed to do
with that?

40:33.976 --> 40:37.844
I don't know. Put it under your pillow.
Pass it on.

40:39.481 --> 40:41.279
You'll figure it out.

40:47.589 --> 40:49.489
Thanks, partner.
