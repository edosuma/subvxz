WEBVTT

00:04.630 --> 00:06.257
Previously on "Power"...

00:06.423 --> 00:08.721
I see potential in you, my friend.

00:08.884 --> 00:11.307
- You could replace me.
- What's going on, Tommy?

00:11.470 --> 00:15.100
Well, like you said,
we work for Milan till we don't.

00:15.265 --> 00:17.785
Andy and Alby, they swooped in
and got the deal with Karen, bro.

00:17.810 --> 00:19.561
They moved so fucking fast.

00:19.728 --> 00:22.456
If you help me out on this, I'll set you
up with the biggest bust of your career.

00:22.481 --> 00:24.199
My name's Slim.
You mind if we shoot a few?

00:24.358 --> 00:25.359
Yeah, sure.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.904
It's just a matter of time
until you're exposed.

00:28.070 --> 00:29.990
- What's this?
- It belongs to Lobos's guy, okay?

00:30.072 --> 00:33.622
Whoever the leak is at your office
was calling him on that phone.

00:33.784 --> 00:35.904
You go back to the Feds.
You tell 'em you'll help 'em.

00:35.929 --> 00:37.166
You give 'em a bigger fish.

00:37.261 --> 00:39.181
Tommy, Ghost is plotting something
against Milan.

00:39.206 --> 00:41.767
If you're working on some plan to get out,
you better fucking tell me.

00:41.792 --> 00:44.192
Got no plan, man. Don't know where
his headquarters are, man.

00:44.350 --> 00:45.750
Can you tell me where he hangs out?

00:45.775 --> 00:48.222
No.

Everything as usual,

02:40.619 --> 02:43.293
And we're looking good
from our collections, except for Ruiz.

02:43.455 --> 02:44.798
Ain't got a dime from him.

02:44.956 --> 02:47.334
Milan wants his territory
covered ASAP.

02:47.501 --> 02:48.844
I thought you had him on lock.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.754
Trust me, Ruiz is good for it,
all right?

02:50.921 --> 02:52.721
He never wanted
out of the game to begin with.

02:52.756 --> 02:54.633
He's good. He wants back in.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.080
Oh, yeah? He don't seem like it.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.474
It means he hit me up last night.

02:58.637 --> 03:01.686
He said he wanted to talk about something,
so I'm going by there later.

03:03.392 --> 03:05.992
So you talking to Ruiz now
but you can't pick up the phone for me?

03:06.103 --> 03:07.571
I mean, I hit you last night.

03:07.729 --> 03:09.697
What you find, a good piece
of pussy or something?

03:09.856 --> 03:12.826
No, I was with Milan.

03:12.984 --> 03:15.863
Brought me to his warehouse
where he keeps that designer shit.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.906
He just wanted me
to know where it was.

03:18.073 --> 03:19.791
- How'd it look?
- How did it look?

03:19.950 --> 03:24.251
It looked like a fuckin' warehouse...
made of bricks, cold, dark.

03:34.673 --> 03:36.767
Tommy, you will come
to know these men

03:36.925 --> 03:39.178
as time goes on
and you continue to show your value.

03:39.344 --> 03:40.687
Hey, Milan.

03:43.140 --> 03:45.313
Tommy is one of us now.

03:45.475 --> 03:47.398
Isn't that right?

03:51.148 --> 03:53.388
We just got to be on the same page.
You know what I mean?

03:54.943 --> 03:56.743
What I'm saying is,
if we get anything, Tommy,

03:56.768 --> 03:58.955
- we've got to make sure we talk.
- I know.

03:59.114 --> 04:00.491
Okay.

04:00.657 --> 04:02.500
The Feds step to Angela
about Lobos?

04:02.659 --> 04:04.139
Is she keeping
her fucking mouth shut?

04:04.164 --> 04:07.248
They're looking at her, yeah,
but I found something on Hugo

04:07.414 --> 04:09.712
that I think Angela could use.

04:09.875 --> 04:11.502
She'll figure it out, man.

04:11.668 --> 04:12.885
She's smart.

04:15.005 --> 04:16.803
She ain't that fucking smart.

04:18.382 --> 04:20.343
And if she was,
she never would've gotten mixed up

04:20.385 --> 04:21.637

You look... breathtaking.

06:00.569 --> 06:04.494
- It was Agent Asshole, right?
- Right.

06:04.656 --> 06:07.330
That must make you
Agent Dickhead.

06:07.492 --> 06:08.664
Tommy ain't here.

06:08.827 --> 06:12.331
Now, that's funny that you know
we're looking for your son.

06:12.497 --> 06:14.625
When's the last time you saw him?

06:20.171 --> 06:21.548

you saw him?

06:25.468 --> 06:28.096
It's been days
since I've last seen Tommy.

06:28.263 --> 06:29.640
Stubborn kid...

06:29.806 --> 06:31.524
won't let me pay him back
for the pizza.

06:31.683 --> 06:33.185
Yeah?

06:33.351 --> 06:34.871
25 bucks to pick up
two pepperoni pies.

06:34.978 --> 06:36.104
Can you believe that price?

06:36.271 --> 06:39.366
Wow, 25.
That is... that is really something.

06:39.524 --> 06:42.323
I got the receipt
around here somewhere.

06:44.696 --> 06:47.950
Take a look for yourself.

06:48.116 --> 06:49.914
Look at that.

06:54.789 --> 06:57.133
Hey, Knox.

06:58.627 --> 06:59.924
Look at the date.

07:07.302 --> 07:08.679
That's the last time
you saw Tommy?

07:08.845 --> 07:09.846
Yeah, yeah.

07:10.013 --> 07:11.765
He was here all clay,
hogging the remote.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.292
How do we know
he was here all day,

07:13.391 --> 07:15.393
that at some point
he didn't leave, come back?

07:15.560 --> 07:17.938
Well, we bought it
with his credit card.

07:18.104 --> 07:20.357
I think it's time
we got out of your hair, Ms. Egan.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.618
Sorry for the trouble.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.760
Be sure to tell Tommy
we stopped by.

07:43.672 --> 07:45.174
Just a little bit to the left...

07:45.340 --> 07:46.933
about <i>6</i> inches.

07:47.092 --> 07:48.765
Perfect.

07:48.927 --> 07:51.208
Okay, and make sure that extra signs
are posted out front.

07:51.346 --> 07:52.347
We'll take care of it.

07:52.514 --> 07:55.814
Thank you, guys.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.820
Hey, girl. What's going on?

07:58.979 --> 08:00.579
Wondering if you talked
to 'Keisha today.

08:00.604 --> 08:01.447
She ain't showed up,

08:01.606 --> 08:03.526
and ain't nobody here
covering her shift, either.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.197
You tried calling her?

08:05.360 --> 08:06.361
She ain't picking up.

08:06.528 --> 08:07.871
Probably with some nigga.

08:08.029 --> 08:10.031
You might
want to call her yourself.

08:10.198 --> 08:11.700
All right, don't worry about it.

08:11.866 --> 08:14.540
- I'll track her down. Thanks.
- Bye.

08:26.923 --> 08:28.641
- What's up, G?
- What's up, boy?

08:28.800 --> 08:31.349
- Your mom here?
- Nah. She's not home.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.433
What the hell happened
to you last night, man?

08:33.596 --> 08:35.436
You trying to get me
in trouble with your pops?

08:35.461 --> 08:36.107
Nah.

08:36.265 --> 08:37.866
Slim just came
to pick me up from school.

08:37.933 --> 08:41.234
My fault I didn't tell you about it,
but thanks for covering up for me.

08:43.231 --> 08:45.984
Well, I had you this time,
but I ain't doing that shit again, man.

08:46.151 --> 08:48.745
What'd you and Slim do?

08:48.903 --> 08:51.656
He just took me to the old neighborhood
him and my dad grew up in.

08:51.823 --> 08:53.996
I guess you, too, right?

08:54.159 --> 08:56.002
That's it?
Nothing else happened?

08:57.912 --> 08:59.505
No, nothing else.

09:02.751 --> 09:05.254
Look, man,
just be careful of Slim, okay?

09:05.420 --> 09:06.922
Why?
I thought you guys was friends.

09:07.088 --> 09:09.090
I mean, yeah, we are, but...

09:09.966 --> 09:11.684
I'm your friend first.

09:11.843 --> 09:14.562
Just saying, you ain't got to hang out
with him all the time, okay?

09:16.765 --> 09:18.438
All right.

09:21.394 --> 09:24.022
Valdes,
where you headed in such a hurry?

09:25.440 --> 09:26.942
Ladies' room. Excuse me.

09:27.108 --> 09:28.860
Hey, Valdes, did you hear?

09:29.027 --> 09:31.951
I think we're all about to be
cleared of this MJ bullshit.

09:32.113 --> 09:33.410
What happened?

09:33.573 --> 09:36.543
It looks like someone initiated
a search in the prison system

09:36.701 --> 09:37.941
related to Lobos's whereabouts.

09:37.994 --> 09:41.498
Nugget is, it was done after we told
everyone Lobos was dead.

09:41.664 --> 09:43.962
Whoever it was,
obviously wasn't one of us.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.843
Because we knew
of Lobos's location.

09:46.002 --> 09:48.362
They're trying to find
the source of the search as we speak.

09:48.387 --> 09:50.177
Once they do,
we'll all be exonerated.

09:50.340 --> 09:52.217
Can't wait.

10:02.727 --> 10:04.729
What the fuck is this
supposed to pay?

10:04.896 --> 10:06.990
What's the problem?

10:07.148 --> 10:09.668
You know this ain't gonna be enough
to cover the whole shipment.

10:09.693 --> 10:13.281
Like I said before, I'm not paying
into something that I don't believe in.

10:13.446 --> 10:17.121
Okay, just so we're all clear,

10:17.283 --> 10:21.584
you want me to bring this
to our connect in your name?

10:21.746 --> 10:23.373
You got to do what you got to do.

10:23.540 --> 10:26.419
Look, Tomas,
we got a system set in place

10:26.584 --> 10:29.383
and a clientele that expects
a certain product.

10:29.546 --> 10:31.719
It ain't easy to diversify.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.481
I'm not saying
I don't want to play ball,

10:33.550 --> 10:36.550
but I think this would be a lot easier
if I heard it from the horse's mouth.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.764
Okay. Okay.

10:42.600 --> 10:45.228
Hey, Poncho,
what you think about all this?

10:47.147 --> 10:48.694
Simple shit to me.

10:48.857 --> 10:50.617
At the end of the day,
it's still drugs, man.

10:50.783 --> 10:52.456
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Listen.

10:52.618 --> 10:55.785
I told Ruiz we should push this shit
to kids studying for exams.

10:55.947 --> 10:58.120
My nephew and his friends
stay up all night.

10:58.283 --> 11:01.708
The neighborhood is changing.
We got to keep up with the times.

11:01.870 --> 11:04.373
- Yeah.
- He ain't listening.

11:21.598 --> 11:23.066
Hey. How are you?

11:23.224 --> 11:26.945
After I told you Lobos was alive,
who did you tell?

11:27.103 --> 11:29.777
I didn't tell anyone.

11:29.939 --> 11:32.283
Whoever you told
initiated a search

11:32.442 --> 11:34.865
for Lobos's location
in the system.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.621
Who the fuck did you tell, Jamie?

11:36.779 --> 11:38.739
Because when they find him,
he's gonna give you up

11:38.764 --> 11:41.859
- and we're both fucked.
- They can't give me up, legally.

11:43.578 --> 11:45.626
Proctor?

11:45.788 --> 11:47.631
Boy, are you out of
your fucking mind?

11:47.740 --> 11:49.100
You had Proctor looking into this?

11:49.125 --> 11:51.725
Look, if they find out it's Proctor,
we're protected, okay? Fully.

11:51.750 --> 11:54.381
He'll just say after the Lobos attack,
he looked into his location

11:54.547 --> 11:56.547
to make sure that his client,
Tommy Egan, was safe.

11:56.572 --> 11:58.051
That's it.

11:58.218 --> 12:01.188
No, see, everyone thought
Lobos was dead.

12:01.346 --> 12:05.192
Lobos's location was irrelevant
unless Proctor knew he was alive,

12:05.350 --> 12:07.190
and the only people
who knew were in my office.

12:07.215 --> 12:10.280
It's a straight line...
Proctor to Tommy to you to me.

12:10.438 --> 12:12.941
Look, they can't prove
that you told me anything.

12:13.107 --> 12:14.359
They need proof.

12:14.525 --> 12:16.994
Juries don't need proof.
They need a good story.

12:17.153 --> 12:19.247
I knew Lobos was alive.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.085
We were living together,
sleeping together.

12:21.110 --> 12:23.043
They don't need a fucking map.

12:23.201 --> 12:25.044
Angela, it's under control,
all right?

12:25.203 --> 12:26.888
You were right about the Feds
going by Kate's house.

12:26.913 --> 12:28.753
They went by Kate's house.
They fucking pushed.

12:28.778 --> 12:31.255
They pushed hard, especially Greg,
but she held up.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.294
She held up because of you.

12:33.461 --> 12:36.681
There's no way, Greg isn't on
the Lobos murder task force.

12:36.839 --> 12:38.591
Greg was there.

12:40.134 --> 12:41.681
You know what he's thinking?

12:41.844 --> 12:43.562
Can you trust him?

12:43.721 --> 12:46.941
My relationship with Greg
is none of your business.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.853
I'm looking into the burner cell
you gave me, and hopefully,

12:50.019 --> 12:53.239
for all our sakes, it leads to something
that can end this whole damn thing,

12:53.398 --> 12:57.119
and I never have to see you again.

13:05.952 --> 13:07.829
I...

13:07.996 --> 13:09.873
I heard MJ and Lance
found a new lead,

13:10.039 --> 13:12.883
someone looking for Lobos
in the system.

13:13.042 --> 13:15.090
That's good news, right?

13:15.253 --> 13:16.926
Could be.

13:17.088 --> 13:18.715
Maybe they'll find the leak that way.

13:18.881 --> 13:21.760
- Perfect. Thank you.
- Welcome.

13:26.931 --> 13:30.981
I can't stop thinking about
that damn video and Jamie's alibi.

13:32.979 --> 13:35.448
Do you still think Tommy's
one of Lobos's killers?

13:35.606 --> 13:37.950
I don't know.

13:38.109 --> 13:40.862
I spoke with Kate Egan today.

13:41.029 --> 13:42.906
Medina let me come along
because I know her.

13:43.072 --> 13:44.745
I should have told you, totally.

13:44.907 --> 13:48.161
It's just everything moved
so quick, 'cause...

13:49.829 --> 13:51.251
Well, what'd she say?

13:51.414 --> 13:53.132
Well, what you'd expect,

13:53.291 --> 13:57.387
that she was with him
and eating pizza.

13:57.545 --> 13:59.138
I don't know. I... she's crazy.

13:59.297 --> 14:01.049
I... well...

14:01.215 --> 14:03.638
you know, she could be lying.
I just can't prove it.

14:09.557 --> 14:12.026
Listen...

14:15.021 --> 14:18.901
I didn't want to believe
the St. Patrick alibi,

14:19.067 --> 14:23.447
but I can't ignore
a surveillance tape.

14:23.613 --> 14:25.581
Facts are facts, so...

14:27.158 --> 14:31.755
our pursuit of St. Patrick and Egan
as the killers, it's over, so...

14:34.707 --> 14:37.085
Gonna have to find the leak
another way.

14:39.337 --> 14:41.590
But you and I,
we're gonna keep working together

14:41.756 --> 14:44.475
to clear our names, I promise.

14:44.634 --> 14:47.183
We're on the same team now.

14:58.231 --> 15:01.781
James, good to see you again.

15:01.943 --> 15:04.116
Kantos.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.169
Andy and Alby
just want the party

15:15.331 --> 15:17.333
and the cementing
of their partnership with Karen

15:17.500 --> 15:20.299
to be a community event,

15:20.461 --> 15:22.714
and, seeing as you're
part of the community,

15:22.880 --> 15:24.848
they wanted to ensure
that you're invited.

15:28.177 --> 15:29.977
This is serious?
You're working with them now?

15:30.096 --> 15:33.350
With the Bassett deal finalized,
there was a need for expansion,

15:33.516 --> 15:36.611
and with expansion came a need
for someone to run the day-to-day.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.612
Good thing I was free.

15:38.771 --> 15:42.116
I do, however,
need one little thing from you.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.949
Stern's guest list,
the one I gave you?

15:45.111 --> 15:46.738
I want it back.

15:48.698 --> 15:49.699
Why would I do that?

15:49.866 --> 15:52.710
Because I could have said

15:52.869 --> 15:55.213
so much about you,

15:55.371 --> 15:56.998
but I didn't.

16:01.085 --> 16:03.338
Yeah, so I just need that list.

16:03.504 --> 16:06.053
I understand.

16:06.215 --> 16:08.934
I'll get the list together.
You can pick it up in a few days.

16:29.113 --> 16:31.866
- Yo.
- Where we at?

16:32.033 --> 16:35.082
Yo, dude, these youngins,
they're eating this shit up.

16:36.621 --> 16:38.168
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Here you go.

16:38.331 --> 16:39.924
We'll hit the numbers you set,

16:40.082 --> 16:41.282
- couple more shifts.
- Thanks.

16:41.307 --> 16:42.502
Good work, Julito.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.386
I want you to hit me
the moment we do.

16:44.545 --> 16:46.092
All right, bro.

17:34.971 --> 17:36.769
Greg?

17:41.852 --> 17:43.445
Greg?

17:55.324 --> 17:58.248
I woke up, you were gone.

17:58.411 --> 18:00.755
I thought...

18:03.541 --> 18:06.215
I guess I'm used to people disappearing
in the middle of the night.

18:06.377 --> 18:08.129
Yeah.

18:08.296 --> 18:10.390
Well, I'm right here.

18:22.310 --> 18:24.563
Ghost asked me
where I was the other night.

18:24.729 --> 18:27.949
- What did you tell him?
- Enough not to be suspicious.

18:28.107 --> 18:31.031
I told him I came here.

18:31.193 --> 18:33.662
I think he just wants to be
involved with everything.

18:33.821 --> 18:37.416
Ghost is not the type to ask a question
without knowing the answer.

18:37.575 --> 18:39.373
He knew exactly where you were,

18:39.535 --> 18:42.630
and I know this because
Bratislav saw him following you.

18:47.126 --> 18:50.721
It's disappointing, isn't it?

18:50.880 --> 18:54.350
I like you, Tommy, but your
other half's persistence for an exit

18:54.508 --> 18:56.431
has put your potential in jeopardy.

18:56.594 --> 18:58.892
Ghost following me
don't mean he want to get out.

18:59.055 --> 19:02.355
It's him trying to figure out
what I'm doing.

19:03.559 --> 19:06.859
He's still down with your vision,
I promise you, lock and step.

19:07.021 --> 19:10.366
Maybe you're right, but either way,
from this point forward,

19:10.524 --> 19:12.572
I'm holding you responsible
for his actions,

19:12.735 --> 19:16.330
and if you cannot get him in line
and he continues looking into me,

19:16.489 --> 19:20.414
then, well,
it's back into the pit for you.

19:21.744 --> 19:24.748
And this time I will not stop
Petar and the men.

19:24.914 --> 19:26.336
I thought I was your apprentice.

19:26.499 --> 19:29.298
You are, Tommy,
but you are tethered to Ghost.

19:29.460 --> 19:32.714
Ghost is an attachment,
and attachments are bad for business

19:32.880 --> 19:34.507
if you want to stay alive.

19:34.674 --> 19:37.598
I'll handle Ghost.

19:40.137 --> 19:42.310
Hey, Bob, can you do
some digging for me?

19:42.473 --> 19:44.771
I got a serial number
of a possible burner.

19:44.934 --> 19:47.014
I was trying to find
the phone number attached to it.

19:47.039 --> 19:49.446
- A burner?
- Yeah, and the phone call, text history,

19:49.548 --> 19:50.748
you know, whatever you can do.

19:50.773 --> 19:51.916
Okay, sure.
I'll... I'll look it up.

19:51.941 --> 19:53.821
Okay, great.
I'm gonna send it to you right now.

19:53.846 --> 19:55.689
- Okay, I got it.
- All right, thanks. Bye.

20:25.433 --> 20:28.232
Sally, it's Angela Valdes, the AUSA.

20:28.394 --> 20:29.754
I helped you on the Whittier case.

20:29.812 --> 20:31.689
- Yeah, last summer.
- That's right.

20:31.856 --> 20:34.234
Could you look up
a card number for me?

20:34.400 --> 20:38.030
- I need the cardholder name.
- Of course. I-I'll try.

20:38.195 --> 20:41.369
Emailing it to you right now.

20:44.910 --> 20:47.254
- Got it.
- Great.

20:47.413 --> 20:50.713
- It was prepaid.
- Prepaid?

20:50.875 --> 20:54.175
- No purchaser name?
- That's about it.

20:54.336 --> 20:56.009
Could you tell me
where it was purchased?

20:56.172 --> 20:58.220
That'll take a while.
I'll have to get back to you.

20:58.382 --> 21:00.350
Okay, fine.

21:00.509 --> 21:02.182
Be sure to call me back.

21:02.344 --> 21:03.891
- I will.
- Thanks.

21:14.023 --> 21:16.321
I don't know
why I'm fucking surprised.

21:17.777 --> 21:18.949
What's the problem, Tommy?

21:19.111 --> 21:22.661
Milan knows that you followed me
into his warehouse the other night.

21:25.993 --> 21:27.633
You just gonna stand there
and look stupid

21:27.703 --> 21:29.183
or are you gonna be real
for a change?

21:29.342 --> 21:31.422
Look, man, you don't understand
what I'm trying to...

21:31.447 --> 21:32.382
No, you don't.

21:32.541 --> 21:35.215
Milan said he's gonna kill me
if you don't stop.

21:35.377 --> 21:39.803
He made it clear.
One more time and I'm dead.

21:41.383 --> 21:44.262
You fucking hearing me?!

21:44.428 --> 21:48.103
You willing to risk my life
to get yourself out?!

21:48.265 --> 21:52.020
I chose you over Holly.

21:53.270 --> 21:56.524
This time, motherfucker,

21:56.690 --> 21:58.533
you need to choose me.

22:04.740 --> 22:06.367
I do.

22:07.952 --> 22:10.250
I choose you, all right?
I'll leave it alone.

22:10.412 --> 22:12.881
I hope so.

22:16.794 --> 22:18.842
- Tommy.
- Yeah?

22:21.090 --> 22:25.687
Ruiz hit me up
about that payment.

22:25.845 --> 22:27.267
Look, man, I was thinking.

22:27.429 --> 22:29.189
He ain't never gonna reach
his full potential

22:29.214 --> 22:32.435
unless we set up a meet,
you know, between he and Milan.

22:32.601 --> 22:34.399
You know how that motherfucker is.

22:34.562 --> 22:36.189
Yeah, I do.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.778
We set up a little face-to-face
between he and Milan,

22:38.941 --> 22:40.989
make him feel
all fucking cozy and special.

22:41.151 --> 22:42.824
How you want to do it?

22:42.987 --> 22:44.947
You run the point on this one,
brother, all right?

22:45.030 --> 22:46.077
You take him.

22:46.240 --> 22:49.619
Better for all involved
if I just peel back on this one.

23:00.671 --> 23:02.719
<i>Okay.</i>

23:30.534 --> 23:33.583
"6'4" 204...

23:35.915 --> 23:37.417
What you got for me?

23:37.583 --> 23:39.927
So Ghost is still in good
with that Serbian motherfucker,

23:40.085 --> 23:41.928
and now they moving
some new weight... pills.

23:42.087 --> 23:43.930
I don't want none
of what they got going on

23:44.089 --> 23:46.217
as long as they fucking
with that Serbian nigga.

23:46.383 --> 23:49.182
The minute he out the picture,
I'm coming to collect.

23:49.345 --> 23:51.222
All right, bet, man.

23:52.431 --> 23:54.024
Tariq said, "What's up?“"

23:58.354 --> 24:00.314
You thought he wasn't gonna tell me
what you said?

24:00.476 --> 24:02.716
What the fuck were you doing
with him the other day, man?

24:02.741 --> 24:04.865
He said he wanted to chill,
so we did.

24:05.027 --> 24:06.904
If I was gonna cap
the little nigga,

24:07.071 --> 24:08.751
don't you think
I would've already done it?

24:10.950 --> 24:12.990
You said you was gonna teach
Ghost a history lesson.

24:13.156 --> 24:15.516
- What the fuck you mean by that?
- Sit tight, motherfucker.

24:15.541 --> 24:17.176
You'll know
when I want you to know.

24:21.502 --> 24:23.379
You thinking you should
just tell Ghost, right?

24:24.880 --> 24:27.053
What you think he's gonna do
when he learn I'm alive,

24:27.216 --> 24:29.765
in town, hanging out with his kid,

24:29.927 --> 24:32.430
and you knew the whole time?

24:35.140 --> 24:37.814
You ain't got no options, Dre.

24:37.977 --> 24:40.196
You made a choice, me.

24:40.354 --> 24:42.573
Ain't no moves left.

24:45.818 --> 24:47.912
All right, man.
Get the fuck out of here.

24:55.619 --> 24:57.417
You're not gonna flush?

24:57.579 --> 24:59.502
This a fucking joke to you?

24:59.665 --> 25:02.635
No, it's not. Sorry.

25:04.253 --> 25:06.551
You think I want to be here
in this fucking pisser,

25:06.714 --> 25:08.512
plotting and scheming
like a filthy rat?

25:08.674 --> 25:10.392
I'm a Soldado, a primera.

25:10.551 --> 25:12.519
Vibora, I get that this is tough for you.
I do.

25:12.678 --> 25:13.895
You're a man of principles.

25:14.054 --> 25:17.979
I respect that, but it was you
who reached out to me

25:18.142 --> 25:20.065
because you got
something big, right?

25:20.227 --> 25:22.776
- A meeting?
- Tonight.

25:22.938 --> 25:24.736
- With Ghost?
- With Milan.

25:24.898 --> 25:27.617
Will Ghost be there?

25:27.776 --> 25:29.995
I don't think you're following me.

25:30.154 --> 25:32.577
Getting closer to Milan is big.

25:41.123 --> 25:42.295
What the hell's that?

25:42.458 --> 25:44.756
State-of-the-art
FBI button recorder.

25:44.918 --> 25:46.638
Before the meeting,
you're gonna attach this

25:46.754 --> 25:48.256
behind the collar on your jacket.

25:48.422 --> 25:51.141
It's gonna record anything
within a 20-foot radius, all right?

25:51.300 --> 25:53.644
Now, it doesn't emit a signal,
so if you're searched,

25:53.802 --> 25:56.271
it won't be detected by a scanner.

25:56.430 --> 25:58.950
If they find that on me,
I won't make it out of that room alive.

25:59.099 --> 26:01.352
Then they better not find it.

26:01.518 --> 26:04.067
Meet me in the morning.

26:09.276 --> 26:12.405
Remember, I want St. Patrick.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.323
He shows up,
you get him on the recording.

26:14.490 --> 26:16.930
He doesn't, you make sure
that he's the topic of conversation.

26:16.955 --> 26:19.549
- All right?
- I'll see what I can do.

26:31.799 --> 26:33.301
Fuck you want?

26:33.467 --> 26:35.227
Look, man, I need
to talk to you about Tariq.

26:37.846 --> 26:40.190
Ghost got me watching him.

26:40.349 --> 26:42.229
He been talking a lot
about you lately and that,

26:42.388 --> 26:44.356
you know, everything
going on with him and Ghost

26:44.515 --> 26:45.901
and his mom, I...

26:46.063 --> 26:48.236
Bro, I just think you need
to check him out.

26:48.398 --> 26:50.400
Thanks very much,
Dr. fucking Phil.

26:50.567 --> 26:52.240
I'll be sure to talk to him.

26:52.402 --> 26:53.494
All right.

26:53.654 --> 26:56.783
Just so you know,
Tariq is family business,

26:56.949 --> 26:58.542
and you ain't family.

26:58.700 --> 27:01.020
Even though I'm the reason
why you're still walking around?

27:02.663 --> 27:04.916
You didn't know that?
Ghost didn't tell you, did he?

27:08.585 --> 27:11.304
I'm the one that heard that
the Koreans wanted to light you up.

27:11.463 --> 27:13.090
I told Ghost.

27:13.257 --> 27:14.857
So listen, Tommy,
I'm not here to fuck up

27:14.967 --> 27:17.937
whatever you got going on
or step on your toes at all, bro.

27:18.095 --> 27:21.144
I simply just want to be down
with you and Ghost. That's it.

27:22.266 --> 27:26.191
That's a nice speech, kid,
but we're done talking.

27:31.567 --> 27:34.787
Thank you again for that

27:34.945 --> 27:39.496
enlightening presentation
on otorhinolaryngology, Dr. Sullivan.

27:39.658 --> 27:43.208
Next we have Raina
and Tariq St. Patrick's father,

27:43.370 --> 27:45.543
Mr. James St. Patrick.

27:49.459 --> 27:53.589
Mr. St. Patrick is one of Manhattan's
biggest nightclub owners.

27:53.755 --> 27:55.007
Thank you for that.

27:55.174 --> 27:57.723
Hello, parents and kids.
How you guys doing?

27:57.885 --> 28:00.183
- Good.
- You sure?

28:00.345 --> 28:03.098
- Yeah.
- Thanks for having me here.

28:03.265 --> 28:06.109
The late, great Dr. Maya Angelou
once said,

28:06.268 --> 28:10.114
"You may not control all of
the events that have happened to you,

28:10.272 --> 28:13.526
but you can decide
to not be reduced by them."

28:13.692 --> 28:15.820
A question already.
Yes, young man?

28:15.986 --> 28:18.865
- You own a nightclub?
- Absolutely.

28:19.031 --> 28:20.248
I own three nightclubs.

28:20.407 --> 28:23.661
You ever have any famous people
come in the clubs, like Fetty Wap?

28:23.827 --> 28:27.627
- Odell Beckham?
- Bump that. How 'bout Beyoncé?

28:27.789 --> 28:29.837
Sure.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.630
We have had the occasional
celebrity or two come in the club.

28:33.795 --> 28:35.263
This is the secret.

28:35.422 --> 28:37.102
It's to make everyone
who comes to the club

28:37.127 --> 28:39.973
feel like a Fetty Wap or Beyoncé.

28:40.135 --> 28:41.762
A celebrity, you know?

28:41.929 --> 28:44.853
We want everybody to feel like a star
for that night, at least,

28:45.015 --> 28:48.189
and, yes, Odell Beckham
has been in the club.

28:48.352 --> 28:51.401
Your dad's awesome.
You ever been to the clubs?

28:51.563 --> 28:54.612
Yes, young beautiful lady
in the middle of the room?

28:54.775 --> 28:56.197
Is it hard running a club?

28:56.360 --> 28:58.783
- Yeah, baby girl, it's...
- Dad.

28:58.946 --> 29:00.664
Pardon me.

29:00.822 --> 29:04.167
Yes, Raina, it is hard
to run a club, but it's...

29:06.787 --> 29:09.961
it's hardest on those
who you love.

29:12.125 --> 29:14.344
Can't speak
for all the other parents here,

29:14.503 --> 29:17.256
but when I decided
to follow my dreams,

29:17.422 --> 29:19.845
it took me away from my family.

29:23.011 --> 29:25.264
And it's my fault.

29:25.430 --> 29:29.060
You know, you don't realize
the late nights and the meetings

29:29.226 --> 29:33.777
that you decide to take
instead of going home,

29:33.939 --> 29:36.362
that just extends this gap
between you and them,

29:36.525 --> 29:42.032
and, well, kids, it's a gap
that you can't fill with words.

29:43.573 --> 29:46.952
So you just do your best

29:47.119 --> 29:50.248
and show them
how important they are.

29:52.082 --> 29:53.504
Where was I?

29:53.667 --> 29:55.920
<i>Okay.</i>

29:57.045 --> 29:59.173
- You were great.
- Thank you.

30:03.343 --> 30:05.596
Gonna take this
real quick, Tash.

30:05.762 --> 30:06.763
Hello?

30:06.930 --> 30:08.557
You are one
smart son of a bitch.

30:08.724 --> 30:09.976
You were right.

30:10.142 --> 30:12.582
As soon as I reached out
to Agent Knox with news of a meeting,

30:12.607 --> 30:15.071
he tells me to meet him
in some fucking men's room

30:15.230 --> 30:19.030
and he hands me
this little recording device.

30:19.192 --> 30:20.865
You didn't meet him at the FBI?

30:21.028 --> 30:22.905
No. Restaurant, west 50s.

30:23.071 --> 30:24.539
He's running you
off the books, man.

30:24.698 --> 30:26.700
Means he'd never be able
to officially use you

30:26.867 --> 30:29.336
unless he can corroborate it
with hard proof like a recording.

30:30.829 --> 30:33.833
Knox wants me to make sure
you're mentioned on the tape.

30:33.999 --> 30:35.296
I cannot be mentioned, not once.

30:35.459 --> 30:38.929
Neither Tommy nor I can be incriminated
in any way or the deal is off.

30:39.087 --> 30:43.092
Yeah, well, that'd be a lot easier to do
if Tommy was in on the plan.

30:43.258 --> 30:45.977
You deal with Milan.
Ruiz, I'll deal with Tommy.

30:46.136 --> 30:49.060
Just make sure we're not
mentioned on the recording.

30:49.222 --> 30:51.224
Esté bien.

30:58.440 --> 31:01.068
Hey, my family.

31:01.234 --> 31:03.282
Dad, you were amazing.

31:08.617 --> 31:11.621
- AUSA Valdes.
- It's Sally.

31:11.787 --> 31:13.667
I did some research,
but I wasn't able to locate

31:13.692 --> 31:16.286
where the prepaid card
you asked about was purchased.

31:17.626 --> 31:19.970
- Angela?
- I'm here.

31:20.128 --> 31:25.259
- Thanks for getting back to me.
- Sure. Bye.

31:25.425 --> 31:28.770
You gonna talk to me or what?

31:28.929 --> 31:30.556
Sorry.

31:31.973 --> 31:35.022
Knox, seriously, I don't got
all fucking day to mess with you.

31:35.185 --> 31:38.189
- What's up?
- All right, I'm working on a hunch,

31:38.355 --> 31:40.595
but I need you to not ask me
where I got the information.

31:40.620 --> 31:42.748
Fuck that, man.
I know better than to trust you.

31:44.569 --> 31:46.663
If we solve the Lobos murder,
you solve it.

31:46.822 --> 31:49.075
I won't take any credit.

31:51.451 --> 31:53.453
- All right, what's up?
- All right.

31:53.620 --> 31:56.169
The cell that was found
on Lobos when he was killed,

31:56.331 --> 31:58.254
what was the phone number
attached to it?

32:02.504 --> 32:05.974
917-555-0155.

32:11.179 --> 32:12.906
Knox, you better spill.
What the fuck is going on?

32:12.931 --> 32:14.731
One... one more question,
then we can act like

32:14.857 --> 32:17.057
we never had this fucking
conversation, okay? I promise.

32:17.110 --> 32:21.107
Did you guys find out where the burner
ending in 0148 was purchased?

32:22.399 --> 32:23.821
Look at me.

32:23.984 --> 32:26.032
I am protecting you.

32:27.988 --> 32:31.913
- I'm gonna look it up.
- Okay. Thank you.

32:32.075 --> 32:33.702
Thank you.

32:35.871 --> 32:37.873
All right, here it is.

32:38.039 --> 32:39.632
I'll send it to you. Let's go.

32:41.835 --> 32:44.964
People think they got to go to them
fancy spots to get their kicks.

32:45.130 --> 32:47.132
When you in the hood,
this is all you need.

32:49.259 --> 32:50.979
I know Dre told you
not to hang out with me,

32:51.004 --> 32:53.355
but Dre be talking
out both sides of his mouth.

32:53.513 --> 32:54.765
I know he say he's your friend,

32:54.931 --> 32:56.979
but you can't always know
what's on his mind.

32:57.142 --> 32:59.941
- What you think?
- I told you already.

33:00.103 --> 33:01.946
I told Dre I think you're cool.

33:04.232 --> 33:07.577
Well, you got it right there.

33:07.736 --> 33:10.410
Don't let no nigga
try to talk you into how you feel.

33:12.240 --> 33:13.742
Those are clean.

33:14.743 --> 33:17.337
Man, $250 clean?

33:20.248 --> 33:21.545
It's all good.

33:21.708 --> 33:25.087
Clearly you got your mom and your dad
buying you nice shit.

33:25.253 --> 33:28.553
When I was coming up, man,
if you wanted some nice shit,

33:28.715 --> 33:30.433
you had to go and get it yourself.

33:30.592 --> 33:32.515
You used to steal 'em?

33:35.555 --> 33:38.809
That's how you showed people
you wasn't no pussy,

33:38.975 --> 33:40.855
how you let 'em know
you needed to be respected.

33:40.894 --> 33:42.521
You want people
to respect you, right?

33:48.818 --> 33:51.947
- I'm gonna step out real quick.
- Okay.

34:11.632 --> 34:13.851
Excuse me.
Can I have these in a size ten?

34:14.010 --> 34:15.853
Yeah.

34:24.980 --> 34:26.732
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

35:01.558 --> 35:04.232
Yeah, come on. Fuck this place.
Let's get out of here.

35:08.398 --> 35:09.991
- You two have a nice day.
- All right.

35:10.984 --> 35:13.344
So with this partnership,
you're gonna get one of these gems

35:13.369 --> 35:15.739
in each and every one of your hotels.

35:15.905 --> 35:17.907
It is an impressive space.

35:18.074 --> 35:20.168
Yeah, it's plush.

35:20.327 --> 35:21.927
So if you follow me,
we're gonna show you

35:21.995 --> 35:23.713
one of our
four exclusive lounges.

35:23.872 --> 35:25.352
- Okay.
- Yeah, head right over there.

35:29.169 --> 35:31.137
I'm a man of my word.

35:31.296 --> 35:33.469
I promised Simon Stern's guest list.

35:33.632 --> 35:35.384
- Where's Kantos?
- He's not here right now.

35:35.550 --> 35:36.847
He's out running errands.

35:37.010 --> 35:39.638
So do you want to swing back
later on when he's back,

35:39.804 --> 35:42.432
or do you want to have a seat
and watch us work?

35:42.599 --> 35:45.899
Pleasure to see you again, Karen.

35:46.061 --> 35:47.813
Enjoy the party tonight.

35:47.979 --> 35:50.277
NYPD!

35:50.440 --> 35:51.657
What's happening?

35:51.816 --> 35:53.784
I don't know.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

35:53.943 --> 35:54.944
Who's in charge? What...

35:55.111 --> 35:57.955
Andy Jones and Albert Tatum,
we have a warrant to search the premises.

35:58.114 --> 36:01.209
We have reason to believe there's drugs
being sold and housed in this club.

36:01.368 --> 36:03.291
Drugs?
Mate, you're... you're off your head.

36:03.453 --> 36:06.053
Right, right. I'm gonna call my solicitor
and sue you for slander.

36:06.122 --> 36:08.442
- Right away, please.
- We have no idea what this is about.

36:08.467 --> 36:12.142
But we can assure you we have never
nor currently allow drugs in this club.

36:14.214 --> 36:15.357
We have no idea
how that got in there.

36:15.382 --> 36:16.599
Karen, Karen, Karen! No, no...

36:16.758 --> 36:17.901
We have no idea how
that got in there.

36:17.926 --> 36:19.069
You have
the right to remain silent.

36:19.094 --> 36:21.071
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

36:21.096 --> 36:22.280
You have the right to an attorney.

36:22.305 --> 36:24.785
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be provided for you.

36:24.944 --> 36:26.344
- Take 'em out.
- Let's go. Come on.

36:26.445 --> 36:29.063
This isn't over.

36:29.192 --> 36:30.872
- Hey, don't... don't...
- This is a setup.

36:30.897 --> 36:32.490
A setup is what it is, mate.

36:32.649 --> 36:35.198
That's a pity, right?
What a shame.

36:35.360 --> 36:38.113
But there's always
a silver lining, Karen.

36:38.279 --> 36:40.577
Yeah, forgive me
if I don't share your optimism

36:40.740 --> 36:42.913
for this moment,
Mr. St. Patrick.

36:44.994 --> 36:47.668
An exclusive black-tie event
at my club in a few days,

36:47.831 --> 36:51.506
and I would love for your father
and you to be my personal guests.

36:51.668 --> 36:54.717
- Right.
- If you're free.

36:54.879 --> 36:58.759
Our schedules seem to be open.

37:00.844 --> 37:02.721
Have a good night.

37:04.931 --> 37:06.683
What the hell are you doing here?

37:06.850 --> 37:08.410
I waited for you at Truth
like you said.

37:08.573 --> 37:10.573
Yeah, well, good thing
you didn't wait here, right?

37:10.598 --> 37:14.361
Could've been your ass carried away
in those handcuffs, with your record.

37:14.524 --> 37:17.949
As I promised. Take it.

37:19.320 --> 37:23.666
Kantos, you and I aren't gonna have
any problems going forward, are we?

37:24.784 --> 37:28.209
No, we won't.

37:43.678 --> 37:46.397
Ruiz, welcome.

37:46.556 --> 37:48.183
You were at the club.

37:48.349 --> 37:50.898
Why didn't you step forward
and say that you were the connect?

37:51.060 --> 37:53.734
I only make myself known
to a select few.

37:53.897 --> 37:55.615
Cuts down on witnesses.

37:56.900 --> 37:59.198
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
You better back the fuck up.

37:59.360 --> 38:01.863
Your men already
frisked us at the door.

38:02.030 --> 38:03.031
You feel me?

38:03.198 --> 38:05.326
Milan, I've known Vibora
a long time.

38:05.492 --> 38:06.972
If I can trust him,
you can trust him.

38:06.997 --> 38:10.964
Hands up, please.

38:11.122 --> 38:12.544
All right. Tommy's right.

38:12.707 --> 38:15.927
If you trust him, you frisk him.

38:20.256 --> 38:21.428
Okay.

38:21.591 --> 38:23.184
Excuse me. Pardon me.

38:23.343 --> 38:24.560
Sorry.

38:39.317 --> 38:41.365
Is there a problem?

38:53.456 --> 38:55.550
A gift for the host.

38:55.708 --> 38:59.133
A token of appreciation for taking
the meeting on such short notice.

39:02.757 --> 39:04.350
I've already heard this speech.

39:04.509 --> 39:07.388
So if it's the same to everybody,
I'm gonna wait in the hallway.

39:23.903 --> 39:27.999
So, gentlemen,
let's talk business.

39:29.742 --> 39:31.382
At the sound of the beep,
leave a message.

39:31.411 --> 39:33.880
Damn, 'Keisha. Where you at?

39:34.038 --> 39:36.166
Call me back, okay?

39:37.542 --> 39:39.089
Please.

39:48.970 --> 39:50.643
Hey.

39:50.805 --> 39:53.228
I didn't think you'd still be up.

39:53.391 --> 39:54.563
I couldn't sleep.

39:54.726 --> 39:55.943
I see.

39:56.102 --> 39:57.445
I'd offer you one, but...

39:57.604 --> 40:00.904
No need,
but I am gonna celebrate, Tash.

40:01.065 --> 40:03.318
I beat those little motherfuckers,

40:03.484 --> 40:06.408
and I got my club on the brink
of everything I ever wanted.

40:07.530 --> 40:08.782
This is it.

40:11.618 --> 40:13.291
Well, I'm happy for you.

40:13.453 --> 40:15.547
For us, T.

40:15.705 --> 40:19.175
This deal means that the Truth brand
will expand beyond my wildest dreams,

40:19.334 --> 40:21.177
but, more importantly,

40:21.336 --> 40:23.213
our children will have
legit money behind them

40:23.379 --> 40:25.802
for the rest of their lives.

40:29.260 --> 40:31.888
I got to say,

40:32.055 --> 40:35.605
you said you would make it
on the club side, and...

40:35.767 --> 40:37.769
you pulled it off.

40:40.480 --> 40:42.153
I was wrong.

40:49.030 --> 40:50.623
You did a great job today.

40:50.782 --> 40:52.955
Yeah.
The kids seemed to enjoy it,

40:53.117 --> 40:56.747
but I don't know
if the Bougie Bitches Club noticed.

40:56.913 --> 40:59.166
I noticed.

41:05.630 --> 41:08.679
That stuff you said today
about us?

41:10.927 --> 41:12.929
About me and the kids...

41:14.722 --> 41:16.349
you mean it?

41:16.516 --> 41:18.644
Every single word.

41:24.649 --> 41:28.028
I'm glad you found a way
to get Milan his money.

41:28.194 --> 41:30.697
Thank you.

41:30.863 --> 41:32.581
Thank you for protecting us
from him.

41:32.740 --> 41:35.084
Look at me, Tasha.

41:37.745 --> 41:40.043
No matter what,

41:40.206 --> 41:42.880
I'll always protect you and the kids.
You are my family.

41:46.337 --> 41:48.806
I guess you got it all figured out,
don't you?

41:52.093 --> 41:53.891
You can say that.

41:59.726 --> 42:02.525
It's late. I... Raina's got
a dentist appointment tomorrow.

43:41.994 --> 43:43.496
Who'd you want that to be?

43:48.209 --> 43:51.509
I've known you
a long time, Ghost.

43:51.671 --> 43:54.470
Can't nothing be wrong
on your big night, right?

43:54.632 --> 43:57.932
Once I get this call,
the night's about to get bigger.

43:59.595 --> 44:03.816
Because Ruiz is gonna help me
take down Milan.

44:05.726 --> 44:07.148
Wait, what?

44:07.311 --> 44:08.938
What are... what are you talking about?

44:09.105 --> 44:12.780
I got a plan in motion to get us out
from under Milan once and for all.

44:15.361 --> 44:17.534
Ruiz?

44:17.697 --> 44:20.325
I mean, you think
you can trust him?

44:20.491 --> 44:22.744
Tash...

44:22.910 --> 44:26.414
I got way too much on him,
it makes it hard for him not to play ball.

44:26.581 --> 44:29.084
I don't know about this plan, Ghost.

44:29.250 --> 44:30.752
Maybe you should be careful when...

44:30.918 --> 44:32.795
The plan's already in motion
as we speak.

44:32.962 --> 44:34.464
Just waiting on the call.

44:37.383 --> 44:41.138
I mean, while I'm waiting, you know,
probably got time for round two.

44:41.304 --> 44:43.272
I don't know.

44:43.431 --> 44:46.059
L-I need to think before we...

44:48.561 --> 44:52.282
I think maybe you should
go back to the office.

44:52.440 --> 44:54.784
Wait, you... you serious?
Tasha, we just...

44:54.942 --> 44:57.902
I mean, what are the kids gonna think
when they come in here in the morning

44:57.927 --> 44:59.451
and see you sleeping in my bed?

44:59.614 --> 45:02.993
It ain't us getting back together, is it?

45:09.665 --> 45:11.258
You're probably right.

45:12.752 --> 45:14.504
I'll go.

45:25.806 --> 45:28.434
Good night, T.

45:28.601 --> 45:30.569
Good night, Ghost.

45:44.408 --> 45:45.876
Yo, T, what's good?

45:46.035 --> 45:48.584
Ghost just told me
he's gonna take out Milan.

45:48.746 --> 45:50.026
He didn't tell me the specifics,

45:50.051 --> 45:52.713
but he told me he's using Ruiz
to do it right now.

45:52.875 --> 45:54.843
Milan said that
if Ghost doesn't fall in line,

45:55.002 --> 45:56.675
he's gonna kill me and the kids.

45:56.837 --> 45:58.717
You need to find out
what's going on with Ghost,

45:58.839 --> 46:01.058
and you need to stop him.

46:08.224 --> 46:11.228
Listen, I got you, T.

46:11.394 --> 46:13.522
I'm gonna take care of it.

46:14.522 --> 46:17.196
Thanks for calling.
Get yourself some sleep.

46:18.818 --> 46:22.618
- It's all gonna be fine now.
- Okay. Bye.

46:34.625 --> 46:37.128
The alert you wanted me to set up,
we got something.

46:37.295 --> 46:38.638
NYPD just sent this over.

46:38.796 --> 46:41.766
One of Lobos's henchmen
was found dead a few days ago,

46:41.924 --> 46:44.302
a Hugo Sanchez.

46:46.178 --> 46:49.182
- No shit?
- Why would he still be here?

46:49.348 --> 46:52.318
If he was working for Lobos,
that job ended when the man was shot.

46:52.476 --> 46:54.556
Sanchez must've still been
communicating with someone

46:54.687 --> 46:57.190
on the inside, probably this leak
everyone's looking for,

46:57.356 --> 47:00.781
but I guess he can't
be a witness now?

47:00.943 --> 47:02.490
No, I guess he can't.

47:02.653 --> 47:04.997
Unless we find out
where he was staying.

47:05.156 --> 47:06.829
Maybe he met
with a person there?

47:06.991 --> 47:08.471
- I'll look into it.
- No, I'll do it.

47:08.617 --> 47:09.914
You go home.

47:10.077 --> 47:12.671
- You sure?
- Yeah, for sure.

47:12.830 --> 47:14.958
- Great work.
- All right. Thanks.

47:30.473 --> 47:32.441
Boom! Knocks me out.

47:34.977 --> 47:36.479
My kids were crying.
Everybody...

47:36.645 --> 47:39.819
This is good.
So we're all one big happy family now?

47:39.982 --> 47:42.110
Well, Milan heard my concerns

47:42.276 --> 47:44.779
and helped me to understand
my importance here.

47:44.945 --> 47:46.162
So we're good.

47:46.322 --> 47:49.322
We're going to have a drink, Tommy,
to celebrate our continued relationship.

47:49.488 --> 47:50.489
You will be joining us.

47:50.656 --> 47:53.083
I got to call it a night.
I got a meet across town.

47:54.872 --> 47:57.045
I told Poncho to take off.

47:57.208 --> 47:58.710
I said I'd give you a ride home...

47:58.876 --> 48:00.396
- All right.
- But we got to break now.

48:00.421 --> 48:02.547
Well, guess that's
good night for me, too, then.

48:02.713 --> 48:04.340
Gentlemen, a pleasure. Sir.

48:16.519 --> 48:19.113
- It's a beautiful car.
- Thank you.

48:19.271 --> 48:21.899
My father used to own one
just like it.

48:22.066 --> 48:23.613
Well, for a little while.

48:23.776 --> 48:25.619
Hey, Ruiz,

48:25.778 --> 48:27.701
you know what it's like
to be betrayed.

48:27.863 --> 48:31.834
- Yes, I do.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

48:31.992 --> 48:34.120
Somebody you trust constantly
looking you in the eye

48:34.286 --> 48:36.334
but lying to your face?
There's no going back.

48:36.497 --> 48:39.250
That's how he does it.

48:39.417 --> 48:41.977
One side of his mouth telling you
what he thinks you want to hear

48:42.002 --> 48:44.510
and the other side giving you
just enough to make you think

48:44.672 --> 48:47.266
he actually gives a fuck about you
and what you think.

48:48.801 --> 48:50.724
But he don't care
about what happens to you.

48:50.886 --> 48:52.809
He just uses you
until he don't need you no more.

48:52.972 --> 48:54.690
That's what doing Lobos was about.

48:54.849 --> 48:59.355
Tommy, it's been a long night.
What do you say we leave it alone?

49:00.771 --> 49:03.741
Me and Ghost killed him
to start over,

49:03.899 --> 49:05.651
but it was never about that,

49:05.818 --> 49:08.178
just like going from corner boys
to running the biggest shop

49:08.203 --> 49:10.740
in New York fucking City
wasn't about being gangsters.

49:10.906 --> 49:13.500
It was all for him,

49:13.659 --> 49:15.957
all so he could figure
another way to get out.

49:16.120 --> 49:20.466
What's wrong?

49:20.624 --> 49:23.844
It's just...
the old bitch, she's overheating.

49:24.003 --> 49:26.552
Better pull over, check it out.

49:26.714 --> 49:28.261
Older cars, you know how it is.

49:42.271 --> 49:43.864
Sit tight. I'll be a second.

50:01.457 --> 50:05.303
Hey, Ruiz, you get me
my flashlight in the glove box?

50:31.195 --> 50:32.742
I used to work on my dad's car.

50:32.905 --> 50:34.625
If it's overheating,
you're gonna have to...

50:36.534 --> 50:39.208
Tommy, what are you doing?
You're gonna regret this.

50:39.370 --> 50:41.418
No, I won't,
'cause it ain't me doing this to you.

50:41.580 --> 50:43.924
It's Ghost.

51:23.330 --> 51:25.958
No problems?
I been stealing cars since I was 11, man.

51:26.125 --> 51:28.253
- Yeah.
- Oh, shit.

51:28.419 --> 51:30.922
Come on.
Help me drag him to the car.

51:31.088 --> 51:32.260
All right.

51:37.511 --> 51:39.263
No, hold up.

51:43.809 --> 51:45.186
Ghost don't know
about this, right?

51:45.352 --> 51:46.444
No.

51:46.604 --> 51:49.403
He won't know you're involved,
unless you say shit.

51:49.565 --> 51:52.318
I ain't saying a goddamn thing, man.

52:34.943 --> 52:39.164
Betel, 179 West 8th Ave.

53:06.141 --> 53:09.941
181 West 8th Ave.
Where have I seen...

53:12.398 --> 53:14.241
Son of a bitch.

53:25.828 --> 53:27.045
Holy shit.

53:31.375 --> 53:33.377
Mike, what the fuck?

53:40.509 --> 53:42.102
Tommy?

53:43.387 --> 53:46.311
What are you doing here, man?

53:46.473 --> 53:48.350
Have a seat, Ghost.

53:55.899 --> 53:58.197
I know you had a plan with Ruiz.

54:00.446 --> 54:02.995
Ruiz told me about it...

54:03.157 --> 54:05.205
right before I stabbed him.

54:09.288 --> 54:12.167
Ruiz is... he's dead?

54:18.964 --> 54:21.262
- Tommy, where's the body?
- Where's the body?

54:21.425 --> 54:23.769
It's under the fuckin' LIE,
where I left it.

54:23.927 --> 54:25.850
Who gives a fuck about the body?

54:26.013 --> 54:30.234
I told you, one more time,
and Milan was gonna kill me,

54:30.392 --> 54:35.398
and you looked me in the face,
and you said you weren't.

54:35.564 --> 54:38.943
What makes you think Milan
isn't gonna kill us tomorrow

54:39.109 --> 54:41.282
or the next day or the next
fucking day after that?

54:41.445 --> 54:44.790
You fucking lied to me, Ghost.

54:46.992 --> 54:49.245
To me.

54:52.331 --> 54:54.691
I didn't want you in the dark.
I wanted to do this with you,

54:54.833 --> 54:56.756
take Milan's fucking ass down.
Why?

54:56.919 --> 54:59.388
Because Milan out of the way
benefits both of us, man,

54:59.546 --> 55:01.186
but I didn't think I'd get you to see it.

55:01.211 --> 55:04.351
So, yes, I lied, all right?
But if you want me to say I'm sorry?

55:04.510 --> 55:07.810
To fucking sit here and say I'm sorry,
it's not gonna happen, Tommy.

55:07.971 --> 55:10.724
I want out, man,

55:10.891 --> 55:13.565
and I'm never gonna stop...

55:13.727 --> 55:16.355
Never... until I get out.

55:16.522 --> 55:20.447
So unless you put me down,
right here, right now,

55:20.609 --> 55:24.489
it is what it is, man.

55:26.156 --> 55:29.126
You said getting Milan out the way
benefits both of us.

55:29.284 --> 55:32.914
- That right?
- Yeah, I said that.

55:33.080 --> 55:35.799
- Help me see that.
- Okay.

55:37.668 --> 55:40.217
You want to run the drug business
the way you want to run it,

55:40.379 --> 55:44.350
and I want to run my life
the way I want to run it.

55:44.508 --> 55:47.227
As long as Milan's in charge,
Tommy, it ain't gonna happen,

55:47.386 --> 55:48.933
man, for either one of us.

55:49.096 --> 55:50.496
But I'm getting in
so good with him.

55:50.639 --> 55:54.109
Tommy, he's a fucking psychopath,
man, and every day you...

55:54.268 --> 55:58.819
You allow him to dig his claws in,
it's one more day he gets closer

55:58.981 --> 56:00.301
to the organization becoming his.

56:00.440 --> 56:02.238
So I say we
fucking get rid of him, man.

56:02.401 --> 56:04.995
And you can mark
your own path, brother.

56:05.153 --> 56:08.657
L just need some time to come up
with a plan to take Milan down.

56:08.824 --> 56:11.247
I just need some time.

56:11.410 --> 56:12.627
No.

56:17.332 --> 56:18.925
Tommy...

56:28.552 --> 56:30.554
Ghost...

56:34.308 --> 56:36.527
if we're gonna do this,

56:36.685 --> 56:38.278
kill Milan,

56:38.437 --> 56:40.860
I call the shots.

56:41.023 --> 56:42.616
I'll come up with a plan.

56:45.277 --> 56:46.745
Call you in the morning.

57:02.586 --> 57:04.839
Tommy, I didn't expect
to see you back tonight.

57:05.005 --> 57:06.006
What's going on?

57:06.173 --> 57:10.349
A few days ago,
you asked me if I was one of you.

57:10.510 --> 57:12.763
I did.

57:14.681 --> 57:16.979
Yeah, you did.

57:17.142 --> 57:18.985
Well, I am,

57:19.144 --> 57:21.442
