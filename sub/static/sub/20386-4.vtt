WEBVTT

00:10.060 --> 00:13.230
Darling, I know. It's beastly.

00:13.280 --> 00:15.430
Everything's excruciating!

00:15.480 --> 00:20.550
Well, at least you're at home
now so I can look after you.

00:20.600 --> 00:24.190
If my testicles start swelling, you
know what that means, don't you?!

00:24.240 --> 00:27.430
- Yes, I do.
- Agony and infertility!

00:27.480 --> 00:33.230
That's really quite rare. Everyone
gets mumps. Look how fun it sounds!

00:33.280 --> 00:35.520
Mumps! It's like a clown's name. Ha-ha!

00:36.520 --> 00:40.430
Aaaagh. I blame Vasilia. She infected me.

00:40.480 --> 00:44.280
More fool you for becoming her
boyfriend. She's dangerous, Larry.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.110
You look so weird.

00:48.160 --> 00:51.390
- Leslie, please!
- He's got a face like a fat person!

00:51.440 --> 00:53.630
Leave! So I can recheck my scrotum.

00:53.680 --> 00:55.670
Mother, stop him talking like that.

00:55.720 --> 00:57.790
Theo told me that a bushcricket's testes

00:57.840 --> 00:59.790
make upper 14% of its body weight.

00:59.840 --> 01:03.230
- Well, that could be me tomorrow.
- Stop talking about that area!

01:03.280 --> 01:06.110
It's a good excuse to keep Aunt
Hermione away from the house.

01:06.160 --> 01:09.070
Isn't that a bit mean? She's
coming all the way from England.

01:09.120 --> 01:13.710
- Yeah, to wag her finger at us.
- It's not mean, there's nowhere for
her to stay now that Donald's here.

01:13.760 --> 01:15.950
I did notice that. Five
minutes after I move out

01:16.000 --> 01:18.830
and you've get a new son and I'm
relegated to the guest couch.

01:18.880 --> 01:20.990
- I have the mumps now.
- No, you don't.

01:21.040 --> 01:22.870
I will die soon.

01:22.920 --> 01:25.000
- No, you won't.
- Mum!

01:31.400 --> 01:35.070
Look at the sky. Dark.

01:35.120 --> 01:38.030
Terrible.

01:38.080 --> 01:40.150
There will be a death soon.

01:41.960 --> 01:44.790
- No, there will not.
- Bring me a poultice!

01:44.840 --> 01:47.000
Unless I kill Larry.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.074

02:37.280 --> 02:41.150
So, I'll assess Jerry's abilities,
and tailor a timetable to his needs.

02:41.200 --> 02:43.870
Yes, I just want him to be
able to do his times table.

02:43.920 --> 02:45.670
And spell Hastings.

02:45.720 --> 02:48.620
Yes, but it... but it's a little
more complicated than that.

02:49.560 --> 02:51.590
Oh, hello, Margo!

02:51.640 --> 02:54.670
- Hello, Donald.
- Oh, thank you for coming, Theo.

02:54.720 --> 02:57.750
I just felt Larry needed
some intellectual stimulus.

02:57.800 --> 03:00.110
And we needed a break.

03:00.160 --> 03:03.830
Well, he'll be out of the
infectious stage in a day or two,

03:03.880 --> 03:06.310
and he can go back to his apartment.

03:06.360 --> 03:08.750
I had mumps. It's horrible.

03:08.800 --> 03:13.110
Me too. My parotid glands felt
like they were pumped full of glue.

03:13.160 --> 03:16.150
Yes, but at least you've
had it, and all the others.

03:16.200 --> 03:18.670
Hugh hasn't, so he won't be dropping in.

03:18.720 --> 03:21.360
Theo, come back and
talk to me about Proust.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.710
I go home now.

03:31.760 --> 03:33.470
What? Well, why?

03:33.520 --> 03:36.760
The sky is falling. Someone will die.

03:43.320 --> 03:45.320
Pame pame pame! Grigora!

03:47.000 --> 03:48.710
Why do I have to be educated?

03:48.760 --> 03:50.590
It's traditional.

03:50.640 --> 03:52.510
I learn more from a walk in the woods.

03:52.560 --> 03:54.750
Donald won't be strict. He's sweet.

03:54.800 --> 03:58.600
He's just a bit boring. Compared to him.

04:03.920 --> 04:06.350
- It's going to rain.
- How can I get rid of these spots?

04:06.400 --> 04:10.190
- The greater spotted woodpecker.
- That doesn't help, Gerry.

04:10.240 --> 04:13.670
Is it unrequited love or
some bigger spiritual vacuum?

04:13.720 --> 04:16.310
I think it's the little
ducts that get blocked up.

04:16.360 --> 04:18.470
God, I hate being this age.

04:20.279 --> 04:21.190
Oh, gosh.

04:22.240 --> 04:22.960
Quick, Gerry.

04:26.940 --> 04:30.760
Roger, come on! Hurry up, Margo!

04:33.680 --> 04:35.840
Ugh, I hate this!

04:36.960 --> 04:39.190
Hey, hey, wait there.

04:39.240 --> 04:41.110
Margo grab... grab the basket.

04:41.160 --> 04:44.150
People are running around
like it's the end of the world.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.070
It's a bad day to be an insect.

04:46.120 --> 04:49.150
- Let me help you.
- I want to bring Sally in.

04:49.200 --> 04:51.110
No! Gerry! Come in.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.950
I fear I am trapped.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.870
Oh, I'm so sorry, Theo.

05:01.920 --> 05:04.470
Normally I'd gladly
nestle in among Durrells,

05:04.520 --> 05:06.230
but Larry's not at his best.

05:06.280 --> 05:08.230
Ah, you noticed.

05:08.380 --> 05:11.070
Mrs Durrells! Welcome to England!

05:11.120 --> 05:13.070
Ah, Spiro, come in.

05:13.120 --> 05:16.840
I bring you your auntie, looking
even more jolly than last year.

05:17.840 --> 05:19.590
Louisa!

05:19.640 --> 05:24.990
Aunt Hermione! Welcome back
to Corfu. You're a day early.

05:25.040 --> 05:28.310
Yes. Venice was closed, for some reason.

05:28.360 --> 05:30.630
I shall be writing letters of complaint.

05:30.680 --> 05:35.670
This is Mrs Haddock, one
of our British contingent.

05:35.720 --> 05:37.680
She's very special.

05:39.440 --> 05:41.750
Mrs Durrell. I've heard a lot about you.

05:41.800 --> 05:44.550
Well, as they say, all good, I hope!

05:44.600 --> 05:48.510
No, as they say, a fairly mixed bag.

05:48.560 --> 05:50.550
Right.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.160
I assure you that Mrs Durrells is...

05:54.160 --> 05:55.870
What's the opposite of mixed bag?

05:55.920 --> 05:57.880
A bag with all the same things in it.

05:59.000 --> 06:03.870
Anyway, before you take your coats
off, I'm afraid Lawrence has mumps,

06:03.920 --> 06:06.070
and he's still infectious.

06:06.120 --> 06:08.390
- Oh, dear. - Yes! And
this is what he looks like.

06:08.440 --> 06:10.520
Beware all ye who enter this place.

06:12.040 --> 06:13.950
I urge you to stay in a hotel.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.600
No. Greek hotels are... are dismaying.

06:19.840 --> 06:22.840
It's Mr Stephanides, isn't it?

06:27.960 --> 06:31.190
We visited your somewhat outre home.

06:31.240 --> 06:35.710
You did. I no longer have the octopus.

06:35.760 --> 06:39.550
Mrs Haddock and I are delighted
to accept your hospitality.

06:39.600 --> 06:42.550
- Splendid idea!
- Excellent.

06:42.600 --> 06:46.510
Sadly, Theo is very busy with his work.

06:46.560 --> 06:48.560
Why is he here, then?

06:50.200 --> 06:55.230
Exposed as a fraud! Ladies,
it will be a pleasure.

06:55.280 --> 06:57.670
What's everyone talking about?

06:57.720 --> 07:00.280
- Keep him away!
- Of course.

07:01.480 --> 07:03.400
Just hurry up and get better!

07:05.080 --> 07:08.030
Hello. Ooh, nasty spots.

07:08.080 --> 07:11.800
- Yes. - I can cure you.
I've got certain gifts.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.520
She has. She is a medium.

07:16.440 --> 07:18.390
- Really?!
- Yes.

07:18.440 --> 07:21.280
Me too... or sometimes a 'large'.

07:25.880 --> 07:27.790
Shall we?

07:27.840 --> 07:30.630
- Have you always had the gift?
- Oh, yes.

07:30.680 --> 07:34.560
Mrs Durrell, I can feel the
presence of your late husband.

07:35.560 --> 07:37.390
No, you can't.

07:37.440 --> 07:39.670
He loved the rain, didn't he?

07:39.720 --> 07:43.830
Hates being alone, as you know.
Oh, he's suffering terribly,

07:43.880 --> 07:46.400
now you so have many male admirers.

08:05.800 --> 08:07.550
It's rather cosy.

08:07.600 --> 08:09.470
It's like a prison.

08:09.520 --> 08:11.990
Well, the forecast says two
days of torrential rain,

08:12.040 --> 08:16.070
- so let's just enjoy being
together as a family. - Plus Donald.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.150
Half the Nativity.

08:18.200 --> 08:20.230
She was looking sad.

08:20.280 --> 08:22.190
That's what donkeys look like.

08:22.240 --> 08:26.550
And it's a great opportunity for us
to start tutoring in earnest, Gerry.

08:26.600 --> 08:30.070
Poor Theo, having to put up Aunt Hermione

08:30.120 --> 08:32.230
and that... Haddock woman.

08:32.280 --> 08:35.590
I thought she was marvellous.
She's going to cure my spots.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.750
- What spots?
- Those.

08:37.799 --> 08:39.510
The ones on her face.

08:39.559 --> 08:41.830
All that nonsense about being a medium.

08:41.880 --> 08:45.430
So, how did she know Daddy liked
the rain but hated being on his own?

08:45.480 --> 08:47.550
Well, who does like being on their own?

08:47.600 --> 08:50.310
- Me. - Me too. - I rather enjoy it.

08:50.360 --> 08:53.670
I remember Father insisting that
you went with him everywhere.

08:53.720 --> 08:55.840
That's because we were in love.

08:57.920 --> 08:59.640
I still miss him.

09:02.360 --> 09:04.430
'Oh, Death, where is thy sting?'

09:04.480 --> 09:07.200
Ah, source, anybody?

09:08.400 --> 09:12.110
Oscar Wilde, Mark Twain,
bloody... Confucius?

09:12.160 --> 09:14.030
The Bible?

09:14.080 --> 09:16.230
No. Shakespeare.

09:16.280 --> 09:21.390
Well, both, actually. One
Corinthians 55, and Henry VIII.

09:21.440 --> 09:23.160
I've got mumps, you know!

09:25.560 --> 09:27.880
What if I never really get over his death?

09:29.520 --> 09:34.070
Don't roll your eyes at me.
I take marriage seriously,

09:34.120 --> 09:37.470
I don't just casually announce I'm
getting married to a psychopath.

09:37.520 --> 09:43.790
Vasilia is not a psychopath... on
the whole. Marriage is paperwork.

09:43.840 --> 09:48.990
It was the defining decision
and the glory of my life.

09:49.040 --> 09:51.230
Try looking forward.

09:51.280 --> 09:54.990
You shilly-shally about Hugh, he's alive,

09:55.040 --> 09:58.350
- Father isn't.
- Shut up, Larry. Respect the dead.

09:58.400 --> 10:01.430
Stop it! Mrs Haddock is a spiritualist,

10:01.480 --> 10:03.430
she can put us in touch with Daddy.

10:03.480 --> 10:06.590
- Don't be ridiculous.
- More to the point, stuck here together,

10:06.640 --> 10:10.160
how long before we start wanting
to kill each other and join him?

10:29.200 --> 10:30.910
No, no chickens!

10:30.960 --> 10:33.480
They were petrified.
And we can use the eggs.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.070
Ah! Get off!

10:36.920 --> 10:39.150
The rain's pouring into my bedroom.

10:39.200 --> 10:41.030
- Bucket.
- They've all been used.

10:41.080 --> 10:45.030
I think it's happening. Do
my testicles look bigger?

10:45.080 --> 10:46.830
- Ugh!
- No! No, Larry, no!

10:46.880 --> 10:48.750
Don't show me things I don't want to see!

10:48.800 --> 10:50.510
You're always showing me your guns.

10:50.560 --> 10:53.510
"Oh, look at the barrel, it's
machine-tooled, you know."

10:53.560 --> 10:56.790
Oh, er... er... the... the
chicken's done a... a... You know.

10:56.840 --> 10:58.640
I'll clear it up!

11:01.600 --> 11:03.830
Larry made Leslie see his men's area.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.830
Don't be so repressed. It's a body.

11:05.880 --> 11:07.990
You're happy enough to
look at tulip bulbs.

11:08.040 --> 11:11.270
Yes, and I'll feel the same way when
you bury your balls in the garden.

11:11.320 --> 11:13.470
- Look, please.
- No, I hate being shut up inside!

11:13.520 --> 11:15.670
- I am an outdoor person.
- Well, we can't go out.

11:15.720 --> 11:18.510
So organise some activities.
And make sure they're fun.

11:18.560 --> 11:21.990
Ah, Gerry... er... will you sit down,
please, so you can do my evaluation?

11:22.040 --> 11:24.110
- I can't!
- Just sit down and do it!

11:24.160 --> 11:27.550
All right, everyone come
up with an entertainment.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.630
- No. - Busy. - I'm
dying. - Yes, you will!

11:29.680 --> 11:32.310
Ooh, I've written some love
poetry I'd be happy to share.

11:32.360 --> 11:34.230
- No! No!
- Get me out in the rain!

11:34.280 --> 11:38.270
Look, I'm sure they're not very
good. But they are very sincere.

11:38.320 --> 11:40.470
You said it's too foul to go out.

11:40.520 --> 11:43.510
I can't leave Theo to suffer with
Aunt Hermione and Mrs Haddock.

11:43.560 --> 11:46.630
You're going to ask her how she
knew about Daddy, aren't you?

11:46.680 --> 11:48.400
Of course not.

12:33.640 --> 12:36.000
Can I explain any of my experiments?

12:37.120 --> 12:38.870
No.

12:38.920 --> 12:43.510
I don't approve of science.
It reduces everything.

12:43.560 --> 12:47.270
Or, does it improve
lives and shine a light

12:47.320 --> 12:49.040
on the glorious world around us?

12:52.680 --> 12:54.840
- Come in. Come in.
- Oh, gosh!

12:56.680 --> 12:58.440
I've never known anything like it.

12:59.800 --> 13:01.520
Thank you, Theo.

13:02.520 --> 13:04.350
So, did everyone sleep well?

13:04.400 --> 13:06.200
One did one's best.

13:07.200 --> 13:09.790
Well, at least it's dry here.

13:09.840 --> 13:12.640
Our house is leaking like a colander.

13:15.840 --> 13:18.160
Urgghhh.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.990
Have you seen Gerry?

13:25.040 --> 13:27.000
No.

13:30.680 --> 13:32.440
Urggghh.

13:42.240 --> 13:46.800
I can't believe you told Mother
she's an idiot to miss Father.

13:47.800 --> 13:50.550
Mmm.

13:50.600 --> 13:53.470
His name is Hugh and he grows olives.

13:53.520 --> 13:56.430
- Yes.
- And are you serious about him?

13:56.480 --> 13:58.790
So soon after your
liaison with your Swede?

13:58.840 --> 14:01.190
You are determined to
make me sound flighty.

14:01.240 --> 14:04.150
It's been nine years
since my husband died,

14:04.200 --> 14:08.120
and there's been Sven and
then, very tentatively, Hugh.

14:10.800 --> 14:12.720
- No, we are just friends.
- Auntie!

14:13.960 --> 14:16.030
You'll never shake off
your husband, my dear.

14:16.080 --> 14:19.990
There's a reason he called you "my angel".

14:20.040 --> 14:22.400
He's also YOUR angel.

14:24.880 --> 14:26.710
How do you know these things about him?

14:26.760 --> 14:29.550
- Have you been telling her, Aunt?
- Not a word.

14:29.600 --> 14:33.030
I have a strong sense of
people. The way, I gather,

14:33.080 --> 14:35.840
your son understands animals.

14:37.160 --> 14:40.670
I'll hold a seance so you can
speak to your husband again.

14:40.720 --> 14:42.910
No, no, I don't want that.

14:42.960 --> 14:46.390
Oh, but you should, Louisa. Mrs
Haddock is little short of a genius.

14:46.440 --> 14:48.110
Oh, I'm not.

14:48.160 --> 14:52.310
I'm all for God, but contacting the
dead is a superstition too far.

14:52.360 --> 14:54.840
Oh, I... I... I don't
like the term "dead".

14:56.680 --> 14:59.030
You're usually so sceptical, Aunt.

14:59.080 --> 15:03.160
- Well, as I get older and
closer to my... - Departure.

15:04.680 --> 15:08.080
Departure... I become more open-minded.

15:09.360 --> 15:13.150
I'll also cure Margo's
spots, using my faith healing.

15:13.200 --> 15:15.870
I'm afraid I must resume my work.

15:15.920 --> 15:19.030
I'm giving a paper about
Cephalopods and their inky sacs.

15:19.080 --> 15:21.070
Oh, yes, of course, sorry, Theo.

15:21.120 --> 15:24.190
If I may, I'll fetch Spiro to
drive the ladies somewhere else.

15:24.240 --> 15:27.720
- I should do that.
- No, no, honestly I'd be delighted.

15:40.640 --> 15:43.950
Theo told me that Larry's
no longer infectious.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.470
Well, I feel guilty about my poor welcome.

15:46.520 --> 15:50.270
So, ladies, it will be damp
and a bit of a squeeze,

15:50.320 --> 15:54.240
but please, do come home with me.

15:56.160 --> 15:59.830
1932, and fashion was seeing
a return to the corset

15:59.880 --> 16:02.310
but was far removed
from old-style bodices.

16:02.360 --> 16:04.230
Shall we jump ahead to this year?

16:04.280 --> 16:08.270
- Look, we might not understand
it, or even enjoy it. - What?

16:08.320 --> 16:11.400
- But you mustn't interrupt
the entertainment. - Shhh.

16:12.600 --> 16:15.030
Fascinating things were
about to happen to hats.

16:15.080 --> 16:18.070
- Oh, no, not hats.
- Right, that's it, I'm stopping.

16:18.120 --> 16:21.990
Right, Donald, you're on. Now, I
know you said you had some poems,

16:22.040 --> 16:26.030
but something else might be
more fun. D'you know any magic?

16:26.080 --> 16:28.790
No I'd... I'd really like to do my poetry.

16:28.840 --> 16:31.480
- OK.
- Go on.

16:36.740 --> 16:39.040
- Ooh.
- Dropped your pencil.

16:42.800 --> 16:47.150
You, me, I, you,

16:47.200 --> 16:49.880
Together we are us.

16:51.200 --> 16:55.310
Heart, soul, guts -- one.

16:55.360 --> 16:57.550
Our love is offal...

17:01.000 --> 17:02.240
Sorry.

17:03.640 --> 17:05.560
It's very good... very good.

17:08.280 --> 17:09.750
.. Charis made you.

17:09.800 --> 17:12.109
Euthymia buffed you.

17:12.160 --> 17:14.349
Till you now gleam

17:14.400 --> 17:16.510
- in your Greek jewel box.
- That's brilliant.

17:16.560 --> 17:18.560
- Shall we take a break, then?
- No -- there's more.

17:19.359 --> 17:21.230
- Sacred bosom...
- Hello!

17:21.280 --> 17:23.310
I've got Aunt Hermione with me.

17:23.359 --> 17:25.270
- I'll help!
- Me too!

17:25.319 --> 17:28.750
Send Lawrence to a far corner of the
house! I fear lingering contagion.

17:28.800 --> 17:30.600
Aarghh.

17:32.680 --> 17:35.230
Give me a chance! I'm going, I'm going.

17:35.280 --> 17:39.040
Why are there animals in the house?

17:40.640 --> 17:44.320
They're Gerry's. He thought they
looked depressed out in the rain.

17:46.040 --> 17:48.960
Thank you, Spiro, as ever.

17:49.960 --> 17:54.030
Don't let your strange guest make you sad.

17:54.080 --> 17:56.160
- And the sun will return.
- I know.

18:31.400 --> 18:33.280
Gerry, shovel!

18:35.480 --> 18:39.030
I've no doubt I have 20 good years left,

18:39.080 --> 18:41.430
but I tend to look back now

18:41.480 --> 18:43.190
rather than forward.

18:43.240 --> 18:46.190
Yes, me too, oddly, at the moment.

18:46.240 --> 18:48.230
Your husband?

18:48.280 --> 18:51.270
Yes. Every time I feel I'm moving on,

18:51.320 --> 18:55.720
he reappears like a ghost at the feast.

18:57.240 --> 19:02.110
I know you mistrust Mrs
Haddock, but I'm no fool,

19:02.160 --> 19:07.920
and she seems to have a door
into the lost world of the past.

19:11.080 --> 19:12.800
Oooh.

19:20.040 --> 19:22.110
Do you have cabbage?

19:22.160 --> 19:24.270
Oh, yes, we do.

19:24.320 --> 19:26.680
- Put it on your face.
- Hm?

19:28.240 --> 19:33.710
Put cabbage on your face and your
spots will disappear within hours.

19:33.760 --> 19:35.710
Oh, how lovely.

19:35.760 --> 19:38.870
Thank you. Cooked?

19:38.920 --> 19:43.830
No. But the root cause is
deeper and more spiritual.

19:43.880 --> 19:47.430
I know!

19:47.480 --> 19:52.390
I'd love us to have a seance.
I'll try to persuade Mother.

19:52.440 --> 19:54.240
Oh, please do.

19:56.560 --> 19:57.990
(Oh, goats.)

19:58.040 --> 20:00.940
It's becoming clear that you're
avoiding doing this test...

20:01.460 --> 20:03.110
Do you have to sit on the donkey?

20:03.160 --> 20:04.990
No, but there's no space or chairs.

20:05.040 --> 20:07.470
I can't do it myself, it falls off.

20:07.520 --> 20:09.550
No, I'm not attaching
cabbage to your face.

20:09.600 --> 20:11.590
It's insane, and you are so gullible.

20:11.640 --> 20:15.190
I'd be more than happy to attach
cabbage or anything to your face.

20:15.240 --> 20:17.830
- Yes, like YOUR face.
- Leslie!

20:17.880 --> 20:19.760
Outrageous!

20:21.280 --> 20:23.240
Here, let me help you.

20:27.920 --> 20:29.710
How do you normally do this?

20:29.760 --> 20:32.470
I don't normally do this.

20:32.520 --> 20:35.880
Of course not. Idiot. Erm...

20:50.200 --> 20:52.120
Aargghhhh!

21:00.680 --> 21:03.910
Conservation will become more and
more important as we interfere

21:03.960 --> 21:07.790
with nature. Me and my friend
Theo have caught two otters

21:07.840 --> 21:11.190
and are trying to breed them,
because there are hardly any left.

21:11.240 --> 21:14.910
This photo is copyright of Leslie.
He's a very good photographer.

21:14.960 --> 21:16.560
Yep.

21:18.800 --> 21:20.870
Well, I... I wanted to be a photographer.

21:20.920 --> 21:26.000
But... er... nobody in Corfu has money
to pay me so... I've done a painting.

21:28.360 --> 21:31.160
- That's wonderful, darling.
- That's brilliant, Les.

21:32.080 --> 21:34.430
Ah, good. Not bad, is it?

21:34.480 --> 21:38.070
"The mossy, bosky croft squatted

21:38.120 --> 21:41.750
like a deposed monarch on the open plain.

21:41.800 --> 21:47.950
The cloy of death oozed out, parting
miasma of the dead shepherd inside.

21:48.000 --> 21:53.720
A maggoty crofter in a tartan shroud."

22:13.280 --> 22:16.040
'I can feel the presence
of your late husband.

22:17.520 --> 22:19.510
He loved the rain, didn't he?'

22:23.720 --> 22:26.310
'He reappears like a ghost at the feast.'

22:59.040 --> 23:00.920
Whoa, God!

23:04.680 --> 23:06.590
Someone's mucked around with this.

23:06.640 --> 23:09.950
Oh, darling. Maybe the rain dripped on it.

23:10.000 --> 23:13.150
I can't stand being stuck in here.
Honestly, I want to hurt Larry,

23:13.200 --> 23:16.320
I'm missing Lugaretzia. I
wish I'd just gone with her.

23:18.120 --> 23:21.110
Mother, look! It looks like
someone's trying to erase us.

23:21.160 --> 23:23.030
Ooh, oh. Will you stop it, please!

23:23.080 --> 23:26.640
I hope this works. I ran out of cabbage.

23:27.800 --> 23:30.190
And take that stupid
vegetable off your face.

23:30.240 --> 23:32.110
Ow. Don't, it's medicinal!

23:32.160 --> 23:33.960
Right!

23:40.720 --> 23:45.070
Since you blew into our lives,
we've been besieged by morbidity

23:45.120 --> 23:48.990
and gloom. Larry's turned his
illness into a death sentence.

23:49.040 --> 23:50.950
Death is an illusion.

23:51.000 --> 23:56.520
Oh, if only. I dreamt of my husband
last night, something I never do.

23:57.760 --> 23:59.950
How dare you suggest that he is suffering

24:00.000 --> 24:02.230
because I have an
innocent gentleman friend.

24:02.280 --> 24:04.640
But you are thinking it yourself.

24:15.480 --> 24:17.430
How do you know so much about him?

24:17.480 --> 24:21.430
It's the gift, dear.

24:21.480 --> 24:23.480
Breathe this in.

24:42.480 --> 24:45.030
It's him.

24:45.080 --> 24:49.720
It's his hair, his cologne.

24:59.120 --> 25:00.910
How did you do this?

25:00.960 --> 25:03.720
They're closer than we think.

25:12.120 --> 25:17.160
Very well. Please stage a seance.

25:24.040 --> 25:28.350
- I'm looking forward to introducing
you to my guide. - What's that?

25:28.400 --> 25:33.310
He's a spirit guide. My best
is a Red Indian called Mawake.

25:33.360 --> 25:35.830
There may be ectoplasm.

25:35.880 --> 25:38.030
Ah. Good. What's that?

25:38.080 --> 25:41.550
It's a spiritual energy that
materialises into the air.

25:41.600 --> 25:43.320
Ooh.

25:44.320 --> 25:46.990
What does it look like so I
can keep my eyes open for it?

25:47.040 --> 25:51.750
Well, it has different forms.
It's often gelatinous like brains.

25:51.800 --> 25:56.390
Erm... before I go to my
room to prepare myself,

25:56.440 --> 26:00.520
I've got something serious to ask you.

26:02.480 --> 26:04.830
That's it, I'm not hiding away any more.

26:04.880 --> 26:07.310
If anyone doesn't wanna
risk catching the mumps,

26:07.360 --> 26:09.150
leave the house now!

26:09.200 --> 26:12.720
I'm trying to organise Gerry's education.

26:14.400 --> 26:17.470
- Well, go on, then.
- Gerald! Animal stools!

26:17.520 --> 26:19.270
- Coming!
- No!

26:19.320 --> 26:23.110
Which is more important --
animal excrement or education?

26:23.160 --> 26:25.030
- Is that one of the questions?
- No.

26:25.080 --> 26:28.270
I hate being shut in! I'm
going out in the rain.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.270
Don't be stupid. To do what?

26:30.320 --> 26:33.430
I'm very much not interested
in what you have to say!

26:33.480 --> 26:37.040
I heard lightning killed two
people last year in Corfu.

26:40.080 --> 26:43.440
Erm... Mrs Haddock is holding
a seance soon, apparently.

26:44.720 --> 26:46.800
- Your mother agreed.
- Ohhh.

26:48.680 --> 26:50.560
No!

26:53.040 --> 26:55.430
Even if by some lunatic
billion-to-one chance

26:55.480 --> 26:58.390
Father does appear as a ghost,
that's not gonna end well, is it?

26:58.440 --> 27:00.230
How can I know?

27:00.280 --> 27:02.270
It didn't make Hamlet sleep any easier.

27:02.320 --> 27:05.550
Look, you don't know what it's
like to miss someone so much

27:05.600 --> 27:08.630
that it sucks the life out of
you, even after several years.

27:08.680 --> 27:12.150
The point is, the scar had
healed. And Hugh wants you.

27:12.200 --> 27:16.310
And yet he hasn't braved the deluge
and the slight chance of mumps

27:16.360 --> 27:18.270
to come and see me.

27:18.320 --> 27:20.950
Well, I am getting better.

27:26.160 --> 27:32.270
Look, I need to know if
Mrs Haddock is a fraud.

27:32.320 --> 27:35.320
She seems remarkable.

27:37.120 --> 27:40.430
Erm... Leslie's redone his painting.

27:41.480 --> 27:43.870
He really doesn't like being
stuck indoors, does he?

27:43.920 --> 27:46.910
♪ Oh when the Saints go marching in

27:46.960 --> 27:49.110

I don't think he'll be out there too long.

28:01.760 --> 28:05.390

28:05.440 --> 28:07.280
Ooof!

28:28.120 --> 28:30.120
Ooh.

28:33.040 --> 28:35.030
All right.

28:35.080 --> 28:38.870

as you think it's going to be. - No.

28:40.620 --> 28:41.160
Oh!

28:49.720 --> 28:53.550
Two days with my family. I must escape.

28:53.600 --> 28:57.510
Please, enter. We're about to begin.

28:57.560 --> 28:59.670
Come, come, come.

28:59.720 --> 29:03.070
Po po, o Theos filaxe!

29:03.120 --> 29:04.990
I've got an awful feeling about this.

29:14.720 --> 29:16.430
We were concerned.

29:16.480 --> 29:19.550
In case your mother had been lured
into a spiritualist gathering.

29:19.600 --> 29:22.040
- These people can be dangerous.
- Just in time.

29:34.160 --> 29:36.670
You, of all people, looking nervous?

29:36.720 --> 29:38.640
Nervous? No.

29:53.360 --> 29:56.960
Lay your hands on the table.

29:58.880 --> 30:01.480
Hold the person's next to you.

30:06.200 --> 30:09.230
It's a comfort to know that
those who have gone before

30:09.280 --> 30:11.400
are still within our reach.

30:12.480 --> 30:18.360
Now, please shut your eyes
and I will go into a trance.

30:42.520 --> 30:45.910
Oh, sorry, it's Gerry. I
locked him in a room to work.

30:45.960 --> 30:48.390
Donald, are you serious?

30:48.440 --> 30:51.160
Absolutely ridiculous.

30:55.520 --> 30:57.430
Why does it have to be so dark?

30:57.480 --> 30:59.880
Gerry! Come sit here by my side.

31:12.880 --> 31:14.830
Ow!

31:16.720 --> 31:19.190
- Don't like it.
- Has she fallen asleep?

31:19.240 --> 31:21.390
Be quiet or you'll spoil it.

31:21.440 --> 31:25.190
There are strangers
among us. You're welcome!

31:25.240 --> 31:27.150
We were just passing.

31:27.200 --> 31:29.150
Strictly speaking, YOU are the stranger.

31:29.200 --> 31:32.390
- This is Mawake.
- Oh, he's the best guide. A Red Indian.

31:32.440 --> 31:35.230
Mawake is in contact with Mr Durrell.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.830
He's in!

31:40.880 --> 31:42.880
Close the window.

31:47.800 --> 31:49.710
Ah, what's that against my hand?!

31:49.760 --> 31:51.560
Ectoplasm!

32:03.440 --> 32:08.880
Your husband is reaching
out for you. He's so alone.

32:12.920 --> 32:14.870
Leave it! He's restless.

32:18.680 --> 32:20.880
Feel their presence.

32:37.400 --> 32:40.560
They reach out in the darkness.

32:49.520 --> 32:51.560
I can feel his touch.

32:55.760 --> 32:58.550
What are you doing? Disturb nothing.

32:58.600 --> 33:01.070
- Ah! - What was that? - Fake ectoplasm!

33:01.120 --> 33:03.470
- She had it in her bag!
- I saw it!

33:03.520 --> 33:05.470
This is an outrage!

33:07.680 --> 33:11.310
Close the curtains! Remove the wildlife!

33:11.360 --> 33:13.790
Why did I almost believe you?!

33:13.840 --> 33:16.670
You unbelievers sometimes need help.

33:16.720 --> 33:18.910
Louisa, you're jumping to conclusions.

33:18.960 --> 33:21.230
She is exploiting people's grief.

33:21.280 --> 33:24.880
Why should she? She
receives no remuneration.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.880
- Ah.
- Miss Margo?

33:30.360 --> 33:32.560
Did you pay Mrs Haddock?

33:34.240 --> 33:37.000
She was so convincing.

33:38.240 --> 33:41.030
I gave her everything I'd saved
from working at the market.

33:41.080 --> 33:43.070
Oh, Margo.

33:43.120 --> 33:46.430
Actually, it wasn't that much.
I'm the world's worst saver.

33:46.480 --> 33:48.880
And I gave her some money too.

33:50.840 --> 33:51.750
And me.

33:52.800 --> 33:55.870
She looks you in the eyes and
you just feel yourself paying.

33:55.920 --> 33:58.280
Teach me how you do that, Mrs Haddock.

33:59.280 --> 34:01.800
It seems I was deceived.

34:03.320 --> 34:05.710
In anticipation, I brought a book of mine

34:05.760 --> 34:08.429
about how to expose fake mediums.

34:08.480 --> 34:11.960
If you wait long enough,
every book becomes useful.

34:15.600 --> 34:17.360
Where's she gone?

34:20.920 --> 34:23.480
Son of a bitch!

34:31.540 --> 34:34.810
I'll drive her. After all,
she is a guest on our island.

34:34.860 --> 34:36.850
I'll come too.

34:36.900 --> 34:40.730
In the car I can impress
on Mrs Haddock the power

34:40.780 --> 34:42.739
and beauty of rational thought.

34:44.780 --> 34:48.010
I feel such a buffoon.

34:48.060 --> 34:51.010
My problem is I believe too much.

34:51.060 --> 34:53.810
Well, Margo, maybe it's
better than what I do.

34:53.860 --> 34:55.179
Hedging my bets...

34:57.180 --> 34:58.900
Mistrusting people.

35:36.180 --> 35:38.100
Is it ever going to stop?

35:40.060 --> 35:44.850
It appears that every time I come to
Corfu I make a rather large mistake.

35:44.900 --> 35:47.060
Yes, you do.

35:48.740 --> 35:51.050
Mrs Haddock was friendly,

35:51.100 --> 35:54.100
and your cousin Prue and
Geoffrey couldn't travel.

35:56.500 --> 35:58.980
I am perhaps short of friends.

36:01.180 --> 36:04.180
Are you sure you didn't tell
her anything about my husband?

36:05.460 --> 36:08.210
We did set forth together
from Victoria Station

36:08.260 --> 36:10.740
and in the long hours she
may have coaxed me to...

36:12.500 --> 36:14.650
I think the word is 'blab'.

36:14.700 --> 36:17.380
Oh, Auntie.

36:21.420 --> 36:24.370
I've decided to leave you in peace.

36:24.420 --> 36:26.380
Leave and go where? It's a monsoon.

36:27.380 --> 36:29.140
Nevertheless...

36:36.780 --> 36:40.460
She used a little thread
to pull over the pan, look.

36:42.020 --> 36:43.900
Thank you, Sherlock.

36:45.220 --> 36:47.100
Sherlock Holmes.

36:48.460 --> 36:50.580
Please read one book.

36:58.260 --> 37:01.540
Come on, then. Give me the stupid test.

37:03.740 --> 37:07.570
So, it was Mrs Haddock who messed
up my painting, just to spook us.

37:07.620 --> 37:11.540
No, I think it was the donkey.
I've seen her licking paint.

37:13.060 --> 37:15.530
Like me, nourished by art.

37:15.580 --> 37:18.090
Ah, wait.

37:18.140 --> 37:20.810
Leslie, I'm disappointed
you hadn't asked me

37:20.860 --> 37:22.850
to contribute to the entertainment.

37:22.900 --> 37:25.250
Oh, sorry.

37:25.800 --> 37:27.820
So, I'd like to... now.

37:29.180 --> 37:31.450
I want to read a poem about your father.

37:31.500 --> 37:36.100
And when it's over, we'll direct
our eyes firmly on the future.

37:47.820 --> 37:51.690
'They are not long, the
weeping and the laughter,

37:51.740 --> 37:55.730
Love and desire and hate:

37:55.780 --> 37:59.450
I think they have no portion in us

37:59.500 --> 38:02.530
After we pass the gate

38:02.580 --> 38:07.570
They are not long, the
days of wine and roses

38:07.620 --> 38:10.810
Out of a misty dream

38:10.860 --> 38:14.210
Our path emerges for a while

38:14.260 --> 38:18.460
Then closes, within a dream.'

38:47.540 --> 38:54.340
Perfect. Finally. No people. No
animals. And no indoor flooding.

38:57.360 --> 38:58.270
(Right...)

38:58.820 --> 39:01.290
And... start now.

39:07.660 --> 39:10.290
- Gerry?
- Can you hear it?

39:10.340 --> 39:12.500
What? There's nothing.

39:14.260 --> 39:18.180
No... Birdsong.

39:28.500 --> 39:29.440
Ah-ha!

39:44.740 --> 39:47.650
It's almost worth being
cooped up for so long.

40:01.100 --> 40:04.370
For God's sake, Gerry, come back
up here and bloody learn something!

40:04.420 --> 40:06.820
(Ignore him, Gerry.)

40:15.500 --> 40:17.780
What a strange couple of days.

40:44.660 --> 40:48.570
Ah, I am so sorry I couldn't visit you.

40:48.620 --> 40:51.450
I've spent the last 48
hours desperately trying

40:51.500 --> 40:53.370
- to save my olive crop.
- And did you?

40:53.420 --> 40:55.460
Just.

40:57.180 --> 40:58.890
How have you been?

40:58.940 --> 41:02.010
Well... er... don't know where to start.

41:02.060 --> 41:05.250
Larry's had his eyes
glued to his genitals.

41:05.300 --> 41:08.570
Oh. Well that's...
something to do, isn't it?

41:08.620 --> 41:12.090
He's worried about infertility.
And we had a seance.

41:12.140 --> 41:15.180
Oh, gosh. Did... er...
any dead people show up?

41:16.180 --> 41:17.850
No.

41:17.900 --> 41:19.890
- Hugh!
- Margo!

41:19.940 --> 41:22.490
Oh, and you missed Margo
wearing a cabbage on her face.

41:22.540 --> 41:24.330
- Oh, what a shame.
- Mm-hm.

41:24.380 --> 41:27.820
I have a surprise for you
all. Especially you, Gerry.

41:29.900 --> 41:32.810
Now, I have studied the
Durrells and their household,

41:32.860 --> 41:35.250
and there is one thing missing.

41:35.300 --> 41:37.970
- A Webley mk II air rifle?
- A toilet inside the house?

41:38.020 --> 41:41.250
- Intellectual curiosity?
- More animals.

41:45.020 --> 41:49.530
Thank you! Oh, we still
talk about Widdle and Puke.

41:49.580 --> 41:51.810
- They were two puppies we had.
- Oh.

41:51.860 --> 41:55.490
- We need a name.
- What about Leslie?

41:55.540 --> 41:57.370
No.

41:57.420 --> 42:00.530
Look, Hugh, I'm worried
about my Aunt Hermione.

42:00.580 --> 42:05.450
She took off yesterday in the
rain. She told me she was lonely.

42:05.500 --> 42:10.050
I'm sure she'll be fine. She
sounds like a tough old bird.

42:10.100 --> 42:13.570
But that's a sham, isn't
it? I mean, nobody's tough.

42:13.620 --> 42:17.330
My husband seemed strong,
and he couldn't be alone

42:17.380 --> 42:20.490
for more than half an hour.

42:20.540 --> 42:22.420
But he is now.

42:27.700 --> 42:30.170
Say hello to Thunder.

42:30.220 --> 42:32.930
Hello, Thunder.

42:38.740 --> 42:41.450
Good to be back in the haunted house.

42:41.500 --> 42:43.610
Larry, how are the swellings?

42:43.660 --> 42:45.610
Under control, thanks.

42:45.660 --> 42:48.050
Mrs Durrells, I bring you guests, again.

42:48.100 --> 42:53.610
Louisa, my dear. Having decided
I'd be enough of a burden...

42:53.660 --> 42:58.370
- No -- - On a whim, I stayed in a
guest house, where I met Mr Anestis.

42:58.420 --> 43:00.290
Kalimera.

43:00.340 --> 43:02.290
Kalimera.

43:02.340 --> 43:04.170
Kalimera.

43:04.220 --> 43:05.970
So, have you... have you got plans?

43:06.020 --> 43:08.170
No, I don't think that
would be wise, do you?

43:08.220 --> 43:12.530
Let's take the days one by one.

43:12.580 --> 43:14.530
One by one.

43:14.580 --> 43:16.530
I feel very alive.

43:16.580 --> 43:21.330
Ah, yes! Yes, so do we. It's
something about this place.

43:21.380 --> 43:23.170
Shall we?

43:23.220 --> 43:25.140
Yes.

43:31.940 --> 43:35.570
I hear that your Vasilia
has caught the mumps.

43:35.620 --> 43:39.690
Oh. She didn't give it to me.

43:39.740 --> 43:41.970
I should go and see her.

43:42.020 --> 43:44.530
Still, at least I know
I can make babies now.

43:44.580 --> 43:48.660
- No, Larry, don't have a baby
with Vasilia. - Anybody else!

43:55.700 --> 43:57.860
- Goodbye, Durrells.
- Bye, Spiro.

43:58.860 --> 44:02.900
Larry, wait, I'll give you a
ride. You'll need your energy.

44:08.220 --> 44:10.170
Your spots look much better.

44:10.220 --> 44:12.170
I thought you hadn't noticed them.

44:12.220 --> 44:15.530
Ah. Yes, I did say that.

44:15.580 --> 44:18.500
Thank you. Power of cabbage.

44:40.580 --> 44:42.940
I want to look after you, my angel.

44:47.820 --> 44:49.580
What did I say?

44:51.500 --> 44:54.220
My husband Lawrence used to call me that.

44:56.820 --> 44:59.980
So... erm... is that all right?

45:03.140 --> 45:04.860
Yes, it is.

45:06.020 --> 45:09.100
In fact, it's perfect.

45:21.700 --> 45:26.420
You know, for the first time,
I feel like I'm all yours.

45:40.660 --> 45:42.050
Let's have a cricket match.

45:42.100 --> 45:45.570
The Greeks will be thrashed, the British
will be hated and it'll be my fault.

45:45.620 --> 45:48.210
Oh, I feel like a doctor!

45:48.260 --> 45:51.530
- Play!
- Yes!

45:51.580 --> 45:54.660
I tried so hard to make this a happy day!

45:55.900 --> 45:56.730
- Mum!
- In you come.

45:58.780 --> 46:00.690
What are you bloody doing?

46:00.740 --> 46:02.500
Propose to me!
