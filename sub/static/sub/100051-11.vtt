Uh, Your Honor, pursuant
to People v. Molineux,

29:14.317 --> 29:16.624
the State seeks to include
evidence of two prior rapes

29:16.667 --> 29:17.799

29:17.843 --> 29:19.845
one in 2018, one in 2016.

29:19.888 --> 29:22.238

Mr. Carisi.

29:22.282 --> 29:23.631
Neither woman filed a report?

29:23.674 --> 29:25.938
- Not at the time,
but they have gone on record.

29:25.981 --> 29:27.766
The assaults described
go to modus operandi.

29:27.809 --> 29:30.246
There are consistent details
in all three victims' accounts.

29:30.290 --> 29:32.509
- Because they were coached.

29:32.553 --> 29:34.816
Your Honor, these women
only came forward

Ms. Russo's lawyer on TV.

their stories?

can cross on motive.

29:48.874 --> 29:50.919
These women have nothing
to gain.

to make a accusation

be willing to come forward,

29:59.798 --> 30:01.843

are unsubstantiated,

about collusion.
