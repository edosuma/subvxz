00:10.190 --> 00:14.889
Brother and sister,
together we'll make it through

00:17.164 --> 00:22.761
Someday a spirit will lift you
and take you there

00:23.871 --> 00:25.738
l know you've been hurtin'

00:25.739 --> 00:30.019
But l'll be there waitin'
to be there for you

00:30.144 --> 00:35.207
And l'll be there just helpin' you out
whenever l can

00:35.616 --> 00:36.883
'Cause

00:36.884 --> 00:41.685
Everybody's free
to feel good

00:43.524 --> 00:48.587
Everybody's free
to feel good

00:50.564 --> 00:53.064
Everybody's free

00:55.000 --> 01:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:21.428 --> 01:24.226
Everybody's free

01:38.012 --> 01:39.278
No! No!

01:39.279 --> 01:42.215
l don't want to go back!
l'm not done finding myself.

01:42.216 --> 01:43.483
- You gotta!
- No!

01:43.484 --> 01:47.220
Please, Brock. l feel amazing!
l never want the night to end.

01:47.221 --> 01:50.056
You can't run away
from your life forever, Doc!

01:50.057 --> 01:52.692
This is my life now, mom.
Deal with it!

01:52.693 --> 01:56.162
You got responsibilities at home.
The bills are stacking up...

01:56.163 --> 01:59.298
and you have to deal
with what happened to the boys.

01:59.299 --> 02:03.269
Screw the boys! l want to stay here with
my new family and their feel-good candy.

02:03.270 --> 02:06.439
- You've had your fun, Doc, it's time.
- No, Brock.

02:06.440 --> 02:08.374
No! This is Sky.

02:08.375 --> 02:13.176
We're going to have a child!
Please!

02:37.204 --> 02:39.205
But we're the Venture brothers!

02:39.206 --> 02:40.907
Shouldn't we work together?

02:40.908 --> 02:44.444
What does it take to get rid of you,
you parasite? Tweezers and a match?

02:44.445 --> 02:48.047
l give you life, l give you half my stuff,
l gave you the X-2 for God sake!

02:48.048 --> 02:50.783
What more do you want?!
My blood? Here! Take it!

02:50.784 --> 02:54.887
Take my blood! Or better yet,
just climb right on back inside me!

02:54.888 --> 02:57.290
Go on! Jump back in there.
Come on!

02:57.291 --> 03:00.726
Fine. Never mind. Just let me
get my stuff from the lab and l'll go.

03:00.727 --> 03:04.230
- The lab. Try my lab.
- Mine, yours. What's the difference?

03:04.231 --> 03:07.600
We're the Venture brothers!
What's mine is yours.

03:07.601 --> 03:11.370
Yeah, yeah. You're very generous
with my things. Look, Twiki...

03:11.371 --> 03:14.941
l have some very, very big government
contracts l gotta get cracking on!

03:14.942 --> 03:18.678
l'm very, very, very back in action,
and there are many, many bills to pay.

03:18.679 --> 03:21.747
Super! l could use your help.
l've got most of them complete.

03:21.748 --> 03:23.683
l think there are two left. Yeah.

03:23.684 --> 03:29.021
The sound that kills and a teleporter.
Dibs on the killing sound.

03:29.022 --> 03:31.557
Dibs? Screw you!
Those are my contracts!

03:31.558 --> 03:35.027
They were addressed to Dr. Venture,
and since you've been gone...

03:35.028 --> 03:38.698
l've received two doctorates.
So l'm a Dr. Venture, too.

03:38.699 --> 03:41.367
- l was only gone a month.
- You can have the teleporter.

03:41.368 --> 03:44.370
- Fine. l'll clean up your mess.
- Great! l'm half done with it.

03:44.371 --> 03:47.640
lt's in the manufacturing wing.
l put your staff on the job.

03:47.641 --> 03:50.977
Wait. l have a manufacturing wing?
l have a staff?

03:50.978 --> 03:52.645
l did this.

03:52.646 --> 03:54.313
l let this happen to them.

03:54.314 --> 03:58.784
- The boys were in my charge, and l failed!
- lt's not your fault. These things happen.

03:58.785 --> 04:00.419
What is it with you people?

04:00.420 --> 04:04.824
The children were cut down in their prime,
and my negligence is to blame.

04:04.825 --> 04:07.793
- Hate me!
- All right. Fine, l hate you.

04:07.794 --> 04:10.696
You hungry?
Thinkin' about making grilled cheese.

04:10.697 --> 04:15.201
l accept your hatred! Now l don't want
to worry you with the particulars...

04:15.202 --> 04:19.137
but l am by trade a necromancer!
You know what that means, right?

04:19.139 --> 04:23.209
- That you have sex with dead people.
- Phile. Necrophile!

04:23.210 --> 04:25.945
A necromancer can bring the dead...

04:25.946 --> 04:27.480
to life!

04:27.481 --> 04:29.715
- He was right.
- No, here. Switch it, switch it.

04:29.716 --> 04:31.884
No, look here. Righty tighty, lefty loosy.

04:31.885 --> 04:34.353
- l don't know.
- Come on, man. Eyes down here!

04:34.354 --> 04:35.855
Where are you looking?

04:35.856 --> 04:40.259
How the hell did they get in here?!
l padlocked this wing years ago.

04:40.260 --> 04:43.029
Rusty! How ya doing?
Long time no see!

04:43.030 --> 04:45.798
Not again.
Just let me take the lD's out.

04:45.799 --> 04:48.768
Here. Now you can't kill me.
Hobo code, right?

04:48.769 --> 04:51.237
This one always a kidder.
l know him for 30 years!

04:51.238 --> 04:53.005
Swifty, say hi to Rusty.

04:53.006 --> 04:55.441
He was so flipped up,
turned around, and--

04:55.442 --> 04:57.410
Whoever you are,
l don't want any trouble.

04:57.411 --> 04:59.612
Just pack up
your little shantytown and leave.

04:59.613 --> 05:04.933
You really don't remember me?
All those adventures we had?

05:05.185 --> 05:07.620
That little brown boy saved your life.

05:07.621 --> 05:11.390
This Aztec calendar
says today is your lucky day!

05:11.391 --> 05:13.891
Can we keep him, pa?

05:24.805 --> 05:27.240
- Yeah. No. No, not ringing a bell.
- JJ?

05:27.241 --> 05:28.641
Hey, hon. You ready?

05:28.642 --> 05:30.743
- Just a sec.
- Hello!

05:30.744 --> 05:33.512
- Tell me she works here, too.
- My ride to the marina.

05:33.513 --> 05:37.316
- Well, l'll be seeing you, big brother.
- You're leaving me with these people?

05:37.317 --> 05:41.621
Yep. Off to Spider-Skull lsland.
Did you bring your bi-kini?

05:41.622 --> 05:45.825
- One for me and one for Colette.
- Go, Team Venture!

05:45.826 --> 05:47.927
l used to be pretty.

05:47.928 --> 05:51.796
Yeah, but not no more.
Look at my nose.

05:55.936 --> 05:57.970
What the...?
Are you raping me?!

05:57.971 --> 06:00.740
- No. Well, l was gonna, but...
- Gonna?!

06:00.741 --> 06:03.075
- What the f--, King?
- l couldn't get it up.

06:03.076 --> 06:06.178
You felt too much like a girl,
l couldn't get into it!

06:06.179 --> 06:07.680
Wait. Wait a... What?

06:07.681 --> 06:10.516
This isn't even my cell!
What, did you take me to your place?!

06:10.517 --> 06:13.477
Well, l got porn here. lt helps.

06:16.923 --> 06:18.824
Hank!

06:18.825 --> 06:20.393
Dean!

06:20.394 --> 06:21.494
Head.

06:21.495 --> 06:22.762
On my head.

06:22.763 --> 06:25.931
My apologies. l didn't see you...
Wait, perhaps you could help.

06:25.932 --> 06:29.335
From your helmet l can judge that
you've been here long enough to know...

06:29.336 --> 06:33.639
Yes, pilgrim! l, in life,
was a personal guard to the great Caesar!

06:33.640 --> 06:37.043
Liar! You choked on a popsicle stick
at a Halloween party.

06:37.044 --> 06:39.312
- Tell everyone, why don't you?!
- Everybody knows.

06:39.313 --> 06:41.280
You're in hell 'cause you're a f-- liar.

06:41.281 --> 06:44.650
Well, l'm trying to find
the souls of two innocents.

06:44.651 --> 06:48.815
One, Dean,
has rust-colored hair.

06:48.855 --> 06:51.949
The other, Hank, is tow-headed.

06:54.394 --> 06:56.796
And l ask for...

06:56.797 --> 06:58.130
Teleporter.

06:58.131 --> 07:01.400
Money in the bank.
So this baby is almost finished, right?

07:01.401 --> 07:02.735
Don't quote me on this...

07:02.736 --> 07:07.173
but l believe there was a ring,
and l loved the radio.

07:07.174 --> 07:09.975
- What is he talking about?
- Swifty's a little punchy.

07:09.976 --> 07:12.645
He was a prize fighter
but after his brain went soft...

07:12.646 --> 07:15.281
his wife left him
and your father put him to work here.

07:15.282 --> 07:18.351
My dad's dead.
So, Swifty, you're fired.

07:18.352 --> 07:20.453
Your...your father died?

07:20.454 --> 07:22.521
Like 20 years ago!
Where have you been?

07:22.522 --> 07:24.557
Here. 20 years?

07:24.558 --> 07:28.160
l'm 45? l haven't even kissed a girl yet!

07:28.161 --> 07:31.063
My God. That's sad.
Well, you're fired, too.

07:31.064 --> 07:34.500
- So, we just leave?
- Yes.

07:36.803 --> 07:40.293
Where's the...?
Where's the door out?

07:41.108 --> 07:42.775
Those uniforms
are Venture property.

07:42.776 --> 07:44.610
Can you leave them
in the bathroom hamper?

07:44.611 --> 07:45.911
From the...government.

07:45.912 --> 07:48.581
Half-done, my ass.
Looks good to me!

07:48.582 --> 07:50.983
l'll tart it up
with a coat of baby blue enamel...

07:50.984 --> 07:54.620
and ship her off to the government.
Oh, come on!

07:54.621 --> 07:59.091
No wonder my power bill's
been through the roof.

08:00.560 --> 08:03.060
What now?

08:16.176 --> 08:18.944
l got the stuff.
How are you doing with Phase Two?

08:18.945 --> 08:21.247
Just finishing up.
All right. Here.

08:21.248 --> 08:25.251
They don't hand-write mircodots
on the outside. They use, like, computers.

08:25.252 --> 08:28.988
They don't use photos of Macaulay Culkin
as money on the outside either.

08:28.989 --> 08:31.490
And they don't have
tiny men in their employ.

08:31.491 --> 08:36.061
- Can't believe they let you keep those.
- They think a hobby aids in rehabilitation.

08:36.062 --> 08:40.265
lt's only fair. l mean, Catlady gets
to keep her cats. Beetlebomb, his beetles.

08:40.267 --> 08:42.868
And King Gorilla's
got all those Tarzans.

08:42.869 --> 08:43.903
There.

08:43.904 --> 08:46.338
Fly! Fly, my pet!

08:46.339 --> 08:49.175
Let the beating of your wings
ignite the hurricane...

08:49.176 --> 08:51.804
of my glorious second coming!

08:51.845 --> 08:53.579
Tell the world...

08:53.580 --> 08:56.080
The Monarch shall return!

09:01.021 --> 09:02.721
Eagle-1 to Guild Base-5.

09:02.722 --> 09:05.424
Have intercepted message
from Butterfly to Cocoon.

09:05.425 --> 09:07.927
- Ready to transmit data.
- Copy, Tiny Eagle.

09:07.928 --> 09:10.196
Ready to receive.

09:10.197 --> 09:13.866
''Hello, friend. Good news.
Fantastic Caribbean Getaway...''

09:13.867 --> 09:17.837
ldiot! lt's printing from memory!
When was the last time you put paper in?

09:17.838 --> 09:21.941
l told you, you can't run the microwave
and the blow-dryer at the same time.

09:21.942 --> 09:23.742
They're on the same circ--

09:23.743 --> 09:27.179
What the hell are you doing?
How did you even do that?

09:27.180 --> 09:28.547
- Don't do that!
- Doc?

09:28.548 --> 09:30.382
Lab!

09:30.383 --> 09:34.342
- Doc!
- My --ing brother is an idiot!

09:34.387 --> 09:37.389
- Should l ask?
- Teleporter. This is all l need.

09:37.390 --> 09:41.060
Your legs are sticking out of the TV.
Where's the rest of you?

09:41.061 --> 09:43.496
l can't tell, hold on.
Wait, did you hear that?

09:43.497 --> 09:46.732
- l just threw something.
- Wait, do it again.

09:46.733 --> 09:49.693
- No.
- OK, just a sec, l'll...

09:50.437 --> 09:54.106
l just put my hand in sludge.
Oh, don't tell me!

09:54.107 --> 09:57.810
l think the rest of me
is in the bathroom.

09:57.811 --> 10:01.580
My clock is blinking twelve!
l think the power went out!

10:01.581 --> 10:03.282
- What are you doing?
- l like digging.

10:03.283 --> 10:06.185
Can't a man leave his home
with a shovel without an inquisition?

10:06.186 --> 10:09.221
No. Dad, you have to let them go.

10:09.222 --> 10:12.324
l can't. Sweetie, l can feel them.

10:12.325 --> 10:16.028
They are between worlds.
They can be raised!

10:16.029 --> 10:19.431
lt's so simple.
l just need their bodies and their souls.

10:19.432 --> 10:23.235
But l can't find their souls!
How do you lose a soul?

10:23.236 --> 10:25.170
- They're not like car keys.
- Stop it!

10:25.171 --> 10:27.573
- You don't simply misplace them.
- Stop it!

10:27.574 --> 10:30.709
l don't even want to think
about them as zombies!

10:30.710 --> 10:32.177
No, no, sweetie.

10:32.178 --> 10:34.780
Zombies are animated
bodies without souls.

10:34.781 --> 10:38.284
This is a regular resurrection.
Stop crying, pumpkin.

10:38.285 --> 10:40.219
l've done this hundreds of times.

10:40.220 --> 10:43.389
David Blaine, Evel Knievel,
both daddy's clients.

10:43.390 --> 10:45.391
As was Ronald Reagan
till he bounced a check.

10:45.392 --> 10:46.859
- l'm gonna throw up.
- Pumpkin, no.

10:46.860 --> 10:51.490
This is routine!
l just raise this sword and go...

10:53.967 --> 10:56.402
Rise and be one with the living!

10:56.403 --> 10:58.704
lt's all very humdrum.
Let me get the door.

10:58.705 --> 11:00.739
Now, don't touch any of this.

11:00.740 --> 11:03.609
You could accidentally
make the cats huge or something.

11:03.610 --> 11:06.570
Yes, l heard you the first time.

11:08.381 --> 11:10.881
Milkshake.

11:16.856 --> 11:20.426
While it is comforting to see my legs,
it's not really fixing anything.

11:20.427 --> 11:23.395
l don't know, Doc.
l'm just trying to help.

11:23.396 --> 11:25.998
Maybe if we put all of your parts
back in the machine...

11:25.999 --> 11:28.400
- Right. Like in that Jeff Goldblum movie.
- Yeah. See?

11:28.401 --> 11:31.637
We still can't find my right side,
which l'm now certain is outdoors.

11:31.638 --> 11:32.671
How come?

11:32.672 --> 11:35.374
Because it's raining on a third of me.
l'm freezing.

11:35.375 --> 11:39.645
l discovered my nipples work as a team.
Come here. Feel this grab eye l got going.

11:39.646 --> 11:44.984
- l believe you.
- No. Really. Feel it! lt's like a pencil eraser.

11:44.985 --> 11:47.353
- We have a door, Orpheus.
- Oh, no!

11:47.354 --> 11:50.422
You, too, are trapped between worlds!

11:50.423 --> 11:52.091
- What have l done?!
- Relax.

11:52.092 --> 11:55.628
- Doc did that to himself.
- My stupid brother did this.

11:55.629 --> 11:58.030
l have destroyed your life!

11:58.031 --> 12:00.699
l have brought your sons back...

12:00.700 --> 12:03.464
as soulless zombies!

12:03.503 --> 12:07.606
So, is everyone clear
on what his or her job is?

12:07.607 --> 12:09.475
Tigerrific? You look pensive.

12:09.476 --> 12:11.944
There's no way
l can tear the gates down.

12:11.945 --> 12:15.748
- l'm not even close to strong enough!
- Don't sell yourself short, man.

12:15.749 --> 12:18.884
l once watched you cleave
an eyewitness news van in twain!

12:18.885 --> 12:22.121
All costume. l don't have
any powers without that thing.

12:22.122 --> 12:25.157
No powers? l thought you were,
like, half tiger or something.

12:25.158 --> 12:27.359
- No!
- Raised by tigers then?

12:27.360 --> 12:28.394
Like Moogli?

12:28.395 --> 12:31.363
Mowgli!
And that was wolves. But still no.

12:31.364 --> 12:35.000
You know, l could pull the gate off.
Kinda wasted as lookout anyway.

12:35.001 --> 12:36.368
Sure you're strong enough?

12:36.369 --> 12:39.171
l don't want you talkin' about,
''That's a gorilla suit.''

12:39.172 --> 12:41.774
- l can do it.
- Great! Then Tigerrific's on lookout.

12:41.775 --> 12:44.176
Or can't you see
without your tiger helmet?

12:44.177 --> 12:47.680
So, if no one has any questions...
Question? Mr. Monday.

12:47.681 --> 12:51.750
What exactly will my title be
for this new criminal syndicate of ours?

12:51.751 --> 12:53.585
Title? What? l don't know!

12:53.586 --> 12:55.988
l want to be President of Calendars!

12:55.989 --> 12:58.490
Whatever, crazy.
OK, anyone else?

12:58.491 --> 13:00.492
This is going to be so Monday-licious!

13:00.493 --> 13:02.561
Anyone not totally retarded?

13:02.562 --> 13:03.896
White Noise?

13:03.897 --> 13:06.865
This organization
ain't gonna be racially mixed, is it?

13:06.866 --> 13:09.735
l can't allow my pure white blood
to be...muddied.

13:09.736 --> 13:12.638
Do you even have blood?
l mean, you're, like, made out of static.

13:12.639 --> 13:15.507
- How do you even know you're white?
- l was white once...

13:15.508 --> 13:19.078
before my tragic life-altering
television repair accident.

13:19.079 --> 13:21.680
Fine. ldiot!
Can we move on?

13:21.681 --> 13:25.250
- So, right at lockdown tonight, we...
- Can we please wait till Monday?

13:25.251 --> 13:28.020
No! God, you're worse
than my old henchmen!

13:28.021 --> 13:32.257
Flames filled the crock-pit.
We all knew the score.

13:32.258 --> 13:35.027
Crimeodile hits the eject, saving me.

13:35.028 --> 13:37.896
He was like that,
his henchmen always came first.

13:37.897 --> 13:41.633
Anyway, Captain Sunshine kept on his tail,
kept on it, ship goes down...

13:41.634 --> 13:44.103
Captain Sunshine takes out
one more evil doer.

13:44.104 --> 13:48.640
Me, big deal. l'm out of a job, right?
Just like that. Sorry, Charlie.

13:48.641 --> 13:52.478
l think we've all been there.
Thank you for sharing that, Charlie.

13:52.479 --> 13:55.314
Does anyone else have anything to...
Yes? You.

13:55.315 --> 13:58.383
Yeah. Gary,
former henchman, scullion class.

13:58.384 --> 14:02.988
l could totally relate to Charlie's deal,
but, Charlie, don't give up hope, man.

14:02.989 --> 14:05.190
Escape pods,
got your secret parachutes...

14:05.191 --> 14:07.693
l wouldn't be surprised
if you go home tonight...

14:07.694 --> 14:11.430
and find a message
on your machine from Crimeodile.

14:11.431 --> 14:13.432
Gentlemen, please.
Gary, was it?

14:13.433 --> 14:18.971
Gary, the point of this group,
is not the enable the henching habit...

14:18.972 --> 14:21.306
but to learn
how to hench for ourselves.

14:21.307 --> 14:23.942
l hear what you're saying.
lnstead of being henchmen...

14:23.943 --> 14:26.912
we should become
Supervillains ourselves.

14:26.913 --> 14:30.516
- Now, that's not at all...
- Like in a beehive! When the queen dies.

14:30.517 --> 14:33.385
One of the workers eats, like,
a whole bunch of royal jelly...

14:33.386 --> 14:36.088
and he morphs
into the new queen.

14:36.089 --> 14:39.992
- No, gentlemen! Don't listen to...
- l have The Monarch's crown someplace.

14:39.993 --> 14:41.894
l can call myself ''The Viceroy!''

14:41.895 --> 14:43.796
- l like that!
- Can l use that?!

14:43.797 --> 14:44.997
No!

14:44.998 --> 14:47.699
That's why l've been looking
everywhere for their souls.

14:47.700 --> 14:50.102
Because l accidentally
resurrected their bodies!

14:50.103 --> 14:51.336
Wait. You saw their bodies?

14:51.337 --> 14:53.605
Saw them?!
l made them a --ing milkshake!

14:53.606 --> 14:56.441
- Nice. Way to go, Brock.
- Must have been that power surge.

14:56.442 --> 14:58.877
Who is your grief counselor?
Mother Teresa?

14:58.878 --> 15:01.146
How can you be
so nonchalant about this?

15:01.147 --> 15:05.184
My stupid talismans and l
have made movie monsters of your sons!

15:05.185 --> 15:07.905
l don't deserve to wear them!

15:08.121 --> 15:09.721
lt glows!

15:09.722 --> 15:12.024
Your sons' souls are near!

15:12.025 --> 15:14.193
OK, why don't you go home
and take a shower?

15:14.194 --> 15:17.462
- You're starting to hallucinate.
- No shower for Byron Orpheus!

15:17.463 --> 15:19.832
l can feel them, hear them.

15:19.833 --> 15:23.483
Your boys' souls
are in this very room!

15:23.503 --> 15:27.472
Will you stop with the soul crap?
There's a scientific explanation for this.

15:27.473 --> 15:30.175
They are speaking to me.
Their voices like thunder!

15:30.176 --> 15:32.678
lt's Dean!
Speak to me, son!

15:32.679 --> 15:35.147
- Will ya tell him already?
- What, and miss this? No way.

15:35.148 --> 15:37.850
Yes, l hear them!
Dean loves you!

15:37.851 --> 15:40.619
He understands and forgives you!

15:40.620 --> 15:45.724
But Hank, no, Hank is quite upset!
Rage, l can hear his rage!

15:45.725 --> 15:48.592
He calls you a crum-bum!

15:48.628 --> 15:51.663
Or maybe a crampon!
lt's hard to hear him.

15:51.664 --> 15:55.000
lsn't a crampon
a little hook for mountain climbing?

15:55.001 --> 15:57.469
- He's definitely calling me a crum-bum.
- Here!

15:57.470 --> 15:59.970
lt comes from this machine.

15:59.973 --> 16:02.473
What is this machine?

16:02.542 --> 16:04.443
That machine? Nothing.

16:04.444 --> 16:07.079
lt makes robots or something.
Oh, no!

16:07.080 --> 16:09.448
Have l made scary boy robots?!

16:09.449 --> 16:11.583
Oh, l should never
have played God!

16:11.584 --> 16:15.087
Doc, stop jerking the poor guy around
and just tell him.

16:15.088 --> 16:17.522
He's getting ectoplasm everywhere.

16:17.523 --> 16:19.591
This isn't a request, King.

16:19.592 --> 16:22.561
You and your Guild can go screw!
Ten years of payin' dues...

16:22.562 --> 16:25.464
and what did they do
to keep me out of here when l got caught?

16:25.465 --> 16:27.266
Oh, what could we do?

16:27.267 --> 16:30.569
You eviscerated and sodomized
Vince Neil on national television!

16:30.570 --> 16:32.537
l only sodomized half of him!

16:32.538 --> 16:35.407
They wanted The Surreal Life.
KG gave it to him.

16:35.408 --> 16:37.943
l'd just hate for you
to be in the shower one day...

16:37.944 --> 16:40.445
when out of the shadows
steps a man...

16:40.446 --> 16:43.916
with a smuggled-in
molecular destabilizer and zap!

16:43.917 --> 16:45.317
What was once your penis...

16:45.318 --> 16:48.921
is now a tasteful reproduction
Noguchi coffee table by Herman Miller.

16:48.922 --> 16:52.391
- l don't respond to threats, Limb.
- Of course you don't.

16:52.392 --> 16:56.428
Well, they don't call you
King Gorilla for nothing, do they?

16:56.429 --> 16:59.498
And what king is complete
without a queen?

16:59.499 --> 17:00.666
That's a cake.

17:00.667 --> 17:03.502
But what's inside it, l wonder?

17:03.503 --> 17:05.304
Marzipan?

17:05.305 --> 17:07.138
Tarz-ipan.

17:07.140 --> 17:09.308
Slow down.
What about the zombies?

17:09.309 --> 17:11.542
Now, l call those ''clone slugs.''

17:11.544 --> 17:14.012
Grew those years ago
from nail clippings, l think.

17:14.012 --> 17:17.249
Anyway, after the slugs
have been activated, that machine...

17:17.250 --> 17:18.550
- Purgatory.
- Whatever.

17:18.550 --> 17:21.987
That computer feeds all their
nocturnally recorded memory synapses.

17:21.988 --> 17:25.424
And memories, hopes, and dreams?
Their immortal soul!

17:25.425 --> 17:27.526
You're killing me with that crap.
Let me finish.

17:27.527 --> 17:31.163
That computer feeds synaptic data
to their incubation beds.

17:31.164 --> 17:33.765
That information is supplemented
with basic knowledge...

17:33.766 --> 17:36.335
that my dad recorded for me,
so l didn't have to go to school.

17:36.336 --> 17:39.938
And that is why l didn't lose
my virginity until l was 24.

17:39.939 --> 17:42.341
- That is awful!
- You didn't even see her. lt was horr--

17:42.342 --> 17:45.277
No, it is awful
that you would do this to your boys!

17:45.278 --> 17:47.980
- Please! You do this crap every day.
- That's different.

17:47.981 --> 17:50.349
Why? Because you call it
by a different name?

17:50.350 --> 17:54.820
Church-lab, souls-synapses,
purgatory-computer, get over yourself.

17:54.821 --> 17:57.055
- l must lie down.
- lf it makes you feel better...

17:57.056 --> 18:00.025
the ones you knew weren't the originals.
We've been through this...

18:00.026 --> 18:02.094
- How many times, Brock?
- This'll be fourteen.

18:02.095 --> 18:04.595
Fourteen times.

18:30.456 --> 18:32.324
We had a gas leak that time.

18:32.325 --> 18:33.658
The silent killer.

18:33.659 --> 18:36.159
Then this other time...

18:37.363 --> 18:38.597
l remember that.

18:38.598 --> 18:41.658
That was when we both grew the...

18:41.701 --> 18:44.403
Oh, God! l know, l know.
What were we thinking?

18:44.404 --> 18:49.954
Oh, that wasn't half as bad
as when l had those hair plugs.

18:53.346 --> 18:56.782
What is that? A royal jelly donut
you got there, you big queen?

18:56.783 --> 18:59.217
24? Get out of town! ls that you?

18:59.218 --> 19:00.986
Come here, you big lug!

19:00.987 --> 19:02.954
All right, all right. No touching.

19:02.955 --> 19:05.690
l can't believe that's what you look like
under your costume.

19:05.691 --> 19:08.627
Hilarious!
You look like Seinfeld with a unibrow.

19:08.628 --> 19:11.096
- Who knew?
- You should talk, all Kevin Smith.

19:11.097 --> 19:12.564
Oh, and here's a tip.

19:12.565 --> 19:16.401
A beard is not a substitute for a jaw line,
no matter how you trim it.

19:16.402 --> 19:19.496
You haven't changed, same old 24!

19:21.574 --> 19:23.341
- This is weird.
- Totally!

19:23.342 --> 19:25.777
When is The Monarch
going to bust out already?

19:25.778 --> 19:28.406
282, 283.

19:28.448 --> 19:30.449
OK, lockdown, gentlemen!

19:30.450 --> 19:33.260
- Close gates!
- Closing gates.

19:34.353 --> 19:35.787
- What the...?
- Hey, Monarch!

19:35.788 --> 19:37.956
What the hell are you doing
out of your cell?!

19:37.957 --> 19:42.617
You assholes! Tonight!
lt's supposed to be tonight!

19:47.567 --> 19:50.368
What the...?
What is this, Liquid Plumber?

19:50.369 --> 19:53.405
lt's that orange powder we use
when someone throws up.

19:53.406 --> 19:56.041
l got hit with a tiny little man.

19:56.042 --> 19:59.277
Monday!
There's my President of Calendars!

19:59.278 --> 20:02.348
Where's the big diversion? Hello?!

20:04.517 --> 20:06.985
Septapus! White Noise!
What are you doing?

20:06.986 --> 20:12.866
Remember those guards you were
supposed to take out? Guess what?!

20:13.126 --> 20:14.860
King!

20:14.861 --> 20:18.831
Anytime you feel like
making a move, buddy!

20:19.432 --> 20:21.366
Et tu, King Gorilla?

20:21.367 --> 20:23.201
l'm sorry, l can't.

20:23.202 --> 20:25.704
lt's a Guild thing.
Phantom Limb said...

20:25.705 --> 20:28.173
Phantom Limb?! He's doing this?!
Listen to me, King!

20:28.174 --> 20:30.475
King!
This has nothing to do with the Guild!

20:30.476 --> 20:34.279
He stole my girlfriend! He just wants me
out of the picture permanently!

20:34.280 --> 20:35.514
- Come on!
- King! King!

20:35.515 --> 20:37.449
A month in solitary
ought to chill you out.

20:37.450 --> 20:39.451
You chickensh-- bastards!

20:39.452 --> 20:42.721
This isn't the end of this!
The Monarch will return!

20:42.722 --> 20:44.956
You will...

20:44.957 --> 20:48.360
Come on!
The rest will be here any minute.

20:48.361 --> 20:49.961
King, this is hardly the time...

20:49.962 --> 20:51.930
Oh, my God, that's...

20:51.931 --> 20:55.800
The pipes empty out a mile from here.
l won't be able to hold them off for long.

20:55.801 --> 20:57.302
What changed your mind?

20:57.303 --> 20:59.704
Believe it or not...love.

20:59.705 --> 21:02.474
lt was there in your eyes
when you spoke of your girlfriend.

21:02.475 --> 21:06.011
l always thought you were a schmuck,
but what kind of monster would l be...

21:06.012 --> 21:09.277
to stand in the way of love?

21:11.284 --> 21:13.685
Go find her. Get her back.

21:13.686 --> 21:18.496
And when you do,
you love her and you never let go!

21:19.358 --> 21:21.660
lt's all too much.

21:21.661 --> 21:25.230
l... l...
What am l going to tell my daughter?

21:25.231 --> 21:27.766
Tell her what l tell everybody
when this crap happens.

21:27.767 --> 21:29.968
- The boys never die.
- But they did!

21:29.969 --> 21:33.104
They shed their mortal coil
as a snake sheds its skin.

21:33.105 --> 21:36.641
Stop it! They are Hank and Dean.
They have all the same memories...

21:36.642 --> 21:39.044
same annoying tendencies,
same everything.

21:39.045 --> 21:42.080
Look, if you have a clumsy child,
you make them wear a helmet.

21:42.081 --> 21:45.784
lf you have death-prone children,
you keep a few clones of them in your lab.

21:45.785 --> 21:48.887
Speak of the devils!
Their half-formed ears must be burning.

21:48.888 --> 21:51.189
Brock, you should
put them back in the oven.

21:51.190 --> 21:54.626
l hate touching them.
They feel like giant...

21:54.627 --> 21:56.261
Stretch Armstrongs.

21:56.262 --> 21:58.363
Split between life and death.

21:58.364 --> 22:00.599
The universe weeps for them.

22:00.600 --> 22:03.835
Hank, you are never to call your father
a crum-bum in front of company.

22:03.836 --> 22:07.272
And where are your manners?
What do you have to say to Dr. Orpheus?

22:07.273 --> 22:10.265
Go, Team Venture!

22:41.674 --> 22:43.441
Thank God you guys are here.

22:43.442 --> 22:45.110
l thought the whole plan got...

22:45.111 --> 22:46.344
What?

22:46.345 --> 22:49.371
¡Qué sopa más buena!
