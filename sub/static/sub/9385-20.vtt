WEBVTT

00:38.288 --> 00:39.581
I say, it's 4:00, away with you.

00:39.665 --> 00:41.250
-Stewie!
-Change it back!

00:41.333 --> 00:43.210
Oh, forget it-- Jolly Farm Review is on.

00:43.293 --> 00:45.087
It's the latest indoctrinating pabulum

00:45.170 --> 00:46.338
for children with not enough to do.

00:46.421 --> 00:47.422
Hey.

00:48.382 --> 00:49.383
Shut up.

00:54.429 --> 00:56.390
Wakey, wakey, children.

00:56.473 --> 00:58.600
( British accents ):
Good morning, Mother Maggie.

00:58.684 --> 00:59.685
The sun has risen

00:59.768 --> 01:01.562
on another day in Jolly Farm.

01:01.645 --> 01:04.690
Let's see what life's rich
pageant has in store for us.

01:04.773 --> 01:06.984
Oh, she has the voice of an angel.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.278
Not to mention a balcony
you could do Shakespeare from.

01:09.778 --> 01:11.572
Play your song, Melody Sheep

01:11.655 --> 01:14.032
to aid the little one's nourishment.

01:14.116 --> 01:15.492
But play softly

01:15.576 --> 01:17.619
for Pengrove Pig wishes to read aloud...

01:17.703 --> 01:21.081
BOTH: From his Magic Tome that holds
every book ever written!

01:21.164 --> 01:23.834
"These were difficult times
for the children of Ipswich

01:23.917 --> 01:26.461
when the lollipop famine cursed
their pleasant village... "

01:26.545 --> 01:28.755
How can you stand watching this?

01:29.548 --> 01:31.466
It's dreck and you know it.

01:31.550 --> 01:33.385
Oh, don't have the guts to respond, huh?

01:33.468 --> 01:35.262
No intelligent defense
of this unmitigated crap?

01:35.679 --> 01:36.680
Commercial!

01:36.763 --> 01:37.764
( groans )

01:37.848 --> 01:39.016
I'm going to get some graham crackers.

01:42.519 --> 01:45.439
Welcome back to Kiss Forum,
Rhode Island public access's

01:45.522 --> 01:46.899
most popular show about Kiss.

01:46.982 --> 01:48.567
Lois hurry, it's back on!

01:48.650 --> 01:51.778
Calm down, Peter, you know I
wouldn't miss a second of this.

01:51.862 --> 01:54.489
Okay, let's take a call.
You're on Kiss Forum.

01:54.573 --> 01:56.241
MAN: Kiss rules! Whoo!

01:56.325 --> 01:58.118
( chuckles ): Okay, good call, good call.

01:58.202 --> 02:00.370
All right, hey, you're on Kiss Forum.

02:00.454 --> 02:01.830
MAN #2: Yeah. Kiss sucks.

02:01.914 --> 02:03.040
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

02:03.123 --> 02:04.666
Trace the call, trace the call.

02:04.750 --> 02:07.753
Yeah, um, they suck big time.
They bite ass.

02:07.836 --> 02:09.671
Wait a second, I recognize that voice.

02:09.755 --> 02:12.174
Is this Dennis De Young,
lead singer from Styx?

02:12.257 --> 02:13.634
Come clean, man.

02:13.717 --> 02:16.386
Yeah, yeah, it's me. It's Dennis.

02:16.470 --> 02:19.223
Dennis, you jealous douche,
how about I crank a little

02:19.306 --> 02:21.642
"Detroit Rock City"
and play "Come Sail Away"

02:21.725 --> 02:24.937
and we can see how they stack up
side by side, huh?!

02:25.020 --> 02:27.147
You want that, you high-voiced bastard?!

02:27.231 --> 02:28.690
We'll be right back after this.

02:28.774 --> 02:31.193
Hey, didn't see you come in.

02:31.276 --> 02:33.028
We're just getting into shape
for our upcoming tour.

02:33.111 --> 02:35.989
We're playing five big show in five days.

02:36.073 --> 02:38.575
-So, if you're...
-Rock and roll!

02:38.659 --> 02:42.412
Why don't you just sit
in the corner, huh? Go on.

02:42.496 --> 02:45.332
So, if you're a Kiss fan
and you live in the Northeast

02:45.415 --> 02:46.750
come out for all five shows

02:46.834 --> 02:49.002
of what we're calling "Kiss-Stock."

02:49.086 --> 02:50.587
Aw, hell, the Northeast?

02:50.671 --> 02:52.256
You know, it's times like this

02:52.339 --> 02:55.175
I curse the fact that we live
in French Polynesia.

02:55.259 --> 02:56.718
No, Peter, we're in the Northeast.

02:56.802 --> 02:57.803
We are?

02:57.886 --> 03:00.180
And Kiss is coming to the Northeast.

03:00.264 --> 03:03.851
Th-That means... uh...

03:03.934 --> 03:04.935
That means...

03:05.018 --> 03:06.103
No, no, Lois, don't help me.

03:07.771 --> 03:09.898
It means we can do something...

03:09.982 --> 03:12.401
Come on, Peter, you're almost there.

03:13.902 --> 03:15.279
( drilling )

03:15.362 --> 03:16.738
We can go to Kiss-Stock!

03:16.822 --> 03:17.990
( screams )

03:24.288 --> 03:25.330
PETER: Hey, yo, Lois!

03:25.414 --> 03:27.249
-What?
-I'm packing for Kiss-Stock.

03:27.374 --> 03:28.834
I can't find my favorite underwear.

03:28.917 --> 03:30.794
The pair with the rip
in the right butt cheek

03:30.878 --> 03:32.171
from when you stepped on them
pulling them up

03:32.254 --> 03:34.631
in the airplane bathroom
from when you had the trots?

03:34.715 --> 03:36.633
No, no, the pair
with the hole in the left butt cheek

03:36.717 --> 03:38.051
from when I held it in for two hours

03:38.135 --> 03:39.386
'cause it was that extra long

03:39.469 --> 03:40.721
Palm Sunday Church sermon

03:40.804 --> 03:42.764
and I thought blowing gas
would offend Jesus

03:42.848 --> 03:44.600
so I let it go in the vestibule after mass

03:44.683 --> 03:46.351
and it sounded like Louis Armstrong?

03:46.435 --> 03:47.519
Oh, bottom drawer.

03:48.187 --> 03:49.855
Children, tell Mother Maggie

03:49.938 --> 03:51.481
what you want to be when you grow up?

03:51.565 --> 03:53.275
-A scientist.
-A novelist.

03:53.358 --> 03:54.443
A Cambridge don.

03:54.526 --> 03:55.694
Oh, what's my future

03:55.777 --> 03:57.321
coming from these squalid surroundings?

03:57.446 --> 03:59.656
Getting into a fight
with some dude at the Laundromat

03:59.740 --> 04:01.366
'cause he was hitting on my baby's mama?

04:01.450 --> 04:02.826
I should be there, not here.

04:05.120 --> 04:07.039
London...

04:07.122 --> 04:08.415
Hey, Dad, can me and Meg

04:08.498 --> 04:09.625
stay up late every night

04:09.708 --> 04:11.084
while you're at Kiss-Stock?

04:11.168 --> 04:12.628
You can do whatever you want, son

04:12.711 --> 04:14.630
just don't eat from the Candy tree.

04:14.713 --> 04:17.508
He's right to caution you.
I feed on children.

04:18.258 --> 04:19.301
( screams )

04:19.384 --> 04:21.637
You don't mind watching Stewie
for a few days, do you, Brian?

04:21.929 --> 04:24.348
No, ever since Jolly Farm Review came on

04:24.431 --> 04:26.266
he's been pretty distracted--
it'll be a breeze.

04:26.350 --> 04:27.809
Well, bye, everyone.

04:27.893 --> 04:30.229
I can't believe my stupid
parents are going to spend

04:30.312 --> 04:32.481
five days following
stupid old Kiss around.

04:32.564 --> 04:33.649
It's painful.

04:33.732 --> 04:35.651
Not half as painful as a
tire iron upside your head.

04:35.776 --> 04:36.818
What?

04:36.902 --> 04:37.945
I'll miss you.

04:39.571 --> 04:41.240
Hey, Stewie, what do you want for lunch?

04:42.199 --> 04:43.367
STEWIE: "Dear stupid dog

04:43.450 --> 04:44.535
"I've gone to live

04:44.618 --> 04:45.619
"with the children on Jolly Farm.

04:45.702 --> 04:47.579
Good-bye forever, Stewie."

04:48.330 --> 04:50.791
"P.S. I never got a chance
to return that sweater

04:50.874 --> 04:52.417
"Lois gave me for Christmas.

04:52.835 --> 04:55.170
"I left the receipt on top of my bureau.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.172
"I'm probably over the 30-day return limit

04:57.256 --> 04:59.174
"but I'm sure if you make a fuss

04:59.258 --> 05:02.094
"they'll at least give you
a store credit or something.

05:02.553 --> 05:05.013
"It's actually not a horrible sweater.

05:05.097 --> 05:08.267
"It's just I can't imagine when
I'll ever wear it, you know?

05:08.851 --> 05:11.770
"Oh, and, uh, I also left
a button on the bureau.

05:11.854 --> 05:14.106
"I'm not sure what it goes to

05:14.189 --> 05:16.817
"but I can never bring myself
to throw a button away.

05:16.900 --> 05:19.403
"I know as soon as I do, I'll
find the garment it goes to

05:19.486 --> 05:21.196
"and then... and then it'll...

05:21.280 --> 05:23.907
"Wait a minute, actually, could
it have been from the sweater?

05:23.991 --> 05:26.618
"Did that sweater have buttons? Hmm.

05:26.702 --> 05:28.662
"Well, I should wrap this up
before I start to ramble.

05:29.121 --> 05:30.289
Again, good-bye forever."

05:31.039 --> 05:32.708
"P.P.S. You know what?

05:32.791 --> 05:34.418
"It might be a little chilly in London.

05:34.501 --> 05:35.836
"I-I'm actually going to take the sweater.

05:35.919 --> 05:37.212
Oh, my God!

05:40.966 --> 05:42.885
One of these planes must be
going to London.

05:44.219 --> 05:45.721
Queue up, children. Spit-spot.

05:45.804 --> 05:48.223
Here are the tickets, miss.
These are all ours. Thank you.

05:50.309 --> 05:53.228
Spit-spot, Albert Hall,
meat and two veg, Big Ben

05:53.312 --> 05:55.480
Dave Clark Five, Spam and eggs,
pip-pip, cheerio.

06:12.748 --> 06:13.749
Hot towel?

06:13.832 --> 06:15.584
Yes, thank you.

06:15.667 --> 06:17.211
Well, come on!

06:17.294 --> 06:18.629
What the hell are you doing here?

06:18.712 --> 06:20.172
I'm taking you off this plane.

06:20.255 --> 06:21.840
Well, think again, Rover.

06:25.552 --> 06:26.553
Great.

06:26.637 --> 06:29.264
I'm stuck on a transatlantic
flight with a petulant runaway.

06:29.348 --> 06:30.724
How could this get any worse?

06:30.807 --> 06:32.476
You know what I hate about flying?

06:32.559 --> 06:35.479
The peanuts-- first of all,
you can't get them open.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.981
Who are they trying
to keep out of these things?

06:38.065 --> 06:39.191
What's the deal

06:39.274 --> 06:40.859
with the razor blade slot in the bathroom?

06:40.943 --> 06:42.861
Are people actually shaving in there?

06:42.945 --> 06:45.113
Hi, Andy Dick here. Excuse me.

06:45.197 --> 06:47.491
I've got to get my bag
up in the overhead bin here...

06:47.574 --> 06:51.787
Oh! Whoa! No! No! Wow, that's wacky.

06:51.870 --> 06:53.330
( sighs )

06:58.168 --> 06:59.253
( beep )

06:59.336 --> 07:01.755
That wasn't so bad, was it?
Did you sleep at all?

07:01.839 --> 07:02.840
Yeah, a little.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.551
Ugh, I couldn't sleep a wink.
My pillow smelled like farts.

07:05.634 --> 07:07.135
That's all right,
because we're in England.

07:08.846 --> 07:09.847
Uh-oh.

07:12.641 --> 07:13.684
Well, I don't get it.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.269
Where are England's verdant fields,

07:15.352 --> 07:17.813
its rosy-rumped maidens
and bucktoothed solicitors?

07:17.896 --> 07:20.983
About 3,000 miles that way.
We're in the Middle East.

07:22.317 --> 07:23.402
Where are we going?

07:23.485 --> 07:24.570
I don't know, I'm not exactly familiar

07:24.653 --> 07:26.488
with this particular Arabian Village.

07:26.864 --> 07:28.031
VENDOR: Stuff for sale!

07:28.115 --> 07:30.033
Bad, cheaply made stuff for sale!

07:30.117 --> 07:31.994
Hey, Americans! You like movies?

07:32.077 --> 07:34.913
I've got "Dude, My Car
is Not Where I Parked It

07:34.997 --> 07:36.707
But Praise Allah, We Are Not Hurt."

07:36.790 --> 07:39.751
Camels for sale, this one
owned by little old man

07:39.835 --> 07:42.087
who only drove it to mosque on Sundays.

07:42.171 --> 07:44.047
Just had its knees replaced.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.883
Well, great, buy one,
and let's get out of here.

07:45.966 --> 07:46.967
What do you mean, buy one?

07:47.050 --> 07:48.051
All I've got is 50 bucks.

07:48.135 --> 07:49.303
We're going to have to distract them--

07:49.386 --> 07:50.721
follow my lead.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.973
( show tune begins )

07:53.182 --> 07:55.309
You and I are

07:55.392 --> 07:58.437
So awfully different

07:58.520 --> 08:01.273
Too awfully different

08:01.356 --> 08:03.400
To ever be pals

08:03.483 --> 08:05.319
-Do you want to go first?
-Yeah, I'll go.

08:05.402 --> 08:09.198
Your favorite hero is the Marquis de Sade

08:09.281 --> 08:10.699
Oh, you're one to talk.

08:10.782 --> 08:13.911
You get a stiffy from Phylicia Rashad

08:13.994 --> 08:14.995
Oh, one time.

08:15.078 --> 08:17.289
I've a style flair

08:17.372 --> 08:19.499
Just look at my hip hair

08:19.583 --> 08:21.084
Oh, yeah, that's quite a nice 'do there.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.211
Thanks.

08:22.294 --> 08:23.670
For me to poop on!

08:23.754 --> 08:25.589
-What?
-Come on, you look like Charlie Brown.

08:25.672 --> 08:26.673
Bite me, Snoopy.

08:26.757 --> 08:28.383
There's not a whole lot

08:28.467 --> 08:32.513
That we've got to agree on

08:32.596 --> 08:36.517
'Cause I love the strings
of a classical score

08:36.600 --> 08:40.812
And I like that singer
who looks like a whore

08:40.896 --> 08:42.314
-Ricky Martin?
-Love him.

08:42.397 --> 08:46.818
We're too different to ever be pals

08:46.902 --> 08:48.987
-You and I are
-Doo, doo, doo

08:49.071 --> 08:50.739
So awfully different

08:50.822 --> 08:51.823
Doo, doo, doo

08:51.907 --> 08:53.200
Too awfully different

08:53.283 --> 08:54.409
Doo, doo, doo

08:54.493 --> 08:55.953
To ever be pals

08:56.036 --> 08:58.413
Doo, doo, doo,doo, doo doo

08:58.497 --> 09:00.749
Your head's as massive

09:00.832 --> 09:02.084
As a meteorite

09:02.167 --> 09:03.502
STEWIE: Oh, very funny.

09:03.585 --> 09:07.422
You have a weenie like
a Christmas tree light

09:07.840 --> 09:10.342
I bet money

09:10.425 --> 09:13.095
You'll marry a honey

09:13.178 --> 09:15.514
Who's pretty and funny

09:15.597 --> 09:16.682
And her name will be Ted

09:16.807 --> 09:17.891
Oh, a gay joke.

09:17.975 --> 09:19.852
I just work with what you give me.

09:19.935 --> 09:21.728
You might think we're 'NSync

09:21.812 --> 09:22.813
But we stink...

09:22.896 --> 09:25.858
As a duo

09:25.941 --> 09:29.653
'Cause you get a kick out
of carnage and guts

09:29.736 --> 09:32.447
And you get a kick out of stroking your...

09:32.531 --> 09:33.782
Whoa, whoa, you can't say that on TV.

09:33.866 --> 09:35.200
-What, ego?
-Never mind.

09:35.284 --> 09:40.831
We're too different to ever be pals

09:42.583 --> 09:44.251
( music fades )

09:48.630 --> 09:51.550
Oh, man, we're screwed.
We're lost in the desert.

09:51.633 --> 09:53.051
We have no food, no water

09:53.135 --> 09:54.928
and our camel is dead from exhaustion.

09:55.012 --> 09:58.223
( sobbing ): And I had named him
and given him a back story.

09:58.307 --> 10:00.809
"Chucky had the biggest hump
of all the camels in his village

10:00.893 --> 10:01.935
"and he was picked on for it.

10:02.019 --> 10:03.687
"But then, there was a terrible drought

10:03.770 --> 10:05.898
"and Chucky went
to the oasis at great risk--

10:05.981 --> 10:06.982
"'cause he was like that--

10:07.065 --> 10:08.275
"and he drank and drank

10:08.358 --> 10:10.277
"and stored enough water
in his massive hump

10:10.360 --> 10:12.029
"to slake the thirst of the entire...

10:12.112 --> 10:14.323
Cut the maudlin crap,
we're in trouble here!

10:14.406 --> 10:16.408
It's already below freezing
and it's getting colder.

10:16.491 --> 10:19.578
We're going to die unless...
unless we do something drastic.

10:19.661 --> 10:20.787
What?

10:20.871 --> 10:22.706
We have to slice open our camel's stomach

10:22.789 --> 10:25.083
and shelter ourselves in his entrails.

10:25.167 --> 10:27.002
( gasps ):
Eviscerate Chucky? I won't do it!

10:27.085 --> 10:28.378
Look, we'll die if we don't.

10:28.462 --> 10:29.880
( sighs ): All right.

10:32.424 --> 10:35.802
Oh, God, it's like Orson Welles's autopsy!

10:35.886 --> 10:38.096
All right, just hold your breath and go.

10:38.180 --> 10:40.098
What are you doing?

10:40.182 --> 10:42.643
Wiping my feet, I don't want
to track any sand inside.

10:42.726 --> 10:44.645
Once you get it in there,
you can't get it out.

10:44.728 --> 10:46.230
( inhales )

10:46.313 --> 10:48.190
( gagging : Oh, God!

10:48.273 --> 10:50.150
Oh, God, I just threw up in his lung!

10:50.234 --> 10:52.486
Look, I know it's gross,
but when you're desperate

10:52.569 --> 10:54.154
and you're staring death in the face

10:54.238 --> 10:55.948
you have no other choice but to...

10:56.031 --> 10:57.032
Oh, there's a Comfort Inn.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.200
STEWIE: Really?

10:58.283 --> 10:59.618
Yeah, good luck for us, huh?

10:59.701 --> 11:01.620
You know, actually, once
you feng shui the organs

11:01.703 --> 11:02.704
it's kind of cozy.

11:08.460 --> 11:10.212
Oh, isn't this exciting?

11:10.295 --> 11:11.463
Hey, anyone got a light?

11:12.464 --> 11:13.507
Thanks.

11:13.590 --> 11:15.717
Peter, look, there's Dave
and Dottie, the nudists.

11:15.801 --> 11:17.636
Well, hey, there, Griffins.

11:17.719 --> 11:19.930
Dave, Dottie, what a pleasant surprise.

11:20.222 --> 11:22.140
Don't tell me you're Kiss freaks, too.

11:22.224 --> 11:25.102
Kiss Army soldier since 1977;
how about you?

11:25.185 --> 11:28.689
'76. I don't think anyone
knows more about Kiss than I do.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.649
I-I'm sorry, what was that?

11:30.732 --> 11:31.859
Peter, it's not important.

11:31.942 --> 11:32.943
Let him answer, Lois.

11:33.026 --> 11:36.071
I said no one knows more
about Kiss than I do.

11:36.154 --> 11:37.823
Fellas, please keep it civil.

11:37.906 --> 11:39.992
I'm not sure I
like the tone of your voice, Dave.

11:40.075 --> 11:42.077
Well, throw down if that's what you want.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.787
Name Gene Simmons' special effects mentor.

11:43.871 --> 11:44.872
Amazo the Magician.

11:44.955 --> 11:46.623
What high school did Paul Stanley go to?

11:46.707 --> 11:47.749
New York High School of Music.

11:47.833 --> 11:49.084
Paul and Gene's band before Kiss.

11:49.168 --> 11:50.169
Wicked Lester.

11:50.252 --> 11:52.254
What year did Kiss appear
on the Jim Nabors Halloween special?

11:52.337 --> 11:54.673
Trick question--
it was Paul Lynde, and it was 1975.

11:54.756 --> 11:56.133
Now, recite the magazine ad

11:56.216 --> 11:58.051
that brought Peter
Criss to Paul and Gene's attention.

11:58.260 --> 11:59.803
BOTH: "Drummer willing
to do anything to make it."

11:59.887 --> 12:02.014
Rolling Stone, October, 1972.

12:02.097 --> 12:03.807
-Exemplary!
-Rock 'n roll!

12:07.144 --> 12:09.188
How in the hell
are we going to get out of here?

12:09.271 --> 12:11.106
Are you going to finish your red paste?

12:11.190 --> 12:12.274
No.

12:12.357 --> 12:13.942
What about your sweet, crusty thing?

12:14.026 --> 12:15.027
No, you can have it.

12:15.152 --> 12:16.445
No more balloon for you!

12:16.528 --> 12:18.906
I am sick of you tooling around
the village in that thing

12:18.989 --> 12:20.157
honking at the girls

12:20.240 --> 12:22.242
blasting your 1980s American rock music

12:22.326 --> 12:23.619
that we got here last week.

12:23.702 --> 12:24.745
But, Father...

12:24.828 --> 12:26.038
Go to your palace!

12:26.121 --> 12:27.164
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

12:27.247 --> 12:28.582
Ugh, yes-- just wait

12:28.665 --> 12:30.876
until they have to suffer
through Jesus Jones.

12:30.959 --> 12:32.461
Pee-yew!

12:32.794 --> 12:33.962
Not that; the balloon.

12:34.046 --> 12:35.714
Oh, yes, the balloon. Let's take it.

12:37.966 --> 12:40.052
Wow. I didn't know
it really looked like that.

12:40.135 --> 12:41.470
Oh, neither did I.

12:41.970 --> 12:44.181
Such lovely printing, too.

12:44.264 --> 12:47.893
...Yeah, people shout it,
you people shout it...

12:48.185 --> 12:50.854
Oh, Lois, here comes the best part.

12:50.979 --> 12:56.985
I wanna rock and roll all night...

12:57.277 --> 13:00.072
And have a wonderful... time

13:00.155 --> 13:01.573
( mic feedback )

13:01.657 --> 13:02.699
Is that it?

13:02.783 --> 13:04.117
Oh, n-no, it's, uh...

13:04.201 --> 13:07.037
And something-something all... day

13:07.120 --> 13:08.330
Right?

13:08.413 --> 13:10.499
Oh, man, I've lost all faith in mankind.

13:10.582 --> 13:12.251
Music is dead to me now.

13:12.793 --> 13:14.044
Hey, now's our chance!

13:14.127 --> 13:15.254
Let's do it!

13:17.464 --> 13:19.091
Pardon me, boy

13:19.174 --> 13:21.760
Is that the Chattanooga choo-choo?

13:21.844 --> 13:23.929
Track 29

13:24.012 --> 13:26.348
And can you give me a shine?

13:27.266 --> 13:29.142
I say, where the hell are we?

13:31.603 --> 13:32.855
Pope? Pope!

13:32.938 --> 13:34.565
( groaning )

13:34.648 --> 13:37.150
It's-a time to get up and put on your hat.

13:37.234 --> 13:38.986
It's a stupid hat.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.153
Pope?!

13:40.237 --> 13:42.990
All right, okay. God!

13:43.115 --> 13:44.324
( flushing )

13:44.408 --> 13:46.535
Pope, the floor is not a hamper.

13:46.618 --> 13:48.203
Man!

13:48.287 --> 13:50.080
Good. Now it's-a time to go on the balcony

13:50.163 --> 13:51.373
and address-a the people.

13:51.456 --> 13:52.541
Il nome...

13:52.624 --> 13:54.293
Ah!!!

13:54.376 --> 13:57.004
( yelling )

14:00.299 --> 14:02.634
All right, all we got to do
is find the American Embassy

14:02.718 --> 14:03.719
and they'll help us get home.

14:03.802 --> 14:05.679
Home? I have no intention of returning

14:05.762 --> 14:08.432
to that disgusting hovel
with that intolerable woman

14:08.515 --> 14:10.726
that fat slob, and that insufferable dog.

14:10.809 --> 14:12.394
Oh, you're right here, aren't you?

14:12.477 --> 14:13.812
Oh, well, I stand by it.

14:13.896 --> 14:15.189
My future is with Jolly Farm.

14:15.272 --> 14:16.899
You really think that, don't you?

14:16.982 --> 14:18.317
I know it.

14:18.400 --> 14:19.401
Okay, we've got three days

14:19.484 --> 14:21.445
until Peter and Lois get back
from their Kiss concerts.

14:21.904 --> 14:22.905
Let's go to Jolly Farm.

14:22.988 --> 14:24.448
Now you're talking.

14:24.865 --> 14:27.034
You make-a the Pope look like a fool.

14:27.117 --> 14:28.702
God will make you pay.

14:28.785 --> 14:30.162
Smite them!

14:34.625 --> 14:36.502
He's a-cooking a-something up.

14:43.383 --> 14:44.760
I say, Brian, look-- three rows down.

14:44.843 --> 14:45.886
What?

14:45.969 --> 14:47.554
Is that Tom Bosley?

14:47.638 --> 14:49.056
What would Tom Bosley be doing

14:49.139 --> 14:50.641
on a train in Switzerland?

14:50.724 --> 14:52.559
I'm almost certain. Tom!

14:53.227 --> 14:54.353
Did he look?

14:54.436 --> 14:55.521
I don't know.

14:55.604 --> 14:57.356
Well, if I yell, you have to watch.

14:57.439 --> 14:58.649
Tom Bosley!

14:58.732 --> 14:59.733
No, it's not him.

14:59.816 --> 15:00.859
Huh.

15:02.778 --> 15:05.405
Besides its beautiful
historic architecture

15:05.656 --> 15:07.533
Munich was the home of many great writers

15:07.616 --> 15:09.076
such as Thomas Mann.

15:09.159 --> 15:11.787
You'll find more on Germany's
contribution to the arts

15:11.870 --> 15:13.580
in the pamphlets we have provided.

15:13.664 --> 15:15.040
Yeah, uh, about your pamphlet--

15:15.123 --> 15:18.126
um, I'm not seeing anything
about German history

15:18.210 --> 15:20.420
between 1939 and 1945.

15:20.504 --> 15:21.505
There's just a big gap.

15:21.588 --> 15:22.923
Everyone was on vacation!

15:23.006 --> 15:25.384
On your left is Munich's first city hall

15:25.467 --> 15:26.468
erected in 15...

15:26.552 --> 15:27.928
Wait, w-w-wait,
what are you talking about?

15:28.011 --> 15:30.013
Germany invaded Poland in 1939.

15:30.097 --> 15:31.181
We were invited!

15:31.265 --> 15:32.558
Punch was served! Check with Poland!

15:32.641 --> 15:34.268
You can't just ignore those years.

15:34.351 --> 15:35.727
Thomas Mann fled to America

15:35.811 --> 15:37.896
because of Nazism's
stranglehold on Germany.

15:38.021 --> 15:39.815
Nope. Nope.
He left to manage a Dairy Queen.

15:39.898 --> 15:41.859
A Dairy Queen? That's preposterous.

15:41.942 --> 15:44.278
I will hear no more insinuations
about the German people!

15:44.361 --> 15:45.571
Nothing bad happened!

15:45.654 --> 15:47.322
( yelling in Germanlike Hitler )

15:51.660 --> 15:53.579
Uh, i-is that a beer hall?

15:53.662 --> 15:56.498
Oh, yes. Munich is renowned
for its historic beer halls.

16:00.544 --> 16:02.004
Why is everybody glaring at us?

16:02.171 --> 16:03.213
Why, Lois?

16:03.297 --> 16:04.339
I'll tell you why.

16:04.423 --> 16:06.341
Your faux pas last night at the concert

16:06.425 --> 16:07.426
was so upsetting

16:07.509 --> 16:08.886
I had to call a university professor

16:08.969 --> 16:10.345
to tell me what phrase I could use

16:10.429 --> 16:11.430
to describe it.

16:11.513 --> 16:12.723
Use "faux pas."

16:12.806 --> 16:14.099
Thanks, Professor.

16:14.183 --> 16:16.143
You've been living a lie all these years.

16:16.226 --> 16:18.896
You represented yourself
as a Kiss fan, and why?

16:18.979 --> 16:20.439
To make me look foolish.

16:20.522 --> 16:21.899
No, to make you happy.

16:21.982 --> 16:25.110
I wanted to share in all
aspects of your life, Peter

16:25.277 --> 16:27.529
but I just was never that big a Kiss fan.

16:27.654 --> 16:28.655
Yeah, I should have guessed that

16:28.739 --> 16:30.908
when you were willing
to dress up as Peter Criss.

16:30.991 --> 16:33.785
No one wants to be Peter Criss,
Lois, not even Peter Criss.

16:34.244 --> 16:36.496
I guess I'm just not as
cool as you thought I was.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.498
I guess not.

16:42.503 --> 16:43.504
Oh, I'm exhausted.

16:43.587 --> 16:44.838
Let's get a coffee.

16:48.675 --> 16:49.885
( coughing)

16:49.968 --> 16:51.220
Ugh, this smoke is so acrid.

16:51.303 --> 16:52.971
Ugh, a man can hardly breathe in here.

16:53.096 --> 16:54.723
You should get some hash, man.

16:54.806 --> 16:55.974
You can't go wrong.

16:56.058 --> 16:57.476
Oh, not true.

16:57.559 --> 17:00.354
Ground meat can
go very wrong for me very quickly

17:00.437 --> 17:02.314
and everyone in
this room will suffer the consequences.

17:02.397 --> 17:05.025
You are out there, man-- in the ether.

17:05.108 --> 17:06.944
Yes, well, I'd love to
further pursue our palaver

17:07.027 --> 17:09.029
but I'm not fluent in Freaka

17:09.112 --> 17:11.907
so I'm just going to turn back over here--

17:11.990 --> 17:13.408
back towards my table.

17:13.492 --> 17:14.493
Say, are you hungry?

17:14.576 --> 17:15.577
I wasn't when I came in

17:15.661 --> 17:16.662
but isn't that so funny?

17:16.870 --> 17:17.871
I'm getting there.

17:17.955 --> 17:19.081
Yeah, same here.

17:22.584 --> 17:25.963
I think the only reason we die is that...

17:26.046 --> 17:27.339
Dude, dude

17:27.422 --> 17:29.007
I know what you're going to say

17:29.091 --> 17:30.592
and I am so completely...

17:30.676 --> 17:32.928
W-w-w-w-wait, wait, wait, ssh-ssh-ssh-ssh.

17:33.011 --> 17:35.472
The only reason we die

17:35.556 --> 17:41.562
is because we accept it
as an inevitability. Ah!

17:41.645 --> 17:43.564
Do you think I'll ever
find the right woman?

17:43.647 --> 17:45.649
Oh, God, I... yes, man!

17:45.816 --> 17:47.568
Come on, dude, you're great.

17:50.946 --> 17:53.156
Peter, are you ever going to forgive me?

17:53.240 --> 17:55.367
Lois, I am obligated to keep loving you

17:55.450 --> 17:57.578
so I will take my rage out on my own body.

17:57.661 --> 17:58.662
Let's go to Denny's.

18:01.164 --> 18:02.165
Oh, man

18:02.249 --> 18:04.084
I don't believe it! Kiss is here!

18:05.169 --> 18:07.379
We don't deserve
to be under the same roof with them.

18:07.462 --> 18:08.463
Let's go.

18:08.547 --> 18:09.590
Well, all right.

18:09.673 --> 18:12.259
I guess I could fix us something
when we... Chaim?

18:12.551 --> 18:15.929
Lois, do not address Kiss
unless they address you first!

18:16.346 --> 18:19.725
Oh, my God, Chaim Witz? It is you!

18:19.808 --> 18:22.186
Uh, which one do you want
me to sign, left or right?

18:22.269 --> 18:24.730
No, no, no, it's Lois--
Lois Pewterschmidt.

18:24.980 --> 18:27.232
I knew you before you changed your name.

18:27.733 --> 18:28.942
Lois! I don't believe it.

18:29.026 --> 18:30.319
It's been ages.

18:30.402 --> 18:32.362
Hey, guys, this is the girl
I told you about.

18:32.446 --> 18:34.031
You know, I knew her
before we formed Kiss.

18:34.114 --> 18:35.115
"Loose Lois."

18:35.199 --> 18:36.450
Cool-- Loose Lois!

18:36.533 --> 18:37.826
The legend herself!

18:37.910 --> 18:40.704
My Grand Slam was supposed to
be with sausage.

18:40.787 --> 18:41.997
I never realized

18:42.080 --> 18:44.416
you were Gene Simmons, the rock star.

18:44.499 --> 18:45.751
You look great, Lois.

18:45.834 --> 18:47.211
Anyone nailing you now?

18:47.294 --> 18:48.587
Yes, my husband nails me.

18:48.670 --> 18:50.130
This is him, Peter.

18:50.214 --> 18:53.258
You... are... gods!

18:53.342 --> 18:54.718
Yeah, thanks, right.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.512
Hey, we're recording some tracks
in Boston next month.

18:56.595 --> 18:58.055
You should come on by.

18:58.138 --> 19:02.184
We'd love that, Chaim,
I mean Gene, you big rock star.

19:02.267 --> 19:03.602
( chuckling ): Bye.

19:03.685 --> 19:06.396
Oh, wow, such a small world.

19:06.563 --> 19:07.731
He was a nice boy.

19:07.898 --> 19:09.191
And he's still nice.

19:09.274 --> 19:11.777
Listen, Lois, uh, what I said before...

19:11.860 --> 19:14.029
I've never been more wrong in my life.

19:14.112 --> 19:16.323
You are the coolest girl in the world.

19:16.406 --> 19:18.242
My wife did Kiss!

19:18.325 --> 19:19.535
And J. Geils.

19:19.618 --> 19:20.702
-What?
-Nothing.

19:20.786 --> 19:24.373
There it is-- the BBC.

19:27.793 --> 19:28.794
Well, this is it.

19:28.919 --> 19:30.295
I'll say good-bye to you now.

19:30.379 --> 19:31.755
Well, have a good life, Stewie.

19:31.839 --> 19:33.173
Mmm, I shall.

19:33.841 --> 19:35.050
Oh, hey, I meant to ask you.

19:35.133 --> 19:36.218
Did you ever find out

19:36.301 --> 19:38.178
what that button on my bureau was from?

19:38.262 --> 19:39.847
Oh, yeah, Chris's denim jacket.

19:39.930 --> 19:40.931
Ah. I like that jacket.

19:41.014 --> 19:42.307
It looks good on him.

19:42.391 --> 19:43.892
Okay, then, so, we'll keep in touch?

19:43.976 --> 19:45.060
Sure.

19:45.143 --> 19:46.144
Well, I have your address.

19:46.228 --> 19:47.229
See you.

19:48.397 --> 19:49.439
( gasping )

19:49.523 --> 19:51.149
Oh, there's Happy Hill!

19:51.233 --> 19:52.442
( grunting )

19:52.526 --> 19:53.861
What the deuce?

19:54.778 --> 19:56.154
( gasping )

19:56.238 --> 19:57.865
Pengrove! Pengrove Pig!

19:57.990 --> 20:00.826
Pengrove, I've come to live on Jolly Farm.

20:00.909 --> 20:02.578
Oh, my-- the Magic Tome!

20:03.120 --> 20:04.454
Well, it's, it's cardboard.

20:04.538 --> 20:05.956
A-and there are no words.

20:06.039 --> 20:07.958
There are just...
what is it you've drawn here?

20:08.041 --> 20:10.377
Oh, that's Oswald Owl
slammin' Mother Maggie

20:10.460 --> 20:12.462
in one of them Chinese baskets.

20:12.546 --> 20:14.631
( laughing )

20:14.715 --> 20:15.716
( yelling )

20:16.550 --> 20:18.093
Oh, Mother Maggie, thank God!

20:18.177 --> 20:19.469
Something's terribly wrong!

20:19.553 --> 20:20.971
( Cockney accent ):
Whose stinky brat is this?

20:21.054 --> 20:22.890
Oh... oh, that not your voice.

20:22.973 --> 20:25.559
Your voice is lyrical,
like the gentle strum of a lute.

20:25.642 --> 20:27.561
Piss off, you grotty little wanker!

20:28.937 --> 20:30.063
It's a fake.

20:30.189 --> 20:31.273
It's not real.

20:31.398 --> 20:32.399
I thought it would be best

20:32.482 --> 20:33.775
for you to find out on your own, kid.

20:33.859 --> 20:35.444
I feel like such a fool.

20:35.527 --> 20:36.612
Don't even look at me.

20:36.695 --> 20:39.781
Hey, come on.
You want to get some ice cream?

20:39.865 --> 20:41.366
That would make you feel better, right?

20:42.492 --> 20:43.869
You want to get some McDonald's?

20:45.621 --> 20:47.998
You want to take a dump
in Mother Maggie's shoes?

20:48.957 --> 20:51.668
Okay, let's go take a dump
in Mother Maggie's shoes.

20:55.714 --> 20:57.382
Jolly Farm is on, Stewie.

20:57.466 --> 20:58.467
Don't you want to watch?

20:58.550 --> 21:00.135
Oh, the Stewie who loved Jolly Farm

21:00.219 --> 21:01.637
is dead, Megan.

21:01.720 --> 21:03.931
Meet the Stewie
who loves funky fruit hats.

21:07.601 --> 21:08.602
Ooh, turn it up.

21:08.685 --> 21:09.811
Mom and Dad are on.

21:09.895 --> 21:11.688
Hey, we're back here with more Kiss Forum.

21:11.772 --> 21:13.023
I'm here with the Griffins

21:13.106 --> 21:14.775
and they got something
really exciting to share.

21:14.858 --> 21:16.527
Yeah, my wife here did Kiss.

21:16.610 --> 21:17.694
Get out of here!

21:17.778 --> 21:18.904
Hand to God.

21:18.987 --> 21:21.114
Whoa! Peter, how does that make you feel?

21:21.198 --> 21:23.575
I feel like I've done Kiss, too, Donny

21:23.659 --> 21:24.701
and it feels good.

21:24.785 --> 21:26.036
Lois, you got any tips

21:26.119 --> 21:28.330
for the young girls in
the audience tonight?

21:28.413 --> 21:30.332
Well, I guess the best advice I can give

21:30.415 --> 21:33.043
is that you never know who's
going to grow up to be famous

21:33.126 --> 21:34.586
so, just make yourself available.

21:34.670 --> 21:35.879
Cool, cool.

21:35.963 --> 21:38.173
Well, that's our show for tonight.

21:38.257 --> 21:40.843
Now, stay tuned
for Battlestar Galactica Forum.

21:41.260 --> 21:43.512
Welcome to Battlestar Galactica Forum.
