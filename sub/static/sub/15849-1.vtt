00:25.483 --> 00:26.817
Let me tell you something.

00:26.985 --> 00:30.446
The SCLC has direct Communist ties.

00:30.613 --> 00:33.282
Even great men can be corrupted,
can't they?

00:33.450 --> 00:36.994
Communism is not a political party.
Lt is a disease.

00:37.162 --> 00:39.788
Lt corrupts the soul,
turning even the gentlest of men...

00:39.956 --> 00:43.167
into vicious, evil tyrants.

00:43.334 --> 00:46.754
What we are seeing is a pervasive
contempt for law and order.

00:46.921 --> 00:48.005
Crime rates are soaring.

00:48.173 --> 00:50.883
There's widespread,
open defiance of our authority...

00:51.051 --> 00:53.552
and, mark my words,
if this goes unchecked...

00:53.720 --> 00:58.307
it will once again plunge our nation
into the depths of anarchy.

00:58.475 --> 01:01.310
Lt all starts out peacefully,
doesn't it, Mr. Irwin?

01:01.478 --> 01:03.020
You have to live with the fact...

01:03.188 --> 01:06.106
that you could've helped prevent
the bombings and the violence.

01:06.274 --> 01:08.817
I'm more interested in what this says
about your FBI.

01:08.985 --> 01:11.361
I have worked too long and hard
to just sit back...

01:11.529 --> 01:15.324
and watch the bad guys capture
the spotlight again, haven't I?

01:15.492 --> 01:17.201
The funny thing about notoriety...

01:17.368 --> 01:21.830
especially the kind that needs
adoration, fame for fame's sake...

01:21.998 --> 01:24.249
if unchecked,
it inevitably leads to villainy.

01:24.417 --> 01:27.669
I suggest you look at what this
squabble is really about...

01:27.837 --> 01:31.673
before you destroy the reputation
of the thing we both know you love most.

01:46.356 --> 01:48.982
Sir, the
writer's here from Crime Records...

01:49.150 --> 01:50.192
the PR Department.

01:50.360 --> 01:53.362
Set him up with a typewriter
in my outer office.

01:53.530 --> 01:56.990
Miss Gandy, it's time this generation
learn my side of the story.

01:57.158 --> 01:59.201
Right away.
- Thank you.

02:00.745 --> 02:03.080
In 1919, Agent Smith...

02:03.248 --> 02:05.707
my first boss here
at the Department of Justice...

02:05.875 --> 02:08.919
was Attorney General
A. Mitchell Palmer.

02:09.086 --> 02:10.253
He was a Quaker.

02:10.420 --> 02:15.384
He didn't believe in war, but he understood
the necessity of strength and resolve.

02:15.552 --> 02:17.386
Believe what you will from historians...

02:17.554 --> 02:21.473
most write from a present perspective,
forgetting context.

02:21.641 --> 02:24.726
Mitchell Palmer was a hero.

02:57.093 --> 02:58.927
- Are you all right?
- Unh.

02:59.095 --> 03:01.180
- Are you all right?
- Yes. I think. Yes.

03:19.115 --> 03:22.284
Lt's all right. Come here.

03:22.452 --> 03:25.954
- lt's all right, it's all right.
- No, it's okay.

03:26.122 --> 03:28.916
Are you okay? lt's okay.

03:32.837 --> 03:34.755
Are you okay?

03:59.781 --> 04:02.991
You see,
Palmer fought the radicals, just as I have.

04:03.159 --> 04:07.621
And just as I have, he was targeted.
He wasn't alone.

04:07.789 --> 04:12.668
Across the country that night,
eight bombs exploded, all at 11 p.m.

04:12.835 --> 04:14.336
Two United States senators...

04:14.504 --> 04:17.005
four cabinet members,
a Supreme Court justice...

04:17.173 --> 04:19.298
John D. Rockefeller, J.P. Morgan...

04:20.009 --> 04:23.345
all of them targeted
by Bolshevik Communists.

04:23.513 --> 04:25.681
Yeah, it shook the whole thing.

04:29.686 --> 04:32.562
It was clear to me
the radicals bomb went off too soon...

04:32.730 --> 04:35.524
leaving only his blood in the street.

04:35.692 --> 04:40.320
But the inspectors used buckets to
clean up the mess instead of collecting it.

04:40.488 --> 04:43.865
They discarded his gun
instead of preserving its prints.

04:44.033 --> 04:46.201
But you see,
this wasn't clumsy police work.

04:46.369 --> 04:49.496
In those times, it was normal procedure.

04:49.664 --> 04:52.958
This may be the end of days
for this country, Dwight.

04:57.380 --> 05:01.550
lt was 1919, before anyone
respected criminal science...

05:01.718 --> 05:04.720
before federal powers, before the FBI.

05:05.555 --> 05:10.475
It was that night my eyes were opened.
That very night.

05:11.227 --> 05:12.769
Ls he a neighbor, sir?

05:13.271 --> 05:15.188
No. He works in my office.

05:17.358 --> 05:21.903
"There will have to be murder.
We will kill because it is necessary.

05:22.071 --> 05:25.866
We will destroy to rid the world
of your tyrannical institutions."

05:34.250 --> 05:36.710
You were at Attorney General
Palmer's home that night?

05:36.878 --> 05:39.463
Well, let's leave that
to the reader's imagination.

05:39.672 --> 05:43.550
You see, it's important we give
our protagonist a bit of mystery.

05:43.760 --> 05:46.720
I could allude to a young man
who matches your description.

05:46.888 --> 05:48.347
The best of both worlds.

05:48.514 --> 05:50.724
Where did you get your law degree?

05:50.892 --> 05:53.060
George Washington. I grew up here.

05:53.227 --> 05:55.520
I had a mom to take care of,
so I stayed close.

05:55.688 --> 05:57.939
I received an English degree there also.

05:58.775 --> 06:02.944
Then I don't need to tell you that
what determines a man's legacy...

06:03.112 --> 06:05.405
is often what isn't seen.

06:05.698 --> 06:07.991
What's critical at this moment is...

06:08.201 --> 06:12.454
that we re-clarify the difference
between villain and hero.

06:13.956 --> 06:16.625
How do you think that compares
with today?

06:17.627 --> 06:20.420
I'm not sure, sir. I'd like to hear more.

06:20.588 --> 06:22.589
I could come back tomorrow.

06:23.299 --> 06:26.593
Fine. But the pages stay here.

06:26.761 --> 06:28.095
Of course, sir.

06:29.972 --> 06:31.139
Agent Smith.

06:31.307 --> 06:32.391
Thank you, sir.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.776
Never a good idea to talk too loud.

06:49.325 --> 06:50.617
Good morning, John.

06:50.785 --> 06:53.870
Mr. Palmer has asked that you attend
the emergency meeting today.

06:54.038 --> 06:55.580
Miss Gladwell, please remember...

06:56.916 --> 06:58.417
it's Mr. Hoover.

06:58.584 --> 07:00.502
Two o'clock.

07:00.670 --> 07:04.339
Don't be too early this time.
Lt's as rude as being tardy.

07:05.174 --> 07:08.760
And who is this lovely addition
to the secretarial pool?

07:11.806 --> 07:13.849
Helen, introduce yourself.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.142
Oh.

07:15.309 --> 07:18.145
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Hoover.
I'm Helen Gandy.

07:18.312 --> 07:21.356
Pleased to meet you.
Welcome to the Department of Justice.

07:22.859 --> 07:25.444
You can notify Mr. Palmer
that I will attend.

07:26.195 --> 07:27.654
Of course.

07:30.366 --> 07:33.410
He's always a charmer.
I wouldn't take anything very seriously.

07:42.712 --> 07:44.504
Jeremy, I need your help.

07:44.672 --> 07:46.339
I need, uh... Uh, help.

07:46.507 --> 07:47.966
I need your help.

08:06.194 --> 08:07.360
Good evening, Mother.

08:11.073 --> 08:12.240
Edgar.

08:14.076 --> 08:16.912
Madame Marcia held court this morning.

08:17.538 --> 08:20.248
I should buy a dress.

08:21.250 --> 08:23.752
She says your father will die soon.

08:24.670 --> 08:29.591
And when he does, you will rise to be
the most powerful man in the country.

08:33.471 --> 08:35.764
Your brother's a good man, Edgar...

08:35.932 --> 08:39.433
but you will restore our family
to greatness.

08:42.730 --> 08:43.772
Edgar?

08:43.940 --> 08:46.441
Edgar? Am I boring you?

08:46.609 --> 08:49.277
I'm listening, Mother. You fired the maid.

08:50.112 --> 08:52.322
I told her when she was through,
she could quit.

08:52.490 --> 08:56.952
I'm not paying for her impudence.
The whole Negro race is in open revolt.

08:57.119 --> 08:59.287
- I could open an investigation.
- Gotten too comfortable.

08:59.455 --> 09:02.415
Did you hear what I said?
I said I could open an investigation.

09:02.583 --> 09:03.708
Say what you mean.

09:04.293 --> 09:08.255
Mr. Palmer called me into a meeting today.
The war against the Bolsheviks has begun.

09:08.422 --> 09:11.633
He's insisted that I lead
a new anti-radical division.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.301
Did you leap like a dog?

09:14.011 --> 09:17.138
I told him this is the greatest
threat our nation has ever faced...

09:17.306 --> 09:21.142
and I cannot take the job unless
I feel certain I can be effective.

09:21.310 --> 09:23.770
Well done. But you'll take it.

09:23.938 --> 09:25.814
Three thousand a year, Mother.

09:25.982 --> 09:28.984
I've got to get new clothes.
You can't look like that anymore.

09:31.237 --> 09:34.781
I have 40 names of suspected radicals
already in only four hours.

09:34.949 --> 09:36.825
I should have 10,000
by end of the month.

09:36.993 --> 09:41.788
And I have my own staff, trusted agents.

09:41.956 --> 09:44.499
Edgar, are you smoking?

09:45.293 --> 09:48.670
- Doesn't come naturally, Mother.
- Listen to the doctor.

09:48.838 --> 09:52.299
With this new burden,
your nerves could get the better of you.

09:56.012 --> 09:57.971
You don't want to end up like your father.

09:58.139 --> 10:00.682
Go and try one now.
You can put your father in his room.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.350
I have to get ready for dinner.

10:04.687 --> 10:06.438
Are you abandoning me tonight?

10:07.648 --> 10:10.025
Lt's with a typist. She's very organized.

10:11.402 --> 10:12.444
Ls it a date?

10:12.612 --> 10:14.654
I think so. I think so.

10:14.822 --> 10:19.200
I'm gonna show her my old card catalog
system at the Library of Congress.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.244
Romance her.

10:22.038 --> 10:23.622
Wear a blue tie.

10:24.582 --> 10:26.958
You look so handsome in your blue tie.

10:37.720 --> 10:38.720
Look at the ceiling.

10:38.888 --> 10:40.388
Lt's incredible.

10:44.727 --> 10:47.520
I've never been here before.

10:54.987 --> 10:56.363
I helped organize it.

10:56.530 --> 10:59.074
See, every item is assigned
its own index card...

10:59.241 --> 11:00.992
with its own unique code...

11:01.160 --> 11:05.121
indicating the title, author,
location, and topic.

11:05.289 --> 11:09.668
What used to take days to locate
now only takes a matter of minutes.

11:09.835 --> 11:13.171
Go on. Give me an author
or a topic. Anything.

11:14.173 --> 11:15.215
Indiscretion.

11:15.383 --> 11:16.591
What era?

11:16.842 --> 11:17.884
Present day.

11:18.052 --> 11:20.512
Good. Time me.

11:47.164 --> 11:48.623
Hmm.

11:51.961 --> 11:53.503
Heh.

11:55.506 --> 11:57.966
Almost there, heh.

12:02.179 --> 12:04.806
How do you know I didn't mean
political indiscretion?

12:05.683 --> 12:08.268
Well, if you'd like,
I can start all over again.

12:08.436 --> 12:09.602
This will do.

12:09.770 --> 12:11.479
How long did I take?

12:11.647 --> 12:13.815
One minute, 10 seconds.

12:13.983 --> 12:17.610
Now imagine if every citizen in this
country were uniquely identifiable...

12:17.778 --> 12:21.990
by their own card and number,
say, the pattern on their fingers.

12:22.992 --> 12:27.036
Imagine how quickly we could find them
if they committed a crime.

12:27.496 --> 12:29.330
Lt's all very impressive, John.

12:30.666 --> 12:34.919
Well, would you like to stay here
or would you like to go somewhere else?

12:35.796 --> 12:37.213
Lt's up to you.

12:41.886 --> 12:42.927
Mr. Hoover.

12:45.514 --> 12:48.016
I'm not sure where you think
this is headed.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.185
Right, of course.

12:52.688 --> 12:53.980
Miss Gandy.

12:56.734 --> 12:59.027
I know we've only known each other
a brief time...

12:59.195 --> 13:01.529
but you would
make the finest of companions.

13:01.697 --> 13:05.158
Your strength, your character,
your education.

13:05.326 --> 13:07.285
Are you poking fun at me?

13:07.953 --> 13:10.789
No. No, no, no. No, no, of course not.

13:11.749 --> 13:14.209
Then please, Mr. Hoover, stand up.

13:18.130 --> 13:21.716
I'd appreciate it
if you wouldn't share this...

13:21.884 --> 13:24.886
with any of the other women
in the typing pool.

13:25.054 --> 13:26.554
No, of course not.

13:26.722 --> 13:29.224
All right. May I ask what... What...

13:30.142 --> 13:33.728
What particular flaw
you seem to find in my character?

13:34.438 --> 13:36.397
No. We just met.

13:36.565 --> 13:37.732
Right, of course.

13:37.900 --> 13:40.902
But I believe that I am a fast
and accurate judge of character.

13:41.070 --> 13:43.404
We've gone out three times,
but I don't need more.

13:43.572 --> 13:47.033
Most people do, but I don't.
I see people right off for what they are.

13:47.201 --> 13:50.578
And please, call me Edgar.
Lt's what my mother uses.

13:50.746 --> 13:52.664
- Edgar?
- Yes?

13:52.832 --> 13:55.083
Can you keep a secret?

13:55.876 --> 13:58.753
Yes. Of course. You have my word.

14:00.422 --> 14:04.926
I'm not interested in getting married.
My work comes first.

14:06.136 --> 14:07.637
Hmm.

14:08.889 --> 14:14.435
Then perhaps you would consider
a position as my personal secretary.

14:20.401 --> 14:21.442
Yes.

14:22.444 --> 14:23.778
Shall we?

14:24.697 --> 14:26.155
The book.

14:26.323 --> 14:27.949
Right.

14:29.618 --> 14:30.910
After you.

14:31.287 --> 14:35.623
I helped organize that library
just as I did this Bureau.

14:35.791 --> 14:38.126
And many said we didn't need either.

14:38.294 --> 14:41.588
You see, innovators
aren't often celebrated.

14:42.131 --> 14:43.798
Not at first.

14:52.808 --> 14:56.728
Miss Gandy.

14:58.939 --> 15:01.649
The nitwit Kennedy child
rang his baby buzzer again.

15:01.817 --> 15:03.401
Perhaps he'd like a fresh diaper.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.945
Should I find out what
the Attorney General needs?

15:06.113 --> 15:09.824
No, I want the completed transcripts
of the Los Angeles recordings.

15:09.992 --> 15:12.827
When I receive those,
then we'll answer his buzzer.

15:12.995 --> 15:14.746
Very good.

15:15.205 --> 15:17.665
Edgar, Agent Smith is back.

15:17.833 --> 15:20.919
He, uh, has some questions
about the Palmer Raids.

15:21.086 --> 15:23.338
Should I tell him to go?

15:24.506 --> 15:26.674
Helen, do you like him?

15:26.842 --> 15:29.177
I don't have an opinion of him yet.

15:29.720 --> 15:31.304
Hmm.

15:31.472 --> 15:33.932
Well, I like him. I trust him.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.852
- I'll set him up in your outer office.
- No. No, no, no.

15:38.020 --> 15:40.313
Bring him a desk in here.

15:42.775 --> 15:45.652
But in 1920,
how could I protect us from anyone?

15:45.819 --> 15:48.738
Before I moved to this office,
we were powerless.

15:48.906 --> 15:51.658
We had few federal laws,
no right to carry firearms...

15:51.825 --> 15:53.993
and Congress liked it that way.

15:54.161 --> 15:58.414
Criminals ran free, but there was no law
against keeping track of them...

15:58.582 --> 16:00.750
so I made a decision on my own.

16:00.918 --> 16:03.461
I compiled note cards
and over five thousand names...

16:03.629 --> 16:05.880
and called the one department
in Washington...

16:06.048 --> 16:08.716
that still held a small piece
of untested power.

16:08.884 --> 16:12.553
Was that the Department of Labor?
The power to deport, sir?

16:12.721 --> 16:15.264
But only to deport those
who checked two boxes.

16:15.432 --> 16:20.269
They had to be foreign citizens and they
had to be working to harm our country.

16:20.437 --> 16:22.188
And they cooperated with you?

16:22.356 --> 16:23.982
Of course not.

16:24.149 --> 16:28.319
No one freely shares power
in Washington, D.C., Agent Smith.

16:28.487 --> 16:31.239
There is no law
under which you can issue a warrant...

16:31.407 --> 16:33.241
for the arrest of an alien...

16:33.409 --> 16:36.077
when I have certified that
he is subject to deportation?

16:36.245 --> 16:38.997
Without any evidence,
Mr. Attorney General, no.

16:39.164 --> 16:41.749
- There exists a due process of law.
- Due process of law?

16:43.168 --> 16:45.712
- What about the threat?
- There might be a threat...

16:45.879 --> 16:47.005
Might be?

16:47.172 --> 16:49.882
Fine. There is a threat to our country.

16:50.050 --> 16:53.469
But with no proof of a crime,
there's no cause for deportation.

16:53.637 --> 16:55.596
We'll see about that.

16:55.764 --> 16:57.598
You'll be hearing from me.

16:59.435 --> 17:01.936
But one of their heads was a Mr. Caminetti.

17:02.104 --> 17:06.858
He was weary of our Justice Department,
but he hated one person even more.

17:07.026 --> 17:10.194
I am a revolutionist by nature...

17:10.362 --> 17:11.445
and as such...

17:11.613 --> 17:15.782
I claim the right to rebel
and resist invasion...

17:15.951 --> 17:19.454
by all means, force included.

17:19.621 --> 17:22.915
Emma Goldman. She was the hero
of the radical movement.

17:23.083 --> 17:27.587
If I could hand Caminetti Emma Goldman,
he would deport her without a thought.

17:27.755 --> 17:30.089
But she was a citizen.

17:33.635 --> 17:34.969
Would you like to stop, sir?

17:39.058 --> 17:40.558
No.

17:40.726 --> 17:44.228
I know it's hard for you to imagine today,
but there was a time...

17:44.396 --> 17:49.358
when the average American feared
for their safety and survival, Agent Smith.

17:49.902 --> 17:54.864
In Chicago, a coal strike started
by communist labor shut off all the power.

17:55.032 --> 17:56.324
Riots followed.

17:56.492 --> 17:59.160
And on Armistice Day
in Centralia, Washington...

17:59.328 --> 18:02.830
veterans fresh back from the war
were murdered by radicals.

18:04.208 --> 18:07.752
The red revolution had arrived on our soil.

18:14.426 --> 18:16.511
No, no. We can't take them down
one by one.

18:16.678 --> 18:20.556
They'll go underground and we'll have
a bomb inside every senator's mailbox.

18:20.724 --> 18:23.851
We need to have a simultaneous raid,
hitting all of them at once.

18:24.019 --> 18:26.145
- Who are "they"?
- You're here to find out.

18:26.313 --> 18:30.066
Now listen, I want a card on every
radical person in this country.

18:30.234 --> 18:31.984
Against the wall, gentlemen.

18:32.152 --> 18:35.321
I wanna know who, where they're from,
what group, what they say.

18:35.489 --> 18:37.073
Who have already committed crimes?

18:37.241 --> 18:41.786
I care more whether they intend to.
Against the wall, gentlemen, thank you.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.705
- How many are on our team?
- Only you four for now.

18:44.873 --> 18:46.666
I'll have locks installed.

18:46.834 --> 18:49.544
No, Miss Gandy.
That would bring too much attention.

18:49.711 --> 18:51.712
Nothing is to be alphabetically ordered.

18:51.880 --> 18:54.799
I want the cards to be broken down
into subjects and categories.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.385
Now, this system should be easy enough
if explained.

18:57.553 --> 19:00.513
If not, finding information
should prove impossible.

19:02.307 --> 19:05.393
And trust no one,
not even our fellow agents.

19:05.561 --> 19:08.062
Half our colleagues are on both sides
of the payroll.

19:08.564 --> 19:11.524
But the crimes we're investigating
aren't crimes, they're ideas.

19:11.692 --> 19:12.984
Well, if your idea...

19:13.152 --> 19:15.319
Against the wall, gentlemen. Thank you.

19:15.487 --> 19:19.574
If your idea is to come into our country
and plot the overthrow of our government...

19:19.741 --> 19:21.534
then, yes, indeed, that is a crime.

19:21.702 --> 19:24.162
Mrs. Goldman married a U.S. citizen.

19:25.080 --> 19:28.583
The man she married hasn't visited
her once in prison, yet this man...

19:28.750 --> 19:31.752
the man she's lived with since her
wedding, he visits nightly.

19:31.920 --> 19:34.964
What happens when we raid this
list of yours and find nothing?

19:35.132 --> 19:38.467
No guns, no bombs,
just innocent people deported.

19:38.635 --> 19:41.762
From every corner of this nation,
the American people...

19:41.930 --> 19:45.016
have urged the Attorney General
to do something about this...

19:45.184 --> 19:47.351
and return the United States
back to peace.

19:47.519 --> 19:50.438
Now, I'm happy to send your objections
to Mr. Palmer himself...

19:50.606 --> 19:53.691
but, in the meantime,
expose Miss Goldman's sham marriage...

19:53.859 --> 19:57.111
and you will change that suit of yours.

19:57.279 --> 19:59.363
- Pardon me, John?
- Your suit, sir, your suit.

19:59.531 --> 20:00.573
This isn't a saloon.

20:00.741 --> 20:03.117
Have respect for yourself,
but, more importantly...

20:03.285 --> 20:04.952
have respect for this department.

20:05.120 --> 20:06.746
Miss Gandy?

20:13.712 --> 20:15.463
Miss Goldman, are you an anarchist?

20:15.631 --> 20:17.048
I decline to answer.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.300
Do you deny that you are an anarchist?

20:19.468 --> 20:21.469
I decline to answer.

20:21.637 --> 20:25.223
Do you believe in the overthrow
of the government of the United States?

20:25.390 --> 20:26.891
I refuse to answer.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.560
Do you advocate the assassination
of public officials?

20:29.728 --> 20:32.480
I refuse to answer.

20:34.775 --> 20:39.820
This alien has refused to answer questions
pertaining to the charges in the warrant...

20:39.988 --> 20:43.241
notwithstanding the fact that
every opportunity was afforded her.

20:43.408 --> 20:45.117
I recommend deportation.

20:47.621 --> 20:50.998
And just like that, we had our precedent.

20:53.001 --> 20:57.505
Edgar, should I arrange our travel
to Paterson on Valentine's Day?

20:58.173 --> 21:00.675
Yes, of course, Miss Gandy.

21:05.180 --> 21:09.475
I took the train to Paterson,
New Jersey, on February 14th.

21:09.643 --> 21:11.894
If I could catch these
radicals red-handed...

21:12.062 --> 21:15.731
then the Labor Department would have
to put them all on boats back home.

21:15.899 --> 21:18.442
So agents of the Bureau,
alongside local police...

21:18.610 --> 21:22.405
began raiding gathering places
of known communist radicals...

21:22.864 --> 21:25.199
all across this country.

21:26.868 --> 21:28.661
These people are armed and violent.

21:28.829 --> 21:31.539
They're prepared to kill to avoid capture.

21:32.624 --> 21:34.166
Take one. Go on.

21:34.710 --> 21:37.128
- Are we allowed to use these, sir?
- These are gifts.

21:37.296 --> 21:40.047
There is no law that prevents us
from using our own weapons.

21:40.215 --> 21:42.883
Gentlemen, grab your guns.

21:45.721 --> 21:47.388
Gentlemen, quickly.

21:51.393 --> 21:52.727
Let's move.

22:04.906 --> 22:06.532
Police! This is a raid!

22:16.460 --> 22:19.253
He's going for the window, stop him!

22:51.328 --> 22:52.703
That's enough!

23:12.849 --> 23:15.851
The leaflets matched exactly.

23:16.186 --> 23:18.771
We'd solved the bombings.

23:19.022 --> 23:23.401
And, in the end, we arrested nearly
4000 communist radicals...

23:23.568 --> 23:25.820
and deported over 500 of them.

23:27.155 --> 23:31.617
Lt was accomplished against great odds
and at great personal peril.

23:34.287 --> 23:39.375
They found the counterfeiting press,
five pistols, two automatics.

23:39.543 --> 23:43.921
And in Trenton, they found gunpowder,
copper, brass wire, and batteries.

23:44.089 --> 23:46.340
- A bomb factory.
- Yes.

23:46.508 --> 23:52.847
One hundred and twenty arrests in Detroit,
41 in Philadelphia, and 17 here so far.

23:53.014 --> 23:56.142
But everyone in the Bureau involved
lost their job, correct?

23:56.309 --> 23:57.685
Even Palmer himself?

23:57.853 --> 23:59.979
Some did, and there's the lesson.

24:00.147 --> 24:02.648
You see, the bombs stopped,
and peace came.

24:02.816 --> 24:05.860
The American people had forgotten
there ever was a threat.

24:06.027 --> 24:08.863
So when political adversaries
attacked Palmer...

24:09.030 --> 24:11.699
for trying to protect this nation
from communism...

24:11.867 --> 24:13.701
our countrymen allowed it to happen.

24:14.661 --> 24:19.582
Because like today, they've forgotten
the bombs, the blood, the fear.

24:19.749 --> 24:22.460
But why Palmer and not you,
if you orchestrated the raids?

24:23.920 --> 24:28.340
I was 24 years old, Agent Smith.
I was just following orders.

24:28.508 --> 24:29.925
I understand, sir.

24:30.093 --> 24:34.346
And if we hadn't, you may very well
have been born into a communist state...

24:34.514 --> 24:37.224
rather than the country you love today.

24:37.392 --> 24:39.310
- Am I right?
- Of course, sir.

24:39.478 --> 24:40.519
Hmm.

24:40.687 --> 24:41.729
Edgar?

24:43.148 --> 24:44.190
Ignore him.

24:44.858 --> 24:45.900
Edgar?

24:46.610 --> 24:49.904
I am in a meeting, Mr. Tolson.
I'll be out in a moment.

24:50.071 --> 24:53.407
Don't forget about your appointment
with the Attorney General, Edgar.

24:53.575 --> 24:58.037
Files are not yet completed, Mr. Tolson.
Please go away.

24:58.914 --> 25:00.664
Thank you.

25:02.918 --> 25:07.087
Thank you, sir. I apologize.
I'll finish this chapter tonight.

25:09.049 --> 25:10.925
Very well, Agent Smith.

25:20.101 --> 25:23.604
In the Academy, do they tell the story
of how I got here?

25:23.772 --> 25:26.982
Yes, sir. Uh, you were called into
the new Attorney General's office...

25:27.150 --> 25:30.277
- Harlan Fiske Stone.
- Yes, sir, Attorney General Stone.

25:30.445 --> 25:33.239
He called you into his office
and told you to sit down, sir.

25:33.406 --> 25:35.824
Sir, there are over a dozen vacancies
in Chicago.

25:35.992 --> 25:39.036
And with the robbery rates rising,
it would profit the Bureau...

25:39.204 --> 25:41.455
to start filling vacancies
and make recoveries.

25:41.623 --> 25:46.001
I have files on potential suspects,
and with a congressional hearing...

25:46.169 --> 25:50.631
Lower the treble, son. You didn't call
this meeting, I did. Sit down.

25:51.633 --> 25:52.758
Yes, sir.

25:53.635 --> 25:57.846
Everyone you've worked with here is gone.
And there's a reason for that.

25:58.014 --> 26:03.143
This Bureau is of exceedingly bad odor.
Would you agree?

26:04.020 --> 26:05.312
Yes, sir.

26:06.106 --> 26:08.399
And, no offense,
you seem to have no social life.

26:08.567 --> 26:13.821
No wife, no girlfriend.
As far as I can tell, no pals at all.

26:16.533 --> 26:18.075
That is accurate, sir.

26:18.243 --> 26:22.413
And you're shamelessly distracted
by this hodgepodge fingerprinting affair.

26:22.581 --> 26:27.501
Sir, it wouldn't be hodgepodge if we could
centralize the prints here, I assure you.

26:27.669 --> 26:29.837
Lt's a speculative science at best.

26:31.423 --> 26:32.673
Yes, sir.

26:33.258 --> 26:35.009
And why do they call you Speed?

26:36.386 --> 26:37.428
Who calls me that?

26:37.596 --> 26:40.472
They all do, behind your back, evidently.

26:43.184 --> 26:47.187
I gained a reputation for delivering
groceries when I was 10 years old.

26:47.355 --> 26:51.108
I was the fastest in the neighborhood.
Lt was just a nickname.

26:51.276 --> 26:53.110
You sure it's not for the way you talk?

26:55.155 --> 26:56.864
Perhaps, sir.

26:57.824 --> 27:04.204
Young man, I want you to be acting
director of the Bureau of Investigation.

27:07.083 --> 27:11.670
I will take the job, Mr. Stone,
but only on certain conditions.

27:13.590 --> 27:15.007
What are they?

27:16.259 --> 27:21.013
The Bureau must be divorced from politics
and not be a catchall for political hacks.

27:21.890 --> 27:25.059
Recruits must be college-educated.

27:25.352 --> 27:28.062
Appointments must be based on merit.

27:28.229 --> 27:32.066
Promotions will be made on proven ability.

27:32.484 --> 27:36.403
And, well, the Bureau will be
responsible only to you, sir...

27:36.571 --> 27:38.072
the Attorney General.

27:41.034 --> 27:44.912
I wouldn't give you the job
under any other conditions.

27:46.706 --> 27:48.874
That's all. Good day.

27:51.544 --> 27:52.711
Well, thank you, sir.

27:52.879 --> 27:56.924
I am determined to summarily dismiss
from this Bureau...

27:57.092 --> 28:00.844
any employee whom I find
indulging in the use of intoxicants.

28:01.012 --> 28:04.765
Lt is my belief that when a man
becomes a part of this Bureau...

28:04.933 --> 28:10.104
he must so conduct himself,
both officially and unofficially...

28:10.271 --> 28:13.774
as to eliminate even
the slightest possibility of criticism...

28:13.942 --> 28:15.943
as to his conduct.

28:18.154 --> 28:20.948
- And what is your name, sir?
- Agent Williams, sir.

28:21.116 --> 28:23.575
- Pleasure to meet you, Agent Williams.
- You too, sir.

28:25.954 --> 28:27.079
And your name?

28:27.247 --> 28:28.789
Agent Caffrey, sir.

28:28.957 --> 28:31.291
- Your assignment?
- I'm headed to Kansas City...

28:31.459 --> 28:34.253
to aid in the search
for bank robber Frank Nash, sir.

28:34.421 --> 28:36.505
Mm, that is dangerous work,
and when you return...

28:36.673 --> 28:39.049
you will be rewarded for your service.

28:43.972 --> 28:47.933
You still fancy facial hair, Agent Stokes?

28:48.184 --> 28:50.686
- The ladies appreciate it.
- Hmm.

28:50.854 --> 28:54.189
And I suppose the ladies' opinions
are more important than the Bureau's?

28:54.357 --> 28:55.399
No.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.067
Sir.

28:57.819 --> 29:00.279
Perhaps you are better suited
for the police force...

29:00.447 --> 29:02.740
than the Bureau of Investigations.

29:03.700 --> 29:06.493
I've been with the Department and
the Bureau for seven years.

29:06.661 --> 29:07.745
Almost as long as you.

29:08.621 --> 29:09.663
No.

29:10.206 --> 29:14.501
You were with the old Bureau seven years,
and that Bureau is now gone, sir.

29:15.462 --> 29:16.837
And so are you.

29:17.005 --> 29:21.133
I quickly dismissed all agents

29:21.301 --> 29:23.927
Education, physical fitness...

29:24.095 --> 29:26.013
but, above all, loyalty.

29:30.643 --> 29:34.188
I've had two made.
Same cut, different pattern.

29:36.191 --> 29:39.026
And two suits for you.
They'll be delivered on Friday.

29:39.194 --> 29:40.527
Thank you, Mother.

29:45.116 --> 29:46.533
Lt's platinum...

29:47.660 --> 29:51.121
six diamonds and a star sapphire.

29:54.375 --> 29:56.043
- Heh.
- Lt's absolutely beautiful, Mother.

29:56.211 --> 29:57.461
Thank you.

30:00.215 --> 30:03.467
I've told the whole neighborhood
about you. They all know.

30:04.886 --> 30:07.554
No, I shouldn't,
I've been gaining weight, Mother.

30:07.722 --> 30:11.809
Lt's solid weight. There's nothing wrong
with solid weight on a man.

30:13.394 --> 30:15.813
- All right.
- I'm so incredibly proud of you, Edgar.

30:22.278 --> 30:24.404
I'm starting an album for you.

30:25.406 --> 30:28.575
I'm gonna put everything in it.
This is just the beginning.

30:28.743 --> 30:35.123
"Johnny Hoover appointed acting director
of the Bureau of Investigations."

30:35.291 --> 30:36.750
Can you read that?

30:41.422 --> 30:43.006
You proud of your uncle?

30:59.274 --> 31:00.315
Gentlemen.

31:04.237 --> 31:06.280
I want to introduce you. Come with me.

31:09.075 --> 31:10.742
Edgar, good to see you.

31:10.910 --> 31:12.286
Good to see you, Lawrence.

31:12.453 --> 31:14.955
I'd like to introduce you
to Mr. Clyde Tolson.

31:15.123 --> 31:17.916
Graduated from George Washington
University tonight with a law degree.

31:18.084 --> 31:19.126
Hmm.

31:19.294 --> 31:20.627
Congratulations, Mr. Tolson.

31:20.795 --> 31:24.798
Thank you, Mr. Hoover. I believe you are
one of our most distinguished alumni.

31:24.966 --> 31:28.635
I did, yes. I, uh, do have a degree
from the school, yes.

31:31.097 --> 31:34.558
I was admiring your suit, Mr. Tolson.
You should take a lesson, Lawrence.

31:34.726 --> 31:37.477
Thank you, sir. lt's a custom cut,
from Garfinkel's department store.

31:37.645 --> 31:39.104
Ah.

31:41.608 --> 31:43.650
Do you have a card, Mr. Tolson?

31:43.818 --> 31:46.236
I do, yes, of course.

31:47.447 --> 31:48.488
Here you go.

31:48.823 --> 31:50.532
Good to see you, Lawrence.

31:51.618 --> 31:52.659
Thank you, sir.

31:57.206 --> 32:00.709
"Well-educated, highly recommended,
willing to guarantee five years service.

32:00.877 --> 32:03.545
Has a family in New York
and a new baby."

32:03.713 --> 32:04.755
No interview.

32:05.381 --> 32:07.507
The family in New York or the baby?

32:07.675 --> 32:11.470
Miss Gandy, five years is not enough.
We need men willing to dedicate their lives.

32:11.638 --> 32:13.138
How many is that so far?

32:13.306 --> 32:18.560
- That's 320 denied and 21 interviews.
- Hmm.

32:18.728 --> 32:22.856
Did we receive an application
from a Mr. Tolson?

32:23.024 --> 32:25.192
Yes.

32:27.528 --> 32:31.156
Yes, his report states
he has confidence, poise...

32:31.324 --> 32:33.742
his diction is excellent.

32:33.910 --> 32:38.413
But although physically fitted for it,
might be displeased with rugged work.

32:38.581 --> 32:42.876
His only interest is to gain experience
that would benefit a private law practice.

32:43.044 --> 32:46.630
And he has no interest in being here
for any period of time...

32:46.798 --> 32:49.675
which would render
employment speculative.

32:50.468 --> 32:51.885
Hmm.

32:52.053 --> 32:54.763
He did receive
a letter of recommendation...

32:54.931 --> 32:58.392
from the executive assistant
of the Secretary of War.

32:59.060 --> 33:01.019
That's fantastic, Miss Gandy.

33:01.187 --> 33:08.193
Yes. lt mentions here that Mr. Tolson
showed no particular interest in women.

33:10.738 --> 33:16.076
Then again, some of our best agents excel
because they have no family encumbrance.

33:17.245 --> 33:20.414
Yes, you're right. Set up an interview.

33:23.543 --> 33:25.544
You know what the problem is,
Miss Gandy?

33:25.753 --> 33:28.714
These men, they don't...
They don't look up to me.

33:28.881 --> 33:30.048
Of course they do.

33:30.216 --> 33:35.137
I don't mean figuratively.
I mean they don't look up to me.

33:35.304 --> 33:39.266
Well, if you could conduct the entire
interview from behind your desk...

33:39.434 --> 33:44.646
instead of walking about the office,
I could correct that.

33:44.814 --> 33:46.481
Indeed.

33:48.735 --> 33:52.779
Miss Gandy, suppose I had information
on someone in a position of power...

33:54.115 --> 33:56.324
harmful information.

33:57.118 --> 33:59.703
Lt goes against my nature
to destroy such information...

33:59.871 --> 34:02.873
but I don't trust it
in the general files either.

34:04.959 --> 34:06.626
Could I trust it with you?

34:06.794 --> 34:10.880
If we were to create a confidential file?

34:11.799 --> 34:13.507
Of course, Edgar.

34:15.678 --> 34:16.762
Thank you, Miss Gandy.

34:20.891 --> 34:23.101
Information is power.

34:23.268 --> 34:26.228
Lt protected us from the communists
in 1919...

34:26.397 --> 34:30.734
and since has been vigilantly collected,
organized, and maintained by our FBI.

34:32.737 --> 34:35.489
Attorney General Kennedy's Office.

34:39.744 --> 34:44.121
Did you always have this fireplace
or did you have it put in?

34:44.540 --> 34:45.581
Lt was put in.

34:45.750 --> 34:48.335
What were you doing with wiretaps
in that house?

34:49.545 --> 34:53.507
You asked that I pursue this
organized crime element, Mr. Kennedy...

34:53.674 --> 34:56.176
and I did so, sir, with diligence.

34:56.844 --> 34:59.137
- Do you use the fireplace?
- Rarely.

34:59.305 --> 35:00.847
Who else has heard the recording?

35:01.849 --> 35:05.352
I have filed the matter
personal and confidential.

35:05.686 --> 35:07.646
I'm the only person with access to it.

35:09.232 --> 35:11.900
Mr. Hoover, I asked you to pursue
a real threat.

35:12.068 --> 35:15.695
Instead, you've publicly denied
the existence of organized crime...

35:15.863 --> 35:18.198
and now this gross display
of intimidation.

35:18.366 --> 35:22.035
Mr. Attorney General,
I was only following orders.

35:22.203 --> 35:24.454
We bugged the basement of a home
in Los Angeles...

35:24.622 --> 35:27.541
that was a known gathering place
for lawbreakers.

35:27.708 --> 35:32.129
How was I to know that an East German
communist would be down there...

35:32.296 --> 35:36.049
having sex with your brother,
the President of the United States?

35:37.051 --> 35:40.637
Do not shoot the messenger, sir.
I am here to protect you both.

35:40.805 --> 35:42.472
Remember that.

35:45.434 --> 35:47.018
What do you want from me?

35:50.064 --> 35:52.732
If this information were to go public...

35:52.900 --> 35:57.737
it would create widespread distrust
in your brother's leadership capabilities.

35:58.197 --> 36:01.741
And above all else, I hold the well-being
of our country paramount.

36:01.909 --> 36:04.536
So how may I help you, Mr. Hoover?

36:04.704 --> 36:09.583
Well, if I am to pursue the elements
that you consider a threat...

36:09.750 --> 36:13.420
I humbly request that you allow me
the same power and access...

36:13.588 --> 36:16.423
to follow the groups that I see
as an immediate threat.

36:16.591 --> 36:18.925
Lt's not 1920 anymore.

36:20.720 --> 36:22.929
You know who Stanley Levinson is, sir?

36:24.390 --> 36:25.724
A lawyer.

36:26.100 --> 36:30.103
A white, communist lawyer
organizing at the highest levels...

36:30.271 --> 36:32.022
including the SCLC.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.940
Now, their group is growing.

36:34.108 --> 36:36.318
They are entirely self-serving...

36:36.527 --> 36:40.113
and their leadership is openly critical
of this department here.

36:40.281 --> 36:42.032
Did you read the memos that I sent?

36:42.200 --> 36:44.451
No, no, I can't say that I have.

36:46.454 --> 36:48.455
Lt says right here, Mr. Kennedy.

36:48.623 --> 36:50.290
They claim we are...

36:50.458 --> 36:53.919
"unable to get convictions in even
the worst, most heinous crimes..."

36:54.086 --> 36:57.214
and that we have "faltered under
the pressure, complexities...

36:57.381 --> 36:59.674
and responsibilities of our office,"
in print.

36:59.842 --> 37:03.553
- Right here in "The Washington Post."
- You can't bear a little criticism?

37:03.721 --> 37:05.972
Well, it depends on what their aim is.

37:06.140 --> 37:08.308
They are gaining considerable power.

37:08.476 --> 37:11.353
Their priorities are singularly focused
on their own issues.

37:11.520 --> 37:13.730
They are trying to incite revolt.

37:14.649 --> 37:17.484
Frankly, they sound more critical
of your office than mine.

37:18.194 --> 37:21.112
There's a new face to communism,
Edgar, and this isn't it.

37:23.157 --> 37:25.825
Communism is a foreign threat now,
not domestic.

37:28.162 --> 37:31.831
Mr. Kennedy,
before you were even born...

37:32.833 --> 37:36.294
I heard that very same argument
from a Mr. Mitchell Palmer.

37:37.338 --> 37:39.839
Do you know what it took
to change his mind?

37:40.174 --> 37:41.174
A bomb.

37:41.842 --> 37:45.428
If he would have sat in his rocking chair
five more minutes in 1919...

37:45.596 --> 37:49.599
we'd have been lucky enough
to find an intact index finger.

37:49.767 --> 37:53.144
Now, I do not want that to happen
to you or your brother, sir.

37:54.021 --> 37:57.190
There's no reason
we both can't get what we want.

37:57.358 --> 38:01.695
We can wage a war on two fronts, sir.
You understand?

38:03.906 --> 38:06.533
You can go now, Mr. Hoover.

38:09.704 --> 38:10.996
Yes, sir.

38:12.123 --> 38:14.541
Please leave the transcripts here with me.

38:16.752 --> 38:18.003
Yes, sir.

38:23.801 --> 38:26.803
Oh, and feel free and share them
with your brother.

38:28.889 --> 38:33.310
Oh, and let him know that I have
a copy of my own in safekeeping.

38:50.870 --> 38:52.954
- Unh.
- Your 4:00 is here, sir.

38:53.122 --> 38:55.540
Thank you, Miss Gandy.
Send him right in, thank you.

38:59.879 --> 39:03.214
Please, have a seat, Mr. Tolson.

39:03.382 --> 39:07.093
- Mr. Hoover, thank you for this opportunity.
- Yes. Please.

39:07.261 --> 39:09.596
- Have a seat.
- Thank you, sir.

39:09.764 --> 39:13.224
There were several problems
with your application, Mr. Tolson...

39:13.392 --> 39:16.311
not the least of which is the fact
that you did not show...

39:16.479 --> 39:18.730
the proper requirement to the Bureau...

39:20.441 --> 39:24.069
nor the proper dedication
to protecting the American people...

39:24.236 --> 39:25.278
and the American way.

39:25.446 --> 39:27.864
May I remind you
that this is not a platform...

39:28.032 --> 39:31.451
to a fatter paycheck in
private practice, Mr. Tolson?

39:35.456 --> 39:38.291
Ls there something the matter,
Mr. Tolson?

39:38.459 --> 39:40.460
No, sir.

39:40.628 --> 39:43.630
Ls exercise a requirement
for all agents, sir?

39:45.883 --> 39:49.803
Yes. All our agents need to be
in top physical condition.

39:49.970 --> 39:54.307
We must outsmart and outmatch
the public enemy at every turn.

39:54.475 --> 39:56.017
Yes, of course.

39:56.185 --> 39:59.479
So, uh, what routine do you do, sir?

39:59.647 --> 40:03.108
Push-ups, sit-ups, and squatting.

40:04.485 --> 40:05.777
I see.

40:05.945 --> 40:07.654
Would you like me to fix the curtain?

40:08.406 --> 40:09.989
Or perhaps I could open a window.

40:10.157 --> 40:12.617
I always prefer
a little bit of air after exercise.

40:12.785 --> 40:14.702
Don't you?

40:15.496 --> 40:16.996
If it would please you.

40:18.124 --> 40:21.126
And, sir, where I may fall short
in terms of resume...

40:22.128 --> 40:25.797
I apparently far exceed
the rest in terms of honesty.

40:26.924 --> 40:28.591
I didn't lie to get this appointment, sir.

40:28.759 --> 40:31.219
Like the rest, yes,
I would like to start a practice...

40:31.387 --> 40:37.016
but I could be persuaded otherwise
if the right opportunities were to arise.

40:38.519 --> 40:40.019
Hmm.

40:41.564 --> 40:44.107
Fair enough, Mr. Tolson.

40:46.193 --> 40:47.485
Fair enough.

41:00.291 --> 41:02.292
These sleeves seem to be
the correct length.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.002
I found you two tie options.

41:04.170 --> 41:06.379
This one is a bit more fashion-forward...

41:06.547 --> 41:09.090
but it would complement this suit
and cut and fabric.

41:09.258 --> 41:10.800
Lt's too loud, don't you think?

41:10.968 --> 41:13.678
Too loud? Okay, which is why
I found this one, the backup.

41:13.846 --> 41:18.558
- lt's a bit more directorial, a little bit more...
- Lt's a little bit more reserved, I agree.

41:18.726 --> 41:22.729
Let's keep this as a second option, please.
Thank you, Clyde.

41:24.732 --> 41:26.733
Are you Mr. John Hoover?

41:26.901 --> 41:28.193
I am. ls there a problem?

41:28.360 --> 41:32.489
Lt seems there's a Mr. John Hoover
whose credit has gone bad with us.

41:32.656 --> 41:34.199
That would appear to be you.

41:34.366 --> 41:36.993
That is not me, sir, on my word.

41:37.161 --> 41:41.956
My mother calls me Edgar, my niece calls
me J.E., and I sign John E., not John.

41:42.124 --> 41:45.877
Well, sir, if you're a friend
of Mr. Tolson's...

41:46.045 --> 41:49.589
just choose one name and reapply.

41:49.757 --> 41:51.591
All right.

41:52.218 --> 41:53.551
Thank you very much.

42:03.896 --> 42:04.938
Morning, Miss Gandy.

42:05.648 --> 42:07.649
What? You don't like it?

42:09.068 --> 42:12.904
Mr. Hoover,
there's been a massacre in Kansas City.

42:15.032 --> 42:16.074
One of our own?

42:18.744 --> 42:20.620
Special Agent Caffrey?

42:21.330 --> 42:22.372
Let him have it!

42:23.290 --> 42:26.793
By 1930, the communist threat
had been beaten back...

42:27.378 --> 42:30.630
but the Depression had hit
and there was a new threat.

42:30.798 --> 42:33.508
The bank robber, the car thief,
and the kidnapper.

42:33.676 --> 42:38.972
But, unfortunately, as with communism,
America didn't react with scorn.

42:39.139 --> 42:42.225
They gave the American gangster
admiration.

42:42.393 --> 42:44.894
And the defiance by desperate,
armed criminals...

42:45.062 --> 42:49.190
of the forces of society and
civilization can no longer be ignored.

42:49.358 --> 42:53.236
Bugs Moran and Al Capone
top the list of public enemies.

42:53.404 --> 42:56.531
Look around you.
They could be anywhere.

42:56.699 --> 43:01.286
May I remind you that the Bureau of
Investigation seeks to be your protector.

43:01.453 --> 43:04.664
It belongs to you. It is as close to you
as your nearest telephone.

43:06.041 --> 43:07.500
And with your help...

43:08.294 --> 43:11.462
Warner Bros. presents

43:11.630 --> 43:13.339
"The Public Enemy."

43:14.049 --> 43:17.677
James Cagney plays
public enemy number one.

43:19.013 --> 43:20.513
- Why, you.
- Aah!

43:22.224 --> 43:24.267
There you go with that wishing stuff again.

43:24.435 --> 43:26.227
Maybe you found someone
you like better.

43:29.189 --> 43:31.524
Coming soon to your neighborhood theater.

43:32.818 --> 43:33.860
Fantastic.

43:34.737 --> 43:39.365
That summer, a single crime opened
the door to set things right.

43:40.075 --> 43:42.827
Do you know what that was, Mr. Jones?

43:42.995 --> 43:44.329
Sorry, sir, what was that?

43:44.496 --> 43:47.665
Who is the most famous man
of the 20th Century thus far?

43:48.834 --> 43:50.209
Joe McCarthy, sir?

43:51.587 --> 43:54.589
Mr. McCarthy was an opportunist...

43:55.090 --> 43:57.175
not a patriot, Mr. Jones.

44:00.888 --> 44:04.724
Who is the most famous man
of the 20th Century thus far?

44:05.476 --> 44:07.226
The most famous?

44:07.770 --> 44:09.896
Ls that you, sir?

44:17.404 --> 44:20.740
Well, I suppose his notoriety
depends on the field that he is in.

44:20.908 --> 44:24.077
His field was in the clouds.

44:25.245 --> 44:27.205
Well, then Charles Lindbergh, sir.

44:40.511 --> 44:41.552
Yes?

44:41.720 --> 44:44.681
Charles Lindbergh's
baby has been kidnapped from his home.

44:44.848 --> 44:48.434
Send officers from Trenton.
I'll be on the first train.

44:53.565 --> 44:54.774
What is it?

44:57.778 --> 45:00.738
Charles Lindbergh...
Lindbergh's baby's been kidnapped.

45:02.616 --> 45:03.700
You've got to find him.

45:06.078 --> 45:07.954
He has to be brought home alive.

45:09.206 --> 45:10.248
Yes, Mother.

45:13.585 --> 45:15.294
Yes, Mother, I know.

45:18.215 --> 45:22.927
When we arrived at Mr. Lindbergh's
home that morning in 1932...

45:23.095 --> 45:26.431
we began an investigation that would
forever change our Bureau.

45:26.598 --> 45:29.892
This morning we've heard from
the Pennsylvania Railroad, Will Rogers...

45:30.060 --> 45:32.979
President Hoover,
Governor Roosevelt, Customs...

45:33.147 --> 45:34.897
the U.S. Mail, and the Boy Scouts.

45:35.065 --> 45:36.649
All of you. Get off of that dirt.

45:36.817 --> 45:39.485
You're trampling evidence.
Immediately! Get off!

45:39.653 --> 45:42.613
There's nothing there. We checked.
No defined footprints.

45:42.781 --> 45:44.991
Lt appears he was wearing fabric
on his shoes.

45:45.159 --> 45:47.827
You don't think the size
could've held some value?

45:47.995 --> 45:51.330
How did he get up there? Are there
marks on the window and wall as well?

45:51.498 --> 45:53.458
A ladder.
We found it 100 yards away.

45:53.625 --> 45:55.084
We moved it inside.

45:55.252 --> 45:56.419
You moved it?

45:56.587 --> 45:58.171
Yes, for safekeeping.

45:58.338 --> 46:02.341
Congratulations, Mr. Schwarzkopf.
You have contaminated the crime scene.

46:02.509 --> 46:04.594
Now, get your boots off this property.

46:04.762 --> 46:07.054
And what right do you have
to be here, Mister, uh...?

46:07.222 --> 46:09.849
J. Edgar Hoover,
director of the Bureau of Investigation.

46:10.017 --> 46:13.019
We've been sent by President Hoover
to ensure the investigation...

46:13.187 --> 46:16.272
The president has authorized access
to all documents and evidence.

46:16.440 --> 46:20.276
Mr. Hoover, you're free to observe, but
New Jersey's not the president's domain.

46:20.444 --> 46:24.030
And where is Mr. Lindbergh?
I'd like to hear his opinion on the matter.

46:24.198 --> 46:26.282
- Mr. Lindbergh's around back.
- After you, sir.

46:26.450 --> 46:28.117
He's been up all night.

46:28.285 --> 46:31.329
Mr. Lindbergh himself
came down to meet me.

46:31.497 --> 46:36.542
He shook my hand and expressed his
gratitude and faith in our young Bureau.

46:37.294 --> 46:39.295
He fell five feet.

46:39.463 --> 46:40.713
Who did?

46:42.841 --> 46:45.218
The kidnapper, with the child in his arms.

46:46.470 --> 46:48.179
That's speculation, Mr. Hoover.

46:48.347 --> 46:53.017
Mr. Lindbergh, sir, if the ladder had split
while the person was on their way up...

46:53.185 --> 46:55.978
it would have collapsed.
You see, it was a miscalculation.

46:56.146 --> 47:00.691
Lt was meant to bear the weight of a man,
but not the weight of a man and child.

47:00.859 --> 47:01.901
We have other theories.

47:02.903 --> 47:04.028
Where's the ransom note?

47:04.988 --> 47:06.197
Of course.

47:07.825 --> 47:10.368
And you are touching that
with your bare hands as well?

47:10.536 --> 47:11.577
We checked.

47:11.745 --> 47:15.122
There are none of those finger imprints
that you fancy so valuable.

47:15.290 --> 47:17.083
Please hand it over, Mr. Schwarzkopf.

47:17.251 --> 47:19.919
That's Colonel Schwarzkopf.

47:22.381 --> 47:25.216
"Have 50,000 dollars ready,"
spelled R-E-D-Y.

47:25.384 --> 47:29.011
"We will inform you where,"
spelled W-E-R-E, "to deliver the money"...

47:29.179 --> 47:30.513
spelled M-O-N-Y.

47:30.681 --> 47:34.851
"We warn you for making anything public
or for notify the police.

47:35.018 --> 47:39.772
Indication for all letters are signature,"
S-I-N-G, "singnature."

47:40.691 --> 47:42.275
Three holes.

47:43.861 --> 47:45.945
I want this letter and the ladder.

47:46.113 --> 47:48.281
No jurisdiction.
I've showed what you asked for.

47:48.448 --> 47:50.867
- lt's time for you to go.
- Mr. Lindbergh, please...

47:51.034 --> 47:54.412
Mr. Hoover, thank you. As you can see,
we have everything under control.

47:54.580 --> 47:56.372
Thank you, gentlemen.

47:56.540 --> 47:58.624
Thank you for your time, Mr. Lindbergh.

48:00.043 --> 48:01.085
Clyde.

48:09.845 --> 48:12.930
Clyde, I'm afraid for his boy.

48:13.348 --> 48:15.641
He trusts the local police more than us.

48:15.851 --> 48:17.310
He thinks we're all fools.

48:17.477 --> 48:21.397
He'll go around them too.
He's going to bargain with the kidnappers.

48:23.567 --> 48:26.611
President Hoover called me the morning
the child was taken...

48:26.778 --> 48:29.947
and asked me to do whatever was
in my power to solve this crime.

48:30.115 --> 48:33.075
But do you know what all the power
of the Bureau means...

48:33.243 --> 48:38.205
without federal laws, without arms,
without the ability to make arrests?

48:38.373 --> 48:40.207
Lt means nothing.

48:40.375 --> 48:43.961
Mr. Chairman, I urge passage
of the Lindbergh Law...

48:44.129 --> 48:46.505
making kidnapping a federal offense.

48:46.673 --> 48:50.676
To immediately deliver all the fingerprints
in this country to my office...

48:50.844 --> 48:53.012
so that we may create a central file.

48:53.180 --> 48:56.349
To help arm our agents
so that they have a fighting chance...

48:56.516 --> 49:00.353
against the submachine guns of some
of the most dangerous characters...

49:00.520 --> 49:02.480
in the history of American criminality.

49:02.648 --> 49:06.067
And I urge you to do this
in the name of Little Lindy.

49:06.234 --> 49:09.528
Because if he can be taken,
then what child is safe?

49:09.696 --> 49:15.451
And if we cannot aid in his safe return,
then what use are we?

49:38.016 --> 49:40.142
Every fingerprint
from the local authorities...

49:40.310 --> 49:44.522
across the country began flowing in.
Finally, we had a centralized system.

49:44.690 --> 49:46.232
What is it, Edgar?

49:47.651 --> 49:50.027
The last of the fingerprints came in
from Chicago.

49:52.072 --> 49:57.118
You know our new president has scheduled
a meeting with me, Miss Gandy?

49:58.578 --> 50:02.748
Do you know that there are talks
of reorganizing the Bureau?

50:03.375 --> 50:05.668
Yes, I've heard similar whispers.

50:05.836 --> 50:07.003
Hmm.

50:07.170 --> 50:08.754
Have you?

50:10.966 --> 50:15.094
Miss Gandy, do you remember that file
we created on his wife?

50:15.262 --> 50:16.846
Mrs. Roosevelt?

50:17.014 --> 50:18.597
Yes.

50:18.765 --> 50:20.933
Will you make a copy for me, please?

50:21.768 --> 50:23.602
Yes, of course.

50:25.272 --> 50:27.106
Thank you, Miss Gandy.

51:00.766 --> 51:03.934
Lindbergh hired criminals to find his son.

51:04.227 --> 51:06.520
Off the desk now, Agent Garrison,
follow me.

51:06.688 --> 51:07.730
Yes, sir.

51:07.898 --> 51:10.983
He even got an offer from Al Capone
to help pay the ransom money...

51:11.151 --> 51:15.071
but, in the end, he employed an
eccentric by the name of John Condon...

51:15.238 --> 51:19.492
who placed a newspaper ad to act
as a go-between with the kidnappers.

51:19.659 --> 51:22.078
Now, was Condon a criminal too?

51:22.245 --> 51:25.623
He most certainly wasn't
an agent of the law, Mr. Garrison.

51:25.791 --> 51:27.333
Why are you doing this?

51:28.460 --> 51:30.920
So a mother may have her baby again.

51:31.546 --> 51:34.673
And you may know that the
American people are grateful...

51:34.841 --> 51:37.968
for the honor bestowed upon them
by your pluck and daring.

51:38.136 --> 51:42.515
And how do we know the kidnapper is the
same that wrote the letters that you have?

51:43.600 --> 51:47.770
The symbol, uh, matches
the original letter's symbol, doesn't it?

51:51.691 --> 51:53.484
What is it, Mr. Lindbergh?

51:56.696 --> 51:59.698
In a moment of thoughtlessness...

51:59.866 --> 52:02.034
I showed the symbol
to some other men...

52:02.202 --> 52:05.037
and I'm not sure
that they were trustworthy.

52:06.373 --> 52:08.165
I'm not sure anyone is trustworthy.

52:10.001 --> 52:11.877
I will be having your letters analyzed...

52:12.045 --> 52:15.381
to make sure that they
are from the same author.

52:16.216 --> 52:19.552
And while Mr. Lindbergh
placed his faith in hoodlums...

52:19.719 --> 52:23.222
we began cultivating the one thing
criminals couldn't fight...

52:23.390 --> 52:25.057
with all the guns in the world.

52:25.225 --> 52:29.353
Gentlemen, please leave this room.
Clear all these tables. Time to go, now.

52:29.521 --> 52:30.688
Where can we smoke, sir?

52:30.856 --> 52:32.439
Not my concern. Out of my sight.

52:32.607 --> 52:35.734
- Mr. Osborne, tell us what you need.
- Uh, bright lights, a microscope...

52:35.902 --> 52:38.404
measuring instruments,
magnifying glasses. A, uh, projector.

52:38.572 --> 52:41.532
You have the full resources of the Bureau.
Don't be shy.

52:41.700 --> 52:43.826
Paper samples from
every regional manufacturer.

52:43.994 --> 52:47.621
Mr. Osborne, this is Mr. Tolson.
Supply Mr. Osborne whatever he needs...

52:47.789 --> 52:51.333
to conclude without a doubt that
these letters came from the same author.

52:51.960 --> 52:53.043
Hmm?

52:54.880 --> 52:57.047
Gentlemen, please. Thank you.

52:59.676 --> 53:02.887
- Should we tell the attorney general?
- So he can say no a third time?

53:03.054 --> 53:06.807
- Just post a sign, like this one.
- What would you like it to say, "keep out"?

53:06.975 --> 53:09.560
"The Bureau of Investigations
Technical Laboratory."

53:09.728 --> 53:13.731
Have it carved and nailed to the wall.
If he wants it gone, he'll have to tear it out.

53:13.899 --> 53:16.901
Lt's time we at least have one thing
the bad guys don't.

53:17.068 --> 53:18.110
Decorating skills?

53:18.278 --> 53:19.820
Science, Clyde. Science.

53:19.988 --> 53:24.116
Uh, the ink is different,
but the handwriting is a match.

53:24.284 --> 53:29.079
Whoever Mr. Condon is corresponding with
is the person who wrote the original note.

53:29.247 --> 53:31.207
Or Condon wrote all the notes himself.

53:31.374 --> 53:34.001
Lindbergh is planning on using
Condon to deliver the ransom.

53:34.169 --> 53:36.629
- May have already happened.
- Call the Internal Revenue Service.

53:36.796 --> 53:40.633
Get them to Lindbergh's home.
I insist that all those bills be marked.

53:40.800 --> 53:41.884
Yes, sir.

53:42.052 --> 53:44.887
Ls that all, Mr. Hoover?
I have a 2:30 p.m. class to teach.

53:45.055 --> 53:47.139
No, you don't.
Consider your pay doubled.

53:47.307 --> 53:52.144
You work for your country now,
Mr. Osborne. Congratulations.

53:54.731 --> 53:56.148
Doctor!

54:06.576 --> 54:08.160
Have you gotted the money?

54:08.995 --> 54:11.580
I can't bring the
money till I see the baby.

54:17.420 --> 54:19.964
I promise you there's no police.

54:20.757 --> 54:22.424
Lt's too dangerous.

54:28.598 --> 54:32.184
Stop! Stop this now!

54:34.271 --> 54:35.980
No one's gonna harm you.

54:36.147 --> 54:37.898
If they catch me, they will.

54:38.066 --> 54:40.442
No, they only want the child.

54:40.610 --> 54:43.988
They'll give me 30 years if I'm caught.
They could burn me.

54:44.155 --> 54:45.614
No. No.

54:45.782 --> 54:46.865
I didn't do it.

54:47.033 --> 54:48.659
I'm only the messenger.

54:49.244 --> 54:50.995
Eh!

54:51.162 --> 54:52.997
What if the baby is dead?

54:54.249 --> 54:55.874
Would I burn if the baby is dead?

54:57.544 --> 55:00.045
Why would we be meeting
if the baby was dead?

55:00.213 --> 55:03.507
Place another ad in the paper
when you have the money.

55:09.889 --> 55:14.226
So if a ransom had to be paid,
we needed those bills traced.

55:14.394 --> 55:18.564
We brought in the IRS, and, for his
own good, we had to force his hand.

55:18.732 --> 55:21.567
I thought gold notes were going
out of circulation, Mr. Irey.

55:21.735 --> 55:23.068
That's our hope.

55:23.236 --> 55:25.112
It'll make these bills more identifiable.

55:25.280 --> 55:27.865
I have no need for the money.
I just want my son.

55:29.409 --> 55:32.369
This isn't just about your son,
Mr. Lindbergh.

55:32.537 --> 55:36.415
If these kidnappers go free,
then no child in this country will be safe.

55:36.583 --> 55:41.378
That's why I've assembled a 26-man team,
headed by Special Agent Sisk here.

55:41.546 --> 55:45.758
And if they find out you're involved,
I may never see my son again.

55:46.551 --> 55:49.470
Mr. Lindbergh, sir,
we will not pursue a single lead...

55:49.637 --> 55:51.930
until your child is safe
in his mother's arms.

55:52.098 --> 55:54.850
You have my word, sir.

56:02.942 --> 56:05.944
The kidnapping of
Charles A. Lindbergh, Jr., was a tragedy...

56:06.112 --> 56:08.697
not only to Colonel and Mrs. Lindbergh,
but to the nation.

56:08.865 --> 56:11.950
His abduction from his Hopewell home
was a challenge to America.

56:12.118 --> 56:14.870
This ladder, the only clue
to the kidnapping, was homemade.

56:15.038 --> 56:17.956
Let the developments in the Lindbergh
case start a new drive...

56:18.124 --> 56:21.001
to wipe out the stain,
not only of that wanton kidnapping...

56:21.169 --> 56:24.088
but of all kidnapping and crimes.

56:26.800 --> 56:28.217
Hey, doctor!

56:29.219 --> 56:32.262
Give your word not to open for six hours.

56:34.474 --> 56:35.599
Thank you.

56:43.775 --> 56:45.943
I talked him out of 20,000 dollars.

56:46.111 --> 56:49.488
I'd prefer him happy than save the money.
I don't want to upset him.

56:50.573 --> 56:51.824
Where is the baby?

56:51.991 --> 56:54.576
I promised not to open this for six hours.

56:54.744 --> 56:57.329
You gave your word, I did not.

56:58.832 --> 57:03.293
"The boy is on boat Nelly.
Lt is a small boat, 28 feet long.

57:03.461 --> 57:06.505
Two persons are on the boat.
They are innocent.

57:06.673 --> 57:11.677
You'll find the boat between Horseneck's
Beach and Gay Head near Elizabeth Island."

57:11.845 --> 57:13.846
That's Nantucket, right?

57:17.851 --> 57:19.059
What was in the boat?

57:19.227 --> 57:20.602
There was no boat.

57:20.770 --> 57:23.439
Lindbergh didn't trust us.
He wanted to do things his way.

57:23.606 --> 57:27.192
And who can blame him?
No one respected us at that time.

57:27.360 --> 57:29.069
Mr. Hoover, we've been calling.

57:29.237 --> 57:30.863
Edgar.

57:33.450 --> 57:35.659
Time to go, Agent Garrison. Right now.

57:36.536 --> 57:39.705
The Attorney General has authorized
your wiretaps.

57:39.873 --> 57:41.707
Very good, Miss Gandy.

57:42.542 --> 57:46.712
Edgar, are you sure about this?
Once you do this, Edgar, it's done.

57:46.880 --> 57:50.674
When I prove myself correct, we will have
saved this country another revolution.

57:50.842 --> 57:52.509
History will remember that, Clyde.

57:52.677 --> 57:53.886
But if you are wrong...

57:54.053 --> 57:57.389
history will remember it as an
illegal move over a petty grudge.

57:57.557 --> 58:00.517
Do you consider our reputation petty,
Mr. Tolson?

58:00.685 --> 58:03.312
- No, I...
- Then order the wires.

58:04.814 --> 58:08.150
- Can we discuss this over dinner?
- After you've ordered the wires.

58:10.445 --> 58:11.987
Yes, sir.

58:24.584 --> 58:26.335
The director's on his way.

58:49.817 --> 58:51.985
- Ahem.
- After you.

59:13.800 --> 59:15.092
Wait, please.

59:21.808 --> 59:24.768
Harvey's Restaurant, sir?
- No, to the White House.

59:35.446 --> 59:37.531
We were in the midst
of a Great Depression...

59:37.699 --> 59:40.492
and breaths away from
history's worst war.

59:40.660 --> 59:44.496
We needed more power to protect,
but, as with every new president...

59:44.664 --> 59:49.167
this Bureau's future and my very job
was being drawn into question.

59:49.335 --> 59:52.337
- The president is ready to see you now.
- Alrighty.

01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:03.473
Come in. Have a seat, Mr. Hoover.

01:00:06.519 --> 01:00:09.646
Lt's the same dance each time.
They make me wait.

01:00:09.814 --> 01:00:14.860
They imagine I'm sweating, that they're
gonna show me who's boss, I play along.

01:00:15.028 --> 01:00:16.653
Thank you.

01:00:16.821 --> 01:00:18.697
And then did you show him
the transcript?

01:00:18.865 --> 01:00:21.825
No. He didn't want to read it.
That was unique.

01:00:21.993 --> 01:00:24.202
He wanted me to tell him about it.

01:00:24.370 --> 01:00:26.079
What, how you came across it?

01:00:26.247 --> 01:00:30.375
No, I explained to him up front
we never expected to find Mrs. Roosevelt...

01:00:30.543 --> 01:00:32.961
in the bedroom of
a known communist agitator...

01:00:33.129 --> 01:00:36.548
much less having what sounded like
an intimate moment.

01:00:36.716 --> 01:00:39.718
That I needed his advice
on how to proceed.

01:00:39.886 --> 01:00:42.346
I wanted to let him know he had an ally.

01:00:42.513 --> 01:00:44.514
Before he had a chance
to ask you to resign.

01:00:44.682 --> 01:00:45.932
Exactly.

01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:48.894
When I was finished,
he simply pushed the file aside...

01:00:49.062 --> 01:00:53.315
as if he was unconcerned with it.

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:57.361
Clyde, the President of the United States
is afraid.

01:00:58.488 --> 01:01:00.072
What, he's afraid of you?

01:01:00.239 --> 01:01:04.117
Of a potential invasion from abroad.

01:01:04.994 --> 01:01:07.579
We'll have two glasses
of your finest champagne.

01:01:07.747 --> 01:01:09.206
Of course, Mr. Hoover.

01:01:10.083 --> 01:01:12.584
Ahem.
- You're drinking now?

01:01:12.752 --> 01:01:14.753
We're celebrating, Clyde,
we're celebrating.

01:01:15.546 --> 01:01:18.131
You know I feel I could trust you
with anything, right?

01:01:18.299 --> 01:01:19.925
Well, I'd like to think so.

01:01:22.303 --> 01:01:24.971
The president signed a secret order...

01:01:25.139 --> 01:01:27.432
granting me increased power
of surveillance...

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:32.354
secret surveillance of communists
and radicals, without warrant.

01:01:33.064 --> 01:01:34.106
Ls that legal?

01:01:34.273 --> 01:01:36.692
Sometimes you need
to bend the rules a little...

01:01:36.859 --> 01:01:39.277
in order to keep
your country safe, right?

01:01:39.445 --> 01:01:43.907
And to make sure I hadn't heard it wrong, I
clarified this with Secretary of State Hull.

01:01:44.075 --> 01:01:48.412
And he said, and I quote, "You go ahead
and investigate those cocksuckers."

01:01:49.664 --> 01:01:52.708
- Vulgar.
- Hmm, agreed.

01:01:55.128 --> 01:01:56.712
Clyde...

01:01:57.463 --> 01:01:59.464
I've been meaning
to ask you something.

01:02:00.174 --> 01:02:01.466
Feel free.

01:02:02.301 --> 01:02:05.804
I need someone who understands
what's at stake here...

01:02:05.972 --> 01:02:07.264
you understand?

01:02:07.432 --> 01:02:09.975
Someone who I can trust...

01:02:11.144 --> 01:02:12.978
an associate director of the Bureau.

01:02:13.146 --> 01:02:16.606
I know you've only been in your
current position for, what, 12 months now.

01:02:16.774 --> 01:02:18.650
Oh, almost 18 now, sir.

01:02:18.818 --> 01:02:21.236
You're missing my point, Clyde.

01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:23.488
I want you to be my number-two man.

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:29.077
I'm not much for the spotlight, Edgar.

01:02:32.498 --> 01:02:34.374
I need you, Clyde.

01:02:34.792 --> 01:02:36.501
Do you understand? I need you.

01:02:39.672 --> 01:02:41.631
On one condition.

01:02:42.258 --> 01:02:45.260
Good day or bad,
whether we agree or disagree...

01:02:45.428 --> 01:02:49.347
we never miss a lunch
or a dinner together.

01:02:50.183 --> 01:02:52.684
Well, I would have it no other way.

01:03:02.195 --> 01:03:04.488
Hey, pull over.

01:03:04.655 --> 01:03:07.949
- Only a half a mile to Mount Rose.
- Can't wait.

01:03:38.064 --> 01:03:39.064
Orville!

01:03:52.954 --> 01:03:57.415
In the end, the child's body
was found just within sight...

01:03:57.583 --> 01:03:59.668
of Mr. Lindbergh's home.

01:04:01.087 --> 01:04:02.921
The body was blackened...

01:04:03.089 --> 01:04:06.049
the left leg missing
from the knee down.

01:04:06.676 --> 01:04:09.594
There was a visible fracture on the skull.

01:04:10.096 --> 01:04:13.265
He'd suffered a violent blow to the head.
I told them months ago.

01:04:13.432 --> 01:04:17.727
He must've fallen on the way down,
with the baby in his arms.

01:04:18.771 --> 01:04:21.231
We are the sinners, Edgar.

01:04:24.193 --> 01:04:29.114
We tolerated lawlessness in the land
until it grew to diabolical proportions.

01:04:30.783 --> 01:04:33.952
The baby's blood is on all our hands,
Edgar.

01:04:35.454 --> 01:04:37.497
On your hands, Edgar.

01:04:43.796 --> 01:04:45.213
Yes, Mother.

01:04:58.519 --> 01:05:00.353
Six weeks after the kidnapping...

01:05:00.521 --> 01:05:02.355
Congress passed the Lindbergh Law...

01:05:02.523 --> 01:05:05.275
making kidnapping a federal offense.

01:05:05.443 --> 01:05:09.321
The right to make arrests followed
and the right to bear arms.

01:05:09.488 --> 01:05:13.950
So I continued collecting the finest
scientific minds in the country.

01:05:16.787 --> 01:05:20.123
He claims to be the world expert
on wood analysis.

01:05:20.541 --> 01:05:24.419
Lt's easy to be the expert if you're the
only person in the world with any interest.

01:05:24.587 --> 01:05:26.922
He does claim he can tell
as much from a cut of wood...

01:05:27.089 --> 01:05:29.257
- ...as a doctor can from an autopsy.
- Ah.

01:05:29.425 --> 01:05:31.843
He has, um, social difficulties.

01:05:32.011 --> 01:05:34.179
He is mentally ill, isn't he?

01:05:34.347 --> 01:05:37.682
He's only as mad as you are. Sir.

01:05:38.517 --> 01:05:41.269
This was supposed to be temporary,
Mr. Hoover.

01:05:41.437 --> 01:05:43.605
If you want your Sherlock Holmes
playing time...

01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:46.358
Where do you suggest we go, sir, where?

01:05:46.525 --> 01:05:48.443
I suggest you take your case
to Congress.

01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:49.903
Fine, sir. Have it your way.

01:05:50.071 --> 01:05:54.991
I'll tell people we could not solve the case
because we could not afford laboratories...

01:05:55.159 --> 01:05:58.078
and the Attorney General
wouldn't allow us to use his lounge.

01:05:58.245 --> 01:06:01.706
Fine. Now get your science fair project
out of here.

01:06:01.874 --> 01:06:03.625
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

01:06:06.212 --> 01:06:07.295
Gentlemen, keep working.

01:06:07.463 --> 01:06:10.507
Mr. Tolson,
let's get the president on the phone.

01:06:12.885 --> 01:06:17.722
The depravations of vicious outlaws, roving
from state to state like packs of wolves...

01:06:17.932 --> 01:06:20.600
amounts to an actual
armed invasion of America.

01:06:20.768 --> 01:06:24.521
We must outsmart and outwit the criminal,
foreign and domestic.

01:06:24.689 --> 01:06:28.650
They have chemists building bombs.
We need chemists tracing their efforts.

01:06:28.818 --> 01:06:31.569
We must have the most advanced
force in the world...

01:06:31.737 --> 01:06:34.155
if we are to have the safest nation
on earth.

01:06:34.323 --> 01:06:37.909
And, please, gentlemen, let us not
for a moment lose sight of our goals:

01:06:38.077 --> 01:06:39.536
To protect the honest citizen...

01:06:39.704 --> 01:06:43.581
to teach the criminal that
regardless of his subterfuges...

01:06:43.749 --> 01:06:46.334
his twisting, his squirming
and slimy wriggling...

01:06:46.502 --> 01:06:49.796
he cannot escape the one
inexorable rule of law enforcement...

01:06:49.964 --> 01:06:51.923
that you can't get away with it.

01:06:52.091 --> 01:06:53.758
Thank you.

01:06:53.926 --> 01:06:54.926
Thank you, Mr. Hoover.

01:06:55.094 --> 01:07:01.016
But your agency is already one of the most
well-funded in Washington, is it not?

01:07:01.183 --> 01:07:02.684
Yes, that is true, sir...

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:06.771
but our car and bank robbery recoveries
totaled 6.5 million last year...

01:07:06.939 --> 01:07:09.399
and our budget is only,
well, two million.

01:07:09.567 --> 01:07:13.111
Unlike other departments in Washington,
we actually run a profit.

01:07:15.281 --> 01:07:17.782
We cannot quantify
the value of our successes...

01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:22.037
with the hoodlums Pretty Boy Floyd,
Baby Face Nelson, Machine Gun Kelly...

01:07:22.204 --> 01:07:24.330
and other hoodlums of that nature.

01:07:24.498 --> 01:07:30.128
Mr. Hoover, is it true that you spend
the Bureau's money on advertising?

01:07:31.922 --> 01:07:36.301
We are not permitted to engage
in advertising of any kind, sir. No.

01:07:36.469 --> 01:07:40.972
But you take part, for instance, in the
making of radio shows and comic books.

01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:43.641
I've listened to several
of these G-Men programs.

01:07:43.809 --> 01:07:48.063
Your picture seems to be shown
in conjunction with them quite frequently.

01:07:49.315 --> 01:07:53.193
We declined emphatically to lend
any form of endorsement...

01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:58.073
had nothing to do with their production,
furnished no advice, technical or otherwise.

01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:01.451
Well, the very advertisement says
that broadcasts were...

01:08:01.619 --> 01:08:05.830
"true reflections,
as contained in the official records...

01:08:05.998 --> 01:08:09.751
based on actual cases from the files
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation...

01:08:09.919 --> 01:08:11.961
Saturday night at 8:00."

01:08:13.130 --> 01:08:15.673
Mr. Hoover,
what are your exact qualifications...

01:08:15.841 --> 01:08:18.343
for your position of leadership
in this Bureau?

01:08:18.511 --> 01:08:19.761
My qualifications, sir?

01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:23.807
Nineteen years with the
Department of Justice. Nineteen.

01:08:23.974 --> 01:08:25.517
Twelve as director.

01:08:25.684 --> 01:08:29.312
In all that time,
you ever make an arrest yourself?

01:08:31.023 --> 01:08:35.443
I have made investigations.
I administer several cases at once.

01:08:36.612 --> 01:08:38.029
Well, that's not what I asked.

01:08:38.197 --> 01:08:42.867
The comic books show you with a machine
gun, making arrests. ls that just fiction?

01:08:49.834 --> 01:08:52.377
I am responsible for
thousands of arrests, sir.

01:08:53.587 --> 01:08:56.881
So you admit it is pure fiction.

01:08:57.466 --> 01:09:02.220
In fact, it wasn't you who hunted down
and captured John Dillinger at all.

01:09:02.513 --> 01:09:05.140
Lt was Agent Purvis. ls that correct?

01:09:06.392 --> 01:09:10.520
I was in charge of all of those
investigations...

01:09:10.854 --> 01:09:14.899
but, no, sir, I have not personally
made an arrest.

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:23.241
Any other questions, gentlemen?

01:09:24.243 --> 01:09:26.368
Let's bring it to a vote.

01:09:29.874 --> 01:09:31.332
Put those away.

01:09:36.421 --> 01:09:37.839
Well, that didn't go well.

01:09:38.006 --> 01:09:40.758
We spend our lives working
and we get a political attack?

01:09:40.926 --> 01:09:44.429
What does he expect, crimes to go
unsolved? Why is he fighting me?

01:09:44.596 --> 01:09:46.680
I want you to start a file
on Senator McKellar.

01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:48.640
I want four agents on him at all times.

01:09:48.809 --> 01:09:51.769
I want to know what's in his trash,
photograph him at dinner.

01:09:51.937 --> 01:09:55.607
Don't get in the car. You can walk back.

01:09:55.774 --> 01:09:58.276
We have lunch.
We don't miss lunch, no matter what.

01:09:58.444 --> 01:10:00.278
You pulled away from me in there.

01:10:00.446 --> 01:10:03.781
You perjured yourself, Edgar,
and the lie was an easily provable one.

01:10:03.949 --> 01:10:05.950
There's no telling
how much worse it could've been.

01:10:06.118 --> 01:10:09.996
Find Agent Purvis. He is to be
demoted immediately or, better yet, fired.

01:10:10.164 --> 01:10:12.832
Firing the man who killed John Dillinger
would be a PR disaster.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.251
Then he is to spend the rest of his career
behind a desk.

01:10:15.419 --> 01:10:19.339
And if he'd like to keep that job,
he'd best stay out of the papers. Go.

01:10:29.225 --> 01:10:32.060
I don't know who I can trust anymore.

01:10:33.896 --> 01:10:34.979
Only you.

01:10:37.483 --> 01:10:38.942
Only you, Mother.

01:10:39.652 --> 01:10:43.154
You're all I have to keep me safe,
you understand that?

01:10:44.198 --> 01:10:46.407
Please, Mother,
let me take you to a doctor.

01:10:46.575 --> 01:10:49.619
A simple examination isn't unholy, is it?

01:10:51.497 --> 01:10:52.538
Mother.

01:10:54.833 --> 01:10:55.959
Mother, please.

01:10:58.837 --> 01:11:01.172
Faith, Edgar.

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:03.258
Faith.

01:11:04.843 --> 01:11:07.637
Don't wilt like a little flower.

01:11:08.347 --> 01:11:09.722
Be strong.

01:11:10.766 --> 01:11:12.267
Yes, Mother.

01:11:14.645 --> 01:11:16.245
I will.

01:11:24.113 --> 01:11:28.157
If what Congress valued more
than wits and brains was muscle...

01:11:28.325 --> 01:11:31.411
if what they hungered for
was an armed American hero...

01:11:31.578 --> 01:11:35.373
then I was willing to risk my very life
and give them both.

01:11:35.541 --> 01:11:36.708
Move.

01:11:36.875 --> 01:11:38.167
Go.

01:11:38.335 --> 01:11:39.627
Hold it, government agents!

01:11:54.518 --> 01:11:56.686
The arrest is mine to make!

01:11:57.396 --> 01:11:58.396
Move.

01:11:58.564 --> 01:12:01.024
Mr. Karpis, you are under arrest.

01:12:02.234 --> 01:12:06.029
Mr. Hoover himself.
I'm gonna be famous.

01:12:06.905 --> 01:12:08.698
Put the handcuffs on him.

01:12:13.662 --> 01:12:15.705
Don't move, Mr. Mahan.

01:12:16.749 --> 01:12:18.166
Blow it down.

01:12:21.879 --> 01:12:22.920
Move.

01:12:34.725 --> 01:12:37.101
Mr. Brunette, you are under arrest.

01:12:37.269 --> 01:12:41.564
Alvin Karpis said he couldn't be taken alive,
but we took him without firing a shot.

01:12:41.732 --> 01:12:45.568
And let me tell you, he shook all over.
His voice, his hands, and his knees.

01:12:45.736 --> 01:12:48.780
You arrested Harry Campbell in Toledo
and Brunette in Manhattan?

01:12:48.947 --> 01:12:50.448
And William Mahan in California.

01:12:50.657 --> 01:12:53.159
But let me clarify
without a shadow of a doubt...

01:12:53.327 --> 01:12:55.912
this was a "we" job, not an "I" job.

01:13:02.711 --> 01:13:05.463
Edgar, look at this.
We made the Post Toasties box.

01:13:06.465 --> 01:13:09.801
"Melvin Purvis,
the FBI agent that caught Dillinger."

01:13:10.511 --> 01:13:12.303
Write the cereal-maker.
Let them know...

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:15.640
Oh. "Junior G-Man." Hmm.

01:13:15.808 --> 01:13:20.978
Tell them they ought to print any further
boxes to read "former agent of the FBI."

01:13:21.647 --> 01:13:23.564
Sit down, Clyde.
I'm gonna read something.

01:13:27.986 --> 01:13:29.779
"Only eight more days.

01:13:29.947 --> 01:13:32.990
Funny how even the dearest face
will fade away in time.

01:13:33.158 --> 01:13:34.867
Most clearly, I remember your eyes...

01:13:35.035 --> 01:13:39.247
with a sort of teasing smile in them,
and the feeling of that soft spot...

01:13:39.415 --> 01:13:43.000
just northeast of the corner
of your mouth against my lips."

01:13:43.168 --> 01:13:44.585
What is it?

01:13:44.753 --> 01:13:46.379
Lt's a letter from Lorena Hickok...

01:13:46.547 --> 01:13:50.633
the White House reporter with
the bad breath, to Mrs. Roosevelt.

01:13:51.301 --> 01:13:54.178
No. What are you gonna do with it?

01:13:54.346 --> 01:13:56.931
Nothing. I accused her
of having an affair with a man...

01:13:57.099 --> 01:14:00.017
and Old Horse Face is having
an affair with Mrs. Bat Breath!

01:14:01.353 --> 01:14:03.771
- A woman! Can you believe it?
- Mm.

01:14:08.193 --> 01:14:11.362
Oh, excuse me, Mr. Hoover.
They'd like to see you in the laboratory.

01:14:11.530 --> 01:14:14.782
Yes, Miss Gandy. You tell them
I'll be there in one minute. Thank you.

01:14:15.033 --> 01:14:16.200
We'll get to this later.

01:14:16.827 --> 01:14:21.497
Speaking of horses, Clyde,
I'm going to Del Mar this weekend.

01:14:22.332 --> 01:14:24.333
I was thinking of taking
a quick vacation...

01:14:24.501 --> 01:14:27.670
and, well,
I thought you'd like to join me.

01:14:27.838 --> 01:14:30.047
Well, I've never been
to the horse races, Edgar.

01:14:30.215 --> 01:14:31.299
Well, it's wonderful.

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:36.721
And between me and you, when I lose,
the track, they actually cover the losses.

01:14:36.889 --> 01:14:40.558
- So, what happens if you win?
- They still pay.

01:14:40.726 --> 01:14:41.809
Then where's the thrill?

01:14:41.977 --> 01:14:45.855
In the sun that falls on the stands,
the hotel rooms, the service...

01:14:46.023 --> 01:14:49.400
the restaurants, but, most of all,
Clyde, it's the company.

01:14:51.069 --> 01:14:53.154
- Come with me.
- I'd love to.

01:14:53.322 --> 01:14:56.491
Fantastic. I'll have Miss Gandy
make all the arrangements.

01:14:56.658 --> 01:14:59.911
Well, I can't go now. But maybe
in a couple months after I've saved up.

01:15:00.078 --> 01:15:03.414
- lt's completely covered, Clyde.
- Edgar, I can't let you do that.

01:15:03.582 --> 01:15:07.835
Listen, you've done so much for me,
for this Bureau. Consider it a thank you.

01:15:08.003 --> 01:15:10.171
I don't know that I'd feel comfortable.

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:14.217
I'll get a suite with adjoining rooms...

01:15:14.384 --> 01:15:17.887
rather than having us stay separate.
That'll be savings enough.

01:15:18.347 --> 01:15:19.388
Deal.

01:15:20.182 --> 01:15:21.933
What do you have for me, Mr. Koehler?

01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:25.436
Well, as you can see, ahem,
there are several kinds of wood here.

01:15:25.604 --> 01:15:29.941
Pine, birch, fir, and, if you look closely,
you will see...

01:15:30.108 --> 01:15:31.275
- Thank you.
- Mr. Tolson.

01:15:31.443 --> 01:15:35.112
That each has its own internal markings,
rings and knots...

01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:39.116
and its own external markings from the
machinery used to mill the raw timber...

01:15:39.284 --> 01:15:42.703
and these that mark the tools
used to build the ladder.

01:15:42.871 --> 01:15:46.958
The question is, how does this help us
identify the kidnappers, Mr. Koehler?

01:15:47.125 --> 01:15:48.751
I need more money, sir.

01:15:48.919 --> 01:15:51.420
- More money, sir, for what?
- Postage.

01:15:51.588 --> 01:15:54.090
I need to write every mill
on the East Coast...

01:15:54.258 --> 01:15:57.635
and see if their blades
match these marks.

01:15:57.803 --> 01:15:59.178
Hmm.

01:15:59.638 --> 01:16:02.807
I want a report from each mill
and a map tracking all leads.

01:16:02.975 --> 01:16:06.310
By the time I get back from New York,
I want something to report.

01:16:06.478 --> 01:16:07.645
Good day.

01:16:16.655 --> 01:16:18.823
Just like the communist radicals
before them...

01:16:18.991 --> 01:16:20.491
the gangster fell from favor.

01:16:20.659 --> 01:16:24.829
Now, finally, children dreamed
of joining the FBI.

01:16:33.088 --> 01:16:35.590
On your feet. On your feet.

01:16:39.928 --> 01:16:40.970
Yeah?

01:16:41.763 --> 01:16:43.931
He's taking his shower. Any message?

01:16:44.099 --> 01:16:46.517
There ain't any shower there, copper.

01:16:59.698 --> 01:17:00.865
Miss Temple!

01:17:01.033 --> 01:17:04.744
Mr. Hoover, I was wondering
if you would join my police force.

01:17:04.911 --> 01:17:06.287
Why, yes, Miss Temple.

01:17:06.455 --> 01:17:10.666
If you agree to be an honorary G-Woman,
and give me one little kiss.

01:17:11.501 --> 01:17:14.045
I don't know if your wife would approve,
Mr. Hoover.

01:17:15.631 --> 01:17:17.798
But, you see,
I still live with my mother.

01:17:18.884 --> 01:17:21.469
Oh. Okay.

01:17:21.637 --> 01:17:23.888
- Look this way!
- That's real spiffy.

01:17:24.056 --> 01:17:26.015
Nice smile. Thank you very much.

01:17:29.311 --> 01:17:31.228
Excuse me, sir. Can we get a statement?

01:17:31.396 --> 01:17:32.980
How'd you like the picture?

01:17:35.025 --> 01:17:36.233
This way, Mr. Hoover!

01:17:36.401 --> 01:17:37.777
After you, Mother.

01:17:50.415 --> 01:17:52.249
Should we go to the club?

01:17:52.918 --> 01:17:55.670
After we drop Mother off at the hotel.

01:18:15.649 --> 01:18:18.150
I have you at a table with Anita Colby.

01:18:19.069 --> 01:18:22.363
Lela Rogers and her daughter Ginger
have asked if they can join.

01:18:22.531 --> 01:18:24.073
As long as it's near the front.

01:18:24.241 --> 01:18:27.284
Miss Rogers, pleasure to meet you.
This must be your mother.

01:18:27.452 --> 01:18:28.452
Hello.

01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:31.580
J. Edgar Hoover. This is Clyde Tolson.
Anita, good to see you.

01:18:40.215 --> 01:18:42.133
The bullet entered
the back of the head...

01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:44.760
and exited through the front
near his cheek.

01:18:44.928 --> 01:18:48.305
The thing that most people don't
realize is that there is little blood.

01:18:48.473 --> 01:18:52.143
The heat from the bullet actually
seals the wound as it enters...

01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:57.106
so the crime scene is far more peaceful
than is depicted in your moving pictures.

01:18:57.274 --> 01:19:00.651
And little Lindy.
Did you see the child with your own eyes?

01:19:01.486 --> 01:19:03.529
Those are details I wouldn't disclose...

01:19:03.697 --> 01:19:06.365
with a refined group of women
such as yourselves.

01:19:06.533 --> 01:19:12.413
I couldn't bear to make you shed a tear.
But I assure you this, we are on the case.

01:19:12.581 --> 01:19:15.666
I saw the Lindberghs in Paris.
I hardly recognized them.

01:19:15.834 --> 01:19:16.834
Hmm.

01:19:17.002 --> 01:19:20.171
Only justice can bring reason
back to their lives.

01:19:20.672 --> 01:19:25.134
But I might share one confidential
clue with you, if you swear to secrecy.

01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:27.845
Of course.

01:19:28.013 --> 01:19:30.473
The gold notes from
the ransom money have surfaced.

01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:32.349
And can you guess where?

01:19:32.517 --> 01:19:34.018
Tell us. Please, Mr. Hoover.

01:19:34.186 --> 01:19:36.395
In the Bronx, on three occasions.

01:19:36.563 --> 01:19:38.439
And each one of the shop owners claim...

01:19:38.607 --> 01:19:42.860
they received them from a man with
a pointed chin and a German accent.

01:19:45.363 --> 01:19:48.199
Take my word for it, Mr. Hoover.

01:19:48.366 --> 01:19:51.202
All the admiration in the world
can't fill the spot love goes.

01:19:51.369 --> 01:19:52.411
Hmm.

01:19:52.579 --> 01:19:54.205
Or keep your bed warm.

01:19:56.708 --> 01:19:58.584
I serve my country, Miss Colby.

01:19:58.752 --> 01:20:01.796
The nation's admiration
is more than enough for me. Heh.

01:20:02.464 --> 01:20:05.216
But it likely makes for a cold bed.

01:20:06.718 --> 01:20:10.179
Mr. Hoover, would it be out of the question
to bother you for a dance?

01:20:10.347 --> 01:20:12.223
Oh, uh, how do you mean?

01:20:13.475 --> 01:20:15.309
Well, simply a dance.

01:20:15.602 --> 01:20:17.311
You do dance, don't you?

01:20:17.479 --> 01:20:20.981
Well, that is a skill
that, um, I haven't yet mastered.

01:20:21.191 --> 01:20:24.318
And the night is getting long,
isn't it, Mr. Tolson? Mr. Tolson?

01:20:24.486 --> 01:20:27.196
No time like the present.
Lt's my favorite song, come on.

01:20:27.364 --> 01:20:29.865
Lt's time we leave.
Uh, we have a great deal of work.

01:20:30.033 --> 01:20:32.243
We... We...
We have a great deal of work tomorrow...

01:20:32.410 --> 01:20:36.163
and I'm afraid we don't have time
to dance. We're very busy, aren't we?

01:20:36.331 --> 01:20:37.623
Yes.

01:20:37.791 --> 01:20:40.084
And my sincere apologies. I...

01:20:40.252 --> 01:20:42.211
Right now, Mr. Tolson.
Thank you very much.

01:20:42.379 --> 01:20:43.838
- Good evening.
- Ha, ha.

01:20:44.005 --> 01:20:45.256
Good night.

01:20:49.302 --> 01:20:50.511
I don't...

01:20:51.263 --> 01:20:52.304
I...

01:20:52.472 --> 01:20:55.266
I don't... I don't like to...
I don't like to dance, Mother.

01:20:55.433 --> 01:20:58.394
- I don't like to da...
- Edgar, go look in the mirror.

01:20:58.562 --> 01:21:01.689
Talk the way the doctor taught you to.
Be my little Speedy.

01:21:12.784 --> 01:21:14.952
I can spit my words out with... With...

01:21:16.371 --> 01:21:19.790
I can spit my words out with precision,
diction, and clarity.

01:21:19.958 --> 01:21:24.461
I can sp... Spit my words out with
precision, diction, and clarity.

01:21:26.423 --> 01:21:32.386
I'm a proficient, remarkable lad,
capable of remarkable feats.

01:21:32.554 --> 01:21:35.472
I'm a profic... Mother.
Mother, I don't like to dance.

01:21:36.641 --> 01:21:39.393
Mostly I don't like to dance with women.

01:21:39.561 --> 01:21:41.520
I think it's time you knew this.

01:21:41.688 --> 01:21:44.315
And I find it humiliating
and I refuse to be humiliated.

01:21:44.482 --> 01:21:46.650
Edgar, stop.

01:21:47.986 --> 01:21:49.486
Do you remember Barton Pincus?

01:21:51.197 --> 01:21:52.781
Yes, Mother.

01:21:52.949 --> 01:21:54.992
His father was a watchmaker.

01:21:55.660 --> 01:21:58.871
He was 10 years younger than me
and you used to call him...

01:22:00.790 --> 01:22:03.834
Birdy or Daffy
or something to that effect.

01:22:04.002 --> 01:22:06.503
And do you remember
what happened to Daffy?

01:22:06.671 --> 01:22:10.841
After the school custodian discovered him
in a hoop skirt and flower bonnet?

01:22:13.011 --> 01:22:15.512
He was made to stand outside
in front of the school...

01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:18.849
wearing the bonnet and skirt
as punishment.

01:22:19.559 --> 01:22:22.019
Did you ever wonder why
we called him Daffy?

01:22:23.229 --> 01:22:26.857
For his odd behavior, I believe.

01:22:28.068 --> 01:22:30.736
Lt's short for "daffodil," Edgar.

01:22:32.530 --> 01:22:34.990
Do you remember what happened
to Daffodil Pincus?

01:22:36.618 --> 01:22:38.035
Yes, Mother. He...

01:22:39.204 --> 01:22:41.080
He shot himself six weeks after.

01:22:41.247 --> 01:22:42.289
That's right.

01:22:43.208 --> 01:22:47.211
And I thank God every day that my own
sons don't suffer from his condition.

01:22:48.213 --> 01:22:49.463
Edgar.

01:22:51.424 --> 01:22:54.551
I'd rather have a dead son
than a daffodil for a son.

01:22:59.391 --> 01:23:02.726
And now, I'm gonna teach you to dance.

01:23:06.773 --> 01:23:08.148
Yes, Mother.

01:23:42.976 --> 01:23:45.436
- Bring this right over here, please.
- Sure, sir.

01:23:46.271 --> 01:23:49.773
All right. Now, when did you get
this shipment?

01:23:50.483 --> 01:23:54.778
Lt's a long while back.
I'm thinking, uh, November 1931.

01:23:55.822 --> 01:23:57.823
Three months before the kidnapping.

01:23:59.325 --> 01:24:00.701
All right. Thank you.

01:24:00.910 --> 01:24:04.371
The lumberyard is a cash business,
there aren't any receipts or names.

01:24:04.539 --> 01:24:07.416
Lt tells us where he was shopping
before we were looking.

01:24:07.584 --> 01:24:10.461
Show me the addresses of where
the ransom bills have shown up.

01:24:10.628 --> 01:24:13.047
Lt's 456 West Third.

01:24:13.631 --> 01:24:16.008
And 476 West Third.

01:24:17.302 --> 01:24:18.802
And down the street right here.

01:24:22.307 --> 01:24:24.641
We knew who we were looking for.

01:24:24.809 --> 01:24:27.978
Someone who'd done business
in this neighborhood for years.

01:24:28.146 --> 01:24:29.438
Someone who was still there.

01:24:29.606 --> 01:24:31.732
He was average height, blue eyes.

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:33.817
High cheekbones and a pointy chin.

01:24:33.985 --> 01:24:38.155
Yes, sir, a pointed chin
and an accent, like a...

01:24:38.323 --> 01:24:39.990
German accent, maybe?

01:24:40.158 --> 01:24:42.826
A German with big cheekbones.

01:24:43.661 --> 01:24:46.288
Am I, uh, going to get him
in some kind of trouble?

01:24:46.456 --> 01:24:50.834
Not if he didn't do anything wrong.
We're the FBI, son. We're the good guys.

01:24:52.504 --> 01:24:54.838
Lt was deposited by Walter Lyle.

01:24:55.006 --> 01:24:59.176
He manages the gas station
up on Lexington and 127th.

01:24:59.344 --> 01:25:00.969
Walter Lyle?

01:25:01.429 --> 01:25:03.138
You remember the man
that paid with this?

01:25:03.306 --> 01:25:05.766
Yes, I remember him.
He bought 89 cents worth of gas.

01:25:05.934 --> 01:25:08.685
And he paid with this bill?

01:25:08.853 --> 01:25:11.772
Yes, sir. But I don't know him.
I haven't seen him since.

01:25:12.273 --> 01:25:15.025
You would remember him
if he came in again?

01:25:15.193 --> 01:25:18.529
Yeah, he was German, I think,
I mean, with an accent and pointed chin.

01:25:18.696 --> 01:25:21.365
- High cheekbones, right?
- Yeah. I looked at the bill funny.

01:25:21.533 --> 01:25:24.034
He assured me he had
a hundred more like it at home.

01:25:24.202 --> 01:25:25.661
You had a conversation with him?

01:25:26.496 --> 01:25:27.663
No, that was it.

01:25:28.581 --> 01:25:29.623
Thank you, Mr. Lyle.

01:25:29.791 --> 01:25:32.501
I wrote down the license plate number.

01:25:33.378 --> 01:25:35.587
That's the writing
along the edge of the bill.

01:25:38.133 --> 01:25:39.216
Let's go.

01:25:45.890 --> 01:25:48.100
Miss Gandy, get Mr. Tolson.

01:25:57.068 --> 01:25:58.235
Agent Sisk.

01:25:58.403 --> 01:26:02.114
The New York Motor Vehicles Bureau
describes it as a blue 1930 Dodge sedan.

01:26:02.282 --> 01:26:04.241
The owner is a carpenter
born in Germany...

01:26:04.409 --> 01:26:08.745
lives at 1279 East 222nd Street
in the Bronx.

01:26:08.913 --> 01:26:10.581
His name is Bruno Richard Hauptmann.

01:26:22.135 --> 01:26:23.218
Let's move.

01:26:23.386 --> 01:26:25.596
On September 19th, 1934...

01:26:25.763 --> 01:26:28.599
before we could arrest
the most wanted man in America...

01:26:28.766 --> 01:26:33.020
he'd been pulled over by a local cop
for a broken tail light.

01:26:33.188 --> 01:26:34.438
Can't believe this.

01:26:36.858 --> 01:26:38.025
Pull over.

01:26:46.618 --> 01:26:47.868
FBI, put your hands up!

01:26:48.036 --> 01:26:49.912
- Put them up!
- Ls there a problem?

01:26:50.079 --> 01:26:52.456
Get out of the car!

01:27:02.508 --> 01:27:03.550
Bruno Hauptmann...

01:27:03.718 --> 01:27:07.638
you are under arrest for the kidnapping
and murder of Charles Lindbergh, Jr.

01:27:07.805 --> 01:27:09.932
Cuff him, boys.

01:27:15.313 --> 01:27:17.314
We finally had him.

01:27:17.482 --> 01:27:20.651
Now we had to convict,
but unlike trials of the past...

01:27:20.818 --> 01:27:26.114
we now had forensics,
expert witnesses, and facts.

01:27:30.328 --> 01:27:31.578
We need a title, Agent Garrison.

01:27:32.956 --> 01:27:34.331
Right away, Mr. Hoover.

01:27:36.376 --> 01:27:38.168
We are working, Miss Gandy.

01:27:38.336 --> 01:27:39.878
The tape came in.

01:27:40.505 --> 01:27:42.756
Bring it to my private office.

01:27:43.841 --> 01:27:45.842
That'll be all for now, Agent Garrison.

01:28:03.278 --> 01:28:05.988
I just have to say...

01:28:06.155 --> 01:28:09.574
you looked so beautiful
sitting across that bar.

01:28:09.742 --> 01:28:11.535
I saw you watching me.

01:28:11.703 --> 01:28:13.578
I have to admit I was watching you...

01:28:13.746 --> 01:28:15.122
for a long time.

01:28:19.627 --> 01:28:20.961
Slow down a little bit.

01:28:21.129 --> 01:28:22.170
All right.

01:28:24.424 --> 01:28:26.049
Let me take this off.

01:28:26.676 --> 01:28:28.051
Turn around.

01:28:30.722 --> 01:28:31.972
You got it?

01:28:54.203 --> 01:28:56.580
Miss Gandy, I told you
I am not to be disturbed.

01:28:56.748 --> 01:28:58.373
I'm sorry. Mr. Hoover?

01:28:58.541 --> 01:29:02.169
Yes, it's urgent. I have Agent Shanklin
on the line from Dallas.

01:29:02.337 --> 01:29:03.920
My apologies, Mr. Hoover.

01:29:04.088 --> 01:29:05.630
I told Miss Gandy to put me through.

01:29:05.798 --> 01:29:08.091
What is it, Agent Shanklin?

01:29:08.551 --> 01:29:11.636
Sir, the president has been shot.

01:29:13.639 --> 01:29:15.015
Who else knows about this?

01:29:15.183 --> 01:29:18.643
No one, sir. I thought you should know
before the press reports it.

01:29:19.771 --> 01:29:22.064
- Thank you, Agent Shanklin.
- Yes, sir.

01:29:29.530 --> 01:29:31.948
Oh, that feels so good.

01:29:58.059 --> 01:30:00.644
Get me Robert Kennedy immediately.

01:30:07.193 --> 01:30:08.485
Mr. Hoover?

01:30:09.112 --> 01:30:12.739
Mr. Kennedy,
the president has been shot.

01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:15.242
What?

01:30:15.785 --> 01:30:17.828
Mr. Hoover? What?

01:30:20.498 --> 01:30:21.832
Mr. Hoover?

01:30:32.844 --> 01:30:34.886
Lt's Frosty Mountain in front...

01:30:35.054 --> 01:30:36.138
by a length and a half.

01:30:36.305 --> 01:30:38.682
That's Jazz third by six.

01:30:38.850 --> 01:30:43.395
Slapjack's fourth, final head.
Popstar Morell three quarters.

01:30:43.563 --> 01:30:48.358
Turning for home, Frosty Mountain under the
left by a fraction and a length and a half.

01:30:48.526 --> 01:30:51.570
Number five. He's gaining on them.

01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:54.656
It's Frosty Mountain, now.

01:30:56.159 --> 01:30:58.368
I'm not sure if I bet on that one.

01:30:58.536 --> 01:31:01.705
Ah. We lost again, Clyde.

01:31:01.914 --> 01:31:04.332
Dextro back by a half-length on the rail.

01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:07.586
Dextro now making his move.
Findlay gives him the whip.

01:31:07.753 --> 01:31:09.504
Oh, there he goes, there he goes!

01:31:09.672 --> 01:31:11.548
Come on, Dextro, come on, Dextro!

01:31:56.511 --> 01:31:58.845
- Did you see his shoes?
- Ha, ha.

01:31:59.138 --> 01:32:00.222
Desi Arnaz?

01:32:00.389 --> 01:32:03.892
You mean the crocodile ones
with the horrible buckles across the top?

01:32:04.060 --> 01:32:05.602
No, I didn't notice them one bit.

01:32:05.770 --> 01:32:08.438
You'd think with their money
they'd have a bit of fashion sense...

01:32:08.606 --> 01:32:10.857
Ha, ha.
- ...or at least pay someone to have it.

01:32:11.025 --> 01:32:12.609
Oh, and his faux-ginger wife.

01:32:12.777 --> 01:32:17.364
When she walked in, I thought a hunter
was gonna pull a rifle on that hat of hers.

01:32:18.741 --> 01:32:20.575
lt was like this, you see, like...

01:32:20.743 --> 01:32:22.786
Ha-ha-ha. That's right, with the feathers.

01:32:26.541 --> 01:32:29.543
You know, I care so very much
for you, Clyde. I do.

01:32:31.837 --> 01:32:34.214
And I love you, Edgar.

01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:43.723
ls everything okay?

01:32:43.891 --> 01:32:45.141
Yes, yes, I'm fine.

01:32:45.810 --> 01:32:47.060
I'm fine.

01:32:50.481 --> 01:32:53.817
I've been meaning
to ask you something, Clyde.

01:32:53.985 --> 01:32:54.985
Anything.

01:32:57.321 --> 01:33:01.074
What do you think of Dorothy Lamour,
the actress?

01:33:01.659 --> 01:33:03.285
With Rudy Vallee at the Stork Club?

01:33:03.452 --> 01:33:05.328
Yes. That's the one.

01:33:05.496 --> 01:33:08.623
She's a little camp for me, but, heh...

01:33:11.711 --> 01:33:14.963
Well, I've been thinking of taking her up
on a proposal is all.

01:33:16.173 --> 01:33:17.173
For dinner?

01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:19.634
No, no, not dinner.

01:33:20.678 --> 01:33:22.554
We've been to dinner several times now.

01:33:24.015 --> 01:33:25.056
When?

01:33:26.934 --> 01:33:29.603
Oh, in New York, when I've gone up
on the weekends.

01:33:32.523 --> 01:33:33.607
I see.

01:33:36.068 --> 01:33:40.655
I suppose what I'm... What I'm trying
to say here, Clyde, is, well...

01:33:43.409 --> 01:33:45.910
I think it may be
time for a Mrs. Hoover.

01:33:53.669 --> 01:33:56.338
What, you don't like her? ls that it?

01:33:57.715 --> 01:33:59.841
Don't you make a fool of me, Edgar.

01:34:00.009 --> 01:34:03.011
I'm not, Clyde,
I'm not making a fool of you.

01:34:05.306 --> 01:34:08.016
Have you...? Have you become physical?

01:34:10.811 --> 01:34:12.020
Yes, we have.

01:34:13.064 --> 01:34:14.314
What is it, Clyde?

01:34:14.482 --> 01:34:19.069
Do you want me to be half a person?
Remain incomplete, is that what you want?

01:34:20.529 --> 01:34:22.739
ls that what I am to you, incompletion?

01:34:23.282 --> 01:34:25.075
Clyde, pick that glass up immediately!

01:34:25.242 --> 01:34:27.827
No, I will not! I have no reason to!

01:34:27.995 --> 01:34:30.747
I refuse! So, go on, fire me.

01:34:30.915 --> 01:34:32.207
Do it. Now!

01:34:32.375 --> 01:34:34.918
Get a hold of yourself.
You're acting like a fool!

01:34:35.086 --> 01:34:36.920
- Agh!
- Stop this!

01:34:37.088 --> 01:34:39.589
Clyde! You have no shoes on,
for God's sakes!

01:34:39.757 --> 01:34:42.425
No. No, I will not!
I won't even listen to you!

01:34:42.593 --> 01:34:45.428
You will never tell me what to do!
You just lost that right!

01:34:45.596 --> 01:34:47.347
- Stop it!
- I see right through you!

01:34:47.515 --> 01:34:50.767
You're a scared, heartless,
horrible little man!

01:34:50.935 --> 01:34:52.435
- Unh! Don't you dare!
- Unh!

01:35:30.516 --> 01:35:32.434
Don't you ever do that again.

01:35:34.145 --> 01:35:35.186
I won't.

01:35:37.648 --> 01:35:39.315
Cly...

01:35:40.985 --> 01:35:42.694
Clyde, where are you going?

01:35:43.112 --> 01:35:46.573
Clyde, please. Clyde, don't leave me!

01:35:46.741 --> 01:35:47.907
Clyde, please.

01:35:48.075 --> 01:35:49.826
Clyde, I'm sorry!

01:35:49.994 --> 01:35:51.828
Clyde, please don't leave me!

01:35:51.996 --> 01:35:53.163
Clyde, I'm begging you!

01:35:53.330 --> 01:35:57.834
I'm begging you, Clyde! Clyde, please.

01:35:58.002 --> 01:36:00.211
After all...

01:36:03.758 --> 01:36:09.637
After all, we have another day of races.

01:36:17.104 --> 01:36:20.607
If you ever mention a lady friend again...

01:36:20.775 --> 01:36:23.777
it will be the last time
that you share my company.

01:36:35.956 --> 01:36:37.624
Love you, Clyde.

01:36:39.668 --> 01:36:40.835
Love you.

01:36:45.216 --> 01:36:47.717
Mr. Meter looks promising.

01:37:02.566 --> 01:37:04.901
- Unh. Ugh.
- What is it, Clyde?

01:37:05.069 --> 01:37:06.611
Clyde?

01:37:06.779 --> 01:37:08.154
Someone get a doctor.

01:37:08.322 --> 01:37:09.489
Clyde.

01:37:09.657 --> 01:37:13.576
Someone get a doctor now!
Someone get a doctor!

01:37:13.744 --> 01:37:16.079
Clyde, look at me. Look at me.

01:37:16.831 --> 01:37:19.415
Someone get a doctor now!

01:37:19.583 --> 01:37:21.084
Help!

01:37:21.252 --> 01:37:23.086
He'll recover most of his function...

01:37:23.254 --> 01:37:26.256
but a stroke like this,
it will limit the hours he can work...

01:37:26.423 --> 01:37:28.007
the information he can process.

01:37:28.175 --> 01:37:29.884
Are you okay, Mr. Hoover?

01:37:30.594 --> 01:37:34.097
Yes, I'm fine. I just... I was playing
with my dog in the yard on Saturday.

01:37:34.265 --> 01:37:36.266
Perhaps it's dehydration.

01:37:37.101 --> 01:37:40.228
That could do it, but it may be wise
to reduce your hours as well.

01:37:40.396 --> 01:37:42.564
At your age, it's important to take leave.

01:37:43.482 --> 01:37:46.484
Miss Gandy, please, give us some privacy.

01:37:51.782 --> 01:37:55.159
Let me tell you, if you ever denigrate me
in front of my staff again...

01:37:55.369 --> 01:37:58.288
I'll have you railroaded out of your
profession. Understand?

01:37:59.456 --> 01:38:00.623
I apologize, sir.

01:38:01.458 --> 01:38:02.876
Tell me something.

01:38:03.294 --> 01:38:05.128
What do you have for energy?

01:38:05.296 --> 01:38:08.631
We have diet medications
which tend to give a boost.

01:38:08.799 --> 01:38:12.302
So I could lose a few pounds
and have more energy as well?

01:38:12.469 --> 01:38:15.305
Wouldn't worry about your weight, sir.
Lt's solid weight.

01:38:15.514 --> 01:38:16.931
Hmm.

01:38:17.474 --> 01:38:18.975
Schedule a daily visit.

01:38:20.519 --> 01:38:21.686
Yes, sir.

01:38:30.487 --> 01:38:34.157
They're giving King the Nobel Prize.
Can you believe it?

01:38:34.325 --> 01:38:37.327
The degenerates and radicals
are being lifted up internationally.

01:38:37.494 --> 01:38:40.663
Lt's like it's 1920 all over again.

01:38:40.998 --> 01:38:42.165
Don't.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.627
When he finds out
that we have this audiotape...

01:38:45.794 --> 01:38:48.004
that we know the truth
about his character...

01:38:48.172 --> 01:38:51.507
he's going to decline the award,
Clyde, believe me.

01:38:51.967 --> 01:38:54.052
President Johnson...

01:38:54.219 --> 01:38:55.261
Wait.

01:38:55.846 --> 01:38:57.013
- Clyde.
- Wait.

01:38:57.181 --> 01:39:01.100
You're gonna have to learn to enunciate.
I can't seem to understand you.

01:39:01.268 --> 01:39:05.229
We have no legal tools.

01:39:05.439 --> 01:39:08.024
You see, our laws have not kept pace...

01:39:08.192 --> 01:39:10.860
with the improved tactics
of today's criminals.

01:39:11.028 --> 01:39:12.820
I'm gonna do this for you.

01:39:13.072 --> 01:39:15.365
What's your idea?

01:39:15.532 --> 01:39:18.201
Well, we have friends in the press, right?

01:39:18.369 --> 01:39:21.245
We plant stories with them to ensure...

01:39:21.455 --> 01:39:25.333
that the activities of suspected
radicals see the light of day.

01:39:26.001 --> 01:39:27.877
They'll trace it.

01:39:28.504 --> 01:39:30.213
Well, only if it's true.

01:39:31.006 --> 01:39:33.007
See, it's called counterintelligence,
Clyde.

01:39:33.175 --> 01:39:36.511
The more untrue the story,
the more dramatic the impact.

01:39:36.679 --> 01:39:39.681
Now, I'm going to send
the hotel recording...

01:39:39.848 --> 01:39:44.227
along with a personal letter
the day before he gets the Nobel Prize.

01:39:44.395 --> 01:39:48.398
And if he accepts the award,
we'll send the tape straight to the press.

01:39:50.025 --> 01:39:54.904
Are you sure that you want to be involved
with that kind of surveillance?

01:39:55.072 --> 01:39:57.615
Well, that's why the letter
won't be from me.

01:39:57.783 --> 01:40:00.243
It'll be a fictitious letter
from one of his own.

01:40:01.745 --> 01:40:07.333
Then there can be no room for error.
I'm not sure that we could ensu...

01:40:07.501 --> 01:40:11.087
I cannot understand what
you're saying, Clyde. Please.

01:40:11.255 --> 01:40:14.382
Come on now. Learn to speak up.

01:40:18.220 --> 01:40:22.598
Now, listen, I'm gonna need you
in the office tomorrow. No time to relent.

01:40:25.227 --> 01:40:26.769
I can't.

01:40:27.730 --> 01:40:29.063
Yes, you can.

01:40:29.815 --> 01:40:31.107
Now eat.

01:40:32.609 --> 01:40:36.654
You'd think after all this time
she'd be able to cook my egg correctly.

01:40:38.115 --> 01:40:40.283
What exactly are in these shots?

01:40:40.451 --> 01:40:41.701
Oh, it's just vitamins...

01:40:41.869 --> 01:40:43.619
a little extra pick-me-up.

01:40:56.341 --> 01:40:57.759
"Look into your heart.

01:40:57.926 --> 01:41:02.764
You know you are a complete fraud and a
great liability to all of us Negroes."

01:41:02.931 --> 01:41:06.309
I said "us," Miss Gandy, "us," not "the."

01:41:06.810 --> 01:41:08.269
You're a Negro now, sir?

01:41:08.437 --> 01:41:11.314
Write every word as I say it,
is that understood?

01:41:11.482 --> 01:41:14.984
Now, "White people in this country
have enough frauds of their own...

01:41:15.152 --> 01:41:17.153
but they do not
have one at this time...

01:41:17.321 --> 01:41:19.238
that is anywhere near your equal.

01:41:19.406 --> 01:41:22.325
- I repeat..."
- Sir, what is this exercise?

01:41:22.493 --> 01:41:26.662
Miss Gandy, I am not going to entertain
questions during my dictation, now write.

01:41:27.790 --> 01:41:32.752
"I repeat, you are a colossal fraud
and an evil, vicious one, at that!

01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:36.756
You do not believe in God. You do not
believe in any personal moral principles!"

01:41:36.924 --> 01:41:39.217
Sir, may I ask who this
will be addressed to...

01:41:39.384 --> 01:41:41.928
The question is not to whom,
Miss Gandy, not to whom...

01:41:42.096 --> 01:41:45.348
but from whom and it is not from
this office, is that understood?

01:41:45.516 --> 01:41:47.767
"You have turned out to be not a leader...

01:41:47.935 --> 01:41:51.437
but a dissolute, abnormal,
moral imbecile.

01:41:51.605 --> 01:41:54.357
There's only one thing left to do
and you know what that is.

01:41:54.525 --> 01:41:57.026
There's but one way out,
and you better take it...

01:41:57.194 --> 01:42:02.281
before your filthy, abnormal,
fraudulent self is bared to this nation."

01:42:02.449 --> 01:42:04.033
Did you get everything?

01:42:04.910 --> 01:42:07.203
- Edgar.
- Type it up.

01:42:08.247 --> 01:42:09.789
Type it up.

01:42:15.212 --> 01:42:18.381
I understand that you work for our
PR department, is that correct?

01:42:19.049 --> 01:42:20.716
For two years now, sir.

01:42:20.926 --> 01:42:24.095
Then you are familiar
with my earlier work...

01:42:24.263 --> 01:42:27.723
against Edward Clarke
and his Ku Klux Klan, are you not?

01:42:27.891 --> 01:42:29.058
Yes, sir.

01:42:29.226 --> 01:42:32.228
He was arrested for a violation
of the white slave traffic act...

01:42:32.396 --> 01:42:35.773
for crossing state lines
to have an affair with a white woman.

01:42:35.941 --> 01:42:36.983
Ls that correct, sir?

01:42:37.151 --> 01:42:41.237
That is correct. lt was the strongest law
at my disposal at the time.

01:42:41.405 --> 01:42:45.408
I'll have you know
that I'm very proud of that work.

01:42:45.576 --> 01:42:48.953
Miss Gandy told me that you stopped
with Bruno Hauptmann's arrest.

01:42:49.121 --> 01:42:52.415
- Would you like to start there?
- Yes, yes, I think we shall.

01:42:56.420 --> 01:42:58.212
Mr. Hauptmann was brought to trial...

01:42:58.380 --> 01:43:00.715
on January 2nd, 1935.

01:43:01.925 --> 01:43:06.262
H.L. Mencken called this
the biggest story since the resurrection.

01:43:06.430 --> 01:43:10.057
From the looks of things,
this may be bigger.

01:43:10.225 --> 01:43:12.643
Well, you see, no two saws
make the same markings.

01:43:12.811 --> 01:43:16.439
This saw from Bruno Hauptmann's
tool chest makes markings identical...

01:43:16.607 --> 01:43:19.400
to those found on the ladder
used in the crime.

01:43:19.568 --> 01:43:21.986
In the ransom note
and Mr. Hauptmann's writings...

01:43:22.154 --> 01:43:27.867
he wrote the word "anyding"
for "anything", uh, "gut" for "good"...

01:43:28.035 --> 01:43:32.538
"boad" for "boat,"
and notice the inverted capital N's.

01:43:32.706 --> 01:43:35.708
And the Y's that look like J's.

01:43:35.876 --> 01:43:37.960
Mr. Lindbergh, you
said you heard a voice...

01:43:38.128 --> 01:43:39.462
in the cemetery that night.

01:43:39.630 --> 01:43:41.881
Yes, very clearly.

01:43:42.049 --> 01:43:44.634
A voice,
to the best of my belief...

01:43:44.801 --> 01:43:48.471
calling Dr. Condon in a foreign accent.

01:43:48.639 --> 01:43:49.639
"Hey, doctor."

01:43:49.806 --> 01:43:50.848
Since that time...

01:43:51.016 --> 01:43:52.808
have you heard the same voice?

01:43:52.976 --> 01:43:54.477
Yes, l have.

01:43:54.645 --> 01:43:57.647
Whose voice was it that you heard
in the cemetery that night...

01:43:57.814 --> 01:43:59.649
saying, "Hey, doctor"?

01:43:59.816 --> 01:44:01.651
That was Hauptmann's voice.

01:44:04.154 --> 01:44:05.947
But did he act alone?

01:44:07.282 --> 01:44:11.202
He never confessed,
but what sociopath ever does?

01:44:11.370 --> 01:44:13.120
The evidence was clear.

01:44:13.288 --> 01:44:18.542
He was indicted for murder in the
first degree while perpetrating a burglary.

01:44:18.710 --> 01:44:22.004
In New Jersey,
that is punishable by death.

01:44:22.172 --> 01:44:23.381
Mr. Hauptmann...

01:44:23.548 --> 01:44:26.008
you've had an opportunity
in this courtroom today...

01:44:26.176 --> 01:44:28.219
to tell the whole truth.

01:44:28.387 --> 01:44:29.804
Have you told the truth?

01:44:29.972 --> 01:44:32.181
I told the truth already.

01:44:32.349 --> 01:44:33.432
And the statements...

01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:36.018
to District Attorney Foley.
Did you tell him the truth?

01:44:36.979 --> 01:44:38.271
To a certain extent.

01:44:38.438 --> 01:44:42.858
To a certain extent you didn't
tell him the truth. ls that right?

01:44:45.195 --> 01:44:49.949
This board that was found
in your closet, S-204...

01:44:50.117 --> 01:44:52.868
has these numbers written on it.

01:44:53.036 --> 01:44:54.870
Lt's a little blurred now, isn't it?

01:44:55.038 --> 01:44:56.330
Looks like it.

01:44:56.498 --> 01:44:59.292
Between are some words.
Lt looks like Decatur and Sedgwick.

01:44:59.459 --> 01:45:00.501
You see that?

01:45:02.296 --> 01:45:05.047
You know what that means, don't you?
That address on there?

01:45:06.049 --> 01:45:07.216
Not exactly.

01:45:08.593 --> 01:45:11.554
lt is the address and telephone number
of Dr. Condon...

01:45:11.722 --> 01:45:13.222
the man who paid the ransom...

01:45:13.390 --> 01:45:17.310
written in your writing,
found on a board in your closet.

01:45:17.477 --> 01:45:20.688
Mr. Hoover, the doctor's here to see you.

01:45:20.856 --> 01:45:22.982
Following Dr. King's historic speech...

01:45:23.150 --> 01:45:26.986
many said that day brought about a new
awakening in the conscience of the nation.

01:45:27.154 --> 01:45:29.572
Others called it a national disgrace.

01:45:29.740 --> 01:45:34.410
In the long history of man's cruelty
to man, this was a day of hope.

01:45:34.578 --> 01:45:35.995
L have a dream...

01:45:36.997 --> 01:45:39.457
that one day...

01:45:39.624 --> 01:45:43.336
this nation will rise up...

01:45:43.503 --> 01:45:46.172
and live out the true meaning
of its creeds.

01:45:47.090 --> 01:45:51.635
A man's legacy is determined by where
the story ends, Agent Owens.

01:45:51.803 --> 01:45:54.722
Let's think about that tonight
and make a decision tomorrow.

01:45:55.474 --> 01:45:56.891
Ls this about a man's legacy?

01:45:58.435 --> 01:46:00.269
Or an institution's reputation?

01:46:01.438 --> 01:46:03.272
The two are connected, Agent Owens.

01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:05.941
One invented the other and vice versa.

01:46:06.109 --> 01:46:07.943
Good day to you.

01:46:09.404 --> 01:46:10.946
Yes, sir.

01:46:11.114 --> 01:46:14.492
We the jury find the defendant,
Bruno Richard Hauptmann...

01:46:14.659 --> 01:46:16.535
guilty of murder in the first degree.

01:46:27.798 --> 01:46:30.716
Your Honor,
l ask for immediate sentencing.

01:46:33.804 --> 01:46:37.431
According to the law of this state...

01:46:37.599 --> 01:46:40.893
l rule that Mr. Bruno Hauptmann
suffer death...

01:46:41.061 --> 01:46:46.649
at the time and place
and in the manner provided by law.

01:46:54.825 --> 01:46:56.826
lt's death for Hauptmann!

01:47:02.165 --> 01:47:03.499
The trial of the century...

01:47:03.667 --> 01:47:08.462
the criminal shamed,
the FBI cemented as the public hero.

01:47:08.630 --> 01:47:11.257
That's our, that's our ending, agent.

01:47:13.510 --> 01:47:15.177
But did he do it alone?

01:47:15.554 --> 01:47:18.472
Ls he the one who actually took the child?
How can you be sure?

01:47:19.724 --> 01:47:23.644
Well, the mountain of evidence
we discovered, uncovered...

01:47:23.812 --> 01:47:26.689
confirmed, and clarified,
you cannot dispute it.

01:47:26.857 --> 01:47:29.316
- Clarence Darrow did.
- Of course. Heh.

01:47:30.193 --> 01:47:32.194
Of course, Agent Owens.
That's what he does.

01:47:32.362 --> 01:47:34.905
Mrs. Roosevelt issued
a statement questioning his guilt.

01:47:35.073 --> 01:47:40.202
Well, she has enough to hide on her own
when it comes to un-American activities.

01:47:42.747 --> 01:47:46.375
Well, if you're comfortable with it
as an ending, I'll do my best with it.

01:47:47.127 --> 01:47:50.129
Yes. Yes, l am.

01:47:50.839 --> 01:47:52.339
Sir.

01:47:56.928 --> 01:47:58.053
Watch this with me.

01:47:58.221 --> 01:48:01.056
He received my letter
and the audio tape last night.

01:48:01.224 --> 01:48:03.225
President Johnson affixes his signature...

01:48:03.393 --> 01:48:04.477
using more than 100 pens.

01:48:04.644 --> 01:48:07.605
One of the coveted souvenirs
goes to the Nobel prize-winner...

01:48:07.772 --> 01:48:10.024
Martin Luther King,
a dedicated leader...

01:48:10.192 --> 01:48:12.026
Go on, say it, Clyde.

01:48:13.361 --> 01:48:17.865
Lt just seems so risky, Edgar,
over a couple negative articles.

01:48:18.533 --> 01:48:21.076
He's deliberately surrounded himself
with communists...

01:48:21.244 --> 01:48:25.039
and, with the power he's gathering,
he's now our greatest domestic threat.

01:48:25.207 --> 01:48:30.586
On behalf of the Nobel Committee...

01:48:30.754 --> 01:48:34.590
- ...we hand over to you the insignia...
- He's going to decline the award, Clyde.

01:48:34.758 --> 01:48:37.259
He knows what we have can ruin him.

01:48:37.427 --> 01:48:42.264
Of the Nobel Peace Prize,
the diploma and the gold medal.

01:48:47.312 --> 01:48:49.063
There's no question about it.

01:48:49.898 --> 01:48:51.273
He's done.

01:48:55.070 --> 01:48:58.781
L accept the Nobel Prize for Peace...

01:49:01.284 --> 01:49:06.622
at a moment when 22 million Negroes
of the United States...

01:49:08.625 --> 01:49:09.625
are enga...

01:49:27.978 --> 01:49:31.689
Sorry to interrupt, sir.
Your next appointment is here.

01:49:32.148 --> 01:49:34.483
The doctor first, Miss Gandy.

01:49:34.651 --> 01:49:36.110
Yes, of course.

01:49:38.321 --> 01:49:42.575
Send him in in a few minutes. Thank you.

01:51:41.945 --> 01:51:44.113
Stay strong, Edgar.

01:52:15.311 --> 01:52:17.646
You stay strong, Edgar.

01:52:18.606 --> 01:52:20.983
Stay strong. Unh!

01:52:45.425 --> 01:52:47.301
The parade as it makes its way...

01:52:47.469 --> 01:52:49.428
to the Capitol Building
for the inauguration.

01:52:52.515 --> 01:52:56.769
You can see the Roosevelt High
Marching Band leading the way.

01:52:59.272 --> 01:53:03.692
The motorcade is making progress
down Pennsylvania Avenue...

01:53:05.069 --> 01:53:08.030
carrying our 37th president.

01:53:14.204 --> 01:53:16.872
Richard Milhous Nixon
waves to the crowd.

01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:20.042
Yep, there's the president
and his wife Pat...

01:53:20.585 --> 01:53:22.211
happily waving.

01:53:58.081 --> 01:54:00.415
When morals decline...

01:54:01.209 --> 01:54:03.585
and good men do nothing...

01:54:04.546 --> 01:54:06.588
evil flourishes.

01:54:09.926 --> 01:54:14.596
Every citizen has a duty to learn of this
that threatens his home...

01:54:16.099 --> 01:54:17.266
his children.

01:54:21.604 --> 01:54:25.941
A society uninterested and unwilling
to learn from the past...

01:54:26.734 --> 01:54:27.860
is doomed.

01:54:31.990 --> 01:54:33.949
We must never forget our history.

01:54:39.747 --> 01:54:42.624
We must never lower our guard.

01:54:49.173 --> 01:54:55.262
Even today, there are organizations
that have America as their prime target.

01:54:55.430 --> 01:54:59.683
They would destroy the safety
and the happiness of every individual...

01:54:59.893 --> 01:55:03.312
and thrust us into
a condition of lawlessness...

01:55:03.479 --> 01:55:07.024
immorality that passes the imagination.

01:55:08.985 --> 01:55:11.653
The president will see you now,
Mr. Hoover.

01:55:11.988 --> 01:55:13.155
Alrighty.

01:55:24.626 --> 01:55:26.168
Edgar, come in.

01:55:37.472 --> 01:55:40.349
Oh, l am so sorry, Mr. Hoover.

01:55:40.516 --> 01:55:42.601
You weren't answering your telephone.

01:55:43.770 --> 01:55:46.438
You had a photo session
with a retiring agent.

01:55:46.606 --> 01:55:48.023
He's leaving now.

01:55:49.025 --> 01:55:50.359
Where's Clyde?

01:55:52.862 --> 01:55:56.031
Lt's a bad day for him, sir.

01:56:00.036 --> 01:56:03.872
Will you...? Will you schedule
a dinner for us, please...

01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:06.208
in our old corner booth?

01:56:07.377 --> 01:56:09.878
I'm afraid he's too tired today, sir.

01:56:10.046 --> 01:56:12.214
Perhaps you'd like to dine at his house?

01:56:12.382 --> 01:56:14.299
L think he'd like that.

01:56:16.135 --> 01:56:17.219
Yes.

01:56:18.221 --> 01:56:20.347
Yes, thank you, Miss Gandy.

01:56:26.771 --> 01:56:27.813
Helen?

01:56:32.068 --> 01:56:33.151
Yes?

01:56:36.072 --> 01:56:38.573
Do l kill everything that l love?

01:56:42.078 --> 01:56:44.579
He's not gone yet, Edgar.

01:56:48.584 --> 01:56:50.627
And everything that we've built?

01:56:51.587 --> 01:56:52.587
No.

01:56:53.172 --> 01:56:56.758
The Bureau is stronger
than just you and me now.

01:56:58.219 --> 01:57:01.263
Your child is sure
and keeps this country safe.

01:57:08.479 --> 01:57:09.938
Helen, if any...

01:57:10.356 --> 01:57:14.860
If anything ever happens to me, l need you
to do something for me, do you understand?

01:57:16.487 --> 01:57:17.821
Of course.

01:57:19.615 --> 01:57:22.200
Nixon, he's gonna come for it all.

01:57:24.203 --> 01:57:26.872
He'll crucify me and my Bureau.

01:57:28.499 --> 01:57:34.129
I'm afraid of what will happen
if I'm not here to protect it, Miss Gandy.

01:57:34.630 --> 01:57:36.631
Your private files, sir?

01:57:39.093 --> 01:57:42.137
Then no one will ever find them.

01:57:45.308 --> 01:57:46.641
Thank you, Helen.

01:57:57.653 --> 01:58:00.155
No matter what kind of pressure
they put on?

01:58:01.365 --> 01:58:03.200
No matter how much?

01:58:03.367 --> 01:58:04.993
Yes, Edgar.

01:58:05.995 --> 01:58:08.121
No matter how much pressure.

01:58:10.500 --> 01:58:12.000
L promise you.

01:58:14.170 --> 01:58:15.962
Thank you, Helen.

01:58:27.767 --> 01:58:31.103
Well, did Nixon ask for your resignation?

01:58:31.270 --> 01:58:35.899
No, he wanted to know
what we had in the files on him.

01:58:36.359 --> 01:58:37.984
What did you say?

01:58:38.528 --> 01:58:41.071
L said, "What files, sir?"

01:58:41.531 --> 01:58:43.156
But he knows.

01:58:43.866 --> 01:58:48.787
He wants us to expand our wiretaps
to include news reporters now, Clyde.

01:58:49.956 --> 01:58:53.291
We can't do that, especially not now.

01:58:53.459 --> 01:58:55.168
That's the problem, Clyde.

01:58:55.336 --> 01:59:00.215
If l don't agree to do his black bag jobs,
he'll create his own private force.

01:59:00.675 --> 01:59:03.135
Oh, that's illegal.

01:59:03.553 --> 01:59:09.224
Yes, well, he didn't say it outright,
but l saw it in his eyes.

01:59:09.392 --> 01:59:11.393
He won't be controlled, Clyde.

01:59:11.561 --> 01:59:15.480
He's a menace who'll do anything
to hold on to power.

01:59:16.732 --> 01:59:18.733
Right. l see.

01:59:19.569 --> 01:59:23.905
Yes. See, l never played his game,
that's the problem.

01:59:24.073 --> 01:59:26.533
And if to some what l did
seemed like rule-bending...

01:59:26.701 --> 01:59:30.120
then perhaps they need to figure out
what it is they did...

01:59:30.288 --> 01:59:33.748
that made them feel blackmailed
or intimidated.

01:59:34.250 --> 01:59:36.251
L wasn't thinking that.

01:59:37.503 --> 01:59:41.464
Then what? What were you thinking?

01:59:42.592 --> 01:59:46.386
L was thinking it might be time
for us to retire.

01:59:47.430 --> 01:59:48.889
Shut up, Clyde.

01:59:50.725 --> 01:59:53.602
You built a great thing, Edgar.

01:59:54.353 --> 01:59:57.647
And if you stop now,
you'll be celebrated.

01:59:58.524 --> 02:00:00.609
That's what you've
always wanted, isn't it?

02:00:00.776 --> 02:00:03.445
Our country's lasting adoration?

02:00:03.613 --> 02:00:06.114
Well, there's a chance you could have it.

02:00:06.949 --> 02:00:10.368
Yes. Yes, and why wouldn't l? Hmm?

02:00:10.536 --> 02:00:12.162
Why wouldn't l, Clyde?

02:00:12.330 --> 02:00:15.874
L saved this country
from a Bolshevik invasion...

02:00:16.042 --> 02:00:19.961
rid this country of radicals,
captured Machine Gun Kelly...

02:00:20.129 --> 02:00:23.548
killed Dillinger, captured Karpis,
convicted Bruno Hauptmann.

02:00:23.758 --> 02:00:27.344
And now, with my last breath when l try
to help save this country again...

02:00:27.511 --> 02:00:30.013
I'm rewarded with a forced retirement?

02:00:30.181 --> 02:00:32.974
L will not go down,
and the fact that you suggest that...

02:00:33.142 --> 02:00:35.518
makes me question your very loyalty.

02:00:36.562 --> 02:00:38.563
My loyalty, Edgar?

02:00:38.773 --> 02:00:41.191
Yes, your loyalty, Clyde.

02:00:42.276 --> 02:00:45.070
L read your manuscript, Edgar.

02:00:46.155 --> 02:00:48.490
You didn't arrest Karpis.

02:00:48.658 --> 02:00:52.827
And you know as well as l do
there was no white horse in the street...

02:00:53.829 --> 02:00:56.039
no gun in the back seat.

02:00:56.999 --> 02:01:01.503
And you didn't kill Dillinger.
Agent Purvis did.

02:01:02.004 --> 02:01:05.882
But you kept all the glory for yourself.

02:01:06.217 --> 02:01:10.845
And Machine Gun Kelly never said,
"Don't shoot, G-Men."

02:01:11.514 --> 02:01:16.977
You made that up
to sell comic books, Edgar.

02:01:17.520 --> 02:01:22.315
And when we went to the scene
of the greatest crime of the century...

02:01:22.900 --> 02:01:26.945
Mr. Lindbergh didn't come out
and shake your hand...

02:01:27.113 --> 02:01:31.574
and express his faith in the FBI.

02:01:31.742 --> 02:01:38.039
He called you a fussy little man,
and he refused to even meet you.

02:01:40.376 --> 02:01:43.003
And you didn't arrest Hauptmann.

02:01:44.171 --> 02:01:46.464
Agent Sisk did.

02:01:46.632 --> 02:01:51.136
You weren't even at the scene, Edgar.
Only the photo op.

02:01:51.304 --> 02:01:55.348
Edgar, most of what you wrote
is exaggeration...

02:01:55.516 --> 02:02:00.895
some of it blatant lies, and l don't
even know if you realize it anymore.

02:02:02.773 --> 02:02:04.899
Edgar...

02:02:05.067 --> 02:02:09.070
you can lie to everyone else,
the whole world...

02:02:09.238 --> 02:02:12.907
for your own sake,
for the sake of the Bureau...

02:02:13.617 --> 02:02:15.744
but you cannot lie to me.

02:02:19.248 --> 02:02:22.667
L should've never given you
your job, Clyde.

02:02:24.420 --> 02:02:25.754
You know that?

02:02:27.923 --> 02:02:30.216
You weren't even qualified.

02:02:33.304 --> 02:02:36.264
You remember the day
you came in for your interview?

02:02:37.475 --> 02:02:39.184
L do.

02:02:41.270 --> 02:02:45.648
You walked into my office
and you fixed my window...

02:02:45.816 --> 02:02:48.526
you picked up my handkerchief.

02:02:48.944 --> 02:02:50.612
You handed it to me.

02:02:52.990 --> 02:02:55.658
You remember why l was sweating,
Clyde?

02:02:57.203 --> 02:02:59.788
Lt's because you were exercising.

02:03:01.957 --> 02:03:03.291
No, l was...

02:03:04.502 --> 02:03:06.461
l was sweating because l...

02:03:07.296 --> 02:03:09.464
l knew at that very moment...

02:03:11.300 --> 02:03:13.635
l knew at that very moment that l...

02:03:15.137 --> 02:03:16.638
l needed you.

02:03:18.307 --> 02:03:21.976
And I've never needed anyone else
in my entire life.

02:03:24.063 --> 02:03:25.647
Not like that.

02:03:27.525 --> 02:03:29.943
So l began to perspire.

02:03:30.861 --> 02:03:32.070
L know.

02:03:34.990 --> 02:03:37.492
Edgar, are you all right?

02:03:38.494 --> 02:03:39.828
Yes, yes, it's...

02:03:40.955 --> 02:03:45.166
lt's just indigestion, Clyde.

02:03:48.754 --> 02:03:52.924
Let's go to dinner tomorrow night,
shall we? Our old corner booth.

02:03:54.593 --> 02:03:56.177
Perhaps if l feel better.

02:03:56.345 --> 02:03:58.096
Yes.

02:03:58.264 --> 02:03:59.514
And you must...

02:03:59.682 --> 02:04:04.477
You must...
We have a great many things to discuss.

02:04:04.645 --> 02:04:08.523
And now l can't trust anyone else
at the Bureau right now.

02:04:10.025 --> 02:04:11.985
Can only depend on you.

02:04:31.505 --> 02:04:33.506
Thank you, Edgar.

02:04:48.439 --> 02:04:49.898
Good night, Clyde.

02:04:51.525 --> 02:04:53.276
Good night, Edgar.

02:05:19.053 --> 02:05:20.595
Welcome home, Mr. Hoover.

02:05:20.763 --> 02:05:21.804
Oh, thank you, Annie.

02:05:21.972 --> 02:05:24.641
Bozo, Bozo, G-Boy, come here.

02:05:24.808 --> 02:05:27.852
The very essence of our democracy...

02:05:28.187 --> 02:05:32.607
is rooted in a belief
in the worth of the individual.

02:05:33.275 --> 02:05:38.154
That life has meaning that transcends
any man-made system...

02:05:38.781 --> 02:05:42.450
that love is the greatest force
on earth...

02:05:44.119 --> 02:05:46.788
far more enduring than hatred...

02:05:47.831 --> 02:05:51.793
or the unnatural divisions of mankind.

02:06:02.471 --> 02:06:03.638
Yes?

02:06:04.348 --> 02:06:07.809
This is Annie from Mr. Hoover's residence.

02:06:07.977 --> 02:06:10.395
Mr. Hoover has passed.

02:06:39.341 --> 02:06:40.550
- Yeah?
- Sir.

02:06:44.179 --> 02:06:46.514
Jesus Christ.

02:06:47.182 --> 02:06:49.434
That old cocksucker.

02:06:49.602 --> 02:06:52.270
I'll get a speech prepared.
We should go on television.

02:06:52.438 --> 02:06:53.938
Not yet.

02:06:54.106 --> 02:06:58.401
First seal off his office, change his
locks, do whatever you have to do.

02:06:58.569 --> 02:07:01.195
L want those fucking files.

02:07:02.031 --> 02:07:03.197
Yes, sir.

02:07:12.041 --> 02:07:13.708
Oh, good.

02:07:14.543 --> 02:07:16.377
Come in.

02:07:21.925 --> 02:07:24.218
He's upstairs.

02:09:28.510 --> 02:09:32.847
Ladies and gentlemen, it is with
a profound sense of personal loss...

02:09:33.015 --> 02:09:36.017
that l learned of the death
of J. Edgar Hoover.

02:09:36.685 --> 02:09:40.855
This truly remarkable man
has served his country for 48 years...

02:09:41.023 --> 02:09:43.691
under eight presidents,
as director of the FBI...

02:09:43.859 --> 02:09:49.697
with unparalleled devotion
and ability and dedication.

02:09:49.865 --> 02:09:54.535
For 25 years, from the time l came to
Washington as a freshman congressman...

02:09:55.078 --> 02:09:59.373
he has been one of my closest
personal friends and advisors.

02:09:59.541 --> 02:10:03.461
And every American, in my opinion,
owes J. Edgar Hoover a great debt...

02:10:03.629 --> 02:10:08.049
for building the FBI into the finest
law enforcement organization...

02:10:08.217 --> 02:10:10.134
in the entire world.

02:10:11.970 --> 02:10:16.891
I've ordered that all the flags of the
government buildings be flown at half mast...

02:10:17.059 --> 02:10:19.727
but l will say that, in doing so,
that Edgar Hoover...

02:10:19.895 --> 02:10:24.607
because of his indomitable courage
against sometimes very vicious attack...

02:10:24.775 --> 02:10:31.072
has made certain that the flag
of the FBI will always fly high.

02:10:31.240 --> 02:10:38.246
The FBI is the eternal monument
honoring this great American.

02:10:40.249 --> 02:10:42.083
Funny how even the dearest face...

02:10:42.251 --> 02:10:44.752
will fade away in time...

02:10:45.295 --> 02:10:50.258
but most clearly l remember your eyes
with a sort of teasing smile in them...

02:10:50.676 --> 02:10:53.427
and the feeling of that soft spot...

02:10:53.595 --> 02:10:56.764
just northeast
of the corner of your mouth.
