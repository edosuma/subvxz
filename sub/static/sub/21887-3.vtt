14:44.723 --> 14:46.923
What do you think?

14:46.958 --> 14:47.957
NYGMA: What?

14:50.306 --> 14:51.970
I'm sorry.

14:52.130 --> 14:54.264
Who... who are you?

14:54.299 --> 14:55.665
You don't remember?

14:55.700 --> 14:56.966
Hilltop Elementary?

14:57.002 --> 14:58.701
Mrs. Macher's class?

14:58.737 --> 15:02.138
I was third row closest to the window.

15:02.173 --> 15:04.674
Eddie, it's me, Myrtle Jenkins.

15:04.709 --> 15:06.376
(Myrtle chuckles)

15:06.411 --> 15:08.945
Um, I followed your rise
to becoming the Riddler.

15:08.980 --> 15:12.716
I've read every article,
all the police reports.

15:12.984 --> 15:15.485
I guess you could say
I'm your number one fan.

15:15.723 --> 15:17.413
Okay.

15:17.722 --> 15:21.190
Um, I'm... I should get going.

15:21.226 --> 15:22.725
Whoop, that's gonna be tough.

15:22.761 --> 15:25.295
(grunts)

15:25.330 --> 15:28.957
(panting)

15:28.982 --> 15:30.967
Why am I tied up?

15:31.002 --> 15:32.535
You're not.

15:32.570 --> 15:35.004
Your muscles have atrophied
from being on ice.

15:35.040 --> 15:36.539
Okay? But don't worry.

15:36.574 --> 15:39.115
These warming lamps
should help thaw you out.

15:39.344 --> 15:40.543
Ice?

15:40.578 --> 15:41.911
Yeah.

15:41.947 --> 15:43.951
- The last thing I remember...
- Yeah.

15:43.997 --> 15:47.349
...was being frozen by the river.

15:47.519 --> 15:49.719
How long was I on ice?

15:51.756 --> 15:52.855
Five months.

15:52.891 --> 15:54.424
(gasps)

15:54.459 --> 15:55.770
I know.

15:55.871 --> 16:00.897
Since then, Penguin opened a
club called the Iceberg Lounge.

16:01.399 --> 16:03.366
You were its centerpiece.

16:03.835 --> 16:05.460
NYGMA: That little freak.

16:05.704 --> 16:09.205
He put me on display
like some caged animal.

16:09.240 --> 16:10.273
Yes.

16:10.308 --> 16:12.442
And I will nurse you back to health

16:12.477 --> 16:13.843
so you can reclaim your throne

16:13.878 --> 16:16.869
as Gotham's greatest villain!

16:16.894 --> 16:18.581
(laughs)

16:18.616 --> 16:20.016
Oop, ah, caveat.

16:20.051 --> 16:21.451
With me as your sidekick, of course.

16:21.502 --> 16:22.721
(Myrtle laughs)

16:22.837 --> 16:25.370
Doesn't that sound wonderful, my love?

16:27.558 --> 16:28.824
(scoffs)

16:37.602 --> 16:39.068
You lost, kid?

16:39.485 --> 16:41.961
My Uncle Al works on your ship.

16:42.106 --> 16:45.041
My aunt hasn't heard from him
in a few days and she's worried.

16:45.328 --> 16:46.809
There are a few men below deck.

16:47.266 --> 16:48.884
I'm pretty damn sure
none of their old ladies

16:48.909 --> 16:50.406
are looking for them.

16:50.570 --> 16:53.316
Listen, I told my aunt I'd find him.

16:53.351 --> 16:54.917
Can I just take a quick look?

16:54.953 --> 16:57.053
I'll be in and out
in a few minutes, I promise.

16:58.701 --> 17:01.186
Sure. Go ahead.

17:02.026 --> 17:03.426
Thank you.

17:18.643 --> 17:21.210
(door creaks, closes)

17:51.109 --> 17:53.652
You think you're real smart
giving us the slip.

17:55.304 --> 17:57.246
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Ah, save it.

17:57.281 --> 17:59.573
Somebody tried to steal
from this ship last night.

17:59.784 --> 18:01.753
Did this to my face.

18:01.919 --> 18:03.761
Tell me who you are working for.

18:03.824 --> 18:05.256
I assure you,

18:05.300 --> 18:06.789
I'm just here looking for my uncle.

18:06.824 --> 18:08.557
I took a wrong turn.

18:08.593 --> 18:11.093
Sure. Here's a little advice.

18:11.347 --> 18:13.396
If you're gonna play the part
of a street kid,

18:13.431 --> 18:15.064
learn how to talk like one.

18:15.099 --> 18:16.899
(American accent): Hey, Andy!

18:16.934 --> 18:18.634
Get over here.

18:18.996 --> 18:21.564
What did I tell you about
bothering me at work?

18:21.816 --> 18:23.949
Sorry, fellas.

18:28.153 --> 18:29.685
(normal voice): You're right, though.

18:29.714 --> 18:32.415
The boy's acting does need
some work, doesn't it?

18:32.450 --> 18:34.216
(men grunting)

18:37.108 --> 18:38.821
You see, improvisation,

18:38.856 --> 18:40.839
Master Bruce, is a very important weapon

18:40.956 --> 18:43.112
in any actor's tool kit.

18:43.528 --> 18:44.860
Should we go?

18:49.901 --> 18:51.267
BARBARA: There's a knife

18:51.302 --> 18:53.472
being sold at your auction tonight.

18:53.594 --> 18:55.181
I was thinking you might be kind enough

18:55.206 --> 18:57.417
to sell it to me ahead of time.

18:57.656 --> 18:59.221
Hmm.

19:00.845 --> 19:03.012
And why is this knife
so important to you?

19:03.047 --> 19:05.047
It's not.

19:05.083 --> 19:06.649
I have a client who's interested.

19:06.860 --> 19:09.218
Gave me a ton of cash,
so I was hoping to get it

19:09.253 --> 19:11.375
for a lower price and make a profit.

19:11.589 --> 19:15.524
That start with the attempted
five-finger discount last night?

19:16.140 --> 19:18.027
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

19:18.062 --> 19:19.895
Of course you don't.

19:20.351 --> 19:22.465
I'll triple the opening price.

19:22.500 --> 19:24.300
It'll probably go for less at auction.

19:24.335 --> 19:26.440
(giggles) My dear,

19:26.754 --> 19:29.255
wherever you disappeared
to these last few months

19:29.440 --> 19:31.740
has not made you a better liar.

19:32.507 --> 19:34.991
(chuckles) It's clear that this

19:35.101 --> 19:39.202
isn't about profit, but about
your mysterious benefactor.

19:39.383 --> 19:42.442
He is your client, is-is he not?

19:43.287 --> 19:45.721
(chuckles)

19:48.526 --> 19:49.825
Reveal his identity to me

19:49.861 --> 19:51.193
and you have a deal.

19:55.598 --> 19:57.739
(laughs) Wow.

19:57.791 --> 19:59.758
He's really got his hooks into you.

19:59.904 --> 20:01.370
(laughs)

20:01.490 --> 20:03.497
See you tonight, I guess.

20:03.641 --> 20:05.741
Don't forget to bring your checkbook.

20:13.584 --> 20:16.118
Always a pleasure, Oswald.

20:41.937 --> 20:44.037
BRUCE: The knife was used
to embalm King Balahsi.

20:44.315 --> 20:45.881
According to this, he ruled
ancient Mesopotamia

20:45.917 --> 20:47.355
for the first century.

20:47.652 --> 20:50.886
And what thief in Gotham
would want a knife like that?

20:50.922 --> 20:52.922
That's a good question.

20:52.957 --> 20:55.391
According to the manifest,
the shipment was full of jewels

20:55.426 --> 20:57.092
and expensive art, yet our thief

20:57.128 --> 20:59.161
went for the item with
the least intrinsic value.

20:59.197 --> 21:00.996
Well, that tells me
she was a gun for hire.

21:02.172 --> 21:04.300
But who hired her?

21:10.374 --> 21:12.100
I think I just found the answer.

21:12.276 --> 21:14.810
Alfred, look. This drawing

21:14.845 --> 21:18.147
depicts a man being healed by water.

21:18.182 --> 21:19.615
Look at his eyes.

21:21.619 --> 21:23.405
His face.

21:25.467 --> 21:27.690
Who does that remind you of?

21:30.061 --> 21:31.760
That's impossible.

21:31.796 --> 21:34.530
I mean, this-this drawing
is 2,000 years old, Master...

21:34.565 --> 21:35.998
I know.

21:42.073 --> 21:43.472
That's him.

21:44.104 --> 21:46.713
That's Ra's al Ghul.

21:50.047 --> 21:52.047
He wants the knife.

22:00.466 --> 22:02.426
I struck out with Falcone.

22:02.566 --> 22:04.301
BULLOCK (on phone): <i>That right?</i>

22:05.816 --> 22:07.549
Try not to sound too happy about it.

22:07.613 --> 22:09.513
<i>Look, if you brought back Falcone,</i>

22:09.548 --> 22:11.815
<i>that would mean gang wars
and blood in the streets.</i>

22:11.850 --> 22:13.996
<i>And I don't like it when
the streets are bloody, Jim.</i>

22:14.021 --> 22:17.021
Yeah. Well, see how
you like it with Penguin.

22:17.280 --> 22:18.679
See you tomorrow, Harvey.

22:18.715 --> 22:20.715
(phone beeps off)

22:21.784 --> 22:23.951
SOFIA: Mind if I join you?

22:29.854 --> 22:31.510
What are you doing here?

22:31.807 --> 22:33.526
I figured you didn't
know anyone in town.

22:33.612 --> 22:35.096
I thought I'd keep you company.

22:35.565 --> 22:38.466
Or maybe I just didn't
want to drink alone.

22:42.739 --> 22:44.672
To my dad.

22:51.981 --> 22:54.656
I am sorry about your father.

22:55.461 --> 22:57.184
We may have had our
differences over the years,

22:57.220 --> 22:59.187
but I always respected him.

22:59.956 --> 23:01.554
Hmm.

23:02.258 --> 23:04.117
When I was a little girl,

23:04.283 --> 23:06.060
if I wanted to spend
time with my father,

23:06.095 --> 23:07.962
he'd have me schedule an appointment.

23:08.230 --> 23:11.050
Save the respect, I know
who my father is.

23:11.784 --> 23:13.134
Took him getting sick for us

23:13.169 --> 23:15.105
to finally have a real relationship.

23:22.111 --> 23:23.970
How long have you lived down here?

23:24.680 --> 23:26.501
Since I was 13.

23:26.916 --> 23:28.582
My father thought sending
me away from Gotham

23:28.630 --> 23:30.427
would keep me safe.

23:30.762 --> 23:33.598
I mean, there are worse
places to grow up.

23:33.856 --> 23:35.322
People are happy here,

23:35.358 --> 23:36.884
you see the sun every day.

23:36.959 --> 23:39.915
But I wasn't alone. I had Mario.

23:40.626 --> 23:42.496
We took care of each other.

23:48.104 --> 23:50.171
I know there's nothing I can say.

23:52.041 --> 23:54.508
I am sorry for what happened to him.

23:59.315 --> 24:01.982
You're right,
there's nothing you can say.

24:04.287 --> 24:06.178
He was infected with the virus.

24:06.289 --> 24:08.535
You did what you had to do.

24:17.166 --> 24:18.933
(dance music playing)

24:18.968 --> 24:22.003
There's no sign of Nygma
anywhere in Gotham.

24:22.338 --> 24:26.652
Word on the street is,
it was an inside job.

24:26.976 --> 24:29.176
Find whoever is in charge of hiring.

24:29.212 --> 24:30.478
Kill them.

24:30.513 --> 24:32.780
I want everyone here interrogated.

24:32.815 --> 24:35.146
There's a traitor amongst us.

24:40.590 --> 24:42.590
(gasping)

24:44.994 --> 24:47.895
MYRTLE: Those needles should
help stimulate your muscles.

24:47.930 --> 24:50.030
You'll have feeling back in no time.

24:50.066 --> 24:51.832
(laughing)

24:51.868 --> 24:53.667
Just call me the Riddlette.

24:53.703 --> 24:55.703
(laughs): I know.

24:55.738 --> 24:56.704
What do you think?

24:56.739 --> 24:58.316
I think that rehashing

24:58.341 --> 25:00.541
someone else's idea isn't very original.

25:02.162 --> 25:04.326
Well, it's an homage,

25:04.428 --> 25:05.913
and I thought you'd like it.

25:10.887 --> 25:12.624
It's very nice.

25:13.189 --> 25:15.589
(giggles)

25:15.625 --> 25:19.159
Ah... this is so much fun.

25:19.374 --> 25:21.562
If only I were the criminal
mastermind you are,

25:21.597 --> 25:23.264
we would have been together sooner.

25:23.833 --> 25:26.233
I'm sorry, I don't really follow that.

25:26.356 --> 25:28.435
Well, it took me months
to plan your escape.

25:28.471 --> 25:30.204
I had to learn Penguin's schedule,

25:30.239 --> 25:31.739
when he came and went,

25:31.774 --> 25:33.969
devise an exit strategy.

25:34.076 --> 25:35.576
I'm sure it would have
taken you two seconds

25:35.611 --> 25:37.781
to think something up.

25:38.414 --> 25:40.047
It is slightly impressive

25:40.082 --> 25:42.078
you were able to outwit Oswald.

25:42.718 --> 25:44.018
Though, as you said, my plan would have

25:44.053 --> 25:45.418
taken much less time.

25:45.463 --> 25:46.962
Oh, wait, that is a great idea.

25:47.123 --> 25:49.023
You should tell me what
your plan would have been,

25:49.058 --> 25:51.225
because a window
into your master villainy

25:51.260 --> 25:53.160
would mean so much to me.

26:05.474 --> 26:07.362
I...

26:08.933 --> 26:10.933
Um... (breathing unsteadily)

26:15.017 --> 26:17.785
Oh, here I am bombarding you
with silly questions.

26:17.820 --> 26:19.286
After everything you've been through,

26:19.322 --> 26:20.721
you must be exhausted.

26:20.756 --> 26:22.353
Yes.

26:22.884 --> 26:25.551
- Yes, I must be exhausted.
- (timer bell chimes)

26:25.595 --> 26:27.595
Ooh, soup's ready. Do you like tomato?

26:27.630 --> 26:30.097
I put little question marks in it, too.

26:52.119 --> 26:54.186
Last one.

26:54.221 --> 26:56.188
One, two, three.

26:57.458 --> 26:59.224
(both sigh)

27:01.128 --> 27:03.629
Anything, my love?

27:07.962 --> 27:09.835
No!

27:09.870 --> 27:13.672
Acupuncture... is therapeutic snake oil.

27:13.707 --> 27:15.240
(gasps)

27:15.276 --> 27:17.342
I've been focused on
repairing the wrong muscle.

27:17.378 --> 27:18.610
What?

27:18.646 --> 27:20.445
Your brain.

27:20.481 --> 27:22.281
It fires synapses that carry neurons

27:22.316 --> 27:23.582
to the rest of your body.

27:23.617 --> 27:25.275
And if we can stimulate it,

27:25.386 --> 27:27.126
perhaps your other muscles will follow.

27:27.278 --> 27:29.330
- Logical.
- Yeah.

27:29.447 --> 27:30.646
- What do you suggest?
- Well...

27:30.682 --> 27:32.882
in anticipation of our partnership,

27:32.917 --> 27:35.952
I have been working on a few riddles.

27:35.987 --> 27:36.953
(gasps)

27:37.001 --> 27:38.906
Yes. Riddles.

27:38.931 --> 27:40.089
Yeah. (giggles)

27:40.124 --> 27:42.197
That's exactly what I need.

27:42.603 --> 27:44.892
It's gonna make me feel
like myself again.

27:45.363 --> 27:47.930
- Fire away.
- Okay, here goes.

27:48.435 --> 27:50.701
What's black and white and red all over?

27:50.853 --> 27:53.469
Easy. Zebra, with a gaping hole.

27:53.504 --> 27:55.137
- Next.
- Um,

27:55.173 --> 27:56.672
no, it's actually a newspaper.

27:56.708 --> 27:58.307
That's ridiculous.

27:58.343 --> 28:00.476
There's nothing red
on a newspaper. Next.

28:00.511 --> 28:02.244
- Well, it makes sense if you know...
- Next!

28:02.280 --> 28:03.950
Oh, um...

28:04.148 --> 28:05.948
I have a face and two hands,

28:05.984 --> 28:07.350
but no arms or legs.

28:07.493 --> 28:09.685
- What am I?
- Deformed baby.

28:09.766 --> 28:12.321
Come on. Surely you can
do better than this.

28:12.357 --> 28:15.204
Uh, the answer is a clock. Hands...

28:15.293 --> 28:17.735
Oh, my.

28:18.308 --> 28:21.032
I think something is wrong
with your brain, Ed.

28:21.866 --> 28:25.446
There... is... nothing...

28:25.837 --> 28:26.836
wrong with my brain.

28:26.871 --> 28:29.567
The problem is your riddles.

28:29.615 --> 28:32.549
Bring me a riddle

28:32.584 --> 28:34.151
that is worthy of my name!

28:34.186 --> 28:36.520
(sighs curtly)

28:41.427 --> 28:43.226
(seagulls squawking)

28:43.262 --> 28:45.611
GORDON: Next time I'll know
to pack a swimsuit.

28:45.798 --> 28:47.721
SOFIA: You actually own one?

28:48.048 --> 28:50.052
Yeah, I got a nice two-piece.

28:51.337 --> 28:53.537
He comes with a sense of humor.

28:58.010 --> 29:00.310
Do you ever think about
walking away from it all?

29:01.204 --> 29:02.636
Gotham?

29:04.183 --> 29:05.975
Sometimes.

29:06.719 --> 29:08.389
But I can't.

29:08.654 --> 29:10.194
Why not?

29:10.456 --> 29:12.816
It's in my blood.

29:13.058 --> 29:14.958
My father spent his entire life

29:14.994 --> 29:16.259
fighting for the city.

29:16.295 --> 29:18.363
Never took the easy way out.

29:18.488 --> 29:20.063
Neither can I.

29:25.204 --> 29:27.128
What?

29:28.198 --> 29:30.073
Give 'em to me.

29:32.745 --> 29:35.126
I don't really think they're your size.

29:35.308 --> 29:36.767
Come on.

29:37.716 --> 29:39.595
- That, too?
- Mm-hmm.

29:39.752 --> 29:42.486
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

29:44.314 --> 29:46.189
You can't be serious.

29:47.493 --> 29:49.806
Just a little water, Jim.

30:11.250 --> 30:14.651
I can't remember the last time
I just stood still.

30:48.174 --> 30:50.026
All right, Master Bruce,

30:50.543 --> 30:52.643
let's go over the plan again.

30:52.893 --> 30:54.460
It's simple.

30:54.582 --> 30:56.830
I show up at the auction
and buy the knife.

30:57.018 --> 30:58.951
Should be easy enough;
I am a billionaire.

30:58.986 --> 31:00.975
And a very public one at that.

31:01.155 --> 31:03.722
Turning up at the Penguin's
black market auction's

31:03.758 --> 31:06.561
certainly going to raise
a few eyebrows, isn't it?

31:07.762 --> 31:09.395
You're the one that said
that bidding on it

31:09.430 --> 31:10.800
was the smarter play.

31:10.965 --> 31:14.159
That I did, but I didn't mean
as going as yourself, did I?

31:14.368 --> 31:15.734
What do think the idea was

31:15.770 --> 31:16.836
of going down to the docks,

31:16.871 --> 31:18.003
pretending to be someone else?

31:18.039 --> 31:21.574
I was trying to teach you a lesson.

31:21.609 --> 31:24.610
Now, if you're going to continue
down this vigilante path,

31:24.645 --> 31:25.811
Master Bruce,

31:26.721 --> 31:29.248
you've got to learn how to assume...

31:29.549 --> 31:31.627
other roles.

31:40.114 --> 31:42.417
Play the role

31:42.726 --> 31:44.626
that you were born to play.

31:48.787 --> 31:50.732
That of a privileged, somewhat...

31:51.539 --> 31:53.772
pedantic teenager with deeper pockets

31:53.808 --> 31:56.138
than anybody else in this city.

31:57.211 --> 31:59.111
You mean behave like a spoiled brat.

31:59.146 --> 32:01.780
It goes against everything
that your beautiful parents

32:01.816 --> 32:03.851
tried to ingrain in you.

32:04.685 --> 32:05.885
But yes...

32:06.038 --> 32:07.476
sir.

32:11.773 --> 32:13.570
Bruce Wayne...

32:15.997 --> 32:18.515
...billionaire brat.

32:18.666 --> 32:20.374
$250,000!

32:20.501 --> 32:23.100
AUCTIONEER: $250,000 going once,

32:23.204 --> 32:25.037
twice... sold

32:25.100 --> 32:26.372
to Mr. Bruce Wayne.

32:26.407 --> 32:28.374
Ha-ha! That's what I'm talkin' about.

32:28.409 --> 32:30.085
I love art.

32:30.323 --> 32:32.156
I love it, yeah!

32:32.246 --> 32:34.866
I'm gonna put it in my,
uh, in my bathroom.

32:34.949 --> 32:36.348
(crowd murmuring)

32:36.384 --> 32:37.750
ALFRED: Steady on, Master Bruce.

32:37.785 --> 32:39.518
Let's not overplay our hand, shall we?

32:39.553 --> 32:40.853
I must admit, this is fun.

32:40.888 --> 32:44.090
And try to exercise a modicum
of financial restraint.

32:44.152 --> 32:45.157
Technically, you are the richest man

32:45.202 --> 32:46.669
in the room, but let's not try and buy

32:46.694 --> 32:48.560
absolutely everything, shall we?

32:48.596 --> 32:50.029
True, but if I only bid on the knife

32:50.064 --> 32:51.163
everyone's been trying
to steal from Penguin,

32:51.198 --> 32:53.165
it might draw his suspicion.

32:53.401 --> 32:54.733
If I go on a spending spree,

32:54.769 --> 32:56.101
recklessly throwing my money around,

32:56.137 --> 32:57.503
he won't think twice.

32:57.538 --> 33:00.172
Nice. When'd you think of that?

33:00.207 --> 33:02.007
Improvisation, Alfred.

33:02.043 --> 33:04.109
It's a weapon in any actor's tool kit.

33:04.145 --> 33:05.511
Oh, heads up.

33:05.546 --> 33:07.233
Here we go.

33:09.583 --> 33:12.418
Oswald, my friend!

33:12.575 --> 33:15.054
Bruce Wayne, what a lovely surprise.

33:15.089 --> 33:16.622
You certainly are getting out

33:16.657 --> 33:18.590
quite a lot these days, aren't you?

33:18.626 --> 33:21.037
The way I see it, everyone else
in this town is having fun.

33:21.130 --> 33:23.228
- Why shouldn't I?
- I agree!

33:23.497 --> 33:25.800
You and your insanely large bank account

33:25.825 --> 33:27.042
are more than welcome here.

33:27.067 --> 33:28.901
(both laugh)

33:28.936 --> 33:31.248
Barbara Kean.

33:31.639 --> 33:33.576
I thought she died.

33:34.141 --> 33:36.725
Unfortunately, nobody
stays dead in this town.

33:37.311 --> 33:38.510
Excuse me.

33:39.847 --> 33:41.647
You do realize, don't you, Master Bruce,

33:41.682 --> 33:43.426
that if you actually win,

33:43.651 --> 33:46.085
Ra's al Ghul will come after the knife.

33:48.122 --> 33:49.622
Let him.

33:49.757 --> 33:51.991
AUCTIONEER: The next item up for auction

33:52.026 --> 33:53.770
is an embalming knife

33:54.052 --> 33:57.794
from the tomb of King
Balahsi of Sumeria.

33:58.032 --> 34:00.762
Opening bid will begin at $50,000.

34:01.106 --> 34:02.568
BARBARA: A hundred...

34:02.664 --> 34:04.431
thousand dollars.

34:04.505 --> 34:06.005
What does she want with it?

34:06.040 --> 34:07.406
I have no idea.

34:07.441 --> 34:08.607
Stay focused.

34:08.641 --> 34:10.850
$100,000 to Ms. Kean.

34:10.978 --> 34:13.178
- Do I hear one...
- One hundred thousand

34:13.214 --> 34:14.980
- and one dollar.
- (laughter)

34:15.016 --> 34:17.815
Actually, Mr. Wayne, the bidding
amounts are in $50,000...

34:17.851 --> 34:19.451
- $200,000.
- Fine.

34:19.487 --> 34:20.853
We have $200,000.

34:20.888 --> 34:22.420
Two hundred thousand

34:22.456 --> 34:24.123
and one dollar.

34:24.158 --> 34:25.623
(laughter)

34:27.862 --> 34:29.495
BARBARA: Mr. Wayne.

34:30.327 --> 34:32.623
How about you let someone
else have some fun?

34:32.733 --> 34:34.867
Oh! Sure.

34:34.922 --> 34:37.297
No problem. I'm sorry about that.

34:41.422 --> 34:44.543
- $300,000.
- Very well. Three hundred...

34:44.578 --> 34:48.949
$300,000 and one cent.

34:48.974 --> 34:50.282
(laughter)

34:50.732 --> 34:52.935
$500,000.

34:53.833 --> 34:55.899
Now back off, you little brat.

34:55.989 --> 34:57.322
Wow, Ms. Kean.

34:57.476 --> 34:59.324
That's a lot of money.

34:59.484 --> 35:01.060
For someone like you.

35:01.085 --> 35:04.187
- $2 million!
- (attendees gasping)

35:04.298 --> 35:05.364
BARBARA: Two...

35:05.399 --> 35:08.244
Sold to Mr. Bruce Wayne.

35:08.269 --> 35:10.702
- (laughs)
- (applause)

35:10.738 --> 35:12.738
(laughs)

35:17.445 --> 35:19.850
Congratulations, Bruce.

35:20.114 --> 35:22.006
Thank you.

35:23.751 --> 35:26.985
(laughing): I do love
seeing that woman lose.

35:27.021 --> 35:28.900
But a little piece of friendly advice.

35:28.925 --> 35:30.856
Barbara Kean does not give up easily.

35:30.891 --> 35:32.758
She'll be coming for that knife.

35:32.793 --> 35:36.361
I would just, uh, keep a
close eye on it if I were you.

35:40.590 --> 35:43.340
Well, there's a new wrinkle, isn't it?

35:47.208 --> 35:49.508
What's green and red
and goes round and round?

35:49.543 --> 35:52.644
(both chuckle)

35:53.715 --> 35:56.997
Someone's obsessed
with the color red. (laughs)

35:57.357 --> 36:00.341
The answer, obviously,
isn't "newspaper."

36:00.488 --> 36:01.553
You're stalling.

36:01.589 --> 36:04.158
(laughs) No.

36:04.817 --> 36:07.459
- You don't know the answer.
- Of course I do.

36:07.495 --> 36:09.661
No, you don't, Ed.

36:11.899 --> 36:13.121
(gasps)

36:13.207 --> 36:15.612
- Mm-hmm.
- Your brilliant mind is as damaged

36:15.637 --> 36:17.102
as the rest of your body.

36:18.772 --> 36:20.372
Actually,

36:20.745 --> 36:22.407
my body is feeling fine.

36:25.446 --> 36:27.246
Frog in a blender.

36:43.163 --> 36:45.163
BRUCE: Selina?

36:47.534 --> 36:51.538
Why are you sitting
in the dark by yourself?

36:51.563 --> 36:53.327
I was expecting someone else.

36:53.585 --> 36:55.718
- Like who?
- Doesn't matter.

36:55.746 --> 36:57.713
What are you doing here?

36:58.069 --> 37:01.099
Heard about Penguin's auction.

37:01.552 --> 37:03.521
So Barbara sent you for the knife.

37:03.721 --> 37:06.555
Figured, what, because we're
friends, I'd just hand it over?

37:06.833 --> 37:08.557
Something like that.

37:08.805 --> 37:11.627
- Why is it so important to her?
- How should I know?

37:11.662 --> 37:13.985
She was supposed to get it
for some client.

37:14.027 --> 37:15.994
Said he was a pretty dangerous guy.

37:16.449 --> 37:19.621
And that if you were smart,

37:19.683 --> 37:21.699
you'd hand it over
and save yourself the trouble.

37:22.603 --> 37:25.377
So you're here to protect me,
is that it?

37:25.463 --> 37:27.505
The knife can't possibly mean
that much to you, Bruce.

37:27.540 --> 37:28.673
I don't know.

37:28.708 --> 37:31.342
Like you said, I spent $2 million on it,
I think I'll keep it.

37:31.915 --> 37:33.288
Why are you acting like this?

37:33.313 --> 37:36.059
Me? What about you?

37:36.084 --> 37:37.859
Are you really Barbara Kean's
errand girl now?

37:37.916 --> 37:39.883
I'm her partner.

37:39.918 --> 37:42.751
But if I don't give her this knife back,

37:42.821 --> 37:45.384
she won't ever see me as an equal.

37:47.773 --> 37:50.759
So I'm asking you to do me a solid.

37:51.399 --> 37:53.296
I'm sorry, Selina.

37:53.970 --> 37:55.759
You should go.

37:56.001 --> 37:58.268
(scoffs)

38:21.210 --> 38:22.777
Morning, Harv.

38:22.892 --> 38:24.494
Jim, hey.

38:25.258 --> 38:26.591
This is Detective Harper.

38:26.616 --> 38:28.498
She just transferred over from the 3-5.

38:28.922 --> 38:31.000
- Jim Gordon.
- Nice to meet you, Detective.

38:31.086 --> 38:33.036
- Heard a lot of good things.
- From who?

38:33.071 --> 38:35.426
It's good to have you
in the fold, Harper.

38:35.497 --> 38:36.485
Thanks.

38:40.677 --> 38:42.091
ALVAREZ: Gordon.

38:42.126 --> 38:44.220
You got a visitor.

38:44.762 --> 38:46.626
BULLOCK: Hot damn.

38:46.764 --> 38:48.664
Fox in the henhouse.

38:49.135 --> 38:50.368
No offense, Harper.

38:50.514 --> 38:51.747
HARPER: None taken.

38:53.686 --> 38:54.986
But you got the wrong idiom, Captain.

38:55.052 --> 38:56.218
No, I don't.

38:56.316 --> 38:57.917
Be right back.

39:00.511 --> 39:02.311
Sofia.

39:02.894 --> 39:04.431
What are you doing here?

39:04.615 --> 39:06.148
I came to help you.

39:06.538 --> 39:07.970
Oh, yeah? How's that?

39:07.995 --> 39:09.361
Penguin.

39:09.611 --> 39:11.719
Oh, I know you didn't directly ask me,

39:11.744 --> 39:13.522
but I find men tend to have trouble

39:13.547 --> 39:16.125
seeing the simple solution even
when it's presented to them.

39:16.160 --> 39:17.660
You shouldn't have come back here.

39:18.796 --> 39:21.395
Oh, Jim.

39:21.632 --> 39:23.599
(exhales) I don't need your permission.

39:23.872 --> 39:25.543
Or my father's.

39:25.779 --> 39:26.944
I'm a Falcone.

39:27.028 --> 39:28.700
This city is my birthright.

39:28.873 --> 39:32.608
My father might not think
I'm ready, but I am.

39:32.643 --> 39:34.210
Is that so?

39:35.674 --> 39:37.592
What do you think
I've been doing down south

39:37.617 --> 39:39.768
the past ten years?

39:44.052 --> 39:45.551
You knew you were coming back

39:45.576 --> 39:47.523
from the moment
I left your father's house.

39:48.108 --> 39:49.723
Everything that's happened was what?

39:49.803 --> 39:51.770
You sizing me up?

39:51.814 --> 39:53.455
No.

39:53.583 --> 39:55.583
Not everything.

39:57.020 --> 39:59.654
But I had to get to know you
if we're gonna work together.

39:59.689 --> 40:00.855
We're not.

40:00.890 --> 40:02.790
Don't be sore, Jim.

40:02.825 --> 40:06.237
You came looking for a gangster,
that's exactly what you found.

40:07.597 --> 40:10.370
We can do great things
together, you and I.

40:11.100 --> 40:13.100
I'll be in touch.

40:19.517 --> 40:21.007
You?

40:21.344 --> 40:23.079
You were the one who stole from me?

40:23.493 --> 40:25.473
MYRTLE: Some good it did.

40:25.615 --> 40:27.567
The ice broke his brain.

40:27.684 --> 40:29.364
What are you talking about?

40:29.419 --> 40:32.036
What's green and red
and goes round and round?

40:32.178 --> 40:34.088
Frog in a blender.

40:34.169 --> 40:35.356
Exactly.

40:35.391 --> 40:37.592
Ed couldn't even get that.

40:37.627 --> 40:38.790
Hmm.

40:38.922 --> 40:43.024
It does seem unlike Ed
to keep this rube alive.

40:43.623 --> 40:46.557
Sound the word: I want him found.

40:46.703 --> 40:48.732
And her?

40:49.107 --> 40:51.274
A lot of people have been
trying to steal from me lately.

40:51.380 --> 40:53.614
An example needs to be made.

40:54.115 --> 40:56.544
Have fun, Victor.

41:02.418 --> 41:05.219
(cocks)

41:05.254 --> 41:06.621
Love your dress.

41:06.656 --> 41:08.055
Thank you.

41:08.091 --> 41:09.893
I made it.

41:10.093 --> 41:11.392
Hmm.

41:11.427 --> 41:13.427
- (gunshot)
- (wings flapping)

41:27.176 --> 41:29.176
(exhales)

41:31.180 --> 41:33.180
(panting)

41:51.434 --> 41:52.500
(grunting)

41:59.731 --> 42:02.369
Excellent technique, Barbara.

42:02.512 --> 42:04.072
I'm impressed.

42:04.666 --> 42:06.608
- I had a good teacher.
- (chuckles)

42:06.799 --> 42:08.883
I wish you'd have called ahead.

42:10.887 --> 42:12.992
- (grunting)
- (bones crunching)

42:13.054 --> 42:15.460
Does that mean you don't have the knife?

42:15.825 --> 42:18.624
No, Bruce Wayne has it.

42:19.028 --> 42:20.617
Bruce.

42:21.335 --> 42:23.241
Really?

42:24.300 --> 42:26.327
How interesting.

42:26.903 --> 42:28.369
You're not angry?

42:28.404 --> 42:29.537
No, not at all.

42:29.572 --> 42:31.138
You see, Barbara,

42:31.174 --> 42:33.547
when I bathed you in the Lazarus Pit,

42:33.710 --> 42:36.140
I did it in the knowledge
that you would become

42:36.349 --> 42:38.149
a competent ally of mine.

42:38.247 --> 42:39.914
And so far,

42:40.049 --> 42:42.156
you've done an admirable job.

42:45.088 --> 42:47.088
I'm glad you feel that way.

42:48.962 --> 42:51.401
And I wouldn't worry about that knife.

42:52.263 --> 42:54.463
Didn't seem all that special to me.

42:54.546 --> 42:57.580
Oh, but you couldn't be more wrong.

42:57.897 --> 42:59.587
You see,

43:00.069 --> 43:05.333
that knife is the key to everything.

43:08.578 --> 43:09.943
Well, not everything.
