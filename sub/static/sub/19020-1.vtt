01:44.871 --> 01:46.805
(horns honking)

02:06.026 --> 02:07.626
Hi, Mr. Quinette.

02:07.694 --> 02:08.994
Whoa!

02:09.062 --> 02:10.229
Come here!

02:10.295 --> 02:13.065
Come on back up!
I got one for you.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.066
Really?

02:14.134 --> 02:16.068
Yeah!

02:17.170 --> 02:18.604
(grunts)

02:21.174 --> 02:22.741
Here.

02:22.809 --> 02:24.109
Thanks.

02:24.177 --> 02:26.111
No problem,<i> hombre.</i>

02:29.049 --> 02:32.317
MAN:
Nope, still fours.

02:32.385 --> 02:33.852
Pair of kings.

02:33.920 --> 02:35.587
Who knows? And... crap.

02:35.655 --> 02:37.923
Kings bet.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.925
Five.

02:44.964 --> 02:46.532
(chips clatter)

02:46.599 --> 02:48.734
God, what the fuck are
you doing in this hand?

02:48.802 --> 02:50.002
What?

02:50.070 --> 02:51.103
For the last three hours,

02:51.171 --> 02:53.238
you've been playing
cards like a moron.

02:53.306 --> 02:54.573
Yeah, I know.

02:54.641 --> 02:57.576
Hey, uh... what does
"cotillion" mean?

02:57.644 --> 02:59.878
I don't know.
A flower?

02:59.946 --> 03:01.146
Yeah? I don't know.

03:01.214 --> 03:02.348
Dance, it's
a dance class.

03:02.415 --> 03:03.816
Can we have the
next card, please?

03:03.883 --> 03:06.418
Take it easy,
Randolph.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.190
Twenty.

03:11.257 --> 03:13.192
Call.

03:21.234 --> 03:22.001
Twenty.

03:22.068 --> 03:24.036
Up 20.

03:24.104 --> 03:26.972
Up 20 again.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.308
Up 60.

03:30.410 --> 03:31.677
Fine.

03:33.413 --> 03:35.114
Full house.
Kings full.

03:37.717 --> 03:39.718
Four fours.

03:39.786 --> 03:41.687
Oh, for fuck's sake!

03:41.755 --> 03:42.688
(groans)

03:42.756 --> 03:44.056
You should never go
up against her.

03:44.124 --> 03:45.224
She's already got
your new truck.

03:45.291 --> 03:46.658
No, she does not
have my truck.

03:46.726 --> 03:47.659
Well, she's driving it.

03:47.727 --> 03:48.827
All right, cash me.

03:48.895 --> 03:50.362
She rivered the four,
for fuck's sake!

03:50.430 --> 03:51.497
Yeah.

03:51.564 --> 03:52.765
Well, that is fucking
ridiculous.

03:52.832 --> 03:54.600
I know, I'm not proud of it,
but there it is.

03:54.668 --> 03:57.069
(sighs)

03:57.137 --> 03:58.270
I gotta go.

03:58.338 --> 03:59.505
Oh, great, now she scats.

03:59.572 --> 04:01.774
No, I said I was going
an hour ago.

04:01.841 --> 04:05.511
Okay, thanks for the game,
and thanks for the vocab help.

04:05.578 --> 04:07.046
Play a few more hands
and I'll go with you.

04:07.113 --> 04:08.647
I can't; I got
to go to the city.

04:08.715 --> 04:09.815
Right.
Drive safe.

04:09.883 --> 04:10.816
Yep.

04:10.884 --> 04:12.151
Take care
of my truck.

04:12.218 --> 04:14.153
It's not your truck.

04:17.524 --> 04:20.125
(dog barks in distance)

04:34.741 --> 04:37.543
# #

04:51.624 --> 04:53.559
(door creaks)

04:55.028 --> 04:55.961
Hi, Sal.

04:56.029 --> 04:56.962
Hey!

04:57.030 --> 04:58.263
Still open?

04:58.331 --> 05:00.833
Not really, but I'll
get you a beer.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.234
Thanks.

05:08.274 --> 05:09.775
Thanks.

05:12.612 --> 05:15.714
How are things?

05:15.782 --> 05:18.017
(sighs):
Tired.

05:18.084 --> 05:19.651
You going to the city?

05:19.719 --> 05:22.287
Yeah, got a little
ahead of myself.

05:22.355 --> 05:23.655
(billiard balls clacking)

05:38.004 --> 05:40.005
(sportscast playing
indistinctly)

05:44.878 --> 05:45.978
You keep watching us.

05:46.046 --> 05:48.280
Yeah.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.849
You want to play?

05:50.917 --> 05:52.618
What do you
usually play for?

05:52.686 --> 05:54.019
Five bucks a rack.

05:56.589 --> 05:59.024
You know what?
(sighs)

05:59.092 --> 06:02.795
I got to be in the city soon,
so, uh, how about 20 a rack?

06:02.862 --> 06:04.596
And I'll give a lot of weight.

06:25.585 --> 06:26.585
(soft knock at door)

06:28.221 --> 06:30.689
Dad, I got to go
to school early today.

06:30.757 --> 06:33.158
(sighs)

06:33.226 --> 06:35.060
What time is it?

06:35.128 --> 06:36.195
Morning, Gulls.

06:36.262 --> 06:38.397
Morning.
It's like 7:00, but remember,

06:38.465 --> 06:40.866
I told you we have to do
a project in English class?

06:40.934 --> 06:42.101
Yeah.

06:42.168 --> 06:43.435
So, I gotta go.

06:43.503 --> 06:44.470
Okay.

07:00.320 --> 07:03.889
# #

07:09.963 --> 07:11.530
Oh!

07:12.766 --> 07:14.366
(giggling): Crap, Mom.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.937
Hi, Gulls.

07:19.005 --> 07:20.773
Get off the
sidewalk, will ya?

07:20.840 --> 07:23.742
Yeah, in a couple years,
when you're taller.

07:23.810 --> 07:27.112
But not yet.

07:27.180 --> 07:28.714
What's this?

07:28.782 --> 07:30.449
I just
busted my hand.

07:30.517 --> 07:31.850
How'd you do that?

07:31.918 --> 07:34.119
Just fell.

07:34.187 --> 07:35.587
You didn't
write me about it.

07:35.655 --> 07:36.889
It's not a big deal.

07:36.956 --> 07:39.458
What, don't kids
sign casts anymore?

07:39.526 --> 07:41.894
Not really.

07:41.961 --> 07:43.829
And this is what
you have to wear?

07:43.897 --> 07:45.898
Yeah, sixth grade.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.766
Coming down the street, I
thought maybe you'd become

07:47.834 --> 07:49.601
a lawyer
or something.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.205
So, how's sixth grade?

07:53.273 --> 07:55.708
You know, now I'm the youngest
in middle school,

07:55.775 --> 07:59.111
instead of the oldest in lower,
so... you know, it's cool.

07:59.179 --> 08:01.113
You mean, you're
picked on a bit?

08:01.181 --> 08:02.681
Yeah, sometimes.

08:02.749 --> 08:05.117
Is that how you got
your hand busted?

08:05.185 --> 08:07.152
Nuh-uh.
I just fell.

08:09.422 --> 08:14.293
Okay, well, uh... don't pick
back too much, okay?

08:14.361 --> 08:15.728
I got a letter for you.

08:15.795 --> 08:17.796
Oh, that's great, Gulls.
You know that I had to

08:17.864 --> 08:19.431
look up "Cotillion"
from your last one.

08:19.499 --> 08:20.766
Yeah? That's horrible.

08:20.834 --> 08:24.303
So, what else... what else
is middle school like?

08:24.371 --> 08:26.705
Well, it's
kind of the same.

08:26.773 --> 08:29.708
It's boring. I have to read
<i>Johnny Tremain.</i>

08:29.776 --> 08:31.844
What's that about?

08:31.911 --> 08:33.712
This kid who makes silver bowls
with Paul Revere

08:33.780 --> 08:35.780
and gets his hand burned.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.817
You like it?

08:38.885 --> 08:40.352
It's okay. Not really.

08:40.419 --> 08:41.687
I can't finish it.

08:41.755 --> 08:44.390
Yeah, and anyway,
silversmithing

08:44.457 --> 08:47.192
will probably get in the
way of your lawyering.

08:47.260 --> 08:48.527
Yeah.

08:51.731 --> 08:53.165
How's your dad and Ellen?

08:53.233 --> 08:55.501
Fine.

08:55.568 --> 08:57.736
Yeah, you like her
any better now?

08:57.804 --> 08:59.238
She's okay.

08:59.305 --> 09:00.572
She's a pretty good cook,

09:00.640 --> 09:03.709
but she gets angry
about the weirdest things.

09:03.777 --> 09:05.444
Like what?

09:05.512 --> 09:08.347
Like sometimes, after
I wash my hands,

09:08.415 --> 09:09.982
she says I leave
the soap dirty.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.250
What does that mean?

09:11.317 --> 09:13.752
I know. It means I'm supposed
to wash the soap

09:13.820 --> 09:16.388
after I wash my hands.

09:16.456 --> 09:17.990
(giggling)

09:18.058 --> 09:19.525
Well...

09:19.592 --> 09:24.396
But sometimes when she talks to
her friends, she says things.

09:24.464 --> 09:25.864
Like what?

09:25.932 --> 09:28.934
Like once I heard her say--
about you, I guess--

09:29.002 --> 09:33.372
that they wanted you
to get a... annulment?

09:33.440 --> 09:34.940
That who wanted?

09:35.008 --> 09:37.943
I guess Dad and Grandma.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.445
Oh.

09:39.512 --> 09:41.447
And I asked Eric
Muftie what that was,

09:41.514 --> 09:43.349
and he said it was
something dirty.

09:43.416 --> 09:44.350
A sex thing.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.552
Who's Eric Muftie?

09:46.619 --> 09:48.420
A kid in my class.

09:48.488 --> 09:50.522
Well, Eric is wrong.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.024
Good.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.726
It's-It's not a...
it's not a sex thing at all.

09:53.793 --> 09:54.727
Good.

09:54.794 --> 09:57.796
It's sort of like a...

09:57.864 --> 09:59.565
Sort of the same
thing as a divorce.

09:59.632 --> 10:01.500
Oh.

10:01.568 --> 10:03.769
You already got one.

10:05.839 --> 10:08.040
You don't really need to worry
about it, okay?

10:08.108 --> 10:09.274
Okay.

10:09.342 --> 10:11.110
I promise you,
Eric is wrong.

10:11.177 --> 10:12.111
Good.

10:12.178 --> 10:13.912
It's not a dirty
thing at all.

10:13.980 --> 10:15.981
Okay.

10:16.049 --> 10:17.182
Here's your letter.

10:18.518 --> 10:20.619
Thanks, Gulls.
Got to get going.

10:26.993 --> 10:28.827
Why can't you just
write to me at home?

10:28.895 --> 10:30.295
Why? You don't
like Mr. Quinette?

10:30.363 --> 10:32.731
He's nice, but sometimes
he isn't there.

10:32.799 --> 10:34.299
So I think maybe
I missed one.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.001
No, if there's a
letter, he'll be there.

10:36.069 --> 10:37.736
Okay.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.672
I think it's a pretty cool
system, don't you?

10:39.739 --> 10:40.673
I guess.

10:40.740 --> 10:41.674
A secret system.

10:41.741 --> 10:42.808
Yeah.

10:42.876 --> 10:46.111
Gulls, you got to keep it
a secret, okay?

10:46.179 --> 10:47.446
I know.

10:47.514 --> 10:48.947
And after you read
one of my letters,

10:49.015 --> 10:50.449
make sure to just
throw them away, okay?

10:50.517 --> 10:51.984
I do.

10:52.052 --> 10:53.619
Good.

10:53.687 --> 10:54.853
Okay, tell me more.

10:54.921 --> 10:56.855
Are you on a team?
- Yeah.

10:56.923 --> 10:58.023
Soccer, but B team.

10:58.091 --> 10:59.425
What position?
- Left wing.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.592
Left wing. Really?

11:00.660 --> 11:01.860
That's pretty hard, right?

11:01.928 --> 11:04.730
You got to be kicking
with your left foot a lot.

11:04.798 --> 11:06.098
Yeah.
- How are you?

11:06.166 --> 11:08.934
Okay. I mean, it's B team,
so it's mostly 'tards.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.804
Well, better to be a big
fish in a small pond.

11:11.871 --> 11:14.206
Even if all the other fish
are 'tard fish?

11:14.274 --> 11:18.644
Yeah. Even then.

11:18.712 --> 11:20.346
I, uh...

11:20.413 --> 11:22.181
I should stop here.

11:22.248 --> 11:24.383
When are you coming back?

11:24.451 --> 11:26.952
Well, it'll be sooner
than last time.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.320
Probably a couple of weeks.

11:28.388 --> 11:29.588
Two weeks?

11:29.656 --> 11:31.123
Probably three.
- No, four.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.491
No, definitely not four.

11:32.559 --> 11:34.059
But send me
letters, okay?

11:34.127 --> 11:35.627
Okay.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.401
Okay.

11:44.904 --> 11:46.572
Keep your nose
clean, kid.

11:46.639 --> 11:48.574
Okay.

11:48.641 --> 11:51.377
Okay. I love you, Gulls.

11:51.444 --> 11:52.578
Me, too.

11:52.645 --> 11:54.213
Mm. Okay.

11:54.280 --> 11:55.514
Now, go on.

11:55.582 --> 11:56.682
(sniffles)

11:56.750 --> 11:57.983
I'll see you soon, okay?

11:58.051 --> 11:59.218
Couple of weeks?

11:59.285 --> 12:00.386
Yeah, a couple.

12:00.453 --> 12:01.720
And try reading that
<i>Johnny</i>, uh,

12:01.788 --> 12:03.856
what's-his-face book
one more time, okay?

12:03.923 --> 12:05.891
I can't, Mom.
I swear, it's horrible.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.092
(laughs)

12:07.160 --> 12:09.228
Forget it. Forget it.

12:09.295 --> 12:11.030
Go on, don't be late.

12:11.097 --> 12:13.098
Okay.

12:34.354 --> 12:35.521
(bus hissing)

12:39.859 --> 12:42.327
(horn honking)

13:08.855 --> 13:11.890
(door squeaking)

13:12.992 --> 13:15.994
Kailey, Jesus.

13:16.062 --> 13:17.930
Look at you.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.302
I know, I know,
I know.

13:23.370 --> 13:25.137
I've been up for a few days.

13:25.205 --> 13:26.672
I'm not so sure

13:26.740 --> 13:29.241
it's the long
hours hurting you.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.243
Yeah.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.747
Well, I see Gulley
every day.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.782
He looks good.

13:36.850 --> 13:39.418
I saw him
this morning.

13:39.486 --> 13:42.354
His arm's broken.

13:42.422 --> 13:43.989
I saw that.

13:44.057 --> 13:45.157
It's okay.

13:45.225 --> 13:47.192
Yeah. He's
doing great.

13:47.260 --> 13:49.461
He's a good kid.

13:51.331 --> 13:52.698
(Kailey exhales)

13:52.766 --> 13:54.066
Is there a game around?

13:54.134 --> 13:55.668
You see anything?

13:55.735 --> 13:59.371
Even if there
were, I mean...

13:59.439 --> 14:01.306
you're a mess.

14:01.374 --> 14:03.108
You got enough
for hotel room?

14:03.176 --> 14:07.046
Yeah, but, uh, I'd rather
use it to get a game.

14:07.113 --> 14:08.347
Want to sleep here a bit?

14:08.415 --> 14:09.715
You mind?

14:09.783 --> 14:11.216
Go ahead.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.052
Thanks.

14:13.119 --> 14:14.553
(sniffles)

14:14.621 --> 14:17.456
Come get me if there's something
I should be awake for, okay?

14:17.524 --> 14:19.525
Got you.

14:49.155 --> 14:51.123
# #

15:12.078 --> 15:14.913
How was that
English project?

15:14.981 --> 15:16.515
The what?

15:16.583 --> 15:19.018
That thing
you had to be in early for.

15:19.085 --> 15:20.953
Oh. It was good.

15:21.021 --> 15:22.955
Yeah? What book
was it on?

15:24.524 --> 15:26.492
Gulley?

15:26.559 --> 15:28.861
It wasn't
a book.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.863
It was...

15:31.931 --> 15:33.632
We had to make
an advertisement.

15:33.700 --> 15:34.900
Oh. For what?

15:34.968 --> 15:36.635
Well, everybody got
different things.

15:36.703 --> 15:37.803
What did you get?

15:37.871 --> 15:38.971
Hot chocolate.
- Huh.

15:39.039 --> 15:40.139
In English class?

15:40.206 --> 15:41.473
Why would they do that?

15:41.541 --> 15:42.841
I don't know.

15:42.909 --> 15:44.476
They didn't
give you a reason?

15:44.544 --> 15:46.412
No, they did.

15:49.616 --> 15:52.384
Well, what was it?

15:52.452 --> 15:53.585
Gulls, your dad's
talking to you.

15:53.653 --> 15:54.787
Don't call me Gulls.

15:54.854 --> 15:55.888
Hey.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.456
Lose the tone, young man.

15:57.524 --> 15:59.458
Now, what was
the reason?

16:00.727 --> 16:02.761
My teacher says

16:02.829 --> 16:06.565
that poets sometimes make
advertisements for money.

16:06.633 --> 16:10.269
So, instead of writing
a poem, we could do an ad.

16:10.337 --> 16:11.670
Hmm.

16:11.738 --> 16:14.106
Swear to God,
if it was up to me,

16:14.174 --> 16:16.575
you'd be in
public school so fast.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.377
So, how'd you do?

16:18.445 --> 16:19.978
We won.
- You did?

16:20.046 --> 16:21.547
With hot chocolate?
- Yeah.

16:21.614 --> 16:23.415
Well, what
was your ad?

16:23.483 --> 16:25.551
We made a picture
of some mountains

16:25.618 --> 16:28.020
with a cottage and smoke
coming out of the chimney,

16:28.088 --> 16:29.822
and we called it
Jungfrau Hot Chocolate.

16:29.889 --> 16:30.989
(giggling)

16:31.057 --> 16:32.524
Jungfrau. What's that?

16:32.592 --> 16:34.159
It's a mountain in Switzerland.

16:35.495 --> 16:36.495
No, it isn't.

16:36.563 --> 16:37.696
Yes, it is.

16:37.764 --> 16:39.665
Jungfrau?

16:39.733 --> 16:40.966
Yeah.

16:50.377 --> 16:52.945
(whispers):
It's nice you won.

17:06.092 --> 17:08.527
It's not pronounced that way.

17:08.595 --> 17:09.560
But it's real?

17:09.628 --> 17:11.864
But it's pronounced Yung Frow.

17:11.931 --> 17:13.665
But it exists.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.134
Not pronounced that way,
it doesn't.

17:17.436 --> 17:19.637
(clock ticking)

17:19.705 --> 17:22.174
(distant siren)

17:22.242 --> 17:24.108
(door opening)

17:25.211 --> 17:26.811
Hey.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.814
Hi.

17:31.985 --> 17:33.919
Do me a favor, okay?

17:33.987 --> 17:35.421
Sure.

17:35.488 --> 17:38.090
Maybe don't lecture me
on mountains in Switzerland.

17:38.158 --> 17:40.159
I-I didn't think...

17:40.226 --> 17:42.361
You might think you know
everything under the sun,

17:42.429 --> 17:43.595
but trust me, you don't.

17:43.663 --> 17:45.864
I know.

17:45.932 --> 17:47.199
Just don't
lecture me.

17:47.267 --> 17:48.834
Think you can
handle that?

17:48.902 --> 17:51.670
Okay.

17:54.107 --> 17:55.240
Terrific.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.948
(pool balls clacking)

18:03.016 --> 18:05.250
(footsteps approaching)

18:05.318 --> 18:06.919
Well, good morning.

18:06.986 --> 18:08.454
Hey.

18:08.521 --> 18:10.022
How'd you sleep?
- Terrific.

18:14.627 --> 18:16.128
Place looks a little better.

18:16.196 --> 18:17.463
Oh, yeah.

18:17.530 --> 18:19.298
It's great for
a week night.

18:19.366 --> 18:22.234
(sighs)

18:22.302 --> 18:24.136
There a game here?

18:24.204 --> 18:26.105
Yeah, maybe.

18:26.172 --> 18:27.639
That kid in the
stupid track suit--

18:27.707 --> 18:30.109
he'll play you.

18:30.176 --> 18:33.178
But he only plays
ten dollar racks.

18:33.246 --> 18:35.247
That won't even be gas money.

18:37.017 --> 18:38.784
Who are the guys
playing one pocket?

18:38.852 --> 18:40.953
The older guy

18:41.021 --> 18:42.888
is Duncan.

18:42.956 --> 18:45.090
The other fella--
I don't know his name.

18:45.158 --> 18:46.291
He's gonna quit soon.

18:46.359 --> 18:48.660
I ain't never seen him
won a game yet.

18:48.728 --> 18:49.962
Okay. I'll try for Duncan.

18:50.030 --> 18:52.264
That's gonna
be a hard

18:52.332 --> 18:53.699
game to get.

18:53.767 --> 18:54.900
He's good.

18:54.968 --> 18:57.936
He'll also try
to negotiate weight.

18:58.004 --> 19:00.506
Should I give him any?

19:00.573 --> 19:01.740
No! He's good.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.075
All right, I'll be

19:03.143 --> 19:04.176
back in an hour.

19:04.244 --> 19:05.811
Keep him here
if he wants a game.

19:05.879 --> 19:08.113
(rain falling)

19:38.244 --> 19:40.779
# #

19:44.451 --> 19:46.618
(horns honking)

19:47.854 --> 19:49.788
(coins clinking)

19:55.562 --> 19:58.163
Hey, is Markus there?

19:58.231 --> 20:00.165
You got a number for him?

20:02.002 --> 20:04.703
Okay, well, uh,
maybe if you run into him.

20:04.771 --> 20:07.573
I know, but maybe
if you just happen to see him,

20:07.640 --> 20:09.942
can you tell him
that Kailey's in the city,

20:10.010 --> 20:11.610
and to keep an eye out?

20:11.678 --> 20:15.447
Kailey. K-A-I-L-E-Y.

20:15.515 --> 20:17.516
He'll know.

20:20.987 --> 20:23.655
(door creaking open)

20:23.723 --> 20:25.657
For Gulls tomorrow.

20:35.402 --> 20:36.568
You Duncan?

20:36.636 --> 20:38.070
I am, yeah.

20:38.138 --> 20:40.172
Kailey.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.540
It's nice to meet you.

20:41.608 --> 20:43.475
Want to play
some one pocket?

20:43.543 --> 20:44.910
Maybe. For what?

20:44.978 --> 20:47.346
I don't know.

20:47.414 --> 20:49.214
20 a game.

20:49.282 --> 20:52.117
Okay. Give me two balls.

20:52.185 --> 20:54.486
(laughs)
No. Can't.

20:54.554 --> 20:56.755
Quinn says I can't
give any weight.

20:56.823 --> 20:58.023
He does, huh?

20:58.091 --> 21:00.459
He does, and
he's a fair guy.

21:00.527 --> 21:02.127
Is he staking you?

21:02.195 --> 21:04.530
No.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.532
Okay.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.500
Maybe. But he's wrong.

21:08.568 --> 21:10.135
I don't know.

21:10.203 --> 21:12.404
Seemed to play okay
earlier tonight.

21:12.472 --> 21:14.006
I was playing
against Mike Simms.

21:14.074 --> 21:15.240
Play him every week.

21:15.308 --> 21:16.809
Beat him every week.

21:16.876 --> 21:18.944
He's a degenerate.
He loves to lose.

21:19.012 --> 21:20.946
It's no reflection.

21:22.115 --> 21:24.249
How about no weight,

21:24.317 --> 21:26.952
but a guaranteed renegotiation
after five games?

21:27.020 --> 21:29.054
Okay, but we play
for a hundred a rack.

21:29.122 --> 21:31.523
Okay.

21:31.591 --> 21:33.992
Lack for break.

21:34.060 --> 21:35.894
No, I'll give you the break.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.429
I'll take
the right pocket.

22:03.223 --> 22:06.158
# #

22:21.307 --> 22:22.508
Seven ball.

22:52.305 --> 22:54.740
# #

23:25.271 --> 23:27.206
# #

23:56.302 --> 23:58.437
# #

24:09.749 --> 24:10.949
KAILEY:
Nice games.

24:11.017 --> 24:12.951
Maybe you should be
giving me a ball.

24:13.019 --> 24:15.087
Nope.
- But out, Quinn.

24:15.155 --> 24:16.488
I'll give her a ball.

24:16.556 --> 24:17.790
Nope, she's gonna quit.

24:20.527 --> 24:22.428
What the fuck Quinn?!

24:22.495 --> 24:24.329
You pull me off a game
just when the dipshit's

24:24.397 --> 24:25.964
about to give me a ball?!

24:26.032 --> 24:27.833
Jesus fucking shit!

24:27.901 --> 24:30.202
He ain't a dipshit.
He still would've took ya.

24:30.270 --> 24:31.804
Fuck you.

24:31.871 --> 24:33.038
Oh, fuck yourself.

24:33.106 --> 24:34.907
You're playing like shit, Kai.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.308
I know it. You know it.

24:36.376 --> 24:37.376
You're wrong.
- No.

24:37.444 --> 24:39.345
I easily had the last game.

24:39.412 --> 24:41.447
You barely got the last game.
I don't know what's

24:41.514 --> 24:43.449
on your mind, but,
you know, you're not

24:43.516 --> 24:45.217
playing half-way decent.

24:45.285 --> 24:46.318
Where are you going?

24:46.386 --> 24:47.686
To find a fucking game.

24:47.754 --> 24:49.988
Well, go get it.

24:53.960 --> 24:55.994
Kai! Kai!

25:00.900 --> 25:02.301
I thought you
hated this city.

25:02.369 --> 25:04.470
More and more
every fucking day.

25:04.537 --> 25:05.704
How are you Markus?

25:05.772 --> 25:06.939
I'm all right.

25:07.007 --> 25:09.041
Uh, I'm not really a
running kind of guy, so...

25:09.109 --> 25:10.342
(panting)

25:10.410 --> 25:12.011
Thank you.

25:12.078 --> 25:14.813
Oh, what are you doing in town?

25:14.881 --> 25:16.415
Trying to get out.

25:16.483 --> 25:19.685
Oh, that should be easy enough.
- No.

25:19.753 --> 25:21.887
Really out.
Oh.

25:21.955 --> 25:24.356
I'm thinking Canada out.

25:24.424 --> 25:27.526
Oh.
You could do that, right?

25:27.594 --> 25:29.361
I could, yeah.

25:29.429 --> 25:31.363
How much would that be?

25:31.431 --> 25:32.531
$10,000, thereabout...

25:32.599 --> 25:33.766
There'll be two of us.

25:33.833 --> 25:35.868
Twenty.

25:35.935 --> 25:38.237
He's a kid.

25:38.304 --> 25:40.773
Oh, that's...
that's different, Kai.

25:40.840 --> 25:42.107
Yeah, I figured.

25:42.175 --> 25:44.343
No, I mean, that's
really different.

25:44.411 --> 25:46.078
I can get you
a passport,

25:46.146 --> 25:48.380
get you into Canada,
no problem, but...

25:48.448 --> 25:49.748
traveling with a kid?

25:49.816 --> 25:51.750
<i>That is way different.</i>

25:51.818 --> 25:54.853
They look hard-- single
adults traveling with kids.

25:54.921 --> 25:57.423
Passport'd have to be
fucking bomb-proof.

25:57.490 --> 25:59.491
Can you still do it?

26:02.062 --> 26:03.996
Maybe, uh...

26:04.064 --> 26:05.397
the price goes up.

26:05.465 --> 26:07.132
How much up?

26:07.200 --> 26:08.233
Fifty, at least.

26:14.240 --> 26:15.541
How long?

26:15.608 --> 26:17.543
Couple of weeks.

26:22.248 --> 26:23.515
Let's do it.

26:23.583 --> 26:25.384
Where are you going?

26:25.452 --> 26:27.353
To raise your fucking money.

26:27.420 --> 26:29.188
What about Mexico?

26:29.255 --> 26:31.457
I don't speak Spanish, Markus.

26:31.524 --> 26:33.459
Mexico's nice.

26:47.607 --> 26:50.376
# #

26:54.981 --> 26:56.582
(indistinct chatter)

27:05.892 --> 27:07.960
Hey, uh...

27:08.028 --> 27:09.561
Jameson neat, water back.

27:17.137 --> 27:18.837
(glass clinks)

27:18.905 --> 27:20.839
Thanks.

27:26.746 --> 27:28.847
(footsteps approaching)

27:28.915 --> 27:30.849
WOMAN:
Four Buds.

27:32.585 --> 27:34.119
Are those guys your boyfriends?

27:35.588 --> 27:37.523
What?

27:37.590 --> 27:39.158
Why don't you invite
me on your team?

27:39.225 --> 27:41.360
What?

27:41.428 --> 27:42.361
Invite me on your team.

27:42.429 --> 27:43.629
Why?

27:43.697 --> 27:45.230
Because it might
be fun to beat them.

27:48.668 --> 27:51.537
Take my place.

27:51.604 --> 27:53.272
Really?

27:53.340 --> 27:55.941
Yeah. Fucking hate this game.

27:57.444 --> 27:59.978
That guy your boyfriend?

28:00.046 --> 28:01.980
Depends on who you ask.

28:02.048 --> 28:04.049
I suppose I'll ask you.

28:04.117 --> 28:06.385
Nope.

28:06.453 --> 28:08.921
Okay, then.

28:12.525 --> 28:14.393
She's playing for Kat.

28:14.461 --> 28:15.527
What?

28:15.595 --> 28:17.496
She's on my team.
Okay.

28:17.564 --> 28:19.298
No, no, who the
fuck is this?

28:19.366 --> 28:21.400
Come on, let's play.
It'd be fun.

28:21.468 --> 28:23.369
Lady, this isn't, uh...

28:23.436 --> 28:24.536
like, you know,
an open thing.

28:24.604 --> 28:26.705
Come on. It'll be fun.

28:28.108 --> 28:29.675
Seriously.
Fuck off.

28:29.743 --> 28:31.043
No, Brad.

28:31.111 --> 28:33.212
Let her play.

28:33.279 --> 28:35.180
Okay. Here's, uh...

28:35.248 --> 28:36.849
hundred dollars.

28:36.916 --> 28:38.183
I'm gonna play you

28:38.251 --> 28:40.519
or the both of you.
I'm gonna play with--

28:40.587 --> 28:41.720
sorry, what's your name again?
Charlotte.

28:41.788 --> 28:43.489
Charlotte here...
and we'll beat you.

28:44.958 --> 28:47.459
Okay.

28:47.527 --> 28:49.228
But, uh, both
of us play you.

28:49.295 --> 28:51.764
Sure. Do you
have a hundred dollars?

28:51.831 --> 28:54.199
(chuckles):
Bitch.

28:54.267 --> 28:55.367
Nice talk.

28:55.435 --> 28:56.502
Go ahead and break.

29:14.220 --> 29:16.221
Fuck!

29:16.289 --> 29:17.723
Do you want to go?

29:17.791 --> 29:19.558
You can.

29:19.626 --> 29:20.926
Nah, go for it.

29:31.004 --> 29:33.605
Uh, take the three.
Which one?

29:33.673 --> 29:35.174
Just hit it right there,

29:35.241 --> 29:37.409
and it'll roll down the side.

29:44.150 --> 29:46.085
Sorry.

29:50.590 --> 29:51.724
Don't fucking choke.

29:51.791 --> 29:53.559
Just sink
a fucking ball.

29:57.430 --> 29:59.365
Oh!

30:29.396 --> 30:31.330
# #

30:43.209 --> 30:45.144
Fuck you!

30:46.246 --> 30:47.446
Fuck!

30:47.514 --> 30:49.281
Don't worry.
Just aim for my finger.

30:49.349 --> 30:51.283
Okay.

30:54.888 --> 30:57.022
Just aim for my finger.

31:07.634 --> 31:09.034
You're a fucking bitch.

31:09.102 --> 31:10.069
Take it easy, man.

31:10.136 --> 31:11.970
Get the fuck out of here.

31:12.038 --> 31:14.006
You owe me a hundred dollars.

31:14.074 --> 31:15.341
(sighs)

31:16.843 --> 31:18.510
You missed that shot on purpose.

31:18.578 --> 31:19.912
Probably.

31:19.979 --> 31:22.915
You still owe me
a hundred dollars.

31:22.982 --> 31:24.650
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

31:24.718 --> 31:26.452
You fucking bitch!

31:37.464 --> 31:39.565
Is she here?

31:39.632 --> 31:40.799
No, why?

31:40.867 --> 31:42.735
Because it was
not mailed.

31:42.802 --> 31:45.404
Well, she gave me
that before she left.

31:46.773 --> 31:49.241
Oh. Hang around
if you'd like, kiddo.

31:51.478 --> 31:53.912
Okay.
(door creaking)

32:03.690 --> 32:05.624
What time is it?

32:05.692 --> 32:07.126
About 6:00.

32:07.193 --> 32:09.194
When?

32:09.262 --> 32:11.196
Wednesday afternoon.

32:15.435 --> 32:17.002
(groans):
What are you looking at?

32:17.070 --> 32:19.371
I'm just checking you out.

32:20.640 --> 32:22.007
I heard you're
not supposed

32:22.075 --> 32:23.742
to let someone
hit in the head

32:23.810 --> 32:25.611
sleep for very long,
but every time I try

32:25.679 --> 32:27.680
to wake you up,
you take a swing at me.

32:27.747 --> 32:28.947
So I thought I'd just...

32:29.015 --> 32:32.117
sit here and watch you.

32:32.185 --> 32:34.787
To see if I'd just
stop breathing?

32:39.592 --> 32:40.759
(groans)

32:40.827 --> 32:42.461
Don't need any stitches,
but I'd leave

32:42.529 --> 32:44.463
the bandage on.

32:47.400 --> 32:50.569
So what was that
about last night?

32:51.638 --> 32:53.572
I just wanted a game.

32:53.640 --> 32:55.274
You win?
- Yup.

32:55.342 --> 32:56.642
How much?

32:58.745 --> 33:00.312
You didn't win shit.

33:00.380 --> 33:01.647
Give me a break.

33:04.851 --> 33:06.418
What's that?

33:06.486 --> 33:08.354
About two thou.

33:08.421 --> 33:11.557
Enough for you
to get out of here and...

33:11.624 --> 33:13.425
catch a little rest.

33:13.493 --> 33:15.361
You're a mess.

33:15.428 --> 33:17.896
I know I'm a mess.

33:17.964 --> 33:19.365
(clattering)

33:19.432 --> 33:22.167
I got coldcocked
by some dipshit frat boy.

33:22.235 --> 33:24.203
I can't hustle a game
to save my life,

33:24.270 --> 33:25.804
I got blood all over my clothes,

33:25.872 --> 33:27.673
and I seem to be
throwing up a lot.

33:27.741 --> 33:28.941
I know I'm a mess, Quinn.

33:29.009 --> 33:31.710
What's that throwing up about?

33:31.778 --> 33:33.712
Nervous, I guess.

33:33.780 --> 33:35.848
What are you nervous about?

33:38.184 --> 33:40.619
I'm going to get him back.

33:41.888 --> 33:44.256
Kai, you don't even have
visitation rights

33:44.324 --> 33:46.225
let alone custody.

33:46.292 --> 33:47.393
I know.

33:47.460 --> 33:48.994
It would be kidnapping.

33:49.062 --> 33:50.229
I know.
(sighs)

33:50.296 --> 33:51.630
Eventually,
they'll come looking for you.

33:51.698 --> 33:52.898
Not eventually.

33:52.966 --> 33:54.767
I'll be the first person
they come looking for.

33:54.834 --> 33:57.169
I'm his mother.

34:00.106 --> 34:01.740
And I have a record.

34:01.808 --> 34:03.008
You do?

34:03.076 --> 34:05.678
Yep.
- What for?

34:05.745 --> 34:07.713
Running a card room.

34:07.781 --> 34:09.581
They put you in jail for that?

34:09.649 --> 34:10.815
180 days.

34:10.884 --> 34:12.117
Fuck!

34:12.185 --> 34:13.351
Small town.

34:13.420 --> 34:15.688
And one bitch came in
and made a huge racket.

34:15.755 --> 34:18.090
Who?

34:18.158 --> 34:20.826
Gulley's grandmother, Abigail.

34:22.661 --> 34:23.896
I worked in
a town bar,

34:23.963 --> 34:27.132
and I, uh...
had a card game in back.

34:27.199 --> 34:28.534
(sniffs)

34:28.601 --> 34:31.003
One side of town
was a little college

34:31.071 --> 34:32.638
with a bunch of rich kids

34:32.706 --> 34:35.373
who couldn't play for shit,
but they could drink.

34:35.442 --> 34:38.143
And the other side
was a... seminary

34:38.210 --> 34:40.846
with a few young men
who could do both,

34:40.914 --> 34:42.848
usually pretty well.

34:44.650 --> 34:47.719
Gulley's dad was from
the seminary side.

34:47.786 --> 34:50.389
You were dating a priest?

34:50.456 --> 34:51.924
He got kicked out.

34:53.760 --> 34:55.226
I got pregnant,

34:55.295 --> 34:58.497
and he proposed and...

34:58.565 --> 35:01.834
For a couple weeks
it was fantastic.

35:03.903 --> 35:06.805
I had this...

35:06.873 --> 35:09.508
funny, handsome
19-year-old husband,

35:09.576 --> 35:13.212
and I was going to be a mother.

35:15.482 --> 35:19.785
Then a shitstorm named
Abigail rolled in.

35:19.853 --> 35:21.720
Next thing I know,
David disappears,

35:21.788 --> 35:24.189
I get brought up
on a whole load of charges,

35:24.257 --> 35:27.593
and I'm now three months
pregnant.

35:30.230 --> 35:33.799
And Abby made me a deal.

35:33.867 --> 35:35.901
Give up the baby,
get a divorce,

35:35.969 --> 35:39.872
she'd do whatever she could
to make things easier.

35:42.742 --> 35:44.309
I couldn't say no.

35:44.377 --> 35:46.745
I mean, I was 25 years old.

35:46.813 --> 35:49.548
I was going to lose the kid
either way.

35:51.618 --> 35:55.254
So while I appreciate the cash,
it isn't going to be enough.

36:01.928 --> 36:03.862
You can't tell me
anymore about this.

36:03.930 --> 36:05.831
I know.

36:11.171 --> 36:13.839
I own the pool hall,

36:13.907 --> 36:15.908
the rent here is cheap.

36:15.975 --> 36:18.711
I'm just too old to start
fucking things up now.

36:20.780 --> 36:24.116
Can you help me
set up some games?

36:24.184 --> 36:26.151
How much you need?

36:26.219 --> 36:27.319
I-I don't know yet.

36:27.387 --> 36:29.088
I, uh...

36:29.155 --> 36:31.890
thinking around $60,000.

36:31.958 --> 36:33.459
Jesus!

36:33.526 --> 36:35.427
You going to offer me
a drink, or what?

36:37.263 --> 36:39.131
(glass clinking, liquid pouring)

36:43.069 --> 36:46.572
You can't raise that
by just grabbing games.

36:46.639 --> 36:48.007
(sniffs)
Okay.

36:48.074 --> 36:49.341
Did you think
you could?

36:49.409 --> 36:51.176
I hadn't really
thought that far.

36:51.244 --> 36:53.178
Ah, crap.

36:57.517 --> 37:00.319
What about that guy I you off?

37:00.387 --> 37:02.187
Duncan.

37:02.255 --> 37:03.355
Yeah.

37:03.423 --> 37:04.723
Maybe him.

37:04.791 --> 37:06.225
Okay.
- Yeah.

37:06.292 --> 37:07.559
Maybe.

37:07.627 --> 37:10.963
Listen, I don't want to know
anymore about it.

37:12.065 --> 37:14.667
(laughs softly):
Okay.

37:14.734 --> 37:17.169
(dishes clattering)

37:18.338 --> 37:20.439
ELLEN:
Gulley, come set the table.

37:20.507 --> 37:21.607
Okay.

37:21.675 --> 37:22.808
Use the nice napkins.

37:22.876 --> 37:24.109
Your grandma's
coming over.

37:24.177 --> 37:26.078
I know.

37:27.414 --> 37:29.581
I'm coming.

37:31.418 --> 37:34.119
Abby hasn't seen you for awhile
so maybe put on a nice shirt.

37:34.187 --> 37:35.621
Okay.

37:35.689 --> 37:37.823
Remember how I had
to work last weekend?

37:38.925 --> 37:40.526
I don't know.

37:40.593 --> 37:42.695
Well, I did
and we couldn't get to mass.

37:42.762 --> 37:43.862
Yeah.

37:43.930 --> 37:46.532
Well, Abby may ask,
and let's just...

37:46.599 --> 37:48.701
avoid it, okay?

37:48.768 --> 37:50.736
Sure.

37:50.804 --> 37:52.738
Okay.

37:54.007 --> 37:56.075
Go help Ellen.

37:56.142 --> 37:58.010
Okay.

38:14.961 --> 38:16.195
Ellen, this is good.

38:16.262 --> 38:17.296
What is this?

38:17.364 --> 38:18.497
It's called escarole.

38:18.565 --> 38:20.599
(metallic clank)

38:20.667 --> 38:22.468
(sighs)

38:25.071 --> 38:27.373
How's the world
of real estate?

38:27.440 --> 38:29.808
Busy. People always want
to buy new apartments.

38:29.876 --> 38:31.377
(sharp laugh)

38:31.444 --> 38:33.912
I wouldn't want people coming
and going through my house.

38:33.980 --> 38:36.115
It feels like snooping.

38:36.182 --> 38:37.816
I don't go through
their drawers.

38:37.884 --> 38:38.984
You look in their
closets, I bet.

38:39.052 --> 38:40.452
That's not snooping, Mom.

38:40.520 --> 38:42.955
I'm just doing my job.

38:47.394 --> 38:49.194
And school for you, Gulley?

38:49.262 --> 38:50.696
It's good.

38:50.764 --> 38:52.498
Good.

38:52.565 --> 38:54.466
(metallic clank)

38:56.036 --> 38:58.671
He won an English thing the
other day, didn't you, Gulls?

38:58.738 --> 38:59.838
Yeah.

38:59.906 --> 39:01.140
Well, I like that school.

39:01.207 --> 39:02.541
It's good, yeah.

39:02.609 --> 39:04.276
How are your catechism classes?

39:04.344 --> 39:05.811
They're fine.

39:05.879 --> 39:08.380
You work hard there, too.

39:08.448 --> 39:12.785
Remember what your grandfather
used to say?

39:12.852 --> 39:16.021
"You got to take the bitter
with the lousy."

39:17.123 --> 39:18.724
(laughing)

39:18.792 --> 39:20.826
Jesus!

39:20.894 --> 39:23.462
(laughing):
What a thing to remember.

39:25.565 --> 39:26.965
No.

39:27.033 --> 39:30.669
"Eternity is a hell
of a long time."

39:30.737 --> 39:32.304
Right.

39:32.372 --> 39:35.207
Seriously, Gulley,
apply yourself.

39:35.275 --> 39:37.676
I do.

39:37.744 --> 39:39.778
He could work harder.

39:44.217 --> 39:46.819
How was, uh, late
mass last week?

39:46.886 --> 39:48.354
It was fine.

39:48.421 --> 39:49.688
Who did the early?

39:49.756 --> 39:51.023
Cavanaugh.

39:51.091 --> 39:52.024
Really?

39:52.092 --> 39:53.992
We got Smoltz.

39:54.060 --> 39:56.261
Were there guitars?

39:56.329 --> 39:57.663
No.

39:57.731 --> 39:59.932
God, I hate those guitars.

40:00.000 --> 40:03.235
And then they start
singing the Lord's Prayer.

40:03.303 --> 40:05.971
I mean, what in hell do these
people think they're doing?

40:06.039 --> 40:07.172
I don't know.

40:08.341 --> 40:10.376
Gulley, remember,

40:10.443 --> 40:12.878
just because a thing is new

40:12.946 --> 40:14.446
it doesn't
make it good.

40:14.514 --> 40:15.848
Okay.

40:15.915 --> 40:18.951
It makes my skin crawl to hear
that stupid, damn singing.

40:19.019 --> 40:20.786
I know.

40:20.854 --> 40:24.189
So let's all go together
to Cavanaugh on Sunday.

40:24.257 --> 40:25.891
DAVID:
Okay.

40:25.959 --> 40:28.727
When the three of you
go on your own,

40:28.795 --> 40:32.164
Gulley, do you go by yourself
to get Communion?

40:32.232 --> 40:33.532
Of course.

40:33.600 --> 40:35.634
I'm asking Gulley.

40:35.702 --> 40:37.403
Sure. It's not that hard.

40:38.505 --> 40:40.239
But it's important.

40:40.306 --> 40:43.075
I know.

40:43.143 --> 40:44.777
She's just never
going to let it go.

40:44.844 --> 40:46.111
Snooping? Jesus.

40:46.179 --> 40:48.547
She has, it's just her way.

40:48.615 --> 40:49.782
Well, it ridiculous.

40:49.849 --> 40:51.216
You left the seminary
12 years ago.

40:51.284 --> 40:52.651
Give it a fucking rest.

40:52.719 --> 40:54.153
It's not that, Ellen.

40:54.220 --> 40:56.121
If there's one thing that
woman adores, it's Gulley,

40:56.189 --> 40:57.756
and he wouldn't even
exist if you...

40:57.824 --> 40:58.957
That's not what it is.

40:59.025 --> 41:00.359
Then what, the divorce?
Yes.

41:00.427 --> 41:01.927
It's not a big deal.

41:01.995 --> 41:04.563
It is to her
and to everybody in there.

41:04.631 --> 41:06.331
It's a big deal.

41:06.399 --> 41:08.000
Every time she takes Gulley
for Communion,

41:08.068 --> 41:10.069
and I just stay there
in the pew...

41:10.136 --> 41:13.339
(wry laugh)
it is a big deal, Ellen.

41:13.406 --> 41:14.973
I'm standing there with you.

41:15.041 --> 41:16.809
No, it's different.

41:16.876 --> 41:20.579
And don't say
he's the only thing she adores.

41:20.647 --> 41:24.316
Really, who's next on the list,
her housecleaner?

41:25.418 --> 41:27.353
(water running)

41:36.763 --> 41:38.263
(paper rustling)

41:39.366 --> 41:42.101
Who are you writing letters to?

41:42.168 --> 41:44.136
What?

41:44.204 --> 41:45.771
I saw a letter
on your desk before.

41:45.839 --> 41:47.339
Who are you writing letters to?

41:47.407 --> 41:49.274
It's not a letter.

41:49.342 --> 41:50.876
Don't lie to me.

41:50.944 --> 41:53.412
So who the hell are you writing
our business to?

41:53.480 --> 41:54.780
"Grandma's coming
for dinner tonight."

41:54.848 --> 41:56.849
Uh, "I'm trying to keep
the soap clean."

41:56.916 --> 41:58.150
I mean, what the hell is that?

41:58.218 --> 41:59.852
I said it's not a letter.

41:59.919 --> 42:01.387
Gulley...
- It's not.

42:01.454 --> 42:03.889
Then what is it?

42:03.957 --> 42:05.958
A diary.

42:07.060 --> 42:09.228
A diary?

42:09.295 --> 42:10.362
Yeah.

42:10.430 --> 42:11.930
(laughs)

42:11.998 --> 42:13.298
Jesus.

42:13.366 --> 42:16.869
What are you,
a nine-year-old girl?

42:43.263 --> 42:45.464
(pool balls clacking)

42:45.532 --> 42:47.333
Hello, Gulley.

42:47.400 --> 42:48.434
How's school?

42:48.501 --> 42:49.535
It's good.

42:49.602 --> 42:51.704
Here you go.
- Great. Thanks.

43:02.115 --> 43:04.550
(door creaking)

43:06.753 --> 43:10.189
Well, holy shit,
where have you been?

43:10.256 --> 43:12.157
I got stuck
in the city for a bit.

43:12.225 --> 43:13.525
How was it?

43:13.593 --> 43:14.893
It was good.

43:14.961 --> 43:16.829
How have things been here?

43:16.896 --> 43:18.597
Same ol'.

43:18.665 --> 43:20.165
Game tonight?

43:20.233 --> 43:21.300
Sure.

43:21.368 --> 43:24.370
Probably go easier
on Randolph though.

43:24.437 --> 43:25.738
He still pissed?

43:25.805 --> 43:28.340
Just doesn't like
getting rivered is all.

43:28.408 --> 43:29.775
No one does.

43:29.843 --> 43:31.810
You want a beer?

43:31.878 --> 43:32.978
Uh, yeah.

43:33.046 --> 43:34.813
Yeah, and maybe a whiskey.

43:34.881 --> 43:36.749
You sure you want to
be double-fisting?

43:36.816 --> 43:38.217
You've looked
better, you know.

43:38.284 --> 43:39.718
Yeah, I hear that.

43:40.820 --> 43:42.721
Hi, Abby. It's Ellen.

43:42.789 --> 43:45.024
Um, you probably aren't
back from mass yet,

43:45.091 --> 43:46.692
but we couldn't make it.

43:46.760 --> 43:48.994
Um, Gulley had
a fever this morning,

43:49.062 --> 43:50.662
so I just put him
back in bed.

43:50.730 --> 43:53.766
But, uh, we'll try and swing by
later this afternoon.

43:53.833 --> 43:56.835
Okay? See you soon.

44:06.279 --> 44:08.247
(door closes)

44:08.314 --> 44:09.882
Are you feeling
better?

44:09.949 --> 44:11.216
I am, yeah.

44:11.284 --> 44:13.152
What was it
you think?

44:13.219 --> 44:16.021
Just a kid thing.

44:16.089 --> 44:17.956
So, not the escarole.

44:18.024 --> 44:19.658
No, I don't think so.

44:19.726 --> 44:20.693
Well,

44:20.760 --> 44:22.695
you missed Father Cavanaugh.

44:22.762 --> 44:24.697
He was good,

44:24.764 --> 44:26.932
but it was Sunday

44:27.000 --> 44:30.269
so he was playing
to the Sunday only.

44:30.337 --> 44:34.306
Lots of Galilee
and "fisher of men."

44:34.374 --> 44:38.510
Do you know why Christ
is a fisher of men, Gulley?

44:38.578 --> 44:42.181
'Cause he likes
catching people.

44:42.248 --> 44:43.816
Are you being wise?

44:43.883 --> 44:45.784
No.

44:45.852 --> 44:47.619
I might be wrong
about that school.

44:47.687 --> 44:49.955
David!

44:50.023 --> 44:51.357
You have a nosebleed.

44:51.424 --> 44:52.858
He's been getting
these sometimes.

44:52.926 --> 44:54.026
Here, hon.

44:55.428 --> 44:57.396
Thanks.

44:57.464 --> 44:59.732
Have you been to a doctor
for God's sake?

44:59.799 --> 45:01.734
It's just a bloody nose, Mom.

45:01.801 --> 45:03.469
I'm fine.

45:23.690 --> 45:25.624
(sighs)

45:26.960 --> 45:28.894
That was even less than a week.
- I know.

45:28.962 --> 45:30.729
That's better right?
Come on.

45:30.797 --> 45:32.231
Got to get
our picture take.

45:32.298 --> 45:34.099
Why?
- 'Cause the only one I have of you

45:34.167 --> 45:35.768
you're like two day old
or something.

45:35.835 --> 45:36.869
Okay.

45:36.936 --> 45:39.338
Oh, uh, I wrote down
what I do everyday.

45:39.406 --> 45:41.340
It's pretty
boring.

45:41.408 --> 45:43.342
Thanks, Gulls.
- Sure.

45:43.410 --> 45:45.611
See your grandma
yesterday?

45:45.679 --> 45:47.179
Yeah.
How was that?

45:47.247 --> 45:49.214
Okay. It gave me a headache.
- Yeah?

45:49.282 --> 45:51.717
Yeah and dad got
a bloody nose.

45:51.785 --> 45:53.752
How?
- I don't know, it just happened.

45:53.820 --> 45:56.088
You sure your grandma
didn't punch him?

45:56.156 --> 45:58.824
(chuckles)

45:58.892 --> 46:00.993
Do I look like that?

46:01.061 --> 46:03.328
Still look
like a lawyer.

46:03.396 --> 46:05.998
Hey, how's
the Paul Revere guy?

46:06.066 --> 46:08.000
It's done.
- You finished it?

46:08.068 --> 46:10.169
No, but we had the test
already.

46:10.236 --> 46:12.104
How'd it go?
- I don't know yet.

46:12.172 --> 46:14.173
I got Eric Mufti
to tell me how it ended,

46:14.240 --> 46:15.774
so that helped.

46:15.842 --> 46:18.310
Well, I can tell this
Mufti guy ain't much of a genius.

46:18.378 --> 46:20.446
Yeah, but he's okay.

46:20.513 --> 46:22.448
Yeah?
- Yeah.

46:24.517 --> 46:27.119
I have to ask you
a question.

46:27.187 --> 46:29.121
Okay.

46:29.189 --> 46:31.290
It's not really
a fair question.

46:31.358 --> 46:32.958
What do you mean?

46:33.026 --> 46:35.394
Uh, I think you're too
young to ask it to.

46:35.462 --> 46:38.397
That's okay.

46:38.465 --> 46:41.400
How would you like
to come live with me for a bit?

46:45.605 --> 46:47.873
Uh, it'd be very
different, you know.

46:47.941 --> 46:49.375
Lots a, a lot
of changes.

46:49.442 --> 46:51.210
Yeah.
- I mean different school, different city,

46:51.277 --> 46:53.345
all of that.
- I know.

46:53.413 --> 46:55.514
What about missing Eric?

46:55.582 --> 46:58.517
I wouldn't miss him
that much.

46:59.886 --> 47:01.820
What about missing
your dad?

47:06.793 --> 47:08.727
Dad found the letter.

47:08.795 --> 47:09.895
Oh.

47:09.963 --> 47:12.064
But he didn't know
it was to you.

47:12.132 --> 47:14.066
Oh, well, that's
okay then.

47:14.134 --> 47:16.735
Yeah, but still,
he was mad about it

47:16.803 --> 47:19.738
and this is going
to make him really, really mad.

47:19.806 --> 47:21.573
Yeah.

47:21.641 --> 47:22.741
No, I know it will.

47:22.809 --> 47:24.176
And it will make
Abby mad, too,

47:24.244 --> 47:25.344
but you know what?

47:25.412 --> 47:26.812
You won't be around
to see it

47:26.880 --> 47:28.914
so you don't have to
worry about it, okay?

47:28.982 --> 47:30.949
Okay.

47:31.017 --> 47:33.986
Okay-Okay you want
to do it?

47:34.054 --> 47:36.155
Uh-huh.

47:36.222 --> 47:37.856
You gotta make sure

47:37.924 --> 47:39.491
you see Mr. Quinette
every single day, okay.

47:39.559 --> 47:40.826
'Cause we can't
see each other.

47:40.894 --> 47:42.828
Yeah.

47:44.497 --> 47:46.432
And listen...

47:46.499 --> 47:49.435
if we do this,
where we're going,

47:49.502 --> 47:52.871
there might not be any
cotillions or any of that fancy stuff.

47:52.939 --> 47:54.873
Is that going
to be okay?

47:54.941 --> 47:56.875
Yeah.
- Okay.

47:56.943 --> 47:59.478
Try and keep your
nose clean, okay.

48:07.620 --> 48:10.155
(door squeaking)

48:10.223 --> 48:12.157
How was the trip?
- Good.

48:12.225 --> 48:14.159
Coffee?
- Yeah, please.

48:14.227 --> 48:15.828
Got any money left?

48:15.895 --> 48:17.996
I made a couple hundred
in a card game.

48:18.064 --> 48:19.665
Okay!

48:19.733 --> 48:22.668
Come on, I got somebody
I want you to meet.

48:22.736 --> 48:25.037
(sighs)

48:25.105 --> 48:26.271
This is Ralph.

48:26.339 --> 48:27.439
Uh...

48:27.507 --> 48:28.607
hey, Ralph.

48:28.675 --> 48:30.909
I want you

48:30.977 --> 48:32.911
to play him.

48:32.979 --> 48:35.080
Okay, uh, what do you
want to play, Ralph?

48:37.183 --> 48:39.785
One pocket.

48:39.853 --> 48:41.787
$100 a rack.

48:45.692 --> 48:48.627
(door shuts)

49:16.823 --> 49:18.757
# #

49:48.755 --> 49:50.689
How you doing?

49:50.757 --> 49:52.191
Good. I'm up.

49:52.258 --> 49:54.193
How much?
$600.

49:54.260 --> 49:56.195
Out of how many racks?

49:57.697 --> 49:59.665
14.

49:59.733 --> 50:01.033
I got to say the
kid's good,

50:01.101 --> 50:02.634
but I'm shooting the
lights out of him.

50:04.738 --> 50:06.839
It was nice meeting
you, ma'am.

50:06.906 --> 50:09.341
You're a good shot.

50:09.409 --> 50:11.343
What the fuck was that?

50:11.411 --> 50:13.379
That was an audition.

50:13.446 --> 50:15.381
For him or me?

50:15.448 --> 50:16.815
For him.

50:16.883 --> 50:18.550
Remember Billy Victor?

50:18.618 --> 50:20.552
California guy.

50:20.620 --> 50:22.721
That's his kid,
Ralphie.

50:22.789 --> 50:26.125
I gave him a grand.

50:26.192 --> 50:28.127
Out of the two
that I offered you.

50:28.194 --> 50:29.361
I told him,

50:29.429 --> 50:33.198
"You lose $600 exactly.

50:33.266 --> 50:35.200
"Don't tip your hand

50:35.268 --> 50:37.336
"and get your best game,

50:37.404 --> 50:40.506
you can keep the $400."

50:40.573 --> 50:42.608
That kid was laying down?

50:44.411 --> 50:45.544
Bullshit!

50:45.612 --> 50:47.112
There's no way that
kid could beat me.

50:47.180 --> 50:48.480
Oh, I don't know
whether he can

50:48.548 --> 50:52.184
or he can't, but I do know
that he can lose to you.

50:52.252 --> 50:55.187
And that's better
for us.

50:55.255 --> 50:57.523
Why?
-'Cause you're not going to get this game

50:57.590 --> 51:00.359
for 60 K all by yourself.

51:00.427 --> 51:02.361
You need a stalking horse

51:02.429 --> 51:05.497
and I believe we got him.

51:05.565 --> 51:07.966
Jesus Christ, Quinn, could you
at least give me a head's up

51:08.034 --> 51:09.635
when you're doing
shit like this?

51:09.703 --> 51:10.969
Why?

51:11.037 --> 51:13.439
If he can take
a fall to you,

51:13.506 --> 51:15.007
he can convince
anybody.

51:15.075 --> 51:17.009
So give me
my $600 back.

51:18.611 --> 51:20.579
Oh, listen to me,

51:20.647 --> 51:23.582
there's no way he could
take you straight up.

51:23.650 --> 51:27.186
Controlled losing
is not winning.

51:29.289 --> 51:31.957
Hey, see that guy
over there.

51:32.025 --> 51:33.125
Is that guy lurking around
for you?

51:33.193 --> 51:34.526
Yeah.

51:34.594 --> 51:36.161
He's clearly not here
for the pool.

51:36.229 --> 51:37.196
He's just

51:37.263 --> 51:38.797
drawing attention
to himself.

51:38.865 --> 51:40.666
Would you get him
the hell out of here?

51:40.734 --> 51:42.668
Yeah.

51:45.605 --> 51:48.774
This is a ridiculous game.

51:48.842 --> 51:50.843
'Cause you suck at it.
- Yeah, I do, I know.

51:50.910 --> 51:52.711
But I mean, it doesn't
even have the appeal

51:52.779 --> 51:54.179
to try to get
better for it.

51:54.247 --> 51:56.448
I mean, it's just,
it's irritating.

51:56.516 --> 51:58.117
That's 'cause
you suck at it.

51:58.184 --> 52:00.119
Come on.

52:03.256 --> 52:05.224
<i>Don't get too excited.</i>

52:05.291 --> 52:06.759
It's just the photos.

52:06.826 --> 52:07.926
Okay.

52:07.994 --> 52:09.261
I'll have
the money soon.

52:09.329 --> 52:10.596
I'm not worried,
uh, you know.

52:10.663 --> 52:12.231
They'll be ready in
a couple of days.

52:12.298 --> 52:14.233
Come here.

52:15.835 --> 52:17.670
What?
- Look, I need you to do something,

52:17.737 --> 52:19.672
besides get me
my money.

52:19.739 --> 52:22.841
I want you to figure out
where you're going to cross.

52:22.909 --> 52:24.076
What do you mean?

52:24.144 --> 52:25.944
Well, these are going
to be good.

52:26.012 --> 52:28.213
They're going to be as good
as anything you've ever seen.

52:28.281 --> 52:30.616
But, since you've got a kid,

52:30.684 --> 52:32.284
you try to go through
a major airport,

52:32.352 --> 52:34.119
like, uh, Toronto
or Vancouver,

52:34.187 --> 52:35.354
you're just asking

52:35.422 --> 52:37.256
for trouble.
- We're driving.

52:37.323 --> 52:38.924
Yeah, but still, um...

52:38.992 --> 52:41.927
like Niagara Falls,
still stupid.

52:41.995 --> 52:43.929
Okay.
- Okay.

52:43.997 --> 52:45.831
Uh, you taking your own car?

52:45.899 --> 52:47.833
No, no, I won it
in a card game.

52:47.901 --> 52:49.401
But the guy keeps
holding the paper

52:49.469 --> 52:50.803
thinking he can
get it back.

52:50.870 --> 52:52.438
That's a dumb guy.

52:52.505 --> 52:53.472
Hey, uh...

52:53.540 --> 52:54.873
Markus...

52:54.941 --> 52:56.975
What? What?
- I need one more thing.

52:57.043 --> 52:58.277
A gun.

52:58.345 --> 53:01.113
Look,

53:01.181 --> 53:04.717
that's not the kind of thing you
say in just like a talky voice.

53:04.784 --> 53:06.318
Doesn't have to work.

53:06.386 --> 53:07.820
In fact, I don't
even need bullets.

53:07.887 --> 53:09.254
But it should look good.
- No.

53:09.322 --> 53:11.457
There's reason in the world
you need a pretend gun.

53:11.524 --> 53:13.492
You either need a real one
or you don't.

53:13.560 --> 53:16.428
No, I need a real looking
pretend one.

53:46.559 --> 53:48.494
# #

54:01.875 --> 54:03.809
Hey, Quinn!

54:04.878 --> 54:07.146
Quinn, get up!

54:07.213 --> 54:09.982
I got breakfast.

54:10.050 --> 54:11.817
Quinn!

54:11.885 --> 54:14.153
...I don't eat
breakfast!

54:14.220 --> 54:16.155
Go away!

54:16.222 --> 54:17.823
Oh, for God's sakes.

54:17.891 --> 54:20.159
You have to... oh.
Kailey, don't!

54:20.226 --> 54:22.461
Oh...
- Sorry.

54:36.843 --> 54:38.510
Uh...

54:38.578 --> 54:39.578
sorry again.

54:39.646 --> 54:40.746
You're making
my retirement

54:40.814 --> 54:43.582
difficult in many, many ways.

54:43.650 --> 54:44.616
It just...

54:44.684 --> 54:46.218
What?

54:48.321 --> 54:51.256
I don't know, it just...

54:51.324 --> 54:53.425
sorry.

54:53.493 --> 54:56.428
Why the early morning
enthusiasm?

54:56.496 --> 54:58.464
Here.

54:58.531 --> 55:00.532
What's this?

55:00.600 --> 55:02.901
Just some things to remember
when people come asking.

55:02.969 --> 55:04.136
People?

55:04.204 --> 55:05.604
Police people?

55:05.672 --> 55:07.272
Probably.

55:07.340 --> 55:09.274
Okay.

55:11.778 --> 55:15.414
"She slept on top of
the table for a few days,

55:15.482 --> 55:17.483
"and then
was gone.

55:17.550 --> 55:20.319
She played
lots of pool."

55:20.387 --> 55:23.489
You could have slipped this
under the door.

55:23.556 --> 55:24.757
I already said I'm sorry.

55:24.824 --> 55:26.959
Okay.

55:28.061 --> 55:31.163
I need to set up the game soon.

55:31.231 --> 55:33.799
Well, all we
can do is try.

55:33.867 --> 55:35.934
(subway clattering)

55:40.840 --> 55:43.842
Duncan plays this...
this guy Mike Simms every week,

55:43.910 --> 55:46.879
and he beats him every week,
without fail.

55:46.946 --> 55:48.280
First step,

55:48.348 --> 55:51.784
we got to get rid of
this degenerate Simms,

55:51.851 --> 55:53.686
and get
Duncan to play

55:53.753 --> 55:55.187
Ralphie Victor, and if

55:55.255 --> 55:57.790
Ralphie does his job
the way we know he can,

55:57.857 --> 56:00.159
Duncan should have a
good taste in his mouth

56:00.226 --> 56:02.127
when you come around.

56:02.195 --> 56:04.697
Okay. I'll get Markus
to distract Simms for us.

56:04.764 --> 56:06.265
Yeah, but you got

56:06.332 --> 56:08.000
to keep your eye
on me, because...

56:08.068 --> 56:10.135
if you don't play
him just right,

56:10.203 --> 56:12.871
he'll slip the hook.

56:12.939 --> 56:14.940
Okay. There's more
on the back. The letter.

56:15.008 --> 56:16.108
On-On the back.

56:25.051 --> 56:27.720
(laughs)

56:27.787 --> 56:29.488
"Don't lie for me.

56:29.556 --> 56:31.857
At all."

56:31.925 --> 56:33.859
You got it.

56:35.895 --> 56:37.796
It's not a sex thing.
- Yes, it is.

56:37.864 --> 56:39.198
It's not. I asked.

56:39.265 --> 56:41.033
It is. Your mother
wanted an abortion.

56:41.101 --> 56:42.234
It's not that.

56:42.302 --> 56:43.836
It's like an annuls.

56:43.903 --> 56:45.904
It's the same thing.
It's not.

56:45.972 --> 56:48.007
It's like a divorce,
but for the church.

56:48.074 --> 56:49.308
A divorce from God?

56:49.376 --> 56:50.743
I guess.
- That's even worse then.

56:50.810 --> 56:52.644
Shut up, and she
didn't even get it.

56:52.712 --> 56:53.479
But she wanted to.
- Shut up!

56:53.546 --> 56:55.714
(subway cars clattering)

57:08.395 --> 57:10.329
(pool balls clacking)

57:39.859 --> 57:43.062
# #

57:53.139 --> 57:55.374
Nice games.

57:55.442 --> 57:57.376
No more?

57:57.444 --> 57:59.378
No.

58:04.451 --> 58:05.551
You want to play again?

58:06.653 --> 58:08.654
Come on.

58:08.722 --> 58:09.755
I'll give you the ball

58:09.823 --> 58:11.223
I offered you before.

58:11.291 --> 58:12.624
No.

58:12.692 --> 58:14.126
I'll give you two balls.

58:14.194 --> 58:16.295
What were we
playing before?

58:16.363 --> 58:17.796
A hundred a rack.

58:17.864 --> 58:19.932
Okay.

58:20.000 --> 58:21.934
Why don't we do five a rack,

58:22.002 --> 58:23.936
and I'll still take the weight.

58:25.038 --> 58:27.306
Okay.

58:27.374 --> 58:30.175
But I'm not going
to give you the first break.

58:30.243 --> 58:32.611
So we'll lag.

58:42.689 --> 58:44.623
Nice.

59:13.420 --> 59:15.354
# #

59:45.218 --> 59:47.319
# #

01:00:17.083 --> 01:00:19.218
# #

01:00:25.759 --> 01:00:27.693
We got to play
straight up.

01:00:27.761 --> 01:00:29.194
No more giving you weight.

01:00:29.262 --> 01:00:31.764
Okay. Let's go a
thousand a rack.

01:00:31.831 --> 01:00:33.766
Sure.

01:00:33.833 --> 01:00:35.601
This can't be
a cash game anymore.

01:00:38.538 --> 01:00:40.472
Hey,

01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:43.208
go down and lock the door.

01:00:43.276 --> 01:00:46.311
(door squeaking)

01:00:57.691 --> 01:00:59.658
I thought you might like this.

01:00:59.726 --> 01:01:01.126
What is it?

01:01:01.194 --> 01:01:04.263
It's a book of poems
by Sherwood Anderson.

01:01:04.330 --> 01:01:07.199
He was a poet, but he worked
in advertising first.

01:01:07.267 --> 01:01:08.934
Oh.

01:01:09.002 --> 01:01:12.371
I just... I thought
you might like it.

01:01:42.502 --> 01:01:45.104
# #

01:02:11.731 --> 01:02:13.666
(pool balls clacking)

01:02:15.135 --> 01:02:17.069
(pool balls clacking)

01:02:31.885 --> 01:02:34.353
That it?

01:02:34.421 --> 01:02:37.156
How much am I down?

01:02:37.223 --> 01:02:38.590
How much am I down?

01:02:38.658 --> 01:02:40.059
7500.

01:02:40.126 --> 01:02:42.728
That's a lot.

01:02:44.497 --> 01:02:47.466
You should quit.

01:02:53.239 --> 01:02:56.208
I'll play you
for $10,000 a rack,

01:02:56.276 --> 01:02:58.444
but I need a break first.

01:02:58.511 --> 01:03:00.546
I'll be back in an hour or so.

01:03:00.613 --> 01:03:02.548
You be here?

01:03:02.615 --> 01:03:04.383
I'll be here.

01:03:04.451 --> 01:03:07.152
It's back to being a cash game
from now on.

01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:08.921
Okay.

01:03:12.759 --> 01:03:14.693
Okay.

01:03:16.796 --> 01:03:18.330
Here. Give him
one of these.

01:03:18.398 --> 01:03:19.498
No, no.

01:03:19.566 --> 01:03:21.333
Come on, eat it.
You'll need it.

01:03:21.401 --> 01:03:23.435
And try to get a
rest, will you?

01:03:23.503 --> 01:03:24.770
Just stretch
out right here.

01:03:24.838 --> 01:03:26.071
What about you?

01:03:26.139 --> 01:03:27.506
Well, I'm fine.

01:03:27.574 --> 01:03:30.376
I chewed most the enamel
off my teeth, but I'm fine.

01:03:30.443 --> 01:03:31.710
What have you
got there?

01:03:31.778 --> 01:03:33.112
11, five.

01:03:33.179 --> 01:03:37.249
Okay. Plus,
that's seven, five he owes.

01:03:37.317 --> 01:03:39.251
This is, uh...

01:03:41.588 --> 01:03:44.923
...25, 600 something.

01:03:44.991 --> 01:03:48.060
Shit.

01:03:48.128 --> 01:03:49.928
Lose two in a row,
we're through.

01:03:49.996 --> 01:03:51.263
What if he doesn't come back?

01:03:51.331 --> 01:03:52.564
Oh, he's coming back.

01:03:52.632 --> 01:03:54.500
How do you know?
- Because he wants

01:03:54.567 --> 01:03:56.468
to beat your brains in,
that's why.

01:03:56.536 --> 01:03:58.771
It's almost 5:00
in the morning.

01:03:58.838 --> 01:04:01.840
Now, listen, you
don't need to win

01:04:01.908 --> 01:04:03.208
six games.

01:04:03.276 --> 01:04:05.444
Win four.

01:04:05.512 --> 01:04:09.148
I'll make the
rest up in bets.

01:04:09.215 --> 01:04:10.282
And don't be surprised

01:04:10.350 --> 01:04:12.484
if he don't try
to fuck with you.

01:04:12.552 --> 01:04:15.087
Like how?
- I don't know,

01:04:15.155 --> 01:04:19.792
but he'll do something to try
to knock you off your rhythm.

01:04:35.909 --> 01:04:38.143
(door squeaking)

01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:41.180
Ten grand a rack.

01:04:41.247 --> 01:04:42.348
Yup.

01:04:42.415 --> 01:04:43.515
Cash.

01:04:43.583 --> 01:04:44.650
Quinn's got mine.

01:04:44.718 --> 01:04:45.984
And Quinn's
friend has mine.

01:04:46.052 --> 01:04:47.219
(door squealing)

01:04:50.056 --> 01:04:51.990
Your dad would be sick.

01:04:54.561 --> 01:04:55.961
And we're playing
nine ball.

01:04:56.029 --> 01:04:57.496
Raise to seven.

01:04:57.564 --> 01:04:59.765
What happened to one pocket?

01:04:59.833 --> 01:05:02.568
It went away. Problem?

01:05:06.373 --> 01:05:09.141
No problem.

01:05:10.777 --> 01:05:12.711
(laughs)

01:05:12.779 --> 01:05:14.480
What?

01:05:15.582 --> 01:05:17.716
Just seems a chumpy game for us.

01:05:21.654 --> 01:05:23.589
You want to quit me?

01:05:26.393 --> 01:05:28.327
No, I'll play you.

01:05:29.763 --> 01:05:31.697
Just think
it's beneath us is all.

01:05:34.734 --> 01:05:38.003
Well... I'll learn
to live with it.

01:05:39.105 --> 01:05:41.040
Lag for the break.

01:06:06.633 --> 01:06:09.201
Nobody's going
to bet on this.

01:06:09.269 --> 01:06:10.836
This is his game.

01:06:10.904 --> 01:06:12.871
You'll be lucky
to sink even one nine ball.

01:06:12.939 --> 01:06:14.506
Fuck off, will you?

01:06:44.137 --> 01:06:47.740
# #

01:07:16.569 --> 01:07:20.305
# #

01:07:48.702 --> 01:07:51.637
(buzzing)

01:08:21.234 --> 01:08:23.736
# #

01:08:26.473 --> 01:08:29.073
I need a minute.

01:08:29.142 --> 01:08:30.408
No way.

01:08:30.477 --> 01:08:31.743
I need a minute.
- No!

01:08:31.810 --> 01:08:33.045
Then it's a forfeit.

01:08:33.113 --> 01:08:34.046
The hell you say!

01:08:34.113 --> 01:08:35.346
You took a three-hour break
earlier!

01:08:35.415 --> 01:08:38.050
That wasn't in the middle
of a fucking game.

01:08:38.118 --> 01:08:40.853
She can take a
break at the end.

01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:42.554
She wants a break now,
it's a forfeit.

01:08:42.622 --> 01:08:44.223
All right.

01:08:44.290 --> 01:08:45.224
You guys, move.

01:08:45.291 --> 01:08:48.027
You okay?

01:08:48.094 --> 01:08:49.028
Yeah.

01:08:49.095 --> 01:08:50.828
You sure?
- Yeah.

01:08:52.332 --> 01:08:55.200
Okay.

01:08:58.270 --> 01:09:00.906
And this isn't the middle
of the fucking game.

01:09:18.957 --> 01:09:20.893
(applause, cheering,
and whistling)

01:09:36.910 --> 01:09:38.042
Who did that?

01:09:38.111 --> 01:09:39.144
It's okay.

01:09:39.212 --> 01:09:40.145
Your dad do that?

01:09:40.212 --> 01:09:42.180
No, just a kid at school.

01:09:42.247 --> 01:09:43.816
That Muftie kid?

01:09:43.883 --> 01:09:44.850
Yeah.

01:09:44.917 --> 01:09:47.086
I told you that
kid was bad news.

01:09:47.153 --> 01:09:49.087
Yeah, but you were great.

01:09:49.154 --> 01:09:50.322
Yeah?

01:09:51.424 --> 01:09:54.693
Well... it worked out.

01:09:54.761 --> 01:09:55.928
All right, get out of here.

01:09:55.995 --> 01:09:57.763
Okay?

01:09:57.831 --> 01:09:58.997
Hey, uh, Gulls.

01:09:59.065 --> 01:10:02.201
Uh, tomorrow, when
you leave for school,

01:10:02.268 --> 01:10:04.503
uh, pack some extra clothes
in your backpack, okay?

01:10:04.571 --> 01:10:08.173
And find some excuse to get
what's-her-face to walk you

01:10:08.241 --> 01:10:10.776
and leave the apartment
door unlocked.

01:10:10.844 --> 01:10:11.777
Okay.

01:10:11.845 --> 01:10:13.912
Oh, and meet me here.

01:10:23.356 --> 01:10:25.991
(door opens)

01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:29.361
(door closes)

01:10:32.699 --> 01:10:35.501
That should do you and give
you a little something extra.

01:10:35.568 --> 01:10:38.203
You reimburse yourself
a thousand?

01:10:38.271 --> 01:10:40.139
It was $400.

01:10:40.206 --> 01:10:42.808
You're going to need
all you can get.

01:10:45.612 --> 01:10:46.679
You should take it.

01:10:46.746 --> 01:10:49.381
Nah.

01:11:13.306 --> 01:11:15.240
Hey.

01:11:15.308 --> 01:11:17.843
(slurps)

01:11:17.911 --> 01:11:19.144
What are you doing?

01:11:19.212 --> 01:11:20.879
I just want
the broth.

01:11:20.947 --> 01:11:22.147
Okay.

01:11:22.215 --> 01:11:24.483
It's all in here.

01:11:24.551 --> 01:11:26.685
Thanks.

01:11:26.753 --> 01:11:28.554
There you go.

01:11:28.621 --> 01:11:29.555
All right, look.

01:11:29.622 --> 01:11:31.457
I took you at your word.

01:11:31.524 --> 01:11:34.126
It's a fake gun,
but it looks real,

01:11:34.194 --> 01:11:36.462
and if you put bullets
in it,

01:11:36.529 --> 01:11:39.498
it's going to blow up
in your face.

01:11:39.566 --> 01:11:40.666
Thanks.

01:11:40.734 --> 01:11:42.534
And do me a favor, will you?
What's that?

01:11:42.602 --> 01:11:46.138
When you get there,
just, uh, you know,

01:11:46.206 --> 01:11:49.575
send me a postcard
of a pool table or something

01:11:49.642 --> 01:11:51.577
just to tell me
that you made it safe.

01:11:51.644 --> 01:11:52.578
(chuckles)

01:11:52.645 --> 01:11:54.013
Thanks, Markus.

01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:56.015
(sighs)

01:11:59.519 --> 01:12:01.453
Okay.

01:12:01.521 --> 01:12:02.454
Take care.

01:12:02.522 --> 01:12:04.990
(door sticks)

01:12:05.058 --> 01:12:07.893
It's locked, it's locked.

01:12:15.201 --> 01:12:18.037
(whispering):
David.

01:12:18.104 --> 01:12:20.906
David?

01:12:20.974 --> 01:12:22.641
David.

01:12:22.709 --> 01:12:23.909
(loudly):
David.

01:12:23.977 --> 01:12:27.146
(sighs)

01:12:27.213 --> 01:12:30.082
Kai?

01:12:30.150 --> 01:12:32.518
(grunts)

01:12:32.585 --> 01:12:33.619
What are you doing here?

01:12:33.687 --> 01:12:36.789
I was in town,
thought I'd say hi.

01:12:36.856 --> 01:12:38.691
How'd you get in?

01:12:38.758 --> 01:12:40.125
Door was open.

01:12:40.193 --> 01:12:41.760
You have to buzz.

01:12:41.828 --> 01:12:43.762
Just followed
somebody in.

01:12:43.830 --> 01:12:44.897
Where's Gulley?

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.868
He's at school.

01:12:49.936 --> 01:12:51.837
(sighs)

01:12:51.905 --> 01:12:52.905
(chuckling):
Jesus.

01:12:55.675 --> 01:12:57.676
What are you doing here, Rings?

01:13:00.814 --> 01:13:02.748
Don't call me that.

01:13:02.816 --> 01:13:05.150
Sorry.

01:13:05.218 --> 01:13:07.886
So what are
you doing here?

01:13:07.954 --> 01:13:09.321
Told you,
I was just in town.

01:13:09.389 --> 01:13:10.389
Here,
brought you a coffee.

01:13:10.457 --> 01:13:11.390
You what?

01:13:11.458 --> 01:13:12.991
A coffee.

01:13:13.059 --> 01:13:14.259
(grunts)

01:13:17.497 --> 01:13:19.531
(chuckling):
Look at you.

01:13:19.599 --> 01:13:20.666
All grown up.

01:13:23.970 --> 01:13:25.904
You want to know
what I've been up to?

01:13:25.972 --> 01:13:28.907
What, like, the last, I don't
know, 11 years have been like?

01:13:28.975 --> 01:13:29.908
No.

01:13:29.976 --> 01:13:32.211
Yeah, you do.

01:13:32.278 --> 01:13:36.582
How's Abby?

01:13:36.649 --> 01:13:39.451
Well, give her my best.

01:13:42.489 --> 01:13:45.090
He's been writing
to you, hasn't he?

01:13:45.158 --> 01:13:46.959
Those letters
were, were to you?

01:13:48.628 --> 01:13:49.561
That lying brat.

01:13:49.629 --> 01:13:50.996
David,
do me a favor.

01:13:51.064 --> 01:13:53.732
C-Can we just,
just sit here for a sec?

01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:55.801
Please.

01:13:55.869 --> 01:13:56.802
(sighs)

01:13:58.371 --> 01:14:00.139
He wrote me
about a lot of stuff.

01:14:00.206 --> 01:14:01.407
Yeah?

01:14:01.474 --> 01:14:02.408
Like what?

01:14:02.475 --> 01:14:04.209
Well... for one,

01:14:04.277 --> 01:14:07.046
you're making him take dancing
lessons, for God's sakes.

01:14:07.113 --> 01:14:08.447
Give me a break.

01:14:08.515 --> 01:14:10.516
And how he has to lie
about going to church

01:14:10.583 --> 01:14:12.384
and how he gets
into fights.

01:14:12.452 --> 01:14:13.652
Every kid gets
into fights.

01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:14.753
Yeah.

01:14:14.821 --> 01:14:17.756
Not every kid has
to lie for his dad.

01:14:19.659 --> 01:14:21.760
How'd he break his hand?

01:14:21.828 --> 01:14:23.729
He fell down.
- How?

01:14:23.797 --> 01:14:26.265
Kids fall down-- enough
with the fucking grilling.

01:14:26.332 --> 01:14:27.266
Seriously,
David,

01:14:27.334 --> 01:14:28.867
I need you to stay in bed.

01:14:28.935 --> 01:14:30.302
Shut up, Rings, okay?

01:14:30.370 --> 01:14:31.537
Where the fuck is my watch?

01:14:31.604 --> 01:14:32.538
David.

01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:36.008
I need you to stay in bed

01:14:36.076 --> 01:14:40.846
and don't call me Rings
even one more goddamn time!

01:14:40.914 --> 01:14:41.914
(quietly):
Lay back down.

01:14:41.981 --> 01:14:45.384
Lay back down.

01:14:45.452 --> 01:14:46.385
(exhales)

01:14:46.453 --> 01:14:47.453
What are you doing?

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:49.788
I'm taking him with me.

01:14:49.856 --> 01:14:50.789
Well, he's
not here.

01:14:50.857 --> 01:14:51.790
I know.

01:14:51.858 --> 01:14:53.125
Oh, Jesus.

01:14:53.193 --> 01:14:56.562
Now, tell me,
how did he fall down?

01:14:58.665 --> 01:15:01.200
We just bumped
into each other.

01:15:03.269 --> 01:15:07.306
(sighs)

01:15:07.374 --> 01:15:09.842
Like I said... he wrote me
about a lot of stuff.

01:15:09.909 --> 01:15:11.110
What do you think
you're doing, Kailey?

01:15:11.177 --> 01:15:12.177
How Abby is the same.

01:15:12.245 --> 01:15:15.214
You know the one thing
I'm gonna miss

01:15:15.281 --> 01:15:17.316
is not being able
to tell her what a true

01:15:17.384 --> 01:15:19.318
and hateful bitch...
(grunts loudly)

01:15:19.386 --> 01:15:21.320
Ow!

01:15:21.388 --> 01:15:23.555
(panting)

01:15:23.623 --> 01:15:25.557
Fuck you.
- Like I said,

01:15:25.625 --> 01:15:27.693
he wrote me
about a lot of stuff.

01:15:27.761 --> 01:15:32.398
But the thing in his letters
that's the clearest

01:15:32.465 --> 01:15:33.732
is what he never says.

01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:34.900
Yeah, what's that?

01:15:34.968 --> 01:15:37.903
He's scared of you.

01:15:37.971 --> 01:15:40.873
'Cause you're angry all the
time and he doesn't know why.

01:15:40.940 --> 01:15:42.474
And so you're taking him?

01:15:42.542 --> 01:15:44.643
Right.
So why are you telling me?

01:15:44.711 --> 01:15:47.312
You could have just taken
him without all this.

01:15:47.380 --> 01:15:49.014
'Cause I want you to know
he's going to be okay.

01:15:49.082 --> 01:15:50.449
You're pointing
a gun at me.

01:15:50.517 --> 01:15:51.850
Doesn't inspire
confidence.

01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:55.287
He's going to be fine.

01:15:55.355 --> 01:15:56.922
He's going to be better.

01:15:56.990 --> 01:15:59.992
He might actually have a couple
of fucking friends.

01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:02.394
You can get up now.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.602
(Kailey retching)

01:16:10.670 --> 01:16:12.071
Hey, Rings?

01:16:12.138 --> 01:16:13.706
You don't want to be
doing this, Rings!

01:16:13.773 --> 01:16:15.307
(toilet flushing)

01:16:15.375 --> 01:16:16.675
It's why you're sick.

01:16:17.777 --> 01:16:19.778
You know
it's wrong.

01:16:19.846 --> 01:16:21.780
Ow!

01:16:21.848 --> 01:16:23.449
God!

01:16:23.516 --> 01:16:25.084
I told you to stop
calling me that.

01:16:25.151 --> 01:16:28.087
Find yourself a little
nickname for Ellen.

01:16:28.154 --> 01:16:29.088
I don't have one.

01:16:29.155 --> 01:16:30.255
I know.

01:16:30.323 --> 01:16:31.690
I don't know when
she'll be back.

01:16:31.758 --> 01:16:33.759
Hopefully, she'll have a nice,
long breakfast somewhere

01:16:33.827 --> 01:16:35.294
and linger a bit,

01:16:35.362 --> 01:16:39.398
but until then...
just think about how I'm right.

01:16:39.466 --> 01:16:41.300
He can't be
here anymore.

01:16:41.368 --> 01:16:43.035
Something bad
will happen.

01:16:43.103 --> 01:16:45.704
Abby will push harder,
you'll drink more,

01:16:45.772 --> 01:16:48.674
something else will get broken.

01:16:52.479 --> 01:16:54.580
Just...

01:16:54.647 --> 01:16:57.216
just give me a chance.

01:16:57.283 --> 01:16:58.751
Okay? I'll take
care of him.

01:16:58.818 --> 01:17:00.753
Rings,
you don't

01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:01.754
want to do this.

01:17:01.821 --> 01:17:04.023
Rings.

01:17:04.090 --> 01:17:05.824
(clicking)

01:17:05.892 --> 01:17:07.059
(wry laugh)

01:17:07.127 --> 01:17:09.328
If you feel like you have
to call the police,

01:17:09.396 --> 01:17:12.264
just wait as long as you can.

01:17:13.366 --> 01:17:15.801
(indistinct chattering)

01:17:29.416 --> 01:17:31.850
(horn honks twice)

01:17:35.221 --> 01:17:36.321
You drive a truck?

01:17:36.389 --> 01:17:38.090
That's great.

01:17:38.158 --> 01:17:39.858
Come on, Gulls.

01:17:39.926 --> 01:17:41.860
We've got to go.

01:17:45.265 --> 01:17:47.766
But why do this to you?

01:17:47.834 --> 01:17:50.102
She wanted me to know
that he'd be okay.

01:17:50.170 --> 01:17:51.637
What?

01:17:51.705 --> 01:17:53.038
She said...

01:17:53.106 --> 01:17:56.775
he'd be better off
with her than with us.

01:17:59.579 --> 01:18:02.381
Is she right?

01:18:05.018 --> 01:18:09.154
David? Is she right?

01:18:11.424 --> 01:18:13.425
Call the police.

01:18:18.031 --> 01:18:20.366
Is there anything
I can do to help?

01:18:20.433 --> 01:18:21.867
Nope.

01:18:21.935 --> 01:18:23.369
Stay strapped in.

01:18:23.436 --> 01:18:25.804
Okay.

01:18:25.872 --> 01:18:28.774
I could help you drive.

01:18:28.842 --> 01:18:30.743
You know how to
drive standard?

01:18:30.810 --> 01:18:32.444
Yeah.

01:18:32.512 --> 01:18:34.680
No, you don't.

01:18:36.616 --> 01:18:37.883
Did you pack any
other clothes?

01:18:37.951 --> 01:18:39.651
Some, yeah,
but they're in the back.

01:18:39.719 --> 01:18:41.620
Okay, well, uh,
stay buckled in,

01:18:41.688 --> 01:18:44.356
but lose the lawyer
outfit, will you?

01:18:44.424 --> 01:18:46.358
Sure.

01:18:49.963 --> 01:18:51.096
No, you're not listening--

01:18:51.164 --> 01:18:52.765
she doesn't have
visitation rights.

01:18:52.832 --> 01:18:54.967
Nobody's seen
that woman in 11 years.

01:18:55.035 --> 01:18:57.202
Not even your grandson?

01:18:57.270 --> 01:18:58.504
Absolutely not him.

01:18:58.571 --> 01:19:00.539
She hasn't seen him
since he was born.

01:19:00.607 --> 01:19:01.874
Where was that?

01:19:01.941 --> 01:19:04.043
ABIGAIL:
Ohio, near Columbus.

01:19:05.145 --> 01:19:08.280
Where was that town?

01:19:08.348 --> 01:19:10.215
David?

01:19:10.283 --> 01:19:14.820
They may have been
writing each other.

01:19:14.888 --> 01:19:16.722
Oh, for Christ sake, David!

01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:18.691
I only just found out.

01:19:18.758 --> 01:19:20.125
How?

01:19:20.193 --> 01:19:21.460
What do you mean?

01:19:21.528 --> 01:19:23.095
You said you don't
know where she was,

01:19:23.163 --> 01:19:24.730
so how's your son
going to write her?

01:19:25.832 --> 01:19:27.900
I-I don't know.

01:19:27.967 --> 01:19:29.068
Okay.

01:19:29.135 --> 01:19:30.235
Anything else?

01:19:30.303 --> 01:19:32.638
She has a gun.

01:19:32.706 --> 01:19:35.007
You keep telling us that.

01:19:35.075 --> 01:19:38.310
At least let me shift.

01:19:38.378 --> 01:19:40.479
No.

01:19:40.547 --> 01:19:42.047
I'll roshambo you for it.

01:19:42.115 --> 01:19:43.115
You'll what?

01:19:43.183 --> 01:19:45.417
Rock, paper, scissors?

01:19:45.485 --> 01:19:47.586
Oh, for God sakes.

01:19:47.654 --> 01:19:49.455
All right, fine.

01:19:49.522 --> 01:19:52.324
I'm going to throw a rock.

01:19:52.392 --> 01:19:54.026
Really?

01:19:54.094 --> 01:19:56.028
Promise.

01:19:56.096 --> 01:19:58.864
Okay. On four, all right?

01:19:58.932 --> 01:20:01.667
Okay, one, two, three.

01:20:01.735 --> 01:20:03.535
I lied.

01:20:03.603 --> 01:20:05.170
Oh!
- Now teach me.

01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:10.109
Okay, up and towards
me is first.

01:20:10.176 --> 01:20:11.543
Down is second.

01:20:11.611 --> 01:20:12.978
Up and towards
you is third.

01:20:13.046 --> 01:20:14.113
Down is fourth.

01:20:14.180 --> 01:20:15.414
Okay, that's pretty much it.

01:20:15.482 --> 01:20:17.750
But you gotta do it
when I push in the clutch,

01:20:17.817 --> 01:20:20.119
otherwise it's going to make
a terrible noise and we crash.

01:20:20.186 --> 01:20:21.120
Okay?
Okay.

01:20:21.187 --> 01:20:22.855
First.

01:20:24.858 --> 01:20:26.592
Second.

01:20:29.029 --> 01:20:30.896
Third.

01:20:32.432 --> 01:20:34.333
That's fourth.

01:20:34.401 --> 01:20:36.168
I can't believe
you cheated.

01:20:44.644 --> 01:20:46.412
No letters.

01:20:46.479 --> 01:20:47.713
All of it's
schoolwork.

01:20:50.650 --> 01:20:52.584
I looked through
those already.

01:21:05.699 --> 01:21:08.200
Where the hell is
Chasm Falls, New York?

01:21:08.268 --> 01:21:09.601
We'll find out.

01:21:09.669 --> 01:21:11.537
But Quinn's Billiards
should be pretty easy.

01:21:14.207 --> 01:21:16.208
Goddamn it.

01:21:30.623 --> 01:21:32.925
You know some woman
named Kailey Sullivan?

01:21:32.992 --> 01:21:34.059
Oh, fuck.

01:21:34.127 --> 01:21:35.294
Did she wreck my truck?

01:21:35.362 --> 01:21:38.364
Why would she wreck your truck?

01:21:38.431 --> 01:21:40.032
Because she thinks it's hers.

01:21:40.100 --> 01:21:43.736
Excuse me.
You Mr. Quinette?

01:21:50.910 --> 01:21:53.012
Hey, Gulls.

01:21:53.079 --> 01:21:54.980
You try to get
some sleep, okay?

01:21:55.048 --> 01:21:56.515
We've still got a ways.

01:21:56.583 --> 01:21:58.717
No, I'm okay.

01:22:04.624 --> 01:22:08.394
What do you think Dad's
doing right now?

01:22:08.461 --> 01:22:11.930
I think he's
worried about you.

01:22:14.067 --> 01:22:18.437
I just hope he
isn't mean to Ellen.

01:22:18.505 --> 01:22:21.940
You want to write
him a letter?

01:22:22.008 --> 01:22:25.210
No. Maybe some time
but not right now.

01:22:25.278 --> 01:22:27.112
Why not?

01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:29.248
It would just make
him even madder.

01:22:32.485 --> 01:22:33.652
Well, we'll write
him a letter

01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:36.588
whenever
you want, okay?

01:22:36.656 --> 01:22:38.657
Go to sleep, Gulls.

01:22:59.646 --> 01:23:03.449
(horn honking)

01:23:03.516 --> 01:23:04.983
How far is Canada?
It's not far.

01:23:05.051 --> 01:23:07.686
Probably about 20
miles up there.

01:23:07.754 --> 01:23:10.089
We've got to catch a bus.

01:23:10.156 --> 01:23:12.157
Let's just drive.

01:23:12.225 --> 01:23:13.492
We can't.

01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:15.327
Hey, Gulls, listen.

01:23:15.395 --> 01:23:19.231
On the bus, if anyone asks,
you're a very sick kid.

01:23:19.299 --> 01:23:21.700
Like a cold?

01:23:21.768 --> 01:23:24.269
No, maybe even
worse than that.

01:23:24.337 --> 01:23:25.871
Escarole poisoning?

01:23:25.939 --> 01:23:27.106
What is that?

01:23:27.173 --> 01:23:29.775
I guess like food poisoning.

01:23:29.843 --> 01:23:33.212
No. Uh, worse than that.

01:23:56.536 --> 01:23:58.871
I've got to get my bag first.

01:24:03.877 --> 01:24:05.744
What time is it?

01:24:05.812 --> 01:24:06.912
Almost 5:30.

01:24:09.683 --> 01:24:11.950
And remember, worse than
escarole poisoning, okay?

01:24:23.697 --> 01:24:25.497
(coughs)

01:24:25.565 --> 01:24:26.799
WOMAN:
Morning.

01:24:26.866 --> 01:24:27.900
Morning.

01:24:27.967 --> 01:24:29.001
You're new.

01:24:29.069 --> 01:24:30.903
Yeah.

01:24:33.139 --> 01:24:35.140
Mom, I'm starving.

01:24:35.208 --> 01:24:36.875
The bus will
be here soon.

01:24:36.943 --> 01:24:40.212
No, it'll be late.
It always is.

01:24:42.716 --> 01:24:45.751
Uh, I'll go get us
some donuts, okay?

01:24:45.819 --> 01:24:46.919
Stay here.

01:25:03.603 --> 01:25:07.239
Can I get, uh, four
plain cake donuts,

01:25:07.307 --> 01:25:08.640
a milk and a large coffee?

01:25:08.708 --> 01:25:10.242
I don't have any
regular coffee.

01:25:10.310 --> 01:25:11.276
I just have decaf.

01:25:11.344 --> 01:25:13.245
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

01:25:15.615 --> 01:25:16.548
I drank it all.

01:25:16.616 --> 01:25:19.351
Fine. Just, uh,
give me a decaf.

01:25:24.024 --> 01:25:26.392
Mom?

01:25:26.459 --> 01:25:28.560
Gull, I told you
to stay in line.

01:25:36.102 --> 01:25:38.871
(indistinct police radio
transmission)

01:25:48.448 --> 01:25:49.848
(siren whoops)

01:26:01.361 --> 01:26:02.828
(tires squealing)

01:26:02.896 --> 01:26:03.962
Kailey? Kailey?

01:26:04.030 --> 01:26:06.098
I need you
to stop running now.

01:26:06.166 --> 01:26:08.000
Kailey?

01:26:08.068 --> 01:26:10.402
Look at me. Look at me.

01:26:11.404 --> 01:26:12.438
Kailey!

01:26:14.207 --> 01:26:17.443
No, no, no, leave the bag!
Leave the gun!

01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:18.711
Kailey! No!
(gun cocking)

01:26:21.081 --> 01:26:22.481
Mom!

01:26:22.549 --> 01:26:24.283
Okay. Get in the truck.

01:26:30.423 --> 01:26:32.257
(groans)

01:26:32.325 --> 01:26:34.293
No, it's okay.

01:26:34.361 --> 01:26:36.862
Okay. It's okay.
I'm fine, Gulls.

01:26:36.930 --> 01:26:42.267
I just... I just need you
to shift again, okay?

01:26:42.335 --> 01:26:45.137
Just... I'll get you into first,

01:26:45.205 --> 01:26:48.273
but from then on,
it's all you, kid. Okay?

01:26:48.341 --> 01:26:50.209
(whimpering)
Okay, come on.

01:26:50.276 --> 01:26:53.012
That's my boy.

01:27:01.454 --> 01:27:03.722

01:28:04.851 --> 01:28:07.453
Hey. You Gulley?

01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:09.588
Yeah, I am.

01:28:09.656 --> 01:28:12.007
I got a letter for you.
