Previously on Billions...

00:10.375 --> 00:13.542
Today you're the man
who brought down Lawrence Boyd.

00:13.542 --> 00:14.500
You're under arrest.

00:14.500 --> 00:17.000
Today you're Elvis.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.083
The only question now is --

00:19.083 --> 00:21.542
which mansion will it be,
Gracie or the Governor's?

00:21.542 --> 00:23.291
Head of Crim.
Man, plum purchase.

Freaking launch pad

Hang for a minute, Bryan.

00:34.917 --> 00:37.125
Listen to what
Bobby has to say.

00:37.125 --> 00:40.291
Come work for Bach's firm,
on my account.

00:40.291 --> 00:43.125
You know
what Rhoades is, Bryan,

00:43.125 --> 00:46.667
and I know
you made that call.

00:46.667 --> 00:49.667
What did you do to get Axelrod
to drop his civil suits?

00:49.667 --> 00:51.708
I went back to work
at Axe Capital.

00:51.708 --> 00:53.041
I'm happy
that it works for you.

00:53.041 --> 00:57.333
But for us, I'm afraid
it's a deal breaker.

00:57.333 --> 00:59.667
If you ever decide
to grapple with

00:59.667 --> 01:01.959
why you feel happiness
for you can only exist

01:01.959 --> 01:06.000

21-year-old girls, come see me.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.834
We can fix that quick.

the meeting.

01:16.750 --> 01:17.542
If they don't get
the casino,

01:17.542 --> 01:19.291
it goes from something
to consider

01:19.291 --> 01:20.875
to something
to never think about again.

01:20.875 --> 01:22.917
Move forward
with the bond.

01:22.917 --> 01:24.875
The casino is
coming to Sandicot.

01:24.875 --> 01:26.959
We are committing to this play.

01:26.959 --> 01:29.583
Sandicot's not getting
the gaming license.

really hurt with this move.

not something anyone did.

03:09.333 --> 03:10.208
That is the kind

03:10.208 --> 03:11.750
You vetted the info yourself.

03:11.750 --> 03:14.000
I did.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.375

whoever put you up to this

03:34.250 --> 03:37.750
Yes, you do.
Now, who paid you?

03:37.750 --> 03:40.291
No one even knew
who I was going to

03:40.291 --> 03:43.375
for the financing,
not at first.

03:43.375 --> 03:45.333
It's some kind of
Albany machine shit.

a distant part of the state.

03:54.625 --> 03:56.083
"Fottuto"
means getting fucked.

03:56.083 --> 03:58.083
I picked that up
in context.

down here.

No, the Boyd business kept me
living at the office,

I'd spend the day

04:28.333 --> 04:29.583

04:36.041 --> 04:38.458
There's someone
I'd like you to meet.

04:38.458 --> 04:39.667
This is Mike Dimonda,

04:39.667 --> 04:43.708
an excellent and very
influential young journalist.

04:43.708 --> 04:45.542
Mike, my son Kevin.

04:45.542 --> 04:46.708
Nice to meet you, sir.

04:46.708 --> 04:47.834
Helluva handshake, Kevin.

Skinny post.

This is the kind of
unadulterated high point

04:59.625 --> 05:02.750
that rarely comes along.
It's hard to see what more

05:02.750 --> 05:04.542
there is for you to gain
as U.S. Attorney.

05:04.542 --> 05:06.166

plans to run for Governor?

05:06.166 --> 05:08.417
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:08.417 --> 05:10.208
-Where'd you get that?
-What I hear is

05:10.208 --> 05:11.750
you're taking
a quick victory lap,

05:11.750 --> 05:14.083
and then it's City Hall,
Capitol Building, or Albany.

05:14.083 --> 05:18.458
I would never even consider it
while still in office.

05:18.458 --> 05:22.125
You will be the first
to know should that change.

Do you mind if I, uh,
shoot a few of you guys

05:24.417 --> 05:26.583

Or is that private?

05:26.583 --> 05:28.166
It is.

05:29.208 --> 05:31.291
But if you think
it has some value,

05:31.291 --> 05:32.959
then... we can make
an exception.

05:32.959 --> 05:35.583

you'd be back later.

07:20.583 --> 07:24.166
Yeah, well,
we had our catch.

07:24.166 --> 07:27.875
Then Dad did the interview,
and we came home.

07:27.875 --> 07:30.333
Bye, Dad.

07:33.083 --> 07:34.792
You said you wanted
to spend the day with him.

07:34.792 --> 07:38.417
Yeah, I said I wanted to spend
time with him, and I did.

07:38.417 --> 07:40.333
You used him as a prop.

07:40.333 --> 07:41.667

you'd never do,

your father did to you.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.375
We spent the morning
at the park.

07:48.375 --> 07:49.291
And a reporter
happened upon us

07:49.291 --> 07:51.542
because, at the moment,

07:51.542 --> 07:53.708
I am news-worthy.

07:53.708 --> 07:54.959
Finally in a good way.

07:54.959 --> 07:57.125
I'm sure it's a wonderful lesson
for Kevin

07:57.125 --> 07:59.375
-on what really matters.
-Indeed it was.

07:59.375 --> 08:01.083
He got to run around
a little bit,

08:01.083 --> 08:02.959
and he got some exposure

08:02.959 --> 08:05.834
as to how you finesse relations
with the fourth estate.

08:08.250 --> 08:10.792
That is exactly
the kind of half-truth

08:10.792 --> 08:13.792
that's led to our
current situation.

08:13.792 --> 08:14.708
As is your failure
to tell me

08:14.708 --> 08:17.625
you were going back
to work for Axelrod.

08:17.625 --> 08:18.875
Oh, my God.

08:18.875 --> 08:22.417
Oh, I had to Columbo
that one for myself.

08:22.417 --> 08:24.250
Yet it seems
that I'm required

08:24.250 --> 08:26.542

of how I spend my time.

08:26.542 --> 08:28.667
No, you're not.

08:28.667 --> 08:29.792
yes, complete transparency,
but otherwise,

08:29.792 --> 08:32.875

anything, so you know, go.

Do whatever the fuck you want,
and so will I.

08:35.208 --> 08:37.375
Oh, there it goes.
There it goes.

08:37.375 --> 08:41.792
Your justification...

08:41.792 --> 08:45.125
slid in there so maybe
I would realize it later.

08:45.125 --> 08:47.750
But there it was.

08:49.667 --> 08:51.792
You want the freedom
to see other people.

08:54.959 --> 08:57.500
Yes.

I want freedom...

08:59.166 --> 09:01.291

09:01.291 --> 09:03.166
And I would be free,
as well.

how to get us un-fucked.

09:34.291 --> 09:36.000
The gaming license
was the guarantee

09:36.000 --> 09:37.208
that Sandicot
would pay off the notes.

09:49.625 --> 09:52.250
There's no road

I don't give a shit

09:54.125 --> 09:56.333

Isn't there anyone we can
sell this turd to?

10:01.083 --> 10:03.417
Not without taking
a nine-figure haircut.

10:03.417 --> 10:05.041
Same goes

You don't need to whisper it
like it's some dark spell

10:12.708 --> 10:15.625
that'll come true
if you say it too loudly.

10:15.625 --> 10:17.542
It kind of is, though,
isn't it?

10:21.708 --> 10:23.667
Yeah.
Because once you say it,

10:23.667 --> 10:26.208
you realize
it's your only option.

10:26.208 --> 10:26.959
Austerity.

10:26.959 --> 10:29.834
Okay.
Step it out for everyone.

10:31.125 --> 10:34.708
Well, the note exchange requires
that the town pay you first,

10:34.708 --> 10:37.083
before any of its other
financial obligations,

10:37.083 --> 10:39.375
like union contracts
with town workers,

10:39.375 --> 10:41.125
teachers' salaries,
all that.

10:41.125 --> 10:43.208
Austerity just means
you enforce that.

10:43.208 --> 10:46.000
Yes. Go ahead,
seize their assets,

10:46.000 --> 10:47.875
like Singer did
in Argentina.

10:47.875 --> 10:49.125
What kind of assets?

10:49.125 --> 10:51.625
Sandicot is not an entire
South American country.

10:51.625 --> 10:53.917
Right. We wouldn't be
skimming cream off the top.

10:53.917 --> 10:55.792
We'd be gutting them
for their organs,

10:55.792 --> 10:57.250
like in a Korean
horror movie.

10:57.250 --> 11:01.000
You'd be mostly looking at land,
buildings, and utilities.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.708
Town also has
an original Remington.

11:02.708 --> 11:05.291
It's worth upwards
of $900,000.

11:05.291 --> 11:06.417
The fuck's a Remington?

11:06.417 --> 11:09.750
Frederic. American artist
from the 19th century.

11:09.750 --> 11:12.458
He specialized in depictions
of the Old West.

11:14.041 --> 11:17.083
I took Art History
for the automatic A.

11:17.083 --> 11:18.458
Some of it stuck.

11:18.458 --> 11:20.625
If you force them
to pay you,

11:20.625 --> 11:22.708
the county would have
to severely cut back

11:22.708 --> 11:24.708
on its municipal workforce,
roll back labor contracts,

11:24.708 --> 11:27.333
and pillage
its pension funds.

11:27.333 --> 11:28.792
Eventually they'd have
to shutter some schools,

11:28.792 --> 11:30.500
leading
to overpopulated classrooms

11:30.500 --> 11:33.083
and forced free periods.

11:33.083 --> 11:36.000
Decreased graduation rates,
increased crime.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.708
They would be consolidation
of hospitals, fire houses.

11:38.708 --> 11:41.750
There would also be
cuts in police manpower.

11:41.750 --> 11:44.000
Which would bring other
kinds of problems.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.500
The effects are viral.

11:45.500 --> 11:47.333
The losses spin off
to the businesses

11:47.333 --> 11:49.125
that provide services
to the town.

11:49.125 --> 11:51.041
Other area businesses
start to close,

11:51.041 --> 11:52.708
and more jobs are lost.

11:52.708 --> 11:55.917
Won't all this be
a PR nightmare?

11:55.917 --> 11:58.917
PR that comes with losing that
much money is a nightmare, too.

11:58.917 --> 12:00.708
And we lose the money.

12:00.708 --> 12:03.125
I don't like any of
the answers I'm hearing.

12:03.125 --> 12:05.208
There has to be a way
to get this done

12:05.208 --> 12:06.375
without destroying the place.

12:06.375 --> 12:08.375
Model it up for me.

12:08.375 --> 12:11.417
All scenarios.

12:17.458 --> 12:22.291
Son, I did something today

12:22.291 --> 12:24.667
that is gonna
absolutely floor you.

12:24.667 --> 12:25.500
I thought you went
golfing today.

12:25.500 --> 12:29.333
I did. Played my 18,

12:29.333 --> 12:31.250
and then I withdrew
my membership

12:31.250 --> 12:33.125
from the Garden City
Golf Club.

12:33.125 --> 12:36.083
Oh, that's
your natural habitat.

12:36.083 --> 12:39.417
Few places a man
can be as comfortable.

12:39.417 --> 12:42.208
But it was time.

12:42.208 --> 12:44.083
They don't allow women.

12:44.083 --> 12:46.291
And I cannot be a member
of a restricted club anymore.

12:46.291 --> 12:48.333
Noble.

12:48.333 --> 12:51.083
Anticipatory.
Of the future.

12:51.083 --> 12:52.041
That's baked right
into the word.

12:52.041 --> 12:56.041
Your future,
which should start right now.

12:56.041 --> 12:57.917
It's unethical for me
to run while --

12:57.917 --> 13:01.333
The Tappan Institute
commissioned a poll.

13:01.333 --> 13:04.417
Oh, your buddy Tate Tappan's
think tank just happened --

13:04.417 --> 13:06.625
Independent.

13:06.625 --> 13:09.083
No connection to me.

13:09.083 --> 13:09.959
The results are quite --

13:09.959 --> 13:13.125
I don't want to hear
anything about it.

13:17.959 --> 13:20.208
No, I've just gotten out
from under a cloud.

13:20.208 --> 13:23.792
If word leaks out about a poll
while I'm in office,

13:23.792 --> 13:26.458
that is gonna be
a darker cloud.

13:26.458 --> 13:28.667
What is this, then?

13:30.708 --> 13:32.959
That's Camelot right there.

13:32.959 --> 13:34.625
Don't try to spin it.

13:34.625 --> 13:38.875
That is a picture of a man
running for office.

13:41.667 --> 13:45.125
You're doing more
than just dreaming about it.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.792
I'll send you
those poll results.

13:46.792 --> 13:49.000
I think they're
gonna be encouraging.

13:50.792 --> 13:55.583
But you're gonna have
to resolve things with Wendy.

13:55.583 --> 13:59.000
You cannot be
an effective candidate

13:59.000 --> 14:00.125
if your marriage
is in the crapper.

14:00.125 --> 14:03.125
That's not really
a thing anymore, Dad.

14:03.125 --> 14:05.875
That I'd need a woman standing
behind me on the podium,

14:05.875 --> 14:08.000
that's archaic.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.333
Son, you do know
why you need her

14:10.333 --> 14:12.083
in your life, don't you?

14:14.000 --> 14:18.917
She is
a natural-born killer.

14:18.917 --> 14:22.583
That's what she builds,
all day...killers.

14:23.667 --> 14:25.834
You're a good candidate.

14:25.834 --> 14:29.500
She'd make you
unstoppable.

14:32.458 --> 14:35.333
Don't get your hopes up.

14:35.333 --> 14:38.166
Oh, you still got
your shucking skills.

14:38.166 --> 14:40.291
Summer job on City Island
when I was 14.

14:40.291 --> 14:43.583
For the record,
I am not eating any of those.

14:43.583 --> 14:47.542
♪ dramatic music  ♪

15:04.542 --> 15:05.667
Any answers?

15:05.667 --> 15:06.959
Getting there.

15:06.959 --> 15:10.375
Marc was absolutely
not conning you.

15:10.375 --> 15:12.125
No wires or transfers.

15:12.125 --> 15:14.083
No evidence

15:14.083 --> 15:16.291
or altered behavior
whatsoever

15:16.291 --> 15:18.166
in him, the wife,
or other family.

15:18.166 --> 15:19.959
So he was conned
right along with me.

15:19.959 --> 15:22.500
The Gaming Facility
Location Board

15:22.500 --> 15:25.291
reassigned the license
to Kingsford at the last minute.

15:25.291 --> 15:26.583
I confirmed that.

15:26.583 --> 15:29.291
A guy named Joe Scolari
made the call to switch.

15:29.291 --> 15:30.583
No one motivated him?

15:30.583 --> 15:32.375
It's hard to pinpoint
where the idea

15:32.375 --> 15:33.208
to change
even originated,

15:33.208 --> 15:35.792
or who he's trying
to keep happy.

15:35.792 --> 15:36.917
But I do know that
these things don't move

15:36.917 --> 15:38.750
unless somebody orders
it to happen.

15:38.750 --> 15:41.166
Okay.
Stay on it.

15:41.166 --> 15:43.083
I'm gonna get with Scolari,
see if I can get a read on him.

15:50.667 --> 15:53.583
Thank you for agreeing
to meet, Senator Scolari.

15:53.583 --> 15:55.834
Oh, call me Joe.

15:55.834 --> 15:58.792
What brings you up
the Thruway?

15:58.792 --> 16:00.542
You looking for approval
for another,

16:00.542 --> 16:03.208
uh, outdoor shower at your place
in the Hamptons?

16:04.458 --> 16:07.250
Well, if you've gone to so
much trouble to research me,

16:07.250 --> 16:08.417
you must know why.

16:08.417 --> 16:10.500
I'm here as an investor
in New York State

16:10.500 --> 16:12.625
meeting with one its finest
representatives.

16:12.625 --> 16:14.500
Of course.

16:14.500 --> 16:17.875
I know about the note
exchange on Sandicot.

16:17.875 --> 16:20.166
And I want you to know
the Location Board

16:20.166 --> 16:23.750
doesn't take matters
of gaming licenses lightly.

16:24.583 --> 16:27.125
The committee chose
the location

16:27.125 --> 16:28.959
that would bring
the greatest benefit

16:28.959 --> 16:31.125
to the greatest
number of people.

16:31.125 --> 16:33.083
That turned out
to be Kingsford.

16:33.083 --> 16:35.417
Oh, I believe that
the state-appointed board,

16:35.417 --> 16:36.750
handpicked
by the Governor,

16:36.750 --> 16:39.000
would be nothing
short of rigorous.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
Thing is, I have it
on good authority

16:42.000 --> 16:43.959
that Sandicot
was gonna get that license.

16:43.959 --> 16:48.500
So the late switch
seems... odd.

16:48.500 --> 16:52.333
Our process always
seems odd to outsiders.

16:52.333 --> 16:55.667
That's where the whole
sausage-making thing comes from.

16:55.667 --> 16:57.417
But let me reassure you,

16:57.417 --> 17:00.625
there was nothing out
of the ordinary about it.

17:00.625 --> 17:02.041
The committee
chose the location

17:02.041 --> 17:04.792
that would bring
the greatest benefit

17:04.792 --> 17:06.291
to the greatest
number of people.

17:06.291 --> 17:07.834
That turned out
to be Kingsford.

17:07.834 --> 17:09.750
Yeah, no, you said.

17:09.750 --> 17:11.917
What I was looking for
is a specific reason

17:11.917 --> 17:14.417
that decision was made.

17:14.417 --> 17:16.417
Oh.

17:16.417 --> 17:18.708
You want specifics.

17:18.708 --> 17:22.708
Details into our process.

17:22.708 --> 17:23.875
Inner workings and so forth.

17:23.875 --> 17:26.375
That would be helpful.

17:26.375 --> 17:26.875
Sure.

17:26.875 --> 17:29.166
I can share that.

17:29.166 --> 17:32.166
The committee
chose the location

17:32.166 --> 17:33.166
that would bring
the greatest benefit

17:33.166 --> 17:36.458
to the greatest
number of people.

17:36.458 --> 17:39.375
That turned out
to be Kingsford.

17:39.375 --> 17:44.375
Just as I'm sure you took
on the obligations of Sandicot

17:44.375 --> 17:46.583
for the good
of those fine people.

17:55.834 --> 17:59.208
I hope this has been as much fun
for you as it has for me.

17:59.208 --> 18:01.250
Absolutely.

18:03.875 --> 18:08.750
♪ dramatic music  ♪

18:14.792 --> 18:16.792

of his own decisions.

18:16.792 --> 18:19.083

right out of his back.

18:19.083 --> 18:21.041
And it's the Governor
who's pulling it.

18:21.041 --> 18:23.291

what I can find out.

18:23.291 --> 18:25.750
I didn't sleep last night.

18:26.875 --> 18:27.917
Your numbers
have been strong,

18:27.917 --> 18:30.834
even in a tough market.

18:30.834 --> 18:34.041
Yeah, they have been.

18:34.041 --> 18:36.250
So what was it
kept you up?

18:36.250 --> 18:37.583
Russian hackers.

18:39.166 --> 18:41.750
They can fuck with us
so easily,

18:41.750 --> 18:44.208
in ways we can't
even comprehend.

an entire airline

18:48.125 --> 18:50.333
Thousands of people
stranded.

18:50.333 --> 18:52.291
So your fear is, uh, what?

18:52.291 --> 18:55.834
These hackers targeting you?
The entire market?

18:55.834 --> 18:56.792
My portfolio could
go up in flames.

18:56.792 --> 18:58.291

19:00.333 --> 19:03.208
When did you start
losing sleep over it?

19:03.208 --> 19:05.542
Just last night.

19:05.542 --> 19:06.333
Anything happen
yesterday?

19:06.333 --> 19:08.834
I had to go out
to Axe's house

19:08.834 --> 19:11.625
in the Hamptons
for a special meeting.

19:11.625 --> 19:14.458
Axe bought the distressed debt
on this town upstate.

19:14.458 --> 19:16.125
Now they're defaulting.
It's a shit load of money.

19:16.125 --> 19:18.500
What do you think
you should do?

19:20.000 --> 19:22.125
Well,
what are the options?

19:22.125 --> 19:25.250
Austerity.
Or lose money.

19:35.542 --> 19:37.417
Do you see the connection?

19:37.417 --> 19:39.041
With the hackers?

19:41.166 --> 19:42.834
You're saying
we're like them?

19:42.834 --> 19:44.083
They're agents of chaos

19:44.083 --> 19:45.917
who can destabilize
all our lives

19:45.917 --> 19:47.750
just because
they feel like it.

19:47.750 --> 19:49.708
Who are you to
those people upstate?

19:49.708 --> 19:50.500
-Chaos.
-Yes.

19:52.291 --> 19:54.750
Axe Cap
is the agent of chaos.

19:54.750 --> 19:58.375
You know what
austerity means.

19:58.375 --> 20:01.500
You guys traverse
moral and legal gray areas

20:01.500 --> 20:03.500
all the time,
but you can live with it

20:03.500 --> 20:06.333
because you're rarely aware
of anyone getting hurt by it.

20:06.333 --> 20:10.041
With this town, you know
exactly who's getting hurt,

20:10.041 --> 20:11.917
and where they're gonna
feel their pain.

20:11.917 --> 20:14.417
And how their lives
are gonna spin out of control

20:14.417 --> 20:16.625
because of decisions made
in your presence,

20:16.625 --> 20:19.834
at a fucking mansion
in the Hamptons.

20:19.834 --> 20:21.000
I don't even know
that it's wrong for him

20:21.000 --> 20:24.834
to do what he's doing...

20:24.834 --> 20:27.708
only that I don't like
how it makes me feel.

20:27.708 --> 20:30.208
This is all connected.

20:32.834 --> 20:35.959
When a situation starts
affecting you

20:35.959 --> 20:38.750
so much
you can't sleep,

20:38.750 --> 20:41.041
you have to take action.

20:41.041 --> 20:42.542
Fighting for those people

20:42.542 --> 20:46.500
and fighting for yourself
are one and the same.

20:53.542 --> 20:57.708
I taught elementary
school for 30 years,

20:57.708 --> 21:00.208
always contributing
to my pension.

21:03.834 --> 21:07.333
That was my nest egg
for retirement.

21:07.333 --> 21:10.750
Then that nest egg
got invested.

21:10.750 --> 21:15.750
But the town it was invested in
mismanaged its finances.

21:15.750 --> 21:19.667
And now they don't want
to pay what they owe,

21:19.667 --> 21:22.041
and my retirement
is threatened.

21:25.625 --> 21:28.417
A spot like this will kick off
our Astroturf campaign

21:28.417 --> 21:30.750
to make it look like
the area's getting a bailout

21:30.750 --> 21:31.417
and not a death sentence.

21:31.417 --> 21:33.458
Commercials like this one,

21:33.458 --> 21:35.000
but specific to Sandicot,

21:35.000 --> 21:37.041
sell the idea
that our investors,

21:37.041 --> 21:38.625
teachers from the Midwest,

21:38.625 --> 21:41.417
hardworking, responsible people
from all over,

21:41.417 --> 21:42.375
they are the ones who suffer

21:42.375 --> 21:44.959
if Sandicot
is allowed to default.

21:44.959 --> 21:47.750
Make it clear that we are
the ones willing to negotiate.

21:47.750 --> 21:49.458
It's the town
that's being difficult.

21:49.458 --> 21:51.875
Of course.
Sandicot is being uncooperative.

21:51.875 --> 21:52.875
We'll say all that.

21:52.875 --> 21:54.834
Any questions?

21:57.291 --> 21:59.083
Danzig.

21:59.083 --> 22:00.208
You're being awfully quiet.

22:00.208 --> 22:04.583
Are we really
gonna do this?

22:04.583 --> 22:07.458
I mean, we can make
some market moves

22:07.458 --> 22:11.458
and potentially pick up some of
the losses by next quarter.

22:11.458 --> 22:13.125
We're making it look
like our investors are down

22:13.125 --> 22:15.417
to eating cat food.

22:15.417 --> 22:18.166
The people up there are sure
to turn to the media

22:18.166 --> 22:21.792
and to cry poor,
to play the victim card.

22:21.792 --> 22:23.458
It makes sense for us
to point out

22:23.458 --> 22:25.708
that there are
other victims.

22:25.708 --> 22:26.834
Exactly.

22:26.834 --> 22:30.041
But we are not
really the victims.

22:30.041 --> 22:30.583
They are.

22:33.041 --> 22:35.000
I kind of feel
like he's right.

22:36.667 --> 22:40.333
We could hold the debt,
take a short-term loss,

22:40.333 --> 22:43.667
but then take the lead
in re-growing Sandicot,

22:43.667 --> 22:45.834
redeveloping the downtown.

22:45.834 --> 22:47.250
Uh, create a food hall

22:47.250 --> 22:51.375
or bring in
a minor-league team.

22:52.959 --> 22:55.458
Taylor, something you want
to add to that?

22:58.542 --> 22:59.750
Yes.

23:01.917 --> 23:03.458
It is unfortunate --
offensive, actually --

23:03.458 --> 23:05.750
to even be talking
about this,

23:05.750 --> 23:08.041
and that people have
to live in near-poverty.

23:11.458 --> 23:14.542
But in many ways,
a town is like a business.

23:14.542 --> 23:17.875
And when a business
operates beyond its means,

23:17.875 --> 23:18.792
when numbers don't add up,

23:18.792 --> 23:21.083
and the people
in charge continue on,

23:21.083 --> 23:22.708
heedless of that face,
sure that some sugar daddy,

23:22.708 --> 23:25.708
usually in the form
of the Federal Government,

23:25.708 --> 23:28.708
will come along and scoop them
up and cover the shortfalls,

23:28.708 --> 23:31.625
well, that  truly
offends me.

23:34.542 --> 23:37.542
People might say
you hurt this town.

23:37.542 --> 23:41.583
But in my opinion,
the town put the hurt on itself.

23:41.583 --> 23:43.125
Corrections are in order.

23:43.125 --> 23:44.583
There's a way
to make this work,

23:44.583 --> 23:46.750
and that way is hard,
but necessary.

23:46.750 --> 23:50.834
As Taleb says,
"Become antifragile, or die."

23:50.834 --> 23:54.083
Once we do this, the town
will face that challenge

23:54.083 --> 23:56.250
and come out stronger.

23:56.250 --> 23:58.083
Or it will cease being.

23:58.083 --> 23:59.083
Either result
absolutely natural,

It's where Senator Vandeveer
brought me when she told me

25:59.542 --> 26:02.500
I was being appointed
U.S. Attorney.

26:02.500 --> 26:05.083
And it's where I always
thought I would take you

26:05.083 --> 26:07.542
when you'd earned the promotion
to Head of Crim.

26:09.875 --> 26:12.417
Mutton's an interesting
euphemism, isn't it?

26:12.417 --> 26:15.792
Well,
nobody ever says "sheep."

26:15.792 --> 26:18.458
But who wants to eat
something so adorable, right?

26:18.458 --> 26:21.333
So it's a mutton chop.

26:22.542 --> 26:24.667
Definitely
less objectionable.

26:26.875 --> 26:30.125
The kangaroo industry
recently tried that.

26:31.834 --> 26:33.250
-Did they?
-Yes.

26:33.250 --> 26:35.291
In fact, there was a
country-wide survey

26:35.291 --> 26:36.917
to pick a name,

26:36.917 --> 26:39.166
and they settled
on "Australus."

26:39.166 --> 26:41.041
But not for the same
reason as a sheep.

26:41.041 --> 26:44.959
No, this was
entirely different.

26:44.959 --> 26:48.583
Seems the kangaroo has a great
deal in common with the rat.

26:50.333 --> 26:52.708
Hence, "Australus."

26:52.708 --> 26:56.041
I mean, it's elegant,
don't you think?

26:56.041 --> 26:58.458
And yet,
even by any other name,

26:58.458 --> 27:01.750
there's still a slab
of giant rat

32:41.208 --> 32:42.792
I'm still glad
you're in here

33:09.333 --> 33:10.083

our reputation,

33:17.291 --> 33:18.959
pressing our advantage

fucking with my head,

35:48.333 --> 35:49.917
undermining
my sense of purpose.

35:49.917 --> 35:55.792
Your job
is not your purpose.

35:55.792 --> 35:57.583
Chuck is not your savior.

35:57.583 --> 36:00.667
And if I'm not your friend,

36:00.667 --> 36:02.834
you have no friends.

36:02.834 --> 36:05.000
Fuck your client,

36:05.000 --> 36:06.583
and fuck you, too.

36:14.750 --> 36:16.000
Stop.

36:38.917 --> 36:42.708
Upside-down day,
breakfast for dinner.

36:44.583 --> 36:45.708
No thanks.

36:45.708 --> 36:47.458
You always thought
that your mother

36:47.458 --> 36:50.250
made those waffles
from scratch.

36:50.250 --> 36:51.750
I was eating Eggos?

36:51.750 --> 36:54.000
Yeah, she heated them
on the griddle.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.291
I used the toaster.

36:56.291 --> 36:59.875
Put some syrup on it,
it's delicious.

36:59.875 --> 37:02.291
So...

37:02.291 --> 37:04.000
the poll results.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.583
What do you think?

37:06.583 --> 37:10.083
I think I'm ready to...

37:10.083 --> 37:11.417
explore.

37:11.417 --> 37:14.458
-That's my boy.
-It's just preliminary.

37:14.458 --> 37:16.625
I'm not committing
to anything.

37:16.625 --> 37:19.250
-I hear you.
-'Cause the thing is,

37:19.250 --> 37:21.875
I'm really not sure
that I finished my mission.

37:21.875 --> 37:24.834
Well,
who ever does, kid?

37:24.834 --> 37:28.041
You can weigh all that
from your goddamn nursing home.

37:28.041 --> 37:31.041
The poll...

37:31.041 --> 37:33.542
What did you learn?

37:37.959 --> 37:40.583
Well, uh...

37:40.583 --> 37:43.250
it's pretty clear
what my vulnerabilities are.

37:43.250 --> 37:45.375
My upstate numbers
are weak.

37:45.375 --> 37:48.000
They are, but we can buff
and polish you up there.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.792
I am not worried about that.

37:53.125 --> 37:55.750
How do I go about this?

37:55.750 --> 37:57.125
What do I do first?

37:57.125 --> 37:59.583
First thing we do
is we get you anointed.

37:59.583 --> 38:02.917
Ah.
The whispered names.

38:02.917 --> 38:04.667
You have to really
know them now.

38:04.667 --> 38:07.667
One at least --
Black Jack Foley.

38:07.667 --> 38:08.750
I haven't heard that
one in quite awhile.

38:08.750 --> 38:11.500
By design.

38:11.500 --> 38:13.208
You need some
personal time with him

38:13.208 --> 38:14.125
so that he can take
your measure,

38:14.125 --> 38:17.750
and so he'll bless you.

38:19.083 --> 38:19.834
Things still run
through him?

38:19.834 --> 38:22.750
Indeed.

38:22.750 --> 38:24.417
Now...

38:24.417 --> 38:30.208
I want you to get his
granddaughter a clerkship.

38:31.125 --> 38:34.583
Then we wait
for the call.

39:07.166 --> 39:09.417
Hi.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.041
Hmmm.

39:31.041 --> 39:34.583
Hmmm.
Morning.

39:36.083 --> 39:39.083
How'd you sleep?

39:39.083 --> 39:41.041
Good.

39:47.834 --> 39:51.250
You know, uh,
my life moves fast.

39:52.708 --> 39:56.208
And I tend to avoid
the kind of connections

39:56.208 --> 39:59.708
that lead to dependence
or can slow me down.

39:59.708 --> 40:01.125
I know.

40:01.125 --> 40:05.667
Weightlessness
is a priority for you.

40:05.667 --> 40:07.500
It's one of
the reasons I called.

40:07.500 --> 40:11.917
Doesn't this seem like
a whole different thing?

40:11.917 --> 40:13.083
This?

40:13.083 --> 40:15.291
Us.

40:15.291 --> 40:17.250
Look,
I'm a restless person.

40:17.250 --> 40:19.041
I'm never happy
unless I'm in motion

40:19.041 --> 40:21.834
or running seven projects
simultaneously.

40:21.834 --> 40:23.625
But last night
I was here.

40:25.667 --> 40:26.708
Even right now.

40:26.708 --> 40:31.208
I haven't stayed in bed
past 5 a.m. since 2001.

40:31.208 --> 40:35.542
Yet right now I feel still,
and I like it.

40:37.041 --> 40:40.959
And... since I'm here...

40:43.000 --> 40:44.458
Hold up.

40:45.917 --> 40:50.125
I'm glad you found
another dimension

40:50.125 --> 40:52.375
you can exist in.

40:52.375 --> 40:55.291
But at the moment,

40:55.291 --> 40:57.875
the present is
all I can really handle.

41:00.792 --> 41:04.000
And the light of day is a little
bright for me right now.

41:06.125 --> 41:06.708
Okay.

41:06.708 --> 41:08.458
I got an early meeting.

41:08.458 --> 41:10.041
Mind if I take
the first shower?

41:10.041 --> 41:11.583
All yours.

41:20.125 --> 41:22.166
Kids ready for camp?

41:22.166 --> 41:24.083
They're brushing
their teeth.

41:24.083 --> 41:27.625
Did I just see, uh,
the sitter getting into a taxi?

41:27.625 --> 41:31.250
Why would she be here
in the morning?

41:35.208 --> 41:38.625
You know, I had a craving

41:38.625 --> 41:41.917
for a boudin noir
last night,

41:41.917 --> 41:43.583
so I went to
Bistro Grisby.

41:43.583 --> 41:46.166
We used to go there
all the time.

41:46.166 --> 41:49.000
Yeah, when we were
first married.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.458
Not in a long time.

41:53.375 --> 41:54.583
Now it's gone.

41:54.583 --> 41:56.458
Gone?

41:56.458 --> 42:00.208
It's, uh,
a nail salon now.

42:00.208 --> 42:02.500
They closed
four years ago.

42:02.500 --> 42:03.792
Sad.

42:03.792 --> 42:05.041
Mm.

42:10.500 --> 42:12.250
Look...

42:12.250 --> 42:16.000
I know
that I reacted poorly

42:16.000 --> 42:20.000
when I learned that you were
going back to Axe Capital.

42:20.000 --> 42:23.792
I'm sorry.

42:23.792 --> 42:26.166
I was being selfish.

42:29.542 --> 42:30.625
If you are happy there,

42:30.625 --> 42:36.291
then... that's where
you should be.

42:40.041 --> 42:42.583
I want you to be happy.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.041
That's lovely, Chuck.

42:55.291 --> 42:56.959
It really is.

42:59.875 --> 43:02.500
I'll go get the kids.

43:13.125 --> 43:15.834
Boss...

43:15.834 --> 43:18.500
I received
a concerning bit of news.

43:18.500 --> 43:20.000
Mick Danzig just quit.

43:21.375 --> 43:23.041
Is that so?

43:23.041 --> 43:24.417
I just never thought
I'd have an issue

43:24.417 --> 43:27.000
dating someone
in the office.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.834
And I really didn't.

43:29.834 --> 43:31.083
I don't know...

43:31.083 --> 43:34.875
it's just distracting
with Everett here.

43:34.875 --> 43:37.291
I see the way
she looks at him, and --

43:39.625 --> 43:41.917
We are in
the middle of a session.

43:41.917 --> 43:43.208
Mafee, out.

43:43.208 --> 43:46.542
Yeah, we were just shooting
the breeze, catching up.

43:46.542 --> 43:48.959
That was completely
inappropriate.

43:48.959 --> 43:50.208
How can I possibly do my job
if your guys

43:50.208 --> 43:53.959
think you might come barging
through the door at any moment?

43:53.959 --> 43:55.959
It takes me long enough
to convince them

43:55.959 --> 43:57.625
you don't have
my office bugged.

43:57.625 --> 44:00.208
Once you realized you
couldn't influence my thinking,

44:00.208 --> 44:02.125
you decided to influence
someone else's?

44:02.125 --> 44:03.375
-That's my job.
-For the good of the firm,

44:03.375 --> 44:04.792
which I do not define

44:04.792 --> 44:06.708
as making one
of my best earners quit.

44:06.708 --> 44:09.625
I didn't make anyone
do anything.

44:09.625 --> 44:11.750
I know you had a session
with Mick Danzig.

44:11.750 --> 44:13.000
What did you say to him?

44:13.000 --> 44:14.250
I can't discuss that.

44:14.250 --> 44:16.959
You contract here
is very clear.

44:16.959 --> 44:18.291
You are here to help
my employees perform

44:18.291 --> 44:20.750
at their peak level.

44:20.750 --> 44:23.417
In any manner I see fit.
You don't like it, fire me.

44:23.417 --> 44:25.208
Pay me out.
I agreed to come back.

44:25.208 --> 44:27.500
I am back doing exactly
what I am paid to do.

44:27.500 --> 44:29.458
You made the deal, Bobby.

44:29.458 --> 44:31.250
You can get out
of it any time.

44:44.083 --> 44:47.041
That was a neat trick
you pulled with the A.G.

44:47.041 --> 44:49.875
I mean, I've never
seen her flanked before.

44:49.875 --> 44:51.166
Impressive.

44:51.166 --> 44:54.625
All in the service
of justice.

44:54.625 --> 44:56.834
Well,
and the Southern District.

44:56.834 --> 44:57.750
Mm.

44:57.750 --> 44:59.834
Now you get to have
your moment...

44:59.834 --> 45:02.625
as well you should.

45:02.625 --> 45:07.083
The question is,
what will you do with it?

45:07.083 --> 45:09.375
Such ambitions are far
from my focus.

45:09.375 --> 45:12.208
I see a run for office.

45:14.083 --> 45:17.166
Is it possible
you'll go the other way?

45:17.166 --> 45:19.041
Cash out, go private?
That's not you.

45:19.041 --> 45:23.375
No. Sadly, I'm like you.
Public servant for life.

45:23.375 --> 45:27.667
Uh, and it's in that
role that I'm here.

45:27.667 --> 45:28.959
I have come across

45:28.959 --> 45:32.166
a wonderful young law student,
Emma Foley.

45:32.166 --> 45:34.959
She's at Cardoza.
Smart. Studious.

45:34.959 --> 45:37.875
And a clerkship with
you would, uh --

45:37.875 --> 45:40.375
Oh, slice that baby up.

45:40.375 --> 45:41.834
Thank you.

45:41.834 --> 45:46.083
Oh, I love the sound
it makes when they carve it.

45:46.083 --> 45:47.208
There you go.

45:47.208 --> 45:49.166
Uh. All right.

45:50.166 --> 45:51.667
That crackle.

45:52.834 --> 45:55.667
Look, if this young lady
is qualified,

45:55.667 --> 45:58.000
I'll consider her
as I would any other candidate.

45:58.000 --> 45:59.917
I recognize the last name.

45:59.917 --> 46:02.708
So I have a feeling if she were
really as super as you say,

46:02.708 --> 46:04.500
she'd already have
a clerkship.

46:04.500 --> 46:06.583
Well, we're not talking
about appointing her

46:06.583 --> 46:07.834
to the Supreme Court.

46:07.834 --> 46:10.625
This is how things
are done, right?

46:10.625 --> 46:14.041
Not for me.
Not anymore.

46:14.041 --> 46:15.166
I look at the way
things get done.

46:15.166 --> 46:19.208
The view changes when you
see things from the bench.

46:19.208 --> 46:20.417
Uh-huh.

46:20.417 --> 46:23.125
Favor-trading, deal-making,

46:23.125 --> 46:26.125
back channeling, patronage.

46:26.125 --> 46:28.667
I'll admit, I took advantage
every now and then

46:28.667 --> 46:30.708
when I was in the trenches.

46:30.708 --> 46:33.417
But...I lost my taste for it.

46:33.417 --> 46:36.458
True objectivity.

46:36.458 --> 46:37.458
It's the ultimate luxury.

46:37.458 --> 46:39.125
It's corrosive, Chuck.

46:39.125 --> 46:42.500
I mean, I went to law school
to help fix the system,

46:42.500 --> 46:43.834
not succumb to it.

46:43.834 --> 46:45.959
Sounds like you're feeling
the holy spirit.

46:45.959 --> 46:49.667
For the first time
since clerking for RBG.

46:49.667 --> 46:52.959
Which is why I'm careful
with my own clerks.

46:52.959 --> 46:54.083
This is very  personal
for me.

46:54.083 --> 46:57.375
I mean, I'm finally
in a position to do some good.

46:57.375 --> 46:58.834
Very inspiring.

46:58.834 --> 47:00.542
Just don't forget,

47:00.542 --> 47:02.500
it was the back channels
and deal-making

47:02.500 --> 47:05.458
that put you
in that position.

47:05.458 --> 47:08.542
Remind me again, and this is
the last meal we share.

47:10.458 --> 47:12.041
Help yourself.

47:12.041 --> 47:13.542
Absolutely right.

47:15.417 --> 47:17.792
Thank you.

47:17.792 --> 47:21.166
I think you'll make
an excellent candidate, Chuck.

47:21.166 --> 47:25.417
I actually think you're built
for the political life.

47:25.417 --> 47:28.500
I mean, if I'm you,
I'd go for it.

47:28.500 --> 47:31.041
Mm.

47:33.875 --> 47:36.375
It wasn't the Governor
who called the shot.

47:36.375 --> 47:37.750
Sure, he controls Scolari.

47:37.750 --> 47:39.708
But this goes to who
controls the Governor,

47:39.708 --> 47:41.166
and that's Jack Foley.

47:41.166 --> 47:43.875
I know who that is --
old steel and railroad money.

47:43.875 --> 47:45.834
One of the first
Western businessmen

47:45.834 --> 47:47.083
into Russia
after the wall fell.

47:47.083 --> 47:50.458
But more than that,
an Albany machine man.

47:50.458 --> 47:52.500
His family goes all
the way back to Tweed.

47:52.500 --> 47:53.250
Huh.

47:53.250 --> 47:54.917
Foley's war chest
got three

47:54.917 --> 47:56.583
of the last four Govs
elected,

47:56.583 --> 47:57.792
along with half
the Assembly.

47:57.792 --> 48:00.041
But it seems, in this case,
he focused on the casino.

48:00.041 --> 48:03.083
So, why would Foley
want to fuck me?

48:03.083 --> 48:06.375
Unclear. Look, it's like
that Marco kid said,

48:06.375 --> 48:08.250
this likely wasn't
a targeted strike.

48:08.250 --> 48:10.000
It was collateral on a strike
against someone else.

48:10.000 --> 48:13.625
It may actually be random
Albany bullshit.

48:13.625 --> 48:15.250
But we can't be
sure it wasn't.

48:15.250 --> 48:16.125
No, we can't.

48:24.792 --> 48:26.625
I'm Tier two, which means
I can sign out

48:26.625 --> 48:28.166
during the day
to look for a job.

48:28.166 --> 48:30.250
But I don't want to talk
about this place.

48:30.250 --> 48:31.166
I want to hear
about the world.

48:32.625 --> 48:35.667
Well...

48:35.667 --> 48:38.458
I'm having problems
with that bond I bought upstate.

48:38.458 --> 48:40.959
I saw.

48:40.959 --> 48:43.250
Albany moved
the gaming license.

48:43.250 --> 48:44.625
You trying to get it back?

48:44.625 --> 48:48.125
It's too late.
I have to take action.

48:48.125 --> 48:51.166
The only way that I can
come out ahead,

48:51.166 --> 48:52.125
it's pretty grisly.

48:54.750 --> 48:58.583
Playing Torquemada's
never fun.

49:07.708 --> 49:10.959
I'm still stuck on how the whole
license thing went down.

49:10.959 --> 49:13.291
It was supposed
to be a done deal.

49:13.291 --> 49:17.125
But the switch...
it tracks back to Jack Foley.

49:17.125 --> 49:19.792
What do you want to know
about Black Jack?

49:19.792 --> 49:21.583
What drives him.
What moves him.

49:21.583 --> 49:24.250
Who he's close to.

49:24.250 --> 49:26.417
How I can get close to him.

49:26.417 --> 49:29.125
He's driven
by maintaining influence...

49:29.125 --> 49:30.000
naturally...

49:30.000 --> 49:33.417
and growing his
six-generation fortune

49:33.417 --> 49:35.834
and staying invisible
despite it all.

49:35.834 --> 49:38.625
Advisor to kings
and princes.

49:38.625 --> 49:39.583
There was a time
not long ago

49:39.583 --> 49:41.083
I could have put you
in a room with him.

49:41.083 --> 49:45.667
But I'm off
his speed dial now.

49:45.667 --> 49:47.417
All the way off.

49:49.083 --> 49:50.000
Roberto...

49:50.000 --> 49:53.208
what you're
considering upstate,

49:53.208 --> 49:57.000
the vulture play,
know this...

49:57.000 --> 49:58.458
everybody's a Libertarian

49:58.458 --> 50:00.458
until it's their town
that's dying.

50:00.458 --> 50:03.708
Then a bailout
only seems right.

50:03.708 --> 50:05.291
Before I ended up in here,

50:05.291 --> 50:07.834
I would've said to you,

50:07.834 --> 50:09.125
"Let it implode.
Raze the fucker.

50:09.125 --> 50:12.583
Let something new
grow in its place.

50:12.583 --> 50:14.375
Prop it up and you're
only delaying

50:14.375 --> 50:15.875
the inevitable collapse."

50:15.875 --> 50:17.166
But now?

50:17.166 --> 50:18.834
You have to
handle it right,

50:18.834 --> 50:21.333
or you'll be facing the same
torches and pitchforks

50:21.333 --> 50:22.583
that landed me in here.

50:22.583 --> 50:24.917
Except that what I'd be
doing isn't illegal.

50:27.166 --> 50:28.208
I did everything I could

50:28.208 --> 50:30.708
to make sure
it didn't come to this.

50:30.708 --> 50:32.708
But still it went bad.

50:34.667 --> 50:37.667
Just don't forget...

50:37.667 --> 50:39.333
if they hate you enough,

50:39.333 --> 50:42.166
they will find legal
grounds to fuck you.

50:42.166 --> 50:43.250
You know this.

50:50.375 --> 50:54.208
You're not gonna be able
to find out what I need to know.

50:54.208 --> 50:55.708
I'm gonna have to sit
down face-to-face with Foley.

50:55.708 --> 50:58.667
He'll be resistant.

50:58.667 --> 51:01.834
So start thinking of ways
to overcome that resistance.

51:01.834 --> 51:03.208
Will do.

51:13.583 --> 51:14.250
Yeah.

51:15.750 --> 51:17.750
No, I wasn't.

51:17.750 --> 51:19.417
But send him up.

51:35.417 --> 51:37.750
I understand what "vulture"
means now, huh.

51:39.542 --> 51:42.583
I know things didn't work out
the way we thought they would.

51:42.583 --> 51:44.125
And I know this is
a bad situation for you.

51:44.125 --> 51:46.583
But I got to ask you
to please

51:46.583 --> 51:49.750
not take it out
on Marco's town.

51:49.750 --> 51:51.417
You know you've got
a finder's fee

51:51.417 --> 51:52.834
coming to you either way.

51:52.834 --> 51:54.750
Come on, I don't give
a shit about that.

51:54.750 --> 51:57.333
You can throw it right in
if it changes anything.

51:57.333 --> 51:59.417
Bobby, I've known you
since you're a kid.

51:59.417 --> 52:02.041
I don't know why you want
to hurt all of these people

52:02.041 --> 52:04.041
who got
so little as it is.

52:04.041 --> 52:07.250
These people, they're just
like you while growing up.

52:07.250 --> 52:09.208
Now you've got everything.

52:09.208 --> 52:11.792
They're gonna have
less than nothing.

52:11.792 --> 52:14.875
I can't have that on my head,
and you don't want it on yours.

52:14.875 --> 52:17.125
I hear you, Bruno.

52:17.125 --> 52:19.583
Like you said, you've known me
since I was a kid,

52:19.583 --> 52:21.417
so you know I'm telling you
the truth

52:21.417 --> 52:25.458
when I say
I want to avoid doing it.

52:25.458 --> 52:27.583
I'm trying my best.

53:22.208 --> 53:24.375
I saw Bruno down there.

53:24.375 --> 53:26.000
He was here
about the muni bond?

53:26.000 --> 53:28.542
Lobbying for Sandicot.

53:33.417 --> 53:34.542
What do you think
I should do?

53:36.375 --> 53:40.208
You finally asking me
for my opinion?

53:40.208 --> 53:41.834
I wasn't cutting you out.

53:44.291 --> 53:46.834
I'm just trying to wrap
my head around all this.

53:46.834 --> 53:49.125
But now I really need
to know what you think.

53:53.333 --> 53:56.625
I can see how painful
this is for you.

53:56.625 --> 53:59.417
It was all over your face
when you were talking to Bruno.

54:03.500 --> 54:06.542
It's tough.

54:06.542 --> 54:08.875
I just sank a shit ton of money
into a place

54:08.875 --> 54:11.750
that will never be able
to repay its obligations.

54:13.542 --> 54:16.542
But if we go soft,
like Bruno wants us to,

54:16.542 --> 54:19.708
we'll lose the better part
of 500 million dollars.

54:21.834 --> 54:26.917
Whereas if we do what it takes
to make the bond viable,

54:26.917 --> 54:29.291
we're gonna clear over
$100 million.

54:31.667 --> 54:35.375
I can see both sides
of this.

54:35.375 --> 54:36.959
Those people up there are
who we used to be.

54:36.959 --> 54:40.125
That's what Bruno said.

54:43.000 --> 54:46.750
Did anyone ever help us,
or look out for us?

54:47.625 --> 54:50.125
When my mother was
closing the blinds

54:50.125 --> 54:53.000
so that bill collectors wouldn't
know that anyone was home?

54:53.000 --> 54:54.208
No.

54:54.208 --> 54:57.708
The way we were brought up,
it was always them or us.

54:57.708 --> 54:59.000
And it still is.

54:59.000 --> 55:03.250
That's what I think.

55:03.250 --> 55:06.208
And like you said,
Bobby...

55:06.208 --> 55:09.125
in the end,
everyone else is cannon fodder.

55:09.125 --> 55:12.959
So I say you go up there,
and you do what you got to do.

55:12.959 --> 55:14.917
Cut off
the gangrenous parts.

55:14.917 --> 55:17.583
And then we go in with
charter schools and outrage,

55:17.583 --> 55:18.959
for about $30 million.

55:18.959 --> 55:20.250
We capture
the tax write-off,

55:20.250 --> 55:22.333
and those kids
will be better off

55:22.333 --> 55:24.750
than their parents,
or we, ever were.
