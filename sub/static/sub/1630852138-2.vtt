02:31.040 --> 02:33.160
Where do you go to school?

02:34.440 --> 02:35.960
We don't have a school.

02:36.920 --> 02:38.720
My grandmother teaches me.

02:41.920 --> 02:43.400
Why did you come here?

02:46.240 --> 02:50.320
My mom and dad have been
so stressed out lately, so…

02:51.640 --> 02:55.440
So I think they wanted
to celebrate Christmas where…

02:56.880 --> 02:59.080
-You know…
-Where nothing happens.

03:00.040 --> 03:01.120
No.

03:01.760 --> 03:04.720
No, that's not…
You have all kinds of stuff going on.

03:05.960 --> 03:08.440
You've got the harbor, and…

03:09.480 --> 03:11.480
the forest, and…

03:22.560 --> 03:23.520
Look.

03:25.240 --> 03:28.120
The sky and the ocean,
you can't tell where they meet.

03:30.400 --> 03:32.000
It's so beautiful.

03:37.400 --> 03:38.560
You can't see it, right?

03:39.960 --> 03:41.080
Yes, I can…

03:41.920 --> 03:44.600
It's… really cool.

04:00.880 --> 04:01.840
I have to go.

04:02.600 --> 04:03.680
I have to go home.

04:04.560 --> 04:05.400
Now?

04:05.480 --> 04:07.400
This isn't a good idea, okay?

04:08.040 --> 04:09.040
Liv, wait!

04:09.120 --> 04:10.680
You shouldn't have come here.

04:21.880 --> 04:23.560
They're fleeing the forest.

04:24.800 --> 04:25.840
Yes.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.560
Something is wrong in there.

04:29.680 --> 04:31.480
We have to sacrifice one more.

04:36.000 --> 04:36.840
Yes.

04:38.040 --> 04:38.880
Anders?

04:42.200 --> 04:44.080
Take her and put her on the truck.

04:44.160 --> 04:46.080
No. Not Dina.

04:46.160 --> 04:48.560
Don't name them. They're food.

04:51.040 --> 04:54.400
-We just went for a walk. That's it.
-Tell me how it went.

04:54.480 --> 04:55.720
-Was it nice?
-What?

04:56.520 --> 04:59.960
-Like with tongues and stuff?
-No, honey, that's too much.

05:00.040 --> 05:02.400
-Stop it!
-Good morning, sweetie.

05:02.480 --> 05:04.200
-Good morning.
-Grab some breakfast.

05:04.880 --> 05:05.920
Did you sleep okay?

05:07.520 --> 05:09.800
We're talking about
Kasper's date this morning.

05:09.880 --> 05:12.040
-Stop it.
-It didn't go so well.

05:13.800 --> 05:15.200
What happened to your hand?

05:17.120 --> 05:18.120
Nothing.

05:18.880 --> 05:20.600
Let me see it. What happened?

05:23.400 --> 05:25.280
I scratched it on a window.

05:25.880 --> 05:26.920
On a window?

05:27.000 --> 05:29.560
-On a nail.
-In your room?

05:30.360 --> 05:31.760
What were you doing?

05:31.840 --> 05:33.920
It's okay now. I'm okay.

05:35.240 --> 05:38.280
Honey, would you check
Josefine's room later?

05:38.360 --> 05:39.800
Sure. Let me see the scratch.

05:40.320 --> 05:43.080
It's fine. It's nothing.
You don't have to.

05:43.160 --> 05:45.600
Sure, but get her a Band-Aid, okay?

05:46.120 --> 05:48.480
-It may sting a little.
-Poor you.

05:50.880 --> 05:52.120
There you go.

05:52.640 --> 05:57.080
Kids, listen up.
We got off to a rough start yesterday.

05:57.600 --> 06:00.200
So Dad and I talked about
going for a drive to find

06:00.280 --> 06:02.320
a Christmas tree, together, as a family.

06:02.400 --> 06:03.560
-Just like that?
-Yes.

06:03.640 --> 06:04.680
Okay.

06:05.320 --> 06:06.320
When?

06:07.080 --> 06:08.440
As soon as we've eaten.

06:09.800 --> 06:14.480
I was wondering
if I could just stay here and read.

06:14.560 --> 06:18.560
You tell me to read for 20 minutes
every day, even on holidays.

06:19.080 --> 06:19.920
Right?

06:20.520 --> 06:21.360
Right.

06:21.840 --> 06:25.240
Sure, Jose,
but this really won't take very long--

06:25.320 --> 06:26.320
It's a good idea.

06:27.400 --> 06:30.480
Josefine will stay here to read,
and we'll find a Christmas tree.

06:31.280 --> 06:34.040
We did say how this was a family vacation.

06:34.120 --> 06:37.080
Mom means it's great to see
you take your reading seriously.

06:37.160 --> 06:40.800
And if you think your vacation
is best spent reading a book,

06:40.880 --> 06:44.520
then we're sure you're old enough
to be left on your own.

06:45.040 --> 06:47.080
If she's not going, I'm not going!

06:47.720 --> 06:48.960
-You're going.
-You're going.

07:33.680 --> 07:34.680
Are you there?

08:01.200 --> 08:02.640
I just want to help you.

08:08.480 --> 08:09.760
I won't hurt you.

08:16.840 --> 08:17.800
Where are you?

08:22.760 --> 08:23.760
There you are.

08:24.280 --> 08:25.320
Hi.

08:31.320 --> 08:32.920
I've got some food for you.

08:35.480 --> 08:36.680
It's an apple.

09:06.160 --> 09:07.760
I've got something else too.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.120
It's bacon.

09:57.520 --> 09:58.720
So, what are you?

10:08.560 --> 10:10.360
Come on. Come with me.

10:22.400 --> 10:24.160
-Anders?
-Yes?

10:25.240 --> 10:28.240
-Go ahead. I need to do something.
-I can't go alone.

10:28.320 --> 10:29.880
You can. You've done it before.

10:29.960 --> 10:31.000
But never alone.

10:32.960 --> 10:35.560
Quickly in and out.
Then they won't hurt you.

10:37.240 --> 10:38.440
-Okay?
-Yes.

11:02.480 --> 11:04.480
Careful.
You'll scratch the sunroof, Kasper.

11:04.560 --> 11:07.120
It's way too big. No, Dad. Fuck!

11:07.200 --> 11:08.880
Honey, you hit his face.

11:08.960 --> 11:12.240
It's perfect. It'll fit in the cottage.
And look at that trunk!

11:12.320 --> 11:14.400
Thick enough to carry Fat Claus.

11:14.480 --> 11:16.240
It's disgusting, Dad.

11:16.320 --> 11:17.840
-It's not disgusting.
-Just a bit?

11:17.920 --> 11:19.640
It needs to go on the tree.

11:19.720 --> 11:23.640
Fat Claus always goes on the tree.
This year is no exception.

11:23.720 --> 11:25.720
-Then we're all agreed.
-Honey.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.120
Hi.

11:32.960 --> 11:34.120
Getting some fresh air?

11:34.200 --> 11:35.360
Sure, it's…

11:35.880 --> 11:37.160
so beautiful here.

11:39.720 --> 11:41.400
And you got yourselves a tree.

11:43.680 --> 11:45.280
Yes, it…

11:46.280 --> 11:47.440
We found it.

11:47.520 --> 11:51.080
It was in a ditch over there,
so we just lifted it out.

11:53.600 --> 11:55.240
This is my husband, Mads.

11:55.320 --> 11:57.600
-And our son, Kasper.
-Nice to meet you.

11:57.680 --> 11:58.920
-Hi.
-Hi.

12:08.920 --> 12:11.760
Årmandsø is a nature reserve.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.960
-I did mention that to you.
-Yes.

12:16.480 --> 12:17.800
That's what I thought.

12:22.640 --> 12:25.640
I told you. Don't laugh. It's not funny.

12:25.720 --> 12:28.640
-Stop it.
-Here we are, wrecking their nature.

12:28.720 --> 12:31.360
Doesn't matter if we felled a tree
or it fell into a ditch, right?

12:41.240 --> 12:42.440
Don't be scared.

12:44.640 --> 12:46.480
I just want to put this on you.

12:47.520 --> 12:48.560
It's a…

12:49.520 --> 12:50.520
Band-Aid.

12:51.840 --> 12:53.360
To go on your leg.

12:54.680 --> 12:55.720
Look.

12:56.360 --> 12:57.400
I have one too.

13:00.840 --> 13:02.240
Yes. Come on.

13:04.840 --> 13:06.120
My name's Josefine.

13:07.480 --> 13:08.400
What's your name?

13:14.760 --> 13:15.960
Do you speak?

13:22.560 --> 13:23.480
Yes.

13:25.040 --> 13:26.360
Josefine.

13:29.520 --> 13:30.880
-Wait.
-Jose, are you there?

13:32.520 --> 13:33.560
Jose?

13:37.080 --> 13:39.920
What are you doing in here?
Mom and Dad told you not to.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.280
-I'm just doing something.
-We're looking for you. Come on down.

13:44.160 --> 13:46.200
I'm not decorating
that stupid tree on my own.

13:47.120 --> 13:48.760
Hurry up, loser.

13:50.040 --> 13:51.520
Man, it's creepy in here.

13:53.520 --> 13:55.680
-What the hell are you doing?
-Nothing.

13:56.480 --> 13:58.080
Butt out, Kasper.

14:01.960 --> 14:02.880
Fuck!

14:02.960 --> 14:03.960
Look up there!

14:06.120 --> 14:07.120
It's probably a rat.

14:08.720 --> 14:09.840
It's not a rat.

14:10.680 --> 14:11.560
What?

14:11.640 --> 14:13.160
We hit it with the car.

14:14.600 --> 14:18.080
I went back to the forest last night.
It's hurt.

14:18.160 --> 14:20.360
-I want to help--
-Did you bring back a rat?

14:20.440 --> 14:23.600
-Don't say anything.
-We're not allowed in here.

14:23.680 --> 14:26.040
-Let's go.
-No, I have to help it.

14:26.120 --> 14:28.560
-No, you're not helping.
-That's not up to you.

14:29.600 --> 14:31.440
I'll get Dad. He'll get rid of it.

14:34.120 --> 14:35.200
Kasper, wait!

14:35.800 --> 14:36.760
Kasper.

14:37.360 --> 14:39.640
-It needs help.
-It's not our job.

14:39.720 --> 14:40.760
Yes, it is!

14:41.640 --> 14:42.960
We hit it.

14:43.040 --> 14:44.160
We have to help it.

14:44.680 --> 14:46.840
It only happened because we were arguing<i>.</i>

14:47.800 --> 14:49.720
Talk to Mom and Dad about it.

14:49.800 --> 14:50.800
No!

14:50.880 --> 14:53.400
She thinks I'm a baby
who can't do anything.

14:53.480 --> 14:54.600
Jose?

14:55.200 --> 14:57.080
-Come on, Kasper.
-Kasper!

15:02.120 --> 15:03.160
Where were you?

15:03.760 --> 15:05.440
Are you still in your pajamas?

15:07.200 --> 15:08.680
It…

15:09.280 --> 15:10.440
Kasper?

15:16.240 --> 15:17.960
Jose is just being a pain in the ass.

15:19.320 --> 15:20.400
Nothing new.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.080
Okay. Come on.

15:23.600 --> 15:25.080
We're decorating the tree.

15:25.600 --> 15:26.640
You're ice cold.

15:26.720 --> 15:27.920
Be nice to your sister.

15:30.960 --> 15:32.160
That looks nice.

15:38.800 --> 15:41.040
He's handsome, right? Fat Claus.

15:41.120 --> 15:42.400
You'll go here.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.120
So…

15:53.240 --> 15:55.080
-Do you want more?
-Yes.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.760
You're doing a great job.

15:59.680 --> 16:00.560
A relative?

16:00.640 --> 16:03.360
None of us dare say
you're beginning to look like him,

16:03.440 --> 16:04.640
but you are.

16:19.800 --> 16:21.000
Where are you going?

16:22.600 --> 16:23.840
Don't go without me.

16:26.440 --> 16:29.880
I literally just covered for you.
I want to see what it is.

16:32.600 --> 16:35.480
Or I could tattle.
Do you think they'd let you keep it?

16:36.000 --> 16:37.760
-You're such a shit.
-So are you.

16:37.840 --> 16:39.800
-You're a bigger shit.
-Hey, kids?

16:40.400 --> 16:42.360
Everything okay? Aren't you coming in?

16:42.440 --> 16:44.640
-We're coming.
-I made hash brownies.

16:44.720 --> 16:45.960
You're so funny.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.200
If you're coming,
you have to do exactly what I say.

16:53.720 --> 16:55.960
-Shut up.
-No, I mean it.

16:57.320 --> 16:58.560
We're going for a walk.

17:08.800 --> 17:09.840
Are you coming?

17:11.360 --> 17:12.480
Are you scared?

17:18.160 --> 17:19.200
Where are you?

17:19.960 --> 17:21.160
Jose, be careful!

17:35.480 --> 17:36.680
You're feeling bad, huh?

17:38.760 --> 17:39.760
Easy now.

17:44.920 --> 17:46.080
I won't hurt you.

17:46.160 --> 17:47.160
There you go.

17:47.760 --> 17:48.640
Good job.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.120
Easy now.

17:53.360 --> 17:54.880
What the hell is that?

17:57.320 --> 17:59.120
There you go.

18:00.440 --> 18:01.440
It's okay.

18:02.560 --> 18:06.160
I'm not going to hurt you,
but I have to fix your leg.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.240
Would you cut a piece off?

18:13.640 --> 18:14.840
Kasper.

18:24.640 --> 18:26.360
We'd better clean it first.

18:28.880 --> 18:29.920
Don't worry.

18:34.440 --> 18:36.080
It's okay.

18:38.560 --> 18:39.960
I'm cleaning it now.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
Don't worry.

18:49.240 --> 18:50.680
Man, it's ugly.

18:52.200 --> 18:53.080
You're ugly.

18:59.080 --> 19:01.600
Maybe it needs something for the pain.

19:02.640 --> 19:03.760
It's okay.

19:13.160 --> 19:14.360
It's your turn now.

19:17.840 --> 19:19.040
You'll be okay.

19:46.720 --> 19:49.600
-Careful, it might bite.
-Why would it bite me?

19:50.200 --> 19:52.200
-Relax.
-I'm serious.

19:52.840 --> 19:55.480
-You don't know what it is.
-You promised to help me.

19:56.720 --> 19:58.400
They need their child back.

20:06.320 --> 20:07.200
Anders!

20:16.600 --> 20:18.000
Anders, it's Møller.

20:18.640 --> 20:19.520
Yes.

20:19.600 --> 20:21.440
<i>-Are you still in there?</i>
-Yes, but…

20:21.520 --> 20:24.680
-<i>I'm almost out now.</i>
<i>-</i>Get out. Listen to me!

20:24.760 --> 20:26.160
I'm almost out.

20:26.680 --> 20:30.160
<i>One of the babies got out.</i>
<i>You need to get out. Now!</i>

20:37.200 --> 20:38.920
Møller, I can hear them.

20:39.680 --> 20:41.680
<i>You need to get out. Run!</i>

20:42.280 --> 20:44.280
<i>Møller, hurry up! They're coming!</i>

20:44.360 --> 20:45.480
Shit!

20:58.120 --> 21:00.960
<i>Anders? Anders, are you there? Come in!</i>

21:03.800 --> 21:04.960
<i>Anders, answer me!</i>

21:05.040 --> 21:06.040
Anders!

21:18.000 --> 21:19.200
Anders!
