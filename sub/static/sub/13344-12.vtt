WEBVTT

00:05.606 --> 00:07.975
Male voice:
PREVIOUSLY ON
"IN TREATMENT"...

00:08.076 --> 00:09.910
LET'S JUST CUT
TO THE CHASE, OKAY?

00:10.010 --> 00:13.314
SATURDAY MORNING
I'M STANDING IN THE STREET
NEAR THE BOMB SITE.

00:13.414 --> 00:15.983
LOOKS LIKE LONDON
AFTER THE BLITZ--
JUST RUBBLE.

00:16.084 --> 00:17.718
AND ALL BECAUSE
OF WHAT I DID.

00:17.818 --> 00:20.388
I KNEW THIS SHOULD'VE BEEN
THE TRAUMA OF MY LIFE,

00:20.488 --> 00:21.855
BUT I FELT...

00:21.955 --> 00:23.691
NOTHING.

00:23.791 --> 00:27.328
THIS OLD MAN CAME OVER TO ME
AND I LOOKED IN HIS EYES

00:27.428 --> 00:31.031
AND THEY WERE
SORT OF AMUSED,
KIND OF FRIENDLY.

00:31.132 --> 00:33.901
THE WAY MY FATHER
LOOKS AT ME WHEN HE THINKS
I'VE DONE SOMETHING WRONG.

00:34.001 --> 00:36.837
YOU STILL THINK
IT'S TOO EARLY TO TALK
ABOUT YOUR FATHER?

00:36.937 --> 00:39.373
WHEN A PERSON DECIDES
HE'S NOT IN LOVE
WITH HIS SPOUSE,

00:39.473 --> 00:42.443
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO
PUT OFF LEAVING HOME.
ISN'T THAT SO?

00:42.543 --> 00:44.112
DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S
A LITTLE EXTREME?

00:44.212 --> 00:47.715
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
- LAURA.

00:53.821 --> 00:55.656
HEY.

00:55.756 --> 00:58.526
THIS IS FOR YOU.

01:00.128 --> 01:01.462
WHAT IS IT?

01:01.562 --> 01:04.232
AN ESPRESSO MACHINE--
THE PASQUINI LIVIA.

01:04.332 --> 01:05.966
( chuckles )
TOP OF THE LINE.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.068
FOR ME?

01:08.169 --> 01:12.106
AH. WITH A
THREE-YEAR WARRANTY.

01:12.206 --> 01:15.843
IS THIS SOME KIND
OF HINT ABOUT THE COFFEE
YOU HAD HERE LAST WEEK?

01:15.943 --> 01:19.213
OH, NO HINT.
IT'S A STATEMENT.

01:20.047 --> 01:21.782
( knife slices )

01:21.882 --> 01:23.851
( theme music playing )

01:40.168 --> 01:42.470
CHECK THIS OUT.

01:47.775 --> 01:50.077
SEE, YOUR COFFEE...

01:50.178 --> 01:52.012
WAS HORRIFYING.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.182
NOW I DON'T WANT
TO HURT YOUR FEELINGS.

01:54.282 --> 01:57.251
I WON'T TELL YOU
THE TRUTH ABOUT YOUR COFFEE
AND WHAT IT SAYS ABOUT YOU.

01:57.351 --> 02:00.120
- WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUT ME?
- I MAY TELL YOU LATER.

02:00.221 --> 02:02.156
SO HOW DO YOU LIKE
YOUR COFFEE MACHINE?

02:02.256 --> 02:04.858
IT'S, UH, REALLY NICE.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.695
BUT I, UM--
I CAN'T ACCEPT IT.

02:07.795 --> 02:08.962
I'M-- I'M SORRY.

02:09.062 --> 02:10.764
WHAT, ARE YOU
A GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE?

02:10.864 --> 02:14.302
HEY, I GOT THIS
FOR AN AMAZING PRICE
IN AN AUCTION.

02:14.402 --> 02:16.170
- IN A WHAT?
- AN AUCTION

02:16.270 --> 02:18.005
ON THE INTERNET-- EBAY.

02:18.105 --> 02:20.441
SEE, I PICK THE TIMES
WHEN THE WHOLE COUNTRY'S
GLUED TO THE TELEVISION.

02:20.541 --> 02:23.076
- ( espresso machine whirring )
- PRICES DROP 70%, 80%.

02:23.177 --> 02:26.113
LIKE DURING
THE SUPER BOWL.

02:26.214 --> 02:28.282
GOT MYSELF
A HOME ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM,

02:28.382 --> 02:31.118
EIGHT SPEAKERS
AND A RECEIVER
FOR ONLY $1,000.

02:31.219 --> 02:33.153
WOULD'VE COST
$4,500 RETAIL.

02:33.254 --> 02:38.091
ANYWAY, THURSDAY WAS
THE "AMERICAN IDOL" FINALE...

02:38.192 --> 02:39.660
- AND I THOUGHT OF YOU.
- OH.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.595
SO I WENT ONLINE
AND GRABBED THIS.

02:41.695 --> 02:43.897
COULD YOU TURN
THAT OFF, ALEX, PLEASE?

02:45.098 --> 02:47.134
WHAT?

02:47.235 --> 02:50.504
JUST SWITCH
IT OFF, PLEASE.

02:54.608 --> 02:56.477
OKAY, WHAT ARE YOU
AFRAID OF?

02:56.577 --> 02:58.746
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
IT'S A COFFEE MACHINE.

03:00.381 --> 03:03.384
( sighs )
LOOK, I THINK
IT'S A REALLY

03:03.484 --> 03:05.486
SWEET GESTURE,
AND I-- I THANK YOU.

03:05.586 --> 03:08.055
DON'T YOU WANT
TO UPGRADE THE STANDARD
OF LIVING AROUND HERE?

03:08.155 --> 03:09.623
AND I KNOW
YOU ONLY DRINK TEA,

03:09.723 --> 03:11.525
BUT WHAT ABOUT
YOUR POOR PATIENTS?

03:11.625 --> 03:14.428
UM, NO OFFENSE,
BUT DON'T YOU FEEL

03:14.528 --> 03:16.930
THERE'S SOMETHING
AGGRESSIVE IN WHAT
YOU'RE DOING HERE?

03:17.030 --> 03:20.468
I MEAN, YOU HAVEN'T
EVEN ASKED ME

03:20.568 --> 03:23.704
IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT I WANT,
IF IT'S OKAY WITH ME.

03:28.141 --> 03:31.579
OKAY.
OKAY, FINE.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.983
IT'S JUST
A STUPID MACHINE. JEEZ.

03:36.083 --> 03:39.587
I'M JUST TRYING
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT
YOU WANTED TO SAY WITH THIS.

03:39.687 --> 03:41.422
NOTHING.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.658
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
THAT BY ME BRINGING
THIS TO YOU

03:44.758 --> 03:47.295
THAT I'M, WHAT,
TRYING TO BUY YOU?

03:47.395 --> 03:51.632
I DON'T KNOW.
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT FOR ME
TO HAVE A COFFEE MACHINE?

03:51.732 --> 03:55.369
MAYBE BECAUSE
THE COFFEE THAT IT MAKES
IS TOP QUALITY.

03:55.469 --> 03:58.306
I COME HERE ONCE A WEEK
FOR THE TIME BEING

03:58.406 --> 04:00.974
AND I NEED COFFEE HERE
MORE THAN ANYWHERE ELSE

04:01.074 --> 04:02.810
TO OPEN UP
AND ALL THAT CRAP.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.846
SO I BROUGHT
THE MACHINE WITH ME
AND-- OH, HEY...

04:07.281 --> 04:09.116
SIX DIFFERENT KINDS
OF BEANS

04:09.216 --> 04:13.587
FROM THE TOTALLY BITTER
GOURMET GUATEMALA...

04:13.687 --> 04:15.489
TO THE KIND
THAT POSTAL PILOTS DRINK--

04:15.589 --> 04:18.926
JUNGLE JAVA,
WHICH IS SICKENINGLY SWEET.

04:21.629 --> 04:23.897
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'VE GOT AN IDEA:

04:23.997 --> 04:25.833
DEDUCT IT
FROM WHAT I OWE YOU.

04:25.933 --> 04:28.669
I DON'T THINK SO.
SORRY.

04:33.441 --> 04:36.610
COULD YOU BE MAD AT ME
FOR SOMETHING ELSE ALTOGETHER?

04:36.710 --> 04:40.648
- LIKE WHAT?
- BECAUSE I MET
A PATIENT OF YOURS.

04:40.748 --> 04:43.317
- YOU MET
A PATIENT OF MINE?
- YESTERDAY.

04:43.417 --> 04:47.287
I GOT THE DAYS WRONG
AND I ACCIDENTALLY
MET LAURA.

04:51.392 --> 04:56.364
I GATHER IT'S
A DELICATE SITUATION
WHEN PATIENTS MEET, YEAH?

04:56.464 --> 04:58.432
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"A DELICATE SITUATION"?

04:58.532 --> 05:01.034
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
I THOUGHT YOU THERAPISTS
HAD SOME KIND OF...

05:01.134 --> 05:03.003
ETHICAL CODE.

05:03.103 --> 05:06.206
LIKE I TELL YOU
INTIMATE DETAILS
ABOUT HER...

05:06.306 --> 05:08.876
THINGS SHE MAY NOT
WANT HER THERAPIST
TO KNOW ABOUT HER.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.879
I LEAVE, SHE WALKS IN
AND TELLS YOU THE SAME KIND
OF INFORMATION ABOUT ME.

05:11.979 --> 05:14.582
COULD THAT BE
CONSIDERED A BREACH
IN YOUR ETHICAL CODE?

05:14.682 --> 05:17.951
I DON'T THINK THERE'S
ANY ETHICAL PROBLEMS, NO.

05:18.051 --> 05:20.020
OF COURSE I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO DISCUSS OTHER PATIENTS,

05:20.120 --> 05:23.457
BUT YOU ARE FREE
TO TALK ABOUT WHAT'S
HAPPENING IN YOUR LIFE

05:23.557 --> 05:26.360
AND... WHAT'S HAPPENING
BETWEEN YOU AND LAURA

05:26.460 --> 05:28.696
LIKE--
LIKE ANYTHING ELSE.

05:28.796 --> 05:31.031
OKAY, BUT WHAT'S HAPPENING
BETWEEN ME AND LAURA

05:31.131 --> 05:33.701
WOULDN'T HAVE
HAPPENED IF WE WEREN'T
PATIENTS OF YOURS.

05:33.801 --> 05:35.903
I MET HER
RIGHT OUT FRONT HERE.

05:37.204 --> 05:38.606
THAT PROBABLY
WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED

05:38.706 --> 05:40.608
ANYWHERE ELSE
ON THE PLANET.

05:40.708 --> 05:43.977
SO-- SO YOU BELIEVE THERE'S
KIND OF A UNIQUE SIGNIFICANCE

05:44.077 --> 05:47.948
TO THE FACT THAT
YOU MET A PATIENT OF MINE?
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS?

05:49.316 --> 05:51.585
I'M ASKING YOU.

05:54.388 --> 05:57.425
OKAY.
( inhales )

05:57.525 --> 05:59.993
I THINK WE'VE
STARTED THERAPY, ALEX.

06:01.529 --> 06:03.564
- WHAT?
- YOU BROUGHT ME
A COFFEE MACHINE

06:03.664 --> 06:06.199
BECAUSE YOU INTEND
TO COME HERE MORE OFTEN

06:06.299 --> 06:08.602
AND YOU WANT
TO FEEL AT HOME.

06:08.702 --> 06:11.672
THROUGH LAURA,
YOU'RE TRYING TO RELAY
THAT MESSAGE TO ME.

06:11.772 --> 06:15.843
"SHE'S YOUR PATIENT
AND I AM TOO."

06:15.943 --> 06:18.879
SO WE ARE...

06:18.979 --> 06:20.914
OFFICIALLY IN THERAPY.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.653
ABOUT THE COFFEE MACHINE,
LET'S DO THIS--

06:25.753 --> 06:30.090
UM, LET'S JUST SAY
IT'S HERE ON LOAN.

06:31.459 --> 06:33.527
AS LONG AS I KEEP
COMING HERE, IT'S HERE.

06:33.627 --> 06:36.129
WHEN IT'S OVER,
I'LL TAKE IT WITH ME.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.165
DEAL?

06:38.999 --> 06:40.434
OKAY.

06:40.534 --> 06:42.269
I GUESS, UM...

06:42.369 --> 06:44.705
I-- I WOULD LIKE SOME--

06:44.805 --> 06:48.208
SOME TIME TO THINK
IT OVER, THOUGH,
BUT IT'S OKAY.

06:48.308 --> 06:51.545
HEY, THINK POSITIVE.

06:52.312 --> 06:54.582
MMM.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.752
IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY,
YOUR WIFE

06:58.852 --> 07:01.555
DOESN'T ALLOW YOU
TO DRINK COFFEE AT HOME.

07:01.655 --> 07:04.492
- THAT'S CORRECT.
- DO YOU FEEL THAT THIS
IS A PLACE

07:04.592 --> 07:06.494
WHERE YOU CAN
SAY AND DO THINGS

07:06.594 --> 07:10.063
THAT YOU MIGHT NOT
BE ALLOWED TO DO AT HOME?

07:10.163 --> 07:11.331
NO NO,
THAT ISSUE'S SOLVED...

07:11.431 --> 07:13.601
THANKS TO YOU.

07:15.603 --> 07:17.738
I LEFT HOME.

07:17.838 --> 07:20.173
YOU REALLY HELPED ME
WITH THAT IN OUR LAST SESSION,

07:20.273 --> 07:24.177
SHOWED ME THAT LEAVING HOME
WAS MY OWN PERSONAL DECISION.

07:25.212 --> 07:26.547
HEY, DOC, I'M SERIOUS.

07:26.647 --> 07:28.916
YOU REALLY DID HELP ME.

07:29.016 --> 07:31.519
I LEFT HERE
MUCH MORE DETERMINED
THAN WHEN I ARRIVED

07:31.619 --> 07:33.721
TO CARRY OUT

07:33.821 --> 07:37.491
THIS DISENGAGEMENT.
I WENT STRAIGHT HOME

07:37.591 --> 07:39.426
AND TOLD MICHAELA
I WANTED TO LEAVE HOME.

07:39.527 --> 07:41.128
AND I SAID IT
IN THE SAME WAY

07:41.228 --> 07:44.464
I'D TELL HER
I WAS GOING TO TAKE
THE CAR TO THE GARAGE.

07:44.565 --> 07:47.635
AND IS THAT WHAT
YOU REALLY FELT,

07:47.735 --> 07:51.639
THAT IT WAS
SO TRIVIAL?

07:51.739 --> 07:54.174
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
I FELT. ABSOLUTELY.

07:54.274 --> 07:55.676
AND HERE'S
HOW IT HAPPENED.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.377
MICHAELA WAS
MAKING SALMON--

07:57.477 --> 07:59.580
IT'S ALWAYS SALMON
ON TUESDAYS--

07:59.680 --> 08:04.184
AND I TOLD HER
I WANTED TO LEAVE HOME.

08:04.284 --> 08:06.887
LET ME TELL YOU,
SHE DIDN'T EVEN TURN
HER HEAD AWAY FROM THE STOVE.

08:11.424 --> 08:13.827
SHE JUST SAID THAT, UM...

08:13.927 --> 08:16.163
"I COULD'VE GUESSED
THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

08:17.831 --> 08:21.401
AND YOU NEVER
SURPRISE ME, ALEX.
NOT EVEN NOW."

08:21.501 --> 08:23.203
HOW DID YOU FEEL
ABOUT THAT?

08:23.303 --> 08:27.140
WERE YOU--
WERE YOU HURT BY THAT?

08:29.543 --> 08:31.812
SHE WASN'T TRYING
TO HURT ME.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.849
IT'S JUST THE WAY
SHE IS AND...

08:37.450 --> 08:40.688
I MAY HAVE DONE
HER WRONG HERE LAST WEEK,
THE WAY I PRESENTED HER.

08:40.788 --> 08:43.924
BUT YOU'VE GOTTA UNDERSTAND,
SHE'S A SUPERINTELLIGENT WOMAN.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.259
WHEN SHE WAS 22 YEARS OLD,
SHE WAS ALREADY WORKING

08:46.359 --> 08:47.795
ON HER PhD
AT GEORGETOWN,

08:47.895 --> 08:49.897
SO IF SHE SAYS
SHE WAS EXPECTING IT,

08:49.997 --> 08:53.533
THEN I'VE GOTTA BELIEVE
SHE SAW ME GOING
THROUGH SOMETHING

08:53.634 --> 08:56.570
SINCE THE BOMBING
AND THE HEART ATTACK

08:56.670 --> 08:59.807
AND THE SUSPENSION
FROM THE FORCE.

08:59.907 --> 09:02.876
SHE SAW MUCH MORE THAN
I WAS WILLING TO SHOW

09:02.976 --> 09:06.546
AND REALIZED
THAT IT COULD RESULT
IN US SEPARATING.

09:06.647 --> 09:08.849
MMM. YOU KNOW
WHAT'S INTERESTING

09:08.949 --> 09:12.252
IS THAT YOU'RE TALKING TODAY
ABOUT YOUR WIFE LIKE...

09:13.654 --> 09:16.356
YOU KNOW, SHE WAS
SOME MYTHICAL SUPERWOMAN

09:16.456 --> 09:19.793
THAT'S ABLE
TO ANTICIPATE EVERYTHING
10 STEPS IN ADVANCE.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.529
AS FAR AS INTELLIGENCE
GOES, ABSOLUTELY.

09:22.630 --> 09:24.464
REALLY, NO MATTER
WHAT ELSE YOU SAY ABOUT HER,

09:24.564 --> 09:28.602
SHE'S GOT THE BRAINS
OF A ROCKET SCIENTIST
ON THE MANHATTAN PROJECT.

09:28.702 --> 09:30.604
STILL, WASN'T THERE
SOMETHING

09:30.704 --> 09:34.141
IN HER REACTION
THAT DISAPPOINTED YOU?

09:34.241 --> 09:37.244
I MEAN, YOU COME HOME,
YOU DROP THIS BOMBSHELL

09:37.344 --> 09:40.848
AND SHE'S
INDIFFERENT TO YOU.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.851
YEAH, BUT THAT ISN'T
THE CASE HERE.

09:43.951 --> 09:45.819
WE'RE NOT ONE
OF THOSE COUPLES

09:45.919 --> 09:47.955
THAT CREATES DRAMA
ALL THE TIME.

09:48.055 --> 09:50.791
ON THE CONTRARY,
WE COULD'VE DRAGGED
THIS ON FOR YEARS

09:50.891 --> 09:53.260
JUST FOR THE SAKE
OF THE KIDS, AS THEY SAY.

09:53.360 --> 09:56.463
- HAVE YOU TOLD
THE KIDS YET?
- NO, NOT YET.

09:56.563 --> 09:58.431
NOW ROY, MY ELDEST,
HE'S, UH--

09:58.531 --> 10:00.167
HE'S BEEN LOCKED UP
IN HIS ROOM FOR DAYS

10:00.267 --> 10:02.169
DOING SOME KIND
OF CHESS CHAMPIONSHIP
ON THE INTERNET.

10:02.269 --> 10:05.572
AND NOELLE, MY DAUGHTER,
SHE'S ON SOME KIND
OF SCHOOL TRIP.

10:05.673 --> 10:08.241
BUT YOU WILL HAVE TO
TELL THEM AT SOME TIME.

10:08.341 --> 10:09.843
OF COURSE.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.646
SOMEDAY THEY'LL
HAVE TO ACCEPT THE FACT

10:12.746 --> 10:14.281
THAT THEIR FATHER

10:14.381 --> 10:16.784
LEFT HOME TO LOOK
FOR A NEW LIFE.

10:18.151 --> 10:20.187
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING
THEY CAN UNDERSTAND
AT THEIR AGE.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.756
AND HOW DO YOU THINK
THEY'LL FEEL ABOUT THAT?

10:24.124 --> 10:25.859
WELL...

10:27.427 --> 10:30.263
ROY WILL UNDERSTAND ME
FOR SURE.

10:31.498 --> 10:33.266
HE'S A VERY SPECIAL BOY.

10:33.366 --> 10:36.937
HE HAS, UM, INNER TRUTH.

10:39.707 --> 10:41.675
YOU KNOW...

10:41.775 --> 10:43.977
ROY'S 11 YEARS OLD

10:44.077 --> 10:46.179
AND HE HARDLY
EVER LEAVES THE HOUSE.

10:46.279 --> 10:49.883
HE JUST SITS
AT HOME AND HE SITS
BY THE COMPUTER

10:49.983 --> 10:51.985
AND PLAYS CHESS AND--

10:52.085 --> 10:54.955
( chuckles )
I MEAN, HE JUST--
NO GIRLFRIENDS,

10:55.055 --> 10:57.190
NO BUDDIES,
NO BASKETBALL.

10:57.290 --> 11:00.493
AND AT FIRST IT DROVE
ME CRAZY, 'CAUSE HE JUST
SEEMED SO MISERABLE,

11:00.593 --> 11:02.662
SO LONELY,

11:02.763 --> 11:04.698
UNPOPULAR.

11:04.798 --> 11:07.467
I TRIED EVERYTHING.
I-- I ORGANIZED TOURS

11:07.567 --> 11:10.070
AT THE AIR FORCE MUSEUM
FOR ALL THE KIDS.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.940
THEY COULD COME
AND SIT IN THE COCKPIT
OF A REAL F-16,

11:13.040 --> 11:15.208
PLAY WITH
THE SIMULATORS AND...

11:16.609 --> 11:18.746
( sighs )
IT WAS NO USE.

11:18.846 --> 11:21.681
I MEAN, THOSE TOURS,
HE'D WALK AROUND ALL ALONE.

11:21.782 --> 11:26.619
YEAH. THE ONLY ONE
NEAR HIM WAS LIKE SOME--

11:26.720 --> 11:28.221
I DON'T KNOW,
SOME UGLY LEPER KID

11:28.321 --> 11:30.991
THAT ALL THE KIDS WERE
AFRAID TO GET NEXT TO.

11:34.261 --> 11:36.897
IT'S KIND OF HARD
TO SEE THAT, ISN'T IT?

11:37.731 --> 11:39.699
YEAH.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.335
SOMETIMES IT'S HARDER
FOR US AS PARENTS

11:42.435 --> 11:43.871
TO SEE OUR KID LONELY

11:43.971 --> 11:46.974
THAN IT IS
FOR THE KID HIMSELF.

11:51.745 --> 11:54.047
IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME
TO REALIZE THAT.

11:57.450 --> 12:00.087
THEN I REALIZED THAT...

12:00.187 --> 12:02.389
HE WAS HAPPY.

12:02.489 --> 12:04.357
THAT I HAD THE PROBLEM.

12:04.457 --> 12:07.360
THAT I COULDN'T
ACCEPT THE FACT

12:07.460 --> 12:08.929
THAT HE WASN'T POPULAR.

12:09.029 --> 12:10.931
THAT HE'S AN OUTSIDER,
AND THAT'S OKAY.

12:11.031 --> 12:12.432
IT'S JUST HIS PERSONALITY.

12:12.532 --> 12:15.302
I USED TO GIVE
HIM AND MICHAELA
SUCH A HARD TIME.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.805
I'D CALL THE COUNSELOR,
I'D CALL THE TEACHERS,

12:17.905 --> 12:19.807
AND EVERYBODY SAID,
"THERE'S NO PROBLEM.

12:19.907 --> 12:22.409
THE BOY FEELS GOOD
ABOUT HIMSELF.

12:22.509 --> 12:24.077
IT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS."

12:25.078 --> 12:27.380
WAS IT HARD
FOR YOU TO ACCEPT?

12:27.480 --> 12:30.483
YEAH, BUT,
YOU KNOW, TODAY...

12:30.583 --> 12:34.254
I'M JEALOUS OF HIM,
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T
NEED ANYBODY.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.756
HE'S GOT HIS OWN WORLD.
HE'S GOT HIS MOVIES AND BOOKS

12:36.857 --> 12:38.926
AND COMPUTER GAMES
AND CHESS AND--

12:39.026 --> 12:41.962
AND THE KID WAS BORN
WITHOUT A COMPETITIVE
BONE IN HIS BODY.

12:42.062 --> 12:43.730
EVEN THE CHESS STUFF,
IT'S NOT ABOUT WINNING.

12:43.831 --> 12:45.598
HE DOESN'T CARE IF HE WINS.
HE JUST--

12:45.698 --> 12:47.968
HE LIKES THE THINKING
IT REQUIRES.

12:48.068 --> 12:50.703
A FEW YEARS AGO
I TRIED TO ORGANIZE
THIS PING-PONG TOURNAMENT

12:50.804 --> 12:52.840
FOR HIS-- FOR HIS CLASS
IN THE BACKYARD.

12:52.940 --> 12:56.343
HE TURNS TO ME AND HE SAYS,
"DAD, DON'T YOU FEEL SORRY
FOR THESE KIDS?

12:56.443 --> 12:58.879
ONLY ONE WILL WIN,
AND IT'S PROBABLY ROBERT.

12:58.979 --> 13:02.415
AND THE REST
WILL LOOK PATHETIC
IN FRONT OF THE GIRLS.

13:03.483 --> 13:05.485
DON'T YOU FEEL
SORRY FOR THEM?"

13:07.154 --> 13:09.923
I SWEAR,
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
HE GOT THOSE GENES.

13:10.023 --> 13:12.792
CERTAINLY NOT FROM ME.

13:14.327 --> 13:17.931
YOU THINK HE'S TOO GOOD
TO BE CONNECTED
TO YOUR GENES?

13:18.031 --> 13:20.000
ARE YOU
MAKING FUN OF ME?

13:20.100 --> 13:23.270
I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT YOURSELF.

13:23.370 --> 13:24.972
THIS BOY IS
YOUR OWN FLESH AND BLOOD.

13:25.072 --> 13:28.876
YOU-- YOU LOVE HIM
DEARLY,

13:28.976 --> 13:32.279
YOU'RE VERY PROUD
OF HIS BEAUTIFUL QUALITIES

13:32.379 --> 13:34.114
AND YET YOU THINK,

13:34.214 --> 13:36.884
"WELL, HE'S THE EXACT
OPPOSITE OF ME.

13:36.984 --> 13:40.888
HE COULDN'T POSSIBLY
BE CONNECTED TO ME."

13:42.155 --> 13:43.924
PLEASE, LET'S NOT GET
INTO THAT AGAIN.

13:44.024 --> 13:46.659
NO. THIS IS COMPLETELY
A GENETIC ISSUE.

13:46.759 --> 13:49.930
LOOK, HE GOT THE FEMALE GENES
FROM MICHAELA AND MY MOTHER.

13:50.030 --> 13:51.731
MY MOTHER,
SHE WAS THE SAME WAY.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.566
THERE WAS SELFLESSNESS
IN EVERYTHING SHE DID,

13:53.666 --> 13:55.368
JUST LIKE MICHAELA.

13:55.468 --> 13:57.304
SHE NEVER FELT LIKE

13:57.404 --> 13:59.372
SHE WAS MISSING OUT
ON SOMETHING SOMEWHERE ELSE.

13:59.472 --> 14:02.242
SHE DIDN'T CARE
IF SHE WAS FULFILLING
HERSELF AND ALL THAT SHIT.

14:02.342 --> 14:06.246
THERE WAS--
THERE WAS SOMETHING
PURE ABOUT HER,

14:06.346 --> 14:09.282
WHOLESOME-- LIKE ROY.
NO, HE GOT THAT FROM HER.

14:09.382 --> 14:14.254
SO THE WOMEN
IN YOUR FAMILY ARE...

14:14.354 --> 14:17.724
THEY'RE PURE
AND WHOLESOME,
UNBLEMISHED.

14:17.824 --> 14:20.793
AND THAT THE MEN ARE
SOMEHOW THE OPPOSITE--

14:20.894 --> 14:25.398
UH, DIRTY, IN CONFLICT
WITH THEMSELVES.

14:31.371 --> 14:34.241
THAT'S NOT
A BAD DESCRIPTION
OF MY FATHER--

14:34.341 --> 14:36.043
DIRTY AS HELL.

14:36.143 --> 14:40.180
HE KEPT FALLING IN LOVE
WITH DIFFERENT WOMEN
AT THE OFFICE.

14:40.280 --> 14:44.117
HE WAS HAVING
AFFAIRS LIKE SOME KIND
OF DIRTY DOG, YES.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.886
AND THE GUY HAD IT MADE.
HE HAD A WOMAN AT HOME
WHO LOVED HIM,

14:46.987 --> 14:50.057
LET HIM HAVE HIS CAREER,
NO QUESTIONS ASKED.

14:50.157 --> 14:52.025
SHE TOOK CARE
OF THE KIDS AND MADE SURE

14:52.125 --> 14:55.095
THAT THE ENTITY
CALLED "FAMILY" EXISTED.

14:56.663 --> 14:58.531
SEE, WHAT YOU'VE GOT
TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT MY DAD,

14:58.631 --> 15:02.202
HE LIVED THIS WHOLE LIFE
ON THIS CIVIL-RIGHTS-
PIONEER TICKET.

15:02.302 --> 15:05.838
YOU KNOW, A GUY
WHO SURVIVED THE KLAN
AND MARCHED WITH KING.

15:05.939 --> 15:07.874
WHO COULD SAY
ANYTHING TO HIM?

15:07.975 --> 15:10.377
HE SUFFERED FOR US ALL.

15:10.477 --> 15:12.079
MMM.

15:12.179 --> 15:15.983
AND YOUR--
YOU MOTHER WASN'T, UH,
PART OF THAT MOVEMENT?

15:17.184 --> 15:18.851
I LIKE HIM.
I LIKE MY DAD.

15:18.952 --> 15:21.454
SHE WAS
FROM BACK EAST,
FROM DELAWARE.

15:21.554 --> 15:24.624
WELL-BRED.
SHE WAS THE HOPE
OF THE FAMILY.

15:24.724 --> 15:26.759
A PIANIST.

15:26.859 --> 15:29.196
SHE STUDIED
AT THE MUSIC ACADEMY.

15:31.965 --> 15:33.633
SHE WAS CONSIDERED
A VIRTUOSO.

15:33.733 --> 15:35.502
SHE COULD PLAY LISZT
IN HER SLEEP.

15:35.602 --> 15:36.669
- YOU KNOW LISZT?
- MM-HMM.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.671
ONLY LISZT
COULD PLAY LISZT.

15:41.774 --> 15:45.178
YEAH, SHE WAS
REALLY SOMETHING.
SHE WAS, UM...

15:47.414 --> 15:49.016
RARE.

15:51.884 --> 15:54.821
YOU NEVER SENSED
ANY BITTERNESS IN HER

15:54.921 --> 15:59.226
THAT THE WHOLE MUSIC THING
NEVER MATERIALIZED.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.098
YOU STILL MISS HER?

16:05.999 --> 16:08.135
OF COURSE.

16:11.771 --> 16:14.841
SHE SAVED HIS LIFE.

16:14.941 --> 16:17.444
BY THAT I MEAN
AT THE MARCH ON WASHINGTON...

16:17.544 --> 16:19.246
IN '63.

16:19.346 --> 16:21.081
RIGHT BEFORE
KING'S BIG SPEECH,

16:21.181 --> 16:23.016
MAHALIA JACKSON
SANG THAT SONG

16:23.116 --> 16:25.052
"I BEEN 'BUKED
AND I BEEN SCORNED."

16:27.087 --> 16:29.622
AND THEY CAUGHT EYES
IN THE CROWD,

16:29.722 --> 16:34.161
AND THEY BOTH HAD TEARS
FLOWING DOWN THEIR FACES.

16:34.261 --> 16:36.329
AND THEY FELT CONNECTED.

16:37.364 --> 16:40.700
MY FATHER WAS
THIS LONELY ANGRY MAN,

16:40.800 --> 16:42.702
AND SHE--

16:42.802 --> 16:45.205
WELL, SHE MELTED HIM.

16:48.308 --> 16:50.610
SHE WAS THE ONLY PERSON
HE EVER TRUSTED.

16:51.978 --> 16:54.247
HE WAS AT WAR
WITH THE REST
OF THE WORLD.

16:55.548 --> 16:57.750
AND-- AND THE WAR
AIN'T OVER, BELIEVE ME.

17:02.189 --> 17:05.125
HMM. AND STILL HE--

17:05.225 --> 17:06.593
HE CHEATED ON HER.

17:06.693 --> 17:10.097
CONSTANTLY. THE GUY
JUST WANTED MORE AND MORE.

17:10.197 --> 17:14.167
- ALL THE TIME.
- BUT HE DIDN'T LEAVE HER?

17:14.267 --> 17:16.336
NO, WHAT ARE YOU CRAZY?
WHY WOULD HE LEAVE HER?

17:16.436 --> 17:19.272
- HE LOVED HER.
- YOU'RE SURE ABOUT THAT?

17:20.407 --> 17:22.475
ARE-- ARE YOU SURE
THAT IT WASN'T JUST

17:22.575 --> 17:24.844
THAT HE HELD HER
IN VERY HIGH ESTEEM

17:24.944 --> 17:28.181
AND THAT
HE WAS REALLY GRATEFUL

17:28.281 --> 17:30.283
FOR EVERYTHING
THAT SHE'D DONE FOR HIM
THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE?

17:30.383 --> 17:32.085
ARE YOU TRYING
TO JUSTIFY HIM?

17:32.185 --> 17:35.188
IF HE DIDN'T LOVE HER,
HE COULD'VE LEFT. WHY MAKE
HER LIFE MISERABLE?

17:35.288 --> 17:38.291
OKAY. AND YOU,
UNLIKE HIM,

17:38.391 --> 17:41.094
YOU'RE TRYING
TO DO THE RIGHT THING?

17:42.195 --> 17:44.564
YOU'RE LEAVING HOME
JUST LIKE THAT.

17:44.664 --> 17:48.601
YOU'RE NOT
DRAGGING OUT THINGS
LIKE HE DID.

17:49.969 --> 17:51.971
OKAY. ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.207
I SEE YOU BELIEVE
IN THE WHOLE THEORY THAT

17:54.307 --> 17:57.110
CHILDREN TRY TO RECTIFY WHAT
THEIR PARENTS DID WRONG.

17:57.210 --> 17:58.745
ALL RIGHT.
OKAY. OKAY.

17:58.845 --> 18:02.115
I DON'T KNOW THAT
IT'S ABOUT RECTIFICATION.

18:03.383 --> 18:06.085
I-- I THINK IT'S MORE
WHAT WE CALL A PATTERN.

18:06.186 --> 18:09.522
WE UNCONSCIOUSLY
REPEAT PATTERNS

18:09.622 --> 18:12.625
THAT WE HAVE WITNESSED
IN CHILDHOOD.

18:12.725 --> 18:15.027
BUT YOU SAID I WAS
TRYING TO RECTIFY
WHAT MY FATHER DID.

18:15.128 --> 18:16.829
NO, I THINK YOU'RE
PRESENTING IT THAT WAY,

18:16.929 --> 18:18.365
BUT ON A DEEPER LEVEL

18:18.465 --> 18:22.402
I THINK THERE MAY
BE MORE SIMILARITY

18:22.502 --> 18:25.205
BETWEEN YOU
AND YOUR FATHER'S
VIEW OF MARRIAGE.

18:25.305 --> 18:27.474
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.

18:27.574 --> 18:31.178
REALLY? YOU--
YOU CAN'T SEE ANY WAY

18:31.278 --> 18:33.713
IN WHICH YOU AND YOUR
FATHER MAY HAVE MARRIED

18:33.813 --> 18:35.282
THE SAME
KIND OF WOMAN?

18:35.382 --> 18:37.784
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT
YOU BOTH MARRIED WOMEN

18:37.884 --> 18:40.920
WHOM YOU ADMIRE, BUT--

18:41.020 --> 18:44.557
BUT YOU DON'T
NECESSARILY LOVE.

18:44.657 --> 18:47.894
THAT'S SOME BULLSHIT.
YOU ACTUALLY BUY THIS SHIT?

18:47.994 --> 18:50.129
THAT I'M REPEATING
MY FATHER'S MISTAKES?

18:50.230 --> 18:52.199
LET ME
TELL YOU SOMETHING:

18:52.299 --> 18:53.600
WHAT'S GOING ON
IN MY MARRIAGE

18:53.700 --> 18:55.202
HAS GOT NOTHING TO DO
WITH MY FATHER,

18:55.302 --> 18:57.237
SO STOP COMPARING US.

19:01.908 --> 19:04.911
PERHAPS YOU MIGHT NOT
HAVE LOVED MICHAELA

19:05.011 --> 19:06.413
BECAUSE YOU ADMIRED
HER SO MUCH

19:06.513 --> 19:09.282
FOR BEING SO--
SO PERFECT.

19:09.382 --> 19:11.884
WAIT. WHY ARE WE STILL
TALKING ABOUT MICHAELA?

19:11.984 --> 19:14.287
THAT STORY IS OVER.

19:14.387 --> 19:16.556
BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE
THAT YOUR LEAVING HER

19:16.656 --> 19:19.726
IS REALLY THE SOLUTION
TO HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT YOURSELF.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.794
( metal clinks )

19:37.410 --> 19:39.812
I WANNA GO BACK
TO LAURA FOR A MINUTE.

19:39.912 --> 19:42.282
WH-- WHY IS
IT SO IMPORTANT

19:42.382 --> 19:44.351
TO GO BACK TO LAURA?

19:44.451 --> 19:46.486
IS IT BECAUSE SHE'S
MY PATIENT AND YOU THINK

19:46.586 --> 19:48.321
IT MIGHT BOTHER ME
THAT YOU MET?

19:48.421 --> 19:50.089
WHOA WHOA, I--
I DON'T GET THIS.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.425
WHY CAN'T
I TALK ABOUT HER?

19:52.525 --> 19:54.527
WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL
ABOUT MEETING HER?

19:54.627 --> 19:58.298
- ( bag tears )
- ( metal clanking )

19:58.398 --> 20:00.833
( sighs )
HEY, PAUL...

20:02.134 --> 20:04.504
YOU WON'T BELIEVE
HOW MUCH THIS COST.

20:04.604 --> 20:06.172
$450.

20:06.273 --> 20:07.674
( laughs )
I MEAN...

20:07.774 --> 20:10.042
- ( water sloshes )
- ...THAT'S CRAZY, RIGHT?

20:10.142 --> 20:13.480
TOO BAD THEY
DON'T SELL PROPERTY
ON THE ONLINE AUCTIONS.

20:13.580 --> 20:15.248
I MEAN, NOW THAT MICHAELA
HAS THE HOUSE,

20:15.348 --> 20:17.016
DURING THE INDY 500
OR SOMETHING,

20:17.116 --> 20:19.352
I COULD GO ON,
GET A PLACE IN
THE SAME NEIGHBORHOOD

20:19.452 --> 20:21.554
FOR ALMOST
HALF A MILLION BUCKS.

20:21.654 --> 20:25.758
YOU GOT THE DEAL
OF YOUR LIFE HERE, DOC.

20:25.858 --> 20:28.361
YOU KNOW, SOMEONE
WHO DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT
THE WHOLE TV FACTOR

20:28.461 --> 20:30.196
WOULD'VE PAID $1,500
FOR IT, MINIMUM.

20:30.297 --> 20:32.499
SO IF I'M HERE FOR A YEAR,
THEN THAT MEANS YOU'RE
RENTING IT FOR...

20:32.599 --> 20:35.768
( chuckles )
$8 A WEEK.

20:35.868 --> 20:38.738
COULD WE GET BACK TO
OUR THERAPY SESSION, ALEX?

20:41.040 --> 20:43.042
OH.

20:43.142 --> 20:46.513
OKAY. WELL, LAURA
COULDN'T GET OVER IT.

20:46.613 --> 20:48.415
I SHOWED HER THE MACHINE
AND SHE JUST--

20:48.515 --> 20:50.583
( chuckles )
SHE COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.

20:54.186 --> 20:56.323
WOULD YOU LIKE TO, UH--

20:56.423 --> 21:00.092
WOULD YOU LIKE TO TELL ME
HOW YOU TWO MET?

21:00.192 --> 21:03.129
SURE. I LOST
TRACK OF TIME.

21:03.229 --> 21:07.266
I MOVED IN WITH
MY GAY FRIEND DANIEL
AND HIS LITTLE BOYFRIEND.

21:07.367 --> 21:09.436
- I TOLD YOU
ABOUT THEM.
- YEAH.

21:09.536 --> 21:12.539
AND THEY ARE REAL HAPPY
I LEFT HOME.

21:12.639 --> 21:14.607
THEY BRING THEIR FRIENDS
OVER TO MEET ME

21:14.707 --> 21:17.577
AND THEY'VE TURNED ME INTO
THE TALK OF THE GAY COMMUNITY.

21:17.677 --> 21:19.011
SO I'VE BEEN
GOING ALONG WITH IT.

21:19.111 --> 21:20.780
YOU KNOW,
I GO TO DINNERS, DRINKS.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.350
I EVEN WENT TO THIS GAY CLUB
WITH THEM ON SUNDAY.

21:23.450 --> 21:25.685
THEY TOLD ME
THERE'D BE SOME--
SOME HOT LADIES THERE,

21:25.785 --> 21:27.854
SOMEBODY I COULD PICK UP
THAT AREN'T EVEN LESBIANS.

21:27.954 --> 21:30.790
WELL, AND IT DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING FOR ME.

21:30.890 --> 21:33.626
WHAT IT DID WAS MAKE ME
LOSE TRACK OF TIME.

21:33.726 --> 21:36.496
I WAS UP ALL NIGHT LONG,
SO I COULD'VE SWORN

21:36.596 --> 21:39.466
YESTERDAY WAS TUESDAY,
SO I CAME HERE.

21:39.566 --> 21:41.601
BUT WHEN I GOT HERE
I SAW LAURA LEAVING.

21:41.701 --> 21:44.303
I WALKED UP TO HER
AND I ASKED HER IF
EVERYTHING WAS OKAY.

21:44.404 --> 21:46.272
SHE SAID EVERYTHING
WASN'T OKAY,

21:46.373 --> 21:48.541
THAT SHE RAN OVER A DOG--

21:48.641 --> 21:50.410
OR ALMOST RAN OVER
THIS DOG YESTERDAY MORNING.

21:50.510 --> 21:53.413
THE WAY SHE DESCRIBED IT,
IT SOUNDED LIKE THIS, UH,

21:53.513 --> 21:55.748
THE AIREDALE TERRIER
PEDIGREE.

21:55.848 --> 21:58.250
THE AIREDALE TERRIER IS
THE ONLY DOG IN HISTORY

21:58.351 --> 21:59.852
TO BE KNIGHTED
BY THE KING OF ENGLAND

21:59.952 --> 22:01.721
- FOR BRAVERY IN BATTLE.
- ( espresso machine beeps )

22:01.821 --> 22:03.923
- DID YOU KNOW THAT?
- I-- I DIDN'T KNOW THAT, NO.

22:04.023 --> 22:06.526
YEAH WELL, IT DID.
IT'S AN AMAZING STORY.

22:06.626 --> 22:08.395
I MEAN, THIS DOG--

22:10.062 --> 22:12.064
OKAY, WELL,
MAYBE NEXT TIME.

22:14.501 --> 22:17.404
SO I ASKED HER

22:17.504 --> 22:19.939
IF SHE HAD BEEN
LEAVING A SESSION

22:20.039 --> 22:21.474
WITH YOU.

22:21.574 --> 22:23.009
AND SHE WAS
A BIT TAKEN ABACK

22:23.109 --> 22:25.311
LIKE I HAD CAUGHT HER
IN SOMETHING SHAMEFUL.

22:25.412 --> 22:27.714
HELL, I THOUGHT
ONLY NAVY PILOTS

22:27.814 --> 22:29.716
FELT THAT WAY
ABOUT SEEING A SHRINK.

22:31.117 --> 22:34.220
MMM. AH.

22:34.320 --> 22:36.055
YEAH.

22:36.155 --> 22:38.691
ANYWAY, I ADMITTED TO HER
THAT I WAS SEEING YOU ALSO.

22:38.791 --> 22:40.727
AND I REALIZED THAT
I WAS HERE A DAY EARLY.

22:40.827 --> 22:43.362
SHE THOUGHT THAT WAS
JUST HILARIOUS...

22:43.463 --> 22:46.032
- ( chuckles )
- ...THAT SOMEONE COULD
GET THE DAYS MIXED UP.

22:46.132 --> 22:48.100
AND SHE'S GOT THIS--

22:48.200 --> 22:51.337
I DON'T KNOW,
SHE'S GOT THIS WAY
OF LOOKING AT YOU.

22:51.438 --> 22:53.272
YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE
THIS GIRL, SHE'S GOT--

22:53.372 --> 22:55.141
THERE'S SOMETHING FIERCE
ABOUT THIS GIRL.

22:55.241 --> 22:58.411
- RIGHT?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

22:58.511 --> 23:01.714
I DON'T KNOW.
SHE'S GOT THIS LOOK.
IT'S LIKE--

23:01.814 --> 23:04.517
IT'S LIKE SHE'S USED TO
GETTING HER OWN WAY.

23:04.617 --> 23:06.285
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT SHE SAID?
( laughs )

23:06.385 --> 23:10.690
SHE SAID THAT
YOU COULD RUIN EVEN
A CUP OF LIPTON TEA.

23:12.258 --> 23:14.627
- ( chuckles )
- I MEAN, COME ON.

23:16.896 --> 23:19.165
SO I GUESS YOU'RE BOTH
IN THE SAME, UH--

23:19.265 --> 23:21.200
IN THE SAME BOAT,
SO TO SPEAK.

23:21.300 --> 23:23.670
TOTALLY.
( laughs )

23:23.770 --> 23:26.172
ANYWAY, SO WE GOT
IN MY CAR AND WE

23:26.272 --> 23:29.308
DROVE TO THE ACCIDENT SITE.
NATURALLY, THERE WASN'T
ANY DOG THERE,

23:29.408 --> 23:31.310
SO WE GRABBED
A CUP OF COFFEE

23:31.410 --> 23:33.446
AND I SKETCHED
THE AREA ON A NAPKIN.

23:33.546 --> 23:35.314
AT HER PLACE?

23:35.414 --> 23:36.849
NO NO, WHY WOULD
YOU SAY THAT?

23:36.949 --> 23:38.384
NO, SOME CAFE.

23:38.485 --> 23:41.954
SO I DREW HER
AN OVERHEAD VIEW
OF THE AREA.

23:42.054 --> 23:44.924
I'M A GENIUS AT THAT,
YOU KNOW, THE YARDS
AND THE GREEN AREAS--

23:45.024 --> 23:47.494
ANYWHERE WHERE A DOG MIGHT
MAKE HIMSELF DISAPPEAR.

23:47.594 --> 23:50.663
SOUNDS LIKE
A REAL MILITARY OPERATION.

23:50.763 --> 23:52.431
YEAH.

23:53.866 --> 23:55.502
YEAH.

23:57.570 --> 23:59.506
TO BE HONEST,
I KIND OF MISS THAT,

23:59.606 --> 24:02.374
JUST BEING UP IN THE AIR

24:02.475 --> 24:05.177
REDUCING THE AREA
ON A MAP,

24:05.277 --> 24:08.481
LOOKING FOR A MAN
INTELLIGENCE HAS BEEN
AFTER FOR THREE MONTHS.

24:08.581 --> 24:10.449
SO DID YOU FIND THE DOG?

24:10.550 --> 24:13.520
NO NO, IT PROBABLY WENT
AND DIED SOMEWHERE.

24:14.787 --> 24:17.690
BUT YOU COULD SAY
IT STILL HAD A HAPPY ENDING.

24:22.061 --> 24:24.931
HEY, IS, UH--
IS OUR TIME ALMOST UP?

24:26.733 --> 24:29.301
UM, NO, WE HAVE ABOUT--
WE HAVE ABOUT FIVE MINUTES.

24:29.401 --> 24:31.671
( cell phone beeping )

24:31.771 --> 24:34.974
OH, SORRY. I THOUGHT
THIS THING WAS OFF.

24:36.809 --> 24:39.712
AH. HUH,
SPEAK OF THE DEVIL.

24:39.812 --> 24:41.981
I'M SUPPOSED TO MEET LAURA.
DO YOU MIND IF I TAKE THIS?

24:42.081 --> 24:44.183
SURE, GO AHEAD.

24:45.618 --> 24:47.820
YEAH, HEY.
WHAT'S UP?

24:49.088 --> 24:50.823
NO NO, NOT YET,

24:50.923 --> 24:53.793
BUT JUDGING
FROM PAUL'S FACE,

24:53.893 --> 24:56.128
I THINK HE'LL KICK ME OUT
OF HERE IN A MINUTE OR TWO.

24:56.228 --> 24:58.197
( chuckling )

24:59.431 --> 25:02.268
I KNOW.
RIGHT. OKAY.

25:02.368 --> 25:04.737
YEAH, ALL RIGHT. BYE.

25:06.038 --> 25:08.107
( sighs )

25:08.207 --> 25:09.809
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

25:09.909 --> 25:12.712
SHOULD I GO
FOR HER-- LAURA?

25:13.613 --> 25:15.582
OH, CO-- PAUL.

25:15.682 --> 25:17.584
COME ON, YOU CAN TELL ME.

25:17.684 --> 25:21.654
I KNOW IT'S NOT ETHICAL,
BUT YOU'RE MY SHRINK TOO.

25:21.754 --> 25:25.558
SHE'S THE FIRST WOMAN
I'VE BEEN OUT WITH
IN 15 YEARS.

25:25.658 --> 25:28.661
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
A LOUSY EXPERIENCE.

25:28.761 --> 25:31.063
I'M SORRY, I CAN'T GIVE YOU
THAT KIND OF ADVICE, ALEX.

25:32.699 --> 25:34.867
BUT SHE'S-- SHE'S THE KIND
OF WOMAN THAT,

25:34.967 --> 25:37.169
YOU KNOW, COULD DRIVE
A MAN INSANE.
AM I RIGHT?

25:37.269 --> 25:39.471
- ALEX, I--
- LOOK, PAUL.

25:39.572 --> 25:41.140
JUST MAN TO MAN.
JUST GIVE ME A LITTLE TIP.

25:41.240 --> 25:43.142
- I CAN'T DO THAT.
- THIS COULD AFFECT
MY WHOLE LIFE.

25:43.242 --> 25:45.544
I--
( clears throat )

25:45.645 --> 25:47.880
I CAN'T GIVE YOU
DATING TIPS, ALEX.

25:47.980 --> 25:51.150
SORRY.

25:51.250 --> 25:53.219
JUST STOP IT.

25:55.454 --> 25:57.289
OKAY.

25:59.225 --> 26:00.927
YEAH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT,

26:01.027 --> 26:03.930
'CAUSE I'M NOT USED TO YOU
GIVING ME ADVICE ANYWAY.

26:07.366 --> 26:09.902
BUT, YOU KNOW,
YOU ALWAYS HELP OUT
IN THE END

26:10.002 --> 26:13.572
IN YOUR CRAZY
ROUNDABOUT KIND OF WAY.

26:18.778 --> 26:21.681
( sighs )
OH, AND WHEN SHE'S HERE
FOR HER SESSION,

26:21.781 --> 26:25.551
TRY TO PULL
THE ESPRESSO HANDLE FAST...

26:25.652 --> 26:27.820
'CAUSE SHE LIKES IT
WITH A LOT OF FOAM.

26:30.456 --> 26:34.093
( door opens, closes )

26:36.729 --> 26:39.298
( theme music playing )
