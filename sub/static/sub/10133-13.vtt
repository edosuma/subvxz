Well, no, but I read these.

07:27.030 --> 07:28.782
Plato, "The Republic."

07:28.823 --> 07:30.409
Kafka, "The Metamorphosis"

07:30.450 --> 07:33.995
and "Is That You, Big Guy?

07:30.450 --> 07:33.995
Sightings of Elvis."

07:34.037 --> 07:38.708
And how are you gonna read all

07:34.037 --> 07:38.708
these books before the party?

07:38.750 --> 07:40.585
Well, ur, I, see,

07:38.750 --> 07:40.585
I have this figured out.

07:40.627 --> 07:41.878
What we're gonna do here

07:41.920 --> 07:42.963
is I'll just read the beginning

07:43.004 --> 07:44.005
and ends of each book, right?

07:44.047 --> 07:45.673
"A Tale of Two Cities."

07:45.715 --> 07:49.052
"It was the best of times,

07:45.715 --> 07:49.052
it was the worst of times."

07:49.094 --> 07:51.554
"It is far,

07:49.094 --> 07:51.554
far better rest that I go to

07:51.596 --> 07:52.597
than I have ever known."

07:52.639 --> 07:53.890
Whoa! Surprise ending.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.560
Girls, I can't

07:55.642 --> 07:57.560
go through with this.

07:57.602 --> 08:00.105
I gotta think of one good excuse

07:57.602 --> 08:00.105
not to go to this party.

08:01.606 --> 08:03.942
One O two! Wow!

08:04.859 --> 08:06.861
- I'll be okay.

08:04.859 --> 08:06.861
- Jess.

08:06.903 --> 08:08.280
You wouldn't

08:06.903 --> 08:08.280
be trying to get out

08:08.322 --> 08:09.656
of the party tonight, would you?

08:09.697 --> 08:12.367
Oh, no, no, no, I'll go

08:09.697 --> 08:12.367
to the party tonight

08:12.409 --> 08:14.911
then I'll go

08:12.409 --> 08:14.911
to the hospital tomorrow.

08:14.953 --> 08:17.456
I know what you're saying.

08:14.953 --> 08:17.456
"Jesse, don't be a hero.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.040
Stay in bed and.."

08:19.082 --> 08:21.376
Actually, I better

08:19.082 --> 08:21.376
do that. I'll-I'll go to bed.

08:21.418 --> 08:22.794
Could you point

08:21.418 --> 08:22.794
me to my room? I'm a little..

08:22.836 --> 08:23.837
[doorbell ringing]

08:23.878 --> 08:25.130
Thanks a lot, Jess.

08:28.633 --> 08:31.178
- Eric!

08:28.633 --> 08:31.178
- Becca!

08:31.219 --> 08:32.429
[whispering]

08:31.219 --> 08:32.429
Becca?

08:34.473 --> 08:36.850
Danny, Cynthia,

08:34.473 --> 08:36.850
this is Dr. Eric Trent.

08:36.891 --> 08:38.768
Eric was my favorite professor.

08:38.810 --> 08:41.562
Ah, Rebecca

08:38.810 --> 08:41.562
was my favorite student.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.773
And Jesse's her favorite

08:41.604 --> 08:43.773
boyfriend. Hi, that's me.

08:45.484 --> 08:47.986
- Well, we should be going.

08:45.484 --> 08:47.986
- I'll get your coat.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.612
Right this way.

08:49.654 --> 08:51.365
- Oh, this is a nice coat.

08:49.654 --> 08:51.365
- Oh.

08:51.406 --> 08:52.907
- Here you go.

08:51.406 --> 08:52.907
- Thanks.

08:53.700 --> 08:54.909
- Eh...oh.

08:53.700 --> 08:54.909
- Mm.

08:54.951 --> 08:56.036
- No.

08:54.951 --> 08:56.036
- Ha ha ha.

08:56.077 --> 08:57.120
I'm terribly sorry.

08:57.162 --> 08:58.413
Why don't I just throw it up

08:58.455 --> 09:00.915
in the air and you run under it.

09:00.957 --> 09:03.210
While I take care of the coat,

09:00.957 --> 09:03.210
you can get the door.

09:03.251 --> 09:05.003
Alright.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.463
Goodnight, Jess.

09:06.505 --> 09:10.467
Oh, I forgot. You're sick.

09:06.505 --> 09:10.467
Feel better, sweetheart.

09:10.509 --> 09:12.969
Eric, I will never forget

09:10.509 --> 09:12.969
that seminar you gave

09:13.011 --> 09:14.471
on the romantic poets.

09:14.513 --> 09:15.805
You were inspiring.

09:15.847 --> 09:18.141
Uh, well, I don't

09:15.847 --> 09:18.141
remember the seminar

09:18.183 --> 09:21.144
but I do remember you.

09:21.186 --> 09:24.105
- Ha, ha, Jackie.

09:21.186 --> 09:24.105
- Ha, ha, "Jesse," you..

09:30.487 --> 09:31.988
I'm going to that party.

09:32.030 --> 09:33.323
[instrumental music]

09:36.243 --> 09:37.618
Alright, Joey,

09:36.243 --> 09:37.618
you gotta help me.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.037
'Cause I'm going to that

09:37.660 --> 09:39.037
party, I don't wanna

09:39.079 --> 09:40.288
look dumb in front of Becky.

09:40.330 --> 09:41.915
It's gonna be

09:40.330 --> 09:41.915
a roomful of champions

09:41.956 --> 09:44.125
from "Jeopardy" and I'm

09:41.956 --> 09:44.125
from "The Price is Right."

09:45.752 --> 09:47.795
Relax, Jess. I'll help you out.

09:47.837 --> 09:51.132
I did more in college than goof

09:47.837 --> 09:51.132
off, chase girls and party.

09:51.174 --> 09:53.218
I was in a fraternity too.

09:55.011 --> 09:57.931
Now, let's start

09:55.011 --> 09:57.931
with literature.

09:57.972 --> 09:59.599
Greatest novel ever written?

09:59.640 --> 10:02.227
You say, "I consider

09:59.640 --> 10:02.227
it a toss up between

10:02.269 --> 10:04.521
War and Peace and

10:02.269 --> 10:04.521
Crime and Punishment."

10:04.563 --> 10:08.900
Ooh, the thickest ones. Very

10:04.563 --> 10:08.900
impressive. What else you got?

10:08.942 --> 10:11.986
Well, if people are discussing

10:08.942 --> 10:11.986
classic cinema, you say

10:12.028 --> 10:14.739
"Citizen Kane is certainly

10:12.028 --> 10:14.739
in a class by itself."

10:14.781 --> 10:16.616
"Citizen Kane."

10:14.781 --> 10:16.616
Oh, I saw that movie.

10:16.657 --> 10:19.035
The, uh, fat dude

10:16.657 --> 10:19.035
was in it, right?

10:19.077 --> 10:21.496
Here's a little

10:19.077 --> 10:21.496
intellectual hint.

10:21.538 --> 10:24.999
Never refer to Mr. Welles

10:21.538 --> 10:24.999
as "the fat dude."

10:26.251 --> 10:28.587
Alright. Okay.

10:26.251 --> 10:28.587
I'm feeling smarter already.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.131
- What else you got?

10:28.628 --> 10:31.131
- 'Shakespeare trivia.'

10:31.172 --> 10:32.924
In all the original

10:31.172 --> 10:32.924
stage productions

10:32.966 --> 10:35.885
the women's parts were

10:32.966 --> 10:35.885
actually played by men.

10:35.927 --> 10:38.138
Oh, you mean like that weird

10:35.927 --> 10:38.138
show we saw in Vegas?

10:40.932 --> 10:42.934
You might wanna stay

10:40.932 --> 10:42.934
away from Shakespeare.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.395
Right. Alright,

10:42.976 --> 10:45.395
Joey, I gotta go.

10:45.437 --> 10:47.606
You sure all this stuff's gonna

10:45.437 --> 10:47.606
get me through this party?

10:47.688 --> 10:51.734
Well, if anything else comes up,

10:47.688 --> 10:51.734
just take your glasses and say

10:51.776 --> 10:54.779
"Interesting,

10:51.776 --> 10:54.779
but terribly overrated."

10:54.821 --> 10:55.947
Let me try that. Okay.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.657
[inhales]

10:55.989 --> 10:57.657
Mm.

10:57.698 --> 10:59.784
Interesting,

10:57.698 --> 10:59.784
but terribly overrated.

11:00.952 --> 11:02.287
Congratulations, Jess.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.914
You are now

11:02.329 --> 11:04.914
a sophisticated intellectual.

11:04.956 --> 11:05.999
- Yeah!

11:06.040 --> 11:07.875
Whoo-whoo-whoo!

11:10.044 --> 11:12.130
[soft classical music]

11:16.717 --> 11:18.761
[indistinct chattering]

11:19.429 --> 11:21.348
[laughing]

11:22.474 --> 11:25.226
(male #1)

11:22.474 --> 11:25.226
'"And in the end'

11:25.268 --> 11:26.727
"Only the hunger..

11:29.939 --> 11:31.690
'"The hunger'

11:32.942 --> 11:36.279
The hungry, hungering..

11:37.405 --> 11:39.032
...hunger."

11:39.073 --> 11:41.159
[applause]

11:47.706 --> 11:49.584
What are you doing?

11:49.626 --> 11:51.503
You don't wanna know.

11:53.254 --> 11:55.549
[music continues]

11:55.590 --> 11:57.676
[indistinct conversation]

11:58.885 --> 12:00.094
[clears throat]

12:02.263 --> 12:04.432
Hello. Hi. How're you?

12:02.263 --> 12:04.432
Nice to see you all.

12:04.474 --> 12:06.184
Good evening. Hi. Evening.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.978
Evening. Enchanted, hi.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.978
Nice to see you.

12:09.020 --> 12:11.272
Nice to see you.

12:09.020 --> 12:11.272
Nice to see both of you.

12:11.314 --> 12:14.234
Hi, Becky, how very nice

12:11.314 --> 12:14.234
it is to see you. How're you?

12:14.275 --> 12:16.444
Professor Trent.

12:14.275 --> 12:16.444
Charmed, I'm sure.

12:16.486 --> 12:18.988
[chuckles]

12:16.486 --> 12:18.988
Jess, honey,

12:16.486 --> 12:18.988
I thought you were sick.

12:19.030 --> 12:20.615
Oh, the bacteria

12:19.030 --> 12:20.615
hasn't been born

12:20.657 --> 12:22.992
that can keep me away

12:20.657 --> 12:22.992
from intellectual conversation.

12:23.034 --> 12:25.370
- Pardon me.

12:23.034 --> 12:25.370
- Oh, ah, my good man.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.080
We were just

12:25.412 --> 12:27.080
about to discuss the cinema.

12:27.121 --> 12:28.415
- We were?

12:27.121 --> 12:28.415
- Yes.

12:28.456 --> 12:30.250
Wouldn't you say

12:28.456 --> 12:30.250
that "Citizen Kane"

12:30.291 --> 12:31.918
was the finest film ever made?

12:31.959 --> 12:33.628
Absolutely.

12:33.670 --> 12:35.922
May I check your overcoat, sir?

12:40.176 --> 12:42.554
Speaking of literature,

12:40.176 --> 12:42.554
wouldn't you say

12:42.596 --> 12:44.097
the two finest books

12:42.596 --> 12:44.097
ever written

12:44.138 --> 12:45.848
...would happen

12:44.138 --> 12:45.848
to be "Crime and War"

12:45.890 --> 12:48.518
and "Peace and Punishment?"

12:48.560 --> 12:50.769
[laughs]

12:50.811 --> 12:52.146
What?

12:52.188 --> 12:54.608
I think you

12:52.188 --> 12:54.608
have transposed the titles

12:54.649 --> 12:59.070
of "War and Peace"

12:54.649 --> 12:59.070
and "Crime and Punishment."

12:59.112 --> 13:00.905
Inadvertently.

13:00.947 --> 13:02.156
No, you see,

13:00.947 --> 13:02.156
you missed the joke.

13:02.198 --> 13:03.782
I transposed them

13:02.198 --> 13:03.782
quite "vertently."

13:06.411 --> 13:09.748
- Jess, can I talk to you?

13:06.411 --> 13:09.748
- Excuse me, gents.

13:09.788 --> 13:11.124
What are you doing?

13:11.165 --> 13:13.543
I'm chewing the fat

13:11.165 --> 13:13.543
with your egghead buddies.

13:13.585 --> 13:16.212
And let me tell

13:13.585 --> 13:16.212
you something, they dig me.

13:16.254 --> 13:19.006
Has anybody seen

13:16.254 --> 13:19.006
the new Picasso exhibit

13:19.048 --> 13:21.092
at the Museum of Modern Art?

13:21.134 --> 13:23.886
Oh, I hardly doubt

13:21.134 --> 13:23.886
it's worth the journey.

13:23.928 --> 13:27.140
I find Picasso to be..

13:27.181 --> 13:29.934
...interesting,

13:27.181 --> 13:29.934
but terribly overrated.

13:31.060 --> 13:33.313
You can't be serious.

13:33.354 --> 13:36.274
Just consider

13:33.354 --> 13:36.274
Picasso's blue period.

13:36.316 --> 13:37.776
Yeah, well, that's exactly

13:36.316 --> 13:37.776
what I'm talking about.

13:37.816 --> 13:39.653
I just think he should

13:37.816 --> 13:39.653
have used more colors.

13:41.613 --> 13:44.991
Jesse, I'm curious, uh.

13:45.032 --> 13:46.993
Where did you go to college?

13:48.953 --> 13:51.498
Oh, yeah, I-I went

13:48.953 --> 13:51.498
to college back East.

13:51.539 --> 13:53.583
Way back East.

13:53.625 --> 13:56.169
They're out of business now.

13:56.210 --> 13:58.921
I can see why.

13:58.963 --> 14:00.715
What's that supposed to mean?

14:00.757 --> 14:02.634
Which word

14:00.757 --> 14:02.634
didn't you understand?

14:02.676 --> 14:04.051
I'll tell you which

14:02.676 --> 14:04.051
word I didn't understand.

14:04.093 --> 14:05.553
Excuse us, Eric.

14:06.845 --> 14:08.682
Jesse, you are making

14:06.845 --> 14:08.682
a fool of yourself.

14:08.723 --> 14:12.602
Oh, and he's a genius?

14:08.723 --> 14:12.602
You th...watch this.

14:12.644 --> 14:14.312
Yo, brain wave.

14:16.397 --> 14:20.318
What's the horsepower of

14:16.397 --> 14:20.318
a Harley-Davidson Ultra 1340 cc?

14:20.360 --> 14:22.487
Eighty-five.

14:22.529 --> 14:25.031
Lucky guess.

14:22.529 --> 14:25.031
Who wrote "Hound Dog"?

14:25.072 --> 14:26.700
Leiber and Stoller.

14:26.741 --> 14:29.410
- How tall is Sammy Davis, Jr.?

14:26.741 --> 14:29.410
- Five-three.

14:29.452 --> 14:32.205
- You wanna arm wrestle?

14:29.452 --> 14:32.205
- Excuse me?

14:32.246 --> 14:34.708
You wanna arm wrestle? You heard

14:32.246 --> 14:34.708
me. Right here and now.

14:34.749 --> 14:37.585
That seems a trifle absurd.

14:37.627 --> 14:39.713
Why? Are you a trifle chicken?

14:41.464 --> 14:43.758
Jesse Katsopolis,

14:41.464 --> 14:43.758
