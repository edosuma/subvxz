WEBVTT

00:00.360 --> 00:02.590
kids,back when we were younger,

00:02.600 --> 00:05.490
your Uncle Marshall and I were really into college basketball.

00:05.500 --> 00:08.790
Every year,March Madness would take over the entire apartment.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.620
Hey.What's with the blackboard?

00:10.630 --> 00:11.950
It's our NCAA bracket.

00:11.960 --> 00:14.890
Big board equals big luck!

00:14.990 --> 00:15.990
Hey, that looks familiar

00:16.000 --> 00:18.560
Where did you get it?

00:19.330 --> 00:21.020
Hello.

00:21.030 --> 00:22.590
Uh,I'm looking for my wife,Ms.Aldrin.

00:22.600 --> 00:24.850
There's no school today.It's Saturday.

00:24.860 --> 00:26.690
Of course.How could I forget?

00:27.860 --> 00:30.360
Dumb ass.

00:37.900 --> 00:39.620
Big board!

00:39.630 --> 00:40.950
Big luck!

00:40.960 --> 00:42.890
We found it.No big deal.

00:42.900 --> 00:44.050
Anyway,

00:44.060 --> 00:45.420
every year,Ted and I go in together

00:45.430 --> 00:47.190
on this big money pool out in Staten Island.

00:47.200 --> 00:48.450
Yeah.The winner gets

00:48.460 --> 00:50.720
$100,000 stuffed in a duffel bag.

00:50.730 --> 00:53.520
And you get to keep the duffel bag.

00:53.530 --> 00:55.620
Why do you guys put yourselves through this?

00:55.630 --> 00:56.820
You lose every year.

00:56.830 --> 00:58.020
That's because

00:58.030 --> 00:59.850
in the past,we were just guessing.

00:59.860 --> 01:01.450
This year,we watched every game,

01:01.460 --> 01:02.790
read box scores,tracked injuries.

01:02.800 --> 01:04.150
This isn't March Madness.

01:04.160 --> 01:07.590
This is March Meticulously Thought-outness.

01:07.600 --> 01:09.900
Your team lost 20 minutes ago.

01:11.430 --> 01:14.490
I didn't know they were playing today.

01:15.900 --> 01:17.150
You okay,Barney?

01:17.160 --> 01:19.490
Something strange is going on.

01:19.500 --> 01:21.420
I was down at the hardware store

01:21.430 --> 01:22.850
trying to get a little somethin' somethin'.

01:22.860 --> 01:24.690
Wait.You go to the hardware store

01:24.700 --> 01:25.890
to pick up girls?

01:25.900 --> 01:27.290
There are four kinds of women

01:27.300 --> 01:29.150
who go to the hardware store by themselves.

01:29.160 --> 01:30.490
Of course there are.

01:30.500 --> 01:34.050
Single,recently single,recently divorced,

01:34.060 --> 01:36.190
lesbian who will let me watch.

01:36.200 --> 01:37.890
You could not be more evil.

01:37.900 --> 01:39.220
Sorry.Five.

01:39.230 --> 01:41.230
Recently widowed.

01:41.760 --> 01:43.920
So,I'm talking to this girl...

01:43.930 --> 01:46.620
Look,I'm sure he's in a better place.

01:46.630 --> 01:50.060
Now let's find you a sturdier ladder.

01:51.360 --> 01:53.690
I was only gone for a second when...

01:53.700 --> 01:56.330
See?Skid-proof.

01:59.030 --> 02:01.590
The same thing happened at the pet store yesterday.

02:01.600 --> 02:02.690
Pet store?

02:02.700 --> 02:03.850
Single girl,mid-twenties,

02:03.860 --> 02:05.150
looking for a canine replacement

02:05.160 --> 02:06.990
for the boyfriend who just dumped her.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.190
Instead,finds Barney.

02:08.199 --> 02:09.620
God bless you,Ted.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.560
You're reading my blog.

02:12.360 --> 02:14.690
I'm really bored at work.

02:14.700 --> 02:16.290
I'd call your ex a dog,

02:16.300 --> 02:19.090
but that would be an insult to little Ladybug here.

02:19.100 --> 02:20.990
Oh,I want to take her home right now.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.620
Not without a chew toy from Uncle Barney first.

02:26.260 --> 02:28.150
And when I got back...

02:28.160 --> 02:30.390
I'm sorry,I'm already spoiling her

02:30.390 --> 02:32.900
But diamond in the rough

02:32.900 --> 02:34.390
Could your heart just melt?

02:34.400 --> 02:36.050
Jerk!

02:37.460 --> 02:39.250
Weird,right?

02:39.260 --> 02:42.390
Yeah.The same thing happened last week at the museum.

02:42.400 --> 02:44.050
Ooh,ooh,ooh!Lily.

02:44.060 --> 02:46.020
You pretend to be a struggling young artist

02:46.030 --> 02:47.250
who needs a new muse.

02:47.260 --> 02:48.550
No.

02:48.560 --> 02:49.520
-Marshall. -You're a millionaire art thief

02:49.530 --> 02:50.720
casing the joint for a thrill

02:50.730 --> 02:52.250
money can no longer give you!

02:52.260 --> 02:53.120
Oh.No.

02:53.130 --> 02:54.150
Robin.

02:54.160 --> 02:55.590
You're going blind,

02:55.600 --> 02:57.390
and you're trying to soak up all the beauty

02:57.400 --> 02:58.920
in the world before the darkness descends.

02:58.930 --> 03:00.590
Bingo!

03:00.600 --> 03:02.420
So,I was talking to this girl.

03:02.430 --> 03:04.850
At this point,about 83%.

03:04.860 --> 03:08.790
Soon,these audio guides will be all that I have left.

03:08.800 --> 03:11.300
I'm so sorry.

03:13.160 --> 03:15.490
My God,you are beautiful.

03:17.100 --> 03:18.990
How about I get you a headset

03:19.000 --> 03:21.590
so you can see with your ears like I do?

03:27.400 --> 03:29.520
I couldn't have been gone more than 20 seconds,

03:29.530 --> 03:31.190
but when I came back...

03:31.200 --> 03:34.620
Hmm.You know,I also love the smell of great art.

03:37.700 --> 03:39.290
Why does this keep happening?

03:39.300 --> 03:41.620
Maybe you're not as good a liar as you think you are.

03:42.830 --> 03:44.220
Oh,really?

03:44.230 --> 03:45.920
Then why am I not in prison for perjury?

03:45.930 --> 03:47.620
But I don't want to talk about work.

03:47.630 --> 03:51.520
Something weird is going on here.

03:51.530 --> 03:54.220
But the next night got even weirder.

03:54.230 --> 03:56.650
Alan Alda.

03:56.660 --> 03:57.990
It was Alan Alda.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.360
You never gonna believe what just happened.

04:01.200 --> 04:04.490
Who was that,um,guy from Mash?

04:04.500 --> 04:05.750
The main guy.What...?

04:05.760 --> 04:07.550
Hawkeye from Mash.

04:07.560 --> 04:08.890
How can I be blanking on this?

04:08.900 --> 04:10.090
Alan Alda?

04:10.100 --> 04:12.060
No.

04:14.160 --> 04:16.750
Hey,a word of advice?

04:16.760 --> 04:19.149
That guy you were talking to,Barney Stinson--

04:19.160 --> 04:20.720
I know he seems charming,

04:20.730 --> 04:22.550
but he's just saying whatever it takes

04:22.560 --> 04:24.050
to get in your pants.

04:24.060 --> 04:26.930
Sleeping with Barney was the biggest mistake of my life.

04:29.900 --> 04:31.660
Oh,my God.Where is she?

04:33.860 --> 04:35.550
She must have left.She...

04:35.560 --> 04:37.720
Well,she-she said I hooked up with her?

04:37.730 --> 04:39.390
What was her name?What did she look like?

04:39.400 --> 04:42.450
She didn't say her name,but she had blonde hair,boobs.

04:42.460 --> 04:44.190
Kind of trashy.

04:44.200 --> 04:47.090
Dead in the eyes with an aura of self-loathing and despair?

04:47.100 --> 04:49.020
-Yes! -That's all of them.

04:49.030 --> 04:51.090
Okay.Stay calm.

04:51.100 --> 04:52.090
Let's think this through.

04:52.100 --> 04:53.820
One of the girls

04:53.830 --> 04:55.790
who I lied to,seduced and abandoned

04:55.800 --> 04:57.350
is trying to ruin my life.

04:57.360 --> 05:00.150
Shouldn't be too hard to figure out which one it is.

05:02.000 --> 05:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:09.400 --> 05:13.230
Oh,dear God!

05:27.600 --> 05:29.550
Some woman that I slept with and screwed over 

05:29.560 --> 05:31.290
is trying to ruin my life.

05:31.300 --> 05:33.020
God,why is this happening to me?

05:33.030 --> 05:33.990
It's karma.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.520
Nah,it's not Karma.

05:35.530 --> 05:37.550
She's stripping in Vegas.

05:37.560 --> 05:39.290
Plus,we're good.

05:39.300 --> 05:41.190
Look,if you want to figure out who it is,

05:41.200 --> 05:43.620
why don't you just start by checking your list?

05:43.630 --> 05:45.090
My list?

05:45.100 --> 05:47.490
Dude,do not pretend you're not the kind of guy

05:47.500 --> 05:50.190
who keeps a list of all the girls he's slept with.

05:50.200 --> 05:51.450
I have one.

05:51.460 --> 05:54.790
It's called my marriage license.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.850
Come on,let's see the list.

05:56.860 --> 05:58.850
Ted,don't be crass.

05:58.860 --> 06:01.290
I would never demean the women

06:01.300 --> 06:04.620
that I've slept with by putting their names on some tawdry list.

06:04.630 --> 06:07.650
This is a scrapbook of all of the women I've slept with.

06:07.660 --> 06:09.790
I made it at the Scrapbook Barn on 7th.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.650
Ask for Heloise.Tell her I sent you.

06:12.930 --> 06:14.250
What do you think,Lil?

06:14.260 --> 06:16.320
You recognize the saboteur?

06:16.330 --> 06:17.590
I don't know,Barney.

06:17.600 --> 06:18.990
I only saw her face.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.090
How many of these girls know they're being photographed?

06:22.100 --> 06:25.120
All of them,but only about half buy a copy on the way out.

06:25.130 --> 06:27.390
Oh,Barney,you're never gonna figure out

06:27.400 --> 06:29.520
which one of these is the mystery woman.

06:29.530 --> 06:32.120
All of these women have a right to hate you.

06:32.130 --> 06:33.690
Oh,Lily,come on,lighten up.

06:33.700 --> 06:36.120
I mean,any girl who's gonna be with a guy like Barney

06:36.130 --> 06:38.720
and do this or that,

06:38.730 --> 06:39.990
or this <i>and</i> that,

06:40.000 --> 06:41.590
or do this with those <i>in</i> that...

06:41.600 --> 06:44.290
I mean,she should have known what she was getting into.

06:44.300 --> 06:46.250
Absolutely.

06:46.260 --> 06:48.790
And what I do with these women

06:48.800 --> 06:51.150
should be between me and them.

06:51.160 --> 06:53.250
And you guys.

06:53.260 --> 06:54.850
And Heloise.

06:54.860 --> 06:56.750
She helped me do the decoupage.

06:56.760 --> 06:58.020
I don't know,Barney.

06:58.030 --> 07:00.020
I don't recognize any of these women.

07:00.030 --> 07:03.150
I mean,some minor celebrities,one government official,

07:03.160 --> 07:06.820
and what appears to be a national fast food chain mascot.

07:08.930 --> 07:10.090
This is impossible.

07:10.100 --> 07:11.320
There's too many girls.

07:11.330 --> 07:13.790
How the hell am I gonna narrow this down?

07:13.800 --> 07:15.990
The top 64 women I've slept with,

07:16.000 --> 07:17.350
split into four regions.

07:17.360 --> 07:18.320
This tournament

07:18.330 --> 07:19.650
will systematically narrow down

07:19.660 --> 07:21.990
which girl has the most cause to hate my guts.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.020
Last girl standing has to be the saboteur.

07:24.030 --> 07:25.190
Absolutely not,Barney.

07:25.200 --> 07:27.620
We are not going to make a game out of the women 

07:27.630 --> 07:30.000
you've tricked into sleeping with you.

07:32.960 --> 07:35.020
No way!

07:35.030 --> 07:37.290
The girl who thought he had 12 hours to live

07:37.300 --> 07:39.090
has way more cause to ruin his life

07:39.100 --> 07:40.690
than the girl he fake proposed to.

07:40.700 --> 07:42.790
It's fake proposal girl.

07:42.800 --> 07:45.020
I mean,she hired a wedding planner!

07:45.030 --> 07:47.450
It's 12 hours to live!That girl flew them both to Paris!

07:47.460 --> 07:49.250
Oh,she only bought him a one-way ticket!

07:50.500 --> 07:52.720
Okay,okay,everybody!Hands.

07:52.730 --> 07:54.150
12 hours to live!

07:54.160 --> 07:56.400
Damn it!

07:56.930 --> 07:58.320
Okay,toss up.

07:58.330 --> 07:59.790
"Thought I was Jorge Posada,"

07:59.800 --> 08:01.850
or "You have my dead wife's kidney?"

08:01.860 --> 08:03.820
-Kidney!  -Jorge Posada!

08:03.830 --> 08:06.320
She bought Yankees season tickets to watch him play!

08:06.330 --> 08:08.220
-That's true...  -It's "Dead wife's kidney."

08:08.230 --> 08:10.560
How are we even discussing this?

08:11.100 --> 08:12.720
-Fake baby!  -Lost at sea!

08:12.730 --> 08:15.190
-Fake baby!  -Lost at sea!

08:15.200 --> 08:15.990
I was there.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.490
Trust me.

08:17.500 --> 08:19.960
It's fake baby.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.990
Down to the sweet 16.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.720
And coming out of the Upper West Side,we have the number 

08:24.730 --> 08:26.920
three seed,"Girl who thought I owned Google,"

08:26.930 --> 08:29.390
up against the number seven seed,

08:29.400 --> 08:31.290
"Girl who thought I was a scuba instructor."

08:31.300 --> 08:33.020
You got to go scuba instructor.

08:33.030 --> 08:33.890
You're kidding me!

08:33.900 --> 08:35.190
She got the bends!

08:35.200 --> 08:37.289
Yeah,she did.

08:40.260 --> 08:41.620
Evil twin!

08:41.630 --> 08:42.890
Prince of Norway!

08:42.900 --> 08:44.950
How could it not be Prince of Norway?!

08:44.960 --> 08:46.590
Barney,you're the tiebreaker.

08:46.600 --> 08:48.220
I'm going with Evil Twin.

08:48.230 --> 08:49.750
You're kidding me!

08:49.760 --> 08:52.220
Sorry,but I did sleep with that girl twice.

08:52.230 --> 08:55.330
As Barney <i>and</i> Larney.

09:00.400 --> 09:02.390
Okay,we're down to the Final Four.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.390
What do you think,people?

09:04.400 --> 09:05.890
Come on,dig deep.

09:05.900 --> 09:07.290
Oh!I can't decide.

09:07.300 --> 09:09.220
It could be any one of them.

09:09.230 --> 09:12.590
Is that the blackboard from my classroom?

09:12.600 --> 09:14.450
Come on!Marshall?

09:14.460 --> 09:17.390
I'm tired and sad.

09:17.400 --> 09:18.820
Mosby?

09:18.830 --> 09:20.920
I want to call my mom,

09:20.930 --> 09:24.130
just tell her I love her.

09:24.660 --> 09:26.590
Okay.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.720
Then this is as far as we get.

09:28.730 --> 09:30.520
The Final Four.

09:30.530 --> 09:33.390
It's got to be Meg,Anna,

09:33.400 --> 09:35.950
Kate or Holly.

09:35.960 --> 09:37.890
We are gonna track these girls down,

09:37.900 --> 09:40.220
and you're going to tell me which one approached you at the bar.

09:40.230 --> 09:43.800
You guys stole my blackboard!

09:49.800 --> 09:51.050
Okay,there's her building.

09:51.060 --> 09:53.490
When she comes out,I'm gonna hide,

09:53.500 --> 09:54.950
and once you figure out if she's the girl from the bar,

09:54.960 --> 09:56.990
-we run like hell. -No.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.350
What do you mean,no?

09:58.360 --> 10:00.890
That woman,like every woman in your Final Four,

10:00.900 --> 10:01.950
deserves an apology,

10:01.960 --> 10:03.950
and I'm not telling you if she's the one

10:03.960 --> 10:05.890
until hear you say,"I'm sorry."

10:05.900 --> 10:08.450
Are you nuts?That would involve me speaking to a woman

10:08.460 --> 10:10.090
I've already had sex with,which,frankly,

10:10.100 --> 10:12.890
is a little t like changing the oil in a rental car.

10:14.100 --> 10:15.990
Barney,you're doing this.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.190
Lily,this girl hates me.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.120
I hooked up with her in an apartment

10:19.130 --> 10:20.550
I was pretending was my own,

10:20.560 --> 10:22.990
told her I loved her,and then ditched her there.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.750
She got arrested for trespassing,

10:24.760 --> 10:27.490
bit a cop,and spent eight days in jail.

10:27.500 --> 10:29.820
Oh,crap,there she is!

10:29.830 --> 10:31.820
If she sees me,she's gonna kill me!

10:31.830 --> 10:33.550
Okay,here's what we're gonna do.Hey,Meg!

10:33.560 --> 10:34.650
Over here!

10:34.660 --> 10:35.890
Look who it is!

10:35.900 --> 10:38.660
Yo old friend Barney!

10:41.060 --> 10:42.790
Barney?

10:42.800 --> 10:44.720
If she kills me,I want you to go into my apartment,

10:44.730 --> 10:46.220
grab the metal briefcase under my bed

10:46.230 --> 10:47.990
and throw it in the East River.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.350
What are you doing here?

10:49.360 --> 10:52.250
Look,Meg,we need to talk.

10:52.260 --> 10:54.560
It was all my fault.

10:55.430 --> 10:57.520
I know it was,baby.

10:57.530 --> 10:59.520
I just came on too strong.

10:59.530 --> 11:01.990
And I forgive you.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.690
I love you.

11:03.700 --> 11:05.090
Oh,my God!

11:05.100 --> 11:06.830
I love you,too!

11:07.760 --> 11:08.850
No!

11:08.860 --> 11:10.290
What's the matter with you?

11:10.300 --> 11:12.260
Get off of him!

11:13.060 --> 11:14.450
Look,she's not the one,

11:14.460 --> 11:17.260
but you still owe her an apol...

11:24.130 --> 11:26.420
-So you remember who this one is,right? -Yes.

11:26.430 --> 11:28.490
You told her you were Ted and that you were an architect.

11:28.500 --> 11:29.890
Right,and if you recall,

11:29.900 --> 11:32.450
her computer had a web cam and a T-1 line,so I...

11:32.460 --> 11:34.220
Yeah,I know,Barney,you showed me.

11:34.230 --> 11:36.700
And that still doesn't count as a Christmas present.

11:37.600 --> 11:40.290
So go over there and apologize.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.690
Ah,there she is.

11:42.700 --> 11:43.990
Ooh and she's holding hot coffee.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.450
Maybe she'll throw it in your face.

11:45.460 --> 11:47.720
You're really enjoying this,aren't you?

11:47.730 --> 11:50.000
I'm making a scrapbook.

11:52.600 --> 11:54.220
Anna,hi.

11:54.230 --> 11:57.220
Look who it is,Mr.Big Shot Architect.

11:57.230 --> 11:59.790
If you're here to ask me to take down the Web site,forget it.

11:59.800 --> 12:01.120
What Web site?

12:01.130 --> 12:03.860
Ted-Mosby-Is-A-Jerk-dot-com.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.390
You're right,I do deserve that.

12:08.390 --> 12:10.060
That's all I came here to say.

12:10.060 --> 12:12.320
You know what?

12:12.330 --> 12:14.390
I don't care who knows about it.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.750
Excuse me.Excuse me.

12:16.760 --> 12:19.520
I,Ted Mosby,

12:19.530 --> 12:22.060
am a jerk to women.

12:22.830 --> 12:24.790
Tell your sisters.Tell your daughters

12:24.800 --> 12:26.920
to stay away!

12:26.930 --> 12:32.290
Ted-Mosby-Is-A-Jerk-dot-com.

12:32.300 --> 12:35.590
And that little Web site went on to get 400,000 hits.

12:35.600 --> 12:38.230
Thanks,Barney.

12:41.460 --> 12:44.930
Okay,which one is this again?She's...

12:45.130 --> 12:46.650
Larney!

12:46.660 --> 12:48.290
Die!

12:48.300 --> 12:49.950
Is it her?

12:49.960 --> 12:51.250
-Die!-Smile.

12:51.260 --> 12:53.550
You look good.

12:53.560 --> 12:57.360
Have you lost weight?

13:00.630 --> 13:02.890
We're down to the number one seed.

13:02.900 --> 13:04.420
I knew it was Holly.

13:04.430 --> 13:06.050
It had to be Holly.

13:06.060 --> 13:08.460
Man,I was hoping it wasn't Holly.

13:16.200 --> 13:17.390
Barney,did you hear that?

13:17.400 --> 13:19.360
Somebody's stealing my truck.

13:20.530 --> 13:23.150
Barney?

13:24.360 --> 13:26.550
Barney!

13:32.360 --> 13:34.490
That is the worst thing you've ever done.

13:34.500 --> 13:36.920
That's the worst thing anyone has ever done.

13:36.930 --> 13:39.090
But in my defense,

13:39.100 --> 13:41.830
she was kind of annoying.

13:43.100 --> 13:45.600
She's gonna kill you.

13:46.300 --> 13:48.930
-Barney. -Holly.

13:49.460 --> 13:51.560
Mark,come over here.

13:52.760 --> 13:55.750
Barney,this is my fiance. Mark.

13:55.760 --> 13:58.150
Barney?

13:58.160 --> 14:01.100
You're the Barney who ditched her in the woods?

14:04.530 --> 14:06.620
So you're not mad at Barney?

14:06.630 --> 14:08.120
Don't you want an apology?

14:08.130 --> 14:10.360
An admission of guilt?

14:11.230 --> 14:12.420
Your truck back?

14:12.430 --> 14:14.790
No,whatever happened was in the past.

14:14.800 --> 14:16.890
Mark is my present and my future.

14:16.900 --> 14:19.630
And if you ditching Holly in the woods

14:19.630 --> 14:22.120
made her stop running around with guys like you,

14:22.130 --> 14:23.930
then cheers.

14:24.660 --> 14:25.850
Well then,

14:25.860 --> 14:27.420
to the last Fourth of July weekend

14:27.430 --> 14:29.820
I'll spend getting eaten alive by mosquitoes.

14:29.830 --> 14:32.520
Fourth of July?

14:32.530 --> 14:35.330
We started dating in June.

14:39.430 --> 14:41.150
We ruined their lives.

14:41.160 --> 14:42.720
And the worst part of it

14:42.730 --> 14:45.420
is that you didn't apologize to any of those women.

14:45.430 --> 14:46.720
No,the worst part is that

14:46.730 --> 14:48.550
we still have no idea who my stalker is.

14:48.560 --> 14:51.150
Well,that's because you're going about this all wrong.

14:51.160 --> 14:53.390
I mean,why chase someone who's following you?

14:53.400 --> 14:54.650
All you need to do

14:54.660 --> 14:56.550
is go down to the bar,hit on someone,

14:56.560 --> 14:58.300
and wait until she turns up.

14:58.830 --> 15:00.750
That's not a bad idea.

15:00.760 --> 15:03.520
I'll pretend to be the girl that you're hitting on.

15:03.530 --> 15:05.620
I don't know.That's a lot riding on a girl

15:05.630 --> 15:06.950
who giggles when she lies.

15:06.960 --> 15:08.350
I do not.

15:08.360 --> 15:10.250
Have you ever fallen asleep while eating ribs?

15:10.260 --> 15:12.230
No.

15:14.900 --> 15:16.450
Look,I can do this,okay?

15:16.460 --> 15:19.790
I mean,how else are you going to find out who this girl is.

15:19.800 --> 15:21.020
I'm in.

15:21.030 --> 15:23.020
Okay,here's how it's gonna work.

15:23.030 --> 15:24.090
Now,Lily,

15:24.100 --> 15:26.150
she knows what you look like,

15:26.160 --> 15:27.650
so just hang out at the jukebox,

15:27.660 --> 15:30.500
and don't draw any attention to yourself.

15:34.700 --> 15:36.690
And the guys will be in the booth,

15:36.700 --> 15:40.460
just pretending to have a normal conversation.

15:40.460 --> 15:42.390
Talking,we should be talking.Words.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.450
Here are words.

15:43.460 --> 15:45.320
Why is this so hard?

15:46.660 --> 15:47.950
Laughter!

15:47.960 --> 15:49.650
And then I'll come in,

15:49.660 --> 15:52.160
looking hot as all hell.

15:55.500 --> 15:58.490
Wow,you are gorgeous.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.250
Oh,God,I know that's awful.

16:00.260 --> 16:01.800
-I just,uh.... -Shh,go away.

16:02.600 --> 16:04.700
But come back later.

16:06.960 --> 16:09.790
 <i>And then Barney</i>  <i>will make his move.</i>

16:09.800 --> 16:11.950
Hey,there,how are you doing?

16:11.960 --> 16:13.090
Fine,Barney.

16:13.100 --> 16:14.390
I mean,um,

16:14.400 --> 16:15.620
fine,stranger.

16:17.700 --> 16:20.560
Wow,you really are awful at this,aren't you?

16:20.930 --> 16:22.090
Get your hand

16:22.100 --> 16:23.120
off my thigh,Barney.

16:23.130 --> 16:24.220
It's supposed to look like

16:24.230 --> 16:25.820
we're about to hook up,Robin.

16:25.830 --> 16:27.920
You know I'm curious.

16:27.930 --> 16:29.250
What do you say to these girls

16:29.260 --> 16:30.520
to get them to come home with you?

16:30.530 --> 16:32.690
Usually I just

16:32.700 --> 16:35.530
lean in and whisper this one thing in their ear.

16:43.900 --> 16:46.190
You're a little turned on right now,aren't you?

16:46.200 --> 16:48.430
No.

16:51.060 --> 16:52.320
Oh.Look,somebody's watching us.

16:52.330 --> 16:53.690
Make your move to the bathroom.

16:53.700 --> 16:55.520
Uh,I'm going to go to the bathroom now,

16:55.530 --> 17:00.560
but,uh,when I come back we'll go to my place and have sex.

17:03.900 --> 17:05.349
Dude,dude,dude,look.

17:05.359 --> 17:08.119
Blonde girl heading over to Robin right now.We are go.

17:08.130 --> 17:10.119
I don't know what to do with my hands.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.829
What do I normally do with my hands?

17:15.730 --> 17:16.300
Barney.

17:16.930 --> 17:18.390
I brought a copy of the bracket.

17:18.400 --> 17:20.030
Which one is she?

17:21.599 --> 17:23.589
I don't recognize her.

17:23.599 --> 17:25.819
She's not on the Top 64.

17:25.829 --> 17:27.650
Not even on bracket.

17:27.660 --> 17:30.820
Cinderella story comes out of nowhere to win the whole thing.

17:30.830 --> 17:31.920
That'll warm your heart.

17:31.930 --> 17:34.250
Are you okay?

17:34.260 --> 17:36.760
I don't even recognize her.

17:39.560 --> 17:42.490
I don't remember you.

17:42.500 --> 17:44.890
I've spent the last two days trying to remember

17:44.900 --> 17:47.520
every girl that I've slept with and all the horrible things

17:47.530 --> 17:48.720
that I have done to them.

17:48.730 --> 17:50.890
And I have done some horrible things.

17:51.530 --> 17:55.260
I mean,at one point,I'm pretty sure I sold a woman.

17:56.130 --> 17:57.450
I didn't speak the language,

17:57.460 --> 17:59.420
but I shook a guy's hand,

17:59.430 --> 18:02.260
he gave me the keys to a Mercedes,and I left her there.

18:03.100 --> 18:05.720
I'm the guy who keeps a scrapbook

18:05.730 --> 18:07.620
of all of the women I have slept with,

18:07.630 --> 18:08.950
but I never thought I was the guy

18:08.960 --> 18:12.150
who would sleep with a girl and not even remember her.

18:12.160 --> 18:13.290
So from the bottom of my heart,

18:13.300 --> 18:14.850
for whatever I did to you,

18:14.860 --> 18:17.290
I apologize.

18:17.300 --> 18:18.550
Oh,Barney!

18:18.560 --> 18:21.890
Oh,I'm so proud of you.

18:21.900 --> 18:23.190
That's not her.

18:23.200 --> 18:25.920
-I'm so sorry.-What?What?

18:25.930 --> 18:28.250
Barney,I'm sorry,that's my friend Sally from work.

18:28.260 --> 18:29.790
We just ran into each other.

18:29.800 --> 18:32.520
So I apologized for nothing?

18:32.530 --> 18:34.520
Yes,but it was a great apology.

18:34.530 --> 18:37.120
And a perfect way to end my scrapbook.

18:37.130 --> 18:40.600
I'm going to call this photo "Barney's Redemption."

18:41.760 --> 18:44.430
Could you stop giving me the finger?

18:45.100 --> 18:47.490
* That one shining moment 

18:47.500 --> 18:50.250
* You reached for the sky 

18:50.260 --> 18:55.290
* One shining moment you knew 

18:55.300 --> 18:57.450
* One shining moment 

18:57.460 --> 18:59.920
* You were willing to try 

18:59.930 --> 19:02.890
* One shining moment 

19:02.900 --> 19:04.650
<i>Eventually,</i>  <i>Barney did figure out</i>

19:04.660 --> 19:06.830
<i>who the mysterious girl was. But we on that later</i>

19:40.830 --> 19:43.920
Barney,come back to bed.

19:43.930 --> 19:46.220
You have a shuttle launch tomorrow.

19:46.230 --> 19:48.990
And that asteroid that's headed for Manhattan,

19:49.290 --> 19:52.190
It's not gonna destroy itself.
