00:04.210 --> 00:05.029
[Xander]
Previously on Siren.

00:05.040 --> 00:06.280
Stop!

00:06.290 --> 00:08.167
Aah!

00:08.170 --> 00:10.070
-Who hurt mother?
-A human.

00:10.080 --> 00:12.412
This one,
he kill your mother.

00:12.420 --> 00:13.819
-You're her daughter?
-Rrrr!

00:13.830 --> 00:15.821
-You heard about Klesco?
-Sure.

00:15.830 --> 00:17.616
They're gonna be
moving in a drillship.

00:17.620 --> 00:19.030
Ben, you should see this.

00:19.040 --> 00:20.246
[Ben] You said
that you had no pull

00:20.250 --> 00:21.706
with the oil company.

00:21.710 --> 00:23.029
You're working with them.

00:23.040 --> 00:25.873
[Nicole] I was led
straight to the Alpha.

00:25.880 --> 00:28.326
IfI can convince her
to come wnlllngly,

00:28.330 --> 00:29.911
I think we'll get
a lot more out of her.

00:29.920 --> 00:30.955
I will help soldiers,

00:30.960 --> 00:32.700
butthey
must help Ryn, too.

00:34.080 --> 00:35.411
Now.

00:35.420 --> 00:37.069
You are free to go

00:37.080 --> 00:39.742
on direct orders
of the US. military.

00:39.750 --> 00:41.991
So the military
saves our asses, huh?

00:42.000 --> 00:44.070
They must have
a bigger plan.

00:44.080 --> 00:46.662
Unless they've been here,
watching us

00:46.670 --> 00:47.819
this whole time.

01:05.750 --> 01:09.379
[indistinct conversations]

01:12.080 --> 01:14.378
Research project
for Wounded Warriors.

01:14.380 --> 01:16.701
Soldiers. They fought
for our country.

01:17.710 --> 01:18.699
Our country?

01:18.710 --> 01:20.701
Mm-hmm. America.

01:20.710 --> 01:25.955
Like your colony,
only a lot bigger.

01:25.960 --> 01:28.326
They fight other country?

01:28.330 --> 01:30.207
Yeah.

01:30.210 --> 01:32.110
[female therapist]
One more, one more.

01:32.120 --> 01:34.031
Push through.

01:34.040 --> 01:35.496
Good work.

01:37.750 --> 01:39.411
Must be big fight.

01:41.210 --> 01:43.201
Maybe we can help them.

01:43.210 --> 01:45.030
That's part of the reason
we wanted to bring you here.

01:46.170 --> 01:47.239
The way
you grow new tissue,

01:48.620 --> 01:49.996
maybe it can help
people like them.

01:50.000 --> 01:50.989
[male therapist] Two.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.285
Good. Okay, let it go.

02:01.540 --> 02:03.201
[beeps]

02:03.210 --> 02:05.166
And her?

02:05.170 --> 02:06.205
Test subject.

02:18.670 --> 02:21.070
It's okay, I promise.

02:31.290 --> 02:32.996
[high-pitched call]

02:34.710 --> 02:36.246
Mom?

02:37.290 --> 02:39.030
Well, hello, jailbird.

02:39.040 --> 02:40.610
I know. Crazy, right?

02:40.620 --> 02:41.826
You gotta give me
more than that.

02:41.830 --> 02:44.617
Mom, they found Sean's body.

02:46.210 --> 02:47.450
We were on the boat
when he died,

02:48.710 --> 02:50.450
they needed to get
the facts straight.

02:50.460 --> 02:52.075
That's pretty much it.

02:52.080 --> 02:54.036
Your dad was
worried sick about you.

02:54.040 --> 02:58.079
Yeah. Well,
I appreciate the strings
that he tried to pull.

02:58.080 --> 03:00.878
Oh. Is that why
you came over to see me
in the middle of the day,

03:00.880 --> 03:02.199
when you knew
he wouldn't be here?

03:02.210 --> 03:03.825
Mom, gentle.

03:03.830 --> 03:07.493
This-- It kills me to see
you two fighting like this.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.206
It's so unnecessary.

03:09.210 --> 03:12.748
This family matters more
than some dumb business deal.

03:12.750 --> 03:14.877
So tell him to make
the right choice

03:14.880 --> 03:16.245
and not just
bend over like that.

03:16.250 --> 03:18.115
Is that what they
taught you in prison?

03:21.500 --> 03:24.037
You know,
Klesco is giving money

03:24.040 --> 03:27.168
to support our arts programs
at the schools?

03:27.170 --> 03:29.070
And they're also gonna be
paving Spring Street

03:29.080 --> 03:30.786
all the way down
to the water.

03:30.790 --> 03:32.872
Yeah. So they can move
their tanker trucks down there.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.324
Look, they're hosting
a little open house

03:34.330 --> 03:36.286
at the community center
for the entire town.

03:36.290 --> 03:37.871
Explaining what
their plans are,

03:37.880 --> 03:39.165
and how they're
gonna help the town.

03:39.170 --> 03:40.956
You should go.

03:40.960 --> 03:43.531
Might help you feel better
about this whole thing.

03:43.540 --> 03:46.282
Yeah. As long as there
are free snow cones.

03:47.920 --> 03:49.035
This one.

03:49.040 --> 03:51.031
-[wincing] Oh!
-Hey. Hey.

03:51.040 --> 03:52.280
You okay?

03:52.290 --> 03:53.279
Mom?

03:55.170 --> 03:56.660
It's been happening lately.

03:58.250 --> 03:59.877
Can I get you something?

03:59.880 --> 04:02.997
A stiff martini
and a new L-5 vertebrae.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.036
-Mom.
-Look, don't worry, okay?
I'll be fine.

04:05.040 --> 04:07.201
I'm going to see
a specialist next week.

04:09.790 --> 04:11.576
Your father
pulled some strings.

04:18.580 --> 04:20.320
[male oil engineer]
Aft thrusters up to 80%.

04:21.540 --> 04:23.610
Drill string
at 350 meters.

04:23.620 --> 04:25.781
Pick up the pace out there,
ya grannies.

04:27.580 --> 04:30.879
[workers shouting
over din of equipment]

04:38.460 --> 04:40.325
[soft jazz playing]

04:40.330 --> 04:43.822
This is the drill string
that pokes into the sea floor.

04:43.830 --> 04:46.788
It allows us to pull up
a core sample that,

04:46.790 --> 04:51.329
fingers crossed,
confirms the presence
of a great big oil deposit.

04:51.330 --> 04:52.615
I can show you
some of the cool things

04:52.620 --> 04:54.167
that Klesco is planning
for your town.

04:54.170 --> 04:55.239
Right this way.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.036
Quite a show
they're putting on.

04:59.040 --> 05:03.079
Yeah. Pave a few streets,
give 'em some popcorn,

05:03.080 --> 05:04.069
makes it all okay.

05:05.960 --> 05:07.166
This isn't to scale.

05:08.540 --> 05:10.872
It's actually
over 800 meters long.

05:13.040 --> 05:15.281
You know what kind
of leverage that generates?

05:23.040 --> 05:24.200
I know what we can do.

05:27.040 --> 05:28.325
[thermometer beeps]

05:30.670 --> 05:32.069
This takes
your temperature.

05:34.040 --> 05:35.075
[beep]

05:36.120 --> 05:37.109
[beeping]

05:39.080 --> 05:40.240
92.2?

05:44.000 --> 05:45.410
She doesn't feel cold.

05:45.420 --> 05:48.036
Yeah. Must be well insulated.

05:48.040 --> 05:49.917
-See, that wasn't so bad.
-[cell phone buzzing]

06:00.750 --> 06:02.536
-Just a slight pinch.
-Wait!

06:02.540 --> 06:03.529
-[growls]
-[groaning]

06:03.540 --> 06:05.417
-Aah!
-Aw, damn!

06:05.420 --> 06:08.821
It's okay, it was a mistake.
Are you okay?

06:08.830 --> 06:11.207
-[gasp51
-No needles.
I told them that.

06:11.210 --> 06:12.074
[clattering]

06:13.790 --> 06:17.032
Uh, they also want me
to X-Ray and MRI.

06:17.040 --> 06:19.531
Maybe next time.
We're gonna take this
nice and slow.

06:21.500 --> 06:22.569
Ben.

06:22.580 --> 06:24.491
[soft jazz playing]

06:24.500 --> 06:26.161
Oh, hey. Ian.

06:26.170 --> 06:27.740
This is Maddie.
Maddie, this is Ian.

06:27.750 --> 06:30.287
-Nice to meet you.
-Hi.

06:30.290 --> 06:32.576
I was not expecting
to see you back here.

06:32.580 --> 06:34.286
[chuckles]
Yeah. Me, neither.

06:34.290 --> 06:36.781
Klesco's got this black tie
event this weekend,

06:36.790 --> 06:38.166
there's press and VIPs.

06:38.170 --> 06:39.660
Live feed, the whole deal.

06:40.750 --> 06:41.819
My mom didn't mention it.

06:41.830 --> 06:44.037
Shocker.

06:44.040 --> 06:45.280
Hats?

06:45.290 --> 06:46.575
[Ian] Nah, I'm okay.

06:46.580 --> 06:48.116
-[Maddie] We're good.
-Yeah.

06:48.120 --> 06:50.111
-Hats?
-Thank you.

06:50.120 --> 06:52.998
Follow me. [chuckles]

06:53.000 --> 06:55.286
Yeah, I was a little surprised
to get the invite myself.

06:55.290 --> 06:56.826
They kill
my investigative story,

06:56.830 --> 06:58.570
and then bring me out
for this publicity stunt?

06:58.580 --> 07:01.162
I don't know whether
they're arrogant or Ignorant.

07:01.170 --> 07:02.614
Probably both.

07:02.620 --> 07:03.917
Check this out.

07:06.250 --> 07:07.239
What's that?

07:07.250 --> 07:08.706
The invite they sent us.

07:08.710 --> 07:10.871
Like we're employees
or something.

07:10.880 --> 07:14.031
You said there's gonna be
a live feed at the event?
Of what?

07:14.040 --> 07:16.167
I guess it's the core sample
coming up on the drillship,

07:16.170 --> 07:18.240
proving there's oil
down there for real.

07:22.380 --> 07:24.029
You mind if I borrow this?

07:24.040 --> 07:25.917
[Ben] We need
to get you back home.

07:25.920 --> 07:27.456
In the ocean.
And we need to do it now.

07:27.460 --> 07:30.418
First step, we gotta
take out the sonic cannon,

07:30.420 --> 07:32.411
make the noise go away.

07:33.460 --> 07:35.075
It's around here.

07:35.080 --> 07:36.490
[Maddie]
Ben and I can do that...

07:36.500 --> 07:38.115
we think.

07:38.120 --> 07:39.371
But that's not enough.

07:39.380 --> 07:40.699
They'll just bring
in a new one.

07:40.710 --> 07:42.780
We have to do more,
something big,

07:42.790 --> 07:45.031
to make them
go away for good.

07:45.040 --> 07:46.029
So your home is safe.

07:46.040 --> 07:47.075
Yes.

07:47.080 --> 07:49.207
We have an idea.

07:49.210 --> 07:51.496
This is
the Klesco drillship.

07:51.500 --> 07:54.572
We cut the string
at its base,

07:54.580 --> 07:55.990
and then we're gonna
pull it out.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.160
Oh, jeez.

07:57.170 --> 08:00.162
How are you planning
to do that?

08:00.170 --> 08:01.068
They're gonna do it.

08:03.670 --> 08:07.322
Once the cannon is off,
they can swim down and cut it.

08:07.330 --> 08:09.241
You pull that drill string,
it's gonna do some damage.

08:09.250 --> 08:12.162
Yeah, that's kinda the idea.

08:12.170 --> 08:13.114
Yeah, but how
you gonna pull it?

08:13.120 --> 08:15.111
We're gonna use your trawl net.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.280
You can't.

08:16.290 --> 08:17.279
It's barely 1,200 feet.

08:17.290 --> 08:18.279
It's not long enough.

08:18.290 --> 08:20.110
That's all we got.

08:20.120 --> 08:21.246
I'll buy you a new one.

08:22.380 --> 08:24.780
From my trust account.

08:24.790 --> 08:27.281
That's why we took it out,
for them.

08:27.290 --> 08:29.201
Thank you, Helen.

08:29.210 --> 08:30.950
When do we do this?

08:30.960 --> 08:33.076
There's an event
on Friday night,

08:33.080 --> 08:34.957
press, oil execs,
they're all gonna be there.

08:34.960 --> 08:37.531
They'll be watching
a live feed of the extraction.

08:37.540 --> 08:40.168
They'll bring the cameras,
we'll give 'em the show.

08:41.500 --> 08:43.161
What do you need me to do?

08:43.170 --> 08:45.035
[Ben] You're gonna put on
your nicest evening dress,

08:45.040 --> 08:46.951
drink expensive champagne,

08:46.960 --> 08:49.326
and make sure that everybody
is watching that monitor.

08:49.330 --> 08:51.286
Yeah. I can do that.

08:51.290 --> 08:52.917
Good.

08:57.120 --> 09:01.079
Ryn, you weren't
at the apartment earlier
when I came by.

09:01.080 --> 09:02.320
Did you go out?

09:03.670 --> 09:05.035
I go for a walk.

09:06.460 --> 09:08.030
To think.

09:08.040 --> 09:10.031
A thinking walk.

09:10.040 --> 09:15.068
Hey, I-- I just want to make
sure that they're up for this.

09:15.080 --> 09:16.570
It's dangerous.

09:16.580 --> 09:20.209
In water, always danger.

09:20.210 --> 09:21.199
Never safe.

09:23.170 --> 09:24.455
You're okay with this?

09:28.670 --> 09:30.991
We don't want
this big fight.

09:33.170 --> 09:34.410
But we must.

09:35.670 --> 09:36.989
So we can go back home.

09:41.960 --> 09:44.201
[seagulls calling]

09:45.540 --> 09:47.326
You switchin'
to long lining, huh?

09:48.460 --> 09:50.746
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

09:50.750 --> 09:54.038
2,500 hooks, shortened up
to three and a quarter miles.

09:54.040 --> 09:55.029
That's the legal limit
nowadays.

09:56.670 --> 09:57.989
Should be plenty.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.116
Yeah. Uh-huh.

10:05.500 --> 10:07.456
-Hey, can you grab that?
-Yeah.

10:13.250 --> 10:14.319
Right.

10:16.120 --> 10:17.997
[whirring]

10:18.000 --> 10:20.321
-What are those?
-[Ben] DPVs.

10:20.330 --> 10:24.369
Hopefully they're get us
to the sonic cannon
before it goes boom.

10:24.380 --> 10:26.575
That is so James Bond.

10:26.580 --> 10:29.413
I mean, you know,
circa 1974.

10:29.420 --> 10:31.035
If they actually work.

10:31.040 --> 10:33.998
I got my dad's torch
from the boat.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.036
There's no guarantees
it'll work, either, but...

10:36.040 --> 10:39.612
So you guys think
we really have a chance
of pulling this off?

10:41.330 --> 10:43.116
Come on, Xan.

10:43.120 --> 10:44.747
I mean, we got mermaids

10:44.750 --> 10:46.115
with blowtorches.

10:48.750 --> 10:50.115
[hissing]

10:50.120 --> 10:51.200
Fire.

10:52.380 --> 10:55.110
Yes. But this_fire
IS very speCIal.

10:55.120 --> 10:56.530
It works in the water.

11:00.380 --> 11:02.245
So we'll use
this fire to cut.

11:06.080 --> 11:08.036
You'll do this
in the water.

11:18.080 --> 11:19.661
Hey, Sarge.

11:23.540 --> 11:25.417
Great chat! [laughs]

11:25.420 --> 11:27.115
So is he
your plus one or... ?

11:28.750 --> 11:31.378
Unfortunately, he's got
other plans tomorrow.

11:33.290 --> 11:35.872
[machinery whirring]

11:40.620 --> 11:44.033
Hey, you know,
now that we got this line,

11:44.040 --> 11:45.746
we could actually use it.

11:45.750 --> 11:48.492
Go out further, catch
some bigger money fish.

11:48.500 --> 11:51.037
Don't _know.
Longer trIps, It's more fuel.

11:51.040 --> 11:53.611
You gotta spend money
to make money, brah.

11:53.620 --> 11:55.417
This could be huge for us.

11:55.420 --> 11:56.910
-Yeah?
-[boat horn blows]

11:56.920 --> 11:58.239
Maybe, right?

11:58.250 --> 12:00.161
Hell, yeah.

12:00.170 --> 12:01.910
We go after
the bigger markets,

12:01.920 --> 12:04.377
Seattle, maybe
get some cash flow
going and then--

12:04.380 --> 12:06.416
Oh! [grunts]

12:06.420 --> 12:07.956
Shit!

12:07.960 --> 12:10.201
-Whoa! Whoa whoa!
-[groaning]

12:10.210 --> 12:11.529
Hold on, I got you!
Stay still!

12:11.540 --> 12:12.700
Stay still, man!
I got you!

12:12.710 --> 12:14.109
-I got it.
-Ohh!

12:14.120 --> 12:15.417
You okay? You all right?

12:15.420 --> 12:16.785
Yeah, it's just jacket.

12:22.380 --> 12:24.951
[female technician]
Drill fluid at 500 psi.

12:24.960 --> 12:26.530
C'mon, boys, push it!

12:26.540 --> 12:28.030
We gotta break
through this shale.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.116
[grinding]

12:35.210 --> 12:37.326
[pipe clanging]

12:37.330 --> 12:39.036
We do this.

12:40.170 --> 12:41.068
Amazing.

12:46.040 --> 12:48.167
They can do it
in human form,

12:48.170 --> 12:50.286
but will they be able
to do it when they're
in the water?

12:50.290 --> 12:53.168
They're less predictable
in that state.

12:53.170 --> 12:54.956
We don't have a choice.

12:54.960 --> 12:56.370
They're the only ones
that can go that deep.

12:56.380 --> 12:58.575
In water,
we are more animal.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.069
We need this to survive.

13:01.080 --> 13:02.160
Of course.

13:02.170 --> 13:04.491
And I know
you can do this job.

13:04.500 --> 13:05.876
You've changed.

13:05.880 --> 13:08.701
No, Maddie.
I am animal, too.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.240
I see you denied
our request

13:15.250 --> 13:18.117
for a blood draw
and further scans.

13:18.120 --> 13:20.577
We need to take our time,
build trust with her.

13:20.580 --> 13:22.491
I respect your desire
to keep this

13:22.500 --> 13:24.707
a pleasant experience
for the subject, but--

13:24.710 --> 13:26.780
Sir, it's not
about being pleasant.

13:26.790 --> 13:28.280
She pushed him so hard
when she saw the needle,

13:28.290 --> 13:29.826
he stabbed himself.

13:29.830 --> 13:32.207
Sounds like she
should have been restrained.

13:32.210 --> 13:35.077
How'd that work
with the other one you caught?

13:38.080 --> 13:39.616
We need to keep
this moving.

13:39.620 --> 13:41.611
There is a lot
on the research agenda.

13:41.620 --> 13:44.498
What exactly are we
gonna be doing with her?

13:44.500 --> 13:47.116
Well, that's above
your security clearance.

13:59.250 --> 14:00.285
[Helen] Hey.

14:00.290 --> 14:02.781
Is everything okay?

14:02.790 --> 14:05.577
Yeah.
They'll be going away.

14:05.580 --> 14:06.956
Back home.

14:08.040 --> 14:10.281
He's one. There's men?

14:11.880 --> 14:13.245
Of course there's men.

14:13.250 --> 14:16.413
Um... how long
are they gonna be gone for?

14:18.170 --> 14:19.159
I don't know.

14:20.170 --> 14:22.161
Awhile.

14:22.170 --> 14:24.070
Maybe forever.

14:24.080 --> 14:26.071
It's where they belong.

14:28.080 --> 14:31.993
I thought you might want
to see them once more
before they leave.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.288
I guess it's
just back to my stupid,
meaningless life, huh?

14:50.040 --> 14:52.201
[Helen]
We're all connected.

14:52.210 --> 14:55.168
Just because they're gone
doesn't change that.

14:58.960 --> 15:00.200
[soft hiss]

15:04.330 --> 15:06.036
[Ryn] One more day.

15:06.040 --> 15:09.874
Then we go back in water,
back home.

15:12.040 --> 15:14.577
We look
for the others we lose.

15:16.170 --> 15:17.614
We are family again.

15:19.210 --> 15:21.997
And we say thank you

15:24.670 --> 15:27.161
to the humans
who protect us,

15:27.170 --> 15:28.614
keep us safe.

15:34.540 --> 15:37.077
[Ben] Hopefully one day
our species can all
live together,

15:38.580 --> 15:40.241
in peace.
No more fights.

15:42.830 --> 15:44.661
We should get them back,

15:44.670 --> 15:46.035
get some rest for tomorrow.

15:46.040 --> 15:49.032
They will stay here.
Together.

15:49.040 --> 15:51.076
One last slumber party.

15:51.080 --> 15:52.661
Yeah, it's probably good
for them to be together.

15:53.960 --> 15:55.780
Be ready to roll
in the morning.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.871
Are you gonna stay here?

16:02.880 --> 16:05.030
Yes. I will stay.

16:12.880 --> 16:14.450
Calvin!

16:14.460 --> 16:16.951
[rock music playing in bar]

16:16.960 --> 16:18.109
Wait wait wait wait wait.

16:19.420 --> 16:21.615
Hey, um...

16:21.620 --> 16:23.497
I know
I don't say this a lot,

16:23.500 --> 16:24.489
but...

16:26.040 --> 16:27.280
I really love you.

16:28.670 --> 16:30.456
You say it,
like, 20 times a day.

16:30.460 --> 16:34.749
Yeah, but it's
usually like, "I love ya."

16:34.750 --> 16:37.207
You know? Not...

16:38.750 --> 16:39.990
"I love you."

16:41.250 --> 16:42.990
What's with all the mush?

16:43.000 --> 16:44.820
Is there something
you're not telling me?

16:44.830 --> 16:46.070
No.

16:46.080 --> 16:48.116
You and Xan
are just going fishing?

16:48.120 --> 16:49.530
Mm-hmm.

16:49.540 --> 16:52.498
[male singer]
Come on, yeah, yeah

16:52.500 --> 16:54.912
Lord have mercy

16:54.920 --> 16:56.911
Hey.

16:56.920 --> 16:59.115
Where'd Calvin go?

16:59.120 --> 17:00.417
He's with Janine.

17:00.420 --> 17:01.910
Where you been?

17:01.920 --> 17:04.115
What do you mean?

17:04.120 --> 17:05.997
I just tried
calling you earlier.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.285
I thought maybe you left.

17:07.290 --> 17:09.167
Why would you think that?

17:09.170 --> 17:12.116
I don't know, just

17:12.120 --> 17:13.701
_ wasn't sure
If your work was done.

17:13.710 --> 17:15.325
What are you talking about?

17:20.000 --> 17:21.285
You know,
I never got to thank you.

17:22.620 --> 17:24.076
For gettin' us outta jail?

17:27.210 --> 17:29.201
and you're military.

17:29.210 --> 17:30.279
Hey, yeah

17:30.290 --> 17:31.996
Lord have mercy

17:32.000 --> 17:32.989
Somebody tell you this?

17:33.000 --> 17:35.412
You got the best of me

17:35.420 --> 17:39.413
I'm a smelly,
barely-employed,
semi-alcoholic fisherman.

17:40.790 --> 17:42.200
You, you come
from outta nowhere,

17:42.210 --> 17:44.201
just way outta my league,
all into me.

17:45.790 --> 17:47.576
Come on, wasn't that hard
to figure out.

17:47.580 --> 17:49.571
And was sleeping with me
part of the job?

17:49.580 --> 17:50.615
No.

17:52.500 --> 17:54.491
I came up with that
all on my own.

17:54.500 --> 17:55.535
Hey.

17:57.540 --> 17:58.996
What's your end game?

18:01.080 --> 18:02.911
Oh, baby

18:04.460 --> 18:08.032
Baby,
Lord have mercy on me

18:08.040 --> 18:10.417
Lord have mercy

18:10.420 --> 18:12.820
You got the best of me

18:12.830 --> 18:14.821
[crickets chirping]

18:44.210 --> 18:46.030
[sighs]

18:46.040 --> 18:49.203
You don't have
to stand there.

18:49.210 --> 18:51.075
If you're gonna be
my night watchman,

18:51.080 --> 18:52.877
at least have a seat.

18:53.920 --> 18:55.069
Sit.

18:55.080 --> 18:56.707
Be comfortable.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.160
That's better.

19:06.170 --> 19:07.819
You won't be coming back.

19:09.540 --> 19:10.575
I know.

19:36.210 --> 19:37.029
For you.

19:40.080 --> 19:41.957
So you remember me.

19:49.750 --> 19:51.240
Did you flush the regulators?

19:51.250 --> 19:52.285
They're good to go.

19:54.460 --> 19:56.109
[door opens]

20:01.330 --> 20:03.070
-Ryn.
-Everything okay?

20:05.250 --> 20:08.663
I want to spend
this night with you.

20:14.170 --> 20:16.070
We're glad you came.

20:16.080 --> 20:17.286
We were missing you.

20:22.120 --> 20:23.246
You are afraid.

20:25.250 --> 20:28.117
Yeah. It's a big thing
we're doing.

20:30.080 --> 20:31.786
I am afraid.

20:31.790 --> 20:33.075
You are?

20:43.290 --> 20:44.666
When I go back,

20:45.670 --> 20:47.456
what if I am not the same?

20:49.080 --> 20:52.243
What if I forget
how to survive.

20:52.250 --> 20:55.492
Ryn, you're so strong.

20:56.500 --> 20:57.706
You're going to be okay.

20:58.960 --> 21:00.200
We believe that.

21:00.210 --> 21:02.166
And after
you find the others,

21:02.170 --> 21:03.660
the ones that are lost,

21:03.670 --> 21:05.376
you'll just
come back here, right?

21:05.380 --> 21:06.415
Yes, Ben.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.456
Maybe.

21:12.540 --> 21:13.950
There's a chance you won't?

21:17.170 --> 21:19.411
["Don't Trust Myself"
by Robinson playing]

21:19.420 --> 21:21.160
Ryn always with you.

21:23.880 --> 21:24.949
We love you.

21:26.580 --> 21:28.457
And when you held me

21:28.460 --> 21:30.746
I know in the moment I was

21:30.750 --> 21:33.036
Fallin' from heaven

21:33.040 --> 21:35.031
I want to believe
In somethIng

21:35.040 --> 21:37.247
Something so different

21:37.250 --> 21:39.992
I'm stuck
in the fever of us

21:40.000 --> 21:41.115
Mm

21:41.120 --> 21:42.667
You want?

21:42.670 --> 21:44.160
Overrated

21:44.170 --> 21:46.161
And when I found you

21:46.170 --> 21:47.740
I put my arms around you

21:47.750 --> 21:48.876
Show me.

21:48.880 --> 21:50.416
Wanna feel special

21:50.420 --> 21:52.741
Like the way
that I'm supposed to

21:52.750 --> 21:53.785
Feel on my own

21:53.790 --> 21:55.997
I feel so alone

21:56.000 --> 21:58.036
I want you to go

21:58.040 --> 21:59.871
I can't get

You out of my brain

Ooh-hoo—oooh

22:17.210 --> 22:19.417
I don't trust myself

22:19.420 --> 22:21.411
I'm under your spell

22:21.420 --> 22:23.069
Oh, baby

22:23.080 --> 22:25.992
You must be
full of yourself

22:29.250 --> 22:30.877
This is where love comes from?

We make it.

22:35.080 --> 22:36.035
Yeah.

22:37.670 --> 22:40.707

we want to be touched

22:40.710 --> 22:42.917
and kissed.

Neck. Maybe.

22:47.420 --> 22:49.240
-Okay.
- I wanna believe in you

But you are
no different, baby

in the fever of us

I drink up all my money

of yourself

I haven't worn this thing
since you dragged me

24:27.830 --> 24:29.036
to that opera gala last year.

24:44.830 --> 24:46.491
It's still happening?

24:46.500 --> 24:49.071
Okay. Look, uh,
just try and relax.

24:49.080 --> 24:51.036
I'm gonna
lift you a little bit.

-Sorry, baby.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.991
[groans]

24:56.000 --> 24:58.161
I'm gonna move up that meeting
with the neurologist.

24:59.790 --> 25:03.078
I wonder if it has
something to do

25:03.080 --> 25:06.572
with the treatment
from the clinical trial?

25:06.580 --> 25:08.070
We don't know
what they're giving me.

25:08.080 --> 25:10.492
We'll figure it all out,
I promise.

25:10.500 --> 25:11.990
If you wanna pass
on tonight,

25:12.000 --> 25:13.661
I'm sure I can
get Sylvia over here.

25:13.670 --> 25:16.116
No. I have pills.

25:18.670 --> 25:20.490
I'll manage.

25:20.500 --> 25:23.287
Well, it'd be a shame to have
these earrings go to waste.

26:27.210 --> 26:29.531
[jazz combo playing]

26:51.460 --> 26:53.030
Uh, Mr. Pownall.

26:53.040 --> 26:56.168
Hi. I'm Ian Sutton,
KFGT News.

26:56.170 --> 26:57.319
Ben mentioned you.

26:57.330 --> 26:59.036
Yeah, I was hoping
to get a quote from you

26:59.040 --> 27:01.372
about Klesco's impact
on the local fishing industry,

27:01.380 --> 27:03.200
especially its effect
on sea life.

27:04.920 --> 27:06.535
This is supposed
to be a nice evening.

27:06.540 --> 27:08.280
Well, I'm being nice.

27:08.290 --> 27:09.746
Well, Ian,

27:11.080 --> 27:13.617
we value our natural
resources around here,

27:13.620 --> 27:16.748
and we're utterly confident
Klesco will be taking
every safety precaution

27:16.750 --> 27:19.287
to ensure a minimal impact
on our environment.

27:19.290 --> 27:22.032
Yet their initial exploration
has already been linked

27:22.040 --> 27:23.951
to the beaching
of several whales in the area.

27:28.170 --> 27:29.205
This is a celebration.

27:30.540 --> 27:32.076
I hope you're able
to enjoy yourself.

27:36.710 --> 27:40.328
[ominous music playing]

27:40.330 --> 27:42.241
[indistinct shouts]

27:49.330 --> 27:50.820
[man]
Ready on the elevator.

27:52.540 --> 27:55.111
Lift drill string
to 15 meters below sea floor.

27:55.120 --> 27:57.327
[man on intercom] Copy that,
drill string at 15 meters.

27:58.830 --> 28:00.741
Standby for extraction.

28:08.670 --> 28:10.035
Hey, Ben.

28:11.120 --> 28:12.075
I gotta tell you something.

28:13.420 --> 28:17.038
What?
I look hot in neoprene?

28:17.040 --> 28:18.416
That goes
without saying, so...

28:18.420 --> 28:19.614
What's up?

28:22.080 --> 28:24.207
When the military
freed us from jail,

28:24.210 --> 28:25.916
we were wondering
how they got in so fast?

28:25.920 --> 28:27.114
Yeah?

28:27.120 --> 28:28.951
[sighs]

28:28.960 --> 28:30.200
They were here all along.

28:32.330 --> 28:34.070
I was sleeping with them.

28:34.080 --> 28:35.115
Nicole?

28:36.420 --> 28:38.115
Yeah.

28:38.120 --> 28:39.200
Shit.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.536
She say what she wants?

28:42.540 --> 28:43.780
Well, them, I guess.

28:44.960 --> 28:47.918
[alert beeping]

28:49.960 --> 28:51.370
[Ben] All right,
this is as close as we get.

28:53.120 --> 28:54.417
Lights out.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.069
It's time.

29:12.040 --> 29:13.450
[monitor beeping]

29:16.000 --> 29:17.035
Xander?

29:17.040 --> 29:19.201
_ So when
It's red or yellow,

29:19.210 --> 29:21.781
that means
that the noise is bad.

29:21.790 --> 29:23.246
You'll know that
we shut down the cannon

29:23.250 --> 29:25.036
when the light
goes green, okay?

29:25.040 --> 29:26.450
That's when it's safe
to go In the water.

29:27.460 --> 29:28.666
Green we go.

29:30.880 --> 29:31.949
What is green?

29:31.960 --> 29:34.167
[Xander]
Uh, it's a...

29:34.170 --> 29:35.455
It's a color?

29:35.460 --> 29:36.870
I'll show ya.

29:37.880 --> 29:41.031
Ben has tail.

29:41.040 --> 29:43.452
Yeah, not quite
as good as yours, though.

29:44.620 --> 29:46.702
Ben.

29:46.710 --> 29:48.200
Levi friend.

30:04.420 --> 30:06.206
I guess this is goodbye.

30:08.040 --> 30:09.166
Ryn is with you.

30:13.580 --> 30:14.911
-You ready?
-Yes.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.786
Ocean is strong.

30:17.790 --> 30:18.779
So are we.

30:18.790 --> 30:20.075
Yeah.

30:20.080 --> 30:22.036
We can do this.

30:34.790 --> 30:35.916
Maddie?

30:38.040 --> 30:40.497
Hey, be safe down there,
all right?

30:40.500 --> 30:41.819
Yeah.

31:04.670 --> 31:07.116
[jazz combo playing]

31:12.960 --> 31:14.109

[Elaine]
Hello, Helen.

31:15.710 --> 31:18.167
I wasn't expecting
to see you here.

31:19.540 --> 31:21.076
You look nice.

31:21.080 --> 31:22.069
Thank you.

31:24.120 --> 31:26.168
And thank you for releasing
my trust funds.

31:27.750 --> 31:30.071
Ben told me _
what you were usmg It for.

31:30.080 --> 31:33.163
I'm sorry to hear
about your health condition.

31:33.170 --> 31:34.819
Autoimmune disorders
can be trIclq,

31:34.830 --> 31:38.743
and I hope that the money
can help you find treatment.

31:40.380 --> 31:43.372
I'm afraid _
my condItIon Is chronIc.

31:43.380 --> 31:47.373
I know what that's like,
obviously.

31:47.380 --> 31:48.745
You're not well.

Thank you all
for coming tonight

31:57.170 --> 31:59.070
to this very special
live event.

31:59.080 --> 32:02.208
As you know, there are
some exciting things

32:02.210 --> 32:04.201
happening in the ocean
as we speak.

32:15.420 --> 32:16.739

[beep]

32:19.170 --> 32:22.207
[shockwave whooshes]

32:30.040 --> 32:32.827
On behalf of my wife Elaine,
and everyone in our town,

32:32.830 --> 32:36.243
I'd like to extend
a warm welcome to you all.

32:36.250 --> 32:38.206
People don't always
agree on things,

32:38.210 --> 32:40.747
but the truth is
our local economy's
been struggling.

32:41.790 --> 32:43.451
I was raised here,

32:43.460 --> 32:47.669
and I care about the people
from my hometown, and if--

32:47.670 --> 32:50.457
when Klesco pulls up oil
in a few moments' time,

32:50.460 --> 32:52.451
it's gonna bring
a lot of opportunity

32:52.460 --> 32:54.200
to the good people
of this region.

32:54.210 --> 32:56.417
Now it's my pleasure
to introduce a man

32:56.420 --> 32:58.570
who's become not just
a business partner of mine,

32:58.580 --> 33:00.161
but also a friend.

33:00.170 --> 33:03.321
The CEO of Klesco Oil,
Mr. Roger Dunn.

They did it.

34:02.540 --> 34:04.997
Okay. Green. We go.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.992
Hey, hey.
Good luck down there, okay?

Do your thing.

34:17.120 --> 34:19.611
Yes, Xander. Bye-bye.

34:31.380 --> 34:35.168
Okay. I'm gonna let
this line out real fast, okay?

34:35.170 --> 34:37.707
Be careful of the hooks.
Sharp. Sharp as hell.

34:52.500 --> 34:54.991
[machinery whirring]

34:55.000 --> 34:58.117
This is the moment
we've all been waItIng for.

34:58.120 --> 35:02.159

that the extraction has begun.

This is a live feed
from our drillship

35:08.880 --> 35:11.110
just offshore here.

35:11.120 --> 35:13.827
As a special surprise,
we've also mounted

35:13.830 --> 35:16.207
a camera
at the drill site itself.

35:16.210 --> 35:17.666
[crowd gasps]

35:17.670 --> 35:21.788
This is 800 meters
at the bottom of the ocean.

35:23.830 --> 35:24.990
Incredible, isn't it?

35:33.620 --> 35:37.989
Increase speed to 400 rpm,
drill fluid at 1,000 psi.

it'll be right back.

36:30.500 --> 36:33.992
Whew. Glad I had
a handyman nearby.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.241
You gonna tell me
what that was about?

36:36.250 --> 36:38.241
A noble cause
for our people.

Mother.

[scraping]

38:00.620 --> 38:02.167
That was an accident.

38:02.170 --> 38:03.569
Okay?

You-- You gotta
let that shit go.

Just in time
for the big event.

Down down down down

40:33.120 --> 40:34.701
Mr. Dunn, can you
give us any sort
of information?

40:34.710 --> 40:35.745
Was this an accident?

40:35.750 --> 40:37.115
We have no comment
on that.

Cut the feed!
