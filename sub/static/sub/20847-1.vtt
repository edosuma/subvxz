00:25.569 --> 00:27.370
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:27.404 --> 00:28.304
I cannot let you do this.

00:28.338 --> 00:30.506
Then you'll have to raise a sword to me,

00:30.540 --> 00:33.809
and that, my father would kill you for.

00:40.083 --> 00:41.350
You came.

00:41.385 --> 00:43.319
I'm here.

00:43.353 --> 00:44.720
I love you.

00:44.755 --> 00:45.821
I love you.

00:48.422 --> 00:51.057
I'm sure as a serving girl,
it must thrill you to no end

00:51.092 --> 00:52.859
to see the rules of Veronan society

00:52.894 --> 00:54.504
flouted before your very eyes.

00:54.539 --> 00:58.131
As it happens, my Lord, I am
both a servant and a Capulet.

00:58.166 --> 00:59.666
You don't approve of this union?

00:59.700 --> 01:01.568
- I do not.
- Nor do I.

01:01.602 --> 01:03.345
Benvolio Montague.

01:04.397 --> 01:05.872
Rosaline Capulet.

01:06.592 --> 01:08.975
Shall we begin?

01:10.244 --> 01:11.745
This is madness, Friar.

01:11.779 --> 01:13.480
I know not why you'd perform a wedding

01:13.514 --> 01:15.138
- between Capulet and Montague.
- Rosaline.

01:15.172 --> 01:17.250
Because I have performed
too many funerals

01:17.285 --> 01:19.186
for both your families this summer.

01:19.220 --> 01:21.321
And who's to say that love won't succeed

01:21.355 --> 01:22.556
where violence has failed?

01:22.921 --> 01:24.558
Come, Romeo, Juliet.

01:24.592 --> 01:28.328
Join hands in front of God
and your witnesses.

01:46.380 --> 01:47.781
I'll tell my father.

01:47.815 --> 01:49.649
And I'll tell mine.

01:59.827 --> 02:01.695
Go now. Tell him it's done.

02:37.665 --> 02:41.401
Y-You made the proclamation?
As I instructed?

02:41.435 --> 02:43.737
That any man accused...

02:43.771 --> 02:45.805
Accused of murder in the city of Verona

02:45.840 --> 02:47.774
will be executed without trial.

02:47.808 --> 02:49.531
I did it. It's done.- -

02:49.565 --> 02:51.745
Father.

02:51.779 --> 02:54.180
Escalus, my son.

02:54.215 --> 02:57.911
I came as soon as I heard. I'm so sorry.

02:58.786 --> 03:00.186
For what?

03:00.221 --> 03:01.988
Death comes to us all.

03:05.359 --> 03:06.860
Isabella.

03:06.894 --> 03:09.006
When you marry...

03:09.497 --> 03:11.431
you will strengthen Verona

03:11.465 --> 03:15.135
in the face of all her enemies.

03:15.169 --> 03:16.136
Father...

03:16.170 --> 03:18.305
Listen to me, my son.

03:18.339 --> 03:20.840
It has been a bloody summer.

03:20.875 --> 03:22.876
Worse than any I remember.

03:22.910 --> 03:25.812
Never forget...

03:25.846 --> 03:28.317
that if either house...

03:28.816 --> 03:31.987
is permitted to gain the upper hand,

03:32.593 --> 03:35.561
their next target will be the Crown.

03:35.586 --> 03:40.860
You must always put Verona first.

03:42.730 --> 03:44.097
Yes, Father.

04:26.774 --> 04:28.875
Tybalt hates you more than
the rest of us put together.

04:28.909 --> 04:30.410
I did kill his cousin.

04:30.444 --> 04:31.711
For stealing his horse.

04:31.746 --> 04:33.380
Maybe I should've killed Tybalt, too.

04:33.414 --> 04:34.748
Oh, come, Mercutio.

04:34.782 --> 04:36.750
Does every Capulet
really deserve to die?

04:36.784 --> 04:38.011
Lord Montague.

04:39.120 --> 04:39.919
Ah, Father.

04:39.954 --> 04:41.154
Romeo.

04:42.323 --> 04:43.289
Late night?

04:43.324 --> 04:45.792
A night with friends
is one well spent, indeed.

04:45.826 --> 04:48.628
There's breakfast upstairs.

04:48.662 --> 04:50.930
Enough for you, too, Mercutio.

04:50.965 --> 04:51.965
Thank you, my Lord.

04:51.999 --> 04:53.733
And as for you, nephew,

04:53.768 --> 04:55.635
you broke off your betrothal
to Minola's daughter.

04:55.669 --> 04:56.903
Because I don't love her.

04:58.005 --> 05:00.240
Love?

05:00.274 --> 05:02.142
The Minolas are rich and powerful,

05:02.176 --> 05:04.911
and you were meant to bring
their blood into our house.

05:04.945 --> 05:06.546
But instead, you shamed our family name

05:06.580 --> 05:07.914
with your drinking and your whoring.

05:07.948 --> 05:09.549
If you paid anything for the betrothal,

05:09.583 --> 05:10.784
I'll find a way to repay you.

05:10.818 --> 05:13.053
You have nothing that isn't mine!

05:13.087 --> 05:14.821
My Lord.

05:14.855 --> 05:15.889
Yes, Mauricio?

05:15.923 --> 05:17.384
News from the palace...

05:18.025 --> 05:19.459
Prince Cosimo is dead.

05:29.128 --> 05:31.648
So Escalus will rule Verona...

05:32.540 --> 05:35.241
a young man, untested,

05:35.276 --> 05:37.210
still learning his place on the throne.

05:38.704 --> 05:41.748
If you had a single thought in
that wine-soaked head of yours

05:41.782 --> 05:43.516
for politics, it might occur to you

05:43.551 --> 05:45.919
what an opportunity this is
for House Montague.

05:45.953 --> 05:48.154
But you don't.

05:49.890 --> 05:51.491
Go, Benvolio.

05:51.525 --> 05:53.760
Wash the stink of the night off you.

05:58.666 --> 05:59.966
Escalus and his sister...

06:00.000 --> 06:02.135
They're going to let us go.

06:02.169 --> 06:04.637
They're never going to let us go.

06:04.672 --> 06:06.106
...to bring them to the ball is...

06:06.140 --> 06:08.141
Is what, Giuliana? Compassionate?

06:08.175 --> 06:09.375
They are our nieces.

06:09.410 --> 06:11.678
My brother's children, rest his soul!

06:11.712 --> 06:14.481
And after their parents died,
we took them in.

06:14.515 --> 06:15.582
As servants!

06:15.616 --> 06:17.884
A decision that has
weighed on my soul ever since.

06:17.918 --> 06:19.552
I am lady of this house.

06:19.587 --> 06:21.154
It was not your decision to make.

06:21.188 --> 06:23.523
Do you hear her? She hate us.

06:23.557 --> 06:25.225
She'd rather die than bring us.

06:25.259 --> 06:26.493
Oh, we can hope.

06:26.527 --> 06:28.328
I love that you can always hope.

06:28.362 --> 06:30.063
...if it wasn't for our compassion.

06:30.097 --> 06:32.165
Escalus and his sister
were their friends

06:32.199 --> 06:33.700
- when the girls were at Court.
- And?

06:33.734 --> 06:35.902
A new young prince, properly managed,

06:35.936 --> 06:37.403
could improve our fortunes

06:37.438 --> 06:39.472
and diminish those of the Montagues!

06:39.883 --> 06:41.474
It's just a ball.

06:41.509 --> 06:43.243
Just a ball?

06:43.277 --> 06:44.210
Mm.

06:44.245 --> 06:46.012
It's the prince's ball.

06:46.046 --> 06:46.980
I need a rich husband,

06:47.014 --> 06:49.415
and I'm never going to find him
stuck in here.

06:50.143 --> 06:51.417
And if I don't find a husband

06:51.452 --> 06:53.586
who'll pay your bride price and mine,

06:53.621 --> 06:55.555
you'll never get to go be
with your beloved nuns.

06:55.589 --> 06:57.157
I'd hardly call them beloved.

06:57.191 --> 06:59.359
Then why on Earth
do you wish to go join them?

06:59.393 --> 07:02.996
Praying all day
and never having any fun again.

07:03.030 --> 07:04.898
A prayer here and there.

07:04.932 --> 07:07.901
But you don't see the fun
in being your own mistress?

07:07.935 --> 07:11.371
Of reading your own books,
of sleeping in your own bed.

07:11.405 --> 07:13.006
Of never being at the whim
of whichever man

07:13.040 --> 07:14.574
happens to be in charge of you.

07:14.608 --> 07:16.509
A man who might love you,

07:16.544 --> 07:18.745
who might want you to be happy.

07:19.613 --> 07:22.515
His Lordship wants to see you both.

07:29.390 --> 07:31.191
You requested us, my Lord?

07:33.761 --> 07:36.963
It is a great kindness
we show you tonight

07:36.997 --> 07:39.432
to allow you
to attend the Prince's ball.

07:39.466 --> 07:40.900
Really?

07:40.935 --> 07:43.937
Mother, Father.

07:43.971 --> 07:45.592
Rosaline, Livia.

07:45.626 --> 07:47.826
Darling, why aren't you dressed
for the ball?

07:50.778 --> 07:52.078
You look tired.

07:52.112 --> 07:53.980
I am... tired.

07:55.850 --> 07:57.150
Ill.

07:57.184 --> 07:59.552
I thought I would get some rest.

07:59.587 --> 08:01.721
What a shame.

08:01.755 --> 08:04.090
Very well. We'll miss you.

08:04.124 --> 08:05.592
Do you need help, my Lady?

08:05.626 --> 08:07.594
No, thank you, Rosaline. I'm fine.

08:07.628 --> 08:10.196
Tired... but fine.

08:15.336 --> 08:16.869
I'll tell them later.

09:12.493 --> 09:14.260
Lord Capulet.

09:16.096 --> 09:18.131
Lord Montague.

09:18.165 --> 09:19.899
So, it's true.

09:19.933 --> 09:23.296
The Prince really did invite everyone.

09:25.521 --> 09:27.507
It's worse than it's ever been.

09:27.541 --> 09:30.512
Montagues and Capulets
have always fought.

09:31.031 --> 09:32.665
Not like this, Brother.

09:32.690 --> 09:34.525
Never like this.

09:34.605 --> 09:36.739
Capulet's fields were burned in June.

09:36.774 --> 09:39.409
No proof, of course,
but it was Montague's work.

09:39.443 --> 09:40.810
It goes on from there.

09:40.844 --> 09:43.546
A Capulet stabs a Montague
in the streets,

09:43.581 --> 09:46.382
a Montague bludgeons a Capulet
in the hills.

09:46.417 --> 09:47.684
Until our father proclaimed...

09:47.718 --> 09:51.154
That anyone who commits murder
will be executed without trial.

09:51.188 --> 09:54.157
I am well aware
of what Father proclaimed.

09:54.191 --> 09:58.094
But Father is dead, and I've come home.

09:59.430 --> 10:01.831
The sovereign of our fair Verona,

10:01.865 --> 10:03.132
His Grace, Prince Escalus

10:03.167 --> 10:06.669
and his sister, Her Grace,
Princess Isabella!

10:18.048 --> 10:20.984
Thank you, Your Grace,
for this beautiful night.

10:21.018 --> 10:22.752
You're welcome, Livia.

10:22.786 --> 10:23.953
Enjoy.

10:27.157 --> 10:30.426
Greetings, My Princess.

10:30.461 --> 10:33.363
You know you don't have to be so formal.

10:33.397 --> 10:34.464
Really?

10:34.498 --> 10:35.965
I thought everything in this court

10:36.000 --> 10:36.799
was about following rules.

10:36.834 --> 10:39.135
- Rosaline...
- Thank you, Your Grace,

10:39.169 --> 10:41.971
for giving your loyal subjects
this ball.

10:47.077 --> 10:49.646
It's good to see you
back in Verona, Your Grace.

10:50.357 --> 10:51.843
Rosaline.

10:54.318 --> 10:56.185
Prince Escalus.

10:56.220 --> 10:58.821
How disconcerting this must be.

10:58.856 --> 11:02.724
When last you saw my niece,
Rosaline, she was your peer.

11:02.749 --> 11:04.950
She is my guest,

11:04.975 --> 11:07.066
and a welcome one here at the palace.

11:10.834 --> 11:14.203
I was so sorry to hear
of your parents' deaths.

11:15.074 --> 11:16.706
Thank you, Your Grace.

11:24.348 --> 11:27.417
Aren't you even the least bit excited

11:27.451 --> 11:30.486
to dance and drink and do as we please?

11:30.521 --> 11:32.221
Not quite as we please.

11:32.256 --> 11:36.192
Unlike you, sweet sister,
the idea of finding a husband

11:36.226 --> 11:38.161
doesn't actually displease me.

11:38.195 --> 11:42.477
Somewhere out here is my one true love.

11:43.267 --> 11:44.100
What if we meet a man

11:44.134 --> 11:46.932
who falls in love with you instead?

11:46.966 --> 11:49.405
Would you marry so
we could both be free?

11:49.440 --> 11:52.675
That is not a question
that I'll ever have to answer.

11:52.710 --> 11:54.239
And why not?

11:55.412 --> 11:58.214
Because if the choice
were between the two of us,

11:58.248 --> 12:00.583
sweet sister, there's not
a man on this earth

12:00.617 --> 12:02.652
who would be foolish enough
to choose me.

12:09.560 --> 12:12.528
I thought we'd start out with
the taverns on Via Fratta.

12:12.563 --> 12:15.231
After that, there's a new girl
at Angioletta's.

12:15.265 --> 12:17.200
That is if your father
won't kill me first

12:17.234 --> 12:18.968
for taking you to a brothel.

12:19.002 --> 12:21.641
Men who love their wives
don't go to brothels.

12:22.272 --> 12:24.640
And just like that,
you ruined your life.

12:24.675 --> 12:25.708
How?

12:25.743 --> 12:27.210
By marrying the woman I love

12:27.244 --> 12:29.112
instead of whoever my father
forced on me?

12:29.146 --> 12:30.733
Look what I found.

12:31.148 --> 12:32.882
A pair of Montagues.

12:32.916 --> 12:35.118
Tybalt, we want no trouble with you.

12:35.152 --> 12:37.120
Trouble is all Verona has

12:37.154 --> 12:39.155
when the Montagues burn our fields

12:39.189 --> 12:41.924
and try and turn themselves
into a respectable family.

12:41.959 --> 12:43.059
You think no one remembers

12:43.093 --> 12:46.295
that your people came from nothing?

13:01.278 --> 13:02.779
I will not fight you, Tybalt.

13:02.813 --> 13:04.247
The Montagues are many things,

13:04.281 --> 13:05.782
but I never thought of them as cowards!

13:05.816 --> 13:08.584
I am no coward. I'm family.

13:08.619 --> 13:11.154
As of tonight, we're family.

13:11.188 --> 13:12.522
I will not fight my own blood.

13:12.556 --> 13:15.024
Your blood is no family of mine!

13:15.058 --> 13:16.159
Romeo!

13:16.193 --> 13:18.361
Mercutio!

13:21.231 --> 13:23.232
- Mercutio!
- No!

13:26.403 --> 13:27.670
You'll die for this.

13:27.704 --> 13:30.606
I thought you said
you couldn't fight me.

13:30.641 --> 13:34.377
Aah!

13:37.481 --> 13:39.282
I changed my mind.

13:42.386 --> 13:44.987
Mercutio.

13:45.022 --> 13:47.290
Mercutio, stay with us. Stay with us.

13:47.324 --> 13:50.313
A plague on both your houses.

13:51.428 --> 13:53.983
Ask for me tomorrow...

13:55.432 --> 13:58.668
and you shall find me a grave man.

14:04.908 --> 14:06.709
Romeo.

14:06.743 --> 14:09.312
What have you done?

14:13.175 --> 14:14.606
Capulets have owned this land

14:14.631 --> 14:17.199
since before there were records to keep.

14:17.233 --> 14:18.834
And Montague's grandfather was nothing

14:18.868 --> 14:21.070
but a shepherd on my family's hills.

14:21.104 --> 14:23.939
Well, a smart shepherd
to save up for his own flock.

14:23.973 --> 14:27.242
Or was my grandfather
a foolish lord to allow it?

14:27.277 --> 14:28.944
What's done is done,

14:28.978 --> 14:30.612
though, in truth, it seems cruel

14:30.647 --> 14:32.548
that so many should die
for our petty squabbles.

14:32.582 --> 14:34.516
Are money and power so petty?

14:35.885 --> 14:38.287
Says the man who comes to give me money

14:38.321 --> 14:41.492
so he may add the power
of my family to his own.

14:42.178 --> 14:45.060
My father is
the Prince of Mantua, my Lord.

14:45.095 --> 14:46.095
I am his heir.

14:46.129 --> 14:47.563
And the Capulet name is older

14:47.597 --> 14:51.233
even than that
of your royal house, Paris.

14:51.267 --> 14:54.236
You think I don't know
what my own blood is worth?

14:54.270 --> 14:57.272
Juliet will be well cared for in Mantua.

15:00.076 --> 15:01.926
I give my consent.

15:02.512 --> 15:04.313
Good morning, Mother.

15:04.347 --> 15:07.116
- Father.
- I'm glad you're in a good mood.

15:07.150 --> 15:08.417
It's a beautiful morning.

15:08.451 --> 15:10.152
And a happy one for you, my daughter.

15:10.186 --> 15:12.221
Your father has arranged
for you to be wed.

15:15.525 --> 15:17.066
Sorry.

15:18.194 --> 15:19.402
Wed?

15:20.196 --> 15:22.064
To Count Paris of Mantua...
a good match.

15:22.098 --> 15:23.665
I cannot marry a man I've never met.

15:23.700 --> 15:25.961
Sweet girl, I know of youth
and inexperience.

15:25.995 --> 15:27.636
It can be frightening
to think of having a husband.

15:27.670 --> 15:28.570
That's...

15:28.605 --> 15:31.106
But the wedding won't be
until the spring.

15:31.141 --> 15:34.417
That's plenty of time
to learn how it all works.

15:36.146 --> 15:38.247
I saw a messenger
leave the house earlier.

15:38.281 --> 15:39.047
What news?

15:39.082 --> 15:40.682
I didn't want to spoil the morning.

15:40.717 --> 15:43.352
Seems Montague's son, Romeo,
has stabbed one of our own

15:43.386 --> 15:44.820
in the streets last night.

15:44.854 --> 15:45.754
What?!

15:45.789 --> 15:47.756
Another Capulet dead
at a Montague's hand?

15:47.791 --> 15:50.692
Justice will be served.
The law is clear.

15:50.727 --> 15:52.861
Young Romeo Montague
will be put to death...

15:52.896 --> 15:54.562
when they catch him.

16:03.206 --> 16:04.339
Find him!

16:04.374 --> 16:07.976
Romeo and Mercutio
were practically brothers.

16:08.011 --> 16:09.178
It shouldn't be a crime

16:09.212 --> 16:11.013
for one to avenge the other's death.

16:11.047 --> 16:12.314
But it is a crime,

16:12.348 --> 16:14.616
and making it one has given us peace.

16:14.651 --> 16:17.953
If Romeo Montague
committed murder on our soil,

16:17.987 --> 16:20.322
then he should be put to death
at the Crown's hand.

16:20.356 --> 16:22.491
There he is!

16:24.194 --> 16:27.229
We have too many enemies
outside our city walls

16:27.263 --> 16:30.732
to turn the families within them
against us.

16:30.767 --> 16:34.002
I cannot simply execute
Lord Montague's only son.

16:34.037 --> 16:36.238
Then what do our laws mean, brother,

16:36.272 --> 16:38.207
if we won't enforce them?

16:42.178 --> 16:44.213
How long will it take
before our own heads

16:44.247 --> 16:46.315
sit on spikes outside the palace walls?

16:50.920 --> 16:54.122
Find me Romeo Montague.

16:57.293 --> 16:59.027
This way!

17:00.964 --> 17:03.699
You can see that
we can't just let him die.

17:04.567 --> 17:07.769
Are you really so caught up
in your own desires

17:07.804 --> 17:09.271
that you care so little
for my happiness?

17:09.305 --> 17:10.239
My own desires?

17:10.272 --> 17:12.374
To marry off Livia.

17:12.407 --> 17:16.377
To join a nunnery, to turn your
back on your own house.

17:16.412 --> 17:17.613
He's my husband!

17:17.646 --> 17:21.022
A secret known only by people
who aren't likely to reveal it.

17:22.285 --> 17:23.785
Paris is said to be a handsome man.

17:23.819 --> 17:27.356
Romeo is a handsome man.

17:27.390 --> 17:29.591
And to be married to two men
at once would be a sin.

17:29.626 --> 17:34.463
There's no sin in being a widow,
and a virgin widow at that.

17:34.497 --> 17:36.265
I'm not...

17:36.914 --> 17:39.034
a virgin.

17:43.973 --> 17:45.707
Do you think me a fool?

17:49.178 --> 17:52.981
I think you are young.

17:53.016 --> 17:55.349
And so is your husband.

17:57.587 --> 18:01.757
In truth, there is only one man
I blame for this.

18:10.833 --> 18:13.034
Take this potion, girl,

18:13.436 --> 18:17.572
and your body will go cold and still

18:17.607 --> 18:20.509
and you will appear to be dead
until you wake

18:20.543 --> 18:23.445
in the Capulet tomb
as if from a pleasant sleep.

18:23.479 --> 18:24.780
Only take one drop.

18:24.814 --> 18:28.483
More than that and you will die.

18:28.518 --> 18:32.854
What dark magic is this, Friar?

18:32.889 --> 18:36.558
It is better, my child,
that you do not ask.

18:39.462 --> 18:42.531
Wait with me.

18:42.565 --> 18:44.199
I'll wait with you.

18:47.337 --> 18:49.371
Fair Rosaline.

18:49.405 --> 18:50.973
Thou art a true friend.

19:30.680 --> 19:34.816
Juliet.

19:34.851 --> 19:36.418
Juliet!

19:39.455 --> 19:42.724
Help us! Somebody, please!

19:42.759 --> 19:44.526
What?!

19:50.967 --> 19:52.434
Benvolio.

19:52.468 --> 19:54.403
Where is Romeo?

19:54.437 --> 19:56.338
I got him a horse, told him to flee,

19:56.372 --> 19:57.873
but once I said his wife was dead,

19:57.907 --> 19:59.674
he rode off into the night.

19:59.709 --> 20:03.145
Just tell me... Where has Romeo gone?

20:36.579 --> 20:38.480
Juliet.

20:39.013 --> 20:40.848
Sweet flower.

20:47.690 --> 20:49.815
Who goes there?

20:54.664 --> 20:56.864
Romeo Montague.

20:58.434 --> 20:59.968
I come to mourn my wife.

21:00.576 --> 21:02.286
Your wife?

21:02.672 --> 21:04.706
She's my fiancée!

21:06.375 --> 21:08.243
No, I assure you, stranger,

21:08.277 --> 21:10.979
Juliet belongs to no man but me.

21:11.013 --> 21:13.281
Why do you lie
about the virtue of the dead?

21:13.316 --> 21:15.083
- Aah!
- That is not a lie!

21:19.021 --> 21:22.524
Juliet is my wife.

21:22.558 --> 21:24.308
Aah!

21:49.064 --> 21:51.466
And with a kiss...

21:56.392 --> 21:58.093
I die.

22:42.905 --> 22:44.906
No, no!

22:58.297 --> 23:01.291
How can it be that
my own daughter is dead

23:01.316 --> 23:03.829
while you and your sister
continue to live?

23:05.854 --> 23:08.288
It is generous of me, is it not,

23:08.323 --> 23:11.290
to allow you to attend
my daughter's funeral?

23:12.060 --> 23:13.917
Is it not?

23:14.627 --> 23:17.129
It's no more
than Juliet would have wanted.

23:17.866 --> 23:18.999
My Lady.

23:19.034 --> 23:21.969
Livia is so very gracious.

23:22.003 --> 23:24.671
But you... You never seem to appreciate

23:24.706 --> 23:27.374
anything I've done for you.

23:31.833 --> 23:34.267
And what exactly have you done for us?

23:38.267 --> 23:40.319
I'm sorry?

23:41.456 --> 23:45.325
You keep us in this house
not out of generosity

23:45.360 --> 23:48.996
but out of jealousy
of a woman who died years ago.

23:51.433 --> 23:54.835
Your mother was a worthless jade.

23:54.869 --> 23:57.337
Because she married
the brother you loved

23:57.372 --> 24:01.075
but wouldn't stoop to wed
because you wanted a title,

24:01.109 --> 24:02.977
if not the man who came with it.

24:03.012 --> 24:06.080
If you think I can't make you suffer

24:06.114 --> 24:09.083
a thousand times more
than you already have,

24:09.117 --> 24:11.919
you've less imagination than I thought.

24:11.953 --> 24:16.190
Mark my words, sweet Rosaline...

24:16.224 --> 24:18.190
the worst is yet to come.

24:20.929 --> 24:22.729
Go now.

24:22.764 --> 24:24.398
I can dress myself.

24:59.968 --> 25:01.468
Lord Montague.

25:06.905 --> 25:09.950
I'm sorry, my Lord, about your son.

25:14.382 --> 25:15.914
Yes.

25:16.551 --> 25:21.476
Yes, m... my son.

25:23.124 --> 25:25.993
Imagine my delight
when I learned that Romeo

25:26.027 --> 25:29.553
and Capulet's daughter
had discovered each other.

25:30.637 --> 25:34.501
It was something I had hoped for
as they came of age,

25:34.536 --> 25:36.203
encouraged, even.

25:36.237 --> 25:37.538
Secretly, of course.

25:37.572 --> 25:41.842
Young love thrives on the illicit,

25:41.876 --> 25:43.610
wouldn't you agree?

25:44.579 --> 25:46.820
Tried to plant a seed.

25:47.613 --> 25:49.883
But I was never certain it would grow.

25:49.918 --> 25:53.987
But grow it did, and so
I paid you to suggest marriage

25:54.022 --> 25:59.026
and to perform that marriage
when my son requested it.

25:59.060 --> 26:03.163
But now is my house strengthened
with Capulet blood?

26:03.198 --> 26:06.833
Will Capulet's daughter
bear Romeo Montague an heir

26:06.868 --> 26:09.570
representing the union
of two great families

26:09.604 --> 26:11.772
under my house's name?

26:13.575 --> 26:15.075
N-No, my Lord.

26:15.109 --> 26:17.559
Why is that, Friar?

26:18.936 --> 26:21.021
Because Romeo...

26:21.549 --> 26:25.419
Your son is dead, my Lord.

26:25.453 --> 26:26.653
Yes.

26:27.855 --> 26:30.557
Yes, my son is dead

26:30.592 --> 26:34.461
because of a potion
you gave that Capulet whore.

27:04.959 --> 27:06.693
We beseech Thee, O Lord,

27:06.728 --> 27:09.129
in Thy infinite mercy,

27:09.163 --> 27:13.233
to have pity on the souls
of these children of Verona,

27:13.268 --> 27:16.994
Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet.

27:18.453 --> 27:22.643
Do Thou who has freed them
from the perils of mortal life

27:22.677 --> 27:26.113
restore them to the portion
of everlasting freedom.

27:33.051 --> 27:35.756
I am aware that the citizens
of our fair city

27:35.790 --> 27:38.759
owe allegiance to one family or another.

27:38.793 --> 27:41.795
I am aware that it is
a Montague or a Capulet

27:41.829 --> 27:44.731
that provides a job,
protects a business,

27:44.766 --> 27:47.134
offers a favor in a time of need.

27:47.168 --> 27:49.803
But it is my wish today that we might

27:49.837 --> 27:53.573
put down our arms in hope
as well as grief.

27:53.608 --> 27:57.311
And so, to mark the grave of Juliet,

27:57.345 --> 28:00.681
fairest flower of our city's youth,

28:00.715 --> 28:04.918
Lord Montague has
generously commissioned a statue

28:04.952 --> 28:08.522
as a gift from his family
to the Capulets...

28:08.556 --> 28:11.258
Aye, to make his house seem important.

28:11.292 --> 28:13.593
...in his sincere hope that the love

28:13.628 --> 28:16.096
between his son and their daughter

28:16.130 --> 28:19.566
will usher in a new era of peace.

28:31.179 --> 28:34.047
A curse on the house of Montague!

28:42.423 --> 28:43.123
No, Livia!

28:43.157 --> 28:46.159
- Livia!
- No!

28:46.194 --> 28:47.928
Livia!

28:49.063 --> 28:50.597
Livia!

28:55.570 --> 28:57.371
Livia!

29:10.017 --> 29:11.551
Aah!

29:17.725 --> 29:19.259
Stay with me, Rosaline.

29:19.293 --> 29:20.360
My men will find us.

29:20.395 --> 29:21.161
I can't. My sister...

29:21.195 --> 29:23.663
Is on her own, wherever she may be.

29:23.698 --> 29:25.766
But you, right now, are safe.

29:25.800 --> 29:28.668
- I can't.
- Stay here, Rosaline.

29:46.062 --> 29:47.562
Montague's lost his sole heir,

29:47.597 --> 29:49.364
Capulet, his daughter

29:49.398 --> 29:51.833
and his chance at Count Paris' fortune.

29:51.868 --> 29:53.368
I know you worry

29:53.402 --> 29:55.837
about the threats outside
the city walls, Brother.

29:55.872 --> 29:59.011
But I beg you to keep
your focus close to home.

29:59.045 --> 30:00.712
I worry about threats outside the city

30:00.747 --> 30:02.547
because I've been outside the city.

30:02.582 --> 30:05.545
It's no fault of mine I've never
been allowed to leave.

30:05.580 --> 30:08.587
No. But let me tell you what
you'd see if you did.

30:08.621 --> 30:10.756
Milan to the west
and Venice to the east,

30:10.790 --> 30:13.358
and between them,
our fair city of Verona...

30:13.393 --> 30:15.260
a jewel just waiting to be taken

30:15.294 --> 30:18.530
by anyone with an army
strong enough to overcome us.

30:18.564 --> 30:21.400
And trust me when I tell you
that if we're attacked

30:21.434 --> 30:24.169
by the Medici or
the Papal States or anyone else,

30:24.203 --> 30:28.185
the quarrels of local families
will mean absolutely nothing.

30:28.875 --> 30:32.544
We must have peace, no matter the cost.

30:33.880 --> 30:37.015
Escalus, Verona is burning.

30:40.987 --> 30:42.788
You saw them wed?!

30:42.822 --> 30:43.955
Did you not see

30:43.990 --> 30:45.924
that Lady Capulet has lost her mind?

30:45.958 --> 30:47.526
We need to leave here.

30:47.560 --> 30:49.194
She told me she plans to make our lives

30:49.228 --> 30:50.762
even more miserable
than they already are.

30:50.797 --> 30:53.432
Our lives or just yours?

30:53.466 --> 30:55.634
The world believes Romeo and Juliet

30:55.668 --> 30:58.303
were a pair of youths
caught up in forbidden passion,

30:58.337 --> 31:00.939
but now you say they were man and wife,

31:00.973 --> 31:04.309
bound by God, with you as their witness?

31:04.343 --> 31:07.713
Because you watched our cousin
marry a Montague

31:07.747 --> 31:10.415
and never thought to say a word to me?

31:10.450 --> 31:12.918
Would you ever have told me your secret?

31:12.952 --> 31:14.319
Sister?

31:14.353 --> 31:15.721
Had they lived, you would've found out.

31:15.755 --> 31:17.122
That is not the point!

31:19.826 --> 31:21.059
You're right.

31:21.446 --> 31:23.114
I should've told you.

31:23.796 --> 31:26.631
And for that, I am sorry.

31:26.666 --> 31:28.900
But it doesn't change the fact
that we must leave.

31:28.935 --> 31:30.836
And where exactly are we going?

31:30.870 --> 31:31.903
Padua?

31:31.938 --> 31:32.938
Mantua?

31:32.972 --> 31:34.239
It's not important.

31:34.273 --> 31:35.974
If we're lucky, they'll think
we've been killed in the riots.

31:36.008 --> 31:38.744
And when Verona thinks
we're dead, then what?

31:38.778 --> 31:39.978
I don't know, but we can't stay here.

31:40.012 --> 31:41.980
I can!

31:42.014 --> 31:44.082
Stay here.

31:44.117 --> 31:48.086
I don't want to start over
in Padua or Mantua.

31:48.121 --> 31:52.519
What I want is what you always
claimed to want for me...

31:53.025 --> 31:56.106
a good marriage to a good man

31:57.230 --> 31:59.651
who'll take care of us both.

32:01.033 --> 32:03.769
I want to be a wife, Rosaline...

32:03.803 --> 32:09.661
a wife and a mother
and a Capulet here in Verona.

32:10.412 --> 32:11.977
My home.

32:15.907 --> 32:17.408
If you want to run away,

32:17.433 --> 32:19.963
I'll tell them any lie you want me to,

32:21.020 --> 32:22.821
but you're going to be running alone.

32:31.230 --> 32:34.800
A messenger came from the palace.

32:43.042 --> 32:45.477
It says you're to go there at once.

32:53.119 --> 32:54.386
Make way!

32:54.420 --> 32:55.887
Steady, lads.

32:55.922 --> 32:58.723
Brace. You've got to brace yourselves.

33:16.042 --> 33:18.376
My Lady! I can take you to safety.

33:18.411 --> 33:20.078
Come. Come.

33:20.112 --> 33:23.181
Hurry. Hurry.

33:23.216 --> 33:24.916
Where are we going?

33:24.951 --> 33:26.384
- Quick, here.
- No!

33:49.475 --> 33:51.576
You!

33:51.611 --> 33:53.645
Aren't you the least bit
grateful, Capulet?

33:53.679 --> 33:55.647
I did just save you.
I was about to save myself.

33:55.681 --> 33:57.048
You were about to die in the street.

33:57.083 --> 33:58.416
I just risked my life for you.

33:58.451 --> 34:00.819
- Why?
- Because you needed my help.

34:00.853 --> 34:03.255
I don't need anyone's help,
least of all yours.

34:03.289 --> 34:05.156
All this is your fault.

34:05.191 --> 34:06.992
How on earth do you blame me?

34:07.026 --> 34:09.895
If you'd calmed Tybalt down
instead of fanning the flames,

34:09.929 --> 34:12.797
or if you'd killed him yourself
instead of letting Romeo do it,

34:12.831 --> 34:14.299
none of this would've happened.

34:14.333 --> 34:16.501
Our city wouldn't be in ruins.

34:16.534 --> 34:18.637
Neither of our families
would've lost their heirs.

34:18.670 --> 34:20.804
Of course it's my fault
Montague and Capulet

34:20.840 --> 34:23.007
only managed to squeeze out
a single child apiece.

34:23.042 --> 34:25.610
And if I'd only thought to
sacrifice my own life.

34:25.645 --> 34:27.279
Did you never think you
could've kept Juliet

34:27.313 --> 34:29.147
from marrying
my cousin in the first place?

34:29.181 --> 34:31.016
Maybe all this is on you.

34:31.050 --> 34:32.484
Maybe.

34:32.518 --> 34:35.587
So I'll not burden you with my presence.

34:35.621 --> 34:38.188
Thank you for saving me. Goodbye.

34:38.224 --> 34:39.891
You're welcome!

35:20.657 --> 35:21.724
Lie still.

35:21.758 --> 35:23.626
It hurts.

35:23.660 --> 35:24.727
Oh, God. It hurts.

35:24.761 --> 35:26.295
You're making it worse.

35:26.330 --> 35:29.699
No. No more.

35:32.069 --> 35:33.636
Romeo.

35:33.670 --> 35:34.704
Romeo.

35:34.738 --> 35:36.706
Juliet is my wife.

35:38.742 --> 35:40.710
Shh. He's dead.

35:40.744 --> 35:43.500
He can't hurt you.

35:45.816 --> 35:46.983
Get out!

35:47.017 --> 35:49.431
Livia, you cannot be here.

35:49.465 --> 35:51.554
Who is he?

35:51.588 --> 35:53.422
None of your concern.

35:53.457 --> 35:54.824
He's dying.

35:54.858 --> 35:56.726
He'll be fine.

35:56.760 --> 35:58.227
He won't be.

35:58.261 --> 36:01.063
I tended to my mother
in her final days, my Lady.

36:01.098 --> 36:03.899
I... know the face of death.

36:03.934 --> 36:06.102
And I know how to care for the sick.

36:06.136 --> 36:07.737
You'll need another pair of hands

36:07.771 --> 36:09.639
if he's to stay alive.

36:12.509 --> 36:14.113
Very well.

36:15.698 --> 36:17.380
If you can keep a secret.

36:19.116 --> 36:22.084
That I can, my Lady.

36:22.119 --> 36:23.452
That I can.

36:48.712 --> 36:52.193
What is the meaning of this?

36:55.475 --> 36:58.182
My niece, I know you haven't

36:58.216 --> 37:00.723
always been well-treated under my roof.

37:00.757 --> 37:04.126
But be honest with me now...
Are you loyal to House Capulet?

37:04.161 --> 37:06.896
I am, Uncle.

37:06.930 --> 37:08.732
And are you loyal to Verona?

37:08.766 --> 37:10.866
Of course, my Lord.

37:11.212 --> 37:12.735
What is this about?

37:12.769 --> 37:15.738
Our city's enemies
are looming at our gates,

37:16.178 --> 37:19.642
and it is time to put aside
local rivalries

37:19.676 --> 37:21.514
for the greater good.

37:26.683 --> 37:28.268
What is the meaning of this?

37:28.302 --> 37:31.420
Hush! Girl.

37:31.455 --> 37:35.524
By royal decree,
I, Escalus, Royal Prince

37:35.559 --> 37:37.993
and sole sovereign of the city of Verona

37:38.028 --> 37:40.096
do herefore order the marriage

37:40.130 --> 37:43.599
of Rosaline Capulet
and Benvolio Montague

37:43.633 --> 37:47.770
to cement your families
as allies, not rivals.

37:47.804 --> 37:51.941
If Montague and Capulet
cannot coexist as two,

37:52.494 --> 37:53.995
they must become one.

37:55.912 --> 37:58.968
Our city's survival depends upon it.

38:00.011 --> 38:02.025
Uncle, her?

38:02.059 --> 38:04.787
You consented to marrying
a Capulet maiden.

38:04.821 --> 38:07.623
A maiden, yes, but not this... harpy.

38:07.657 --> 38:09.258
And I never consented at all.

38:09.292 --> 38:10.860
You will do as you are told.

38:10.894 --> 38:12.795
No, my Lord.

38:13.524 --> 38:15.193
I will not.

38:16.527 --> 38:17.900
Rosaline!

38:17.934 --> 38:19.364
Come back here!

38:21.271 --> 38:23.639
Rosaline!

38:23.673 --> 38:25.407
Rosaline Capulet!

38:25.442 --> 38:27.997
I thought you wouldn't come tonight.

38:30.458 --> 38:32.882
And miss a chance to wish
my Rosaline sweet dreams?

38:38.021 --> 38:39.588
Escalus!

38:43.147 --> 38:45.248
Do you know what my father
would do to you

38:45.273 --> 38:46.640
if he caught you in my room?

38:49.299 --> 38:51.646
Make me marry you.

38:52.791 --> 38:54.292
Help!

38:54.326 --> 38:55.626
What is it? What's happened?

38:55.661 --> 38:57.428
I know not, but begone.

38:58.430 --> 39:00.064
- Livia?
- It's father.

39:00.098 --> 39:01.966
They stabbed him in the streets...

39:02.000 --> 39:03.501
the Montagues!

39:03.535 --> 39:05.603
He's dying!

39:18.383 --> 39:19.632
My Lady.

39:21.119 --> 39:22.753
My Rosaline.

39:22.788 --> 39:24.595
Don't call me that.

39:24.990 --> 39:27.140
Don't talk to me like you care.

39:27.726 --> 39:29.642
Of course I care.

39:30.414 --> 39:32.082
You know I care.

39:32.197 --> 39:33.297
Then how can you do this?

39:33.332 --> 39:36.267
Because the Medici are expanding
their army in Florence.

39:36.301 --> 39:38.936
Because the Papal States grow
more powerful by the day.

39:38.970 --> 39:42.139
Because even Venice would
conquer us given half a chance.

39:42.174 --> 39:44.375
And Montague would have
your head on a spike

39:44.409 --> 39:46.043
given less of a chance than that.

39:46.078 --> 39:47.478
And don't think my uncle is better.

39:47.512 --> 39:49.287
I am no fool.

39:50.015 --> 39:53.451
But we cannot be a city divided.

39:56.054 --> 39:57.962
Whatever the price.

39:58.990 --> 40:01.492
So, you'd sell me off to a man I hate?

40:01.526 --> 40:02.884
Sell you off?

40:03.662 --> 40:07.331
Are you too blind to see
that I'm trying to help you,

40:07.366 --> 40:10.401
give you back what you've lost,
restore your nobility,

40:10.435 --> 40:13.337
let you live out your life
in some kind of comfort?

40:13.372 --> 40:16.640
You think that's what I want?

40:16.675 --> 40:18.691
What I lost

40:19.277 --> 40:23.247
when I was just a girl
too young and stupid

40:23.281 --> 40:26.317
to see the bars of the cage
she'd been raised in?

40:26.351 --> 40:28.986
I don't want what I lost.

40:29.020 --> 40:31.621
I don't want comfort.

40:33.258 --> 40:36.394
I don't even know
what comfort is anymore.

40:38.586 --> 40:39.897
What do you want?

40:47.572 --> 40:50.541
You never even said goodbye.

40:53.445 --> 40:55.228
I begged to.

40:56.448 --> 40:59.148
My father didn't give me a chance.

41:01.052 --> 41:03.587
I would give you anything...

41:03.622 --> 41:06.557
anything in this world
to make you happy.

41:08.560 --> 41:10.243
Just tell me.

41:11.229 --> 41:13.063
What do you want?
