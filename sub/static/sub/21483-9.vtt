WEBVTT

00:02.368 --> 00:03.367
PETE: I'm not the problem.

00:03.369 --> 00:05.012
You guys are the problem.

00:05.132 --> 00:07.391
This one-- worst wingman ever.

00:07.511 --> 00:08.632
ANDRE: What are you
talking about?

00:08.634 --> 00:11.291
Whatever. You guys, married--
you're, like, dead to me.

00:11.293 --> 00:13.931
This guy is like a street
sweeper-- he just cleans up any

00:13.933 --> 00:16.581
prospects I had and takes them
in the bathroom and stuffs them.

00:16.583 --> 00:18.715
TACO: Hey, I can lead a horse
to the water, but I can't make

00:18.717 --> 00:20.849
the water not want to
have sex with me, okay?

00:20.851 --> 00:21.655
I-I need Chuck.

00:21.657 --> 00:22.660
Is he coming? What's the plan?

00:22.662 --> 00:24.661
No, oh, he is definitely
coming this weekend.

00:24.663 --> 00:25.632
He bought his tickets.

00:25.634 --> 00:27.303
He posted it on the
message board today.

00:27.305 --> 00:28.303
So he's in.

00:28.305 --> 00:29.437
Okay, this... this is it.

00:29.439 --> 00:31.442
Chuck is going to
break my dry spell.

00:31.444 --> 00:35.545
You know, he can talk to any
girl, any place, any time.

00:35.547 --> 00:37.946
Guy was fearless.

00:37.948 --> 00:39.615
What's up, ladies?

00:39.735 --> 00:41.009
You want to buy me a drink?

00:41.655 --> 00:42.594
Do we want to buy <i>you</i> <i>a drink?</i>

00:42.714 --> 00:43.386
<i>Yeah.</i>

00:43.506 --> 00:45.440
<i>Do you want to buy</i> <i>us a drink?</i>

00:45.560 --> 00:46.012
<i>(chuckles): No.</i>

00:46.132 --> 00:46.643
<i>I don't have any money.</i>

00:46.763 --> 00:48.183
<i>Anyway... Oh, God.</i>

00:49.268 --> 00:50.349
<i>Oh, I just thought
of the worst thing.</i>

00:50.469 --> 00:51.434
<i>What?</i>

00:51.436 --> 00:52.234
<i>Oh, n-nothing.</i>

00:52.236 --> 00:54.234
<i>I don't want you guys...
It's embarrassing.</i>

00:54.236 --> 00:55.235
<i>No, come on, tell us.</i>

00:55.237 --> 00:57.236
<i>Are you sure you're gonna
be cool with this?</i>

00:57.238 --> 00:58.168
<i>Yeah, tell us.</i>

00:58.169 --> 00:58.946
<i>Okay, you'll never
guess what happened.</i>

00:59.066 --> 00:59.563
<i>What?</i>

00:59.683 --> 01:03.480
<i>I sat... in... gum!</i>

01:04.681 --> 01:05.613
<i>(woman gasps)</i>

01:05.615 --> 01:06.614
<i>(Chuck laughing)</i>

01:06.616 --> 01:07.615
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

01:07.617 --> 01:09.117
<i>I sat in gum!</i>

01:09.119 --> 01:10.119
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

01:10.121 --> 01:11.187
<i>I sat in gum!</i>

01:11.189 --> 01:15.002
<i>Okay, okay, guys, look...
I'm a doctor. It's okay.</i>

01:15.122 --> 01:17.594
<i>I can assure you</i>
<i>that</i> is not gum.

01:17.596 --> 01:18.429
No.

01:18.431 --> 01:19.431
It is not gum.

01:19.433 --> 01:21.034
What-what was that?

01:21.036 --> 01:24.637
That was a scrotum. Now, would you
buy me a drink for my medical advice?

01:24.639 --> 01:25.639
I guess so, yeah.

01:25.641 --> 01:26.640
Sure.

01:26.642 --> 01:28.642
Yeah.
What are you guys having there?

01:28.644 --> 01:29.643
Let's see, what do you got?

01:29.645 --> 01:31.647
He just made it so
easy, you know?

01:31.649 --> 01:34.050
He would come in like a hurricane,
and I would just come

01:34.052 --> 01:35.217
and clean 'em up, like FEMA.

01:35.219 --> 01:37.720
Chuck needs to come here, and
we need to have a full-on

01:37.722 --> 01:39.223
debaucherous, nasty
Chuck experience.

01:39.225 --> 01:40.224
Let's do it.

01:40.226 --> 01:43.227
Why don't we do a proper cocktail party
and a little Monday Night Football?

01:43.229 --> 01:46.931
As you know, I'm studying mixology...
Enough with the mixology stuff, Andre.

01:46.933 --> 01:47.956
Yeah, what is with this outfit?

01:48.076 --> 01:49.379
You look like a <i>Deadwood</i>
<i>character at a Justin</i>

01:49.499 --> 01:50.494
<i>Bieber concert.</i>

01:50.614 --> 01:52.489
<i>You know what, I'm really
looking forward to your party.</i>

01:52.609 --> 01:53.355
<i>That's on Monday night?</i>

01:53.475 --> 01:55.116
<i>Oh, that's great timing.</i>

01:55.236 --> 01:56.607
<i>That's the end of T-Lent.</i>

01:56.609 --> 01:57.900
<i>Wait, Taco, what did
you do to Lent?</i>

01:58.111 --> 01:59.577
<i>Turned it into Taco-Lent.</i>

01:59.579 --> 02:02.480
<i>T-Lent is a seven-day stretch
where we give Mother Nature a</i>

02:02.482 --> 02:03.680
<i>break from serving</i> <i>us.</i>

02:03.682 --> 02:07.084
<i>I consume nothing natural-- no
fruit, no vegetables, no water,</i>

02:07.086 --> 02:08.418
<i>not even any booze.</i>

02:08.419 --> 02:09.520
<i>What</i> <i>do</i> you consume?

02:09.521 --> 02:12.389
Nothing but Slim Jims, Gummy
Worms, artificial sweetener

02:12.391 --> 02:15.192
packets, expired candy
canes and Mexican soda.

02:15.194 --> 02:16.492
(whispers): Hey, Taco.

02:16.494 --> 02:17.694
She's checking you out.

02:17.696 --> 02:18.694
Mm, no can do.

02:18.696 --> 02:19.696
Women are from nature.

02:19.698 --> 02:23.700
Until next week, it's nothing but
blow-up dolls and tube socks.

02:27.205 --> 02:29.140
You can your own fruit taco?

02:29.142 --> 02:30.975
I've been canning fruit
for quite some time.

02:30.977 --> 02:32.711
Technically, it's the
oldest profession.

02:32.713 --> 02:35.714
Ugh, Jesus, it stinks in here.
Yeah, yeah, that's fermented

02:35.716 --> 02:37.315
pectin from the whole
canning process.

02:37.317 --> 02:39.218
Taco, why can't I
open these windows?

02:39.220 --> 02:40.952
No, no, no, all the
windows are painted shut.

02:40.954 --> 02:42.721
They haven't opened since
I've moved in here.

02:42.723 --> 02:44.789
Okay. Well, I don't want to spend
any more time than I have

02:44.791 --> 02:45.723
to, so let's get out of here.

02:45.725 --> 02:46.624
Hello?

02:46.626 --> 02:47.625
Oh, come in.

02:47.627 --> 02:48.626
That's Nadia, my landlord.

02:48.628 --> 02:49.527
Who is dead in here?

02:49.529 --> 02:50.561
Ah, that's Andre's cologne.

02:50.563 --> 02:52.296
Look at that-- what are
you doing over there?

02:52.298 --> 02:54.298
You're making drugs
over there, eh?

02:54.300 --> 02:55.165
No, no, that's fruit.

02:55.167 --> 02:55.999
I'm canning fruit.

02:56.001 --> 02:58.568
I never understand anything that you
say because you are always high.

02:58.570 --> 02:59.569
Look at you right now.

02:59.571 --> 03:00.570
You're so high.

03:00.572 --> 03:01.571
Look at-- all of you are high!

03:01.573 --> 03:02.572
Look at me. Look in my eyes.

03:02.574 --> 03:03.573
Look in my eyes.

03:03.575 --> 03:04.575
There's nothing there.

03:04.577 --> 03:05.575
No, it's, like, dead.

03:05.577 --> 03:08.412
It's like the sky but no clouds,
that's what you are like.

03:08.414 --> 03:10.414
This is it, I've
had it with you.

03:10.416 --> 03:13.184
You don't pay on time, you
bring in all your gay friends.

03:13.186 --> 03:14.185
I want you out;
you have a week!

03:14.187 --> 03:16.253
You know, and don't think that you
could climb into bed with me

03:16.255 --> 03:18.188
and think that that will
solve the problem. No more!

03:18.190 --> 03:20.190
I wasn't doing that
to solve problems.

03:20.192 --> 03:21.192
Get out!

03:21.194 --> 03:22.059
Oh, well.

03:22.061 --> 03:23.694
Uh, so where were we?
So cans... Wait, wait.

03:23.696 --> 03:24.695
You just got evicted.

03:24.697 --> 03:25.696
Yeah, it's okay.

03:25.698 --> 03:28.432
Sofia told me, if ever I didn't have a
place to stay I could go stay with her.

03:28.434 --> 03:29.700
You know Sofia lives with me.

03:29.702 --> 03:31.035
Yeah, sort of.

03:31.037 --> 03:33.270
Okay, let's just get this...
No, hold on, hold on.

03:33.272 --> 03:35.572
You know what, there's got to be
a loophole-- just got to do a

03:35.574 --> 03:37.040
little shark Ruxin in here.

03:37.042 --> 03:39.176
(humming theme to <i>Jaws)</i>

03:39.178 --> 03:40.510
<i>You do that in the courtroom?</i>

03:40.512 --> 03:41.511
<i>In my head.</i>

03:41.513 --> 03:42.713
<i>(continues humming)</i>

03:42.715 --> 03:44.715
<i>Aha!
Painted windows shut, okay?</i>

03:44.717 --> 03:48.185
<i>According to Cook County Civil
Code Section 8, it is illegal to</i>

03:48.187 --> 03:50.288
<i>restrict ventilation in a
residential property.</i>

03:50.290 --> 03:52.356
<i>I throw that shit at her, you're
gonna stay in this apartment as</i>

03:52.358 --> 03:53.290
<i>long as you want.</i>

03:53.292 --> 03:55.292
<i>Okay, well, let's get
out of this cesspool.</i>

03:55.294 --> 03:56.293
<i>All right. Okay.</i>

03:56.295 --> 03:57.294
<i>Can I take all these?</i>

03:57.296 --> 03:59.296
<i>I can't wait to use this
stuff at my cocktail party.</i>

03:59.298 --> 04:02.066
<i>Well, I guess I got to pick up
one of these cases for Sofia.</i>

04:02.068 --> 04:03.401
<i>(loud, strained grunt)</i>

04:03.403 --> 04:04.757
<i>God, my hammy!</i>

04:04.950 --> 04:06.517
<i>Pick up with your legs.</i>

04:06.519 --> 04:09.220
<i>Oh, my hamstring.</i>

04:09.222 --> 04:11.389
<i>Whoa, break time.</i>

04:11.391 --> 04:12.524
<i>A little help, Taco.</i>

04:12.526 --> 04:13.525
<i>Here you go. This'll help.</i>

04:13.527 --> 04:16.529
<i>Uh... uh... Yeah, chew.</i>

04:17.682 --> 04:19.724
This is living right here.

04:20.195 --> 04:22.195
This is nice.

04:24.566 --> 04:27.968
Yeah... let's just put
that back over there.

04:27.970 --> 04:29.169
It's your sweat pants.

04:29.171 --> 04:30.838
Yeah. It is my sweat pants.

04:30.840 --> 04:32.506
You love them so much.

04:32.508 --> 04:35.343
These sweat pants make my junk
feel so good, it feels like

04:35.345 --> 04:38.980
two angels are just holding my
balls ever so gently while my

04:38.982 --> 04:42.283
trunk is just being refreshed
by a river of feathers.

04:42.285 --> 04:43.285
It's so nice.

04:43.287 --> 04:45.788
So you're telling me you would
rather get a fleece jibber

04:45.790 --> 04:47.089
than get it on with your wife?

04:47.091 --> 04:49.559
To be honest with you, babe,
right now I feel great.

04:49.561 --> 04:51.561
Oh, God, we're so boring.

04:51.563 --> 04:52.562
No, we're not.

04:52.564 --> 04:53.563
We have to shake it up.

04:53.565 --> 04:55.565
Shake it up, shake
it up, shake it up.

04:55.567 --> 04:56.733
Do you want to get high?

04:56.735 --> 04:57.734
Huh?

04:57.736 --> 04:59.769
I don't know, it might
be fun to get some weed.

04:59.771 --> 05:00.770
Weed?

05:00.772 --> 05:02.739
Yes, let's smoke some
pot and get high.

05:02.741 --> 05:03.574
Okay.

05:03.576 --> 05:04.241
Yeah?

05:04.243 --> 05:06.243
I'm in.
I'd like to get high with you.

05:06.245 --> 05:07.245
Let's be that couple.

05:07.247 --> 05:09.247
Yes. I don't know where
to get the weed, though.

05:09.249 --> 05:10.248
Where do we get it?

05:10.250 --> 05:11.583
(crickets chirping)

05:11.585 --> 05:12.250
Taco.

05:12.252 --> 05:13.251
Taco.

05:13.253 --> 05:15.253
So, you came to
visit the doctor.

05:15.255 --> 05:16.254
I did, indeed.

05:16.256 --> 05:19.323
I popped my hamstring when I was
picking up that crate at Taco's

05:19.325 --> 05:21.725
place, and I've been in
serious agony ever since.

05:21.727 --> 05:23.794
So if we could just get a little
prescription for a couple of

05:23.796 --> 05:26.796
painkillers to get me through the week, I'd be...
You just want a prescription

05:26.798 --> 05:27.730
for painkillers, right?

05:27.732 --> 05:29.132
That's it, that's it.

05:29.134 --> 05:30.132
Okay. Let's do that.

05:30.134 --> 05:31.133
Awesome.

05:31.135 --> 05:33.135
Ask you a couple
questions first.

05:33.137 --> 05:34.469
What? Why?

05:34.471 --> 05:36.472
You came to the
doctor's office, right?

05:36.474 --> 05:37.806
Got to get your
medical history.

05:37.808 --> 05:40.109
Can't just prescribe
drugs willy-nilly.

05:40.111 --> 05:41.110
So, date of birth?

05:41.112 --> 05:44.112
You've been at my birthday every
year for the last 20 years.

05:44.114 --> 05:46.982
Okay. Patient is being hostile.

05:46.984 --> 05:47.817
Are you a smoker?

05:47.819 --> 05:48.651
No.

05:48.653 --> 05:50.619
How many drinks would you
say you have in a week?

05:50.621 --> 05:52.288
I have, like, one drink a week.

05:52.290 --> 05:53.289
Really? One drink a week?

05:53.291 --> 05:54.290
One drink a week.

05:54.292 --> 05:55.959
All right, do you engage
in sexual activity?

05:55.961 --> 05:56.994
Yep.

05:56.996 --> 05:57.995
With multiple partners?

05:57.997 --> 05:59.997
Only when your mom and
sister are in town.

05:59.999 --> 06:02.000
I'm not gonna write that down.

06:02.002 --> 06:05.003
Have you ever engaged
in anal intercourse?

06:05.005 --> 06:07.005
I refer you to my last answer.

06:07.007 --> 06:09.741
Let me just give you a
little brief recap here.

06:09.743 --> 06:14.313
You are a nonsmoker, light
drinker who engages in anal

06:14.315 --> 06:16.248
intercourse with my
mother and sister.

06:16.250 --> 06:18.317
Look, Andre, just, please,
I just need a couple of

06:18.319 --> 06:20.252
painkillers to get
me through the week.

06:20.254 --> 06:22.320
What do you think we're in,
Tijuana here, you can just come

06:22.322 --> 06:24.522
in, tell me what you want and
I'll write you a prescription?

06:24.524 --> 06:27.525
If we were in Tijuana, Andre,
there would be a goddamn monkey

06:27.527 --> 06:29.460
in a sombrero blowing a donkey.

06:29.462 --> 06:31.461
(whispers): Not in
a doctor's office.

06:31.463 --> 06:32.462
WOMAN (over intercom):

06:32.464 --> 06:33.463
Dr. Nozick, line one.

06:33.465 --> 06:36.266
Oh, give me a second.

06:36.268 --> 06:37.601
Hey, Crystal.

06:37.603 --> 06:40.804
Brought your...
Uh, yeah, I'll be right there.

06:40.806 --> 06:43.774
Okay, so if you could just
disrobe, I'll come back and

06:43.776 --> 06:46.277
continue the examination.

06:52.250 --> 06:56.453
Let's see what you're...
(groans)

06:56.455 --> 06:59.957
Oh, couple scrippies.

06:59.959 --> 07:02.793
Well, I guess this
examination is done.

07:02.795 --> 07:04.561
Ow, ow.

07:04.563 --> 07:06.864
I can't believe you stole
my prescription pad.

07:06.866 --> 07:08.866
(singsongy): Ruxin
took some scrippies.

07:08.868 --> 07:09.867
What?

07:09.869 --> 07:12.503
And then I went and bought a
bunch of painkillers with it.

07:12.505 --> 07:13.871
I love Painkiller Ruxin.

07:13.873 --> 07:15.539
He's happy, he's nice.

07:15.541 --> 07:16.807
You've committed a crime.

07:16.809 --> 07:19.877
The only crime I have is
that I love you too much.

07:19.879 --> 07:21.245
And prescription drug fraud.

07:21.247 --> 07:22.246
No.

07:22.248 --> 07:23.180
Who cares?

07:23.182 --> 07:24.248
I could lose my license.

07:24.250 --> 07:25.249
You-- I'll drive you around.

07:25.251 --> 07:26.183
This is good.

07:26.185 --> 07:27.184
Hey.

07:27.186 --> 07:28.185
Chuck!

07:28.187 --> 07:29.220
ALL: Two-Nut Chuck!

07:29.222 --> 07:30.988
Two-Nut Chuck!

07:30.990 --> 07:31.989
Two-Nut Chuck!

07:32.957 --> 07:35.224
Shot, shot, shot.

07:35.226 --> 07:36.859
Oh, n-n-no, got one of these.

07:36.861 --> 07:37.860
Quarters!

07:37.862 --> 07:38.694
Old school.

07:38.696 --> 07:39.528
That's an idea.

07:39.530 --> 07:41.463
N-N-No, it's a sobriety chip.

07:41.465 --> 07:42.464
What?

07:42.466 --> 07:43.465
Sober.

07:43.467 --> 07:44.232
I don't drink anymore.

07:44.234 --> 07:46.901
I'm, I'm completely
done with alcohol.

07:46.903 --> 07:48.869
You became an alcoholic
after you left town?

07:48.871 --> 07:52.106
No, I became an alcoholic
before I left town, and that's

07:52.108 --> 07:53.474
the whole reason I left town.

07:53.476 --> 07:55.743
I thought you left because
you got a new job.

07:55.745 --> 07:58.045
Yeah, I had to go get a new
job because I had pulled my

07:58.047 --> 08:00.848
balls out and showed my boss and...
(laughing): That's awesome.

08:00.850 --> 08:01.849
Sorry.

08:01.851 --> 08:02.984
It was not awesome to her.

08:02.986 --> 08:03.818
This is crazy.

08:03.820 --> 08:04.719
You're not an alcoholic.

08:04.721 --> 08:05.687
An alcoholic is an alcoholic.

08:05.689 --> 08:06.521
There are no levels.

08:06.523 --> 08:08.189
Oh, so you just
drink socially now?

08:08.191 --> 08:09.924
No, come on, we can
still have fun, though.

08:09.926 --> 08:10.858
We can still play beer pong.

08:10.860 --> 08:11.693
Cool, right?

08:11.695 --> 08:12.527
All right, yeah.

08:12.529 --> 08:13.528
Yeah.

08:13.530 --> 08:15.096
Just without the beer.

08:15.098 --> 08:17.197
Oh, but that's just Ping- Pong.

08:17.199 --> 08:19.700
Yeah, Ping-Pong's for fat
kids at summer camp.

08:19.702 --> 08:21.834
These shoes are
making my feet sweat.

08:21.836 --> 08:22.835
Hi-yah.

08:22.837 --> 08:24.003
Whoa, sorry.

08:24.005 --> 08:25.003
Hi-yah.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.004
Ruxin.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.206
Chuck, would you sit in
gum for me real quick?

08:28.208 --> 08:30.743
I, I can't sit in gum for you.

08:30.745 --> 08:32.510
Come on, just one more
time for old times' sake.

08:32.513 --> 08:35.547
No, I can, I can never sit in
gum for anyone anymore, okay?

08:35.549 --> 08:36.214
Why not?

08:36.216 --> 08:38.650
If there is any person on this
earth that I would sit in

08:38.652 --> 08:41.753
gum for, it would be you, but I
wouldn't be doing it with my spirit.

08:41.755 --> 08:43.688
I would just be sitting
in gum with my body.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.757
That's enough for me-- I just
need your body to sit in gum.

08:45.759 --> 08:48.526
No, it's a hollow gesture.

08:48.528 --> 08:51.261
Okay, I got blue gum just
thinking about how hard I want

08:51.263 --> 08:53.863
to sit in gum for
you, but I cannot.

08:53.865 --> 08:59.342
My gum is dead to you, and
I hope you understand.

08:59.594 --> 09:01.795
You've got to get the...
Oh, I-I get it, I got it.

09:01.797 --> 09:02.762
It's in the bathroom.

09:02.764 --> 09:03.596
Don't worry about it.

09:03.598 --> 09:05.432
(overlapping chatter)

09:05.434 --> 09:07.433
You don't have... oh.

09:07.435 --> 09:09.668
He's barefoot in the
bathroom at Señor Crab's.

09:09.670 --> 09:11.804
I know, I just peed all
over the floor in there.

09:11.806 --> 09:13.806
Why would you pee on the floor?

09:13.808 --> 09:14.707
Everybody does.

09:14.709 --> 09:16.676
Grace told me you
wouldn't understand.

09:16.678 --> 09:18.744
She didn't even want
me to come here.

09:18.746 --> 09:19.578
Who the hell is Grace?

09:19.580 --> 09:24.283
She's my fiancée, she is my
rock, and she is right there.

09:24.285 --> 09:26.752
I'll be there in a
second, I'm sorry.

09:26.754 --> 09:27.753
Hi.

09:27.755 --> 09:29.822
Um, the other one... Who is she?

09:29.824 --> 09:32.291
Yeah, that's her sister, but
don't even think about it.

09:32.293 --> 09:33.759
She would not go for your type.

09:33.761 --> 09:35.828
Come on, just do
me this one solid.

09:35.830 --> 09:36.829
15 years of friendship, okay?

09:36.831 --> 09:40.099
You're not going to sit in gum for
me, Chuck, so do this one thing.

09:40.101 --> 09:44.069
In lieu of sitting in gum, I will
see what I can do with her sister.

09:44.071 --> 09:45.203
Yeah, come on, Chuck.

09:45.205 --> 09:48.840
But you have to promise me that you're
gonna be responsible tonight, okay?

09:48.842 --> 09:51.576
Put down that beer, okay?

09:51.578 --> 09:52.844
No more, done.

09:52.846 --> 09:54.112
Winners drink water.

09:54.114 --> 09:55.447
Hey, I'm a winner.

09:55.449 --> 09:57.382
I'll see you soon.

09:57.384 --> 10:01.319
Can I, uh, get a
pitcher, please?

10:01.321 --> 10:02.319
I found it.

10:02.321 --> 10:04.121
Okay, we don't need
to use that ball.

10:04.123 --> 10:05.122
Why?

10:05.124 --> 10:07.324
Just take off the TP,
it's good as new.

10:07.326 --> 10:08.325
Boop.

10:08.327 --> 10:09.660
That ball has hair.

10:09.662 --> 10:11.161
Oh, I guess it hit puberty.

10:11.163 --> 10:12.162
(Ruxin laughs)

10:12.164 --> 10:12.862
(Andre groans)

10:12.864 --> 10:14.163
Let's do this next one.

10:14.165 --> 10:15.665
Oh, that's a point for us.

10:15.667 --> 10:19.170
Don't-- you don't
have to drink that.

10:23.142 --> 10:24.679
That's another point for us.

10:24.806 --> 10:26.640
So I called Taco's guy,
he's on his way.

10:26.642 --> 10:27.641
Yeah?

10:27.643 --> 10:28.642
Yeah.

10:28.644 --> 10:29.837
Good, I dropped Ellie off
at the slumber party.

10:29.957 --> 10:31.649
She will be there till
tomorrow morning.

10:31.769 --> 10:33.311
We're gonna get
so baked tonight.

10:33.431 --> 10:33.950
It's gonna be so fun.

10:34.070 --> 10:34.738
It's gonna be awesome.

10:34.858 --> 10:35.752
Did you make anything?

10:35.872 --> 10:37.685
Like, is there any snacks or...?

10:37.687 --> 10:39.507
Should I put some food out?

10:39.627 --> 10:41.319
Should I have made lasagna?

10:41.321 --> 10:41.901
Lasagna?

10:42.021 --> 10:43.155
What, is he Garfield?

10:43.157 --> 10:44.957
That's way too heavy of a
meal this time of night.

10:44.959 --> 10:46.925
Well, I don't know what to do.

10:46.927 --> 10:47.540
I've never hosted a
drug dealer before.

10:47.660 --> 10:48.244
Well, neither have I.

10:48.364 --> 10:48.742
(Jenny screams)

10:48.862 --> 10:49.850
Hey, man.

10:50.178 --> 10:51.249
We gonna do this or what?

10:52.432 --> 10:54.009
Whoa, what kind of weed is that?

10:54.903 --> 10:55.902
That's not weed, it's coke.

10:55.904 --> 10:57.904
I-I ordered weed.

10:57.906 --> 10:58.905
You ordered a DVD.

10:58.907 --> 10:59.839
I wanted weed.

10:59.841 --> 11:00.907
No, weed's a VHS.

11:00.909 --> 11:03.062
Well, then, I ordered a VHS.

11:03.278 --> 11:04.608
Did you read the menu?

11:04.610 --> 11:05.935
It's a little
confusing-- the menu.

11:06.055 --> 11:07.811
It's not confusing.

11:07.813 --> 11:09.194
VHS is weed, DVD is
coke, Beta is crank.

11:09.463 --> 11:14.299
I really would prefer that you just took
back the DVD and, and brought a VHS.

11:14.301 --> 11:15.300
No, I didn't bring the VHS.

11:15.302 --> 11:17.202
Well, I don't have a DVD player.

11:17.204 --> 11:18.036
It's a one-way trip.

11:18.038 --> 11:19.137
I came all the way out here.

11:19.139 --> 11:20.071
I'm not leaving without $500.

11:20.073 --> 11:21.005
So how do you want to...?

11:21.007 --> 11:22.006
$500?

11:22.008 --> 11:22.907
That's how much a DVD is.

11:22.909 --> 11:23.908
$500?

11:23.910 --> 11:24.742
VHS is a lot less.

11:24.744 --> 11:25.843
You want to spend a lot less?

11:25.845 --> 11:27.745
Well, we're not
spending anything.

11:27.747 --> 11:29.747
I'm not giving you $500.

11:29.749 --> 11:33.151
I'm leaving here with your $500, either
with the coke or without the coke.

11:33.153 --> 11:35.287
You want to keep it, fine, I
don't really care, but I'm

11:35.289 --> 11:37.156
leaving here with 500
of your dollars.

11:37.158 --> 11:38.824
You understand?

11:38.826 --> 11:41.360
Oh, fine, all right.

11:41.362 --> 11:43.262
$500.

11:43.264 --> 11:46.265
Oh, come on, don't do the...
Shh.

11:46.267 --> 11:48.000
He's doing the whole thing.

11:48.002 --> 11:51.504
Just... Just-- babe...
That's it?

11:51.506 --> 11:52.405
I just take off?

11:52.407 --> 11:54.273
No cheese plate, no
crackers, nothing?

11:54.275 --> 11:56.208
She was going to make a lasagna.

11:56.210 --> 11:58.110
I was going to make a lasagna.

11:58.112 --> 12:00.779
Oh, come on, lasagna,
this time of night.

12:00.781 --> 12:01.514
Pull it together.

12:01.516 --> 12:02.448
Come on, lady.

12:02.450 --> 12:03.282
Have a good night.

12:03.284 --> 12:04.284
Okay.

12:04.286 --> 12:05.118
Thank you so much.

12:05.120 --> 12:08.521
Thank you so much for stopping
by, and please never come back.

12:08.523 --> 12:13.260
Oh, my God, do you see how
much cocaine is there?

12:13.262 --> 12:14.528
Hey, Chuck, what's going on?

12:14.530 --> 12:16.797
I think you have a
drinking problem.

12:16.799 --> 12:17.932
I-I can't say I'm surprised.

12:17.934 --> 12:20.201
I had a feeling you might say
this, but honestly, Chuck, I

12:20.203 --> 12:22.037
think you have a
sobriety problem.

12:22.039 --> 12:22.904
What is a sobriety problem?

12:22.906 --> 12:24.540
Well, uh, we're gonna
talk about it.

12:24.542 --> 12:26.542
There are some people here who
would like to talk to you.

12:26.544 --> 12:28.545
This is all from
a place of love.

12:28.547 --> 12:29.479
Here's a beer for you.

12:29.481 --> 12:30.313
Thank you for my beer.

12:30.315 --> 12:31.148
How's your beer?

12:31.150 --> 12:32.149
Delicious.

12:32.151 --> 12:33.551
Andre, your Pinot Grigio?

12:33.553 --> 12:36.554
It's actually a Pinot Blanc, but,
you know, I'm not complaining.

12:36.556 --> 12:38.622
Anyhow, as you can see, there's
a beer, there is a beer,

12:38.624 --> 12:40.558
there is a white wine,
and there is water.

12:40.560 --> 12:41.759
What is going on here?

12:41.761 --> 12:43.560
Welcome to your reverse
intervention, Chuck.

12:43.562 --> 12:44.562
Reverse intervention?

12:44.564 --> 12:45.563
Yeah.

12:45.565 --> 12:49.232
Your sobriety is causing a
rift amongst your friends and

12:49.234 --> 12:52.502
the people who love you, and quite
frankly I need a good wingman.

12:52.504 --> 12:55.238
You're the best wingman that ever was
when you're drinking, of course.

12:55.240 --> 12:57.240
Okay, so you want me to drink
so you can pick up girls?

12:57.242 --> 12:58.240
Yes.

12:58.242 --> 12:59.241
Yeah.

12:59.243 --> 13:00.342
No, it's bigger than that.

13:00.344 --> 13:03.445
Look, as you know, I'm doing the
Monday Night Football mixology party.

13:03.447 --> 13:05.513
It's gonna be a lot of fun and
I'd love for you to come.

13:05.515 --> 13:07.582
But if you did come and you
weren't drinking, would that

13:07.584 --> 13:10.251
make everyone else feel awkward and then
would it become a reflection on me?

13:10.253 --> 13:11.085
You know what?

13:11.087 --> 13:12.987
Just drink this
because we love you.

13:12.989 --> 13:13.821
Do it.

13:13.823 --> 13:15.523
No, I'm not going to
drink any alcohol.

13:15.525 --> 13:16.457
Pound it.

13:16.459 --> 13:18.525
I think what we need to do
is show you an example.

13:18.527 --> 13:22.863
Okay, Kevin, show him how you feel
right now before this beer comes over.

13:22.865 --> 13:27.468
Okay, now go ahead
and drink this.

13:27.470 --> 13:29.536
You see what happens
there, Chuck?

13:29.538 --> 13:33.241
Do you understand that if I have
even one sip, I keep going

13:33.243 --> 13:34.542
until I do something I regret?

13:34.544 --> 13:38.979
Like sit in gum, a-and I
cannot ever sit in gum again.

13:38.981 --> 13:39.980
Don't you ever say that!

13:39.982 --> 13:40.981
Ever!

13:40.983 --> 13:44.184
Look, I think we might be having a
little breakthrough here, guys.

13:44.186 --> 13:46.185
Maybe you're just addicted
to showing your junk.

13:46.187 --> 13:47.386
Yes.

13:47.388 --> 13:49.454
Right? You don't need to go
to AA, you need to go to JA.

13:49.456 --> 13:50.455
Junk Anonymous.

13:50.457 --> 13:51.490
Yeah.

13:51.492 --> 13:52.491
You don't understand.

13:52.493 --> 13:54.860
Yeah, I go from zero
to gum in, like, that.

13:54.862 --> 13:55.861
You know what?

13:55.863 --> 13:57.929
If you come to my party, you can
take out your junk, you can not

13:57.931 --> 13:59.064
take out your junk, no joke.

13:59.066 --> 14:01.066
Andre, stop with the mixology.

14:01.068 --> 14:04.303
Come on. You... What? What?
Now you're being unreasonable.

14:04.305 --> 14:06.371
You can even text me up
until the hour before.

14:06.373 --> 14:07.721
I just need a little
bit of notice.

14:07.961 --> 14:10.348
So, where is this big-time
lawyer you talk about, huh?

14:10.468 --> 14:11.249
He's coming.

14:11.369 --> 14:11.746
Oh.

14:11.866 --> 14:12.469
He's just a little bit late.

14:12.589 --> 14:13.943
We'll see about that, won't we?

14:14.063 --> 14:15.787
Since we have a little bit
of time, you want to...?

14:15.815 --> 14:17.120
No, my legs are closed to you.

14:17.240 --> 14:19.357
Fine.

14:20.111 --> 14:22.044
You know Chinese kids will let
you play kickball with them.

14:22.046 --> 14:23.045
Hi, Ruxin.

14:23.047 --> 14:24.046
This is your lawyer?

14:24.048 --> 14:25.047
This is my lawyer. What...?

14:25.049 --> 14:26.048
What's up, Taco?!

14:26.050 --> 14:27.049
What?

14:27.051 --> 14:29.017
Hey, look, my landlord--
you remember my landlord?

14:29.019 --> 14:31.019
What is this, a joke,
him with his...?

14:31.021 --> 14:32.053
Hey!

14:32.055 --> 14:35.873
I am not joking...
about how good this corn dog is.

14:36.183 --> 14:37.280
Ruxin? (clears throat)

14:37.282 --> 14:38.448
Can I talk to you for a second?

14:38.450 --> 14:40.850
Just one...
What's wrong with you?

14:40.852 --> 14:42.531
I need you to be the lawyer
guy you were before.

14:42.651 --> 14:43.395
I am your lawyer.

14:43.515 --> 14:46.042
No. Hey, snap out...
I didn't feel that.

14:46.249 --> 14:47.404
I don't feel that.

14:47.524 --> 14:48.596
Are you on painkillers again?

14:48.716 --> 14:49.675
Uh!

14:49.795 --> 14:51.619
Oh, man, none of my
friends can handle drugs.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.403
Look, I need you to
be sharp, Ruxin.

14:53.523 --> 14:54.154
Sharp, Ruxin.

14:54.455 --> 14:55.628
The window stuff.

15:00.818 --> 15:05.442
(Ruxin hums)

15:05.444 --> 15:10.349
(humming & singing goofy tune)

15:13.520 --> 15:14.820
Back me up, Taco.

15:14.822 --> 15:18.423
Uh... (goofy humming
& singing resumes)

15:18.425 --> 15:23.195
(Taco imitates drumming)

15:26.233 --> 15:27.367
All right, all right.

15:27.369 --> 15:28.467
That-That-That's enough.

15:28.469 --> 15:29.468
All right, that's enough then.

15:29.470 --> 15:31.471
You have 24 hours to get your
stuff out of here, all right?

15:31.473 --> 15:32.738
What?

15:32.745 --> 15:33.439
You-- my apartment, number five.

15:33.559 --> 15:34.651
Let's do this!

15:34.771 --> 15:36.144
Ruxin, you got me kicked out!

15:36.264 --> 15:37.036
What's the big deal?

15:37.156 --> 15:38.256
You come live
with me and Sofia.

15:38.376 --> 15:40.480
(Ruxin resumes goofy singing)

15:40.482 --> 15:41.682
Gee.

15:41.684 --> 15:44.485
Techno beat. Techno...
(Taco hums rhythmically)

15:44.487 --> 15:48.256
Corn dog, corn dog, corn dog, corn dog,
corn dog, corn dog, corn dog...

15:48.258 --> 15:51.026
(Ruxin sings silly tune)

15:51.028 --> 15:54.430
How long we gonna do this?!

15:54.680 --> 15:56.721
Welcome to Andre Capone's.

15:56.965 --> 15:58.533
The first drink is for you.

15:58.749 --> 16:01.200
No, let's name the first
one after Andre, the host.

16:01.320 --> 16:03.069
Very well. Lay it on me.

16:03.417 --> 16:04.631
The Poser's Demise.

16:04.838 --> 16:05.833
Little bit of gin.

16:05.953 --> 16:06.988
Muddled fashion sense.

16:07.232 --> 16:09.678
Topped off with long
bouts of celibacy.

16:09.798 --> 16:11.694
All right, do you guys
want drinks or not?

16:11.814 --> 16:12.558
ALL: Yes.

16:12.678 --> 16:13.375
Yes. Sorry.

16:13.495 --> 16:14.586
Good. It's a five-stop drink.

16:14.812 --> 16:16.361
Now... Five steps?

16:16.481 --> 16:19.574
You have to wait for it, because
what happens is, we're

16:19.576 --> 16:21.510
making the drink on
every single level.

16:21.512 --> 16:24.813
The fruit, the alcohol--
it all combines... Okay.

16:24.815 --> 16:26.015
What are you doing?

16:26.017 --> 16:28.759
You can't...
You're separating the stations.

16:29.323 --> 16:30.066
Gin and tonic?

16:30.186 --> 16:30.855
Sure.

16:30.975 --> 16:31.616
Ruxin, what do you want?

16:31.736 --> 16:32.320
Yes, have some.

16:32.440 --> 16:33.954
You need to be using a jigger.

16:34.074 --> 16:37.579
Hey, I know it's the 1920s, but you
still got to whisper that word.

16:37.699 --> 16:40.349
Now, while you may be fast, my
muddling is going to be much

16:40.601 --> 16:41.466
more rewarding to your palette.

16:41.468 --> 16:42.467
Yo. Cheers, guys.

16:42.469 --> 16:43.468
Cheers, guys.

16:43.470 --> 16:44.836
Cheers.

16:44.838 --> 16:45.837
Andre, where's your drink?

16:45.839 --> 16:47.038
It's almost done.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.038
Oh.

16:48.040 --> 16:48.906
Hey, come here, come here.

16:48.908 --> 16:50.674
You can't be drinking
on painkillers.

16:50.676 --> 16:52.475
Andre, will you please
leave him alone?

16:52.477 --> 16:53.476
P.K. Ruxin is great.

16:53.478 --> 16:54.477
Are you not enjoying this?

16:54.479 --> 16:55.678
He's beautiful!

16:55.680 --> 16:56.479
Okay, you know what?

16:56.481 --> 16:59.716
Live your life...
Just put this here till Taco comes.

16:59.718 --> 17:00.484
Do whatever you want to do.

17:00.486 --> 17:02.486
Somewhere there's a riverboat
missing a casino dealer.

17:02.488 --> 17:03.487
Okay, just live your life.

17:03.489 --> 17:04.488
I don't care. Hey.

17:04.490 --> 17:05.856
Chuck.

17:05.858 --> 17:06.579
Chuck...!

17:06.699 --> 17:07.546
Hey. How you doing?

17:07.665 --> 17:11.933
Welcome to Andre Capone's, the best
speakeasy this side of Chicago.

17:12.053 --> 17:14.219
Even though we normally serve
alcohol, we got a non-alcoholic

17:14.339 --> 17:16.089
beverage right here
in the crapper.

17:16.092 --> 17:17.291
Don't you mean hopper?

17:18.228 --> 17:19.655
Hopper. I'll be right back.

17:20.078 --> 17:20.893
Thank you.

17:20.895 --> 17:23.296
So, Chuck, where are the girls?

17:23.298 --> 17:24.736
Grace and Jade are gonna come by
a little bit later, 'cause I

17:24.856 --> 17:26.097
wanted to talk to
you guys first.

17:26.217 --> 17:29.964
My strainer, and it is. Ooh.

17:30.804 --> 17:32.693
Confectionery sugar.

17:32.813 --> 17:33.980
We don't have this.

17:34.100 --> 17:36.036
I can't change you any more than

17:36.156 --> 17:37.775
you can make me sit in gum.

17:37.777 --> 17:38.776
You're gonna sit in gum?

17:38.778 --> 17:40.778
No, no, no, no, I am
not gonna sit in gum.

17:40.780 --> 17:41.979
(all talking at once)

17:41.981 --> 17:43.213
Are you nuts?

17:43.215 --> 17:44.414
It might get hot, bro.

17:44.416 --> 17:45.733
All right, fair enough,
Chuck, fair enough.

17:45.853 --> 17:46.832
It's good to see you back.

17:46.952 --> 17:47.696
It's good to be back.

17:47.816 --> 17:49.104
(all talking at once)

17:49.224 --> 17:49.902
Drinks are served.

17:50.022 --> 17:53.727
The tall glasses are for the high spirits,
the low glass is for the no spirits.

17:53.847 --> 17:55.098
And a toast.

17:55.305 --> 17:56.760
To the league.

17:56.762 --> 17:57.961
ALL: To the league.

17:57.963 --> 17:59.095
All right.

17:59.097 --> 18:00.397
Mmm.

18:00.399 --> 18:01.286
Good.

18:01.406 --> 18:02.112
Delicious.

18:02.232 --> 18:08.337
Those are actually Taco's
own marinated fruits.

18:08.572 --> 18:10.619
Staying clean never
tasted so great.

18:10.739 --> 18:12.809
Barkeep, I'll have another.

18:12.811 --> 18:14.010
Yeah!

18:14.012 --> 18:15.245
(cheering)

18:15.247 --> 18:16.446
Who wants a drink?

18:16.448 --> 18:17.514
I'll take one right here.

18:17.516 --> 18:19.516
I want a drink, I want a drink,
I want a drink, I want a drink!

18:19.518 --> 18:20.516
Let me get another drink.

18:20.518 --> 18:23.819
Oh, my God, these drinks are making
my breath taste so delicious.

18:23.821 --> 18:24.821
Did I get you? Did I get you?

18:24.823 --> 18:26.022
No, no.

18:26.024 --> 18:27.241
Oh, Jesus, Taco,
you look horrible.

18:27.361 --> 18:27.598
Hey, guys.

18:27.718 --> 18:28.462
What is wrong with you?

18:28.582 --> 18:29.232
What are you doing?

18:29.352 --> 18:30.950
Haven't had anything
natural in two weeks.

18:31.070 --> 18:32.687
Hey, I got to talk to you for a second.
Put your stuff down.

18:32.807 --> 18:33.765
Come here. Put it down.

18:33.767 --> 18:34.766
I have to get to the kitchen.

18:34.768 --> 18:36.769
When is Flannagan,
the drug dealer...?

18:36.771 --> 18:37.769
Flannagan?

18:37.771 --> 18:38.770
Who wants drinks?

18:38.772 --> 18:40.170
I don't know. Why do I need to
know when Flannagan's coming?

18:40.290 --> 18:41.503
I'll take a drink.

18:41.623 --> 18:42.555
Because I got to get
rid of this coke.

18:42.675 --> 18:45.878
I put the coke in the top drawer
over there, and now, you know, I

18:45.880 --> 18:46.712
got to get rid of it.

18:46.714 --> 18:47.680
You what?!

18:47.682 --> 18:48.481
I got to sell it back to him.

18:48.483 --> 18:49.764
If you put the coke in the top
drawer, whose cocaine is that?

18:49.884 --> 18:50.440
Huh?

18:50.560 --> 18:51.501
I'm making the drinks.

18:51.708 --> 18:53.755
I'm faster than I've
ever been before.

18:53.875 --> 18:55.436
Oh. Oh, God, that's cocaine!

18:55.556 --> 18:57.290
He's been doing cocaine.

18:57.292 --> 18:59.125
He's got to take it out of
our noses and our mouths.

18:59.127 --> 19:00.125
Guys, why is my face on fire?

19:00.127 --> 19:02.027
'Cause Andre's been giving us
co-laced drinks all night.

19:02.029 --> 19:06.050
I'm like the drummer in Def
Leppard, but I have both arms.

19:06.266 --> 19:08.202
That's why we're all jacked
up-- we're on cocaine?

19:08.322 --> 19:10.803
No, no, no, no, no, I'm on Aspartame,
sucralose and hairspray.

19:10.805 --> 19:13.805
But Chuck-- are you telling me right
now that Chuck is on cocaine?

19:13.807 --> 19:14.806
Oh, shit, yes!

19:14.808 --> 19:16.808
Oh, shit, I got to
get out of here.

19:16.810 --> 19:19.811
You look great. You look great. You look great...
I think he's gonna have a

19:19.813 --> 19:20.745
heart attack.

19:20.747 --> 19:21.746
Emergency! Coming through.

19:21.748 --> 19:22.514
Talk about freaking out.

19:22.516 --> 19:23.515
I'm freaking out.

19:23.517 --> 19:25.484
Calm down. I'm gonna talk
you through this, okay?

19:25.486 --> 19:26.518
Okay, okay.

19:26.520 --> 19:28.820
You're probably gonna
have a heart attack.

19:28.822 --> 19:29.521
No, no, no, no, no.

19:29.523 --> 19:30.522
Don't worry. Don't worry.

19:30.524 --> 19:32.824
When you die, I'm gonna take
care of everything, brother.

19:32.826 --> 19:33.524
No! Bad!

19:33.526 --> 19:35.567
I'm gonna raise Ellie for you,
I'm gonna have sex with Jenny.

19:35.687 --> 19:37.462
I promise you, I <i>promise you...
</i>

19:37.464 --> 19:38.529
<i>Don't you dare!</i>

19:38.531 --> 19:40.365
<i>...I am not gonna wear a condom.</i>

19:40.367 --> 19:41.199
<i>Oh, God, please!</i>

19:41.201 --> 19:42.200
<i>You know what you need?</i>

19:42.202 --> 19:43.201
<i>What? What? What?</i>

19:43.203 --> 19:44.068
<i>You're gonna be okay.</i>

19:44.070 --> 19:44.936
<i>Okay. Yeah, I feel better.</i>

19:44.938 --> 19:46.070
<i>Let's do push-ups, come on.</i>

19:46.072 --> 19:47.271
<i>(overlapping chatter)</i>

19:47.273 --> 19:48.506
<i>Push-ups.</i>

19:48.508 --> 19:50.667
<i>Down, down and up, down and
up, down and up...</i>

19:52.855 --> 19:54.573
What the queer is going on here?

19:54.693 --> 19:56.784
Oh look it's the drug dealer.

19:56.904 --> 19:58.475
- We exchange the coke or not?
- Yes.

19:58.595 --> 20:01.379
We're here to exchange the coke but
oh shit, we did it all.

20:01.499 --> 20:02.440
Uh that's not good.

20:02.560 --> 20:04.674
Two nut Chuck is back and he
wants some coke.

20:04.794 --> 20:05.548
YEEEEAH.

20:05.668 --> 20:07.059
Yo give us a go.
Give us a go.

20:07.179 --> 20:08.167
You want a DVD?

20:08.194 --> 20:08.961
***

20:09.081 --> 20:10.847
You want a DVR that's pharmaceutical
great stuff

20:10.967 --> 20:11.692
what do you want?

20:11.812 --> 20:14.017
- Do you have BluRays?
- I do have BluRays but that's oxycodone.

20:14.137 --> 20:16.567
It's so confusing.
I just want to get wasted.

20:16.687 --> 20:18.285
Hey, okay.
What do you want?

20:18.316 --> 20:20.059
I just want to order
some peanut butter cause

20:20.179 --> 20:22.886
Ruxin's about to get gum
in his head.

20:23.006 --> 20:25.194
- YEEEAH.
- YEEEAH.

20:28.198 --> 20:29.493
Charles?

20:30.094 --> 20:33.916
I sat in gum.
I sat in gum.

20:35.169 --> 20:37.648
Charles?
What the hell is going on?

20:37.768 --> 20:38.267
Grace.

20:39.957 --> 20:42.155
Feels like I'm wearing a tiny hat.
