Or is it you, woman I am so
happy I smashed in her 20s?

01:21.772 --> 01:24.874
I was hoping for a little
bit lower key than that.

Now, now, before you get
mad at me being me,

dying to meet you.

I just wanted to show
him where you live

you in a couple of years.

No, no, you made it very clear.

You do not want a surprise party.

02:01.479 --> 02:03.480
Besides, startling somebody your age...

02:03.481 --> 02:06.383

it's gonna be kind of hard

gave myself last year:

03:46.917 --> 03:48.918

what are you gonna get yourself?

Well, actually, it's somewhat personal.

discuss this with me?

those stretch marks?

with Zack, we used to go out

19:52.996 --> 19:54.296
you would know that I had never said

19:54.297 --> 19:56.565
I wanted some tit-tays, okay?

19:56.566 --> 19:58.333
I was only thinking about it.

19:58.334 --> 20:00.936
But then you started
actin' a fool so...

20:00.937 --> 20:02.271
I had to double down.

20:02.272 --> 20:04.673
All right, well, whatever you decide,

20:04.674 --> 20:06.842
just know that I'll be there for you.

20:06.843 --> 20:08.143
Thank you.

20:08.144 --> 20:10.012
Um...

20:10.013 --> 20:12.014
but why are you standing
in my driveway?

20:12.015 --> 20:14.149
Um, because
I just want to see your face

20:14.150 --> 20:15.617
as you walk into the kitchen.

20:15.618 --> 20:17.119
- Damn it, Marlon!
- [chuckles]

20:17.120 --> 20:19.621
Come on. Be a sport?

20:19.622 --> 20:21.790
Fine!

20:21.791 --> 20:22.691
I hate you!

20:22.692 --> 20:24.092
I hate you more.

20:24.093 --> 20:25.694
- And you know what?
- Yes?

20:25.695 --> 20:27.162
- This is the last one.
- Last one.

20:27.163 --> 20:29.198
- For real!
- For real.

20:29.199 --> 20:30.932
- Let's get this over with.
- Go on.

20:35.004 --> 20:37.338
Surprise.

20:39.876 --> 20:42.644
There is no surprise.

20:42.645 --> 20:44.712
From now on, I'm listening.

20:47.717 --> 20:50.886
Happy birthday.

20:50.887 --> 20:52.955
BFF?

20:52.956 --> 20:54.723
Best Friends Forever?

20:54.724 --> 20:57.124
Or Black, Fabulous and Forty.

20:58.962 --> 21:01.897
I will take it.

21:01.898 --> 21:03.965
Happy birthday.

21:06.069 --> 21:09.037
- Birthday sex?
- No.
