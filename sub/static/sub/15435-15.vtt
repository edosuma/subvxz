00:00.400 --> 00:01.960
Previously on "brothers & sisters"...

00:01.970 --> 00:04.170
the, uh, golden plum deal is all signed.

00:04.180 --> 00:07.260
I gave you instructions to tell
graham that the deal was off.

00:07.270 --> 00:09.310
Maybe it's time for you to
have some faith in my judgment.

00:09.350 --> 00:10.800
Did you know this whole time?

00:10.820 --> 00:11.650
Did I know what?

00:11.680 --> 00:12.760
That you're my father.

00:12.770 --> 00:14.370
Why don't we file for
domestic partnership?

00:14.390 --> 00:16.379
That entitles you to the
insurance from my firm.

00:16.400 --> 00:17.940
I said I was gonna take
care of it, and I will.

00:17.950 --> 00:19.600
David's not my father.

00:19.610 --> 00:21.050
So you're--you're
still a walker.

00:21.060 --> 00:24.360
For a second, I couldn't tell if
you were happy or--or disappointed.

00:24.370 --> 00:26.300
Why wouldn't I be happy? It's wonderful.

00:26.310 --> 00:30.630
The doctor called me to tell me that
none of our embryos are viable, not one.

00:30.640 --> 00:32.170
I'm gonna take the red-eye out tonight.

00:32.180 --> 00:33.340
You're leaving?

00:33.360 --> 00:35.200
Golden plum just filed for bankruptcy.

00:35.230 --> 00:37.030
The bank's gonna call in the loan.

00:37.050 --> 00:39.250
$20 million.

00:47.900 --> 00:49.600
Would you stop staring at me?

00:49.630 --> 00:51.650
Believe me, I wish I didn't have to.

00:51.660 --> 00:55.250
I-I would like to think that
there is still some hope left here.

00:55.550 --> 00:57.180
- Well, we could sell the building.
- Yeah

00:57.190 --> 00:58.610
Not that that would save us.

00:58.620 --> 01:00.340
Look, sarah, it's hard
enough without you--

01:00.350 --> 01:02.730
without what, saul?
Without me being realistic?

01:02.740 --> 01:06.440
We have burned through every contact we have
trying to find a replacement for golden plum.

01:06.450 --> 01:07.630
It doesn't exist.

01:07.650 --> 01:11.970
We're stuck with all these export contracts,
and our loan is about to be called in.

01:11.980 --> 01:14.760
You don't know that. He's been on the
phone for 15 minutes with the bank.

01:14.780 --> 01:16.340
They're probably negotiating right now.

01:16.360 --> 01:18.750
Or he could be on hold.

01:18.760 --> 01:20.250
Saul, how could you?

01:20.280 --> 01:25.990
How could you go behind my back and sign off
on thideal when I explicitly told you not to?

01:28.930 --> 01:31.200
they're not budging.

01:32.850 --> 01:36.160
God. I can't believe this.

01:38.210 --> 01:40.350
There's nothing they can do.

01:40.870 --> 01:42.840
They c grant an extension on the loan.

01:42.850 --> 01:45.010
Come on. No, they can't afford to.

01:45.020 --> 01:48.500
The bank is losing $10 million
in write-downs every week.

01:48.510 --> 01:50.560
They won't risk it.

01:50.570 --> 01:52.740
So what's the bottom lin

01:56.450 --> 02:00.290
uh, we cover the loan in the next
48 hours or go into receivership.

02:00.300 --> 02:02.200
Look, look, there-- there
has to be another bank.

02:02.210 --> 02:05.700
Who'll give us $20 million in a credit
crunch? It's not gonna happen, saul.

02:05.710 --> 02:08.389
all right, can I say
something? This is not the end.

02:08.400 --> 02:11.060
The bank can't take your
knowledge, your experience.

02:11.070 --> 02:12.040
Is this what you do?

02:12.050 --> 02:15.630
You-- you decimate companies and--and
then, what, give them a pep talk?

02:15.640 --> 02:17.530
Okay, sarah, I--I'm
just trying to help.

02:17.550 --> 02:21.410
Then why don't you give us back the money
we paid you to get us into this mess?

02:21.440 --> 02:23.550
Because I'm a consultant.

02:23.560 --> 02:26.770
I'm not a fortune-teller. Nobody could've
predicted the hedge fund going under.

02:26.780 --> 02:31.840
And just for the record, that money you gave
me was to generate ideas, not make decisions.

02:31.860 --> 02:33.270
That's your joB.

02:33.280 --> 02:37.940
I mean, if there's some sort of familial
dysfunction when it comes to communicating,

02:37.950 --> 02:39.680
that's not my problem.

02:39.690 --> 02:42.040
Actually, graham, none
of this is your problem.

02:42.050 --> 02:44.570
Would you please excuse me?
I'd like to talk to saul alone.

02:44.580 --> 02:47.070
Fine. Fine by me.

02:55.700 --> 02:56.920
I gotta tell mom.

02:56.930 --> 02:59.400
No. No, no. No.
I'll--I'll do that.

02:59.410 --> 03:01.540
No, I'll do it.

03:01.550 --> 03:03.650
Losing ojai will be hard enough for mom.

03:03.660 --> 03:06.690
She doesn't have to know what
you did. Nobody ever does.

03:06.700 --> 03:10.680
No, saul. No.

03:13.510 --> 03:15.140
I'm sorry. I'm still not clear.

03:15.150 --> 03:17.980
- What exactly went wrong with
her...Cycle or-- - oh, honey, honey.

03:17.990 --> 03:19.980
our--our embryos
weren't viable.

03:19.990 --> 03:23.580
Once we did the genetic testing, we
found they were chromosomally abnormal.

03:23.590 --> 03:26.240
Senator, I know this
process can be frustrating.

03:26.250 --> 03:28.660
But next time, we're gonna get
kitty to produce fewer eggs,

03:28.680 --> 03:30.980
- hopefully get a better quality.
- Okay.

03:30.990 --> 03:33.400
We just need you to take
this cycle off, kitty.

03:33.410 --> 03:35.260
Let your body recover.

03:35.270 --> 03:38.740
Oh, so we won't be trying this month?

03:39.320 --> 03:41.910
What about the old-fashioned way?

03:41.930 --> 03:44.830
Are we allowed to, or is that
still out of the question?

03:44.840 --> 03:46.760
Honey, I.V.F.Didn't even worK.

03:46.770 --> 03:47.820
But we've been pregnant before.

03:47.830 --> 03:49.690
Well, yeah, but we had a miscarriage.

03:49.700 --> 03:52.770
Uh, first of all, yes, you
are allowed to have sex.

03:52.780 --> 03:56.000
As for getting pregnant, I'll be
honest, the statistics aren't great.

03:56.010 --> 03:59.220
But as we've discussed,
you are ovulating, kitty.

03:59.240 --> 04:01.150
It is your fertile window.

04:01.180 --> 04:03.230
fertile window.

04:03.250 --> 04:05.340
48 hours.

04:11.480 --> 04:14.000
Honey, honey, what about
the-- what about the kids?

04:14.030 --> 04:16.380
- They just landed. We have plenty of time.
- Okay.

04:17.760 --> 04:20.680
Wait a minute. I need to be horizontal.

04:21.860 --> 04:24.410
- Honey, the coffee table? -
Yeah. Remember the time we--

04:24.420 --> 04:27.280
I have to lie there for 30 minutes...

04:27.290 --> 04:29.210
with my legs in the air.

04:29.230 --> 04:32.550
Okay, what if your kids walk in? Is
that the image you want them to see?

04:32.560 --> 04:34.610
Bed. Done.

04:34.620 --> 04:37.780
Oh, my god. Have I missed that.

04:37.790 --> 04:41.150
Yeah. Yeah. Me, too.

04:42.400 --> 04:44.690
oh, my god. Oh, my god. It's the kids.

04:44.700 --> 04:46.160
Robert, I thought you said we had time.

04:46.170 --> 04:49.230
We did, technically. just a minute!

04:49.240 --> 04:50.700
Well, what am i supposed to do?

04:50.720 --> 04:52.620
I'm gonna tell 'em
you're in the bathroom.

04:52.650 --> 04:54.340
For 30 minutes?

04:54.350 --> 04:55.790
You're taking a nap.

04:55.800 --> 04:57.010
- In the bathroom?
- Just...

04:57.020 --> 05:00.130
stay there and, uh, marinate.

05:04.520 --> 05:06.970
so you realize there are 7 year
olds that can do this, right?

05:06.980 --> 05:08.140
Wait, so I didn't lose my music?

05:08.160 --> 05:10.560
You know, I'm no genius bar,
but I think that you're all set.

05:10.570 --> 05:13.240
It's resyncing and... resyncing.

05:13.250 --> 05:14.720
Cool.

05:14.730 --> 05:17.050
- Hey, at least I can use my camera, though, right?
- Yeah.

05:17.060 --> 05:18.860
Actually, you should see my new shots.

05:18.870 --> 05:20.090
Yeah, that--that'd
be cool.

05:20.100 --> 05:22.270
Come on. There's some
hanging in my room.

05:22.280 --> 05:25.180
Uh, you know what? I should,
uh, I should get going.

05:25.190 --> 05:27.460
- What, you're gonna sync and run?
- yeah.

05:27.470 --> 05:28.740
I thought we'd go do something.

05:28.750 --> 05:33.010
Yeah, you know, I-I just had some
odds and ends, stuff to do. That's all.

05:34.610 --> 05:37.290
Justin, you know, we haven't really
hung out since we went surfing,

05:37.310 --> 05:40.660
and, you know, I just-- I
want things to be normal again.

05:40.670 --> 05:42.930
Y-you don't think things are
normal? Things are normal.

05:42.940 --> 05:45.740
No, j--no, just, well--
well, what about tomorrow?

05:45.750 --> 05:49.150
Do you want to maybe go grab a
double-double, see something at the vista?

05:49.160 --> 05:50.770
Dinner and a movie?

05:50.780 --> 05:53.590
Isn't that what we always do?

05:54.540 --> 05:56.240
Justin, is something wrong?

05:56.250 --> 06:00.610
No, no, no, no. Um, I have a date.

06:01.450 --> 06:02.860
Yeah. Finally.

06:02.870 --> 06:04.470
- Oh, that's awesome.Great.
- Yeah. Yeah.

06:04.480 --> 06:05.740
No, great. Who is she?

06:05.750 --> 06:08.700
It's no one. I-I mean, you
know, someone, obviously.

06:08.710 --> 06:10.740
A chick. A hot chick.

06:10.750 --> 06:13.490
- But she--she's smart, too, and
she--she's cool...And we talk a lot. - good.

06:13.500 --> 06:15.640
Like, there's a lot
of, uh, conversation.

06:15.650 --> 06:18.030
- No, great.No, no, yeah.sounds like the compte
package. - Yeah, 'cause that's, like, an important--

06:18.040 --> 06:20.290
She totally is like a complete package.

06:20.300 --> 06:22.270
when do I get to meet her?

06:22.280 --> 06:23.420
- Um, you know-
- hey, becca.

06:23.430 --> 06:25.630
- Hi, justin.
- Oh, holly, hey.

06:25.640 --> 06:28.350
I'm, uh, I'm gonna go.
Uh, uh, good to see you.

06:28.360 --> 06:30.110
bye.

06:32.550 --> 06:34.560
Have fun.

06:35.130 --> 06:37.190
he sure left in a hurry.

06:37.200 --> 06:40.190
Yeah, guys seem to do
that a lot around here.

06:40.200 --> 06:44.110
If you're talking
about david, I'm sorry.

06:44.120 --> 06:46.590
It's not exactly what I wanted either.

06:46.600 --> 06:48.490
Uh, there's-- there's
no need to explain.

06:48.500 --> 06:50.420
Well, I wish I could.

06:50.450 --> 06:55.310
I haven't spoken to him since he
left, not that I should be surprised.

06:55.320 --> 06:59.170
I don't know. I thought it was
gonna be different this time.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.750
I know you liked him.

07:01.760 --> 07:02.840
No, it's no big deal.

07:02.850 --> 07:08.490
Listen, if you-- if you want to talk, there's
no reason why we can't be open about this.

07:08.510 --> 07:11.740
No, I think I know enough already.

07:14.280 --> 07:16.170
receivership?

07:16.180 --> 07:19.070
You told me ojai was doing well.

07:19.080 --> 07:21.350
We were doing okay.

07:21.360 --> 07:24.770
We thought that if we expanded
our operations into china--

07:24.780 --> 07:27.980
china?We're not a
multinational conglomerate.

07:28.010 --> 07:30.190
We're a small,
family-run fruit business.

07:30.200 --> 07:34.530
Mom, the only people making
money right now are exporters.

07:34.540 --> 07:36.680
It's a really tough business climate.

07:36.700 --> 07:39.110
I don't live in a news
blackout, sarah. I can read.

07:39.120 --> 07:41.440
Then you should know that
doing nothing was not an option.

07:41.450 --> 07:43.700
China is the biggest
market in the world.

07:43.720 --> 07:45.940
- Unfortunately-
- unfortunately?

07:45.950 --> 07:47.640
Unfortunately? No, no.

07:47.650 --> 07:52.100
Unfortunately is, "oops, I dented the car
fender. I spilled red wine on the sofa."

07:52.110 --> 07:56.110
Unfortunately is not
"I ruined ojai," sarah.

07:56.550 --> 07:58.710
How much do we owe?

08:00.640 --> 08:02.950
$20 million.

08:03.390 --> 08:06.350
no, no, no, no. This
is not gonna happen.

08:06.360 --> 08:07.640
You're gonna get on the phone now.

08:07.650 --> 08:10.050
You're gonna call the lawyers,
call the banks, call china.

08:10.060 --> 08:12.690
I don't care what time it is. Tell 'em you
want out of the deal, you want your money back.

08:12.700 --> 08:14.000
It doesn't work like that, mother.

08:14.020 --> 08:17.620
We have gone over every possible
scenario, every solution.

08:17.630 --> 08:20.190
What does tommy say?

08:21.220 --> 08:22.850
I wanted you to be the first to know.

08:22.860 --> 08:25.440
You just said you'd exhausted
every possible option.

08:25.450 --> 08:27.060
Well, tommy can't help us.

08:27.080 --> 08:28.300
You haven't even asked.

08:28.310 --> 08:32.809
Asked him what, mother? To put up the vineyard
as collateral, to take on all of ojai's debt?

08:32.820 --> 08:34.340
Walker landing is a young company.

08:34.360 --> 08:35.730
It would be financial suicide.

08:35.750 --> 08:38.600
What, are you too proud to
ask, sarah? Are you too jealous?

08:38.610 --> 08:41.919
I'm telling you, mom, he won't
do it. He shouldn't do it.

08:41.929 --> 08:45.420
And even if he wanted to do
it, holly would never let him.

08:45.430 --> 08:50.030
Going to them would just-- it
would be an exercise in humiliation.

08:50.360 --> 08:53.010
I'm sorry, sarah. You no
longer have a say in it.

09:02.710 --> 09:05.480
mom, just send a messenger.

09:05.490 --> 09:10.090
Okay, fine. Send justin. Yep, he's
cheaper. Okay, just tell him 1:00.B--

09:10.480 --> 09:12.510
hey, I thought we were
having lunch today.

09:12.520 --> 09:16.940
Yes, we--yes, we were, ex--okay,
look, sarah's made a really bad deal.

09:16.950 --> 09:19.150
Mom is freaking out. I really
need to get into it, okay?

09:19.160 --> 09:21.000
I'm so sorry. I know we had a plan.

09:21.010 --> 09:22.840
Kevin, it's--it's lunch,
not my bar mitzvah.

09:22.860 --> 09:25.760
Yeah, no. I-I just don't want you to
think that I don't respect your time,

09:25.770 --> 09:28.870
because I do, and I-- I will--I
will totally make this up to you.

09:28.880 --> 09:29.900
Good.

09:29.910 --> 09:32.670
How about changing our lightbulbs
for those eco ones I got?

09:32.680 --> 09:35.770
As soon as I get home, I'm--I'm--I'm
on it. And you know what? Not just that.

09:35.780 --> 09:40.630
But from now on, no more plastic bottles,
no more blasting the A.C., And what else?

09:40.660 --> 09:44.040
Uh, using the canvas bags
when you go grocery shopping?

09:44.060 --> 09:45.310
The canvas bag. I love that bag.

09:45.320 --> 09:49.050
Okay, kevin, there is no way you care this
much about the carbon footprint of this loft.

09:49.060 --> 09:51.560
I wish you did, but you don'T.

09:51.570 --> 09:55.140
I know why you've been acting guilty lately,
and I've been letting you go on in this

09:55.150 --> 09:58.410
"overapologizing, please
scotty" mode, but it's too much.

09:58.420 --> 09:59.240
What do you mean?

09:59.250 --> 10:02.770
Kevin, just because I didn't like the
incredibly lame way you pseudo proposed to me

10:02.780 --> 10:07.650
over a hospital bill doesn't mean I'm not happy
with our relationship exactly as it is now.

10:07.670 --> 10:08.880
- You are?
- Of course.

10:08.890 --> 10:11.290
We don't need to rush anything.

10:11.310 --> 10:13.200
I love how things have been going.

10:13.210 --> 10:15.640
So stop acting so
guilty... and go to work.

10:15.650 --> 10:18.010
Okay, look, I'll get home early. We'll
get ougreen on. Anything you want.

10:18.020 --> 10:20.630
- You're doing it again.
- Sorry.

10:20.980 --> 10:23.430
What exactly do you want us to do?

10:23.440 --> 10:24.680
There's thing we can do.

10:24.690 --> 10:27.190
Do you realize how
reckless this was, sarah?

10:27.200 --> 10:29.690
Nobody could've predicted this hedge
fund was gonna go down.It was the top--

10:29.700 --> 10:31.240
you just didn't do your homework.

10:31.250 --> 10:32.260
Tommy, this isn't helpful.

10:32.290 --> 10:36.560
She was sleeping with graham, okay? She lost
all objectivity. Those are the facts. I'm sorry.

10:36.570 --> 10:38.160
You're not above sleeping with
an employee yourself, tommy.

10:38.170 --> 10:40.560
She was an office manager, okay?

10:40.580 --> 10:42.370
I wasn't making
multimillion-dollar deals with her.

10:42.390 --> 10:46.270
- Plse let us just stick to the point.
- All right.

10:48.140 --> 10:51.080
So what exactly did you commit to?

10:51.090 --> 10:53.170
1,800 stores.

10:53.180 --> 10:55.790
That's a big investment.

10:55.810 --> 10:59.540
So you must have taken on a lot of
contracts to meet that kind of demand.

10:59.550 --> 11:01.280
That's right.

11:01.290 --> 11:04.980
We, um, leased dock space, shipping
containers, upped our processing and packaging--

11:04.990 --> 11:07.000
just tell us how much the loan was for.

11:07.010 --> 11:09.740
$20 million.

11:13.210 --> 11:15.350
$20 million?

11:15.360 --> 11:17.990
Can I just say, I wasn't the
only one behind this deal?

11:18.000 --> 11:19.550
Yeah, but you made the call.

11:19.560 --> 11:22.500
- You're the boss, right?
- Yes, tommy.

11:22.510 --> 11:26.250
I made the call. And
I'm trying to fix it.

11:26.260 --> 11:29.610
Sorry. We don't have 20 million
bucks just laying around.

11:29.620 --> 11:32.800
- I told you this was a waste of time, mother.
- Sarah, please. Sit down.

11:32.810 --> 11:34.360
Tommy, listen to me.

11:34.370 --> 11:36.860
I know how hard you've
worked to build your business.

11:36.870 --> 11:38.960
I watched your father do the same thing.

11:38.970 --> 11:44.250
But the truth is, there would be no
walker landing without ojai foods.

11:44.260 --> 11:50.970
Nora, I empathize with your predicament
and ojai's, but this is a huge undertaking.

11:51.400 --> 11:55.460
Do you have some kind of formal
proposal that we can look at?

11:56.330 --> 11:59.130
We're working one up at the moment.

11:59.140 --> 12:02.230
Well, get it to us as soon as possible.

12:02.240 --> 12:04.230
Thank you.

12:04.240 --> 12:07.830
Anything you can do to help, please.

12:09.000 --> 12:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:16.260 --> 12:19.120
This is the proposal
sarah's asked for, okay?

12:19.140 --> 12:21.080
I've marked where she
has to sign right here.

12:21.100 --> 12:25.140
This one's for her. This one's
for m-- are you even listening?

12:25.150 --> 12:29.130
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, this one, uh, this one
goes to sarah, and this one, uh, goes to mom.

12:29.140 --> 12:31.410
No, other way.

12:31.750 --> 12:32.860
You all right?

12:32.880 --> 12:35.290
I don't know. No, I'm not.

12:35.300 --> 12:36.960
There's something wrong with me, bro.

12:36.980 --> 12:38.740
Yeah, that's obvious.

12:38.760 --> 12:40.400
Look, you remember when we
went surfing the other day,

12:40.420 --> 12:44.100
you and tommy accused me of
hiding something about rebecca?

12:44.110 --> 12:45.710
Yeah, vaguely.

12:45.720 --> 12:50.020
There was a minute there where--where
she wasn't sure if she was our sister.

12:50.040 --> 12:53.930
- She's not? - No, she is.
She--she took a test, bu.

12:54.810 --> 12:58.440
when I--when I found that
out, I-I was--I was kinda...

12:58.450 --> 13:02.640
I was kinda into that
idea that she wasn'T.

13:02.660 --> 13:04.800
Why would you not want her
to be a part of the family?

13:04.810 --> 13:08.330
No, I-I do. I just...

13:10.140 --> 13:14.860
I-I wasn't unhappy with the
fact that-- that she wasn'T.

13:14.880 --> 13:16.990
- What are you talking about?
- God, kevin. How are you not getting this?

13:17.000 --> 13:19.030
Look, I-I know you're gay,
but you have eyes, you know.

13:19.040 --> 13:23.870
She--she's not, like,
un-unattractive, you know?

13:25.060 --> 13:26.580
You're attracted to our sister?

13:26.590 --> 13:29.230
- Because I thought she wasn'T. That's what I'm saying.
- shut up.

13:29.930 --> 13:33.290
my god, you are sick. What...

13:33.590 --> 13:35.340
- have you t- -
no!No! Of course not.

13:35.350 --> 13:39.500
Look, I swear, I only thought of this when--
when this whole paternity thing came up,

13:39.530 --> 13:41.560
and it was, like,
just a-- like a moment,

13:41.570 --> 13:43.690
and--and now I'm freaked out
because what if it happens again?

13:43.710 --> 13:44.780
You have to stay away from her.

13:44.790 --> 13:48.040
I know. I'm trying to-- to avoid her,
but she keeps wanting to hang out.

13:48.050 --> 13:52.130
Like, kev, I'm making up, like, hot chicks
that I'm supposedly dating so I can avoid her.

13:52.140 --> 13:55.200
- Stop talking.
- I told you. I'm the most disgusting person in the world.

13:55.210 --> 13:58.900
Okay, okay. Let's--let's just--
let's just talk about this rationally.

13:58.910 --> 14:03.830
It's-- it's not entirely abnormal that you
could possibly have these feelings, okay?

14:03.840 --> 14:04.700
You weren't raised together.

14:04.710 --> 14:08.430
You--your--you know, you met as adults,
and you clearly have boundary issues.

14:08.460 --> 14:09.070
No, I know, I know.

14:09.090 --> 14:13.340
So you just need a lile time-out to
stop thinking about... inbreeding.

14:13.350 --> 14:14.530
- Ke-kevin!
- What?

14:14.540 --> 14:16.590
I'm trying to be sup-- why
did you even tell me this?

14:16.600 --> 14:19.760
Because you asked me, kevin! You know
what? I'm j-- I'm just gonna tell her.

14:19.770 --> 14:21.350
I mean, I'm gonna get it out there
and make sure everything's okay-

14:21.360 --> 14:23.030
- Absolutely not.
-what?

14:23.040 --> 14:27.520
Do not talk to her about--
don't talk to anyone about this.

14:27.530 --> 14:30.430
Seriously, I love you, and I get
that because she's not a sister,

14:30.460 --> 14:33.660
you might have thought things might have
worked out a-a little more complicated,

14:33.690 --> 14:35.630
but she is, okay?

14:35.640 --> 14:39.900
So you just have to put that in a box or
behind you or somewhere and forget about it,

14:39.920 --> 14:43.500
and never, ever speak of this again.

14:45.720 --> 14:47.550
Look,
kev--

14:48.590 --> 14:50.390
Kevin,
I just--

14:53.040 --> 14:56.120
- Mom and saraH.
- Yeah, mom and sarah.

15:05.160 --> 15:08.450
Can I poke my head in, or
are you gonna chop it off?

15:08.460 --> 15:11.840
No, I don't have the energy.

15:12.190 --> 15:13.940
So how'd it go at walker landing?

15:13.950 --> 15:15.830
Awful. I'm glad my father's dead.

15:15.840 --> 15:19.090
It'd kill him to see what a
mistake it wa leaving me in charge.

15:19.100 --> 15:20.340
Oh, come on.

15:20.350 --> 15:23.320
If there's someone to
blame, it's your uncle.

15:23.340 --> 15:25.900
Why are you taking the fall?

15:25.910 --> 15:28.260
It's not that simple.

15:28.270 --> 15:29.450
Well--
it's family.

15:29.480 --> 15:32.790
Yeah, ties, you know,
but blind allegiance--

15:32.800 --> 15:35.500
look, uh, graham, I don't
expect you to understand.

15:37.210 --> 15:38.900
- Now don't do that.
- What?

15:38.910 --> 15:40.740
Don't try to shut me out.

15:40.750 --> 15:42.150
Shut you out of what, graham?

15:42.160 --> 15:43.770
Look around you. There's no money left.

15:43.780 --> 15:47.130
- There's nothing left to consult on.
- Oh, come on. You know what? Just stop. Cut it out.

15:47.140 --> 15:49.920
You know I'm not talking
about my next paycheck.

15:50.650 --> 15:53.150
I care about you.

15:55.020 --> 15:59.660
Graham, I don't know what
I'm feeling right now.

16:01.720 --> 16:03.020
Don't put pressure on me.

16:03.030 --> 16:05.150
I didn't mean to.

16:05.900 --> 16:08.060
It's just, uh...

16:08.070 --> 16:11.080
you don't have to do this to yourself.

16:17.200 --> 16:19.200
Hello?

16:20.880 --> 16:23.240
Nora?

16:25.970 --> 16:27.600
Rebecca.

16:27.610 --> 16:28.770
Uh, what are you doing here?

16:28.780 --> 16:30.850
Uh, I was just returning
your mom's mini chop.

16:30.870 --> 16:33.690
I love using it, but I hate cleaning it.

16:37.680 --> 16:39.220
wait, what are you doing?

16:39.250 --> 16:41.050
Uh, just making a sandwich?

16:41.060 --> 16:43.290
Don't you have a date?

16:43.630 --> 16:46.180
Oh, yeah. Um, she, uh,
she had to cancel, so...

16:46.190 --> 16:47.460
well, why didn't you call me?

16:47.470 --> 16:49.790
Oh, I'm--I'm really
okay with it. Thanks.

16:49.800 --> 16:53.740
No, about doing something. I
mean, we talked about plans.

16:53.750 --> 16:55.720
Oh, rit.

16:56.970 --> 16:59.180
Are you sure nothing's bothering you?

16:59.200 --> 17:01.810
No, I'm good. I'm good.

17:02.880 --> 17:05.260
Let's go to the movies.

17:12.020 --> 17:14.790
So I've gone over your proposal.

17:15.500 --> 17:17.770
Come on, kevin. Just yell at me, please.

17:17.780 --> 17:20.660
Far too easy. I'd rather yell at
that idiot consultant of yours.

17:20.670 --> 17:22.810
Oh, come oN. He was just
doing what he's paid to do.

17:22.819 --> 17:25.270
Yeah, catastrophically.
Please tell me you fired him.

17:25.280 --> 17:28.030
I think he knows he's out of a job.

17:30.570 --> 17:31.530
You haven't?

17:31.540 --> 17:33.560
He still has loose ends to tie up.

17:33.580 --> 17:36.680
What, and--and if he didn't,
you'd--you'd somehow create them,

17:36.700 --> 17:40.000
because, incredibly, you still
have feelings for this guy.

17:40.020 --> 17:42.160
I didn't say that.

17:42.170 --> 17:45.170
You know what? I am gonna yell at you,
actually, because after what he did,

17:45.180 --> 17:48.640
he shouldn't be within
a mile of this place.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.430
Are you still sleeping with him?

17:51.440 --> 17:52.920
No, nothing's
happened since th--

17:52.930 --> 17:55.360
wow, how restrained of you.

17:55.370 --> 17:56.550
What's wrong with you people?

17:56.570 --> 18:00.100
Look, kevin, I had
a fling-- one fling--

18:00.110 --> 18:03.100
after my incredibly
excruciating divorce.

18:03.110 --> 18:07.630
And yes, for a minute,
I was... I was having fun.

18:07.640 --> 18:10.640
I was actually having a good time.

18:11.920 --> 18:12.940
Come on, kevin.

18:12.960 --> 18:17.280
Isn't there anything that you can do to
get us out of these contracts? Some...

18:18.410 --> 18:21.230
loophole, anything?

18:22.880 --> 18:25.650
Not that I can see.

18:25.660 --> 18:27.230
you needed me?

18:27.240 --> 18:29.590
Oh, saul. Thank god you're here.

18:29.600 --> 18:31.960
Maybe you can find
something in this mess.

18:31.980 --> 18:34.170
Look at this. These
are william's old files.

18:34.180 --> 18:35.670
Yes, I dragged them out of storage.

18:35.690 --> 18:38.680
I thought maybe there was an asset
or an account that we overlooked--

18:38.690 --> 18:42.380
anything that could help undo
this disaster that sarah's created.

18:42.390 --> 18:44.920
I never thought she was capable
of doing something like this.

18:44.930 --> 18:46.210
She didn't do it.

18:46.220 --> 18:48.930
Oh, saul... please don'T.

18:48.940 --> 18:51.940
You always stick up for her.
I appreciate it, but not now.

18:51.950 --> 18:54.810
She didn't do it. This
is my fau. I did this.

18:54.820 --> 18:56.380
What are you talking about?

18:56.390 --> 18:58.820
She didn't want to tell you.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.400
she wanted to go slower, she
wanted to be more cautious.

19:03.410 --> 19:06.620
Sarah told me to kill the deal.

19:06.630 --> 19:09.610
Instead, I signed off on it myself.

19:09.620 --> 19:12.000
You signed off on it, after she said no?

19:12.030 --> 19:17.570
I-I thought I saw an opportunity, you know, one
that was gonna benefit the company and also maybe...

19:18.190 --> 19:20.860
change my life.

19:22.860 --> 19:24.460
Where are you going?
What--what are you doing?

19:24.470 --> 19:26.770
I've gotta talk to sarah.

19:26.780 --> 19:30.080
My god, saul, what have you done?

19:36.770 --> 19:40.130
Um, so we should probably just
get the combo to share, right?

19:40.140 --> 19:42.930
Uh, actually, I like to get my own.

19:42.940 --> 19:44.870
But it's cheaper the other way.

19:44.880 --> 19:46.250
Yeah, like $1.

19:46.260 --> 19:48.340
Besides, I got, like, this--
this throat tickle thing.

19:48.350 --> 19:50.220
You know, your--your hand's
in, it's in your mouth,

19:50.230 --> 19:53.140
and it's like a bucket of
germs, you know? So let'S...

19:53.150 --> 19:55.010
okay, popcorn nazi.

19:55.020 --> 19:56.270
You two together?

19:56.300 --> 19:57.880
- Yeah.
- No.

19:57.890 --> 20:00.230
I mean, ac-actually, we're--
we're paying separately.

20:00.240 --> 20:03.070
Right, yeah, of course. Go ahead.

20:06.140 --> 20:07.680
I have to hand it to your sister.

20:07.690 --> 20:09.960
This proposal is thorough.

20:09.970 --> 20:13.230
Far-fetched, but thorough.

20:14.250 --> 20:16.710
$20 million.

20:16.720 --> 20:19.970
- It's not your mistake, tommy.
- I know.

20:22.040 --> 20:27.250
But how would my dad have felt if I
just stood by and watched ojai go under?

20:27.260 --> 20:28.820
Your family will be fine.

20:28.830 --> 20:30.580
What about the people that work there?

20:30.600 --> 20:33.570
But people depend on us here, too.

20:33.580 --> 20:37.630
If we go in and ve ojai and something
would happen to walker landing,

20:37.650 --> 20:39.900
we can't even go to a bank.

20:39.910 --> 20:42.980
We would be completely overextended.

20:46.310 --> 20:48.320
I don't know how to tell them.

20:48.330 --> 20:50.990
So put it on me.

21:01.250 --> 21:03.060
where's your popcorn?

21:03.080 --> 21:05.030
I finished it.

21:05.040 --> 21:06.600
You know what? Why don't you
just go ahead and take it?

21:06.610 --> 21:09.860
I'm done with it. It's all yours.

21:10.900 --> 21:12.990
- What, does my breath smell or something?
- What?

21:13.000 --> 21:15.730
No. I'm just-- I'm
watching the movie.

21:19.500 --> 21:20.550
Will you just not touch me?

21:20.560 --> 21:23.900
- justin- -
sorry.be quiet.

21:23.910 --> 21:26.080
- What is going on with you?
- Nothing.

21:26.430 --> 21:28.230
- Sorry.
- Will you just talk?

21:38.330 --> 21:39.510
where are you going?

21:39.520 --> 21:41.760
The bathroom. I don't
know. Stop following me.

21:41.770 --> 21:43.080
Following you? You're my ride.

21:43.090 --> 21:45.550
I need some space, okay?

21:45.560 --> 21:47.720
Justin, you've been
acting like I repulse you.

21:47.730 --> 21:50.500
- I mean, what did I do?
- Nothing. Nothing.

21:51.280 --> 21:52.920
Is it--is it that
girl? Because I get it.

21:52.930 --> 21:55.850
- If you don't have enough time for me,
I-I totally get it. - There's no girl.

21:56.660 --> 21:57.540
What about the hot chick?

21:57.550 --> 22:01.050
I made her up because I didn't
want to go to the movies with you.

22:01.060 --> 22:03.200
So what, you just decided you
didn't want to hang out with me?

22:03.230 --> 22:05.480
Like all of a sudden, I'm this
annoying, tagalong little sister?

22:05.490 --> 22:08.440
You don't feel like my sister.

22:08.450 --> 22:10.140
- Justin, I told
you- - I know.

22:10.150 --> 22:14.180
But when you were talking about
david maybe being your father,

22:14.190 --> 22:18.870
something-- I-I don't know what--happened,
where I was hoping that we weren'T...

22:20.850 --> 22:23.390
that we're not related.

22:26.170 --> 22:29.370
And I had this weird moment ere I
thought I had feelings for you, okay?

22:29.380 --> 22:33.230
And I know it's sick and it's
wrong, but it was just a moment.

22:33.240 --> 22:35.390
And I need to make sure
that doesn't happen again,

22:35.400 --> 22:39.640
but it doesn't help when you're
just-- are around me all the time.

22:42.600 --> 22:45.190
Do you-- do
you understand?

22:45.800 --> 22:46.780
- Oh, god. Look, I'm sorry.
- I gotta go.

22:46.790 --> 22:49.480
Rebecca, no-- I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. This...

23:00.090 --> 23:01.310
Mom, what are you doing here?

23:01.320 --> 23:03.300
Oh, sarah.

23:03.550 --> 23:06.150
Saul told me everything.

23:08.540 --> 23:10.480
He, uh, wasn't supposed to do that.

23:10.500 --> 23:11.770
Well, why didn't you tell me?

23:11.780 --> 23:14.400
You let me say such
horrible things to you.

23:14.410 --> 23:15.720
You didn't do anything wrong.

23:15.750 --> 23:16.860
Well, that's not true, mom.

23:16.880 --> 23:21.800
I asked saul to pass on a message,
like some 16-year-old girl with a crush.

23:21.820 --> 23:24.610
- Well, you trusted him to handle it.
- It doesn't matter.

23:25.730 --> 23:28.550
And you've got every right
to be furious with me.

23:28.560 --> 23:30.410
I'm furious with me.

23:30.420 --> 23:33.740
I wouldn't be surprised if none
of you talked to me ever again.

23:33.750 --> 23:35.590
Oh, sarah.

23:37.310 --> 23:39.940
You know what? We're all grown-ups.

23:39.950 --> 23:41.290
We can take care of ourselves.

23:41.300 --> 23:45.420
Maybe we won't be as
well-off, but we'll survive.

23:46.860 --> 23:49.530
This is dad's legacy, mom.

23:49.540 --> 23:52.340
He put me in charge.

23:52.350 --> 23:53.940
He left it up to me.

23:53.950 --> 23:55.590
Well, maybe he shouldn't have, sarah.

23:55.610 --> 23:58.360
Ojai was his company, not yours.

23:58.370 --> 24:02.070
You should never have been
pressured to walk in his footsteps.

24:02.090 --> 24:05.010
He never gave you that
choice. He picked you.

24:05.020 --> 24:08.800
From the time you were a little
girl, he saw something in you.

24:09.360 --> 24:11.830
And I...

24:12.420 --> 24:15.510
I let him have you.

24:18.870 --> 24:21.760
Sarah, listen to me.

24:21.770 --> 24:24.540
If ojai goes down...

24:26.400 --> 24:30.510
maybe it's a good thing.
Maybe it's time to let it go.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.830
And then...

24:32.840 --> 24:35.180
finally, you could be your own person.

24:35.190 --> 24:37.560
I am, mom.

24:37.570 --> 24:41.270
Dad didn't force this
on me. I wanted it.

24:43.500 --> 24:46.040
I always did.

24:50.300 --> 24:52.070
Where you been?

24:52.080 --> 24:53.440
I didn't feel like coming home.

24:53.450 --> 24:57.980
Oh, rebecca. What is going on?

24:57.990 --> 25:01.580
You keep making these digs at
me every chance you can get.

25:01.590 --> 25:03.580
What are you so angry about?

25:03.600 --> 25:05.730
- Really, you don't know?
- No.

25:05.740 --> 25:08.750
David splits for no reason, I've
been avoiding you since he left,

25:08.760 --> 25:11.580
and--and you still
can't figure it out?

25:14.160 --> 25:16.840
I took a paternity test.

25:17.650 --> 25:18.630
Yeah, that's right.

25:18.640 --> 25:23.560
I-I took some gross stubble from david's razor
and--and walked into some lab, and guess what?

25:25.620 --> 25:30.060
I never knew.I-I
thought william--

25:30.070 --> 25:33.050
yeah, but you knew there
was a possibility he wasn'T.

25:33.060 --> 25:35.170
I mean, mom, you were clearly
whoring it up with both of them.

25:35.180 --> 25:39.690
I asked you, i begged you to tell me if there
was even a chance that david was my father.

25:39.710 --> 25:43.540
- And you--and you lied to my face! - But you
already thought that william was your father.

25:43.550 --> 25:45.750
- I was trying to protect
you- - no, you weren'T.

25:45.760 --> 25:48.270
You were protecting your--
your business and your money.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.780
Our money. That's right.

25:50.790 --> 25:53.530
I didn't want that
threatened. I still don'T.

25:53.540 --> 25:56.660
I want you to have all the
things that I didn't have.

25:56.670 --> 25:59.520
Oh, that's why you let william walker
die thinking that I was his kid?

25:59.530 --> 26:03.700
How could you do that? He put us up
in this house. He put you in his will.

26:03.710 --> 26:06.550
You--you let his family
believe. You let me believe.

26:06.560 --> 26:08.800
You wanted to believe.

26:08.820 --> 26:12.010
How could you do that
to someone that you love?

26:12.020 --> 26:14.430
Then again, you know what? Maybe
you're incapable of loving anybody.

26:14.440 --> 26:18.110
I mean, look how everybody leaves you.

26:27.010 --> 26:30.510
You sent him away,
didn't you--david?

26:30.520 --> 26:33.120
That's why he left.

26:33.870 --> 26:37.070
- You know, at least he cared.
- What?

26:37.080 --> 26:38.400
He knew what that family meant to me.

26:38.410 --> 26:40.990
I walked into that house and--and
looked at those photographs--

26:41.000 --> 26:45.450
some--some lost girl looking for roots--
and--and they accepted me and they loved me.

26:45.460 --> 26:47.430
You know, you are right.

26:47.440 --> 26:50.700
I-I cannot compete with the walkers.

26:50.710 --> 26:54.380
No, you can't compete. You're
not a mother, not like nora.

26:54.390 --> 26:58.100
Nora had a husband
and a family and money.

26:58.110 --> 27:00.390
I scraped together everything for us.

27:00.410 --> 27:04.280
I took care of you every
single day of your life.

27:04.290 --> 27:08.190
Do you know I wasn't much older
than you when I got pregnant?

27:08.200 --> 27:13.030
Can you imagine that, being here by
yourself and trying to support a child?

27:13.040 --> 27:15.210
But I did it.

27:15.220 --> 27:18.800
And if I had to give up
some of my dreams, so be it,

27:18.820 --> 27:22.590
because from then on, I put you first.

27:24.400 --> 27:28.940
And now you have the
audacity to treat me

27:28.950 --> 27:32.270
like a second-class citizen?

27:32.280 --> 27:35.500
And I allowed it...

27:35.790 --> 27:40.470
because I knew that it
was not easy for you.

27:41.070 --> 27:43.290
but I am done with that.

27:43.300 --> 27:47.270
From now on, if you want to hurt
me, you hurt me from somewhere else.

27:47.280 --> 27:51.150
I want you out of this house.

27:52.020 --> 27:55.520
Fine. I'm gone.

27:59.800 --> 28:02.900
well, did you at least get
to eat something organic?

28:03.420 --> 28:05.540
No, I just had some pretzels.

28:05.550 --> 28:08.770
Yes, I know. Hey, c-can you
hang on. Hold on one second.

28:09.340 --> 28:11.080
hello?

28:11.690 --> 28:14.290
Yeah, I'll accept the charges.

28:15.230 --> 28:16.270
Hello, saul?

28:16.280 --> 28:17.500
Oh, kevin, thank god.

28:17.510 --> 28:18.990
What--what's going
on? Are you okay?

28:19.000 --> 28:20.930
I'm at the police station.

28:20.940 --> 28:23.800
I need you to come down here and get me.

28:37.290 --> 28:38.850
so what happened?

28:38.860 --> 28:41.050
I don't know. I...

28:41.450 --> 28:42.940
I was almost home, kevin.

28:42.950 --> 28:46.210
I was just, like, two
blocks from my house.

28:46.810 --> 28:49.680
I make that turn every day.

28:49.690 --> 28:52.340
I don't know how I missed it.

28:52.780 --> 28:56.080
Your blood alcohol is above
the legal limit. That's how.

28:56.550 --> 28:58.500
I'm sorry.

28:58.510 --> 29:01.020
I seem to be nothing but a
disappointment these days.

29:01.030 --> 29:03.200
Oh, stop it.

29:03.210 --> 29:05.760
At least no one got hurt.

29:05.770 --> 29:09.870
That's not the tru, kevin.
Everyone was hurt. I hurt everyone.

29:09.880 --> 29:13.500
- I hurt nora, sarah- -
everybody screws up, saul.

29:13.510 --> 29:17.240
But it's no excuse to treat
yourself with absolutely no respect.

29:19.490 --> 29:23.980
Kevin, I was fingerprinted
and locked in a drunk tank.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.720
What is there left to respect?

29:25.730 --> 29:27.930
How about me?

29:27.940 --> 29:30.360
How about the people who love you?

29:30.380 --> 29:34.990
Whatever it is you did to ojai, it's
no excuse to drive your car into a tree.

29:38.150 --> 29:41.470
I didn't risk ojai foods
to make money, kevin.

29:41.480 --> 29:44.750
I did it to try and save my life.

29:45.680 --> 29:48.190
I want out.

29:48.580 --> 29:51.350
I want to be free.

29:52.720 --> 29:55.170
Just say it.

29:56.160 --> 29:59.250
I love you, and it's okay.

30:02.970 --> 30:05.010
I'm a gay man, kevin.

30:05.020 --> 30:09.380
Tell me how I can be
a gay man at my age?

30:10.950 --> 30:14.150
I don't know how to
be a gay man at my age.

30:15.350 --> 30:18.530
But I do understand, you're afraid.

30:18.540 --> 30:21.550
I want my time back.

30:22.290 --> 30:25.990
That's the one trick
none of us can pull off.

30:26.720 --> 30:30.570
Saul, if you think this family
is gonna sit back and watch you...

30:30.960 --> 30:36.780
waste the time that you do have
punishing yourself, then you're mistaken.

30:41.760 --> 30:45.010
- Come on. Let's get you home.
- Okay.

30:51.280 --> 30:54.090
- thank you,
kevin.I, uh- - I know.

30:55.630 --> 30:57.840
I know, uncle saul.

31:03.330 --> 31:06.020
Didn't get much sleep last night, huh?

31:06.220 --> 31:09.350
No... not really.

31:09.760 --> 31:14.540
I reread the proposal last night, and maybe
we've been looking at this the wrong way.

31:14.840 --> 31:18.890
Really? What, uh,
what changed your mind?

31:18.900 --> 31:21.900
I think we need to ask ourselves...

31:21.920 --> 31:24.920
what's the right thing to do?

31:28.550 --> 31:33.000
We've, uh, given it a lot of
thought, and, um, we want to help.

31:34.730 --> 31:37.520
Thank you, tommy. I knew you
wouldn't turn your back on ojai.

31:37.530 --> 31:38.820
Well, you should thank holly as well.

31:38.830 --> 31:41.280
She found a way to make
this work for all of us.

31:41.300 --> 31:43.840
I think this is what
william would've wanted.

31:43.850 --> 31:47.690
Oh, god. I-I can't believe
it. I honestly did not think...

31:48.990 --> 31:50.270
Thank you.

31:50.280 --> 31:54.320
And I promise, we will do everything we can to get
you out from under this loan as soon as possible.

31:54.330 --> 31:57.710
Well, we were envisioning a
dierent type of relationship,

31:57.720 --> 32:00.540
- something more permanent than a loan.
- Okay.

32:00.550 --> 32:03.280
Considering all the
risk is on us, we, uh,

32:03.290 --> 32:08.000
we thought it'd be best if ojai
foods and walker landing merged.

32:08.850 --> 32:10.680
A merger was never on the table.

32:10.690 --> 32:16.030
We reviewed your proposal, and
we need more incentive to step in.

32:16.390 --> 32:18.170
Of course you do.

32:18.180 --> 32:21.390
Playing the role of good samaritan--
that's not really you, is it?

32:21.400 --> 32:24.980
I don't think now is a good
time for you to be insulting me.

32:25.010 --> 32:27.330
Of course not.

32:27.340 --> 32:30.460
How exactly would this work?
Who would run the company?

32:30.470 --> 32:33.010
Well, sarah and i would be copresidents.

32:33.020 --> 32:36.950
Well, that sounds doable, doesn't it?

32:37.420 --> 32:38.600
What about you, holly?

32:38.610 --> 32:41.550
Holly will assume the role of
chairman and C.E.O.in the event

32:41.560 --> 32:45.350
that you and i don't agree on
something, she'll have the casting vote.

32:49.770 --> 32:52.200
- You make the final decisions?
- This is an ambush.

32:52.210 --> 32:55.270
Tommy, if you want me out, just
say it. I'll do it to save ojai.

32:55.280 --> 32:57.100
- This is not an ambush.
- Then what is it?

32:57.110 --> 32:59.300
It's business.

32:59.570 --> 33:02.870
You owe a substantial amount
of money, and you need us.

33:02.880 --> 33:07.250
Now I have no intention of
micromanaging ojai foods.

33:07.270 --> 33:12.760
We see this merger as an
opportunity to grow walker landing.

33:12.770 --> 33:18.080
Now if we can do that and save
your father's company, we're in.

33:19.630 --> 33:21.820
Tommy, do you believe this
is the right thing to do?

33:21.830 --> 33:27.200
Mom... we're about to put up walker
landing as collateral to satisfy the bank.

33:28.460 --> 33:32.440
Okay, I wish I could say this was
all about family, but it's not.

33:32.460 --> 33:35.470
I mean, we have to make this
advantageous for both companies.

33:35.500 --> 33:39.170
Otherwise, we're taking on all
the risk with none of the payoff.

33:41.140 --> 33:44.540
I can understand that. Can you, sarah?

33:45.450 --> 33:47.950
Let me make this clear.

33:47.960 --> 33:50.970
This is not a negotiation.

33:50.990 --> 33:54.160
A merger is our only offer.

33:59.170 --> 34:00.900
Well, if it means keeping
ojai in the family,

34:00.910 --> 34:05.600
then I would like to see
this arrangement work.

34:10.100 --> 34:12.190
Sarah?

34:14.730 --> 34:17.210
Please.

34:21.360 --> 34:23.770
Okay.

34:24.800 --> 34:26.610
Okay.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.909
Rebecca. C-come in.

34:31.920 --> 34:34.340
Sorry. I-I should've called.

34:34.350 --> 34:37.880
no, it's okay. I was-- I was
gonna ll you to a--to apologize,

34:37.889 --> 34:42.199
but I-I didn't know if you wanted
to hear from me. Are you okay?

34:42.210 --> 34:44.250
No. No, I'm not.

34:44.260 --> 34:47.570
There's a lot that's been going on, and
I was hoping that maybe we could talk.

34:47.580 --> 34:50.530
Look, I'm so sorry that I
dumped this garbage on you, okay?

34:50.540 --> 34:52.699
I don't--I don't want
you to--to--to worry

34:52.710 --> 34:54.170
- or--or not want to
be around me... - no.

34:54.179 --> 34:56.929
Because what-whatever
I felt, it is gone.

34:56.940 --> 34:59.610
You know, it's--it's me, and--and
I feel like whenever I get myself,

34:59.620 --> 35:03.260
like, going again, I end up doing something
stupid and hurting the people I love.

35:03.270 --> 35:05.930
- Justin, please-- - okay, no,
it's not that I love you like that

35:05.940 --> 35:09.050
oh, god.You know what? Look...

35:09.460 --> 35:11.640
my point is, I-i just
want you to forget it.

35:11.650 --> 35:14.190
It was stupid, and I let
myself think that for a second,

35:14.200 --> 35:16.730
and it's like whatever sick
part of me felt that is over.

35:16.740 --> 35:17.780
I've--I've
fixed it.

35:17.790 --> 35:19.770
I mean, you know,
I--you're my sister.

35:19.790 --> 35:23.380
No, I'm not.

35:24.570 --> 35:27.140
We're not related.

35:27.150 --> 35:29.770
Your dad's not my dad.

35:30.370 --> 35:32.410
But the test-- you--you
took-- you took a test.

35:32.420 --> 35:33.650
- You said that
david was- - I know.

35:33.660 --> 35:35.680
I-I-I was-- I was
afraid to tell you.

35:35.690 --> 35:36.950
So you lied to me?

35:36.960 --> 35:39.860
No, I'm sorry. It's just, I-I--you've
all become like family to me,

35:39.870 --> 35:41.840
and--and I really
didn't want to lose that,

35:41.850 --> 35:45.270
and I know that you said that
everything would stay the same, but--

35:45.280 --> 35:48.430
- I thought you were different.
- What?

35:48.440 --> 35:52.250
Than your mom, but you're not.
You're exactly the same. You both lie.

35:52.260 --> 35:55.200
- Justin, no. - How could--how
could you do this to me, rebecca?

35:55.210 --> 35:58.420
You promised me that you were gonna tell
me the truth, and I bel--I believed you.

35:58.430 --> 36:01.320
- I'm sorry.I didn't
mean- - just go!

36:01.750 --> 36:04.500
I think you should go. Go.

36:14.000 --> 36:18.000
******* 'Cause you know we only have a
half an hour left in the fertile window.

36:18.010 --> 36:21.270
Yeah, I know, but I
think we tried enough.

36:21.280 --> 36:23.960
I think--I think
we're-- we're good.

36:25.030 --> 36:29.120
yeah, 'cause, you know, it really does
start to feel like a job, doesn't it?

36:29.140 --> 36:31.160
I'm sorry. I just--
you know what?

36:31.170 --> 36:33.810
I don't think I really
wanted to try this month.

36:33.820 --> 36:35.330
Really?

36:35.340 --> 36:37.050
Well, I mean, I...

36:37.060 --> 36:40.930
I did, but I just
really didn't, I guess.

36:40.940 --> 36:46.110
It's just that the next
part is so miserable,

36:46.390 --> 36:49.750
you know, all--all--
all the obsessing.

36:49.760 --> 36:53.690
I hope and I pray...

36:53.700 --> 36:56.670
and then I just get all
disappointed and crushed again.

36:56.690 --> 36:59.820
Well, we gave it a really
good try. We have to hope.

36:59.830 --> 37:04.500
Honey, I... I don't know
how much longer I can do it.

37:04.510 --> 37:07.360
Hey, this is gonna happen.

37:08.990 --> 37:12.710
I don't know how, I don't know when,

37:12.980 --> 37:15.220
but this is gonna happen.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.620
- did you hear the news?
- A merger. It'S...

37:22.630 --> 37:24.150
it's not a bad idea.

37:24.160 --> 37:27.030
Yeah. Well, we'll see, huh?

37:29.280 --> 37:32.940
So why do I get the feeling that's not
what you've come to talk to me about?

37:33.490 --> 37:36.240
- I can't do this, graham.
- This?

37:36.250 --> 37:38.210
Us.

37:42.210 --> 37:43.790
Yeah.

37:44.190 --> 37:46.730
Uh, I guess it was crazy to
think that after everything--

37:46.740 --> 37:49.700
- I mean, you, me, the deal-
- it's not about the deal.

37:49.710 --> 37:51.270
It's not?

37:51.290 --> 37:53.260
It was a good deal.

37:53.270 --> 37:56.930
I guess I just sense that
if things got complicated,

37:56.940 --> 37:59.760
we'd have to face up to who we are.

38:00.960 --> 38:03.330
You mean who I am.

38:07.250 --> 38:13.830
Well, uh, I am a consultant, and,
uh, you make the decisions. So...

38:14.300 --> 38:17.120
what do you advise we do?

38:18.020 --> 38:21.100
Walk away from the table.

38:24.610 --> 38:27.650
Justin? Oh, I'm so glad you're here.

38:28.520 --> 38:30.550
Ojai's gonna be okay.

38:30.560 --> 38:32.430
They're merging with walker landing.

38:32.450 --> 38:34.880
And holly made it happen.
Can you believe it?

38:34.890 --> 38:37.750
- I never thought I'd actually be grateful to her.
- She was lying, mom.

38:37.760 --> 38:39.920
No, no, no. They signed
the papers. I was there.

38:39.930 --> 38:42.280
- Sarah even-- - not
about the business.

38:42.980 --> 38:45.550
About rebecca being our sister.

38:45.970 --> 38:47.480
What?

38:47.490 --> 38:50.300
It was all a lie. She took a test.

38:51.010 --> 38:53.570
Dad wasn't her father.

38:54.110 --> 38:56.430
She's not a walker.

38:57.570 --> 38:59.710
She never was.

39:04.450 --> 39:06.620
- scotty?
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

39:06.630 --> 39:08.180
Allow me.

39:12.020 --> 39:14.000
you changed the lightbulbs.

39:14.010 --> 39:16.020
- Don't sound so disappointed.
- No, I'm not.

39:16.030 --> 39:19.120
It's just, you know, I
was supposed to do that.

39:19.590 --> 39:21.060
Well, you seemed a little stressed.

39:21.070 --> 39:23.670
- So I'm giving you a break.
- Really?

39:23.680 --> 39:26.380
- I can't think why.
- That bad?

39:26.850 --> 39:28.870
Oh, well, let me see...

39:29.550 --> 39:33.830
first I was dealing with the family business
being obliterated when justin announced he has,

39:33.840 --> 39:37.930
on occasion, been attracted
to rebecca, our sister.

39:37.950 --> 39:40.570
- What?
- Believe me, it goes on.

39:40.580 --> 39:43.540
Then sarah calls me over because
she's agonizing over dating the guy

39:43.550 --> 39:46.270
whose deal obliterated
the family business.

39:46.290 --> 39:48.570
But--thank you-- the
Pi¨¨ce de r¨¦sistance--

39:48.580 --> 39:52.970
saul, who signed off on the deal
that got the business obliterated,

39:52.990 --> 39:56.210
after being arrested for D.U.I.For
plowing his car into a tree

39:56.220 --> 40:00.910
'cause apparently he's lost the
will to live, finally came out to me.

40:00.920 --> 40:03.430
Oh, my god. Is he okay?

40:03.960 --> 40:05.830
He will be, I think.

40:05.840 --> 40:08.030
But, you know, it's like...

40:08.650 --> 40:13.240
all these crazy people in my
mily are in this insane free fall

40:13.250 --> 40:16.330
and completely incapable of being happy.

40:16.340 --> 40:18.760
And then I look at saul, who...

40:18.770 --> 40:21.680
who's missed his life entirely...

40:21.690 --> 40:25.130
and I realize how lucky I am
because I get to come home to someone

40:25.140 --> 40:30.560
who is kind and caring and
who changes the lightbulbs.

40:32.110 --> 40:34.230
And...

40:34.990 --> 40:37.330
marry me.

40:39.050 --> 40:40.660
what?

40:40.670 --> 40:42.160
I mean it. I-I don't want to wait.

40:42.170 --> 40:45.350
I don't want--I want
to make this official.

40:46.900 --> 40:49.260
- Because I changed the lightbulbs?
- No.

40:49.270 --> 40:52.170
no. Well, yeah, kinda. Because...

40:52.660 --> 40:54.760
scotty, that's who you are.

40:56.570 --> 40:59.420
I am completely,
completely in love with you.

40:59.430 --> 41:03.240
I even love the things
about you that I hate

41:03.250 --> 41:07.270
because you make me feel like I don't
have to be anyone other than who I am.

41:07.280 --> 41:11.940
And to me, that feels like family,
and that's what I want us to be.

41:12.310 --> 41:14.850
I want us to be a family
because that never ends.

41:14.860 --> 41:17.000
I'm doing this all wrong.

41:18.610 --> 41:21.810
Scotty... I am asking you...

41:22.330 --> 41:25.060
will you please marry me?

41:30.430 --> 41:31.840
yes.

41:33.920 --> 41:36.030
yes, kevin, I'll marry you.
