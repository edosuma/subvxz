00:13.747 --> 00:16.944
Who left their dirty plate
in the replicator? Tom?

00:17.017 --> 00:18.609
lt wasn't me.

00:18.685 --> 00:19.947
lt's a biohazard!

00:20.053 --> 00:20.951
Take it easy!

00:21.054 --> 00:22.749
We'll decontaminate you
when we get back home.

00:22.822 --> 00:24.221
lf l ever volunteer

00:24.290 --> 00:26.258
for a two-week
away mission again,

00:26.326 --> 00:29.124
would somebody please
confine me to Sick Bay?

00:29.195 --> 00:31.322
Too much togetherness
for you, Harry?

00:31.398 --> 00:32.831
Nothing personal, Commander.

00:32.899 --> 00:34.161
To tell you the truth,

00:34.267 --> 00:36.258
l've enjoyed
our little junket together.

00:36.369 --> 00:38.530
lt's given the four of us
a chance to bond.

00:38.638 --> 00:39.605
The bonding stopped

00:39.706 --> 00:41.196
when the sonic shower
went off-line.

00:41.307 --> 00:42.774
That's all part
of the experience,

00:42.876 --> 00:44.002
the adventure.

00:44.077 --> 00:46.272
Think of the great explorers
that came before us.

00:46.346 --> 00:48.177
They survived
without creature comforts.

00:48.248 --> 00:50.148
l wouldn't want to bunk
with them, either.

00:50.216 --> 00:52.013
Now, there's a sight
for sore eyes.

00:54.754 --> 00:56.187
Delta Flyer to Voyager.

00:56.256 --> 00:57.450
We're on our approach.

00:57.524 --> 00:58.491
We've kept a candle

00:58.558 --> 00:59.684
burning in the window for you.

00:59.759 --> 01:01.624
Forget the candles.
Break out the champagne!

01:01.694 --> 01:03.662
l take it
the mission was a success.

01:03.730 --> 01:05.857
15 planets scanned in 14 days.

01:05.932 --> 01:07.797
We've got a cargo hold

01:07.901 --> 01:10.267
overflowing
with dilithium ore.

01:10.336 --> 01:13.066
That's the kind of news
l like to hear.

01:22.515 --> 01:24.449
The explorers return.

01:24.517 --> 01:25.779
Welcome home.

01:25.852 --> 01:27.786
l should go away more often.

01:27.854 --> 01:29.185
l'm not going anywhere

01:29.255 --> 01:30.620
for a long, long time.

01:30.690 --> 01:31.679
Homesick, Harry?

01:31.758 --> 01:33.453
Well, let's just say
l'm looking forward

01:33.526 --> 01:35.187
to a hot shower and
a comfortable bed.

01:35.261 --> 01:36.193
Don't forget to stop

01:36.262 --> 01:37.627
by Sick Bay for your checkup.

01:37.697 --> 01:38.686
Checkup? For what?

01:38.765 --> 01:39.959
Away team protocol.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.694
Crew members are required
to submit to a physical

01:42.802 --> 01:44.963
if the mission lasts
more than two weeks.

01:45.071 --> 01:46.038
Now... who's first?

01:47.273 --> 01:48.205
l'll let you know

01:48.274 --> 01:49.366
in the morning, Doctor.

01:49.476 --> 01:52.536
Why put off till tomorrow
what you can do today...

01:52.612 --> 01:53.840
Commander?

01:53.913 --> 01:55.540
Mr. Paris?

01:55.615 --> 01:58.277
l've been working
on a little surprise for you.

01:58.351 --> 01:59.841
Oh! Naughty or nice?

01:59.919 --> 02:00.783
Close your eyes.

02:00.854 --> 02:02.082
l like it already.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.758
Come on.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.792
So, what do you think?

02:12.966 --> 02:14.228
A television set!

02:14.334 --> 02:15.733
Circa 1956.

02:15.835 --> 02:17.234
l replicated the components,

02:17.303 --> 02:18.736
but l assembled it myself.

02:19.939 --> 02:21.236
This... is the remote control.

02:21.307 --> 02:22.604
You select
what you want to watch

02:22.675 --> 02:23.642
by pressing this button.

02:23.743 --> 02:26.211
A slight problem.

02:26.279 --> 02:28.839
There were no remote
controls in the 1950s.

02:28.915 --> 02:30.815
l took a little
poetic license.

02:33.887 --> 02:34.945
Cartoon!

02:35.021 --> 02:36.579
l found them
in the ship's database.

02:39.792 --> 02:42.352
Vacuum action!

02:42.428 --> 02:43.452
Mop, mop

02:43.530 --> 02:44.690
Don't stop...

02:44.764 --> 02:45.696
What's that?

02:45.765 --> 02:46.959
Now, that is called a ''jingle.''

02:47.066 --> 02:49.227
According to the research
l did, they inserted them

02:49.335 --> 02:50.962
into the entertainment
programs.

02:51.137 --> 02:54.595
l know, it's confusing,
but l kept them in

02:54.707 --> 02:56.334
for authenticity.

02:56.409 --> 02:58.377
l even replicated popcorn.

02:58.478 --> 03:00.139
Aw...

03:00.213 --> 03:02.078
Mm!

03:02.148 --> 03:03.877
Everything is perfect,

03:03.983 --> 03:05.883
except for one tiny detail.

03:05.952 --> 03:07.180
What?

03:07.253 --> 03:08.811
You forgot the beer.

03:08.888 --> 03:10.480
l can fix that.

03:14.594 --> 03:17.256
You didn't miss much
while you were away.

03:17.330 --> 03:18.558
The Doctor gave a lecture

03:18.631 --> 03:20.861
on ''lnsects lndigenous
to the Delta Quadrant.''

03:20.934 --> 03:22.094
Uh-huh.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.294
lt was pretty boring...

03:23.403 --> 03:25.166
until Ensign Farley
started snoring,

03:25.271 --> 03:27.501
and then no one could
keep a straight face.

03:27.574 --> 03:29.838
Of course, the Doctor
wasn't at all amused.

03:29.909 --> 03:31.399
Oh!

03:31.511 --> 03:32.808
Hockey.

03:34.347 --> 03:35.279
lt was a shame

03:35.348 --> 03:36.872
that we had to cut
the lecture short,

03:36.950 --> 03:38.144
but the warp
core overloaded,

03:38.218 --> 03:39.276
and then the Borg invaded,

03:39.352 --> 03:40.944
and... we were all assimilated.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.248
Mm-hmm.

03:42.322 --> 03:43.949
You haven't heard a single thing
l've said, have you?

03:44.057 --> 03:46.958
Oh! Look at that!

03:47.093 --> 03:49.061
Maybe this was a bad idea.

03:50.830 --> 03:51.956
lt's Eliot Ness!

03:52.065 --> 03:54.363
Come on out!
We don't want any trouble!

03:56.002 --> 03:57.594
We're the Barkers!

03:57.704 --> 03:59.672
You're never going to get us!

04:11.184 --> 04:13.118
We're under attack.

04:13.186 --> 04:16.279
Stay down!

04:16.356 --> 04:18.153
Keep moving!

04:19.659 --> 04:20.683
Somebody cover me!

04:42.248 --> 04:44.580
Need a medic over here!

06:39.332 --> 06:40.458
Move it!

06:47.874 --> 06:48.932
Stay low!

06:55.748 --> 06:57.238
Aah!

06:57.316 --> 06:58.408
Hold your fire!

06:58.484 --> 07:02.147
l said hold your fire!

07:02.221 --> 07:03.848
l need a medic!

07:14.667 --> 07:15.656
Keep moving!

07:16.602 --> 07:17.569
Keep moving!

07:21.073 --> 07:22.131
Tom?

07:24.343 --> 07:25.310
Tom?

07:27.313 --> 07:28.940
-Tom?
-Mm.

07:30.817 --> 07:33.377
Must've been one
hell of a dream.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.051
l was...

07:37.123 --> 07:38.556
l was in the middle
of a battlefield.

07:38.624 --> 07:41.218
l was grazed right...

07:41.294 --> 07:43.854
right here.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.161
They always said television
was a bad influence.

07:48.267 --> 07:49.859
How about a nice cartoon?

07:49.969 --> 07:51.493
That should chase
away the nightmare.

07:51.604 --> 07:52.901
No!

07:53.940 --> 07:55.373
No, l think l've had enough.

08:14.994 --> 08:16.222
Stay down!

08:19.732 --> 08:20.960
Stay low!

09:06.779 --> 09:09.577
lt sounds like you had
an anxiety attack.

09:09.649 --> 09:11.947
l've never been
claustrophobic before.

09:12.018 --> 09:13.713
There's a first time
for everything.

09:15.888 --> 09:18.379
Do you know
what could've caused it?

09:18.457 --> 09:19.583
Let's see...

09:19.659 --> 09:20.921
you spend two weeks
on an away mission,

09:20.993 --> 09:22.790
working 18-hour days.

09:22.862 --> 09:24.830
Then, as soon as you
return to Voyager,

09:24.897 --> 09:26.524
you become ''Ensign Eager,''

09:26.599 --> 09:27.964
back on duty and rarin' to go.

09:28.034 --> 09:29.831
l had work to do.

09:29.936 --> 09:31.028
There was a plasma
leak on Deck 5.

09:31.137 --> 09:33.230
Plasma leak
or no plasma leak,

09:33.339 --> 09:35.273
you're suffering
from exhaustion.

09:35.341 --> 09:37.639
l'm recommending you take
the next two days off.

09:37.710 --> 09:38.699
But l...

09:38.811 --> 09:40.870
l can always make it three.

09:40.980 --> 09:43.073
You win.

09:43.149 --> 09:44.776
Guess l am pretty tired.

09:50.089 --> 09:51.317
Ah.

09:57.363 --> 09:58.387
Welcome back.

10:00.132 --> 10:02.123
Hello.

10:02.234 --> 10:03.861
Did you have a good trip?

10:03.970 --> 10:05.460
Wonderful, thank you.

10:07.206 --> 10:08.503
You look tired.

10:08.574 --> 10:11.737
Oh, no. lt's just
a little shuttle lag.

10:11.811 --> 10:13.335
Don't you have
a geometry lesson?

10:13.412 --> 10:14.845
You don't want to keep
your teacher waiting.

10:14.914 --> 10:15.846
Seven of Nine assigned me

10:15.915 --> 10:17.644
a special project.

10:17.717 --> 10:19.776
l'm supposed to build
a tetragon,

10:19.852 --> 10:20.944
but l have to use
everyday things.

10:21.020 --> 10:23.045
l'm not allowed
to use a replicator.

10:24.991 --> 10:28.119
l was thinking about using
some vegetables

10:28.194 --> 10:29.354
from the Airponics Bay.

10:29.428 --> 10:31.555
Carrots and celery?

10:33.265 --> 10:34.926
Neelix?

10:35.034 --> 10:37.696
Carrots and celery.

10:37.803 --> 10:40.363
A good idea.

10:40.473 --> 10:41.565
Will you help me?

10:41.674 --> 10:45.371
Uh... l don't think
l'll have time today.

10:45.444 --> 10:47.071
Tonight?

10:49.015 --> 10:51.279
l don't think that l'll
have time then, either.

10:51.350 --> 10:52.647
A lot of work to do!

10:52.718 --> 10:54.447
Well, then,
why don't l help you?

10:57.923 --> 10:59.220
What's cooking?

10:59.291 --> 10:59.950
Ouch!

11:00.026 --> 11:02.153
Let me see your hand!

11:02.261 --> 11:03.091
l'm okay.

11:03.129 --> 11:03.993
Your hand!

11:04.063 --> 11:05.360
We've got to get
you to Sick Bay.

11:05.431 --> 11:06.489
l'm fine.

11:06.565 --> 11:07.930
Sick Bay!

11:09.235 --> 11:10.497
That's the best joke
l've ever heard.

11:10.603 --> 11:11.797
Get down. Stay behind me.

11:11.904 --> 11:12.836
What?!

11:12.905 --> 11:14.429
l said get down!

11:17.009 --> 11:19.477
Go, go! Quickly!

11:21.447 --> 11:23.244
Come on! Help me with this!

11:29.355 --> 11:31.482
Keep moving!

11:32.725 --> 11:34.158
Try not to move.

11:34.226 --> 11:35.250
Get away from me!

11:35.327 --> 11:36.521
l can help you.

11:36.595 --> 11:39.894
l don't... want your help!

11:42.968 --> 11:45.232
We need help over here!

11:51.310 --> 11:52.242
Hold your fire.

11:52.311 --> 11:53.676
l said hold your fire!

11:53.746 --> 11:55.441
We're under attack, sir!

11:55.514 --> 11:56.446
Saavdra-- where is he?

11:56.515 --> 11:57.641
l think he's at base.

12:04.924 --> 12:06.289
We were supposed to
evacuate the colony,

12:06.358 --> 12:07.325
not destroy it!

12:07.393 --> 12:10.590
That was before the Nakan
started shooting.

12:10.663 --> 12:12.528
They're civilians!

12:12.598 --> 12:15.123
Civilians
with particle weapons.

12:15.234 --> 12:16.428
Tuvok to Commander Chakotay.

12:18.270 --> 12:19.897
Commander, please respond.

12:20.039 --> 12:21.028
Go ahead.

12:21.140 --> 12:23.199
We have a security breach
in the Mess Hall.

12:26.445 --> 12:27.776
l'm on my way.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.347
Tell them to call off
the attack!

12:30.716 --> 12:32.149
Put down your weapon, Neelix.

12:32.218 --> 12:33.207
Let us help you.

12:33.285 --> 12:34.377
Stay away!

12:34.453 --> 12:37.115
l won't let you hurt her!

12:37.189 --> 12:39.521
Get back!

12:41.894 --> 12:43.828
He appears to be hallucinating.

12:45.831 --> 12:46.855
Neelix!

12:46.932 --> 12:48.866
This is Commander Chakotay!

12:48.934 --> 12:50.162
Let Naomi go!

12:50.269 --> 12:51.668
No one's going to hurt her!

12:51.737 --> 12:53.364
That's an order!

12:53.472 --> 12:55.201
No!

12:55.274 --> 12:56.298
Not until Saavdra's called off

12:56.408 --> 12:58.774
his attack.

12:58.844 --> 13:00.334
There's a back entrance
to the galley.

13:00.412 --> 13:01.572
lf you can distract
him, perhaps...

13:01.647 --> 13:02.978
l want to try
something first.

13:06.552 --> 13:07.610
Neelix!

13:07.686 --> 13:10.780
Listen to me. lt's okay.

13:10.856 --> 13:13.518
Saavdra ordered a cease-fire.

13:13.592 --> 13:14.889
The colony's secure.

13:15.027 --> 13:16.995
The battle's over.

13:19.165 --> 13:21.065
Why do l still
hear weapons fire?

13:23.269 --> 13:24.896
lt's just a few soldiers.

13:25.070 --> 13:26.037
They're celebrating.

13:26.138 --> 13:27.435
The battle's over.

13:31.277 --> 13:33.245
Neelix, please.

13:33.312 --> 13:34.939
l'll protect Naomi.

13:37.249 --> 13:39.046
How do l know
you won't trick me?

13:41.120 --> 13:43.054
Because l'm on your side.

13:43.122 --> 13:45.090
l want to end this conflict
as much as you do.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.316
Let her go.

13:48.394 --> 13:50.453
lt's safe now.

13:50.529 --> 13:51.996
The killing's over.

14:33.038 --> 14:34.403
l gave him
a mild sedative.

14:34.473 --> 14:36.338
Any idea what caused
the delusions?

14:36.408 --> 14:39.935
His norepinephrine levels are
three times what they should be.

14:40.079 --> 14:42.673
Neurochemically speaking,
he's suffering from a form

14:42.748 --> 14:45.182
of post-traumatic
stress syndrome.

14:45.251 --> 14:48.049
l dreamed l was fighting
in an alien war.

14:48.120 --> 14:51.578
The same war Neelix
seemed to be reliving.

14:51.657 --> 14:52.749
Harry Kim was in earlier.

14:52.825 --> 14:54.622
He had an anxiety attack.

14:54.693 --> 14:56.923
l haven't spoken
with Mr. Paris yet.

14:56.996 --> 14:59.863
Three members
of the same away team.

14:59.932 --> 15:01.923
Did you run into any kind
of trouble while you were gone?

15:02.034 --> 15:02.932
None.

15:03.035 --> 15:04.229
The mission was by the book.

15:04.336 --> 15:07.828
Your engramatic activities
contradict that, Commander.

15:08.007 --> 15:09.474
These are real memories,

15:09.541 --> 15:11.634
not mere dreams
or hallucinations.

15:11.710 --> 15:13.371
Maybe you were abducted...

15:13.445 --> 15:15.413
manipulated into fighting.

15:15.481 --> 15:18.416
Our memories have been
tampered with before.

15:18.484 --> 15:21.578
We're going to retrace
your mission.

15:21.654 --> 15:22.586
Start reviewing

15:22.655 --> 15:24.646
the Delta Flyer sensor logs.

15:24.723 --> 15:26.554
See if you come up
with anything unusual.

15:26.625 --> 15:28.786
How long before Neelix
is back on his feet?

15:28.861 --> 15:30.658
l can wake him now
if you'd like.

15:30.729 --> 15:32.390
Do it.

15:34.066 --> 15:36.261
Each of you seems to hold
a piece of the puzzle.

15:36.368 --> 15:39.860
Let's see if we can start
putting them together.

15:39.972 --> 15:43.738
l don't remember much,
just bits and pieces.

15:43.809 --> 15:48.303
l dreamt l was on a planet
in the middle of a battle.

15:48.380 --> 15:50.211
l have no idea
how l got there.

15:50.282 --> 15:51.214
l can't remember.

15:51.283 --> 15:52.307
When l was in the Jefferies

15:52.384 --> 15:56.548
tube, l heard
weapons fire, screams.

15:56.622 --> 15:58.249
People were screaming.

15:58.324 --> 16:00.258
l got
so frightened.

16:00.326 --> 16:01.623
Of what?

16:01.694 --> 16:03.321
l... l don't know.

16:03.395 --> 16:04.828
l remember getting shot.

16:04.930 --> 16:07.490
There's no evidence
of a wound.

16:07.566 --> 16:09.966
lf our memories were wiped,

16:10.069 --> 16:13.368
our physical injuries
could have been masked as well.

16:13.439 --> 16:16.237
Do any of you recall
who you were fighting?

16:16.308 --> 16:18.037
lt was dark.

16:18.110 --> 16:20.078
l couldn't see them very well.

16:20.145 --> 16:21.544
They were firing at us.

16:21.613 --> 16:24.980
The Naka... Na... Nakana...

16:25.050 --> 16:27.075
Nakan.

16:27.152 --> 16:28.312
They were called the Nakan.

16:28.387 --> 16:29.319
Right.

16:29.388 --> 16:31.618
Right.

16:31.690 --> 16:34.181
They... they lived
in a remote colony.

16:34.259 --> 16:36.750
We were trying
to evacuate them.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.229
But they were fighting us.

16:39.298 --> 16:42.358
Why couldn't they just
do what they were told?

16:42.468 --> 16:43.662
We had no right to be there!

16:43.769 --> 16:45.134
lt was for
their own good.

16:45.204 --> 16:47.172
Gentlemen, stay focused.

16:47.239 --> 16:49.935
You said you were trying
to evacuate their colony.

16:50.009 --> 16:50.941
Why?

16:51.010 --> 16:53.035
Those were our orders.

16:53.112 --> 16:54.204
Who gave them?

16:55.814 --> 16:57.805
Saavdra.

16:57.883 --> 16:59.783
Commander Saavdra.

16:59.852 --> 17:00.841
He was in charge of our unit.

17:00.953 --> 17:02.181
We were part
of an attack force.

17:02.221 --> 17:03.984
You were coerced?

17:04.056 --> 17:05.182
No!

17:05.257 --> 17:06.348
No, l volunteered.

17:06.425 --> 17:07.392
We all did.

17:07.459 --> 17:09.393
l find that difficult
to believe.

17:09.461 --> 17:10.826
You were obviously
manipulated somehow.

17:10.963 --> 17:15.991
No! No, no, no, no,
l remember now.

17:16.101 --> 17:19.298
We held a, uh, a briefing
to plan the evacuation.

17:19.405 --> 17:20.702
You were there, Commander.

17:20.772 --> 17:21.740
Mr. Paris!

17:21.807 --> 17:23.637
lt was a command post.

17:23.709 --> 17:24.641
That's right.

17:24.710 --> 17:27.076
lt was night, 0200 hours.

17:27.146 --> 17:29.979
We'd been awake for days.

17:32.618 --> 17:33.710
We were exhausted.

17:33.819 --> 17:36.219
What do our spotters report?

17:36.288 --> 17:37.220
The Nakan are unarmed.

17:37.289 --> 17:38.415
They won't put up a fight.

17:38.490 --> 17:40.890
Once we've disabled
their shield generators,

17:40.959 --> 17:43.621
we'll deploy Units 5 and 6.

17:43.695 --> 17:47.529
They may be unarmed, but they
won't be happy to see us.

17:47.599 --> 17:49.123
Don't provoke them.

17:49.234 --> 17:52.670
l want to come out of this
with zero casualties

17:52.771 --> 17:54.204
on both sides.

17:54.273 --> 17:55.831
Understood.

17:55.941 --> 17:58.136
The perimeter is the weakest
in Sector 14.

17:58.210 --> 17:59.234
The terrain's very flat.

17:59.311 --> 18:01.871
lt's an ideal landing spot
for transports.

18:01.980 --> 18:03.641
Once we've secured the village,

18:03.682 --> 18:05.047
take the colonists there.

18:05.117 --> 18:06.141
Get them aboard.

18:06.218 --> 18:08.243
Do your best to reassure them.

18:08.320 --> 18:11.812
Make them understand that this
is a temporary relocation,

18:11.957 --> 18:13.822
that they're going
to be back there

18:13.959 --> 18:15.119
within a few weeks.

18:15.194 --> 18:16.422
Understood.

18:16.495 --> 18:19.487
Yes, sir! Aye, aye, sir.

18:21.700 --> 18:22.826
Problem?

18:23.001 --> 18:24.468
Just one.

18:24.570 --> 18:26.868
This unit could
use a little sleep.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.702
l suggest we wait
until daybreak.

18:28.774 --> 18:30.833
l promised Command
we'd have this colony

18:30.943 --> 18:32.137
secured today.

18:32.211 --> 18:33.439
lt can wait a few hours.

18:33.512 --> 18:36.174
l'm sorry.

18:36.248 --> 18:40.412
But when this mission's over,
how does a week

18:40.486 --> 18:42.317
on Toranius Prime sound?

18:42.387 --> 18:44.014
Never been there.

18:44.089 --> 18:47.616
Compared to this place,
it's paradise.

18:49.261 --> 18:50.193
The mission proceeded

18:50.262 --> 18:51.889
as planned.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.330
We disabled their
shield generators

18:54.399 --> 18:55.696
and entered the colony.

18:55.801 --> 18:56.893
We were rounding up the Nakan.

18:57.069 --> 18:59.970
To be honest, l expected them to
give us a little more trouble.

19:00.072 --> 19:02.097
But then we came
to the last enclosure.

19:02.207 --> 19:04.107
Do you remember
the last enclosure?

19:04.176 --> 19:05.438
lt was empty.

19:05.511 --> 19:07.138
Where were they?

19:07.212 --> 19:08.543
They were supposed
to be there.

19:08.614 --> 19:10.411
24 colonists unaccounted for.

19:10.482 --> 19:12.416
We thought the spotters
had made a mistake.

19:12.484 --> 19:14.782
We should've known
something was wrong.

19:14.853 --> 19:16.616
We should've gotten out then.

19:16.688 --> 19:17.620
This way.

19:17.689 --> 19:19.281
Stay in line.

19:19.358 --> 19:21.155
Keep moving.

19:21.226 --> 19:23.126
Evacuation detail to base.

19:23.195 --> 19:24.219
We're ready for transport.

19:24.296 --> 19:26.196
Transports on approach.

19:26.265 --> 19:27.232
Keep moving.

19:27.299 --> 19:28.664
l have to find my husband.

19:28.734 --> 19:29.666
Don't worry.

19:29.768 --> 19:31.463
He'll be on one
of the transports.

19:31.570 --> 19:33.663
Which one?

19:33.772 --> 19:35.137
l, l don't know,
but we'll find him.

19:36.308 --> 19:37.172
Everybody down!

19:42.314 --> 19:44.179
Base, we're under attack.

19:44.249 --> 19:46.114
Repeat, we're under attack.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.346
Those missing colonists,
they were armed.

19:48.420 --> 19:49.409
They fired the first shots.

19:49.488 --> 19:50.512
lt wasn't our fault.

19:50.589 --> 19:51.886
You can't be sure of that.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.355
lt could've been
one of our own people.

19:53.425 --> 19:55.325
Fatigue, a phaser
malfunction--

19:55.394 --> 19:56.361
you just don't know!

19:56.428 --> 19:59.886
Either way, it doesn't
justify what we did.

19:59.965 --> 20:01.694
What did you do?

20:01.767 --> 20:02.893
What happened down there?

20:03.068 --> 20:04.296
Keep moving.

20:04.403 --> 20:05.563
Stay together!

20:09.541 --> 20:10.508
Hold your fire!

20:13.545 --> 20:14.842
Stay down!

20:17.516 --> 20:18.483
Stay together!

20:18.550 --> 20:20.484
Stop running! Stop!

20:20.552 --> 20:21.849
Get down!

20:24.423 --> 20:26.357
Get down! Get down!
Get down!

20:27.492 --> 20:28.754
Stop running!

20:31.263 --> 20:32.787
Stop running!

20:32.864 --> 20:35.264
Stop running!
Stop running!

20:36.535 --> 20:37.695
Stop running!

20:37.803 --> 20:39.703
l said stop!

20:39.771 --> 20:41.136
We didn't have any other choice.

20:41.206 --> 20:42.673
Like hell, we didn't.

20:42.774 --> 20:44.708
They were wiping us out!

20:44.776 --> 20:46.641
That didn't give us
the right to murder civilians.

20:46.712 --> 20:48.612
l tried to protect
the children,

20:48.680 --> 20:51.148
but l couldn't stop them
from running away.

20:51.216 --> 20:52.945
l ran, too.

20:53.018 --> 20:57.387
Sounds of phaser fire,
people shouting...

20:57.456 --> 20:58.980
l had to get out of there.

21:53.712 --> 21:55.407
Please, please, don't hurt us!

21:55.480 --> 21:58.210
Move out
where l can see you!

22:01.987 --> 22:02.885
Move!

22:02.954 --> 22:05.821
Please. Please,
he's no threat to you.

22:06.892 --> 22:08.655
Tell me how l can
get out of these tunnels,

22:08.727 --> 22:10.092
and l'll leave you alone.

22:12.097 --> 22:13.257
Tell me!

22:13.332 --> 22:15.562
Oh! Go back the way you came.

22:15.634 --> 22:18.330
At the second fork,
take the tunnel to your left,

22:18.437 --> 22:20.302
follow it to the end.

22:20.372 --> 22:22.203
lt will lead you to the river.

22:30.015 --> 22:31.778
He was going to kill me.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.249
Easy, Harry.

22:33.318 --> 22:34.410
They wouldn't listen!

22:34.486 --> 22:35.475
Why?

22:35.554 --> 22:37.249
Why wouldn't they listen?

22:39.458 --> 22:42.894
We killed 82 civilians
that night.

22:42.961 --> 22:45.953
No one was left alive.

22:52.270 --> 22:54.238
Captain's Log, supplemental.

22:54.306 --> 22:55.432
We've entered the system

22:55.540 --> 22:57.872
where the away team
conducted its recent survey,

22:57.943 --> 22:59.376
hoping to find an explanation

22:59.444 --> 23:01.571
for their memories
of the Nakan massacre.

23:07.119 --> 23:08.484
Yeah.

23:09.521 --> 23:11.352
Yeah!

23:16.361 --> 23:18.158
Missed you at breakfast.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.892
l wasn't hungry.

23:20.999 --> 23:23.627
Sleep a little?

23:23.735 --> 23:27.535
Five... six minutes.

23:27.606 --> 23:31.474
l found another episode
of The Untouchables.

23:31.543 --> 23:35.809
Eliot Ness captures
someone named Al Cay-pone.

23:35.881 --> 23:37.940
''Capone.''

23:38.049 --> 23:39.448
Maybe later.

23:43.655 --> 23:44.917
Well, you've got
to eat something.

23:44.990 --> 23:46.287
Pizza?

23:46.358 --> 23:49.691
Look, l appreciate what
you're trying to do,

23:49.761 --> 23:51.285
but l'd rather just be alone.

23:53.432 --> 23:54.399
Tom...

23:54.466 --> 23:55.490
No!

23:55.567 --> 24:00.163
l don't want to be...
comforted right now.

24:03.008 --> 24:04.635
l know the last few days
have been difficult.

24:04.709 --> 24:06.506
Oh. ''Difficult.''

24:06.578 --> 24:09.206
''Difficult'' doesn't
quite cover it.

24:09.281 --> 24:12.614
l helped murder
82 innocent people.

24:12.684 --> 24:13.742
You don't know that.

24:13.819 --> 24:14.751
l know what l remember.

24:14.820 --> 24:15.752
The Doctor says your memories

24:15.821 --> 24:16.753
could have been altered.

24:16.822 --> 24:18.119
l was there!

24:18.190 --> 24:21.318
When l close my eyes,
l can see the bodies.

24:21.393 --> 24:23.657
l-l can hear
the weapons fire!

24:23.728 --> 24:25.127
l can feel
where l was shot!

24:25.197 --> 24:26.721
Then why isn't there
evidence of a war...?

24:26.798 --> 24:28.129
l don't know!

24:28.200 --> 24:31.567
All l'm asking is that you
consider the possibility

24:31.670 --> 24:34.935
that this didn't happen.

24:35.006 --> 24:36.803
We'll keep investigating.

24:36.875 --> 24:38.900
There are sensor readings
on the Delta Flyer

24:39.010 --> 24:40.272
that we haven't
even analyzed yet.

24:40.345 --> 24:43.610
l-l can't concentrate
on sensor readings right now.

24:43.682 --> 24:44.910
Try.

24:44.983 --> 24:46.848
l can't! Stop pushing me!

24:46.918 --> 24:49.887
l don't want your help!

24:53.558 --> 24:56.152
l'm sorry.

24:56.228 --> 24:59.254
You know where to find me.

25:04.769 --> 25:07.169
This was your first
stop on the away mission,

25:07.239 --> 25:08.331
a Class-M planet

25:08.440 --> 25:09.566
with one natural satellite.

25:09.674 --> 25:11.232
Did you send anyone
to the surface?

25:11.343 --> 25:13.277
No, we only scanned
for dilithium deposits.

25:13.345 --> 25:15.176
We were in orbit
for less than an hour.

25:15.247 --> 25:16.214
Next.

25:17.182 --> 25:19.412
You came into contact
with this vessel

25:19.484 --> 25:21.042
en route to your second

25:21.119 --> 25:22.416
destination.

25:22.487 --> 25:24.717
Captain Bathar of Hodos.

25:24.789 --> 25:26.051
Photogenic.

25:26.124 --> 25:27.523
He's a merchant.

25:27.592 --> 25:30.789
Claimed to have a formula
that stops the aging process.

25:30.862 --> 25:33.228
Oh, you didn't happen
to buy any, did you?

25:33.298 --> 25:35.289
lt was only
a tripolymer enzyme.

25:35.367 --> 25:37.358
Makes great
shoe polish, though.

25:37.469 --> 25:38.436
Moving on.

25:39.604 --> 25:40.969
Your second stop.

25:45.777 --> 25:47.870
Tarakis.

25:53.285 --> 25:55.776
The planet, it's called Tarakis.

25:56.955 --> 25:58.684
l've been here.

26:33.692 --> 26:35.284
What the hell
are you doing?!

26:35.360 --> 26:36.292
Stand aside.

26:36.361 --> 26:37.521
They're already dead!

26:37.596 --> 26:38.688
They were never here.

26:38.763 --> 26:40.253
We disabled their
shield generators,

26:40.332 --> 26:42.562
entered the colony
and they were gone.

26:42.634 --> 26:44.761
No one's going
to believe that.

26:44.869 --> 26:46.632
They will if we all
keep to the same story.

26:46.738 --> 26:48.228
l won't lie about
what happened here.

26:48.340 --> 26:49.671
Then you say nothing.

26:49.741 --> 26:51.038
We murdered these people!

26:51.109 --> 26:52.235
ln self-defense!

26:52.310 --> 26:53.538
lf that were true, you wouldn't

26:53.612 --> 26:54.704
be vaporizing the evidence!

26:54.779 --> 26:56.508
You don't have
to listen to him.

26:56.581 --> 26:58.242
We've got to let people know.

26:58.316 --> 27:00.079
We panicked!
They'll understand!

27:00.151 --> 27:01.083
No, they won't!

27:01.152 --> 27:02.119
Move away.

27:02.187 --> 27:03.154
l said

27:03.221 --> 27:04.085
move away!

27:25.076 --> 27:26.873
How long have l been here?

27:27.012 --> 27:28.309
Three hours.

27:28.380 --> 27:31.372
You started hallucinating
in Astrometrics.

27:31.449 --> 27:33.940
l'm afraid l had to sedate you.

27:35.887 --> 27:37.377
l was there.

27:37.455 --> 27:41.789
l was at the colony...

27:41.860 --> 27:43.657
with Saavdra.

27:43.728 --> 27:45.491
You're not the only one.

27:45.563 --> 27:47.827
39 crew members
have begun to experience

27:47.899 --> 27:50.060
the same memories.

27:50.168 --> 27:51.430
lt appears
that the entire crew

27:51.536 --> 27:53.629
has been affected.

28:12.123 --> 28:14.148
Their symptoms are identical--

28:14.225 --> 28:19.128
increased engramatic
activity, nightmares.

28:19.197 --> 28:21.131
l can imagine the away team

28:21.199 --> 28:23.463
being pulled
into an alien conflict.

28:23.568 --> 28:27.504
But these people weren't
anywhere near this system.

28:27.605 --> 28:30.472
We've analyzed Voyager's
sensor records.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.134
lf we did participate
in a war,

28:32.210 --> 28:34.735
all evidence of it
has been erased.

28:34.813 --> 28:36.872
The dream was so vivid--

28:37.015 --> 28:38.505
as real as anything

28:38.583 --> 28:40.778
l've experienced.

28:40.852 --> 28:43.912
But l refuse to believe
that we could...

28:45.790 --> 28:47.348
Real or not, the memories

28:47.425 --> 28:49.723
are having a deleterious effect
on the crew.

28:49.794 --> 28:52.820
The syndrome began to spread
once we entered this system.

28:52.897 --> 28:54.865
l suggest we reverse course,

28:54.933 --> 28:56.400
before it gets worse.

28:56.501 --> 29:02.235
No. lf this massacre really
happened, someone is to blame.

29:02.307 --> 29:05.071
l want to be certain
that it wasn't us.

29:05.143 --> 29:07.077
With all due respect,
your judgment

29:07.145 --> 29:09.079
may be clouded by
feelings of guilt

29:09.147 --> 29:11.411
about an incident
that never occurred.

29:11.483 --> 29:12.780
The danger to our crew

29:12.851 --> 29:16.480
here and now, is indisputable.

29:16.554 --> 29:20.012
l've seen you
looking better, Ensign.

29:20.091 --> 29:22.355
Yes, ma'am.

29:22.427 --> 29:25.225
l've felt better myself,

29:25.296 --> 29:27.890
but we're going
to get through this.

29:39.911 --> 29:41.708
The massacre took
place on Tarakis.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.372
Go to Red Alert
and set a course.

29:43.448 --> 29:44.380
Aye, Captain.

29:44.449 --> 29:45.780
A neural suppressant.

29:45.850 --> 29:48.512
lt'll help keep
the memories from resurfacing.

30:02.300 --> 30:04.063
Your favorites--

30:04.169 --> 30:07.161
Talaxian stew
and terra nut soufflé.

30:07.272 --> 30:08.830
The soufflé
has collapsed slightly,

30:08.940 --> 30:10.805
but its nutritional content
is intact.

30:10.875 --> 30:13.173
Thank you.

30:13.244 --> 30:14.905
lt looks delicious.

30:16.514 --> 30:20.280
When Naomi Wildman is sad,
she consumes desserts.

30:20.351 --> 30:23.650
She claims it improves
her emotional state.

30:23.721 --> 30:25.279
Perhaps you should try it.

30:25.356 --> 30:27.256
Naomi must be terrified of me...

30:27.325 --> 30:29.452
after what happened
in the galley.

30:29.527 --> 30:32.189
She's concerned about you.

30:32.263 --> 30:34.254
She told me she wants
to visit you.

30:34.332 --> 30:38.860
No, not like this.

30:38.970 --> 30:41.632
l might do something
to scare her again.

30:41.739 --> 30:43.934
l'll give her your regards.

30:46.978 --> 30:48.206
Seven...

30:52.750 --> 30:54.308
When you were a Borg,

30:54.385 --> 30:59.516
you were involved in some...
unpleasant activities.

30:59.591 --> 31:01.718
l helped to assimilate millions.

31:01.826 --> 31:04.590
l don't mean to be insensitive,

31:04.629 --> 31:11.728
but... do you ever feel shame
about what you did?

31:11.836 --> 31:12.894
Frequently.

31:13.071 --> 31:15.699
How do you manage
to keep going,

31:15.807 --> 31:19.868
knowing that you've done
such horrible things?

31:19.944 --> 31:21.639
l have no choice.

31:23.348 --> 31:24.781
Guilt is irrelevant?

31:24.849 --> 31:28.216
On the contrary,
my feelings of remorse

31:28.286 --> 31:30.686
help me remember what l did

31:30.755 --> 31:33.315
and prevent me from taking
similar actions in the future.

31:35.426 --> 31:38.884
Guilt can be a difficult
but useful emotion.

31:42.533 --> 31:45.525
lt's certainly difficult.

31:49.073 --> 31:53.009
ls that chocolate mixed in there
with the terra nuts?

31:53.144 --> 31:55.544
l altered the recipe slightly.

31:55.613 --> 31:57.513
l hope you don't object.

31:57.582 --> 32:00.813
Not at all.

32:15.300 --> 32:16.767
Tarakis, dead ahead.

32:16.868 --> 32:17.766
Shields.

32:17.869 --> 32:19.803
Stand by weapons.

32:19.871 --> 32:20.838
On screen.

32:21.940 --> 32:25.205
Scan for vessels.

32:25.276 --> 32:27.073
There are none.

32:27.145 --> 32:29.477
Take us into orbit.

32:29.547 --> 32:30.946
Ma'am?

32:31.082 --> 32:32.413
Do it, Mr. Paris.

32:41.559 --> 32:43.083
Life signs?

32:43.161 --> 32:45.857
The planet appears
to be uninhabited.

32:45.930 --> 32:47.363
Looks the same as it did
a few days ago,

32:47.432 --> 32:48.865
when we scanned
for dilithium deposits.

32:48.933 --> 32:51.094
Signs of weapons fire
or phaser residue?

32:51.202 --> 32:52.260
Negative.

32:52.370 --> 32:55.635
Run a full spectral scan.

32:55.707 --> 32:57.470
Look for anything unusual.

32:57.542 --> 33:00.511
Nothing on geometric sensors.

33:00.578 --> 33:01.510
Hold on.

33:01.579 --> 33:03.206
l'm picking up
a power signature.

33:03.281 --> 33:04.976
-Source?
-l can't tell.

33:05.049 --> 33:06.414
The signal's erratic,

33:06.484 --> 33:09.715
but it's coming
from the northernmost continent,

33:09.787 --> 33:11.015
coordinates 172

33:11.089 --> 33:13.148
mark 5.

33:25.937 --> 33:27.404
Phasers.

33:39.450 --> 33:40.883
Call it an educated guess,

33:40.952 --> 33:44.115
but l don't think this
looks like a war zone.

33:44.188 --> 33:45.883
There's something familiar
about it though.

33:45.957 --> 33:47.891
l recognize those mountains.

33:47.959 --> 33:50.189
Those trees weren't here.

33:50.261 --> 33:51.956
Search the area.

34:14.318 --> 34:16.513
Ensign?

34:16.587 --> 34:18.487
The tunnel.

34:18.556 --> 34:20.820
lt's nearby.

34:20.891 --> 34:22.985
The one where l, uh...

34:24.629 --> 34:26.290
How'd you get into it?

34:26.364 --> 34:28.491
There was a rock formation.

34:28.565 --> 34:30.090
lt hid the opening.

34:38.676 --> 34:41.143
A faint energy signature.

34:44.514 --> 34:46.277
This way.

35:04.368 --> 35:06.336
Over here.

35:26.290 --> 35:27.723
There's your
physical evidence.

35:27.792 --> 35:30.056
l suggest we proceed
with caution.

35:30.128 --> 35:31.925
Stand guard.

36:04.729 --> 36:06.253
l... l... l can't.

36:06.330 --> 36:08.298
Remain calm.

36:08.366 --> 36:11.631
Slow, deep breaths.

36:42.800 --> 36:45.098
They were over there.

36:58.282 --> 37:00.182
l found the remains
of two humanoids,

37:00.284 --> 37:02.912
but you were not responsible
for their deaths.

37:04.488 --> 37:07.582
They died over 300 years ago.

38:04.348 --> 38:06.976
l think we found our war.

38:12.857 --> 38:16.020
The structure contains
a synaptic transmitter.

38:16.093 --> 38:17.025
l believe it was designed

38:17.094 --> 38:18.823
to send neurogenic pulses

38:18.963 --> 38:20.658
throughout this system.

38:20.731 --> 38:22.358
So anyone passing through

38:22.433 --> 38:24.526
would experience
the Nakan massacre...

38:24.635 --> 38:25.761
like we did.

38:25.870 --> 38:27.269
Precisely.

38:27.338 --> 38:30.171
Try running those symbols
inscribed on the base

38:30.241 --> 38:32.175
through the translation matrix.

38:35.813 --> 38:38.873
''Words alone cannot
convey the suffering.

38:38.949 --> 38:40.473
''Words alone cannot prevent

38:40.551 --> 38:42.883
''what happened here
from happening again.

38:42.987 --> 38:45.888
''Beyond words lies experience.

38:45.990 --> 38:49.084
''Beyond experience lies truth.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.560
''Make this truth

38:51.629 --> 38:53.028
your own.''

38:53.097 --> 38:56.225
lt's a memorial.

38:56.334 --> 38:59.235
We weren't victims
of a conspiracy.

38:59.303 --> 39:01.396
We were witnesses to a massacre.

39:01.505 --> 39:02.938
More than witnesses.

39:03.007 --> 39:04.804
By being forced
to relive those events,

39:04.875 --> 39:06.399
half the crew's
been traumatized.

39:06.510 --> 39:08.171
Maybe that was the point.

39:08.245 --> 39:11.180
l certainly won't forget
what happened here.

39:11.248 --> 39:14.308
Anything in that database
that might tell us who built

39:14.385 --> 39:15.511
this thing?

39:15.586 --> 39:17.520
No. The technology
has been neglected

39:17.588 --> 39:19.180
for more than two centuries.

39:19.256 --> 39:21.190
lts power cells
are deteriorating.

39:21.258 --> 39:22.486
That could explain

39:22.560 --> 39:25.051
why our memories
were so fragmented.

39:25.129 --> 39:26.528
lt was probably designed

39:26.597 --> 39:28.827
to transmit the experience
in sequence.

39:28.933 --> 39:31.128
Fascinating.
Now let's try to shut it down

39:31.235 --> 39:33.260
so nobody else
has to go through this.

39:35.373 --> 39:36.635
Kathryn?

39:38.175 --> 39:39.472
Yes, of course.

39:41.312 --> 39:44.509
Even if we do shut down
the transmitter,

39:44.582 --> 39:47.608
l'm afraid your memories
of the massacre are permanent.

39:47.685 --> 39:49.243
But we'll prevent this
from happening

39:49.320 --> 39:50.412
to other passing ships.

39:50.488 --> 39:51.887
lf we do that, all record

39:51.989 --> 39:54.116
of what happened here
would be lost.

39:54.191 --> 39:55.749
The monument
will still be here.

39:55.826 --> 39:57.885
But that doesn't really
tell the story.

39:57.995 --> 39:59.986
Someone put a lot
of time and care

40:00.064 --> 40:01.588
into building
that transmitter.

40:01.665 --> 40:02.689
We can't just

40:02.767 --> 40:03.699
deactivate it.

40:03.801 --> 40:04.995
We don't have the right.

40:05.102 --> 40:07.536
Did they have the right
to force us to relive all that?

40:07.605 --> 40:10.301
They wanted others to know
what it was like, in the hopes

40:10.374 --> 40:11.705
that nothing like it
would happen again.

40:11.776 --> 40:13.334
Why should anyone
have to experience

40:13.411 --> 40:15.140
an atrocity they didn't commit?

40:15.212 --> 40:18.648
Because that's how you learn
not to make the same mistake.

40:18.716 --> 40:22.152
lf we destroy the evidence,
we're no better than Saavdra.

40:22.219 --> 40:23.481
Maybe he had a point.

40:23.554 --> 40:25.146
lt wasn't our fault.

40:25.222 --> 40:26.280
Given the danger
involved,

40:26.357 --> 40:27.847
it's only logical...

40:27.925 --> 40:29.222
This isn't about logic!

40:29.293 --> 40:30.658
lt's about remembering!

40:30.728 --> 40:32.195
Some things are best forgotten.

40:32.263 --> 40:33.230
Not this.

40:35.166 --> 40:37.862
l stood by once before
and did nothing.

40:37.968 --> 40:38.957
Not again.

40:39.103 --> 40:40.297
Captain?

40:40.404 --> 40:42.565
l watched while Saavdra
vaporized the bodies.

40:42.673 --> 40:47.007
No offense, but those were
other people's memories.

40:47.111 --> 40:49.170
The Obelisk at Khitomer,

40:49.246 --> 40:50.406
the fields at Gettysburg,

40:50.481 --> 40:52.415
those were other people's
memories, too,

40:52.483 --> 40:54.212
but we don't
honor them any less.

40:54.285 --> 40:58.016
The 82 colonists
who died here...

40:59.723 --> 41:01.486
they deserve their memorial.

41:01.592 --> 41:03.184
Captain...

41:03.227 --> 41:05.388
We're not going to shut down
the transmitter. ls that clear?

41:07.431 --> 41:09.194
ls that clear?

41:09.266 --> 41:11.097
Are you suggesting

41:11.202 --> 41:12.169
we leave it intact?

41:12.236 --> 41:14.761
l'm suggesting
that we repair it.

41:14.872 --> 41:16.499
Recharge the power cells.

41:16.607 --> 41:17.938
l want that monument

41:18.008 --> 41:20.875
to function properly
for another 300 years.

41:20.945 --> 41:23.072
We'll place
a warning buoy in orbit.

41:23.147 --> 41:26.548
Anyone who enters this system
will know what to expect.

41:27.918 --> 41:29.283
Dismissed.

42:13.597 --> 42:15.224
We're ready, Captain.

42:19.169 --> 42:22.138
l know this was hardest
on the four of you,

42:22.239 --> 42:25.106
but if you hadn't
stopped at this planet,

42:25.175 --> 42:29.168
all the people who died here
would have been forgotten.

42:29.246 --> 42:33.239
And if they could,
l know they'd thank you.

42:34.885 --> 42:36.750
Janeway to Voyager.

42:36.820 --> 42:39.414
Stand by to initiate
power transfer.

42:41.959 --> 42:43.688
Five to beam up.

42:44.305 --> 42:50.672
