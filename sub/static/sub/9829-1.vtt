01:15.612 --> 01:20.367
Give me land, lots of land
under starry skies above....

01:32.092 --> 01:36.244
Let me be by myself in the evening breeze

01:36.612 --> 01:40.400
Listen to the murmur
of the cottonwood trees

01:40.492 --> 01:42.164
Send me off forever

01:42.252 --> 01:44.243
But I ask you please

01:44.452 --> 01:46.568
Don't fence me in

01:47.092 --> 01:49.003
Just turn me loose

01:49.092 --> 01:50.969
Let me straddle my own saddle

01:51.052 --> 01:53.566
Underneath the western skies

01:53.652 --> 01:54.721
Oo-oo

01:54.812 --> 01:56.882
On my cayuse

01:56.972 --> 01:59.088
Let me wander over yonder

01:59.172 --> 02:00.969
Till I see the mountains rise

02:01.052 --> 02:02.690
Oo-oo-oo-oo

02:02.772 --> 02:08.244
I want to ride to the ridge
where the West commences

02:08.372 --> 02:12.047
Gaze at the moon until I lose my senses

02:12.132 --> 02:15.966
Can't look at hobbles
and I can't stand fences

02:16.052 --> 02:18.043
Don't fence me in

02:18.772 --> 02:20.728
Just turn me loose

02:20.812 --> 02:22.689
Let me straddle my own saddle

02:22.772 --> 02:24.967
Underneath the western skies

02:25.052 --> 02:27.043
Oo-oo

02:28.212 --> 02:29.804
On...

02:30.652 --> 02:32.244
Hey!

02:32.652 --> 02:33.880
Hey!

02:34.572 --> 02:35.687
Come back here.

02:35.772 --> 02:37.364
Hey!

02:37.772 --> 02:39.763
Hey!

02:40.372 --> 02:42.363
I hate that when you do that!

02:42.452 --> 02:44.170
I was bored to death.

02:44.252 --> 02:46.208
Well, I was having fun.

02:46.292 --> 02:48.123
Well, good for you.

02:48.212 --> 02:50.328
- Get in!
- No, I'm grabbing a cab.

02:50.412 --> 02:51.731
Get in!

02:51.812 --> 02:53.404
Stop it!

02:53.492 --> 02:55.483
Leave me alone, Eddie.

02:56.172 --> 02:59.403
Don't ever try that again...

03:00.172 --> 03:01.969
.. or else!

03:02.052 --> 03:03.849
Or else what?

03:43.612 --> 03:47.525
Mr. Yoshida says,
"We regret we can go no further. "

03:47.612 --> 03:49.921
"This is our final proposal. "

03:50.012 --> 03:53.800
"Your company will benefit greatly
from this new relationship. "

03:53.892 --> 03:56.850
"Now you must decide the fate of MicroCon. "

03:56.932 --> 03:59.446
We should close at this price.

03:59.532 --> 04:02.251
Let's see if we can hold out
till Congress votes.

04:02.332 --> 04:04.209
We can't pull back just now.

04:04.292 --> 04:06.283
Deal's too far gone.

04:06.372 --> 04:09.523
We can't pull back just now.
Deal's too far gone.

04:09.612 --> 04:14.049
- They'll suspect if we stall.
- They'll suspect if we stall.

04:14.132 --> 04:18.171
Listen, I'm the last guy
who wants to screw this up.

04:18.252 --> 04:22.165
Deal's too good,
but we have to have some strategy.

04:22.252 --> 04:24.971
That's what I'm saying.

04:28.812 --> 04:31.007
They're going to stall.

04:50.652 --> 04:52.244
Hey, guys.

04:52.732 --> 04:54.723
- How's it going?
- Good.

04:56.052 --> 04:59.203
If there's anything you don't understand...

04:59.292 --> 05:01.203
Oh, no. We're uh...

05:01.292 --> 05:03.931
- We're fine.
- Great. That's good to hear.

05:04.012 --> 05:06.242
You're gonna be part of a great team.

05:06.332 --> 05:10.530
Once these guys draw
a line in the sand, that's pretty much it.

05:10.612 --> 05:13.843
You want that research and development
money, don't you?

05:13.932 --> 05:15.923
Nakamoto Group can do a lot for you.

05:16.012 --> 05:17.923
- Yeah, right.
- Great.

05:18.732 --> 05:20.609
That guy is an asshole.

05:20.932 --> 05:22.923
That guy is an asshole.

05:23.652 --> 05:28.521
The deal will put vital elements of our
military weaponry under Japanese control.

05:28.612 --> 05:32.002
Come on, Senator Morton.
That's really a scare tactic.

05:32.092 --> 05:36.927
During the Gulf War, the Japanese suggested
they could deny us that weaponry. In fact...

05:37.012 --> 05:39.924
- You're oversimplifying a complex issue.
- No...

05:40.012 --> 05:45.644
He's trying to say America is looking for
a new enemy now the Cold War is over.

05:45.732 --> 05:47.529
Talk about simplifying!

05:47.612 --> 05:50.649
You're doing the simplifying, Senator.

05:54.412 --> 05:55.845
Hold on.

05:55.932 --> 05:58.969
Let's let... Eleanor, let the Senator in, please.

05:59.052 --> 06:01.043
I came here to Los Angeles because...

06:01.132 --> 06:05.887
Before we hear that, I couldn't detect
exactly how you're going to vote.

06:05.972 --> 06:09.442
- You know, they warned me about you.
- Well, they should!

06:09.532 --> 06:10.567
They should!

06:10.652 --> 06:13.724
- How are you going to vote?
- Against the sale of MicroCon.

06:13.812 --> 06:16.042
Thank you for saying that flat out.

06:16.132 --> 06:18.202
Let me ask you guys on this side.

06:18.292 --> 06:22.888
You sometimes make it sound as if
Japan's prosperity is bad for America.

06:22.972 --> 06:24.610
Is that what you mean?

06:24.692 --> 06:29.720
The real issue is that this technology
is paid for by American taxpayers...

06:50.452 --> 06:55.924
This discussion is degenerating
into the kind of argument we don't need.

06:56.012 --> 06:59.288
This is already a very tense situation.

06:59.372 --> 07:02.250
There will soon be a vote
in Congress and we will decide...

07:02.332 --> 07:04.527
.. whether the MicroCon sale goes through.

07:10.212 --> 07:12.407
I don't get you, Eddie.

07:12.492 --> 07:14.483
So what?

07:28.612 --> 07:30.603
Oh, ladies, one thing.

07:31.052 --> 07:36.126
Do remember that the custom here
is bow when you're bowed to.

07:36.692 --> 07:39.650
Oh, wow!
They really rolled out the red carpet.

07:41.932 --> 07:44.810
- What floor are we going to?
- 45th.

07:44.892 --> 07:47.884
- After you, Greg.
- Thank you, Rick.

07:55.892 --> 07:57.803
Yokasai Irasshaimase.

07:57.892 --> 08:00.486
Bow when you're bowed to.

08:00.572 --> 08:03.962
- Oh, wow! Look at this. Everybody's here.
- This is amazing!

08:04.052 --> 08:06.247
There's Barry Hirsch. The Mayor.

08:06.332 --> 08:10.245
- We're in the fast lane now.
- Oh, we sure are.

08:10.932 --> 08:15.005
- Look, here's Yoshida-san and the boys.
- Get ready to bow.

08:17.732 --> 08:19.131
Wife.

08:32.772 --> 08:35.047
- Taiko drums!
- Huh?

08:35.131 --> 08:39.886
Taiko drums. Long ago
they were used to drive away evil spirits.

09:11.692 --> 09:13.683
Come here.

09:24.052 --> 09:26.043
No, here.

10:49.612 --> 10:51.091
Yes.

11:08.252 --> 11:10.243
Yes...

11:13.452 --> 11:15.443
Yes... More...

11:15.532 --> 11:17.523
Ah, yes...

11:18.692 --> 11:21.126
Yo, what's up?

11:21.212 --> 11:25.524
Web. Tom Graham. You're on the chart
tonight, Special Services liaison.

11:25.612 --> 11:27.603
- Yeah, yeah.
- Better get over here.

11:27.692 --> 11:30.252
The new Nakamoto building. 1100 Figueroa.

11:30.332 --> 11:33.563
- I can't believe they're pulling this shit.
- What stuff?

11:33.652 --> 11:36.564
Demanding to see
the fuckin' Special Services liaison.

11:36.652 --> 11:40.531
They say the police can't proceed
until you get here.

11:40.612 --> 11:44.127
And what time
was that phone call from Lieutenant Graham?

11:44.212 --> 11:46.203
What time?

11:46.692 --> 11:48.842
Yes. What time was it?

11:48.932 --> 11:50.923
9.00pm.

11:51.612 --> 11:53.330
February 9th.

11:53.412 --> 11:56.006
Four nights ago?

11:58.532 --> 12:00.523
Was that a yes, Lieutenant Smith?

12:00.612 --> 12:02.762
Yeah. It's a yeah.

12:04.372 --> 12:07.648
Lieutenant Smith,
we appreciate your cooperation.

12:07.732 --> 12:11.771
You waived your right
to be represented here by an attorney.

12:11.852 --> 12:16.846
So... Lieutenant Graham called for
the Special Services liaison.

12:18.852 --> 12:21.366
He said he had a homicide.

12:21.452 --> 12:24.125
Yeah, a homicide. Apparent 601.

12:24.212 --> 12:27.090
Caucasian female, I'd say 25.

12:27.412 --> 12:31.690
Lying flat on her back on the boardroom table
like a piece of sushi.

12:31.772 --> 12:35.003
Quite a sight. Better get down here.

12:37.452 --> 12:42.321
Hello. I'm a police officer.
Can I be of assistance?

12:43.092 --> 12:46.767
Konnichiwa. Watashi wa keisatsu kan desu.

12:47.652 --> 12:51.327
Konnichiwa. Watashi wa keisatsu kan desu.

12:54.652 --> 12:58.247
May I see your passport?
Pasuporto misete kudosai.

12:58.332 --> 13:01.961
Pasuporto, misha shugas...
mish shuga... nasai.

13:05.452 --> 13:08.603
- What's up?
- This is Watch Commander Hoffman.

13:08.692 --> 13:10.683
Yes, sir.

13:10.772 --> 13:14.208
You're on your way to Nakamoto Towers.
I want you to pick someone up.

13:14.292 --> 13:16.681
- Certainly, sir.
- A guy named Connor.

13:16.772 --> 13:19.240
- Connor?
- Yeah, John Connor.

13:19.852 --> 13:22.446
But I thought... he was long gone.

13:22.532 --> 13:25.604
No, he's very much alive.
They put in a request for him.

13:25.692 --> 13:28.411
- They? Who's they?
- You go. I'll phone him.

13:28.492 --> 13:31.928
- He lives by Little Tokyo. 428 Rose Street.
- Yes, sir.

13:52.012 --> 13:54.003
428 Rose Street.

14:14.452 --> 14:16.443
Connor?

14:22.292 --> 14:25.648
And you did not know
Captain Connor prior to this night?

14:25.732 --> 14:27.609
No, I did not.

14:27.692 --> 14:30.206
- I'd only heard about him.
- What had you heard?

14:30.292 --> 14:34.285
I heard that he had long ago
put himself on indefinite leave.

14:34.372 --> 14:38.160
That he had lived in Japan.
Some people thought they got to him.

14:38.252 --> 14:39.844
Some people said that...

14:40.612 --> 14:42.762
Said what?

14:42.852 --> 14:45.241
The man couldn't be trusted.

14:46.172 --> 14:47.764
You're late.

14:48.852 --> 14:50.080
Yeah, sorry.

14:50.172 --> 14:52.163
- The directions were...
- No.

14:52.652 --> 14:54.643
Be on time.

15:04.012 --> 15:05.491
Shoes.

15:17.452 --> 15:22.082
Is it normal procedure now for the Japanese
to demand a liaison officer?

15:22.172 --> 15:24.686
No. It's usually an assignment.

15:24.772 --> 15:26.524
What time were you called?

15:26.612 --> 15:29.331
Lieutenant Graham called at nine.
Hoffman called in the car.

15:29.412 --> 15:31.642
You were called twice?

15:31.732 --> 15:33.450
Yeah.

15:33.532 --> 15:35.921
I wish I'd known that sooner.

15:39.092 --> 15:41.481
Have you negotiated with the Japanese?

15:41.572 --> 15:43.290
Negotiated?

15:43.372 --> 15:46.762
Mm. Perhaps I can suggest the strategy.

15:46.852 --> 15:48.888
Well, this is hardly a negotiation.

15:48.972 --> 15:51.566
Oh? What is it, then?

15:53.572 --> 15:55.369
What is it?

15:55.452 --> 15:57.124
It's a homicide.

15:59.452 --> 16:03.331
When we arrive,
you take charge of the negotiations.

16:03.412 --> 16:05.642
Don't introduce me or refer to me.

16:05.732 --> 16:08.007
Don't even look in my direction.

16:08.092 --> 16:13.212
Keep your jacket buttoned at all times.
If they bow, you bow back.

16:13.292 --> 16:15.806
Believe it or not, I have done this before.

16:15.892 --> 16:17.883
You know, I do know these things.

16:17.972 --> 16:20.247
Do keep your hands at your sides.

16:20.332 --> 16:23.927
The Japanese find
big arm movements threatening.

16:24.532 --> 16:26.443
Keep your voice calm and even.

16:26.532 --> 16:29.490
You'll probably find them irritating tonight.

16:29.572 --> 16:32.291
But whatever happens,
don't lose your temper.

16:32.372 --> 16:34.328
I don't lose my temper.

16:34.412 --> 16:36.403
That's good to know.

16:36.492 --> 16:39.131
When you start to get into trouble...

16:39.212 --> 16:41.123
I won't get into trouble.

16:41.212 --> 16:44.124
When you start to get into trouble,...

16:44.212 --> 16:47.841
.. I will say, "Perhaps I can be of assistance?"

16:48.772 --> 16:50.922
From then on, I do the talking.

16:51.012 --> 16:54.561
You stand behind me.
And don't appear distracted.

16:54.652 --> 16:59.203
We may come from a fragmented,
MTV, rap-video culture, but they do not.

16:59.292 --> 17:04.127
Every aspect of your appearance
and behaviour will reflect on you,...

17:04.212 --> 17:06.851
.. the Department, and me as your sempai.

17:06.932 --> 17:08.923
- My sempai?
- Mm.

17:09.012 --> 17:11.127
That wouldn't be massa, would it?

17:13.452 --> 17:19.721
No. The sempai is the senior man
who guides the junior man, the kohai.

17:21.692 --> 17:25.605
In Japan, the sempai-kohai relationship
is presumed to exist...

17:25.692 --> 17:28.764
.. when the younger man and the older man
work together.

17:28.852 --> 17:31.844
Hopefully, they will presume that of us.

17:39.132 --> 17:42.647
So what does it mean
that I was called twice?

17:42.732 --> 17:44.723
It means they're ahead of us.

17:44.812 --> 17:47.849
For all they know,
I could have been five minutes away.

17:47.932 --> 17:51.971
They know who was on call tonight,
how long it would take you to get here.

17:52.052 --> 17:54.043
They know all about you.

17:54.132 --> 17:56.123
- All about me?
- Mm.

17:57.532 --> 18:00.126
- It took you long enough.
- Tom.

18:03.052 --> 18:05.168
What the fuck's he doing here?

18:05.252 --> 18:07.402
Fred Hoffman told me to bring him.

18:07.492 --> 18:09.483
The guy is trouble. Watch out.

18:09.572 --> 18:13.451
The Department put him on leave
because he's too close to Japan.

18:13.532 --> 18:16.604
- He's not a team player.
- Where is everybody?

18:16.692 --> 18:19.081
They made us put our cars around back.

18:19.172 --> 18:22.960
They keep saying
nothing must disrupt the grand opening.

18:23.052 --> 18:26.408
Finding that blonde piece of sushi
drove them nuts.

18:26.492 --> 18:29.484
Don't want their guests or the press to know.

18:31.492 --> 18:33.483
Step aside, pal.

18:34.132 --> 18:36.726
- You come down already.
- Yeah?

18:36.812 --> 18:38.723
Well, now I go back up.

18:38.812 --> 18:42.088
Maybe come down, go up 10 times more. OK?

18:45.652 --> 18:49.645
We're still the fuckin' police
in our own country.

18:50.972 --> 18:53.566
Built this building in six months.

18:53.652 --> 18:58.168
Prefab units from Japan, slapped 'em
together here. Not one American worker.

18:58.252 --> 19:01.244
City gave 'em an eight-year break
on property taxes.

19:01.332 --> 19:03.607
Shit! We're giving this country away.

19:03.692 --> 19:05.444
Nobody forced us to do it.

19:09.292 --> 19:10.884
Jesus!

19:10.972 --> 19:15.329
If an elevator's gonna talk, it should
speak in American. What did it say?

19:15.412 --> 19:18.051
We're arriving at the 45th floor.

19:19.652 --> 19:21.165
No, no. Wait a second.

19:21.252 --> 19:26.007
The Japanese provide jobs here,
but US companies are moving jobs offshore.

19:26.092 --> 19:28.083
Ground floor, please.

19:28.172 --> 19:30.163
- They must...
- Going up, Senator.

19:30.252 --> 19:33.801
- No, no. I wish to go down.
- Get the next one, Senator.

19:33.892 --> 19:35.883
Come on.

19:38.452 --> 19:41.762
No, no, no. You don't understand!

19:43.052 --> 19:44.804
Senator Morton.

19:44.892 --> 19:47.486
Real nice to find him partying here,...

19:47.572 --> 19:52.282
.. considering he's on the committee
which sets all import regulations.

19:53.812 --> 19:55.803
Geronimo!

19:56.412 --> 19:58.403
Coming through!

20:14.932 --> 20:17.207
I have your liaison for you.

20:17.492 --> 20:19.528
Konbanwa. Hajimemashite.

20:19.612 --> 20:21.364
Hajimemashite.

20:21.452 --> 20:23.920
Watashi wa Sumisu desu. Dozo.

20:24.532 --> 20:27.410
Watashi wa Ishihara desu. Dozo.

20:27.532 --> 20:30.524
Is this your home phone, Detective?

20:31.132 --> 20:33.930
Yes. Right there at the bottom.

20:34.012 --> 20:36.845
Detective, let's dispense with the formalities.

20:36.932 --> 20:40.447
We'd like to cooperate,
but you can't start without a warrant.

20:40.532 --> 20:44.161
- Bullshit. We don't need one.
- We can get one in 15 minutes.

20:44.252 --> 20:48.325
- But we do have a reported homicide here.
- More likely a drug overdose.

20:48.412 --> 20:50.642
We can't know that until we investigate.

20:50.732 --> 20:52.131
Obviously.

20:52.212 --> 20:56.888
But I'm concerned about the attempt
to link this death to our reception downstairs.

20:56.972 --> 21:00.965
I don't know, sir.
Looks like she's wearing a party dress.

21:01.052 --> 21:02.690
She is, I agree.

21:02.772 --> 21:06.651
Lieutenant, you have to appreciate
the position of the Nakamoto Corporation.

21:06.732 --> 21:09.724
- Sir, I...
- This is an important evening for us.

21:09.812 --> 21:11.803
A very public evening.

21:11.892 --> 21:16.010
We don't want it marred by the death
of a woman of no importance.

21:16.092 --> 21:18.242
- Of no importance?
- You have some nerve!

21:18.332 --> 21:21.688
- I can't imagine how she came to be in here.
- You have some nerve!

21:21.772 --> 21:25.003
Your Lieutenant Graham intends
to interrogate everybody,...

21:25.092 --> 21:27.652
.. the Mayor, the Senators, and Congressmen.

21:27.732 --> 21:29.768
Graham said that?

21:31.012 --> 21:33.731
Oh, Christ! What is this?

21:33.812 --> 21:35.882
Do you mind turning around?

21:35.972 --> 21:38.805
- Who is he?
- Mr. Tanaka works for Nakamoto Security.

21:38.892 --> 21:42.282
- Get him outta here!
- We have authorised him to be here.

21:42.372 --> 21:46.081
I'm authorising him out!
He's contaminating the area. And get his film!

21:46.172 --> 21:51.405
- We must undertake our own private inquiry.
- I'll get you a warrant and a restraining order!

21:51.492 --> 21:53.881
Do that! Be my guest!

21:54.052 --> 21:58.364
Excuse me.
Perhaps uh... I can be of assistance.

22:03.932 --> 22:06.810
Hajimemashite. John Connor desu.

22:12.812 --> 22:14.803
John Connor-san.

22:17.812 --> 22:19.803
Watashi wa Ishihara.

22:22.012 --> 22:26.767
Ishihara-san, I'm sure none of your guests
are involved in this unfortunate incident.

22:26.852 --> 22:28.843
They are free to go as they wish.

22:30.092 --> 22:32.560
I am grateful for your assistance.

22:32.652 --> 22:37.282
But before they leave, give me
the names of those gentlemen, please.

22:38.052 --> 22:39.690
I'm sorry.

22:39.772 --> 22:42.491
The names of those gentlemen.

22:44.012 --> 22:46.003
May I ask why?

22:53.412 --> 22:56.882
- Ritchie! Mug shots! All of them!
- You cannot do this!

22:58.332 --> 23:00.641
No! You are to blame here!

23:00.732 --> 23:02.927
You will assist my detectives!

23:03.012 --> 23:05.401
And I want to know who discovered the body!

23:06.772 --> 23:08.763
And don't you fuck with me!

23:11.692 --> 23:14.684
But of course,... Captain.

23:18.012 --> 23:20.003
Yeah, don't fuck with us.

23:20.092 --> 23:23.641
Mount up, boys. Let's get it done
before she starts to smell.

23:23.732 --> 23:28.726
- Isn't it bad form to lose your temper?
- It is. But I had to, to assist Ishihara.

23:28.812 --> 23:30.484
Assist Ishihara?

23:30.572 --> 23:32.961
Now why would you wanna do that?

23:33.052 --> 23:35.520
He wasn't the most important man
in the room.

23:35.612 --> 23:38.001
- Oh, he wasn't?
- No. It was the older man.

23:38.772 --> 23:40.967
His juyaku, his superior.

23:41.052 --> 23:46.809
But I wanted to get the investigation going
so I played the out-of-control gaijin.

23:46.892 --> 23:49.167
So Ishihara wouldn't lose face.

23:53.332 --> 23:56.130
So now, Ishihara owes me a favour.

23:58.452 --> 24:00.443
Deep, isn't it?

24:00.532 --> 24:02.523
Heavy.

24:07.852 --> 24:09.843
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

24:11.212 --> 24:13.601
The executive fuck chamber.

24:14.252 --> 24:16.925
Oh, man, I like this! I like this!

24:17.452 --> 24:19.886
That's nice. That's nice.

24:19.972 --> 24:22.850
These guys sure know how-to do business.

24:45.052 --> 24:47.043
Hold that.

24:48.292 --> 24:50.567
Her nostrils look like
a margarita glass rim.

24:50.652 --> 24:53.803
- Think she OD'd on coke?
- I don't think so.

24:53.892 --> 24:57.885
We'll get lab values on all fluids.
Some seminal fluid down here.

24:57.972 --> 25:00.361
External genitals are pretty raw.

25:00.452 --> 25:05.242
It looks like forced intercourse,
but I'm not sure she was murdered.

25:05.332 --> 25:08.927
Not sure she was murdered?
Come on, you gotta be kidding me.

25:09.012 --> 25:13.403
The make-up on the neck
covers signs of prior throat injuries.

25:13.492 --> 25:16.450
That suggests a pattern
of repeated cervical trauma.

25:16.532 --> 25:18.807
Could be a case of sexual asphyxia.

25:18.892 --> 25:20.689
She's a gasper.

25:20.772 --> 25:22.763
Which is what?

25:22.852 --> 25:27.209
Individuals sexually aroused by
the hypoxia of near-strangulation.

25:27.292 --> 25:31.888
They ask their partners to strangle them
or suffocate them during sex.

25:31.972 --> 25:34.691
It's easy to make a mistake and go too far.

25:34.772 --> 25:38.003
This looks like death from inhibition to me.

25:38.092 --> 25:41.562
- Instantaneous physiological death.
- Meaning what?

25:41.652 --> 25:43.768
The person just... dies.

25:43.852 --> 25:45.843
Happens with neck or chest injuries.

25:45.932 --> 25:49.368
Had a kid got hit with a baseball.
Fell down dead in the schoolyard.

25:49.452 --> 25:51.886
Yeah. Maybe she got hit with a baseball.

25:51.972 --> 25:53.963
Odds are she was strangled.

25:54.052 --> 25:57.203
But since having sex isn't a felony,
it wouldn't be murder.

25:57.292 --> 26:00.921
Anyway, file in the back of your mind
that maybe she just popped off.

26:01.012 --> 26:05.563
Cheryl Lynn Austin. Age 23.
This says she has a Westwood address,...

26:05.652 --> 26:08.485
.. but she hasn't changed
her Kentucky licence yet.

26:08.572 --> 26:11.564
Japanese cigarettes and credit cards.

26:12.132 --> 26:16.444
Nice tight roll of $100 bills.
Miss Austin's well taken care of.

26:16.532 --> 26:18.682
These little guys eat shit in Tokyo.

26:18.772 --> 26:21.809
Crammed into subways,
working for big companies.

26:21.892 --> 26:24.167
They come here and they're rich and free.

26:24.252 --> 26:26.447
They all want to fuck a Rose Bowl queen.

26:26.532 --> 26:30.241
And then kill the Rose Bowl queen
on the Nakamoto boardroom table?

26:30.332 --> 26:33.324
Call the police and create a scandal?

26:34.812 --> 26:36.803
Is that your theory?

26:36.892 --> 26:38.883
- My theory?
- Mm.

26:38.972 --> 26:43.011
My theory is that these guys
are known perversion freaks.

26:43.092 --> 26:45.242
I got a nose for these things.

26:45.332 --> 26:47.323
I'm sure.

26:51.052 --> 26:53.247
Hey, Spider-san.

26:53.332 --> 26:55.323
Tell your pal they got a contest.

26:55.412 --> 26:57.880
Whoever kisses the most asses
wins a Toyota.

27:00.172 --> 27:02.367
Hey, Graham! Want some sushi?

27:02.452 --> 27:05.649
Nah. If I get a craving for mercury,
I'll eat a thermometer.

27:06.932 --> 27:10.322
In Japan, criminals expect to be caught.

27:11.052 --> 27:13.327
Convictions run about 90%%.

27:14.212 --> 27:18.171
Here, it's closer to 17%%.

27:19.052 --> 27:21.122
They think we're stupid.

27:21.852 --> 27:24.047
They think we're corrupt.

27:24.132 --> 27:26.521
And they're not often wrong.

27:37.692 --> 27:39.683
What the hell are you doing?

27:39.772 --> 27:42.161
Good evening, officers. Can I help you?

27:42.252 --> 27:44.527
Yes, you can. Where are you located?

27:44.612 --> 27:49.049
- Lobby level. Across from the elevators.
- Thank you.

27:49.132 --> 27:51.930
How long
have you been on duty tonight?

27:52.012 --> 27:54.003
About half an hour.

27:54.092 --> 27:56.970
Mr. Tanaka was here when I got here.

27:57.052 --> 27:59.282
Mr. Tanaka? Who's Mr. Tanaka?

27:59.372 --> 28:01.363
He's the head of security.

28:02.412 --> 28:05.882
Mr. Phillips, the 46th floor, the cameras?

28:05.972 --> 28:09.248
I know in Japan
they like to observe their workers...

28:09.332 --> 28:11.971
.. to help them improve their efficiency.

28:12.052 --> 28:15.647
I saw at least four up there. Why so many?

28:23.252 --> 28:25.641
You didn't hear this from me.

28:26.052 --> 28:29.249
I guarantee we didn't hear it from you.

28:30.532 --> 28:35.731
Maybe they put in a couple of new cameras
to observe those negotiations.

28:35.812 --> 28:38.406
What negotiations were those?

28:39.172 --> 28:41.891
The ones that go on up there during the day...

28:41.972 --> 28:44.486
.. with a company called MicroCon.

28:44.572 --> 28:47.564
MicroCon. The computer chip company?

28:47.652 --> 28:51.122
There's a vote coming up
in Congress on that deal.

28:52.452 --> 28:54.443
Put up the 46th floor.

28:59.972 --> 29:02.440
Can the camera get in closer?

29:02.532 --> 29:05.604
- You have to use the gizmo.
- The gizmo? Show me.

29:09.892 --> 29:14.283
You, uh, use the gizmo... to zoom in.

29:14.372 --> 29:18.604
This is all next-generation. There is
nothing like this in this country... yet.

29:18.692 --> 29:20.683
You record by disk?

29:20.772 --> 29:23.127
Record? What do you mean, record?

29:23.212 --> 29:25.123
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:25.212 --> 29:27.601
The disks are all back there.

29:30.852 --> 29:35.323
It's all there on next-generation laser disk.

29:44.092 --> 29:47.129
I'd like to see tonight's disk for the 46th floor.

29:47.212 --> 29:49.203
Uh...

29:50.612 --> 29:54.685
You'd have to talk with my supervisor.
You got a warrant?

29:58.452 --> 30:01.922
These disks record for 12 hours.

30:03.492 --> 30:06.882
Why does the one on the 46th floor
only show two hours?

30:06.972 --> 30:08.963
Excuse me?

30:11.572 --> 30:15.201
The original disk isn't even here,
anyway, is it?

30:15.292 --> 30:17.681
Because it's been replaced.

30:18.452 --> 30:19.521
Uh...

30:19.612 --> 30:21.887
I wouldn't know about that.

30:21.972 --> 30:24.645
That's Mr. Tanaka's department.

30:25.332 --> 30:28.529
Someone at this very moment is watching us.

30:30.812 --> 30:34.885
Under the circumstances,
you've been more than helpful.

30:34.972 --> 30:38.362
I'd like to tell you officers something.

30:38.452 --> 30:40.443
This is a good job.

30:40.532 --> 30:45.048
Around here, if something doesn't work,
I got a problem,...

30:45.132 --> 30:47.521
.. I tell somebody, they fix it!

30:47.972 --> 30:52.409
It's not like when I was working
at GM out there in Van Nuys.

30:52.492 --> 30:55.484
- This is different here.
- You're part of a team.

30:55.572 --> 30:58.450
What, a team? What are they doing for you?

30:58.532 --> 31:01.285
They spotting for you?
Sending you in plays, huh?

31:01.372 --> 31:03.363
Maybe they got instant replay...

31:03.452 --> 31:06.683
Hey, brother, come on!
These people have been good to me.

31:06.772 --> 31:10.401
Kohai, I'm gonna call in a favour.
Stay here with Mr. Phillips.

31:10.492 --> 31:12.289
Come on, kohai.

31:12.372 --> 31:14.647
- Lieutenant Smith.
- Oh.

31:42.692 --> 31:44.967
Don't fuck with these guys.

31:51.012 --> 31:53.685
Hey, the honeys are out tonight.

31:53.772 --> 31:57.162
Oh, here's a nice one. Let's use the gizmo.

31:57.252 --> 31:59.243
Oh, yeah, she's nice.

31:59.492 --> 32:01.483
Not so nice.

32:01.812 --> 32:03.803
She's my ex-wife.

32:05.172 --> 32:07.561
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know.

32:07.652 --> 32:10.086
Don't be. She's a lawyer.

32:12.052 --> 32:14.168
It must be nice to fuck a lawyer...

32:14.252 --> 32:16.846
.. instead of always being fucked by one.

32:18.732 --> 32:21.610
I've seen your friend
around here quite a bit.

32:21.692 --> 32:23.728
- Really?
- Yeah.

32:23.812 --> 32:26.121
Real friendly with Mr. Yoshida there.

32:26.212 --> 32:28.521
And who's Mr. Yoshida?

32:29.372 --> 32:31.602
Mr. Yoshida's the man!

32:31.692 --> 32:33.683
Let's listen in.

32:37.852 --> 32:39.843
I know nothing of this.

32:39.932 --> 32:42.526
Any recordings we have
are yours to examine.

32:42.612 --> 32:44.603
I will look into it immediately.

32:52.052 --> 32:54.043
What does that mean?

32:54.132 --> 32:56.600
Massa wants me to get the car.

33:05.052 --> 33:09.125
Senator Morton, you said
if the sale of MicroCon is approved,...

33:09.212 --> 33:12.443
.. they will control the market
and use the technology...

33:12.532 --> 33:14.727
.. to compete against our own companies.

33:14.812 --> 33:17.884
You know that there is a time and a place
for business,...

33:17.972 --> 33:22.887
.. and tonight I just want to say
that our hosts threw one heck of a gala.

33:22.972 --> 33:26.442
But, Senator, you've said,
"Look what happened to our TV industry. "

33:26.532 --> 33:29.968
- Is there such a thing as off-duty?
- Let's wrap it up.

33:30.052 --> 33:32.441
Hey, you! Quit loafing!

33:32.532 --> 33:34.648
Get the Senator's car! We're waiting.

33:34.732 --> 33:36.962
No! You get the Senator's car.

33:37.052 --> 33:39.691
Wrong guy. Wrong fuckin' century.

33:40.692 --> 33:43.081
Penguin-lookin' motherfucker!

33:44.692 --> 33:46.569
Arigato.

33:46.652 --> 33:48.608
Let me smack this asshole.

33:48.692 --> 33:52.571
Captain Connor!
Remember me? Bob Richmond.

33:52.652 --> 33:54.643
Myers, Lawson and Richmond.

33:54.732 --> 33:58.361
I understand my Nakamoto guys
got a little frazzled tonight.

33:58.452 --> 34:00.841
If I can be of any help to you,...

34:00.932 --> 34:02.923
.. I'm available.

34:03.052 --> 34:05.043
That's comforting.

34:05.572 --> 34:07.563
Asshole!

34:07.652 --> 34:12.328
I knew him when he was a government
trade negotiator dealing with the Japanese.

34:12.411 --> 34:13.844
Now he's working for them.

34:13.931 --> 34:15.922
Like I said,... asshole.

34:40.572 --> 34:41.846
Help you?

34:41.931 --> 34:43.842
Cheryl Lynn Austin.

34:43.931 --> 34:46.571
- She not in.
- Yeah, I know.

34:47.891 --> 34:49.484
Keys.

34:58.932 --> 35:01.207
- Room two.
- Arigato.

35:19.532 --> 35:21.523
The doorman's Yakuza.

35:21.612 --> 35:25.321
I noticed his tattoo. I didn't know
there were so many Yakuza in America.

35:25.412 --> 35:28.563
This isn't America.
This is that shadow world.

35:28.652 --> 35:31.849
They have bars, clubs and... bettaku.

35:33.692 --> 35:38.641
Bettaku. Love residence
where mistresses are kept.

35:38.732 --> 35:41.121
- This is one, huh?
- Correct.

35:41.212 --> 35:43.203
Here we are.

35:51.772 --> 35:53.922
What time did it start raining tonight?

35:54.012 --> 35:56.003
After nine.

35:57.332 --> 35:59.448
Someone was here after nine.

36:00.612 --> 36:02.603
Correct.

37:12.412 --> 37:14.403
Look at this.

37:19.212 --> 37:21.203
She's with Eddie.

37:21.292 --> 37:23.044
You know him?

37:23.132 --> 37:25.248
Mm. Eddie Sakamura.

37:49.732 --> 37:51.529
What's this?

37:56.052 --> 37:59.522
Girlfriend was into some different shit.

38:04.692 --> 38:06.523
Look.

38:06.612 --> 38:11.242
What is with this guy? There's a lot
of pictures of her with your friend Sakamutu.

38:11.332 --> 38:13.323
- Sakamura.
- Whatever.

38:18.372 --> 38:21.569
Somebody's taken photos from here recently.

38:27.972 --> 38:31.362
Oh... I thought I heard Eddie's voice.

38:32.852 --> 38:34.683
Say, um...

38:34.772 --> 38:38.242
- Why is everybody in Cheryl's room tonight?
- Everybody?

38:38.332 --> 38:40.323
Well, you and...

38:40.412 --> 38:43.085
Aren't you just a little bit off limits here?

38:43.172 --> 38:44.685
And who are you?

38:44.772 --> 38:46.763
Me?

38:47.812 --> 38:49.803
Well, I'm Julia.

38:50.452 --> 38:54.001
I'm just a little neighbour girl
who lives down the hall.

38:54.092 --> 38:56.083
Are you Cheryl's back-door man?

38:56.172 --> 38:58.049
And what if I am?

38:59.052 --> 39:01.043
Well...

39:01.132 --> 39:03.248
If you are,...

39:03.332 --> 39:05.323
.. mm, I heard of you.

39:06.292 --> 39:10.205
You better watch out
cos Eddie, he's the real jealous type.

39:10.292 --> 39:13.170
They don't call him Crazy Eddie for nothing.

39:13.252 --> 39:16.164
Really? Well, I'm kinda tough.

39:16.252 --> 39:18.243
Mm, well,...

39:18.492 --> 39:20.562
.. tough as you may be,...

39:22.092 --> 39:25.687
.. Eddie finds out,
then you're gonna be crying.

39:30.092 --> 39:32.083
Um, say,...

39:32.172 --> 39:34.163
.. is Cheryl all right?

39:34.252 --> 39:36.243
No, she isn't.

39:36.612 --> 39:38.603
Lieutenant Web Smith. LAPD.

39:40.252 --> 39:43.289
I knew he was gonna do something to her.

39:43.372 --> 39:46.011
I heard him screaming at Cheryl.

39:46.092 --> 39:50.927
Shouting things like, "I'll kill you",
before he took her to that party tonight.

39:52.652 --> 39:56.201
Many thanks, miss.
Someone from my office will contact you.

39:58.172 --> 40:01.130
I knew he was gonna do something to her.

40:02.452 --> 40:03.851
Kohai.

40:06.092 --> 40:08.083
You know, Web...

40:08.172 --> 40:13.849
Eddie's father is a, um...
big industrialist over there at Daimatsu.

40:17.412 --> 40:20.210
He has a, um... a friend he sees.

40:21.172 --> 40:23.049
Jeanette.

40:23.132 --> 40:25.521
Right up here on the second floor.

40:27.812 --> 40:30.007
You know how Eddie met Cheryl?

40:33.052 --> 40:34.883
Well,...

40:34.972 --> 40:39.363
.. she was working in that Toyota plant
back there in Kentucky.

40:40.252 --> 40:42.243
Then one day,...

40:43.052 --> 40:47.330
.. who should show up
in that small, little town...

40:49.052 --> 40:51.043
.. but Eddie.

40:55.532 --> 40:57.523
Web...

41:22.972 --> 41:26.203
She was about to give up the murderer,
and you just walk away.

41:27.452 --> 41:30.046
Maybe I've been bought off by the Japanese.

41:30.132 --> 41:34.364
Sempai, apple pie, whatever I have
to call you,... we have a murder here.

41:34.452 --> 41:37.125
I want to solve it,
not listen to true confessions.

41:37.212 --> 41:39.203
You know what's true?

41:39.292 --> 41:42.887
When something looks too good
to be true, then it's not true.

41:42.972 --> 41:46.009
Everything she said about Eddie
might have been true.

41:46.092 --> 41:48.560
The real question is
why was she saying it?

41:48.652 --> 41:50.847
OK! Why was she saying it?

41:50.932 --> 41:52.809
I'm not sure.

41:53.932 --> 41:56.730
Because she thought
Eddie killed the girl!

41:56.812 --> 41:59.372
This Julia accidentally walked in...

41:59.452 --> 42:03.047
Nothing is happening accidentally.
She's a messenger.

42:04.372 --> 42:07.444
- Oh, you think someone sent her?
- Mm.

42:07.612 --> 42:09.409
OK. Who?

42:09.492 --> 42:11.403
The bad guys.

42:11.492 --> 42:14.802
And I suppose they sent her in
to find out what we know.

42:14.892 --> 42:17.565
Or to tell us what they wanted us to know.

42:17.652 --> 42:19.643
Or maybe to slow us down.

42:20.452 --> 42:22.602
She certainly slowed you down.

42:22.692 --> 42:23.966
Bullshit!

42:24.052 --> 42:27.089
Bullshit?
Never underestimate your opponent.

42:27.172 --> 42:29.640
Never take what he offers you.

42:30.052 --> 42:32.202
You want to solve this crime?

42:32.292 --> 42:34.248
- Yes.
- Well, so do I.

42:34.332 --> 42:35.481
Now let's move.

42:39.812 --> 42:41.803
Come on, Eddie!

42:50.972 --> 42:54.647
Darling, those days are gone from your life.

42:57.012 --> 43:00.402
I could dance like that. I'm an old
song-and-dance man from way back.

43:00.492 --> 43:03.404
Oh, yeah? Wanna teach me some steps?

43:15.372 --> 43:19.729
- It's by invitation only, gentlemen.
- Mr. Sakamura.

43:19.812 --> 43:23.088
- Mr. Sakamura is not here.
- That's him. The bad tap-dancer.

43:24.612 --> 43:27.172
Mr. Sakamura is not available.

43:27.252 --> 43:31.370
Mr. Sakamura is a good friend of mine.
I'm sure he's available for me.

43:32.052 --> 43:35.203
Gentlemen, you're trespassing.

43:35.292 --> 43:39.888
Now, unless you have a search warrant,
you'll have to leave.

43:40.812 --> 43:43.485
You should know I'm a black belt.

43:43.572 --> 43:46.132
- But of course you are, dear.
- Need help, Perry?

43:46.212 --> 43:47.884
So is Jeff.

43:51.652 --> 43:54.041
OK, fellas. You're leaving.

43:56.852 --> 43:58.843
That's assault.

43:59.732 --> 44:01.723
I don't wanna hurt you.

44:08.292 --> 44:12.922
They say if you must resort
to violence, you've already lost.

44:13.012 --> 44:14.843
What do you think, Jeff?

44:14.932 --> 44:17.685
I think I'll go get Mr. Sakamura.

44:21.652 --> 44:24.212
- Ah, Captain Connor!
- Eddie.

44:26.132 --> 44:30.284
My father will be happy to hear
you're still up to your same old tricks.

44:30.372 --> 44:32.363
We're here to talk, Eddie.

44:33.012 --> 44:35.048
So talk. It's a free country.

44:35.132 --> 44:38.329
It's about the murder at Nakamoto tonight.

44:38.412 --> 44:40.607
Well, let's talk outside.

44:47.012 --> 44:49.446
Yeah. I heard about that. Some poor girl.

44:49.532 --> 44:51.329
You know her, Eddie.

44:52.292 --> 44:54.283
Cheryl Austin.

44:54.372 --> 44:57.011
Oh, yeah, Cheryl. Mm. That girl.

44:57.892 --> 44:59.883
Too bad.

45:00.972 --> 45:03.440
I hear she was a real hentai onna.

45:03.532 --> 45:05.409
You knew her better than that.

45:05.492 --> 45:08.245
You're putting her up at the Imperial Arms.

45:08.332 --> 45:11.642
Oh, that Cheryl.
Oh, I know her real well.

45:11.732 --> 45:14.963
- She was all over me, Connor-san.
- You're irresistible.

45:15.052 --> 45:17.043
That's true, but, uh...

45:17.132 --> 45:19.441
Connor-san, she had a big problem.

45:19.532 --> 45:23.081
She was a sick girl. She liked pain.

45:23.172 --> 45:27.290
Put a plastic bag over her head,
always saying, "Squeeze harder. "

45:27.372 --> 45:30.364
Squeeze the neck? You like that, do you?

45:30.452 --> 45:32.443
Me? No!

45:32.532 --> 45:35.251
I'm a straight meat-and-potatoes man.

45:35.332 --> 45:37.607
Don't let 'em see you like this. Get up!

45:37.692 --> 45:40.968
- Did you see her tonight?
- Tonight? Me?

45:41.052 --> 45:44.522
Maybe for two minutes at the party.
Just to say hello.

45:44.612 --> 45:47.604
Mr. Sakamura,
I think you'd better come with us.

45:51.012 --> 45:53.128
Yeah, I saw her tonight.

45:55.692 --> 45:57.808
I brought her to the party.

45:57.892 --> 46:00.360
But I have nothing to do with it.

46:00.452 --> 46:04.240
Look, I can prove it to you.
Just let me call you later.

46:04.332 --> 46:06.800
I will bring you something.

46:06.892 --> 46:09.884
- I think that's a bad idea.
- Captain.

46:09.972 --> 46:12.122
Nakamoto is keiretsu.

46:12.212 --> 46:15.329
My father is Daimatsu keiretsu.

46:15.412 --> 46:20.406
If his son is arrested here,
there will be repercussions.

46:20.492 --> 46:23.768
Business is war. I know you understand.

46:35.372 --> 46:37.363
Do you have your passport?

46:37.452 --> 46:39.443
Yeah, sure.

46:42.492 --> 46:44.483
Give him your card.

46:44.572 --> 46:46.563
And you call him, Eddie.

46:48.892 --> 46:50.291
Connor-san!

47:01.412 --> 47:04.324
- I sure hope you know what you're doing.
- Me, too.

47:04.412 --> 47:06.403
He's guilty as hell.

47:06.492 --> 47:09.052
Well, my dairokkan says he's not.

47:09.132 --> 47:11.726
I hope your intuition is right.

47:23.052 --> 47:24.963
Look, sempai,...

47:25.052 --> 47:29.045
.. my dairokkan tells me your dairokkan
wasn't why you let Eddie go.

47:30.252 --> 47:33.244
In Japan, his father saved my life.

47:34.252 --> 47:36.243
And Eddie reminded you of that?

47:36.332 --> 47:38.402
He would never remind me.

47:38.492 --> 47:41.086
It's my responsibility to remember.

47:41.172 --> 47:44.403
So what is all this bullshit
about his father's keiretsu?

47:44.492 --> 47:47.131
Bullshit? There's a keiretsu war going on.

47:47.212 --> 47:50.409
A Japanese corporation never stands alone.

47:50.492 --> 47:55.612
A keiretsu is a united front
of hundreds of powerful companies,...

47:55.692 --> 47:58.206
.. all acting in partnership to win.

47:58.292 --> 47:59.566
To win what?

47:59.652 --> 48:01.643
Whatever's there.

48:01.732 --> 48:04.405
You ever hear "business is war"?

48:05.532 --> 48:07.523
The war is never over.

48:07.612 --> 48:10.729
Maybe you heard
"All's fair in love and war"?

48:10.812 --> 48:12.370
No.

48:12.452 --> 48:14.841
- So where does that leave us?
- Us?

48:16.412 --> 48:18.403
We're in the war zone.

48:35.052 --> 48:39.364
So, based on the lab results,
the guy who fucked her was Japanese.

48:39.452 --> 48:41.443
Semen analysis is blood type AB.

48:41.532 --> 48:45.491
Diego factor positive.
Negative for ethanol dehydrogenase.

48:45.572 --> 48:48.882
Asian pattern.
Male pubic hair also Asian in origin.

48:48.972 --> 48:52.089
Evidence points to a Japanese perpetrator.

48:52.172 --> 48:54.242
It's a Jap perp all right.

49:00.132 --> 49:02.327
Sumimasen... Sumimasen.

49:04.972 --> 49:06.963
What the hell's this?

49:10.652 --> 49:12.643
Looks like your guy confessed.

49:12.732 --> 49:15.041
No. It's just Sumimasen.

49:15.132 --> 49:20.001
If they're caught doing something wrong, to
get leniency, they must perform an apology.

49:20.092 --> 49:22.481
- You mean it's an act?
- Not exactly.

49:22.572 --> 49:25.370
He's genuinely scared
you'll create a scandal.

49:25.452 --> 49:30.207
Yoshida-san insisted that he find
the missing disk and deliver it to us.

49:30.292 --> 49:31.964
Yeah, good luck.

49:32.052 --> 49:35.249
That disk is probably
in a Tokyo landfill by now.

49:41.412 --> 49:43.403
What the hell's this?

49:43.492 --> 49:45.483
Daytime. 46th floor.

49:45.572 --> 49:48.644
Negotiations for MicroCon.
Semiconductors.

49:48.732 --> 49:50.723
Hey, can we skip the cartoons?

49:50.812 --> 49:52.803
Hold on. We're just starting.

49:57.332 --> 49:59.323
Richmond-san. Busy, busy.

49:59.412 --> 50:01.767
Hey, let's go. Get to it!

50:01.852 --> 50:04.241
Ah. Night-time. Same place.

50:05.172 --> 50:07.163
Looks different then.

50:08.852 --> 50:10.843
Jesus! It's her.

50:17.932 --> 50:21.004
Hello.

50:21.852 --> 50:23.843
Come on in.

50:39.572 --> 50:41.563
He looks Japanese.

50:42.372 --> 50:44.363
Maybe he's Polish.

50:47.852 --> 50:50.525
He's checking to see
if she's carrying a gun.

50:50.612 --> 50:52.682
Someone's using the gizmo.

50:52.772 --> 50:55.332
Gizmo. He's sure using it on her.

51:06.652 --> 51:09.120
There go the hands to the neck.

51:09.212 --> 51:11.203
Just the way she likes it.

51:32.532 --> 51:35.000
Hey, Mr. Nice Guy. Turn around.

51:38.692 --> 51:41.843
Oh, no! Don't tell me
he's gonna walk out in the dark.

51:42.252 --> 51:44.561
No! Step into...

51:44.652 --> 51:47.769
There! Back it up!

51:52.132 --> 51:53.724
There.

51:53.812 --> 51:56.087
That's right, I knew it all along.

51:56.172 --> 51:58.322
- I was right about this.
- Eddie.

51:58.412 --> 52:00.368
You know this fucker?

52:00.452 --> 52:02.010
Eddie Sakamura.

52:02.092 --> 52:03.844
We had him tonight.

52:03.932 --> 52:07.766
- What do you mean, you had him?
- We had him. We let him go.

52:08.732 --> 52:12.805
- I kept his passport.
- His fuckin' passport? Jesus!

52:12.892 --> 52:15.247
Get his ass, not his passport!

52:15.332 --> 52:20.087
What are you waiting for? You want banzai
carved on her ass with a samurai sword?

52:20.172 --> 52:23.050
Let's go get this Eddie Sock-It-To-Me.

52:23.132 --> 52:27.444
I'm gonna break your arms, my friend.
I'm gonna love breaking them.

52:28.932 --> 52:30.923
Come on, Web!

53:02.012 --> 53:04.082
The old guy sucker punched me.

53:04.972 --> 53:07.247
If I see him again, he's dead meat.

53:07.332 --> 53:09.562
Oh, forget it.

53:18.652 --> 53:21.724
Good evening, Jeff. Mr. Sakamura in?

53:27.652 --> 53:29.643
Easy, big fella.

53:37.812 --> 53:39.882
Just like old times, Web.

53:39.972 --> 53:42.805
Do you miss it? A night out with the boys?

53:43.452 --> 53:47.206
- Sure beats all that diplomacy shit.
- I thought no violence.

53:48.172 --> 53:50.163
Last thing we want.

53:50.252 --> 53:52.641
The guy's a murderer, Spider-san.

53:52.732 --> 53:54.723
LAPD takes no chances.

53:54.812 --> 53:57.326
Yeah, but we do take prisoners. Right?

54:00.372 --> 54:02.522
Why did Connor let this guy walk?

54:02.612 --> 54:04.603
I can't say.

54:05.252 --> 54:07.243
What is he about?

54:08.052 --> 54:10.612
He's always careful not to offend their...

54:10.692 --> 54:13.081
What is it we're not supposed to offend?

54:13.172 --> 54:15.163
Fuck 'em, they break the law.

54:15.252 --> 54:17.641
If that brands me as a reactionary...

54:17.732 --> 54:21.008
- We're in position. Stand by.
- Moving in.

54:22.252 --> 54:24.641
Is reactionary a dirty word?

54:24.732 --> 54:26.723
Like racist, or something like that?

54:26.812 --> 54:30.851
All this talk of race.
Whatever happened to good and evil?

54:30.932 --> 54:32.923
A guy did it, you catch him.

55:22.492 --> 55:25.802
Plundering our natural resources.

55:25.892 --> 55:28.326
Fuckin' guys are into everything!

55:37.332 --> 55:39.323
What time you got, Web?

55:40.452 --> 55:42.443
2.10.

55:42.852 --> 55:47.323
Make a note.
At 2.11, suspect was apprehended.

55:47.412 --> 55:51.166
Eddie Sakamura calling. It's urgent.
I must speak about missing disk.

55:56.412 --> 55:58.403
Police! Get down!

56:00.372 --> 56:02.090
Stay where you are! Get down!

56:02.172 --> 56:03.844
Don't move! Get down!

56:03.932 --> 56:05.923
- You guys, out the back!
- You son of a bitch!

56:06.012 --> 56:08.003
What the hell? Get off of me!

56:08.812 --> 56:10.325
There he goes!

56:10.412 --> 56:12.323
Oh, shit!

56:12.412 --> 56:14.528
What the hell is wrong with you? Get off!

56:15.492 --> 56:17.687
You're nuts! Get off of me!

56:18.012 --> 56:20.003
Get that son of a bitch!

56:22.892 --> 56:26.248
- I'm a police officer!
- You're a piece of shit!

57:03.852 --> 57:05.843
8- Adam-65.

57:05.932 --> 57:08.002
Am in pursuit of 187 suspect,
eastbound, Sunset.

57:10.172 --> 57:14.563
All units, stand by.
8- Adam-65 in pursuit eastbound...

57:17.052 --> 57:19.930
8- Adam-65, what is your location?

57:25.372 --> 57:27.567
Stay back, I want him alive.

57:28.452 --> 57:30.443
Holy shit!

57:38.092 --> 57:40.083
Damn! Damn, damn, damn!

57:42.132 --> 57:44.726
Coroner's officials have taken possession...

57:44.812 --> 57:48.282
.. of the charred remains
identified as Mr. Edward Sakamura.

57:48.372 --> 57:50.203
The crash took place after...

57:50.292 --> 57:52.487
We tried to take him, but he ran, Chief.

57:52.572 --> 57:56.247
Burnt beyond recognition. The guy's a cinder.

57:56.332 --> 57:59.005
You got proof that Sakamura
committed the murder?

57:59.092 --> 58:03.165
- Absolutely. Got it all recorded. Right?
- Absolutely.

58:04.092 --> 58:06.083
You did everything by the book?

58:06.172 --> 58:08.322
By the book. Absolutely, Chief.

58:09.252 --> 58:11.243
Absolutely.

58:11.332 --> 58:14.529
But everything was not
absolutely by the book.

58:16.012 --> 58:18.003
Absolutely not.

58:18.092 --> 58:20.890
And when did you discover this?

58:35.166 --> 58:36.201
Yeah.

58:36.286 --> 58:38.197
- Lieutenant Smith?
- Yeah.

58:38.286 --> 58:40.880
This is division dispatcher.
Uncleared messages.

58:40.966 --> 58:44.402
- All right, go ahead.
- 5.27am, Captain Connor.

58:44.486 --> 58:46.442
Oh, Connor.

58:46.526 --> 58:49.882
He said to give you a wake-up call at seven...

58:49.966 --> 58:52.639
.. and to meet him at the golf club at 9.15am.

58:52.726 --> 58:54.796
All right, all right. Anything else?

58:54.886 --> 58:56.877
Let's see... Nope.

58:56.966 --> 58:58.604
What about last night?

58:58.686 --> 59:01.280
You got all your messages last night.

59:01.366 --> 59:03.357
No, I didn't call in last night.

59:03.446 --> 59:05.437
Yeah, you did.

59:05.726 --> 59:07.717
Let's see, uh... yep.

59:09.086 --> 59:13.238
2.33. Your clearance number was given
and messages were transmitted.

59:13.326 --> 59:15.999
Um... Look, I forgot.

59:16.646 --> 59:19.080
Can you give those messages to me again?

59:19.166 --> 59:21.202
All right, just a sec.

59:21.286 --> 59:23.481
What were you doing last night?!

59:23.566 --> 59:25.284
Uh...

59:25.366 --> 59:28.005
- Sort of helping my career.
- Is that good?

59:28.086 --> 59:30.042
Yeah. It's always good.

59:30.126 --> 59:32.515
Cos you gotta look out
for yourself in life.

59:32.606 --> 59:35.404
Grandma says you gotta look out
for other people.

59:35.486 --> 59:38.284
Yeah. Well, you gotta do that, too.

59:38.366 --> 59:41.039
That's why everybody's so busy all the time.

59:41.126 --> 59:44.243
So, is that what business is?

59:44.326 --> 59:45.679
Business?

59:45.766 --> 59:48.644
No, business... Business is uh...

59:52.446 --> 59:54.437
Business is... is...

59:55.126 --> 59:57.356
I can't explain it to you right now.

59:57.446 --> 01:00:00.244
Is that why Mommy says
you've no head for business?

01:00:00.326 --> 01:00:02.396
- Lieutenant Smith? Here we go.
- Yeah.

01:00:02.486 --> 01:00:05.922
Daddy? Why does Mommy call you a loser?

01:00:06.006 --> 01:00:07.997
Out!

01:00:08.086 --> 01:00:12.523
Ken Shubik, please call. Message reads,
"The Weasel's checking up on you. "

01:00:12.606 --> 01:00:14.403
- The Weasel?
- Yeah.

01:00:14.486 --> 01:00:17.364
Then 2.10 this morning,
Mr. Eddie Sakamura...

01:00:18.006 --> 01:00:20.395
- Eddie Sakamura?
- Correct.

01:00:20.486 --> 01:00:24.161
2.10am. Message reads,
"Urgent. Must speak about missing disk. "

01:00:39.846 --> 01:00:41.837
Nice shot!

01:00:53.886 --> 01:00:56.480
Hey! I gotta talk to you!

01:00:58.286 --> 01:00:59.605
We gotta have a conversation.

01:00:59.686 --> 01:01:01.677
Ooh! Shit! Whoa, whoa!

01:01:05.606 --> 01:01:08.723
Yoshida-san. I'm embarrassed
by this crude interruption.

01:01:08.806 --> 01:01:10.797
You must play your stroke again.

01:01:10.886 --> 01:01:12.877
No penalty.

01:01:17.606 --> 01:01:19.801
- Ken Shubik.
- Hey, Ken! Web Smith.

01:01:19.886 --> 01:01:22.605
- Did you get my message?
- Yeah, about the Weasel.

01:01:22.686 --> 01:01:25.439
Last night, I'm working late at the paper...

01:01:25.526 --> 01:01:27.915
I see the Weasel arrive, dressed in his tux.

01:01:28.006 --> 01:01:29.997
He goes right to the library.

01:01:30.086 --> 01:01:33.123
I could tell the ambitious turd
had the scent of blood.

01:01:33.206 --> 01:01:34.525
He's still here.

01:01:34.606 --> 01:01:37.837
I ask the librarian what he's checking out.

01:01:37.926 --> 01:01:40.804
She says, "A cop named Web Smith. "

01:01:40.886 --> 01:01:45.004
- What?
- Yep. The guy's a scumbag for hire.

01:01:45.086 --> 01:01:48.442
He used to do jobs
for the studios and realtors.

01:01:48.526 --> 01:01:52.519
The little turd just got
a new Mercedes 500SL.

01:01:52.606 --> 01:01:55.723
Pretty good on a reporter's salary.

01:01:55.806 --> 01:01:58.479
Wonder who he's working for now?

01:01:58.566 --> 01:02:01.603
You get on the wrong side
of somebody last night?

01:02:01.686 --> 01:02:04.439
- Maybe.
- Somebody's got the Weasel tracking you.

01:02:04.526 --> 01:02:07.040
Something about
a charge brought against you.

01:02:07.126 --> 01:02:11.244
- A charge brought against me?
- You and a Lieutenant Tom Graham.

01:02:11.326 --> 01:02:13.681
At the hearing I was cleared. It was bullshit!

01:02:13.766 --> 01:02:16.200
Maybe so,
but I thought you'd better know.

01:02:16.286 --> 01:02:19.244
Smells like something heavy coming down.

01:02:22.126 --> 01:02:26.199
What happened to the disk? We left it
with you when we went to get Eddie.

01:02:26.286 --> 01:02:29.517
And you got Eddie.
Oh, yes. It was all over the paper.

01:02:29.606 --> 01:02:33.997
There was no mention of the murdered girl
on the boardroom table, right?

01:02:34.086 --> 01:02:37.237
You had the disk.
It is against the rules to take evidence.

01:02:37.326 --> 01:02:39.157
The rules?

01:02:39.246 --> 01:02:40.804
Whose rules?

01:02:40.886 --> 01:02:42.683
The rules!

01:02:42.766 --> 01:02:44.757
The chief says we fucked up...

01:02:44.846 --> 01:02:48.680
The Japanese have a saying.
"Fix the problem, not the blame. "

01:02:48.766 --> 01:02:51.041
Find out what's fucked up and fix it.

01:02:51.126 --> 01:02:55.278
Nobody gets blamed.
We're always after who fucked up.

01:02:55.366 --> 01:02:57.243
Their way's better.

01:02:57.326 --> 01:02:58.236
Oh!

01:02:58.326 --> 01:03:01.045
Their way is better?
You wake me up to tell me that?

01:03:01.126 --> 01:03:03.720
Wake you up? That'll be the day.

01:03:09.166 --> 01:03:12.158
Keep it, sport.
Next time, try a parking meter.

01:03:13.086 --> 01:03:15.122
- Captain Connor?
- Yes.

01:03:15.206 --> 01:03:17.197
A gift from Mr. Hanada.

01:03:17.286 --> 01:03:19.561
Oh! Thank you. I appreciate it.

01:03:19.646 --> 01:03:21.796
Most welcome. Most welcome.

01:03:26.686 --> 01:03:29.678
You must have really
took those guys this morning.

01:03:29.766 --> 01:03:31.757
No. I lost.

01:03:31.846 --> 01:03:34.519
Lost? Guys didn't look all that good.

01:03:34.606 --> 01:03:36.597
Oh, they're not.

01:03:36.686 --> 01:03:39.883
It's difficult to lose
without making it too obvious.

01:03:39.966 --> 01:03:42.878
- That way they don't lose face.
- Saving face.

01:03:42.966 --> 01:03:45.321
Sounds more to me
like you were kissing ass.

01:03:45.406 --> 01:03:48.842
Not exactly.
I've done services for those men in the past.

01:03:48.926 --> 01:03:51.315
And we've shared information.

01:03:51.406 --> 01:03:55.160
They said that Eddie's death
will have repercussions.

01:03:55.246 --> 01:03:56.599
Yeah, right!

01:03:56.686 --> 01:04:00.474
I'm sorry. The guy was a fugitive.
He killed the girl.

01:04:00.566 --> 01:04:02.841
- I doubt it.
- You doubt it?

01:04:02.926 --> 01:04:04.996
Well, I saw it on the disk.

01:04:05.086 --> 01:04:07.077
Did you?

01:04:15.446 --> 01:04:17.835
It's the only space available to us.

01:04:17.926 --> 01:04:22.317
We analyse commercials and network news
to see how the public's being tricked.

01:04:22.406 --> 01:04:26.638
Problem is, most students want to learn
the tricks so they can use them to get ahead.

01:04:26.726 --> 01:04:28.717
OK, everybody!

01:04:28.806 --> 01:04:30.717
Class is over.

01:04:30.806 --> 01:04:34.196
Ice-skating rink upstairs.
The ice melts down here.

01:04:34.286 --> 01:04:38.564
Speaking of ice, Captain, she's been at it
since you gave her the disk at 3am.

01:04:38.646 --> 01:04:42.400
Jingo Asakuma,...
meet Lieutenant Web Smith.

01:04:43.326 --> 01:04:45.396
You're late.

01:04:45.486 --> 01:04:47.681
What have we got?

01:04:48.966 --> 01:04:50.763
Something there.

01:04:52.206 --> 01:04:54.197
In the edge colours.

01:04:54.806 --> 01:04:58.958
Look at shadow lines.
They added some shadows.

01:04:59.046 --> 01:05:01.037
Look at the light source.

01:05:02.566 --> 01:05:05.126
We can see her face, but we can't see his.

01:05:05.206 --> 01:05:08.004
- Perfect job, though.
- And what else?

01:05:08.086 --> 01:05:09.883
The reflection.

01:05:09.966 --> 01:05:12.526
- Of Eddie.
- It's fishy.

01:05:13.086 --> 01:05:15.759
Wait a minute. What's going on here?

01:05:15.846 --> 01:05:17.837
Oh. Here we are.

01:05:19.846 --> 01:05:23.202
Let's look at the colour shift in the pixels.

01:05:23.286 --> 01:05:25.959
Yeah. Let's look at those pixels.

01:05:29.086 --> 01:05:31.316
Pixels have been doctored.

01:05:31.406 --> 01:05:33.397
See the blue edge?

01:05:33.486 --> 01:05:36.558
- This disk's a copy.
- A copy? Wait a minute.

01:05:36.646 --> 01:05:41.003
You're saying somebody put Eddie's face
there and it's not his reflection?

01:05:41.086 --> 01:05:43.077
Come on, that's bullshit!

01:05:43.166 --> 01:05:48.001
Bullshit? Where have you been, Lieutenant?
You don't think video can be altered?

01:05:48.086 --> 01:05:51.317
I want you to watch what I've been recording
on that camera.

01:06:08.246 --> 01:06:13.525
This is quick and crude, but imagine
the effect with more sophisticated equipment.

01:06:13.606 --> 01:06:15.403
Watch this.

01:06:15.486 --> 01:06:20.241
You're saying somebody put Eddie's face
there and it's not his reflection?

01:06:20.326 --> 01:06:22.317
Come on, that's bullshit!

01:06:23.366 --> 01:06:24.958
Hum!

01:06:25.046 --> 01:06:28.755
- They'd need photos of this man.
- They have photos of Eddie.

01:06:28.846 --> 01:06:31.565
From the dead girl's apartment.
Off the mirror.

01:06:31.646 --> 01:06:35.798
- Do you believe in ghosts, Lieutenant Smith?
- What do you mean, do I believe in ghosts?

01:06:35.886 --> 01:06:38.923
In Japan, when I was growing up,
we believed in many ghosts.

01:06:39.006 --> 01:06:41.042
I want you to watch this.

01:06:41.126 --> 01:06:43.435
Tell me what you see.

01:06:46.606 --> 01:06:48.085
See it?

01:06:48.166 --> 01:06:49.758
- See what?
- Yeah.

01:06:49.846 --> 01:06:51.962
Play it again,... but slowly.

01:06:52.046 --> 01:06:55.038
The way to see it is to move slightly faster.

01:07:01.366 --> 01:07:03.243
It's a ghost!

01:07:03.326 --> 01:07:06.363
- Look at that! It's a ghost!
- A third person.

01:07:06.446 --> 01:07:09.802
- It's been systematically erased.
- Erased?

01:07:09.886 --> 01:07:13.481
Just like airbrushing someone out of a still,
only much harder.

01:07:14.846 --> 01:07:16.837
It pisses me off, though.

01:07:16.926 --> 01:07:19.998
They expect us to be sloppy Americans.

01:07:20.086 --> 01:07:23.396
They think we will not be thorough,
not be intelligent.

01:07:23.486 --> 01:07:25.681
In Japan, I guess they'd have done it right.

01:07:26.366 --> 01:07:28.926
Right. The ghost would have stayed hidden.

01:07:29.006 --> 01:07:31.918
To do this, they would need
high-res video stills,...

01:07:32.006 --> 01:07:34.474
.. close-ups of the table, anything in the area.

01:07:34.566 --> 01:07:37.080
They'd have to duplicate
the ghost's walk.

01:07:37.166 --> 01:07:40.795
Like someone walking through the room,
shooting photographs?

01:07:40.886 --> 01:07:42.877
- The security guy.
- Tanaka.

01:07:42.966 --> 01:07:46.117
He was walking backwards
through the room taking pictures.

01:07:46.206 --> 01:07:48.401
Wait. Here's something.

01:07:48.486 --> 01:07:50.556
Look, there in the glass.

01:07:52.046 --> 01:07:55.038
Our ghost has left a reflection.

01:07:56.846 --> 01:08:00.634
I'm adjusting image resolution
and sharpening.

01:08:00.726 --> 01:08:05.675
If I apply an edge detection operation,
I should be able to isolate the reflection...

01:08:05.766 --> 01:08:07.757
.. and pull out its shape.

01:08:12.406 --> 01:08:16.843
Let's... adjust resolution and...

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:19.917
.. magnitude of each of the colour channels.

01:08:35.446 --> 01:08:39.439
Let's filter out all the noise
we picked up along the way.

01:08:48.845 --> 01:08:50.837
Holy shit.

01:08:51.446 --> 01:08:53.437
Eddie Sakamura.

01:08:53.526 --> 01:08:55.720
Then he witnessed the murder.

01:08:55.805 --> 01:08:58.764
How many hours
did they have to work on these?

01:08:58.845 --> 01:09:01.997
- I got my call at...
- The murder took place 8.30pm.

01:09:02.086 --> 01:09:05.522
- Ishihara delivered the disk to us... 1.33am.
- Five hours.

01:09:05.606 --> 01:09:07.676
I doubt it could be done.

01:09:07.765 --> 01:09:09.801
If it could be done,...

01:09:09.886 --> 01:09:11.956
.. where would it be done?

01:09:23.645 --> 01:09:26.160
- It's quiet.
- Hardly anyone's in yet.

01:09:26.246 --> 01:09:29.397
They were working late
last night on a rush project.

01:09:29.486 --> 01:09:31.953
I'm sure Nakamoto
appreciates the hard work.

01:09:32.046 --> 01:09:34.844
Yes. I heard it went real well for them.

01:09:35.805 --> 01:09:38.319
Mr. Donaldson is expecting you.

01:09:38.406 --> 01:09:42.843
Yes. We did some work together
when this was the Donaldson Corporation.

01:09:45.086 --> 01:09:47.475
- Jim, how are you?
- Captain Connor.

01:09:47.685 --> 01:09:49.596
- Web Smith.
- Hello.

01:09:49.685 --> 01:09:53.076
- What can I do for you?
- Well, we need your help, Jim.

01:09:53.166 --> 01:09:54.963
Anything.

01:09:55.046 --> 01:09:58.800
You worked on some disks last night
for Nakamoto.

01:09:58.886 --> 01:10:00.922
Some disks? Oh, I doubt that.

01:10:01.006 --> 01:10:03.600
You did. And I need their names.

01:10:04.326 --> 01:10:06.237
Our clients are confidential.

01:10:06.326 --> 01:10:08.999
I know, but err... we do need your help.

01:10:09.086 --> 01:10:11.998
Captain, we wouldn't have done
any work for Nakamoto here.

01:10:12.086 --> 01:10:16.841
You know damn well Nakamoto
and Hamaguri are competing keiretsu.

01:10:16.926 --> 01:10:20.396
Yes, but I've been told
by reliable sources...

01:10:20.486 --> 01:10:25.685
.. that only you have the next generation
of technology to do this kind of work.

01:10:25.846 --> 01:10:27.837
Your reliable sources are wrong.

01:10:27.926 --> 01:10:31.396
Besides, we're way beyond
the next generation here.

01:10:31.486 --> 01:10:33.716
And I really don't know anything.

01:10:33.806 --> 01:10:37.321
- You still run this place, don't you?
- Run it? Sure.

01:10:37.406 --> 01:10:40.682
I'm still the chief executive here... sort of.

01:10:40.966 --> 01:10:43.878
Actually, my role is a little different now.

01:10:43.966 --> 01:10:45.922
You mean you don't run it?

01:10:46.006 --> 01:10:49.362
Look, we sold it. They own it.

01:10:49.446 --> 01:10:52.756
People who own things are entitled
to do whatever they want with them.

01:10:52.846 --> 01:10:54.837
That's the way it works.

01:10:54.926 --> 01:10:58.282
But, hey, you know...
There's a bright side to everything.

01:10:58.366 --> 01:11:01.039
I'm getting out
to a lot more Dodger games lately.

01:11:01.126 --> 01:11:03.481
Having some fun. You know what I'm saying.

01:11:03.566 --> 01:11:05.557
Yes, I do, Jim.

01:11:05.646 --> 01:11:07.477
Fine.

01:11:07.566 --> 01:11:09.875
Best regards to Mrs Donaldson.

01:11:09.966 --> 01:11:12.321
How's uh... what-s-her-name?

01:11:12.406 --> 01:11:14.317
She's fine.

01:11:14.406 --> 01:11:16.636
- Give her my best!
- I will.

01:11:20.046 --> 01:11:23.834
- So... what do we know now?
- Well, we know the disk was doctored here.

01:11:23.926 --> 01:11:27.157
And we know that they know that we know.

01:11:27.246 --> 01:11:29.919
We're beating the grass to startle the snakes.

01:11:30.486 --> 01:11:34.081
What? Look, where are you from, sempai?

01:11:34.166 --> 01:11:37.556
- Scotland Yard?
- No. Scotland back yard.

01:11:38.086 --> 01:11:41.635
So how did you become
the special liaison officer for Los Angeles?

01:11:41.726 --> 01:11:43.717
And uh... who is what-s-her-name?

01:11:43.806 --> 01:11:48.402
What you should be asking is
why you and I were put together last night.

01:11:48.486 --> 01:11:51.637
- I was on duty. Nakamoto requested you.
- No, they didn't.

01:11:51.726 --> 01:11:55.321
Nakamoto is formally protesting
the fact that I'm on the case.

01:11:55.886 --> 01:11:58.241
You're saying someone else called you in.

01:11:58.326 --> 01:12:01.079
- Someone who...
- Has been manipulating things.

01:12:01.166 --> 01:12:04.636
We're playing that most American of games.

01:12:04.726 --> 01:12:05.920
Which is what?

01:12:06.006 --> 01:12:07.837
Catch up.

01:12:26.166 --> 01:12:30.557
My golfer friends also said
that Eddie's people might retaliate.

01:12:31.886 --> 01:12:34.605
Eddie's people might retaliate? Against who?

01:12:34.686 --> 01:12:37.484
Whoever they feel
was responsible for his death.

01:12:37.566 --> 01:12:39.716
What do mean when you say retaliate?

01:12:39.806 --> 01:12:43.355
- I shouldn't say any more.
- But you've been talking all morning!

01:12:43.446 --> 01:12:46.244
I just realised
they may have bugged your car.

01:12:46.326 --> 01:12:47.520
They? Who's they?

01:12:51.286 --> 01:12:53.083
Let's move!

01:13:05.806 --> 01:13:09.685
- We're the cops! Why are we running?
- We're not running. We're eluding.

01:13:10.566 --> 01:13:12.363
Eluding.

01:13:38.046 --> 01:13:40.037
We're safe around here.

01:13:40.126 --> 01:13:42.117
You call this safe?

01:13:42.206 --> 01:13:45.323
Rough neighbourhoods
may be America's last advantage.

01:13:47.086 --> 01:13:49.475
Perhaps I may suggest a strategy.

01:13:50.046 --> 01:13:52.844
Don't stare at these guys.
Keep your hands down.

01:13:52.926 --> 01:13:55.156
These guys don't like big arm movements.

01:13:55.246 --> 01:13:56.964
They might shoot you.

01:13:57.046 --> 01:13:59.958
Keep your voice calm...
Better still, don't say shit.

01:14:00.046 --> 01:14:02.799
If you hear me say
"Can I be of any assistance?"...

01:14:02.886 --> 01:14:06.003
.. it's too late.
You can kiss your little ass goodbye.

01:14:08.406 --> 01:14:10.044
Hey, Yo! What's up?

01:14:10.886 --> 01:14:14.083
Spider? Spider Web Smith
scored 40 against Crenshaw.

01:14:14.166 --> 01:14:15.155
48.

01:14:15.246 --> 01:14:17.919
- Yo, motherfucker. What year was that?
- '75.

01:14:18.006 --> 01:14:21.123
- Was that before Columbus or after?
- Very funny.

01:14:25.486 --> 01:14:27.875
- Armani?
- Yeah.

01:14:27.966 --> 01:14:29.558
Giorgio!

01:14:29.646 --> 01:14:31.637
You be doin' just fine, brother!

01:14:31.726 --> 01:14:34.798
Look, I'm escorting this old geezer
back to the loony farm.

01:14:34.886 --> 01:14:36.956
He stole sushi from some Japanese cats.

01:14:37.046 --> 01:14:40.834
Now they chasin' us.
So I need you guys to get behind us.

01:14:40.926 --> 01:14:42.917
Think you can help us out?

01:14:44.366 --> 01:14:46.357
We got your back.

01:15:08.006 --> 01:15:10.201
Hey! You guys lookin' for something?

01:15:21.486 --> 01:15:24.205
- Do your window, sir?
- Yeah, OK.

01:15:25.686 --> 01:15:27.563
You got your pink slip?

01:15:27.646 --> 01:15:29.637
Why pink slip?

01:15:29.726 --> 01:15:33.036
Because I was led to believe
this car would be for sale...

01:15:33.126 --> 01:15:34.479
.. soon.

01:15:43.526 --> 01:15:46.757
- Senator Morton's campaign office.
- Senator Morton, please.

01:15:46.846 --> 01:15:49.644
- Who's calling?
- Captain Connor returning his call.

01:15:49.726 --> 01:15:51.159
And there he goes.

01:15:58.406 --> 01:16:00.681
What's wrong with this picture?

01:16:03.766 --> 01:16:06.485
- The clock isn't moving.
- Exactly.

01:16:06.566 --> 01:16:09.319
After the guy leaves, time stands still.

01:16:09.406 --> 01:16:12.204
What they probably did here
was rock and roll.

01:16:12.286 --> 01:16:16.677
Print the same scene over and over
to keep the pixels - the grain - alive.

01:16:16.766 --> 01:16:20.998
They removed what came after this guy's exit
and that made the disks the standard length.

01:16:21.086 --> 01:16:24.635
So no-one would suspect
anything was missing after that. But...

01:16:24.726 --> 01:16:26.717
Something happened after that.

01:16:26.806 --> 01:16:30.799
If we only had the original disk,
we could see what happened after that.

01:16:30.886 --> 01:16:32.285
Exactly.

01:16:32.366 --> 01:16:34.675
You catch on fast, Lieutenant Smith.

01:16:35.366 --> 01:16:37.357
Web.

01:16:37.646 --> 01:16:39.443
Yeah, I do.

01:16:41.366 --> 01:16:43.960
I should go and make
a copy of the disk for you.

01:16:53.206 --> 01:16:54.798
Miss Asakuma...

01:16:54.886 --> 01:16:56.877
- Jingo.
- Jingo.

01:16:56.966 --> 01:16:59.321
How do you feel about working with us?

01:16:59.406 --> 01:17:01.397
I mean the police.

01:17:01.486 --> 01:17:04.922
- Especially since you're...
- You mean... because I'm Japanese.

01:17:06.446 --> 01:17:08.038
Yeah.

01:17:09.646 --> 01:17:11.637
Here I'm Japanese.

01:17:12.806 --> 01:17:15.001
But in Japan, I was ainoku.

01:17:17.926 --> 01:17:19.917
My father was a kokujin.

01:17:20.006 --> 01:17:21.678
You know that word, kokujin?

01:17:21.766 --> 01:17:23.757
- Negro?
- Negro.

01:17:23.846 --> 01:17:25.916
Oh, yes. I know that word.

01:17:26.006 --> 01:17:28.076
Yes, a Black man.

01:17:31.126 --> 01:17:34.004
He was with the American Air Force.

01:17:34.406 --> 01:17:37.204
My mother worked in a noodle shop.

01:17:38.126 --> 01:17:40.117
Do you know the term...

01:17:40.726 --> 01:17:42.762
.. "he's a bit burakumin"?

01:17:42.846 --> 01:17:44.837
It's like uh...

01:17:45.406 --> 01:17:47.317
Untouchable.

01:17:47.406 --> 01:17:49.874
I was even lower than burakumin...

01:17:50.566 --> 01:17:52.557
.. because I was deformed.

01:17:52.646 --> 01:17:56.036
To the Japanese, deformity is shameful.

01:17:56.126 --> 01:17:58.845
It means you've done something wrong.

01:18:00.406 --> 01:18:02.397
And then on top of all that...

01:18:02.486 --> 01:18:04.477
.. I really did something wrong.

01:18:04.566 --> 01:18:06.557
And what was that?

01:18:08.166 --> 01:18:10.236
I fell in love with a gaijin.

01:18:10.326 --> 01:18:12.715
A Caucasian who was living there.

01:18:12.806 --> 01:18:14.876
We were both ostracised.

01:18:16.526 --> 01:18:20.439
Made his work over there difficult
and my life impossible.

01:18:20.526 --> 01:18:22.482
He had to leave Japan.

01:18:22.566 --> 01:18:24.363
He left you?

01:18:24.446 --> 01:18:27.244
- Maybe we left each other.
- No.

01:18:27.326 --> 01:18:28.918
He ran out.

01:18:29.006 --> 01:18:30.724
He couldn't take it.

01:18:30.806 --> 01:18:32.797
Him?

01:18:33.246 --> 01:18:35.521
No, he could take anything.

01:18:36.086 --> 01:18:38.680
My friend is a very strange man.

01:18:39.326 --> 01:18:41.317
You know what he says?

01:18:41.686 --> 01:18:44.564
Always leave the cage door open...

01:18:45.086 --> 01:18:47.281
.. so the bird can return.

01:18:48.646 --> 01:18:51.080
Your friend sounds like an idiot.

01:18:51.166 --> 01:18:53.157
Let's go, kohai. We're late.

01:18:54.806 --> 01:18:57.001
And bring the disk.

01:19:03.766 --> 01:19:05.757
Thank you.

01:19:13.326 --> 01:19:15.237
Your pal took the disk.

01:19:15.326 --> 01:19:18.636
- Anyway, we got the right guy.
- Maybe we got the wrong guy.

01:19:18.726 --> 01:19:21.479
What are you talking about?
The case is closed.

01:19:21.566 --> 01:19:24.524
Just relax. Go home, get some sleep.
Slow down.

01:19:24.606 --> 01:19:26.597
Fuck you, slow down.

01:19:27.446 --> 01:19:29.437
- They're squeezing me.
- Who?

01:19:29.526 --> 01:19:31.994
- Who?
- Yeah, who's squeezing you?

01:19:33.886 --> 01:19:35.285
Come on, now. Wake up.

01:19:35.366 --> 01:19:37.960
These aren't the old days.
Just get me that disk...

01:19:38.046 --> 01:19:41.004
.. and the case is closed,
just how everybody wants it to be.

01:19:43.086 --> 01:19:45.919
There's your disk.
Go make everybody happy.

01:19:46.006 --> 01:19:47.997
You close the case.

01:19:48.086 --> 01:19:50.077
What are you gonna do?

01:19:50.166 --> 01:19:52.157
I'm opening it up.

01:19:52.886 --> 01:19:54.399
What?

01:19:54.486 --> 01:19:57.683
Oh, what am I?
Endangering my chances for advancement?

01:20:00.566 --> 01:20:02.557
Baby, if you only knew.

01:20:20.366 --> 01:20:24.325
Five Japanese nationals inspecting
the remains of last night's car wreck.

01:20:24.406 --> 01:20:27.842
The guys from Nakamoto.
What are they looking for?

01:20:27.926 --> 01:20:29.917
An interesting question.

01:20:30.006 --> 01:20:31.997
Do you recognise the pick-up truck?

01:20:32.446 --> 01:20:34.243
Yeah.

01:20:34.326 --> 01:20:36.920
It was outside Eddie's last night,
by the Cadillac.

01:20:37.006 --> 01:20:39.361
It looked suspicious,
so we had it brought in.

01:20:41.646 --> 01:20:44.080
There's the ownership of the Toyota.

01:20:45.126 --> 01:20:47.117
Tanaka?

01:20:47.206 --> 01:20:48.605
Yeah.

01:20:50.366 --> 01:20:52.482
Head of Nakamoto security.

01:20:52.566 --> 01:20:56.002
Now, what was Tanaka doing
at Eddie's last night?

01:21:00.286 --> 01:21:01.685
Hey, Lieutenant Smith!

01:21:01.766 --> 01:21:03.996
Willy Wilhelm, LA Times. How's it going?

01:21:04.086 --> 01:21:06.077
- Pretty busy right now.
- I understand.

01:21:06.166 --> 01:21:09.158
We're preparing a story on you
about the Martino case.

01:21:09.246 --> 01:21:13.285
The accusation of accepting a bribe
brought against you by Mr. Martino?

01:21:13.366 --> 01:21:15.163
- Any comment?
- No comment.

01:21:15.246 --> 01:21:18.477
Lieutenant Graham made some
interesting comments. Wanna hear them?

01:21:18.566 --> 01:21:21.285
- No.
- The DA's office is about to reopen the case.

01:21:21.366 --> 01:21:22.719
- No comment?
- No!

01:21:22.806 --> 01:21:26.594
Captain Connor, what about the charge
of Japan-bashing in tonight's paper?

01:21:26.686 --> 01:21:27.914
Hey!

01:21:28.046 --> 01:21:30.037
Hey? Hay is for horses.

01:21:30.126 --> 01:21:33.198
What is Japan-bashing? What does it mean?

01:21:33.286 --> 01:21:36.278
All animals are created equal
except the Japanese?

01:21:36.366 --> 01:21:38.721
You stupid little shit! Fuck off!

01:21:39.126 --> 01:21:41.117
Can I quote you on that, sir?

01:21:42.326 --> 01:21:44.157
Japan-bashing? You?

01:21:44.246 --> 01:21:47.477
- What'll they think of next?
- Next?

01:21:47.566 --> 01:21:49.636
Next they'll call you a racist.

01:21:54.006 --> 01:21:55.997
Look. I've told you.

01:21:56.406 --> 01:21:59.079
I have no idea where Mr. Tanaka is.

01:21:59.166 --> 01:22:01.157
I haven't seen him.

01:22:01.246 --> 01:22:03.885
- But did he come in today?
- I don't know.

01:22:04.166 --> 01:22:07.841
And even if I did know,
the answer is "I don't know. "

01:22:07.926 --> 01:22:09.757
Well, someone knows.

01:22:09.846 --> 01:22:13.555
You guys'll never beat 'em.
They're too good.

01:22:17.686 --> 01:22:22.521
I've told you this in order
to avoid unnecessary embarrassment.

01:22:22.606 --> 01:22:25.678
I am surprised to hear this, Connor-san.

01:22:25.766 --> 01:22:29.679
Because, personally,
I welcome your involvement.

01:22:29.766 --> 01:22:31.757
I know that you're always...

01:22:34.686 --> 01:22:37.154
- Discreet.
- Ah, yes.

01:22:38.126 --> 01:22:40.117
You ask me about MicroCon.

01:22:40.206 --> 01:22:43.960
We were approached in Tokyo last year
by Richmond-san.

01:22:44.046 --> 01:22:47.163
And I'll tell you,
MicroCon needed a shot in the arm.

01:22:47.246 --> 01:22:51.159
So I thought that Nakamoto
would be just what the doctor ordered.

01:22:55.206 --> 01:22:57.197
Excuse me.

01:22:57.966 --> 01:22:59.957
Go on, sir.

01:23:02.486 --> 01:23:05.558
Frankly, we were surprised
it would be offered.

01:23:05.646 --> 01:23:09.434
We were cautious
to enter into negotiations.

01:23:09.526 --> 01:23:15.158
We received assurances that there would be
no objection to the sale from Washington.

01:23:15.246 --> 01:23:21.685
We have been criticised for trying
to help a company in financial difficulty.

01:23:22.206 --> 01:23:24.197
We feel very...

01:23:24.286 --> 01:23:26.516
.. kitsu-tsuita.

01:23:26.606 --> 01:23:29.074
- Wounded. Yes.
- Yes.

01:23:50.006 --> 01:23:52.201
- That's bullshit, but...
- Life goes on.

01:23:52.286 --> 01:23:54.436
I remember when computers were fun.

01:23:54.806 --> 01:23:55.795
Hey, guys!

01:23:57.406 --> 01:24:00.079
See you back up there.
Let's get this deal closed.

01:24:00.166 --> 01:24:02.157
So, anyway...

01:24:02.926 --> 01:24:05.918
- Not much team spirit.
- They'll get into it.

01:24:06.006 --> 01:24:09.965
Especially now since they know
Senator Morton is changing his vote.

01:24:11.806 --> 01:24:14.001
He's been convinced his stand is racist.

01:24:14.086 --> 01:24:16.725
- Racist?
- What else could it be?

01:24:16.806 --> 01:24:20.481
Remember when Fujitsu tried
to buy Fairchild Semiconductor?

01:24:20.566 --> 01:24:24.684
The US government blocked the sale
saying it was against national security...

01:24:24.766 --> 01:24:26.518
.. to sell it to a foreign company.

01:24:26.606 --> 01:24:29.279
Then later Fairchild is sold
to a French company.

01:24:29.366 --> 01:24:33.120
This time there's not a peep from
Congress, Senator Morton, or anyone.

01:24:33.206 --> 01:24:35.879
Apparently, it was OK
to sell to a foreign company.

01:24:35.966 --> 01:24:37.877
Just not a Japanese company.

01:24:37.966 --> 01:24:40.321
I'd say that's racist policy,
pure and simple.

01:24:40.406 --> 01:24:41.600
Captain Connor.

01:24:41.686 --> 01:24:44.678
Nakamoto is an honourable company.

01:24:44.886 --> 01:24:49.960
We have no part in any...
complications that have occurred.

01:24:50.326 --> 01:24:54.365
But if they don't want Japan to buy it,
don't sell it.

01:24:55.326 --> 01:24:59.319
- I will assist you in whatever way I can.
- I'm very grateful.

01:24:59.406 --> 01:25:01.601
Tomorrow at noon for golf?

01:25:02.246 --> 01:25:04.077
Tomorrow at noon.

01:25:05.366 --> 01:25:09.154
I will try to make it harder
for you to let me win.

01:25:18.766 --> 01:25:22.042
Senator. Are you comfortable
with this new position?

01:25:22.126 --> 01:25:26.517
Absolutely.
Because I don't view it as a new position.

01:25:26.606 --> 01:25:28.597
I view it as a modification...

01:25:28.966 --> 01:25:31.355
That's exactly what it is. A modification.

01:25:31.446 --> 01:25:34.916
The response has been ten to one
in favour of the way I've...

01:25:35.006 --> 01:25:36.724
.. modified my position.

01:25:36.806 --> 01:25:38.797
Modified? It's a total reversal.

01:25:38.886 --> 01:25:40.877
Oh, no. Not at all.

01:25:41.806 --> 01:25:45.355
It's simply a...
refinement of my earlier views.

01:25:45.446 --> 01:25:48.040
Foreign trade invigorates America.

01:25:48.126 --> 01:25:50.879
I've always been a proponent of fair trade...

01:25:50.966 --> 01:25:54.561
But you were against the sale
because it put our advanced weaponry...

01:25:54.646 --> 01:25:56.602
.. in the control of the Japanese.

01:25:56.686 --> 01:25:59.280
Now, that's... really vastly simplified.

01:26:00.806 --> 01:26:03.001
Ah! More affirmations.

01:26:03.686 --> 01:26:07.201
Oh, Senator Shanley.
It must have killed him to write this!

01:26:07.286 --> 01:26:09.322
All the polls have been positive.

01:26:09.406 --> 01:26:13.285
Ah! But I didn't bring you here
to discuss politics and economics.

01:26:13.366 --> 01:26:16.244
I know how that must bore men like you.

01:26:16.846 --> 01:26:18.837
I just wanted your input, gentlemen.

01:26:18.926 --> 01:26:22.999
I know you're investigating events
that took place at the Nakamoto party.

01:26:24.086 --> 01:26:28.682
I wondered if you felt there was any linkage
between those unfortunate events...

01:26:28.766 --> 01:26:30.961
.. and the proposed sale of MicroCon.

01:26:32.046 --> 01:26:34.037
We're not aware of any linkage.

01:26:35.166 --> 01:26:40.081
Has Nakamoto done anything unfair
or improper in promoting this sale?

01:26:40.166 --> 01:26:42.043
Not that we're aware of, no.

01:26:42.126 --> 01:26:44.037
Good.

01:26:44.126 --> 01:26:46.356
Your investigation is concluded, then?

01:26:47.566 --> 01:26:49.124
Yes.

01:26:49.846 --> 01:26:51.598
Good!

01:26:51.686 --> 01:26:54.075
That's it, then, gentlemen. Thank you.

01:26:55.526 --> 01:26:57.517
There's one for you.

01:26:57.606 --> 01:26:59.403
Thank you.

01:26:59.486 --> 01:27:03.035
And one for you. Thank you very much.

01:27:03.126 --> 01:27:07.039
- John, here's some more faxes.
- Ah, more support! Always welcome.

01:27:09.006 --> 01:27:10.644
Mind if I give you some advice?

01:27:12.566 --> 01:27:14.318
No.

01:27:14.406 --> 01:27:16.397
If a battle can't be won,...

01:27:16.486 --> 01:27:18.397
.. don't fight it.

01:27:22.246 --> 01:27:24.840
If a battle can't be won, don't fight it?

01:27:24.926 --> 01:27:28.760
Mm. The Art Of War. Sun Su, China.
Fifth century BC.

01:27:28.846 --> 01:27:31.679
- An educated guy, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

01:27:31.766 --> 01:27:33.916
He read a fortune cookie once.

01:27:35.646 --> 01:27:37.841
Keep this number between us.

01:27:42.006 --> 01:27:44.804
Lieutenant Smith?
I have Lauren Smith for you.

01:27:44.886 --> 01:27:47.161
Ah, just what I needed.

01:27:47.246 --> 01:27:50.044
Webster, I'm calling to inform you
I'm taking Zelda.

01:27:50.126 --> 01:27:53.562
- When? This weekend?
- Today at 5 o'clock.

01:27:53.646 --> 01:27:55.443
What are you talking about?

01:27:55.526 --> 01:27:59.439
I'm talking about charges being brought
against you concerning bribery.

01:28:00.526 --> 01:28:03.563
Come on, Lauren.
You know everything about that charge.

01:28:03.646 --> 01:28:05.637
It was thrown out. Remember?

01:28:05.726 --> 01:28:08.843
- Come off it! We both know what happened.
- Stop it, Lauren.

01:28:08.926 --> 01:28:11.724
- Plus the fact that you've become a racist.
- A what?

01:28:11.806 --> 01:28:13.797
And you associate with known racists.

01:28:13.886 --> 01:28:18.323
The courts will find that you're providing
an improper atmosphere for our daughter.

01:28:18.406 --> 01:28:21.125
- They want you to back off.
- You're not taking Zelly.

01:28:21.206 --> 01:28:25.484
Are you denying me my right? I'm with
my attorney. We're recording this call.

01:28:25.566 --> 01:28:29.320
Record this. Fuck you! And fuck
your lawyer too, if you already haven't!

01:28:29.406 --> 01:28:31.362
You're not coming near Zelly...

01:28:31.446 --> 01:28:33.835
That's enough.

01:28:37.366 --> 01:28:40.961
What the fuck are you doing?
You wanna take me on? Step out of this car!

01:28:41.046 --> 01:28:44.038
I've had enough of you!
You wanna take me on?

01:28:46.286 --> 01:28:48.083
Get out! Come on!

01:28:48.166 --> 01:28:50.726
I'm tired of your shit! I'm tired of her shit!

01:28:50.806 --> 01:28:54.162
Come on! I'll pimp-slap you
up and down this fuckin' street!

01:28:54.246 --> 01:28:56.555
Tell me about the bribery charge, kohai.

01:28:56.646 --> 01:28:59.080
- The what?
- The bribery charge.

01:28:59.166 --> 01:29:03.318
Look. The woman who filed the charge
was a chronic psychiatric case.

01:29:03.406 --> 01:29:06.079
The review board dismissed it.
You got that?

01:29:06.166 --> 01:29:08.964
All right. Now I gotta go get Zelly.

01:29:09.046 --> 01:29:11.560
I can't help you if you won't tell me.

01:29:11.646 --> 01:29:14.114
Tell you what?! It was dismissed.

01:29:14.206 --> 01:29:16.515
You know cops are always being accused...

01:29:16.606 --> 01:29:20.042
.. of assault, molestation, taking bribes.
All kinds of shit!

01:29:20.646 --> 01:29:22.637
Jesus Christ!

01:29:24.286 --> 01:29:26.322
I'm a good cop!

01:29:43.166 --> 01:29:45.316
It was a domestic violence call.

01:29:45.406 --> 01:29:47.920
The kid is in the crib screaming his head off.

01:29:48.006 --> 01:29:51.794
I pull back the covers
and next to the kid is a kilo of white brick.

01:29:51.886 --> 01:29:53.922
Graham says we can't make the arrest,...

01:29:54.006 --> 01:29:57.794
.. that the search is invalid,
the wife can't testify against her husband,...

01:29:57.886 --> 01:30:00.275
.. and that any decent lawyer will beat this.

01:30:00.366 --> 01:30:03.403
The woman is screaming,
the kid is screaming.

01:30:04.006 --> 01:30:05.997
I'm losing my mind here.

01:30:08.566 --> 01:30:13.481
Suddenly the husband walks in
with an envelope this thick...

01:30:13.566 --> 01:30:15.238
.. with $100 bills.

01:30:15.326 --> 01:30:18.955
He says to me,
"Thank you, officer, for all your help. "

01:30:19.726 --> 01:30:21.717
"Thank you very much. "

01:30:21.806 --> 01:30:24.843
Graham turns to me and gives me the nod.

01:30:25.246 --> 01:30:27.043
And you took the money.

01:30:27.126 --> 01:30:29.196
What was I supposed to do, man?

01:30:29.286 --> 01:30:32.722
I mean, my wife...
My wife was pregnant.

01:30:32.806 --> 01:30:36.082
Health insurance didn't cover it.
We had bills up to here.

01:30:36.166 --> 01:30:38.396
Yes! Yes! I took the money.

01:30:38.486 --> 01:30:40.477
Me and Graham split it.

01:30:42.886 --> 01:30:45.480
Now you're the only one that knows about it.

01:30:46.566 --> 01:30:48.557
Graham knows and now,...

01:30:48.646 --> 01:30:49.999
.. who else?

01:30:50.086 --> 01:30:52.316
Yeah. Graham knows.

01:30:52.886 --> 01:30:54.877
Wanna know why I told you?

01:30:54.966 --> 01:30:58.038
- Why?
- I figure you're on the take, too.

01:30:58.486 --> 01:31:02.525
- What are you talking about?
- That fuckin' fat envelope in your pocket.

01:31:02.606 --> 01:31:05.643
The one the guy gave you
back at the golf club.

01:31:05.726 --> 01:31:07.796
This is a golf membership.

01:31:07.886 --> 01:31:10.923
Oh! So how much
is a membership worth these days?

01:31:12.766 --> 01:31:14.279
A hundred thousand.

01:31:14.726 --> 01:31:16.717
A hundred thousand.

01:31:16.806 --> 01:31:20.355
Boy, they sure make it easy
to take a 100,000 bucks, don't they?

01:31:21.966 --> 01:31:23.957
Golf is how they do business.

01:31:24.046 --> 01:31:26.321
This is very important for what I do.

01:31:26.406 --> 01:31:30.524
Well, I guess that makes everything
all white now, doesn't it?

01:31:47.606 --> 01:31:49.836
Make sure she hasn't taken Zelly.

01:31:49.926 --> 01:31:52.360
Damn! If it's not one thing, it's another.

01:31:52.446 --> 01:31:54.437
Zelly!

01:31:54.766 --> 01:31:57.405
Zelly! Hey, babe, you here?

01:32:00.966 --> 01:32:02.957
Somebody's here.

01:32:03.046 --> 01:32:05.276
I was wondering where he would show up.

01:32:06.686 --> 01:32:08.085
Oh, my God!

01:32:11.726 --> 01:32:13.318
Put that phone down!

01:32:13.406 --> 01:32:16.842
- I'm just calling my guys.
- Put the phone down.

01:32:21.526 --> 01:32:24.086
- So who was killed in the car crash?
- Tanaka.

01:32:24.166 --> 01:32:25.997
- The security guy.
- Yes,...

01:32:26.086 --> 01:32:27.678
.. Tanaka.

01:32:27.766 --> 01:32:31.395
He worked for Nakamoto,
but he had a special relationship with me.

01:32:31.486 --> 01:32:35.195
My father's keiretsu could offer
a better future to him, understand?

01:32:35.286 --> 01:32:38.164
Tanaka... He liked women.

01:32:38.246 --> 01:32:42.717
And drugs too. And for that,
give me good information.

01:32:42.806 --> 01:32:47.243
- He tried to set you up as the murderer.
- Well, he was playing both sides.

01:32:47.326 --> 01:32:49.476
Look, I'm still alive. He's still dead.

01:32:49.566 --> 01:32:52.638
He double-crossed me,
but I double-crossed him better.

01:32:52.726 --> 01:32:56.514
He's afraid to get caught with me
so he uses my car... and kill himself.

01:32:58.086 --> 01:33:00.475
Ah, I didn't like the colour anyway.

01:33:02.486 --> 01:33:04.556
You reported the murder.

01:33:05.246 --> 01:33:07.316
Then you called me in, hum?

01:33:07.406 --> 01:33:11.524
My father always said,
if you need help, call Connor-san.

01:33:11.606 --> 01:33:15.281
Those Japanese guys,
what were they looking for in the car?

01:33:15.366 --> 01:33:19.075
What Tanaka brought Eddie...
and what Eddie was going to give to us.

01:33:20.086 --> 01:33:22.077
That's right, Connor-san.

01:33:23.646 --> 01:33:26.080
- The original disk.
- Connor-san,...

01:33:26.166 --> 01:33:28.157
.. you smart cookie for a gaijin.

01:33:28.246 --> 01:33:30.714
But you're gonna be surprised
when you see this.

01:33:31.246 --> 01:33:35.398
Uh-uh. First, give me back my passport.

01:33:35.486 --> 01:33:37.522
I think I'm gonna need it.

01:33:42.486 --> 01:33:44.477
Careful, kohai.

01:33:44.566 --> 01:33:47.080
- Who is it?
- Me, Web. Let me in.

01:33:47.166 --> 01:33:49.157
It's Graham.

01:33:49.246 --> 01:33:51.237
Hide a sword with a smile.

01:33:54.686 --> 01:33:57.996
Hey, Tom! How you doing?
What are you doing here? What's wrong?

01:33:58.086 --> 01:34:00.395
- Wrong?
- Yeah.

01:34:02.926 --> 01:34:04.917
What the fuck's wrong with you?

01:34:05.006 --> 01:34:06.997
What are you talking about?

01:34:09.686 --> 01:34:12.246
The squeeze is on, baby.

01:34:12.326 --> 01:34:14.203
Your ex is talking.

01:34:14.286 --> 01:34:17.119
The chief is shitting
and the Weasel's snooping.

01:34:17.206 --> 01:34:20.118
- Opening up new things.
- New things?

01:34:20.206 --> 01:34:22.197
What new things?

01:34:22.286 --> 01:34:24.277
Look, are you on the take?

01:34:24.366 --> 01:34:27.517
- Fuck you, the take.
- Are you on the fuckin' take?!

01:34:27.606 --> 01:34:30.803
Who the fuck are you to ask me about that?

01:34:30.886 --> 01:34:33.480
You started me off. You remember that?

01:34:34.166 --> 01:34:36.157
Now, play ball.

01:34:36.246 --> 01:34:39.875
You get to keep your kid, your job,
and your buddies. We're a team, Web.

01:34:39.966 --> 01:34:42.685
A team? What team are we on, huh?

01:34:44.806 --> 01:34:46.797
We know who you've got in there.

01:34:46.886 --> 01:34:49.081
You're harbouring a murderer in there.

01:34:49.166 --> 01:34:51.555
How did you know Eddie was still alive?

01:34:51.646 --> 01:34:54.956
He's not! He's dead.

01:34:55.046 --> 01:34:57.082
He just forgot to lay down.

01:34:57.166 --> 01:34:58.884
- He didn't do it.
- Who did it?

01:34:58.966 --> 01:35:00.957
We don't know who did it!

01:35:01.846 --> 01:35:04.838
Send him out, Spider-san, with the disk too.

01:35:06.326 --> 01:35:08.317
I'll protect the guy.

01:35:08.406 --> 01:35:10.397
And what if I don't?

01:35:10.486 --> 01:35:12.397
If you don't?!

01:35:12.486 --> 01:35:15.319
If you don't, you're obstructing justice.

01:35:15.406 --> 01:35:17.397
You're harbouring, baby.

01:35:17.486 --> 01:35:20.364
If you don't, we're coming in after a murderer.

01:35:23.526 --> 01:35:25.517
What are you doing to your life?

01:35:27.886 --> 01:35:30.275
You know me, Web. I get my man.

01:35:30.366 --> 01:35:33.563
Yeah. Even if he's the wrong man.

01:35:33.966 --> 01:35:37.402
Who the fuck are you? The Supreme Court?

01:35:38.046 --> 01:35:42.915
You're putting a lot of guys
in the line of fire to protect one dead Nip.

01:35:49.206 --> 01:35:53.518
You risk your life and your child for me.

01:35:55.446 --> 01:35:57.721
Kariga dekimashita.

01:36:10.366 --> 01:36:12.357
We're like sitting ducks up here.

01:36:14.646 --> 01:36:16.637
Time to be among them.

01:36:25.046 --> 01:36:27.037
Don't let anyone in.

01:36:28.486 --> 01:36:30.477
Put this on.

01:36:31.326 --> 01:36:33.317
And don't try to go out.

01:36:38.566 --> 01:36:40.363
Arigato.

01:36:50.846 --> 01:36:52.598
Daddy!

01:36:52.686 --> 01:36:53.801
Zelly.

01:36:55.166 --> 01:36:57.475
Baby, not right now, OK?

01:36:57.566 --> 01:37:00.160
You and Grandma want to stay in the room.
Go!

01:37:07.686 --> 01:37:10.678
Don't do anything.
We'll take care of everything.

01:37:30.246 --> 01:37:32.157
They want us to wait.

01:37:32.246 --> 01:37:36.125
This Eddie guy's alive.
They want a shot at him.

01:37:39.486 --> 01:37:41.477
I gotta figure this.

01:37:43.286 --> 01:37:45.675
The first rule is to protect your ass.

01:37:45.766 --> 01:37:49.156
Maybe we ought to get some backup.
What do you say?

01:38:09.046 --> 01:38:10.479
Hello.

01:38:22.086 --> 01:38:23.644
Hai.

01:39:00.486 --> 01:39:02.556
Kohai, it's me.

01:39:05.806 --> 01:39:08.798
Come on, let's go.
I've cleared the back staircase. Go!

01:39:08.886 --> 01:39:10.524
Come, come, come.

01:39:10.606 --> 01:39:12.597
I'll stay with Eddie.

01:39:15.086 --> 01:39:16.883
Daddy!

01:39:16.966 --> 01:39:18.558
Zelly.

01:39:41.326 --> 01:39:42.839
Eddie!

01:39:58.646 --> 01:40:00.125
Eddie!

01:40:14.286 --> 01:40:16.402
Eddie!

01:40:16.486 --> 01:40:18.442
Eddie!

01:40:22.966 --> 01:40:24.843
Eddie!

01:40:29.646 --> 01:40:30.795
Hey!

01:40:42.806 --> 01:40:44.762
Web!

01:40:45.246 --> 01:40:46.838
Web.

01:40:48.246 --> 01:40:50.237
Kohai.

01:40:54.286 --> 01:40:56.163
And that's all I remember.

01:40:57.926 --> 01:41:00.724
Luckily, you were wearing the proper gear.

01:41:00.806 --> 01:41:02.922
Yeah. Luckily.

01:41:06.246 --> 01:41:08.316
You've read this morning's paper.

01:41:08.406 --> 01:41:11.159
You were caught
in the middle of gang warfare.

01:41:11.246 --> 01:41:15.524
Man, I was caught
in the middle of a business negotiation.

01:41:15.606 --> 01:41:17.562
No, Lieutenant.

01:41:17.646 --> 01:41:19.557
You can read.

01:41:19.646 --> 01:41:24.037
You were the target
of a drive-by shooting by a street gang.

01:41:24.126 --> 01:41:26.117
It was a grudge attack.

01:41:26.206 --> 01:41:28.800
None of the suspects has been apprehended.

01:41:28.886 --> 01:41:32.879
One gang member was found murdered
by ritual strangulation.

01:41:32.966 --> 01:41:35.275
So Eddie's dead now.

01:41:35.366 --> 01:41:37.277
Officially.

01:41:37.366 --> 01:41:40.676
Officially, the case is closed.

01:41:41.366 --> 01:41:43.516
Under the circumstances,...

01:41:43.606 --> 01:41:48.282
.. we're recommending that you take
a voluntary leave of absence.

01:41:50.566 --> 01:41:52.522
And, Lieutenant,...

01:41:52.606 --> 01:41:56.599
.. would you be able to tell us
the whereabouts of Captain Connor?

01:41:59.726 --> 01:42:01.557
No.

01:42:01.646 --> 01:42:03.716
I have no idea where he is.

01:42:07.646 --> 01:42:09.637
They shut us down.

01:42:09.726 --> 01:42:12.718
Put a padlock on the front door,
just like that.

01:42:12.806 --> 01:42:14.558
Know how it works?

01:42:14.646 --> 01:42:18.685
A phone call to the university president
from major endowers.

01:42:19.566 --> 01:42:21.955
The fuckers can't stop us that easily.

01:42:23.926 --> 01:42:27.077
- They're still ahead of us, kohai.
- Got here as fast as I could.

01:42:27.166 --> 01:42:28.724
They're looking for you.

01:42:28.806 --> 01:42:31.274
We've been piecing it together.

01:42:31.366 --> 01:42:34.358
Earlier in the evening,
Eddie and Cheryl made love.

01:42:34.446 --> 01:42:37.961
But at the party she met another man,
her secret lover.

01:42:38.046 --> 01:42:39.877
Her back-door man.

01:42:39.966 --> 01:42:43.083
Someone at Nakamoto
must have suggested...

01:42:43.166 --> 01:42:46.875
.. that they use the executive bedroom
on the 46th floor.

01:42:46.966 --> 01:42:50.322
But they never got
beyond the boardroom table.

01:42:50.406 --> 01:42:52.840
Here comes your ghost.

01:42:58.926 --> 01:43:01.486
Eddie. Before they erased him.

01:43:02.566 --> 01:43:05.638
- He's letting her get killed.
- He's seen this before.

01:43:05.726 --> 01:43:07.921
The gasper routine.

01:43:09.446 --> 01:43:11.914
Funny old world, eh?

01:43:12.006 --> 01:43:14.281
I thought Eddie was the jealous lover.

01:43:14.366 --> 01:43:16.834
A stronger passion overtook him.

01:43:16.926 --> 01:43:19.121
His loyalty to his father's keiretsu.

01:43:19.206 --> 01:43:21.766
They also wanted to purchase MicroCon.

01:43:21.846 --> 01:43:25.236
Don't forget there's a keiretsu war going on.

01:43:27.286 --> 01:43:29.277
Who is it?

01:43:29.886 --> 01:43:31.877
Who is it?

01:43:32.406 --> 01:43:33.885
Senator Morton.

01:43:33.966 --> 01:43:38.164
Eddie probably offered her
to the Senator as form of hospitality.

01:43:38.246 --> 01:43:40.316
So, Senator Morton killed her?

01:43:40.406 --> 01:43:42.476
Wait till you see the rest of the disk.

01:43:42.566 --> 01:43:45.922
We know they used this situation
to blackmail Senator Morton.

01:43:46.006 --> 01:43:48.839
They pinned the murder on Eddie
by doctoring the disk.

01:43:48.926 --> 01:43:52.999
- Why was Eddie protecting him?
- The Senator was voting in his favour.

01:43:53.086 --> 01:43:55.759
This is about who would control MicroCon.

01:43:55.846 --> 01:43:59.885
Whoever controlled the Senator
would control the fate of MicroCon.

01:43:59.966 --> 01:44:02.844
This is the part of the disk
we never saw before.

01:44:02.926 --> 01:44:04.917
There. You see that?

01:44:05.366 --> 01:44:07.163
Yeah, the clock. It's moving.

01:44:07.246 --> 01:44:09.521
No. The girl.

01:44:09.606 --> 01:44:11.597
She's moving.

01:44:12.366 --> 01:44:14.357
Holy shit.

01:44:14.446 --> 01:44:15.879
She's alive.

01:44:15.966 --> 01:44:18.958
She was alive, until...

01:44:21.486 --> 01:44:23.477
Now, who the hell is this?

01:44:23.566 --> 01:44:26.205
Someone who's been observing...

01:44:26.286 --> 01:44:30.723
.. and knows the exact location
of the hidden cameras.

01:45:18.926 --> 01:45:20.644
Please go on.

01:45:20.726 --> 01:45:23.001
What? That's it?

01:45:23.086 --> 01:45:25.236
That's all we got?!

01:45:25.326 --> 01:45:29.114
- We can't let 'em get away with this shit.
- Get away with this?

01:45:29.646 --> 01:45:32.114
They won't get away with this.

01:45:32.526 --> 01:45:35.324
I am very, very okotta!

01:45:35.406 --> 01:45:38.079
- Pissed off.
- Yes! Pissed off.

01:45:38.726 --> 01:45:41.524
Good. So what do we do now?

01:45:41.606 --> 01:45:44.040
Yes. What do we do now?

01:45:44.126 --> 01:45:47.243
- You're asking me?
- Yes.

01:45:47.326 --> 01:45:50.636
We beat the grass to startle the snakes.

01:45:50.726 --> 01:45:52.717
Exactly.

01:46:03.486 --> 01:46:05.477
Oh, my God.

01:46:46.486 --> 01:46:48.158
Hai. Moshi-moshi.

01:46:48.246 --> 01:46:50.202
We had an agreement.

01:46:50.286 --> 01:46:52.402
You said nothing would happen.

01:46:52.486 --> 01:46:54.875
- We had a deal!
- Yes, sir.

01:46:54.966 --> 01:46:56.957
Did you see what I just got by fax?!

01:46:57.046 --> 01:47:00.482
I understand. Thank you.
Very kind of you to call.

01:47:00.566 --> 01:47:02.557
.. the fucking technology would protect me!

01:47:16.406 --> 01:47:18.397
Oh, my God. Look at this.

01:47:18.486 --> 01:47:22.161
We will decide
whether the MicroCon sale goes through.

01:47:22.246 --> 01:47:26.239
I will be basing my vote
on my country's needs.

01:47:27.486 --> 01:47:31.764
You have aspirations
perhaps for the highest office in the land.

01:48:08.686 --> 01:48:10.358
Excuse me just a second.

01:48:10.446 --> 01:48:12.835
Hey uh... Can I help you with something?

01:48:12.926 --> 01:48:16.316
- Hey! What's going on? You can't barge in...
- You, shut up.

01:48:16.406 --> 01:48:18.362
Yoshida-san.

01:48:18.446 --> 01:48:20.243
Forgive this interruption.

01:48:20.326 --> 01:48:22.476
But there is something I must show you.

01:48:22.566 --> 01:48:27.321
This is the original disk from your security
cameras that filmed this conference room.

01:48:27.406 --> 01:48:30.637
And recorded the murder... and the murderer.

01:48:31.806 --> 01:48:36.243
We are grateful to you, Yoshida-san,
for insisting that Ishihara deliver this to us.

01:48:37.086 --> 01:48:42.080
But instead... he replaced it
with this doctored version.

01:48:51.206 --> 01:48:54.004
Please. Show us the original disk.

01:48:54.086 --> 01:48:55.519
Arigato.

01:49:30.206 --> 01:49:32.003
I will deal with this.

01:49:32.086 --> 01:49:34.759
- Get out!
- Dete itte kudasai!

01:49:34.846 --> 01:49:36.757
Otoko ni mukatte nanda!

01:49:58.566 --> 01:50:00.761
They are distancing themselves.

01:50:07.566 --> 01:50:10.478
- Holy shit.
- Senator Morton.

01:50:13.686 --> 01:50:15.483
At this moment,...

01:50:15.566 --> 01:50:17.238
.. she's not dead.

01:50:17.326 --> 01:50:20.875
And now we shall find out
who actually killed her.

01:50:26.486 --> 01:50:29.796
Why was I not told this?!

01:50:29.886 --> 01:50:32.241
What has been happening here?

01:50:48.686 --> 01:50:52.998
I was protecting the situation, Yoshida-san.

01:50:57.246 --> 01:50:59.680
He has been too long in America.

01:50:59.766 --> 01:51:02.360
He has adopted many bad habits.

01:51:26.526 --> 01:51:28.517
No!

01:51:28.606 --> 01:51:31.245
It was not me.

01:51:32.806 --> 01:51:34.797
It was him!

01:51:57.406 --> 01:52:00.000
Hey, there's no running... Hey! Slow down!

01:52:05.646 --> 01:52:07.682
Hey, there's no running here!

01:52:55.166 --> 01:52:58.044
Keep eye contact at all times.

01:52:58.126 --> 01:53:01.516
And at all costs, don't lose your temper.

01:53:02.086 --> 01:53:04.077
I don't lose my temper.

01:53:09.206 --> 01:53:11.674
How are you doing, guys?
How are you doing?

01:53:11.766 --> 01:53:15.395
Konbanwa. Watashi wa...

01:53:15.486 --> 01:53:17.317
We're cops, man.

01:53:17.406 --> 01:53:20.398
Step aside, we'll have no trouble.
This is police business.

01:53:20.486 --> 01:53:22.761
It seems like nobody's listening.

01:53:28.366 --> 01:53:30.357
Come on, come on!

01:53:54.366 --> 01:53:56.357
It's me.

01:53:58.766 --> 01:54:00.438
I could have taken 'em.

01:54:00.526 --> 01:54:03.199
Their objective was not to win,
but to delay us.

01:54:03.286 --> 01:54:04.958
And they've succeeded.

01:54:15.486 --> 01:54:17.556
Eddie's friends.

01:54:18.206 --> 01:54:20.845
Looks like they've got their revenge.

01:54:24.686 --> 01:54:25.880
Shit.

01:54:28.726 --> 01:54:31.115
We gotta stop this!
We gotta do something!

01:54:33.566 --> 01:54:35.557
Do what?

01:54:37.686 --> 01:54:39.677
He's finished.

01:54:42.566 --> 01:54:44.557
That cement dries fast.

01:54:44.646 --> 01:54:48.241
And there's no way
they're gonna rip open that foundation.

01:54:48.326 --> 01:54:50.794
Everyone wants this case closed.

01:54:57.086 --> 01:54:58.439
Besides,...

01:54:58.526 --> 01:55:00.994
.. they put us on leave of absence.

01:55:10.686 --> 01:55:12.881
So, what will MicroCon do now?

01:55:12.966 --> 01:55:15.355
- Struggle on.
- We'll find a way.

01:55:15.446 --> 01:55:19.280
Or a way will find you.
I hope we can continue our friendship.

01:55:19.366 --> 01:55:22.915
- Uh, sure. Let's... Let's do lunch sometime.
- Let's do lunch.

01:55:26.006 --> 01:55:28.474
What's going to happen to him?

01:55:28.726 --> 01:55:30.796
They are retiring him.

01:55:30.886 --> 01:55:32.842
Ishihara will be given a window seat.

01:55:32.926 --> 01:55:36.805
He will spend the rest of his life in Japan,
staring out an office window.

01:55:36.886 --> 01:55:39.002
Too bad. He seemed like a heck of a guy.

01:55:39.086 --> 01:55:41.395
Personally, I got along great with him.

01:55:47.886 --> 01:55:50.241
If you sit by the river long enough,...

01:55:50.326 --> 01:55:53.636
.. you will see the body
of your enemy floating by.

01:55:54.766 --> 01:55:56.563
Connor-san.

01:55:56.646 --> 01:55:59.956
I wanna thank you.
I feel I should repay you with something.

01:56:00.046 --> 01:56:02.276
Repay me? For what?

01:56:02.366 --> 01:56:04.880
- Well...
- The key.

01:56:05.046 --> 01:56:06.684
Ah, yes. The key.

01:56:06.766 --> 01:56:10.156
The key is... don't talk about it. Just do it.

01:56:10.246 --> 01:56:12.123
The kohai talks.

01:56:12.206 --> 01:56:14.197
The sempai knows.

01:56:14.286 --> 01:56:16.277
- If I wanna be a sempai...
- No.

01:56:16.366 --> 01:56:18.084
The key.

01:56:18.486 --> 01:56:21.558
- What?
- The key to your car.

01:56:22.406 --> 01:56:24.203
Oh! Yeah.

01:56:24.286 --> 01:56:26.277
I knew that.

01:56:26.366 --> 01:56:28.721
Today at golf, we'll be discussing...

01:56:28.806 --> 01:56:32.162
.. how I can help Nakamoto
pull out of the MicroCon deal...

01:56:32.246 --> 01:56:34.396
.. without losing face.

01:56:34.486 --> 01:56:37.523
- Keiretsu interrupt us.
- Exactly.

01:56:43.846 --> 01:56:46.235
Very nice working with you, kohai.

01:56:46.326 --> 01:56:47.315
See you.

01:56:47.686 --> 01:56:49.438
See you.

01:56:49.886 --> 01:56:52.116
Yoshida-san.

01:56:53.046 --> 01:56:55.321
A perfect day for golf.

01:57:07.086 --> 01:57:11.284
Well, thanks to your help,
we were able to find out who did it.

01:57:11.926 --> 01:57:13.917
- Did you?
- Did we what?

01:57:14.006 --> 01:57:15.803
Find out?

01:57:17.086 --> 01:57:18.917
Find out? You mean who did it?

01:57:19.566 --> 01:57:21.557
Come on!

01:57:21.646 --> 01:57:24.922
You know in Japan,
the one who confesses to the murder...

01:57:25.006 --> 01:57:27.156
.. doesn't have to be the one that did it.

01:57:27.246 --> 01:57:29.601
It's an old tradition that, out of loyalty,...

01:57:29.686 --> 01:57:31.756
.. an innocent man
will take the rap for his boss.

01:57:32.686 --> 01:57:34.404
It's his duty.

01:57:34.486 --> 01:57:36.681
That's not what happened here.

01:57:36.766 --> 01:57:41.078
That Richmond guy would have done
anything to make that deal go through.

01:57:41.166 --> 01:57:43.361
He was working with Ishihara.

01:57:43.446 --> 01:57:46.836
A yuppie facilitator,
a hustling business samurai.

01:57:47.366 --> 01:57:49.482
Wave of the future.

01:57:49.566 --> 01:57:51.477
If you say so.

01:57:51.566 --> 01:57:53.045
If I say so?

01:57:53.126 --> 01:57:57.563
Look, I'm a cop.
It's my business to know these things.

01:57:57.646 --> 01:58:00.319
Besides,... what about Connor?

01:58:01.086 --> 01:58:04.317
- What about him?
- The guy's always right.

01:58:05.526 --> 01:58:07.517
If you say so.

01:58:10.766 --> 01:58:12.757
Did I say something to anger you?

01:58:12.846 --> 01:58:16.077
- No, nothing you said.
- Then, what is it?

01:58:18.086 --> 01:58:21.123
- Golf.
- Golf?

01:58:21.566 --> 01:58:23.284
I don't get it.

01:58:23.366 --> 01:58:25.243
There it is up there.

01:58:29.566 --> 01:58:31.522
You live here.

01:58:31.606 --> 01:58:33.597
428 Rose Street.

01:58:34.406 --> 01:58:36.397
Well, well, well.

01:58:38.686 --> 01:58:41.962
When I came to pick him up
that first time,...

01:58:42.046 --> 01:58:44.685
.. behind the sliding panel,...

01:58:44.766 --> 01:58:46.757
.. that was you?

01:58:48.126 --> 01:58:51.721
The gaijin that you lived with in Japan,...

01:58:52.206 --> 01:58:54.561
.. that was Connor.

01:58:54.646 --> 01:58:56.602
Thanks for giving me a lift.

01:58:56.686 --> 01:58:58.358
Wait a minute.

01:58:58.446 --> 01:59:01.119
There's some things here I don't understand.

01:59:01.206 --> 01:59:02.639
Yes.

01:59:02.726 --> 01:59:04.717
Goodbye, kohai.

01:59:05.086 --> 01:59:06.678
No, no!

01:59:07.446 --> 01:59:11.519
Now, look.
I mean, the guy, he's playing golf now.

01:59:11.726 --> 01:59:13.717
You and me, we're alone.

01:59:15.286 --> 01:59:16.878
And...

01:59:19.846 --> 01:59:22.235
I know.

01:59:22.326 --> 01:59:26.035
They say loyalty is important.
It all comes down to who you trust.

01:59:28.966 --> 01:59:30.877
Wait a minute.

01:59:30.966 --> 01:59:33.161
When he said that line about uh...

01:59:33.246 --> 01:59:37.319
.. "Always leave the cage door open
so the bird can return",...

01:59:37.406 --> 01:59:40.603
.. what the hell does that mean anyway?

01:59:41.486 --> 01:59:43.477
Who knows?

01:59:43.566 --> 01:59:46.160
When you figure it out, Web,...

01:59:46.246 --> 01:59:48.237
.. let me know.

01:59:51.486 --> 01:59:53.078
Damn!

02:00:14.326 --> 02:00:16.123
Hum.

02:00:31.646 --> 02:00:33.637
Kohai!

02:00:35.646 --> 02:00:37.637
"<u>ThE</u> <u>EnD</u>"
