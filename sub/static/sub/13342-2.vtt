01:02.375 --> 01:04.667
( music playing )

01:10.708 --> 01:13.792
- ( bell chiming )
- ( chatter )

01:20.458 --> 01:23.834
12, 13, 14,

01:23.834 --> 01:27.166
15, 16, 17.

01:27.166 --> 01:28.917
Okay, this place is huge.

01:28.917 --> 01:30.708
How much did
you say this is?

01:30.708 --> 01:32.458
It's 250.

01:32.458 --> 01:34.250
A month.

01:34.250 --> 01:36.291
It's got
really great light.

01:36.291 --> 01:40.291
Okay, what do you think
I could get for, like, 800?

01:59.417 --> 02:03.667
I mean, two thumbs
the fuck up.

02:03.667 --> 02:05.250
Well...

02:05.250 --> 02:07.083
does that mean
you want it?

02:08.250 --> 02:09.458
( screams )

02:09.458 --> 02:12.708
( music playing )

02:14.458 --> 02:16.708
( birds chirping )

02:23.041 --> 02:25.333
( music continues )

02:27.041 --> 02:30.208
( chatter )

02:35.250 --> 02:37.542
( bell dings )

02:42.333 --> 02:45.000
- Don't bother.
- What?

02:45.000 --> 02:47.834
You're in Iowa.
No one locks their bike here.

02:47.834 --> 02:50.542
- Really?
- 100%.

02:50.542 --> 02:51.917
Are you a first-year?

02:51.917 --> 02:54.125
Uh, no. Me?
I'm in graduate school.

02:54.125 --> 02:57.417
Yeah, no, you don't look
like an undergrad at all.

02:57.417 --> 02:59.250
Sorry, bro.

02:59.250 --> 03:01.125
Well, I mean,
a lot of people
think I am 19.

03:01.125 --> 03:03.708
I get carded all the time
and no one ever thinks
I'm legal,

03:03.708 --> 03:06.375
like, in the bedroom.

03:09.041 --> 03:11.667
I'm gonna
break eye contact
with you now.

03:11.667 --> 03:14.083
Let's go get
your materials.

03:14.083 --> 03:16.375
Awesome.
Are you sure
I can leave my bike?

03:16.375 --> 03:20.208
Hell, yeah.
This is Iowa.

03:20.208 --> 03:24.000
Okay, this is my living room,
which is really more like
a lounging parlor.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.583
This is my shelf
of curiosities.

03:25.583 --> 03:27.917
There's my Lubriderm.

03:27.917 --> 03:30.500
This is my kitchen.

03:30.500 --> 03:33.041
I'm sort of figuring out
the decorative scheme.

03:33.041 --> 03:36.959
Can you believe
it just took me four minutes
to show you my entire house?

03:36.959 --> 03:38.625
In New York
it would've taken
four seconds.

03:38.625 --> 03:40.458
I'm telling you,
Iowa's incredible.

03:40.458 --> 03:43.125
We should all move here
and start the revolution.

03:43.125 --> 03:44.834
No one is moving
to Iowa ever,

03:44.834 --> 03:46.625
but I'm so, so glad
you're happy.

03:46.625 --> 03:49.125
- Seriously.
- Honestly, I feel like
I made the right decision,

03:49.125 --> 03:51.333
which is a totally
new sensation for me.

03:51.333 --> 03:54.166
I mean,
I'm eating grapes
as a snack.

03:54.166 --> 03:55.750
I knew you would
do it eventually.

03:55.750 --> 03:59.458
- How's New York?
- It's really good.
And don't start.

03:59.458 --> 04:01.166
Don't start with what?

04:01.166 --> 04:03.708
I just know that you're
gonna try to talk to me
about Adam right now

04:03.708 --> 04:04.792
and you're gonna be
subtle about it.

04:04.792 --> 04:07.333
Don't start.
I'm not gonna tell you.

04:07.333 --> 04:10.625
I didn't want to talk about Adam
until you brought Adam up.

04:10.625 --> 04:14.083
- I mean, how is Adam?
- Oh, my God!

04:14.083 --> 04:16.041
Marnie, we talked about,
like, 20 things first.

04:16.041 --> 04:19.125
I just know
that whatever I tell you
is gonna make you act weird.

04:19.125 --> 04:21.583
Marnie, I've 100%
moved on, okay?

04:21.583 --> 04:25.208
I'm here, I'm totally
at one with my body
and my surroundings.

04:25.208 --> 04:28.375
- Good.
- I just want to make sure
that if he were to, say,

04:28.375 --> 04:32.083
go into to the hospital,
you would let me know.

04:32.083 --> 04:34.417
Okay, here's the deal.
If he goes into the hospital,

04:34.417 --> 04:36.500
I will tell you.
I promise.

04:36.500 --> 04:39.208
Great.
That's all I ask for.

04:39.208 --> 04:40.708
By the way,
what are you doing?

04:40.708 --> 04:43.458
You haven't knit since,
like, second semester,
freshman year,

04:43.458 --> 04:45.834
when you made the hat
for the bipolar guy.

04:45.834 --> 04:47.333
You're gonna make fun of me.

04:47.333 --> 04:51.291
- I'm knitting Desi a scarf.
- So you made him one?

04:51.291 --> 04:54.166
Why didn't you
just go to Uniqlo
like a regular person?

04:54.166 --> 04:55.542
Because I wanted
to make him one

04:55.542 --> 04:58.208
so it's, like, homemade,
and so that I'm always with him.

04:58.208 --> 05:01.708
- I don't know.
- Even when he's
with his girlfriend.

05:01.708 --> 05:03.500
This is why I'm not
telling anyone about us.

05:03.500 --> 05:06.542
You mean because
it's an affair and those
are generally kept secret?

05:06.542 --> 05:08.417
No, and stop using
that word.

05:08.417 --> 05:10.166
It's because people
are really judgmental

05:10.166 --> 05:11.542
and they're threatened
by this idea.

05:11.542 --> 05:14.750
- Mm-hmm.
- Would they be happier
if their boyfriend ha--

05:14.750 --> 05:16.208
- Marn?
- ( keyboard clicking )

05:16.208 --> 05:18.458
( no audio )

05:18.458 --> 05:21.708
Marn, your face is frozen
in a very funny position.

05:29.458 --> 05:31.000
( cash register dings )

05:31.000 --> 05:32.208
Cool, well, that's it.

05:32.208 --> 05:33.375
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

05:33.375 --> 05:35.041
Your hair looks like
it smells great.

05:35.041 --> 05:37.250
It smells so good.

05:38.667 --> 05:42.542
Must be nice
to have your parents
paying for all your shit.

05:42.542 --> 05:43.917
What?

05:43.917 --> 05:46.667
Just, you know, must be nice
to still be on the teat.

05:46.667 --> 05:50.208
I'm a graduate student,
so that's not really
my situation anymore.

05:50.208 --> 05:51.667
Okay.

05:51.667 --> 05:53.834
So, yeah, this is
four things of nuts.

05:53.834 --> 05:55.542
- Four nuts.
- Brain food.

05:55.542 --> 05:57.959
Four nuts
for a nut, right?

05:57.959 --> 05:59.458
Cool.

05:59.458 --> 06:00.875
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

06:00.875 --> 06:02.291
Oh, my God.
What did you do?

06:02.291 --> 06:05.250
It's a long story,
but the strip still works
and that's what matters.

06:05.250 --> 06:07.041
I mean, it looks like
somebody tried to cut it

06:07.041 --> 06:08.875
and then you found it
in the garbage.

06:08.875 --> 06:10.583
Nope, my card.
Says my name on it.

06:10.583 --> 06:12.875
Okay, fine.
I don't really
care anyway.

06:12.875 --> 06:14.875
Normally,
you would do this...

06:14.875 --> 06:18.291
- ( machine beeps )
- Uh-oh. It says we
gotta call Amex.

06:18.291 --> 06:20.417
- You have another card?
- Nope, let's call Amex.

06:20.417 --> 06:23.125
No, I don't want to.
Just give me another card.

06:23.125 --> 06:24.959
I said let's call Amex.

06:24.959 --> 06:26.708
If it says let's call Amex,
let's call Amex.

06:26.708 --> 06:28.792
Okay. Who travels
with one card?

06:28.792 --> 06:30.625
Just have another card.

06:30.625 --> 06:32.708
- Can you call Amex?
- Absolutely, yeah.

06:32.708 --> 06:34.708
- Thank you so much.
- Customer's always right.

06:34.708 --> 06:35.959
Thank you.

06:35.959 --> 06:38.625
That's not true,
though.

06:46.792 --> 06:48.917
Yeah, don't bother.
You're in the dead zone.

06:48.917 --> 06:51.542
It's, like, this block
and, like, 200 feet that way.

06:51.542 --> 06:53.708
Yeah, but my phone
worked here earlier.

06:53.708 --> 06:55.500
Yeah, I don't know.
It's weird and random.

06:55.500 --> 06:57.208
Phones work
at the yacht club, though.

06:57.208 --> 06:59.125
You should come by.
Battle of the Bands tonight.

06:59.125 --> 07:02.208
I'm drumming...
in both bands.

07:07.333 --> 07:09.792
( dogs barking in distance )

07:36.834 --> 07:39.708
( item thuds, rattles )

07:39.708 --> 07:42.208
( wings fluttering )

07:51.583 --> 07:55.250
( fluttering continues )

07:57.166 --> 07:58.708
( screams )

07:58.708 --> 08:00.375
No!

08:00.375 --> 08:03.000
( fluttering continues )

08:06.708 --> 08:09.041
( screams )

08:09.041 --> 08:10.542
No!

08:10.542 --> 08:11.750
There's a bat.

08:11.750 --> 08:15.417
( whimpering )

08:23.166 --> 08:25.708
( door handle rattling )

08:25.708 --> 08:27.458
Fuck.

08:44.250 --> 08:45.500
( thuds )

08:45.500 --> 08:49.208
( bat squeaking )

08:49.208 --> 08:52.917
( exhaling )

09:04.542 --> 09:07.166
( birds chirping )

09:13.834 --> 09:15.708
Fuck, shit!

09:15.708 --> 09:17.959
( sighs, blows raspberry )

09:21.917 --> 09:23.125
Ow.

09:36.959 --> 09:38.458
Man:
"She comes home after work

09:38.458 --> 09:40.834
smelling of cheap beer
and menthols,

09:40.834 --> 09:44.667
grabbing at her cheek,
crying over her rotting tooth.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.917
'Looks like a fuckin'
black hole,' she says.

09:46.917 --> 09:49.708
'How do they expect me
to bag groceries when
I got this pain?'

09:49.708 --> 09:53.000
She smokes some of the pot
I got her from my buddy Whiz.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.166
'Give Mommy a kiss.
I love you,' she says.

09:57.166 --> 10:01.708
I go to my room
and draw pictures
of her rotting tooth."

10:05.959 --> 10:09.000
Thank you, D. August.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.750
Who wants to say
what the story was about?

10:10.750 --> 10:12.667
First of all,
I just want to say

10:12.667 --> 10:14.834
that I thought this
was one of the best pieces

10:14.834 --> 10:16.959
that I've read
in this program so far,

10:16.959 --> 10:21.125
- and I'm a second-year.
- Ah.

10:21.125 --> 10:22.834
Gut-wrenching.

10:22.834 --> 10:26.417
And not asking
to wrench our guts.

10:26.417 --> 10:28.708
Just wrenching them.

10:29.792 --> 10:32.750
Chester, hi.
Chester Chong.

10:32.750 --> 10:34.250
- Hi.
- Hey, what's up?

10:34.250 --> 10:35.875
- Chester.
- Um, hi.

10:35.875 --> 10:38.917
I liked how the language
was really spare but cutting,

10:38.917 --> 10:40.542
and I thought you played
with gender in a way

10:40.542 --> 10:45.667
that was really surprising
and, like, almost offensive
but not offensive.

10:45.667 --> 10:48.750
- Man: It's a really fine line.
- Yeah, he's just walking it.

10:48.750 --> 10:50.625
- It's really good.
- Yeah.

10:50.625 --> 10:52.083
I agree.

10:52.083 --> 10:56.875
Man, I would literally cut
my arm off or pay you
everything I have

10:56.875 --> 10:58.875
just to write
three more pages of that.

10:58.875 --> 11:02.083
I need to know more,
please.

11:02.083 --> 11:04.375
Well, I assume
the mom dies.

11:06.041 --> 11:09.792
Okay, let's change
focus here.
Hannah?

11:09.792 --> 11:12.959
Okay, so I just
wanted to say that I know
you've all read the story

11:12.959 --> 11:14.375
in the privacy
of your own homes,

11:14.375 --> 11:17.083
but hearing me
read it aloud here today

11:17.083 --> 11:19.792
may bring up some of the more
triggering aspects of the piece,

11:19.792 --> 11:22.834
so I just want you to feel free
to quietly leave the room

11:22.834 --> 11:26.792
or express your
emotional reaction
in any way that feels safe,

11:26.792 --> 11:30.917
even if that is
kind of a darker expression.

11:30.917 --> 11:32.583
Okay, here goes.

11:32.583 --> 11:34.792
This story's called
"Contact."

11:36.417 --> 11:37.917
"There was no going back.

11:37.917 --> 11:41.417
There were new rules now,
new reasons for him to call.

11:41.417 --> 11:43.917
He made choices
and I obeyed.

11:43.917 --> 11:46.667
I let him press his thumb
so hard into my neck

11:46.667 --> 11:47.959
that blue marks appeared.

11:47.959 --> 11:51.250
I let him bend my limbs
ways they didn't go,

11:51.250 --> 11:53.083
and once his arm
reared back

11:53.083 --> 11:56.458
and his fist
landed with a thud
on my collar bone,

11:56.458 --> 12:00.708
like sex,
that didn't feel like
anything I thought it would.

12:00.708 --> 12:03.208
He moved me
where I had to go.

12:03.208 --> 12:04.959
The goal
was not to say no,

12:04.959 --> 12:09.250
and so it didn't
matter if I was good
in my choicelessness.

12:09.250 --> 12:11.125
I was free for a moment."

12:14.625 --> 12:17.667
Okay, what is
this story about?

12:17.667 --> 12:19.542
It's about
a really privileged girl

12:19.542 --> 12:21.792
deciding that
she's just gonna let
someone abuse her.

12:21.792 --> 12:23.875
Man:
Yeah, that's what
it's about.

12:23.875 --> 12:26.959
Honestly,
I was very distracted
by how "Fifty Shades" it was.

12:26.959 --> 12:28.417
I actually haven't read
"Fifty Shades of"--

12:28.417 --> 12:31.625
Hannah, you know
you have to sit tight
until we're done discussing.

12:31.625 --> 12:33.041
Okay.

12:33.041 --> 12:36.291
In some ways,
I was struggling
not to be offended

12:36.291 --> 12:38.000
because it seemed
to really trivialize

12:38.000 --> 12:40.166
the very real abuse
suffered by some.

12:40.166 --> 12:41.542
I don't know
if anybody else
felt that way.

12:41.542 --> 12:43.708
- Chester: Yeah.
- That was just one paragraph.

12:43.708 --> 12:45.041
Hannah.

12:45.041 --> 12:47.333
Anything else?

12:49.291 --> 12:51.083
No?

12:51.083 --> 12:52.583
Okay.

12:52.583 --> 12:54.667
What's working?

12:56.625 --> 12:59.041
I'm sorry, I have
to say something.

12:59.041 --> 13:02.291
I'm actually
really struggling with how
to talk about this piece.

13:02.291 --> 13:04.959
Like, I tried
writing my notes
for Hannah last night,

13:04.959 --> 13:06.834
but I think there's
a larger issue here,

13:06.834 --> 13:09.583
which is how are we
supposed to critique a work

13:09.583 --> 13:13.500
which is very clearly based
directly from the author's
personal experience?

13:13.500 --> 13:15.041
- Mm.
- Hmm.

13:15.041 --> 13:16.583
I had the chance to speak
with Hannah yesterday

13:16.583 --> 13:18.875
and she is very much
this character.

13:18.875 --> 13:20.875
- Woman: Hmm.
- Man: Yeah.

13:20.875 --> 13:23.959
Teacher:
Because this is
a fiction workshop,

13:23.959 --> 13:27.375
I think we need to treat
every piece we receive in here

13:27.375 --> 13:28.667
as a work of fiction.

13:28.667 --> 13:32.917
Uh, but I have
the same problem,
and I've never even met her.

13:32.917 --> 13:37.083
It's just-- look at her.
She's obviously her.

13:37.083 --> 13:41.875
I mean, the main character
is a girl with a lot
of tattoos named Anna.

13:41.875 --> 13:46.708
Who needs
to eat every two hours
or she passes out.

13:46.708 --> 13:50.333
Well, even if the character
was named Hannah,

13:50.333 --> 13:51.792
it doesn't mean
it's about her.

13:51.792 --> 13:53.542
I mean, writers
do that all the time.

13:53.542 --> 13:54.625
We know that, right?

13:54.625 --> 13:56.792
And if it's about her,
so what?

13:56.792 --> 13:59.041
Who fucking cares?
This is her voice.

13:59.041 --> 14:00.208
This is who she is.

14:00.208 --> 14:02.500
We can't squash her voice
of what she's trying to say.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.041
Totally, D. August.

14:04.041 --> 14:07.041
As usual, you hit
the nail on the head.

14:07.041 --> 14:09.375
That's not really
my problem with her piece.

14:09.375 --> 14:13.792
I definitely felt
a lack of sympathy towards
the male perspective

14:13.792 --> 14:16.333
and some stunted
feminist idea--

14:16.333 --> 14:19.250
- I'm sorry,
can I say one thing?
- No, not yet. Not yet.

14:19.250 --> 14:21.917
- Five words.
- No, I know it's hard,
but just not yet.

14:21.917 --> 14:24.125
- One word.
- Hannah.

14:24.125 --> 14:25.667
History.

14:25.667 --> 14:28.583
History didn't really focus
on the female perspective.

14:29.583 --> 14:31.166
I forgot
what I was saying.

14:31.166 --> 14:33.458
Woman:
Stunted feminist idea.

14:33.458 --> 14:35.208
Yeah, for me it would be
much more interesting

14:35.208 --> 14:38.667
if there was
a complex examination
about the real ways

14:38.667 --> 14:41.250
that people challenge
each other sexually.

14:41.250 --> 14:43.250
( chatter )

14:43.250 --> 14:46.834
- You coming?
- Do they have onion rings
at the Fox Head?

14:46.834 --> 14:49.000
( laughs )

14:49.000 --> 14:50.291
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:50.291 --> 14:52.000
You headed
for the Fox Head?

14:52.000 --> 14:54.708
No, I'm just gonna go home
and metabolize the notes
that I was given,

14:54.708 --> 14:56.625
figure out a way
to integrate them
into my work

14:56.625 --> 14:58.125
in a fashion
that makes sense to me.

14:58.125 --> 15:00.834
No, no, no, no,
you gotta go or everybody
thinks you're a baby.

15:00.834 --> 15:02.500
No one's gonna think
I'm a baby.

15:02.500 --> 15:06.166
- I'm metabolizing my notes.
- Look, you're gonna go through
a lot of these, okay?

15:06.166 --> 15:09.834
So, suck it up.
I'll see you there,
all right?

15:09.834 --> 15:12.417
I'm not stressed!

15:18.542 --> 15:21.500
No fucking way.

15:25.083 --> 15:26.708
Hello?

15:28.917 --> 15:30.708
Please bring
my bike back!

15:30.708 --> 15:33.083
- ( bike bell rings )
- Woman: I mean, look.

15:33.083 --> 15:35.083
That is the danger
of conferences, right?

15:35.083 --> 15:38.333
They really attract, like,
the lowest common denominator
who don't want to write.

15:38.333 --> 15:39.583
They just want to talk
about writing.

15:39.583 --> 15:41.708
- Man: It's awful.
- I don't mean that
in a bad way.

15:41.708 --> 15:44.125
- I just mean--
- I'm just gonna
get another beer.

15:44.125 --> 15:45.667
Do you guys
want anything?

15:45.667 --> 15:47.834
- Hannah: We're cool.
- No, thanks.

15:47.834 --> 15:51.834
Honestly, Logan, I felt
so misunderstood in class.

15:51.834 --> 15:55.166
Oh, yeah.
I can understand
that feeling, you know?

15:55.166 --> 15:58.875
But you have to understand
it's all just a part
of one big process.

15:58.875 --> 16:03.333
Because in the real world,
let's just say you were to
actually get "published."

16:03.333 --> 16:06.333
I mean, you can't go to
everybody's house individually
and defend your work, you know?

16:06.333 --> 16:09.125
It's important
to know how your work
comes across to a reader.

16:09.125 --> 16:12.875
I know, but, like,
okay, just here alone,
woman to woman,

16:12.875 --> 16:14.375
you don't have
to put on a show,

16:14.375 --> 16:17.291
you didn't actually think
the piece was insensitive

16:17.291 --> 16:20.250
to sufferers
of abuse, did you?

16:20.250 --> 16:23.208
That is
how I perceived it.

16:23.208 --> 16:25.083
But it's just a story.

16:25.083 --> 16:28.208
Stories can be
very powerful, Hannah.

16:30.375 --> 16:31.917
Oh, my God.

16:31.917 --> 16:33.250
What's wrong?

16:33.250 --> 16:35.667
You're a survivor
of abuse.

16:35.667 --> 16:37.208
( laughs )
What?

16:37.208 --> 16:39.041
Of course you're gonna
be sensitive to it.

16:39.041 --> 16:40.625
You have a right
to be sensitive to it.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.291
You're a survivor
of abuse.

16:42.291 --> 16:44.250
Hannah, I don't know
what you're talking about.

16:44.250 --> 16:46.333
I knew aspects of the story
would be triggering,

16:46.333 --> 16:49.875
but I didn't imagine
just how close to home
it would hit.

16:49.875 --> 16:52.750
Okay, great,
you don't know
what I'm talking about.

16:52.750 --> 16:54.333
You don't know
what you're talking about.

16:54.333 --> 16:56.166
And my story
isn't about the time

16:56.166 --> 16:57.834
that I took
a couple Quaaludes

16:57.834 --> 16:59.750
and asked my boyfriend
to punch me in the chest.

16:59.750 --> 17:01.250
TMI, Hannah.
TMI.

17:01.250 --> 17:03.333
By the way, TMI is such
an outdated concept.

17:03.333 --> 17:05.083
There's no such thing
as too much information.

17:05.083 --> 17:06.750
This is
the Information Age.

17:06.750 --> 17:08.750
We're all just here
to express ourselves,

17:08.750 --> 17:11.375
so it's like
to censor each other?

17:11.375 --> 17:15.500
We're no better than...
George W. Bush.

17:15.500 --> 17:17.583
Woman on TV:
When you licked my face,

17:17.583 --> 17:19.666
when you put your tongue
on my cheek,

17:19.666 --> 17:21.750
apparently that was
just what you needed

17:21.750 --> 17:24.750
to get in the mood
to rip out my molars, right?

17:24.750 --> 17:27.791
I hope someday
I know the passion
that Huck feels for Quinn.

17:27.791 --> 17:30.208
Woman on TV:
But your tongue in my mouth?

17:30.208 --> 17:31.583
That's different.

17:31.583 --> 17:34.333
- You put your tongue
in my mouth...
- ( phone ringing )

17:34.333 --> 17:36.417
...and now I deserve
to live?

17:36.417 --> 17:39.333
- That's a thing?
- Okay, it's, like,
just a bunch of zeroes.

17:39.333 --> 17:41.458
Jessa:
Prison.

17:44.333 --> 17:45.458
Hello?

17:45.458 --> 17:47.291
Automated voice:
You have a collect call from...

17:47.291 --> 17:48.667
This is Hannah.
My phone broke.

17:48.667 --> 17:49.875
Hello? What?
Hannah?

17:49.875 --> 17:51.625
Automated voice:
To accept this call,
press one.

17:51.625 --> 17:53.792
Dude, something insane
is happening right now.

17:53.792 --> 17:57.083
- It's Hannah?
- Can you hear me?
This is a--

17:57.083 --> 17:59.417
Automated voice:
Please enter your choice now.

17:59.417 --> 18:01.792
I, like,
can't understand her.
It's really fast.

18:01.792 --> 18:03.208
Hannah's voice:
This is Hannah.
My phone broke.

18:03.208 --> 18:05.083
- Automated voice:
...is calling collect.
- Can you hear me?

18:05.083 --> 18:07.000
Automated voice:
To accept charges,
press 1 now.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.166
Accept the call!

18:08.166 --> 18:10.667
- Should I pause?
- Hello?

18:10.667 --> 18:12.125
Have you ever heard
of a collect call...

18:12.125 --> 18:15.000
- ( dial tone humming )
- ...you motherfucking cunts?

18:18.417 --> 18:21.667
( beeping )

18:23.625 --> 18:25.500
Automated voice:
Say your name after the tone.

18:25.500 --> 18:28.166
- ( beeps )
- This is your daughter Hannah.
Please pick up.

18:28.166 --> 18:30.083
- Honey?
- Is it Hannah?

18:30.083 --> 18:32.000
Yeah, collect.
She's calling collect.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.291
- Accept the charges.
- ( line beeps )

18:33.291 --> 18:36.792
- Hi.
- Loreen: Honey,
what happened to your phone?

18:36.792 --> 18:38.792
Tad:
Ask her what happened
to her phone.

18:38.792 --> 18:42.041
Oh, I just dropped it
in a creek 'cause I was...

18:42.041 --> 18:44.875
creek walking
with just a group
of my new friends.

18:44.875 --> 18:47.375
Oh, that's nice.
She has a bunch
of new friends.

18:47.375 --> 18:49.542
- Yeah? Ask her
what their names are.
- What are their names?

18:49.542 --> 18:52.000
Oh, their names
are Shannon...

18:52.000 --> 18:53.125
- Shannon.
- Shannon.

18:53.125 --> 18:54.834
- ...Jeff...
- Jeff.

18:54.834 --> 18:56.542
- Okay.
- ...Jonesly...

18:56.542 --> 18:57.375
Jonesly.

18:57.375 --> 18:59.875
...Rancheny, Nagasaki,
and Cher.

18:59.875 --> 19:01.375
Loreen:
There are a bunch.

19:01.375 --> 19:04.375
Hey, tell us more.
Have you had class yet?

19:04.375 --> 19:05.708
Uh, no, I didn't
have class yet.

19:05.708 --> 19:09.667
Just getting ready
and, you know, hangin'
with the new pals.

19:09.667 --> 19:12.000
Hey, Mommy,
can I ask you
a question?

19:12.000 --> 19:13.208
Sure, of course.

19:13.208 --> 19:15.083
Is it normal when you
get to a new place

19:15.083 --> 19:17.708
to think about suicide
for the first time ever?

19:17.708 --> 19:21.125
- What?
- Not that you want
to do it or anything.

19:21.125 --> 19:22.208
Just that you could do it.

19:22.208 --> 19:23.542
You're thinking
about ways to do it

19:23.542 --> 19:25.166
that never occurred
to you before, you know?

19:25.166 --> 19:27.375
Just like cutting off
your own wrist.

19:27.375 --> 19:29.083
I don't know.
It's just that
it's the only way

19:29.083 --> 19:31.708
to get out of
your current situation
that you're in.

19:31.708 --> 19:34.166
Yeah, I think
that's normal.

19:34.166 --> 19:36.959
I mean, whenever
I'm on a very high building,

19:36.959 --> 19:42.208
I always think
I could jump.

19:42.208 --> 19:43.792
- Just because.
- You do.

19:43.792 --> 19:47.041
Honey, can you ask Hannah
to call us back when we're
done with the game?

19:47.041 --> 19:48.750
Ooh, your dad wants us
to call you back.

19:48.750 --> 19:50.083
I think he has
a really good word.

19:50.083 --> 19:52.417
- Wait.
- We'll call you right back,
okay, sweetie?

19:52.417 --> 19:55.417
- Tad: I think I can make...
- ( dial tone humming )

20:11.750 --> 20:13.458
Who opened the door?!

20:15.291 --> 20:17.166
I'm not kidding!

20:18.333 --> 20:20.875
I have a self-defense
keychain

20:20.875 --> 20:24.875
that I bought
illegally, okay?

20:24.875 --> 20:27.750
And I can slice you

20:27.750 --> 20:30.458
from top to bottom!

20:32.000 --> 20:34.125
Hello?

20:34.125 --> 20:35.583
- Hello?
- ( door opens )

20:35.583 --> 20:37.291
I have a family!
( screams )

20:37.291 --> 20:41.500
- What are you even doing?!
- Calm down.

20:41.500 --> 20:42.959
On the way here
from the airport,

20:42.959 --> 20:46.625
two people asked me
if I was Blake Lively's
husband.

20:46.625 --> 20:48.166
Iowa is amazing!

20:48.166 --> 20:51.000
- What are you doing here?
- Well, your last text
was sort of a bummer,

20:51.000 --> 20:53.417
so I figured
maybe you could use
a candy striper.

20:53.417 --> 20:55.000
Elijah, I can't use
a candy striper.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.166
I'm in the midst
of a very intense--

20:58.166 --> 21:00.166
- I love you.
- I love you.

21:00.166 --> 21:01.417
I love you.

21:01.417 --> 21:04.333
But there's no way
that you came here
just to be nice to me.

21:04.333 --> 21:06.208
Okay, well,
that hurts my feelings.

21:06.208 --> 21:08.667
Honestly, New York
was just too grotesque.

21:08.667 --> 21:11.166
I mean, I just feel
like a fucking loser.

21:11.166 --> 21:13.000
I just keep running
into people that
I've slept with,

21:13.000 --> 21:17.166
and then last week
I saw a homeless woman
fist herself on my stoop.

21:17.166 --> 21:18.333
No.

21:18.333 --> 21:19.834
It's like
I've had enough.

21:19.834 --> 21:21.500
- I love you so much.
- I love you, too.

21:21.500 --> 21:25.166
- I hate everyone
who isn't you.
- Me, too.

21:25.166 --> 21:27.583
- I've been
saying that for years.
- ( whimpers )

21:27.583 --> 21:29.667
Why don't you change
out of whatever this is,

21:29.667 --> 21:32.625
'cause we're
gonna go to a rager
on North Linn Street!

21:32.625 --> 21:35.041
Elijah, I would love
to go to a rager,
but I'm sorry.

21:35.041 --> 21:37.041
I have to, you know,
revise my story

21:37.041 --> 21:40.208
and meditate
on Priya's story and--

21:40.208 --> 21:41.792
let's forget who we are.

21:41.792 --> 21:43.041
That's why I'm here.

21:43.041 --> 21:45.542
- Your body looks amazing.
- Oh, thanks.

21:45.542 --> 21:48.166
I haven't seen
your pubic hair
in a long time.

21:48.166 --> 21:49.208
I just grew it back.
