WEBVTT

00:02.403 --> 00:04.605
- I am so ready for this.

00:04.638 --> 00:07.541
[cheers and applause]

00:12.313 --> 00:17.818
Ah!
- Ah!

00:17.851 --> 00:19.553
What are you doing here?

00:19.587 --> 00:22.290
- Setting up for a romantic
evening with my boyfriend.

00:22.323 --> 00:24.492
I would've done it at my place,
but rich people

00:24.525 --> 00:27.495
have such nice lighting.
What are you doing here?

00:27.528 --> 00:29.197
- I'm the rich person
with the nice lighting

00:29.230 --> 00:31.732
that owns this apartment.

00:31.765 --> 00:33.634
Wait. You and Beau,
that's tonight?

00:33.667 --> 00:35.436
Don't look at this.

00:35.469 --> 00:38.906
- What is that
giant, gold monstrosity?

00:38.939 --> 00:42.576
- It's a gift I made for you.

00:42.610 --> 00:46.314
- Oh, I love it.

00:46.347 --> 00:50.384
- Did I miss anything?
[applause]

00:50.418 --> 00:52.353
Oh, you gave it
to her without me?

00:52.386 --> 00:55.756
- Yeah, and her reaction
was priceless.

00:55.789 --> 00:58.092
- Just a little something
for you and Beau

00:58.126 --> 01:02.496
as you begin this beautiful
journey together as partners.

01:02.530 --> 01:07.268
We thought you could stand on
either side of it and be all--

01:07.301 --> 01:09.470
- Thank you.

01:09.503 --> 01:13.274
Wow. I can't believe Beau
is going to propose

01:13.307 --> 01:15.509
that we do a channel together.

01:15.543 --> 01:17.978
After years of doing
"iCarly" with Sam

01:18.011 --> 01:20.348
and then hosting Italian QVC

01:20.381 --> 01:22.416
and then my brief stint
in college radio,

01:22.450 --> 01:25.353
I'm finally going to be back
online where I belong,

01:25.386 --> 01:28.356
with a partner
who I love and trust.

01:28.389 --> 01:29.890
Now, where should
I put my phone,

01:29.923 --> 01:31.992
so I can secretly record him?

01:32.025 --> 01:33.961
- Now that's true love.

01:33.994 --> 01:37.598
- I told all the "iCarly" fans
to tune in to my livestream.

01:37.631 --> 01:41.135
Beau asking me to do a channel
together, that's good content.

01:41.169 --> 01:42.670
Why waste it?

01:42.703 --> 01:45.072
- Couldn't agree more,
which is why after Spencer

01:45.105 --> 01:46.607
designed this sculpture,

01:46.640 --> 01:50.978
I outfitted it with a sneaky,
little spot for a camera.

01:51.011 --> 01:52.546
Mm...

01:52.580 --> 01:54.047
boop.

01:54.081 --> 01:56.750
- Freddie, this is why we
stayed friends all these years,

01:56.784 --> 01:58.886
you creepy genius.

01:58.919 --> 02:00.721
- I actually did the whole
making it part,

02:00.754 --> 02:04.925
so, you know,
who's the real creepy genius?

02:04.958 --> 02:06.527
- This is so exciting.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.229
I've been wanting to start up
my own channel again,

02:08.262 --> 02:10.631
but I didn't want
to do it by myself.

02:10.664 --> 02:12.366
You know what? He's probably
going to be here any minute,

02:12.400 --> 02:15.336
and I love you guys so much,
but get.

02:19.840 --> 02:23.211
Hey, everyone. I'm back.
I know it's been a while,

02:23.244 --> 02:26.447
but you guys are in
for something really exciting.

02:26.480 --> 02:27.848
- Carly?
- Beau.

02:27.881 --> 02:29.483
- Hey.

02:29.517 --> 02:31.785
Cool shape.

02:31.819 --> 02:35.856
- Yeah, it's an and symbol
for Carly and Beau.

02:35.889 --> 02:37.258
Doesn't it make you

02:37.291 --> 02:39.760
just want to stand on
either side of it be all--

02:39.793 --> 02:41.862
- Sure, kind of.

02:41.895 --> 02:45.366
But for now, let's sit
and be all--

02:47.668 --> 02:49.903
Carly,
we do a lot of things together.

02:49.937 --> 02:53.073
- I know. It's so great.
- We date.

02:53.106 --> 02:54.708
We share a Spotify account.

02:54.742 --> 02:57.378
You came with me
to the podiatrist.

02:57.411 --> 02:59.247
- I just get you.

02:59.280 --> 03:01.382
- So I think it's only natural
we--

03:01.415 --> 03:03.851
- Start a channel together.
- Need some time apart.

03:03.884 --> 03:09.357
Wait. What?
Time apart? Why?

03:09.390 --> 03:10.824
- We gotta get the phone.

03:10.858 --> 03:13.026
- You came with me
to the podiatrist.

03:13.060 --> 03:15.296
- Well, yeah, but that's just
because your podiatrist is next

03:15.329 --> 03:17.030
to the good dumpling place.

03:17.064 --> 03:18.899
- Could've done takeout.

03:18.932 --> 03:22.236
- They're not as good
at room temperature.

03:22.270 --> 03:25.005
Deep down, you know that.

03:27.375 --> 03:28.809
- I love you.

03:28.842 --> 03:31.979
I just need a little space,
just for a minute.

03:32.012 --> 03:36.116
- Oh, space, yeah.
I'm fine with space.

03:36.149 --> 03:40.053
I love space. It's really nice
because it teaches you

03:40.087 --> 03:43.924
to appreciate what you had
before you took all the space.

03:43.957 --> 03:47.695
So how long are we
talking here, like, a week?

03:47.728 --> 03:50.998
- Maybe a little longer.
- Two?

03:53.634 --> 03:56.203
You're just dumping me,
aren't you?

03:56.236 --> 03:59.206
- Yah! Yah!

04:01.475 --> 04:06.179
- Now I have a broken heart
and a broken phone.

04:06.213 --> 04:10.784
Awesome. It's still working
and live-streaming everything.

04:13.821 --> 04:18.258
- I think people will see
that it was a mutual thing.

04:18.292 --> 04:20.994
[upbeat music]

04:21.028 --> 04:23.964
*

04:23.997 --> 04:26.166
- * I know you see

04:26.199 --> 04:28.636
* Somehow the world
will change for me *

04:28.669 --> 04:32.873
[together]
* And be so wonderful

04:32.906 --> 04:35.275
- * Live life, breathe air

04:35.309 --> 04:37.811
* I know somehow
we're gonna get there *

04:37.845 --> 04:42.383
[together]
* And feel so wonderful

04:42.416 --> 04:46.019
* It's all for real

04:46.053 --> 04:48.288
- * I'm telling you
just how I feel *

04:48.322 --> 04:52.125
* So wake up the members
of my nation *

04:52.159 --> 04:53.927
[together]
* It's your time to be

04:53.961 --> 04:56.897
- * There's no chance
unless you take one *

04:56.930 --> 04:59.633
* And the time to see
the brighter side *

04:59.667 --> 05:02.836
* Of every situation

05:02.870 --> 05:04.505
* Some things
are meant to be *

05:04.538 --> 05:08.175
* So give me your best
and leave the rest to me *

05:08.208 --> 05:10.644
* Leave it all to me

05:10.678 --> 05:12.580
* Leave it all
to me *

05:12.613 --> 05:15.649
* Just leave it all to me

05:18.419 --> 05:20.621
[upbeat music]

05:20.654 --> 05:22.790
*

05:30.731 --> 05:31.765
- [sighs]

05:31.799 --> 05:33.166
Is it that time of day where

05:33.200 --> 05:34.968
you drag your depression
down the hall

05:35.002 --> 05:38.271
from Spencer's apartment
to ours?

05:38.305 --> 05:40.674
- He's getting ready
for a sculpture premier party.

05:40.708 --> 05:41.942
I just want to stay here

05:41.975 --> 05:44.578
and re-watch every episode
of "Law & Order."

05:44.612 --> 05:47.381
The murders will cheer me up.

05:47.415 --> 05:50.451
- We're going to that party.
- [groans]

05:50.484 --> 05:52.686
- Come on.
- Harper.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.221
You don't even like Spencer.

05:54.254 --> 05:55.489
- Yes, I do.

05:55.523 --> 05:56.924
Why am I lying?
The man is a ding-dong.

05:56.957 --> 06:01.529
But I do find the dumber
the man, the better the party.

06:01.562 --> 06:03.196
- Of course you want to go.

06:03.230 --> 06:05.933
For you, parties are a
never-ending buffet of people

06:05.966 --> 06:07.635
who want to sleep with you.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.837
Cute guys, hot girls,

06:09.870 --> 06:11.939
ridiculously gorgeous,
non-binary lawyers

06:11.972 --> 06:13.941
who get your name tattooed
on their thigh.

06:13.974 --> 06:16.109
- That only happened twice.

06:16.143 --> 06:17.678
- Me, on the other hand,

06:17.711 --> 06:20.313
I feel like my face is now
physically incapable

06:20.347 --> 06:21.949
of smiling.

06:21.982 --> 06:26.319
- Carly, look--
[phone ringing]

06:26.353 --> 06:28.756
- [gasps]

06:28.789 --> 06:30.123
- Beau's calling?

06:30.157 --> 06:31.525
- I can't talk to him.

06:31.559 --> 06:33.126
I'm not dating.
I'm not making videos.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.862
I'm too embarrassed
about my life.

06:34.895 --> 06:38.265
- You should be. Your legs look
like Eugene Levy's eyebrows.

06:38.298 --> 06:39.900
- You said that was feminist.

06:39.933 --> 06:43.971
- Carly, look,
I know this is hard.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.539
When my family lost
all their money,

06:45.573 --> 06:46.774
all I wanted to do was curl up

06:46.807 --> 06:48.175
on the deck
of our 50-foot sailboat

06:48.208 --> 06:52.379
and cry, but I didn't.
You know why?

06:52.412 --> 06:54.782
- Because your dad sunk it
for insurance.

06:54.815 --> 06:58.652
- And because I decided to look
at it as an opportunity.

06:58.686 --> 07:00.153
I picked myself up.

07:00.187 --> 07:02.790
I applied for every job
I could think of,

07:02.823 --> 07:05.258
and they all said
I was unqualified.

07:05.292 --> 07:08.596
Then I got a minimum-wage job
as Skybucks,

07:08.629 --> 07:11.999
and I'm still there
four years later.

07:12.032 --> 07:14.635
- It had a happy-ending tone,
but--

07:14.668 --> 07:16.504
- Because it is happy.

07:16.537 --> 07:19.039
Accessorizing that
tacky-ass apron made me realize

07:19.072 --> 07:20.808
that I want to be a stylist,

07:20.841 --> 07:23.644
and now I have a job
and a dream

07:23.677 --> 07:26.246
and all
the half-and-half I can drink.

07:26.279 --> 07:30.417
- You're lactose intolerant.
- My body, my choice.

07:30.450 --> 07:34.221
Go to this party,
take the first step,

07:34.254 --> 07:36.056
and if you don't take
the first step

07:36.089 --> 07:40.027
in those black ankle boots,
can I borrow them?

07:40.060 --> 07:44.431
*

07:44.464 --> 07:46.500
- Wow. I thought I was early,

07:46.534 --> 07:48.602
but there are so many people
here already.

07:48.636 --> 07:51.271
- They're servers.
I had them dress like guests,

07:51.304 --> 07:53.406
so my friends wouldn't be all,
"Ooh, look at Spencer

07:53.440 --> 07:55.509
"with his waiters
and his remodeled apartment

07:55.543 --> 07:59.112
and his Swarovski crystal
boxer briefs."

07:59.146 --> 08:00.280
Still just a regular guy.

08:00.313 --> 08:03.183
- Gold-leaf martini?
- Yes, please.

08:03.216 --> 08:04.451
You can really taste
the gold.

08:04.484 --> 08:08.488
- Mm, Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

08:08.522 --> 08:10.257
- You earned your success.
You're the guy

08:10.290 --> 08:12.526
who made the marshmallow
White House sculpture.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.361
The way that it was half melted
to reflect

08:14.394 --> 08:19.199
our disintegrating democracy,
such a brave statement.

08:19.232 --> 08:21.501
- It was an accident.

08:21.535 --> 08:23.203
I left it next
to my cell phone,

08:23.236 --> 08:25.773
which broke out
into a spontaneous fire.

08:25.806 --> 08:29.276
Anyway, now I own
a falcon named Jericho.

08:29.309 --> 08:33.046
- [chuckles] Wow.
I clearly did it all wrong.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.082
Pursued my dreams,
married for love.

08:35.115 --> 08:36.884
Two divorces and a failed
start-up later,

08:36.917 --> 08:38.919
I'm back living with my mom.

08:38.952 --> 08:40.954
Maybe instead of figuring out
my next tech venture,

08:40.988 --> 08:43.456
I'll just melt
some marshmallows.

08:43.490 --> 08:46.459
- I'll sue you into the ground.
[clicks tongue]

08:46.493 --> 08:47.628
- Wow.
I clearly did it all wrong.

08:47.661 --> 08:48.962
Oh, no.

08:48.996 --> 08:50.831
Pursued my dreams,
married for love--

08:50.864 --> 08:52.600
Millicent, do not post that.

08:52.633 --> 08:55.302
- [shushes]
I'm making content.

08:55.335 --> 08:57.204
- Told you just stop
recording me.

08:57.237 --> 08:58.739
I'm back living with my mom.

08:58.772 --> 09:01.141
- Just because you adopted me
doesn't make you my dad.

09:01.174 --> 09:02.610
- I'm back living with my mom.

09:02.643 --> 09:07.681
Literally, it does.
That is exactly what it means.

09:07.715 --> 09:10.217
- And send.

09:10.250 --> 09:13.420
Can you like it
to give it some traction?

09:13.453 --> 09:18.425
- "Can you like it to give it
some traction, please?"

09:18.458 --> 09:21.061
- I'm setting a timer
for exactly five minutes.

09:21.094 --> 09:24.064
After that, it's back to numbly
eating frozen french fries

09:24.097 --> 09:25.666
straight from the bag.

09:25.699 --> 09:28.301
- Oh, good. You guys came.
So what did you bring the host?

09:28.335 --> 09:33.573
- It's half-and-half.
Where's the bar?

09:33.607 --> 09:36.910
- Hi, Carly.
How's retirement?

09:36.944 --> 09:38.245
- I'm not retired.

09:38.278 --> 09:40.180
- You haven't posted
for a month.

09:40.213 --> 09:43.316
In internet years,
that's a decade.

09:43.350 --> 09:46.887
It's okay, Carly.
Go into the light.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.890
- Your channel
has two subscribers.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.558
I know.
I'm one of them.

09:51.591 --> 09:55.729
- Ugh. Now people are going to
think my channel is for olds.

09:55.763 --> 09:58.899
- Okay, can I have
everyone's attention, please?

09:58.932 --> 10:01.702
Thank you. Okay.
While Carly is still here--

10:01.735 --> 10:04.271
- One minute, 45 seconds to go.

10:04.304 --> 10:05.939
- Years ago I created
a sculpture

10:05.973 --> 10:07.607
with the most moving parts,

10:07.641 --> 10:11.111
unwittingly breaking
a Jonas World Record.

10:11.144 --> 10:16.349
I've since lost that title,
but tonight I shall reclaim it.

10:16.383 --> 10:20.053
Behold, the "Supertastic
Sculpture of Stuff..."

10:20.087 --> 10:21.922
[bell rings]

10:21.955 --> 10:23.023
"Plus."

10:23.056 --> 10:26.026
[applause]

10:26.059 --> 10:28.829
- Impressive. Is it different
from the old one?

10:28.862 --> 10:33.767
- No. It is the old one,
just with more stuff.

10:33.801 --> 10:36.636
Hence the plus.

10:36.670 --> 10:40.340
- I'm not unamused.
- I'm full-on amused.

10:40.373 --> 10:43.143
- Are we all looking
at the same thing?

10:43.176 --> 10:45.278
That big, old pile of junk?

10:45.312 --> 10:46.780
- It's art.

10:46.814 --> 10:49.883
Not everyone has to like it.
Why don't you like it?

10:49.917 --> 10:52.152
- It's just the same thing
you did before

10:52.185 --> 10:54.988
with a few new pieces, right?

10:55.022 --> 10:58.959
- Will somebody put down
their gold drink and defend me?

10:58.992 --> 11:00.593
- I will.

11:00.627 --> 11:03.396
The reason this is genius is--
[phone ringing]

11:03.430 --> 11:05.766
And I'm out.
Night, guys.

11:05.799 --> 11:08.301
- Freddie, finish her thought,
please.

11:08.335 --> 11:11.571
- Okay.
Um.

11:11.604 --> 11:14.674
- Carly? Carly Shay
from Camp Lakehorn?

11:14.708 --> 11:19.646
- Luke? Luke Tyler
also from Camp Lakehorn?

11:19.679 --> 11:21.548
- Are you leaving?
- No.

11:21.581 --> 11:24.885
I'm just holding the door
for your girlfriend.

11:24.918 --> 11:26.954
- I'm single.

11:26.987 --> 11:28.756
- Oh, my God.
We have so much in common.

11:35.662 --> 11:37.865
- I can't believe we found
each other again.

11:37.898 --> 11:39.466
I just want to know
everything about you.

11:39.499 --> 11:41.101
What does your dad do?

11:41.134 --> 11:45.338
- Well, he's in the Air Force
but was somehow on a submarine.

11:45.372 --> 11:50.610
And I'm not exactly sure.

11:50.643 --> 11:56.349
- Okay. What's your mom like?
- Uh--I--

11:56.383 --> 11:58.618
let's go back to my dad.

11:58.651 --> 12:02.189
- So you hot-glued a bunch
of random stuff on there

12:02.222 --> 12:05.125
to keep a plaque,
then threw yourself a party?

12:05.158 --> 12:09.096
- It's not a plaque.
It's a certificate.

12:09.129 --> 12:12.900
I need to eat my feelings.

12:12.933 --> 12:17.104
Not a waiter?

12:17.137 --> 12:19.506
- When I got back from Italy,
I went to college.

12:19.539 --> 12:21.975
I tried theater
and media studies,

12:22.009 --> 12:24.177
but I felt like I got more out
of doing "iCarly"

12:24.211 --> 12:27.614
then at any boring old lecture.
So what do you do?

12:27.647 --> 12:30.050
- I'm a college professor.

12:30.083 --> 12:33.086
- But I bet whatever you teach
is super meaningful.

12:33.120 --> 12:37.324
- I specialize in the mouthfeel
of certain viscous foods.

12:37.357 --> 12:39.927
- Yep, super meaningful.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.295
- Trust me, I am in
no place to date.

12:42.329 --> 12:46.233
- See, just that self-awareness
tells me you totally are.

12:46.266 --> 12:49.903
- They're out of spicy tuna
cones, so I'm going to dip.

12:52.105 --> 12:55.042
- That's my stepdaughter.
I share custody with my ex,

12:55.075 --> 12:58.145
who divorced me
and took all my nice shirts.

12:59.279 --> 13:02.249
[cheers and applause]

13:02.282 --> 13:03.750
- Oh, there you are.

13:03.783 --> 13:06.820
Millicent, I drew your bath,
and, Freddie--Freddie!

13:06.854 --> 13:09.722
I put your warm milk in
your Thermos next to your bed.

13:09.756 --> 13:11.391
And if you're both good,
I'll let you snuggle with me

13:11.424 --> 13:14.895
for ten minutes
and watch "Toledo House Flip."

13:14.928 --> 13:19.199
- Oh, my gosh. Come on,
Freddie, "Toledo House Flip."

13:20.834 --> 13:25.305
- So are we done here?
Great. Thank you.

13:25.338 --> 13:28.808
- Luke, I don't normally do
this on the first night,

13:28.842 --> 13:33.680
but should we go somewhere
a little more comfortable?

13:35.916 --> 13:39.086
I hope you still
respect me after this.

13:39.119 --> 13:41.254
Okay. So in the criminal
justice system,

13:41.288 --> 13:42.722
the people are represented

13:42.755 --> 13:45.893
by two separate yet equally
important groups, right?

13:45.926 --> 13:48.261
There's the police,
who investigate crime,

13:48.295 --> 13:52.565
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

13:52.599 --> 13:54.334
These are their stories.

13:54.367 --> 13:57.337
[upbeat music]

13:57.370 --> 14:00.307
*

14:00.340 --> 14:02.242
- Carly, is that you?

14:02.275 --> 14:04.711
You're normally catatonic
until noon,

14:04.744 --> 14:07.014
when you gather enough energy
to cry.

14:07.047 --> 14:08.381
- It's me.

14:08.415 --> 14:12.352
Help yourself to a mimosa.
Pancakes are on the way.

14:12.385 --> 14:15.088
- You made breakfast,
you showered, you're happy.

14:15.122 --> 14:17.190
I'm thrilled.
What's happening?

14:17.224 --> 14:20.760
- [mouths words]
- Fate. Fate is happening.

14:20.793 --> 14:22.495
Did you know
I was about to leave,

14:22.529 --> 14:23.964
I set a timer,
it went off

14:23.997 --> 14:27.767
I opened the door
and there he was, Luke.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.236
- No.
Ugh.

14:29.269 --> 14:30.938
You were texting
in the group chat until,

14:30.971 --> 14:32.472
like, 3:00 a.m. last night.

14:32.505 --> 14:36.176
I swore I would never mute
my bestie, but you tested me.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.380
- Why does it look
so nice in here?

14:40.413 --> 14:43.951
- I'm just so happy about
reconnecting with Luke.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.986
Did you know
I was about to leave?

14:46.019 --> 14:48.521
together: I set a timer
and when it went off,

14:48.555 --> 14:51.191
I opened the door
and there he was,

14:51.224 --> 14:53.726
Luke.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.195
- Millicent doesn't know
the story.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.697
- Don't care.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.866
- Fine. I set a timer,
then it went off.

14:59.899 --> 15:03.736
I opened the door
and there he was, Luke.

15:03.770 --> 15:05.305
- Wait a minute.

15:05.338 --> 15:08.308
Why is there a framed picture
of Luke on that table?

15:08.341 --> 15:10.010
- Oh, it's just from
his Instagram.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.344
It's totally normal.

15:11.378 --> 15:13.813
- Flowers, the pancakes.

15:13.846 --> 15:19.119
- The showering.
This is too nice for us.

15:19.152 --> 15:20.320
- What?

15:20.353 --> 15:23.190
I can't do something nice
for my friends

15:23.223 --> 15:24.891
and Beau to prove
that I won the break-up?

15:24.924 --> 15:26.326
[all gasp]

15:26.359 --> 15:27.394
[doorbell rings]

15:27.427 --> 15:29.562
- What have you done?

15:29.596 --> 15:33.500
- I figured since I'm so happy
and in such a good place,

15:33.533 --> 15:37.370
it's the perfect time
to reach out to Beau.

15:37.404 --> 15:42.542
- Carly. Carly, Carly, Carly
and friends.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.877
Friends, friends, friends.

15:44.911 --> 15:48.681
So excited for brunch,
but first,

15:48.715 --> 15:51.184
Carly, can we talk a sec?

15:51.218 --> 15:52.352
- I'll get the water.
- You got that oatmeal?

15:52.385 --> 15:54.254
- I'm going to
read the newspaper.

15:55.088 --> 15:57.424
- Thanks for having me over.
I'm glad we can catch up

15:57.457 --> 16:01.728
because I wanted you
to hear it from me first.

16:01.761 --> 16:04.397
I'm seeing someone.
[all gasp]

16:04.431 --> 16:05.565
- We doing eggs?
- Current events.

16:05.598 --> 16:08.935
- So creamy.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.470
- Good for you, Beau.

16:10.503 --> 16:13.740
- And we're doing
a new channel together.

16:13.773 --> 16:16.143
[all gasp]
- What?

16:16.176 --> 16:21.148
- Well, I'm dating someone too.
Luke. We have history.

16:21.181 --> 16:24.784
He's a professor, so our
connection is really cerebral

16:24.817 --> 16:27.654
but also physical
and emotional.

16:27.687 --> 16:29.656
All the connections
you can have with a person,

16:29.689 --> 16:32.192
we have, plus more.

16:32.225 --> 16:34.761
This is his face.
- That's awesome.

16:34.794 --> 16:39.266
- It is, and we're starting
a channel together too.

16:39.299 --> 16:41.134
- What?
- Wow.

16:41.168 --> 16:45.238
- This is goat milk!
- We don't even get the paper.

16:45.272 --> 16:48.275
- You know, because comedy
and mouthfeel science

16:48.308 --> 16:50.510
are such a natural fit.

16:50.543 --> 16:53.580
- Sure. Sure. When are going
to drop your first video?

16:53.613 --> 16:56.183
- Uh, Friday.

16:56.216 --> 16:59.086
- Wow.
We're dropping Friday too.

16:59.119 --> 17:01.288
- And we're launching live.

17:01.321 --> 17:04.657
- Premiere live?
That's crazy risky.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.359
Look at you.

17:06.393 --> 17:07.760
I got to run to the bathroom,

17:07.794 --> 17:11.064
but then I want to hear
all about this channel.

17:17.104 --> 17:19.372
- Oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God.

17:19.406 --> 17:21.040
Why did I just say
I'm launching a channel

17:21.074 --> 17:22.342
with a total stranger?

17:22.375 --> 17:23.843
- Now wait a minute.

17:23.876 --> 17:27.914
Y'all went to camp.
You two made s'mores.

17:27.947 --> 17:30.517
- Right.
We have that.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.685
You know what?
This is going to totally work.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.287
Luke and I
are going to kill it.

17:34.321 --> 17:35.588
- You will?
- Really?

17:35.622 --> 17:37.023
- Luke?

17:37.056 --> 17:37.990
- You will.
- Really!

17:38.024 --> 17:39.759
- Luke!

17:45.698 --> 17:46.999
- I love this place.

17:47.033 --> 17:49.636
- Just a heads up,
they only serve whey here.

17:49.669 --> 17:52.905
- Like, whey protein that
you put in a smoothie?

17:52.939 --> 17:55.007
- No, like the watery part
of milk

17:55.041 --> 17:57.877
that remains
after the formation of curds.

17:57.910 --> 18:01.981
Divine mouthfeel.

18:02.014 --> 18:05.652
- Do all these people know
this?

18:05.685 --> 18:07.220
So I have something
really exciting to tell you--

18:07.254 --> 18:12.425
- Mm, mm, mm!
Classic Seattle tap.

18:12.459 --> 18:15.195
That slightly unctuous texture.

18:18.331 --> 18:21.201
- Very wet.
- Mm-hmm.

18:21.234 --> 18:22.369
- And so I was going to tell
you that--

18:22.402 --> 18:24.237
- Here is our Bavarian goat
whey,

18:24.271 --> 18:28.975
fermented at an altitude
of just under 10,000 feet.

18:29.008 --> 18:31.478
Enjoy.

18:32.345 --> 18:34.781
- If you get a chunk,
that's considered good luck.

18:34.814 --> 18:36.683
Bottoms up.

18:40.753 --> 18:43.956
[Luke moaning]

18:43.990 --> 18:46.793
- Guess I got lucky.
[chuckles]

18:46.826 --> 18:48.161
So the thing I was
going to tell you--

18:48.195 --> 18:53.533
- [gargling]

18:54.901 --> 18:56.836
- I'll wait.

18:56.869 --> 19:00.240
- [gargling]

19:00.273 --> 19:02.141
- Yeah. We're done.

19:02.175 --> 19:04.611
[upbeat music]

19:04.644 --> 19:06.479
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes.

19:06.513 --> 19:09.282
Okay.
Which one of these things

19:09.316 --> 19:12.585
can I add to the sculpture
to make you like it?

19:12.619 --> 19:15.054
- Spencer, that's not
what this is--

19:15.087 --> 19:16.756
are those my sunglasses?

19:16.789 --> 19:20.126
- Maybe, or maybe they're art.
- Oh, come on.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.494
Who cares what I think?

19:21.528 --> 19:24.864
- Me! Me cares.
- But why does "me" care?

19:24.897 --> 19:26.766
Look, just because
I'm young, cool

19:26.799 --> 19:28.968
and probably the hottest person
you'll ever meet in real life?

19:29.001 --> 19:31.804
- Yeah, all those.
- When you made the sculpture,

19:31.838 --> 19:34.807
you were inspired,
and you loved it.

19:34.841 --> 19:37.344
That's all that matters.

19:37.377 --> 19:39.246
- I'll buy you a car
if you say you like it.

19:39.279 --> 19:42.114
- You are lucky
I do not have parking.

19:42.148 --> 19:44.284
*

19:45.151 --> 19:46.419
- I needed this.

19:46.453 --> 19:48.321
I had discarded dairy juice
for dinner.

19:48.355 --> 19:51.090
- No way.
- Yes, whey.

19:51.123 --> 19:53.660
Why did I ever think I should
start a channel with Luke?

19:53.693 --> 19:55.495
Am I that desperate
for a partner?

19:55.528 --> 19:57.964
Don't answer that,
still talking.

19:57.997 --> 19:59.232
[sighs]

19:59.266 --> 20:00.667
I just want
to make things again.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.869
- You don't need a partner
to do that.

20:02.902 --> 20:06.038
- Yeah. I don't need a partner.
I need Sam,

20:06.072 --> 20:08.941
but she's off following
her bliss with that biker gang.

20:08.975 --> 20:12.345
- The Obliteraters.
I hope she's okay.

20:12.379 --> 20:16.015
- It's Sam.
I hope they're okay.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.885
I just wish she was here
so we could do "iCarly" again.

20:18.918 --> 20:20.587
- Mm.

20:22.422 --> 20:24.591
Do you think
I could do it on my own?

20:24.624 --> 20:27.159
- Doesn't matter what I think.
It matters what you want.

20:27.193 --> 20:30.830
- Of course, I wouldn't be
completely on my own.

20:30.863 --> 20:32.299
I'd have my new producer.

20:32.332 --> 20:36.469
- Aw. You do mean me, right?
- Yeah.

20:36.503 --> 20:37.870
Do you think you could shoot me

20:37.904 --> 20:41.841
using that filter
that makes my cheekbones all--

20:41.874 --> 20:43.776
- That filter that makes you
look like an alien?

20:43.810 --> 20:46.479
- A sexy alien.

20:46.513 --> 20:50.583
- Sure. I guess there's
just one more question.

20:50.617 --> 20:53.586
- If Spencer ever got around
to building that home gym.

21:00.727 --> 21:03.763
- I was never going to use
a home gym.

21:06.533 --> 21:10.136
- Ah!
- Oh, that's right.

21:10.169 --> 21:12.605
I forgot about
my marionette-making phase.

21:12.639 --> 21:16.376
I keep them up here because
it's away from the knives.

21:16.409 --> 21:18.878
- Mm, why does that one
look like Carly?

21:18.911 --> 21:20.580
- I made one that looks
like you too, Freddie,

21:20.613 --> 21:25.251
but I sold it to Nora Dershlit.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.919
- Is this a good idea?

21:26.953 --> 21:28.855
I mean, what would I even do
on the show?

21:28.888 --> 21:32.158
Old, goofy stuff,
new, sophisticated stuff?

21:32.191 --> 21:36.396
- Just find something that
makes you smile. Go from there.

21:36.429 --> 21:39.065
- Those dachshunds
always made me smile.

21:39.098 --> 21:40.367
Who put those up there?

21:40.400 --> 21:42.435
- I've never seen those before
in my life.

21:46.305 --> 21:49.876
- Aw.
The idiot farm girl.

21:49.909 --> 21:53.813
You know what? This really
does look like a squirrel.

21:53.846 --> 21:58.117
Oh, my God. The sack.
These were so fun.

21:58.150 --> 22:01.120
- Yeah, until Sam superglued
my drawstring closed

22:01.153 --> 22:02.989
and left me here overnight.

22:03.022 --> 22:04.724
- Yeah. That was a rough night
for me too.

22:04.757 --> 22:07.960
He would not stop screaming.

22:07.994 --> 22:11.364
- George, the bra
that told ghost stories.

22:11.398 --> 22:14.567
I never did grow into you.

22:14.601 --> 22:17.370
- See, you came up with all
this stuff when you were a kid.

22:17.404 --> 22:18.938
Imagine what you can do now.

22:18.971 --> 22:21.374
- And we'll help however we
can.

22:21.408 --> 22:27.614
- I'm really glad to hear
you say that because...

22:27.647 --> 22:30.783
I thought
it might still be here.

22:30.817 --> 22:34.421
- Damn it.
- [chuckles]

22:34.454 --> 22:36.055
- We're back.

22:36.088 --> 22:39.659
- In five, four,

22:39.692 --> 22:42.361
three, two--

22:42.395 --> 22:45.765
- Welcome to the new "iCarly."

22:45.798 --> 22:47.900
- Ooh, looks like she's already
got a few viewers.

22:47.934 --> 22:50.870
- Probably bots from Brazil.

22:50.903 --> 22:54.140
- This is still "iCarly,"
but it's grown-up now.

22:54.173 --> 22:56.776
So today I thought I'd share
my skin-care routine.

22:56.809 --> 22:59.579
According to the many,
many targeted ads I get,

22:59.612 --> 23:03.182
it's never too early
to start using...

23:03.215 --> 23:06.285
anti-aging products!

23:06.318 --> 23:09.689
Even for Baby Spencer.

23:09.722 --> 23:13.025
- Yeah! That's me!

23:13.059 --> 23:15.695
- None of these products
were tested on animals,

23:15.728 --> 23:18.264
just one tiny,
little lucky infant.

23:18.297 --> 23:22.368
- Oh, I feel lucky!
In no way am I worried.

23:22.401 --> 23:24.637
- [laughs]

23:24.671 --> 23:27.940
- Here we go.
- Oh.

23:27.974 --> 23:29.709
- Oh, I think he needs
a lot more.

23:29.742 --> 23:32.979
- Some more?
- No. That's enough already.

23:33.012 --> 23:34.681
[shouts]

23:34.714 --> 23:37.550
I don't think
this is how you do it.

23:37.584 --> 23:39.118
- I love this serum.

23:39.151 --> 23:41.153
I actually panic-bought it
when I was at a 7-Eleven,

23:41.187 --> 23:43.122
and the guy there
called me ma'am.

23:43.155 --> 23:44.724
- I don't know
what he's so upset about.

23:44.757 --> 23:47.293
I pay people to do this to me.

23:47.326 --> 23:49.428
- They say that by the time
you need skin care,

23:49.462 --> 23:50.863
it's already too late,

23:50.897 --> 23:52.431
but you should still spend
all your money on it.

23:52.465 --> 23:55.034
And in the end, it's just
an expensive reminder

23:55.067 --> 23:57.236
we're all going to die someday.

23:57.269 --> 24:01.974
- That's a little emo for
a comedy show, don't you think?

24:02.008 --> 24:03.242
- Sheet mask.
- What?

24:03.275 --> 24:07.146
- Yup. Here you go.
- Ah! No!

24:07.179 --> 24:08.981
- People are weirdly loving
this.

24:09.015 --> 24:11.283
- I'm totally hating it!

24:11.317 --> 24:14.253
- Enough of that, baby.
And now we're just going to...

24:14.286 --> 24:15.555
- That's cold.

24:15.588 --> 24:17.023
- Roll it all up.
- I don't like that feeling.

24:17.056 --> 24:18.858
- And we're going to absorb...
- Ow.

24:18.891 --> 24:21.528
- All the moisturizer.
- It's cold.

24:21.561 --> 24:22.829
- You ready for the lip mask?

24:22.862 --> 24:25.031
- Oh, I don't know what it is,
but I am.

24:25.064 --> 24:26.799
- Right here.
- Okay.

24:26.833 --> 24:30.402
- Okay. You're going to want to
keep your mouth nice and shut.

24:30.436 --> 24:31.971
- That sounds good.

24:32.004 --> 24:34.106
- This lip mask is actually
made out of laundry detergent.

24:34.140 --> 24:35.307
- [sputters and shouts]

24:35.341 --> 24:37.844
- Kinda of seems like
we never left.

24:37.877 --> 24:40.680
[upbeat music]

24:40.713 --> 24:43.182
- A toast to my sister, Carly.

24:43.215 --> 24:45.251
- To Carly.
- To Carly.

24:45.284 --> 24:49.088
- Also I decided not to call
the Jonas people.

24:49.121 --> 24:51.323
Let someone else
have the world record.

24:51.357 --> 24:52.925
It's not why I made
the sculpture,

24:52.959 --> 24:55.928
and it's not why I love it.

24:55.962 --> 24:58.898
- Still not for me.
- Damn it.

24:58.931 --> 25:00.867
- I think the sculpture
is great.

25:00.900 --> 25:02.034
Do all the pieces still move?

25:02.068 --> 25:04.270
- You tell me.

25:04.303 --> 25:05.371
[whirring]

25:05.404 --> 25:06.639
[clattering]

25:06.673 --> 25:08.474
[electricity crackles]

25:14.013 --> 25:18.818
- I--I love it.

25:18.851 --> 25:21.420
- You do?
- Absolutely.

25:21.453 --> 25:24.056
It's about setting
your own self on fire

25:24.090 --> 25:28.861
and then rebuilding
from the ashes like a phoenix.

25:28.895 --> 25:31.564
- If you want to
oversimplify it, sure.

25:31.598 --> 25:33.032
- You know,
you really had me going

25:33.065 --> 25:34.967
with the whole world record
thing,

25:35.001 --> 25:37.003
but I guess
that was just a part of it.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.470
Performance art.

25:38.504 --> 25:41.440
[flames crackling]

25:45.044 --> 25:48.447
- It wasn't supposed
to catch on fire, was it?

25:48.480 --> 25:50.449
- Never is.
