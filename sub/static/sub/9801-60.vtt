just, are you sure it was me?

-He's lose!

09:29.010 --> 09:31.010
Run for your lives.

09:31.010 --> 09:32.480
Ah!

09:32.480 --> 09:33.790
-Please, no!

09:33.790 --> 09:35.430
Listen to me, I beg you.

09:35.430 --> 09:37.250
I'm not a bad guy!

09:37.250 --> 09:39.060
It's all been one
horrible misunderstanding.

09:41.770 --> 09:43.770
-I was going to say
something clever here.

09:43.770 --> 09:46.590
But really, that's not who I am.

09:46.590 --> 09:49.850
All I want to do is smush you.

09:49.850 --> 09:51.840
-Ah!

09:51.840 --> 09:52.960
-At ease, soldier.

09:52.960 --> 09:53.940
Your backup is here.

09:56.320 --> 09:57.020
-Look!

09:57.020 --> 09:59.190
The next-O skeleton,
it's working!

09:59.190 --> 10:01.500
It's w--

10:01.500 --> 10:02.450
-Sorry.

10:02.450 --> 10:04.850
I was aiming for
jerky stompy feet.

10:04.850 --> 10:06.290
Still getting the hang of this.

10:11.950 --> 10:12.650
-Ah!

10:15.910 --> 10:17.660
-One mistake, little Dale.

10:17.660 --> 10:20.310
We are like the
Three Musketeers,

10:20.310 --> 10:22.130
except there are four of us.

10:22.130 --> 10:25.620
And we're birds, and
in no way French.

10:25.620 --> 10:28.490
But the same team
mentality applies.

10:28.490 --> 10:30.860
-Couldn't care less.

10:30.860 --> 10:33.110
-Ah!

10:33.110 --> 10:35.420
-Rico, increase
his sodium intake.

10:35.420 --> 10:36.540
-Blah.

10:36.540 --> 10:38.150
-Back off, gastropod.

10:38.150 --> 10:42.390
I've got a salt shaker,
and I'm not afraid to-- oh.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.310
-Oh dear, oh dear.

10:46.310 --> 10:47.920
Ah!

10:47.920 --> 10:50.270
-Look, I know it's obvious.

10:50.270 --> 10:54.160
But I want to underline the
poetic justice here anyway.

10:54.160 --> 10:59.390
I'm going to step on you
just like you stepped on me

10:59.390 --> 11:02.910
wearing your very
own robo clothes.

11:02.910 --> 11:03.610
-Ah!

11:03.610 --> 11:06.480
I suppose that's fair after
how I've wronged you so.

11:06.480 --> 11:09.290
But just so you know,
that's not my suit.

11:09.290 --> 11:10.580
-It's not?

11:10.580 --> 11:11.660
-No, it's Kowalski's.

11:11.660 --> 11:14.240
-Wait a second, aren't you
the science guy penguin?

11:14.240 --> 11:17.850
-No, I'm the adorable, nice guy
with a heart of gold penguin.

11:17.850 --> 11:20.820
-So who stepped
on me last spring?

11:20.820 --> 11:23.420
-I am proud to
introduce the next phase

11:23.420 --> 11:28.070
of penguin combat,
the Nexto Skeleton.

11:28.070 --> 11:29.390
[LAUGHING]

11:29.390 --> 11:30.440
How about that?

11:30.440 --> 11:31.140
-You see?

11:31.140 --> 11:34.420
This whole thing's just been
one big misunderstanding.

11:34.420 --> 11:36.170
-I don't know what
to say Private.

11:36.170 --> 11:40.460
-Just say we'll be friends,
and we'll forget all about it.

11:40.460 --> 11:41.840
-I'll do more than that.

11:41.840 --> 11:43.610
I'll set the record straight.

11:43.610 --> 11:47.190
I'll tell everyone that you
really are a stand up guy.

11:47.190 --> 11:48.190
-Thanks Dale.

11:48.190 --> 11:52.310
-Just as soon as I stop this
Kowalski jerk into the ground!

11:52.310 --> 11:54.850
Dance penguin, dance!

11:54.850 --> 11:55.540
-Ah!

11:55.540 --> 11:56.530
Help me!

12:09.450 --> 12:10.150
-Ow!

12:10.150 --> 12:10.960

Mort!

12:11.660 --> 12:12.570
Come quickly!

12:12.570 --> 12:15.060
This crickey tickey
drone has preciously

12:15.060 --> 12:19.530
attacked my magnificent royal
booty with this stabbiness.

12:19.530 --> 12:21.330
-It's just a splinter.

12:21.330 --> 12:23.460
-A teeny, tiny, teeny splinter.

12:23.460 --> 12:26.690
-It is attempted booty-cide.

12:26.690 --> 12:27.590
Spread the word.

12:27.590 --> 12:30.520
Your king is needing
a brand new throne.

12:44.220 --> 12:46.780
-Kowalski, make a note
of that for inventory.

12:46.780 --> 12:49.170
How's that pepper count coming?

12:49.170 --> 12:51.940
-Ah, ah, achoo!

12:51.940 --> 12:52.820
-You done?

12:52.820 --> 12:54.090

13:05.620 --> 13:07.240
-I'm afraid so, Skipper.

13:07.240 --> 13:11.340
-It's S-T-A-N-K, STANK!

13:11.340 --> 13:15.760
-After all these years,
I try so hard to forget.

13:15.760 --> 13:16.460
-Right.

13:16.460 --> 13:18.840
So what's a stank?

It was, it was a horrible--

13:26.320 --> 13:27.020
-Acronym?

13:27.020 --> 13:29.000
-A stink bomb, Private.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.700
-The acronym's not
very good either.

13:30.700 --> 13:34.110
-But not just any stink
bomb, the grand mama

13:34.110 --> 13:38.410
stink bomb to end
all stink bombs.

13:38.410 --> 13:40.920
It was designed to
lock onto a target

13:40.920 --> 13:44.520
and hold it there until
the odour core detonated.

13:44.520 --> 13:47.540
-Private, putrid
perfume of project STANK

13:47.540 --> 13:51.200
is a bazillion times worse than
anything you've ever smelled.

13:51.200 --> 13:54.270
-Bazillion isn't a
real number, Skipper.

13:54.270 --> 13:54.970
-Is too.

13:54.970 --> 13:57.570
The International Numbers
Council just declared it.

13:57.570 --> 13:59.230
-And that is not a real council.

13:59.230 --> 14:00.420
-Huh, is too!

14:00.420 --> 14:03.310
The International Council's
Council just declared it.

14:03.310 --> 14:06.400
Just now.

14:06.400 --> 14:09.720
-So who was STANK supposed
to lure into its foul seat?

14:09.720 --> 14:11.600
-Dr. Blow Hole.

14:11.600 --> 14:14.330
-And that's where the
whole project went wrong.

14:14.330 --> 14:16.090
Turns out dolphins
don't use toilets.

14:16.090 --> 14:16.790
-Nope.

-Not when they've got

I'm never swimming
in the ocean again.

14:28.430 --> 14:30.660

14:38.370 --> 14:39.070
-Apparently.

14:39.070 --> 14:41.190
But we should be
safe, as long as we

14:41.190 --> 14:43.460
don't disturb its fragile core.

-Ah.

15:05.450 --> 15:07.310
-Gently, Rico.

15:07.310 --> 15:10.690
The tiniest movement could
initiate the detonation timer.

-You're not the one with
the doomsday STANK bomb

18:59.330 --> 19:01.420
strapped to your booty!

19:01.420 --> 19:02.420
-Can I drive?

19:02.420 --> 19:04.120
-No!

19:04.120 --> 19:05.920
-Can I drive now?

19:05.920 --> 19:08.000
-Uh-uh.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.470
-How about now?

19:09.470 --> 19:10.450
-No!

19:10.450 --> 19:11.430
Uh--

19:11.430 --> 19:12.410
-I try!

19:15.840 --> 19:16.820
-Ah--

19:16.820 --> 19:19.060
-Ah--

19:19.060 --> 19:19.760
-Oh, OK.

19:19.760 --> 19:21.150
That's enough driving for me.

19:21.150 --> 19:22.490
Your turn.

19:22.490 --> 19:23.390
[ALARM]

19:23.390 --> 19:25.160
-We got lucky, ringtail.

19:25.160 --> 19:26.720
Real lucky.

19:26.720 --> 19:28.910
[TRAIN]

19:28.910 --> 19:30.570
-Ah!

19:30.570 --> 19:33.400
-These locking mechanisms are
identical to the one strapped

19:33.400 --> 19:35.330
onto King Julien's
posterior regions.

19:35.330 --> 19:37.850
-So if we can find the right
liquid solution to short

19:37.850 --> 19:39.270
out the circuit,
we can free him.

19:39.270 --> 19:42.240
-Well, let's get started.

19:42.240 --> 19:43.200
-Ah!

19:43.200 --> 19:44.200
-Oh, boy.

19:44.200 --> 19:45.160
[TRAIN]

19:45.160 --> 19:46.850
[CRYING]

19:46.850 --> 19:47.550
-Why?

20:03.030 --> 20:06.850
-Good work, Rico.

20:06.850 --> 20:10.260
Look ringtail,
sweet, sweet Jersey.

20:10.260 --> 20:13.600
Now, we just need some answers
from the geniuses in the lab.

20:13.600 --> 20:14.430
-It's not going to work--

20:14.430 --> 20:15.130
-OK.

20:15.130 --> 20:17.250
How are we supposed-- hey!

20:17.250 --> 20:19.170
-This is kind of
awkward, isn't it?

20:23.640 --> 20:25.170
[ALARM]

20:27.980 --> 20:28.680
-Hey, look.

20:28.680 --> 20:29.380
It worked!

20:29.380 --> 20:30.360
-What worked?

20:30.360 --> 20:32.870
I'm using the same solution,
and nothing is happening.

20:32.870 --> 20:35.410
-Kowalski, tell me
you've got good news.

20:35.410 --> 20:36.820
-Well, something must
have been different.

20:36.820 --> 20:39.330
Because I'm standing over here,
and you're standing over there.

20:39.330 --> 20:43.390
-What could possibly
be different?

20:43.390 --> 20:50.630
Unless it's 678,435 grains
of recently spilled salt.

20:50.630 --> 20:52.840
Skipper, the answer
is sodium chloride!

20:52.840 --> 20:54.770
SKIPPER (ON RADIO): Hey, know
how you don't speak trucker?

20:54.770 --> 20:56.880
Well, I don't speak nerdese.

20:56.880 --> 20:57.640
-Salt.

20:57.640 --> 21:01.500
You need common table salt to
short out the lock, good buddy.

21:01.500 --> 21:04.730
-Kowalski, we're in a city
dump, not restaurant row.

21:04.730 --> 21:05.890
-Salt water would
work, but they'd

21:05.890 --> 21:07.530
never get to the shore in time.

21:07.530 --> 21:08.330
Oh, wait.

21:08.330 --> 21:09.230
Saline!

21:09.230 --> 21:10.710
Do either of you
wear contact lenses?

21:10.710 --> 21:11.520
-I got it!

21:11.520 --> 21:12.680
Tears are salty.

21:12.680 --> 21:13.510
Cry onto the lock.

21:13.510 --> 21:16.100
Cry like you're going to die,
because if you don't, you

21:16.100 --> 21:17.140
might.

21:17.140 --> 21:18.320
-You heard him, ringtail.

21:18.320 --> 21:19.490
Make with the water works.

21:19.490 --> 21:20.220
-What?

21:20.220 --> 21:20.920
Oh, OK.

21:20.920 --> 21:21.840
Yeah, I'll try.

21:21.840 --> 21:22.690
-You'll try?

21:22.690 --> 21:25.180
You've been crying
nonstop for the last hour.

21:25.180 --> 21:26.010
Now, come on.

21:26.010 --> 21:28.630
Squeeze out a couple of tears.

21:28.630 --> 21:30.140
[ALARM]

21:31.850 --> 21:39.120
-Let me give it a-- ah--
e-- eh-- I can't do it!

21:39.120 --> 21:39.920
I can't just fake it.

21:39.920 --> 21:42.590
It needs to be real,
from the inside.

21:42.590 --> 21:45.820
-Well, uh, think of sentimental
things- good times you had

21:45.820 --> 21:47.140
with, uh, dear friends.

21:47.140 --> 21:48.910
-Puh, what friends?

21:48.910 --> 21:49.930
To you?

21:49.930 --> 21:50.630
-Yes.

21:50.630 --> 21:51.440
OK, sure.

21:51.440 --> 21:54.060
If that works for you,
think of us, uh, together.

22:01.740 --> 22:03.450
My god, they're
stock short pants.

22:03.450 --> 22:07.100
I can't believe how much
time I've wasted with you.

22:13.380 --> 22:14.210
-Aha!

22:14.210 --> 22:14.910
I am free!

22:14.910 --> 22:17.650
I am free from my
throne of STANK!

22:22.010 --> 22:24.210
-We'll never clear the
stanturaneous in time.

22:24.210 --> 22:25.620
PRIVATE: Oh, yes we will.

22:29.440 --> 22:31.350
[ALARM]

22:36.150 --> 22:38.520
-My calculations show
that STANK might actually

22:38.520 --> 22:40.760
improve the air quality
over New Jersey.

22:40.760 --> 22:41.870
-Huh.

22:41.870 --> 22:45.600
I am just glad you broke
down and cried girly tears

22:45.600 --> 22:48.360
at the thought of
never seeing me again.

22:48.360 --> 22:50.210
-Now, hold on a
minute, ringtail.

22:50.210 --> 22:53.900
It was one very small,
very manly tear.

22:53.900 --> 22:56.460
-Big, blubbery baby.

22:56.460 --> 22:57.660
Woo-hoo.

22:57.660 --> 22:59.210
-Uh.
