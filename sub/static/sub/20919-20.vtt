[Iron Man narrating] An alien named
the Beyonder took pieces of worlds,

00:05.731 --> 00:07.989
then mashed them together
to build Battleworld.

00:08.067 --> 00:10.545
[Captain America narrating] The people
from those places, including the Avengers,

00:10.568 --> 00:12.085
were brought to this world.

00:12.162 --> 00:14.162
The Beyonder calls this
his experiment.

00:14.240 --> 00:15.739
We call it twisted
and dangerous.

00:15.741 --> 00:19.834
Now with Loki on our side,
we're rebuilding a new Bifrost

00:19.912 --> 00:24.581
so we can undo Battleworld and the Beyonder's
experiment and send everyone home.

00:24.583 --> 00:27.342
What we need next is Vibranium,

00:27.419 --> 00:28.654
an element even rarer here
than back on Earth.

00:28.678 --> 00:31.421
And we're gonna
need a lot of it.

00:31.423 --> 00:34.516
Thieves have been rumored to be
selling Vibranium in the west.

00:34.593 --> 00:38.428
So to catch a thief,
we're sending our former thief,

00:38.430 --> 00:40.264
the best man for the job.
[snoring]

00:40.266 --> 00:44.192
I know it's super important
that we get back home to Earth,

00:44.270 --> 00:46.378
but can we please
take a moment to acknowledge

00:46.455 --> 00:50.957
just how awesome Battleworld is?
[snoring continues]

00:51.034 --> 00:53.277
Huh? Huh? Well, yeah, if by awesome,
you mean, I'm awesomely terrified

00:53.279 --> 00:56.871
that the Avengers are counting
on me not to screw up, then yes.

00:56.949 --> 01:00.634
You know, I'm not even sure
if Battleworld has ants.

01:00.710 --> 01:02.786
Mm. Now I'm all bummed out.
[monitor beeping]

01:02.788 --> 01:05.471
Ant-Man, we got something.
Over there!

01:05.549 --> 01:10.903
O.M.G.! It's Atlantis!
Or Monster Island.

01:10.979 --> 01:13.555
I know you've been before,
but I'm just dying to...

01:13.632 --> 01:15.132
Whoa, Ms. Marvel. Hold up.

01:15.134 --> 01:17.801
Is that...

01:17.803 --> 01:19.244
A pirate ship?
[grunts] [loud blast]

01:21.974 --> 01:24.157
[both yell] [alarm blaring]

01:24.234 --> 01:25.475

Don't worry! I got this!

01:44.330 --> 01:45.753
[both grunt]

01:45.831 --> 01:46.847
Huh?

01:53.339 --> 01:57.023
My, my. What have we here?

01:57.100 --> 01:59.359
A couple of stowaways.

01:59.436 --> 02:01.120
[Ms. Marvel] Typhoid Mary.

02:01.196 --> 02:02.937
[Ant-Man] Ugh! Typhoid Mary?
[screeches]

02:03.015 --> 02:06.941
[chittering] Hey! That's mine!

02:07.019 --> 02:09.627
We're not stowaways.
You shot us out of the sky!

02:09.705 --> 02:11.296
Mm, no, I didn't.

02:11.373 --> 02:13.281
Yes, you did!

02:13.359 --> 02:17.803
I think I'd remember doing that.
Oh, goody! This'll be fun.

02:17.880 --> 02:20.305
You know what we do
with stowaways, don't you?

02:20.382 --> 02:21.882
You make them walk the plank?

02:21.958 --> 02:24.459
Actually, no.

02:24.536 --> 02:28.147
I was planning on dropping you off
at the nearest port, even Stephens.

02:28.223 --> 02:32.893
But walk the plank?! Now, that's
a great idea, sweetheart!

02:32.969 --> 02:35.154
Why didn't I think of that?

02:35.230 --> 02:36.563
Nice one. [Awkward chuckle]

02:36.640 --> 02:41.309
Gather round, you land-lubbin',
scurvy-ridden swine!

02:41.387 --> 02:46.556
See what happens to those who
oppose Captain Bloody Typhoid Mary.

02:46.558 --> 02:48.909
Um, I don't see a crew.

02:48.985 --> 02:52.062
Aye. We were 20 strong

02:52.064 --> 02:54.398
when we set sail
from Port Hydra,

02:54.400 --> 02:56.750
seeking a treasure so grand,

02:56.826 --> 02:58.826
the very sight of it
has driven many men mad.

02:58.904 --> 03:02.848
Four days into crossing
the Sea of Bitter Tears,

03:02.925 --> 03:05.667
the men were seasick,
suffering from dysentery.

03:05.744 --> 03:09.855
The trip couldn't get any better.
When, suddenly, there was a...

03:09.932 --> 03:11.075
Oh, shoot. What's the word?
Oh, yeah.

03:11.099 --> 03:14.526
A mutiny. So the crew had to go.

03:14.603 --> 03:18.104
Wha... "Go"? Go, go,
like, they swam somewhere?

03:18.181 --> 03:19.301
A nice little island, maybe?

03:19.349 --> 03:22.926
Swim? [Giggles] You're cute.

03:22.928 --> 03:27.447
They couldn't swim. But all their
splashing sure got the sharks' attention.

03:27.524 --> 03:32.452
So your old crew is gone, and you've
got no crew steering the ship?

03:32.529 --> 03:34.704
I've got it under control.

03:39.111 --> 03:41.202
Now, where were we?
Oh, yeah. The plank!

03:41.280 --> 03:43.871
It's just water.

03:43.949 --> 03:46.783
But oh, while you're down there, could
you do something about all those sharks?

03:46.785 --> 03:50.896
They keep following me around.
It's so annoying.

03:50.973 --> 03:55.234
Can't you, like, call some
crustaceans to come rescue us?

03:55.310 --> 03:56.590
What do I look like? Shrimp-Boy?

03:57.796 --> 03:59.980
[gasps]

04:00.056 --> 04:01.907
[growls]

04:04.303 --> 04:07.988
Oh, drat! Dread-Skull is here.

04:08.064 --> 04:10.307
"Dread-Skull"?
You mean "Red Skull"?

04:10.309 --> 04:11.917
Aye. [Grunts]

04:11.994 --> 04:13.977
The Skull rules
these here waters.

04:13.979 --> 04:16.480
That's why they call it
the Red Skull Sea.

04:16.482 --> 04:17.664
Who's "they"?

04:19.317 --> 04:20.720
[Ms. Marvel]
Red Skull and Crossbones.

04:20.744 --> 04:24.579
Okay, guys, I know we both
said some things we regret.

04:24.656 --> 04:28.916
So, how about we call a truce,
let bygones be bygones,

04:28.994 --> 04:30.918
then you two help me
fight Red Skull?

04:30.996 --> 04:32.938
Seriously? You think
we're gonna help you

04:33.015 --> 04:34.848
after you were about
to walk us off a plank?

04:34.924 --> 04:36.266
Plank? Pfft! What plank?

04:40.355 --> 04:43.673
I don't even think this ship
comes with a plank. [Laughs]

04:43.675 --> 04:47.101
Look, sweetheart, either you sail
with me or rot in Red Skull's brig.

04:47.179 --> 04:49.362
Your choice.

04:49.439 --> 04:51.072
[annoyed groans]

04:55.111 --> 04:57.612
I'll need my helmet back.
Koko, helmet!

04:57.689 --> 04:59.856
[groans] Ouch.

04:59.858 --> 05:01.633
[screeching] I hate that monkey.

05:01.710 --> 05:03.951
To your battle stations!

05:04.029 --> 05:05.787
Don't worry.
They only go after pirates.

05:05.864 --> 05:09.624
You're a pirate! Don't worry!

05:09.701 --> 05:10.925
I've got a plan for that.

05:18.134 --> 05:19.634
We are in over our heads.

05:19.711 --> 05:22.136
We gotta get away from this
ship and back to our mission.

05:22.214 --> 05:26.232
Yeah, okay, this is ridiculous,
but we can handle the situation.

05:26.309 --> 05:27.884
We're Avengers.
[metallic squeaking]

05:27.886 --> 05:30.311
The whole reason I got out of
the thief-for-hire business

05:30.389 --> 05:33.656
was to avoid the unbalanced
and unpredictably evil.

05:36.562 --> 05:38.503
[whispering] Psst! Guys! Guys!

05:38.580 --> 05:42.507
I think the flag is working!
[grunts]

05:42.584 --> 05:46.011
Yep, definitely working!
[yelling]

05:48.924 --> 05:50.006
You were saying? [Grunts]

05:54.671 --> 05:56.930
Scuttle the ship,
destroy the Avengers,

05:58.767 --> 06:00.934
but I want Typhoid Mary alive!

06:02.254 --> 06:03.520
Fire!

06:08.443 --> 06:10.369
[cannons continue firing]

06:10.445 --> 06:12.779
I'm afraid to ask,

06:12.856 --> 06:15.374
but why is Red Skull trying
to blow us out of the water?

06:15.450 --> 06:19.527
Mm, someone might have
stolen his treasure map.

06:19.605 --> 06:21.771
By any chance,
was that someone you?

06:21.773 --> 06:26.534
Hmm? I'm not sure how that's
relevant to our current situation.

06:26.612 --> 06:29.537
Anyhoo, the map leads
to the richest cache

06:29.615 --> 06:32.724
of Vibranium on Battleworld.
[grunts]

06:32.801 --> 06:35.560
Vibranium? Um, yeah.

06:35.637 --> 06:38.212
Why do you think they call it
the Vibranium Coast?

06:38.290 --> 06:39.231
Try and keep up, darlings.
[wind howling]

06:39.307 --> 06:41.625
She's got ya there.

06:41.627 --> 06:45.720
We're not gonna outrun them,
but maybe we can outgun them.

06:45.797 --> 06:47.572
Ms. Marvel,
help me load this thing.

06:47.649 --> 06:50.558
[Ms. Marvel] Grow disc
locked and loaded. [Beeping]

06:50.636 --> 06:52.152
[Ant-Man] Fire!

06:54.139 --> 06:56.397

06:56.475 --> 06:58.475
[all yelling]

06:58.477 --> 06:59.993
[water splashing]

07:00.069 --> 07:02.904
Nice embiggening!

07:02.981 --> 07:04.572
[chuckles]
Red Skull looks miserable.

07:04.650 --> 07:06.461
Betcha they've had enough
and are gonna retreat.

07:06.485 --> 07:10.712
Bring her about! Port cannons
on my command! Fire!

07:14.493 --> 07:18.328
You may take me, but you'll never
take my crew alive, Skull!

07:18.330 --> 07:20.997
As if that mattered at all.

07:20.999 --> 07:24.443
Skullbots, brace for impact!

07:24.519 --> 07:25.018
[Crossbones] Yaargh!

07:25.094 --> 07:26.561
[both yell]

07:29.174 --> 07:32.175
[Ant-Man]
Prepare to repel boarders!

07:32.177 --> 07:33.735
Too late. We're in trouble.

07:36.682 --> 07:37.682
Uh-oh.

07:39.367 --> 07:41.034
[grunting]

07:44.206 --> 07:45.464
[grunts]

07:49.528 --> 07:52.195
[grunts]
Oh. They're made out of metal.

07:52.197 --> 07:56.716
You'll never take my ship alive,
you ugly, rusty buckets!

07:58.870 --> 07:59.870
[grunts]

08:05.377 --> 08:08.811
Did she just sink her own ship? Because
it sure looks like she sunk her own ship.

08:14.553 --> 08:17.737
"By order of His Excellency,
Admiral Skull,

08:17.814 --> 08:20.724
"we hereby seize this vessel,

08:20.726 --> 08:23.835
her goods, and passengers."

08:31.403 --> 08:34.828
I cannot believe
you sunk my ship!

08:34.905 --> 08:39.667
What kind of sick monster sinks another
person's ship for absolutely no reason?

08:39.745 --> 08:43.913
You do realize you sunk your own ship,
and you shot our ship out of the sky?

08:43.914 --> 08:46.750
Hmm? I don't remember that.

08:46.752 --> 08:47.987
What do you mean
you don't remember that?

08:48.011 --> 08:49.861
Okay, I think you may have

08:49.938 --> 08:51.588
mixed me up with someone else,
Shrimp-Boy.

08:51.590 --> 08:55.349
That is your name, right? Wait.
Don't tell me. I don't care.

08:55.427 --> 08:57.702
Ugh! Why does she get a chair?

08:57.779 --> 09:01.188
Enough stalling! Tell me what
you've done with the stolen map.

09:01.266 --> 09:04.358
[grunting] Oh.

09:04.436 --> 09:06.202
Is this the map
you're looking for?

09:08.456 --> 09:11.791
Ugh! Don't ya hate it
when that happens?

09:11.868 --> 09:15.461
Without that chart, there's
no way to find the treasure.

09:15.538 --> 09:18.205
Ugh! I know that, you fool.

09:18.283 --> 09:22.619
But I know Typhoid Mary wouldn't
have destroyed the map,

09:22.621 --> 09:24.804
not unless she committed
the route to memory.

09:24.881 --> 09:26.898
Isn't that right, Mary?

09:26.975 --> 09:31.719
If I lead you to the treasure,
I get to keep it. Fairsies?

09:31.797 --> 09:33.813
This is not a negotiation.

09:33.890 --> 09:36.299
No, it's a sword, silly.

09:36.301 --> 09:38.559
Tie her to the ship's mast.

09:38.637 --> 09:42.563
Perhaps being pecked at by gulls
will loosen her tongue.

09:42.641 --> 09:44.749
Ooh, don't get my hopes up.

09:44.826 --> 09:46.810
Take her away!

09:46.812 --> 09:49.087
What about
these reject Avengers?

09:49.164 --> 09:51.423
Lock them in the brig.

09:51.499 --> 09:54.575
They may be of use,
should their friends arrive.

09:54.653 --> 09:55.985
Skullbot?

09:55.987 --> 09:59.264
Wonder what he did. If there
was more tech around,

09:59.341 --> 10:01.485
maybe I could jury-rig some way
to disable these power dampeners,

10:01.509 --> 10:05.103
or get us outta here.
Look, we got into this mess.

10:05.180 --> 10:09.349
Well, technically, Typhoid
Mary got us into this mess.

10:09.425 --> 10:11.776
But we can get
ourselves out of it.

10:11.853 --> 10:13.778
We're Avengers, right?
So, that's what we'll do.

10:17.025 --> 10:19.600
This would be easier to do
with my powers.

Hoo. Got it. [Clears throat]

10:28.778 --> 10:31.779
Sorry. Mm.

10:31.857 --> 10:34.524
Well, I don't even know
if this thing'll do any good.

10:34.526 --> 10:36.450
Oh, hey, never mind. I got it.

10:36.528 --> 10:38.470
Master thief, remember?

10:38.546 --> 10:41.714
Gotta dust off those skills
once in a while.

Ow! [Laughs] Hey, that tickles!

Hey, where are you going?
We're just getting started.

[metallic clinking on ground]

11:00.235 --> 11:01.620
You get your helmet.
I'll get Typhoid Mary

11:01.644 --> 11:04.645
and then figure out
how to get far away from here.

11:04.723 --> 11:06.147
Be careful. Why start now?

11:06.224 --> 11:08.449
Mm-hmm.

Now tell me where
your friends are. Ha!

11:50.026 --> 11:52.827
You'll never find them. By now,

12:09.621 --> 12:12.472
I'm aware of the situation.

12:12.548 --> 12:14.958
No point in resisting.

12:14.960 --> 12:17.068
There is no escape
from the Dread-Skull.

12:19.314 --> 12:20.905
[chitters]

12:20.982 --> 12:24.558
I love a good challenge.
Koko, helmet!

12:24.636 --> 12:27.412
[chitters, screeches]

12:27.489 --> 12:28.654
[chittering] [grunts]

12:31.643 --> 12:34.494
[groans] [grunts]

12:34.570 --> 12:37.255
Fool! Your parlor tricks
won't work.

12:37.332 --> 12:39.257
There's no means
of escape for you.

12:39.334 --> 12:44.578
[grunts] [Ant-Man] I found a way
out, and it is gonna be so cool!

12:44.656 --> 12:46.097
Ms. Marvel, a little hand here.

12:46.174 --> 12:48.341
Anytime.

12:48.417 --> 12:50.827
[grunts]

12:50.829 --> 12:51.829
[grunts]

12:53.331 --> 12:54.931
Shoot them!

12:56.334 --> 12:58.109
No.

13:00.672 --> 13:01.672
[gunfire continues]

13:04.843 --> 13:05.950
[Ant-Man] All aboard!

13:06.027 --> 13:09.862
[screeches, chitters] [screams]

13:09.939 --> 13:12.439
[water splashes]
Bon voyage, Red Skull!

13:12.517 --> 13:15.460
Avast ye, Avengers!

13:23.119 --> 13:24.544
Bu... I thought...

13:24.620 --> 13:29.549
Can't believe you all fell
for a little sleight of hand.

13:29.625 --> 13:31.976
Now, let's see
where we're going.

13:33.629 --> 13:38.041
According to the chart,
we stick to this heading,

13:38.043 --> 13:41.969
sail the narrow channel
between all these islands,

13:42.047 --> 13:45.139
then skirt past a sea monster,
and boom...

13:45.216 --> 13:46.974
No Treasure Here Island.

13:47.052 --> 13:50.219
[wind howling]

13:50.221 --> 13:52.405
She has no idea
what she's doing.

13:52.481 --> 13:54.441
We'll figure it out.
We've gotten this far, right?

13:58.746 --> 13:59.170
[thunderous thud]
No, no, no, no!

13:59.247 --> 14:02.156
Come about!

14:02.233 --> 14:06.010
[Ms. Marvel] Too late! Find
something that floats and hold on!

14:09.665 --> 14:13.167
[Typhoid Mary] Land ho!
[groaning]

14:13.244 --> 14:14.835
[annoyed groan]

14:14.913 --> 14:17.689
I told ya we'd find it.
[chitters]

14:17.765 --> 14:19.393
Never said we'd be in
one piece when I did.

14:19.417 --> 14:21.359
[chitters] Oh, drat.

14:21.436 --> 14:23.361
Aw, nuts. They followed us.

14:23.438 --> 14:25.104
Yep, that seems about right.

14:33.598 --> 14:35.765
Those suckers are taking
the scenic route.

14:35.767 --> 14:37.691
Come on. I know a shortcut.

14:37.769 --> 14:39.452
Hold up, T.M.
You've been here before?

14:39.528 --> 14:43.381
Who's got two thumbs and buried the
treasure here in the first place?

14:43.458 --> 14:45.216
[muffled squeal]

14:45.293 --> 14:47.960
We'd better get to it before they do.
[chitters]

14:49.631 --> 14:53.207
Hmm. Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

14:53.284 --> 14:56.210
Are you sure this is the way?

14:56.287 --> 15:00.231
One thousand and two percent.
[screeches]

15:00.308 --> 15:01.769
[chittering] What's
got her so spooked?

15:01.793 --> 15:05.795
You know, guys, sometimes
the path less traveled

15:05.797 --> 15:08.389
is, uh, less traveled
for a reason.

15:08.466 --> 15:11.743
Oh, relax. The cannibals are on the
complete other side of the island.

15:11.819 --> 15:15.471
And I'm pretty sure they're vegan.
[brush rustling]

15:15.473 --> 15:17.916
Koko! Come out
here this instant.

15:17.992 --> 15:20.084
We don't have time
for shenanigans.

15:20.161 --> 15:24.738
[roaring]

15:24.816 --> 15:28.985
[apes roaring]

15:28.987 --> 15:31.504
Aah! You're not Koko. Wrong way!

15:31.580 --> 15:33.005
[howling]

15:33.082 --> 15:35.158
Do we even want to know

15:35.160 --> 15:37.101
what you did to make the apes so angry?
[grunts]

15:37.178 --> 15:41.255
It could have something to do with Koko
being betrothed to the troop's alpha,

15:41.332 --> 15:43.182
and her running off with me.
Oh, great.

15:43.259 --> 15:45.017
Angry, jilted monkey
wants revenge.

15:45.094 --> 15:46.352
[yells] [howling continues]

15:51.025 --> 15:54.694
Typhoid Mary, we need to talk
about the meaning of "shortcut."

15:54.770 --> 15:57.680
[laughs] It worked! What worked?

15:57.682 --> 16:00.533
Am I missing something?

16:00.609 --> 16:02.209
Yeah! They're digging
in the wrong place!

16:07.208 --> 16:08.208
[crackling] Mm.

16:09.952 --> 16:12.303
Careful! [Both grunt]

16:12.380 --> 16:16.882
I can't believe I almost got squashed
by a primitive security system.

16:16.959 --> 16:20.870
Hey, buddy, watch who you're
calling primitive. [Crackling]

16:20.872 --> 16:23.706
[all scream]

16:23.708 --> 16:25.891
Eh, my bad.
Forgot about that one.

16:31.640 --> 16:34.550
"O" marks the spot?

16:34.552 --> 16:35.832
[all grunting]
[shovels thudding]

16:38.647 --> 16:40.498
Could really use
some ants right now.

16:40.575 --> 16:42.000
[clank]

16:46.080 --> 16:47.455
[grunts]

16:50.585 --> 16:54.962
"I owe you one treasure.
Signed, Typhoid Mary."

16:57.258 --> 16:59.017
What? Don't you guys trust me?

16:59.093 --> 17:01.093
Not even a little. Nope!

17:01.170 --> 17:02.186
Hmm.

17:04.173 --> 17:05.356
[Ant-Man, Ms. Marvel] Ohh.

17:13.758 --> 17:16.592
[Ms. Marvel gasps]
The Vibranium!

17:16.594 --> 17:18.359
Well, that was easy.

17:21.266 --> 17:23.449
Got it. Now we need
to call the Avengers.

17:23.526 --> 17:24.526
[Dread-Skull] Guten Tag!

17:29.440 --> 17:32.608
No more tricks, Mary.
Where's the Vibranium?

17:32.610 --> 17:35.795
Um, what Vibranium?

17:35.871 --> 17:38.297
The Vibranium we just dug up.

17:38.374 --> 17:41.300
Weren't you paying attention?
There's a ton of it!

17:41.377 --> 17:44.044
Yeesh, you guys
don't remember anything.

17:44.122 --> 17:45.346
[annoyed groan]

17:48.293 --> 17:51.069
Captured twice in one day.

17:51.145 --> 17:52.289
I think that's
a new record for me.

17:52.313 --> 17:54.888
Three, actually, if you count...

17:54.966 --> 17:56.299
Any last words, pirate scum?

17:56.301 --> 17:58.317
Yes!

17:58.394 --> 18:02.062
[ululating yell]

18:02.140 --> 18:04.073
[yell echoing]

18:07.812 --> 18:08.869
Hmm? [Mumbling shrug]

18:10.982 --> 18:13.666
[shrieking]

18:13.742 --> 18:15.093
[chitters]

18:15.169 --> 18:16.669
Hmm?

18:16.745 --> 18:19.097
[screeching]

18:19.173 --> 18:20.339
[all howling]

18:24.679 --> 18:25.679
Thanks, mate!

18:27.832 --> 18:30.516
[grunts] [grunts]

18:30.593 --> 18:33.260
[grunts]

18:33.338 --> 18:35.095
[clicks] Nowhere
to run this time!

18:35.173 --> 18:37.356
[grunts]

18:37.433 --> 18:39.266
[yells, grunts] [grunts]

18:39.344 --> 18:41.510
[groans] [howling continues]

18:41.512 --> 18:45.181
You ready to embrace the crazy?
[grunts]

18:45.183 --> 18:47.366
Not really, but we're
gonna do it anyway.

18:52.781 --> 18:55.115
Yarr, matey!

18:55.193 --> 18:57.784
[chitters] Get 'em, girls!

18:57.862 --> 18:59.545
[apes howling]

18:59.622 --> 19:01.697
[yells]

19:01.699 --> 19:02.699
[grunts]

19:04.552 --> 19:07.870
[roars]

19:07.872 --> 19:10.982
I only took Koko on a little
bachelorette weekend before the big day.

19:11.058 --> 19:12.138
You can't stay mad forever.

19:13.728 --> 19:14.728
[growls]

19:18.383 --> 19:22.142
So, truce? [Chitters]

19:22.220 --> 19:23.402
[chitters]

19:24.906 --> 19:26.555
[agreeable grunt]

19:26.557 --> 19:28.332
Good thing my parents
let me take fencing.

19:30.653 --> 19:35.414
Fine. If you insist,
I'll take the treasure myself.

19:35.491 --> 19:37.249
[yells] [yells]

19:37.326 --> 19:39.510
[both grunting]

19:39.587 --> 19:40.845
Huh?

19:40.922 --> 19:45.016
[grunts] Ms. Marvel, I've
got a primitive idea.

19:45.092 --> 19:47.518
Do it! I got this! [Grunts]

19:47.595 --> 19:49.078
[yells]

19:49.080 --> 19:51.022
[grunts, growls]

19:51.098 --> 19:53.599
Looks like your friend
cut and ran.

19:53.676 --> 19:55.251
Ready to give up now?

19:55.253 --> 19:58.103
Never! Come on, you muckrakes!

19:58.180 --> 20:00.089
Have at you!

20:00.091 --> 20:02.358
[all grunting]

20:10.618 --> 20:13.436
Now I've got you.

20:13.438 --> 20:15.496
[Ant-Man]
So long, barnacle breath!

20:18.960 --> 20:21.702
[grunts]

20:21.779 --> 20:24.780
[grunts]
You think a net can stop me?

20:24.782 --> 20:27.132
[both groaning]

20:27.209 --> 20:30.803
Arr, matey.

20:30.879 --> 20:32.099
[Iron Man]
I found the Avenjet wreckage,

20:32.123 --> 20:36.141
but no sign of Ant-Man
or Ms. Marvel.

20:36.218 --> 20:38.852
They've gotta be out here somewhere.
[beeps]

20:45.803 --> 20:49.396
Heavey-ho, you salty sea apes!

20:49.474 --> 20:51.490
Put your back into it!

20:51.567 --> 20:52.750
[cackling]

20:58.483 --> 21:00.627
[Iron Man] Let me get this straight.
You two just let Typhoid Mary go?

21:00.651 --> 21:04.762
We kinda had to. We couldn't have
completed our mission without her help.

21:04.839 --> 21:07.006
Well, then,
I respect that choice.

21:07.082 --> 21:08.915
We're not in trouble?

21:08.993 --> 21:11.752
Looks to me like you both
made the right call.

21:11.829 --> 21:13.064
With the odds
stacked against you,

21:13.088 --> 21:15.106
you made a leadership decision,
and it paid off.

21:15.182 --> 21:18.943
Of course, having such an excellent
role model doesn't hurt.

21:19.020 --> 21:22.780
This is more than enough Vibranium
to rebuild the Bifrost.

21:22.857 --> 21:25.190
Great work, you guys. Now what
say we get back to the base?

21:26.861 --> 21:34.861
[both] Aye, Captain.
