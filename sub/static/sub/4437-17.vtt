Good boy.

11:13.590 --> 11:16.469
Guys, it's not safe out there.
Ergman's still looking for you .

11:16.676 --> 11:17.768
- What do we do!
- Ah, dang!

11:17.969 --> 11:21.223
- I'm scared, Mabel!
- Don't worry, guys, he has to give up eventually.

11:21.514 --> 11:24.063
Hey, in the meantime
you could stay here with us!

11:24.267 --> 11:25.985
-( Cheer ) All right!
- Twenty thirteen!

11:26.227 --> 11:29.026
Girls, do you realize
what's happening here?

11:29.230 --> 11:31.153
We have our very own
pet boy band

11:31.357 --> 11:33.155
that we can do
whatever we want with!

11:33.359 --> 11:35.737
Remember, eventually we
have to let them go.

11:35.945 --> 11:40.826
We have to promise not to get too
attached to them, right, Mabel? Mabel?

11:41.034 --> 11:42.877
All aboard the braid train!

11:44.370 --> 11:45.462

All right, it took all clay,
but I converted it to a record.

12:25.828 --> 12:29.207
And now we can slow it down to see
if the mind control message theory is correct!

12:29.499 --> 12:31.172
Prepare to have your mind blown.

Mabel was right.
Wendy just likes the song!

Ah, memories.

13:58.755 --> 14:00.302
The music industry
was shaken today

14:00.506 --> 14:03.885
at the news that boy band king,
Ergman Bratsman, has been arrested.

14:04.093 --> 14:07.267
He was pulled over tonight
for not having a rear license plate.

14:07.472 --> 14:10.146
I'm telling you!
The goat took it!

14:10.350 --> 14:11.852
That's what they all say.

14:12.393 --> 14:14.987
He is now in county jail,
awaiting trial.

14:15.355 --> 14:16.026
Yes!

14:31.496 --> 14:34.375
That evil producer is gone,
we have to tell the boys.

14:34.665 --> 14:37.168
Wait, girls,
let's not be so hasty.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.755
I mean, think about it.
If we don't tell the boys,

14:39.962 --> 14:42.886
then they can stay here with me!
I mean, with us.

14:43.091 --> 14:44.889
Mabel, we can't
keep them here forever.

14:45.093 --> 14:46.265
But I love them!

14:46.469 --> 14:48.267
F you loved them,
you'd set them free.

14:48.471 --> 14:51.065
Never! Every boy I loved
this summer has left me,

14:51.265 --> 14:53.017
and I'm not gonna
let it happen again.

14:53.226 --> 14:56.150

Woah! Is that true, Mabel-Dog?

15:11.786 --> 15:13.959
Uh, no, your producer's
still out there.

15:14.163 --> 15:16.757
You're gonna have to
stay here, probably forever!

15:16.958 --> 15:18.585
What? You can't listen to her!

15:18.793 --> 15:22.423
Mabel's our girl, girl. She
puts pizza in our food trough.

prepare to be ignored!

16:18.811 --> 16:20.939
Ha, weird, Nate didn't show up.

16:21.147 --> 16:23.320
So I, I guess it's
just you and me.

anything about those messages.
