06:15.879 --> 06:17.171
Searching for the reasons,

06:17.254 --> 06:19.630
was essentially pointless.

06:19.712 --> 06:21.296
How it all started?

06:22.338 --> 06:24.087
Well, at the end of that question

06:24.171 --> 06:26.463
what you hope to find
is a person to blame.

06:27.463 --> 06:30.712
Someone who messed up the
party for everyone else.

06:30.795 --> 06:33.921
Some guy high up the food
chain who pushed the button.

06:36.254 --> 06:37.588
And if that doesn't work,

06:38.546 --> 06:41.087
a force of nature or some
higher power comes in handy

06:41.171 --> 06:42.921
as an excuse.

06:43.004 --> 06:45.795
At least so we can tell ourselves
that we weren't to blame.

06:47.754 --> 06:49.879
It wasn't for any one
reason the world came

06:49.962 --> 06:51.379
to be what it is now.

06:52.338 --> 06:54.379
In the end,

06:54.463 --> 06:55.712
we were all guilty.

06:56.754 --> 07:00.087
When you pass the tipping
point there's no way back.

07:00.171 --> 07:02.087
When devastating sickness drives the world

07:02.171 --> 07:05.588
into a war involving almost
every nation that is left.

07:05.670 --> 07:09.171
When families maul each other
over the last drop of water.

07:09.254 --> 07:12.962
When society has given up.

07:13.046 --> 07:15.505
Then there's only one thing left, I.

07:16.837 --> 07:18.171
No us,

07:18.254 --> 07:19.670
no we,

07:19.754 --> 07:20.588
no they,

07:21.463 --> 07:23.546
everyone for themselves.

07:23.630 --> 07:24.796
Which leaves no other option,

07:24.879 --> 07:27.004
than each one against
the other, I suppose.

07:28.254 --> 07:30.213
Back to the survival of the fittest,

07:31.046 --> 07:33.213
seems like only a few
turn out to be fit enough

07:33.296 --> 07:34.171
to begin with.

07:35.588 --> 07:37.588
I don't know of anyone else who made it.

07:38.712 --> 07:40.046
I don't need to either.

07:45.129 --> 07:46.379
Life has changed,

07:46.463 --> 07:49.670
one might say for the worse
but I'm not the judge.

07:49.754 --> 07:52.171
You have to earn your survival.

07:52.254 --> 07:56.837
You gotta eat, build a
fire and defend yourself.

07:56.921 --> 07:58.921
Because no one else will do it for you.

08:02.796 --> 08:04.421
You learn things quickly,

08:04.505 --> 08:05.338
you have to.

08:13.921 --> 08:18.046
Success and failure, life and death,

08:18.129 --> 08:19.712
more connected than ever.

10:46.380 --> 10:48.671
You're the first person
I've seen in months.

10:50.004 --> 10:51.921
I don't even know how long it's been.

10:54.921 --> 10:55.796
What day it is.

11:01.671 --> 11:03.255
But who's keeping track, right?

11:07.796 --> 11:09.129
It's the 27th,

11:11.046 --> 11:11.879
August,

11:14.171 --> 11:15.004
Monday.

11:16.921 --> 11:19.296
You counted, smart.

11:21.088 --> 11:22.879
So, what's your story?

11:22.963 --> 11:23.963
Is this your trap?

11:25.504 --> 11:26.796
Yeah.

11:26.879 --> 11:27.796
Found a bunch of them right out-

11:27.879 --> 11:28.629
You've eaten rats?

11:28.712 --> 11:29.462
What?

11:29.546 --> 11:30.712
Kid, you can roast them black.

11:30.796 --> 11:33.380
You'll still die of
infection if you eat them.

11:33.462 --> 11:34.879
You don't think I know that?

11:35.796 --> 11:38.338
Jesus, man, how do you
think I survived in here?

11:38.420 --> 11:40.213
Those traps are there to protect me.

11:43.088 --> 11:45.629
- Where are you headed?
- What do you care?

11:47.546 --> 11:48.921
Hey, you're Mr. Cheerful.

11:50.004 --> 11:51.213
I'm headed to a shelter.

11:53.338 --> 11:54.629
I don't know what your plans are,

11:54.712 --> 11:59.712
but I thought maybe we could team up.

12:05.754 --> 12:07.712
I know where to find water.

12:07.796 --> 12:08.629
Where?

12:09.587 --> 12:10.462
Well, if you follow that line

12:10.546 --> 12:11.754
- of trees out there-
- Show me.

12:14.255 --> 12:15.754
Hey, you got a map!

12:15.838 --> 12:17.587
Must have come a long way, huh?

12:17.671 --> 12:20.088
I'm a bit more of a camper myself,

12:20.171 --> 12:22.171
till I ran out of supplies.

12:22.255 --> 12:25.796
Anyway, it should be right around here.

12:25.879 --> 12:28.796
No, I'm not going there.

12:28.879 --> 12:31.046
I only move in this direction.

12:31.130 --> 12:33.671
Yeah but, you know
there are people there.

12:33.754 --> 12:35.963
I'm not going there.

12:38.546 --> 12:40.088
Don't you wanna find anybody?

12:40.921 --> 12:42.420
More mouths to feed.

12:45.255 --> 12:46.213
Jesus, man.

12:48.462 --> 12:49.296
So then what?

12:50.546 --> 12:51.379
That's it?

12:53.754 --> 12:57.337
Look, kid, I'm heading in
this direction all the way down

12:57.420 --> 12:58.337
to the river source.

12:58.420 --> 12:59.337
No discussion.

13:00.171 --> 13:01.671
I hope to find water there.

13:03.046 --> 13:05.295
Now, if I were you, I
wouldn't go this way.

13:06.295 --> 13:09.546
You won't find anything or anyone.

13:10.546 --> 13:12.046
There's nothing there for you.

13:12.921 --> 13:13.963
Good luck then.

13:48.295 --> 13:49.130
Hey!

13:51.462 --> 13:52.546
Last chance, kid.

13:55.796 --> 13:57.796
You always get up this early?

13:57.879 --> 13:59.963
No, sometimes earlier.

14:00.963 --> 14:01.879
My God!

14:03.046 --> 14:04.504
My name is Joshua by the way.

14:06.421 --> 14:07.254
Alexander.

14:09.004 --> 14:11.171
Well, then good morning.

14:15.838 --> 14:18.838
Someone might be able to help
you get your things organized.

14:20.254 --> 14:21.379
Lend you an ear...

14:21.462 --> 14:23.671
- Yeah.
- That sort of stuff.

14:23.754 --> 14:25.796
You really only get that in a group.

14:29.130 --> 14:31.088
Look, all I'm saying is that I've heard

14:31.171 --> 14:33.337
that there are people at
that shelter, and I think we,

14:37.462 --> 14:38.379
what is it?

15:11.337 --> 15:12.546
Alexander!

15:13.671 --> 15:14.963
Hey, Alexander, over here!

15:18.170 --> 15:19.005
Up ahead!

15:22.546 --> 15:24.879
Will you shut the hell up!

15:31.212 --> 15:33.170
Come on, we gotta pick up the pace.

15:36.629 --> 15:38.254
What the hell is your problem?

15:39.671 --> 15:43.421
My problem is I don't
wanna get killed out here.

15:43.504 --> 15:45.046
By what?

15:45.130 --> 15:46.337
We're being followed.

15:46.421 --> 15:48.629
Who do you think is
following us out here?

15:48.713 --> 15:52.838
It's not a person, it's something else.

15:52.921 --> 15:54.379
I've seen it kill someone.

15:54.462 --> 15:55.296
Now move!

16:01.921 --> 16:04.796
What the hell is wrong with you?

16:04.879 --> 16:08.838
Listen, there's some
kinda creature out there.

16:12.421 --> 16:13.796
It caught someone I've been traveling with

16:13.879 --> 16:16.754
and injected poison into him right here.

16:18.379 --> 16:21.421
You don't wanna get caught
by this thing, I don't.

16:22.337 --> 16:23.462
I'd rather kill myself.

16:27.212 --> 16:28.588
You have a gun, why
didn't you just shoot it?

16:28.671 --> 16:31.588
Yeah, my guy had a gun too.

16:31.671 --> 16:32.879
It didn't save his life.

16:33.838 --> 16:37.170
Look, if you wanna survive out here,

16:37.254 --> 16:39.337
there's some things you gotta learn.

16:39.421 --> 16:41.046
Never go back.

16:41.129 --> 16:42.713
Never stand still.

16:46.337 --> 16:48.880
- Lead the way...
- And stay quiet!

17:08.421 --> 17:09.753
Drink something.

17:14.128 --> 17:15.462
It's all I got.

17:17.296 --> 17:19.087
Save it then.

17:19.171 --> 17:20.962
We are going to a well, remember?

17:25.503 --> 17:28.087
How do you know it's not dried
up, like everywhere else?

17:28.171 --> 17:29.212
It's a gut feeling.

17:47.713 --> 17:48.546
We're here.

17:49.588 --> 17:50.421
Here?

17:51.796 --> 17:53.379
Must be somewhere around here.

17:58.004 --> 17:59.546
I can't see it.

17:59.629 --> 18:00.796
So help me find it.

18:37.296 --> 18:38.296
Alexander.

18:39.838 --> 18:41.212
Alexander!

18:41.296 --> 18:43.671
Tell me, this wasn't complete bullshit.

18:47.045 --> 18:50.546
Fuck, I knew we should've
gone the other way!

18:50.629 --> 18:51.755
Why didn't you listen to me?

18:51.838 --> 18:53.254
- Keep your voice down.
- What?

18:53.337 --> 18:54.921
You expect to find water?

18:55.004 --> 18:56.254
Just like that?

18:56.337 --> 18:58.379
A nice, clean fountain,

18:58.463 --> 19:00.629
- or maybe with a rainbow?
- Cut it, kid, shut up.

19:00.713 --> 19:02.212
We need to find supplies!

19:03.504 --> 19:06.296
I have survived on bottled water only.

19:06.379 --> 19:08.880
I haven't seen a single
fucking drop out here.

19:08.962 --> 19:10.629
So what makes you think,
you're so much better at this?

19:10.713 --> 19:12.129
It's the source, all right?

19:15.296 --> 19:16.254
It's just dried up.

19:20.045 --> 19:21.296
What is it with you?

19:21.379 --> 19:23.379
We need to go back!

19:23.463 --> 19:26.463
There are people at that
shelter and there's water.

19:26.546 --> 19:28.212
There, that direction.

19:29.212 --> 19:30.880
Go ahead and die then, genius.

19:34.463 --> 19:35.379
Wait, wait, wait!

19:36.421 --> 19:37.254
Wait.

19:42.171 --> 19:43.254
It's getting dark.

19:44.254 --> 19:45.920
I say we lay our heads
down for a few hours

19:46.004 --> 19:47.796
and see where we're at, all right?

19:47.880 --> 19:49.671
There's a gap in the rocks up there.

19:51.046 --> 19:53.713
Seems like a pretty save
place to me, what do you say?

20:18.338 --> 20:19.838
You found water.

21:03.796 --> 21:05.254
So we found your water.

21:07.588 --> 21:10.212
I'd say we go back, to the people.

21:12.546 --> 21:15.212
- Not today, of course.
- We got water.

21:17.296 --> 21:18.338
That's what I said.

21:19.212 --> 21:22.630
It's just enough to reach
the larger lakes up North-East.

21:22.713 --> 21:24.171
I've already marked it, here.

21:25.046 --> 21:27.004
I came here with you.

21:27.087 --> 21:29.046
And I only ask for this one thing...

21:29.129 --> 21:30.671
I wasn't shitting you earlier.

21:30.755 --> 21:31.546
There is something out there.

21:31.630 --> 21:32.713
Even if there is something out there,

21:32.795 --> 21:35.004
what are the odds of walking into it?

21:35.087 --> 21:35.921
With you?

21:38.421 --> 21:40.254
You can take your share of the water.

21:54.338 --> 21:56.755
You'd just let me go, huh?

21:56.837 --> 21:58.171
You tell me, there's
this horrible creature

21:58.254 --> 21:59.795
and that I die if I go out there

21:59.879 --> 22:02.421
and you just gonna fucking let me go?

22:02.504 --> 22:04.421
All I'm saying is, you're a free man.

22:07.588 --> 22:10.421
Yeah, thanks for nothing.

22:13.296 --> 22:14.129
I'm staying.

22:16.046 --> 22:17.338
Make sure it's closed.

22:48.004 --> 22:48.837
Fuck!

22:52.463 --> 22:53.546
What are you doing?

22:57.671 --> 22:59.087
I told you to close it.

23:08.754 --> 23:10.338
I did close it.

23:10.421 --> 23:11.754
Look, it ate right through.

23:13.837 --> 23:14.754
What do we do now?

23:45.670 --> 23:47.796
We're not gonna make it.

23:49.879 --> 23:52.213
We still have our bottles.

23:53.379 --> 23:55.379
The lakes are too far.

24:00.129 --> 24:02.670
We have other options, you know?

24:02.754 --> 24:04.630
We could still go back to the shelter.

24:06.421 --> 24:07.837
This was you.

24:11.171 --> 24:12.546
This was your plan!

24:12.629 --> 24:14.213
You son of a bitch!

24:14.296 --> 24:15.796
Why did you do it?

24:17.129 --> 24:19.463
Do you know what you've done?

24:19.546 --> 24:22.338
Do you have the slightest
idea what you've done?

24:22.421 --> 24:25.379
I didn't do it, it was a fucking rat!

24:25.463 --> 24:26.379
Prove it!

24:28.213 --> 24:29.754
This was my water, too, okay?

24:50.629 --> 24:52.505
You know that doesn't work.

24:52.587 --> 24:53.921
You said so yourself.

24:55.587 --> 24:56.837
You can roast them black.

25:00.254 --> 25:01.254
We should go back.

25:08.463 --> 25:10.213
How do you know we'll find water?

25:12.421 --> 25:13.463
It's a gut feeling.

25:22.296 --> 25:23.546
Is that a Geiger counter?

25:28.837 --> 25:32.171
You're always busy with
that thing, what's it for?

25:32.254 --> 25:34.921
That thing out there I told you about.

25:35.004 --> 25:37.545
Somehow this has proven
reliable on detecting it.

25:39.129 --> 25:41.171
Saved my life a couple of times already.

25:42.587 --> 25:43.921
You got batteries for it?

25:45.046 --> 25:46.921
One, in here.

25:50.129 --> 25:53.129
You think it could power my phone?

25:54.088 --> 25:55.587
Your what?

25:55.671 --> 25:57.545
You got someone you wanna call, kid?

25:57.629 --> 25:58.463
No.

26:00.545 --> 26:02.837
I have some pictures on there, that's all.

26:09.505 --> 26:10.338
Sorry.

26:15.421 --> 26:19.338
You don't like talking
much about yourself, do you?

26:19.421 --> 26:20.338
You got a family?

26:23.129 --> 26:23.879
Where are you from?

26:23.963 --> 26:25.796
You must have someone who misses you.

26:25.879 --> 26:27.046
None of your business.

26:30.171 --> 26:31.421
I was part of a group.

26:33.504 --> 26:35.296
That's probably why I'm still alive.

26:38.587 --> 26:39.796
We were staying at that storage place,

26:39.879 --> 26:43.921
we had food and water.

26:44.004 --> 26:45.004
Why did you leave?

26:46.046 --> 26:47.380
We used it up eventually.

26:49.171 --> 26:50.213
We were three people.

26:52.296 --> 26:53.879
The other two were lovers.

26:57.629 --> 26:58.837
They met after all this.

27:01.879 --> 27:03.504
They fell for each other I guess.

27:04.587 --> 27:08.587
Wouldn't you know it, that's my luck.

27:08.671 --> 27:09.963
It's the end of the world.

27:10.879 --> 27:14.255
And I meet possibly the
last woman on earth,

27:15.587 --> 27:16.421
and she's taken.

27:18.671 --> 27:20.879
You know, sometimes you
forget what they look like.

27:22.380 --> 27:23.213
The smell,

27:25.129 --> 27:25.963
the hair,

27:28.671 --> 27:30.255
the other guy was an alpha-male.

27:32.754 --> 27:33.921
He wasn't into sharing.

27:36.587 --> 27:39.629
Can't say I blame the
man, but why did you leave?

27:41.504 --> 27:43.837
Well, lovers have a
way of sticking together.

27:45.088 --> 27:46.921
Down to the last can of macaroni,

27:49.255 --> 27:52.296
that's what got them, food poisoning.

27:54.504 --> 27:55.587
It turns out expiration dates,

27:55.671 --> 27:57.546
are more than just a marketing scheme.

27:58.796 --> 28:02.671
After she died, we had a fight, split up.

28:06.879 --> 28:09.296
You don't really see much of
anyone anymore around here.

28:10.380 --> 28:11.712
I went back, eventually.

28:12.796 --> 28:14.004
So you found him then?

28:15.504 --> 28:17.587
Dead, yeah.

28:19.171 --> 28:21.587
Probably starved or something.

28:21.671 --> 28:22.587
Did you eat him?

28:24.338 --> 28:25.171
No!

28:27.379 --> 28:30.213
I'm messing with you, kid.

28:30.296 --> 28:33.587
All right, listen, I've
been doing all right,

28:33.671 --> 28:35.088
given the circumstances.

28:36.379 --> 28:38.921
I don't need to hang on to
any group or leader desperate

28:39.004 --> 28:40.338
for guidance or whatever.

28:41.338 --> 28:43.796
I move where I move and I
don't search for people.

28:44.963 --> 28:47.462
I've made my point by
staying alive this far.

29:18.255 --> 29:19.796
We'll set up camp here.

29:19.879 --> 29:21.130
Find some wood.

30:58.379 --> 30:59.921
What was that song you played?

31:03.171 --> 31:04.171
The song you played.

31:05.130 --> 31:05.963
Chopin.

31:08.004 --> 31:08.838
Nocturnes.

31:10.462 --> 31:11.379
You a musician?

31:13.713 --> 31:16.212
No, not really.

31:22.212 --> 31:24.879
Is that the only one you know?

31:27.671 --> 31:28.504
Couple more.

31:37.337 --> 31:40.921
Jesus, Alex, if you want
me to play more, just ask.

32:27.379 --> 32:28.212
You all right?

32:29.421 --> 32:31.838
How do you survive on so little water?

32:35.254 --> 32:37.212
Here, suck on a stone.

32:43.088 --> 32:45.337
You're kidding me, right?

32:47.005 --> 32:48.379
It stimulates the saliva.

32:49.629 --> 32:52.296
Doesn't change anything but
it helps with the thirst.

32:57.296 --> 32:59.337
It's all right, I cleaned them thoroughly

33:10.170 --> 33:11.963
- Doesn't work.
- Give it time.

33:14.212 --> 33:15.504
My mouth is all dry.

33:42.629 --> 33:43.379
You need it.

33:43.462 --> 33:44.504
Take it, I'm good.

33:54.421 --> 33:55.254
Thanks.

34:14.129 --> 34:16.254
The damage a rat can do.

34:33.210 --> 34:34.295
Hey.

34:34.379 --> 34:35.212
Hello!

34:36.503 --> 34:38.170
Last warning, kid!

34:55.629 --> 34:57.296
Hey, stay behind me.

35:31.087 --> 35:31.921
Fuck you!

35:33.379 --> 35:35.796
If we'd come here sooner
they would have been alive.

35:37.296 --> 35:38.379
This was suicide.

35:40.045 --> 35:42.629
And what do you think
you would have found here?

35:42.713 --> 35:45.087
Why do you think they killed themselves?

35:45.171 --> 35:47.880
You think they were having a good time?

35:47.962 --> 35:48.962
You think they had water

35:49.045 --> 35:51.546
or anything else you'd hoped to find?

35:51.629 --> 35:52.463
Here.

35:53.296 --> 35:54.254
They'd be alive.

35:54.337 --> 35:55.713
You stupid piece of shit!

35:58.796 --> 36:00.129
Hey!

36:00.212 --> 36:00.962
Hey!

36:01.046 --> 36:03.546
You idiot, that's the thing!

36:20.713 --> 36:21.546
Hey!

37:18.629 --> 37:21.004
What the fuck!

37:21.087 --> 37:21.920
Fuck.

38:29.296 --> 38:30.046
Fuck!

38:30.129 --> 38:32.212
- Alexander! Alexander!
- Calm down, calm down.

38:32.296 --> 38:33.087
What the fuck!

38:33.171 --> 38:34.379
Tell me! Tell me, where is it?

38:34.463 --> 38:36.837
- Where is it?
- It's behind me!

38:36.921 --> 38:38.921
Come on, Come on!

38:39.004 --> 38:39.837
Come on!

38:53.254 --> 38:56.754
Listen to me just this
one time and shut up.

38:56.837 --> 38:59.004
I will get us out of here.

40:52.754 --> 40:53.879
We lost the map.

41:00.546 --> 41:01.379
I'm sorry.

41:03.837 --> 41:06.546
- I didn't mean to put us in...
- We made it, all right?

41:09.879 --> 41:11.921
- You saved me, man!
- Whatever.

41:13.171 --> 41:14.463
Next time listen to me.

41:17.670 --> 41:18.879
You need to trust me.

41:23.129 --> 41:24.463
I wanted to fix it.

41:26.338 --> 41:27.754
I want to make things right.

41:29.213 --> 41:30.254
Be a team, you know?

41:33.587 --> 41:35.046
I put the rat in the canister.

41:39.213 --> 41:40.046
I'm sorry.

41:45.837 --> 41:47.712
I didn't know what else I could do.

41:47.796 --> 41:48.879
Hey, Alex!

41:48.962 --> 41:49.837
Hey!

42:07.421 --> 42:09.545
Please, please, sir.

42:09.629 --> 42:12.587
I already told you
lady, I don't help scabs.

42:12.670 --> 42:13.587
It's not for me.

42:13.670 --> 42:15.629
It's for my daughter, two tickets.

42:16.545 --> 42:17.296
What are you, deaf?

42:17.380 --> 42:18.712
I ain't interested.

42:18.796 --> 42:19.837
And you have no ticket.

42:19.921 --> 42:21.505
How can you get on the ship?

42:22.754 --> 42:23.837
I'll figure it out.

42:25.296 --> 42:28.380
This
is all I have, please.

42:28.463 --> 42:30.837
Pure silver, you can sell for good money.

42:33.046 --> 42:36.088
It is too late for me,
but she still has time.

42:36.171 --> 42:38.046
If she could only make it to the ship.

42:40.254 --> 42:41.587
She looks scrawny.

42:41.671 --> 42:42.505
She is strong.

42:42.587 --> 42:43.837
She can keep up.

42:44.712 --> 42:46.380
Well, she better
'cause I ain't slowing down.

42:46.463 --> 42:47.962
Oh,
thank you, thank you, sir.

42:48.046 --> 42:51.046
Don't touch me, all right?

42:52.213 --> 42:53.046
Let's go.

42:58.629 --> 42:59.921
Lex, this is...

43:00.837 --> 43:01.671
Cal.

43:10.963 --> 43:12.046
All right, let's move.

43:16.171 --> 43:17.921
Lex.

43:41.046 --> 43:42.754
All right, we got to go.

43:42.837 --> 43:44.754
- Mama!
- Come on.

43:50.129 --> 43:50.963
Mama!

44:01.421 --> 44:03.296
Shit, are you all right?

44:03.380 --> 44:04.255
Can you run?

44:04.338 --> 44:05.088
- Mama.
- Hey.

44:05.171 --> 44:06.213
I said can you run?

44:06.296 --> 44:07.421
- Yes.
- Then you run.

44:07.504 --> 44:10.171
Run!

44:14.629 --> 44:16.129
Don't stop, keep running.

44:17.462 --> 44:18.296
I said move!

44:32.712 --> 44:33.462
They won't come into the valley,

44:33.546 --> 44:35.629
until they've cleared the ridge.

44:35.712 --> 44:37.088
Come on, let's keep moving.

44:57.879 --> 45:01.088
We used to come here when we were kids.

45:02.129 --> 45:03.379
That was a long time ago.

45:10.838 --> 45:12.671
Yeah, this whole valley used
to be some of the best farmland

45:12.754 --> 45:13.587
in the country,

45:16.587 --> 45:17.963
before you scabs showed up.

45:23.296 --> 45:26.921
Bringing that disease,
just ended everything.

45:34.338 --> 45:35.671
Why'd you come here anyway?

45:38.504 --> 45:41.420
{\an8}My land is a (SPEAKS
IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) war.

45:43.754 --> 45:46.420
My papa died, so my mama take me away.

45:50.171 --> 45:52.796
Yeah, well, you brought
that war here, didn't you?

45:53.712 --> 45:54.754
You've taken our lands, our homes.

45:54.838 --> 45:57.629
You've taken our lives
away from us, you know?

46:04.088 --> 46:08.171
You people should go back
to where you came from.

46:14.879 --> 46:15.712
Shit.

46:24.587 --> 46:26.255
You know how to use one of these?

46:27.546 --> 46:29.255
Point it at the thing you wanna kill,

46:30.255 --> 46:31.379
then you pull on this.

46:36.796 --> 46:40.379
We should be able to make
it halfway by nightfall.

46:40.462 --> 46:41.295
Come on.

47:15.337 --> 47:18.713
So what happened to your father?

47:18.796 --> 47:21.213
The Schebonya come to my village.

47:22.088 --> 47:26.629
My papa fight them and was killed.

47:29.088 --> 47:29.921
That sucks.

47:31.088 --> 47:32.713
It was long time ago.

47:36.046 --> 47:37.254
So how'd you get here?

47:38.796 --> 47:41.462
When the Schebonya come
for me and my mother,

47:41.546 --> 47:43.796
we ran to the house of my uncle.

47:47.462 --> 47:51.337
He give us tickets to
the ship so we come here.

47:51.421 --> 47:54.838
Hiding in ditches, bushes, fields.

47:59.254 --> 48:00.754
You walked all the way here?

48:01.879 --> 48:02.713
Yes.

48:05.838 --> 48:09.046
You used to live in this valley?

48:09.130 --> 48:09.963
Yeah.

48:11.212 --> 48:12.629
Yeah, I did.

48:12.713 --> 48:14.879
What was it like before?

48:17.921 --> 48:18.879
It was beautiful.

48:20.462 --> 48:21.504
There used to be a windmill.

48:28.295 --> 48:29.671
What is it?

48:29.754 --> 48:32.170
That's trouble.

48:33.088 --> 48:34.629
Grab a stick.

48:34.713 --> 48:35.462
A stick?

48:35.546 --> 48:36.379
Grab something.

48:46.379 --> 48:48.421
We call 'em bogeys,

48:48.504 --> 48:49.879
on account of the boogeyman.

48:50.838 --> 48:53.671
They are coming for us?

48:53.754 --> 48:57.170
Yeah, but they don't like fire,

48:57.254 --> 49:01.671
so they should keep
their distance, unless...

49:03.046 --> 49:04.129
Unless what?

49:05.754 --> 49:07.088
Unless they're not alone.

49:12.421 --> 49:13.254
Oh, boy.

49:42.046 --> 49:43.629
You son of a bitch.

49:51.838 --> 49:53.087
Back, get back!

49:56.129 --> 49:58.212
All right, who wants it?

50:08.296 --> 50:09.629
They are dead?

50:11.379 --> 50:12.212
Yeah.

50:15.880 --> 50:18.462
- Something else is coming?
- Maybe.

50:19.963 --> 50:22.546
I don't know.

50:22.629 --> 50:24.212
I don't know.

50:26.546 --> 50:27.921
You all right?

50:28.005 --> 50:28.838
Yes.

50:29.838 --> 50:30.671
Are you?

50:31.880 --> 50:32.713
Yeah.

50:35.754 --> 50:38.087
You should probably try and get some rest.

50:38.171 --> 50:40.129
I'll keep a look out, it's okay.

50:56.171 --> 50:57.629
I will be like them.

51:02.880 --> 51:03.713
Soon.

51:04.880 --> 51:08.087
I will change and I will become like them.

51:09.045 --> 51:09.880
No.

51:11.462 --> 51:14.087
You see, they got medicine on that ship.

51:14.171 --> 51:15.004
It can cure you.

51:17.212 --> 51:19.296
We're gonna get you
there and you'll be okay.

51:22.713 --> 51:24.296
You are good man, Cal.

51:29.171 --> 51:30.171
You get some rest.

51:32.337 --> 51:33.796
We got a ways to go tomorrow.

52:56.421 --> 52:58.838
- We are almost there.
- Whoa.

52:59.713 --> 53:03.337
- What is it?
- I don't know.

53:03.421 --> 53:04.504
I don't know.

53:05.920 --> 53:08.212
The ship is through this forest?

53:08.296 --> 53:10.212
Yeah, but something's not right.

53:13.879 --> 53:15.212
You wait here, okay?

53:15.296 --> 53:18.212
- But what about...
- Just wait here.

53:19.463 --> 53:20.629
Be right back.

54:07.837 --> 54:08.671
Shit.

54:19.879 --> 54:21.546
Hey, come on, the coast is clear.

54:22.546 --> 54:23.546
Come on, let's go.

54:37.379 --> 54:38.379
Cal.

54:40.338 --> 54:41.171
Oh, shit.

54:42.338 --> 54:43.795
Run!

54:43.879 --> 54:44.713
Run!

54:48.379 --> 54:50.296
Run, Lex, run!

55:11.379 --> 55:12.463
You goddamn scabs.

55:19.921 --> 55:20.630
Fuck.

55:20.713 --> 55:22.171
It's all gone, you happy?

55:22.254 --> 55:23.296
This makes you happy?

55:39.338 --> 55:40.171
Holy shit.

55:45.379 --> 55:46.254
Cal!

55:46.338 --> 55:47.171
Lex?

55:48.630 --> 55:49.713
Lex, look out.

55:54.338 --> 55:55.837
Lex?

55:55.921 --> 55:57.296
Lex!

55:57.379 --> 55:58.129
Cal!

55:58.213 --> 55:59.421
Are you all right?

55:59.504 --> 56:00.254
Am I all right?

56:00.338 --> 56:01.546
How are you alive?

56:01.630 --> 56:04.046
I swear I saw her shoot you in the back.

56:04.129 --> 56:06.338
She destroyed the pack.

56:06.421 --> 56:08.962
Oh, man, and you shot her?

56:11.004 --> 56:12.213
It was a good shot.

56:12.296 --> 56:13.463
It was a damn good shot.

56:15.046 --> 56:16.505
Are you all right?

56:18.421 --> 56:20.630
Well, I got shot in the back.

56:20.712 --> 56:21.546
Holy shit.

56:23.671 --> 56:24.505
Let me see.

56:33.213 --> 56:34.379
Can you stand?

56:35.338 --> 56:36.671
Yeah, I think so.

56:42.546 --> 56:44.421
I thought you had left me.

56:46.254 --> 56:47.962
No, I wouldn't leave you.

56:50.754 --> 56:53.754
Here, you should have this.

56:57.296 --> 56:59.670
Come on, let's get to the ship.

59:28.129 --> 59:29.796
Do you see anything?

59:29.879 --> 59:30.712
Nothing.

59:31.921 --> 59:33.254
They must be down there, though.

59:33.338 --> 59:34.421
I would assume.

59:36.921 --> 59:38.837
How much charge do you have?

59:38.921 --> 59:41.754
Enough for five shots, maybe.

59:41.837 --> 59:42.712
All right.

59:44.545 --> 59:46.129
And we're sure there's meds down there?

59:46.213 --> 59:47.712
It is a mobile clinic.

59:49.088 --> 59:49.921
Okay.

59:51.254 --> 59:52.088
You stay here.

59:53.213 --> 59:56.421
If anything moves, you
shoot it, understand?

59:56.504 --> 59:57.296
Duh.

59:58.338 --> 59:59.338
All right.

01:00:02.004 --> 01:00:02.837
All right.

01:00:35.088 --> 01:00:35.921
No,

01:00:36.879 --> 01:00:37.629
no.

01:00:50.587 --> 01:00:51.421
Bingo.

01:01:08.796 --> 01:01:11.129
Hello, what do we have here?

01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:16.213
Typical.

01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:23.921
Oh crap.

01:01:29.921 --> 01:01:30.921
Shoot them!

01:01:31.004 --> 01:01:32.129
Shoot them!

01:01:46.671 --> 01:01:48.338
Are you all right?

01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:51.129
No, I'm not all right, Lex!

01:01:52.046 --> 01:01:54.004
That thing was two inches from my face!

01:01:59.088 --> 01:02:00.004
You look fine.

01:02:02.255 --> 01:02:03.296
I look fine.

01:02:03.379 --> 01:02:05.004
I look fine?

01:02:05.088 --> 01:02:06.796
You're not the one that
had to stand face to face

01:02:06.879 --> 01:02:09.004
with these

01:02:09.088 --> 01:02:10.504
When I tell you to shoot, you shoot.

01:02:10.587 --> 01:02:11.420
Got it?

01:02:12.963 --> 01:02:14.671
Hey, got it?

01:02:14.754 --> 01:02:16.296
You don't have to yell at me.

01:02:17.129 --> 01:02:18.420
I'm not yelling at you.

01:02:18.504 --> 01:02:20.587
I'm just saying you gotta listen to me,

01:02:20.671 --> 01:02:22.587
when I tell you to do something, okay?

01:02:23.838 --> 01:02:25.296
Did you find anything?

01:02:26.838 --> 01:02:29.712
Not much, couple doses.

01:02:31.546 --> 01:02:33.462
We have to keep looking, then.

01:02:49.754 --> 01:02:50.587
Here

01:02:55.963 --> 01:02:57.130
You all right?

01:03:00.337 --> 01:03:01.171
Duh.

01:03:04.587 --> 01:03:06.255
It's gonna get dark soon.

01:03:06.337 --> 01:03:08.004
We should find somewhere to lay low.

01:03:08.088 --> 01:03:08.921
Yes.

01:03:29.712 --> 01:03:30.838
What you got there?

01:03:30.921 --> 01:03:31.879
A picture.

01:03:31.963 --> 01:03:33.379
From one of the bogeys.

01:03:44.587 --> 01:03:45.421
Down!

01:03:47.295 --> 01:03:48.587
That's far enough!

01:03:48.671 --> 01:03:50.171
Hello, is someone there?

01:03:50.254 --> 01:03:51.504
Turn the light off.

01:03:51.587 --> 01:03:52.963
I don't mean you any harm.

01:03:53.046 --> 01:03:53.796
Do it!

01:03:53.879 --> 01:03:54.713
Yeah, okay, okay.

01:03:57.295 --> 01:03:58.088
What do you want?

01:03:58.171 --> 01:04:02.379
I just, I saw your light, I...

01:04:02.462 --> 01:04:03.504
You what?

01:04:03.587 --> 01:04:05.838
I just thought you
might have some water.

01:04:08.462 --> 01:04:09.295
Are you armed?

01:04:10.337 --> 01:04:11.796
Yeah, I got a pistol.

01:04:11.879 --> 01:04:12.713
Throw it to me.

01:04:12.796 --> 01:04:14.462
It doesn't have any charge.

01:04:14.546 --> 01:04:15.295
Do it!

01:04:15.379 --> 01:04:16.213
Okay, okay.

01:04:18.295 --> 01:04:19.379
Now take three steps forward,

01:04:19.462 --> 01:04:21.379
then lie with your face
down to the ground.

01:04:29.796 --> 01:04:31.254
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:04:31.337 --> 01:04:32.546
Lie down.

01:04:32.629 --> 01:04:34.504
Hands where I can see them.

01:04:34.587 --> 01:04:36.005
Cal, she's not going to hurt us.

01:04:36.088 --> 01:04:36.921
You stay here.

01:04:48.088 --> 01:04:50.546
Do you have any water?

01:04:50.629 --> 01:04:51.671
I'm so thirsty.

01:04:52.671 --> 01:04:53.504
Sit up.

01:04:55.504 --> 01:04:56.587
Lex, I said stay there!

01:04:56.671 --> 01:04:58.130
She's thirsty!

01:04:58.212 --> 01:04:59.130
Yeah, but you gotta do what I say!

01:04:59.212 --> 01:05:00.421
Let her drink first!

01:05:00.504 --> 01:05:01.963
Then you can ask questions.

01:05:02.838 --> 01:05:04.796
Easy, easy, not so fast.

01:05:08.130 --> 01:05:09.170
What is your name?

01:05:10.170 --> 01:05:11.546
Taylor.

01:05:11.629 --> 01:05:14.546
I am Lex and this is Cal.

01:05:14.629 --> 01:05:15.587
Good to meet you.

01:05:17.005 --> 01:05:18.546
- Cal!
- Wait, what are you doing?

01:05:18.629 --> 01:05:21.130
You know what, I don't trust her!

01:05:21.212 --> 01:05:22.046
I'm gonna keep you restrained.

01:05:22.130 --> 01:05:23.587
You can stay with us tonight.

01:05:23.671 --> 01:05:25.088
Tomorrow, I'll set you free,

01:05:25.170 --> 01:05:27.838
and you can go your way,
and we go ours, got it?

01:05:29.379 --> 01:05:30.879
- Got it?
- Fine.

01:05:44.005 --> 01:05:49.005
So, what are you guys doing
out here so far from any town?

01:05:50.963 --> 01:05:54.129
We're looking for meds, for her.

01:05:54.212 --> 01:05:56.546
The clinics are running out of supplies.

01:05:57.588 --> 01:05:58.671
I got a couple doses.

01:05:58.754 --> 01:06:00.088
You can have 'em.

01:06:00.170 --> 01:06:02.504
They stopped working for
me a couple weeks ago.

01:06:03.462 --> 01:06:04.713
Where do you come from?

01:06:05.671 --> 01:06:06.504
Weyburn.

01:06:07.546 --> 01:06:08.462
Weyburn?

01:06:08.546 --> 01:06:09.879
How'd you get here?

01:06:09.963 --> 01:06:12.796
Joined up with a mining
crew a couple years ago.

01:06:12.879 --> 01:06:14.462
Worked in the hills.

01:06:14.546 --> 01:06:18.296
Then everything went to shit.

01:06:19.421 --> 01:06:21.046
I got caught in the middle of it.

01:06:24.296 --> 01:06:27.921
How did you become infected?

01:06:29.087 --> 01:06:30.504
When the fighting broke out,

01:06:30.588 --> 01:06:32.796
we got trapped in one of the tunnels.

01:06:34.254 --> 01:06:39.254
Scabs, they gassed us,
we all got infected.

01:06:41.005 --> 01:06:43.421
I started working odd
jobs for a few months,

01:06:43.504 --> 01:06:47.254
but once you start to look like this,

01:06:47.337 --> 01:06:50.005
people don't really
want you around anymore.

01:06:52.421 --> 01:06:53.880
How about you?

01:06:53.963 --> 01:06:54.838
How'd you get it?

01:06:56.005 --> 01:06:59.504
In my village, the
virus was in the water.

01:06:59.588 --> 01:07:00.963
We all drank it.

01:07:02.046 --> 01:07:04.379
You know, there's supposed to be a cure.

01:07:05.462 --> 01:07:07.212
Really, where?

01:07:08.129 --> 01:07:13.045
In Voskos country,
there's a city called Rama.

01:07:14.462 --> 01:07:18.462
Rama, I have heard of this place.

01:07:18.546 --> 01:07:20.713
That's where they cooked up the virus.

01:07:20.796 --> 01:07:22.504
They say that's where the cure is.

01:07:23.921 --> 01:07:25.921
Where'd you hear that?

01:07:26.005 --> 01:07:27.713
I don't know, it's just a rumor.

01:07:28.713 --> 01:07:31.421
Yeah, sounds like it.

01:07:31.504 --> 01:07:34.546
- But maybe it is true.
- Maybe.

01:07:36.421 --> 01:07:38.504
All right, I'm gonna get some sleep.

01:07:39.462 --> 01:07:40.671
You got the first watch?

01:07:51.462 --> 01:07:52.504
What you got there?

01:07:53.379 --> 01:07:54.588
It is just a picture.

01:08:00.087 --> 01:08:01.629
Are these your parents?

01:08:01.713 --> 01:08:04.087
No, I found it today, on a bogey.

01:08:08.087 --> 01:08:09.921
You can sleep, if you like.

01:08:10.004 --> 01:08:11.545
I will watch.

01:08:11.629 --> 01:08:12.463
Thanks.

01:08:37.837 --> 01:08:39.337
What's going on?

01:08:41.337 --> 01:08:42.670
Taylor.

01:08:42.755 --> 01:08:44.002
Taylor!

01:08:44.087 --> 01:08:47.629
Get back!

01:08:49.712 --> 01:08:51.587
- She is...
- She's turning.

01:08:56.337 --> 01:08:57.171
Help, help me!

01:08:59.504 --> 01:09:00.880
There's nothing we can do.

01:09:04.086 --> 01:09:04.921
Shoot her.

01:09:07.252 --> 01:09:08.086
Do it.

01:09:13.129 --> 01:09:14.670
Do it now, before she turns!

01:09:22.504 --> 01:09:23.254
Lex, now!

01:09:28.421 --> 01:09:29.252
Good.

01:09:31.170 --> 01:09:33.502
That sound's gonna attract more of them.

01:09:33.587 --> 01:09:34.671
We should keep moving.

01:09:43.129 --> 01:09:43.961
You okay?

01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:46.712
Duh.

01:09:48.129 --> 01:09:49.046
Then come on.

01:09:59.296 --> 01:10:01.796
- Hey, Cal?
- Yeah?

01:10:01.879 --> 01:10:04.129
You don't always have to yell at me.

01:10:04.212 --> 01:10:05.588
Lex, I never yell at you!

01:10:05.671 --> 01:10:07.296
Sometimes I say things that are important,

01:10:07.379 --> 01:10:09.629
and I get a little louder, okay?

01:10:09.713 --> 01:10:11.463
It sounds like yelling to me.

01:10:11.546 --> 01:10:13.046
Yeah, well, it's not,

01:10:13.129 --> 01:10:14.588
- it's...
- It's yelling.

01:10:15.463 --> 01:10:16.338
What do you want me to say?

01:10:16.421 --> 01:10:17.254
I'm sorry?

01:10:18.504 --> 01:10:19.379
Well, I'm sorry.

01:10:19.463 --> 01:10:21.713
It's okay, I forgive you.

01:10:23.671 --> 01:10:24.920
Thanks.

01:11:53.837 --> 01:11:54.671
We should go.

01:11:55.546 --> 01:11:59.129
No, too many of us are sick.

01:11:59.212 --> 01:12:00.879
It's getting colder.

01:12:00.962 --> 01:12:01.921
We're searching for a signal

01:12:02.004 --> 01:12:03.504
that doesn't want to be found.

01:12:04.504 --> 01:12:05.338
Then leave.

01:12:06.213 --> 01:12:07.962
I'm not going home empty-handed.

01:13:09.546 --> 01:13:10.296
Maya!

01:13:10.379 --> 01:13:11.213
Maya!

01:13:16.087 --> 01:13:16.837
Are you hurt?

01:13:16.921 --> 01:13:20.879
No, there's something stuck in my leg.

01:13:20.962 --> 01:13:23.004
Where is my gun?

01:13:23.087 --> 01:13:25.129
What do you mean where's your gun?

01:15:17.712 --> 01:15:18.546
We found it.

01:16:00.213 --> 01:16:01.129
You live here?

01:16:02.671 --> 01:16:03.505
By yourself?

01:16:05.796 --> 01:16:06.629
No.

01:16:09.712 --> 01:16:10.545
Leora,

01:16:13.504 --> 01:16:14.338
my daughter.

01:16:17.754 --> 01:16:18.671
Where is she?

01:16:43.837 --> 01:16:45.629
How long have you two been out here?

01:16:48.796 --> 01:16:50.004
Since the solar storm.

01:16:53.712 --> 01:16:55.004
Since the world went dark.

01:16:56.462 --> 01:16:58.754
Seven years, Jesus.

01:17:01.213 --> 01:17:02.046
How?

01:17:06.421 --> 01:17:07.255
Hey,

01:17:09.504 --> 01:17:14.338
chapstick, prevents infection.

01:17:36.046 --> 01:17:36.879
Change.

01:17:59.296 --> 01:18:01.462
Best restaurant of the trip, hands down.

01:18:17.712 --> 01:18:20.420
I can't believe that
thing actually works.

01:18:20.504 --> 01:18:24.171
Haven't seen one of those in years.

01:18:24.255 --> 01:18:26.671
We live east, 20 miles.

01:18:28.088 --> 01:18:29.587
A gated compound.

01:18:29.671 --> 01:18:30.963
Ever made it out that way?

01:18:33.088 --> 01:18:36.504
East, west, up, down,

01:18:38.296 --> 01:18:39.754
out there, it's all the same.

01:18:40.963 --> 01:18:42.546
There's about 50 of us.

01:18:42.629 --> 01:18:44.671
We work together to survive.

01:18:44.754 --> 01:18:47.796
It's safe, always room for one more.

01:18:49.420 --> 01:18:50.504
Leora likes it here.

01:18:55.379 --> 01:18:57.046
Do you expect her back tonight?

01:18:58.462 --> 01:19:00.504
Okay I have to ask,

01:19:00.587 --> 01:19:02.420
how is it your generator still has juice

01:19:02.504 --> 01:19:04.671
in it after all these years?

01:19:04.754 --> 01:19:06.838
I mean, I thought all the
solar panels burnt out,

01:19:06.921 --> 01:19:08.504
during the storm.

01:19:08.587 --> 01:19:09.420
Hey,

01:19:12.379 --> 01:19:14.130
you don't look happy.

01:19:15.420 --> 01:19:17.462
I want you to be happy.

01:19:20.171 --> 01:19:21.004
I'm happy.

01:19:22.462 --> 01:19:25.629
Happy that I'm at the best
restaurant of the trip.

01:19:28.838 --> 01:19:31.255
Look, don't worry, the lights stay on.

01:19:32.754 --> 01:19:34.587
We have a portable fusion generator.

01:19:36.295 --> 01:19:38.255
This is fusion energy?

01:19:41.046 --> 01:19:42.879
You could power a whole goddamn city.

01:19:44.213 --> 01:19:47.712
A city, at full capacity
for one 1,321 days.

01:19:52.088 --> 01:19:53.337
That was the idea anyway.

01:19:54.337 --> 01:19:57.004
How the hell did you get your
hands on a fusion generator?

01:19:58.587 --> 01:20:00.088
What was it that took you 20 miles away,

01:20:00.171 --> 01:20:01.255
from all that safety?

01:20:02.754 --> 01:20:03.963
Hunting.

01:20:04.046 --> 01:20:06.088
We were running low on food.

01:20:06.171 --> 01:20:06.963
Well, if you're low on food,

01:20:07.046 --> 01:20:09.379
doesn't make much sense if
we joined you now, does it?

01:20:09.462 --> 01:20:11.921
No, we weren't meant to live like this.

01:20:12.004 --> 01:20:16.754
Maybe this is exactly
how we were meant to live.

01:20:16.838 --> 01:20:17.671
Which part?

01:20:19.295 --> 01:20:20.295
The riots?

01:20:21.254 --> 01:20:23.088
Chaos consuming humanity?

01:20:23.171 --> 01:20:24.546
Children dying in the darkness?

01:20:41.963 --> 01:20:44.088
We need to get back home and
tell Marcus and the others

01:20:44.171 --> 01:20:45.254
what we found.

01:20:49.546 --> 01:20:50.462
Maya, Maya.

01:20:52.171 --> 01:20:54.088
- Val, my leg is fucked!
- Wait...

01:20:56.754 --> 01:20:58.254
Sweetheart, don't tap the glass,

01:20:58.337 --> 01:21:00.504
you're gonna scare them.

01:21:00.587 --> 01:21:02.004
Listen to me,

01:21:02.088 --> 01:21:04.629
we're not leaving here
without his generator.

01:21:04.713 --> 01:21:07.254
This was just a recon run.

01:21:07.337 --> 01:21:08.629
Till it wasn't.

01:21:08.713 --> 01:21:10.838
Maya, Maya.

01:21:12.713 --> 01:21:13.546
He'll kill us.

01:21:18.005 --> 01:21:19.587
Not if we kill him first.

01:21:20.754 --> 01:21:21.754
Open your eyes.

01:21:22.921 --> 01:21:24.671
Does it look like a little girl...

01:21:41.671 --> 01:21:42.504
Don't leave.

01:21:44.212 --> 01:21:45.796
I'll make us some dandelion tea.

01:22:12.838 --> 01:22:14.963
Let the gun slide down your shoulder

01:22:15.046 --> 01:22:17.838
and onto the floor, nice and easy.

01:22:30.005 --> 01:22:30.838
Back up.

01:22:33.254 --> 01:22:34.671
Val, pick it up.

01:22:37.588 --> 01:22:39.754
Pick it up!

01:22:46.546 --> 01:22:47.713
Where's your generator?

01:22:49.963 --> 01:22:50.796
You lied to me.

01:22:51.921 --> 01:22:53.921
You woulda rushed us
out of here if I didn't.

01:22:54.005 --> 01:22:56.546
Sweetheart careful, don't tap the glass,

01:22:56.629 --> 01:22:57.838
you're gonna scare them.

01:22:58.754 --> 01:23:00.005
I don't know what you're doing,

01:23:00.088 --> 01:23:01.838
but say anything other than follow me

01:23:01.921 --> 01:23:04.546
and I blow your fucking
balls off, one at a time!

01:23:10.379 --> 01:23:11.212
Follow me.

01:23:26.129 --> 01:23:27.671
My name is Isaac

01:23:27.754 --> 01:23:29.588
and I'm very happy to
have you here with me.

01:23:29.671 --> 01:23:32.379
I don't give a shit what
your name is, keep walking.

01:23:47.045 --> 01:23:48.296
What is this?

01:23:49.796 --> 01:23:52.421
I'm taking you to see Leora.

01:23:57.254 --> 01:24:00.504
Three years since our
last generator died.

01:24:00.588 --> 01:24:02.963
Three years living the dark.

01:24:03.963 --> 01:24:06.045
Praying to an empty godless sky.

01:24:07.629 --> 01:24:09.005
Praying we'd find a way out.

01:24:10.254 --> 01:24:12.337
Praying we'd find you.

01:24:15.713 --> 01:24:16.838
That's it.

01:24:16.921 --> 01:24:18.254
I'm quitting life.

01:24:18.337 --> 01:24:21.087
I'm gonna stay here with you
forever, this is paradise.

01:24:22.005 --> 01:24:22.963
Get on your knees.

01:24:23.045 --> 01:24:23.880
Maya,

01:24:25.754 --> 01:24:27.421
no one needs to die here today.

01:24:28.963 --> 01:24:31.921
Sometimes, someone needs to die.

01:24:51.171 --> 01:24:52.004
Thank you.

01:24:58.045 --> 01:24:59.129
Maya, Maya.

01:25:08.379 --> 01:25:09.463
I'm so sorry.

01:25:18.921 --> 01:25:20.713
Don't keep Leora waiting.

01:26:12.087 --> 01:26:14.004
Beautiful, isn't she?

01:26:18.004 --> 01:26:21.212
Can you imagine
waking up to this everyday?

01:26:21.296 --> 01:26:23.880
I'm staying here with you forever.

01:26:27.796 --> 01:26:29.296
Sweetheart,
careful, don't tap the glass.

01:26:29.379 --> 01:26:30.504
You're gonna scare them.

01:26:32.212 --> 01:26:34.421
Can you imagine waking
up to this every day?

01:26:34.504 --> 01:26:37.254
God, this place is incredible.

01:26:37.337 --> 01:26:40.796
That's it, I'm staying
here with you now forever.

01:26:40.879 --> 01:26:42.629
You're stuck with me.

01:26:42.713 --> 01:26:44.879
This place is paradise.

01:26:46.129 --> 01:26:49.004
Can you imagine waking
up to this every day?

01:26:49.087 --> 01:26:51.671
God, this place is incredible.

01:26:51.755 --> 01:26:56.004
That's it, I'm staying
here with you now forever.

01:26:56.087 --> 01:26:57.838
You're stuck with me.

01:26:59.338 --> 01:27:00.171
Please,

01:27:03.671 --> 01:27:04.504
let me go.

01:27:18.796 --> 01:27:23.379
Tell me you're having so much fun here.

01:27:27.879 --> 01:27:29.463
I'm having so much fun here.

01:27:31.504 --> 01:27:33.421
No, you didn't mean that.

01:27:37.713 --> 01:27:39.463
You didn't mean that.

01:27:40.796 --> 01:27:43.129
Mean what you say!

01:27:48.962 --> 01:27:50.671
I'm having so much fun here.

01:27:52.630 --> 01:27:53.962
It was a beautiful day.

01:27:56.171 --> 01:27:57.212
We went for a walk.

01:27:59.755 --> 01:28:00.879
Just goddamn it!

01:28:00.962 --> 01:28:03.671
Just, please, just let me go!

01:28:03.755 --> 01:28:08.504
Tell me you wanna quit your
life and stay here with me.

01:28:13.879 --> 01:28:14.713
No,

01:28:18.379 --> 01:28:19.463
you could help people.

01:28:21.795 --> 01:28:23.837
You're sitting on fusion energy.

01:28:25.421 --> 01:28:27.171
You could rebuild this world.

01:28:29.546 --> 01:28:31.755
But instead you just, you hide.

01:28:33.837 --> 01:28:35.795
You hide in here behind a screen.

01:28:35.879 --> 01:28:36.921
You're pathetic.

01:28:39.504 --> 01:28:40.754
No different from how all of you acted,

01:28:40.837 --> 01:28:42.795
before the world went to shit.

01:28:45.129 --> 01:28:49.713
So you don't get to judge me.

01:28:52.046 --> 01:28:52.921
You live out there in the dark

01:28:53.004 --> 01:28:56.004
but you don't know what
real darkness looks like.

01:29:01.004 --> 01:29:02.338
Where's Leora?

01:29:06.837 --> 01:29:08.546
The real Leora.

01:29:12.171 --> 01:29:13.087
How'd she die?

01:29:15.129 --> 01:29:16.046
She get sick?

01:29:18.213 --> 01:29:20.546
She go out on a food
run and never come back?

01:29:23.004 --> 01:29:24.421
Did she die here?

01:29:27.296 --> 01:29:29.463
She died here, didn't she?

01:29:31.129 --> 01:29:32.129
She killed herself?

01:29:35.546 --> 01:29:36.962
She killed herself, didn't she?

01:29:40.296 --> 01:29:41.546
Please, my son.

01:29:43.421 --> 01:29:45.837
My son Ethan was two during the riots.

01:29:45.921 --> 01:29:48.421
They shot him in his leg.

01:29:49.505 --> 01:29:52.546
He bled out right in my arms
and he just, he held my hand.

01:29:53.837 --> 01:29:56.671
He held my hand and he had
the softest little hands.

01:29:56.754 --> 01:29:58.754
And he was always happy.

01:30:00.296 --> 01:30:03.129
He was always happy, even in the end.

01:30:05.213 --> 01:30:06.879
He was always happy.

01:31:24.505 --> 01:31:27.338
Leora, she was the one who...

01:31:34.962 --> 01:31:35.796
Wait!

01:31:39.088 --> 01:31:39.921
Wait,

01:31:42.505 --> 01:31:43.338
wait.

01:31:51.046 --> 01:31:54.129
You don't wanna end up like your son.

01:31:55.296 --> 01:31:56.879
I don't have a son.

01:31:58.004 --> 01:31:59.254
I made all that up.
