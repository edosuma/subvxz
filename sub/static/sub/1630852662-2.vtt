00:06.136 --> 00:09.879
<i>- When the cold</i>
<i>comes for you,</i>

00:09.922 --> 00:12.577
<i>the blood stops running</i>
<i>to your limbs.</i>

00:12.621 --> 00:15.972
<i>It pulls up inside</i>
<i>to keep your organs warm.</i>

00:17.582 --> 00:19.323
<i>- My first love</i>
<i>told me that.</i>

00:19.367 --> 00:21.151
<i>An off-shore roughnecker,</i>
<i>he was.</i>

00:21.195 --> 00:24.546
<i>Tall and lean</i>
<i>and tough as wet leather.</i>

00:24.589 --> 00:28.202
<i>He'd say, "Ruthie,</i>
<i>your smile keeps me warm,</i>

00:28.245 --> 00:30.291
<i>so be sure to wear it</i>
<i>till I'm home."</i>

01:29.176 --> 01:32.135
<i>Next, the cold comes</i>
<i>for your mind.</i>

01:33.310 --> 01:35.443
<i>And after that, your will.</i>

01:37.271 --> 01:41.318
<i>And yet, still,</i>
<i>the heart fights on.</i>

02:28.235 --> 02:29.932
Ruth.

02:37.287 --> 02:40.421
- She says Wilford's
up to something in back.

03:07.665 --> 03:10.059
- Big day, friends.
- Big day, sir.

03:10.102 --> 03:12.192
Everything's ready
for the test.

03:12.235 --> 03:15.630
- Dear, poor Dr. Headwood,
how are you doing without

03:15.673 --> 03:17.327
our dear, poor Dr. Headwood?

03:17.371 --> 03:20.112
- I feel
he's still with us, sir.

03:20.156 --> 03:23.551
- Are you confident here
in his shoes, as it were?

03:23.594 --> 03:25.030
100%, sir.

03:25.074 --> 03:26.815
- Yes, how is this
for the occasion?

03:26.858 --> 03:28.382
It's very Manhattan Project.

03:28.425 --> 03:30.035
Fine. Fine.

03:30.079 --> 03:33.822
Put down your lint brush,
and hand me my towel.

03:33.865 --> 03:36.390
- Pardon me.
Much to do!

03:36.433 --> 03:38.783
Thank you.

03:42.134 --> 03:45.790
<i>- He left me too soon,</i>
<i>my roughneck love.</i>

03:45.834 --> 03:48.140
<i>His rig went down</i>
<i>with every man aboard.</i>

03:51.318 --> 03:56.192
<i>I know my smile kept him warm</i>
<i>as he floated, all alone.</i>

03:56.236 --> 04:00.631
<i>Just as I know our hearts</i>
<i>will be the last thing to go</i>

04:00.675 --> 04:05.288
<i>on Wilford's train,</i>
<i>1,023 cars long.</i>

04:42.369 --> 04:44.458
- She's dehydrated,
malnourished,

04:44.501 --> 04:46.634
her blood pressure's low.

04:46.677 --> 04:50.028
She's probably got
radiation poisoning, so...

04:50.072 --> 04:53.989
- Hey. You wanna talk about
what happened out there?

04:54.032 --> 04:56.426
- Yeah, well,
you two almost died.

04:56.470 --> 04:58.689
No, when we kissed.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.953
I got a baby on the way, and I
made a promise to Zarah I'd--

05:01.997 --> 05:03.085
- Yeah, I don't need to talk
about it, no.

05:03.128 --> 05:04.304
Yeah, no, me either.

05:05.653 --> 05:07.132
Ben's got the data.

05:07.176 --> 05:08.830
Should we see
if it's all been worth it?

05:08.873 --> 05:10.048
Yeah. Yes.

05:15.793 --> 05:17.969
- I still don't get how
it's possible to survive

05:18.013 --> 05:20.015
eight years out there.

05:20.058 --> 05:22.365
Well, you freeze yourself in,

05:22.409 --> 05:25.542
live off the residual power
as the reactor cools.

05:25.586 --> 05:27.327
It's kind of genius
if you ask me.

05:27.370 --> 05:28.458
It's not even why you went

05:28.502 --> 05:29.720
out there in the first place.

05:29.764 --> 05:31.287
No.

05:33.942 --> 05:35.726
We have our results.

05:35.770 --> 05:38.120
Guessing that grimace
isn't just from the ribs.

05:38.163 --> 05:40.209
More of the same.

05:40.252 --> 05:43.430
Analysis shows the location
is warming, but the trend

05:43.473 --> 05:44.474
isn't steep enough

05:44.518 --> 05:45.606
to be habitable yet.

05:45.649 --> 05:47.303
How long are we talking Ben?

05:47.347 --> 05:48.783
A century?

05:48.826 --> 05:50.262
Give or take.

05:50.306 --> 05:53.396
- Oh, that's 0 for 5
on this milk run.

05:53.440 --> 05:55.398
- Okay, that leaves
one more location--

05:55.442 --> 05:57.052
your Arabian warm spot.

05:57.095 --> 05:59.794
- Yeah, from all the data
we've collected so far,

05:59.837 --> 06:01.752
it looks actually
pretty promising.

06:01.796 --> 06:06.017
Located here, Horn of Africa,
southern Arabian peninsula.

06:06.061 --> 06:07.628
- We haven't got enough food
to get there, Ben.

06:07.671 --> 06:09.238
We've got another mouth
to feed now.

06:09.281 --> 06:11.327
- It's time to go
get our train back.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.068
We find them,
we reconnect to the train,

06:13.111 --> 06:15.113
we lead everybody
to the new hot spot.

06:15.157 --> 06:16.811
- I'm far less concerned
with taking her

06:16.854 --> 06:18.552
- than I am with keeping her.
- Yeah, she's right.

06:18.595 --> 06:20.684
we're going back empty-handed.

06:20.728 --> 06:22.120
No proof of New Eden.

06:22.164 --> 06:24.035
- No Melanie.
- We're not empty-handed.

06:28.039 --> 06:29.650
Far from it.

06:33.697 --> 06:34.785
Hey.

06:40.095 --> 06:42.576
Come on. Hey.

06:42.619 --> 06:45.317
Whoa, okay.
No, no, it's okay. It's okay.

06:45.361 --> 06:47.319
I got it, I got it.
No, you're all right.

06:47.363 --> 06:48.886
Hey. You're all right,
you're all right.

06:48.930 --> 06:51.193
Look, you don't need
the suit here. You see?

06:52.847 --> 06:54.631
It's all right. Yeah.

06:57.678 --> 06:58.679
Uh, hi.

06:58.722 --> 07:00.463
My name's Andre Layton.

07:00.507 --> 07:04.206
We kinda met already,
fighting in the nuclear plant.

07:04.249 --> 07:06.730
Do you remember that?

07:06.774 --> 07:08.210
I'm sorry,
do you speak English?

07:08.253 --> 07:09.777
Yeah?

07:13.041 --> 07:14.172
Here.

07:18.220 --> 07:19.569
Okay.

07:22.790 --> 07:26.881
All right? What's your name?

07:26.924 --> 07:30.319
- Asha.
- Asha? Great.

07:31.494 --> 07:33.453
Don't worry, you're safe here.

07:33.496 --> 07:36.978
No one's going to hurt you.
You're on Snowpiercer.

07:37.021 --> 07:39.589
Snowpiercer?

07:39.633 --> 07:41.461
Am I dreaming?

07:41.504 --> 07:43.637
Not unless we all are.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.856
- The train survived?
- Let me show you.

07:45.900 --> 07:47.292
Can you walk?

07:52.080 --> 07:53.734
Just up here.

07:56.867 --> 07:58.347
Who the hell is that?

07:58.390 --> 07:59.957
- You lost the privilege
to ask questions.

08:00.001 --> 08:02.090
- Oh, come on, Bess.
Were they outside?

08:02.133 --> 08:04.527
- How's your head?
I bet it hurts.

08:04.571 --> 08:06.921
- Not as bad as when
you broke my nose.

08:08.444 --> 08:11.229
- Where's Mr. Wilford,
the Great Engineer?

08:11.273 --> 08:14.015
- Yeah, we don't really know.
There's two trains now.

08:14.058 --> 08:15.930
- There's a woman
in a cage down there.

08:15.973 --> 08:17.714
- Yeah, it's a long,
complicated story.

08:17.758 --> 08:19.455
And you've got one too,
and I want to hear it,

08:19.499 --> 08:20.978
but it's better
to take one thing

08:21.022 --> 08:23.067
at a time right now, trust me.

08:23.111 --> 08:24.678
- Why should I trust
any of this?

08:34.122 --> 08:35.906
Welcome aboard, Asha.

08:59.539 --> 09:02.019
- 10% should give us
a nice jolt.

09:02.063 --> 09:03.368
Nothing too lethal.

09:03.412 --> 09:05.327
- An appropriate test level,
sir.

09:05.370 --> 09:07.503
And the decommissioned
First Class cars

09:07.547 --> 09:10.811
should provide the necessary
buffer from the EMP pulse.

09:10.854 --> 09:13.727
- Well, let's hear
her sing, Kevin.

09:13.770 --> 09:15.598
Commence trial at 10%.

09:16.730 --> 09:18.253
Confirm 10%.

09:18.296 --> 09:20.342
Initiate countdown.

09:20.385 --> 09:22.562
- Initiate countdown.
We're all clear.

09:23.171 --> 09:25.390
Initiating countdown.

09:25.434 --> 09:26.435
Two minutes.

09:35.183 --> 09:37.794
- I brought
your little friend back.

09:40.057 --> 09:41.711
There you go.

09:43.104 --> 09:46.107
Should we get out of here?

09:56.247 --> 09:59.773
I'd wager that it's a weapon.

09:59.816 --> 10:01.296
It's set in the very last car,

10:01.339 --> 10:04.952
right where the trains
need to reconnect.

10:04.995 --> 10:08.042
Sure it's not just a heater?

10:08.085 --> 10:11.523
- All right?

10:12.133 --> 10:14.614
Yes, thanks. Just cold.

10:16.703 --> 10:20.054
- That's why you can't be
running around out there.

10:20.097 --> 10:21.664
Can't afford to lose you.

10:21.708 --> 10:25.059
- I'm no use to anyone
hiding in a hole, am I?

10:32.806 --> 10:36.287
And in five, four,

10:36.331 --> 10:39.987
three, two...

11:15.413 --> 11:17.633
It's all right.

11:19.548 --> 11:21.289
What was that?

11:21.332 --> 11:23.987
Felt like some electrical
wave went through me.

11:26.424 --> 11:28.513
Then that was the thing.

11:32.953 --> 11:34.432
Whoo hoo!

11:34.476 --> 11:37.784
- Well done, Kevin.
Well done, crew.

11:37.827 --> 11:40.003
Yes!

12:19.956 --> 12:24.221
- Oz, what's going on?
- Just--just give me a second.

12:24.265 --> 12:26.441
I wanna...

12:26.484 --> 12:29.139
I wanna remember this.

12:35.624 --> 12:40.803
LJ, it's a mean, old world.

12:40.847 --> 12:44.764
But with you in it,
it finally makes sense.

12:46.156 --> 12:48.985
- Lilah Junior,
will you marry me?

12:49.029 --> 12:51.335
- Holy shit!
That rock is huge!

12:51.379 --> 12:53.903
- I know.
It's actually crazy.

12:53.947 --> 12:55.513
It's probably the biggest
diamond left in the world,

12:55.557 --> 12:57.124
and all it cost me
was a pair of heavy socks.

12:57.167 --> 12:59.735
- Put it on me!
- You've got to say yes first.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.998
Yes! Yes!

13:06.481 --> 13:10.311
I didn't think anyone would
love me after my parents died.

13:10.354 --> 13:13.836
- I know, baby, I know.

13:13.880 --> 13:16.447
We have to tell Wilford.

13:16.491 --> 13:19.450
- Really?
- Yes! Out of respect.

13:19.494 --> 13:21.539
He's the closest thing
I have to family.

13:21.583 --> 13:25.282
I mean, after you, you know?

13:25.326 --> 13:27.023
Okay.

13:28.503 --> 13:31.114
- Lilah Junior
and Mr. Osweiller

13:31.158 --> 13:33.856
- are here to see you.
- Oh, bring them in.

13:33.900 --> 13:36.990
- He's wearing a tie.
- Hmm?

13:38.382 --> 13:40.863
My young denizens
of the Nightcar.

13:40.907 --> 13:42.647
Could we, uh...

13:42.691 --> 13:43.866
could we have a word
in private?

13:43.910 --> 13:45.389
- We're getting married!
- What?

13:45.433 --> 13:46.738
- We wanted you to be
the first to know.

13:46.782 --> 13:49.480
LJ, my dear, what a surprise.

13:49.524 --> 13:51.526
Very wise
to put such a nice ring

13:51.569 --> 13:53.441
on a her finger, Mr. Osweiller.

13:53.484 --> 13:56.052
When was the last time
we had a wedding?

13:56.096 --> 13:57.445
This is quite the occasion.

13:57.488 --> 13:59.490
Perhaps just the occasion
the train needs.

13:59.534 --> 14:02.102
- Oh, no, we're not expecting
anything--we don't need it.

14:02.145 --> 14:04.017
- I am.
- Well, you should, my dear.

14:04.060 --> 14:06.454
Life's been so bloody dreary
this leg.

14:06.497 --> 14:08.543
We'll give everyone
a shift off.

14:08.586 --> 14:11.894
Let's remind all the grumblers
what unity looks like,

14:11.938 --> 14:15.593
that we're all in this together
and loyalty is rewarded.

14:15.637 --> 14:16.943
What do you think?

14:16.986 --> 14:18.858
- Well, we could all use
a little respite,

14:18.901 --> 14:22.513
- maybe an extra ration or two--
- Wonderful, tomorrow then.

14:22.557 --> 14:24.385
- Tomorrow?
- Yeah, why not?

14:24.428 --> 14:26.169
No time for cold feet.

14:26.213 --> 14:28.084
We'll transform
the Nightcar, LJ.

14:28.128 --> 14:30.608
Or should I say Mrs. Osweiller?

14:30.652 --> 14:32.697
- Oh, Folger-Osweiller?

14:32.741 --> 14:34.656
- Um--
- Rolls off the tongue.

14:34.699 --> 14:37.833
I'm seeing red velvet, layers.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.444
Zarah, go see the Cakemaker.

14:40.488 --> 14:42.272
- You put the Cakemaker
in compost.

14:42.316 --> 14:44.405
- Then get him out.
We're getting married!

14:48.409 --> 14:51.891
- Get him a shower and anything
he needs from the bakery, okay?

14:51.934 --> 14:53.936
Thank you. Thank you.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.991
- What the hell
are you doing here?

15:05.034 --> 15:07.950
- Wilford's building a weapon.
You know anything about that?

15:07.994 --> 15:10.431
- I know he's up to something,
but no.

15:10.474 --> 15:12.868
- Well,
Ruth saw Javi working on it,

15:12.912 --> 15:14.957
so she wants to make contact
with him.

15:15.001 --> 15:17.699
- I told you guys,
Javi won't talk to me.

15:17.742 --> 15:20.049
He hasn't been the same
since that dog attack.

15:21.790 --> 15:23.400
Well, we all got scars.

15:23.444 --> 15:26.751
It's Ruth call.
if she wants to see him.

15:35.499 --> 15:37.066
Hitting the monitor

15:37.110 --> 15:40.548
does not tend to affect
the satellite's geosync.

15:40.591 --> 15:42.332
- What it does do
is make me feel better

15:42.376 --> 15:44.900
that they're all
falling out of orbit.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.163
How do you find a needle
in a haystack, Ben?

15:47.207 --> 15:49.122
- Thank God
it's only a haystack.

15:49.165 --> 15:51.515
You have any theories?

15:51.559 --> 15:54.518
- I have one theory.
- That he's following us?

15:56.172 --> 15:58.958
That's a pretty good
psychological assumption.

16:01.221 --> 16:04.354
If he is following us,

16:04.398 --> 16:06.922
we're back on the main line
in a day or so.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.402
As we came through here,

16:08.445 --> 16:10.447
our satellite coverage
improved.

16:10.491 --> 16:12.797
Maybe we see him there.

16:12.841 --> 16:14.408
And he sees us?

16:16.018 --> 16:17.411
Your mom would be proud

16:17.454 --> 16:19.979
of how you handled
the train yesterday.

16:20.022 --> 16:22.546
- I don't really think so, Ben,
but thank you.

16:22.590 --> 16:26.289
Alex, we found a survivor.

16:26.333 --> 16:28.726
Maybe we can hope
for a miracle.

16:30.206 --> 16:31.991
She's gone.

16:32.034 --> 16:36.560
Ben, it's all right.

17:10.855 --> 17:12.118
Hey.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.556
Tell me who she is.

17:18.385 --> 17:21.562
At least tell me
what you're looking for.

17:40.450 --> 17:42.496
What did you find?

17:58.686 --> 18:00.557
Just, uh, in here.

18:03.604 --> 18:05.954
I've made it up for you.

18:08.522 --> 18:11.525
It's, uh, it's so warm.

18:14.441 --> 18:15.572
Thank you, uh...

18:15.616 --> 18:16.965
Josie.

18:17.008 --> 18:19.010
Josie, Josie.

18:19.054 --> 18:22.884
I'm sorry, it's been a long
time since I even spoke.

18:22.927 --> 18:25.016
- Sorry?
It'll all come back.

18:27.236 --> 18:30.109
You made it.
I mean, wow.

18:32.154 --> 18:34.896
You all right?

19:19.723 --> 19:21.508
Hey.

19:23.205 --> 19:26.077
You all right?

19:26.121 --> 19:28.689
- How close you ever come
to freezing to death?

19:29.907 --> 19:33.346
- Uh...I guess no less
than most of us.

19:34.260 --> 19:36.784
Is it like they say?

19:36.827 --> 19:39.352
Yeah.

19:39.395 --> 19:43.443
You start to relax,
it goes warm, you see things.

19:43.486 --> 19:47.925
- Mm-hmm, okay.
Like, uh, trees?

19:47.969 --> 19:50.928
Dragon's Blood Tree.

19:50.972 --> 19:53.235
Grass.

19:53.279 --> 19:55.890
I could feel the sun.

19:56.847 --> 19:59.067
It was the place
we're looking for.

20:00.590 --> 20:03.071
- Yeah, well, I'm glad you
came back, 'cause it wasn't.

20:03.114 --> 20:06.814
- No, look, these trees only
grow in the Gulf of Aden,

20:06.857 --> 20:10.252
tight here in the middle
of our Arabian warm spot.

20:11.993 --> 20:15.126
I'd never even heard of
a Dragon's Blood Tree before.

20:15.170 --> 20:17.172
But I saw it.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.609
- Are you saying
you had a vision?

20:19.653 --> 20:21.916
- I'm just telling you
what happened.

20:21.959 --> 20:23.526
- You tell anyone else?
- No.

20:23.570 --> 20:25.746
Good. Keep it on the rails.

20:25.789 --> 20:29.445
You had a close call, something
popped out of your memory,

20:29.489 --> 20:32.753
some tree you learned about
in high school.

20:34.624 --> 20:37.410
- Yeah. Yeah, you're
probably right. Thanks.

20:37.453 --> 20:39.673
Yeah. Okay.

20:39.716 --> 20:42.371
Another day, another
near-death experience, right?

20:42.415 --> 20:45.722
- Okay. Love you, buddy.

20:45.766 --> 20:47.158
Yeah.

21:00.868 --> 21:02.261
- We're on a different
attack today, Kevin,

21:02.304 --> 21:05.307
a charm offensive.
What do you think?

21:05.351 --> 21:07.744
Too much red?

21:07.788 --> 21:11.487
- Never enough red, sir.
- I agree.

21:13.315 --> 21:15.839
- Why'd you say that?
- Say what?

21:17.363 --> 21:20.496
- What?
- Folger-Osweiller.

21:20.540 --> 21:21.976
I just said it.

21:22.019 --> 21:23.891
I didn't know he'd put it
on the register.

21:23.934 --> 21:25.675
- Yeah, well,
it's his wedding now.

21:25.719 --> 21:27.895
- I knew he'd do this.
- So what?

21:27.938 --> 21:30.332
We get to be king and queen
of everything for a day.

21:30.376 --> 21:34.380
- He's using us, LJ.
- He's investing in us.

21:34.423 --> 21:36.817
- I would've been very happy
with something small.

21:36.860 --> 21:38.297
Sing you a song,
just a few of us.

21:38.340 --> 21:40.037
But that wasn't on the table,
was it?

21:40.081 --> 21:41.952
- Yeah, because
we don't have any friends.

21:41.996 --> 21:43.519
I want to be in a power couple.

21:43.563 --> 21:45.434
We could run
this train one day.

21:45.478 --> 21:48.045
- LJ, Jesus.
- What?

21:48.089 --> 21:49.438
Old people keep dying off,

21:49.482 --> 21:51.135
there's barely any
young people left,

21:51.179 --> 21:53.268
and soon
we'll have to rule them.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.662
It's our wedding day.

21:55.705 --> 21:59.405
Do you ever stop conniving?

21:59.448 --> 22:02.146
- Conniving is good.
- Fine! Connive away!

22:02.190 --> 22:04.061
It's too late
to call it off now,

22:04.105 --> 22:06.673
because Wilford would have my
head out a port, wouldn't he?

22:06.716 --> 22:09.240
Don't walk away from me!

22:11.591 --> 22:13.070
Oz?

22:31.306 --> 22:33.003
Javi?

22:44.580 --> 22:46.190
Javi?

22:48.062 --> 22:50.499
You can talk to me,
no one is here.

22:56.549 --> 22:59.029
Engineer Wilford
wants you down in First.

22:59.073 --> 23:01.292
- But I'm on shift.
- I don't know.

23:01.336 --> 23:02.859
That's what he wants.

23:02.903 --> 23:05.688
So put it on autopilot,
and off you go.

23:20.486 --> 23:24.098
- You look beautiful.
It's your big day.

23:24.141 --> 23:26.056
Would you just leave it?

23:26.100 --> 23:28.145
I don't care if it looks
like shit, just leave it.

23:28.189 --> 23:30.539
- Oh, dear.
I heard the bride

23:30.583 --> 23:32.889
might be blue,
but blue in the face?

23:32.933 --> 23:34.238
Excuse me.

23:34.282 --> 23:36.415
- Yes, that will be best,
thank you.

23:36.458 --> 23:39.853
<i>- Come now, here.</i>

23:39.896 --> 23:42.116
Now, tell me
what you fought about.

23:42.159 --> 23:44.031
"You're always conniving."

23:44.074 --> 23:46.468
He thinks I'm selfish
and I'm cruel.

23:46.512 --> 23:49.123
I have to be sometimes,
don't I?

23:49.166 --> 23:53.475
- It's why I wanted you
in the Nightcar, LJ.

23:53.519 --> 23:55.216
You're a realist.

23:55.259 --> 23:57.000
You understand
someone always gets hurt.

23:57.044 --> 23:59.655
- Yes, yes, it's like
I don't say it out loud,

23:59.699 --> 24:01.309
but c'est la vie.

24:01.352 --> 24:03.442
- He also probably thinks
I'm taking over

24:03.485 --> 24:05.226
the whole ceremony.

24:05.269 --> 24:06.532
Don't you understand

24:06.575 --> 24:10.013
why your wedding
is important to me.

24:10.057 --> 24:12.363
Helps keep everyone in line.

24:12.407 --> 24:14.235
Yes.

24:14.278 --> 24:17.281
They see there's only one way,
the way I do things.

24:17.325 --> 24:20.633
You see, on the train,
the old laws and morality,

24:20.676 --> 24:23.462
they don't matter as much as...

24:23.505 --> 24:26.290
what?

24:26.334 --> 24:28.031
- Loyalty.
- That's right!

24:28.075 --> 24:31.426
Loyalty to the train!

24:31.470 --> 24:35.125
Now, save the crocodile tears
for the ceremony.

24:35.169 --> 24:37.476
Make a show of it, for me!

24:38.564 --> 24:41.131
I will.

24:41.175 --> 24:42.611
See you soon.

24:53.013 --> 24:55.015
Lovely spot
for your wedding bed.

24:59.236 --> 25:01.717
- Thank you.
We did it ourselves.

25:02.849 --> 25:05.808
Come, sit down. Come on.

25:10.813 --> 25:14.513
The young, tumultuous love.
I know it well.

25:14.556 --> 25:19.343
Well, the tumultuous part,
not the young bit anymore.

25:19.387 --> 25:21.563
But LJ's upset.

25:21.607 --> 25:25.262
Yeah, well, it's, uh...

25:25.306 --> 25:29.005
pre-wedding jitters.
We'll be fine.

25:29.049 --> 25:30.659
Yeah.

25:30.703 --> 25:33.357
- Well, I am rather
protective of her.

25:33.401 --> 25:40.016
So, I had a long look at
Ms. Roche's personnel records.

25:40.060 --> 25:42.497
You were an opportunistic boy
in blue.

25:42.541 --> 25:46.022
- Well, I ran
a few side hustles, yes, sir.

25:46.066 --> 25:49.591
- Oh, an entrepreneur
with a vicious streak.

25:49.635 --> 25:52.376
Good qualities
in a Nightcar manager.

25:54.509 --> 25:59.383
And yet, these hands...

26:00.776 --> 26:03.823
Play piano so beautifully.

26:03.866 --> 26:07.653
Part of you just yearns
to be an artiste,

26:07.696 --> 26:10.394
warbling the saddest of songs.

26:11.744 --> 26:13.136
- I didn't grow up
in what you'd call

26:13.180 --> 26:16.662
a creative environment.

26:16.705 --> 26:19.665
You found your voice.

26:19.708 --> 26:23.973
Piano man and his ginger wife
behind the bar.

26:27.063 --> 26:29.544
You're my team here.

26:30.719 --> 26:34.070
We understand that. We do.

26:37.508 --> 26:41.338
- Your Brakeman shakedown move,
remember?

26:41.382 --> 26:44.254
Squeeze mine too. Go on.

26:44.298 --> 26:46.909
Squeeze them.

26:46.953 --> 26:49.216
Harder. Harder.

26:49.259 --> 26:51.958
Give them some basso profundo.

26:53.524 --> 26:58.268
Now, what are your hands for?
Hmm?

26:58.312 --> 26:59.661
Crushing balls.

27:05.711 --> 27:07.800
And caressing your wife.

27:16.939 --> 27:20.856
When that's done, by all means,
tickle the ivories.

27:24.207 --> 27:27.210
Because you're very talented.

27:27.254 --> 27:29.517
I mean that.

27:43.792 --> 27:45.141
Papers.

27:50.190 --> 27:52.192
Inside.

28:27.488 --> 28:30.404
- Mr. de la Torre?
Just me.

28:31.710 --> 28:34.147
Long time no see.

28:34.190 --> 28:37.237
- Ruth? But you're--
you're on the other train.

28:37.280 --> 28:38.760
- No, I've been here
the whole time,

28:38.804 --> 28:40.719
been helping the passengers,

28:40.762 --> 28:42.982
doing my bit
for our friends out there.

28:43.025 --> 28:45.114
You shouldn't be here.

28:47.290 --> 28:48.596
Oh, Javi.

28:48.639 --> 28:51.164
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No, no. Please.

28:53.993 --> 28:56.865
- Engineer, I just need
your help, please.

28:56.909 --> 28:58.954
The thing that you're working
on back there, what is it?

28:58.998 --> 29:00.956
What does it do?

29:01.000 --> 29:03.959
- It's going to stop
Layton dead.

29:04.003 --> 29:05.656
I need to go back
to the dog, I'm sorry.

29:05.700 --> 29:08.007
- Not yet.
Tell me how it works.

29:10.836 --> 29:12.315
- No.
- Javi.

29:12.359 --> 29:14.230
- No, no!
- Javi!

29:27.287 --> 29:29.419
Gorgeous.

29:42.911 --> 29:47.176
- Welcome, brave passengers,
workers all around.

29:47.220 --> 29:51.137
It's my great pleasure
to pause our labors

29:51.180 --> 29:56.925
and spend time in union,
the union today, by marriage,

29:56.969 --> 30:02.452
of Lilah Folger Junior
and John Cristopher Osweiller.

30:09.808 --> 30:14.464
<i>I know these have been</i>
<i>cold miles of deprivation.</i>

30:14.508 --> 30:17.816
<i>The discipline's harsh.</i>
<i>You've paid in frostbite</i>

30:17.859 --> 30:21.689
and loved ones lost
to influenza.

30:21.732 --> 30:24.387
May they rest in peace.

30:24.431 --> 30:27.869
So, it's time
we celebrate a win, isn't it?

30:32.134 --> 30:35.398
<i>Old world matrimony.</i>

30:35.442 --> 30:38.619
<i>Everyone, fill a glass.</i>
<i>There's enough for every soul.</i>

30:38.662 --> 30:41.100
<i>Extra hot food too.</i>

30:41.143 --> 30:43.145
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

30:43.189 --> 30:46.888
- Raise a glass up and down
our train for Lilah and John.

30:46.932 --> 30:49.586
Come on! Cheers!

30:52.807 --> 30:54.287
Everyone now,

30:54.330 --> 30:58.073
to our unbreakable pact
with the train.

30:58.117 --> 31:02.991
To loyalty
and your contract with me.

31:04.210 --> 31:05.515
To survive.

31:23.577 --> 31:26.536
- Sounds like an
electromagnetic pulse weapon.

31:26.580 --> 31:29.148
I've never actually seen
one before.

31:29.191 --> 31:32.586
- But do you know how it works?
- Yeah.

31:32.629 --> 31:34.631
It sends out
an electromagnetic pulse,

31:34.675 --> 31:37.983
killing all the electronics
on Snowpiercer,

31:38.026 --> 31:39.593
leaving Layton
dead in the water.

31:39.636 --> 31:41.421
- So while this wedding
is happening,

31:41.464 --> 31:43.684
let's try and make it
not do that.

31:43.727 --> 31:46.208
- You got a manual?
- Oh, come on, Lights,

31:46.252 --> 31:49.298
I told the lady that you're
good at this kind of thing.

31:49.342 --> 31:51.910
Disarming EMPs?

31:51.953 --> 31:54.347
Yeah.

32:08.796 --> 32:10.841
- Where you going, Javi?
- Back to the dog.

32:10.885 --> 32:14.671
- Ah, ah.
Where you coming from?

32:16.282 --> 32:19.676
- Final data collection.
Can I go?

32:21.026 --> 32:22.331
- Mm-hmm.

32:32.602 --> 32:34.213
Come with me.

32:38.434 --> 32:41.698
Follow me. You too.

32:44.049 --> 32:49.141
- Now, I ask you
to take the sacred steps

32:49.184 --> 32:52.318
in union with
the Eternal Engine.

32:53.623 --> 32:59.629
These four steps represent
the path humanity has taken.

33:02.154 --> 33:06.897
From grass...to ice...

33:06.941 --> 33:11.815
From ice to steel.

33:11.859 --> 33:15.645
- And from steel
to the light...

33:15.689 --> 33:17.778
of the Eternal Engine.

33:20.737 --> 33:22.348
Anyone come through here?

33:22.391 --> 33:24.263
- That dog-faced Engineer's
here all the time,

33:24.306 --> 33:26.134
but he's in and out.

33:26.178 --> 33:28.832
Well, we'll check it anyway.

33:28.876 --> 33:31.009
Wouldn't this wedding
be a great distraction

33:31.052 --> 33:32.314
for the enemy?

33:40.801 --> 33:42.933
- I have no idea
how to disarm this thing.

33:42.977 --> 33:44.674
Just start messing with it.

33:44.718 --> 33:46.502
- That's your plan?
- You're my plan.

33:49.984 --> 33:51.986
- Jackboots and Teal coming!
- What?

33:52.030 --> 33:53.335
- They'll pin us back here,
let's go!

33:53.379 --> 33:55.816
We got to go! Let's go!

33:55.859 --> 33:57.122
- Come on.
- No, no, no, no.

33:57.165 --> 33:58.297
You need to keep
working on it, Mr. Pike.

33:58.340 --> 34:00.429
What are you going to do?

34:00.473 --> 34:03.215
- I need to run interference,
or we'll all stuck back here.

34:03.258 --> 34:05.521
They won't keep coming
if they see me.

34:05.565 --> 34:08.698
Just disable it and give Layton
a fighting chance.

34:08.742 --> 34:11.092
- Ruth!
- That's an order, Mr. Pike!

34:12.528 --> 34:14.008
You're in charge now.

34:15.836 --> 34:17.272
I believe in you.

34:24.584 --> 34:26.455
- Congratulations.

34:31.025 --> 34:33.506
That's nice.

34:46.649 --> 34:47.998
You.

34:48.042 --> 34:50.131
Yes, Kevin, it's me.

34:50.175 --> 34:54.092
The one you've been looking
for all this time.

34:54.135 --> 34:57.007
Running round like a chicken
with your head cut off.

34:57.051 --> 34:59.097
Well, I'm surrendering.

34:59.140 --> 35:02.056
I'm cold, and I'm starving,
so come on.

35:02.100 --> 35:05.668
You'll get to be the hero
without ever lifting a finger.

35:07.366 --> 35:08.802
Take her.

35:34.480 --> 35:36.003
There were 34 of us to start,

35:36.046 --> 35:39.920
eking it out
on the plant's residual power.

35:39.963 --> 35:42.879
Career scientists.

35:42.923 --> 35:45.882
Foreign nuclear technicians
like me.

35:45.926 --> 35:48.058
Some of our families too.

35:52.237 --> 35:54.717
Marauders
killed about half of us

35:54.761 --> 35:56.241
before they died out,
and then--

35:56.284 --> 35:58.199
Marauders?

35:58.243 --> 36:01.202
- Then the cold and radiation
poisoning took the rest of us.

36:01.246 --> 36:04.640
My nephew, he was 15 years old.

36:04.684 --> 36:07.339
He was the last to go.

36:09.558 --> 36:12.344
He had thyroid cancer.

36:12.387 --> 36:18.045
By the end,
he was begging me to kill him.

36:18.088 --> 36:20.003
That was about four years ago.

36:20.047 --> 36:24.182
After that, yeah, I--

36:24.225 --> 36:26.271
I lost time.

36:26.314 --> 36:29.056
Stopped hoping,
stopped thinking.

36:29.099 --> 36:33.147
It's like someone
other than me lived down there.

36:35.454 --> 36:37.760
Then I turned my eyes on you.

36:37.804 --> 36:39.632
I hate to tell you this,

36:39.675 --> 36:43.070
but humankind hasn't exactly
evolved in your absence.

36:45.115 --> 36:49.990
- You pushed past what was
safe, even sane, to rescue me.

36:50.033 --> 36:51.818
Why?

36:56.039 --> 36:58.085
I'm just glad I did.

37:04.657 --> 37:06.267
We're still basically blind.

37:06.311 --> 37:08.182
- We had picture last time
we came out here.

37:08.226 --> 37:09.705
- The satellite's
continued to degrade.

37:09.749 --> 37:12.491
- Options?
- Wait, there's options?

37:12.534 --> 37:16.234
- We go back directly
to the main line

37:16.277 --> 37:19.411
where we either see physical
signs that are front of us,

37:19.454 --> 37:21.369
or we know they're behind us.

37:21.413 --> 37:23.371
Or we parallel the main line,

37:23.415 --> 37:25.373
hoping the signal
improves enough

37:25.417 --> 37:27.767
so we can glimpse them
on the sat.

37:29.203 --> 37:30.900
- Second route.
- Roger that.

37:42.912 --> 37:48.483
- And you picked that based
on what...another vision?

37:48.527 --> 37:50.920
- No, I mean,
there's got to be more options

37:50.964 --> 37:53.532
off the main line, right?

37:53.575 --> 37:55.316
Yeah.

38:55.245 --> 38:57.160
She sacrificed for us,

38:57.204 --> 38:58.597
so now we gotta
kill this thing, okay?

38:58.640 --> 39:00.381
- The laptop patches
in here...

39:00.425 --> 39:03.210
so we can't hack the software.

39:05.081 --> 39:08.824
Maybe we can disrupt
the power supply,

39:08.868 --> 39:10.086
mess with it.

39:14.047 --> 39:15.701
It's like an arming sequence.

39:23.883 --> 39:25.493
- It's live.
- Oh, shit!

39:27.800 --> 39:30.193
- I think it's at full pulse.
- Yeah, I can see that!

39:30.237 --> 39:31.978
I can't turn it down.

39:32.021 --> 39:33.762
It's not stopping.

39:36.983 --> 39:38.114
Oh.

39:44.556 --> 39:49.865
I knew it had to be someone
with acumen for rail logistics.

39:49.909 --> 39:51.693
But to be honest,
I'm more impressed

39:51.737 --> 39:55.697
with how low you went
to grovel it out in the bowels.

39:55.741 --> 39:58.744
- Well, I do try not
to disappoint, sir.

40:00.441 --> 40:02.748
If you'd only stayed loyal.

40:02.791 --> 40:05.968
I am loyal.

40:06.012 --> 40:07.709
To something bigger than you.

40:07.753 --> 40:09.929
You've got it all wrong,
Mr. Wilford.

40:09.972 --> 40:12.714
- I hear that all the time,
and then I win.

40:12.758 --> 40:14.977
Winning isn't leading.

40:15.021 --> 40:16.849
And loyalty isn't enough
on its own.

40:16.892 --> 40:19.155
It has to come with love.

40:19.199 --> 40:21.680
And not the kind
that you feed off.

40:21.723 --> 40:24.813
Unconditional love, sacrifice,
for each and every passenger.

40:24.857 --> 40:27.642
- Oh, God.
- You can't ignore love.

40:29.122 --> 40:32.081
You can't predict it either.

40:34.562 --> 40:36.129
- We got to get this thing
out that door.

40:36.172 --> 40:37.957
- We don't have any door codes
or breach suits.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.741
Uh, thinking, uh...

40:39.785 --> 40:43.092
Year two rebellion, they sealed
the subtrain doors on us,

40:43.136 --> 40:44.659
but we compromised the hinges.

40:44.703 --> 40:46.835
- Go!
- Here.

40:49.011 --> 40:52.188
- Strong Boy! Get ready!

40:57.977 --> 41:01.197
Okay, good, come on.
Let's go.

41:05.071 --> 41:06.507
Ready!

41:06.551 --> 41:10.642
- They're preparing the port
for you now.

41:10.685 --> 41:14.733
I'll make sure they mount
the cuff nice and high,

41:14.776 --> 41:17.213
where prosthetics
are impossible.

41:18.606 --> 41:21.304
Wouldn't wear one anyway.

41:26.222 --> 41:27.876
Come on. Got it? Okay, run.

41:27.920 --> 41:29.312
Run, sister, run!

41:36.581 --> 41:37.886
Go!

41:56.557 --> 41:59.821
- The irony is, I built
the ports in as an idle threat,

41:59.865 --> 42:02.563
never expected to use them.

42:02.607 --> 42:06.524
You did. 13 times.

42:10.223 --> 42:12.399
I'll pay my penance.

42:13.443 --> 42:15.794
You can have my arm.

42:47.695 --> 42:50.002
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

42:52.918 --> 42:55.050
- Wonder what on earth
could that be?

42:56.486 --> 42:58.140
Huh.

42:58.184 --> 43:01.579
- Electromagnetic?
- Triangulating.

43:01.622 --> 43:03.624
- Well, that's the signature,
it's got to be them.

43:03.668 --> 43:07.019
- Yes, it is.
520 kilometers west.

43:07.062 --> 43:08.586
They're on the main line.

43:08.629 --> 43:10.979
- That's a lot better
than seeing them on sat.

43:11.023 --> 43:14.461
- Yeah, it means
Wilford can't see us.

43:14.504 --> 43:17.812
- We've got the drop on him.
- Wilford hates surprises.

43:17.856 --> 43:19.858
Good.

43:19.901 --> 43:22.643
Let's go give him one.

43:47.494 --> 43:49.757
I built something for you.

43:52.281 --> 43:55.633
Something that would have
saved countless lives.

43:57.199 --> 44:00.028
We could've snuffed out
Layton's pirate train

44:00.072 --> 44:03.205
without firing a shot.

44:03.249 --> 44:07.732
Now, thanks to a rat

44:07.775 --> 44:11.126
found hiding in the pipes,

44:11.170 --> 44:15.827
when this war comes,
you're all going to bleed.

44:21.267 --> 44:24.444
It's back to broadswords
and shields because of you.

44:29.710 --> 44:31.669
Ready when you are, sir.

44:33.235 --> 44:35.107
Let's get it bloody off then.

45:02.482 --> 45:05.398
- They're back.
They're back.

45:19.804 --> 45:22.807
Battle stations!

45:22.850 --> 45:24.504
Go!

45:24.547 --> 45:26.767
Battle stations, you dogs!

45:26.811 --> 45:29.596
Come on!
