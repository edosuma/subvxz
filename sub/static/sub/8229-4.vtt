why this went wrong.

Far from the pin-point crash
they were after,

by over 50 feet.

But with both vehicles
comparatively undamaged...

did gain some lift,

21:31.900 --> 21:34.500
the mods
to the cars' hood heights...

were clearly not enough
to mirror the movie.

[ Tires screech ]

22:17.100 --> 22:19.066
While our first story
involved something

22:19.067 --> 22:20.832
that Hollywood
makes look difficult

22:20.833 --> 22:22.232
but which is in fact easy,

our second story
might be the other way around.

Try not to roll the car.

22:29.467 --> 22:30.932

22:30.933 --> 22:32.932
Picture our hero
being chased by the bad guys

22:32.933 --> 22:35.132
and cornered
with no line of escape

22:35.133 --> 22:37.399
except an alleyway
that is too narrow

He gets out by finding
a conveniently placed curb

to get up onto two wheels,

to escape,

22:49.767 --> 22:51.632

That actually sounds like
it might be pretty difficult.

[ Tires screech ]

23:00.367 --> 23:02.199

So, can a novice driver

23:02.200 --> 23:05.566
get up on two wheels
and crucially maintain balance

23:05.567 --> 23:08.566
as easily as Hollywood
would have us believe?

23:08.567 --> 23:10.099
[ Tires screech ]

23:10.100 --> 23:13.332
Or is it a disaster
waiting to happen?

23:13.333 --> 23:15.832
The most important component
of this myth is the car.

23:15.833 --> 23:17.099
[ Tires screech ]

23:17.100 --> 23:20.099
So, we've got a normal car
with normal tires

23:20.100 --> 23:21.766
and a normal suspension.

23:21.767 --> 23:23.666
Of course, we've added
a safety harness, though.

23:23.667 --> 23:25.132
The other important part
of this story

23:25.133 --> 23:26.599
is how to get the car
up on two wheels,

23:26.600 --> 23:28.066
and we're going to do that
with this,

23:28.067 --> 23:30.432
a ramp made
out of aircraft-grade aluminum,

23:30.433 --> 23:31.799
and it's solid as a rock.

23:31.800 --> 23:33.499
Hopefully,
if everything goes right,

23:33.500 --> 23:35.766
we should be hitting it
at about 20 miles an hour.

23:35.767 --> 23:36.799
Okay.

23:36.800 --> 23:38.832
Now,
because there's a genuine risk

23:38.833 --> 23:41.766
that we might
tip this car completely over,

23:41.767 --> 23:43.266
we've added a roll bar.

23:43.267 --> 23:45.866
I personally think
it'd be great to roll it,

23:45.867 --> 23:47.499
but they tell me that's bad.

23:47.500 --> 23:50.367
That looks beautiful.

23:51.667 --> 23:53.466
Narrator:
In tinseltown,

23:53.467 --> 23:57.066
any old curb or plank will
enable two-wheeled gymnastics.

23:57.067 --> 23:58.932
Adam:
Absolutely perfect.

23:58.933 --> 24:01.399
Narrator: But Adam and Jamie
have given the myth

24:01.400 --> 24:05.332
its best possible shot
with a long, gently sloping ramp

24:05.333 --> 24:09.167
high enough to tip the car
over its center of gravity.

24:10.467 --> 24:11.966

I've never done this before,

24:11.967 --> 24:14.166

it's going to be scary as heck

'cause I'm not used to it,
and it's going to feel like

24:16.767 --> 24:18.799
the car is going to tip
completely over.

from the top of the ramp...

This is terrifying.

to think too much about

of the novice movie maneuver.

that this myth

the ramp car even more

Now, back at the shop,
we took a corvette

28:16.400 --> 28:18.567
and we cut out the suspension...

28:19.667 --> 28:21.899
and we put super skinny tires
on it

the same as before,

we'll actually get a jump.

28:39.200 --> 28:40.532
the corvette more ramp-like,

but we're also going to
help along the mustang.

28:42.667 --> 28:44.066
We made it a lot lighter.

28:44.067 --> 28:47.499
It does not even have the weight
of the engine in it anymore.

is way jacked up.

when these two meet,

I think the problem is,

30:12.600 --> 30:16.832
this is like driving up a ramp
but hitting the curb first

30:16.833 --> 30:18.566

have to get over

in the front of the corvette.

We're getting more of a crash

30:50.867 --> 30:52.766
and less of a jump
like in the movie,

30:52.767 --> 30:55.499
and the reason why is because
when the two vehicles meet,

30:55.500 --> 30:58.132
their bumpers meet before
the wheel of the jump vehicle

30:58.133 --> 31:01.366

the hood of the ramp vehicle.

of a crash, less of a jump.

The way we're going to fix that
is with this.

31:06.933 --> 31:08.266
We're going to build a ramp,

is going to actually attach

31:10.867 --> 31:11.966

And it will move
towards the jump vehicle.

This way, the jump vehicle
will have a chance

31:16.567 --> 31:19.366
to transition its wheels
up onto the hood

31:19.367 --> 31:22.166

Go a little faster and the
rear wheel won't bump the ramp.

40:03.133 --> 40:05.366
Adam spends
the next four hours...

40:05.367 --> 40:07.999
Keep doing that
and just roll a little bit more.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.500
Failing to get it up.

40:12.833 --> 40:15.166
Jamie: What makes this stunt
so difficult

40:15.167 --> 40:17.999
is that while you can
work your way up incrementally

40:18.000 --> 40:19.567
to find the tipping point...

40:20.800 --> 40:22.399
That's it.

40:22.400 --> 40:24.666
Once you get there, well,
it's a tipping point.

40:24.667 --> 40:25.667
Adam: Whoa.

40:25.668 --> 40:26.932
[ Laughs ]

40:26.933 --> 40:28.899
You felt the danger
and you reacted, that's awesome.

40:28.900 --> 40:32.932
And if you go too far,
you roll the car.

40:32.933 --> 40:34.532
Yeah!

40:34.533 --> 40:36.166
Whoo!

40:36.167 --> 40:38.666
If you don't go far enough,
you come slamming back down

40:38.667 --> 40:40.499
and you get a neck ache
like I've got.

40:40.500 --> 40:42.099
Oh!

40:42.100 --> 40:44.132
Yeah!

40:44.133 --> 40:45.766
So the only way
you get past this

40:45.767 --> 40:47.599
is by doing it over and over

40:47.600 --> 40:50.066
until your reflexes
become automatic

40:50.067 --> 40:53.432
as to what you should do when
you're at that tipping point.

40:53.433 --> 40:54.599
Yep, keep into it.

40:54.600 --> 40:56.366
There you go.
There you go. There you go.

40:56.367 --> 40:58.966
Give it a little throttle.

40:58.967 --> 41:01.932
Whoa!

41:01.933 --> 41:05.132
Whoo! Yeah!
That's awesome.

41:05.133 --> 41:08.699
Narrator: At last,
Adam appears to have the hang

41:08.700 --> 41:10.767
of hanging around on two wheels.

41:13.533 --> 41:15.599
Whoa! Yeah!

41:15.600 --> 41:20.266
And being the obsessive
perfectionist that he is,

41:20.267 --> 41:22.933
he has to have
just one more try.

41:40.800 --> 41:43.832
Jamie: Dave, the medic,
please come down to the site.

41:43.833 --> 41:45.066
Dave: Copy.

41:45.067 --> 41:47.366
Adam:
We're okay. We're okay.

41:47.367 --> 41:49.332
We're upside down,
but we're okay.

41:49.333 --> 41:50.966
Oh!

41:50.967 --> 41:55.299
Okay, so i figured out
what the outer limit was.

41:55.300 --> 41:57.066
Don't release your belt
until you're ready

41:57.067 --> 41:58.167
because you'll fall.

42:00.900 --> 42:04.100
All right,
we're coming out. Ah!

42:08.267 --> 42:09.866
Ah!

42:09.867 --> 42:11.299
It's like giving birth.

42:11.300 --> 42:13.166
Ah. Hi.
[ Chuckles ]

42:13.167 --> 42:16.132
This is why
we can't have nice things.

42:16.133 --> 42:17.267
[ Laughter ]

42:20.900 --> 42:22.666
So, that happened.
[ Laughs ]

42:22.667 --> 42:25.399
I'm still a little bit high
on the adrenaline rush

42:25.400 --> 42:27.532
of the feeling like
"it's going okay,

42:27.533 --> 42:29.732
"it's going okay,
okay, it's not going okay.

42:29.733 --> 42:31.053
Okay,
it's really not going okay."

42:33.167 --> 42:35.666
And i got a little bit of a cut,
but I'm fine.

42:35.667 --> 42:36.700
That was awesome.

42:39.633 --> 42:42.066
Oh, that was awesome.

42:42.067 --> 42:44.199
Thank you, sir.

42:44.200 --> 42:45.532
[ Laughs ]

42:45.533 --> 42:47.832
Narrator:
Well, if it's worth doing,

42:47.833 --> 42:51.966
it's worth over-doing.

42:51.967 --> 42:53.399
So, we got to call it.

42:53.400 --> 42:56.366
Driving on two wheels
is easy according to the movies.

42:56.367 --> 42:57.432
Where do we stand?

42:57.433 --> 42:58.433
Not.
Nah.

42:58.434 --> 43:00.099
This one is totally busted.

43:00.100 --> 43:01.232
It's hard.

43:01.233 --> 43:03.699
It's also fun, but you know,
it's dangerous.

43:03.700 --> 43:06.699
And to get to where you're
any good and reliable at it,

43:06.700 --> 43:08.866
it's one whole
heck of a lot of work.

43:08.867 --> 43:11.200
Yeah. Only in the hands
of experts.

43:13.067 --> 43:14.232
[ Laughs ]

43:14.233 --> 43:16.732
Well, looks like we're walking.

43:16.733 --> 43:17.767
I guess so.

43:20.733 --> 43:21.932
He's amazing.

43:21.933 --> 43:23.933
Straight as an arrow.
