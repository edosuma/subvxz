00:01.049 --> 00:03.139
<I>Ten minutes.
Ten minutes to air.</I>

00:03.264 --> 00:05.349
Cast should be changing.

00:12.054 --> 00:13.470
You wanted to see me?

00:14.465 --> 00:16.748
Does it seem weird in here to you?

00:18.000 --> 00:24.074

00:29.602 --> 00:31.812
Everything look like
a mexican soap opera.

00:32.692 --> 00:33.950
I don't know.
Does it?

00:35.060 --> 00:37.952
God, I can see every line
and pore on your face!

00:39.181 --> 00:41.357
It looks like a YMCA climbing wall.

00:42.396 --> 00:44.112
My face cream was recalled.

00:44.237 --> 00:46.885
Apparently
it was destroying the lab rats...

00:47.348 --> 00:49.198
What is that word?
Brains.

00:50.482 --> 00:52.953
I just wanted to let you know
that while Avery is pregnant,

00:53.078 --> 00:54.622
I am giving up drinking.

00:54.747 --> 00:56.796
She can't drink, I won't drink.

00:57.717 --> 01:00.149
I don't know
if that's a good idea for you.

01:00.713 --> 01:03.913
Remember what happened that time
I tried to give up refined sugars?

01:05.360 --> 01:06.760
Looking good, Liz.

01:12.302 --> 01:14.757
Our bodies, we don't want
all that processed junk.

01:14.925 --> 01:16.928
I don't know
if you've read Michael Pollan...

01:17.053 --> 01:18.402
Who wants donuts?

01:19.189 --> 01:20.375
I'll kill you!

01:25.523 --> 01:27.835
Why are you better-looking
in your memory?

01:28.505 --> 01:30.282
My memory has <i>Seinfeld</i> money.

01:31.808 --> 01:33.018
Don't worry for me.

01:33.143 --> 01:36.328
It has always been about the ritual.
I just have to replace the ritual.

01:36.453 --> 01:39.015
And Avery got me this nice tea set,

01:40.075 --> 01:41.583
some knitting needles and yarn

01:41.708 --> 01:44.244
and a book on sleight-of-hand magic.

01:51.428 --> 01:52.880
That's as far as I've gotten.

01:54.898 --> 01:58.134
Well, if that's it,
I'm going to go downstairs.

01:58.302 --> 01:59.820
Have a good show.

02:00.110 --> 02:01.837
I'm dreading watching it sober.

02:06.663 --> 02:08.344
Jack knows it's my birthday, right?

02:09.485 --> 02:10.535
Let me see.

02:11.050 --> 02:13.917
I have my master list
of staff birthdays right here.

02:15.524 --> 02:17.620
I seem to have forgotten
to put you on it.

02:18.061 --> 02:20.836
Is this because
of that joke I made the other day?

02:22.174 --> 02:23.874
Jonathan, give me a pen?

02:24.266 --> 02:26.260
Yeah, chal boy, get in here.

02:28.204 --> 02:30.363
You'll never be a millionaire.

02:36.360 --> 02:38.279
<i>Slumdog millionaire</i> ref.

02:38.582 --> 02:39.582
Slammo.

02:41.710 --> 02:43.312
Don't know
what you're talking about.

02:43.480 --> 02:46.336
Whatever, Jack will remember
because we're friends.

02:46.461 --> 02:48.684
Also, it's a pretty big birthday.

02:50.096 --> 02:51.587
Are you turning 1,000?

02:52.587 --> 02:55.661
Really, you want to play this game
with a comedy writer?

03:04.299 --> 03:06.798
<i>Live show
It's the </i> 30 Rock <i> live show</i>

03:06.923 --> 03:08.473
<i>It's </i> 30 Rock <i> live</i>

03:11.321 --> 03:13.881
<i>Why, though
Do a </i> 30 Rock <i> live show?</i>

03:14.006 --> 03:15.556
<i>Why </i> 30 Rock <i> live?</i>

03:16.381 --> 03:19.504
<i>Because this is my gift
to you our audience!</i>

03:28.216 --> 03:29.316
Hi, Jadwiga.

03:29.625 --> 03:30.625
Hello.

03:32.080 --> 03:33.729
I haven't seen you in a while.

03:33.897 --> 03:36.149
Yes, bullet in brain move.

03:37.258 --> 03:38.458
Much hospital.

03:40.085 --> 03:41.552
I'm glad to see you back.

03:41.677 --> 03:43.928
I wanted to let you know
there's probably gonna be

03:44.053 --> 03:46.575
some kind of a party later
because it's my birthday.

03:48.438 --> 03:51.697
<i>Happy days</i> is my favorite show.

03:53.256 --> 03:56.752
Yes <i>Happy days</i> it's a great show,
but there might be a mess,

03:58.664 --> 04:00.256
Are we understanding each other?

04:01.152 --> 04:02.424
I clean you now?

04:03.497 --> 04:04.881
You don't have to clean me.

04:05.006 --> 04:07.338
You may have to clean up
after a surprise party later

04:07.463 --> 04:09.951
cause it's my birthday,
and it's a big one.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.471
What are we doing, Jadwiga?

04:15.639 --> 04:16.719
I like Fonzi.

04:19.726 --> 04:22.573
His office is bathroom,
just like Jadwiga.

04:24.728 --> 04:26.178
Good talk, Jadwiga.

04:32.907 --> 04:34.323
Got your messages.

04:34.491 --> 04:36.902
A Mr. Brett favre stopped by,

04:37.027 --> 04:39.528
and dropped off
this picture of a hot dog.

04:40.922 --> 04:41.922
Finally.

04:42.698 --> 04:44.579
And the chilean miners are all out,

04:44.704 --> 04:47.102
and they're angry
about what you said about them.

04:47.951 --> 04:50.706
I guess they're geniuses
for getting stuck in a mine.

04:51.728 --> 04:53.262
Also your pharmacy called,

04:53.387 --> 04:55.945
apparently you can't
get a prescription for ecstacy.

04:57.695 --> 04:59.145
Thanks, Obama care.

05:00.560 --> 05:03.610
If you need somebody to scream at,
I'm right here.

05:07.005 --> 05:08.355
Hello, Ms. Lemon.

05:10.441 --> 05:11.841
What's up, giggly?

05:12.393 --> 05:13.543
I don't know.

05:14.948 --> 05:18.618
Mr. Hornberger needs to see you
in Mr. Jordan's dressing room.

05:19.541 --> 05:20.630
I wonder why.

05:20.755 --> 05:23.005
I don't know.
You better find out.

05:27.943 --> 05:29.184
Surprise, Liz.

05:29.309 --> 05:32.047
Tracy has come up
with a new way to ruin the show.

05:32.215 --> 05:36.018
What? No, I told you,
your lizard can't be the musical guest.

05:36.196 --> 05:39.388
Of course, not.
His album doesn't drop until December.

05:41.825 --> 05:43.198
For the first time ever

05:43.323 --> 05:46.595
Tracy watched the non-porn version
of the <i>Carol Burnett Show</i>.

05:46.763 --> 05:47.763
Sure.

05:48.019 --> 05:49.958
It was funnier
than the porn version,

05:50.083 --> 05:52.470
and the best part is when the actors
started cracking up.

05:52.595 --> 05:55.404
They laughed so hard
they couldn't even finish the skit.

05:55.572 --> 05:56.905
Your point is?

05:57.439 --> 05:59.174
I would like to do that, please.

06:00.314 --> 06:01.176
Do what?

06:01.344 --> 06:03.946
Crack up instead of saying
these stupid lines I wrote.

06:04.114 --> 06:07.383
Stupid lines I wrote,
and, no, we're not doing that.

06:07.828 --> 06:10.552
You never take
my creative suggestions.

06:10.720 --> 06:12.556
The only one I remember
is you wanted

06:12.681 --> 06:15.124
to hire those two strippers
to dance behind you.

06:15.292 --> 06:17.830
You should have.
Those dudes were awesome.

06:19.041 --> 06:21.030
And so is my crack-up idea.

06:22.020 --> 06:24.600
What are you talking about
is called breaking,

06:25.339 --> 06:28.889
you know, sure, audiences
love it when something goes wrong.

06:29.816 --> 06:31.940
We don't do that here.
It's cheap.

06:32.730 --> 06:34.877
So no breaking.
Promise?

06:35.270 --> 06:36.270
I promise.

06:36.395 --> 06:37.946
I swear on my mother's grape.

06:39.658 --> 06:42.412
- Did you say grave or grape?
- Yes, good-bye.

06:46.809 --> 06:50.502
Gentlemen, tonight I'm gonna laugh
harder than I did at Dotcom's play.

06:51.102 --> 06:53.462
It was <i>Angels in America</i>, Trey!

07:00.823 --> 07:02.210
Mr. Donaghy called.

07:02.739 --> 07:04.707
Why are you giggling?
It's very misleading.

07:04.875 --> 07:07.202
I don't know.
I'm sorry, it's just...

07:07.327 --> 07:10.403
Mr. Lutz is wearing
the most hilarious t-shirt,

07:10.528 --> 07:13.148
and every time I see it,
just take a look!

07:13.316 --> 07:14.962
JE SUIS AVEC L'IDIOT.

07:16.082 --> 07:18.650
Whoever standing next to him,
it's stupid!

07:19.317 --> 07:20.893
That guy is stupid.

07:21.240 --> 07:23.158
Now, she's stupid.

07:23.326 --> 07:24.510
Now they are.

07:24.635 --> 07:25.929
Now I were.

07:28.636 --> 07:29.800
Anyway...

07:29.925 --> 07:32.195
Mr. Donaghy called
while you were in with Mr. Jordan.

07:32.320 --> 07:34.370
He needs to see you right away.

07:35.846 --> 07:37.840
I almost forgot.
Happy birthday.

07:38.755 --> 07:39.755
The song.

07:40.110 --> 07:42.033
Legal says
we can't use it in the sketch,

07:42.158 --> 07:43.358
but we can use

07:43.740 --> 07:46.240
<i>It's your B-day, Bitch</i>
by Snooki's mom.

07:48.812 --> 07:51.082
Wait,
did I just hear that correctly?

07:51.207 --> 07:54.463
Because last year, I wrote a song
called <i>It's your Birthday, Slut</i>.

07:54.588 --> 07:56.892
Does her track
sound anything like this?

07:57.425 --> 08:00.229
<i>You say that it's your birthday
Time to skank it up hard</i>

08:01.366 --> 08:03.418
<i>Choke a cup with your panties</i>

08:17.132 --> 08:18.914
did you just nip that?

08:20.004 --> 08:21.383
I need a drink!

08:22.330 --> 08:23.193
Already?

08:23.318 --> 08:26.164
- We can get through this.
- It turns out it's not the ritual.

08:26.289 --> 08:28.889
According to a bunch
of on-line questionnaires,

08:29.014 --> 08:30.762
I have a drinking problem.

08:30.887 --> 08:33.037
God, I have a splitting headache!

08:33.871 --> 08:36.982
Replace the ritual.
Could you come over here, please?

08:48.004 --> 08:49.344
Finish the magic book?

08:49.512 --> 08:51.278
I cannot divulge my secrets.

08:52.005 --> 08:54.891
I don't wanna let Avery down,
but this is so hard.

08:55.532 --> 08:56.754
Distract me, Lemon.

08:56.879 --> 08:58.029
Entertain me.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.820
Open on
the Covent Garden flower market!

09:01.945 --> 09:03.664
The year?
1892!

09:04.443 --> 09:06.668
Flowers!
Flowers for sale!

09:06.793 --> 09:08.178
Get out of here!

09:13.819 --> 09:15.504
Did he remember your birthday?

09:15.629 --> 09:16.729
Oh, come on!

09:23.048 --> 09:25.948
What's up, New York?
Tracy Jordan in the house!

09:30.816 --> 09:32.416
You're the real stars!

09:32.941 --> 09:33.991
Not really!

09:36.265 --> 09:39.315
Fox News.
A division of Fox nonsense incorporated.

09:40.483 --> 09:42.316
Welcome back to Fox News.

09:42.443 --> 09:43.493
I'm blonde.

09:46.254 --> 09:48.920
President Obama, in your own words,

09:49.045 --> 09:51.540
why are you a terrorist
who hates America?

09:52.627 --> 09:54.577
That's an excellent question.

09:56.631 --> 09:58.866
I'm doing something
called "breaking"!

10:01.061 --> 10:02.004
Snort!

10:02.129 --> 10:03.255
Giggle-giggle!

10:03.380 --> 10:04.987
The audience loves this.

10:09.218 --> 10:10.468
Oh, that idiot.

10:11.098 --> 10:13.601
- Fine, just go to commercial.
- Go to commercial.

10:15.545 --> 10:17.178
Erectile dysfunction.

10:17.967 --> 10:20.301
It's not just a dog problem anymore.

10:20.918 --> 10:23.291
It also affects millions of men.

10:23.591 --> 10:26.158
Hello.
I'm "doctor" Leo Spaceman.

10:26.959 --> 10:30.950
For too long, e.d.
Has been viewed as a physical problem.

10:31.262 --> 10:32.877
And it's been treated with pills

10:33.002 --> 10:34.629
and ointments and contraptions

10:34.754 --> 10:37.131
whose straps break all too easily.

10:37.821 --> 10:39.691
But couldn't the real cause of e.d.

10:39.816 --> 10:42.460
be that we haven't produced
a good doing-it song

10:42.585 --> 10:45.041
since <i>Close the Door</i>
by Teddy Pendergrass?

10:45.673 --> 10:47.663
That's why I recorded an album.

10:49.693 --> 10:52.159
<i>Baby, let's take it slow</i>

10:52.730 --> 10:54.728
<i>You know we got all night</i>

10:55.251 --> 10:57.673
<i>Light some candles, draw a bath</i>

10:57.877 --> 11:00.602
<i>And start off
with full-on intercourse!</i>

11:02.221 --> 11:04.836
Guaranteed
to end erectile dysfunction,

11:04.961 --> 11:08.531
these are the sweet sounds
of Dr. Leo Spaceman's <i>Love Storm</i>.

11:08.992 --> 11:11.320
An ultra-strength audio rebonulator.

11:12.817 --> 11:13.617
<i>Baby</i>

11:13.742 --> 11:15.680
<i>Let's let the dog watch us</i>

11:16.017 --> 11:17.915
<i>Do you think he understands</i>

11:18.040 --> 11:19.765
<i>The love that we have?</i>

11:20.289 --> 11:21.941
<i>Oops, I'm finished</i>

11:22.252 --> 11:23.802
<i>Call yourself a cab</i>

11:31.498 --> 11:32.548
Hey, idiot!

11:34.349 --> 11:36.757
I know we're not usually
the most grateful bunch,

11:36.882 --> 11:39.715
but everybody here,
and I mean, everybody,

11:39.883 --> 11:42.684
is signing this birthday card
for Jadwiga, the cleaning lady.

11:42.852 --> 11:44.853
Really.
Jadwiga's birthday.

11:45.021 --> 11:47.389
I lookout for her,
we're friends with benefits.

11:49.872 --> 11:51.811
You should be ashamed of yourself.

11:51.995 --> 11:54.229
I can't be.
I'm missing that part of my brain.

11:55.100 --> 11:56.365
Why are you doing this?

11:56.533 --> 11:58.062
Why does anybody do anything?

11:58.187 --> 12:00.598
They're rich or have attention
deficit disorder.

12:00.723 --> 12:02.223
Look at Lutz's shirt.

12:05.313 --> 12:07.976
You are ruining the show.
No more laughing.

12:08.144 --> 12:10.561
All right. No more laughing.
I promise.

12:10.686 --> 12:11.886
Krout's honor.

12:13.423 --> 12:15.156
Did you say scout or krout?

12:19.807 --> 12:22.457
Carol, I knew you wouldn't
forget me today.

12:22.625 --> 12:26.100
No nonessential chatter, Liz.
I'm having the worst flight of my life.

12:27.810 --> 12:30.709
We good wind shears, lightning,
severe turbulence.

12:30.834 --> 12:32.434
The in-flight meal was a frittata.

12:33.682 --> 12:34.936
Oh, my God. At night?

12:35.213 --> 12:38.475
Lizzie, if something were to happen,
I want you to know that...

12:39.295 --> 12:43.079
I need you to go to my apartment
and just clear out all the porn

12:43.204 --> 12:44.579
before my mom gets there.

12:45.516 --> 12:46.548
That's it?

12:47.209 --> 12:50.118
I also need you to TiVO <i>Bones</i> for me
in case I survive.

12:50.856 --> 12:53.019
You know what, Carol,
today is a very special day,

12:53.144 --> 12:56.358
and you should have known that,
and you can't use cell phones on planes.

12:56.998 --> 12:59.548
No, that's just something
we tell passengers.

13:00.789 --> 13:01.789
Hold on.

13:05.311 --> 13:08.070
I think I just screwed up
something with my girlfriend.

13:09.516 --> 13:10.976
I have always loved you.

13:12.407 --> 13:14.457
- Not now, Kevin.
- Copy that.

13:21.910 --> 13:24.152
How could you let Tracy
do that to me?

13:24.320 --> 13:27.033
- Don't worry, it's under control.
- I am a professional.

13:27.158 --> 13:30.058
I have never broken
during a performance, ever.

13:31.027 --> 13:34.006
I was on stage in <i>Pippin</i>
with Irene Ryan when she died,

13:34.131 --> 13:35.404
and I kept on going.

13:35.941 --> 13:38.147
That is why you are so amazing.

13:38.272 --> 13:39.623
I will never break.

13:39.748 --> 13:43.478
But if he pulls that stunt again,
I will have a wardrobe malfunction.

13:43.864 --> 13:45.852
Yes, I will slip a nip, Liz.

13:46.064 --> 13:48.247
So help me, I will slip a nip.

13:51.355 --> 13:52.814
Hi, Jadwiga. How are you?

13:53.370 --> 13:54.527
Sit on it.

14:01.207 --> 14:03.992
- Are you sniffing paint?
- Of course I am!

14:04.595 --> 14:05.807
Men need alcohol.

14:05.932 --> 14:08.982
It's the first thing every civilization
makes along with weapons

14:09.416 --> 14:11.474
and shelters to enjoy prostitutes.

14:12.137 --> 14:14.002
I don't know how much more of this
I can take.

14:14.170 --> 14:15.537
The worst day of my life.

14:15.844 --> 14:17.956
Your life?
Of your life?

14:18.552 --> 14:20.379
How are we going to make this
about you?

14:20.843 --> 14:23.912
It's my birthday! It's my 40th birthday,
and no one remembered!

14:24.080 --> 14:25.313
Damn you, she-beasts!

14:27.070 --> 14:28.070
What?

14:28.532 --> 14:31.805
You and Avery.
You lay these traps to make me fail!

14:33.835 --> 14:36.744
I'm sorry I forgot your birthday.

14:36.869 --> 14:38.993
It's not my best day.
I'm not myself right now.

14:39.118 --> 14:42.297
Please accept this $1,000
as my gift to you.

14:43.607 --> 14:46.568
I will take this on principle,
but it doesn't fix anything.

14:47.284 --> 14:50.762
This is what happens to people like us
who put work ahead of everything else.

14:50.887 --> 14:53.580
You know where I spent my 40th birthday?
In my office.

14:53.808 --> 14:54.808
All night.

15:01.850 --> 15:03.518
You were really fit back then.

15:05.055 --> 15:06.958
Yes, but my penis was smaller.

15:12.501 --> 15:15.807
I'm not trying to make you feel guilty.
I mean, I know who I am.

15:15.932 --> 15:18.183
I know I'm not
the funnest person in the group.

15:18.308 --> 15:21.306
I'm not the one you call
when you want to go clubbing on the town

15:21.431 --> 15:23.016
and party dancing all night.

15:23.373 --> 15:25.240
Why are you speaking
like a Persian immigrant?

15:27.458 --> 15:30.322
But I thought I at least
these dummies would do something for me

15:30.447 --> 15:32.893
besides light a bunch of fires
I have to put out.

15:33.018 --> 15:35.250
I thought when I turned 40...

15:35.418 --> 15:36.418
40.

15:36.612 --> 15:38.520
I could really drink a forty
right now.

15:42.858 --> 15:46.408
Oprah, this is what the inside
of a child's face looks like.

15:48.430 --> 15:50.705
My Oprah wig is falling off!

15:51.523 --> 15:53.118
This is an exciting mishap!

15:53.243 --> 15:54.393
This is live!

15:56.205 --> 15:57.760
What the blurg?

16:01.989 --> 16:03.511
Have you been drinking?

16:04.557 --> 16:06.687
I mean, I had a bottle of wine
with dinner.

16:07.838 --> 16:09.017
Can I smell your mouth?

16:10.004 --> 16:11.661
I thought you'd never ask.

16:15.946 --> 16:18.565
I needed that. I have been giving up
drinking while Avery is pregnant,

16:18.690 --> 16:20.537
- and it's really hard.
- Of course.

16:20.662 --> 16:23.298
But being with someone
means making sacrifices.

16:26.211 --> 16:29.922
I've learned by being with Paul.
It's made me more mature.

16:32.375 --> 16:33.618
It is nipple time!

16:35.862 --> 16:37.869
Now my mustache is askew!

16:38.638 --> 16:40.016
That thing fell off!

16:40.141 --> 16:41.641
And that thing, too!

16:44.153 --> 16:46.632
My shirt
is accidentally falling off!

16:48.122 --> 16:49.290
America!

16:54.070 --> 16:57.602
I warned you, Liz!
And now I'm slipping a nip!

16:57.727 --> 17:00.335
- The big one!
- Go to commercial!

17:03.210 --> 17:05.118
Hi, I'm Dr. Drew Baird.

17:08.020 --> 17:11.588
Every year, dozens of people
lose a hand to a helicopter

17:11.713 --> 17:14.867
or fireworks mishap.
Or, in my case, both.

17:15.425 --> 17:16.957
But now there's hope.

17:17.300 --> 17:20.355
Thanks to an idea that started
as a pitch for a horror movie and grew

17:20.522 --> 17:22.180
into a charitable organization,

17:22.590 --> 17:25.294
hands from executed criminals
are now making life better

17:25.419 --> 17:27.522
for people all over the world.

17:27.647 --> 17:29.210
People like me.

17:31.061 --> 17:33.876
But we can't do it without your support.
So give...

17:34.218 --> 17:35.926
and give someone a hand.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.375
Sorry.
I'm trying to do a thumbs-up here.

17:40.543 --> 17:41.773
It doesn't always listen.

17:41.898 --> 17:43.801
God, no.
That's a black power thing.

17:46.817 --> 17:48.373
Why are you doing this?

17:48.498 --> 17:49.576
Bad hand!

17:51.868 --> 17:53.609
God, it's got my testicles!

17:57.930 --> 18:00.128
Listen up.
We forgot Liz lemon's birthday.

18:00.296 --> 18:02.197
Her 40th birthday.

18:03.533 --> 18:05.790
How?
You gave me your list!

18:06.967 --> 18:09.404
Never mind how it happened.
That's water under the bridge.

18:09.572 --> 18:11.562
I'm sorry,
we don't have that expression in Canada.

18:11.687 --> 18:14.442
Does it mean that what happened
can be used to power a lumbermill?

18:17.218 --> 18:20.429
It means that we're going to do
something nice for our friend Liz lemon,

18:20.554 --> 18:23.056
'cause she takes care of us.
We're going to take care of her,

18:23.181 --> 18:26.159
even if we are currently sober
for the first time in ten years.

18:26.513 --> 18:27.288
Not me.

18:27.456 --> 18:29.551
I just got my ten-year drunk chip.

18:30.535 --> 18:31.540
Thank you.

18:31.759 --> 18:34.548
Pete, what can you pull together?
Istime to do something for Liz on air?

18:34.673 --> 18:38.483
Not really. I mean, I could cut
the product placement for capital one.

18:39.435 --> 18:41.913
You can't do that.
The capital one venture card is amazing.

18:42.038 --> 18:45.038
They give double miles every day
for every purchase!

18:51.462 --> 18:53.581
Or the cast could say something
during goodnights.

18:53.749 --> 18:56.748
No, it has to be big enough that Liz
will believe we planned it all along.

18:57.520 --> 18:59.040
I've got an idea!

18:59.984 --> 19:01.313
What if...

19:02.330 --> 19:03.330
we...

19:03.926 --> 19:05.378
Spit it out!

19:06.896 --> 19:09.475
Please set yourself for goodnight.

19:13.315 --> 19:14.436
Did you crash?

19:14.604 --> 19:16.342
No, but it was pretty scary.

19:16.467 --> 19:19.305
I mean, not like the stuff I saw
in the air force, of course.

19:19.430 --> 19:21.800
Like this one time a bunch
of us pilots got together

19:21.925 --> 19:24.446
and went to a haunted house in Germany.
It was messed up.

19:26.104 --> 19:27.909
Today is my birthday, Carol.

19:28.442 --> 19:30.226
It's your birthday.
Dammit.

19:30.351 --> 19:33.718
I'm sorry.
Happy birthday, Lizzie.

19:34.223 --> 19:37.105
Don't worry. I've known these dummies
a lot longer, and none of them...

19:37.653 --> 19:38.723
Oh, my god.

19:42.884 --> 19:44.299
You did remember.

19:44.467 --> 19:46.895
What's happening there?
Is that a surprise party?

19:47.020 --> 19:50.472
Surprise! I was totally in on it.
It was really expensive.

19:54.673 --> 19:56.177
Happy birthday, Lemon.

19:56.345 --> 19:58.543
You, you knew all along?

19:58.867 --> 20:02.251
Come on, you didn't think
we'd forget your birthday, did you?

20:02.652 --> 20:04.319
- 30 seconds!
- Is that a polka band?

20:04.487 --> 20:05.681
Happy birthday!

20:06.524 --> 20:07.651
Wait a minute.

20:07.932 --> 20:09.858
Wait.
Why is Henry Winkler

20:10.224 --> 20:11.370
on my cake?

20:13.143 --> 20:14.440
I like Fonzi.

20:16.666 --> 20:18.900
This is supposed to be for Jadwiga.

20:19.068 --> 20:22.203
- No, everybody loves the Fonz!
- 10 seconds!

20:22.561 --> 20:24.886
You stole
an old cleaning lady's birthday

20:25.011 --> 20:26.407
just to make me happy?

20:26.924 --> 20:28.049
In my defense,

20:28.384 --> 20:29.244
yes.

20:31.087 --> 20:33.443
That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me!

20:34.189 --> 20:36.217
Five seconds.
Five, four,

20:36.704 --> 20:37.704
three...

20:44.560 --> 20:47.507
On behalf of everyone at "TGS",
we want to...

20:47.632 --> 20:48.863
Good night!

20:58.606 --> 21:01.179
Well, I know your birthday
isn't what you hoped, lemon,

21:01.304 --> 21:03.678
- but at least it was memorable.
- You know what?

21:04.005 --> 21:05.172
It was perfect.

21:05.297 --> 21:08.883
It was the best of both worlds.
It was... Yeah, sorry.

21:12.530 --> 21:14.000
It's the best of both worlded.

21:14.125 --> 21:16.238
I got to feel martyred
and indigo napt all day,

21:16.363 --> 21:18.193
and I still got to eat cake
off the floor.

21:19.423 --> 21:21.763
But, I still have one birthday wish.

21:22.439 --> 21:24.104
I want to you have a drink with me.

21:24.539 --> 21:26.518
I know Avery doesn't want me to,

21:26.643 --> 21:29.836
but it's dangerous to say no
to an old spinster.

21:31.501 --> 21:33.107
You might turn me into a crow.

21:34.443 --> 21:35.510
To you, liz lemon.

21:35.678 --> 21:37.285
You're halfway to death.

21:41.707 --> 21:43.112
That's more like it.
