00:00.200 --> 00:03.769
<i>- Previously
on "The Magicians"...</i>

00:05.339 --> 00:08.073
- No, no, no.
- Don't you fucking touch her.

00:08.074 --> 00:09.575
Fine, I'll take you first.

00:09.577 --> 00:11.477
No!
No.

00:14.148 --> 00:15.781
- Now!

00:15.783 --> 00:17.116
- Julia.
- Move!

00:17.118 --> 00:19.385
Wait.

00:19.387 --> 00:21.587
- I had Reynard.
I had the beast.

00:21.589 --> 00:23.589
- Man, fuck this.
We're out.

00:26.326 --> 00:28.227
The chain was the only thing
keeping my hand from...

00:28.229 --> 00:31.397
- sorry.
Not my problem.

00:31.399 --> 00:33.065
- Do you know what a niffin is?

00:33.067 --> 00:34.266
It's when too much
runs through you,

00:34.268 --> 00:35.367
<i>consumes you.</i>

00:35.369 --> 00:37.269
<i>Only the magic is left.</i>

00:37.271 --> 00:42.141
- Hard to cast
when you're sliced in two.

00:44.445 --> 00:46.078
What is she doing?

00:46.080 --> 00:48.147
She can't.
She'll niffin out.

00:48.149 --> 00:49.481
Alice, stop.

00:52.053 --> 00:56.121
- Let's finally finish this.

00:56.123 --> 00:58.123
- He did it on purpose.

01:02.462 --> 01:06.398
- Alice, don't.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.074

01:43.670 --> 01:47.172
- Five surgeries.
- He'll recover.

01:47.174 --> 01:49.408
- I know we're being serious
right now,

01:49.410 --> 01:52.411
but that surgeon
has the biggest dick.

01:57.584 --> 02:00.586
Eliot, it's time to go.

02:02.322 --> 02:04.323
- Our kingdom awaits.

02:12.600 --> 02:15.667
- With the beast dead, there's
a power vacuum in Fillory.

02:15.669 --> 02:17.336
- Power vacuum?

02:17.338 --> 02:19.905
Hello?
High king and queen right here.

02:19.907 --> 02:23.208
- We, of course, recognize your
rule, but others...

02:23.210 --> 02:24.710
- everyone assumes
you'll be dead soon...

02:24.712 --> 02:28.680
Or you'll run away
or vanish or go mad.

02:28.682 --> 02:30.349
- There are stirrings
of rebellion

02:30.351 --> 02:32.284
in the Southern orchard,
the outer islands,

02:32.286 --> 02:34.219
refusal to pay
the crown's taxes.

02:34.221 --> 02:36.421
- You know who loves
paying taxes?

02:36.423 --> 02:38.357
People with broken legs.

02:40.227 --> 02:41.527
- Abigail would remind you

02:41.529 --> 02:43.629
that money cannot fill
the wellspring.

02:43.631 --> 02:45.364
Without it, Fillory withers.

02:45.366 --> 02:47.399
- Okay, well,
we talked about this.

02:47.401 --> 02:49.401
When someone drops a log
at a public pool,

02:49.403 --> 02:51.537
you just send a kid with a net
to fish it out.

02:51.539 --> 02:55.507
- The befouling
was substantial, your majesty.

02:55.509 --> 02:57.509
We've employed
several filtration systems,

02:57.511 --> 03:00.245
but the wellspring
isn't recovering fast enough.

03:00.247 --> 03:02.481
- If there was a royal appeal
to ember himself...

03:02.483 --> 03:04.383
- okay, we can't find him.

03:04.385 --> 03:07.252
He's not in his temple
or his filthy sex cave.

03:07.254 --> 03:08.620
- We need to devote
more resources.

03:08.622 --> 03:09.955
- We're going to build
a monument

03:09.957 --> 03:11.523
to our fallen queen...

03:11.525 --> 03:14.226
A statue, I think...

03:14.228 --> 03:15.527
100 feet high.

03:15.529 --> 03:16.962
- Do you know
what that would cost?

03:16.964 --> 03:18.964
- I don't care
how much it costs.

03:18.966 --> 03:21.667
I want designs drawn up
and funds...

03:21.669 --> 03:24.970
Funded immediately.

03:24.972 --> 03:28.540
- Can you give us a moment?

03:28.542 --> 03:31.543
I said get the fuck out.

03:37.817 --> 03:39.585
So that's the plan, huh...

03:39.587 --> 03:41.820
Blow all our cash
on sappy nonsense,

03:41.822 --> 03:43.288
bankrupt the kingdom?

03:43.290 --> 03:44.723
- We have to do something.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.225
Alice was our friend.

03:46.227 --> 03:48.627
- No. She wasn't.

03:48.629 --> 03:51.730
Alice was a package deal.
She came with Quentin.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.765
- Somebody skipped her colonic
this morning.

03:53.767 --> 03:56.668
- For whatever stupid reason,

03:56.670 --> 04:00.305
you're the high king
of an entire land.

04:00.307 --> 04:01.840
You have to be
responsible, Eliot.

04:01.842 --> 04:03.709
- Since when are you
Fillory Clinton?

04:03.711 --> 04:05.811
- Since I'm me.

04:05.813 --> 04:09.715
My crown is just as heavy
as yours.

04:09.717 --> 04:12.451
- You can leave
whenever you feel like it.

04:12.453 --> 04:14.019
You can go back to Brakebills.

04:14.021 --> 04:17.255
You can do whatever
you goddamn want.

04:20.392 --> 04:22.294
I don't belong here.

04:22.296 --> 04:23.762
I'm not ready to be a king.

04:23.764 --> 04:27.599
I wasn't done being me.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.701
It was so much simpler
when there was just

04:29.703 --> 04:33.472
one giant evil dick
trying to kill us.

04:33.474 --> 04:36.375
Now we're just...
- grown-ups.

04:36.377 --> 04:40.479
- How did this happen?

04:40.481 --> 04:42.714
- I have an idea...
To help you.

04:42.716 --> 04:45.651
- Like a loophole?
- Mm-hmm.

04:50.823 --> 04:53.792
- You're gonna ironically
abandon me here to go find it.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.827
- I'll be back.
I promise.

04:58.464 --> 05:00.499
- I know you...

05:00.501 --> 05:02.367
Will.

05:32.666 --> 05:35.534
Hey.

05:35.536 --> 05:38.670
- Kady?

05:38.672 --> 05:39.838
Hey.

05:41.542 --> 05:44.409
- Kady, come on,
I need your help.

05:46.747 --> 05:48.747
Let's go.

06:12.139 --> 06:14.740
- You haven't had any other
problems with your casting?

06:14.742 --> 06:16.875
- I've had nothing but problems.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.610
I thought it was because
of my hands,

06:18.612 --> 06:21.613
but it's getting worse,
not better.

06:21.615 --> 06:24.449
- Hmm.

06:24.451 --> 06:28.687
I've had a few...
Brownouts, you could call them.

06:28.689 --> 06:30.956
I mean, I thought it was
the Xanax, honestly.

06:30.958 --> 06:32.624
- How many?

06:32.626 --> 06:35.560
- Two a day if I can get them.

06:35.562 --> 06:36.895
Oh, you mean the brownouts.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.164
Four or five.

06:39.166 --> 06:40.499
Hmm.

06:43.803 --> 06:45.804
- Yes.

06:54.415 --> 06:56.515
- What happened?

06:56.517 --> 06:58.450
- I'm trying to get back here,
but my aim's off.

06:58.452 --> 07:00.719
- Okay, all right, it seems like
more than your aim.

07:00.721 --> 07:01.887
- Last three worlds I've been in

07:01.889 --> 07:03.755
haven't had any fucking oxygen.

07:03.757 --> 07:06.625
My fingers just... they just...
They just keep shorting me out.

07:09.029 --> 07:11.897
What happened?
Did we kill the beast?

07:11.899 --> 07:13.899
- We did.

07:15.469 --> 07:20.038
- But, um, Quentin's
pretty banged up.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.841
Alice was hurt
a lot worse, penny.

07:25.511 --> 07:28.046
She... she died.

07:37.056 --> 07:40.659
- Budget?
- Citizen petitions.

07:40.661 --> 07:43.962
I want everyone
to stop wanting things.

07:43.964 --> 07:47.833
Great time to ask for something?

07:47.835 --> 07:49.935
- Your father makes knives
for a living

07:49.937 --> 07:51.703
and knows where I sleep, so...

07:51.705 --> 07:53.905
Ask away.

07:55.908 --> 07:59.244
- I'm know I'm not precisely
the type

07:59.246 --> 08:01.480
you'd most likely choose,

08:01.482 --> 08:05.684
and I wasn't so experienced
when we were first together,

08:05.686 --> 08:06.985
but you're so great at it.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.955
You're... you're huge,
and it's so good.

08:09.957 --> 08:13.792
And, Eliot, I don't know how
to politely ask you to fuck me.

08:15.828 --> 08:17.929
- Oh, look, Margo’s here.

08:17.931 --> 08:19.764
- You remember Lasaro?

08:19.766 --> 08:21.066
- That creep who made
the margolem?

08:21.068 --> 08:23.568
- I twisted his arms
and/or balls a little,

08:23.570 --> 08:25.604
and he gave up the spell.

08:25.606 --> 08:26.872
Living Clay is hard to come by,

08:26.874 --> 08:29.608
but Fogg left his stash
so unprotected,

08:29.610 --> 08:31.843
it's like
he wanted me to steal it.

08:31.845 --> 08:34.578
So I did.

08:34.581 --> 08:36.715
We're gonna make another you.

08:42.989 --> 08:44.623
- Hey.

08:44.625 --> 08:47.592
- Made you a sandwich...
Half an hour ago.

08:47.594 --> 08:49.594
Then I ate it.

08:49.596 --> 08:51.096
- I'm sorry.

08:51.098 --> 08:53.899
It's been a long time
since I've had a hot shower.

08:53.901 --> 08:55.033
- How you feeling?

08:55.035 --> 08:57.068
- Uh...

08:57.070 --> 08:58.904
Better...

08:58.906 --> 09:01.740
Nap, seeing you alive,

09:01.742 --> 09:04.609
magic methadone...

09:04.611 --> 09:07.812
Methadone.

09:07.814 --> 09:09.648
Thanks...

09:09.650 --> 09:12.150
For all of it.

09:12.152 --> 09:16.321
So, um, how did you find me?

09:16.323 --> 09:18.757
- After asking around a bit,
I heard about a girl

09:18.759 --> 09:20.892
who was doing miracles
for a quick fix.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.061
- I called it
"turning tricks."

09:23.063 --> 09:24.963
- You think I'm judging you,
I'm not.

09:24.965 --> 09:28.767
- No.
No, I'm judging myself.

09:28.769 --> 09:32.137
You... you saved my life,

09:32.139 --> 09:34.806
and...

09:34.808 --> 09:38.777
You know, i-i thought
it would be okay to run...

09:38.779 --> 09:41.012
If I got the cavalry
and I came back to help you,

09:41.014 --> 09:42.914
but I...

09:42.916 --> 09:46.685
I just ran.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.753
I hid.

09:48.755 --> 09:52.824
- Yeah, well, there was nothing
you could have done then.

09:52.826 --> 09:56.628
But you can help me now.

09:56.630 --> 09:58.897
Oh, my god.

09:58.899 --> 10:01.199
Ju... Julia, is that...
- marina.

10:01.201 --> 10:04.002
She helped me bait a trap
for Reynard.

10:04.004 --> 10:06.705
He killed her.
- You freeze-dried her corpse?

10:06.707 --> 10:08.607
- Alonso's reverse
thermogenesis.

10:08.609 --> 10:10.942
But look...

10:10.944 --> 10:13.378
She left this for a reason...

10:13.380 --> 10:14.779
A message or a code.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.081
I mean, at least
I thought that...

10:16.083 --> 10:17.816
- no, no.
I know exactly what that is.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.718
That's a locator number...

10:19.720 --> 10:22.687
For a book in the library
at Brakebills.

10:37.903 --> 10:39.337
- Be careful.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.940
That's a long
drop for human legs.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.908
We would not want to see you
get hurt

10:43.910 --> 10:47.212
so soon after being rebuilt.

10:47.214 --> 10:49.247
- "Rebuilt"?

10:53.152 --> 10:55.654
It's strange, I know.

10:55.656 --> 10:56.921
But you'll get used to it.

10:56.923 --> 10:58.423
- Is this a hospital?

10:58.425 --> 11:02.027
Are you... are you a doctor?
- You're at the retreat...

11:02.029 --> 11:04.329
A few hours gallop north
of Whitespire.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.431
I was a patient years ago.

11:06.433 --> 11:09.267
The centaurs saved my life
when no one else could.

11:09.269 --> 11:12.337
Now I try to repay that debt
by serving them as a nurse.

11:12.339 --> 11:14.839
- The centaurs?
- Mm-hmm.

11:14.841 --> 11:16.207
- Horse people.

11:16.209 --> 11:18.309
- Mm-hmm.
- How... how long have I...

11:18.311 --> 11:22.213
- three weeks.
Your injuries were severe.

11:22.215 --> 11:25.450
Your friends were called away,
but they left that for you.

11:28.187 --> 11:30.422
We can start physical therapy
in the morning.

11:49.275 --> 11:50.875
<i>- "Dear Q,</i>

11:50.877 --> 11:52.444
<i>"we buried Alice today
in the gardens,</i>

11:52.446 --> 11:54.379
<i>"where she'll
always be close by.</i>

11:54.381 --> 11:58.149
<i>"We left a box of her things,
if you ever wake up.</i>

11:58.151 --> 12:00.285
<i>"Please wake up.</i>

12:00.287 --> 12:03.722
<i>Your benevolent overlord,
high king Eliot."</i>

12:16.402 --> 12:18.937
Hey.

12:21.208 --> 12:25.276
- Margo sent me here
to get my hands checked out.

12:25.278 --> 12:29.047
Look...

12:29.049 --> 12:30.448
It sucks about Alice.

12:30.450 --> 12:32.917
- "Sucks"?

12:32.919 --> 12:34.319
That's the best that you can do?

12:34.321 --> 12:35.987
- I cared about her, too.

12:35.989 --> 12:38.156
- For what, like, ten minutes,
including foreplay?

12:38.158 --> 12:40.091
- Are you mad at me because
I cared too much or too little?

12:40.093 --> 12:42.060
- I'm mad 'cause you fucked up
the one thing that

12:42.062 --> 12:44.429
we were counting on you for.
- You want to blame me?

12:44.431 --> 12:46.164
It was your cacodemon
that killed her.

12:46.166 --> 12:48.433
- That was not Alice.
Alice was gone.

12:48.435 --> 12:51.536
- So you just saved
the day, huh?

12:51.538 --> 12:54.272
- Could we just...

12:54.274 --> 12:57.108
Convalesce from our horrible
injuries separately, please?

13:01.113 --> 13:03.181
- Nice to see you, too, man.

13:10.489 --> 13:13.558
- Good day. My name is sawbones.
I'll be examining you.

13:16.162 --> 13:18.062
Ugh!

13:18.064 --> 13:20.064
Those are the most accursed
things I've ever smelled.

13:20.066 --> 13:23.501
They must be removed posthaste.

13:23.503 --> 13:25.136
How did they become cursed?

13:25.138 --> 13:27.005
- Uh...

13:27.007 --> 13:30.074
Some guy, this... this valet type
of dude at Chatwin's torrent.

13:30.076 --> 13:32.343
- The river watcher.
- You know him?

13:32.345 --> 13:34.279
- I'm sorry.
I-i can't help you.

13:34.281 --> 13:35.480
- Dude, just chop 'em off
and give me

13:35.482 --> 13:37.248
some magic wooden shit
like you did Quentin.

13:37.250 --> 13:39.350
- I'm a surgeon.
I can't risk the curse

13:39.352 --> 13:40.552
spreading to my own hands.

13:40.554 --> 13:42.554
The river watcher...

13:42.556 --> 13:45.089
He's mercurial and dangerous.

13:45.091 --> 13:49.527
You erred greatly
in offending him, penny.

13:51.832 --> 13:53.531
- Did you...

13:53.533 --> 13:57.602
Are you shitting?

13:57.604 --> 14:00.371
- You're welcome.

14:03.243 --> 14:06.444
What was I saying?

14:06.446 --> 14:08.379
- Me likey.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.515
- You're thinking about
banging yourself, aren't you?

14:10.517 --> 14:11.549
- Shh, shh, shh.

14:11.551 --> 14:13.384
No, no.

14:13.386 --> 14:17.355
Doing your clone is more like
AP-level masturbation.

14:17.357 --> 14:20.191
- Ugh, put on a robe, would you?

14:25.397 --> 14:28.266
- Aww.
- Now, part two...

14:28.268 --> 14:30.568
A variation
on the mind-control work

14:30.570 --> 14:33.204
Mayakovsky hammered us
with first year.

14:33.206 --> 14:36.140
You sleep here, your mind
goes into the golem.

14:36.142 --> 14:37.575
- And the golem
goes to Brakebills,

14:37.577 --> 14:39.410
unless, of course, we're wrong
about the fine print

14:39.412 --> 14:42.247
in my contract and he can't
leave Fillory either.

14:42.249 --> 14:44.482
- Yeah, totally possible
he touches a button

14:44.484 --> 14:47.285
and just explodes.

14:47.287 --> 14:50.188
Only one way to find out.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.062
- Richard's alumni key.

14:58.064 --> 15:00.198
It gets you past the wards
at Brakebills.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.466
- I was expelled.

15:01.468 --> 15:03.401
Alarm bells will go off
the second I pop in.

15:03.403 --> 15:04.602
- I didn't go to school there.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.504
I mean, how am I supposed
to find this book?

15:06.506 --> 15:09.374
"Best bitches"?

15:09.376 --> 15:11.342
It's the only one
the bodega had.

15:32.464 --> 15:35.566
<i>Okay, bitch, say something.</i>

15:38.170 --> 15:43.141
- You seeing this?
- Head down this row.

15:43.143 --> 15:45.677
Wait. Yeah, that room
on your left.

15:45.679 --> 15:47.512
<i>It's got an anti-decay charm
on it.</i>

15:47.514 --> 15:49.681
<i>It's where they keep
the good shit.</i>

15:55.621 --> 15:58.489
<i>- Got it.</i>
- What?

15:58.491 --> 16:03.294
Wait, let me see.
Hold it up.

16:03.296 --> 16:06.130
Wait, flip it to the back.

16:06.132 --> 16:09.400
Damn it.
It's like a library lojack.

16:09.402 --> 16:10.735
It'll go off if you try
to take the book

16:10.737 --> 16:12.437
outside the Brakebills wards.

16:12.439 --> 16:14.372
<i>- I mean, this will take hours
to copy.</i>

16:14.374 --> 16:15.673
<i>Someone's gonna notice me.</i>

16:15.675 --> 16:19.510
- Well, not if you know
the right place to hide.

16:28.388 --> 16:31.723
- Okay.
Didn't explode so far.

16:33.492 --> 16:35.727
Why does everything smell
so great?

16:35.729 --> 16:38.763
- Because your doppelganger
hasn't met cocaine yet.

16:38.765 --> 16:43.434
Todd! Todd! Todd!
Todd! Todd! Todd!

16:43.436 --> 16:46.337
- Why is everyone
cheering for...

16:46.339 --> 16:49.307
Todd?
- Oh, hey.

16:49.309 --> 16:51.676
You guys!

16:51.678 --> 16:53.411
- You made a lot
of friends, huh?

16:53.413 --> 16:54.779
- I heard you guys were dead.

16:54.781 --> 16:58.683
So I threw this massive rager
in your honor.

16:58.685 --> 17:01.285
- The fact that you just
called it a rager sickens me.

17:01.287 --> 17:04.555
- Thing is, it went great,

17:04.557 --> 17:08.393
and everyone had so much fun
that I kind of...

17:08.395 --> 17:10.028
- Became the new me.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.733
- Todd, answer truthfully.

17:15.734 --> 17:17.535
Are you wearing my vest?

17:17.537 --> 17:22.272
- I am wearing your vest.

17:22.275 --> 17:23.708
- Keep it.

17:23.710 --> 17:26.644
New plan...
I give up on Fillory

17:26.646 --> 17:29.380
and dedicate myself completely
to destroying Todd.

17:29.382 --> 17:32.316
- Oh, it's just Todd.
- "Just Todd"?

17:32.318 --> 17:34.752
He's usurping me.
My entire kingdom is at stake.

17:34.754 --> 17:37.655
- Your actual kingdom
is actually at stake.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.357
- There are some things
more important

17:39.359 --> 17:40.525
than saving an entire world.

17:40.527 --> 17:42.060
- Okay, I'm gonna go out
on a limb

17:42.062 --> 17:45.063
and say this isn't really
about Todd.

17:47.599 --> 17:49.667
- You don't say, Margo.

17:49.669 --> 17:52.403
- No killing Todd.

17:54.306 --> 17:55.740
Fucking Todd.

18:30.742 --> 18:32.743
- is this a bad time?

18:35.647 --> 18:37.682
Come sit over here.

18:40.519 --> 18:43.821
- I saw a-a... Strange woman.

18:43.823 --> 18:47.425
She's... Pale and had...

18:47.427 --> 18:49.293
Horn things.

18:49.295 --> 18:51.662
- You've seen the white lady.

18:51.664 --> 18:53.664
- I'm sorry.
"White lady?"

18:53.666 --> 18:55.867
- You are fortunate
she offered herself

18:55.869 --> 18:57.535
to some centaur's sight

18:57.537 --> 18:59.737
while you happened
to be watching.

19:05.410 --> 19:09.380
- Is that...
- Mm, skin.

19:09.382 --> 19:12.150
It won't feel,
but it might help you forget

19:12.152 --> 19:13.651
what's underneath.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.671
Get up, Coldwater!

19:33.673 --> 19:35.339
- What... what happened?

19:35.341 --> 19:37.542
- My hands tried to kill me,
so I broke my own arms.

19:37.544 --> 19:39.644
Look, forget all the mean shit
I said to you earlier.

19:39.646 --> 19:42.547
The bronies can't fix me.
I need your help.

19:42.549 --> 19:43.781
- Okay, I guess.

19:43.783 --> 19:47.485
- First things first...
Find an ax.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.257
- Are you sure about this?

19:53.259 --> 19:55.393
- Do you know how strong
booze has to be

19:55.395 --> 19:57.962
to get a horse drunk?

19:59.832 --> 20:02.200
I c... I ca...
I can't feel my face,

20:02.202 --> 20:04.468
much less my face...

20:04.470 --> 20:08.372
I mean hands.

20:08.374 --> 20:09.574
Just do it.

20:09.576 --> 20:12.877
- I'm going to.
Jeez.

20:16.382 --> 20:17.381
Nope.

20:17.383 --> 20:19.483
- Damn it, Quentin!

20:19.485 --> 20:21.385
- Sorry, I just... I panicked.
I don't love blood.

20:21.387 --> 20:22.920
- Who loves blood?

20:22.922 --> 20:25.423
I'm not gonna feel anything,
so fucking go!

20:25.425 --> 20:26.991
- I don't think I can do this.
- Oh, my god!

20:26.993 --> 20:28.559
I knew I fucking couldn't
count on you!

20:28.561 --> 20:31.963
You are so fucking pathetic,
you... you... you floppy-haired,

20:31.965 --> 20:33.931
limp dicked dork.

20:33.933 --> 20:36.434
Fucking... no wonder Alice
couldn't get off on you.

20:36.436 --> 20:38.269
You have no fuck... aah!
- Aah!

20:38.271 --> 20:39.870
- Oh, I fucking feel it!
- Okay, okay!

20:39.872 --> 20:42.240
- Oh, what did you do?
- I can fix it! I can fix it!

20:53.553 --> 20:55.286
- Oh, I wouldn't.

20:55.288 --> 20:56.921
Todd made that.
It's vile.

21:02.461 --> 21:05.596
Here.

21:07.567 --> 21:10.268
Mmm.
Delicious.

21:11.436 --> 21:13.504
- I'm Eliot.
- Javier.

21:13.506 --> 21:15.973
- You're a first-year?

21:15.975 --> 21:17.408
- Second-year.

21:17.410 --> 21:19.577
<i>Universidad De Asombro</i> in Spain.

21:19.579 --> 21:21.479
I'm here
for the welters tournament.

21:21.481 --> 21:22.680
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

21:22.682 --> 21:24.615
- I would make a joke
about ball handling,

21:24.617 --> 21:27.718
but I'm deadly serious
about ball handling.

21:27.720 --> 21:30.388
- Me too.
- Mm.

21:30.390 --> 21:32.323
Listen, Javier, I could
keep this up all night...

21:32.325 --> 21:34.659
- So could I.
- But I have to reclaim my title

21:34.661 --> 21:36.027
as the life of this
and every party

21:36.029 --> 21:37.528
by making a drink so perfect...

21:37.530 --> 21:41.666
- it seems like you need
to relax.

21:41.668 --> 21:43.634
- I'm married...

21:43.636 --> 21:44.902
To a woman.

21:44.904 --> 21:46.537
- I have a boyfriend.

21:46.539 --> 21:49.040
But he's on another
continent, so...

21:49.042 --> 21:51.542
It doesn't count.

21:51.544 --> 21:54.312
And where is your wife?

21:54.314 --> 21:55.579
- On another planet.

21:55.581 --> 21:58.649
Definitely doesn't count.

22:09.729 --> 22:12.496
- Ahh.
It's working.

22:12.498 --> 22:13.664
<i>- ¿Qué?</i>

22:13.666 --> 22:15.066
- Nothing.
Back at it.

22:20.039 --> 22:21.706
Eliot?

22:21.708 --> 22:25.042
Hey. You were talking
in your sleep.

22:25.044 --> 22:26.777
- What... what did you do?

22:26.779 --> 22:30.648
- I'm sorry. I get a little bit
enthusiastic sometimes.

22:30.650 --> 22:31.716
I'll be gentle.

22:31.718 --> 22:33.417
- You've been in bed all day.

22:33.419 --> 22:35.119
I came to check on you.

22:35.121 --> 22:38.122
- I'm fine.
I'm f-f-fine.

22:38.124 --> 22:40.758
- Uh, are you sure
you still want...

22:40.760 --> 22:42.393
- uh, i-i do.

22:42.395 --> 22:43.561
- What?
- I do...

22:43.563 --> 22:45.996
Want to tell you I'm sorry.

22:45.998 --> 22:48.499
I'm so sorry.
- For what?

22:48.501 --> 22:49.633
- Um...

22:49.635 --> 22:51.736
- I'm gonna go.

22:51.738 --> 22:53.671
- Um...

22:53.673 --> 22:55.806
No, no. No, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

22:55.808 --> 22:57.808
I-i absolutely want
to have sex right now.

22:57.810 --> 23:00.544
- You do?

23:00.546 --> 23:03.013
- Yeah.

23:08.553 --> 23:10.554
Ah...

23:12.824 --> 23:14.125
This is interesting.

23:14.127 --> 23:16.060
Do you want me to stop?

23:16.062 --> 23:18.763
- Uh...

23:42.120 --> 23:45.423
- Good morning, Quentin.
- How's penny?

23:45.425 --> 23:48.726
- He lost a lot of blood,
but he'll live.

23:48.728 --> 23:50.661
You're ready
for physical therapy.

23:50.663 --> 23:53.497
Some calisthenics maybe
or core work?

23:53.499 --> 23:55.699
- I had something else
in mind, actually.

24:30.469 --> 24:33.471
- You're exactly as good with
a bow as you are with an ax.

24:33.473 --> 24:36.507
Since I was a kid, the beast has
been whispering shit in my ear.

24:36.509 --> 24:38.909
Now that he's dead, the world's
gotten a lot quieter...

24:38.911 --> 24:41.512
Or would be
if not for you out here

24:41.514 --> 24:44.915
thinking low-self-esteem shit.

24:44.917 --> 24:47.885
- I'll re-do my wards.

24:47.887 --> 24:50.120
- There's something
in the Declan text

24:50.122 --> 24:52.223
about making arrows
fly straight.

24:52.225 --> 24:53.591
- Show me.

24:53.593 --> 24:54.925
- If I had middle fingers,

24:54.927 --> 24:56.660
you know what they'd be doing
right now?

24:56.662 --> 24:58.562
Start with popper 31.

25:04.570 --> 25:07.238
- Now cross your index
and ring fingers.

25:07.240 --> 25:10.641
No, under the middle.

25:10.643 --> 25:13.544
Now slide the thumb
along the meridian.

25:13.546 --> 25:15.145
Now draw the arrow back.

25:22.587 --> 25:24.688
- Thank you.
- Thank me by shutting up.

25:24.690 --> 25:27.558
- There's a creature
called the white lady.

25:27.560 --> 25:28.959
I saw her yesterday.

25:28.961 --> 25:31.629
She's one of the seven
questing creatures of Fillory.

25:31.631 --> 25:34.832
If you can catch her, she has
to give you whatever you ask.

25:34.834 --> 25:36.867
Plover wrote about her,
called her the winter's Doe.

25:36.869 --> 25:38.969
She lives in the darkling wood.

25:38.971 --> 25:40.571
It's just past
the flying forest.

25:40.573 --> 25:43.607
It's not far from here.

25:43.609 --> 25:45.142
We could hunt her together.

25:45.144 --> 25:47.845
- "Let's go hunt
the white lady"?

25:47.847 --> 25:50.314
People like me get shot
for saying shit like that.

25:50.316 --> 25:52.816
- She can give you
your hands back.

25:52.818 --> 25:54.885
- What's in it for you?

25:54.887 --> 25:57.555
- I'm gonna ask her
to bring Alice back to life.

26:07.198 --> 26:10.701
- The river we crossed
was at the edge of it.

26:10.703 --> 26:14.104
So we're in the flying forest.

26:14.106 --> 26:17.207
- What? Shouldn't the trees be,
like, flying and shit?

26:17.209 --> 26:20.911
- Yeah, actually.
Most of them are crepuscular.

26:20.913 --> 26:24.114
It means they're active
at dawn and dusk.

26:24.116 --> 26:26.116
- You smell that?

26:26.118 --> 26:27.718
It smells like...

26:27.720 --> 26:30.120
- Good.

26:30.122 --> 26:32.089
What is that?

26:32.091 --> 26:34.124
- I don't know.

26:34.126 --> 26:38.028
I Th... I think I'm...
I'm getting a contact high.

26:38.030 --> 26:40.965
- Yeah. Definitely starting
to feel something.

26:40.967 --> 26:44.835
Flying forest.

26:46.872 --> 26:48.238
- Oh, my god.

26:48.240 --> 26:50.274
The Chatwins were, like, ten
when they came through here.

26:50.276 --> 26:52.209
They must have been blazed
the entire time.

26:52.211 --> 26:54.812
- Super inappropriate.

26:54.814 --> 26:56.280
- Hey, i-i take back
what I said.

26:56.282 --> 26:58.716
I-i fully expect
to see

26:58.718 --> 27:00.818
a tree flapping around
at any second.

27:00.820 --> 27:03.087
- Listen, Quincy,
if we get a tree or...

27:03.089 --> 27:05.823
- did you just call me Quincy?

27:08.026 --> 27:11.128
- Is... is that not
your name?

27:15.033 --> 27:16.934
Dude...

27:16.936 --> 27:18.869
Dude, what the fuck?

27:18.871 --> 27:20.838
Get away from my mouth, man.
- It's my mouth.

27:20.840 --> 27:22.272
- Uh...
- No, it's not.

27:22.274 --> 27:24.074
- Oh.

27:24.076 --> 27:26.677
Oh, where...
Uh, where...

27:26.679 --> 27:27.911
Where are my stuff touchers?

27:27.913 --> 27:29.179
Aah! Ooh!

27:29.181 --> 27:31.915
What the fuck is going on?

27:31.917 --> 27:35.185
Who the fuck are you?

27:35.187 --> 27:38.055
Who am I?

27:38.057 --> 27:40.157
I have no idea.

27:40.159 --> 27:43.060
Okay.

27:43.062 --> 27:47.197
The beast shit
in the wellspring.

27:47.199 --> 27:49.733
- No. No.
Ember.

27:49.735 --> 27:52.236
Ember shat in the wellspring.

27:52.238 --> 27:54.705
I think he meant well.

27:54.707 --> 27:56.306
He probably didn't know

27:56.308 --> 27:58.976
how hard it would be
to clean out.

27:58.978 --> 28:03.347
- And now magic is failing
on earth...

28:03.349 --> 28:04.982
Because of shit,

28:04.984 --> 28:07.184
proving once again
that comedy and tragedy

28:07.186 --> 28:09.953
can coexist
in the same goddamn sentence.

28:11.990 --> 28:15.225
Honestly...

28:15.227 --> 28:17.027
I am in over my head.

28:17.029 --> 28:19.863
I am not even in control
of which world

28:19.865 --> 28:22.132
my body is awake in,
and my sexually aggressive wife,

28:22.134 --> 28:24.068
she could wake me up
at any moment in Fillory.

28:24.070 --> 28:26.236
- Eliot, there are certain
student/teacher boundaries

28:26.238 --> 28:28.305
which I'd prefer not to cross.

28:28.307 --> 28:30.174
- So what am I supposed
to do, Henry?

28:30.176 --> 28:31.975
- What did you think
was going to happen

28:31.977 --> 28:34.878
when you dove headfirst
into another world?

28:41.853 --> 28:43.053
- I thought I'd die.

28:43.055 --> 28:45.089
- But you didn't.

28:45.091 --> 28:47.891
Now you have two lives.

28:47.893 --> 28:49.126
You're trying to live both.

28:49.128 --> 28:51.261
- Yes.
- Yes, but you can't.

28:51.263 --> 28:53.130
That's stupid.

28:53.132 --> 28:54.932
You can let it tear you in half

28:54.934 --> 28:57.267
or pick one.

28:57.269 --> 28:59.103
- I can never leave Fillory.

28:59.105 --> 29:01.105
- The choice is easy.

29:03.174 --> 29:05.175
- I am...

29:05.177 --> 29:07.277
Ill-equipped to be a king.

29:07.279 --> 29:09.880
- I am no better equipped
to teach one.

29:09.882 --> 29:13.951
Being an adult is recognizing
your responsibilities.

29:13.953 --> 29:17.855
A bunch of my students went
and conquered another world.

29:17.857 --> 29:19.790
- They more, like,
gave it to us.

29:19.792 --> 29:22.059
- Either way,
it doesn't look great for me.

29:22.061 --> 29:24.995
It reeks of earth privilege.

29:24.997 --> 29:27.231
The very least I can do is...

29:27.233 --> 29:28.832
Is to help you rule it.

29:31.302 --> 29:33.137
- What do you have in mind?

29:33.139 --> 29:35.439
- Bring in
the best minds we can...

29:35.441 --> 29:37.975
Historians, politicians,

29:37.977 --> 29:41.879
shamans, military leaders.

29:41.881 --> 29:46.283
Hmm.
Your thesis project is...

29:46.285 --> 29:49.953
"How to save
an entire goddamn world."

29:59.297 --> 30:02.966
- Right or left?

30:02.968 --> 30:06.270
- Right seems to be
the popular direction.

30:11.309 --> 30:12.910
- I must be an adventurer.

30:12.912 --> 30:15.078
No, you're not.

30:15.080 --> 30:17.047
- What?
I have a bow and arrow

30:17.049 --> 30:20.984
and a cool questing outfit
and a manservant.

30:20.986 --> 30:24.154
- Oh-ho-ho, you did not
just say that, white boy.

30:24.156 --> 30:28.292
Besides, what kind of servant
has no fucking hands?

30:32.330 --> 30:35.399
- Right or left?

30:35.401 --> 30:37.901
- Right seems to be
the popular direction.

30:43.174 --> 30:46.176
Julia?

30:47.979 --> 30:49.479
What the hell
are you doing here?

30:49.481 --> 30:51.348
- Look, I can explain.
- No.

30:51.350 --> 30:53.350
After you jumped in and screwed
everything up with penny,

30:53.352 --> 30:56.320
Alice died killing
your little friend Martin.

30:56.322 --> 30:59.156
Then Quentin was almost
ripped in half.

30:59.158 --> 31:01.491
And you have the balls
to come here.

31:01.493 --> 31:03.060
- Look, if you guys
had trusted me,

31:03.062 --> 31:04.494
both Reynard and the beast
would be dead.

31:04.496 --> 31:06.330
None of that
would have happened.

31:06.332 --> 31:08.265
- Quentin should have left you
in your little hedge hole,

31:08.267 --> 31:10.500
trading rim jobs for spells.

31:10.502 --> 31:13.303
- You actually think because
you go to this bullshit school

31:13.305 --> 31:15.005
that you're better than me.

31:15.007 --> 31:17.908
- I think I didn't get
my friends killed.

31:17.910 --> 31:19.943
- You don't have friends.

31:19.945 --> 31:22.112
You have people
that are so afraid of you,

31:22.114 --> 31:24.448
they'd rather be on your side.

31:24.450 --> 31:28.418
There's a difference.

31:28.420 --> 31:31.154
- Well...

31:31.156 --> 31:34.024
And you have no one.

31:34.026 --> 31:35.926
And you deserve no one.

31:35.928 --> 31:37.294
- Look,
I don't expect you to care

31:37.296 --> 31:39.129
'cause this doesn't directly
affect your hair

31:39.131 --> 31:42.099
or your social life,
but since you let Reynard free,

31:42.101 --> 31:44.034
he has murdered
over a dozen women,

31:44.036 --> 31:46.303
and this book might be
my last shot at killing him.

31:59.183 --> 32:01.151
- The book's blank.

32:01.153 --> 32:04.121
Put yours in the box
and wait for them to mate.

32:04.123 --> 32:07.491
The baby should be a pretty
decent xerox of the original.

32:27.279 --> 32:30.147
- You know what this is?

32:30.149 --> 32:32.149
Ooh, this is a girl's.

32:34.953 --> 32:38.422
What if I'm supposed to be
rescuing her?

32:38.424 --> 32:41.491
- Ooh, or what if
you're a stalker?

32:41.493 --> 32:43.493
- Right or left?

32:46.230 --> 32:49.499
- Right seems to be
the popular direction.

32:49.501 --> 32:51.969
- Wait, no.

32:51.971 --> 32:54.504
If I'm supposed
to find her, I...

32:54.506 --> 32:57.507
I have to look
where no one else is searching.

32:57.509 --> 32:59.509
- What?

33:12.490 --> 33:15.292
- Penny.

33:15.294 --> 33:18.195
Douche bag.

33:20.698 --> 33:23.734
The effect of the weed forest
is wearing off.

33:27.171 --> 33:28.739
- Oh, my god.

33:32.277 --> 33:35.245
It's Alice. Uh...

33:36.314 --> 33:38.782
- Quentin, look, I...

33:38.784 --> 33:42.619
I know how you feel, man.

33:42.621 --> 33:46.757
Before, when your wards
were slipping, I...

33:46.759 --> 33:49.292
I know.

33:51.462 --> 33:54.564
- I can't.
- No, hey, no, no. Listen.

33:54.566 --> 33:57.267
You... you can't...

33:57.269 --> 34:00.037
You can't puss out right now.

34:00.039 --> 34:02.506
Think about Alice.
She needs you, man.

34:04.575 --> 34:06.743
I need you.

34:16.654 --> 34:18.221
- Hey.

34:18.223 --> 34:19.589
- Hey.

34:19.591 --> 34:21.757
- So I've been thinking.

34:21.760 --> 34:25.728
Is 100 feet really tall enough
for Alice's memorial?

34:25.731 --> 34:28.697
- We weren't her friends,
remember?

34:35.306 --> 34:38.742
- We owe it to her...

34:38.744 --> 34:41.511
Because we weren't her friends.

34:45.616 --> 34:48.351
- We don't have the money.

34:48.353 --> 34:51.288
- We're magicians.

34:51.290 --> 34:53.623
Let's build it ourselves.

34:55.525 --> 34:58.762
- Look, what Margo said
about me was true.

34:58.764 --> 35:02.365
So if... if you want to bail,
now's your chance.

35:02.367 --> 35:05.602
- Well, you do have
questionable judgment.

35:05.604 --> 35:08.705
I mean,
we're best bitches, right?

35:08.707 --> 35:10.674
For better or for worse.

35:10.676 --> 35:11.842
- God.

35:14.612 --> 35:16.413
- Wait a minute.

35:16.415 --> 35:18.415
I know why marina
wanted me to find the book.

35:18.417 --> 35:20.750
- Why?
- It's a necromancy spell.

35:20.752 --> 35:24.554
- As in bring back to life?

35:24.556 --> 35:26.289
No, no fucking way.

35:26.291 --> 35:28.658
- Kady...
- She killed my mother.

35:28.660 --> 35:30.660
- Look, the effects
are unstable.

35:30.662 --> 35:33.830
It'll only last a few minutes,
and then she goes away again.

35:33.832 --> 35:35.465
- Fine.

35:37.668 --> 35:39.603
Fine.
Let's defrost the bitch.

35:43.908 --> 35:48.311
It says the last ingredient
is the book itself.

35:48.313 --> 35:50.313
- Then we got one chance.

36:03.662 --> 36:06.596
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

36:06.598 --> 36:07.931
It's okay.
It's okay.

36:07.933 --> 36:09.833
My skin is so cold.

36:09.835 --> 36:11.735
- It's okay. Look at me, please.
- You... you brought me back...

36:11.737 --> 36:13.470
- you had a message
you wanted to tell me.

36:13.472 --> 36:15.705
- I'm gonna die.
- We don't have that much time.

36:15.707 --> 36:17.707
- You don't understand.
You don't know where I was.

36:17.709 --> 36:19.843
I don't want to go back there.
I don't want to go back there.

36:19.845 --> 36:21.645
- Marina, your clock
is running out, okay?

36:21.647 --> 36:23.680
Please, you are the strongest
person that I have ever met.

36:23.682 --> 36:25.448
I need you to pull it
together now,

36:25.450 --> 36:26.850
and I need you to tell me.

36:26.852 --> 36:30.554
- I need you to tell me
about the thing that killed you.

36:33.525 --> 36:35.192
You can stop him, Julia.

36:35.194 --> 36:38.495
It is possible,
but you need to do it.

36:38.497 --> 36:40.897
You need to do it.
- Okay, what?

36:40.899 --> 36:42.599
What do I need to do?

36:42.601 --> 36:45.602
- There was... A girl.

36:45.604 --> 36:49.739
40 years ago,
she banished Reynard from earth.

36:49.741 --> 36:51.875
That's where he was
until you summoned him.

36:51.877 --> 36:54.778
That's where he was
until you brought him back.

36:54.780 --> 36:57.647
I'm sorr... I'm sorry.

37:17.835 --> 37:19.836
- Shh.

37:56.974 --> 37:59.442
- Hi.

37:59.444 --> 38:01.945
Don't run.

38:01.947 --> 38:03.980
Are you gonna?

38:06.484 --> 38:08.051
- What's the deal?

38:08.053 --> 38:12.022
- I don't know.
She's kind of ignoring me.

38:12.024 --> 38:14.524
- Yo, white lady, we caught you.

38:14.526 --> 38:18.495
- Hey, show some respect.

38:18.497 --> 38:22.432
- Pardon me...
Miss lady?

38:22.434 --> 38:24.301
- It hurts.

38:24.303 --> 38:26.970
- Uh, sorry.
Uh...

38:26.972 --> 38:28.471
- Why have you come?

38:28.473 --> 38:29.806
- That's my arrow.

38:29.808 --> 38:31.408
You have to give me what I ask.

38:31.410 --> 38:34.744
- Obviously, you turd.

38:41.052 --> 38:43.320
Look at you.

38:43.322 --> 38:47.090
Someone's been rebuilt...

38:47.092 --> 38:49.326
And so cleverly.

38:55.433 --> 38:57.434
Mm.

38:58.836 --> 39:00.837
Feel that?

39:02.440 --> 39:04.441
- Could you not?

39:04.443 --> 39:06.476
- Here's a riddle.

39:06.478 --> 39:07.944
How much do you have to lose

39:07.946 --> 39:10.480
before you're no longer
yourself?

39:10.482 --> 39:12.449
- I don't know.
Why don't you tell me?

39:12.451 --> 39:14.484
- What is it, Quentin Coldwater,

39:14.486 --> 39:16.119
that you ache for?

39:16.121 --> 39:18.088
You have a crown

39:18.090 --> 39:21.858
and the power to reshape
the very ether to your whim.

39:21.860 --> 39:25.428
What else could you
possibly want?

39:25.430 --> 39:29.132
- Um, technically speaking,
uh, we both caught you, so...

39:29.134 --> 39:31.368
- Shut up. I'll ask for your
thing with my third wish.

39:31.370 --> 39:34.003
- No.
We each get a wish,

39:34.005 --> 39:36.840
and then we have one
mutually agreeable third wish.

39:36.842 --> 39:38.875
- You can each have one wish,
or you can fuck off.

39:38.877 --> 39:40.076
- Okay.

39:43.414 --> 39:45.548
Alice Quinn...

39:46.917 --> 39:48.818
Bring her back to life...

39:50.788 --> 39:53.957
Please.

39:53.959 --> 39:56.459
- I can't.

39:56.461 --> 39:58.595
- What do you mean you can't?

39:58.597 --> 40:01.898
You are not the only magical
creature in this fucking forest.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.400
- True.

40:03.402 --> 40:05.502
And we all have limits.

40:05.504 --> 40:07.604
We can give you anything.

40:07.606 --> 40:10.039
But we cannot Pierce that veil.

40:10.041 --> 40:12.041
Alice is gone.

40:20.618 --> 40:24.087
- My turn.

40:24.089 --> 40:25.955
I want my hands back.

40:25.957 --> 40:27.424
- That I can do.

40:33.965 --> 40:37.967
No!

40:39.871 --> 40:41.070
- What did you do to him?

40:41.072 --> 40:43.206
- That screaming was irritating.

40:43.208 --> 40:45.475
He'll wake when he's healed.

40:45.477 --> 40:48.511
Now, I can't nap
until I've granted your wish.

40:48.513 --> 40:50.847
- I'd like to be happy.
Could you do that?

40:50.849 --> 40:53.216
- I can do wonders.

40:53.218 --> 40:55.518
But you should know...

40:55.520 --> 40:59.956
There's nothing I can give you
that will soothe your shade.

40:59.958 --> 41:02.992
There's only
what I can take away.

41:02.994 --> 41:05.495
- You'd take away
my memories of Alice?

41:05.497 --> 41:08.198
- Yes.
I would free you completely.

41:11.168 --> 41:13.703
- No.

41:13.705 --> 41:17.474
- You are wiser than you appear.

41:17.476 --> 41:20.643
You would find your way
back to sadness,

41:20.645 --> 41:23.012
no matter how far
you run from it.

41:23.014 --> 41:25.548
- Well, that's comforting.

41:25.550 --> 41:29.219
- Is there nothing else
you desire?

41:29.221 --> 41:33.122
- Everything I've ever wanted,
I've got.

41:33.124 --> 41:37.060
