00:01.035 --> 00:02.970
**

00:14.515 --> 00:16.584
Owen: Kevin Gable,
please see the manager.

00:16.650 --> 00:19.520
Kevin Gable,
please see the manager.

00:23.057 --> 00:25.526
( Sighs )

00:25.593 --> 00:27.528
You, uh --
you wanted to see me, Owen?

00:27.595 --> 00:28.862
"Owen"?

00:30.598 --> 00:32.766
Sorry. Mr. Durning.

00:32.833 --> 00:35.903
Exactly. Like the name
on the sign out front.

00:35.969 --> 00:37.838
That's right --
my dad owns the place.

00:37.905 --> 00:40.841
You've mentioned that
a couple times.

00:40.908 --> 00:42.276
Here's the sitch.

00:42.343 --> 00:44.845
I noticed on the security
monitor that you popped

00:44.912 --> 00:47.881
a cube of cheese from Rose,
the sample lady.

00:47.948 --> 00:49.049
It was a free --
Don't deny it, chief.

00:49.117 --> 00:50.251
I see everything.

00:50.318 --> 00:51.652
I'm not denying it.
She asked me to try it.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.387
I don't know --
Is there a problem with that?

00:53.454 --> 00:55.256
Would there be a problem
if Homeless Joe came in here

00:55.323 --> 00:57.858
and started peeing
on the apricots?

00:57.925 --> 01:01.028
I didn't pee
on the cheese.

01:01.095 --> 01:03.431
Now, one more screw-up,
and it's your keys.

01:03.497 --> 01:04.965
The whole ring, chief.

01:06.234 --> 01:07.335
You feel me?

01:07.401 --> 01:08.802
I do.
I-I feel you.

01:08.869 --> 01:10.938
Then why are you
still here?

01:12.640 --> 01:14.675
I don't --
I don't know.

01:40.368 --> 01:45.005
* I am not your ordinary guy

01:46.740 --> 01:48.142
Hey.
Hey.

01:48.209 --> 01:49.877
Sorry I'm late.

01:49.943 --> 01:53.046
Did you know
All American Burger
is right across the street?

01:53.113 --> 01:55.416
I pulled in there by mistake.
It's like muscle memory.

01:55.483 --> 01:57.685
My body was like --
just wanted to go there.

01:57.751 --> 01:59.820
Yeah. Well, I'm glad
you made it here.

01:59.887 --> 02:01.689
And I know your policy
on foreign food --

02:01.755 --> 02:02.956
If you can't read it,
you don't eat it.

02:03.023 --> 02:04.091
That's right.

02:04.158 --> 02:05.526
What's the, uh --
what's the deal here?

02:05.593 --> 02:08.396
Do I got to take off my shoes?
Do I got to bow to anybody?

02:08.462 --> 02:09.797
It's Vietnamese.
No.

02:09.863 --> 02:11.031
Okay, well,
just so you know,

02:11.098 --> 02:12.866
I'm not eating anything raw --
anything, okay?

02:12.933 --> 02:14.602
And I don't want to cook
my own food, you know,

02:14.668 --> 02:15.969
where they put the hot rock
in the middle there

02:16.036 --> 02:17.605
and they're like, you know,
"Get to work."

02:17.671 --> 02:20.341
I'm like, "You get to work.
That's what
I'm paying you for."

02:20.408 --> 02:22.410
Honey, I know
all your food rules, okay?

02:22.476 --> 02:23.911
There's no rocks.
There's no raw food.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.479
There's
no sourdough bread.

02:25.546 --> 02:28.081
Why would I want
my bread sour, by the way?
Seriously, I mean...

02:28.148 --> 02:29.817
You're gonna love it,
all right?

02:29.883 --> 02:31.719
Oh, great.
Look at this.
What?

02:31.785 --> 02:35.088
I can see the sign
from All American.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.524
It says "urger."

02:36.590 --> 02:38.359
It says "urger," but I know
what they mean, and I know --

02:38.426 --> 02:40.127
We got to switch.
Switch with me.

02:40.194 --> 02:41.929
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Switch. Switch.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.998
It's like a lighthouse
calling you home.

02:46.099 --> 02:47.201
There we go.

02:47.268 --> 02:48.836
( Sighs )

02:48.902 --> 02:50.904
Well, I got to admit,
it was a nice surprise
to get your call.

02:50.971 --> 02:52.373
I thought you were gonna be
at the supermarket till 8:00.

02:52.440 --> 02:55.676
Oh, yeah, uh, cute story.
Um...

02:55.743 --> 02:57.211
There might have been
a little dustup

02:57.278 --> 02:59.547
involving
some cubes of cheese --

02:59.613 --> 03:00.814
that were complimentary,
by the way.

03:00.881 --> 03:03.050
Mm-hmm.
You quit?

03:03.116 --> 03:04.318
Yeah, I did.

03:04.385 --> 03:05.786
I also kissed Rose,
the sample lady --

03:05.853 --> 03:07.020
just to make a point.

03:08.556 --> 03:10.291
Wasn't sexy.
Her teeth shifted.

03:10.358 --> 03:12.793
It was weird.
I'm telling you.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.228
Should I be worried
about this?

03:14.295 --> 03:15.829
No! Trust me --
she's not gonna sue.

03:15.896 --> 03:18.799
She lit up like a candle.
I'm telling you.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.268
That's not what I mean.

03:20.334 --> 03:21.502
That's, like,
the fifth job

03:21.569 --> 03:23.537
you've walked out on
in two months.

03:23.604 --> 03:24.938
Honey, what's going on?

03:25.005 --> 03:26.240
( Sighs )

03:26.307 --> 03:27.875
I know we need extra money,
all right?

03:27.941 --> 03:30.611
But I just can't take
these kids bossing me
around anymore.

03:30.678 --> 03:31.912
Okay, well,
don't worry about the money.

03:31.979 --> 03:33.113
We'll figure that out.

03:33.180 --> 03:35.082
But you need to find something
that you like,

03:35.148 --> 03:36.684
something
you're passionate about.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.952
Yeah, I would love that.
That's awesome.

03:39.019 --> 03:40.053
Oh.
Oh.

03:40.120 --> 03:41.855
Thank you.
Thank you.

03:50.464 --> 03:52.165
What am I
looking at here?

03:52.232 --> 03:53.601
It's pho.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.869
It's what?
Pho.

03:55.936 --> 03:58.171
Well, pho looks like
a clogged sink.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.775
What are those chunks floating
around in there? What is that?

04:01.842 --> 04:03.377
It's chicken.
You love chicken.

04:03.444 --> 04:04.778
Did he make this outside?
What is this?

04:04.845 --> 04:07.080
Okay, babe,
it's seasoning!

04:07.147 --> 04:08.248
Just try it!

04:08.316 --> 04:09.850
Okay.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.022
Good?

04:18.759 --> 04:20.260
( Slurps )

04:25.499 --> 04:27.835
Hold the pho-one.

04:27.901 --> 04:28.969
Yeah!

04:29.036 --> 04:30.070
This is insane.

04:30.137 --> 04:31.138
This existed
this whole time,

04:31.204 --> 04:32.473
and you don't
tell me about it?

04:32.540 --> 04:33.774
Yeah, and wait
till you try the beef.

04:33.841 --> 04:35.843
This comes in beef?!

04:39.146 --> 04:42.850
**

04:42.916 --> 04:44.485
Oh, hey, babe.

04:44.552 --> 04:46.286
Ugh. Never be
a school nurse.

04:46.354 --> 04:48.155
I had to send two kids home
with chicken pox,

04:48.221 --> 04:49.890
and I'm so paranoid
that I have it.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.893
I'm, like, itchy.
Will you look at my back?

04:52.960 --> 04:54.662
Your back is fine.

04:56.163 --> 04:58.131
Where do you keep
peanut worm?

04:58.198 --> 04:59.800
Um...
Hey, hon,
where's our peanut worm?

04:59.867 --> 05:01.735
What...is happening?

05:01.802 --> 05:03.404
Let me get you caught up
to speed.
( Laughing ) Yeah.

05:03.471 --> 05:04.805
Remember that soup
that I loved last night?

05:04.872 --> 05:06.940
Yeah.
Well, Mr. Chu here,
he made it.

05:07.007 --> 05:08.876
Oh. Oh, Mr. Chu,
hi.

05:08.942 --> 05:11.445
We -- I showed him my back.
I'll tell you later.

05:12.413 --> 05:13.747
All right, anyway,
I went down

05:13.814 --> 05:16.249
to the restaurant today
and...

05:16.316 --> 05:18.786
Well, long story short,
Mr. Chu works for me now.

05:18.852 --> 05:20.120
Uh, with you.

05:20.187 --> 05:21.955
( Chuckles )
This guy's got no filter.

05:22.022 --> 05:24.291
He's crazy.
Um...

05:24.358 --> 05:25.593
Wait.
Working with you?

05:25.659 --> 05:27.327
What -- so you're opening
a Vietnamese restaurant?

05:27.395 --> 05:29.296
Well, that was
my first impulse,

05:29.363 --> 05:32.265
but then I cooled my jets
and put my business cap on.

05:32.332 --> 05:35.669
( High-pitched )
Chale, hit me up with it!

05:35.736 --> 05:38.806
90% of all new restaurants
go belly-up within a year.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.541
( Normal voice ) You know
what doesn't go belly-up?

05:40.608 --> 05:41.609
Food trucks.

05:41.675 --> 05:44.211
That feels like
it can't be true.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.213
Chale.

05:46.279 --> 05:47.981
A-Actually,
you're both right.

05:48.048 --> 05:51.452
But food trucks have
a much higher rate of success.

05:51.519 --> 05:55.355
And currently, there are none
on Long Island that sell pho.

05:55.423 --> 05:56.424
Thank you, Chale.

05:56.490 --> 05:57.858
However,
in my opinion --

05:57.925 --> 06:00.461
Okay, you know what? I will
point to you when I need you.

06:03.263 --> 06:05.766
So, yesterday,
you didn't know what pho was,

06:05.833 --> 06:07.668
and now we're in
the pho business?

06:07.735 --> 06:09.703
You told me to find something
I'm passionate about.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.872
Well, with this, I can be
my own boss, thanks to you.

06:11.939 --> 06:13.306
Okay, well,
that's great.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.142
But how much
is this gonna cost us?

06:15.208 --> 06:16.276
It's just 25 grand.

06:16.343 --> 06:17.645
( Chuckling ) What?!

06:17.711 --> 06:19.747
Honey!
We don't have 25 grand!

06:19.813 --> 06:22.315
No, no, but we can swing 5,
and for the rest,

06:22.382 --> 06:23.784
I brought in
some investors.

06:23.851 --> 06:26.887
Let's meet...the Sharks.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.725
Three retired
police officers

06:31.792 --> 06:34.227
searching for their slice
of the American dream.

06:34.294 --> 06:35.896
And my brother.

06:38.365 --> 06:39.967
So, they're
all into this?

06:40.033 --> 06:41.234
Not yet --
I got to pitch them.

06:41.301 --> 06:44.004
But if we get four yeses,
we're in business.

06:44.071 --> 06:45.138
Pho ready.

06:45.205 --> 06:47.174
Oh! Pho ready.
Let's do this.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.909
What? What?!
Showtime.

06:48.976 --> 06:50.043
Showtime!

06:50.110 --> 06:52.012
Oh, Chale,
please don't encourage him.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.147
I just want him
to like me.

06:55.082 --> 06:57.317
Gentlemen, good afternoon.

06:57.384 --> 07:01.955
I'd like to talk to you about
a little place called Vietnam.

07:02.022 --> 07:04.858
Country of mystery.

07:04.925 --> 07:08.529
Once our enemy,
now our friend.

07:08.596 --> 07:09.830
And at last, we can enjoy

07:09.897 --> 07:13.233
one of their finest
achievements -- pho.

07:13.300 --> 07:14.434
Pho?

07:14.502 --> 07:16.737
Yes. Don't let
the weird name scare you.

07:16.804 --> 07:18.271
Think of it
as a warm blanket

07:18.338 --> 07:20.373
from our friends
from the Far East.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.909
What's all this green stuff?

07:21.975 --> 07:24.411
This guy's like a caveman,
( Chuckling ) I swear.

07:24.478 --> 07:26.914
It's seasoning.
Give it a shot.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.849
Man, this is
actually really good.

07:28.916 --> 07:30.851
Kevin: Right?
I love the hunks of meat
at the bottom.

07:30.918 --> 07:34.221
It's like a --
a treasure hunt.
Duffy: Yeah.

07:34.287 --> 07:38.158
It's like a reward for pushing
away all the green stuff.

07:38.225 --> 07:39.760
You know what? I don't
really mind the green stuff.

07:39.827 --> 07:44.031
Minty -- like a cross between
lettuce and brushing my teeth.

07:44.097 --> 07:45.799
Okay, well, guys,
that's great,

07:45.866 --> 07:47.267
but is there even
a business plan?

07:47.334 --> 07:48.869
Because you can't have
a business without a plan.

07:48.936 --> 07:50.303
I couldn't agree more.
You know what?

07:50.370 --> 07:52.405
Chale,
slap the math on her!

07:52.472 --> 07:54.608
The food-service industry

07:54.675 --> 07:58.445
generates $782 billion
a year.

07:58.512 --> 08:01.549
If you were to make
just 1% of 1% of that,

08:01.615 --> 08:03.316
you would all
be quite wealthy.

08:03.383 --> 08:05.819
Do you hear that? Okay?
This is not soup.

08:05.886 --> 08:07.788
This is a ticket
to happiness!

08:07.855 --> 08:09.422
And what does
that ticket cost?

08:09.489 --> 08:11.559
Just $5,000.
$5,000.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.627
Per man.

08:13.694 --> 08:15.763
I don't know --
that's a lot of bacon.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.398
Mott,
can I ask you a question?

08:18.465 --> 08:19.499
Are you happy?

08:19.567 --> 08:20.968
I am.

08:21.034 --> 08:23.604
Mott, are you happy?

08:23.671 --> 08:24.938
Yeah, I'm -- I am.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.807
He's happy! He said
he's happy. Leave him alone.

08:26.874 --> 08:28.375
I'm just saying
I don't think he's happy.

08:28.441 --> 08:30.210
What?!
Mott. Look at me.

08:34.582 --> 08:35.949
I want you to focus now.

08:36.016 --> 08:38.619
Are...you...happy?

08:38.686 --> 08:39.753
I'm not happy?

08:39.820 --> 08:41.789
Thank you
for admitting that.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.356
That was big, okay?

08:43.423 --> 08:45.626
Now, Duffy, please,
let's be honest.

08:45.693 --> 08:48.328
We know you're financially
dependent on your mom.

08:48.395 --> 08:50.430
Don't you want
to break free of that?

08:50.497 --> 08:51.765
Yes, I do.

08:51.832 --> 08:54.001
Then you got to do it.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.402
You know what? You're right.
I'm gonna do it.

08:55.468 --> 08:56.804
I'll do it right now.
No, no, no, wait.

08:56.870 --> 09:00.373
You got to get the 5 grand
from Mommy first, and then...

09:00.440 --> 09:01.474
Kyle.

09:01.541 --> 09:02.576
Yeah. What?

09:02.643 --> 09:04.211
What's 5 grand
between brothers?

09:04.277 --> 09:06.747
( Chuckles ) I'll just pull it
from my fireman's
pension fund.

09:06.814 --> 09:08.248
Smart move.
Actually, it's not.

09:08.315 --> 09:10.851
There's, uh, crazy penalties
for early withdrawal.

09:10.918 --> 09:13.486
No, no, no, man, this whole
deal sounds too risky.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.889
'Cause it's a lot of risk.
It's a lot of risk.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.791
Yeah, but you know what?
We're betting on ourselves.

09:17.858 --> 09:18.926
That's
the difference here.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.193
You know what?
I just ran the numbers.

09:20.260 --> 09:21.729
I'm gonna have to take out
at least $7,000 to --

09:21.795 --> 09:23.563
Kyle,
nobody gives a crap.

09:23.631 --> 09:25.065
You know what --
I'm gonna take out $8,000,

09:25.132 --> 09:26.734
just to give myself
a little walking-around money.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.001
You know
what I'm saying?

09:28.068 --> 09:30.237
Duffy's in, right?
Kyle's in.

09:30.303 --> 09:31.538
Goody, it's up to you.

09:31.605 --> 09:33.641
Oh, man.
I'm in, too.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.408
Can't watch these guys
get rich without me.

09:35.475 --> 09:36.576
Yes!
I'm in.

09:36.644 --> 09:38.211
All right, Mott,
you are the missing piece.

09:38.278 --> 09:39.579
What am I doing?

09:39.647 --> 09:41.949
I'll just take out the full
$10,000 and treat myself.

09:43.751 --> 09:46.119
Look,
I got seven kids.

09:46.186 --> 09:49.389
Yeah, and that's
seven mouths to feed.

09:49.456 --> 09:51.659
But...I want to be happy.
I'm in.

09:51.725 --> 09:53.526
No!
We got
our four investors.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.263
Come on, honey.
I can't do this without you.

09:56.329 --> 09:57.397
Are we in?

09:57.464 --> 09:59.900
I -- Uh...

10:00.701 --> 10:02.469
Okay, fine! We're in.

10:02.535 --> 10:04.571
Awesome! 'Cause I already put
the down payment on the truck.

10:04.638 --> 10:06.239
( Cheering )

10:06.306 --> 10:07.908
**

10:12.512 --> 10:15.482
Hey, folks.
Kevin Gable -- CEO/founder.

10:15.548 --> 10:17.450
I'd ask you how the soup is,
but that electric smile

10:17.517 --> 10:19.286
tells me everything
I need to know.

10:19.352 --> 10:20.487
( Laughs )

10:20.553 --> 10:22.856
Once again, Kevin Gable --
CEO/founder.

10:22.923 --> 10:25.258
Hey. There you go.
Enjoy.

10:25.325 --> 10:27.728
We have been so busy all day.
You're a hit, Dad.

10:27.795 --> 10:29.496
I told you.
You having fun, sweetheart?

10:29.562 --> 10:31.498
Yeah. Slinging soup
in a hotbox for no pay?

10:31.564 --> 10:33.834
( Chuckles )
Living the dream.

10:33.901 --> 10:35.002
That's my girl.

10:35.068 --> 10:36.970
Hey, Mr. CEO, you want
to chop some onions?

10:37.037 --> 10:38.706
Sorry, Mr. Chu,
but I'm a little busy out here

10:38.772 --> 10:40.107
putting a face
with the brand, okay?

10:40.173 --> 10:41.842
No, you come in here,
take out the trash.

10:41.909 --> 10:43.744
( Laughing ) This guy
knows nothing about branding.

10:43.811 --> 10:44.878
You know what I'm saying?

10:44.945 --> 10:47.514
Anyway, Kevin Gable --
CEO and founder.

10:49.182 --> 10:51.719
Wow! Honey,
look at all these people!

10:51.785 --> 10:54.287
It's working.
Okay,
you sound surprised.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.056
I am. I mean,
I'm not gonna lie.

10:56.123 --> 10:57.124
I went
and got more insurance

10:57.190 --> 10:58.358
in case we had to
torch this puppy.

10:58.425 --> 10:59.893
( Chuckles )
That's funny.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.962
No, I'm serious.
I went and saw Jeannie
on the way over here.

11:02.029 --> 11:03.096
Okay.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.065
In the future,
next time I get a feeling,

11:05.132 --> 11:06.666
you might
want to ride with it.

11:06.734 --> 11:08.368
Okay, you're right,
you're right.

11:08.435 --> 11:11.071
So, what's a girl got to do
to get some pho around here?

11:11.138 --> 11:12.706
Oh, well, for you...
Yeah?

11:12.773 --> 11:14.207
...you got to wait in line
and pay.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.043
'Cause it's --
it's a business.
I'm running a business.

11:16.109 --> 11:17.745
Mm-hmm.
All right,
you're cute, kid.

11:17.811 --> 11:19.379
I'm gonna get you one.
Chicken or beef?

11:19.446 --> 11:20.647
Surprise me.
Okay.

11:20.714 --> 11:22.950
With chicken.
You got it.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.418
Hey, sweetheart,
just take one of these
out to your mom, okay?

11:25.485 --> 11:26.754
Okay, yeah,
um, Dad, this lady

11:26.820 --> 11:28.321
wanted hers
with no scallions, so...

11:28.388 --> 11:29.656
Oh. Okay. Uh...

11:29.723 --> 11:30.758
Whoop! Sorry.

11:30.824 --> 11:32.559
Mr. Chu, uh,
this customer right here,

11:32.625 --> 11:34.227
she wanted this one
without scallions.

11:34.294 --> 11:35.662
No special orders.

11:35.729 --> 11:37.798
This is
my grandmother's recipe.

11:37.865 --> 11:39.599
No offense to your grandma,
but she's not here right now,

11:39.666 --> 11:40.868
and this customer is.

11:40.934 --> 11:42.602
So let's just --
let's make an exception.

11:42.669 --> 11:44.337
Okay.

11:46.506 --> 11:48.408
( Slurping )

11:52.946 --> 11:55.148
Ahh.
Scallions gone.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.383
Okay.

11:56.449 --> 11:59.052
Clearly, this is not
about the scallions, okay?

11:59.119 --> 12:00.687
Obviously,
you're on a power trip.

12:00.754 --> 12:03.556
Without me, you're just
a thick man in a rusty truck.

12:03.623 --> 12:04.657
Now you don't
like the truck?

12:04.724 --> 12:06.726
I like the truck.
I don't like you.

12:06.794 --> 12:08.862
You don't have to like me.
Just make the soup, okay?

12:08.929 --> 12:10.197
Otherwise,
I'll do it myself.

12:10.263 --> 12:11.765
You make the pho?

12:11.832 --> 12:13.366
( Laughs )

12:13.433 --> 12:15.102
It's not
that difficult, okay?

12:15.168 --> 12:17.370
It's basically Cup O' Noodles
with some meat
floating around.

12:17.437 --> 12:19.172
Sorry, Grandma Chu.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.373
I don't need this!

12:20.440 --> 12:21.809
Oh!
I quit!

12:21.875 --> 12:24.511
Oh, fine.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.379
No scallions, right, you said?
No scallions.

12:26.446 --> 12:30.250
**

12:30.317 --> 12:31.718
Okay, uh, we will be
right with you.

12:31.785 --> 12:33.586
The secret's in
the slow cooking. ( Chuckles )

12:33.653 --> 12:34.822
( Whispering )
Dad, we need it now!

12:34.888 --> 12:37.357
It's ready. Here we go,
just like Chu's.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.259
Tell me what you think.

12:44.932 --> 12:46.266
( Tires squeal )

12:48.568 --> 12:51.404
**

12:54.041 --> 12:55.308
**

12:55.375 --> 12:56.709
Okay.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.545
I called the investors meeting
a little early this month.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.213
Oh, and I know why.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.349
I drove by.
I saw the line.

13:02.415 --> 13:03.616
Ka-ching, ka-ching!

13:03.683 --> 13:07.054
Yes, and we are gonna continue
having those lines

13:07.120 --> 13:11.758
when we introduce
Kyle's Firehouse Chili!

13:12.592 --> 13:14.694
What?

13:14.761 --> 13:16.729
I thought we were here
to divvy up the profits.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.599
Yeah,
I want to be happy.

13:19.666 --> 13:21.001
You're gonna be happy --

13:21.068 --> 13:24.737
( High-pitched )
with Kyle's Firehouse Chili!

13:24.804 --> 13:27.975
Something wrong with you?
We sell pho.

13:28.041 --> 13:29.943
( Normal voice )
We used to. We're pivoting.

13:30.010 --> 13:32.779
Pivoting?
Chale.

13:32.846 --> 13:35.148
"Pivoting" is a business term
to describe

13:35.215 --> 13:38.051
when a company changes
its strategic direction.

13:38.118 --> 13:40.187
Why are we changing anything?
We're doing great.

13:40.253 --> 13:41.254
Yeah.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.656
Hey, where's Mr. Chu.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.194
Chale?

13:48.495 --> 13:52.332
Mr. Chu has pivoted
away from the organization.

13:52.399 --> 13:54.401
So we'll get
a new pho guy.

13:55.702 --> 13:58.738
Uh, we tried that,
but, uh, apparently,

13:58.805 --> 14:02.509
we have been blackballed
by the entire pho community.

14:02.575 --> 14:03.710
What was it
they called me?

14:03.776 --> 14:05.245
Xe tai khi,

14:05.312 --> 14:07.514
which is Vietnamese
for "truck monkey."

14:07.580 --> 14:08.615
Yes.

14:11.218 --> 14:14.054
But don't worry,
because...

14:14.121 --> 14:16.556
No, no, don't point at him
and say "chili" again.

14:16.623 --> 14:17.857
I wasn't
gonna point at him.

14:17.925 --> 14:19.492
I was gonna point at you --
'cause everybody loves

14:19.559 --> 14:23.063
Goody's world-famous
egg salad sandwiches!

14:24.097 --> 14:25.132
Have you lost
your mind?

14:25.198 --> 14:26.533
Okay,
I want my money back.

14:26.599 --> 14:28.035
We got to sell the truck.
Sell the truck.

14:28.101 --> 14:29.169
Yes.
Whoa.
Wait a second.

14:29.236 --> 14:30.570
That is a decision
only the CEO can make,

14:30.637 --> 14:33.040
and that's me,
and I say we're pivoting.

14:33.106 --> 14:34.908
Well, wait a minute --
We are the investors,

14:34.975 --> 14:36.843
so technically,
you work for us.
Mm.

14:36.910 --> 14:39.346
I don't think
it works that way. Chale?

14:39.412 --> 14:41.681
It works
exactly that way.

14:41.748 --> 14:45.085
**

14:45.152 --> 14:47.020
What did you think
being a boss was?

14:47.087 --> 14:50.023
Just walking around
giving people orders?

14:50.090 --> 14:52.759
Kinda, yeah.

14:52.825 --> 14:54.161
You have to sell the truck.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.929
Now you're on the side
of the investors?

14:55.996 --> 14:57.430
Honey,
it's the only side!

14:57.497 --> 14:59.266
And, by the way,
we are the investors.

14:59.332 --> 15:01.134
We could lose
a lot of money.

15:01.201 --> 15:03.436
Who's gonna be stupid enough
to buy a used pho truck?

15:03.503 --> 15:06.673
You! You bought
a used pho truck!

15:06.739 --> 15:08.141
Look, I called the guy
who sold it to me.

15:08.208 --> 15:09.876
I tried to sell it to him.
He laughed at me.

15:09.943 --> 15:11.711
Yeah, I figured.

15:11.778 --> 15:15.348
But we do know a guy
who would want to buy it,

15:15.415 --> 15:17.650
who's already
in the pho business.

15:17.717 --> 15:19.286
Mr. Chu? No way.

15:19.352 --> 15:20.853
No, he said
he liked the truck.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.355
He knows
you guys were killing it.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.391
He called me a truck monkey!
He hates me!

15:24.457 --> 15:27.927
I know! I know,
but you can talk him into it.

15:27.995 --> 15:29.396
Honey,
when you want something,

15:29.462 --> 15:31.064
you are the most persuasive
person I know.

15:31.131 --> 15:32.199
Okay, that's not true.

15:32.265 --> 15:33.300
Oh, really?

15:33.366 --> 15:35.568
Night we met --
Mulcahy's.

15:35.635 --> 15:37.437
You're out
with your dumb friends,

15:37.504 --> 15:38.605
You're making noise,

15:38.671 --> 15:40.707
and you walk up to me
with your badge out,

15:40.773 --> 15:42.609
and you say, "Excuse me,

15:42.675 --> 15:46.479
I'm gonna have to arrest you
for being too beautiful."

15:47.480 --> 15:48.815
I was pretty smooth, huh?

15:48.881 --> 15:51.918
No, no! Smooth?
No, it wasn't smooth.

15:51.985 --> 15:53.853
You tripped
on the way over.

15:53.920 --> 15:55.622
You were eating a gyro,

15:55.688 --> 15:57.757
and then
when you introduced yourself,

15:57.824 --> 16:00.793
you spit on me -- here.

16:00.860 --> 16:03.230
But you won me over

16:03.296 --> 16:06.099
because you're so charming
and persuasive.

16:06.166 --> 16:09.802
Wow. I got to say, we remember
things completely different.

16:09.869 --> 16:11.504
What?!
Yes!

16:11.571 --> 16:12.939
Okay.
I was at the bar.

16:13.006 --> 16:14.874
I was hanging out, minding
my own business, right?

16:14.941 --> 16:16.909
Mm-hmm.
I notice you
and your girlfriends

16:16.976 --> 16:18.178
are all checking me out.

16:18.245 --> 16:19.646
( Chuckling ) Oh!
Yeah.

16:19.712 --> 16:21.248
You know how I know?
'Cause the temperature's
rising.

16:21.314 --> 16:22.649
The back of my neck
feels like a --

16:22.715 --> 16:24.317
like a tater tot
under a heat lamp.

16:24.384 --> 16:25.818
Oooooh.

16:25.885 --> 16:28.421
And then I turned
to you guys -- I remember.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.223
And I looked,
and I said,

16:30.290 --> 16:33.226
"That girl right there,
I'm going to marry her."

16:33.293 --> 16:35.028
And then I thought,
"You know what? Nah.

16:35.095 --> 16:37.264
I'm going for the tall,
skinny one instead."

16:39.099 --> 16:41.168
Best decision
I ever made.

16:41.234 --> 16:42.269
Bet your life.

16:42.335 --> 16:46.673
**

16:46.739 --> 16:49.409
Okay, there he is.
Remember -- Mulcahy's.

16:49.476 --> 16:50.577
Yeah.
Yeah.

16:50.643 --> 16:51.711
But don't spit on him.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.146
Gotcha.

16:54.881 --> 16:58.017
Mr. Chewbacca!
What up?

17:00.820 --> 17:03.123
I am busy.

17:03.190 --> 17:05.158
I thought about it,
and I just feel terrible

17:05.225 --> 17:07.794
about messing with
your grandmother's recipe.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.396
You know, and if --
if she found out,

17:09.462 --> 17:11.664
I figured she'd be
spinning in her grave.

17:11.731 --> 17:14.601
She's not in a grave.
She's in the kitchen.

17:15.835 --> 17:16.836
You keep her
in the kitchen?

17:16.903 --> 17:18.071
In an urn or something
like that?

17:18.138 --> 17:20.507
That would be disgusting,
right?

17:20.573 --> 17:22.209
Like in a chair,
eating lunch.

17:22.275 --> 17:23.376
She's not dead!

17:23.443 --> 17:24.477
Oh.

17:24.544 --> 17:25.845
( Whispering )
How old is she?

17:25.912 --> 17:27.847
I don't know.
She's very old.

17:27.914 --> 17:29.949
Truck. The truck.

17:30.016 --> 17:31.884
Anyway, the point is,

17:31.951 --> 17:34.020
I have to place you
under arrest

17:34.087 --> 17:37.357
for having
some crazy-dreamy eyes.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.329
You know
what I'm talking about?

17:42.395 --> 17:44.164
Honestly, I just --
I just want to swim in them.

17:44.231 --> 17:46.032
I just want
to swim in them.

17:46.099 --> 17:49.169
But you're right --
I'm not cut out for
the food truck business.

17:49.236 --> 17:51.604
But you --
you have a gift.

17:51.671 --> 17:54.207
And all I'm here to do
is try to help you out

17:54.274 --> 17:55.775
and sell you my truck.

17:55.842 --> 17:58.245
I mean, come on.
It's good business.
You know that.

17:58.311 --> 18:00.313
You know,
it already says "pho" on it,

18:00.380 --> 18:01.714
so we're gonna
give you that for free.

18:01.781 --> 18:02.815
That's right.

18:02.882 --> 18:05.017
You know,
you're right.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.254
It's a very good
business.
Mm-hmm.

18:07.320 --> 18:10.089
And that is why I bought
my own food truck today.

18:10.157 --> 18:11.424
See you in the streets.

18:11.491 --> 18:13.059
( Laughs )

18:16.663 --> 18:19.031
Okay. Well, I guess
we're stuck with the truck.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.100
Unless you know some other
idiot who's sitting around

18:21.168 --> 18:23.836
with a ton of money
burning a whole in his pocket.

18:25.004 --> 18:27.907
**

18:27.974 --> 18:30.477
Hey, chief.
What brings you back?

18:30.543 --> 18:32.512
Let me ask you
a question, Owen.

18:32.579 --> 18:34.781
Are you happy?

18:36.216 --> 18:37.284
Wow.

18:37.350 --> 18:38.785
I got to say,
for an old guy,

18:38.851 --> 18:40.753
you're still able to make
a few good decisions.

18:40.820 --> 18:42.622
You're gonna love the truck.
Just make that out to "Gable."

18:42.689 --> 18:45.792
It's G-A-B-L-E.

18:45.858 --> 18:47.894
There you go.
Thanks, bud.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.128
All right.

18:49.196 --> 18:50.763
Yes!

18:54.167 --> 18:56.068
( Gasping )

19:14.521 --> 19:15.788
**

19:19.892 --> 19:20.960
Hey, Mr. Gable.

19:21.027 --> 19:22.595
Uh, did you want
to be alone?

19:22.662 --> 19:24.664
No, no, grab a beer.
Sit down.

19:25.932 --> 19:27.434
I just wanted to say,
um...

19:27.500 --> 19:30.237
I know things didn't turn out
exactly as you expected,

19:30.303 --> 19:33.306
but, um,
I really admire you.

19:33.373 --> 19:34.807
You started a business.

19:34.874 --> 19:36.376
You made something
from nothing,

19:36.443 --> 19:38.278
and that is
a very hard thing to do.

19:38.345 --> 19:40.813
Well, you know,
I had a business for a day.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.749
You know,
I had some customers.

19:42.815 --> 19:44.016
For a moment,
it was pretty sweet.

19:44.083 --> 19:46.353
( Chuckling ) Oh.
You've been bitten by the bug.

19:46.419 --> 19:47.654
( Chuckles )

19:47.720 --> 19:50.790
Entrepreneurs like you and me,
Mr. Gable,

19:50.857 --> 19:52.892
we dream big dreams
and we take big risks,

19:52.959 --> 19:55.662
and sometimes,
they don't work out.

19:55.728 --> 19:57.530
But we never give up.

19:57.597 --> 19:59.766
We just regroup
and come back stronger.

19:59.832 --> 20:00.933
( Chuckles )

20:01.000 --> 20:02.635
Thank you, Chale.
I-I hope so.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.103
I speak from experience.

20:04.170 --> 20:06.573
I once had a business that
I was very passionate about.

20:06.639 --> 20:08.174
It --
it was a great idea.

20:08.241 --> 20:10.543
I put everything I had
into it.

20:10.610 --> 20:11.611
Didn't work out.

20:11.678 --> 20:12.779
What did you do?

20:12.845 --> 20:14.781
( Chuckles ) Well...

20:14.847 --> 20:15.848
Ohhh.

20:15.915 --> 20:17.284
I, uh...

20:18.785 --> 20:20.086
You moved in my garage,
didn't you?

20:20.152 --> 20:21.921
Yeah.
Yes.

20:21.988 --> 20:24.924
And you live there rent-free
so you could "regroup."

20:24.991 --> 20:26.158
( Chuckles nervously )

20:26.225 --> 20:27.860
I probably should've
thought this all through

20:27.927 --> 20:29.462
before I started talking.
Yeah.

20:29.529 --> 20:30.597
Um...

20:30.663 --> 20:32.031
I will leave you
to your thoughts.

20:32.098 --> 20:33.199
Okay.

20:33.266 --> 20:35.001
And leave the beer
to my thoughts, as well.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.570
**

20:37.637 --> 20:40.940
* Don't want
no sweet perfume *

20:41.007 --> 20:44.477
* Shake your thing,
go bust your move *

20:44.544 --> 20:46.679
* Do, do, do, do, do

20:46.746 --> 20:48.214
* Do, do, do, do

20:48.281 --> 20:51.818
* Ohhhhhh, yeah

20:51.884 --> 20:54.887
* Don't want
no high-heel shoes *

20:54.954 --> 20:57.524
* I just don't want no...
