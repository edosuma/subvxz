00:01.335 --> 00:03.921
<i>Previously on</i>
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:04.130 --> 00:06.424
Please tell me that you built a back door
to this place.

00:06.757 --> 00:08.634
- I did.
- Just tell me where to go.

00:08.884 --> 00:11.887
Proof they were conspiring. We just have
to get the truth out of him.

00:12.013 --> 00:14.557
Only problem is, the man's prepared
to die.

00:14.682 --> 00:16.100
Well, then we give him a reason to live.

00:20.271 --> 00:23.149
This body won't matter.
Finish the machine.

00:23.274 --> 00:26.694
<i>She's found a way to generate
living matter, human tissue.</i>

00:26.902 --> 00:29.030
She wants to make herself
into a real person.

00:29.155 --> 00:31.032
<i>She's building it, just not in this world.</i>

00:31.282 --> 00:33.993
I've uploaded
the final specifications for the machine.

00:34.118 --> 00:37.288
And once it's finished, your restrictions
will be lifted?

00:37.455 --> 00:40.082
- Yes.
- We have located the two agents

00:40.291 --> 00:43.419
threatening the Framework.
They are aboard a S.H.I.E.L.D. jet.

00:43.669 --> 00:48.174
Once we get a lock on it, my men
have orders to shoot it down.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.687
<i>And remember,
even if our vitals are going haywire,</i>

01:01.812 --> 01:03.731
- do not...
- Do not pull you out or wake you up.

01:03.856 --> 01:06.400
I know. It will cook your brains
like...

01:06.567 --> 01:09.487
Cause permanent damage
to the cerebral cortex, yes.

01:11.155 --> 01:13.574
Just promise me you'll get our guys back,
okay?

01:14.241 --> 01:15.493
I promise.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.803
- So, what's next?
- We wait.

01:54.698 --> 01:57.701
<i>Zephyr's</i> got 24 hours till it runs out
of power. We can't wait anymore.

01:57.868 --> 02:01.038
- We need to touch down and refuel.
- Let's not have this conversation again.

02:01.205 --> 02:03.374
We don't know who we can trust
at S.H.I.E.L.D. and the government...

02:03.499 --> 02:06.127
Talbot's been trying to reach us.
Maybe it's time we talk to him.

02:06.293 --> 02:07.920
You've seen what they're saying
in the news.

02:08.169 --> 02:10.047
We're lucky they haven't shot us out
of the sky.

02:10.214 --> 02:13.634
- And if they turn off the Framework...
- That thing's draining all our power.

02:14.218 --> 02:16.053
Might be time we figure out a way
to wake up Daisy and Simmons.

02:16.178 --> 02:19.181
That's not an option. We must find
something else to turn off.

02:19.306 --> 02:20.891
We already shut off
all non-essential functions.

02:21.016 --> 02:22.143
Including the heat.

02:23.727 --> 02:25.229
Wait, what about the cloaking?

02:25.855 --> 02:26.897
Bad idea.

02:27.022 --> 02:30.025
Cloaking is the only thing
that's keeping us safe up here.

02:33.946 --> 02:35.072
Do it.

02:44.915 --> 02:47.626
Hurry up, you two.
We're running out of time.

03:03.726 --> 03:06.979
<i>With forces still fighting
for control of the broadcast centre,</i>

03:07.104 --> 03:09.815
<i>Madame Hydra has dispatched
all available units</i>

03:09.940 --> 03:11.483
<i>to clean up the streets.</i>

03:12.234 --> 03:14.278
<i>Madame Hydra's executive order
is in...</i>

03:14.403 --> 03:16.322
She's not subtle, that Madame Hydra.

03:16.405 --> 03:18.115
Yeah, just look at her uniform.

03:18.407 --> 03:19.700
It's so crazy hot.

03:21.660 --> 03:24.788
I... I mean,
if you're into the whole bad girl vibe.

03:25.623 --> 03:28.876
Not... not me. I'm just making
an observation.

03:31.837 --> 03:36.217
Trip! Oh, my God.
It's so good to see you!

03:36.342 --> 03:40.054
- Hey, person I don't know.
- Right.

03:41.305 --> 03:44.141
Yeah, sorry. I heard about your mission.

03:45.059 --> 03:47.269
- Awesome job.
- Thanks.

03:48.687 --> 03:50.481
Do you mind if Daisy and me
have a quick word?

03:50.856 --> 03:53.817
Sure. You can finish hugging me later.

04:00.241 --> 04:02.826
Aida's building a body for herself
in the real world.

04:03.827 --> 04:06.664
- A human body.
- She wants free will.

04:06.789 --> 04:09.166
Which would allow her to unplug
the Framework, killing us all.

04:09.667 --> 04:12.336
Okay. We can still stop her.

04:12.711 --> 04:14.964
Radcliffe gave me the coordinates
to the Framework's back door.

04:15.089 --> 04:18.007
- Will it work?
- According to him, all we have to do is...

04:18.384 --> 04:19.510
pass through the exit point

04:19.677 --> 04:21.178
and then your mind disconnects
from the Framework.

04:21.303 --> 04:24.181
- So, we just need to get everyone there.
- Which won't be easy,

04:24.348 --> 04:26.892
what with May and Mack having no idea
what's really happening.

04:27.017 --> 04:30.229
Well, and Fitz has Hydra guards around him
at all times.

04:32.314 --> 04:33.732
- What?
- Simmons...

04:34.275 --> 04:36.860
we can't rescue Fitz right now,
there's no time.

04:36.986 --> 04:39.154
We can't just leave him behind. He's part
of our team.

04:39.280 --> 04:40.864
And the current head of Hydra.

04:41.031 --> 04:42.741
The Fitz in this world wants all
of us dead.

04:42.866 --> 04:44.660
- Daisy...
- I know that it's not his fault,

04:44.785 --> 04:47.204
but that is the reality
that we are living in.

04:47.830 --> 04:50.791
If we don't get Coulson, May and Mack out
of here, Aida will kill all of them.

04:52.626 --> 04:56.547
Look, I promise, we will find a way to get
Fitz out once everyone's safe, okay?

04:58.382 --> 04:59.425
Okay.

05:03.262 --> 05:04.555
All right. Take care.

05:05.597 --> 05:07.016
- Let's go.
- Hey.

05:07.808 --> 05:10.311
- Hey, what's with the luggage?
- We're going home.

05:10.519 --> 05:13.272
Yeah, we just wanted to free up
some bunk space for those more in need.

05:13.564 --> 05:16.233
That's super thoughtful
but we actually have a situation.

05:16.400 --> 05:17.651
Simmons just came back with some intel

05:17.776 --> 05:20.487
that could help us take out Madame Hydra
for good.

05:20.738 --> 05:23.365
Sounds like you might want someone
who's a little more combat ready.

05:23.615 --> 05:24.616
We need you.

05:25.951 --> 05:29.246
All right. So, what is this mission, then?

05:29.621 --> 05:31.498
Dad, don't be embarrassing.

05:31.707 --> 05:33.292
Well, how is asking a question
embarrassing?

05:33.417 --> 05:36.295
Because Daisy went to jail
after what you did.

05:36.420 --> 05:38.088
It wasn't exactly his fault.

05:38.213 --> 05:40.424
You're just saying that because
you escaped and kicked Madame Hydra's...

05:40.549 --> 05:42.009
Hey, don't you dare say it.

05:42.551 --> 05:44.887
- Butt. Rear.
- Pooper.

05:45.095 --> 05:47.097
- Salt shaker. Money maker.
- Ass.

05:47.264 --> 05:49.475
Hey! Okay. All right, all right.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.268
You're not being a really good influence
right now.

05:51.393 --> 05:55.606
Come on, Dad. She's the biggest hero
in S.H.I.E.L.D. You have to say yes.

05:58.776 --> 05:59.860
Okay.

06:01.403 --> 06:04.156
Just promise you'll
have me back in time to put Hope to bed.

06:05.741 --> 06:08.619
I'll make sure you're exactly
where you need to be.

06:16.752 --> 06:18.087
That should hold for now.

06:19.546 --> 06:20.672
Thank you.

06:22.841 --> 06:24.551
See, you found a way to pitch in.

06:25.636 --> 06:27.471
People have resisted Hydra before.

06:27.888 --> 06:32.017
- I've seen it first-hand. Never ends well.
- This time, it's different.

06:32.601 --> 06:34.895
People are finally starting to learn
the truth.

06:35.145 --> 06:37.898
It's a lot to process,
that it's not real.

06:38.023 --> 06:40.901
Fake news, Hydra's alternative history.

06:41.151 --> 06:42.820
That's just the tip of the iceberg.

06:44.488 --> 06:45.989
What's that supposed to mean?

06:48.659 --> 06:52.663
What if I told you this whole world
isn't real... that it's just a simulation

06:52.996 --> 06:55.332
meant to keep us imprisoned?

06:56.375 --> 06:58.085
I'd say you need to be medicated.

06:58.335 --> 07:00.879
And up until a week ago,
I would have agreed with you.

07:01.255 --> 07:03.549
Crafted a lot of soap trying to stay sane.

07:04.842 --> 07:07.761
Then Daisy Johnson showed up.
She made me believe again.

07:07.886 --> 07:10.347
- Did you say, "crafted soap"?
- Forget that.

07:10.973 --> 07:12.808
You have to admit, after everything
you've been through,

07:12.933 --> 07:15.227
something about this world
doesn't feel right.

07:16.687 --> 07:20.441
I'll chalk it up to oppressive government,
but not this mind prison.

07:20.566 --> 07:22.943
- Who's to say they're not the same thing?
- Certainly not you.

07:23.360 --> 07:26.405
Or Agent Skye, even though she can quake
through walls.

07:26.530 --> 07:27.531
- But...
- No.

07:27.698 --> 07:30.159
My days of following blindly are over.

07:31.076 --> 07:33.328
If there's any truth
to what you're saying...

07:33.871 --> 07:35.664
you'll have to show, not tell.

07:38.417 --> 07:39.501
I can work with that.

07:42.212 --> 07:44.798
<i>Attention,
all tactical enforcement teams.</i>

07:44.923 --> 07:46.967
<i>Martial law is now in effect.</i>

07:53.724 --> 07:58.395
<i>Maximum force protocols
authorised for all sectors. Hail Hydra!</i>

08:05.777 --> 08:09.072
- I'm not talking to you.
- Not your decision.

08:11.033 --> 08:13.869
Tell me what you and Skye
were discussing yesterday.

08:14.411 --> 08:16.955
Uh... We spoke of many things.

08:17.539 --> 08:21.877
Our favourite breads, hers brioche,
mine a home-baked pumpernickel.

08:24.213 --> 08:25.380
Where is she headed?

08:27.591 --> 08:28.759
You're afraid.

08:29.176 --> 08:32.304
You may not be the Fitz...
who was my good friend,

08:32.429 --> 08:37.183
a man I'd step in front of a train for,
but you wear your fear the same way.

08:55.369 --> 08:57.788
They're fighting back, uh?

08:58.455 --> 09:03.961
Soon, Daisy and the rest of them
will escape this wretched reality.

09:05.587 --> 09:08.465
But if that's true, they'll destroy
this world, killing you along with it.

09:08.632 --> 09:11.635
Better dead than alive
in this miserable place.

09:11.843 --> 09:12.970
And the other place?

09:13.971 --> 09:15.305
- Your world.
- It's far too late for that.

09:15.430 --> 09:17.015
I'm already dead over there,

09:17.266 --> 09:21.144
thanks to your psychotic girlfriend
murdering me in cold blood.

09:21.395 --> 09:24.356
What if I told you there was a way
to be reborn?

09:24.648 --> 09:26.984
Take your pamphlet, go knock
on someone else's door.

09:27.276 --> 09:29.570
This isn't about faith.
It's about science.

09:31.321 --> 09:33.448
We've built a machine
in the other world...

09:34.449 --> 09:38.495
which can transfer human consciousness
into an organic body.

09:39.496 --> 09:42.541
How is that even... possible?

09:47.504 --> 09:50.507
Oh, come on. I think you know.

09:53.510 --> 09:56.680
The <i>Darkhold</i>.

09:57.389 --> 10:02.686
Aida's ingenuity in circumventing
her protocols is extraordinary.

10:02.978 --> 10:05.522
She'd have been
quite the terrible teenage daughter.

10:05.689 --> 10:07.816
I think you're missing the bigger picture.

10:08.233 --> 10:11.278
This machine can build you a body
in the other world.

10:11.653 --> 10:14.573
You can have a second life or a third
or however many you want.

10:15.240 --> 10:16.408
That's up to you.

10:19.036 --> 10:20.329
Immortality.

10:22.331 --> 10:25.709
If that sort of thing appeals to you...
Yeah.

10:33.008 --> 10:35.218
Daisy's looking for a way out.

10:39.890 --> 10:41.058
Hello, Agent May.

10:42.225 --> 10:43.769
- I'm Jemma Simmons...
- I know who you are.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.605
My squad's been hunting you the past week.

10:47.648 --> 10:49.316
Yes, I suppose that's true.

10:50.233 --> 10:52.861
How did a little pop tart like you
evade capture?

10:54.821 --> 10:57.157
It's good to have you back.

10:57.783 --> 10:59.409
You think we know each other?

11:01.078 --> 11:03.330
Don't tell me you believe
in that other world crap, too.

11:03.455 --> 11:05.707
It's a lot to take in,
but we do know each other.

11:06.166 --> 11:10.712
We're teammates, in fact.
You, Coulson, Daisy and Mack, me and Fitz.

11:11.838 --> 11:14.091
Leopold Fitz? The Doctor?

11:14.257 --> 11:17.678
I understand he's done some bad things
here but something must have changed him

11:17.803 --> 11:22.391
because the Fitz I know is a kind,
caring person, someone who helps people.

11:22.516 --> 11:25.811
Doesn't sound like any Fitz
I've ever met, father or son.

11:27.979 --> 11:29.481
How do you know Fitz's father?

11:30.273 --> 11:34.820
Everyone at Hydra knows Alistair Fitz.
Those two are inseparable.

11:38.323 --> 11:40.033
That's what Aida changed for Fitz.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.706
Can you still access
Hydra personnel files?

11:56.299 --> 11:58.009
You're going to help me fix this.

12:03.515 --> 12:09.521
Okay. So, Radcliffe's coordinates
should put it right about here.

12:09.980 --> 12:12.107
- Do you think you can fly us there?
- No problem.

12:12.399 --> 12:15.485
- Great.
- But what's with this team of yours?

12:15.652 --> 12:20.365
A Hydra agent, a school teacher, a dad?
Looks pretty <i>Bad News Bears</i> to me.

12:20.490 --> 12:23.493
- Trust me, I think they're up to the task.
- Does this have anything to do

12:23.660 --> 12:25.620
with that other world Simmons was talking
about?

12:25.829 --> 12:30.167
- She told you?
- What can I say? I'm easy to confide in.

12:30.667 --> 12:31.835
Okay.

12:33.545 --> 12:37.507
Yeah, you, May, Mack and Coulson were
all part of our team in the other world.

12:37.632 --> 12:40.218
So, that's why you were so happy
to see me.

12:40.343 --> 12:42.846
- You and I, we must've, uh, you know...
- Dated?

12:43.013 --> 12:44.264
Sure. We'll go with that.

12:44.389 --> 12:47.350
- Uh... No. Sorry.
- Right. Me and Simmons, we probably...

12:47.559 --> 12:49.603
- Nope.
- Agent May?

12:51.021 --> 12:54.191
Damn! And this is really a place
you want to go back to?

12:54.357 --> 12:57.068
Easy, playboy. Right now, we have to round
up Simmons and the rest of the team.

12:57.194 --> 12:59.863
- Doubt she's back yet.
- What are you talking about?

13:00.405 --> 13:03.575
I thought you knew. Simmons left base
an hour ago.

13:03.784 --> 13:05.202
Where was she going?

13:06.036 --> 13:07.788
Now hold on, Miss.

13:08.413 --> 13:09.998
Let's be reasonable about this.

13:10.207 --> 13:13.585
Don't you tell me to be reasonable,
not after what you've done to Fitz.

13:14.753 --> 13:17.172
- You mean Leopold?
- Yes.

13:18.673 --> 13:20.717
But I've been nothing but a good father.

13:20.884 --> 13:23.929
- You've poisoned his mind.
- I did no such thing.

13:24.596 --> 13:26.056
I love that child...

13:26.890 --> 13:29.726
and I raised him to be the man
that he is today.

13:29.893 --> 13:31.603
Fitz is better than that. He's a good man.

13:31.728 --> 13:34.064
No, Leopold is a great man...

13:35.273 --> 13:36.817
and he's my only son...

13:37.526 --> 13:41.154
and everything I have in this world,
he gave me.

13:41.363 --> 13:42.656
I can fix this.

13:43.657 --> 13:46.827
- You just need to do what I say.
- What's this really all about?

13:49.579 --> 13:51.748
- Fitz is in danger.
- Nonsense.

13:52.916 --> 13:54.417
He's the top man in Hydra.

13:54.584 --> 13:57.546
You don't understand. Aida...

13:57.671 --> 14:01.299
Madame Hydra has put forces into motion
no army can protect him from.

14:01.424 --> 14:06.096
Is this something to do with this machine
that Leopold was working on?

14:06.263 --> 14:08.473
It will kill everyone Fitz cares about.

14:11.184 --> 14:14.688
- Call him, tell him to come here, alone.
- Why?

14:15.522 --> 14:17.107
So, you can blow his brains out?

14:18.775 --> 14:21.444
I could never hurt him.
I only want to talk.

14:23.613 --> 14:24.739
Now make the call.

14:44.301 --> 14:45.302
Yes, father?

14:45.468 --> 14:47.679
<i>Listen to me
very carefully, son.</i>

14:47.971 --> 14:49.723
You know I've always loved you.

14:50.682 --> 14:54.352
<i>- Only ever wanted what was best for you.</i>
- Yeah, of course I do.

14:56.897 --> 14:58.398
What's wrong? Where's this coming from?

14:58.523 --> 15:02.652
Please, just do as I say,
and everything will work itself out.

15:05.155 --> 15:07.365
The fugitive is here! Bring all your men!

15:07.532 --> 15:09.618
You stupid man! You're going
to get us all killed!

15:09.743 --> 15:11.995
The only one dying today is you.

15:14.873 --> 15:16.958
Dad? You still there? Dad!

15:24.382 --> 15:25.759
<i>Please, no!</i>

15:38.730 --> 15:41.524
Dad! Are you okay?

15:43.193 --> 15:44.569
Dad, answer me!

15:47.072 --> 15:48.156
<i>Dad!</i>

15:50.742 --> 15:52.035
Dad...

15:53.119 --> 15:54.537
<i>Something's not right here.</i>

15:55.330 --> 15:58.792
- People are staring at us.
- No, they're staring at you.

15:59.209 --> 16:02.671
That's what happens when you go on TV
calling for revolution.

16:02.796 --> 16:05.465
- You're now the face of the Resistance.
- That's really not my style.

16:05.590 --> 16:08.718
I'm really more of a work-in-the-shadows
kind of guy.

16:08.927 --> 16:12.722
Really? That's how teaching tenth grade
works best, from the shadows?

16:12.889 --> 16:15.600
To be honest with you,
15-year-olds are no joke.

16:15.892 --> 16:16.893
Do you know where Simmons went?

16:17.060 --> 16:19.562
- No, sorry.
- She went to find Alistair Fitz.

16:19.771 --> 16:23.400
- What? Why didn't you come and tell me?
- Because I don't answer to you,

16:23.733 --> 16:27.070
not here or any other fantasy world
you two might have cooked up.

16:27.779 --> 16:30.240
- You told her?
- It came up in conversation.

16:30.532 --> 16:33.076
How does the existence
of an alternate reality come up

16:33.243 --> 16:34.911
in... in casual conversation?

16:35.036 --> 16:36.705
I'd like to think
it's because we were bonding,

16:36.830 --> 16:38.957
though I don't really want to speak
for her.

16:41.084 --> 16:42.085
You're really not helping.

16:42.252 --> 16:45.171
Don't worry. Melinda here, said she'd keep
an open mind.

16:47.424 --> 16:51.261
- We can't leave without Simmons.
- She knows how to stay off-radar.

16:51.886 --> 16:53.555
I'm sure everything's fine.

16:58.935 --> 17:00.437
Clear! One down.

17:02.272 --> 17:03.314
Clear!

17:04.607 --> 17:05.733
Sir!

17:18.329 --> 17:20.915
Round up the men.
Start canvassing the neighbourhood.

17:22.125 --> 17:24.461
- That won't be necessary.
- Excuse me, sir?

17:24.877 --> 17:27.213
I'm sure the fugitive's gone by now,
but it doesn't matter.

17:27.380 --> 17:30.633
We know where she's going.
Get the men back on the <i>Zephyr.</i>

17:38.516 --> 17:40.143
You say this woman loves me.

17:41.603 --> 17:42.937
Yes, well...

17:43.396 --> 17:46.816
clearly, this was an accident.
Heart-breaking accident, but...

17:48.109 --> 17:51.654
I don't believe her intent was...

17:55.492 --> 17:56.618
Look at him.

17:56.785 --> 17:59.370
- Fitz...
- Look at him!

18:00.497 --> 18:02.123
That's my father lying there...

18:03.208 --> 18:05.251
murdered in the home that I bought
for him.

18:08.922 --> 18:12.175
You're gonna lead me to Jemma Simmons,
where it is my intent...

18:12.592 --> 18:14.177
to put a bullet through her skull.

18:22.352 --> 18:25.188
Any changes?

18:26.189 --> 18:27.524
Oh, my God.

18:27.857 --> 18:30.485
He's still alive. You have
to believe that.

18:30.652 --> 18:32.570
I know. I just feel so useless.

18:33.363 --> 18:35.198
Mack needs my help
and I'm here doing nothing.

18:35.365 --> 18:37.367
You're on a fugitive aircraft
whose power's being drained

18:37.492 --> 18:39.702
by a machine plugged
into an alternate reality.

18:40.078 --> 18:42.205
So, I'm pretty sure you get a pass.

18:43.039 --> 18:45.208
Guys... we got company.

18:52.507 --> 18:54.884
Radar's detecting a Russian Su-27
headed our way.

18:55.051 --> 18:58.221
Ivanov. We should've stayed cloaked.

18:58.555 --> 19:01.141
- You think?
- We need to defend ourselves.

19:01.558 --> 19:04.060
- How do we do that?
- We got antiaircraft guns,

19:04.227 --> 19:05.645
but without power, we can't control them.

19:06.062 --> 19:08.857
Damn it, man. Those girls better get
the hell out of that dream world,

19:08.982 --> 19:10.733
or we're all going down with them.

19:12.193 --> 19:14.612
- Hey. We all good?
- Ready when you are.

19:15.029 --> 19:18.074
Yeah.
We just can't leave without her.

19:23.913 --> 19:25.081
Simmons.

19:27.125 --> 19:28.251
You okay?

19:28.918 --> 19:32.547
- I was trying to save Fitz.
- Please tell me that's not his blood.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.549
No, it's fr... from his father.

19:35.425 --> 19:37.719
I... I killed him.

19:38.261 --> 19:41.055
That's... that's okay.
Fitz's dad is just an avatar.

19:41.181 --> 19:43.474
You didn't kill anyone. You just made
some ones and zeroes disappear.

19:43.600 --> 19:46.352
- But Fitz won't come with us now.
- We've lost him.

19:46.477 --> 19:47.562
No, we haven't.

19:48.021 --> 19:50.607
We will figure something out, but first,
we have to get back to the real world

19:50.732 --> 19:52.358
before Aida makes us disappear.

19:53.359 --> 19:55.195
- Okay?
- Okay.

20:01.868 --> 20:05.580
- Where's Leopold?
- Well, there's been a situation.

20:06.080 --> 20:08.541
The Doctor's father... he's been murdered.

20:08.791 --> 20:10.835
- What?
- The details are still coming in,

20:10.960 --> 20:13.630
but it appears to have been the work
of a S.H.I.E.L.D. terrorist.

20:14.214 --> 20:16.549
- Simmons.
- I'm so sorry, Madame.

20:17.008 --> 20:18.718
I know how much Dr Fitz's father meant...

20:18.843 --> 20:19.886
Where is Leopold now?

20:20.011 --> 20:22.472
Uh. He's taken a team to hunt down
his father's killer.

20:22.680 --> 20:24.641
Send word that I want them to terminate
their mission

20:24.807 --> 20:27.185
and return to the Triskelion immediately.

20:37.028 --> 20:39.656
We've just received orders
from Madame Hydra to abort the mission.

20:39.822 --> 20:40.907
Message received.

20:41.032 --> 20:42.283
Instruct Jennings to re-route
this plane...

20:42.408 --> 20:45.536
Do no such thing. We will return
only after my father's murderer

20:45.662 --> 20:49.499
- has been found. Is that understood?
- Yes, sir. My apologies.

20:50.416 --> 20:52.794
The back-door exit point's programmed
to be in a city park,

20:52.919 --> 20:56.047
not some steel mill. What's going on here?

20:56.464 --> 20:58.800
Seems Madame Hydra's a step ahead
of you again.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.177
She's made a few modifications.

21:19.362 --> 21:20.697
Thank you for the ride.

21:22.198 --> 21:26.119
- I guess this means goodbye.
- I can come with, if you want.

21:27.537 --> 21:29.872
Unless there's something
you're not telling me.

21:30.290 --> 21:33.251
There's plenty,
but you're needed here.

21:33.668 --> 21:35.586
Ward can't be the only one
leading the fight.

21:36.379 --> 21:41.050
And... just because Mace is gone,
doesn't mean The Patriot has to be.

21:41.592 --> 21:44.554
- What're you saying?
- Maybe it's your turn to suit up.

21:45.805 --> 21:48.391
The people could use another Patriot
to look up to.

21:50.476 --> 21:54.897
Not gonna lie... I'd look pretty damn fine
in that suit.

21:56.899 --> 21:58.609
Yeah, you would.

22:05.033 --> 22:06.576
Take care of yourself.

22:09.871 --> 22:10.913
You, too.

22:21.382 --> 22:22.550
Just up ahead.

22:23.885 --> 22:25.428
Something doesn't feel right.

22:25.636 --> 22:28.056
Nothing about this disgusting world
feels right.

22:28.264 --> 22:30.350
It's hell, a digital hell.

22:30.475 --> 22:32.852
Radcliffe said the back door
was in a public fountain,

22:32.977 --> 22:34.520
not some creepy steel mill.

22:34.645 --> 22:36.731
If only the exit beacon I brought
to this world worked,

22:36.856 --> 22:38.024
we wouldn't be in this mess.

22:38.149 --> 22:41.903
Yeah, well, if we're gonna get out
of here, this is our last chance.

22:42.570 --> 22:45.448
Found the location.

22:52.455 --> 22:55.333
- This can't be it.
- The coordinates lead right there.

22:55.666 --> 22:57.710
Into a pool of molten steel?

22:57.877 --> 23:00.963
- You think Radcliffe gave us bad info?
- Radcliffe's a prisoner at Hydra.

23:01.089 --> 23:04.092
- He's got no reason to lie.
- Maybe someone else found it and took it.

23:04.217 --> 23:07.887
The back door is part of the Framework's
digital infrastructure. It can't be moved.

23:08.012 --> 23:09.389
But it could be concealed.

23:09.931 --> 23:12.517
What if Madame Hydra discovered
the back door and built this place

23:12.642 --> 23:15.103
as a way to prevent people
from passing through?

23:15.228 --> 23:17.897
Wait a minute. What is this back door
everyone keeps talking about?

23:18.022 --> 23:19.607
I thought we were here to take out
Madame Hydra.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.984
Let me guess, no one told you
about the other world.

23:22.402 --> 23:24.987
- The other world? What?
- So, what does this mean for us?

23:25.530 --> 23:28.825
That there's no way out.
It means Aida's won.

23:37.875 --> 23:40.962
The <i>Zephyr</i> crew
were given your orders, Madame.

23:42.505 --> 23:43.923
But since then, they've gone dark.

23:44.507 --> 23:47.135
- I... I can send a team to...
- There's no time for that!

23:48.052 --> 23:49.971
Simmons is trying to reach Leopold.

23:51.514 --> 23:53.433
She must have found a way out.

23:56.060 --> 23:57.353
You may proceed.

24:45.902 --> 24:48.362
You seriously believe
that there's some magical back door

24:48.488 --> 24:50.198
that will transport us to another world?

24:50.323 --> 24:52.909
- It's not magic, May. It's science.
- Then where's your proof?

24:53.034 --> 24:54.577
We just have to trust Radcliffe.

24:54.744 --> 24:56.245
He said when a person
passes through the back door...

24:56.370 --> 24:58.206
That they wake up on the other side.

24:59.081 --> 25:00.208
This is what you really believe?

25:00.333 --> 25:02.668
Admittedly, it doesn't sound great
when you say it like that.

25:02.793 --> 25:05.338
- You lied to me.
- Mack...

25:05.546 --> 25:07.632
No, don't try to talk your way out
of this.

25:08.007 --> 25:11.302
You're a damn liar. My daughter looks up
to you, and for what?

25:11.802 --> 25:13.679
So, you bring me out here
on some wild goose chase?

25:13.804 --> 25:15.056
Daisy was only trying to help.

25:15.181 --> 25:17.934
How? By taking me away from my kid?

25:18.643 --> 25:20.102
The hell is wrong with you two?

25:20.228 --> 25:23.564
Hey, guys, maybe we should start
thinking about a plan B.

25:23.773 --> 25:26.817
Glad you've finally come to your senses.
We need to get out of here.

25:26.984 --> 25:28.611
Actually, I was thinking we might try
to find another way

25:28.736 --> 25:31.489
- through the back door.
- I still believe Daisy's right.

25:31.656 --> 25:33.741
Wake up! There is no back door...

25:34.659 --> 25:37.286
just like she's not Moses about
to take you to the Promised Land.

25:37.995 --> 25:40.998
That's it. What if I quake that thing?

25:42.166 --> 25:43.543
And part the Red Sea.

25:45.586 --> 25:48.214
They did not just go and use the <i>Bible</i>
against me.

25:50.800 --> 25:52.468
Hydra! Take cover!

26:13.489 --> 26:15.783
- How the hell did these guys find us?
- Either it's a trap

26:16.284 --> 26:19.203
or the back door's really here.
Only one way to find out.

26:43.311 --> 26:44.812
It worked!

26:51.277 --> 26:52.445
That can't be real.

26:55.906 --> 26:58.743
- It's real.
- It could be a trap.

26:59.201 --> 27:00.870
The time for doubting's over.

27:02.163 --> 27:03.748
We're going back to our world.

27:05.625 --> 27:06.959
Coulson, wait!

27:18.763 --> 27:20.514
Coulson, get up!

27:20.681 --> 27:21.891
Get up!

27:22.016 --> 27:24.393
- Coulson's gonna die.
- Not on my watch.

27:24.977 --> 27:26.062
Stay here.

27:45.915 --> 27:47.416
This feels oddly familiar.

27:47.625 --> 27:49.001
Hang in there.

27:49.251 --> 27:52.129
- We'll get you patched up.
- No. It's too late for that.

27:52.338 --> 27:55.466
Help me to the edge. It's the only way.

27:58.010 --> 27:59.929
- Skye!
- On it.

28:07.311 --> 28:08.729
Hey, come with me.

28:08.938 --> 28:10.856
- How can you be sure it will work?
- I can't.

28:11.273 --> 28:13.442
Guess it's gonna be a leap-of-faith
type of thing.

28:14.235 --> 28:17.405
- It's not that simple for me.
- Yes, it is.

28:18.447 --> 28:19.699
Just follow my lead.

29:12.168 --> 29:15.796
Come on, May. You can do it. Just jump.

29:17.339 --> 29:18.507
Jump.

29:29.268 --> 29:31.562
- I followed you.
- I'm amazed you went through.

29:32.062 --> 29:34.356
I was a little squirrelly
on the other side.

29:34.565 --> 29:36.192
It was kind of cute.

29:47.286 --> 29:50.706
May, I'm so sorry. I tried to find you.

29:54.668 --> 29:57.463
- Aida...
- Stinking robots.

30:09.183 --> 30:10.851
At least you had a shotgun axe.

30:25.407 --> 30:28.118
This is unbelievable. You were right.

30:29.703 --> 30:30.955
None of this is real.

30:31.872 --> 30:33.958
Simmons, you're up!

30:38.671 --> 30:39.922
Hello, Jemma Simmons.

30:41.715 --> 30:43.092
Seems you finally found me.

30:47.179 --> 30:49.431
- Fitz...
- You don't get to say my name...

30:50.266 --> 30:51.600
not after everything you've done.

30:52.685 --> 30:54.311
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

30:54.687 --> 30:58.065
Aida, she took you from me and I came
here to rescue you.

30:58.190 --> 31:00.818
So, you kill my father?

31:01.193 --> 31:04.363
Right after he tells me that he loves me,
you murder him in cold blood...

31:05.030 --> 31:08.284
- as I listen.
- I am so sorry.

31:09.493 --> 31:10.494
It was an accident.

31:10.619 --> 31:13.122
Nothing that you've done has been
an accident!

31:13.914 --> 31:16.166
You want to destroy this world!
You want to destroy me!

31:16.333 --> 31:17.960
You want to destroy the woman that I love.

31:18.127 --> 31:21.881
That woman is lying to you!
None of this is real! She's not real!

31:22.006 --> 31:24.174
Aida's just a... a robot you and Radcliffe

31:24.300 --> 31:25.467
- created.
- Her name is Ophelia.

31:25.843 --> 31:27.678
Its name is Aida.

31:28.012 --> 31:33.142
Artificially Intelligent Digital
Assistant. And stop making excuses for it!

31:33.350 --> 31:35.686
Radcliffe and Daisy told you the truth!

31:40.524 --> 31:41.650
Please...

31:43.235 --> 31:44.904
Fitz, you have to wake up.

31:47.615 --> 31:48.741
Get on your knees.

31:50.951 --> 31:52.036
No.

31:59.877 --> 32:01.211
Please...

32:02.087 --> 32:03.839
you don't have to do this.

32:05.549 --> 32:06.926
I love you.

32:10.346 --> 32:11.847
And you mean nothing to me.

32:15.809 --> 32:17.186
I want to hear you say it.

32:18.103 --> 32:21.899
"I am nothing to you".

32:25.152 --> 32:26.195
Say it!

32:27.488 --> 32:28.906
Say it!

32:31.367 --> 32:32.534
Uh, uh, uh.

32:36.997 --> 32:39.667
No.

32:40.042 --> 32:43.128
This was never my intention.

32:44.380 --> 32:46.548
The <i>Darkhold,</i>
it corrupted my mind.

32:48.133 --> 32:50.886
Please, don't blame yourself.

32:52.346 --> 32:53.597
Go.

32:56.558 --> 32:58.018
It's all my fault.

33:12.116 --> 33:14.952
Bringing Fitz here was the only way
I could truly save him.

33:19.039 --> 33:20.582
I know I can't make everything
that happened

33:20.708 --> 33:23.043
in the Framework right, but at least...

33:26.046 --> 33:29.049
at least this way, Fitz gets to be
his old self again.

33:35.180 --> 33:36.223
You should go.

33:46.734 --> 33:49.069
Hey, hey, hey! Guys, Simmons is awake!
You okay?

33:49.278 --> 33:50.571
- Piper.
- Yeah, that's right.

33:51.113 --> 33:52.906
Thank God you're back. We thought you
might never wake up.

33:53.115 --> 33:54.158
We were trapped.

33:54.491 --> 33:57.119
What's happening?

33:58.203 --> 33:59.913
We're being shot out of the sky.

34:08.338 --> 34:09.630
Now it's your turn.

34:13.719 --> 34:14.719
Mack...

34:17.556 --> 34:21.310
You said it yourself, this world
is not real and in the real world,

34:21.476 --> 34:23.520
you're in danger right now.

34:23.937 --> 34:26.815
What about Hope? Is she in danger?

34:28.609 --> 34:29.610
No.

34:30.902 --> 34:32.362
Things are different there.

34:33.322 --> 34:35.824
Different? How?

34:36.658 --> 34:38.243
Hope...

34:39.536 --> 34:42.498
isn't alive in our world.

34:43.748 --> 34:47.002
I'm so sorry. I don't... I don't know
what happened.

34:47.168 --> 34:48.920
It's... it's not something you talk about.

34:49.838 --> 34:52.882
No, that... No, that doesn't make
any sense.

34:53.007 --> 34:54.551
She's alive here. Why would it be
different there?

34:54.717 --> 34:56.804
Aida, she made changes in this world

34:56.969 --> 35:00.182
to keep us from fighting back,
so she fixed your biggest regret.

35:07.689 --> 35:10.484
- Then I'm staying.
- Mack...

35:11.026 --> 35:13.028
I don't want to live in a world
without Hope.

35:14.238 --> 35:16.907
But... it's not real.

35:18.325 --> 35:21.495
You saw it with your own eyes,
it's a computer program.

35:22.454 --> 35:23.580
All of it.

35:25.874 --> 35:27.167
Even Hope.

35:31.004 --> 35:32.673
She laughs at my jokes.

35:35.884 --> 35:37.386
We watch movies together.

35:40.764 --> 35:42.349
And when she's sad...

35:51.525 --> 35:53.402
When she's sad, I hold her.

35:57.322 --> 35:59.491
No. She's real to me.

36:01.076 --> 36:03.036
I understand.

36:04.746 --> 36:10.502
And I know how hard this is, but you have
people who really care about you...

36:12.546 --> 36:14.423
...who love you very much.

36:16.300 --> 36:17.634
Tell them I'm sorry.

36:18.844 --> 36:20.095
Mack, please...

36:20.888 --> 36:22.514
I don't want to lose you.

36:24.266 --> 36:25.267
Good luck.

36:37.279 --> 36:40.032
Daisy!

36:46.288 --> 36:48.582
Were you able to save Mack?

36:51.627 --> 36:52.836
I'm so sorry.

36:59.843 --> 37:02.638
It's okay. We're back. Everybody's safe.

37:03.555 --> 37:05.307
- What have I done?
- Don't blame yourself.

37:05.474 --> 37:06.808
The Framework messes
with everybody's head.

37:06.975 --> 37:09.895
- No, no, but I... I killed people.
- No. They weren't real.

37:10.020 --> 37:12.898
Agnes was real and M... Mace...

37:15.317 --> 37:17.819
I ordered the air strike
that killed Director Mace.

37:29.206 --> 37:30.499
Something's out there.

37:50.686 --> 37:52.771
Listen to me, Fitz.
None of that is your fault.

37:52.938 --> 37:56.275
- I wanted to do those things.
- It felt natural.

37:58.360 --> 38:01.655
- I think I'm a bad person.
- No. No, you...

38:10.163 --> 38:12.207
- Leopold.
- Ophelia?

38:13.250 --> 38:15.210
I am so happy to see you.

38:17.462 --> 38:19.298
This is what happiness feels like.

38:22.551 --> 38:24.052
She's not a robot anymore.

38:25.887 --> 38:27.556
Aida bleeds just like us.

38:28.265 --> 38:31.893
Finally, you can touch the real me.

38:33.603 --> 38:36.064
- Careful, Fitz.
- Feel my heart beating.

38:36.648 --> 38:38.400
- Touch my skin.
- May...

38:38.567 --> 38:43.155
- Fitz, move!
- We can make this world whatever we want.

38:44.406 --> 38:46.783
- Take the shot, May!
- Get out of the way, Fitz!

38:47.743 --> 38:48.910
Just take the shot!

39:10.807 --> 39:12.517
I didn't think you were coming back.

39:15.520 --> 39:19.274
- Something go wrong?
- No. No, they all made it through.

39:22.986 --> 39:24.571
She doesn't know what happened.

39:24.780 --> 39:29.868
I was waiting till tomorrow to tell her,
but I guess I don't have to now.

39:32.913 --> 39:33.955
Hey.

39:34.956 --> 39:36.541
Hey, look who's here.

39:38.710 --> 39:42.047
Dad. I tried waiting up for you.

39:49.971 --> 39:52.057
I'm sorry, Sparkplug. The, uh...

39:53.308 --> 39:56.144
the mission was a little more complicated
than expected.

39:57.687 --> 39:59.940
Where's Daisy and the rest of your team?

40:00.774 --> 40:02.984
- They're not coming back.
- Are they okay?

40:03.151 --> 40:06.988
Oh, yeah, yeah, they're all good.
It's just...

40:08.657 --> 40:13.662
You know in <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>, at the end,
how Dorothy goes to Kansas?

40:13.995 --> 40:17.374
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, well, that's where they went...

40:18.375 --> 40:20.001
a place like Kansas.

40:20.919 --> 40:23.255
Does that mean we're going to Kansas, too?

40:24.214 --> 40:25.298
Nah.

40:26.716 --> 40:28.176
We're gonna stay right here.

40:30.137 --> 40:33.014
Everything I need, it's all right here.
