WEBVTT

00:00.960 --> 00:03.224
PREVIOUSLY ON "ALL AMERICAN"...

00:03.230 --> 00:04.493
ASHER: WHERE'D THAT
TRICK PLAY COME FROM?

00:04.500 --> 00:05.592
CRENSHAW'S PLAYBOOK.

00:05.600 --> 00:07.864
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO COME
UP WITH A WHOLE NEW PLAYBOOK

00:07.870 --> 00:09.360
SINCE SOMEONE GAVE
MALIBU OURS.

00:09.370 --> 00:10.303
AS SOON AS I TELL
MY DAD WHAT YOU DID,

00:10.310 --> 00:11.459
YOU'RE OFF THIS TEAM.

00:11.470 --> 00:12.835
YOU SERIOUS RIGHT NOW?

00:12.840 --> 00:13.910
LEILA: I DON'T WANT THIS
TO AFFECT OUR FRIENDSHIP.

00:13.910 --> 00:15.071
I DO.

00:15.080 --> 00:16.639
SO, YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE FRIENDS?

00:16.650 --> 00:18.175
NO, I WANT TO BE
MORE THAN FRIENDS.

00:18.180 --> 00:20.569
BILLY: THE SPORTS COMMITTEE
RECEIVED AN ANONYMOUS TIP.

00:20.580 --> 00:22.719
I'M AFRAID YOU ALL ARE GONNA
HAVE TO GET DRUG-TESTED TODAY.

00:22.720 --> 00:24.040
RIPLEY: YOU PUT YOUR
ALL INTO SOME GAME

00:24.050 --> 00:25.120
AND THEN FOR WHAT?

00:25.120 --> 00:26.656
I GUESS FOR ME,
THERE'S JUST

00:26.660 --> 00:28.116
MORE TO LIFE THAN
JUST FOOTBALL.

00:28.120 --> 00:30.020
WHAT HAPPENS IF
A PLAYER TESTS POSITIVE?

00:30.030 --> 00:31.589
OH, THEY GET SUSPENDED
FOR THE PLAYOFFS.

00:31.590 --> 00:33.627
I'M GONNA FAIL.

00:33.630 --> 00:34.859
I USED TO COACH
WITH YOUR DAD.

00:34.860 --> 00:36.021
I EVEN RECOMMENDED
HE TAKE OVER

00:36.030 --> 00:37.668
AT BEVERLY
WHEN I LEFT.

00:37.670 --> 00:39.365
AND BILLY BAKER,
THAT MAN,

00:39.370 --> 00:41.930
HE'LL DO ANYTHING
TO GET WHAT HE WANTS.

00:41.940 --> 00:43.863
TYRONE: I DON'T LIKE BEING
SUMMONED, SHAWN SCOTT.

00:43.870 --> 00:45.702
THIS HERE'S
EVERYTHING I SAVED.

00:45.710 --> 00:46.734
SO, WHY YOU
GIVING ME THIS?

00:46.740 --> 00:48.208
BECAUSE I WANT OUT.

00:48.210 --> 00:49.769
I WANT TO TAKE MY
LITTLE GIRL OUT OF HERE.

00:49.780 --> 00:51.077
HOPING THIS HERE
BUYS ME THAT.

00:51.080 --> 00:52.707
LOOKS LIKE
WE GOT A DEAL.

00:52.710 --> 00:54.314
JUST TOOK ME THROWING
SOME PAPER TYRONE'S WAY

00:54.320 --> 00:55.378
AND NOW WE ALL SQUARE.

00:55.380 --> 00:56.609
THIS HERE IS
FOR BONEZ.

00:56.620 --> 00:58.145
SHAWN: WAIT.

00:58.150 --> 00:59.754
SHAWN. SHAWN!

01:22.780 --> 01:23.770
BILLY: SPENCER JAMES.

01:23.780 --> 01:25.248
I NEED YOU TO COME
PLAY FOR ME.

01:25.250 --> 01:26.411
GRACE: HOW COULD YOU
NOT TELL ME, SPENCER?

01:26.420 --> 01:28.275
-MA.
-DON'T "MA" ME RIGHT NOW.

01:28.280 --> 01:31.682
TELL ME THAT
GOING TO BEVERLY

01:31.690 --> 01:34.159
ISN'T THE BEST THING
FOR YOU, BABY.

01:34.160 --> 01:35.787
SPENCER: I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN DO THIS.

01:35.790 --> 01:37.155
COOP: YOU CAN AND YOU WILL.

01:37.160 --> 01:38.980
I SAY FORGET THIS
PLACE AND BOUNCE.

01:38.990 --> 01:40.151
WHO WOULDN'T?

01:40.160 --> 01:41.753
MAN: HEY!

01:41.760 --> 01:43.159
HEADED IN
THE WRONG DIRECTION.

01:43.170 --> 01:45.264
RODEO DRIVE IS
THE OTHER WAY.

01:52.740 --> 01:54.708
YOUNG SHAWN: LOOK AT ME, SPENCE.

01:59.180 --> 02:01.376
I'M GOING WAY HIGHER
THAN YOU, SHAWN.

02:03.690 --> 02:05.385
MAN, YOU TRIPPIN'.

02:05.390 --> 02:07.188
COOP, WHO'S WINNING?

02:07.190 --> 02:08.384
YOUNG COOP: I AM.

02:08.389 --> 02:10.119
YOUNG SPENCER: COOP ALWAYS WINS.

02:22.800 --> 02:24.859
MAN: OH, OH, WHOA-OH-OH

02:24.870 --> 02:26.065
OH, OH

02:26.070 --> 02:27.469
MAN 2: GOT IT
IN MY SIGHTS...

02:27.480 --> 02:30.302
BILLY: COME ON,
LET'S GO, LET'S GO!...

02:32.750 --> 02:34.775
MAN: I CAN TASTE IT NOW...

02:34.780 --> 02:36.077
PLAYER: WIDE, 300.

02:36.080 --> 02:39.414
DIFFERENT PLAYER:
HERE! HERE! HERE!

02:39.420 --> 02:42.310
MAN: IT'S WHO WE ARE,
IT'S WHAT WE...

02:43.730 --> 02:45.858
BILLY: NO, NO, NO!

02:45.860 --> 02:47.828
SLOPPY. SLOPPY.

02:47.830 --> 02:49.423
IS THIS THE TEAM THAT JUST WON

02:49.430 --> 02:52.400
THE DIVISION CHAMPIONSHIP? HUH?

02:52.400 --> 02:56.860
PLAYER: YEAH, COACH.
BILLY: PLAY LIKE IT! PLEASE!

02:56.870 --> 02:59.908
GET IT TOGETHER.
COME HERE, 1.

02:59.910 --> 03:01.730
JORDAN: YEAH.

03:01.740 --> 03:03.777
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU OUT THERE?

03:03.780 --> 03:05.179
I'M JUST USED TO ASHER
RUNNING THAT ROUTE.

03:05.180 --> 03:07.274
I DON'T CARE WHO'S
RUNNING WHAT ROUTE.

03:07.280 --> 03:08.770
YOU THROW A LAZY
PASS LIKE THAT,

03:08.780 --> 03:09.941
THE D'S GONNA
SWALLOW IT RIGHT UP.

03:09.950 --> 03:11.088
YEAH.

03:11.090 --> 03:12.888
NOW, WHERE'S
YOUR FOCUS?

03:12.890 --> 03:15.188
WHERE DO YOU THINK
MY FOCUS IS?

03:15.190 --> 03:16.851
-LOOK, JORDAN--
-NO, NO, LOOK.

03:16.860 --> 03:18.089
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
AS SOON AS THOSE

03:18.090 --> 03:19.797
DRUG TEST RESULTS
COME IN, I'M DONE.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.758
LISTEN TO ME.
UNTIL WE HEAR ANYTHING,

03:22.760 --> 03:23.761
YOU ARE MY QB.

03:23.770 --> 03:24.896
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

03:24.900 --> 03:25.924
-YEAH.
-WHAT DID I SAY?

03:25.930 --> 03:27.432
-I'M YOUR QB.
-ALL RIGHT.

03:27.440 --> 03:28.862
NOW, JUST RUN THE DAMN OFFENSE.

03:28.870 --> 03:30.759
-YEAH. OK.
-ALL RIGHT.

03:30.770 --> 03:33.831
ALL RIGHT, Y'ALL.
HUDDLE UP.

03:38.950 --> 03:40.543
I UNDERSTAND IT'S BEEN
A TOUGH WEEK.

03:40.550 --> 03:41.540
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

03:41.550 --> 03:43.814
I DON'T CARE.

03:43.820 --> 03:45.788
IF YOU PLAY THE WAY
YOU HAVE BEEN PLAYING,

03:45.790 --> 03:48.157
WE ARE GONNA BE ONE AND DONE
IN PLAYOFFS.

03:48.160 --> 03:49.787
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

03:49.790 --> 03:51.087
PLAYERS: YES, SIR.
BILLY: DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

03:51.090 --> 03:52.558
PLAYERS: YES, SIR!

03:52.560 --> 03:54.096
NOW, I SAID AT
THE START OF THE SEASON,

03:54.100 --> 03:56.819
YOU WIN, YOU GET RECOGNIZED.

03:56.830 --> 03:58.821
WELL, WE WON.

03:58.830 --> 04:00.332
<i>"THE LA, TRIBUNE" HAS ANNOUNCED</i>

04:00.340 --> 04:02.934
THEIR REGULAR SEASON AWARDS,

04:02.940 --> 04:05.966

AS I TELL YOU

04:05.970 --> 04:08.132

DIVISION COACH OF THE YEAR.

04:08.140 --> 04:11.246
BILLY: THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT.

04:11.250 --> 04:13.139
FOR REAL, I COULD NOT HAVE WON

04:13.150 --> 04:16.939
WITHOUT EACH AND EVERY ONE
OF YOU PLAYERS GIVING YOUR ALL.

04:16.950 --> 04:20.317
AND THAT INCLUDES THE DIVISION
PLAYER OF THE YEAR,

04:20.320 --> 04:21.515
MR. SPENCER JAMES.

04:24.990 --> 04:28.028

OF ALL OF Y'ALL.

04:28.030 --> 04:29.862

04:37.110 --> 04:39.977
HEY. CONGRATULATIONS,

04:39.980 --> 04:41.971
BILLY: ALL RIGHT,
MAN, GET OUT OF HERE.

04:41.980 --> 04:43.971
HEY, I'M SORRY I MISSED
THAT PRACTICE, COACH.

04:43.980 --> 04:45.846
I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN
GOING THROUGH A LOT.

04:45.850 --> 04:49.275
TIME'S GONNA TAKE CARE
OF A LOT OF THAT, BUT, UH,

04:49.280 --> 04:50.543

05:01.400 --> 05:03.619
WHERE THEY WANT TO
GIVE US OUR AWARDS.

05:03.630 --> 05:05.166
I THINK IT COULD
BE GOOD FOR YOU.

05:05.170 --> 05:06.194
I GOTTA GIVE
A SPEECH?

05:06.200 --> 05:07.338
A SHORT ONE.

THANK FAMILY,

05:10.870 --> 05:12.907
-YOU?
-YEAH. ARE YOU GONNA THANK ME?

05:12.910 --> 05:15.038
I'll THINK ABOUT IT.

05:15.040 --> 05:16.906
I'M PROUD

05:16.910 --> 05:18.378
SPENCER: THANK YOU, COACH.
BILLY: ALL RIGHT.

05:18.380 --> 05:20.144
YOU SAVE YOUR "THANK YOU"

05:20.150 --> 05:21.311
SPENCER: RIGHT. BILLY: I
TOLD YOU THIS WOULD HAPPEN

05:21.320 --> 05:23.539
IF YOU CAME

05:23.550 --> 05:24.540
IF YOU KEEP PLAYING
LIKE THIS,

05:24.550 --> 05:26.086
YOU'LL BE
ALL AMERICAN.

05:26.090 --> 05:28.411
MAN: MAKING MOVES
LIKE A BOSS

05:28.420 --> 05:31.355

I'M TIRED, Y'ALL.

05:56.950 --> 05:58.679
WOMAN: THAT'S RIGHT.
PASTOR: THIS LIST

05:58.690 --> 06:02.615
JUST KEEPS GROWING.

06:02.620 --> 06:06.181
HOW MANY MORE NAMES
DO I NEED TO READ IN HERE?

06:08.100 --> 06:10.922
I'VE KNOWN
SHAWN SCOTT SINCE

06:10.930 --> 06:12.898
BEFORE HE COULD WALK.

06:14.240 --> 06:16.436
HE SHOULD BE SITTING RIGHT HERE,

06:16.440 --> 06:18.966
NEXT TO HIS BEAUTIFUL MOTHER.

06:20.480 --> 06:23.302
INSTEAD, WE'RE SAYING GOOD-BYE

06:23.310 --> 06:26.712
TO HIM ON TUESDAY.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.371
WE HAVE CHILDREN
LEAVING OUR NEIGHBORHOODS

06:29.380 --> 06:31.940
JUST TO STAY ALIVE.

06:33.390 --> 06:37.020
Y'ALL AIN'T TIRED?

06:37.030 --> 06:40.295
THIS ENDLESS CYCLE OF VIOLENCE.

06:44.730 --> 06:47.665
WHOSE NAME AM I GONNA
READ IN HERE NEXT?

06:50.010 --> 06:58.010
YOURS? YOURS?
HOW ABOUT YOURS?

06:58.150 --> 07:00.949
AM I GONNA READ
YOUR NAME IN HERE NEXT?

07:05.120 --> 07:06.952
PASTOR: SPENCER,
THANK YOU.

07:19.200 --> 07:21.692
HOW'S EVERYONE
DOING?

07:21.700 --> 07:24.465
COQP'S HURTING
REAL BAD.

07:24.470 --> 07:27.337
SHAWN'S MOM'S
A STRONG WOMAN.

07:27.340 --> 07:30.469
IT AIN'T FAIR, MAN. I CAN'T
IMAGINE BURYING TWO SONS.

07:30.480 --> 07:32.005
TWQO?

07:32.010 --> 07:34.115
YEAH. SHAWN'S
BROTHER DIED LAST YEAR.

07:37.450 --> 07:39.043
SO, HOW LONG
YOU BEEN OUT HERE?

07:39.050 --> 07:41.451
UH, ABOUT AN HOUR.

07:41.460 --> 07:44.623
I REALLY WANTED TO BE
HERE FOR YOU, WITH YOU,

07:44.630 --> 07:48.453
BUT, UM, WASN'T SURE
IF I SHOULD GO INSIDE.

07:48.460 --> 07:50.064
WHY?

07:50.070 --> 07:53.563
WELL, WE HAVEN'T
REALLY DEFINED THIS, UM...

07:53.570 --> 07:55.129
WHAT, RELATIONSHIP?

07:55.140 --> 07:57.234
SO, IT IS
A RELATIONSHIP.

07:57.240 --> 07:58.708
I JUST--
I WASN'T SURE.

07:58.710 --> 08:00.200
I MEAN, I WANTED IT
TO BE, OBVIOUSLY,

08:00.210 --> 08:01.507
BUT WE HAVEN'T
HAD THE OFFICIAL, LIKE,

08:01.510 --> 08:03.376
"HEY, ARE WE TOGETHER?"
TALK, SO I DON'T--

08:03.380 --> 08:04.472
YEAH, I KNOW.

08:12.050 --> 08:13.518
GOOD TALK.

08:15.190 --> 08:17.386
YOU DIDN'T TALK
THE WHOLE RIDE.

08:17.390 --> 08:19.484
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?

08:19.490 --> 08:20.753
YOU THINKING ABOUT
WHAT PASTOR WEEKS SAID?

08:20.760 --> 08:23.491
-NOPE.
-WELL, I AM.

08:23.500 --> 08:25.093
HE'S ALWAYS SAYING
THE SAME THING.

08:25.100 --> 08:26.261
WELL, MAYBE IF
KIDS STOPPED DYING,

08:26.270 --> 08:28.238
THEN HE'D CHANGE
HIS MATERIAL.

08:28.240 --> 08:30.163
I DON'T WANT HIM
READING YOUR NAME.

08:30.170 --> 08:31.399
-I'll BE ALL RIGHT.
-NO, NOT IF YOU KEEP TALKING

08:31.410 --> 08:32.501
ALL THAT REVENGE STUFF.

08:32.510 --> 08:33.409
WHAT AM 1 SUPPOSED
TO DO?

08:33.409 --> 08:34.501
I DON'T KNOW.

08:34.510 --> 08:36.068
I DON'T KNOW.
WALK AWAY?

08:36.080 --> 08:37.104
YOU THINK IF THIS
HAPPENED TO ME,

08:37.110 --> 08:38.077
SHAWN WOULD'VE
WALKED AWAY?

08:38.080 --> 08:39.342
NO! NO, HE WOULD
BE DOING

08:39.350 --> 08:40.442
EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE
DOING RIGHT NOW,

08:40.450 --> 08:41.611
AND THAT'S WHY
HIS NAME WAS

08:41.620 --> 08:43.076
READ IN CHURCH TODAY.

08:44.250 --> 08:46.617
REALLY?

08:51.090 --> 08:52.251
I'M STARVING.

08:52.260 --> 08:53.250
WHAT YOU
GONNA MAKE?

08:53.260 --> 08:54.728
SANDWICH.

08:54.730 --> 08:56.289
HEY, MAKE ME
ONE TO GO.

08:56.300 --> 08:58.428
BACK TO
BEVERLY HILLS?

08:58.430 --> 09:00.262
GOT A SCRIMMAGE
TOMORROW.

09:02.800 --> 09:03.801
WHEN WERE YOU
GONNA TELL ME

09:03.810 --> 09:05.562
YOUR LITTLE SECRET?

09:07.210 --> 09:09.702
LEILA? HEY,
I'M SORRY, MOM.

09:09.710 --> 09:13.271
WE AIN'T TOLD NOBODY
ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP YET.

09:13.280 --> 09:17.581
I LIKE LEILA.
SHE'S NICE.

09:17.590 --> 09:18.648
BUT I WAS TALKING
ABOUT YOUR

09:18.650 --> 09:21.119
PLAYER OF THE YEAR
AWARD.

09:22.560 --> 09:23.721
COOP TOLD ME
AT CHURCH.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.152
HEY, THAT AIN'T
NO BIG DEAL.

09:25.160 --> 09:26.628
THAT IS A BIG DEAL!

09:26.630 --> 09:28.257
THAT'S WHY YOU MOVED
TO BEVERLY,

09:28.260 --> 09:30.126
TO GET NOTICED.

09:30.130 --> 09:33.191
SPENCER.

09:33.200 --> 09:35.294
ALL OF YOUR DREAMS ARE
STARTING TO COME TRUE.

09:35.300 --> 09:36.802
IT JUST DON'T
FEEL RIGHT.

09:36.810 --> 09:37.834
CELEBRATING
RIGHT NOW.

09:37.840 --> 09:39.308
EVERYBODY HERE
IN PAIN?

09:39.310 --> 09:40.436
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
FEEL GUILTY ABOUT

09:40.440 --> 09:42.431
ACCOMPLISHING
SOMETHING GREAT.

09:42.440 --> 09:44.442
YOU EARNED THIS,
SPENCER.

09:44.450 --> 09:45.440
YOU CHOSE YOUR OWN PATH

09:45.450 --> 09:48.613
AND IT'S PAYING OFF.

09:48.620 --> 09:50.486
SHAWN SCOTT CHOSE
A DIFFERENT PATH.

09:50.490 --> 09:52.345
DID HE?

09:52.350 --> 09:54.318
HE MADE
HIS OWN CHOICES.

09:58.290 --> 10:00.600
YOUNG SPENCER: I'M GOING
WAY HIGHER, SHAWN.

10:03.200 --> 10:04.622
MAN, YOU TRIPPIN'.

10:04.630 --> 10:06.359
COOP, WHO'S WINNING?

10:06.370 --> 10:07.690
I AM.

10:07.700 --> 10:09.168
YOUNG SPENCER: COOP ALWAYS WINS.

10:09.170 --> 10:10.205
GET USED TO IT.

10:10.210 --> 10:10.938
SAYS WHO?

10:10.940 --> 10:12.829
I'll SCOOP
BOTH OF Y'ALL.

10:12.840 --> 10:16.333
SHAWN.
YOUR BROTHER'S HERE.

10:16.340 --> 10:18.172
YOUNG SHAWN: DAMN.
SHAWN'S BROTHER: YO, SHAWN.

10:18.180 --> 10:20.342
I GOT SOMETHING I NEED
YOU TO DO. LET'S GO.

10:20.350 --> 10:22.614
BUT WE FIXING
TO HOOP, BRANDON?

10:22.620 --> 10:25.180
BRANDON: NOT TODAY.
GET IN THE CAR.

10:25.190 --> 10:26.612
WHAT HE WANT
YOU TO DO?

10:26.620 --> 10:28.384
PROBABLY STEAL
SOMETHING.

10:28.390 --> 10:30.688
FOR REAL?

10:30.690 --> 10:33.125
LATER, COOP.
SEE YOU AROUND, SPENCE.

10:51.480 --> 10:52.470
BIG SPENCE.

10:52.480 --> 10:53.675
HEY, WHAT UP,
COACH?

10:53.680 --> 10:55.569
WE GOT QUITE A DAY
TODAY, HUH?

10:55.580 --> 10:57.912
WE DO?

10:57.920 --> 10:59.843
WAIT, FOR REAL? WHAT I TOLD
YOU ABOUT THE SCRIMMAGE.

10:59.850 --> 11:01.409
SCRIMMAGE. SCRIMMAGE.
MY BAD.

11:01.420 --> 11:02.819
YEAH. I'll BE READY.

11:02.820 --> 11:04.584
I CERTAINLY HOPE SO.

11:04.590 --> 11:05.989
THE "L.A. TRIBUNE"
IS SENDING A REPORTER

11:05.990 --> 11:08.220
TO INTERVIEW YOU.

11:08.230 --> 11:09.322
I GOT TO TALK
TO THEM?

11:09.330 --> 11:10.661
THEY NAMED YOU
PLAYER OF THE YEAR.

11:10.670 --> 11:11.899
I THINK THEY DESERVE
SOME FACE TIME.

11:11.900 --> 11:13.868
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I'D SAY.

11:13.870 --> 11:15.668
SPENCE, I KNOW
THAT THERE'S A LOT

11:15.670 --> 11:17.832
GOING ON AT HOME,
BUT NOW IS NOT THE TIME

11:17.840 --> 11:19.433
TO--TO LOSE FOCUS.

11:19.440 --> 11:21.534
I'll DO MY PART ON
THE FIELD, ALL RIGHT?

11:21.540 --> 11:23.406
I'M TALKING ABOUT
OFF THE FIELD.

11:23.410 --> 11:26.380
SORRY, BUT MY MIND'S ON
MY COMMUNITY RIGHT NOW.

11:26.380 --> 11:27.939
I ALREADY TOLD YOU
THEY NEED ME.

11:27.950 --> 11:29.873
THEY NEED YOU.

11:29.880 --> 11:31.245
WHAT DO THEY
NEED FROM YOU?

11:31.250 --> 11:32.786
THEY NEED ME
TO GIVE THEM HOPE.

11:32.790 --> 11:34.588
THEY'RE LOOKING
AT ME AND SEEING

11:34.590 --> 11:36.922
NOT EVERY KID FROM CRENSHAW
GOTTA END UP LIKE SHAWN.

11:36.930 --> 11:38.250
I USED TO SAY
THE SAME THING

11:38.260 --> 11:39.557
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE.

11:39.560 --> 11:41.892
I--I REMEMBER I WANTED
TO SAVE MY COMMUNITY.

11:41.900 --> 11:43.766
I AIN'T TRYING TO SAVE
NOBODY, ALL RIGHT?

11:43.770 --> 11:45.295
I JUST DON'T WANT
THEM THINKING

11:45.300 --> 11:47.689
I LEFT AND FORGOT
ABOUT THEM, THAT'S ALL.

11:47.700 --> 11:49.259
HMM.

11:54.740 --> 11:55.969
SPENCE, WHEN I LEFT,

11:55.980 --> 11:57.277
IT WASN'T BECAUSE
I DIDN'T HAVE LOVE

11:57.280 --> 11:58.600
FOR MY COMMUNITY.

11:58.610 --> 12:01.318
I COULDN'T CARRY
THAT BURDEN ANYMORE.

12:01.320 --> 12:03.049
I COULDN'T.

12:03.050 --> 12:05.439
SO, YEAH, REMEMBER
WHO YOU ARE,

12:05.450 --> 12:07.282
REMEMBER WHERE
YOU CAME FROM,

12:07.290 --> 12:10.055
BUT DON'T LET THE BURDEN
OF YOUR COMMUNITY

12:10.060 --> 12:11.380
WEIGH YOU DOWN.

12:16.460 --> 12:17.621
HEY. MY BAD.

12:17.630 --> 12:18.722
TAKE THAT.

12:21.970 --> 12:22.960
PATIENCE.

12:22.970 --> 12:24.005
YO, SPENCER.

12:24.010 --> 12:25.466
SPENCER:
WHAT? COOP OK?

12:25.470 --> 12:27.006
YEAH, I MEAN,
SHE'S GOOD RIGHT NOW,

12:27.010 --> 12:29.001
BUT SHE'S NOT
ACTING LIKE HERSELF.

12:29.010 --> 12:30.375
SO, WHO IS SHE
ACTING LIKE?

12:30.380 --> 12:32.405
PATIENCE:
LIKE SHAWN.

12:32.410 --> 12:33.502
WHAT YOU MEAN?

12:33.510 --> 12:35.342
I DON'T KNOW.
SHE'S TALKING CRAZY.

12:35.350 --> 12:37.409
LIKE ABOUT GETTING REVENGE
FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.

12:37.420 --> 12:38.649
COME ON. WE BOTH
KNOW THAT AIN'T COOP.

12:38.650 --> 12:40.311
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
I'M SAYING.

12:40.320 --> 12:41.754
AND SHE'S NOT
PLAYING AROUND.

12:41.760 --> 12:43.387
JUST 'CAUSE COOP WOULD
NEVER PULL THE TRIGGER

12:43.390 --> 12:45.324
DOESN'T MEAN SHE AIN'T
GETTING IN TOO DEEP.

12:45.330 --> 12:47.355
SHE'S NOT HEARING
ME, SPENCER, SO,

12:47.360 --> 12:49.522
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE
SHE'LL LISTEN TO YOU.

12:51.430 --> 12:52.829
ALL RIGHT.

12:57.640 --> 12:58.869
OLIVIA: WAS ASHER
SUSPENDED AGAIN

12:58.870 --> 12:59.837
OR KICKED OFF
THE TEAM FOR GOOD?

12:59.840 --> 13:01.376
NO, HE'S
OFF THE TEAM.

13:01.380 --> 13:02.609
-HOW'S HE DOING?
-HOW SHOULD I KNOW?

13:02.610 --> 13:03.771
HE'S YOUR FRIEND.

13:03.780 --> 13:05.339
NOT ANYMORE.

13:05.350 --> 13:06.374
OK, CAN WE TALK
ABOUT MY PROBLEM NOW?

13:06.380 --> 13:08.417
NOTHING'S HAPPENED
TO YOU YET.

13:08.420 --> 13:09.876
IT'S ONLY A MATTER
OF TIME, OK?

13:09.880 --> 13:11.644
AS SOON AS THOSE DRUG
TEST RESULTS COME IN,

13:11.650 --> 13:12.947
I'll MISS
THE ENTIRE PLAYOFFS,

13:12.950 --> 13:14.987
AND EVERYONE'S
GONNA KNOW WHY.

13:14.990 --> 13:16.480
I'll BE
THE SCHOOL DRUGGIE.

13:16.490 --> 13:18.481
THAT'S MY TITLE.
STAY IN YOUR LANE.

13:18.490 --> 13:19.389
YOU THINK THIS
IS FUNNY?

13:19.390 --> 13:20.721
YOU'LL LIVE,
JORDAN, OK?

13:20.730 --> 13:22.357
LOOK AT ME.
I'M ALIVE.

13:22.360 --> 13:23.498
ON MY WAY
TO CALCULUS.

13:23.500 --> 13:26.470
MM. MM.
I HATE CALCULUS.

13:26.470 --> 13:28.063
TOTALLY MISSED
MY POINT.

13:28.070 --> 13:29.890
NO, I GET IT.
I GOT IT. OK?

13:29.900 --> 13:32.562
IT'S JUST-- IT'S
DIFFERENT FOR ME, OK?

13:32.570 --> 13:33.731
COLLEGES WILL HEAR
ABOUT THIS

13:33.740 --> 13:35.538
AND NOBODY WANTS
A STONER QB.

13:35.540 --> 13:37.542
OK? NOBODY.
IT'LL TOTALLY RUIN

13:37.550 --> 13:39.507
MY CHANCES OF PLAYING
FOOTBALL AT THE NEXT LEVEL.

13:39.510 --> 13:41.569
SEE, I'M SO CONFUSED
HOW THE MALIBU COACH

13:41.580 --> 13:43.048
COULD ORDER A DRUG TEST.

13:43.050 --> 13:45.417
HE DIDN'T ORDER IT.
HE--HE FILED A PROTEST.

13:45.420 --> 13:47.980
YEAH, BUT HOW DID HE
KNOW YOU SMOKED WEED?

13:47.990 --> 13:49.856
I DON'T KNOW. IT WAS
JUST ME AND RIPLEY.

13:49.860 --> 13:51.828
NOBODY ELSE
WAS THERE.

13:51.830 --> 13:53.650
OH.

13:53.660 --> 13:54.821
WHAT?

13:54.830 --> 13:56.025
NOTHING.

13:56.030 --> 13:57.759
YOU THINK IT WAS
RIPLEY, DON'T YOU?

14:00.070 --> 14:01.560
BUT--

14:09.540 --> 14:10.905
SPENCER, WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?

14:10.910 --> 14:12.071
THE PLAYERS ARE ON THE FIELD.

14:12.080 --> 14:13.605
THE SCRIMMAGE IS ABOUT TO START.

14:13.610 --> 14:15.544
I'M SORRY, COACH. I AIN'T
GONNA BE ABLE TO MAKE IT.

14:15.550 --> 14:16.847
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

14:16.850 --> 14:17.920
LOOK, SOMETHING CAME
UP BACK HOME, ALL RIGHT?

14:17.920 --> 14:19.410
I'll BE AT
THE HOUSE TONIGHT.

14:19.420 --> 14:20.410
BILLY: UH-UH.
SPENCER.

14:20.420 --> 14:23.185
-I'M SORRY.
-SPENCER.

14:24.890 --> 14:26.051
COACH BAKER.

14:26.060 --> 14:27.550
-HEY.
-GORDON BAUER.

14:27.560 --> 14:29.096
I COVER LOCAL SPORTS
FOR THE "L.A. TRIBUNE."

14:29.100 --> 14:30.568
THANK YOU FOR
COMING OUT.

14:30.570 --> 14:31.867
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR THE AWARD.

14:31.870 --> 14:33.429
-YOU EARNED IT.
-THANK YOU.

14:33.430 --> 14:35.467
I WAS TOLD I GET 15
MINUTES WITH SPENCER JAMES

14:35.470 --> 14:36.460
BEFORE THE SCRIMMAGE.

14:36.470 --> 14:37.733
RIGHT. ABOUT THAT.

14:37.740 --> 14:39.469
I-I'M AFRAID WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO RESCHEDULE

14:39.470 --> 14:41.609
THAT INTERVIEW.,

14:41.610 --> 14:43.430
HMM. THAT'S TOO BAD.

14:43.440 --> 14:45.545
IT IS.

14:45.550 --> 14:47.939
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

14:47.950 --> 14:49.440
CAN I ASK WHY?

14:49.450 --> 14:51.942
AH, SPENCER WAS
UNABLE TO BE HERE TODAY.

14:51.950 --> 14:53.611
ONE OF THOSE, HUH?

14:53.620 --> 14:55.213
I'M SORRY?

14:55.220 --> 14:56.756
IT SEEMS LATELY, BETTER
THE PLAYER, BIGGER THE EGO.

14:56.760 --> 14:59.957
HE ACTUALLY HAS
A FAMILY EMERGENCY.

14:59.960 --> 15:01.223
-RIGHT.
-SPENCER IS THE MOST

15:01.230 --> 15:04.598
DEDICATED PLAYER
I'VE EVER COACHED.

15:04.600 --> 15:07.638
IF YOU SAY SO.

15:10.170 --> 15:12.639
OH, YOU BUGGIN' NOW, FOOL.

15:12.640 --> 15:14.608
THERE WE GO.

15:14.610 --> 15:16.977
BOOM! GONE.

15:16.980 --> 15:18.778
COOP: TYRONE,
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

15:18.780 --> 15:20.544
WHAT DO IT LOOK LIKE
WE'RE DOING?

15:20.550 --> 15:22.109
TEARING THESE
FOOLS UP.

15:22.120 --> 15:23.246
WHAT YOU GOT NEXT?

15:23.250 --> 15:24.684
YOU'RE GONNA REGRET
THAT MOVE.

15:24.690 --> 15:26.112
SO, WE ALL KNOW
WHO POPPED SHAWN

15:26.120 --> 15:28.509
AND AIN'T NOBODY
TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS?

15:28.520 --> 15:31.524
YO, COOP,
YOU GOTTA EASE UP.

15:31.530 --> 15:33.680
NAH, MAN, SHAWN
DESERVE WAY BETTER.

15:33.690 --> 15:36.159
LOOK, WE GONNA TAKE CARE
OF RAY FOR WHAT HE DID.

15:36.160 --> 15:37.559
RIGHT NOW WE GOTTA
LAY LOW.

15:37.570 --> 15:39.265
AND DO WHAT?
PLAY VIDEO GAMES?

15:39.270 --> 15:42.137
OK. I LIKE THIS
SIDE OF YOU, COOP.

15:42.140 --> 15:44.029
I DIDN'T THINK
YOU HAD IT IN YOU.

15:44.040 --> 15:45.838
SPENCER: COOP.

15:45.840 --> 15:47.672
SPENCER JAMES.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.000
IT'S BEEN A MINUTE.

15:49.010 --> 15:50.671
I AIN'T HERE
FOR NO REUNION.

15:50.680 --> 15:52.944
IS YOU FORGETTING
WHERE YOU AT?

15:52.950 --> 15:54.543
COOP: SPENCER, COME ON, DUDE.

15:58.190 --> 16:00.181
SO, WHAT'S THE BIG
PLAN HERE, COOP?

16:00.190 --> 16:01.555
-PLAN?
-I KNOW YOU GETTING SOMEBODY BACK

16:01.560 --> 16:03.050
FOR WHAT HAPPENED
TO SHAWN, SO, WHAT'S UP?

16:03.060 --> 16:04.585
I TOLD YOU. I DON'T
NEED NO BABY-SITTER.

16:04.590 --> 16:06.649
NO. IT SOUNDS LIKE
MAYBE YOU DO.

16:06.660 --> 16:08.526
-WHY YOU GOT TO DO THIS?
-BECAUSE SHAWN HAD MY BACK

16:08.530 --> 16:10.225
-AND NOW I GOT HIS.
-SHAWN'S GONE, ALL RIGHT?

16:10.230 --> 16:11.664
HE DON'T NEED NOBODY
HAVING HIS BACK, NOT NO MORE.

16:11.670 --> 16:13.024
WHY CAN'T YOU
STAY OUT OF THIS?

16:13.030 --> 16:15.670
I TOLD YOU. I AIN'T
GOING NOWHERE.

16:15.670 --> 16:17.707
I'MMA STAY RIGHT HERE
UNTIL YOU LOOK ME IN MY EYE

16:17.710 --> 16:20.202
AND PROMISE ME YOU AIN'T
GONNA DO NOTHING STUPID.

16:20.210 --> 16:21.974
I WON'T MAKE THE
SAME MISTAKE TWICE.

16:21.980 --> 16:23.072
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

16:23.080 --> 16:24.570
I'M TALKING ABOUT
SHAWN, FOOL.

16:24.580 --> 16:26.548
SHAWN: WHAT YOU
DOING HERE, SPENCE?

16:26.550 --> 16:28.018
I HEARD ABOUT
YOUR BROTHER.

16:30.620 --> 16:32.247
I GUESS IT WAS
JUST HIS TIME.

16:38.560 --> 16:40.551
I'M SORRY ABOUT
BRANDON, SHAWN.

16:43.630 --> 16:45.166
I'MMA TAKE CARE
OF IT.

16:45.170 --> 16:47.696
WHAT YOU MEAN?

16:47.700 --> 16:50.704
TYRONE: YO, SHAWN.
LET'S GO.

16:50.710 --> 16:53.031
WHAT UP, SPENCE?
IT'S BEEN A MINUTE.

16:53.040 --> 16:55.236
YOU RUNNING WITH US
TODAY OR WHAT?

16:55.240 --> 16:58.574
NAH. SPENCER ALWAYS GOT
SOMEWHERE BETTER TO BE.

16:58.580 --> 17:01.015
YOU AIN'T GOTTA
DO THIS, SHAWN.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.011
SEE YOU AROUND,
SPENCE.

17:06.089 --> 17:07.717
TYRONE: READY?

17:07.720 --> 17:09.017
SPENCER: HE WANTED
PAYBACK JUST LIKE THIS

17:09.020 --> 17:10.657
WHEN HIS BROTHER DIED,

17:10.660 --> 17:11.582
AND I TRIED
TO TALK TO HIM,

17:11.589 --> 17:12.887
BUT I DIDN'T DO ENOUGH.

17:12.890 --> 17:14.096
I KEEP THINKING MAYBE
I COULD'VE STOPPED HIM

17:14.099 --> 17:15.897
FROM GOING DOWN
THIS PATH,

17:15.900 --> 17:17.299
BUT I'M DAMN SURE
GONNA STOP YOU

17:17.300 --> 17:18.790
FROM GOING DOWN THIS
PATH, ALL RIGHT?

17:18.800 --> 17:20.768
BELIEVE THAT.

17:20.770 --> 17:24.604
YOU'RE NOT BUILT
FOR THIS LIFE, COOP,

17:24.609 --> 17:25.702
AND THAT DON'T MEAN
YOU WEAK, ALL RIGHT?

17:25.710 --> 17:27.303
IT MEANS YOU STRONG.

17:39.290 --> 17:41.657
GAME.
WANT TO GO AGAIN?

17:44.330 --> 17:46.628
SO, THIS IS WHERE YOU'VE
BEEN HIDING OUT.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.320
I'M NOT HIDING.

17:50.800 --> 17:53.622
YOU A POOL HUSTLER NOW?
IS THAT THE PLAN?

17:53.630 --> 17:54.768
MAYBE.

17:54.770 --> 17:57.660
YOU'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH
AT POOL.

17:57.670 --> 18:00.105
THANKS.

18:00.110 --> 18:02.078
YOU KNOW, I WAS
GOOD ENOUGH AT FOOTBALL.

18:02.080 --> 18:03.309
THAT DIDN'T
WORK OUT.

18:03.310 --> 18:05.108
OH, THIS IS
A PITY PARTY.

18:05.110 --> 18:06.100
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO, LEILA?

18:06.110 --> 18:07.100
GO TO CLASS.

18:07.110 --> 18:08.646
WHY?
WHAT'S THE POINT?

18:08.650 --> 18:10.687
UM, OTHER THAN
AN EDUCATION?

18:10.690 --> 18:12.340
LET'S SEE.

18:12.350 --> 18:13.681
NOBODY WANTS ME
TO COME BACK.

18:13.690 --> 18:15.749
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

18:15.760 --> 18:17.159
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE
HURTING RIGHT NOW,

18:17.160 --> 18:18.958
AND IT FEELS LIKE
YOU'VE LOST EVERYTHING

18:18.960 --> 18:22.089
AND YOU'RE ALL ALONE,
BUT I PROMISE YOU,

18:22.100 --> 18:23.966
THERE IS ALWAYS
A WAY BACK.

18:25.800 --> 18:28.292
WOMAN: YOU GOTTA GO

18:28.300 --> 18:30.837
GOTTA RIGHT NOW

18:30.840 --> 18:33.707
GOTTA GO NOW

18:33.710 --> 18:35.132
YOU GOTTA GO

18:35.140 --> 18:37.370
HEY.

18:37.380 --> 18:38.870
YOUR DAD
LET ME IN.

18:38.880 --> 18:40.644
OH, COOL.

18:42.180 --> 18:43.875
BROUGHT YOU
A PHONE CHARGER

18:43.880 --> 18:45.814
BECAUSE I'VE CALLED
AND TEXTED YOU ALL DAY

18:45.820 --> 18:47.857
AND YOU
HAVEN'T RESPONDED.

18:47.860 --> 18:49.851
SO, I ASSUMED YOUR
PHONE MUST'VE DIED.

18:49.860 --> 18:51.828
I KNOW.
I'M SORRY.

18:51.830 --> 18:53.320
OK? IT'S JUST

18:53.330 --> 18:54.798
THE DRUG TEST RESULTS
COME OUT TOMORROW

18:54.800 --> 18:57.121
AND THAT'LL PRETTY MUCH
BE THE END OF MY LIFE.

18:57.130 --> 18:59.167
WELL, THAT'S
A LITTLE DRAMATIC.

18:59.170 --> 19:00.763
I MISSED
THE PLAYOFFS.

19:00.770 --> 19:03.296
OH, NO.
NOT THE PLAYOFFS.

19:03.300 --> 19:04.836
OK.

19:04.840 --> 19:06.205
WOULD THAT REALLY BE
THE WORST THING

19:06.210 --> 19:07.905
IN THE WORLD?

19:07.910 --> 19:10.299
IT JUST MEANS WE GET TO
SPEND MORE TIME TOGETHER.

19:14.250 --> 19:16.776
IS THAT WHAT
YOU WANTED?

19:16.780 --> 19:18.714
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY THAT?

19:18.720 --> 19:19.846
RIPLEY, DID YOU
TELL SOMEONE

19:19.850 --> 19:21.056
THAT WE SMOKED
WEED TOGETHER?

19:21.060 --> 19:22.380
OF COURSE NOT.

19:22.390 --> 19:24.051
OK, HOW'D THE MALIBU
COACH FIND OUT THEN?

19:24.060 --> 19:25.323
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
HE KNEW?

19:25.330 --> 19:26.354
HE FILED A PROTEST.

19:26.360 --> 19:28.727
FOR THE ENTIRE TEAM.

19:28.730 --> 19:29.925
DON'T YOU THINK IF
HE KNEW IT WAS YOU,

19:29.930 --> 19:31.921
HE WOULD'VE JUST
REPORTED YOU?

19:33.900 --> 19:35.789
I DON'T LIKE YOU
RIGHT NOW.

19:35.800 --> 19:38.406
-RIPLEY, GET-- -AND WHEN I
DON'T ANSWER YOUR PHONE CALLS,

19:38.410 --> 19:40.367
YOU CAN JUST ASSUME
MY PHONE DIED.

19:47.750 --> 19:48.820
HEY, MISS RUTH.

19:48.820 --> 19:50.049
RUTH: HEY, TAMIA.

19:50.050 --> 19:52.815
I CAME BY TO GET
SOME OF MAYA'S THINGS.

19:52.820 --> 19:55.881
TYRONE OFFERED
TO HELP ME CARRY THEM.

19:55.890 --> 19:58.882
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING HERE
IS YOURS NOW.

19:58.890 --> 20:00.528
YOU COULD TAKE
THE VIDEO GAMES.

20:00.530 --> 20:02.123
MAYA AIN'T
PLAYING THOSE.

20:02.130 --> 20:04.394
SHAWN WASTED TOO MUCH
TIME ON GAMES.

20:04.400 --> 20:05.765
YOU CAN HAVE THEM
IF YOU WANT THEM.

20:05.770 --> 20:07.226
NAH,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:07.230 --> 20:09.198
VIDEO GAMES ARE
A WASTE OF TIME.

20:10.810 --> 20:12.232
RUTH: SEE YOU TOMORROW?
COOP: YEAH.

20:12.240 --> 20:13.401
I'll BE THERE.

20:13.410 --> 20:14.832
RUTH: OK.

20:14.840 --> 20:15.773
MISS RUTH, I'll
CATCH YOU OUTSIDE.

20:15.780 --> 20:16.975
ALL RIGHT.

20:16.980 --> 20:18.243
SO, I'VE BEEN THINKING IT OVER.

20:19.780 --> 20:21.839
I LIKE WHAT I SAW
FROM YOU TODAY.

20:23.080 --> 20:24.411
I GOT A OPPORTUNITY
FOR YOU.

20:24.420 --> 20:25.490
DOING WHAT?

20:25.490 --> 20:26.548
SHAWN WAS
A GOOD EARNER.

20:26.550 --> 20:28.109
REST IN PEACE.

20:28.120 --> 20:30.782
I'M GIVING YOU
HIS SPOT.

20:30.790 --> 20:31.928
ACTUALLY, I'M GOOD.

20:31.930 --> 20:32.988
ACTUALLY, I
AIN'T ASKING.

20:32.990 --> 20:34.321
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT.

20:34.330 --> 20:36.424
BUT I'M STILL SAYING NO.
I DON'T WANT IT.

20:36.430 --> 20:37.568
YOU'RE BEING
WEAK, COOP.

20:37.570 --> 20:41.097
NO. NO.
I'M BEING STRONG.

20:41.100 --> 20:44.968
IF YOU GOTTA
DO SOMETHING, DO IT.

20:44.970 --> 20:47.166
I'MMA LET THAT GO.

20:47.170 --> 20:48.899
FOR SHAWN.

20:48.910 --> 20:50.469
BUT DON'T PUSH IT.

20:52.810 --> 20:54.744
I'll BE BACK
FOR THE VIDEO GAMES.

21:04.190 --> 21:05.988
SPENCER,
IN HERE, PLEASE.

21:11.030 --> 21:12.862
WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED TODAY?

21:12.870 --> 21:13.962
I WAS LOOKING OUT
FOR A FRIEND.

21:13.970 --> 21:14.960
WELL, NOW YOU'RE
GONNA START

21:14.970 --> 21:15.937
LOOKING OUT
FOR YOURSELF.

21:15.940 --> 21:17.465
THAT'S YOUR MOVE.

21:17.470 --> 21:18.904
EXCUSE ME?

21:18.910 --> 21:19.968
WHAT WAS IT
YOU TOLD ME BEFORE?

21:19.970 --> 21:20.971
MY COMMUNITY'S
A BURDEN?

21:20.980 --> 21:22.300
IT CAN BE, YES.

21:22.310 --> 21:23.436
YEAH, WELL, IT'S NOT
A BURDEN, ALL RIGHT?

21:23.440 --> 21:25.340
IT'S A RESPONSIBILITY.

21:25.350 --> 21:26.545
YOU THE ONE FORGOT
WHERE YOU CAME FROM.

21:26.550 --> 21:28.211
WATCH YOUR MOUTH,
SON.

21:29.950 --> 21:31.145
I'M JUST TRYING TO
GIVE YOU SOME ADVICE.

21:31.150 --> 21:32.220
HOW CAN I
TAKE YOUR ADVICE

21:32.220 --> 21:33.449
WHEN I CAN'T EVEN
TRUST YOU?

21:33.450 --> 21:34.849
YOU GOT
SO MANY SECRETS.

21:34.860 --> 21:36.009
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
YOU AND MY POPS

21:36.020 --> 21:37.181
WAS UP FOR
THE SAME JOB.

21:37.190 --> 21:38.521
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT ARE YOU IMPLYING?

21:38.530 --> 21:39.850
THAT I TOOK THAT JOB
FROM YOUR POPS?

21:39.860 --> 21:40.998
NO. I'M SAYING
IT'S ONE MORE THING

21:41.000 --> 21:42.798
I SHOULD'VE
KNOWN ABOUT.

21:45.200 --> 21:48.170
OK.

21:48.170 --> 21:49.569
ALL RIGHT.

21:49.570 --> 21:51.004
WELL, I NEED
FOR YOU TO BE ABLE

21:51.010 --> 21:52.500
TO TRUST ME.

21:52.510 --> 21:54.308
SO, LOOK,
EVERYTHING I'M DOING

21:54.310 --> 21:55.539
IS TO PROTECT
YOUR FUTURE.

21:55.540 --> 21:57.235
MY FUTURE
OR YOUR FUTURE?

21:59.880 --> 22:01.314
I NEED YOU
TO LOOK AT THIS.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.879
- I GOT HOMEW--
-COME HERE AND LOOK AT THIS.

22:06.390 --> 22:08.154
THIS IS GORDON BAUER.

22:08.160 --> 22:11.221
HE'S A SPORTS REPORTER
FOR THE "L.A. TRIBUNE."

22:11.230 --> 22:13.255
HE WAS SUPPOSED
TO INTERVIEW YOU.

22:13.260 --> 22:15.228
WHEN YOU GHOSTED HIM,
HE GOT UPSET

22:15.230 --> 22:17.392
AND WROTE ABOUT IT
TO HIS 98,000 FOLLOWERS.

22:17.400 --> 22:19.027
I DON'T CARE WHAT HE
WRITES ABOUT ME, ALL RIGHT?

22:19.030 --> 22:20.100
AND I DON'T NEED
NO DAMN AWARD.

22:20.100 --> 22:21.659
WHAT YOU DON'T
NEED IS--

22:21.670 --> 22:24.162
-NAH, GO AHEAD, MAN.
-DON'T WALK AWAY FROM ME!

22:30.180 --> 22:33.571
DO YOU WANT TO BE
AN ALL AMERICAN?

22:33.580 --> 22:35.514
THERE ARE TWO GAMES
YOU GOTTA PLAY.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.113
ONE IS OUT THERE
ON THE FIELD.

22:37.120 --> 22:38.918
THE OTHER ONE IS
RIGHT HERE.

22:40.120 --> 22:43.454
IF YOU BLOW OFF THIS
AWARDS CEREMONY,

22:43.460 --> 22:45.121
THOSE ARE HEADLINES.

22:45.130 --> 22:47.383
COLLEGES DON'T LIKE
HEADLINES.

22:47.390 --> 22:49.051
AND WHEN COLLEGES
DON'T LIKE YOU,

22:49.060 --> 22:50.619
NO NFL.

22:53.930 --> 22:55.534
SO, BELIEVE IT
OR NOT,

22:55.540 --> 22:57.907
I'M TRYING TO
PROTECT YOUR FUTURE.

22:59.570 --> 23:01.379
DISMISSED.

23:20.090 --> 23:21.489
LEILA: "SPENCER JAMES'
RARE TALENT

23:21.500 --> 23:24.424
DOESN'T JUSTIFY HIS
PRIMA DONNA ATTITUDE."

23:24.430 --> 23:25.989
WAIT. WHO IS THIS JERK?

23:26.000 --> 23:26.967
SOMEBODY WITH
A LOT OF FOLLOWERS.

23:26.970 --> 23:28.290
HE DOESN'T EVEN
KNOW YOU.

23:28.300 --> 23:30.064
"SPENCER JAMES'
WORK ETHIC

23:30.070 --> 23:32.164
IS AN INSULT TO HIS
LESSER-TALENTED TEAMMATES."

23:32.170 --> 23:34.138
NOW HE DOGGING
MY TEAM.

23:34.140 --> 23:36.336
"THIS YEAR'S PLAYER OF THE
YEAR PLAYS WHEN HE WANTS TO."

23:36.340 --> 23:37.478
YOU CAN STOP
READING NOW.

23:37.480 --> 23:38.641
SORRY.

23:38.650 --> 23:40.049
LOOK,
IT DON'T MATTER.

23:40.050 --> 23:41.279
NO, IT DOES MATTER.

23:41.280 --> 23:42.611
BABY, THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO ABOUT IT NOW.

23:42.620 --> 23:43.974
WELL, YOU CAN GO
TO THE CEREMONY

23:43.980 --> 23:45.118
AND SHOW THEM
THE REAL YOU.

23:45.120 --> 23:46.417
YOU SOUND
JUST LIKE COACH.

23:46.420 --> 23:47.751
HE WANTS ME TO GO DANCE
FOR THESE REPORTERS.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.455
I'M NOT ASKING YOU
TO DANCE FOR ANYBODY.

23:49.460 --> 23:51.121
JUST GO AND BE YOURSELF.

23:51.130 --> 23:54.122
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
NOT TO LIKE YOU.

23:54.130 --> 23:56.121
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW IF
I DESERVE THIS AWARD ANYWAY.

23:56.130 --> 23:57.495
I ONLY WON 'CAUSE
I WAS GIVEN

23:57.500 --> 23:58.990
THE GOLDEN TICKET
OUT OF CRENSHAW.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.024
HOW IS THAT FAIR?

24:00.030 --> 24:01.191
NO, YOU WON BECAUSE
YOU'RE THE BEST

24:01.200 --> 24:02.599
PLAYER ON THE FIELD.

24:02.600 --> 24:04.762
EVERY SINGLE GAME.

24:04.770 --> 24:08.206
AND I'M REALLY GLAD YOU
GOT THAT GOLDEN TICKET,

24:08.210 --> 24:09.530
BECAUSE IF YOU
DIDN'T, I WOULDN'T HAVE

24:09.540 --> 24:11.508
A SECRET BOYFRIEND
RIGHT NOW.

24:17.020 --> 24:18.112
HEY, DAD.

24:18.120 --> 24:19.144
HEY, YOU GUYS,

24:19.150 --> 24:20.618
WHEN YOU HEAR A SPEECH,

24:20.620 --> 24:22.554
DO YOU LIKE IT WHEN
IT OPENS WITH A JOKE?

24:22.560 --> 24:23.550
DEPENDS.

24:23.560 --> 24:24.527
DEPENDS ON WHAT?

24:24.530 --> 24:25.656
IF THE PERSON'S
FUNNY.

24:25.660 --> 24:28.152
I'M FUNNY.
AM I FUNNY?

24:28.160 --> 24:31.164
AH... MAYBE DON'T LEAD
WITH A JOKE, NO.

24:31.170 --> 24:33.059
MAYBE DON'T...
WHAT DID YOU WANT?

24:33.070 --> 24:35.664
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT THE DRUG TEST.

24:35.670 --> 24:37.365
SHE KNOWS
EVERYTHING ALREADY.

24:37.370 --> 24:39.566
OH. AH, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THAT TEST.

24:39.570 --> 24:41.106
DAD, YOU KEEP SAYING
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT--

24:41.110 --> 24:42.703
YOU PASSED.

24:42.710 --> 24:44.542
-WHAT?
-EVERYONE ON THE TEAM PASSED,

24:44.550 --> 24:46.040
INCLUDING YOU.

24:47.410 --> 24:50.141
OK, HOW--HOW IS
THAT POSSIBLE?

24:50.150 --> 24:52.312
WELL, YOU GOT LUCKY.

24:52.320 --> 24:54.482
THE DRUG LEFT YOUR
SYSTEM BEFORE THE TEST.

24:57.420 --> 24:59.058
JORDAN: SWEET.

24:59.060 --> 25:00.755
WAIT--DO YOU THINK
THE MALIBU COACH KNEW

25:00.760 --> 25:02.057
THAT I SMOKED WEED?

25:02.060 --> 25:03.323
I DOUBT IT.
IF HE KNEW,

25:03.330 --> 25:05.822
HE WOULDN'T HAVE
REPORTED THE WHOLE TEAM.

25:05.830 --> 25:08.060
RIGHT. RIGHT. OK.
THANKS, DAD.

25:08.070 --> 25:09.196
BILLY: YUP.

25:11.370 --> 25:14.067
SO, NO JOKE?

25:14.070 --> 25:16.072
I WOULDN'T.

25:16.080 --> 25:19.209
I'M FUNNY.

25:19.210 --> 25:21.212
OK.

25:21.220 --> 25:22.369
I THOUGHT IT TOOK
AT LEAST 8 DAYS

25:22.380 --> 25:25.611
FOR MARIJUANA
TO LEAVE YOUR SYSTEM.

25:25.620 --> 25:28.157
LIKE I SAID,
GOT LUCKY.

25:29.620 --> 25:30.712
OK.

25:39.270 --> 25:40.419
HEY!

25:40.430 --> 25:42.296
MY BOY LOOKIN' SHARP!

25:42.300 --> 25:43.529
YEAH?

25:43.540 --> 25:45.235
I'M GLAD
YOU AND LEILA

25:45.240 --> 25:47.299
ARE IN A SECRET
RELATIONSHIP.

25:47.310 --> 25:49.199
THAT WAY, I CAN
BE YOUR DATE.

25:49.210 --> 25:51.178
YOU'RE ALWAYS GONNA
BE MY DATE, MOM.

25:51.180 --> 25:54.241
OHH. MWAH.

25:57.620 --> 25:59.748
YOU OK, BABY?

25:59.750 --> 26:02.117
I DON'T KNOW.

26:02.120 --> 26:03.485
THERE'S A QUESTION I'VE
BEEN TRYING TO ANSWER

26:03.490 --> 26:05.481
FOR A FEW DAYS.

26:05.490 --> 26:08.790
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE YOU
CAN ANSWER IT FOR ME.

26:08.800 --> 26:11.292
I CAN TRY.

26:11.300 --> 26:13.268
WHY ME, MA?

26:13.270 --> 26:15.261
WHY'D I GET THE CHANCE TO
TRANSFER TO BEVERLY HILLS

26:15.270 --> 26:17.193
AND--AND PEOPLE LIKE
SHAWN NEVER GET

26:17.200 --> 26:18.907
ANYTHING HANDED
TO THEM?

26:18.910 --> 26:20.765
I TOLD YOU.

26:20.770 --> 26:23.831
YOU MADE YOUR
PATH AND...

26:23.840 --> 26:25.205
SHAWN MADE
HIS OWN PATH.

26:25.210 --> 26:27.247
BUT HE DIDN'T.

26:27.250 --> 26:28.513
MA, ME AND SHAWN USED
TO BE THE SAME KID.

26:28.520 --> 26:30.147
WE LIKED DOING
THE SAME THINGS.

26:30.150 --> 26:31.788
IT WAS HIS BROTHER THAT
PUT HIM INTO THAT LIFE.

26:31.790 --> 26:33.246
BABY...

26:35.290 --> 26:37.679
THIS IS LIFE
IN CRENSHAW.

26:37.690 --> 26:40.159
EVERYONE HERE HAS
TO WORK TWICE AS HARD

26:40.160 --> 26:42.197
JUST TO KEEP UP WITH
THE REST OF THE WORLD.

26:42.200 --> 26:43.349
MOST OF US DON'T
EVEN START THE RACE

26:43.360 --> 26:45.795
UNTIL IT'S OVER.

26:45.800 --> 26:48.497
YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN
A CHANCE TO START ON TIME,

26:48.500 --> 26:50.764
AND THAT'S NOT
AN ADVANTAGE, SPENCER.

26:50.770 --> 26:54.775
THAT'S A EQUAL
OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED.

26:54.780 --> 26:57.704
SO, GO WIN THAT RACE
FOR THE REST OF US.

27:00.310 --> 27:02.347
REMEMBER...

27:02.350 --> 27:04.239
IT'S WHAT YOU DO
WITH YOUR SUCCESS

27:04.250 --> 27:06.218
THAT MATTERS.

27:06.220 --> 27:09.190
OK?

27:09.190 --> 27:10.612
COME HERE.

27:14.190 --> 27:16.158
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

27:20.700 --> 27:22.338
MAN: YOU BETTER
BE LOST.

27:22.340 --> 27:24.195
COOP: HEY, MAN, I JUST
WANTED TO TALK.

27:24.200 --> 27:25.201
ABOUT WHAT?

27:25.210 --> 27:26.700
IN CASE YOU
WAS WONDERING,

27:26.710 --> 27:28.200
AIN'T NOBODY COMING
AFTER YOU, MAN.

27:28.210 --> 27:29.302
IT'S OVER.

27:32.250 --> 27:33.649
THAT'S SHAWN'S BAG.

27:33.650 --> 27:35.744
HE GAVE IT
TO TYRONE, RIGHT?

27:35.750 --> 27:36.876
DID TYRONE GIVE YOU
THAT BAG?

27:36.880 --> 27:38.882
MIND YOUR BUSINESS.

27:38.890 --> 27:40.984
TYRONE DON'T PART WITH
HIS MONEY EASILY, MAN.

27:40.990 --> 27:43.254
YOU'RE RIGHT.
HE DON'T.

27:46.390 --> 27:47.585
DID TYRONE TELL YOU--

27:47.590 --> 27:49.354
LEAVE IT ALONE.

27:49.360 --> 27:50.725
WHATEVER YOU ABOUT
TO ASK, DON'T.

27:50.730 --> 27:51.891
YOUR BOY ALREADY GONE.

27:51.900 --> 27:53.493
AIN'T NOTHING GONNA
CHANGE THAT.

27:53.500 --> 27:55.662
ANYTHING ELSE YOU TRY
TO DO AT THIS POINT

27:55.670 --> 27:57.195
GONNA GET YOU KILLED.

28:12.790 --> 28:14.383
BILLY: ACTUALLY, I HAVE
A CONFESSION TO MAKE.

28:14.390 --> 28:19.419
UH, MY KIDS HELPED ME WRITE
THIS SPEECH TONIGHT

28:19.430 --> 28:21.592
AND, UH, I WAS GONNA OPEN WITH

28:21.600 --> 28:23.898
WHAT I THOUGHT
WAS A--A STRONG JOKE,

28:23.900 --> 28:27.564
BUT APPARENTLY, UH,
I'M NOT VERY FUNNY.

28:28.870 --> 28:30.861
HA HA. I'D LIKE
TO THANK MY WIFE,

28:30.870 --> 28:31.860
MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE.

28:31.870 --> 28:33.565
SHE COULDN'T BE HERE,

28:33.570 --> 28:35.538
BUT WITHOUT HER,

28:35.540 --> 28:37.372
NONE OF THIS WOULD BE POSSIBLE.

28:37.380 --> 28:39.371
UH, I'D LIKE TO THANK
THE BOOSTERS

28:39.380 --> 28:42.315
WHO SUPPORT WHAT
WE'RE TRYING TO DO.

28:42.320 --> 28:45.415
AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST,
MY TEAM.

28:45.420 --> 28:47.411
-MY BOYS.

28:47.420 --> 28:51.755
EVERY TIME WE WERE FACED
WITH ADVERSITY THIS YEAR,

28:51.760 --> 28:53.649
THEY CAME BACK EVEN STRONGER.

28:53.660 --> 28:57.358
THEY HAVE REPRESENTED
OUR PROGRAM WITH INTEGRITY

28:57.360 --> 28:59.670
AND ACCOUNTABILITY.

28:59.670 --> 29:02.560
ANYWAY, WE'VE GOT
SOME WORK LEFT TO DO,

29:02.570 --> 29:06.302
BUT, UH, I'M VERY PROUD
TO BE HEAD COACH

29:06.310 --> 29:09.371
AT BEVERLY, SO, THANK YOU
FOR THIS HONOR. THANK YOU.

29:15.380 --> 29:17.314

TYRONE: YEAH.

29:18.920 --> 29:20.979
TYRONE: I'M HERE FOR YOU
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.

29:20.990 --> 29:22.788
RUTH: THANK YOU. TYRONE:

29:22.790 --> 29:24.519
RUTH: I KNOW YOU DO.
THANK YOU.

29:24.520 --> 29:27.080
TYRONE: SHAWN WAS
A GOOD BOY.

29:27.090 --> 29:28.649
HE WAS A GOOD BOY.

29:35.340 --> 29:37.434
OUR FINAL AWARD OF THE NIGHT

29:37.440 --> 29:40.808
IS FOR THE DIVISION
PLAYER OF THE YEAR,

29:40.810 --> 29:42.835
ALSO FROM BEVERLY HIGH.

29:42.840 --> 29:43.932
SPENCER JAMES.

29:56.390 --> 29:57.789
SPENCER: THANK YOU.

29:57.790 --> 30:01.351
I, UH...WROTE DOWN
A LIST OF NAMES TO THANK.

30:03.830 --> 30:07.824
I WANT TO THANK COACH BAKER;
MY TEAM:;

30:07.830 --> 30:13.337
JORDAN BAKER, MY QB;
MY MOM; MY BROTHER DILLON.

30:33.460 --> 30:35.690
YOU KNOW, LOOKING DOWN
AT THAT LIST OF NAMES

30:35.700 --> 30:38.920
REMINDS ME OF ANOTHER LIST.

30:38.930 --> 30:42.935
QUINTELL DENNIS.
MARCUS HEARD.

30:42.940 --> 30:46.433
TYSON GLOVER.
JAMERRILL MAXWELL.

30:48.410 --> 30:50.071
AND SHAWN SCOTT.

30:51.780 --> 30:54.078
YOU AIN'T NEVER HEARD OF THEM.

30:54.080 --> 30:56.117
THEY NEVER GOT THE CHANCE
TO STAND ON NO STAGE

30:56.120 --> 30:57.918
AND ACCEPT AN AWARD.

31:00.020 --> 31:02.455
AND THEY ALL LOST
THEIR LIVES THIS YEAR.

31:06.430 --> 31:09.058
SEE, WHEN A GANG MEMBER DIES,
EVERYBODY JUST SHRUGS,

31:09.060 --> 31:13.019
THINKING, "HEY, THEY CHOSE
THIS LIFE, RIGHT?"

31:13.030 --> 31:15.931
LET'S FACE IT.
MOST OF THEIR STORIES

31:15.940 --> 31:18.068
WERE WRITTEN THE DAY
THEY WERE BORN.

31:18.070 --> 31:20.061
THEY NEVER HAD
THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES.

31:21.910 --> 31:25.608
I THINK IT'S TIME
WE STOPPED SHRUGGING.

31:25.610 --> 31:28.819
BECAUSE FROM NOW ON,
I'M WINNING THIS RACE FOR THEM.

31:28.820 --> 31:31.448
IT AIN'T JUST
ABOUT SCHOLARSHIPS

31:31.450 --> 31:33.714
OR MAKING IT TO THE NFL.

31:33.720 --> 31:35.449
IT'S ABOUT GIVING BACK
TO WHERE I CAME FROM

31:35.460 --> 31:36.985
AS MUCH AS I CAN.

31:38.460 --> 31:40.929
IT'S ABOUT GIVING THEM
MORE OPPORTUNITIES

31:40.930 --> 31:42.921
SO THEY CAN WRITE
THEIR OWN STORIES.

31:47.530 --> 31:48.668
THANK YOU.

32:02.180 --> 32:05.115
I NEED TO TALK
TO YOU.

32:05.120 --> 32:06.747
DID YOU BOX THOSE
VIDEO GAMES UP?

32:06.750 --> 32:08.514
FORGET THOSE
VIDEO GAMES.

32:08.520 --> 32:10.909
-WHAT'S UP?
-I WANT IN.

32:10.920 --> 32:12.957
-IN WHAT?
-SHAWN'S SPOT.

32:12.960 --> 32:14.485
-IT'S GONE.
-TO WHO?

32:14.490 --> 32:16.151
IT DON'T MATTER.

32:16.160 --> 32:18.128
YOU SAID NO.

32:18.130 --> 32:20.667
NOW YOU ON THE OUTSIDE
LOOKING IN.

32:20.670 --> 32:22.991
ALL RIGHT?

32:23.000 --> 32:25.469
TAKE YOUR ASS UP THERE
AND GO KISS SHAWN MOM.

32:28.140 --> 32:29.437
GO.

32:35.980 --> 32:37.869
GOOD SPEECH.

32:37.880 --> 32:39.985
-THANKS.
-YEAH.

32:39.990 --> 32:42.584
-LOOK, COACH...
-YOU DON'T GOTTA APOLOGIZE.

32:42.590 --> 32:44.058
IT'S ALL GOOD.

32:44.060 --> 32:46.051
I RESPECT YOU.

32:46.060 --> 32:47.550
I RESPECT YOUR
POINT OF VIEW.

32:47.560 --> 32:49.449
WE DON'T ALWAYS
HAVE TO AGREE.

32:50.730 --> 32:52.061
OK.

32:52.070 --> 32:53.720
OK?

32:53.730 --> 32:54.891
LOOK. I GOTTA GO.

32:54.900 --> 32:57.961
I WANTED TO--AHEM.

32:57.970 --> 33:00.200
YOUR FATHER AND 1.

33:00.210 --> 33:03.669
WE WERE UP FOR
THE SAME COACHING JOB,

33:03.680 --> 33:07.548
BUT SO WERE
50 OTHER CANDIDATES.

33:07.550 --> 33:11.987
I WAS AT A REALLY BAD
PLACE IN MY LIFE AND...

33:11.990 --> 33:15.051
GETTING THAT JOB
SAVED ME.

33:15.060 --> 33:17.688
SO, I MEAN, DID
I HAVE AN ADVANTAGE

33:17.690 --> 33:18.885
BECAUSE I WAS
IN THE NFL?

33:18.890 --> 33:21.598
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE.

33:21.600 --> 33:25.559
BUT I DIDN'T STEAL THAT
JOB FROM YOUR FATHER.

33:25.570 --> 33:27.629
I EARNED IT.

33:27.630 --> 33:29.268
LOOK. WHY ARE YOU
TELLING ME THIS NOW?

33:31.940 --> 33:34.568
BECAUSE I WANT TO
WIN BACK YOUR TRUST.

33:44.350 --> 33:50.255
PATIENCE: BEEN TRAVELING
THESE WIDE ROADS FOR SO LONG

33:50.260 --> 33:54.584
MY HEART'S BEEN FAR
FROM YOU

33:54.590 --> 34:00.962
10,000 MILES GONE

34:00.970 --> 34:05.259
OH, I WANNA COME NEAR
AND GIVE YOU

34:05.270 --> 34:07.967
EVERY PART OF ME

34:07.970 --> 34:11.873
BUT THERE'S BLOOD
ON MY HANDS

34:11.880 --> 34:15.918
AND MY LIPS AREN'T CLEAN

34:15.920 --> 34:19.641
IN MY DARKNESS I REMEMBER

34:19.650 --> 34:23.688
MOMMA'S WORDS REOCCUR TO ME

34:23.690 --> 34:27.126
"SURRENDER TO THE GOOD LORD"

34:27.130 --> 34:30.054
"AND HE'LL WIPE
YOUR SLATE CLEAN"

34:30.060 --> 34:31.664
PLAYER OF THE YEAR.

34:31.670 --> 34:33.297
PATIENCE: TAKE ME
TO YOUR RIVER

34:33.300 --> 34:34.824
-SHAWN WAS RIGHT ABOUT YOU.
-HOW'S THAT?

34:34.830 --> 34:37.663
PATIENCE: I WANNA GO

34:37.670 --> 34:39.967
HE KNEW YOU'D MAKE
CRENSHAW PROUD.

34:42.710 --> 34:43.905
WHEN HE SAY THAT?

34:43.909 --> 34:45.639
ALL THE TIME.

34:45.650 --> 34:46.799
THAT'S WHY HE WOULD
TELL EVERYBODY

34:46.810 --> 34:48.175
TO LEAVE YOU ALONE.

34:48.179 --> 34:51.342
BECAUSE YOU HAD THE
CHANCE TO BE GREAT.

34:51.350 --> 34:53.114
NO.

34:53.120 --> 34:55.851
NAH, SHAWN WAS
ALWAYS COMING AT ME.

34:55.860 --> 34:57.954
YEAH, BUT

34:57.960 --> 35:00.258
HE WOULDN'T ALLOW
ANYONE ELSE TO.

35:00.260 --> 35:02.854
HE'D ALWAYS TELL US,

35:02.860 --> 35:04.851
"SPENCE GOT SOMEWHERE
BETTER TO BE."

35:04.860 --> 35:06.692
TYRONE: WHAT UP, SPENCE?

35:06.700 --> 35:08.190
YOU RUNNING WITH US
TODAY OR WHAT?

35:08.200 --> 35:12.740
NAH. SPENCER ALWAYS GOT
SOMEWHERE BETTER TO BE.

35:12.740 --> 35:14.208
I'll SEE YOU
AROUND, SPENCE.

35:14.210 --> 35:17.180
PATIENCE: ...FLOW DOWN
THE JORDAN

35:17.180 --> 35:21.344
OH, I WANNA COME NEAR
AND GIVE YOU...

35:21.350 --> 35:24.149
TYRONE: THAT BOY WAS
YOUR GUARDIAN ANGEL.

35:24.150 --> 35:28.018
PATIENCE: BUT THERE'S BLOOD
ON MY HANDS

35:28.020 --> 35:32.230
AND MY LIPS AREN'T CLEAN

35:32.230 --> 35:35.791
TAKE ME TO YOUR RIVER

35:35.800 --> 35:39.896
I WANNA GO

35:44.740 --> 35:47.710
OH, GO ON

35:47.710 --> 35:50.839
TAKE ME TO YOUR RIVER

35:50.840 --> 35:54.674
I WANNA KNOW

36:00.190 --> 36:04.252
I WANNA GO,
WANNA GO, WANNA GO

36:13.430 --> 36:14.727
HEY.

36:14.730 --> 36:16.767
OH, HEY.

36:16.770 --> 36:19.831
UH, WHAT'S THIS?

36:19.840 --> 36:21.808
ME CLIMBING
OUT OF THE HOLE.

36:21.810 --> 36:23.369
YOU'RE GOING
BACK TO SCHOOL.

36:23.380 --> 36:26.509
YEAH. AND I'VE BEEN
THINKING A LOT

36:26.510 --> 36:28.410
ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID.

36:28.420 --> 36:31.276
HOW THERE'S
ALWAYS A WAY BACK.

36:31.280 --> 36:34.887
OH, UM, I WAS
TALKING ABOUT FOOTBALL.

36:34.890 --> 36:36.915
YOU STILL HAVE
A BRIGHT FUTURE, ASHER.

36:36.920 --> 36:39.059
ALL I CARE ABOUT IS
MY FUTURE WITH YOU.

36:41.430 --> 36:42.454
I LOVE YOU.

36:42.460 --> 36:44.189
I'M WITH SPENCER.

36:50.770 --> 36:53.239
MAN: WE CAN TRY AGAIN

36:53.240 --> 36:57.199
OR WE FALL IN
ON OURSELVES

37:02.420 --> 37:05.310
OLIVIA: NICE SPEECH.

37:05.320 --> 37:07.982
HEY, BABY GIRL.
THANK YOU.

37:07.990 --> 37:11.551
I, UH, ESPECIALLY
LIKED THE PART ABOUT

37:11.560 --> 37:13.824
INTEGRITY
AND ACCOUNTABILITY.

37:18.060 --> 37:19.164
OK.

37:19.170 --> 37:22.060
DAD...YOU DIDN'T

37:22.070 --> 37:24.789
HELP JORDAN PASS
HIS DRUG TEST, RIGHT?

37:24.800 --> 37:26.165
A-AND I'M NOT SAYING
YOU DID.

37:26.170 --> 37:28.309
I JUST--
I-I GET IT.

37:28.310 --> 37:30.335
I MEAN, IT'S JORDAN,
IT'S HIS FUTURE,

37:30.340 --> 37:32.149
AND, YOU KNOW,
1 REMEMBER

37:32.150 --> 37:33.470
WHILE I WAS GOING
THROUGH EVERYTHING,

37:33.480 --> 37:34.845
YOU KNOW, HOW
PROTECTIVE YOU WERE--

37:34.850 --> 37:36.909
BABY, YOU GOT IT
ALL WRONG.

37:36.920 --> 37:40.185
I DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH THAT.

37:40.190 --> 37:44.354
UHH. I DIDN'T
THINK SO.

37:44.360 --> 37:45.828
NIGHT, DAD.

37:45.830 --> 37:47.286
GOOD NIGHT.

38:13.620 --> 38:15.156
YOU SHOULDN'T
BE HERE, COOP.

38:15.160 --> 38:17.913
I TOLD YOU.
I WANT IN.

38:17.920 --> 38:19.024
YOU'RE TOO WEAK.

38:19.030 --> 38:21.385
I'M STANDING
RIGHT HERE.

38:21.390 --> 38:23.028
YOU KNOW I CAN'T
JUST LET YOU IN.

38:23.030 --> 38:25.397
SO, DO WHAT
YOU GOTTA DO.

38:25.400 --> 38:26.822
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

38:28.370 --> 38:29.997
LET'S GET IT

39:17.620 --> 39:20.112
WHAT'S UP, SPENCE?

39:42.480 --> 39:44.107
YO, BRANDON...

39:48.110 --> 39:49.544
MISS YOU, BRO.

39:54.220 --> 39:56.018
HOW'S YOUR MOM?

39:58.260 --> 39:59.955
SHE JUST WORRIED
ABOUT ME NOW.

39:59.960 --> 40:02.122
YOU'RE ALL
SHE GOT LEFT.

40:02.130 --> 40:03.950
I'll BE ALL RIGHT.

40:06.100 --> 40:08.660
WHEN IS IT GONNA
STOP, SHAWN?

40:08.670 --> 40:10.263
LEON BRIDGES: BEEN TRAVELING
THESE WIDE ROADS...

40:10.270 --> 40:14.332
IT'S LIKE, BRANDON GETTING
BURIED TOO YOUNG, MAN.

40:14.340 --> 40:16.672
BRIDGES: MY HEART'S
BEEN FAR...

40:16.680 --> 40:18.569
BUT YOU DON'T THINK I
KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO DO?

40:18.580 --> 40:21.402
BRIDGES: 10,000 MILES...

40:21.410 --> 40:24.471
IT AIN'T GOTTA BE
LIKE THAT, MAN.

40:24.480 --> 40:27.188
WHOEVER DID THIS
TO BRANDON,

40:27.190 --> 40:29.284
LET IT GO.

40:29.290 --> 40:32.180
YOU AIN'T
GOTTA RETALIATE.

40:32.190 --> 40:36.024
BRIDGES: BUT THERE'S BLOOD
ON MY HANDS

40:36.030 --> 40:38.499
AND MY LIPS AREN'T CLEAN

40:38.500 --> 40:40.127
TOO LATE.

40:40.130 --> 40:43.498
BRIDGES: IN MY DARKNESS
I REMEMBER

40:43.500 --> 40:47.334
MOMMA'S WORDS
REOCCUR TO ME

40:47.340 --> 40:50.776
"SURRENDER TO THE GOOD LORD"

40:50.780 --> 40:55.001
"AND HE'LL WIPE
YOUR SLATE CLEAN"

40:55.010 --> 40:58.514
CHORUS: TAKE ME
TO YOUR RIVER

40:58.520 --> 41:03.014
I WANNA GO

41:07.190 --> 41:10.194
BRIDGES: GO ON

41:10.200 --> 41:13.397
CHORUS: TAKE ME
