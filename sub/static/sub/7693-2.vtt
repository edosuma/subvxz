( fly buzzing )

00:10.241 --> 00:11.542
WHAT IS THAT?

00:11.542 --> 00:13.784
BREE, RELAX.
IT'S JUST A FLY.

00:13.784 --> 00:16.117
WELL, WHY IS IT
BOTHERING ME

00:16.117 --> 00:18.689
WHEN THE FOUL, RIPE STENCH
OF ADAM IS RIGHT THERE?

00:20.121 --> 00:21.792
LUCKY UNDIES.
NINE DAYS IN A ROW,

00:21.792 --> 00:24.655
AND NO LIGHTNING STRIKES--
THAT'S SCIENCE.

00:24.655 --> 00:27.658
( fly buzzing )

00:27.658 --> 00:30.201
( laughing --
remote chirps )

00:30.201 --> 00:33.264
YOU LOOK RIDICULOUS.

00:33.264 --> 00:36.367
WELL, YEAH, SO WOULD YOU
IF YOU HAD SOME FLYING THING
ATTACKING YOU.

00:36.367 --> 00:38.439
( remote chirps,
buzzing stops )
 WOULD I?

00:38.439 --> 00:39.640
( buzzes )

00:39.640 --> 00:41.342
HOW'D YOU DO THAT?

00:41.342 --> 00:43.074
I TALK TO INSECTS.

00:43.074 --> 00:46.247
THEY CALL ME
THE FLY WHISPERER.

00:46.247 --> 00:48.249
YOU CAN TALK TO FLIES?

00:48.249 --> 00:50.551
ASK HIM WHY
BEES ARE SUCH JERKS.

00:52.583 --> 00:55.626
GUYS, LEO'S
MESSING WITH YOU.

00:55.626 --> 00:57.688
THAT'S MR. DAVENPORT'S
SPY FLY,

00:57.688 --> 00:59.430
HE DESIGNED IT FOR
RECON MISSIONS.

00:59.430 --> 01:01.732
YOU SEE, THE FLY'S HEAD
IS A TINY CAMERA.

01:01.732 --> 01:03.534
LEO'S CONTROLLING
THE ENTIRE THING

01:03.534 --> 01:07.398
WITH A TRACKBALL
ON THIS WATCH.

01:07.398 --> 01:09.640
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU DON'T RUIN?

01:09.640 --> 01:12.243
NOPE.

01:12.243 --> 01:15.075
LEO, I DON'T THINK
MR. DAVENPORT WOULD
APPROVE OF YOU

01:15.075 --> 01:17.448
USING HIS EXPENSIVE
GADGETS AS TOYS.

01:17.448 --> 01:20.111
WELL, THEN, HE SHOULDN'T
HAVE GONE TO ROCK 'N ROLL
FANTASY CAMP.

01:20.111 --> 01:21.752
HELLO! YOU'RE ALMOST FORTY!

01:21.752 --> 01:24.315
YOU CAN'T ROCK,
AND YOU'RE NO ONE'S FANTASY.

01:25.386 --> 01:28.719
CAN I SEE IT?
 BACK OFF, HANDSY.

01:30.221 --> 01:33.564
IT NEEDS TO CHARGE
IN ITS FLY HIVE.

01:33.564 --> 01:34.865
I USED IT ALL NIGHT.

01:34.865 --> 01:38.629
WAIT. YOU SPENT ALL NIGHT
PLAYING WITH THAT STUPID THING?

01:38.629 --> 01:40.231
WELL, HALF THE NIGHT.

01:40.231 --> 01:42.633
I SPENT THE OTHER HALF
EDITING THE FOOTAGE.

01:42.633 --> 01:44.475
WHAT FOOTAGE?

01:44.475 --> 01:46.737
WELL, NOW THAT
YOU'VE ASKED...

01:50.541 --> 01:52.483
I GIVE YOU THE BEST...

01:52.483 --> 01:53.744

02:06.697 --> 02:08.658
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU,
LEO!

02:08.658 --> 02:13.434
HEY, IT'S NOT MY FAULT
YOU SLEEP UGLY.

02:13.434 --> 02:16.637
THE WORLD'S FIRST
BIONIC SUPERHUMANS...

02:16.637 --> 02:18.309
THEY'RE STRONGER THAN US,

02:18.309 --> 02:20.671
FASTER, SMARTER.

02:20.671 --> 02:23.374
THE NEXT GENERATION
OF THE HUMAN RACE IS...

02:23.374 --> 02:25.416

03:02.953 --> 03:04.855
( fly buzzing, Leo laughing )

03:04.855 --> 03:06.687
WOULD YOU CUT IT OUT?!

03:06.687 --> 03:09.189
I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU BROUGHT
DAVENPORT'S FLY TO SCHOOL.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.322
NOW I HAVE TWO LITTLE PESTS
FOLLOWING ME AROUND.

03:13.294 --> 03:16.797
HOW COULD I NOT?
HE'S MY... WING MAN.

03:18.299 --> 03:19.830
HEY, GUYS.

03:19.830 --> 03:22.903
CHASE, HAVE YOU BEEN
STEALING

03:22.903 --> 03:24.505
FROM
FIVE-YEAR-OLD GIRLS AGAIN?

03:26.607 --> 03:28.839
HA HA. IT'S FOR HEALTH CLASS.

03:28.839 --> 03:31.942
EACH OF US HAS TO BABY-SIT
A ROBO-BABY FOR A NIGHT.

03:31.942 --> 03:35.346
( doll crying )
 ARE YOU HUNGRY?

03:35.346 --> 03:36.287
YES, YOU ARE,

03:36.287 --> 03:38.849
MY SNOOGIE-WOOGIE-BOOGIE!

03:41.422 --> 03:44.395
JUST WHEN WE THOUGHT
HE COULDN'T GET ANY CREEPIER.

03:44.395 --> 03:47.758
IT CRIES WHEN
IT'S TIRED OR HUNGRY.

03:47.758 --> 03:49.330
I HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF HIM,

03:49.330 --> 03:51.262
BECAUSE IF I DON'T,
I LOSE A POINT.

03:51.262 --> 03:52.633
WHICH, OF COURSE,

03:52.633 --> 03:54.335
I HAVEN'T.

03:55.606 --> 03:57.968
AND I WON'T,
BECAUSE I HAVE DOWNLOADED

03:57.968 --> 03:59.940
EVERY CHILDCARE BOOK
AVAILABLE.

03:59.940 --> 04:02.673
I EVEN KNOW HOW TO
RESCUE A BABY OUT OF
AN ALLIGATOR'S MOUTH.

04:04.345 --> 04:06.477
HAPPENS MORE OFTEN
THAN YOU THINK.

04:07.778 --> 04:09.880
SO, WHERE'S YOUR BABY?

04:09.880 --> 04:11.752
LOST IT ALREADY?

04:11.752 --> 04:13.884
HA HA. NO.

04:13.884 --> 04:16.656
DO YOU REALLY THINK
I'M THAT IRRESPONSIBLE?

04:16.656 --> 04:18.759
IT'S IN HERE.

04:18.759 --> 04:21.291
I NAMED HIM
"SHUT YOUR CRYHOLE."

04:21.291 --> 04:23.994
THAT WAY,
WHENEVER I SAY HIS NAME,
HE'LL KNOW TO STOP CRYING.

04:23.994 --> 04:26.567
YOU KEEP YOUR BABY
IN A BAG?

04:26.567 --> 04:29.400
YEAH! IT'S SUPER-TOASTY,
BOOKS TO READ IF HE'S BORED,

04:29.400 --> 04:31.842
AND IT'S TOTALLY SAFE.

04:31.842 --> 04:34.305
OH! YOU FOUND MY GUM!

04:37.007 --> 04:38.509
AND A PENNY!

04:40.351 --> 04:42.913
DUDE, YOU ARE TOTALLY
GONNA FAIL THIS ASSIGNMENT.

04:42.913 --> 04:45.356
NO, I'M NOT,
BECAUSE UNLIKE YOU,

04:45.356 --> 04:46.887
I KNOW WHAT A BABY LIKES.

04:46.887 --> 04:49.059
I THINK LIKE A BABY.

04:49.059 --> 04:50.561
YEAH,
HE'S GOT YOU THERE.

04:50.561 --> 04:54.064
OH, YEAH? WELL, IF YOU'RE
SUCH AN EXPERT ON BABIES,

04:54.064 --> 04:57.428
WHY DON'T WE
JUST LET THE SCORES
SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES?

04:57.428 --> 04:58.869
YOU'RE ON.

04:58.869 --> 05:02.503
I'VE GOT A 98.
I'M ONLY TWO POINTS BEHIND.

05:03.634 --> 05:06.006
THAT'S AN 86.

05:06.006 --> 05:07.578
( doll cries )

05:07.578 --> 05:11.812
AW, IT'S OKAY,
"SHUT YOUR CRYHOLE."

05:11.812 --> 05:13.614
( crying continues )
 OKAY, SERIOUSLY,

05:13.614 --> 05:16.587

05:16.587 --> 05:20.020
COME ON, LEO, OR WE'RE GONNA
BE LATE FOR OUR PHYSICS TEST.

05:20.020 --> 05:22.493
PHYSICS TEST?

05:22.493 --> 05:26.397
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.
I WAS SO BUSY WITH THE FLY

BREE...SWEET, LOVING,
CARING BREE...

05:31.802 --> 05:35.506
WONDERFUL, WISE, BEAUTIF--
 WHAT DO YOU WANT, LEO?

05:35.506 --> 05:39.940
I HAVE AN IDEA.
HOW ABOUT YOU WRITE DOWN
THE RIGHT ANSWERS,

05:39.940 --> 05:43.714
AND I'LL COPY OFF YOUR PAPER.
SOUND LIKE A PLAN?

05:43.714 --> 05:48.118
NO WAY, LEO.
I'M NOT HELPING YOU CHEAT.

05:48.118 --> 05:50.120
FINE, I WON'T LOOK
AT YOUR PAPER.

05:50.120 --> 05:55.986

A FATHER COULD LOVE.

ON TIMMY NEWCASTLE?

12:44.895 --> 12:46.466
I THINK I'LL GO TELL HIM.

12:46.466 --> 12:50.040
WHOOPS! I THINK I JUST DID!

12:50.040 --> 12:51.501
GOOD LUCK!

12:51.501 --> 12:53.503
( evil laughter )

12:53.503 --> 12:55.475
PERRY LEFT
THE CHARGING HIVE.

12:58.448 --> 13:00.851
NOW, BREE-- BREE.
THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

13:00.851 --> 13:04.184
IF YOU GIVE THAT TO PERRY,
SHE CAN RECHARGE THE FLY
AND MY LIFE WILL BE OVER,

13:04.184 --> 13:06.086
EVERYONE WILL HATE ME.

13:06.086 --> 13:07.317
THAT'S THE PLAN.

13:12.092 --> 13:14.324
( swarm of flies buzzing )

13:15.926 --> 13:17.527
All: OOH! AAH!

13:21.001 --> 13:24.134
SEE WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU DON'T LET ME
CHEAT OFF YOU?

13:31.541 --> 13:34.384
( flies buzzing )
 HOW AM I GONNA GET
ALL THESE FLIES BACK?

13:34.384 --> 13:37.447
I DON'T KNOW.
AND ALSO, I DON'T CARE.

13:39.319 --> 13:42.893
DOOLEY! YOUR STUPID TOY'S
MESSED UP!

13:42.893 --> 13:45.055
UHH! WHERE DID THESE
COME FROM?

13:45.055 --> 13:48.899
I HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MANY FLIES
SINCE I THOUGHT MY CAT TOOK
A FIVE-DAY NAP.

13:48.899 --> 13:52.132
( flies buzzing )

13:52.132 --> 13:54.204
I'LL OPEN THE DOOR.
 NO!

13:54.204 --> 13:56.236
THEY'RE MY STEP-DAD'S!
I CAN'T LOSE THEM!

13:56.236 --> 13:59.309
THAT DOOR IS OPENING WHETHER
YOU'RE IN THE WAY OR NOT.

13:59.309 --> 14:01.071
I JUST NEED
A RUNNING START.

14:01.071 --> 14:03.273
CAN'T WE JUST TALK THIS OUT
LIKE CIVILIZED--

14:03.273 --> 14:05.075
CHARGE!!!
 AAAAAH!

14:06.947 --> 14:09.479
( shrieking )

14:13.984 --> 14:17.357
BREE, I CAN'T GET
ALL THESE FLIES BACK
WITHOUT YOUR HELP.

14:17.357 --> 14:20.160
NO PROBLEM.
JUST TELL PERRY
YOU CHEATED.

14:20.160 --> 14:23.333
REALLY?
YOU'RE STILL ON THAT?

14:23.333 --> 14:25.635
YEP. LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE STUCK, LEO.

14:27.167 --> 14:30.070
"STUCK." THAT'S IT!

14:33.303 --> 14:35.445
THE BEST WAY TO CATCH A FLY

14:35.445 --> 14:37.307
IS WITH FLYPAPER.

14:37.307 --> 14:40.911
LEO, THAT'LL NEVER WORK.
THEY'RE NOT REAL FLIES.

14:40.911 --> 14:43.883
AAAH! SHARP TURNS!
SHARP TURNS! AAAH!

14:43.883 --> 14:45.315
( crash )
 OHH!
 OOH!

14:46.656 --> 14:49.519
I'M STUCK.

14:49.519 --> 14:51.021
( flies buzzing )

14:51.021 --> 14:52.262
GOT ONE.

14:55.265 --> 14:57.367
LOOK WHAT YOU DID
TO MY BABY!

14:58.298 --> 15:02.232
I HAD TO WRESTLE HIS ARM
FROM A GOLDEN RETRIEVER!

15:02.232 --> 15:06.406
WELL, THANKS TO YOU,
MY BABY'S FACE LOOKS
LIKE CREME BRULEE!

15:06.406 --> 15:08.278
WE'RE BOTH GONNA FAIL,

15:08.278 --> 15:10.340
AND THE ONLY PERSON
YOU HAVE TO BLAME IS YOURSELF

15:10.340 --> 15:11.641
FOR YOUR HIDEOUS-LOOKING
CRYHOLE!

15:11.641 --> 15:14.214
( gasps )
HOW DARE YOU?!

15:14.214 --> 15:17.487
LUCKY FOR YOU HIS EARS
ARE FULL OF MAPLE SYRUP.

15:20.390 --> 15:22.252
( buzzer, doll cries )

15:23.623 --> 15:26.156
THIRTY-SEVEN POINTS--

15:26.156 --> 15:28.428
YOU MONSTER!

15:28.428 --> 15:30.961
IT'S JUST A NUMBER.

15:30.961 --> 15:32.432
MY LITTLE GUY
MAY HAVE THIRTY-SIX,

15:32.432 --> 15:34.334
BUT I'M STILL PROUD OF HIM.

15:34.334 --> 15:35.405
(baby talk)
YES, I AM,
AREN'T I?

15:35.405 --> 15:37.567
YES, I AM,
AREN'T I?

15:37.567 --> 15:39.369
ANSWER ME!!!

15:39.369 --> 15:41.311
WAIT A MINUTE.

15:41.311 --> 15:45.175
IF I TURN MY BABY IN NOW,
I CAN STILL BEAT YOU.

15:47.978 --> 15:50.280
( buzzer, doll cries )

15:50.280 --> 15:52.222
( both screaming )

15:52.222 --> 15:53.423
GET OFF ME!!!

15:55.355 --> 15:59.389
Perry:
HEY, IF ANYBODY CAN HEAR ME,
THERE'S A CROWBAR IN MY PURSE!

15:59.389 --> 16:01.331
( flies buzzing )

16:01.331 --> 16:04.334
JUST CONFESS
AND I CAN HELP YOU
FIX ALL THIS!

16:04.334 --> 16:06.336
YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO STEER THEM ALL.

16:06.336 --> 16:09.539
PLEASE, HAVE
A LITTLE FAITH.

16:09.539 --> 16:11.601
( remote control beeping )

16:11.601 --> 16:14.574
WHAT IS THAT?

16:14.574 --> 16:18.378
"ATTACK MODE ENGAGED.
STUN STINGERS ACTIVATED."

16:18.378 --> 16:20.750
THIS IS GETTING BETTER
BY THE MINUTE.

16:20.750 --> 16:22.312
( loud thudding )

16:25.055 --> 16:26.356
OH, NO.

16:26.356 --> 16:28.418
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

16:28.418 --> 16:30.490
OH. OH. HEY.

16:30.490 --> 16:33.193
UH, DON'T WORRY.
IT SAYS THE STINGS
AREN'T LETHAL.

16:33.193 --> 16:35.325
YOU'LL JUST BE STUNNED
FOR TEN MINUTES.

16:35.325 --> 16:37.467
IN SPAIN THEY CALL THIS
A "SIESTA."

16:39.399 --> 16:41.171
( laughs weakly )

16:41.171 --> 16:43.433
( crying )

16:45.275 --> 16:46.636
EN GARDE!
 AHA!

16:49.609 --> 16:50.710
WAIT!

16:50.710 --> 16:52.482
THERE'S A FLY
ON YOUR HEAD.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.420
( buzzer, doll cries )

17:00.420 --> 17:02.552
ARE YOU GONNA
GET THE FLY OR NOT?

17:02.552 --> 17:05.224
( flies buzzing )

17:06.596 --> 17:08.728
LEO, WHAT'S HAPPENING?

17:08.728 --> 17:11.461
OH YOU KNOW, DESTROYING
PRICELESS INVENTIONS,

17:11.461 --> 17:14.134
UNLEASHED A BIOHAZARD,
HATED BY ALL. TYPICAL TUESDAY.

17:16.266 --> 17:18.468
WHOA! LOOK AT
ALL THOSE FLIES!

17:19.409 --> 17:21.441
MY BABY!

17:23.272 --> 17:24.344
SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING!

17:24.344 --> 17:26.346
CHASE, THROW YOUR BABY UP
TO GET MINE DOWN!

17:26.346 --> 17:29.048
NO WAY!
 BUT IT'S GONNA GET HURT!

17:29.048 --> 17:32.182
HURT? ADAM,
IT'S A PLASTIC DOLL.

17:32.182 --> 17:33.483
( gasps )

17:33.483 --> 17:35.525
THAT IS SO INSENSITIVE.

17:35.525 --> 17:37.487
TO YOU HE'S JUST
A PIECE OF PLASTIC,

17:37.487 --> 17:40.530
BUT TO ME, HE'S BECOME
A LITTLE FAKE PERSON FRIEND

17:40.530 --> 17:43.393
WHO ALMOST NEVER
JUDGES ME.

17:43.393 --> 17:46.096
I WAS SUPPOSED
TO LOOK AFTER HIM,
AND I FAILED.

17:46.096 --> 17:49.199
I FAILED YOU,
MY LITTLE CRYHOLE!

17:49.199 --> 17:51.301
WELL, I DON'T CARE.

17:51.301 --> 17:55.445
I'M GOING TO TURN MY IN,
WHICH MEANS I'M GONNA WIN
AND YOU'RE GONNA LOSE. HA!

17:55.445 --> 17:57.677
YEAH, I GUESS SO.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.549
CONGRATULATIONS,
CHASE.

17:59.549 --> 18:02.312
THANK YOU.
I'M GONNA GO NOW.

18:02.312 --> 18:04.754
( flies buzzing )

18:04.754 --> 18:07.487
I'M GONNA DO IT.

18:07.487 --> 18:09.389
I'M LEAVING.

18:09.389 --> 18:11.591
( whimpering,
sniffling )

18:11.591 --> 18:13.823
OKAY, FINE, I'LL HELP YOU!

18:19.369 --> 18:20.500
( buzzer, doll cries )

18:20.500 --> 18:23.503
THANKS, CHASE.
THAT REALLY MEANT
A LOT TO ME.

18:23.503 --> 18:24.634
UM-HMM.
 ESPECIALLY THE PART

18:24.634 --> 18:27.477
WHERE YOU COMPLETELY
FELL FOR IT!

18:27.477 --> 18:28.578
( laughing )

18:28.578 --> 18:30.480
( buzzer, doll cries )

18:33.343 --> 18:35.685
HELP ME!

18:35.685 --> 18:38.348
ARE YOU READY TO TELL PERRY
YOU CHEATED?

18:38.348 --> 18:40.590
NOT REALLY, NO.

18:40.590 --> 18:43.153
OH, COME ON!
ADAM AND CHASE
WOULD COVER FOR ME.

18:43.153 --> 18:47.427
YEAH, AND THEY ALSO
TURNED THEIR BABIES
INTO BREAKFAST TREATS.

18:47.427 --> 18:49.599
LOOK, I'M YOUR SISTER,

18:49.599 --> 18:51.231
AND IT'S MY JOB
TO CALL YOU OUT

18:51.231 --> 18:53.503
AND HOPE THAT YOU'RE MATURE
ENOUGH TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY.

18:53.503 --> 18:54.904
BUT I'M NOT!

18:56.806 --> 18:59.709
FINE. I'LL TELL PERRY.

18:59.709 --> 19:01.711
SMART MOVE.

19:01.711 --> 19:04.214
I'LL JUST USE MY SUPERSPEED
TO CREATE A VACUUM EFFECT

19:04.214 --> 19:06.346
AND SUCK THE FLIES
BACK INTO THE HIVE.

19:06.346 --> 19:09.419
WHAT ABOUT USING
YOUR BIONICS IN PUBLIC?

19:11.781 --> 19:13.583
I THINK WE'RE GOOD.

19:17.257 --> 19:19.289
( flies buzzing )

19:31.241 --> 19:34.744
WOW. THAT WAS
THE FOURTH-WEIRDEST THING
I'VE SEEN ALL DAY.

19:34.744 --> 19:38.578
SPEAKING OF WHICH, NUMBER THREE
IS STILL OVER THERE

19:38.578 --> 19:41.451
WAITING FOR YOUR CONFESSION.

19:41.451 --> 19:45.915
GREAT. I HAVE TO CONFESS TO
THE WRONG END OF A PANTSUIT.

19:51.591 --> 19:53.223
PRINCIPAL PERRY?

19:53.223 --> 19:54.764
(grunts) WHO IS THAT?

19:54.764 --> 19:57.627
DON'T TRY ANYTHING;
I CAN IDENTIFY YOU
BY YOUR STENCH.

19:59.899 --> 20:02.632
IT'S ME, LEO.
 OOH.

20:02.632 --> 20:04.934
THE ONLY REASON
BREE WAS TALKING
DURING THE TEST

20:04.934 --> 20:07.937
WAS BECAUSE I WAS USING
THE SPY FLY TO CHEAT OFF OF HER.

20:07.937 --> 20:10.240
SHE DIDN'T DESERVE
TO FAIL; I DID.

20:10.240 --> 20:12.542
AW, THAT'S NICE.

20:12.542 --> 20:14.213
I GOT AN ITCH--

20:14.213 --> 20:15.845
UNLESS YOU'RE PLANNIN'
ON SCRATCHIN' IT,

20:15.845 --> 20:17.347
GET ME OFF OF HERE!

20:20.890 --> 20:22.522
( grunting )

20:38.568 --> 20:41.010
ONE, TWO...

20:41.010 --> 20:44.444
AHH! OHH... OOH.

20:44.444 --> 20:47.447
THANKS, DOOLEY.
I OWE YA ONE.

20:47.447 --> 20:49.579
REALLY?
 YEAH--

20:49.579 --> 20:52.922
ONE LONG, HOT TRIP
TO SUMMER SCHOOL!

20:52.922 --> 20:54.424
( laughing )

20:54.424 --> 20:56.986
FORGOT MY EYEBROWS.

20:58.528 --> 21:00.560
MM MM MM.

21:10.340 --> 21:12.402
ADAM,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

21:12.402 --> 21:15.645
I GOT SO LONELY
I HAD TO ADOPT
SIX NEW BABIES.

21:15.645 --> 21:18.478
MEET "CHANGE YOUR OWN DIAPER,"
"STOP STARING AT ME,"

21:18.478 --> 21:20.880
"QUIT WHINING,"
"DON'T BE A BABY,"
"I SAID SHH!"

21:20.880 --> 21:22.952
AND TED.

21:22.952 --> 21:25.515
WHY WOULD YOU GET
SIX BABIES?

21:25.515 --> 21:28.658
(laughs) BECAUSE SEVEN
WOULD JUST BE CRAZY.

21:29.819 --> 21:31.891
ADAM, THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

21:31.891 --> 21:33.663
YOU WANT TO BORROW ONE,
DON'T YOU?

21:35.725 --> 21:36.926
I'LL TAKE TED.
