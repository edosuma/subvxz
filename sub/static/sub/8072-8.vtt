[theme music playing]

00:08.709 --> 00:10.178
Woo.

00:10.211 --> 00:13.647
Thank you, sir,
may I have another?

00:13.681 --> 00:14.548
JACKIE: Hey, guys.

00:14.582 --> 00:16.016
Hey.

00:16.050 --> 00:19.187
I think I found the perfect
creamer for the restaurant.

00:19.220 --> 00:21.489
[moo sound]

00:22.523 --> 00:23.557
What do you think?

00:23.591 --> 00:25.126
I think in the wrong
hands, petty cash

00:25.159 --> 00:27.961
can be a dangerous thing.

00:27.995 --> 00:30.231
No one appreciates my pain.

00:30.264 --> 00:34.835
Which is why you should
not be alone all the time.

00:34.868 --> 00:35.869
No, Roseanne.

00:35.903 --> 00:36.970
What?

00:37.004 --> 00:38.372
You don't even know
what I'm going to say.

00:38.406 --> 00:39.973
You're going to try
to fix me up another one

00:40.007 --> 00:41.142
of Dan's friends.
- See.

00:41.175 --> 00:43.111
That just goes to show
you how wrong you are.

00:43.144 --> 00:45.279
I was going to say something
totally different from that.

00:45.313 --> 00:46.947
What?

00:46.980 --> 00:49.883
Well, now, I forget.

00:49.917 --> 00:53.053
The only thing I
can think about is

00:53.087 --> 00:54.222
this one friend of
Dan's that would

00:54.255 --> 00:56.690
be really perfect for you.
- I'm not looking.

00:56.724 --> 00:58.226
Can we just drop it?

00:58.259 --> 00:59.493
Come on, Nancy.

00:59.527 --> 01:00.961
Just because you haven't
met anybody lately,

01:00.994 --> 01:03.164
doesn't mean you
should just give up.

01:03.197 --> 01:04.865
Yeah, besides,
this friend of Dan's,

01:04.898 --> 01:06.634
I think he is doing
really, really

01:06.667 --> 01:09.203
well, OK, because he
just blew a ton of money

01:09.237 --> 01:11.272
on these hair plugs.

01:11.305 --> 01:13.474
Sounds like a dream, Roseanne.

01:13.507 --> 01:15.343
I think I'll take a pass.

01:15.376 --> 01:16.977
No you won't, because
I told him you're

01:17.010 --> 01:18.078
going to call him this morning.

01:18.112 --> 01:20.281
And I just know you
guys are really--

01:20.314 --> 01:22.516
No.

01:22.550 --> 01:24.752
I'm already seeing someone.

01:24.785 --> 01:29.490
Oh, well, thank god, because
this bald guy is a real loser.

01:29.523 --> 01:32.260
JACKIE: So, come on.

01:32.293 --> 01:33.461
Tell us about the guy.

01:33.494 --> 01:34.695
- Yeah.
- What's his name?

01:34.728 --> 01:35.763
Why don't you tell us?

01:35.796 --> 01:37.097
We're just going to
bug you till you do.

01:37.131 --> 01:38.132
No.
It's too soon.

01:38.166 --> 01:39.767
It's too soon.
- Come on.

01:39.800 --> 01:40.868
Tell us.
Tell us.

01:40.901 --> 01:43.271
Come on, you big, baby.

01:43.304 --> 01:44.238
All right.

01:44.272 --> 01:45.439
Her name is Marla.

01:45.473 --> 01:46.574
I'm seeing a woman.

01:53.514 --> 01:55.483
[laughter]

01:55.516 --> 01:56.317
What?

02:00.788 --> 02:02.756
No, you aren't.

02:02.790 --> 02:03.691
I'm serious.

02:03.724 --> 02:04.525
I'm gay.

02:08.662 --> 02:10.531
You're just screwing
with us, right?

02:10.564 --> 02:11.365
No.

02:14.502 --> 02:15.636
So what do you think?

02:19.072 --> 02:21.842
Well, it's really surprising.

02:21.875 --> 02:23.143
I mean, when did this happen?

02:23.177 --> 02:26.013
Wait a minute.

02:26.046 --> 02:29.383
You and I used to go looking
for guys all the time.

02:29.417 --> 02:32.553
We went to all those
singles dances together.

02:32.586 --> 02:34.955
Singles dances?

02:34.988 --> 02:35.923
I thought we were dating.

02:40.894 --> 02:41.762
Joke.

02:41.795 --> 02:42.763
Joke.

02:42.796 --> 02:46.200
Just kidding.

02:46.234 --> 02:47.668
But I don't get it.

02:47.701 --> 02:49.570
I-- where'd you meet her?

02:49.603 --> 02:51.839
At the cosmetic
counter at Rodbell's.

02:51.872 --> 02:53.241
She does makeovers.

02:53.274 --> 02:54.275
Well, she's
certainly thorough.

03:00.047 --> 03:10.891
So-- did you do it?

03:10.924 --> 03:16.163
Roseanne, you
don't just ask that

03:16.196 --> 03:18.799
right away, for God's sakes.

03:18.832 --> 03:21.068
Why didn't you tell
us about it before?

03:21.101 --> 03:22.202
I don't know.

03:22.236 --> 03:24.004
I was scared.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.739
I didn't know how you'd react.

03:25.773 --> 03:27.541
Well, we'd react the
same way we react when

03:27.575 --> 03:30.077
you tell us anything personal.

03:30.110 --> 03:31.545
We make fun of you
till it gets old.

03:31.579 --> 03:32.380
Then we move on.

03:35.182 --> 03:37.985
I can feel the love.

03:38.018 --> 03:41.322
It's just so strange.

03:41.355 --> 03:43.190
It's so weird.

03:43.223 --> 03:46.860
I mean-- so when did
you start liking women.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.762
I mean, you were
married to Arnie.

03:48.796 --> 03:55.168
Oh, Arnie turned her gay.

03:55.202 --> 04:00.173
Well, sleeping with Arnie
would turn any woman gay.

04:00.207 --> 04:02.443
Some women.

04:02.476 --> 04:05.346
[theme music playing]

04:53.661 --> 04:55.796
JACKIE: Wow, imagine
what it would

04:55.829 --> 04:58.298
be like going through life
without wanting or needing

04:58.332 --> 04:59.299
a man.

04:59.333 --> 05:00.834
What do you think
it's like anyway,

05:00.868 --> 05:02.035
two women living together?

05:02.069 --> 05:03.871
Oh, that's easy.

05:03.904 --> 05:08.275
It's my turn to be
unselfish and giving.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.878
No, you got to be unselfish
and giving yesterday.

05:10.911 --> 05:14.515
Today, you have to be
supportive and nurturing.

05:14.548 --> 05:15.416
Yeah, this could be good.

05:15.449 --> 05:17.250
No ESPN.

05:17.284 --> 05:19.687
Twice the PMS.

05:19.720 --> 05:22.055
I'm afraid I'm going to
feel weird around Nancy now.

05:22.089 --> 05:27.260
I mean, what if she
starts checking me out?

05:27.294 --> 05:28.829
Well, she probably
already has.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.831
Oh, my god.

05:30.864 --> 05:33.100
Well, you said you guys want
to buy swimsuits together.

05:36.470 --> 05:39.206
Oh, relax, Jackie.

05:39.239 --> 05:41.008
She can control herself.

05:41.041 --> 05:43.877
It's not like she's a man.

05:43.911 --> 05:47.080
This is so weird.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.916
Well, you know, she's
still your friend.

05:48.949 --> 05:53.320
She just so happens to be gay.
- What's for lunch?

05:53.353 --> 05:55.923
And who's gay?

05:55.956 --> 05:59.326
Loose meat and none
of your business.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.394
Oh, I probably know anyway.

06:00.428 --> 06:02.663
It's Dr. Summers,
your gynecologist.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.097
My gynecologist is a lesbian?

06:07.868 --> 06:10.337
Hey, she's still
your gynecologist.

06:10.370 --> 06:13.874
She just happens
to be a lesbian.

06:13.907 --> 06:14.808
Chill.

06:14.842 --> 06:16.109
I was just messing
with your head.

06:16.143 --> 06:17.077
So who is it?

06:17.110 --> 06:18.479
No.

06:18.512 --> 06:20.581
Roseanne, come on She's going
to find out about it somehow.

06:20.614 --> 06:22.349
Wouldn't you rather it
came from her mother with

06:22.382 --> 06:24.184
a little explanation?

06:24.217 --> 06:25.986
No, not really.

06:26.019 --> 06:28.656
I hate this.

06:28.689 --> 06:32.960
All right, well, before I tell
you, let me ask you a question.

06:32.993 --> 06:37.364
Do you ever watch Sally Jesse?

06:37.397 --> 06:39.633
Mom, I pretty much
already know about lesbians.

06:39.667 --> 06:43.904
And what I don't, you'd
too embarrassed to tell me.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.172
Yeah, right.

06:45.205 --> 06:50.043
Well, it's Nancy.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.912
Whoa.

06:51.945 --> 06:52.813
How did you find out?

06:52.846 --> 06:54.214
Did she tell you?

06:54.247 --> 06:56.917
No, we saw the
"I'm a big old dyke"

06:56.950 --> 06:59.086
bumper sticker on her car.

07:16.169 --> 07:19.673
I still don't see how we
could have missed it, Roseanne.

07:19.707 --> 07:24.244
How could we not have known
that Nancy is a lesbian.

07:24.277 --> 07:27.481
Well, she doesn't look
like a lesbian, you know.

07:27.515 --> 07:31.084
I mean, lesbians are big
old truck drivers that wear

07:31.118 --> 07:32.452
flannel shirts and faded jeans.

07:50.738 --> 07:52.706
So what do you think, mom?

07:52.740 --> 07:54.341
I picked out the
linoleum myself.

07:54.374 --> 07:55.843
Looks pretty great, huh?

07:55.876 --> 07:57.778
I'm a silent partner.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.213
It shouldn't matter
what I think.

08:00.247 --> 08:01.815
Yeah, thanks, mom.

08:01.849 --> 08:03.383
Oh, don't be so sensitive.

08:03.416 --> 08:05.819
Now, I have some wonderful news.

08:05.853 --> 08:07.688
I found a place to
live in Lanford.

08:11.458 --> 08:14.728
Don't worry, it's no
where near either of you.

08:14.762 --> 08:17.598
Well, why didn't you say so.

08:17.631 --> 08:20.100
We're so happy for you then.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.134
You might have heard of it.

08:21.168 --> 08:24.071
It's called Harvest Glen.

08:24.104 --> 08:26.640
Isn't that a retirement place?

08:26.674 --> 08:29.877
No, they call it
is senior community.

08:29.910 --> 08:31.011
Well, you can't live there.

08:31.044 --> 08:33.146
It's just for old people.
- Wait, Roseanne.

08:33.180 --> 08:34.982
It's mom's decision.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.450
I think we should
support her in it.

08:37.484 --> 08:38.819
Mom, you have my support.

08:38.852 --> 08:39.887
Thank you, Jackie.

08:39.920 --> 08:42.956
Jackie, they tie
old people into chairs

08:42.990 --> 08:45.959
at places like that.

08:45.993 --> 08:49.630
Please don't screw this up.

08:49.663 --> 08:51.765
Harvest Glen is
nothing like that.

08:51.799 --> 08:53.533
It's not a nursing home.

08:53.567 --> 08:55.936
Lots of people my
age live there.

08:55.969 --> 08:58.271
And they have all
kinds of activities,

08:58.305 --> 09:00.307
workshops, golfing, day trips.

09:00.340 --> 09:01.541
It sounds great.

09:01.575 --> 09:04.044
And I assume that there's
some sort of a curfew.

09:04.077 --> 09:05.245
Nobody off the
grounds after what?

09:05.278 --> 09:06.146
5:00?

09:06.179 --> 09:08.916
6:00?

09:08.949 --> 09:10.651
They're having an
open house tomorrow.

09:10.684 --> 09:14.354
And I'd like both of you to come
along and see how nice it is.

09:14.387 --> 09:17.691
OK, but if I see one old
person tied to anything,

09:17.725 --> 09:19.627
I'm leaving.

09:19.660 --> 09:21.595
Bon jour.

09:21.629 --> 09:23.897
Marla, Roseanne, Jackie.

09:23.931 --> 09:24.798
Hi.

09:24.832 --> 09:25.733
Their mom, Bev.

09:25.766 --> 09:26.967
This is Marla.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.402
I just brought her in to
show her my new enterprise.

09:29.436 --> 09:30.303
Wait.

09:30.337 --> 09:32.973
I know you.

09:33.006 --> 09:37.477
Didn't you sell me moisturizer
the other day at Rodbell's?

09:37.510 --> 09:39.412
You know, I
think you're right.

09:39.446 --> 09:41.949
That's exactly how we met.

09:41.982 --> 09:44.017
Yeah, but Nancy
got the free gift.

09:50.390 --> 09:52.760
There was a free gift?

09:52.793 --> 09:56.529
You don't want that give, mom.

09:56.563 --> 10:00.367
It was only available
to certain customers.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.235
And this customer
is satisfied.

10:05.939 --> 10:09.276
Can we-- can-- you want to
check out the bathroom, mom.

10:09.309 --> 10:11.211
I'm sure you're going
to hate the wallpaper we

10:11.244 --> 10:13.213
put up in there.
- You finished the bathroom?

10:13.246 --> 10:14.214
I'm going to see it.
- Oh, yeah.

10:24.758 --> 10:26.760
You know Nancy
is so lucky to have

10:26.794 --> 10:28.796
friends that are so supportive.

10:28.829 --> 10:30.831
Oh, Nancy is so great.

10:30.864 --> 10:31.799
Oh, she is great.

10:31.832 --> 10:32.766
She's great.

10:32.800 --> 10:37.470
And she's-- uh--
very-- really funny.

10:37.504 --> 10:39.673
Hey, listen, you guys don't
have to sell me on Nancy.

10:39.707 --> 10:41.174
I mean, we hit it
off right away.

10:41.208 --> 10:44.311
Well, we're just glad
she's happy, not that she

10:44.344 --> 10:46.446
was unhappy or desperate.

10:46.479 --> 10:52.720
She's-- really very popular.

10:52.753 --> 10:54.922
Oh, yeah, yeah, popular.

10:54.955 --> 10:57.057
She could have her
pick of-- well,

10:57.090 --> 10:58.859
as it turns out-- anybody.

11:10.303 --> 11:12.940
Do all the units have
the same carpeting?

11:12.973 --> 11:13.841
Oh, we just put it in.

11:13.874 --> 11:15.743
We picked a nice, neutral tone.

11:15.776 --> 11:16.777
I hope you like it.

11:16.810 --> 11:18.011
Oh, it's just fine.

11:18.045 --> 11:19.346
I have lots of throw rugs.

11:22.215 --> 11:24.251
I'm going to go check
the laundry room.

11:24.284 --> 11:27.087
Lint traps tell you a
lot about your neighbors.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.056
So what do you think?

11:29.089 --> 11:30.958
I love the place.
Isn't it great, Roseanne?

11:30.991 --> 11:31.992
How soon can we drop her off?

11:34.694 --> 11:35.729
What's this for?

11:35.763 --> 11:38.098
Oh, well, it's a
medical alert button.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.399
There's one in every room.

11:39.432 --> 11:41.601
If there's an emergency, all
you have to do is press it

11:41.634 --> 11:44.004
and an ambulance will
be here immediately.

11:44.037 --> 11:44.972
Immediately, huh?

11:45.005 --> 11:47.007
Roseanne, no.

11:47.040 --> 11:50.277
Oh, and here's something
else that's kind of neat.

11:50.310 --> 11:53.580
This is a motorized lift
chair for our tenants

11:53.613 --> 11:54.915
who have a little
trouble getting

11:54.948 --> 11:56.784
up out of a seated position.

11:56.817 --> 11:59.386
That's not too depressing.

11:59.419 --> 12:02.289
Hey, you get your own chair.

12:02.322 --> 12:05.692
You big baby.

12:05.725 --> 12:08.161
You know, before
Bev gets back,

12:08.195 --> 12:10.530
we want to you to know this
is more than a place for her

12:10.563 --> 12:11.932
to reside.

12:11.965 --> 12:14.534
We want to do everything
we can to take the burden

12:14.567 --> 12:16.236
off you and your sister.

12:16.269 --> 12:19.072
You must have an
awfully large staff.

12:19.106 --> 12:21.574
No, no, what I
mean is, you see,

12:21.608 --> 12:25.412
the price of the condo includes
long-term medical attention.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.114
When it becomes
necessary, your mother

12:27.147 --> 12:30.383
will be automatically
relocated into a bed

12:30.417 --> 12:32.452
in our constant care wing.

12:32.485 --> 12:33.987
What happens to her apartment?

12:34.021 --> 12:35.422
Oh, well, it'll
go back to a pool

12:35.455 --> 12:37.858
to be resold to new residents.

12:37.891 --> 12:39.459
What if she gets better?

12:39.492 --> 12:41.628
Oh, now this is
a long way off.

12:41.661 --> 12:44.597
I mean, obviously your
mom is in great shape.

12:44.631 --> 12:46.633
No, but I mean I
want to know what

12:46.666 --> 12:49.702
happens if she gets better.

12:49.736 --> 12:54.141
They are not young
people, Mrs. Conner.

12:54.174 --> 12:56.609
Wonderful laundry
facility, although it

12:56.643 --> 12:57.777
is a bit of a meat market.

13:00.447 --> 13:04.717
Mom, you better think
about this a little bit.

13:04.751 --> 13:07.420
Nonsense, I think I'm
ready to sign right now.

13:07.454 --> 13:08.989
No, you're not, mom.

13:09.022 --> 13:11.058
You need to think about
it a little bit more.

13:11.091 --> 13:12.826
Mom knows what
she wants, Roseanne.

13:12.860 --> 13:13.726
She does not.

13:13.760 --> 13:14.928
Yes I do.

13:14.962 --> 13:19.566
I hope you're not calling
mom stupid, Roseanne.

13:19.599 --> 13:21.969
What else do you
call paying for a condo

13:22.002 --> 13:25.939
that they take back and medical
care that you might never use?

13:25.973 --> 13:27.908
Mom could get run
over by a bus tomorrow

13:27.941 --> 13:29.276
and they hit the jack pot.

13:29.309 --> 13:32.579
Don't say that, Roseanne.

13:32.612 --> 13:35.782
Mom could lapse into a coma,
live 40 years as a vegetable,

13:35.815 --> 13:36.816
and she cleans up.

13:42.755 --> 13:45.458
I don't think this
is up to either of you.

13:45.492 --> 13:48.495
It's my money and my life.

13:48.528 --> 13:51.398
OK, well, if you want to
go throwing them both away.

13:51.431 --> 13:52.832
I mean, if you're
feeble-minded enough

13:52.866 --> 13:55.435
to want to take this deal, then
maybe you should be in a home.

13:55.468 --> 13:57.938
Well, if you're narrow minded
enough to try to stop me,

13:57.971 --> 14:00.340
maybe you ought to go
home and not come back.

14:00.373 --> 14:01.241
[siren approaching]

14:01.274 --> 14:04.044
Fine.

14:04.077 --> 14:05.979
Well, listen to that.

14:06.013 --> 14:09.549
Sounds like another condo
is ready to open up.

14:09.582 --> 14:12.352
[music playing]

14:16.256 --> 14:19.159
JACKIE: The place is
perfect, Roseanne.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.194
You know how hard it is
for mom to make friends.

14:21.228 --> 14:23.463
There are hundreds
of people there.

14:23.496 --> 14:26.099
It would take her years
to alienate them all.

14:26.133 --> 14:28.801
Oh, you just want
her out of your face?

14:28.835 --> 14:32.205
Well, of course, I do, but I
still think it be good for mom.

14:32.239 --> 14:34.807
Why are you fighting
moving so hard?

14:34.841 --> 14:36.343
Well, how come you
ain't fighting it at all?

14:36.376 --> 14:38.311
Because I think
it's a good idea.

14:38.345 --> 14:39.646
Oh, don't you get it, Jackie?

14:39.679 --> 14:43.116
That would be the last
place mom would ever live.

14:43.150 --> 14:46.219
That's the place we'd have to
go get her stuff after she dies.

14:46.253 --> 14:47.454
Why worry about it now?

14:47.487 --> 14:48.989
It's so for in the future.

14:49.022 --> 14:50.723
We don't know that.

14:50.757 --> 14:52.459
Gosh, she's 63.

14:52.492 --> 14:57.297
She can only get insurance
from Art Linkletter.

14:57.330 --> 15:01.401
Why are you so
freaked out about this?

15:01.434 --> 15:05.272
Because it's just really weird
to be planning mom's death.

15:05.305 --> 15:09.642
We have been planning
her death for years.

15:09.676 --> 15:11.945
Plotting, not planning.

15:11.979 --> 15:12.845
JACKIE: All right.

15:12.879 --> 15:13.746
Fine.

15:13.780 --> 15:14.948
So it's up in our face now.

15:14.982 --> 15:17.150
You knew we'd have to deal
with it sooner or later.

15:17.184 --> 15:18.885
I know, but I just
thought it would be later,

15:18.918 --> 15:22.155
you know, way later, like
when we're more mature.

15:22.189 --> 15:23.690
We are mature--

15:23.723 --> 15:24.591
kind of.

15:24.624 --> 15:26.893
How old do you feel?

15:26.926 --> 15:27.894
I don't know.

15:27.927 --> 15:31.664
Most of the time 30--

15:31.698 --> 15:35.302
12, on a good day 8.

15:35.335 --> 15:40.707
Well, I feel like I'm 16,
with an 18-year-old married

15:40.740 --> 15:44.044
daughter, two
mortgages, and a mother

15:44.077 --> 15:46.479
going into a retirement home.

15:46.513 --> 15:48.881
I wish I was old
enough to drink.

15:48.915 --> 15:52.752
It's not that bad, Roseanne.

15:52.785 --> 15:56.589
I'm 40, Jackie.

15:56.623 --> 15:59.526
This is all just
gone way too fast.

15:59.559 --> 16:01.228
How long till I'm
shuffling towards

16:01.261 --> 16:02.929
that medical alert button?

16:02.962 --> 16:04.797
I'm not going
to listen to this.

16:04.831 --> 16:07.934
You're still young.

16:07.967 --> 16:13.173
Hey, Darlene, do you
think of me as young?

16:13.206 --> 16:15.175
Well, that depends.

16:15.208 --> 16:18.545
I mean, if you mean young as
in vibrant and full of life,

16:18.578 --> 16:20.480
well, I guess I do.

16:20.513 --> 16:22.149
On the other hand, if you
mean young as, you know,

16:22.182 --> 16:24.117
open minded and willing
to accept new ideas,

16:24.151 --> 16:27.454
then I guess you qualify
in that area also.

16:27.487 --> 16:30.057
Best of all, I think of you
as a friend and contemporary.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.200
I must be getting old.

16:40.233 --> 16:42.202
I walked right into that one.

16:48.541 --> 16:50.877
JACKIE: Well, I
guess that it, mom,

16:50.910 --> 16:52.312
unless you want me to
stick around and help

16:52.345 --> 16:54.047
unpack this stuff.

16:54.081 --> 16:59.686
How-- look you went forks,
knives, serving spoons, spoons.

16:59.719 --> 17:00.920
Different.

17:00.953 --> 17:02.989
I'm not afraid of change.

17:06.659 --> 17:07.927
Hey.

17:07.960 --> 17:08.828
Hey.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.163
What are you doing here?

17:10.197 --> 17:13.166
Well, I just thought I'd
stop by and bring mom a gift.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.735
Great, make me look bad.

17:15.768 --> 17:16.703
I'm going to Wal-Mart.

17:16.736 --> 17:17.537
I'll be right back.

17:21.841 --> 17:23.743
Well, here, I
brought this for you.

17:23.776 --> 17:26.813
Well, thank you, Roseanne.

17:26.846 --> 17:31.050
I'd better put it somewhere
where it won't drip.

17:31.084 --> 17:36.256
I'm surprised to see you
considering how you feel.

17:36.289 --> 17:39.025
Well, it's not like I
can stop you or nothing.

17:39.058 --> 17:42.462
But you know, you can still
get out of this whole deal,

17:42.495 --> 17:43.730
you know, if you want.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.932
We could just go to them
and tell them that you're

17:45.965 --> 17:47.500
senile or something.

17:47.534 --> 17:50.803
That's sweet, dear, but I
don't think senility would get

17:50.837 --> 17:53.273
you out of an old folks home.

17:53.306 --> 17:55.275
Well, I just never
want to come in here

17:55.308 --> 17:58.978
and find you acting
like an old person.

17:59.011 --> 18:00.880
You don't have to
worry about that.

18:00.913 --> 18:04.717
I don't feel like an old person.

18:04.751 --> 18:08.821
Well so how old do you feel?

18:08.855 --> 18:10.089
63.

18:10.123 --> 18:12.325
I'm 63.

18:12.359 --> 18:13.726
No, I know that.

18:13.760 --> 18:18.265
But I mean like on the inside,
you know, how old do you feel?

18:18.298 --> 18:20.333
I'm 63.

18:20.367 --> 18:24.937
I feel like a 63-year-old woman.

18:24.971 --> 18:28.541
How nice having this
talk with you mom.

18:28.575 --> 18:32.379
What do you want
me to say, Roseanne?

18:32.412 --> 18:34.581
Well, I want you to say
that you feel like, you know,

18:34.614 --> 18:40.052
16 or 24 or 35, anything but 63.

18:40.086 --> 18:42.255
Well, what's wrong with 63?

18:42.289 --> 18:43.556
Well, it's old.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.362
I don't want you to get old.

18:49.396 --> 18:50.597
I know, dear.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.432
Because you're
just dragging me with

18:52.465 --> 18:54.000
you and I don't like it.

18:58.905 --> 19:01.741
You know, dear,
I don't get older

19:01.774 --> 19:06.045
just to inconvenience you.

19:06.078 --> 19:07.814
Yeah, I know.

19:12.018 --> 19:13.019
I'm old.

19:13.052 --> 19:17.056
Oh, you're not old, dear.

19:17.089 --> 19:19.759
Well, I feel old.

19:19.792 --> 19:21.361
Listen, why can't
you just forget

19:21.394 --> 19:22.462
about all this, you know?

19:22.495 --> 19:24.030
And just go get a
regular apartment.

19:24.063 --> 19:26.399
And then later on,
if you need to,

19:26.433 --> 19:28.835
well, then you could just
move in with Dan and me.

19:28.868 --> 19:29.669
Well, me.

19:32.772 --> 19:34.907
I appreciate the offer, dear.

19:34.941 --> 19:37.810
And I did consider it.

take better care of me.

20:27.927 --> 20:29.962
spending all her
time with Marla,

OK, I'm just going to come out
and tell you this, all right?

20:45.478 --> 20:46.846
OK?

20:46.879 --> 20:50.383
Marla and Nancy are lesbians.

Of course they are.

Any fool could see that.

supposed to walk up and say,

oh, hello, you nice lesbians.
