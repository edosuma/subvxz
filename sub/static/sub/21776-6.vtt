-Return to Jesus and you can return here.
-[Tracy] Are you going to throw my stuff?

00:19.080 --> 00:22.680
Yeah, I don't need it.
I've got all I need.

00:23.120 --> 00:25.400
You've kicked me out of my house,
I don't like you any more.

00:27.200 --> 00:29.480
It's all right.
I'm just going across the square.

00:29.560 --> 00:32.120
I'll just pop back
if I need anything, innit?

00:34.960 --> 00:36.320
I love you.

00:37.280 --> 00:38.400
I love it here.

Not so pure now, am I?

01:22.440 --> 01:24.560
And he ain't a white chocolate God.

01:24.640 --> 01:28.080
He's more a white chocolate,
unemployed child.

01:29.080 --> 01:31.440
Yeah, he is the Milky Bar Kid.

01:31.760 --> 01:35.120
No, my friends chose me
because I am amazing.

01:35.200 --> 01:37.080
Oh, your family don't choose ya.
Oh, no.

01:37.160 --> 01:39.480
My sister is marrying my gay ex-boyfriend.

01:39.560 --> 01:41.600
I did say we were going
to be more than friends.

01:42.120 --> 01:43.960
Talk to her? I tried.

He's gay.

01:45.280 --> 01:47.080
He's gay. He's gay.

01:47.160 --> 01:49.440
Mummy, can you close the blinds
please? Thank you.

01:49.520 --> 01:51.240
Cynthia? He's gay.

01:51.680 --> 01:52.720
He's gay.

01:53.120 --> 01:55.320
Not even a hen night invitation.

[party hooter]

01:59.200 --> 02:02.120
But who wants to go a kiddie
restaurant with Cynthia anyway?

02:02.200 --> 02:03.200
Me.

02:03.280 --> 02:05.440
Because I got a thing or two
planned, you get me?

02:05.520 --> 02:08.920
So here I am. BO in this armpit,
a bloody period in my knickers,

02:09.000 --> 02:12.160
and a best friend
who loves having me here.

02:12.520 --> 02:14.600
Tracey, when you moving in with me?

02:14.920 --> 02:17.240
I told you, I have to live
with mixed-race people

02:17.320 --> 02:18.880
first before I make the full transition.

02:18.960 --> 02:20.640
I've never lived with white people before.

02:20.720 --> 02:21.720
Right...

02:21.800 --> 02:24.240
-I've never heard nothing like that.
-It's a black thing.

02:39.600 --> 02:41.520
Yo, are you the guy? For the job?

02:41.920 --> 02:43.840
Erm, what?

02:43.920 --> 02:45.840
I'm supposed to be talking
to someone.

02:45.920 --> 02:47.360
Oh, Connor Jones.

02:48.120 --> 02:49.520
Jethro, store manager.

02:52.600 --> 02:53.760
Yeah.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.720
I thought you'd be older.

02:56.120 --> 02:59.000
It says on your CV
you were previously a pilot?

02:59.080 --> 03:00.080
My mum done it.

03:00.400 --> 03:02.200
She going to throw me out
if I don't get a job.

03:02.280 --> 03:03.800
I reckon she made up some shit.

03:04.400 --> 03:05.400
Ah.

03:05.760 --> 03:07.840
Look, it's simple
and it's foolproof.

03:07.920 --> 03:11.240
I follow through this, I will prove
to Cynthia that Ronald is gay.

03:11.760 --> 03:15.000
So this is what?
Some private investigator shit?

03:15.320 --> 03:17.000
Cynthia finds out he's gay...

03:17.080 --> 03:18.720
Some people can't handle
the truth, you know?

03:18.800 --> 03:20.800
-I'm going shops, babe, want anything?
-Get tampons.

03:20.880 --> 03:23.480
I use pads actually, tampons
are for whores. Thank you, Aaron.

03:25.040 --> 03:27.960
Cynthia needs to know Ronald's gay,

03:28.040 --> 03:32.040
so we get Ronald to say he's gay,
and, this is crucial,

03:32.560 --> 03:33.720
we record it.

03:33.800 --> 03:36.160
The recording is sent to me
when I'm at the hen night...

03:36.240 --> 03:37.240
You're not invited.

03:37.320 --> 03:40.560
Yeah, I know.
Do you have a fuck I can borrow?

03:40.640 --> 03:42.760
'Cause I've ran out of fucks to give.

03:43.200 --> 03:45.240
I'll speaker phone that shit
to her live and direct,

03:45.320 --> 03:46.400
Ronald saying something like

03:46.480 --> 03:48.840
"Mmm, I love balls,"
or "Ugh, the vagina."

03:48.920 --> 03:51.320
It'll be glorious, she'll
have no choice but to believe.

03:51.400 --> 03:54.600
-Who's going to record it?
-Yeah, erm...

03:54.680 --> 03:58.000
-Someone who might be called Aaron.
-What?

03:58.080 --> 04:00.480
-Yeah, I need to borrow your boyfriend.
-No!

04:00.560 --> 04:02.880
No, no, no. He's my friend as well.
Ain't you my friend, Aaron?

04:02.960 --> 04:06.080
Aaron, please. Please, please. Look,
all you've got to do is look nice,

04:06.160 --> 04:09.200
go there, sweeten him up, he will
take the bait, classic honey trap.

04:09.280 --> 04:11.680

out my man? Aaron--

04:11.760 --> 04:13.960

and lemme think, man.

04:17.600 --> 04:20.560

from 50 years of a marriage

-But what da rass?

Eckhart Tolle says--

04:26.000 --> 04:27.960
No, no, don't go quoting
dead people's abstract shit.

04:28.040 --> 04:29.400
Just do what I told you to do, yeah?

04:29.480 --> 04:32.560
Oh, and if you're going shop, floss
and red top milk, not green, OK?

04:32.640 --> 04:33.680
At least tidy.

04:33.760 --> 04:35.560
Oh, yeah.

04:35.920 --> 04:37.640
Yeah, I will wear these, thank you.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.760
All right, see you.

04:41.120 --> 04:44.800
So what do you think is the most
important thing about customer service?

04:46.320 --> 04:47.480
Being friendly, innit?

04:48.360 --> 04:49.800
What is "friendly"?

04:50.360 --> 04:54.120
Someone's open and accepts you.
Challenges you and that.

04:55.520 --> 04:58.520
Like my girl.
She does those things.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.400
Yeah, but in terms of customer serv--

05:00.480 --> 05:01.920
Hold on, bruvva, let me finish.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.840
You can't have too many friends.

05:04.200 --> 05:05.560
If you've got just one diamond...

05:06.200 --> 05:09.800
You fu-- You treasure that thing,
yeah, for everything it's worth.

05:10.240 --> 05:11.800
You know some big words.

05:12.280 --> 05:14.680
I know 'em but I don't use really 'em.

05:15.600 --> 05:18.320
'Cause the brain might enjoy
breaking 'em down and that but...

05:18.760 --> 05:20.080
The heart,

05:21.000 --> 05:22.680
the heart ain't concerned.

05:23.360 --> 05:25.760
The heart just wants to know
it's safe.

05:27.960 --> 05:29.600
It's door is narrow, innit?

05:29.680 --> 05:33.440
So a tiny little word don't need
to fight its way in.

05:35.800 --> 05:37.320
One sec.

05:41.640 --> 05:42.720
So wh--

05:43.320 --> 05:44.560
So when can you start?

05:46.760 --> 05:48.040

05:48.120 --> 05:49.120

06:16.680 --> 06:18.520
Mum said commercial
food chains were satanic.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Fast food became Cynthia's
forbidden fruit.

06:21.080 --> 06:23.040
And then so this, like,
chicken nugget hen night shit

06:23.120 --> 06:25.160
actually does make some sense.

06:30.120 --> 06:31.160

He, yeah.

06:53.560 --> 06:56.800
Why don't you go home instead
of drinking yourself to paralysis?

06:56.880 --> 07:00.160
Firstly, I'm teetotal,
but that's beside the point.

07:00.240 --> 07:04.880

and I'm the dance, I guess.

07:19.360 --> 07:20.720
I might, yeah.

07:27.080 --> 07:30.120
Are you still with the Lord? I heard you
backslid and fell into pregnancy?

07:30.200 --> 07:31.200
And then into prostitution.

07:31.280 --> 07:33.000
Are you aware that you have
a demonic spirit?

07:33.080 --> 07:35.400
Are you aware that on Thursdays
your mum sucks my dick?

07:35.480 --> 07:38.000

07:38.080 --> 07:40.680
You know how you can, like, block out
negative people from Twitter?

07:41.000 --> 07:43.120
Cynthia can do exactly
that with her brain.

07:43.440 --> 07:46.600
It's like self-hypnosis,
Derren Brown stuff.

07:46.680 --> 07:48.080
Nah, it's true.

07:48.160 --> 07:49.720

I let him beat me in blackjack.

-Right.

It's just a bit loud, can you...

12:06.920 --> 12:08.760
you know...

12:09.480 --> 12:12.360
Esther! The battery is dead on this again.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.360
Have you hand washed
my knickers yet?

12:16.120 --> 12:19.200
Oh, no. She can't put them in the washing
machine because they get bobbles.

12:23.960 --> 12:26.720
-Cand?
-Tracey, I love you. We love you.

12:26.800 --> 12:29.360
But you're driving everyone crazy,
man! You can't stay here.

12:29.440 --> 12:32.600
Can you at least borrow me a pair
of knickers that are not from Primark?

12:39.520 --> 12:41.680
You're not going to make Cynthia
happy, because you know--

12:41.760 --> 12:43.440
I know relationships are bumpy.

12:44.040 --> 12:46.960
Like the rolls on Oompa-Loompa
here's stomach.

12:47.600 --> 12:48.600
Oh, my God.

12:49.360 --> 12:51.920
He doesn't understand a word. Greek.

12:52.920 --> 12:55.840
-You know what?
-How about I tell you what I know,

12:55.920 --> 12:57.360
point by point?

12:57.680 --> 12:59.120
Point A...

12:59.200 --> 13:01.880
You told me to stay away from you.
I stayed away.

13:01.960 --> 13:06.440
So you inviting yourself into my house
on my wedding day is intriguing.

13:06.520 --> 13:09.640
-Get over yourself, yeah?
-Point B...

13:09.720 --> 13:14.200
You have lips the size of a boat.
Two boats that crashed into each other,

13:14.760 --> 13:16.600
killing everyone.

13:17.680 --> 13:20.240
Eh... You know what? I tried.

13:20.320 --> 13:21.440
Point C...

13:21.520 --> 13:25.640
You're obsessed with my love life because
you can't face the mess of your own!

13:26.720 --> 13:27.720
That...

13:28.320 --> 13:31.400
That is... You don't know
anything about...

13:34.240 --> 13:35.600
Oh...

13:36.000 --> 13:37.320
That one pinch?

13:37.640 --> 13:40.360
You picked the first imbecile
that blinked at you

13:40.440 --> 13:43.280
because you're desperate,
pitiful and lost.

13:43.720 --> 13:45.640
He's the very definition of a waste man.

13:45.720 --> 13:47.360
You'll be the first waste woman!

13:48.080 --> 13:50.000
See you at the wedding!

13:54.560 --> 13:57.040
-Sorry I didn't go back.
-That's all right.

13:57.400 --> 13:59.440
-I know you would if you could.
-Yeah.

13:59.520 --> 14:02.560
I'm really proud.
Mandy must be well happy.

14:02.640 --> 14:03.880
She cried.

14:03.960 --> 14:05.840
Then bought half IKEA.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.480
Can...can we talk?

14:10.560 --> 14:12.520
Fuck, I love this girl.

14:17.240 --> 14:20.040
Before you say anything,
I've seen the bags...

14:20.600 --> 14:22.200
I've already cut you a key.

14:23.120 --> 14:25.480
And I got you these, panty liners.

14:25.840 --> 14:27.480
For your, eh...

14:31.360 --> 14:32.920
The keys are in there.

14:34.200 --> 14:35.600
Come here!

14:36.200 --> 14:37.760
This is just the start!

14:42.600 --> 14:44.120
I don't think I love you.

[children playing outside]

14:47.680 --> 14:49.800
Did...did you hear me?

14:52.520 --> 14:55.000
I just need a couple of minutes to,
uh...

14:58.920 --> 15:01.280
I-I don't understand.
Are you going to go or am I?

15:01.840 --> 15:03.560
Well, yeah. It's, er...

15:03.640 --> 15:05.280
It's your house, so...

15:05.640 --> 15:06.720
I'll go.

15:13.480 --> 15:14.520
Sorry.

15:15.640 --> 15:17.960
I've had problems with this
in the past, though...

15:18.040 --> 15:20.320
-Can I just confirm...
-I get it.

15:20.400 --> 15:22.840
You're leaving me, I know.

15:22.920 --> 15:25.680
OK. That's great.

15:35.960 --> 15:38.400
I've got nothing to say. Sorry.

[store music playing]

15:51.960 --> 15:53.280
Ah.

16:00.120 --> 16:01.160
Connor?

16:01.240 --> 16:04.120
This isn't exactly store policy.

16:06.120 --> 16:08.400
I think, maybe you should go home.

16:11.880 --> 16:13.960
[indistinct chatter]

I said a gazelle!

Got to be delicate
like a graceful swan.

I don't want hard hands
or hefty hands.

[dog barks]

16:37.920 --> 16:39.640
Be very careful what you say.

16:39.720 --> 16:43.040
Our cycles are synchronised.
I know that you are on your period.

16:43.120 --> 16:44.160
I am, too.

16:44.800 --> 16:48.080
But that is no excuse
to permanently break family ties,

16:48.160 --> 16:50.360
because once the blood runs dry...

16:51.200 --> 16:54.480
Those ties cannot be unbroken.

16:54.880 --> 16:57.520
-Yeah?
-You're on your period, too?

16:57.600 --> 16:59.320
-The honeymoon...
-Mmm.

16:59.400 --> 17:01.560

the perfect cover-up to stick it

-in your bum tonight, then?
-OK, yeah...

-Get out of my limousine!
-It is not a limousine!

It's a white car.
They're different things.

-This is my white car! My car!

-Ignore her. Don't let her...

It's my special limousine
ride on my special day,

17:22.400 --> 17:25.360

Yay, we're having fun and smiling...

It's almost 12.

Now you're earning, do you want
to go halvsies on a cabinet?

17:36.320 --> 17:39.200
Connor, if you're going to be late
for work, you should call 'em.

17:39.760 --> 17:43.760
The only company I'm currently
employed by is loneliness.

be the worst day of my life so far.

[background choir singing]

19:26.520 --> 19:27.960
...for who I was...

19:29.680 --> 19:32.600
And when you fall in love, you...

19:33.000 --> 19:34.760
lose control of who you
want to be...

19:36.240 --> 19:38.000
and what you want to be seen as.

19:38.640 --> 19:40.240

whenever you interact with people...
