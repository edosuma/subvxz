He's the manager of Club Echo.
Low-level dealer.

13:47.940 --> 13:50.310
He sends Ella a text
last night at 12:30.

13:50.350 --> 13:51.580
"I'll get you
the intro you want.

13:51.610 --> 13:53.520
Meet me at Echo.
We'll go from there."

13:53.550 --> 13:56.250
- For now, we're assuming that
intro was with Alex's source,

13:56.290 --> 13:57.590
- the distributor.
- Mm-hmm.

13:57.620 --> 13:59.990
- So, Ella gets to Club Echo
around 1:00 a.m.

14:00.020 --> 14:02.660
Witnesses put her and Alex at
the after party at 2:00 a.m.

14:02.690 --> 14:04.190
Jay saw her at 2:30.

14:04.230 --> 14:07.100
And she was in the alleyway
around 3:00.

14:07.130 --> 14:08.630
Not a wide window.

14:08.660 --> 14:10.670
- Hell, I'm thinking something
went wrong at the party

14:10.700 --> 14:13.170
between Ella, Alex,
and the distributor.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.440
So let's go back to Echo,
talk to this guy Alex.

14:15.470 --> 14:17.910
Work his ass.
Figure out who his supplier is.

14:17.940 --> 14:21.950
- Sarge, I know Alex.
- I met him through Camila.

14:21.980 --> 14:26.650
So, uh, let me work him.
Make an undercover buy.

14:28.520 --> 14:30.950
- Okay.
- You're taking Upton.

14:30.990 --> 14:32.320
- All right.

14:34.090 --> 14:35.360
- Adam.

14:39.100 --> 14:41.460
Listen, when you meet Woods...

14:41.500 --> 14:43.230
- Right.
- Just give him what he wants.

14:43.270 --> 14:45.230
- Wait, wait...
you want me to give him

14:45.270 --> 14:46.670
the tape of you
taking the money?

14:46.700 --> 14:48.100
- Yes.
- Boss, I don't...

14:48.140 --> 14:51.010
- How many times
you want me to tell you?

14:51.040 --> 14:53.140
- Whatever you want, Sarge.

14:53.180 --> 14:54.710
Is there anything else
you want me to know?

14:54.740 --> 14:56.080
- Yeah.

14:56.110 --> 14:57.450
I put in papers for Atwater

14:57.480 --> 14:59.980
so he's next in line
for detective, not you.

15:00.020 --> 15:01.550
Maybe you can use that.

15:07.460 --> 15:10.290
- You want us to voucher that
for you?

15:10.330 --> 15:12.130
- Nah, I'll take care of it.

15:12.160 --> 15:14.560
Honestly, I can handle it, boss.

15:14.600 --> 15:16.530
- That 20K is still missing,
huh?

15:16.570 --> 15:20.600
- Yeah, I checked the inventory
logs and ERPS this morning.

15:20.640 --> 15:24.040
- So what prompted this new,
enlightened worldview?

15:24.070 --> 15:28.110
- Anger.
- Voight screwed me over.

15:28.140 --> 15:29.680
Told me I was next
in line for detective.

15:29.710 --> 15:33.320
Found out this morning that he
passed me over for my partner.

15:34.580 --> 15:37.150
Told me straight up
I was next in line.

15:37.190 --> 15:40.120
And he passes me over
for Atwater?

15:40.160 --> 15:42.690
Didn't even give me a heads up.

15:42.730 --> 15:47.260
So the way I see it,
I don't owe him a thing.

You're welcome

16:38.380 --> 16:41.480
- I don't judge, Ryan.
- Or label.

16:41.520 --> 16:42.490

16:42.520 --> 16:44.190
- Yeah.

16:44.220 --> 16:46.360

16:46.390 --> 16:47.620
I might stop by later.

16:47.660 --> 16:50.260
Um, yo, I came by

16:52.530 --> 16:55.760

16:58.470 --> 17:00.070
- You know Camila better.

17:02.410 --> 17:05.440
Oh, huh, she didn't tell you?

17:07.410 --> 17:09.109
- She sells, too.

17:09.150 --> 17:10.650
And, I'm just guessing,

17:10.680 --> 17:12.750
she'll probably give
you a better deal,

17:12.780 --> 17:17.119
since you're
sleeping together and all.

17:17.150 --> 17:18.550
- Look, man,
I know what Camila does,

17:18.589 --> 17:20.119
but I don't like to mix
business with pleasure.

17:20.160 --> 17:22.490
I think it makes things messy.

17:22.530 --> 17:24.530
So this is more than
just recreational.

17:24.560 --> 17:26.260
- Yeah, I'm looking to buy
some big product.

17:26.300 --> 17:29.230
I got a lot of eager customers
who want quality stuff.

17:29.270 --> 17:31.170
- We have eager customers,
actually.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.670
We're in this together.

17:32.700 --> 17:33.870
- What kind of weight
you thinking?

17:33.900 --> 17:36.140
- Quarter key.

17:36.170 --> 17:38.710
- I don't have that
kind of weight with me.

17:38.740 --> 17:40.840
I can get it.

17:40.880 --> 17:42.450
Nine grand.

17:42.480 --> 17:43.810

don't do me like that.

17:43.850 --> 17:47.480

the right number.

that Camila was dealing?

18:01.200 --> 18:02.700
We're gonna talk about this,

- No, I didn't know,
but I'm not surprised.

18:04.530 --> 18:05.830
That's why I've been
working her.

18:05.870 --> 18:08.570
- You're not working her, Jay.
- You're dating her.

18:08.600 --> 18:09.840
And you got her on paper now.

18:09.870 --> 18:12.710
You screwing her
is a fire-able offense.

in all this?

18:14.340 --> 18:15.580
What, are you gonna lie
to the Feds next?

18:15.610 --> 18:17.610
- My relationship

18:17.650 --> 18:18.880
It got us the buy with Alex,

18:18.910 --> 18:20.680
who's gonna lead us
to the shooter.

18:20.720 --> 18:24.250

18:24.290 --> 18:25.690
What are you doing?

18:25.720 --> 18:28.190
- I'm fine.
- I'm fine, all right?

18:28.220 --> 18:29.490
And I can figure this out.

18:29.530 --> 18:30.890
Let's let Alex take us

18:30.930 --> 18:32.430
who might be good
for the murder.

18:32.460 --> 18:33.730
In the meantime,
I'll talk to Camila,

18:33.760 --> 18:35.800
and I'll see what she knows.

18:38.300 --> 18:39.770

to Voight about this.

18:39.800 --> 18:41.770

18:44.370 --> 18:47.910
Give me a few hours.
Please.

♪

18:59.620 --> 19:00.820

1:00 p.m. tomorrow, which means

19:01.860 --> 19:03.890
he needs to buy a quarter key
from his supplier.

19:03.930 --> 19:05.560
- All right, and we already
got him hooked up.

19:05.590 --> 19:06.630
We got a wire on his cell
and his burner phone.

19:06.660 --> 19:07.830
- GPS tracker on his car too.

19:07.860 --> 19:09.500
- So if this guy moves,
we'll know it.

19:09.530 --> 19:10.800
Hopefully we track him
to his source.

19:10.830 --> 19:12.240
We can bust them both.

19:12.270 --> 19:13.940

on top of him until then.

19:13.970 --> 19:16.240
He moves.
We move.

19:16.270 --> 19:19.240
Hey, where's Jay?

19:19.280 --> 19:21.440

Sarge.

19:52.880 --> 19:55.680
she was undercover DEA.

19:56.750 --> 20:00.280
I think she was
working Veil too.

you gotta tell me, please.

20:13.630 --> 20:17.600
Maybe I can help you.

afford this place, all right?

20:25.570 --> 20:28.310
I knew some people
who were selling coke,

20:28.340 --> 20:29.610
so I started dealing.

20:29.650 --> 20:35.350
Just a little, here and there.
Just to make rent.

20:35.380 --> 20:37.990
I'm going to jail, aren't I?

20:38.020 --> 20:40.660
- No. No, not for selling
an eight ball here or there.

20:40.690 --> 20:42.020
Absolutely not.

20:42.060 --> 20:44.960
But if you know
something about that woman,

20:44.990 --> 20:46.960
that is something
completely different.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.470

anything about that.

I would've called the cops.

20:51.870 --> 20:53.440

so worried right now?

She was probably taking names.

20:59.510 --> 21:01.310

than staying here, all right?

39:39.630 --> 39:44.130
I just hope there's a way out.

40:06.090 --> 40:08.160
- Doesn't matter.

40:08.190 --> 40:10.960
- Does to me.

40:12.930 --> 40:14.630
- Jay.

40:19.730 --> 40:23.510
You got lucky.
Wallace confessed.

40:23.540 --> 40:25.110
You're off the hook
for the murder.

40:27.710 --> 40:29.780
- But you will be charged with
felony drug distribution.

40:29.810 --> 40:32.710
And more than likely,
accessory to murder.

40:34.850 --> 40:39.750
However, if you cooperate,

40:39.790 --> 40:42.890
I can probably convince them
to look the other way on that.

40:42.920 --> 40:45.560
And help you out
with that drug charge.

40:45.590 --> 40:47.530
What do you mean "cooperate"?

40:47.560 --> 40:50.730
- Just keep
your mouth shut about Jay.

40:50.770 --> 40:54.840
He's a guy that came
into your bar, asked questions.

40:54.870 --> 40:56.640
The night of the murder,

40:56.670 --> 40:58.610
you were at a party
with a bunch of your friends.

40:58.640 --> 41:01.510
One of them was Ryan.

41:01.540 --> 41:03.750
Later,
you found out he was a cop.

41:03.780 --> 41:06.850
No sex.
No back room.

41:09.780 --> 41:12.590
- What, like I never
even knew him?

41:12.620 --> 41:15.990
- You didn't.

41:16.020 --> 41:21.600
You do that, I'll give you
a chance to have a life.

41:21.630 --> 41:26.770
You don't, I'll bury you.

41:34.180 --> 41:36.840
- I won't say a word.

41:40.650 --> 41:43.220
Like hell if I didn't know him.

41:45.190 --> 41:49.160
The person you know,
that's the lie.
