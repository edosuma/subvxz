13:25.505 --> 13:26.871
We're here to listen.

13:28.507 --> 13:30.241
Well, go on then, sugar cube.

13:30.243 --> 13:32.576
We're not going to
judge you, darling.

13:32.578 --> 13:34.845
You'll feel so much better once
you get it off your chest!

13:34.847 --> 13:40.184
[deep breaths in and out]

13:40.186 --> 13:45.656
Come on. Whatever it is. You
can tell us. We're best friends!

13:47.059 --> 13:54.198
Friends, friends,
friends. Tell, tell, tell.

13:54.200 --> 14:01.772
Friends, friends,
friends. Tell, tell, tell.

14:01.774 --> 14:05.743
OK! OK! You win!

14:05.745 --> 14:07.645
SHINING ARMOR AND CADANCE
ARE GOING TO HAVE A--

14:07.647 --> 14:09.780
... an awesome weekend
with the best little sister

14:09.782 --> 14:12.183
in all of Equestria!

14:12.185 --> 14:16.053
[giggles] Hi, everypony.

14:16.055 --> 14:17.688
[sighs heavily]

14:21.693 --> 14:24.128
Shining Armor!
Cadance! You're early!

14:24.130 --> 14:25.730
I thought something had come up

14:25.732 --> 14:27.598
and you weren't going to
make it until Saturday!

14:27.600 --> 14:30.668
So did we. Turned out we
weren't needed in Maretonia

14:30.670 --> 14:31.969
until next week.

14:31.971 --> 14:34.004
And the summit we were
supposed to attend today

14:34.006 --> 14:36.040
had to be
rescheduled so...

14:36.042 --> 14:38.642
we got here even
sooner than planned.

14:38.644 --> 14:40.845
Surprise!

14:40.847 --> 14:43.114
It's wonderful to
see you all again.

14:43.116 --> 14:47.017
[happy chatter]

14:47.019 --> 14:50.755
I'm so glad you're here. I
have a big surprise for you!

14:50.757 --> 14:51.956
Oh, yeah?

14:55.827 --> 15:02.166
[chatting excitedly]

15:02.168 --> 15:04.135
Lucky we came
when we did, huh?

15:04.137 --> 15:07.905
I'm guessing you saw the scroll
we sent to Mr. and Mrs. Cake.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.940
Hey, I'm impressed you've
been able to keep our secret

15:09.942 --> 15:12.176
So you're gonna
tell Twilight now?

15:13.845 --> 15:17.982
[chatting excitedly]

15:17.984 --> 15:20.151
You're going to have to wait
just a little bit longer.

15:20.153 --> 15:21.886
We have something
special planned.

15:21.888 --> 15:24.889
It'll be worth it, I promise.

15:24.891 --> 15:26.223
It'd better be.

15:30.729 --> 15:33.597
So do ya think Shining
Armor liked his surprise?

15:33.599 --> 15:36.000
Didn't you see him? He
couldn't stop raving about it!

15:44.609 --> 15:47.011
Where did Shining Armor and
Cadance say they'd meet us?

15:47.013 --> 15:48.846
I'm starving.

15:48.848 --> 15:51.916
I wish they'd waited
to walk over with us,

15:51.918 --> 15:54.185
but they said they had something
to take care of first.

15:54.187 --> 15:56.854
They're going to have a lot
more to take care of soon.

15:56.856 --> 15:57.788
What?

15:58.723 --> 15:59.824
Nothing!

16:04.763 --> 16:07.965
That's odd. Usually
they're quite punctual.

16:07.967 --> 16:12.136
Ughhh, I need a hayburger
in my belly right now.

16:13.038 --> 16:14.238
What's this?

16:16.908 --> 16:17.842
[gasp]

16:17.844 --> 16:21.712
A scavenger hunt! Shining Armor
used to set these up for me

16:21.714 --> 16:23.647
when I was a filly.

16:23.649 --> 16:26.684
At the end, there was always
a big prize like a new book,

16:26.686 --> 16:28.085
or several new books, or--

16:28.087 --> 16:30.020
We get the picture!
You like books!

16:31.690 --> 16:32.957
So what's the first clue?

16:32.959 --> 16:35.659
I hope it's something
about eating lunch.

16:35.661 --> 16:37.127
"You've got a scroll,
you're on a roll.

16:37.129 --> 16:39.730
Why don't you take a peek, where
young ones spend their week?

16:39.732 --> 16:41.665
A piece of paper will
continue this caper."

16:43.935 --> 16:45.169
I've got it!

16:45.171 --> 16:47.872
"Where the young ones
spend their week!"

16:47.874 --> 16:49.940
I'm not quite followin'...

16:49.942 --> 16:51.742
[clanging bell]

16:51.744 --> 16:53.944
It's the Ponyville Schoolhouse!

16:53.946 --> 16:56.146
Good enough for me! Now
where's the next clue?

16:56.148 --> 16:59.817
[sniffing]

17:01.086 --> 17:02.987
Ah-choo!

17:02.989 --> 17:07.825
EXTRA! EXTRA! Get your Ponyville
News! Read it in the paper!

17:07.827 --> 17:10.027
EXTRA! EXTRA! Get
your Ponyville...

17:10.029 --> 17:12.663
"A piece of paper, will
continue this caper".

17:12.665 --> 17:14.098
It's in the Foal Free Press!

17:19.738 --> 17:22.840
Ooh! Look at that dress
Mayor Mare is wearing

17:22.842 --> 17:26.076
in the social report.
Why, it's stunning!

17:26.078 --> 17:28.679
Uh, didn't you make
that, Rarity?

17:28.681 --> 17:30.581
Yes. What is your point?

17:30.583 --> 17:32.583
FOCUS, EVERYPONY!

17:32.585 --> 17:34.585
You know, there's
really no time limit

17:34.587 --> 17:36.120
on these scavenger
hunts, Pinkie.

17:36.122 --> 17:38.789
AHA! There!

17:38.791 --> 17:41.592
"Though this hall
is rather small,

17:41.594 --> 17:43.861
in it you'll find
files of all kinds.

17:43.863 --> 17:47.231
Take a look on the back, of the
birth certificate of Applejack!"

17:48.867 --> 17:50.868
I don't like where
this is goin'.

17:57.142 --> 17:59.743
[galloping hooves]

18:08.687 --> 18:09.820
Baby! A ROYAL BAA---

18:09.822 --> 18:12.022
Ahem!

18:12.024 --> 18:14.091
Does anypony know where the
birth certificates are kept?

18:14.093 --> 18:16.961
Ooo! I do! I do! Go down that
hall, then you take a left,

18:16.963 --> 18:19.163
and then a right, then another
right, then a slight left,

18:19.165 --> 18:21.031
then it's the third
door from the right.

18:21.033 --> 18:25.102
Wow, Pinkie. I never knew you
knew so much about Town Hall.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.904
There's a lot of
things I know...

18:26.906 --> 18:28.739
that you don't know I know!

18:36.848 --> 18:41.185
Oh, you're so
cute![giggling and cooing]

18:41.187 --> 18:45.055
"This next place is where,
you can buy a table or chair.

18:45.057 --> 18:48.759
Or some comfy beds to
rest little heads."

18:51.896 --> 18:55.132
Gah! Really? None of you?

18:55.134 --> 18:59.637
It's obviously the furniture
store! Go in, go in, go in!

18:59.639 --> 19:00.671
I don't know...

19:00.673 --> 19:02.740
AHHHH! Fine.

19:02.742 --> 19:06.043
[crashing]

19:10.115 --> 19:13.050
Wow. You're scary good
at this, Pinkie Pie.

19:13.052 --> 19:14.952
"It seems we've saved
the best for last,

19:14.954 --> 19:16.720
we hope that you
have had a blast.

19:16.722 --> 19:18.055
Now it's time to take a break,

19:18.057 --> 19:19.823
where you can get
a slice of cake!"

19:19.825 --> 19:21.025
Sugarcube Corner!

19:21.960 --> 19:23.627
That was an easy one.

19:24.763 --> 19:26.930
[bell jingles]

19:26.932 --> 19:31.869
Surprise! Twily! Did you
like the scavenger hunt?

19:31.871 --> 19:36.006
Just like old times, except
even better because this time

19:36.008 --> 19:38.108
I got to share it
with my best friends.

19:40.645 --> 19:42.780
There's just one thing
missing, isn't there?

19:42.782 --> 19:43.981
What's that?

19:43.983 --> 19:46.050
The book prize at the end!

19:46.052 --> 19:48.852
[chuckle] There's still a prize.

19:48.854 --> 19:50.988
But it's a little
different this time.

19:50.990 --> 19:53.590
Oh. I don't understand.

19:53.592 --> 19:58.228
All the places we sent you
today had something in common.

19:59.631 --> 20:01.665
First we went to
the schoolhouse...

20:04.002 --> 20:06.136
...and then we read
the Foal Free Press.

20:08.206 --> 20:11.608
After that we found Applejack's
birth certificate...

20:11.610 --> 20:14.144
...and then the last
clue was under a crib...

20:14.146 --> 20:21.018
Hmm. School, foal, birth
certificate, and crib...

20:23.722 --> 20:26.156
[gasps] Can it
be? Are you two...

20:27.225 --> 20:29.827
WE'RE HAVING A BABY!

20:32.697 --> 20:38.068
A baby, Twilight!
It's a baby! Woo hoo!

20:38.070 --> 20:41.105
You mean... I'm
going to be an aunt?

20:41.107 --> 20:44.875
♪

20:44.877 --> 20:47.811
This is the best prize ever!

20:47.813 --> 20:51.715
[laughter]

20:51.717 --> 20:53.851
Ooh, I love you guys.

20:53.853 --> 20:56.253
And I can't wait to
meet your little foal!

20:56.255 --> 20:58.055
Neither can we.

20:58.057 --> 21:01.792
[excited chatter]

21:01.794 --> 21:04.728
I DID IT! I DID IT!
I DID IT! I DID IT!

21:04.730 --> 21:05.262
[pop]

21:06.765 --> 21:07.798
Go, Pinkie.

21:08.700 --> 21:16.940
[happy chatter]

21:16.942 --> 21:20.611
You did it, Pinkie Pie!
You kept it a surprise.

21:20.613 --> 21:23.113
Thank you. Was it much trouble?

21:23.115 --> 21:25.182
Piece o' cake!
