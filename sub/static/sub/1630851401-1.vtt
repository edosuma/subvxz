00:23.880 --> 00:26.040
<i>Truth. I'm like you.</i>

00:26.120 --> 00:28.880
<i>Afraid of the future,</i>
<i>because of the past.</i>

00:28.960 --> 00:31.080
Hope in the face of difficulty.

00:32.200 --> 00:35.400
<i>This has been</i>
<i>a decade like no other.</i>

00:35.480 --> 00:38.560
<i>A world filled with hope</i>
<i>for better days.</i>

00:38.640 --> 00:41.960
<i>People promised change.</i>
<i>A better tomorrow.</i>

00:42.040 --> 00:45.520
<i>A world connected</i>
<i>and improving like never before.</i>

00:47.440 --> 00:49.400
<i>Instead, it came apart.</i>

00:52.280 --> 00:56.440
<i>From small places in the outskirts,</i>
<i>to cities and countries,</i>

00:56.520 --> 00:59.600
<i>forces that divide grow stronger.</i>

00:59.680 --> 01:01.360
Very fine people on both sides.

01:02.360 --> 01:07.440
<i>Fear of losing everything we love</i>
<i>forces us make wrong choices.</i>

01:07.520 --> 01:08.520
<i>Terrible choices.</i>

01:15.720 --> 01:16.880
<i>I'm scared.</i>

01:17.960 --> 01:20.280
<i>I wish you could help me.</i>

01:21.600 --> 01:25.400
<i>Why... What's happening?</i>

01:26.440 --> 01:27.680
<i>Don't!</i>

01:27.760 --> 01:28.760
<i>Don't shoot!</i>

04:03.520 --> 04:04.840
Are we there yet?

04:04.920 --> 04:08.680
-We're getting closer.
-But it's taking forever.

04:08.760 --> 04:12.080
It requires some effort to get
to the nicest place in Norway.

04:12.960 --> 04:18.720
-That's not what Uncle Bjørnar said.
-He tries to be funny, but he fails.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.920
You're lucky you have me.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.520
A dad who's actually
the funniest guy in the world.

04:24.600 --> 04:26.800
-You always say that.
-Because it's true.

04:32.240 --> 04:33.880
This is gonna be great.

05:44.320 --> 05:45.360
<i>What do you think?</i>

05:46.160 --> 05:47.400
<i>Think it'll be good?</i>

05:48.120 --> 05:50.600
-I hope so.
-My good girl.

05:52.080 --> 05:54.480
This is going to be great. I promise.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.800
It's still the boonies.

05:59.040 --> 06:00.200
Yeah, maybe.

06:02.280 --> 06:04.280
-Shall we take a look?
-Yeah.

06:17.920 --> 06:20.160
-Yeah.
-Nice boonies.

06:20.240 --> 06:23.200
Very nice boonies this time.

06:24.040 --> 06:28.520
I think it's my turn
to pick a bedroom first.

06:28.600 --> 06:30.520
I'm just gonna do it.

06:32.640 --> 06:34.120
Sleep tight, sweetie.

06:35.280 --> 06:37.080
Can you go to bed too?

06:41.840 --> 06:44.680
Come. Come here.

07:13.280 --> 07:14.640
My stomach hurts.

07:15.480 --> 07:16.840
You know what?

07:17.400 --> 07:20.600
All the kids here
will want to be friends with you.

07:20.680 --> 07:22.560
You're such a sweet and kind girl.

07:22.640 --> 07:24.680
And this is the last time
we're doing this.

07:24.760 --> 07:25.960
No more moving.

07:28.560 --> 07:31.880
And since it's such a small town,
I'm never far away.

07:31.960 --> 07:35.200
-Just take your watch, text me...
-I know. I'll text you.

07:35.280 --> 07:37.120
And I'll be there.

07:39.120 --> 07:40.240
Come here.

07:40.800 --> 07:42.120
I'm so proud of you.

07:47.360 --> 07:48.800
We'll do something fun tonight.

07:48.880 --> 07:50.760
-Bake brownies.
-Brownies?

07:51.520 --> 07:52.800
Sounds good.

07:59.240 --> 08:02.440
-Hi, this is Asgeir.
<i>-Hi, it's me.</i>

08:02.520 --> 08:04.280
<i>We have a little situation here.</i>

08:04.360 --> 08:06.040
Want me to come to the station?

08:06.120 --> 08:08.600
<i>-Meet us at the refugee center.</i>
-Okay.

08:08.680 --> 08:11.240
<i>We're on our way there.</i>
<i>I've sent you the address.</i>

08:11.320 --> 08:12.320
Thanks.

08:56.640 --> 08:59.560
Hi. Asgeir Eng.
I'm new down at the police station.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.480
I haven't gotten my badge yet, but...

09:01.560 --> 09:05.080
I asked the chief to come in person.

09:05.160 --> 09:07.320
Yes, he's on his way.

09:08.800 --> 09:10.040
That's probably him.

09:23.640 --> 09:24.800
Hi, Mona.

09:24.880 --> 09:26.120
Welcome.

09:26.200 --> 09:28.800
-Thank you.
-Straight to work. This is Gunnar.

09:28.880 --> 09:29.840
-Hi, Gunnar.
-Hi.

09:29.920 --> 09:32.200
-Asgeir.
-Gunnar. Nice to meet you.

09:32.280 --> 09:37.080
-Right. This is less nice, though.
-No, this is bloody vandalism.

09:37.160 --> 09:40.000
-We've had stuff like this before.
-This is arson.

09:40.640 --> 09:41.880
Arson?

09:41.960 --> 09:44.160
There's 32 people
sleeping in this house.

09:44.920 --> 09:45.880
Look.

09:48.240 --> 09:51.760
We should be careful
using words like "arson."

09:51.840 --> 09:54.520
Words can be misleading.

09:54.600 --> 09:56.400
-They set fire to it.
-Yes.

09:57.400 --> 10:01.240
But they graffitied the walls too.
They didn't mean for it to burn down.

10:02.520 --> 10:06.560
-There are kids sleeping in there.
-Yes, of course.

10:08.560 --> 10:11.480
Do you know if anyone saw anything?
Heard anything?

10:13.280 --> 10:17.240
You know, where we come from,

10:17.320 --> 10:19.240
police doesn't help us.

10:20.160 --> 10:23.840
I understand.
But I can assure you it's safe.

10:23.920 --> 10:26.960
Safe? Look at the wall.

10:27.680 --> 10:29.840
They tried
to set fire on this place.

10:30.560 --> 10:32.480
I mean it's safe to talk to us.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.040
I really understand your concern.

10:35.120 --> 10:37.200
This is terrible.
You have kids here.

10:37.280 --> 10:39.960
But we're gonna solve this.
We're gonna take these people.

10:40.040 --> 10:43.600
We're gonna keep you guys safe.
I promise. Okay?

10:45.600 --> 10:48.680
Will you take it from here, Gunnar?
You can come with me.

10:50.520 --> 10:51.920
Hey, listen.

10:53.080 --> 10:54.560
Is that it?

10:54.640 --> 10:56.800
Now we're just going
to find whoever did this.

10:56.880 --> 11:01.000
If you don't punish these people,
I'll have to do something myself.

11:01.080 --> 11:02.880
You're not going to do anything.

11:02.960 --> 11:07.080
Leave this to us.
We'll take care of it.

11:07.160 --> 11:08.880
Okay? Calm down.

11:09.760 --> 11:10.840
We'll take care of it.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.600
We're gonna take these people.
You're safe.

11:13.680 --> 11:15.600
-I'm driving with you.
-Okay.

11:20.800 --> 11:22.920
Got a text from the office.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.600
Someone's posted a picture
of the fire-damaged wall

11:26.680 --> 11:28.880
on what I call antisocial media.

11:29.680 --> 11:31.560
If journalists get a hold of those,

11:31.640 --> 11:34.000
they're going to make
some scandalous headline.

11:34.080 --> 11:38.440
They'll want me to say that
someone's gonna get thrown in jail.

11:38.520 --> 11:41.400
This here is just common vandalism.

11:41.480 --> 11:43.560
Teenagers. And then my...

11:44.720 --> 11:47.000
They're so bloody predictable.

11:47.880 --> 11:48.840
Hi, Svein.

11:48.920 --> 11:52.480
I was just saying how someone
has to be thrown in jail for this.

11:52.560 --> 11:55.880
And if you write about this now,
it's going to be you.

11:57.160 --> 12:00.920
We're on top of this. I'll let you
know when everything's sorted.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.160
<i>-Sounds good.</i>
-Right.

12:03.920 --> 12:06.480
Around here you have to flush
when you've been on the can

12:06.560 --> 12:10.120
if you don't want your shit spread
all over the local paper.

12:11.040 --> 12:12.800
I see. I'll keep that in mind.

12:15.760 --> 12:18.520
It was actually my mother
who started the damn thing.

12:18.600 --> 12:22.440
Yeah, she was Norway's
second female newspaper editor.

12:23.520 --> 12:25.760
-People didn't like that.
-Right.

12:26.560 --> 12:28.600
Now it's the refugee center
they don't like.

12:28.680 --> 12:30.840
It's human nature.

12:30.920 --> 12:33.600
Xenophobia.
A fear of everything that's new.

12:33.680 --> 12:35.720
But they'll come around.
Like with my mother.

12:35.800 --> 12:38.120
She became a local hero.

12:42.080 --> 12:49.200
Someone high up called and said
I had to accept your transfer.

12:49.280 --> 12:51.320
Are you some sort of super-cop?

12:53.600 --> 12:55.480
We're glad to have you on our team.

12:55.560 --> 12:57.000
A super-cop.

12:59.520 --> 13:03.800
-Should I just drive straight ahead?
-Yes, there'll be a sign. Trollheim.

13:03.880 --> 13:07.080
The best tourist experience
in Norway.

13:08.800 --> 13:11.960
Two brothers inherited
a bankrupt farm from their father.

13:12.040 --> 13:16.240
The poor guy killed himself.

13:16.320 --> 13:19.520
But they turned it around and made
a successful business out of it.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.960
Vestvik, the clothing brand,
that's them.

13:22.040 --> 13:23.640
-They're the Vestvik guys?
-Yeah.

13:23.720 --> 13:27.240
And they've got climbing
and lots of other stuff too.

13:27.320 --> 13:30.960
It's the best thing that's happened
to this town in many years.

13:39.600 --> 13:42.120
-It's nice, right?
-Sure.

13:42.200 --> 13:44.200
Finally decided
to join me up the wall?

13:44.280 --> 13:49.000
No, no. We have a new hero
at the station.

13:49.080 --> 13:50.520
-This is Asgeir.
-Hi.

13:50.600 --> 13:53.240
I'm showing him
the marvels of Vestvik.

13:53.320 --> 13:55.760
-This is our place.
-Not bad.

13:55.840 --> 13:59.320
This is Bjørn, the big brother,
and the little one, Ole.

13:59.400 --> 14:00.400
The runt.

14:00.480 --> 14:03.160
These guys are the pride of town.

14:04.360 --> 14:06.600
And this is Ragna.
She's from Eastern Norway.

14:06.680 --> 14:11.160
She's a catholic cook who drives
a motorbike, am I right?

14:11.240 --> 14:13.520
I guess so.

14:13.600 --> 14:16.640
And now I hear you're expanding?

14:16.720 --> 14:19.760
Yes, we're building three more cabins
and another warehouse.

14:19.840 --> 14:22.520
I take it your clothes sales
are going great.

14:22.600 --> 14:25.440
No, but we need a place to keep
all the clothes we don't sell.

14:25.520 --> 14:27.120
He's quick-witted.

14:27.640 --> 14:30.400
So how many people
do you have working here now?

14:30.480 --> 14:35.160
11, 12 people here, and then
there's about 70 at the factory.

14:35.240 --> 14:37.040
-About 70?
-Yeah.

14:37.120 --> 14:38.680
Well, there you have it.

14:38.760 --> 14:42.360
Anyway, there's been some vandalism
at the refugee center.

14:42.440 --> 14:44.200
Oh, for fuck's sake.

14:44.280 --> 14:47.880
Someone set fire to a garbage can
that stood against the wall.

14:47.960 --> 14:49.400
It was dangerous.

14:49.480 --> 14:52.600
Mona is talking about arson.

14:53.840 --> 14:56.120
We took care of it
so neatly last time,

14:56.200 --> 14:57.840
so if you could check...

14:57.920 --> 14:59.720
Yeah, of course.

14:59.800 --> 15:03.320
I understand something's happened
there before?

15:03.400 --> 15:05.200
Yeah, windows have been broken.

15:05.280 --> 15:08.440
I've got young guys here
who couldn't even finish high school.

15:08.520 --> 15:12.040
And some of them think that
the refugees are what's in the way

15:12.120 --> 15:14.840
of them fulfilling
their vast potential.

15:14.920 --> 15:17.480
But we manage
to make decent folks out of them.

15:17.560 --> 15:19.480
That's no excuse, of course, but...

15:19.560 --> 15:22.640
No, but it tells you how easy
it is to find out who did it.

15:22.720 --> 15:26.760
Easy is good. Great.
We have to get to the station.

15:26.840 --> 15:29.520
-That's a good idea.
-Give me a call.

15:30.040 --> 15:32.000
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

15:33.560 --> 15:35.280
Fucking hell.

15:37.760 --> 15:39.800
She's a great gal, but be careful.

15:39.880 --> 15:44.200
She broke the nose
of a guy who felt her up.

15:46.360 --> 15:50.320
Don't worry about that. I'm not
looking for anyone at the moment.

15:50.400 --> 15:53.440
It just looked like
you were checking her out.

16:24.360 --> 16:26.000
-Thanks for lending me this.
-Sure.

16:27.040 --> 16:28.520
Do you have more of his books?

16:29.840 --> 16:33.520
You read so fast I don't have time
to find new books for you.

16:34.040 --> 16:36.320
-Did you like it?
-I loved it.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.240
-But it's really dark.
-Yeah.

16:38.320 --> 16:41.400
-Have you seen the movie?
-Yeah.

16:41.480 --> 16:45.240
-But the book was better.
-Really? Why?

16:45.320 --> 16:48.000
You kind of understand more,
you know.

16:55.600 --> 16:56.800
Morning.

16:56.880 --> 16:58.080
Who's that?

16:58.160 --> 17:00.520
Some Germans.
They came two days ago.

17:18.480 --> 17:21.520
Stuff like this could ruin
everything you try to build here.

17:21.600 --> 17:24.440
-Yeah, I know.
-I can help out more.

17:24.520 --> 17:28.240
And you will,
but we have to discuss it first.

17:28.320 --> 17:30.200
He's already waiting in the car.

17:34.240 --> 17:35.240
Hi, Sigrid.

17:36.760 --> 17:40.560
-Bjørn. I heard you needed some help?
-No, Stein. You need help.

17:40.640 --> 17:42.680
Come, let's take a walk.

17:43.880 --> 17:45.000
Out of everyone here,

17:45.080 --> 17:47.920
only two others are stupid enough
to pull something like this.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.440
And they worked late
with my brother last night.

17:50.520 --> 17:52.280
-And you were ratted out.
-It's not me.

17:52.360 --> 17:55.440
Those you've told know
how fucking wrong it is.

17:55.520 --> 17:58.120
-Your father will take you home.
-No, you can't...

17:58.200 --> 18:00.960
I've already called him. He's here.

18:01.800 --> 18:04.600
It's going to be okay.
Get in the car.

18:04.680 --> 18:07.560
You think you can just accuse my son
of something like this?

18:07.640 --> 18:10.440
It's not the first time he's been
up there, and you know it.

18:10.520 --> 18:12.920
Did that lady
at the refugee center say he did it?

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
Just because I'm opposed
to the center, she's targeting Stein?

18:16.080 --> 18:18.120
Calm down.
She's not targeting anyone.

18:18.200 --> 18:20.440
Yes, she is. Because of my views.

18:20.520 --> 18:22.960
Because I've been explicit
about my opinions.

18:23.040 --> 18:24.760
It's still a free country.

18:24.840 --> 18:27.880
If he gives her an apology,
I can get her to not press charges.

18:27.960 --> 18:30.840
But he has to go to the station,
and you'll go with him.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
He's not going to apologize.

18:34.560 --> 18:36.400
He's not going to admit to anything.

18:36.480 --> 18:38.560
This doesn't have to split our town.

18:38.640 --> 18:41.160
And you'll set a good example
for your son for a change.

18:41.240 --> 18:44.640
Are you telling me
how to raise my son now?

18:44.720 --> 18:47.320
You're the one who raised
an arsonist, not me.

18:48.320 --> 18:52.200
He will confess,
or he won't be allowed back here.

18:52.280 --> 18:55.080
And remember,
anything you do to your boy,

18:55.160 --> 18:56.760
I'll do to you tenfold.

18:56.840 --> 18:59.920
I know you, and I know your ex.

19:11.680 --> 19:13.760
Do you know how much they enjoy this?

19:15.040 --> 19:17.280
That my son was caught.

19:23.240 --> 19:24.920
I'm sorry, Dad. It was...

19:45.000 --> 19:47.640
Hi. Couldn't sleep?

19:47.720 --> 19:49.040
We forgot to hug.

19:49.120 --> 19:51.920
We didn't, but you can have
as many hugs as you want.

19:53.440 --> 19:54.760
Did you have a bad dream?

19:59.640 --> 20:01.600
Can you help me
sort out this dollhouse?

20:01.680 --> 20:04.280
It's just chaos when I do it alone.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.280
Dinosaurs in the kitchen.

20:08.600 --> 20:10.520
What was Mom's job?

20:12.840 --> 20:14.120
Mom?

20:15.360 --> 20:16.640
Why do you ask that now?

20:17.240 --> 20:20.000
-Someone in my class asked me.
-Okay.

20:22.200 --> 20:23.800
And what did you say?

20:25.120 --> 20:27.080
I said she's in heaven.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.320
Yeah.

20:34.520 --> 20:38.480
Mom was a lawyer. Don't you remember?

20:40.800 --> 20:42.080
It's a great job.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.200
Where you help people and stuff.

20:46.160 --> 20:48.680
It's super-good.
You should be proud of Mom.

20:51.600 --> 20:52.920
<i>Are you scared?</i>

21:22.080 --> 21:24.000
-Hello?
<i>-Sorry if I woke you.</i>

21:24.080 --> 21:27.200
<i>Something's happened.</i>
<i>We need you up in the woods.</i>

21:27.280 --> 21:28.680
<i>Just get in the car.</i>

21:49.080 --> 21:52.040
Good, you found your way.
He's down here.

21:53.440 --> 21:55.240
A tourist found him and called it in.

21:55.320 --> 21:56.680
It looks like an accident,

21:56.760 --> 21:58.920
but the technicians
found blood on the path,

21:59.000 --> 22:02.480
so they say he's probably
been dragged over here

22:02.560 --> 22:05.400
and dumped to make it
look like an accident.

22:23.360 --> 22:25.880
Last night, Bjørn called and said

22:25.960 --> 22:28.960
the boy who set fire
to the refugee center was Stein Vang.

22:30.160 --> 22:32.360
Stein Vang is the boy
lying right there.

22:34.520 --> 22:36.120
Do they know the cause of death?

22:36.200 --> 22:39.760
They've found marks on his neck
and clear signs of a struggle.

22:39.840 --> 22:41.960
And after he was dead,

22:42.040 --> 22:45.240
someone crushed his skull
repeatedly with a rock.

22:45.320 --> 22:47.800
So there was massive rage involved.

22:48.680 --> 22:52.040
If it's an act of revenge
or something...

22:54.760 --> 22:56.680
then all hell will break loose.

23:05.800 --> 23:07.400
FOR ACTION AGAINST REFUGEE CENTER

23:07.480 --> 23:10.280
MANY DON'T DARE TO SPEAK OUT

23:10.360 --> 23:12.040
CRIMINAL THREATS

23:17.800 --> 23:21.640
Something like this can ruin
a place like ours forever.

23:21.720 --> 23:24.240
We've never had
a murder here, you know.

23:24.320 --> 23:29.600
I think it will be even more ruined
if we don't catch whoever did it.

23:29.680 --> 23:32.480
-Yes.
-So we should just get to it.

23:32.560 --> 23:34.560
You've probably investigated
a few homicides?

23:35.200 --> 23:37.120
No, I haven't.

23:37.760 --> 23:40.760
-That makes two of us.
-Yeah.

23:40.840 --> 23:46.880
I was hoping the black holes
in your messy CV

23:46.960 --> 23:49.320
were your secret life
as Sherlock Holmes.

23:50.320 --> 23:53.240
I guess we'll just have
to do this by the book.

23:53.320 --> 23:54.920
Talk to his friends and family.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.360
Yes. He lives
with his father. He's...

23:58.440 --> 24:01.200
He's a lawyer, but he...

24:02.160 --> 24:04.600
He's a man who speaks
without thinking.

24:04.680 --> 24:05.760
Okay.

24:07.960 --> 24:09.360
What kind of cop were you?

24:13.160 --> 24:14.320
Just the boring kind.

24:17.160 --> 24:21.760
Half your file is classified,
so it can't have been that boring.

24:25.160 --> 24:27.440
No, I'll still hope
you're Sherlock Holmes.

24:28.440 --> 24:29.720
I can be Watson.

24:46.520 --> 24:49.960
I fucked up. I'm done here,
and you know that too.

24:50.680 --> 24:52.400
We need new identities.

24:52.480 --> 24:54.280
And we'll move every year.

24:55.600 --> 24:58.080
He won't give up until you're dead.

24:58.160 --> 25:00.160
And he doesn't give a shit
about the kid.

25:10.760 --> 25:14.560
This is just like building cars.
A lunch-box factory.

25:14.640 --> 25:17.080
Henry Ford.
He invented the belt carousel.

25:17.160 --> 25:20.200
Everyone in the factory
each doing their part of the job.

25:20.280 --> 25:22.000
That's an assembly line.

25:22.080 --> 25:24.840
A belt carousel is that thing
they have at the airport.

25:24.920 --> 25:28.600
-Mr. Continental.
-Well, you know.

25:28.680 --> 25:31.280
Mr. Uncle Asshole here is right.

25:33.720 --> 25:37.240
-I'm off.
-Look at her.

25:37.320 --> 25:39.880
Here, read this one.
<i>The Name of the Rose</i>. It's good.

25:39.960 --> 25:41.760
-And important.
-Thanks.

25:41.840 --> 25:44.440
And remember what I told you.
Who to stay away from.

25:46.680 --> 25:48.640
Bjørn, she's a big girl now.

25:48.720 --> 25:52.200
-She can take care of herself.
-Yes, she's really big.

25:55.440 --> 25:59.160
-Yes.
<i>-Hi, we've found Stein. He's dead</i>.

25:59.240 --> 26:03.240
<i>-Can you come down here?</i>
-Yes, of course. I'll be right there.

26:08.720 --> 26:10.760
Is this the new guy?
Give me a smile.

26:10.840 --> 26:13.320
-You'll be in the paper.
-Leave him alone.

26:13.400 --> 26:15.440
POLICE STATION

26:15.520 --> 26:17.960
I hear you've blocked
the road at Fossdal.

26:18.040 --> 26:20.920
-There's lots of cars...
-Don't write anything until we...

26:21.000 --> 26:22.280
Until what?

26:22.800 --> 26:24.440
I know who drives that car.

26:24.520 --> 26:27.160
Listen. Wait here outside, okay?

26:27.840 --> 26:30.560
If Kjetil Vang is in there,
I need to know what's going on.

26:30.640 --> 26:31.680
Listen.

26:32.560 --> 26:34.200
If you start speculating,

26:34.280 --> 26:37.600
you risk ruining everything
you love about this town.

26:45.040 --> 26:47.280
You can come with me, Asgeir.

26:51.840 --> 26:52.840
Yes.

26:56.120 --> 26:57.480
Let's see.

27:03.800 --> 27:04.800
Coffee.

27:08.320 --> 27:11.520
This is Asgeir Eng
from the Oslo police.

27:11.600 --> 27:13.880
-He's here to assist us.
-Hi.

27:16.560 --> 27:17.680
How did he die?

27:21.000 --> 27:24.800
I told you those refugee fuckers
are dangerous.

27:26.960 --> 27:31.600
Nobody knows
who killed Stein. Not yet.

27:32.400 --> 27:33.560
How did they know?

27:34.360 --> 27:36.600
Bjørn accused him, and now he's dead.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.960
Who told those fucking monkeys?

27:42.040 --> 27:44.400
Like he said,
we don't have any suspects yet.

27:45.360 --> 27:47.360
Somebody outed Stein to them.

27:48.080 --> 27:49.200
And now he's dead.

27:54.800 --> 27:55.960
Look who's here.

27:57.280 --> 27:58.960
What is that boy doing here?

27:59.040 --> 28:00.080
I'll be back.

28:06.840 --> 28:08.720
I...

28:09.880 --> 28:13.920
I sent Stein home with his dad,
and as suspected, he ran away.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.080
His buddy here, John,
met him afterwards.

28:18.000 --> 28:23.520
Stein asked John to help him get out
his frustrations over the refugees.

28:24.200 --> 28:26.960
I've told John to give you
an honest testimony.

28:27.040 --> 28:30.040
-Tell you everything.
-That's great, John.

28:30.120 --> 28:33.280
John can wait for me
in the conference room.

28:33.360 --> 28:35.280
-I'll be right there.
-Come with me.

28:35.880 --> 28:37.880
I shouldn't have sent him away.

28:37.960 --> 28:40.200
I should have looked after him.

28:40.280 --> 28:41.760
Don't think like that.

28:43.200 --> 28:44.800
You're a good man, Bjørn.

28:52.960 --> 28:57.280
So, did you and Stein talk
about the refugee center?

28:57.360 --> 29:00.840
-Did he say anything at all?
-Shouldn't you question the refugees?

29:02.520 --> 29:04.960
They come from active war zones,
you know.

29:05.880 --> 29:08.600
My son was killed
because of false accusations.

29:09.240 --> 29:10.800
Fucking PC shit.

29:12.520 --> 29:18.840
You have expressed some of your own
opinions in the papers and stuff.

29:19.600 --> 29:23.400
You wanted to start up Pegida,
but then you didn't.

29:23.480 --> 29:25.200
Why did you decide against it?

29:26.440 --> 29:27.720
You know nothing.

29:29.880 --> 29:31.600
I've worked hard...

29:33.040 --> 29:34.920
for this community.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.440
Tried to protect it.

29:40.600 --> 29:42.080
This...

29:43.280 --> 29:46.720
I can't imagine how devastating
this must be for you.

29:46.800 --> 29:49.800
It's the worst thing
that can happen to a father.

29:58.240 --> 30:01.000
<i>Write down the name Kjetil Vang.</i>

30:02.360 --> 30:05.280
<i>Look it up in all the registers</i>
<i>I don't have access to anymore.</i>

30:05.360 --> 30:07.280
<i>Does this have</i>
<i>to do with the murder?</i>

30:07.360 --> 30:09.160
<i>I just have a bad feeling about this.</i>

30:09.240 --> 30:13.000
Something's not right,
and that Kjetil is no good.

30:13.920 --> 30:15.080
Okay.

30:15.640 --> 30:17.080
How's Michelle?

30:17.160 --> 30:19.520
<i>She's good. She's happy.</i>

30:19.600 --> 30:22.360
-Give her a hug from her uncle.
<i>-Will do.</i>

30:22.440 --> 30:25.200
And just send me everything
you can find, okay?

30:25.280 --> 30:27.160
Thanks again for all your help.

30:34.240 --> 30:36.480
<i>-You wanted to talk to me?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

30:39.840 --> 30:40.760
Come.

30:45.320 --> 30:49.680
I know that you
and Stein were pretty close.

30:50.320 --> 30:53.360
He was your boyfriend, wasn't he?

30:58.520 --> 31:00.840
-You can't tell Dad.
-I won't.

31:02.280 --> 31:05.200
-Did Kjetil know you were together?
-No.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.920
I didn't mean anything by it.

31:12.200 --> 31:13.680
I didn't want to be there.

31:15.280 --> 31:16.440
Where?

31:22.440 --> 31:26.240
Stein brought me along with him
in the car when he...

31:26.320 --> 31:30.640
When set the fire and graffitied.
But I didn't know he would do it.

31:30.720 --> 31:33.120
He just wanted to scare them.

31:33.200 --> 31:35.320
-Did you stay in the car?
-Yes.

31:36.120 --> 31:37.560
I didn't know.

31:37.640 --> 31:39.280
And now he's just...

31:41.040 --> 31:44.400
-Now he's been killed.
-You didn't do anything.

31:45.400 --> 31:46.560
Right?

31:47.160 --> 31:48.480
And you're not like that.

31:48.560 --> 31:52.080
I know it, your dad knows it,
and your uncle knows it.

31:56.960 --> 31:59.240
I don't know what to tell Dad.

32:01.200 --> 32:04.600
I'll help you. Okay?

32:10.320 --> 32:11.920
<i>What do you care for?</i>

32:12.000 --> 32:15.800
<i>A friend? A daughter? A son?</i>

32:15.880 --> 32:17.800
<i>What would you do to protect them?</i>

32:18.600 --> 32:20.240
<i>Would you do what is right,</i>

32:20.320 --> 32:22.880
<i>even if it feels wrong</i>
<i>to the ones you love?</i>

32:23.880 --> 32:27.520
<i>God gave us a vast potential</i>
<i>for love and respect.</i>

32:27.600 --> 32:29.800
<i>But some deny this gift.</i>

32:29.880 --> 32:31.440
<i>Defy this gift.</i>

32:32.720 --> 32:35.800
<i>People are killed</i>
<i>because they want our future.</i>

32:35.880 --> 32:40.040
<i>But due to heroes working</i>
<i>in silence, they will never get it.</i>

32:42.320 --> 32:43.800
Hi. Yes.

32:45.200 --> 32:47.720
I'll do it myself,
and it's going to work.

33:15.920 --> 33:17.520
<i>-Why am I here? Why?</i>
<i>-Calm down.</i>

33:17.600 --> 33:18.800
<i>No, no, no.</i>

33:18.880 --> 33:22.960
Why should I calm down? No! Stop!

33:23.040 --> 33:25.920
We've found our guy.
Someone sent us a tip.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.840
We found a bag with
Stein's belongings in his closet.

33:28.920 --> 33:31.680
And the technicians found
his boot prints at the crime scene.

33:31.760 --> 33:33.320
Where did the tip come from?

33:33.400 --> 33:36.840
An English-speaking woman said
he was out all night yesterday.

33:36.920 --> 33:40.240
Probably someone from the center,
but she didn't give her name.

33:40.320 --> 33:43.120
How convenient.
Things solving themselves.

33:43.200 --> 33:44.920
Yeah, I guess so.

33:48.600 --> 33:49.920
This is bullshit!

33:50.000 --> 33:51.280
Be careful with him.

33:53.200 --> 33:57.480
The suspect is tied
to both the scene and the victim,

33:57.560 --> 34:01.000
and that's all we'll disclose
until the lab reports are ready.

34:01.720 --> 34:05.280
The suspect had tried to stash away

34:05.360 --> 34:09.640
some of the victim's belongings
in a bag like this.

34:09.720 --> 34:13.880
<i>These bags are used</i>
<i>at the refugee center.</i>

34:16.560 --> 34:18.720
<i>This is a tragedy,</i>

34:18.800 --> 34:22.080
<i>so it's important now</i>
<i>that we take care of one another.</i>

34:22.160 --> 34:26.960
<i>That especially means that people</i>
<i>refrain from spreading rumors</i>

34:27.040 --> 34:31.920
<i>and creating fear</i>
<i>on what I call antisocial media.</i>

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
<i>And that we simply act decently.</i>

34:34.080 --> 34:38.560
We have a source saying
the victim committed vandalism...

34:38.640 --> 34:39.600
What did I say?

34:40.600 --> 34:41.800
The black guy.

34:43.280 --> 34:45.360
Let's see what the legal system says.

34:45.440 --> 34:49.360
Just because I'm against crowding
this town with refugees...

34:50.760 --> 34:52.400
doesn't mean I'm a racist.

34:52.480 --> 34:55.920
I've read what you've written.
I think I know what you're thinking.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.040
I've tried to dig into you as well.

35:00.520 --> 35:02.080
But there's very little to find.

35:03.120 --> 35:05.440
You're led by emotions, aren't you?

35:06.440 --> 35:08.320
Marked by the color of your kid.

35:10.280 --> 35:12.880
You be careful.
Be really fucking careful!

35:14.360 --> 35:15.840
You're emotional.

35:17.600 --> 35:19.800
Stay the fuck away from me.

35:39.400 --> 35:43.480
Kjetil Vang was reported
for violent behavior and threats

35:43.560 --> 35:45.400
by his ex-wife four years ago.

35:46.840 --> 35:48.200
<i>But she dropped the charges,</i>

35:48.280 --> 35:51.360
<i>and after that there's nothing</i>
<i>on the lawyer, really.</i>

35:52.520 --> 35:53.560
But...

35:53.640 --> 35:55.240
But?

35:55.320 --> 35:59.160
<i>He's on a short list</i>
<i>of people marked as possible RWE.</i>

35:59.840 --> 36:03.480
<i>He's been playing around with Pegida,</i>
<i>bought a few websites for them.</i>

36:03.560 --> 36:07.640
<i>He has commented on alt-right sites</i>
<i>in the US and some 4chan groups.</i>

36:07.720 --> 36:10.320
<i>But does this have anything to do</i>
<i>with the dead kid?</i>

36:20.360 --> 36:22.120
<i>At the same time, four years ago,</i>

36:22.200 --> 36:25.000
<i>PST tried</i>
<i>to track down an alt-right blogger</i>

36:25.080 --> 36:26.440
<i>in the area you are in now.</i>

36:27.520 --> 36:28.520
"Cato."

36:31.680 --> 36:33.680
<i>Considered a beacon</i>
<i>on the dark web.</i>

36:33.760 --> 36:36.040
<i>Your guy was a person of interest.</i>

36:36.960 --> 36:38.360
Where can I read his stuff?

36:38.880 --> 36:41.240
<i>There are Russian,</i>
<i>German and British blogs.</i>

36:41.320 --> 36:44.000
<i>It's as dark as it gets.</i>

36:44.080 --> 36:46.520
<i>He's also on the same site</i>
<i>as Fjordman.</i>

36:46.600 --> 36:48.960
That Gates site?

36:49.040 --> 36:51.920
<i>Yeah, but Cato is bigger.</i>

36:52.000 --> 36:54.160
Much, much bigger.

36:54.240 --> 36:57.280
He has 250,000 readers every week.

36:57.360 --> 37:01.720
That's not counting the dark web,
deep web, 4chan and 8chan.

37:01.800 --> 37:05.440
But the weird thing is
that when Fjordman was outed,

37:05.520 --> 37:08.280
Cato went off the grid.

37:09.320 --> 37:12.560
<i>And it's been four years since</i>
<i>anything's been uploaded from Norway.</i>

37:12.640 --> 37:17.880
<i>Since then, PST hasn't traced</i>
<i>any activity to your area.</i>

37:18.680 --> 37:20.760
<i>Nothing that's been logged, at least.</i>

37:43.400 --> 37:45.520
<i>You think this Cato quit?</i>

37:46.080 --> 37:49.520
<i>No. He's active.</i>
<i>He posts stuff every month.</i>

37:51.200 --> 37:53.760
<i>He also wrote</i>
<i>a manifesto 14 years ago</i>

37:53.840 --> 37:56.920
<i>that's become a source of inspiration</i>
<i>for all those crazy guys,</i>

37:57.000 --> 37:58.800
<i>including the one on New Zealand</i>

37:58.880 --> 38:02.120
<i>and our very own guy</i>
<i>from the mosque in Bærum.</i>

38:03.360 --> 38:09.240
<i>Right now, Cato's texts are uploaded</i>
<i>from Germany, Spain, Belgium.</i>

38:09.320 --> 38:12.800
Linguistic analyses have shown
that he's not Norwegian.

38:13.600 --> 38:16.640
<i>They've collaborated</i>
<i>to find out where he's from,</i>

38:16.720 --> 38:18.640
<i>but they don't seem</i>
<i>to have an answer.</i>

38:19.400 --> 38:21.800
<i>So Cato is still unknown.</i>

38:24.120 --> 38:25.640
<i>Don't do anything stupid.</i>

38:25.720 --> 38:27.120
I won't.

38:28.120 --> 38:32.320
<i>My daughter's going to grow up here.</i>
<i>I'm just going to keep my eyes open.</i>

42:26.080 --> 42:28.200
Make us some coffee.

42:37.600 --> 42:39.760
Today you need
to listen extra carefully.

42:40.400 --> 42:44.560
What I'm about to say
is not to be discussed with anyone.

42:44.640 --> 42:46.240
Not even among yourselves.

42:47.080 --> 42:50.080
Nobody brought their phones
with them, right?

42:52.440 --> 42:53.720
Good.

42:54.920 --> 42:59.040
We've tried
to build a community here.

42:59.640 --> 43:02.280
Provide safety for our children
and our children's children

43:02.360 --> 43:05.800
from the conflicts they're inevitably
going to face in the future.

43:08.520 --> 43:10.800
We're going to share our ideas,

43:10.880 --> 43:12.760
nourish our culture

43:12.840 --> 43:16.480
and create a healthy
and resilient sense of identity

43:16.560 --> 43:19.160
that we can be proud of
here in our town

43:19.680 --> 43:20.920
and in our country.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.440
We've heard all this before.

43:27.080 --> 43:30.840
We must use this.
Mobilize for something more.

43:31.440 --> 43:33.240
People are starting to wake up.

43:34.000 --> 43:37.000
If anyone here took us
for being Pegida morons,

43:37.680 --> 43:39.880
parade-marching,

43:39.960 --> 43:44.080
hail-greeting skinheads
or guys who love uniforms,

43:44.160 --> 43:47.160
they don't get
what identitarianism means,

43:47.240 --> 43:48.480
or counter-jihad.

43:52.160 --> 43:53.840
Everything we have taught you

43:54.640 --> 43:57.360
about our culture

43:57.440 --> 44:01.080
is to be better, to be decent folks.

44:03.400 --> 44:07.360
And your idea of bringing Pegida
to this town is idiotic.

44:07.440 --> 44:10.760
-Don't call me an idiot.
-I could call you worse, so shut up.

44:15.680 --> 44:17.240
After Stein was killed,

44:18.080 --> 44:19.840
everything has changed.

44:19.920 --> 44:21.840
He was a good kid.
He should be alive.

44:26.600 --> 44:29.040
But they caught the killer.

44:30.400 --> 44:36.000
They found evidence on an African,
and that's all we know.

44:40.360 --> 44:43.960
They found stuff in his closet that
connected him to the scene and Stein.

44:53.120 --> 44:54.720
Someone took the risk

44:55.840 --> 44:57.760
and planted that evidence

44:59.200 --> 45:01.000
and tipped off
the police anonymously.

45:03.040 --> 45:05.080
But none of us did it.

45:06.080 --> 45:08.320
We won't get into that today.

45:16.560 --> 45:19.040
But there are people here
with violent pasts

45:19.120 --> 45:20.840
that not everyone knows about.

45:22.160 --> 45:24.520
And we don't need that attention now.

45:30.440 --> 45:34.760
And if any of you fuck
with that refugee center

45:34.840 --> 45:37.280
or anyone connected to it again,

45:37.360 --> 45:40.000
you'll have bigger problems
than the police.

45:41.200 --> 45:42.240
John?

45:44.760 --> 45:47.520
Be quiet. Understand?

45:48.640 --> 45:49.840
Okay, come on.

45:55.480 --> 45:56.760
Quiet.

45:56.840 --> 45:58.440
Drop it.

45:59.480 --> 46:02.000
Quiet. And don't move.

46:06.280 --> 46:09.000
Bjørn! There's someone in here!

46:09.080 --> 46:12.120
Don't move.

46:12.200 --> 46:14.480
Easy. Don't move.

46:15.040 --> 46:17.320
Are you calm?

46:18.280 --> 46:20.880
Have you calmed down?

46:21.960 --> 46:23.000
Great.

46:23.080 --> 46:25.520
Everyone just stay still,
and this will be fine.

46:25.600 --> 46:27.040
This is private property.

46:30.760 --> 46:33.680
Stay calm.

46:44.000 --> 46:45.400
Drop the gun!

46:46.600 --> 46:48.400
What the fuck are you doing here?

46:51.800 --> 46:52.920
Drop the gun.

46:54.320 --> 46:55.200
Don't do it.

46:55.280 --> 46:57.480
Drop the gun!

46:57.560 --> 47:00.040
-He won't shoot anyone.
-He heard your rambling.

47:02.440 --> 47:03.680
I'll shoot you!

47:08.320 --> 47:09.880
I promise you I'll shoot.

47:15.080 --> 47:16.960
Drop the gun.

47:30.160 --> 47:33.000
Come on! Pull back!

47:35.360 --> 47:36.360
Okay.

47:45.560 --> 47:46.920
You fucking idiot.

47:47.000 --> 47:51.240
You goddamn fucking idiot.
You don't know what you've messed up.

47:51.320 --> 47:54.320
He would've shot us both,
do you understand?

47:55.680 --> 47:58.800
It's going to be fine.

47:58.880 --> 48:01.240
Just take it easy
and give me the gun.

48:02.040 --> 48:03.920
Give me the gun.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.120
I work for the fucking PST.

48:07.680 --> 48:11.240
I've been here over a year. It took
three years to find the brothers.

48:16.280 --> 48:17.360
What the...!

48:22.480 --> 48:24.200
Don't tell anyone about me.

48:24.280 --> 48:26.440
Not even the cops.
They have people there.

48:27.200 --> 48:28.400
And stay here.

48:54.040 --> 48:57.040
