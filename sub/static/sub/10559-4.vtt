00:49.640 --> 00:53.918
Calm yourself, Nancy,
or you'll be chipping the fine china.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.639
- Imagine the trouble then!
- Don't joke at a time like this!

00:56.720 --> 01:00.872
- Don't fret. All will be well.
- Billy, I'm worried...

01:00.960 --> 01:05.750
- Three cups, Nancy.
- Make it four. Another's expected.

01:07.080 --> 01:08.832
So, did you do it?

01:14.120 --> 01:15.633
Did you do it?

01:37.360 --> 01:40.397
- Your tea, sir.
- Oh, wonderful. Much thanks.

01:40.480 --> 01:43.040
- Two lumps, yes?
- Yes, sir.

01:43.600 --> 01:45.113
Oh my, lovely aroma!

01:45.600 --> 01:47.989
- Good morning, Constable Crabtree.
- Ah, sir!

01:51.400 --> 01:54.039
Detective, this is Mr Heward.

01:54.120 --> 01:56.873
Mr Heward, Detective Murdoch.
Mr Heward is the butler, sir.

01:56.960 --> 01:59.155
I take it
you'll be forgoing tea, Detective?

01:59.640 --> 02:00.629
Yes.

02:01.040 --> 02:02.189
That'll be all, Billy.

02:04.720 --> 02:07.029
- What have you, George?
- Sir, the housekeeper discovered...

02:09.039 --> 02:10.189
I'm very sorry, sir.

02:15.280 --> 02:17.316
The housekeeper
discovered the body at 8:30.

02:17.400 --> 02:20.278
The victim's wife was the last
to see him alive at quarter past.

02:20.360 --> 02:24.148
A difference of 15 minutes.
A small window of opportunity.

02:24.240 --> 02:26.515
Mr Heward,
was there any sign of an intruder?

02:26.600 --> 02:27.589
No, sir.

02:27.680 --> 02:29.477
The windows and doors were intact.

02:38.840 --> 02:40.353
A possible murder weapon, sir.

02:41.400 --> 02:45.075
Yes. But there's no blood on it.
The killer could have wiped it clean.

02:45.160 --> 02:47.151
I'll have it dusted for finger marks
in any case.

02:47.680 --> 02:48.874
Very good, George.

02:49.440 --> 02:52.079
Gentlemen, if there's nothing further
required for the moment?

02:52.160 --> 02:53.752
No, Mr Heward, that will be all.
Thank you.

02:56.040 --> 02:59.919
Sir, if the house was locked up tight,
the killer must live here.

03:00.920 --> 03:03.514
Yes, we'll need statements
from the staff and family, George.

03:03.600 --> 03:04.953
I have the lads seeing to that now.

03:05.040 --> 03:06.917
Very good. Have you notified Dr Francis?

03:07.000 --> 03:08.831
He's on his way,
although I fear my telephone call

03:08.920 --> 03:10.433
may have interrupted his breakfast.

03:10.520 --> 03:13.239
- I take it he was less than pleased?
- As usual, sir.

03:13.320 --> 03:16.357
What do you think he'll have to say
about the cause of Mr Jenkins' death?

03:16.440 --> 03:18.396
Well, with his gift
for stating the obvious,

03:18.480 --> 03:21.677
he'll no doubt conclude
that this was not a case of poisoning.

03:29.280 --> 03:31.157
Men's clothes exclusively.

03:31.240 --> 03:34.152
Yes, sir.
Mrs Jenkins has a bedroom down the hall.

03:34.240 --> 03:37.198
I believe that's common practice
with these upper-crust folks.

03:37.280 --> 03:40.875
Yes, well, two people slept in this bed
last night.

03:40.960 --> 03:43.315
Ah, at last!
I was running out of rooms.

03:43.760 --> 03:45.512
Dr Francis, good morning.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.636
Hmm. For some it is, I suppose.

03:49.240 --> 03:51.800
That said, if we take this gentleman...

03:53.800 --> 03:57.952
His condition frames my unfinished
boiled egg in stark perspective.

03:58.840 --> 04:01.798
Dead less than two hours.
Nasty little hole in the head.

04:01.880 --> 04:04.110
Doctor, would you say the gaff
from a fireplace poker

04:04.200 --> 04:06.998
could be in keeping with
what you see here?

04:07.080 --> 04:11.517
Why not? I'll know better when I flush
and drain the wound back at the morgue,

04:12.360 --> 04:13.873
my home away from home,

04:14.360 --> 04:15.759
away from home.

04:26.880 --> 04:28.791
- Constable Crabtree!
- Sir?

04:28.880 --> 04:32.350
- Has the house been secured?
- It has and I've posted a man here, sir.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.634
Very good. What have you?

04:33.720 --> 04:37.156
Well, sir, we have nine people
in the home at the time of the murder.

04:37.680 --> 04:38.749
Carry on.

04:38.840 --> 04:40.910
As you know,
the deceased is Percival Jenkins.

04:41.120 --> 04:45.750
In relation to him, we have his mother,
Mrs Jenkins Senior,

04:45.840 --> 04:50.834
his wife Nora, the youngest son Nicholas
and his fiancée Clara Thorn.

04:50.920 --> 04:54.754
The older son Victor is upstairs.
Apparently, he'll be along shortly.

04:54.840 --> 04:58.196
As for servants, we have
the housekeeper Miss Allen,

04:58.280 --> 05:01.397
Nancy Booth the scullery maid,
Florence Cullwick the parlour maid

05:01.480 --> 05:03.391
and Billy Slater the footman.

05:03.560 --> 05:06.074
Hmm. You've left out
Mr Heward, the butler.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.356
Mr Heward was at the tailor

05:08.440 --> 05:10.908
between 8:00 and 8:30
picking up a suit for Mr Jenkins.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.513
Or so he says.

05:12.600 --> 05:15.034
- Thank you, George. Please confirm that.
- I will do, sir.

05:15.120 --> 05:18.795
Also, the parlour maid
Florence Cullwick says

05:18.880 --> 05:20.518
that she heard Mr Jenkins and his wife

05:20.600 --> 05:24.388
- arguing about ten past eight.
- Indeed? Thank you, George.

05:27.080 --> 05:29.275
- Is that the new coachman?
- Hush, Mother-in-law.

05:29.360 --> 05:30.349
Ladies and gentlemen,

05:30.440 --> 05:32.351
my name is Detective William Murdoch
of the Toronto...

05:32.440 --> 05:34.317
I hope I haven't kept you all waiting...

05:34.400 --> 05:38.154
Toronto Constabulary, I believe
you were about to say. Please carry on.

05:41.560 --> 05:43.755
How like you, Victor,
the grand entrance,

05:43.840 --> 05:45.796
even on the morning
of Father's death!

05:45.880 --> 05:46.995
I'm sure you'd prefer

05:47.080 --> 05:49.878
I slink in guiltily
as you would have, Nicholas,

05:49.960 --> 05:52.758
but, unlike you, I didn't kill Father.

05:52.840 --> 05:55.400
- Take that back! You take that back!
- Boys, for God's sake!

05:55.480 --> 05:57.436
All right, that's quite enough,
both of you.

05:57.840 --> 05:59.592
The detective has something to say.

06:04.240 --> 06:09.519
A man was murdered in this house.
I offer my condolences and my assurance

06:09.600 --> 06:13.673
that the constabulary will bring the
perpetrator of this crime to justice.

06:14.080 --> 06:15.832
Now, you've all given your statements.

06:15.920 --> 06:16.989
Over the next few days,

06:17.080 --> 06:19.275
we'll be comparing those statements
and gathering evidence.

06:19.800 --> 06:22.189
Detective, are you saying
that we're all suspects?

06:22.280 --> 06:25.272
I'm merely asking that you keep
yourselves available for questioning.

06:27.720 --> 06:30.598
That will be all for now. Thank you
very much for your cooperation.

06:32.240 --> 06:34.800
Mrs Jenkins, if you could remain.

06:37.520 --> 06:39.590
Will you be needing anything, madam?

06:43.000 --> 06:47.471
- Mrs Jenkins, my sincere sympathies.
- Yes.

06:48.440 --> 06:50.670
I understand you and your husband
were having an argument

06:50.760 --> 06:53.069
- shortly before he was found dead?
- Who told you that?

06:53.840 --> 06:55.956
What was the argument about?

06:56.280 --> 06:59.397
It was a personal matter.
It had nothing to do with this.

06:59.480 --> 07:00.959
Please answer the question.

07:02.560 --> 07:05.950
He'd been rude and impossible,
as always.

07:06.480 --> 07:08.948
Is that enough of an answer for you?

07:09.040 --> 07:12.191
Did you sleep in your husband's bed I
ast night, Mrs Jenkins?

07:13.240 --> 07:15.879
No, I did not.

07:18.280 --> 07:20.635
Thank you for your time, Mrs Jenkins.

07:26.960 --> 07:28.359
Oh, good, a chart.

07:28.960 --> 07:31.713
Sir, in a case with 10 suspects,

07:31.800 --> 07:34.360
careful organisation of information
is paramount.

07:34.680 --> 07:36.079
I'll make a note of that.

07:36.160 --> 07:39.675
First task is to determine
who had opportunity to kill Mr Jenkins,

07:39.760 --> 07:42.035
of those who had motive
and with evidence,

07:42.120 --> 07:44.190
hopefully that list
will be narrowed down to one.

07:44.280 --> 07:45.952
And do you have any evidence?

07:46.040 --> 07:47.109
No, sir.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.555
- Yes, George?
- Sir, I've confirmed the butler's alibi.

07:49.640 --> 07:52.791
Oh, bravo, Murdoch!
One down, nine to go. Ha!

07:52.880 --> 07:55.997
Also, sir, I found two sets of
finger marks on the bedroom poker,

07:56.080 --> 07:58.514
the first set belonging to
Florence Cullwick, the parlour maid...

07:58.600 --> 07:59.669
Well, that's to be expected.

08:00.160 --> 08:02.515
Parlour maids generally tend
to the fires in the big houses.

08:02.600 --> 08:05.956
The other set belonged
to Nicholas Jenkins, the youngest son.

08:06.280 --> 08:10.592
Yes, I used the poker, attending to
the fire in my father's room last night.

08:10.680 --> 08:12.716
Isn't that usually the job of the maid?

08:12.800 --> 08:17.112
How absurd to ring for the maid to do
something I could so easily do myself!

08:17.920 --> 08:19.558
What were you doing
in your father's room?

08:20.360 --> 08:21.475
We were having words.

08:22.520 --> 08:25.910
- About?
- He had insulted my fiancée Clara.

08:26.400 --> 08:27.469
How so?

08:27.560 --> 08:29.391
One of the servants had told him
that Clara had gone down

08:29.480 --> 08:32.789
to their quarters to fetch some thread
instead of ringing them to bring it up.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.034
And?

08:35.120 --> 08:38.395
He intimated that's where
Clara belonged, downstairs.

08:38.480 --> 08:40.072
My parents feel
she's not good enough for me.

08:40.159 --> 08:43.674
But my family, to my shame,
is not nearly good enough for her.

08:43.799 --> 08:47.679
I see. And where were you between
8:15 and 8:30 this morning?

08:48.520 --> 08:50.829
- In the library.
- Can anyone confirm this?

08:51.000 --> 08:54.595
Billy brought me tea and the morning
papers, but that was before 8:00.

08:54.960 --> 08:57.030
<i>You don't think Nicholas
did his old man in then?</i>

08:57.200 --> 09:01.591
Sir, the guilty rarely volunteer
their motive or undercut their alibi.

09:02.200 --> 09:05.033
More than anything,
he appears to be a man in love.

09:05.520 --> 09:09.115
That's him finished with, then!
So that just leaves the parlour maid?

09:09.200 --> 09:11.760
Yes, Florence Cullwick,
whom, as you said,

09:11.840 --> 09:14.308
tends to every fire in the household.

09:14.400 --> 09:16.789
Now if the murder weapon was
indeed a fireplace poker,

09:16.880 --> 09:19.599
then perhaps it just wasn't the one
in Mr Jenkins' room.

09:20.200 --> 09:23.749
George, see to it that every fire poker
in the house is brought in

09:23.840 --> 09:26.115
- and dusted for finger marks.
- Sure. Will do.

09:26.640 --> 09:29.996
Now then, I need some certainty
about this murder weapon.

09:33.560 --> 09:36.154
Ah, Murdoch,
with your usual impeccable timing.

09:36.240 --> 09:39.630
I'm off to an early dinner with my wife,
then a recital.

09:40.000 --> 09:45.950
- Musical saw and spoons, no doubt!
- I only require a moment of your time.

09:47.440 --> 09:49.351
Cause of death, wound to the head.

09:49.440 --> 09:51.749
Approximately three
and five-sixteenth inches deep.

09:51.840 --> 09:55.276
I think your poker theory
has some merit.

09:55.360 --> 09:57.590
Wonderful.
Could you make a mould of the wound,

09:57.680 --> 09:59.671
so I can compare it
to potential murder weapons?

09:59.760 --> 10:01.637
I've never done such a thing

10:01.720 --> 10:04.757
- and I'm not about to start now.
- Why not?

10:08.760 --> 10:10.239
You know, Murdoch,

10:11.560 --> 10:13.869
there is more to life than this.

10:26.040 --> 10:27.792
This is all of them, sir.

10:30.720 --> 10:34.759
No two are alike. I assume they've been
checked for blood and finger marks?

10:34.840 --> 10:36.910
Yes, sir. No blood,
and curiously enough,

10:37.000 --> 10:38.752
most of the handles
have been wiped down.

10:38.840 --> 10:41.229
I'm wondering if the killer perhaps
forgot which one he used.

10:41.320 --> 10:43.993
I imagine the parlour maid
could have cleaned all of the handles

10:44.080 --> 10:45.069
during the course of her daily duties.

10:46.960 --> 10:48.837
So this is a model
of the Jenkins house, sir?

10:49.920 --> 10:50.909
After a crude fashion, George.

10:52.280 --> 10:54.635
The dark chess pieces
represent the Jenkins family

10:54.720 --> 10:57.075
and the white ones stand in
for the servants.

10:57.640 --> 11:01.110
Ah! So this is Victor Jenkins
in his bedroom?

11:01.200 --> 11:04.829
Yes, and Victor's brother
Nicholas Jenkins in the library.

11:05.520 --> 11:08.796
This is Clara Thorn,
the fiancée, in the morning room.

11:09.280 --> 11:12.556
And Nora Jenkins, the wife,
in the conservatory and so on.

11:12.640 --> 11:16.918
George, I think if we can determine
which room the murder weapon came from,

11:17.000 --> 11:19.195
we might have our killer.

11:19.280 --> 11:21.794
Sir, I can imagine this to be some sort
of board game.

11:21.880 --> 11:25.031
Players would get clues pertaining
to certain suspects.

11:25.120 --> 11:26.917
Whoever figured out the murderer,
would be the winner.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.719
George, I'm sure people
would find murder far too grave

11:29.800 --> 11:31.995
for it to be the subject
of frivolous entertainment.

11:32.080 --> 11:35.914
Oh, I hope not, sir. I'm 12 pages
into my murder mystery.

11:36.000 --> 11:40.437
I've set it in Toronto where an ancient
Egyptian curse wreaks havoc on a...

11:40.520 --> 11:42.556
George, have a look at this.

11:43.440 --> 11:49.993
From this position, the black queen
can see anyone entering or exiting

11:50.080 --> 11:52.674
this hallway area
from either set of stairs.

11:53.600 --> 11:54.669
Who's the black queen, sir?

11:55.280 --> 11:59.592
Mrs Jenkins, you were in your chair
this morning having your tea.

11:59.680 --> 12:02.558
- Do you remember?
- Of course I remember. Why shouldn't I?

12:04.160 --> 12:08.199
Did you happen to see anyone go into
or come out of your son's bedroom?

12:08.280 --> 12:11.511
Yes, it was Alma
going to stoke the fire.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.875
Alma was a maid here many years ago.

12:15.120 --> 12:18.908
Your ladyship, Alma's been gone
a very long time.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.913
It was Alma. Has everyone gone stupid
except for me?

12:23.520 --> 12:25.795
Percy always liked Alma.

12:25.880 --> 12:29.555
Pretty, she was. Looked like a swan
but walked like a duck.

12:30.160 --> 12:33.357
Oh, where is Percy anyway?

12:34.040 --> 12:37.032
He was supposed to take me to the opera.

12:37.120 --> 12:41.477
- Mrs Jenkins does get confused at times.
- I see.

12:42.760 --> 12:45.115
Thank you very much for your...

12:59.240 --> 13:00.958
What are you doing?

13:03.720 --> 13:07.110
I was just looking
for my father's watch.

13:07.200 --> 13:11.034
- Oh, and here it is.
- Please put that back.

13:11.120 --> 13:15.591
- And you, Miss Cullwick...
- I asked Florence to assist me.

13:15.680 --> 13:19.514
You have no business being in this room.
This is a crime scene. Quite off limits.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.716
Apologies. I had no idea.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.758
Mr Jenkins, in your written statement
you say that you were in bed

13:24.840 --> 13:26.831
between 8:15 and 8:30 this morning?

13:26.920 --> 13:29.309
Sleeping off a drinking binge,
I'm afraid.

13:30.920 --> 13:33.434
And, Miss Cullwick,
you say you were in the morning room,

13:33.520 --> 13:35.511
cleaning when Mr Jenkins Senior
was killed?

13:35.920 --> 13:37.035
Yes, sir.

13:37.120 --> 13:40.396
Oddly, Miss Thorn made no mention
of seeing you there in her statement.

13:41.200 --> 13:43.555
I work so quietly,
I'm sure she didn't notice me.

13:43.640 --> 13:46.200
- Are we free to go?
- No.

13:46.600 --> 13:49.558
Mr Jenkins, what did you mean
when you said to your brother,

13:49.640 --> 13:51.915
"Unlike you, I didn't kill Father"?

13:52.000 --> 13:54.070
I was getting a rise out of him.

13:54.160 --> 13:57.789
Nicky could no more kill Father
than he could swear in front of a woman.

13:58.800 --> 14:02.315
- Anything else?
- Yes. Stay out of this room.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.036
- Julia!
- Detective!

14:18.560 --> 14:20.630
I thought I might see you here.

14:24.680 --> 14:28.355
It's wonderful to see you,
though somewhat unexpected.

14:28.440 --> 14:29.919
Yes, I know, it must be.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.673
I dropped by to offer my condolences.
Our families are acquainted.

14:33.800 --> 14:36.439
But you couldn't have come from Buffalo
in such a short time?

14:37.000 --> 14:41.869
- No. I was already in town.
- Oh.

14:41.960 --> 14:46.511
Yes. For the rest of the week, actually.
To introduce Darcy to my family.

14:46.600 --> 14:47.999
Your fiancé. Yes, of course.

14:48.080 --> 14:49.991
He's just saying goodbye
to Mrs Jenkins.

14:50.080 --> 14:54.949
William, they're saying that Mr Jenkins
was murdered. What have you found?

14:55.640 --> 14:57.676
The cause of death
was a single blow to the head.

14:57.760 --> 15:00.399
I believe a fire poker was used.

15:00.480 --> 15:02.948
I've asked Dr Francis
to take a cast of the wound.

15:03.040 --> 15:04.792
Yes, to determine the murder weapon.

15:04.880 --> 15:07.030
- But he's refused.
- Why?

15:07.120 --> 15:08.155
It's simple enough.

15:08.240 --> 15:09.593
The brain matter
will cling to the plaster,

15:09.680 --> 15:10.999
so you can only do it once, but...

15:11.080 --> 15:12.991
Might there be another casting material

15:13.080 --> 15:15.878
that would not disrupt
the victim's brain tissue?

15:16.360 --> 15:20.638
- What are you suggesting?
- If Dr Francis were to never find out...

15:21.280 --> 15:23.589
William! I couldn't.

15:23.680 --> 15:25.477
Such conspiratorial whispers!

15:26.400 --> 15:28.755
Darcy, I believe
you know Detective Murdoch.

15:29.520 --> 15:32.034
- A pleasure to see you again, Detective.
- And you.

15:32.520 --> 15:36.035
Detective Murdoch was asking me
to help him with a case,

15:36.120 --> 15:38.509
but I'd like to remind him
that the last time he did that,

15:38.600 --> 15:39.794
the feathers quite hit the fan!

15:41.040 --> 15:44.077
Yes. Well, Dr Francis has gone home...

15:44.160 --> 15:47.596
I would love to help you, but I can't.
My family is expecting us for dinner.

15:47.680 --> 15:50.399
Oh, nonsense. You can tell them
you've been called away.

15:51.160 --> 15:54.277
And I'll charm them so completely,
they won't even notice you're not there.

15:54.360 --> 15:56.828
Darcy, that's lovely but...

15:57.320 --> 15:59.470
I can see you want to do this.
Go on, darling.

16:01.320 --> 16:05.438
Well, Detective, I think I may know of
the perfect moulding material.

16:10.280 --> 16:12.874
- Jell-O?
- It's made of gelatine.

16:12.960 --> 16:16.077
It should take the form of the wound
without adhering to the brain tissue.

16:16.160 --> 16:18.958
And you say
this Jell-O is served as dessert?

16:19.040 --> 16:23.158
It's all the rage in Buffalo.
I brought some home for my family.

16:23.240 --> 16:27.836
- Hmm. How long does it take to set?
- Not too long, if refrigerated.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.956
- Julia...
- Yes?

16:30.520 --> 16:34.479
It's agreeable to see you
working here again. You are missed.

16:35.160 --> 16:38.948
Yes, of course.
You're still at odds with Dr Francis.

16:39.040 --> 16:41.554
True, but aside from Dr Francis,
I meant.

16:42.320 --> 16:44.197
Actually, he and I are making headway.

16:44.840 --> 16:48.116
- Oh. Really?
- Yes.

16:48.200 --> 16:49.474
At last!

16:51.680 --> 16:53.671
How well did you know the Jenkins?

16:53.760 --> 16:55.637
My mother and Mrs Jenkins
were bridge partners.

16:55.720 --> 16:57.950
I'd sometimes be left over there
to play.

16:58.040 --> 17:00.998
- What were they like?
- Victor was a hellion.

17:01.560 --> 17:04.313
He was mean to me and even meaner
to poor Nicholas.

17:04.880 --> 17:08.474
- And the parents?
- Mrs Jenkins was ruthless,

17:08.560 --> 17:12.234
her mother even worse.
They treated their servants shamefully.

17:13.920 --> 17:16.559
- And Mr Jenkins?
- I stayed away from him.

17:16.640 --> 17:18.915
- He was disturbing.
- How so?

17:19.000 --> 17:23.790
Well, one day I was in the upper
hallway during a game of hide and seek.

17:23.880 --> 17:27.429
Mr Jenkins' bedroom door opened
and a maid ran out sobbing.

17:27.520 --> 17:29.317
When I turned around,
Jenkins was standing there

17:29.400 --> 17:31.391
in a state of partial undress.

17:32.640 --> 17:33.755
I see.

17:35.760 --> 17:37.318
Good. I think he's done.

17:41.400 --> 17:43.470
Now let's see what we have.

17:48.200 --> 17:50.316
It's somewhat stubborn.

17:50.400 --> 17:54.518
- What exactly is going on in here?
- Dr Francis...

17:55.120 --> 17:59.750
- Dr Ogden.
- At last! The famous Dr Ogden!

18:00.600 --> 18:02.477
You know, I've grown to expect duplicity

18:02.560 --> 18:04.755
from Murdoch, Doctor,
but from a colleague...

18:04.840 --> 18:06.910
Yes, it's quite unforgivable.

18:07.000 --> 18:11.596
I've come to make that mould
you asked me for earlier,

18:11.680 --> 18:14.274
but I see
you didn't trouble yourself to wait.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.396
You told me you had no intention
of making the mould.

18:16.480 --> 18:20.155
I said I had no intention of making it
at that moment!

18:22.160 --> 18:24.833
Surely, even here
on the edge of civilisation,

18:24.920 --> 18:27.593
a man has the right
to dine with his wife?

18:29.760 --> 18:30.909
I misunderstood.

18:33.440 --> 18:34.509
You know, Detective,

18:36.360 --> 18:39.158
from the first day I arrived,

18:39.240 --> 18:42.755
you have, almost without exception,
shown a complete lack of faith in me.

18:42.840 --> 18:46.879
I'd like to ask you now,
why the hell that is?

18:49.040 --> 18:51.429
It's not a lack of faith in you.

18:57.560 --> 18:58.754
Look...

19:01.120 --> 19:02.269
I see.

19:04.160 --> 19:05.229
I...

19:07.160 --> 19:12.837
Fifteen years in Scotland Yard
to reach the top of my profession,

19:12.920 --> 19:15.514
all gone to reward of black flies
and snowstorms,

19:15.600 --> 19:17.318
all in the service
of my wife's happiness.

19:17.400 --> 19:19.277
I've moved to her hometown.

19:19.360 --> 19:23.558
I valued that above all else,
her happiness, or once did.

19:26.040 --> 19:27.598
I should never have left.

19:29.920 --> 19:31.911
I don't belong in Toronto.

19:39.880 --> 19:42.075
You can have your morgue back, Dr Ogden.

19:42.160 --> 19:45.118
No, Dr Francis,
that's not what I'm here for.

19:51.120 --> 19:53.076
I've no doubt you actually believe that.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.955
But we belong where we belong.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.633
Good evening to you.

20:08.600 --> 20:10.272
I was the one
who convinced the top brass

20:10.360 --> 20:12.112
to bring Dr Francis over here
in the first place.

20:12.200 --> 20:15.112
Now, thanks to you,
I look like a bloody fool!

20:15.360 --> 20:16.952
He's booked his passage home.

20:17.040 --> 20:20.157
His wife telephoned
Chief Constable Stockton in tears.

20:20.240 --> 20:22.834
Well, sir, if Dr Francis was truly
not happy...

20:22.920 --> 20:24.638
Of course he's not happy here, Murdoch,

20:24.720 --> 20:27.029
but he might not have noticed
if it wasn't for you!

20:27.120 --> 20:29.588
And why does everyone want to be happy
these days anyway?

20:29.680 --> 20:30.669
Besides which,

20:30.760 --> 20:33.911
I don't care if Dr Francis is as happy
as a pig in its own filth.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.197
I care if I'm happy
and I'm bloody well not! And...

20:37.280 --> 20:39.157
Bloody hell,
I've lost my train of thought!

20:41.000 --> 20:42.752
Well, then, sir,
perhaps we should discuss

20:42.840 --> 20:44.717
the Percival Jenkins murder case.

20:46.400 --> 20:49.278
Aside from dancing the two-step
with Dr Ogden,

20:50.120 --> 20:51.678
you'd best have
something to show for this.

20:51.760 --> 20:52.875
I do, sir.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.110
The murder weapon
from the main floor parlour.

20:55.200 --> 20:58.351
- Who said the killer was in the parlour?
- No one, sir.

20:58.440 --> 21:01.591
The point is,
the shape of the gaff is the same

21:01.680 --> 21:03.477
as that of the mould that Dr Ogden took.

21:03.560 --> 21:04.709
Any finger marks?

21:04.800 --> 21:08.554
Yes, sir, a thumb print on the
shaft here, belonging to Clara Thorn.

21:08.640 --> 21:10.710
- So she's your murderer, then.
- I don't think so.

21:10.800 --> 21:12.119
Of course not.

21:12.680 --> 21:15.274
Sir, Clara Thorn was
in the morning room,

21:15.360 --> 21:18.079
as observed by the footman
who was serving tea at the time.

21:18.160 --> 21:20.720
- She could have snuck out.
- Yes, sir.

21:20.800 --> 21:24.554
But the handle was wiped clean of marks.

21:24.640 --> 21:26.119
If Miss Thorn was the killer,

21:26.200 --> 21:28.839
she likely would have wiped off
the entire poker, one would think.

21:28.920 --> 21:30.353
So who wiped off the marks
from the handle?

21:30.800 --> 21:31.789
The killer.

21:31.880 --> 21:32.915
You've lost me.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.709
Sir, I believe the killer wiped off
several of the fireplace pokers

21:36.800 --> 21:40.156
to obscure which room he came from
and which poker he used.

21:40.240 --> 21:43.357
But we know which poker was used
and we're still not further ahead!

21:44.080 --> 21:47.789
So, now, I've got a missing coroner
and you've got nothing!

21:47.880 --> 21:49.916
Actually, sir, there is something else.

21:50.720 --> 21:53.154
Percival Jenkins
had been taking liberties

21:53.240 --> 21:55.708
with some of the female servants.

21:57.120 --> 22:00.635
Right, well, the big toad
in the puddle, eh?

22:00.720 --> 22:03.792
Someone shared Percival Jenkins' bed
the night that he was killed.

22:04.640 --> 22:07.552
Maybe she's our killer.
You'll need a name.

22:14.120 --> 22:16.156
May I announce you, Detective?

22:16.680 --> 22:19.274
Before you do, Mr Heward,
I have a question.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.230
- A rather sensitive one.
- Of course.

22:22.720 --> 22:25.632
I suspect
that Mr Jenkins had carnal relations

22:25.720 --> 22:27.597
with some of the female servants.

22:28.360 --> 22:30.669
- Can you confirm this?
- I really cannot say, sir.

22:31.960 --> 22:33.632
But you have your suspicions?

22:33.720 --> 22:36.837
Forgive me, Detective,
if I appeared to imply that.

22:36.920 --> 22:40.708
Heward!
Is that that nosy police detective?

22:40.800 --> 22:42.392
Yes, madam!

22:43.840 --> 22:48.277
Mrs Jenkins has her moments of lucidity.
Rather unpredictably.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.035
Interesting.

22:50.680 --> 22:53.274
- Might I announce you now, sir?
- Yes, yes.

22:53.960 --> 22:57.475
- I'll speak with the female servants.
- Very good.

22:59.080 --> 23:01.799
Yes, Mr Jenkins came to my room once.

23:02.480 --> 23:05.472
I told the old coot I'd scream the
house down if he ever tried it again.

23:05.560 --> 23:09.235
- And did he, Miss Cullwick?
- No. He left me alone after that.

23:10.000 --> 23:13.549
However, I believe there were others
who weren't so lucky.

23:14.680 --> 23:17.114
Forced himself on me?
Why would you ask such a thing?

23:19.240 --> 23:22.550
Miss Booth, I believe Mr Jenkins
made advances toward you.

23:23.720 --> 23:26.996
I understand you fear for your
employment in speaking to me of this...

23:27.080 --> 23:29.833
If Mr Jenkins made advances
towards anyone, it was Miss Allen.

23:29.920 --> 23:31.512
Miss Allen the housekeeper?

23:32.040 --> 23:35.350
I saw him put his hand on her bottom
once. She let him keep it there.

23:36.320 --> 23:37.878
What utter nonsense!

23:38.720 --> 23:42.713
Mr Jenkins conducted himself
with absolute decorum at all times.

23:43.640 --> 23:46.677
- He never made advances toward you?
- Never.

23:47.280 --> 23:50.511
- Yet he did toward some of the maids.
- Did he?

23:51.280 --> 23:53.191
Perhaps you should ask his widow.

23:54.080 --> 23:58.631
My principal preoccupation is the smooth
operation of a large household.

23:59.680 --> 24:02.399
Certainly
not my husband's frivolous urges.

24:02.480 --> 24:04.755
- You knew nothing?
- Emphatically not.

24:05.520 --> 24:07.112
Do you have any further questions?

24:07.200 --> 24:10.112
Yes. What were you and your husband
fighting about yesterday?

24:10.760 --> 24:12.239
I've already answered that question.

24:12.320 --> 24:14.754
Mrs Jenkins, we only have your word

24:14.840 --> 24:17.798
that your husband was still alive
when you left that room.

24:17.880 --> 24:20.553
That makes you a likely suspect
in this murder investigation.

24:20.640 --> 24:22.676
Now what were you fighting about?

24:24.840 --> 24:29.038
My husband told Nicholas he'd be
disinherited if he married Clara.

24:29.120 --> 24:31.236
Nicholas threatened to move to Boston.

24:32.920 --> 24:34.717
I couldn't have that.

24:37.040 --> 24:39.793
Clara's family wasn't
aristocratic enough. What presumption!

24:39.880 --> 24:44.351
Clara is educated. She's intelligent.
She cares for the less fortunate.

24:44.480 --> 24:47.916
Now what's more important, the pedigree
of a prospective wife or her character?

24:49.480 --> 24:51.198
But your father
threatened to disinherit...

24:51.280 --> 24:52.713
I didn't want the old bastard's money!

24:52.800 --> 24:54.279
Nicky.

24:54.960 --> 24:56.757
We would have made do.

24:59.680 --> 25:01.432
And did you feel the same way,
Miss Thorn?

25:01.600 --> 25:02.828
Of course.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.150
I come from humble circumstances,
Detective.

25:05.760 --> 25:07.751
In fact, I'm not much at ease
in this world.

25:07.840 --> 25:10.912
At any rate, I doubt my father
would have disinherited me.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.197
He needed to leave his wealth to someone
and he had already disinherited Victor.

25:14.280 --> 25:15.349
Did he?

25:15.440 --> 25:19.592
My brother is a gambler. He would have
squandered the entire estate.

25:21.960 --> 25:23.313
Of course I have debts.

25:23.400 --> 25:26.278
And expediting your inheritance
would be one way of resolving them.

25:26.360 --> 25:30.990
Perhaps, but I didn't kill my father.
Certainly not at that ungodly hour.

25:35.240 --> 25:38.471
Besides, my father
had already disinherited me.

25:38.560 --> 25:41.358
I would have nothing to gain
by his death.

25:42.360 --> 25:44.237
Unless you were to destroy the will.

25:44.800 --> 25:48.270
That's what you were looking for
in your father's room, not a watch.

25:48.600 --> 25:50.158
Very good, Detective.

25:51.320 --> 25:52.799
Yes, that's exactly what I was doing,

25:52.880 --> 25:56.429
but I'm not so stupid
as to kill my father

25:56.520 --> 26:00.149
without having found
and destroyed the will first.

26:00.880 --> 26:04.316
Nevertheless, your father's room
is right next to yours

26:04.400 --> 26:06.231
and you have no alibi.

26:07.880 --> 26:12.351
I told you I was in bed
at the time of my father's murder.

26:12.800 --> 26:14.836
I never said I had no alibi.

26:16.320 --> 26:18.675
So Victor the lush was milking the maid,
was he?

26:18.760 --> 26:20.352
Florence Cullwick. Yes.

26:20.440 --> 26:22.351
The apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

26:22.440 --> 26:24.795
Well, sir, at least now we know
why Miss Cullwick

26:24.880 --> 26:27.110
didn't mention seeing Clara Thorn
in the morning room.

26:27.200 --> 26:30.272
We also know why she said
she heard the Jenkins arguing.

26:30.360 --> 26:32.476
Victor's room is right next door
to Mr Jenkins.

26:33.080 --> 26:34.274
Carry on, Murdoch.

26:36.200 --> 26:39.954
Detective? Souvenirs
from the victim's pillow.

26:40.520 --> 26:42.954
Trace evidence, George. Thank you.

26:44.280 --> 26:46.748
Grey ones are presumably the victim's.

26:48.040 --> 26:51.237
And these longer ones,
I believe I recognise the shade.

26:51.320 --> 26:55.279
Also, sir, we found this handkerchief
in the housekeeper's fireplace.

26:56.080 --> 26:59.038
Sir, I think it was used to wipe
the blood from the murder weapon.

26:59.120 --> 27:00.155
Hmm.

27:02.120 --> 27:04.031
- It's monogrammed.
- Yes, sir.

27:04.120 --> 27:05.189
VA.

27:08.680 --> 27:10.079
George...

27:11.640 --> 27:13.835
Bring Miss Allen in for questioning.

27:17.800 --> 27:19.916
Why would I burn it? It's not even mine.

27:20.640 --> 27:23.712
Your initials are stitched
into the corner of it, Miss Allen.

27:25.360 --> 27:28.955
Good Lord!
My late aunt embroidered this.

27:29.920 --> 27:33.276
I haven't seen this
in I don't know how long. Years.

27:35.640 --> 27:39.838
I didn't kill Mr Jenkins. Why would I?

27:41.560 --> 27:46.429
We also found these hairs in Mr Jenkins'
bed. I believe they're yours.

27:48.560 --> 27:53.190
I sometimes go to his bed
in the middle of the night. It's...

27:53.280 --> 27:55.555
It's shameful, I know, but...

27:58.000 --> 28:01.515
- I was lonely and...
- In love with him?

28:06.080 --> 28:10.198
You see, I could never have harmed
Percival. You must believe me.

28:11.000 --> 28:14.151
- Now you don't think she did it either.
- I'm not certain of that.

28:14.800 --> 28:16.631
It is possible that, in a panic,

28:16.720 --> 28:19.188
Miss Allen used her own
monogrammed handkerchief

28:19.280 --> 28:20.679
to wipe the evidence.

28:20.760 --> 28:23.797
But, then, to leave it half-burned
in her own fireplace?

28:24.400 --> 28:25.515
A frame-up?

28:26.800 --> 28:30.315
Sirs? Constable Worseley just telephoned
from the Jenkins' house to check in.

28:30.400 --> 28:32.391
I mentioned
this handkerchief business to him.

28:32.480 --> 28:34.869
He swears that he saw it
in the wastebasket

28:34.960 --> 28:36.552
in Percival Jenkins' bedroom.

28:36.640 --> 28:37.629
When was this?

28:37.720 --> 28:39.233
When he and I
first arrived at the house.

28:39.320 --> 28:41.515
- And he never mentioned it?
- He didn't want to disturb it, sir.

28:41.600 --> 28:43.352
He assumed we'd find it
during our research.

28:43.440 --> 28:47.115
But it wasn't there, George. We checked
the waste baskets after Dr Francis left.

28:47.200 --> 28:49.270
Who else was in that room
besides Worseley and Dr Francis?

28:49.360 --> 28:51.476
Just Detective Murdoch and myself.

28:51.560 --> 28:54.552
- And Heward, the butler.
- The butler has an ironclad alibi.

28:56.120 --> 28:57.633
<i>I'm very sorry, sir.</i>

28:59.960 --> 29:02.758
George, Billy Slater the footman.

29:08.600 --> 29:11.797
- You recognise this?
- Should I?

29:12.680 --> 29:14.830
I would have thought so, Mr Slater.

29:15.560 --> 29:19.553
We believe that the killer moved this
from Mr Jenkins' bedroom

29:19.640 --> 29:21.676
into Miss Allen's fireplace
to frame her.

29:23.680 --> 29:25.318
I'll take your word for it.

29:25.400 --> 29:29.393
One of my constables saw this
in the wastebasket in Mr Jenkins' room

29:29.480 --> 29:30.993
before I arrived there.

29:31.360 --> 29:34.796
Only you and Mr Heward
were in that room while we were there.

29:34.880 --> 29:39.556
Mr Heward has an alibi that rules him
out as the killer. That leaves only you.

29:40.960 --> 29:42.518
Why would I kill Mr Jenkins?

29:43.640 --> 29:46.950
Because he made sexual advances
toward your sweetheart Nancy Booth.

29:47.720 --> 29:51.076
- She's not my sweetheart.
- I saw the two of you linking hands.

29:54.680 --> 29:59.310
All right. I took the handkerchief, but
it weren't me that killed Mr Jenkins.

29:59.400 --> 30:01.356
Then why did you move evidence?

30:01.680 --> 30:05.559
I saw it there in the waste paper basket
and I said to myself,

30:06.040 --> 30:08.600
- "I'll get that old cow. "
- Miss Allen?

30:08.680 --> 30:11.513
You dislike her enough
to frame her for murder?

30:12.640 --> 30:15.154
I sincerely dislike her.

30:16.200 --> 30:18.270
- You've got Billy Slater in the cells?
- Yes.

30:18.360 --> 30:20.749
- But you don't think he's the killer?
- No.

30:20.840 --> 30:21.909
Go ahead.

30:23.160 --> 30:25.958
Consider, sir,
if Mr Slater is the killer

30:26.040 --> 30:27.758
and planned to frame Miss Allen

30:27.840 --> 30:29.637
with her monogrammed handkerchief,

30:29.720 --> 30:32.234
placing it in the wastebasket
would have done the trick.

30:32.320 --> 30:35.949
Why then move it from the wastebasket
to the fireplace in Miss Allen's room?

30:36.480 --> 30:38.311
- Why frame her twice?
- Exactly.

30:38.840 --> 30:41.752
He's a footman, Murdoch.
Not many geniuses in that line of work.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.796
I don't believe Mr Slater for a minute

30:43.880 --> 30:47.589
when he says he moved the evidence
out of a sincere dislike for Miss Allen.

30:49.520 --> 30:51.397
But if he's not the killer, as you say,

30:51.480 --> 30:53.232
he took an awfully big chance
to frame her.

30:53.320 --> 30:55.197
He gets caught with that bloody thing,
he could hang for that.

30:55.280 --> 30:57.999
So either Mr Slater is a reckless fool

30:58.080 --> 31:01.152
or he had motive for moving the evidence
that he hasn't admitted to.

31:01.440 --> 31:04.352
Why would Billy do such a thing?
I've never done him any wrong.

31:04.440 --> 31:07.034
Then perhaps you've wronged someone
Billy was partial to?

31:07.120 --> 31:08.155
No.

31:08.240 --> 31:12.279
- Nancy Booth comes to mind.
- I might have done.

31:14.760 --> 31:18.435
She's the reason I went to talk
to Mr Jenkins when I found him dead.

31:19.560 --> 31:23.189
- Nancy was proving to be unsuitable.
- Oh? How so?

31:24.120 --> 31:25.678
She wasn't doing her job properly.

31:28.720 --> 31:31.553
I've forgotten the cutlery.

31:36.760 --> 31:37.829
She's lying.

31:38.880 --> 31:43.351
There's no harder worker than Nancy. She
does whatever Miss Allen asks and more.

31:43.440 --> 31:45.590
Then why would she want
Nancy dismissed?

31:45.720 --> 31:47.711
Nancy wouldn't have been the first.

31:48.320 --> 31:51.596
From what I've heard, they've fired
more than a few girls over the years

31:51.680 --> 31:52.874
who have found themselves in trouble.

31:58.520 --> 32:02.399
Three months, I'd say.
Has your morning sickness subsided yet?

32:02.480 --> 32:04.948
- Mmm-hmm.
- Who is the father, Miss Booth?

32:06.880 --> 32:08.472
Was it Percival Jenkins?

32:12.040 --> 32:15.032
- And Miss Allen knew?
- Of course I knew.

32:16.640 --> 32:18.119
Nancy was sick in the mornings

32:18.240 --> 32:21.073
and looking fuller in the face,
weren't you, dear?

32:21.960 --> 32:24.679
I've seen that too many times
in this house not to recognise it.

32:24.760 --> 32:26.716
That's why you went to speak
to Percival Jenkins?

32:26.800 --> 32:27.994
You knew he was responsible?

32:28.080 --> 32:29.513
He certainly was not.

32:30.680 --> 32:33.877
Nancy is no better than all the other
dolly mops who paraded themselves

32:33.960 --> 32:35.837
in front of him all these years.

32:35.920 --> 32:39.071
Seducing him
with their glances and their smiles.

32:42.040 --> 32:47.114
These dolly mops, as you call them,
were coerced and made pregnant

32:47.200 --> 32:49.555
by a man you are so eager to defend,

32:49.640 --> 32:52.438
then thrown out onto the streets
with child by you!

32:53.280 --> 32:55.510
How many were there, hmm?

32:55.600 --> 32:57.352
What became of them?

33:06.680 --> 33:09.911
It appears that in the
Jenkins' household there is a history

33:10.000 --> 33:12.798
of young girls meeting this fate
as Nancy Booth.

33:13.280 --> 33:14.918
What options would such a girl have?

33:15.000 --> 33:18.197
Not many.
More than likely take to the streets.

33:19.040 --> 33:20.268
George!

33:21.520 --> 33:22.589
Sir?

33:22.680 --> 33:24.238
Find out what you can about young women

33:24.320 --> 33:26.834
that have been dismissed
from service in the Jenkins' household.

33:26.920 --> 33:29.878
- I'll make some inquiries.
- To what end, Murdoch?

33:29.960 --> 33:32.190
There's no law
against dismissing a pregnant maid.

33:32.280 --> 33:33.679
No justice to be found here.

33:33.760 --> 33:36.513
Except the one that would put a noose
around Nancy Booth's neck.

33:36.600 --> 33:38.750
- You think she did it?
- She certainly had motive.

33:38.840 --> 33:40.319
Her life was about to be destroyed.

33:40.400 --> 33:42.197
Scullery maids
don't normally go upstairs.

33:42.280 --> 33:43.599
She'd be taking a hell of a risk.

33:44.720 --> 33:47.439
Not if Billy Slater made sure
the coast was clear.

33:47.520 --> 33:50.671
He was serving tea at the time, he would
have known everyone's whereabouts.

33:50.760 --> 33:52.159
Why let Nancy do the old man in?

33:52.240 --> 33:54.470
And why let her walk
in full view of old Mrs Jenkins?

33:55.200 --> 33:56.269
They probably thought

33:56.360 --> 33:59.796
she was too senile and nearsighted
to be a reliable witness.

33:59.880 --> 34:00.915
Was she?

34:02.360 --> 34:05.033
<i>Mrs Jenkins has her moments of lucidity.</i>

34:06.080 --> 34:08.389
Sir, it's possible
that old Mrs Jenkins knows

34:08.480 --> 34:10.710
more than we've been led to believe.

34:12.520 --> 34:17.547
Ah, Detective Murdoch,
there's been a development.

34:32.480 --> 34:35.358
Yes. Thank you. Bye-bye.

34:36.920 --> 34:39.309
Well, you've got your wish.

34:39.400 --> 34:40.913
The College of Physicians and Surgeons

34:41.000 --> 34:44.072
is granting Dr Ogden special
dispensation, just for this case.

34:44.880 --> 34:47.792
- Excellent. Thank you, sir.
- You've got some cheek.

34:48.719 --> 34:51.473
Sir? Dr Ogden is calling for you
at the morgue.

34:52.159 --> 34:53.195
Very good.

34:53.280 --> 34:55.840
- It's only temporary, Murdoch.
- Yes, sir.

35:11.240 --> 35:13.276
Dr Ogden, what have you?

35:14.240 --> 35:18.119
Well, Detective, as I suspected,
Mrs Jenkins' heart did indeed give out.

35:18.640 --> 35:20.278
She died of natural causes?

35:20.360 --> 35:21.554
I thought so, initially,

35:21.640 --> 35:24.393
but then I found petechial haemorrhages
on the surface of the lungs.

35:24.840 --> 35:26.068
Asphyxiation?

35:26.160 --> 35:27.912
Well, usually in the case of smothering

35:28.000 --> 35:30.639
the haemorrhages appear
around the face and the eyes.

35:30.720 --> 35:33.029
But, with her age,
the trauma likely induced a heart attack

35:33.120 --> 35:34.917
before she actually suffocated.

35:35.760 --> 35:36.829
Murder then?

35:38.280 --> 35:40.874
Thank you, Doctor.
Excellent work, as usual.

35:40.960 --> 35:42.632
My pleasure, I'm sure.

35:43.520 --> 35:45.875
Murdered? Bloody marvellous.

35:48.400 --> 35:52.996
Actually, sir, assuming the same person
committed both murders,

35:53.080 --> 35:56.390
anyone lacking opportunity
to kill old Mrs Jenkins

35:56.480 --> 35:59.278
can be stricken off our list
for the first murder.

35:59.360 --> 36:01.920
Billy Slater was in our cells,
so he couldn't have done it.

36:03.160 --> 36:04.354
What have you, George?

36:04.440 --> 36:07.079
Sir, I've confirmed
that Nancy Booth and Miss Allen

36:07.160 --> 36:09.674
were in the kitchen at the time
of old Mrs Jenkins' death.

36:10.400 --> 36:13.198
Victor Jenkins was drinking in a pub.

36:13.280 --> 36:16.352
Nicholas and Clara Thorn were
in the library with Nora Jenkins

36:16.440 --> 36:17.953
discussing funeral arrangements.

36:20.560 --> 36:22.232
Leaving only Mr Heward.

36:22.320 --> 36:25.471
The butler is the only one with an alibi
for Percy Jenkins' murder.

36:25.560 --> 36:29.269
- This is a waste of chalk.
- My theory might be flawed.

36:29.360 --> 36:30.475
Really?

36:30.560 --> 36:33.950
Well, sir, also I obtained
the servant records from Nora Jenkins.

36:34.040 --> 36:35.996
Not without protest, I might add.

36:36.080 --> 36:37.911
But over the past twenty years or so,

36:38.040 --> 36:40.190
seven girls have been dismissed
from the household.

36:40.280 --> 36:41.429
On what grounds?

36:41.520 --> 36:47.311
Two for insubordination, two for poor
work habits and three for loose morals.

36:47.400 --> 36:50.915
Meaning they were pregnant.
Unfortunate, but irrelevant, Murdoch.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.797
I'm not so sure, sir.

36:52.880 --> 36:54.472
Have a look at the third name
on the list.

36:54.560 --> 36:58.235
Alma Parsons,
dismissed August 30th, 1876.

36:58.320 --> 37:02.552
<i>It was Alma! Has everyone gone stupid
except for me?</i>

37:03.000 --> 37:06.436
<i>I haven't seen this in I don't know
how long. Years.</i>

37:07.600 --> 37:10.034
George. Find out what's become
of Alma Parsons.

37:10.920 --> 37:11.955
Sir.

37:12.040 --> 37:13.712
Then I'm going to return
to the Jenkins' mansion.

37:13.800 --> 37:14.835
What's going on, Murdoch?

37:14.920 --> 37:17.434
Sir, I believe I know
who committed both murders.

37:27.240 --> 37:28.355
Good afternoon.

37:29.040 --> 37:32.510
I have asked you all here because
an arrest in these murders is at hand.

37:33.760 --> 37:38.072
Miss Allen, you told me
that it had been decades

37:38.160 --> 37:41.277
- since you last saw this.
- It's true, I swear it.

37:42.400 --> 37:44.789
What day, specifically,
did you last see it?

37:44.920 --> 37:46.114
What day?

37:48.040 --> 37:52.397
Could it be August 30th, 1876,
by any chance?

37:53.200 --> 37:58.479
- Do you recall what happened that day?
- But how would I? It was so long ago.

37:58.560 --> 37:59.595
Hmm.

38:01.080 --> 38:04.516
Alma Parsons, were she here,
would be able to tell you.

38:04.600 --> 38:09.435
Because, that day, Alma Parsons was
relieved of her duties at this house.

38:09.520 --> 38:14.150
- By you. Do you remember that?
- Yes.

38:16.080 --> 38:17.593
It was such a flood of tears.

38:19.360 --> 38:22.591
<i>I gave her the handkerchief
to mop up her face.</i>

38:23.280 --> 38:26.750
<i>I just couldn't have her leaving
this house in that state.</i>

38:28.080 --> 38:30.674
Do you know what became
of Alma Parsons, Miss Allen?

38:31.480 --> 38:34.472
I heard that she passed away
a couple of years ago.

38:34.560 --> 38:38.394
But I can't see that this has nothing
to do with a former servant girl.

38:38.480 --> 38:41.677
Well, Mrs Jenkins, Alma Parsons
was sent from this house

38:41.760 --> 38:44.957
for having the audacity
to become pregnant by your husband,

38:45.400 --> 38:46.958
very much against her will.

38:47.840 --> 38:51.310
Police reports from the day confirm
that Alma turned to prostitution

38:51.400 --> 38:53.914
so that she and her child could eat.

38:54.680 --> 38:57.035
That's what this has to do
with a former servant girl.

38:58.080 --> 39:00.435
Now old Mrs Jenkins was adamant

39:00.520 --> 39:02.909
that it was Alma she saw
walking down the hall.

39:03.920 --> 39:06.992
But her eyesight was too poor to make
out any detail from that distance,

39:07.560 --> 39:09.232
so why did she think she saw Alma?

39:10.200 --> 39:12.589
<i>We all know that we inherit
our physical appearance,</i>

39:12.680 --> 39:16.912
<i>as well as our mannerisms, the way
we speak, smile, the way we walk.</i>

39:18.280 --> 39:22.034
It wasn't Alma returning from the grave
to avenge the wrongs that she'd endured

39:22.120 --> 39:27.274
at the hand of your husband.
No, it was the child that Alma bore.

39:28.160 --> 39:31.470
And, by my count,
she would be 23 years old now.

39:34.600 --> 39:36.556
Isn't that right, Miss Thorn?

39:40.120 --> 39:41.997
This is absurd!
Clara is not a murderer.

39:42.080 --> 39:43.911
Sit down, Mr Jenkins.

39:46.240 --> 39:51.473
Miss Thorn, you never imagined that the
woman who was too blind and senile

39:51.560 --> 39:55.155
to even recognise you
would mistake you for your own mother.

39:57.080 --> 40:01.278
<i>Pretty, she was. Looked like a swan,
but walked like a duck.</i>

40:04.760 --> 40:07.354
I was in the morning room
with Nicky and his mother when she died.

40:08.200 --> 40:09.235
I didn't kill her.

40:09.320 --> 40:11.788
Yes, I know you didn't, but someone did.

40:13.080 --> 40:15.230
Someone who recognised you
as Alma's child

40:15.320 --> 40:17.470
the moment you walked in this house.

40:18.480 --> 40:23.679
Mr Heward, would it be correct to state
that you came to care for Miss Parsons

40:23.760 --> 40:26.957
- during the time that she was here?
- Yes, sir.

40:28.120 --> 40:29.189
Very deeply.

40:29.800 --> 40:33.156
And that's why you felt the sense of
responsibility to protect her daughter.

40:34.840 --> 40:39.038
<i>You'd overheard my instructions to dust
the fireplace pokers for finger marks.</i>

40:39.120 --> 40:41.076
<i>That's why you wiped down the ones
in the upstairs,</i>

40:41.160 --> 40:43.230
<i>not knowing which one Clara had used.</i>

40:44.000 --> 40:45.831
<i>Then when you and I witnessed that</i>

40:45.920 --> 40:48.673
<i>unpredictable moment of lucidity
from Mrs Jenkins,</i>

40:48.760 --> 40:52.196
<i>it must have occurred to you
that Clara's secret would never be safe.</i>

40:52.720 --> 40:56.349
So when I telephoned to say
I wanted to re-interview Mrs Jenkins,

40:57.440 --> 41:00.273
you killed her to ensure her silence.

41:04.160 --> 41:06.674
I'm sorry for all of it, Nicky.
I truly am.

41:12.400 --> 41:16.075
Come along. We mustn't keep
the detective waiting.

41:20.720 --> 41:22.392
You didn't have
to do this for me, Heward.

41:25.440 --> 41:27.431
On the contrary, Miss Clara.

41:39.360 --> 41:43.319
It revolted me,
what Mr Jenkins did to Alma.

41:44.720 --> 41:49.589
But we lived in such fear of him
and there seemed nothing to be done.

41:50.360 --> 41:53.796
- Nothing?
- Yes, I know.

41:55.080 --> 41:59.358
If I'd gone with her,
or helped in some other way...

42:00.840 --> 42:04.628
- Were you there the day Alma was let go?
- Yes.

42:07.520 --> 42:09.954
<i>Coward that I was, I stood mute.</i>

42:14.600 --> 42:17.876
The murder of an old woman is hardly
an act of bravery.

42:19.520 --> 42:23.672
She knew what her son was doing
to those poor girls all those years.

42:25.360 --> 42:27.874
She raised him into what he became.

42:28.720 --> 42:31.632
She gave the carnage he caused
not a second thought.

42:35.520 --> 42:39.433
In other words, Detective Murdoch,

42:41.560 --> 42:42.629
she deserved it.

42:45.160 --> 42:48.152
My mother kept that handkerchief
because she didn't want to forget.

42:48.840 --> 42:50.432
After she died, I swore I'd get revenge

42:50.520 --> 42:52.636
on those responsible
for the life she endured.

42:53.640 --> 42:55.471
So you hatched a plan.

42:57.080 --> 42:59.594
When I read Nicholas was at Harvard,
I moved to Boston,

43:00.160 --> 43:02.754
encountered him, by chance,

43:03.680 --> 43:05.636
and allowed him to pursue me.

43:07.240 --> 43:09.231
I genuinely came to care for him.

43:11.080 --> 43:15.073
Of all of them, he's the only one
that didn't deserve to be hurt.

43:15.480 --> 43:17.471
But that was the price
of keeping my promise.

43:17.600 --> 43:19.158
Constable.

43:32.520 --> 43:33.589
William?

43:37.960 --> 43:39.279
We've come to say goodbye.

43:40.280 --> 43:42.555
It may be some time
before we're in Toronto again.

43:43.440 --> 43:45.431
We still need a coroner, Julia.

43:45.520 --> 43:48.910
Are you certain I can't convince you to
extend your leave a little while longer

43:49.000 --> 43:50.911
until we find a suitable replacement?

43:51.000 --> 43:55.152
- I'm sorry.
- Julia, please answer me honestly.

43:55.560 --> 43:59.678
If it were possible, would you want
to come back here to this work?

44:00.240 --> 44:03.471
Darcy, my future is with you in Buffalo.

44:05.040 --> 44:08.874
You don't seem entirely happy there.
At least, not as happy as you seem here.

44:10.960 --> 44:13.952
The Victoria Hospital for Sick Children
here is one of the best in the world.

44:14.040 --> 44:17.669
They've approached me in the past
and I'm sure I could secure a position.

44:19.240 --> 44:21.435
But your home is in Buffalo.

44:21.520 --> 44:25.957
My home is wherever you are. And,
from what I've seen, you belong here.

44:29.200 --> 44:31.509
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely sure.

44:34.560 --> 44:38.155
In that case, I would love to stay on.

44:39.040 --> 44:42.555
I would have to apply for the job,
of course. There'd be a process.

44:42.640 --> 44:46.428
I'm certain the inspector would give you
a strong recommendation.

44:47.880 --> 44:52.874
Well, Detective. It appears we'll be
seeing a great deal more of each other.

44:52.960 --> 44:54.473
I look forward to it.
