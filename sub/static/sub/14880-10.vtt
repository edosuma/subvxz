I want you to do
high-security clearance

00:05.723 --> 00:06.756
on Simon Fischer.

00:06.824 --> 00:08.391
Get intimate enough

Nobody's ever guessed
my tattoo correctly.

00:12.063 --> 00:14.397
It was inspired by
the Keats poem <i>Bright Star.</i>

00:20.271 --> 00:22.038
I need you, Annie.

00:22.106 --> 00:23.907
I never need anyone.

00:23.975 --> 00:27.010
It was Lena.

00:27.078 --> 00:30.413
We need some help
over here!

00:30.481 --> 00:33.550
I want every possible way
out of D.C. sealed off.

I need to see her.

02:07.912 --> 02:10.981
I figured it out.

02:11.048 --> 02:12.282
So what the hell is
going on?

02:12.350 --> 02:14.017
Annie, you're supposed
to be recuperating.

02:14.085 --> 02:16.920
When Lena was in Nairobi,
there was an FSB operative there

02:16.988 --> 02:20.290
named Dmitri Larionov--
code name "Rachmaninoff."

02:20.358 --> 02:22.826
Not only because he was
a talented concert musician,

02:22.893 --> 02:25.028
but also because
he allegedly killed

02:25.096 --> 02:27.497
two rival assets
with piano wire.

02:27.565 --> 02:31.134
I went through all the cables
from Nairobi in '98,

02:31.202 --> 02:33.937
and there was one mention
of Rachmaninoff

02:34.005 --> 02:35.972
in Lena's correspondence
with Langley.

02:36.040 --> 02:37.807
Annie, you broke into
Lena's apartment.

02:37.875 --> 02:39.676
That's why you're here,
to explain that.

02:39.744 --> 02:41.044
Not to give us new theories.

02:41.112 --> 02:42.512
- Why not?
- Because Lena has already

02:42.580 --> 02:43.713
fled to Russia.

02:43.781 --> 02:45.148
We're fairly certain she's

02:45.216 --> 02:46.683
under the protection
of Russian authorities.

02:46.751 --> 02:48.151
Yes, I was gonna mention that
in my action plan.

02:48.219 --> 02:50.787
- Your action plan?
- There's a Dmitri Larionov

02:50.855 --> 02:53.123
currently living in Moscow's
Babushkinskaya district,

02:53.190 --> 02:54.691
working in a music store.

02:54.759 --> 02:56.459
I think that's Rachmaninoff.

02:56.527 --> 02:58.661
If I can get to Moscow,
I can covertly reach out to him

02:58.729 --> 03:01.097
for intel on Lena's location.
Annie, stop.

03:01.165 --> 03:03.400
I was in Nairobi
at the same time.

03:03.467 --> 03:05.068
Rachmaninoff was known
to all of us,

03:05.136 --> 03:08.104
and he was accused
of terrible things.

03:08.172 --> 03:09.939
If Dmitri Larionov is
the same man,

03:10.007 --> 03:11.508
that's not a reason
to go to Moscow,

03:11.575 --> 03:13.076
that's a reason
<i>not</i> to go to Moscow.

03:13.144 --> 03:14.577
You're not gonna
do anything?

03:14.645 --> 03:15.979
The Agency is vigorously
attempting

03:16.047 --> 03:17.247
to bring Lena to justice.

03:17.314 --> 03:19.349
What does that mean,
bring her to justice?

03:19.417 --> 03:20.483
Kill her.

03:20.551 --> 03:22.585
But Lena was smart.

03:22.653 --> 03:23.987
Lena <i>is</i> smart.

03:24.055 --> 03:25.355
She knew which operatives
were best suited

03:25.423 --> 03:26.589
to bring her in.

03:26.657 --> 03:27.791
And as we got them in,
she picked them off.

03:29.493 --> 03:32.095
Virtually all viable assets
we have in-country

03:32.163 --> 03:33.363
have been compromised.

03:33.431 --> 03:34.531
So what are we
gonna do?

03:34.598 --> 03:36.032
Our best course
of action right now

03:36.100 --> 03:37.600
is to pursue talks
between the State Department

03:37.668 --> 03:39.169
and Russia's Foreign Affairs
Ministry.

03:39.236 --> 03:41.971
So we're <i>talking,</i>
<i>not</i> <i>acting?</i>

03:42.039 --> 03:42.939
Annie, we're doing
all we can.

03:59.004 --> 04:01.539
Not bad.

04:01.607 --> 04:03.975
The jab is back, right?

04:04.043 --> 04:06.010
Right, Auggie?

04:06.078 --> 04:07.845
I heard about last night.

04:07.913 --> 04:10.648
I know from firsthand experience
what it's like

04:10.716 --> 04:12.650
to push too hard
after a trauma.

04:12.718 --> 04:14.485
I'm not.

04:14.553 --> 04:16.553
I am, but what's wrong
with wanting

04:16.622 --> 04:18.189
to get back on your feet?

04:18.257 --> 04:20.091
It's not just about your feet.
You lost someone.

04:20.159 --> 04:21.926
It's about your heart.

04:21.994 --> 04:24.896
I can feel you wanting
to get back into the field

04:24.963 --> 04:26.831
and make it right,
but it's not time.

04:26.899 --> 04:29.567
All I'm thinking about
is my footwork.

04:29.635 --> 04:31.369
Footwork's good.

04:31.437 --> 04:33.071
Breaking into
other people's houses

04:33.138 --> 04:35.406
is not so good.
Put 'em back up.

04:41.814 --> 04:44.048
Ah--

04:44.116 --> 04:47.018
You all right?

04:47.086 --> 04:50.922
I'm okay.
I'm okay.

05:10.876 --> 05:12.910
I was thinking about
our conversation earlier,

05:12.978 --> 05:15.680
and I realized you weren't
asking for permission.

05:15.748 --> 05:17.315
You were telling us
you were going to Russia.

05:17.382 --> 05:18.816
Yeah, I guess I was.

05:18.884 --> 05:22.687
I know what it means
to lose someone in the field.

05:22.755 --> 05:25.556
But it's dangerous
to use them as motivation.

05:25.624 --> 05:29.093
Joan, I have to go.

05:32.331 --> 05:36.567
Then I'll support it.

05:36.635 --> 05:40.004
But when you get to Russia,
carefully approach Larionov.

05:40.072 --> 05:41.706
See if he has any intel
that can lead to Lena.

05:41.774 --> 05:43.508
And if you locate her,

05:43.575 --> 05:44.876
you will take a photograph
of her,

05:44.943 --> 05:46.711
nothing more.

05:46.779 --> 05:47.712
This will be the proof
State needs

05:47.780 --> 05:49.680
to negotiate
her extradition.

05:49.748 --> 05:51.549
You will get the photo,

05:51.617 --> 05:53.618
and then you will come home.
I understand.

05:53.685 --> 05:56.387
You need to extract any
emotion out of the equation.

05:56.455 --> 05:58.556
You try to get payback,
you'll be on an island.

05:58.624 --> 06:00.124
Anything other than
waiting at the safe house

06:00.192 --> 06:02.527
or talking with Larionov
will put you at risk.

06:02.594 --> 06:04.629
You get caught
by Russian authorities,

06:04.696 --> 06:10.501
there's nothing the CIA
can do to help.

06:10.569 --> 06:12.236
We'll deny knowledge
of everything.

06:15.274 --> 06:18.509
One more thing.

06:18.577 --> 06:20.745
Lena knows you.

06:20.813 --> 06:22.547
She knows your tendencies,

06:22.614 --> 06:25.516
and she'll be expecting you
to come.

06:25.584 --> 06:27.018
And she's hoping your feelings
for Simon

06:27.085 --> 06:29.687
will cloud your judgment.

06:29.755 --> 06:32.056
Will they?

06:32.124 --> 06:34.592
No.

06:34.660 --> 06:40.198
Stay focused,
stay in your own lane...

06:40.265 --> 06:42.667
And stay safe.

07:11.476 --> 07:13.177
You figured it was better
if you didn't drive?

07:13.178 --> 07:15.279
"I'm just working
on my footwork."

07:20.118 --> 07:22.920
This is a plane ticket.

07:22.988 --> 07:25.389
And keys to the apartment
of one Pinja Stanis,

07:25.457 --> 07:27.391
former CIA asset.

07:27.459 --> 07:29.894
Former?

07:29.962 --> 07:31.362
Because she's dead,
Annie.

07:31.430 --> 07:34.465
This is the kind of mission
where every question you ask

07:34.533 --> 07:36.934
is gonna have
a scary answer.

07:37.002 --> 07:39.237
Due to the high-risk nature,
all contact with Langley

07:39.304 --> 07:40.438
has to be cut off.

07:40.506 --> 07:44.742
Now, even though
I disagree with all of this,

07:44.810 --> 07:48.779
I want you to know

07:48.847 --> 07:53.518
I am here for you
no matter what.

07:56.154 --> 07:59.924
That means so much
to me.

07:59.992 --> 08:02.860
I hope you know that.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.134
Glad we got that
out there.

08:10.202 --> 08:12.336
Have a nice trip.

08:12.404 --> 08:16.440
Auggie...

08:16.508 --> 08:19.310
could you just ride
out to the airport with me?

09:55.774 --> 09:57.074
"Welcome to Russia.

09:57.142 --> 09:59.243
"Thought you could use a little
walking-around money.

09:59.311 --> 10:01.979
Be safe. Auggie."

10:11.223 --> 10:14.759

Ah

Who are you?

16:20.125 --> 16:22.059
I came for you,
Rachmaninoff.

16:31.680 --> 16:34.305
I did a little digging
on Pinja Stanis.

16:34.759 --> 16:36.980
You lived the cover
pretty well,

16:36.981 --> 16:38.515
but she was left-handed.

16:38.583 --> 16:40.183
I was living left-handed.

16:40.251 --> 16:41.751
Not your playing.

16:41.819 --> 16:44.654
Your right was dominant.

16:44.722 --> 16:46.856
Why don't you tell me
what you're really here for?

16:46.924 --> 16:53.330
I want to talk about
Lena Smith.

16:53.397 --> 16:55.165
I don't know
who that is.

16:55.905 --> 16:57.906
Your eyes say differently.

16:57.973 --> 17:01.442
What did she do to you?

17:06.682 --> 17:10.018
I think you want
to talk about it.

17:12.186 --> 17:14.321
Dmitri, I can help.

17:17.893 --> 17:20.161
We met in Nairobi in '98,

17:20.229 --> 17:22.097
shortly after
the embassy bombing.

17:22.164 --> 17:25.099
I was a young agent,
cocky.

17:25.166 --> 17:27.102
I was sent
to search out Americans

17:27.169 --> 17:28.770
affected by the bombing,

17:28.838 --> 17:31.473
to play on their
vulnerabilities.

17:31.540 --> 17:36.678
She was brilliant.
A fantastic challenge.

17:36.746 --> 17:39.047
Fantastic in every way.

17:39.115 --> 17:40.949
I followed her to Prague.

17:41.016 --> 17:44.152
I would have followed her
anywhere.

17:44.220 --> 17:45.954
I thought I had turned her.

17:46.021 --> 17:47.689
How far from the truth.

17:47.757 --> 17:49.124
But she used me.

17:49.125 --> 17:50.726
She made a deal
with her superiors

17:50.818 --> 17:53.847
to bolster herself
as a double within the CIA.

17:54.244 --> 17:59.515
So I returned here,
my post, gone. My Lena, gone.

18:01.937 --> 18:04.906
I see sadness
in your eyes too.

18:04.974 --> 18:09.811
It's not sadness.
Anger.

18:09.879 --> 18:14.582
Lena was responsible.

18:14.650 --> 18:17.585
She took someone
from me.

18:17.653 --> 18:20.688
I came here for justice.

18:20.756 --> 18:25.760
Can you help me?

18:25.828 --> 18:28.263
When I spoke earlier
of small hands,

18:28.330 --> 18:32.700
I was speaking of myself,
of my own hands.

18:32.768 --> 18:37.705
Some people are destined
for small lives.

18:37.773 --> 18:41.176
My time with Lena
made me realize

18:41.243 --> 18:43.645
that I am such a person.

18:43.712 --> 18:46.047
I no longer travel
in the circles you need.

18:46.115 --> 18:48.483
I know no one.
I know nothing.

18:48.551 --> 18:49.617
I cannot help you get closure.

18:49.685 --> 18:51.386
I don't want closure.

18:51.453 --> 18:54.355
Once you're hurt,
you stay hurt.

18:54.423 --> 18:56.624
But that doesn't mean
you can't strike back.

18:56.692 --> 18:59.027
Please...

18:59.094 --> 19:00.829
Don't bother me again.

19:07.903 --> 19:09.637
So I talked to Charlie.

19:09.705 --> 19:11.739
He said the congressional brief
is looking solid.

19:11.807 --> 19:17.912
Just a couple of phrases
to go over with legal.

19:20.716 --> 19:24.686
What is it?

19:24.753 --> 19:27.188
I've allowed Annie
to travel to Russia

19:27.256 --> 19:29.208
to prove Lena's presence
in-country.

19:29.210 --> 19:29.878
What?

19:29.879 --> 19:32.347
And I provided her with funds
and an active cover.

19:33.195 --> 19:36.464
The Agency has suspended all
tactical missions on this front.

19:36.531 --> 19:39.567
I just gave the DCI my word,
literally this morning,

19:39.635 --> 19:40.968
that we were done with this.

19:41.036 --> 19:42.503
Arthur, she was gonna
go anyway.

19:42.571 --> 19:44.338
I just wanted to make sure
she did it safely.

19:44.406 --> 19:46.140
Is it gonna be safe?

19:46.208 --> 19:48.542
I don't know.

19:51.513 --> 19:53.981
I could fire you
for this.

19:54.049 --> 19:57.852
You know that, right?

19:57.919 --> 20:00.321
How's it gonna look
if she dies?

20:00.389 --> 20:03.591
How's it gonna look?

20:03.659 --> 20:06.427
I don't know,
but it will feel terrible.

20:20.509 --> 20:22.476
It's good to see you again.

20:22.544 --> 20:26.480
Zarya...
I knew your brother.

20:26.548 --> 20:28.482
I knew Simon.

20:30.485 --> 20:33.120
You are Annie?

20:33.188 --> 20:34.655
<i>The</i> Annie?

20:37.659 --> 20:42.229
Simon spoke of you...
many times.

20:42.297 --> 20:45.332
I'm so sorry about
what happened.

20:45.400 --> 20:48.069
The government doesn't
tell me anything.

20:48.136 --> 20:49.603
Only that he is gone.

20:49.671 --> 20:54.141
But I know it couldn't be
your fault.

20:54.209 --> 20:56.744
Not with the way
Simon spoke of you.

20:56.812 --> 20:59.480
Did you talk
to him often?

20:59.548 --> 21:01.082
He wasn't in Russia
very much,

21:01.149 --> 21:05.653
but he would call me.

21:05.721 --> 21:07.688
There was always something
in his voice, you know,

21:07.756 --> 21:10.357
like he wanted to talk more,

21:10.425 --> 21:13.461
but he didn't want to burden me
with his business

21:13.528 --> 21:15.396
and...his life.

21:15.464 --> 21:19.033
You were his bright star.

21:19.101 --> 21:21.135
You're the one he got
his tattoo for.

21:21.203 --> 21:22.436
Yes.

21:22.504 --> 21:25.773
My name, it means
"The morning star"

21:25.841 --> 21:27.875
in Russian.

21:27.943 --> 21:30.077
I always wanted
to guide him home.

21:35.550 --> 21:37.218
How was he...

21:37.285 --> 21:39.653
Simon, the last time
you saw him?

21:39.721 --> 21:43.491
Was he happy?

21:43.558 --> 21:46.427
Yeah.

21:46.495 --> 21:49.263
We were happy.

21:51.333 --> 21:53.834
I wish I had something
of his

21:53.902 --> 21:59.974
that I could return to you
or...

22:00.041 --> 22:02.710
You already have.

22:05.680 --> 22:09.784
Your doggedness is
no longer endearing.

22:09.851 --> 22:11.418
I was thinking about
what you said.

22:11.486 --> 22:15.422
And maybe some people are
destined for small things.

22:15.490 --> 22:19.360
But are you content to remain
so insignificant?

22:19.427 --> 22:22.029
Your FSB file says
your greatest skills

22:22.097 --> 22:24.765
as an operative
were your emotional intuition

22:24.833 --> 22:26.400
and your passion
for spycraft.

22:26.468 --> 22:28.803
That's what my file says, too,
about me.

22:28.870 --> 22:31.372
I know that
if I don't do this,

22:31.439 --> 22:33.240
I can't go on.

22:33.308 --> 22:35.743
Your Agency isn't
behind you, are they?

22:35.811 --> 22:38.579
Your being here is
unsanctioned.

22:38.647 --> 22:41.248
I came here for justice.

22:41.316 --> 22:44.285
Then get it without me.

22:44.352 --> 22:46.453
I can't.

22:46.521 --> 22:51.091
I could tell you something
empathetic to try and turn you--

22:51.159 --> 22:53.394
cultivate you like an asset,
stroke your ego--

22:53.461 --> 22:54.762
but you're too smart
for that.

22:54.830 --> 22:56.297
Here's the thing.

22:56.364 --> 22:58.399
The only reason
I care about you

22:58.466 --> 23:01.402
is because I think
you can help me.

23:01.469 --> 23:04.972
I'm here, Dmitri.
This is it.

23:05.040 --> 23:07.374
I may be the last spy
you ever talk to.

23:10.178 --> 23:12.079
There may be someone I know.

23:19.087 --> 23:21.722
The only one I keep in contact
with from the old days

23:21.790 --> 23:24.625
is Sergei.

23:24.693 --> 23:27.561
He worked counter-surveillance
for 15 years.

23:27.629 --> 23:31.031
When Prague went to hell,
my agency sacrificed me.

23:31.099 --> 23:34.134
He was the only one
who still talked to me.

23:34.202 --> 23:38.472
Speaking to him is going
to make him extremely nervous.

24:08.503 --> 24:12.406
Annie, don't do this.

24:13.575 --> 24:15.376
What is this?

24:15.443 --> 24:17.211
What are you looking for?

24:17.279 --> 24:20.547
Annie, stop.

24:20.615 --> 24:22.383
Sergei!
You come here?

24:22.450 --> 24:24.051
You come to me
to ask me for information

24:24.119 --> 24:26.353
and you pull this crazy shit?

24:26.421 --> 24:29.390
I'm the one who needs
to be nervous--me.

24:29.457 --> 24:32.426
You hear me?

24:32.494 --> 24:37.464
I don't care.

24:40.502 --> 24:42.970
I like her.

24:43.038 --> 24:45.973
I don't know why,
but I like her.

24:46.041 --> 24:49.043
You're about to like me
a lot more.

24:54.115 --> 24:57.551
Lena Smith.

24:57.619 --> 25:01.088
Where is she?

25:01.156 --> 25:02.423
I could be tried for treason.

25:02.490 --> 25:04.591
More likely, they'd throw you
in Pefortovo prison

25:04.659 --> 25:06.760
here in Moscow.

25:06.828 --> 25:08.862
More likely still,
I'd be put to death.

25:08.930 --> 25:10.831
Agreed.

25:14.836 --> 25:16.403
She's being kept
in a high-rise apartment

25:16.471 --> 25:19.440
in the Kudrinskaya Square
building.

25:19.507 --> 25:22.242
She lives in an ivory tower,
protected.

25:22.310 --> 25:24.044
Every Tuesday and Thursday,

25:24.112 --> 25:25.546
they pick her up
in a special car.

25:25.613 --> 25:28.449
They take her for a debrief
at Kubinka Airbase.

25:28.516 --> 25:30.684
She is like...a mole.

25:30.752 --> 25:33.087
She never sees
the light of day.

25:33.154 --> 25:35.956
She's definitely a mole.

25:38.193 --> 25:40.561
You'll never get to her.

25:42.931 --> 25:46.433
Nice to meet you too.

25:53.575 --> 25:55.743
I need a gun.

26:15.447 --> 26:16.959
The aim's not true.

26:16.960 --> 26:18.427
You have to account
for more recoil

26:18.494 --> 26:20.228
with these old pistols.

26:20.296 --> 26:21.730
It's an '83 Makarov.

26:21.798 --> 26:23.899
It's the best I could do
on such a short notice.

26:23.967 --> 26:29.104
It's mine, actually.

26:39.148 --> 26:40.716
You are injured?

26:40.783 --> 26:42.451
I'm fine.

26:42.518 --> 26:44.720
Let me see.

26:49.258 --> 26:50.692
Let me see.

27:03.039 --> 27:07.109
She hurt you more
than she hurt me.

27:07.176 --> 27:12.014
You should go home.

27:12.081 --> 27:13.649
Plan stays the same.

27:13.716 --> 27:18.020
Tomorrow we intercept the car
in Arbutskaya.

27:18.087 --> 27:20.656
I get the photo.
I go home.

27:20.723 --> 27:22.557
You are emotional.

27:22.625 --> 27:25.327
It's too dangerous
to work this way.

27:25.395 --> 27:29.031
Picture a time in your life
when you were happiest,

27:29.098 --> 27:31.033
when everything made sense.

27:31.100 --> 27:33.669
If you hadn't met Lena,
you might still be there.

27:33.736 --> 27:37.239
Trust me...

27:37.306 --> 27:39.508
no good can come from this.

27:39.575 --> 27:43.845
I'm not looking for good.

28:10.840 --> 28:14.710
I'm in position.
Do you read me?

28:14.777 --> 28:16.812
Loud and clear.

28:22.952 --> 28:24.686
Mercedes is coming to you.

28:24.754 --> 28:29.291
D548AP.

28:29.358 --> 28:30.792
Roger that.

28:30.860 --> 28:31.860
In five...

28:31.928 --> 28:33.128
four...

28:33.196 --> 28:34.329
three...

28:34.397 --> 28:35.697
two...

28:35.765 --> 28:38.200
one!
Go!

29:23.479 --> 29:26.081
Seth.
What are you doing here?

29:26.149 --> 29:27.916
Joan, I wanted
to make you aware

29:27.984 --> 29:29.718
that OIG has gotten wind

29:29.786 --> 29:32.454
of an unsanctioned
covert action in Moscow.

29:32.522 --> 29:35.891
A blonde woman ambushed
an FSB vehicle,

29:35.958 --> 29:36.925
and it didn't go well.

29:36.993 --> 29:38.593
Is the woman all right?

29:38.661 --> 29:40.929
Yeah. From what I hear,
she fled the scene unharmed.

29:40.997 --> 29:43.698
But...Joan, the Kremlin's
going ballistic on this.

29:43.766 --> 29:45.567
I mean, so is State.

29:45.635 --> 29:47.869
This kind of aggressive
bullshit has completely tanked

29:47.937 --> 29:50.238
the extradition talks
for Lena Smith.

29:50.306 --> 29:51.706
Shit.

29:51.774 --> 29:53.642
You know, rumor has it
that DCS was read-in on this.

29:53.709 --> 29:55.076
Is that true?

29:55.144 --> 29:56.578
Actually, you know what,
don't tell me.

29:56.646 --> 29:58.180
I can't have this
on the record.

29:58.247 --> 30:02.851
So off the record,
what do you think I should do?

30:02.919 --> 30:04.653
You need to prepare
a statement.

30:04.720 --> 30:06.655
I'm hearing
the word favoritism dropped.

30:06.722 --> 30:09.591
This isn't being looked at like
a clandestine service mission.

30:09.659 --> 30:11.726
What is it, then?

30:11.794 --> 30:13.094
A Joan and Arthur Campbell
mission.

30:13.162 --> 30:14.262
Seth.

30:14.330 --> 30:15.730
Look, after the murder
of Jai Wilcox

30:15.798 --> 30:16.898
and that whole Lena Smith
debacle,

30:16.966 --> 30:18.900
I mean, this might be it
for Arthur.

30:18.968 --> 30:22.737
I'm sorry, Joan.
No. Thank you for telling me.

30:22.805 --> 30:24.673
Okay.

30:25.741 --> 30:28.109
See you Tuesday?

30:28.177 --> 30:31.746
Yeah. Tuesday.
I'll see ya.

30:54.136 --> 30:55.871
What are you doing?

30:55.938 --> 30:58.874
I should be dead right now.

30:58.941 --> 31:01.610
So you need to start talking.

31:04.277 --> 31:06.987
The guy in the car,
hesitated.

31:07.177 --> 31:09.178
He didn't take the shot.

31:09.179 --> 31:10.879
That had to be on purpose.

31:10.946 --> 31:12.347
The FSB's better than that.

31:12.414 --> 31:15.617
You should've gone
when I told you to.

31:15.684 --> 31:17.352
Why?

31:17.419 --> 31:23.024
It started soon after
you approached me for lessons.

31:23.092 --> 31:25.860
After that,
I thought I was being watched.

31:25.928 --> 31:29.897
My skills were so rusty.
I couldn't trust my instincts.

31:29.965 --> 31:33.468
And then...she reappeared.

31:39.775 --> 31:42.977
And all the anger...

31:43.045 --> 31:46.114
all the passion
came flooding back.

32:06.602 --> 32:08.770
Pure emotion.

32:08.837 --> 32:11.706
I could feel again.

32:11.774 --> 32:13.308
And you fell for her again.

32:13.375 --> 32:15.810
You, more than anyone,

32:15.878 --> 32:19.113
should understand the power
of someone like her,

32:19.181 --> 32:21.716
how persuasive she can be.

32:21.784 --> 32:24.552
She's intoxicating.

32:24.620 --> 32:27.722
All these years,
I hated her.

32:27.790 --> 32:32.627
But then she came back,
and suddenly I mattered...

32:32.695 --> 32:34.128
again.

32:34.196 --> 32:37.799
Her idea to use the ambush

32:37.866 --> 32:41.736
to discredit you was genius.

32:41.804 --> 32:46.074
Even in my prime I couldn't
think that many moves ahead.

32:46.141 --> 32:49.577
Why didn't you kill me?

32:49.645 --> 32:51.446
Why didn't they kill me
at the ambush?

32:51.513 --> 32:53.581
Why don't you ask her
yourself?

32:53.649 --> 32:55.983
She wants you alive.

32:56.051 --> 32:59.687
She wants to see you.

32:59.755 --> 33:01.989
Where is she?

33:09.064 --> 33:11.966
Dmitri...

33:12.034 --> 33:14.702
where is she?

33:14.770 --> 33:17.372
Northwest of here.

33:17.439 --> 33:19.273
At a dacha...

33:19.341 --> 33:24.112
at Ilmen Lake.

33:30.185 --> 33:32.620
Goodbye, Dmitri.

33:50.672 --> 33:54.809
Good evening, Joan.

33:54.877 --> 33:59.347
That's my letter
of resignation.

34:01.750 --> 34:05.920
Thank you. I'll take it
under consideration.

34:05.988 --> 34:07.522
What'd you expect me to do,

34:07.589 --> 34:08.856
crumple it up and say,
"over my dead body"?

34:08.924 --> 34:10.757
I mean it, Arthur.

34:11.827 --> 34:14.262
I'll take it
under consideration.

34:33.681 --> 34:35.716
- Hi.
- Annie, listen to me.

34:35.784 --> 34:37.985
You need to get outta Russia.
You shouldn't be calling.

34:38.053 --> 34:39.786
I know
this is off-book,

34:39.855 --> 34:42.489
but your ambush damaged
State's negotiations

34:42.558 --> 34:43.858
and the Russians
are looking for you.

34:43.926 --> 34:45.693
The negotiations
were bullshit.

34:45.761 --> 34:48.228
I'm the only one who's acting.
Annie, please.

34:48.297 --> 34:49.730
You're a person of interest.

34:49.797 --> 34:51.565
Every moment
you remain in Russia

34:51.632 --> 34:52.900
is a moment too long.

34:52.967 --> 34:54.835
Now I can arrange
a water egress for you

34:54.902 --> 34:56.237
through the Black Sea.

34:56.304 --> 34:59.173
Use your resources and protocols
and get to Novorossiysk.

34:59.241 --> 35:01.309
I'm sorry.
I can't.

35:01.376 --> 35:04.011
Annie...

35:04.079 --> 35:06.714
Do you remember that moment
we talked about in the car,

35:06.782 --> 35:08.549
when you've gone too far?

35:08.617 --> 35:11.252
This is that moment.

35:11.320 --> 35:13.621
Now I need you to come home.

35:13.689 --> 35:16.757
And this isn't the Agency
calling, and I'm not Joan.

35:16.825 --> 35:22.730
There are things that I need
to say to you face to face.

35:22.798 --> 35:24.131
Important things.

35:27.369 --> 35:29.670
Please.

35:33.308 --> 35:36.611
I'll see you soon.

35:46.588 --> 35:48.523
You're leaving.

35:48.590 --> 35:51.559
Yeah.

37:14.710 --> 37:15.758
If you pull the trigger,

37:15.759 --> 37:18.394
you'll never know the truth
about Simon.

37:23.600 --> 37:25.067
What truth?

37:25.135 --> 37:27.403
Nice move with the decoy.

37:27.471 --> 37:29.038
That was a gear you never showed
when you were working for me--

37:29.106 --> 37:30.206
Stop stalling!

37:30.273 --> 37:32.775
Put your hands
where I can see them.

37:32.843 --> 37:34.143
What truth?

37:34.211 --> 37:39.281
Were Simon and I colleagues,
friend lovers?

37:39.349 --> 37:40.483
Were you?

37:40.550 --> 37:42.284
Truth is we never met
face to face.

37:42.352 --> 37:46.022
We both just worked for the same
mammoth Soviet spy service.

37:46.089 --> 37:50.359
I fed my intel to the Kremlin,
they fed it back to him.

37:50.427 --> 37:51.994
I just put the kettle on
for tea.

37:52.062 --> 37:53.195
Sit!

37:58.735 --> 38:01.003
Why did you pick him?

38:01.071 --> 38:02.972
Mysterious bad boy
with a clarity of purpose?

38:03.040 --> 38:04.707
Don't tell me
you don't have a type.

38:08.311 --> 38:10.012
You expected me to fall
in love with him?

38:10.080 --> 38:11.814
I did.

38:11.882 --> 38:15.818
What I didn't expect
was for him to fall for you.

38:15.886 --> 38:16.819
I mean, really.

38:16.887 --> 38:18.220
He was ready to drop everything

38:18.288 --> 38:19.922
and run away
to the Maldives with you.

38:20.505 --> 38:23.373
You're a better operative
than I thought.

38:23.441 --> 38:25.576
Is that why you picked me?

38:25.643 --> 38:27.878
I didn't pull off
being a double for 13 years

38:27.946 --> 38:29.413
without being opportunistic.

38:29.480 --> 38:31.815
Jai Wilcox was on to me,

38:31.883 --> 38:34.885
so I had Leo Brewer
take him out.

38:34.953 --> 38:36.386
I needed somebody
to take the fall,

38:36.454 --> 38:37.621
and there you were.

38:37.689 --> 38:41.925
Available, vulnerable,
ready to prove yourself.

38:41.993 --> 38:44.094
You still are.

38:44.162 --> 38:46.930
I like you, Annie.

38:46.998 --> 38:50.000
So I have an offer for you.

38:50.068 --> 38:52.536
Become me.

38:52.604 --> 38:53.604
Excuse me?

38:53.671 --> 38:56.173
You would make
an exquisite double

38:56.240 --> 38:57.374
within the CIA.

38:57.442 --> 39:00.510
No one would suspect you
and I would conspire

39:00.578 --> 39:01.845
after everything
we've been through.

39:01.913 --> 39:06.350
It would be audacious,
elegant.

39:06.417 --> 39:08.085
Just go back,
tell them you couldn't find me.

39:08.152 --> 39:10.387
We could establish dead-drops
within a year.

39:15.627 --> 39:19.296
So what...

39:19.364 --> 39:23.734
you want me to betray
my agency and my country?

39:23.801 --> 39:26.937
Why would I ever do that?

39:27.005 --> 39:30.440
For one thing,
you'd be incredibly rich.

39:30.508 --> 39:35.312
But mostly, I'd like you
to experience power.

39:35.380 --> 39:38.248
Real, true power.

39:38.316 --> 39:40.751
You'd be in control.

39:40.818 --> 39:42.819
Something I think
you're starting to realize

39:42.887 --> 39:45.155
will never happen
while you're in the CIA.

39:45.223 --> 39:47.991
You think you have power,
here, in the woods, alone?

39:48.059 --> 39:49.726
Yes.

39:49.794 --> 39:53.096
I had the power
to summon you to me, didn't I?

39:53.164 --> 39:55.732
And that kind of power
to compel people,

39:55.800 --> 39:59.269
to move the pieces--

39:59.337 --> 40:01.338
it's intoxicating.

40:01.406 --> 40:05.509
You're a traitor,
Lena.

40:05.576 --> 40:07.944
CIA, FSB.
America, Russia.

40:08.012 --> 40:09.613
These are all just words.

40:09.681 --> 40:11.581
The best spies
have always known

40:11.649 --> 40:13.016
that the sides can change.

40:13.084 --> 40:14.785
It's the game itself
that matters.

40:14.852 --> 40:16.053
I wanna show you this.

40:16.120 --> 40:17.788
You shot me!

40:17.855 --> 40:21.458
You're angry.

40:23.161 --> 40:25.362
I'm just gonna turn it off.
No!

40:25.430 --> 40:29.066
I've heard enough lies,
enough manipulation.

40:29.133 --> 40:33.470
If you think your desperate plea
is gonna work,

40:33.538 --> 40:36.373
you never really knew me.

40:36.441 --> 40:39.376
Okay, Annie.

40:39.444 --> 40:41.778
Pull the trigger.

40:41.846 --> 40:45.949
It'll be as if you're pulling
the trigger on yourself.

40:46.017 --> 40:47.317
You'll never make it
out of Russia.

40:47.385 --> 40:49.653
You'll be lucky to make it
to the other route.

40:49.721 --> 40:54.324
I'm sure gave you the whole "we
will deny any knowledge" speech.

40:54.392 --> 40:57.060
Pull the trigger and find out
just how true that is.

40:57.128 --> 41:00.664
They will hang you out to dry,

41:00.732 --> 41:03.633
leave you to rot.

41:03.701 --> 41:06.236
And the worst part is...

41:06.304 --> 41:09.106
You'll never be able to look
at yourself the same way again.

41:09.173 --> 41:13.443
You'll know that you killed
for malice.

41:13.511 --> 41:17.180
That changes you.
Go ahead, Annie.

41:17.248 --> 41:20.350
Pull the trigger.
