WEBVTT

00:00.240 --> 00:04.019
Please, don't try anything you about to see at home.

00:04.019 --> 00:06.060
We're what you call experts.

00:10.350 --> 00:12.710
On this episode of "Mythbusters,"

00:12.710 --> 00:13.890
Adam and Jamie --

00:13.890 --> 00:16.600
That is creepy and distasteful.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.110
But scientific.

00:18.110 --> 00:20.590
get the jump on a blockbuster --

00:20.590 --> 00:22.290
Blowing up, please.

00:23.710 --> 00:26.200
Can freezing a bomb hollywoodstyle --

00:26.200 --> 00:27.400
We're getting power --

00:27.400 --> 00:29.640
and taking cover in a bathtub

00:29.640 --> 00:30.810
And we go in 3, 2, 1...

00:30.810 --> 00:32.470
really save your life?

00:35.220 --> 00:37.640
Meanwhile, Kari, Tory, and Grant --

00:39.550 --> 00:41.790
fly by the seat of their pants.

00:41.800 --> 00:44.220
I don't think I've ever flown this close to another plane.

00:44.220 --> 00:46.910
Can flying like birds in a V formation --

00:46.910 --> 00:49.840
We're getting sucked in --

00:49.840 --> 00:51.650
save you fuel --

00:52.740 --> 00:54.380
Why are we doing this?

00:54.380 --> 00:56.180
and you money?

00:56.180 --> 00:59.110
There is a lot of sexy data we got going there.

00:59.110 --> 01:01.870
Sexy data, Not just the normal stuff.

01:04.730 --> 01:06.170
Who are the mythbusters?

01:07.200 --> 01:08.720
Adam Savage,

01:08.720 --> 01:10.030
It's scientific.

01:10.030 --> 01:11.540
and Jamie Hyneman.

01:11.540 --> 01:12.830
I'll be darned.

01:13.320 --> 01:17.200
Between them, more than 30 years of special-effects experience.

01:17.500 --> 01:19.160
Together with Kari Byron,

01:19.160 --> 01:20.720
I'm gonna wreck this car.

01:20.720 --> 01:21.910
Tory Belleci,

01:21.920 --> 01:23.530
We will have one shot at this.

01:23.530 --> 01:25.390
and Grant Imahara.

01:25.390 --> 01:26.740
I'm OK.

01:27.100 --> 01:29.270
They don't just tell the myths,

01:30.350 --> 01:32.730
They put them to the test.

01:38.760 --> 01:39.400
First up,

01:39.400 --> 01:42.610
Adam and Jamie have a tub-thumping jump.

01:44.030 --> 01:46.060
This is a story that is about literally

01:46.060 --> 01:48.060
almost kissing your ass good-bye.

01:50.890 --> 01:51.570
in the movie,

01:51.570 --> 01:54.290
Danny Glover sits on the toilet in his house

01:54.290 --> 01:56.910
for a regular constitutional and hears a click.

01:56.920 --> 01:58.820
When he looks down, he notices

01:58.820 --> 02:01.180
that his toilet's been rigged with a pressure switch

02:01.180 --> 02:04.080
that will set off a bomb the moment he stands up.

02:04.080 --> 02:04.850
Are you with me?

02:04.850 --> 02:06.480
Yeah. I haven't seen the movie.

02:06.480 --> 02:07.550
That doesn't surprise me.

02:07.550 --> 02:09.199
Anyway, he waits all night

02:09.199 --> 02:10.580
before getting the courage to call his partner,

02:10.580 --> 02:12.270
Mel Gibson, who shows up.

02:12.270 --> 02:14.840
And they contact this plan that they will leap

02:14.840 --> 02:16.860
from the toilet into the bathtub 

02:16.860 --> 02:18.420
for protection from the bomb.

02:18.420 --> 02:20.190
The bomb squad has this technique

02:20.190 --> 02:21.100
when they use in the film

02:21.110 --> 02:23.860
where they power liquid nitrogen on the bomb,

02:24.000 --> 02:27.070
slowing it down for "A few seconds,"

02:27.070 --> 02:29.730
which supposedly is enough time for Mel and Danny

02:29.740 --> 02:31.130
to get from the toilet into the bathtub

02:31.130 --> 02:32.930
covered with a bomb blanket

02:33.460 --> 02:35.140
and survive the blast.

02:36.270 --> 02:38.400
I like the fact that there are several parts to this story

02:38.400 --> 02:41.160
and the first is how fast can you get from

02:41.160 --> 02:42.410
the toilet into the tub.

02:42.410 --> 02:42.990
Yes.

02:42.990 --> 02:46.250
The second is, how much if at all could liquid nitrogen

02:46.250 --> 02:47.830
slow down the detonation of a bomb.

02:47.830 --> 02:50.120
And lastly, if you did get to the tub in time,

02:50.120 --> 02:52.380
would it and the bomb blanket protect you?

02:52.380 --> 02:53.230
Precisely.

02:53.230 --> 02:54.640
So let's start with the reaction time.

02:54.640 --> 02:57.150
We'll set up a toilet and bathtub and proper geometry 

02:57.150 --> 02:59.090
to see how fast it takes to get

02:59.090 --> 03:00.130
one from to the other.

03:00.130 --> 03:01.410
Works for me.

03:01.540 --> 03:04.890
So first, the guys will attempt lethal leaping.

03:04.890 --> 03:06.280
Found us a toilet.

03:06.280 --> 03:07.360
Good.

03:09.120 --> 03:09.940
And for that,

03:09.940 --> 03:14.610
they decide to precisely re-creat the scene of the crime.

03:15.910 --> 03:16.940
Oh, man.

03:16.940 --> 03:18.270
To replicate the bathroom,

03:18.270 --> 03:20.020
we're using the same kind of bath tub 

03:20.020 --> 03:21.330
that was used in the movie.

03:21.330 --> 03:24.460
An annoyingly large and heavy cast iron.

03:24.460 --> 03:25.960
The real deal.

03:26.140 --> 03:28.180
I've got to fit in there with you?

03:28.180 --> 03:29.780
Yeah, unfortunately.

03:29.850 --> 03:31.350
And we've got the same type of toilet,

03:31.350 --> 03:33.180
a one piece porcelain one.

03:33.180 --> 03:35.550
We'll place them the same distance apart

03:35.550 --> 03:36.740
like in the movie.

03:36.740 --> 03:38.210
We've even got a corner wall 

03:38.210 --> 03:41.210
so the every last thing is exactly the same.

03:41.790 --> 03:43.850
Everything matches exactly.

03:43.850 --> 03:47.540
But how will they time the jump from toilet to tub?

03:48.020 --> 03:49.590
While it's never explicitly stated,

03:49.590 --> 03:51.760
it's pretty obvious that the bomb in the movie 

03:51.760 --> 03:53.410
is triggered by a pressure switch 

03:53.410 --> 03:55.920
under the toilet seat which is convenient

03:55.920 --> 03:57.460
because we're going to use the same thing

03:57.460 --> 03:59.820
to trigger our timing runs.

03:59.950 --> 04:01.750
This little pressure switch right here.

04:01.750 --> 04:03.430
When we sit down on the toilet,

04:03.430 --> 04:05.710
we will compress the presser switch,

04:05.870 --> 04:07.530
and the system is armed.

04:07.530 --> 04:10.790
At that point when we get up from the toilet,

04:10.800 --> 04:12.440
the timer starts going

04:12.680 --> 04:15.220
until we're in the tub covered with the blanket.

04:15.220 --> 04:16.290
We'll film it on high speed.

04:16.290 --> 04:17.790
We'll be able to see exactly how many seconds

04:17.790 --> 04:21.010
it takes us to get there, and if that's enough.

04:21.180 --> 04:23.130
And with the final piece of the puzzle,

04:23.130 --> 04:26.610
a 30-pound bomb blanket like the one from the movie,

04:26.610 --> 04:29.920
the guys will just have to get up close and personal.

04:29.920 --> 04:30.460
Are you ready?

04:30.460 --> 04:31.040
All right.

04:31.040 --> 04:31.570
Ready --

04:31.570 --> 04:32.790
it's going to be three, two, one,

04:32.790 --> 04:34.320
- and then go. - Okay.

04:34.320 --> 04:36.870
Three, two, one.

04:42.570 --> 04:43.890
We got to do it one more time.

04:43.890 --> 04:45.500
I missed the blanket.

04:47.790 --> 04:51.010
That is really just creepy and distasteful.

04:51.010 --> 04:52.640
But scientific.

04:52.800 --> 04:54.410
Scientific indeed.

04:54.410 --> 04:56.770
All right, let's see how we did it.

04:56.910 --> 05:00.300
The jump is even more hilarious in slow motion.

05:00.740 --> 05:02.570
Your form is excellent.

05:02.570 --> 05:04.160
You're hugging the side -- 

05:04.360 --> 05:06.980
But it's clear that having Jamie stay low

05:06.980 --> 05:09.930
while Adam deals with the blanket is the right strategy.

05:09.940 --> 05:12.560
That is unbelievable.

05:12.560 --> 05:13.140
There we go.

05:13.140 --> 05:14.990
We are at two seconds and two guys 

05:14.990 --> 05:16.830
are fully covered in that bathtub.

05:16.830 --> 05:17.970
Nice work.

05:19.910 --> 05:20.720
Two seconds ain't bad,

05:20.720 --> 05:23.310
but to see if they can improve,

05:25.420 --> 05:26.740
the guys go for the best of three.

05:26.750 --> 05:29.770
Two, one, go -- 

05:31.410 --> 05:33.460
Hey, that was pretty darn good.

05:36.520 --> 05:38.630
I'm getting all bruised along this side.

05:38.630 --> 05:39.850
Me, too.

05:39.850 --> 05:41.010
Go!

05:41.580 --> 05:43.890
Jamie and I were able to get from the toilet

05:43.890 --> 05:47.710
to the bathtub in just under two seconds flat.

05:48.400 --> 05:49.690
Now the question is,

05:49.690 --> 05:53.350
will pouring liquid nitrogen on our bomb

05:53.350 --> 05:57.000
slow the detonation down by at least that amount of time?

05:57.000 --> 05:59.440
If it can, then it woult seem that

05:59.440 --> 06:01.600
Mel and Danny could get to the relative

06:01.600 --> 06:04.390
and possible safety of the bathtub in time.

06:04.390 --> 06:05.380
If it doesn't,

06:05.380 --> 06:07.630
then I guess they'd be vaporized.

06:07.640 --> 06:10.100
Either way, it's going to be awesome.

06:13.160 --> 06:16.510
Next, Kari,Tory, and Grant are winging it.

06:18.060 --> 06:19.110
So what's the myth?

06:19.110 --> 06:21.260
I'm sure you've seen birds flying in a V.

06:21.260 --> 06:21.850
Yeah. 

06:21.850 --> 06:23.560
Okey, we'll supposedly they do that

06:23.560 --> 06:25.330
because it's more energy efficient 

06:25.330 --> 06:26.320
which leads into our myth.

06:26.320 --> 06:27.910
If it works for birds,

06:27.910 --> 06:28.920
can it work for planes?

06:28.920 --> 06:31.430
So do you actually save fuel by flying in a V formation?

06:31.440 --> 06:31.950
Exactly.

06:31.950 --> 06:33.630
And more importantly, save money?

06:35.930 --> 06:38.290
Birds of a feather flock together

06:38.860 --> 06:41.210
and they also fly in V formations.

06:41.210 --> 06:43.680
But does that conserve energy?

06:43.680 --> 06:45.030
And if it does,

06:45.030 --> 06:46.900
is what's good for the goose

06:47.250 --> 06:48.720
also good for planes

06:48.730 --> 06:50.850
in the wide blue yonder?

06:52.230 --> 06:53.240
All right, I think the first thing

06:53.240 --> 06:54.760
we should do is go and talk to a bird expert.

06:54.760 --> 06:56.610
Let's find out if they actually do fly

06:56.610 --> 06:58.400
in a V formation because it's more energy efficient.

06:58.400 --> 07:00.700
Then we can get some small scale models of planes

07:00.700 --> 07:02.260
take them to NASA's water channel

07:02.260 --> 07:03.620
and see if they can do the same thing.

07:03.620 --> 07:05.080
Sounds like a great plan.

07:06.250 --> 07:07.910
It is a two-pronged plan.

07:07.910 --> 07:10.250
And to find out why birds fly in a V,

07:10.250 --> 07:11.280
Kari and Tory head to

07:11.280 --> 07:13.720
the Chrissy field bird sanctuary.

07:13.720 --> 07:15.020
Come on, Kari.

07:15.450 --> 07:16.350
I knew you were going do that.

07:16.350 --> 07:18.490
Where bird expert Peter Pyle

07:18.490 --> 07:21.140
can answer their feathery inquiries.

07:21.140 --> 07:25.420
Why is it you see birds flying in V formation?

07:25.420 --> 07:27.560
The bird behind the lead individual,

07:27.570 --> 07:30.130
all birds going back in the V,

07:30.130 --> 07:31.820
were save energy by flying

07:31.820 --> 07:35.280
within the vortices of wind the bird in front of them.

07:35.280 --> 07:38.010
Now, you are talking about "riding the vortex",

07:38.010 --> 07:38.900
what does that mean?

07:38.900 --> 07:41.450
Each bird as it flaps its wing

07:41.450 --> 07:44.360
creates a vortex behind that wing.

07:44.360 --> 07:46.050
And the vortex is created

07:46.050 --> 07:47.690
because there's a pressure differential

07:47.690 --> 07:50.160
between higher pressure below the wing

07:50.160 --> 07:51.930
and lower pressure above.

07:51.930 --> 07:55.930
And this creates an eddy that filters behind each wing.

07:55.930 --> 07:57.930
So, as a wing moves through air,

07:57.930 --> 08:00.360
it creates a wing tip vortex.

08:00.360 --> 08:04.150
These low-pressure spinning cones of air create upwash

08:04.150 --> 08:06.370
giving the bird behind a boost

08:06.370 --> 08:08.510
and making it easier to stay aloft.

08:08.510 --> 08:10.630
But do the birds save energy?

08:10.630 --> 08:13.010
Researchers studying this have filmed birds

08:13.010 --> 08:16.360
and have seen that the birds behind the lead bird

08:16.360 --> 08:18.230
will flap less deeply

08:18.240 --> 08:20.970
and flap less often than that lead bird will.

08:20.970 --> 08:24.000
That's the first clue that they're saving energy

08:24.000 --> 08:26.070
through flying in that formation.

08:26.070 --> 08:27.660
Okay, so less flapping means

08:27.660 --> 08:31.130
birds do save energy flying in the V formation,

08:31.130 --> 08:34.120
meaning Kari can start on stage two.

08:34.390 --> 08:36.580
Now, after talking it our bird expert,

08:36.580 --> 08:38.130
I'm starting to think this myth

08:38.130 --> 08:39.690
is looking really, really good.

08:39.690 --> 08:42.250
But birds are not aircraft.

08:42.250 --> 08:44.000
So I'm building a model airplane

08:44.000 --> 08:45.750
to take to NASA's water tunnel

08:45.750 --> 08:47.770
so I can see if flying in a flock formation

08:47.770 --> 08:49.360
has the same benefits

08:49.450 --> 08:51.940
for airplanes as it does for birds.

08:52.450 --> 08:54.630
Since planes don't flap their wings,

08:54.630 --> 08:56.610
the team will examine the aerodynamics

08:56.610 --> 08:58.600
behind a fixed wing aircraft.

08:59.590 --> 09:01.600
Sand it, paint it, put it in the tunnel.

09:01.620 --> 09:04.050
And after a luminous paint job,

09:04.050 --> 09:06.730
Kari's model is ready to strut its stuff.

09:06.740 --> 09:07.850
I love coming here.

09:07.850 --> 09:09.750
Water tunnel, good find.

09:10.580 --> 09:11.420
At NASA,

09:11.420 --> 09:12.940
Steve Smith is on hand to help

09:12.940 --> 09:16.430
figure out the aerodynamics of the V formation.

09:19.880 --> 09:21.410
Okay. Model's in place.

09:21.410 --> 09:23.280
All right. What are we going to see here?

09:24.000 --> 09:26.330
Let's go ahead and turn the dye flow on.

09:26.790 --> 09:30.370
I can start to see it like create kinda a tube.

09:30.370 --> 09:31.590
As the dye flows,

09:31.590 --> 09:33.800
it's clear that there is a vortex

09:33.800 --> 09:36.000
coming off the wing tip of the front plane.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.400
There's an upper motion from the spiral

09:38.400 --> 09:41.190
that's putting the following airplane in upwash.

09:41.190 --> 09:45.250
So being in the upwash of the vortex is creating lift

09:45.250 --> 09:47.290
and making it easier for the plane to fly.

09:47.290 --> 09:49.390
Therefore we having more fuel efficient?

09:49.390 --> 09:50.480
Exactly.

09:50.480 --> 09:53.660
Just like the aerodynamics of birds in a V formation,

09:53.660 --> 09:56.170
the fixed wing also creates a vortex

09:56.170 --> 09:57.370
behind its wing tip.

09:57.370 --> 09:59.890
And the resulting upwash makes it easier

09:59.890 --> 10:02.360
for the funnel plane to stay aloft.

10:02.730 --> 10:04.450
Now how far back could you be

10:04.450 --> 10:06.290
and still get the benefit?

10:06.290 --> 10:07.770
So the trailing vortex actually

10:07.770 --> 10:10.200
persist for a long ways downstream.

10:10.200 --> 10:11.540
In the case of jetliners,

10:11.540 --> 10:14.010
it lasts for miles downstream.

10:14.580 --> 10:16.470
And that's the proof of concept

10:16.480 --> 10:17.480
that the mythbusters need.

10:17.480 --> 10:19.560
Next step, to see if this model

10:19.560 --> 10:21.840
scales up to full-sized planes.

10:23.550 --> 10:25.030
Later, Adam and Jamie

10:25.030 --> 10:26.800
test the tub-thumping boom.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.170
This whole building, 

10:28.170 --> 10:30.570
I think it's gonna be pretty much gone when we're done.

10:30.570 --> 10:32.550
But first, Kari, Tory,

10:32.550 --> 10:34.340
and Grant are flying high.

10:34.340 --> 10:37.640
And we are off the ground.

10:37.920 --> 10:39.720
There's the liftoff!

10:44.560 --> 10:46.020
So, toilet bombs.

10:46.020 --> 10:47.640
We left this story with the plan

10:47.640 --> 10:49.310
to do some liquid nitrogen testing.

10:49.310 --> 10:50.570
But we're not, are we?

10:50.570 --> 10:51.430
No, we're not.

10:51.430 --> 10:53.480
Because we looked at the original footage

10:53.480 --> 10:55.460
and we missed some of the parameters.

10:55.460 --> 10:57.620
Neither of us were wearing bulletproof vests.

10:57.630 --> 10:58.590
Exactly.

10:58.590 --> 10:59.760
And I'm sorry to say,

10:59.760 --> 11:02.520
you weren't wearing your pants around your ankles.

11:02.520 --> 11:04.780
And I hadn't sat on the toilet for 12 hours.

11:04.780 --> 11:05.580
Exactly.

11:05.580 --> 11:08.010
So I think we need to do those tests again

11:08.010 --> 11:09.950
and see how they actually affect our time.

11:09.950 --> 11:11.220
I'm not going to have to sit on the toilet

11:11.220 --> 11:12.490
for 12 hours, am I?

11:12.490 --> 11:14.510
I can't imagine that we'll go all that way,

11:14.510 --> 11:15.630
but we should talk to an expert

11:15.630 --> 11:16.370
to make sure

11:16.370 --> 11:17.940
it's not too dangerous.

11:17.940 --> 11:19.600
Sounds like a plan to me.

11:19.990 --> 11:22.700
A marathon 12-hour toilet sit

11:22.700 --> 11:24.640
would limit blood flow to the legs

11:24.640 --> 11:27.620
and make the hero's jump harder to achieve.

11:27.620 --> 11:28.940
But is it even safe

11:28.940 --> 11:30.510
to attempt it?

11:31.000 --> 11:32.780
This is bulletproof vest, dude.

11:33.470 --> 11:34.740
To realize full accuracy,

11:34.740 --> 11:36.420
you'll also gonna need to

11:36.420 --> 11:38.430
pull your pants down around your ankles.

11:40.570 --> 11:41.630
Great.

11:42.350 --> 11:44.050
And to find out the maximum time that

11:44.050 --> 11:46.730
Jamie could remain on the throne,

11:46.730 --> 11:48.650
Adam sought out an expert.

11:50.140 --> 11:51.690
Jamie, here is your expert, Dr. Cho,

11:51.690 --> 11:53.200
he is a neurologist.

11:53.200 --> 11:54.410
Hi, doctor.

11:56.790 --> 11:59.150
So, doc, i have some questions.

11:59.150 --> 11:59.730
In the movie,

11:59.730 --> 12:01.990
Danny Glover sits on the toilet overnight,

12:01.990 --> 12:04.120
something like 12 hours, give or take.

12:04.120 --> 12:06.540
I was thinking maybe I'll sit on the toilet here

12:06.540 --> 12:08.780
for six or seven.

12:08.860 --> 12:10.900
Is there a problem with doing that?

12:10.900 --> 12:13.330
It is problematic mainly because

12:13.330 --> 12:14.070
you're actually

12:14.070 --> 12:16.900
creating mechanical pressure on the nerve,

12:16.900 --> 12:20.140
and in a long period of time it can damage the nerve

12:20.140 --> 12:22.980
and cause weakness and severe, severe pain.

12:22.980 --> 12:24.290
A minimal amount of time,

12:24.290 --> 12:26.390
maybe one to two hours, is

12:26.390 --> 12:29.270
probably where you should cut off the experiment.

12:29.270 --> 12:31.230
Okay, thanks, doc.

12:31.230 --> 12:32.880
Oh, you're very welcome.

12:33.490 --> 12:34.840
So it's only safe

12:34.840 --> 12:37.080
to sit for a maximum of two hours,

12:38.280 --> 12:39.200
which is good

12:39.200 --> 12:41.690
because the strain is starting to show.

12:42.050 --> 12:45.040
I've been sitting on the toilet about 26 minutes,

12:45.040 --> 12:48.340
and the first symptom has occurred.

12:48.340 --> 12:51.500
And that is that one foot, my left foot,

12:51.500 --> 12:52.960
is starting to tingle.

12:52.960 --> 12:55.190
It's -- it's a little numb.

12:55.190 --> 12:57.770
After a further hour of sitting it out,

12:57.770 --> 13:00.580
Jamie's legs are uncomfortably numb.

13:01.740 --> 13:03.070
All right, sir.

13:03.820 --> 13:06.640
I think we've got all the parameters in place.

13:07.450 --> 13:08.810
You feeling ready?

13:09.560 --> 13:10.760
let's do it.

13:12.350 --> 13:13.510
Here we go, buddy.

13:13.510 --> 13:17.850
One, two, three, lunge.

13:20.230 --> 13:21.110
Amazingly,

13:21.110 --> 13:23.950
even with numb legs and pants around ankles,

13:23.950 --> 13:26.910
the guys end up on the right side of the blanket.

13:28.110 --> 13:29.960
- Can I pull my pants up now?  - Yes.

13:29.960 --> 13:31.080
Camera off Jamie.

13:31.080 --> 13:32.440
Don't film him.

13:32.650 --> 13:33.770
Terrible.

13:33.770 --> 13:34.600
Surprisingly,

13:34.600 --> 13:36.960
the numb-legged jump was only marginally

13:36.960 --> 13:39.310
slower than their previous best time.

13:39.720 --> 13:40.930
I think it's a good test.

13:40.930 --> 13:43.620
I think two seconds is the target we want to hit.

13:44.920 --> 13:46.380
With all the parameters we see in the film,

13:46.380 --> 13:48.130
Jamie and I were able to dive to safety

13:48.130 --> 13:50.380
in just under two seconds flat.

13:50.380 --> 13:52.500
Which is a lot faster than I thought it would be

13:52.500 --> 13:54.060
when we started doing the testing.

13:54.060 --> 13:56.070
Now it all comes down to whether or not

13:56.070 --> 13:58.770
liquid nitrogen can slow the bomb's reaction down

13:58.770 --> 14:01.440
enough to give us that mythical few seconds

14:01.440 --> 14:03.680
that are explained in the film.

14:08.370 --> 14:10.920
Apparently flocks of migrating birds

14:10.920 --> 14:13.670
fly in v formation to save energy.

14:13.670 --> 14:15.210
But if birds do it,

14:15.210 --> 14:17.270
can planes do it, too?

14:17.970 --> 14:20.360
After their proof of concept test at NASA,

14:20.360 --> 14:23.080
the mythbusters are ready to take to the skies.

14:23.610 --> 14:25.670
So we've come to the Tracy airport to test the myth

14:25.670 --> 14:28.940
that flying in a v formation actually saves you fuel.

14:29.310 --> 14:31.440
What a beautiful day to fly.

14:32.560 --> 14:34.240
Let's conserve some fuel.

14:34.570 --> 14:36.980
Because this could be a significant savings,

14:36.980 --> 14:38.970
we've got not one, not two,

14:38.970 --> 14:42.520
not three, but nine planes.

14:42.940 --> 14:45.350
Nine planes and nine pilots,

14:45.350 --> 14:47.410
courtesy of the west coast ravens.

14:47.410 --> 14:50.450
Aerial acrobatics is their specialty.

14:52.730 --> 14:56.700
And the guy leading them is Tim Cohn, AKA Slick.

14:57.030 --> 14:59.020
All right, you'll be helping us fly in this formation

14:59.020 --> 15:00.520
to see if we can save fuel.

15:00.530 --> 15:01.200
Absolutely.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.510
How dangerous is that?

15:02.510 --> 15:04.550
It's a little more dangerous than normal formation flying.

15:04.550 --> 15:07.430
We get upside down in formations,

15:07.430 --> 15:09.150
but not in the wake turbulence.

15:09.150 --> 15:11.140
So adding wake turbulence is an element 

15:11.140 --> 15:12.620
we've been practicing a little bit.

15:12.620 --> 15:14.810
So hopefully everything will work all right.

15:14.920 --> 15:16.250
Hopefully is right.

15:16.250 --> 15:18.390
But it might be a bumpy right.

15:18.390 --> 15:21.050
We have nine planes flying in a random pattern

15:21.050 --> 15:22.370
at different altitudes.

15:22.380 --> 15:25.760
We'll establish a set speed of 110 knots.

15:25.760 --> 15:27.440
We're going to fly for ten minutes, 

15:27.450 --> 15:30.080
and every 30 seconds I'm going to write down a data point

15:30.090 --> 15:32.220
for their flow rate and to establish a baseline.

15:32.220 --> 15:34.650
And we can compare all the other results to it.

15:35.060 --> 15:37.990
First up, all nine planes will get airborne

15:37.990 --> 15:40.220
for a fuel consumption baseline.

15:40.370 --> 15:43.880
Feel the need, the need for data.

15:44.940 --> 15:48.280
The tray tables and seats in the landing positions.

15:49.050 --> 15:51.330
The planes taxi down the runway 

15:51.610 --> 15:53.780
and take off one after the other.

15:54.100 --> 15:57.270
And we are off the ground.

15:57.640 --> 15:59.360
There's the lift off.

15:59.540 --> 16:00.070
All right.

16:00.070 --> 16:03.330
Let's start the ten-minute clock now.

16:03.340 --> 16:05.980
Maybe 30 seconds I'm going to take down a data point.

16:06.390 --> 16:08.310
With the squad in random positions,

16:08.310 --> 16:10.650
maintaining a speed of 110 knots,

16:10.650 --> 16:13.300
the control test is off to a flying start.

16:13.910 --> 16:16.690
Flow rate holding around seven

16:16.750 --> 16:19.470
to 7.9 gallons per hour.

16:19.600 --> 16:21.630
This is a great control test.

16:21.930 --> 16:24.240
This is going to give us some juicy data.

16:24.240 --> 16:27.060
Yeah, you never heard that before, juicy data.

16:27.060 --> 16:28.290
Not just the normal stuff.

16:28.290 --> 16:30.940
There's a lot of sexy data we've got going here.

16:30.940 --> 16:34.370
Every 30 seconds, that sexy fuel flow is collected

16:34.370 --> 16:37.730
from each plane as they'll test against themselves,

16:37.730 --> 16:38.960
not the other plants.

16:38.960 --> 16:40.340
There's only a minute to go in the control test,

16:40.340 --> 16:41.830
we're getting the really consistent results.

16:41.830 --> 16:45.430
We're looking at 6.56 gallons per hour.

16:45.650 --> 16:48.390
And after ten minutes of non-formation flying,

16:48.390 --> 16:50.230
the test comes to an end.

16:50.840 --> 16:52.650
Copy that. Stop data logging.

16:52.730 --> 16:54.680
Okay, that completes our test.

16:56.460 --> 16:57.760
We made it!

16:58.700 --> 17:00.570
Nice flying, g-force.

17:00.830 --> 17:01.330
All right.

17:01.330 --> 17:03.590
Let's see if next time we can save some fuel.

17:04.119 --> 17:05.579
Back on solid ground,

17:05.579 --> 17:07.740
the results of the control are in.

17:08.069 --> 17:11.290
So with the control test and my plane cruising alone at 110 knots

17:11.290 --> 17:14.000
at an altitude of approximately 4,000 feet,

17:14.010 --> 17:15.930
as you can see on the ground,

17:15.930 --> 17:19.380
We get an average fuel consumption of 6.6 gallons per hour.

17:19.380 --> 17:21.760
And the data for the other planes is similar.

17:21.760 --> 17:22.990
Fuel rate varies,

17:22.990 --> 17:25.480
but what's key is that the formation results 

17:25.480 --> 17:29.300
for each plane will be compared against the baseline.

17:29.310 --> 17:31.150
Now it's time to try different formations

17:31.160 --> 17:33.130
and see if that makes a difference.

17:33.130 --> 17:34.130
Next up,

17:35.530 --> 17:39.880
Can freezing C4 creat enough delay to make a getaway?

17:39.890 --> 17:41.330
We're getting power.

17:46.840 --> 17:49.390
With the good cop sitting on a time bomb,

17:49.390 --> 17:51.600
it's down to some liquid nitrogen,

17:51.600 --> 17:54.940
a quick jump, a bathtub to save his life.

17:54.940 --> 17:57.620
Adam and Jamie have proved it takes two seconds 

17:57.620 --> 18:00.070
for two men to make the leap.

18:00.320 --> 18:02.820
Can pouring freezing liquid nitrogen

18:02.820 --> 18:07.520
onto a bomb create the two-second delay needed for a getaway?

18:08.390 --> 18:11.480
The guys are headed to the top of the range to find out.

18:12.110 --> 18:15.940
In the movie they pour liquid nitrogen on the bomb behind the toilet

18:15.940 --> 18:17.230
in order to slow it down

18:17.230 --> 18:20.180
and give themselves an extra few seconds.

18:20.240 --> 18:21.480
Now when we hear that statement,

18:21.480 --> 18:22.670
we figure that the liquid nitrogen

18:22.670 --> 18:25.400
could be acting in one of two ways.

18:25.500 --> 18:29.010
Either it is slowing down the C4's own reaction

18:29.010 --> 18:31.910
to blasting cap going off and delaying the explosion,

18:31.910 --> 18:34.840
or it's actually slowing down the chemical reaction

18:34.840 --> 18:36.460
within the batteries that initiate

18:36.460 --> 18:38.100
that blasting cap going off.

18:38.100 --> 18:38.810
Whichever it is,

18:38.810 --> 18:40.600
we're going to find out on the bomb range

18:40.600 --> 18:44.200
because we're going to try all those permutations right here.

18:44.830 --> 18:47.270
For that, Adam has built a disposable rig

18:47.270 --> 18:49.460
to pour liquid nitrogen on to the bomb.

18:49.460 --> 18:50.020
Perfect.

18:50.020 --> 18:53.200
But the trickiest part will be capturing the detonation delay.

18:53.200 --> 18:56.870
So the mythbusters' brain's trust has designed this.

18:57.170 --> 18:58.910
You set up the system whereby

18:58.910 --> 19:01.120
when I press these buttons --

19:01.120 --> 19:04.000
It sends power to this relay switch here.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.040
One leg this relay --

19:06.210 --> 19:08.930
instantly lights up this L.E.D. sign.

19:09.140 --> 19:11.360
Simultaneously the relay's other leg 

19:11.360 --> 19:14.160
sends power to this block of C4,

19:14.160 --> 19:16.110
enough power to detonate it.

19:16.110 --> 19:17.850
If there was any difference at all

19:17.850 --> 19:20.380
between the power impulse and the detonation,

19:20.380 --> 19:21.750
we should see it in the difference 

19:21.760 --> 19:23.360
between the lighting of that sign

19:23.360 --> 19:25.460
and the detonation of this explosive.

19:25.460 --> 19:28.610
And the first test of the system will be straight C4.

19:28.610 --> 19:30.990
To find the normal detonation delay.

19:31.890 --> 19:32.540
Okay.

19:32.540 --> 19:34.010
Arming the system.

19:34.010 --> 19:34.510
All right.

19:34.510 --> 19:37.190
This is straight C4 

19:37.190 --> 19:39.510
in three, two, one --

19:42.710 --> 19:43.500
That was lovely.

19:43.500 --> 19:45.010
That was really nice.

19:45.940 --> 19:47.370
Kind of a refreshing -- 

19:48.700 --> 19:50.740
Refreshingly explosive.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.070
But was there any kind of delay?

19:55.620 --> 19:57.780
It took ten frames between the light lighting up

19:57.780 --> 19:59.700
and the c4 smoke detectoring.

19:59.700 --> 20:01.670
Ten frames were shooting at 3,000 frames per second sorts,

20:01.670 --> 20:04.270
approximately 3.3 milliseconds 

20:04.270 --> 20:06.950
between initiation and detonation.

20:06.950 --> 20:09.400
Just over 0.003 second?

20:09.400 --> 20:10.390
Yeah.

20:11.030 --> 20:14.690
Three milliseconds is the standard delay.

20:14.700 --> 20:17.510
So now crack open the liquid nitrogen.

20:18.090 --> 20:19.430
This is what I imagined

20:19.430 --> 20:22.360
being a mad scientist was like as a child.

20:22.600 --> 20:23.960
With one cup in the flask

20:23.960 --> 20:26.700
and an identical piece of the c4 in the dish -- 

20:26.700 --> 20:28.200
- Ok, we're set. - We're ready.

20:28.200 --> 20:30.210
the guys retire to safety 

20:30.210 --> 20:32.740
where they wait the two minutes of the movie

20:32.740 --> 20:35.200
for the c4 to fully freeze.

20:37.130 --> 20:38.480
Okay. Here we go.

20:38.800 --> 20:42.020
In three, two, one, go!

20:47.020 --> 20:49.350
I heard stuff hitting.

20:50.180 --> 20:51.620
No delay either.

20:52.040 --> 20:52.740
No delay.

20:52.740 --> 20:53.320
really?

20:53.340 --> 20:55.120
well, I mean, maybe a few milliseconds,

20:55.120 --> 20:56.870
but I heard three, two, one, boom.

20:57.440 --> 21:01.490
I didn't hear three, two, one -- boom.

21:01.500 --> 21:03.940
Maybe not but perhaps the high-speed camera

21:03.940 --> 21:06.370
caught a freeze frame delay.

21:06.930 --> 21:08.810
46 frames.

21:09.380 --> 21:13.480
It's 4.5 times greater a delay when it was super,

21:13.480 --> 21:16.830
super cooled than when was just normal.

21:17.150 --> 21:20.070
It still wouldn't help you get into that bathtub, though.

21:20.070 --> 21:22.440
It's a pretty tiny difference.

21:22.860 --> 21:25.360
15 miliseconds is far

21:25.360 --> 21:27.860
from the mythical two-seconds delay of the film.

21:28.090 --> 21:29.360
So what's next?

21:29.610 --> 21:31.880
Now we're going to take a period-correct battery

21:31.880 --> 21:34.700
that's attached to our bomb that would absolutely ignite it.

21:34.700 --> 21:37.360
We're going to immerse that in the liquid nitrogen

21:37.370 --> 21:40.540
and see if that gives us the extra time that we're looking for.

21:40.600 --> 21:43.580
With one cup of liquid nitrogen in the flask,

21:44.210 --> 21:48.590
it's time for the '80s-style alkaline battery to chill out.

21:48.590 --> 21:49.780
It's immersed.

21:50.330 --> 21:52.070
With the battery immersed in minus

21:52.070 --> 21:54.060
300-degree liquid nitrogen,

21:54.060 --> 21:56.390
the guys wait the two munites of the film.

21:56.390 --> 22:00.630
This is battery and C4 immersed

22:00.630 --> 22:05.630
in liquid nitrogen in three, two, one, go.

22:07.320 --> 22:08.490
No boom.

22:10.480 --> 22:11.940
I'll hold it down again.

22:13.490 --> 22:14.970
We're getting power.

22:15.140 --> 22:16.220
The system is still working -- 

22:16.220 --> 22:17.640
the sign's lighting up.

22:18.150 --> 22:20.550
We seem to have inhibited the battery's ability

22:20.550 --> 22:22.190
to set off the blasting cap.

22:22.190 --> 22:24.590
It looks like the bomb has frozen up.

22:24.770 --> 22:27.360
But is there another reason it's not detonating?

22:27.360 --> 22:29.180
You're sure it's properly wired?

22:29.680 --> 22:32.390
We've got a bowl full of liquid nitrogen

22:32.390 --> 22:35.030
capped in C4 and a battery.

22:35.030 --> 22:36.190
We're just going to sit here and wait

22:36.190 --> 22:38.660
until the liquid nitrogen boils off,

22:38.730 --> 22:40.790
and then we're going to try and blow it up again.

22:41.240 --> 22:44.710
After 15 minutes the liquid nitrogen has evaporated.

22:44.710 --> 22:46.910
Now the moment of the truth of the myth

22:46.910 --> 22:49.360
is if the delay will still remain.

22:49.810 --> 22:51.210
Blowing up, please.

22:51.210 --> 22:55.500
In three, two, one -- 

22:59.760 --> 23:00.720
Nice!

23:00.730 --> 23:02.650
That worked beautifully!

23:06.430 --> 23:08.370
You know what that means for the movie --

23:08.370 --> 23:11.770
it means those guys could have just strolled right

23:11.770 --> 23:12.870
on out of that building.

23:12.870 --> 23:14.940
They didn't need to worry about the bathtub

23:14.940 --> 23:17.730
or bomb blankets or anything of that stuff.

23:17.730 --> 23:20.420
No, they got a lot more than a couple of extra seconds.

23:20.420 --> 23:23.440
They got an extra 15 minutes by my watch.

23:23.440 --> 23:26.800
And we wouldn't have had to get into the bathtub together either.

23:26.800 --> 23:28.870
I guess that experimentation was a waste.

23:30.820 --> 23:31.700
Not a waste,

23:31.700 --> 23:34.520
but at least you'll always have the high speeds.

23:35.220 --> 23:36.930
Well, it would appear that the "Lethal weapon two"

23:36.930 --> 23:39.030
bomb squad's technic for slowing down a bomb

23:39.030 --> 23:42.110
are more effective in reality than in the movie.

23:42.110 --> 23:43.350
When does that ever happen?

23:43.350 --> 23:45.390
I know. But we're not done yet.

23:45.390 --> 23:47.830
There are quite a few more pieces to this puzzle

23:47.830 --> 23:49.010
that we have to diss out.

23:49.010 --> 23:50.160
I know.

23:50.250 --> 23:51.520
Let's get to it.

23:51.800 --> 23:53.690
Coming up next, on Mythbustters

23:53.690 --> 23:55.980
we put real airplanes to the test to find out

23:55.980 --> 23:59.820
if flying in a v formation is going to save you fuel.

24:01.850 --> 24:05.570
Please do not try what you're about to see at home.

24:05.570 --> 24:07.110
We're what you call experts.

24:07.110 --> 24:08.480
Can you tell?

24:12.030 --> 24:14.210
All right, we are back.

24:14.220 --> 24:15.870
We're at Treacy airport

24:15.870 --> 24:17.530
testing whether flying in a v formation will save you fuel.

24:17.530 --> 24:19.340
We're not just going to test v formation,

24:19.340 --> 24:22.100
we're going to test flying abreast side by side

24:22.100 --> 24:23.290
and in a conga line to see 

24:23.410 --> 24:26.680
mabe if other formations might save you fuel.

24:26.890 --> 24:27.930
Just like the control test,

24:27.940 --> 24:30.600
we'll be flying in these formations for ten minutes.

24:30.600 --> 24:33.100
We'll monitor how much fuel is being used.

24:33.100 --> 24:33.690
Once we're done,

24:33.690 --> 24:36.150
we'll see which formation is the most efficient.

24:36.150 --> 24:37.060
Most importantly,

24:37.060 --> 24:37.920
to see whether or not

24:37.920 --> 24:40.440
flying in a V formation is the best way to go.

24:40.520 --> 24:43.750
This myth is all about the fuel efficiency of the V.

24:43.750 --> 24:47.120
But that's not the only formation that could save fuel.

24:47.160 --> 24:49.070
For a complete set of results,

24:49.070 --> 24:52.750
they'll also test the side by side and the conga line.

24:54.790 --> 24:56.660
But the first formation for our squad

24:56.660 --> 24:59.740
of nine planes is the mythical V.

25:00.950 --> 25:02.480
Now this is the dangerous parts

25:02.480 --> 25:05.260
as we move into V formation because, remember, 

25:05.290 --> 25:07.460
we are flying in the vortices

25:07.460 --> 25:09.500
of the airplane in front of us.

25:09.990 --> 25:13.590
All right, let's start the 10 minutes o'clock now.

25:13.590 --> 25:16.450
Flow rate is now 6.8.

25:16.990 --> 25:20.600
Right now each plane is in the other's sweet spot.

25:20.600 --> 25:22.960
That sounds creepy, but it's true.

25:23.110 --> 25:25.560
And that sweet spot just happens to be

25:25.590 --> 25:28.060
in the wing tip vortex of the plane in front.

25:28.060 --> 25:29.760
And will although it creates lift,

25:29.760 --> 25:32.250
it's also very unstable.

25:33.090 --> 25:35.970
We went a little bit too far in.

25:36.060 --> 25:39.610
And we started getting sucked in toward the leg.

25:40.270 --> 25:42.160
If you're too far out,

25:42.330 --> 25:44.250
yeah, you get no gait at all.

25:44.250 --> 25:46.860
It takes a lot of skill to stay out of trouble.

25:46.860 --> 25:49.540
The west coast ravens hold formation.

25:50.100 --> 25:51.070
I'm collecting data,

25:51.080 --> 25:52.920
it's a lot more fun from an airplane.

25:53.180 --> 25:54.220
There we go.

25:54.220 --> 25:55.710
Approaching seven minutes,

25:55.710 --> 25:59.540
and we've got 6.47 gallons per hour.

26:00.580 --> 26:03.390
After ten minutes, the test comes to an end.

26:03.800 --> 26:06.540
So we just finished the tight V formation.

26:06.580 --> 26:08.000
And looking at the numbers,

26:08.000 --> 26:11.540
it's already apparent that flying in a V formation

26:11.540 --> 26:15.160
saves you more fuel than flying without it.

26:16.040 --> 26:18.080
But the final fuel-efficiency results

26:18.080 --> 26:19.910
will stay up in the air

26:19.910 --> 26:21.550
because the squad moves straight

26:21.570 --> 26:23.700
into the side-by-side formation.

26:24.030 --> 26:27.980
OK, this test here is for the V side by side.

26:27.980 --> 26:29.500
we call shiver fred.

26:29.500 --> 26:32.180
That's basically wing tip to wing tip.

26:32.180 --> 26:36.750
No advancing or trying to get in front of like a V.

26:36.750 --> 26:39.140
This is basically side by side.

26:42.080 --> 26:43.370
There's some turbulence caused

26:43.370 --> 26:45.800
by the planes being so close together.

26:45.890 --> 26:48.690
I'm a little bit nervous about this one.

26:48.810 --> 26:51.610
I don't think I've ever flown this close to another plane.

26:51.980 --> 26:53.330
On purpose at least.

26:53.330 --> 26:56.970
Now in formation, the data collection begins again.

26:57.130 --> 26:57.670
All right.

26:57.700 --> 27:00.560
We are at about two minutes in,

27:00.560 --> 27:03.670
and we're using 6.18 gallons per hour.

27:04.210 --> 27:06.660
By being only 15 feet away from each other

27:06.660 --> 27:09.120
is challenging their concentration.

27:10.070 --> 27:12.120
Yeah. Data, had to take the data.

27:12.120 --> 27:15.490
I am breathing a little deeper just trying to calm down.

27:15.490 --> 27:17.570
But the fact that we are practically

27:17.570 --> 27:19.020
on top of each other side by side,

27:19.020 --> 27:21.390
it's freaking me out a little bit.

27:21.390 --> 27:24.170
Luckily, collecting data is distracting me.

27:24.390 --> 27:27.410
It's a heavy sense of data and danger.

27:27.410 --> 27:28.670
And after ten minutes,

27:28.680 --> 27:31.030
it's time for the final formation.

27:31.030 --> 27:32.800
Right now we are moving into position

27:32.800 --> 27:35.130
to set up for the conga line.

27:35.130 --> 27:37.800
I have the easy ride being in the front.

27:39.470 --> 27:42.960
I heard Tory and Grant have a little rougher time behind me.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.700
Yep, because as the planes take their places,

27:45.700 --> 27:49.210
it's clear this isn't going to be smooth sailing.

27:50.150 --> 27:52.640
We just ran from a nice, easy,

27:53.140 --> 27:58.000
smooth ride to a roller coaster ride.

27:59.240 --> 28:03.180
We're now flying flew the other planes'

28:04.150 --> 28:07.850
rotor wash, and it's very turbulent.

28:12.760 --> 28:15.080
It's a rotor wash roller coaster

28:15.080 --> 28:17.180
in the name of fuel efficiency.

28:17.310 --> 28:20.040
Two minutes in, we have 6.35 gallons.

28:20.130 --> 28:22.090
But the turbulence this test

28:22.090 --> 28:24.070
is making the others look tame.

28:24.070 --> 28:27.080
And I thought lying abreast was scary.

28:32.750 --> 28:34.580
Here's an interesting thing.

28:34.580 --> 28:37.360
The pilot in front of us is getting kicked out --

28:37.360 --> 28:39.590
when they get kicked out, so do we.

28:39.600 --> 28:42.340
Sort of a thing that you go all the way down the line,

28:42.340 --> 28:44.140
bang, bang, bang.

28:44.140 --> 28:45.520
Oh, my -- ah!

28:48.800 --> 28:51.010
I hate the conga line!

28:51.640 --> 28:53.500
Holy crap!

28:53.500 --> 28:55.340
Why are we doing this?

28:55.850 --> 28:58.050
This doesn't seem safe at all.

28:58.480 --> 29:01.700
Well, after the bumpiest ten minutes of their lives,

29:01.700 --> 29:04.400
the mythbusters can finally touch down.

29:06.270 --> 29:08.330
Hey, we are down.

29:08.820 --> 29:13.820
That concludes our conga line test, thank goodness.

29:14.470 --> 29:16.010
Back on terra firma,

29:16.020 --> 29:19.540
it's time to find out if any of the formations saved fuel.

29:20.600 --> 29:22.300
You guys ready to print some data?

29:22.300 --> 29:23.500
Oh, yes, sir.

29:24.360 --> 29:28.240
And after a bumper number crunch, the results are in.

29:28.310 --> 29:30.050
There is a lot of raw data.

29:30.050 --> 29:32.570
But the results from our planes tell the story.

29:32.570 --> 29:34.780
Now all the control baselines are roughly similar.

29:34.780 --> 29:37.590
But what's really interesting is the formation flying.

29:37.790 --> 29:38.810
In the conga line,

29:38.810 --> 29:43.110
the fuel use went way up, by as much as 18%.

29:43.640 --> 29:45.030
In the side by side,

29:45.030 --> 29:47.350
fuel usage was pretty much the same as control,

29:47.350 --> 29:49.010
maybe a fraction lower.

29:49.010 --> 29:51.000
But not significantly so.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.080
But then there's the V.

29:53.090 --> 29:55.470
Both my and Tory's plane saved fuel.

29:55.470 --> 29:59.550
We were at 5% and 3% more efficient than the baseline.

29:59.550 --> 30:01.820
But interestingly, even Kari's plane,

30:01.820 --> 30:04.640
which was the lead plane, saved fuel,

30:04.640 --> 30:07.350
which is what studies on birds have also reflected.

30:07.360 --> 30:08.610
And remember that all our tests

30:08.610 --> 30:11.480
performed at the same altitude and the same speed.

30:11.480 --> 30:14.090
So all our data is good and comparable.

30:14.090 --> 30:16.540
And good data is what it's all about.

30:16.540 --> 30:17.620
Good data,

30:17.620 --> 30:20.310
that can only lead to one conclusion.

30:20.360 --> 30:21.480
This myth is confirmed.

30:21.480 --> 30:23.210
We saw it work in theory in the water tunnel.

30:23.240 --> 30:25.130
We saw it work in practice in the air.

30:25.130 --> 30:28.250
Now 3% to 5% savings in fuel translates

30:28.250 --> 30:32.100
to a lot of money if you think about it in the long term.

30:33.380 --> 30:36.330
Flying in a V formation may save you fuel,

30:36.330 --> 30:38.010
but there's a flaw.

30:38.410 --> 30:40.790
Is it really practical that anyone would fly

30:40.790 --> 30:42.500
that close realistically?

30:42.500 --> 30:43.870
Maybe we should try it again,

30:43.870 --> 30:47.000
but this time have our spacing being a little safer.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.580
See, if you extend the V out further,

30:48.590 --> 30:50.870
if you still get that fuel efficiency.

30:50.870 --> 30:51.770
It would be a lot safer.

30:51.770 --> 30:52.790
Let's try it.

30:52.800 --> 30:53.730
Coming up next,

30:53.730 --> 30:56.690
the final flight formation takes wing.

30:56.690 --> 30:59.240
I definitely like science better when it's got a view.

31:04.690 --> 31:05.350
Welcome back.

31:05.360 --> 31:08.350
We've been investigating the bomb-proof bathtub buddy jump

31:08.350 --> 31:09.460
from "Lethal weapon two".

31:09.460 --> 31:10.730
And so far

31:10.730 --> 31:14.340
we've actully determined the techniques used by the boob swat

31:14.340 --> 31:17.350
in that film would give you plenty of time to get from the toilet

31:17.350 --> 31:20.930
inside the protection of the bathtub underneath the bomb blanket.

31:22.880 --> 31:23.970
Nice!

31:23.970 --> 31:25.780
That worked beautifully.

31:25.930 --> 31:27.650
Now it's time to figure out

31:27.650 --> 31:29.530
if once you're in that bathtub

31:29.530 --> 31:31.960
you could actually survive the blast.

31:31.960 --> 31:32.960
Behind me,

31:32.970 --> 31:34.820
Jaime is leveling a spot for

31:34.820 --> 31:38.640
putting in a real coded full-sized bathroom in

31:38.640 --> 31:40.540
and we're going to blow it up.

31:41.070 --> 31:44.250
It's the final part of this film make fable:

31:44.250 --> 31:45.530
survivability.

31:45.910 --> 31:48.380
We got the Hyneman in his natural habitat.

31:48.390 --> 31:50.360
Ensconced in his protective shell,

31:50.360 --> 31:53.770
he nests creating a hole for future Hyneman.

31:54.550 --> 31:56.390
He seems to have noticed us.

31:57.280 --> 31:58.850
Don't make a move.

31:59.380 --> 32:00.810
What do you think, is it level yet?

32:00.810 --> 32:01.920
Not even close.

32:01.920 --> 32:02.990
Okay.

32:04.770 --> 32:06.890
Without interaction went, without incident.

32:08.390 --> 32:09.200
Just remember,

32:09.200 --> 32:12.050
the Hyneman is just as afraid of you as you are of him.

32:12.770 --> 32:14.130
With the ground on the level,

32:14.130 --> 32:16.930
it's a simple job of bringing in the floor.

32:17.720 --> 32:18.820
Close enough?

32:18.900 --> 32:19.960
Close enough.

32:20.140 --> 32:21.430
Knocking up the walls.

32:23.210 --> 32:26.650
And hauling in buster with the all-important tub.

32:26.650 --> 32:27.640
Perfect.

32:27.640 --> 32:28.870
Here we go.

32:33.250 --> 32:35.870
Savage and Hyneman construction company.

32:36.650 --> 32:38.080
They're building to code,

32:38.080 --> 32:40.640
but just like all mythbusters construction project,

32:40.640 --> 32:43.420
the ultimate fate is detonation.

32:44.370 --> 32:47.060
Our little disposable outhouse is almost done.

32:47.290 --> 32:49.360
Not quite. I think it needs a coat of paint.

32:49.390 --> 32:49.910
Perfect.

32:49.910 --> 32:50.910
Let's do it.

32:51.800 --> 32:54.790
You might say it's a box standard job.

32:55.000 --> 32:55.650
I know.

32:55.650 --> 32:56.800
The worst painting job ever.

32:56.810 --> 32:58.850
If I were hiring me to do this,

32:58.850 --> 33:00.750
I'd ask me for my money back.

33:00.950 --> 33:04.270
Once it's complete, they can bring in the can.

33:05.830 --> 33:07.270
That feels about right.

33:07.270 --> 33:08.960
With the layout matching the movie,

33:08.960 --> 33:12.700
it's time for their experimental apparatus to join the John.

33:12.700 --> 33:14.400
I'm about to drill a hole in this bathtub

33:14.400 --> 33:15.990
for our instrumentation.

33:15.990 --> 33:17.430
The technical term for this drill bit 

33:17.430 --> 33:19.860
is big honking drill bit.

33:19.860 --> 33:23.730
That makes a big honking hole in the cast iron.

33:24.080 --> 33:25.200
Here we go.

33:25.600 --> 33:27.340
This is the plug I just drilled out

33:27.340 --> 33:30.190
of the bathtub for our sensing equipment

33:30.200 --> 33:32.460
to find out if our dudes would actually survive this blast.

33:32.470 --> 33:35.160
And I noticed something particular about it which is,

33:35.160 --> 33:36.670
it's a lot of cast iron.

33:36.670 --> 33:38.330
A lot of cast iron in the way

33:38.510 --> 33:40.620
between our guys and the blast,

33:40.620 --> 33:43.540
and it's kind of an ideal angle.

33:43.540 --> 33:45.980
I am starting to feel cautiously optimistic

33:45.980 --> 33:48.510
that this blast might be survivable.

33:48.810 --> 33:50.160
Adam's optimistic.

33:50.160 --> 33:52.700
But to precisely monitor survivlability,

33:52.780 --> 33:54.180
They've got this.

33:54.210 --> 33:56.670
I'm gonna stall this pipe cap right here

33:56.670 --> 33:58.510
in the hole of bottom of the tub.

33:58.510 --> 34:01.500
Inside it are actully two sensors.

34:01.500 --> 34:04.130
These sensors will give us the pressure readings

34:04.130 --> 34:06.320
and let us know whether our movie heroes 

34:06.320 --> 34:09.340
actually survived the blast in this tub.

34:09.820 --> 34:11.050
And for a comparison,

34:11.050 --> 34:12.880
Adam fits a twin set of sensors

34:12.880 --> 34:14.590
on the outside of the bath.

34:15.130 --> 34:16.850
All right. Sensors are in.

34:16.920 --> 34:19.330
Then Jamie adds his finishing touches

34:19.330 --> 34:21.610
to their bathroom bomb backdrop.

34:22.219 --> 34:25.840
Water is very good at absorbing energy.

34:26.280 --> 34:29.480
Yep, soon it will look like a bomb has hit it.

34:29.480 --> 34:31.050
Bon voyage.

34:34.130 --> 34:35.650
Now it looks right.

34:39.530 --> 34:40.719
Is it a bird?

34:40.780 --> 34:41.840
Is it a plane?

34:41.840 --> 34:44.600
No, it's the mythbusters in planes

34:44.600 --> 34:46.460
flying like birds.

34:47.020 --> 34:49.639
I definitely like science better when it's got a view.

34:50.170 --> 34:51.940
With the V formation confirmed,

34:51.940 --> 34:54.130
the mythbusters are taking to the air

34:54.130 --> 34:57.540
for their twist on this fuel-efficient formation.

34:57.930 --> 35:00.480
We are setting up for what we're calling "the extended V".

35:00.480 --> 35:03.580
This is like the type V with one major difference.

35:03.580 --> 35:06.160
Instead of being one plane length from the leader,

35:06.160 --> 35:08.750
you'll be ten plane lengths away.

35:08.750 --> 35:10.800
Based on our results in the water channel,

35:10.800 --> 35:13.240
we should see some sort of difference.

35:13.240 --> 35:15.600
We'll see if that translates into the practical world.

35:16.100 --> 35:18.570
This is a more real-world scenario.

35:18.570 --> 35:22.050
The tight V is far too dangerous for normal aircraft.

35:22.050 --> 35:24.410
But will increasing the distance of the V

35:24.410 --> 35:26.770
still benefit fuel efficiency?

35:26.770 --> 35:28.570
We're about 200 feet from the plane

35:28.570 --> 35:30.710
in front of us and the plane behind us.

35:30.710 --> 35:31.800
Being this far away,

35:31.800 --> 35:34.320
it's hard to find that sweet spot.

35:34.320 --> 35:37.290
All the squad found out into extend positions,

35:37.290 --> 35:39.250
and the clock starts once more.

35:39.490 --> 35:41.870
The interesting thing out here

35:41.920 --> 35:44.330
is that even though theoretically

35:45.060 --> 35:47.240
you should have the same effect,

35:47.240 --> 35:49.800
I don't feel like we're flying through someone's wave.

35:49.800 --> 35:51.260
It's pretty smooth.

35:51.550 --> 35:53.080
Being in the vortex in the long V formation

35:53.180 --> 35:55.180
isn't as noticeable.

35:55.180 --> 35:57.130
But you can tell the pilots

35:57.140 --> 36:00.280
have to make a lot of adjustments to stay here.

36:00.360 --> 36:01.080
Maybe.

36:01.080 --> 36:04.390
But when it comes to applying it to fleets of passenger jets,

36:04.400 --> 36:07.040
this could be a more practical formation.

36:07.900 --> 36:10.870
I'm noticing a little bit more of a variation in the numbers.

36:10.870 --> 36:12.790
They were more consistent with the tight V.

36:12.790 --> 36:13.760
I'm thinking it's a lot harder

36:13.760 --> 36:16.060
to stay in the sweet spot when you're in the extended V.

36:16.060 --> 36:17.420
It's harder to find it.

36:17.490 --> 36:19.760
After ten minutes of data logging,

36:19.760 --> 36:23.080
the Mythbusters can bring the myth in for a landing.

36:23.540 --> 36:25.510
That will conclude your in-flight entertainment

36:25.520 --> 36:27.340
on Mythbuster-Air.

36:27.340 --> 36:28.990
We know you have a choice for travels

36:28.990 --> 36:31.740
so thank you for flying with Mythbust-Air.

36:33.420 --> 36:34.250
All right.

36:34.270 --> 36:37.630
Extended V formation -- how did you guys do?

36:37.630 --> 36:40.240
Well, you know what? I actually saved fuel.

36:40.240 --> 36:42.730
Even ten aeroplane length back

36:42.730 --> 36:45.630
I was able to benefit from the sweet spot.

36:45.630 --> 36:48.860
In the extended V, I didn't see any savings whatsoever.

36:48.940 --> 36:51.060
But, you know, i suspect it's from being all the way

36:51.060 --> 36:52.280
at the end of the pack.

36:52.280 --> 36:54.070
It's just so hard to keep compensating

36:54.070 --> 36:55.970
and trying to find the sweet spot.

36:55.970 --> 36:58.150
Kari, you as the plane in the lead,

36:58.150 --> 36:58.920
how did you do?

36:58.920 --> 37:01.150
Well, unlike the really tight V formation 

37:01.150 --> 37:04.540
in the loose formation, I did not get any savings.

37:04.540 --> 37:05.500
But honestly,

37:05.500 --> 37:08.300
I still think this myth is confirmed for the loose V formation.

37:08.300 --> 37:11.910
If there's even a little savings for the following planes,

37:11.910 --> 37:15.600
in a large scale that translates to a lot of money.

37:15.600 --> 37:17.170
This might be the way to fly in the future.

37:17.180 --> 37:18.390
It's confirmed.

37:21.210 --> 37:22.660
After the break: freeze!

37:22.670 --> 37:24.160
It's rub-a-dub-dub,

37:24.670 --> 37:26.750
will buster survive in the tub?

37:33.930 --> 37:35.060
Down on the range,

37:35.060 --> 37:38.130
the mythbusters are prepping for the bathroom boom.

37:38.130 --> 37:39.260
We are almost here,

37:39.260 --> 37:41.210
and here's how this experiment is going to play out.

37:41.210 --> 37:43.020
Our bomb will be placed exactly 

37:43.140 --> 37:44.520
where it is placed in the film --

37:44.520 --> 37:47.520
directly behind the toilet on the ground.

37:47.540 --> 37:49.830
Buster will be inside the cast iron tub

37:49.830 --> 37:51.850
exactly the same geometry as in the movie,

37:51.850 --> 37:53.890
and he will be covered by

37:55.400 --> 37:56.640
an actual bombproof blanket.

37:56.650 --> 37:57.960
Underneath this blanket

37:57.960 --> 38:02.450
are two pairs of PCB pressure transducers.

38:02.450 --> 38:04.370
And the signal from the centers will be coming

38:04.370 --> 38:06.760
through wires that go into this pipe

38:06.820 --> 38:09.580
and are buried in the ground for their protection.

38:10.110 --> 38:13.320
And then picked up by this data acquisition center,

38:13.510 --> 38:16.760
which will take a signal and send it through that wire.

38:16.760 --> 38:20.440
And ends up here where our trusty David Harding,

38:20.440 --> 38:23.250
who will receive those electrical signals as data

38:23.250 --> 38:24.670
and tell us once and for all

38:24.720 --> 38:27.450
whether buster and the tub survive the blast.

38:27.450 --> 38:28.600
Pretty cool, huh?

38:28.600 --> 38:29.640
Pretty cool.

38:29.640 --> 38:32.750
And the last piece this "Lethal Weapon" myth

38:32.770 --> 38:34.790
is the lethal weapon itself.

38:35.120 --> 38:38.300
Might make the outhouse more out than the house,

38:38.300 --> 38:41.670
but it's the same amount of C4 as the bomb in the movie.

38:42.270 --> 38:43.340
We are going to try and find out

38:43.450 --> 38:45.930
if buster would survive in that cast iron bathtub

38:46.040 --> 38:47.720
protected by the bomb blanket.

38:47.730 --> 38:50.640
Inside the tub, our PCB pressure transducers

38:50.740 --> 38:53.260
are going to give us mighty fine reading.

38:53.260 --> 38:56.050
They should be able to tell us whether buster's dead

38:56.050 --> 38:58.130
or merely severely injured

38:58.130 --> 39:01.200
or maybe just had his eardrums blown out.

39:02.040 --> 39:04.660
This is the last piece of the mythical puzzle.

39:04.660 --> 39:06.050
Will the bathtub and bomb blanket

39:06.070 --> 39:08.820
protect buster from the blast?

39:10.870 --> 39:12.350
With everything in position,

39:12.350 --> 39:15.290
the guys retreat to the bunker for the final countdown.

39:15.290 --> 39:19.800
This is the "Lethal Weapon Two" Bathtub Blast.

39:20.610 --> 39:21.850
Charging.

39:21.870 --> 39:26.290
Ready to go in three, two, one -- 

39:28.000 --> 39:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

39:35.620 --> 39:39.100
Look, I can see the tub is still there in one piece.

39:41.750 --> 39:43.940
But nothing else --

39:44.510 --> 39:46.260
No, the room is gone.

39:46.320 --> 39:47.550
Really gone.

39:51.000 --> 39:55.350
There's no doubt that one kilo of C4 took out the room.

39:57.180 --> 39:58.910
However, the cast iron bathtub

39:59.000 --> 40:01.510
seems to be made of tougher stuff.

40:02.880 --> 40:04.330
The tub is fine.

40:05.220 --> 40:08.300
Our sensors are also intact which is really nice.

40:08.300 --> 40:10.720
There's no sign of the toilet whatsoever.

40:10.720 --> 40:13.420
I found the toilet seat and the toilet mechanism.

40:13.420 --> 40:15.390
But as far as the actual toilet --

40:15.390 --> 40:19.590
- Yeah, there's like, little bits of ceramic - Oh, yeah.

40:21.180 --> 40:21.890
Shall we check with David

40:21.900 --> 40:23.590
and see what the data says?

40:23.730 --> 40:26.330
I don't think there's anything else left to do here.

40:26.330 --> 40:27.380
No.

40:28.160 --> 40:29.340
Hey, David?

40:29.590 --> 40:30.830
What have we got?

40:31.390 --> 40:34.030
Welll, you can see for yourselves.

40:34.340 --> 40:35.610
The red and the blue curves

40:35.610 --> 40:37.830
are the sensors that were outside the tub.

40:37.830 --> 40:40.490
Clearly you see the red line and the blue line.

40:40.490 --> 40:42.270
The pressure spike is really severe.

40:42.270 --> 40:43.430
180 PSI.

40:43.430 --> 40:47.410
Am I correct that the green line pretty minimal?

40:47.410 --> 40:50.150
The maximum pressure inside the tub was eight PSI.

40:50.150 --> 40:51.930
You're telling me that's survivable.

40:51.930 --> 40:53.380
Very survivable.

40:54.830 --> 40:56.330
No way,

40:57.190 --> 40:58.710
that is crazy.

40:58.870 --> 41:00.790
The difference between the sensors

41:00.790 --> 41:03.600
inside the tub and the ones on the outside 

41:03.600 --> 41:06.640
clearly show that the blast is survivable.

41:06.640 --> 41:08.350
And moreover -- 

41:08.500 --> 41:10.390
Would they have had hearing damage?

41:10.390 --> 41:11.300
The threshold for a ruptured eardrum

41:11.360 --> 41:13.440
starts around five PSI.

41:13.440 --> 41:15.610
There is a chance and according to research,

41:15.610 --> 41:19.270
there could be a 10% and 15% chance of hearing damage.

41:19.270 --> 41:20.940
That's still pretty long.

41:22.050 --> 41:23.820
That blows my freaking mind.

41:23.820 --> 41:27.310
With only a 10% to 15% chance of hearing damage,

41:27.310 --> 41:29.270
it seems that amazingly

41:29.270 --> 41:32.290
this "Lethal Weapon" leap is confirmed.

41:33.540 --> 41:36.790
I'm standing on the only intact part of our bathroom set,

41:36.790 --> 41:39.430
the cast iron tub or as I plan to refer to it,

41:39.430 --> 41:43.670
here I'm in, the bomb-proof survival vessel.

41:43.670 --> 41:45.370
Buster here is a living

41:45.370 --> 41:47.980
being thanks to the strength of this bathtub.

41:47.980 --> 41:51.470
And even though I predicted that that might actually occur,

41:51.480 --> 41:54.030
it doesn't mean I'm completely blown away,

41:54.030 --> 41:56.050
looking at the damage around me

41:56.120 --> 41:58.170
and finding out that it was true.

41:58.230 --> 42:00.390
I am totally astonished.

42:00.390 --> 42:01.500
I mean, first of all,

42:01.500 --> 42:02.770
it turns out that liquid nitrogen

42:02.770 --> 42:04.610
will slow down the detonation of a bomb.

42:04.610 --> 42:06.720
And then it turns out that the path tub

42:06.730 --> 42:09.500
will totally protect you from the blast when it does go off.

42:09.500 --> 42:11.750
How often do we replicate an action sequence

42:11.840 --> 42:13.490
and everything turns out to be true?

42:13.580 --> 42:15.140
Everything is confirmed.

42:15.390 --> 42:17.170
Who knew?

42:20.220 --> 42:21.830
Want to know why we did what we did?

42:21.840 --> 42:23.600
and didn't do what we didn't do?

42:23.600 --> 42:25.100
