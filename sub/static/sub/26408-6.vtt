00:01.520 --> 00:03.556
Previously onSEAL Team...Graham Kowit,

00:03.610 --> 00:05.953
American DEA agent,
went missing a few weeks ago,

00:06.000 --> 00:08.082
and I'm guessing
you know where to.

00:08.130 --> 00:09.392
You must consider
the possibility

00:09.440 --> 00:11.260
that Agent Kowit might be dead.

00:11.310 --> 00:12.527
I can live being
afraid for you.

00:12.570 --> 00:14.049
I just need you to take
my fear seriously.

00:14.100 --> 00:15.044
CLAY:
I'm still gonna love Stella,

00:15.100 --> 00:16.749
and that's not gonna change.

00:16.790 --> 00:17.927
All well and good, Clay.

00:17.970 --> 00:20.052
Until you come home in a box.

00:20.100 --> 00:22.227
Clay! Man down!

00:22.280 --> 00:24.362
RAY: He took a round
directly to his chest plate.

00:24.410 --> 00:25.490
LINDA:
Mikey and Emma need a dad,

00:25.540 --> 00:26.586
not a team leader.

00:26.630 --> 00:27.801
I'm the one
who was supposed to die.

00:27.850 --> 00:29.579
We're wheels up
for Mumbai in 20.

00:29.630 --> 00:32.849
Need you on that
plane, as Bravo 1.

00:32.900 --> 00:34.288
Jason.

00:34.330 --> 00:36.378
Standing down.
His choice.

00:37.600 --> 00:39.943
JASON:
Adam was killed in action.

00:39.990 --> 00:41.685
Gave his life
to save his brothers.

00:45.650 --> 00:50.087
SONNY: Now, as a proctor of
the Adam Seaver Memorial Open,

00:50.130 --> 00:52.394
I'm just saying, Blackburn...Yeah.

00:52.440 --> 00:54.396
your blood-alcohol level is

00:54.440 --> 00:57.352
way below
tournament requirements.

00:57.400 --> 00:59.265
That's right!
Roger that!
Drink up!

00:59.320 --> 01:00.833
That's a nice shot, ace!

01:00.880 --> 01:02.962
Where's he...
where's he going?

01:09.630 --> 01:13.100
[laughing, whooping,
indistinct chatter]

01:13.160 --> 01:15.287
ERIC:
So this was
Adam's refuge, huh?

01:15.330 --> 01:17.639
CLAY:
Every chance he got.

01:18.990 --> 01:21.595
I wish I, uh,
had joined him more.

01:21.640 --> 01:23.631
Playing golf.
I just didn't...

01:23.690 --> 01:25.419
Yeah, I rain-checked him
a dozen times.

01:25.470 --> 01:27.119
That's the rub, huh?

01:27.170 --> 01:29.126
Always think there's
gonna be another chance.

01:29.170 --> 01:33.254
Blackburn...
that is a two-beer penalty

01:33.310 --> 01:35.301
for killing my buzz!It's crazy! Yah-haw!

01:35.350 --> 01:37.955
[intro to Motorhead's
"Ace of Spades" playing]

01:38.010 --> 01:40.308
Mind if we play through?

01:42.660 --> 01:44.799
If you like to gamble

01:44.840 --> 01:46.967
I tell you I'm your man

01:47.010 --> 01:50.969
You win some, lose some,
it's all the same to me

01:57.460 --> 01:58.711
The pleasure is to play

01:58.770 --> 02:00.840
Makes no difference
what you say

02:04.820 --> 02:06.981
I don't share your greed,
the only card I need

02:07.030 --> 02:09.772
Is the Ace of Spades You'd better run, Sonny!

02:09.820 --> 02:12.334
The Ace of Spades Whoo!

02:13.560 --> 02:15.903
Get up!

02:15.960 --> 02:17.860
You know I'm born to lose You'd better run.

02:17.920 --> 02:19.820
And gambling is for fools

02:19.870 --> 02:21.349
But that's the way
I like it, baby

02:21.400 --> 02:23.265
I don't wanna live forever.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.175
Oh! Oh!

02:33.150 --> 02:35.186
What do you say we
have another one, huh?

02:35.240 --> 02:37.140
Ah, you don't have
to ask me twice.

02:37.200 --> 02:38.883
One more.

02:41.770 --> 02:43.977
You know, if things
went crazy in here,

02:44.030 --> 02:46.806
then I would always
end up out there.

02:46.860 --> 02:49.021
Your happy place.

02:49.080 --> 02:50.945
Yeah.

02:50.990 --> 02:53.777
This is my happy place.

02:53.820 --> 02:55.776
How's it going
with the kids?

02:55.820 --> 02:57.993
I'm just trying to stay
flexible, you know?

02:58.040 --> 02:59.644
I just want to
pick my battles.

02:59.700 --> 03:01.645
Must be hard alone.

03:01.700 --> 03:04.919
Some days it, uh, kind of works.

03:08.840 --> 03:11.354
What about our next deployment?
Thought about that?

03:11.400 --> 03:13.482
What? About me not being here
for three months,

03:13.540 --> 03:15.053
the kids alone without Alana?

03:15.100 --> 03:16.965
Of course I've thought
about it, Ray.

03:17.020 --> 03:18.669
Any conclusions?

03:18.720 --> 03:20.233
I think conclusions
is that I don't want

03:20.280 --> 03:21.360
to think about it, okay?

03:22.940 --> 03:24.896
Well, love you, brother.

03:26.160 --> 03:28.287
You just got a lot
on your plate.

03:28.330 --> 03:29.934
What do you say
we go outside

03:29.990 --> 03:31.503
and talk the carburetor
Into working?

03:31.550 --> 03:32.949
You think you can do that?

03:33.990 --> 03:35.423
Let's get
the carburetor working.

03:39.430 --> 03:43.309
Took a ride
with a friend of mine...

03:43.350 --> 03:45.659
Well, it's last call.Mm-hmm.

03:45.700 --> 03:47.656
Shouldn't you be finding
a pair of boots

03:47.700 --> 03:49.520
to knock up against?Mm.

03:49.570 --> 03:51.003
Well...

03:51.050 --> 03:55.396
tonight's recon yielded
no actual targets there, Davis.

03:55.450 --> 03:56.963
I see plenty.

03:57.010 --> 03:59.831
Based on your high standard
of living, what do you need?

03:59.890 --> 04:02.051
Female, breathing, right?Ooh.

04:02.110 --> 04:03.407
Wow, look at that.

04:03.460 --> 04:06.418
That was a low blow
right there.

04:06.460 --> 04:08.451
I happen to have
standards, okay?

04:08.500 --> 04:10.149
And they're real ones.

04:10.200 --> 04:12.065
Such as?Well, uh,

04:12.120 --> 04:15.021
I like 'em to get my motor
running, that's for sure.

04:15.080 --> 04:17.810
That's obvious.
What else?

04:17.860 --> 04:20.294
Well, they got to be
able to keep up with me.

04:20.340 --> 04:22.126
Sonny, I could
keep up with you.

04:22.170 --> 04:23.341
That right there, Davis,

04:23.390 --> 04:26.086
that's what makes you
a rare woman. Right?

04:26.130 --> 04:28.303
What else?

04:29.740 --> 04:31.469
Heart.

04:31.530 --> 04:33.213
Gots to have heart.

04:33.270 --> 04:35.261
Mm-hmm.Pride.

04:35.310 --> 04:37.312
And loyalty.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.055
Woop, woop.

04:39.100 --> 04:40.829
You know, I like
a little...

04:40.880 --> 04:42.666
a little fight
in a woman, too.

04:42.710 --> 04:44.701
She...Are you looking for a woman,

04:44.760 --> 04:46.796
or are you looking
for a racehorse?

04:46.850 --> 04:49.193
You see...

04:49.240 --> 04:54.109
I'll have you know I was raised
by a mama and two sisters

04:54.160 --> 04:57.630
that kick the balls off a bull
in Sunday heels.

04:57.680 --> 05:00.069
Okay? And maybe,
I don't know,

05:00.120 --> 05:02.338
maybe that spoiled me
a little bit.

05:02.380 --> 05:06.032
It might have, because that is
a lot to ask for at last call.

05:06.080 --> 05:09.902
That just depends on what kind
of bar we're in, I suppose.

05:11.920 --> 05:14.821
All right, so let's say
that you find said woman, right?

05:14.870 --> 05:16.952
Mm-hmm.This is it, this is it.

05:17.010 --> 05:19.706
A rare and elusive specimen,
I assure you.

05:19.750 --> 05:21.570
Elusive.
I like that.
Yes.

05:21.620 --> 05:24.407
Who's to say
that you could even handle her?

05:25.580 --> 05:27.059
No one.

05:27.100 --> 05:29.239
You see, that's
the fun of it.

05:29.280 --> 05:31.748
Yeah.Or the trouble of it.

05:31.800 --> 05:33.062
Well...

05:33.110 --> 05:35.192
it ain't fun...

05:35.240 --> 05:37.845
if it ain't trouble.

05:43.120 --> 05:44.633
WAITRESS:
You two done?

05:44.690 --> 05:46.169
Yes.

05:48.170 --> 05:49.296
We're done.

05:49.340 --> 05:50.898
We're done.

05:50.950 --> 05:52.258
I got this.

05:52.300 --> 05:53.608
Actually, that's
way too much money.

05:53.650 --> 05:55.208
You get it.I'm not getting that.

06:06.100 --> 06:08.318
Ooh, please tell
me that's coffee.

06:09.360 --> 06:10.793
I, uh...

06:12.020 --> 06:14.011
I stopped by the frame store.

06:15.460 --> 06:18.327
We're gonna put it up at the bar
on the wall with the, um...

06:18.370 --> 06:19.849
The others?

06:19.900 --> 06:21.197
Yeah.

06:21.250 --> 06:22.763
Nice.

06:22.810 --> 06:24.198
Yeah.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.865
It's getting better.

06:36.910 --> 06:38.775
_ Doesn't look like _
It's getting better.Well, It was

06:38.830 --> 06:40.047
a 7.62 round-- I mean, it's...

06:40.090 --> 06:41.603
you know, it leaves
a little bit of a mark.

06:41.660 --> 06:44.561
It'll heal.When? It's been six weeks.

06:44.620 --> 06:46.133
Stella, it'll heal.

06:46.180 --> 06:48.353
Don't move.

06:48.400 --> 06:49.708
Please.

06:49.750 --> 06:51.479
_ I'm not
putting that stuff on.

06:51.540 --> 06:53.667
That stuff smells like
an old lady in a tube.

06:53.710 --> 06:55.439
It's terrible.This stuff makes that

06:55.500 --> 06:56.489
go away.

06:56.540 --> 06:57.973
Just let me do it.

06:58.020 --> 06:59.840
Mm.
Don't move,
please.

07:09.600 --> 07:11.113
Well, you know, it's...

07:11.160 --> 07:14.038
it's not ink, so it's
not gonna wipe off.Shut up.

07:19.130 --> 07:21.086
Is everything okay with you?

07:22.390 --> 07:25.211
Yeah. Fine.

07:26.220 --> 07:27.346
See?

07:27.400 --> 07:28.788
It's already
looking better.

07:28.830 --> 07:30.138
Mm.

07:30.180 --> 07:31.351
JASON: You have
to go shopping tonight?

07:31.400 --> 07:32.708
Yes, I do.

07:32.750 --> 07:34.001
Winter formal is next month.

07:34.060 --> 07:35.482
Okay, listen,
you have tons of dresses there

07:35.540 --> 07:37.189
in your closet.
You got a bunch of them.

07:37.230 --> 07:39.050
You've got more dresses
than I have socks.That's true.

07:39.110 --> 07:41.408
Seriously?
I live with cavemen!

07:41.460 --> 07:42.802
Aw, ooga-booga.

07:42.850 --> 07:44.010
And I have plans.

07:44.070 --> 07:45.412
It's Saturday.I don't care if it's Saturday.

07:45.460 --> 07:47.155
You know I cannot...I can't bail
on Franny and Lulu

07:47.200 --> 07:48.371
to watch Caveboy.Grandma is out of town.
She's not here Saturday.

07:48.420 --> 07:49.899
House to myself.
Party.I have to work.

07:49.940 --> 07:51.544
I'm not taking him to the mall!
That's social suicide!

07:51.600 --> 07:52.544
I'm not going!

07:52.600 --> 07:53.897
And stop!

07:56.430 --> 07:57.988
This is all new to us
right now.

07:58.040 --> 07:59.462
This new situation's
been presented to us.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.203
We're gonna work through this,
you understand me?

08:01.260 --> 08:02.818
Emma, you're gonna take Mikey
to the movies,

08:02.870 --> 08:04.030
so you're not seen
with him.

08:04.090 --> 08:05.739
I'll leave work early
to get him,

08:05.780 --> 08:07.600
so you have your night
with your friends.

08:07.660 --> 08:09.696
Okay. All right,
Mikey's with me.

08:09.750 --> 08:11.263
Give me a hug.

08:11.310 --> 08:12.481
All right?

08:13.970 --> 08:15.392
Come here.

08:17.100 --> 08:19.273
Hey. It's gonna be
all right, buddy.

08:19.320 --> 08:20.537
Okay, we got this.

08:20.580 --> 08:23.185
One shift at a time.
You understand

08:24.590 --> 08:26.535
We got more eyes
in here than usual.

08:26.590 --> 08:27.716
ERIC:
Good morning, everyone.

08:27.760 --> 08:29.842
Bravo Team is about to prosecute

08:29.900 --> 08:31.504
a highly sensitive
target package

08:31.550 --> 08:33.677
that's taken months
to put together.

08:33.730 --> 08:36.335
Final approval came
from the White House,

08:36.380 --> 08:39.941
so we need everyone
to be squared away on this one.

08:39.990 --> 08:41.810
There's no margin
for error.

08:41.860 --> 08:42.940
Understood?

08:45.560 --> 08:47.471
Andres Doza.

08:47.520 --> 08:51.217
He's the head of the most
lethal cartel in Mexico,

08:51.260 --> 08:54.047
and one of the most slippery
fugitives alive today.

08:54.090 --> 08:56.354
We've only confirmed
four sightings of him

08:56.400 --> 08:57.958
in the last decade.

08:58.010 --> 08:59.875
His top lieutenants
are equally elusive.

09:00.930 --> 09:03.569
Doza was born in 1978
in Huaquechula.

09:03.630 --> 09:05.279
His parents were farmers.

09:05.320 --> 09:07.276
He's exported more dope
to the States

09:07.320 --> 09:09.015
than anyone in history,

09:09.070 --> 09:11.277
amassing a fortune unimaginable.

09:11.330 --> 09:13.491
All right, look, we know who
this guy is. What's the mission?

09:13.550 --> 09:15.632
You're gonna hunt him down.

09:15.680 --> 09:18.148
All right."Hunt him down"?

09:18.200 --> 09:20.987
We're-we're c_|eared_to
operate down In MeXIco?

09:21.030 --> 09:23.294
HARRINGTON:
Yes. Partnering
with Mexican Marines.

09:23.340 --> 09:24.989
Might take a while
to locate him.

09:25.040 --> 09:26.598
Maybe weeks, months.

09:29.090 --> 09:30.341
SONNY:
Excellent.

09:30.390 --> 09:32.085
A little R and R south
of the border.

09:32.130 --> 09:33.301
That sounds good to me.

09:33.350 --> 09:35.170
MANDY:
It's not a booty run
to Cabo, Sonny.

09:35.220 --> 09:38.485
Doza's cartel has
thousands of soldiers,

09:38.530 --> 09:41.135
a $20 billion war chest,

09:41.180 --> 09:43.614
and the most sophisticated
weaponry money can buy.

09:43.670 --> 09:46.184
If E! Chapo was Saddam Hussein,
then Doza is ISIS.

09:46.230 --> 09:47.481
He's sadistic,

09:47.540 --> 09:50.145
vicious and indifferent
to innocent life.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.101
Well, that's great.
He's been that for a decade.

09:52.150 --> 09:53.799
Why are we engaging now?

09:53.850 --> 09:55.499
He crossed a line.

09:55.550 --> 09:58.326
He_ executed
an American DEA agent.

10:07.340 --> 10:09.900
From the people of Mxico,

10:09.950 --> 10:11.645
remember...

10:11.690 --> 10:14.818
only Andres Doza protects you

10:14.870 --> 10:17.475
from foreign invaders.

10:34.240 --> 10:36.014
Mm.

10:39.200 --> 10:41.361
The video goes on
for 30 minutes.

10:42.850 --> 10:44.021
Wheels up at 0700 tomorrow.

10:44.070 --> 10:45.890
I suggest you spend
the rest of the day

10:45.940 --> 10:47.680
getting your affairs in order.

10:47.730 --> 10:50.426
Captain Harrington
has the final word.

10:54.340 --> 10:56.388
Nobody does us like that.

10:56.430 --> 10:59.035
You go to Mexico,

10:59.090 --> 11:00.819
you find Doza,

11:00.870 --> 11:04.431
you don't come home
till he's in cuffs or a coffin.

11:04.480 --> 11:06.220
Is that understood?

11:08.100 --> 11:09.260
All right, we're done here.

11:25.290 --> 11:26.245
Master Chief.Yeah.

11:26.290 --> 11:27.803
A word before you shove off.

11:27.860 --> 11:30.021
Pep talk?More like
a watch-your-ass talk.

11:30.080 --> 11:32.241
Listen, I don't need a bunch
of SEALs making bad headlines

11:32.300 --> 11:33.597
in our own baclqard, right?

11:33.640 --> 11:34.902
Sir, you have concerns?

11:34.950 --> 11:36.906
Just want to make sure
everyone's focused.

11:36.950 --> 11:38.258
Oh, okay. Everyone.

11:38.300 --> 11:41.121
You mean me when
you say "everyone."

11:41.170 --> 11:43.604
Look, given everything
that Bravo's been through

11:43.650 --> 11:45.254
the last months,
some people may think that,

11:45.310 --> 11:47.528
you know, this should have gone
to Alpha or Charlie.

11:47.570 --> 11:49.435
Some? Everything that
Bravo's been through

11:49.490 --> 11:51.355
has only made us stronger.
So the only person

11:51.400 --> 11:53.448
that should be concerned
is Andres Doza.

11:53.490 --> 11:55.446
That's who should
be concerned, srr.

11:55.490 --> 11:57.958
Music to
my ears, Hayes.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.276
Look, I hate to spring
this trip on you,

12:02.330 --> 12:04.275
but you know
how it goes.

12:04.330 --> 12:06.286
And you don't know
when you're coming back?

12:06.330 --> 12:07.627
No, buddy.

12:07.680 --> 12:08.760
Don't worry, Dad.

12:08.810 --> 12:10.766
Grandma Linda
will be great.

12:10.810 --> 12:12.414
What about hockey tryouts?

12:12.470 --> 12:13.858
What about
hockey tryouts?

12:13.900 --> 12:14.946
You're ready, huh?

12:14.990 --> 12:16.548
You're prepared.

12:16.600 --> 12:17.726
Where's your
first shot go?

12:17.780 --> 12:19.031
Straight in the goalie's
face mask.

12:19.080 --> 12:20.126
Right. Why?

12:20.170 --> 12:21.774
'Cause you want to
get in his head.

12:21.820 --> 12:24.129
Get in his head. Right?

12:24.170 --> 12:25.774
Yeah.

12:25.830 --> 12:27.957
I'm gonna try and get back
for winter formals.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.468
I know. But it will be easier
to get a date

12:30.530 --> 12:32.521
without you around
to interrogate him.

12:32.570 --> 12:33.525
Really?Mm-hmm.

12:33.570 --> 12:34.787
I have drones.

12:34.840 --> 12:36.046
They will be overhead.

12:36.100 --> 12:37.965
Scary thing is
I sort of believe you.

12:38.010 --> 12:40.535
You should. If you need
anything, Aunt Naima,

12:40.580 --> 12:42.184
she's got my credit card.Mm-hmm.

12:42.230 --> 12:44.539
All right? Get
yourself a dress.

12:44.580 --> 12:46.457
Thanks, Dad.All right.
Listen, hey.

12:46.500 --> 12:48.752
Make sure there's a lot
of material to cover things.Mm-hmm.

12:48.810 --> 12:50.323
I will.

12:50.370 --> 12:51.450
Mm.

12:51.500 --> 12:54.378
Hey, look at me.
You're gonna be okay.

12:54.420 --> 12:56.502
Okay?Okay.

12:56.550 --> 12:59.201
Okay, you take care of him.Yeah. I will.

12:59.250 --> 13:00.854
All right?Like you said,

13:00.910 --> 13:03.777
we're figuring things
out, as a family.

13:03.820 --> 13:06.072
Oh, wait. Um, we
made you a calendar.

13:06.130 --> 13:08.769
Mm. I marked our schedules
so you know what we're doing

13:08.830 --> 13:10.172
and the good
times to Slqpe.

13:10.220 --> 13:12.302
You made a calendar
for me?Mm-hmm.

13:12.350 --> 13:14.306
Wow.

13:14.350 --> 13:17.524
Dad, just...
come home safe.

13:18.580 --> 13:20.389
That's what your mom
used to say.

13:20.450 --> 13:22.224
I know.

13:23.280 --> 13:24.884
All right, look, group hug.

13:24.930 --> 13:27.364
Come on. Group hug.

13:28.410 --> 13:30.014
I love you guys.

13:30.070 --> 13:32.322
Love you.Love you, too.

13:43.300 --> 13:44.983
You sure everything's fine?

13:46.040 --> 13:48.167
Please be careful.

13:48.210 --> 13:50.349
Look, I know I...

13:50.390 --> 13:52.608
I know what happened in Mumbai
is really bothering you.Mm.

13:52.650 --> 13:55.824
I get it.We don't need to talk
about that.

13:55.870 --> 13:58.009
What's going on?

14:01.660 --> 14:03.878
Everything is fine.

14:03.930 --> 14:05.795
Stella, why are you saying
everything is fine?

14:05.840 --> 14:09.094
Look, I-I can't...
I can't be dodging bullets

14:09.150 --> 14:11.402
if my mind is back here
worrying about you.

14:11.450 --> 14:13.054
If there's a problem,
I can fix it.

14:13.110 --> 14:14.407
I don't...Just-just...

14:14.460 --> 14:15.404
just get on the plane.

14:15.460 --> 14:16.848
Please. What?

14:16.890 --> 14:18.767
Stella, it's-it's me.

14:18.810 --> 14:21.062
Just go.
Please, just go.

14:21.120 --> 14:23.247
Dude, talk to me here.
Come on...

14:25.990 --> 14:28.242
Just that...

14:30.300 --> 14:33.258
You're everything.

14:33.300 --> 14:35.291
All right? You're everything.

14:35.350 --> 14:36.863
I-I...

14:36.910 --> 14:39.606
I love you more than I thought
that I could love someone,

14:39.660 --> 14:41.264
and...Then what

14:41.310 --> 14:42.914
I don't understand. Th-This.

14:42.960 --> 14:45.781
All of this.
This is the problem.

14:45.840 --> 14:48.798
Is that the more that
I love you, the harder it gets.

14:48.840 --> 14:50.740
Okay?

14:51.840 --> 14:54.536
When you leave,
I don't sleep at night.

14:55.850 --> 14:57.624
I have this constant pit

14:57.670 --> 14:58.932
in my stomach.

14:58.980 --> 15:00.891
And-and I'm afraid.

15:00.940 --> 15:02.020
I'm afraid of every phone call.

15:02.070 --> 15:03.674
I'm afraid of every knock
at the door.

15:03.720 --> 15:05.278
The knock is never gonna come.
I'm not...

15:05.330 --> 15:06.501
You got shot six weeks ago,
Clay.

15:06.550 --> 15:08.074
You can't promise me that.I'm not gonna...

15:08.120 --> 15:11.032
Look, any-anybody could die at
any time doing-doing anything.

15:11.080 --> 15:12.809
No. Don't bring up
Alana's death.

15:12.860 --> 15:15.465
Her death was tragic luck.

15:15.520 --> 15:18.125
But Adam...

15:18.170 --> 15:19.432
that...

15:21.960 --> 15:23.689
That was an eventuality.

15:26.010 --> 15:29.047
And I don't think I can...
I don't think I can live my life

15:29.100 --> 15:31.660
waiting for that
to happen to you.

15:31.710 --> 15:33.359
What are you saying?

15:36.060 --> 15:40.668
I think that you deserve someone

15:40.720 --> 15:44.099
that will embrace your life,

15:44.160 --> 15:47.152
not resent it.

15:48.160 --> 15:51.721
Someone that's better than me.

15:53.560 --> 15:55.505
I love you.

15:56.860 --> 15:59.124
I do. I love you so much,
but I don't...

15:59.170 --> 16:02.162
I don't think
that I can be with you anymore.

16:02.220 --> 16:04.381
Hey! We're wheels up, Romeo.

16:04.440 --> 16:05.691
Let's go.

16:05.740 --> 16:07.389
Come on.

16:11.050 --> 16:12.574
I'm so... I'm sorry.

16:12.620 --> 16:14.611
I'm sorry.

17:01.100 --> 17:03.056
[indistinct shouting
in distance]

17:04.760 --> 17:06.978
Everybody, this is Rita Alfaro,

17:07.020 --> 17:08.624
my counterpart
in Mexican intelligence

17:08.670 --> 17:10.547
and the liaison
for our operation here.

17:10.590 --> 17:11.579
Bienvenidos.

17:11.630 --> 17:13.325
On behalf of
Mexican CISEN, welcome.

17:13.380 --> 17:14.802
We look forward
to working with you

17:14.850 --> 17:16.329
in the spirit of cooperation.

17:16.380 --> 17:17.631
Yeah, well, I'm more interested

17:17.680 --> 17:19.898
in the spirit
of air-conditioning.

17:19.950 --> 17:21.554
Why so many?

17:23.170 --> 17:26.128
We don't want anything to happen
to you on the way in.

17:26.170 --> 17:29.298
You'll want your
weapons hot.

17:29.350 --> 17:31.341
Let's load up.

17:33.050 --> 17:35.473
Broad daylight. Largest
metropolitan city in the world.

17:35.530 --> 17:37.566
And they are seriously
worried about a hit?

17:38.970 --> 17:41.131
I already got a bad
feeling, brother.

17:41.190 --> 17:43.181
Join the club.

18:04.030 --> 18:05.986
So this is what you do, huh?

18:06.040 --> 18:07.029
RITA:
Do?

18:07.080 --> 18:08.513
Cartel hunter.

18:08.560 --> 18:10.118
Sure.

18:10.170 --> 18:11.558
Any wisdom to share?

18:11.610 --> 18:14.249
They're everywhere, and
you'll never know who to trust.

18:14.310 --> 18:15.641
Well, since you brought it up,

18:15.700 --> 18:18.214
Doza owns plenty
of people down here,

18:18.270 --> 18:19.658
Mexican Marines included.

18:19.700 --> 18:22.612
No offense, Lopez.

18:22.660 --> 18:24.264
The state police,
they're all bad.

18:24.320 --> 18:26.129
Yeah, the Federales
are questionable.

18:26.190 --> 18:28.272
But every Marine
on this operation

18:28.320 --> 18:30.447
was handpicked
by Colonel Martinez.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.183
I trust him, so I trust them.

18:32.240 --> 18:34.140
Why should we trust you?

18:34.200 --> 18:35.883
You shouldn't.

18:35.940 --> 18:38.579
Well, I can officially say that
nothing about this conversation

18:38.630 --> 18:40.109
has made me feel any better.

18:52.520 --> 18:54.647
Lot of hero worship with Doza.

18:54.690 --> 18:57.124
He builds schools, hospitals,

18:57.170 --> 18:59.343
provides services
the government can't.

18:59.390 --> 19:01.915
He buys hearts
and minds.

19:01.960 --> 19:03.211
Who's that guy?

19:07.230 --> 19:09.744
The posters mean Doza's cartel
has marked him for death.

19:09.800 --> 19:12.360
What did he do?A couple of Doza's men

19:12.410 --> 19:13.570
kidnapped
and raped his daughter.

19:13.630 --> 19:15.188
He reported it to the police.

19:15.240 --> 19:17.754
Biblical-level wickedness.

19:17.800 --> 19:19.586
In America,
power is accrued through money.

19:19.630 --> 19:22.417
In Mxico, power
is accrued through violence.

19:22.460 --> 19:24.064
Did you know there have been
more deaths here

19:24.110 --> 19:25.190
in the last decade

19:25.250 --> 19:28.765
than in Iraq and
Afghanistan combined?

19:29.860 --> 19:32.078
That's madness.

19:59.020 --> 20:01.329
RITA: Welcome. Doza
has his eyes and ears

20:01.370 --> 20:04.806
on every military base and
police station in the country,

20:04.850 --> 20:07.318
so we've made this old
factory our unIt's home.

20:13.340 --> 20:15.808
Lieutenant Commander
Eric Blackburn.

20:15.860 --> 20:17.464
Colonel Francisco Martinez.

20:17.520 --> 20:18.771
Welcome.Thank you.

20:18.820 --> 20:20.128
Though in the interest
of transparency,

20:20.170 --> 20:21.990
I was not in favor
of your presence here.

20:22.040 --> 20:23.644
It's my job to ﬁnd Doza.

20:23.700 --> 20:24.906
How's that working out?

20:26.920 --> 20:29.081
We're only here to help,
Colonel.

20:29.140 --> 20:30.300
Any way we can.

20:30.350 --> 20:31.396
Excellent.

20:31.440 --> 20:33.488
You can help
by following the rules.

20:33.530 --> 20:36.795
No_alcohol or women
In the barracks.

20:36.840 --> 20:39.445
Lieutenant Lopez will show
your men to their quarters.

20:39.490 --> 20:41.276
We will all meet
once they're settled.

20:41.320 --> 20:42.491
This way.

20:42.540 --> 20:43.791
Thank you.

20:43.850 --> 20:45.147
Master Chief Hayes,

20:45.200 --> 20:47.327
you are Bravo Team's
direct leader, yes?

20:47.370 --> 20:48.803
That's right.Good.

20:48.850 --> 20:50.715
Here, I am yours.

20:53.290 --> 20:55.508
You understand that, correct?

20:55.550 --> 20:57.939
Understood.

21:01.300 --> 21:03.860
This place makes
our hooches in J-Bad

21:03.910 --> 21:05.161
look like Graceland.

21:05.220 --> 21:08.121
I've slept
in nicer prison cells.

21:08.170 --> 21:10.252
No booze.
Was he serIous?

21:10.310 --> 21:11.732
SONNY:
I hope so.

21:11.790 --> 21:15.089
Without rules, there's
only windows and noses to break.

21:15.140 --> 21:18.177
I'm assuming you brought
the emergency cache?

21:18.230 --> 21:19.572
You know it.Ooh.

21:19.620 --> 21:21.133
TRENT: Should last
a night or two.

21:21.190 --> 21:22.669
SONNY: Oh, yeah.
That stuff's fire, man.

21:22.710 --> 21:24.701
Yeah.

21:33.680 --> 21:34.806
Aw.

21:34.850 --> 21:37.808
Loolq here, Ray.

21:37.860 --> 21:39.725
You ever seen a cuter couple?

21:39.770 --> 21:42.159
Oh, like the couple in the
picture frame when you buy it.

21:44.690 --> 21:46.942
RAY: Saying good-bye
never gets any easier, brother.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.809
You just remember
what you got waiting for you

21:48.870 --> 21:50.474
when you get back home.

21:52.920 --> 21:55.343
So, a country
of 125 million people,

21:55.400 --> 21:57.300
and no one knows where Doza is?

21:57.350 --> 21:59.568
Nine months ago, he visited
a girlfriend in Jalisco.

21:59.620 --> 22:01.394
But Doza was tipped off
to our presence.

22:01.450 --> 22:04.135
He slipped away
before we arrived.

22:04.190 --> 22:05.919
The man responsible
for Doza's security

22:05.970 --> 22:07.096
was found skinned alive.

22:07.150 --> 22:09.368
Whenever we find_
a weakness to exp|0It,

22:09.410 --> 22:10.968
Doza eliminates it.

22:11.020 --> 22:13.625
Okay. Well, is there anything
we can actually go on here?

22:13.680 --> 22:16.365
Graham Kowit's execution video.

22:16.420 --> 22:18.069
This is Carlos Gonzalez.

22:18.110 --> 22:20.499
He's Doza's version
of "Jihadi John."

22:20.550 --> 22:23.018
He acts as an executioner
and a propagandIst.

22:23.080 --> 22:24.638
I thought we were
here to catch Doza,

22:24.690 --> 22:26.294
not chase around his
little street rats.

22:26.340 --> 22:28.854
No way he kills a DEA agent
without approval from the top.

22:28.910 --> 22:30.639
If we grab Gonzalez,
he could connect us

22:30.690 --> 22:32.169
to Doza's inner circle.

22:32.220 --> 22:34.438
So where is he?LOPEZ:
Telporo.

22:34.480 --> 22:36.129
It's a cartel-controlled slum.

22:36.180 --> 22:38.216
It's where I_was born
and raIsed.

22:38.260 --> 22:40.649
Doza's soldadosare interspersed
among the locals there,

22:40.700 --> 22:43.612
so it's impossible to tell
who's bad, who's good.

22:43.660 --> 22:46.447
We set at the edges of the
neighborhood, blend in.

22:46.490 --> 22:48.185
And we wait for
Gonzalez to come out.

22:48.230 --> 22:51.313
Until somebody leaks that we're
onto him and then he disappears.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.793
I lost five men
in a raid there last year.

22:53.850 --> 22:55.408
Lopez is right.

22:55.460 --> 22:57.678
We take Gonzalez on our terms,
outside of that powder keg.

22:57.720 --> 22:59.585
Oh, so you want us
to sit and wait.

22:59.630 --> 23:02.064
There's no chance. We're
gonna take It to hIm.

23:02.110 --> 23:03.247
We hope they're gonna
want to fight.

23:03.290 --> 23:04.279
And you know what
we're gonna do?

23:04.330 --> 23:05.729
We're gonna punish 'em.

23:05.770 --> 23:07.419
'Cause we're gonna send
a message.

23:07.470 --> 23:09.984
Five minutes here, and you have
all the answers, huh?

23:10.040 --> 23:11.689
You want to play cat and mouse,
go ahead, play cat and mouse,

23:11.730 --> 23:13.254
but you see, we're
an assault team.

23:13.300 --> 23:14.608
That's what we do.

23:14.650 --> 23:16.254
We assault, so that's
what we're gonna do.

23:16.300 --> 23:18.165
We're gonna go in,
and we're gonna grab Gonzalez.

23:26.490 --> 23:29.789
Small village, locals on
the payroll of a killer.

23:29.840 --> 23:31.569
It sounds like Afghanistan
to me, right?

23:31.620 --> 23:33.406
So let's rip
from our own playbook.

23:33.450 --> 23:35.532
Offset infil.
Yep.

23:35.580 --> 23:36.922
Patrol to the
target on foot.

23:36.980 --> 23:38.971
Combat clear.Combat clear.

23:39.020 --> 23:40.931
It's like you two
were never apart.No.

23:40.980 --> 23:43.847
Neighborhood is gonna recognize
us being outsiders.

23:43.900 --> 23:45.106
We need to go indig.

23:45.160 --> 23:47.890
Cmo se dice"Scooby van"?

23:47.940 --> 23:49.202
JASON:
No. We can't do vans.

23:49.250 --> 23:50.729
Gonna need something heavier
than 4165

23:50.770 --> 23:52.988
in case something goes sideways,
you know what I'm saying?

23:53.040 --> 23:54.814
You bet your ass we will.

23:54.860 --> 23:56.725
IT2, set up the ISR link ASAP.

23:56.780 --> 23:59.248
Roger that, sir.
Right.

23:59.300 --> 24:01.348
We believe that this
is Gonzalez's home.

24:01.390 --> 24:02.698
It's two stories.

24:02.740 --> 24:04.469
If Martinez and Lopez
give us enough shooters

24:04.530 --> 24:05.690
to split in three groups,

24:05.740 --> 24:07.560
we'll clear the floors
SImultaneously.

24:07.620 --> 24:10.783
Actually, Lieutenant Lopez
is not going on this raid.

24:13.320 --> 24:14.389
I'm sorry, what's that?

24:15.450 --> 24:17.008
I'm from Telporo.

24:17.060 --> 24:19.620
I'm known there.It's too dangerous for him.

24:19.670 --> 24:21.752
Danger's kind of, uh, part
of the whole soldier thing.

24:21.800 --> 24:23.848
Lopez is not going.JASON: Well, then,
I don't want him

24:23.890 --> 24:26.358
in this meeting hearing
the details of our raid.

24:26.420 --> 24:27.409
You don't trust me?

24:27.460 --> 24:29.246
No. I don't trust you.

24:29.290 --> 24:31.110
Hard to trust a soldier
who doesn't fight.

24:37.300 --> 24:38.289
Lopez.

24:42.130 --> 24:44.951
Lopez is a good soldier,
but he is a little volatile.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.821
Please, continue.

24:47.870 --> 24:49.178
Okay. Rules of engagement.

24:49.220 --> 24:50.949
Don't fire unless fired upon.

24:51.010 --> 24:53.968
The entire community of
Telporo is on Doza's payroll.

24:54.010 --> 24:55.830
So once we enter,

24:55.880 --> 24:59.407
anywhere along the way,
whoever we see could kill us.

24:59.450 --> 25:02.089
In fact, many of them
would love to kill one of you.

25:02.150 --> 25:05.529
It would be like a trophy
for them, a prize.

25:05.590 --> 25:07.490
If we are compromised
in any way,

25:07.540 --> 25:09.588
_ Doza's soldados
WIll unleash hell on us,

25:09.630 --> 25:11.769
so I suggest placing
our set point

25:11.810 --> 25:13.539
outside of their territory.

25:13.590 --> 25:15.808
Okay, we'll do that.
Let's roll.

25:25.950 --> 25:27.030
American hero.

25:27.090 --> 25:30.173
Thinks he knows
how to fight our war.

25:30.220 --> 25:33.132
You should show Colonel Martinez
a little bit more respect.

25:33.180 --> 25:34.829
You should respect him enough
to fight next to him.

25:34.880 --> 25:36.689
Don't question my loyalty.

25:36.750 --> 25:38.741
I question a lot more
than that.

25:38.790 --> 25:40.929
Telporo's my home.

25:40.970 --> 25:42.665
And I grew up
with those thugs.

25:42.710 --> 25:44.530
Anybody knows that I'm
in the Doza unit,

25:44.580 --> 25:46.571
they kill everyone
I ever knew.

25:46.630 --> 25:49.360
Nobody's gonna know, 'cause
you're not gonna be there.

25:57.250 --> 25:58.547
Ray.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.465
Hold up.

26:00.510 --> 26:02.330
Uh-oh. This can't be good.

26:02.380 --> 26:05.725
Thanks. Can't_a
gIrl just say hI?

26:06.730 --> 26:09.198
Absolutely, but not this one.

26:09.260 --> 26:11.160
Mm.
Let me guess.

26:11.220 --> 26:13.256
You want to talk
about my friend?

26:14.440 --> 26:16.783
It took months to convince SOCOM

26:16.830 --> 26:19.481
to greenlight this op, and with
everything that's happened...

26:19.530 --> 26:22.090
You're concerned
about Jason's headspace.

26:22.140 --> 26:24.096
You mean you don't
have concerns?

26:24.140 --> 26:25.220
Come on, Mandy.

26:25.270 --> 26:28.057
The guy's got a lot
to deal with.

26:28.100 --> 26:30.489
That's precisely
why I'm concerned.

26:30.540 --> 26:33.498
We won't catch Doza
if Jason's head is elsewhere.

26:33.540 --> 26:36.100
Tough to doubt a man
that comes out on the right side

26:36.150 --> 26:38.766
as often as Jason does.

26:38.810 --> 26:40.892
But...

26:40.940 --> 26:42.896
I'll keep an eye on him.

26:42.940 --> 26:45.374
Be enough?

26:53.300 --> 26:55.473
I feel like
these Mexican uniforms

26:55.520 --> 26:59.559
are like the skinny jeans
of military apparel.

26:59.610 --> 27:01.828
Yeah, well, I'm pretty sure
our hosts don't want us

27:01.880 --> 27:03.745
flashing Old Glory
across the city, right?

27:03.790 --> 27:06.873
It's just they're just
so formfitting, you know?

27:06.920 --> 27:08.615
I-I swear on the Bible,

27:08.670 --> 27:11.628
my testosterone count
is dropping as we speak.

27:11.670 --> 27:13.706
Well, look on the bright side,
Sonny, right?

27:13.760 --> 27:15.921
At least that uni helps
highlight your enormous ass.

27:15.980 --> 27:18.847
Well, I sense some jealousy
there of my gluteus maximus.

27:18.890 --> 27:20.585
See, look at this:
the bend and snap.

27:21.980 --> 27:23.288
Hey, wait, wait.
Why's Sonny ass

27:23.330 --> 27:25.116
look so big in
those pants, huh?

27:25.160 --> 27:27.116
You hear that?All this talk
about my backside

27:27.160 --> 27:28.764
is seriously making me
reconsider

27:28.820 --> 27:30.469
my commitment
to Bravo right now.

27:30.510 --> 27:33.206
Gentlemen, my men here
will drive us to the target.

27:33.260 --> 27:34.864
Eyes open, weapons ready.All right, let's load up.

27:34.910 --> 27:37.777
Oh. It looks like we're not the
only ones working tonight, huh?

27:49.230 --> 27:50.652
It's good to see
you reconsidered.

28:09.470 --> 28:12.246
Doza teach Sunday school there?

28:12.290 --> 28:13.814
The priest would remove
that poster,

28:13.860 --> 28:15.851
but he would be killed
immediately.

28:23.780 --> 28:27.136
Thought this was a
no-go zone for police.

28:27.180 --> 28:29.523
For Federalesand military.

28:29.570 --> 28:33.449
They're local,
on Doza's payroll.

28:36.580 --> 28:38.275
Havoc Base, this is Bravo 2.

28:38.320 --> 28:39.969
We pass Black Lab. How copy?

28:40.020 --> 28:41.669
Yeah, roger that,
Bravo 2.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.142
We copy Black Lab.

29:01.650 --> 29:04.824
We here to rob a bank or
put the hurt on Gonzalez?

29:04.870 --> 29:07.691
Anybody working against Doza
is killed by Doza.

29:07.740 --> 29:11.346
What do you say in Spanish
before you go on a mission?

29:11.400 --> 29:13.652
Que la Fuerza te acompae.

29:13.700 --> 29:17.090
Okay. Que la Fuerza
te acompae.Let's do this.

29:18.400 --> 29:19.879
DAVIS:
Bravo 2, this is Havoc Base.

29:19.930 --> 29:22.228
You're headed to
the two-story pink building

29:22.280 --> 29:24.578
half a klick to your east.

29:24.630 --> 29:26.052
Roger that, Havoc.
Bravo out.

29:26.110 --> 29:28.101
Let's hustle, boys.
Let's go.

29:42.120 --> 29:43.724
JASON:
Bravo 6, pick up your pace.

29:45.820 --> 29:49.290
Bravo 1, this is Havoc.
Be advised, we are observing

29:49.350 --> 29:51.955
five military-age males
forming up one klick

29:52.000 --> 29:53.171
north of your pos.

29:55.310 --> 29:57.130
JASON: Copy, Havoc.

29:57.180 --> 29:58.909
Passing Golden Retriever.

29:58.970 --> 30:01.484
Copy Golden Retriever.

30:18.640 --> 30:20.631
JASON:
Blow it.

31:21.050 --> 31:22.870
My eyes!

31:47.120 --> 31:49.543
Reinforced steel.

31:49.600 --> 31:50.942
Triple-locked.

31:50.990 --> 31:52.469
What do you think
they're hiding in there?

31:55.430 --> 31:57.682
You hear that?

31:58.910 --> 31:59.865
No Gonzalez.

31:59.910 --> 32:02.128
The lookouts might
have warned him.

32:02.180 --> 32:04.045
All stations, this is 1.

32:04.090 --> 32:06.399
First deck is clear.

32:06.440 --> 32:08.351
Bravo 3,
what do you got up top?

32:08.400 --> 32:10.914
I need two mikes
to figure out what's behind

32:10.970 --> 32:11.925
door number two, boss.

32:11.970 --> 32:13.130
I hope for a new car.

32:13.190 --> 32:14.407
Bravo 6, what's
your status?

32:14.450 --> 32:15.485
CLAY:
Bravo 1.

32:15.540 --> 32:16.757
Could use a couple
extra shooters.

32:16.800 --> 32:18.188
Prepping for a breach
on a door.

32:18.240 --> 32:20.014
Copy that.
Coming your way.

32:21.060 --> 32:22.368
I'm moving now.

32:51.570 --> 32:53.174
All stations, this is Bravo 3.

32:53.230 --> 32:55.391
I just saw the HVT squirt out

32:55.450 --> 32:57.964
of the east side
of the target building.

32:58.010 --> 33:00.183
Bravo 3, we see
one unknown exiting

33:00.230 --> 33:01.310
the east side
of the target building,

33:01.370 --> 33:02.621
moving north of your position.

33:02.670 --> 33:03.978
I think that's Gonzalez.

33:04.020 --> 33:05.100
SONNY:
Good copy, Havoc.

33:05.150 --> 33:08.017
Break. Bravo 1, this is Bravo 3.

33:08.070 --> 33:11.198
I suggest we run down Gonzalez.

33:11.250 --> 33:13.855
Havoc can coordinate
mobIIIty platforms VIa ISR,

33:13.900 --> 33:15.629
and we cut him off.Negative, Bravo 3.

33:15.680 --> 33:17.728
Not without us. Stand by.

33:17.770 --> 33:19.635
Burning!

33:22.730 --> 33:23.992
Come on.

33:27.870 --> 33:29.519
RAY:
Holy mother of God.

33:39.010 --> 33:41.058
RAY:
Holy mother of God.

33:41.100 --> 33:43.056
ERIC:
Bravo 1, this is Havoc.

33:43.100 --> 33:46.012
We still have eyes on the HVT
via ISR.

33:46.060 --> 33:48.199
SONNY:
Bravo 1, this is Bravo 3.

33:48.240 --> 33:49.013
If we don't move now,

33:49.070 --> 33:50.628
Gonzalez is gone.

33:50.680 --> 33:52.363
Why isn't Jason pursuing?

33:52.420 --> 33:54.980
There's enough time to catch
Gonzalez if we move now.

33:55.030 --> 33:56.930
SONNY:
Bravo 1, this is Bravo 3.

33:56.990 --> 33:59.072
We can still get Gonzalez
if we move.

33:59.120 --> 34:01.338
Am I cleared hot
to go after him?

34:02.690 --> 34:04.590
JASON:
3, hold what you got.

34:04.650 --> 34:06.732
_ SONNY:
Say agaIn your last, Bravo 1.

34:07.780 --> 34:09.168
Damn it.

34:09.220 --> 34:10.426
Negative, Bravo 3.

34:10.480 --> 34:11.993
Set security and
hold what you've got.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.381
We've got civilians down
here who are in bad shape.

34:13.440 --> 34:15.044
We got to get them out.

34:16.310 --> 34:19.097
I copy. Holding my position.

34:19.140 --> 34:22.359
RITA: The buildings at the top
of the hill are connected.

34:22.400 --> 34:24.265
Gonzalez will disappear
in that maze,

34:24.320 --> 34:26.538
and we'll have nothing
to put us on Doza's trail.

34:26.580 --> 34:29.572
I'm sure he has his
reasons for standing down.Yeah.

34:29.630 --> 34:31.586
They're back in Virginia Beach.

34:33.630 --> 34:35.678
What about Gonzalez?Another place, another time.

34:35.720 --> 34:37.233
Not enough guns to
divide my force.

34:37.290 --> 34:38.678
I didn't say anything.

34:38.720 --> 34:41.154
All stations, stand
by to exfil and SSE.

34:41.200 --> 34:43.418
Collect all phones,
anything you can find.

34:45.120 --> 34:46.985
So the mission's over?

34:47.040 --> 34:48.644
DAVIS:
Yeah, but not the battle.

34:51.300 --> 34:53.120
ERIC:
Bravo 1, this is Havoc.

34:53.170 --> 34:55.035
Be advised that we have

34:55.090 --> 34:59.345
what appears to be 20 armed
combatants headed to your pos.

34:59.400 --> 35:01.174
Recommend you exfil immediately.

35:01.220 --> 35:03.006
Copy that, Havoc. We're RTB.

35:03.050 --> 35:06.929
3, we're linking up
with you in five mikes.

35:20.770 --> 35:22.158
VVhoa!

35:28.080 --> 35:30.856
Havoc, this is 1.
We need immediate extract.

35:32.820 --> 35:34.640
ERIC:
Bravo 1, I copy request

35:34.690 --> 35:37.158
for extract at target building.
Stand by.

35:37.220 --> 35:39.859
Our trucks are never gonna
get in there. It's too hot.

35:41.260 --> 35:43.216
Well, Bravo 1,

35:43.270 --> 35:45.261
target building looks too hot
for an extract.

35:45.310 --> 35:47.778
Advise that you move
to rally point one on foot.

35:47.840 --> 35:48.966
Trucks will meet you there.

35:49.010 --> 35:50.568
Copy that, Havoc.

35:50.620 --> 35:52.144
All stations, change of plans.

35:52.190 --> 35:55.148
The exfil trucks can't make it
to us. We got to hoof it.

35:55.190 --> 35:57.101
We're not dodging
all these bullets

35:57.150 --> 35:58.754
with all these prisoners, boss.

35:58.800 --> 36:00.848
Lopez, you're from here, right?
Can you get us to those trucks

36:00.890 --> 36:02.152
without getting our asses
shot off?

36:02.200 --> 36:03.622
Go out the back entrance.

36:03.680 --> 36:04.715
Do it.

36:04.770 --> 36:06.021
Smoke.

36:11.430 --> 36:13.204
Move, move, move!

36:43.500 --> 36:44.671
Move, move!

36:44.720 --> 36:46.620
G0, 90, 90: 90: 90-

36:46.680 --> 36:47.669
Go.

36:47.720 --> 36:49.711
Move.

36:57.860 --> 37:00.294
Know what? Whatever it is
you want to say,

37:00.340 --> 37:01.557
just wait till morning.

37:01.610 --> 37:03.259
Your op just lit up
every government line

37:03.300 --> 37:04.858
from JSOC to the Pentagon.Is that right?

37:04.910 --> 37:06.468
Hopefully praising us
for saving six civilians

37:06.520 --> 37:07.657
from being tortured to death.

37:07.700 --> 37:09.088
Well, the target was Gonzalez.

37:09.130 --> 37:10.654
Dividing my force
was not an option.

37:10.700 --> 37:12.304
Are you questioning me
right now, Mandy?

37:12.360 --> 37:13.964
You know what, Jason?

37:14.010 --> 37:16.137
Given everything
that's gone on in your life,

37:16.190 --> 37:19.273
I absolutely understand
your hesitancy

37:19.320 --> 37:21.185
to drive deeper into danger.Hesitancy?

37:21.230 --> 37:22.959
The only thing that went
into my thought process

37:23.020 --> 37:24.180
was the safety of my men.

37:24.240 --> 37:26.322
Alpha and Charlie leaders

37:26.370 --> 37:28.713
would've made the same call.

37:29.720 --> 37:32.416
We don't stand a
chance of getting Doza

37:32.460 --> 37:34.724
if your head is back home.

37:34.770 --> 37:38.024
I didn't come here to lose.

37:38.080 --> 37:40.036
Neither did I.

37:40.080 --> 37:41.206
Ray?

37:41.250 --> 37:42.592
Give me the phones.

37:42.650 --> 37:45.039
Here you go. That's from Doza.

37:45.080 --> 37:46.866
Turn defeat into victory.

37:53.570 --> 37:55.697
You know what?
May have come up short,

37:55.750 --> 37:57.877
but, you know, it was good
having the team back.

37:57.920 --> 37:59.228
Got that right.Yeah.

37:59.270 --> 38:00.874
We're gonna get Gonzalez.

38:00.930 --> 38:03.091
CLAY: That's not
gonna happen.

38:03.150 --> 38:04.708
Why's that?

38:04.760 --> 38:06.705
Gonzalez knows he's targeted.

38:06.760 --> 38:09.274
Guy's gonna stay underground
as long as he has to.

38:09.330 --> 38:12.106
Missed our chance.RAY: Oh, fun police.

38:15.330 --> 38:18.766
Gentlemen, if you insist
on breaking my rules,

38:18.810 --> 38:20.721
at least donft insult
our natIon

38:20.770 --> 38:23.421
by drinking
that donkey water, okay?

38:23.470 --> 38:25.426
All right. There he goes.

38:27.780 --> 38:28.940
You earned a drink.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.729
Thank you, Colonel.

38:32.780 --> 38:34.566
Que la Fuerza te acompae,huh?

38:34.610 --> 38:36.566
Isn't that right, Lopez?

38:36.610 --> 38:39.078
You know that means "May
the Force be with you," right?

38:43.140 --> 38:44.573
So you're a funny guy,
is that it?

38:44.620 --> 38:45.962
Okay, I see you.

38:46.010 --> 38:47.659
It's a two-way street, man.

38:47.710 --> 38:49.758
Two ways.

38:49.800 --> 38:52.974
Colonel, you and your men
are great soldiers.Likewise.

38:53.020 --> 38:55.329
Now, let's just
make a deal, okay?

38:55.370 --> 38:57.065
You lead your men,
and I lead mine.

38:57.110 --> 38:59.192
Just needed to know what
kind of partner force

38:59.240 --> 39:00.411
we were dealing with there.

39:00.460 --> 39:02.633
Mm-hmm.Including your boy Lopez there.

39:02.680 --> 39:05.899
Just upset that we didn't
accomplish the op, that's all.

39:05.950 --> 39:08.646
Well, let's not forget...

39:08.690 --> 39:11.250
you brought back farmers
from the dead today, okay?

39:11.300 --> 39:13.518
And because of you,
there are six families

39:13.560 --> 39:15.994
who are celebrating,
not mourning.

39:16.040 --> 39:18.349
That's a victory in my book.

39:18.390 --> 39:21.302
Yeah. You know,
when you put it that way,

39:21.350 --> 39:23.136
it sounds much better.Good.

39:23.180 --> 39:25.228
Family is everything. Salud.

39:27.270 --> 39:30.706
Which reminds me, I got
an appointment to keep.

39:35.720 --> 39:38.712
Yep.

39:40.420 --> 39:42.229
You're awful quiet
over here, Spenser.

39:42.290 --> 39:45.191
Except when you're
challenging Jason.Mm.

39:45.250 --> 39:49.425
I saw your face
when he stood us down.

39:49.470 --> 39:52.428
You were just as confused
by the call as I was.

39:52.470 --> 39:55.598
Uh... look, man,

39:55.650 --> 39:57.993
I am still sitting here
under God's stars

39:58.040 --> 40:01.999
_ because Jason makes the
rIght call more often than not.

40:02.050 --> 40:05.952
No need to start us
questIonIng hIm now.

40:08.010 --> 40:11.480
Look, I know
this is a triclq one.

40:11.530 --> 40:14.055
Right? Whole team back together
kind of puts you

40:14.100 --> 40:15.533
into the "new guy" mode again

40:15.580 --> 40:17.309
when you've more
than proven yourself.

40:20.060 --> 40:22.062
That what eating at you?

40:23.110 --> 40:24.975
That's it.

40:33.030 --> 40:34.634
Thanks. Oh.

40:41.390 --> 40:43.085
Howdy.Howdy.

40:43.130 --> 40:46.475
You know, this is my first drink
since the other night.

40:46.530 --> 40:49.044
I'm still recovering.Yep.

40:49.090 --> 40:52.617
We drank enough Maker's
to kill a small horse.Oh, no.

40:52.660 --> 40:55.220
Yeah. Yeah.Ugh.

40:55.270 --> 40:56.828
And the end of the
night, you know...

40:56.880 --> 40:59.053
That's a little blurry.Yeah, little bit.

40:59.100 --> 41:02.888
My memory's wiped cleaner than
the Clintons' hard drives.

41:05.760 --> 41:08.843
We should probably,
though, uh...

41:08.900 --> 41:10.891
avoid any...

41:10.940 --> 41:14.239
repeat performances.Definitely.

41:16.250 --> 41:17.501
Yeah.

41:17.560 --> 41:19.039
JASON:
First of all, your top finger,

41:19.080 --> 41:20.729
it's got to be wrapped
around it.

41:20.780 --> 41:23.510
Hold on.
All right, try it again.

41:23.560 --> 41:25.778
Let's see it.

41:25.830 --> 41:27.821
Let 'er rip.

41:33.010 --> 41:34.966
That's not too bad.

41:35.010 --> 41:36.910
Just got to turn your wrist over
a little faster next time.

41:36.970 --> 41:38.312
EMMA:
Mikey's getting good, Dad.

41:38.360 --> 41:41.921
Soon my shot's gonna
be better than yours.No.

41:41.970 --> 41:44.575
As we know, if it's a shot,
it's got to be a goal,

41:44.630 --> 41:47.622
and if it's a goal, it's
got to be Bardownski.

42:12.050 --> 42:15.213
According to the, uh,
calendar you guys made me,

42:15.270 --> 42:16.430
same time tomorrow?

42:16.490 --> 42:17.969
Ithink I can make
that work, Dad.

42:18.010 --> 42:19.227
Wow, I've been gone a day,

42:19.270 --> 42:20.999
and you're already
in some kind of demand.

42:22.190 --> 42:23.532
What was that?

42:37.290 --> 42:39.326
"Muerta."

42:39.380 --> 42:41.416
Marked for death.

42:41.470 --> 42:44.291
Gonzalez identified me.

42:47.080 --> 42:49.036
My family.

42:58.880 --> 43:01.519
Hell of a first day.
